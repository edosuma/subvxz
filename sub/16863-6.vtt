00:01.334 --> 00:02.502
<i>Previously on</i> Rescue Me...

00:02.502 --> 00:04.838
Ten times,
I've called her in the last three days.

00:04.838 --> 00:07.924
And each time I leave, I wanna find out
what the story is with Katy.

00:07.924 --> 00:10.010
Where is she going to school,
blah, blah...

00:10.010 --> 00:11.803
And she doesn't call me back.

00:11.803 --> 00:14.597
The BBC gave me a lot of,
um, old footage.

00:14.597 --> 00:16.141
It has your husband on it.

00:17.225 --> 00:19.394
- Really?
- I'll leave it.

00:19.394 --> 00:21.062
Last time I checked,
this was still America,

00:21.062 --> 00:24.816
and I got a right to a dissenting opinion,
same as you and any other citizen.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.401
You're a firefighter?

00:26.401 --> 00:30.113
I know we said we weren't
gonna go all the way but, I'm glad we did.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.782
You're a very good lover.

00:32.782 --> 00:34.451
Mikey's gonna lead him
through the academy.

00:34.451 --> 00:35.702
Yeah.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.455
And then, Damien's gonna become
the kind of firefighter

00:38.455 --> 00:40.707
that his father always wished he would be.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.792
Mike's an idiot,
Mike's a moron, okay?

00:44.461 --> 00:46.212
We found a tumor on your kidney.

00:46.212 --> 00:48.798
I'm fairly certain it's renal cancer.

00:48.798 --> 00:50.467
You try and use your insurance?

00:51.051 --> 00:52.343
Your as good as off this job.

00:52.343 --> 00:56.431
I can't use the FDNY insurance
that I get for the treatment of a cancer

00:56.431 --> 00:58.892
that I got volunteering
and cleaning up at Ground Zero,

00:58.892 --> 01:01.227
without ending up
stuck behind a desk or fired?

01:01.227 --> 01:03.271
- Yeah.
- Jimmy Keefe.

01:03.271 --> 01:04.522
I, I just...

01:04.522 --> 01:08.401
I was watching news footage from 9/11
and I saw him.

01:08.401 --> 01:11.404
Turn off the television
and get yourself to a meeting.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.656
We all know where this ends if you don't.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.921
- Good meeting so far, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.465
Uh, I wish I had
this one recorded, actually,

01:30.465 --> 01:33.718
so I could play it back in the car
like one of those books on tape.

01:33.718 --> 01:35.595
I mean, it's depressing, Mick. You know?

01:35.595 --> 01:37.555
The homeless guy with no teeth?

01:37.555 --> 01:39.641
The Vietnam vet in the corner?

01:39.641 --> 01:40.809
I mean, what did he say?

01:40.809 --> 01:43.770
He drank 12 Budweisers and three-fifths
in two hours with one arm?

01:43.770 --> 01:45.063
That's hall of fame shit.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.981
That guy should still
be out there drinking,

01:46.981 --> 01:50.443
not sitting in some church hall
listening to pussies like me, you know?

01:50.443 --> 01:52.946
What do you want to do?
You want to, uh, keep drinking?

01:52.946 --> 01:54.906
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact.

01:54.906 --> 01:57.117
I want you to tie one arm behind my back.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.202
I think I could break
the Vietnam vet's record.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.955
I mean, I don't know, Mick,

02:01.955 --> 02:04.124
I'm supposed to be
coming out of these meetings

02:04.124 --> 02:06.417
not wanting to drink,
but it's reverse effect.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.378
I feel like starting all over again.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.548
- Hey, Derek!
- Don't call him over.

02:12.590 --> 02:15.552
I think Tom here needs a little,
uh, positive reinforcement.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.554
- You got the thing?
- What thing?

02:18.221 --> 02:20.098
Yeah, I got it, pally. Hold on a second.

02:20.098 --> 02:23.184
Listen, I didn't want to do this inside
in front of everybody,

02:23.184 --> 02:24.853
'cause I knew you'd get all pissy.

02:24.853 --> 02:28.690
But it is a major milestone,
and I thought it should be celebrated,

02:28.690 --> 02:29.858
and it would be appropriate

02:29.858 --> 02:31.985
if your sponsor here
made the presentation.

02:32.944 --> 02:33.945
What?

02:33.945 --> 02:35.488
Your one-year chip.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.407
You've been sober a whole 12 months.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.950
Congratulations, Tommy.

02:39.659 --> 02:42.245
- I'm proud of you, cousin.
- You were keeping track?

02:42.245 --> 02:43.663
I can't take it.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.999
- You keep it.
- I can't keep it.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.334
I wanna get my own someday,
after I earned it.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.837
- This belongs to you.
- I don't even take medals at work.

02:50.837 --> 02:54.090
I'm not gonna take it for
staying off the juice for a year.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.884
Just take it. Stick it in your pocket.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.677
It'll be a reminder
of what you've achieved

02:57.677 --> 02:59.220
and what you hope to keep achieving.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.306
The only way that's
gonna keep me from drinking

03:01.306 --> 03:03.474
is if I jam it in my windpipe,
let's be honest.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.977
You know what,
you don't want to take it for you,

03:05.977 --> 03:07.228
take it for him.

03:12.525 --> 03:13.651
All right.

03:14.986 --> 03:17.572
You happy? Now I got more shit
to carry around with me.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.490
See that? I told you he'd be thrilled.

03:19.490 --> 03:20.867
Oh. Let's go.

03:21.701 --> 03:24.996
I gotta call the firehouse.
I'll be in there in a sec.

03:25.663 --> 03:28.249
Hey, you've been
really inspirational to me, Tommy.

03:28.249 --> 03:29.334
Thank you.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.418
Yeah...

03:36.674 --> 03:38.092
It's nice, right?

03:39.385 --> 03:42.180
Scared the shit out of me.
Now it's all scratched up.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.682
Yeah, maybe it'd be safer
carrying it in your windpipe.

03:45.767 --> 03:46.768
Come on.

03:52.774 --> 03:56.194
<i>On another day
C'mon, c'mon</i>

03:56.194 --> 03:59.197
<i>With these ropes I tied
Can we do no wrong?</i>

03:59.197 --> 04:02.533
<i>Now we grieve 'cause now is gone</i>

04:02.533 --> 04:05.787
<i>Things were good when we were young</i>

04:05.787 --> 04:08.998
<i>With my teeth locked down
I can see the blood</i>

04:08.998 --> 04:12.210
<i>Of a thousand men
Who have come and gone</i>

04:12.210 --> 04:15.755
<i>Now we grieve 'cause now is gone</i>

04:15.755 --> 04:18.675
<i>Things were good when we were young</i>

04:18.675 --> 04:22.220
<i>-Is it safe to say?
- C'mon, c'mon</i>

04:22.220 --> 04:25.306
<i>-Was it right to leave?
- C'mon, c'mon</i>

04:25.306 --> 04:28.268
<i>- Will I ever learn?
- C'mon, c'mon</i>

04:28.268 --> 04:31.980
<i>C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon</i>

04:39.487 --> 04:40.655
Hey.

04:40.655 --> 04:41.823
Good morning.

04:44.575 --> 04:45.618
Hi.

04:49.747 --> 04:52.959
So I assume you're here to apologize?

04:53.835 --> 04:54.836
For what?

04:56.045 --> 04:59.882
The list of "for whats" would be so long,
I don't even want to get into that.

04:59.882 --> 05:01.968
Let's just stick
with current events, okay?

05:01.968 --> 05:04.095
For taking my daughter
to a private school upstate,

05:04.095 --> 05:06.222
not asking my permission,
you forged my signature--

05:06.222 --> 05:07.974
Okay, Tommy,
I came here to talk about Katy

05:07.974 --> 05:10.601
- but I am not going to apologize.
- Okay. Come here.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.778
Okay, Tommy, no one is here.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.573
- Okay?
- All right.

05:23.573 --> 05:24.949
She's in the school play.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.784
- She's one of the leads.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.745
She feels so bad about lying to you.

05:30.371 --> 05:31.998
Really?

05:31.998 --> 05:33.249
That's funny.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.585
If she felt bad about lying,

05:35.585 --> 05:38.671
I would actually want
to request a, a DNA test,

05:38.671 --> 05:41.215
because that would somehow...

05:41.215 --> 05:43.509
I need proof
that she was a Gavin, you know?

05:43.509 --> 05:44.844
Maybe I'm not the father.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.387
Oh, if only you weren't.

05:48.723 --> 05:49.766
That's great.

05:50.641 --> 05:51.726
That's really great.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.522
Look, Tommy, I'm sorry.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.649
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean for it to go this way.

06:00.401 --> 06:01.486
Ow.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.199
I'm sick of that bullshit.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.909
- Oh, you're sick of it?
- Yeah.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.286
What would you do,
if you had a do-over, huh?

06:10.286 --> 06:12.622
It'd be nice,
if we could all just go back in time

06:12.622 --> 06:14.499
and end up with somebody else, huh?

06:14.499 --> 06:16.042
Who would you pick?

06:16.042 --> 06:17.126
Brian Keegan?

06:17.126 --> 06:18.753
- Oh, God.
- His uncle with the supermarkets?

06:18.753 --> 06:20.505
I bet you he's rolling in it now.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.881
Or Tony Franzoli?

06:21.881 --> 06:23.257
I'm sure you know about him.

06:23.257 --> 06:25.259
He's worth 40 mil now,
got his own law firm?

06:25.259 --> 06:27.178
Yeah, who would
you have ended up with, huh?

06:27.178 --> 06:29.430
Maybe you'd be with your cousin's wife?

06:29.430 --> 06:31.557
Oh, that's right, you did that already.

06:34.852 --> 06:36.979
You think I don't know
about you and Franzoli?

06:36.979 --> 06:40.066
I know all about you and Franzoli
down at the beach that night.

06:40.066 --> 06:43.111
Maggie was there,
she saw every goddamn thing.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.113
- What--
- I know--

06:45.947 --> 06:47.990
You were screwing around with him
at the beach.

06:47.990 --> 06:50.076
- You want to know what, Tommy?
- What?

06:50.076 --> 06:51.953
You're right,
I did, I went down on him.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.163
- And his cock was bigger than yours.
- Shut up!

06:54.831 --> 06:56.624
- Stop it.
- What's going on over there?

06:56.624 --> 06:57.959
What?

07:02.046 --> 07:03.172
You all right?

07:04.298 --> 07:05.508
 Yeah.

07:08.344 --> 07:09.470
Oh, my God, Tommy.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.223
Oh, shit.

07:14.851 --> 07:18.521
Look, you think that I sent her away?

07:19.439 --> 07:20.857
You really think that?

07:20.857 --> 07:22.066
Here. Here.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.529
Tommy, she couldn't wait to get away.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.323
After everything that
she's seen with this family,

07:29.323 --> 07:31.159
- everything we've put her through?
- Yeah.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.119
She begged me, Tommy.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.621
Begged me to go to that school.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.373
Did I want her to go away?

07:37.373 --> 07:38.708
No.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.751
Am I glad that she did?

07:40.751 --> 07:42.003
Yeah.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.379
'Cause she's happy again.

07:43.379 --> 07:47.091
She's smiling again, Tommy,
and the light is behind her eyes again.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.180
So it's a big deal
that she wants us to go to this play.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.764
All right. All right. All right.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.558
- It's a gesture--
- When? When?

07:55.558 --> 07:56.809
Next weekend.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.729
Who's gonna go, me, you and Dwight?

08:00.730 --> 08:03.733
I'll sit in the backseat
and watch you fondle his piss bag.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.443
Well, Dwight is invited,

08:05.443 --> 08:09.280
but he thinks it would be easier for Katy
if you and I just went alone.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.907
- Dwight said that?
- Yeah.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.408
That's awful nice of him.

08:12.408 --> 08:15.661
Must have found a bottle of Percocet
laying around the house.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.040
Okay. Okay.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.792
Sorry. Next weekend.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.170
- You guys all right?
- Yeah.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.506
I don't mean to interrupt,
but, uh, I just need Tommy.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.633
- Okay.
- Okay, uh, we're done.

08:30.092 --> 08:32.428
- Do I look okay?
- Yeah, you're fine.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.764
- Thanks.
- Okay.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.190
What's up?

08:44.190 --> 08:46.234
You guys fightin' or
feelin' each other up?

08:46.234 --> 08:47.401
A little bit of both.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.529
Come on.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.532
What the hell is that?

08:54.325 --> 08:56.285
- You tell me.
- Oh, I sure as shit will.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.454
I pulled it off the goddamn
internet last night.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.998
That's some asshole's
9/11 conspiracy blog.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.458
Why are you looking at that?

09:02.458 --> 09:03.960
Purely shits and giggles.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.670
Only last night, I'm not laughing.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.756
'Cause I see your pretty little face
staring back at me.

09:08.756 --> 09:10.841
"Fireman Rivera of the FDNY."

09:10.841 --> 09:13.094
- Nice going, Franc.
- It's not a big deal, okay?

09:13.094 --> 09:16.347
I went to a rally at Foley Square,
just as an interested citizen.

09:16.347 --> 09:19.433
It's not like I was telling everybody
I'm a firefighter, okay?

09:19.433 --> 09:20.601
Then how did they find out?

09:20.601 --> 09:21.894
You're full of shit.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.772
Look, you got a problem with
what I say or do while I'm on the clock,

09:24.772 --> 09:26.315
it's fine. You talk, I'll listen.

09:26.315 --> 09:29.443
But when I'm not here, what I do,
who I talk to, what I think,

09:29.443 --> 09:30.987
it's none of your goddamn business.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.948
And who the hell you think
you're talking to now, cowboy?

09:34.824 --> 09:36.284
Watch your goddamn tone with me.

09:36.284 --> 09:39.453
We lost all those brothers that day,
I can't ask a goddamn question?

09:39.453 --> 09:42.623
I can't take a closer look
at that joke called the official report?

09:42.623 --> 09:45.835
Franc and I talked about this
'cause I was mad about it too.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.337
But it's a free country,
he can think what he wants.

09:48.337 --> 09:51.632
- Thank you.
- This is shaky ground you're standing on.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.051
Now you got him sticking up for you.

09:54.051 --> 09:56.429
- Feel good?
<i>- Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?</i>

09:56.429 --> 09:57.847
- Oh, boy.
- That's twice.

09:57.847 --> 10:01.225
Look, you guys are all happy
with your heads buried in the sand...

10:01.225 --> 10:03.311
...willfully ignorant, that's fine.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.146
- Franco, come on.
- Willfully ignorant.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.648
- There's a difference.
- Let me remind you of something.

10:07.648 --> 10:10.109
You've been talking about
this conspiracy bullshit a while.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.986
I don't mind if he does it here
in the house.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.113
But you start to carry it
outside the house,

10:14.113 --> 10:16.574
remember one thing,
You represent 62 Truck

10:16.574 --> 10:17.825
wherever you go, okay?

10:17.825 --> 10:21.495
As soon as you leave this house,
you're a member of 62 Truck, remember.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.998
When you're hanging out
with your conspiracy buddies,

10:23.998 --> 10:26.584
whether you're going to one of these
rallies or whatever,

10:26.584 --> 10:30.004
you're still a member of 62 Truck,
not to mention the FDNY, all right?

10:30.004 --> 10:32.340
This conspiracy bullshit,
as you call it...

10:32.340 --> 10:34.091
- Yeah?
- ...it's not just propped up

10:34.091 --> 10:35.718
by a bunch of crackpots and cranks.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.803
- Oh, really?
- No, there's US congressmen--

10:37.803 --> 10:40.973
Oh!

10:40.973 --> 10:42.183
Guys, enough!

10:43.351 --> 10:46.896
What's the matter with you guys?
This is what you're gonna argue about?

10:46.896 --> 10:48.397
Really?

10:48.397 --> 10:51.067
It happened, all right?
It's over! Get over it!

10:51.984 --> 10:54.654
There's other shit going on in the world!

10:56.489 --> 10:58.240
People are dying every day.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.911
All right? Get your head out
of your asses, you assholes.

11:05.247 --> 11:07.458
Holy shit.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.008
- Hi.
- Hey.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.426
How was your day?

11:17.426 --> 11:21.514
Well, you know, a couple of car accidents,
a couple of false alarms,

11:21.514 --> 11:23.349
a fat guy stuck in an elevator.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.143
Typical glitz and glamor of the job.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.062
How about you?

11:30.231 --> 11:31.315
What do I need to do

11:31.315 --> 11:34.443
to get you to share your experience
about that day?

11:37.530 --> 11:41.283
Tell you what, why don't you
just leave a blank page somewhere

11:41.283 --> 11:44.120
in the middle of the book
as, you know, in honor of me.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.330
I just want to go to Ground Zero with you.

11:46.330 --> 11:50.292
I want to hear your perspective
and how you feel and...

11:50.292 --> 11:51.419
Yeah, uh...

11:52.253 --> 11:55.047
I heard you talked to Sheila.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.340
Oh. Yeah, I did.

11:57.174 --> 11:59.260
Great interview. Unique take.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.512
Now, did you... You ran into her here?

12:02.346 --> 12:03.347
The firehouse?

12:04.014 --> 12:08.561
Yeah, I saw her after she saw the footage
of her husband outside the tower,

12:08.561 --> 12:10.104
and then we met.

12:10.104 --> 12:12.064
Did you have multiple copies
of the footage,

12:12.064 --> 12:14.942
or is that the same stuff
you showed to, uh, to Lou?

12:14.942 --> 12:16.402
It's the same I gave Lou.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.112
Are we going tomorrow, or what?

12:19.113 --> 12:20.197
Yes.

12:21.490 --> 12:22.908
Thank you.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.076
All right.

12:26.495 --> 12:27.663
I just don't see the problem.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.540
I mean, most guys would go nuts

12:29.540 --> 12:32.042
over a girl who knows
all that special stuff in bed.

12:32.042 --> 12:35.838
Me, I used to buy magazines that had
articles about new positions and stuff,

12:35.838 --> 12:37.381
leave 'em lying around the house,

12:37.381 --> 12:38.966
- hoping my wife would read them.
- And?

12:38.966 --> 12:40.634
She'd roll 'em up
and hit me with 'em.

12:40.634 --> 12:41.927
But this goes beyond special.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.138
This shit ain't even in the magazines, yo.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.222
All right?

12:45.222 --> 12:47.308
It's not even
in the <i>Kāma-sūtra,</i>

12:47.308 --> 12:49.185
the positions that we're doing.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.896
There's ice and peanut butter,
whipped cream, marshmallows--

12:51.896 --> 12:53.647
Now you got me all confused.

12:53.647 --> 12:55.524
I don't know whether I'm horny or hungry.

12:55.524 --> 12:58.110
- And then there's the biting.
- Biting where?

12:59.028 --> 13:00.237
Jesus Christ.

13:00.237 --> 13:04.700
It's not right when the man
knows less in the sack than his lady does.

13:04.700 --> 13:05.910
I gotta get out of this.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.120
Yeah, what are you gonna do
about the father?

13:08.120 --> 13:09.330
Shit.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.414
Right.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.000
How do I tell Tommy his daughter's a slut?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.669
By phone, from another state,

13:15.669 --> 13:18.339
in a room with no windows
that open to the street.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.549
You know he's still gonna find you.

13:23.385 --> 13:26.347
So you've had a few days
to digest the diagnosis.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.140
- Mmm-hmm.
- How you doing?

13:28.140 --> 13:29.642
Are the painkillers working?

13:29.642 --> 13:30.893
Um, I guess.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.062
I don't take 'em that much
'cause of work, but...

13:33.062 --> 13:34.855
Oh, I cried a couple of times.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.148
That was weird.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.275
But nobody saw me, so it's okay.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.861
Pretty much,
the whole thing blows, if you ask me.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.074
So, what are my options at this point?

13:45.074 --> 13:47.326
Are we thinking about
the whole chemo thing, or...

13:47.326 --> 13:49.245
- Uh, probably not.
- Okay.

13:49.245 --> 13:52.623
Kidney cancers, by and large,
are resistant to chemotherapy.

13:52.623 --> 13:54.416
Same with radiation therapy.

13:55.292 --> 13:57.378
We could try immunotherapy.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.171
Oh, hey, that sounds cool. What's that?

13:59.171 --> 14:03.551
Well, we use some pretty serious drugs
to boost your body's immune system.

14:03.551 --> 14:06.053
- Mmm-hmm.
- You're young, you're in good shape.

14:06.053 --> 14:08.514
You could probably handle
the side effects.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.723
Okay, what are those?

14:10.391 --> 14:12.268
Jeez, let me think, um...

14:12.268 --> 14:16.772
Extreme exhaustion,
low blood pressure, uh,

14:16.772 --> 14:20.442
liquid buildup in the lungs,
uh, difficulty breathing,

14:20.442 --> 14:22.111
renal damage, heart attack...

14:22.862 --> 14:26.574
- Jesus.
- ...intestinal bleeding, diarrhea, uh,

14:26.574 --> 14:31.453
high, high fever and chills,
rapid heartbeat, mental changes.

14:31.453 --> 14:32.830
Uh, mental changes?

14:32.830 --> 14:36.876
Oh, so I could, you know, like,
it could make me smarter?

14:39.378 --> 14:42.423
I think surgery is the way to go, Sean.

14:42.423 --> 14:46.010
I go in, I remove the whole kidney,
it's not too invasive.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.803
And the attached renal gland,

14:47.803 --> 14:51.098
as well as the fatty tissue
around the kidney.

14:51.765 --> 14:54.768
Well, sweet, I get to lose a few lbs.
out of the deal, that's great.

14:54.768 --> 14:56.854
Okay, I just have one final question.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.731
- And I can answer that question.
- Uh-huh.

14:58.731 --> 15:02.276
Most people are perfectly fine
living their lives with only one kidney.

15:03.277 --> 15:08.699
Yeah, no, I was just gonna ask, you know,
how much is it to pop the kidney out?

15:08.699 --> 15:11.243
Well, you're insured
through the Fire Department, right?

15:11.243 --> 15:14.246
I mean, you'd better be,
or I'm gonna ask you to leave right now.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.628
Ah, come on, that's funny.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.963
Oh, you were--
Yeah, that's very funny. Yes.

15:22.963 --> 15:24.506
I, uh, (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) yeah.

15:24.506 --> 15:26.550
No, see, I can't use my insurance company.

15:26.550 --> 15:29.637
I don't want the Fire Department
to know what's going on.

15:29.637 --> 15:33.015
But, it's my health, so it doesn't matter.
Whatever the cost, it's fine.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.935
Well, it's, it's about $12,000.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.479
Holy shit.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.523
Really? Holy shit. That's...

15:42.858 --> 15:44.652
Then how much for the other thing?

15:44.652 --> 15:47.655
You know, the renal damage, fluid buildup,

15:47.655 --> 15:50.616
heart attack, you know,
make me smarter thing?

15:52.368 --> 15:55.496
Yeah, you're right,
the, the other one's probably better.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.418
Hey, place looks great, huh?

16:01.418 --> 16:02.544
Yeah.

16:03.587 --> 16:04.964
What did you do?

16:04.964 --> 16:06.966
Yeah, well, I got a new,
uh, stacking technique.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.051
- Ah, stacking.
- Yeah.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.344
Look what I found.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.221
This little table over here,

16:12.221 --> 16:15.265
I figure we could actually,
you know, eat off of it,

16:15.265 --> 16:17.351
or, uh, we could break it apart

16:17.351 --> 16:19.853
and use the legs
to kill some of the bigger bugs.

16:19.853 --> 16:21.146
Oh, and there's pizza.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.649
Oh, good, 'cause I'm starving.

16:23.649 --> 16:27.861
Goddamn, these bugs are big and organized.

16:27.861 --> 16:28.946
Hmm.

16:30.197 --> 16:32.616
Um, the bugs, did they, uh...

16:33.701 --> 16:37.371
They didn't, uh, take that 9/11
footage that you had, did they?

16:37.371 --> 16:39.707
- No, it's around here somewhere.
- Okay.

16:39.707 --> 16:42.710
You know, the 9/11 footage
that had Jimmy, uh, Keefe in it?

16:44.169 --> 16:46.213
- You got something to say, Tom?
- Huh?

16:46.213 --> 16:47.923
- You got something to say?
- Me?

16:47.923 --> 16:50.592
- Yeah.
- Nothing.

16:50.592 --> 16:51.885
Hmm.

16:53.303 --> 16:54.430
Well...

16:55.681 --> 16:58.142
I've known you a long time, Lou.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.643
And you know I love you.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.396
Blah, blah, blah.

17:03.105 --> 17:06.483
But I gotta say,
in all the years I've known you,

17:06.483 --> 17:09.153
you've pulled some
pretty low-rent moves,

17:09.153 --> 17:11.405
and most of 'em
are pretty goddamn funny.

17:11.405 --> 17:13.824
But I don't think
you've ever been as low-rent

17:15.576 --> 17:17.870
as this latest move that you pulled.

17:17.870 --> 17:23.125
Using footage from 9/11
to try to bait and hook

17:24.126 --> 17:28.172
a chick that you haven't
the slightest shot with.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.841
- Mmm-hmm.
- That's pretty unbelievable.

17:30.841 --> 17:33.052
So you're saying
I don't have a shot at Genevieve?

17:33.052 --> 17:34.386
Oh, you don't have a prayer.

17:34.386 --> 17:39.266
You don't even have a whisper
of a wish with that broad.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.810
Let's think about this.
This broad comes from France.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.771
She's a journalist,
travels around the world.

17:43.771 --> 17:47.024
So she's, French guys are a given,
British, I mean, name a country.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.400
But she comes to America.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.737
And the guy that she's gonna pick
to hang around with is you?

17:51.737 --> 17:53.655
Uh, let me get this straight. Right? Okay?

17:53.655 --> 17:56.700
An overweight, divorced,
uh, middle-aged fireman.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.410
- That's who she's gonna pick?
- Maybe.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.120
You're forgetting something important.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.790
Oh, yeah, I forgot the fact
that you're almost...

18:02.790 --> 18:04.458
You're living like a homeless person.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.877
Bring her over.
This will impress the shit out of her.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.713
See, what you're forgetting,
my little thistle-dicked friend,

18:09.713 --> 18:11.548
okay, is this.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.008
- Uh-huh.
- She's a writer.

18:13.008 --> 18:15.594
- Oh! I forgot about the writer.
- I'm a writer.

18:15.594 --> 18:16.678
That's right. Of course!

18:16.678 --> 18:18.222
She's a writer, and you're a writer.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.849
And she's been published,
but, of course, you haven't.

18:20.849 --> 18:22.976
- You know what? Keep it up, Tommy!
- Yeah.

18:22.976 --> 18:24.853
You're gonna be wearing these table legs.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.563
- Oh, physical violence!
- The threat of!

18:26.563 --> 18:28.524
- All right, okay.
- Yeah, it just happened.

18:28.524 --> 18:31.985
All right. I'm just trying to imagine,
okay, her point of view on this.

18:31.985 --> 18:33.987
She walks into our goddamn firehouse.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.572
- Uh-huh.
- And here's her options.

18:35.572 --> 18:36.907
- Franco, okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.367
- Franco and then--
- Here it comes.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.952
- What? What?
- Here it... The inevitable.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.412
The inevitable.
That it's all gonna end up with you.

18:42.412 --> 18:45.499
I wasn't gonna talk about me. I was gonna
talk about everybody else but me.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.167
- Ha! Yeah. Sure.
- Okay? And you.

18:47.167 --> 18:48.919
- Let's talk about me, okay?
- Yeah.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.295
She's hit on me twice already.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.755
- Uh-huh.
- I can't speak for Franco.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.257
- Me, twice, okay?
- I'm sure she has.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.759
- Has she hit on you?
- Yeah, I'm not gonna answer that.

18:56.343 --> 18:57.970
- She hasn't hit on you.
- I'm not gonna--

18:57.970 --> 18:59.888
- She's never gonna hit on you.
- And you--

18:59.888 --> 19:02.307
She's hit on you,
and yet you haven't banged her yet.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.517
- No--
- Let's figure this out.

19:03.517 --> 19:04.893
How could this possibly happen?

19:04.893 --> 19:09.022
How could Tommy Gavin,
the 6'3 Velcro penis that you are,

19:09.022 --> 19:10.774
not have banged a woman so far?

19:10.774 --> 19:12.860
- I am trying something different.
- You know why?

19:12.860 --> 19:14.862
- You're intimidated by her.
- I'm not intimidated--

19:14.862 --> 19:16.572
- She's got a brain.
- That's why--

19:16.572 --> 19:17.781
And she's intelligent.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.992
And she's sophisticated.
And she's urbane.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.702
- You don't know what to do with her.
- Urbane?

19:21.702 --> 19:25.581
- Yeah. Or option B, Tom, which is that--
- What?

19:25.581 --> 19:28.417
Maybe your dick ain't working again?
I'm just spitballing.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.919
Okay, right, great.
Let's get even more low-rent, okay?

19:30.919 --> 19:32.504
- My dick works fine, okay?
- Yeah.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.715
- Did you just accuse me...?
- I did.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.675
- I don't need to cockblock you.
- Why?

19:36.675 --> 19:39.678
Go take a look in the mirror.
You're a cockblock on your own!

19:39.678 --> 19:41.722
What you're telling me
as my best friend is that

19:41.722 --> 19:44.016
not in a million years
would this girl think about...

19:44.016 --> 19:45.726
- Never!
- ...taking me to bed, right?

19:45.726 --> 19:47.686
The reptilian,
repugnant creature that I am?

19:47.686 --> 19:49.813
Your words. Reptilian, yeah, your words.

19:49.813 --> 19:52.774
The word I was gonna use was fool.
You're a goddamn fool!

19:52.774 --> 19:55.277
I have been a goddamn fool,
because all these years,

19:55.277 --> 19:58.447
- I thought we were friends. And we're not.
- Oh, yeah, the friend speech!

19:58.447 --> 20:00.157
There's no being friends with you.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.242
- The self-pity speech. No.
- I'm not your friend.

20:02.242 --> 20:04.203
You got no friends.
You wanna know what I am?

20:04.203 --> 20:06.163
I'm a little overweight satellite

20:06.163 --> 20:10.000
orbiting around the planet
Tommy in the universe of Gavin.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.295
I'm the idiot who coddles you
when you're cranky

20:13.295 --> 20:15.839
and recounts past glories when you're down

20:17.132 --> 20:21.720
and makes excuses and apologies for you
when you shit all over everybody.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.973
And you behave like the miserable,
selfish prick that you are.

20:24.973 --> 20:27.559
And you know what?
All of this time, I thought that maybe

20:27.559 --> 20:31.313
there was gonna be something for me
after all these years of servitude.

20:32.397 --> 20:35.859
And that makes me
a bigger asshole than you,

20:35.859 --> 20:37.653
and I didn't think that was possible.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.949
So you know what, I'm going out,
because it's starting to stink in here.

20:46.578 --> 20:47.955
Hey. Hey. Hey.

20:47.955 --> 20:52.125
Hey, don't forget to get some orange juice
while you're out there orbiting around!

20:52.876 --> 20:54.127
Fat-ass!

21:10.227 --> 21:11.770
What was the deal with you? Hey!

21:11.770 --> 21:13.981
In the basement,
wandering off like that. Why?

21:13.981 --> 21:16.275
I wasn't wandering,
I was doing a sweep with Lou.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.402
Somebody should tell
the king of all douchebags

21:18.402 --> 21:20.570
that's not standard operating procedure.

21:20.570 --> 21:23.115
It's not standard
operating procedure, Mikey.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.328
The king of all douchebag's
up front, asshole.

21:28.328 --> 21:31.873
Please inform the shit of all shits
that I cleared it with the chief

21:31.873 --> 21:34.459
and that he should just mind
his own goddamn business.

21:34.459 --> 21:35.711
Huh? Oh, okay.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.130
Well, somebody want to tell
the Turdmaster General

21:38.130 --> 21:41.258
that the chief received
an unclear radio transmission

21:41.258 --> 21:42.968
from the aforementioned Turdmaster.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.262
Therefore, the whole thing was not okay.

21:45.262 --> 21:47.014
Who's the Turdmaster?

21:47.014 --> 21:48.640
Who do you think the Turdmaster is?

21:49.891 --> 21:51.977
I thought
he was the king of all douchebags.

21:51.977 --> 21:55.063
No, I fell in love with a commoner,
and I had to abdicate my crown.

21:55.063 --> 21:58.483
Which was actually a douchebag
with the word "crown" written on it.

21:59.735 --> 22:02.195
Ask the Grand Sphincter
if he thought that was funny.

22:02.195 --> 22:04.114
You think that was funny?

22:04.114 --> 22:05.741
You think I'm the Grand Sphincter?

22:06.825 --> 22:08.702
Uh, I don't know, I just assumed.

22:08.702 --> 22:11.538
What about me says
"sphincter" to you? Huh?

22:11.538 --> 22:14.333
Uh-uh-uh. Shut up. Two of yous.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.043
Just for that, you know what?

22:16.043 --> 22:19.338
From now on, you're the, uh...
Prince of Anal Leakage.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.922
That's who you are.

22:20.922 --> 22:24.676
All right, somebody inform the debu-taint
that the Prince of Anal Leakage

22:24.676 --> 22:27.179
is a friend of the court
of the King of the Douchebags.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.430
And he should just lay off.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.015
I thought you abdicated the crown.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.475
- Are you talkin' to me?
- No.

22:31.475 --> 22:33.018
Good. Don't say anything.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.770
I can say whatever I want.
You know what?

22:34.770 --> 22:35.854
See these two helmets?

22:35.854 --> 22:37.522
- No, I'm looking this way.
- All right.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.733
These two helmets
divide the back kingdom

22:39.733 --> 22:42.235
from the front kingdom,
and I'm the king of the back.

22:42.235 --> 22:44.780
I'm the king of the front kingdom,
and I can hear you talking,

22:44.780 --> 22:46.823
- so just shut up.
- You shut up!

22:46.823 --> 22:48.617
You two gotta stop livin' together.

22:52.788 --> 22:53.789
Whoo!

22:54.706 --> 22:56.500
That was hot, boys.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.001
That was very, uh--

22:58.001 --> 22:59.461
Hey, hey, hey.

22:59.461 --> 23:02.255
Hey, where's fireman Franco at?

23:02.255 --> 23:04.508
He's right here.
Who's looking for him?

23:04.508 --> 23:06.551
- That's the guy.
- What's goin' on?

23:06.551 --> 23:08.136
We wanna talk to you, asshole.

23:08.136 --> 23:10.555
Hey, aren't you, uh,
Harris from the Bronx?

23:10.555 --> 23:12.557
Brooklyn. Stay out of this, blondie.

23:13.558 --> 23:15.352
Call me blond--
He called me "blondie."

23:15.352 --> 23:17.938
What the hell's goin' on down
here, guys, huh?

23:17.938 --> 23:20.148
Maybe you fairies got no
problem with this asshole

23:20.148 --> 23:22.526
going around pissing
on the memories of our brothers.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.111
All right. You know what?

23:24.111 --> 23:27.864
In this situation,
I may agree with you that he's an asshole.

23:27.864 --> 23:28.949
Okay?

23:28.949 --> 23:30.742
But he's also our asshole.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.077
Let's think for a second.

23:32.077 --> 23:35.539
If we get involved in a jam up here,
we're all gonna get written up.

23:35.539 --> 23:37.916
Somebody gets hurt,
we have to fill out paperwork.

23:37.916 --> 23:40.210
We got headquarters on top,
it's the new FDNY...

23:40.210 --> 23:42.295
Tommy, they talkin' shit.

23:42.295 --> 23:44.256
why don't we just relax?
We'll talk to him.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.550
I guarantee you that this is done with.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.093
All right? Truce?

23:48.927 --> 23:50.262
- Yeah.
- All right.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.430
Watch your mouth.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.141
Let's go, boys.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.436
Jesus. Wow.

23:57.436 --> 23:58.937
Hit the bricks, blondie.

23:58.937 --> 24:00.188
- Hey, hey.
- Yeah.

24:00.188 --> 24:02.357
I know Taekwondo, son.

24:02.357 --> 24:03.483
Yeah.

24:03.483 --> 24:07.320
Don't make me unleash the master
Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan shit on you, son.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.780
- Sean!
- I'll get you up--

24:14.703 --> 24:15.996
Sean?

24:18.832 --> 24:20.125
All right. Hey!

24:29.426 --> 24:30.635
Break it up!

24:31.928 --> 24:34.181
Garrity, get that goddamn door down!

24:34.181 --> 24:35.557
That's enough!

24:41.271 --> 24:42.272
Christ.

24:42.272 --> 24:45.525
I said, enough!

24:45.525 --> 24:48.153
What the hell is going on here?

24:49.654 --> 24:51.406
Somebody better start talking to me.

24:51.406 --> 24:54.367
Just a little misunderstanding, Chief.
It got out of hand, okay?

24:54.367 --> 24:56.703
You know you got a guy talking
shit about 9/11 over here?

24:58.413 --> 25:00.081
See what happens?

25:00.081 --> 25:02.417
My guys, in the kitchen now.

25:02.417 --> 25:04.294
- The rest of you--
- Get in the kitchen.

25:04.294 --> 25:06.296
What's the matter with you guys?

25:06.296 --> 25:08.340
I'll be in the kitchen.

25:09.216 --> 25:12.302
The rest of you,
I see you within 10 feet of this place,

25:12.302 --> 25:15.388
I make one phone call,
I get you busted back to probie school.

25:15.388 --> 25:16.681
You understand me?

25:16.681 --> 25:17.974
Get out of my house.

25:17.974 --> 25:19.351
- It's not over.
- Jesus.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.228
That's the way you're gonna end it?

25:21.228 --> 25:22.437
Asshole.

25:22.437 --> 25:23.688
Move.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.322
Smacked him like crazy.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.032
See, that's what I do.

25:37.452 --> 25:38.870
What was that?

25:39.996 --> 25:41.498
What the hell was that?

25:41.498 --> 25:44.251
Barely got off the rig,
they, they jumped us.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.753
Like, 12, 13 guys.

25:46.753 --> 25:48.797
They came for Franc.
We had to get his back.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.423
Well, hard to imagine.

25:51.258 --> 25:54.219
You happy with the public relations job
you're doing here?

25:54.219 --> 25:56.263
Because I think it sucks.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.223
And now the rest of you shitheads--

25:58.223 --> 26:00.934
Hey, what would...
I mean, we had to respond.

26:00.934 --> 26:03.103
You got a problem with us
standing up for one of our own?

26:03.103 --> 26:04.980
They threw the first punch, chief.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.189
Here's my problem.

26:07.107 --> 26:09.276
I'm never gonna walk into my house

26:09.276 --> 26:11.570
and see the third period
at a Ranger game going on

26:11.570 --> 26:13.488
with the goddamn bay door wide open

26:13.488 --> 26:15.657
so the whole goddamn
neighborhood can see!

26:15.657 --> 26:17.701
Maybe you idiots haven't heard.

26:17.701 --> 26:19.911
They got this new thing,
cameras in phones.

26:19.911 --> 26:21.454
Everybody's got one.

26:21.454 --> 26:24.374
I bet I'll be getting calls from <i>The Post</i>
before the day is out?

26:24.374 --> 26:25.834
And then headquarters?

26:25.834 --> 26:28.378
And that's not even
the goddamn issue here!

26:28.378 --> 26:31.256
You got no goddamn respect for me, do you?

26:31.256 --> 26:33.174
Oh, come on.
Of course we do, chief.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.927
That's not true, chief, we respect you.

26:38.888 --> 26:40.515
I'm not a real chief, right?

26:40.682 --> 26:42.934
Not at all. That's not what...

26:42.934 --> 26:45.228
We're gonna get this out
on the table right now,

26:45.228 --> 26:47.439
'cause I know
that's what everybody's thinking.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.690
I only got bumped up

26:48.690 --> 26:51.067
because we lost so many
experienced guys at 9/11,

26:51.067 --> 26:52.652
or to retirement right after that.

26:52.652 --> 26:54.613
Okay, what am I, some kind of idiot?

26:54.613 --> 26:56.573
You don't think I don't know that?

26:56.573 --> 26:59.993
You don't think I wasn't pissing
myself coming in here as the boss?

26:59.993 --> 27:02.621
Fine. Okay. Maybe it's my fault.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.749
I figure, "I'll come in as your pal
instead of the guy in charge.

27:05.749 --> 27:08.543
"Maybe then, you won't
notice me crapping my pants."

27:08.543 --> 27:10.795
I don't give a shit
if it's my fault or not.

27:10.795 --> 27:12.464
It stops now.

27:13.548 --> 27:16.801
The next time
I give you assholes an order,

27:16.801 --> 27:18.553
you better goddamn obey it.

27:21.056 --> 27:24.809
Maybe you're just blowing this whole thing
a little out of proportion.

27:27.228 --> 27:28.355
Chief.

27:31.024 --> 27:33.652
- Chief.
- You think, Lou? Hmm?

27:33.652 --> 27:35.904
You think Feinberg
comes in here five minutes ago,

27:35.904 --> 27:39.491
sees that mess on my floor, sees me
totally incapable of stopping it...

27:39.491 --> 27:41.743
I'd get bounced right
out of the department.

27:43.787 --> 27:46.456
Maybe you gotta be a real asshole
to be a good chief.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.834
Well, I guess we're gonna find that out.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.419
Sheesh.

27:56.383 --> 27:58.051
- Sorry, Franc.
- Way to go, Franc.

28:10.980 --> 28:12.732
You got anything to add, Tom?

28:19.489 --> 28:21.282
Nope.

28:26.079 --> 28:27.330
Yeah.

28:29.249 --> 28:33.128
You might want to have some of your
conspiracy buff friends come down and, uh,

28:34.254 --> 28:37.006
walk you to your car
when you're done with work tonight.

28:44.055 --> 28:45.557
Are going to the gym?

28:45.557 --> 28:48.143
No, I'm going to the bar.
I gotta go hide this cash.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.812
- What cash?
- From the bar, the profits.

28:50.812 --> 28:53.481
Dude,
I got, like, 24 grand in here.

28:53.481 --> 28:54.691
Okay.

28:54.691 --> 28:57.068
Wait, if this is profit,
how much of its mine?

28:57.068 --> 28:58.319
- None.
- Bullshit, bro.

28:58.319 --> 29:00.196
- If that's profit, some of it's mine.
- No.

29:00.196 --> 29:02.323
Franc said we can't touch it
for almost a year.

29:02.323 --> 29:03.908
We gotta buy booze and pay the bills.

29:03.908 --> 29:07.287
And we need money
to bribe that guy from the state.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.372
I'm gonna go hide this in the office.

29:09.372 --> 29:11.082
I got a better idea.

29:11.082 --> 29:12.584
Give it to me, I'll hide it.

29:12.584 --> 29:15.128
- No, no, I got it.
- Come on, you know how you are.

29:15.128 --> 29:17.088
You'll be at a bar, drunk,
talking to a chick.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.631
There'll be a pause, you'll be like,

29:18.631 --> 29:22.302
"I have a huge bag of cash in the office.
Wanna come see?"

29:22.302 --> 29:24.304
- Come on, dude. I'm--
- Mike.

29:30.351 --> 29:31.436
Yeah.

29:31.436 --> 29:34.105
Dude, you're really smart sometimes, dude.

29:34.105 --> 29:36.691
"Sometimes," he says.

29:38.818 --> 29:40.945
Hey, Sheila, how's it going?

29:40.945 --> 29:42.322
Franco. Pretty good.

29:42.322 --> 29:43.406
Yeah?

29:43.406 --> 29:45.575
I hear Damien's starting up
probie school.

29:45.575 --> 29:47.118
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

29:47.118 --> 29:49.871
We got him in late to the new class.

29:49.871 --> 29:53.541
He's missed a couple of weeks,
but Mikey's gonna keep him all caught up.

29:53.541 --> 29:55.293
Yeah? Mikey's gonna help out?

29:55.293 --> 29:58.046
That's something you don't hear too often,
as in ever.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.589
Hmm.

29:59.589 --> 30:03.301
So, uh,
what's with this website thing you're on?

30:04.385 --> 30:05.553
You heard about that?

30:05.553 --> 30:08.473
One of the other widows,
she keeps track of the blogs.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.517
Yeah, well, I've done a lot of reading.

30:10.517 --> 30:12.727
- I can tell you some stuff.
- I don't wanna know.

30:12.727 --> 30:15.313
- There were bombs in those--
- I don't want to know.

30:15.313 --> 30:17.524
I'm just asking questions, okay?

30:17.524 --> 30:20.944
Not out of fear,
not out of disrespect, but because I can.

30:20.944 --> 30:23.196
- This country was founded on dissent.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.824
I realize these days,
that's called being unpatriotic...

30:25.824 --> 30:30.286
Oh, I could give a shit
about you being unpatriotic.

30:31.287 --> 30:33.998
Just do me one favor.

30:33.998 --> 30:36.334
What? What do you want me to do?

30:37.919 --> 30:42.090
Don't turn
my husband's death into a hobby.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.642
That's the Deutsche Bank building.

30:52.642 --> 30:54.185
It's still eating firemen.

30:54.185 --> 30:56.521
You know,
we see these people coming and going.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.398
They do this all day, every day.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.608
They don't really give
a shit anymore about it.

31:00.608 --> 31:03.736
And the truth is,
when the Twin Towers were standing,

31:04.612 --> 31:06.239
they looked like shit.

31:06.239 --> 31:07.574
Everybody forgets that now.

31:07.574 --> 31:11.578
They used to have magazine articles every
couple of years about how ugly they were,

31:11.578 --> 31:14.497
how they loomed
over the rest of Manhattan.

31:15.456 --> 31:17.500
Come on,
I'm gonna show you a different view.

31:23.256 --> 31:26.050
Three, and four.

31:26.050 --> 31:28.136
24,400.

31:28.803 --> 31:30.763
And my cut, let's see...

31:32.473 --> 31:33.766
Shit. Uh, hello?

31:33.766 --> 31:35.226
Somebody in there?

31:35.226 --> 31:37.687
Uh, oh, hey, Franc.
Uh, what's going on, man?

31:37.687 --> 31:39.981
I need my keys. What are you doing?

31:39.981 --> 31:41.691
Nothing. I'll be out in a sec.

31:41.691 --> 31:43.818
I'm just, um, I'm jerkin' off.

31:43.818 --> 31:44.986
I...

31:45.862 --> 31:47.113
You're jerkin' off?

31:47.113 --> 31:50.116
Yep. And I'm almost done,
so just hang on one sec.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.035
Oh, yeah.

31:52.035 --> 31:53.870
Seriously, I need my keys right now.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.413
Oh, work it, daddy.

31:56.164 --> 31:57.498
Ooh, yeah. Work it out.

31:57.498 --> 31:58.958
Work it out.

31:58.958 --> 32:00.627
She's gonna blow!

32:08.509 --> 32:10.887
- Hey, bro.
- Hey.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.263
Here's your keys.

32:14.849 --> 32:15.975
Thank you.

32:15.975 --> 32:17.477
Cleanup on aisle five.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.356
This is my business partner.

32:22.482 --> 32:23.733
Great.

32:26.861 --> 32:28.446
Thank you.

32:28.446 --> 32:29.656
Here you go. Enjoy.

32:31.282 --> 32:32.951
Uh, you're drinking?

32:32.951 --> 32:37.455
No. It's a little, uh,
trick I learned from my sponsor.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.540
It's, um... I don't drink it.

32:39.540 --> 32:41.584
I just order a drink, and I let it sit.

32:41.584 --> 32:43.336
Uh, it works, actually.

32:44.337 --> 32:49.384
Just the fumes alone remind me
of a place I don't want to go to.

32:49.384 --> 32:50.468
Mmm.

32:51.344 --> 32:53.388
Are you haunted, Tommy?

32:58.810 --> 33:01.229
What's that supposed to mean?

33:03.272 --> 33:07.443
So, um, how many times have
you been visited by your cousin?

33:09.487 --> 33:10.947
What do you want me to say?

33:12.156 --> 33:13.282
The truth?

33:13.282 --> 33:16.953
You know,
I'm sure you've heard every, uh,

33:18.705 --> 33:22.291
angle from talking to people
in the firehouse about this.

33:22.291 --> 33:25.420
But I'll run it down for you,
what really happened, okay?

33:25.420 --> 33:27.922
Coming down here that day,
everybody knew,

33:29.465 --> 33:34.971
uh, you know,
this was something extraordinary.

33:34.971 --> 33:37.223
It wasn't a normal
run-of-the-mill call, obviously.

33:37.223 --> 33:38.474
I think some of the young guys,

33:38.474 --> 33:40.309
when we got in the lobby
of the first tower,

33:40.309 --> 33:42.228
they probably thought
it was a death sentence.

33:42.228 --> 33:43.688
Not necessarily true.

33:43.688 --> 33:46.149
The older guys like myself,
we were looking at it like,

33:46.149 --> 33:48.568
"This is a big call, but it's a call."

33:48.568 --> 33:51.029
We were sent up. Jimmy started to go.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.447
This lady's purse spilled.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.240
Instinct, I reacted,

33:54.949 --> 33:58.202
one of the other guys picking stuff
up off the floor, helping her.

33:58.202 --> 33:59.287
I was a little late.

33:59.287 --> 34:00.747
I caught up to Jimmy.

34:00.747 --> 34:03.124
We came down, a couple of grabs.

34:03.124 --> 34:04.333
He had two. I had one.

34:04.333 --> 34:08.629
And he was joking with me how, you know,
he was making me look bad again.

34:08.629 --> 34:11.090
We handed them off.

34:11.090 --> 34:14.093
And, uh, you know,
then I kind of lost track of him.

34:14.927 --> 34:18.598
I don't, uh,
really have any regrets.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.224
I don't live my life that way.

34:20.224 --> 34:23.394
I'm not a "shoulda, woulda, coulda"
kind of guy.

34:23.394 --> 34:28.733
And I thought he,
uh, went in the first tower.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.109
And I was okay with that.

34:31.277 --> 34:34.489
Everybody talks about, uh, that day.

34:34.489 --> 34:36.199
Nobody talks about what it was,

34:36.199 --> 34:38.618
which was the single
greatest rescue mission

34:38.618 --> 34:40.536
in the history
of the goddamn fire service.

34:40.536 --> 34:42.622
That's how I look at it.
3,000 people dead.

34:42.622 --> 34:43.748
But you know what?

34:44.707 --> 34:45.792
Shoulda, woulda, coulda.

34:45.792 --> 34:47.627
Think about the numbers
that would have been

34:47.627 --> 34:51.047
if we hadn't have done the job we did
that day. I was fine with it.

34:51.631 --> 34:54.842
When you came up
with this footage and this idea,

34:55.468 --> 34:59.180
this proof that he actually
went into the second tower...

35:00.932 --> 35:03.476
That's a little different.
That's, you know...

35:05.103 --> 35:10.316
If I had known, you know, where he was,
I could have gone in.

35:10.316 --> 35:13.778
Maybe I would have been able to grab him.

35:13.778 --> 35:16.572
You know, if we had
an extra 45 minutes that day,

35:16.572 --> 35:19.117
I think we could have gotten
everybody out.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.369
So it just makes me, you know...

35:25.331 --> 35:30.044
Either I could have gotten him out,
or we both would have been in there.

35:30.044 --> 35:31.295
Whatever.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.006
Either way, you know...

35:36.717 --> 35:39.137
We would be together, uh, right now.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.638
You know?

35:40.638 --> 35:44.684
Sometimes, uh,
when I'm falling asleep at night,

35:44.684 --> 35:48.271
I have this weird thing.

35:48.271 --> 35:52.775
I think I'm him,
and I'm inside the first tower,

35:52.775 --> 35:55.319
and it's coming down on top of me,

35:55.319 --> 35:58.573
and it's like the last few seconds,
and then it goes black.

35:58.573 --> 36:01.826
I think it's a normal thing
for people who lose somebody

36:01.826 --> 36:03.202
in an accident of any kind,

36:03.202 --> 36:05.621
is just wondering
what the last few seconds were like.

36:07.874 --> 36:12.044
My wife, uh,
says that makes me a narcissist.

36:14.380 --> 36:17.049
This coming from a woman who can't walk by

36:17.049 --> 36:20.094
a storefront window
without looking at her own ass.

36:22.054 --> 36:23.222
Whatever.

36:26.058 --> 36:30.062
What if you never see him again?

36:36.485 --> 36:37.695
Yeah.

36:46.787 --> 36:48.122
Let's go.

36:50.082 --> 36:51.292
Um...

37:11.395 --> 37:14.148
It's tough, dude.
They told me I gotta cut my hair off.

37:14.148 --> 37:16.150
All the guys in my class
are bigger than me,

37:16.150 --> 37:18.486
they can press more than me,
carry more gear.

37:18.486 --> 37:20.863
Hey, no worries.
You just gotta bulk up.

37:20.863 --> 37:24.575
I got this killer protein shake
that kicks ass for packing on the lbs.

37:24.575 --> 37:26.619
- Yeah? You gotta get me that.
- I'm on it.

37:26.619 --> 37:29.664
And, uh,
hey, how about a real drink, huh?

37:29.664 --> 37:30.748
As in, booze?

37:30.748 --> 37:33.292
I don't think you're old enough
to be drinking, D.

37:33.292 --> 37:35.253
Who cares? You own the place.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.462
Come on.

37:36.462 --> 37:38.506
Hook a brother up
with a Long Island iced tea.

37:38.506 --> 37:39.882
Who's gonna know?

37:40.299 --> 37:41.509
I will.

37:42.093 --> 37:44.262
Besides, I told your mom
I'm watching out for you.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.889
I'm not gonna send you to school
all hung over.

37:46.889 --> 37:48.975
You're already
playing catch-up as it is.

37:48.975 --> 37:50.226
I can handle one drink.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.186
I'll tell you what.

37:52.186 --> 37:55.147
You don't even have to give me
the good stuff, give me the shit.

37:55.147 --> 37:57.233
That's all we serve,
is shit, and that's a no.

37:57.233 --> 37:58.734
- Hey, douchebag.
- Hey.

37:58.734 --> 38:00.278
No, not you, D. You.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.113
I just got done counting the money before.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.699
It's 21,000 and change.
Get your head out of your ass.

38:04.699 --> 38:07.702
No, it's not, dude. It's 24,000.
I counted it, like, five times.

38:07.702 --> 38:09.745
Well, then, you counted
it wrong five times.

38:09.745 --> 38:11.122
It's 21,000 and change.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.541
- Shitballs.
- Yeah. Exactly.

38:14.709 --> 38:18.004
Don't tell Franc, 'cause then he'll think
I'm skimming or something.

38:18.004 --> 38:20.214
This one time I'm not
gonna tell Franc, okay?

38:20.214 --> 38:21.716
Happens again, you're on your own.

38:21.716 --> 38:25.303
I'm gonna get you one of those
little counting thingies. A hibiscus.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.804
You mean abacus?

38:30.224 --> 38:31.767
Maybe you want to drink

38:31.767 --> 38:33.769
because something
doesn't sit well with you.

38:33.769 --> 38:36.147
Your cousin, what happened that day.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.858
Yeah, I mean,
I try to keep a handle on it, you know?

38:39.442 --> 38:42.194
Well, maybe you should open up about it,
be vulnerable.

38:42.194 --> 38:43.362
It's attractive.

38:43.362 --> 38:47.867
Yeah, but it's not like a bartering chip
that I use to pick up chicks with. It's...

38:47.867 --> 38:50.870
You know, that was like
the beginning of World War III for us.

38:50.870 --> 38:52.496
Yeah. Okay.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.040
That is unattractive.

38:55.416 --> 38:56.625
What?

38:56.625 --> 39:01.547
Well, the part where you go
from how you feel to World War III.

39:03.883 --> 39:07.136
But that, that is how I feel.

39:07.136 --> 39:09.680
Well, you know, 9/11 was a tragedy.

39:09.680 --> 39:12.308
To most of the world, it was a tragedy.

39:12.308 --> 39:15.644
But to Americans, it was the beginning
of the end of the world.

39:15.644 --> 39:18.022
What's your point?

39:18.022 --> 39:21.442
Well, you know,
France warned the U.S. government

39:21.442 --> 39:23.611
because of their experience with Algeria.

39:24.445 --> 39:27.406
And then told them
that maybe this was not a good idea.

39:28.324 --> 39:30.951
And they didn't want
to send their people to die.

39:31.869 --> 39:35.706
Listen, I, I don't get why
you want to do a book about 9/11

39:36.499 --> 39:38.334
if this is your take on America.

39:38.334 --> 39:40.628
Because it's an amazing story.

39:40.628 --> 39:44.590
It's a story about
how so many people in the world

39:44.590 --> 39:47.093
came to support America and its people.

39:47.093 --> 39:50.304
To say, "Hey, you know what?
You've done so much to help us

39:50.304 --> 39:53.641
"and to support us,
we want to give back to you."

39:53.641 --> 39:56.519
But what did your government do
with all that goodwill?

39:57.770 --> 39:59.355
Hell, you went right back to war.

39:59.355 --> 40:01.357
You started two new wars.

40:01.357 --> 40:03.776
In the name of what? Revenge?

40:06.320 --> 40:07.613
All right, hang on.

40:10.449 --> 40:15.746
First of all, I don't know shit
about no Algerians, okay?

40:16.914 --> 40:20.584
Second of all, yeah, I wanted revenge.

40:21.585 --> 40:22.878
I wanted revenge for my cousin.

40:22.878 --> 40:24.588
I wanted revenge for my country.

40:24.588 --> 40:27.675
I wanted revenge
for the 50 other guys I knew that day

40:27.675 --> 40:29.593
that got buried under that shit.

40:29.593 --> 40:30.928
How am I supposed to feel?

40:30.928 --> 40:33.305
I wanted blood.
I wanted it in, like, a week.

40:33.305 --> 40:36.016
So, I'll be honest with you,

40:36.016 --> 40:39.854
I basically feel the same right now.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.567
So shoot me.

40:46.152 --> 40:50.281
Every goddamn war is about revenge.

40:51.699 --> 40:53.659
And the French don't believe in guns.

40:55.244 --> 40:57.913
No. Or soap.

40:59.665 --> 41:01.250
Great cliché.

41:07.548 --> 41:08.591
Bitch.
