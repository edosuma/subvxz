WEBVTT

00:13.080 --> 00:15.440
-I found it in the wardrobe at home.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.440
-Mmm-hmm. -Must have been DI Hume's.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.840
-Hmm.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.000
Why don't you do all the red bits first?

00:21.200 --> 00:23.360
Do you know how wrong that statement is?

00:23.400 --> 00:25.200
You start at the corners, then the edges,

00:25.240 --> 00:26.360
then the middle.

00:26.400 --> 00:27.600
Just like a case.

00:29.600 --> 00:32.080
The drunk and disorderly from last night. Minor assault.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.720
Didn't he like your cooking?

00:35.760 --> 00:37.080
Says he wants to go home.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.960
And his wife's been calling every 10 minutes.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.160
Then tell her to keep a tighter rein on him.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.600
It's my husband.

00:50.560 --> 00:52.360
He's dead.

00:53.560 --> 00:54.600
I shot him.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.560
It's okay, it's okay. You don't have to come.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.000
Look. Here.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.880
Will you get her

01:44.960 --> 01:46.880
a drink of water?

01:55.880 --> 01:58.120
-Yeah.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.360
There's no one here.

02:38.240 --> 02:41.720
A woman confesses to murder and there's no body, no blood.

02:41.760 --> 02:45.000
More than that, the entire site

02:41.760 --> 02:45.000
looks like it's been cleansed.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.280
The tide could have cleaned the blood from the sand,

02:47.320 --> 02:49.200
maybe took the body, too.

02:49.240 --> 02:50.440
Call the coast guard.

02:50.480 --> 02:52.120
I want a sweep of this entire coastline.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.560
In this heat, he'll bloat and

02:52.160 --> 02:54.560
float pretty quickly.

02:57.880 --> 03:01.520
I know it's tough, Megan, but I need you to tell me

02:57.880 --> 03:01.520
exactly what happened.

03:01.560 --> 03:03.600
MEGAN:<i> Lucas just stormed off.</i>

03:03.640 --> 03:07.040
<i>I tried to stop him, but when</i> <i>I caught up, he went for me.</i>

03:08.840 --> 03:12.320
<i>I grabbed something</i> <i>to protect myself.</i>

03:08.840 --> 03:12.320
<i>I think it was a rock.</i>

03:12.360 --> 03:14.440
<i>When he fell,</i> <i>I saw a gun in the sand.</i>

03:14.480 --> 03:17.720
<i>I think that's what he must</i> <i>have hit me with.</i>

03:17.760 --> 03:20.880
You haven't got the guts. Look at you.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.280
Little mousy Megan.

03:23.320 --> 03:25.080
If people only knew!

03:25.120 --> 03:28.160
That gun's not even...

03:28.200 --> 03:30.520
RICHARD: <i>So,</i>

03:28.200 --> 03:30.520
<i>what did you do with the gun?</i>

03:30.560 --> 03:33.080
MEGAN:<i> I dropped it</i> <i>in the sand beside him.</i>

03:35.400 --> 03:38.560
Was it unusual for him to be violent

03:35.400 --> 03:38.560
towards you in that way?

03:42.120 --> 03:43.920
Um, here. Sorry.

03:45.480 --> 03:46.600
Thank you.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.400
-I don't know.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.400
-No.

03:55.880 --> 03:57.840
What's going to happen to me?

03:57.880 --> 03:59.680
-Well, I... -I'm so frightened.

04:04.320 --> 04:07.120
If you shot someone, why didn't you

04:04.320 --> 04:07.120
report it right away?

04:07.160 --> 04:10.360
I don't know, I was scared. Um, I just walked.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.560
She was probably in shock.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.720
-With friends.

04:14.760 --> 04:17.080
They have a house here.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.480
We came over to celebrate their anniversary.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.680
It happened as I told you, I swear.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.400
Come on. Come on.

04:33.080 --> 04:36.200
Okay, Mr Knight. You're being

04:33.080 --> 04:36.200
released without charge.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.160
But now that you've been cautioned,

04:38.200 --> 04:40.520
should you commit any similar offence

04:38.200 --> 04:40.520
whilst on the island,

04:40.560 --> 04:42.040
it will be taken into account, okay?

04:42.080 --> 04:45.080
I didn't commit any bloody offence.

04:45.120 --> 04:47.600
You know, we could always put you back in the cell.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.080
How do I get out of here?

04:54.480 --> 04:55.680
This way.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.320
RICHARD: She doesn't look like a killer.

05:01.360 --> 05:02.720
CAMILLE:  Too pretty?

05:02.760 --> 05:04.280
No, she just seems so... innocent.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.000
Apart from just confessing to murdering her husband?

05:10.040 --> 05:11.960
You know what I think?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.640
Someone spiked her drink,

05:13.680 --> 05:16.240
she had a bad dream, woke up and thinks it's real.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.200
And her injuries?

05:18.240 --> 05:20.680
Okay, so she had too many cocktails, fell over,

05:20.720 --> 05:22.880
cracked her head and went a bit mental.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.360
Super.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.920
I look forward to bringing the Commissioner up to speed.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.280
Hmm. "We had a woman confess to murdering her husband

05:29.320 --> 05:31.600
"and after an exhaustive investigation,

05:31.640 --> 05:35.360
"we are of the considered opinion that

05:31.640 --> 05:35.360
she 'went a bit mental'."

05:35.400 --> 05:36.920
-Thank you, Dwayne.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.680
Go and take care of Mrs Talbot.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.800
You're being very...considerate,

05:42.840 --> 05:44.480
bearing in mind she just committed a murder.

05:44.520 --> 05:47.520
Ah, but we haven't established that.

05:47.560 --> 05:50.480
I mean, it's hard to confirm the murder has even taken

05:47.560 --> 05:50.480
place without a body.

05:50.520 --> 05:51.720
Wow.

05:51.760 --> 05:54.080
You like her, don't you? -Oh, nonsense.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.440
-Oh.

05:56.480 --> 06:00.200
English, softly spoken. I bet she's just your type.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.960
That's not strictly true.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.920
You were holding hands.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.200
-Yeah, you.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.160
She...

06:08.200 --> 06:10.200
We weren't holding hands. She was holding my hand.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.000
Mmm-hmm.

06:12.040 --> 06:15.520
You'd like her to be innocent, so you can run

06:12.040 --> 06:15.520
barefoot across the sand

06:15.560 --> 06:17.520
and make wild love in the surf.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.160
Not only is that inaccurate, Camille,

06:19.200 --> 06:21.480
it's also childish, fanciful

06:21.520 --> 06:23.360
and unhygienic.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.520
You'll need to do a full written

06:29.000 --> 06:31.520
statement under caution.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.280
Of course. Whatever you say.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.600
Don't worry. We'll explain everything

06:33.320 --> 06:35.600
fully as we go along.

06:35.640 --> 06:36.760
Camille?

06:38.760 --> 06:40.720
Would you take Mrs Talbot through, please?

06:41.760 --> 06:43.480
Yes, sir.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.080
So, what happened?

06:45.120 --> 06:47.040
Crazy woman. Went all the way

06:45.120 --> 06:47.040
there and nothing.

06:47.080 --> 06:50.040
No body, no nothing.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.600
-I need you to go back to the beach.

06:52.640 --> 06:55.240
If there was a gun, the tide wouldn't be able to carry

06:52.640 --> 06:55.240
it out, would it?

06:55.280 --> 06:58.440
I mean, a body maybe, it would float.

06:55.280 --> 06:58.440
But a gun's too heavy.

06:58.480 --> 07:01.920
If the tide dragged it, it would just get stuck in the

06:58.480 --> 07:01.920
sand. Correct?

07:01.960 --> 07:03.400
-I guess so. -Yeah.

07:03.440 --> 07:04.960
Take a metal detector.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.880
Concentrate on the area where Mrs Talbot said the body was.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.120
Yes, sir.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.200
What happens now?

07:14.240 --> 07:17.280
Well, I have given it some thought

07:14.240 --> 07:17.280
and without a body,

07:17.320 --> 07:20.000
it's difficult to simply take this

07:17.320 --> 07:20.000
statement at face value.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.880
So, I think it'll be fine for you to go

07:20.040 --> 07:22.880
back to your villa

07:22.920 --> 07:24.880
and we'll carry on with our investigation.

07:24.920 --> 07:28.120
Uh, mmm. But you must surrender your passport.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.160
-It's just a formality. -I understand.

07:33.040 --> 07:34.360
Thank you.

07:35.640 --> 07:37.720
Yes, thank you. Now...

07:38.560 --> 07:40.200
Right. Let's get you home.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.280
Megan, where on earth have you been?

08:28.960 --> 08:30.080
And where's Lucas?

08:32.360 --> 08:34.240
Mrs Knight?

08:34.280 --> 08:35.760
Detective Inspector Richard Poole

08:35.800 --> 08:38.920
and Detective Sergeant Camille Bordey,

08:35.800 --> 08:38.920
Honore Police.

08:38.960 --> 08:41.520
-Of course.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.680
Patrick, darling? It's the police.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.400
Patrick?

08:57.480 --> 08:58.600
What's happened?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.640
ASTRID: Oh, my God! That's awful.

09:21.680 --> 09:24.000
Can I ask when you last saw Mr Talbot?

09:24.040 --> 09:25.520
It was last night.

09:25.560 --> 09:29.160
We were supposed to have dinner together at Pierre's.

09:29.200 --> 09:32.080
Lucas arrived very late and very drunk.

09:32.120 --> 09:34.480
He caused a scene. I had to take him outside.

09:34.520 --> 09:36.920
And he and Megan were arguing and he strode off

09:36.960 --> 09:38.360
and she went after him.

09:38.400 --> 09:41.000
And you didn't see either Mr or Mrs Talbot again?

09:41.040 --> 09:43.120
No, I came straight home.

09:44.560 --> 09:46.080
Is that a rain tree?

09:48.320 --> 09:49.720
Yes, it is.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.320
Don't see many of those over here, do you?

09:51.360 --> 09:53.880
It's all palms and coconuts but...

09:53.920 --> 09:56.000
Wow! Look at that.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.640
Magnificent specimen.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.120
Ah, that's made my day.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.320
So, what about you, Mr Knight?

10:04.360 --> 10:06.560
Did you see Mr or Mrs Talbot again?

10:06.600 --> 10:08.560
PATRICK: Of course I didn't, I was arrested.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.560
Excuse me?

10:10.600 --> 10:12.600
Do you lot actually talk to each other?

10:12.640 --> 10:15.480
I took Lucas out of the restaurant to stop him

10:12.640 --> 10:15.480
trashing the place.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.400
One of your officers saw me punching him,

10:17.440 --> 10:20.560
got the wrong end of the stick and arrested me.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.600
I spent the night in your cells.

10:22.640 --> 10:24.560
I see. Right.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.800
Well, there you are.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.920
Megan doesn't want to stay here.

10:42.840 --> 10:45.320
-Gregory. -Morning, Dwayne.

10:46.520 --> 10:49.040
How's it going?

10:49.080 --> 10:51.280
-Half an hour.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.800
Looks like you've been here all night.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.480
No way! I just parked up.

10:57.520 --> 10:59.600
I was just going to do some fishing,

10:57.520 --> 10:59.600
that's all.

10:59.640 --> 11:01.440
Hmm.

11:01.480 --> 11:04.840
You see any tourists on the beach

11:01.480 --> 11:04.840
last night

11:04.880 --> 11:08.120
No, like I said. I wasn't here last night.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.640
I hear what you're saying.

11:11.760 --> 11:15.400
But in 20 years, I have never heard

11:11.760 --> 11:15.400
the truth pass your lips.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.800
Come on. Out of the truck.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.720
Open it up.

11:32.840 --> 11:34.440
I'll find a place in town.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.000
I know you don't want me here. Not really.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.920
You don't have to go.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.920
She's got a mind of her own, Patrick.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.920
She can do as she pleases.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.920
Is it true

11:45.360 --> 11:48.400
Lucas hurt me. Not just last night.

11:48.440 --> 11:50.680
I know you don't want to believe it,

11:48.440 --> 11:50.680
but it's true.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.400
-Lucas had his problems. -He hit me, Astrid.

11:53.440 --> 11:55.680
You're a sensitive soul.

11:55.720 --> 11:57.520
You feel things other people would shrug off.

11:57.560 --> 11:58.880
Like this?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.160
Or this?

12:03.680 --> 12:05.040
I want to go now.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.360
All right, one thing. Do either of you own a gun?

12:17.040 --> 12:18.520
Of course we don't.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.160
No, no.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.360
No. Nope, thank you.

12:38.480 --> 12:41.720
Room 25, in case you want to visit.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.800
I know what you're doing and it won't work.

12:43.840 --> 12:46.080
And what is that?

12:46.120 --> 12:48.960
These insinuations about Mrs Talbot.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.920
Oh, you don't think she's pretty?

12:55.320 --> 12:57.600
Neither. I'm a police officer, she's a potential suspect.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.520
It would be inappropriate to have an opinion.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.400
So now she's only a potential suspect?

13:01.440 --> 13:04.160
-Yeah. -Despite us having

13:01.440 --> 13:04.160
a full confession?

13:04.200 --> 13:07.120
No, I believe she told us honestly what she thinks

13:04.200 --> 13:07.120
happened but...

13:07.160 --> 13:08.880
There's blood on her dress.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.360
She admitted her husband had been

13:08.920 --> 13:11.360
violent towards her before,

13:11.400 --> 13:12.840
that she feared for her life.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.600
We haven't found a body.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.080
That doesn't make her innocent.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.120
It doesn't make her guilty, either.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.000
So, you don't believe she murdered her husband?

13:27.280 --> 13:29.960
Yeah, I think that's very likely

13:27.280 --> 13:29.960
but to be sure,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.720
to be absolutely sure, we need a body.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.320
DWAYNE:  <i>Come in, car one.</i>

13:40.160 --> 13:42.400
-Go ahead, Dwayne. <i>-We found the body.</i>

13:53.200 --> 13:56.320
Got caught up in the props of a fishing boat

13:53.200 --> 13:56.320
on its way back in.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.880
RICHARD: So you think cause of death

14:06.960 --> 14:08.880
was the gunshot wound?

14:09.840 --> 14:11.240
Much obliged.

14:11.280 --> 14:12.480
CORONER: Bye.

14:15.240 --> 14:18.120
-Shot in the head.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.600
Must have been dead before he hit the ground.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.960
She said she shot twice.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.080
Yeah, unlikely they're both head.

14:27.120 --> 14:30.040
-He has other injuries. -Hmm.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.440
Probably propeller contact. The coroner can confirm.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.360
Look, his stopwatch is running.

14:35.400 --> 14:36.640
Really?

14:39.200 --> 14:41.360
CAMILLE: One hour twenty-three minutes.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.760
Hmm.

14:44.760 --> 14:45.800
CAMILLE: Huh!

14:47.280 --> 14:49.080
Hello. Where did that come from?

14:49.120 --> 14:50.720
Caught behind the watch.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.200
Doesn't match his jacket.

14:55.440 --> 14:56.480
Hang on.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.120
RICHARD: Fidel

15:01.160 --> 15:03.920
Take this phone and put it in a large bag

15:03.960 --> 15:05.400
and fill it with rice.

15:05.440 --> 15:07.200
-Yeah,

15:05.440 --> 15:07.200
make sure it's well-covered.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.680
It'll soak up the moisture.

15:08.720 --> 15:11.480
-And do not turn it on. -Sir.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.760
Looks like it happened just as she said.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.280
She shot him in the head, the tide took him out.

15:23.480 --> 15:25.400
You want me to do it?

15:25.440 --> 15:26.880
No. I'll do it.

15:28.280 --> 15:29.440
Fidel.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.480
Hello.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.680
Megan Talbot, I'm arresting you on suspicion of

15:51.000 --> 15:54.680
the murder of Lucas Talbot.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.960
You do not have to say anything

15:54.720 --> 15:56.960
but it might harm your defence

15:57.000 --> 16:00.160
if you do not mention, when questioned, something you

15:57.000 --> 16:00.160
later rely on in court.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.920
Anything you do say may be given as evidence.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.080
Do you understand?

16:08.560 --> 16:11.480
I've got the best duty solicitor

16:08.560 --> 16:11.480
on the island on her way.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.680
They're here to make things easier.

16:15.720 --> 16:17.760
This man hurt you.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.160
I think you have every right to claim self-defence.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.520
Oh, um...

16:23.560 --> 16:25.200
Can I just ask one last thing?

16:26.840 --> 16:29.600
Have you ever seen this before?

16:29.640 --> 16:32.240
From an item of yours or your husband's clothing,

16:29.640 --> 16:32.240
perhaps?

16:32.280 --> 16:33.400
I don't think so.

16:34.440 --> 16:35.480
No.

16:45.520 --> 16:46.640
Leave it.

16:50.280 --> 16:51.840
You arrested Patrick Knight, didn't you?

16:51.880 --> 16:53.440
Yes, sir.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.800
The other man was on the floor.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.800
He was punching him.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.400
That must have been Lucas Talbot.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.880
I dragged him off, he resisted,

16:57.440 --> 16:59.880
so I handcuffed him.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.320
And Lucas Talbot?

17:01.360 --> 17:03.520
By the time I got Mr Knight in the car, he'd gone.

17:03.560 --> 17:04.880
Hmm.

17:04.920 --> 17:06.320
Does anyone know why they were arguing?

17:06.360 --> 17:07.760
No, sir.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.840
Look, I just don't understand why she can't

17:11.440 --> 17:14.840
explain any of this.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.840
The button could be flotsam.

17:16.880 --> 17:19.240
Yeah, but one button

17:19.280 --> 17:21.480
And the stopwatch, an hour and

17:19.280 --> 17:21.480
twenty-three minutes.

17:21.520 --> 17:24.120
We've got times and places. We've got blood on her dress.

17:24.160 --> 17:26.560
We've got a body and we've got a confession.

17:26.600 --> 17:28.360
All the pieces are there.

17:31.600 --> 17:32.800
Yes, they are.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.720
Do you think Megan Talbot shot her husband?

17:44.480 --> 17:46.880
-Yes. -Then it's over. Come on.

17:46.920 --> 17:49.280
I'll buy you a cup of tea.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.160
FIDEL: You know, life would be a lot easier

17:57.200 --> 17:58.880
if everyone just came in and confessed.

17:58.920 --> 18:01.160
-DWAYNE: True. -No struggling to find clues.

18:01.200 --> 18:04.840
-Interviewing witnesses. -Just an open and

18:01.200 --> 18:04.840
shut case every time.

18:04.880 --> 18:08.040
-I'll drink to that. Cheers! -Cheers!

18:15.200 --> 18:18.480
Look, if the body was taken out by the tide,

18:15.200 --> 18:18.480
where's the gun?

18:18.520 --> 18:20.840
Perhaps she lied. She could have

18:18.520 --> 18:20.840
thrown it into the sea.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.120
But why?

18:22.160 --> 18:23.640
I mean, if you come into

18:22.160 --> 18:23.640
a police station

18:23.680 --> 18:25.400
confessing to murdering your husband,

18:25.440 --> 18:27.520
why lie about what you did with the gun?

18:25.440 --> 18:27.520
Doesn't make sense.

18:27.560 --> 18:29.880
Well, maybe she was confused, couldn't remember

18:27.560 --> 18:29.880
things properly.

18:29.920 --> 18:32.360
You said yourself she must have been in shock.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.800
Hmm. Hmm, it's possible.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.840
What about the button behind the watch?

18:36.400 --> 18:38.840
How does that fit in?

18:38.880 --> 18:41.240
And hey, something else that's really irritating...

18:41.280 --> 18:43.400
-Patrick Knight.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.560
Now, as I understand it, he was belligerent

18:46.600 --> 18:48.440
and complaining about his night in the cells.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.480
CAMILLE: So?

18:50.520 --> 18:52.160
So, when we went to the house

18:52.200 --> 18:54.360
and his wife called him to say that we were the police,

18:54.400 --> 18:55.840
you know what he said?

18:57.280 --> 18:58.640
"What's happened?"

18:59.920 --> 19:01.520
Look, come on. Think about it logically.

19:01.560 --> 19:04.200
If you'd been what you thought was

19:01.560 --> 19:04.200
wrongfully arrested,

19:04.240 --> 19:06.040
spent the night in the cells, then been released,

19:06.080 --> 19:08.200
and then the police turned up at the house,

19:08.240 --> 19:10.360
wouldn't you assume it was all connected?

19:10.400 --> 19:12.920
I mean, wouldn't your first reaction on hearing that

19:10.400 --> 19:12.920
the police were at the door

19:12.960 --> 19:14.680
be to, you know, I don't know,

19:14.720 --> 19:16.400
jump to conclusions

19:16.440 --> 19:19.080
and complain about police harassment

19:16.440 --> 19:19.080
or something, yeah?

19:19.120 --> 19:23.200
But he just said, "What's happened?"

19:23.240 --> 19:26.680
<i>Maman,</i> what would you say if the police

19:23.240 --> 19:26.680
came to your house?

19:26.720 --> 19:29.120
What's the first thing you would ask?

19:29.160 --> 19:31.000
What's happened?

19:31.040 --> 19:33.520
Yeah, okay. Now say you've just been

19:31.040 --> 19:33.520
released from the cells.

19:33.560 --> 19:35.760
What have I done?

19:38.440 --> 19:40.560
-You tell me.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.560
You're the policeman.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.880
Okay, you're guilty.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.120
Then why have you released me?

19:47.160 --> 19:48.640
Okay. Look.

19:48.680 --> 19:51.800
Forget it. Ignore his reaction if you want to.

19:51.840 --> 19:55.120
I'm clearly on my own here but no gun,

19:51.840 --> 19:55.120
the button, the stopwatch.

19:56.800 --> 19:59.880
They all mean something.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.480
Did we get any statements from the staff at

19:59.920 --> 20:02.480
the restaurant where they ate?

20:02.520 --> 20:04.560
I was going to do it this afternoon.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.360
-Let's do it now. -But we just got here.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.680
Look, even if Mrs Talbot's guilty

20:06.400 --> 20:09.680
and her confession is true,

20:09.720 --> 20:11.640
that's no excuse for shoddy police work.

20:11.680 --> 20:14.200
We still need to provide all the necessary evidence

20:11.680 --> 20:14.200
for the prosecution.

20:14.240 --> 20:17.200
-Or the defence. -Mmm. That, too.

20:17.240 --> 20:19.400
Dwayne, Mrs Knight said that Lucas Talbot

20:19.440 --> 20:22.120
was very late for dinner and very drunk. Find out where

20:19.440 --> 20:22.120
he was drinking.

20:22.160 --> 20:23.800
And Fidel, check with the UK.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.120
Find out what you can about Astrid and Patrick Knight.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.200
-And the victim, too. -Yes, sir.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.760
Come on. Chop chop!

20:37.440 --> 20:39.960
Pierre is the best seafood chef

20:37.440 --> 20:39.960
on the island.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.280
Yeah. I'm not a big fan of seafood,

20:40.000 --> 20:42.280
if I'm honest.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.880
Most of it has eyes.

20:43.920 --> 20:46.760
Bit disconcerting to eat something while it's

20:43.920 --> 20:46.760
staring back at you.

20:46.800 --> 20:49.200
Hey, Camille. Good to see you.

20:49.240 --> 20:52.280
-We got some beautiful lobster in today.

20:49.240 --> 20:52.280
-Mr, um...

20:53.360 --> 20:55.240
Pierre.

20:55.280 --> 20:58.120
I gather you had a party of four in here last night,

20:55.280 --> 20:58.120
name of Knight?

20:58.160 --> 21:00.200
Several weeks on the island of Sainte-Marie

21:00.240 --> 21:01.880
and this is your first time in here?

21:01.920 --> 21:05.200
Am I right, Mr UK policeman?

21:05.240 --> 21:09.280
That's correct. Though I have really, really been meaning

21:05.240 --> 21:09.280
to sample your menu.

21:09.320 --> 21:10.960
What stopped you?

21:11.000 --> 21:13.520
Murders, mainly. They wreak havoc

21:11.000 --> 21:13.520
with the appetite.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.520
I see. You're not going to help

21:17.480 --> 21:19.520
because I haven't eaten here.

21:19.560 --> 21:23.120
-I think what

21:19.560 --> 21:23.120
the Inspector means is

21:23.160 --> 21:25.200
he'd love to try the Pierre Platter.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.640
-Do I really have to go

21:26.680 --> 21:29.000
through this charade to get police work done?

21:29.040 --> 21:30.160
Yes.

21:32.760 --> 21:35.000
I would love to try the Pierre Platter.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.920
Mr and Mrs Knight were here last night.

21:41.080 --> 21:44.120
-Yes. That sounds like her.

21:44.160 --> 21:48.200
Then the other man came in drunk, right after 9:00,

21:44.160 --> 21:48.200
started shouting.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.600
He was very abusive, so Mr Knight took him outside.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.160
And that was it?

21:52.200 --> 21:53.840
Well, there was a lot of shouting

21:52.200 --> 21:53.840
in the car park,

21:53.880 --> 21:57.440
so one of my staff called the police.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.680
Why don't you see it for yourself

21:57.480 --> 21:59.680
while I prepare your lunch?

21:59.720 --> 22:01.800
-We have it on security camera.

21:59.720 --> 22:01.800
-Oh.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.640
Oh, that's him.

22:12.160 --> 22:14.040
Ah! Wish I knew what they were saying.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.040
It's there on the body language.

22:16.080 --> 22:20.200
Yeah, but I don't speak body language.

22:16.080 --> 22:20.200
I only did Latin and Mandarin.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.480
Lucas Talbot is angry.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.040
He wants to go back inside.

22:37.480 --> 22:40.600
So, we don't really know who he was angry with.

22:40.640 --> 22:41.920
His wife.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.400
Why?

22:43.440 --> 22:45.080
Because he was trying to get back in the restaurant.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.840
-Mr Knight was stopping him doing so.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.840
-Hmm.

22:48.880 --> 22:51.440
-Ooh! -Good grief.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.680
PIERRE: So, how is the food?

22:58.880 --> 23:00.680
I feel like Poseidon himself.

23:01.960 --> 23:04.560
Tell me, do you recognise

23:04.600 --> 23:05.800
this button?

23:09.560 --> 23:11.160
No.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.160
Really? There's nothing in the restaurant it

23:11.200 --> 23:13.160
could have come from?

23:13.200 --> 23:15.000
I'm sorry, no.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.000
Never mind.

23:17.040 --> 23:19.480
-Thank you. -Now, please enjoy.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.880
Thank you.

23:21.920 --> 23:23.320
-Ah, Pierre. -Dwayne.

23:25.280 --> 23:26.760
Smells good.

23:27.680 --> 23:28.720
So?

23:30.480 --> 23:34.200
Well, it seems like Lucas Talbot

23:30.480 --> 23:34.200
drank in every bar in Honore

23:34.240 --> 23:36.160
before he got here last night.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.480
He must have been steaming.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.200
I talked to people who saw him drinking

23:39.240 --> 23:40.640
and from what I can make out,

23:40.680 --> 23:43.280
he just sat on his own texting on his mobile phone.

23:43.320 --> 23:45.800
He left the last bar in the harbour about 9:00.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.840
That fits with the time he arrived here.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.440
Ah, these were calling me all along the street.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.400
Okay, so.

23:52.440 --> 23:54.640
I ran all three names through the computer,

23:54.680 --> 23:56.160
Lucas Talbot first.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.680
He has three previous arrests on suspicion of assault,

23:58.720 --> 24:01.360
all reported by women he was in a relationship with.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.560
His company, which organised

24:01.400 --> 24:03.560
VIP social events,

24:03.600 --> 24:05.400
went into liquidation last month.

24:05.440 --> 24:07.240
There wasn't much on Patrick and Astrid Knight.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.760
No convictions. Nothing so much

24:07.280 --> 24:09.760
as a parking fine.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.440
Mmm-hmm.

24:13.480 --> 24:16.040
It looks like Mrs Knight already had all the money

24:13.480 --> 24:16.040
when they got married.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.520
I pulled these off the internet.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.120
She runs a celebrity PR company

24:19.160 --> 24:22.320
specialising in protecting high-profile

24:19.160 --> 24:22.320
clients from the press.

24:22.360 --> 24:25.440
When they get themselves in trouble, she's the first

24:22.360 --> 24:25.440
person they call.

24:25.480 --> 24:27.520
-He was

24:25.480 --> 24:27.520
a journalist when they met, but he's just started his

24:27.560 --> 24:29.600
own management company.

24:29.640 --> 24:32.120
So, it seems like he's trying to even things up.

24:32.160 --> 24:34.560
Okay, good.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.240
So, Astrid and Patrick Knight protect reputations

24:37.280 --> 24:40.440
and cover up improprieties.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.040
I wonder what they'd do if someone came to them

24:42.080 --> 24:45.000
saying they'd just murdered their husband?

24:45.040 --> 24:48.320
I am still not sure why we're back here.

24:48.360 --> 24:51.720
Because we may have a body and a confession,

24:51.760 --> 24:53.040
yes, I'm prepared to accept that

24:53.080 --> 24:54.840
Megan Talbot may very well be the killer,

24:54.880 --> 24:56.880
but what we don't have is the truth.

24:56.920 --> 24:58.520
I'm certain of it.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.960
Truth that will, at the very least,

24:58.560 --> 25:00.960
explain the button,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.440
the stopwatch set at an hour and

25:01.000 --> 25:03.440
twenty-three minutes,

25:03.480 --> 25:05.640
and what happened to the gun.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.840
-And you think that they know something

25:07.880 --> 25:09.600
-Yes, I do.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.480
Okay, what's the plan?

25:12.520 --> 25:15.560
I don't have one. Mrs Knight.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.360
I wonder if we might ask you a few more questions?

25:19.760 --> 25:20.960
Megan left some things.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.160
I've boxed them up in case they're needed.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.480
-How very efficient of you. -I try.

25:25.520 --> 25:27.600
RICHARD: Though efficiency must be

25:25.520 --> 25:27.600
second nature to you

25:27.640 --> 25:29.520
in your line of work.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.680
Public relations, isn't it?

25:31.720 --> 25:33.360
You've been doing your homework, Inspector.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.840
Second nature to me, I'm afraid.

25:35.880 --> 25:37.480
I just lost a very dear friend

25:37.520 --> 25:39.280
and his wife has confessed to his murder.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.240
I've found that keeping busy helps keep my mind off that.

25:41.280 --> 25:42.880
Of course.

25:42.920 --> 25:45.640
Though I have to admit, I do find it intriguing.

25:45.680 --> 25:47.440
What is?

25:47.480 --> 25:49.880
Well, should Mrs Talbot have contacted you,

25:49.920 --> 25:53.760
how you might have advised her in your professional capacity?

25:53.800 --> 25:55.160
Are you suggesting that's what happened?

25:55.200 --> 25:56.640
You tell me.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.680
I'm very good at what I do.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.000
-I'm sure you are. -So,

26:01.040 --> 26:03.200
if someone came and told me they'd murdered their husband

26:03.240 --> 26:06.800
I very much doubt my advice would be to go and confess

26:03.240 --> 26:06.800
all to the police.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.720
Can I get you some tea?

26:11.760 --> 26:13.600
That would be very nice. Thank you.

26:20.800 --> 26:24.080
That sounded very much like you were

26:20.800 --> 26:24.080
accusing my wife of something.

26:24.120 --> 26:26.000
Really?

26:26.040 --> 26:28.320
Terribly sorry. That wasn't my intention.

26:38.280 --> 26:39.960
What are you doing?

26:42.480 --> 26:44.400
Oh! You and that button!

26:44.960 --> 26:46.800
Right.

26:46.840 --> 26:49.680
-You keep them talking. -No, no, no, no.

26:49.720 --> 26:51.200
You keep them talking.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.680
I'll check the buttons.

27:11.240 --> 27:12.880
Your colleague has been a long time in the bathroom.

27:12.920 --> 27:14.920
-I'm sure she's fine. -Perhaps I should check.

27:14.960 --> 27:18.120
You know, this tea is a splendid colour.

27:18.160 --> 27:21.520
I'll be honest with you. I've had a lot of

27:18.160 --> 27:21.520
difficulty with tea.

27:21.560 --> 27:23.440
Honestly, I'm having real difficulty.

27:25.360 --> 27:27.320
Don't know what it is, you know?

27:27.360 --> 27:30.000
It just doesn't spank the palate as it should.

27:30.040 --> 27:32.320
Have you found that?

27:32.360 --> 27:34.040
I really think we should go and see

27:32.360 --> 27:34.040
if she's all right.

27:34.080 --> 27:36.320
As I say, an excellent colour.

27:36.360 --> 27:40.440
Sandy, gold. There are some nice oranges

27:36.360 --> 27:40.440
coming through there.

27:40.480 --> 27:41.520
Do you mind?

27:43.680 --> 27:45.080
Ooh!

27:47.440 --> 27:49.560
And the real clincher, of course,

27:50.640 --> 27:52.560
is the taste.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.920
Oh, ooh. No, that's awful.

27:55.960 --> 27:58.000
Sorry, um, oh, wait.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.000
What on earth are you doing?

28:07.160 --> 28:09.240
Is this not Mrs Talbot's room?

28:09.280 --> 28:12.000
No, it's not. And even if it was, you need permission

28:09.280 --> 28:12.000
to conduct a search.

28:12.040 --> 28:13.800
I know the law inside-out.

28:13.840 --> 28:15.640
You're right, we do.

28:17.640 --> 28:18.960
I must ask you to leave.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.120
Had you had the decency to ask,

28:27.160 --> 28:30.040
I'm sure we would have been happy to show you

28:27.160 --> 28:30.040
anything you wanted. Then, can I ask what you

28:30.080 --> 28:32.960
and Mr Talbot were arguing about

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
outside the restaurant last night?

28:36.040 --> 28:38.880
He was drunk. I was trying to

28:36.040 --> 28:38.880
convince him to go home.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.800
By punching him?

28:40.840 --> 28:43.000
It got out of hand.

28:43.040 --> 28:45.280
Mr Talbot had serious

28:43.040 --> 28:45.280
financial difficulties.

28:45.320 --> 28:46.480
Were you aware of them?

28:46.520 --> 28:49.000
-No. -Hmm.

28:49.040 --> 28:51.880
So, you were his friends, yet he didn't

28:49.040 --> 28:51.880
share his financial concerns?

28:51.920 --> 28:54.320
-Well... -Lucas was a very proud man.

28:54.360 --> 28:57.120
If he'd have asked, I'd have helped him.

28:54.360 --> 28:57.120
But he didn't.

28:57.160 --> 28:59.400
And may I ask why you're asking all these questions,

28:57.160 --> 28:59.400
Inspector?

28:59.440 --> 29:02.320
-It's as though we're under suspicion.

29:02.360 --> 29:04.280
Because we've already told you everything that we know

29:04.320 --> 29:07.120
-and yet here you are again. -It's my job.

29:07.160 --> 29:09.160
And you take it very seriously, don't you?

29:09.200 --> 29:12.000
Is that what the British police do with the nasty

29:09.200 --> 29:12.000
ones these days,

29:12.040 --> 29:13.480
post them overseas?

29:13.520 --> 29:15.800
Were you bit of a bully back in the UK?

29:18.280 --> 29:22.160
One thing I'm not, madam, is a bully.

29:22.200 --> 29:26.120
Well, then perhaps you'll leave us alone to grieve over

29:22.200 --> 29:26.120
our dear friend in peace.

29:32.160 --> 29:34.640
I wouldn't like to get the wrong side of her.

29:35.880 --> 29:38.120
The lady doth protest too much, methinks.

29:40.080 --> 29:42.800
Call Dwayne. Have him and

29:40.080 --> 29:42.800
Fidel watch the house.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.440
You're not going to eat that there, are you?

30:07.480 --> 30:10.000
Juliet made it for me.

30:10.040 --> 30:13.080
Slow-releasing carbs are what's needed

30:10.040 --> 30:13.080
for a long stakeout.

30:15.240 --> 30:19.160
I should've asked her to pack some

30:15.240 --> 30:19.160
doughnuts for afters.

30:19.200 --> 30:22.080
That's what you eat on a stakeout, isn't it?

30:19.200 --> 30:22.080
Doughnuts?

30:23.400 --> 30:24.640
Hmm.

30:26.360 --> 30:28.520
Yeah, all I've got is a yogurt.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.360
Not the same, really, is it?

30:32.200 --> 30:33.920
We could go and get some doughnuts, I suppose.

30:35.840 --> 30:38.840
I was joking. Forget the doughnuts.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.680
What if they move while we're gone?

30:42.720 --> 30:44.000
What?

30:48.160 --> 30:49.240
Oh.

30:55.880 --> 30:58.880
Oh, you know that Dwayne saw someone

30:55.880 --> 30:58.880
parked near the beach,

30:58.920 --> 31:02.120
-No.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.120
A local small-time thief called Greg Collins.

31:04.160 --> 31:07.480
So, I thought I might drive there on my way home,

31:07.520 --> 31:10.240
-see if anyone's parked there. -Be careful.

31:10.280 --> 31:12.640
I will. Goodnight, sir.

31:12.680 --> 31:13.800
Goodnight, Camille.

31:35.680 --> 31:38.560
-I don't know.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.160
She dumped something. Get sifting.

31:41.200 --> 31:44.840
I always have to go through the rubbish. Isn't it your

31:41.200 --> 31:44.840
turn to get stinky?

31:44.880 --> 31:47.160
Imagine if you find a gun or something.

31:47.200 --> 31:49.120
The Inspector will be really impressed.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.960
We've been through it all three times.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
No gun, nothing suspicious at all.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.480
Hello

33:01.680 --> 33:04.160
-Come and have a look at this.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.680
-Couple of bruises.

33:06.720 --> 33:08.800
It's my own fault. I should have

33:06.720 --> 33:08.800
called for backup.

33:08.840 --> 33:12.000
-No, but it was

33:08.840 --> 33:12.000
the same pickup truck.

33:12.040 --> 33:14.000
So, Dwayne is pretty sure it was Greg Collins.

33:14.040 --> 33:15.720
And he was in a hurry to leave.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.480
I found this by one of the holes.

33:17.520 --> 33:19.520
Well, if he was fishing, why would he run?

33:20.560 --> 33:22.680
Hmm, bubble wrap?

33:24.080 --> 33:26.240
Are the maggots especially fragile over here?

33:29.480 --> 33:30.640
What is it?

33:34.120 --> 33:35.600
Two stakeouts in one night.

33:37.120 --> 33:39.200
-Greg.

33:39.240 --> 33:41.120
Okay, I'll take the moneyman when he gets here.

33:41.160 --> 33:44.120
-I'll seize the merchandise. -Great, and I'll...

33:44.160 --> 33:45.360
I'll, um...

33:46.240 --> 33:48.120
-Backup.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.160
Backup? Great.

33:51.200 --> 33:54.400
-Okay, you do Greg, I'll do backup.

33:51.200 --> 33:54.400
-No, no, Greg's yours.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.840
Okay, get into positions.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.600
-Wait till he takes the cash. -Okay.

34:12.200 --> 34:14.320
Stop right there! Police!

34:14.360 --> 34:16.680
-Gregory, give it up.

34:16.720 --> 34:18.360
Give it away.

34:18.400 --> 34:21.120
Seriously, Dwayne, this is a big

34:18.400 --> 34:21.120
misunderstanding.

34:23.160 --> 34:24.960
Hawksbill turtle eggs.

34:27.840 --> 34:29.560
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

34:33.920 --> 34:38.240
Endangerment and theft of a protected species.

34:38.280 --> 34:40.520
Assault on a police officer.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.960
-Oh, that was an accident. -It's still assault.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.400
And with your history, should be good

34:43.000 --> 34:45.400
for what, three years?

34:45.440 --> 34:46.840
Easy.

34:46.880 --> 34:48.760
So what do you want?

34:48.800 --> 34:51.120
The beach where you assaulted Sergeant Bordey,

34:51.160 --> 34:52.960
there was a shooting there two nights ago.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.560
-We think you

34:53.000 --> 34:54.560
were parked there

34:56.160 --> 34:58.320
Sorry, I think you've got me mixed up with someone else.

34:58.360 --> 35:00.920
-No.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.760
Okay, fine, see you in three years.

35:03.280 --> 35:05.200
Okay, okay.

35:05.240 --> 35:08.480
I'll take the fine for the eggs,

35:05.240 --> 35:08.480
you drop the assault thing.

35:08.520 --> 35:09.880
What do we get in return?

35:11.280 --> 35:13.200
I think you were there,

35:13.240 --> 35:15.400
I think you saw a man and a woman pass you on their

35:13.240 --> 35:15.400
way to the beach.

35:15.440 --> 35:18.480
The question is did you see anyone else?

35:18.520 --> 35:20.440
No, there was no one else.

35:25.400 --> 35:28.400
-But I saw the woman.

35:29.600 --> 35:32.400
The one in the cell, shooting the guy.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.520
Lucas.

35:38.520 --> 35:41.320
<i>He went to pick her up</i> <i>and she clumped</i>

35:38.520 --> 35:41.320
<i>him with a rock.</i>

35:42.520 --> 35:44.040
<i></i>

35:47.040 --> 35:48.840
Shot him. Dead.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.600
Well, what did she do with the gun?

35:52.640 --> 35:54.640
I don't know, I legged it back to the van.

35:54.680 --> 35:56.480
And you didn't report this because...

35:56.520 --> 35:58.200
Well, it was my gun, wasn't it?

35:58.240 --> 36:02.680
I mean, I only use it for rats and rabbits but

35:58.240 --> 36:02.680
it was still mine.

36:02.720 --> 36:06.320
I went back in the morning to see if it was still there,

36:02.720 --> 36:06.320
but there was nothing.

36:06.360 --> 36:08.960
No gun, no body.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.800
That's when Dwayne moved me on.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.960
Autopsy report's in, Chief.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.480
Go on.

36:18.520 --> 36:22.560
Bullet to the head was fatal. Blood showed high

36:18.520 --> 36:22.560
levels of alcohol.

36:22.600 --> 36:26.320
Oh, and the other injury wasn't propeller damage.

36:26.360 --> 36:29.280
It was the second bullet. Bounced off his skull.

36:31.320 --> 36:33.680
Two shots, just like she said.

36:33.720 --> 36:35.600
We also know where the gun came from

36:35.640 --> 36:38.920
and now we've got an eyewitness to add

36:35.640 --> 36:38.920
to the confession.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.480
No.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.720
-Cheers! -Cheers!

36:52.680 --> 36:55.040
Okay, so the button was just flotsam from the water.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.800
-Okay. -The gun is in

36:55.080 --> 36:57.800
the sea somewhere.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.440
-Yeah, maybe. -And

36:57.840 --> 37:00.440
the stopwatch was unrelated.

37:00.480 --> 37:02.560
-Yeah. -So no more mystery.

37:03.600 --> 37:06.040
-No. -And, uh...

37:06.080 --> 37:08.160
-Camille.

37:08.200 --> 37:11.160
Twenty years, it's a long time. I mean, you're a man,

37:08.200 --> 37:11.160
you've got needs.

37:11.200 --> 37:13.160
She'll understand, I'm sure.

37:17.560 --> 37:19.560
Who's the best marksman out of you three?

37:21.880 --> 37:25.360
Okay, if Greg Collins' statement is right,

37:25.400 --> 37:30.600
Megan was around 12 feet from Lucas Talbot

37:25.400 --> 37:30.600
when she shot him.

37:32.440 --> 37:34.160
Hmm?

37:34.200 --> 37:37.120
In your own time, two shots hit less than

37:34.200 --> 37:37.120
two inches apart.

37:38.160 --> 37:39.400
Easy.

37:47.600 --> 37:50.200
-Good. -Yeah.

37:52.320 --> 37:55.520
In Megan's statement, she had both her

37:52.320 --> 37:55.520
eyes tightly shut.

37:55.560 --> 37:59.640
Her hands were shaking, too, but we'll ignore that

37:55.560 --> 37:59.640
for the time being.

37:59.680 --> 38:00.800
When you're ready!

38:10.560 --> 38:11.840
Strange.

38:13.320 --> 38:16.360
Megan Talbot, despite never having

38:13.320 --> 38:16.360
fired a gun before,

38:16.400 --> 38:20.480
having both eyes shut and hands shaking,

38:16.400 --> 38:20.480
fired two shots

38:20.520 --> 38:23.720
which hit inches apart from the same distance.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.360
Dwayne, are we missing something?

38:25.400 --> 38:29.400
Was Mrs Talbot a Navy SEAL or an MI5 agent?

38:29.440 --> 38:32.080
-No, Chief. -I thought not.

38:45.240 --> 38:47.080
Anyone know where this leads?

38:47.120 --> 38:50.160
It's a hiking trail into the woods. I don't think

38:47.120 --> 38:50.160
it goes anywhere.

38:51.760 --> 38:54.080
Follow it for a bit, see what you find on the way.

39:07.640 --> 39:09.480
If people only knew!

39:09.520 --> 39:10.560
What's happened?

39:40.120 --> 39:41.200
Hmm. Ah!

39:47.600 --> 39:49.400
Now, okay.

39:51.920 --> 39:53.360
What is it?

39:53.400 --> 39:57.240
Why is the most obvious thing always the hardest to see?

39:57.640 --> 39:59.320
What?

39:59.360 --> 40:01.400
<i> Dwayne, come in.</i>

39:59.360 --> 40:01.400
-I'm here. Go ahead.

40:01.440 --> 40:03.520
Yeah, tell the Chief I found where the trail leads.

40:03.560 --> 40:05.520
He'll never guess.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.520
FIDEL:<i> Okay, then, well, he</i> <i>probably knows they're</i>

40:11.200 --> 40:13.520
<i>getting ready to leave.</i>

40:15.800 --> 40:17.160
Put her in the car.

40:19.120 --> 40:21.360
Tell Fidel to meet us at the house.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.640
And I need you to go and collect something.

40:23.680 --> 40:25.560
<i>-Yes, Dwayne.</i>

40:25.600 --> 40:27.920
-Not exactly.

40:27.960 --> 40:30.400
But you know why? -Not fully.

40:33.560 --> 40:35.760
Oh, yeah. I know how.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Well, partly.

40:45.080 --> 40:46.920
-Come on. -I'm coming.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.160
What did you put in this?

40:48.200 --> 40:50.360
Oh, for God's sake, stop fannying about

40:50.400 --> 40:52.280
and just put them in the car.

41:11.880 --> 41:13.720
Excuse me, can I help you?

41:13.760 --> 41:15.000
Excuse me!

41:20.280 --> 41:23.040
-I'm starting at the corners.

41:24.640 --> 41:27.200
Richard. Richard.

41:28.600 --> 41:30.760
Richard!

41:30.800 --> 41:33.000
Of course! Of course, of course, of course.

41:33.040 --> 41:35.040
Of course what?

41:35.080 --> 41:37.320
We've been advised by our lawyers to ask you to

41:35.080 --> 41:37.320
leave the premises.

41:38.080 --> 41:40.680
We won't be long.

41:40.720 --> 41:43.200
Just need a few minutes of your time.

41:47.760 --> 41:49.200
Why is she here?

41:50.320 --> 41:52.120
Excellent question.

41:52.160 --> 41:54.600
Mr Knight, would you mind passing that

41:52.160 --> 41:54.600
phone to Mrs Talbot?

42:01.560 --> 42:04.400
MEGAN: It's mine. I lost it a few days ago.

42:04.440 --> 42:05.960
RICHARD: The day you shot your husband?

42:06.000 --> 42:07.160
Yes.

42:07.200 --> 42:09.560
RICHARD: May I?

42:09.600 --> 42:13.960
We found it on the victim's body after we pulled

42:09.600 --> 42:13.960
him out of the sea.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.520
So we of course assumed it was his

42:16.560 --> 42:18.360
but once we could turn it on, we saw that the screensaver

42:18.400 --> 42:21.200
was in fact a photograph of Mr Talbot.

42:21.240 --> 42:24.240
Which, unless he's extremely vain,

42:24.280 --> 42:27.520
made it much more likely the phone

42:24.280 --> 42:27.520
belonged to his wife.

42:27.560 --> 42:29.840
But why would he have his wife's phone?

42:32.040 --> 42:35.040
You know, I usually enjoy

42:32.040 --> 42:35.040
this part, but, um,

42:36.520 --> 42:38.560
I have to confess to feeling slightly uneasy.

42:38.600 --> 42:43.080
I know how valuable friendship is and marriage, too.

42:38.600 --> 42:43.080
I don't want to, um,

42:43.120 --> 42:46.280
wreck one without good reason.

42:46.320 --> 42:48.080
Yeah, so Mr Knight, if you could confess

42:48.120 --> 42:49.800
to killing Mr Talbot, that'd be great.

42:49.840 --> 42:51.320
What?

42:51.360 --> 42:53.440
And Mrs Knight, if you could confess to covering it up,

42:53.480 --> 42:55.000
that'd be most appreciated.

42:57.720 --> 42:59.720
Go on, it'd be much easier.

42:59.760 --> 43:02.160
I suggest you leave right now.

43:02.200 --> 43:04.720
I'll be making a formal complaint to

43:02.200 --> 43:04.720
your senior officer.

43:04.760 --> 43:09.080
You know full well Megan admitted to killing

43:04.760 --> 43:09.080
Lucas on the beach.

43:09.120 --> 43:12.000
Lucas wasn't dead on the beach.

43:12.600 --> 43:13.840
Not dead.

43:13.880 --> 43:15.240
The wound on the side of his head

43:15.280 --> 43:16.880
that we thought was caused by a propeller strike

43:16.920 --> 43:19.320
was one of two shots Megan took.

43:19.360 --> 43:22.200
-That gun's not even... -RICHARD:

43:19.360 --> 43:22.200
<i>The bullet skimmed his head.</i>

43:22.240 --> 43:24.160
It was enough to drop him to the floor,

43:24.200 --> 43:27.720
enough to cause substantial blood flow to make him

43:24.200 --> 43:27.720
lose consciousness,

43:27.760 --> 43:29.800
but it wasn't enough to kill him.

43:29.840 --> 43:31.120
The second shot missed.

43:31.160 --> 43:32.720
You shot your husband, Mrs Talbot,

43:32.760 --> 43:35.440
as my colleagues pointed out all along,

43:32.760 --> 43:35.440
that's irrefutable.

43:39.840 --> 43:44.080
So, let's ask ourselves, what would a man like this do

43:39.840 --> 43:44.080
in such a situation?

43:47.840 --> 43:50.080
<i>Waking up with</i> <i>the mother of all headaches,</i>

43:50.120 --> 43:52.120
<i>would he go to the police</i> <i>and tell them he'd been shot,</i>

43:52.160 --> 43:54.600
<i>seek justice in</i> <i>the correct way?</i>

43:54.640 --> 43:57.440
<i>Or would he seek revenge?</i>

43:59.920 --> 44:01.360
<i>It was a long hike.</i>

44:01.400 --> 44:03.320
<i>Especially injured</i> <i>and disorientated.</i>

44:03.360 --> 44:05.800
<i>I imagine it took him several</i> <i>hours to make his way</i>

44:03.360 --> 44:05.800
<i>through the woods.</i>

44:05.840 --> 44:09.760
<i>But eventually,</i> <i>he arrived here,</i>

44:05.840 --> 44:09.760
<i>on your lawn.</i>

44:09.800 --> 44:11.360
PATRICK: <i>Aren't you</i>

44:09.800 --> 44:11.360
<i>forgetting something?</i>

44:11.400 --> 44:12.720
RICHARD: Am I?

44:12.760 --> 44:15.960
Yes, you seem to be accusing me of killing Lucas,

44:16.000 --> 44:17.760
but I spent the night in one of your cells.

44:17.800 --> 44:19.440
Oh, yes, I was coming to that.

44:19.480 --> 44:22.400
You see, windows of opportunity

44:19.480 --> 44:22.400
can be large or small.

44:22.440 --> 44:24.400
Yours was tiny.

44:24.440 --> 44:26.600
<i>Your window began when you</i> <i>arrived home</i>

44:24.440 --> 44:26.600
<i>after we released you</i>

44:26.640 --> 44:28.760
<i>and you saw Lucas Talbot.</i>

44:28.800 --> 44:31.440
<i>For reasons we shall come to,</i> <i>this sight terrified you.</i>

44:31.480 --> 44:34.800
Megan... Megan left me for dead.

44:40.640 --> 44:43.200
Patrick

44:46.640 --> 44:49.320
RICHARD:<i> This was the fatal</i> <i>wound that we</i>

44:46.640 --> 44:49.320
<i>found on the body.</i>

44:49.360 --> 44:51.880
From the same gun, but fired by Mr Knight,

44:51.920 --> 44:54.640
not by Mrs Talbot.

44:54.680 --> 44:57.520
I'm sure that Mr Knight concocted some kind of story

44:57.560 --> 44:59.720
to explain why Lucas attacked him.

45:00.360 --> 45:03.240
What was it? He, uh,

45:03.280 --> 45:06.680
begged you for money, you refused,

45:03.280 --> 45:06.680
he threatened to kill you?

45:06.720 --> 45:10.080
But your next problem was that having just killed Lucas,

45:10.120 --> 45:12.000
there were two police officers at your door.

45:13.640 --> 45:15.520
Right, get him in the shed. RICHARD:

45:15.560 --> 45:17.440
<i>This is when Mrs Knight's</i>

45:17.480 --> 45:19.840
<i>professional instinct</i> <i>kicked into action.</i>

45:23.120 --> 45:25.280
<i>The queen of</i> <i>the cover-up got to work,</i>

45:25.320 --> 45:28.600
<i>while Patrick hid the body</i> <i>and cleaned the mattress.</i>

45:31.960 --> 45:35.320
Megan, where on earth have you been?

45:31.960 --> 45:35.320
Where's Lucas?

45:35.360 --> 45:38.480
Mrs Knight? Detective

45:35.360 --> 45:38.480
Inspector Richard Poole.

45:38.520 --> 45:41.400
This is Detective Sergeant Camille Bordey, Honore Police.

45:41.440 --> 45:42.680
May we come in?

45:42.720 --> 45:47.440
Of course. Patrick, darling?

45:42.720 --> 45:47.440
It's the police.

45:49.400 --> 45:51.760
You have a very vivid imagination.

45:51.800 --> 45:53.800
RICHARD: It's the only explanation

45:51.800 --> 45:53.800
that fits the facts.

45:53.840 --> 45:56.360
Good luck getting a jury to agree with you.

45:56.400 --> 45:58.920
Obviously, I have evidence.

45:58.960 --> 46:01.720
It was the first thing you took

45:58.960 --> 46:01.720
out of the dumpster, Fidel.

46:01.760 --> 46:03.600
Only, we didn't know it.

46:05.920 --> 46:10.360
Not from an item of clothing. It was a stud.

46:10.400 --> 46:15.120
Torn from the sun-bed, when Mr Knight dragged Mr

46:10.400 --> 46:15.120
Talbot's corpse off.

46:23.560 --> 46:25.040
Once I knew where the button came from,

46:25.080 --> 46:27.680
it was clear that Mr Talbot couldn't have

46:25.080 --> 46:27.680
died on the beach.

46:27.720 --> 46:30.520
CAMILLE:<i> And as the watch</i> <i>snagged on the button,</i>

46:30.560 --> 46:32.520
<i>it started</i> <i>the stopwatch function.</i>

46:33.080 --> 46:34.440
Exactly.

46:34.480 --> 46:36.800
We arrived here at 9:30 a.m.

46:36.840 --> 46:42.320
and I turned off the stopwatch at 10:53 a.m.

46:42.360 --> 46:44.320
An hour and 23 minutes.

46:44.360 --> 46:47.240
The time it took for you to load the body into

46:44.360 --> 46:47.240
the car and drive it down

46:47.280 --> 46:49.560
to somewhere secluded enough to dump

46:47.280 --> 46:49.560
it into the sea,

46:49.600 --> 46:53.040
no doubt throwing the gun in after it, which explains why

46:49.600 --> 46:53.040
it was never found.

46:53.080 --> 46:55.360
-This is a joke. -Afraid not.

46:55.400 --> 46:59.480
You see, I have established means and opportunity.

46:55.400 --> 46:59.480
Everything fits.

46:59.520 --> 47:01.200
Which brings me back to motive.

47:01.240 --> 47:03.760
See, reports of Mr Talbot drinking

47:01.240 --> 47:03.760
on the night of his death

47:03.800 --> 47:06.680
all said that he was busy texting on his mobile phone,

47:06.720 --> 47:08.680
which isn't strictly true, on two counts.

47:08.720 --> 47:11.200
Firstly, he was reading text messages

47:11.240 --> 47:13.440
and secondly, it wasn't his phone, remember?

47:15.360 --> 47:16.640
It was his wife's.

47:18.680 --> 47:22.480
There's an exchange of texts - quite graphic texts, in fact -

47:22.520 --> 47:25.160
between Mrs Talbot and her lover.

47:25.200 --> 47:27.320
There's no name, there's just a number.

47:29.280 --> 47:31.480
<i>That's why I</i> <i>wanted Mrs Talbot here,</i>

47:31.520 --> 47:34.720
<i>so we could see her</i> <i>and Mr Knight together.</i>

47:34.760 --> 47:38.560
<i>Because they were your texts,</i> <i>weren't they, Mr Knight?</i>

47:38.600 --> 47:40.920
<i>You were having an affair</i> <i>with Mrs Talbot.</i>

47:42.200 --> 47:44.520
That phone is dead.

47:44.560 --> 47:47.720
It was in the sea. This is all bluff.

47:47.760 --> 47:49.120
You're trying to stand up to a bigger man

47:49.160 --> 47:51.040
than yourself, Inspector, and you'll fail.

47:51.080 --> 47:54.800
In a bar you could intimidate me,

47:51.080 --> 47:54.800
Mr Knight, but here, no.

47:54.840 --> 47:57.080
You stupid bastard!

48:01.560 --> 48:05.000
Mr Talbot discovered the affair after looking at his

48:01.560 --> 48:05.000
wife's mobile phone.

48:05.040 --> 48:08.840
He was drinking that night so he could get Dutch courage

48:05.040 --> 48:08.840
to confront you both.

48:08.880 --> 48:11.200
And he was threatening to go back into the restaurant

48:11.240 --> 48:14.480
to tell your wife, wasn't he? That's why you

48:11.240 --> 48:14.480
were punching him.

48:14.520 --> 48:17.160
And that's what your argument on the beach was about,

48:14.520 --> 48:17.160
wasn't it?

48:17.200 --> 48:20.280
Little mousy Megan.

48:20.320 --> 48:22.240
If people only knew!

48:25.280 --> 48:29.120
You couldn't afford to have your affair exposed, could

48:25.280 --> 48:29.120
you? Not yet.

48:29.160 --> 48:32.280
Not whilst your wife was in the process of

48:29.160 --> 48:32.280
financing your new company.

48:35.720 --> 48:39.560
So, the woman who prides herself on being in the know,

48:39.600 --> 48:42.880
on being in control and orchestrating things,

48:42.920 --> 48:45.160
was the one person in this entire sordid affair

48:45.200 --> 48:47.800
that didn't know the truth.

48:47.840 --> 48:53.000
You killed my best friend so you could

48:47.840 --> 48:53.000
steal his wife and my money.

48:53.040 --> 48:55.400
Shut up! He can't really

48:53.040 --> 48:55.400
prove any of this.

48:55.440 --> 48:57.480
You know, our... Our lawyers will

48:55.440 --> 48:57.480
tear them to shreds.

48:57.520 --> 49:00.040
My lawyers, and they'll do

48:57.520 --> 49:00.040
nothing of the kind.

49:01.400 --> 49:02.880
Well, you'll go down too, you helped me!

49:02.920 --> 49:05.160
A loyal wife trying to protect her philandering husband?

49:05.200 --> 49:07.040
I think I can work with that.

49:10.920 --> 49:13.880
Megan.

49:13.920 --> 49:17.400
You didn't kill your husband, but the truth is you

49:13.920 --> 49:17.400
were far from innocent.

49:35.680 --> 49:38.560
The texts on here are all jumbled.

49:35.680 --> 49:38.560
You can't read them.

49:38.600 --> 49:41.800
-You bluffed him.

49:41.840 --> 49:43.720
Bullies always crumble when you stand your ground.

49:43.760 --> 49:45.560
I learnt that one the hard way.

49:53.680 --> 49:57.120
-Absolutely.

49:57.160 --> 49:59.120
-No.

50:02.160 --> 50:04.240
To be honest, I've never quite worked that out.

50:04.280 --> 50:07.920
But I suspect that women who shoot you in the head aren't

50:04.280 --> 50:07.920
too high up the list.

50:16.240 --> 50:19.200
Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!

50:19.240 --> 50:20.320
Yes!

50:23.040 --> 50:25.760
FIDEL: Sir

50:25.800 --> 50:28.360
RICHARD: One knock will suffice,

50:25.800 --> 50:28.360
thank you.

50:34.160 --> 50:35.480
What do you think?

50:35.520 --> 50:37.560
Well, I like the way you've painted it one colour,

50:37.600 --> 50:41.040
instead of the 15 colours things

50:37.600 --> 50:41.040
have to be painted over here.

50:41.080 --> 50:43.280
Are you going to give her a test?

50:43.320 --> 50:44.800
What, out there, in the sea?

50:44.840 --> 50:46.680
No, no, on the road.

50:51.320 --> 50:52.520
Come on!

50:57.040 --> 51:00.240
So, what do think of the name?

51:00.280 --> 51:01.480
Perfect!

51:02.640 --> 51:04.400
<i>Voila!</i>

51:08.240 --> 51:10.120
Very well, I name this boat...

51:12.080 --> 51:14.440
Actually, it's probably not a good idea to spread

51:12.080 --> 51:14.440
glass on the beach.

51:14.480 --> 51:18.000
Um, Fidel... Yeah.

51:18.040 --> 51:20.520
I name this boat Roast Beef.

51:20.560 --> 51:23.240
May God bless her and all who sail in her.

51:31.360 --> 51:34.600
It's okay. It's okay. You can relax now.

51:34.640 --> 51:36.200
Don't push me!

51:36.240 --> 51:38.240
CAMILLE: I am just trying to get you a drink.

51:38.280 --> 51:40.200
RICHARD: Sorry.

51:40.240 --> 51:42.360
This always used to happen at school.

51:42.400 --> 51:44.800
But you're not at school any more.

51:44.840 --> 51:47.720
You're here, on Sainte-Marie, with some friends.

51:47.760 --> 51:50.840
Colleagues, predominantly, but I take your point.

51:54.040 --> 51:55.920
-Cheers! -Cheers!
