00:27.736 --> 00:28.778
In order to get outside

00:28.904 --> 00:31.322
and get this guy in a rear naked choke,
and he passes out.

00:31.448 --> 00:32.824
- Oh, fuck. Really?
- Yeah.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.742
- That's terrible.
- No, it was awesome.

00:36.120 --> 00:39.330
I'm Robbie Barkley, and you're
watching "Hollywood Extreme."

00:39.456 --> 00:41.666
And another young man
comes forward with allegations

00:41.792 --> 00:43.960
that he was sexually molested
by Michael Jackson

00:44.086 --> 00:46.254
while visiting the Neverland Ranch.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.673
His parents claimed
to keep the secret under wraps

00:48.799 --> 00:50.007
because they loved his music.

00:50.134 --> 00:51.676
Why don't they
just leave him alone?

00:51.802 --> 00:53.386
All Michael ever wanted to do
was make people happy.

00:53.512 --> 00:54.554
That's all he wanted to do.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.763
You know, people don't know
what happened

00:55.889 --> 00:57.056
between him and those kids.
They weren't there.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.391
They're just a bunch of jealous haters.

00:58.517 --> 01:00.727
I hate people who say bad things
about Michael Jackson.

01:00.853 --> 01:01.936
I fucking hate haters!

01:02.062 --> 01:03.813
I hate my neighbors.

01:03.939 --> 01:06.023
The constant cacophony of stupidity

01:06.150 --> 01:09.152
that pours from their apartment
is absolutely soul-crushing.

01:09.278 --> 01:10.445
And you know what?
And I looked him right in the eye.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.572
I go, "You're retarded," and then I
punched him right in the face.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.699
It doesn't matter
how politely I ask them

01:14.825 --> 01:17.410
to practice some common courtesy.

01:17.536 --> 01:21.748
They're incapable of comprehending
that their actions affect other people.

01:21.874 --> 01:25.168
They have a complete lack
of consideration for anyone else

01:25.294 --> 01:28.212
and an overly developed sense
of entitlement.

01:28.338 --> 01:32.675
They have no decency,
no concern, no shame.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.218
They do not care that I suffer

01:34.344 --> 01:37.472
from debilitating migraines
and insomnia.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.141
They do not care
that I have to go to work

01:40.267 --> 01:42.602
or that I want to kill them.

01:42.728 --> 01:45.605
I know it's not normal to want to kill.

01:45.731 --> 01:49.025
But I also know
that I am no longer normal.

01:49.151 --> 01:51.611
I hate that baby.

01:51.737 --> 01:55.823
I hate that baby's fat, stupid face.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.744
Hey, buddy. What's wrong?

02:00.954 --> 02:02.038
A lot.

02:02.164 --> 02:04.207
I'm Robbie Barkley,
and this has been "Hollywood"...

02:07.961 --> 02:09.086
Take it easy, bro.

02:09.213 --> 02:10.838
I'm not your bro.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.716
Oh, God!

02:13.842 --> 02:17.136
Please don't shoot!
I have a baby!

02:44.498 --> 02:46.791
Look at this, look at this.
This is just tragic.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.459
Oh, God.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.753
What is wrong with Lindsay Lohan?

02:50.879 --> 02:53.506
She used to have a lot of potential.
I don't know what happened.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.093
It's the most
hilarious ringtone ever!

02:57.219 --> 02:59.095
Just text P-I-G-F-A-R...

02:59.221 --> 03:01.347
Controversial Reverend
Artemus Goran

03:01.473 --> 03:02.765
and his supporters
are back in the news.

03:02.891 --> 03:06.394
This time protesting
at a cancer victim's funeral.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.021
God hates fags! God hates fags!

03:09.147 --> 03:10.231
God hates fags!

03:12.734 --> 03:14.068
- VELOCitea.
- VELOCitea.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.361
It's in your face.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.949
Coming up on "Tuff Gurlz"...

03:23.245 --> 03:25.454
Listen, you... skank,
don't you...

03:28.000 --> 03:30.418
Did you... poop in my food?!

03:30.544 --> 03:32.837
What? What?

03:32.963 --> 03:35.256
You bitch!

03:40.095 --> 03:44.015
I think she's a traitor
and should be tried for treason.

03:44.141 --> 03:47.393
Look, just because
she lost her son in the war

03:47.519 --> 03:49.520
does not give her the right

03:49.646 --> 03:52.315
to disrespect
all of our brave sons and daughters

03:52.441 --> 03:54.734
who are serving our country right now.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.987
Frankly, I think
her son's better off dead,

03:58.113 --> 04:00.573
because now he doesn't have
to see the jerk

04:00.699 --> 04:02.199
that his mother has turned into.

04:02.326 --> 04:03.784
And, now, I know, I know.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.120
Before you all start
flying off the handle with,

04:06.246 --> 04:09.123
"Oh, Mike, how can you be
so heartless?"

04:09.249 --> 04:11.709
let me remind you,
there's three things I love...

04:11.835 --> 04:14.420
my mother, my country,

04:14.546 --> 04:17.255
and the men and women
who fight the fight over there

04:17.382 --> 04:18.798
so we don't have to fight it here.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.009
That's it for "Fuller Talk."

04:20.135 --> 04:21.344
You've heard the end of the statement.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.012
Remember to order
all your "Fuller Talk" products

04:23.138 --> 04:24.472
at the 800 number
at the bottom of the screen.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.390
We've still got plenty
of T-shirts available.

04:26.516 --> 04:27.934
Remember, two for...

04:28.060 --> 04:30.269
The boys were caught
after setting the homeless man on fire

04:30.395 --> 04:33.272
and then posting video footage
of the attack online.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.107
Dumb Nutz!

04:35.233 --> 04:38.694
Dumb Nutz!

04:48.372 --> 04:49.705
Dude, are you all right?

04:49.831 --> 04:50.957
Dumb Nutz!

04:51.083 --> 04:53.125
We have a press

04:53.251 --> 04:56.420
that just gives him a free pass
because he's black

04:56.546 --> 04:57.797
so he doesn't have to work hard

04:57.923 --> 05:00.925
like the rest of us
who play by the rules.

05:01.051 --> 05:04.720
That... is the world we live in,
ladies and gentlemen.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.931
- What's your name?
- Steven Clark.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.391

05:44.886 --> 05:47.847

Do...

05:55.564 --> 05:56.605
Do you have a mental problem?

05:56.732 --> 05:59.442
No.

05:59.568 --> 06:00.818
Go get some psychiatric help.

06:00.944 --> 06:03.279
I'll see you in Hollywood.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.531
I can't answer that question.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.576
He also killed
his wife and mother,

06:08.702 --> 06:11.871
bringing the total
to 16 dead and 33 wounded,

06:11.997 --> 06:14.623
all in one tragic afternoon.

06:14.750 --> 06:17.418
A former altar boy and Eagle Scout,

06:17.544 --> 06:21.922
he climbed the University of Texas
clock tower in 1966

06:22.049 --> 06:24.884
and, using his high-powered
rifles and Marine training,

06:25.010 --> 06:28.929
he became America's first spree killer.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.730
Meet Steven Clark,
the newest star

06:37.856 --> 06:39.732
from last night's "American Superstarz."

06:39.858 --> 06:41.400
Now, if you missed the show,

06:41.526 --> 06:43.277
you might want
to plug your ears for this one.

That's my favorite part of the show,
when they have the crazies on.

06:54.539 --> 06:55.664
I know.

06:55.791 --> 06:58.250
I feel so guilty for laughing,
but it is so funny.

06:58.376 --> 07:01.378
Wake up! This is ridicu...

07:18.355 --> 07:20.189
- Good morning.
- Yeah?

07:20.315 --> 07:22.775
- Who is it?
- You blocked me in again.

07:22.901 --> 07:25.152
You blocked yourself in, bro.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.905
Okay.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.908
Could you move your car?
I'm running kind of late.

07:32.536 --> 07:33.828
Now?

07:33.954 --> 07:36.122
Yeah.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.707
Tell him to park his car
away from us.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.296
Fine.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.506
Do you know
where the remote is?

07:45.632 --> 07:48.843
Dude, you need
to leave yourself more room.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.469
Right.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.012
In fact, 40% of adult Americans

07:52.139 --> 07:54.765
cannot read
above a fourth-grade level.

07:54.891 --> 07:55.975
When high schoolers were asked

07:56.101 --> 07:58.269
what living American
they would want to be,

07:58.395 --> 08:00.604
the majority of girls
answered Kim Kardashian,

08:00.730 --> 08:01.897
and the majority of boys

08:02.023 --> 08:05.109
answered any male cast member
on the "Jersey Shore."

08:05.235 --> 08:07.361
We are listener-supported radio.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.863
We can only stay on the air with...

08:10.907 --> 08:12.533
I'm really late, Ed.

08:26.923 --> 08:30.217
How about you remember
how to park your fucking car?

08:33.346 --> 08:35.306
Hey, if he plays this well
with one testicle,

08:35.432 --> 08:37.183
maybe the whole team should get cancer.

08:38.602 --> 08:41.437
Send all angry letters
and cards to the E-Man here.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.981
What?
Okay, well, I'm the bad guy, all right?

08:44.107 --> 08:45.774
What? I'm just saying
what you're all thinking.

08:45.901 --> 08:47.443
This ain't your daddy's sports show.

08:47.569 --> 08:50.571
The mucho macho grande
burrito machismo experience.

08:50.697 --> 08:51.780
It's extreme.

08:53.992 --> 08:56.869
This is my favorite part
of "American Superstarz,"

08:56.995 --> 08:59.038
when they have the retards on.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.248
- I know what you mean.
- This thing is great!

09:01.374 --> 09:02.166
We're giving you

09:02.292 --> 09:05.711
backstage passes, and all you have to do
is touch her on the tit

09:05.837 --> 09:07.338
and then maybe box a little bit.

09:07.464 --> 09:08.881
Jesus, how long have you
worked on this show,

09:09.007 --> 09:10.674
and you don't know
how to screen the dirty girls?

09:10.800 --> 09:12.259
We want to see blood,
we want to see tears,

09:12.385 --> 09:14.595
we want to see one
of you whores get knocked out.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.681
Hit her in her defective tit.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.271
Hi.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.981
What's up? You called.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.943
I was just trying to figure out
what time to pick up Ava tomorrow.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.111
Ava says she doesn't want to visit you.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.655
Yeah, well, she's going to.

09:32.781 --> 09:34.365
Frank, I can't make her.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.992
Yes, you can. You're the adult.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.494
Put her on the phone.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.287
All right.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.039
Hey, Ava, honey...

09:42.165 --> 09:43.749
It's your dad.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.085
I'm doing something important.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.128
Well, maybe you can press "pause"?

09:48.255 --> 09:50.839
But I'm almost to the next level!

09:50.966 --> 09:52.841
Hit "pause."

09:57.264 --> 09:58.597
Hi, Daddy.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.642
Hey, kid!
You excited to come see me tomorrow?

10:01.768 --> 10:03.185
I want to stay with mommy.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.520
Why?

10:04.646 --> 10:08.232
Because there's nothing to do
at your house.

10:08.358 --> 10:11.110
What do you mean there's nothing to do?
We do lots of stuff.

10:11.236 --> 10:14.738
We play in the park, we go to the zoo,
we make art.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.490
Your house is boring!

10:16.616 --> 10:18.284
Well, you're coming to see me.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.785
Do you have a present for me?

10:19.911 --> 10:21.328
No.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.664
Hey.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.374
Where'd she go?

10:25.500 --> 10:27.584
She just handed the phone back.

10:27.711 --> 10:30.796
You know, I should have never let you
move her out of town.

10:30.922 --> 10:35.009
Frank, she didn't like to come visit you
even when we lived in Syracuse.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.802
All right, well, Alison,

10:36.928 --> 10:39.013
see what you can do
about changing her mind, okay?

10:39.139 --> 10:41.056
Bye.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.641
So, we're done talking?

10:42.767 --> 10:46.312
No, Brad. Oh, hey, listen...

10:46.438 --> 10:50.649
I'm not sure I remembered to tell you,
but...

10:50.775 --> 10:52.401
Brad and I are getting married.

10:52.527 --> 10:55.863
Well, tell Brad...

10:55.989 --> 10:58.240
when he's down there
to smell my balls, all right?

11:00.076 --> 11:02.411
Frank says hi.

11:02.537 --> 11:04.496
Tell him hi back.

11:04.622 --> 11:05.789
Bye, Ava!

11:07.417 --> 11:10.294
Alison, get her to come, okay?

11:10.420 --> 11:11.587
It means everything to me.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.505
God, Frank, I'll try, all right?

11:13.631 --> 11:14.923
You are such a drama queen.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.842
Drama queen! Drama queen!

11:16.968 --> 11:19.303
Daddy is a drama queen!

11:19.429 --> 11:21.889
Yeah, thanks.

11:30.482 --> 11:31.940
Hi, Karen.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.567
Hi.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.030
Here's that book
I was telling you about.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.407
Thanks.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.083
True, true.
But you know what I was thinking?

11:49.209 --> 11:51.293
If he plays that good
with only one testicle,

11:51.419 --> 11:52.961
maybe the whole team should get cancer.

11:53.088 --> 11:54.797
Oh, killed it, boss!

11:54.923 --> 11:56.173
I can't believe you said that!

11:56.299 --> 11:59.218
Oh, come on, I'm just saying
what you're all thinking.

12:01.721 --> 12:05.140
Oh, my God!
I feel so bad for him. Is he for real?

12:05.266 --> 12:06.350
Yes, he's for real.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.227
He was on "Fat Boy" this morning.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.604
That's real all right... real bad!

12:10.730 --> 12:13.941
Oh! You're real bad!

12:14.067 --> 12:16.360
I think he's good.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.694
Not!

12:17.821 --> 12:20.030
You scared me. You had me.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.620
I think I hurt my back
on that one!

12:30.542 --> 12:33.001
You probably like him secretly.

12:33.128 --> 12:34.837
See? Right there.

12:34.963 --> 12:38.048
♪ Do you like the things
that life is... ♪

12:38.174 --> 12:40.509
Here comes his pitchy part.
Yeah.

12:40.635 --> 12:43.971
♪ Where are you going to? ♪

12:48.184 --> 12:50.310
♪ ...what you're hoping for? ♪

12:50.437 --> 12:54.481
♪ When you look behind you,
there's no open door ♪

12:54.607 --> 12:59.111
♪ What are you hoping for? ♪

12:59.237 --> 13:02.030
So, what about you, Frank?

13:02.157 --> 13:05.325
Did you see that freak
on "American Superstarz" last night?

13:05.452 --> 13:06.577
What?

13:06.703 --> 13:09.329
Last night, the freak
on "American Superstarz"?

13:09.456 --> 13:10.789
No.

13:10.915 --> 13:14.209
I mean, yes,
I saw that guy accidentally.

13:14.335 --> 13:17.880
I don't watch "American Superstarz."

13:18.006 --> 13:19.423
You don't watch it, but you saw him.

13:19.549 --> 13:22.801
Yeah, right.
What, are you too good for the show?

13:22.927 --> 13:25.512
Yeah, I'm too good for a karaoke contest

13:25.638 --> 13:27.723
that makes stars
out of people with no talent.

13:27.849 --> 13:29.766
You can't say that, dude!

13:29.893 --> 13:31.643
Some of those kids have real talent.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.353
No, they don't.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.982
They have good pitch.
They're relatively clean.

13:37.108 --> 13:40.068
They're non-threatening
to little girls and old ladies.

13:40.195 --> 13:41.695
They have the ability to stand in line

13:41.821 --> 13:45.616
with a stadium full of other
desperate and confused people.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.910
But I assure you, they are talent-free.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.829
Yeah, well, I bet 32 million people
would disagree with you, bro,

13:50.955 --> 13:53.999
'cause that's how many people called in
to vote last year on the finale.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.920
I wish I was a super-genius inventor

13:58.046 --> 13:59.796
and could come up with a way
to make a telephone

13:59.923 --> 14:02.007
into an explosive device
that was triggered

14:02.133 --> 14:05.636
by the "American Superstarz"
voting number.

14:05.762 --> 14:08.347
The battery could explode
and leave a mark on the face

14:08.473 --> 14:12.559
so I could know who to avoid talking to
before they even talked.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.478
Yeah, I could look and say,

14:14.604 --> 14:17.314
"Mm, no, you're not gonna be
saying anything

14:17.440 --> 14:19.441
that's gonna add any value to my life."

14:19.567 --> 14:21.818
Yeah, but it's funny.
I mean, you gotta admit that.

14:21.945 --> 14:24.071
Steven Clark, that's funny shit, Frank.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.366
It's not nice to laugh
at someone who's not all there.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.910
It's the same type
of freak-show distraction

14:30.036 --> 14:33.830
that comes along every time
a mighty empire starts collapsing.

14:33.957 --> 14:36.542
"American Superstarz"
is the new Colosseum.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.835
And I won't participate
in watching a show

14:38.962 --> 14:42.923
where the weak are torn apart
every week for our entertainment.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.758
I'm done, really.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.010
Everything is so cruel now.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.304
I just want it all to stop.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.181
I feel sorry
for Jennifer Aniston.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.849
Oh, yeah, it's tragic.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.768
You know, and I don't care
how many foreigners she adopts,

14:54.894 --> 14:56.228
I do not like Angelina Jolie.

14:56.354 --> 14:57.437
Me either!

14:57.564 --> 15:00.440
I mean, nobody talks
about anything any more.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.318
They just regurgitate
everything they see on TV

15:03.444 --> 15:06.321
or hear on the radio
or watch on the web.

15:06.447 --> 15:09.157
When was the last time you had
a real conversation with someone

15:09.284 --> 15:10.409
without somebody texting

15:10.535 --> 15:13.870
or looking at a screen
or a monitor over your head?

15:13.997 --> 15:16.206
You know, a conversation
about something

15:16.332 --> 15:22.504
that wasn't celebrities, gossip, sports,
or pop politics?

15:22.630 --> 15:24.047
You know, something...

15:24.173 --> 15:27.467
something important
or something personal?

15:30.138 --> 15:31.888
You know what?

15:32.015 --> 15:34.016
"Tate and Jeff" were talking
about that this morning.

15:34.142 --> 15:38.270
They were saying how their freedom
of speech is in jeopardy.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.063
What, you don't listen to them, either?

15:40.189 --> 15:41.690
No, I don't.

15:43.026 --> 15:45.569
What, are you more of
a "K.T. and the Snake Pit" type of guy?

15:45.695 --> 15:47.696
'Cause those guys are pussies,
Frank, all right?

15:47.822 --> 15:49.990
And they stole everything they got
from "Tate and Jeff."

15:50.116 --> 15:52.367
I really don't like any of them.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.161
How can you say that, bro?

15:54.287 --> 15:55.871
So, maybe they're not
"politically correct,"

15:55.997 --> 15:57.706
but it's funny, Frank.

15:57.832 --> 16:01.585
Well, seeing how as I'm not afraid
of foreigners or people with vaginae,

16:01.711 --> 16:04.046
I guess I'm just not
their target audience.

16:04.172 --> 16:05.213
You don't get it.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.299
If you got it,
you wouldn't be so offended.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.718
Oh, I get it, and I am offended.

16:09.844 --> 16:11.136
Not because I got a problem

16:11.262 --> 16:14.848
with bitter, predictable,
whiny millionaire disc jockeys

16:14.974 --> 16:18.477
complaining about celebrities
or how tough their life is,

16:18.603 --> 16:20.771
while I live in an apartment
with paper-thin walls

16:20.897 --> 16:22.272
next to a couple of Neanderthals

16:22.398 --> 16:24.399
who, instead of a baby,
decided to give birth

16:24.525 --> 16:27.944
to some kind of nocturnal
civil defense air-raid siren

16:28.071 --> 16:30.906
that goes off every fucking night
like it's Pearl Harbor.

16:31.032 --> 16:33.617
I'm not offended that they act
like it's my responsibility

16:33.743 --> 16:38.163
to protect their rights to pick
on the weak like pack animals

16:38.289 --> 16:41.166
or that we're supposed to support
their freedom of speech

16:41.292 --> 16:43.460
when they don't give a fuck
about yours or mine.

16:43.586 --> 16:46.004
So you're against freedom of speech now?

16:46.130 --> 16:47.798
That's in the Bill of Rights, man.

16:49.884 --> 16:54.179
I would defend their freedom of speech
if I thought it was in jeopardy.

16:54.305 --> 16:55.931
I would defend their freedom of speech

16:56.057 --> 17:01.353
to tell uninspired, bigoted blow-job,
gay-bashing racist and rape jokes

17:01.479 --> 17:04.940
all under the guise of being edgy,
but that's not the edge.

17:05.066 --> 17:06.316
That's what sells.

17:06.442 --> 17:10.862
They couldn't possibly pander any harder
or be more commercially mainstream,

17:10.988 --> 17:14.491
because this is the "Oh, no,
you didn't say that" generation,

17:14.617 --> 17:17.452
where a shocking comment
has more weight than the truth.

17:17.578 --> 17:21.498
No one has any shame any more,
and we're supposed to celebrate it.

17:21.624 --> 17:24.041
I saw a woman throw a used tampon

17:24.167 --> 17:26.420
at another woman last night
on network television,

17:26.546 --> 17:30.006
a network that bills itself
as "Today's Woman's" channel.

17:30.133 --> 17:34.136
Kids beat each other blind
and post it on YouTube.

17:34.262 --> 17:35.929
I mean, do you remember

17:36.055 --> 17:39.641
when eating rats and maggots
on "Survivor" was shocking?

17:39.767 --> 17:42.269
It all seems so quaint now.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.938
I'm sure the girls
from "Two Girls, One Cup"

17:45.064 --> 17:48.275
are gonna have their own
dating show on VH 1 any day now.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.486
I mean, why have a civilization any more

17:51.612 --> 17:55.490
if we no longer are interested
in being civilized?

17:58.870 --> 18:00.829
Frank...

18:00.955 --> 18:02.748
Can I see you in my office?

18:02.874 --> 18:05.333
Yeah, sure.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.797
Come on in. Have a seat.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.265
- You know Ronald from HR.
- Yeah, yeah.

18:20.391 --> 18:22.851
- Hello.
- Hi.

18:24.854 --> 18:28.023
Frank, there's no easy way
to bring this up,

18:28.149 --> 18:30.650
so... let's just cut to the chase.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.488
What is your relationship
to Karen in reception?

18:34.614 --> 18:37.491
Frank, what is your relationship
to Karen in reception?

18:37.617 --> 18:41.411
Oh, well, I just started
talking to her recently.

18:41.537 --> 18:42.662
She's very nice.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.499
We sit together at lunch.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.834
Is something wrong?

18:47.960 --> 18:49.544
What is she accused of?

18:49.670 --> 18:50.796
I find it hard to believe

18:50.922 --> 18:52.881
that she would ever do anything
to hurt the company.

18:53.007 --> 18:54.716
I see.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.638
Did you send Karen
flowers to her home?

18:59.764 --> 19:01.181
Yeah.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.183
Yeah, I did.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.560
Why?

19:05.686 --> 19:07.687
Well, she said
she was having a bad day,

19:07.814 --> 19:10.607
and I thought it would
make her feel better.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.526
How did you get her address?

19:12.652 --> 19:15.737
I looked it up.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.656
I went in the records.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.700
You understand that's a huge violation
of company policy, right?

19:20.827 --> 19:23.119
Well, yeah, but I didn't want
to have them delivered to the office.

19:23.246 --> 19:24.371
I didn't want to embarrass...

19:24.497 --> 19:26.122
Frank, I'm going to have to let you go.

19:26.249 --> 19:28.208
You're kidding, right?

19:28.334 --> 19:30.335
No, Frank, I'm not kidding.

19:30.461 --> 19:32.712
This company has
a strict no-tolerance policy

19:32.839 --> 19:35.507
about harassment
in the workplace, and...

19:35.633 --> 19:38.969
Well, Karen doesn't feel safe
with you employed here.

19:39.095 --> 19:42.264
She's never said anything
like that to me.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.349
Why don't I go talk to her,
and then we'll...

19:44.475 --> 19:46.852
Frank, listen to me for a second.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.146
Now...

19:53.109 --> 19:55.193
I want you to leave quietly.

19:55.319 --> 19:58.655
Don't harass Karen or anyone else
on the staff as you leave.

19:58.781 --> 20:01.908
Your severance checks
will be mailed to you.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.369
This is ridiculous.
I've been here 11 years.

20:04.495 --> 20:06.454
I know, Frank.
I know it's ridiculous.

20:06.581 --> 20:08.248
But it's not me.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.000
It's the higher-ups.

20:10.126 --> 20:12.836
Let me know if you need
a recommendation.

20:30.605 --> 20:33.982
Would you ask her for my book back?

20:34.108 --> 20:36.276
He wants his book back.

20:38.487 --> 20:39.738
Thank you, Danny.

21:02.845 --> 21:07.307
A tumor this size
is very dangerous.

21:08.601 --> 21:15.732
Unfortunately, surgery to remove it
can be just as dangerous as leaving it.

21:15.858 --> 21:19.527
I advise you to discuss this
with your family.

21:21.405 --> 21:22.614
I'm sorry.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.282
Oh, gotta take this.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.744
Yeah.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.164
What?

21:31.290 --> 21:33.249
I wanted the one with the moon roof.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.043
The... The... The...

21:35.169 --> 21:38.088
No, like the one we test-drove.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.133
I'm going to fuck you.

21:42.259 --> 21:43.385
I'm gonna come down to the dealership

21:43.511 --> 21:45.512
and I'm gonna fuck you in the ass,
you understand?

21:45.638 --> 21:48.431
I'm gonna come down there,
I'm gonna rip your cock off,

21:48.557 --> 21:50.433
I'm gonna shove it right up...
No, you know what?

21:50.559 --> 21:54.312
I'm gonna tear the cock off
of that giant purple gorilla

21:54.438 --> 21:57.148
and shove that up your ass.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.734
Yes, maybe then you should look
into a moon roof.

21:59.860 --> 22:02.278
Yeah, that'd be great.

22:02.405 --> 22:04.447
Thank you!

22:08.160 --> 22:11.997
Do you have any family?

22:12.123 --> 22:14.374
No, not really.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.926
Sir?

22:25.052 --> 22:27.095
You can't be here.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.222
This Tuesday,

22:29.348 --> 22:32.142
forget everything you know
about bowling.

22:32.268 --> 22:35.103
This is bowling on steroids!

22:38.274 --> 22:40.859
Bowling Beatdown Raw!

22:40.985 --> 22:43.903
You think you know bowling?

22:44.030 --> 22:45.947
Suck it!

22:47.241 --> 22:49.826
All right, people, make me happy.
What do you got? Give me something.

22:49.952 --> 22:52.287
We got this dude Steven Clark
from "American Superstarz."

22:52.413 --> 22:54.080
He is a freak, right?!

22:54.206 --> 22:55.707
It's ridiculous! Very funny!

22:56.751 --> 23:02.297
♪ Do you like the things
that life is showing you? ♪

23:02.423 --> 23:03.882

Oh, shock!

23:06.635 --> 23:09.471
You're wasting our time, Steven.

23:09.597 --> 23:10.680
What are you doing?

23:10.806 --> 23:12.557
Stop bowing.
Just stop everything.

I live in Virginia Beach,
and I rule Holy Cross.

23:30.701 --> 23:32.035
I love Chloe.

She's my bestest friend ever,

This party is gonna be amazing! Yeah!

23:50.179 --> 23:52.639
We love you, Chloe!
We love you, Chloe!

23:55.101 --> 23:56.893
I only wear labels,
and since I live in Virginia,

23:57.019 --> 24:00.355
of course I couldn't find a dress
good enough for my party.

24:02.817 --> 24:05.193
So I told daddy we had to go to Paris.

24:05.319 --> 24:07.487
I'm all about couture.

24:07.613 --> 24:08.947
We can be twinsies!

24:09.073 --> 24:10.532
Mother, you look like a whore!

24:12.576 --> 24:13.618
This is about me.

24:13.744 --> 24:15.995
God, I hate you!
You ruin everything!

24:24.130 --> 24:25.964
Use it in good health.

24:26.090 --> 24:28.925
- Happy birthday, sweetheart!
- Remember, no boys in the back.

24:32.096 --> 24:33.847
Baby?

24:33.973 --> 24:35.765
Say something, honey. Come on.

24:35.891 --> 24:38.768
- The camera's on.
- I wanted an Escalade.

24:38.894 --> 24:41.020
- You said...
- Take it back then!

24:41.147 --> 24:43.106
I wanted an Escalade!

24:43.232 --> 24:45.358
- Daddy can take it ba...
- Get away from me!

24:45.484 --> 24:47.694
It's my job as a parent
to make her happy,

24:47.820 --> 24:50.029
so I screwed up this time,
because she's not happy.

24:50.156 --> 24:53.074
That's the evidence of it.
If she's not happy, I screwed up.

24:54.910 --> 24:57.495
So, tell us all about Chloe!

24:57.621 --> 25:01.291
Chloe is not just my daughter,
she is my best friend.

25:01.417 --> 25:02.834
Mother!

25:02.960 --> 25:05.086
They're asking me.
I'm very popular.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.671
Everyone loves me
because my family's rich

25:06.797 --> 25:08.131
and because I'm so pretty.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.842
This is the biggest day of my life,
and you're... it up!

25:10.968 --> 25:12.927
Are you serious?!
You're so stupid!

25:13.053 --> 25:16.014
You're not even doing anything!
I'm doing all the work!

25:16.140 --> 25:20.101
What the... is that, Dad?!
What the... is that?!

25:20.227 --> 25:22.520
You know what?
Let's do this without them around.

25:22.646 --> 25:25.315
No, you can stay.
I don't care about you, okay?

25:25.441 --> 25:26.649
All I...

25:30.237 --> 25:31.946
- Hey.
- I hate mommy!

25:32.072 --> 25:33.573
I hate mommy!

25:33.699 --> 25:35.033
What are you talking about?

25:35.159 --> 25:38.453
She got me a Blackberry,
and I wanted an iPhone.

25:38.579 --> 25:41.122
Okay. Okay, honey.

25:41.248 --> 25:42.957
Let me talk to your mommy.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.001
Hello?

25:45.127 --> 25:46.336
You got her a Blackberry?

25:46.462 --> 25:49.172
Look, Frank, I don't want to hear it.
I feel bad enough as it is.

25:49.298 --> 25:51.257
I thought it's what she really wanted.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.260
No, I mean, why would you get her
a Blackberry or an iPhone?

25:54.386 --> 25:56.179
I don't need this right now.

25:56.305 --> 25:59.933
Did you talk to her
about me picking her up?

26:00.059 --> 26:03.186
Ava, princess, do you want
to go see your dad?

26:03.312 --> 26:04.938
I want an iPhone!
I don't want my dad!

26:05.064 --> 26:07.273
I hate going there!
I never want to see him again!

26:07.399 --> 26:09.943
I want an iPhone!
I want an iPhone! I want an iPhone!

26:10.069 --> 26:11.861
Frank, I gotta go.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.502
No, you can stay. You can stay.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.588
I don't care about you, okay?
All I care about is my party.

27:12.715 --> 27:15.216
- Turn that off.
- Dad, listen to me!

27:15.342 --> 27:17.885
This is the biggest day of my life,
and you're... it up!

27:18.012 --> 27:18.928
Are you serious?!

27:19.054 --> 27:21.306
You're so stupid!
You're not even doing anything!

27:21.432 --> 27:23.266
I'm doing all the work!

27:23.392 --> 27:25.268
What the... is that, Dad?!

27:25.394 --> 27:27.103
What the... is that?!

27:27.229 --> 27:29.480
Dad, listen to me!
You're not listening to me!

27:29.606 --> 27:31.774
You're just talking
to the... cameras!

27:34.820 --> 27:37.613
I don't care about gift bags...

Hi.

Nothing.

32:28.530 --> 32:30.990
Great! Me too.

Frank.

Great! It's really excellent
to meet you, Frank.

32:40.626 --> 32:41.876
Tell me all about it.

32:42.002 --> 32:43.919
About what?

32:44.046 --> 32:46.464
Did the bitch cry?

32:47.674 --> 32:48.716
Yeah.

32:50.093 --> 32:52.762
That is... fantastic!

32:52.888 --> 32:55.848
Oh, God, I wish I could have
seen it up close!

32:57.893 --> 33:00.811
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Somebody just made that.

33:02.773 --> 33:05.608

This is the best day ever!

33:05.734 --> 33:06.942
Who are you killing next?

33:07.069 --> 33:08.444
Do you take requests?

33:08.570 --> 33:11.405
'Cause I was thinking
maybe some Kardashians.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.658
My gym coach.

33:13.784 --> 33:15.159
People who give high fives.

33:15.285 --> 33:16.994
Really any jock.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.454
Twihards.

33:18.580 --> 33:21.832
People who talk about "punk rock."

33:21.958 --> 33:24.460
- Who else really rips my cock off?
- Get off the bed.

33:24.586 --> 33:26.629
Oh, Mormons
and other religious assholes

33:26.755 --> 33:28.547
who won't let gay people be married.

33:28.674 --> 33:31.092
And adult women
who call their tits "the girls."

33:31.218 --> 33:32.927
- Like...
- Stop it!

33:34.888 --> 33:39.016
Just, please, be quiet.

33:39.142 --> 33:41.477
Get off the bed?

33:41.603 --> 33:43.479
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

33:43.605 --> 33:46.232
I... I'm kind of busy right now.

33:51.780 --> 33:54.573
Awesome.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.951
Be careful with that.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.501
- Wait.
- No, don't do that.

34:05.627 --> 34:06.919
That's kind of personal.

34:08.422 --> 34:12.800
"Dear Ava,
your life will be better without me."

34:12.926 --> 34:14.385
I'm sorry.

34:14.511 --> 34:16.011
"Love, Dad."

34:19.558 --> 34:21.225
A suicide note?

34:21.351 --> 34:23.268
Are you fucking kidding me?

34:23.395 --> 34:25.396
God, the greatest thing
that ever happened around here,

34:25.522 --> 34:27.356
and you're just some sad-sack pussy?

34:27.482 --> 34:29.567
Goddamn it.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.987
Well, do it, then.
I want to watch.

34:36.699 --> 34:37.908
Let's go!

34:38.034 --> 34:40.578
How do you know I won't kill you?

34:40.704 --> 34:43.205
I don't.

34:43.331 --> 34:47.168
And, frankly, Frank,
I don't fucking care.

35:01.641 --> 35:03.851
Frank?

35:03.977 --> 35:05.102
What?

35:06.229 --> 35:08.230
I got an idea.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.052
Okay, go ahead.

35:38.178 --> 35:40.471
You sure you're ready now?

35:40.597 --> 35:43.516
Yup. All systems go.

35:49.105 --> 35:51.190
Wait again!

35:51.316 --> 35:52.817
Sorry.

35:52.943 --> 35:54.443
Can I say something first?

35:54.569 --> 35:56.111
Go ahead.

35:57.781 --> 36:00.366
You know, it's just that...

36:00.492 --> 36:03.786
you really had the chance
to do something awesome here.

36:03.912 --> 36:05.871
But you're blowing it, Frank.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.081
Now you're just gonna be remembered

36:07.207 --> 36:09.834
as some creepy, old stalker dude
who was in love

36:09.960 --> 36:13.170
with some young twat
on a television show.

36:13.296 --> 36:16.131
Just a pervy old dude
that killed that girl

36:16.258 --> 36:19.760
and then himself
when he couldn't have her.

36:19.886 --> 36:21.011
Wah.

36:21.137 --> 36:24.098
I didn't kill her
because I couldn't have her.

36:24.224 --> 36:27.476
I killed her...
because she wasn't nice.

36:27.602 --> 36:31.021
And that was a fantastic start, Frank!

36:31.147 --> 36:36.277
Your instincts were right on.
She was a class-A cunt.

36:36.403 --> 36:39.113
But with so many horrible people
in the world

36:39.239 --> 36:42.366
who should be taking the big dirt nap...

36:43.493 --> 36:45.995
why quit now?

36:46.121 --> 36:48.163
You kill yourself, Frank,

36:48.290 --> 36:51.000
and you're killing
the wrong person, which...

36:51.126 --> 36:52.209
would be a shame when there are

36:52.335 --> 36:56.589
so many other Chloes out there
who need to die.

36:58.842 --> 36:59.884
Like who?

37:02.262 --> 37:03.762
NASCAR fans.

37:03.889 --> 37:04.930
Country fans.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.641
People who dress their babies
in band T-shirts.

37:07.767 --> 37:10.394
No, no, no, no.
People who deserve to die.

37:12.105 --> 37:14.148
All those people do deserve to die.

37:15.775 --> 37:16.817
No.

37:20.113 --> 37:22.740
Chloe's parents.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.498
If anybody comes, you honk the horn.

37:31.625 --> 37:34.293
But no matter what you don't get out
of the car, you got it?

37:34.419 --> 37:35.794
Aye-aye, captain.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.505
I'm not kidding around.

37:38.632 --> 37:41.467
- Frank...
- What?

37:41.593 --> 37:43.552
This is more fun
than killing yourself, right?

37:43.678 --> 37:46.513
I don't know.

37:46.640 --> 37:48.098
Yeah, I guess.

37:48.224 --> 37:49.892
Frank...

37:51.144 --> 37:52.853
Yeah.

38:07.619 --> 38:08.661
Yeah?

38:08.787 --> 38:10.537
- Get in the house and shut the fuck up.
- Jesus.

38:10.664 --> 38:11.872
Get over here. Get over here.

38:11.998 --> 38:13.165
- Go! Go!
- Honey?

38:13.291 --> 38:15.000
Get over there by the couch.
Get over there.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.377
Do what he says.

38:16.503 --> 38:18.879
What do you want?
We could give you money.

38:19.005 --> 38:21.173
Listen, I'm a very rich man.

38:21.299 --> 38:24.009
Don't you know who we are?
W-We're Chloe's parents!

38:24.135 --> 38:25.386
We were all on TV!

38:25.512 --> 38:27.721
Yeah, I know exactly who you are.

38:27.847 --> 38:29.515
I'm the man that killed your daughter.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.143
Goddamn it!

38:33.269 --> 38:36.105
Oh, God!

39:16.187 --> 39:18.522
- Yes, we did it!
- Hey, hey, hey, get off me!

39:18.648 --> 39:20.399
I told you to stay in the car!

39:20.525 --> 39:22.192
Frank, she was getting away.

39:22.318 --> 39:24.737
You mean "thanks"?

39:24.863 --> 39:27.239
Yeah. Let's go.

39:32.829 --> 39:34.997
That was fucking crazy, right?

39:35.123 --> 39:36.832
Yeah.

39:36.958 --> 39:40.461
I feel...

39:40.587 --> 39:41.670
Good?

39:43.089 --> 39:44.965
Yeah.

39:45.091 --> 39:48.010
I feel good. It's weird.

39:48.136 --> 39:50.763
Thanks. Perfect.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.476
You guys need some extra napkins?

40:06.154 --> 40:07.196
Look, I'm sorry.

40:07.322 --> 40:09.281
I really thought this would work.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.366
All right, my turn.

40:11.493 --> 40:12.576
Try me again.

40:12.702 --> 40:16.747
We're definitely gonna need
some new clothes.

40:16.873 --> 40:19.416
So, where are we going next?

40:19.542 --> 40:20.793
What do you mean "we"?

40:20.919 --> 40:22.628
There's no we.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.880
Frank, you have to take me with you.

40:25.006 --> 40:26.215
No way.

40:26.341 --> 40:28.050
Come on, please?

40:28.176 --> 40:30.928
No. What about your family?

40:31.054 --> 40:32.971
My family?

40:33.098 --> 40:36.809
Well, my mother is what you
would call a crack whore.

40:36.935 --> 40:38.977
I live in a trailer
with her and her boyfriend,

40:39.104 --> 40:43.565
and every night after she passes out
he comes into my room and rapes me.

40:46.903 --> 40:50.614
I don't know what to say.

40:50.740 --> 40:51.824
Well, let's kill them.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.951
Yes!

40:54.077 --> 40:55.119
Wait, no.

40:55.245 --> 40:57.121
No, no, we can't keep killing
people we know.

40:57.247 --> 40:58.455
That's how people get caught.

40:58.581 --> 41:01.542
We have to keep it random.

41:01.668 --> 41:05.087
That's a good idea.

41:05.213 --> 41:07.506
See? I'm already helping.

41:07.632 --> 41:09.258
So, please, Frank?

41:09.384 --> 41:11.051
Can I please come with you?

41:11.177 --> 41:12.261
What about your friends?

41:12.387 --> 41:14.680
I mean, don't you got
any friends you can stay with?

41:14.806 --> 41:16.056
Frank...

41:16.182 --> 41:18.517
I have no friends.

41:20.353 --> 41:21.520
All right.

41:21.646 --> 41:23.647
Really? Oh, thank you!

41:23.773 --> 41:26.191
Hey, listen, you know,
when I say something, it goes.

41:26.317 --> 41:29.027
No more of this shit.
No more acting on your own.

41:29.154 --> 41:31.697
All right. Thank you.

41:36.703 --> 41:38.412
The washing machine's broken.
What?

41:47.297 --> 41:48.463
What are you doing?

41:48.590 --> 41:51.550
Seeing if there's anything
in the news about us or the murders.

41:51.676 --> 41:53.135
- Is there?
- Yeah.

41:53.261 --> 41:55.721
On the murders.
Nothing about us.

41:55.847 --> 41:58.682
"Murdered family
of reality star found"...

41:58.808 --> 42:00.017
Hey, let me see that.

42:04.564 --> 42:05.647
See ya!

42:05.773 --> 42:08.275
Oh, my God!

42:09.485 --> 42:11.987
I had this shirt.

42:12.113 --> 42:13.155
It's still ugly.

42:13.281 --> 42:14.489
What do you think?

42:14.616 --> 42:18.327
I think that might be
a little small on the belly.

42:18.453 --> 42:20.370
So, do you have a girlfriend?

42:20.496 --> 42:22.623
I'm not gonna answer that question.

42:22.749 --> 42:24.166
Why not?

42:24.292 --> 42:25.667
'Cause you're a kid.

42:25.793 --> 42:27.461
I don't want to have
an inappropriately mature

42:27.587 --> 42:29.922
conversation with you, all right?

42:30.048 --> 42:32.925
I was only asking
because I thought you were gay.

42:33.051 --> 42:34.092
Well, I'm not gay.

42:34.219 --> 42:36.178
You seem gay.

42:36.304 --> 42:37.554
- Really?
- Yes.

42:39.766 --> 42:43.727
So, do you? Have a girlfriend?

42:43.853 --> 42:45.646
- No.
- A wife?

42:45.772 --> 42:48.273
I did. Not any more.

42:51.402 --> 42:53.195
Are you attracted to me?

42:53.321 --> 42:55.614
Don't be weird.

42:57.075 --> 42:59.076
You don't like me
because you think I'm ugly?

42:59.202 --> 43:02.496
I'm not attracted to you
because you're a child.

43:02.622 --> 43:04.248
And you think I'm ugly.

43:04.374 --> 43:07.709
I'm not gonna answer that question.

43:07.835 --> 43:09.378
Well, what if we were the same age?

43:09.504 --> 43:11.672
I'm not gonna answer
that question, either.

43:11.798 --> 43:14.591
Oh, so you can kill a teenager,
just not fuck one?

43:14.717 --> 43:16.093
Yeah.

43:16.219 --> 43:19.263
But you do think I'm mature for my age.

43:19.389 --> 43:22.724
Not particularly.

43:22.850 --> 43:25.852
You're seriously not interested
in me at all as a girlfriend?

43:25.979 --> 43:29.064
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm not a pedophile.

43:29.190 --> 43:31.775
What, so we're platonic spree killers?

43:31.901 --> 43:33.944
Yeah, and that's all.

43:34.070 --> 43:35.862
Because you think I'm ugly.

43:35.989 --> 43:39.116
It's unethical for me
to answer that question,

43:39.242 --> 43:42.035
because I refuse to objectify a child.

43:42.161 --> 43:44.830
I mean, that's part
of what's wrong with everything.

43:44.956 --> 43:46.248
I'm not American Apparel.

43:46.374 --> 43:48.792
I'm not the creep that came up
with those Bratz dolls.

43:48.918 --> 43:50.252
All men like young girls.

43:50.378 --> 43:52.504
Oh, that's what society's
trying to sell ya,

43:52.630 --> 43:54.339
but, you know,
maybe it's time for adult males

43:54.465 --> 43:57.301
to aim a little bit higher
than raping kids.

43:57.427 --> 44:01.513
I mean, fuck R. Kelly,
fuck Vladimir Nabokov,

44:01.639 --> 44:04.516
and fuck Mary Kay Letourneau,
while we're at it.

44:05.810 --> 44:06.977
Fuck Woody Allen

44:07.103 --> 44:10.188
and his whole "the heart wants
what it wants" bullshit.

44:10.315 --> 44:12.691
You know, apparently
that erudite genius's heart

44:12.817 --> 44:13.859
wants the same thing

44:13.985 --> 44:16.028
that every run-of-the-mill
pedophile wants...

44:16.154 --> 44:19.531
a young, hairless Asian.

44:20.658 --> 44:23.285
Nobody cares
that they damage other people.

44:23.411 --> 44:27.080
I was just wondering
if you thought I was pretty.

44:27.206 --> 44:31.543
I won't be responsible
for the self-esteem of a teenager.

44:31.669 --> 44:33.712
If you don't like it, you can cram it.

44:33.838 --> 44:37.007
Fuck you, Frank.

44:52.815 --> 44:53.857
Frank?

44:53.983 --> 44:55.442
Hey.

44:57.987 --> 44:59.488
I thought you left.

44:59.614 --> 45:02.074
I thought about it.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.659
I got you something.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.955
Oh, yeah, yeah. I get it.

45:09.082 --> 45:11.124
Bonnie and Clyde?

45:11.250 --> 45:13.293
Well, fine,
you don't have to wear it.

45:13.419 --> 45:15.796
I just don't usually wear hats.

45:15.922 --> 45:17.923
My head looks kind of weird in them.

45:23.096 --> 45:25.806
Although that one
looks pretty good?

45:25.932 --> 45:27.641
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

45:31.020 --> 45:34.898
Yours looks good.
Patty Hearst, right?

45:53.501 --> 45:55.585
Thank you for choosing our theater.

45:55.711 --> 45:59.965
As a courtesy to your fellow patrons,
please refrain from talking

46:00.091 --> 46:05.220
and please turn off your cell phones.

46:06.389 --> 46:10.642
And now enjoy our feature presentation.

46:18.151 --> 46:22.779
War is an atrocity.

46:24.157 --> 46:26.783
I mean, it takes young kids...

46:26.909 --> 46:29.703
good kids, for the most part...

46:29.829 --> 46:32.205
turns them into animals...

46:33.916 --> 46:36.918
Hey, bitch.
No, I'm not doing anything.

46:37.044 --> 46:43.091
I'm in a movie.

46:43.217 --> 46:44.759
Stuff you never thought you'd do.

46:44.886 --> 46:46.511
Oh, hey, look.

46:46.637 --> 46:48.430
How cute, right?

46:48.556 --> 46:51.683
Okay, mom.

46:58.065 --> 47:00.567
Hello? We're in the middle.

47:00.693 --> 47:01.776
We're in the middle!

47:01.903 --> 47:04.404
Sad face! Is that Matt?

47:04.530 --> 47:06.615
Oh, he's bringing food.

47:06.741 --> 47:09.201
Hey, did this really happen?

47:10.786 --> 47:12.746
Munchies!

47:12.872 --> 47:14.956
Thank you!

47:19.003 --> 47:22.631
Some of the guys
start raping their mothers!

47:26.052 --> 47:27.761
Let's go.

47:27.887 --> 47:30.138
We go out, get a smoke...

47:35.937 --> 47:37.854
Sit down.

47:39.482 --> 47:40.607
No place to hide,

47:40.733 --> 47:42.901
because the villages
were supporting these bastards.

47:43.027 --> 47:44.986
So...

47:50.993 --> 47:52.827
Hey, hey.

47:52.954 --> 47:54.037
No, I can't get...

47:54.163 --> 47:56.706
I'm at work.

47:56.832 --> 47:58.291
I can't. You're gonna have
to pick her up today.

47:58.417 --> 48:02.087
I can't get there.
I'm... I'm working.

48:02.213 --> 48:05.048
Yeah. So...

48:05.174 --> 48:07.050
What can I tell you?
I'm swamped.

48:07.176 --> 48:09.302
God.

48:14.308 --> 48:16.518

during the feature.

49:22.710 --> 49:25.253
Thanks for turning off
your cellphone.

49:25.379 --> 49:27.213
You're welcome.

50:06.545 --> 50:10.382
Here.
You can use this thing as a pillow.

50:10.508 --> 50:12.384
Thanks.

50:12.510 --> 50:15.053
- Good night, Frank.
- Good night.

50:45.835 --> 50:48.336
You folks shouldn't be sleeping
out here.

50:48.462 --> 50:51.589
Can I see your license and registration?

50:51.716 --> 50:53.466
Of course, Officer.

50:53.592 --> 50:56.010
My dad keeps everything in here.

50:57.763 --> 50:58.805
I'm...

50:58.931 --> 51:00.974
I'm her uncle.

51:01.100 --> 51:02.225
This is my brother-in-law's car

51:02.351 --> 51:05.311
'cause I'm taking her down
to see some colleges.

51:05.438 --> 51:07.480
Go, big... blue!

51:10.192 --> 51:11.985
You have any ID?

51:12.111 --> 51:14.112
Yes, I do, sir.

51:22.246 --> 51:24.164
All right, I'll be right there.

51:27.084 --> 51:30.003
No more sleeping
on the side of the road.

51:30.129 --> 51:31.921
Do you still need to see my ID?

51:32.047 --> 51:36.176
No, that's fine, honey.
You just stay safe.

51:36.302 --> 51:38.178
Lot of crazy people out there.

51:38.304 --> 51:40.138
Tell me about it.

51:40.264 --> 51:41.347
Thank you, Officer.

51:43.309 --> 51:44.434
What the hell was that about?

51:44.560 --> 51:46.770
Hey, at least I don't steal cars.

51:46.896 --> 51:49.147
What makes you think it's stolen?

51:49.273 --> 51:50.732
All right, I stole it.

51:50.858 --> 51:53.151
But from a jerk.

52:01.285 --> 52:02.994
What is this?

52:03.120 --> 52:05.455
Don't get too attached.

52:10.336 --> 52:13.171
Now you go.

52:14.882 --> 52:16.591
All right,
I'm a little bit bigger than you.

52:16.717 --> 52:18.343
You don't gotta "Dirty Harry" it.

52:18.469 --> 52:20.553
Wrap your other hand around here.

52:20.679 --> 52:22.764
Feel a little stability there?

52:22.890 --> 52:25.141
All right, now do it.

52:26.769 --> 52:29.395
Pretty good.

52:29.522 --> 52:32.398
Just concentrate on that far sight.

52:36.612 --> 52:37.987
You're aiming at the bear, right?

52:38.113 --> 52:39.823
Don't anticipate the recoil.

52:39.949 --> 52:42.575
Just squeeze it and let it go.

52:46.080 --> 52:47.747
That's all bear there.

52:49.375 --> 52:52.043
I think Elvis would be proud.

52:52.169 --> 52:53.294
Pretty good.

52:53.420 --> 52:55.755
Thanks.

52:55.881 --> 52:58.967
3:00.

52:59.093 --> 53:01.970
6:00.

53:02.096 --> 53:05.306
12:00!

53:05.432 --> 53:06.766
9:00!

53:06.892 --> 53:08.935
6:00!

53:09.061 --> 53:10.937
Six!

53:16.902 --> 53:19.237
- Yay!
- Yay.

53:23.117 --> 53:25.660
- Good?
- Yeah.

53:32.376 --> 53:33.418
Migraine?

53:33.544 --> 53:35.044
Yeah.

53:35.170 --> 53:37.630
Well, we could stop shooting.

53:37.756 --> 53:39.841
Yeah, thanks.

53:41.552 --> 53:43.094
You did a good job.

53:43.220 --> 53:44.888
Well, I have a good coach.

53:45.014 --> 53:48.016
That, and I was pretending the targets
were the cast of "Glee."

53:48.142 --> 53:49.517
What's wrong with "Glee"?

53:49.643 --> 53:52.520
It stereotypes and homogenizes
homosexuals.

53:52.646 --> 53:55.189
Plus, it ruined "Rocky Horror" forever.

53:55.316 --> 53:56.941
That's true.

53:57.067 --> 53:59.110
You want my money?
I'll pay for all your healthcare!

53:59.194 --> 54:00.445
Tea Party members

54:00.571 --> 54:02.113
continued to taunt
the Parkinson's sufferer

54:02.239 --> 54:04.282
after he was shoved to the ground.

54:04.408 --> 54:06.868
Parkinson's is what God
gives socialists!

54:06.994 --> 54:08.912
Parkinson's is what God
gives socialists!

54:10.789 --> 54:12.790
God, I'm so depressed.

54:12.917 --> 54:15.793
I mean, I can't believe
there's nothing on about us.

54:15.920 --> 54:18.796
That's one of the problems
of your generation.

54:18.923 --> 54:21.758
You can't enjoy anything
unless it was recorded.

54:21.884 --> 54:23.134
You were there. You lived it.

54:23.260 --> 54:25.136
Isn't that enough of an experience?

54:25.262 --> 54:27.680
I mean, next time you want
to remember something,

54:27.806 --> 54:29.766
instead of taking out your cellphone,

54:29.892 --> 54:33.061
why don't you take a picture of it
with your brain camera?

54:33.187 --> 54:35.813
I mean, when I was your age,
nobody tweeted,

54:35.940 --> 54:38.900
and we managed to have experiences.

54:39.026 --> 54:42.779
You know, the phone was attached
to a wall back at the house.

54:42.905 --> 54:45.031
It didn't have a camera.

54:45.157 --> 54:47.659
What are you, Jeff Foxworthy?

54:47.785 --> 54:50.411
"And a 'cell' phone was the phone
you called your pappy on"

54:50.537 --> 54:51.788
to get you outta jail.

54:51.914 --> 54:54.415
"A-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot."

54:56.126 --> 54:58.878
Some people are blaming
the movie itself for the murders.

54:59.004 --> 55:01.923
Is this violent documentary too violent?

55:02.049 --> 55:03.299
Do you believe that?

55:03.425 --> 55:05.009
I know! We made the news!

55:05.135 --> 55:06.970
No, what they're saying.

55:07.096 --> 55:10.431
Nobody can take personal responsibility
for anything any more.

55:10.557 --> 55:13.101
But that's not what
the lone survivor believes.

55:13.227 --> 55:15.395
- What's the point?
- Everybody was talking...

55:15.521 --> 55:18.856
goofing around, making noise.

55:18.983 --> 55:21.693
I believe they did this
because we were all being so rude.

55:21.819 --> 55:23.903
How about that?

55:24.029 --> 55:26.864
Unbelievable.
The truth, and on this channel.

55:26.991 --> 55:28.408
The suspects are

55:28.534 --> 55:30.660
a Caucasian male
in his mid-to late-50s...

55:30.786 --> 55:32.036
- Late 50s?
- ...and a young woman...

55:32.162 --> 55:35.039
in her early to mid 20s,
also Caucasian.

55:35.165 --> 55:38.251
They are considered armed
and very dangerous.

55:38.377 --> 55:41.587
See? They think I'm mature for my age.

55:41.714 --> 55:43.673
We're famous!

55:43.799 --> 55:46.175
Hey, high five.

55:46.301 --> 55:47.885
Come on,
don't leave me hanging, Rock-o.

55:48.012 --> 55:51.431
No, I don't high five.

55:53.017 --> 55:54.892
Mental high five?

55:56.311 --> 55:58.855
Yeah, mental high five.

55:58.981 --> 56:00.023
Steven Clark.

56:00.149 --> 56:02.066
He wasn't the winner
on "American Superstarz,"

56:02.192 --> 56:03.526
but I think he's a winner.

56:03.652 --> 56:05.695
He's back with a new hit single.

Literal people, I guess.

Okay.

We're getting close.

57:10.594 --> 57:13.304
I hate guys that buy $100,000 cars

57:13.430 --> 57:16.724
and then drive them around
10 miles slower than the speed limit.

57:19.394 --> 57:21.437
I hate guys who wear lady pants.

57:21.563 --> 57:23.064
Lady pants?

57:24.483 --> 57:25.566
Okay.

57:25.692 --> 57:29.028
I'm no mathematician,
but my odds are not good.

57:29.154 --> 57:33.282
Well, Pythagoras, it may be time to die.

57:35.452 --> 57:36.661
How'd that feel?

57:36.787 --> 57:38.871
It felt good.
It's a good night to die.

57:41.166 --> 57:43.126
VELOCitea Energy Drink.

57:43.252 --> 57:45.461
It's in your face.

57:47.673 --> 57:50.383
Frank, let me sleep in the chair.

57:50.509 --> 57:52.093
No, I'm all right.

57:52.219 --> 57:54.178
Come on. Sleep in the bed.

57:54.304 --> 57:56.013
You're the one
with the fucked-up headaches.

57:56.140 --> 57:59.600
No, this is good.

58:01.979 --> 58:07.191
Behold, the walls of Jericho!

58:08.360 --> 58:10.820
No, I'm fine.

58:10.946 --> 58:14.198
Jesus, Frank, get in bed
or I'm sleeping on the floor.

58:14.324 --> 58:16.951
I'm sleeping on the floor.
Here I go.

58:17.077 --> 58:18.327
Do you see this?

58:18.453 --> 58:19.495
I'm going down.

58:19.621 --> 58:21.998
Frank, it smells!

58:22.124 --> 58:24.917
I wouldn't trust that floor.

58:29.548 --> 58:31.382
Come on, Frank.

58:52.279 --> 58:54.864
What are we gonna do now?

58:54.990 --> 58:57.158
Well...

58:57.284 --> 58:59.118
What's our prime directive?

58:59.244 --> 59:03.164
I didn't have you pegged
as a "Star Trek" fan.

59:03.290 --> 59:05.583
What's that supposed to mean?

59:05.709 --> 59:09.086
I don't know.
I figured you more for...

59:09.213 --> 59:12.632
the new "Battlestar Galactica."

59:12.758 --> 59:15.468
Maybe some graphic novels.

59:15.594 --> 59:19.430
Bands like Fall Out Boy
and the Green Days.

59:19.556 --> 59:22.350
Oh, fuck you, Frank!

59:22.476 --> 59:25.102
I happen to like classic
and Next Gen "Star Trek."

59:25.229 --> 59:28.272
And I'm actually able to read
a book without pictures,

59:28.398 --> 59:30.775
thank you,
and I prefer the classics.

59:30.901 --> 59:31.943
I'm not ashamed to admit

59:32.069 --> 59:35.488
to the occasional Anne Rice
or "Harry Potter."

59:35.614 --> 59:40.826
Fall Out Boy and Green Day
suck shit through 10 bricks.

59:40.953 --> 59:44.413
Musically I'm all about Alice Cooper.

59:44.539 --> 59:46.999
I like Alice Cooper.

59:49.294 --> 59:51.295
You don't like Alice Cooper, Frank.

59:51.421 --> 59:55.633
That's... That's like a Muslim
saying that he likes Muhammad.

59:55.759 --> 59:57.343
You...

59:57.469 --> 01:00:00.388
accept Alice Cooper.

01:00:00.514 --> 01:00:04.392
You accept that Alice came down

01:00:04.518 --> 01:00:08.479
and gave us rock
that upset authority figures

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:13.276
and made the outcasts
not feel so all alone.

01:00:13.402 --> 01:00:16.946
You accept that there would be
no goth movement without Alice,

01:00:17.072 --> 01:00:20.032
no Trent Reznor,
no Marilyn Manson,

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:24.412
not even shitty soft cock-rockers
like Poison or Bon Jovi

01:00:24.538 --> 01:00:28.582
because not only did he introduce
macabre theatrics into rock,

01:00:28.709 --> 01:00:31.544
he also invented the power ballad

01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:35.464
with a little song called
"Only Women Bleed."

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:37.800
Okay, I get it.

01:00:37.926 --> 01:00:40.052
I promise I won't kill Alice Cooper.

01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:42.471
Hey, don't even joke about it, Frank.

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:46.309
Do you realize that he was
the first rock star to wear makeup?

01:00:46.435 --> 01:00:48.686
And he was wearing dresses

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:51.522
long before Bowie
stole his first pair of culottes

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:53.566
from his mother's clothesline.

01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:57.653
And he was screaming about death
and frustration way before punk,

01:00:57.779 --> 01:01:03.367
so I guess you have to accept
that Alice Cooper invented that, too.

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:06.579
Are you A. D. D., Juno?

01:01:06.705 --> 01:01:09.707
Yes, I have A. D. D.,

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:13.544
and don't you ever call me
fucking Juno again.

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:15.629
Sorry.

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:19.717
That's who we should kill next.

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:21.510
A fictitious character?

01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:23.387
No, Diablo Cody.

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:24.972
You know, fuck her
for writing that movie.

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:28.893
She's the only stripper who suffers
from too much self-esteem.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:30.102
I don't want to kill people

01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:32.229
just because
you don't like their movies.

01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:33.564
Why not?

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:35.858
She's encouraging teen pregnancy,

01:01:35.984 --> 01:01:38.527
her storylines and characters
are for shit,

01:01:38.653 --> 01:01:40.404
and she's just so excited

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.615
to throw any funny line she's heard
into the scene

01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:44.325
that she makes girls my age

01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:47.953
look like cutesy assholes
from a dirty Dr. Seuss book.

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:52.208
"Horton Hears a Star-Bellied Queef.
Blah."

01:01:52.334 --> 01:01:56.629
I only want to kill people
who deserve to die.

01:01:59.257 --> 01:02:01.175
You know who we should kill?

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:03.469
Mm?

01:02:03.595 --> 01:02:05.971
People who use "rock-star"
as an adjective.

01:02:06.098 --> 01:02:08.682
As in "rock-star parking"?

01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:11.435
Or people that pound
energy drinks all day.

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:16.065
People who use the term "edgy,"
"in-your-face," or "extreme."

01:02:16.191 --> 01:02:17.233
No, no, no, wait.

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:19.693
That would rule out a lot
of the chalupas that I love.

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:25.658
Anyone who wears crystals
or calls themselves "spiritual."

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:27.576
Or people who say "Namaste."

01:02:27.702 --> 01:02:29.245
What's that?

01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:31.914
It's an Indian greeting
the hippies stole.

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.291
Hippies!

01:02:34.418 --> 01:02:36.794
Anyone who buys an anarchy T-shirt.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:41.549
Or people that use the term "the man"
in a positive or negative light,

01:02:41.675 --> 01:02:44.260
as in, "The man is always
sticking it to us,"

01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:45.636
or "You're the man!"

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:48.639
- Anyone who's ever been "pumped."
- Or "stoked."

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:52.309
Anyone who gives and receives
physical high fives.

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:54.103
- Agreed.
- Oh, really?

01:02:54.229 --> 01:02:56.021
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

01:02:56.148 --> 01:02:58.691
Not gonna let you play the freedom
of speech here on my show, okay?

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:00.526
Okay? Let me explain
something to you.

01:03:00.652 --> 01:03:03.737
I would much rather lose
my rights to freedom of speech

01:03:03.864 --> 01:03:07.074
than ever have the A.C.I.U.
defend my right to freedom of speech.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.659
And another thing, you pinhead.

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:10.870
The A. C.I. U...
take heed, America...

01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:15.291
I think is more dangerous
to the United States than al-Qaeda.

01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:16.542
I'll give you a chance to respond

01:03:16.668 --> 01:03:18.169
if you have anything articulate to say
right after this.

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:19.336
More of the full story...

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:23.340
Anyone who makes a living
spreading fear to the masses.

01:03:23.467 --> 01:03:25.801
Or is just plain mean.

01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:27.178
Mm.

01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:30.097
So... our prime directive

01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:32.433
is to interfere
with the cultural evolution

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:35.144
of a pre-warp civilization.

01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:39.398
I got to go to sleep.
My head is killing me.

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:46.447
Stop it.

01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:48.491
What? I was trying
to help your headache.

01:03:48.617 --> 01:03:52.244
It's a pressure point.
I wasn't being sensual.

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:54.747
Yeah, people who use
the term "sensual."

01:03:54.873 --> 01:03:56.207
Gross.

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:58.209
You said it.

01:03:58.335 --> 01:03:59.793
Hey, Frank?

01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:04.715
Thanks for letting me
come along with you.

01:04:18.522 --> 01:04:20.105
Good night, Juno.

01:04:20.232 --> 01:04:21.732

We gonna do this or what?

01:05:50.822 --> 01:05:52.156
What do you think?

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:54.992
Looks good.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:58.495
Jesus, Frank,
you look like fuck pie.

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:41.705
Oh, there he is.

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:46.043
Ladies.

01:06:47.962 --> 01:06:50.005
I gotta get back to working out.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:00.057
Did we get him?

01:07:00.183 --> 01:07:02.351
No, I think we just winged him.

01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:11.694
Is he breathing?

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:15.447
I don't know.

01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:21.412
You stop moving or I shoot her.

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:23.163
You don't have the balls.

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:25.374
Really? I don't?

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.710
Fuck you,
you condescending prick!

01:07:27.836 --> 01:07:30.796
Why do you got to be so rude
all the time?

01:07:32.632 --> 01:07:35.676
Is that what this is all about?

My show?

01:07:38.388 --> 01:07:39.722
Shit.

01:07:39.848 --> 01:07:42.891
You must really hate my politics?

01:07:43.017 --> 01:07:46.770
Look, you kill me,
you just turn me into a martyr.

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:48.397
I don't hate your politics.

01:07:48.523 --> 01:07:51.316
In fact, I agree with you
on some things.

01:07:52.527 --> 01:07:54.862
- You do?
- Yeah.

01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:58.407
Then, what is this about?

01:07:58.533 --> 01:08:00.743
Why do you go to be
so mean all the time?

01:08:00.869 --> 01:08:05.622
Are you really willing to die
just because you don't think I'm nice?

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:08.041
Do you have it in you, Fuller?

01:08:08.168 --> 01:08:11.920
How long has it been since you
actually had to shoot someone?

01:08:12.046 --> 01:08:14.506
Oh, wait. You never have.

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:17.760
I forgot.
You never served in the military.

01:08:17.886 --> 01:08:20.679
You had your parents
help you dodge the draft

01:08:20.805 --> 01:08:22.973
just like every other rich blowhard

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:25.642
who makes a living
off of American xenophobes.

01:08:25.769 --> 01:08:28.562
It seems like you guys
just exploited some tragedies

01:08:28.688 --> 01:08:30.063
to further your agenda.

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:32.316
In fact, it seems like
it's always been about

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:37.529
protecting big oil companies' right
to keep boiling the whole world alive

01:08:37.654 --> 01:08:40.991
just because some
court-appointed, hillbilly president

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:43.535
started taking orders
from Jesus or the Easter Bunny

01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:46.078
or some other
make-'em-up play-friend of his.

01:08:46.206 --> 01:08:46.997
Please!

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:53.796
That is just your typical uneducated,
left-wing, "femonazi" point of view.

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:55.046
Feminazi.

01:08:55.173 --> 01:08:57.174
Again, why do you got to be so mean?

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:00.010
He just wishes
everyone would act nice.

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:02.554
I, on the other hand,
think your politics are shit.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.139
Well...

01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:10.854
You bitch!

01:09:11.856 --> 01:09:13.148
Yep.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.661
Exactly what part of his politics
do you agree with?

01:09:25.787 --> 01:09:28.412
Less gun control, of course.

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:32.459
But, Frank...
then every nut will have a gun.

01:09:50.728 --> 01:09:52.145
Look at all these people.

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:56.692
Yeah, I wish I had an AK-47.

01:10:00.238 --> 01:10:02.364
Bam.

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:05.492
Supporters of Michael Fuller
are calling him a hero,

01:10:05.618 --> 01:10:08.996
believing that his homicide is tied
to the outspoken support of the war

01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:10.205
and possibly the work

01:10:10.331 --> 01:10:13.041
of a terrorist sleeper cell
within our own borders.

01:10:13.167 --> 01:10:15.043
Fuller was right.

01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:17.921
He's a fucking martyr.

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:20.173
Fucking morons.

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:23.969
I don't care.
I'm just glad he's dead.

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:35.772
Is that your ex-wife?

01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:37.858
Yeah.

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:39.818
She's pretty.

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.279
Yep.

01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:46.825
I don't care if we're late.
I hate school!

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:52.456

01:10:55.877 --> 01:10:57.878
Yeah.

01:10:58.004 --> 01:10:59.504
You want to come say hi?

01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:02.341
School sucks!

01:11:02.467 --> 01:11:04.718
Nah. They look kind of busy.

01:11:08.389 --> 01:11:10.599
Who's your friend?

01:11:10.725 --> 01:11:12.392
A friend.

01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:19.816
Well, give us a call
if you decide to stay in town.

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:21.777
I'm sure the girls
would love to see ya.

01:11:21.903 --> 01:11:23.028
Yeah, thanks.

01:11:23.154 --> 01:11:25.906
Hey... don't tell 'em we were here,
al right?

01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:27.491
Oh, roger that.

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:30.869
Will you get Ava's backpack
from the house?

01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:32.746
Sure thing!

01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:34.581
I want my backpack.

01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:36.458
You're killing me, honey.
You're killing me!

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:39.920
So, are we gonna kill him?

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:42.339
No! Not that one!
I hate that one!

01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:43.924
I want my other one!

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:46.218
Just... Just get the blue one.
Get the blue one.

01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:47.928
Nah.

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:50.263
I want him to suffer.

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:16.915
Isn't it early for beer?

01:12:19.127 --> 01:12:22.087
This doesn't seem like the type of place
to order the Cognac.

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:25.173

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:28.301
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:12:30.221 --> 01:12:31.930
Give me your hand.

of new-age bullshi...

01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:49.823
Can't believe that's actually working.

I told you the truth, Sheriff.

01:16:51.565 --> 01:16:53.024
I didn't kill them.

01:16:53.150 --> 01:16:54.484

No.

Like, let's move to France

01:17:04.704 --> 01:17:08.623
or some other country
that hates Americans.

01:17:08.749 --> 01:17:11.543
Well, if we get caught later,
France wouldn't extradite us.

01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:14.045
And we could have
a cute, little French farm

01:17:14.171 --> 01:17:16.214
and raise cute, little French goats

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.758
and make cute, little French cheeses,

01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:23.346
and have a bunch of other
adorable, little French animals.

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:25.265
Sounds nice.

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:31.354
Here, give me your hand.

01:17:37.778 --> 01:17:40.405
I still can't believe that works.

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.159
Do you know
where you're going to?

01:17:44.285 --> 01:17:46.411
Well, we know where
Steven Clark is going to.

01:17:46.537 --> 01:17:48.079
The "American Superstarz"
performer

01:17:48.205 --> 01:17:50.665
has been asked to perform
on the live finale of the show

01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:53.251
after last week's failed attempt
to take his own life.

01:17:53.377 --> 01:17:54.669
Good news.

01:17:54.795 --> 01:17:57.213
We should kill all those people.

01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:00.550
They make fun of that guy
till he's ready to kill himself.

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:02.427
Then, they exploit him

01:18:02.553 --> 01:18:05.055
so everybody can feel better
about laughing at him

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:09.017
and pushing him over the edge
in the first place.

01:18:09.143 --> 01:18:11.895
I really hate this country.

01:18:12.021 --> 01:18:14.689
That's why we're moving to France.

01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:30.580

Hey, Doc, it's Frank Murdoch.
You left a message.

01:18:34.085 --> 01:18:36.336
Yes, I did, Frank.

01:18:36.462 --> 01:18:38.588
I have some bad news.

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:43.510
You don't have a brain tumor.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:45.595
What?!

01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:47.222
You're not gonna die.

01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:50.016
I don't understand.

01:18:50.142 --> 01:18:52.685
I mean, I saw the tumor.
You showed it to me.

01:18:52.812 --> 01:18:56.147
Yes, there was a tumor in an MRl,

01:18:56.273 --> 01:18:59.067
but that was Frank Burdoch with a "B",

01:18:59.193 --> 01:19:02.404
not Frank Murdoch with an "M".

01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:05.907
Wait, what is the bad news, then?

01:19:06.033 --> 01:19:09.202
Because this cocksucker Burdoch's
probably gonna sue me.

01:19:09.328 --> 01:19:11.371
He's a real ball-buster.
You know what I mean?

01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:14.624
But how come my head hurts
all the time, then?

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.376
I don't fucking know, Frank.

01:19:16.502 --> 01:19:18.837
I mean, maybe you sit
too close to the computer.

01:19:18.963 --> 01:19:21.798
Maybe you got high blood pressure.
Maybe you don't exercise enough.

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:24.717
Maybe it's, too much Viagra,
too much caffeine.

01:19:24.844 --> 01:19:26.136
What the fuck do I know?

01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:28.638
Hey, you're not gonna sue me,
are ya?

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:31.307
No, no.
No, I wouldn't do that, Doc.

01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:34.185
Well, that's a relief, Frank.

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:36.896
Well, hey,
thanks for the good news, Doc.

01:19:37.022 --> 01:19:38.857
Well, I got to go call
that cocksucker Burdoch now

01:19:38.983 --> 01:19:40.024
and tell him the bad news.

01:19:40.151 --> 01:19:42.777
You take care, Frank.

01:19:42.903 --> 01:19:45.655
Let's sell the car
and move to France.

01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:47.532
Really?

01:19:47.658 --> 01:19:49.409
Oh, I think it would be
très magnifique.

01:19:49.535 --> 01:19:51.786
I know a lot of French.
I know a lot of wines.

01:19:51.912 --> 01:19:54.914
I know how to ask where the library is.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.708
I know how to bum a cigarette.

01:19:56.834 --> 01:19:59.127
I know Oh là là, but that's about it.

01:19:59.253 --> 01:20:01.629
I know Oui.
What else could we need?

01:20:01.755 --> 01:20:03.298
Speaking of which, I have to wee.

01:20:03.424 --> 01:20:05.008
Oh, snap.

01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:11.598
Hey, buddy.

01:20:11.724 --> 01:20:13.057
What's up with the girl?

01:20:13.184 --> 01:20:14.225
Pardon?

01:20:14.351 --> 01:20:16.186
I know she's not your daughter.

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:19.272
I can tell by the way
she makes you smile.

01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:20.565
She's my niece.

01:20:20.691 --> 01:20:24.194
Yeah, I got a lot of nieces.

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.362
How much for a date?

01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:31.117
I think you got the wrong idea, sir.

01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:33.703
Yeah, you stick to that story.

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:35.955
I don't think I do.

01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:37.373
You have a good one.

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.167
I know you're gonna have a good day.

01:20:39.293 --> 01:20:40.418
God bless.

01:20:44.632 --> 01:20:46.591
Hey, don't use up
all the hot water this time.

01:20:46.717 --> 01:20:47.800
I won't!

01:20:47.927 --> 01:20:50.386
God, you better not be
this uptight in France.

01:20:51.764 --> 01:20:53.139
You don't have to shower in France.

01:21:13.452 --> 01:21:15.161
We'd like to take this chance

01:21:15.287 --> 01:21:18.957
to thank everybody in our community
and the media

01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:23.169
for helping us in our search
for Roxanne.

01:21:23.295 --> 01:21:26.631
We pray that she's still alive
and that she makes it home to us.

01:21:26.757 --> 01:21:30.093
Roxanne, we miss you
and we love you.

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:32.178
Anyone with any information on the...

01:21:32.304 --> 01:21:34.722
God fuckin' damn it!

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:01.708
You son of a bitch!

01:22:01.834 --> 01:22:03.418
Get off me!

01:22:31.905 --> 01:22:34.198
Frank?

01:22:34.325 --> 01:22:36.784
Is that you?

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:41.414
What happened?

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:43.625
- Your parents!
- What?

01:22:43.751 --> 01:22:45.168
Yeah, I just saw 'em on the TV.

01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:46.878
You lied to me!

01:22:47.004 --> 01:22:49.213
Well, would you have taken me along

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:52.050
if I told you
that I lived in a normal house

01:22:52.176 --> 01:22:55.678
with a set of normal parents
who didn't abuse me

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:58.931
but also didn't even try
and understand me?

01:22:59.058 --> 01:23:04.395
That every day in my normal life
felt like a million years?

01:23:04.521 --> 01:23:09.442
And that I spent all day, every day,
being told what to do and what to think

01:23:09.568 --> 01:23:12.195
by people who I'm
a million times smarter than,

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:14.781
but since it's not polite
to acknowledge that,

01:23:14.907 --> 01:23:17.659
I just had to pretend to listen to?

01:23:17.785 --> 01:23:22.038
That every single morning,
I just woke up and wished

01:23:22.164 --> 01:23:26.250
that anything not normal
would happen?

01:23:26.377 --> 01:23:27.877
Here are the keys to that car.

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:29.337
Where am I supposed to go?

01:23:29.463 --> 01:23:31.381
I don't care!
Go back to your parents.

01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:33.508
Just stay out of my life.

01:23:33.634 --> 01:23:34.884
I don't got time for you!

01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:38.179
You're just like everybody else.
I don't got time for liars!

01:23:38.305 --> 01:23:39.389
Oh, fuck you, Frank!

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:41.599
You're just a pathetic, broken man!

01:23:45.562 --> 01:23:47.814

Frank, you didn't really tell me

01:25:42.095 --> 01:25:43.805
exactly what you were looking for
when you called,

01:25:43.931 --> 01:25:46.599
so I brought you kind of
a gun pupu platter.

01:25:53.357 --> 01:25:56.734
We got your .357 Magnum.

01:25:56.860 --> 01:26:00.446
Nickel finish, six shots,
eight-inch barrel.

01:26:00.572 --> 01:26:04.367
It's .357, so you know
it's got some punch to it.

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:06.410
You put this to the back
of some nigger's head,

01:26:06.537 --> 01:26:08.621
all you're gonna see is pink mist.

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:13.292
No, maybe not.
Maybe not for you.

01:26:14.378 --> 01:26:16.003
Old school.

01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:17.755
Walther P38.

01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:22.510
German, nine-millimeter,
made during the second World War.

01:26:22.636 --> 01:26:25.596
I mean, who knows how to kill people
better than Germans, right?

01:26:25.722 --> 01:26:26.889
You know it's got to be good.

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:28.182
You're not a Jew, Frank, are you?

01:26:28.308 --> 01:26:30.726
I'm just asking 'cause, you know,
I brought up a German gun.

01:26:30.853 --> 01:26:32.812
Okay, hey, maybe,

01:26:32.938 --> 01:26:36.691
maybe you're looking for something
that's a little bigger.

01:26:36.817 --> 01:26:37.984
Little more firepower.

01:26:38.110 --> 01:26:42.530
See what we got
that may strike your fancy here.

01:26:47.744 --> 01:26:49.662
Is that a honey or what?

01:26:53.417 --> 01:26:54.834
AK-47.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.503
When you absolutely, positively
have to waste

01:26:57.629 --> 01:26:59.755
every single motherfucker
in the room,

01:26:59.882 --> 01:27:01.591
accept no substitute.

01:27:02.718 --> 01:27:05.177
I can see you like this.
Definitely.

01:27:05.304 --> 01:27:07.179
7.62 x 39.

01:27:07.306 --> 01:27:10.391
It's an assault rifle,
but it's still light.

01:27:10.517 --> 01:27:11.767
And talk about reliable?

01:27:11.894 --> 01:27:13.853
Frank, I could throw this off the roof.

01:27:13.979 --> 01:27:15.605
I could run this over with my car.

01:27:15.731 --> 01:27:20.401
I could bury it in the dirt
and dig it up, and it'll still fire.

01:27:20.527 --> 01:27:22.403
That's how reliable that is.

01:27:22.529 --> 01:27:25.364
Best mass-produced
combat weapon ever made.

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:26.616
Look at this. That fits you.

01:27:26.742 --> 01:27:28.159
Look at this.
You're friggin' Rambo, man!

01:27:28.285 --> 01:27:30.369
Look at that. Look. I love it!

01:27:30.495 --> 01:27:32.288
You know what?
You don't even have to aim this thing.

01:27:32.414 --> 01:27:35.374
It's a spray-and-pray
kind of weapon.

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:36.751
I mean, what's better than that, right?

01:27:36.877 --> 01:27:39.503
Now, the one thing is
this is not a cheap weapon.

01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:40.838
This is an assault rifle,

01:27:40.964 --> 01:27:43.466
so we're looking
around two grand for this.

01:27:43.592 --> 01:27:45.134
So, I don't know
if that's in your budget,

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:46.552
but what I will do,

01:27:46.678 --> 01:27:49.555
I got three fully loaded
30-round mags in here

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:52.058
that I will throw in for that $2,000.

01:27:52.184 --> 01:27:53.768
That's a steal.

01:27:53.894 --> 01:27:55.978
For a weapon of that quality, you know.

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:58.147
This something you can afford?

01:27:58.273 --> 01:27:59.899
Yeah, I want the case, too.

01:28:00.025 --> 01:28:01.817
Oh, grea... Hey, great!
You know what?

01:28:01.944 --> 01:28:04.820
Is there anything else I can get you
while we're talking about the gun?

01:28:04.947 --> 01:28:06.489

Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment we've all been waiting for.

01:30:28.173 --> 01:30:31.133

the weakest in our society

01:37:32.639 --> 01:37:35.724

01:37:35.850 --> 01:37:39.853
