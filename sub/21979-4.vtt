13:42.465 --> 13:43.464
"rah!" With his sai.

13:43.465 --> 13:46.464
And my other brother Donny hacks
the bad guys' computers--

13:46.465 --> 13:47.464
he's smart like that.

13:47.465 --> 13:51.464
And Leo--he's our fearless
leader!

13:51.465 --> 13:53.464
Heh, not me...

13:53.465 --> 13:55.464
- Dude! Your brothers sound
awesome.

13:55.465 --> 13:57.464
- Yeah, they are.

13:57.465 --> 13:59.464
Even after I trash the house.

13:59.465 --> 14:01.464
- My brothers just pick on me.

14:01.465 --> 14:04.464
Sorry I wasn't entirely, totally
true back there.

14:04.465 --> 14:06.464
[Sigh]

14:06.465 --> 14:08.464
- It's all good, Napoleon.

14:08.465 --> 14:10.464
- Let go of me, creep!

14:10.465 --> 14:11.464
- Silence, human!

14:11.465 --> 14:14.464
- That sounded like April!

14:14.465 --> 14:17.464
- Ah!
- Gah!

14:17.465 --> 14:20.464
- Help!

14:20.465 --> 14:22.464
- Hey! What is this?

14:22.465 --> 14:23.464
What are you doing
to my friends?

14:23.465 --> 14:26.464
- Friends? You said these humans
were terrible to you.

14:26.465 --> 14:29.464
You escaped.
- Oh. Ha.

14:29.465 --> 14:31.464
That's not exactly what I meant.
See--

14:31.465 --> 14:36.464
- this human lover lied to
become accepted by us.

14:36.465 --> 14:38.464
- Live with humans,

14:38.465 --> 14:40.464
suffer with humans!

14:40.465 --> 14:42.464
- Ah! Hey!

14:42.465 --> 14:43.464
Let me go!

14:43.465 --> 14:45.464
- No! He's my friend, you can't!

14:45.465 --> 14:48.464
- I told you never to trust
a turtle.

14:48.465 --> 14:50.464
That turtle is a traitor.

14:50.465 --> 14:52.464
- Your mom is a traitor.

14:52.465 --> 14:56.464
- Science teaches us that
humans are inferior.

14:56.465 --> 14:58.465
To disagree is heresy, Napoleon!

15:01.549 --> 15:03.464
- Idiots.

15:03.465 --> 15:07.464
- Ah! Why can't we all
just get along?

15:07.465 --> 15:08.464
- Why?

15:08.465 --> 15:11.464
You dare to ask why?

15:11.465 --> 15:14.464
There was once a time when we,
the amphibians,

15:14.465 --> 15:16.464
ruled these lands.

15:16.465 --> 15:19.464
We frolicked in the woods and
the trees and the swamplands.

15:19.465 --> 15:25.464
Until they, the humans, arrived,
with their metal monsters.

15:25.465 --> 15:28.464
They needed more strip malls!
More gas stations!

15:28.465 --> 15:30.464
More coffee shops!

15:30.465 --> 15:35.464
And one day...These woods will
disappear as well.

15:35.465 --> 15:38.464
There will be nothing.

15:38.465 --> 15:41.464
Fortunately, Rasputin discovered
a gift

15:41.465 --> 15:44.464
in a puddle below this tree.

15:44.465 --> 15:48.464
The sacred ooze!

15:48.465 --> 15:50.464
- [Gasps]
Mutagen!

15:50.465 --> 15:52.464
- The time for revolution
is now!

15:52.465 --> 15:54.464
We shall invade their cities.

15:54.465 --> 15:59.464
With this "mutagen" we will
create a bigger family.

15:59.465 --> 16:03.464
The age of humans is at an end.
We shall rise!

16:03.465 --> 16:06.464
[Cheering]

16:06.465 --> 16:09.464
- You gotta listen!
You can't do that!

16:09.465 --> 16:13.465
- Frog soldiers! Assemble!

16:18.465 --> 16:24.464
- All: Frogs rule! Frogs rule!
Frogs rule! Frogs rule!

16:24.465 --> 16:25.465
Frogs rule!

16:27.953 --> 16:29.952
- Frog soldiers!

16:29.953 --> 16:32.953
These lives will once
again be ours!

16:35.953 --> 16:36.952
- Here's the plan.

16:36.953 --> 16:38.952
We wait for the army to leave,
free the guys,

16:38.953 --> 16:39.952
then stop the invasion.

16:39.953 --> 16:41.952
- Perfect.
[Branch breaking]

16:41.953 --> 16:42.952
- Not so perfect!

16:42.953 --> 16:44.952
Wah-ow!

16:44.953 --> 16:46.952
Heh. Awkward.

16:46.953 --> 16:47.952
- Genghis!

16:47.953 --> 16:49.952
- Destroy him.

16:49.953 --> 16:51.952
- Eat it, froggy!

16:51.953 --> 16:53.953
- Guys! Yes!
Go ninjas!

17:18.953 --> 17:19.953
- Little help, guys?

17:35.953 --> 17:41.952
- Wah!
Ah!

17:41.953 --> 17:42.952
- Get us outta here, Napoleon!

17:42.953 --> 17:45.952
I gotta totally go ninja on
their butts!

17:45.953 --> 17:49.952
- Sometimes, a frog's gotta do
what a frog's gotta do.

17:49.953 --> 17:52.952
Whoa!
Ugh!

17:52.953 --> 17:56.952
- Where do you think you're
going, Napoleon?

17:56.953 --> 18:00.953
- I think I'm going...
Ninja on your butt!

18:07.953 --> 18:08.952
- Sweet ninja moves, Napoleon!

18:08.953 --> 18:11.953
- I learned them from the second
best warrior I know.

18:13.953 --> 18:15.952
[Fighting]

18:15.953 --> 18:17.952
- Get off of me, punks!

18:17.953 --> 18:18.952
Rah!

18:18.953 --> 18:20.952
- Goodbye, traitor!

18:20.953 --> 18:22.952
- Hiya!

18:22.953 --> 18:26.952
- Mikey!

18:26.953 --> 18:27.952
- What are you doing, dude?

18:27.953 --> 18:29.952
- Hugging, I think.

18:29.953 --> 18:32.952
- It's...Weird.

18:32.953 --> 18:35.952
- Yeah. Let's never do that
again.

18:35.953 --> 18:37.952
- Wah!

18:37.953 --> 18:39.952
[Fighting]

18:39.953 --> 18:41.953
- Oh no! Fire! Fire!

18:44.953 --> 18:48.952
- The tree is on fire!
We must totally flee!

18:48.953 --> 18:50.952
- Wah!
- Ooh!

18:50.953 --> 18:53.952
- Napoleon's right.
Run!

18:53.953 --> 18:56.952
- Come on, everyone.
This way.

18:56.953 --> 18:58.952
- Do not flee, my frogs.

18:58.953 --> 19:01.952
Stand and fight against the
humans and their allies--

19:01.953 --> 19:04.952
- don't take this the wrong way,
Attila buddy.

19:04.953 --> 19:05.952
- [Grunts]

19:05.953 --> 19:09.953
- Come on, red! Let's blow this
flaming tree house!

19:11.953 --> 19:13.952
[Frogs screaming]
- Everyone hurry!

19:13.953 --> 19:16.953
- Flee!
- Our home!

19:23.953 --> 19:27.952
- What? Humans?
Saving me?

19:27.953 --> 19:28.952
- Not all humans are bad.

19:28.953 --> 19:32.953
And I'd like to believe not all
mutated frogs are bad, Attila.

19:34.953 --> 19:37.953
- [Sobbing]

19:38.953 --> 19:43.953
- The horror. The horror.

19:53.953 --> 19:55.953
- My frogs! To me!

20:00.953 --> 20:03.952
Attila the frog has never been
wrong about anything

20:03.953 --> 20:07.952
in his life.

20:07.953 --> 20:11.952
But perhaps I have been a bit
hasty...

20:11.953 --> 20:14.952
About these humans.

20:14.953 --> 20:20.952
Frogs, line up behind
your general.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.952
- Huh?

20:22.953 --> 20:24.952
- What the heck
is going on here?

20:24.953 --> 20:28.952
- You, Napoleon, were the only
frog to show wisdom

20:28.953 --> 20:30.952
regarding these turtles
and humans.

20:30.953 --> 20:34.952
You are brave, stalwart,
and have a good heart.

20:34.953 --> 20:37.952
And so I promote you to general!

20:37.953 --> 20:40.952
- This is pretty much the best
position ever!

20:40.953 --> 20:43.952
- Stupid bug-eyed kid is
general.

20:43.953 --> 20:44.952
- What was that, genghis?

20:44.953 --> 20:47.952
- Uh, nothing, sir.

20:47.953 --> 20:50.952
- Perhaps there is a future
where frogs, turtles,

20:50.953 --> 20:54.952
and revolting humans can live
together in harmony.

20:54.953 --> 20:56.952
- What about your home?
Where you gonna go?

20:56.953 --> 21:01.952
- Down South. We have like
20,000 cousins in Louisiana.

21:01.953 --> 21:05.952
I got you some delicious flies.

21:05.953 --> 21:06.952
- Aw!
- Ew!

21:06.953 --> 21:09.952
- Let me see if I have
something for you.

21:09.953 --> 21:12.952
- Ooh! Nice and warm!

21:12.953 --> 21:14.952
- Mm. Mm, thanks!

21:14.953 --> 21:18.952
Frogs, march!
Hop-two-three-four...

21:18.953 --> 21:21.952
Goodbye, Michelangelo!
See ya!

21:21.953 --> 21:23.952
- Goodbye, Napoleon!

21:23.953 --> 21:27.952
There goes one brave frog.

21:27.953 --> 21:28.952
- You know what?

21:28.953 --> 21:30.952
It's good to have you back, bro.

21:30.953 --> 21:32.952
- It's good to be back, bros.

21:32.953 --> 21:34.952
- Let's go home.

21:34.953 --> 21:37.953
We have a lot of
cleaning up to do.
