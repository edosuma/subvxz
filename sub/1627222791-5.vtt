00:00.720 --> 00:04.280
This program contains violence and
very strong language.

00:10.440 --> 00:12.680
I am not the chosen one.

00:12.720 --> 00:14.960
I choose this myself!

00:15.000 --> 00:17.160
Hello, squirt.

00:17.200 --> 00:20.440
There is one that comes
from the east.

00:20.480 --> 00:22.760
He brought with him a spear.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.200
Only once the spear is found

00:25.240 --> 00:28.280
can the chosen one
lead us into the light.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.200
Excited. Raring to go.

00:31.240 --> 00:36.600
Eeny meeny miny moe...

00:36.640 --> 00:39.880
I caught a Druid by the toe.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.360
Kneel General Aulus.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.880
Find the spear before Rome.

01:33.880 --> 01:35.800
Is this your house?

01:37.520 --> 01:38.840
For now.

01:38.880 --> 01:41.280
It smells different to home.

01:42.440 --> 01:43.440
Our home.

01:48.440 --> 01:49.560
Are you a general?

01:51.560 --> 01:52.600
I am.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.800
Have you conquered many lands?

01:57.960 --> 01:59.800
I have.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.400
Are you proud?

02:05.000 --> 02:08.080
I, uh...
General Aulus Plautius...

02:11.880 --> 02:13.000
...have you missed me?

02:17.680 --> 02:19.200
Every day.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.080
Are you sorry
for what you did?

02:33.000 --> 02:36.080
The greatest sacrifice
is the one that hurts the most.

02:37.080 --> 02:41.240
It hurts you more to survive.
I didn't ask if it hurts.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.000
I asked if you were sorry.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.840
Are you sorry?

02:47.840 --> 02:50.120
Are you sorry, Father?

02:58.320 --> 02:59.560
No.

03:01.320 --> 03:03.280
Because you love him.

03:04.160 --> 03:05.920
With all my heart.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.280
I had a dream last night.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.400
I was wandering
over a great mountain.

03:20.280 --> 03:24.320
The way was lonely... quiet.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.640
I came across a temple.

03:27.680 --> 03:32.240
I went inside into a tower
with high windows.

03:33.200 --> 03:36.960
It was a plain temple
with a plain altar,

03:37.000 --> 03:40.640
and upon it was a cross
like this.

03:40.680 --> 03:44.480
A plain wooden cross.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.480
And from the centre
of the cross shone light,

03:47.520 --> 03:49.640
pure light.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.600
What can it mean?

03:53.080 --> 03:54.920
Why have you come to me?

03:56.800 --> 03:59.600
You know, that's
the first sign of madness,

03:59.640 --> 04:00.960
talking to yourself.

04:02.560 --> 04:03.960
Don't let me interrupt you.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.160
You're shaking like a child.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.160
Get out.

04:10.200 --> 04:13.040
What'd he say
if he could hear you now?

04:13.080 --> 04:14.280
On your knees.

04:14.320 --> 04:18.600
Do not... play with me.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.520
Hello.

04:27.840 --> 04:30.480
Why don't you come with me? Come on.

04:30.520 --> 04:34.960
Ooh! How lovely.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.720
♪ Yeah!

04:52.280 --> 04:56.080
♪ Well, you can bump and grind

04:56.120 --> 04:59.360
♪ It is good for your mind

04:59.400 --> 05:03.200
♪ Well, you can twist and shout

05:03.240 --> 05:05.360
♪ Let it all hang out

05:05.400 --> 05:10.440
♪ But you won't fool
the children of the revolution

05:10.480 --> 05:27.240
♪ No, you won't fool
the children of the revolution

05:27.280 --> 05:28.640
♪ No way!

05:30.880 --> 05:31.880
♪ Yeah!

05:42.160 --> 05:43.840
♪ Whoa! ♪

05:47.960 --> 05:50.160
Oh, no.

05:50.200 --> 05:51.720
Met before?

05:51.760 --> 05:54.440
Briefly. She kidnapped me.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.040
She buried me alive.

05:56.080 --> 05:59.160
Not that it's a competition,
but I had to stitch my lung back in

05:59.200 --> 06:01.240
with fresh bear guts.

06:01.280 --> 06:04.040
I like her already.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.040
Can't we just find this Lucius
on our own?

06:06.080 --> 06:07.760
Shut it, Quant.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.800
Who's looking for the
deserter?

06:09.840 --> 06:11.400
I am.

06:11.440 --> 06:12.920
I remember you.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.880
Where's the gold?

06:14.920 --> 06:17.680
On the horse.

06:17.720 --> 06:21.920
Aren't you gonna count it?
Veran knows better than to twice me.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.760
The Romans send deserters
to the front line.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.720
This man you're looking for, he's in
a prison camp up in the Blue Hills.

06:26.760 --> 06:27.880
Five days west.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.880
The deal was you take us to him.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.040
Not west.

06:31.080 --> 06:32.440
West is too dangerous, no.

06:32.480 --> 06:35.040
I have displaced deserters.
My sister will take you.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.040
Sister? What sister?

06:40.240 --> 06:42.560
Name's Drella.
She knows the paths west.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.440
Hella and Drella.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.600
Pay for Hella, get Drella.

06:58.480 --> 06:59.760
That's our guide?

07:01.720 --> 07:03.520
Morning, Drella.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.000
Ooh, it's a nasty scab there.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.320
Explain something to me.

07:06.360 --> 07:09.400
Going west
is too dangerous for you,

07:09.440 --> 07:10.560
but not for her.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.960
Not for your own sister?
Who falls for that?

07:13.000 --> 07:17.840
Who's stupid enough to swap
four bags of sand, for that.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.480
I don't like her much.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.920
Take it or leave it.
We'll take it.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.560
Mistake.
It's a massive mistake.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.160
No, I'm fine with it.
Anyone but her.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.400
Word of warning,
she doesn't do small talk.

07:29.440 --> 07:30.800
Also, don't get downwind of her.

07:30.840 --> 07:32.520
And if she gets angry, run.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.080
Got it. Thank you, Hella.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.520
Really?

07:40.560 --> 07:42.280
Unbelievable.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.120
Keep an eye out.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.560
Not that one.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.760
Not that one. Keep going.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.160
That one.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.360
I know what it is, but it is.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.920
Hey. I still can't
piss straight!

08:09.800 --> 08:11.720
What do you know
of the Blue Hill tribes?

08:11.760 --> 08:13.120
You mean before the invasion?

08:13.160 --> 08:15.880
Hmm... let me see,
it's been a while.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.320
The demonic were difficult,

08:18.360 --> 08:20.960
The Belgie were a laugh
when pissed.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.280
But then watch your back
when the moon is out.

08:23.320 --> 08:26.680
Blue Mountain tribes
were always a headache.

08:26.720 --> 08:29.520
The slightest beef and they
burn each other's homes.

08:29.560 --> 08:32.480
I swear, there's something
in the water up there.

08:32.520 --> 08:33.880
So this spear,

08:33.920 --> 08:36.400
just imagine you're talking
to a total idiot.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.640
The prophecy says the spear
will come from the east

08:38.680 --> 08:40.880
and the Chosen One will unite
the tribes against Lokka.

08:40.920 --> 08:42.040
Free them from his spell.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.280
Excellent. Got all that, yep.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.160
So, when this Lucius
packed his stuff

08:46.200 --> 08:48.480
to come and invade us, was it...

08:49.560 --> 08:52.760
Was it sandals, cloak, tunic,
helmet, spear?

08:52.800 --> 08:54.920
Or was it sandals, cloak,
tunic, helmet,

08:54.960 --> 08:57.360
spear of the silver dawn?

08:57.400 --> 08:58.960
What do you mean?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.800
So, what's the secret?

09:02.440 --> 09:04.680
I mean,
I smell pretty ghastly,

09:04.720 --> 09:06.560
but this...

09:06.600 --> 09:07.880
Whoo!

09:07.920 --> 09:09.560
This is next level.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.120
All the classic notes are there.

09:11.160 --> 09:13.120
The dungs, the moulds.

09:13.160 --> 09:15.680
Six or seven dead mammals.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.760
I'm not a betting man,
but if you stood on my chest-

09:17.800 --> 09:20.200
Is that stoat?
Think about it.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.240
You had no idea

09:22.280 --> 09:23.640
we were even over here.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.920
Or that we were waiting
for a spear.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.000
Yes. You agree with me,
don't you?

09:28.040 --> 09:30.600
Other than a drum or a hat

09:30.640 --> 09:32.400
or a cat?

09:32.440 --> 09:34.200
See what I mean?

09:34.240 --> 09:35.520
Yes.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.840
Badger, that's a given.

09:37.880 --> 09:39.000
Dead man?

09:39.040 --> 09:40.960
Different dead man.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.720
Much, much deader man,
but that...

09:47.360 --> 09:49.120
...it's fucking genius.
What even is that?

09:49.160 --> 09:51.360
Servants of the Prophecy
do not always comprehend

09:51.400 --> 09:52.760
the implore of their actions.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.760
If you like choices then...
Ah, I've got it.

09:54.800 --> 09:57.920
Are whispers of the gods'
ancient winds

09:57.960 --> 09:59.120
blowing across time.

09:59.160 --> 10:00.400
Way ahead of you there. Yeah.

10:00.440 --> 10:02.600
Mind, though, my question...
Your question is,

10:02.640 --> 10:05.440
does Lucius know his purpose,

10:06.800 --> 10:07.960
or is he as lost as you?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.720
Thank you.
Yeah.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.680
You don't even know her, do you?

10:14.520 --> 10:19.080
She found you around the corner
and just flipped you.
With full bags of jury gold.

10:19.960 --> 10:23.840
Meanwhile, we are walking
into the Blue Mountains blind.

10:23.880 --> 10:26.840
You know what,
whoever is waiting for us,

10:26.880 --> 10:28.320
they know we're coming.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.440
They can smell us from here.

11:00.880 --> 11:04.440
Lucius may not know his purpose,
but he knew he had one.

11:05.320 --> 11:06.520
He knew.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.680
If we listen hard,
we can hear the wind song.

11:09.720 --> 11:12.800
Thanks, Rayne.
But if I'm completely honest,

11:12.840 --> 11:14.080
that hasn't helped.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.760
Here we go.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.080
Which way?

11:29.040 --> 11:30.400
In your own time.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.320
She said you know the path.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.800
She did.

11:36.720 --> 11:38.520
That's what she said.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.120
Do you know the path?

11:44.920 --> 11:46.440
What are these?

11:47.920 --> 11:50.080
It's the Sun folk,
but these aren't their hills.

11:52.040 --> 11:53.640
It must have been displaced.

11:56.920 --> 11:58.880
Oh, come on.

11:58.920 --> 12:01.280
Well, that way
doesn't look too inviting.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.560
Could be Sun folk,
maybe Coritani.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.320
Which is worse?

12:06.360 --> 12:07.760
Both.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.280
But the Sun folk
respect Veran.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.120
Or used to.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.840
But we can't just
barrel in there.

12:13.880 --> 12:15.240
We need a closer look.

12:15.280 --> 12:16.760
I'll go.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.360
I'll follow the red trees.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.920
Tell the Sun folk our purpose.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.440
They can tell us
the safest way,

12:21.480 --> 12:24.880
and if I don't return,
go the other way.

12:24.920 --> 12:26.360
It's a plan.

14:11.560 --> 14:13.160
The lowlands are cursed.

14:14.440 --> 14:16.360
Roman devils roam there.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.560
The high hills will bear
the Chosen One on wood.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.120
Come nearer, child.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.960
There is heavy weight upon you.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.160
I... do not want to fail
the Chosen One.

14:43.320 --> 14:47.280
Follow the high hills.
They will bear her safely on.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.840
The high hills.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.560
Thank you, sisters.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.200
Dixon. Hey.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.080
I'll loosen it. Yeah?

15:21.040 --> 15:23.760
I don't need it.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.800
Sorry.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.200
It's my job.

15:32.760 --> 15:35.040
How's that?

15:35.080 --> 15:37.040
Too tight?

15:37.080 --> 15:38.240
I'll manage.

15:43.960 --> 15:47.000
One more night, and those two
are knocking boots.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.120
No, he's immaculate.

15:49.160 --> 15:51.520
Immaculates are forbidden
to even think such thoughts.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.280
So, he's a virgin?

15:53.320 --> 15:56.240
Of course he's a virgin.
I mean, look at him.

15:57.440 --> 15:59.800
I'm not getting virgin.

15:59.840 --> 16:02.280
Cocksure, maybe.
No, no, no.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.360
Not cocksure.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.840
Annoying. All immaculates
are annoying.

16:05.880 --> 16:09.080
Him, especially.
He's an annoying

16:09.120 --> 16:11.400
cocky version.
Well, I can't see it.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.080
You, however...

16:16.480 --> 16:18.000
I'm right, aren't I?

16:19.600 --> 16:21.680
How's... How is that relevant?

16:21.720 --> 16:22.760
I mean, how could...

16:22.800 --> 16:24.680
How could you possibly
just breathe from...

16:32.360 --> 16:33.760
What did
the Sun folks say?

16:38.880 --> 16:40.120
The high hills...

16:46.600 --> 16:48.000
The high hills are too dangerous.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.680
We must take the lowland way.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.640
I disagree.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.480
Why?
My gut.

16:55.520 --> 16:57.000
My gut says it's the wrong path.

16:59.160 --> 17:00.200
Your gut?

17:02.200 --> 17:05.240
My gut.
Is this the same guy you had
to stitch back in with a bear's?

17:05.280 --> 17:07.400
Should we have a vote?
Okay, just stop it.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.400
Just stop. Everybody stop.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.040
May I ask a question here?

17:11.080 --> 17:13.840
Does vast experience
and monumental wisdom

17:13.880 --> 17:18.000
count for nothing in this band?
Or is it just a free for all?

17:18.040 --> 17:20.960
Does my opinion count
as much as this bucks

17:21.000 --> 17:22.200
or this prancing pony

17:22.240 --> 17:25.120
or that mute dung heap
we just got saddled with?

17:26.440 --> 17:28.760
The Sun folk were clear.

17:30.560 --> 17:31.960
It's decided.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Let's move.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.280
You all right?

17:38.120 --> 17:39.640
Fuck's sake.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.720
Last night was fun.
Wasn't it?

18:05.760 --> 18:08.640
You played that witch
to perfection.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.760
I was jealous.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.680
How did she get her inside?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.160
I'm fascinated.

18:15.200 --> 18:18.040
Simple. We both want
to kill your husband.

18:18.080 --> 18:20.600
I'm on fire for revenge,
aren't I?

18:20.640 --> 18:21.880
For what he did
to my daughter.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.440
Perfect.

18:23.480 --> 18:24.680
Who could forgive that?

18:24.720 --> 18:26.680
Of course,
what she didn't know is,

18:26.720 --> 18:28.760
I don't really blame him.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.240
Genius.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.760
Veran's going to pay
for what he did to my family.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.560
But I need help with that.

18:37.320 --> 18:39.440
I want what Lokka wants.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.920
It's why I'm so lucky you came.

18:41.960 --> 18:44.840
You know I'm strong.
Not like Aulus.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.720
I'll do anything you ask.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.480
Uh, go on!

19:10.800 --> 19:12.840
Little pig.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.480
Little pig.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.040
Can I come in?

19:26.400 --> 19:27.640
Well...

19:30.560 --> 19:33.360
My husband
thought it was tough.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.280
"God, it's tough," he said.

19:35.320 --> 19:38.520
I thought it was going
to be tough. Chewy.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.080
Mmm.

19:48.640 --> 19:49.880
But it wasn't.

19:50.880 --> 19:54.800
It was... tender.

19:54.840 --> 19:55.960
Flavoursome.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.440
But as it turns out,

19:58.480 --> 20:00.000
quite thick.

20:01.520 --> 20:05.600
Quite dim
for Veran's right-hand man.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.960
Here's what I want you to do.

20:18.560 --> 20:21.240
I'm going to go now,

20:21.280 --> 20:24.880
and then I'm gonna come back
in the morning light.

20:24.920 --> 20:27.240
In the meantime,

20:27.280 --> 20:30.600
I want you to dig down

20:30.640 --> 20:33.480
and think of the cleverest thing
you can think of.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.320
Something to get...

20:37.360 --> 20:38.920
Right inside this!

20:39.720 --> 20:41.880
Deep inside!

20:44.760 --> 20:48.600
What's the very last thing
Veran wants?

20:51.720 --> 20:54.280
So anyway,
back to this spear.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.080
It came from the East.

20:56.120 --> 20:58.400
Where in the East?
The East is a big place.

20:58.440 --> 21:00.640
What was it doing there?
Who did it belong to?

21:00.680 --> 21:03.320
Is it long, short,
bronze, iron?

21:04.240 --> 21:07.080
A close call to battle
or range attack?

21:07.120 --> 21:09.440
Is it a javelin?

21:09.480 --> 21:11.520
Harpoon? Rapier?

21:11.560 --> 21:12.760
A pike!

21:13.720 --> 21:16.200
Trident!
The prophecy does not say.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.080
Ha, there's a surprise.

21:18.120 --> 21:19.640
It only states that
the spear was used

21:19.680 --> 21:21.520
to slay a powerful Druid.

21:21.560 --> 21:24.400
A Druid?
He was a threat
to the kings of the land.

21:24.440 --> 21:26.560
The kings tied the Druid
to a tree.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.280
What are you doing?
And he...

21:28.320 --> 21:30.240
What?

21:30.280 --> 21:33.520
The prophecy of Veran
is on a need to know basis.

21:33.560 --> 21:37.040
This prat, trust me,
doesn't need to know.

21:38.600 --> 21:41.240
And for your information,
it wasn't a tree.

21:42.320 --> 21:43.880
It was a cross.

21:53.040 --> 21:54.320
Stop!

22:10.560 --> 22:12.000
It's the trees talking.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.520
Circle them!

22:29.880 --> 22:31.040
Halt!

22:33.400 --> 22:35.160
Excellent. Perfect.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.640
So, anyone know just anything

22:36.680 --> 22:38.880
about the fucking Roman jerk?

22:38.920 --> 22:41.880
Take their weapons,
food, horses.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.160
Take their clothes.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.640
Kill them here.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.520
Oh, thanks a bunch, Sun folk.

22:47.560 --> 22:48.720
We were sent by Veran.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.520
Veran abandoned us.

22:50.560 --> 22:52.320
We'll repay him with blood.

22:52.360 --> 22:53.920
Yours.
Let me speak.

22:57.160 --> 22:58.600
Kill him first.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.200
Come here.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.160
Halt!

23:08.920 --> 23:10.400
Antedia of the Regni.

23:19.680 --> 23:21.800
Behold the queen!

23:21.840 --> 23:23.000
The queen!

23:37.840 --> 23:40.280
That's what I'm talking about.

23:53.080 --> 23:54.800
Okay, what have you
got for me?

23:54.840 --> 23:56.960
That depends.
What have you got for me?

23:57.000 --> 23:58.760
Now that depends
on what you've got for...

24:00.240 --> 24:02.160
Everything all right?

24:02.200 --> 24:04.040
Yes, fine.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.640
You don't look so good.
Met your wife.

24:07.920 --> 24:09.920
Sorry, how do you
know my wife?

24:09.960 --> 24:11.640
When did you meet my wife?

24:11.680 --> 24:12.920
Touchy subject?

24:12.960 --> 24:15.160
When did you meet my wife?
Are you shouting at me?

24:16.760 --> 24:18.160
No.
Well, that's lucky.

24:18.200 --> 24:19.560
Last person that shouted at me

24:19.600 --> 24:21.760
didn't make it to
the end of the sentence.

24:22.560 --> 24:23.760
I didn't meet her, I saw her.

24:23.800 --> 24:25.400
Her and her mates
are heading this way.

24:25.440 --> 24:27.640
She looks like quite the package.

24:27.680 --> 24:29.760
Okay, look,
we both know how this works.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.520
So, please, you just
tell me what small,

24:32.560 --> 24:34.560
possibly useful,
possibly baffling,

24:34.600 --> 24:36.840
possibly completely useless,

24:36.880 --> 24:39.080
nugget of information
you have for me,

24:39.120 --> 24:42.000
in exchange for
unthinkable riches.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.640
Speaking of which...

24:43.680 --> 24:44.800
Well, I'll get them to you.

24:44.840 --> 24:46.520
They're up in the villa.
When?

24:46.560 --> 24:48.560
When my fucking wife
isn't looking.

24:52.840 --> 24:54.400
Veran's searching for someone.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.440
Your friend Lucius, the deserter.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.640
You know where he is.

24:59.680 --> 25:01.360
Also know who
Veran sent after him.

25:03.760 --> 25:07.440
Two nuggets. That's twice
the unthinkable riches.

25:07.480 --> 25:08.760
Who was it?

25:08.800 --> 25:11.120
Sure you want
the other fellow to know?

25:11.160 --> 25:12.880
What other fellow?
Your man over there.

25:27.400 --> 25:31.000
All hail Antedia of the Regni!

25:32.080 --> 25:34.280
Whatever she's lost,

25:34.320 --> 25:36.560
she will always be
a queen at our table.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.840
We're fighting
the Brigantes.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.520
Bastard scum.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.440
Taken out majority of them.

25:50.480 --> 25:54.760
Finally, our two tribes
have them pinned down.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.520
But the Brigantes
aren't budging.

25:56.560 --> 25:58.440
They're all set
to winter us out

25:58.480 --> 25:59.720
and this one...

26:01.760 --> 26:04.160
This one leads down
a fire storm

26:04.200 --> 26:05.440
and drives her chariot

26:05.480 --> 26:07.120
clean through the flaming fort,

26:07.160 --> 26:08.400
out the other side

26:08.440 --> 26:11.480
with old King Arthur's head
on a spike!

26:11.520 --> 26:14.520
His face like...

26:14.560 --> 26:18.760
To the hairiest, drunkenest,
most faithful allies

26:18.800 --> 26:20.520
a queen could ever wish for.

26:23.760 --> 26:26.400
What brings you
to these lands, cousin?

26:26.440 --> 26:28.080
Chasing a wife again?

26:32.160 --> 26:33.560
Uh, the Romans came.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.000
Father refused terms...

26:41.760 --> 26:44.120
...and they hounded and...

26:45.880 --> 26:49.360
...slaughtered us
through the dark moons...

26:51.160 --> 26:52.440
...before you...

26:54.040 --> 26:55.960
...the last of the Bogie.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.400
You are the last
of the Regni.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.440
But there is hope.

27:07.440 --> 27:08.880
One sent by the gods.

27:08.920 --> 27:10.840
So goes the prophecy,
the prophecy of Veran.

27:10.880 --> 27:15.000
Ah, yes, the Druids.
They can sure trot it out.

27:15.040 --> 27:16.920
The Druids hear
the word of the gods.

27:16.960 --> 27:18.640
And you know
she walks the land.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.120
The daughter of the gods.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.800
The Chosen One.

27:21.840 --> 27:24.280
They say she commands
an army of thousands,

27:24.320 --> 27:26.760
that she can turn them
invisible at will.

27:26.800 --> 27:28.600
She rides the winged horse
of Epona.

27:29.720 --> 27:31.040
These things have been seen.

27:31.080 --> 27:33.240
Soon she will
appear to us carrying

27:33.280 --> 27:37.440
the spear of the ancestors
to smite the Roman devils.

27:38.880 --> 27:41.200
Invisible armies, flying horses.

27:41.240 --> 27:43.720
The wine's addled
your brain, cousin.

27:43.760 --> 27:44.760
No.

27:46.560 --> 27:48.440
No.

27:48.480 --> 27:49.840
I know it.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.800
The gods must see what has become
of their children.

27:58.640 --> 28:00.560
The gods

28:00.600 --> 28:02.720
will not abide our suffering.

28:02.760 --> 28:05.040
The gods

28:05.080 --> 28:06.440
will not abandon us!

28:07.720 --> 28:09.360
Your people will
rise again, brother.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.080
Believe it.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.080
You all right?
I'm fine.

28:35.120 --> 28:37.680
It's just in the morning I have to

28:37.720 --> 28:40.280
ride the winged horse of Epona
and smite the Roman devils.

28:40.320 --> 28:42.600
Yeah.

28:51.960 --> 28:53.520
You're right.
We should go to bed.

28:53.560 --> 28:55.440
I think that's
a great idea.

28:55.480 --> 28:58.200
Better than great.
It's immaculate.

29:01.760 --> 29:03.200
Good night.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.240
Get rid of him.

29:12.320 --> 29:14.160
What?
All of them.

29:14.200 --> 29:16.240
You and I can do this.
Like before.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.720
You're not much of
a team player, are you?

29:18.760 --> 29:19.800
I'm telling you,

29:19.840 --> 29:22.800
something is wrong.
I don't know what it is,

29:22.840 --> 29:25.480
but whatever Veran planned,
it wasn't this.

29:26.280 --> 29:28.520
You can change it.
You're in charge.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.920
Make a choice.

29:30.960 --> 29:32.800
Listen to me now.

29:32.840 --> 29:34.400
Either you accept
how things are,

29:34.440 --> 29:35.640
or I will make a choice.

29:37.280 --> 29:40.080
You're not serious.
Try me.

29:58.600 --> 30:01.040
I should be toasting you
with the finest mead.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.360
At least you're not stuck.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.880
A vermin groped
from this forsaken hole.

30:09.160 --> 30:11.800
Remember the Demetae.

30:11.840 --> 30:14.400
Bastards. Fuck 'em!

30:15.720 --> 30:16.800
And the Atrebates.

30:16.840 --> 30:17.880
Whoa!

30:17.920 --> 30:19.320
Wankers.
Yeah.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.680
Fight like mice.
Yeah.

30:21.720 --> 30:25.160
Oh. Oh, and let's not forget

30:26.040 --> 30:28.120
the cunty Cantii.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.320
Worse of the fucking lot.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.720
King Pellenor,

30:31.760 --> 30:36.240
what a grim, foul, four-faced
slippery twat he was.

30:36.280 --> 30:38.720
And that bitch daughter
of his, Cara.

30:38.760 --> 30:40.480
Oh, cuppen up.

30:40.520 --> 30:43.680
Don't get me started
on that boss-eyed twonk.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.440
Pretty?
I'd rather fuck an elk.

30:50.720 --> 30:53.240
Oh, thank the Gods,
they're both dead.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.440
And I hear, I hear that,

30:55.480 --> 30:58.880
that half-wit prince Phelan
is still knocking about.

30:58.920 --> 31:00.680
What would we do

31:00.720 --> 31:02.960
if he walked in right now?

31:04.240 --> 31:05.520
What would we do?

31:05.560 --> 31:07.880
Go.
Roast him!

31:07.920 --> 31:08.960
Yeah!

31:09.000 --> 31:10.280
Alive and kicking!

31:12.720 --> 31:15.320
Tell me, what would
you do, Quant.

31:19.720 --> 31:22.000
In your own time, Quant.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.920
Come on, Quant!

31:23.960 --> 31:26.000
I'm a Cantii.

31:28.600 --> 31:29.680
What did you say?

31:30.880 --> 31:33.320
I'm Canti...

31:36.360 --> 31:40.000
I can't end this evening
