ANNOUNCER: <i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> East Los High...

00:02.280 --> 00:04.849
You ready for tomorrow?
I’m super nervous.

00:04.849 --> 00:06.685
Listen, don’t let Adrian
get to you.

00:06.685 --> 00:08.253
Ceci had
my loser brother’s baby

00:08.253 --> 00:09.487
and dropped out.

00:09.487 --> 00:10.689
He’s a great coach.

00:10.689 --> 00:13.158
Yeah, well, you’re better.

00:13.158 --> 00:14.526
Think I’m falling
in love with you.

00:14.526 --> 00:16.228
So, what’s wrong with that?

00:16.228 --> 00:17.729
If you keeping messing
with Jesus,

00:17.729 --> 00:20.599
you’re still in the game,
and you’re in danger.

00:20.599 --> 00:22.667
So, what, you don’t want
to be with me no more?

00:22.667 --> 00:25.270
I do wanna be with you,
but not like this.

00:25.270 --> 00:26.571
JESUS: I’ll do anything.

00:26.571 --> 00:28.206
I’ll even get out of the game.

00:28.206 --> 00:29.808
What d--

00:29.808 --> 00:31.476
NICOLAS: Surprised?

00:33.745 --> 00:36.615
When did you get
outta jail?

00:36.615 --> 00:39.517
Aren't you happy
to see me?

00:39.517 --> 00:41.553
I’m-I’m just surprised.

00:41.553 --> 00:43.555
How'd you get out so quick?

00:43.555 --> 00:45.824
Doesn't matter
how I got out.

00:45.824 --> 00:49.828
What matters is I'm here
with the girl I love.

00:53.632 --> 00:56.167
Nic, things are different.

00:56.167 --> 00:57.769
I-I know.

00:57.769 --> 00:59.537
( sighs )

00:59.537 --> 01:02.440
What the hell
was Jesus doing here?

01:02.440 --> 01:03.608
I told you
to stay away from him.

01:03.608 --> 01:05.644
Well, you can’t tell me
what to do.

01:05.644 --> 01:07.646
Look, I’m sorry, Camila.

01:07.646 --> 01:10.248
I’m the one that got you
into this, and now
I’m gonna get you out.

01:10.248 --> 01:11.716
It’s okay. I’m already out.

01:11.716 --> 01:14.686
No, you’re not out until you
come to New York with me.

01:14.686 --> 01:17.756
Jesus is dangerous.

01:17.756 --> 01:20.625
He's killed people.

She keeps throwing her clothes

02:08.396 --> 02:10.599
She's like a mini Miley Cyrus.

02:10.599 --> 02:12.470
Aw, that just means

02:18.281 --> 02:19.750
Mwah.

02:19.750 --> 02:22.590
Is that bracelet silver
or gold?

02:22.590 --> 02:25.295
Silver, skonka. You think you’d
get gold for an overnighter?

This is bullshit!

02:29.536 --> 02:30.706
( knock on door )

02:30.706 --> 02:32.342
Hey, that’s Jacob.
I gotta go.

02:32.342 --> 02:34.346
You're gonna let Jacob
in your room?

02:34.346 --> 02:35.849
Where else
you gonna let him in?

02:35.849 --> 02:37.585
Stop.

02:37.585 --> 02:39.923
Good morning, Coach Camayo.
Good morning.

02:39.923 --> 02:41.660
Ready to win?

02:41.660 --> 02:43.764
I'm gonna need
something more than coffee.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.570
What did you have in mind?

02:46.570 --> 02:49.275
How about some sugar?

02:49.275 --> 02:51.479
How about some brown sugar?

02:51.479 --> 02:54.351
Get outta here.
Go check on the boys.

02:54.351 --> 02:55.487
All right.

02:59.662 --> 03:02.834
Ooh, Abuela,
I missed you.

03:02.834 --> 03:04.438
Oh, don't lie.

03:04.438 --> 03:06.475
What you missed
was my chicken.

03:06.475 --> 03:07.743
Yeah, right.

03:07.743 --> 03:10.349
Ugh, I hate jail.

03:10.349 --> 03:11.986
So how does it feel, bro?

03:11.986 --> 03:13.755
Yeah, you're free.

03:13.755 --> 03:15.292
Thanks to you all,
I got--

03:15.292 --> 03:17.396
I got a good lawyer.
I got lucky.

03:17.396 --> 03:18.765
Yeah, lucky.

03:18.765 --> 03:20.904
DAYSI:
You got the best.

03:20.904 --> 03:22.440
My uncle is bad ass.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.742
Andres Cantu.

03:23.742 --> 03:25.946
There is nothing
he can't do.

03:25.946 --> 03:28.552
Yeah, you didn't even
have to plea.

03:28.552 --> 03:30.288
It's like
it never even happened.

03:30.288 --> 03:32.025
But it did.

03:32.025 --> 03:34.029
Don't start, Jose.

He got caught
transporting <i>drogas.</i>

03:42.345 --> 03:44.616
In my 40 years
in this country,

03:44.616 --> 03:46.787
I have never broken a law

03:46.787 --> 03:49.525
or been to jail.
<i>
Dejalo.</i>

03:49.525 --> 03:52.498
Nicolas learned his lesson.
<i>Verdad, mijito?</i>

03:52.498 --> 03:54.502
No, no, no,
Abuelo is right.

03:54.502 --> 03:57.474
Okay? I messed up--

03:57.474 --> 03:59.780
big time, real big--

03:59.780 --> 04:02.084
and I hurt the people I love.

04:02.084 --> 04:05.057
( speaking Spanish )

04:06.759 --> 04:08.462
You better not.

04:08.462 --> 04:11.468
I’m starting over, okay?

04:11.468 --> 04:14.441
And I'm getting out of L.A.
and I’m going back to New York.

04:14.441 --> 04:16.379
You are?

04:16.379 --> 04:18.515
Yeah, and Camila's coming
with me.

04:18.515 --> 04:20.486
She is?
Yeah.

04:20.486 --> 04:22.557
She is?

04:40.525 --> 04:41.694
Shh--

04:41.694 --> 04:43.698
You scared me.

04:45.134 --> 04:47.038
Did anybody follow you here?

04:47.038 --> 04:48.708
No.

04:48.708 --> 04:51.413
Did your mom and Mateo
make it to Fresno okay?

04:51.413 --> 04:53.483
Yeah.

04:53.483 --> 04:55.888
Yeah, they’ll be safe there
till this all cools down,
you know?

05:03.805 --> 05:06.743
Wait. Hold on.

05:06.743 --> 05:10.383
I got something to tell you.

05:10.383 --> 05:11.786
Nic came to see me.

05:11.786 --> 05:14.090
Nic?

05:15.626 --> 05:17.063
Yeah.

05:19.434 --> 05:21.705
How did he get out
so quick?

05:25.012 --> 05:30.121
He, um, he wants me
to go to New York with him.

Excuse you.

05:47.022 --> 05:48.892
That’s
the Las Vegas Jackpots.

05:48.892 --> 05:50.595
Yeah, well,
that’s a royal flush.

05:50.595 --> 05:53.201
Perfect hair,

What about you, Ceci?

06:06.493 --> 06:08.497
I've seen
all their videos.

06:08.497 --> 06:10.167
We're screwed.
Shut up.

06:10.167 --> 06:12.138
Eddie! Where’s Eddie?

06:12.138 --> 06:13.674
What’s up, man?

06:13.674 --> 06:15.811
Hey, there’s a problem
with your application.

06:15.811 --> 06:16.947
Very big problem.

06:16.947 --> 06:18.883
Uh, what is it?

06:18.883 --> 06:22.657
Something about missing proof
of citizenship.

06:22.657 --> 06:24.761
No, remember I gave you
my student ID?

06:24.761 --> 06:27.166
The form clearly states
that you’re to include

06:27.166 --> 06:30.640
a birth certificate
or a green card.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.111
Are you illegal?

06:33.111 --> 06:36.552
Wait. No, no, just because
he’s from East Los and Mexican
doesn’t mean he’s undocumented.

06:36.552 --> 06:38.222
Wait, can't he just use
his student ID?

06:38.222 --> 06:39.758
Yeah, Eddie's one
of our leads.

06:39.758 --> 06:41.661
No exceptions.

06:41.661 --> 06:43.164
Why can't you people play
by the rules?

06:43.164 --> 06:46.170
You people? No, lady,
it was an honest mistake.

06:46.170 --> 06:48.541
I just don't have those papers
with me. I’m so sorry.

06:48.541 --> 06:50.545
You should be sorry.

06:50.545 --> 06:53.183
You shouldn't even be
in this competition,
let alone this country.

06:53.183 --> 06:55.187
Oh, no, you can’t talk
to my dancers like that.

06:55.187 --> 06:57.226
Like, he has a right
to be here.

06:57.226 --> 06:58.661
Oh, really?

06:58.661 --> 07:00.731
Well, you are taking away
the opportunity

07:00.731 --> 07:03.037
from a legitimate team
to win prize money,

07:03.037 --> 07:05.675
and we have sponsors
to look after.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.045
Man, I've lived in this country
my whole life.

07:07.045 --> 07:09.616
I'm just as American
as you are.

07:09.616 --> 07:11.186
This is Arizona.

07:11.186 --> 07:13.657
Not Mexi-fornia.

07:13.657 --> 07:16.530
We have rules here
and we enforce them.

07:16.530 --> 07:18.500
You have a choice to make.

07:18.500 --> 07:22.841
You either compete without him
or not at all.

07:30.925 --> 07:33.262
Okay, there we go.

07:33.262 --> 07:34.565
Hi.

07:34.565 --> 07:35.733
Hi.

07:35.733 --> 07:37.904
You are gorgeous.

07:37.904 --> 07:39.875
Mm.
Oh.

07:39.875 --> 07:41.812
I think
we have another fan.

07:41.812 --> 07:43.616
No.
Mm-hm.

07:43.616 --> 07:45.119
Half for you

07:45.119 --> 07:47.557
and half for me.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.531
Um, hm.

07:51.531 --> 07:55.539
Let me call Mommy first to see
if you can eat this, okay?

07:55.539 --> 07:59.146
( dance music playing )

08:01.117 --> 08:03.989
Hey, what’s up?
Is Isela okay?

08:03.989 --> 08:05.692
<i>Chill out.</i>

08:05.692 --> 08:07.695
I’m just checking to see
if she's allergic to nuts.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.667
I know you're not.

08:09.667 --> 08:11.670
No, she's not,
but thanks for checking.

08:11.670 --> 08:13.307
Listen, I'm in the middle
of something. I gotta go.

08:13.307 --> 08:15.311
By the way, OMG,

08:15.311 --> 08:18.316
you never told me
Isela was such a guy magnet.

08:18.316 --> 08:19.953
Aye, tell me later.
I gotta go.

08:19.953 --> 08:22.324
( sighs )

08:22.324 --> 08:25.130
I like you.
You’re not rude like Mommy.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.136
Ha.
Yeah.

08:28.136 --> 08:29.338
( laughs )

08:29.338 --> 08:33.279
( hip-hop playing )

08:59.230 --> 09:01.100
OMAR: Hey, man.

09:01.100 --> 09:03.170
I didn't know
you were undocumented.

09:03.170 --> 09:05.075
I was born in Mexico.

09:05.075 --> 09:07.279
My ma is Mexican
and my dad’s Cuban,

09:07.279 --> 09:09.349
but I never really
knew him.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.955
It's not something
I like to talk about, man.

09:11.955 --> 09:14.058
Aren't you afraid
you're gonna get deported?

09:14.058 --> 09:16.864
Hell, yeah, especially
after talking to that lady.

09:16.864 --> 09:18.267
Right?

09:18.267 --> 09:20.938
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Please exit the stage.</i>

09:20.938 --> 09:23.944
<i>Westside Hornets,</i>
<i>please take the stage.</i>

09:23.944 --> 09:26.350
So, what's it going to be?

09:26.350 --> 09:28.353
They're gonna compete.

09:28.353 --> 09:29.956
Just not with me.

09:29.956 --> 09:31.292
You’re doing the right thing.

09:31.292 --> 09:34.632
They don't have a chance.

09:34.632 --> 09:38.740
( hip-hop playing )

09:55.306 --> 09:57.043
Hey, don't worry
about me.

09:57.043 --> 10:00.049
You guys win this.
I’m just gonna drop out.

10:02.085 --> 10:05.091
Hey, hey, Ceci.
Don’t look so sad.

10:05.091 --> 10:07.329
We’re gonna give you
something to cry about
when we kick your asses.

10:07.329 --> 10:10.970
Man, get out of here,
Adrian.

10:41.296 --> 10:43.132
What are we gonna do
about the dance?

10:43.132 --> 10:45.236
Keep running the combination
until we get it right.

10:45.236 --> 10:48.042
We’re just going
from eight dancers to seven,
and it’s mostly freestyle.

10:48.042 --> 10:51.248
There’s no way we can learn
a new dance in five minutes.

10:51.248 --> 10:54.321
Relax. I’m just changing
Gina’s spacing formations,
entrances and exits.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.825
Look, it’s no big deal.
You can do it.

10:56.825 --> 10:57.928
Let’s go ahead
and take it from here.

10:57.928 --> 10:59.163
Santi, I want you

10:59.163 --> 11:01.168
to fill those spaces
where Eddie was.

11:01.168 --> 11:02.269
Okay, so from here, everybody.

11:20.505 --> 11:23.511
( cheers and applause )

11:25.882 --> 11:28.254
ANNOUNCER: <i>East Los Bomb Squad,</i>
<i>please take the stage.</i>

11:28.254 --> 11:29.423
We got this, bro.

11:29.423 --> 11:32.329
CECI:
Let’s go, Bomb Squad!

11:35.068 --> 11:38.473
( Chonique Sneed’s "Let It Go"
playing )

13:34.566 --> 13:35.969
( cheering )

13:35.969 --> 13:39.277
Yeah!

13:39.277 --> 13:41.446
( cheering )

13:41.446 --> 13:42.882
You guys did it!

13:45.121 --> 13:47.192
What’s wrong?

13:47.192 --> 13:50.231
I been hearing
a lot of stuff...

13:54.071 --> 13:56.977
And I need you
to be straight up with me.

14:00.952 --> 14:02.989
About what?

14:06.964 --> 14:09.936
They're saying
that you killed people and--

14:09.936 --> 14:11.071
Who?

14:11.071 --> 14:13.943
Who’s they?

14:13.943 --> 14:17.584
What, Nic?

14:17.584 --> 14:22.059
I got you out of the game
and he can’t handle that.

14:22.059 --> 14:25.532
You still haven’t answered
my question.

14:30.976 --> 14:33.281
Are you a killer?

14:39.226 --> 14:42.365
I ain’t no angel,

14:42.365 --> 14:45.371
but I never killed nobody.

14:48.277 --> 14:50.682
ANNOUNCER: <i>Western Division,</i>
<i>third places goes to</i>

14:50.682 --> 14:53.287
<i>Las Vegas Jackpots.</i>

14:55.257 --> 14:56.560
Congratulations.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.698
Thank you.

14:58.698 --> 15:02.305
<i>Second place goes to</i>
<i>Westside Hornets.</i>

15:02.305 --> 15:03.373
What?

15:06.312 --> 15:07.314
Good job.

15:10.187 --> 15:12.291
( muttering )

15:12.291 --> 15:14.128
MAN: So ridiculous!

15:14.128 --> 15:18.636
<i>Western Division champions,</i>
<i>first place goes to</i>

15:18.636 --> 15:21.676
<i>East Los High Bomb Squad.</i>

15:21.676 --> 15:23.747
Yeah!

15:26.284 --> 15:29.024
WOMAN: Seriously,
is this a joke?

15:33.465 --> 15:35.536
Thank you.

15:35.536 --> 15:38.041
Winning first place
means so much to us,

15:38.041 --> 15:39.644
because it took a lot
to get here.

15:39.644 --> 15:41.314
But we can't accept this.

15:41.314 --> 15:44.154
What?

15:44.154 --> 15:46.157
The politics
of this competition suck.

15:46.157 --> 15:47.593
You can keep
your <i>pinche</i> award.

15:47.593 --> 15:50.532
This has nothing
to do with politics.

15:50.532 --> 15:54.039
Rules are rules.

15:54.039 --> 15:56.010
I mean, I couldn't
let you dance,

15:56.010 --> 15:57.579
because you’re illegal.

15:57.579 --> 16:00.552
Correction.
I’m undocumented.

16:00.552 --> 16:03.257
And I want to dedicate this win
to all the people like me

16:03.257 --> 16:06.330
who only know this country
and have nothing but love for it

16:06.330 --> 16:08.333
but just don’t get
the same opportunities

16:08.333 --> 16:11.372
and who are living
in constant fear because of it.

16:11.372 --> 16:13.343
This is for us.

16:13.343 --> 16:17.051
East Los all the way, baby!
Whoo!

16:17.051 --> 16:19.755
East Los! East Los!
East Los! East Los!

16:19.755 --> 16:22.628
East Los! East Los!
East Los! East Los!

16:22.628 --> 16:24.197
( booing )

16:24.197 --> 16:26.102
Go home, Ceci!

16:26.102 --> 16:28.038
East Los! East Los! East Los!

16:29.741 --> 16:33.149
Aw, shit.
Jesus has risen.

16:33.149 --> 16:36.155
It's a miracle.

16:36.155 --> 16:39.161
So, you ready
to get back to work?

16:39.161 --> 16:41.598
Can’t.
Too hot right now.

16:41.598 --> 16:44.671
You talkin' about the guy
from Pomona who shot you.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.808
We'll take care of him
for you.

16:46.808 --> 16:50.115
<i>Pero...</i> you gonna
have to do something for us.

16:53.822 --> 16:55.492
Like what?

16:55.492 --> 16:57.062
Did you know Nic was out?

17:06.346 --> 17:08.350
Man, that’s so messed up.

17:08.350 --> 17:10.755
I’m glad you were there
with us.

17:10.755 --> 17:12.593
Yeah.

17:12.593 --> 17:15.130
I liked the way
you stood up for your team.

17:15.130 --> 17:18.470
That’s right. Nobody messes
with my Bomb Squad.

17:18.470 --> 17:21.176
TIFFANY:
Aw, thanks, Coach!

17:21.176 --> 17:24.115
Hey, beautiful.

17:24.115 --> 17:26.553
You were great out there.

17:26.553 --> 17:30.127
The team won
because of you.

17:30.127 --> 17:31.863
What?

17:31.863 --> 17:34.568
How come you didn't tell me
you were undocumented?

17:34.568 --> 17:36.805
Didn't you see
what just happened?

17:36.805 --> 17:39.478
It's against the law and a lot
of people think it's wrong.

17:39.478 --> 17:42.584
I don't care about them.
I’m talking about you and me.

17:42.584 --> 17:45.757
You lied to me.
No, I didn’t.

17:45.757 --> 17:47.761
I’m done talking
to you.

17:47.761 --> 17:52.237
Gina, I was scared
you wouldn't wanna be with me.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.745
See, it changes stuff,
doesn't it?

17:56.745 --> 17:58.815
Yeah, it does.

18:00.887 --> 18:03.158
So, what are you trying
to say?

18:03.158 --> 18:05.162
What other secrets
are you hiding from me?

18:05.162 --> 18:06.631
Nothing.

18:06.631 --> 18:10.338
I can't be with somebody
that I don't trust.

18:10.338 --> 18:13.243
So we're done?

18:13.243 --> 18:15.448
Yeah.

18:15.448 --> 18:17.453
I am.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.799
( ringtone playing )

18:28.273 --> 18:30.578
Hi. Alejandro.

18:30.578 --> 18:33.450
It’s so good
to hear from you so soon.

18:33.450 --> 18:36.423
Oh, no,
it’s not desperate at all.

18:36.423 --> 18:40.764
I love it.
A man who knows what he wants.

18:40.764 --> 18:43.603
Tonight?

18:43.603 --> 18:46.609
I can move things around.

18:46.609 --> 18:49.648
Okay.

18:49.648 --> 18:52.186
I’ll see you there.

18:53.755 --> 18:55.627
( squeals )

18:55.627 --> 18:59.902
Auntie Vanessa
has a date.

18:59.902 --> 19:02.172
Ha! Yes.

19:02.172 --> 19:04.343
( whispers )
Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes.

19:15.766 --> 19:17.570
DAYSI: Yo, Eddie,
we gotta talk to you.

19:17.570 --> 19:19.339
What?

19:19.339 --> 19:21.344
What’s going on?
JOCELYN:
Well, didn’t you hear?

19:21.344 --> 19:23.347
The Yuma local news
picked up the story

19:23.347 --> 19:25.351
about you guys turning down
the dance trophy.

19:25.351 --> 19:26.855
Am I in any of the pictures?

19:26.855 --> 19:29.326
Are you afraid
your life’s gonna change

19:29.326 --> 19:32.432
now that everybody knows
about your undocumented status?

19:33.734 --> 19:35.637
It already has.

19:42.217 --> 19:44.788
Damn. Bomb Squad’s
all over the Internet.

19:46.959 --> 19:49.465
Your boyfriend's famous!

19:49.465 --> 19:51.536
He’s not my boyfriend.

19:51.536 --> 19:53.940
You’re starting
to sound just like me.

19:53.940 --> 19:56.579
Dude, but for real,
it’s kind of messed up

19:56.579 --> 19:59.785
that you broke up with him
just ’cause he's undocumented.

19:59.785 --> 20:03.659
Coming from my <i>loca</i> sister
who has two <i>narco novios?</i>

20:03.659 --> 20:05.664
Hey, this isn't about me, okay?

20:05.664 --> 20:08.936
For once.

20:08.936 --> 20:12.610
God, I'm just so sick and tired
of being lied to by men.

20:12.610 --> 20:14.847
First Diego, then Dad.

20:14.847 --> 20:17.485
And now Eddie.

20:17.485 --> 20:19.490
You’re probably
taking it out on Eddie

20:19.490 --> 20:22.495
’cause you never dealt
with Diego cheating on you

20:22.495 --> 20:25.268
and then what Dad did
to us.
Shut up.

20:26.604 --> 20:28.674
I think you got trust issues.

20:30.378 --> 20:32.850
Listen to you, Doctora Phil.

20:32.850 --> 20:36.924
One month of therapy and you
just got all the answers.

20:36.924 --> 20:40.698
I’m just saying,
therapy does help.

20:40.698 --> 20:45.307
Look, I know Eddie
is a good guy.

20:45.307 --> 20:48.346
But that doesn’t change the fact
that he still lied to me.

20:48.346 --> 20:51.386
Gina, he’s undocumented.

20:51.386 --> 20:53.590
You know what that means?

20:53.590 --> 20:55.594
If he tells the wrong person,

20:55.594 --> 20:58.299
he'll be riding a one-way donkey
back to Tijuana.

20:58.299 --> 21:00.303
Yeah, but I'm not
the wrong person.

21:00.303 --> 21:02.306
I was his girlfriend.

21:02.306 --> 21:04.845
I would never do anything
like that to hurt him.

21:04.845 --> 21:07.082
You're hurting him right now.

21:16.868 --> 21:18.572
Hello!

21:18.572 --> 21:19.708
Hello.

21:19.708 --> 21:20.943
Hey!

21:20.943 --> 21:22.480
( high voice )
Who is this?

21:22.480 --> 21:24.784
Oh. Uhh!

21:24.784 --> 21:26.554
Hey, I missed you.

21:26.554 --> 21:28.559
I missed you too.

21:28.559 --> 21:30.595
You want to play
with your blocks?

21:30.595 --> 21:32.432
Thank you so much
for helping out.

21:32.432 --> 21:34.537
My pleasure.

21:34.537 --> 21:36.440
It was good karma too,

21:36.440 --> 21:38.043
’cause I met a guy
who asked me out to dinner.

21:38.043 --> 21:41.383
What?
What’s his name?

21:41.383 --> 21:45.658
Alejandro.
Oh, he is perfect.

21:45.658 --> 21:47.829
I have a good feeling
about him.

21:47.829 --> 21:50.033
Good.

21:50.033 --> 21:51.336
Okay.

21:51.336 --> 21:54.709
Wish me luck, Iselita.

21:54.709 --> 21:56.412
"Good luck, tia."

21:56.412 --> 21:58.884
Hi, Mommy.
Hi.

21:58.884 --> 22:00.521
Good luck!

22:00.521 --> 22:02.457
You want to go
to the park?

22:08.804 --> 22:11.876
I'm meeting my date here.
His name is Alejandro.

22:11.876 --> 22:13.712
Right this way.

22:19.825 --> 22:20.960
Alejandro.

22:20.960 --> 22:24.467
There she is. Hey.

22:24.467 --> 22:25.937
You look beautiful.

22:25.937 --> 22:29.117
