03:03.183 --> 03:05.784
- You sure this is gonna
be all right, Robert?

03:05.786 --> 03:07.052
- Yeah, your gonna be staying

03:07.054 --> 03:09.588
in the downstairs
guest room anyway.

03:09.590 --> 03:12.257
The guy will never know
it was you and not me.

03:12.259 --> 03:15.127
As long as you
don't burn the place down.

03:15.129 --> 03:17.229
Everything will be fine.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.097
You're really bailing
me out here Andre.

03:19.099 --> 03:21.934
I mean, this thing
got fast tracked,

03:21.936 --> 03:22.935
the only way we
could pull it off

03:22.937 --> 03:25.604
is if we do it this weekend.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.372
- What is it again?

03:27.374 --> 03:29.107
- It's this bullshit
reality show

03:29.109 --> 03:31.310
where we put somebody in a house

03:31.312 --> 03:33.312
and set up a bunch
of security cameras

03:33.314 --> 03:35.814
that follows their every move,

03:35.816 --> 03:37.416
and scare the fuck out of them.

03:44.624 --> 03:45.691
Here we are.

03:58.805 --> 04:00.672
Come on man, I got
to hit the road.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.541
I got to be in sb by seven.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.977
- All right.

04:19.358 --> 04:21.260
- What is it?

04:21.262 --> 04:22.127
- There's something
about this place.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.129
It's really familiar.

04:24.131 --> 04:27.132
- Heh, that's 'cause
you've been here before.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.600
- What?

04:28.602 --> 04:30.669
- Yeah, yeah, we went to that
party a couple years ago.

04:30.671 --> 04:33.505
You met that girl remember?

04:33.507 --> 04:34.406
- Yeah.

04:35.508 --> 04:37.042
What was her name?

04:37.044 --> 04:38.310
- I don't know
what her name was.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.545
You think I remember
all your conquests?

04:40.547 --> 04:41.947
- Really, conquests?

04:44.118 --> 04:46.485
I can't remember
her name, though.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.453
- Well, look that's
why you're here.

04:48.455 --> 04:51.023
Okay, you're gonna
rest for a few days.

04:51.025 --> 04:52.591
You know, the fridge
is fully stocked.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.559
You know, take some you time.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.361
You time, no parties.

04:57.230 --> 04:58.397
- Thanks, man.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.631
- Yeah, no problem.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.066
Look I'll be back to
pick you up on Sunday

05:01.068 --> 05:03.335
and if anything goes
wrong just give me a call.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.169
You got your cell, right?

05:04.171 --> 05:05.404
- Yeah.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.371
- Okay.

05:06.373 --> 05:07.272
Good.

05:08.675 --> 05:09.641
Good luck man.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.542
- Thanks.

05:21.788 --> 05:22.888
- Remember,

05:22.890 --> 05:23.889
no parties.

05:24.757 --> 05:26.224
- What was that?

05:26.226 --> 05:27.459
Throw a party?

05:28.594 --> 05:32.164
If you say so.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.074
Oh, this place is sick.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.506
- So,

07:21.508 --> 07:23.675
I got dropped off at this house,

07:23.677 --> 07:26.711
it's a nice house,
by a buddy Robert.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.246
He was supposed to
house-sit for someone

07:28.248 --> 07:30.549
and he couldn't because
something came up last minute.

07:30.551 --> 07:31.716
To be honest,

07:32.785 --> 07:35.520
it's kinda weird being
in someone's house

07:35.522 --> 07:37.522
when you don't really
know who they are.

07:37.524 --> 07:38.924
I'm sure I'll figure
out more about the guy

07:38.926 --> 07:43.094
as I rummage around through
his shit.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.930
I was just recently
in an accident

07:44.932 --> 07:48.533
and the doctors said
that doing video diaries

07:48.535 --> 07:50.702
of myself would possibly,

07:52.138 --> 07:56.241
not for sure, but possibly
help me remember things.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.643
So, I figured what the heck.

07:59.912 --> 08:00.946
Might as well give it a shot,

08:00.948 --> 08:02.781
and if it works cool if not

08:02.783 --> 08:03.682
it's fine.

08:05.451 --> 08:06.785
I'm gonna go ahead

08:06.787 --> 08:08.453
and make baba a
little birthday video

08:08.455 --> 08:11.022
since I'm missing her
birthday this weekend.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.824
So here goes nothing.

08:16.395 --> 08:17.863
Hey grandma and everyone.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.865
I just wanted to
say I'm so sorry

08:19.867 --> 08:23.235
that I couldn't make it
out to your celebration.

08:23.237 --> 08:25.670
Unfortunately, you know
how accident-prone I am.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.039
I'm okay, don't
worry I'll be fine

08:28.041 --> 08:30.308
but since I couldn't make it
i thought I'd make you a video

08:30.310 --> 08:32.277
for your 80th birthday.

08:33.279 --> 08:34.479
You're a very special woman

08:34.481 --> 08:36.648
and you don't look
a day over 60.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.616
With that being said,

08:38.619 --> 08:40.852
why don't I go ahead
and give you a tour

08:40.854 --> 08:42.254
of my new place.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.926
This over here is
my dining area.

08:47.928 --> 08:50.061
All right, let's go
ahead and take a look

08:50.063 --> 08:51.897
at this kitchen here.

08:54.767 --> 08:57.402
Robert did say that the
fridge was fully stocked,

08:57.404 --> 09:00.572
I want to see if he
was lying or not.

09:01.774 --> 09:02.674
And yeah,

09:04.544 --> 09:07.178
that looks pretty shitty to me.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.015
Naked girls,

09:10.017 --> 09:12.217
that's always a plus too.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.618
I don't mind it.

09:20.426 --> 09:22.327
What the hell is that?

09:27.633 --> 09:28.533
Oh my god,

09:30.369 --> 09:34.439
I know what you are.

09:35.174 --> 09:36.174
Blue dream,

09:37.243 --> 09:38.910
Shiva skunk,

09:38.912 --> 09:40.312
purple og,

09:40.314 --> 09:41.980
twisted sister,

09:41.982 --> 09:43.481
fire og,

09:43.483 --> 09:43.481
happy 420.

09:45.484 --> 09:49.688
I'll have to edit
this out.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.525
Like to make a toast to...

09:56.028 --> 10:00.298
Well, what's gonna be one hell
of an interesting weekend.

10:00.300 --> 10:04.603
I got enough pot here to smoke
myself into fucking oblivion

10:04.605 --> 10:09.507
and there's plenty of booze
to keep myself busy as well.

10:09.509 --> 10:10.642
Cheers to me.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.638
Fucking weird.

10:41.440 --> 10:42.340
Boo!

10:49.482 --> 10:50.682
Over here,

10:50.684 --> 10:53.284
we've got the
entertainment room.

11:03.095 --> 11:05.430
It's like a jungle outside.

11:09.635 --> 11:11.269
All right I got the bud,

11:11.271 --> 11:12.370
I got the booze,

11:12.372 --> 11:15.507
and the only thing I'm missing

11:15.509 --> 11:16.508
is the TV.

11:16.510 --> 11:19.010
- In
so many months--

11:19.012 --> 11:21.946
- it's gonna be a long weekend

11:21.948 --> 11:24.849
and, you know, if
i get a bit lonely

11:24.851 --> 11:26.084
I've got my...

11:27.653 --> 11:29.954
Lovely ladies to keep me busy.

11:29.956 --> 11:33.191
- Last few
miles, will you run.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.927
This fellow is very good, funny.

11:35.929 --> 11:38.997
- Though it gets
eerie down there.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.900
- And
the festivities.

11:43.836 --> 11:45.303
- I am preparing.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.214
- What's behind?

12:01.353 --> 12:02.687
What's in here?

12:06.559 --> 12:07.459
Storage.

12:20.941 --> 12:24.175
Pussy.

12:26.079 --> 12:26.978
Oh shit.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.065
Master bedroom,

12:47.933 --> 12:48.833
nice.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.941
Sorry buddy,

12:56.943 --> 13:00.745
but I am definitely
gonna have to crash here.

13:09.756 --> 13:10.989
How you doing?

13:20.900 --> 13:23.067
He's even got multi-jets.

13:24.336 --> 13:27.305
And what do we got down here?

13:27.307 --> 13:28.206
Nothing.

13:32.011 --> 13:34.345
Go ahead and take this out.

14:22.428 --> 14:25.597
Okay.

14:54.793 --> 14:56.661
Not too shabby.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.496
I can work with this.

15:17.116 --> 15:17.949
Oh,.

15:41.707 --> 15:45.043
That was not intended for
you guys, sorry about that.

16:49.675 --> 16:53.644
God, this place is a lot
bigger than I thought.

17:14.165 --> 17:15.400
So many steps.

18:23.802 --> 18:25.336
It's just the wind folks.

18:25.338 --> 18:29.273
All right, I'm gonna go ahead
and take you guys back inside.

19:00.539 --> 19:02.240
- Now
several days ago the body

19:02.242 --> 19:05.276
of a young missing girl was
found in the trunk of a car

19:05.278 --> 19:09.580
in the canyon; However, there
was no sign of the driver.

19:09.582 --> 19:12.984
Now the coroner's report
indicates that the girl's body

19:12.986 --> 19:17.722
was brutally stabbed and
tortured over several days.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.891
The report also indicates that
- fuck.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.125
- Though
the detectives are

19:21.127 --> 19:22.927
not saying whether
scows disappearance

19:22.929 --> 19:24.428
and the grizzly discovery

19:24.430 --> 19:26.597
of the missing girl
are related but they

19:26.599 --> 19:30.334
are investigating
connections to the two women.

19:30.336 --> 19:34.205
If you have any information
you are urged to call police.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.841
Now in other news,
inmates on death row

19:36.843 --> 19:39.076
are being transported to--

20:22.955 --> 20:24.655
- what the fuck is that?

20:47.747 --> 20:50.381
Crazy.

20:58.390 --> 20:59.290
Rachel.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.494
What's going on babe?

22:36.688 --> 22:38.322
Ah, that felt good.

22:49.268 --> 22:50.101
Rachel,

22:50.103 --> 22:51.535
not Tiffany, not Amber

22:51.537 --> 22:53.237
it's Rachel.

23:02.047 --> 23:04.749
I'm gonna go for a ride,

23:04.751 --> 23:07.218
oh I don't have a car
what am I talking about?

23:07.220 --> 23:10.054
Yep,

23:10.056 --> 23:11.522
kind of pathetic,

23:12.424 --> 23:13.257
oh well, I'll have to get one.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.635
This house has got
some weird noises.

24:19.925 --> 24:21.258
- Are you hungry?

24:21.260 --> 24:23.427
- I'm actually starving.
- - Good.

24:23.429 --> 24:24.829
- You bring me something tasty?

24:24.831 --> 24:26.297
- I got some chicken,

24:26.299 --> 24:28.599
but most importantly i
got some really good wine.

24:28.601 --> 24:31.268
- Ahh, you're so sweet.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.406
- So how you feeling?

24:35.408 --> 24:36.640
- You now,

24:36.642 --> 24:39.009
I'm a little sore, still stiff

24:39.011 --> 24:42.646
but for the most part
I'm starting to heal.

24:51.256 --> 24:53.657
- So what actually happened?

24:55.694 --> 24:57.161
- Well, it was raining

24:57.163 --> 25:00.030
and they said that i
was in a car accident.

25:00.032 --> 25:02.233
I got a concussion,

25:02.235 --> 25:05.469
that's pretty much it, i
can't remember much else.

25:05.471 --> 25:07.872
- Are you ever gonna
be able to remember?

25:07.874 --> 25:09.573
- Yeah, the doctor
said that hopefully

25:09.575 --> 25:11.442
something will jog my memory

25:11.444 --> 25:13.777
and within the next
few days or months

25:13.779 --> 25:16.347
it'll start slowly coming back.

25:16.349 --> 25:19.149
- So,

25:20.452 --> 25:22.953
you don't remember what happened
the last time we hung out?

25:22.955 --> 25:23.854
- No,

25:23.856 --> 25:24.755
should I?

25:26.191 --> 25:27.091
- Maybe.

25:31.029 --> 25:33.097
This place is so creepy.

25:34.866 --> 25:36.867
I don't know how you stay here.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.003
Doesn't it freak you out?

25:40.672 --> 25:42.506
- It is kinda creepy.

25:48.914 --> 25:50.648
- So, what happened?

25:52.083 --> 25:54.818
- Well, I was looking around

25:54.820 --> 25:58.422
and I happen to open
up a cabinet door

25:58.424 --> 26:00.824
and this came crashing
to the ground.

26:00.826 --> 26:04.461
- So you're
still as clumsy as ever.

26:04.463 --> 26:06.463
- I'd like
to make a toast.

26:06.465 --> 26:07.865
- Okay, to what?

26:09.267 --> 26:13.504
- To you and I and remembering
this amazing evening.

26:14.673 --> 26:18.742
- I'll make sure of that.

26:20.645 --> 26:21.612
It is good.

26:22.447 --> 26:23.981
- It's delicious.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.049
I'm stuffed.

26:35.827 --> 26:37.061
- What's this?

26:38.597 --> 26:39.863
- Ah nothing,

26:39.865 --> 26:41.398
I couldn't make it to
my grandma's birthday

26:41.400 --> 26:44.234
so I made her like
a birthday video.

26:44.236 --> 26:45.436
- No you didn't.

26:45.438 --> 26:46.570
- Yeah I didn't.

26:46.572 --> 26:48.072
- Yeah, thank you.

26:48.074 --> 26:49.840
You sure you didn't put
it out for something else?

26:49.842 --> 26:51.075
- No.

26:51.077 --> 26:52.543
- Little a...

26:54.146 --> 26:55.713
Apres dinner.

26:55.715 --> 26:58.048
- No, but I'm not opposed to it.

26:59.986 --> 27:01.118
- Can I watch it?

27:01.120 --> 27:02.519
- It's really, it's just a--

27:02.521 --> 27:03.754
- oh, come on.

27:05.390 --> 27:08.392
- That's just
embarrassing.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.327
- You're so cute.

27:10.329 --> 27:14.198
- I'm so sorry that I couldn't
make it to your celebration.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.534
Unfortunately, you know
how accident-prone I am.

27:17.536 --> 27:19.637
I'm okay, don't
worry I'll be fine.

27:19.639 --> 27:22.072
But since I couldn't make it
i thought I'd make you a video

27:22.074 --> 27:24.742
for your 80th birthday.

27:24.744 --> 27:25.976
You're a very special woman

27:25.978 --> 27:27.611
and you don't look
a day over 60.

27:29.649 --> 27:30.948
- Are we alone?

27:31.950 --> 27:32.850
- Yeah.

27:34.052 --> 27:35.686
- Are you sure?

27:35.688 --> 27:36.587
- Yes.

27:37.722 --> 27:38.622
Look.

27:43.528 --> 27:45.195
- You're a very special
woman and you don't look

27:45.197 --> 27:46.697
a day over 60.

27:55.373 --> 27:57.875
- Okay, this is really weird.

28:01.479 --> 28:03.614
- Let's go check it out.

28:03.616 --> 28:05.082
- Are you sure?

28:05.084 --> 28:07.584
- Yeah, just stay close.

28:07.586 --> 28:08.485
- Okay.

28:42.954 --> 28:45.255
- Don't worry.
- - Ok

29:01.272 --> 29:03.240
you all right?

29:03.242 --> 29:04.141
- Yeah.

29:06.277 --> 29:08.312
No.

29:08.314 --> 29:09.413
- Don't worry about it.

29:09.415 --> 29:10.314
- Okay.

29:25.697 --> 29:28.599
Okay, she's
definitely not moving.

29:28.601 --> 29:30.434
- No, definitely not.

29:31.736 --> 29:33.470
- Something tells me
Robert is messing with me.

29:33.472 --> 29:34.538
- You think.

29:35.640 --> 29:36.974
- I think we had
too much to drink.

29:36.976 --> 29:38.909
- I think we should
have a little more.

29:38.911 --> 29:41.145
- I'm gonna cover this up.

29:56.328 --> 29:57.728
- Are you expecting someone?

29:57.730 --> 29:58.729
- No,

29:58.731 --> 29:59.630
hold this.

30:14.979 --> 30:17.347
- Hi

30:17.349 --> 30:18.916
look, I'm really
sorry to bother you.

30:18.918 --> 30:21.985
My name is guy and I live
four houses up the street,

30:21.987 --> 30:22.886
- yeah?

30:23.988 --> 30:26.290
- You didn't
just get a call

30:26.292 --> 30:28.225
from the police, did you?

30:28.227 --> 30:29.593
- Um, excuse me?

30:29.595 --> 30:32.362
- Look, I know
this sounds strange but

30:32.364 --> 30:34.364
I just got a call
from the police saying

30:34.366 --> 30:36.500
that there was a group
of escaped convicts

30:36.502 --> 30:39.703
loose somewhere
here in the canyon.

30:39.705 --> 30:41.438
I don't know if this
some kind of game,

30:41.440 --> 30:43.507
you haven't heard anything
about this have you?

30:43.509 --> 30:44.842
- No, I didn't.

30:45.944 --> 30:48.212
- Are you sure that
it's not maybe a prank?

30:48.214 --> 30:49.713
- I don't know,

30:49.715 --> 30:51.915
it didn't sound like it.

30:51.917 --> 30:53.317
They asked me to make sure that

30:53.319 --> 30:54.885
all my windows and
doors were locked

30:54.887 --> 30:56.720
and to double check everything.

30:56.722 --> 30:57.621
Are yours?

30:58.523 --> 31:00.424
- Um, I don't know.

31:00.426 --> 31:01.491
I think so.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.327
- You think so. You're not sure?

31:03.329 --> 31:04.828
You need to go right now

31:04.830 --> 31:06.597
- are you okay?
- - And check,

31:06.599 --> 31:07.764
hi I'm guy, I'm the neighbor

31:07.766 --> 31:09.199
and I just got a
police bulletin saying

31:09.201 --> 31:10.801
that there's a group
of escaped convicts

31:10.803 --> 31:13.036
loose in the neighborhood.

31:13.038 --> 31:15.205
Now, there's no guarantee
that they make it up here

31:15.207 --> 31:16.573
but just in case.

31:16.575 --> 31:17.774
- So, when did this all happen?

31:17.776 --> 31:20.177
- I just got the phone call.

31:21.579 --> 31:24.982
Well, your windows up
here seem to be secure.

31:24.984 --> 31:26.316
Door is locked.

31:28.419 --> 31:30.120
- I mean, I don't
know what to say.

31:30.122 --> 31:31.355
- I know.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.257
It's a really nice
place you got here.

31:33.259 --> 31:34.791
- Um--

31:34.793 --> 31:36.493
- if you want to keep it this
way I suggest you make sure

31:36.495 --> 31:39.897
all your doors and
windows are locked.

31:39.899 --> 31:41.732
- And you said you lived
just a couple houses--

31:41.734 --> 31:43.667
- I just moved into the
Spanish villa four doors up.

31:43.669 --> 31:44.868
Is this the downstairs?

31:44.870 --> 31:47.070
- Yeah, I don't mean to be rude.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.438
I appreciate you coming here.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.574
Would you mind
staying here with her?

31:50.576 --> 31:52.175
- No not at all.

31:52.177 --> 31:53.176
- You okay with that?

31:53.178 --> 31:54.611
- Yeah.

31:54.613 --> 31:56.546
- I'll go check out
everything else.

31:56.548 --> 31:57.581
- Of course.

31:57.583 --> 31:58.749
- Thank you.

31:58.751 --> 31:59.983
- My pleasure.

31:59.985 --> 32:00.784
- Have you
called the police?

32:00.786 --> 32:02.252
- Oh, they called me.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.086
Oh and make sure you check
every door and window.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.054
- Sure thing.

32:04.056 --> 32:04.988
- Don't miss one.

32:04.990 --> 32:06.189
- Be right back, rach.

32:06.191 --> 32:07.090
- Yeah,

32:08.259 --> 32:09.660
crazy night right?

32:09.662 --> 32:12.930
- Yeah.

32:12.932 --> 32:14.765
- This really is a nice place.

32:14.767 --> 32:16.166
- Yeah.

32:17.535 --> 32:19.369
This is insane.

32:19.371 --> 32:20.804
- Yeah,

32:20.806 --> 32:23.240
nothing like a police emergency
to ruin somebody's night.

32:23.242 --> 32:25.042
You know what I mean?

32:27.680 --> 32:29.680
So how long have you two
been seeing each other?

32:29.682 --> 32:32.115
- Oh, just a little while.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.917
- Make a cute couple.

32:36.888 --> 32:40.057
You don't find these
a little creepy?

32:42.894 --> 32:44.461
- Can I get you anything?

32:44.463 --> 32:46.296
- Oh, no-no-no, I'm
okay, thank you.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.932
I'll be going in just a minute.

32:48.934 --> 32:49.833
So,

32:51.002 --> 32:52.836
how long have you
two been fucking?

32:52.838 --> 32:54.404
- Excuse me?

32:54.406 --> 32:56.373
That's none of your business.

32:56.375 --> 32:57.407
- Fine,

32:57.409 --> 32:58.475
just asking.

33:01.045 --> 33:05.615
So when you guys fuck does he
cum on your face, or your ass

33:05.617 --> 33:07.784
or tits?

33:07.786 --> 33:09.486
Wow.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.122
- I-i, it's time for you to go.

33:13.825 --> 33:14.725
I'm fine.

33:17.261 --> 33:18.328
- Wow, okay.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.298
I put my gloves on.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.532
- A-Andre.

33:22.534 --> 33:23.767
- Oh, I wouldn't
worry about that.

33:23.769 --> 33:25.068
Andre can't hear you.

33:25.070 --> 33:28.572
He's all the way at
the back of the house,

33:28.574 --> 33:30.640
unfortunately the
sound doesn't travel

33:30.642 --> 33:31.541
that far.

33:33.044 --> 33:35.479
- I'll just get my gloves on
and I'll be out in a minute.

33:35.481 --> 33:37.347
Wouldn't want to get my
fingerprints on anything,

33:37.349 --> 33:39.049
now would I?

33:39.051 --> 33:41.418
- I've, I'm really
uncomfortable, you
have to go now.

33:41.420 --> 33:42.452
- Oh, I'll leave.

33:42.454 --> 33:43.453
- Okay great.

33:43.455 --> 33:45.856
- Just as soon as you leave.

33:52.464 --> 33:55.165
- All right i
checked everything.

33:55.167 --> 33:58.268
- See, now that
wasn't so hard now.

33:58.270 --> 33:59.169
Was it?

34:02.640 --> 34:04.574
Not bad, although the beaujolais

34:04.576 --> 34:07.644
is much better at
this time of year.

34:08.679 --> 34:11.514
- What
happened to Rachel?

34:12.817 --> 34:14.217
- She just left.

34:17.188 --> 34:19.589
Yup, she took her shit.

34:19.591 --> 34:20.590
She's gone.

34:21.525 --> 34:22.692
- She left?

34:22.694 --> 34:24.494
Did she say why?

34:24.496 --> 34:27.764
- No, she took her
shit and

34:27.766 --> 34:28.998
walked out the door.

34:29.001 --> 34:30.199
- That doesn't make any sense

34:30.202 --> 34:31.435
she came here to
have dinner with me.

34:31.437 --> 34:32.803
Why would she just
pick up and go?

34:32.804 --> 34:34.004
- You got me.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.237
You're the date.

34:35.239 --> 34:39.208
I just came by to tell
you about the criminals.

34:39.210 --> 34:42.379
- Well, did you say
anything to her?

34:42.380 --> 34:44.581
- Oh come on Andre, don't
start blaming this on me.

34:44.583 --> 34:47.117
I came here to help you out.

34:47.119 --> 34:49.786
- Help me out, I mean
i don't understand.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.822
This whole night was going
perfect until you showed up.

34:51.824 --> 34:55.358
- Look, you can't just
keep passing the buck man.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.928
Don't blame me for
your shortcomings.

34:57.930 --> 35:00.063
Five and a half
inches, Jesus Christ.

35:00.065 --> 35:00.063
- Excuse me?

35:02.467 --> 35:05.202
- Five and a half inches,
that's what she said.

35:05.204 --> 35:07.204
- Humph, Rachel would never
say anything like that.

35:07.206 --> 35:11.341
- Well maybe you should
call her up and ask her.

35:11.343 --> 35:13.643
Jesus man.

35:13.645 --> 35:16.012
- Who, who do you think you are?

35:16.014 --> 35:20.951
- Just a neighborhood friend
looking out for another guy.

35:20.953 --> 35:22.953
- You're looking out for me?

35:22.955 --> 35:25.255
You are looking out for me?

35:32.196 --> 35:33.830
I'd like you to leave.

35:33.832 --> 35:35.565
- You want me to go?

35:35.567 --> 35:37.200
You got wine and dinner,

35:37.202 --> 35:39.102
I can help you finish.

35:47.879 --> 35:49.613
Did I say something?

35:54.886 --> 35:55.785
- I said

35:57.722 --> 35:58.622
get

35:59.857 --> 36:00.757
the fuck

36:02.226 --> 36:03.126
out.

36:05.463 --> 36:06.429
- Oh, okay,

36:09.200 --> 36:12.669
don't have to tell
me three times.

36:12.671 --> 36:16.306
Look, it's been an
absolute pleasure Andre.

36:17.441 --> 36:20.744
I'll just be getting
outta your hair now.

36:22.113 --> 36:25.982
You know I really like what
you've done to the place.

36:27.218 --> 36:29.953
It's too bad Rachel left.

36:29.955 --> 36:30.921
Then again, if you need anything

36:30.923 --> 36:33.290
I'll just be right up the road.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.025
See you around, huh.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.260
We'll see.

37:23.308 --> 37:27.744
- You gotta
be kidding me.

37:30.282 --> 37:31.181
Charger.

37:49.233 --> 37:52.435
Oh, fuck.

37:52.437 --> 37:53.837
Where's a charger?

37:53.839 --> 37:55.505
Where is a charger?

38:08.352 --> 38:11.655
There's gotta be a
house one somewhere.

38:13.457 --> 38:15.659
I can't believe I can't
find a fucking charger.

38:15.661 --> 38:17.961
What is this guy's house for?

38:41.520 --> 38:42.752
What was that?

38:57.134 --> 38:58.368
So many steps.

39:43.982 --> 39:44.881
Oh fuck.

39:58.329 --> 39:59.929
- Hey it's rach,
you know what to do,

39:59.931 --> 40:02.365
and you when to do it.

40:02.367 --> 40:04.167
- Rachel, it's Andre.

40:04.169 --> 40:05.368
Look, I don't know what the hell

40:05.370 --> 40:07.570
that fucking creep said
to you or did to you

40:07.572 --> 40:11.241
but I'm worried about you
and my phone is fucking dead

40:11.243 --> 40:12.609
and I can't find my charger,

40:12.611 --> 40:14.411
so as soon as you
get this message

40:14.413 --> 40:16.479
give me a call back
on this number.

40:16.481 --> 40:20.283
Please call me back, i
hope you're all right.

40:51.415 --> 40:52.749
Fucking bastard.

40:58.689 --> 41:00.089
- Hey what's up man?

41:00.091 --> 41:01.958
- Huh, you got me.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.927
You son of a bitch.

41:03.929 --> 41:05.094
- What are
you talking about?

41:05.096 --> 41:07.096
- You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

41:07.098 --> 41:08.531
I know that you want
to put me in the show

41:08.533 --> 41:10.133
and that's why you had me here.

41:10.135 --> 41:12.168
It's funny but look,

41:12.170 --> 41:15.438
enough's enough, let's
just call it quits, huh.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.340
- Yeah
right,

41:17.342 --> 41:19.342
you're not on the show, man.

41:21.480 --> 41:24.514
- Who-who-whose house did
you say this was again?

41:24.516 --> 41:26.616
- A good friend
of mine, I told you that.

41:26.618 --> 41:27.617
- Yeah, yeah but I mean,

41:27.619 --> 41:28.852
how well do you know him?

41:28.854 --> 41:30.920
Why does he have
photos of Rachel?

41:30.922 --> 41:32.388
- Wait-w where are you?

41:32.390 --> 41:34.290
- I'm in an office, I needed
a phone because Rachel.

41:34.292 --> 41:36.826
This weirdo came over,
he scared her away,

41:36.828 --> 41:37.961
and I wanted to make
sure that she's all right

41:37.963 --> 41:38.928
but my phone's dead.

41:38.930 --> 41:40.430
So I came to find a phone.

41:40.432 --> 41:41.998
- Look
Andre, just calm dow--

41:42.000 --> 41:43.500
- calm the fuck down, how
am I suppose to calm down?

41:43.502 --> 41:44.968
This is fucking weird.

41:44.970 --> 41:47.237
- Andre listen to
me, I'm not fucking with you.

41:47.239 --> 41:48.471
You're not on the show

41:48.473 --> 41:49.939
and I don't know what's
going on over there

41:49.941 --> 41:51.808
but you got to calm down
before you do something dumb.

41:51.810 --> 41:53.743
Do you hear me?

41:53.745 --> 41:55.178
Didn't your doctor tell you that

41:55.180 --> 41:56.546
because of the concussion
and the memory loss,

41:56.548 --> 41:58.014
that a little bit of
paranoia is normal?

41:58.016 --> 41:59.249
- Yeah, I guess.

41:59.251 --> 42:00.517
- Right?
- - Yeah.

42:00.519 --> 42:01.885
- Andre,
you cannot leave.

42:01.887 --> 42:03.219
You do that and
we are both fucked

42:03.221 --> 42:04.954
because he's gonna find
out I wasn't there.

42:04.956 --> 42:07.323
Trust me Rachel is fine.

42:07.325 --> 42:09.559
- I mean I guess so but...

42:11.161 --> 42:12.729
You gotta see these photos.

42:12.731 --> 42:13.997
- What
are you gonna do?

42:13.999 --> 42:16.065
Walk down the hill
and look for her?

42:16.067 --> 42:17.467
Rachel is fine.

42:17.469 --> 42:19.168
Never mind she shouldn't
have been there at all.

42:19.170 --> 42:20.803
So you do what you
gotta do to grow a pair

42:20.805 --> 42:22.839
and just please man,
get out of that room

42:22.841 --> 42:24.507
and go relax.

42:24.509 --> 42:26.776
- All right that
sounds like a good idea.

42:26.778 --> 42:28.378
Look I'm not trying
to get you in trouble.

42:28.380 --> 42:29.812
- I know man, just--

42:29.814 --> 42:32.448
- I'm gonna go make
myself a nice drink and...

42:32.450 --> 42:33.383
Everything'll be fine.

42:33.385 --> 42:34.684
- You can do this man.

42:34.686 --> 42:37.153
- All right, see ya.

43:49.893 --> 43:54.130
That's
fucking strong.

45:55.018 --> 45:55.918
Hello?

45:56.820 --> 45:58.554
Is anybody in there?

46:06.830 --> 46:10.066
Let's go ahead and
get a look in here.

46:12.035 --> 46:15.505
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

46:15.507 --> 46:18.274
Nope, no you don't
want to come out?

46:24.047 --> 46:25.281
What was that?

48:29.940 --> 48:31.841
- Help me.

48:34.678 --> 48:37.680
Go away.

48:58.602 --> 48:59.502
- Fuck.

49:10.281 --> 49:12.682
What the fuck's going on?

49:12.684 --> 49:14.383
What the fuck

49:14.385 --> 49:15.451
is going on?

51:46.303 --> 51:49.171
Ha-ha-ha, real fucking funny...

55:05.001 --> 55:09.071
Fuck this shit, I'm getting
the fuck outta here.

55:34.031 --> 55:35.264
What the fuck,

55:37.500 --> 55:38.734
am I gonna do.

55:49.979 --> 55:52.381
What the fuck am I gonna do?

55:55.051 --> 55:57.753
I'll tell you what
you're gonna do.

55:57.755 --> 56:00.255
You're gonna man the fuck up.

56:01.991 --> 56:03.726
And get it together.

56:31.821 --> 56:32.721
Oh shit.

58:33.476 --> 58:36.211
Holy.

58:46.856 --> 58:48.090
What the fuck?

59:49.419 --> 59:51.253
- What are you doing?

59:57.160 --> 59:58.060
Touch me.

01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:02.831
Touch me.

01:00:12.408 --> 01:00:15.077
So what are you gonna do to me?

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:25.520
Play with it.

01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:38.033
Is that a toy?

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:43.939
Why aren't you talking?

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:47.376
Babe?

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:54.383
Come here.

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:06.294
What is that?

01:01:33.923 --> 01:01:35.157
Where are you?

01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:42.097
- Huh, what the, the fuck?

01:01:57.014 --> 01:01:58.980
Oh,

01:02:02.585 --> 01:02:06.488
oh my god,.

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:14.096
Ah, shit.

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:21.136
I can't fucking see anything.

01:02:21.138 --> 01:02:22.471
I'm not trying.

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:26.041
I'm go find the circuit
breaker, or something.

01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:28.410
It's fucking dark as hell.

01:02:28.412 --> 01:02:29.945
I don't know what to fucking do.

01:02:29.947 --> 01:02:32.581
I think someone's
fucking with me, right.

01:03:47.424 --> 01:03:48.723
What the fuck?

01:03:48.725 --> 01:03:49.624
Oh, shit.

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:58.233
Oh shit,

01:03:58.235 --> 01:04:00.468
oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:12.480
- Andre?

01:04:12.482 --> 01:04:15.050
- Rachel, is that you?

01:05:58.922 --> 01:05:59.821
What the?

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:03.458
Oh man, oh my god.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.726
What the fuck was that?

01:06:04.728 --> 01:06:06.695
What the fuck was that?

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:11.166
Oh my god.

01:06:11.168 --> 01:06:12.400
What the fuck?

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:14.602
Holy shit.

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:20.542
Holy shit.

01:06:21.778 --> 01:06:22.811
What the fuck? Get the fuck off.

01:06:22.813 --> 01:06:24.212
Fucking shit.

01:06:24.214 --> 01:06:25.814
What the fuck? Get
the fuck off me.

01:06:25.816 --> 01:06:27.515
Get the fuck off of me.

01:06:32.722 --> 01:06:36.958
What the fuck?

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:45.600
Oh, holy shit.

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:33.207
- Get down

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:34.042
do not get off the ground.

01:08:34.044 --> 01:08:35.176
- Fuck that,

01:08:35.178 --> 01:08:36.344
he's in the house.

01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:37.578
What are you doing?

01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:39.247
- Put your hands
behind your back.

01:08:39.249 --> 01:08:40.582
- He's in the house!

01:08:40.584 --> 01:08:41.716
Ah,

01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:43.651

01:08:43.653 --> 01:08:44.853
He's in the house.

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:46.087
- Just relax

01:08:46.089 --> 01:08:47.020
- I'm telling you
have the wrong guy.

01:08:47.023 --> 01:08:48.323
He's in the fucking house.

01:08:48.325 --> 01:08:49.491
- Relax.

01:08:49.493 --> 01:08:50.390
- You?

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:52.993
What the fuck you?

01:08:53.828 --> 01:08:56.029
Ah, it's fucking tight.

01:08:56.032 --> 01:08:57.064
- Stop, stay.

01:08:57.067 --> 01:08:57.999
- I can prove it,

01:08:58.001 --> 01:08:59.399
just play the fucking video.

01:08:59.402 --> 01:09:01.069
All right there's
a video on there.

01:09:01.071 --> 01:09:02.270
It'll show you,

01:09:02.272 --> 01:09:04.671
just play the video, please.

01:10:41.837 --> 01:10:42.737
What?

01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:50.111
Oh no, no.

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:07.061
No.

01:11:07.063 --> 01:11:08.463
No way.

01:11:08.465 --> 01:11:09.497
No.

01:11:09.499 --> 01:11:10.698
- Good luck man.

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:11.766
- Thank you
i appreciate it.

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:12.834
Left tip.

01:11:12.836 --> 01:11:14.068
No.

01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:15.903
They said that I was
in a car accident

01:11:15.905 --> 01:11:17.238
and I got a concussion.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:18.139
No, no.

01:11:19.408 --> 01:11:21.009
- I really like what
you've done with the place.

01:11:21.011 --> 01:11:23.444
- Hopefully
something will jog my memory.

01:11:26.383 --> 01:11:29.217
- No.

01:11:37.192 --> 01:11:38.159
Oh, my god.

01:11:38.994 --> 01:11:42.730
No, no this isn't real.

01:11:42.732 --> 01:11:44.299
Fuck, this can't be real.

01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:46.567
Turn it off. Just turn it off.

01:11:46.569 --> 01:11:47.468
Please.

01:11:57.079 --> 01:11:58.579
It's a bad dream.

01:12:13.462 --> 01:12:15.797
I didn't want to do it to her.

01:12:15.799 --> 01:12:18.633
He made me do this to her.

01:12:18.635 --> 01:12:20.501
I didn't want to do it.

01:12:24.273 --> 01:12:26.341
Please stop fucking with me.

01:12:26.343 --> 01:12:27.742
I can't take it.

01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:34.449
Look at the screen you pussy.

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:37.552
You boys sure went all out.

01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:39.721
I mean,

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:41.589
all this

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:43.358
for me.

01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:48.830
I got to admit.

01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:50.732
I'm kind of flattered.

01:13:04.279 --> 01:13:09.117
All this bullshit hiding all
around the place, chasing me,

01:13:09.119 --> 01:13:11.586
and you actually
thought for a moment

01:13:11.588 --> 01:13:13.354
that you had me scared.

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:24.732
Me scared?

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:28.870
Yeah, maybe that bitch Andre.

01:13:33.275 --> 01:13:36.177
You see what I have to put with,

01:13:36.179 --> 01:13:38.379
this fucking pussy,

01:13:38.381 --> 01:13:40.047
day in and day out.

01:13:46.288 --> 01:13:48.322
I can't even fucking
look at him anymore.

01:13:48.324 --> 01:13:50.224
Look at him, pathetic.

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:56.731
She fucking enjoyed
every second of it.

01:13:56.733 --> 01:13:57.899
Every second.

01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:04.806
Fucking idiot.

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:10.545
If you'd only just listen.

01:14:13.682 --> 01:14:15.650
Can't control anything.

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:27.795
Adam controls everything.
