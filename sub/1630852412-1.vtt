having an affair.

One night, I came down
with this terrible flu,

35:02.307 --> 35:04.481

the neighbor's car

35:04.619 --> 35:06.311
to take me to the hospital.

on that back seat, delirious.

on the base.

that she trapped him

as he was.

Your father was a part

2:02:10.495 --> 2:02:13.326

After your dad left, I tried
my best to feel nothing
