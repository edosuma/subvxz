WEBVTT

00:51.852 --> 00:53.554
IDs?

00:58.692 --> 01:01.395
(beeping)

01:01.429 --> 01:03.131
Here you go.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.665
Head to the door.

01:05.866 --> 01:08.636
Relief crew Captains Ross and
Miller ready when you are.

01:08.669 --> 01:09.837
Great. Got your pad?

01:09.870 --> 01:12.106
AIRMAN:
Yep. Go.
Lima Alpha.

01:12.140 --> 01:12.873
Delta Zulu.

01:12.906 --> 01:13.841
Send them down.

01:13.874 --> 01:16.076
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

01:22.783 --> 01:24.785
(phone clatters)

01:28.256 --> 01:30.824
Beautiful day.

01:30.858 --> 01:33.361
It was stupid.

01:33.394 --> 01:36.764
I didn't even look at the sky
before we got in here today.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.474
Morning.
Morning, guys.

01:51.312 --> 01:52.746
Eager to leave, gentlemen?

01:52.780 --> 01:54.148
Got five days off.

01:54.182 --> 01:57.151
Gonna visit my fiancÃ©e's family
in Denver.

01:57.185 --> 01:59.420
Wish me luck.
Ah, come on. They're
gonna love you.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.589
Good luck.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.657
Good.
Good.

02:03.691 --> 02:04.692
MILLER:
Gentlemen. Enjoy.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.260
Thank you.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.362
(beeping, whirring)

02:47.868 --> 02:49.737
(alarm blaring)

02:50.871 --> 02:53.741
God bless America.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.452
(beeping, whirring)

03:21.402 --> 03:23.737
(phone ringing)

03:23.771 --> 03:26.474
MILLER (over phone):
Lieutenant Zindower?

03:26.507 --> 03:27.741
Are we good?

03:27.775 --> 03:30.478
Blast doors secure,
air vent is secure.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.748
Huh?
(screams)

03:38.419 --> 03:39.853
(beeping, whirring)

03:47.795 --> 03:49.963
(alarm blaring)

03:58.906 --> 04:00.308
(beeping, whirring)

04:24.865 --> 04:26.033
Captain Miller.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.701
Your launch cannot
be countermanded.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.603
Proceed.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.972
Copy.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.474
We're good to go.

04:33.507 --> 04:37.044
Begin verifying
the unlock codes.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.615
*

05:01.101 --> 05:02.770
Where's Kensi?

05:02.803 --> 05:05.839
We took separate cars.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.841
What'd you do?

05:07.875 --> 05:09.610
Who says I did anything?

05:11.512 --> 05:15.616
If you have to know,
I criticized her grilled cheese.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.485
Is that a euphemism?

05:17.518 --> 05:19.953
No. No, I just consider myself
a little bit of a connoisseur

05:19.987 --> 05:21.121
of grilled cheese.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.792
Uh, cheese, bread,
clogged arteries.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.427
Why complicate it?
You know, 'cause I like

05:26.460 --> 05:28.429
a couple different types
of cheeses, you know?

05:28.462 --> 05:29.830
Maybe a nice Tillamook.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.799
Slice of tomato,
a little bit of onion.

05:31.832 --> 05:32.666
Too much to ask?

05:32.700 --> 05:34.902
And for that,
you went to bed angry.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.773
SAM: And, evidently,
woke up angry.

05:39.807 --> 05:42.443
No. She's not-- I mean,
she's not really angry.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.614
This is so much more
than grilled cheese.

05:48.649 --> 05:49.883
ERIC:
Kensi, Ops.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.819
ASAP.
There's a secure video call.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.154
What's up?

05:54.187 --> 05:55.456
We don't know.

05:55.489 --> 05:56.790
Mosley cleared the room.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.659
Of course she did.

05:58.692 --> 05:59.827
(Kensi sighs)

05:59.860 --> 06:02.430
(sighs)
Okay.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.435
Executive Director Cole, OSI.

06:07.468 --> 06:10.438
Special Agent Kensi Blye, NCIS.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.906
Agent Blye,
did you have a relationship

06:12.940 --> 06:16.610
with an Air Force Captain
Kevin Miller?

06:16.644 --> 06:18.812
Uh, I remember
a Lieutenant Miller.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.848
I was dating him

06:20.881 --> 06:22.416
when working with the
Seventh Fleet in Tokyo,

06:22.450 --> 06:23.917
but this was ten years ago.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.620
We're sending an Air Force
security detail to pick you up.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.722
Okay. What's going on?

06:28.756 --> 06:30.157
That's on a need-to-know basis.

06:30.190 --> 06:33.461
This is a critical
national security situation.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.161
Where am I going?

06:34.194 --> 06:35.996
Edwards Air Force Base.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.498
Take your go-bag.

06:37.531 --> 06:38.999
I'm flying out of Edwards?

06:39.032 --> 06:41.101
You've got about seven minutes
until the car arrives.

06:42.169 --> 06:45.539
If I were you,
I would move fast, Agent Blye.

06:45.573 --> 06:47.575
Yes, ma'am.

06:51.712 --> 06:52.880
What's going on?

06:52.913 --> 06:55.048
I don't know. Walk with me.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.785
This has something to do
with a guy I dated in Tokyo,

06:57.818 --> 06:59.620
a Captain Kevin Miller.

06:59.653 --> 07:00.821
You never mentioned him.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.656
Because it was nothing. We dated
for less than three months.

07:02.690 --> 07:03.857
Either way, an Air Force
security detail

07:03.891 --> 07:05.192
is picking me up
in five minutes.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.560
Air Force?

07:06.594 --> 07:07.961
Miller was Air Force.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.963
I'm flying out of Edwards,
they wouldn't tell me where.

07:09.997 --> 07:10.931
I got to go.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.177
(indistinct chatter)

07:35.523 --> 07:37.024
COLE: Agent Blye?
Yeah.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.059
FBI Special Agent Mark Monroe.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.661
Hey. How you doing?
Hey.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.896
Let's go over here.
We got to be fast.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.532
You understand you've arrived

07:44.565 --> 07:46.700
at an Air Force missile
launch control facility?

07:46.734 --> 07:47.568
Yeah, I'm putting it together.

07:47.601 --> 07:50.003
And you understand
the two-man rule?

07:50.037 --> 07:52.039
Yes. Two people have to turn
their keys simultaneously

07:52.072 --> 07:53.173
to launch a nuclear missile.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.609
That's correct. What most
civilians don't understand

07:55.643 --> 07:58.211
is when two launch control
centers work together,

07:58.245 --> 08:00.781
a launch from either one
can't be countermanded.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.716
So nobody on the outside
can stop the launch

08:02.750 --> 08:04.585
of a nuclear missile?
What are you telling me?

08:04.618 --> 08:06.954
At 0700 hours,
three Air Force officers

08:06.987 --> 08:08.956
took over two
launch control centers.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.559
Because they now command
two LCCs,

08:11.592 --> 08:13.861
we have no way to stop
their launch orders.

08:13.894 --> 08:14.995
So you're telling me
they have the capability

08:15.028 --> 08:16.797
to launch a nuclear missile?

08:16.830 --> 08:21.168
No. I'm telling you they can
launch 50 nuclear missiles.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.038
All right.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.575
If they have the codes, why
haven't they pushed the button?

08:27.608 --> 08:29.109
We're monitoring
their activity.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.578
It seems like they're
retargeting the missiles

08:30.611 --> 08:32.880
to non-predetermined
destinations.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.783
It's a complex procedure, takes
about 15 minutes per missile.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.117
Where are they targeting them?

08:37.150 --> 08:39.186
Let me remind you that
you're not here as an agent.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.021
You're here because of your
personal relationship

08:41.054 --> 08:42.155
with Captain Miller.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.024
Yes, I understand that.
Thank you.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.893
Is there any way
we can breach the LCC,

08:45.926 --> 08:47.160
take them out with gas?

08:47.194 --> 08:48.295
Air intake has been sealed.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.630
They're completely
self-sufficient

08:49.663 --> 08:50.964
in terms of air, food and water.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.100
It is a room designed
to withstand a nuclear bomb.

08:53.133 --> 08:56.169
But let me repeat,
you're not here as an agent.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.005
I am an expert
in tactical assaults.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.773
Yeah, so is my SWAT team,
and they're on site.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.609
You're here to speak
with Captain Miller.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.611
See if you can uncover
any information,

09:03.644 --> 09:04.945
and, best-case scenario,

09:04.978 --> 09:06.179
convince him
not to go through with this.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.181
That's fine, but you need to
understand that I knew Miller

09:08.215 --> 09:10.183
a long time ago, and it was
only for a few months.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.019
We are trying to find
anyone we can who can persuade

09:12.052 --> 09:14.622
those three officers
down there not to launch.

09:14.655 --> 09:17.057
In terms of Miller, you and
his sister are the only people

09:17.090 --> 09:18.191
we could get here in time.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.027
His parents
and grandparents are dead.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.995
No other family
or meaningful relationships.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.865
We only need to convince one
person down there not to launch,

09:24.898 --> 09:26.867
and the operation is over.
KENSI: Okay.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.603
Right now, you and his sister
are just about all we've got.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.873
Let's go.
Okay.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.752
MOSLEY: This is
urgent, guys.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.054
Air Force Captain
Miller, Ross...

09:47.087 --> 09:48.088
Air Force?

09:48.121 --> 09:50.023
Why are we
looking into this?

09:50.057 --> 09:51.859
Air Force Office
of Special Investigations

09:51.892 --> 09:53.961
is working on this,
as well as FBI.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.395
All hands on deck.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.764
Yes.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.299
Here are the three
people of interest.

09:59.332 --> 10:04.304
Air Force Captains Miller, Ross
and Lieutenant Zindower.

10:04.337 --> 10:07.941
I want you to dismantle
their lives piece by piece.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.410
I want e-mails, phone records,
travel records, financials.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.945
I want everything.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.113
What have they done?

10:13.146 --> 10:15.015
All I can say, right now,

10:15.048 --> 10:16.750
is these two men and one woman

10:16.784 --> 10:19.252
have committed an extreme
act of terrorism.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.321
So you know what they've done,
you're just not gonna tell us?

10:21.354 --> 10:22.990
Correct.

10:23.023 --> 10:26.093
We have the highest level
of clearance.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.928
And after the mole, we have the
most scrutinized office in...

10:27.961 --> 10:29.997
Just the very knowledge
of what they've done

10:30.030 --> 10:32.432
jeopardizes national security.

10:32.465 --> 10:36.036
Now, is that your determination,
or is this coming from SecNav?

10:36.069 --> 10:38.271
SecNav. I have nothing
to do with this.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.140
There must be something
you can tell us.

10:40.173 --> 10:43.076
There is. Have you heard
of the Patton Project?

10:43.110 --> 10:45.145
Yeah. It's supposed
to be an urban myth.
What is it?

10:45.178 --> 10:48.115
It's named after General Patton
and, supposedly,

10:48.148 --> 10:50.083
it's a military
within the military.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.985
Well, it's a group that
believes in a more aggressive

10:52.019 --> 10:53.420
and violent military action.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.355
They advocate all-out war
on Muslims

10:55.388 --> 10:58.726
and condone genocide as a path
to U.S. national security.

10:58.759 --> 10:59.927
So, just to clarify,

10:59.960 --> 11:01.829
we think that these guys
are a part of that?

11:01.862 --> 11:05.132
Air Force OSI has reason
to believe that, yes.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.701
There's a clock
on this. Move.

11:07.735 --> 11:10.337
Okay.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.005
Well, let's see what kind
of connections we can find

11:12.039 --> 11:13.140
between the three officers.

11:13.173 --> 11:16.877
So, Callen, when, uh,
when Kensi was brought up here,

11:16.910 --> 11:19.179
she was told it was about one of
her ex-boyfriends, Kevin Miller.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.413
I gave the information
to Eric and Nell.

11:20.447 --> 11:23.083
None of us are supposed to have
access to that information.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.085
You want to run
and tell Mosley?

11:27.054 --> 11:28.188
What'd you find?

11:28.221 --> 11:30.090
Miller and the
other two officers

11:30.123 --> 11:32.259
work at an Air Force
missile alert facility

11:32.292 --> 11:33.493
in Colorado.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.195
SAM: They launch
control officers?

11:35.228 --> 11:36.496
Yes, they are.
We also saw that

11:36.529 --> 11:39.166
alert codes went out
from the Colorado facility.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.401
FBI SWAT was dispatched
from Denver.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.070
Something's going on there.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.838
They've taken over
that facility?

11:44.872 --> 11:46.073
Or worse, they've attempted

11:46.106 --> 11:47.775
to commandeer
launch control center.

11:47.808 --> 11:50.110
Meaning what? They're trying
to launch a nuclear weapon?

11:50.143 --> 11:51.311
Wait, is that even possible?

11:51.344 --> 11:53.881
We blew up a fully-armed ICBM
in Arkansas.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.883
We lost a 3.8 megaton
nuclear bomb

11:55.916 --> 11:57.918
in a swamp in North Carolina.
Which we never recovered.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.821
So, yes, it is
definitely possible.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.156
Whatever's happening,
it's big and it's long-term.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.793
This took years of planning
and it's heavily financed.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.360
Let's do what
the assistant director said.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.062
Let's tear apart
their lives.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.130
We're looking for any
connection we can

12:10.163 --> 12:11.131
amongst these three officers.

12:16.336 --> 12:19.106
Let me see if I have them
on the line.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.442
WOMAN:
It can't be Kevin.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.977
I mean, he wouldn't do this.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.112
WOMAN 2:
You have to calm down.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.213
WOMAN 1: No!
You're trying to tell me

12:26.246 --> 12:27.815
he wants to kill
millions of people.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.150
He may have developed
an extreme political agenda.

12:30.183 --> 12:33.854
No! No, I don't believe
this. This is crazy!

12:33.887 --> 12:35.088
I need to get out of
here. This is insane.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.089
You can't leave, Tiffany.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.991
You...
Excuse me.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.192
I knew Kevin.
Can I talk to her?

12:41.261 --> 12:43.496
It's okay.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.998
Thanks.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.133
Wait, you knew Kevin?

12:46.166 --> 12:49.102
Yeah, um, we dated, actually,

12:49.136 --> 12:51.204
and-and I loved him.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.140
What? When? I...

12:53.173 --> 12:55.042
It was about ten years ago.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.444
And by the way, this does not
sound like the guy that I knew.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.146
Because it's not.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.214
That's why we're here,
to figure it out.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.917
I mean, this is crazy.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.253
These men, they just,
they just show up at my house,

13:06.286 --> 13:08.355
they take me away
from my baby boy, and he...

13:08.388 --> 13:09.957
Wait a minute, wh...
you have a son?

13:09.990 --> 13:11.391
Yes.
How old is he?

13:11.424 --> 13:12.960
He's two months.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.095
Who's with him now?
My husband.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.831
Okay. Sorry. I just,
I have a four-month-old.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.466
Really?
Yeah.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.569
(laughs)
I'm exhausted.

13:22.602 --> 13:25.038
Look, this is crazy.

13:25.072 --> 13:27.140
Don't let anybody in here
tell you that it's not.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.142
Thank you.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.311
ERIC: All three officers
are from different parts

13:31.344 --> 13:33.280
of the country,
but it seems that they all

13:33.313 --> 13:36.083
went through Air Force
ROTC programs.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.118
None went
to the Air Force Academy?

13:38.151 --> 13:39.419
Were they attending
the same university?

13:39.452 --> 13:40.921
ERIC: No, they all went
to different schools.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.323
Ah, here's an
interesting connection.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.859
Psychology Professor
Ted Holmes

13:45.893 --> 13:48.295
taught at all three universities
the officers attended.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.997
Were any of them
his students?

13:50.030 --> 13:52.032
NELL: No.
DEEKS: Where's Holmes now?

13:52.065 --> 13:54.467
Um, L.A., Glenforest
University.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.468
Want to talk to him?

13:55.502 --> 13:57.604
Oh, yeah. Send us the address.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.010
We've got him on the line.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.311
All right.
Maybe someone's been
influencing him.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.512
You never know.
Agent Blye.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.514
Yeah?
Come with me, please.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.216
I'll be right back.

14:14.922 --> 14:17.090
Captain Ross, if you could
just listen to me

14:17.124 --> 14:18.325
for one second, please.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.427
We are the ones with our fingers
on the button.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.195
That means you listen to us.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.231
We want to make
a statement to the press.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.198
Can you do that?

14:25.232 --> 14:26.666
Well, I can try, but...

14:26.699 --> 14:28.068
Then do it.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.436
I work for the government
just like you.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.471
I answer to higher-ups.
It'll take time.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.006
Let me know
what the statement is

14:33.040 --> 14:34.341
and I'll try and get it cleared.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.409
We want to end the Muslim
problem in one day.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.611
Like a cancer,
we will cut it out.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.513
We know this is extreme
and it may appear brutal,

14:40.547 --> 14:43.250
but it is the only way
to ultimately take care

14:43.283 --> 14:45.418
of the danger that Muslims pose
to the United States.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.488
By "cut it out" you mean
launch nuclear strikes

14:48.521 --> 14:50.223
against predominantly
Muslim countries?

14:50.257 --> 14:51.558
Yes.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.593
I'm sure that you're
monitoring our targeting

14:53.626 --> 14:55.128
from the other LCCs.

14:55.162 --> 14:56.229
Yes.

14:56.263 --> 14:59.066
Then you know exactly which
cities we are targeting.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.433
Don't ask dumb questions.

15:00.467 --> 15:03.303
Just making sure
everything is clear.

15:03.336 --> 15:07.374
Imagine how much safer
and how much better

15:07.407 --> 15:11.044
the world will be tomorrow
morning waking up

15:11.078 --> 15:13.380
with no Mecca or Damascus

15:13.413 --> 15:16.383
or Tehran or Kabul.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.986
Terror wiped out forever...

15:19.019 --> 15:21.388
all in the matter
of a one-hour timeframe.

15:21.421 --> 15:25.025
I get your point.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.994
You feel the same way,
Captain Miller?

15:27.027 --> 15:29.262
Yes.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.630
Makes sense.

15:30.663 --> 15:33.433
War is war.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.568
We're killing slowly
and ineffectively now.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.204
Let's just get it done.

15:37.237 --> 15:41.008
May sound crazy, but not if
you really think about it.

15:41.041 --> 15:44.477
Uh, Captain Miller, I have
a friend of yours here.

15:44.511 --> 15:47.314
She found out what was happening
and wanted to speak with you.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.351
Kevin?

15:51.384 --> 15:54.954
Hi, it's Kensi Blye.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.325
Kev, can you hear me?

15:58.358 --> 16:00.427
(chuckles)
I hear you.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.296
Blast from the past, huh?

16:03.330 --> 16:06.299
Why did they get you
involved in this?

16:06.333 --> 16:08.301
I work for the government.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.037
I heard what was going on.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.272
Um, I thought I could help.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.374
Good.
Is there anything I can do?

16:14.407 --> 16:17.310
No. We just need to get
the statement to the press.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.379
Yeah, I heard.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.781
Sounds pretty simple.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.650
You know you launch
these missiles,

16:23.683 --> 16:26.319
it could trigger
a worldwide nuclear holocaust.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.088
You really, really want
to be responsible

16:28.121 --> 16:30.023
for the death of millions
of innocent people?

16:30.057 --> 16:31.691
The wars, the terror attacks,

16:31.724 --> 16:34.294
they could go on
for hundreds of years.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.762
Think of how many innocents
will die that way.

16:35.795 --> 16:38.398
Is this a Christian point of
view that you're coming from?

16:38.431 --> 16:40.200
Kevin.

16:40.233 --> 16:43.503
Kev, this doesn't sound
Christian.

16:43.536 --> 16:44.671
I'm just trying to understand...

16:44.704 --> 16:46.373
All right,
this conversation is over.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.275
Call us when you can prove

16:48.308 --> 16:49.676
that you've issued our
statement to the press.

16:49.709 --> 16:53.213
I need assurances in exchange
for the press release.

16:53.246 --> 16:56.316
I assure you
you will have a front-row seat

16:56.349 --> 16:58.385
to watch the end
of the war on terror.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.306
The TA said he'd be
in here somewhere.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.407
There he is.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.511
Professor Ted Holmes.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.279
NCIS.

17:26.313 --> 17:28.448
What's this about?

17:28.481 --> 17:29.782
Oh, we have
a little situation

17:29.816 --> 17:31.684
with three Air Force officers
you may know.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.653
The names Kevin Miller,
Anna Ross

17:33.686 --> 17:35.555
or Gerald Zindower
mean anything to you?

17:35.588 --> 17:38.191
No, were they, uh, were they
students of mine?

17:38.225 --> 17:39.392
SAM:
Not that we know of.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.428
But you did teach
at their universities.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.130
NELL (over comms):
Hey, we just found out

17:43.163 --> 17:44.731
that Holmes has posted
under pseudonyms

17:44.764 --> 17:47.367
on several Darknet,
right-wing websites.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.436
I, uh, don't remember them.
I'm sorry.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.504
Class isn't over
yet. Sit down.

17:51.538 --> 17:54.541
You ever hear of a political
group called the Patton Project?

17:54.574 --> 17:58.211
I don't actually have
to speak to you.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.180
Well, under the circumstances,
you kind of do.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.248
I want a lawyer.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.382
And I want a Maserati.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.450
Anybody else want anything?

18:03.483 --> 18:05.452
I want to be alone in a room
with the professor.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.520
CALLEN: All right, now,
that sounds a little scary.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.189
Hey, you have no idea.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.662
(gasps, grunts)

18:21.768 --> 18:23.403
(chuckles)

18:26.239 --> 18:28.875
You think we can get Tiffany
talking to Captain Miller,

18:28.908 --> 18:30.410
keep him occupied?

18:30.443 --> 18:32.212
You did calm her down.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.481
Yeah, uh, I mean,
I can talk to her,

18:34.514 --> 18:35.415
maybe tell her
what to say to him.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.816
We need to distract them.

18:36.849 --> 18:37.884
Distract them from what?

18:37.917 --> 18:39.586
This way.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.693
This tunnel is usually
filled with sand,

18:46.726 --> 18:48.361
it's a direct route
to the LCC.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.363
We're almost done
excavating it.

18:50.397 --> 18:53.233
You want to breach the LCC
through this tunnel?

18:53.266 --> 18:55.268
MONROE: This escape tunnel
is the only direct route.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.636
Okay. I'll talk to Tiffany.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.508
It's just a phone call.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.276
I just, I don't understand
what I'm supposed to say.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.878
Like, "Hey, Kev. Please don't
blow up the world."

19:05.912 --> 19:08.915
No. This is about
saving his life.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.550
You got to
connect with him.

19:10.583 --> 19:11.718
You're his only family.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.386
Okay?

19:13.420 --> 19:14.454
Think of it this way.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.889
It's another Sunday phone
call to your brother.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.225
That's all it is.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.427
You can do this.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.494
Will you be right there?

19:21.528 --> 19:24.931
I will absolutely be right
there, right next to you.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.567
Okay.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.236
Okay.
Okay.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.503
MONROE: They're no longer
answering comms,

19:30.537 --> 19:31.971
so we'll put you through
the speakers down there.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.607
Yeah. Say "hello" when
he points at you, okay?

19:34.641 --> 19:36.643
Okay, got it.

19:39.646 --> 19:40.947
Kevin?

19:40.980 --> 19:43.516
Can you hear me?

19:43.550 --> 19:45.518
Kevin, it's Tiffany.

19:48.655 --> 19:49.956
Ignore it.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.524
It's my sister.

19:51.558 --> 19:54.561
Kevin?

19:54.594 --> 19:56.229
Hey, Tiff.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.530
What are you doing here?

19:59.566 --> 20:00.867
I heard you were in trouble,

20:00.900 --> 20:02.369
so I'm here
for my little brother.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.638
I just, I heard you were
in some trouble,

20:05.672 --> 20:06.973
so I'm here
for my little brother.

20:07.006 --> 20:07.974
KENSI:
Plus I miss you.

20:08.007 --> 20:11.344
Plus I just miss you.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.679
I miss you, too.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.581
Are you okay down there?

20:14.614 --> 20:18.618
Yeah. I'm good.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.553
How's my nephew?

20:20.587 --> 20:24.524
Uh, he's good.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.526
Yeah. I mean, he's got
a cold, but he's good.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.695
Your husband fusses
over him too much.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.531
Michael fusses over him
too much.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.266
He's a good dad.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.537
I love that little guy.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.671
Me, too.

20:38.705 --> 20:41.274
He's amazing.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.712
Have you questioned Holmes?

20:45.745 --> 20:46.946
Kind of holding off until we
have a better understanding

20:46.979 --> 20:48.715
of what we're dealing with.
We've already
been over this.

20:48.748 --> 20:49.916
We can't interrogate
anyone if we don't know

20:49.949 --> 20:50.917
what the hell
we're looking for.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.752
I told you.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.588
The very knowledge
of what they've done

20:55.622 --> 20:58.591
endangers national security.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.595
They've taken over
the launch control center

21:02.629 --> 21:04.697
and they're attempting
to launch a nuclear missile?

21:04.731 --> 21:07.334
I can neither
confirm nor deny,

21:07.367 --> 21:09.702
but if that hypothetical
were to occur,

21:09.736 --> 21:11.538
there would be more
than one missile.

21:14.607 --> 21:17.844
So, how far right would you say
your politics go?

21:17.877 --> 21:19.979
The love of one's country

21:20.012 --> 21:22.349
doesn't fall
on the political spectrum.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.751
Hmm, but just for
conversation starter,

21:24.784 --> 21:25.985
how do you feel
about, say, fascism?

21:26.018 --> 21:28.555
It's not the American system.

21:28.588 --> 21:31.424
Feel like
there's a "but" coming.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.361
There's a certain efficiency
to that type of government

21:34.394 --> 21:36.729
that can be very... seductive.

21:36.763 --> 21:37.964
This is interesting.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.466
I had Eric pull

21:39.499 --> 21:41.000
everything they could find
on Holmes's classes.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.670
He would put out surveys to
the student body every year

21:43.703 --> 21:45.338
that were designed to
reveal the psychology

21:45.372 --> 21:46.806
behind the student's
political beliefs.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.075
So Holmes might have been
using the survey

21:49.108 --> 21:52.679
to find ROTC students with
right-wing radical politics.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.113
It's worth a shot.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.548
Deeks, you
hearing this?

21:55.582 --> 21:58.618
So, we know about
the surveys.

21:58.651 --> 21:59.752
Yeah.

21:59.786 --> 22:00.920
We know that's how
you identified

22:00.953 --> 22:02.655
Ross, Miller
and Zindower.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.658
I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.894
That's it, we got him.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.696
(soft chuckle)

22:09.729 --> 22:11.130
See, you're a terrible liar.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.899
And you give us
a few more hours,

22:12.932 --> 22:14.066
we're going to figure out

22:14.100 --> 22:15.368
how you got
the students' information

22:15.402 --> 22:16.769
to the recruiter
for the Patton Project.

22:16.803 --> 22:18.671
Hey.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.910
I would very much
like a lawyer.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.712
You're not getting a lawyer.

22:25.745 --> 22:26.946
Ross, Miller, and Zindower

22:26.979 --> 22:28.615
have taken over
a launch control center.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.049
They are attempting
to launch

22:30.082 --> 22:32.084
dozens of intercontinental
nuclear missiles.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.726
Let me ask you...

22:39.759 --> 22:43.062
how many men or women
would somebody need to recruit

22:43.095 --> 22:45.765
in order to put three people

22:45.798 --> 22:48.635
in positions
to launch those weapons?

22:48.668 --> 22:49.669
I don't know.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.103
Why don't you tell us?

22:51.137 --> 22:54.474
Some might lose their nerve.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.876
Some might not get funneled
to the right base.

22:56.909 --> 22:59.412
And that's just one mission.

22:59.446 --> 23:03.450
What if there were
many, many missions

23:03.483 --> 23:05.918
across all branches
of the military?

23:05.952 --> 23:07.654
What's your point?

23:07.687 --> 23:11.891
You could be surrounded
and you wouldn't even know it.

23:19.866 --> 23:21.501
He's saying there's
other active agents.

23:21.534 --> 23:23.670
They could be located in
another launch facility.

23:23.703 --> 23:24.671
He could be lying.

23:24.704 --> 23:25.905
We can't take that chance.

23:25.938 --> 23:26.739
Bring up Ops.

23:28.741 --> 23:29.842
Let's get in touch
with the Pentagon.

23:29.876 --> 23:32.712
They need to reach out to
every branch of the military.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.447
Have them pull
any officer on duty

23:34.481 --> 23:35.782
who has attended
a ROTC programs

23:35.815 --> 23:37.517
at a school where
Holmes taught.

23:37.550 --> 23:38.518
On it.

23:38.551 --> 23:39.986
So it's true.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.822
These guys are really
trying to launch an ICBM?

23:42.855 --> 23:45.458
Listen, if this information
gets out to Russia or China,

23:45.492 --> 23:46.559
they may make
a preemptive strike

23:46.593 --> 23:48.027
against the launch center.
That is not gonna happen.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.630
DEEKS: How do
you know that?

23:54.701 --> 23:56.636
SAM:
Hypothetically speaking,

23:56.669 --> 24:00.039
why would a group
like the Patton Project

24:00.072 --> 24:02.542
want to launch nuclear weapons?

24:02.575 --> 24:03.543
Hypothetically,

24:03.576 --> 24:07.547
I would guess...

24:07.580 --> 24:09.749
they believe
these powerful weapons

24:09.782 --> 24:12.985
have sat unutilized
for decades...
SAM: Mmm.

24:13.019 --> 24:14.787
...when they could
be used to solve

24:14.821 --> 24:16.589
the world's worst problems.

24:16.623 --> 24:19.492
Nuclear weapons
can't solve hunger...

24:19.526 --> 24:22.094
over-population...

24:22.128 --> 24:23.796
global warming...

24:23.830 --> 24:27.199
They would be used to solve
the Islamic problem...

24:27.233 --> 24:28.868
once and for all.

24:28.901 --> 24:31.538
Cut it out
like a cancer.

24:31.571 --> 24:32.905
You know...

24:32.939 --> 24:34.907
that would make me a cancer.

24:34.941 --> 24:36.843
And my children.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.814
I am a devout
Muslim.

24:43.683 --> 24:46.118
Allahu Akbar.

24:49.221 --> 24:52.925
Hypothetically, I guess that
would make you a cancer...

24:55.962 --> 24:57.730
...in their eyes.

25:01.233 --> 25:02.769
Let's keep him talking.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.804
Bring up a positive
childhood memory.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.873
(radio switch clicks)

25:06.906 --> 25:08.841
(chuckles)
Hey, remember that time

25:08.875 --> 25:11.110
I snuck you out of the house
and-and took you to the park

25:11.143 --> 25:13.112
and Mom thought
you'd been kidnapped?

25:13.145 --> 25:15.181
MILLER:
She called the cops.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.716
She tried to act mad

25:16.749 --> 25:17.850
when we got home,

25:17.884 --> 25:19.085
but she was so happy to see us.

25:19.118 --> 25:22.521
TIFFANY: I know, she just kept
hugging and crying. (laughs)

25:24.190 --> 25:25.157
(loud thump)

25:25.191 --> 25:27.193
(muffled banging, dragging)

25:39.371 --> 25:40.907
(muffled boom)

25:40.940 --> 25:44.944
Hey, what was that sound?

25:44.977 --> 25:45.978
Ke-Kevin, you still there?

25:46.012 --> 25:48.114
There's been an
explosion down there.
What?

25:48.147 --> 25:49.281
Kevin, are you okay?!

25:49.315 --> 25:50.583
Guys, what happened?!

25:50.617 --> 25:52.619
Is my brother alive?
Kevin!

25:52.652 --> 25:54.053
Just come with me.
Please, come with me.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.000
NELL:
Okay.

26:08.034 --> 26:10.202
So we just got access to
Holmes's teaching records.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.338
It turns out 72 officers

26:12.371 --> 26:14.841
were enrolled
in military ROTC programs

26:14.874 --> 26:17.977
at the universities where Holmes
taught and took his surveys.

26:18.010 --> 26:20.312
Of the 72, 17 of the students

26:20.346 --> 26:22.782
identified themselves
as "far right," politically.

26:22.815 --> 26:25.384
How did they manage to position
themselves into the same base?

26:25.417 --> 26:26.986
NELL: Well, people
don't join the Air Force

26:27.019 --> 26:27.954
to sit 60 feet
underground

26:27.987 --> 26:30.089
for days on end, doing nothing.

26:30.122 --> 26:31.624
They join to be a pilot.

26:31.658 --> 26:32.792
ERIC:
Exactly.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.093
If you volunteer for the job
of launch control officer,

26:34.126 --> 26:35.261
you're going to get it.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.263
And then you would get
to pick your base.

26:37.296 --> 26:38.831
All right, send these names
to the Pentagon.

26:38.865 --> 26:40.399
Pull these officers
off active duty.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.368
Their security clearance
needs to be revoked

26:42.401 --> 26:43.903
until they've been
fully investigated.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.204
But Holmes isn't the handler.

26:45.237 --> 26:46.372
He's just fishing.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.808
I mean, after they identify
the right-wing candidates,

26:48.841 --> 26:50.643
he has to be passing them off
to someone.

26:50.677 --> 26:52.779
Then let's find the handler.

26:52.812 --> 26:54.814
(indistinct radio chatter)

26:54.847 --> 26:56.182
(exhales)
What happened?

26:56.215 --> 26:58.685
They must have put an explosive
in the escape tunnel.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.820
SWAT was excavating the last
few feet when it was detonated.

27:00.853 --> 27:03.089
So Ross and Miller
are still alive?
Yes.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.757
Okay, where's...
so where's Tiffany?

27:04.791 --> 27:07.059
She's in there, but she's
not doing well, man.

27:07.093 --> 27:08.360
Yeah, well, her brother
seems to listen to her.

27:08.394 --> 27:09.361
You want to try and talk to her,

27:09.395 --> 27:11.297
see if you can get him and her
talking again?

27:11.330 --> 27:13.766
You got a Plan B?
The tunnel collapsed.

27:13.800 --> 27:14.967
We're excavating it
again now, but...

27:15.001 --> 27:16.736
but that's going
to take some time.

27:16.769 --> 27:18.805
Okay, what about communication
with other family members?

27:18.838 --> 27:19.972
You know, out of
all three officers,

27:20.006 --> 27:21.808
she's the only family member
that got any of them talking.

27:21.841 --> 27:22.842
All right. All right.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.911
I... I will talk
to her outside.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.713
Alone.
Okay.

27:29.015 --> 27:31.017
(indistinct conversations)

27:32.785 --> 27:34.754
Hey.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.255
Thanks, Josh.

27:36.288 --> 27:37.724
Kevin's alive.

27:37.757 --> 27:38.958
(gasping)

27:38.991 --> 27:41.193
All right.
Look at me.

27:41.227 --> 27:42.829
If we're gonna
keep him that way,

27:42.862 --> 27:44.430
you have to talk to him.

27:44.463 --> 27:48.467
You gotta get him to
see the bigger picture.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.838
You gotta get him to connect
to his humanity, okay?

27:51.871 --> 27:54.206
You have to remind him of
the guy he was growing up.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.008
I can't...
I can't hear him die.

27:56.042 --> 27:57.343
You're not gonna
hear him die.

27:57.376 --> 27:58.978
We're gonna get him
out of there peacefully.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.046
You hear me?

28:00.079 --> 28:02.248
You can do this.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.250
You talk to him.

28:04.283 --> 28:05.718
Okay?

28:05.752 --> 28:06.853
Come on.

28:07.887 --> 28:10.389
Okay. (sniffles)

28:10.422 --> 28:12.859
MOSLEY:
So the Pentagon has the name
of all of these officers?

28:12.892 --> 28:14.961
They've already been pulled off
duty and taken into custody.

28:14.994 --> 28:16.963
Great. Let me know
if you find the handler.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.798
If even one of those
missiles are launched,

28:18.831 --> 28:20.800
it could start a worldwide
nuclear holocaust.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.735
The missiles are never leaving
their tubes.

28:22.769 --> 28:25.171
The Air Force has already
positioned large trucks

28:25.204 --> 28:26.405
over the silo covers.

28:26.438 --> 28:28.808
If the covers
are opened to launch,

28:28.841 --> 28:30.810
the trucks fall
on the missiles.

28:30.843 --> 28:32.344
Won't that detonate
the warheads?

28:32.378 --> 28:35.314
No... but the fuel

28:35.347 --> 28:36.415
can cause
an explosion

28:36.448 --> 28:37.817
and disseminate the plutonium

28:37.850 --> 28:39.285
over a huge area.

28:39.318 --> 28:41.120
That's 50 giant dirty bombs.

28:41.153 --> 28:42.354
Wait, hold on a second.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.455
Kensi's sitting right on top
of this thing.

28:43.489 --> 28:45.491
I mean, h-how big of an area
are we talking about?

28:50.229 --> 28:52.431
Really? Nob-Nobody wants
to answer that question?

28:52.464 --> 28:56.903
Depends on the amount of fuel,
wind patterns...

28:56.936 --> 28:58.470
Give me a number.

28:58.504 --> 29:00.873
SAM: Three to five mile
lethal radius...

29:00.907 --> 29:02.241
per missile.

29:03.910 --> 29:06.045
Have you been able
to get a call in to her?

29:06.078 --> 29:07.780
No.

29:07.814 --> 29:09.548
FBI could be jamming
the cell towers in the area.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.151
I need you to get ahold of her.

29:12.184 --> 29:13.953
If she's speaking
to the officers

29:13.986 --> 29:16.889
in the launch control center...

29:16.923 --> 29:18.858
as long as
we're able to avert...

29:18.891 --> 29:19.959
She's never gonna leave,
you know that.

29:19.992 --> 29:21.994
I don't care. All right,
here's what you need to do.

29:22.028 --> 29:23.996
You need to get on the phone and
call whoever you need to call

29:24.030 --> 29:25.832
to get her out of there, 'cause
she doesn't have to do this.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.099
Somebody else can do this.

29:27.133 --> 29:29.168
I will do my best.

29:29.201 --> 29:31.203
What does
that mean?

29:32.604 --> 29:34.073
Not much.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.042
I'm sorry.

29:36.075 --> 29:37.043
You've gotta be kidding me.

29:39.311 --> 29:41.814
What I can do, going through
official channels,

29:41.848 --> 29:44.350
is far less effective than
what you can do with your voice.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.218
Just... keep
calling her.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.458
Walk with me.
What's going on now?

29:52.491 --> 29:53.926
I want to show you something.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.394
I've had several
conversations about you.

29:55.427 --> 29:56.929
Your record is exemplary.

29:56.963 --> 29:57.964
Conversations with who?

29:57.997 --> 29:59.098
People who matter.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.968
People who understand
what you and your team do.
Oh.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.903
Are you claustrophobic?

30:03.936 --> 30:04.736
Excuse me?

30:04.770 --> 30:06.572
Are you claustrophobic,
Agent Blye?

30:06.605 --> 30:08.941
I mean, a little, but I
can fight through it. Why?

30:08.975 --> 30:10.977
From what I hear,
you can fight through anything.

30:15.948 --> 30:16.983
Laptop.

30:18.284 --> 30:20.019
This is the Tango 1
escape tunnel.

30:20.052 --> 30:22.521
The tunnel collapsed
from the explosion.

30:22.554 --> 30:24.857
They cleaned it out, but now
they're reinforcing it,

30:24.891 --> 30:26.358
by putting a pipe
within the pipe,

30:26.392 --> 30:28.594
which, as you can see,
the diameter of the tunnel

30:28.627 --> 30:30.129
has gotten quite a bit smaller.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.597
KENSI:
How big is it now?

30:31.630 --> 30:33.132
18 inches.

30:34.901 --> 30:36.268
You want me to go down there.

30:36.302 --> 30:38.270
Yeah.

30:38.304 --> 30:41.173
You're the most
likely to fit.

30:41.207 --> 30:42.441
Plus, you have the highest level

30:42.474 --> 30:45.011
of tactical training
and experience.

30:48.047 --> 30:50.416
So you blow the hatch,
I go down...

30:50.449 --> 30:52.284
Yeah, we need at least
one of those officers

30:52.318 --> 30:53.953
taken out to stop the launch.

30:53.986 --> 30:56.956
What about the Romeo 1 LCC?

30:56.989 --> 30:59.225
We take out Zindower, and Miller
and Ross can't launch.

30:59.258 --> 31:01.894
Zindower also detonated
an explosive in that elevator.

31:01.928 --> 31:03.930
The damage there
was worse than this one.

31:03.963 --> 31:05.664
It'd take us hours
to excavate.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.566
Plus, the hallways of both LCCs

31:07.599 --> 31:10.002
are armed with explosives
and motion sensors.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.137
Even if we got through that,

31:11.170 --> 31:12.538
we have to get through
the blast door.

31:12.571 --> 31:14.941
That would take 12 hours,
at best.

31:17.409 --> 31:19.912
Okay.
Agent Blye...

31:19.946 --> 31:21.247
you sure?

31:21.280 --> 31:24.050
You understand how
dangerous this is?

31:25.417 --> 31:26.919
I understand.

31:27.954 --> 31:28.988
All right.

31:29.021 --> 31:29.989
Let's get this tunnel
reinforced

31:30.022 --> 31:31.223
as quickly as possible.

31:31.257 --> 31:32.291
All right?
Yes, sir.

31:32.324 --> 31:33.325
Let's go.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.497
What do we got?

31:38.530 --> 31:40.566
NELL: Okay. We've discovered
that this man, Curtis Denard,

31:40.599 --> 31:42.634
has made several trips
to Colorado.

31:42.668 --> 31:45.071
Additionally, we've discovered
footage of him

31:45.104 --> 31:47.940
meeting with Ross, Miller and
Zindower at a hotel in Denver.

31:47.974 --> 31:48.707
Who is he?

31:48.740 --> 31:50.309
He's an NSA analyst.

31:50.342 --> 31:51.710
The NSA has the nuclear codes.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.445
He may also have been
the source of the leak.

31:53.479 --> 31:54.446
Do you have an address?

31:54.480 --> 31:55.314
On your phones.

31:55.347 --> 31:56.949
Send it to LAPD SWAT.

31:56.983 --> 31:57.849
We'll meet 'em there.
Let's go.

31:57.883 --> 32:00.019
You been able to get
ahold of Kensi yet?

32:00.052 --> 32:01.587
No.
Stay here.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.622
Keep trying.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.657
(line ringing)

32:22.441 --> 32:24.210
We have anything?

32:24.243 --> 32:25.744
Well, I think they disconnected
the speakers.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.346
They're not picking up
the landline.

32:27.379 --> 32:28.680
You okay?

32:28.714 --> 32:29.548
No.

32:29.581 --> 32:31.717
AGENT: Okay. We're
getting something.

32:31.750 --> 32:34.420
It's from
Miller's terminal.

32:34.453 --> 32:37.056
KENSI:
"Is anybody reading this?"
MONROE: Why is he typing?

32:37.089 --> 32:39.591
Maybe he doesn't want Ross to
see what he's communicating.

32:44.596 --> 32:47.566
MONROE: "I'm sorry. I wish
there was another way."

32:47.599 --> 32:49.235
He's showing remorse.
That's a good thing.

32:49.268 --> 32:51.237
Okay, tell him
that he can still just get up

32:51.270 --> 32:52.771
and he can walk away.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.274
Okay, tell him
he still doesn't have to do it.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.451
How many
have you retargeted?

33:05.484 --> 33:07.786
14. You?

33:07.819 --> 33:10.022
Seventeen.

33:12.124 --> 33:14.126
I think we should launch.

33:15.161 --> 33:16.695
Not yet.

33:16.728 --> 33:18.530
We're only gonna get
one shot at this.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.332
Let's... let's make it count.

33:22.568 --> 33:24.803
What's he saying?
He's not responding.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.139
Agent Monroe, we're ready.
All right.
Agent Blye, it's time. Let's go.

33:27.173 --> 33:29.575
TIFFANY:
Wait, time for what?

33:29.608 --> 33:30.709
I have to go.

33:30.742 --> 33:33.545
Please, please, he doesn't want
to do this. I know him.

33:33.579 --> 33:35.547
Promise me
you'll get him out of there.

33:35.581 --> 33:37.349
We're doing the best we can.

33:37.383 --> 33:39.485
KENSI:
Tiffany,

33:39.518 --> 33:41.487
if there's any way,
they will get him out alive.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.056
MONROE:
Let's go, let's go.

33:49.428 --> 33:50.729
The opening
is too small

33:50.762 --> 33:52.531
for much more than
a gun and a grenade.

33:52.564 --> 33:54.600
Even then, you'll have to
hold 'em in front of you

33:54.633 --> 33:55.801
when you get to
the last few feet.

33:55.834 --> 33:58.337
Hey, I got to make a call.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.606
Just be 30 seconds.
I promise I'm not...

34:00.639 --> 34:02.541
I won't talk
about any of this.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.576
All right.

34:07.113 --> 34:09.115
(indistinct chatter)

34:10.116 --> 34:12.118
(line ringing)

34:13.152 --> 34:14.486
(phone rings)
Kens.

34:14.520 --> 34:16.088
Kens.
Hi, baby.

34:16.122 --> 34:17.223
You need to get out of there,
all right?

34:17.256 --> 34:18.624
If-if the launch doors open...

34:18.657 --> 34:20.859
Hey, Deeks, can you just listen
to me for a second?
...get in a car

34:20.892 --> 34:22.194
and I need you to drive away

34:22.228 --> 34:23.862
as fast as you possibly can,
because...

34:23.895 --> 34:25.797
(stammers)
Deeks, stop. Stop, babe.

34:25.831 --> 34:28.834
Stop. For once in your life,
stop talking.

34:28.867 --> 34:30.769
(exhales)

34:30.802 --> 34:32.838
I know what's going on.

34:32.871 --> 34:35.707
Okay, so then-then just leave.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.443
I can't.

34:37.476 --> 34:38.610
What do you mean, you can't?

34:38.644 --> 34:40.212
I can stop this from happening.

34:40.246 --> 34:41.813
I can stop people
from getting hurt.

34:41.847 --> 34:43.282
I've got to do it, okay?

34:43.315 --> 34:45.551
Okay, yeah, you can stop this
from happening,

34:45.584 --> 34:47.553
but so can other people,
all right? So just let...

34:47.586 --> 34:48.720
I love you so much.

34:48.754 --> 34:49.788
Hold on. I love you, too.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.290
That's not the point.

34:51.323 --> 34:53.492
Stop for a second.
You don't have to do this.

34:53.525 --> 34:55.761
Let some...
And I love you to the end
of time and back.

34:55.794 --> 34:57.529
(sighs)

34:57.563 --> 34:59.265
Kensi? Kensi.

34:59.298 --> 35:00.632
Kensi!

35:01.600 --> 35:03.602
(grunts)

35:07.739 --> 35:09.241
(phone rings)

35:09.275 --> 35:11.277
(indistinct chatter continues)

35:13.812 --> 35:15.814
(exhales)

35:17.749 --> 35:19.851
We've rigged the door
with a directed explosive.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.187
It should be enough
to blow the hatch

35:21.220 --> 35:22.321
but not enough
to kill Miller and Ross.

35:22.354 --> 35:23.789
You got to get down there.
Thank you.

35:23.822 --> 35:26.325
Quickly, I know. And take
at least one of them out.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.160
It's gonna be too tight
for you to wear a vest.

35:28.194 --> 35:29.428
I understand.

35:29.461 --> 35:30.762
Okay, then.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.331
Let's get ready
to blow the hatch.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.302
*

35:42.841 --> 35:44.476
In position.

35:44.510 --> 35:45.477
CALLEN:
In position.

35:45.511 --> 35:46.878
On my call.

35:46.912 --> 35:48.880
One, two, three.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.449
Execute, execute.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.322
Move! Go, go!

36:09.601 --> 36:12.371
SAM: Curtis Denard,
federal agents!

36:12.404 --> 36:14.373
Put down your weapon and
put your hands on your head!

36:18.710 --> 36:19.911
(sizzling)

36:21.647 --> 36:22.414
(knocking)

36:24.816 --> 36:26.885
CALLEN:
Clear.

36:30.956 --> 36:33.259
You gentlemen
continue to impress.

36:38.964 --> 36:41.300
(indistinct radio transmission)

36:41.333 --> 36:43.802
Ready.
Ready. Three,

36:43.835 --> 36:45.904
two, one!
MAN: Fire in the hole.

36:49.608 --> 36:51.410
We have ignition.
Let's go, go, go!

36:51.443 --> 36:53.645
Blow that air down there!
Get the smoke out!

36:53.679 --> 36:55.714
(panting, grunting)

36:58.350 --> 37:00.352
(coughs)
(Miller groans)

37:01.353 --> 37:03.989
Get up.

37:04.022 --> 37:06.558
Get up! Send the launch command!

37:06.592 --> 37:09.728
(grunting)

37:18.069 --> 37:20.038
Get back in your chair. Now!

37:20.071 --> 37:23.275
(groans)
No.

37:24.943 --> 37:27.913
I said get up.

37:27.946 --> 37:30.982
Get in your chair
and send the launch command.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.819
(grunting)

37:33.852 --> 37:35.687
Get back in your chair!

37:39.057 --> 37:41.259
(gasping)

37:42.861 --> 37:44.296
(grunts)

37:46.097 --> 37:47.899
(grunts)

37:49.000 --> 37:51.670
(panting, grunting)

37:54.840 --> 37:57.309
(panting)

38:12.691 --> 38:14.693
(coughing)

38:20.532 --> 38:21.533
(panting)

38:34.746 --> 38:36.715
This is Special Agent
Kensi Blye.

38:36.748 --> 38:40.051
LCC is secured.

38:40.085 --> 38:42.053
Both targets
have been taken out.

38:42.087 --> 38:44.055
(panting)

38:44.089 --> 38:46.858
It's over.

38:46.892 --> 38:49.127
It's all... it's all over.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.664
Copy, Agent Blye. Good work.
We'll notify.

38:56.067 --> 38:57.403
(indistinct chatter)

38:57.436 --> 38:58.604
It was something
to behold.

38:58.637 --> 39:00.071
Excellent work,
Agent Blye.

39:00.105 --> 39:01.072
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you. Thanks.

39:01.106 --> 39:03.074
Great work. Yeah.
Thank you.

39:19.925 --> 39:21.927
(car door shuts)

39:23.194 --> 39:26.131
Lieutenant Zindower's
LCC was breached

39:26.164 --> 39:28.467
about an hour ago by FBI.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.135
Unfortunately, he was killed.

39:30.168 --> 39:32.170
Leaving us a dead end.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.440
MOSLEY:
What did we find?

39:34.473 --> 39:36.174
One of Denard's drives
was unrecoverable.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.108
After going through
the second drive,

39:37.142 --> 39:39.044
we found the code names
of six men inside

39:39.077 --> 39:40.779
the Patton Project
who had financed

39:40.812 --> 39:42.481
and planned the
whole operation.

39:42.514 --> 39:44.015
Well, do we know
who they are?

39:44.049 --> 39:45.484
Not yet.

39:45.517 --> 39:47.986
Find them.
Hunt them down.

39:48.019 --> 39:50.522
Kill 'em, if you have to.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.428
Have a good night.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.666
"Good work"
would have been nice.

40:00.699 --> 40:03.702
Excellent work, Agent Hidoko.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.804
Thank you, Agent Hanna.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.874
CALLEN: Kens.
Hey.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.609
Welcome back.
Thanks.

40:10.642 --> 40:11.977
Heard you had
a hell of a day.

40:12.010 --> 40:12.978
Yeah, it was.

40:13.011 --> 40:15.046
Um, have any of you seen Deeks?

40:15.080 --> 40:17.048
Uh, he went out for some air.
I think he's up on the roof.

40:17.082 --> 40:18.717
Thank you.

40:23.589 --> 40:25.557
(sighs)

40:25.591 --> 40:27.959
(siren wailing in distance)

40:34.099 --> 40:35.467
Hi.

40:35.501 --> 40:37.503
Hey.

40:39.938 --> 40:40.972
Well, it's official.

40:41.006 --> 40:43.041
I'm never gonna criticize
your grilled cheese again.

40:52.684 --> 40:55.754
That was the hardest
thing I ever had to do.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.156
What's that,
making the grilled cheese

40:58.189 --> 41:01.459
or singlehandedly saving the
world from nuclear holocaust?

41:02.293 --> 41:04.496
Making that call to you.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.498
* And I don't want
to lose you now *

41:06.532 --> 41:08.900
(sighs)
* Or ever

41:08.934 --> 41:10.201
Ugh.

41:10.235 --> 41:13.505
How long are we
gonna do this for?

41:14.305 --> 41:17.809
* Or ever

41:17.843 --> 41:20.011
* And there's a darkness...

41:20.045 --> 41:21.813
I mean, you're the one
that wanted to stay in,

41:21.847 --> 41:23.214
so why don't you tell me?

41:23.248 --> 41:25.751
I don't know.
(sighs) That's great.

41:25.784 --> 41:29.254
I don't... I don't...
I don't know.

41:29.287 --> 41:31.256
* 'Cause if you got
a broken wing *

41:31.289 --> 41:35.861
* That makes me want to help you
find a way to throw... *

41:35.894 --> 41:38.263
I can't go through
what Sam went through.

41:38.296 --> 41:40.198
* We can even sing songs

41:40.231 --> 41:41.633
I mean, honestly,
I don't even know

41:41.667 --> 41:43.669
how that guy gets up
in the morning.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.274
What are we doing?

41:49.307 --> 41:51.509
(exhales)

41:55.647 --> 41:57.883
You're everything for me.

41:57.916 --> 42:01.186
(voice breaking):
And, um...

42:01.219 --> 42:03.054
* 'Cause I don't want
to lose... *

42:03.088 --> 42:06.257
I hate feeling like this.

42:06.291 --> 42:08.326
Because you're my world.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.261
* No, I don't want
to lose you now *

42:10.295 --> 42:11.863
* I don't want to lose *

42:11.897 --> 42:15.133
* Or ever

42:15.166 --> 42:17.969
* Baby, I don't want
to lose you now... *

42:18.003 --> 42:19.270
You are mine.

42:19.304 --> 42:21.006
* Or ever

42:21.039 --> 42:22.273
* I don't want to lose *

42:22.307 --> 42:24.209
* No, I don't want
to lose you now *

42:24.242 --> 42:25.711
* I don't want to lose *

42:25.744 --> 42:28.847
* Or ever

42:28.880 --> 42:30.248
* Oh, no.

42:30.281 --> 42:32.217
KENSI:
You're my world.
