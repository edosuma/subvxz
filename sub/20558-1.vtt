02:03.742 --> 02:05.953
Okay. Lets go.

02:07.036 --> 02:09.372
Hey! Hey! Hey!

02:09.413 --> 02:12.792
Hey!

02:12.876 --> 02:15.003
Another ticket.

02:15.087 --> 02:17.506
Damn!

02:17.589 --> 02:20.592
Parking on the wrong side
of the street?

02:20.633 --> 02:22.844
This is a Ford Dyslexia!

02:25.347 --> 02:28.267
Its gonna be a great day today,
Jerry Lee. Come on.

02:31.145 --> 02:33.938
Man: Park it over there.

02:37.317 --> 02:39.486
Man:
What? What? What? Its bank day.

02:39.570 --> 02:42.156
All right, I know were here
to get some Kibble money.

02:42.197 --> 02:45.909
I'm gonna go to that ATM machine
and get some cash.

02:50.998 --> 02:55.211
Stay here and watch my car. I spent
a lot of money restoring this car.

02:55.294 --> 02:57.545
You protect my car.

02:57.629 --> 03:00.549
And don't change the music.

03:00.632 --> 03:03.385
Stay. Don't bite my...

03:07.223 --> 03:11.184
Watch for bad guys near my car.

03:16.357 --> 03:20.444
Woman: When's your car gettin done?
Man: Wednesday, I think.

03:20.528 --> 03:22.571
Woman: What a hassle.
Man: Yeah.

03:28.661 --> 03:31.122
"Checking, savings."
No savings, checking.

03:36.001 --> 03:38.420
"Smoker, nonsmoker?"
Nonsmoker.

03:38.504 --> 03:40.881
"Democrat, Republican?"
Democrat.

03:43.384 --> 03:45.553
Man:
Didn't I tell you to stay in the car?

03:45.595 --> 03:48.096
Get in the car. Good boy.

03:54.103 --> 03:58.775
Get down! Police! Get down!

04:00.692 --> 04:03.153
Get down! Police!

04:06.323 --> 04:08.534
Police! Down, get down!

04:08.576 --> 04:11.329
No, not here.
Not by my car! Oh, man.

04:14.164 --> 04:16.959
Guard: Code Red! Code Red!
We're under fire.

04:17.041 --> 04:18.918
Repeat, were pinned down
and under fire.

04:19.003 --> 04:21.798
Some partner you are.
Why didn't you warn me, at least?

04:25.759 --> 04:28.313
Guard: Is this guy after the money,
or is he just pissed at your car?

04:28.437 --> 04:30.014
Can you reload, please?
Thank you.

04:37.105 --> 04:39.106
My speaker!

04:42.443 --> 04:44.612
My stereo.

04:52.328 --> 04:54.664
Were gonna take this guy out.
You cover us,

04:54.747 --> 04:58.126
and don't be afraid
to use the gun!

05:03.006 --> 05:05.841
Come on, Jerry Lee!

05:05.883 --> 05:07.718
Hey, come on. Open up.

05:11.765 --> 05:14.684
Come on. Shut the door.

05:16.268 --> 05:19.522
Okay, so I forgot.
Its a bulletproof window.

05:19.564 --> 05:21.858
All right, you son of a bitch,
we both have armor now.

05:26.905 --> 05:30.032
We got him.

05:30.074 --> 05:32.177
No, no, not the running thing.
I hate the running thing.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.996
Lets go.

06:19.207 --> 06:21.543
Jerry Lee!

06:30.386 --> 06:32.303
Man: Jerry Lee!

06:41.855 --> 06:45.817
Come on. Jerry Lee, come on!

06:56.036 --> 06:58.121
Aah!

07:05.587 --> 07:07.673
Damn it!

07:12.761 --> 07:15.430
Hey!

07:15.514 --> 07:17.516
He's gone.

07:20.853 --> 07:24.189
Why didn't you jump? Come on.

07:24.272 --> 07:27.192
What do you mean?

07:27.276 --> 07:30.863
What, are you leavin
it all for me? Huh?

07:30.905 --> 07:34.534
Christ, what's with you lately?
What's with you?

07:34.574 --> 07:37.327
We almost had that guy.

07:37.369 --> 07:40.331
You know why cops have dogs?

07:40.372 --> 07:43.709
So they don't have to do this!
That's the deal.

07:43.751 --> 07:46.420
Management, labor.
Foreman, employee.

07:46.504 --> 07:49.631
Boss, secretary.
I walk, you run.

07:49.715 --> 07:53.677
I cuff'em, you catch 'em.
You get treats, I get a promotion.

07:55.429 --> 07:57.390
I can't breathe!

08:05.898 --> 08:09.068
My car! Jerry Lee,
look what he did to my car!

08:09.110 --> 08:11.237
Look what they did!

08:11.279 --> 08:13.572
I couldn't even sell it
to a cheese factory.

08:13.614 --> 08:15.950
Hey, Dooley! Check this out.

08:16.033 --> 08:18.202
Its a modified M-16.
A company called...

08:18.285 --> 08:20.246
Armaments 2000s
doin' the retrofit.

08:20.288 --> 08:22.290
Its supposed to be
for military use only.

08:22.331 --> 08:25.042
- Where did you hear that?
- I saw it in a gun magazine.

08:25.125 --> 08:27.044
- Did you pick that up on the street?
- Yeah.

08:27.127 --> 08:29.463
- Are you supposed to be messin' with evidence?
- No.

08:29.547 --> 08:32.967
Give me that.
Go get me some coffee.

08:33.009 --> 08:35.845
Well, Jerry Lee, so much
for the Brady Bill, huh?

08:35.929 --> 08:39.306
- Dooley? What are you doing here?
- Hi, Captain.

08:39.347 --> 08:41.851
What happened?

08:41.933 --> 08:45.271
Uh, well, there was a,
uh, equipment failure.

08:45.313 --> 08:49.234
- Equipment failure?
- The bad guy had Air Jordan's on. It was no contest.

08:49.317 --> 08:53.529
What about Jerry Lee?
He needs four little Air Jordan's too?

08:53.612 --> 08:57.367
- You mean they make those for dogs?
- That was a rhetorical question.

08:57.450 --> 09:00.262
You know, Captain, you should let people
know when you plan to be rhetorical,

09:00.286 --> 09:02.205
cause your tone of voice
never changes.

09:02.289 --> 09:04.415
- You think you're funny?
- Sometimes.

09:04.498 --> 09:08.503
- This isn't one of those times.
- Jerry Lee, he just hit me!

09:08.544 --> 09:11.130
Quit bein' a smart-ass. Tell me what happened.
- Again!

09:12.549 --> 09:14.926
The bad guy had
a full body armor on.

09:15.010 --> 09:17.879
- That should have given you the advantage.
- It was that lightweight stuff.

09:18.003 --> 09:20.348
What can I tell you?
The guy had a rocket up his ass.

09:20.390 --> 09:22.475
- What the hell is that?
- This here?

09:22.517 --> 09:25.770
Uh, this was the shooters.
This is a modified M-16.

09:25.854 --> 09:28.305
A company named Armaments 2000
does the retrofit.

09:28.389 --> 09:30.107
Its apparently
for military use only.

09:30.191 --> 09:33.945
- How do you know all that?
- I'm trying to better myself by taking night seminars.

09:34.028 --> 09:37.365
Ah, shut up, will you?
You better sit down. You look pale.

09:37.407 --> 09:40.327
- Probably because you hit me.
- And give that dog there a drink of water.

09:40.369 --> 09:42.578
Jerry Lee is fine, and so am I.

09:42.662 --> 09:45.582
You don't look fine.
Sit down before you fall down.

09:46.708 --> 09:50.545
- Now. Detective Harris?
- Yes.

09:50.629 --> 09:55.216
- Its the smog!
- Take this to the lab and check it for prints, okay?

09:55.258 --> 09:58.136
You know, Dooley,

09:58.219 --> 10:01.214
every time you go someplace lately,
people try to kill you.

10:01.256 --> 10:03.475
- Well, I'm a popular guy.
- Look, I'm serious here.

10:03.558 --> 10:06.728
You've lost three suspects in three weeks!
Come.

10:06.769 --> 10:09.506
- You are either out of your league...
- I am not out of my league.

10:09.530 --> 10:12.400
- Or you've lost a step.
- What are you talking about, "lost a step"?

10:12.442 --> 10:15.612
You should have taken
time off after Tracy died.

10:15.696 --> 10:20.450
- That has nothing to do with it, Captain.
- Oh. Are you sure?

10:20.533 --> 10:23.745
Absolutely sure.

10:26.331 --> 10:28.709
When was the last time
you had a physical?

10:28.792 --> 10:31.336
Physical. Is that the blood pressure,
when they do the...

10:33.630 --> 10:37.259
I want you both checked out.
You understand me?

10:37.300 --> 10:40.804
I obviously can't
count on you anymore.

10:44.474 --> 10:46.810
Hey! What about my car?

10:46.893 --> 10:50.397
Have your detailer look at it.
He can probably rub it out.

10:50.480 --> 10:53.358
Rub it out?

10:53.442 --> 10:55.736
I guess I can drive it at night.
Nobody'll see it.

10:55.820 --> 10:59.990
Come on, Jerry Lee.
Come on, get in.

11:00.031 --> 11:01.992
My poor car.

11:02.034 --> 11:04.661
Aw, he got my cup holder too.

11:31.647 --> 11:33.566
Woman: I'm so sorry we're late.

11:33.649 --> 11:36.669
Man: Its okay, I haven't been waiting long,
and thank you very much for meeting me.

11:36.693 --> 11:39.113
Dooley:
Ah, you know what? Its my fault.

11:39.196 --> 11:41.258
Woman: Devon Lane, this is
my husband, Detective Dooley.

11:41.282 --> 11:43.427
Dooley: Nice to meet you.
Devon: Oh, the pleasure is all mine.

11:43.451 --> 11:45.929
Devon: I'm so excited.
Dooley: Can we get some drinks over here?

11:45.953 --> 11:48.705
- "Devon, you want a beer?
- Its Devon.

11:48.789 --> 11:52.293
Dooley: Devon. Sorry.
What's with the tape recorder?

11:52.376 --> 11:53.873
Devon: I'm a writer. I tape everything.

11:53.945 --> 11:57.215
Tracy: Devon, I just want to say that
I see real potential in your work.

11:57.256 --> 11:59.883
Devon: Potential? Really?
Tracy: Oh, yeah.

11:59.925 --> 12:03.846
He's been a cop a long time. Maybe he
can help you with some of that cop stuff.

12:03.887 --> 12:06.682
Devon: Would you?
Dooley: Well, yeah, sure. You okay, honey?

12:06.766 --> 12:09.036
Tracy: Ill be fine. I'll be
back in a few minutes. Excuse me.

12:09.060 --> 12:10.978
Devon:
Tracy told me you read my manuscript.

12:11.062 --> 12:13.905
Dooley: Yeah, I did.
I didn't read the whole thing.

12:13.989 --> 12:15.607
I read the first
and the last chapter.

12:15.691 --> 12:17.610
That's really
all I had time for.

12:17.693 --> 12:19.922
Devon: The first and last chapters?
Dooley: I gotta tell ya,

12:19.946 --> 12:22.865
uh, its-
it wasn't really that real.

12:22.949 --> 12:26.827
Devon: It wasn't real?
Dooley: No, it wasn't
real. I didn't believe a lot of the...

12:26.910 --> 12:30.623
all that cop stuff you have in there,
the shootouts and the bank robbery.

12:30.665 --> 12:32.917
That's not really
how it happens.

12:32.959 --> 12:35.855
Devon: It wasn't real?
Dooley: That's all right.
It's your first attempt, man.

12:35.879 --> 12:38.178
Don't worry about it.
You'll get there.

12:39.048 --> 12:42.176
Woman: Any loss of appetite?
No, I'm eating pretty well.

12:42.259 --> 12:45.888
- Not you, the dog.
- Oh, uh-

12:45.972 --> 12:48.016
No, he's fine.

12:48.099 --> 12:53.020
- Okay, I'm gonna increase the speed and incline.
- Why?

12:53.104 --> 12:55.982
Well, that's the standard
test for canines, Detective.

12:56.065 --> 12:58.192
Oh.

12:58.276 --> 13:00.820
What?

13:00.862 --> 13:03.197
I can hold the handrail.
Humans can hold the handrail.

13:05.366 --> 13:07.618
All right, all right, all right.

13:13.833 --> 13:16.001
Have you noticed
any changes in him?

13:16.043 --> 13:19.672
Yeah, he doesn't chase the little chuck
wagon across the kitchen floor anymore.

13:19.755 --> 13:22.383
Any loss of hearing or smell?

13:22.467 --> 13:24.979
Well, that depends on
what you mean by "any."

13:25.971 --> 13:28.264
Well, maybe sometimes,
a little bit.

13:28.347 --> 13:30.892
- Well, there's nothing wrong with your dog.
- Really?

13:30.975 --> 13:33.186
He's just suffering
from the effects of aging.

13:33.227 --> 13:35.814
- You should slow him down a bit.
- Why?

13:35.855 --> 13:38.358
Would you send your grandfather out
to try and do your job?

13:38.441 --> 13:41.861
I wouldn't send my grandfather
to microwave popcorn.

13:41.903 --> 13:45.156
- So why would you send out Jerry Lee?
- Cause my grandfather's too old.

13:45.198 --> 13:48.535
- So is Jerry Lee.
- What do you mean? Look at him.
He looks great.

13:48.618 --> 13:52.205
Do you know that dogs are leading
longer and healthier lives these days?

13:52.289 --> 13:55.375
- Where did you hear that?
- Seminar. At night. I try to better myself.

13:55.416 --> 13:58.211
Oh, you're trying to better yourself?
Maybe you should get a checkup.

13:58.253 --> 14:00.755
You've got high blood pressure.
Your face is bright red.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.842
That is a drinking problem!

14:03.884 --> 14:06.052
Well, what do you know?
You're a vet.

14:06.093 --> 14:08.596
You both need to be
on special diets.

14:08.721 --> 14:12.642
- The same one?
- No. You should be on a low-fat, low-sodium diet.

14:12.726 --> 14:15.103
The dog needs to be on
a senior maintenance meal plan.

14:15.987 --> 14:17.856
What the hells that?

14:17.898 --> 14:20.108
Lamb and rice for older dogs.

14:20.149 --> 14:23.737
It might give him some flatulence for a
week or so, but nothing to worry about.

14:23.778 --> 14:26.865
Nothing for you to worry
about. I gotta live with the damn dog.

14:26.948 --> 14:29.201
- You trying to be funny?
- No.

14:32.453 --> 14:34.372
I forgot my wallet,
so can I write a check?

14:36.499 --> 14:38.752
Do I get any free samples?

14:41.345 --> 14:43.466
Senior maintenance.

14:44.257 --> 14:46.676
Hey, your day.
You checked out great.

14:47.969 --> 14:50.430
You just, uh-

14:50.472 --> 14:52.432
You're out of shape.

15:11.910 --> 15:15.080
Come on. Lets go.

15:30.679 --> 15:32.348
Come on. Lets jump.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.883
Come on!

16:07.925 --> 16:10.261
Hey, hey.
Come here, you. Come on.

16:12.387 --> 16:14.598
Come on, just do it.

16:19.478 --> 16:22.440
Ow! Ow!

16:45.963 --> 16:48.007
Come on!

16:53.179 --> 16:54.847
Jump, jump, jump!

17:06.067 --> 17:08.653
Hey!
What are you doing on my spot?

17:11.948 --> 17:14.534
That's my spot.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.702
Here.

17:18.996 --> 17:22.165
That'll make you feel better.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.377
You all right?

17:24.461 --> 17:26.922
What's the matter
with your lamb and rice?

17:27.005 --> 17:29.006
You don't like it? Here.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.385
Huh? Here.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.724
How's that? Nothing, huh?

17:37.807 --> 17:39.893
But this is good for us.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.894
Think we should
work out every day.

17:41.978 --> 17:44.085
Very tribal.

17:44.647 --> 17:49.069
Yeah, some insurance company you are. I called
the office three hours ago about my car...

17:49.152 --> 17:51.655
Hey! Jeez!

17:51.738 --> 17:56.284
Jerry Lee! Come here.
Lie down. Down.

17:58.870 --> 18:01.248
Man:
I just saved you 300 calories.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.753
- Who is this?
- You should be drinking light beer.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.080
Less filling,
and it won't slow you down.

18:09.122 --> 18:12.250
And Dooley, you better pay attention
to the "won't slow you down" part.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.994
I could have beat you
running backwards, old man.

18:15.178 --> 18:19.015
- What do you want?
- Don't tell me you haven't figured it out yet, Detective.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.893
Three times
in three weeks, Dooley.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.813
I could have taken you out
anytime I wanted.

18:24.896 --> 18:29.109
I want you to know how it feels to have
someone else control your destiny.

18:29.151 --> 18:33.404
- Jerry, down!
- How it feels to have someone else destroy your life.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.116
- What do you want?
- It's hard to lose a loved one.

18:36.199 --> 18:38.861
Isn't it, Dooley? But then,
sometimes life just has a way...

18:38.886 --> 18:41.497
of kicking you in the face,
just when you think you've got it made.

18:41.581 --> 18:43.998
Hey, why don't you come in.

18:44.082 --> 18:47.002
You and I, we can have
a beer, we can chat.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.004
And then I'll bust your ass.

18:49.087 --> 18:53.467
You're in no position, literally,
to start playin' bad guy, Dooley.

20:02.202 --> 20:05.039
Dooley: ... about my car. Hey! Jeez!

20:05.080 --> 20:10.837
Jerry Lee! Come here. - "Chapter
Six. Spoon-fed information by our hero",

20:10.920 --> 20:15.674
Detective Dooley finally
figures out he is the target.

20:15.758 --> 20:18.302
But he still has no idea why.

20:18.385 --> 20:23.057
- Who is this?
- Life is about to get a little more real.

20:27.561 --> 20:31.440
Man On Tape: I could have beat
you running backwards, old man.

20:31.524 --> 20:34.193
Don't tell me you haven't
figured it out yet, Detective.

20:34.277 --> 20:36.945
Three times
in three weeks, Dooley.

20:37.029 --> 20:39.949
I could have taken you out
anytime I wanted.

20:45.413 --> 20:48.208
Dooley: Well, at least we
know now were being set up.

20:48.291 --> 20:50.209
Now, if we could just keep
Byers off our back.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.711
You let me do the talkin, huh?

20:54.004 --> 20:56.465
Oh, am I sore.

20:59.636 --> 21:03.180
Okay.

21:05.766 --> 21:07.935
Dooley: How are you
feelin'? Come here.

21:07.977 --> 21:11.264
Come on. Stay with me.
You know what, Jerry Lee?

21:11.347 --> 21:13.449
That vet was wrong.
Were not getting old.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.901
Were getting sexier
and better and wiser.

21:27.997 --> 21:29.999
Man: Everybody duck. Its Dooley.

21:30.082 --> 21:32.251
Don't listen to him.

21:32.335 --> 21:36.005
Lay down, Jerry Lee.

21:36.089 --> 21:39.342
What's with him?

21:39.426 --> 21:43.846
What? He's not a morning dog.

21:43.930 --> 21:46.075
Listen, last night the shooter called.
Took a shot at me.

21:46.099 --> 21:48.059
- Hit my beer.
- Why didn't you call it in?

21:48.184 --> 21:51.563
I got another beer. But wait a minute,
he said something weird.

21:51.646 --> 21:56.943
Something really strange. He said, "Its
hard to lose a loved one, isn't it?"

21:57.026 --> 22:01.197
- Is he talkin about Tracy?
- I don't know.

22:01.239 --> 22:04.534
Could be anything. Could be a revenge
act, it could be somebody I know.

22:04.576 --> 22:08.287
- I-I-I don't know.
- Harry Stipe. Harry Stipe.

22:08.371 --> 22:10.891
He swore that he would get you
after what happened to his brother!

22:10.915 --> 22:14.085
- No, Harry Stipes doin' five to ten.
- Not anymore. He got paroled.

22:14.169 --> 22:16.088
- Harry Stipe is out?
- Yeah, it just came in.

22:16.171 --> 22:19.257
- Stipe is out, and nobody told me?
- Just came across my desk.

22:19.340 --> 22:22.153
- Give me the parole officers name. I want his address.
- Not so fast, Dooley.

22:22.177 --> 22:24.596
- Come on! Give it to me.
- Sit.

22:26.807 --> 22:31.728
There's some guy out there gunnin' for you.
You're not going anywhere alone anymore.

22:31.769 --> 22:34.981
- Not this again.
- Welles, get in here.

22:35.065 --> 22:38.610
- Welles?
- And bring Zeus with you!

22:38.693 --> 22:41.405
Zeus?

22:41.446 --> 22:45.450
Hey, whoa-ho-ho!

22:49.830 --> 22:51.790
Meet your new partners.

22:53.041 --> 22:55.002
No way!

22:55.127 --> 22:57.967
- You're not gonna actually let them in here, are you?
- I certainly am.

23:02.634 --> 23:04.761
- Detective Dooley.
- Officer Welles.

23:04.803 --> 23:08.473
- Sergeant Welles now.
- Oh. Sorry, I didn't know.

23:08.556 --> 23:11.244
- Good, you two know each other.
- Yeah, we had a moment a little while ago.

23:11.268 --> 23:12.909
Before he, uh.

23:14.154 --> 23:17.191
Look, I don't see what that dog
has gotta do that Jerry Lee can't do.

23:19.068 --> 23:22.028
Zeus!

23:27.201 --> 23:29.495
Very impressive, Welles.

23:29.578 --> 23:32.498
- Dooley?
- What?

23:32.540 --> 23:35.834
He was trained
in anti-terrorist tactics.

23:35.917 --> 23:38.629
Could he go into a mini-mart
and pick up a six-pack of beer?

23:38.670 --> 23:41.131
He attacks through windows.

23:41.173 --> 23:44.593
Well, Jerry Lee
has mastered Windows 98.

23:44.677 --> 23:47.888
Got his own chat room.
"Dogs for Dogs"?

23:57.481 --> 23:59.941
Jerry Lee can do that.

24:00.025 --> 24:02.402
You can do that, can't you?

24:04.572 --> 24:07.541
Captain? I really don't
think this is a good idea.

24:07.583 --> 24:10.444
- I couldn't agree more with her.
- Dooley shouldn't even have that dog.

24:10.569 --> 24:13.347
He's not trained as a canine officer.
He's a dog with a pet.

24:14.130 --> 24:16.500
Ooh! Aren't we a little moody?

24:16.583 --> 24:20.129
Zeus and I can handle this case alone.

24:20.212 --> 24:23.757
I got news for you. Once I get a
parolees address, this case is closed.

24:23.799 --> 24:26.927
Then I got news for you.
A parolee doesn't even fit the profile.

24:27.010 --> 24:29.179
Profile? What is this,
an Olympic moment?

24:29.263 --> 24:32.808
- This is a police investigation here.
- Really? I wouldn't have guessed.

24:32.892 --> 24:35.386
You don't need a profile
to catch a bad guy.

24:35.469 --> 24:37.729
All you need is a good cop
with good instincts.

24:37.771 --> 24:41.066
I'm glad you said "good cop,"
because so far, your instincts suck!

24:41.108 --> 24:45.071
You two are gonna
get along great.

24:45.112 --> 24:47.407
Dooley, I need to talk to you alone.
No offense, Sergeant.

24:47.448 --> 24:49.700
No offense taken, Captain.

24:49.783 --> 24:53.037
See you outside, partner.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.456
Hey! If you're
gonna ride with me,

24:55.498 --> 24:58.376
get out of that uniform and
be on my desk in five minutes.

24:59.961 --> 25:01.879
- "At. " He meant "at."
- No, I meant "at."

25:01.962 --> 25:04.381
"At." At my desk.

25:04.465 --> 25:06.634
"At."

25:08.803 --> 25:11.890
What is wrong with you? Didn't you go
to the sexual harassment seminar?

25:11.973 --> 25:14.683
I missed that one.
I was-I was at another seminar.

25:14.767 --> 25:17.853
All right, forget about it.
Shell probably be cool about it.

25:17.937 --> 25:20.973
- Ah, look. Put Jerry Lee outside.
- He can't testify.

25:21.015 --> 25:23.568
- Look, just have him wait outside.
- He can keep a secret!

25:23.651 --> 25:25.737
- Have him wait outside!
- All right. Come on, Jerry.

25:25.820 --> 25:30.324
Uh, I got a delivery
for, uh, Detective Dooley.

25:32.410 --> 25:35.121
Sign, please.

25:35.163 --> 25:38.708
- Uh, there's a complementary card in there.
- Thank you.

25:40.584 --> 25:44.464
I saw the vet report
today, and uh,

25:44.505 --> 25:46.883
you need to...

25:48.718 --> 25:51.429
Dooley: What?

25:53.306 --> 25:55.641
You better give some serious thought.

25:59.938 --> 26:03.975
- You need to give thought to getting a newer dog.
- What?

26:04.058 --> 26:05.276
- Well, one like Zeus. Yes.
- Zeus?

26:05.359 --> 26:07.403
That crazy, psycho dog?
Are you kiddin' me?

26:07.445 --> 26:10.198
He wouldn't last five minutes
with me, I'd kill him!

26:10.240 --> 26:12.283
Look, he probably
doesn't even drink.

26:12.367 --> 26:16.580
I don't need a new dog. You know what
I need is a bigger gun, one like this.

26:16.663 --> 26:19.290
- Will you put that away, you idiot?
- Or one like this.

26:19.373 --> 26:23.169
- Where did you get this? This is L.A., not Dallas.
- How about this one?

26:23.253 --> 26:27.174
Look, I got a guy out there
with an M-16 takin' shots at me,

26:27.257 --> 26:29.884
and all I got... is this.

26:29.926 --> 26:33.938
Dooley, firearms, that's not
the problem. The problem is Jerry Lee.

26:34.021 --> 26:36.391
- What?
- Well, if he misses a step, you could lose your life.

26:36.433 --> 26:39.170
Don't you understand? That's why
I'm giving you both new partners.

26:39.294 --> 26:41.188
I read that vet report.

26:41.271 --> 26:45.775
The vet report said you were in the best
shape you've ever been in your life.

26:45.859 --> 26:47.944
Alert. Responsive.

26:47.986 --> 26:49.946
He's a killer!

26:49.988 --> 26:52.449
You're a stud dog, Jerry Lee.

26:54.243 --> 26:57.120
See?

26:57.162 --> 27:00.473
You see that?
You see his sly and uncanny way?

27:00.556 --> 27:03.585
He's pretending to be
asleep so he can pounce.

27:03.627 --> 27:06.714
Good boy, Jerry Lee.
Come on. Lets go.

27:06.797 --> 27:09.632
Come! Jerry.

27:09.674 --> 27:12.969
Hot dogs! Hamburgers! Chili!

27:17.099 --> 27:21.060
Hey, Dooley. These flowers
were just delivered for you.

27:21.144 --> 27:23.146
Must have been a wild night.

27:23.188 --> 27:25.816
"Was last night as good for you
as it was for me?"

27:27.818 --> 27:31.071
- Who gave you these?
- The delivery guy.

27:31.155 --> 27:34.207
- What did he look like?
- Green pants, black belt.

27:34.290 --> 27:36.159
You saw him from
the waist down, that's it?

27:36.243 --> 27:38.221
- I was sittin' in...
- What are you doing?
Touching evidence again?

27:38.245 --> 27:40.664
Puttin' your prints
all over this? Listen to me.

27:40.748 --> 27:45.044
- You see these gloves?
- Yeah.
- I want you to wear these things. Forever!

27:45.127 --> 27:48.338
- Okay.
- Take these down to the lab
and have them dusted.

27:48.380 --> 27:50.716
Welles: Zeus! Come!
- Come on. Lets go.

27:59.691 --> 28:03.562
That Welles and that stupid psycho dog
is probably sittin up at the desk.

28:03.604 --> 28:05.564
You and I can go get
the bad guys ourselves.

28:05.606 --> 28:07.691
Hey!
We were just looking for you.

28:07.733 --> 28:09.694
- Weren't we, Jerry?
- Check this out.

28:09.735 --> 28:12.595
If you look at the holes,
they actually spell out something.

28:12.637 --> 28:14.573
It says, "Even though
I'm older and slower",

28:14.615 --> 28:17.076
I'm still the same asshole
as I was before."

28:17.117 --> 28:19.745
Very funny. That's very funny.
You think that was funny?

28:19.829 --> 28:22.248
- Come on, Jerry Lee.
- Zeus!

28:25.792 --> 28:27.753
I can do that.

28:30.256 --> 28:33.200
All right, look.
I want to get one thing straight...

28:33.283 --> 28:34.816
before we go on here, all right?

28:34.886 --> 28:38.430
What went on between
you and me is history.

28:38.472 --> 28:40.557
Now, you have got to let it go.

28:42.059 --> 28:43.978
I don't even think
about it anymore.

28:44.061 --> 28:46.063
And neither should you. Okay?

28:47.357 --> 28:50.684
- Okay.
- What do you mean, okay?

28:50.767 --> 28:52.719
- I mean okay.
- Okay, you agree with it,

28:52.803 --> 28:54.739
or okay, you don't
think about it anymore?

28:54.780 --> 28:57.050
- Okay. I don't think about it.
- How can you not think about it?

28:57.074 --> 28:59.303
- You said you don't think about it.
- Well, of course not.

28:59.327 --> 29:01.820
- I mean, I'm-I'm-I'm...
- But what? What?

29:01.862 --> 29:05.624
What? You're so irresistible,
how could I not think about it?

29:05.708 --> 29:09.787
- Well-
- Because, you know, it was one night.

29:09.929 --> 29:12.423
- Heat of the moment stuff.
- Absolutely right!

29:12.465 --> 29:14.967
- Right.
- Get in.

29:17.428 --> 29:20.431
- What was that?
- What? Nothing.

29:23.017 --> 29:27.146
And you, dog, lets get one thing
straight between you and me, all right?

29:27.229 --> 29:31.609
Number one: No barking,
no drooling, no f-

29:32.693 --> 29:34.320
passing of gas...

29:34.362 --> 29:38.249
or performing any bodily functions
in or about my car.

29:38.291 --> 29:41.035
Number two: You always
sit in the back seat.

29:41.118 --> 29:45.999
Number three:
Never give me any lip.

29:47.182 --> 29:49.878
That's negotiable. That's negotiable.

29:49.961 --> 29:54.590
Just relax.
Jerry Lee, watch him.

29:57.760 --> 30:02.515
Ticket! Look at that!

30:02.557 --> 30:04.642
I think she follows me around.

30:04.725 --> 30:07.061
Just put it in
the glove compartment.

30:07.145 --> 30:09.731
Dooley! How many
parking tickets do you have?

30:09.814 --> 30:12.676
- Put 'em in the glove compartment and shut it.
- Do you know how to park a car?

30:12.700 --> 30:14.361
Shut it!

30:21.576 --> 30:25.747
Ugh, I'm gonna need a tetanus shot
from just sitting in this car.

30:25.830 --> 30:27.790
Dooley: We're going to Harry Stripe's.

30:27.833 --> 30:30.793
Were going to arrest him, and you'll
never have to see me again, all right?

30:30.835 --> 30:33.755
Fine.

30:33.838 --> 30:37.341
Dooley: Your dog likes to look through windows?
- He attacks through windows.

30:37.425 --> 30:39.244
Dooley: Yeah, but can he sing?
Welles: What?

30:39.327 --> 30:41.680
- Jerry Lee can sing.
- Yeah, right.

30:44.766 --> 30:48.019
Hear that? Come on, Jerry Lee.

30:58.571 --> 31:00.758
Welles: I'm tellin' ya, he's
not the guy we're lookin' for.

31:00.782 --> 31:03.869
- And how would you know that?
- Because he doesn't fit the profile.

31:03.952 --> 31:06.705
Profile. Welles,

31:06.789 --> 31:08.957
this is a profile.

31:09.040 --> 31:12.836
A profile is only good when
you're trying to narrow down suspects.

31:12.919 --> 31:15.297
We need a list
of suspects first.

31:15.380 --> 31:18.884
- Its not him.
- Okay, then. Stay in the car.

31:21.261 --> 31:25.015
And you too. You stay.
Jerry Lee? Lets go.

31:25.098 --> 31:27.976
We are not staying in the car.

31:31.480 --> 31:33.815
- Don't look at me like that.
- Look at you like what?

31:33.857 --> 31:36.777
Not you. Him.

31:36.860 --> 31:39.071
I got a weapon. I'll use it.

31:39.154 --> 31:42.783
We are trained K-9 officers.
We don't do "stay in the car."

31:42.866 --> 31:44.785
Why don't you...

31:44.869 --> 31:48.955
and your little puppy
go in through the back?

31:49.039 --> 31:52.960
He's not a puppy. And why do we have
to go in the back? Why don't you?

31:53.043 --> 31:56.630
We don't do back doors. Come on!

32:08.225 --> 32:11.728
Wow. Look at this.

32:11.770 --> 32:14.815
You know, I hear they're
converting this to condos?

32:14.898 --> 32:16.817
If we take some out
of your money market fund,

32:16.900 --> 32:19.653
we can buy one of these
and use it as a rental.

32:19.737 --> 32:21.948
I hear conversions
can be a great investment.

32:22.031 --> 32:24.908
Condos and-Jesus!

32:26.243 --> 32:29.580
I mean, Jesus,
I'm glad you're here.

32:29.622 --> 32:31.582
Watch our backs, please.

32:31.624 --> 32:35.002
All right, Jerry Lee.
Time to go to work.

32:35.086 --> 32:37.004
Wait up. Come on.

32:43.302 --> 32:45.721
Jerry Lee. This is Harry Stipes.

32:45.763 --> 32:47.765
Remember? Come here.

32:48.599 --> 32:50.517
Sit down.

32:56.107 --> 32:59.986
Where is she now?
We should have went around back.

33:05.115 --> 33:07.201
What's the matter, Harry?
I hit ya?

33:07.284 --> 33:11.547
Harry: You son of a bitch!
You ruined my best pants, man!

33:11.589 --> 33:13.958
Ooh, you got
a potty-mouth there, buddy!

33:14.000 --> 33:15.459
You kiss your mom
with that mouth?

33:15.501 --> 33:17.962
Throw out the shotgun,
and any other weapons.

33:18.003 --> 33:20.089
And don't forget any.

33:20.131 --> 33:22.175
I got Jerry Lee here with me.

33:22.258 --> 33:24.719
You know what hell do if he
finds them!

33:24.803 --> 33:27.363
Hey, listen, man. You just keep
that dog away from me, all right?

33:29.140 --> 33:31.183
I don't want to deal
with Jerry Lee again, man.

33:31.267 --> 33:34.187
You know, last time we met,
it wasn't a good thing.

33:34.270 --> 33:36.397
Jesus, Harry.

33:36.481 --> 33:39.334
- What, are you planning to go back to night school?
- I need a little protection.

33:39.358 --> 33:42.278
- You know what I'm saying, man?
- Is that everything?

33:43.220 --> 33:44.864
Yeah.

33:44.947 --> 33:47.116
Okay, Jerry Lee.

33:47.200 --> 33:51.579
- Oh! Oh! Hey, man, you get that dog away from me, man.
- Back it up, Harry.

33:51.662 --> 33:55.666
Easy, Jerry Lee. Easy.
Check it out. Back up, Harry.

33:58.294 --> 34:00.880
Hold it right there. Stipe
Easy, doggie. Calm down.

34:00.964 --> 34:03.133
- Shh!
- So, where you been lately, Harry?

34:03.216 --> 34:05.444
- Shootin at armored cars?
Makin' midnight calls?
Welles: Zeus!

34:05.468 --> 34:07.553
- What?
- Step away from the window, Harry.

34:07.637 --> 34:09.855
- Huh?
- The window, Harry. Step away.

34:09.938 --> 34:11.474
All right, man.

34:19.649 --> 34:22.777
- So, where were you yesterday?
- What do you mean, man? I was right here.xxxx

34:22.860 --> 34:25.864
- Don't lie to me, Harry.
- I'm not lyin' to you, man.

34:25.906 --> 34:28.033
Look, you see this?
Its not a social beeper.

34:28.074 --> 34:30.493
Its a house arrest bracelet.
It's like a LoJack on my leg.

34:30.576 --> 34:32.578
It goes off, everybody's here.

34:32.661 --> 34:34.746
Cops, SWAT team,
my parole officer, everybody!

34:34.789 --> 34:37.208
All right, okay.
Let me see your parole papers.

34:37.250 --> 34:40.379
I'm really happy you're here, man,
I gotta tell you. And you too.

34:40.420 --> 34:42.463
They're out there
and they want to kill me.

34:42.547 --> 34:44.841
They want to kill me.
Here you go, give it to him.

34:44.924 --> 34:47.051
Ooh! Hey, easy.

34:47.092 --> 34:49.763
- Thank you, Jerry.
- Hey, man, you know what?

34:49.846 --> 34:53.667
- I want to thank you for putting my brother in.
- Where'd you get the gun Jerry?

34:53.750 --> 34:56.268
Oh! They were here when I moved in!

34:56.351 --> 34:59.206
Oh, really? I didn't see the sign
when I came in: "Free cable and ammo."

34:59.230 --> 35:02.317
- Oh, yeah. There's a sign.
- Jerry Lee?

35:03.694 --> 35:07.405
Fat Tommy, man.
Fat Tommy got 'em for me.

35:07.447 --> 35:09.592
- I thought you couldn't leave the place.
- He delivers.

35:09.616 --> 35:11.952
So, if he didn't make it
in 30 minutes, you get free ammo?

35:12.035 --> 35:14.246
Hey, you know,
I didn't think about that.

35:14.287 --> 35:17.249
- Fat Tommy get military weapons too?
- Oh, yeah. Military stuff.

35:17.291 --> 35:20.001
He's got everything, man.
He's got a big-time supplier.

35:20.084 --> 35:22.295
- Who?
- I don't know.

35:22.379 --> 35:24.923
- Police, freeze!
- Aah!

35:24.965 --> 35:28.176
I heard gunshots!
Wait. Where's my dog?

35:28.260 --> 35:32.388
Dog? What dog?

35:38.854 --> 35:43.484
Great instincts, Dooley.
So, what now, big guy?

35:43.525 --> 35:47.195
Dooley: You know, after battle,
dogs and men like a treat.

35:47.279 --> 35:49.281
Jerry Lee was good,
so he gets a treat!

35:52.284 --> 35:54.286
Where's he goin'?

35:54.370 --> 35:56.497
Uh, he knows its treat time.

36:08.259 --> 36:11.887
I can't believe you're going
to feed your dog this.

36:11.970 --> 36:13.889
Surest way to kill him
is with this garbage.

36:13.972 --> 36:15.950
He should be eating nothing
but senior maintenance.

36:15.974 --> 36:19.520
You know what? I tried that senior
maintenance. I liked it. I mean, with a beer.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.945
I don't have any money.
I forgot my wallet at the station.

36:28.028 --> 36:30.489
- You got $30 on you?
- Figures. Yes.

36:37.913 --> 36:41.125
- Hey! What's with your dog?
- What? He's fine.

36:41.208 --> 36:43.127
I don't think he likes me.

36:43.210 --> 36:46.130
- What? What's with this guy?
- He has to go to the rest room.

36:46.214 --> 36:49.258
- Oh. Oh, to be a dog.
- Excuse us.

36:53.053 --> 36:55.556
No, no. He wants some privacy.
Do you mind?

36:55.598 --> 36:58.976
- The dog?
- The dog.

36:59.060 --> 37:01.937
- Thank you.
- I like it myself sometimes.

37:02.020 --> 37:06.275
Excuse me? Excuse me.

37:06.317 --> 37:09.612
Have you seen a white poodle?

37:09.654 --> 37:11.614
- White?
- Mm-hmm.

37:11.656 --> 37:13.949
No. Mm-mm.

37:14.032 --> 37:17.119
Hurry up!

37:17.161 --> 37:20.122
Where's your dog?

37:20.206 --> 37:23.001
Jerry Lee? Jerry Lee!

37:23.084 --> 37:28.214
Hey, what language is it
that you speak to that dog?

37:28.297 --> 37:31.842
Dutch.
He was trained in the Netherlands.

37:31.926 --> 37:35.471
Oh, the Netherlands! Scuse me!

37:35.555 --> 37:37.474
Jerry Lee was trained in Oxnard.

37:38.807 --> 37:41.852
You know, the best K-9 dogs
come from Oxnard.

37:41.936 --> 37:44.355
I could learn so much
from you, Dooley.

37:44.397 --> 37:47.483
God, I hate it when people
don't pick up after their dogs!

37:47.525 --> 37:49.486
Breed their dogs in the park.

37:49.527 --> 37:52.447
They don't take care. They breed dogs in the
park. That's the worst thing in the world..

37:56.868 --> 38:00.288
Dooley! What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

38:00.371 --> 38:03.208
- Jesus, do you always throw women around the park?
- Stupid kid.

38:03.291 --> 38:07.295
Let go. Tell the mutt get off.

38:07.378 --> 38:10.340
Clog! Heineken! Heineken!
Oppenheimer. Dutch Schultz!

38:10.381 --> 38:14.302
- Come on, let go. Let go!
- Zeus!

38:14.386 --> 38:18.556
Moron.

38:21.142 --> 38:24.521
My shirt. He wrecked my shirt.

38:24.562 --> 38:26.064
Jerry Lee!

38:30.818 --> 38:33.696
Shit!

38:35.573 --> 38:39.202
Where have you been? What,
did you take her out to dinner too?

38:40.620 --> 38:42.997
Come on, I got your hot dog.

38:44.666 --> 38:48.086
You get lucky, I get shit.

38:48.169 --> 38:51.923
Come on. What took you so long?

38:52.007 --> 38:55.468
Dooley: Hey, Welles, give me a.
I thought he was gonna shoot ya.

38:55.551 --> 38:58.179
Welles What? A kid with a
toy gun was gonna shoot me?

39:03.518 --> 39:05.938
Checkmate.

39:16.657 --> 39:19.017
Welles: Why are we parking
all the way out here?

39:19.059 --> 39:21.452
I don't want anybody
bangin' my doors.

39:21.494 --> 39:24.539
Banging your doors?
Your doors are all shot up.

39:24.623 --> 39:27.834
- Don't be so negative.
- Oh, Zeus.

39:27.876 --> 39:32.630
- Come on.
- Hey, Jerry Lee. Come here.

39:32.672 --> 39:34.716
What is that smell?

39:34.799 --> 39:36.718
- Smell?
- Oh!

39:53.652 --> 39:55.779
Mikey. What's up, man?

39:57.530 --> 39:59.741
Excuse me.

39:59.825 --> 40:02.202
Hello!

40:02.244 --> 40:04.705
- You know where Fat Tommy is?
- Never heard of him.

40:04.747 --> 40:07.291
- Fat. Tommy. Big guy.
- Never heard of him!

40:07.374 --> 40:09.710
He's big. He's got a big belly.
Is he at brunch now?

40:09.752 --> 40:13.088
- Don't know who you're talking about.
- Buffet? Lunch? Dinner?

40:13.171 --> 40:16.258
- Nope.
- Come on, you must have seen
him walkin down the street.

40:16.341 --> 40:18.969
- With a light on him, he looked like a fire truck?
- Never.

40:19.053 --> 40:21.639
Jerry Lee, you hear that?
He never heard of Fat Tommy.

40:21.722 --> 40:23.640
Thanks, man. Nice haircut.

40:29.730 --> 40:32.066
What?

40:34.235 --> 40:37.821
I can do that.
Keep your elbows up.

40:37.905 --> 40:40.240
Little higher.
That's it, that's it. Yeah.

40:54.129 --> 40:56.215
Gonna get some tape.

40:56.257 --> 40:58.551
Gotta wrap the tape.

40:58.593 --> 41:01.386
All right, everybody. Listen up!

41:01.428 --> 41:04.056
Yo! Listen up!

41:04.098 --> 41:06.058
Yo! I'm talkin' to you, Rocky!

41:08.477 --> 41:10.438
I'm lookin' for the Fat Man.

41:10.480 --> 41:15.150
Oh, I didn't know this was "I'm not
talkin' to the cop" day. I understand.

41:16.610 --> 41:19.196
Hello!

41:19.280 --> 41:21.616
That's quite a command
you have there, Dooley.

41:21.657 --> 41:23.993
Well, smarty-pants,

41:24.077 --> 41:27.413
I thought maybe Id let you and the
psycho dog, you know, do a little work.

41:27.454 --> 41:31.459
I think we will.

41:31.500 --> 41:34.671
Zeus!

42:10.665 --> 42:12.959
Come on, lady, call your dog off!

42:15.295 --> 42:17.880
You know, your dog
has some real control issues.

42:17.922 --> 42:19.882
Think you should
work with him at it.

42:19.924 --> 42:21.884
You know.

42:24.220 --> 42:26.848
Man: Whose mutt is this?

42:28.058 --> 42:31.018
Okay. Now watch
some real police work.

42:31.060 --> 42:33.688
Man: Get this dog outta here!

42:33.730 --> 42:36.357
What the hell are you idiots
doin up there?

42:36.399 --> 42:38.693
Hey, Fat Tommy, how ya doin?

42:38.735 --> 42:41.029
Keep that dog away from me!

42:41.071 --> 42:44.281
Wow! Look at you!
You've lost a lot of weight.

42:44.365 --> 42:46.083
You're lookin' good, Fat Tommy!

42:46.167 --> 42:49.671
- What, did you have your stomach stapled?
- Keep that dog away from me.

42:49.712 --> 42:51.632
I'll sue you this time, I will.

42:51.715 --> 42:54.876
You might have to, unless you tell me
who's sellin' the M-16 retrofit.

42:54.909 --> 42:58.379
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I'm a legitimate businessman.

42:59.672 --> 43:02.759
Say hello to Jackie Hammer.
Maybe you heard of him.

43:02.843 --> 43:05.012
They call him "Fists of Steel."

43:05.095 --> 43:07.805
He's the super middleweight
kickboxing champion.

43:07.889 --> 43:10.183
He's the ultimate
fightin' champ.

43:11.434 --> 43:13.895
I don't get that
pay-per-view, you know?

43:13.937 --> 43:17.566
I'm sure he's very good. I'm very
impressed. You impressed, Jerry Lee?

43:17.649 --> 43:19.734
Show him, Jackie.

43:35.750 --> 43:39.922
Fat Tommy:
Jackie, stay away from that dog.

43:40.005 --> 43:44.717
Hey, Fat Tommy, what are you
worried about? He's a good doggie.

43:48.597 --> 43:51.892
Ooh!

43:51.975 --> 43:53.894
Good thing your boys
got a cup on, huh?

43:53.977 --> 43:57.856
Otherwise, he'd be known as
Little Jackie Hammer.

43:57.939 --> 44:00.066
I bet you got a lot
of money on this guy, huh?

44:00.150 --> 44:03.946
What kind of a psycho would teach
a dog to do something like that?

44:04.029 --> 44:06.782
Actually, he taught himself.
Jerry Lee.

44:13.914 --> 44:16.917
Yah!

44:21.347 --> 44:23.423
The name, fat man,
or the boy loses his nuts.

44:23.507 --> 44:26.802
Tell him. Please.

44:26.885 --> 44:30.723
- Phil Cage.
- Phil Cage? As in, "Phil's Salvage Yard"?

44:30.764 --> 44:33.225
- Yeah.
- Jerry Lee.

44:33.309 --> 44:36.144
You can let go now. Jerry!

44:42.568 --> 44:45.321
By the way, you look good.
You've lost a lot of weight.

44:45.404 --> 44:48.115
- Keep it up.
- Thanks, Dooley. I'm in the zone.

44:48.198 --> 44:50.993
Yeah, its workin' for you.

44:51.076 --> 44:54.455
Fat Tommy: I told you guys never
to get caught in the corner.

44:54.538 --> 44:56.808
- What was all that Kung Fu crap about?
- It wasn't Kung Fu.

44:56.832 --> 45:00.585
It was Krav Maga.
God, Dooley, get out of the 70s.

45:00.669 --> 45:03.756
Zeus and I trained for two months
at the Israeli Defense Force.

45:03.839 --> 45:07.051
Oh, yeah? What did they feed him?
"Kibbutz n' Bits"?

45:07.093 --> 45:09.679
Ah, "Kibbutz n' Bits."
Did you like that?

45:09.762 --> 45:13.181
Come on, now, I know you thought that
was funny. You're laughing inside.

45:13.265 --> 45:17.311
You shouldn't hold it in like that.
It's not good for your health.

45:31.200 --> 45:33.461
Phil's Salvage.
This is Phil speaking.

45:33.502 --> 45:36.831
Dooley and the police
are raiding your place in ten minutes.

45:36.873 --> 45:38.665
Who is this?

45:42.378 --> 45:44.714
Get the boys, get the money,

45:44.797 --> 45:46.716
get the guns, we gotta
get the hell out of here.

46:01.189 --> 46:04.942
This is the perfect place for your car.

46:05.025 --> 46:07.465
Shall I call and have a
black-and-white pick us up?

46:07.528 --> 46:10.615
Very funny. Cute. Almost quaint.

46:10.698 --> 46:12.867
I'm gonna go and talk to Phil.

46:12.951 --> 46:15.169
- I want you to stay in the car.
- What?

46:15.253 --> 46:17.079
- Stay!
- I'm not a dog.

46:17.163 --> 46:22.251
Well, that's obvious. Dogs listen.

46:22.335 --> 46:24.254
This time,
were going in the front.

46:24.337 --> 46:27.883
- Fine! Its your choice!
- Oh, you're actually giving me a choice?

46:27.966 --> 46:30.509
- Yeah. Front, back?
- Well take the front.

46:30.551 --> 46:33.346
- Fine.
- No, no, no, no, no. I see what you're doing here.

46:33.388 --> 46:35.765
- What do you want?
- I want the front.

46:35.849 --> 46:38.593
- Then we'll take the front.
- Well l'll take the back.

46:38.635 --> 46:43.030
- What happened to "Jerry Lee and I don't do back doors"?
- I'm trying to compromise, dear.

46:43.113 --> 46:44.899
- You want the back?
- Yes.

46:44.983 --> 46:47.444
- Then well take the back.
- Fine. I'll take the front.

46:47.527 --> 46:51.740
No way! That's what you wanted me to say,
and that's what you wanted me to take.

46:51.823 --> 46:55.493
- Well take the front.
- Fine! Take the front!

46:55.576 --> 46:59.080
- I don't care!
- Sure you don't. We'll take the back.

47:00.957 --> 47:03.919
- Zeus!
- Bad dog. Bad dog.

47:07.714 --> 47:10.300
Works every time. Come on.

47:23.730 --> 47:25.982
All right.
Keep your eyes open, Jer.

47:34.741 --> 47:37.418
Man: That you, Dooley?
Yeah, its me, Phil.

47:37.460 --> 47:40.330
Hey, Phil. What's goin' on here?
I thought you went legit.

47:40.372 --> 47:44.667
Oh, I could bullshit you, Dooley,
but the truth is, its easy money.

47:47.337 --> 47:49.631
Come on!

47:49.673 --> 47:52.509
- Those new guns, Phil?
- How do you like'em?

47:52.593 --> 47:55.638
Well, from this point of view,
they're quite impressive.

47:55.679 --> 47:57.647
You know, Phil,
this is your third strike.

47:57.689 --> 48:01.351
- They're gonna lock you up & throw away the key.
- Why do you think I'm shootin' at you?

48:01.435 --> 48:04.021
- Its nothin' personal.
- That's nice to hear.

48:04.104 --> 48:07.524
- That's very caring, loving and supportive.
- I had a good mother.

48:07.608 --> 48:09.859
Zeus, stay!

49:05.749 --> 49:07.668
Oh, boy.

49:09.629 --> 49:12.381
Dance! Dance!

49:12.422 --> 49:15.259
Dance!

49:16.927 --> 49:19.680
Ah, what is life if not to dance!

49:30.649 --> 49:34.862
- What kind of piece you usin'?
- 9mm, standard issue.

49:36.573 --> 49:40.159
- Yeah, I could set you up with something special.
- Yeah?

49:40.326 --> 49:43.579
Tell me about
that M-16 retrofit.

49:43.663 --> 49:46.374
Little too pricey for you, Dooley.

49:46.457 --> 49:48.668
- You got any names?
- I didn't ask it!

49:48.710 --> 49:53.096
- You know what he looked like?
- I wasn't looking at his face,
I was looking at the money.

49:53.138 --> 49:56.141
I'm sure he looked like your average,
creepy kind of gun nut.

49:56.183 --> 49:59.812
- A lot like you!
- Well, Phil, you're gonna need
that sense of humor...

49:59.854 --> 50:01.874
when they lock you away
for the rest of your life...

50:01.898 --> 50:04.365
Wearin' that
cute little sun dress.

50:07.853 --> 50:10.023
Okay.

50:19.532 --> 50:21.492
- You cook too?
- A lot of takeout.

50:25.997 --> 50:28.382
Cuff him. Call for backup.

50:28.465 --> 50:30.418
I'm goin' after Phil.

50:31.669 --> 50:34.130
Come on, Jerry Lee.

50:39.553 --> 50:41.512
Oh-oh-oh, man!

50:43.264 --> 50:45.266
Down! Down! My car!

51:01.241 --> 51:03.535
Move, move, move, move,
move, move, move!

51:03.577 --> 51:05.662
Down!

51:10.083 --> 51:12.419
My car!

51:12.460 --> 51:15.130
Oh, no.
Not the running thing again.

51:15.172 --> 51:17.299
Come on!

51:17.382 --> 51:19.550
Yeah, yeah. Look at that.
Look at that bike.

51:21.386 --> 51:24.347
Come on, come on!

51:28.018 --> 51:30.479
- Drop the gun!
- I can't.

51:47.037 --> 51:49.039
Jerry Lee? Where are you?

51:55.921 --> 51:57.839
Dooley: Jerry Lee!

52:10.685 --> 52:13.230
Oh! Oh! Holy shit!

52:24.741 --> 52:27.244
You're under arrest!

52:28.620 --> 52:31.248
You have the right
to remain unconscious.

52:31.332 --> 52:35.752
Anything you dream will be held
against you in a court of law.

52:35.836 --> 52:38.714
Its about time you got here, Jerry Lee!

52:48.348 --> 52:51.894
Jerry Lee?

53:00.235 --> 53:02.195
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

53:02.237 --> 53:06.333
Jerry Lees fine.
He only drinks water every couple days.

53:06.375 --> 53:08.035
Just like a camel.

53:08.077 --> 53:11.589
- Probably on his fathers side.
- That's an interesting trait.

53:11.672 --> 53:13.373
Its very efficient too.
He pees all at once.

53:15.459 --> 53:17.378
Is your dog on steroids
or something?

53:17.461 --> 53:20.631
- No. Why?
- I've never seen a dog like that not pant.

53:20.715 --> 53:23.134
He's not tired.

53:23.217 --> 53:25.636
- How old is Jerry Lee?
- Oh, I don't know.

53:25.719 --> 53:28.138
Well, how long have
you two been together?

53:28.180 --> 53:30.558
Its the longest relationship
I've ever had.

53:30.641 --> 53:32.560
You've got everything
tied up here,

53:32.643 --> 53:34.621
so we've got a couple of
personal things to take care of.

53:34.645 --> 53:36.564
Come on. Come on.

53:40.734 --> 53:43.237
Man: Ah, too bad, Dooley.
Where are the marshmallows?

53:43.320 --> 53:45.823
Can somebody give me a ride?

53:52.538 --> 53:54.790
Oh, this is a hill!

53:54.832 --> 53:57.126
Ohh.

54:01.005 --> 54:03.090
Ah, this is too much.

54:03.173 --> 54:05.092
Phew!

54:05.176 --> 54:08.721
You know, this isn't a bad mode
of transportation, Jerry Lee.

54:08.804 --> 54:11.432
No gasoline, no insurance.

54:11.516 --> 54:13.977
No parking tickets.

54:14.060 --> 54:17.146
I gotta get a little carriage seat
for you in the back, though.

54:21.192 --> 54:24.946
Hard day, huh, Jer?

54:25.029 --> 54:28.449
A lot of action today.

54:28.532 --> 54:30.826
Hey. Come here.

54:30.868 --> 54:32.995
Come up on my spot.

54:33.037 --> 54:37.375
You can sit up on my spot.
Attaboy.

54:37.417 --> 54:41.295
There you go.
I just love ya the way you are.

54:41.379 --> 54:44.549
Good dog. Powerful dog.

54:44.632 --> 54:48.428
Handsome dog. Pretty dog.

54:48.511 --> 54:51.640
Yeah.

54:51.723 --> 54:54.141
Hey, you want some chili?

54:54.225 --> 54:56.686
Oh, you want more brush?

54:56.769 --> 55:00.899
You want some chili?
I can make you some chili.

55:02.776 --> 55:05.945
Got pretty ears.
Look at your ears, how pretty they are.

55:06.028 --> 55:09.616
Look at that.
You're so handsome.

55:23.505 --> 55:27.426
Hmm.

55:36.643 --> 55:40.063
Hey! Hey! Hey, that's my car.

55:40.147 --> 55:43.233
No, no, no, no.
Its not junk. It's not junk.

55:43.316 --> 55:45.652
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on!

55:45.693 --> 55:48.488
Get this thing out of here.
No, no. Not my car.

55:48.530 --> 55:50.490
Get this garbage truck
out of here!

55:50.574 --> 55:53.202
Back it, back it. Back it.
Back it up. Up! Up! Up!

55:53.285 --> 55:55.829
Look, I just had it
towed back here.

55:57.121 --> 56:00.041
What the hell
do you think you're doin'?

56:00.125 --> 56:02.419
My car!

56:02.502 --> 56:04.963
For cryin out loud.

56:06.256 --> 56:08.175
A ticket!

56:08.259 --> 56:10.301
Jerry Lee?

56:14.848 --> 56:16.767
Hey, Jer?

56:16.850 --> 56:19.770
Made your favorite coffee.

56:19.853 --> 56:23.690
Half cream,
three tablespoons of sugar.

56:29.196 --> 56:31.156
Hey, Jer.

56:31.198 --> 56:33.159
I think its a good idea
you stay home today.

56:33.200 --> 56:35.368
Take a nap. Get a little rest.

56:35.452 --> 56:37.704
I'm gonna put on
some videos for ya.

56:37.746 --> 56:41.125
There, look, I got, uh-
I got Beethoven, your favorite.

56:41.208 --> 56:45.212
The original. Jer?

56:46.297 --> 56:48.340
Dooley: Oh, Jer.

57:01.770 --> 57:03.730
Jerry Lee?

57:06.066 --> 57:08.861
What are you doing?

57:08.944 --> 57:12.155
We can't go in this car.

57:12.239 --> 57:14.157
Jerry Lee, you can't go.

57:15.242 --> 57:17.202
You can't go to work
with me today.

57:17.286 --> 57:19.705
Jerry Lee, come on. Go inside.

57:20.957 --> 57:23.960
Go inside.

57:24.001 --> 57:26.170
Oh, you're playing
Mr. Deaf, are ya?

57:29.006 --> 57:32.218
Do you want a time-out?
You want a time-out?

57:32.301 --> 57:34.262
Fine. Time-out!

57:37.639 --> 57:40.267
Time-outs over. Now you're grounded.
You are grounded, young man.

57:40.309 --> 57:45.398
You go up into your room, no music,
no TV, no Beethoven, no park!

57:45.481 --> 57:47.442
You gotta go to the bathroom?
Backyard for you.

57:47.525 --> 57:49.735
Backyard!

57:49.818 --> 57:52.321
Come on!

57:52.404 --> 57:54.323
I'm gonna count to three,

57:54.407 --> 57:58.202
and if you're not upstairs,
in that room,

57:58.286 --> 58:00.204
you're in big trouble.

58:01.623 --> 58:03.999
One.

58:04.083 --> 58:06.001
Two.

58:08.504 --> 58:10.631
Two and a half.

58:10.673 --> 58:13.676
Three! Fine!

58:13.760 --> 58:16.679
Fine, go! Run away,

58:16.720 --> 58:19.348
Mr. Independent,
I-Dont-Need-Mr. Dooley!

58:19.390 --> 58:22.185
Go on, Jerry Lee!
Go with your friends!

58:22.226 --> 58:26.856
- Sure, grass is greener on the other side, huh?
- Who are you yelling at?

58:26.898 --> 58:30.401
- Jerry Lee.
- Why?

58:30.526 --> 58:34.447
Oh, Mr. Big Shot
decided to run away.

58:34.530 --> 58:36.449
All right, so, jump in the car.

58:36.533 --> 58:39.393
- Well go look for him. Zeus will seek him out.
- No, no, no, no.

58:39.419 --> 58:43.797
He has to come to me. That's the prodigal
son. He's gotta go and come back.

58:43.839 --> 58:48.670
I would be doing him damage if I went
and chased him down the street.

58:48.711 --> 58:51.298
I am not gonna do it.

58:51.381 --> 58:54.008
Jerry Lee?

58:54.091 --> 58:56.219
He's just been actin' so weird.

58:56.260 --> 58:59.347
- Did he ever run away before?
- No.

58:59.430 --> 59:03.101
- He's very sensitive.
- Just like you.

59:03.185 --> 59:06.103
I'm not sensitive. He's sensitive. I'm.

59:06.145 --> 59:08.314
I'm just moody.

59:11.568 --> 59:13.486
Dooley: Jerry Lee!

59:13.570 --> 59:16.365
Well, maybe Byers is right.

59:16.448 --> 59:19.625
- Maybe Jerry Lee just can't cut it anymore.
- Byers said that?

59:19.708 --> 59:22.078
- Yeah, more than once.
- So, that's why he assigned us to you.

59:22.120 --> 59:24.080
Yep.

59:25.123 --> 59:27.918
Where is he going?

59:29.294 --> 59:33.214
Dooley: There he is!

59:33.298 --> 59:36.635
Welles:
In front of the storage building.

59:36.676 --> 59:38.637
Jerry Lee!

59:38.678 --> 59:40.764
Jerry Lee, what are you doing?

59:42.349 --> 59:44.767
I'm sorry, Jerry Lee.
Did I hurt your feelings?

59:44.809 --> 59:49.314
- What's with you?
- He's not running away, Dooley.
He wants you to follow him.

59:51.650 --> 59:53.610
Zeus, come!

01:00:04.037 --> 01:00:06.707
- I think he's on to something.
- I hate stairs.

01:00:08.291 --> 01:00:10.210
Jerry Lee?

01:00:15.007 --> 01:00:18.010
What do you got?
He's keying in on something.

01:00:27.185 --> 01:00:29.646
Okay.

01:00:29.688 --> 01:00:31.774
Okay, Jerry Lee, back off.

01:00:31.857 --> 01:00:34.317
- Move out of the way.
- What are you doing?

01:00:34.359 --> 01:00:38.155
I'm picking the lock.
We do it all the time.

01:00:38.196 --> 01:00:40.157
That's what worries me.

01:00:40.199 --> 01:00:42.242
- You have a better idea?
- Yes.

01:00:42.368 --> 01:00:46.287
One of us will stake out the room from across
the hall, the other will go get a warrant.

01:00:46.371 --> 01:00:48.832
Jerry Lee and I
do not do warrants.

01:00:48.874 --> 01:00:50.834
Or back doors.
What else don't you do?

01:00:50.876 --> 01:00:54.505
We don't do flavored coffee. We don't
do aroma therapy. We don't do raw fish.

01:00:54.546 --> 01:00:56.549
- Normally known as sushi.
- Yes, we don't do that.

01:00:56.590 --> 01:00:59.301
We don't do tofu. We don't do collagen.
We don't do colonics.

01:00:59.384 --> 01:01:03.305
We don't do e-mail. We don't do head
shrinkers, group therapy, social workers.

01:01:03.388 --> 01:01:06.433
We don't do cute little doggy outfits.
We don't do shopping.

01:01:06.559 --> 01:01:10.438
- We don't do Near Beer or little speedos.
- Thank God.

01:01:10.479 --> 01:01:14.441
- And we don't do sporks.
- I get the point. I'll get the warrant.

01:01:14.524 --> 01:01:17.277
Don't touch the lock.

01:01:17.361 --> 01:01:21.616
And we don't do, "Ooh, is that a pimple
on your back? Can I squeeze it?"

01:01:32.626 --> 01:01:36.880
Jerry Lee, she didn't say we
can't touch that lock.

01:01:39.967 --> 01:01:42.303
That's it.

01:01:42.386 --> 01:01:45.848
You're a good singer.

01:01:48.685 --> 01:01:51.121
Okay, were done singing now.
All right? You happy?

01:01:51.145 --> 01:01:53.856
Stop it! Stop! Come on.
The bad guys gonna hear us.

01:01:53.939 --> 01:01:56.692
Yeah, see? Look. I could stuff you
and put you on the wall.

01:01:56.776 --> 01:01:59.737
See? Like a moose head.

01:02:10.164 --> 01:02:12.375
You know, you're
the best dog I ever had.

01:02:14.835 --> 01:02:18.672
You're the only dog I ever had,
but you're still the number one guy.

01:02:22.009 --> 01:02:24.178
You know, this is hard
for me to say, but-

01:02:30.935 --> 01:02:33.813
Get away from me. Is that
you? Was that you?

01:02:33.938 --> 01:02:37.192
Oh, my God! That is rancid!

01:02:44.073 --> 01:02:47.577
What did you eat?

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:49.913
Did you just cut another one?
Did you?

01:02:49.996 --> 01:02:53.249
There's something alien in you!

01:02:53.290 --> 01:02:56.085
Whew! Whew! Whew! Whew!

01:02:56.169 --> 01:02:59.005
You're off that
lamb and rice diet!

01:02:59.088 --> 01:03:01.466
Oh, God!

01:03:02.884 --> 01:03:05.678
Dooley!

01:03:05.761 --> 01:03:08.431
Oh!

01:03:09.474 --> 01:03:13.269
Oh! Oh!

01:03:13.353 --> 01:03:15.897
What is that smell?

01:03:15.939 --> 01:03:20.109
- What? What smell?
- Oh, don't tell me you don't
have a sense of smell.

01:03:20.193 --> 01:03:23.614
- My God! My eyes are watering.
- It was Jerry Lee!

01:03:23.697 --> 01:03:25.975
- Stop blaming the dog.
- Honest to God, it was Jerry Lee.

01:03:25.999 --> 01:03:28.618
That is so sad, man.
You need to go to a doctor.

01:03:28.702 --> 01:03:30.786
No! I swear! It was Jerry Lee!

01:03:30.828 --> 01:03:32.830
All right, I got the warrant.
Shoot off the lock.

01:03:34.499 --> 01:03:37.460
I advise you to wait, however,
considering the gas in this room.

01:03:37.544 --> 01:03:39.463
You're gonna blow us up.

01:03:43.674 --> 01:03:45.635
Seek.

01:03:52.809 --> 01:03:54.770
Oh, yeah,
he's a gun nut, all right.

01:03:56.104 --> 01:03:58.815
Welles:
Looks like he's some kind of writer.

01:03:58.898 --> 01:04:01.985
Everything's written
under a different name.

01:04:02.027 --> 01:04:04.446
He's got pictures of his girlfriend
or his wife hanging up.

01:04:08.324 --> 01:04:10.577
What?

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:14.498
Its not his wife. It's mine.

01:04:30.389 --> 01:04:32.349
Welles: They're picking
up the manuscripts later.

01:04:32.391 --> 01:04:35.936
So, what do you think? I mean, they're
all cop stories. Every one of ''em.

01:04:38.814 --> 01:04:40.858
Tracy was an editor.

01:04:42.359 --> 01:04:45.237
That rejection letter
she wrote was really nice.

01:04:46.363 --> 01:04:48.657
Tracy was nice in every way.

01:04:52.703 --> 01:04:56.040
That's why you disappeared
that night that we, um-

01:04:56.081 --> 01:04:58.375
Kissed?

01:04:58.416 --> 01:05:00.377
Yes.

01:05:00.418 --> 01:05:03.088
I'm sorry about that.

01:05:03.171 --> 01:05:07.426
No, don't be sorry. It was nothing to
apologize for. You just weren't ready.

01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:09.428
Maybe.

01:05:12.097 --> 01:05:16.435
Dooley, you really gotta stop
blaming yourself for what happened.

01:05:16.477 --> 01:05:18.771
No, I'm serious.
Listen, people die.

01:05:20.564 --> 01:05:22.608
That is a fact of life.

01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:25.694
You're a really good cop.

01:05:25.777 --> 01:05:29.865
And so is Jerry Lee.
You got really great instincts.

01:05:29.949 --> 01:05:33.411
You know?
And they can't teach you that.

01:05:33.452 --> 01:05:35.455
Trust me, I know.

01:05:36.788 --> 01:05:40.042
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:05:45.131 --> 01:05:48.635
- Is he gonna bite me?
- Probably.

01:05:48.676 --> 01:05:51.762
You know, that dog
is very co-dependent.

01:05:53.722 --> 01:05:56.642
- Can I take him in the other room?
- You can try.

01:06:00.146 --> 01:06:03.649
Zeus? Ham, cheese?

01:06:03.691 --> 01:06:06.193
Look what I got. Look what I got.

01:06:06.277 --> 01:06:08.654
Come on. Lets go
in the other room.

01:06:08.696 --> 01:06:10.656
That's good. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

01:06:10.698 --> 01:06:14.284
That's my finger.
No, that's my finger. That's my finger.

01:06:14.368 --> 01:06:17.162
You want a time-out?
Want a time-out? Want a time-out?

01:06:19.832 --> 01:06:22.627
My finger, my finger.
Let go, let go, let go.

01:06:22.668 --> 01:06:25.046
- Thank you.
- Dooley!

01:06:25.129 --> 01:06:27.298
- I'm not gonna share.
- Dooley, come here!

01:06:27.339 --> 01:06:30.092
- What?
- Come here.

01:06:30.176 --> 01:06:32.803
- What?
- This guy. This guy is writing about you.

01:06:32.845 --> 01:06:36.933
He's got everything. He's got the
bank shoot-out, Harry Stipe, Fat Tommy.

01:06:37.016 --> 01:06:41.061
- Who wrote this?
- Um, I don't know. A guy named Jeffery Barnes.

01:06:41.103 --> 01:06:43.773
- Probably a fake name.
- Barnes.

01:06:45.274 --> 01:06:48.152
- No.
- These all have different pen names.

01:06:48.236 --> 01:06:50.363
Who's the hero?

01:06:50.405 --> 01:06:52.406
Devon Lane.

01:06:52.448 --> 01:06:54.742
Right? Yeah. Devon Lane.

01:06:54.825 --> 01:06:57.912
Devon Lane. Devon Lane.

01:06:57.954 --> 01:07:02.792
I don't know why I-
I know Devon Lane.

01:07:02.876 --> 01:07:05.086
Devon Lane turned in
a manuscript to Tracy.

01:07:05.127 --> 01:07:08.214
She rejected it,
but she wanted me to meet with him...

01:07:08.256 --> 01:07:10.383
to talk to him about
what is was like to be a cop.

01:07:11.885 --> 01:07:13.887
He was really strange.

01:07:13.928 --> 01:07:16.348
He kept staring at her
through the whole-

01:07:16.431 --> 01:07:18.349
Wait.

01:07:18.432 --> 01:07:20.852
I'm gonna have an APB
put out on him immediately.

01:07:26.066 --> 01:07:28.443
- Good work.
- You too.

01:07:48.463 --> 01:07:50.465
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:07:51.207 --> 01:07:52.918
I'm kinda hungry.

01:07:53.001 --> 01:07:55.011
- You hungry? You wanna eat?
- Yeah.

01:07:55.094 --> 01:07:57.013
- Yes!
- I am a good cook.

01:07:57.096 --> 01:07:59.974
I am a great cook.
I'm gonna fix you something.

01:08:00.016 --> 01:08:02.269
Okay.

01:08:02.310 --> 01:08:04.730
You're gonna love it.
You're just gonna love it.

01:08:10.026 --> 01:08:12.904
I'll clean it up.
I'll clean it up.

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:18.993
Damn! I'm gonna get tupperware.

01:08:19.036 --> 01:08:21.346
Man On TV: The government bill to
crack down on laboratory experiments...

01:08:21.371 --> 01:08:25.000
on animals is expected
to become law today.

01:08:25.082 --> 01:08:27.961
Man on TV: then you should try
Smith Kennels Table Scrap Snacks.

01:08:28.002 --> 01:08:32.006
They taste and look just like the scraps
your dog begs for at the table.

01:08:32.049 --> 01:08:35.468
Small, delectable pieces
of toast crust, scrambled egg bits-

01:08:37.888 --> 01:08:41.600
Your dog will beg for more.
Here are some happy users.

01:08:41.683 --> 01:08:43.978
Man on TV: Yeah, I came home
for dinner late last night,

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:46.813
and I saw the dog was just
chomping away-

01:08:53.237 --> 01:08:56.115
"Coldsky." "Brrrsky."

01:08:58.575 --> 01:09:00.743
All right, all right.
I'm dropping it.

01:09:02.912 --> 01:09:04.872
Hey.

01:09:04.915 --> 01:09:07.084
Wanna go for a walk?

01:09:09.086 --> 01:09:11.337
Go for a walk?

01:09:14.925 --> 01:09:16.885
Watch her.

01:09:16.926 --> 01:09:19.054
Okay, don't move.

01:09:23.265 --> 01:09:26.603
Okay, a date.
I wanna take her out on a date.

01:09:26.687 --> 01:09:30.316
Date. "Daten-wagen."

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:33.778
"Daten-varganaire."
"Daten-schwarnenegger."

01:09:33.819 --> 01:09:38.323
Tulips.
Heineken, Amsterdam, clogs.

01:09:38.407 --> 01:09:40.826
I gotta get a Dutch dictionary.

01:09:42.536 --> 01:09:44.455
All right.

01:09:46.374 --> 01:09:49.417
I mean, she, you know-
She came on-What?

01:09:49.459 --> 01:09:51.420
You gotta go? You gotta go?

01:09:56.300 --> 01:10:00.972
You know, I like this neighbor. She's
a really nice old lady. You shouldn't-

01:10:01.054 --> 01:10:03.182
Oh, my God.

01:10:05.309 --> 01:10:08.896
All I got are twenties.
That's all I got is a twenty.

01:10:12.066 --> 01:10:15.319
Oh, my God!

01:10:15.402 --> 01:10:17.321
Man On TV:

01:10:17.404 --> 01:10:20.575
to order this revolutionary
new dog snack risk-free.

01:10:20.658 --> 01:10:22.577
If your dog
doesn't really love them,

01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:25.246
just return the unused portion
for a full refund.

01:10:25.330 --> 01:10:29.041
Smith Kennels Table Scrap Snacks-
the healthy alternative.

01:10:29.124 --> 01:10:31.836
If your pet experiences drowsiness,
hair loss or diarrhea-

01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:54.108
Good night, Zeus.

01:12:51.894 --> 01:12:53.812
Come on. Go to sleep.

01:12:55.022 --> 01:12:56.982
Go to sleep.

01:13:03.238 --> 01:13:05.407
Zeus, lets go.

01:13:59.670 --> 01:14:01.964
Good morning.

01:14:02.005 --> 01:14:04.216
Good morning.

01:14:05.426 --> 01:14:08.888
Good morning. "Guten-morning."

01:14:11.349 --> 01:14:14.226
What do you think?

01:14:14.309 --> 01:14:16.770
Like it?

01:14:16.854 --> 01:14:19.899
Okay, bud, its you and me.

01:14:20.983 --> 01:14:23.486
Don't blow it.

01:14:28.574 --> 01:14:30.785
Breakfast, anyone?

01:14:32.161 --> 01:14:34.831
Was it something we said?

01:14:36.749 --> 01:14:38.709
Did she leave?

01:14:41.962 --> 01:14:45.383
Well, its you and me again,
Jerry Lee. Come on, outside.

01:15:09.574 --> 01:15:13.745
Come on, come on, come on.
Leave me the marshmallows.

01:15:21.335 --> 01:15:24.756
She's calling, probably to apologize.
Come on.

01:15:32.513 --> 01:15:35.433
Hello. You know,
you could've stayed for breakfast.

01:15:35.475 --> 01:15:39.437
Devon I heard you finally got
around to reading my masterpiece.

01:15:39.521 --> 01:15:42.148
Poignant, huh?

01:15:42.273 --> 01:15:44.192
You wanna know the ending?

01:15:44.275 --> 01:15:48.071
If you get to her first, she lives.
If you don't, she dies.

01:15:48.113 --> 01:15:50.073
How's that for real, Dooley?

01:15:50.115 --> 01:15:52.701
See you soon.

01:15:59.707 --> 01:16:01.626
Shit.

01:16:02.794 --> 01:16:04.713
Where's that number?

01:16:16.183 --> 01:16:18.310
Pick it up. Pick it up.
Come on. Answer it.

01:16:21.896 --> 01:16:23.815
Pick it up!

01:16:25.650 --> 01:16:27.569
Damn it!

01:16:48.006 --> 01:16:49.925
Telephone Ringing.

01:16:53.971 --> 01:16:56.682
Byers. Hey, Dooley.

01:16:56.765 --> 01:16:59.525
What?
Wait, slow down. Slow down.

01:16:59.567 --> 01:17:01.228
What are you talking about?

01:17:01.269 --> 01:17:04.022
He's after her.
Welles, that's who! Welles!

01:17:04.106 --> 01:17:06.734
Oh, no, no. Come on. Huh?

01:17:06.859 --> 01:17:08.777
He would never come here.
He's not that crazy.

01:17:08.861 --> 01:17:11.947
Listen to me! Welles
You're completely surrounded.

01:17:12.072 --> 01:17:14.324
- Shut up!
- You're in a police station,

01:17:14.408 --> 01:17:16.326
- for Gods sakes.
- Oh, my God.

01:17:22.874 --> 01:17:24.876
Hey!

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:27.296
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?

01:17:27.379 --> 01:17:29.774
What are you doing with all these
tickets? You're following me!

01:17:29.798 --> 01:17:33.260
You got a vengeance-
A boot? You put-

01:17:33.302 --> 01:17:38.265
I need a ride! There's an emergency
going on. I need to take-

01:17:38.348 --> 01:17:40.559
Here. Here, I'm sorry.
You want this?

01:17:40.642 --> 01:17:42.811
You want this?
That's what I think-Hey!

01:17:45.439 --> 01:17:48.650
Get in. I'll show her.

01:17:50.903 --> 01:17:52.821
Hmm!

01:17:52.905 --> 01:17:55.991
Officer: Get down! Get down!

01:17:56.117 --> 01:17:59.162
- I can't see him!
Officer 2: We're under fire!

01:18:02.789 --> 01:18:05.000
Devon: Take your shot!

01:18:05.125 --> 01:18:09.130
Goddamn it! Put your gun down!
Byers: Hold your fire! Get down!

01:18:14.968 --> 01:18:17.680
- Stop that man!
Welles: Everybody get down!

01:18:17.805 --> 01:18:20.266
Devon: Shut up!
- Its all over.

01:18:22.685 --> 01:18:24.646
Byers:
Lay down, everybody! Lay down!

01:18:26.438 --> 01:18:28.816
Oh, for crying out loud.

01:18:46.034 --> 01:18:50.422
Byers:
Hold your fire! He's backing out!

01:18:50.547 --> 01:18:53.424
Okay, lets move up! Come on!
Officer: Move! Move!

01:18:53.507 --> 01:18:55.718
Come here!

01:18:55.801 --> 01:18:57.970
Zeus, go on back!

01:19:01.015 --> 01:19:03.226
Welles: Back up!

01:19:05.227 --> 01:19:08.314
- You'll never make it out of the building.
- That's not the ending I wrote.

01:19:11.150 --> 01:19:15.196
- Hey!
- Well, the good guy finally arrives,

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.615
just in time to see
another loved one die.

01:19:17.698 --> 01:19:19.742
Let her go.
This is between you and me.

01:19:19.825 --> 01:19:22.446
I got the station locked down, Dooley.
He can't get out.

01:19:22.471 --> 01:19:24.957
Now, put the gun down,
Devon, and nobody gets hurt!

01:19:25.282 --> 01:19:27.918
Did you know he killed his wife?

01:19:28.001 --> 01:19:32.255
I didn't kill her.
Tracy was very sick, and she died.

01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:35.341
Sick of you.
Sick of being a cops wife.

01:19:35.425 --> 01:19:38.094
You drove her to an early grave.

01:19:41.223 --> 01:19:44.475
Get your dog back.
Dooley: Can't do that.
Get him back, Dooley. 

01:19:45.685 --> 01:19:47.604
You think he listens to me?

01:19:47.687 --> 01:19:51.191
Get your dog back, Dooley. Get him
back, or Ill shoot him right now.

01:19:51.274 --> 01:19:53.235
Tracy loved that dog.

01:19:53.276 --> 01:19:55.987
- Loved that dog more than anything.
- Not more than me.

01:19:56.112 --> 01:19:59.949
- She didn't even know you!
- Yes, she did. She read my book.

01:20:00.033 --> 01:20:02.202
That's me in that book.

01:20:02.285 --> 01:20:05.622
She said I had potential.
She believed in me.

01:20:05.706 --> 01:20:08.875
Dooley: I'm sorry I didn't like your book.
You didn't even read it.

01:20:08.958 --> 01:20:10.919
I read part of it.

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:14.030
Devon: Tracy didn't have any
problems with my writing being real.

01:20:14.113 --> 01:20:18.302
- She liked my work!
- I won't shoot the dog. I'll shoot her.

01:20:18.385 --> 01:20:20.345
- Shoot him, Dooley. Just take him out.
- Shut up!

01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:22.764
- Shut up, Byers!
- Shut up, Byers!
- Shoot him!

01:20:22.847 --> 01:20:25.350
Shut up!
I'm not gonna shoot him.

01:20:25.475 --> 01:20:28.103
- He needs help!
- I don't need help.

01:20:28.186 --> 01:20:30.147
Yes, you do.

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:34.692
Tracy would want you
to get help.

01:20:34.776 --> 01:20:38.071
- She would?
- Yes, she would.

01:20:38.155 --> 01:20:40.824
- You're just saying that.
- No, I'm not.

01:20:40.908 --> 01:20:43.035
- You're lying to me.
- I'm not.

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.745
Yes, you are.
You're lying to me.

01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:49.332
All right. I'm lying to you.

01:20:49.416 --> 01:20:51.501
I can't help you.

01:20:51.585 --> 01:20:55.965
I don't wanna help you. You're an idiot.
You're a nut. You're a jerk.

01:20:56.048 --> 01:20:58.717
You understand English,
or do I need to speak in Dutch?

01:20:58.842 --> 01:21:01.720
Zeus!

01:21:12.714 --> 01:21:14.274
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:21:14.358 --> 01:21:16.819
Byers:
He's going upstairs! Let's go!

01:21:19.113 --> 01:21:21.449
Come on, Dooley!
You can make it!

01:21:24.868 --> 01:21:28.288
Only two more flights, Dooley!

01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:36.505
Devon: Come on, old man!

01:21:55.232 --> 01:21:58.653
I need E.M.S. vehicles and a SWAT team
on the roof. Right away!

01:21:58.736 --> 01:22:01.780
You're pathetic, Dooley!

01:22:04.366 --> 01:22:06.702
What Tracy saw in you,
I'll never know.

01:22:06.785 --> 01:22:08.788
You didn't deserve her!

01:22:11.290 --> 01:22:13.292
Aah!

01:22:22.051 --> 01:22:24.095
She said my character
was strong.

01:22:26.763 --> 01:22:28.849
She said I had potential!

01:22:42.988 --> 01:22:44.907
Come on, Dooley!

01:22:44.991 --> 01:22:47.118
Come on, old man!

01:22:49.304 --> 01:22:52.615
She wrote me a letter, Dooley!
She ever write you a letter?

01:22:52.650 --> 01:22:54.208
You moron!

01:22:54.291 --> 01:22:57.879
That letter she wrote you
was a rejection letter!

01:22:57.962 --> 01:23:00.048
Rejection?

01:23:00.173 --> 01:23:04.385
- Aah!
- How do you like the ending to my book, Dooley?

01:23:04.468 --> 01:23:07.722
- Do it!
- Ill do it when I'm ready.

01:23:07.805 --> 01:23:10.516
Do it!

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:13.144
Go ahead! Do it!

01:23:13.228 --> 01:23:15.689
Shut up!

01:23:15.730 --> 01:23:17.982
I'm in control here, Dooley.

01:23:18.065 --> 01:23:21.444
This is my story, not yours!

01:23:23.404 --> 01:23:26.157
Where do you want it?

01:23:26.241 --> 01:23:30.244
Cause I'm deciding where you
should get the next bullet.

01:23:30.369 --> 01:23:33.331
You got any preferences?

01:23:33.414 --> 01:23:35.750
Is this real enough for you,
Dooley?

01:23:40.881 --> 01:23:44.801
You did it! What took you so long?
Whimpering.

01:23:44.884 --> 01:23:48.430
I knew you could do it, buddy.

01:23:55.311 --> 01:23:57.647
Welles, cuff him.

01:24:24.132 --> 01:24:26.885
Wait!
You can't have dogs in here.

01:24:27.010 --> 01:24:29.346
They're police officers, ma'am.

01:24:29.088 --> 01:24:31.348
They're dogs!
Get them out of here.

01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:34.517
The California State Health Code,
section 4578, says absolutely...

01:24:34.601 --> 01:24:37.771
under no circumstances are dogs
allowed in the hospital.

01:25:28.655 --> 01:25:32.076
What? Come on. Jerry Lee.

01:25:32.117 --> 01:25:34.286
Come on. Don't slime me.
Your breath is so bad.

01:25:34.412 --> 01:25:37.497
What have you been eating?

01:25:38.707 --> 01:25:41.794
Okay. I'm okay.

01:25:41.919 --> 01:25:44.255
Don't do that!

01:25:44.421 --> 01:25:46.549
Welles, I wanna thank you
for picking me up.

01:25:46.591 --> 01:25:48.633
Are you actually showing me
some gratitude, Dooley?

01:25:48.717 --> 01:25:51.345
- Well, yeah, I'm trying.
- Good boy.

01:25:51.428 --> 01:25:53.555
- I am not a dog.
- Yes, you are.

01:25:53.597 --> 01:25:55.558
- Dogs get treats.
- Treats?

01:25:55.599 --> 01:25:57.977
Dinner. What do you want?
Chinese or Italian?

01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:00.228
Oh, you pick. Your choice.

01:26:00.270 --> 01:26:02.814
- Oh, you're actually giving me a choice?
- Yes, your choice.

01:26:02.898 --> 01:26:07.194
- Well, then I pick Chinese.
- Chinese is fine.

01:26:07.278 --> 01:26:10.615
No, that's what you wanted me to say.
We're going for Italian.

01:26:10.656 --> 01:26:13.158
- Well, Italian is fine.
- You actually want Italian?

01:26:13.241 --> 01:26:15.160
- Yes.
- Then we are going for Chinese.

01:26:15.244 --> 01:26:18.622
- Chinese is fine. I don't care.
- Yeah, sure you don't.

01:26:18.664 --> 01:26:21.000
Works every time, Jerry Lee.
