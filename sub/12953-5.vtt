01:32.663 --> 01:36.712
Honey, you're late.
I was getting worried.

01:36.806 --> 01:39.804
I'm sorry, beautiful.
I got hung up at work.

01:50.229 --> 01:51.746
It doesn't make any sense.

01:51.747 --> 01:53.831
What is so hard to
understand? Take a ball, right?

01:53.832 --> 01:56.332
You roll it. You knock over some pins,
and then everybody cheers for you.

01:56.352 --> 01:57.866
Or in your case, everyone laughs.

01:57.867 --> 01:58.711
That's true.

01:58.712 --> 01:59.797
How is that fun?

01:59.798 --> 02:01.503
How could she even ask such a thing?

02:01.504 --> 02:02.919
I think I know what your problem is.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.972
You've never had a
true bowling experience.

02:06.015 --> 02:08.398
We have bowling in Argentina, you know?

02:08.399 --> 02:10.958
Yes, but you don't have
like glow-in-the-dark pins.

02:11.051 --> 02:13.552
You don't have all-you-can-eat
hot dogs after 10:00

02:13.570 --> 02:16.070
or bad disco music
pumping through the stereo.

02:16.134 --> 02:17.553
You know what? Why am I
still talking about this?

02:17.554 --> 02:20.024
Let's just do it. We're
going bowling. Come on.

02:20.025 --> 02:21.527
Really?

02:21.528 --> 02:23.615
Yeah, yeah. Come on.
We're all going bowling.

02:23.616 --> 02:24.605
Now?

02:24.606 --> 02:25.928
Yeah. There's a 24-hour bowling alley.

02:25.929 --> 02:27.730
- That's not the point.
- We have work tomorrow.

02:27.731 --> 02:30.058
Guys, you don't have to
analyze everything you do.

02:30.059 --> 02:32.818
You can just decide
to have fun. It's okay.

02:32.911 --> 02:33.901
We're fun.

02:33.902 --> 02:37.282
Yeah. You guys are about as spontaneous
as my grandparents... and they're dead.

02:37.375 --> 02:39.510
- Look, it's wednesday night.
- We're not going bowling.

02:39.511 --> 02:40.979
All right, well, suit yourself.
Big kids are going out.

02:40.980 --> 02:44.436
How can I resist all-you-can-eat
hot dogs after 10:00?

02:44.528 --> 02:47.049
- Don't wait up.
- Let's go.

02:49.153 --> 02:51.653
We don't analyze everything we do.

02:52.180 --> 02:53.966
Do we?

02:53.967 --> 02:56.008
No, no, we don't.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.046
And besides, we agreed
to take things slow.

02:58.047 --> 02:59.593
Right.

02:59.594 --> 03:02.094
We're choosing not to be spontaneous.

03:02.150 --> 03:04.650
Exactly.

03:08.150 --> 03:10.650
And that's why they call
us when something's wrong.

03:10.759 --> 03:13.259
- Vaughn.
- Yeah?

03:13.854 --> 03:16.275
Six hours ago, an electromagnetic weapon

03:16.276 --> 03:18.221
was stolen from a warehouse in Kostroma.

03:18.222 --> 03:20.356
Now this thing is a prototype.

03:20.357 --> 03:24.216
Really bad news. Repeatable
core, amplified radius.

03:24.309 --> 03:28.309
And you guys know what
electromagnetic pulse does, right?

03:28.401 --> 03:30.776
Destroys electronic
equipment, melts circuitry.

03:30.777 --> 03:32.146
Right. Now, if this baby goes off,

03:32.147 --> 03:35.193
anything within a 10-mile radius
that contains electronic parts, like

03:35.332 --> 03:39.411
computers, radios, cars, radar
... everything will be fried.

03:39.503 --> 03:42.645
If a terrorist were to detonate
this in a major metropolitan city,

03:42.693 --> 03:44.540
the casualties would be extreme.

03:44.541 --> 03:46.293
Hospitals would lose power.

03:46.294 --> 03:48.524
Traffic grids would be destroyed.

03:48.525 --> 03:49.990
Airplanes fall from the sky.

03:49.991 --> 03:51.028
I mean, it's really...

03:51.029 --> 03:53.741
oh, and the most impressive
thing about this particular device

03:53.787 --> 03:55.254
is its repeatable core.

03:55.255 --> 03:57.101
You could black out Los Angeles

03:57.102 --> 04:00.387
and then use it to take down
San Francisco in the same day.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.801
Who's the thief?

04:01.802 --> 04:03.554
His name is Yuri Kurelko,

04:03.555 --> 04:07.699
former KGB officer currently reported
to have ties with an extremist group

04:07.794 --> 04:09.593
known as the October Contingent.

04:09.594 --> 04:10.773
The russian ultranationalists.

04:10.774 --> 04:14.154
That's right. Largely ex-military.
But they're looking for new recruits.

04:14.246 --> 04:17.387
Three days ago, german authorities
picked up a man and a woman

04:17.481 --> 04:20.623
attempting to smuggle weapons
through a customs checkpoint.

04:20.668 --> 04:24.956
Subsequent interrogation revealed
them to be Dimitry and Ilyana Tabakov,

04:25.095 --> 04:27.278
suspected chechnyan mercenaries.

04:27.279 --> 04:29.799
Under duress they disclosed
the October Contingent

04:29.846 --> 04:32.461
has made back channel overtures
toward them to join their group.

04:32.555 --> 04:35.122
Sydney and Vaughn, you will
impersonate the Tabakovs,

04:35.216 --> 04:37.349
infiltrate the contingent.

04:37.350 --> 04:40.778
Your mission is twofold. You will
identify the group's objective

04:40.824 --> 04:43.102
and retrieve the electromagnetic weapon.

04:43.103 --> 04:46.579
Sydney, Vaughn, you know any attempt
to communicate with you on our end

04:46.673 --> 04:48.330
might jeopardize your lives.

04:48.331 --> 04:49.538
So we're on our own.

04:49.539 --> 04:50.956
Not quite. Marshall.

04:50.957 --> 04:51.993
Yes. Uh...

04:51.994 --> 04:57.523
What I have here is a
normal, everyday wristwatch.

04:57.663 --> 04:59.272
Now, under normal uses,

04:59.273 --> 05:01.409
it won't alarm any
countersurveillance scans,

05:01.410 --> 05:03.592
but once activated,

05:03.593 --> 05:06.448
it will give us the GPS coordinates
to triangulate your position.

05:06.914 --> 05:10.055
Oh, and it is also capable
of short-burst transmissions.

05:10.148 --> 05:11.328
You can send images.

05:11.329 --> 05:13.321
And we'll monitor you as best we can.

05:13.322 --> 05:15.218
And if we detect that
your cover is in jeopardy,

05:15.219 --> 05:16.379
we'll send the abort signal.

05:16.380 --> 05:19.141
I want you to extricate
yourselves immediately.

05:19.233 --> 05:22.613
Your plane leaves in an hour.
I wish you well. Good luck.

06:03.423 --> 06:06.087
We are able to get by, yeah.

06:09.891 --> 06:12.411
What would you like me to say?

06:13.018 --> 06:15.518
I think that'll do just fine.

06:15.952 --> 06:17.180
I gotta tell you,

06:17.181 --> 06:20.036
you two are half as good as
rumored, we're really in for a treat.

06:20.128 --> 06:22.263
Come on. Hop on in. Let's
get you out of the rain.

06:22.264 --> 06:24.764
My name's Tom, by the way.

06:29.255 --> 06:32.301
NRO retasked a keyhole
satellite for infrared flyover,

06:32.393 --> 06:35.199
picked them up on the M8 shortly
after Sydney began transmitting.

06:35.293 --> 06:36.424
Destination?

06:36.425 --> 06:38.903
Well, the nearest
city in that area is...

06:38.904 --> 06:41.115
Petrozavodsk.

06:41.116 --> 06:42.580
It's about 12 hours away.

06:42.581 --> 06:43.617
What else is in the area?

06:43.618 --> 06:46.118
Nothing, really.
Farmland, tundra, turnips.

06:46.136 --> 06:47.841
Let me know the moment
that van stops moving.

06:47.842 --> 06:50.342
You got it, boss.

06:53.739 --> 06:56.642
This is Nick. He's gonna take
some photos of you for our project.

06:56.735 --> 07:00.593
And this project involves us speaking
English like americans for some reason?

07:00.687 --> 07:01.848
Well, first order of business,

07:01.849 --> 07:04.031
we need to establish some
new identities for you two,

07:04.032 --> 07:09.083
and something tells me
that David and Karen Parker

07:09.177 --> 07:12.268
don't exactly spend a lot of time
speaking in the russian tongue.

07:12.362 --> 07:14.594
Don't worry. We'll go over everything
when we get to Liberty Village.

07:14.595 --> 07:17.095
In the meantime, just sit
back and enjoy the ride.

07:17.253 --> 07:19.753
You just became americans.

07:54.586 --> 07:57.776
I want to know more about this group
that Sydney and Vaughn have infiltrated

07:57.868 --> 08:01.917
so, Jack, I'm recommending that
you reach out Alexei Vassilyvich.

08:02.290 --> 08:04.551
Any objections?

08:04.552 --> 08:06.823
He'll want something in return.

08:06.824 --> 08:07.950
Yeah.

08:07.951 --> 08:11.042
Look, Jack, I can task another agent
if you feel this is something...

08:11.090 --> 08:15.407
I simply questioned whether it's prudent
to involve him at this point considering...

08:16.808 --> 08:18.300
Yes, Marshall?

08:18.301 --> 08:21.564
Uh, Mr. Sloane, you're
gonna want to come see this.

08:21.657 --> 08:24.157
Okay.

08:24.842 --> 08:27.151
I think I found something.

08:27.152 --> 08:29.478
About an hour ago, the
van left the highway.

08:29.479 --> 08:32.955
They followed access roads to
this facility... Suberov 13.

08:33.048 --> 08:34.991
It's supposed to have been
abandoned in the late '70s.

08:34.991 --> 08:35.886
Perimeter controls,

08:35.888 --> 08:38.885
manned gun emplacements along the
access roads, active airfields.

08:38.932 --> 08:40.871
It certainly doesn't look deserted.

08:40.873 --> 08:42.139
Marshall, can you put
that on the screen?

08:42.140 --> 08:44.640
Yeah. Let me just...

08:45.265 --> 08:47.765
There it is.

08:49.259 --> 08:51.106
Is that military housing?

08:51.107 --> 08:53.122
Not like any I've seen.

08:53.123 --> 08:55.623
Russian base housing resemble barracks.

08:56.898 --> 08:59.943
Those are single-family homes
with lawns and cul-de-sacs.

09:00.037 --> 09:01.631
Is that a swing set?

09:01.632 --> 09:04.132
Looks like my neighborhood.

09:29.314 --> 09:31.814
Hope you guys like your new house.

09:32.606 --> 09:35.631
I love mine. It's
almost exactly the same.

09:35.724 --> 09:38.386
I just hope the guests
haven't trashed the place.

09:38.433 --> 09:40.933
We have guests?

09:43.962 --> 09:46.178
This shouldn't be too long.

09:46.179 --> 09:50.399
We just have to do a, well,
an initiation of sorts.

09:51.378 --> 09:53.878
Don't worry. Shouldn't be too painful.

09:55.855 --> 10:00.523
Everyone, guys, allow me to
present David and Karen Parker.

10:00.662 --> 10:03.708
- Hey, welcome, guys.
- Nice to meet you.

10:03.754 --> 10:06.008
- Hi.
- Hello.

10:06.009 --> 10:07.851
Welcome to the neighborhood.

10:07.852 --> 10:10.352
Thank you.

10:45.168 --> 10:48.356
The town's officially known
as training sector 56b,

10:48.479 --> 10:52.287
but students started calling it Liberty
Village sometime during the mid '80s.

10:52.427 --> 10:55.377
Trying to capture that american
sense of irony, I suppose.

10:55.468 --> 10:57.221
So this is a government operation?

10:57.222 --> 10:59.742
It was a government operation, Karen,

10:59.837 --> 11:01.875
but it's a private enterprise
now, which is fine with us,

11:01.876 --> 11:04.376
because it gives us the
freedom to do our job.

11:05.177 --> 11:08.366
What exactly is our job, Tom?

11:09.346 --> 11:13.776
Well, right now your job
is to prove that you belong.

11:14.056 --> 11:15.856
You're under evaluation.

11:15.857 --> 11:19.092
We need to be sure that you can
portray americans convincingly.

11:19.185 --> 11:22.374
From this point on, assume that
everything is a test, you understand?

11:23.916 --> 11:25.095
Excellent.

11:25.096 --> 11:26.610
Now let's go do some
formal introductions

11:26.611 --> 11:29.111
so you can get to know
your new neighbors.

11:39.170 --> 11:40.207
They're transmitting.

11:40.208 --> 11:42.056
It is so nice to finally meet you.

11:42.057 --> 11:42.618
Thank you.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.800
We've been looking forward
to this for quite some time.

11:44.801 --> 11:47.301
Believe me, we have been, too.

11:47.733 --> 11:49.054
Marshall.

11:49.055 --> 11:50.658
Working on it.

11:50.659 --> 11:53.609
Hold on. Wait a sec.

11:55.058 --> 11:57.558
Come on.

11:57.866 --> 11:59.368
Got it.

11:59.369 --> 12:02.128
Sergei Danislov and Elena Vasya.

12:02.220 --> 12:03.256
Weapons, drugs.

12:03.257 --> 12:06.351
Suspected terrorist affiliations
include the Novgorod authorit...

12:06.444 --> 12:10.491
They're responsible for the Grozny
bombing in '98. They killed 47 people.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.859
I went ahead and did a
little shopping for you.

12:12.860 --> 12:15.522
You have a bunch of clothes in your
closet upstairs you need to go through.

12:15.569 --> 12:18.948
Honey, please, there'll be plenty
of time to talk about shopping later.

12:19.799 --> 12:23.078
And this is Bill and Donna Johnson.

12:23.172 --> 12:24.494
They live in the house just next to you.

12:24.495 --> 12:26.146
- Hi there.
- Hi.

12:26.147 --> 12:28.375
Anatoli and Tatiana Sedova.

12:28.376 --> 12:32.034
Former GRU. They're wanted
by british authorities

12:32.096 --> 12:34.317
in connection with a bank
robbery that left seven dead.

12:34.318 --> 12:37.410
And of course, Ken and Linda Taylor.

12:37.550 --> 12:39.064
Linda. Hi.

12:39.065 --> 12:42.158
Raisa Tupokov and Nikolai Brekev.

12:42.344 --> 12:45.962
Contract killers, russian mafia ties,
known murders in the double digits.

12:46.522 --> 12:48.418
We just moved in a few days ago.

12:48.419 --> 12:49.788
You are going to love it here.

12:49.789 --> 12:51.495
- That's good to hear.
- Great.

12:51.496 --> 12:53.139
And of course...

12:53.140 --> 12:54.654
my lovely wife Dianne.

12:54.655 --> 12:56.549
- Hello.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

12:56.550 --> 12:58.304
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

12:58.305 --> 13:02.256
Marina Avdin, former chief interrogator
at the Markova detention center.

13:02.397 --> 13:04.385
I was just looking at your photo.

13:04.386 --> 13:07.337
Tom and I just adore Rome.
How long ago were you there?

13:09.486 --> 13:10.713
Oh, what was it, five years ago?

13:10.714 --> 13:11.845
Has it been that long?

13:11.846 --> 13:13.120
Yeah. We were going
too for the millennium,

13:13.121 --> 13:14.729
but we didn't want
to fly because of Y2K.

13:14.730 --> 13:16.388
At the time, it was a big deal.

13:16.389 --> 13:17.951
So we decided to go in the spring.

13:17.952 --> 13:19.827
Loved it. No crowds, no tourists.

13:19.828 --> 13:22.328
We even got to hear the pope speak.

13:23.497 --> 13:25.133
Yeah, yeah, that was pretty good.

13:25.134 --> 13:27.554
Yeah. I liked the part about Y2K.

13:27.555 --> 13:28.735
You can do a lot better, though.

13:28.736 --> 13:29.818
Oh, without a doubt.

13:29.819 --> 13:32.240
But don't worry. We're not
gonna kill you over a bad story.

13:32.241 --> 13:34.741
Not on the first night, anyway.

13:39.234 --> 13:40.922
What's the connection?

13:40.923 --> 13:44.491
Why is the Contingent associating with
terrorists, thieves, contract killers?

13:44.584 --> 13:46.911
More importantly, why are they
all dressed up like the Cleavers?

13:46.912 --> 13:48.473
They must be using the facility

13:48.474 --> 13:50.609
as a training ground for
some impending operation.

13:50.610 --> 13:53.225
It is unlikely a terrorist
group could gain unlimited access

13:53.272 --> 13:56.366
to a russian military base without
some kind of state sponsorship.

13:56.458 --> 13:58.732
Jack, talk to Alexei.

13:58.733 --> 14:01.233
I'll leave the negotiations
to your discretion.

14:01.294 --> 14:02.951
Do we hold off on the abort code?

14:02.952 --> 14:06.954
For now. But be ready. This
situation could deteriorate rapidly.

14:07.093 --> 14:09.226
This is my 3-layer casserole.

14:09.227 --> 14:10.264
Oh, thank you.

14:10.265 --> 14:12.879
Just enjoy. We'll later
go over the recipe.

14:13.112 --> 14:15.612
Ahem.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.356
We'll go over the recipe later.

14:20.450 --> 14:21.855
I can't wait.

14:21.856 --> 14:24.124
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.

14:24.125 --> 14:28.030
- Take care, all, all right?
- Good night. Thank you.

14:28.592 --> 14:31.349
So... it's a lot to take in, isn't it?

14:31.442 --> 14:34.010
It's different from our usual jobs.

14:34.150 --> 14:36.650
Not to worry. You guys are doing great.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.930
Just a couple things to keep in mind.

14:40.069 --> 14:42.638
We recruited you because
you're a couple. Embrace it.

14:42.730 --> 14:44.961
Americans love to show
affection for each other.

14:44.962 --> 14:46.191
You two...

14:46.192 --> 14:47.590
you seem a little cold.

14:47.591 --> 14:48.818
We're not cold.

14:48.819 --> 14:51.701
I know, I know. First night's a
common problem. Don't sweat it.

14:51.794 --> 14:54.887
Oh, and just one more thing. We
have a little homework for you.

14:55.915 --> 14:57.267
You want us to eat this pie?

14:57.268 --> 15:00.552
It's a little welcome gift. Open it up.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.360
Are you familiar with the new Tokorev?

15:05.404 --> 15:07.253
Get familiar. You'll need it tomorrow.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.389
Make sure you can assemble
it in under 20 seconds.

15:09.390 --> 15:11.791
And don't forget to put
Tammy's casserole in the fridge.

15:11.792 --> 15:14.062
That third layer's tuna.

15:14.063 --> 15:15.912
All right well, we'll see you tomorrow.

15:15.913 --> 15:18.413
- Sleep well.
- Good night.

15:18.611 --> 15:21.111
- Bye-bye now.
- Bye.

15:24.503 --> 15:26.054
Huh.

15:26.055 --> 15:28.555
Yeah.

15:30.140 --> 15:31.494
What the hell is going on?

15:31.495 --> 15:32.530
Yeah, it's like a weird nightmare.

15:32.531 --> 15:34.809
That we're trapped in. Did you
see the security when we arrived?

15:34.810 --> 15:36.229
It's like an entire military division.

15:36.230 --> 15:37.840
Why would they go to this much trouble?

15:37.841 --> 15:38.766
They must be planning an attack.

15:38.767 --> 15:39.783
On what, suburbia?

15:39.784 --> 15:41.728
Maybe some sort of
long-term infiltration.

15:41.729 --> 15:43.291
Why steal the E.M.P. if it's long-term?

15:43.292 --> 15:45.473
Why train operatives to be
american if it's short-term?

15:45.474 --> 15:47.658
I'm not saying it's logical.
They asked us to play charades.

15:47.659 --> 15:50.274
That's an act. They're well
organized, they're professional.

15:50.320 --> 15:51.118
It's part of their test.

15:51.119 --> 15:52.234
Which apparently we're failing.

15:52.235 --> 15:53.462
Oh, come on, that was ridiculous.

15:53.463 --> 15:55.788
What did they expect us to do,
just drop and go at it on the floor?

15:55.789 --> 15:57.112
If one more person calls us boring...

15:57.113 --> 15:59.919
He didn't call us
boring. He called us cold.

16:00.013 --> 16:01.903
Who thinks we're boring?

16:01.904 --> 16:04.371
Nobody. That's not the
point. How do we proceed?

16:04.372 --> 16:07.275
We have to assume they're tracking
our every move. We maintain cover.

16:07.369 --> 16:09.869
Yeah, so just act like
we have nothing to hide.

16:09.933 --> 16:12.068
I'll do some reconnaissance,
see if I can locate the E.M.P.

16:12.069 --> 16:14.590
Okay, in the meantime, one of
us should start on our homework.

17:48.747 --> 17:51.247
Can I help you with something?

17:52.232 --> 17:54.732
You scared me.

17:55.288 --> 17:56.802
I thought you might still be up.

17:56.803 --> 18:00.420
I wanted to thank Dianne for
that bath salt kit she left us.

18:00.466 --> 18:02.966
That was really nice.

18:04.362 --> 18:06.862
How'd you know this was our house?

18:07.479 --> 18:09.979
Your name's on the mailbox.

18:12.411 --> 18:14.430
What are you, out for a jog?

18:14.431 --> 18:16.231
I needed to clear my head.

18:16.232 --> 18:20.405
Good chance to do some
reconnaissance as well, I'd imagine.

18:22.788 --> 18:25.547
So what's your assessment
of our little town?

18:30.454 --> 18:32.330
Strong military perimeter.

18:32.331 --> 18:34.697
Armed guards, rotating patrol.

18:34.698 --> 18:37.506
Not a lot of people
getting in... or out...

18:37.598 --> 18:40.098
if you don't want them to.

18:40.151 --> 18:42.814
Lack of obvious security
presence within the town itself

18:42.890 --> 18:47.032
suggests heavy surveillance. Security
cameras in all the street lights.

18:47.124 --> 18:49.497
In this immediate area,
judging from the power lines,

18:49.498 --> 18:52.401
one of those houses is
probably a guard station.

18:52.494 --> 18:53.482
Yeah.

18:53.483 --> 18:55.905
First sign of trouble, we sound
the alarm, lock down the streets,

18:55.906 --> 18:58.087
give the snipers the
go-ahead to fire at hostiles.

18:58.088 --> 19:00.846
It's our version of the
neighborhood watch program.

19:00.987 --> 19:03.487
Helps everyone sleep well at night.

19:08.634 --> 19:10.983
Anyway...

19:10.984 --> 19:13.791
don't stay up too late,
okay? Got a big day tomorrow.

19:18.559 --> 19:22.702
Oh! Um, I'll be sure and tell
Dianne about the bath salts.

19:23.076 --> 19:26.072
- Thank you, Tom.
- You're welcome, Karen.

19:26.118 --> 19:28.618
- Good night.
- Good night.

19:33.960 --> 19:37.579
- How was your run?
- Great. I ran into Tom.

19:40.850 --> 19:42.841
I don't really sleep well at night.

19:42.842 --> 19:45.342
Well, that's a relief.

20:28.038 --> 20:30.538
Hello, Jack.

20:33.051 --> 20:34.927
Alexei.

20:34.928 --> 20:37.339
What can I do for you?

20:37.340 --> 20:41.674
There's a military facility 300
miles southeast of Petrozavodsk.

20:41.721 --> 20:43.426
I assume you're familiar with it.

20:43.427 --> 20:46.281
We train some of our
best operatives there.

20:49.645 --> 20:52.882
I need to know if the government is
still running active operations out of it.

20:55.639 --> 20:59.496
Well, it depends how you
define government, I suppose.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.661
I have assets in play
within the facility.

21:02.662 --> 21:06.043
We may require assistance
with their extraction.

21:08.705 --> 21:12.420
This is not some fringe group
we're talking about, Jack.

21:12.513 --> 21:15.988
The people who control that base
may not have official sanction,

21:16.222 --> 21:20.554
but there are many in power who
look upon their actions favorably.

21:20.694 --> 21:25.458
You would have my gratitude
for any assistance rendered.

21:25.738 --> 21:29.309
While that has warmed my heart,

21:29.448 --> 21:33.257
I'm afraid the reward
does not outweigh the risk.

21:34.892 --> 21:37.392
What do you want, Alexei?

21:37.827 --> 21:41.350
Well, now that you mention it,

21:41.816 --> 21:45.147
perhaps there is something
you can do for me.

21:48.278 --> 21:50.778
- Good morning, Tom.
- Morning, Cheryl.

21:59.759 --> 22:02.282
Rise and shine. Got ourselves a big day.

22:02.420 --> 22:03.553
- Karen.
- Hi, Tom.

22:03.554 --> 22:06.054
Aren't you just the picture of radiant?

22:07.514 --> 22:09.364
Good morning. Oh, how'd you sleep, Dave?

22:09.365 --> 22:10.544
Ah, like a baby.

22:10.545 --> 22:12.540
Hey, look at that. We're
wearing the same shirt.

22:12.541 --> 22:14.292
You'd be amazed how
often that happens here.

22:14.293 --> 22:16.763
Guess we'll be twins
today. Shall we head out?

22:16.764 --> 22:17.753
Should I bring the gun?

22:17.754 --> 22:20.254
Nah, you'll be provided with one.

22:24.606 --> 22:26.166
We have a working gas
station, movie theater.

22:26.167 --> 22:27.969
- Hi, Tom.
- Hey.

22:27.970 --> 22:29.960
Supermarkets, bowling alley.

22:29.961 --> 22:31.524
Why would the government
need a bowling...

22:31.525 --> 22:33.420
Too many agents were getting
burned in the '50s.

22:33.421 --> 22:34.888
Soviets couldn't grasp the culture,

22:34.889 --> 22:37.167
so they immersed themselves in it.

22:37.168 --> 22:39.399
Found out there's no
substitute for the real thing.

22:39.400 --> 22:43.383
Oh, hey, that reminds me. I,
uh, have another little gift.

22:43.521 --> 22:45.227
If you two are gonna be a couple,

22:45.228 --> 22:47.843
you may as well be dressing the part.

22:51.488 --> 22:53.459
I just figured that
might help with your...

22:53.460 --> 22:55.960
you know, intimacy issues.

23:09.396 --> 23:11.896
Oh. Mr. Bristow, you shouldn't have.

23:11.921 --> 23:14.442
Irina Derevko collected
19th century literature.

23:14.533 --> 23:16.238
There was a small bookstore in Prague

23:16.239 --> 23:18.739
that stocked rare first editions.

23:18.934 --> 23:22.314
Whenever I was in town, I'd
buy one for her as a gift.

23:22.593 --> 23:25.496
Oh. That's sweet.

23:25.589 --> 23:28.443
The KGB encoded assassination
orders in these pages.

23:28.537 --> 23:30.859
Oh. Well, that's...

23:30.860 --> 23:32.612
not as sweet.

23:32.613 --> 23:34.891
The NSA deciphered all
the codes in these books,

23:34.892 --> 23:37.842
but Irina's former resident
chief just asked for them back,

23:37.936 --> 23:42.413
which means there's something in
here the NSA overlooked. Find it.

23:45.106 --> 23:46.812
It's not a novel concept.

23:46.813 --> 23:48.327
Trust me, somewhere in America,

23:48.328 --> 23:51.135
CIA agents are sitting
around in a fake Peroskovia

23:51.228 --> 23:53.362
practicing their russian table manners.

23:53.363 --> 23:55.683
You built a used car dealership?

23:55.684 --> 23:59.494
Training station 327-F,
home of the Krilov scenario.

23:59.587 --> 24:02.537
Your objective is simple.
You have to buy a convertible.

24:02.657 --> 24:03.533
What?

24:03.534 --> 24:06.245
You'll be evaluated on
characterization, reflex analysis,

24:06.338 --> 24:08.804
emotional response,
and physical endurance.

24:08.805 --> 24:10.174
Physical endurance?

24:10.175 --> 24:11.927
Welcome to Liberty Village automotive.

24:11.928 --> 24:13.298
Good luck.

24:13.299 --> 24:15.577
You folks must have heard
about our democracy sale.

24:15.578 --> 24:18.078
We've got 0% financing for 72 months

24:18.095 --> 24:21.236
and a mind-blowing selection
of pre-owned stepsides.

24:21.375 --> 24:24.373
Uh, well, actually, Phil,
we're here to buy a convertible.

24:24.559 --> 24:26.455
You sure about that?

24:26.456 --> 24:27.970
Because we only have one convertible,

24:27.971 --> 24:30.633
and it's a pretty fast car.

24:30.708 --> 24:33.208
That's how we live Phil... fast.

24:34.676 --> 24:37.176
Okay.

24:38.466 --> 24:41.368
Few things scream freedom
like a brand-new convertible.

24:41.461 --> 24:44.603
You put the top down, and
excitement blows through your hair.

24:46.537 --> 24:50.109
What's it gonna take to get us
over the curb in this baby, Phil?

24:51.371 --> 24:53.854
You guys are first-time
buyers, aren't you?

24:53.855 --> 24:55.129
Is it that obvious?

24:55.130 --> 24:57.985
Well, you don't get to be regional
sales associate of the month

24:58.078 --> 25:00.694
four times in a row without
knowing how to read people.

25:01.113 --> 25:03.192
Newlyweds, right?

25:03.193 --> 25:05.693
Relative newlyweds.

25:05.797 --> 25:08.297
Let's see that ring.

25:10.955 --> 25:13.476
How'd he pop the question?

25:14.158 --> 25:16.658
He... took me to...

25:16.723 --> 25:19.481
Santa Barbara, actually.

25:22.286 --> 25:25.093
I had this whole
romantic weekend planned.

25:26.261 --> 25:28.348
Presidential suite at the Biltmore.

25:28.349 --> 25:31.107
Candlelit dinner on the
cliffs overlooking the ocean.

25:32.461 --> 25:34.353
So we went into town,

25:34.354 --> 25:36.854
and she wouldn't stop
talking about the zoo.

25:37.199 --> 25:39.720
So we went to the zoo.

25:39.953 --> 25:42.453
Figured I'd get it over with.

25:48.069 --> 25:51.401
And then I saw how happy it made her.

25:51.493 --> 25:53.993
It made me forget about
all my stupid plans.

25:54.852 --> 26:00.477
And here we had a personal chef making
this unbelievable meal at the hotel, but...

26:01.037 --> 26:05.467
I proposed on one knee in sawdust in
front of a giraffe with a crooked neck.

26:06.496 --> 26:09.237
Now how can I resist
the charms of young love?

26:09.328 --> 26:10.318
Tell you what.

26:10.319 --> 26:12.839
Let's sit down, and we'll talk deal.

26:21.488 --> 26:23.988
What?

26:26.492 --> 26:27.906
Good news, guys.

26:27.907 --> 26:29.544
I had to butt heads
with my sales manager,

26:29.545 --> 26:33.354
but it turns out I am gonna be
able to offer you the newlywed rate.

26:33.447 --> 26:35.576
There's just one small problem.

26:35.577 --> 26:37.904
Another couple is interested in the car.

26:37.905 --> 26:40.131
You guys know Ken and Linda, right?

26:40.132 --> 26:42.632
We met them last night.

26:45.237 --> 26:48.139
Well, they arrived in Liberty
Village a few days before you did,

26:48.262 --> 26:50.762
and they're under evaluation as well.

26:50.846 --> 26:53.795
We're only gonna let one
couple join our family here.

26:53.889 --> 26:56.163
And this being America,

26:56.164 --> 26:59.305
we thought we'd decide things
with a good old-fashioned...

27:00.286 --> 27:02.553
competition.

27:02.554 --> 27:05.264
The winning couple gets
to move on in our program.

27:05.404 --> 27:08.115
Oh, and a brand-new convertible.

27:08.956 --> 27:11.456
While the losing couple...

27:12.311 --> 27:15.022
well, dies.

27:18.293 --> 27:22.704
Now, I should probably get on out
of the way before I get myself shot.

27:23.311 --> 27:26.882
Oh, and it looks like Lloyd
gave them a bit of a head start.

27:26.975 --> 27:29.735
Sorry about that. Good luck to you guys.

27:51.707 --> 27:54.207
Get down!

28:56.537 --> 28:59.037
Come on!

29:10.125 --> 29:12.625
It's dead.

29:13.341 --> 29:16.720
Well, protocol dictates we contact
A.P.O, let them know what's going on.

29:16.860 --> 29:18.927
We might have access to communications

29:18.928 --> 29:21.497
now that we've joined the
Liberty Village family.

29:21.589 --> 29:24.040
They tried to kill us over
a car. I mean if we stay,

29:24.041 --> 29:26.511
they might send us to the
supermarket and launch grenades at us.

29:26.512 --> 29:29.317
Well, we can't just leave.
This place is like a prison.

29:29.411 --> 29:32.171
Our best bet is still to maintain cover.

29:32.245 --> 29:33.759
Yeah, well, next time we
go on one of his tests,

29:33.760 --> 29:36.375
I'm bringing our gun. I
don't care what he says.

29:38.993 --> 29:41.493
Vaughn, come here.

29:48.054 --> 29:50.118
Is it bad?

29:50.119 --> 29:52.619
You've looked better.

30:24.636 --> 30:27.136
The story you told at the dealership...

30:28.585 --> 30:31.680
we were supposed to go to
Santa Barbara three years ago,

30:32.566 --> 30:35.066
and we never made it.

30:35.862 --> 30:38.362
Karen and Dave did.

30:44.345 --> 30:46.338
Well, I started by eliminating
the more obvious...

30:46.339 --> 30:49.433
sequence book codes, steganography,
invisible ink, maybe the watermark.

30:49.479 --> 30:51.039
But then I realized

30:51.040 --> 30:53.990
it was right in front of
my face the entire time.

30:54.084 --> 30:55.551
The inscription.

30:55.552 --> 30:57.186
Take a look. Right here.

30:57.187 --> 30:58.554
Ahem.

30:58.555 --> 31:04.608
"Laura, all my love,
forever and a day... Jack. "

31:04.888 --> 31:07.600
That's really sweet.

31:07.740 --> 31:10.833
I mean, that's a side of you I
really never get to see, Mr. Bristow.

31:10.925 --> 31:11.914
I have to...

31:11.915 --> 31:12.952
I have to say, I like it.

31:12.953 --> 31:14.325
I fail to see the relevance.

31:14.326 --> 31:15.411
Right. Sorry.

31:15.412 --> 31:16.637
So did the NSA.

31:16.638 --> 31:19.732
Anyway, I ran a chromatographic
analysis of the ink,

31:20.011 --> 31:22.413
and check this out.

31:22.414 --> 31:25.173
One of the periods in
the ellipses contains ink

31:25.219 --> 31:26.916
that was different than
the inscription itself.

31:26.917 --> 31:29.344
It was added after you wrote it.

31:29.345 --> 31:31.146
Irina encoded it with a microdot.

31:31.147 --> 31:34.000
So I magnified it with
a digital microscope,

31:34.374 --> 31:36.730
and... look at this...

31:36.731 --> 31:39.231
it's a protocol Irina used to
contact one of her operatives.

31:39.292 --> 31:41.665
Someone important,
given how detailed it is.

31:41.666 --> 31:43.418
Any idea who she was communicating with?

31:43.419 --> 31:44.878
Well...

31:44.879 --> 31:47.053
all that's there is a code name...

31:47.054 --> 31:48.841
Sentinel.

31:48.842 --> 31:51.000
Do we have copies of everything inside?

31:51.001 --> 31:55.001
Well, yeah, but you're
giving it to the russians?

31:55.562 --> 31:58.129
Sentinel's a deceased
operative. It's a dead end.

31:58.549 --> 32:02.358
The russians can have it. Our
priorities are Sydney and Vaughn.

32:24.146 --> 32:26.236
Good.

32:26.237 --> 32:28.737
You're awake.

32:28.860 --> 32:31.762
We need to get you packed.
We're going to America.

32:45.040 --> 32:47.540
The agreement was for all of the books.

32:48.072 --> 32:50.572
That's the one you're looking for.

32:53.157 --> 32:56.202
We haven't heard from
Irina in quite some time.

32:57.089 --> 32:59.945
She's a difficult
woman to keep track of.

33:00.410 --> 33:02.910
That she is.

33:03.751 --> 33:06.701
She always spoke quite favorably of you.

33:07.027 --> 33:12.985
Her attachment made her
work problematic at times.

33:13.873 --> 33:17.349
I hope I didn't cause you
too much inconvenience.

33:19.405 --> 33:22.594
I have an aircraft waiting
at the Jeznyev airstrip.

33:22.640 --> 33:25.494
A support team will provide
transport for your assets

33:25.588 --> 33:28.586
once they have left the
facility's perimeter.

33:30.128 --> 33:32.628
Goodbye, Jack.

33:33.342 --> 33:35.842
Alexei.

33:40.460 --> 33:42.834
1526 Glenbury Lane.

33:42.835 --> 33:46.596
3-bedroom, 2-bath, hardwood floors.
They've even got a breakfast nook.

33:46.689 --> 33:48.103
What, are we moving to Chicago?

33:48.104 --> 33:51.179
You're Chicago, they're Atlanta.
Dianne and I are New York.

33:51.272 --> 33:53.772
You have a meeting on
tuesday with Pierce Financial.

33:53.789 --> 33:55.779
We've prepared extensive
backgrounds for you.

33:55.780 --> 33:59.972
Human resources should flip out over
a young upstart couple like yourselves,

34:00.065 --> 34:02.009
provided you ace the
interview, of course.

34:02.010 --> 34:03.524
We're attacking an investment firm?

34:03.525 --> 34:06.025
We just need access to their servers.

34:06.591 --> 34:08.391
At some point in the near future,

34:08.393 --> 34:11.915
an unfortunate incident is going to
befall the New York stock exchange.

34:12.036 --> 34:13.360
If we have access to the servers

34:13.360 --> 34:16.074
of America's financial
institutions during that time,

34:16.259 --> 34:19.592
we'll be in prime position for a
massive redistribution of wealth.

34:19.684 --> 34:23.304
Think of it as, um, aggressive marxism.

34:24.518 --> 34:28.996
What's the casualty projection
for this unfortunate incident?

34:29.228 --> 34:31.728
Are the gladiators of
Liberty Village automotive

34:31.746 --> 34:34.246
having a sudden crisis of conscience?

34:34.266 --> 34:36.766
Civilian deaths mean repercussions.

34:37.063 --> 34:39.563
We'll need an exit strategy.

34:49.636 --> 34:51.150
That reminds me.

34:51.150 --> 34:52.188
We should go through the op-tech

34:52.190 --> 34:54.161
in case I have to reroute
you guys through New York.

34:54.163 --> 34:56.663
What do you know about
electromagnetic weapons?

35:24.504 --> 35:26.160
Mr. Sloane, the Tabakovs...

35:26.161 --> 35:28.108
the couple that Sydney and
Vaughn are impersonating?

35:28.109 --> 35:29.573
The germans just moved them.

35:29.574 --> 35:31.851
To a maximum security prison in Havel.

35:31.852 --> 35:34.611
The consulate informed me of
the transfer a few minutes ago.

35:34.658 --> 35:37.417
The consulate informed everybody
of the transfer a few minutes ago.

35:37.463 --> 35:39.055
They sent the order
over an unsecured line.

35:39.056 --> 35:41.815
If the October Contingent had
the Tabakovs' names flagged...

35:42.141 --> 35:43.655
Send the abort code.

35:43.656 --> 35:46.156
Get Sydney and Vaughn out of there now.

35:51.107 --> 35:53.722
Now, underneath you got
a secondary compartment

35:53.862 --> 35:57.098
with your meet protocol, documents.

35:57.238 --> 35:59.758
We even threw in the backgrounds
of all your new neighbors.

36:00.084 --> 36:02.584
Should help you make
small talk at barbecues.

36:02.651 --> 36:06.938
Disengage the fail-safe, lift
the cover, flip the switch.

36:07.078 --> 36:09.021
You don't wear a pacemaker, do you?

36:09.022 --> 36:11.522
I'm kidding.

36:13.011 --> 36:14.660
Hi, honey.

36:14.661 --> 36:17.277
Yeah, yeah. No, things
are right on schedule.

36:18.819 --> 36:21.031
Mm-hmm.

36:21.032 --> 36:24.316
Yes. Yes, no, they're very
excited about their breakfast nook.

36:29.869 --> 36:31.331
Okay.

36:31.332 --> 36:32.417
Yes.

36:32.418 --> 36:34.918
I'll be sure and tell them.

36:35.305 --> 36:37.805
I love you, too.

36:42.678 --> 36:44.766
That was Dianne. She said to pack warm.

36:44.767 --> 36:46.855
Chicago's cold this time of year.

36:46.856 --> 36:49.084
She gets a little
obsessed when we travel.

36:49.085 --> 36:49.960
You want some more coffee?

36:49.961 --> 36:51.565
I'd love some, thanks.

36:51.566 --> 36:56.236
Ha ha. Watch, I'm telling you, it's
amazing. It's just like clockwork.

36:56.283 --> 36:58.035
As soon as we'll be outside of Vologda,

36:58.036 --> 37:01.130
she'll think that we left the stove on.

37:09.498 --> 37:12.686
So we had to do our initial evaluation
at the Liberty Village fried chicken.

37:13.949 --> 37:16.803
I got burn marks all over
my back from the fry machine.

38:15.227 --> 38:16.452
They're on to us.

38:16.453 --> 38:18.953
Yeah, I figured that part out.

38:19.239 --> 38:21.739
I don't know what happened,
but we got to get out of here.

38:33.582 --> 38:34.618
Set it off!

38:34.619 --> 38:37.119
Set off the E.M.P.!

38:59.184 --> 39:01.684
Maybe it's time we
move out of the suburbs.

39:06.099 --> 39:07.929
Russian authorities officially deny

39:07.930 --> 39:11.023
an american training ground ever
existed within their borders.

39:11.676 --> 39:13.381
However, off the record,

39:13.382 --> 39:16.238
they have expressed
gratitude for our assistance

39:16.377 --> 39:18.992
in their takedown of
the October Contingent.

39:19.693 --> 39:23.311
We'll debrief in detail
upon your arrival.

39:23.590 --> 39:25.665
But for now...

39:25.666 --> 39:27.639
good work.

39:27.640 --> 39:28.578
Thank you.

39:28.579 --> 39:31.079
Thank you.

39:31.386 --> 39:33.740
So, Alexei made good on his promise.

39:33.741 --> 39:36.930
Which means our suspicions
regarding Sentinel are accurate.

39:37.911 --> 39:40.480
The russians are searching
for Elena Derevko.

39:40.573 --> 39:43.618
Yeah. We will have to
move up our timetable.

39:46.703 --> 39:48.113
It's strange,

39:48.114 --> 39:53.165
but I'm not exactly excited about
returning to America for some reason.

39:53.304 --> 39:56.016
Well, it was kind of nice not
to have to be us for a while.

39:58.868 --> 40:03.775
Well, I happen to like us,
even if we are a little cold.

40:03.869 --> 40:05.284
And boring. Don't forget boring.

40:05.285 --> 40:07.785
How could I?

40:09.407 --> 40:11.686
You know, we have operational
command of this aircraft.

40:11.687 --> 40:13.915
The pilot could take
us anywhere we want.

40:13.916 --> 40:16.416
Our orders are to proceed
with our extraction.

40:16.481 --> 40:19.480
If we were to divert this
aircraft for our personal use,

40:19.806 --> 40:21.637
we would get into a lot of trouble.

40:21.638 --> 40:24.138
Yes.

40:24.206 --> 40:25.948
Yeah.

40:25.949 --> 40:27.798
You want to have
dinner with me in Paris?

40:27.799 --> 40:30.299
Absolutely.

40:38.399 --> 40:38.400
