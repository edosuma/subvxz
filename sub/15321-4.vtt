WEBVTT

00:04.922 --> 00:06.913
Why drop the bag now,

00:06.924 --> 00:08.710
except to torture the Larsens?

00:08.718 --> 00:11.004
Some kind of sick game?

00:12.680 --> 00:15.092
Could be a sign of remorse.

00:15.808 --> 00:18.140
Tattoo boy was driving
Larsen's truck.

00:18.144 --> 00:19.509
He knew Rosie.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.896
They went biking together.

00:20.897 --> 00:23.639
Then he's helping
burn down Beau Soleil.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.901
Whoever he is,
he knows something.

00:25.902 --> 00:27.984
She didn't have
that much clothing.

00:27.987 --> 00:29.693
Wherever she was going,

00:29.697 --> 00:32.313
it wasn't for more
than a few days.

00:32.325 --> 00:35.032
I need to get this bag tested.

00:37.079 --> 00:39.991
I got this lab rat
from my narc days. He's solid.

00:39.999 --> 00:41.864
I'll drop it off to him
on the DL,

00:41.876 --> 00:43.537
stay off of Carlson's radar.

00:43.544 --> 00:46.081
What's this lab guy's name?

00:51.511 --> 00:54.799
Linden, I thought
the Richmond photo was legit.

00:56.516 --> 00:58.256
Okay?

01:00.186 --> 01:02.427
I mean, Gil saved my life.

01:03.022 --> 01:05.308
|-| had like 10 days
when I met him.

01:05.316 --> 01:07.102
l was at a point
I wasn't caring

01:07.109 --> 01:10.351
what I was putting in my skull,
up my nose, down my throat.

01:10.363 --> 01:11.603
I mean, H was
at rock bottom, and he...

01:11.614 --> 01:13.229
I don't care.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.736
We're in the middle
of a shit storm because of you.

01:23.292 --> 01:25.908
Guess I just trusted
the wrong guy.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.081
Yeah, I guess you did.

01:42.812 --> 01:45.224
That's not Stan's boys.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.435
They don't got the overalls.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.544
Any of them our guy?

02:14.635 --> 02:17.593
No. No tattoo.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.886
Yo, that's
Janek Kovarsky's joint.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.852
So Stan Larsen is back
with the mob?

02:32.278 --> 02:33.688
I wonder if he knows his trucks

02:33.696 --> 02:36.608
helped cover up
his daughter's murder.

03:42.181 --> 03:44.593
Larsen moving and storage.

03:45.017 --> 03:47.429
Yeah, this is him.
What do you want?

03:50.523 --> 03:53.640
What? Today?

03:56.028 --> 03:58.690
No, no, you're not
cremating him.

03:58.698 --> 04:01.610
Well, I'll come
pick him up, then.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.984
I said I'm coming to get him.

04:05.705 --> 04:08.538
Oh, God.

04:09.542 --> 04:11.578
What's wrong, dad?

04:11.961 --> 04:13.952
Hey, buddy.
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

04:13.963 --> 04:15.828
What's up?

04:17.425 --> 04:20.337
We need to get going, Tommy.

04:22.263 --> 04:25.755
Look, this may come
as a surprise to you,

04:25.766 --> 04:28.803
but your aunt Terry felt
the same way about school.

04:28.811 --> 04:30.472
It doesn't surprise me.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.640
Now, that's called sarcasm.

04:32.648 --> 04:35.310
Go to class, and you might find
out what that means someday.

04:35.317 --> 04:37.774
So giddyap.
Let's go.

04:39.739 --> 04:42.731
I'm gonna count to three, okay?

04:42.742 --> 04:46.234
One... Two...

04:46.245 --> 04:50.363
Get your shoes on
and get out of the house now.

04:54.170 --> 04:55.751
Larsen moving and storage.

04:57.089 --> 04:59.705
Don't bother.
I made other arrangements.

04:59.717 --> 05:03.209
Now the
cops want to send a car by.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.551
You believe that?

05:04.555 --> 05:06.466
Yeah.

05:06.474 --> 05:10.843
So, Tommy's been like this
for the past two days,

05:10.853 --> 05:12.343
not wanting to go to school.

05:12.354 --> 05:13.730
Something's going on with him.

05:13.731 --> 05:15.517
Well, I'll have to take care
of it later,

05:15.524 --> 05:18.516
'cause I got to go downtown
to the... morgue.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.233
It's about Belko?

05:20.237 --> 05:22.944
They want to put him in a box
and be done with him.

05:26.786 --> 05:28.447
I'll be down there in a minute.

05:28.454 --> 05:29.944
I thought
we were gonna be late.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.411
- Hey.
- Just go.

05:36.295 --> 05:38.206
Where's Belko?

05:38.214 --> 05:40.205
He was gonna take us
to the zoo yesterday.

05:40.216 --> 05:41.877
He's been sick.

05:41.884 --> 05:44.876
Just go on down. Your aunt Terry
will be right there.

05:48.307 --> 05:49.808
There are unconfirmed reports

05:49.809 --> 05:51.470
it was allegedly a front
Maybe you should tell them.

05:51.477 --> 05:54.514
For a prostitution ring
known as Beau Soleil.

05:54.522 --> 05:57.013
Police have also connected
the premium escort service

05:57.024 --> 06:00.357
to the murder of local
high-school teen Rosie Larsen.

06:00.361 --> 06:02.568
The blaze is still
under investigation,

06:02.571 --> 06:05.734
but the initial...
Cops are saying Rosie was connected

06:08.077 --> 06:10.819
Yeah, but they were wrong,
right?

06:12.081 --> 06:15.039
Look, I got to take the boys.

06:21.215 --> 06:24.127
Denny! Tommy!

06:25.386 --> 06:26.466
Guys?

06:27.346 --> 06:30.179
Help me! Help!

06:30.182 --> 06:32.013
Oh, my God. I'm coming. I'm coming.
I'm right here. Help!

06:32.017 --> 06:34.394
- I hate him! I hate him!
- Denny, are you okay?

06:34.395 --> 06:36.386
Oh, my God.
Come on.

06:36.397 --> 06:38.012
Come on. It's okay.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.598
I hate you, Tommy!
You suck!

06:40.609 --> 06:41.940
Tommy!

06:43.404 --> 06:45.190
What is wrong with you?

06:45.197 --> 06:47.438
Why would you do that
to your brother?

06:47.449 --> 06:48.985
Why would you do that
to your brother?

06:48.993 --> 06:50.904
Answer me!
Why would you do that?!

06:50.911 --> 06:53.027
Answer me, would you?!
Tommy, come on!

06:53.038 --> 06:55.154
Get off!

07:00.713 --> 07:02.624
You're not my mom!

07:03.048 --> 07:06.131
Why don't you just go home?!

07:06.760 --> 07:10.093
Go home! I hate you!

07:10.097 --> 07:13.055
Tommy! I'm 3...

07:27.615 --> 07:30.277
So, how do you know
this FBI guy?

07:30.951 --> 07:33.283
He's a mob expert.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.868
Organized crime?

07:34.872 --> 07:37.079
That's not exactly your beat.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.456
Linden.

07:40.461 --> 07:41.621
Cory.

07:42.296 --> 07:43.627
Thanks for seeing us.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.462
Of course, of course.

07:45.466 --> 07:48.458
This is my partner,
Detective Holder.

07:48.469 --> 07:51.256
You the big mob expert?
For real?

07:52.014 --> 07:53.925
Can I have the picture, please?

07:56.226 --> 07:58.603
Our victim was with this guy.

07:58.604 --> 07:59.935
Had this tat.

07:59.939 --> 08:02.271
Suspected arson linked
to Janek Kovarsky.

08:02.274 --> 08:03.935
Yeah, arson's a Janek special.

08:03.943 --> 08:05.308
He mixes some lighter fluid.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.059
It's next to impossible
to trace.

08:07.071 --> 08:09.062
I don't recognize the tat,
though.

08:09.073 --> 08:10.233
Could be a runner, new kid.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.027
Janek's pulling them
off the street 24/7.

08:13.035 --> 08:15.526
I hear Stan Larsen used
to work for Kovarsky, too.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.573
Has a body on him
from back in the day?

08:17.581 --> 08:19.412
Yeah, early '90s.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.953
Janek was just small time then.

08:21.961 --> 08:23.997
He was running a card game

08:24.004 --> 08:26.996
out of the back
of his Polish restaurant.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.168
Janek was trying
to expand his operation

08:29.176 --> 08:32.543
into prostitution,
protection, city contracting.

08:32.554 --> 08:33.714
Then he found out
this other kid

08:33.722 --> 08:36.213
was skimming off
his collections.

08:36.225 --> 08:37.886
Piotr Michaelski?

08:37.893 --> 08:39.303
Is that the guy Stan whacked?

08:39.311 --> 08:40.721
Well, we could never prove it,

08:40.729 --> 08:42.594
but word was that
that was the price

08:42.606 --> 08:44.187
Larsen had to pay to get out.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.728
This Michaelski kid...
he have any family?

08:46.735 --> 08:49.602
Yeah, his wife,
Monica, found him.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.655
Hands bound,
in the trunk of his car?

08:53.659 --> 08:56.617
Single shot to the head.

09:27.443 --> 09:29.058
Hey, there.

09:31.488 --> 09:34.480
I'm Josh, your OT.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.982
"O" for "occupational,"
"T" for "therapist."

09:36.994 --> 09:39.326
I'm here to teach you
basic self—care...

09:39.329 --> 09:41.456
Brushing your teeth,
combing your hair,

09:41.457 --> 09:43.914
bathing, taking care
of bodily functions.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.294
They write that little speech
for you

09:46.295 --> 09:48.286
or you just come up with it
all on your own?

09:48.297 --> 09:49.628
Pardon me?

09:49.631 --> 09:51.713
I've felt more empathy
at the DMV.

09:51.717 --> 09:53.082
Why don't you come back

09:53.093 --> 09:57.336
after you've...
worked on your delivery?

10:13.113 --> 10:14.319
Holder.

10:14.323 --> 10:16.109
Your badge.

10:21.997 --> 10:25.785
Monica? Seattle PD.
We need a word.

10:30.881 --> 10:33.543
None of you gave a shit
17 years ago

10:33.550 --> 10:36.792
when Stan Larsen put a bullet
in Piotr's head.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.965
Why you coming now?

10:38.972 --> 10:40.303
We're investigating the murder

10:40.307 --> 10:43.390
of his daughter, Rosie Larsen.

10:44.812 --> 10:48.475
Can't say I'll lose
any sleep over that.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.473
Might rest better, even,

10:50.484 --> 10:52.816
knowing there's some justice
in this world.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.482
Yeah, life's funny
like that sometimes.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.980
I can think
of another word for it.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.606
And yet here you are,
counting our nut dishes,

10:59.618 --> 11:01.279
while the guy who iced
your boyfriend

11:01.286 --> 11:03.242
is just living
the good life, huh?

11:03.914 --> 11:06.280
You people saying I did it?

11:06.291 --> 11:08.077
Don't you got nothing
better to do?

11:08.085 --> 11:10.872
Does Piotr have any family?

11:11.505 --> 11:15.248
His ma died young.
He was an only child.

11:15.717 --> 11:18.379
Piotr got bounced around some,
around the neighborhood,

11:18.387 --> 11:19.843
met up with Janek.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.634
You people should have
arrested Stan.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.222
He used Piotr,

11:24.226 --> 11:28.845
killed him, stuck him
in a trunk like he was trash.

11:35.237 --> 11:38.570
So, we got the nut collector
playing bingo till 1:00 am.

11:38.574 --> 11:41.566
I mean, no way that
menthol-smoking bag of bones

11:41.577 --> 11:44.239
drags her sorry ass out
in those woods after Rosie.

11:44.246 --> 11:46.362
Do you think?

11:49.960 --> 11:53.293
- Mmm.
- Is that bacon?

11:53.297 --> 11:54.628
Nah.

11:54.631 --> 11:59.125
This is ham...
eggs, and sausage.

11:59.136 --> 12:03.049
What happened to your whole
lacto-ovo-vegan thing?

12:03.056 --> 12:06.514
Nothing. I'm just ready
to embrace meat again.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.433
Hmm.

12:09.980 --> 12:13.188
Cory said Kovarsky was involved
in city contracting.

12:13.192 --> 12:14.898
Might give us a link
to the mayor.

12:15.152 --> 12:16.938
We should just call the mayor.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.693
I mean,
if Cory's got that hookup,

12:18.697 --> 12:21.234
we could ask him
who shot JFK, too.

12:21.617 --> 12:24.984
Maybe Rosie's BFF
knows about tattoo boy.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.826
I mean, Sterling said
that there was some old man

12:26.830 --> 12:28.286
in Rosie's life.

12:28.624 --> 12:30.831
Wasn't a teacher.

12:31.168 --> 12:33.830
Hmm, some street thug
working for Janek Kovarsky...

12:33.837 --> 12:35.213
That's got to be the last person

12:35.214 --> 12:37.000
Stan wants her
to be seeing.

12:37.007 --> 12:38.338
Linden.

12:38.342 --> 12:39.673
Is this Sarah Linden?

12:39.676 --> 12:41.507
Yes.
Brian McCarthy.

12:41.511 --> 12:44.548
I represent Gregory Casher,
Jack Linden 's father.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.592
Is it true that you're planning
to move your son

12:46.600 --> 12:48.807
to another state
without informing him?

12:48.810 --> 12:51.392
I don't have to tell him
or you anything. What is this?

12:51.396 --> 12:53.057
I am calling to let you know

12:53.065 --> 12:54.976
my client is suing
for joint custody.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.391
On what basis?

12:57.402 --> 12:59.393
Your continued
and consistent neglect

12:59.404 --> 13:03.067
and failure to meet your
child's basic needs as a parent.

13:03.575 --> 13:06.066
Do you have representation,
miss Linden?

13:06.078 --> 13:09.366
If not, I suggest you ﬁnd it.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.850
You said Rosie was seeing
someone in secret.

13:35.857 --> 13:38.940
Maybe. I mean,
I don't know for sure.

13:39.778 --> 13:41.109
You ever see this?

13:44.574 --> 13:46.030
Uh, yeah.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.525
This guy was hanging
outside Rosie's house,

13:48.537 --> 13:50.118
like, staring at her.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.074
He had that.

13:52.416 --> 13:54.498
Do you remember
what he looked like?

13:55.836 --> 13:57.747
Tall, skinny, fat?

13:59.673 --> 14:01.459
And, like, maybe 18?

14:01.466 --> 14:03.752
He was in a truck, so I didn't
really see him that well.

14:04.136 --> 14:06.252
I didn't pay
any attention to it.

14:06.263 --> 14:08.094
Guys were always
trying to talk to Rosie.

14:08.098 --> 14:10.089
What was he doing
outside of Rosie's house?

14:10.100 --> 14:11.306
I don't know.

14:11.310 --> 14:13.221
She talked to him
for like a second,

14:13.228 --> 14:15.059
told him to get lost.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.564
When was this?

14:16.565 --> 14:19.602
Like, the end of school
last year.

14:20.652 --> 14:21.687
Did you see him again?

14:21.695 --> 14:23.185
No.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.357
He really creeped Rosie out.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.445
Why?

14:26.450 --> 14:28.486
I think she said
he'd been in prison

14:28.493 --> 14:30.029
or something.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.612
What else
did she say about him?

14:33.623 --> 14:35.614
Nothing.
I mean, that's it.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.241
She wasn't really saying stuff

14:38.253 --> 14:41.416
to me at that point, so...

14:41.423 --> 14:44.836
Well, if you think
of anything else...

14:45.427 --> 14:47.713
How's Mrs. Larsen?

14:52.392 --> 14:54.474
Tell her I said hi, okay?

14:56.021 --> 14:57.181
Thanks, Sterling.

15:14.289 --> 15:14.698
Hello?

15:14.706 --> 15:17.413
Hey. It's me.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.078
I need your help.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.997
Is that your version
of an apology?

15:21.922 --> 15:23.662
Can we just meet somewhere?

15:24.925 --> 15:26.961
If you want to meet
in DC, sure.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.086
You don't waste any time.

15:30.097 --> 15:32.588
So... what,
you just take a staff job?

15:32.599 --> 15:34.965
- I'm headed into a meeting, Jamie.
— Right.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.555
The doctors need some info

15:37.562 --> 15:39.939
to help him recover quicker.

15:39.940 --> 15:43.148
God forbid the campaign come
to an end while he heals.

15:43.151 --> 15:46.018
Hey, you left, all right?
His sister's a no-show.

15:46.029 --> 15:48.270
This isn't about the campaign.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.776
You have 30 seconds.

15:51.410 --> 15:53.867
The doctors gave me
a questionnaire to ﬁll out.

15:55.372 --> 15:58.910
What's a typical morning like
for Darren...

15:59.793 --> 16:02.409
You know, waking up?

16:02.421 --> 16:03.911
Are you serious?

16:03.922 --> 16:06.914
I wouldn't ask if I didn't
need it, all right?

16:06.925 --> 16:08.631
This is supposed to help him
get on his feet,

16:08.635 --> 16:10.967
metaphorically speaking.

16:10.971 --> 16:13.428
Anything you can give me
would really help.

16:14.433 --> 16:16.890
What side
does he usually sleep on?

16:19.396 --> 16:22.513
Whatever side I'm facing,
he faces the other way.

16:22.524 --> 16:25.857
Okay, that's great.
No preference.

16:25.861 --> 16:27.647
What's next?

16:30.866 --> 16:31.696
He sets the alarm

16:31.700 --> 16:34.487
for half an hour
before he wakes up.

16:35.412 --> 16:36.276
Okay.

16:36.288 --> 16:37.994
And then when he
finally does get up,

16:37.998 --> 16:42.287
he bangs around,
opening drawers and...

16:42.294 --> 16:44.410
looking for things.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.011
Looking for things

16:52.012 --> 16:55.630
like his... keys and...

16:57.225 --> 17:02.015
sung/asses...
his watch.

17:03.440 --> 17:07.479
You know what?
I'll figure it out.

17:07.903 --> 17:09.439
Thanks.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.071
Darren doesn't care about
the little things in life,

17:13.074 --> 17:14.200
like daily routines.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.112
That stuff won't get him
out of bed.

17:17.162 --> 17:18.948
What will?

17:19.915 --> 17:22.577
Being Darren Richmond again.

17:23.502 --> 17:25.788
I got to go.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.941
Picking up Jack's dinner?

17:50.862 --> 17:53.979
The warden approved this visit.
What's the holdup?

17:55.700 --> 17:57.986
Hey, wake up, man.

17:58.537 --> 18:01.199
Benissimo Lee.
We got it approved.

18:01.206 --> 18:03.413
All right, hold on a second.

18:11.383 --> 18:13.169
Linden, let's go.

18:17.305 --> 18:18.636
So, warden says
you're giving out

18:18.640 --> 18:21.723
most of the tattoos
in juvie hall, Benissimo.

18:21.726 --> 18:24.103
How you figure, Columbo?

18:25.730 --> 18:29.473
Look, we don't care what you do
in your rec time.

18:32.404 --> 18:35.111
We're just wondering
if this is your work.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.232
Ogi Jun.

18:38.243 --> 18:42.862
Yeah, he a B. Lee special.
So what?

18:42.872 --> 18:45.659
Who'd you do this for?

18:47.502 --> 18:49.163
Giffs.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.001
Giffs?

18:51.006 --> 18:52.962
What, we got to give you another
zagnut to get his name?

18:52.966 --> 18:54.831
Don't know his real name.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.501
Giffs was in the family unit.

18:57.512 --> 18:59.468
He's a foster kid?

19:05.020 --> 19:07.807
Hey. I snuck some goodies
by the nurses.

19:08.648 --> 19:12.357
Cream puff? Don't worry.
The filling's all liquid.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.319
Look, l-l, um... I got this
questionnaire from the guy.

19:16.323 --> 19:17.779
Jamie, Jamie, I need some air.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.489
I got to get out
of here... now.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.037
Put me in the chair.

19:26.583 --> 19:29.290
Yeah, absolutely. Let me, uh...
let me just call the guy.

19:29.294 --> 19:32.377
No, screw that.
Right... right now.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.587
Um, okay.

19:34.591 --> 19:37.173
- Uh, you and me?
- Yeah.

19:38.720 --> 19:42.008
Okay, yeah.
Yeah, we... we can do this.

19:42.015 --> 19:44.006
It's like the Cadillac
of wheelchairs.

19:44.017 --> 19:47.100
Practically wheels itself.
Your sister sent it.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.101
I could have told you
Elyse would send money

19:49.105 --> 19:50.311
before she'd get on a plane.

19:50.315 --> 19:51.646
Okay, um...

19:52.484 --> 19:54.850
Uh, we got to...
we got to put you on me.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.102
You have to take me
under the shoul...

19:57.113 --> 19:57.818
Shoulders.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.323
- l...
- Right, right.

19:59.324 --> 20:00.780
Yeah, and then
get me on your...

20:00.784 --> 20:01.864
- On my chest.
- Okay.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.826
All right, one, two, three.

20:05.330 --> 20:06.365
Oh!

20:06.373 --> 20:08.489
- Come on.
- I'm trying.

20:08.500 --> 20:09.956
You're like twice my weight,

20:09.959 --> 20:13.167
so just try to relax.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.963
I'm the definition of relaxed.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.220
Okay.

20:22.097 --> 20:23.587
We could do this.

20:23.598 --> 20:24.508
We can do this.

20:24.516 --> 20:27.804
One, two, three.

20:27.811 --> 20:29.722
Ugh.
Oh, God. This is good.

20:29.729 --> 20:30.935
This is good.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.100
- No.
- No, no, no, no.

20:33.108 --> 20:34.143
This is not good.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.686
- Lift. Lift. Lift me up.
- This is not good.

20:35.694 --> 20:37.150
Lift me up. I'm trying!
I'm trying!

20:37.153 --> 20:39.018
Get me back on my bed.
You're... you're crushing me.

20:43.827 --> 20:47.319
Are you okay?
Darren?

20:51.000 --> 20:54.959
Alexi Giffords, AKA Gifts...
he's our tattoo boy.

20:54.963 --> 20:58.956
This is the DMV photo.
20 years old, Caucasian male.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.332
He's a foster kid.

21:00.343 --> 21:02.584
He spent 18 months in juvie
after bolting from a home

21:02.595 --> 21:03.584
when he was 16.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.585
Kid's a runner...

21:04.597 --> 21:06.553
He's been in 5 homes
in 10 years.

21:07.392 --> 21:09.053
That's two years in each home.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.926
Yes.

21:11.730 --> 21:14.392
You catch a bad one,
two years is a lifetime.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.225
Is this his juvenile record?

21:18.236 --> 21:19.442
Yeah.

21:19.446 --> 21:22.108
It's mostly petty stuff
till he hooks up with Janek.

21:22.115 --> 21:25.357
Then we got him robbing,
stealing, shaking down,

21:25.368 --> 21:27.199
just like Stan back in the day.

21:27.203 --> 21:29.580
Janek knows how to raise them.

21:30.498 --> 21:31.658
Check out the address.

21:31.666 --> 21:33.202
224 Hanson Road.
So what?

21:33.209 --> 21:36.042
That's three blocks
from the Larsens'.

22:10.371 --> 22:12.077
Help you?

22:12.832 --> 22:14.743
Uh, yeah.

22:14.751 --> 22:18.243
Um... I'm here
for Belko Royce.

22:19.297 --> 22:22.289
It's a family burial.
Paperwork's all there.

22:23.593 --> 22:25.333
The funeral home picked him up.

22:25.345 --> 22:26.209
What?

22:26.221 --> 22:29.338
See?
It's all been taken care of.

22:56.751 --> 22:58.833
Saved you a seat.

23:00.839 --> 23:03.296
Poor, dumb son of a bitch.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.332
Belko never had
what you've got, Stan.

23:06.928 --> 23:09.135
Like my own boy,
Andre...

23:09.138 --> 23:12.847
No discipline
to take over the business.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.555
It should have been you, Stan.

23:16.563 --> 23:18.679
You wanted something different.

23:18.690 --> 23:20.931
I'm good with what I got.

23:22.235 --> 23:24.442
How's that working for you?

23:24.779 --> 23:26.360
Your daughter dies.

23:26.364 --> 23:28.229
Who pays to bury her,

23:29.659 --> 23:32.150
protect your boys?

23:33.162 --> 23:35.778
I appreciate all you've done
for my family,

23:35.790 --> 23:38.327
- but I will not...
- They put you in prison.

23:38.334 --> 23:39.949
And Rosie's killer...

23:40.712 --> 23:43.169
He's still out there.

23:43.798 --> 23:47.541
Give me your tired,
your huddled masses...

23:48.136 --> 23:50.502
You bought that gowno.

23:50.513 --> 23:53.255
Poor man's never gonna sit
at their table.

23:53.266 --> 23:57.350
When the heat turns up,
we settle the score.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.436
Like Belko did?

24:02.191 --> 24:04.978
Like he died doing?

24:05.361 --> 24:08.023
Least he went out like a man.

24:14.245 --> 24:16.076
I got to go,

24:16.080 --> 24:18.241
figure out dinner for the boys.

24:18.249 --> 24:19.864
Speaking of,

24:19.876 --> 24:22.788
one of my guys saw your boy
Tommy at school...

24:23.504 --> 24:25.415
Kids beating on him,

24:25.840 --> 24:28.547
teasing him about his sister.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.129
Thought you should know.

24:37.727 --> 24:39.467
How was school?

24:39.479 --> 24:42.312
Yeah? That's great.

24:42.941 --> 24:45.603
He's good.
I'm with him right now.

24:46.569 --> 24:48.730
Okay, I'll tell him.

24:49.197 --> 24:51.654
Listen, Jack, I got to go.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.649
Okay, bye.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.322
There's four units,

24:57.330 --> 24:59.491
no names on the mailboxes,
nobody home.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.615
Let's go hit up the DCS
for his foster file,

25:01.626 --> 25:03.207
see if he's got any relatives.

25:03.211 --> 25:06.203
No, you can't.
Foster records are sealed.

25:06.214 --> 25:09.672
Only way we could get a look
is if Alexi lets us.

25:14.514 --> 25:16.971
Yo, I got to piss.

25:24.107 --> 25:27.440
So, Rosie likes bad boys
like her father.

25:27.443 --> 25:30.606
I don't buy that she knew
about Stan's past.

25:30.613 --> 25:32.444
There's no way
that he told her.

25:32.448 --> 25:33.904
It's in the DNA...

25:34.534 --> 25:36.650
You know, the sins of the father
and all that.

25:36.661 --> 25:38.572
Did you read that
in 0 Magazine?

25:42.667 --> 25:45.784
Mean, Alexi could have
taken off for Alaska by now.

25:48.589 --> 25:50.250
He's not a runner.

25:50.258 --> 25:52.089
Two years in each home?

25:52.093 --> 25:53.924
That's plenty of time
to figure out

25:53.928 --> 25:56.340
how, when, and where
you're gonna bolt.

25:57.265 --> 25:59.221
So what is he?

26:00.601 --> 26:02.216
A planner.

26:29.297 --> 26:30.537
This isn't how either of us

26:30.548 --> 26:32.880
imagined this ending, Darren.

26:32.884 --> 26:35.500
Funny how life
can turn on a dime.

26:40.308 --> 26:42.014
I'm not gonna waste
my time or yours

26:42.018 --> 26:43.724
feeling sorry for you.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.435
You will come back from this.

26:46.439 --> 26:49.351
When you do,
it'll only add to your appeal.

26:50.318 --> 26:52.354
And I want you to know...

26:53.863 --> 26:56.570
from the bottom of my heart...

26:56.574 --> 26:58.940
I'm gonna be pulling for you.

26:59.869 --> 27:01.279
My offer still stands.

27:01.287 --> 27:04.404
Four years from now,
you got my full support.

27:04.791 --> 27:07.498
Won't that just ease
your conscience?

27:09.462 --> 27:11.248
I've been wondering.

27:11.923 --> 27:15.632
What made the police so certain
I killed that girl?

27:16.677 --> 27:18.884
They won't tell me.

27:19.597 --> 27:21.804
But I will find out.

27:25.728 --> 27:28.140
Offer still stands, Darren.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.472
You got a lot of nerve
coming here.

27:31.484 --> 27:33.099
No need to be rude, Jamie.

27:33.111 --> 27:34.942
I'm just leaving.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.273
You ran a solid campaign, son.

27:41.285 --> 27:44.072
Gwen landed on her feet.
I'm sure you will, too.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.420
So what's up with you
and that fed?

27:55.633 --> 27:59.751
You and that Tom Waits wannabe
ever hook up or what?

28:01.347 --> 28:05.386
Oh, snap.
Linden rocked a booty call.

28:07.812 --> 28:10.554
Dial 1-900-Linden.

28:11.649 --> 28:14.186
That's not even enough numbers.

28:20.616 --> 28:23.278
That's pretty slick,
Linden...

28:24.036 --> 28:25.992
That candy-bar move
in juvie.

28:26.539 --> 28:28.780
They trade them in there.
It's like money.

28:29.333 --> 28:31.540
Did seem familiar.

28:32.295 --> 28:35.583
It was my first job I worked
out of the academy.

28:35.590 --> 28:37.922
That right?

28:37.925 --> 28:39.881
Yeah.

28:42.930 --> 28:44.921
I thought you said you were
a runner, back in the day,

28:44.932 --> 28:46.638
when you were
in that foster home.

28:46.642 --> 28:50.100
I didn't say that. Yeah, you did.
You said you bolted every six months.

28:52.148 --> 28:53.809
Well, makes sense,

28:53.816 --> 28:57.024
you know, with Sonoma
and everything.

28:58.821 --> 29:00.812
What? I'm just
making conversation

29:00.823 --> 29:03.735
since we're wasting
our time here anyway.

29:12.001 --> 29:14.913
You're right. This is
a waste of time. Get out.

29:16.339 --> 29:19.297
Come on, Linden.

29:20.885 --> 29:22.500
For real?

29:28.059 --> 29:29.515
What am I supposed
to do out here?

29:29.518 --> 29:30.382
Your job.

29:30.394 --> 29:32.885
Call in for a car and keep
your eyes open for Alexi.

29:32.897 --> 29:35.559
Hey, come on.
Yeah, all right.

29:37.401 --> 29:39.483
Least we're back to normal.

29:59.090 --> 30:00.626
Tommy.

30:00.633 --> 30:02.498
Tommy!

30:10.142 --> 30:11.348
What are you doing here?

30:11.352 --> 30:13.308
l was driving by.
How's it going?

30:17.149 --> 30:21.358
Those boys...
They saying stuff about Rosie?

30:28.619 --> 30:31.076
Hey. Come here

30:33.040 --> 30:36.373
those kids...
They're stupid, you hear?

30:37.336 --> 30:39.577
They don't know
what they're saying.

30:39.588 --> 30:41.419
You hear me?

30:42.091 --> 30:43.126
Good.

30:43.134 --> 30:46.217
Now, next time one of them picks
on you, what are you gonna do?

30:46.220 --> 30:47.721
I'm gonna walk away.

30:47.722 --> 30:49.462
No.

30:52.143 --> 30:55.226
I want you to hit him.

30:55.229 --> 30:57.060
The only way they'll learn.

30:57.064 --> 31:02.479
You pick the biggest guy,
and hit him hard.

31:03.321 --> 31:06.859
You aim for the bridge
of the nose, okay?

31:06.866 --> 31:08.857
You hear me?

31:34.060 --> 31:36.301
Hello?

31:37.396 --> 31:39.512
Who is this?

31:44.278 --> 31:45.814
Who is it?

31:45.821 --> 31:48.073
It's a wrong number.

31:49.950 --> 31:52.327
Jasper, come on.
Dinner's ready.

31:52.328 --> 31:53.784
Hey, check this out.

31:53.788 --> 31:56.029
l was going through fan mail.

31:56.040 --> 31:58.247
Found this...

31:59.126 --> 32:02.789
"Get well" card
from George Washington Carver.

32:03.339 --> 32:05.625
That's the elementary school
in Pigeon Point.

32:06.717 --> 32:09.049
Mrs. Cheever's
fourth-grade class.

32:09.053 --> 32:11.715
God, I can't believe
that old bag is still teaching.

32:11.722 --> 32:15.965
She looked like a mummy
when l was there.

32:15.976 --> 32:18.103
Didn't we use her class
to stuff envelopes

32:18.104 --> 32:19.935
for subsidized housing
backin'02?

32:19.939 --> 32:22.271
I know what you're doing.
It won't work.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.105
What am I doing?

32:24.110 --> 32:25.725
I want you
to draft a statement.

32:25.736 --> 32:27.601
I'm withdrawing from the race.

32:30.282 --> 32:31.943
Yesterday, you said
you wanted to...

32:31.951 --> 32:34.613
I don't care what I said.
Just do it.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.111
Okay.

32:37.123 --> 32:38.988
Let's talk about the speech.

32:38.999 --> 32:40.990
Statement. You'll be reading it.
Whatever.

32:41.001 --> 32:43.333
| just want to be clear
on what I'm telling them.

32:43.337 --> 32:46.044
I know that Councilman Richmond
told you he'd fight for you,

32:46.048 --> 32:48.539
make sure old Lesley Adams
didn't get four more years

32:48.551 --> 32:51.384
of free and clear access
up your collective asses.

32:51.387 --> 32:54.220
But guess what, folks...
The councilman lied.

32:54.223 --> 32:56.555
Save the eloquence
for your next candidate.

32:56.559 --> 32:58.891
Screw you.

32:58.894 --> 33:01.385
That's right.
Let it out.

33:01.397 --> 33:03.729
Let's hear what really
goes on up there.

33:05.985 --> 33:08.067
Do you know how many people
believe in you...

33:08.070 --> 33:09.901
depend on you?

33:09.905 --> 33:12.738
l have spent the last 10 years
of my life

33:12.741 --> 33:14.242
living out of my car,

33:14.243 --> 33:17.576
working 24/7, fighting for you.

33:17.580 --> 33:20.367
So put it on your résumé
and get out.

33:25.463 --> 33:27.374
You're a coward.

33:27.381 --> 33:28.496
You're fired.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.338
You can't fire me
if you're not running.

33:30.342 --> 33:33.175
Get a life, Jamie.
I'm not it.

33:33.179 --> 33:35.170
Hey, I'm doing you a favor.

33:35.181 --> 33:37.092
Go on, go out,
get laid for a change.

33:37.099 --> 33:39.385
Call Gwen.
I hear she's available.

33:40.102 --> 33:42.309
You son of a bitch.

34:00.206 --> 34:04.324
So, where is home
these days, Sarah?

34:04.335 --> 34:05.996
I'm covered.

34:06.003 --> 34:07.664
Uh, didn't answer the question.

34:07.671 --> 34:09.332
I said I'm good, Regi.

34:09.340 --> 34:11.331
You realize we've been having
this conversation

34:11.342 --> 34:13.833
practically since you
could speak.

34:13.844 --> 34:16.460
I'm nothing if not consistent.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.719
And how is Jack
taking all this?

34:21.727 --> 34:23.058
He's fine.

34:23.062 --> 34:24.268
And how about you?

34:24.271 --> 34:28.765
Are you remembering to do
things like eat and sleep?

34:28.776 --> 34:31.392
Regi, I'm here on business.

34:33.948 --> 34:35.609
Okay, then.

34:35.616 --> 34:37.948
I need the file
on an ex-foster kid.

34:37.952 --> 34:41.160
His name's Alexi Giffords.

34:41.163 --> 34:42.664
Not gonna happen.
Sorry.

34:42.665 --> 34:44.121
He's 20.
He's an adult.

34:44.124 --> 34:46.115
It doesn't matter.

34:46.126 --> 34:48.287
Come on, Sarah.

34:49.922 --> 34:52.538
How would you like somebody
poking around in your file?

34:54.385 --> 34:57.092
If it solved a murder,
I'd be fine with it.

36:16.383 --> 36:18.248
Stan.

36:26.894 --> 36:28.725
What's this?

36:28.729 --> 36:30.469
You tell me.

36:30.481 --> 36:33.143
You said it was a dead end,

36:33.150 --> 36:36.017
that it had nothing to do
with Rosie.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.818
I cleaned out Beau Soleil.
So what?

36:48.499 --> 36:49.909
What do you do to her?

36:49.917 --> 36:51.327
What do you do to Rosie?!

36:51.335 --> 36:53.075
You believe this guy?

36:53.087 --> 36:55.294
After 17 years, he comes here,

36:55.714 --> 36:57.579
asks for money,
for my protection.

36:57.591 --> 37:00.253
And I give it,
and what do | get?

37:00.260 --> 37:01.340
Accusations.

37:01.345 --> 37:03.427
What did you do to Rosie?

37:03.430 --> 37:06.763
l were you, I'd forget
this business with Rosie.

37:06.767 --> 37:10.601
It's making you forget
who's important in your life,

37:11.313 --> 37:14.180
like the children
you still have.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.337
This is Detective Holder,
badge number 4592.

38:24.344 --> 38:26.084
I'm calling in a 320.

38:26.096 --> 38:29.008
All units, request to locate
a Caucasian male, early 20s,

38:29.016 --> 38:30.972
wearing a brown sweater,
blue jeans,

38:30.976 --> 38:32.591
heading north on Hudson.

38:52.122 --> 38:54.613
You Regi's friend?

38:58.712 --> 39:00.122
Any trouble finding the place?

39:00.130 --> 39:02.086
No.
I'm familiar with it.

39:05.135 --> 39:06.875
They changed the color
of the balloons.

39:06.887 --> 39:08.218
They used to be red.

39:08.222 --> 39:11.430
They should give them to
the kids who don't get adopted.

39:14.603 --> 39:16.639
Do you have Alexi's file?

39:22.236 --> 39:24.352
He came to me when he was 4.

39:24.363 --> 39:26.354
He was a sweet boy.

39:26.365 --> 39:29.402
He was one of the ones
I thought was gonna make it.

39:32.871 --> 39:35.328
Mom abandoned him on the steps
of a church.

39:35.332 --> 39:36.572
Teenage mom, unstable.

39:36.583 --> 39:39.416
Apartment four.
Alexi Giffords.

39:39.419 --> 39:42.252
Alexi was in and out
of foster homes.

39:42.256 --> 39:45.919
He was adopted by the Giffords
family when he was 13.

39:46.760 --> 39:49.046
Stayed with them
till he was 16.

39:49.054 --> 39:52.137
The situation imploded,
and he ran away.

39:56.812 --> 39:59.804
The system caught him,
threw him in juvenile hall.

39:59.815 --> 40:03.307
And that's around the time
that I lost track of him.

40:03.318 --> 40:05.570
What about
his biological father?

40:06.530 --> 40:08.395
Dad was killed
when Alexi was little,

40:08.407 --> 40:11.319
around the time
that his mom gave him up.

40:13.787 --> 40:16.153
So he wasn't born
Alexi Giffords.

40:16.164 --> 40:18.246
- That's his adoptive name.
- That's right.

40:18.250 --> 40:19.956
And what about his birth name?

40:20.335 --> 40:22.872
- Michaelski.
- What?

40:23.213 --> 40:26.455
His birth mother
is Monica Krol.

40:26.884 --> 40:28.249
His father's listed as...

40:28.260 --> 40:31.593
Piotr Michaelski.

41:42.167 --> 41:44.374
You know who I am?

41:47.589 --> 41:51.377
You got what you deserved.
