WEBVTT

00:02.411 --> 00:03.744
(sirens wailing)

00:03.896 --> 00:05.153
- Okay.
(sighs)

00:05.172 --> 00:06.913
All right, the lawyer said
to meet him

00:07.066 --> 00:09.416
at Courtroom 3, right?

00:09.844 --> 00:14.571
Okay, um, this is Courtroom 3.

00:15.090 --> 00:17.424
Are we in the wrong place,
or is he late?

00:18.352 --> 00:20.019
Ten minutes is kind
of late, right?

00:20.170 --> 00:21.520
- You notice everyone seems
to have a dad here?

00:21.671 --> 00:23.263
- Okay, you don't know
that they're dads.

00:23.415 --> 00:24.506
Moms can protect kids, too.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.525
All right? That's not
just a man's job.

00:26.602 --> 00:27.860
(indistinct chatter)

00:28.011 --> 00:29.028
- Sorry.

00:29.104 --> 00:30.270
Sorry, I'm just scared, okay?

00:30.364 --> 00:32.089
I know I messed up.
- It's okay.

00:32.107 --> 00:35.576
We're gonna fix it.
It's my fault that you're here.

00:39.856 --> 00:41.498
Where's that lawyer?

00:43.769 --> 00:46.462
(tense intriguing music)

00:49.050 --> 00:52.033
(birds chirping)

00:52.053 --> 00:55.387
(panting)

01:01.303 --> 01:04.621
(grunting)

01:04.623 --> 01:06.881
- Please, not again.

01:07.459 --> 01:10.903
- So, the MRI showed some
micro-scale injuries,

01:10.979 --> 01:12.220
little tiny tears.

01:12.298 --> 01:14.073
And this is your second
ACL injury,

01:14.224 --> 01:15.649
which is why we did
the blood test.

01:15.725 --> 01:18.577
You have a mutation in the
collagen type 1 alpha 1 gene,

01:18.728 --> 01:20.412
which means you don't make as
much collagen as everyone else.

01:20.564 --> 01:22.897
- Please don't tell me I have
to quit cross-country.

01:22.917 --> 01:25.084
- I'm sorry to say that running
might not be for you.

01:25.235 --> 01:26.919
- But... it's how I get
my energy out!

01:27.146 --> 01:29.496
And I have a lot
of extra energy.

01:29.924 --> 01:31.739
- You'll have to find
another way.

01:32.409 --> 01:34.576
And this'll heal,
it just takes time.

01:34.653 --> 01:35.836
Okay?

01:35.988 --> 01:37.763
I'll renew your PT prescription.

01:37.914 --> 01:39.431
- Thank you.

01:40.267 --> 01:43.251
(door opens and closes)

01:43.329 --> 01:47.164
- So I'm officially a mutant.

01:47.166 --> 01:49.166
Did my father have this
collagen thing?

01:49.184 --> 01:52.169
- Oh, I don't know,
because sperm banks didn't have

01:52.171 --> 01:54.113
that type of information
back then.

01:54.264 --> 01:57.765
And he wasn't your father, okay?
He was an anonymous donor.

01:57.843 --> 01:59.526
- What if I have hemophilia?

01:59.678 --> 02:01.453
Like what if...
what if he's a Romanov!

02:01.605 --> 02:03.029
(chuckles)

02:03.182 --> 02:05.457
- You don't have hemophilia,
honey, and he wasn't a Romanov.

02:05.609 --> 02:07.626
- No. You don't know that!
You don't know anything!

02:07.777 --> 02:09.628
I don't know why you would
do something so reckless

02:09.705 --> 02:11.421
with my life!

02:12.299 --> 02:14.633
(door opens)

02:16.303 --> 02:18.028
- We turned in our essays
a week ago

02:18.030 --> 02:19.713
and she hasn't even
read them yet.

02:20.366 --> 02:21.548
- What is it about your
teacher's feedback

02:21.700 --> 02:22.641
that you need right away?

02:22.868 --> 02:25.051
- Everything!
It determines our grades.

02:25.128 --> 02:27.053
- It sounds like you're
impatient to know that grade.

02:27.130 --> 02:29.222
- No, you just want
Ms. Parker to praise you.

02:29.299 --> 02:30.983
"Excellent word choice, Will."

02:31.134 --> 02:32.634
- That's not true.
I just think...

02:32.711 --> 02:34.878
(elevator dings)
...we turned them in on time,

02:34.897 --> 02:36.155
she should read them.

02:36.231 --> 02:37.714
- If you feel good about
the work you did,

02:37.733 --> 02:38.899
why do you need her validation?

02:39.067 --> 02:41.051
- Can you just stop being
a shrink for a minute

02:41.053 --> 02:42.494
and just be my mom?

02:43.906 --> 02:45.497
- Do you have to hold the door?

02:46.316 --> 02:48.292
- Can you just try to be civil?

02:48.985 --> 02:50.335
- Oh, come on!

02:50.412 --> 02:52.412
Help me grab that.
- I got it.

02:52.489 --> 02:55.065
(whispers): Why does Jessie's
mom bug you so much?

02:55.083 --> 02:58.068
You used to be friends.
- Don't remind me.

02:58.086 --> 03:01.405
- What'd the doctor say?
- That I'm defective.

03:01.407 --> 03:03.998
But we already knew that.
- Uh, nobody is defective

03:04.076 --> 03:08.078
and um... Will, thank you
for helping us.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.080
- Yeah.
(Kara): You're very sweet.

03:10.098 --> 03:12.933
I'm sorry.
(Dominic): Oh, please.

03:13.009 --> 03:14.526
- Okay.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.478
Thanks.

03:17.031 --> 03:18.846
Hey, Fern.
- Hi.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.440
- Hey.
(button clicks)

03:20.868 --> 03:23.535
(elevator doors closes)

03:24.279 --> 03:26.187
- Uh, what'd you get
for dinner?

03:26.207 --> 03:27.931
- The good dumplings...
- Ah.

03:27.950 --> 03:29.357
- ...from that place
around the corner.

03:29.435 --> 03:31.268
We're gonna play a game after,
where you have to

03:31.286 --> 03:33.103
make up the first line
of a book,

03:33.121 --> 03:34.862
and then everyone guesses
which one is the real one.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.090
- It's exactly as uncool
as it sounds.

03:37.167 --> 03:38.942
(Jessie chuckles)
Wanna come play?

03:38.961 --> 03:41.403
- Fern, I'm sure they're busy.

03:41.405 --> 03:44.539
- Yeah, yeah. I've got a lot
of homework to do.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.475
(elevator dings)

03:49.063 --> 03:50.971
What time is my next
PT appointment?

03:50.973 --> 03:52.289
- Thursday after school.

03:52.307 --> 03:55.609
It was really nice
of Will to help us out.

03:57.145 --> 03:59.053
Is there anything
between you two?

03:59.073 --> 04:02.649
- What? No! Mom!
I've known him my whole life.

04:02.726 --> 04:04.076
I would never think
of him that way.

04:04.227 --> 04:07.729
- You just described the plot
to every John Hughes film.

04:07.806 --> 04:08.705
- Who's John Hughes?

04:10.659 --> 04:11.825
(Kara sighs)

04:11.977 --> 04:13.401
- I'm not...

04:14.162 --> 04:17.089
...not to be over-protective.
- But you are.

04:17.165 --> 04:18.665
- It's just...

04:19.409 --> 04:23.262
Honey, I had boyfriends
too young, and I regret it.

04:23.413 --> 04:27.007
And you and Will have such
a nice friendship.

04:27.159 --> 04:28.583
It would be a mistake
to risk that.

04:28.660 --> 04:30.660
- I'm not! I don't know
why you think I am!

04:30.679 --> 04:33.087
- Because I see the way
that he looks at you.

04:33.165 --> 04:35.315
- Oh, stop.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.193
Ew.

04:44.860 --> 04:46.510
- Jessie?

04:46.512 --> 04:48.120
- Um...

04:48.196 --> 04:50.514
one... one second.

04:51.199 --> 04:53.625
- Can I come in?
- One second, please.

04:53.702 --> 04:55.127
Just one...
(door opens)

04:55.278 --> 04:57.754
- I thought you might
wanna ice...

05:00.968 --> 05:02.551
Is that a DNA kit?

05:03.119 --> 05:05.679
- Um... maybe.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.549
- Okay.

05:10.460 --> 05:13.219
- I... I just wanted
to know more.

05:13.296 --> 05:15.705
I thought maybe, you know, um,

05:15.724 --> 05:19.276
the donor took one
and registered to be contacted.

05:23.215 --> 05:27.326
- What... is your dream
outcome with this?

05:27.402 --> 05:31.555
- Well, um, I guess
if he did register,

05:31.557 --> 05:34.741
that would mean he was okay
with being found,

05:34.893 --> 05:37.077
and maybe I could meet him,

05:37.229 --> 05:38.670
and maybe I have a whole family
somewhere.

05:38.822 --> 05:42.248
- You know they wouldn't really
be your family, right?

05:42.401 --> 05:44.843
- Why do you assume they would
just reject me?

05:44.920 --> 05:46.903
- No. No, no, honey. No.

05:46.905 --> 05:49.556
I... I don't think that.

05:50.242 --> 05:52.500
You're wonderful.

05:52.519 --> 05:53.727
I just...

05:54.855 --> 05:56.429
I just wish...

05:57.340 --> 05:58.932
...that I were enough
for you.

05:59.008 --> 06:01.101
- Mom, don't!
- I know, I know,

06:01.253 --> 06:02.361
I'm supposed to be
the grown up here

06:02.512 --> 06:04.938
and not show my feelings,
I just...

06:05.090 --> 06:08.850
Oh, God. It is hard.

06:08.927 --> 06:12.687
- I'm not trying
to hurt you. I...

06:13.540 --> 06:17.267
I just wish I knew something
about the other half of me.

06:17.285 --> 06:18.710
- Okay.

06:20.772 --> 06:22.297
Why don't we...

06:23.942 --> 06:26.276
...go to the source.

06:26.278 --> 06:28.128
I'll call the cryobank,

06:28.280 --> 06:31.223
see what they can tell me
about the donor.

06:31.450 --> 06:33.633
Maybe they know more now
than they knew then.

06:33.785 --> 06:34.876
- Really?

06:34.953 --> 06:36.136
- Yeah.

06:36.288 --> 06:38.546
Oh God.
- Thank you!

06:38.974 --> 06:42.192
(breathing deeply)

06:43.295 --> 06:45.529
- Sorry. I thought
this would fit.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.313
Did you take the test?

06:47.466 --> 06:50.057
- Yep, and now I'm about
to throw it away.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.726
- No! Why?

06:52.246 --> 06:54.413
- 'Cause I can't hurt my mom.

06:54.489 --> 06:55.972
- Yeah, but it's just medical
information.

06:55.974 --> 06:57.140
Why shouldn't you know it?

06:57.159 --> 06:59.233
- Because she came in while
I was doing it,

06:59.311 --> 07:00.310
and you should've seen her face.

07:00.312 --> 07:02.904
Like... parents having feelings,

07:02.923 --> 07:04.998
it's so... messy.

07:05.150 --> 07:06.316
- But still.

07:06.318 --> 07:08.151
- No. No, you don't understand

07:08.153 --> 07:10.077
because you have
the perfect family.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.988
- They're not perfect!

07:11.990 --> 07:13.581
I mean, my dad represents
criminals,

07:13.659 --> 07:17.084
and my mom treats me
like I'm one of her patients.

07:17.162 --> 07:19.438
And you know, Fern actually
needs a shrink.

07:19.514 --> 07:21.181
My mom could write a whole
textbook about her.

07:21.333 --> 07:24.501
- Hm, well, maybe she can
write one about us next.

07:25.446 --> 07:27.946
Do you know how hard it was
to get all this spit out?

07:28.173 --> 07:30.240
(chuckling)

07:31.768 --> 07:33.743
(sighs)

07:36.031 --> 07:37.664
Bye, Dad.

07:39.367 --> 07:40.517
(indistinct chatter)

07:40.777 --> 07:44.129
- Honey, there's something
that I need to tell you

07:44.280 --> 07:45.464
before the lawyer gets here.

07:45.540 --> 07:47.524
- I still don't understand
what he's gonna say.

07:47.542 --> 07:48.783
I mean, I did it.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.878
- Okay, that's what I wanna
talk to you about.

07:52.030 --> 07:53.029
- Kara.
- I...

07:53.048 --> 07:54.455
- Jessie.

07:55.124 --> 07:57.291
I want to represent Jessie.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.886
I figured out a great defence.

07:59.963 --> 08:01.721
- We... we have a defence.

08:01.798 --> 08:02.889
- Has Jessie signed off on it?

08:03.041 --> 08:05.225
- We were...
- Signed off on what?

08:05.301 --> 08:07.043
- ...just about
to talk about it.

08:07.045 --> 08:08.570
- May I?

08:09.397 --> 08:10.489
(Dominic clears throat)

08:10.824 --> 08:13.883
Jessie really matters to Will,
and he feels responsible.

08:13.885 --> 08:15.160
He wants me to help.

08:15.311 --> 08:18.145
- You don't have to do this.
We have a lawyer.

08:18.223 --> 08:20.240
- Yeah. Uh, I know him,

08:20.316 --> 08:23.001
and I'm way better.

08:23.152 --> 08:25.061
Let me help you.
I'll do it for free.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.339
- No, I'm fine.
I can afford it.

08:27.415 --> 08:29.424
- Wait, no, no, no.
It's my decision.

08:30.736 --> 08:31.901
How bad is he?

08:31.903 --> 08:33.403
- Honestly?

08:33.421 --> 08:35.972
I wouldn't let him defend me
for a parking ticket.

08:39.761 --> 08:42.020
(tense intriguing music)

08:55.610 --> 08:56.593
(door opens)

08:56.595 --> 08:57.518
(heavy exhale)

08:57.520 --> 08:58.870
- Hi. Oh.

08:59.022 --> 08:59.946
- Hi.

09:00.599 --> 09:03.583
- You're doing your exercises.
That's good.

09:05.103 --> 09:06.694
Um...
(sighs)

09:07.122 --> 09:09.606
...can I talk to you
for a minute?

09:09.624 --> 09:10.940
- What's up?

09:10.959 --> 09:12.275
- Well,

09:12.294 --> 09:14.886
I called the cryobank today.

09:14.963 --> 09:16.596
- And?

09:17.540 --> 09:19.432
- I have some bad news.

09:20.877 --> 09:22.018
The donor died.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.791
- Died?

09:27.793 --> 09:28.958
- It wasn't anything genetic.

09:28.977 --> 09:30.960
It was a car accident,
years ago.

09:31.054 --> 09:32.145
I'm so sorry.

09:32.297 --> 09:34.981
- "Current occupation:
Library assistant

09:35.133 --> 09:38.651
and swimming instructor."
This is him?

09:38.728 --> 09:39.727
- He was in college.

09:39.821 --> 09:41.580
Those are college jobs.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.918
- He joked about
his excellent teeth.

09:47.070 --> 09:48.161
Why haven't you shown me this?

09:48.313 --> 09:52.165
- I-I must've seen it years ago
and lost it,

09:52.317 --> 09:54.150
and they just sent me
another copy.

09:54.169 --> 09:55.501
- Do you know his name?

09:55.654 --> 09:58.597
Was there a news story
about his accident?

09:58.748 --> 10:00.223
- No. I mean,

10:00.934 --> 10:02.249
not that I know of, no.

10:02.327 --> 10:05.845
- His older brother
was a competitive skier.

10:05.922 --> 10:07.439
Do you know his name?

10:07.590 --> 10:10.642
- No. No, I...
I just wanted you.

10:10.794 --> 10:14.779
The expectation was that
we would never know each other,

10:14.856 --> 10:16.022
never know who the other
one was.

10:16.099 --> 10:17.532
- And now I'll never know him!

10:18.768 --> 10:19.859
- Jessie, please.

10:20.011 --> 10:21.177
- I just need a minute, okay?

10:21.179 --> 10:22.846
With my dead father.

10:22.864 --> 10:24.030
- Oh, God.

10:24.182 --> 10:25.415
(door slams)

10:31.798 --> 10:34.448
(light pop music playing)

10:34.468 --> 10:37.118
- Apparently,
he wore blue sweaters

10:37.195 --> 10:39.763
to both of his sperm
bank interviews.

10:42.033 --> 10:44.367
Why does that make
my heart hurt?

10:44.386 --> 10:47.704
Why couldn't I have just
had a dad, like everyone else?

10:47.706 --> 10:49.389
- Not everyone.

10:49.465 --> 10:52.692
I mean, there's like six kids
in our grade with two moms.

10:55.304 --> 10:58.139
- It's like I found him
and lost him on the same day.

10:58.216 --> 10:59.306
Like, why would
she do that to me?

10:59.326 --> 11:02.218
- I mean, if she hadn't used
a sperm donor

11:02.237 --> 11:04.070
then you wouldn't exist.

11:04.890 --> 11:08.041
And the world would be way less
interesting without you in it.

11:09.503 --> 11:13.396
- You don't have to like,
try and make me feel better.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.675
- I'm not.
I... I mean it.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.472
- I was just really hoping
he was out there somewhere.

11:23.684 --> 11:24.683
And he's not.

11:24.759 --> 11:27.001
(exhales)
- Yeah.

11:27.095 --> 11:29.562
(light pop music continues)

11:31.917 --> 11:33.024
- Thank you.
(door opens)

11:33.176 --> 11:35.176
- Hey guys? I... oh.

11:35.195 --> 11:39.088
- Um, I was just, uh, sorry,
she was... she was feeling sad.

11:39.090 --> 11:40.273
- Oh. Yeah.

11:40.425 --> 11:44.093
Um, dinner's ready.
So...

11:44.112 --> 11:46.520
- Can Will stay for dinner?
- I...

11:46.598 --> 11:49.523
- Fern's at orchestra rehearsal
and my mom's working late.

11:49.543 --> 11:52.618
But it's fine if you don't
have enough.

11:52.771 --> 11:54.454
- Of course we do. I...

11:54.530 --> 11:58.508
why don't you two set the table
and I'll be right back.

11:59.627 --> 12:01.261
(knocking)

12:04.132 --> 12:06.132
- Hey.
- Hi. Um...

12:06.226 --> 12:07.392
Jessie invited Will for dinner.

12:07.543 --> 12:10.044
Is that okay?
- That's great, actually.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.229
- Oh. Good.

12:11.306 --> 12:13.047
- Andrea's out,
and I'm working on a brief

12:13.066 --> 12:15.141
and eatin' potato chips.
(chuckles)

12:15.218 --> 12:18.361
- Could I come in for a minute?

12:19.055 --> 12:20.964
- Uh, yeah.

12:20.982 --> 12:22.315
- Thank you.

12:22.467 --> 12:23.299
Thanks.

12:23.301 --> 12:27.078
I... Listen, I wanted to talk,

12:27.155 --> 12:30.807
because I know Jessie
acts so confident,

12:30.825 --> 12:32.375
but she's...

12:33.495 --> 12:36.237
...young for her age
and kind of fragile.

12:36.331 --> 12:38.314
(chuckles)
Fragile? Jessie?

12:38.316 --> 12:41.651
- I'm just worried that
her longing for a dad

12:41.653 --> 12:45.913
is gonna make her jump into
a romance prematurely.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.658
And I can see that Will
really likes her.

12:48.660 --> 12:51.770
- Don't worry, he knows
all about asking for consent

12:51.846 --> 12:53.271
to do anything.
- But still, I...

12:53.422 --> 12:57.108
- I mean, I was 14 the first
time I made out with someone.

12:57.185 --> 12:58.109
You probably were too.

12:58.261 --> 12:59.593
- Uh, younger, actually.

12:59.613 --> 13:01.262
But I don't think
that's a good thing.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.431
My parents weren't paying
attention to anything.

13:04.509 --> 13:07.434
- I don't know how to put this,
but I doubt you have to worry

13:07.454 --> 13:10.163
about Jessie being
under-protected.

13:10.940 --> 13:11.939
- Right.

13:12.017 --> 13:13.182
- Listen, thanks for
feeding Will.

13:13.184 --> 13:14.534
- Yeah. Uh, sure.

13:14.686 --> 13:16.686
- I'm up to my eyeballs.
(Dominic clears throat)

13:16.688 --> 13:17.962
- Yeah. Um, right.

13:18.114 --> 13:19.780
Thank you.
- Yeah.

13:19.858 --> 13:21.299
Okay.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.712
(phone ringing)

13:26.865 --> 13:27.864
- Reproductive Strategies.

13:27.866 --> 13:31.625
- Uh, hi!
Uh, this is Kara Harrison,

13:31.645 --> 13:32.977
we spoke yesterday.

13:33.129 --> 13:35.204
Um, I was so shocked

13:35.206 --> 13:38.483
<i> to hear the sperm donor I used</i>
<i> in 2008 had died.</i>

13:38.634 --> 13:40.652
And now I was wondering
if you had any information

13:40.803 --> 13:42.136
about his family?

13:42.305 --> 13:46.232
Because my teenager took one
of those at-home DNA tests,

13:46.309 --> 13:49.327
so she might end up tracking
them down.

13:49.478 --> 13:53.056
I... I completely understand
if they don't want to meet her.

13:53.058 --> 13:55.725
But, um, if they did
want to meet,

13:55.743 --> 13:58.336
I think my daughter would
really love that.

13:58.413 --> 14:01.230
- I'm sorry,
who did you speak to?

14:01.249 --> 14:04.600
- Uh, I... I don't remember.
Someone there.

14:04.602 --> 14:07.253
- And what kind of information
were you looking for?

14:07.330 --> 14:09.589
- A name? A last known address?

14:09.665 --> 14:11.424
- Oh, I couldn't give you
anything like that,

14:11.576 --> 14:12.183
even if I had it.

14:12.410 --> 14:14.093
- Okay, well, someone there

14:14.170 --> 14:17.747
told me my donor had died,
so I'm just following up.

14:17.749 --> 14:20.249
- I'm sorry, I don't know
who told you that,

14:20.251 --> 14:21.751
but I really can't help you.
(phone ringing)

14:21.769 --> 14:23.695
<i> - Wait, but I...</i>
- I hope your daughter finds

14:23.771 --> 14:24.863
what she's looking for.

14:25.256 --> 14:27.014
- Okay, thank you.

14:27.092 --> 14:28.925
<i> - Have a nice day.</i>

14:28.943 --> 14:31.202
- That woman was lying.
Why?

14:31.429 --> 14:35.248
I mean, she gave this to my mom.

14:36.601 --> 14:39.118
Someone on a thread about
donor-conceived kids

14:39.195 --> 14:41.880
said all the companies
just lost their records

14:42.031 --> 14:43.606
after a bunch of lawsuits.

14:44.533 --> 14:47.719
- Well, just look up the company
name and lawsuits.

14:47.870 --> 14:50.463
(washer buzzes)

14:51.040 --> 14:53.391
- Will you do it?
It makes me too nervous.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.378
(typing)

14:57.397 --> 15:00.139
- "Woman alleges that sperm bank
negligence

15:00.216 --> 15:01.900
caused genetic disorder."

15:02.051 --> 15:03.459
- What?

15:03.478 --> 15:06.312
- "Sperm donor, felon, claimed
to have master's degree."

15:06.389 --> 15:08.981
I mean, why not just say
that he had a PhD?

15:09.134 --> 15:10.816
- Maybe one of those guys
was my dad!

15:10.969 --> 15:12.318
- That seems unlikely.

15:12.470 --> 15:16.489
I mean, even if it was, your
mom bought this vial, right?

15:16.565 --> 15:18.808
But most of your genes could
have still come from her.

15:18.826 --> 15:19.976
It's a total grab bag,

15:19.994 --> 15:21.327
what actually ends up
in your genotype.

15:21.479 --> 15:24.497
- But these guys are in the mix.
They're a possibility.

15:25.650 --> 15:28.742
I need to find out what year
those happened.

15:28.762 --> 15:31.220
(knocking)

15:32.323 --> 15:34.081
- Hi. Is Jessie here?

15:34.100 --> 15:36.175
- No. Will said he was studying
with her.

15:36.327 --> 15:38.252
- I called her phone.
It went straight to voicemail,

15:38.271 --> 15:40.254
and then I tried to track
it and it said this address

15:40.331 --> 15:42.106
was her last location,
but she's not here.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.666
- Okay. I'll try Will's.

15:43.759 --> 15:45.184
- Thank you.

15:45.670 --> 15:46.852
(phone ringing tone)

15:46.929 --> 15:48.529
(sighs)

15:56.864 --> 15:58.531
(Jessie): Hi.

15:58.683 --> 15:59.624
- Hi.

16:00.034 --> 16:01.751
Will, wake up.

16:03.021 --> 16:04.629
(breathing deeply)

16:04.706 --> 16:05.946
- What time is it?

16:05.966 --> 16:08.691
- You cannot just disappear
like that!

16:08.693 --> 16:11.043
You scared me to death!
- We fell asleep studying!

16:11.196 --> 16:13.362
- In the laundry room?
In the dark?

16:13.364 --> 16:14.530
- The lights are on a timer!

16:14.532 --> 16:16.365
And it was the only place
that was quiet,

16:16.367 --> 16:17.976
cause Fern was playing
her stupid oboe.

16:18.127 --> 16:20.311
- I was not!
And they know I wasn't!

16:20.388 --> 16:22.205
- All right, listen,
they were just studying.

16:22.223 --> 16:24.482
Let's get some sleep and we can
talk about it tomorrow.

16:24.633 --> 16:25.725
- No, I, I...

16:26.302 --> 16:30.637
Will is to have no more
contact with Jessie!

16:30.657 --> 16:32.215
- Um, hi, sorry.

16:32.217 --> 16:34.141
Have any of you seen
Romeo and Juliet?

16:34.160 --> 16:36.402
- I'm serious!
- Mom, he's my friend!

16:36.554 --> 16:38.904
We weren't having sex on
the washing machines!

16:39.057 --> 16:41.499
(yelling): No more contact!

16:46.748 --> 16:48.297
I...

16:50.493 --> 16:53.011
I would like you to please
respect my wishes

16:53.162 --> 16:54.012
as Jessie's mom.

16:54.163 --> 16:55.471
(clears throat)

16:56.924 --> 16:58.558
Let's go.

17:07.009 --> 17:08.401
- Hm.

17:12.106 --> 17:14.106
- Will! Wait!

17:14.259 --> 17:17.035
- My parents are super
freaked out.

17:17.111 --> 17:19.186
I'm not supposed to be near you.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.396
- My mom overreacts.
You know that.

17:21.398 --> 17:22.782
- Yeah, that's what
they're afraid of.

17:22.934 --> 17:25.101
- Listen! I have a plan

17:25.194 --> 17:27.295
and I need your help tonight.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.438
- What kind of plan?

17:29.624 --> 17:33.426
- A really good one!
And it needs your help!

17:34.054 --> 17:35.702
(thrilling music)

17:35.780 --> 17:37.263
Hm?

17:38.800 --> 17:39.799
- Okay.

17:39.951 --> 17:41.967
(chuckles): Trust me.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.062
(clinic secretary):
There's always demand.

17:44.213 --> 17:45.930
Yes, even more so lately.

17:46.474 --> 17:50.293
I think people are just
rethinking their priorities.

17:50.886 --> 17:52.236
Yes, you can just come in.

17:52.463 --> 17:54.555
We're really grateful
for your interest.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.890
I can send you the application.
Thank you so much.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.993
Okay. Bye.

17:59.728 --> 18:01.245
- Hi! I...

18:01.397 --> 18:04.231
I would like to, um, donate.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.460
- Okay... how old are you?

18:07.921 --> 18:09.069
- Eighteen.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.980
- Eighteen.

18:11.073 --> 18:12.815
Can I see some ID?

18:12.834 --> 18:13.816
- Yeah.

18:13.818 --> 18:16.677
(♪♪)

18:17.655 --> 18:19.155
Oh!

18:19.157 --> 18:20.656
I forgot my wallet.

18:20.658 --> 18:21.915
- Right.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.659
I appreciate your interest

18:23.752 --> 18:25.252
but there are less complicated
ways to make money.

18:25.330 --> 18:27.847
I promise.
- No, I-I...

18:27.923 --> 18:29.832
I really just want
to help people.

18:29.851 --> 18:32.593
- Okay. Uh, tell you what then,

18:32.612 --> 18:36.005
you come back when you're older
and we'll get it all started.

18:36.023 --> 18:38.357
Okay? I gotta close up now.
- Okay.

18:38.434 --> 18:42.120
Um, all right, can I just get
one of those brochures?

18:42.271 --> 18:43.863
- Sure.
- So I can plan.

18:44.015 --> 18:44.956
- You bet.

18:45.183 --> 18:47.667
(thrilling music continues)

18:48.944 --> 18:51.420
Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.464
- Psst.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.468
- It's really serious in there.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.680
- Okay, so?

19:04.202 --> 19:05.959
Will! I love you.

19:06.554 --> 19:09.372
- But she might have noticed.
They could change the codes.

19:09.390 --> 19:10.556
I just...

19:10.708 --> 19:12.817
I don't... I don't know
if this is a good idea.

19:12.894 --> 19:13.893
(sighs)
(door beeps)

19:14.045 --> 19:15.153
- I'm just leaving now.

19:15.229 --> 19:17.262
I'll be home in half an hour.
- That's her.

19:17.340 --> 19:19.064
- You don't have to go in
if you don't want to.

19:19.141 --> 19:20.825
I could go in alone.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.885
(car starting)
- No.

19:22.887 --> 19:24.620
No, I'm in.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.583
- Okay. Let's go.

19:31.062 --> 19:32.503
(door beeps)

19:36.617 --> 19:37.675
- Over here.

19:37.752 --> 19:39.552
(door beeps)

19:44.592 --> 19:46.684
(door beeps)

19:46.761 --> 19:49.437
(suspenseful music)

19:54.101 --> 19:56.009
(door beeps)

19:56.029 --> 19:58.362
(machines humming)

20:01.075 --> 20:03.259
- That's where my dad lived.

20:03.277 --> 20:06.162
With all the other frosty
little swimmers.

20:06.764 --> 20:08.021
Oh, computer.

20:08.115 --> 20:10.449
They've got to catalogue
all the donations, right?

20:10.526 --> 20:13.436
So, uh, I just gotta hope their
records go back far enough.

20:13.438 --> 20:16.105
- Well, I'm guessing
it's not "password."

20:16.123 --> 20:17.623
- Let's see.
(beeps)

20:17.775 --> 20:19.550
Nope.
"Sperm123"?

20:19.702 --> 20:25.014
- My mom keeps hers on a tiny
sticky note inside of her desk.

20:30.212 --> 20:33.356
- That's a terrible place
to keep a password.

20:34.141 --> 20:35.882
Ah! No way.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.810
It was meant to be! Okay, um...

20:37.962 --> 20:42.889
file number 387bx.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.483
(beeps)

20:44.635 --> 20:45.818
Nothing.

20:45.970 --> 20:48.412
- Uh, maybe your mom's name?

20:51.567 --> 20:52.708
(beeps)

20:53.920 --> 20:55.494
- Nothing.

20:55.997 --> 20:57.313
- Um, did she have
a maiden name?

20:57.331 --> 21:01.300
- Obviously not.
And ew, "maiden." Um...

21:02.336 --> 21:05.263
You try. What am I not
thinking of?

21:09.994 --> 21:11.752
- They have porn on here.

21:11.829 --> 21:12.937
I guess it's for the donors.

21:13.088 --> 21:14.163
They have a whole folder
called "Nurses."

21:14.165 --> 21:16.023
- Oh my god, close that!

21:17.777 --> 21:20.111
- Here's 2004 to 2007.

21:20.838 --> 21:23.672
But none of these file numbers

21:23.674 --> 21:25.283
even match the format
of your mom's.

21:25.434 --> 21:27.118
Like, these don't even
have letters in them.

21:27.269 --> 21:28.577
- Can you open one?

21:30.031 --> 21:32.623
(soft music)

21:35.186 --> 21:37.411
- Okay um, do you...
do you think that

21:38.372 --> 21:41.132
maybe your mom just made
this profile

21:41.208 --> 21:43.500
to have something to show you?
- No.

21:44.211 --> 21:45.878
- Because the cryobank
didn't have anything

21:46.030 --> 21:48.121
and you needed to see something.
- No!

21:48.199 --> 21:49.807
- I mean, just like think
about it for a minute.

21:49.884 --> 21:51.216
- No, no! Stop! Stop it!

21:51.369 --> 21:53.627
This place lies to people!
- What are you doing?

21:53.646 --> 21:57.565
- Jessie, stop! No, don't
touch that! It's too cold.

21:59.134 --> 22:00.735
- It ruins their lives.

22:02.063 --> 22:03.612
- Jessie, don't...
don't do this.

22:05.399 --> 22:06.640
- Hello, sir.

22:07.051 --> 22:09.976
May you never have a child who
has no idea who her father is.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.554
- No, Jessie, don't.
(Jessie sobs)

22:11.556 --> 22:17.651
This could be a guy having
cancer treatment, or who died!

22:17.670 --> 22:19.837
This could be someone's last
chance at having their kid!

22:19.988 --> 22:22.381
(sniffles)

22:27.738 --> 22:29.972
(heavy exhale)

22:33.260 --> 22:35.561
(broken whisper): I just wanted
to find him.

22:40.918 --> 22:42.526
- I know.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.029
- He's not here.

22:47.683 --> 22:48.741
- He isn't.

22:51.262 --> 22:53.019
- Thanks for coming with me.

22:53.097 --> 22:55.581
It was really brave of you.

22:57.243 --> 22:59.377
- I'm only brave with you.

22:59.954 --> 23:03.422
(soft music)

23:07.128 --> 23:10.446
(music fading)

23:10.464 --> 23:13.265
There's a silent alarm.
We have to go!

23:14.877 --> 23:18.437
(tense music)

23:20.400 --> 23:22.474
- Ah! Oh, my knee.

23:22.627 --> 23:23.651
- You okay?

23:24.795 --> 23:27.738
(ominous music)

23:28.891 --> 23:30.408
Come on.

23:40.161 --> 23:41.919
- I'm turning myself in.
You have to run.

23:41.996 --> 23:43.754
I'll never make it with my knee.

23:43.906 --> 23:44.980
- No, I'm not leaving you.

23:44.999 --> 23:46.373
- Please go.
I got you into this.

23:46.408 --> 23:48.467
There's no point in both
of us getting in trouble.

23:50.004 --> 23:52.680
Go! Run!

24:02.166 --> 24:04.758
(indistinct radio communication)

24:04.777 --> 24:06.335
I'm here.

24:06.337 --> 24:08.487
(car door closes)
I give up.

24:13.511 --> 24:14.118
(door buzzes)

24:14.269 --> 24:16.345
- What were you thinking?

24:16.347 --> 24:18.956
Breaking and entering?
That is a felony!

24:19.107 --> 24:20.124
- You made me do it!

24:20.275 --> 24:22.943
- I made you break
into a sperm bank?

24:22.962 --> 24:24.778
- You made that profile!

24:24.797 --> 24:25.963
(door buzzing outside)

24:26.114 --> 24:27.690
(Kara sighs)

24:27.692 --> 24:28.466
I knew it.

24:28.617 --> 24:30.209
- I made it.

24:30.285 --> 24:32.861
I made it because I needed
to show you something.

24:32.863 --> 24:37.641
You'd become so fixated on
finding out who the donor was.

24:37.793 --> 24:38.809
- So it was all made up?

24:38.961 --> 24:41.270
- No. No. I...

24:45.467 --> 24:48.319
I tried to remember
what I could.

24:48.896 --> 24:50.279
I just...

24:51.398 --> 24:54.216
I wanted to give you
something tangible

24:54.218 --> 24:55.884
so that you could move on.

24:55.978 --> 24:57.328
- So you lied to me.

24:57.404 --> 25:00.272
And not some... some casual,
spontaneous lie.

25:00.424 --> 25:02.658
You practically wrote
an entire novel.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.577
The blue sweaters?

25:05.671 --> 25:06.820
The skiing brother?

25:06.839 --> 25:08.297
- It was wrong.

25:08.991 --> 25:10.966
- Is he even dead?

25:12.253 --> 25:13.677
Please tell me the truth.

25:13.829 --> 25:15.921
I don't know how to believe
anything you're saying!

25:15.998 --> 25:17.406
(door buzzes)

25:17.424 --> 25:19.241
- Once you sign her out,
you can go,

25:19.334 --> 25:21.977
and you'll get a notice
to appear in court.

25:24.265 --> 25:27.399
- I made up the part
about him being dead.

25:28.769 --> 25:30.528
I'm sorry.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.698
Let's go home.

25:36.944 --> 25:38.685
(birds chirping)

25:38.763 --> 25:40.037
- Hi! Hi.

25:41.098 --> 25:42.022
- Kara. Hi.

25:42.099 --> 25:44.116
- Um, do you have a minute?

25:44.192 --> 25:47.027
- Uh, a minute, yeah.
I mean, I have to go to work.

25:47.104 --> 25:48.504
- I, um...

25:49.440 --> 25:51.215
Jessie was arrested last night.

25:51.366 --> 25:52.107
- For what?

25:52.276 --> 25:53.942
- She broke into a sperm bank.

25:53.944 --> 25:55.277
- Wait, what?

25:55.279 --> 25:57.613
- She's gotten so obsessed
with who her father was.

25:57.631 --> 26:02.208
Who the donor was.
Constantly asking questions.

26:02.286 --> 26:05.229
And I told her that I used
a particular cryobank.

26:05.306 --> 26:07.523
- I'm sorry, I'm...
I'm not following you.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.527
(distant dog barking)

26:13.072 --> 26:15.656
(distant car honking)

26:19.561 --> 26:24.331
- You know that thing
that happened between us.

26:25.567 --> 26:28.586
- That we agreed
to leave behind us.

26:28.737 --> 26:30.646
- Yes, but we didn't...

26:31.315 --> 26:33.424
...really leave it behind us.

26:36.244 --> 26:38.679
Jessie is your kid.

26:39.340 --> 26:40.339
- What?

26:40.600 --> 26:42.007
- She's been charged with
breaking and entering.

26:42.159 --> 26:43.525
I told a lawyer everything,

26:43.585 --> 26:46.495
and we agree that our best
defence is to tell the truth.

26:47.089 --> 26:50.107
I'll testify that I created
this outsized

26:50.184 --> 26:53.110
curiosity in Jessie by lying
to her about the sperm bank,

26:53.261 --> 26:56.338
keeping the secret about
who her father was.

26:56.340 --> 26:58.932
But I have to tell her
the truth before the hearing.

26:59.026 --> 27:00.859
- It happened one time.

27:00.936 --> 27:03.120
You... you said you did IVF.

27:03.271 --> 27:06.365
- Because Andrea was my friend
and I needed a story.

27:06.441 --> 27:08.142
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I should have.

27:08.144 --> 27:10.443
I just... I wanted
a baby so much

27:10.463 --> 27:12.445
and my doctors told me
I couldn't have one.

27:12.465 --> 27:15.466
So when I got pregnant, I
thought this was my only chance.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.594
I just...
(Kara sighs)

27:19.713 --> 27:20.863
(sighs)

27:20.865 --> 27:22.789
I didn't want to complicate
your life,

27:22.808 --> 27:25.476
or Andrea's, by telling you.

27:25.627 --> 27:28.220
- Then why did you stay here?
Why didn't you move?

27:28.296 --> 27:31.982
- Because I live in
a rent-stabilized apartment.

27:32.059 --> 27:33.375
I had no money.

27:33.394 --> 27:36.320
I had nowhere else to go!
And I...

27:37.064 --> 27:38.730
I think that...

27:38.883 --> 27:41.550
I think I thought it might be
comforting to have you nearby.

27:41.552 --> 27:43.160
- That's why you were
so worried about the kids.

27:43.237 --> 27:45.329
- Well, the truth will
solve that problem too.

27:45.480 --> 27:49.057
And now I don't have to keep
up this insane dance

27:49.059 --> 27:50.559
trying to keep them apart.

27:50.652 --> 27:52.503
- I'm so stupid.

27:52.654 --> 27:54.154
I couldn't figure out
what your problem was.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.990
- I thought that the kids
would feel like siblings,

27:57.067 --> 27:58.417
growing up next door
to each other.

27:58.493 --> 28:00.177
I never expected him
to fall for her.

28:00.328 --> 28:03.997
I never expect her
to be so obsessed.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.091
This is my fault, okay?

28:06.168 --> 28:08.835
But I have to tell the truth
now and I...

28:08.854 --> 28:10.270
I'm...

28:11.357 --> 28:14.525
(exhales)
I just wanted to tell you first.

28:15.010 --> 28:16.810
(sighs)

28:16.862 --> 28:18.696
- How am I gonna tell Andrea?

28:19.865 --> 28:21.423
- We have a lawyer.

28:21.442 --> 28:24.017
You don't have
to do us any favours.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.944
- And Will shouldn't
feel guilty.

28:26.021 --> 28:27.429
I mean, I told him to leave.

28:27.431 --> 28:30.708
I'm glad they didn't charge him.
That's what I wanted.

28:30.859 --> 28:32.042
- Can I talk to your mom a sec?

28:32.119 --> 28:33.785
- Why? It's my case.

28:33.862 --> 28:35.954
- Jessie, honey, do you have
to question everything?

28:36.031 --> 28:38.716
Please just give us a minute.
Please.

28:39.793 --> 28:42.594
(indistinct background chatter)

28:43.723 --> 28:44.722
- You haven't told her yet?

28:44.873 --> 28:47.516
- I was about to,
when you showed up.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.136
You haven't told Andrea?

28:51.213 --> 28:53.513
- I tried, but I couldn't do it.

28:54.475 --> 28:55.899
- Just listen,
here's the defence.

28:56.051 --> 28:57.309
She broke into snoop.
- Mm-hmm.

28:57.461 --> 28:59.219
- That was her only intention,

28:59.296 --> 29:01.813
which would make it trespassing,
it's a misdemeanour.

29:01.966 --> 29:03.556
Plus, Andrea will testify

29:03.576 --> 29:05.576
that Jessie has
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

29:05.727 --> 29:08.579
- Why would she do that?
She could lose her license.

29:08.730 --> 29:10.305
- I talked her into it.

29:10.307 --> 29:11.915
It might actually be true.

29:11.992 --> 29:14.493
Anyway, it's a mitigating
factor.

29:14.569 --> 29:16.161
- I, I...

29:16.313 --> 29:18.088
our lawyer said that
this judge is tough.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.240
- So why do you want to risk
a felony conviction?

29:20.259 --> 29:22.150
- Because this is my fault

29:22.169 --> 29:24.002
and I need the court
to know that!

29:24.154 --> 29:25.320
- You haven't told her
the truth yet

29:25.322 --> 29:26.538
because you don't really
want to.

29:26.615 --> 29:28.932
- Well...
- I can't tell Andrea, either.

29:29.084 --> 29:31.510
I tried, but my marriage
won't survive it.

29:32.329 --> 29:35.255
I'm begging you not
to blow up my family.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.733
We've kept the secret
this long.

29:40.354 --> 29:42.112
- What about the kids?
This romance?

29:42.114 --> 29:43.739
- I'll help you discourage it.

29:45.433 --> 29:47.025
- I just wish that
we could go back

29:47.102 --> 29:48.860
to things the way they were.

29:49.363 --> 29:53.040
- I'll ask for a continuance
to give us time to prepare.

29:56.629 --> 29:57.610
- Okay.

29:57.630 --> 30:00.214
- Okay?
- Yeah.

30:00.782 --> 30:01.632
Jessie?

30:06.030 --> 30:08.530
I think that Dominic
has a good plan.

30:08.532 --> 30:11.049
- What kind of plan?
- It's a two-part defence.

30:11.126 --> 30:12.384
- Wait, wait. What...

30:12.536 --> 30:14.386
what were you going to tell
me before he showed up?

30:14.538 --> 30:18.398
- That I love you,
and I'm behind you all the way.

30:19.819 --> 30:21.151
- That wasn't it.
- No.

30:21.228 --> 30:23.045
That was it and it's true.

30:23.047 --> 30:25.280
Are you okay with Dominic
defending you?

30:27.568 --> 30:29.051
- Okay, sure.

30:29.053 --> 30:30.702
You seem to have
already decided.

30:31.831 --> 30:34.039
Will?
(knocking)

30:34.741 --> 30:35.891
I need to talk to you.

30:35.909 --> 30:38.669
- Um, right, I need
to talk to you, too.

30:38.820 --> 30:41.246
- I don't know what's going
on with my mom and your dad.

30:41.398 --> 30:43.415
They have some weird defence
that I have OCD.

30:43.491 --> 30:45.417
And they think it's better than
what the other lawyer planned,

30:45.569 --> 30:47.069
but now my mom won't even
tell me what that was.

30:47.087 --> 30:48.328
And I just wanted to tell you

30:48.530 --> 30:50.681
the only thing that makes
sense in my life is you.

30:50.832 --> 30:52.591
- Um, right.

30:52.667 --> 30:54.259
I... like you, too.

30:54.336 --> 30:56.353
- No, no, no.
Like I really like you

30:56.504 --> 30:59.356
and I'm sorry we got interrupted
by that stupid alarm,

30:59.507 --> 31:01.917
because I really wanted
to kiss you.

31:01.919 --> 31:04.269
And I... still do.
- Um.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.922
I was...
(objects clattering)

31:06.924 --> 31:08.256
I was just about to text you.

31:08.258 --> 31:11.184
- Um... Will,
this is like a moment.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.612
Don't leave me hangin'.
- I'm not.

31:13.688 --> 31:14.955
I'm not. I mean...

31:16.024 --> 31:18.208
...we can't.
- Why? Are you afraid?

31:18.285 --> 31:20.360
I consent!
- No, no, it's not that.

31:20.379 --> 31:24.214
It's uh, I know...
I know who your father is.

31:25.033 --> 31:26.592
- You do? How?

31:28.036 --> 31:29.678
- Because he's my father.

31:30.556 --> 31:31.763
- What?

31:35.394 --> 31:38.896
- No, no. There has to be
some kinda mistake.

31:39.047 --> 31:42.274
- There's... there's no mistake.

31:43.794 --> 31:47.220
Remember you threw your DNA
test in the trash chute?

31:47.297 --> 31:49.965
- Yeah.
- Well, it didn't, uh,

31:49.983 --> 31:50.908
it didn't stay there.

31:50.984 --> 31:52.242
I found the tube.

31:52.469 --> 31:55.153
I mailed it in, with your name
and a new email address.

31:55.305 --> 31:58.415
I just wanted to help figure
out the mystery. I...

31:58.566 --> 32:00.900
It seemed unfair that your mom
wouldn't let you figure it out.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.827
- What about the test?

32:02.904 --> 32:03.903
- Yeah.

32:03.923 --> 32:07.090
(amusing music)

32:07.651 --> 32:11.577
I took one a year ago
for a biology project.

32:12.005 --> 32:15.432
And we share like a quarter
of our DNA.

32:15.583 --> 32:17.842
Which means that...
(Jessie sighs)

32:17.995 --> 32:20.395
...my dad is your dad.

32:23.684 --> 32:26.851
- So it wasn't that my mom's
feelings were hurt.

32:27.004 --> 32:27.945
(scoffs)

32:28.021 --> 32:29.262
- No.

32:29.339 --> 32:31.949
- It was because
he was next door.

32:33.101 --> 32:35.193
(Kara): I didn't know
what else to do.

32:35.270 --> 32:36.787
(Jessie): You lied to me
my whole life!

32:36.863 --> 32:39.939
- You have to see
why I did that.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.441
- I don't!

32:41.518 --> 32:45.520
- I just wanted to give you
a simple, happy childhood.

32:45.522 --> 32:49.282
I wanted them to have
their family, undisrupted.

32:49.359 --> 32:51.376
- Oh, and how is that
working out?

32:51.453 --> 32:52.135
(sighs)

32:52.362 --> 32:53.361
(Will): Why didn't you tell us?

32:53.363 --> 32:56.006
- I didn't know.
I just found out.

32:56.158 --> 32:57.882
- You knew that you slept
with Kara,

32:57.959 --> 32:59.050
nine months before Jessie
was born.

32:59.203 --> 33:01.369
- Yeah, it's pretty basic math.

33:01.796 --> 33:04.039
- Kara said she did IVF, okay?

33:04.041 --> 33:06.041
And there was a lot
going on back then.

33:06.043 --> 33:07.892
It... I was trying to
start my law practice.

33:07.969 --> 33:08.986
Fern was two.

33:09.137 --> 33:11.137
- So mom's taking care
of a two-year-old,

33:11.156 --> 33:13.806
and you're sleeping with...
Oh my...

33:13.826 --> 33:16.809
- Was Mom pregnant with Will?

33:16.887 --> 33:18.737
(exhales)

33:18.889 --> 33:19.496
- Maybe.

33:19.573 --> 33:20.539
But we didn't know yet.

33:20.815 --> 33:24.001
And it was one time,
after too many drinks.

33:24.228 --> 33:26.244
We were all friends.

33:26.321 --> 33:28.730
- Yeah, and now Mom
and Kara aren't friends.

33:28.749 --> 33:29.748
And it's your fault.

33:30.009 --> 33:31.733
- Okay, your mom doesn't
know about any of this.

33:31.735 --> 33:32.867
- Well, we have to tell her.

33:32.903 --> 33:34.678
(door opens)
It's not fair.

33:36.073 --> 33:37.681
- Hey, guys.

33:38.592 --> 33:41.018
Did you find Kara and Jessie
at the courthouse?

33:41.127 --> 33:43.094
- Yeah.
- How'd it go?

33:43.171 --> 33:47.082
- Mom, I think you
should sit down.

33:47.084 --> 33:48.841
(clears throat)
- Just...

33:48.861 --> 33:50.435
just give me a second, okay?

33:50.512 --> 33:51.511
- What's going on?

33:51.772 --> 33:55.532
(Kara): Jessie, I am not proud
of any of this.

33:55.609 --> 33:57.284
But I am...

33:58.019 --> 33:59.444
...so proud of you.

33:59.596 --> 34:05.116
And without my admittedly
bad mistakes,

34:05.269 --> 34:06.859
you wouldn't be here.

34:06.879 --> 34:09.212
So I can't regret them.

34:09.289 --> 34:13.032
(crying): I just did the best
that I could.

34:13.052 --> 34:16.219
(sobs, sniffles)

34:20.784 --> 34:22.559
I love you.

34:24.563 --> 34:27.046
(Andrea): Oh, I knew something
was wrong, back then.

34:27.066 --> 34:28.732
I knew it.

34:33.130 --> 34:34.571
Why'd you do it?

34:35.982 --> 34:37.657
- I don't know.

34:39.060 --> 34:40.994
I don't know.
I, I...

34:42.063 --> 34:45.156
(sighs)
I think maybe...

34:46.234 --> 34:49.086
...you were so preoccupied
with Fern and I just...

34:49.237 --> 34:50.903
it didn't feel like there
was any room for me.

34:50.923 --> 34:53.481
- I'd been feeding her
from my body!

34:53.500 --> 34:55.984
I never slept! How was
I supposed to not be occupied?

34:56.002 --> 34:57.168
- I'm not saying it
as an excuse,

34:57.262 --> 34:59.321
I'm just trying to tell you
where my head was.

34:59.323 --> 35:01.014
- Where your head was?

35:02.159 --> 35:03.558
(dry chuckle)
Yeah.

35:05.829 --> 35:06.995
- Please, Andrea.

35:06.997 --> 35:08.330
I just want to make this right.

35:08.348 --> 35:09.347
I know you always wanna keep

35:09.424 --> 35:10.923
your patients' families
together.

35:10.943 --> 35:12.692
- You're not my patient,
Dominic.

35:16.764 --> 35:19.658
(soft music)

35:21.862 --> 35:24.103
Listen, guys.

35:24.181 --> 35:27.273
This has nothing to do
with you, okay?

35:27.351 --> 35:30.685
I'm just gonna go to my sister's
for a while

35:30.704 --> 35:31.962
and I'll call you
really soon.

35:32.113 --> 35:35.132
- Shouldn't Dad leave?
He's the one who screwed up.

35:35.283 --> 35:37.375
- That's true.
I can go to a hotel.

35:37.527 --> 35:40.595
- Don't you get it? I don't
want to be in this building!

35:41.865 --> 35:44.883
It's okay. Really. I just...

35:44.959 --> 35:46.560
I just need some time.

35:47.537 --> 35:48.436
Okay?

35:49.723 --> 35:51.398
I'll be at Aunt Vonnie's.

35:52.967 --> 35:54.693
I love you.

36:02.494 --> 36:03.577
- Mom,

36:05.998 --> 36:07.664
please don't go.

36:09.893 --> 36:10.892
- We need you.

36:10.911 --> 36:12.669
- I'm not leaving you two.

36:13.988 --> 36:16.339
Take care of each other, okay?

36:38.530 --> 36:41.147
- Okay. That is not what I was
expecting from the breaking

36:41.200 --> 36:43.366
and entering case on my docket
this morning.

36:43.518 --> 36:45.851
I commend you all for telling
the truth,

36:45.929 --> 36:47.704
to each other and to me.

36:47.855 --> 36:50.022
I think,
given the circumstances,

36:50.116 --> 36:52.100
that six months of probation

36:52.118 --> 36:55.879
and 30 hours of community
service is appropriate.

36:56.030 --> 36:58.048
This court is adjourned.

36:58.700 --> 37:00.383
Good luck, Jessie.

37:01.778 --> 37:04.721
(light upbeat music)

37:06.892 --> 37:10.644
- Oh! Honey! Oh!

37:11.805 --> 37:13.045
Thank you for helping us.

37:13.065 --> 37:14.789
- It was all you and Jessie.

37:14.791 --> 37:16.048
- No, I, I...

37:16.068 --> 37:17.883
(chuckling)
I mean it.

37:17.885 --> 37:20.228
- I would've been so nervous.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.631
- I'm glad you told the truth.
- Me too.

37:23.633 --> 37:25.200
I think.

37:26.152 --> 37:27.819
Is uh, your mom coming home?

37:27.971 --> 37:29.454
- Not yet.

37:30.807 --> 37:32.231
(indistinct chatter)

37:32.325 --> 37:35.460
(Jessie): I can't believe it.
(Kara): Man, am I proud of you.

37:36.738 --> 37:39.673
(soft music)

37:41.501 --> 37:44.002
- You've been out early.
- Community service.

37:44.078 --> 37:46.321
I am so good at picking
up trash now.

37:46.339 --> 37:48.598
(Dominic chuckles)
- I bet!

37:49.843 --> 37:51.250
You want a croissant?

37:51.270 --> 37:54.162
I got them for my, for uh...
uh Fern and Will.

37:54.180 --> 37:57.107
Um, there's chocolate,
almond, and regular.

37:57.258 --> 37:59.050
- I'm more of a doughnut person.

37:59.202 --> 38:00.944
- Right.
I should know that.

38:01.095 --> 38:03.446
I would know that...

38:07.010 --> 38:08.451
I mean, you probably don't
wanna hear this,

38:08.528 --> 38:12.372
but you do actually remind me
of myself when I was your age.

38:13.199 --> 38:15.125
More so than Will and Fern.

38:15.276 --> 38:17.627
They're trying so hard
to be different from me.

38:19.356 --> 38:23.115
- Do you, um, sneeze after
drinking cold water?

38:23.135 --> 38:24.968
- Yeah! I think I do.
(Jessie chuckles)

38:25.119 --> 38:26.303
Is that a genetic thing?

38:26.530 --> 38:29.121
- Apparently.
Do you like cilantro?

38:29.199 --> 38:31.032
- No. No, it tastes like soap.

38:31.034 --> 38:33.292
- Totally.
(elevator dings)

38:33.386 --> 38:35.145
We don't seem to have any more
Neanderthal genes

38:35.296 --> 38:37.555
than most people do.
- Oh, that's too bad.

38:37.632 --> 38:39.965
I hear Neanderthals
are making a comeback.

38:40.043 --> 38:41.693
They got a bad rap.

38:44.823 --> 38:48.049
- Um, did you love my mom?

38:48.051 --> 38:49.642
- No.

38:49.644 --> 38:50.902
I mean, I liked her.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.454
And I'm really...

38:53.665 --> 38:54.647
...glad you're here.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.391
And Will loves you.

38:56.393 --> 38:58.393
I mean, not like that,
hopefully.

38:59.229 --> 39:01.245
But it's good to have
a sibling, right?

39:01.398 --> 39:03.506
Someone to share a history with.

39:03.658 --> 39:06.401
You won't have to be the sister
who organizes Thanksgiving

39:06.403 --> 39:10.013
when you grow up, because Fern's
totally got that handled.

39:12.184 --> 39:14.351
- My mom and I were talking,
and we think we should move.

39:14.427 --> 39:18.170
It might be easier for Andrea
to come back, if we're not here.

39:18.264 --> 39:20.673
- No, you shouldn't
have to do that.

39:20.692 --> 39:21.875
This is your home.

39:22.361 --> 39:24.752
I'm working really hard to try
to make this all better.

39:24.771 --> 39:27.438
- Mm... good luck with that.

39:28.274 --> 39:31.684
I will take an apology
croissant.

39:31.761 --> 39:32.852
- Oh, okay.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.662
(Jessie chuckles)

39:36.691 --> 39:38.249
- Thank you.

39:45.867 --> 39:47.667
(birds chirping)

39:48.220 --> 39:49.719
- Thanks for coming.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.055
I wasn't sure you would.

39:52.132 --> 39:54.349
- I wanted to see you, so much.
I just...

39:55.543 --> 39:57.560
I wasn't sure that
you'd want to see me.

39:57.637 --> 39:59.211
- I was pretty mad.

40:00.290 --> 40:02.807
- No milk, no sugar.
Is that still right?

40:03.309 --> 40:07.904
- It's my job to get people
to see the things

40:07.981 --> 40:10.407
that they know on
an unconscious level.

40:10.409 --> 40:15.203
I mean, I just
totally failed at it.

40:16.915 --> 40:20.232
It's embarrassing.
(scoffs): No.

40:20.310 --> 40:23.253
- I mean, maybe I did
know in some way.

40:23.404 --> 40:27.331
My brain said,
"Something's wrong here."

40:27.484 --> 40:32.003
And it was a thorn
in my marriage.

40:32.155 --> 40:35.506
Which was already shaky,
because he was right.

40:35.659 --> 40:37.600
I was completely besotted
with Fern.

40:37.677 --> 40:41.162
And then with Will, I had no
emotional energy left for him.

40:41.255 --> 40:43.273
- Okay, you can't...

40:43.349 --> 40:45.442
you can't blame yourself
for that.

40:45.518 --> 40:46.568
- I don't.

40:50.264 --> 40:52.356
- I... I pulled away from you.

40:52.433 --> 40:54.659
And I know that you felt that.

40:56.346 --> 40:58.413
- It was so confusing.

40:59.866 --> 41:02.417
We both had little kids.

41:03.478 --> 41:04.869
I thought we would
help each other.

41:05.021 --> 41:07.613
(sighs)
- Yeah.

41:07.691 --> 41:09.048
I just...

41:12.195 --> 41:14.554
I felt so ashamed.

41:15.289 --> 41:18.016
And I wanted to pretend

41:19.627 --> 41:22.870
that Jessie wasn't a result
of my betraying my friend

41:22.872 --> 41:24.689
and it wasn't true, and...

41:26.467 --> 41:30.820
...it felt easier to let
our friendship die

41:30.972 --> 41:32.730
than to spend time with you.

41:32.882 --> 41:35.049
- God, that makes me so sad.

41:35.068 --> 41:36.308
- Me too.

41:36.386 --> 41:37.401
I'm looking for another place
to live,

41:37.554 --> 41:39.496
so you can come back
from your sister's.

41:39.723 --> 41:44.650
- That's what Dominic said.
That's why I wanted to talk.

41:44.728 --> 41:47.420
(emotional music)

41:48.581 --> 41:50.632
I'm not over it.

41:52.068 --> 41:54.385
It's gonna take some time.

41:56.239 --> 41:58.640
But I want what's best
for my family.

42:00.927 --> 42:02.519
And I don't think you should go.

42:04.430 --> 42:09.083
(♪ Thieving Dreams
by Bebe Wood)

42:09.602 --> 42:12.770
- You okay, buddy?
- Yeah, I'm good.

42:13.423 --> 42:15.089
- Uh, did you get the scoop?

42:15.108 --> 42:17.534
- Uh, no.
- Okay, so,

42:17.610 --> 42:20.519
you show the front cover,
read the back cover aloud,

42:20.597 --> 42:23.355
and then everyone has to write
a made-up first sentence,

42:23.433 --> 42:25.858
trying to trick everyone into
thinking it's the real one.

42:25.935 --> 42:26.934
- Oh. Okay.

42:26.953 --> 42:28.102
- It's hard to convince my mom,

42:28.121 --> 42:29.546
she's scary good at guessing.

42:29.697 --> 42:31.214
- I think we've established that
that is not true.

42:31.441 --> 42:34.108
- It's totally true.
Okay, I'll go first.

42:34.127 --> 42:36.277
Oh, check out that duke.

42:36.279 --> 42:38.203
Think there's a secret
baby in it?

42:38.298 --> 42:40.298
(Andrea): Fern.
(chuckling)

42:40.450 --> 42:42.800
- Oh, don't we have sprinkles?

42:42.877 --> 42:43.876
- Oh, right, sprinkles.

42:43.895 --> 42:45.228
(Kara): All right.

42:45.305 --> 42:49.399
- Okay, we have vanilla,
mint chip, and butter pecan.

42:49.550 --> 42:50.716
Who wants what?
- Mint chip, please!

42:50.735 --> 42:51.793
- Tastes like toothpaste.

42:51.811 --> 42:52.902
- Which makes it
the best flavour.

42:52.979 --> 42:55.572
- Wait, you put sprinkles
on mint chip?

42:55.723 --> 42:56.889
- Only chocolate ones.

42:56.908 --> 42:58.390
- Butter pecan for me.

42:58.410 --> 43:00.151
- Vanilla, for me.
No sprinkles.

43:00.227 --> 43:01.685
I like to keep it simple.

43:01.838 --> 43:03.137
- Yep. Same for me.

43:03.230 --> 43:06.916
- Okay, we have chocolate
and the disgusting rainbow ones.

43:06.993 --> 43:07.975
(both): They're not disgusting!

43:07.994 --> 43:09.735
(all three): Jinx.
Jinx!

43:09.813 --> 43:11.904
(laughing)

43:11.981 --> 43:14.591
(♪♪)
