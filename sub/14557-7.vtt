WEBVTT

00:12.880 --> 00:14.382
CHARLIE:
What do you say, Larry?

00:14.415 --> 00:17.318
The Eagle, the Shark?

00:17.351 --> 00:18.319
Oh, I think the Eagle.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.487
More stability.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.422
Let's go, bro.
Show us how it's done.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.057
( grunts )

00:25.493 --> 00:27.061
( group groaning )

00:27.095 --> 00:28.562
Ah, that close...

00:28.596 --> 00:30.464
Nice, all right.

00:30.498 --> 00:31.332
Watch this.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.367
All right, go for it.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.035
Oh, yeah.

00:37.505 --> 00:39.140
Oh!

00:39.173 --> 00:39.840
Yes!

00:39.873 --> 00:41.809
- Oh! Nice!
- Nice.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.177
- Nice throw, brother.
- Sweet, right?

00:43.211 --> 00:45.279
You know, Don,
you and I are very alike.

00:45.313 --> 00:47.415
We're both focused on large,

00:47.448 --> 00:49.417
possibly unattainable goals--

00:49.450 --> 00:51.552
me trying to explain all
the workings of the universe...

00:51.585 --> 00:53.087
Yeah. What am I doing?

00:53.121 --> 00:54.722
Trying to take all
the unworkable workings

00:54.755 --> 00:56.190
and put them in jail.
(phone rings)

00:56.224 --> 00:59.293
Good luck to both of us.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.229
Eppes.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.666
Yeah. All right.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.435
Okay, I'm on my way.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.103
Sorry, guys, got to go.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.404
You know, work.
I'll see you,

01:10.438 --> 01:12.840
all right?

01:12.873 --> 01:15.143
Yeah. Well, there he goes,
back to the unattainable.

01:17.345 --> 01:19.347
( garbled radio transmission)

01:19.380 --> 01:21.649
( indistinct chatter )

01:21.682 --> 01:24.385
MEGAN: Hi. They killed the
father

01:24.418 --> 01:25.619
when he tried
to resist.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.388
Seems just like
the third robbery.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.390
It's the same
guys-- ski masks,

01:29.423 --> 01:31.859
physical descriptions match
the other home invasions.

01:31.892 --> 01:33.494
This puts us up to seven

01:33.527 --> 01:36.830
in six months, so they're coming
at faster intervals.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.599
They go after any
specific items?

01:38.632 --> 01:39.833
Yeah.

01:39.867 --> 01:42.636
Jewelry, paintings,
high-end furnishings.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.649
The deceased is
Dr. Richard Bloom.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.186
He and his wife arrived home
with their 15-year-old

01:58.219 --> 02:00.454
son, Jordan,
after a school track meet.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.456
Three guys rushed them
at the front door.

02:02.490 --> 02:03.757
Bound them up
with duct tape.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.526
Did you see this?

02:05.559 --> 02:07.428
Yeah.

02:07.461 --> 02:10.364
The son put up a struggle,
and one of the burglars hit him.

02:10.398 --> 02:12.466
The father tried
to stop him,

02:12.500 --> 02:14.235
and they threw him
in the pool,

02:14.268 --> 02:16.337
hands and feet still bound,

02:16.370 --> 02:19.173
and laughed while he drowned.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.577
DAVID:
Daughter's name is Jill.

02:23.611 --> 02:24.678
She was at a
friend's house.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.247
Her friend's mom
brought her back

02:26.280 --> 02:27.415
home, saw something was wrong.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.550
She called 911.

02:29.583 --> 02:30.718
Daughter didn't
see anything.

02:30.751 --> 02:31.852
Thank God.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.288
Right now, someone has
to tell her her Daddy's dead.

02:40.361 --> 02:43.197
We all use math every day,

02:43.231 --> 02:44.465
to predict weather,

02:44.498 --> 02:47.768
to tell time,

02:47.801 --> 02:48.469
to handle money.

02:50.738 --> 02:54.442
Math is more than formulas
and equations.

02:54.475 --> 02:57.945
It's logic.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.548
It's rationality.

03:00.581 --> 03:03.217
It's using your mind

03:03.251 --> 03:04.618
to solve the biggest mysteries
we know.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.826
So, we got seven
home invasions, right?

03:12.860 --> 03:14.862
This is before LAPD asked
for our help.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.464
This is after.

03:16.497 --> 03:17.865
What we know is that they-they
do have weapons,

03:17.898 --> 03:19.433
although they
haven't fired them,

03:19.467 --> 03:20.468
so we have no
useful forensics.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.403
And they all live
in exclusive neighborhoods,

03:22.436 --> 03:23.671
they all have high-end,

03:23.704 --> 03:25.506
expensive valuables
in their homes,

03:25.539 --> 03:26.640
and they all have
security systems,

03:26.674 --> 03:29.310
but the attacks take place
just as they're coming in,

03:29.343 --> 03:30.544
and the alarms have
been turned off.

03:34.382 --> 03:35.583
Who are they?

03:35.616 --> 03:37.418
DON:
They're both fathers.

03:37.451 --> 03:40.354
They both fought back
to protect their families.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.555
I mean, we can't even figure out

03:41.589 --> 03:42.556
how these guys
are picking the homes.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.292
MEGAN: No. So far, there's no
commonalities

03:44.325 --> 03:45.426
between the
families.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.728
You know, other than the fact
that they're wealthy.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.397
Let's try data mining.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.365
It's a system
for analyzing information.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.500
MEGAN: Army Intelligence uses
that

03:52.533 --> 03:55.403
to identify possible
terrorist attacks.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.771
I design an algorithm
based on these crimes.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.340
The algorithm then
takes the data

03:59.373 --> 04:00.974
and identifies correlations.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.042
All right. I'll get you
everything

04:02.075 --> 04:03.444
we have on the families.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.645
MEGAN: Yeah, where they live,
where

04:04.678 --> 04:06.347
they go to school,
shop, dine out.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.449
Who cleans their pools,
who fixes their cars.

04:08.482 --> 04:09.683
I'll need more than that.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.285
More than everything
on the families?

04:11.319 --> 04:13.487
More... on everything.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.489
All crime stats
for the past six months

04:15.523 --> 04:16.690
for the entire county.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.526
MEGAN: Wouldn't that much data

04:18.559 --> 04:20.361
make it harder to find
what you're looking for?

04:20.394 --> 04:21.395
CHARLIE:
The opposite.

04:21.429 --> 04:23.931
More data means more chances
to find something.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.367
It's like when you're trying
to put together a jigsaw puzzle.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.536
You start with a few pieces,
and the rest are in the box.

04:28.569 --> 04:32.440
All the pieces you have should
eventually fit your puzzle.

04:32.473 --> 04:35.376
All the pieces and nothing more
come in the box.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.610
But with a real-world problem,

04:36.644 --> 04:38.979
that's just like trying
to solve a jigsaw puzzle

04:39.012 --> 04:40.481
when all the pieces you need
are mixed in

04:40.514 --> 04:43.050
with pieces
from many other puzzles.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.553
Now, when you grab a few pieces
from the box,

04:45.586 --> 04:46.587
most won't fit.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.788
You got to go through
the entire box

04:47.821 --> 04:51.559
and pull out the pieces
that fit your puzzle.

04:51.592 --> 04:55.696
The algorithm goes
through it all, pulls out what

04:55.729 --> 04:56.764
fits together.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.767
All right. Well, I'll get you
our reports, okay?

04:59.800 --> 05:00.801
CHARLIE
Hey, guys.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.937
Hey, I've got a complex data
analysis problem.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.806
Either of you free?
Well, both of you?

05:05.839 --> 05:07.575
I'd prefer both.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.710
I... Well, I have some,
a couple of hours.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.745
Charlie, have you seen
the guest lecture schedule

05:11.779 --> 05:12.913
for this week?

05:12.946 --> 05:14.382
No, I haven't.
Why?

05:14.415 --> 05:15.583
Oh, don't... Damn it.

05:15.616 --> 05:18.352
Don't tell me I've gotten stuck
hosting another reception.

05:18.386 --> 05:20.588
No. Uh, some guy's
giving a talk

05:20.621 --> 05:22.423
on the asymptotics
of random matrices.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.525
Hey, you've done some
distinguished work there,

05:24.558 --> 05:25.826
haven't you?

05:25.859 --> 05:27.127
The guest lecturer's
name is...

05:27.160 --> 05:29.597
What the hell is that son
of a bitch doing here?

05:29.630 --> 05:31.365
To whom are
you referring?

05:33.033 --> 05:34.468
Marshall Penfield.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.370
That's the guy--
the guy that's giving the talk.

05:36.404 --> 05:37.805
Oh, really?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.507
Marshall and I--

05:39.540 --> 05:41.074
we attended Princeton together.

05:41.108 --> 05:45.145
Every chance he got,
he slammed my work.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.747
And the only keg
party I ever threw--

05:46.780 --> 05:48.081
he stole the keg.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.583
Marshall.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.385
Hey, Eppesy.
You coming to the talk?

05:51.419 --> 05:52.453
It's gonna be a good one.

05:52.486 --> 05:53.754
I just
heard about it.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.489
Ever so excited. Wondering

05:55.523 --> 05:57.758
what your subject could be.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.159
Oh, same old
same old.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.462
Hi. How you doing?

06:01.495 --> 06:03.096
CHARLIE:
You found a new approach?

06:03.130 --> 06:06.400
Only because
I recall your earlier attacks

06:06.434 --> 06:07.868
on my analysis
of Plancharel measures.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.037
You made an ass of yourself.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.472
( chuckles ):
Yes, but unlike you,

06:11.505 --> 06:13.441
I continued to work
in the field.

06:13.474 --> 06:16.109
And I've made
some interesting findings.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.412
Elaborate.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.614
A flaw in your work.

06:20.648 --> 06:22.616
I'll spare you
the details.

06:22.650 --> 06:25.753
I'll save it for the talk,
but, bottom line--

06:25.786 --> 06:28.188
your big breakthrough,
the Eppes Convergence?

06:28.221 --> 06:30.524
It's wrong.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.094
It was nice meeting you.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.769
MRS. BLOOM:
These things-- most of them

06:41.802 --> 06:44.638
have been in our families
for years.

06:44.672 --> 06:47.608
I don't care
about any of this.

06:47.641 --> 06:50.043
But Richard--

06:50.077 --> 06:51.979
he was only trying
to protect our son.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.213
I know, Mrs. Bloom.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.615
I'm so sorry.

06:54.648 --> 06:57.050
He just couldn't bear
to see people hurt.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.586
It's why he became a doctor.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.187
I just think

07:00.220 --> 07:02.022
if maybe you could tell me
anything

07:02.055 --> 07:03.557
about one of these pieces,

07:03.591 --> 07:05.893
it might help me
find your husband's killer.

07:08.696 --> 07:09.863
There's a lamp.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.632
It was, uh, made
by Dirk Van Erp.

07:11.665 --> 07:15.068
It's one of a pair.

07:15.102 --> 07:19.640
Richard got the first one
for me as a wedding present,

07:19.673 --> 07:24.011
and he spent years
trying to find the other one.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.079
He finally found it.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.181
He said
they belonged together,

07:28.215 --> 07:31.819
just like we did.

07:31.852 --> 07:32.886
DON:
So, this lamp's worth, like,

07:32.920 --> 07:34.522
$100,000.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.924
Which, I imagine, you can't just
sell just anywhere.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.125
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.793
We should check into whatever
markets deal

07:39.827 --> 07:40.994
with this kind of stuff, see if
there's any buzz.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.229
Mm-hmm.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.797
CHARLIE:
Penfield hates me.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.833
It drove him crazy.

07:45.866 --> 07:46.967
I became the youngest person

07:47.000 --> 07:48.769
to ever publish a major paper,

07:48.802 --> 07:51.639
and when I gave my first seminar
on the Eppes Convergence,

07:51.672 --> 07:54.074
he shows up with a button
that says, uh,

07:54.107 --> 07:55.142
"Don't believe the hype."

07:55.175 --> 07:56.510
LARRY ( laughs ):
Okay.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.245
Well, that's a little
confrontational.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.813
But, I mean, you were a star
in your field.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.815
You-you got to expect this kind
of attention.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.250
This man has singled me out.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.753
No. Your status has
singled you out.

08:05.786 --> 08:09.523
I mean, people-people are
scrutinizing your work because

08:09.557 --> 08:10.591
of your
reputation.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.693
You must understand--
that's why he's doing it.

08:12.726 --> 08:13.927
To ruin my reputation.

08:13.961 --> 08:16.564
The Eppes Convergence
made me.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.599
If it's wrong,

08:18.632 --> 08:19.933
then what am I?

08:19.967 --> 08:21.602
Well, you're
a talented,

08:21.635 --> 08:23.937
theoretician
with an ego problem?

08:23.971 --> 08:25.172
I'm sorry?

08:25.205 --> 08:27.040
( phone ringing )

08:30.911 --> 08:32.045
Hello?

08:32.079 --> 08:33.914
Yeah, I'll be
right there.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.749
I got to go.

08:35.783 --> 08:36.650
Okay.

08:36.684 --> 08:37.818
The computer lab says

08:37.851 --> 08:39.887
the algorithm for Don's case
kicked out some findings.

08:39.920 --> 08:40.788
Yeah.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.124
Well, wisdom and genius--

08:44.157 --> 08:46.560
rarely present
in equal abundance.

08:48.662 --> 08:51.965
I don't remember
where I got this lamp.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.634
Probably some estate sale.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.302
Wrong answer.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.904
Hands behind your back
right now.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.305
- What's going on?
- You know what's going on.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.107
You can tell us
where you got it here,

09:00.140 --> 09:01.341
or you can tell us down

09:01.374 --> 09:02.710
at our office.

09:02.743 --> 09:03.911
That's after we walk you

09:03.944 --> 09:04.945
through your show room
full of customers.

09:04.978 --> 09:05.946
Wait, wait. Okay.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.047
Where did you get it?

09:07.080 --> 09:08.882
( sighs )

09:08.916 --> 09:10.884
I was introduced to this guy
a few months ago.

09:10.918 --> 09:13.153
His name is Roley.

09:13.186 --> 09:16.690
He told me he got the lamp
from a bankruptcy procedure.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.826
But you knew better,
didn't you?

09:22.362 --> 09:24.932
( humming )

09:34.908 --> 09:36.043
DON:
Colby.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.077
Your brother
is starting

09:37.110 --> 09:38.311
to freak me out
a little bit.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.047
DON:
What, just a little?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.314
Hey. What's up?

09:41.348 --> 09:43.984
Calendars are
wonderful

09:44.017 --> 09:44.985
analog mathematical
tools.

09:45.018 --> 09:49.056
They create a universal
timeline for societies

09:49.089 --> 09:51.058
by interpreting
astrophysical movement.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.360
What are you talking about?

09:53.393 --> 09:55.629
CHARLIE: Calendars aren't based
on easily divisible factors.

09:55.663 --> 09:58.198
Okay? You know, they originally
tried to make them like that.

09:58.231 --> 10:01.334
360 days divides
quite evenly, but

10:01.368 --> 10:03.270
doesn't match with what you see
in the night sky,

10:03.303 --> 10:05.673
so ancient calendars
would add an extra month

10:05.706 --> 10:07.374
every eight
years, or tack on

10:07.407 --> 10:09.276
five extra days.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.944
What, these were all the dates
from the home invasions?

10:10.978 --> 10:11.879
Right. Once I got

10:11.912 --> 10:14.081
the data mining algorithm
up and running,

10:14.114 --> 10:16.349
I ran a Fourier analysis
on the chronologies--

10:16.383 --> 10:17.150
the dates, the times.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.786
COLBY: We've actually been
looking

10:18.819 --> 10:20.120
to try and find
a timeline pattern, Charlie,

10:20.153 --> 10:21.388
but we can't come up
with anything.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.891
Because you weren't looking in
the same way my analysis does.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.026
The red days are

10:26.059 --> 10:27.194
known attacks.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.962
The blue days are
when the analysis says

10:28.996 --> 10:30.998
there should be attacks,
but there aren't.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.966
And what we must
ask ourselves is:

10:33.000 --> 10:35.368
How do you know there aren't?

10:35.402 --> 10:37.905
No homes were hit
on those dates, right?

10:37.938 --> 10:39.006
CHARLIE:
Let's assume

10:39.039 --> 10:42.109
that these same guys
commit other types of crimes.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.977
You mean, not just
home invasions.

10:44.011 --> 10:47.014
DON: So, you're saying, what, if
we find new crimes,

10:47.047 --> 10:48.849
- maybe we find new evidence?
- CHARLIE: I think you should

10:48.882 --> 10:50.984
be looking for crimes
committed by gunmen

10:51.018 --> 10:53.153
that fit the same description,
that occur

10:53.186 --> 10:55.088
in these days
that I've marked blue.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.389
And Charlie, the pattern.

10:56.423 --> 10:59.059
Can it tell us
when the next attack would be?

10:59.092 --> 11:01.995
CHARLIE: Patterns like this
are-are clearer in hindsight.

11:02.029 --> 11:04.064
I mean, they're not really used
as-as predictors.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.066
I mean, there's an erratic
frequency here.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.901
I mean, you know,
there's several

11:07.935 --> 11:09.703
robberies a couple days apart,

11:09.737 --> 11:11.038
and then there's one or two
hits,

11:11.071 --> 11:12.005
and then an even shorter break.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.042
Just point us
in a direction.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.009
( exhales )

11:16.043 --> 11:17.477
This is my best guess.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.914
It's possible that the
next attack could occur

11:20.948 --> 11:23.450
in three days.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.025
I checked the incident reports
on the days

11:32.059 --> 11:33.994
where Charlie said there
might have been related crimes.

11:34.027 --> 11:37.865
I found three carjackings
done by three guys in ski masks

11:37.898 --> 11:39.166
that match the physical
descriptions

11:39.199 --> 11:40.901
- of our home invaders.
- COLBY: Our guys

11:40.934 --> 11:42.402
go for the high-end goods,
though, Megan.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.037
The cars stolen were a Mercedes,

11:44.071 --> 11:45.973
Range Rover and a Porsche.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.507
- Any of them found?
- No, which means

11:47.540 --> 11:49.442
either they were repainted
and given new VINs

11:49.476 --> 11:50.543
or they were sold
outside the area.

11:50.577 --> 11:53.113
These guys seem to know
how to move expensive items.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.347
And there's something else.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.117
We've never had a gun fired
in any of the home invasions...

11:57.150 --> 11:58.451
There's a gunshot
in the carjacking.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.187
Yes, there was.
At the Porsche robbery,

12:00.220 --> 12:02.489
one of the members of the crew
shot a round into the air

12:02.522 --> 12:03.623
to scare the owner.

12:03.656 --> 12:06.159
We find that bullet, we might
be able to make a match.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.028
You want to find a bullet
fired straight up?

12:08.061 --> 12:09.262
- It's not gonna be easy.
- It's not impossible.

12:09.296 --> 12:10.998
Just find the cops
who responded to the call.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.432
DAVID: They would've done a
neighborhood canvas

12:12.465 --> 12:14.067
to ID the round
that was fired.

12:14.101 --> 12:14.902
We should be talking to

12:14.935 --> 12:16.036
the people whose cars
were jacked,

12:16.069 --> 12:18.505
running down the lead
from the antique store owner.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.007
- What's the fence's name?
- Roley. I'm on it.

12:20.040 --> 12:20.974
Good.
All right.

12:22.009 --> 12:23.343
DAVID:
A bad time?

12:23.376 --> 12:25.478
No, come on in.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.314
I'm just sitting here,
waiting for

12:27.347 --> 12:31.018
a new run of the
data mining program.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.285
Emergence theory.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.821
The whole is greater than

12:33.854 --> 12:35.555
the sum of its parts.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.790
Individually, ants have
limited capabilities.

12:36.824 --> 12:41.061
But the colony can be viewed
as a single complex organism.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.163
But you guys aren't here

12:43.196 --> 12:44.531
to talk about ants, are you?

12:44.564 --> 12:47.935
No, actually, we have
a little bet.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.402
David here seems
to think that you might

12:49.436 --> 12:50.871
be able to help us find

12:50.904 --> 12:52.039
a needle in a haystack.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.373
A bullet in Brentwood,
to be exact.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.075
COLBY: Checking the time periods
where you thought

12:55.108 --> 12:56.810
there might be related crimes,

12:56.844 --> 12:58.545
we found three carjackings--
one of them, there was gunfire.

12:58.578 --> 12:59.412
We find that bullet,

12:59.446 --> 13:01.581
we might be able
to match it to a gun.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.316
This bullet, was it fired

13:03.350 --> 13:05.118
parallel to the ground
or at an angle?

13:05.152 --> 13:07.320
According to the crime report,
into the air.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.421
We're not sure of

13:08.455 --> 13:09.489
the exact angle.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.058
What type of gun?

13:11.091 --> 13:15.095
Uh, we're actually not certain
about that, either.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.997
CHARLIE: Okay, we're looking at
at least two variables.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.031
Any handgun's going to

13:18.065 --> 13:20.433
fall into a certain range
of muzzle velocity.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.036
Now, we're assuming that
the gun was pointed up,

13:23.070 --> 13:24.104
not exactly vertical? Okay.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.005
So that'll give us

13:25.038 --> 13:25.906
a radius of...

13:25.939 --> 13:28.041
PENFIELD:
Two to three thousand feet.

13:28.075 --> 13:29.576
Roughly half a mile.

13:29.609 --> 13:32.145
Only there are a lot of
assumptions built into

13:32.179 --> 13:34.982
these calculations, but I
suppose that can't be helped.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.884
Agent Sinclair,

13:36.917 --> 13:39.987
Agent Granger,
this is Dr. Penfield.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.422
Sorry to interrupt.

13:42.455 --> 13:43.891
I just heard the familiar

13:43.924 --> 13:44.892
staccato clacking of chalk,

13:44.925 --> 13:47.160
I thought it might be
something interesting.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.929
You're still coming
to my presentation, right?

13:48.962 --> 13:52.165
I might get something wrong
about Hermitian random matrices.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.867
You know, I've moved on

13:53.901 --> 13:56.236
to sequences
with orthogonal symmetry, man.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.905
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.873
Well, that's funny, 'cause
that's the exact same thing.

13:59.907 --> 14:02.075
Resonances in quantum
chaotic systems.

14:02.109 --> 14:03.610
That's a simplistic analysis.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.146
PENFIELD: You always were testy
when challenged.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.181
You know, I was talking
about that with Amita, um...

14:08.215 --> 14:09.216
You were, were you?

14:09.249 --> 14:12.519
Yeah, yeah, last night.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.621
We were hanging out, you
know, got a little dinner,

14:14.654 --> 14:17.457
long conversation-- that doesn't
bother you, does it?

14:17.490 --> 14:21.028
Marshall, do whatever you like.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.964
Just you remember,
Amita's a sharp mathematician.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.199
So no matter how hard you try,

14:26.233 --> 14:31.471
you're never gonna get her to
believe that this is six inches.

14:31.504 --> 14:35.042
I bet with you
that subject's never come up.

14:36.109 --> 14:39.079
Ooh, math fight.

14:39.112 --> 14:42.215
Hey, that was carjacking
victim number three.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.683
Just like in the home invasions,

14:43.716 --> 14:45.185
these robbers
targeted specific items.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.620
They went right for
his watch, which was

14:47.654 --> 14:48.655
hidden underneath his jacket.

14:48.688 --> 14:51.291
Carjacking victim number two
they made give up

14:51.324 --> 14:52.559
a $55,000 ring.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.194
All right, so they're
being followed, right?

14:54.227 --> 14:56.029
- Forced to pull over.
- No, no.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.531
Carjacking victim number one
locked her keys in her car.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.200
She called AAA
on her cell phone,

15:00.233 --> 15:02.202
and ten minutes later,
these guys showed up.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.004
Victim number two got lost,

15:04.037 --> 15:07.074
entered the destination
into her navigation system.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.176
And victim number three
ran out of gas.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.377
He called his

15:10.410 --> 15:12.645
onboard assistance service
and spoke to a real operator,

15:12.679 --> 15:16.549
but the robbers got there first
with a can of gas.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.119
It's like they're eavesdropping

15:19.152 --> 15:20.220
on their cell phones
or something.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.221
Maybe, but that doesn't explain

15:21.254 --> 15:23.090
their knowledge of their
personal possessions.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.492
And they all have different
cell phone carriers.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.961
I mean, they're tapping
into them somehow, right?

15:27.995 --> 15:28.828
Yeah.

15:28.861 --> 15:31.498
The question is,
what's the common link?

15:34.067 --> 15:36.136
Just don't push the wrong
button or else we'll be

15:36.169 --> 15:38.205
looking for that bullet
the old-fashioned way.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.273
It's okay, all right,
Charlie's already programmed

15:40.307 --> 15:43.610
the trajectory equations
into the calculator.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.512
Yeah, we have the origin point
of the shot.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.746
The equations will generate

15:46.779 --> 15:49.049
high probability areas
for a search.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.751
It's you plugging in those
variables that has me worried.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.021
Hey, man, it's only
two variables, okay?

15:54.054 --> 15:54.954
We got muzzle velocity

15:54.988 --> 15:56.456
and inclination
of the weapon when fired.

15:56.489 --> 15:57.524
I can handle it.

15:57.557 --> 16:00.460
At least I've used
a graphing calculator before.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.761
Really? You have?

16:01.794 --> 16:03.096
High school, man.

16:03.130 --> 16:03.963
Why? You didn't?

16:03.997 --> 16:06.233
I went to high school
in the Bronx.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.203
Get your gear. We found Roley.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.171
He's the fence that sold

16:11.204 --> 16:13.073
that stolen lamp
to the antique store, right?

16:13.106 --> 16:15.142
Yeah, we're setting up a buy.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.178
Hey, Charlie.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.312
Hey.

16:19.346 --> 16:20.413
What's going on?

16:20.447 --> 16:23.283
I was doing my work from
my, uh, city planning days.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.784
See, I'm taking it all down

16:24.817 --> 16:28.321
to the offices that
we're leasing now.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.690
You're really starting
a consulting company

16:30.723 --> 16:31.691
with Stan Fischer, huh?

16:31.724 --> 16:33.660
Why not? You know, I miss work.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.596
Now I can be my own boss and
I can concentrate on the aspects

16:36.629 --> 16:39.732
of design and planning
that I always enjoyed, myself.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.134
It's a big investment.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.470
Oh... I have money.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.238
Thanks to you buying this house

16:45.272 --> 16:46.339
at the asking price.

16:46.373 --> 16:47.707
So you're not worried
about the risk?

16:47.740 --> 16:48.708
( grunts )

16:48.741 --> 16:50.643
Well, that's business.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.645
In fact, that's life.

16:54.647 --> 16:57.117
You know, I never really
wanted to retire.

16:57.150 --> 17:04.391
But when your mother got sick,
there really wasn't much choice.

17:04.424 --> 17:07.227
And now, I have a choice.

17:07.260 --> 17:10.230
I'm really happy for you, Dad.

17:13.166 --> 17:17.070
You okay?

17:17.104 --> 17:21.174
You seem a little,
uh... stressed.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.109
Yeah.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.678
Why? What's wrong?

17:25.712 --> 17:30.483
Marshall Penfield,
fellow Princeton graduate,

17:30.517 --> 17:34.554
has come here to rip apart
five years of my work.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.289
And it's made me realize

17:36.323 --> 17:39.592
that I haven't focused on
anything new since then.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.429
I've been wasting my time
with this stuff for Don.

17:42.462 --> 17:43.496
Oh, come on.

17:43.530 --> 17:46.133
You don't mean
wasting your time.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.267
You're right, I don't.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.769
I'm not wasting my time,
I'm just...

17:49.802 --> 17:52.172
so easily distracted.

17:52.205 --> 17:55.408
Yeah, well, it's more like,
you're easily fascinated.

17:55.442 --> 17:58.245
I need to devote myself
to something significant

17:58.278 --> 18:03.683
in my field-- important
to other mathematicians.

18:03.716 --> 18:06.253
Yeah, well, you know
what I think, Charlie?

18:06.286 --> 18:09.256
I think your life's work should
be what you find important.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.378
Are you the lady

18:31.411 --> 18:32.579
Jay sent over from his store?

18:32.612 --> 18:33.646
Yeah.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.715
He said you get him
some of his best inventory.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.585
I'm Roley.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.387
- This here's Timmy.
- Hi.

18:40.420 --> 18:43.490
Sorry to make you come out so
late, but you know how it is.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.492
Oh, I've been
to worse neighborhoods.

18:50.830 --> 18:54.801
So, let's see if we could
do a little business.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.169
You, uh, brought money, right?

18:56.203 --> 18:57.737
Oh, I brought better than money.

18:57.770 --> 19:00.173
AGENTS:
FBI! FBI!

19:01.241 --> 19:02.742
Get down!

19:02.775 --> 19:03.910
FBI!

19:03.943 --> 19:05.245
You stop right there! Stop!

19:05.278 --> 19:06.446
Drop on your knees!

19:06.479 --> 19:07.580
Hands behind your head!

19:17.590 --> 19:19.359
You know where this
came from, right?

19:19.392 --> 19:21.461
I'm really not one to ask that
many questions.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.161
No? Maybe you ought to

19:22.195 --> 19:23.963
rub it three times and find out

19:23.996 --> 19:25.432
where it's about to send you.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.508
This is a list
of everything that was

19:35.542 --> 19:36.209
in your storage unit.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.245
And this is a list of everything

19:38.278 --> 19:40.513
that was stolen
from seven home invasions.

19:40.547 --> 19:41.948
They're kind of similar.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.383
I had no part of that.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.818
Having this stuff makes you

19:45.852 --> 19:47.420
- a part of that.
- I'm telling you,

19:47.454 --> 19:49.356
I am not that kind of guy.

19:49.389 --> 19:50.657
You got a nice painting

19:50.690 --> 19:52.559
or a good piece
of period furniture,

19:52.592 --> 19:53.493
I can find you a buyer.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.462
Who's not gonna ask
too many questions.

19:55.495 --> 19:56.396
That's right.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.498
I find people with money

19:58.531 --> 20:00.867
who are interested
in deals on luxury items.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.535
That's my niche.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.671
Killing? Not my niche.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.539
Well, how'd you get
all this stuff?

20:06.573 --> 20:09.676
It wasn't from any crew,
it was just... it was two guys.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.879
And how'd you meet them?

20:12.912 --> 20:15.348
They came up to me at a bar,

20:15.382 --> 20:18.851
said they knew me by reputation.

20:18.885 --> 20:23.523
And what makes you think
that these guys aren't robbers?

20:23.556 --> 20:26.593
One of them was dressed
better than my lawyer.

20:26.626 --> 20:30.497
And the other guy,
he was just a total geek.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.499
I'm gonna need their names.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.534
Mr. Brown, Mr. Gray.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.536
( chuckles )

20:36.569 --> 20:38.271
That's all I know.

20:38.305 --> 20:41.007
Then I feel sorry
for you, Roley.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.443
Wait a minute.

20:43.476 --> 20:44.911
All right, these guys,

20:44.944 --> 20:48.415
they're not
barehanders, all right?

20:48.448 --> 20:49.482
They're way too business.

20:49.516 --> 20:50.350
How so?

20:50.383 --> 20:51.618
For one thing, they gave me a
list,

20:51.651 --> 20:52.819
like this one.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.722
With everything they were
gonna bring me weeks in advance.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.491
Said it was so I could
locate buyers ahead of time.

20:58.525 --> 20:59.426
MEGAN:
Roley's description of the men

20:59.459 --> 21:02.662
he dealt with don't match
what we have.

21:02.695 --> 21:05.532
So then, we could be looking
for five different guys?

21:05.565 --> 21:06.999
Maybe not five different guys,

21:07.033 --> 21:09.936
but maybe two guys that case it
and three guys that do

21:09.969 --> 21:11.338
the actual robbery.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.640
I'm telling you,
the cell phones tie into it.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.642
Yeah, but every single person
uses a different service.

21:15.675 --> 21:17.544
And how would they know
what's in the homes?

21:17.577 --> 21:18.778
And what about the data mining?

21:18.811 --> 21:19.646
I'm working it.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.514
The analysis finds
all kinds of links

21:21.548 --> 21:23.383
and I have to gauge which
ones are meaningful.

21:23.416 --> 21:24.617
For instance, the
data mining found

21:24.651 --> 21:25.852
that all the victims
buy bottled water.

21:25.885 --> 21:26.986
Well, that's meaningless.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.622
CHARLIE: When Army intelligence
tried to use data mining

21:29.656 --> 21:30.757
to spot commonalities
between terrorist attacks,

21:30.790 --> 21:33.560
one of the people it picked out
was Condoleezza Rice.

21:33.593 --> 21:36.363
Okay, so it's thorough,
but it's not discriminating?

21:36.396 --> 21:37.630
Whatever you can do, Charlie.

21:37.664 --> 21:40.533
You're the one who said we're
talking about three days here.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.702
- Yeah, I know.
- No pressure.

22:05.892 --> 22:08.094
DAVID: A variable two-way muzzle
velocity.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.562
We're working with
a nine millimeter,

22:09.596 --> 22:11.464
but these guys
like to play rough.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.400
Now, I'm thinking they're
packing something stronger.

22:13.433 --> 22:14.734
Yeah, but muzzle
velocity changes

22:14.767 --> 22:16.503
with the grain
of the bullet, anyway.

22:16.536 --> 22:17.504
The heavier
the projectile,

22:17.537 --> 22:18.137
the slower it goes.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.138
Right.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.507
Okay, let's just say,

22:20.540 --> 22:21.774
you're a guy into
invading people's homes,

22:21.808 --> 22:23.610
and you're getting off
on messing them up.

22:23.643 --> 22:24.377
Right.

22:24.411 --> 22:25.077
What's your
weapon of choice?

22:25.111 --> 22:27.113
Semi-automatic with a big clip.

22:27.146 --> 22:28.448
Lots of stopping power.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.983
.45 ACP,
180 grain rounds.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.719
That's a muzzle velocity
of 1,200 feet per second.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.454
Oh, yeah, man,

22:34.487 --> 22:35.422
plug that one in.

22:37.624 --> 22:40.993
The development of any type
of representation theory

22:41.027 --> 22:43.430
is usually split
into two stages.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.532
The first is a description

22:45.565 --> 22:46.633
of all elementary
representations.

22:46.666 --> 22:49.436
The second consists
of constructing

22:49.469 --> 22:51.971
certain natural representations
of the group,

22:52.004 --> 22:54.907
and decomposing them
into irreducible ones.

22:54.941 --> 22:59.045
What we see when we get deeper
into the Eppes Convergence,

22:59.078 --> 23:03.450
is a small and, until now,
undetectable

23:03.483 --> 23:05.418
conceptual roadblock.

23:05.452 --> 23:07.454
It's an expression,

23:07.487 --> 23:13.059
floating through these equations
like a tiny blood clot,

23:13.092 --> 23:15.728
until it lands here,

23:15.762 --> 23:19.065
at the infinite-dimensional
simplex,

23:19.098 --> 23:23.636
which causes a stroke
to the entire theory.

23:28.475 --> 23:30.677
Maybe these guys are
into revolvers.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.512
You know,
a nice little .38,

23:32.545 --> 23:34.514
or a .357, maybe.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.483
I'm telling you, man,
they're physical,

23:36.516 --> 23:37.817
they're pumped,
they're flush with cash.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.051
These guys buy a gun,

23:39.085 --> 23:42.188
it's going to be
a .40 caliber 45 hk.

23:42.221 --> 23:44.591
David, we can talk muzzle
velocities all day long.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.058
But if this joker
fired straight up,

23:46.092 --> 23:47.660
it doesn't matter,

23:47.694 --> 23:49.228
because the bullet would have
landed right here,

23:49.261 --> 23:50.630
within a 50-foot radius

23:50.663 --> 23:51.898
of where
the guy fired from.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.533
So, the question is:

23:53.566 --> 23:56.102
do you think it's possible
that he actually fired straight?

23:56.135 --> 23:58.004
Yup, I do think it's possible.

23:58.037 --> 23:59.839
Yeah? Based on what?

23:59.872 --> 24:02.942
Based on I just found
the bullet.

24:08.648 --> 24:09.816
Charlie?

24:09.849 --> 24:11.718
He does have
a valid point

24:11.751 --> 24:15.021
about the end-point process
on the one-dimensional lattice.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.923
Right.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.525
Penfield's blood clot

24:18.558 --> 24:19.859
to my brain.

24:19.892 --> 24:22.161
Or was it the torpedo
in the engine room analogy?

24:22.194 --> 24:23.796
I forget.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.965
Hey, Amita,
there you are.

24:25.998 --> 24:28.067
You still up
for Pie n' Burger?

24:28.100 --> 24:29.736
Sure, let me grab my stuff.

24:30.703 --> 24:31.871
Hey, Eppesy.

24:31.904 --> 24:34.807
Heard you got
a substance abuse problem

24:34.841 --> 24:35.808
with lemon meringue.

24:35.842 --> 24:37.677
It's a "gateway" pie, you know.

24:37.710 --> 24:40.146
Why don't you
come meet us out front?

24:40.179 --> 24:41.748
You know,
there's a whole crowd

24:41.781 --> 24:42.715
of people going.

24:42.749 --> 24:43.650
I'll pass.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.761
What's the matter?

24:54.794 --> 24:57.797
I can't make any headway
on this FBI case.

24:57.830 --> 25:02.835
And... there's my life's work...

25:02.869 --> 25:04.270
going up in flames.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.741
Well, you're spreading yourself
really thin.

25:08.775 --> 25:11.243
You're spending a lot of time
with Marshall.

25:11.277 --> 25:13.980
He's an interesting thinker.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.782
It's not a big deal, Charlie.

25:15.815 --> 25:18.284
You've got
your FBI work,

25:18.317 --> 25:19.852
your teaching,
your research...

25:19.886 --> 25:21.888
Yeah, and you've got
your astrophysics work,

25:21.921 --> 25:23.790
your work with Dr. Keppler.

25:23.823 --> 25:24.791
I know.

25:24.824 --> 25:27.827
I'm focused on my work.

25:27.860 --> 25:32.298
I'm not sure that I want to
focus myself socially right now.

25:32.331 --> 25:34.233
I guess I can understand that.

25:39.071 --> 25:40.840
You sure you don't want
some pie?

25:40.873 --> 25:42.241
No, I...

25:42.274 --> 25:43.242
Go eat pie.

25:43.275 --> 25:44.010
Please.

25:44.043 --> 25:44.944
I need to think.

25:45.878 --> 25:46.779
Okay.

26:00.092 --> 26:02.962
Do you two realize
what's in here?

26:02.995 --> 26:03.763
Well, in your case,

26:03.796 --> 26:04.997
a lot of unanswered
voice mails.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.098
I can tell you that.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.601
After 9/11,
the FCC mandated

26:08.635 --> 26:10.970
that all cell phones
be able to locate people

26:11.003 --> 26:12.038
in the event of an emergency.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.039
Oh, right.

26:13.072 --> 26:13.840
That a GPS locator chip

26:13.873 --> 26:15.742
has to be put
in every new phone

26:15.775 --> 26:16.709
by 2005.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.611
And newer phones
can be used to track people

26:18.645 --> 26:19.812
within a range of 30 feet.

26:19.846 --> 26:22.815
But you're still going to need
access to classified data.

26:22.849 --> 26:24.250
Are you saying
that these robbers

26:24.283 --> 26:26.919
have figured out how to
intercept encrypted material

26:26.953 --> 26:28.054
from a military
satellite?

26:28.087 --> 26:29.756
No, that's impossible.

26:29.789 --> 26:33.259
Listen, somehow they've gotten
that GPS information.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.294
They've gotten
into the phones.

26:35.327 --> 26:37.163
But that doesn't explain
how they knew who to rob.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.666
Look, this is
a two-part problem, okay?

26:39.699 --> 26:41.333
Part one: How do they know who
to rob?

26:41.367 --> 26:44.771
And part two: How do they know
where the victims are?

26:44.804 --> 26:46.005
The phone is the key
to part two--

26:46.038 --> 26:47.006
locating victims.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.841
Part one:
how they know

26:48.875 --> 26:50.843
who owns what,
I still can't tell you.

26:50.877 --> 26:51.978
But you can be positive

26:52.011 --> 26:54.881
that all the families
will have it in common.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.685
ALAN: Hey, Charlie, you seen my
cell phone?

26:58.718 --> 27:00.953
I been looking all over for it,
I can't find...

27:00.987 --> 27:02.388
What are you
doing with it?

27:02.421 --> 27:04.290
We'll put it back together.

27:05.257 --> 27:06.225
You can't use

27:06.258 --> 27:07.259
one of
your own?

27:07.293 --> 27:08.761
LARRY: Well, I refused to allow

27:08.795 --> 27:10.830
the small, quiet moments
of my life

27:10.863 --> 27:13.733
to be invaded by these
devices of distraction.

27:13.766 --> 27:14.901
Which means

27:14.934 --> 27:16.035
you don't
have one?

27:16.068 --> 27:17.436
And I need mine.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.938
Look, Charlie,
I'm not a homebound

27:18.971 --> 27:19.806
retiree anymore.

27:19.839 --> 27:20.807
I happen to be starting
a new business.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.008
And having a cell phone might
come in handy.

27:22.041 --> 27:22.909
Right?

27:22.942 --> 27:24.944
Look, you'll have it back
in one hour.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.879
Dad, we need to look
at your GPS chip.

27:26.913 --> 27:28.114
What do you need
to do that for?

27:28.147 --> 27:29.916
Every new phone

27:29.949 --> 27:32.051
comes embedded
with this tiny chip

27:32.084 --> 27:34.020
that acts as
a global positioning receiver.

27:34.053 --> 27:35.955
And it's
my theory

27:35.988 --> 27:37.056
that these
home-invasion robbers

27:37.089 --> 27:38.891
are using them
to track their victims.

27:38.925 --> 27:40.693
How would they do it?

27:40.727 --> 27:43.195
Well, a cell phone's
essentially a radio.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.798
Whenever it's on,
it's sending radio signals

27:45.832 --> 27:48.067
to let cell towers know
where the phone is

27:48.100 --> 27:51.103
so a person can move
from one cell zone to another

27:51.137 --> 27:52.839
without losing a call.

27:52.872 --> 27:53.906
At the same time,

27:53.940 --> 27:57.076
the GPS chip receives signals
from outer space,

27:57.109 --> 28:01.180
specifically, from at least
three geosynchronous satellites.

28:01.213 --> 28:02.114
Using the geometric method

28:02.148 --> 28:04.483
called "three-dimensional
trilateration,"

28:04.516 --> 28:06.919
the GPS chip uses
the signals from the satellites

28:06.953 --> 28:10.256
to calculate
its exact location on Earth.

28:10.289 --> 28:12.491
The data generated
can be used by police,

28:12.524 --> 28:14.994
roadside assistance,
emergency services,

28:15.027 --> 28:16.195
tracking truck fleets--

28:16.228 --> 28:19.031
and even lets parents keep tabs
on their teenage children.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.733
Ah, it's too
"Big Brother" for me.

28:20.767 --> 28:22.468
I'll stick with
my rotary dial-up.

28:22.501 --> 28:24.470
But intercepting these signals
is really

28:24.503 --> 28:26.773
beyond the grasp
of most criminals.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.741
ALAN: If all my years of working

28:28.775 --> 28:30.076
at Urban Infrastructure
has taught me anything,

28:30.109 --> 28:31.744
it's that
there's always somebody

28:31.778 --> 28:33.145
who gets into the system.

28:33.179 --> 28:38.017
MEGAN: Charlie was right. Three
days on the button.

28:38.050 --> 28:41.120
Married couple,
74 and 77 years old.

28:41.153 --> 28:42.221
From the evidence,
it looks like

28:42.254 --> 28:44.123
the man struggled
with the robbers.

28:44.156 --> 28:44.824
DON: Yeah, they beat him to
death,

28:44.857 --> 28:46.025
they got
the woman over here.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.027
They strangled her.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.963
Doesn't look like
they put up much of a fight.

28:50.997 --> 28:52.464
MEGAN: They're acting more
frequently,

28:52.498 --> 28:54.466
and killing
more readily.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.008
I am crossing my fingers
that this has to be

29:02.041 --> 29:03.009
the bullet
from the carjacking.

29:03.042 --> 29:04.010
DAVID:
Not a lot of bullets

29:04.043 --> 29:05.244
lying around Brentwood.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.213
No, it's more of a
slash-your-throat

29:07.246 --> 29:08.514
kind of neighborhood.

29:08.547 --> 29:09.816
Well, we're
running the slug

29:09.849 --> 29:11.851
through the ATF
Bullet Trap database,

29:11.884 --> 29:13.953
hoping to match the gun
it was fired from

29:13.986 --> 29:15.254
to a previous crime.

29:16.522 --> 29:18.090
We need this lead.

29:18.124 --> 29:20.126
And after eight hits,

29:20.159 --> 29:21.293
they're going to think
they're invincible.

29:21.327 --> 29:24.230
That we can't
catch them.

29:24.263 --> 29:25.297
They're going to be
more reckless,

29:25.331 --> 29:26.966
more dangerous.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.069
Bingo.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.538
LARRY:
Yeah, I heard on the radio--

29:32.571 --> 29:34.006
two more people killed

29:34.040 --> 29:35.374
by these robbers
Don is trying to catch.

29:35.407 --> 29:37.076
Yeah. It's bad.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.378
And the data mining is not
yielding any connections

29:39.411 --> 29:40.379
you can work with?

29:40.412 --> 29:41.347
Well, it's hard to say.

29:41.380 --> 29:42.448
You know,
one commonality

29:42.481 --> 29:45.251
that the analysis keeps
highlighting is cell phones.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.385
But, you know,
everyone has cell phones.

29:46.418 --> 29:47.954
Then there's
a second commonality,

29:47.987 --> 29:51.323
that has no defined value.

29:51.357 --> 29:54.026
The algorithm keeps pointing out

29:54.060 --> 29:59.899
that the families all have
rare, collectible items.

29:59.932 --> 30:01.433
And all were insured.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.102
You really should
get this program to Amita.

30:03.135 --> 30:06.038
She is the best coder we've got.

30:06.072 --> 30:07.907
I don't think this is
where the problem is.

30:07.940 --> 30:10.843
And... Amita's off chilling
with Penfield.

30:10.877 --> 30:12.411
Well, he is a brilliant
mathematician

30:12.444 --> 30:14.480
and, I assume,
a sparkling conversationalist.

30:14.513 --> 30:15.481
Are you serious?

30:15.514 --> 30:16.615
Oh, you're great.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.451
You're just another member
of the Penfield Fan Club.

30:19.485 --> 30:20.286
Right?

30:20.319 --> 30:22.154
Well, I do understand
his analysis

30:22.188 --> 30:25.457
of the Eppes Convergence
was a bit pointed.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.326
I'll admit,
he's a bright fellow.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.461
He's got all sorts of insight.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.497
But he's so full of himself.

30:31.530 --> 30:34.500
He's so annoyingly
confident.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.869
"Certainly in extending
the calculation for S

30:36.903 --> 30:39.338
"to the infinite
unitary group,

30:39.371 --> 30:41.874
"it would be obvious
to anyone

30:41.908 --> 30:42.875
"that my genius
would mandate--

30:42.909 --> 30:43.675
"upon my death--

30:43.709 --> 30:45.912
"the inclusion of my brain

30:45.945 --> 30:47.146
in the Smithsonian."

30:47.179 --> 30:49.115
I would actually
prefer

30:49.148 --> 30:50.549
someone take my brain
on a road trip

30:50.582 --> 30:52.151
like they did
with Einstein's.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.085
But...

30:53.920 --> 30:54.887
Hey, Charlie.

30:54.921 --> 30:55.955
Hello.

30:57.223 --> 30:58.024
Charlie, Marshall and I

30:58.057 --> 31:00.426
went to your office
looking for you,

31:00.459 --> 31:02.094
and we kind of saw

31:02.128 --> 31:03.129
what was
on the chalkboard.

31:03.162 --> 31:04.296
( mouths words )

31:04.330 --> 31:05.397
PENFIELD: Yeah, you had a
problem

31:05.431 --> 31:06.465
that was of interest to me

31:06.498 --> 31:09.401
because it relates to
my main field-set theory.

31:09.435 --> 31:10.402
Oh, well...

31:10.436 --> 31:12.071
This is it,
isn't it?

31:12.104 --> 31:14.340
This is the same
thing right here.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.108
Could be.

31:16.142 --> 31:17.977
Why?

31:18.010 --> 31:20.446
Marshall's new research
at Princeton

31:20.479 --> 31:21.413
is inset theory,

31:21.447 --> 31:25.051
in something he calls
"deep current" sets.

31:25.084 --> 31:25.985
What are those?

31:27.453 --> 31:28.420
Chalk.

31:30.489 --> 31:32.158
Connections
between groups

31:32.191 --> 31:33.325
that are
hard to detect,

31:33.359 --> 31:37.496
but that affect
all the other sets.

31:39.065 --> 31:42.001
Kind of like how currents
beneath the ocean surface

31:42.034 --> 31:43.569
can influence
the weather patterns

31:43.602 --> 31:46.005
in the atmosphere.

31:46.038 --> 31:48.407
There's something underneath
we can't see.

31:51.543 --> 31:53.545
Things that seem
to have no connection

31:53.579 --> 31:55.481
are all linked

31:55.514 --> 31:57.083
by a common factor.

31:57.116 --> 31:58.350
Marshall, have
you developed

31:58.384 --> 32:00.586
methods of analysis
to help you define

32:00.619 --> 32:02.054
the unidentified connections?

32:02.088 --> 32:03.555
Oh, yeah, sure.

32:03.589 --> 32:04.723
Even if I can't

32:04.756 --> 32:06.492
tell you
where the deep current is,

32:06.525 --> 32:08.995
I can tell you were to look.

32:10.462 --> 32:13.132
MEGAN: But, Charlie, all eight
families

32:13.165 --> 32:14.733
have different
insurance companies.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.435
Sure, but the data mining
found that there's

32:16.468 --> 32:18.504
a powerful connection
between the victims,

32:18.537 --> 32:20.139
And it's not
something we can see.

32:20.172 --> 32:23.409
It's an unseen set,
a deep current set.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.577
- I'm sure that means something.
- Right.

32:25.611 --> 32:28.480
The victims' families all
had high-end valuables,

32:28.514 --> 32:30.749
Like the Dirk Van Erp lamp that
you guys tracked down, right?

32:30.782 --> 32:33.685
Right, that the robbers
all knew about in advance.

32:33.719 --> 32:35.254
The victims'
families all had

32:35.287 --> 32:38.224
different insurance companies,
but my analysis suggests

32:38.257 --> 32:40.326
that the insurance companies
have something in common.

32:40.359 --> 32:41.460
Like what?

32:41.493 --> 32:44.630
Well, apparently, when covering
rare, high-cost items,

32:44.663 --> 32:46.698
insurance companies
often purchase a rider,

32:46.732 --> 32:49.635
a backup policy
from another firm.

32:49.668 --> 32:51.437
Yeah, insurance riders,
of course...

32:51.470 --> 32:54.373
which wouldn't show up
on a criminal report,

32:54.406 --> 32:57.009
because the customers
don't even know they have them!

32:57.043 --> 32:59.145
Colby, Charlie's got
a good idea-- check out if any

32:59.178 --> 33:00.779
of the insurance carriers bought
any riders from the same firm.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.481
CHARLIE: If I'm right, you'll
find a company

33:02.514 --> 33:03.515
common to
several victims.

33:03.549 --> 33:04.383
And someone with access

33:04.416 --> 33:05.451
to that company's
list of clients...

33:05.484 --> 33:07.786
...would know how to hack
into cell phone signals.

33:07.819 --> 33:10.089
Megan, get a list of local
employees with criminal records

33:10.122 --> 33:11.090
from the wireless companies.

33:11.123 --> 33:12.591
- All right?
- I have that.

33:12.624 --> 33:13.625
Very fast.

33:13.659 --> 33:14.993
Thank you.

33:18.264 --> 33:20.666
Don, I already looked
at three of them.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.401
They used
the same underwriter.

33:22.434 --> 33:23.702
It's a BTL, Limited,
so I'm gonna check,

33:23.735 --> 33:25.171
see if I can get
employee lists.

33:25.204 --> 33:26.038
DON: Good. Great.

33:26.072 --> 33:27.439
Now, compare that list
to Megan's list,

33:27.473 --> 33:28.574
and maybe we'll find one guy

33:28.607 --> 33:29.708
on both.

33:29.741 --> 33:33.045
No, we're looking for two guys,
Mr. Brown, and Mr. Gray.

33:33.079 --> 33:34.313
Remember, one will know
cell phones,

33:34.346 --> 33:36.082
one's gonna know insurance.

33:36.115 --> 33:38.550
This is the FBI's version
of data mining,

33:38.584 --> 33:40.452
finding links the
old-fashioned way.

33:40.486 --> 33:42.588
Oh, yeah, by hand
and by luck.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.590
Here we go, Herbert Quilty,

33:44.623 --> 33:46.692
service tech for
Vertech Wireless.

33:46.725 --> 33:49.261
Two years ago, pled
guilty to selling

33:49.295 --> 33:50.662
stolen cell phones,

33:50.696 --> 33:51.830
served three months
in county gail.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.832
What's his link
to the insurance company?

33:53.865 --> 33:57.203
Same time as Quilty was in jail,
a guy named Thomas Maynard

33:57.236 --> 33:59.371
was serving weekends
on a DUI conviction,

33:59.405 --> 34:01.140
Maynard was a
supervisor

34:01.173 --> 34:02.508
at BTL Underwriters.

34:02.541 --> 34:03.575
How did Roley put it?

34:03.609 --> 34:04.810
"One dresses
better than my lawyer,

34:04.843 --> 34:06.278
- Right.
- and one is a total geek."

34:15.754 --> 34:16.688
Freeze!

34:16.722 --> 34:18.390
Hands behind your head!
Down on your knees!

34:18.424 --> 34:20.526
Down!

34:22.694 --> 34:24.630
Herbert Quilty,
you're under arrest for murder.

34:24.663 --> 34:26.498
All right.

34:26.532 --> 34:27.766
I had that wine
at Morton's

34:27.799 --> 34:28.734
last week.

34:30.836 --> 34:32.671
FBI! Get on the ground!

34:32.704 --> 34:33.639
On your knees!

34:33.672 --> 34:34.740
Down!

34:34.773 --> 34:35.541
Okay!

34:35.574 --> 34:37.409
Hands behind
your back, Maynard!

34:39.611 --> 34:42.148
You're working with some
nasty dudes, Maynard.

34:42.181 --> 34:43.849
Where'd you meet
guys like this?

34:43.882 --> 34:47.119
Weekend lockup seems a bit tame
for stone killers.

34:47.153 --> 34:49.855
No evidence connects me
to any crimes.

34:49.888 --> 34:54.593
Can't control these guys,
can you?

34:54.626 --> 34:57.729
Thought you were getting
into the robbery business.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.198
They switched the game on you,
didn't they?

35:03.169 --> 35:07.239
You set it up so they
could stalk their victims,

35:07.273 --> 35:08.474
in their homes,

35:08.507 --> 35:09.475
in their cars.

35:09.508 --> 35:10.576
That puts you right

35:10.609 --> 35:11.710
in the middle of things.

35:11.743 --> 35:14.146
Walter Gordon.

35:14.180 --> 35:16.615
His friends
call him "Demento."

35:16.648 --> 35:19.785
Leader of a San Fernando Valley
skinhead gang.

35:19.818 --> 35:21.453
Hmm?

35:21.487 --> 35:23.422
Never seen him before
in my life.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.824
Yes, you have.

35:25.857 --> 35:27.593
What happens to you now?

35:27.626 --> 35:29.561
What do you think
he's gonna do to you

35:29.595 --> 35:31.930
the next time the two of
you run into each other?

35:31.963 --> 35:33.632
And what about
your family?

35:33.665 --> 35:38.637
If you're locked up,
and he's still out there?

35:38.670 --> 35:41.773
They weren't supposed
to hurt anyone.

35:41.807 --> 35:45.844
That's all on them.

35:46.945 --> 35:49.448
I picked people
from the company files.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.849
Quilty rigged the phones.

35:50.882 --> 35:52.851
With GPS to the node signal.

35:52.884 --> 35:54.620
MAYNARD:
Demento's crazy.

35:54.653 --> 35:57.423
I tried to keep him
to a schedule,

35:57.456 --> 35:58.857
but he wanted to move
faster and faster

35:58.890 --> 36:00.592
He decided to pull
these carjackings.

36:00.626 --> 36:04.730
Said he wanted to be known
for selling expensive wheels.

36:04.763 --> 36:06.732
Nice timing
on the photo.

36:06.765 --> 36:08.667
DAVID: Forensics matched the
bullet we found in Brentwood

36:08.700 --> 36:11.703
to one shot through the head of
a fast food worker in Tarzana

36:11.737 --> 36:12.871
about two years ago.

36:12.904 --> 36:16.675
Witness in that case ID'd
Walter Gordon, aka Demento.

36:16.708 --> 36:17.709
MEGAN: What I don't understand

36:17.743 --> 36:19.911
is how did Quilty's phone
let the robbers know

36:19.945 --> 36:21.613
- where track victims were?
- Well...

36:21.647 --> 36:24.750
Quilty must have put
a sniffer on a node.

36:24.783 --> 36:26.918
A node is something that takes
all the calls coming into

36:26.952 --> 36:28.954
a cell tower and then
relays those signals

36:28.987 --> 36:30.222
to where they're going.

36:30.256 --> 36:32.791
A sniffer is an
electronic device

36:32.824 --> 36:35.861
that detects specific calls,
then sends that signal

36:35.894 --> 36:37.563
to a phone the robbers
must have.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.465
And you think Quilty's phone
could do that?

36:39.498 --> 36:40.832
I think so.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.634
All he needed was access
to the cell towers.

36:42.668 --> 36:44.736
Because he worked at a wireless
company, he had that.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.805
CHARLIE: And the gear required,
well, he could buy that

36:46.838 --> 36:47.839
at any electronics
store, couldn't he?

36:47.873 --> 36:50.742
All right, So Maynard gave
Quilty phone numbers

36:50.776 --> 36:51.977
of people
who owned valuable things.

36:52.010 --> 36:53.879
Right, and Quilty
had his sniffer search

36:53.912 --> 36:54.980
for those numbers.

36:55.013 --> 36:56.181
When those signals came in,

36:56.214 --> 36:59.551
the locations went to the phone
that he gave the robbers.

36:59.585 --> 37:03.021
They could follow victims,
move in as they arrived home.

37:03.054 --> 37:06.558
Walter Gordon, aka Demento,
has no known address.

37:06.592 --> 37:09.261
LAPD's been looking for him
since the Tarzana killing.

37:09.295 --> 37:12.831
Okay, so Maynard and Quilty
set up Gordon with phone numbers

37:12.864 --> 37:13.865
of potential victims.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.334
See if they picked
any new victims.

37:15.367 --> 37:16.368
I mean, if we can't

37:16.402 --> 37:18.404
find Gordon, let's find out
where he's going.

37:23.509 --> 37:25.677
Come on, take me
to your home.

37:25.711 --> 37:26.778
( loading clip )

37:26.812 --> 37:28.980
DEMENTO:
There's the Volvo.

37:29.014 --> 37:30.882
SKINHEAD: This family won't
know what hit them.

37:52.471 --> 37:53.639
( tires screeching )

37:55.841 --> 37:56.908
I got the driver,
you get the girl!

37:56.942 --> 37:58.510
Out of the damn car!

37:58.544 --> 37:59.711
Get out of
the car now!

37:59.745 --> 38:00.746
Get out of the car!

38:00.779 --> 38:01.613
Drop the gun!

38:01.647 --> 38:02.748
Drop it!

38:02.781 --> 38:04.750
( agents all yelling )

38:04.783 --> 38:06.418
Don't move!

38:06.452 --> 38:07.519
Get your hands
behind your back!

38:08.987 --> 38:10.088
( skinhead grunts )

38:10.121 --> 38:11.623
( grunts )

38:11.657 --> 38:13.325
Get him up.

38:13.359 --> 38:14.393
Ow!

38:14.426 --> 38:15.461
What the hell is that?

38:15.494 --> 38:16.528
MEGAN:
Shut up,

38:16.562 --> 38:18.530
Can't you see
the baby's sleeping?

38:20.732 --> 38:22.934
CHARLIE:
Marshall.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.135
Eppesy.

38:24.169 --> 38:26.772
I just thought you might like
to know that your insight

38:26.805 --> 38:28.774
on the subset commonality
helped the FBI

38:28.807 --> 38:30.776
catch three murderers.

38:30.809 --> 38:31.677
Wow.

38:31.710 --> 38:32.944
That's, uh...

38:32.978 --> 38:34.646
That's, that's great.

38:34.680 --> 38:37.549
So, thank you
for your help.

38:37.583 --> 38:39.851
You're welcome.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.656
I hope you understand,
I didn't work

38:44.690 --> 38:49.361
on the Eppes Convergence
because of you.

38:49.395 --> 38:51.597
I did because, uh...

38:51.630 --> 38:54.366
Well, because it's
great math.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.768
You know, back
at Princeton,

38:56.802 --> 38:58.737
you were always the guy
with the deep ideas.

38:58.770 --> 39:01.740
This one just
fascinated me.

39:01.773 --> 39:06.645
Well, I have to admit...

39:06.678 --> 39:09.047
your work
shows tremendous insight.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.949
Thanks.

39:10.982 --> 39:14.620
Though I've taken another
look at your analysis

39:14.653 --> 39:16.021
Oh, no, I know
that tone.

39:16.054 --> 39:18.757
And I think I've found a way

39:18.790 --> 39:22.494
to address the flaw
that you've identified.

39:30.936 --> 39:34.540
That's the basic idea.

39:34.573 --> 39:38.777
That negates the whole need
for the flawed section, then.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.846
How about that?

39:40.879 --> 39:43.114
Great Professor Charlie Eppes
has done it again.

39:43.148 --> 39:44.950
Now, that's hokum.

39:44.983 --> 39:48.787
This approach was only apparent
because of your work.

39:48.820 --> 39:52.658
So I'm going to call this
the Penfield Variation.

39:52.691 --> 39:54.893
( laughs )

39:54.926 --> 39:57.596
Great.

39:57.629 --> 40:00.799
Way to make me feel
like a real ass.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.434
( chuckles )

40:03.835 --> 40:06.638
( knock at door )

40:06.672 --> 40:07.673
ALAN:
Door's open.

40:07.706 --> 40:08.907
Hi, Mr. Eppes.

40:08.940 --> 40:09.975
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:10.008 --> 40:12.077
Charlie's supposed to come
with us to a seminar.

40:12.110 --> 40:14.513
Oh, he's out in the garage.

40:14.546 --> 40:16.748
Hey, Charlie,
your friends...

40:16.782 --> 40:19.718
Here he comes.
Been out in the garage all day.

40:19.751 --> 40:20.886
Hey, guys, you know what?

40:20.919 --> 40:22.488
Go on without me--
maybe I'll catch up

40:22.521 --> 40:23.722
with you later,
'cause I'm a little

40:23.755 --> 40:24.823
caught up
with something right now

40:24.856 --> 40:25.691
What are you working on?

40:25.724 --> 40:28.827
A unified theory
of the neural network

40:28.860 --> 40:30.161
in higher cognitive functions.

40:30.195 --> 40:31.963
LARRY:
The math

40:31.997 --> 40:33.465
of the brain.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.767
I'd better stick to it, too.

40:35.801 --> 40:38.704
It might take me
a while...

40:38.737 --> 40:40.205
Say, several decades.

40:40.238 --> 40:42.608
Attaboy.

40:43.909 --> 40:46.645
Yeah, what is it
they say?

40:46.678 --> 40:48.179
"The journey is more important
than the destination?"

40:48.213 --> 40:50.015
So true.

40:50.048 --> 40:51.917
You're doing a jigsaw puzzle.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.586
Oh, yeah, it's 5,000 pieces.

40:54.620 --> 40:55.987
My wife used to do them
all the time.

40:59.124 --> 41:01.793
So what do you say
you skip the seminar,

41:01.827 --> 41:02.761
and we'll order in some pizza?

41:02.794 --> 41:05.931
I love jigsaw puzzles.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.866
And I love pizza.

41:07.899 --> 41:12.638
All right.

41:12.671 --> 41:16.708
( upbeat music playing )
