WEBVTT

00:39.664 --> 00:41.916
I can't believe I'm actually holding it.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.669
<i>Commander Canada</i> number 43.

00:44.753 --> 00:47.213
First appearance
of his maple syrup blasters!

00:47.297 --> 00:48.840
And it's ours.

00:50.425 --> 00:51.718
So how do we do this?

00:51.801 --> 00:54.554
Is it like a joint custody thing
where I get it on weekends?

00:54.679 --> 00:56.765
'Cause obviously, you get it for more time
'cause you paid for it,

00:56.848 --> 00:58.475
but I wanna be a part of its life too,
you know?

00:58.558 --> 00:59.642
I'll help you care for it.

00:59.726 --> 01:00.810
It's not a baby, Mason.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.645
Oh, but it is, Sam.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.897
It's our baby.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.231
You're an idiot.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.650
Oh, hey, guys.

01:07.734 --> 01:08.777
Tommy.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.403
What are we up to today?

01:13.656 --> 01:14.991
Give it back!

01:17.660 --> 01:19.412
<i>Commander Canada</i>?

01:19.496 --> 01:20.580
Seriously?

01:24.084 --> 01:25.376
You can't read it, it's mint!

01:25.460 --> 01:26.795
It's mint?

01:28.630 --> 01:30.298
Now it's pave-mint.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.676
No!

01:33.760 --> 01:35.470
Thanks, man.

01:35.553 --> 01:37.597
-Oh.

01:47.065 --> 01:50.276
I wish Commander Canada would send
that guy to another dimension.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.528
I'm sorry, man.

01:52.278 --> 01:55.365
I know how much that comic
meant to you, and your dad.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.743
Gee, I can't believe
it's been almost a year--

01:58.827 --> 02:00.537
Can we not talk about it?

02:00.620 --> 02:02.539
Yeah, sorry, sorry. I didn't--

02:02.622 --> 02:04.415
It's all good.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.007
Sam?

02:13.091 --> 02:14.134
Sorry.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.886
I was at the store with Mason,
and we just...

02:16.970 --> 02:19.139
I, I just lost track of time.

02:19.222 --> 02:23.017
Sam, I, I told you I wanted us
to start having dinners again.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.186
We need to get back
to some kind of normal.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.896
I don't wanna be normal.

02:28.064 --> 02:29.691
Stop trying to make me forget him.

02:29.774 --> 02:31.818
I'm not trying to make you forget.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.279
But I'm, I'm still here.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.532
And, and this, us, moving on?

02:37.615 --> 02:40.410
It's more important
than some old comic book.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.707
It was dad's favorite.

02:49.752 --> 02:50.920
Sam...

03:27.123 --> 03:30.460
No, no, no, no, no,
I've had enough of wet comics today.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.720
No, no, no.

03:52.148 --> 03:53.900
No, no, no, no.

04:21.135 --> 04:22.553
This is not my room.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.182
Where am I?

04:34.482 --> 04:37.068
I'm in a picture with Tommy Munson?

04:37.151 --> 04:39.112
These aren't my clothes.

04:43.574 --> 04:44.784
What's going on?

04:53.710 --> 04:55.461
You're up.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.676
Oh, honey, are you feeling okay?

05:05.471 --> 05:06.514
That's my boy.

05:06.597 --> 05:08.433
I told 'em you'd bounce right back.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.768
My boy...

05:10.852 --> 05:13.062
The doctor said you might be
confused about some things.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.315
Yeah. It's, it's just a minor concussion.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.984
-No big deal.
-After you went in for the header.

05:18.067 --> 05:20.862
Header? Like, as in soccer?

05:22.822 --> 05:24.699
Sam, you were All-State last year.

05:24.782 --> 05:27.410
No. No, I, I was in my treehouse, and...

05:27.493 --> 05:28.453
Treehouse?

05:28.536 --> 05:29.454
I don't live here.

05:29.537 --> 05:31.331
-Should we call the doctor?

05:31.414 --> 05:33.458
No, he said
it might not come back all at once.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.585
Maybe we should just try
to jog his memory.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.047
See, champ?

05:39.130 --> 05:41.132
You shot that birdie on the 18th hole?

05:42.717 --> 05:44.052
I, um...

05:45.720 --> 05:48.181
I think I just need to lay down again.

05:48.806 --> 05:50.016
-Sure.
-Oh.

05:50.558 --> 05:51.684
Okay.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.169
Can I help you?

06:18.252 --> 06:19.754
Very funny, Mom.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.340
Hey... hey, excuse me?

06:22.423 --> 06:24.467
Look, I'm sorry
for being a jerk yesterday,

06:24.550 --> 06:26.219
but you didn't have to prank me like that.

06:26.302 --> 06:27.804
That really freaked me out.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.722
Do I know you?

06:29.806 --> 06:31.557
Yeah. You're my mom,

06:31.641 --> 06:33.142
this is our house,

06:33.226 --> 06:34.477
our stuff,

06:34.560 --> 06:36.521
our tree...

06:37.105 --> 06:38.648
house.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.567
Jenny? Everything all right?

06:42.193 --> 06:43.319
Dad?

06:47.031 --> 06:49.784
-Dad!

06:51.244 --> 06:53.037
He thinks I'm his mom.

06:53.830 --> 06:57.291
Hey, buddy, if you're lost,
we can call your parents.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.585
You are my parents!

07:00.253 --> 07:01.921
I think we should call the police.

07:02.004 --> 07:03.297
Yeah, maybe.

07:04.173 --> 07:05.550
Why are you doing this?

07:06.134 --> 07:08.177
Okay, I'm getting the phone.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.513
What is happening?

07:55.933 --> 07:56.809
What do you want?

07:56.893 --> 07:58.060
Do you know who I am?

07:58.811 --> 08:00.521
-Yeah, you're Sam.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.064
Oh, thank God.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.608
Why are you at my house?

08:04.066 --> 08:05.860
Because we're best friends?

08:06.611 --> 08:08.446
Oh, okay. Funny.

08:08.529 --> 08:10.573
You and Tommy don't punk me
enough at school,

08:10.656 --> 08:13.242
-so now you gotta come to my house?
-Wait, wait. Tommy?

08:13.326 --> 08:15.286
Yeah, you and your alpha bro Tommy Munson.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.330
What, is he gonna come jumping
out of the bushes now?

08:17.413 --> 08:18.372
Mason, listen to me.

08:18.456 --> 08:21.292
I was in my treehouse,
and there was this storm, and lightning,

08:21.375 --> 08:25.046
and all of a sudden I'm here...
and my dad's alive.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.507
Cool, good luck with that.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.259
Wait! We've been best friends
since kindergarten.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.178
-Uh-huh.
-We made up our own secret language.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.472
-Let go of the door!
-I know about the mayonnaise incident!

08:36.474 --> 08:39.018
Yeah, and you still sleep
with your stuffed cat, Saint Jerome.

08:39.101 --> 08:41.187
You gag when you smell licorice,

08:41.270 --> 08:43.439
and you have a weird belly button.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.941
You fart when you're scared.

08:47.151 --> 08:50.154
Mason, I think
I'm in an alternate universe.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.823
I really need your help, please.

08:58.037 --> 09:01.082
<i>Maybe the storm caused
some kind of interdimensional rift.</i>

09:01.165 --> 09:03.167
There's plenty of examples in comics.

09:03.251 --> 09:06.045
Actually, half of these
are about interdimensional rifts.

09:06.128 --> 09:07.380
But why give me another life?

09:07.964 --> 09:11.175
Well, normally, when people wake up
in other people's bodies,

09:11.259 --> 09:12.802
it's 'cause they have to learn a lesson.

09:12.885 --> 09:15.096
Like a bully waking up as a weakling.

09:15.179 --> 09:16.847
Mason, we were the weaklings.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.182
It was just an example.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.351
There's something else.

09:21.185 --> 09:24.397
Before I came over here, I sorta glitched.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.439
What do you mean?

09:25.523 --> 09:26.691
After I ran out,

09:26.983 --> 09:30.987
I was standing on the sidewalk,
and then everything got dark for a second.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.949
All the trees were dead,
and the houses were all old.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.534
Like the Ontario Zone.

09:36.617 --> 09:37.660
Exactly!

09:37.743 --> 09:39.328
What does it mean?

09:41.581 --> 09:42.832
I...

09:43.749 --> 09:46.043
It means you're pretty much a goner.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.086
What?

09:47.169 --> 09:48.713
Well, if it's like the Zone,

09:48.796 --> 09:52.049
you're gonna glitch more and more
until you're stuck there forever.

09:52.717 --> 09:53.968
Unless...

09:55.553 --> 09:57.638
Uh, no. It's too crazy.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.599
Mason, I guarantee you it's not too crazy.

09:59.682 --> 10:00.975
Okay.

10:01.058 --> 10:06.314
If the treehouse brought you in,
maybe, just maybe, it can get you out.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.151
But there's no treehouse in this universe.

10:10.234 --> 10:12.278
Then you have to
convince them to build one

10:12.361 --> 10:13.696
before it's too late.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.412
Like this, down...

10:33.299 --> 10:34.550
There he is.

10:38.721 --> 10:39.930
What are you doing?

10:40.014 --> 10:41.015
Better vantage point?

10:45.853 --> 10:47.104
Think he's seen us?

10:47.813 --> 10:49.273
I think he saw us.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.235
Where'd he go?

10:53.319 --> 10:54.820
-Um, you wanna split up?
-Go.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.238
Can I help you?

10:56.822 --> 10:58.199
How do you know where I work?

10:58.282 --> 10:59.992
Oh, we know a lot of things.

11:00.076 --> 11:03.120
Look, Dad. I, I mean, Andy. Uh...

11:03.704 --> 11:05.164
I know how insane this is gonna sound,

11:05.247 --> 11:07.500
but I come from a alternate universe
where you're my dad and I--

11:07.583 --> 11:09.627
Yeah, uh-huh.
I really don't have time for this.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.337
-Let's go.
-You can't make us leave!

11:11.420 --> 11:13.714
We're customers, we want wood! Lots of it!

11:13.798 --> 11:15.925
Okay, this time,
I really am gonna call the police.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.259
You grew up in Grand Rapids!

11:17.343 --> 11:19.679
Your first dog
was a Dalmatian named Freckles.

11:19.762 --> 11:22.390
You met mom, Jenny,
at an ice cream parlor.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.475
You always get a double scoop
of Rocky Road.

11:24.558 --> 11:27.144
And you're, you think golf is ridiculous.

11:27.228 --> 11:32.525
Your favorite comic book
is <i>Commander Canada number 43,</i> May 1988.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.402
-Yeah. It's the first appearance...
-First appearance...

11:34.485 --> 11:35.820
...of the maple syrup blasters.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.029
I was in the treehouse.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.031
The one that you and me
started building together.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.534
And lightning hit the tree, it fell.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.286
When I woke up, I was here.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.414
Only, uh, I wasn't me.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.999
That's... that's not possible.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.084
But what if it was?

11:50.876 --> 11:52.670
-I think that--

11:52.753 --> 11:56.048
We think we need to rebuild it
and get me back home.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.304
Look, I gotta go.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.266
Um... I understand
if you don't believe me.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.980
Come by the house tomorrow.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.190
We'll talk.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.193
Okay.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.800
So, son, uh... your mom and I think
maybe you should

12:40.384 --> 12:41.552
stay home until you're better.

12:41.635 --> 12:43.304
But I, uh...

12:43.387 --> 12:44.847
I couldn't reach you all day.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.265
I was worried sick.

12:46.348 --> 12:50.186
Sorry, I was looking
for birthday presents for you.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.438
My birthday was two weeks ago.

12:52.521 --> 12:55.775
Which means only 50 short
shopping weeks till next year.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.943
And I talked to Tommy's mom.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.820
She said he hasn't heard from you.

12:59.904 --> 13:00.988
Oh, uh...

13:01.071 --> 13:02.990
Right. Tommy.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.825
Me and Tommy. Buddy-buddy.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.368
I have an idea.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.871
Why don't you invite Tommy
to the lake with us this year?

13:09.455 --> 13:10.998
That'd be too much fun.

13:11.081 --> 13:12.750
You remember last summer
at the lake with Lolo?

13:12.833 --> 13:15.544
She was so excited to get there,
she could barely wait for us to park.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.837
-Mm-hmm.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.924
She headed straight down the pier
and jumped right into the water!

13:26.013 --> 13:27.473
Lolo. Uh...

13:28.057 --> 13:29.475
Lolo loves the lake.

13:29.558 --> 13:31.352
-She's been going her whole life.

13:31.435 --> 13:33.938
Of course,
dinners are always a little interesting.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.064
I know, right?

13:35.147 --> 13:36.857
Always begging for table scraps.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.819
Crazy Lolo.

13:40.736 --> 13:41.904
Table scraps?

13:42.571 --> 13:44.657
I know I shouldn't feed her
under the table.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.242
But she's so cute!

13:47.409 --> 13:49.703
Son, Lolo's your grandmother.

13:49.787 --> 13:51.205
And our dog's a boy.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.458
Obviously!

13:54.542 --> 13:56.836
Everyone's talking about my bad memory.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.921
You guys forgot how funny I am!

14:01.882 --> 14:03.384
That, that was a good one, son.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.850
You think this is all a dream?

14:11.934 --> 14:14.645
Part of me wants to wake up
in my own room.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.649
But then, I wouldn't get
to see my dad tomorrow.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.696
Seeing you wouldn't be
so bad either, I guess.

14:23.779 --> 14:26.615
For the record, you look like a Lolo.

14:45.342 --> 14:47.344
It is a pretty sweet spot
for a treehouse.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.222
We finished the last one in two days.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.016
Well, except for the roof.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.851
We didn't finish that part.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.019
Why didn't we finish it?

14:56.061 --> 14:57.730
Um...

14:57.813 --> 15:00.482
I guess we just kinda lost interest.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.483
Hmm.

15:01.567 --> 15:02.818
Andy?

15:03.611 --> 15:04.945
Can I talk to you for a second?

15:05.029 --> 15:05.905
Yeah.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.281
It's fine.

15:08.532 --> 15:11.076
You're not seriously considering
building a treehouse?

15:11.160 --> 15:14.914
I mean... you don't believe him, right?

15:14.997 --> 15:19.293
He knew things about me only a,
a son would know about his father.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.296
So, yeah, I believe it's possible.

15:22.379 --> 15:25.090
I've read about people
who've had these same experience...

15:25.174 --> 15:27.259
Yeah, Andy, in comic books.

15:28.385 --> 15:29.386
Look...

15:29.470 --> 15:31.472
I wanna help this kid too, but this?

15:31.555 --> 15:32.932
This, it's--

15:33.015 --> 15:34.516
Crazy. I know.

15:35.100 --> 15:38.312
Look. The way I see it, if he's right,
we're helping a kid get back to his life.

15:38.395 --> 15:39.730
And if he's wrong...

15:43.233 --> 15:45.069
We're helping a lonely kid feel better.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.155
We even get a nice treehouse
out of the deal.

15:56.914 --> 15:59.458
All right, well,
what are we standing around here for?

15:59.541 --> 16:01.293
-Let's go to the lumberyard.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.337
All right, if we're gonna be
building a treehouse,

16:03.420 --> 16:04.713
we're probably gonna need to fuel up.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.340
-Anybody hungry?
-Oh, ooh!

16:06.423 --> 16:09.051
There's this great diner we used
to go to, uh, by the lumberyard.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.386
Hot Betty's?

16:10.469 --> 16:11.804
Yeah, they have the best...

16:11.887 --> 16:13.764
...chocolate chip pancakes.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.801
-Yeah, look at that.
-Yeah.

16:52.052 --> 16:53.095
Sam?

16:53.971 --> 16:55.973
-I've been trying to call you, man.
-Oh, Tommy.

16:56.056 --> 16:58.934
-Thought we were gonna go golfing.
-Yeah, um...

16:59.018 --> 17:00.561
I'm not really into golfing anymore.

17:00.644 --> 17:02.229
Comic books are way cooler.

17:02.312 --> 17:03.939
But, uh, have fun!

17:06.650 --> 17:07.943
Anybody like ice cream?

17:08.027 --> 17:10.112
-I do.
-Yeah! I knew it, come on.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.911
See if we have enough.

17:19.246 --> 17:20.330
Okay...

17:22.458 --> 17:24.334
-Six, yeah. Perfect.
-Okay.

17:26.253 --> 17:27.171
Thirsty?

17:27.254 --> 17:28.213
Yes.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.467
-He's having the time of his life.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.261
He never had another big kid
to play with in this universe.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.597
How come you guys never had kids?

17:37.473 --> 17:38.766
We talked about it.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.518
Something we always wanted to do,
you know, one day.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.898
So, in this other universe,
what kind of mom am I?

17:46.482 --> 17:48.317
I mean, you're a great mom.

17:48.901 --> 17:49.777
The best.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.612
I don't tell you enough.

17:51.695 --> 17:53.572
Or her, I guess.

17:53.655 --> 17:57.659
I'm sure we both know,
even if you don't remember to tell us.

17:58.660 --> 18:01.121
Well, I'm obviously
the world's greatest dad.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.706
Yeah, actually.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.877
-Oh!

18:06.960 --> 18:09.880
-Okay.
-Okay, here come the dad move.

18:09.963 --> 18:12.132
Old-school, shimmy, yes.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.259
-The shimmy shimmy.

18:16.303 --> 18:17.429
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, guys,

18:17.513 --> 18:21.058
-we still got a little work to do.

18:21.141 --> 18:23.477
-<i>Sam...</i>

18:23.560 --> 18:25.312
<i>Sam, wake up. Can you hear me?</i>

18:25.395 --> 18:26.855
<i>Sam...</i>

18:27.439 --> 18:28.690
<i>Sam...</i>

18:32.528 --> 18:34.196
<i>Sam, wake up!</i>

18:38.492 --> 18:39.952
-Sam, are you okay?
-What happened?

18:40.536 --> 18:42.037
I touched you and you just fell.

18:45.415 --> 18:48.627
I've been having these... glitches.

18:48.710 --> 18:49.711
Glitches?

18:50.129 --> 18:53.132
It's like I'm in the same spot, but...

18:53.966 --> 18:55.551
everything around me is...

18:56.552 --> 18:57.427
Is what?

18:58.804 --> 18:59.680
Dead.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.307
Mason thinks...

19:03.809 --> 19:06.145
the longer I'm here, the worse it'd get.

19:06.770 --> 19:11.358
And he said if I don't get back in time,

19:12.067 --> 19:14.570
I could stay in this dead place forever.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.825
Well, then we'd better get
an early start tomorrow.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.538
Are you okay?

19:30.002 --> 19:32.546
<i>You might wanna bring
those umbrellas to work today.</i>

19:32.629 --> 19:34.381
<i>We are in for some weather.</i>

19:34.464 --> 19:36.508
<i>The forecast calls
for severe thunderstorms</i>

19:36.592 --> 19:39.261
<i>starting this evening
and continuing through the night.</i>

20:05.579 --> 20:07.831
-Can I do that?
-Yeah, here we go.

20:07.915 --> 20:08.916
Try yourself.

20:08.999 --> 20:09.958
Mm-hmm.

20:15.505 --> 20:16.673
There's a storm coming.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.176
What if it's the same storm
that knocked my treehouse down?

20:20.177 --> 20:21.136
Then, we'll be ready.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.476
<i>Sam, Sam...</i>

20:27.559 --> 20:29.436
<i>Sam, wake up. Can you hear me?</i>

20:29.519 --> 20:30.812
<i>Sam.</i>

20:38.612 --> 20:39.821
Sam, are you okay?

20:41.573 --> 20:43.158
Hey, hey, it's all right.

20:44.451 --> 20:45.577
We're almost done.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.054
It's here.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.847
Guess we finished just in time.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.183
Actually, there's one more thing.

21:08.809 --> 21:09.685
Come on.

21:44.261 --> 21:46.638
Sorry for leaving
an empty treehouse in your yard.

21:46.722 --> 21:50.350
Well, actually, I'm hoping
it won't be empty for too long.

21:50.434 --> 21:51.977
-Yeah?

21:52.060 --> 21:53.186
Yeah.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.231
I mean, this parenting thing's
been kinda fun.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.212
Lookin' good.

22:20.922 --> 22:24.384
I figure, the more I can make it
look like the other treehouse,

22:24.468 --> 22:26.386
the better chance this has of working.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.015
I hope you're right.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.520
A vintage Commander Canada figure.

22:36.104 --> 22:38.106
I don't have to tell you how rare this is.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.736
You're sure that was
in the other treehouse?

22:43.236 --> 22:44.154
I'm sure.

22:44.237 --> 22:45.197
If something happens to it,

22:45.280 --> 22:47.074
I'm gonna track you down
in the other dimension and kill you.

22:48.617 --> 22:49.701
Thank you, Mason.

23:01.755 --> 23:06.176
Well... see you in another life.

23:12.474 --> 23:13.475
Don't leave.

23:16.436 --> 23:17.521
Sam?

23:18.647 --> 23:19.856
I don't wanna go back.

23:20.357 --> 23:21.858
But you'll have your life back.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.570
But I won't have you.

23:27.572 --> 23:28.740
What?

23:31.076 --> 23:34.204
Where I'm from, you're...

23:36.706 --> 23:38.667
A year ago, you...

23:40.794 --> 23:41.962
Don't tell me how.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.345
That's why you acted
so surprised to see me.

23:57.018 --> 23:58.562
Being with you again...

24:00.897 --> 24:02.274
I don't want it to end.

24:06.945 --> 24:08.572
I wanna stay here.

24:08.655 --> 24:09.823
Forever.

24:10.866 --> 24:13.034
I miss you so much, Dad.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.249
Sam...

24:20.417 --> 24:22.085
your mother is still there.

24:22.961 --> 24:25.338
And if she is anything like she is here,

24:26.214 --> 24:28.508
her heart would break in two
if she didn't have you.

24:29.593 --> 24:33.263
If I was anything like I am here,
then I'd want you to be there.

24:34.639 --> 24:35.974
For her.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.103
Stay with me.

24:40.187 --> 24:43.482
Just a little longer, please?

24:44.232 --> 24:47.652
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course. I'll stay.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.366
I love you, Dad.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.038
I love you.

25:25.273 --> 25:26.441
Sam?

25:27.943 --> 25:28.777
Mom.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.320
Oh, you're awake!

25:30.987 --> 25:32.197
He's awake!

25:34.324 --> 25:36.159
I was so worried about you.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.328
I saw Dad.

25:39.246 --> 25:42.207
-He helped me find my way back.

25:42.999 --> 25:44.334
So did you.

25:47.587 --> 25:49.172
I love you so much.

25:52.634 --> 25:53.843
I love you too, Mom.

25:53.927 --> 25:55.303
-Ow.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.514
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:59.266 --> 26:00.892
You scared me.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.520
What do you think?

26:45.895 --> 26:47.397
Wanna rebuild this thing with me?

26:50.108 --> 26:52.652
Also, what do you think
about getting a dog?
