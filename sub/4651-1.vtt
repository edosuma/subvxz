01:28.422 --> 01:33.301
The white zone is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.

01:33.385 --> 01:36.929
There is no stopping in the red zone.

01:37.014 --> 01:42.226
The white zone is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.

01:42.311 --> 01:45.146
There is no stopping in the red zone.

01:47.149 --> 01:51.986
The white zone is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.614
There is no stopping in the red zone.

01:55.783 --> 02:00.953
The white zone is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.748
There is no stopping in the red zone.

02:06.168 --> 02:07.919
Hello. We'd like you to have this flower

02:08.002 --> 02:09.628
from the Religious
Consciousness Church.

02:09.713 --> 02:13.049
- Would you care to make a donation?
- No, but thank you, anyway.

02:15.135 --> 02:19.889
The red zone is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.

02:19.973 --> 02:23.059
There is no stopping in the white zone.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.479
No, the white zone
is for loading and unloading,

02:26.563 --> 02:29.398
and there is no stopping in the red zone.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.569
The red zone has always been
for loading and unloading.

02:33.737 --> 02:36.197
There is never stopping in a white zone.

02:36.281 --> 02:40.451
Don't tell me which zone is for stopping
and which zone is for loading.

02:40.536 --> 02:43.913
Listen, Betty, don't start up
with your white zone shit again.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.876
Hello. We'd like you to have this flower

02:48.961 --> 02:51.170
from the Church
of Religious Consciousness.

02:51.255 --> 02:52.797
Would you like to make a donation?

02:52.965 --> 02:55.424
No, thanks. We gave at the office.

02:55.968 --> 02:57.635
Flight 988 to Milwaukee

02:57.719 --> 03:00.805
is now in the final boarding process
at Gate 34.

03:04.268 --> 03:08.020
Would you put all your metal objects
into this dish, please?

03:16.071 --> 03:18.531
There's just no stopping in a white zone.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.908
Oh, really, Vernon? Why pretend?

03:20.993 --> 03:23.870
We both know perfectly well
what it is you're talking about.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.830
You want me to have an abortion.

03:25.914 --> 03:29.250
It's really the only sensible thing to do,
if it's done properly.

03:29.334 --> 03:32.545
Therapeutically,
there's no danger involved.

03:32.629 --> 03:33.713
Taxi!

03:42.097 --> 03:43.472
I'll be back in a minute.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.565
Hello, sir.
We'd like you to have this flower

03:52.649 --> 03:54.901
on behalf of the Church
of Religious Consciousness.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.611
Would you care...

04:12.336 --> 04:13.628
Hey, Larry, where's the forklift?

04:14.004 --> 04:15.087
Forklift?

04:15.172 --> 04:18.007
It's over there by the baggage loader.

04:21.678 --> 04:22.929
Look out!

04:35.025 --> 04:36.859
- Elaine!
- Ted!

04:38.195 --> 04:40.196
I came home early and found your note.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.448
I guess you meant
for me to read it later.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.408
Elaine, I've gotta talk to you.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.869
I just don't wanna go over it anymore.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.580
I know things haven't been right
for a long time,

04:49.665 --> 04:51.123
but it'll be different.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.959
Like it was in the beginning.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.127
If you'll just be patient,
I can work things out.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.422
I have been patient,
and I've tried to help,

04:58.507 --> 05:00.424
but you wouldn't even let me do that.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.638
Don't you feel anything
for me at all anymore?

05:06.390 --> 05:10.017
It takes so many things
to make love last.

05:10.102 --> 05:12.478
Most of all, it takes respect.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.481
And I can't live with a man
I don't respect.

05:22.364 --> 05:23.864
What a pisser.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.751
Captain Oveur, white courtesy phone.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.921
Captain Clarence Oveur,
white courtesy phone.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.721
- No, the white phone.
- Oh.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.225
This is Captain Oveur.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.936
One moment for your call
from the Mayo Clinic.

05:54.021 --> 05:57.606
Captain Oveur, white courtesy phone.
Captain Clarence Oveur.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.276
- I've got it!
- Thank you.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.028
Go ahead with your call.

06:02.112 --> 06:04.030
This is Dr. Brody at the Mayo Clinic.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.866
There's a passenger
on your Chicago flight, 209'er.

06:06.950 --> 06:10.286
A little girl named Lisa Davis,
en route to Minneapolis.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.038
She's scheduled for a heart transplant,

06:12.122 --> 06:14.999
and we'd like you to tell her mother
that we found a donor an hour ago.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.959
We have the heart here
ready for surgery.

06:17.044 --> 06:20.546
We must have the recipient
on the operating table within six hours.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.841
I want you to make sure
that she's kept in a reclined position,

06:23.925 --> 06:26.719
and that a continuous watch
is kept on her IV.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.555
Also, it's very important
that she remain calm.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.891
Excuse me,
this is the operator, Captain Oveur.

06:31.975 --> 06:35.895
I have an emergency call
for you on line 5 from a Mr. Hamm.

06:35.979 --> 06:38.189
All right, give me Hamm on 5,
hold the Mayo.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.967
Look. You'll be back
in town tomorrow night.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.053
We'll have dinner. We'll talk things over.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.931
I won't be back.
I've requested the Atlanta run.

07:12.015 --> 07:13.224
Elaine,

07:14.017 --> 07:15.726
I promise I can change.

07:15.811 --> 07:20.189
Then why didn't you take the job
that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?

07:20.315 --> 07:23.984
You know I haven't been able
to get near a plane since the war.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.277
Even if I could,

07:25.362 --> 07:27.446
they wouldn't hire me
because of my war record.

07:27.531 --> 07:28.697
Your war record?

07:29.282 --> 07:31.117
You're the only one keeping that alive.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.577
For everyone else, it's ancient history.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.538
You expect me to believe that?

07:35.997 --> 07:37.081
It's the truth.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.959
What's hurt you the most
is your record since the war.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.794
Different cities, different jobs.

07:41.878 --> 07:45.464
And not one of them shows
you can accept any real responsibility.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.551
- Elaine, if you just give me one more...
- It's too late, Ted.

07:49.052 --> 07:53.430
When I get back to Chicago,
I'm going to start my life all over again.

07:53.515 --> 07:54.849
I'm sorry.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.854
Excuse me,
we'd like you to have this flower

07:59.938 --> 08:02.690
from the Church
of Religious Conscious...

08:11.158 --> 08:12.158
- Good evening.
- Hi.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.326
Well, good evening. There you go.

08:14.411 --> 08:15.411
You can just follow all the way back.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.495
- Thank you.
- Hi, how are you tonight?

08:16.580 --> 08:17.621
Hello.

08:21.168 --> 08:24.211
Any word on that storm
lifting over Salt Lake, Clarence?

08:24.296 --> 08:26.422
No, not likely, Victor.

08:26.506 --> 08:31.177
I just reviewed the area report
for 1600 hours through 2400.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.261
There's an occluded front
stalled over the Dakotas,

08:33.388 --> 08:35.806
backed up all the way to Utah.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.933
Yeah, well, if she decides to push over
to the Great Lakes,

08:38.018 --> 08:40.019
it could get plenty soupy.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.895
Hey, what about that southern route
around Tulsa?

08:41.980 --> 08:44.398
Well, I double-checked
the terminal forecast,

08:44.482 --> 08:47.735
and the wind's aloft,
and IFR ceilings all the way.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.403
Where do they top out?

08:49.487 --> 08:53.657
Well, there's some light scattered cover
at 20,000, icing around 18.

08:54.826 --> 08:57.745
It looks like the original flight plan
over Denver is the best bet.

08:58.330 --> 08:59.371
Denver it is.

08:59.456 --> 09:00.497
Sorry, Clarence.

09:00.582 --> 09:02.625
Latest weather report
shows everything socked in

09:02.709 --> 09:04.168
from Salt Lake to Lincoln.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.045
Oh, hi, Roger. Glad to have you aboard.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.088
Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Victor Basta.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.257
- How do you do, Roger?
- Nice to meet you.

09:10.342 --> 09:11.717
Roger, I was telling Victor,

09:11.801 --> 09:15.512
I reviewed the area report
for 1600 hours through 2400.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.476
There's an occluded front
stalled over the Dakotas.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.737
There you go. Thank you.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.491
Can you tell me
if Elaine Dickinson is on this flight?

09:35.575 --> 09:38.077
Well, the whole flight crew has boarded.

09:38.161 --> 09:39.495
Let me see.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.456
Oh, yes. She is on board.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.920
I'd like one ticket to Chicago.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.255
No baggage.

09:54.970 --> 09:57.846
- Smoking or nonsmoking?
- Smoking, please.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.434
There. Have a nice trip.

10:19.202 --> 10:21.537
Striker, this is Red Leader 4.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.206
Primary target covered by fog.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.458
The decision to proceed is yours.

10:26.543 --> 10:29.295
The decision is yours.

10:29.379 --> 10:32.965
Is yours.

10:41.766 --> 10:42.891
Shit, man.

11:49.626 --> 11:50.876
Nervous?

11:51.795 --> 11:52.836
Yes.

11:53.630 --> 11:54.963
First time?

11:56.257 --> 11:58.801
No, I've been nervous lots of times.

12:05.475 --> 12:09.311
Hi, we'll be taking off real soon,
so I better fasten you in tight.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.396
Thank you.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.398
Oh, Mother, this is so exciting.

12:12.482 --> 12:15.442
I know, but remember,
you must get some rest.

12:15.527 --> 12:16.652
That's good advice.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.405
You relax,
and I'll be back right after we take off.

12:19.489 --> 12:20.864
Thank you.

12:23.326 --> 12:27.287
- God, Bill, I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I'm gonna miss you too.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.997
Promise you'll write?

12:29.833 --> 12:31.166
Every day.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.253
Bill!

12:34.796 --> 12:36.755
Better get onboard, son.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.175
All aboard!

12:41.136 --> 12:44.263
209'er to ground control.
We're loaded and ready to taxi.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.098
Goodbye, Bill!

12:46.182 --> 12:47.266
Goodbye, darling!

12:47.600 --> 12:49.059
I love you, darling!

12:49.269 --> 12:51.728
209'er, taxi to runway 19'er.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.066
Goodbye, darling!

12:56.276 --> 12:58.652
Have your picture taken
the minute you get there

12:58.736 --> 12:59.945
and send me one, all right?

13:00.029 --> 13:01.655
Okay. Here, hurry.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.369
But your watch. You shouldn't.
You're gonna need this.

13:07.537 --> 13:10.539
- It's all right. It doesn't work.
- Bill!

13:10.790 --> 13:11.957
Goodbye, darling!

13:12.208 --> 13:13.375
Bill...

13:14.878 --> 13:18.172
Bill! Bill... With me all the time.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.381
- I swear to you!
- So long, darling.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.966
Take care of yourself. Goodbye!

13:21.301 --> 13:23.427
Flight 209'er, you're cleared for takeoff.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.761
- Roger.
- Huh?

13:24.929 --> 13:27.806
L.A. Departure frequency, 123.9'er.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.266
- Roger.
- Huh?

13:29.350 --> 13:31.810
- Request vector. Over.
- What?

13:31.895 --> 13:34.688
Flight 209'er, clear for vector 324.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.148
We have clearance, Clarence.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.901
Roger, Roger.
What's our vector, Victor?

13:39.360 --> 13:41.320
Tower radioed clearance, over.

13:41.404 --> 13:43.489
That's Clarence Oveur, over.

13:43.573 --> 13:44.948
- Roger.
- Huh?

13:45.033 --> 13:46.366
- Roger. Over.
- What?

13:46.451 --> 13:47.951
- Huh?
- Who?

14:13.645 --> 14:15.771
Do you feel all right, sir?

14:17.190 --> 14:19.525
I haven't flown for a long time.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.577
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
this is Captain Oveur speaking.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.162
- Here you go.
- We'll be cruising

14:32.247 --> 14:34.498
- at 36,000 feet this evening.
- Stewardess?

14:34.582 --> 14:39.836
Our arrival time in Chicago
will be 10:45 p.m. Central time.

14:39.921 --> 14:42.214
The temperature there
is currently 62 degrees,

14:42.298 --> 14:44.716
with a 20% chance of precipitation.

14:44.801 --> 14:47.135
Meanwhile, relax and enjoy your flight.

14:47.220 --> 14:51.014
- Would you like something to read?
- Do you have anything light?

14:53.059 --> 14:57.187
How about this leaflet,
"Famous Jewish Sports Legends"?

14:57.272 --> 14:58.897
Yes. Thank you.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.902
- Ted! What are you doing here?
- Elaine, I've got to talk to you.

15:03.987 --> 15:06.530
You shouldn't have come.
I don't have time now.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.740
- Oh, stewardess?
- Excuse me.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.033
But...

15:22.505 --> 15:24.965
No wonder you're upset.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.675
She's lovely.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.470
And a darling figure.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.682
Supple, pouting breasts.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.059
Firm thighs.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.188
It's a shame you two don't get along.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.190
Yes, I know.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.235
Things used to be different.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.531
I remember when we first met.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.993
It was during the war.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.746
I was in the Air Force,

15:55.872 --> 15:58.915
stationed in Drambuie
off the Barbary Coast.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.502
I used to hang out at the Magumba Bar.

16:02.587 --> 16:05.964
It was a rough place,
the seediest dive on the wharf,

16:06.049 --> 16:08.383
populated with every reject
and cutthroat

16:08.468 --> 16:10.719
from Bombay to Calcutta.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.846
It was worse than Detroit.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.360
The mood in the place
was downright ugly.

16:26.444 --> 16:29.488
You wouldn't walk in there
unless you knew how to use your fists.

16:29.572 --> 16:33.283
You could count on a fight
breaking out almost every night.

17:43.062 --> 17:47.232
I didn't go there that night to fall in love.
I just dropped in for a couple of drinks.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.359
But suddenly, there she was.

17:59.036 --> 18:02.956
I was captivated, entranced.
It hit me like a thunderbolt.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.916
I had to ask the guy next to me
to pinch me

18:05.001 --> 18:07.294
to make sure I wasn't dreaming.

18:12.508 --> 18:16.344
I was afraid to approach her.
But that night, fate was on my side.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.742
We laughed. We talked.

21:26.494 --> 21:27.744
We danced.

21:27.828 --> 21:31.456
I never wanted it to end.
Hell, I guess I still don't.

21:31.540 --> 21:35.543
But enough about me.
I hope this hasn't been boring for you.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.504
It's just that whenever
I start to talk about Elaine,

21:37.588 --> 21:39.798
I always get so carried away.

21:39.882 --> 21:41.758
I lose all track of time.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.469
Would you like to order dinner now?

21:44.553 --> 21:47.722
Yes. Joey will have the steak,
and my wife and I will have the fish.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.641
When can I see the cockpit, Dad?

21:49.725 --> 21:50.767
Joey, I think the pilots

21:50.851 --> 21:53.561
are probably too busy
flying the plane for that.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.188
Oh, gee whiz.

21:55.272 --> 21:56.481
I'll tell you what, Joey.

21:56.565 --> 21:59.150
I'll talk to the captain
and see what I can arrange.

21:59.235 --> 22:01.111
Gee, that'd be swell!

22:04.115 --> 22:06.741
Would you gentlemen
care to order your dinners?

22:12.081 --> 22:13.123
Lookie here.

22:23.676 --> 22:24.843
Excuse me.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.469
I happened to be passing,

22:26.554 --> 22:28.972
and I thought
you'd might like some coffee.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.683
Oh, that's very nice of you. Thank you.

22:34.228 --> 22:36.146
Won't you sit down?

22:36.230 --> 22:37.564
Thank you.

22:39.859 --> 22:40.900
Cream?

22:40.985 --> 22:43.153
No, thank you. I take it black.

22:43.237 --> 22:44.612
Like my men.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.122
Well, you see...

23:54.767 --> 23:57.852
Oh, Ted, I never knew
I could be so happy.

23:57.937 --> 24:01.481
These past few months
have been just wonderful.

24:01.565 --> 24:03.566
Tomorrow, why don't we drive
up the coast

24:03.651 --> 24:05.568
to that little seafood place, and...

24:06.695 --> 24:08.154
What's the matter?

24:08.823 --> 24:10.782
My orders came through.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.700
My squadron ships out tomorrow.

24:12.785 --> 24:16.371
We're bombing the storage depots
at Daiquiri at 1800 hours.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.873
We're coming in from the north,
below their radar.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.834
When will you be back?

24:21.377 --> 24:22.877
I can't tell you that.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.170
It's classified.

24:24.839 --> 24:28.466
Oh, Ted, please be careful.
I worry about you so much.

24:30.177 --> 24:31.553
I love you, Elaine.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.513
I love you.

24:55.619 --> 24:59.247
Flight 209'er,
this is Denver flight control.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.207
You're approaching
some rough weather.

25:01.292 --> 25:03.418
Please climb to 42,000 feet.

25:04.962 --> 25:06.171
Roger, Denver.

25:06.255 --> 25:08.089
We have a visitor.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.424
- Hello.
- Hi.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.552
This is Captain Oveur,
Mr. Murdock and Mr. Basta.

25:12.636 --> 25:13.803
This is Joey Hammen.

25:13.888 --> 25:16.014
- Well, hi, Joey.
- Come on up here. You can see better.

25:16.390 --> 25:18.808
Joey, we have something here
for our special visitors.

25:18.893 --> 25:22.187
- Would you like to have it?
- Thank you. Thanks a lot!

25:22.271 --> 25:24.606
Sure.
You ever been in a cockpit before?

25:24.690 --> 25:27.942
No, sir,
I've never been up in a plane before.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.445
Have you ever seen
a grown man naked?

25:30.529 --> 25:32.363
Do you want me to check
the weather, Clarence?

25:32.448 --> 25:34.532
No, why don't you take care of it?

25:34.617 --> 25:38.203
Joey, do you ever
hang around a gymnasium?

25:38.787 --> 25:40.330
We'd better get back now, Joey.

25:40.414 --> 25:42.624
No, Joey can stay here
for a while if he'd like.

25:42.708 --> 25:44.959
- Could I?
- Okay. If you don't get in the way.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.045
Flight 209'er to Denver radio.

25:47.296 --> 25:49.339
Climbing to cruise at 42,000.

25:49.465 --> 25:52.675
Will report again over Lincoln.
Over and out.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.886
Wait a minute. I know you.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.846
You're Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

25:56.931 --> 25:59.974
You play basketball
for the Los Angeles Lakers.

26:00.684 --> 26:03.394
I'm sorry, son, but you must
have me confused with someone else.

26:03.479 --> 26:06.397
My name is Roger Murdock.
I'm the co-pilot.

26:06.482 --> 26:10.610
You are Kareem. I've seen you play.
My dad's got season tickets.

26:11.362 --> 26:14.280
I think you should go back
to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?

26:15.366 --> 26:18.409
No, he's not bothering anyone.
Let him stay here.

26:19.787 --> 26:20.954
All right, but just remember,

26:21.038 --> 26:23.581
my name is Roger Murdock.

26:23.666 --> 26:25.250
I'm an airline pilot.

26:25.793 --> 26:27.126
I think you're the greatest,

26:27.211 --> 26:30.672
but my dad says
you don't work hard enough on defense.

26:31.840 --> 26:35.760
And he says that lots of times,
you don't even run downcourt.

26:36.178 --> 26:39.305
And that you don't really try
except during the playoffs.

26:39.473 --> 26:41.099
The hell I don't!

26:42.977 --> 26:44.435
Listen, kid.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.980
I've been hearing that crap
ever since I was at UCLA.

26:47.314 --> 26:50.483
I'm out there
busting my buns every night.

26:50.567 --> 26:52.610
Tell your old man
to drag Walton and Lanier

26:52.695 --> 26:55.280
up and down the court for 48 minutes.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.037
Joey?

27:03.914 --> 27:06.332
You like movies about gladiators?

27:11.380 --> 27:13.214
Elaine, just hear me out.

27:14.216 --> 27:18.011
I know things haven't been right
for a long time, but it'll be different.

27:18.095 --> 27:20.722
Like it was in the beginning, remember?

27:21.223 --> 27:22.724
I remember everything.

27:24.393 --> 27:26.978
All I have are memories.

27:27.062 --> 27:30.398
Mostly, I remember the nights
when we were together.

27:30.482 --> 27:33.067
I remember how you used to hold me.

27:34.069 --> 27:37.280
How I used to sit on your face
and wriggle,

27:37.364 --> 27:41.117
and afterwards how we'd watch
till the sun came up.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.870
When it did, it was almost like...

27:44.705 --> 27:49.083
Like each new day
was created only for us.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.086
That's the way
I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.796
But it won't be.

27:53.881 --> 27:57.091
Not as long as you insist
on living in the past.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.064
You're too low, Ted. You're too low.

28:17.404 --> 28:20.031
You mustn't believe everything
that you see.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.867
The mind can play tricks on people.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.786
Pain. Pain.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.413
- He looks so happy today, doesn't he?
- Okay, I'll be back.

28:27.498 --> 28:29.791
Thank you, thank you.
You look so happy today.

28:31.418 --> 28:34.545
Okay, Robert, slip them down.
This won't hurt much.

28:34.630 --> 28:35.963
Give me a big smile.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.716
You got a telegram
from headquarters today.

28:38.801 --> 28:40.385
Headquarters! What is it?

28:40.469 --> 28:42.637
Well, it's a big building
where generals meet,

28:42.721 --> 28:44.555
but that's not important right now.

28:44.640 --> 28:45.890
They've cleared you of any blame

28:45.974 --> 28:47.392
for what happened on that raid.

28:47.476 --> 28:48.684
Isn't that good news?

28:49.645 --> 28:50.812
Is it?

28:51.605 --> 28:55.441
Because of my mistake,
six men didn't return from that raid.

28:56.151 --> 28:59.695
Seven, Lieutenant Zipp
died this morning.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.948
But Dr. Sandler says
you'll be out in a week.

29:02.032 --> 29:03.783
Isn't that wonderful?

29:05.285 --> 29:07.912
I wish I could say the same
for George Zipp.

29:08.497 --> 29:09.580
Be patient, Ted.

29:09.665 --> 29:12.917
Nobody expects you
to get over this immediately.

29:13.001 --> 29:16.254
Hey, Striker. How about a break?
I'm getting tired.

29:17.214 --> 29:19.090
Yeah, all right. Take five.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.135
Thanks.

29:22.803 --> 29:26.013
I've found a wonderful apartment for us.

29:26.098 --> 29:29.308
It has a brick fireplace
and a cute little bedroom

29:29.393 --> 29:31.727
with mirrors on the ceiling, and...

29:31.812 --> 29:34.397
Red Leader! Red Leader!
I'm going down.

29:34.481 --> 29:36.149
Captain Geline.

29:36.233 --> 29:38.276
He thinks he's a pilot,
still fighting the war.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.569
...around here somewhere.

29:40.571 --> 29:43.489
I've found the tunnel, Johnson!
It's this way!

29:43.574 --> 29:46.701
$25 for a cigarette is too much!

29:49.997 --> 29:51.581
What's his problem?

29:51.665 --> 29:53.374
That's Lieutenant Hurwitz.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.543
Severe shellshock.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.753
He thinks he's Ethel Merman.

29:57.838 --> 30:00.214
You'll be swell

30:00.299 --> 30:01.757
You'll be great

30:01.842 --> 30:04.844
Gonna have the whole world on a plate

30:04.928 --> 30:07.930
Startin' here, startin' now

30:08.015 --> 30:12.185
Honey, everything's coming up

30:12.269 --> 30:15.396
roses

30:16.356 --> 30:17.732
War is hell.

30:23.071 --> 30:24.822
Excuse me, sir.

30:24.907 --> 30:27.533
Would you like some coffee
before we serve dinner?

30:27.618 --> 30:29.410
No. No, thank you.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.581
Would either of you like
another cup of coffee?

30:33.665 --> 30:35.333
I will, but Jim won't.

30:35.417 --> 30:38.294
I think I will have another cup of coffee.

30:39.963 --> 30:42.924
Jim never has
a second cup of coffee at home.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.766
- Excuse me, Sister.
- Yes?

30:51.850 --> 30:53.518
There's a little girl onboard, up front,

30:53.602 --> 30:56.687
- who's ill and, well...
- Oh, yes, I saw. Poor child.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.691
Could I borrow your guitar?
I thought maybe I could cheer her up.

31:00.776 --> 31:04.362
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you. Thank you.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.537
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:12.621 --> 31:15.039
Do you mind if I talk to your daughter?

31:15.123 --> 31:17.250
Why, I think that'd be nice.

31:19.920 --> 31:20.962
Hi, I'm Randy.

31:21.255 --> 31:22.547
I'm Lisa.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.382
Oh, you have a guitar.

31:25.801 --> 31:27.426
I thought maybe
you'd like to hear a song.

31:29.054 --> 31:30.346
I'd love to.

31:30.556 --> 31:31.639
Okay.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.474
Let's see.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.685
This is one of my favorites.

31:39.648 --> 31:43.901
I traveled the banks
of the River of Jordan

31:44.444 --> 31:48.406
To find where it flows to the sea

31:48.991 --> 31:53.411
I looked in the eyes
of the cold and the hungry

31:53.996 --> 31:59.000
And I saw that I was looking at me

31:59.876 --> 32:04.130
And I wanted to know
if life had a purpose

32:04.256 --> 32:07.550
And what it all means in the end

32:08.093 --> 32:12.179
In the silence I listened
to voices inside me

32:13.056 --> 32:17.518
And they told me again and again

32:18.437 --> 32:21.772
There is only one river

32:21.857 --> 32:25.109
There is only one sea

32:25.193 --> 32:28.321
And it flows through you

32:28.405 --> 32:31.532
And it flows through me

32:31.617 --> 32:34.785
There is only one people

32:34.870 --> 32:38.080
We are one and the same

32:38.248 --> 32:42.126
We are all one spirit

32:42.210 --> 32:45.338
One name

32:45.422 --> 32:47.340
We are the father

32:47.799 --> 32:57.266
We are one

33:02.981 --> 33:04.440
A little late tonight.
We've been waiting for you.

33:04.524 --> 33:06.817
- Who wants to be first?
- Go ahead, Clarence. I got it.

33:06.902 --> 33:08.736
- Okay.
- How's the weather?

33:08.820 --> 33:11.906
Not so good.
We got some heavy stuff ahead of us.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.325
It might get rough again
unless we can climb on top.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.285
Yeah, after the war,

33:16.370 --> 33:18.996
I just wanted to get
as far away from things as possible,

33:19.081 --> 33:21.957
so Elaine and I joined the Peace Corps.

33:23.543 --> 33:25.920
We were assigned to an isolated tribe.

33:26.046 --> 33:27.505
The Molombos.

33:28.298 --> 33:30.299
They'd never seen Americans before.

33:44.815 --> 33:46.524
It was really a challenge
during the year,

33:46.608 --> 33:49.443
introducing them to our Western culture.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.325
At first they didn't know
what to think of us.

33:56.451 --> 33:58.786
But soon, we gained their trust.

34:07.963 --> 34:11.172
It'll help you better prepare storing foods

34:11.257 --> 34:14.677
for the up and coming monsoon months.

34:14.761 --> 34:19.556
Also, Supperware products
are ideal for storing leftovers

34:19.641 --> 34:22.476
to help stretch your food dollar.

34:23.311 --> 34:29.150
This 2-quart Seals-M-Rite container
keeps hot dog buns fresh for days.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.819
You must understand,
these people had been

34:31.902 --> 34:34.071
completely isolated from civilization.

34:34.947 --> 34:37.491
No one had ever outlined
a physical fitness program for them,

34:37.576 --> 34:39.659
and they had no athletic equipment.

34:39.745 --> 34:41.536
I started them on simple calisthenics,

34:41.621 --> 34:44.248
then gradually worked them up
to rudimentary game skills.

34:44.331 --> 34:46.751
And finally,
advanced competitive theory.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.004
I was patient with them,
and they were eager to learn.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.005
They seemed to enjoy themselves.

34:52.674 --> 34:55.384
It was probably due to the advanced
American teaching techniques

34:55.469 --> 34:58.179
that we were able to bridge
the generations of isolation

34:58.263 --> 35:00.181
and communicate so successfully
with the Molombos.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.523
I think they're getting the hang of it.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.692
When we re-enlist,
I'll teach them baseball.

35:12.319 --> 35:14.737
Ted, I don't wanna stay here.

35:14.863 --> 35:19.074
It's time for us to go back home
to the plans we made before the war.

35:21.244 --> 35:24.163
A lot of people made plans
before the war.

35:24.247 --> 35:25.331
Like George Zipp.

35:30.420 --> 35:32.671
It was at that moment that I first realized

35:32.756 --> 35:35.424
Elaine had doubts
about our relationship.

35:35.509 --> 35:39.386
And that, as much as anything else,
led to my drinking problem.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.014
We did come back to the States.

35:42.891 --> 35:44.767
I tried a number of jobs.

35:44.851 --> 35:48.187
Well, I could go on for hours,
but I'd probably start to bore you.

35:48.271 --> 35:50.189
You know, I really couldn't blame Elaine.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.066
She wanted a career.

35:57.405 --> 35:59.323
I can't stand it.

35:59.407 --> 36:00.825
What is it?

36:00.909 --> 36:03.077
- Yes?
- Oh, it's my stomach.

36:04.246 --> 36:07.498
I haven't felt this awful
since we saw that Ronald Reagan film.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.960
I'll see if I can find some Dramamine.

36:18.593 --> 36:21.428
Captain, one of the woman passengers
is very sick.

36:22.138 --> 36:23.138
Airsick?

36:23.223 --> 36:26.100
I think so,
but I've never seen it so acute.

36:27.561 --> 36:31.272
Find out if there's a doctor on board
as quietly as you can.

36:34.276 --> 36:37.152
Joey, have you ever been in a...

36:37.237 --> 36:38.988
In a Turkish prison?

36:41.157 --> 36:44.243
I shouldn't have had
that second cup of coffee.

36:55.505 --> 36:57.506
Jim never vomits at home.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.719
I'm sorry I had to wake you.
I'm just looking for a doctor.

37:01.803 --> 37:03.554
There's nothing to worry about.

37:03.638 --> 37:04.722
Stewardess?

37:04.806 --> 37:07.641
I think the man sitting next to me
is a doctor.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.311
Sir? Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry I have to wake you.

37:10.395 --> 37:11.729
Are you a doctor?

37:11.813 --> 37:12.980
That's right.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.773
We have some passengers
that are very sick.

37:14.858 --> 37:18.110
- Could you come take a look at them?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.663
Let me see your tongue.

38:00.236 --> 38:02.237
I'll be back in a minute.

38:07.369 --> 38:09.954
You'd better tell the captain,
we've got to land as soon as we can.

38:10.038 --> 38:11.664
This woman has to be gotten
to a hospital.

38:11.748 --> 38:13.582
A hospital, what is it?

38:13.667 --> 38:16.460
It's a big building with patients.
But that's not important right now.

38:16.544 --> 38:19.630
- Tell the captain I must speak to him.
- Certainly.

38:26.721 --> 38:29.014
Victor, we're running into
some heavy weather, can you...

38:29.099 --> 38:30.724
Roger, take over!

38:53.581 --> 38:57.167
- Captain, how soon can you land?
- I can't tell.

38:57.252 --> 39:00.254
- You can tell me, I'm a doctor.
- No, I mean, I'm just not sure.

39:00.338 --> 39:04.341
- Well, can't you take a guess?
- Well, not for another two hours.

39:05.427 --> 39:07.511
You can't take a guess
for another two hours?

39:07.595 --> 39:09.763
No, no, no. I mean,
we can't land for another two hours.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.890
Fog has closed down everything
this side of the mountains.

39:11.975 --> 39:14.518
We've got to get through to Chicago.

39:21.651 --> 39:23.485
Get him out of there!

39:49.304 --> 39:52.514
- What is it, Doctor? What's going on?
- I'm not sure.

39:52.599 --> 39:56.060
I haven't seen anything like this
since the Anita Bryant concert.

39:56.144 --> 39:57.770
What was it we had for dinner tonight?

39:58.313 --> 40:00.814
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.

40:01.357 --> 40:04.568
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
What did he have?

40:04.944 --> 40:06.278
He had fish.

40:06.362 --> 40:08.572
Doctor, there are two more sick people,

40:08.656 --> 40:10.365
and the rest of the passengers
are worried.

40:10.450 --> 40:11.867
I'll take care of the passengers.

40:12.827 --> 40:15.996
Find out what the two sick people
had for dinner.

40:16.456 --> 40:17.706
This is Captain Oveur speaking.

40:17.999 --> 40:21.376
It's been a little bumpy up here,
but we'll be past it in a few minutes.

40:21.461 --> 40:23.087
A couple points of interest.

40:23.171 --> 40:26.423
We're now flying over Hoover Dam,
and a little later on,

40:26.508 --> 40:28.675
we'll pass just to the south
of the Grand Canyon.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.595
Meanwhile, relax
and enjoy your flight, okay?

40:33.515 --> 40:36.100
Chicago, this is flight 209'er.

40:36.184 --> 40:37.684
We're in trouble.

40:37.769 --> 40:40.354
We've got to have all traffic
below us cleared,

40:40.438 --> 40:42.815
and I want a priority approach
and landing in Chicago.

40:46.486 --> 40:49.238
- Yes?
- Stewardess. My husband's very sick.

40:49.322 --> 40:50.739
Can you do something, please?

40:50.824 --> 40:54.451
Well, the doctor will be
with you in just a moment.

40:54.536 --> 40:56.829
One thing, do you know
what he had for dinner?

40:56.913 --> 40:59.164
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?

40:59.249 --> 41:01.125
It's nothing to be alarmed about.

41:01.209 --> 41:03.669
We'll be back to you very quickly.

41:10.635 --> 41:12.636
Dr. Rumack, Mr. Hammen ate fish,

41:12.720 --> 41:14.763
and Randy said
there are five more cases,

41:14.848 --> 41:16.598
and they all had fish, too.

41:16.683 --> 41:18.517
And the copilot had fish.

41:18.601 --> 41:21.854
- What did the navigator have?
- He had fish.

41:21.938 --> 41:24.815
All right. Now we know
what we're up against.

41:24.899 --> 41:27.109
Every passenger on this plane
who had fish for dinner

41:27.527 --> 41:30.612
will become violently ill
in the next half-hour.

41:30.905 --> 41:32.906
Just how serious is it, Doctor?

41:33.366 --> 41:34.783
Extremely serious.

41:34.868 --> 41:38.328
It starts with a slight fever,
dryness of the throat.

41:38.413 --> 41:40.205
As the virus penetrates
the red blood cells,

41:40.290 --> 41:44.251
the victim becomes dizzy,
begins to experience an itching, a rash.

41:44.335 --> 41:47.045
From there, the poison goes to work
on the central nervous system,

41:47.130 --> 41:51.675
causing severe muscle spasms,
followed by the inevitable drooling.

41:51.759 --> 41:54.511
At this point,
the entire digestive system collapses,

41:54.596 --> 41:57.514
accompanied
by uncontrollable flatulence,

41:57.599 --> 41:58.849
until finally the poor bastard

41:58.933 --> 42:02.102
is reduced to a quivering,
wasted piece of jelly.

42:21.164 --> 42:23.916
Turn on automatic pilot.

42:25.460 --> 42:27.836
Automatic pilot. Automatic pilot.

42:28.296 --> 42:29.338
There it is!

42:37.972 --> 42:40.265
I'll go back to the passengers.

42:42.810 --> 42:45.562
Come in, 209'er. This is Chicago.

42:45.647 --> 42:47.773
Flight 209'er, come in.

42:49.234 --> 42:51.735
This is Elaine Dickinson.
I'm the stewardess.

42:51.819 --> 42:53.612
Captain Oveur's passed out on the floor,

42:53.696 --> 42:55.739
and we've lost the copilot
and navigator, too.

42:55.823 --> 42:57.407
We're in terrible trouble. Over.

42:57.492 --> 42:58.784
Roger, Elaine, roger. I read you.

42:58.868 --> 43:00.827
This is Steve McCroskey
at Chicago Air Control.

43:00.912 --> 43:03.247
Get back to you in a minute.
Hold all takeoffs.

43:03.331 --> 43:05.916
I don't want another plane in the air.
When the 508 reports,

43:06.000 --> 43:07.376
- bring it straight in.
- Yes, sir.

43:07.460 --> 43:09.586
Put out a general bulletin
to suspend all meal service

43:09.671 --> 43:11.255
on flights out of Los Angeles.

43:11.339 --> 43:13.298
Tell all dispatchers
to remain at their posts.

43:13.383 --> 43:14.466
It's gonna be a long night.

43:14.550 --> 43:16.051
- How about some coffee, Johnny?
- No, thanks.

43:16.135 --> 43:18.387
I want the weather on every landing field
this side of the Rockies

43:18.471 --> 43:19.680
no matter what the size.

43:19.764 --> 43:21.265
Do you understand?

43:21.349 --> 43:24.726
Anyplace. Anyplace where there's
a chance to land that plane!

43:24.811 --> 43:28.563
Stan, go upstairs to the tower
and get a runway diagram.

43:28.648 --> 43:31.942
Terry, check down the field
for emergency equipment.

43:32.026 --> 43:34.361
Chief, we got fog,
right down to the deck,

43:34.445 --> 43:36.154
every place east of the Rockies.

43:36.239 --> 43:37.572
There's no possible place they can land.

43:37.657 --> 43:40.284
They'll have to come
through to Chicago.

43:40.368 --> 43:42.953
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit smoking.

43:43.037 --> 43:44.955
I want the best available man on this.

43:45.039 --> 43:46.873
A man who knows
that plane inside and out

43:46.958 --> 43:48.292
and won't crack under pressure.

43:48.376 --> 43:50.168
How about Mr. Rogers?

43:53.798 --> 43:55.465
Get me Rex Kramer.

44:01.222 --> 44:04.641
Elaine, right next to the throttle
is the air-speed gauge.

44:04.726 --> 44:05.934
What speed does it indicate?

44:08.521 --> 44:10.856
520 miles per hour.

44:11.399 --> 44:14.568
Good. Very good.
Now check your altitude.

44:15.028 --> 44:18.822
That's the dial just below and to
the right of the air-speed indicator.

44:19.824 --> 44:21.533
35,000 feet.

44:22.368 --> 44:24.619
No, wait. 34,000 feet.

44:25.079 --> 44:28.582
No, it's dropping. It's dropping fast.

44:29.292 --> 44:31.126
Why is it doing that?

44:33.921 --> 44:37.591
Oh, my God!
The automatic pilot, it's deflating!

44:38.343 --> 44:40.093
Now, Elaine, don't panic.

44:40.595 --> 44:43.472
On the belt line of the automatic pilot,
there is a hollow tube.

44:43.681 --> 44:47.768
Now that is the manual inflation nozzle.
Pull it out and blow on it.

44:52.607 --> 44:55.067
What the hell's going on up there?

45:50.331 --> 45:52.040
Elaine?

45:52.125 --> 45:53.500
Yes, Doctor?

45:55.670 --> 45:57.254
Elaine, you're a member of this crew.

45:57.338 --> 46:00.298
- Can you face some unpleasant facts?
- No.

46:00.383 --> 46:03.718
All right. Unless I get all those people
to a hospital quickly,

46:03.803 --> 46:05.720
I can't even be sure of saving their lives.

46:05.805 --> 46:08.849
Now, is there anyone onboard
who can land this plane?

46:09.684 --> 46:10.684
Well...

46:14.522 --> 46:16.314
No, no one I know of.

46:16.941 --> 46:19.109
I think you ought to know
what our chances are.

46:19.193 --> 46:22.279
The life of everyone onboard
depends upon just one thing.

46:22.363 --> 46:25.449
Finding someone back there
who can not only fly this plane,

46:25.533 --> 46:27.200
but who didn't have fish for dinner.

46:38.880 --> 46:42.382
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your stewardess speaking.

46:42.467 --> 46:44.342
We regret any inconvenience

46:44.427 --> 46:46.845
the sudden cabin movement
might have caused.

46:46.929 --> 46:50.390
This is due to periodic air pockets
we encounter.

46:50.475 --> 46:52.684
There's no reason to become alarmed,

46:52.768 --> 46:55.270
and we hope you enjoy
the rest of your flight.

46:56.230 --> 47:00.066
By the way, is there anyone onboard
who knows how to fly a plane?

47:30.181 --> 47:32.891
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline.
I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.

47:32.975 --> 47:35.727
Yes. Come in, Paul. Rex'll be right out.

47:39.106 --> 47:41.525
Shep, sit. Sit.

47:41.609 --> 47:44.402
So, I understand you have
a real emergency down there.

47:44.904 --> 47:46.071
Yeah, something like that.

47:46.155 --> 47:49.699
But as I say, they didn't have time
to tell me very much.

47:51.285 --> 47:53.203
Shep, no!

47:53.287 --> 47:56.665
I'll bet you have exciting things
happen all the time down there.

47:56.999 --> 47:59.167
Well, the airline business
does have its moments,

47:59.252 --> 48:02.003
but after a while
you begin to get used to it.

48:03.714 --> 48:05.257
Shep, come!

48:07.218 --> 48:10.136
He gets so excited
when new people are here.

48:10.763 --> 48:12.639
Are you a pilot yourself?

48:12.723 --> 48:16.101
No, I'm in a training program.

48:16.185 --> 48:18.061
It's unbelievable!

48:18.145 --> 48:20.063
Just unbelievable!

48:20.147 --> 48:22.857
How many times I've warned
those people about food inspection.

48:22.942 --> 48:25.819
You'd think after all these years,
someone would listen to you.

48:25.903 --> 48:28.947
Oh, well. Airport management,
the FAA and the airlines,

48:31.367 --> 48:33.285
they're all cheats and liars!

48:33.369 --> 48:35.787
All right, let's get out of here.

48:43.045 --> 48:44.129
I'm sorry to bother you.

48:44.213 --> 48:47.507
I was just looking for someone
with flying experience.

48:48.134 --> 48:51.344
When they built those roads,
they had no thought of drainage in mind.

48:51.429 --> 48:55.223
So we had to take a special jeep
up to the main road.

48:56.267 --> 48:57.851
In fact, we were lucky to even get a jeep

48:57.935 --> 49:02.105
since just the day before,
only one that we had broke down.

49:02.189 --> 49:04.107
It had a bad axle.

49:04.191 --> 49:05.650
Excuse me, sir.

49:05.735 --> 49:07.277
There's been a little problem
in the cockpit...

49:07.361 --> 49:09.279
The cockpit! What is it?

49:09.363 --> 49:11.823
It's the little room in the front
of the plane where the pilots sit.

49:11.907 --> 49:13.116
But that's not important right now.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.784
You see, the first officer is ill,

49:14.869 --> 49:17.829
and the captain needs someone
to help him with the radio.

49:17.913 --> 49:20.915
Do you know anything about planes?

49:21.000 --> 49:24.586
Well, I flew in the war,
but that was years ago.

49:24.670 --> 49:26.296
I wouldn't know anything about it.

49:26.380 --> 49:28.590
Well, would you go up? Please?

49:45.941 --> 49:47.567
The stewardess said that...

49:50.112 --> 49:51.237
Both pilots?

49:51.656 --> 49:53.573
Can you fly this plane and land it?

49:54.659 --> 49:56.076
Surely you can't be serious?

49:56.202 --> 49:58.870
I am serious. And don't call me Shirley.

49:59.955 --> 50:03.792
Doctor, I've checked everyone.
Mr. Striker's the only one.

50:03.918 --> 50:05.585
What flying experience have you had?

50:05.920 --> 50:07.962
Well, I flew single-engine fighters
in the Air Force,

50:08.047 --> 50:10.006
but this plane has four engines.

50:10.091 --> 50:12.759
It's an entirely different
kind of flying altogether.

50:13.719 --> 50:16.304
It's an entirely different kind of flying.

50:18.808 --> 50:21.476
Besides, I haven't touched
any kind of plane in six years.

50:22.103 --> 50:25.146
Mr. Striker, I know nothing about flying,

50:25.231 --> 50:27.357
but there's one thing I do know.

50:27.441 --> 50:30.527
You're the only one on this plane
who can possibly fly it.

50:30.611 --> 50:32.487
You're the only chance we've got.

51:13.362 --> 51:15.905
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

51:15.990 --> 51:17.657
No, that's what I said. You heard me.

51:17.783 --> 51:19.743
Tell Omaha to acknowledge
and stand by.

51:19.827 --> 51:23.705
Every piece of emergency equipment
you can reach.

51:23.789 --> 51:25.540
Alert rescue units
at every mile of the way.

51:25.624 --> 51:27.208
- From here to the Rockies.
- Chief?

51:28.627 --> 51:29.669
We'll need a pre-landing flight check.

51:29.754 --> 51:31.671
Tell them I'm in the dispatch office,
and I want it here fast.

51:31.756 --> 51:32.756
It's your wife.

51:32.840 --> 51:35.258
I want the kids in bed by 9:00.
I want the dog fed, the yard watered,

51:35.342 --> 51:36.926
and the gate locked.
And get a note to the milkman.

51:37.011 --> 51:38.762
No more cheese!

51:41.390 --> 51:43.391
Where the hell is Kramer?

51:51.942 --> 51:55.904
No, we can't do that.
The risk of a flameout's too great.

51:55.988 --> 51:58.281
Keep them at 24,000.

51:58.365 --> 51:59.616
No, feet.

52:02.912 --> 52:05.121
One of the passengers
is gonna land that plane.

52:05.206 --> 52:07.207
Is that possible?

52:07.291 --> 52:08.708
Possible. It's a 100-to-1 shot.

52:11.253 --> 52:13.963
1,000-to-1. I know this guy.

52:14.048 --> 52:15.131
- You do?
- Asshole!

52:15.216 --> 52:17.342
- Who is it?
- Name's Ted Striker.

52:17.426 --> 52:18.968
I flew with him during the war.

52:19.386 --> 52:21.554
And that won't make my job
any easier tonight.

52:22.890 --> 52:26.184
Ted Striker was a crack flight leader
up to a point.

52:26.644 --> 52:28.186
He was one of those men who...

52:28.270 --> 52:31.648
Well, let's just say, felt too much inside.

52:31.816 --> 52:33.858
Maybe you know the kind.

52:34.026 --> 52:36.986
He went all to pieces
one particular mission.

52:38.072 --> 52:40.949
Just hope that doesn't happen tonight.

52:48.123 --> 52:49.332
Let's see.

52:49.416 --> 52:52.293
Altitude, 24,000 feet.

52:53.754 --> 52:55.129
Level flight.

52:55.214 --> 52:57.048
Speed, 520 knots.

52:57.758 --> 52:59.759
Course, zero-niner-zero.

53:00.094 --> 53:01.845
Trim, mixture.

53:01.929 --> 53:03.888
Wash, soap, rinse, spin.

53:07.768 --> 53:11.729
Ted! What are you doing here?
You can't fly this plane.

53:12.439 --> 53:14.190
That's what I've been
trying to tell these people.

53:14.275 --> 53:15.483
Elaine,

53:15.568 --> 53:18.570
I don't have time to say this gently,
so I'll be very direct.

53:18.654 --> 53:21.322
Everyone in this plane
is in a desperate situation.

53:21.407 --> 53:24.117
Mr. Striker is the only hope we've got.

53:28.622 --> 53:30.290
Those are the flaps.

53:30.374 --> 53:32.125
This is the thrust.

53:33.294 --> 53:35.920
This must turn on the landing lights.

53:49.810 --> 53:51.436
Mayday! Mayday!

53:51.645 --> 53:53.938
- Mayday!
- Mayday? What the hell is that for?

53:54.023 --> 53:55.773
Mayday? Why,
that's the Russian New Year.

53:55.858 --> 53:57.775
We'll have a big parade.
We'll serve hot hors d'oeuvres.

54:09.204 --> 54:11.247
I can't stand it anymore.

54:11.332 --> 54:14.250
I've gotta get out of here.
I've got to get out of here!

54:14.335 --> 54:16.002
Calm down. Get a hold of yourself!

54:16.086 --> 54:17.795
Stewardess, please, let me handle this.

54:17.880 --> 54:20.882
I've gotta get out.

54:20.966 --> 54:24.302
Calm down, now get back to your seat.
I'll take care of this problem now.

54:24.386 --> 54:26.387
Calm down! Get a hold of yourself.

54:26.472 --> 54:28.848
Doctor, you're wanted on the phone.

54:28.933 --> 54:31.434
Everything's gonna be all right, please!

54:31.518 --> 54:34.187
- Sister, please. I'll handle this.
- Just try and get a hold of yourself.

54:34.313 --> 54:36.940
I've gotta get out of here!
I've gotta get out of here.

54:37.024 --> 54:39.233
Out of here! I've gotta get out of here!

54:40.069 --> 54:43.029
Excuse me,
we'd like you to have this flower.

54:44.198 --> 54:46.574
Excuse me, sir, would you...

54:46.659 --> 54:48.743
Donations for Reverend Moon?

54:49.578 --> 54:51.079
Jews for Jesus?

54:51.205 --> 54:53.247
Read about Jehovah's Witness.

54:54.458 --> 54:56.209
How about Buddhism?

54:57.294 --> 54:58.378
Help Jerry's kids?

54:59.421 --> 55:00.588
Scientology?

55:00.673 --> 55:01.965
More nuclear power?

55:09.014 --> 55:10.682
Your attention please.

55:10.766 --> 55:13.518
No-frills passengers now arriving.

55:13.602 --> 55:16.270
Please have your baggage
claim checks ready

55:16.355 --> 55:19.315
to show attendant
upon leaving the terminal.

55:20.025 --> 55:22.944
I know, but this guy doing the flying
has no airline experience at all.

55:23.028 --> 55:26.280
He's a menace to himself
and everything else in the air.

55:26.365 --> 55:27.532
Yes, birds too.

55:27.616 --> 55:31.077
Okay, okay, he's a terrible risk.
But what other choice have we got?

55:31.161 --> 55:33.746
That's the whole story there, Rex.
Everything we know.

55:35.416 --> 55:38.167
All right, Steve, let's face a few facts.

55:38.252 --> 55:40.336
As you know, I flew with this man,
Striker, during the war.

55:40.421 --> 55:42.839
He's gonna have enough on his mind
without worrying about those times

55:42.923 --> 55:44.716
when things weren't so good.

55:44.800 --> 55:46.509
Well, right now, things aren't so good.

55:47.136 --> 55:48.553
Let me tell you something, Steve.

55:48.637 --> 55:50.430
Ted Striker was
a top-notch squadron leader,

55:50.514 --> 55:52.432
a long time ago.

55:52.516 --> 55:56.436
Look, Rex, I want you to get on the horn
and talk that guy down.

55:56.520 --> 55:59.814
Now, you're gonna have to let him
get the feel of that airplane on the way.

55:59.898 --> 56:01.357
Then you'll have to talk him
onto the approach.

56:01.442 --> 56:04.902
So help me, you'll have to talk him
right down to the ground!

56:06.030 --> 56:07.071
Very well.

56:07.156 --> 56:10.742
- Put Striker on the speaker.
- Okay, use my radio over there.

56:12.244 --> 56:15.538
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit drinking.

56:17.291 --> 56:19.375
Now, you can work them
direct from here, Captain.

56:19.460 --> 56:20.626
Thanks.

56:22.629 --> 56:23.880
Striker?

56:25.257 --> 56:27.800
Striker, this is
Captain Rex Kramer speaking.

56:31.055 --> 56:34.599
Yes, Captain Kramer.
Read you loud and clear.

56:38.145 --> 56:40.813
All right. It's obvious you remember me.

56:41.440 --> 56:42.482
So, what do you say you and I

56:42.566 --> 56:45.234
just forget about everything
except what we have to do now?

56:45.861 --> 56:48.071
Let's not kid each other, Kramer.

56:48.155 --> 56:50.406
You know I've never flown
a bucket like this!

56:50.491 --> 56:52.492
I'm gonna need all the luck there is.

56:52.743 --> 56:54.410
Stand by, Striker.

56:55.287 --> 56:56.954
Our one hope is to build this man up.

56:57.039 --> 57:00.166
I've gotta give him
all the confidence I can.

57:00.250 --> 57:01.626
Striker?

57:01.710 --> 57:03.753
Have you ever flown
a multi-engine plane before?

57:03.837 --> 57:04.921
No. Never.

57:05.005 --> 57:07.048
Shit. This is a goddamn waste of time!

57:07.508 --> 57:08.758
There's no way he can land this plane!

57:08.842 --> 57:11.928
Grab a hold of yourself.
You gotta talk him down. You gotta.

57:12.012 --> 57:13.221
Route him into Lake Michigan.

57:13.305 --> 57:15.431
At least he'll avoid
killing innocent people.

57:15.724 --> 57:18.226
You're the only chance they've got!

57:20.854 --> 57:22.188
All right.

57:23.273 --> 57:26.025
Striker, you listen, and you listen close.

57:27.361 --> 57:29.445
Flying a plane is no different
than riding a bicycle.

57:29.780 --> 57:33.449
Just a lot harder
to put baseball cards in the spokes.

57:33.534 --> 57:35.326
Now first, I want you to get
the feel of the plane.

57:35.786 --> 57:38.704
Later, we'll run down
the landing procedure.

57:42.793 --> 57:46.003
All right, now I want you
to disengage the automatic pilot.

57:46.088 --> 57:48.464
But watch out you don't make
any violent control movements

57:48.549 --> 57:49.799
like you did in the fighter plane.

57:50.551 --> 57:53.803
All right, I'm going to unlock
the automatic pilot.

57:59.351 --> 58:01.477
Just remember,
the controls will feel very heavy

58:01.562 --> 58:03.062
compared to a fighter.

58:05.232 --> 58:08.234
Don't worry about that.
It's perfectly normal.

58:20.164 --> 58:21.664
Now, one more thing,

58:21.748 --> 58:23.374
is somebody there
who can work the radio

58:23.458 --> 58:25.626
and leave you free for flying?

58:25.711 --> 58:27.753
Yes. The stewardess is here with me.

58:27.838 --> 58:30.631
Good. Have her sit in the copilot's seat.

58:32.634 --> 58:35.887
Elaine, he wants you to sit
in the copilot's seat.

58:44.062 --> 58:46.606
What's going on?
We have a right to know the truth.

58:48.567 --> 58:50.484
All right, I'm gonna level with you all.

58:51.320 --> 58:53.821
The most important thing now
is that you remain calm.

58:54.031 --> 58:56.115
There is no reason to panic.

58:56.283 --> 58:59.493
Now, it is true
that one of the crew members is ill.

58:59.703 --> 59:01.162
Slightly ill.

59:01.788 --> 59:04.207
But the other two pilots are just fine.

59:04.291 --> 59:06.375
They're at the controls flying the plane,

59:06.460 --> 59:08.961
free to pursue a life
of religious fulfillment.

59:09.463 --> 59:11.088
The radio's all yours now.

59:11.173 --> 59:14.133
And keep an eye on that
number three engine gauge, over there.

59:14.301 --> 59:15.801
It's running a little hot.

59:19.181 --> 59:22.141
Striker, before we start,
I'd like to say something.

59:22.726 --> 59:26.062
I know that right now
things must look pretty rough up there,

59:26.146 --> 59:29.023
but if you do what I tell you,
when I tell you to do it,

59:29.274 --> 59:30.733
there's no reason
why you shouldn't have

59:30.817 --> 59:32.526
complete confidence in your chances

59:32.611 --> 59:35.321
to come out of this thing alive
and in one piece.

59:36.031 --> 59:37.990
Striker, what kind of weather
you in up there?

59:38.992 --> 59:40.201
Rain.

59:40.452 --> 59:43.371
And a little ice.

59:44.081 --> 59:45.164
How's it handling?

59:46.500 --> 59:49.001
It's sluggish, like a wet sponge.

59:49.336 --> 59:50.336
Sluggish,

59:50.420 --> 59:52.213
like a wet sponge.

59:52.297 --> 59:55.174
All right, Striker. You're doing just fine.

59:56.134 --> 59:59.512
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know
how much I hate his guts.

59:59.596 --> 01:00:03.683
It's a damn good thing you don't know
how much he hates your guts.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.899
Can I get you something?

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:15.194
It's your mofo butter
laying me to the bone,

01:00:15.279 --> 01:00:16.821
jacking me up.

01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:18.322
Tightening me.

01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:19.949
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:21.409
Cutty say he can't hang.

01:00:21.493 --> 01:00:22.868
Oh, stewardess?

01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:24.912
- I speak jive.
- Oh, good.

01:00:24.997 --> 01:00:28.124
He said that he's in great pain,

01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:29.792
and he wants to know
if you can help him.

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:31.752
All right.
Would you tell him to just relax,

01:00:31.837 --> 01:00:35.172
and I'll be back as soon as I can
with some medicine.

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:38.551
Just hang loose, blood.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:41.178
She gonna catch up
on the rebound on the medi side.

01:00:41.263 --> 01:00:42.305
What it is, big mama?

01:00:42.389 --> 01:00:44.557
My mama didn't raise no dummies.
I dug her rap.

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:46.309
Cut me some slack, Jack.

01:00:50.272 --> 01:00:52.231
Chump don't want the help,
chump don't get the help.

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:53.816
Say he can't hang, say seven-up.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:56.694
Jive-ass dude
don't got no brains, anyhow.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:05.494
Macias, get me Captain Oveur's wife
on the phone.

01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:06.662
We better let her know what's going on.

01:01:06.747 --> 01:01:10.082
Chief, this weather bulletin
just came off the wire.

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:14.003
Johnny, what do you make out of this?

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:15.254
This?

01:01:15.339 --> 01:01:19.258
Why, I could make a hat or a brooch.
Or a pterodactyl, could eat your...

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:30.144
Hello?

01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:33.522
- Mrs. Oveur?
- Yes, this is Mrs. Oveur.

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:36.025
This is Ed Macias
calling from the airport.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:38.486
There's some trouble
on your husband's flight.

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.780
Now, we don't know
how serious it is yet.

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:43.783
But Steve McCroskey thought
you'd wanna get down here right away.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:45.910
Yes, I'll be right down.

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:52.166
I've gotta go to the airport.

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:54.210
You can let yourself out the back door.

01:01:54.294 --> 01:01:56.754
There's juice in the refrigerator.

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:07.765
Dr. Rumack says
the sick people are getting worse,

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:10.101
and we're running out of time.

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:13.354
I've got to concentrate.

01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:15.481
Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate.

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.149
I've got to concentrate.

01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:19.819
Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate.

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:23.072
Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:26.200
Echo! Echo! Echo! Echo!

01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:31.163
Pinch hitting for Pedro Borbon,
Manny Mota.

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:33.207
Mota. Mota. Mota.

01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:39.463
- How you doing, honey?
- Jack, I'm so hot, I'm burning up.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.715
I'll turn on some air.

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:49.223
What's going on up there?

01:02:49.307 --> 01:02:50.724
Close the window!

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:54.437
Chicago, the passengers
are beginning to panic.

01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:56.230
When do we start down?

01:02:56.523 --> 01:03:00.526
Not just yet. We'll have you
in radar range any second now.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:04.113
I don't understand it. Should have been
in range 10 minutes ago.

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:05.906
Gunderson, check the radar range.
Anything yet?

01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:10.453
It's about two more minutes, Chief.

01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:16.834
Two more minutes?
They could be miles off course.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:18.544
That's impossible.
They're on instruments.

01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:25.509
This is gonna be a real sweat.

01:03:25.594 --> 01:03:28.262
Gunderson, let me know
when you get anything.

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:29.889
Got a cigarette, Nels?

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:32.266
I can't take much more of this.

01:03:35.604 --> 01:03:39.148
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit amphetamines.

01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:41.984
- Johnny, how about some more coffee.
- No, thanks.

01:03:42.402 --> 01:03:44.528
Chief, these reporters won't leave
without a statement.

01:03:44.613 --> 01:03:46.822
How much longer
can those passengers hold out?

01:03:46.907 --> 01:03:48.491
Half-an-hour, maybe 45 minutes.

01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:49.950
Who's flying the plane?

01:03:50.035 --> 01:03:52.703
One of the passengers,
but he's an experienced Air Force pilot

01:03:52.787 --> 01:03:54.455
who flew during the war,
so there's no cause for alarm.

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:55.831
Hinshaw, take over.

01:03:55.916 --> 01:03:57.249
What kind of plane is it?

01:03:57.584 --> 01:04:01.337
Oh, it's a big, pretty white plane
with red stripes,

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:04.965
curtains in the window, and wheels,
and it looks like a big Tylenol.

01:04:05.634 --> 01:04:08.177
Okay, boys. Let's get some pictures.

01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:11.430
I want the one that'll block a wall.

01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:17.019
C-47, right? I love that one.

01:04:37.666 --> 01:04:39.375
This bulletin just handed to me.

01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:41.043
Stricken airliner approaching Chicago.

01:04:55.475 --> 01:04:58.602
Shana, they bought their tickets.

01:04:58.687 --> 01:05:01.397
They knew what they were getting into.

01:05:02.607 --> 01:05:04.817
I say let them crash.

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:24.211
- Would you like a little whiskey, ma'am?
- Certainly not.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.601
How are the passengers doing?

01:05:38.685 --> 01:05:40.936
I won't deceive you, Mr. Striker.

01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:42.771
We're running out of time.

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:44.356
Surely there must be something
you can do.

01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:46.942
I'm doing everything I can.

01:05:47.027 --> 01:05:49.320
And stop calling me Shirley.

01:05:49.529 --> 01:05:51.238
R-E-S-P-E-C-T

01:05:51.323 --> 01:05:53.073
Find out what it means to me

01:05:53.158 --> 01:05:55.034
R-E-S-P-E-C-T

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:56.493
Take out T-C-P

01:05:56.578 --> 01:05:58.287
Sock it to me, sock it to me
Sock it to me, sock it to me

01:05:58.371 --> 01:05:59.496
Sock it to me, sock it to me

01:05:59.581 --> 01:06:01.665
A little respect, just a little bit

01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:03.417
Just a little bit

01:06:13.178 --> 01:06:15.220
Randy, are you all right?

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.599
Dr. Rumack.

01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:22.561
I'm scared. I've never been so scared.

01:06:24.064 --> 01:06:27.149
And besides, I'm 26 and I'm not married.

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:31.111
Now, we're going to make it.
You've got to believe that.

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:34.448
Dr. Rumack, do you have any idea
when we'll be landing?

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:36.659
Pretty soon. How you bearing up?

01:06:36.743 --> 01:06:39.745
Well, to be honest,
I've never been so scared.

01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:42.956
But at least I have a husband.

01:06:55.804 --> 01:06:59.348
Stay in formation. Targets just ahead.

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:02.643
Target should be clear
if you go in low enough.

01:07:02.727 --> 01:07:08.691
You'll have to decide.

01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:12.361
Stay in formation. Targets just ahead.

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:15.614
Target should be clear
if you go in low enough.

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:20.911
You'll have to decide.

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:27.209
Oh, rats!

01:07:28.169 --> 01:07:29.461
Lost number four.

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:32.131
What happened, Ted?
What went wrong?

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:35.926
The oil pressure.
I forgot to check the oil pressure.

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:39.221
When Kramer hears about this,
the shit's gonna hit the fan.

01:07:41.683 --> 01:07:44.560
Watch that oil temperature.
What the hell's he doing up there?

01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:46.270
Striker, that plane can't land itself!

01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:47.730
It takes a pilot
who can handle pressure!

01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:49.481
Ease off, Rex. He hasn't flown for years.

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:51.567
It's not his fault.
Could happen to any pilot.

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:53.068
It happened to Barbara Stanwyck.

01:07:53.153 --> 01:07:55.195
Can't push him too hard.
He might break.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.613
Gotta remember
who you're dealing with.

01:07:56.698 --> 01:07:59.700
Nick, Pete, Jared.
There's a fire in the barn!

01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:02.911
He's right.

01:08:02.996 --> 01:08:05.122
I can't take the pressure.

01:08:05.206 --> 01:08:07.166
I was crazy to think
I could land this plane.

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:10.169
- But, Ted, you're the only...
- I don't care.

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:13.380
I don't have what it takes.

01:08:13.465 --> 01:08:17.176
They'd be better off with someone
who'd never flown before.

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:29.520
Bad news. The fog is getting thicker.

01:08:30.482 --> 01:08:33.649
And Leon's getting larger!

01:08:57.634 --> 01:09:00.844
I know what you're gonna say,
so save your breath.

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:05.974
No. I don't have a thing to say.

01:09:06.768 --> 01:09:09.144
You've done the best you could.

01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:11.729
You really have. The best you could.

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:15.234
You can't expect to win them all.

01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:18.654
But I wanna tell you something

01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:21.740
I've kept to myself through these years.

01:09:21.825 --> 01:09:24.576
I was in the war myself, Medical Corps.

01:09:25.787 --> 01:09:27.162
Was on late duty one night

01:09:27.247 --> 01:09:28.913
when they brought in
a badly wounded pilot

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:31.166
from one of the raids.

01:09:31.251 --> 01:09:33.335
He could barely talk.

01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:36.755
He looked up at me and, "Doc," he said,

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:41.009
"The odds were against us up there,
but we went in anyway.

01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:42.970
"I'm glad.

01:09:43.054 --> 01:09:45.471
"Captain made the right decision."

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:48.767
That pilot's name was George Zipp.

01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:53.272
George Zipp said that?

01:09:55.108 --> 01:09:58.527
The last thing he said to me,
"Doc," he said.

01:09:58.611 --> 01:09:59.820
"Sometime,

01:10:01.239 --> 01:10:03.365
"when the crew is up against it,

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:05.784
"and the breaks are beating the boys,

01:10:05.952 --> 01:10:09.454
"tell them to get out there
and give it all they've got.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:13.625
"And win just one for the Zipper.

01:10:15.962 --> 01:10:18.380
"I don't know where I'll be then, Doc,"
he said.

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:23.385
"And I won't smell too good,
that's for sure."

01:10:25.972 --> 01:10:27.514
Excuse me, Doc.

01:10:28.808 --> 01:10:30.809
I've got a plane to land.

01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:41.236
All right, Striker,
you better stay up there for a bit.

01:10:41.321 --> 01:10:43.071
Soon as the fog lifts, we'll bring you in.

01:10:43.156 --> 01:10:44.948
I'll take it, Elaine.

01:10:53.207 --> 01:10:54.583
Listen to me, Kramer.

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:57.544
Dr. Rumack says
the sick people are in critical condition,

01:10:57.629 --> 01:10:58.962
and every minute counts.

01:10:59.047 --> 01:11:00.756
We've got to land now.

01:11:01.299 --> 01:11:02.507
Don't be a fool, Striker.

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:03.967
You know what a landing
like this means.

01:11:04.052 --> 01:11:05.177
You more than anybody.

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:06.845
I'm ordering you to stay up there!

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:09.056
No dice, Chicago.

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:12.059
I'm giving the orders,
and we're coming in.

01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:15.854
I guess the foot's
on the other hand now, isn't it, Kramer?

01:11:17.899 --> 01:11:20.233
He'll never make it in this soup.
Never, not one chance in a million.

01:11:20.318 --> 01:11:24.112
I know, I know. But it's his ship now.
His command. He's in charge.

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:27.908
He's the boss, head man,
top dog, big cheese,

01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:31.787
- the head honcho, number...
- Captain, look at this!

01:11:31.871 --> 01:11:34.289
"Passengers certain to die."

01:11:34.374 --> 01:11:36.625
"Airline negligent."

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:38.877
There's a sale at Penney's!

01:11:41.756 --> 01:11:43.715
All right,
I'll need three men up in the tower.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.175
You, Neubauer. You, Macias.

01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:47.344
Me, John, big tree.

01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:51.598
Stand by, Striker.
We're going to the tower. Good luck.

01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:53.016
We're going to the tower.

01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:55.185
The tower! The tower!

01:11:55.269 --> 01:11:57.479
Rapunzel! Rapunzel!

01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:03.485
Stewardess?

01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:04.987
How soon do we land?

01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:07.781
Oh, it won't be long now.
Try not to worry.

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:23.130
We're all ready, sir.

01:12:23.214 --> 01:12:25.507
This is Captain McCroskey.
This is Captain Roberts.

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:27.509
Captain Kramer,
this is Captain Colosimo.

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:29.553
Captain Hinshaw, this is Captain Gatz.

01:12:29.637 --> 01:12:31.179
Captain Kramer, Captain Gatz.

01:12:31.264 --> 01:12:33.348
Captain Hinshaw, Captain Roberts.

01:12:33.433 --> 01:12:35.517
All right, Colosimo, you work the relay.

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:37.811
Roberts, check all air traffic
within 5 miles.

01:12:38.438 --> 01:12:39.855
Get that finger out of your ear.

01:12:39.939 --> 01:12:41.273
You don't know
where that finger's been.

01:12:43.943 --> 01:12:44.943
Steve?

01:12:45.737 --> 01:12:47.863
- Got a cigarette, Nelson?
- Now, Linda.

01:12:47.947 --> 01:12:50.407
Your husband and the others are alive,
but unconscious.

01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:52.325
Just like Gerald Ford.

01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:54.453
Now, there's a chance
that we can save them

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:56.997
if Striker can get
that plane down in time.

01:12:57.081 --> 01:13:00.167
- That isn't much of a chance, is it?
- I don't know, Linda, I don't know.

01:13:00.251 --> 01:13:03.545
But we'll do everything we can.
Now excuse me, yeah?

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:09.468
Where did you get that dress? It's awful!

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:12.387
And those shoes, and that coat. Jesus!

01:13:16.684 --> 01:13:20.395
8 miles. Turn right to heading 044.

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:25.984
We're now at 2, 000 feet,
beginning our descent.

01:13:26.069 --> 01:13:27.194
Steve.

01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:29.196
I want every light you can get
poured onto that field.

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.530
Being done right now.

01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:38.163
Tower to all emergency vehicles.
Runway is niner.

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:42.167
Airport vehicles
take positions one and two.

01:13:42.502 --> 01:13:44.544
Civilian equipment, number three.

01:13:46.506 --> 01:13:49.132
Air Force, positions
number four and five.

01:13:49.217 --> 01:13:51.718
All ambulances, go to number three.

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:55.055
Air Israel, please clear the runway.

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:04.022
In a moment, we'll ask you
to assume crash positions.

01:14:04.107 --> 01:14:06.358
Your life jackets
are located under your seat.

01:14:07.026 --> 01:14:08.819
Place the jacket over your head,

01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:12.864
and when I give the word,
pull the cord on the right-side flap.

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:16.243
- Isn't that cute?
- Your seat cushions are also equipped

01:14:16.327 --> 01:14:17.869
with a floatation device.

01:14:18.663 --> 01:14:22.791
WZAZ in Chicago,
where disco lives forever.

01:14:26.921 --> 01:14:29.297
Watch your altitude, Striker.
You're too erratic.

01:14:29.382 --> 01:14:31.299
You can't come straight in.

01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:33.135
You've got enough fuel left
for two hours of flying.

01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:35.512
I'll take it, Elaine.

01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:37.264
Listen to me, Kramer.

01:14:37.348 --> 01:14:41.309
We have people up here who will die
in less than an hour, let alone two.

01:14:41.394 --> 01:14:44.062
I may bend your precious airplane,
but I'll get it down.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.439
I'm putting the landing gear down now.

01:14:46.524 --> 01:14:49.317
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.

01:14:49.402 --> 01:14:50.777
Thanks, Randy.

01:14:50.862 --> 01:14:54.072
You better leave, sweetheart.
You might get hurt up here.

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:04.875
Ted?

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:07.252
Yes?

01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:10.589
I wanted you to know, now,

01:15:11.549 --> 01:15:13.175
I'm very proud.

01:15:17.638 --> 01:15:20.432
Tell them the gear is down,
and we're ready to land.

01:15:24.228 --> 01:15:27.022
The gear is down,
and we're ready to land.

01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:30.400
All right, he's on final now.

01:15:30.484 --> 01:15:33.195
Put out all runway lights, except niner.

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:38.450
Captain, maybe we ought
to turn on the searchlights now.

01:15:39.493 --> 01:15:40.535
No.

01:15:41.454 --> 01:15:44.539
That's just what
they'll be expecting us to do.

01:15:50.254 --> 01:15:52.672
I just wanna tell you both, good luck.
We're all counting on you.

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:58.178
All right, now just listen carefully.

01:15:58.262 --> 01:16:00.472
You should be able to see the runway
at 300 feet.

01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:03.058
Aim the touch down
a third of the way along.

01:16:03.142 --> 01:16:06.561
There's a slight crosswind
from the right, so be ready for it.

01:16:06.646 --> 01:16:09.147
Land too fast,
use your emergency brakes.

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:11.274
Red handle's right in front of you.

01:16:11.359 --> 01:16:13.485
If that doesn't stop you...

01:16:18.866 --> 01:16:21.159
If that doesn't stop you,
cut the four ignition switches

01:16:21.244 --> 01:16:22.661
over the copilot's head.

01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:28.083
Do you see us now?

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:30.752
You should be able
to see the field, now.

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:40.804
- Sure is quiet out there.
- Yeah, too quiet.

01:16:43.182 --> 01:16:46.768
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit sniffing glue.

01:16:59.365 --> 01:17:00.740
There it is.

01:17:03.202 --> 01:17:04.244
There he is!

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:08.707
Striker, you're coming in too fast!

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:10.667
I know! I know!

01:17:10.751 --> 01:17:12.419
He knows! He knows!

01:17:13.421 --> 01:17:14.504
Wow.

01:17:15.673 --> 01:17:17.716
He's below 700 now, still going down.

01:17:17.883 --> 01:17:21.303
675, 650, 625. He's holding.

01:17:21.387 --> 01:17:23.680
He's holding. He's at...
No, no. He's down, he's down.

01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:25.890
Sound your alarm bell, now!

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:30.395
All right, now, everybody,
get in crash positions.

01:17:35.943 --> 01:17:37.777
Put down 30 degrees of flap!

01:17:41.615 --> 01:17:42.824
Striker, now listen to me.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:44.534
Remember your brakes and switches!

01:17:44.618 --> 01:17:46.286
Get ready to flare it out!

01:17:47.288 --> 01:17:48.663
He's all over the place.

01:17:48.748 --> 01:17:51.207
900 feet up to 1300 feet.

01:17:51.292 --> 01:17:52.709
What an asshole.

01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:55.545
Hold up, harder! Put down more flap!

01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:02.385
Just kidding.

01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:06.973
Striker, lift your nose.
Straighten your wings!

01:18:07.308 --> 01:18:10.185
Coming in too fast. Watch your speed.

01:18:10.269 --> 01:18:12.228
He's coming right at us!

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.734
Coming in too hot!

01:18:18.402 --> 01:18:20.028
Ease up on the throttle!

01:18:20.112 --> 01:18:22.405
Watch for that crosswind. Level it out.

01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:24.991
Aim for the numbers.
You'll have to dip your left wing.

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:32.165
You're drifting. Keep your eyes
on the far end of the runway.

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:36.378
You're too low, damn it!

01:18:38.089 --> 01:18:39.964
Watch your stall speed.

01:18:43.386 --> 01:18:44.803
Flare out!

01:18:47.306 --> 01:18:49.224
Now ease her down! Down!

01:18:53.896 --> 01:18:56.189
The brake! Pull the red handle!

01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:05.490
I just wanna tell you both, good luck.
We're all counting on you.

01:19:11.831 --> 01:19:15.166
Flight 209 now arriving, Gate 8.

01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:17.502
Gate 9.

01:19:18.337 --> 01:19:19.587
Gate 10.

01:19:20.339 --> 01:19:22.590
Pull on a lever. Push a button!

01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:31.141
Gate 13.

01:19:31.225 --> 01:19:32.851
Gate 14.

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:34.310
Gate 15.

01:19:44.029 --> 01:19:47.407
Auntie Em, Uncle Henry, Toto!
It's a twister! It's a twister!

01:19:49.869 --> 01:19:51.161
Gate 23.

01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:52.245
24.

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:53.538
25.

01:20:16.604 --> 01:20:20.607
I just wanna tell you both, good luck.
We're all counting on you.

01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:27.614
Striker?

01:20:27.698 --> 01:20:30.033
- Striker, you all right?
- Yeah.

01:20:30.993 --> 01:20:32.118
We're okay.

01:20:32.578 --> 01:20:35.038
Ted, that was probably
the lousiest landing

01:20:35.122 --> 01:20:37.457
in the history of this airport.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.168
But some of us here, particularly me,

01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:44.255
would like to buy you a drink
and shake your hand.

01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:52.430
And, Ted, I just want you to know
that when the going got rough...

01:20:54.433 --> 01:20:56.893
Okay, all right. Have a nice day.

01:20:56.977 --> 01:20:58.728
Okay. Have a nice day.

01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:00.813
Thank you for flying Trans American.

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:04.192
Loneliness, that's the bottom line.

01:21:04.944 --> 01:21:06.861
I was never happy as a child.

01:21:06.946 --> 01:21:08.905
Christmas, Ted,
what does that mean to you?

01:21:08.989 --> 01:21:10.573
To me, it was a living hell.

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:13.910
Do you know what it's like
to fall in the mud and get kicked,

01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:16.329
in the head, by an iron boot?

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:20.208
Of course you don't.
No one does. That never happens.

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:22.460
I'm sorry, Ted.
That's a dumb question. Skip that.

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:25.797
Hurry, hurry.

01:21:27.299 --> 01:21:28.967
Okay, folks. There you go.

01:21:29.051 --> 01:21:30.635
Have a nice day.

01:21:45.359 --> 01:21:48.653
Municipal bonds, Ted.
I'm talking double-A rating.

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:50.113
The best investment in America.

01:27:22.863 --> 01:27:25.406
Well, I'll give him another 20 minutes.

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:26.782
But that's it.
