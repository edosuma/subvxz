WEBVTT

01:51.862 --> 01:52.863
Let's go.

02:08.586 --> 02:09.839
Come on, Kelly.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.101
Hey, Michel!

02:22.143 --> 02:23.978
How are you doing?

03:09.440 --> 03:10.149
Alain!

03:12.193 --> 03:14.320
Going to sing us a little ditty?

03:16.030 --> 03:17.531
C'mon, don't be shy!

03:19.950 --> 03:22.912
Looks like he needs some encouragement.

03:24.205 --> 03:25.497
Come on, Alain.

03:32.463 --> 03:34.548
Tennessee Waltz in E?

07:16.979 --> 07:20.357
He bought two 150-liter refrigerators
from me.

07:20.399 --> 07:22.901
You seen Kelly? You know where she is?

07:22.943 --> 07:24.653
- At the shooting range?
- No.

07:25.154 --> 07:28.323
- With her friends?
- They haven't seen her all day.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.242
She's not home either. I called.

07:33.537 --> 07:34.746
I've no idea.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.625
She can't have gone far.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.227
- Have you seen Kelly?
- No.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.271
- She didn't leave?
- No.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.443
You spoke to her today?

08:05.152 --> 08:07.154
- The whole day?
- No.

08:07.196 --> 08:09.490
You've fallen out?
That's why she left?

08:09.948 --> 08:11.867
We don't talk anymore.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.368
How come?

08:14.119 --> 08:16.872
At Tuesday swim practice,
you don't talk?

08:16.914 --> 08:19.208
Kelly gave up swimming ages ago.

08:19.583 --> 08:20.709
She did?

08:21.543 --> 08:23.295
Where's she go on Tuesdays?

08:23.337 --> 08:26.131
Most likely she's with Ahmed,
don't worry.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.424
Who's he?

08:27.466 --> 08:28.342
Ahmed?

08:28.926 --> 08:29.635
Her boyfriend.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.304
You know about him?

08:33.347 --> 08:35.140
- She told you?
- Not really.

08:35.807 --> 08:36.850
You know him?

08:39.061 --> 08:41.563
He's a kid from school? You know him?

08:41.605 --> 08:42.481
Yeah, but...

08:42.523 --> 08:44.066
But you don't talk, I know.

08:44.107 --> 08:47.569
It's not that we don't talk.
They stopped talking to us.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.908
Where does this Ahmed guy live?
You know that much?

08:59.665 --> 09:03.210
Your sister's smart,
so she thinks she can do what she wants.

09:03.252 --> 09:04.711
That's not how it works.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.298
She's no longer a child,
not yet an adult.

09:26.858 --> 09:30.070
I remember seeing him once
near the sports field

09:30.112 --> 09:31.613
with a young girl.

09:33.073 --> 09:36.159
But, to be honest,
that's about all I can tell you.

09:36.660 --> 09:39.580
Ahmed doesn't say much.
He doesn't tell us anything.

09:39.621 --> 09:40.205
Want a date?

09:40.747 --> 09:42.541
No, thanks, we're not hungry.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.460
You're not worried he's not home?

09:46.670 --> 09:47.754
He's 18, you know.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.965
He's a grownup now.

09:50.007 --> 09:51.133
He's still your son.

09:52.342 --> 09:53.719
You let him run free?

09:56.805 --> 09:59.224
And your daughter?
You know where she is?

10:03.103 --> 10:04.313
Thanks for the tea.

10:04.688 --> 10:08.025
It worried me half to death. Horrible.

10:08.692 --> 10:11.111
Go out without telling us,
stay out all night...

10:11.612 --> 10:13.697
Next day, he'd breeze back home.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.159
Come on in.

10:17.993 --> 10:19.703
- Who is it?
- The Indian.

10:23.498 --> 10:24.791
Here, come on in.

10:24.833 --> 10:25.584
Hi, Chief.

10:25.626 --> 10:26.460
Have you eaten?

10:26.960 --> 10:28.962
Charles, some food for him, please.

10:30.756 --> 10:32.215
It happens at her age.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.426
- She's 16, right?
- Yes.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.261
It's a teenage thing.

10:36.887 --> 10:39.848
Remember the stuff we got up to at 16.

10:40.557 --> 10:43.352
She'll calm down when she gets to 18-19.

10:43.977 --> 10:47.606
Michael's at college now in ChambÃ©ry.
He has a steady girlfriend.

10:48.732 --> 10:50.275
I gotta go look for her.

10:54.363 --> 10:57.157
- Where's the boyfriend live?
- He's from St. RÃ©mi.

10:58.909 --> 11:01.036
Good, that's on our patch.

11:03.205 --> 11:05.582
What's the procedure
in kidnapping cases?

11:07.834 --> 11:09.461
You need photos or...

11:10.545 --> 11:12.756
Sure, a photo won't do any harm.

11:13.215 --> 11:14.508
But you know,

11:14.549 --> 11:18.178
teenage runaways generally
come back home within three days.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.888
Let's not get all steamed up.

11:25.769 --> 11:28.105
Can I see someone in command, please?

11:28.897 --> 11:30.607
Your superior officer?

12:15.944 --> 12:18.321
When she sees
you've searched her room...

12:21.324 --> 12:23.910
It's just a phase.
She's with her boyfriend.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.496
You knew she was seeing him?

12:27.831 --> 12:29.791
Seeing someone.
She said it was love.

12:36.339 --> 12:38.800
- Don't snoop.
- I'm not snooping.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.343
I'm looking.

12:47.184 --> 12:48.143
Alain...

12:49.227 --> 12:50.061
Look.

12:50.103 --> 12:50.979
What?

13:17.464 --> 13:19.007
What the heck is it?

13:29.059 --> 13:30.477
What does it mean?

13:31.102 --> 13:32.103
Where was it?

13:32.145 --> 13:34.940
In my daughter's room.
Your son gave it to her.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.317
That bullshit's nothing to do with Ahmed.

13:37.359 --> 13:38.610
Who then?

13:38.652 --> 13:40.111
It's political crap.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.696
"Political"?

13:42.823 --> 13:44.157
It's Islamist propaganda.

13:45.992 --> 13:46.910
Here, keep it.

13:47.410 --> 13:50.747
But who wrote it? What does it mean?

13:50.789 --> 13:52.082
Back off!

13:52.123 --> 13:54.125
What does it mean? What does it say?

13:54.876 --> 13:56.002
Knock it off!

13:56.461 --> 13:57.712
Where are they?

14:11.893 --> 14:12.477
What?

14:27.200 --> 14:30.620
No, and no going to Korea
for the spare parts.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.498
Okay, Pierre, you think it over.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.750
Fine, thanks a lot.

14:35.792 --> 14:36.793
We'll talk soon.

14:43.091 --> 14:46.970
Alain, it's Bruno's leaving party.
Are you coming?

14:47.012 --> 14:49.055
No, I'm going to the police station.

14:49.931 --> 14:52.100
Sure? They'll call if they have news.

14:52.142 --> 14:54.185
No, I'd rather go, honestly.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.103
Thanks.

15:24.966 --> 15:27.719
It feels like we're being taken
seriously at last.

15:28.678 --> 15:31.306
The police here have done nothing.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.808
We put up posters with her photo.

15:33.850 --> 15:36.603
I'm not criticizing anyone,
but the days go by...

15:36.645 --> 15:38.939
Tell us what we can do to help you.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.692
I'll start by asking you some questions.

15:44.486 --> 15:46.738
Is Kelly a good student at school?

15:46.780 --> 15:48.031
Yes, very good.

15:48.698 --> 15:51.409
She's taking
scientific or literary options?

15:51.451 --> 15:53.370
She has to choose next year.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.080
She hasn't chosen yet.

15:55.121 --> 15:59.376
But would you say she excels
particularly in scientific subjects?

15:59.417 --> 16:01.795
Physics and chemistry, for example?

16:01.836 --> 16:04.506
I'd say she's an all-round good student.

16:04.547 --> 16:05.757
At everything.

16:08.176 --> 16:09.010
And English?

16:09.344 --> 16:10.470
What about English?

16:10.512 --> 16:12.514
- She speaks English?
- Yes.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.474
I mean, her grades are good.

16:17.060 --> 16:20.522
Did you ever take her
on vacation to North Africa?

16:20.563 --> 16:23.066
Morocco? Tunisia? Egypt?

16:23.483 --> 16:24.275
No.

16:28.113 --> 16:29.447
What about Holland?

16:30.448 --> 16:33.743
We spent a few days
in Amsterdam three years ago.

16:35.912 --> 16:38.707
You think she could be in Holland?

16:40.083 --> 16:43.253
I'd like to see her room if I may.
Is it upstairs?

17:06.651 --> 17:07.986
Hold on, I'm confused.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.156
Are you with the police or what?

17:11.823 --> 17:13.575
No, I'm from the Ministry.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.410
But we're in touch with them.

17:15.452 --> 17:16.453
What Ministry?

17:17.369 --> 17:19.247
The Ministry of the Interior.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.042
I'll leave you my phone number.

17:23.835 --> 17:26.921
If you hear anything, contact me.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.049
It'll save time.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.510
Get changed, we're going home.

18:55.552 --> 18:56.511
Fast!

19:00.598 --> 19:03.685
Why'd you come so early?
Practice had just begun.

19:03.726 --> 19:06.479
Mom called.
A letter's arrived from your sister.

19:06.521 --> 19:07.981
What does she say?

19:08.022 --> 19:09.065
Some crap.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.317
So why the big hurry?

19:14.571 --> 19:15.989
She'll be easy to find.

19:16.030 --> 19:19.200
It was mailed in Charleville.
They may have moved on.

19:19.242 --> 19:22.203
- You've got a better lead?
- No, no better lead.

19:22.245 --> 19:24.998
- She says not to look for her.
- Yeah, right.

19:25.039 --> 19:25.832
Get real.

19:30.044 --> 19:32.422
Dear all,
I'm fine. Don't look for me.

19:32.463 --> 19:35.258
I'll send news.
I have the life I've chosen now.

19:37.552 --> 19:39.554
Maybe we need to trust her.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.724
By looking, you could scare her away.

19:42.765 --> 19:44.684
I have to look for her.

19:44.726 --> 19:45.935
The girl's 16.

19:45.977 --> 19:49.439
Precisely. What'll you do
if she refuses to come home?

19:49.480 --> 19:50.440
Kidnap her?

19:50.481 --> 19:52.650
So I'm the kidnapper now?

19:53.526 --> 19:55.570
Don't worry, I'll find your sister.

20:39.781 --> 20:42.283
You wouldn't have seen her around here?

20:42.700 --> 20:44.661
She's tall, 16, long hair.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.835
She's 16. Have you seen her?

21:30.707 --> 21:32.667
You the French guy
looking for his daughter?

21:33.001 --> 21:35.003
Don't sit there, come in for coffee.

21:39.882 --> 21:42.760
Four of us live here,
me, my wife and kids.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.846
You saw the neighborhood?

21:45.305 --> 21:47.432
The living conditions are indecent.

21:47.473 --> 21:48.516
Don't you agree?

21:49.767 --> 21:52.437
They make us pray in a basement.
Just think.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.066
That's why it's good you came up.

21:57.108 --> 21:59.610
I wanted you to understand,
see where we live.

21:59.652 --> 22:00.945
I don't give a shit.

22:04.073 --> 22:07.618
All that, your life,
I don't give a shit!

22:07.910 --> 22:10.538
I'm looking for my daughter.
You know where she is?

22:10.580 --> 22:13.249
If I can help, friend, I will.
I just want...

22:13.291 --> 22:14.375
Knock it off.

22:15.793 --> 22:17.795
You know where Kelly is or not?

22:17.837 --> 22:18.880
No, I don't.

22:20.340 --> 22:21.841
What do you know?

22:21.883 --> 22:23.092
Why bring me up here?

22:23.676 --> 22:26.262
I heard about guys in Sedan.
People smugglers.

22:26.304 --> 22:29.182
- She's with them?
- I don't know. They're gypsies.

22:29.223 --> 22:30.516
Where in Sedan?

22:30.558 --> 22:32.935
A cafÃ© called Le Riad.
That's all I know.

22:34.729 --> 22:35.646
I tried to help.

22:43.404 --> 22:45.448
In there, with my mug, it'll...

22:45.490 --> 22:47.950
Get some rest,
you'll think more clearly.

22:48.242 --> 22:49.952
What do you expect?

22:50.995 --> 22:52.955
I can't tail every raghead here.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.083
Don't talk like that.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.251
You got some sleep?

22:57.293 --> 22:59.003
3-4 hours in my car.

22:59.504 --> 23:02.256
Call me later this morning,
at the office.

23:03.341 --> 23:04.926
Be careful, won't you?

23:07.637 --> 23:08.513
Alain...

24:46.486 --> 24:47.361
Hello.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.530
Where'd you find that?

24:50.698 --> 24:52.074
Where'd it come from?

24:58.706 --> 25:00.124
You speak any French?

25:00.166 --> 25:02.251
The bandana, where'd you find it?

25:04.462 --> 25:05.796
Someone gave it to you?

25:08.007 --> 25:08.883
Here...

25:09.550 --> 25:10.635
You know her?

25:12.220 --> 25:13.596
Hold on a second.

25:13.638 --> 25:14.764
You know Kelly?

25:15.056 --> 25:16.974
She's my daughter. You've seen her?

25:17.016 --> 25:18.100
Over there.

25:18.142 --> 25:19.810
Where over there?

25:19.852 --> 25:20.686
Show me.

25:21.771 --> 25:23.314
- Where is she?
- Over there.

25:23.356 --> 25:24.524
Is she here?

25:25.149 --> 25:26.317
Where over there?

25:31.072 --> 25:32.323
Where's Kelly?

25:33.407 --> 25:35.201
My daughter, where is she?

25:35.243 --> 25:36.702
Where's Kelly gone?

25:38.287 --> 25:39.497
Where's Kelly?

25:39.539 --> 25:41.541
Don't you understand? Where is she?

25:46.379 --> 25:48.548
I'm looking for my daughter, Kelly.

25:48.589 --> 25:49.507
That's Kelly's.

25:51.467 --> 25:52.760
It's my daughter's.

25:54.512 --> 25:55.638
It belongs to Kelly.

25:56.764 --> 25:58.683
I'm looking for my daughter.

26:12.113 --> 26:14.198
This is Alain Balland, the father of...

26:14.615 --> 26:16.409
I've found my daughter in Sedan.

26:17.326 --> 26:20.246
In a kind of camp outside town,
near the N58.

26:20.288 --> 26:21.372
I tried to...

26:23.499 --> 26:25.459
A "memo"? You're shitting me?

26:26.210 --> 26:28.546
Send a unit right now.

26:33.301 --> 26:36.012
I'll go home
when I have my daughter, asshole!

29:02.032 --> 29:02.783
Kid!

29:06.537 --> 29:07.413
Move!

29:08.080 --> 29:09.457
We've gotta go.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.557
I got confirmation.

29:26.891 --> 29:28.309
She's in Antwerp.

29:38.527 --> 29:39.528
Antwerp?

29:55.085 --> 29:55.669
Dad!

30:52.434 --> 30:54.311
See if you find her in there.

31:11.495 --> 31:13.747
You go everywhere with your dad?

31:17.084 --> 31:19.295
He's right to keep looking for her.

31:19.753 --> 31:21.171
Never give up.

31:24.425 --> 31:26.927
You know how those savages treat women?

31:32.892 --> 31:33.893
That's her.

31:34.393 --> 31:35.519
I've found her.

31:36.270 --> 31:37.313
It's Kelly.

31:41.108 --> 31:42.568
Look, your sister.

31:43.485 --> 31:44.361
Shit!

31:45.195 --> 31:45.863
That's Kelly.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.002
Aafia Khalid.

32:02.004 --> 32:04.131
So she calls herself now.

32:05.132 --> 32:08.969
She's with the Algerians
who ordered the documents from me.

32:09.803 --> 32:11.055
I'll give you an address.

32:11.555 --> 32:13.474
You'll find some Syrians there.

32:13.974 --> 32:15.517
They'll know where she is.

32:16.727 --> 32:19.438
But you need
to take something to exchange.

32:19.855 --> 32:21.148
That's for sure.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.402
What do you want in exchange?

32:26.070 --> 32:26.987
Nothing.

32:28.948 --> 32:30.115
It's for you.

32:30.783 --> 32:31.867
And your son.

32:34.954 --> 32:35.913
Thanks.

32:49.677 --> 32:51.387
No street names signposted.

33:00.187 --> 33:01.981
As soon as you can, U-turn.

33:03.607 --> 33:04.525
Go on.

33:04.566 --> 33:06.485
I can't, not before the next...

33:07.528 --> 33:09.071
The next roundabout.

33:12.074 --> 33:13.659
There's no one. Turn here.

33:13.701 --> 33:14.868
No, I can't.

33:37.766 --> 33:38.600
Dad...

33:40.269 --> 33:41.478
Seen them.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.813
What do we do?

33:42.855 --> 33:44.148
Look straight ahead.

33:47.067 --> 33:48.610
Straight ahead, I said.

36:23.182 --> 36:25.350
Visiting hours are over.

38:19.715 --> 38:20.716
Your mother...

38:21.508 --> 38:23.051
She's seeing Charles?

38:30.100 --> 38:32.394
You can tell me. I don't care anymore.

38:40.235 --> 38:41.695
He comes by a lot.

38:45.907 --> 38:47.451
You hang out with him?

38:49.494 --> 38:50.412
No.

38:53.707 --> 38:54.750
Why?

38:58.337 --> 38:59.296
I don't know.

39:03.550 --> 39:05.093
We hang out together.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.808
You got any money for tobacco?

39:55.852 --> 39:57.312
You've got none left?

39:58.397 --> 39:59.231
No.

40:35.350 --> 40:36.643
We'll get them.

40:37.018 --> 40:38.019
Yes, dad.

41:25.108 --> 41:27.861
You went to Yemen, Denmark, Turkey...

41:27.903 --> 41:29.529
All for what?

41:29.571 --> 41:32.407
You're his brother.
Give him some support.

41:33.992 --> 41:36.578
I hope you'd do as much
if I was captured.

41:36.620 --> 41:37.787
Captured?

41:37.829 --> 41:39.122
Listen to you.

41:39.164 --> 41:41.041
You're both off whack.

41:45.921 --> 41:49.549
Thierry called me about the cash again.
What do I tell him?

41:52.552 --> 41:55.847
I'm not telling you to stop looking,
just take a break.

41:56.306 --> 41:57.390
I'm not hungry.

42:10.487 --> 42:12.197
You got back last night?

42:12.239 --> 42:12.989
Yes.

42:14.282 --> 42:16.159
We went all the way to Denmark.

42:17.994 --> 42:18.578
Well?

42:20.205 --> 42:22.040
Well, it's a hell of a way.

42:25.627 --> 42:26.670
You know...

42:26.711 --> 42:29.839
I was thinking
you should spend less time with me

42:29.881 --> 42:30.840
in the forest.

42:37.222 --> 42:39.599
You should hang out
with people your age.

42:41.935 --> 42:43.144
They bore me stupid.

42:45.021 --> 42:46.481
Especially their music.

42:47.482 --> 42:48.775
They just bore me.

42:51.778 --> 42:53.363
You have to force yourself.

42:55.282 --> 42:57.534
Or else, one day,
without you noticing,

42:58.410 --> 43:01.871
you end up living alone
in a cabin in the forest.

43:03.164 --> 43:04.666
Eating squirrels.

43:48.627 --> 43:50.337
We got a letter from Kelly.

43:52.172 --> 43:53.214
She's had a baby.

43:57.594 --> 43:59.429
Your mom called to let me know.

44:05.393 --> 44:07.437
- Her name's Mada...
- Mayyadah.

44:11.024 --> 44:12.567
Our granddaughter.

44:14.194 --> 44:16.738
Mayyadah means
she who walks with pride.

44:21.576 --> 44:22.661
Mayyadah.

44:23.536 --> 44:24.663
Pretty, isn't it?

44:26.998 --> 44:29.751
Don't tell your father.
Last thing he needs.

44:35.924 --> 44:37.175
I'll be going.

44:38.343 --> 44:39.719
Thanks for the call.

44:42.430 --> 44:44.349
I'll make you a copy of the photo.

44:48.561 --> 44:50.605
Do all you can for your mother.

44:50.647 --> 44:51.981
You're a good boy.

44:53.983 --> 44:55.318
Your sister too.

44:55.360 --> 44:57.445
She writes her parents, at least.

45:49.497 --> 45:50.749
Enjoy!

45:54.627 --> 45:55.837
We've gotta go.

45:56.296 --> 45:57.422
I got a tipoff.

45:58.465 --> 46:00.383
Ahmed's in Antwerp. They spotted him.

46:01.176 --> 46:03.136
Antwerp again?

46:04.429 --> 46:06.264
Honestly, he's there, for sure.

46:07.056 --> 46:10.268
I know who tipped you off.
The guy's bullshitting you.

46:11.144 --> 46:12.937
Great you made it. How are you?

46:12.979 --> 46:14.147
Yeah, great.

46:16.191 --> 46:17.901
Isabelle loaned me some cash.

46:18.401 --> 46:20.195
We have to go right away.

46:20.236 --> 46:21.696
C'mon, forget the burgers.

46:21.738 --> 46:24.532
- You're gonna sing us...
- Shut up and back off!

46:28.953 --> 46:29.954
Beat it!

46:31.831 --> 46:33.333
Come on, let's go.

46:38.630 --> 46:39.464
No.

46:40.131 --> 46:41.132
Kid...

46:45.678 --> 46:46.638
Please.

46:51.184 --> 46:52.727
You too...

46:54.521 --> 46:55.563
Me too?

46:56.523 --> 46:57.649
Me too what?

46:58.316 --> 46:59.818
C'mon, dad, me too what?

47:05.824 --> 47:06.950
Forget it.

47:15.500 --> 47:17.460
Georges, pack a bag and let's go.

47:21.798 --> 47:22.757
Georges.

47:26.511 --> 47:28.346
Pack a bag and let's go!

47:30.598 --> 47:31.349
It's okay.

51:08.733 --> 51:09.692
You know...

51:11.277 --> 51:12.737
I realize now...

51:14.072 --> 51:16.616
At least dad knew
what he was looking for.

51:19.577 --> 51:20.745
That's rare.

51:21.370 --> 51:23.122
Not many guys know.

51:25.124 --> 51:27.085
So he didn't die for nothing.

52:13.089 --> 52:14.966
We have a bid of 860.

52:15.007 --> 52:16.968
Raised to 880. And 890!

53:17.653 --> 53:21.365
...the first tower, which you see on screen,
was engulfed in flames.

53:21.407 --> 53:23.117
Precisely 18 minutes later,

53:23.159 --> 53:28.831
a second plane crashed into the second tower
of the World Trade Center.

53:28.873 --> 53:32.043
We are all witnessing
the incredible image

53:32.084 --> 53:34.921
of the second tower collapsing
right before our eyes.

53:34.962 --> 53:38.674
A gigantic dust cloud
slowly rolls over Manhattan.

53:39.091 --> 53:41.719
No word yet as to the number of victims.

53:41.761 --> 53:45.348
A wave of panic has swept over
America's Department of Homeland Security.

53:45.389 --> 53:50.561
The White House, Capitol Hill and
the Department of Treasury are being evacuated.

53:52.939 --> 53:54.774
My first memory of Kelly

53:56.025 --> 53:58.569
was when she was
maybe eight or nine,

53:59.820 --> 54:01.113
so I must've been

54:02.490 --> 54:03.699
five or six.

54:07.703 --> 54:08.913
I was in your bed.

54:10.414 --> 54:13.334
She came into the bedroom
in her pajamas.

54:15.461 --> 54:16.796
You told her

54:16.837 --> 54:19.215
her hair was too long
and needed cutting.

54:22.343 --> 54:24.720
I think
it was the first time I realized

54:25.513 --> 54:27.098
that time passes,

54:27.139 --> 54:29.475
hair grows and needs cutting.

54:30.184 --> 54:31.519
Then it grows again

54:32.561 --> 54:34.188
and you have to start over.

54:34.730 --> 54:35.815
Over and over.

01:03:52.663 --> 01:03:53.789
Got it?

01:11:48.972 --> 01:11:49.931
Ahmed!

01:11:54.185 --> 01:11:55.520
You recognize me?

01:11:56.396 --> 01:11:57.314
Don't you recognize me?

01:11:58.356 --> 01:12:00.734
I'm Kelly's little brother.
It's me. Kid.

01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:06.573
Her little brother? Georges?

01:12:06.614 --> 01:12:08.867
Yes. I'm looking for Kelly, that's all.

01:12:11.703 --> 01:12:12.620
How'd you get here?

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.081
What?

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:18.793
How did you find me?

01:12:20.295 --> 01:12:22.839
You know where she is?
Just tell me where.

01:12:22.881 --> 01:12:25.383
- Who sent you?
- Nobody, honestly.

01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:26.843
Just tell me where she is.

01:12:26.885 --> 01:12:28.762
- Who do you work for?
- Nobody.

01:12:29.387 --> 01:12:30.263
You came alone?

01:12:30.305 --> 01:12:31.473
How'd you find me?

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:32.432
Ahmed! Stop!

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.085
Madrid!

01:20:01.255 --> 01:20:04.217
We're here to pick you up.
The consulate sent me.

01:20:04.258 --> 01:20:05.384
You're coming with us.

01:20:08.221 --> 01:20:09.305
What about her?

01:20:10.431 --> 01:20:12.767
I received no instructions. Come on.

01:20:12.809 --> 01:20:14.268
- Hold on.
- We have to go.

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:15.311
Wait!

01:20:21.275 --> 01:20:22.527
We have to go now.

01:20:56.519 --> 01:20:58.771
The Americans told us about you.

01:21:04.902 --> 01:21:06.237
Tell her she's free.

01:21:07.321 --> 01:21:09.740
Nothing's forcing her to come with us.

01:21:10.157 --> 01:21:11.659
I can't say that.

01:21:11.701 --> 01:21:12.785
Why not?

01:21:12.827 --> 01:21:14.495
I try to avoid lying.

01:21:14.537 --> 01:21:16.747
She knows what to expect if she stays.

01:21:23.421 --> 01:21:24.630
What did she say?

01:21:25.756 --> 01:21:27.258
That she doesn't understand.

01:21:28.926 --> 01:21:30.219
Why I saved her?

01:21:30.261 --> 01:21:31.262
No.

01:21:31.596 --> 01:21:34.056
Why you killed her husband,
Abdul Mohammed.

01:21:56.495 --> 01:21:57.622
You got lucky.

01:21:58.331 --> 01:22:00.291
You could've died in that dump.

01:22:04.587 --> 01:22:06.464
I liked your father a lot.

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:12.136
He'd have got himself
into a mess like this, too.

01:22:14.889 --> 01:22:16.641
Except you killed a man.

01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:18.935
Your father would never have done that.

01:22:20.853 --> 01:22:22.146
Back then,

01:22:22.939 --> 01:22:24.273
things were different.

01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:26.692
It was just starting.

01:22:27.318 --> 01:22:28.611
We had no idea.

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:37.828
Ajmal will put you
on a flight to Frankfurt.

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:39.997
I've done all I can do for you.

01:22:40.039 --> 01:22:41.874
When you arrive in Frankfurt,

01:22:41.916 --> 01:22:43.668
you'll have to get by with this.

01:22:45.753 --> 01:22:48.047
There's all she needs in the envelope.

01:23:49.650 --> 01:23:51.110
This is Shahzana.

01:24:09.253 --> 01:24:10.046
Tired?

01:24:46.582 --> 01:24:48.584
This is to start the siren.

01:24:49.835 --> 01:24:51.462
Emergency lights.

01:24:51.504 --> 01:24:53.130
And the rotating lights.

01:24:53.547 --> 01:24:57.134
There you go. You're familiar
with the rest, it's standard.

01:24:58.219 --> 01:24:59.970
You'll see, it's a fantastic job.

01:25:01.013 --> 01:25:02.723
No two days are the same.

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:04.934
You see some amazing stuff.

01:25:05.434 --> 01:25:07.311
- Got a strong stomach, I hope.
- Yeah.

01:25:08.104 --> 01:25:09.313
Let's go.

01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:11.607
Alright.

01:25:41.887 --> 01:25:43.931
- Is that you, Kid?
- Yeah, it's me.

01:27:04.178 --> 01:27:05.221
Nicole!

01:27:05.262 --> 01:27:06.180
Charles!

01:27:07.014 --> 01:27:08.390
- You okay?
- Yes.

01:27:09.391 --> 01:27:10.684
This is Shahzana.

01:28:18.544 --> 01:28:20.421
You take that off here!

01:28:20.462 --> 01:28:22.423
Hands off her scarf. Are you nuts?

01:28:22.464 --> 01:28:23.590
You just accept it!

01:28:25.009 --> 01:28:26.176
What would your dad say?

01:28:26.218 --> 01:28:26.802
Hey, you!

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:29.346
Stop that!

01:28:29.763 --> 01:28:31.307
What's gotten into you?

01:28:45.321 --> 01:28:46.447
Chill out!

01:30:59.329 --> 01:31:02.124
Dozens of people killed
and hundreds wounded

01:31:02.166 --> 01:31:04.001
in North London.

01:31:04.042 --> 01:31:08.338
Four explosions.
Three in the Underground, one in a bus.

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:11.300
The attack would seem
to be the work of Al-Qaeda.

01:31:11.341 --> 01:31:14.678
A claim of responsibility
is under analysis.

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:17.306
The British capital is in shock.

01:31:17.347 --> 01:31:21.268
Tony Blair made a public statement
earlier this afternoon.

01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:23.520
The attack was designed
to have maximum impact...

01:31:23.562 --> 01:31:25.689
Wake up! We've got a way to go.

01:31:47.878 --> 01:31:48.545
Please.

01:31:55.594 --> 01:31:56.178
Please.

01:33:24.975 --> 01:33:26.226
Imran, let me try.

01:33:27.686 --> 01:33:30.272
Stand over there
with an apple on your head.

01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:38.864
Take the string and slip it under.

01:33:40.073 --> 01:33:42.075
Pull it nice and tight and then...

01:33:43.035 --> 01:33:44.703
Then you tie a knot.

01:33:45.579 --> 01:33:47.873
The knot has to be good and tight.

01:33:48.582 --> 01:33:51.418
Choose an arrow,
put it in the little notch.

01:33:52.544 --> 01:33:54.087
You pull hard...

01:33:58.842 --> 01:33:59.718
See that?

01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:01.261
Want to make a bigger one?

01:34:01.303 --> 01:34:02.763
Ask mom for some string.

01:34:03.055 --> 01:34:04.264
Mommy!

01:34:04.890 --> 01:34:06.558
What do you want, sweetie?

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:07.726
String.

01:34:07.768 --> 01:34:10.312
You want string?
Let's look in the kitchen.

01:34:11.730 --> 01:34:12.397
Hello.

01:34:23.492 --> 01:34:24.534
Your son?

01:34:37.673 --> 01:34:40.592
I've been trying to track down Ahmed.

01:34:41.635 --> 01:34:42.844
His mother's ill.

01:34:43.637 --> 01:34:45.097
She asked me to.

01:34:46.932 --> 01:34:48.684
Somebody suggested Belgium.

01:34:49.935 --> 01:34:51.853
But nobody remembers him there.

01:34:53.438 --> 01:34:55.065
One guy said he was dead.

01:34:55.732 --> 01:34:57.067
But he wasn't sure.

01:35:03.281 --> 01:35:06.201
I've known for a long time
he won't come back.

01:35:06.243 --> 01:35:08.954
Even if I find him, it won't be him.

01:35:09.871 --> 01:35:10.831
You see?

01:35:18.296 --> 01:35:21.174
I stopped by because,
when I was in Belgium,

01:35:21.216 --> 01:35:22.926
somebody mentioned her.

01:36:56.728 --> 01:36:57.729
Mom!

01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:14.371
Help your brother, will you? I'm busy.

01:37:14.412 --> 01:37:15.163
Working.

01:37:39.896 --> 01:37:41.398
3.50, please.

01:37:45.777 --> 01:37:46.653
Thank you.

01:38:29.446 --> 01:38:30.238
Mom!
