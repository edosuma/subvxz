01:23.360 --> 01:25.407

01:26.200 --> 01:29.887
Oh, hello, Mr.. Conner,
how do you feel tonight?

01:31.760 --> 01:35.985
Yes, Pine Street, yes, I know.

01:36.880 --> 01:40.362
Yeah. That is odd.

01:41.160 --> 01:43.405
You heard the screams?

01:43.440 --> 01:47.286
Yes, but we sent Wheeler
there 45 minutes ago.

01:47.321 --> 01:49.703
There should catch up at any moment.

01:49.720 --> 01:53.021
Smith, here's Wheeler
I'm here now.

03:04.280 --> 03:07.301
"You can not hide"

03:10.120 --> 03:12.145
"DEATH"

03:12.680 --> 03:15.843

04:29.800 --> 04:33.101
Yes, I am.
Only with payment in advance.

04:35.120 --> 04:39.711
Just pouzeæem. Or no delivery.
"Wear a safety helmet"

04:39.840 --> 04:45.768
How are you already times
delivered? No, or nothing.

04:45.803 --> 04:49.888
Yes. Thank you.
I think you should sit down.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.490
You need to sit down.

05:01.120 --> 05:05.186
I'm your angel
guard, or your sergeant.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.170
Here you have a year
and work very hard.

05:10.280 --> 05:13.581
Appreciate your work ethic
and your value to the company.

05:13.616 --> 05:16.408
But you have to stick to the rules,
like everyone else.

05:16.443 --> 05:19.165
More such incidents as last Thursday's

05:19.200 --> 05:24.288
More we can not simply afford
. You are a patriot. Hero.

05:24.440 --> 05:29.287
I respect that. My son
has also been on two tasks.

05:31.640 --> 05:35.611
If anyone can appreciate the sacrifice
you have made for your country,

05:35.646 --> 05:39.571
it's me.
I can imagine what it's like

05:39.606 --> 05:42.685
return from Afghanistan.
"Homeless veteran"

05:42.720 --> 05:46.222
But you have to behave
as a human being.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.981
We know that you went through a lot.

05:58.800 --> 06:02.661
But I ask you
that you follow these few rules.

06:03.200 --> 06:07.444
But it do not do
or can not do.

06:10.880 --> 06:14.882
The company will not tolerate violent behavior
.

06:19.480 --> 06:23.804
Listen, you're fired.
It was not my decision.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.665
You understand that, do not you?

06:34.080 --> 06:37.001
You need professional help.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.429
I'm sorry James.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.685
So when we play?
-Igrati?

06:59.720 --> 07:02.910
Well, you know, taking
Flag, War Games...

07:03.760 --> 07:07.581
Oh yeah. Yes, over the weekend. Cool,

07:08.200 --> 07:12.000
On the net I seek locations.

07:12.035 --> 07:15.207
So, We'll do something like
trespassing?

07:15.360 --> 07:20.127
Theoretically, I'd
that our stay there on the edge...

07:20.162 --> 07:24.365
Patterns? Sorry.

07:24.400 --> 07:28.246
It is absolutely cool. It's okay.

07:35.240 --> 07:40.344
Hi bro. Where are the breasts?
-Stella, These are my friends.

07:40.760 --> 07:46.199
Yes, my friend, who is Muckitusse?
How nice. Inside put...

07:46.234 --> 07:48.863
turn, throw the key.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.001
Stella.

07:51.520 --> 07:55.967
Lesbian. So, Earl, old,
you have for us? Where is the new location?

07:56.160 --> 07:59.341
I have a few places on my list.

07:59.376 --> 08:02.485
Has a great location in the woods, for example.

08:02.520 --> 08:07.085
Oh no, not again. Come on, I hate nature,
man. Give me something without trees.

08:07.120 --> 08:11.564
Okay. Well, how about...
with the failed primary school?

08:11.760 --> 08:15.485
Lancaster. It says that it is closed

08:15.520 --> 08:20.801
because the two children died after
were the principal's office.

08:21.160 --> 08:26.149
That sounds pretty  uncool. Do you have anything
right? Come on. Yes, I have here is something else.

08:26.280 --> 08:30.922
Says, he has abandoned
a hospital complex or something.

08:30.957 --> 08:33.085
Says it was closed
10 years ago,

08:33.120 --> 08:36.966
Having a firm
the parent company moved overseas.

08:37.001 --> 08:41.864
Commercial pigs. You mean, let
kind of eerie empty hospital?

08:42.120 --> 08:47.001
Who knows, it seems
that has a reputation for odd

08:47.036 --> 08:49.245
but the complex is huge.

08:49.280 --> 08:54.365
About 20,000 square meters with a lot
rooms and several floors. Cool.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.085
And there's still a whole lot of things,

08:57.120 --> 09:02.142
Such that all personnel
left to lie and fled.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.165
Yes, this is the right place.

09:06.200 --> 09:09.682
I do not know whether we should really...
I, the complex is very secured

09:09.717 --> 09:12.481
and closed, and it will not be easy
get in there.

09:12.680 --> 09:15.726
In addition, we do not know
what's inside, and we're not looking for...

09:15.800 --> 09:19.661
We're not looking for trouble, are not you?
Hey dude, we never tržimo trouble.

09:19.696 --> 09:23.087
But they always fail,
to be found by us.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.962
Super. Wow.

09:45.200 --> 09:50.166
Hey! How are you?
-Užasno.

09:52.320 --> 09:57.811

Have you already said Dillon?

09:58.560 --> 10:03.687
Not. What do I say?
It really sucks when you think about it.

10:04.040 --> 10:08.011
What do you think

10:08.046 --> 10:10.525
No, I... no, I mean, I'd rather not.

10:10.560 --> 10:14.929
In the hospital we will be creepy,
and we play paintball.

10:14.964 --> 10:17.807

10:30.000 --> 10:34.564

This is probably my eternal destiny.
-Okej, Okay, okay.

10:38.520 --> 10:42.567

I want to hear from you.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.805

15:16.120 --> 15:19.464

15:20.120 --> 15:23.171
I wonder all the time
but she just crying.

15:23.240 --> 15:26.981

18:05.280 --> 18:09.082
Earlier it, but no longer.

Spike Lee for his first film
did not need or 30,000.

18:13.378 --> 18:16.906
Robby Rodriguez or 10,000. And Oren Peli?

18:17.000 --> 18:21.346
Best of all, Oren Peli
of paranormal activity?

18:21.680 --> 18:26.483
He has invested just $ 20,000
and earned 200 million.

18:27.200 --> 18:33.169
It is no longer a thing, baby.
I feel that success goes to me.

Wow, this'll all be killed.
Small Mask lady And the fire.

20:05.840 --> 20:08.446
Did I actually said,
to play paintball?

20:08.481 --> 20:10.544
No, but I think it's really cool.

20:10.760 --> 20:13.742
But, in fact, never
I have not played paintball.

20:13.880 --> 20:17.681
Really? Do not. Never mind, it's easy
. You just have to...

20:17.720 --> 20:21.745
Target your opponent
and shoot him.

20:22.240 --> 20:25.601
Well, if only that,
easily. Or did not.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.685
Sometimes Kyle really bum.

20:27.720 --> 20:31.742
Sometimes? And what is
rest of the time? Yeah...

20:37.080 --> 20:38.965
I really do not know what you mean.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.165
You're funny. This should be fun.
Tell me what I should do.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.065
Dillon, we have to get out.
I have no signal here.

20:46.160 --> 20:49.130
Let's go out?
This is not going to do anything. Are you going?

20:49.165 --> 20:52.451
Oh well. I'm going fast.
I will not stay long.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.307
Yeah, right.

20:58.360 --> 21:04.364
Other're alone. Never mind. It is also good
this. Joint? No, thank you. Yes, show me.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.981
"War-profit, Toxic chemicals"

21:28.360 --> 21:32.264
Say, Earl, how did
hell found this cabin?

21:32.400 --> 21:36.291
On the Internet, where else?
Kyle refused to go back into the woods

21:36.326 --> 21:42.765
so we looked for,
and this is kind of creepy.

21:43.320 --> 21:46.841
I know that the parent company moved

21:46.876 --> 21:51.463
but certainly here
something else happened.

21:51.920 --> 21:55.583
Really looks like
ideal place for horror fans.

21:55.618 --> 21:59.246
Yes, really. I would not be surprising
that some of them here.

21:59.281 --> 22:01.965
Do you think there are ghosts here?

22:02.120 --> 22:06.601
Why does everybody always ask?
Listen, if I find anything

22:06.636 --> 22:11.083
Does not belong here,
then I will certainly tell. Okay?

22:11.118 --> 22:15.182
What you got? It's just
simple, rough map.

22:15.217 --> 22:17.965
I usually take my sketch of the net,

22:18.000 --> 22:22.021
but the details of this property
somehow are not logged.

22:22.440 --> 22:25.026
Strange, is not it?

22:25.680 --> 22:28.689
Yes, it is probably here haunted.

22:44.960 --> 22:49.685
Okay, ladies, this right here is
paintball gun. -Pristaje You.

22:49.720 --> 22:52.883
Thank you. Now I'll show you
how to shoot with it, okay?

22:52.918 --> 22:55.581
I need just a little more
target, but the target

22:55.616 --> 22:59.845
you guess right.
Okay, I'll show you how it goes.

23:06.640 --> 23:10.045
Did you all see that?
Do you want to try? Sure.

23:10.080 --> 23:13.265
Then come on here and collapsed.
Let's see how it works.

23:13.300 --> 23:17.205
Only firmly held, firmly.
A little aim, yes.

23:17.240 --> 23:19.761
A little more...

23:21.200 --> 23:24.466
Oops. In addition.
-It'll Get better.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.423
Each one starts with a paintball.

23:36.880 --> 23:39.711
"Hail Satan"

23:45.880 --> 23:48.006
Wow.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.506
Look at this.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.862
I wonder why this one is not thrown.

23:55.960 --> 24:00.169
What kind of owner left
all this trash here?

24:05.040 --> 24:09.186
My God. With this
can wake the dead.

24:09.440 --> 24:12.463
Dude, I just hope
you're wrong.

24:17.120 --> 24:20.642
Easy, nice and easy. Nice right.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.725
Okay, I suggest that
GET CONNECTED stake.

24:23.760 --> 24:28.791
us your killer serious
understand. What do you think? It's okay. Okay.

24:28.880 --> 24:34.047
Yes, girls against boys in paintball
duel losers take off clothes.

24:34.240 --> 24:38.970
Cool, it's sexy,
whoa, baby we are.

24:39.400 --> 24:44.484

Shit.

30:11.240 --> 30:14.030
Sounds like something coming at us.

30:14.880 --> 30:19.986
This is not good. Not good.
Do not breathe. Do not breathe.

30:33.960 --> 30:37.027
Here you are, then. -Stella!

30:37.360 --> 30:40.489

What are you doing down here?

30:40.524 --> 30:45.902
These guys and these guys are organized Strip

30:46.000 --> 30:47.725
Great, and the girls were topless.

30:47.760 --> 30:50.744
Yes, when the boys were

30:50.779 --> 30:53.729
I wanted to see where the two of you.

30:54.440 --> 30:56.265
And as far Bridget?

30:56.320 --> 31:00.620
It is located somewhere in the corner.
I left orgies

31:00.655 --> 31:04.920
and went to investigate.
I scared you, did not you?

31:04.955 --> 31:07.810
No, no, we were just
careful, nothing else.

31:07.845 --> 31:09.987
That's why you need a lamp

31:10.022 --> 31:12.430
hide in the dark and wrote in gaæe.

31:12.520 --> 31:15.967
Okay, I do not know about you,
but I'm starving.

31:16.002 --> 31:18.724
I suggest that we go up and eat.

31:18.800 --> 31:22.407

Now some of it, honey.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.645
Wow. Again you have your pants?

31:55.680 --> 31:58.570

Body sees, as if it was designed by Michelangelo
.

32:02.600 --> 32:05.683
Michelangelo. Do

32:51.280 --> 32:53.469
Yes, so far is fun.

32:53.560 --> 32:57.201
Dillon, I'm sorry, I did
somehow good will.

32:57.236 --> 33:00.670
Somehow? You must have a curse, right?

33:00.840 --> 33:03.407
No, Dillon,
I do not have my period, right?

33:03.480 --> 33:08.281
I can tell you quite clearly
mean, I do not have my period.

33:08.316 --> 33:10.361
OK.

33:11.840 --> 33:16.721
As the official Team Captain Red,
also known as "Star Power"

33:16.756 --> 33:20.027
now I choose
members of my unit.

33:20.320 --> 33:22.385

34:23.440 --> 34:25.442

34:29.440 --> 34:34.446
I was captain last month
and we had a lot of fun. Yes.

34:35.159 --> 34:37.565
We had fun because we were doing it right.

34:37.600 --> 34:41.571
And this time we'll do it properly.
I've got a flag, and Earl

34:41.606 --> 34:46.123

I will give you a blue flag.

34:46.560 --> 34:48.750

34:54.080 --> 34:57.743
So, officially
game starts at midnight.

34:57.760 --> 35:01.782
When the needle pointed to 12,
let's all or nothing.

35:01.920 --> 35:06.245
And since then, everyone is left
himself. Is that clear? Then we'll go.

35:06.280 --> 35:10.205
And the best part is that both teams
immediately go to their camps.

35:10.240 --> 35:15.249
And prepare.
-Ratne Games, war games!

35:17.000 --> 35:20.224
War orgasm, orgasm war!

35:37.920 --> 35:40.605
So Will Power.

35:42.400 --> 35:45.246
If she came to me...

35:46.880 --> 35:49.264
Yes. Yes.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.107
OK.

35:59.480 --> 36:02.609
I do not like this.
We must protect this place better.

36:02.644 --> 36:05.810
Pull up a chair and put her
here before the exit, right?

36:05.920 --> 36:08.751
We need to build barricades
which must be secure.

36:08.786 --> 36:12.209
No one may enter here.
No one can not come in here.

36:12.280 --> 36:14.944
Kyle, do not be so
very secure flag.

36:14.979 --> 36:18.008
If we're careful
blue team is not going to climb any stairs.

36:18.040 --> 36:20.965
I hear you well,
my big brother, you're right

36:21.000 --> 36:25.160
but we want to win, because
must take all precautions.

36:25.195 --> 36:29.051
Right, brother. I mean,
meditate as the blue team.

36:29.086 --> 36:30.830
They have no chance.

36:30.920 --> 36:34.725
They Earl, Bridget,
Mendel Ricky, Dillon and lesbian.

36:34.760 --> 36:38.960
You're right, it's these pickles,
but this is a war game.

36:39.040 --> 36:43.443
We want to win.
I Power Star team will be the winner.

36:43.478 --> 36:46.569
That's right, man. Let's do it.

36:46.720 --> 36:48.785
Star Power!

36:49.120 --> 36:52.408
This is great.
Maybe will even work.

36:53.800 --> 36:58.629
Let .
Kyle, the girls have an idea!

36:58.840 --> 37:01.605
Girls have an idea?
What they may have an idea?

37:01.640 --> 37:04.765
Hence, we found
that we do not know the path to the camp

37:04.800 --> 37:09.930
blue team, and we thought you'd
we could not show it.

37:09.960 --> 37:12.770
No problem,
wait, here is a map.

37:12.805 --> 37:15.365
I gotta go just this way.

37:15.400 --> 37:18.870
I think you did not
understood, Kyle.

37:18.960 --> 37:22.286
I thought the little
and research mission.

37:24.880 --> 37:30.325
In order to speed looking around
Yes, exactly, you pametnjakoviæu.

37:30.360 --> 37:33.923
And Randall, would you like
look around?

37:33.960 --> 37:38.531
Hey, one thick and one inside
thin out.

37:38.560 --> 37:41.800
So, ladies, let
stretch. Come on.

37:41.835 --> 37:45.904
Fun, I'll stay
in the database. I got this here...

37:55.680 --> 37:59.685
So, here we are. Still in shape.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.161
Dillon...

38:11.800 --> 38:16.066
What's going on? We have always been open
each other? Why are we now?

38:16.101 --> 38:18.947
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

38:21.480 --> 38:24.764
I never wanted to do something between us stands.

38:24.799 --> 38:28.549
Then it's my fault.
What is it? What have I done?

38:28.800 --> 38:33.624
Yes. You're right, partly
is also your fault.

38:33.880 --> 38:37.948
But in fact it is
more my fault.

38:38.160 --> 38:41.325
I think we're both wrong.

38:43.600 --> 38:50.848
Whatever it is, you tell me.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.945
I'm pregnant.

39:06.960 --> 39:12.466
This is not bad news.
We will be the best parents in the world.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.728
I do not... What?

39:19.680 --> 39:22.931
I was so afraid to tell you.

39:25.320 --> 39:32.842
You're so cool, so I was afraid that I
therefore lose.

39:32.877 --> 39:37.450
It's impossible. Look, I love you.

39:38.520 --> 39:43.469
Without you I do not want to go anywhere,
Bridget. We will establish a family.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.968
Yes.

39:56.720 --> 40:01.469
Honey, I have a little surprise for you
.

40:01.680 --> 40:04.703
Not now honey, I have to watch.

40:11.320 --> 40:18.130
See, what I found.
One for you and one for me.

40:18.440 --> 40:21.047
I can not now.

40:23.520 --> 40:27.624
The fate of the red team
lies in my capable hands.

40:29.520 --> 40:31.226
I do not want to lose.

40:31.280 --> 40:36.348
Why do not you just take this
here in your capable hands?

40:37.480 --> 40:41.009
Hell. Odvraæaš
me from my duties.

40:42.720 --> 40:45.785
And my body was weak.

40:53.280 --> 40:55.911
Oh, how cute.

41:01.320 --> 41:04.381
I have to record it.

41:12.160 --> 41:14.565
Let's do it. Can we?

41:14.600 --> 41:18.332
Of course, we have until midnight.
Do you think I'll endure for so long?

47:16.200 --> 47:19.864
What is it? Something is odd.

47:20.040 --> 47:25.885
