00:02.219 --> 00:03.873
[Gossip Girl]
Gossip Girl here,
your one and only source

00:03.960 --> 00:05.483
into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.

00:05.570 --> 00:07.442
I actually thought this time
would be different.

00:07.529 --> 00:09.531
But you're just the same girl
you always were.

00:09.618 --> 00:11.011
It's stupid for you
to want her

00:11.098 --> 00:13.491
to be anything other
than she is.

00:13.578 --> 00:15.624
[Dan]
'No, she just needs someone
to believe in her.'

00:15.711 --> 00:18.192
Dan was denied
financial aid at Yale.

00:18.279 --> 00:19.758
I mean, I could
help you out.

00:19.845 --> 00:21.238
I think this is something
I have to handle on my own.

00:21.325 --> 00:22.413
I'm Gabriel.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.849
'Gabriel and poppy were over.'

00:23.936 --> 00:25.460
And it's not like either one
of us planned this.

00:25.547 --> 00:26.896
This-this thing between us
just happened

00:26.983 --> 00:28.289
and we couldn't stop it.

00:28.376 --> 00:29.464
Would you like to join us?

00:29.551 --> 00:30.552
I'd love to meet the people

00:30.639 --> 00:31.901
in Serena's life.

00:33.555 --> 00:34.730
[Gossip Girl]
Where has she..

00:34.817 --> 00:36.688
And who am I?

00:36.775 --> 00:39.865
That's a secret
I'll never tell.

00:39.952 --> 00:41.563
You know you love me.

00:41.650 --> 00:44.479
XOXO, Gossip Girl.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.744
Eventually,
every queen finds herself

00:48.831 --> 00:52.704
in unfamiliar territory
outside the castle walls.

00:52.791 --> 00:55.620
In Blair Waldorf's case,
the Village.

00:55.707 --> 00:58.493
[Blair]
NYU? What was I thinking?

00:58.580 --> 01:00.712
You know how I feel
about ironic facial hair.

01:00.799 --> 01:02.497
Well, you were thinking
that A, you're lucky

01:02.584 --> 01:05.456
to get into a school at all
and B, you're super lucky

01:05.543 --> 01:06.805
'cause where you got
in happens to be in the same

01:06.892 --> 01:08.416
city as your fantastic
boyfriend.

01:08.503 --> 01:10.113
That's true.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.810
[Nate]
'I've been coming
down here for years'

01:11.897 --> 01:13.334
'and I'm gonna teach you
everything you need to know.'

01:13.421 --> 01:15.858
The best latte, the best slice,
the best pot dealer.

01:15.945 --> 01:18.556
But first, themost important
lesson of all.

01:18.643 --> 01:20.297
How to ride the subway.

01:22.952 --> 01:24.606
Nate, you're sweet..

01:24.693 --> 01:26.956
but obviously, you've inhaled
too much patchouli.

01:27.043 --> 01:29.001
There's no way
I'm going down there.

01:29.089 --> 01:32.309
It's full of mole men
and middle-class professionals.

01:32.396 --> 01:33.658
Well, you have to learn.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.095
How else are you gonna
visit me at Columbia?

01:35.182 --> 01:37.184
Why do you think
God gave us car service?

01:37.271 --> 01:39.273
Our schools are at opposite
poles of Manhattan.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.926
I mean, in traffic,
it could take hours.

01:41.013 --> 01:42.667
The subway's definitely
the quickest way.

01:42.754 --> 01:44.147
Please don't ask
this of me.

01:48.282 --> 01:51.154
[instrumental music]

01:53.200 --> 01:54.505
[Rufus]
'Anything you want, Dan.'

01:54.592 --> 01:57.160
You're graduating high school
that's a big deal.

01:57.247 --> 01:59.945
How about a trunk?
Trunks are great for storage.

02:00.032 --> 02:01.817
Books, you're gonna have
a lot of books at college.

02:01.904 --> 02:05.168
Hey, Jenny, maybe you need
a trunk, too. Any one you want.

02:05.255 --> 02:08.867
Dad, what's with this newfound
interest in antiquing?

02:08.954 --> 02:10.217
Oh, I'm just stimulating
the economy

02:10.304 --> 02:12.567
by rewarding
my fantastic kids

02:12.654 --> 02:15.178
and it so happens that the, uh,
gallery was a great investment.

02:15.265 --> 02:16.832
It's listing for three times
what I paid for.

02:16.919 --> 02:18.921
You didn't get soaked when
the real estate bubble burst?

02:19.008 --> 02:20.705
Well, it's not as much as
I would've gotten at the top

02:20.792 --> 02:22.751
of the market but I'll be able
to send you both to school

02:22.838 --> 02:23.969
and have a little breathing room

02:24.056 --> 02:25.275
to figure out
what I want to do next.

02:25.362 --> 02:26.972
Consider cooking classes?

02:27.059 --> 02:28.539
I mean, even I'm getting
tired of your waffles, dad.

02:28.626 --> 02:30.541
Not cool.
I sometimes make chili.

02:32.935 --> 02:34.458
It looks a little
delicate for your hand.

02:34.545 --> 02:35.851
[Rufus]
'Don't get any ideas, big shot.'

02:35.938 --> 02:36.895
[cellphone ringing]
I'm just looking.

02:38.419 --> 02:40.421
It's Lily. One sec.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.379
Hey

02:42.466 --> 02:43.641
Hey.

02:46.427 --> 02:47.950
Check out what dad
was looking at.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.261
Rats go underground.
Not Waldorfs.

02:54.348 --> 02:56.480
Well, you can always
borrow Chuck's helicopter.

02:56.567 --> 02:57.873
Kidding.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.919
Chuck, what a waste
of time that was.

03:01.006 --> 03:02.225
You know, it's not
a real relationship

03:02.312 --> 03:04.445
if you can't hold hands.

03:04.532 --> 03:07.099
Oh, but Nate is good to me.
Good forme.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.492
And he's learned
a thing or two.

03:08.579 --> 03:11.191
Hmm. So being a kept man
does have its perks.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.714
Yeah, but no man is worth

03:12.801 --> 03:15.195
suffering the indignity
of mass transit.

03:15.282 --> 03:16.587
How's the foreigner?

03:16.674 --> 03:18.502
Blair, Gabriel
is from North Carolina.

03:18.589 --> 03:20.591
- That's in the United States.
- Not by choice.

03:20.678 --> 03:22.767
Let me remind you of a little
thing called the Civil War.

03:22.854 --> 03:24.639
[chuckles]

03:24.726 --> 03:26.293
Everything
with Gabriel is perfect.

03:26.380 --> 03:28.077
No strings, no demands

03:28.164 --> 03:31.298
except he is so focused
on building his new company

03:31.385 --> 03:33.387
that he can never commit
to anything

03:33.474 --> 03:35.258
dinner reservations, movies.

03:35.345 --> 03:36.955
Sometimes, he'll get a text
for a meeting

03:37.042 --> 03:38.783
and then, poof, he's gone.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.568
Well, if it's casual
like you say

03:40.655 --> 03:42.831
no strings,
then what do you expect?

03:42.918 --> 03:44.833
It's not like you're gonna
marry the guy.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.704
I kind of did marry him.

03:46.791 --> 03:47.749
[laughing]

03:49.185 --> 03:50.708
We got carried away.
I talked to Cyrus.

03:50.795 --> 03:51.753
He said it doesn't count.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.929
Let me get this straight.

03:54.016 --> 03:56.279
He goads you into making
the ultimate commitment

03:56.366 --> 03:58.107
and now he can't stick it out
through a whole dinner?

03:58.194 --> 04:01.502
He didn't goad me.
It was romantic.

04:01.589 --> 04:03.286
Gabriel is disappearing
for a reason.

04:03.373 --> 04:04.374
We need to get
to the bottom of it.

04:04.461 --> 04:06.768
- No, we don't.
- Oh, come on!

04:06.855 --> 04:08.465
Let's follow him tonight.

04:08.552 --> 04:10.467
We can dress up,
use code names.

04:10.554 --> 04:13.035
Dorota is a great help
with surveillance equipment.

04:13.122 --> 04:14.254
Doesn't that sound
at all fun?

04:14.341 --> 04:15.864
No, not even a smidgen.

04:17.518 --> 04:20.782
So what exactly
areyou guys doing tonight?

04:22.827 --> 04:24.176
No.

04:29.225 --> 04:32.228
Well, you suck
more than usual today.

04:32.315 --> 04:33.664
A little distracted.

04:35.231 --> 04:37.059
- Things with--
- It's okay.

04:37.146 --> 04:39.279
- You can say her name.
- Blair.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.194
I feel weird talking
about her with you.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.109
Nathaniel,
she's your girlfriend.

04:44.196 --> 04:45.197
If we wanna be friends
like we were

04:45.285 --> 04:46.808
it's just part
of the deal.

04:46.895 --> 04:48.505
So it's okay to just talk
about her guy to guy

04:48.592 --> 04:50.115
like we used to?

04:50.202 --> 04:51.813
Well, I was there for you
last week, wasn't I?

04:55.077 --> 04:56.731
Yeah, you were.

04:56.818 --> 04:58.907
I think next year's gonna be
harder than I thought, you know?

04:58.994 --> 05:00.430
With me in Morningside Heights
and her all the way down

05:00.517 --> 05:01.431
in the Village, it's basically
like we're

05:01.518 --> 05:02.998
in a long-distance relationship.

05:03.085 --> 05:04.434
Well, it's too bad
you don't have a place

05:04.521 --> 05:07.219
in the middle like my room
at the palace.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.134
Say the word,
and she can crash with me.

05:09.221 --> 05:12.268
- That's not funny.
- You're right. I'm sorry.

05:12.355 --> 05:15.880
But, Archibald, let's face it,
you won. I lost.

05:15.967 --> 05:18.100
You have nothing
to worry about with me.

05:18.187 --> 05:19.841
I'm out of that game.

05:19.928 --> 05:21.973
Well, I certainly
don't have to worry

05:22.060 --> 05:24.541
about your weak-ass
jumper, do I?

05:27.849 --> 05:29.764
And then my grandfather says,
if it's menthol you want

05:29.851 --> 05:31.505
it's menthol you're gonna get.

05:31.592 --> 05:34.159
I didn't know your family
was in the tobacco industry.

05:34.246 --> 05:35.639
Yeah, they are but Gabriel
doesn't want

05:35.726 --> 05:36.988
anything to do with it.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.468
They were grooming me
to take over

05:38.555 --> 05:39.730
but I had to break out
on my own

05:39.817 --> 05:41.253
and do something positive.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.081
'So I started researching
new technologies'

05:43.168 --> 05:44.953
and found a company that wants
to provide wireless access

05:45.040 --> 05:47.608
to the developing world,
so I've been backing them.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.436
I mean, it sounds like
such a good thing

05:49.523 --> 05:52.917
but to my family,
it is betrayal.

05:53.004 --> 05:55.442
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Family is so important.

05:55.529 --> 05:57.182
[cellphone ringing]

05:57.269 --> 06:00.751
Excuse me. Oh, I asked the
caterer for a '99 Brunello.

06:00.838 --> 06:02.405
'This isn't a PTA meeting.'

06:02.492 --> 06:04.451
Though nothing's as important
as the right wine.

06:04.538 --> 06:07.192
Look, I apologize, I'm hosting
the co-op meeting tomorrow

06:07.279 --> 06:09.543
'and it'll be an hour-long
battle over lobby renovations'

06:09.630 --> 06:11.501
'followed by cocktails
and appetizers.'

06:11.588 --> 06:14.025
You're welcome to join us.
Keep Serena company.

06:14.112 --> 06:15.984
Oh, yes, please do.

06:16.071 --> 06:18.203
- I'd be honored.
- Hey, who's up for a movie?

06:18.290 --> 06:19.640
- Yeah.
- Yes.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.032
Do you know what?
That sounds lovely

06:21.119 --> 06:23.644
but I'm sorry,
I-I have some work to do.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.863
So this has been great,
thank you very much.

06:25.950 --> 06:28.213
- But I'm afraid I've to go.
- Oh.

06:31.521 --> 06:33.262
Gabriel, it's a movie.

06:33.349 --> 06:35.525
You know, most of 'em are only
like, 80 minutes these days.

06:35.612 --> 06:38.136
And you know that there's
nothing else I'd rather do

06:38.223 --> 06:41.792
but I'm a little behind
on reviewing the prospectus.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.315
This is important to me.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.187
Yeah, and you spending
time with my family

06:45.274 --> 06:46.623
is important to me.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.364
My deal
will be closed soon

06:48.451 --> 06:50.627
and then I'm all yours,
I promise.

06:53.195 --> 06:54.196
I'll see you tomorrow.

06:54.283 --> 06:56.067
Let me get my coat.

06:56.154 --> 06:58.113
[cellphone ringing]

06:58.200 --> 07:01.072
[instrumental music]

07:20.875 --> 07:21.876
Blair.

07:24.748 --> 07:27.185
I see you're wearing
your beret.

07:28.535 --> 07:29.753
Who are we spying
on tonight?

07:29.840 --> 07:31.451
Serena's shady southerner.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.975
Well, I can't say
he does much for me, either.

07:34.062 --> 07:35.324
But why the intrigue?

07:35.411 --> 07:37.326
'Don't tell me,
not enough drama'

07:37.413 --> 07:39.546
in domestic bliss with Nate?

07:39.633 --> 07:41.591
You know, when people
step outside their relationship

07:41.678 --> 07:44.812
for a thrill, it's usually
not alone and in the dark.

07:44.899 --> 07:48.206
I happen to be worried
about my best friend.

07:48.293 --> 07:50.774
Serena said Gabriel
just disappears. Poof!

07:50.861 --> 07:52.863
Well, I'm gonna find out
where he's poofing to.

07:52.950 --> 07:55.126
And besides, it's good
for couples

07:55.213 --> 07:56.563
to have different interests.

07:56.650 --> 07:57.781
Shh!

08:00.871 --> 08:03.308
This feels eerily familiar.

08:05.223 --> 08:06.747
Shut up!Look.

08:06.834 --> 08:09.271
[gasps]Poppy?

08:09.358 --> 08:10.968
[Gossip Girl]
And when a queen discovers

08:11.055 --> 08:14.232
her best maiden
is with a dragon in disguise

08:14.319 --> 08:18.106
the only thing to do is pull up
the drawbridge and trap him.

08:18.193 --> 08:20.369
metaphorically, of course.

08:23.981 --> 08:25.330
You have to dump him!

08:25.417 --> 08:27.071
We caught that redneck
red-handed.

08:27.158 --> 08:28.899
Well, B, obviously
I'm not thrilled

08:28.986 --> 08:31.511
but I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this on my own.

08:31.598 --> 08:33.295
Now why can't you worry
about your own relationship

08:33.382 --> 08:34.644
'problems for a change?'

08:34.731 --> 08:36.254
What does that
supposed to mean?

08:36.341 --> 08:39.649
It was Friday night and you were
out spying on my boyfriend

08:39.736 --> 08:41.782
instead of seeing a movie
or something.

08:41.869 --> 08:44.654
Why can't anybody
see a movie around here?

08:47.439 --> 08:48.702
I have to call you later.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.618
Serena, there's something
you should know.

08:54.882 --> 08:55.970
Last night I was..

08:56.057 --> 08:57.928
Spying on that boyfriend
of Serena's.

08:58.015 --> 08:59.669
- Philanderer!
- Really.

08:59.756 --> 09:00.931
Chuck and I saw him
with Poppy.

09:01.018 --> 09:01.932
Wait. Chuck?

09:03.194 --> 09:04.152
You were with Chuck?

09:04.239 --> 09:05.196
Yeah, we ran into each other

09:05.283 --> 09:07.242
outside the building.

09:07.329 --> 09:08.373
- Oh.
- It's not a big deal.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.332
You know that, right?

09:10.419 --> 09:13.422
Yeah. Of course.
It's no big deal.

09:13.509 --> 09:16.817
Good, because unlike some
people we know, Serena

09:16.904 --> 09:20.037
we have a relationship
without secrets or lying.

09:20.124 --> 09:21.038
Yeah, I know.

09:22.823 --> 09:25.129
- We're really lucky.
- Good.

- Sure.

09:30.613 --> 09:32.310
Are you sleeping
with her?

09:32.397 --> 09:34.617
No. No.

09:34.704 --> 09:37.446
Not since I met you.

09:37.533 --> 09:40.144
I told her
that I just needed space

09:40.231 --> 09:41.885
and time to think.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.539
But the truth is, I'd-I'd just

09:43.626 --> 09:46.498
like to never see her again.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.630
You know, when I first
came to New York

09:47.717 --> 09:50.111
I didn't know many people.

in my company are hercontacts.

out about us'

09:53.680 --> 09:54.637
'she threatened to pull them.'

09:56.247 --> 09:57.553
So I told her
that you and I were over.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.035

the truth..

10:03.733 --> 10:05.605

I could lose everything.

10:53.261 --> 10:55.132
I will tell her everything.

10:57.308 --> 11:00.268

it'll cushion the blow.

He didn't buy.

12:07.117 --> 12:08.989
He chickened out. Why?

12:09.076 --> 12:10.860
Maybe because Jenny
basically told him

she'd never move
in with the VD-dubs.

and maybe you've already
been in there.

18:54.437 --> 18:56.570
Blair, what are you doing?

19:00.922 --> 19:02.619
- Poppy.
- Gabriel.

19:04.882 --> 19:06.057
Oh.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.756
Nice. I knew it.

19:08.843 --> 19:10.540
Poppy, I know.
We-we need to talk.

19:10.627 --> 19:11.933
'What do you want
to talk about?'

19:12.020 --> 19:13.326
The fact that you stole
my boyfriend?

19:13.413 --> 19:14.936
I didn't steal him.
You left.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.633
You know what? Don't.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.157
'Cause it's not even you
that I'm mad at. It's him.

19:18.244 --> 19:21.638
You are a lying, cheating,
I am gonna kill you!

19:21.725 --> 19:24.337
No one's killing anyone.
It's a co-op cocktail party.

19:24.424 --> 19:26.382
What an idiot I am!

19:26.469 --> 19:28.950
'Using my connections
for your company?'

19:29.037 --> 19:31.648
Poppy, it is not like that.
You know it's not.

19:31.735 --> 19:34.608
Then leave with me.
Right now.

19:34.695 --> 19:37.263
'And if you don't,
I will call every investor'

19:37.350 --> 19:39.308
and tell them
to take their money back.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.927
Poppy, you and I are done.

19:50.014 --> 19:52.147
Things haven't been good
with us for a long time.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.105
And I'm sorry.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.585
'But Serena didn't steal me.'

19:57.283 --> 19:58.893
She swept me away.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.767
'You tell your investors
whatever you want.'

20:03.854 --> 20:05.813
[sniffles]

20:05.900 --> 20:07.075
Fine.

20:08.859 --> 20:11.297
I'll tell them the truth.
That you're ruined.

20:13.299 --> 20:14.909
Goodbye, Gabriel.

20:20.697 --> 20:22.221
Gabriel..

20:22.308 --> 20:23.352
I'm sorry. I just..

20:23.439 --> 20:25.180
I need a minute
to clear my head.

20:26.616 --> 20:29.532
Well, I guess
he really likes you.

20:29.619 --> 20:32.753
- At least now we know.
- I'll deal with you later.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.017
- Oops.
- Hmm.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.456
♪ It's been so long ♪

20:40.543 --> 20:41.631
Hello.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.113

did my apartment

20:45.200 --> 20:47.289
become your watering
hole of choice?

20:47.376 --> 20:49.073
Rufus and Jenny let me
in on their way out.

20:49.160 --> 20:50.249
I thought
I'd wait for you

20:50.336 --> 20:52.599
maybe play a little,
I never.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.514
Oh.

20:54.601 --> 20:56.516
I-I kind of already started.

20:56.603 --> 20:57.604
Yeah, I can see that.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.389
[sighing]

21:00.476 --> 21:02.391
- I'll go first.
- Alright.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.526
I never slept
with Chuck Bass.

21:13.359 --> 21:14.490
That's why
I've been avoiding you.

21:14.577 --> 21:17.145
I know. It's repulsive.

21:17.232 --> 21:20.801
It is completely repulsive,
but you didn't..

21:20.888 --> 21:22.455
but you-you-you've been
going through a lot lately.

21:22.542 --> 21:25.066
I mean, the whole Blair-Nate
reunion and all and..

21:25.153 --> 21:27.286
Plus the whole looking up
while looking down thing

21:27.373 --> 21:29.157
really had
a certain appeal to it.

21:29.244 --> 21:30.724
So you-you get
no judgment from me.

21:30.811 --> 21:33.683
Everyone makes a mistake
at least once.

21:33.770 --> 21:36.773
I never...nearly slept with
Georgina Sparks.

21:36.860 --> 21:37.992
[chuckles]

21:39.907 --> 21:41.909
I never slept
with Chuck Bass twice.

21:41.996 --> 21:43.867
[coughs]

21:43.954 --> 21:45.652
Mm-hmm.

21:47.958 --> 21:49.569
Dan, you're lucky.

21:49.656 --> 21:51.527
However bad your life
sucks right now

21:51.614 --> 21:53.442
you didn't need
an STD panel this week.

21:53.529 --> 21:55.401
[chuckles]

21:55.488 --> 21:57.228
- Oh.
- Yeah, there's that.

21:58.752 --> 22:00.188
Wait, why does my life
suck right now?

22:01.624 --> 22:03.887
So, you going
to Lily's now?

22:03.974 --> 22:05.802
Yeah, the co-op meeting
should be done by now.

22:05.889 --> 22:07.761
And there's a party after.
You should come.

22:07.848 --> 22:09.719
No offense.
That sounds really boring

22:09.806 --> 22:11.808
especially with Eric
being out of town.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.682
So, uh..

22:15.769 --> 22:18.119
You kinda haven't been
yourself tonight.

22:18.206 --> 22:21.078
All day, actually. I mean,
is everything alright?

22:21.165 --> 22:22.732
I'm just a little tired,
but I'm fine.

22:24.865 --> 22:27.694
You're not.
And I know why.

22:27.781 --> 22:29.130
Jenny, whatever you think
you know--

22:29.217 --> 22:31.915
I know that you want
to propose to Lily.

22:32.002 --> 22:34.831
And I want you to know that Dan
and I are totally okay with it.

22:34.918 --> 22:36.877
But you have to let me make
the bridesmaid dresses, okay?

22:36.964 --> 22:40.707
I think those bridesmaid
dresses are a bit premature.

22:40.794 --> 22:42.665
Why? Dan saw you looking
at that ring yesterday.

22:42.752 --> 22:45.015
It's not a good time.
There are some, uh..

22:45.102 --> 22:47.496
Complicated things
happening right now.

22:49.629 --> 22:52.109
Well, whatever they are,
you can fix them.

22:52.196 --> 22:54.721
You just have to want
it bad enough.

22:54.808 --> 22:57.245
Dad, my whole life, you said
that I could do anything

22:57.332 --> 22:58.899
if I was willing to risk
falling flat on my face.

22:58.986 --> 23:01.423
So, why doesn't that
same advice apply to you?

23:03.251 --> 23:04.731
- Right?
- Good point.

23:04.818 --> 23:06.385
You know I'm right.

[Serena]
'Hey.'

23:19.789 --> 23:22.662
So, I'm really glad
you chose me over money.

23:22.749 --> 23:24.228
I never really
had a choice.

23:24.315 --> 23:25.969
I'm just glad everything's
out in the open.

23:26.056 --> 23:28.102
I'll go back to North Carolina
and work with my father.

23:28.189 --> 23:30.757
And maybe, he'll let me design
a public service campaign.

23:30.844 --> 23:33.063
Oh. I'm sorry.

23:33.150 --> 23:34.891
I know how hard
you've been working.

23:34.978 --> 23:36.110
Well, you shouldn't be.

23:36.197 --> 23:38.329
I 100% brought this
on myself.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.244
'I could have really made
a difference with this company.'

23:41.245 --> 23:42.943
And I have to admit

23:43.030 --> 23:45.554
I wanted to rub that money
in my father's face.

23:45.641 --> 23:47.904
It was that good
of a deal, huh?

23:47.991 --> 23:49.645
Poppy's investors would
have tripled their money

23:49.732 --> 23:51.691
by the end of summer.

23:51.778 --> 23:54.389
Well, then you have
to still do it.

23:54.476 --> 23:55.956
Come on, without you

23:56.043 --> 23:58.349
how else will all
of the African teenagers

23:58.437 --> 23:59.568
send in posts
to Gossip Girl?

23:59.655 --> 24:01.788
[chuckles]

24:01.875 --> 24:04.007
Poppy was serious about
calling off her investors.

24:04.094 --> 24:05.531
Well, then find new ones.

24:05.618 --> 24:07.315
Look around,
these are residents

24:07.402 --> 24:10.100
of one of the wealthiest co-ops
in Manhattan, and the smartest.

24:10.187 --> 24:12.407
Our board rejected Bernie Madoff
five years in a row.

I thought we found out
today was a mistake

24:13.800 --> 24:15.236
mixing business and pleasure.

24:15.323 --> 24:17.891
Please, I would be so proud
to help you.

24:17.978 --> 24:20.807
- Really? You sure?
- Yes, of course.

24:20.894 --> 24:23.766
- Let me go find my mom.
- Okay.

24:29.946 --> 24:31.513
The martinis are great, right?

24:31.600 --> 24:34.081
So, I heard you, uh,
first met Serena

24:34.168 --> 24:36.257
on one of her infamous
nights with Georgina.

24:36.344 --> 24:38.651
You know, I've always wanted
to know what happened.

24:38.738 --> 24:40.217
It must be quite the story.

24:41.305 --> 24:44.221
[instrumental music ]

24:49.488 --> 24:51.751
[gasps]Oh.

24:51.838 --> 24:54.144
Oh, Nate,
what are you doing here?

24:54.231 --> 24:55.668
I thought there
was a Mets game.

24:55.755 --> 24:57.234
I saw Dorota
wearing her hat.

24:57.321 --> 24:59.193
Yeah, I can just catch the
highlights on Sportscenter.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.803
I wanted to surprise you.

25:00.890 --> 25:03.763
- Are Chuck and Serena here?
- Somewhere.

25:03.850 --> 25:05.678
I can't believe I let him
talk me into operation

25:05.765 --> 25:07.593
gone with the weasel.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.769
It's a long story
and unimportant.

25:09.856 --> 25:12.511
What matters is how glad
I am you surprised me.

25:12.598 --> 25:15.122
Good. I'm not done.

25:15.209 --> 25:17.820
I know you're nervous about us
being far apart next year

25:17.907 --> 25:18.821
'so I got something.'

25:20.606 --> 25:21.911
It's a one-bedroom
in Murray Hill.

25:21.998 --> 25:23.347
Oh, my God.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.396
Will you move in with me?

25:28.483 --> 25:29.789
- Yes.
- Yeah?

25:29.876 --> 25:31.399
Yes, of course I will.

25:31.486 --> 25:33.444
You're moving in?

25:33.532 --> 25:36.012
Yes, she is. I'm taking
her there now, actually.

25:36.099 --> 25:38.537
Well, before you birds
fly off to your love nest

25:38.624 --> 25:40.713
there's something
you should know.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.629
Gabriel says he met Serena
the night before the SATs.

25:44.804 --> 25:46.762
He said they were at Butter.

25:46.849 --> 25:49.852
- No, that's impossible.
- I know.

25:49.939 --> 25:52.289
- We should go tell Serena.
- No, no, no, wait.

25:52.376 --> 25:53.769
Chuck can handle
this by himself.

25:53.856 --> 25:55.510
Why don't we go see
our apartment?

25:55.597 --> 25:58.252
Sometimes a queen
has to make a choice.

25:58.339 --> 26:02.865
A castle with a white knight
or a quest with a dark prince.

26:02.952 --> 26:04.867
So, B, what'll it be?

26:04.954 --> 26:08.741
Netflix night with Nate
or battling a beast with Bass?

26:12.092 --> 26:13.484
[Gabriel]
'The governments, the ISPs'

26:13.572 --> 26:15.878
and the big companies need
to use these satellites.

26:15.965 --> 26:17.358
We could be
the only game in town.

26:17.445 --> 26:19.360
'And it has
a charitable component, too.'

26:19.447 --> 26:20.970

'Well, this is just
the sort of thing'

26:24.278 --> 26:26.410
that some of us at Bass
have been pushing for.

26:26.497 --> 26:28.195
Doing well by doing good.

26:28.282 --> 26:30.850
Yes. But the only thing
is there's a ticking clock.

26:30.937 --> 26:32.112
Some of the major
internet corporations

26:32.199 --> 26:33.504
are pushing
to do a similar thing.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.159
If we act now,
we block them completely

26:36.246 --> 26:39.293
and we make at least
triple our investment.

26:39.380 --> 26:41.774
Gabriel, why don't you send
a prospectus to my assistant?

26:41.861 --> 26:43.427
Of course I have to look at it

26:43.514 --> 26:46.474
but, um, you can tell
your backers I'm in.

26:49.433 --> 26:50.609
[laughing]

26:52.349 --> 26:53.307
You were great!

26:53.394 --> 26:54.525
Now all you have to do

26:54.613 --> 26:55.526
is tell the rest
of the co-op members

26:55.614 --> 26:56.832
that she invested

26:56.919 --> 26:58.486
and with my mom's approval
you are golden.

26:58.573 --> 27:00.096

27:00.183 --> 27:02.621
I need to see
you in your room.

27:02.708 --> 27:03.970
Another tour?

27:12.152 --> 27:15.111
- He's lying to you.
- Seriously, you two, enough.

27:15.198 --> 27:17.026
He told Chuck that
he met you at Butter

27:17.113 --> 27:19.594
butIknow for a fact that
Butter was closed that night

27:19.681 --> 27:21.074
'because I used their bartender'

27:21.161 --> 27:22.858
for the Nelly Yuki
SAT sabotage party.

27:22.945 --> 27:25.252
Not that I need to explain
this to either of you

27:25.339 --> 27:26.993
but I was with Georgina
that night

27:27.080 --> 27:30.257
and she knows the manager, so
it was probably a private party

27:30.344 --> 27:32.607
or he just misremembered.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.653
Look, Chuck also saw him
making a secretive phone call.

Oh, wow. Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury

27:51.147 --> 27:52.192
Just face it, you two.

27:52.279 --> 27:53.410
You're using this as an excuse

27:53.497 --> 27:54.803
to get together again.

'I'm going back
to my boyfriend now.'

you'll go back to yours.

be a little easier on Rufus.'

would have killed him.

- Yeah, I know.
- You don't blame him, do you?

No, I-I blame
the financial aid office

...a certain imbecile

about this news than me.

29:03.350 --> 29:05.874
Man, he was so
excited about..

29:05.961 --> 29:07.876
...selling the gallery
and moving on.

29:10.357 --> 29:12.881
Do you think
he'll still propose?

29:16.885 --> 29:19.061
He's got a lot of pride.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.284
I'll write you a check
right now.

29:24.371 --> 29:25.633
I look forward
to working with you, Gabriel.

29:25.720 --> 29:26.982
Absolutely.

29:27.069 --> 29:28.592
Gabriel, can I speak
to you for a moment?

29:28.679 --> 29:31.204
Yeah, of course. Excuse me.

29:31.291 --> 29:33.772
[piano music]

29:35.948 --> 29:37.863
I'd like to invest as well.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.647
And as much as I appreciate
your support

29:39.734 --> 29:41.431
there are other investments

29:41.518 --> 29:43.172
better suited for someone
in your situation.

29:43.259 --> 29:44.695
Municipal bonds,
mutual funds.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.001
I'd be happy to show you
how to set something--

29:46.088 --> 29:48.612
I know how to open
a mutual fund.

29:48.699 --> 29:50.310
I don't appreciate
being patronized.

29:50.397 --> 29:51.877
Oh, no, that wasn't
my intention. I apologize.

29:51.964 --> 29:53.792
My money is just as good
as anyone else's.

29:53.879 --> 29:55.576
It's how the game works,
isn't it?

29:55.663 --> 29:58.405
Opportunity arises in
the private rooms of restaurants

29:58.492 --> 30:00.755
and on exclusive golf courses,
and the rich get richer

30:00.842 --> 30:02.583
and the guys in the middle
are never there.

30:02.670 --> 30:03.932
Well, I'm right here.

30:04.019 --> 30:05.368
I want in.

30:06.935 --> 30:09.808
[piano music]

30:13.899 --> 30:15.465
I need to see
the apartment tomorrow.

30:15.552 --> 30:16.945
There's something
I have to do now.

30:17.032 --> 30:19.078
- With Chuck?
- Serena didn't believe us.

30:19.165 --> 30:20.862
You mean she didn't
just dump her boyfriend

30:20.949 --> 30:22.124
'cause you two told her to?

30:22.211 --> 30:24.692
- What's wrong with her?
- Come with us.

30:24.779 --> 30:26.259
No, I'm not going.
Neither should you.

30:26.346 --> 30:28.435
I mean, it's just Chuck
playing games.

30:28.522 --> 30:29.915
I don't think it is

30:30.002 --> 30:31.351
and if you don't want
to come with us

30:31.438 --> 30:34.354
then please,
just let me go.

30:34.441 --> 30:36.138
I need you to trust me.

30:36.225 --> 30:37.923
The limo's waiting.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.667
You're right.

30:43.754 --> 30:45.539
I need to trust you,
and I do, so..

30:47.671 --> 30:48.977
Go.

30:51.110 --> 30:53.982
[instrumental music]

31:04.819 --> 31:06.952
You should call Eleanor.
We won't be back tonight.

31:07.039 --> 31:09.693
Wait. What? I thought she
was back home in Connecticut.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.957
You thought wrong.
Yes. Hello.

31:12.044 --> 31:13.567
What time are
your visiting hours?

31:13.654 --> 31:15.786
We're coming to see
Georgina Sparks.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.745
Get out your brooms, kids.

31:17.832 --> 31:20.922
We're off to see the wicked
witch of the Upper East Side.

31:33.500 --> 31:34.805
'Visiting hours have started.'

31:36.068 --> 31:37.373
Oh!

31:40.159 --> 31:41.595
Oh. Oh.

31:43.466 --> 31:45.947
I can't believe
I have to see my sworn enemy

31:46.034 --> 31:47.818
with Nancy Pelosi hair.

31:49.559 --> 31:51.735
Now, that you mention it

31:51.822 --> 31:53.868
maybe it's best
if I go in alone.

31:53.955 --> 31:55.783
- What?
- You just said it.

31:55.870 --> 31:58.960
You're enemies.
Why would she help you?

31:59.047 --> 32:00.831
Because I'm gonna threaten
to send her back to boot camp

32:00.919 --> 32:02.355
if she doesn't.

32:02.442 --> 32:04.574
Hmm.

32:04.661 --> 32:08.404
Blair, Georgina and I
go way back.

32:08.491 --> 32:10.667
We have a special bond.

32:10.754 --> 32:11.930
I'll handle this one.

32:14.671 --> 32:16.586
You didn't even
need me here.

32:16.673 --> 32:20.329
You just wanted to get
me alone, away from Nate

32:20.416 --> 32:22.070
away from our first night
in our apartment.

32:24.638 --> 32:26.770
And his motives were pure,
of course.

32:26.857 --> 32:29.338
'I'm sure it's a simple
coincidence that he asked you'

32:29.425 --> 32:31.993
to move in right when
you and I began speaking again.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.691
He asked me so I wouldn't have
to take the subway next year.

32:34.778 --> 32:37.651
That's maybe why he got
the lease on the place.

32:37.738 --> 32:40.436
But asking you to move in
was for my benefit.

32:40.523 --> 32:43.309
Ask him yourself.
Or you could just trust him.

32:43.396 --> 32:44.788
'Still, the fact remains.'

32:44.875 --> 32:47.661
You chose to spend a night
in a car with me

32:47.748 --> 32:51.230
'over a night in your
honeymoon suite with Nate.'

32:51.317 --> 32:54.146
But then again, we all know
your weakness for limos.

32:54.233 --> 32:55.625
I came here
for my best friend.

33:22.739 --> 33:24.132
I think I'm
in the wrong place.

'Blair was so wrong
about you.'

33:40.496 --> 33:41.541
What do you mean?

33:41.628 --> 33:43.543
I didn't want
to make you feel bad

33:43.630 --> 33:48.548
but she and Chuck have this
weird vendetta against you.

33:48.635 --> 33:52.247
Some nonsense about Butter
being closed that night.

33:52.334 --> 33:54.336
That's ridiculous.

33:54.423 --> 33:56.208
If she would have heard
Savannah's terrible

33:56.295 --> 33:57.905
southern accent that night..

33:57.992 --> 34:00.212
She'd have a vendetta
against you instead of me.

34:00.299 --> 34:01.691
[laughing]

34:01.778 --> 34:05.130
So-so, what'd you think
of Georgina anyway?

34:05.217 --> 34:06.783
She didn't make
that much of an impression.

34:09.351 --> 34:11.614
Not even her hair?

34:11.701 --> 34:13.703

34:15.009 --> 34:17.925
I swear her colorist
is masochistic.

34:20.101 --> 34:22.016
I mean, of course
I remember that.

34:22.103 --> 34:23.583
But who cares?

34:23.670 --> 34:24.888
If you'd met
you that night

34:24.975 --> 34:27.065
you'd forget

It's a seven-day session
all about forgiveness

and at the end of it,
we put on a passion play.

It's, um, brilliant.

34:57.573 --> 34:59.662
Oh, it's not that hard.
It's just some flour and paste.

34:59.749 --> 35:01.925
Getting these Jesus freaks
to believe you're one of them

35:02.012 --> 35:03.536

to go back to boot camp?

Still the same old Chuck.

that people can change?

but you..

35:11.718 --> 35:13.154
You're wrong, Chuck.

35:13.241 --> 35:15.025
You know, as-as bad
as boot camp was

35:15.113 --> 35:18.551
it really gave me time to think
about the person I'd become.

35:18.638 --> 35:21.467
Scheming, manipulative.

35:21.554 --> 35:23.556
It sickened me.

35:23.643 --> 35:26.211
So, one day I decided
to do something about it.

35:26.298 --> 35:28.126
I went to church,
found Jesus

35:28.213 --> 35:29.301
and I told him all my sins.

35:29.388 --> 35:31.172
Well, I bet that
was a long talk.

35:32.782 --> 35:34.523
He forgave me.

35:34.610 --> 35:36.177
Look, I know
it seems crazy

35:36.264 --> 35:41.139

you're not here to be reformed.

a man named Gabriel Edwards.

35:50.931 --> 35:52.541
I don't think so. Why?

35:52.628 --> 35:55.588
He claims he met you at Butter
that night you roofied Serena.

35:55.675 --> 35:58.156
Oh. Yeah, I've been praying
overtime for that one.

36:00.941 --> 36:02.986
But that's impossible.

36:03.073 --> 36:05.163
We never went to Butter.

We were back in my hotel by
midnight, watching "The Hills"

on my shoulder.

as soon as we can.'

Okay.

Actually, since my limo's gone,
that might be a while.

And eventually a queen realizes

36:48.075 --> 36:51.383

- We know how I fit in there.
- Well, Dan--

40:20.722 --> 40:22.245
I got accepted into a lot
of other great schools.

40:22.332 --> 40:23.508
A couple-a couple
of great schools.

40:23.595 --> 40:25.248
NYU. They offer financial aid.

40:25.335 --> 40:26.467
I can always live at home.

40:26.554 --> 40:28.513
Or at our new home.

40:28.600 --> 40:30.253
New-new home?

40:30.340 --> 40:32.691
Yeah, we, uh, got
you a little somethin'.

40:33.953 --> 40:35.650
We pooled our savings.

40:37.173 --> 40:39.698
Fortunately, your tastes
are very modest.

40:44.398 --> 40:46.618
This is an amazing gesture.

40:46.705 --> 40:48.402
Well, we want you
to be happy, dad.

40:48.489 --> 40:50.883
And whatever you and Lily
means for us.

40:50.970 --> 40:53.146
I mean, you know,
we'll-we'll figure it out.

40:53.233 --> 40:55.191
You kids are an inspiration.

40:57.150 --> 40:59.239
But I insist on, uh,
writing you a check

40:59.326 --> 41:02.111
'cause there are certain things
a man has to do on his own.

41:02.198 --> 41:03.461
Oh, thank God. Thank God.

41:03.548 --> 41:05.419
Yeah, we were hoping
that you would say that.

41:05.506 --> 41:08.335
The reason I came here was not
to deliver bad news but good.

41:08.422 --> 41:10.424
'And if things work out
the way I hope they will'

41:10.511 --> 41:12.948
Yalewillbe happening.

41:13.035 --> 41:15.560
And a lot of other good
stuff for this family.

[Georgina]
What happened to your limo?

41:20.390 --> 41:21.653
Arthur won't answer
his phone

41:21.740 --> 41:23.306
but I'm guessing
Blair took it.

41:23.393 --> 41:25.700
Blair? You came
here with Blair?

41:29.399 --> 41:31.837
You know what,
it's actually my day off

41:31.924 --> 41:34.143
and I really miss the city.

41:34.230 --> 41:36.929

[Gossip Girl]
Oh, dear queen,
heed the words of a king.

41:49.028 --> 41:51.813
Look like an angel,
talk like an angel

41:51.900 --> 41:53.728
the devil in disguise.

41:53.815 --> 41:56.644
XOXO, Gossip Girl.
