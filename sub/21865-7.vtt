All right, man.

01:14.797 --> 01:17.670
(gasping)

01:17.670 --> 01:20.075
Private break. Go home

(laughs)

How you doing, boy?

<i>you can't sleep?</i>

02:02.626 --> 02:03.896
Ugh, I don't know.

02:03.896 --> 02:05.666
Um, waves,

02:05.666 --> 02:07.036
birds‐‐ is it illegal

02:07.036 --> 02:09.540
to shoot ravens
in‐in Los Angeles?

02:09.540 --> 02:11.144
I'd think you'd be
used to them by now.

02:11.144 --> 02:12.713
You've been
at the beach a while.

02:12.713 --> 02:14.784
Yeah, well, I'm also having
these weird dreams.

02:14.784 --> 02:16.688
Look, if you could just
give me something,

02:16.688 --> 02:17.790
like, maybe prescribe me
something, you know,

02:17.790 --> 02:18.792
that could help me sleep.

02:18.792 --> 02:20.029
What kind of dreams?

02:20.029 --> 02:21.664
Oh, you know, the "yoozh."

02:21.664 --> 02:22.600
(clearing throat):
Uh, you know.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.936
Burt Reynolds and myself,
Loni Anderson,

02:23.936 --> 02:25.039
we're on the set
of <i>Cannonball Run.</i>

02:25.039 --> 02:26.841
I'm Dom DeLuise,

02:26.841 --> 02:28.178
which has always been
a little weird to me.

02:28.178 --> 02:29.647
Why does it not surprise me
that you don't want

02:29.647 --> 02:30.883
to take this seriously?

02:30.883 --> 02:33.188
Hey, Doc, there are few things
in this world

02:33.188 --> 02:35.793
that I take more seriously
than <i>Cannonball Run.</i>

02:36.962 --> 02:40.102
Now, look, I haven't slept
in, like, four days,

02:40.102 --> 02:42.006
and I'm just not in the mood
for dream forensics.

02:42.006 --> 02:43.775
So if you could just
give me something

02:43.775 --> 02:47.984
to knock my ass out,
I would greatly appreciate it.

02:47.984 --> 02:50.022
You also have addiction issues
I have to consider.

02:50.022 --> 02:52.159
You can't just
walk in here

02:52.159 --> 02:54.263
demanding drugs.
That's not how this works.

02:54.263 --> 02:55.232
I can't think straight,

02:55.232 --> 02:57.636
right, a‐a‐and I carry a gun
for a living.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.942
So it's really a public safety
issue we're dealing with.

02:59.942 --> 03:01.845
Your childhood friends
recently came back in your life.

03:01.845 --> 03:03.215
Have you considered
the fact that...

03:03.215 --> 03:05.686
All right.

03:05.686 --> 03:06.821
Sweet dreams.

03:07.857 --> 03:08.892
Not funny.

03:08.892 --> 03:10.696
Well, it's not not funny.

03:10.696 --> 03:11.698
(quietly):
All right.

03:11.698 --> 03:12.867
Riggs.

03:12.867 --> 03:16.976
I will prescribe something
if I think it's appropriate,

03:16.976 --> 03:19.881
when you're ready to talk to me.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.938
Honey, you sleep okay?

03:31.938 --> 03:33.675
No, I did not.

03:33.675 --> 03:36.014
Between Harper's bladder
and your phone

03:36.014 --> 03:37.149
buzzing all night...
(phone chimes)

03:37.149 --> 03:39.787
I may have gotten
four hours.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.824
And it doesn't stop. Not even
at 8:00 in the morning.

03:41.824 --> 03:43.728
Who is texting you?

03:43.728 --> 03:44.964
(typing, phone whooshes)

03:44.964 --> 03:46.834
You've been getting a lot
of late‐night texts,

03:46.834 --> 03:49.040
and‐and if I was an
insecure man, I...
(phone chimes)

03:49.040 --> 03:50.108
(laughs)

03:50.108 --> 03:52.980
What the hell is so funny?

03:52.980 --> 03:55.052
It's a work thing.
It wouldn't translate.

03:55.052 --> 03:56.989
Why? Is it a joke
in another language?

03:56.989 --> 03:58.825
And how
many languages

03:58.825 --> 04:01.864
does your work friend
Scott know anyway?

04:01.864 --> 04:03.602
I am so sorry I kept you up.

04:03.602 --> 04:06.007
But did you just sneak
a look at my phone?

04:06.007 --> 04:07.843
I didn't sneak. I thought
you was in a group chat

04:07.843 --> 04:10.015
with Eddie Murphy
and Steve Harvey's mustache.

04:10.015 --> 04:11.751
Scott is a big part
of the charity dinner

04:11.751 --> 04:13.154
for the Innocence Project.

04:13.154 --> 04:15.058
And if I've been
preoccupied lately,

04:15.058 --> 04:16.661
it's only because I'm trying
to help the men and women

04:16.661 --> 04:18.298
who have spent years
of their life in prison

04:18.298 --> 04:20.269
for crimes they didn't commit.

04:20.269 --> 04:23.108
Tonight is about them.

04:23.108 --> 04:24.910
Tonight?

04:24.910 --> 04:28.151
Oh, I forgot to ask Avery
if I can leave early.

04:28.151 --> 04:29.287
I'm so sorry.
(phone chimes)

04:29.287 --> 04:31.291
(laughs)

04:31.291 --> 04:33.128
No, baby,
it's‐it's...

04:33.128 --> 04:34.730
It's okay, really, really.

04:34.730 --> 04:37.069
I will just see you
when I get home.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.938
(phone chimes)
Mwah.

04:38.938 --> 04:40.075
(Trish laughs)

04:40.075 --> 04:41.811
Oh, my goodness.

04:42.946 --> 04:44.684
Come on, Rog.
(door opens and closes)

04:44.684 --> 04:46.754
(chuckling):
It's okay, man.

04:51.931 --> 04:54.370
She wasn't even
slightly bothered

04:54.370 --> 04:55.305
that I couldn't make it.

04:55.305 --> 04:57.710
She knows I'm suffering.
She could care less.

04:57.710 --> 04:59.080
It's like
the whole thing is just...

04:59.080 --> 05:00.382
It's unbelievable
is what it is.

05:00.382 --> 05:02.786
Exactly.

05:02.786 --> 05:04.890
Oh, I'm sorry, were you‐‐
were you talking to me?

05:04.890 --> 05:07.062
Yeah, s‐since the car there,

05:07.062 --> 05:08.098
about the...
(clears throat)

05:08.098 --> 05:09.200
Morning, Detectives.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.304
You two look... not great.

05:11.304 --> 05:13.141
Didn't sleep.
Didn't sleep.

05:13.141 --> 05:14.710
Oh, you two aren't
sleeping together?

05:14.710 --> 05:17.149
Talk about not‐hot gossip.

05:18.184 --> 05:19.754
Dead body. Talk.

05:21.157 --> 05:22.359
Please meet Mr....

05:22.359 --> 05:24.964
I Died from Blunt Force Trauma
to the Head.

05:31.377 --> 05:33.415
(raven squawking)

05:33.415 --> 05:35.852
MURTAUGH: Okay, so we got
a wetsuit, broken board,

05:35.852 --> 05:36.988
sharp rocks?

05:36.988 --> 05:38.425
Looks like a wipeout.
Why are we here?

05:38.425 --> 05:40.429
Because I literally
just picked his brain,

05:40.429 --> 05:42.833
and found shards
of stainless steel in his skull.

05:42.833 --> 05:44.068
Lividity suggests
he died around midnight,

05:44.068 --> 05:45.839
but I'm gonna have
to confirm.

05:45.839 --> 05:47.843
MURTAUGH: Okay, and we'll
get his body back to RHD

05:47.843 --> 05:49.447
before the birds
have a party with him.

05:49.447 --> 05:50.949
(squawks)

05:50.949 --> 05:53.154
Hey, Riggs, you all right?

05:53.154 --> 05:54.323
Oh, yeah.

05:54.323 --> 05:56.327
Living the dream, buddy.

05:58.030 --> 06:00.034
♪ ♪

06:04.075 --> 06:05.712
Hey.
Hey.

06:05.712 --> 06:07.282
How'd it go at the beach today?

06:07.282 --> 06:09.353
Scorsese's got the body now.

06:09.353 --> 06:11.724
Hopefully, he'll have something
a little more to go on.

06:11.724 --> 06:13.828
Perfect.

06:13.828 --> 06:16.267
Has Trish mentioned
a "Scott" to you?

06:16.267 --> 06:17.402
Some guy she's working with?

06:17.402 --> 06:18.905
No.

06:19.940 --> 06:21.878
You would tell me

06:21.878 --> 06:24.015
if there was something
I needed to know, right?

06:24.015 --> 06:25.084
About what?

06:25.084 --> 06:26.921
Th‐‐ about Scott.

06:26.921 --> 06:29.025
I mean, this guy is texting her
all types of hours

06:29.025 --> 06:30.795
of the night, and...
And what?

06:30.795 --> 06:31.931
(sighs)

06:31.931 --> 06:33.201
She's giggling.

06:34.303 --> 06:36.039
Giggle texts.
(gasps)

06:36.039 --> 06:37.943
(whispers):
Not giggle texts.
Mm‐hmm.

06:37.943 --> 06:39.480
Got more info
on our dead surfer.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.951
Name's Kyle Kennedy, 29,
born and raised

06:41.951 --> 06:43.421
in Del Mar,
San Diego.

06:43.421 --> 06:45.358
Still, he should've known better
than to surf that cove.

06:45.358 --> 06:47.195
The Shore Boys
are a nasty bunch.

06:47.195 --> 06:48.798
The Shore Boys?

06:48.798 --> 06:50.067
A surf gang in that area.

06:50.067 --> 06:51.203
Yeah, they're gnarlier

06:51.203 --> 06:52.472
than your local,
average crew.

06:52.472 --> 06:54.343
Whoa. Surf gang.

06:54.343 --> 06:56.347
Straight outta Malibu.

06:56.347 --> 06:57.449
(laughs)

06:57.449 --> 06:59.353
Shaking in my flip flops.

06:59.353 --> 07:00.822
Actually, it's Palos Verdes.

07:00.822 --> 07:02.426
And these guys
can get seriously violent.

07:02.426 --> 07:04.797
I grew up around there,
surfed every chance I got,

07:04.797 --> 07:06.367
but even I knew there were
breaks to stay away from.

07:06.367 --> 07:07.402
I once got jawed there.

07:07.402 --> 07:08.404
You snake that wave?

07:08.404 --> 07:09.273
(laughs softly)
Brah.

07:09.273 --> 07:10.909
Brah. Brah.
Brah.

07:10.909 --> 07:11.677
Hey, hey, stop it.
What?

07:11.677 --> 07:13.381
It's embarrassing.
You're too old.

07:13.381 --> 07:14.783
I'm not that old.
Brah.

07:14.783 --> 07:15.885
Anyways,

07:15.885 --> 07:17.088
since Bowman is familiar,
maybe a little too familiar

07:17.088 --> 07:20.428
with the lay of the land,
how about we run point on this?

07:20.428 --> 07:22.164
Yes. We'll shred this case.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.203
"Shred" is surf slang.

07:24.203 --> 07:26.106
I‐I know.
Wait, where's Riggs?

07:26.106 --> 07:27.843
I sent him home.
He needs some sleep.

07:27.843 --> 07:28.878
I told him, "Go get a nap."

07:28.878 --> 07:30.215
Minus his baba.

07:30.215 --> 07:31.917
Okay. Is there anything else?

07:31.917 --> 07:33.120
Yeah, there's a neighbor
who lives on the beach

07:33.120 --> 07:35.358
who filed several complaints
against some rowdy surfers,

07:35.358 --> 07:37.996
and a restraining order
against a Cody Lewis.

07:37.996 --> 07:39.466
Okay. You and Bowman go look
into these Shore Boys.

07:39.466 --> 07:41.102
And Riggs and Murtaugh
will talk to the neighbor.

07:41.102 --> 07:42.239
Wait a minute.

07:42.239 --> 07:45.010
The "B" team gets gang duty,

07:45.010 --> 07:47.181
and Riggs and I get the
noise complaint guy?

07:47.181 --> 07:48.251
Dude.

07:48.251 --> 07:49.987
Chillax.

07:49.987 --> 07:52.124
Surf lingo.

07:56.066 --> 07:57.201
TOM:
Hell of a view.

07:57.201 --> 07:58.971
But all it reminds me
of, these days,

07:58.971 --> 08:00.275
is that the beach and ocean
aren't safe anymore.

08:00.275 --> 08:01.944
(yawns)

08:01.944 --> 08:03.981
MURTAUGH:
Because of the Shore Boys gang?

08:03.981 --> 08:05.385
That's right.

08:08.056 --> 08:09.326
Hey, uh, you mind if I, uh...

08:09.326 --> 08:11.229
use your fancy,
little sophisticated, uh,

08:11.229 --> 08:12.365
thingamacoffee?

08:12.365 --> 08:14.202
Yeah, um...

08:14.202 --> 08:15.371
Help yourself.

08:15.371 --> 08:17.509
(sighs)

08:17.509 --> 08:19.513
The Shore Boys are a menace.

08:19.513 --> 08:21.550
I know they like to say that
they're protecting the beach

08:21.550 --> 08:23.488
and their precious waves
for locals,

08:23.488 --> 08:24.523
but all they are...

08:24.523 --> 08:25.959
just a bunch
of alcohol‐

08:25.959 --> 08:27.295
and drug‐abusing
violent thugs...

08:28.498 --> 08:30.134
That's a little complicated.

08:30.134 --> 08:32.973
It's okay. I'm an industry
professional. Thank you.

08:32.973 --> 08:35.110
Anyway, the police come out,
and they just issue warnings.

08:35.110 --> 08:36.480
No one ever gets
arrested. It's a joke.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.551
(coffee machine gurgling)

08:38.551 --> 08:39.520
Who's Cody Lewis?

08:39.520 --> 08:41.357
He's the ringleader. Some people

08:41.357 --> 08:43.193
around here,
my son included, seem to think

08:43.193 --> 08:45.565
that he's God's gift
to the waves

08:45.565 --> 08:48.003
but everything ugly that happens
at the beach or in this town,

08:48.003 --> 08:49.306
I guarantee you,

08:49.306 --> 08:51.009
Cody is
a part of it.

08:51.009 --> 08:53.314
Innocence Project dinner.
You're going to this?

08:53.314 --> 08:55.351
Yeah. $10,000 a ticket

08:55.351 --> 08:57.389
and the food sucks.

08:57.389 --> 08:58.591
But it's for
a great cause.

09:01.297 --> 09:02.566
That's my son, Austin.

09:02.566 --> 09:05.037
Any kids,
Detective?

09:05.037 --> 09:06.941
Three.
(sighs)

09:09.045 --> 09:10.147
Sometimes it feels like four.

09:10.147 --> 09:11.917
(quietly):
What do you want me to do?

09:11.917 --> 09:13.988
What do you want me to do?
It won't stop.

09:13.988 --> 09:14.823
(mouthing)

09:14.823 --> 09:17.061
Hey. Earth to Austin.
What the hell?

09:17.061 --> 09:17.963
These men are detectives.

09:17.963 --> 09:19.065
They're here about
the body that was found

09:19.065 --> 09:21.002
on the beach yesterday.
You know anything about that?

09:21.002 --> 09:23.073
Nope.

09:25.077 --> 09:26.212
TOM:
Sorry,

09:26.212 --> 09:29.252
but my son has taken to spending
most of his time surfing

09:29.252 --> 09:30.321
with Cody Lewis
and the boys.

09:30.321 --> 09:32.057
And as you can see...
(screams)

09:32.057 --> 09:33.159
God!

09:35.598 --> 09:37.167
(sputters)

09:37.167 --> 09:40.040
It's, uh, the, uh...

09:40.040 --> 09:41.443
(laughing):
Oh!

09:41.443 --> 09:42.946
(whoops)

09:42.946 --> 09:45.050
That thing is complicated.

09:45.050 --> 09:46.954
Excuse us, he hasn't
been sleeping.
For sure.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.357
Oh, who needs sleep?
It's overrated.

09:49.960 --> 09:53.066
Uh, can you tell us
where we can find Cody Lewis?

09:53.066 --> 09:55.304
No, but I can show him to you.

09:55.304 --> 09:57.107
A few months ago, I had
these cameras installed

09:57.107 --> 09:58.310
so I could collect
video footage

09:58.310 --> 10:00.080
Stop that.
so I could show the city
so they could start

10:00.080 --> 10:01.350
to enforce a curfew.

10:01.350 --> 10:02.652
I want my beach back.

10:02.652 --> 10:04.221
Yes, right there.
That's Cody right there.

10:04.221 --> 10:07.429
I just wish
the cameras had audio.

10:07.429 --> 10:09.198
I say we hear him
loud and clear.

10:09.198 --> 10:10.100
(laughing):
Loud and clear!

10:10.100 --> 10:12.405
Bad guys! I'm gonna
catch these bad guys.

10:12.405 --> 10:15.210
You think I can get
a cup of that to go?

10:21.423 --> 10:23.159
Murtaugh and Riggs
are on their way.

10:23.159 --> 10:25.030
You sure your boy Cody
will show up?

10:25.030 --> 10:27.334
Uh, no, but this is like
Shore Boys HQ.

10:27.334 --> 10:28.471
With any luck, you know,
he'll show up,

10:28.471 --> 10:29.539
and his buddies will be here.

10:29.539 --> 10:31.443
Bowman.
Hey.

10:31.443 --> 10:34.148
Okay, that's your third
high five since we got here.

10:34.148 --> 10:35.017
What's up?

10:35.017 --> 10:36.587
I'm just a guy people
like to high‐five.

10:36.587 --> 10:38.491
I'm high‐five‐able.

10:38.491 --> 10:39.459
"High‐five‐able."

10:39.459 --> 10:41.295
Yeah, it's my thing.

10:41.295 --> 10:42.732
Top shelf. No charge.

10:42.732 --> 10:44.736
(laughs):
Thanks, but, uh...

10:44.736 --> 10:46.607
we're actually on duty.
(chuckles)

10:46.607 --> 10:47.609
You know him?

10:47.609 --> 10:49.378
Not personally.

10:49.378 --> 10:50.515
Professionally?

10:50.515 --> 10:53.319
He's the guy who punched the
shark. You're Bowman, right?

10:53.319 --> 10:56.192
Wasn't a punch, more of a shove.

10:56.192 --> 10:57.495
You shoved a shark?

10:57.495 --> 10:58.497
Yeah, and he saved five kids

10:58.497 --> 11:00.635
who were surfing nearby.

11:00.635 --> 11:03.173
It was just two kids, and they
were great swimmers, you know.

11:03.173 --> 11:05.545
They saved themselves, really.

11:05.545 --> 11:08.216
We're actually looking
for Cody Lewis.

11:08.216 --> 11:10.387
Uh, late 20s,
long brown hair.

11:10.387 --> 11:12.191
Don't know him.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.575
Punched‐out‐a‐shark guy!

11:24.783 --> 11:26.453
Riggs, that's Cody!

11:26.453 --> 11:29.091
Got him.
(tires screeching)

11:29.091 --> 11:31.630
(siren wailing)

11:36.507 --> 11:38.409
Hey, why are you running?
We got a car.

11:38.409 --> 11:40.681
Hey, Rog.
This is more fun.

11:57.782 --> 12:00.153
(indistinct shouting)

12:00.153 --> 12:01.422
(tires screeching)

12:01.422 --> 12:03.259
(siren whooping)

12:12.311 --> 12:14.415
(siren wailing)

12:21.730 --> 12:23.233
Hey.

12:23.233 --> 12:25.270
What the hell?
Hey, my board.

12:26.472 --> 12:28.476
(indistinct shouting)

12:30.548 --> 12:31.750
Really?

12:46.312 --> 12:47.447
(tires screeching)

12:55.263 --> 12:57.234
(shouting)

13:00.808 --> 13:02.277
(excited chatter)

13:04.749 --> 13:06.853
(raven squawking)

13:08.189 --> 13:09.224
(pistol cocks)

13:10.594 --> 13:12.799
Easy, man. What's the matter,
too much caffeine?

13:12.799 --> 13:14.335
Or you just hate ravens?

13:18.844 --> 13:21.349
The caffeine's starting
to wear off.

13:21.349 --> 13:22.351
Come on.

13:27.461 --> 13:30.200
So you beat the guy up
because he surfed your cove?

13:30.200 --> 13:31.903
That's...

13:31.903 --> 13:35.276
I had words with
some Del Mar kook, yeah.

13:35.276 --> 13:37.949
So, what, he's pressing
charges 'cause he's scared?

13:37.949 --> 13:40.253
(scoffs)
Sounds about right.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.557
An‐And it's your cove?
Is that right?

13:42.557 --> 13:44.662
Look, I grew up in P. V.
surfing that beach.

13:44.662 --> 13:46.298
Now these hedge fund
millionaires

13:46.298 --> 13:47.501
and trust fund
kids show up

13:47.501 --> 13:49.405
and want to take
lessons there?

13:49.405 --> 13:51.342
They're not just
stealing our waves.

13:51.342 --> 13:53.312
All right, you got to understand
this is who we are.

13:53.312 --> 13:54.649
That beach, those waves.

13:54.649 --> 13:57.387
Listen, Cody,
do yourself a favor, all right.

13:57.387 --> 13:58.456
I don't think you're the guy.

13:58.456 --> 14:01.262
But you need to tell me
which one of your Shore Boys

14:01.262 --> 14:03.399
put a blade in this dude's head
so we can move forward.

14:03.399 --> 14:05.638
Blade? What?

14:05.638 --> 14:09.378
Your Del Mar kook, he ended up
dead on the beach last night,

14:09.378 --> 14:11.248
and we've got security footage
of you roughing him up.

14:11.248 --> 14:13.486
See, it just doesn't
look good for you, Cody.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.457
Look, I‐I‐I pushed him, sure,

14:15.457 --> 14:16.993
but I never saw him again.

14:16.993 --> 14:18.029
And wh‐what‐what‐
what footage?

14:18.029 --> 14:20.500
We got security footage
of a house down the beach.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.404
From Tom Noble?

14:22.404 --> 14:24.676
Man, that guy will say
anything to mess with us.

14:24.676 --> 14:26.378
He just blames me
'cause his son wants

14:26.378 --> 14:27.447
nothing to do with him.

14:27.447 --> 14:28.984
So, what, it's my fault

14:28.984 --> 14:30.386
that Noble's kid hates him

14:30.386 --> 14:31.355
'cause he's a lousy father?

14:31.355 --> 14:33.259
No, no, it's not against the law

14:33.259 --> 14:34.127
to be a terrible dad‐‐
if it was,

14:34.127 --> 14:35.396
it'd make my job
a lot more difficult.

14:35.396 --> 14:36.565
So, if you had nothing
to do with this,

14:36.565 --> 14:38.402
then, where were you at
last night?

14:38.402 --> 14:40.306
The cove, surfing,
like always.

14:40.306 --> 14:41.542
I wasn't out long, though.

14:41.542 --> 14:43.479
I took a spill and got cut.

14:43.479 --> 14:45.517
I thought it was the rocks,
but it was actually

14:45.517 --> 14:47.053
Tom Noble's sunken boat.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.456
I needed five stitches.

14:48.456 --> 14:50.293
You can ask the hospital
if you want.

14:50.293 --> 14:52.330
When did Noble's
boat sink?

14:52.330 --> 14:54.301
Don't know, but it couldn't
have been there long.

14:54.301 --> 14:56.305
I'm out every day.
I'd have seen it.

15:03.954 --> 15:05.256
If I knew you guys
were coming,

15:05.256 --> 15:07.327
I would have
cleaned up a little.

15:07.327 --> 15:09.364
Don't worry, we won't
be here long.

15:09.364 --> 15:11.001
Is it possible that
the cause of death

15:11.001 --> 15:12.370
was propeller blade?

15:12.370 --> 15:14.341
Possible.
And can I just say

15:14.341 --> 15:15.310
this guy has an
unusually thick skull,

15:15.310 --> 15:17.047
so it was no small feat

15:17.047 --> 15:20.286
for me to get in his head,
but with a lot of patience and

15:20.286 --> 15:21.990
this pretty sweet
vibrating bone saw.

15:21.990 --> 15:22.992
(bone saw whirrs)

15:22.992 --> 15:24.461
Ooh.
Hey, hey, Scorsese,

15:24.461 --> 15:26.532
just... what did you find?

15:26.532 --> 15:28.569
Okay.

15:28.569 --> 15:30.406
Alloy of aluminum,

15:30.406 --> 15:31.743
and stainless steel,
along with other

15:31.743 --> 15:33.714
corrosion‐resistant
materials,

15:33.714 --> 15:35.316
which are used to operate
in sea water,

15:35.316 --> 15:37.722
so, yeah, your theory
is plausible.

15:37.722 --> 15:39.692
Propellers rotate,
like a turning screw.

15:39.692 --> 15:42.063
This guy definitely
got screwed.

15:42.063 --> 15:44.067
Okay, so you go
check out the boat,

15:44.067 --> 15:46.472
and I'll keep an eye
on Noble at the charity.

15:46.472 --> 15:47.574
Are you going to go spy
on your wife

15:47.574 --> 15:48.576
'cause you think she's cheating?

15:48.576 --> 15:49.578
No.

15:49.578 --> 15:51.615
What?

15:51.615 --> 15:53.419
Trish cheating?
Mm‐mm.

15:53.419 --> 15:55.590
Thank you.
That's right, she's
too classy for that.

15:55.590 --> 15:56.625
She'd just leave you.

15:56.625 --> 15:57.762
Plus, you know, cops' wives,

15:57.762 --> 15:59.631
they never know when
you're gonna just,

15:59.631 --> 16:02.037
like, die on the job, so they
tend to have a backup plan.

16:02.037 --> 16:03.472
Or a backup man.

16:03.472 --> 16:05.309
Hey‐oh!

16:05.309 --> 16:07.313
Not helpful.

16:07.313 --> 16:08.649
Go.

16:08.649 --> 16:11.455
Not helpful.

16:11.455 --> 16:13.459
We can celebrate another time.

16:16.398 --> 16:18.402
(mid‐tempo jazz music playing)

16:19.739 --> 16:22.477
I'm looking for my wife,
Trish Murtaugh.

16:22.477 --> 16:23.479
One moment.

16:23.479 --> 16:26.485
I need a 20 on
Mrs. Murtaugh.

16:29.357 --> 16:33.432
Uh, she's with Scott
in his dressing room, that way.

16:34.601 --> 16:36.605
(indistinct chatter)

16:41.582 --> 16:43.552
LAPD.

16:49.498 --> 16:51.535
What the hell is
going on here?

16:51.535 --> 16:55.143
Roger, what are you...?

16:55.143 --> 16:57.113
(stammering)

16:57.113 --> 17:00.419
Scottie Pippen.

17:00.419 --> 17:02.357
Scott is <i>Scottie?!</i>

17:02.357 --> 17:03.359
(laughs)

17:03.359 --> 17:05.363
Chicago Bulls.
Six rings.

17:05.363 --> 17:07.534
Oh, my God, Scottie Pippen!

17:07.534 --> 17:09.538
Mm‐hmm.
(squeaky voice):
Scottie Pippen!

17:09.538 --> 17:10.773
Scott, this is
my husband, Roger.

17:10.773 --> 17:13.145
Roger, nice to meet you.

17:13.145 --> 17:14.381
Your wife is amazing.

17:14.381 --> 17:15.683
You're amazing.

17:15.683 --> 17:18.756
Scott is our keynote
speaker tonight.

17:18.756 --> 17:21.395
It's Scottie.
Sorry about that.

17:21.395 --> 17:23.732
You know, she don't know
what we know.

17:23.732 --> 17:26.171
I can put up the last shot
in a packed arena,

17:26.171 --> 17:28.642
but giving speeches,
I freeze up.

17:28.642 --> 17:30.680
No, not anymore.
Not tonight.

17:30.680 --> 17:33.552
You... You're gonna
be great, Scott.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.590
No, <i>Scottie.</i>
And she's right.

17:35.590 --> 17:36.592
You know what,

17:36.592 --> 17:39.598
you are Scottie freakin' Pippen!

17:39.598 --> 17:42.604
You follow me, player?
No, not really.

17:42.604 --> 17:45.610
You think Michael Jordan would
have put up all those points

17:45.610 --> 17:46.712
if he didn't have you
by his side?

17:46.712 --> 17:48.449
Yeah, probably.

17:48.449 --> 17:51.455
Okay, but B. J. Armstrong
certainly wouldn't.

17:51.455 --> 17:52.357
True.
Okay.

17:52.357 --> 17:55.898
So now you got to get
into your head, man.

17:55.898 --> 17:57.667
You go out there
and you give it to 'em.

17:57.667 --> 18:00.539
You got this‐‐ intensity,
heart, defense, let's go!

18:01.541 --> 18:02.810
Roger.

18:04.481 --> 18:05.851
My reading glasses
are broke.

18:05.851 --> 18:08.422
(Trish sighs)
How am I gonna
read my speech?

18:08.422 --> 18:09.791
You know what, we will just

18:09.791 --> 18:12.730
make the words bigger
on the card.

18:12.730 --> 18:14.501
I'm sorry, Scott.

18:14.501 --> 18:16.538
And he's got this, right, honey?

18:16.538 --> 18:18.809
It's gonna be... yeah.

20:03.886 --> 20:05.890
Get off the phone.
Okay. I'm sorry, it's...

20:05.890 --> 20:07.860
PIPPEN:
Excuse me for that.

20:07.860 --> 20:10.633
To continue, I just want to say

20:10.633 --> 20:11.635
there is hope.

20:11.635 --> 20:14.741
We are freeing
more innocent people each year,

20:14.741 --> 20:16.611
like the five men and women
sitting here.

20:16.611 --> 20:18.315
(quietly):
Tom Noble,

20:18.315 --> 20:20.753
you are under arrest.
For what? I've
done nothing wrong.

20:22.623 --> 20:23.692
Yeah, like everyone else
in prison.

20:23.692 --> 20:25.863
(gasping, murmuring)

20:25.863 --> 20:28.669
Except these fine people
right here.

20:28.669 --> 20:30.639
I'm sorry about
your incarceration.

20:30.639 --> 20:32.577
How about it
for Scottie Pippen, huh?

20:39.090 --> 20:40.259
Why am I here?

20:40.259 --> 20:42.930
Well, Tom, we found your boat

20:42.930 --> 20:45.803
sunken in front
of your beach house,

20:45.803 --> 20:49.043
filled with 30 kilos
of cocaine.

20:49.043 --> 20:52.683
And a chunk of flesh
on the propeller

20:52.683 --> 20:54.087
matches our victim.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.889
(whispering):
Oh, we don't have
a positive I. D. on that.

20:55.889 --> 20:57.193
Mr. Noble reported

20:57.193 --> 21:00.833
that his boat was stolen
two days ago.

21:00.833 --> 21:01.901
He did?

21:01.901 --> 21:04.006
Here's a copy
of the police report,

21:04.006 --> 21:05.776
which, clearly,
you did not have.

21:05.776 --> 21:07.947
(sighs)
Huh.

21:07.947 --> 21:09.150
So, maybe you should
spend your time

21:09.150 --> 21:10.719
investigating that crime

21:10.719 --> 21:12.223
instead of harassing my client.

21:13.292 --> 21:16.298
Yeah, um, give
us a second.

21:18.735 --> 21:21.041
The drugs was his, right?
Positively, now.

21:21.041 --> 21:23.679
Well, they were positively
on the boat, yes.

21:23.679 --> 21:25.115
His stolen boat?

21:25.115 --> 21:26.885
It's a wrinkle,
Rog, I'm aware.

21:26.885 --> 21:29.824
My apologies
to Mr. Noble.

21:29.824 --> 21:31.194
You're free to go, but
if you plan on leaving town

21:31.194 --> 21:33.298
for any reason,
just please let us know.

21:33.298 --> 21:35.803
Told you, Cody Lewis
and the Shore Boys

21:35.803 --> 21:36.805
are behind all of this.

21:41.081 --> 21:42.316
What is wrong with you two?

21:42.316 --> 21:43.919
That is a rookie move
to bring him in here

21:43.919 --> 21:44.921
without anything else.

21:44.921 --> 21:46.324
His rookie move.

21:46.324 --> 21:48.995
And because of it,
now neither Trish

21:48.995 --> 21:51.101
nor Scottie Pippen
is talking to me.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.403
You know Scottie Pippen?

21:52.403 --> 21:53.939
Yeah.
He thinks Trish is
hooking up with him.

21:53.939 --> 21:54.941
No.

21:54.941 --> 21:56.211
Not‐not anymore.

21:56.211 --> 21:57.747
Oh, Scott is Scottie?

21:57.747 --> 21:59.083
And vice versa.
Yeah, yeah.

21:59.083 --> 22:00.919
And I said if she's
gonna cheat on him,

22:00.919 --> 22:02.857
Scottie Pippen
I'm all right with.

22:02.857 --> 22:05.329
I more than encourage that.
I‐I‐I applaud it.

22:05.329 --> 22:06.865
Have you seen his hands?
His fingers are like that.

22:06.865 --> 22:07.700
He's got huge feet.
Hey, hey.

22:07.700 --> 22:10.939
Hey! It's the wife.
It's not funny.

22:12.008 --> 22:13.311
All right, it's funn...
well, whatever.

22:13.311 --> 22:15.014
I'm gonna go find out
who stole Noble's boat.

22:15.014 --> 22:16.885
Tomorrow. Go home.

22:16.885 --> 22:17.987
Get some sleep.

22:17.987 --> 22:19.357
I've already
missed my window.

22:19.357 --> 22:21.361
Right? I couldn't pass out
if I wanted to at this point.

22:21.361 --> 22:22.396
Want me to knock you out?

22:22.396 --> 22:24.867
I would love
to see you try.

22:24.867 --> 22:26.905

27:37.626 --> 27:40.330
Yeah, me either.

27:42.368 --> 27:44.038
Before I passed out,

27:44.038 --> 27:46.276
I was going
through Noble's record

27:46.276 --> 27:49.115
and I found
a possession charge.

27:49.115 --> 27:50.585
Drugs found in a 2007 Jetta.

27:50.585 --> 27:52.054
2007.

27:52.054 --> 27:55.060
Unpaid speeding ticket.
Driver: Austin Noble.

27:55.060 --> 27:57.632
Kid gets busted.
Dad takes the rap.

27:57.632 --> 28:00.705
Guess not everybody had
a nightmare for a father.

28:02.576 --> 28:05.280
AUSTIN: <i>I was heading out</i>
<i>to the boat, all right?</i>

28:05.280 --> 28:07.351
I saw someone
come out of the water,

28:07.351 --> 28:09.122
one of the cops who came
to talk to my dad.

28:09.122 --> 28:10.390
He took the bricks.

28:10.390 --> 28:12.294
Austin, you're the one
who told me

28:12.294 --> 28:15.100
to use your daddy's boat,
your daddy's cove,

28:15.100 --> 28:16.269
and there's cops
sniffing around?!

28:16.269 --> 28:18.206
Dude, you're the one who ran
over the surfer with the boat,

28:18.206 --> 28:19.676
which is why the cops...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:19.676 --> 28:21.379
I'm gonna stop
you right there

28:21.379 --> 28:23.484
because I'm sensing
a little attitude.

28:23.484 --> 28:25.053
Is that attitude, Austin?

28:25.053 --> 28:26.624
Here's a better question.

28:26.624 --> 28:29.228
How you gonna pay me back
for the coke the cops took?

28:29.228 --> 28:31.332
That's on you.

28:31.332 --> 28:33.538

28:33.538 --> 28:35.073

that kind of money.

28:35.073 --> 28:36.209
But your daddy does.

28:36.209 --> 28:37.679
What you think, Austin?

28:37.679 --> 28:40.250
How much is a son
worth to his father?

28:40.250 --> 28:43.089
Duke, come on. My dad's got
nothing to do with this, man.

Yes, an amphetamine.

29:22.101 --> 29:24.038

the case. Please?

the same nightmare?

29:26.509 --> 29:29.115
Basically,

29:29.115 --> 29:31.754

29:31.754 --> 29:33.223

in this direction.

punched a shark in the mouth.

30:17.846 --> 30:20.885
It was a dolphin.

30:20.885 --> 30:23.591
I'm sorry, what?

30:23.591 --> 30:26.630
I punched a dolphin,
not a shark.

30:26.630 --> 30:28.934
Wait, are you serious?

30:28.934 --> 30:30.337
(laughing):
Because everybody...

30:30.337 --> 30:32.374
Thinks it was
a shark. I know.

30:32.374 --> 30:34.445
It was huge and gray
and it had that

30:34.445 --> 30:36.349
big fin thing.

30:37.886 --> 30:39.623
Mistakes happen, you know.

30:39.623 --> 30:40.490
You see a dorsal fin...

30:40.490 --> 30:42.528
Bailey, I could've
taken out its eye.

30:42.528 --> 30:44.432
What does a dolphin do

30:44.432 --> 30:46.035
without peripheral
vision, huh?

30:46.035 --> 30:47.337
Can you see over there?

30:47.337 --> 30:48.206
Yes, because I
have two eyes.

30:48.206 --> 30:50.444
No, Riggs and Murtaugh
said he drives

30:50.444 --> 30:51.680
a 2007 Jetta, right?

30:51.680 --> 30:53.550
That's him.
He's pulling over.

31:01.365 --> 31:02.468
Get out of the car!

31:02.468 --> 31:04.338
Hands on the wheel!

31:04.338 --> 31:05.474
Out of the car,
hands on your head.

31:06.542 --> 31:08.379
Slow and easy, Austin.

31:08.379 --> 31:10.450
Put your hands up.

31:10.450 --> 31:11.486
Turn around.

31:14.391 --> 31:16.262
Why you driving
Austin's car, Cody?

31:16.262 --> 31:17.264
Where's Austin now?

31:17.264 --> 31:19.268
I don't know, man.
I'm looking for him, too.

31:19.268 --> 31:20.303
We were supposed to
surf this morning,

31:20.303 --> 31:21.272
but I went down to the beach

31:21.272 --> 31:22.909
and his board was just
sitting in the sand

31:22.909 --> 31:24.578
next to his phone
and car keys.

31:24.578 --> 31:26.382
Anybody else
looking for Austin?

31:26.382 --> 31:28.654
Not that I know of.

31:28.654 --> 31:29.956
But what?

31:29.956 --> 31:32.027
Austin's been hanging out

31:32.027 --> 31:33.329
with these other guys lately.

31:33.329 --> 31:35.333
Skinheads.
Pretty hard‐core.

31:35.333 --> 31:37.004
You know anything
about those guys pushing

31:37.004 --> 31:38.339
large quantities
of coke?

31:39.341 --> 31:40.544
BAILEY:
Give us a name.

31:43.984 --> 31:44.920
Duke Rawlings.

31:44.920 --> 31:46.489
That's the leader
of that skinhead gang.

31:46.489 --> 31:48.359
I told Austin
he was bad news,

31:48.359 --> 31:49.428
but he bought from him anyway,

31:49.428 --> 31:52.467
and then he started doing him,
you know, favors.

31:52.467 --> 31:55.574
Favors like using his dad's boat
to move drugs?

31:57.044 --> 31:58.012
Yeah, maybe.

32:01.052 --> 32:03.489
MURTAUGH:
<i>Your son has been associating</i>

32:03.489 --> 32:05.293
with a guy named Duke Rawlings.

32:05.293 --> 32:07.464
He's got connections
to the Aryan Brotherhood.

32:07.464 --> 32:08.633
Aryan Brotherhood? No.

32:08.633 --> 32:10.570
He is messed
up, and he...

32:10.570 --> 32:13.076
he's probably an addict,
but he's no racist.

32:13.076 --> 32:14.478
Where's your son now?

32:14.478 --> 32:16.950
I don't know.

32:16.950 --> 32:18.419
He called before.

32:18.419 --> 32:20.023
He said...

32:20.023 --> 32:21.025
he said he was...

32:22.394 --> 32:23.630
He said what?

32:24.699 --> 32:26.102
Said he'd been kidnapped

32:26.102 --> 32:27.739
and that he
needed money.

32:27.739 --> 32:29.475
I didn't believe him,
so I hung up.

32:29.475 --> 32:30.677
Nice.
Father of the year.

32:30.677 --> 32:32.648
I didn't think it was real.

32:32.648 --> 32:34.451
He's been lying to me for years.

32:34.451 --> 32:35.286
And every penny
I've ever given him

32:35.286 --> 32:36.122
has always gone
right up his nose.

32:36.122 --> 32:37.290
So when do you stop
throwing money

32:37.290 --> 32:40.463
at the problem and then just
throw in the towel? When?

32:40.463 --> 32:41.767
How about never?

32:43.703 --> 32:45.006
He was a great kid.

32:45.006 --> 32:46.609
Growing up, we
used to be close.

32:46.609 --> 32:49.448
And then his mother died
and I don't know...

32:49.448 --> 32:51.018
I just wasn't
good enough.

32:51.018 --> 32:53.089
(Skype rings)

32:53.089 --> 32:54.158
That's him.

32:54.158 --> 32:55.560
It's a Skype request.

32:55.560 --> 32:56.763
Answer it.

32:56.763 --> 32:58.132
But don't let 'em know
that we're here.

32:58.132 --> 33:00.336
(Skype continues ringing)

33:02.474 --> 33:03.443
(exhales)

33:03.443 --> 33:04.411
Dad...

33:04.411 --> 33:09.021
you need to wire them
a million dollars...

33:09.021 --> 33:10.323
or they're gonna kill me.

33:13.029 --> 33:13.997
Dad, please...

33:19.608 --> 33:21.078
Don't hurt him! Please!

33:22.447 --> 33:24.418
Hey, hey, hey...

33:24.418 --> 33:26.757
Dad, please!

33:26.757 --> 33:28.092
(grunts)

33:28.092 --> 33:30.430
(blades snick, Austin screaming)

33:33.804 --> 33:36.408
You have one hour,

33:36.408 --> 33:38.079
or we're gonna take his hand.

33:38.079 --> 33:39.615
AUSTIN:
Dad, please!

33:39.615 --> 33:41.452
Please, Dad!

33:49.568 --> 33:50.603
What's taking so long?

33:50.603 --> 33:53.476
Need the IP address
they sent the Skype from.

33:53.476 --> 33:54.444

33:54.444 --> 33:55.446
Here you go.

33:58.987 --> 33:59.789
Yeah.

33:59.789 --> 34:01.592
All right,
we just took that right.

34:01.592 --> 34:02.627
Okay, thanks, Bailey.

34:02.627 --> 34:04.398
She said it should be
just up here.

34:08.406 --> 34:10.510
Well,

34:10.510 --> 34:11.545
we have
a few choices:

34:11.545 --> 34:16.990
birds, plants or pizza delivery?

34:16.990 --> 34:17.892

He won't be charged
with murder.

Just possession
and intent to distribute.

41:18.899 --> 41:20.869
I'm‐a do it.
No, baby.

41:20.869 --> 41:23.442
You shouldn't.
(stammers, laughs)

41:23.442 --> 41:24.510
What?

41:24.510 --> 41:26.648
He sent me back, like...

41:26.648 --> 41:27.650
four eggplants?

41:27.650 --> 41:29.954
What? Honey, give me this thing.

41:29.954 --> 41:31.357
No, he didn't.

41:31.357 --> 41:32.359
(laughs)

41:32.359 --> 41:34.564
It's a... what does that mean?

41:40.476 --> 41:43.849
Wake up, boy.

42:10.969 --> 42:11.971
That a boy.

42:14.443 --> 42:17.416
You should have done this
a long time ago.

42:23.461 --> 42:25.097
Do it.

42:25.097 --> 42:27.903
Do the thing
you really want to do.

42:29.139 --> 42:32.078
Or don't you have the guts?

42:32.078 --> 42:33.615
Do it!

42:37.155 --> 42:39.159
<i>(gunshot)</i>

42:52.486 --> 42:54.657
(exhales)

42:57.902 --> 42:59.406
Okay.

43:01.777 --> 43:02.879
Maybe we should talk.
