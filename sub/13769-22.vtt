WEBVTT

00:04.087 --> 00:07.048
(baby crying loudly)

00:07.090 --> 00:08.133
(gasps)

00:08.175 --> 00:10.344
Oh, not  again.

00:10.385 --> 00:13.054
This baby... is gonna kill us.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.056
LOIS:

00:13.096 --> 00:15.056
Oh, Jamie, for the love of...!

00:15.098 --> 00:16.642
It's all over the walls.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.560
Boys, it's a level three!

00:18.602 --> 00:19.728
Backyard, now!

00:20.604 --> 00:21.522
(crying)

00:21.563 --> 00:22.982
(gagging):

00:21.563 --> 00:22.982
Oh, my God!

00:23.022 --> 00:24.984
How does this kid

00:23.022 --> 00:24.984
keep getting out

00:23.022 --> 00:24.984
of its diaper?

00:25.024 --> 00:25.985
Damned if I know.

00:26.025 --> 00:27.068
I put that one on

00:26.025 --> 00:27.068
with duct tape.

00:27.110 --> 00:29.070
Reese, get a mask and bucket

00:27.110 --> 00:29.070
and clean up that wall.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.071
Malcolm, find the old diaper

00:30.113 --> 00:31.448
and bury it

00:30.113 --> 00:31.448
at least three feet deep.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.617
Dewey, stand by

00:31.490 --> 00:33.617
with the garden hose.

00:35.911 --> 00:37.872
Oh, we don't

00:35.911 --> 00:37.872
have any diapers!

00:37.913 --> 00:40.081
How did we go through

00:37.913 --> 00:40.081
a bonus pack in one day?

00:40.123 --> 00:42.083
Ugh! Jamie just went

00:40.123 --> 00:42.083
all over the towel!

00:42.125 --> 00:44.545
Dewey, here.... give me

00:42.125 --> 00:44.545
your pajama top.

00:44.586 --> 00:45.754
Not again!

00:45.796 --> 00:48.716
This is my last pair!

00:48.757 --> 00:50.091
Let's get you to the shower.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.385
God... oh...

00:51.426 --> 00:53.804
LOIS:

00:51.426 --> 00:53.804
Oh, no, no, no, wait, wait.

00:53.846 --> 00:56.724
Ugh, it's in my hair!

00:56.765 --> 00:59.810
♪ Life is unfair. ♪

01:04.940 --> 01:07.108
Yes, I was checking our status

01:04.940 --> 01:07.108
at the day care center.

01:07.150 --> 01:11.279
What? How do you move  down

01:07.150 --> 01:11.279
on the waiting list?

01:11.321 --> 01:12.990
Those are juvenile

01:11.321 --> 01:12.990
offenses

01:13.032 --> 01:15.409
and shouldn't be part

01:13.032 --> 01:15.409
of the public record!

01:16.869 --> 01:18.286
Hal, what are we going to do?

01:18.328 --> 01:19.788
My maternity leave is over,

01:19.830 --> 01:21.122
I go back to work tomorrow,

01:21.164 --> 01:23.542
and we still haven't found

01:21.164 --> 01:23.542
day care for Jamie.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.045
Well, honey, maybe

01:23.584 --> 01:26.045
you'll have to just...

01:26.085 --> 01:27.379
stay out

01:26.085 --> 01:27.379
a little longer.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.006
I know money

01:27.421 --> 01:29.006
is tight, but...

01:29.048 --> 01:30.131
we can always

01:30.173 --> 01:32.509
stretch our pennies

01:30.173 --> 01:32.509
a little more.

01:32.551 --> 01:33.427
This is insane.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.596
There is no juice left in there.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.514
You are watering down  water.

01:37.556 --> 01:38.933
All right,

01:37.556 --> 01:38.933
we're desperate!

01:38.974 --> 01:41.142
But there has to be

01:38.974 --> 01:41.142
some decent day care program

01:41.184 --> 01:42.227
we can afford.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.646
Now, where the hell

01:42.269 --> 01:44.646
haven't we looked?

01:48.067 --> 01:49.234
We're joining a church?

01:49.276 --> 01:50.945
We don't know anything

01:49.276 --> 01:50.945
about these people.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.863
They have the best staffed

01:50.986 --> 01:52.863
co-op nursery in town,

01:52.905 --> 01:54.406
and they'll take care

01:52.905 --> 01:54.406
of Jamie for free.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.158
So, as far as these people know,

01:54.448 --> 01:57.158
we've been practicing members

01:57.200 --> 01:59.578
of the Brethren of Calvary

01:57.200 --> 01:59.578
for years, you understand?

01:59.620 --> 02:01.162
Why doesn't Malcolm

01:59.620 --> 02:01.162
have to be here?

02:01.204 --> 02:03.457
Would you rather be

02:01.204 --> 02:03.457
doing his job right now?

02:03.498 --> 02:08.211
Ow, ow, ow! Let go, let go!

02:03.498 --> 02:08.211
(crying)

02:09.254 --> 02:11.172
What if they

02:09.254 --> 02:11.172
ask me to pray?

02:11.214 --> 02:12.674
I don't know

02:11.214 --> 02:12.674
how to pray.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.051
Look, they only

02:12.716 --> 02:14.051
want to meet us.

02:14.093 --> 02:16.177
So for the next half hour,

02:14.093 --> 02:16.177
as far as you're concerned,

02:16.219 --> 02:18.179
God is the greatest

02:16.219 --> 02:18.179
thing in the universe,

02:18.221 --> 02:19.389
and that's that.

02:19.431 --> 02:21.224
Hello, everyone. I'm Pastor Roy.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.184
I understand you

02:21.266 --> 02:23.184
want to transfer

02:23.226 --> 02:26.229
your membership

02:23.226 --> 02:26.229
from the Brethren in Danville?

02:26.271 --> 02:30.191
Yes. We were longtime

02:26.271 --> 02:30.191
members in Danville.

02:30.233 --> 02:32.235
I didn't know we had a church

02:30.233 --> 02:32.235
in Danville.

02:32.277 --> 02:36.197
It's gone now,

02:32.277 --> 02:36.197
bought out by a strip club.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.365
Really?

02:37.407 --> 02:39.242
Well, it's not

02:37.407 --> 02:39.242
all nude.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.870
It's just topless

02:39.284 --> 02:41.870
with tassels, but still...

02:41.912 --> 02:43.204
We just  so  want to continue

02:43.246 --> 02:45.206
to be part

02:43.246 --> 02:45.206
of the Brethren community.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.208
"Community." I love that word.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.044
And our branch is very active.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.421
I'm sure the boys will enjoy

02:49.086 --> 02:51.421
Bible study.

02:51.463 --> 02:54.215
Oh, I'm sure they will.

02:51.463 --> 02:54.215
And of course,

02:54.257 --> 02:56.677
we also have hayrides, retreats,

02:54.257 --> 02:56.677
prayer breakfasts...

02:56.718 --> 02:57.845
Day care?

02:56.718 --> 02:57.845
Day care...

02:57.886 --> 02:59.429
Really? Lois,

02:57.886 --> 02:59.429
did you hear that?

02:59.471 --> 03:01.515
They have day care.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.515
I did not know that.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.725
That kind of service

03:01.556 --> 03:03.725
is why we have always

03:03.767 --> 03:05.435
been so committed

03:03.767 --> 03:05.435
to this church.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.021
That's wonderful.

03:07.062 --> 03:09.230
Have you gone through

03:07.062 --> 03:09.230
the Precepts of the Covenant?

03:09.272 --> 03:11.232
Yes. Of course.

03:11.274 --> 03:14.028
(nervous chuckling)

03:14.069 --> 03:15.236
Love the Precepts.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.906
Number three has gotten me

03:15.278 --> 03:17.906
through some hard times.

03:17.948 --> 03:21.076
But it always comes back

03:17.948 --> 03:21.076
to God, huh?

03:21.118 --> 03:22.870
(laughing)

03:22.911 --> 03:25.164
Yeah, God's pretty neat.

03:25.204 --> 03:28.333
REESE: Yeah, he's totally

03:25.204 --> 03:28.333
my favorite of all them.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.295
I promise I will hire you back

03:32.337 --> 03:34.840
just as soon

03:32.337 --> 03:34.840
as business picks up.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.092
I've never seen it

03:34.882 --> 03:37.092
this slow, Otto.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.928
That makes six employees

03:37.134 --> 03:39.928
laid off in one week.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.764
It is that festival

03:39.970 --> 03:42.764
down at Roswell.

03:42.806 --> 03:45.266
All of the tourists

03:42.806 --> 03:45.266
are going--

03:45.308 --> 03:47.435
to see where

03:45.308 --> 03:47.435
the UFOs landed.

03:47.477 --> 03:48.979
Our people are losing their jobs

03:49.021 --> 03:51.439
'cause a bunch of idiot tourists

03:49.021 --> 03:51.439
think little green men

03:51.481 --> 03:52.941
crashed a spaceship down there?

03:52.983 --> 03:54.693
That's ridiculous.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.693
Ja.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.277
They will see

03:54.735 --> 03:56.277
nothing down there.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.572
The government put

03:56.319 --> 03:58.572
every scrap of evidence

03:58.613 --> 04:02.034
in a secret vault

03:58.613 --> 04:02.034
50 years ago.

04:05.537 --> 04:06.788
Is this the news desk?

04:06.830 --> 04:08.790
Listen, I'm out

04:06.830 --> 04:08.790
at the Grotto Ranch,

04:08.832 --> 04:10.918
and... oh, my God,

04:08.832 --> 04:10.918
there it is again!

04:10.959 --> 04:12.293
There's something weird

04:12.335 --> 04:13.294
happening in the sky!

04:13.336 --> 04:15.296
I see a light

04:13.336 --> 04:15.296
and some kind of craft.

04:15.338 --> 04:16.339
You'd better get out here

04:16.381 --> 04:18.508
right away!

04:18.550 --> 04:22.303
I suppose it could be out here

04:18.550 --> 04:22.303
for another 20 minutes,

04:22.345 --> 04:23.638
but you'd better hurry!

04:27.350 --> 04:29.352
Hi, Donna, we're here.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.395
Oh, hi, Lois.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.773
This must be

04:30.437 --> 04:32.773
your little angel.

04:32.814 --> 04:33.982
(baby wailing)

04:32.814 --> 04:33.982
There, there.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.317
I don't know what got

04:34.024 --> 04:36.317
into Jamie this morning.

04:36.359 --> 04:39.238
This is  so  out

04:36.359 --> 04:39.238
of the ordinary!

04:39.279 --> 04:42.241
There, there, pumpkin.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.241
When'd you get so fussy?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.201
Well, sometimes

04:42.282 --> 04:44.201
even the youngest babies

04:44.243 --> 04:46.120
can sense your anxiety

04:44.243 --> 04:46.120
on the first day.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.704
Yeah, that must be it.

04:47.746 --> 04:50.331
Uh, I expressed

04:47.746 --> 04:50.331
some breast milk.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.332
Oh, my.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.210
I come from a long

04:51.374 --> 04:53.210
line of milkers.

04:53.252 --> 04:54.335
Once these get started,

04:53.252 --> 04:54.335
there's no stopping them.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.336
(baby wailing)

04:55.378 --> 04:58.339
Whoa, this is

04:55.378 --> 04:58.339
so unusual!

04:58.381 --> 04:59.800
At home we forget

04:58.381 --> 04:59.800
we even have a baby.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.802
Bye-bye, sweetheart.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.180
We're going to get along great

05:01.843 --> 05:05.180
here, aren't we, precious?

05:05.222 --> 05:08.767
Now, I know a lot of the mothers

05:05.222 --> 05:08.767
like to hang around for a while

05:08.809 --> 05:11.103
on the first day,

05:08.809 --> 05:11.103
but we think it's...

05:13.438 --> 05:15.774
I'm still waiting for a price...

05:13.438 --> 05:15.774
Here's your change.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.774
Thank you.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.359
MAN:

05:15.816 --> 05:18.359
That's not the right ointment!

05:15.816 --> 05:18.359
What's wrong with you?!

05:18.401 --> 05:19.360
You said you wanted

05:18.401 --> 05:19.360
the do-it-yourself

05:18.401 --> 05:19.360
applicator,

05:19.402 --> 05:21.029
you crazy old man!

05:21.071 --> 05:23.031
You think you're getting

05:21.071 --> 05:23.031
out of helping me with this?!

05:23.073 --> 05:24.449
You're my wife!

05:24.491 --> 05:26.910
Ooh. Ooh!

05:27.911 --> 05:31.248
Has it always been

05:27.911 --> 05:31.248
this quiet here?

05:31.290 --> 05:34.251
And the best part is,

05:31.290 --> 05:34.251
when you play with God,

05:34.293 --> 05:35.794
it's always your turn.

05:37.462 --> 05:40.048
What does the "T" on

05:37.462 --> 05:40.048
the wall stand for?

05:40.090 --> 05:43.760
Uh, we'll talk

05:40.090 --> 05:43.760
about that later.

05:43.802 --> 05:46.013
Hal, I have to meet

05:43.802 --> 05:46.013
a parishioner in my office.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.889
Would you mind

05:46.054 --> 05:47.889
continuing the lesson?

05:47.931 --> 05:49.057
What, me?

05:47.931 --> 05:49.057
Don't worry.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.310
It's just the story

05:49.099 --> 05:51.310
of Daniel and the lions.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.436
I'm sure you know it

05:51.350 --> 05:53.436
in your sleep.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.567
Uh...

05:59.609 --> 06:01.069
Okay, then, class.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.821
(clears throat):

06:01.111 --> 06:02.821
Uh...

06:02.863 --> 06:05.991
this is a story about a man

06:02.863 --> 06:05.991
named Daniel,

06:06.033 --> 06:08.869
and, apparently, some lions,

06:06.033 --> 06:08.869
so...

06:08.910 --> 06:09.870
Um...

06:09.911 --> 06:13.248
"Uh, it-it pleased Darius

06:13.290 --> 06:14.415
"to set over the kingdom

06:14.457 --> 06:16.668
"120 princes,

06:16.710 --> 06:19.713
"which should be

06:16.710 --> 06:19.713
over the whole kingdom,

06:19.754 --> 06:23.008
"and over these three officials,

06:23.050 --> 06:26.636
uh, uh, of whom Daniel

06:23.050 --> 06:26.636
was first..."

06:26.678 --> 06:29.056
When do the

06:26.678 --> 06:29.056
lions show up?

06:29.097 --> 06:30.431
Soon, Dewey.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.059
Please, you just have to be

06:30.473 --> 06:32.059
a little patient.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.145
Ooh! Ooh!

06:39.107 --> 06:44.946
"Uh, uh, and Darius

06:39.107 --> 06:44.946
said to Daniel,

06:44.988 --> 06:48.700
"'Yea, verily, I smote you,

06:48.742 --> 06:50.660
"and I send thee

06:48.742 --> 06:50.660
to be thrown into the den.'

06:50.702 --> 06:52.287
"Where soon,

06:52.329 --> 06:56.457
Daniel was eaten by the lions."

06:56.499 --> 06:59.711
I thought God

06:56.499 --> 06:59.711
saved him.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.338
Oh.

07:01.380 --> 07:04.132
Well, sure.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.466
I was getting

07:04.174 --> 07:05.466
to that.

07:05.508 --> 07:10.471
Uh, as, as it is written...

07:10.513 --> 07:15.769
the lion dith spit him up...

07:15.810 --> 07:18.146
...along with a lamb.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.190
A talking lamb.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.359
(loudly):

07:21.024 --> 07:22.359
"And verily,

07:22.401 --> 07:23.693
"it came to pass

07:23.735 --> 07:27.322
"that the big lump in the middle

07:23.735 --> 07:27.322
of the boa constrictor

07:27.364 --> 07:28.407
"turned out to be

07:28.448 --> 07:30.909
"the missing ranger.

07:30.951 --> 07:34.495
"Forasmuch as the multitudes

07:30.951 --> 07:34.495

Mrs. Pitzer,

08:20.583 --> 08:22.543
the church secretary,

08:22.585 --> 08:24.379
suffered a paralyzing

08:22.585 --> 08:24.379
spider bite

08:24.421 --> 08:26.131

08:38.643 --> 08:40.061

09:08.215 --> 09:09.383
You see this paycheck?

09:09.424 --> 09:11.301
I earned this because

09:09.424 --> 09:11.301
we have day care.

Malcolm, you have to give

09:22.645 --> 09:25.648
this church a chance.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.650
I understand it's

09:25.690 --> 09:27.650
a little different

09:27.692 --> 09:29.027
from what we're

09:27.692 --> 09:29.027
used to,

09:29.069 --> 09:30.987
but I opened up

09:29.069 --> 09:30.987
to the experience,

09:31.029 --> 09:34.199
and I feel a real

09:31.029 --> 09:34.199
spiritual connection.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.909
(hammers pounding)

09:37.160 --> 09:38.619
How's it looking, Hal?

09:37.160 --> 09:38.619
Great.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.372
See you got the

09:38.661 --> 09:40.372
windows framed in.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.834
We all find

09:42.582 --> 09:44.834
our own path...

09:44.876 --> 09:46.711
our own way.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.004
(baby wailing)

09:48.046 --> 09:50.006
I don't like the way

09:48.046 --> 09:50.006
it feels either,

09:50.048 --> 09:52.092
but I don't have any more

09:50.048 --> 09:52.092
blouses, you little miracle.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.634
(crying)

09:53.676 --> 09:56.471
If you could just, for the love

09:53.676 --> 09:56.471
of God, stop crying.

09:56.513 --> 09:57.305
Hi, Donna.

09:57.347 --> 09:58.639
Oh, don't tell me

09:58.681 --> 10:00.683
Jamie's

09:58.681 --> 10:00.683
been carrying on again.

10:00.725 --> 10:03.270
You sure have

10:00.725 --> 10:03.270
a high-spirited little one.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.479
Yeah, I guess I do.

10:04.521 --> 10:05.480
Thanks for everything.

10:05.522 --> 10:06.647
All right, dear.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.316
Oh, and are you going

10:06.689 --> 10:08.316
to be picking up Seth,

10:08.358 --> 10:09.650
or should he be dropped off?

10:09.692 --> 10:10.651
Seth? Who's Seth?

10:10.693 --> 10:12.653
You're babysitting

10:10.693 --> 10:12.653
Seth Richards.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.655
It's been on the schedule

10:12.695 --> 10:14.655
for two weeks.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.451
See? Saturday,

10:14.697 --> 10:17.451
Lois has Seth.

10:17.492 --> 10:19.035
You don't understand.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.246
I'm one of those people who

10:19.077 --> 10:21.246
drops kids  off  at the co-op.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.663
I don't watch them. I work.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.665
We all take turns sitting.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.667
That's what "co-op" means.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.670
But I thought this one of those

10:26.709 --> 10:29.670
churches where, you know,

10:29.712 --> 10:32.048
people felt good doing things

10:29.712 --> 10:32.048
for other people

10:32.090 --> 10:33.925
who don't have

10:32.090 --> 10:33.925
to do anything back.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.344
I have to work tomorrow.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.054
I'm sorry, but you're going

10:38.096 --> 10:40.474
to have to figure out

10:38.096 --> 10:40.474
something else.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.683
Seth, you have got

10:40.515 --> 10:42.683
to get out of there!

10:42.725 --> 10:44.352
This is my fort!

10:44.394 --> 10:46.605
I'll be with you in a minute.

10:46.646 --> 10:47.688
(groans)

10:57.532 --> 10:59.409
I have to admit,

10:57.532 --> 10:59.409
I was a doubter.

10:59.451 --> 11:00.994
But I guess

10:59.451 --> 11:00.994
we're pretty lucky

11:01.035 --> 11:02.870
to get a visit

11:01.035 --> 11:02.870
from an actual UFO.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.331
Yeah, yeah, but look at me.

11:04.372 --> 11:09.710
I am still shaking from seeing

11:04.372 --> 11:09.710
that craft with my own two eyes.

11:09.752 --> 11:13.548
I tell you, they spoke to me

11:09.752 --> 11:13.548
telepathically.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.342
MAN:

11:13.590 --> 11:15.342
There's been

11:13.590 --> 11:15.342
another sighting!

11:15.383 --> 11:17.344
The alien's moved down

11:15.383 --> 11:17.344
to the Songbird Ranch.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.720
They actually have

11:17.385 --> 11:19.720
a piece of landing gear.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.139
(chattering)

11:21.181 --> 11:22.140
What?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.308
No, they don't.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.434
They're lying.

11:24.476 --> 11:25.726
Otto, we can't

11:24.476 --> 11:25.726
let these people...

11:25.768 --> 11:27.395
For your own safety,

11:27.437 --> 11:29.230
do not wave at them.

11:29.272 --> 11:30.731
They think our hands

11:30.773 --> 11:32.359
are sex organs.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.653
You may start something

11:32.400 --> 11:34.653
you won't want to finish.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.161
What?

11:43.203 --> 11:44.745
I love you.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.456
Stop saying that.

11:46.498 --> 11:47.915
Ever since we joined

11:46.498 --> 11:47.915
this church,

11:47.957 --> 11:49.917
you've been acting

11:47.957 --> 11:49.917
really weird.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.752
That's because

11:49.959 --> 11:51.752
I'm a different Reese.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.755
I was sitting

11:51.794 --> 11:54.755
in Bible class dead,

11:54.797 --> 11:58.051
when suddenly I was awakened.

11:58.092 --> 12:00.679
I'm dedicated to something

11:58.092 --> 12:00.679
outside myself now.

12:00.719 --> 12:02.138
Something wonderful.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.973
Now come here.

12:04.015 --> 12:07.768
Can't you just hit me

12:04.015 --> 12:07.768
like you used to?

12:07.810 --> 12:09.896
I'm just too happy.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.774
It's beautiful.

12:13.816 --> 12:15.193
You painted it and everything.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.277
Welcome home, Hal.

12:16.319 --> 12:19.155
I am so overwhelmed by this.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.366
And I'm not just

12:19.197 --> 12:21.366
blowing smoke this time.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.826
You are the best.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.204
God bless you all.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.094
(breathes deeply)

13:12.375 --> 13:15.044
I think you're charging me

13:12.375 --> 13:15.044
for your own soda.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.463
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.214
That kid has me so frazzled.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.049
I mean... Where is he?

13:20.091 --> 13:21.635
Lois, for the love of God,

13:21.676 --> 13:22.843
are you watching

13:21.676 --> 13:22.843
this kid or not?

13:22.885 --> 13:23.844
Where did you find him?

13:23.886 --> 13:24.845
Under a car

13:24.887 --> 13:26.640
sharing his candy bar

13:24.887 --> 13:26.640
with a squirrel.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.767
He didn't like it.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.767
He's sick.

13:28.807 --> 13:29.850
Lois, I am trying out

13:29.892 --> 13:31.852
a less supportive

13:29.892 --> 13:31.852
undergarment.

13:31.894 --> 13:34.773
I can't be chasing this

13:31.894 --> 13:34.773
boy all around the store.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.524
Why don't you just

13:34.855 --> 13:36.524
leave him in your car

13:36.566 --> 13:38.817
like the other

13:36.566 --> 13:38.817
bad mothers do?

13:41.780 --> 13:43.030
Mrs. Munson,

13:43.072 --> 13:45.866
I want you

13:43.072 --> 13:45.866
to release my brother.

13:45.908 --> 13:46.451
What?

13:46.493 --> 13:48.035
Ever since Reese

13:48.077 --> 13:50.789
got in your class,

13:48.077 --> 13:50.789
he's been really nice to me.

13:50.829 --> 13:52.499
Trust me-- it's creepy.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.874
I don't like

13:52.540 --> 13:53.874
this church.

13:53.916 --> 13:57.754
Ever since we came here,

13:53.916 --> 13:57.754
all I do is think about stuff.

13:57.796 --> 13:59.880
What kind of God

13:57.796 --> 13:59.880
makes children think

13:59.922 --> 14:01.882
when they're not even in school?

14:01.924 --> 14:04.135
Well, now, see,

14:01.924 --> 14:04.135
that is a torment,

14:04.177 --> 14:06.887
but I'm sure He has His reasons.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.557
Yeah, like Pastor Roy said.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.351
How God's so much bigger

14:09.599 --> 14:11.351
and wiser than us

14:11.392 --> 14:12.893
and trying to see

14:11.392 --> 14:12.893
what he's thinking

14:12.935 --> 14:15.355
would be like an ant trying

14:12.935 --> 14:15.355
to see what I'm thinking.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.939
Yes, exactly.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.692
But we can trust in His wisdom

14:18.733 --> 14:21.778
and we can have faith

14:18.733 --> 14:21.778
that He is watching over us.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.739
Like me with the anthill

14:21.820 --> 14:24.739
in my backyard.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.116
I spent days watching the ants,

14:24.781 --> 14:27.116
trying to figure out

14:27.158 --> 14:29.410
which ones were good

14:27.158 --> 14:29.410
and which ones were bad.

14:29.452 --> 14:30.578
But they all just

14:30.620 --> 14:32.288
looked like ants,

14:32.330 --> 14:34.081
so I started

14:32.330 --> 14:34.081
smiting all of them.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.208
Well, that's not...

14:35.249 --> 14:36.917
I was smiting them

14:35.249 --> 14:36.917
with the garden hose

14:36.959 --> 14:38.919
and with lighter fluid

14:36.959 --> 14:38.919
and with the lawn mower,

14:38.961 --> 14:40.129
and to be

14:38.961 --> 14:40.129
perfectly honest,

14:40.171 --> 14:42.590
I think I went a little crazy

14:40.171 --> 14:42.590
with the shovel.

14:42.632 --> 14:43.591
Those ants

14:43.633 --> 14:45.301
could have been praying

14:43.633 --> 14:45.301
to me all day,

14:45.343 --> 14:46.720
I wouldn't have heard them.

14:46.761 --> 14:50.181
There was nothing

14:46.761 --> 14:50.181
they could do about it.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.307
But I don't

14:50.223 --> 14:51.307
think...

14:51.349 --> 14:52.933
Really, it's the same with us.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.729
There's nothing we can do

14:52.975 --> 14:55.729
about anything, either.

14:55.770 --> 14:56.937
So why worry about it?

14:56.979 --> 14:59.357
Hey, this

14:56.979 --> 14:59.357
is making me feel better.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.443
Well, that's... good, but...

15:02.485 --> 15:03.862
I guess all we can do

15:02.485 --> 15:03.862
is live our lives

15:03.903 --> 15:04.945
with as much

15:03.903 --> 15:04.945
kindness

15:04.987 --> 15:06.113
and decency as possible

15:06.155 --> 15:08.742
and try not to dwell

15:06.155 --> 15:08.742
on God standing over us

15:08.783 --> 15:09.868
with that giant shovel.

15:09.909 --> 15:10.910
Bye.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.626
That was $50 worth

15:15.998 --> 15:18.626
of makeup.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.754
Am I pretty?

15:18.668 --> 15:20.754
No, you are not pretty.

15:20.795 --> 15:22.422
You have caused me an

15:20.795 --> 15:22.422
enormous amount of trouble

15:22.463 --> 15:23.798
and I have had it,

15:22.463 --> 15:23.798
you hear me?

15:23.840 --> 15:24.424
Seth?

15:24.465 --> 15:26.551
Hi, Mom.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.551
Hi, Dad.

15:26.593 --> 15:27.802
Is he...

15:27.844 --> 15:28.803
Are you from the co-op?

15:28.845 --> 15:30.263
Yes, yes, I am.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.139
And I suppose that

15:30.304 --> 15:32.139
this might look a little odd,

15:32.181 --> 15:33.974
but in my defense,

15:32.181 --> 15:33.974
I didn't realize

15:34.016 --> 15:35.393
I'd have to take care

15:34.016 --> 15:35.393
of a kid today...

15:35.435 --> 15:36.603
a child...

15:35.435 --> 15:36.603
a, um...

15:36.644 --> 15:38.271
a little person.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.898
What are pleasure dots?

15:39.980 --> 15:41.148
Oh, my Lord.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.233
Seth,

15:42.275 --> 15:45.278
you come away from that

15:42.275 --> 15:45.278
woman this instant.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.947
He did some nice coloring.

16:05.757 --> 16:09.677
(grunting nonsensically)

16:09.719 --> 16:11.638
What the hell

16:09.719 --> 16:11.638
are you doing?

16:11.679 --> 16:13.097
What does it look

16:11.679 --> 16:13.097
like I'm doing?

16:13.139 --> 16:14.056
What kind of alien are you?

16:14.098 --> 16:15.182
You don't even glow

16:14.098 --> 16:15.182
in the dark.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.183
Get out of here.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.936
You get out of here.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.061
You get out of here.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.354
You get...

16:29.071 --> 16:32.074
Hal, I had a terrible day

16:29.071 --> 16:32.074
with that child.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.661
Oh, honey, I'm sorry I

16:32.116 --> 16:34.661
couldn't help you out.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.203
I just got back

16:34.702 --> 16:36.203
from an all-day

16:36.245 --> 16:37.622
hayride committee meeting.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.040
Do you know there are six

16:37.664 --> 16:40.040
different kinds of hay

16:40.082 --> 16:41.960
and they all have

16:40.082 --> 16:41.960
their promoters.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.043
Hal, listen to me.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.922
It was impossible

16:43.085 --> 16:45.922
at work with that child,

16:45.964 --> 16:48.048
but I kept thinking,

16:45.964 --> 16:48.048
"I don't have a choice.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.342
I have to do this for Jamie."

16:49.383 --> 16:51.302
And then the parents came

16:49.383 --> 16:51.302
and there was

16:51.344 --> 16:53.053
this ugly thing,

16:51.344 --> 16:53.053
and then

16:53.095 --> 16:54.054
I saw this.

16:54.096 --> 16:58.058
Hey, this is good coloring.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.060
It's baby Moses

16:58.100 --> 17:00.060
in the bullrushes.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.563
And I started to think

17:00.102 --> 17:02.563
about that story,

17:02.605 --> 17:04.064
where the mother has

17:02.605 --> 17:04.064
to take her little one

17:04.106 --> 17:05.900
and send him

17:04.106 --> 17:05.900
down the river forever

17:05.942 --> 17:07.360
to be raised by someone else.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.029
And I wanted to be that mom.

17:11.113 --> 17:16.703
Hal... I don't like this baby.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.078
Are you serious?

17:18.120 --> 17:19.079
I know it's terrible.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.122
I don't deserve

17:19.121 --> 17:20.122
to be a mother.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.082
I'm supposed to be

17:20.164 --> 17:22.082
feeling all this perfect

17:22.124 --> 17:24.460
motherly love,

17:22.124 --> 17:24.460
and it's not there.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.086
It is just not there.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.922
I can't believe

17:26.128 --> 17:27.922
you're saying this.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.590
I know it's horrible.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.926
You really

17:29.632 --> 17:31.926
don't remember, do you?

17:31.968 --> 17:34.094
Remember what?

17:34.136 --> 17:37.097
Honey, you've hated

17:34.136 --> 17:37.097
all our babies.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.307
You couldn't

17:37.139 --> 17:38.307
stand

17:38.349 --> 17:40.685
the sight of any of them

17:38.349 --> 17:40.685
for at least two months.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.102
What?

17:40.727 --> 17:42.102
Well, Reese, six months,

17:42.144 --> 17:44.104
but he was a nipple-biter,

17:42.144 --> 17:44.104
so I didn't blame you.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.147
You told me

17:45.189 --> 17:47.107
to leave Francis

17:45.189 --> 17:47.107
at the county fair

17:47.149 --> 17:49.027
so he could be

17:47.149 --> 17:49.027
raised by cows.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.196
Oh, my God.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.782
It's just that

17:52.238 --> 17:54.782
you're so tired

17:54.824 --> 17:57.744
and, I mean, this all

17:54.824 --> 17:57.744
seems so overwhelming,

17:57.785 --> 18:02.206
but believe me, in a few weeks

17:57.785 --> 18:02.206
you are going to love this baby

18:02.248 --> 18:06.126
as much as anyone

18:02.248 --> 18:06.126
has ever loved a baby.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.420
Really?

18:07.461 --> 18:09.171
Yeah.

18:10.965 --> 18:13.133
Hey, I don't hear anything.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.135
Where is the baby?

18:15.177 --> 18:16.846
Sleeping quietly.

18:16.888 --> 18:18.890
Been that way

18:16.888 --> 18:18.890
for an hour.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.772
Oh, my goodness.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.023
How precious.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.776
Who couldn't love

18:27.065 --> 18:29.776
something like that?

18:31.360 --> 18:34.196
Do we have

18:31.360 --> 18:34.196
to keep the painting?

18:34.238 --> 18:36.156
No.

18:36.198 --> 18:39.911
We just have to find

18:36.198 --> 18:39.911
an atheist handyman.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.375
Come, it's time.

18:46.417 --> 18:48.878
It all became clear to me

18:46.417 --> 18:48.878
that first day in church.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.170
And now that

18:48.920 --> 18:50.170
everything

18:50.212 --> 18:52.006
has been carefully prepared,

18:52.048 --> 18:54.174
this will be the most

18:52.048 --> 18:54.174
magnificent day

18:54.216 --> 18:56.052
of my life.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.177
What are you doing?

18:57.219 --> 18:59.179
I plan to float

18:57.219 --> 18:59.179
above the clouds

18:59.221 --> 19:02.182
and experience the joy

18:59.221 --> 19:02.182
that only birds can know.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.852
You're going to fry yourself

19:02.224 --> 19:04.852
on a high-voltage wire.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.020
I'm not afraid.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.230
I have faith in my vision.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.857
I love you, Dewey.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.198
This is incredible.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.993
I can see the top of Dad's car

19:18.240 --> 19:19.993
from here.

19:20.034 --> 19:22.954
I'll miss you at first.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.207
No, I'm as surprised as you are.

19:27.249 --> 19:31.004
No, I'm as  surprised  as you are.

19:31.045 --> 19:34.423
No, I'm as surprised

19:31.045 --> 19:34.423
as  you  are.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.869
with the level of interest

20:00.366 --> 20:02.869
you've created in this sector.

20:02.910 --> 20:03.870
But what's the harm

20:03.911 --> 20:06.039
in pretending I'm

20:03.911 --> 20:06.039
from another planet?

20:06.080 --> 20:07.247
I mean, all

20:06.080 --> 20:07.247
that UFO stuff

20:07.289 --> 20:09.125
about abductions

20:07.289 --> 20:09.125
and cavity probes,

20:09.167 --> 20:10.459
that's all made up.

20:10.501 --> 20:11.711
Right?

20:14.005 --> 20:16.256
Yes, there are no aliens.

20:16.298 --> 20:19.343
But there are cavity probes.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.723
But you just joined us

20:21.220 --> 20:23.723
two weeks ago.

20:23.764 --> 20:26.559
Believe me, you do not want us

20:23.764 --> 20:26.559
to be part of your church.

20:27.810 --> 20:31.271
We really don't belong

20:27.810 --> 20:31.271
around civilized people.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.107
Oh, come now.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.107
I'm sure that's just a...

20:33.149 --> 20:34.817
(Reese screaming)

20:40.156 --> 20:41.240
(sobbing)

20:45.203 --> 20:47.287
See, that's exactly

20:47.329 --> 20:49.916
the kind of thing

20:47.329 --> 20:49.916
we're talking about.
