00:56.080 --> 00:58.080
I suppose I should
just come quietly?

01:01.160 --> 01:02.920
Ah! Oh.

01:12.960 --> 01:15.280
Aaaah!Oh. Oh.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.200
No!

01:19.240 --> 01:21.440
No, please, no.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.960
You know what he'll do to me.

01:32.880 --> 01:33.880
Ah!

01:38.240 --> 01:40.800
Robin Hood. The
pleasure's all yours.

01:40.840 --> 01:44.200
I think it's time you
were on your way. Now!

01:49.760 --> 01:51.080
Here, allow me.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.200
Here.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.560
So, tell me,

02:03.600 --> 02:07.880
why would two of Squire Thornton's men
pursue you all the way from Shrewsbury?

02:07.920 --> 02:10.759
It wasn't for me. They were
in pursuit of my mistress.

02:12.680 --> 02:17.400
Your mistress? Well, I would hardly
be much of a decoy in my maid's apron.

02:17.440 --> 02:19.880
I was helping her escape.

02:19.920 --> 02:22.640
Escape from what?
-Her marriage.

02:23.712 --> 02:25.712
But the Squire sent men after her.

02:25.752 --> 02:29.112
You know, some might consider
that an act of love, wouldn't they?

02:29.152 --> 02:31.512
Squire Thornton has
never loved my mistress!

02:31.552 --> 02:34.992
If you'll excuse me, my mistress
awaits me in Nottingham.Whoa!

02:35.032 --> 02:38.152
Whoa. All right.

02:38.192 --> 02:44.112
You can't just go to Nottingham alone, it's
too dangerous. I'll take you there...safely.

02:44.152 --> 02:46.112
If you tell me your name.

02:47.672 --> 02:49.232
Isabella.

02:51.072 --> 02:54.712
Will it be necessary for
us to hold hands throughout?

02:56.392 --> 02:57.392
I'm sorry.

03:00.472 --> 03:03.472
In all seriousness, I would
like the use of my other arm.

03:03.512 --> 03:06.552
Shhh!
Come here quick! Quick!

03:06.592 --> 03:08.152
Come here, come here.

03:15.085 --> 03:17.445
We're close, keep moving.

03:31.285 --> 03:32.565
He's back.

04:15.245 --> 04:19.005
Keep together, lads. Move slowly.

04:19.045 --> 04:22.605
Slowly forward.
Tighter! Move smoothly.

04:26.445 --> 04:27.925
Right, come on!

04:27.965 --> 04:31.245
Put some energy into
it! Shields higher!

04:31.285 --> 04:33.045
And now!

04:36.525 --> 04:39.165
Move it closer together.

05:00.325 --> 05:01.365
You're still alive.

05:01.405 --> 05:04.245
Things must have
gone well at court.

05:06.645 --> 05:11.725
Well, they can't have gone that badly, not for
Prince John to provide you with men, horses...

05:11.765 --> 05:13.885
Necessities.

05:13.925 --> 05:16.925
So Prince John sent you back
to Nottingham with a mission,

05:16.965 --> 05:19.365
and yet nobody saw fit to tell me.

05:19.405 --> 05:22.045
The last time I checked,
I was still the Sheriff.

05:22.085 --> 05:24.845
The Prince is still waiting
for his thousand crowns.

05:24.885 --> 05:28.005
His patience wears thin. <
Protect yourself! Come on!

05:28.045 --> 05:30.485
As indeed does mine.
What's the mission?

05:30.525 --> 05:32.085
He wants me to kill Robin Hood.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.725
Oh, I'm sure he does.

05:35.445 --> 05:38.165
But you've... never
managed it before, Gisborne.

05:38.205 --> 05:40.925
Although you did once have
him at your sword point!

05:40.965 --> 05:43.765
Yet still he bested you.
This time will be different.

05:43.805 --> 05:48.445
I will command without incompetent,
ill-conceived interference from others.No.

05:48.485 --> 05:53.045
You will fail, as before, and then you
will be back, and beg me for my patronage.

05:53.085 --> 05:54.285
Not this time.

05:54.325 --> 05:59.005
The Prince has furnished me with a weapon
that not even Hood can escape.What weapon?

05:59.045 --> 06:00.965
I will not have need of you...

06:01.005 --> 06:02.605
ever again.

06:09.085 --> 06:13.845
All I'm saying is, I shot them
- it would be nice if someone else offered to cook them.

06:15.405 --> 06:17.805
Don't look at me. Just
because I'm the girl.

06:17.845 --> 06:20.845
Oh, I think it's established
Much is the girl around here.

06:20.885 --> 06:22.845
Hang on, Allan, what is this about?

06:22.885 --> 06:27.565
I am a man in mind and
body. Yeah? Prove it.Robin!

06:27.605 --> 06:30.525
Turn back, we've got
company. So I see.

06:30.565 --> 06:33.205
No, our old friend is back
from the Prince's court.

06:33.245 --> 06:36.525
What? I thought he was dead!So
what's the reason for her?Robin!

06:36.565 --> 06:37.965
Come on, this way!Go, go!

06:44.245 --> 06:47.885
What are we doing? We can't
outrun them!Don't worry,

06:47.925 --> 06:49.605
we're not going to.

06:49.645 --> 06:51.085
Follow me!

06:52.805 --> 06:54.885
Hold on.

06:54.925 --> 06:57.965
No, we can't!Yes, we can, jump!

07:07.405 --> 07:10.445
Quickly! Come on! Come on!

07:17.885 --> 07:19.685
See you, Gisborne!

07:19.725 --> 07:21.845
It's time.

07:21.885 --> 07:23.965
Get the weapon into position.

07:24.005 --> 07:25.805
Go, go!

07:31.965 --> 07:34.325
Come on. Come on.Oh.

07:42.365 --> 07:43.845
I'll see if the road's clear.

07:50.005 --> 07:51.565
No. They're closing in.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.765
Right, we're making
it too easy for them.

07:53.805 --> 07:57.325
We have to split up.Split up? We
should stick together?Listen to me.

07:57.365 --> 08:01.685
We've got Prince John's Elite Guards
after us. They're taking us seriously.

08:01.725 --> 08:03.525
I'll lead them away. Yeah.What?

08:03.565 --> 08:06.605
I'll be fine. Just go to
Nottingham, I'll meet you there.

08:06.645 --> 08:08.725
Get out of the forest
as quick as you can.

08:08.765 --> 08:12.165
Nottingham? Are you mad?That's
the last place that they'll look.

08:12.205 --> 08:15.805
And Kate, I need you to make
sure Isabella gets there safely.

08:15.845 --> 08:18.405
Kate? Please?

08:18.445 --> 08:20.005
For me.

08:22.125 --> 08:23.805
Good luck.

08:23.845 --> 08:25.685
Robin, wait!Listen, listen.

08:25.725 --> 08:27.085
Kate, Isabella, go north.

08:27.125 --> 08:31.605
Take the cliff road. Allan, Much, go west
through the marshes. Tuck, I'll go east.

08:31.645 --> 08:35.085
Good man, I'll go south.Go, go! 
-Follow me.

08:56.205 --> 08:58.925
The merchants are here,
as per your instructions.

08:58.965 --> 09:01.485
Yes, I can see that.
Let's get on with it.

09:01.525 --> 09:04.565
Thank you for coming
at such short notice.

09:07.125 --> 09:12.125
I thought we'd get the boring business of paying
our taxes out of the way nice and early this month.

09:13.965 --> 09:15.805
Unless, of course,

09:15.845 --> 09:18.405
anybody has a problem with that?

09:20.685 --> 09:22.565
Step forward with
your contribution.

09:31.165 --> 09:34.285
Business is very slow
these days. Very slow.

09:34.325 --> 09:38.685
It must be, hmm? Because you would
not short-change me. Would you?

09:38.725 --> 09:45.165
Because...?If you short-change the Sheriff,
you short-change Prince John.What was that?

09:50.525 --> 09:53.845
You dare to cast aspersions on
my relationship with Prince John?

09:53.885 --> 09:57.325
Because your fate is in my hands.

09:57.365 --> 09:59.405
A word in the right ear,

09:59.445 --> 10:04.645
a whisper in the right
direction. I am still the Sheriff!

10:22.365 --> 10:23.845
Black Elite.

10:28.445 --> 10:29.925
There's more of them.

10:31.845 --> 10:35.565
Why aren't they attacking?
Would you prefer if they did?

10:35.605 --> 10:36.645
Let's go.

10:42.885 --> 10:44.285
Shields!

10:45.125 --> 10:46.645
Together!

10:46.685 --> 10:48.445
Right, lads, shields!

11:01.085 --> 11:03.885
Do you even know how to count?!

11:06.405 --> 11:08.445
Where the hell is my treasurer?

11:08.485 --> 11:11.285
You killed him, sir.

11:13.365 --> 11:16.485
Anybody can see that that
is nowhere near enough!

11:16.525 --> 11:23.645
Years of loyal service, that's worth more
than coins, and dead outlaws, isn't it?

11:23.685 --> 11:27.205
Isn't it?!Yes, sir. It is, sir!

11:27.245 --> 11:29.205
Apparently not.

11:29.245 --> 11:33.925
Very well. I shall pledge
my allegiance in gold.

11:36.845 --> 11:38.605
Come with me, bring that book.

11:40.765 --> 11:43.325
We're going to make money.

11:43.365 --> 11:46.205
It's market day, sir.
It's always congested.

11:46.245 --> 11:48.805
Yes. Yes, you're quite right.

11:48.845 --> 11:50.525
So something needs to be done.

11:50.565 --> 11:53.725
There! You! Two-cow
family, are we?

11:53.765 --> 11:55.645
Yes, sir.That'll be two crowns.

11:55.685 --> 11:58.605
Don't just stand there, man.
Take the money.Two crowns.

11:58.645 --> 12:00.765
Stop! How many goats
have you got there?

12:18.405 --> 12:19.605
Ah!

12:26.845 --> 12:28.445
Anyone hurt?

12:32.085 --> 12:33.125
No.

12:37.125 --> 12:39.565
But you are.

12:49.605 --> 12:51.565
Does that hurt?

12:51.605 --> 12:53.085
Yes.

13:00.365 --> 13:02.485
I thought you were being attacked.

13:02.525 --> 13:06.445
No, I was training my men.

13:06.485 --> 13:10.885
Although watching you and
Gizmo, maybe I'm out of a job.

13:10.925 --> 13:14.805
Oh, I'm sorry...Don't worry.
You've got Titus training hard.

13:17.125 --> 13:18.365
Bertha of Bath.

13:20.285 --> 13:23.965
Of Bertha's Circus Maximus? Famous
from Huddersfield to Haltemprice?

13:26.565 --> 13:29.405
Where've you been?Here mainly.

13:32.125 --> 13:35.565
I gotta go.Why? That's
Prince John's men.

13:35.605 --> 13:37.725
They're looking for me.

13:37.765 --> 13:39.805
Please. I'm an outlaw.

13:39.845 --> 13:42.205
One of Robin Hood's men.
If they capture me...

13:42.245 --> 13:45.925
Which is exactly what they will
do, if you run. Here. Trust me.

13:45.965 --> 13:47.525
I don't...

13:51.765 --> 13:54.245
This is not going to
work... Keep your head down.

14:02.045 --> 14:03.685
How can I help you, officer?

14:03.725 --> 14:06.365
Name, and purpose in this forest?

14:06.405 --> 14:08.325
I see. Straight to business, is it?

14:08.365 --> 14:10.245
Suit yourself.

14:10.285 --> 14:13.005
I'm Bertha, of
Bertha's Circus Maximus.

14:13.045 --> 14:17.525
These are my gladiators, my little band of
helpers, and we're on our way to Nottingham.

14:26.685 --> 14:28.325
What's wrong with him?

14:29.965 --> 14:32.885
He's a leper. 

14:35.965 --> 14:39.205
Be gone, woman. The forest is
no place for you to be today.

14:39.245 --> 14:43.205
I was getting that impression
already, but thank you for the advice.

14:47.005 --> 14:48.525
Let's get out of here.

14:59.205 --> 15:00.205
All right.

15:01.685 --> 15:02.965
Damn.

15:03.005 --> 15:05.085
This is going to
slow him down a bit.

15:05.125 --> 15:06.645
This is all we need. 

15:09.205 --> 15:10.885
This could take a while.

15:10.925 --> 15:12.445
Keep an eye out for company.

15:19.965 --> 15:22.405
What?Are you a giant?

15:22.445 --> 15:24.845
No. Are you a gladiator? Grrr!

15:30.045 --> 15:31.805
Are they all yours?

15:31.845 --> 15:33.085
Er...not by birth!

15:34.525 --> 15:35.965
She saved us.

15:36.005 --> 15:38.005
Eh, Walt, don't be silly.
-She did.

15:38.045 --> 15:40.165
None of us had anyone.

15:40.205 --> 15:42.565
We'd have starved to death.Hey!

15:42.605 --> 15:45.165
That's enough.

15:45.205 --> 15:47.125
I find them on my travels.

15:47.165 --> 15:48.725
Begging or thieving.

15:48.765 --> 15:53.365
I take in as many as I can. I feed them, I clothe
them. I'm only doing what anyone else would.

15:53.405 --> 15:55.165
I wish that was true.

15:57.005 --> 15:59.925
Hey, you could help us.How?

15:59.965 --> 16:02.205
When we get to
Nottingham, fight for us.

16:02.245 --> 16:04.725
Yeah? In the show. ALL: Yeah!

16:04.765 --> 16:08.645
That wouldn't be helping you. That
would just put all of you in more danger.

16:08.685 --> 16:12.125
We'd disguise you again. It was
you that put Gizmo out of action.

16:12.165 --> 16:14.125
No, I can't.

16:14.165 --> 16:16.285
I can't cancel the show.

16:16.325 --> 16:20.005
Or if I do, it'll be a
long, cold winter for us all.

16:21.725 --> 16:23.405
All right, I'll stay with you...

16:24.685 --> 16:27.085
..until my friends
make it to Nottingham.

16:29.005 --> 16:31.925
If my friends make
it to Nottingham.

16:35.765 --> 16:37.605
Oh!Oh. 

16:37.645 --> 16:39.765
I thought you were
heading west? We were.

16:39.805 --> 16:44.085
You're meant to be heading north! We're
trying! There's Black Elite at every turn!

16:46.485 --> 16:48.805
There must be hundreds of men.

16:48.845 --> 16:51.925
There are, and they seem to
know exactly where we're going.

16:53.885 --> 16:56.525
Or where they want us to go.

16:56.565 --> 16:59.245
We've been herded.Like sheep.

16:59.285 --> 17:02.525
Like lambs...to the slaughter.
They've been tracking us.

17:02.565 --> 17:05.405
They've exhausted our
arsenals. I've one arrow left.

17:05.444 --> 17:06.805
So how do we get out of here?

17:08.565 --> 17:11.165
There's only one way left to go.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.685
Come on, quickly.

17:18.765 --> 17:21.685
It's Gisborne. This way, this way.

17:21.724 --> 17:22.724
Where now?

17:24.285 --> 17:25.605
Come on!Where now?

17:25.645 --> 17:28.204
Follow me!Go, go, go, go!

17:43.885 --> 17:45.965
Looking well, Gisborne.

17:46.005 --> 17:47.485
For a dead man.

17:49.085 --> 17:53.085
Be assured that your
death will be real...

17:53.125 --> 17:55.085
not rumoured.

17:55.125 --> 17:59.765
You must have made quite an impression on
Prince John. A better impression than you have.

18:06.765 --> 18:09.085
What's he got in there?
How should I know?

18:09.125 --> 18:10.645
Just ready yourself.

18:10.685 --> 18:15.405
How can I ready myself when I don't know what I
have to be ready for? - Just be ready for anything!

18:32.765 --> 18:35.365
What the hell...? Are
you ready for that?

18:35.405 --> 18:38.965
It's an apt way to despatch virulent
supporters of the Coeur de Lion.

18:39.005 --> 18:42.965
He hasn't been fed for days. I
wanted him to be ready for you!

19:00.005 --> 19:02.365
Just stay together.Robin?

19:02.405 --> 19:04.485
Are you as good a shot
as they say you are?

19:04.525 --> 19:06.085
Of course I am.

19:07.325 --> 19:09.325
Calm down!

19:09.365 --> 19:12.365
They can smell fear, you know!
Really(?)What you thinking?

19:12.405 --> 19:16.485
Throw this as far away from us as
you can. Robin, you hit it in the air.

19:16.525 --> 19:22.045
Yeah. Tuck, can you take the other? Yeah.Everyone,
cover your eyes. Don't breathe this in.

19:22.085 --> 19:25.285
On three. Ready? One...

19:25.325 --> 19:27.485
two...

19:27.525 --> 19:29.085
three!

19:39.285 --> 19:41.085
Get it back in the damn box.

19:41.125 --> 19:43.245
Go, go! Run!

19:47.165 --> 19:49.485
You men, with me.

19:51.005 --> 19:53.325
Mustard powder! COUGHING

19:54.565 --> 19:56.125
Nice work.

20:06.925 --> 20:09.045
Wait, wait, wait!

20:09.085 --> 20:11.645
And where exactly does a
maid find mustard bombs?

20:11.685 --> 20:13.725
Does it really matter?
I think it does.

20:13.765 --> 20:16.965
I believe the words you are
looking for are "thank you".

20:17.005 --> 20:19.325
It won't take long for
Gisborne to regroup.

20:19.365 --> 20:22.445
You need to go to the camp
and rearm. Tuck, with me. -Yeah.

20:22.485 --> 20:24.645
Where are you going?
-To Gisborne's camp.

20:24.685 --> 20:28.365
To see what else he's got, to see
if, and where, he's vulnerable.

20:28.405 --> 20:32.845
Hang on, where's John? Why didn't he
get rounded up with the rest of us?

20:36.085 --> 20:39.845
There's two possibilities. One, he
might have made it to Nottingham...

20:39.885 --> 20:41.645
I don't want to know the other one.

20:41.685 --> 20:43.445
Just rearm.I should come with you.

20:43.485 --> 20:45.725
I think that would be
a good idea. I agree.

20:45.765 --> 20:50.965
The camp should be on a need-to-know basis. And
you don't need to know. With the greatest respect.

20:51.005 --> 20:52.005
Settled.

20:56.405 --> 21:02.445
Bertha's Circus Maximus! Ladies
and gentlemen, it's your lucky day!

21:02.485 --> 21:06.965
Bertha's Circus Maximus is in town!

21:07.005 --> 21:10.285
Place your bets here to
add some extra excitement.

21:12.245 --> 21:13.245
Whoa.

21:16.405 --> 21:18.925
The ladies love him.

21:18.965 --> 21:20.645
Get going, show me your money!

21:23.565 --> 21:25.285
Bring her to see me.

21:31.725 --> 21:36.605
No need for that, Bertha. I don't
expect it from old acquaintances.

21:36.645 --> 21:37.885
Vasey?

21:37.925 --> 21:43.165
Sheriff...Vasey. Let's not
dispense with all formalities.

21:43.205 --> 21:46.165
Now, the last time
we spoke, I told you

21:46.205 --> 21:49.765
that if I ever saw you in Nottingham
again, I would kill you, but...

21:49.805 --> 21:52.605
here you are.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.445
In my defence, I heard
you were no longer sheriff.

21:55.485 --> 21:58.165
Why shouldn't I be?
Who told you that?

21:58.205 --> 22:01.245
I was told you'd moved
on to better things.

22:01.285 --> 22:03.605
Unfortunately for
you, it was a lie.

22:09.005 --> 22:13.045
Not so fast. I assume you are here to
alleviate the locals of their purses?

22:13.085 --> 22:15.725
I go where the audiences are.No.

22:15.765 --> 22:19.525
You go where men are
prepared to gamble...

22:19.565 --> 22:21.165
on your fixed fights.

22:21.205 --> 22:23.965
Fixed? My fights are for real.

22:24.005 --> 22:25.205
HE CHUCKLES

22:26.245 --> 22:30.005
Let's not insult
each other, Bertha.

22:31.085 --> 22:33.005
Oh, how much do you want?

22:33.045 --> 22:35.885
Two hundred crowns.

22:35.925 --> 22:37.805
Anything else you
make you can keep.

22:37.845 --> 22:40.685
I can't make that in a day!
There won't be anything over!

22:40.725 --> 22:45.725
That's your problem. I can give you
half.Then I shall only half hang you.Wait.

22:51.485 --> 22:53.405
I could settle the debt with...

22:53.445 --> 22:55.445
something better than money.

22:58.205 --> 23:00.205
There's no such thing.

23:01.765 --> 23:03.605
What about one of Hood's outlaws?

23:06.045 --> 23:12.885
What if I told you I could have him killed in
your market square for all to see this afternoon?

23:16.885 --> 23:20.165
You can really do this?Would it
be worth a hundred crowns to you?

23:21.725 --> 23:23.245
Yes.

23:25.445 --> 23:27.085
Who's got the rope?

23:27.125 --> 23:29.045
It has to go over there.

23:29.085 --> 23:31.565
Right, ready?

23:31.605 --> 23:33.005
Heave!

23:42.005 --> 23:46.685
Walt, are you hurt?
You saved my life.

23:47.765 --> 23:51.645
What? Oh. I saved
you from a sore head.

23:51.685 --> 23:54.325
No, I was nearly dead.

23:55.325 --> 23:57.045
Very well.

23:57.085 --> 23:59.485
Children?

23:59.525 --> 24:03.805
Now I have to save
your life, in return.

24:03.845 --> 24:05.965
No, no, there's no need.

24:06.005 --> 24:07.925
No! I have to!

24:10.365 --> 24:13.165
All right.

24:15.925 --> 24:16.925
What did I miss?

24:16.965 --> 24:21.165
Oh! We are rigging tonight's fight.

24:21.205 --> 24:27.285
So I want you to take as many bets
as you can on our new gladiator.

24:27.325 --> 24:31.525
Aw, does that mean he's going to be the
loser? Why don't you say that a bit louder?

24:31.565 --> 24:34.405
Does he have to? For
heaven's sake, Walt!

24:34.445 --> 24:36.245
He can win next time.

24:36.285 --> 24:38.965
Right, off you go. And make
sure you give good odds.

24:39.005 --> 24:40.485
Go, go, go!It has to go there!

24:40.525 --> 24:42.485
Hey!

24:42.525 --> 24:45.245
Place your bets
here! Place your bets!

24:45.285 --> 24:46.645
Be a winner!

24:49.725 --> 24:53.405
We've had a special
request for tonight's fight.

24:53.445 --> 24:58.485
Our new attraction
appears for one night only.

24:58.525 --> 25:01.285
At the end of the fight,
I want you to kill him.No!

25:01.325 --> 25:05.285
Do you know what they do to little
pigs with big ears? You're hurting me!

25:05.325 --> 25:07.685
They take them to market!

25:13.725 --> 25:15.125
Why is Gisborne after you?

25:17.005 --> 25:18.005
Cos I'm an outlaw.

25:18.045 --> 25:19.405
It's a long story.

25:24.365 --> 25:26.485
Looks like he's been
here a while. Yeah.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.605
And he could be here a lot longer.

25:28.645 --> 25:30.125
He's picked a good position.

25:30.165 --> 25:33.445
Only one way out. Easy to defend.

25:33.485 --> 25:37.725
There's no-one defending it
now, I mean... Where's Gisborne?

25:37.765 --> 25:39.965
Where I've been all along.

25:40.005 --> 25:41.485
One step ahead.

25:58.125 --> 25:59.125
Guy! Non!

26:03.725 --> 26:05.525
Mon frere doux!

26:07.925 --> 26:08.925
Isabella?

26:10.365 --> 26:11.805
Ah!

26:15.085 --> 26:16.085
He's my brother.

26:19.485 --> 26:20.565
Get after them!

26:20.605 --> 26:21.605
No.

26:25.005 --> 26:28.645
I had him!Guy, tell me. At the point
of my sword! I had him! CLATTERING

26:30.645 --> 26:32.045
Why are you here, Isabella?

26:32.085 --> 26:35.525
I could not endure another day.
So, what? You just walked away?

26:35.565 --> 26:37.325
You were joined in holy matrimony!

26:37.365 --> 26:39.245
I was only a
13-year-old girl!

26:39.285 --> 26:43.685
If you had any idea of what he has
done to me... Guy, I'm your sister.

26:43.725 --> 26:45.245
All I ask for is protection.

26:45.285 --> 26:48.445
Well, it seems you've already
received that from Robin Hood.

26:48.485 --> 26:50.605
I knew nothing of his true nature.

26:50.645 --> 26:53.605
I was in need of help. The
help I'm asking from you now.

26:53.645 --> 26:56.765
Really? And what if I were to
send you back to your husband?

26:56.805 --> 27:00.245
Then you'd be condemning me to a
life of misery for a second time.

27:00.285 --> 27:02.605
Only this time, you'd
be doing it knowingly.

27:03.605 --> 27:08.765
Guy, I don't believe you knew the damage you
were doing when you sent me to Squire Thornton.

27:08.805 --> 27:14.285
But now you do. Surely you must feel some
obligation towards me? A sense of loyalty, duty?

27:14.325 --> 27:19.685
Loyalty? How can you speak of loyalty, when
you have twice aided and abetted Robin Hood?

27:19.725 --> 27:22.805
A mistake, and one I
will not make again.

27:22.845 --> 27:27.005
Give me a chance, and I will earn
back your trust and your respect.

27:27.045 --> 27:28.565
But please...

27:28.605 --> 27:30.885
do not send me back to my husband.

27:37.245 --> 27:40.325
Very well. You may stay.

27:42.125 --> 27:43.685
Thank you.

27:43.725 --> 27:47.845
But if I find you in
Hood's company again,

27:47.885 --> 27:50.405
I will drag you back
to Shrewsbury myself.

27:51.525 --> 27:53.005
You have my word.

27:58.685 --> 28:01.685
I knew! I knew there was
something off about her.

28:01.725 --> 28:03.845
Just concentrate on
the plan, all right?

28:03.885 --> 28:05.285
I mean, Gisborne's sister?

28:05.325 --> 28:08.725
I can't believe you fell
for it. Kate, the plan.

28:08.765 --> 28:11.205
Well, I'm not happy about
it. When are you ever?

28:11.245 --> 28:15.165
Robin cannot just walk
into Gisborne's camp, alone,

28:15.205 --> 28:18.605
with no means of defence, against
Black Elite, and a massive cat!

28:18.645 --> 28:20.445
If we storm in
there, we'll be shot.

28:20.485 --> 28:25.285
Robin looks like he's surrendering. Not one
of your better plans. If we waited...For what?

28:25.325 --> 28:29.045
Isabella to divulge everything
she knows about us?She wouldn't.

28:31.045 --> 28:33.485
All right? I know she wouldn't.

28:34.565 --> 28:36.885
It's a good plan.

28:36.925 --> 28:38.765
Robin won't be undefended for long.

28:40.325 --> 28:41.845
Allan, let's go.

28:41.885 --> 28:47.205
He may look small, but he's strong, and
he's very smart. Sounds like trouble to me.

28:47.245 --> 28:50.765
Not too smart, no need to worry
about an impertinent tongue.

28:50.805 --> 28:54.325
Though you could always have it
cut out.I'll give you ten crowns.

28:54.365 --> 28:57.445
No, I'm thinking 20 crowns.

28:58.565 --> 29:00.485
Not likely.15.

29:00.525 --> 29:04.565
Huh.13. Final offer.

29:04.605 --> 29:06.285
All right. Deal.

29:06.325 --> 29:10.565
Please don't sell me. I won't say
anything to him. I'll keep quiet.

29:10.605 --> 29:12.485
I wish I could believe that.

29:19.565 --> 29:20.805
Is that all you got?

29:23.285 --> 29:24.965
Nearly show time, lads.

29:25.005 --> 29:29.565
And...we've got the
Sheriff watching.

29:29.605 --> 29:35.405
So, let's make sure we give
him what he wants.What's that?

29:35.445 --> 29:37.925
A fight to the near death.

29:37.965 --> 29:40.725
Blood, guts... I
don't want to hurt him.

29:42.205 --> 29:44.885
Don't worry, you won't.
You'll be losing this bout.

29:44.925 --> 29:46.885
What? Why?

29:46.925 --> 29:50.565
Why do you think? The Sheriff.

29:50.605 --> 29:53.565
He wants it rigged so he can
clean up on the bets we take.

29:53.605 --> 29:56.685
And if we don't make
enough, he will hang us all.

29:56.725 --> 29:59.205
All you gotta do is
watch out for my signal.

29:59.245 --> 30:02.045
When you see that, you go
down, and you stay down.

30:02.085 --> 30:06.125
Stay down.You do that, and
the Sheriff gets what he wants.

30:06.165 --> 30:09.965
If you don't, we won't
get out of here alive.

30:11.005 --> 30:13.485
Well, you're not giving
me much choice, are you?

30:22.565 --> 30:24.125
Robin?

30:31.205 --> 30:34.245
Welcome.I like what you've
done with the place, Gisborne.

30:34.285 --> 30:36.605
I wasn't expecting
your visit. ROBIN LAUGHS

30:36.645 --> 30:39.205
Well, I find that
very hard to believe.

30:41.045 --> 30:42.765
Given him a full report, have you?

30:42.805 --> 30:44.685
No conversation with my sister.

30:44.725 --> 30:47.965
She knows where her loyalties
lie. I'm sure she does.

30:50.765 --> 30:54.245
So...would you like
to hear my demands?

30:54.285 --> 30:56.605
Demands?

30:56.645 --> 30:59.325
Please, demand away.

30:59.365 --> 31:01.045
It's quite simple, really.

31:01.085 --> 31:02.845
Get out of my forest.

31:04.205 --> 31:06.845
Yeah, that's a reasonable request.

31:06.885 --> 31:08.525
Let me think...

31:08.565 --> 31:10.005
Kill him.

31:11.205 --> 31:12.605
Now!

31:19.725 --> 31:20.885
Guards!

31:30.805 --> 31:32.645
Hood!

31:32.685 --> 31:36.885
Let's see how many of your men
he can stomach! Eh, Gisborne?

31:39.245 --> 31:41.885
Come on, let's find John!

31:44.125 --> 31:46.805
Gather round, it's
almost show-time!

31:46.845 --> 31:50.605
Is that all you've got? Come
on, place your bets here.

31:50.645 --> 31:53.045
Put your hands together for

31:53.085 --> 31:55.765
Bertha of Bath!

32:10.485 --> 32:12.605
Ladies!

32:12.645 --> 32:16.205
Gentlemen! Honoured guests!

32:16.245 --> 32:20.365
Tonight, you are
truly in for a treat.

32:20.405 --> 32:27.725
You may have thought the ancient art
of the gladiator was gone, but no!

32:27.765 --> 32:30.005
Tonight...

32:30.045 --> 32:35.085
you are in for a dazzling
display of their swordplay.

32:35.125 --> 32:37.125
Welcome our gladiators warmly!

32:42.965 --> 32:46.525
Tonight, they fight
for nothing but pride,

32:46.565 --> 32:48.965
and your applause only. 

32:54.685 --> 32:55.685
So...

32:55.725 --> 32:58.565
without further ado...

32:58.605 --> 33:02.325
Gladiators ready?

33:05.565 --> 33:06.565
Fight!

33:26.525 --> 33:29.885
Let me go!Behave yourself!
I don't want to come, please!

33:32.485 --> 33:35.485
You belong to me now, so shut up!

33:35.525 --> 33:36.525
Ow!

33:38.365 --> 33:41.525
That's it. Don't go down just yet.

33:45.885 --> 33:49.525
Guy, what about your men? You can't
just leave them.They've failed me.

33:49.565 --> 33:53.765
Is that why you gave me to Squire
Thornton? Did I fail you too?

33:53.805 --> 33:57.605
Why won't you answer me? Don't you owe
me that at least? I owe you nothing.

33:57.645 --> 33:59.245
I did what was best.For who?

33:59.285 --> 34:03.005
You? You did nothing but condemn me
to hell, and I demand to know why.

34:03.045 --> 34:06.965
Foolish girl, you don't understand
the world. No, I understand perfectly.

34:07.005 --> 34:09.405
I just want to hear it from you.

34:09.445 --> 34:11.485
Why did you give me away?

34:12.844 --> 34:14.364
I said, why did you give me...?

34:14.405 --> 34:16.485
Because he offered
a fair price for you!

34:19.885 --> 34:21.085
So...

34:21.125 --> 34:23.364
do you still require my protection?

34:26.205 --> 34:27.284
You know I do.

34:51.405 --> 34:55.364
No, you fool, you're
supposed to be the loser!

34:59.685 --> 35:00.805
Let me through!

35:08.045 --> 35:09.205
Let me past!

35:14.845 --> 35:16.885
CROWD: Ooooh.

35:16.925 --> 35:18.805
Let me through! Out of the way!

35:22.485 --> 35:24.885
No! He's going to kill you! No!

35:32.365 --> 35:34.965
She told him to do it. I
heard. That's why she sold me!

35:36.605 --> 35:40.085
What?He's exaggerating. It's what
he does. You know how he goes on.

35:40.125 --> 35:43.445
I'm telling the truth
- to save your life, just like I said I would.

35:43.485 --> 35:46.885
I warned you what would happen
the next time you crossed me!

35:46.925 --> 35:48.685
Kill him! Arrest the others!

35:50.645 --> 35:52.165
Follow me, boys!Stop them!

35:52.205 --> 35:53.765
Stop!

35:55.845 --> 35:57.485
Kill them!

35:58.565 --> 36:01.565
You sold him! I had no
choice. The Sheriff...

36:01.605 --> 36:05.885
No! She sold me because I heard
her talking about killing you!What?

36:05.925 --> 36:07.685
She was going to
get Titus to do it.

36:07.725 --> 36:12.845
No, you don't understand! If I didn't do what
the Sheriff told me, he was going to kill us all.

36:12.885 --> 36:14.485
What an excellent idea!

36:19.285 --> 36:23.645
So, exactly how far did
you think you'd get, Bertha?

36:23.685 --> 36:25.605
We had a deal.The deal is off.

36:25.645 --> 36:27.645
You do not touch those children.

36:27.685 --> 36:30.125
No, no, I just want the
money from the wagers.

36:30.165 --> 36:32.365
She's welcome to the slaving money.

36:34.965 --> 36:35.965
What?

36:36.005 --> 36:43.925
Oh, I suppose she told you that she took the children
off the street out of the goodness of her heart?

36:43.965 --> 36:47.685
Look at them. They're
healthy and well-fed...

36:47.725 --> 36:51.725
Healthier children
fetch a bigger price!

36:51.765 --> 36:53.725
She's being doing it for years.

36:53.765 --> 36:56.245
Taking waifs and
strays off the streets,

36:56.285 --> 36:59.725
fattening them up, and then selling
them on at the end of the season.

36:59.765 --> 37:00.765
Have you?

37:00.805 --> 37:03.525
Yes, not this year though.

37:03.565 --> 37:05.285
Take her to the dungeons.No!

37:05.325 --> 37:07.605
Oh, and...arrest those.

37:07.645 --> 37:11.925
Leave them be!
Somebody kill that man.

37:23.645 --> 37:24.685
Run!

37:24.725 --> 37:26.645
Come on, boys!Run!

37:26.685 --> 37:29.045
I leave you alone for
one minute, John...

37:29.085 --> 37:33.165
Get back, get back!

37:33.205 --> 37:36.605
It used to be safe for children
in Nottingham.So says the outlaw.

37:36.645 --> 37:39.205
But, for once, I am
pleased to see you, Hood.

37:39.245 --> 37:44.005
It means that Gisborne has snatched
defeat from the jaws of victory once again!

37:44.045 --> 37:45.165
After them!

37:53.525 --> 37:55.685
Open it!

37:55.725 --> 37:57.965
Idiots! Open it!

38:00.805 --> 38:04.205
Who will watch out for
me now? You're safe now.

38:04.245 --> 38:07.205
No-one's gonna hurt you.
Everything's gonna be fine.

38:10.005 --> 38:11.125
Thank you.Thank you.

38:14.485 --> 38:17.805
John!

38:19.685 --> 38:21.085
I want to stay with you.

38:23.125 --> 38:25.325
I know.

38:25.365 --> 38:27.645
But it wouldn't be safe.

38:29.325 --> 38:33.205
I have a job to do, Walt. Helping
other people who are in trouble.

38:33.245 --> 38:37.405
I can't do that if
I'm looking after you.

38:37.445 --> 38:39.525
But I could look after you.

38:39.565 --> 38:41.245
I saved his life.

38:41.285 --> 38:43.645
Walt...

38:43.685 --> 38:46.245
Will I ever see you again?

38:46.285 --> 38:49.485
I hope so.

38:51.085 --> 38:52.725
Good luck.

38:52.765 --> 38:56.485
Take care of your brother. Take
care of each other.Thank you.

39:01.085 --> 39:02.765
Can I help you?

39:04.045 --> 39:06.605
Well might you hang your
head in shame, Gisborne.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.285
You've let him escape, again,

39:08.325 --> 39:11.645
and this...this! Is
this what distracted you?

39:11.685 --> 39:13.885
This is my sister.

39:15.085 --> 39:19.205
Oh, oh, I'm so sorry. You were
busy playing happy families?

39:21.605 --> 39:26.965
Well, your level of incompetence never,
ever ceases to amaze me, Gisborne.

39:27.005 --> 39:33.085
Every time I think you've plumbed a new depth,
along you come, and surprise me all over again.

39:33.125 --> 39:39.645
Well, maybe now Prince John will
remember why he put me in command!

40:01.245 --> 40:02.885
Is this what you're looking for?

40:02.925 --> 40:04.565
That's mine!

40:07.165 --> 40:08.205
Not your mistress'?

40:08.245 --> 40:12.045
If I'd have known you were Gisborne's
sister... You'd have killed me?

40:12.085 --> 40:14.165
And after I had already saved you.

40:14.205 --> 40:17.125
You made your choice when you
lied! You think I have a choice?

40:17.165 --> 40:20.245
My fate has been decided
for me since I was a child.

40:20.285 --> 40:22.965
You knew it was him chasing
us, and you said nothing.

40:23.005 --> 40:25.845
I didn't know it was
him! He's your brother!

40:25.885 --> 40:28.925
I hadn't seen him
since I was thirteen.

40:28.965 --> 40:32.245
When I realised... I was shocked.

40:32.285 --> 40:34.165
You have to believe me.

40:35.165 --> 40:39.125
No. That's the last
thing I have to do.

40:39.165 --> 40:42.365
Because you've been lying
to me ever since we met.

40:42.405 --> 40:45.645
You know, I preferred
you as a wronged servant.

40:45.685 --> 40:52.005
So do I. Better that, than a wronged sister,
who was sold to her husband like a piece of meat.

40:52.045 --> 40:55.125
I couldn't tell you
I was Lady Thornton.

40:55.165 --> 40:58.525
You're...you're Robin Hood.

40:58.565 --> 41:00.365
I know what you do to nobles.

41:01.925 --> 41:05.245
I never turn my back on
someone in true need.Good.

41:05.285 --> 41:07.365
Because that's exactly what I am.

41:14.205 --> 41:17.365
Goodbye, Isabella.

41:21.165 --> 41:23.205
And thank you for the donation.

41:37.085 --> 41:41.365
Welcome to Nottingham, Your
Highness.Long live King John!

41:41.405 --> 41:42.845
Long live me.

41:42.885 --> 41:44.205
Robin Hood isn't dead.

41:44.245 --> 41:47.565
His blood is a gift I covet,
and yet no-one gives it me.

41:49.165 --> 41:50.285
Italian or Spanish?

41:50.325 --> 41:51.565
Which do you prefer?

41:52.965 --> 41:54.285
Kate?

41:54.325 --> 41:58.885
You will kill the Sheriff for me,
Gisborne. Only the two of us will know.

41:58.925 --> 42:01.885
Wait until they're all inside,
then burn it to the ground.
