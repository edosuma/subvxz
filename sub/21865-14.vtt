Riggs!

10:34.467 --> 10:35.837
We're under siege!

10:35.837 --> 10:36.939
No. It was a rock.

10:36.939 --> 10:38.342
Listen, you've been made,
all right?

10:38.342 --> 10:40.446
Get down the street.
Get down!

11:02.858 --> 11:03.960
Hey, sis.

11:03.960 --> 11:06.431
Why do we always see each other
in places like this?

11:09.905 --> 11:11.441
(grunts)

11:18.990 --> 11:20.527

11:22.865 --> 11:24.802

11:28.877 --> 11:31.014

You're under arrest.

11:31.014 --> 11:33.218
You're welcome.

11:33.218 --> 11:34.622
What?

11:34.622 --> 11:38.128
You know, that rock
almost knocked my eye out.

11:38.128 --> 11:41.368
Or, "Thank you, Riggs.
That rock saved my life."

11:42.871 --> 11:44.340
The <i>car</i> saved my life.

11:44.340 --> 11:47.013
The car is the one
that knocked that dude down.

11:47.013 --> 11:48.015
After I shot him.

11:48.015 --> 11:49.652
That was a flesh wound.
You barely grazed him.

11:49.652 --> 11:52.390
You know what?
Bailey's never like this.

12:00.039 --> 12:01.107
Come on.
Why are these necessary?

12:01.107 --> 12:03.478
Name and date of birth?
You know my date of birth.

12:03.478 --> 12:05.115
You're always sending
stupid books.

12:05.115 --> 12:07.320
Oh, you got 'em?
Never even got a thank you.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.959
You're exactly the same.
You know what your problem is?

12:09.959 --> 12:12.296
You never give me
the benefit of the doubt.

12:12.296 --> 12:15.102
No, my problem is I always give
you the benefit of the doubt.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.939
But not anymore.
Consequences.

12:16.939 --> 12:19.545
I've changed. I have a steady
job, I have a boyfriend...

12:19.545 --> 12:21.649
Who got killed by a drug dealer.

12:21.649 --> 12:23.018
Ah, small wrinkle.

12:23.018 --> 12:25.255
Drexel's alibi checked out.

12:25.255 --> 12:26.926
He was at the
club all night.

12:26.926 --> 12:28.930
MURTAUGH:
Jess Bailey,

12:28.930 --> 12:30.332
in the house!

12:30.332 --> 12:31.535
Look at that.

12:31.535 --> 12:34.641
I‐I do see a resemblance.

12:34.641 --> 12:36.612
And when was someone
gonna tell me about this?!

12:36.612 --> 12:38.616
Can we table this?

12:38.616 --> 12:39.952
Hmm. Hmm?

12:39.952 --> 12:42.958
If it wasn't Drexel,
what other dealer

12:42.958 --> 12:44.360
would want to kill
your boyfriend?

12:44.360 --> 12:46.064
See, why does it
have to be a drug dealer?

12:46.064 --> 12:48.001
Why do you always assume
the worst?
Gee, I don't know,

12:48.001 --> 12:49.270
maybe 'cause he had cash on hand

12:49.270 --> 12:51.274
and a gaping hole
where his eye used to be.

12:51.274 --> 12:53.345
Well, a lot you know, because
it wasn't cash from drugs,

12:53.345 --> 12:56.084
it was from wallets
that we stole.

12:56.084 --> 12:58.723
What wallet?
Don't get judgy.

12:58.723 --> 13:01.562
Just... stuff we picked
off rich guys at the club.

13:01.562 --> 13:04.200
Did you pay for the hotel
with a stolen credit card?

13:04.200 --> 13:06.404
No, cash. We're not dumb.

13:06.404 --> 13:07.273
Duh.

13:08.208 --> 13:09.945
But we did order champagne

13:09.945 --> 13:11.615
to the room on plastic.

13:11.615 --> 13:12.651
RIGGS:
All right.

13:12.651 --> 13:13.452
Well, we'll go check into that.

13:13.452 --> 13:15.990
Are we good here?
No, we are not.

13:15.990 --> 13:18.161
I want to know,
why did you tell Riggs

13:18.161 --> 13:19.998
about your sister,
but you didn't tell me?

13:19.998 --> 13:22.704
Honestly, I was embarrassed,
and I knew Riggs wouldn't care.

13:22.704 --> 13:24.340
Why are you embarrassed of me?

13:24.340 --> 13:26.010
And why would
I not care?

13:26.010 --> 13:27.413
'Cause you're such
a mess yourself.

13:27.413 --> 13:29.016
Well...
AVERY: Hey, Riggs,

13:29.016 --> 13:30.052
I just got
off the phone with I. A.

13:30.052 --> 13:31.187
Any reason why

13:31.187 --> 13:33.058
a bartender would take out

13:33.058 --> 13:35.129
a restraining order
against you last night?

13:35.129 --> 13:37.366
Last night...

13:37.366 --> 13:39.605
No, but I'll check into that.

13:44.046 --> 13:45.583
(phone ringing)

13:45.583 --> 13:46.484
Yeah?

13:46.484 --> 13:48.388
Yeah, it's, uh, Martin Riggs.
I was...

13:48.388 --> 13:50.092
I know exactly who you are.

13:50.092 --> 13:52.229
I put a restraining order
on you,

13:52.229 --> 13:54.701
and obviously,
you don't obey any laws.

13:54.701 --> 13:57.339
There's a lot of truth to that.
Look, I'm, uh...

13:57.339 --> 13:59.143
Look, you got your nerve
calling here.

13:59.143 --> 14:01.214
Court say you had to stay
50 feet away.

14:01.214 --> 14:03.051
Pretty sure that includes
phone calls.

14:03.051 --> 14:05.422
Listen, I'm very sorry for
whatever it is I did last night.

14:05.422 --> 14:06.725
I don't have much
of a recollection.

14:06.725 --> 14:08.629
Uh, so if you could help me
and tell me,

14:08.629 --> 14:10.733
did you happen to see
how I left your bar?

14:10.733 --> 14:12.336
We sent you home in a cab.

14:12.336 --> 14:14.608
You lucky I didn't
kick your ass.

14:14.608 --> 14:16.612
All right, again, I'm very sorry
for anything I may have done.

14:16.612 --> 14:19.417

16:44.273 --> 16:46.277
Should I have a lawyer here
or something?

16:46.277 --> 16:48.849
He may have shoved an ice pick

Jess stole his wallet.

16:57.232 --> 16:58.334
Allegedly.

16:58.334 --> 17:01.173
Huh. Because we just received
surveillance footage

17:01.173 --> 17:02.810
from Jess's manager at the club.

17:03.746 --> 17:06.117
asking when Jess's shift
starts tonight.

17:06.117 --> 17:07.219
Probably wants his wallet back.

17:07.219 --> 17:08.822

17:08.822 --> 17:10.626
Oh, why?

20:29.691 --> 20:30.993
Jess!

20:35.836 --> 20:37.105
(gunshot)

20:37.105 --> 20:38.575
(crowd screaming)

20:38.575 --> 20:39.777
Get down.

20:42.182 --> 20:44.520
Riggs!

20:44.520 --> 20:45.522
Riggs.

20:46.758 --> 20:48.695
Riggs.

20:50.899 --> 20:52.803
(panting)

21:01.688 --> 21:04.493
Don't you dare say it.

21:04.493 --> 21:05.729
And you...

21:05.729 --> 21:08.869
didn't want me
drinking at work.

21:17.874 --> 21:20.526
Ask him what stopped the bullet;
go ahead, ask him.

21:20.526 --> 21:21.661
So you're suggesting what?

21:21.661 --> 21:23.532
That I didn't have my flask
when the twins shot me?

21:23.532 --> 21:25.602
Is that it?
It was one guy, Riggs.

21:25.602 --> 21:27.172
You saw the perp's reflection
in the mirror,

21:27.172 --> 21:28.975
and you got confused.
So you were drinking?

21:28.975 --> 21:30.144
No, no.

21:30.144 --> 21:31.614
A very nice young lady,

21:31.614 --> 21:33.618
uh, asked me
to do shots with her.

21:33.618 --> 21:34.787
I didn't want to
blow my cover.

21:34.787 --> 21:36.457
Besides,
a couple shots is,

21:36.457 --> 21:37.726
you know, not‐‐
I can do that before breakfast.

21:37.726 --> 21:38.895
My point made.

21:38.895 --> 21:40.465
RIGGS: What's your point?
No, Cap, this is all on me.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.068
I was supposed to be
looking after Jess,

21:42.068 --> 21:43.805
and I lost her.

21:43.805 --> 21:45.007
What are you doing, Bailey?

21:45.007 --> 21:47.546
Now, this is when you're
supposed to blame someone else.

21:47.546 --> 21:49.116
Blame him.
Blame him.
I was being honest.

21:49.116 --> 21:50.886
AVERY:
Okay, the‐the good news,

21:50.886 --> 21:52.790
the good news is
that we have a make

21:52.790 --> 21:54.092
on the killer's car.

21:54.092 --> 21:55.896
A two‐tone burgundy
old‐school sedan.

21:55.896 --> 21:58.267
And this just came in
for the former Mr. Bristo.

21:58.267 --> 22:01.508
Apparently, his primary work
as an accountant involved

22:01.508 --> 22:03.512
cooking the books
for the Minnesota mob.

22:03.512 --> 22:04.747
The Minnesota mob?

22:04.747 --> 22:06.951
What, do they extort people
on the one day out of the year

22:06.951 --> 22:08.020
they can go outside?

22:08.020 --> 22:10.759
They call it sleeping with
the ice fishes. (laughs)

22:11.995 --> 22:14.065
Because it's cold when they...

22:16.003 --> 22:17.506
(Riggs sighs)

22:17.506 --> 22:18.575
AVERY:
St. Paul PD

22:18.575 --> 22:20.946
thinks that he embezzled money
from his employers

22:20.946 --> 22:22.182
before he skipped town.

22:22.182 --> 22:25.488
So, therefore, when CJ used
his credit card at the hotel...

22:25.488 --> 22:27.258
Hit man showed up looking for
Bristo and the money,

22:27.258 --> 22:28.595
and he got CJ instead.

22:28.595 --> 22:29.597
RIGGS:
The guy who killed Bristo was

22:29.597 --> 22:31.500
the one trying to hustle Jess
out of the club.

22:31.500 --> 22:32.536
We have two
dead bodies already.

22:32.536 --> 22:33.638
Let's get to her before they do.

22:35.509 --> 22:37.513
I'm sorry, Cap,
but there's one more thing.

22:37.513 --> 22:40.586
Hey, Bailey, you know what?
We should probably go check

22:40.586 --> 22:42.656
Jess's apartment, right?
Yes.

22:42.656 --> 22:44.560
See if there's any leads
or clues or... Never know.

22:44.560 --> 22:45.629
Maybe some, uh, some...

22:50.739 --> 22:51.975
(clears throat)

22:51.975 --> 22:53.310
Murtaugh,
I got the parabolic mic

22:53.310 --> 22:54.880
and the night vision goggles
you requested,

22:54.880 --> 22:56.718
but it's‐it's a
no‐go on the drone.

22:56.718 --> 22:57.753
You requested a drone?

22:57.753 --> 23:00.124
I did.

23:00.124 --> 23:01.728
To widen out the, uh,

23:01.728 --> 23:04.132
search radius for
the two‐tone sedan

23:04.132 --> 23:06.671
that we are all looking for.
I'm surprised you didn't...

23:06.671 --> 23:09.242
You <i>just</i> found out
about that right here,

23:09.242 --> 23:10.979
30 seconds ago.
And then, um...

23:10.979 --> 23:12.750
I ca... (sighs)

23:14.887 --> 23:18.027
(groans) Okay.

23:18.027 --> 23:19.864
I have chips.

23:19.864 --> 23:21.868
I have dip.

23:21.868 --> 23:24.640
And I have sip.
(laughs)

23:24.640 --> 23:26.944
Does your dad know how to make
a stakeout fun or what?

23:26.944 --> 23:28.080
Shh.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.182
Shh.

23:29.182 --> 23:30.652
What's he doing?

23:30.652 --> 23:33.223
Still, uh, doing homework?

23:33.223 --> 23:36.597
Oh, so it would seem.

23:36.597 --> 23:37.766
You know, you may have to face

23:37.766 --> 23:40.004
the fact that
your boy's not cheating,

23:40.004 --> 23:42.008
he's just slow at geometry.

23:42.008 --> 23:43.077
Dad.
I'm saying, just,

23:43.077 --> 23:45.849
A‐squared equals
B‐squared equals

23:45.849 --> 23:46.751
the dork that he is.

23:46.751 --> 23:48.120
RIANA:
That waitress‐‐ it's Charlotte.

23:48.120 --> 23:49.757
Look.

23:49.757 --> 23:51.293
I'm... Okay.

23:52.796 --> 23:55.635
Okay, well, maybe it's a
coincidence and she works here.

23:55.635 --> 23:57.940
She's drinking from his straw.

23:57.940 --> 24:00.144
MURTAUGH: Which means
he has an underdeveloped

24:00.144 --> 24:01.547
phobia for germs.

24:04.018 --> 24:05.589
Uh‐oh...

24:07.693 --> 24:09.597
Ri. Ri.

24:09.597 --> 24:10.999
Hey. Hey!

24:10.999 --> 24:13.972
Young lady!

24:13.972 --> 24:15.609
No...

24:15.609 --> 24:17.813
(laughs)

24:17.813 --> 24:19.683
That's my baby girl.

24:19.683 --> 24:22.288
(laughs)

24:22.288 --> 24:23.558
(door opens)

24:25.327 --> 24:28.000
I am so proud of you...

24:28.000 --> 24:30.639
Please say something comforting
or I'm gonna lose it.

24:34.179 --> 24:37.586
Uh... let's call your mother.

24:39.623 --> 24:41.694
RIGGS:
<i>All right.</i>

24:41.694 --> 24:43.197
Any other ideas
where she might be?

24:43.197 --> 24:45.000
No.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.205
We didn't stay close
after our mom died.

24:47.205 --> 24:49.810
I had to get the hell out
of there as soon as I could.

24:49.810 --> 24:51.747
Says a lot about me,
though, right?

24:51.747 --> 24:53.150
I left her.
I don't know, Bailey.

24:53.150 --> 24:55.755
Nothing wrong with wanting
a better draw than you got.

24:59.062 --> 25:00.732
(sighs)

25:00.732 --> 25:02.736
What about you?
You got siblings?

25:04.807 --> 25:06.878
No.

25:06.878 --> 25:10.585
Just me and my old man,
stuck in that house together.

25:12.656 --> 25:14.593
(phone vibrating)

25:17.733 --> 25:19.135
Think Bowman's got a lead
on my truck.

25:19.135 --> 25:20.204
It's all right, it can wait.

25:20.204 --> 25:21.908
No, it's cool.

25:21.908 --> 25:24.713
We don't know where Jess is
anyway, and we need to find

25:24.713 --> 25:25.749
your truck so we
can give Murtaugh

25:25.749 --> 25:27.218
one less thing
to complain about.

25:27.218 --> 25:28.688
Let's go.

25:32.228 --> 25:34.232
Hey, how are you?

25:34.232 --> 25:35.367
You.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.706
You're the crazy man
that was in my cab last night.

25:37.706 --> 25:39.977
Oh. "Crazy" like, uh,
like, crazy fun?

25:39.977 --> 25:41.112
Like it was...

25:41.112 --> 25:42.716
too much of a
good time to...

25:42.716 --> 25:44.185
All right.

25:44.185 --> 25:46.691
Um... I've misplaced my truck.

25:46.691 --> 25:48.761
So, when you picked me up
from the bar last night,

25:48.761 --> 25:50.431
do you remember
where you took me?

25:50.431 --> 25:52.836
A self‐service car wash,
on Pico.

25:52.836 --> 25:55.742
But if I was in your cab,
how did I get my truck there?

25:55.742 --> 25:57.779
No, crazy man.
There was no truck.

25:57.779 --> 25:59.082
You washed yourself.

25:59.082 --> 26:00.885
Oh.

26:00.885 --> 26:02.088
Wh‐What's that?

26:02.088 --> 26:04.258
You hosed yourself down like
it was a damn public shower.

26:04.258 --> 26:05.762
And then,
when it was finished,

26:05.762 --> 26:07.666
you ripped open
the token machine

26:07.666 --> 26:09.402
and then
you just started again.

26:09.402 --> 26:12.008
Kept saying you had
to get yourself right.

26:12.008 --> 26:14.647
NATHAN:
<i>Got to get right.</i>

26:18.955 --> 26:20.257
(grunts)

26:20.257 --> 26:21.994
Keep going!

26:21.994 --> 26:24.298
Social worker's gonna be
out here in a minute.

26:24.298 --> 26:26.302
Got to get right.

26:26.302 --> 26:28.273
Got to get my mind right.

26:28.273 --> 26:30.812
Dad, let me get someone to help.

26:30.812 --> 26:33.818
Riggs men don't ask for help.

26:33.818 --> 26:36.356
I just got to get sobered up.

26:36.356 --> 26:37.959
Now, come on!

26:37.959 --> 26:39.897
Come on.

26:42.869 --> 26:44.773
HELEN:
<i>Martin's teacher said</i>

26:44.773 --> 26:46.911
that he's become withdrawn
the past few weeks.

26:46.911 --> 26:48.480
And the number of school
days he's missed

26:48.480 --> 26:50.117
since his mother passed...
Mm.

26:50.117 --> 26:53.056
Ah, there's n‐nothing
unnatural about that.

26:53.056 --> 26:54.425
Boy misses his mom.

26:54.425 --> 26:56.196
We both do.

26:56.196 --> 26:57.799
Very much.
Of course.

26:57.799 --> 27:00.905
I just want you to know
that Social Services is here

27:00.905 --> 27:04.112
to help if things
ever get too...

27:04.112 --> 27:05.447
difficult.

27:05.447 --> 27:08.153
We appreciate
your concern.

27:08.153 --> 27:10.057
But, you know, Martin and me,

27:10.057 --> 27:12.294
we're... we're doing
okay out here, aren't we?

27:12.294 --> 27:13.965
Isn't that right, son?

27:20.043 --> 27:21.847
Thanks a lot.

27:21.847 --> 27:22.849
Hey, pal?

27:22.849 --> 27:25.287
Whatever you did last night,
it didn't work.

27:25.287 --> 27:28.828
You're not right.
You need help.

27:32.067 --> 27:34.807
(siren wailing)

27:55.849 --> 27:59.422
<i>(carousel music playing)</i>

27:59.422 --> 28:01.760
(children laughing, shouting)

28:25.495 --> 28:26.776
A leave of absence?

28:26.776 --> 28:31.854
Look, what happened at the club
was not your fault, entirely.

28:31.854 --> 28:33.824
It's not just
the club, Cap.

28:33.824 --> 28:35.595
I've been coloring
outside the lines.

28:35.595 --> 28:37.331
And I withheld evidence
from a crime scene

28:37.331 --> 28:39.201
to protect my sister.

28:39.201 --> 28:40.905
How do I justify that?

28:40.905 --> 28:42.007
Well, clearly,
you've been spending

28:42.007 --> 28:43.276
too much time with Riggs.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.219
MURTAUGH:
What's going on in there?

28:48.219 --> 28:49.990
I'm not sure, but it looks
like Bailey's quitting.

28:49.990 --> 28:51.259
What?!

28:51.259 --> 28:52.896
Why would she quit?

28:52.896 --> 28:54.298
Maybe this thing
with her sister.

28:54.298 --> 28:56.503
Yeah, we were talking
in the car, and she said...

28:56.503 --> 28:59.241
Oh, oh. Uh, uh.
Of course.

28:59.241 --> 29:01.479
It's you. You said something
to her, didn't you?

29:01.479 --> 29:03.884
Yes, Rog, I said something,
she said something.

29:03.884 --> 29:05.320
It's called a conversation.

29:05.320 --> 29:07.291
You know? We were sharing
family baggage.

29:07.291 --> 29:08.326
Oh, were you, now?

29:08.326 --> 29:10.497
You got any baggage you
want to share with me?

29:10.497 --> 29:11.700
Nope.

29:11.700 --> 29:14.573
You know what? You better not
have gotten into her head.

29:14.573 --> 29:17.979
I put a lot of time and
mentorship into that young lady.

29:17.979 --> 29:20.450
Where'd she go?

29:20.450 --> 29:22.187
RIGGS:
I don't know.

29:22.187 --> 29:24.893
I'm guessing she disappeared
while you were babbling.

29:26.095 --> 29:27.231
Hey.

29:27.231 --> 29:29.903
Uh, so the gunman from the club,
we got a hit on the car.

29:29.903 --> 29:32.107
He was spotted on
Sunset and Alvarado.

29:32.107 --> 29:33.878
That's near Jess's place.

29:33.878 --> 29:35.948
I need your keys, Bowman.

29:35.948 --> 29:37.585
Uh, okay.

29:37.585 --> 29:39.923
Thanks.

29:41.927 --> 29:43.329
Hey, to your car.

29:43.329 --> 29:44.498
Oh, right. Yeah.

29:44.498 --> 29:46.002
That's your apartment, so...

29:46.002 --> 29:47.204
Great.

29:53.551 --> 29:55.153
(keys clatter)

29:55.153 --> 29:57.091
(exhales)

30:00.263 --> 30:02.067
(gasps)

30:02.067 --> 30:03.938
Nice place you got.
You scared the hell out of me.

30:03.938 --> 30:06.543
Good. You need better locks.
It's easy pickings.

30:06.543 --> 30:08.480
What the hell
are you doing here?

30:08.480 --> 30:11.954
Okay, this is why CJ got killed.

30:11.954 --> 30:15.227
It's to a bike locker
in Griffith Park,

30:15.227 --> 30:16.663
by the carousel.

30:16.663 --> 30:20.003
Inside it is
a bag full of money.

30:20.003 --> 30:22.107
Millions, by my count.

30:22.107 --> 30:24.411
You found millions of dollars
in a bag,

30:24.411 --> 30:26.415
and you came back here.

30:26.415 --> 30:29.021
Well, it was either that

30:29.021 --> 30:31.593
or hear from you
for the hundredth time

30:31.593 --> 30:35.601
that I always screw up
and make bad decisions.

30:35.601 --> 30:38.373
I'm proud of you.

30:38.373 --> 30:41.145
Oh... stop. You ruined
a perfectly nice moment.

30:41.145 --> 30:42.949
(knocking on door)
Stay here.

30:45.655 --> 30:47.625
Murtaugh, listen, um...

30:47.625 --> 30:49.428
You quit?

30:49.428 --> 30:51.633
And you didn't even
think to tell me.

30:51.633 --> 30:52.569
I'm not quitting.

30:52.569 --> 30:54.405
It's an indefinite
leave of absence.

30:54.405 --> 30:55.575
That's quitting.

30:55.575 --> 30:57.044
You had
a teachable moment.

30:57.044 --> 30:59.649
You learned not to bend
the rules, but now...

30:59.649 --> 31:01.085
Jess is inside.

31:01.085 --> 31:03.489
And you didn't tell anyone?

31:03.489 --> 31:06.028
It's Riggs.

31:06.028 --> 31:07.364
He's a menace.

31:17.785 --> 31:20.123
(door creaking)

31:22.595 --> 31:24.532
(clattering)

31:33.651 --> 31:36.489
Well, young man, I hope you know
you're gonna clean this mess up.

31:36.489 --> 31:39.028
(both grunting)

31:46.075 --> 31:48.346
(choking)

31:48.346 --> 31:50.116
All right,
where's the other you?

31:50.116 --> 31:51.218
(choking)
Huh?

31:51.218 --> 31:52.287
You know, your twin?

31:52.287 --> 31:55.060
MAN: Nah. That was a much
better looking fellow.

31:57.598 --> 32:00.705
You just got to flush all
that Riggs out of your system.

32:00.705 --> 32:02.174
I got to get back to Jess.

32:02.174 --> 32:04.579
(gun cocks)
Guns.

32:04.579 --> 32:07.417
We got to get you in
a more secure building, Bailey.

32:07.417 --> 32:08.520
Jess Bailey?

32:08.520 --> 32:11.092
She skipped town.
She's gone.

32:11.092 --> 32:12.729
But, um, she
gave me this.

32:12.729 --> 32:15.233
Let's go.
Both of you.

32:15.233 --> 32:18.139
Plenty of room
in the sedan.

32:18.139 --> 32:20.410
Hey, I'm sorry
I got you into this.

32:20.410 --> 32:22.214
Don't blame
yourself, Bailey.

32:22.214 --> 32:24.184
It's Riggs's fault.

32:24.184 --> 32:25.120
It's always Riggs.

32:36.142 --> 32:37.545
(engine slowing)

32:37.545 --> 32:38.814
(tires screech)

32:38.814 --> 32:40.283
We're stopping.

32:40.283 --> 32:42.120
This is where he
kills us, isn't it?

32:42.120 --> 32:43.389
Hey, not gonna happen, Bailey.

32:43.389 --> 32:45.761
Take your mind off of that.
(car door closes)

32:45.761 --> 32:47.765
Describe the man who grabbed us

32:47.765 --> 32:50.203
for when we testify
against him in court.

32:50.203 --> 32:52.240
That's how this ends,
okay? Go.

32:52.240 --> 32:54.144
Okay, um, five‐ten.

32:54.144 --> 32:56.783
Mm‐hmm. Mm‐hmm.
Blonde, mustache.

32:59.254 --> 33:02.194
Whoa. What was that?

33:02.194 --> 33:04.097
Wh‐What, the shovel?

33:04.097 --> 33:06.101
No. No mustache.

33:06.101 --> 33:09.141
Either he shaved while driving
or it was fake.

33:09.141 --> 33:11.479
Either way, he doesn't
want to be identified.

33:15.186 --> 33:17.224
Okay, I did not see that.

33:17.224 --> 33:19.194
What, the shovel <i>and</i>
the tarp, Murtaugh?

33:19.194 --> 33:22.167
The mustache. It's a very
realistic synthetic blend.

33:22.167 --> 33:23.871
I mean, but why?

33:23.871 --> 33:26.141
Is he trying to mess with
our facial recognition?

33:26.141 --> 33:27.778
I'm sure there's
another explanation,

33:27.778 --> 33:29.516
like he's gonna
bury us alive.

33:29.516 --> 33:30.684
(footsteps approaching)

33:30.684 --> 33:32.822
Just so you don't

33:32.822 --> 33:34.692
get any ideas,
your dumb‐ass partner

33:34.692 --> 33:36.262
is inside tied up.

33:36.262 --> 33:39.536
Try anything,
and my brother will kill him.

33:39.536 --> 33:42.240
Go babysit the guy inside.

33:42.240 --> 33:44.779
Yep, I get it.
Now there's three of 'em.

33:44.779 --> 33:45.881
Makes sense.
(car doors close)

33:45.881 --> 33:48.887
Well, can we talk about the
tarp and the shovel now?

33:48.887 --> 33:50.858
(engine starts)
Yeah.

34:04.318 --> 34:05.320
(trunk squeaks)

34:05.320 --> 34:06.121
Let's go, missy.

34:06.121 --> 34:07.390
No, no, no, no.
Hey, let her stay.

34:07.390 --> 34:08.459
Take me.
Uh...

34:08.459 --> 34:10.564
Oh, don't worry, fella.
You'll get your chance.

34:10.564 --> 34:12.702
Sit tight.

34:19.281 --> 34:21.285
Three of you, huh?

34:22.220 --> 34:24.358
How does that...
how does that work,

34:24.358 --> 34:27.297
like, with, uh,
with the clothes situation?

34:29.736 --> 34:32.207
No. I'm‐I'm genuinely curious.

34:32.207 --> 34:34.946
You know, like when I see
children, uh, you know,

34:34.946 --> 34:36.783
walking around the streets,
you know, regarding twins

34:36.783 --> 34:38.854
or‐or triplets,
they're always dressed the same,

34:38.854 --> 34:40.390
and it's adorable,
so I wasn't,

34:40.390 --> 34:42.494
you know, sure if you guys
did that kind of thing

34:42.494 --> 34:43.997
where you buy‐‐ I don't know‐‐

34:43.997 --> 34:45.901
three blue shirts,
three red jackets,

34:45.901 --> 34:48.573
or if you took advantage
of the multiple wardrobes.

34:48.573 --> 34:50.343
If I shoot you,
will you shut up?

34:50.343 --> 34:51.880
It's worth a shot.

34:54.351 --> 34:55.754
(gunshot)

35:01.766 --> 35:03.837
(panting)

35:10.349 --> 35:12.588
(cell phone ringing)

35:14.826 --> 35:16.395
Yeah, Bailey.

35:16.395 --> 35:18.834
No, it's Jess. The ice pick guy
with the boots‐‐

35:18.834 --> 35:20.436
he took my sister
and your partner.

35:20.436 --> 35:22.207
Took 'em where?

35:29.922 --> 35:30.891
(shouts)

35:44.652 --> 35:46.388
(grunting)

36:02.420 --> 36:04.357
(tires screeching)

36:11.773 --> 36:13.375
Murtaugh's in the trunk!

36:13.375 --> 36:15.379
Murtaugh's
in the trunk!

36:20.757 --> 36:22.828
(shouting)

36:29.407 --> 36:32.313
Rog! Rog!

36:44.939 --> 36:46.943
MURTAUGH:
This is it?

36:46.943 --> 36:48.580
This is how you react

36:48.580 --> 36:50.116
when you think
I'm dead?

36:50.116 --> 36:52.521
What did you
expect me to do, Rog?

36:52.521 --> 36:55.359
Like, drop to my knees and have,
like, a whole dramatic episode?

36:55.359 --> 36:57.063
When you took that
bullet in a club

36:57.063 --> 36:58.733
and I thought you
was dead, I wept.

36:58.733 --> 37:00.737
It was tears of joy.

37:00.737 --> 37:02.407
What? What?

37:02.407 --> 37:04.612
You know, you wouldn't even go
in there and try to save me?

37:04.612 --> 37:07.250
Well, how am I gonna save you
if you're blown up?

37:14.431 --> 37:16.368
Give me a minute.

37:18.038 --> 37:20.711
So, I'm gonna call the D. A.
about the felony theft charges.

37:20.711 --> 37:22.347
Don't.
I'm pretty sure we can

37:22.347 --> 37:24.484
suspend the sentence,
considering...
I'm serious.

37:24.484 --> 37:25.620
Don't do it.

37:25.620 --> 37:28.492
This is on me now.

37:28.492 --> 37:29.962
Consequences.

37:33.002 --> 37:36.509
This is supposed to be in
evidence, so if anyone asks,

37:36.509 --> 37:37.811
just...

37:44.424 --> 37:45.594
Maybe when, uh,

37:45.594 --> 37:48.600
this all blows over, we can
go back to being cool again.

feel about ice cream

38:28.513 --> 38:32.019

from you,

38:50.590 --> 38:52.928
and please be straight
with me, okay?

38:52.928 --> 38:54.698
I need to know:

38:54.698 --> 38:57.704
is this as bad as it gets?

38:59.542 --> 39:01.546
No.

39:01.546 --> 39:02.981
It gets much worse.

39:02.981 --> 39:04.083
(sighs)

39:04.083 --> 39:07.925

39:07.925 --> 39:10.964

in‐in fighting shape

39:19.013 --> 39:20.617
You know?

39:20.617 --> 39:21.819
Okay.

39:23.523 --> 39:25.994
But how many times before Mom?

39:25.994 --> 39:28.800
Um, you know, it...

39:28.800 --> 39:32.473
it's different for everyone.

39:32.473 --> 39:34.878
This guy, double digits.

39:34.878 --> 39:38.620
I‐I was weak.
I was vulnerable.

39:38.620 --> 39:41.491
I mean, started losing my hair
when I was, like, 13.
(phone vibrating)

39:41.491 --> 39:43.128
It's Mom.

39:44.197 --> 39:45.600
But I don't have to.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.036
I mean, we're right
in the middle of...

39:47.036 --> 39:50.610

your mom's call.

39:59.027 --> 40:00.563

40:06.676 --> 40:08.746

Dad took me on a stakeout.

40:08.746 --> 40:11.217
He got the surveillance van
