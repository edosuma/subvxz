01:36.389 --> 01:38.558
Don't you wish you could paint like that?

01:38.641 --> 01:39.726
Oh, I'm sorry?

01:40.018 --> 01:42.854
I said, don't you wish
you could paint like your husband?

01:42.937 --> 01:46.024
Really. You must be
so proud of him.

01:50.195 --> 01:51.196
So elegant.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.907
Yes,
they're all Vejle, where he grew up.

01:53.990 --> 01:57.702
Now, I don't say my client is the
best landscape artist in Denmark,

01:57.786 --> 01:59.913
but he is
in the top one.

02:00.038 --> 02:01.456
Yes. Oh, hello!

02:01.581 --> 02:03.291
It's going very well.

02:03.374 --> 02:06.711
Mmm. Yes.
He'll be impossible.

02:07.587 --> 02:08.755
Oh, my.

02:16.846 --> 02:17.889
Oh, thank you.

02:18.014 --> 02:19.057
<i>And Rasmussen!</i>

02:19.182 --> 02:21.893
Oh, come on. Be kind. At least
he agreed to see your work.

02:22.018 --> 02:23.311
It was only because
he was drunk.

02:23.394 --> 02:24.395
I know.

02:24.479 --> 02:25.480
Yes, you were loving it.

02:25.563 --> 02:27.106
I was not!

02:27.732 --> 02:30.652
"I don't say my client is the best
landscape artist in Denmark..."

02:30.777 --> 02:31.778
But...

02:32.070 --> 02:33.738
"He's in the top one!"

02:34.030 --> 02:35.949
Quiet! People are sleeping.

02:36.032 --> 02:37.909
Sorry.

02:57.929 --> 02:59.097
Do you know
what time it is?

03:01.516 --> 03:03.434
Time you came
back to bed?

03:03.643 --> 03:04.644
No.

03:05.979 --> 03:07.981
I'm ready to start work.

03:10.108 --> 03:11.442
Gerda.
What?

03:13.653 --> 03:15.113
Your face.

03:17.407 --> 03:18.783
You think
I can't resist you?

03:19.450 --> 03:21.369
Do you want
to resist me?

03:23.329 --> 03:24.455
No.

03:24.622 --> 03:26.207
But I'd like you
to ask nicely,

03:26.291 --> 03:28.126
so I don't feel
such a pushover.

03:32.297 --> 03:33.756
Gerda Wegener.

03:35.884 --> 03:36.885
My life.

03:39.721 --> 03:41.389
My wife.

03:53.651 --> 03:54.694
Thorbjorn.

03:54.777 --> 03:55.904
Mr. Wegener.

04:02.827 --> 04:03.828
Tighter.

04:15.590 --> 04:16.841
Perfect.

04:24.307 --> 04:25.516
Yes. More.

04:32.857 --> 04:34.067
Einar Wegener.

04:35.109 --> 04:36.361
Oh, don't worry
about him.

04:37.570 --> 04:40.365
He's only ever had
eyes for one woman.

04:40.698 --> 04:42.617
My guilty secret's out.

04:42.700 --> 04:43.701
So,

04:43.785 --> 04:47.372
when are you two going to
brood me a godchild, huh?

04:47.455 --> 04:48.790
Ulla, you're an atheist.

04:48.873 --> 04:50.500
Have you tried
drinking raw eggs?

04:50.583 --> 04:51.918
No.
Do it.

04:52.001 --> 04:53.086
For my sake.

04:53.378 --> 04:55.338
We're trying.
Try harder.

04:55.755 --> 04:56.965
Anyway...

04:57.048 --> 04:59.133
What are you
doing in today?

04:59.801 --> 05:01.241
I thought you had
finished last week.

05:01.511 --> 05:04.764
I wanted to check on the painting of
the backdrop for the storm scene.

05:05.932 --> 05:07.725
And give Gerda some space.

05:07.892 --> 05:10.478
Ah. She's got
a shy one?

05:11.729 --> 05:13.314
Well, you know
I'm next.

05:13.398 --> 05:14.941
Oh... So I heard.

05:17.068 --> 05:18.403
I won't be shy.

05:18.528 --> 05:19.904
I should imagine not.

05:20.029 --> 05:22.824
She'll need all
her colors for me.

05:33.751 --> 05:34.919
Mmm-hmm.

05:40.675 --> 05:41.676
Mmm!

05:42.844 --> 05:44.178
Head up.

05:48.975 --> 05:52.395
I wanted to say I appreciate
our being alone today.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.442
I hope your husband
doesn't mind.

05:57.775 --> 05:59.110
Not at all.

06:00.153 --> 06:04.282
I could see his being here
made you uncomfortable.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.493
It wasn't personal.

06:09.287 --> 06:10.580
It's not uncommon.

06:11.330 --> 06:12.331
Ah.

06:13.499 --> 06:15.960
It's hard for a man to
be looked at by a woman.

06:16.502 --> 06:20.048
Women are used to it,
of course, but for a man to, um,

06:20.465 --> 06:23.801
submit to a woman's gaze.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.054
It's unsettling.

06:30.475 --> 06:33.394
Although I believe there's some
pleasure to be had from it,

06:33.561 --> 06:34.645
once you, um,

06:37.231 --> 06:38.691
yield.

06:41.110 --> 06:42.111
Sit.

06:42.820 --> 06:43.988
Good girl.

07:04.425 --> 07:05.843
Morning.
Morning.

07:20.691 --> 07:21.692
Well?

07:24.112 --> 07:25.154
Perfect.

07:29.659 --> 07:31.702
Almost.

07:32.411 --> 07:33.663
Ah.

07:45.383 --> 07:46.425
Good luck!

07:46.509 --> 07:48.219
Toodle-oo!

08:10.533 --> 08:11.659
All portraits.

08:12.410 --> 08:15.246
Is that bad?

08:17.165 --> 08:18.207
Not per Se.

08:31.971 --> 08:35.558
This kind of work
is not really my...

08:37.894 --> 08:41.772
Gerda, I don't think it would
benefit either of us to show these.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.776
It's not a judgment
on your abilities.

08:45.860 --> 08:48.070
I agree with Einar.

08:48.154 --> 08:50.406
You could be
a first-class painter

08:50.489 --> 08:52.700
if you found
the right subject matter.

09:05.046 --> 09:06.047
How was it?

09:06.547 --> 09:07.548
Fine.

09:09.217 --> 09:11.260
I finally managed to get
the color for the snow.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.180
A bog in Vejle.

09:15.556 --> 09:18.226
I don't know how you can paint
the same thing over and over.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.728
I suppose I just haven't
finished with it yet.

09:20.811 --> 09:21.812
Gerda?

09:21.938 --> 09:24.982
Could you please not speak
to Rasmussen about me again?

09:27.526 --> 09:29.737
My work is my business.

09:29.904 --> 09:31.614
Stay out of it.
Gerda.

09:59.892 --> 10:01.352
I have my period.

10:02.144 --> 10:03.187
Sorry.

10:04.689 --> 10:06.899
Are you?
Of course I am.

10:07.066 --> 10:08.567
I mean, you know I am.

10:15.533 --> 10:16.813
Could you help me
with something?

10:20.079 --> 10:21.122
Anything.

10:21.539 --> 10:23.958
Ulla has an extra rehearsal.
She canceled again.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.167
Oh.

10:26.252 --> 10:28.254
Would you try on
her stockings and shoes?

10:28.713 --> 10:30.172
I'm just so behind,
I don't know how

10:30.256 --> 10:31.716
I'll be finished in time
for her opening.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.009
Yeah, I'll...

10:33.217 --> 10:34.385
I'll do it.

10:34.969 --> 10:36.762
It's fine, I'll do it.

10:37.805 --> 10:38.889
They're there.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.759
Hvappe, no, not now.

11:15.593 --> 11:16.761
He almost snagged it.

11:17.553 --> 11:18.721
Hvappe.

11:22.099 --> 11:23.100
Uh...

11:23.726 --> 11:24.810
That's backwards.

11:35.029 --> 11:37.281
I saw those in the
window at Fonnesbech's.

11:37.365 --> 11:38.366
Hmm.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.701
Smart, aren't they?

11:41.035 --> 11:42.370
I don't think
they'll fit.

11:43.371 --> 11:44.538
Well, you do
the best you can.

12:05.768 --> 12:08.062
No, I need the dress.
No.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.688
I need to see
how the hem falls.

12:09.772 --> 12:10.856
No, Gerda, I'm not
putting it on.

12:11.023 --> 12:13.025
Well, I haven't
asked you to.

12:18.656 --> 12:20.157
Just relax.

12:21.659 --> 12:23.160
The sooner I start,

12:24.662 --> 12:26.330
the sooner I finish.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.130
Well, hello, there!

13:21.343 --> 13:23.429
Oh, don't worry,
my darling.

13:28.434 --> 13:30.436
We're going
to call you

13:33.189 --> 13:34.190
Lili.

13:56.253 --> 13:58.047
Such concentration.

14:00.549 --> 14:02.092
Sometimes I think
you're going to slip

14:02.176 --> 14:04.553
through the surface
of the painting and vanish.

14:04.637 --> 14:06.096
Into the bog.

14:08.432 --> 14:10.768
Like your friend's kite
when you were a boy.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.312
Hans.
Mmm.

14:13.395 --> 14:14.855
Yes, Hans.

14:18.692 --> 14:21.820
I bet he still sits
on that rock,

14:21.904 --> 14:23.030
sobbing his heart out.

14:23.113 --> 14:24.240
Don't.

14:26.116 --> 14:28.452
He's actually
an art dealer in Paris.

14:29.286 --> 14:32.206
Peddling old masters to
rich Americans. Hmm.

14:32.289 --> 14:34.041
So we don't need
to worry about Hans.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.252
No, we don't need
to worry about Hans.

14:38.796 --> 14:40.089
I didn't mean
to disturb you.

14:40.172 --> 14:42.299
No, it's okay.
I'm finished.

14:42.383 --> 14:45.803
And don't worry, I won't
disappear into the bog.

14:45.886 --> 14:48.681
The bog's in me, silly.

15:08.659 --> 15:09.702
What?

15:09.827 --> 15:12.246
Can't a man watch his
wife get undressed?

15:18.210 --> 15:19.503
It's new.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.089
That's very observant.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.177
Oh, no, leave it on.

15:42.151 --> 15:43.360
It's pretty.

15:45.946 --> 15:48.657
I might let you borrow it.

15:49.867 --> 15:51.410
I might enjoy that.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.912
Is there something
you'd like to tell me?

15:53.996 --> 15:55.331
Is there something
you'd like to know?

15:55.414 --> 15:56.624
No.

15:57.207 --> 15:58.542
I'm your wife.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.795
I know everything.

16:11.430 --> 16:12.931
Those two,
over there.

16:14.391 --> 16:15.976
Both of them?

16:16.060 --> 16:17.311
And at the same time.

16:18.479 --> 16:21.732
Oh, married people are so
delightfully easy to shock.

16:21.982 --> 16:24.526
We just pretend to be shocked
because it encourages you.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.487
I know.

16:26.570 --> 16:29.657
That is why you're the only married
couple in my party for the Artists' Ball.

16:29.740 --> 16:31.241
No.
Out of the question.

16:31.450 --> 16:32.618
She can go without me.

16:32.701 --> 16:36.538
Gerda without an escort?
Why, it would be a scandal!

16:36.914 --> 16:38.165
Gerda loves a scandal.

16:38.415 --> 16:39.625
Look at the way
she dresses.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.669
Flaunting her ankles.

16:41.752 --> 16:44.797
I don't think anyone is likely to
be corrupted by seeing my ankles.

16:44.922 --> 16:46.340
I was.

16:46.924 --> 16:49.093
It was the first time we met,
I was leaving the Academy

16:49.259 --> 16:52.096
and she was sitting on the
steps, flaunting said ankles.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.266
And she propositioned me.

16:56.767 --> 16:58.060
Is that true?

16:58.185 --> 17:00.604
When I said hello to him,
he actually blushed.

17:02.773 --> 17:05.442
He was so shy,
so I asked him out.

17:05.567 --> 17:06.819
And you said yes.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.278
Well, she made me.

17:09.738 --> 17:10.906
She seemed so sure.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.366
I was sure.

17:13.617 --> 17:14.785
I still am.

17:14.992 --> 17:15.993
Please, enough.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.121
No.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.289
What was it about him?

17:19.455 --> 17:20.958
I don't know.

17:22.459 --> 17:25.546
But we went for
coffee, and after,

17:26.797 --> 17:27.798
I kissed him.

17:30.134 --> 17:31.552
And it was
the strangest thing.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.679
It was like kissing myself.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.266
These two won't be
staying much longer.

17:38.016 --> 17:41.019
Unmarried people are so
delightfully easy to shock.

17:59.455 --> 18:00.581
Leave it.

18:04.793 --> 18:08.088
Were you really
corrupted by my ankles?

18:11.925 --> 18:13.886
You were shameless.

18:16.346 --> 18:17.723
I still am.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.426
Beautiful,

19:37.135 --> 19:38.595
shameless Gerda.

19:57.281 --> 19:58.448
Wait.

20:34.943 --> 20:36.278
Did I wake you?

20:38.405 --> 20:39.489
Sorry.

20:39.656 --> 20:41.158
I couldn't sleep.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.160
Why?

20:45.495 --> 20:46.997
Wondering about things.

20:47.831 --> 20:49.499
What things?

20:50.208 --> 20:53.086
Wondering if we made
a baby last night.

20:54.504 --> 20:56.006
What do you think?

20:57.466 --> 21:00.093
Wondering when
you got so pretty.

21:00.552 --> 21:02.179
I was always pretty.

21:03.180 --> 21:06.058
But you just
never noticed.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.477
Hello?
In here.

21:52.562 --> 21:54.189
These are good, Gerda.

21:57.192 --> 21:58.360
You think?
Mmm.

22:00.862 --> 22:02.155
Well, thank you.

22:02.322 --> 22:04.116
I had a coffee with Ulla.

22:04.241 --> 22:06.576
Hmm. She asked me
about the Artists' Ball.

22:06.660 --> 22:08.161
I'm not going.

22:08.245 --> 22:10.038
Don't worry.

22:10.872 --> 22:12.249
I told her no.

22:14.459 --> 22:17.129
You should go.
You enjoy it.

22:17.212 --> 22:18.964
With you, I enjoy it.

22:19.047 --> 22:20.382
It's good to be seen
at those things.

22:20.465 --> 22:21.633
I do understand that.

22:21.717 --> 22:22.926
And that's why
you hate them.

22:23.010 --> 22:25.345
I feel as though
I'm performing myself.

22:26.138 --> 22:28.849
Giving them
your Einar Wegener.

22:28.932 --> 22:29.933
Mmm-hmm.

22:34.646 --> 22:36.940
Why not give them
something different?

22:37.733 --> 22:39.401
Go as someone else?

22:41.361 --> 22:43.613
Do you have someone
in particular in mind?

22:47.993 --> 22:50.370
No.

22:50.454 --> 22:52.414
You'd be very convincing.

22:57.252 --> 22:58.545
That is outrageous.

22:58.628 --> 23:00.422
Oh, you might
even enjoy it.

23:00.589 --> 23:01.590
No.

23:10.348 --> 23:13.310
You'll have to shave
closer next time.

23:22.611 --> 23:25.322
Mmm? Mmm.

23:27.699 --> 23:29.159
Close your eyes.

23:29.326 --> 23:31.036
This is hard
on someone else.

23:31.119 --> 23:32.162
Well, let me try.

23:42.422 --> 23:43.715
What do you think?

23:44.925 --> 23:46.426
Better than I ever manage.

23:48.428 --> 23:49.471
Lili.

23:50.305 --> 23:52.099
I want to sketch you.

23:53.266 --> 23:54.976
Sit.

23:55.602 --> 23:58.105
Come on, Hvap.
Come on, you.

23:58.355 --> 23:59.523
Lean to the side.

24:00.023 --> 24:01.024
Knee over.

24:02.901 --> 24:04.820
Head up. Oh.

24:04.903 --> 24:07.656
Look at those hands.
Relax.

24:24.339 --> 24:25.549
Don't make her a slut!

24:25.632 --> 24:26.967
It's your fault.

24:28.343 --> 24:30.053
You excite her.

24:30.137 --> 24:31.388
My, Miss Lili.

24:32.597 --> 24:34.057
You are forward.

24:34.141 --> 24:35.684
You have no idea.

24:45.902 --> 24:47.988
Maybe bring out
the hand.

24:55.245 --> 24:56.288
Morning.

25:04.212 --> 25:05.213
Morning, Thorbjorn.

25:05.380 --> 25:06.506
Good morning.

25:18.143 --> 25:19.477
Forward.

26:05.482 --> 26:06.691
Hello?

26:08.610 --> 26:09.945
I was wondering
where you were.

26:11.780 --> 26:13.198
It's getting late.

26:14.449 --> 26:15.867
We have plenty of time.

26:16.826 --> 26:17.994
I bought you these.

26:18.119 --> 26:19.120
Ah.

26:23.166 --> 26:24.417
Oh, they're perfect.

26:27.921 --> 26:29.839
Are you sure
about tonight?

26:46.731 --> 26:47.899
What is it?

26:49.859 --> 26:51.236
Am I pretty enough?

26:52.487 --> 26:54.197
Of course you are.

26:57.826 --> 27:00.203
I'll never be
as pretty as you.

27:01.329 --> 27:02.664
You are so beautiful.

27:17.971 --> 27:19.055
My darling!

27:20.056 --> 27:23.101
Ulla, let me introduce...

27:24.936 --> 27:26.104
It's Lili.

27:27.564 --> 27:29.024
That's right.

27:29.190 --> 27:31.234
Einar's cousin from Vejle.

27:31.401 --> 27:32.986
My dear.

27:33.153 --> 27:34.654
You're exquisite!

27:36.698 --> 27:38.158
In, let's go in.

27:38.325 --> 27:39.367
Come on.

27:41.328 --> 27:43.413
You won't leave me,
will you?

27:45.540 --> 27:46.958
No, never.

28:00.930 --> 28:02.557
People are looking.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.643
Well, you're
a pretty girl.

28:06.478 --> 28:08.355
You'll have to
get used to it.

28:16.029 --> 28:17.280
It's fine.

28:18.365 --> 28:20.116
You're just feeling
self-conscious.

28:20.283 --> 28:21.659
Gerda?

28:21.785 --> 28:22.786
Oh...

28:24.662 --> 28:26.081
Go and talk to them.

28:26.247 --> 28:27.624
I'll stay with you.

28:27.791 --> 28:30.919
No, go, I'll be fine.
Please go before they come over.

28:31.419 --> 28:32.629
All right.

28:36.132 --> 28:37.342
Who's that?

29:30.353 --> 29:32.063
Are you a reporter?

29:34.983 --> 29:36.025
No.

29:36.901 --> 29:38.319
A poetess?

29:57.630 --> 29:59.716
Do you know the story
of this oak tree?

30:02.010 --> 30:03.011
No.

30:04.554 --> 30:08.224
They say that if you eat its
acorns, you can make a wish.

30:08.933 --> 30:11.394
And become anyone
you want for a day.

30:15.064 --> 30:16.858
Why would they say that?

30:20.320 --> 30:21.821
Henrik Sandahl.

30:22.322 --> 30:23.907
At your disposal.

30:24.449 --> 30:25.575
Lili.

30:28.286 --> 30:30.079
Are you here
with someone, Lili?

30:31.331 --> 30:32.874
Yes, my, uh...

30:33.041 --> 30:34.918
My cousin's wife.

30:36.753 --> 30:37.962
Who's your cousin?

30:39.547 --> 30:41.758
Einar Wegener. Painter.

30:42.842 --> 30:45.011
Yes, he's rather
a good one.

30:46.596 --> 30:48.598
He's better than
most people think.

30:49.807 --> 30:50.850
Is that right?

30:51.059 --> 30:53.102
Most people our age,
at any rate.

30:59.192 --> 31:03.154
Don't go back in there.
It's, um... It's cooler out here.

31:05.073 --> 31:06.866
Besides, I'm a romantic.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.243
Really?

31:09.285 --> 31:10.495
I prefer the shadows.

31:11.204 --> 31:13.665
And I don't mean
to presume,

31:14.415 --> 31:16.167
but I've been
watching you.

31:18.503 --> 31:20.004
And I think
you might be the same.

31:27.679 --> 31:28.805
Come on.

31:38.731 --> 31:40.817
Have you seen Einar?
I can't find him.

31:40.984 --> 31:43.403
Of course you can't.
He isn't here.

31:46.906 --> 31:48.032
Cheers.

31:51.619 --> 31:53.246
You're different
from most girls.

31:57.625 --> 31:59.210
That's not a very
original line.

31:59.377 --> 32:00.461
It's true.

32:03.172 --> 32:05.049
You're old-fashioned.

32:05.216 --> 32:06.509
Provincial.

32:08.886 --> 32:10.638
I'm new to the city.

32:10.805 --> 32:12.432
No, it's more than that.

32:14.601 --> 32:17.979
I feel I'd need to ask
your permission before I kissed you.

32:24.777 --> 32:26.154
I should go
and find Gerda.

32:30.241 --> 32:32.327
Why don't you tell her
I'll walk you home?

32:34.495 --> 32:36.122
No, she wouldn't like that.

32:36.998 --> 32:39.375
Lili... No, Einar...

32:40.710 --> 32:43.713
He might be waiting for us,
and he wouldn't like this.

32:44.505 --> 32:46.174
Wouldn't he?

32:47.383 --> 32:48.468
No.

32:52.263 --> 32:53.556
Lili...

32:55.892 --> 32:57.185
Lili...

33:02.273 --> 33:03.524
Lili...

33:25.046 --> 33:27.090
You didn't ask permission.

33:27.256 --> 33:29.676
I couldn't risk
you saying no.

33:36.349 --> 33:37.517
What's the matter?

33:38.810 --> 33:39.936
I'm sorry.

33:50.071 --> 33:52.198
I'm sorry,
I don't know what happened.

34:22.770 --> 34:24.272
How are you?

34:30.402 --> 34:32.842
You were late home last night,
so I thought I'd let you sleep.

34:34.949 --> 34:36.242
How was it?

34:37.784 --> 34:39.495
Did Lili have fun?

34:57.597 --> 35:01.100
I think it would be better if
Lili didn't come here again.

35:04.771 --> 35:05.897
Fine.

35:06.564 --> 35:09.066
Exactly what happened between
you and Sandahl last night?

35:09.233 --> 35:10.818
Nothing.

35:10.985 --> 35:11.986
It was nothing.

35:12.153 --> 35:13.946
Did he know it was you?

35:14.280 --> 35:15.364
It wasn't
as simple as that.

35:15.531 --> 35:17.742
I watched him
kiss you, Einar,

35:17.825 --> 35:19.786
so could you
please make an effort?

35:22.705 --> 35:26.626
He may have known who I was,
but I wasn't always me.

35:27.210 --> 35:29.879
There was a moment
when I was just Lili,

35:30.046 --> 35:32.423
and I think that
he could see that.

35:33.549 --> 35:36.219
Do you see?
But Lili doesn't exist.

35:39.889 --> 35:40.890
We made her up.

35:40.973 --> 35:41.974
I know.

35:42.141 --> 35:45.019
We were playing a game.
I know we were.

35:46.354 --> 35:47.647
But then,

35:50.817 --> 35:51.943
something changed.

35:52.109 --> 35:54.946
This is absurd. We...
We need to stop.

35:55.905 --> 35:57.824
You need to stop, Einar.

35:59.492 --> 36:00.701
I am going to try.

36:27.186 --> 36:28.396
Another headache?

36:30.273 --> 36:31.482
It's nothing.

36:35.778 --> 36:36.988
Can I get you anything?

36:39.031 --> 36:40.408
I'm fine.

36:50.668 --> 36:52.545
Maybe you should
see a doctor.

36:52.837 --> 36:53.838
Gerda...

36:54.797 --> 36:55.798
I'm fine.

40:11.243 --> 40:12.411
I didn't think
you'd come.

40:15.539 --> 40:16.749
No.

40:18.125 --> 40:19.335
Nor did I.

40:35.518 --> 40:37.520
I thought you might
not come back.

40:39.271 --> 40:40.356
That's absurd.

40:41.190 --> 40:42.191
Is it?

40:49.990 --> 40:51.200
Come here.

41:18.477 --> 41:19.812
The model...

41:22.773 --> 41:24.817
Einar's cousin.

41:30.406 --> 41:32.449
The resemblance is...

41:38.873 --> 41:40.040
Are there others?

41:40.207 --> 41:42.418
A series
back at the studio.

41:45.588 --> 41:47.131
These are different.

41:48.465 --> 41:49.675
For these...

41:50.259 --> 41:52.011
I don't know,
there may be a market.

41:52.678 --> 41:53.929
You're taking them?

41:54.096 --> 41:55.431
Well, yes.

42:10.613 --> 42:11.655
Come in.

42:18.329 --> 42:19.747
I haven't got long.

42:20.581 --> 42:22.625
Gerda's seeing Rasmussen.

42:24.585 --> 42:26.921
I don't like
all these lies.

42:29.173 --> 42:30.382
She's very protective.

42:30.549 --> 42:32.551
Why don't you just
tell her about us?

42:32.718 --> 42:34.345
I couldn't do that.

42:43.354 --> 42:44.563
Sorry.

42:45.731 --> 42:47.274
I don't want to upset you.

42:52.488 --> 42:53.989
Come here.

43:01.872 --> 43:03.832
No.
Yes.

43:10.798 --> 43:11.799
Einar.

43:15.261 --> 43:16.262
What?

43:16.428 --> 43:18.347
Come on. Shh.
It's all right.

43:21.308 --> 43:23.060
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

43:26.188 --> 43:28.274
I... Lili.

43:28.440 --> 43:29.483
Please.

43:31.235 --> 43:32.861
I don't know
what you want.

43:34.446 --> 43:36.448
I want you.
I don't know what you mean.

43:37.950 --> 43:40.244
I want you.
No!

43:40.619 --> 43:42.871
Lili. Lili.
Lili, wait!

44:46.060 --> 44:47.978
Are you all right?

44:49.438 --> 44:51.190
No.

45:00.824 --> 45:03.327
I've been seeing
Henrik Sandahl.

45:16.590 --> 45:18.342
I'm...

45:45.536 --> 45:47.454
I thought
perhaps you knew.

45:47.621 --> 45:48.997
No.

45:49.373 --> 45:50.958
Not this.

45:53.252 --> 45:54.294
So...

45:56.713 --> 45:58.549
Are you in love
with Sandahl?

45:59.299 --> 46:00.634
No.

46:02.261 --> 46:04.680
No, I love you.

46:05.139 --> 46:08.392
Gerda, only you.
It's Lili, she...

46:09.101 --> 46:10.144
Be honest.

46:10.310 --> 46:12.563
I need you
to believe me, Gerda.

46:12.646 --> 46:14.231
You of all people
to understand.

46:14.398 --> 46:17.985
All right. You need to
tell me when Henrik and

46:18.152 --> 46:19.361
Lili

46:19.945 --> 46:21.655
are together, they what?
They...

46:22.573 --> 46:23.907
They kiss?

46:26.869 --> 46:28.996
Has it gone beyond that?
No.

46:30.873 --> 46:32.958
No, Lili has never gone
further than that with a man.

46:33.041 --> 46:34.126
She wouldn't. She's...

46:34.293 --> 46:35.794
There have been
other men?

46:35.919 --> 46:37.045
Wait, there...

46:37.171 --> 46:41.216
There was another, yes,
but it was a long time ago.

46:42.718 --> 46:45.304
It was that boy, Hans.

46:45.721 --> 46:47.598
In Vejle.

46:47.764 --> 46:50.267
She fell for him, and

46:51.435 --> 46:53.687
he kissed her.
Just once.

46:56.023 --> 46:59.234
But then my father came in
and he caught them.

47:00.527 --> 47:02.779
And he smacked Hans down.

47:03.780 --> 47:05.282
He was so angry.

47:07.034 --> 47:08.535
I don't know
what to say.

47:14.208 --> 47:15.250
What?

47:16.335 --> 47:17.961
I'm so...

47:18.128 --> 47:19.546
Einar?

47:19.671 --> 47:20.923
I'm so sorry.

47:22.299 --> 47:24.176
I'm so sorry, I'm not feeling well.
Einar, what is it?

47:24.343 --> 47:25.802
Einar, Einar, Einar!

47:25.969 --> 47:29.681
Einar. What's happened? What's happening?
I'm all right. I'm all right.

47:29.848 --> 47:31.892
What?
Do you have pain?

47:50.744 --> 47:55.999
So, you saw Doctor Andersen after
a bout of severe nosebleeds,

47:56.083 --> 47:59.002
which you have
come to believe

47:59.169 --> 48:02.464
coincide with the stomach cramps,
and on a

48:02.631 --> 48:04.341
monthly basis.

48:04.800 --> 48:05.801
Hmm.

48:07.135 --> 48:08.136
So.

48:08.720 --> 48:09.972
How long have
you been married?

48:10.681 --> 48:11.765
Six years.

48:11.932 --> 48:12.933
Children?

48:13.141 --> 48:14.142
No.

48:14.893 --> 48:16.520
Is there
regular copulation?

48:18.480 --> 48:19.481
Yes.

48:22.401 --> 48:24.194
Perhaps less now
than before...

48:24.361 --> 48:26.081
Than before you started
to dress as a woman?

48:27.364 --> 48:30.284
I'm a specialist, Mr. Wegener.
You may be embarrassed.

48:30.450 --> 48:31.952
I am not.

48:32.244 --> 48:35.247
Tell me about Lili.

48:35.872 --> 48:36.957
Where does she come from?

48:37.791 --> 48:39.084
Inside me.

48:42.671 --> 48:48.218
You know, the most likely explanation for
all of this is a chemical imbalance.

48:49.094 --> 48:50.262
Really?
Mmm.

48:51.221 --> 48:52.306
Onto the bed.

48:53.515 --> 48:55.517
That would
explain the pain,

48:55.684 --> 48:59.646
the confused state of masculinity
and the infertility.

48:59.813 --> 49:02.232
Let's hope it is that, because that,
at least, we can cure.

49:06.987 --> 49:08.488
I don't need
to do this.

49:08.655 --> 49:09.990
There's nothing
wrong with me.

49:10.073 --> 49:12.075
That's not true.
Gerda, this can't be right.

49:12.242 --> 49:14.786
Radiation is a miracle,
Mr. Wegener.

49:14.953 --> 49:17.956
It destroys the bad
and saves the good.

49:18.999 --> 49:20.542
I'm sure it'll be
over quickly.

49:32.721 --> 49:34.556
Lie still,
Mr. Wegener.

50:03.627 --> 50:04.878
Mr. Wegener?

50:05.879 --> 50:07.714
How are you feeling
this morning?

50:10.258 --> 50:12.511
You hurt Lili.

50:15.555 --> 50:18.934
I'm afraid your husband's
aberrant thinking persists.

50:21.395 --> 50:23.522
Do you keep a lock
on your wardrobe?

50:23.689 --> 50:24.690
Of course not.

50:24.773 --> 50:27.442
Mrs. Wegener, you're not
encouraging this delusion?

50:29.027 --> 50:30.904
You do understand that
your husband is insane?

50:30.987 --> 50:32.072
No.

50:33.115 --> 50:34.449
That's not true.

50:34.533 --> 50:35.909
We trusted you.

50:35.992 --> 50:37.536
We came to you for help.

51:02.436 --> 51:03.937
<i>Gerda!</i>

51:04.896 --> 51:06.565
Where have you been?

51:06.648 --> 51:08.483
Away.

51:08.567 --> 51:10.736
Why? What's wrong?

51:10.819 --> 51:12.988
I sold the Lili portraits.

51:13.071 --> 51:16.867
I have enough interest, now,
to mount a full show.

51:16.950 --> 51:19.953
That's wonderful.
And there's more.

51:23.290 --> 51:28.712
The Gallery Etienne Dufour in
Paris wants to represent you.

51:30.130 --> 51:32.382
In Paris?
Yes, you must go.

51:35.802 --> 51:37.220
I can't travel just now.

51:38.263 --> 51:39.598
Gerda,

51:39.681 --> 51:41.057
this is your moment.

51:41.141 --> 51:42.976
You've waited
long enough.

51:43.059 --> 51:44.436
These art dealers
can be fickle.

51:50.358 --> 51:51.359
Oh!

52:16.510 --> 52:17.719
What are you doing?

52:18.136 --> 52:19.763
I've been asked
to exhibit in Paris.

52:20.305 --> 52:21.681
That's wonderful.

52:21.807 --> 52:23.099
Yes.

52:23.183 --> 52:25.060
We have to go.

52:25.143 --> 52:26.895
Rasmussen said it would
make all the difference.

52:26.978 --> 52:29.356
Gerda, I'm not sure
that I can.

52:30.065 --> 52:31.233
I'll take care of you.

52:31.316 --> 52:33.109
Yes, but surely
there's no rush.

52:33.276 --> 52:35.237
Can't you just do
this one thing for me?

52:37.155 --> 52:38.740
What's happening?

52:40.700 --> 52:41.952
I had a letter from Hexler.

52:43.411 --> 52:44.830
He wants to lock me up.

52:47.582 --> 52:50.001
Everything will
work out for us.

52:51.294 --> 52:53.296
Really. I know it.

52:56.174 --> 52:58.134
You just have to trust me.

53:00.720 --> 53:02.013
I do.

53:25.829 --> 53:27.581
Einar's a painter, too.

53:27.706 --> 53:30.667
Oh. Do you
exhibit in Paris?

53:31.042 --> 53:34.796
I think my work's a little
introspective for French taste.

53:34.963 --> 53:37.966
Excuse me.
Is the model here?

53:38.508 --> 53:39.509
No.

53:40.427 --> 53:41.547
She stayed behind
in Denmark.

53:41.636 --> 53:44.723
Oh, I was so hoping
to meet her.

53:46.892 --> 53:48.351
Madame Gerda Wegener...

54:07.662 --> 54:09.247
No.

54:13.251 --> 54:14.878
I'm sorry.

54:32.771 --> 54:34.022
Will you sit for me?

54:37.067 --> 54:38.068
Just as you are.

54:39.778 --> 54:41.780
We haven't done that
since art school.

54:43.615 --> 54:45.075
The teacher,

54:45.742 --> 54:48.203
suddenly at the mercy
of the student.

54:48.370 --> 54:49.996
You found it exciting.

54:52.123 --> 54:53.750
I can't just now.

54:55.293 --> 54:56.711
I'm sorry.

54:58.254 --> 54:59.714
I miss you.

55:01.424 --> 55:03.009
I miss you
working beside me.

55:05.595 --> 55:08.014
I can't remember
the landscape anymore.

55:10.392 --> 55:13.019
I can't remember Vejle.

55:15.772 --> 55:18.191
Well, you can help me
with this background.

55:19.734 --> 55:21.277
What does it need?

55:21.528 --> 55:22.904
A kettle-hole lake?

55:23.947 --> 55:26.241
A farmhouse? Far off?

55:26.408 --> 55:27.826
Gerda.

56:09.325 --> 56:10.535
<i>Merci.</i>

58:06.526 --> 58:08.611
Well, he's
playing with us.

58:08.778 --> 58:10.613
He knows the price.

58:10.780 --> 58:13.658
Look, I have to go, I have some
Danish girl waiting to see me.

58:14.242 --> 58:15.243
All right.

58:15.410 --> 58:16.411
Madame.

58:25.044 --> 58:26.254
Hans Axgil.

58:27.422 --> 58:28.590
Hello.

58:28.715 --> 58:29.716
Thank you for seeing me.

58:29.924 --> 58:32.010
Don't thank me yet,
I can't represent you.

58:32.177 --> 58:33.595
I don't handle
any contemporary art.

58:33.720 --> 58:35.847
Of course.
I know that.

58:36.014 --> 58:38.892
The reviews for your show
were terrific, but...

58:39.058 --> 58:42.770
Perhaps if you would let me speak,
things would be clearer.

58:43.104 --> 58:45.106
So, when did you arrive?

58:45.273 --> 58:47.025
Six months, almost.

58:48.610 --> 58:50.612
I don't know why Rasmussen
gave you my number,

58:50.695 --> 58:52.155
but I'm happy he did.

58:53.239 --> 58:54.949
I asked him.

58:55.116 --> 58:58.119
I wanted to meet you
to put a face to a name.

58:58.620 --> 58:59.621
Hmm.

58:59.913 --> 59:02.832
I believe you were a childhood
friend of my husband.

59:04.709 --> 59:06.127
You have a husband?

59:10.381 --> 59:12.300
I'm married
to Einar Wegener.

59:12.759 --> 59:13.760
Einar?

59:13.927 --> 59:15.011
You remember him?

59:15.178 --> 59:16.930
Of course
I remember him.

59:17.096 --> 59:18.765
We were such friends.
How is he?

59:19.766 --> 59:21.309
He told me that
you kissed him once.

59:21.476 --> 59:22.894
I what?

59:26.522 --> 59:27.732
You're right.

59:28.024 --> 59:29.984
You're right,
I remember.

59:30.485 --> 59:31.861
We were fooling
in the kitchen,

59:31.945 --> 59:34.197
and he was wearing
his grandmother's apron.

59:34.280 --> 59:37.325
You know, little boys,
playing around.

59:37.492 --> 59:39.953
He just looked so pretty in it.
I had to kiss him!

59:40.119 --> 59:42.664
So, yes,
I kissed Einar.

59:43.873 --> 59:45.917
The next thing I know,
his father's chasing me out.

59:49.504 --> 59:50.797
Einar, my God.

59:51.464 --> 59:53.091
Why didn't he come today?

59:53.508 --> 59:55.468
He doesn't know I'm here.

59:55.635 --> 59:57.929
I don't think he'd like me
asking for help.

01:00:00.139 --> 01:00:03.518
We don't really know people here.
And Einar is... He's...

01:00:04.811 --> 01:00:06.312
He's lost his way.

01:00:06.479 --> 01:00:08.147
He's not working.

01:00:08.314 --> 01:00:11.651
He needs someone to represent him,
someone who knows him.

01:00:14.696 --> 01:00:16.281
He needs a friend.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:31.713
<i>I have a new dealer
coming over later.</i>

01:00:32.463 --> 01:00:33.923
I'd like you to meet him.

01:00:35.591 --> 01:00:37.802
I don't want
a new dealer.

01:00:37.969 --> 01:00:40.388
It doesn't make sense to me.
I'm hardly working.

01:00:40.888 --> 01:00:42.515
That might change.

01:00:43.474 --> 01:00:44.934
I don't think so.

01:00:45.101 --> 01:00:46.894
I'm happy helping you.

01:00:48.104 --> 01:00:49.480
It's Hans Axgil.

01:00:51.441 --> 01:00:52.984
Dinner at La Dauphine
at 8:00,

01:00:53.067 --> 01:00:55.111
then back here
to see the paintings.

01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:58.740
He remembers you
with great fondness.

01:01:11.502 --> 01:01:12.503
It was handmade,

01:01:12.587 --> 01:01:13.588
and I've had it
since I was four.

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:16.966
You know, Einar's still stricken
with guilt about crashing your kite.

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:19.093
My kite?
I'll tease him about that.

01:01:19.761 --> 01:01:22.430
No, it's too cruel.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:25.141
Well, if he ever gets here.
Perhaps he doesn't want to see me.

01:01:25.516 --> 01:01:26.684
No.

01:01:27.477 --> 01:01:28.686
No, it's not that.

01:01:31.564 --> 01:01:33.191
Maybe we should
order without him.

01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:35.693
Does he abandon you often?

01:01:37.528 --> 01:01:38.946
Of course not.

01:01:40.114 --> 01:01:41.115
I was joking.

01:01:48.373 --> 01:01:49.540
I can come back
another time,

01:01:49.624 --> 01:01:51.334
if you think Einar
would prefer it.

01:01:52.752 --> 01:01:53.795
Really.

01:01:53.961 --> 01:01:55.421
He's expecting you.

01:01:56.005 --> 01:01:58.007
And it'll do him good.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.138
I know this.

01:02:05.515 --> 01:02:06.641
The fjord at Vejle,

01:02:06.724 --> 01:02:08.142
not far from our houses.

01:02:08.351 --> 01:02:10.686
Yes, he painted it
just before we left.

01:02:13.064 --> 01:02:14.065
Lili.

01:02:16.609 --> 01:02:17.652
Hans.

01:02:19.028 --> 01:02:20.905
May I introduce

01:02:21.072 --> 01:02:22.490
Lili Wegener.

01:02:23.157 --> 01:02:25.201
Einar's cousin from home.

01:02:28.538 --> 01:02:30.998
You cannot imagine
how happy I am.

01:02:33.626 --> 01:02:37.255
We actually met
once before, in Vejle,

01:02:37.338 --> 01:02:39.006
but you probably
don't remember.

01:02:42.885 --> 01:02:44.095
May I take your coat?

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.721
Of course.

01:02:48.015 --> 01:02:49.642
A <i>digestif,</i> Hans?

01:02:54.564 --> 01:02:55.898
It's so chilly
all of a sudden.

01:02:57.859 --> 01:02:59.902
I feel the cold these days.
I don't know why.

01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:01.279
Here.

01:03:02.238 --> 01:03:03.448
Thank you.

01:03:07.827 --> 01:03:09.996
I'm so sorry that Einar
couldn't be here.

01:03:10.663 --> 01:03:12.832
He told me how,
back in Vejle,

01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:15.126
you were his
great friend.

01:03:16.294 --> 01:03:18.838
Both always plotting to get away.
That's true.

01:03:19.005 --> 01:03:22.008
Such a tedious place!

01:03:23.468 --> 01:03:26.053
He said that you would
sit and you'd

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:27.722
look out together,

01:03:27.889 --> 01:03:30.099
beyond the fjord,
to the sea.

01:03:31.225 --> 01:03:32.685
To the future.

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:34.687
We had big dreams, yes.

01:03:36.022 --> 01:03:37.190
Yes.

01:03:39.066 --> 01:03:42.069
And that you were the only one
that would let him paint in peace.

01:03:43.154 --> 01:03:45.406
Who told him it was all
right to be a painter.

01:03:45.573 --> 01:03:47.241
He used to
sketch my portrait.

01:03:48.075 --> 01:03:51.162
Take a stone and draw me on the
rocks at the side of the road.

01:03:54.248 --> 01:03:55.541
I didn't know that.

01:03:55.708 --> 01:03:57.084
Yes.

01:04:00.087 --> 01:04:01.589
Would you like to see
more of Einar's work?

01:04:01.756 --> 01:04:03.049
Yes.
But do we have any?

01:04:03.591 --> 01:04:04.967
Of course, Lili.

01:04:05.134 --> 01:04:06.844
Could we not do it another time?
Because I just...

01:04:07.011 --> 01:04:08.763
I want to hear
more about you, Hans.

01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:09.931
Are you married?

01:04:10.139 --> 01:04:11.933
Uh, no.
Well, why not?

01:04:14.977 --> 01:04:16.395
You don't mind, do you?

01:04:16.854 --> 01:04:20.024
I've been on my own a long time now.
I'm too set in my ways.

01:04:22.902 --> 01:04:24.654
I think that marriage is
the single thing

01:04:24.737 --> 01:04:26.364
we should all
hope for in life.

01:04:26.948 --> 01:04:28.032
Really?

01:04:29.116 --> 01:04:31.536
It creates someone else.

01:04:32.745 --> 01:04:34.914
More than just
the two of you.

01:04:37.625 --> 01:04:39.752
Yes, I think
it'd be terrible not to...

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:44.131
I think it'd be terrible...
I'm so...

01:04:44.298 --> 01:04:46.259
Will you excuse me?

01:04:46.759 --> 01:04:47.760
Lili.

01:05:01.857 --> 01:05:03.234
You ought to go.

01:05:04.193 --> 01:05:05.278
Let me help.

01:05:08.281 --> 01:05:09.657
Please.

01:05:15.288 --> 01:05:16.664
I'm sorry.

01:05:21.002 --> 01:05:22.378
Good night, Lili.

01:05:23.796 --> 01:05:25.131
Good night.

01:05:34.599 --> 01:05:36.809
I don't think he noticed,
do you?

01:05:38.519 --> 01:05:39.854
I don't know.

01:05:41.439 --> 01:05:43.524
I think I got out
just in time.

01:05:46.152 --> 01:05:47.361
Sleep now.

01:05:48.487 --> 01:05:49.989
We'll talk more tomorrow.

01:05:52.116 --> 01:05:54.327
Can I borrow a nightdress?

01:06:00.458 --> 01:06:02.168
No, we've never done that.

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.505
Lili's never
spent the night.

01:06:08.132 --> 01:06:10.134
It doesn't matter
what I wear.

01:06:14.513 --> 01:06:16.140
'Cause when I dream,

01:06:18.017 --> 01:06:20.019
they're Lili's dreams.

01:06:51.509 --> 01:06:52.927
What?

01:06:59.975 --> 01:07:01.060
A new dress.

01:07:01.227 --> 01:07:02.645
And this is for you.

01:07:04.188 --> 01:07:05.523
Do you like it?

01:07:06.065 --> 01:07:07.066
Yes.

01:07:11.404 --> 01:07:13.155
It's perfect for you.

01:07:13.322 --> 01:07:15.042
We're a little short
of money at the moment.

01:07:15.116 --> 01:07:16.367
I know.

01:07:16.534 --> 01:07:18.374
But now that I'm back,
I can sit for you again.

01:07:20.246 --> 01:07:22.415
Well, it worked well before.

01:07:22.581 --> 01:07:23.582
Didn't it work?

01:07:26.627 --> 01:07:27.628
Come on.

01:07:28.003 --> 01:07:29.004
Come on, Hvap.

01:07:34.677 --> 01:07:36.262
Looks good.

01:07:36.804 --> 01:07:37.888
Head up.

01:07:38.305 --> 01:07:39.390
Up. There.

01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:41.225
No, back.
Yes. Okay.

01:07:49.692 --> 01:07:51.652
Is that good?
Ring, up.

01:07:57.908 --> 01:07:59.326
Thank you.

01:08:22.349 --> 01:08:24.059
I didn't know
you were coming.

01:08:24.602 --> 01:08:25.853
It's a good crowd.

01:08:26.187 --> 01:08:27.729
She's a popular girl.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:31.066
Thank you for coming.

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:35.613
Thank you for inviting me.
I thought you'd forgotten all about me.

01:08:35.696 --> 01:08:36.863
We've been busy.

01:08:38.657 --> 01:08:39.908
Is Einar here?

01:08:41.952 --> 01:08:43.287
He hates
this kind of thing.

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:44.662
That's a shame.

01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:46.247
For you, I mean.

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:48.667
I don't mind.

01:08:48.751 --> 01:08:49.877
Is he well?

01:08:50.711 --> 01:08:51.837
He's excited.

01:08:52.796 --> 01:08:54.506
Our friend, uh,
is coming to town,

01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:56.430
Ulla Fonsmarck, the dancer.
You maybe know her?

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:58.551
No, I don't think so.

01:09:01.346 --> 01:09:02.680
Can I take you to dinner?

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.350
To celebrate?

01:09:05.518 --> 01:09:07.228
I think someone ought to.

01:09:08.437 --> 01:09:10.481
No. Thank you.

01:09:10.939 --> 01:09:11.941
Gerda.

01:09:13.651 --> 01:09:15.319
Have I offended you?

01:09:17.446 --> 01:09:18.488
No.

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:19.990
Gerda.

01:09:22.117 --> 01:09:23.577
I'm still Einar's wife.

01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:31.710
Hans!

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.255
Oh, Henri!

01:09:51.438 --> 01:09:53.774
At least take an umbrella.

01:09:53.858 --> 01:09:56.443
Oh. No, I'm fine,
honestly.

01:09:56.527 --> 01:09:58.863
Well, if you just wait a minute,
someone will drive you.

01:09:58.946 --> 01:10:00.489
No, I'm fine.

01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:25.014
My goodness,
you're soaked.

01:10:27.683 --> 01:10:28.934
Did it go well?

01:10:29.935 --> 01:10:31.020
Tell me, how was it?

01:10:33.022 --> 01:10:34.982
You'd know
if you'd been there.

01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:39.153
I've made us a supper.

01:10:39.278 --> 01:10:40.738
You should have come.

01:10:40.821 --> 01:10:42.531
A little sort of
celebration.

01:10:43.032 --> 01:10:44.992
This is not how it goes.

01:10:48.037 --> 01:10:49.955
We do these
things together.

01:10:51.707 --> 01:10:53.918
That was you and Einar.

01:10:54.001 --> 01:10:56.670
Stop playing that stupid,
stupid game.

01:10:56.837 --> 01:10:58.339
Please, Gerda.

01:11:00.257 --> 01:11:02.259
Don't you think
this is a game.

01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:05.763
You should have been there!

01:11:06.138 --> 01:11:07.640
How could I?

01:11:10.017 --> 01:11:13.020
Look at me.
Not everything is about you.

01:11:22.446 --> 01:11:23.572
I need to see Einar.

01:11:24.198 --> 01:11:25.866
Let me help, please.

01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:27.368
I need my husband.

01:11:28.869 --> 01:11:30.287
Go get him.

01:11:33.457 --> 01:11:34.917
I can't.

01:11:35.167 --> 01:11:38.921
I need to talk to my husband.
I need to hold my husband.

01:11:41.048 --> 01:11:42.424
I need him.

01:11:43.509 --> 01:11:45.427
Can't you just get him?

01:11:49.682 --> 01:11:51.475
Can you at least try?

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.065
No. I'm sorry.

01:12:31.056 --> 01:12:32.057
Gerda.

01:12:33.934 --> 01:12:34.935
What is it?

01:12:47.114 --> 01:12:48.782
Are you all right?

01:13:08.635 --> 01:13:09.845
Oh, my God.

01:13:14.266 --> 01:13:15.267
Gerda, wait.

01:13:15.976 --> 01:13:17.186
Wait!

01:13:49.218 --> 01:13:51.512
I don't think I can

01:13:51.678 --> 01:13:53.263
give you what you want.

01:14:08.529 --> 01:14:11.240
I don't know how long
we can go on like this.

01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:17.538
No.

01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:29.967
He needs to see someone.

01:14:30.092 --> 01:14:31.718
You know what happened
with Hexler.

01:14:31.969 --> 01:14:33.137
But he's so thin.

01:14:34.930 --> 01:14:36.515
Something's wrong with him.

01:14:37.808 --> 01:14:40.477
Lili
watches her figure.

01:14:41.395 --> 01:14:42.980
Look.

01:14:43.063 --> 01:14:44.648
There's a doctor.

01:14:44.731 --> 01:14:46.984
He runs the Women's Clinic
in Dresden.

01:14:47.067 --> 01:14:49.194
He's interested
in men like Einar

01:14:50.404 --> 01:14:51.572
who are

01:14:52.114 --> 01:14:53.115
confused.

01:14:55.075 --> 01:14:56.785
Men who are different.

01:14:58.412 --> 01:14:59.997
He's often in Paris.

01:15:00.164 --> 01:15:01.582
Just talk to him.

01:15:09.756 --> 01:15:11.300
You're awake.

01:15:11.842 --> 01:15:13.010
How do you feel?

01:15:15.679 --> 01:15:16.763
Come.

01:15:17.264 --> 01:15:18.765
Listen, I've got
somewhere to go.

01:15:19.016 --> 01:15:20.017
Where?

01:15:23.604 --> 01:15:24.813
Sorry, I...

01:15:27.274 --> 01:15:29.359
I don't know how to hold
on to you any longer.

01:15:33.614 --> 01:15:34.823
I know.

01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:38.327
But I love you,

01:15:39.703 --> 01:15:41.747
and I'm going
to find an answer.

01:16:32.756 --> 01:16:34.424
English?
English.

01:16:34.508 --> 01:16:36.009
Do you speak English?

01:16:36.385 --> 01:16:38.512
Are you, um,
a boy or a girl?

01:16:38.679 --> 01:16:40.264
A woman?
Do you have a...

01:16:41.515 --> 01:16:42.516
Or...

01:16:47.187 --> 01:16:48.188
Joking.

01:17:32.607 --> 01:17:34.776
I can't hold the buyers
much longer, I'm sorry.

01:17:42.242 --> 01:17:43.410
Einar?

01:17:45.412 --> 01:17:46.830
You're good at this.

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.458
I boxed for a while.

01:17:51.376 --> 01:17:53.211
Shame you weren't
with me earlier.

01:18:00.594 --> 01:18:02.512
I'm sorry I've not been
to see you before.

01:18:02.721 --> 01:18:03.930
That's all right.

01:18:05.182 --> 01:18:06.600
You're here now.

01:18:08.185 --> 01:18:10.395
I couldn't let Gerda
see me like this.

01:18:11.563 --> 01:18:13.190
She's had enough
to put up with.

01:18:13.565 --> 01:18:14.983
What's happened to you?

01:18:17.736 --> 01:18:19.071
I don't understand.

01:18:21.448 --> 01:18:22.616
Nor do I.

01:18:26.453 --> 01:18:28.497
But I don't think
it's anything new.

01:18:30.457 --> 01:18:31.917
Even back in Vejle...

01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:34.252
What?
Ow. Sorry.

01:18:39.341 --> 01:18:40.467
What?

01:18:41.927 --> 01:18:43.303
I was different.

01:18:45.347 --> 01:18:48.058
It didn't take much
to be different in Vejle.

01:18:48.266 --> 01:18:50.310
Surely that's why
we became friends.

01:18:53.647 --> 01:18:54.856
Every morning

01:18:55.982 --> 01:19:00.028
I promise myself that I will
spend the entire day as Einar.

01:19:01.738 --> 01:19:04.074
But there's
so little of Einar left.

01:19:04.699 --> 01:19:06.868
You think these things
because you're exhausted.

01:19:10.956 --> 01:19:13.959
Sometimes I think
about killing Einar.

01:19:15.502 --> 01:19:20.132
But it's only the thought that I'd
be killing Lili too that stops me.

01:19:21.508 --> 01:19:22.926
You need to see someone.

01:19:23.927 --> 01:19:25.929
A doctor.
No.

01:19:26.012 --> 01:19:27.431
Yes.
No doctors.

01:19:27.597 --> 01:19:29.182
I'll help you
find someone.

01:19:30.642 --> 01:19:32.394
You have to try.

01:19:35.021 --> 01:19:38.108
<i>A confused
state of identity.</i>

01:19:38.358 --> 01:19:41.987
I drill small holes,

01:19:42.612 --> 01:19:44.656
here and here.

01:19:45.574 --> 01:19:47.409
I have listened to you
very carefully,

01:19:47.534 --> 01:19:50.287
and I'm afraid
it's not good news.

01:19:50.370 --> 01:19:52.205
You're a homosexual.

01:19:54.332 --> 01:19:57.544
Well, I don't really know what
kind of help I need, but I...

01:19:58.879 --> 01:20:02.340
I can't go on living
without knowing who I am.

01:20:02.424 --> 01:20:03.624
Please excuse me for a moment.

01:20:59.689 --> 01:21:01.525
Do you think
I'm insane?

01:21:06.988 --> 01:21:08.406
Did a doctor say that?

01:21:08.865 --> 01:21:11.618
I'm sorry.
I know we agreed no more, but...

01:21:14.287 --> 01:21:15.372
Look at me.

01:21:15.455 --> 01:21:17.457
You are not insane.

01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:23.922
Did I do this to you?

01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:26.758
What?

01:21:30.804 --> 01:21:33.807
Sometimes, I...
I wonder...

01:21:34.432 --> 01:21:36.059
If it hadn't been
for the paintings...

01:21:36.142 --> 01:21:37.811
No. Gerda, no.

01:21:39.771 --> 01:21:43.650
You helped bring Lili to life,
but she was always there.

01:21:45.068 --> 01:21:46.111
She was always waiting.

01:21:46.570 --> 01:21:48.321
Now she's making you ill.

01:21:50.574 --> 01:21:52.200
I don't know what to do.

01:21:56.538 --> 01:21:58.540
The doctors can't help me.

01:22:04.004 --> 01:22:05.880
Do you want
to try one more?

01:22:16.266 --> 01:22:18.518
...Warnekros, Einar.
My husband.

01:22:18.602 --> 01:22:20.228
Hello.
Good to see you.

01:22:21.563 --> 01:22:23.189
So, what do you think
would explain

01:22:23.273 --> 01:22:25.400
what you've been experiencing,
Mr. Wegener?

01:22:26.026 --> 01:22:28.194
Professor Warnekros,
the fact is

01:22:31.197 --> 01:22:33.033
I believe that
I am a woman,

01:22:35.118 --> 01:22:36.328
inside.

01:22:38.371 --> 01:22:39.998
And I believe it too.

01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:49.716
You probably think
that I'm insane.

01:22:50.884 --> 01:22:53.011
Or that we both are.

01:22:53.386 --> 01:22:54.929
Well,

01:22:55.013 --> 01:22:57.682
there are people who
think that I'm insane.

01:23:02.062 --> 01:23:04.064
But I think
you're probably right.

01:23:08.902 --> 01:23:11.863
I've met another
man like you.

01:23:13.531 --> 01:23:15.033
I pursued his case,

01:23:15.867 --> 01:23:17.707
against the wishes
of my colleagues, of course.

01:23:19.204 --> 01:23:20.705
I told him
I could operate

01:23:22.082 --> 01:23:23.625
to make him fully a woman.

01:23:25.627 --> 01:23:27.045
That was what he wanted.

01:23:27.212 --> 01:23:28.755
Is that really possible?

01:23:28.922 --> 01:23:30.256
What happened to the man?

01:23:30.507 --> 01:23:31.966
Was the operation successful?

01:23:32.133 --> 01:23:34.678
On the morning of the first operation,
he ran away.

01:23:35.178 --> 01:23:36.221
He was too frightened.

01:23:36.388 --> 01:23:38.682
I wouldn't do that. I...

01:23:39.182 --> 01:23:41.059
Perhaps he was
the smart one.

01:23:41.309 --> 01:23:43.520
The surgery has never
been attempted before.

01:23:43.687 --> 01:23:45.021
Never.

01:23:47.190 --> 01:23:50.276
Professor Warnekros,
what is the surgery?

01:23:50.443 --> 01:23:51.861
Two operations.

01:23:52.612 --> 01:23:54.614
The first, to remove
the male parts entirely.

01:23:56.449 --> 01:23:58.169
The second, once you're
strong enough again,

01:23:59.452 --> 01:24:00.745
to construct a vagina.

01:24:08.962 --> 01:24:10.547
An irreversible change

01:24:12.924 --> 01:24:14.551
and a high risk
of failure.

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:16.970
Infections.

01:24:17.429 --> 01:24:18.430
Complications.

01:24:18.596 --> 01:24:20.056
It's too dangerous.

01:24:20.223 --> 01:24:22.225
It's my only hope.

01:24:25.061 --> 01:24:27.147
I leave for Dresden
at lunchtime tomorrow.

01:24:31.025 --> 01:24:32.652
Mrs. Wegener,

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.448
I do believe I can
help your husband.

01:24:38.324 --> 01:24:41.161
But he won't be your husband
when I've finished.

01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:59.220
I feel strange
going dressed like this.

01:24:59.387 --> 01:25:00.597
It's important.

01:25:01.931 --> 01:25:03.767
Hans said the Germans might
check your papers.

01:25:03.933 --> 01:25:05.226
You're nearly there.

01:25:06.770 --> 01:25:08.313
I won't be seeing you again.

01:25:11.107 --> 01:25:13.818
I've only really liked a
handful of people in my life,

01:25:15.612 --> 01:25:16.738
and you've been two of them.

01:25:21.743 --> 01:25:23.036
Take care.

01:25:27.207 --> 01:25:28.374
Take care.

01:25:33.630 --> 01:25:35.715
I wish you'd let me
come with you.

01:25:36.966 --> 01:25:38.134
I can't.

01:25:39.761 --> 01:25:41.471
You love Einar,

01:25:42.597 --> 01:25:43.932
and I have to let him go.

01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:52.065
Here.

01:25:53.316 --> 01:25:54.651
Take this.

01:27:50.934 --> 01:27:52.101
Hello.

01:27:52.518 --> 01:27:55.730
Um... My name is Lili.
I'm here to see Professor Warnekros.

01:27:56.356 --> 01:27:57.690
Lili what?

01:28:00.026 --> 01:28:01.110
Elbe.

01:28:01.861 --> 01:28:04.197
Lili Elbe,
like the river.

01:28:04.364 --> 01:28:07.742
Of course.
Please take a seat over there.

01:28:35.895 --> 01:28:37.271
Must I really wait?

01:28:38.189 --> 01:28:39.232
It's only a week.

01:28:40.817 --> 01:28:43.486
I need you to rest.
Gain some weight.

01:28:43.569 --> 01:28:45.238
We can't risk
an infection.

01:28:49.409 --> 01:28:51.411
For what
we are attempting,

01:28:53.079 --> 01:28:55.039
I'll need you
to be strong.

01:28:57.291 --> 01:28:58.918
This is not
my body, Professor.

01:29:01.212 --> 01:29:03.256
Please take it away.

01:29:10.638 --> 01:29:12.265
You're having a baby.

01:29:14.767 --> 01:29:15.768
And you?

01:29:16.477 --> 01:29:18.479
Oh, no, no. I'm...

01:29:19.564 --> 01:29:21.357
I'm ill inside.

01:29:21.441 --> 01:29:23.901
But Professor Warnekros
is going to make me better.

01:29:23.985 --> 01:29:26.195
And will you be able
to have children after?

01:29:27.947 --> 01:29:29.615
Do you know,
I don't know.

01:29:32.994 --> 01:29:34.495
I hope so.

01:29:39.584 --> 01:29:41.252
Gerda, why don't you go?

01:29:44.172 --> 01:29:46.382
He asked me not to.
He wanted to protect you.

01:29:46.466 --> 01:29:48.301
You should be there.
I'll go with you.

01:29:48.593 --> 01:29:50.595
If I go,
it will be alone.

01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:54.348
Now you're sounding
like Einar.

01:29:54.807 --> 01:29:56.350
I am like Einar.

01:29:59.270 --> 01:30:00.855
What do you
want me to do?

01:30:01.022 --> 01:30:02.982
I want you to go away.

01:30:03.149 --> 01:30:04.150
Really?

01:30:12.325 --> 01:30:14.494
No, I... Sorry.

01:31:20.434 --> 01:31:23.187
She regained consciousness
very briefly.

01:31:23.396 --> 01:31:26.023
We're having to give her a great
deal of morphine, of course,

01:31:26.107 --> 01:31:28.025
so that's
to be expected.

01:31:32.113 --> 01:31:35.074
You mustn't move, Lili.
It only makes it worse.

01:31:35.992 --> 01:31:37.076
Oh, God.

01:31:38.202 --> 01:31:39.245
Breathe.

01:31:40.371 --> 01:31:41.664
Breathe.

01:31:41.747 --> 01:31:42.790
Breathe.

01:31:49.714 --> 01:31:51.090
I'm here.

01:31:59.765 --> 01:32:00.766
It's all right.

01:32:01.726 --> 01:32:03.102
I'm here now.

01:32:07.732 --> 01:32:09.275
Lili.

01:32:30.421 --> 01:32:33.674
I can feel myself getting better
when I listen to your pencil.

01:32:40.306 --> 01:32:42.026
You've always sketched me
better than I was.

01:32:45.311 --> 01:32:47.271
But what you draw,
I become.

01:32:50.691 --> 01:32:52.318
You made me beautiful.

01:32:54.528 --> 01:32:56.489
And now you're
making me strong.

01:33:00.534 --> 01:33:02.495
Such power in you.

01:33:09.502 --> 01:33:11.754
Shall we go back to
Denmark, then, Gerda?

01:33:13.798 --> 01:33:15.883
Shall we go home?

01:33:34.068 --> 01:33:35.111
Lili!

01:33:35.861 --> 01:33:36.862
You're late.

01:33:40.032 --> 01:33:42.034
And your pills.

01:33:42.201 --> 01:33:45.204
Every two hours,
and I need to eat something first.

01:33:45.371 --> 01:33:47.415
I have some macaroons
in my bag all ready.

01:33:49.041 --> 01:33:50.084
And these.

01:33:51.919 --> 01:33:53.129
Only if you need them.

01:34:01.721 --> 01:34:02.722
Good luck.

01:34:12.023 --> 01:34:13.149
<i>And remember,</i>

01:34:13.232 --> 01:34:15.151
making a purchase
at Fonnesbech's

01:34:15.234 --> 01:34:18.738
is not merely shopping.
It's an experience.

01:34:18.904 --> 01:34:20.406
You lived in Paris, yes?

01:34:21.490 --> 01:34:22.491
Yes.

01:34:22.575 --> 01:34:25.703
Let everyone know.
The store is a stage.

01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:28.372
We're here to perform.

01:34:34.587 --> 01:34:36.380
In Paris, you see,
a lady would never dream

01:34:36.464 --> 01:34:39.425
of spraying the scent
directly onto herself.

01:34:39.592 --> 01:34:42.094
She... She would
spray it in the air,

01:34:42.887 --> 01:34:44.930
and then she'd
walk through it.

01:34:45.097 --> 01:34:46.432
Oh.
<i>Voila.</i>

01:34:48.267 --> 01:34:49.393
You try.

01:34:53.814 --> 01:34:56.192
Ah. <i>Voila.</i>

01:35:06.786 --> 01:35:07.995
Thanks.

01:35:08.079 --> 01:35:09.288
That's so unfair.

01:35:09.455 --> 01:35:12.833
You've got the sweetest tooth and the
narrowest hips in the whole store.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.086
How do you manage it,
eating so much sugar?

01:35:15.252 --> 01:35:17.129
The trick is
you eat nothing else.

01:35:17.296 --> 01:35:18.839
See you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.

01:35:21.467 --> 01:35:22.927
Bye, Lili.
Bye.

01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:25.846
Lili, are you coming?

01:35:32.144 --> 01:35:35.815
You know, one night last week,
I had the strangest dream.

01:35:37.024 --> 01:35:38.025
What was it?

01:35:38.192 --> 01:35:39.860
I dreamed you
were getting married.

01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:47.952
Do you think
I ever will?

01:35:48.119 --> 01:35:49.453
Who knows?

01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:52.331
So many strange things
have happened.

01:35:53.791 --> 01:35:55.835
I do want to, Gerda.

01:35:58.003 --> 01:36:01.465
It's not so long ago
we were married, you and me.

01:36:04.385 --> 01:36:05.970
You and Einar.

01:36:09.515 --> 01:36:10.975
I know it was Einar.

01:36:11.142 --> 01:36:12.560
But really,

01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:17.314
it was you and me.

01:36:39.003 --> 01:36:40.296
Lili.

01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:44.383
Is it really you?

01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:47.553
I believe so.

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:55.436
So, what you're suggesting

01:36:57.563 --> 01:36:59.398
is that, uh, a doctor

01:37:02.026 --> 01:37:03.319
intervened.

01:37:03.402 --> 01:37:05.529
To correct
a mistake in nature.

01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.865
He made you a woman.

01:37:08.407 --> 01:37:10.409
No, God made me a woman.

01:37:10.576 --> 01:37:12.786
But the doctor...
He... The doctor

01:37:12.953 --> 01:37:16.582
is curing me of the sickness
that was my disguise.

01:37:20.586 --> 01:37:21.670
A real woman.

01:37:39.939 --> 01:37:42.274
You're going to need a new notebook
if you carry on like that.

01:37:42.358 --> 01:37:45.069
When Warnekros suggested
I keep a diary,

01:37:45.152 --> 01:37:47.196
I thought I'd never
have anything to write.

01:37:48.989 --> 01:37:50.866
It does help,

01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:52.326
just to make
sense of things.

01:37:52.868 --> 01:37:54.495
Maybe I should try it.

01:38:00.125 --> 01:38:01.126
So,

01:38:02.545 --> 01:38:04.672
do you enjoy working
at Fonnesbech's?

01:38:05.130 --> 01:38:06.882
For now, at least.

01:38:06.966 --> 01:38:08.884
I do enjoy sort of
being part of it.

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:11.303
You never think
of painting?

01:38:14.682 --> 01:38:15.724
You might be good at it.

01:38:15.808 --> 01:38:18.310
Gerda, I want to be a woman,
not a painter.

01:38:19.478 --> 01:38:21.772
Well, people have been
known to do both.

01:38:26.193 --> 01:38:29.071
I'm curious to see
what you would paint.

01:38:29.154 --> 01:38:31.407
That's all. Sometimes it's
hard to know what's in your...

01:38:31.574 --> 01:38:33.993
Didn't you just take one
of those a minute ago?

01:38:34.368 --> 01:38:35.995
Gerda, I know
what I'm doing.

01:38:40.082 --> 01:38:42.001
I'm just going to
get some fresh air.

01:38:43.627 --> 01:38:46.088
You know, sometimes I do wonder why
you let me go through all this,

01:38:46.171 --> 01:38:48.173
if you thought that everything
would be the same afterwards.

01:38:48.257 --> 01:38:49.800
I didn't.

01:38:50.676 --> 01:38:52.676
But I promised Einar that
I would take care of you.

01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:55.055
For goodness' sakes,
Gerda, Einar is dead.

01:38:55.139 --> 01:38:56.765
We both have to
accept that.

01:38:58.892 --> 01:39:01.437
You took care of me, but now I
have to take care of myself.

01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:03.564
I have to have
a life of my own.

01:39:05.482 --> 01:39:07.526
And you need
to do the same.

01:39:10.863 --> 01:39:11.947
Come on, Hvap.

01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:29.380
Uh, yes.

01:39:30.591 --> 01:39:31.759
In London.

01:39:33.218 --> 01:39:34.345
Uh, is it urgent?

01:39:34.887 --> 01:39:36.347
No, that's fine.

01:39:37.264 --> 01:39:38.557
Just tell him...

01:39:40.893 --> 01:39:42.895
Just say it's a beautiful
day in Copenhagen.

01:39:48.817 --> 01:39:50.819
Morning.
Good morning.

01:40:14.843 --> 01:40:17.763
It's not what you think.
Henrik's homosexual.

01:40:17.930 --> 01:40:19.932
There's nothing
between us.

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.602
I should have told you
that I'd seen him.

01:40:23.936 --> 01:40:25.562
No, you shouldn't.

01:40:26.021 --> 01:40:27.661
He's a friend, Gerdie,
someone to talk to.

01:40:28.273 --> 01:40:30.275
Because you
can't talk to me.

01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:33.696
I've made a decision.

01:40:35.072 --> 01:40:37.157
I'm going back to Dresden
for the second operation.

01:40:37.866 --> 01:40:39.201
That's too soon.

01:40:39.284 --> 01:40:40.786
No... No, it's time.

01:40:40.994 --> 01:40:43.038
I need to finish
what I started.

01:40:43.122 --> 01:40:44.164
You're not strong enough.

01:40:44.289 --> 01:40:46.125
Professor Warnekros
thinks that I am.

01:40:47.209 --> 01:40:48.627
Warnekros?

01:40:48.752 --> 01:40:50.212
Warnekros hasn't seen you.

01:40:50.295 --> 01:40:51.505
I've made up
my mind, Gerda.

01:40:52.756 --> 01:40:53.966
It could kill you.

01:40:54.091 --> 01:40:56.343
I'm going on Friday.
Will you come with me?

01:41:00.389 --> 01:41:02.725
I won't help you
to hurt yourself.

01:41:20.284 --> 01:41:21.785
Gerda, will you come?

01:41:43.515 --> 01:41:45.934
This will be harder
than the first operation.

01:41:47.186 --> 01:41:48.520
You understand that?

01:41:49.772 --> 01:41:52.191
Yes, I do.

01:41:54.693 --> 01:41:56.612
It's complex surgery.

01:41:58.781 --> 01:42:01.700
And I will sleep
all the way through it.

01:42:05.037 --> 01:42:06.163
Yes, you will.

01:42:06.288 --> 01:42:08.707
And you'll be there
when I wake up.

01:42:11.043 --> 01:42:12.461
Of course.

01:42:13.462 --> 01:42:15.881
I want a husband
who looks just like you.

01:42:19.218 --> 01:42:20.219
Um...

01:42:21.011 --> 01:42:23.013
Maybe a child one day.

01:42:27.226 --> 01:42:28.977
Like a real woman.

01:42:30.395 --> 01:42:32.231
One step at a time.

01:42:39.738 --> 01:42:41.865
Get some rest.
Good night.

01:42:54.545 --> 01:42:56.088
Are you still
angry with me?

01:42:57.506 --> 01:42:59.258
I'm not angry with you.

01:43:01.218 --> 01:43:03.053
I'm worried about you.

01:43:04.847 --> 01:43:06.890
You heard my wish, Gerda.

01:43:08.433 --> 01:43:10.269
When no one else
could hear me,

01:43:11.603 --> 01:43:13.188
you did.

01:43:17.943 --> 01:43:19.069
Come.

01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:21.780
We both need our rest.

01:43:22.406 --> 01:43:23.740
I'll sleep on
the chair there.

01:43:25.784 --> 01:43:28.370
No, off to your little hotel.
I don't mind.

01:43:28.453 --> 01:43:29.997
Here, take this.

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:31.582
Because there's
a chill in the air.

01:43:34.459 --> 01:43:35.460
No.

01:43:35.544 --> 01:43:36.545
Please.

01:43:36.753 --> 01:43:38.213
You have it.

01:43:38.422 --> 01:43:39.756
For now.

01:43:40.632 --> 01:43:42.384
I'm going to be fine.

01:43:43.427 --> 01:43:44.511
Yes.

01:43:56.106 --> 01:43:57.274
Sleep well.

01:43:58.066 --> 01:43:59.484
Good night.

01:44:47.699 --> 01:44:48.825
Good evening.

01:44:50.869 --> 01:44:52.412
Uh, room nine, please.

01:44:52.704 --> 01:44:54.039
Number nine,
yes, of course.

01:44:54.206 --> 01:44:55.374
Thank you.

01:45:01.797 --> 01:45:03.090
Hans.

01:45:14.059 --> 01:45:15.602
It's all right.

01:45:15.852 --> 01:45:18.397
Everything will
be all right.

01:45:36.707 --> 01:45:38.166
Miss Elbe.

01:45:40.168 --> 01:45:41.378
It's time.

01:45:54.266 --> 01:45:56.268
Good luck, everybody.

01:46:03.775 --> 01:46:05.277
Swab, quick.

01:46:15.370 --> 01:46:17.831
Professor Warnekros
would like a word.

01:46:20.959 --> 01:46:22.794
She lost
a lot of blood.

01:46:22.961 --> 01:46:25.297
Now we are struggling
to keep the fever down.

01:46:25.797 --> 01:46:28.258
There's a chance it might
burn itself out, but...

01:46:32.596 --> 01:46:33.972
I have to be honest.

01:46:35.515 --> 01:46:36.975
The prognosis is not...

01:46:41.605 --> 01:46:43.982
Come here.
Just lie still.

01:46:45.317 --> 01:46:47.110
It's all right. Shh.

01:46:59.164 --> 01:47:00.540
Shh.

01:47:32.531 --> 01:47:34.241
Lili.

01:47:50.173 --> 01:47:51.424
How are you, Lili?

01:48:01.184 --> 01:48:02.561
I am

01:48:03.687 --> 01:48:06.731
entirely myself.

01:48:10.068 --> 01:48:12.195
You had us worried
there, you know?

01:48:14.990 --> 01:48:18.201
Can we go outside, Gerda?

01:48:21.204 --> 01:48:23.039
Into the garden?

01:48:23.206 --> 01:48:24.833
You should rest.

01:48:30.922 --> 01:48:32.215
Please.

01:48:52.694 --> 01:48:55.780
You mustn't worry
about me anymore, Gerda.

01:48:58.116 --> 01:48:59.784
It's an old habit.

01:49:01.286 --> 01:49:02.287
I'm slow to change.

01:49:08.293 --> 01:49:11.755
How have I ever
deserved such love?

01:49:18.094 --> 01:49:20.972
There's nothing to be
afraid of anymore.

01:49:22.432 --> 01:49:23.725
No.

01:49:27.312 --> 01:49:28.730
Last night

01:49:30.649 --> 01:49:33.568
I had the most
beautiful dream.

01:49:37.447 --> 01:49:39.991
I dreamed that
I was a baby

01:49:40.325 --> 01:49:42.744
in my mother's arms.

01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:47.832
And she looked
down at me,

01:49:51.127 --> 01:49:53.338
and she called me Lili.

01:49:56.132 --> 01:49:57.676
Lili.

01:50:24.035 --> 01:50:25.161
Lili?

01:50:34.421 --> 01:50:36.006
Lili!

01:51:50.747 --> 01:51:52.207
No, leave it!

01:51:58.463 --> 01:52:00.006
Let it fly.
