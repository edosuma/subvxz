It's just one typo.

08:01.303 --> 08:03.304
It's gibberish.

08:03.305 --> 08:04.873
Request denied.

08:08.377 --> 08:11.145
Wow.
You were right.

08:11.146 --> 08:12.881
All it took
was one mistake.

08:12.915 --> 08:14.716
You think that semicolon
was a mistake?

08:14.717 --> 08:16.217
<i>No, it was
a juicy piece of bait,</i>

08:16.218 --> 08:20.088
and she unhinged her jaw
and swallowed it whole.

08:20.122 --> 08:22.724
So you wanted her
to say no to us?

08:22.758 --> 08:25.426
Rejecting a valid request
for such a petty reason,

08:25.427 --> 08:28.062
that's all the ammunition
I need to go over her head.

08:28.063 --> 08:30.398
I secretly scheduled us
a one-on-one

08:30.399 --> 08:33.433
with Madeline's boss,
chief fisker.

08:33.434 --> 08:36.004
You wanna hear
the funniest thing ever?

08:36.005 --> 08:40.375
I also split and infinitive,
and she didn't notice.

08:40.409 --> 08:42.744
[Laughs]

08:42.745 --> 08:44.679
(Charles)
Hey, buddy.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.215
Did you check out the department
video camera by any chance?

08:47.249 --> 08:48.516
Yeah, I was gonna
take it home

08:48.517 --> 08:49.851
and videotape
the top of my head.

08:49.852 --> 08:51.886
I think I might be
thinning up there.

08:51.921 --> 08:53.254
Cool, cool.

08:53.255 --> 08:55.256
So I accidentally
left a tape in there,

08:55.257 --> 08:56.624
and I want it back.

08:56.625 --> 08:58.126
Why?
What's on it?

08:58.160 --> 08:59.427
Nothing.

08:59.428 --> 09:01.663
I just really need it
for no reason.

09:01.697 --> 09:03.832
Well, if you want
that tape back,

09:03.833 --> 09:05.733
I gotta get something
in return.

09:05.768 --> 09:07.502
Are you blackmailing me?

09:07.503 --> 09:09.103
I don't have
any money, Hitchcock.

09:09.104 --> 09:11.706
I'm still paying
my uncle's funeral bills.

09:11.707 --> 09:13.808
I rear-ended the hearse.
It was a mess.

09:13.843 --> 09:15.844
There's one thing I want,
and it's not that big.

09:15.845 --> 09:18.613
I just want you to make me cool
in everyone's eyes.

09:18.647 --> 09:20.448
Not that big?

09:20.449 --> 09:24.052
The Jimmy jabs has claimed
its first victims.

09:24.053 --> 09:27.388
Boyle, you made no impact.

09:27.389 --> 09:31.192
Also, Detective Scully has
withdrawn due to food poisoning,

09:31.193 --> 09:33.328
<i>which I think
we all saw coming.</i>

09:33.362 --> 09:36.664
All right, the second event
is "bulky bulky run run,"

09:36.665 --> 09:38.800
the bomb suit foot race.

09:38.801 --> 09:40.735
Sure hope I don't sprain
my arm during the face,

09:40.736 --> 09:42.637
'cause I'm gonna be
opening up a lot of doors

09:42.638 --> 09:44.038
for Katie
on our date.

09:44.073 --> 09:46.608
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be
a gentleman.

09:46.642 --> 09:48.343
What are you doing, Jake?

09:48.344 --> 09:49.677
Trash talking you,

09:49.678 --> 09:51.012
while simultaneously proving

09:51.013 --> 09:52.480
that I will be
respectful of your friend.

09:52.481 --> 09:53.782
It's a tough line to walk.

09:53.816 --> 09:55.316
[Inhales]
Gotta loosen up

09:55.317 --> 09:56.651
my flower-buying fingers.

09:56.652 --> 09:58.987
I'm gonna go nuts
on the daisies.

10:00.990 --> 10:02.090
On your mark...

10:02.091 --> 10:03.158
Get set...

10:03.159 --> 10:04.159
Ruffalo!

10:04.160 --> 10:07.228
[Rock music]

10:07.229 --> 10:08.496
Go!

10:11.333 --> 10:12.934
(Hitchcock)
I'm doing it, Charles!

10:12.935 --> 10:14.769
I look cool!

10:14.770 --> 10:15.937
Whaaow!

10:15.938 --> 10:16.938
[Thud]

10:18.941 --> 10:21.509
The next event will be
"keep your cover."

10:21.510 --> 10:24.245
Contestants must craft
an undercover persona

10:24.280 --> 10:26.748
and talk to as many
police officers as you can

10:26.782 --> 10:29.317
before being recognized.

10:29.351 --> 10:31.085
Pregnant.
Nice.

10:31.086 --> 10:32.921
Means ya had sex.

10:32.955 --> 10:35.857
Damn right, I did.
And I forgot my birth control.

10:35.891 --> 10:37.725
Yeah!
Yah!

10:37.726 --> 10:40.095
I think the belly will draw
attention away from my face.

10:40.129 --> 10:41.596
Smart. Like one big boob.
Mm-hmm.

10:41.630 --> 10:43.131
Jake will go first,

10:43.132 --> 10:44.599
then Amy, then Rosa.

10:44.633 --> 10:46.501
<i>On your mark,
get set,</i>

10:46.535 --> 10:47.535
Paul gosselaar!

10:49.138 --> 10:50.672
Please let me
have the tape.

10:50.706 --> 10:51.906
No dice.

10:51.907 --> 10:53.908
I don't know how
to make you cool.

10:53.909 --> 10:55.910
I'm not even
that cool myself.

10:55.911 --> 10:58.367
I mean, sure, I have a pizza stone.
You have cool friends.

10:58.380 --> 10:59.748
Like Jake.

10:59.749 --> 11:01.483
I just wanna be
part of a conversation

11:01.484 --> 11:04.452
where Jake uses my name
and nobody insults me.

11:04.487 --> 11:06.221
Damn it!
You ask too much.

11:06.255 --> 11:07.522
Ahh.

11:07.556 --> 11:09.457
I blew it.

11:09.458 --> 11:11.380
I only got through
two people.

11:11.393 --> 11:14.396
He's kicking so much.
You wanna feel?

11:14.397 --> 11:16.564
No! That's a bad idea!

11:16.565 --> 11:20.101
Oh, my baby!
It's on the side!

11:20.102 --> 11:22.270
Oof. I got to six.

11:22.271 --> 11:24.305
Dumb baby!

11:24.340 --> 11:26.641
People are right...
They ruin everything!

11:26.675 --> 11:28.777
Hey, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I wanna try.

11:28.778 --> 11:30.078
Let me be pregnant.

11:30.112 --> 11:31.413
Whoop!

11:31.414 --> 11:32.647
Adorable.
Right?

11:32.681 --> 11:34.416
I can't believe
I lost again!

11:34.417 --> 11:36.551
I was so psyched up for this.
What happened?

11:36.585 --> 11:40.221
Well... maybe being
so psyched up is what happened.

11:40.256 --> 11:42.357
Like every time
we're doing police work,

11:42.358 --> 11:44.259
you're always super-smart
and you stay calm

11:44.260 --> 11:45.693
and take your time,

11:45.694 --> 11:47.462
but every time we do
dumb games like this,

11:47.463 --> 11:49.798
you get all frantic
and act like a crazy idiot.

11:49.799 --> 11:53.068
My advice... next time
don't act like a crazy idiot.

11:53.102 --> 11:55.837
Thanks. That's surprisingly
insightful.

11:55.871 --> 11:58.039
Yeah, well, motherhood...

11:58.040 --> 11:59.908
Really opens a man's eyes.

11:59.942 --> 12:02.043
I finally feel as if
I'm part of something

12:02.044 --> 12:04.279
bigger than myself.
All right.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.280
Too much?
Yeah.

12:05.281 --> 12:07.449
Peralta.
What the hell?

12:07.483 --> 12:09.684
Where were you?
I got eliminated.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.786
[Dainty voice]
'Scuse me, officer.

12:11.787 --> 12:13.855
Yes, sweetheart.
Sweetheart?

12:13.856 --> 12:15.223
Seriously, Hank?
Is that how you

12:15.224 --> 12:16.658
talk to women
who come in here?

12:16.692 --> 12:18.030
Jimmy jabs.

12:18.060 --> 12:19.861
I didn't even make it
past one person.

12:19.895 --> 12:21.863
You're out?
I'm in the finals?

12:21.864 --> 12:23.465
And all I have to do
to get Katie's number

12:23.466 --> 12:25.100
is beat Amy?
Oh, that's nothing.

12:25.134 --> 12:28.136
Hey! Don't you dare
touch Amy Junior.

12:28.170 --> 12:29.537
[Gasps]
That's right.

12:29.538 --> 12:31.439
It's <i> your baby!</i>

12:31.474 --> 12:33.541
Are you sayin'
I knocked you up?

12:33.576 --> 12:35.543
You sure did!
[Sobbing] Jake.

12:35.544 --> 12:37.712
Hmm?
Can I talk to you for a second?

12:37.747 --> 12:39.814
Yeah, sure thing.
Hold that.

12:39.815 --> 12:41.015
Sure.
(Rosa) All right, Jake...

12:41.050 --> 12:42.484
You wanna call off
the bet?

12:42.485 --> 12:44.085
Seriously?
You're gonna back out now

12:44.086 --> 12:45.353
just 'cause you're losing?

12:45.354 --> 12:46.721
What is this,
a riverboat casino

12:46.722 --> 12:48.390
on the river of no rules?

12:48.424 --> 12:50.992
No. I'm giving you
a chance to call off the bet

12:50.993 --> 12:53.061
because it's clear you don't
actually want Katie's number

12:53.062 --> 12:54.729
because you're still
into Amy.

12:54.764 --> 12:57.365
What? That's crazy.
I just spent the whole day

12:57.366 --> 12:58.833
fighting for
another girl's number.

12:58.834 --> 13:00.802
Tsk. You spent the whole day
flirting with Amy.

13:00.836 --> 13:02.871
Yeah, we're joking around
because we're friends

13:02.872 --> 13:04.339
now that I've moved on.

13:04.373 --> 13:05.840
Then prove it.

13:05.841 --> 13:08.677
Beat Amy and don't flirt
with her at all.

13:08.711 --> 13:11.279
Fine. Easy.
But you better tell Katie

13:11.280 --> 13:13.081
to clear her schedule out
thursday for a date,

13:13.082 --> 13:14.916
'cause I am working nights
until then,

13:14.917 --> 13:16.551
and the following weekend,
I am out of town.

13:16.552 --> 13:18.422
Let's do this!

13:21.409 --> 13:23.043
Hey, Jake.
Question for ya.

13:23.077 --> 13:24.378
When I beat you,

13:24.379 --> 13:25.979
which victory dance
should I do?

13:25.980 --> 13:29.149
This one?

13:29.150 --> 13:32.019
Or this one?

13:32.053 --> 13:33.754
Oh, wow, okay.

13:35.890 --> 13:39.459
Both are examples
of victory dances.

13:39.494 --> 13:40.827
No comeback?

13:40.828 --> 13:42.929
After I burned you
with those moves?

13:42.930 --> 13:45.132
You must be
pretty nervous.

13:45.166 --> 13:46.633
Yep.

13:46.668 --> 13:48.235
Hey, Jake.
Hey, Charles.

13:48.269 --> 13:51.838
Who's this with me?

13:51.839 --> 13:54.241
Hitchcock?

13:56.277 --> 13:59.546
Well, we should go now.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.515
[Hitchcock laughing]
Wow!

14:01.516 --> 14:03.183
What a high!

14:03.184 --> 14:05.152
Do you guys feel
this way all the time?

14:05.186 --> 14:07.187
I did what you wanted.
Give me the tape.

14:07.188 --> 14:09.489
Oh, no,
we're not done yet.

14:09.524 --> 14:11.692
Next, I want you
to tell everyone

14:11.693 --> 14:13.360
you think I'm handsome.

14:13.361 --> 14:15.062
Make it seem natural.

14:15.096 --> 14:17.464
You are a monster!

14:19.067 --> 14:20.901
So they're calling
the drug "giggle pig"?

14:20.935 --> 14:22.603
<i>Chief fisker.</i>

14:22.637 --> 14:24.738
Sergeant Jeffords.
<i>Raymond.</i>

14:24.739 --> 14:26.106
Deputy chief Wuntch.

14:26.107 --> 14:27.441
I didn't realize
you'd be attending.

14:27.475 --> 14:28.909
I can tell.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.944
You have more of a fly-catching
gape than usual.

14:30.979 --> 14:33.046
<i>I've examined his proposal.</i>

14:33.081 --> 14:35.282
There's no proof that giggle
pig is a serious problem.

14:35.316 --> 14:36.717
So we're just
supposed to wait

14:36.718 --> 14:38.118
until it turns
into an epidemic?

14:38.152 --> 14:40.387
You're like the league
of nations in '36...

14:40.388 --> 14:43.390
Just hoping the abyssinian
crisis resolves itself.

14:43.424 --> 14:46.760
That's the lesson you draw
from the fall of addis ababa?

14:46.761 --> 14:48.862
Raymond,
you sound so naive.

14:48.896 --> 14:52.799
And you sound just like
Victor Emmanuel III.

14:52.834 --> 14:55.502
I have no idea
who's winning.

14:55.503 --> 14:56.770
I am.

14:56.804 --> 14:58.171
Captain Holt,
how serious a threat

14:58.172 --> 15:00.140
do you really think
giggle pig poses?

15:00.174 --> 15:02.075
Very serious.
Or it could be nothing.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.744
Or it could be
the new crack.

15:03.745 --> 15:05.112
The new crack?

15:05.113 --> 15:06.980
And you only need
$1,200 to fight it?

15:07.015 --> 15:08.815
<i>Well, in an ideal
situation,</i>

15:08.850 --> 15:11.351
we would attack the problem
with a lot more fire power,

15:11.352 --> 15:13.253
perhaps even a task force.

15:13.288 --> 15:16.156
That makes sense.
Let's make it happen.

15:16.157 --> 15:17.457
(Terry)
That was amazing!

15:17.458 --> 15:19.259
We got a task force!

15:19.294 --> 15:22.629
More importantly,
Wuntch got served.

15:22.630 --> 15:23.864
Oh, my God.

15:23.865 --> 15:26.433
Wuntch sounds like lunch.

15:26.434 --> 15:28.769
Now, this opens up
so many new avenues...

15:28.770 --> 15:29.937
You got your
task force.

15:29.938 --> 15:31.571
I'm surprised.

15:31.606 --> 15:33.040
That's funny, after 20 years,
I'd think you'd be

15:33.041 --> 15:35.143
used to me
slam-dunking in your face.

15:35.176 --> 15:37.844
I'm surprised you didn't see
what was going on in there.

15:37.845 --> 15:40.013
I got you riled up,
you oversold giggle pig,

15:40.014 --> 15:42.115
and now you're running
an expensive task force

15:42.116 --> 15:44.027
in a time of budget cuts.

15:44.052 --> 15:46.420
You better make
some big arrests... and quick,

15:46.454 --> 15:50.324
or you'll be the poster boy
for departmental waste.

15:50.325 --> 15:52.626
Slam dunk... returned.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.728
Not if we make those
arrests.

15:54.729 --> 15:56.830
3-point dunk.

15:56.831 --> 15:58.966
You guys really don't know
enough about basketball

15:58.967 --> 16:01.003

<i>(Woman) Go, Amy!</i>

16:19.687 --> 16:22.923
(Gina) Contestants must make it past
the barricade hurdles

16:22.924 --> 16:26.260
then use a bean bag gun
to get a snack.

16:26.261 --> 16:27.661
Ah!

16:27.695 --> 16:30.664
You will eat the snack
in its entirety.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.366
Ah!
Mmm!

16:32.367 --> 16:35.369
[Overlapping yelling]

16:35.370 --> 16:37.638
Come on...
Close, close, close, close!

16:37.672 --> 16:39.806
Ah!
Ugh!

16:39.841 --> 16:41.475
Next, head down
to the first floor

16:41.509 --> 16:44.411
where you will locate
a pamphlet about bullying.

16:44.445 --> 16:47.047
Then print out
a picture of me

16:47.048 --> 16:49.216
using a laptop from 1982

16:49.217 --> 16:52.519
whoever grabs their printout
first is the winner!

16:52.520 --> 16:53.854
Aah!

16:53.855 --> 16:55.389
Surprise twist!

16:57.392 --> 16:59.893
Aah!

16:59.894 --> 17:01.461
What are you doing, Santiago?

17:01.462 --> 17:02.963
Go!

17:02.964 --> 17:05.566
<i>(Jake)
Aah! You're burning my skin!</i>

17:05.567 --> 17:08.801
No broken rolly wheels!

17:10.771 --> 17:13.073
I did it!
I took my time,

17:13.074 --> 17:15.709
I wasn't a crazy idiot,
and I won!

17:15.710 --> 17:17.778
I finally ♪ wo-on ♪

17:17.779 --> 17:19.546
♪ Oh, yeah ♪

17:19.547 --> 17:21.381
Yes! Ye...

17:23.917 --> 17:25.586
What's going on here?

17:27.421 --> 17:29.590
Someone answer him
<i>now!</i>

17:29.591 --> 17:31.158
<i>Santiago!</i>

17:31.159 --> 17:33.293
Peralta!

17:33.294 --> 17:36.296
Boyle?
Hitchcock is very handsome.

17:36.297 --> 17:37.631
Why, thank you, Boyle.

17:37.632 --> 17:39.633
No one has anything
to say?

17:39.634 --> 17:42.903
Captain, what you just saw
was the Jimmy jab games.

17:42.904 --> 17:45.172
It's a bunch of dumb contests
we play to kill the time.

17:45.173 --> 17:46.640
Nobody even cares who wins.

17:46.641 --> 17:48.108
I won!

17:48.109 --> 17:49.676
It's stupid, but we like it.

17:49.677 --> 17:52.246
Clean this up. Now.

17:55.116 --> 17:57.117
Boyle, I'm ready to take
this to the next stage.

17:57.118 --> 17:59.086
You're gonna pierce
my ear... wait.

17:59.087 --> 18:00.754
What are you doing
in my locker?

18:00.755 --> 18:03.123
I can't do this.
I can't make you look cool.

18:03.124 --> 18:04.791
Because you're afraid
that Jake and I

18:04.792 --> 18:06.526
are gonna cut you out.

18:06.527 --> 18:08.829
Well, you're not wrong.
I'm gonna find that tape.

18:08.830 --> 18:10.097
You think I'd just leave

18:10.098 --> 18:11.765
something that valuable
lying around?

18:11.766 --> 18:14.167
I got it on me.
Oh!

18:14.168 --> 18:16.303
Gimme that tape!

18:16.304 --> 18:18.171
Ah! Gimme that tape!

18:18.172 --> 18:20.974
Jake! Help me!

18:20.975 --> 18:22.776
Ugh! Ah!
Uhh! Ugh!

18:22.777 --> 18:24.711
The serbian President's plane
is wheels up.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.813
Report to your motorcade
positions immediately.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.715
Let's go!

18:28.716 --> 18:30.617
Hey, you gave it
a good try.

18:30.618 --> 18:31.652
Sorry you lost.

18:31.653 --> 18:34.955
No. It's for the best.

18:34.956 --> 18:36.456
I let Amy win.

18:36.457 --> 18:38.392
Close, close, close, close!

18:38.393 --> 18:39.826
Ah!
Oh!

18:39.827 --> 18:42.729
You're right.
I'm not over her.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.385
Boyle, get out.
I need to talk to Jake.

18:50.386 --> 18:52.287
Okay. Bye!

18:52.288 --> 18:54.188
I warmed up the seat.

18:57.359 --> 18:58.793
Ugh, he did warm up
the seat.

18:58.794 --> 19:00.194
It's like a fire pit.

19:00.229 --> 19:02.330
Look, if you're here
for your $200,

19:02.364 --> 19:04.732
can I interest you in a check
that will definitely bounce?

19:04.733 --> 19:06.234
No. You will pay me in cash.
Ok.

19:06.268 --> 19:07.735
[Gulps]

19:07.770 --> 19:10.038
Look, I thought
I was over Amy,

19:10.039 --> 19:11.739
but clearly I'm not,
you know?

19:11.740 --> 19:13.074
I'm as frustrated
as you are.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.876
I'm not frustrated.

19:14.877 --> 19:16.544
But I am not
enjoying this.

19:16.545 --> 19:19.881
It is not like you
to get hung up on a girl.

19:19.882 --> 19:21.082
I don't know what to do.

19:21.116 --> 19:23.418
You call Katie.
That's what you do.

19:23.419 --> 19:25.587
Only way to move on
is to move on

19:25.588 --> 19:27.956
whether you think
you're ready to or not.

19:27.957 --> 19:30.325
Gotta get out there, man.

19:30.326 --> 19:31.793
All right.

19:31.827 --> 19:33.294
Thank you.

19:33.329 --> 19:34.562
Good luck.

19:36.031 --> 19:37.966
Are you okay, sir?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.801
I don't want to sound
dramatic,

19:39.802 --> 19:43.071
but today has been
sub-optimal.

19:43.072 --> 19:44.606
That doesn't leave
this office.

19:44.640 --> 19:46.441
<i>Muntch beat me.</i>

19:46.475 --> 19:48.676
The squad was a disaster.

19:48.677 --> 19:50.912
And in the end, you know
who I'm angriest with?

19:50.946 --> 19:53.147
Yourself?
No. Muntch.

19:53.182 --> 19:55.450
I need this task force
to succeed,

19:55.451 --> 19:57.185
and there's not
a Detective here

19:57.186 --> 19:58.953
who's adult enough
to lead it.

19:58.988 --> 20:00.822
Peralta and Santiago
were cowards,

20:00.823 --> 20:02.624
Diaz was disrespectful,

20:02.625 --> 20:05.093
and I just saw Hitchcock
and Boyle

20:05.094 --> 20:07.124
fighting like children.

20:07.129 --> 20:08.563
Get off...
Get off me!

20:08.597 --> 20:10.164
Hitchcock...
Gimme that tape!

20:10.199 --> 20:11.766
You're squeezing my boobs!

20:11.800 --> 20:15.103
Sir, I know you think
Rosa disrespected you,

20:15.137 --> 20:17.672
but I found her inspiring.

20:17.706 --> 20:18.906
She did what
I should have done...

20:18.941 --> 20:20.642
Stand up and tell you
the truth.

20:20.676 --> 20:23.111
And what truth is that?

20:23.112 --> 20:25.013
First, everyone else

20:25.014 --> 20:28.116
made this Wuntch-lunch
connection instantly.

20:28.150 --> 20:30.451
Second,
Wuntch didn't beat you.

20:30.486 --> 20:32.420
She saddled me
with this task force.

20:32.454 --> 20:34.622
You think she's consumed
with pettiness?

20:34.623 --> 20:35.657
You're no better.

20:35.691 --> 20:38.126
Yes, the task force
is risky,

20:38.127 --> 20:40.461
but it gives us a chance
to do a lot of good

20:40.462 --> 20:42.096
in the community.

20:42.097 --> 20:44.799
Sir, if you ask me,

20:44.800 --> 20:48.069
you're acting like a real
Victor Emmanuel III.

20:48.103 --> 20:50.939
You used that insult
completely incorrectly.

20:50.973 --> 20:52.507
But...

20:52.541 --> 20:55.643
I suppose I have let
Madeline... distract me

20:55.644 --> 20:57.378
from our purpose.

20:57.413 --> 21:00.682
Which is why I think Rosa
should lead the task force.

21:00.683 --> 21:02.012
There's no B.S. with her.

21:02.017 --> 21:04.018
Agreed.

21:04.019 --> 21:06.854
Thank you, sergeant.

21:06.855 --> 21:10.525
And... I know you were lying
about that Wuntch-lunch thing.

21:10.526 --> 21:12.022
That was mine.

21:13.862 --> 21:16.864
How was the motorcade?
Any assassinations?

21:16.865 --> 21:18.499
No. It was boring.

21:18.500 --> 21:21.102
Mmm. Well, thanks for
getting the tape back.

21:21.103 --> 21:22.604
[Hitchcock grunting]

21:22.605 --> 21:23.871
Oh!

21:23.872 --> 21:26.240
Oh, guys! Oh!

21:26.241 --> 21:28.209
I'll see you tonight
at my place?

21:28.210 --> 21:30.345
God, I hate you.
