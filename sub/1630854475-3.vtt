00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
<i> The far north of our planet</i>

00:30.640 --> 00:32.800
<i>is a land of extremes.</i>

00:37.880 --> 00:39.440
<i>When winter takes hold…</i>

00:43.160 --> 00:46.160
…<i>arctic winds cause temperatures</i>
<i>to plummet.</i>

00:49.800 --> 00:54.080
<i>Even the hardy Alaskan brown bear</i>
<i>must take refuge.</i>

01:02.520 --> 01:05.160
<i>Unable to endure</i>
<i>the freezing conditions,</i>

01:07.040 --> 01:10.280
<i>they are forced</i>
<i>to embark on an extraordinary journey.</i>

01:15.040 --> 01:18.800
<i>As the North Pole tilts</i>
<i>into the darkness and cold of winter…</i>

01:24.000 --> 01:25.680
<i>the bears begin climbing</i>

01:27.000 --> 01:28.680
<i>high into the mountains…</i>

01:32.960 --> 01:35.400
<i>to find shelter in caves or dens</i>

01:36.600 --> 01:38.480
<i>dug into the steep slopes.</i>

01:41.640 --> 01:43.160
<i>Hundreds of meters up.</i>

02:12.680 --> 02:14.880
<i>Bears living at the ends of the Earth</i>

02:16.760 --> 02:20.880
<i>must contend with the incredible</i>
<i>challenges each season brings.</i>

02:23.920 --> 02:24.800
<i>To do it,</i>

02:26.320 --> 02:30.240
<i>they rely on a very special connection</i>
<i>to the universe,</i>

02:31.240 --> 02:34.680
<i>because written into a bear's biology</i>

02:34.760 --> 02:36.840
<i>is every critical moment…</i>

02:38.400 --> 02:41.960
<i>…of Earth's</i>
<i>four-and-a-half-billion-year history.</i>

02:45.040 --> 02:47.520
<i>Events of unimaginable power…</i>

02:48.800 --> 02:50.040
<i>…and destruction</i>

02:51.480 --> 02:56.400
<i>that have created a world</i>
<i>like nowhere else in our universe.</i>

03:33.320 --> 03:36.480
<i>This is Luna,</i>
<i>a six-year-old female.</i>

03:41.480 --> 03:43.880
<i>Having reached the safety of her den…</i>

03:46.800 --> 03:50.000
<i>this will be her home</i>
<i>for the next six months.</i>

03:57.960 --> 03:59.120
<i>A cozy spot</i>

04:00.560 --> 04:04.400
<i>to see out the winter in hibernation.</i>

04:22.640 --> 04:24.520
<i>As the days get shorter…</i>

04:27.200 --> 04:29.880
<i>her body responds</i>
<i>to the rhythm of our planet.</i>

04:36.360 --> 04:38.480
<i>Her heart rate begins to slow…</i>

04:48.280 --> 04:50.280
…<i>to just eight beats per minute.</i>

05:04.880 --> 05:06.520
<i>As she settles down…</i>

05:08.600 --> 05:10.600
<i>her body temperature drops.</i>

05:30.800 --> 05:35.880
<i>And she falls into a deep, dreamful sleep.</i>

05:52.280 --> 05:56.760
<i>The powerful connection</i>
<i>between bear and universe…</i>

05:59.880 --> 06:03.520
<i>compels her to spend</i>
<i>the harsh winter months underground.</i>

06:07.960 --> 06:12.080
<i>Blissfully unaware</i>
<i>of the long journey ahead.</i>

06:17.160 --> 06:19.120
<i>Because outside the den…</i>

06:22.480 --> 06:24.240
…<i>Earth is on the move.</i>

06:34.280 --> 06:38.400
<i>Every day,</i>
<i>the planet spins once on its axis.</i>

06:55.320 --> 07:00.080
<i>Each month, the Moon completes</i>
<i>one full circuit around the Earth.</i>

07:07.040 --> 07:08.680
<i>And as the months pass,</i>

07:09.720 --> 07:13.320
<i>the Earth and the Moon orbit the Sun.</i>

07:19.200 --> 07:21.320
<i>During the time she'll spend asleep,</i>

07:22.320 --> 07:26.520
<i>Luna will travel 470 million kilometers.</i>

07:32.960 --> 07:34.920
<i>An epic cosmic voyage</i>

07:36.640 --> 07:38.640
<i>halfway around the Sun.</i>

07:47.560 --> 07:48.680
<i>And this year,</i>

07:49.560 --> 07:52.200
<i>she has some new traveling companions.</i>

07:55.560 --> 07:58.200
<i>While in and out of sleep…</i>

07:59.520 --> 08:01.640
<i>…Luna has given birth…</i>

08:04.040 --> 08:05.880
<i>to two little bears.</i>

08:12.320 --> 08:16.480
<i>The cubs will eat and sleep</i>
<i>in the den until springtime.</i>

08:19.600 --> 08:21.400
<i>But two more mouths to feed</i>

08:23.320 --> 08:26.000
<i>is taking its toll on Luna's body.</i>

08:33.120 --> 08:35.800
<i>Fat cells beneath her skin begin to shrink</i>

08:37.440 --> 08:40.800
<i>as her energy stores</i>
<i>are used up producing milk.</i>

08:48.920 --> 08:50.960
<i>After five months underground,</i>

08:51.840 --> 08:55.400
<i>Luna has already lost</i>
<i>more than a quarter of her body weight.</i>

09:01.120 --> 09:04.440
<i>And with outside temperatures</i>
<i>still locked below zero…</i>

09:06.560 --> 09:09.800
<i>Luna urgently needs spring to arrive</i>

09:10.640 --> 09:14.000
<i>if she is to continue feeding</i>
<i>her newborn cubs.</i>

09:22.080 --> 09:22.960
<i>Luckily,</i>

09:24.880 --> 09:26.360
<i>Earth has a happy quirk.</i>

09:29.800 --> 09:31.480
<i>It's tilted on its side.</i>

09:35.920 --> 09:38.800
<i>And so, as it moves through space,</i>

09:39.720 --> 09:42.240
<i>at different times of the year,</i>

09:42.320 --> 09:45.400
<i>different parts</i>
<i>of the planet lean toward the Sun,</i>

09:47.280 --> 09:49.640
<i>causing the seasons to turn.</i>

10:00.360 --> 10:02.000
<i>Which means, in Alaska,</i>

10:03.200 --> 10:05.200
<i>something remarkable is happening.</i>

10:12.880 --> 10:14.760
<i>With each passing day,</i>

10:14.840 --> 10:17.000
<i>the Sun gets higher in the sky.</i>

10:20.840 --> 10:23.680
<i>Its warming rays transforming</i>
<i>the landscape.</i>

10:34.080 --> 10:37.920
<i>Just when Luna and her cubs need it most.</i>

10:42.520 --> 10:46.080
<i>Nerve endings in her skin detect</i>
<i>the warmth of the Sun.</i>

10:53.880 --> 10:55.560
<i>And as the days get longer…</i>

11:01.120 --> 11:04.000
<i>…specialized cells in the back of her eye</i>

11:05.480 --> 11:09.000
<i>sense the tiny increases in light levels.</i>

11:14.680 --> 11:16.960
<i>These secret messages,</i>

11:17.040 --> 11:19.200
<i>direct from our nearest star…</i>

11:22.400 --> 11:26.280
<i>tell Luna it's time</i>
<i>to wake from hibernation.</i>

11:40.720 --> 11:45.160
<i>As they signal the gentle turning</i>
<i>of our planet's seasons.</i>

11:54.320 --> 11:56.000
<i>But out in the solar system…</i>

11:58.200 --> 12:00.040
<i>seasons like Earth's</i>

12:01.880 --> 12:03.200
<i>are far from typical.</i>

12:09.640 --> 12:12.160
<i>Our nearest neighbor, Venus…</i>

12:14.920 --> 12:16.680
<i>…is much closer to the Sun</i>

12:17.640 --> 12:20.360
<i>and so is much hotter than Earth.</i>

12:25.160 --> 12:28.120
<i>And because the planet has no tilt,</i>

12:28.960 --> 12:31.080
<i>it has virtually no seasons.</i>

12:35.480 --> 12:39.400
<i>Temperatures remain searingly hot</i>
<i>all year round.</i>

12:44.280 --> 12:45.560
<i>Further away,</i>

12:46.080 --> 12:47.480
<i>out past Earth…</i>

12:49.600 --> 12:50.920
<i>…is Mars,</i>

12:52.880 --> 12:55.680
<i>whose orbit causes its distance</i>
<i>from the Sun</i>

12:56.200 --> 12:58.440
<i>to vary dramatically through the year,</i>

13:00.160 --> 13:01.960
<i>making seasons on Mars…</i>

13:03.600 --> 13:06.440
…<i>far more extreme than our own.</i>

13:09.200 --> 13:13.880
<i>During winter, over a quarter</i>
<i>of the planet's atmosphere freezes solid.</i>

13:15.880 --> 13:17.040
<i>While in summer,</i>

13:18.120 --> 13:20.440
<i>when Mars passes closer to the Sun,</i>

13:21.240 --> 13:24.280
<i>the increased heat creates dust storms</i>

13:24.360 --> 13:29.280
<i>so severe</i>
<i>they can engulf the entire planet.</i>

13:33.360 --> 13:34.800
<i>But beyond Mars,</i>

13:36.480 --> 13:37.680
<i>past Jupiter…</i>

13:41.080 --> 13:42.000
<i>…and Saturn…</i>

13:48.080 --> 13:51.000
<i>…three billion kilometers from the Sun,</i>

13:52.600 --> 13:57.200
<i>Uranus has the most extreme seasons</i>
<i>in the solar system.</i>

13:59.840 --> 14:03.240
<i>This planet spins on its side.</i>

14:04.280 --> 14:06.240
<i>So as it orbits,</i>

14:06.320 --> 14:08.480
<i>the summer side faces the Sun…</i>

14:12.040 --> 14:17.080
…<i>while the winter side</i>
<i>won't see daylight for 42 years.</i>

14:29.400 --> 14:32.800
<i>Only Earth has seasons</i>

14:34.440 --> 14:37.440
<i>that, even at the extremes of our planet,</i>

14:38.200 --> 14:40.440
<i>allow life a fighting chance.</i>

14:54.520 --> 14:56.120
<i>With the arrival of spring,</i>

14:57.280 --> 14:59.600
<i>Luna's family emerge from the den.</i>

15:06.280 --> 15:11.000
<i>The cubs can now enjoy</i>
<i>their first moments in the Sun.</i>

15:35.880 --> 15:40.360
<i>But the turning seasons mean the cubs</i>
<i>must now set off on a daunting journey.</i>

15:48.280 --> 15:49.760
<i>Because to find food,</i>

15:50.840 --> 15:53.480
<i>Luna must lead them back to the lowlands</i>

15:54.760 --> 15:56.760
<i>on the other side of the mountain.</i>

16:13.720 --> 16:16.000
<i>It's a grueling climb for little legs.</i>

16:23.840 --> 16:27.320
<i>With hundreds of meters</i>
<i>of ice and rock to overcome.</i>

17:21.040 --> 17:25.280
<i>Once they're over the summit,</i>
<i>the hardest part of the trek is over.</i>

17:36.760 --> 17:39.920
<i>But survival is far from guaranteed.</i>

17:43.560 --> 17:45.920
<i>To make it through the rest of the year,</i>

17:47.240 --> 17:48.840
<i>the family will rely…</i>

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
<i>…on Luna's instinctive understanding</i>

17:53.200 --> 17:54.640
<i>of the seasons ahead.</i>

17:58.920 --> 18:00.280
<i>Each one…</i>

18:02.640 --> 18:05.480
<i>a result of Earth's yearly journey</i>
<i>through space.</i>

18:12.440 --> 18:13.840
<i>A journey that began…</i>

18:15.920 --> 18:18.960
…<i>before the Earth even existed.</i>

18:33.640 --> 18:39.600
<i>A time when our solar system</i>
<i>was little more than ash.</i>

18:43.120 --> 18:44.120
<i>No Sun,</i>

18:44.880 --> 18:45.720
<i>no planets,</i>

18:46.440 --> 18:47.600
<i>and no moons.</i>

18:50.360 --> 18:53.920
<i>Just a vast cloud of gas and dust.</i>

19:07.320 --> 19:10.960
<i>Then, in a distant solar system…</i>

19:13.400 --> 19:14.920
<i>…a star explodes.</i>

19:16.920 --> 19:21.800
<i>A supernova that sends</i>
<i>a shock wave across the galaxy.</i>

19:41.280 --> 19:46.280
<i>On impact, the shockwave</i>
<i>causes the cloud to fall in on itself.</i>

19:51.680 --> 19:53.440
<i>And begin to rotate.</i>

20:00.440 --> 20:02.640
<i>As it spins faster and faster,</i>

20:04.040 --> 20:08.280
<i>the cloud flattens out into a disc.</i>

20:10.200 --> 20:13.200
<i>A maelstrom of gas and rock.</i>

20:16.600 --> 20:19.400
<i>In the center, under intense pressure…</i>

20:23.040 --> 20:24.480
<i>…the Sun is born.</i>

20:28.080 --> 20:31.840
<i>While further out,</i>
<i>rock collides with rock…</i>

20:34.080 --> 20:36.200
<i>and our planet begins to grow.</i>

20:41.080 --> 20:43.480
<i>Until after 20 million years,</i>

20:44.880 --> 20:46.760
<i>Earth is fully formed.</i>

20:49.360 --> 20:52.720
<i>Still circling the Sun like the cloud</i>
<i>from which it grew.</i>

20:58.920 --> 21:02.280
<i>Orbiting once every 365 days,</i>

21:05.520 --> 21:07.440
<i>which is how Earth got its year.</i>

21:14.240 --> 21:16.600
<i>But at this point in the planet's story,</i>

21:17.760 --> 21:19.520
<i>it's a year without seasons.</i>

21:24.080 --> 21:26.720
<i>Because the chaos that created them…</i>

21:29.200 --> 21:31.080
<i>is still to come.</i>

21:41.560 --> 21:42.680
<i>In Alaska,</i>

21:43.640 --> 21:45.360
<i>the vibrancy of spring</i>…

21:46.600 --> 21:49.280
…<i>has given way to lazy summer days.</i>

22:01.480 --> 22:03.880
<i>The cubs are now five months old.</i>

22:06.600 --> 22:08.120
<i>And still learning…</i>

22:10.400 --> 22:11.560
<i>how to be bears.</i>

22:25.000 --> 22:27.080
<i>Because they're growing so quickly,</i>

22:28.040 --> 22:29.960
<i>the cubs are constantly hungry.</i>

22:36.520 --> 22:38.800
<i>And while it might look idyllic…</i>

22:41.040 --> 22:44.480
<i>summer in Alaska is a time of hardship.</i>

22:54.680 --> 22:57.520
<i>Without a decent meal to be found</i>
<i>in the meadows,</i>

22:58.040 --> 23:00.200
<i>the bears must make do with grass.</i>

23:11.240 --> 23:16.240
<i>Which means the cubs still rely</i>
<i>on their mother's milk</i>

23:16.320 --> 23:17.920
<i>for the bulk of their food.</i>

23:35.520 --> 23:39.800
<i>But Luna hasn't eaten properly</i>
<i>since before she went into hibernation,</i>

23:41.560 --> 23:44.040
<i>so she's running on empty.</i>

23:53.080 --> 23:56.040
<i>But nearby, out in space,</i>

23:57.520 --> 23:59.160
<i>help is on the way.</i>

24:05.880 --> 24:10.400
<i>Because today,</i>
<i>our planet has a constant companion.</i>

24:13.000 --> 24:14.040
<i>The Moon.</i>

24:16.320 --> 24:18.280
<i>Locked in orbit around the Earth,</i>

24:19.720 --> 24:22.320
<i>it's our nearest celestial neighbor.</i>

24:23.920 --> 24:27.960
<i>The largest and brightest object</i>
<i>in the night sky.</i>

24:32.120 --> 24:35.520
<i>And because the Moon</i>
<i>is very big and very close…</i>

24:37.760 --> 24:40.480
<i>it exerts a powerful gravitational pull.</i>

24:47.880 --> 24:51.480
<i>Strong enough to influence our world.</i>

24:56.080 --> 24:59.160
<i>It lifts the oceans away</i>
<i>from the planet's surface…</i>

25:07.520 --> 25:09.680
<i>…creating Earth's tides.</i>

25:15.960 --> 25:18.680
<i>And on a few days</i>
<i>around the full and new Moon…</i>

25:20.800 --> 25:25.400
<i>the lowest summer tides reveal</i>
<i>an entirely new landscape.</i>

25:29.760 --> 25:32.800
<i>Mudflats extend hundreds of meters</i>
<i>from the shore.</i>

25:39.120 --> 25:42.800
<i>Allowing hungry bears access</i>
<i>to buried treasure.</i>

25:50.560 --> 25:54.480
<i>At just the right time</i>
<i>for Luna and her young family.</i>

26:02.480 --> 26:04.720
<i>But finding what's hidden in the mud</i>

26:05.480 --> 26:08.200
<i>is a job best left to the grown-ups.</i>

26:17.080 --> 26:21.680
<i>Luna's sense of smell</i>
<i>is 2,000 times better than our own.</i>

26:24.480 --> 26:26.880
<i>Perfect for detecting tasty morsels.</i>

26:31.200 --> 26:32.680
<i>Soft-shelled clams.</i>

26:53.680 --> 26:56.200
<i>She's so skilled at prizing them apart,</i>

26:57.400 --> 27:00.200
<i>she can get through almost one a minute.</i>

27:20.440 --> 27:24.000
<i>The clams are a welcome supplement</i>
<i>to her meager summer diet.</i>

27:31.720 --> 27:34.600
<i>Vital energy</i>
<i>she can pass along to the cubs.</i>

27:39.800 --> 27:43.360
<i>These gifts, delivered to her by the Moon,</i>

27:43.880 --> 27:46.760
<i>will help Luna sustain her family</i>
<i>through summer.</i>

27:49.880 --> 27:52.480
<i>But the bear's relationship with the Moon…</i>

27:55.440 --> 27:58.440
…<i>runs much, much deeper.</i>

28:03.240 --> 28:08.280
<i>Because it was during the Moon's formation</i>
<i>that Earth got its seasons.</i>

28:13.880 --> 28:16.040
<i>Not long after it formed,</i>

28:16.960 --> 28:18.760
<i>our planet gained a companion.</i>

28:31.000 --> 28:32.800
<i>But it wasn't the Moon.</i>

28:34.920 --> 28:39.080
<i>It was another planet</i>
<i>that formed in Earth's orbit.</i>

28:44.520 --> 28:46.880
<i>A sibling called Theia.</i>

28:48.680 --> 28:50.800
<i>It was roughly the size of Mars.</i>

28:52.760 --> 28:56.680
-<i>A vast ball of rock and lava.</i>

28:59.440 --> 29:01.200
<i>Throughout their childhood,</i>

29:03.040 --> 29:05.120
<i>Earth and Theia lived in harmony.</i>

29:11.320 --> 29:16.280
<i>Until gravitational disturbances</i>
<i>in the young solar system…</i>

29:19.680 --> 29:23.400
<i>set the two planets on a collision course.</i>

29:28.880 --> 29:30.040
<i>In this moment…</i>

29:32.040 --> 29:35.040
<i>…Earth's future hangs in the balance.</i>

29:54.000 --> 29:56.040
<i>Theia is obliterated…</i>

29:59.480 --> 30:02.400
<i>as the impact melts both worlds.</i>

30:29.120 --> 30:31.400
<i>For an instant in cosmic time…</i>

30:34.560 --> 30:36.480
<i>our planet had two moons.</i>

30:46.360 --> 30:53.160
<i>But then gravity dragged one of them</i>
<i>back down to be consumed by Earth.</i>

31:06.720 --> 31:09.880
<i>Leaving only the moon we know today.</i>

31:17.040 --> 31:21.160
<i>And the collision transformed</i>
<i>our planet forever.</i>

31:28.280 --> 31:30.600
<i>The impact knocked it over to one side</i>

31:31.600 --> 31:35.040
<i>so that today it spins</i>
<i>with a tilt of 23 degrees.</i>

31:40.960 --> 31:43.760
<i>So, as it moves around in its orbit,</i>

31:45.600 --> 31:47.040
<i>first one hemisphere</i>

31:47.720 --> 31:51.640
<i>then the other is angled toward the Sun…</i>

31:55.000 --> 31:57.880
<i>giving Earth its seasons.</i>

32:19.600 --> 32:21.920
<i>As summer draws to a close,</i>

32:22.680 --> 32:25.200
<i>the longer nights are a sign</i>

32:25.280 --> 32:28.280
<i>that the harsh Alaskan winter</i>
<i>is fast approaching.</i>

32:32.560 --> 32:35.200
<i>The cubs are now seven months old.</i>

32:41.120 --> 32:45.640
<i>And Luna knows that if they are to survive</i>
<i>their long winter sleep,</i>

32:46.360 --> 32:49.400
<i>the family must build up</i>
<i>their fat reserves.</i>

33:06.000 --> 33:08.240
<i>But the Moon is a constant reminder…</i>

33:12.920 --> 33:14.400
…<i>help is on the way.</i>

33:19.800 --> 33:22.960
<i>A thousand kilometers</i>
<i>off the coast of Alaska…</i>

33:24.960 --> 33:28.480
<i>another creature is tuned in</i>
<i>to Earth's seasonal rhythm.</i>

33:32.200 --> 33:34.200
<i>Sockeye salmon.</i>

33:36.760 --> 33:39.080
<i>After two years roaming the Pacific Ocean…</i>

33:42.760 --> 33:44.120
<i>…they've reached maturity.</i>

33:46.080 --> 33:48.400
<i>And now, the changing day length…</i>

33:49.600 --> 33:52.680
<i>…triggers hormones</i>
<i>to be released into their blood.</i>

33:55.720 --> 33:59.080
<i>Chemical signals</i>
<i>that alter their behavior.</i>

34:08.080 --> 34:09.440
<i>Calling them home</i>

34:10.920 --> 34:13.800
<i>to breed in the rivers</i>
<i>where they were born.</i>

34:34.280 --> 34:36.080
<i>Luna's exhausted and hungry,</i>

34:37.120 --> 34:41.600
<i>but still she leads her cubs</i>
<i>to the river's edge.</i>

34:54.080 --> 34:59.000
<i>Because she senses something magical</i>
<i>is about to happen.</i>

35:04.080 --> 35:08.960
<i>Today, the unique clockwork of the seasons</i>

35:09.040 --> 35:12.400
<i>will deliver a vital lifeline</i>
<i>to the bears.</i>

35:33.520 --> 35:37.680
<i>The Earth has reached a pivotal position</i>
<i>in its journey around the Sun.</i>

35:41.720 --> 35:44.240
<i>And now the Moon raises the tide.</i>

35:50.000 --> 35:55.280
<i>Providing the final push</i>
<i>that drives the salmon into the rivers.</i>

36:40.480 --> 36:45.680
<i>At long last,</i>
<i>the cubs get their first taste of salmon.</i>

36:51.160 --> 36:54.960
<i>And although a single fish</i>
<i>will not see the bears through winter,</i>

36:55.920 --> 37:01.400
<i>it's the cubs' first real meal</i>
<i>in nearly eight months of life.</i>

37:18.040 --> 37:21.880
<i>The arrival of the first salmon</i>
<i>is a relief to Luna.</i>

37:24.720 --> 37:26.600
<i>Because experience has told her</i>

37:27.720 --> 37:31.200
<i>there will soon be</i>
<i>much richer pickings upstream.</i>

37:50.720 --> 37:52.720
<i>As the days grow ever shorter,</i>

37:54.400 --> 37:58.280
<i>the very same hormones</i>
<i>that set the salmon off on their journey</i>

37:59.200 --> 38:01.400
<i>now dramatically transform them.</i>

38:08.960 --> 38:10.560
<i>Their heads change shape.</i>

38:13.000 --> 38:15.680
<i>And their bodies blush bright red.</i>

38:19.040 --> 38:20.960
<i>As in their millions,</i>

38:21.480 --> 38:25.920
<i>they surge upriver</i>
<i>into their spawning grounds.</i>

38:36.120 --> 38:40.400
<i>And the final piece</i>
<i>of the bears' story falls into place.</i>

38:49.120 --> 38:52.520
<i>A story as old as the planet itself.</i>

39:02.680 --> 39:04.280
<i>The formation of the Earth…</i>

39:09.760 --> 39:12.040
<i>the collision that created the Moon…</i>

39:15.000 --> 39:18.840
<i>and our planet's unique relationship</i>
<i>with its moon and star…</i>

39:25.400 --> 39:31.520
<i>have combined to create a world</i>
<i>like nowhere else in the universe.</i>

39:33.920 --> 39:35.600
<i>A Goldilocks planet.</i>

39:38.600 --> 39:42.680
<i>The only place we know</i>
<i>that's just right for life.</i>

40:04.320 --> 40:05.360
<i>And for Luna,</i>

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
<i>four and a half billion years</i>
<i>of cosmic history</i>

40:10.920 --> 40:14.000
<i>is now distilled into this moment.</i>

40:21.760 --> 40:27.200
<i>The annual convergence of salmon and bear.</i>

40:38.160 --> 40:40.400
<i>And the precious opportunity</i>

40:42.160 --> 40:43.440
<i>to feed her family.</i>

40:51.120 --> 40:55.080
<i>Luna and her cubs now have what they need</i>
<i>to make it through winter.</i>

40:57.400 --> 41:01.960
<i>And while ultimately, their future</i>
<i>on our changing planet is uncertain,</i>

41:03.320 --> 41:06.480
<i>for this year,</i>
<i>the salmon will sustain them…</i>

41:10.400 --> 41:13.120
<i>as our planet continues</i>
<i>on this relentless voyage…</i>

41:15.680 --> 41:17.000
<i>…around the Sun.</i>

41:26.640 --> 41:29.720
<i>Next in the story of our universe,</i>

41:31.160 --> 41:34.720
<i>the ocean wanderer</i>
<i>whose life cycle reveals</i>

41:35.400 --> 41:39.320
<i>how everything in the universe was made.</i>

41:41.120 --> 41:43.400
<i>Because in every turtle's egg</i>

41:44.280 --> 41:46.680
<i>are atoms from The Big Bang…</i>

41:49.000 --> 41:52.560
<i>…forged as stars die.</i>

41:56.160 --> 41:59.000
<i>But how are stars and planets created?</i>

42:00.840 --> 42:07.080
<i>And how do the same ingredients</i>
<i>transform into living things?</i>
