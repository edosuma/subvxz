WEBVTT

00:16.725 --> 00:19.853
Ah! That's impossible.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.354
Really?

00:22.105 --> 00:24.065
I'm sure we did that when we were married.

00:24.065 --> 00:25.734
I'm not talking about that.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.694
I'm talking about the rowing machine,

00:27.694 --> 00:29.612
that it was able to hold us both up.

00:31.281 --> 00:32.991
It's a good selling point.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.452
You should use it on your next sales call.

00:36.077 --> 00:36.953
Okay.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.039
- Mm.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.166
Oh. Sorry.

00:46.212 --> 00:49.340
- Eventually you have to tell him.
-  I'll tell him soon.

00:49.340 --> 00:52.385
I... I think he's getting the idea
that something is up

00:53.094 --> 00:55.680
because I keep making excuses
not to see him.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.849
Why don't you just tell him the truth?

00:57.849 --> 01:00.977
That you met
the man of your dreams... again.

01:00.977 --> 01:03.021
It's not that easy, Luke.

01:03.855 --> 01:05.023
He's a good person.

01:05.690 --> 01:06.524
I get it.

01:06.524 --> 01:10.070
But is he taking you
for a romantic dinner at Masa,

01:10.570 --> 01:14.157
and then a concert at the Met,

01:14.157 --> 01:18.578
all wrapped up
with a beautiful night at the Ritz?

01:18.578 --> 01:21.956
- I've been dreaming about it all week.
- I know. You love all this stuff.

01:21.956 --> 01:24.876
We get to go on a real date again

01:24.876 --> 01:27.462
after what, a decade and a half?

01:28.046 --> 01:29.506
But you have to tell him.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.550
I will tell him before our special night.

01:33.635 --> 01:34.636
You have my word.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.472
Baby.

01:37.472 --> 01:38.807
You have my word.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.392
You have my heart.

01:55.824 --> 01:56.825
What you got there?

01:58.284 --> 02:01.246
Uh, just going through
old Eastern European files

02:01.246 --> 02:04.624
for potential Boro leads in case
the cell phone data doesn't pan out.

02:05.625 --> 02:06.501
You?

02:07.085 --> 02:09.212
I'm just looking for an in to talk to you.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.133
Look...

02:15.969 --> 02:16.803
as "Pooh Bear,"

02:16.803 --> 02:20.265
I've had hundreds if not thousands
of meaningless kisses in my life,

02:20.265 --> 02:22.767
and our smooch, it wasn't one of them.

02:24.060 --> 02:26.563
You lied to me in that bunker,
and you lied to yourself.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.691
You have very strong
romantic feelings for me,

02:29.691 --> 02:32.360
and you just... You just can't admit it.

02:33.862 --> 02:34.696
Aldon,

02:36.573 --> 02:37.907
I'm engaged.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.326
Well, then you have a decision to make.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.745
You can go for the sweet little baby boy
you've been dating

02:42.745 --> 02:44.414
that has an antiquing hobby

02:44.414 --> 02:47.375
and a cute backside that kinda looks like
a Cornish game hen's,

02:47.375 --> 02:48.501
or...

02:51.129 --> 02:52.255
you can go for all this.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.174
Okay, don't... Don't do that.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.259
You know Carter is more than that,

02:56.259 --> 02:57.719
and you are more than that.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.638
Thank you.

03:01.389 --> 03:05.393
I just... need some time
to figure things out.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.020
I'm... I'm willing to wait.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.940
You're, uh, more than worth waiting for.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.290
<i>Very good, Bengal.</i>

03:27.290 --> 03:29.375
<i>Good. Good.</i>

03:29.375 --> 03:30.710
<i>Now, shoot on goal.</i>

03:31.711 --> 03:33.379
<i>He shoots!</i>

03:33.379 --> 03:35.298
<i>- He scores!</i>

03:35.298 --> 03:36.424
<i>- Yes!</i>
- Hey.

03:36.424 --> 03:38.092
Did you hear the news?

03:38.885 --> 03:40.803
Kill order's been approved for Boro.

03:41.387 --> 03:42.722
Yeah, I heard that.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.432
Everything okay?

03:46.184 --> 03:48.311
Everything's fine. What's up?

03:48.311 --> 03:50.647
Well...

03:50.647 --> 03:51.606
I, um,

03:52.857 --> 03:54.943
I need some love advice.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.487
Eh, me and Tina,
our third date is coming up--

03:57.487 --> 03:58.905
It's the hanky-panky date?

03:58.905 --> 04:02.367
Yeah, and I am not
the most experienced lover.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.912
I've only been with one woman.

04:05.912 --> 04:06.996
Seriously?

04:06.996 --> 04:09.624
It was my cousin's cousin,
and it wasn't all that.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.000
She was kinda bossy.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.627
You had sex with your cousin?

04:12.627 --> 04:13.962
No. No way.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.256
My cousin had her own cousin.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.341
That's who I sexed with.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.760
Yo, I just heard from Dot
about the kill order.

04:23.304 --> 04:26.224
- What's going on here?
- Barry had sex with his cousin.

04:26.224 --> 04:27.475
It was a cousin's cousin.

04:27.475 --> 04:31.104
You know, when I was 19,
I had my eye on my uncle's second wife,

04:31.104 --> 04:32.814
but social norms and all.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.607
We had to pump the brakes at second base.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.485
Oh, so your uncle's second wife
is a no-fly zone,

04:37.485 --> 04:39.779
but your pal's daughter is game on?

04:39.779 --> 04:41.364
You really want to get into this now?

04:41.364 --> 04:43.825
I think we should focus on Barry
sleeping with his relatives.

04:43.825 --> 04:46.452
- Who I slept with is not the issue here.
- Kinda is.

04:46.452 --> 04:47.787
I only did it, like, five times,

04:47.787 --> 04:50.790
and I could just really use some advice
because I really like Tina--

04:50.790 --> 04:52.292
You guys hear about the kill order?

04:52.875 --> 04:55.295
Straight up
Find, Fix, and Finish directive.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.046
We are gonna Triple F him up.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.632
- What did I walk in on?
- Nothing.

04:59.632 --> 05:02.510
Barry's nervous 'cause he and Tina
are gonna make sweet, sweet love,

05:02.510 --> 05:04.595
and his experience is limited
to a few times with a family member.

05:04.595 --> 05:05.555
His cousin.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.932
So you cranked your cousin? Big deal.

05:07.932 --> 05:10.018
I mean,
I left my robe open for the mailman

05:10.018 --> 05:12.228
so he'd carry my packages
all the way to the front door.

05:12.228 --> 05:16.733
But the most important thing to remember
is that sex, it's a physical act, okay?

05:17.358 --> 05:19.110
You just gotta get up on your toes,

05:19.110 --> 05:22.447
and you just gotta create
a hearty momentum and just stick with it.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.240
It needs to be consistent.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.160
You have the balls to complain when
I don't want you to be with my daughter?

05:27.160 --> 05:30.288
Making love is not about the movement.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.372
Not movement.

05:31.372 --> 05:35.501
It's about passion, about love,
and about sharing.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.754
Not... None of that.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.923
I'm sure that works great
after you and the missus watch <i>60 Minutes</i>

05:40.923 --> 05:42.258
and push the beds together,

05:42.258 --> 05:44.260
but, Barry, you gotta focus on one thing:

05:45.053 --> 05:46.554
a great, big sex organ.

05:47.305 --> 05:48.264
I'm doomed.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.266
I'm talking about the brain, buddy.

05:50.266 --> 05:52.101
You wanna get a woman going,

05:52.101 --> 05:54.812
you gotta stimulate her between the ears,

05:55.396 --> 05:56.647
not between the here's.

05:57.231 --> 05:58.733
Whole trick is to go subliminal.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.152
You gotta work in words that sound dirty,

06:01.152 --> 06:03.654
like, "Look at those pussy willows."

06:03.654 --> 06:05.573
"I love fresh kumquats."

06:05.573 --> 06:07.367
"My grandpa has angina."

06:07.367 --> 06:08.576
There you go.

06:10.286 --> 06:11.496
Briefing is on.

06:12.497 --> 06:15.291
You guys are gonna talk about this
when I'm not around, aren't you?

06:15.792 --> 06:18.503
Thank you so much for sending the video.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.837
<i>She looks so much better.</i>

06:19.837 --> 06:22.048
Yeah. And she's riding Carter now.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.426
- Carter?
- Yeah, her new rocking horse.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.095
<i>Named it after her uncle.</i>

06:27.637 --> 06:30.139
<i>Em, you should've seen her face light up
when he gave it to her.</i>

06:30.139 --> 06:31.557
Spoils her rotten.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.851
Wow, that... that's so great of him.

06:33.851 --> 06:37.355
Um, well,
tell Romi Auntie Em loves her, and, um...

06:38.272 --> 06:39.190
I... I gotta go.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.317
Emma, are you okay?

06:41.317 --> 06:43.194
<i>'Cause you seem kinda off.</i>

06:43.194 --> 06:45.113
<i>- And Carter looked terrible.
-</i>

06:46.614 --> 06:47.740
Everything's so messed up.

06:47.740 --> 06:51.536
<i>I... I snapped at Carter for the horse
because it wasn't what I needed,</i>

06:51.536 --> 06:54.288
<i>but it seems he knew
exactly what Romi needed.</i>

06:55.540 --> 06:57.667
Sandy, I don't know. I mean, he's such a--

06:58.418 --> 07:00.044
A great guy.

07:00.628 --> 07:01.587
I don't know what to do.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.257
Oh shit. Is there someone else?

07:06.175 --> 07:07.468
Kinda maybe.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.470
<i>I'm so confused.</i>

07:11.097 --> 07:14.183
I was eight months pregnant with Romi
when I met your brother.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.396
I was not looking for a relationship,

07:18.396 --> 07:22.567
but... I knew the minute I saw him
he was the one for me.

07:23.151 --> 07:28.614
<i>He loved me for who I was, and I knew
he'd love me unconditionally forever.</i>

07:29.323 --> 07:31.033
Everything else was white noise.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.537
Carter loves you unconditionally.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.664
He loves your family unconditionally.

07:36.664 --> 07:40.001
Then... what's there to be confused about?

07:47.633 --> 07:49.719
Before we start, I wanna stress

07:49.719 --> 07:52.180
that we are heading into
a particularly critical

07:52.180 --> 07:54.056
and delicate phase of this matter.

07:54.056 --> 07:56.392
Can I assume that this team
can work together?

07:57.226 --> 08:00.521
Because Pfeffer says your sessions
have gotten worse than ever.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.064
To the point of uncommunicative.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.025
We're all fine here.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.401
Eyes on the prize, boss.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.695
Rumor mill has it you two hate each other.

08:08.404 --> 08:11.574
- Mm.
-  Uh, faulty intel, Director.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.784
That's right. I just hate her.

08:13.784 --> 08:16.496
Nobody hates me 'cause I'm delightful.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.540
Luke, Aldon, you don't have beef?

08:19.540 --> 08:21.542
No, ma'am, we're great friends.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.169
He would never say anything bad about me,

08:23.169 --> 08:25.671
or think that I wasn't good enough
for his daughter or anything like that

08:25.671 --> 08:27.298
because that would make him
a terrible person.

08:27.298 --> 08:30.885
And you guys, Frick and Frack,
you're not getting along?

08:30.885 --> 08:34.180
Listen, I was just grossed out
because he kissed the princess,

08:34.180 --> 08:36.224
and then he got into my personal space,

08:36.224 --> 08:38.684
but you know, circle-circle-dot-dot,
now I got my cootie shot,

08:38.684 --> 08:39.977
so it's all good.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.021
Fucking kindergarten.

08:42.021 --> 08:45.107
- Look, Director, we had our issues.

08:45.107 --> 08:47.485
But we squared it away,
and now we move forward.

08:47.485 --> 08:48.819
That's it, and that's all.

08:51.614 --> 08:52.532
Fine.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.909
This is the case as it stands today.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.828
Tech Ops cracked the encryption
on Cain's cell phone.

08:57.828 --> 09:00.248
Based on the cell phone towers
it's been pinging,

09:00.248 --> 09:02.291
Boro is hiding out in Sardovia,

09:02.291 --> 09:06.170
specifically a nuclear reactor there
that melted down in '89.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.839
Smart. He's using the radiation
from the disaster

09:08.839 --> 09:11.926
to mask the radiation signature
from his suitcase nuke.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.053
All that time in Sardovia?

09:14.053 --> 09:17.181
Boro Polonia is gonna fry his bologna.

09:17.181 --> 09:19.100
If Boro and his men take iodine tablets

09:19.100 --> 09:21.060
and they hide out
in the radiation-resistant

09:21.060 --> 09:23.563
concrete subbasement
underneath the reactor,

09:23.563 --> 09:24.897
they will actually be fine.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.649
Until we execute our kill order.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.943
I don't think that we should kill Boro.

09:28.943 --> 09:31.696
And we can't get his buyers from him
if he's dead.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.115
We tried that already, and we got burned.

09:34.782 --> 09:36.409
White House has been clear.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.787
Our new primary objective
is to neutralize Boro

09:39.787 --> 09:42.248
and retrieve every weapon
he's manufactured.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.668
Plain and simple,
get the nukes off the market.

09:46.460 --> 09:50.047
And due to the sensitive
and contested nature of Sardovia,

09:50.047 --> 09:51.841
this is a need-to-know mission,

09:51.841 --> 09:54.135
limited to the people in this room only.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.553
Okay, so what's the plan?

09:55.553 --> 09:59.223
Sardovia is a communist regime
with no diplomatic relations with the US.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.643
You can't just get in there
like it's Barry's cousin's pants.

10:03.894 --> 10:04.770
You wish.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.816
Seventh floor is putting together
a tactical operation as we speak.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.484
Once the details are confirmed,

10:10.484 --> 10:12.612
I need you ready to go
at a moment's notice.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.696
- Great.
- You got it.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.116
-  All right.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.623
<i>I don't think I could kill him.</i>

10:24.248 --> 10:25.499
Care to elaborate?

10:25.499 --> 10:29.462
Boro didn't choose to be the child
of a sociopathic criminal.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.757
He was always
this sweet, smart little boy.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.552
As a matter of fact,
I remember I bought him one time

10:36.552 --> 10:38.679
a little, cheap harmonica at an airport.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.765
Within days he mastered the instrument.

10:40.765 --> 10:41.724
He played songs.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.768
He was a real good kid.

10:43.768 --> 10:44.852
I loved him.

10:46.062 --> 10:46.979
But now,

10:48.147 --> 10:52.693
I feel responsible the way he turned out.
You know what I'm saying, Dr. Pfeffer?

10:54.320 --> 10:56.572
First, thank you for using my real name.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.366
I think these visits are working,

10:58.366 --> 11:01.661
and we're getting closer and closer
to a place of mutual respect.

11:01.661 --> 11:05.706
Second, are you sure you're talking
about Boro and not Emma?

11:05.706 --> 11:07.208
Care to elaborate?

11:07.208 --> 11:10.461
You said you had
a wonderful relationship with the child,

11:10.461 --> 11:14.173
but now you're starting to worry
about how it's fallen apart

11:14.173 --> 11:16.842
and how that child functions as an adult.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.219
And you feel responsible.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.805
Well, that fits Emma to a tee.

11:21.555 --> 11:24.558
You and she... barely talk now.

11:24.558 --> 11:26.644
You don't like her choice of career,

11:26.644 --> 11:29.689
the language she uses,
the men she chooses.

11:30.481 --> 11:33.734
You feel like you failed her as well.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.820
And perhaps,

11:35.820 --> 11:39.323
you need to accept
that in some ways you did.

11:39.323 --> 11:43.619
Maybe you need to unpack your feelings,

11:43.619 --> 11:47.081
grab onto those emotions,
and explore your heart a little.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.417
- Maybe you should--
- Let me guess.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.794
Maybe I should unpack a toolbox,
grab a flashlight,

11:51.794 --> 11:53.462
and explore my own asshole?

11:53.462 --> 11:55.715
You were gonna say
something snide like that, weren't you?

11:55.715 --> 11:56.757
Not exactly.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.175
- No, but close?
- Very close, yeah.

11:58.175 --> 11:59.719
You were ready to lash out at me

11:59.719 --> 12:02.722
because you know
that I hit too close to home.

12:02.722 --> 12:07.810
Now, I suggest that you think about
why that bothers you so much.

12:12.440 --> 12:16.152
So I was thinking maybe we could watch
<i>The Dark Crystal</i> again.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.070
Or maybe <i>Willow</i>.

12:18.070 --> 12:22.575
And I could, uh, mix the Goobers in
with the popcorn like you like.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.618
Ah, hold your horses, Barry.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.079
I have got a better idea.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.249
You like?

12:30.249 --> 12:31.667
Caroline Keene Kelley,

12:31.667 --> 12:35.337
the first ever full-time female Robin.

12:35.337 --> 12:36.839
Correct.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.175
Get that man a prize.

12:51.395 --> 12:53.230
To the Batpole, Robin!

13:04.742 --> 13:05.868
-  Carter?
- Hi.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.370
Hey. You haven't returned my calls.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.915
I haven't wanted to... talk with you.

13:11.540 --> 13:12.374
Oh.

13:12.374 --> 13:15.795
Yeah. Um, but your dad said
you were gonna be coming by here.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.506
Yeah, I didn't want them to worry about--

13:19.131 --> 13:21.509
About shopping when they bring Romi home.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.344
He also said you'd be leaving again soon,

13:23.344 --> 13:27.807
so I wanted to make sure that I...
said what I had to say before you left.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.892
- My dad called you?
- Yeah.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.394
God, he cannot
stay out of our business, can he?

13:32.394 --> 13:35.523
I'm glad he told me... what he told me.

13:36.732 --> 13:40.820
- Carter... you have to believe me--
- What am I gonna believe?

13:40.820 --> 13:42.238
You kissed him,

13:42.780 --> 13:46.408
and then you immediately
looked me right in the eyes

13:46.408 --> 13:47.910
and pretended that you didn't.

13:47.910 --> 13:52.748
Right? So I know that you
went on some vacation with him

13:52.748 --> 13:54.083
in Asia somewhere.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.961
I guess that's where you got
that bottle of stain you lied to me about.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.505
I did not lie to you about the stain.
I got it from the hobby shop.

13:59.505 --> 14:00.840
You lied about Aldon.

14:01.715 --> 14:03.592
You... you lied about kissing him.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.596
Yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah.

14:08.347 --> 14:09.348
I kissed him.

14:09.348 --> 14:13.310
It was really stupid,
and it's not... going anywhere.

14:14.103 --> 14:16.021
I've had time to think about it.

14:16.605 --> 14:17.439
Carter,

14:19.149 --> 14:20.109
I love you.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.278
You're the person I wanna marry.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.905
You're the person
I wanna have a family with.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.575
I realize that now.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.287
I don't wanna lose you.

14:35.332 --> 14:37.585
Carter, we love each other.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.756
Everything else is just white noise.

14:42.756 --> 14:43.716
Yeah.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.802
I... I will always love you, Emma.

14:46.802 --> 14:48.929
Uh, I just don't trust you anymore.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.181
I can't.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.185
Are you breaking up with me?

14:55.185 --> 14:56.520
I think I just did.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.064
A couple of seconds ago.

15:04.612 --> 15:05.487
Work.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.991
- I--
- I know, you gotta take this, right?

15:08.991 --> 15:09.909
Yeah.

15:15.497 --> 15:18.167
<i>♪ How lucky can one guy be? ♪</i>

15:19.251 --> 15:22.004
<i>♪ I kissed her, and she kissed me ♪</i>

15:22.671 --> 15:24.465
<i>♪ Like the fella once said ♪</i>

15:24.965 --> 15:26.842
<i>♪ Ain't that a kick in the-- ♪</i>

15:30.638 --> 15:31.472
You're late.

15:32.306 --> 15:33.223
You're never late.

15:33.223 --> 15:37.645
Was there a sale on the stupid toys
that you always buy with the big heads?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.229
They're called Funkos,

15:39.229 --> 15:41.106
and you can go Funko yourself

15:41.106 --> 15:44.360
'cause nothing's
gonna put me in a bad mood today.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.780
Oh, did our little Barry
become a man last night?

15:49.323 --> 15:52.743
A gentleman doesn't kiss and tell.

15:56.163 --> 15:56.997
What?

15:59.083 --> 16:00.042
Oh, for Pete's sake.

16:00.042 --> 16:03.045
Yes, we got it on, and it was amazing.

16:07.591 --> 16:08.884
What's going on?

16:08.884 --> 16:12.054
Ah, nothing. We're just celebrating
these two coming together.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.055
Literally.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.139
- Oh.

16:14.139 --> 16:17.184
Just, uh, make sure you fill out
one of those forms with HR.

16:17.935 --> 16:18.769
Time to work.

16:27.444 --> 16:28.487
Sorry I'm late.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.781
Turns out the same defense contractor

16:30.781 --> 16:33.534
has been in charge of protecting
the nuclear exclusion zone

16:33.534 --> 16:36.787
around Sardovia's reactor
for the past 34 years.

16:36.787 --> 16:39.540
But several days ago,
a new company took over.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.960
That only happens
when a lot of money changes hands.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.920
And Boro has a lot of money.

16:46.588 --> 16:49.675
Keyhole sats have noted
heightened security,

16:49.675 --> 16:52.094
upping checkpoints
on the only road in and out,

16:52.761 --> 16:56.098
and our assets have noted
increased monitoring at nearby airports.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.601
With our complicated relationship
with Sardovia,

16:59.601 --> 17:01.645
we have to enter very carefully.

17:01.645 --> 17:04.064
You get caught, you get killed.

17:04.064 --> 17:07.609
Oh no, that would be a tragedy
for three-fourths of us.

17:08.485 --> 17:10.487
You'll take the agency jet to Glasgow,

17:10.487 --> 17:12.031
change identities there,

17:12.031 --> 17:13.949
fly commercial to Stockholm,

17:13.949 --> 17:15.701
change identities again,

17:15.701 --> 17:17.411
before heading to Frankfurt,

17:17.411 --> 17:19.538
where you'll swap out IDs one more time

17:19.538 --> 17:21.790
before taking off for Baku, Azerbaijan.

17:22.374 --> 17:26.420
There, you'll assume final persona
and enter a special cargo system.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.047
What's the special cargo?

17:29.048 --> 17:29.965
Cadavers.

17:30.507 --> 17:33.677
Air Branch will fake a plane crash
in rural Azerbaijan,

17:33.677 --> 17:35.262
and the local friendlies will ensure

17:35.262 --> 17:38.849
the media reports
five Sardovians died in said crash.

17:38.849 --> 17:43.270
Allowing us and our weapons to be
transported into Sardovia in coffins.

17:43.812 --> 17:46.482
Azerbaijan has
diplomatic relations with Sardovia,

17:46.482 --> 17:49.318
so no one will question
why they'd help their neighbors

17:49.318 --> 17:50.819
by sending the crash victims home.

17:51.403 --> 17:54.656
Though Azerbaijan is not our ally per se,

17:55.365 --> 17:58.577
they do have common security interests
with the US.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.162
Common security interests?

18:00.746 --> 18:02.331
We paid them. A lot.

18:02.331 --> 18:05.167
As a result,
they'll be outfitting you with weapons,

18:05.167 --> 18:07.044
provisions, and tools for breach.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.463
- All will be packed in with you.
- In coffins?

18:09.463 --> 18:11.673
And so what happens
once we rise from the dead?

18:11.673 --> 18:14.885
You'll meet up with Sardovian agent,
Landon Fedorov.

18:14.885 --> 18:18.555
Landon is a good guy.
I recruited him during the Cold War.

18:18.555 --> 18:21.725
He will provide an armed escort
to the reactor's exclusion zone.

18:21.725 --> 18:25.062
He knows a safe point of entry
devoid of patrols and security.

18:25.646 --> 18:29.566
There, you'll use OTS-provided chemicals,
gear, and equipment

18:29.566 --> 18:31.735
to breach said perimeter,

18:31.735 --> 18:33.695
find the suitcase,

18:33.695 --> 18:35.823
and fix and finish Boro.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.161
We got our orders.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.455
Let's suit up.

18:44.748 --> 18:46.834
Oh, Xanax?

18:46.834 --> 18:50.003
You know that causes slurred speech,
drowsiness, and memory issues?

18:50.003 --> 18:52.673
It also cures "get in the box" issues.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.676
- I'm claustrophobic.
- What? Since when?

18:55.676 --> 18:58.303
Since my dad held me under a blanket
when I was six

18:58.303 --> 19:00.806
and yelled "fight your way out"
to toughen me up.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.891
It kinda had the opposite effect.

19:02.891 --> 19:05.936
- Your old man doesn't sound that bad.
- What's that supposed to mean?

19:05.936 --> 19:07.396
It means Carter dumped me.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.982
Why couldn't you just butt out?
All I did was kiss some guy.

19:09.982 --> 19:13.569
Oh, okay. I have a name. It's Aldon Reese.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.028
You cost me my relationship.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.114
Your bad choices cost your relationship.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.449
You can't have a marriage based on lies.

19:19.449 --> 19:20.826
Trust me, I know.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.494
And Carter deserved to know.

19:22.494 --> 19:26.165
I'll determine when Carter
needs to know things, okay? Not you.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.710
You determine that Carter needs to know
something and when he needs to know it?

19:29.710 --> 19:31.503
I mean, do you hear yourself?

19:31.503 --> 19:33.213
That's not what I meant, and you know it.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.799
Sweetheart,
I never thought I'm gonna say this.

19:36.550 --> 19:38.093
Carter deserves better.

19:39.344 --> 19:43.056
'Cause what you're doing to him
is exactly what I did to your mother.

19:43.056 --> 19:45.559
You mean what you're still doing to her?

19:45.559 --> 19:48.478
How can you lecture me
when you're setting her up for disaster

19:48.478 --> 19:49.646
all over again?

20:00.949 --> 20:03.535
Wait-- Where the hell are you going?

20:04.119 --> 20:05.370
I'm gonna make a call.

20:06.288 --> 20:07.206
Hey.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.667
I just picked up the blue dress you like
from the dry cleaners,

20:11.293 --> 20:14.254
and wait until you see
what I'll be wearing underneath it.

20:14.254 --> 20:16.548
<i>Oh, about tonight, um,</i>

20:16.548 --> 20:19.509
I'm gonna be out of town.
It's a last-minute thing.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.553
Oh, there isn't anything in your calendar.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.639
Like I said, it's a last-minute thing,

20:23.639 --> 20:25.891
so it won't be in the calendar.

20:25.891 --> 20:29.102
Oh no. Is this about Barry's gambling?

20:29.102 --> 20:31.146
No, uh, well...

20:33.774 --> 20:34.900
Luke, I'm not following.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.653
If you're busy,
we can do this next weekend, okay?

20:37.653 --> 20:38.987
And just so you know,

20:38.987 --> 20:41.406
I'm going off in 20 minutes
to talk to Donnie

20:42.074 --> 20:44.618
to tell him... about us.

20:44.618 --> 20:47.204
No, don't do that, um,

20:47.829 --> 20:49.248
<i>I've been thinking.</i>

20:49.248 --> 20:54.336
This whole thing is...
not gonna work out.

20:55.128 --> 20:56.255
-<i>Um...
-</i>

20:58.382 --> 20:59.883
You deserve better than me.

21:02.761 --> 21:03.971
That's fine.

21:04.763 --> 21:09.184
Uh, I knew the old Luke Brunner
would show up eventually.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.312
Tally,

21:13.855 --> 21:15.691
I just don't want to hurt you again.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.110
Right.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.405
Thanks for not hurting me, Luke.

21:27.744 --> 21:32.165
Two sugars, extra sweet, just like you.

21:33.417 --> 21:36.753
- ETA on the landing?
- Plane's about 30 minutes out.

21:36.753 --> 21:38.422
All that time spent in coffins.

21:38.922 --> 21:39.881
Spooky.

21:39.881 --> 21:41.425
- Speaking of spooky,

21:41.425 --> 21:43.802
once this Boro stuff is over,
we'll have free time.

21:43.802 --> 21:47.222
We could go into the city
to visit <i>Ghostbusters</i> filming locations.

21:47.222 --> 21:50.100
I got a limited edition
proton pack replica we could share.

21:50.892 --> 21:52.060
Not that I'm trying to boast.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.229
You ain't 'fraid of no boasts.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.442
- You're perfect.
- And you're awesome.

22:01.445 --> 22:02.779
But I, uh,

22:04.197 --> 22:06.074
I got paperwork today.

22:06.658 --> 22:10.370
Soon as the mission's over,
they are sending me back to the NSA.

22:11.663 --> 22:12.748
Maryland offices.

22:14.041 --> 22:14.875
What?

22:16.084 --> 22:17.252
I-- I wanna stay.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.422
I like this team, and you, a lot,

22:20.422 --> 22:24.134
but... I have orders.

22:26.887 --> 22:30.515
In <i>Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope</i>,

22:31.350 --> 22:34.019
Luke defies orders
and turns off his targeting system

22:34.019 --> 22:36.188
in his fight against the Galactic Empire.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.733
Wait, what are you doing?

22:43.236 --> 22:44.905
I'm gonna blow up the Death Star.

23:12.599 --> 23:14.351
- Everyone okay?

23:14.351 --> 23:15.977
Yeah, slept like the dead.

23:17.521 --> 23:19.398
Would've thought Roo
would be the first one out.

23:23.985 --> 23:25.946
Come on, Rooster, it's time to wake up.

23:32.285 --> 23:33.954
Hey, is it a snow day?

23:33.954 --> 23:36.289
Uh-oh, she's baked like a potato.

23:36.873 --> 23:40.836
- How many pills did you take?
- How many pills did <i>you</i> take?

23:41.545 --> 23:43.422
Okay, take care of Cheech.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.674
- Emma, let's gear up.
- Yeah.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.926
Buddy, come here.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.761
It's the night-night time.

23:55.725 --> 23:57.727
Boro's gonna get quite the send-off.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.981
Assuming proof's in the puddin'?

24:00.981 --> 24:02.399
Canary's in the coal mine.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.151
Traffic's light, commandeer some wheels,

24:04.151 --> 24:06.361
and you'll be on schedule
with your rendezvous with Landon.

24:06.361 --> 24:08.488
- Aldon, get a vehicle.
- Yep.

24:08.488 --> 24:09.781
Thank you.

24:10.407 --> 24:13.118
All right, I gotta go steal a ride.
You gonna be okay?

24:13.118 --> 24:14.661
Honk.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.288
Fantastic.

24:23.879 --> 24:24.880
Any news?

24:24.880 --> 24:26.339
Yanked on some red tape.

24:26.339 --> 24:28.508
I can put the kibosh
on your lady friend's transfer,

24:28.508 --> 24:31.887
but I'm gonna need
my back scratched too, muchacho.

24:31.887 --> 24:32.846
Whatever you want.

24:32.846 --> 24:34.431
When they moved Personnel
to the third floor,

24:34.431 --> 24:35.807
I left behind our espresso maker,

24:35.807 --> 24:37.934
and now those dicks in Cyber
won't give it back.

24:37.934 --> 24:40.812
Done. Easier than shooting womp rats.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.231
Just get my machine, putz.

24:43.231 --> 24:44.191
It's Putt.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.401
Hello?

24:53.575 --> 24:55.994
File says Sardovians
might've loaded the area with munitions

24:55.994 --> 24:58.205
after the meltdown
to keep enemies from the reactor,

24:58.205 --> 25:00.290
so maybe you slow down as we get closer?

25:00.916 --> 25:03.251
Landon will get us in safely.
Don't worry about it.

25:03.251 --> 25:07.088
He knows the area really well.
He's a great asset, a really good guy.

25:07.088 --> 25:08.840
You know who else is a good guy?

25:09.508 --> 25:10.342
This dude.

25:11.384 --> 25:15.639
You're so smart.
Look at you just reading away.

25:16.556 --> 25:20.060
Oh my God, your hair is so pretty.

25:20.060 --> 25:23.188
It's like a Shih Tzu
got it on with cotton candy.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.283
Who the hell are those guys?

25:35.283 --> 25:36.243
It's Landon.

25:39.579 --> 25:41.081
Son of a bitch double-crossed us.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.833
- Thought you said he was a good guy.
- He was a good guy.

25:43.833 --> 25:46.336
But we're spies
in an Eastern Bloc country.

25:46.336 --> 25:47.879
These guys get paid off.

26:18.451 --> 26:19.286
Clear.

26:24.958 --> 26:25.792
Shit.

26:31.381 --> 26:32.465
Clear.

26:32.465 --> 26:35.218
Well, that sucked.
I couldn't get my safety off.

26:35.218 --> 26:36.428
Probably for the best, pal.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.096
How are we getting into the reactor

26:38.096 --> 26:40.265
without Landon taking us
to the entry point?

26:40.265 --> 26:42.350
We might not have a covert way in,

26:42.350 --> 26:44.477
but we have a ton of weapons
in our shuttle.

26:44.477 --> 26:47.522
Maybe we have to go
more directly... and louder.

26:47.522 --> 26:50.108
Well, we should get moving.
When Landon doesn't report back

26:50.108 --> 26:52.819
to whatever Sardovian agency
wanted to take us out,

26:52.819 --> 26:54.279
- they're gonna come looking.

26:56.323 --> 26:57.282
- Don't move.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.909
I guess, uh,
wasn't as clear as I thought.

27:00.952 --> 27:03.079
Clean exit wound. Nothing major damaged.

27:03.079 --> 27:04.331
Just my body.

27:04.331 --> 27:08.418
Don't worry, bud. We're gonna put you
on that shuttle and get you help ASAP.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.220
That was on me. Mm-hm.

27:20.722 --> 27:23.767
All the nuclear waste is re-irradiated.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.561
Enough for 19 weapons.

27:26.561 --> 27:27.604
Nineteen?

27:29.689 --> 27:31.191
That's more than I anticipated.

27:31.191 --> 27:36.071
All you have to do
is put the C4, um, Cain procured for me

27:36.071 --> 27:37.030
in the suitcases.

27:37.030 --> 27:40.116
Detonation will trigger
the nuclear reaction.

27:41.117 --> 27:42.118
And that's it.

27:46.247 --> 27:47.916
It will be brutally effective.

27:48.583 --> 27:51.169
Now, please, I... I did what you want.

27:52.587 --> 27:53.838
Let me go home.

27:58.510 --> 28:01.471
Do you think that Steve Jobs

28:02.514 --> 28:06.267
became so powerful
because he was the best at what he did?

28:08.228 --> 28:09.229
Or because,

28:10.563 --> 28:12.023
through ruthless efficiency,

28:13.942 --> 28:17.153
he made sure no one else
could do what he did?

28:23.451 --> 28:26.538
I have to make certain...
that no one else on this planet

28:27.872 --> 28:30.834
can share how to make
a suitcase nuke out of waste material.

28:33.169 --> 28:34.045
And right now,

28:35.630 --> 28:36.840
you're someone else.

28:36.840 --> 28:37.799
No.

28:39.676 --> 28:40.719
No.

28:40.719 --> 28:44.055
No, please. Wait, wait.
You promised to set me free.

28:44.764 --> 28:46.558
That's exactly what I'm doing, Doctor.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.478
-  Hey.
-  Okay.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.063
How do you feel?

28:52.731 --> 28:56.901
How do I feel?
No food, no water, in hostile territory...

28:57.986 --> 28:59.487
- I've felt better.
- Pretty guy.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.408
- Just hang in there, okay?
- Yeah.

29:05.326 --> 29:06.202
Emma...

29:08.496 --> 29:09.706
he's in terrible shape.

29:10.373 --> 29:12.917
We need to get in
and out of here double-time.

29:12.917 --> 29:16.963
Guys, satellites show
a freshwater creek just six miles north,

29:16.963 --> 29:21.217
but the odds of it being contaminated
with radiation are over 94%.

29:21.217 --> 29:22.844
Pass. We'll be fine.

29:22.844 --> 29:25.305
There's also a dark square object
in one image,

29:25.305 --> 29:28.224
very symmetrical, just a few
hundred yards away from the creek.

29:28.224 --> 29:30.894
Symmetrical squares
aren't normally found in nature.

29:32.061 --> 29:33.980
Could be an access hatch or something.

29:34.606 --> 29:37.233
- I think that's our way in.
- What about Uncle Barry?

29:37.233 --> 29:39.986
Was he able to get any help
from our contacts in Azerbaijan?

29:39.986 --> 29:40.904
<i>Not sure.</i>

29:40.904 --> 29:43.615
He stepped out to make contact,
but he hasn't returned.

29:44.282 --> 29:47.076
I hate espresso. It's too strong.

29:47.577 --> 29:49.579
- Don't know how the Italians hack it.
-  Great.

29:49.579 --> 29:52.207
I'll just run up to Cyber
and get that machine out your hair.

29:52.207 --> 29:53.291
Nice try.

29:53.291 --> 29:56.044
I know Maggie wants it, which means
you want something from Personnel,

29:56.044 --> 29:58.171
which means I want something from you.

29:59.964 --> 30:02.467
- Name it.
- Ten dollars and twelve cents.

30:04.052 --> 30:06.054
Done and done.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.681
I don't want your money.
I want the money to come from Accounting.

30:08.681 --> 30:10.934
Specifically, a check signed
by that dictator, Farkas,

30:10.934 --> 30:12.894
who runs that fascist regime.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.187
Why does it matter, man?

30:14.187 --> 30:17.482
Four years ago,
I wined and dined an asset in Prague.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.859
When I'd submit my expense report
to Farkas,

30:19.859 --> 30:22.862
he'd only reimburse me
for the dining, none of the wining.

30:23.696 --> 30:27.033
Seems the CIA won't cover alcohol
without prior written permission.

30:28.243 --> 30:30.745
I am just trying to stop someone
from getting transferred.

30:31.496 --> 30:32.705
Then get me my check.

30:37.669 --> 30:38.503
Oh.

30:41.214 --> 30:42.173
Mrs. Brunner.

30:43.383 --> 30:44.551
Are you okay?

30:44.551 --> 30:46.219
Top of the world, Carter.

30:46.219 --> 30:49.264
So I was just dropping off
some of Emma's stuff from my apartment

30:49.264 --> 30:53.059
'cause I thought it'd be pretty awkward
if I had to see her again.

30:53.643 --> 30:54.602
You two broke up?

30:55.186 --> 30:58.481
Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah.
I'm surprised she didn't tell you.

30:58.481 --> 30:59.983
I'm not.

31:00.817 --> 31:01.860
Let me guess.

31:02.485 --> 31:03.862
She's away on business?

31:05.238 --> 31:06.656
Brunner family motto.

31:09.158 --> 31:10.076
Sit.

31:11.911 --> 31:12.787
Here.

31:15.039 --> 31:16.749
Getting jettisoned hurts.

31:17.417 --> 31:20.378
Uh, well, actually, I broke up with Emma.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.463
You did? Why?

31:22.463 --> 31:24.007
'Cause she cheated on me

31:24.799 --> 31:27.427
with, um, what's his name?

31:27.927 --> 31:29.304
Alton? Aldon.

31:29.304 --> 31:32.181
That really hot guy she works with?
The one with the shoulders?

31:32.765 --> 31:33.683
Shit.

31:33.683 --> 31:35.018
You need a double.

31:36.519 --> 31:37.645
- Pound it.
- Pound it?

31:37.645 --> 31:40.481
- Pound it.
- I typically like to sip more than--

31:40.481 --> 31:42.317
What are you, Amish? Drink.

31:42.317 --> 31:46.070
Amish don't sip drinks.
They don't drink.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.282
- Mm-hm
- Welcome to The Dump Club, Carter.

31:49.282 --> 31:51.284
us.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.746
So you got dumped?

31:55.622 --> 31:57.498
Yeah, you think somebody loves you.

31:57.498 --> 31:59.334
You give 'em your heart,

31:59.334 --> 32:04.505
but they grind it into protein powder,
guzzle it down with whey and kale<i>,</i>

32:04.505 --> 32:08.134
and fart it into the couch
while they watch <i>SportsCenter</i>.

32:08.134 --> 32:11.721
I... I really thought
Emma and I were a thing.

32:11.721 --> 32:14.432
I thought Donnie--
That you and Donnie were a thing.

32:14.432 --> 32:17.226
I... I'm sorry you're going through this.

32:17.226 --> 32:19.145
Yeah.

32:19.646 --> 32:21.773
I sincerely thought
you had found a really good man.

32:22.982 --> 32:24.692
I did, Carter.

32:27.862 --> 32:29.405
Carter, I gotta do something.

32:29.405 --> 32:31.324
But, look, getting off

32:31.324 --> 32:34.369
the Brunner family emotional rollercoaster
is a good thing.

32:35.119 --> 32:36.496
And I will always love you.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.165
And you'll always be part of this family.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.336
- All right, now get out of my house.
-  I...

32:43.336 --> 32:45.964
I love... love you.

32:48.216 --> 32:50.343
Hey, Donnie, I've been thinking.

32:51.135 --> 32:52.637
You and I should get married.

32:55.890 --> 32:57.725
You sure we're going
in the right direction?

32:57.725 --> 33:00.103
I'm into the INRA archives.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.938
They've got the reactor schematics.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.690
It's an old drainage system.

33:03.690 --> 33:06.484
The pipe will drop you
past Boro's topside security

33:06.484 --> 33:08.361
<i>and into the reactor's subbasement.</i>

33:08.361 --> 33:10.655
Good.
Then we just have to find the suitcase.

33:11.489 --> 33:12.740
And take out Boro.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.493
Roo, Aldon update?

33:15.493 --> 33:18.579
Uh, he's holding on strong, right, pal?

33:19.914 --> 33:21.499
I taste copper.

33:21.499 --> 33:24.168
We gotta wrap this up quick
if he's gonna have a chance.

33:24.168 --> 33:25.670
- I'm aware of that...

33:25.670 --> 33:26.754
...so let's move.

33:28.548 --> 33:29.590
It's Mom.

33:30.299 --> 33:33.011
"So you and Carter broke up.
I warmed you."

33:33.845 --> 33:34.846
"I warmed you?"

33:35.680 --> 33:36.889
She's been drinking.

33:38.558 --> 33:40.059
She's blaming me?

33:40.893 --> 33:42.603
Well, who else should she blame?

33:42.603 --> 33:46.315
Uh, I can think of 250 Austrian pounds
of blame to go around.

33:47.066 --> 33:50.361
One, I'm not 250. I'm 220 and all lean.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.573
Two, I didn't make
you and Carter break up.

33:53.573 --> 33:57.452
I didn't force you and, uh,
Aldon's lips together.

33:57.452 --> 33:58.411
All right?

33:58.411 --> 34:01.414
So not everything that goes wrong
in your life is my fault.

34:01.414 --> 34:02.331
Really?

34:02.832 --> 34:04.208
Let's look at the record.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.461
Before I'm forced to team up with Dad,

34:06.461 --> 34:09.547
great relationship, love my job,
happy as a clam.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.425
Afterwards, my relationship's
in the shitter, and I'm miserable.

34:12.425 --> 34:15.470
It's not my fault
that you agreed to a proposal

34:15.470 --> 34:16.971
to marry a guy you didn't want to marry.

34:16.971 --> 34:19.682
And then you go and kiss
another guy while you're engaged,

34:19.682 --> 34:22.018
and then you hide the truth from him.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.395
So stop blaming me for everything.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.065
You know,
just take responsibility yourself.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.858
Be a grown-up for once in your life.

34:28.858 --> 34:31.819
I mean, you were more grown up
when you were 15 years old.

34:36.324 --> 34:40.328
You know, Emma, I think that
we would've been friends when we were 15.

34:40.328 --> 34:42.580
We would've watched
<i>Veronica Mars</i> together.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.627
Novac's irradiating nuclear waste.

34:47.627 --> 34:49.921
The equipment is gonna require
a decent amount of space.

34:49.921 --> 34:53.007
So the suitcase
would have to be here or here.

34:58.638 --> 34:59.806
Farkas.

34:59.806 --> 35:02.725
Hello, Barry. I got your email
and came down immediately.

35:05.061 --> 35:06.270
I'll be right back.

35:16.239 --> 35:19.117
All right, so you'll authorize
the ten dollars and twelve cents?

35:19.117 --> 35:20.701
Oh, it would be my pleasure

35:21.285 --> 35:22.495
for a price.

35:22.495 --> 35:24.330
And I think you know what I want.

35:24.330 --> 35:27.250
- No. No way. No deal.
- Good day.

35:28.501 --> 35:29.335
No, wait.

35:35.591 --> 35:37.844
I am sorry for what I did.

35:39.762 --> 35:40.847
It was wrong of me, okay?

35:40.847 --> 35:45.434
I have no idea what you're talking about.
You'll have to refresh my recollection.

35:45.434 --> 35:48.938
San Diego Comic-Con 2019.

35:48.938 --> 35:49.897
I corrected you--

35:49.897 --> 35:51.190
Wrongly corrected me.

35:51.190 --> 35:52.859
Wrongly corrected you when I insinuated

35:52.859 --> 35:56.070
that you thought Grand Moff Tarkin's
first name was Moff.

35:56.070 --> 35:57.530
When clearly...

35:57.530 --> 36:03.035
When clearly any true <i>Star Wars</i> fans
would know that Moff was his rank.

36:03.035 --> 36:07.957
You humiliated me in front of my peers,

36:08.624 --> 36:11.836
and now you're going to give me
what you know I want,

36:11.836 --> 36:14.922
or it's ta-ta, Tina.

36:16.299 --> 36:17.884
You have your devil's bargain.

36:22.680 --> 36:23.973
- Let go.
- Okay.

36:29.103 --> 36:30.313
Here it is.

36:32.607 --> 36:33.774
Right up there.

36:35.109 --> 36:36.652
- Oh! Oh, oh.
-  Aldon.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.699
The wound isn't clotting.

36:41.699 --> 36:42.867
All right, he stays.

36:43.409 --> 36:45.995
Roo, put some pressure on his wound
until we get evac'd.

36:45.995 --> 36:49.582
- Okay.
- Uh, I don't think she's in any condition

36:49.582 --> 36:50.541
to care for anybody.

36:50.541 --> 36:53.753
What is so hard about it? You just press
the cloth against his shoulder.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.963
- It's the wrong shoulder, pal.
- Oh! Oh, sorry, my bad.

36:56.547 --> 36:59.091
- Emma, let's hit it.
- I'll be right there.

36:59.717 --> 37:02.929
Listen, you're gonna be okay.
We're gonna come back really soon.

37:02.929 --> 37:05.139
We're not gonna let you die
in a drainage pipe.

37:05.806 --> 37:09.518
And... um, I was thinking...

37:11.562 --> 37:13.898
maybe after all this,
we could really give it a shot.

37:13.898 --> 37:17.485
I mean, maybe you were right.
Maybe I just am afraid to admit that

37:18.486 --> 37:20.529
I actually do have feelings for you.

37:21.614 --> 37:22.531
Are you serious?

37:24.325 --> 37:26.661
You're so sad right now.

37:26.661 --> 37:29.372
You're only saying that
'cause Carter kicked you to the curb,

37:29.372 --> 37:30.873
and you're afraid to be alone.

37:32.708 --> 37:36.254
You know, I was willing to wait for you
if I was your choice,

37:37.129 --> 37:38.339
not your backup.

37:43.177 --> 37:44.053
That's fair.

37:44.804 --> 37:46.847
Today's a fluffin' shitty day.

37:46.847 --> 37:49.016
- You're telling me.
-  Yeah.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.152
Baby's in the bathwater.

38:00.152 --> 38:01.570
Chucky's in the cheese.

38:01.570 --> 38:03.281
We narrowed down
where Boro and the suitcase are

38:03.281 --> 38:04.657
to two areas of the subbasement.

38:04.657 --> 38:06.742
<i>One south, one east.</i>

38:07.326 --> 38:08.661
We should split up.

38:09.912 --> 38:13.040
If you see Boro, you're gonna
have to actually shoot him this time.

38:13.666 --> 38:14.875
What's that supposed to mean?

38:14.875 --> 38:17.336
You could've killed him in Guyana
when we had helicopter cover.

38:17.336 --> 38:18.796
He was in your crosshairs,
but you hesitated.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.172
I was lining up my shot.

38:20.172 --> 38:22.258
Thought you had the highest
marksmanship score in your class.

38:22.258 --> 38:24.468
What class was that, Intro to Jazz?

38:24.468 --> 38:27.179
Aldon's bleeding out.
We can argue about that later.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.598
Fine, just do your job.

38:57.668 --> 38:58.627
Hey, buddy.

38:59.253 --> 39:02.381
I just wanted to say
we're still best friends, all right?

39:03.090 --> 39:04.592
I'm really sorry for being a jerk

39:04.592 --> 39:08.054
and for hitting you in the sack
when I found out you kissed Emma.

39:08.054 --> 39:10.097
- It's not your fault.

39:10.097 --> 39:14.060
She lured you in with her siren song
and her cute little caboose.

39:14.935 --> 39:17.730
I gotta admit,
I got hypnotized by it once or twice.

39:21.859 --> 39:22.818
You okay?

39:27.865 --> 39:29.825
Oh shit.

39:29.825 --> 39:31.619
Mayday. Mayday.

39:31.619 --> 39:33.788
Barry, Aldon's struggling to breathe here.

39:33.788 --> 39:35.456
Just hold on. We'll get help.

39:38.501 --> 39:41.295
-  How long ago was he shot?
- Forty minutes. Comm.

39:44.882 --> 39:46.425
Aldon, what's the good word?

39:47.093 --> 39:49.970
I think I'm having trouble
trying to stay awake, doc.

39:49.970 --> 39:53.182
- No, no, no.
- Okay, Roo, I'm FaceTiming you.

39:53.182 --> 39:55.559
-  <i>Show me the wound.</i>
-  Oh.

39:55.559 --> 39:58.521
-  <i>Which way do I point this thing?</i>
-  That's your face, sweetheart.

39:58.521 --> 40:01.357
- She's a little stoned.

40:01.357 --> 40:02.316
Fantastic.

40:02.316 --> 40:05.194
Okay, Roo, hold the camera still,
but turn it around.

40:05.194 --> 40:07.613
-  Here we go.
-]
Pfeffer] Okay, that's good.

40:08.197 --> 40:10.991
Discoloration of the neck,
substantial edema,

40:10.991 --> 40:14.370
textbook tracheal deviation,
and subcutaneous emphysema.

40:14.370 --> 40:15.704
Which means?

40:15.704 --> 40:17.790
Means Roo's gonna
have to get her hands dirty.

40:17.790 --> 40:18.707
Roo...

40:18.707 --> 40:20.709
<i>Aldon's got a severely collapsed lung.</i>

40:20.709 --> 40:23.546
<i>You're gonna have to inflate it,
or he'll go into cardiac arrest.</i>

40:23.546 --> 40:25.256
Okay, Dr. P.

40:25.256 --> 40:28.300
All right, don't worry, buddy.
I'm scrubbing in.

41:27.651 --> 41:29.278
No, I already told you.

41:30.070 --> 41:31.906
I'm not delaying the auction, Volek.

41:32.781 --> 41:34.325
No, that's not acceptable.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.035
Our deal was clear.

41:36.035 --> 41:39.788
I'll cancel the damn thing when you
deliver Finn Hoss and Danielle DeRosa.

41:40.289 --> 41:42.291
Anything less,
the auction goes on as planned.

41:42.875 --> 41:44.251
You looking for Finn Hoss?

41:45.294 --> 41:46.420
He's right behind you.

41:50.633 --> 41:51.509
Hello, Finn.

41:52.718 --> 41:54.386
I don't want to kill you, Bengal,

41:55.387 --> 41:57.473
so just turn around and raise your hands.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.324
I found everything you said, doc.

42:15.324 --> 42:16.992
I just couldn't find any water.

42:16.992 --> 42:18.619
We need it to create the vacuum.

42:18.619 --> 42:21.580
<i>Well, sorry I don't just carry
a pint of liquid on me.</i>

42:22.748 --> 42:26.544
No, but you do carry it <i>in</i> you.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.171
<i>Nope. No. Mm-mm.</i>

42:29.171 --> 42:31.382
-  No way.
- Pee in the jar, Roo.

42:31.382 --> 42:33.509
I am not that high anymore.

42:33.509 --> 42:36.303
Pee in the jar, or I die.

42:36.887 --> 42:39.640
Goddamn it!

42:50.651 --> 42:51.777
Oh man.

42:55.614 --> 42:57.950
Just for the record, I may come up dry.

42:58.534 --> 43:00.494
You know I have issues peeing in public.

43:04.540 --> 43:06.000
Nothing's happening.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.210
Shy bladder is
a common psychological condition.

43:08.210 --> 43:11.046
Studies show
if you focus on something else,

43:11.046 --> 43:12.131
<i>you'll be able to urinate.</i>

43:12.798 --> 43:13.924
Singing works well.

43:13.924 --> 43:15.175
I don't sing.

43:15.175 --> 43:17.094
<i>Nothing's coming out, doc.</i>

43:17.094 --> 43:18.887
Tattletale, you shut your mouth.

43:19.471 --> 43:21.140
Let the music flow, Roo,

43:21.640 --> 43:23.559
and the urine will follow.

43:26.729 --> 43:29.773
Remember that drive
you and I took out to Mohonk?

43:30.733 --> 43:33.319
The Gordon Lightfoot CD
that was left in the rental?

43:34.737 --> 43:37.906

There you go, pal.

44:17.154 --> 44:19.615
- Liquid gold.

44:34.380 --> 44:35.297
Hey!

44:36.548 --> 44:37.966
Eyes on Boro, east wing!

44:42.137 --> 44:46.684
Hm. The minute I met you,
I knew I'd kill you.

44:46.684 --> 44:49.895
The minute I met you,
I knew you were a dick.

45:33.981 --> 45:35.190
<i>Et tu</i>, Dani?

45:46.702 --> 45:47.786
Where are the nukes?

45:50.831 --> 45:52.583
You can look for them in hell.

46:02.426 --> 46:03.260
Shit.

46:31.121 --> 46:32.039
Emma?

46:32.790 --> 46:34.291
Emma, do you copy?

46:34.875 --> 46:37.127
Luke? Thank God.

46:37.711 --> 46:39.087
<i>We lost contact there.</i>

46:39.087 --> 46:41.465
<i>- Was that an explosion?</i>
- Multiple.

46:41.465 --> 46:43.383
But I can't get in touch with Emma.

46:43.383 --> 46:46.220
<i>Emma said she had eyes on Boro
in the east wing,</i>

46:46.220 --> 46:48.347
but the whole place has totally collapsed.

46:52.226 --> 46:53.560
Emma may be trapped.

46:55.604 --> 46:58.357
Barry, there's fire everywhere.

46:58.357 --> 47:02.569
Sir, I've accessed the State Nuclear
Regulatory Inspectorate of Sardovia.

47:02.569 --> 47:05.906
<i>They have a geothermal reader
that they placed underground</i>

47:05.906 --> 47:08.575
to alert if the radiation
ever breaches the basement.

47:08.575 --> 47:11.036
- It is really heating up.
- And?

47:11.036 --> 47:15.040
And Boro's suitcase nuke uses
black powder as the explosive trigger.

47:15.040 --> 47:16.959
If that nuke is anywhere near fire...

47:16.959 --> 47:19.211
The heat will set off the blasting caps.

47:19.211 --> 47:21.588
And the suitcase nuke detonates.

47:22.756 --> 47:24.007
Killing all of you.

47:26.093 --> 47:26.927
Hello?

47:28.095 --> 47:29.805
Anyone?

47:30.722 --> 47:32.099
Team, do you copy?

47:32.808 --> 47:34.268
Team, do you copy?

47:39.690 --> 47:40.858
Shit.

47:56.248 --> 47:57.416
Hello?

47:59.001 --> 48:00.252
Can anyone hear me?

48:03.505 --> 48:04.590
Loud and clear.

48:09.094 --> 48:10.721
Looks like it's just you and me.
