IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:07.408 --> 00:11.045
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.079 --> 00:13.547
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:13.581 --> 00:15.383
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:15.416 --> 00:16.717
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:16.750 --> 00:19.087
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.322
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.758
[slams against locker]
>> UNH!

00:24.792 --> 00:26.794
[breathing heavily]

00:29.663 --> 00:31.065
[bell ringing]

00:31.099 --> 00:33.101
>> HEY, I GOT TO GO TO CLASS.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.236
>> ALL RIGHT, CALL ME LATER.
>> ALL RIGHT, I WILL.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.105
I LOVE YOU.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.146
>> AND WE'VE SEEN
WHAT HE LOVES.

00:45.179 --> 00:46.180
>> HEY, KIM, BABY.

00:46.214 --> 00:47.481
>> HEY, KIM,

00:47.515 --> 00:48.649
WANT TO BORROW MY WONDERBRA?

00:48.682 --> 00:49.783
>> THERE'S NO HIDING IT NOW.

00:49.817 --> 00:52.353
>> WHEN'S THE NEXT SHOW?
>> WHO ELSE YOU PUTTING OUT FOR?

00:52.386 --> 00:53.354
>> WHAT?

00:53.387 --> 00:54.822
AAH!

00:59.193 --> 01:00.494
>> CALL AN AMBULANCE!

01:00.528 --> 01:01.595
>> KIMBERLY GARNET--

01:01.629 --> 01:05.099
15, SHE WAS IN A COMA
FROM AN INTRACRANIAL BLEED.

01:05.133 --> 01:07.135
PARENTS ARE WITH HER.
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

01:07.168 --> 01:09.137
>> SHE FELL DOWN THE STAIRS
AT SCHOOL.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.104
>> SOMEBODY PUSH HER?

01:10.138 --> 01:11.772
>> NO, SHE TRIPPED.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.107
>> SO WHY'D YOU CALL US?

01:13.141 --> 01:15.776
>> THIS GIRL'S BEEN
PHYSICALLY ABUSED.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.145
I FOUND A BRUISE ON HER SCALP

01:17.178 --> 01:18.446
THAT'S PURPLE AND RED.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.148
FRESH ONE
WOULD BE YELLOW AND BLUE.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.081
>> SO IT'S NOT FROM THE FALL.

01:21.115 --> 01:22.716
>> MY GUESS--
SHE WAS KICKED IN THE HEAD

01:22.750 --> 01:25.619
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO,
AND IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.121
SEE THESE WHITE SPOTS?

01:27.155 --> 01:28.756
THEY'RE CALCIFICATIONS,

01:28.789 --> 01:30.858
PROBABLY FROM
AN OLD SUBDURAL HEMATOMA.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.760
>> HOW OLD?
>> ABOUT EIGHT TO TEN MONTHS.

01:32.793 --> 01:35.829
AS SOON AS I SAW THIS,
I ORDERED A FULL-BODY SCAN.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.567
>> OKAY, SO WHAT
ARE WE LOOKING AT NOW?

01:39.600 --> 01:41.802
>> HEALED RIB FRACTURES,
AND LOOK AT THE SHOULDER--

01:41.835 --> 01:44.172
BONE CHIPS
AND A PREVIOUS EVULSION.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.840
>> SOMEBODY'S BEATING THE HELL
OUT OF HER.

02:37.391 --> 02:38.326
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

02:38.359 --> 02:41.329
KIM FELL DOWN THE STAIRS.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.497
WHY DID THE SCHOOL
CALL THE POLICE?

02:43.531 --> 02:45.666
>> ACTUALLY,
KIM'S DOCTOR CALLED US.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.236
HE SAID THAT SHE'S BEEN INJURED
A LOT LATELY.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.671
>> OH, YOU MEAN
THE DISLOCATED SHOULDER?

02:50.704 --> 02:52.673
OH, THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
>> HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

02:52.706 --> 02:53.907
>> SHE GOT KNOCKED INTO A WALL

02:53.941 --> 02:55.676
PLAYING BASKETBALL...

02:55.709 --> 02:57.345
UM, BANGED UP HER FACE TOO.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.847
WE WERE LUCKY SHE DIDN'T NEED
A PLASTIC SURGEON.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.649
>> IS THAT
WHEN SHE BROKE HER RIBS?

03:01.682 --> 03:04.218
>> KIM DIDN'T BREAK ANY RIBS.

03:04.252 --> 03:06.520
>> WELL, X-RAYS SHOW
THAT SHE DID.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.223
THERE'S ALSO EVIDENCE
OF AN OLD HEAD INJURY.

03:09.257 --> 03:11.392
>> YOU'RE SAYING THAT SOMEONE
DID THIS TO MY BABY,

03:11.425 --> 03:13.361
AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT?

03:13.394 --> 03:15.396
>> WHY DIDN'T KIM TELL US?

03:15.429 --> 03:17.365
>> SHE'S ASHAMED...

03:17.398 --> 03:19.867
SCARED OF WHOEVER'S
BEEN HURTING HER.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.370
>> WHOEVER'S BEEN HURTING HER
BETTER BE SCARED OF ME.

03:22.403 --> 03:25.973
>> HAS, UH, KIM HAD
ANY PROBLEMS AT SCHOOL LATELY?

03:26.006 --> 03:27.375
>> HER--HER GRADES
SLIPPED THIS YEAR,

03:27.408 --> 03:28.542
FROM STRAIGHT As TO Bs.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.344
LIZ AND I HAVE BEEN ON HER
TO DROP A SPORT,

03:30.378 --> 03:32.546
CLEAN UP HER ACT.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.682
>> EVERYTHING OKAY AT HOME?
>> YEAH...

03:34.715 --> 03:37.351
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT
I'VE BEEN OUT OF WORK

03:37.385 --> 03:38.352
SINCE LAST FALL.

03:38.386 --> 03:42.556
>> WHAT'D YOU DO?
>> SENIOR V.P. AT LEHMAN.

03:42.590 --> 03:45.426
I GOT FIRED
BEFORE THE BANKRUPTCY...

03:45.459 --> 03:48.262
FOR OPENING MY MOUTH AND WARNING
THEM THAT WE WERE IN TROUBLE.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.431
>> BILL IS STILL VERY ANGRY,

03:50.464 --> 03:54.435
ESPECIALLY SINCE HE CAN'T FIND
ANOTHER JOB.

03:54.468 --> 03:57.571
>> ARE KIM
AND HER FATHER CLOSE?

03:57.605 --> 03:59.907
>> SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN
DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.709
>> BUT WITH YOUR HUSBAND
LOSING HIS JOB

04:01.742 --> 04:05.446
AND BEING VERY ANGRY...

04:05.479 --> 04:06.747
>> WHAT ARE YOU INSINUATING?

04:06.780 --> 04:09.750
>> ONLY THAT SOMETIMES
A VOLATILE SITUATION CAN--

04:09.783 --> 04:10.918
>> I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW,

04:10.951 --> 04:12.786
MY HUSBAND WOULDN'T LAY
A FINGER ON KIMMY.

04:12.820 --> 04:13.921
>> YOU THINK I HIT HER?

04:13.954 --> 04:15.423
>> LOOK, YOU'RE A GUY

04:15.456 --> 04:16.223
WHO USED TO HAVE
THE WORLD BY THE BALLS.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.691
YOU'RE OUT
POUNDING THE PAVEMENT.

04:17.725 --> 04:18.992
I'D BE ANGRY TOO.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.628
>> PAL, YOU BETTER THINK
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.297
>> WHAT I'M SAYING
IS I GOT TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, TOO,

04:23.331 --> 04:25.766
AND I KNOW HOW THEY CAN PUSH
YOUR BUTTONS.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.501
HMM?
STAY OUT LATE,

04:27.535 --> 04:28.336
DATE GUYS YOU DON'T LIKE.
>> STOP IT.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.670
>> THEN YOU TRY
AND TALK WITH THEM,

04:29.703 --> 04:30.738
ALL YOU GET BACK IS LIP.

04:30.771 --> 04:31.739
I'M LETTING YOU KNOW--

04:31.772 --> 04:33.374
>> STOP IT.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.443
>> LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
IF YOU COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE,

04:35.476 --> 04:36.610
AND YOU HIT HER.
>> STOP IT.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.913
[grunting]

04:39.947 --> 04:43.617
[breathing heavily]

04:43.651 --> 04:45.953
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.555
THAT'S NOT WHO I AM.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.457
>> IT'S OKAY.
I UNDERSTAND.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.392
JUST TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED TO KIMMY.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.093
>> WHAT KIND OF A FATHER AM I?
>> BILL?

04:53.126 --> 04:54.628
ARE YOU OKAY?

04:54.662 --> 04:57.498
>> WHY DO THEY THINK
THAT I HURT KIMMY?

04:57.531 --> 04:58.499
I DIDN'T TOUCH HER.

04:58.532 --> 04:59.467
I SWEAR I DIDN'T.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.470
I WILL TAKE
A LIE DETECTOR TEST, ANYTHING.

05:02.503 --> 05:05.806
>> WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT
WHO'S BEEN BEATING KIM.

05:05.839 --> 05:09.543
IS THERE SOMEONE SHE CONFIDES
IN--A TEACHER, A FRIEND?

05:11.379 --> 05:13.481
>> STEVE WALKER
IS HER BOYFRIEND.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.882
>> YOU DON'T SOUND TOO HAPPY
ABOUT THAT.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.718
>> WE THINK THEY SPEND
A LITTLE TOO MUCH TIME TOGETHER.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.554
>> YOU KNOW
WHERE WE CAN FIND HIM?

05:22.390 --> 05:23.524
>> I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL,

05:23.557 --> 05:25.359
BUT THEY SAID ONLY FAMILY
COULD SEE KIM.

05:25.393 --> 05:26.827
>> MM-HMM.
>> SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY, RIGHT?

05:26.860 --> 05:27.828
>> THE DOCTORS ARE HOPEFUL.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.830
>> HOW LONG HAVE YOU TWO
BEEN SEEING EACH OTHER?

05:29.863 --> 05:30.998
>> ABOUT A YEAR.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.533
WE WERE REALLY GOOD FRIENDS.

05:32.566 --> 05:35.669
SHE TUTORED ME IN MATH,
THEN, YOU KNOW...

05:35.703 --> 05:37.505
>> SHE EVER TALK
ABOUT HER PARENTS?

05:37.538 --> 05:39.540
>> THEY THINK
WE HANG OUT TOO MUCH.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.008
SUCKS,
'CAUSE WE ALWAYS GOT TO GO

05:41.041 --> 05:42.543
BACK TO MY PLACE
IF WE WANT TO--

05:42.576 --> 05:43.877
>> WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU WANTED TO?

05:43.911 --> 05:44.878
>> OVER THE WEEKEND.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.480
SHE SAID SHE COULDN'T

05:46.514 --> 05:47.581
'CAUSE SHE HAD TO GO
TO SOME WEDDING OR SOMETHING.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.817
>> HOW'D YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

05:49.850 --> 05:52.553
>> DO YOU THINK I HIT HER?

05:52.586 --> 05:54.388
>> SOMEBODY DID.
>> NO WAY.

05:54.422 --> 05:55.656
BUT A COUPLE MONTHS AGO,

05:55.689 --> 05:58.559
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO MESS AROUND
BECAUSE HER SHOULDER WAS F'd UP.

05:58.592 --> 05:59.727
AND I SAW BRUISES ON HER RIBS.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.562
>> SHE TELL YOU
HOW SHE GOT INJURED?

06:01.595 --> 06:03.697
>> SHE SAID
IT WAS IN HER BOXING CLASS.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.399
[coach's whistle blows]

06:05.433 --> 06:07.735
NO ONE'S SUPPOSED TO KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.773
>> I HAVE ONE CLASS
OF TEENAGE GIRLS,

06:12.806 --> 06:16.410
AND, UH, KIM'S THE BEST,
NEVER MISSED A SESSION.

06:16.444 --> 06:17.411
SOMETHING HAPPEN TO HER?

06:17.445 --> 06:19.413
>> SHE GOT HURT.
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW.

06:19.447 --> 06:20.548
>> HUH, ONE GUESS--

06:20.581 --> 06:23.417
A DIRTBAG NAMED RICK EDWARDS.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.018
>> DOES HE BOX HERE?
>> OH, YEAH.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.054
PUTS THE MOVES ON KIM...

06:27.087 --> 06:30.023
SHE BLOWS HIM OFF, BUT THEN, UH,
SHE'S JUMPING ROPE ONE DAY,

06:30.057 --> 06:30.891
AND HE TRIPS HER UP,

06:30.924 --> 06:33.193
SO I SUSPENDED HIS ASS
FOR SEVEN DAYS.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.496
>> HER PROBLEM GO AWAY?
>> TRY ONLY GOT WORSE.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.730
KIM WAS JUST IN HER ON FRIDAY.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.165
SHE SAID THE LOWLIFE
WAS BOTHERING HER AGAIN.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.434
>> ANY IDEA
WHERE WE CAN FIND HIM?

06:40.468 --> 06:42.603
>> OH, YEAH, HE WAS JUST--

06:42.636 --> 06:44.872
HEY, EDWARDS.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.440
GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE.

06:46.474 --> 06:47.675
>> WHAT YOU WANT, BITCH?

06:47.708 --> 06:50.444
>> PURE CHARM, HUH?
>> YEAH.

06:50.478 --> 06:51.745
HEY, PALLY,

06:51.779 --> 06:53.481
DO AS THE LADY SAYS, HUH?

06:53.514 --> 06:55.549
>> WHEN I'M DONE.

07:00.721 --> 07:03.156
GIVE ME A MINUTE.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.759
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

07:05.793 --> 07:07.661
>> YOU WITH KIM GARNET.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.597
>> THAT BITCH CALLED THE COPS?

07:09.630 --> 07:11.732
>> IS EVERY WOMAN
A BITCH TO YOU, MAN?

07:14.134 --> 07:15.603
>> CHEAP SHOT.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.672
>> OH, I THOUGHT
IT WAS A STREET FIGHT.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.475
>> ASSAULTING A COP,
TRESPASSING?

07:21.509 --> 07:22.543
YOU'RE TRIPPING.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.612
>> PAL, YOU'LL BE DOING LIFE
IF KIM GARNET DIES.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.113
>> DIES? WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:26.146 --> 07:27.781
>> FRIDAY,
YOU KICKED HER IN THE HEAD.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.483
>> I JUST TALKED TO HER.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.951
>> 'CAUSE YOU'RE A LOVER,
NOT A FIGHTER, HUH, CHAMP?

07:30.984 --> 07:32.185
>> EXACTLY.

07:32.219 --> 07:34.988
>> OH, WHO'S MY
MAIN MAN'S BUNKMATE HERE?

07:35.022 --> 07:37.491
>> OH, THIS IS LITTLE PETE.

07:37.525 --> 07:40.494
HE RAPED A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.496
>> HI, THERE.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.498
>> WAIT, YOU--YOU CAN'T LOCK ME
UP WITH A PERVERT.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.534
>> WHY?
HE LOOKS LIKE A LOVER TOO.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.636
>> HEY, PLAY NICE WITH HIM,
LITTLE PETE.

07:48.669 --> 07:49.803
>> REAL NICE.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.805
>> NO!
I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING.

07:51.839 --> 07:54.642
LAST WEEK I WAITED
OUTSIDE THE GYM FOR HER.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.743
I TRIED TO APOLOGIZE.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.144
SHE WOULDN'T GIVE ME
THE TIME OF DAY.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.647
I WANTED TO THROTTLE HER,
BUT I DIDN'T, I SWEAR.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.683
>> YOU REALLY WANT TO PUT
THE SCREWS TO HIM,

08:02.716 --> 08:04.818
MAKE HIM GO TEN ROUNDS
WITH YOU-KNOW-WHO.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.119
>> THE TALK-TOO-MUCH TECH.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.922
>> YEAH.
YOU GO SAVE THE CAPTAIN.

08:08.956 --> 08:11.158
I'LL LOCK UP ROCKY DOWNSTAIRS.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.727
>> HEY, HEY, THE EL-STER.
HOW'S IT HANGING?

08:13.761 --> 08:14.562
>> WHAT DO YOU GOT, STUCKEY?

08:14.595 --> 08:16.530
>> UH, AN UPDATED 411
ON THE STUFF

08:16.564 --> 08:19.099
THAT I PULLED OUT OF
KIM GARNET'S SCHOOL LOCKER.

08:19.132 --> 08:21.101
>> WHICH HE NEGLECTED TO FORWARD
TO TARU AS INSTRUCTED.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.003
>> WELL, YEAH, I TOOK A LITTLE
PEEKABOO MYSELF,

08:23.036 --> 08:25.673
AND I FIGURED YOU'D WANT TO TAKE
A LOOK AT WHAT WAS ON HERE ASAP.

08:25.706 --> 08:28.175
YOU VICTIM HAS BEEN SEXTING.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.177
>> SEXTING?
>> YEAH, SENDING NUDE PHOTOS

08:30.210 --> 08:31.679
OF HERSELF ON HER CELL PHONE.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.981
I MEAN, THIS GIRL
IS SMOKIN' HOT.

08:34.014 --> 08:37.551
>> CAN I HAVE THE PHONE?

08:37.585 --> 08:38.719
"I LUV U."

08:38.752 --> 08:40.020
>> YEAH,
AND THERE'S LOTS MORE--

08:40.053 --> 08:41.855
UH, FULL-FRONTAL,
CLOSE-UPS OF STUFF.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.291
AND JUDGING BY THE AMOUNT
OF HATE MAIL KIM GOT,

08:44.324 --> 08:46.694
I'D SAY SOMEONE PROBABLY VIRALED
THOSE PICS TO HER WHOLE SCHOOL.

08:46.727 --> 08:47.728
>> DO YOU THINK SPEEDO STEVE

08:47.761 --> 08:49.697
COULD SEND OUT NUDE PICTURES
OF HIS GIRLFRIEND?

08:49.730 --> 08:51.765
>> WELL, ANYONE WITH ACCESS
TO HER PHONE COULD'VE DONE IT.

08:51.799 --> 08:52.600
I MEAN, GRAB IT FROM HER LOCKER,

08:52.633 --> 08:53.734
TAKE IT WHILE
SHE WASN'T LOOKING.

08:53.767 --> 08:58.205
>> WELL, SOMEONE WASN'T
TOO HAPPY TO BE GETTING THIS.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.574
"UR GONNA DIE."

09:00.608 --> 09:02.776
WHO SENT THAT TEXT?

09:06.614 --> 09:07.781
>> SHE DID.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.583
>> WHAT?

09:09.617 --> 09:12.920
>> THE TEXT CAME
FROM HER NUMBER.

09:14.254 --> 09:18.091
>> WHY WOULD SHE SEND
A DEATH THREAT TO HERSELF?

09:26.366 --> 09:28.235
>> I DON'T THINK KIM SENT
HERSELF THIS DEATH THREAT.

09:28.268 --> 09:29.603
>> IT'S HER CELL NUMBER.

09:29.637 --> 09:30.604
>> BUT I CAN'T FIND ANY RECORD

09:30.638 --> 09:32.239
ON HER CELL PHONE BILL
THAT SHE SENT THE TEXT.

09:32.272 --> 09:35.075
>> THEN WHY'S HER NUMBER ON IT?
>> WHAT ABOUT SPOOFING?

09:35.108 --> 09:36.076
>> WHAT'S THAT?

09:36.109 --> 09:38.245
>> DELIBERATELY FAKING
A CALLER I.D. NUMBER.

09:38.278 --> 09:42.249
>> UH, EL, YOU MIND JOTTING DOWN
YOUR MOBILE NUMBER FOR ME?

09:42.282 --> 09:45.819
>> YOU SEXT ME, STUCKEY,
YOU'RE TOAST.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.889
>> "FONEFAKE.COM"?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.257
>> YEAH, I JUST ENTER IN

09:50.290 --> 09:52.125
THE NUMBER
THAT I WANT TO CALL, ELLIOT'S,

09:52.159 --> 09:55.362
AND THE NUMBER THAT I WANT TO
APPEAR AS THE CALLER I.D.,

09:55.395 --> 09:57.230
ALSO ELLIOT'S, AND THEN...

09:57.264 --> 09:58.866
BING, BANG, BONG.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.902
[cell phone ringing]

10:03.136 --> 10:04.838
>> I'LL BE DAMNED.
I JUST CALLED MYSELF.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.373
>> YEAH.
UH, FONEFAKE LETS YOU

10:06.406 --> 10:08.642
CHANGE THE SOUND OF YOUR VOICE,
RECORD CONVERSATIONS,

10:08.676 --> 10:10.110
AND SEND TEXTS ANONYMOUSLY.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.344
>> AND THIS IS LEGAL?

10:11.378 --> 10:13.313
>> WELL, I MEAN,
NO ONE'S SHUT THEM DOWN YET.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.282
>> SO HOW DO WE TRACE
THE DEATH THREAT?

10:15.315 --> 10:16.416
>> SEE, THEREIN
LIES THE RUB, CAP.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.951
I MEAN,
THERE'S GOT TO BE A DOZEN

10:17.985 --> 10:19.787
OF THESE SPOOFING SITES ONLINE.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.288
>> WELL, NO JUDGE
IS GONNA GIVE US A SUBPOENA

10:21.321 --> 10:22.723
FOR EVERY ONE OF THEM.

10:22.756 --> 10:23.523
>> YEAH, IN OTHER WORDS,

10:23.556 --> 10:24.792
STUCKEY'S WASTING
OUR TIME AGAIN.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.794
BUT IF WE WORK THE OTHER WAY...

10:26.827 --> 10:28.796
WE CAN FIND OUT
WHO SHE INITIALLY SENT

10:28.829 --> 10:30.731
THE NAKED PHOTOS TO.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.666
HERE'S HER TEXTS
FROM LAST WEEK.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.968
>> WELL, THERE YOU GO--
STEVE WALKER, HER BOYFRIEND.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.169
>> NOT NECESSARILY.

10:36.203 --> 10:39.807
ACCORDING TO HER CELL PHONE
BILL, SHE FIRST TEXTED THEM

10:39.840 --> 10:41.174
TO AN ETHAN MORSE.

10:41.208 --> 10:44.244
>> WHO'S ETHAN MORSE?

10:44.277 --> 10:45.412
>> HIS CELL PHONE BILLS

10:45.445 --> 10:47.748
TO AN ADDRESS IN LITTLE NECK.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.116
>> [exhales sharply]
GUESS I'M GOING TO QUEENS.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.784
>> ACTUALLY,
I CAN SAVE YOU A TRIP.

10:50.818 --> 10:53.887
ETHAN'S IN MANHATTAN.
I GOOGLED HIM.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.823
TRY GRANDVIEW PREP.

10:55.856 --> 10:58.458
ETHAN GOT GREAT REVIEWS
IN OKLAHOMA LAST FALL.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.694
HE'S THE STAR
OF THEIR THEATER PROGRAM.

11:03.363 --> 11:07.334
>> HEY, YOU TWO, UH,
WANTED TO SEE ME?

11:07.367 --> 11:10.003
LET ME GUESS--YOU'RE
FROM WILLIAM MORRIS, RIGHT?

11:10.037 --> 11:11.338
HERE TO GIVE ME MY BIG BREAK?

11:11.371 --> 11:12.840
>> OH, WE'RE NOT
THAT KIND OF AGENT.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.776
WE HAVE QUESTIONS
ABOUT KIM GARNET.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.344
>> [chuckles]
KIM? WHY?

11:17.377 --> 11:19.046
I DIDN'T PUSH HER
DOWN THE STAIRS.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.781
>> NOBODY SAID YOU DID.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.182
>> OKAY, I'M SORRY.

11:22.215 --> 11:25.018
UH, HOW CAN I HELP YOU,
OFFICERS?

11:25.052 --> 11:27.755
>> HOW WELL YOU KNOW KIM?
>> WE'RE FRIENDS.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.489
>> FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS?

11:29.522 --> 11:30.457
>> COME ON...
[chuckles]

11:30.490 --> 11:33.026
EVERYBODY IN THE SCHOOL
GOT THOSE PICTURES.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.728
>> YEAH, BUT KIM SENT THEM
TO YOU FIRST.

11:34.762 --> 11:35.929
WHY?

11:35.963 --> 11:38.365
>> SHE MEANT TO SEND THEM
TO STEVE WALKER, HER BOYFRIEND.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.900
I-I-IT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.202
>> NO, TRIPPING
IN THE HALLWAY'S AN ACCIDENT,

11:42.235 --> 11:44.504
NOT ENDING UP SPREAD-EAGLE
IN THE YEARBOOK.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.506
>> LOOK, GUYS,

11:46.539 --> 11:49.509
I WISH KIM WANTED TO BE
MORE THAN FRIENDS,

11:49.542 --> 11:52.279
BUT LET'S FACE IT,
I'M A DRAMA GEEK.

11:52.312 --> 11:55.382
HOT GIRLS DON'T REALLY GO
FOR DRAMA GEEKS.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.751
>> PLACES, EVERYONE.
>> SORRY.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.454
>> HEY, I GOT
ONE LAST QUESTION FOR YOU.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.223
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW KIM?

12:03.256 --> 12:05.058
>> MONDAY AFTER FIRST BELL,

12:05.092 --> 12:06.827
BEFORE SHE GOT HURT.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.397
>> EL, THAT KID ETHAN

12:10.430 --> 12:12.065
ISN'T TELLING US EVERYTHING.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.401
KIM WAS IN HIS PART
OF TOWN FRIDAY NIGHT.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.536
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
>> TARU CHECKED HER CELL PHONE.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.772
WHEN SHE SENT THIS
TO HER BOYFRIEND,

12:18.806 --> 12:22.209
THE SIGNAL BOUNCED OFF A TOWER
THREE BLOCKS FROM ETHAN'S HOUSE.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.343
>> SO KIM WAS HANGING OUT
WITH ETHAN

12:23.376 --> 12:25.245
WHILE SHE WAS SEXTING
DIRTY PICTURES TO SPEEDO STEVE.

12:25.278 --> 12:28.148
>> THERE'S MORE.
ETHAN'S GOT HIMSELF A TEMPER.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.784
>> SUSPENDED TWICE
FOR STARTING FIGHTS.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.419
KICKED A STUDENT IN THE HEAD.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.254
HOW'D YOU GET
ETHAN'S SCHOOL RECORDS?

12:34.287 --> 12:35.923
>> I GOT IT FROM ONE
OF MY RETIRED BUDDIES.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.557
HE'S HEAD OF SECURITY
AT GRANDVIEW PREP.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.392
SLIPPED IT TO ME
ON THE DOWN-LOW.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.627
>> SLIP THEM BACK.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.797
YOU GOT THEM WITHOUT A SUBPOENA,
SO FOR ME, THEY DON'T EXIST.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.799
>> SAMANTHA COPELAND
FROM CORP. COUNSEL,

12:45.833 --> 12:47.400
DETECTIVES STABLER AND TUTUOLA.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.401
>> CALL ME SAM.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.803
>> OKAY, WELL...
[clears throat]

12:49.837 --> 12:50.938
ETHAN MORSE IS A JUVENILE.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.406
YOU GONNA PROSECUTE HIM
IN FAMILY COURT?

12:53.440 --> 12:54.341
>> IF IT EVER MAKES IT THERE.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.276
YOU GOT ANY EVIDENCE
I CAN ACTUALLY USE?

12:56.309 --> 12:58.545
>> WE KNOW IT'S CIRCUMSTANTIAL,
BUT IT'S SOLID.

12:58.578 --> 12:59.947
IT ALL POINTS TO ETHAN.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.815
>> ETHAN'S THE BOYFRIEND
OF YOUR VICTIM?

13:01.849 --> 13:03.283
>> NO, SWIMMER STEVE
IS HER GUY,

13:03.316 --> 13:06.453
AND, UH, DRAMA BOY ETHAN
ADMITS HE'S HAD HIS EYE ON HER.

13:06.486 --> 13:07.821
>> HERE'S HOW IT WENT DOWN.

13:07.855 --> 13:10.223
KIM TOOK HER TUMBLE IN SCHOOL
ON MONDAY,

13:10.257 --> 13:11.591
BUT HER DOCTOR SAYS
SOMEONE SMACKED HER AROUND

13:11.624 --> 13:13.961
A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.528
>> WHICH MEANS FRIDAY
OR SATURDAY.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.297
NOW, WE KNOW THAT SHE WAS HOME
ALL DAY SATURDAY,

13:17.330 --> 13:20.033
AND SHE WAS IN SCHOOL
ALL DAY FRIDAY UNTIL 4:00 P.M.

13:20.067 --> 13:22.469
>> SO SHE MUST'VE BEEN ATTACKED
ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

13:22.502 --> 13:23.971
>> WHEN SHE WENT OUT
TO LITTLE NECK.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.605
>> WHICH IS ETHAN MORSE'S TURF,

13:25.638 --> 13:27.975
SO HE HAD TO BE WHO GAVE HER
THE BEAT-DOWN.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.577
>> OKAY, WHAT'S HIS MOTIVE?
>> KID'S GOT A CRUSH ON HER.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.846
KIM SENDS HIM DIRTY PICTURES
OF HERSELF.

13:32.880 --> 13:33.947
HE THINKS SHE WANTS TO BE
MORE THAN FRIENDS.

13:33.981 --> 13:36.149
HE INVITES HER OVER,
THINKING HE'S GONNA GET LAID.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.417
>> BUT WHEN SHE GETS
TO LITTLE NECK,

13:37.450 --> 13:39.853
SHE SAYS
SHE SEXTED HIM BY MISTAKE,

13:39.887 --> 13:40.988
AND HE GOES BALLISTIC ON HER.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.156
>> UNLESS IT WASN'T A MISTAKE

13:43.190 --> 13:46.159
AND SHE WAS DATING ETHAN
BEHIND STEVE'S BACK.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.560
THIS IS VIDEO SURVEILLANCE

13:47.594 --> 13:50.597
FROM THE TICKET BOOTH
AT PENN STATION.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.565
>> OKAY, SO WE GOT KIM,
FRIDAY NIGHT,

13:52.599 --> 13:53.466
6:28 P.M.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.304
>> OKAY, WINDOW 7.
CHECK OUT WINDOW 12.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.972
>> STEVE WALKER.
WHERE WAS HE GOING?

13:59.006 --> 14:00.207
>> LITTLE NECK.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.574
USED DADDY'S CREDIT CARD
THREE MINUTES AFTER KIM.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.176
>> HE'S STALKING
HIS GIRLFRIEND.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.512
>> STEVE FOLLOWED HER
TO A RENDEZVOUS IN QUEENS,

14:05.545 --> 14:08.982
WAITED FOR HER TO LEAVE ETHAN,
AND THEN HE BEAT HER UP.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.650
>> OR ETHAN GETS PISSED
WHEN HE SPOTTED STEVE,

14:10.683 --> 14:13.153
WAITED TILL HE GOT HER ALONE,
AND WAILED ON HER.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.523
>> TIME TO GET THEM IN HERE,
FIND OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.191
>> I WASN'T STALKING KIM.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.193
>> YOU JUST HAPPENED TO BUY
A TRAIN TICKET TO LITTLE NECK

14:20.227 --> 14:21.528
THREE MINUTES AFTER SHE DID.

14:21.561 --> 14:24.531
>> KIM ASKED ME TO GO WITH HER,
TO PROTECT HER.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.900
>> FROM ETHAN?
>> YEAH.

14:26.934 --> 14:29.536
SHE WAS AFRAID OF WHAT
HE WOULD DO WHEN SHE TOLD HIM.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.038
>> TOLD HIM WHAT?

14:31.071 --> 14:32.906
>> THAT SHE JUST WANTED
TO BE FRIENDS.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.674
SHE DIDN'T LIKE ME,
YOU KNOW, LIKE THAT.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.044
>> WELL, KIM KNEW
YOU HAD A CRUSH ON HER.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.478
>> YEAH.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.214
YEAH, THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT
SHE SENT ME THE PICTURES.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.916
>> YOU GOT ANGRY
WHEN SHE BLEW YOU OFF?

14:42.950 --> 14:44.217
>> WHAT ARE YOU ACCUSING
MY SON OF?

14:44.251 --> 14:45.919
>> MRS. MORSE,
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT

14:45.953 --> 14:49.256
HOW YOUR SON'S FRIEND
ENDED UP IN A COMA.

14:49.289 --> 14:51.224
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
HANGING OUT WITH HER?

14:51.258 --> 14:53.393
>> SINCE SCHOOL STARTED
IN SEPTEMBER.

14:53.426 --> 14:56.063
>> KIM'S PREVIOUS HEAD INJURY
HAPPENED IN SEPTEMBER.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.931
>> SO IF KIM
WAS GONNA TELL ETHAN

14:57.965 --> 14:59.232
SHE WASN'T INTERESTED
IN ANYTHING MORE,

14:59.266 --> 15:02.235
SHE WOULD NEED
STEVE'S PROTECTION.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.570
>> I'M TELLING YOU,

15:03.603 --> 15:06.573
MY SON'S NEVER DONE
A VIOLENT THING IN HIS LIFE.

15:06.606 --> 15:09.242
BUT THAT MORSE KID
IS OUT OF CONTROL.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.711
YOU SAID HE WAS SUSPENDED TWICE,
RIGHT, SON?

15:11.744 --> 15:13.713
>> THAT'S WHY I WENT WITH HER
TO LITTLE NECK.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.148
I WANTED HER TO BE SAFE.

15:15.182 --> 15:18.085
>> BUT YOU USED
A SEPARATE TICKET BOOTH.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.586
>> IT WAS KIM'S IDEA,

15:19.619 --> 15:21.955
SO ETHAN WOULDN'T SEE ME WITH
HER IN CASE HE WAS ON THE TRAIN.

15:21.989 --> 15:22.755
>> OKAY, NOW, WERE YOU AWARE

15:22.789 --> 15:24.724
THAT, UH, KIM SENT THIS
TO ETHAN?

15:24.757 --> 15:28.028
>> BY ACCIDENT. SHE SAID
SHE MEANT TO SEND IT TO ME.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.963
>> BUT YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE HER,
BECAUSE YOU SENT HER THIS.

15:29.997 --> 15:32.099
>> LOOK, I SWEAR I DIDN'T.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.001
>> SURE YOU DID--
FRIDAY NIGHT,

15:34.034 --> 15:37.170
RIGHT AFTER KIM TOLD YOU
SHE ONLY WANTED TO BE FRIENDS.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.972
>> I WAS BUMMED.
I WASN'T ANGRY.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.273
>> THAT'S BULL.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.442
YOU GOT PISSED, YOU KICKED
THE CRAP OUT OF HER,

15:42.475 --> 15:44.511
THEN YOU SENT HER
THE DEATH THREAT.

15:44.544 --> 15:45.979
>> NO! OKAY?!
YOU'RE WRONG!

15:46.013 --> 15:47.447
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE!
I DIDN'T HURT KIM!

15:47.480 --> 15:49.316
>> YOU FOLLOWED HER
TO LITTLE NECK.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.651
YOU SAW HER WITH ETHAN,
AND YOU TAUGHT HER A LESSON.

15:51.684 --> 15:52.885
>> NO, I LOVE HER!

15:52.919 --> 15:54.621
>> THEN YOU TEXTED HER NUDIE
PICTURES TO THE ENTIRE SCHOOL.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.289
>> YOU SPOOFED YOUR CALLER I.D.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.758
TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE KIM SENT THOSE PHOTOS.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.460
>> SPOOFED?

16:00.493 --> 16:02.295
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.464
>> YOU'RE A BATTERER
WITH A BAD TEMPER.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.599
DOES BEATING UP GIRLS
MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE A BIG MAN?

16:06.633 --> 16:08.635
>> THAT'S ENOUGH!

16:08.668 --> 16:10.737
WE ARE NOT ANSWERING
ANY MORE QUESTIONS...

16:10.770 --> 16:12.772
>> WITHOUT A LAWYER PRESENT.

16:12.805 --> 16:13.773
I KNOW OUR RIGHTS.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.308
YOU CAN'T HOLD MY SON

16:15.342 --> 16:16.643
WITHOUT PROOF.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.778
WE'RE GOING HOME.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.148
>> YOU GONNA LET THIS HAPPEN?

16:21.181 --> 16:23.616
>> [sighs]
CUT THEM LOOSE.

16:25.685 --> 16:28.355
>> WHERE'S ETHAN?
>> MAKING A PIT STOP.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.491
[door slams]
>> HEY!

16:31.524 --> 16:33.260
WHAT DID YOU DO TO KIM?!

16:33.293 --> 16:34.761
>> ETHAN, GET BACK HERE!
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

16:34.794 --> 16:37.097
>> SAVED HER FROM YOU,
DRAMA QUEEN.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.665
YOU SEE WHY KIM WAS SCARED?
HE'S CRAZY.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.167
>> THAT BOY ATTACKED MY SON.
YOU SAW IT.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.402
>> YOU'RE GONNA PAY
FOR WHAT YOU DID, MAN.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.504
>> I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, DAD.
>> THE HOSPITAL JUST CALLED.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.639
KIM'S AWAKE.
>> YOU'RE DEAD NOW, ASSWIPE.

16:46.673 --> 16:49.342
>> FIN, ELLIOT, ESCORT
THESE BOYS OUT OF THE BUILDING.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.578
>> THIS WAY.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.046
>> LET'S GO TALK TO KIM,

16:53.080 --> 16:55.382
GET HER TO SETTLE THIS
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.355
>> I WAS SPRINTING IN THE PARK
WHEN I TRIPPED OVER A ROCK.

17:02.389 --> 17:03.823
I FELL AND HIT MY HEAD.
>> HONEY...

17:03.856 --> 17:06.693
>> YOU PROMISED
TO TELL THE TRUTH.

17:06.726 --> 17:10.363
>> I AM TELLING THE TRUTH.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.065
>> ARE YOU AFRAID OF SOMEONE?

17:12.099 --> 17:14.067
BECAUSE WE CAN PROTECT YOU.

17:14.101 --> 17:17.204
I'LL GET A RESTRAINING ORDER.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.706
>> I DON'T NEED ONE.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.075
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

17:22.109 --> 17:22.942
>> WERE YOUR BROKEN RIBS

17:22.975 --> 17:25.078
AND DISLOCATED SHOULDER
ACCIDENTS TOO?

17:25.112 --> 17:27.580
>> YES.

17:27.614 --> 17:30.183
>> KIM, WE KNOW YOU WENT TO SEE
ETHAN ON FRIDAY.

17:30.217 --> 17:33.253
WE ALSO KNOW
THAT YOU SENT BOTH BOYS

17:33.286 --> 17:36.089
NUDE PICTURES OF YOURSELF.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.857
>> YOU DID WHAT?

17:37.890 --> 17:39.726
WHAT IN GOD'S NAME
WERE YOU THINKING?

17:39.759 --> 17:40.860
>> SWEETHEART,
ONCE THESE GET OUT THERE,

17:40.893 --> 17:42.229
THERE'S NO GETTING THEM BACK.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.530
>> I'M SORRY.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.531
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.866
>> IT'S A BIGGER MISTAKE
TO PROTECT YOUR ABUSER,

17:46.899 --> 17:48.101
WHOEVER HE IS.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.869
>> KIM, HE'S NOT GONNA STOP.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.105
WHAT HE DID TO YOU IS NOT LOVE.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.740
>> YOU THINK THESE PICTURES
MADE HIM ANGRY?

17:53.773 --> 17:55.142
ONE DAY HE'S GONNA GO TOO FAR

17:55.175 --> 17:56.876
AND KILL YOU.

17:56.909 --> 17:57.910
>> YOU'LL BE SAYING GOOD-BYE

17:57.944 --> 18:00.547
TO YOUR DAUGHTER ON A SLAB
IN THE CITY MORGUE.

18:00.580 --> 18:04.384
>> EXCUSE US. EXCUSE US
FOR ONE SECOND, PLEASE.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.752
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THAT GIRL IS A VICTIM.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.320
BROWBEATING HER
IS NOT THE ANSWER.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.756
>> THEN WE'LL ARREST HER.
>> ARREST HER? FOR WHAT?

18:09.789 --> 18:12.625
>> POSSESSION AND DISTRIBUTION
OF KIDDIE PORN.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.427
COUPLE DAYS IN JAIL,
SHE'LL TURN AROUND.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.196
>> ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

18:16.229 --> 18:17.130
>> THAT GIRL BROKE THE LAW

18:17.164 --> 18:18.198
WHEN SHE SENT NAKED PICTURES
OF HERSELF.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.633
>> I'M NOT COLLARING A VICTIM
TO MAKE HER TALK.

18:20.667 --> 18:24.137
>> ARREST HER, OR I'LL FIND
SOMEONE WHO WILL.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.605
AND I'LL REPORT YOU
TO INTERNAL AFFAIRS

18:25.638 --> 18:27.440
FOR FAILURE
TO TAKE POLICE ACTION.

18:33.646 --> 18:36.216
>> KIM GARNET,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.285
>> YOU CAN'T ARREST HER.
>> SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.287
>> SHE PRODUCED
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.155
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.256
ANYTHING YOU SAY

18:43.290 --> 18:45.158
CAN AND WILL BE USED
AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF LAW.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.092
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY...

18:46.125 --> 18:48.161
>> [crying] WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS TO ME?

18:48.195 --> 18:49.196
I THOUGHT
YOU WANTED TO HELP ME.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.530
>> DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THESE RIGHTS

18:50.563 --> 18:52.265
AS I HAVE EXPLAINED THEM
TO YOU?

19:03.210 --> 19:05.178
>> HOW LOW CAN YOU GET,
SAMANTHA?

19:05.212 --> 19:07.480
WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO THIS GIRL
IS REPUGNANT.

19:07.514 --> 19:08.815
>> I'M TRYING
TO SAVE KIM'S LIFE.

19:08.848 --> 19:09.882
>> BY PUTTING ME IN JAIL?

19:09.916 --> 19:11.651
>> IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.254
>> KIMBERLY
HASN'T COMMITTED A CRIME.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.722
THIS CHARGE
IS A TRANSPARENT PLOY

19:15.755 --> 19:17.890
TO INTIMIDATE HER
INTO NAMING HER ABUSER.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.226
>> DATING VIOLENCE IN THIS CITY

19:19.259 --> 19:21.194
IS UP NEARLY 50%
IN THE LAST DECADE.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.094
I AM NOT ABOUT

19:22.128 --> 19:24.231
TO LET ANOTHER GIRL
GET VICTIMIZED...

19:24.264 --> 19:25.732
OR MURDERED.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.268
IF YOUR CLIENT COOPERATES,
I'LL DROP THE CHARGES.

19:28.301 --> 19:31.404
>> BLACKMAILING HER ISN'T GONNA
GET HER TO COOPERATE.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.973
>> KIM, YOU WILL NOT BE SAFE

19:34.006 --> 19:36.743
UNTIL HE'S LOCKED UP.

19:36.776 --> 19:39.579
KIM...

19:39.612 --> 19:41.614
PLEASE.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.619
>> SEE YOU AT TRIAL.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.297
>> TO PARAPHRASE
JUSTICE STEWART,

19:57.330 --> 19:59.299
I CAN'T DEFINE
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY,

19:59.332 --> 20:01.268
BUT I KNOW IT WHEN I SEE IT.

20:01.301 --> 20:04.271
AND THIS SURE LOOKS
LIKE KIDDIE PORN, MS. POND.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.439
>> THE RESPONDENT TOOK THESE
PHOTOS OF HERSELF, YOUR HONOR.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.275
>> THE RESPONDENT
IS LYING NAKED IN BED,

20:08.308 --> 20:10.277
POSED IN A LEWD
AND LASCIVIOUS MANNER.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.344
THESE PICTURES

20:11.378 --> 20:13.613
ARE CLEARLY INTENDED
TO ELICIT A SEXUAL RESPONSE.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.948
BASED ON THE PEOPLE V. BIMONTE,
THAT IS KIDDIE PORN.

20:15.982 --> 20:17.617
>> OUR LAWS WERE PASSED
TO PROTECT CHILDREN.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.652
KIMBERLY GARNET IS A MEMBER
OF THAT PROTECTED CLASS,

20:19.686 --> 20:20.787
NOT A PERPETRATOR.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.756
>> IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THESE PICTURES

20:23.790 --> 20:25.458
END UP ON THE INTERNET
IN THE HANDS OF A PEDOPHILE.

20:25.492 --> 20:27.494
SHE DISTRIBUTED THEM.
SHE'S CULPABLE.

20:27.527 --> 20:28.895
>> SHE DIDN'T INTEND
TO DISTRIBUTE THEM.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.797
>> JUST A MOMENT.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.031
DETECTIVE BENSON,

20:32.064 --> 20:34.734
YOU'RE THE ARRESTING OFFICER.

20:34.767 --> 20:35.968
DO YOU BELIEVE MS. GARNET

20:36.002 --> 20:38.338
DISTRIBUTED AND PRODUCED
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY?

20:40.340 --> 20:43.310
>> BY THE LETTER OF THE LAW,
YES, YOUR HONOR.

20:43.343 --> 20:46.846
BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE
THAT THAT WAS HER INTENT.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.316
>> THANK YOU FOR HONESTY.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.351
>> BASED ON DETECTIVE BENSON'S
STATEMENT,

20:51.384 --> 20:52.619
I'M MOVING TO DISMISS
THE CHARGES.

20:52.652 --> 20:55.988
>> NOT SO FAST, MS. POND.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.089
TOO MANY TEENAGE GIRLS

20:57.123 --> 21:00.327
ARE TEXTING OR POSTING
NUDE PICTURES OF THEMSELVES

21:00.360 --> 21:01.828
WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST REGARD

21:01.861 --> 21:04.030
FOR THE SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS
OF THEIR ACTIONS.

21:04.063 --> 21:07.066
WE HAVE AN EPIDEMIC
ON OUR HANDS...

21:07.099 --> 21:09.502
AND IT'S TIME
TO SEND A MESSAGE--

21:09.536 --> 21:11.371
ENOUGH.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.373
THE EVIDENCE HERE
IS MORE THAN ENOUGH

21:13.406 --> 21:16.042
TO PROCEED TO TRIAL.

21:16.075 --> 21:18.345
>> DETECTIVE.
>> THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.846
>> YOU DID PLENTY IN CHAMBERS.
[cell phone ringing]

21:19.879 --> 21:21.681
I KNOW YOU DON'T AGREE
WITH WHAT COPELAND'S DOING.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.516
>> LOOK, IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS.

21:23.550 --> 21:25.017
BENSON.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.686
WHAT?

21:26.719 --> 21:28.521
I'M ON MY WAY.

21:28.555 --> 21:31.558
COUNSELOR,
YOU'D BETTER COME WITH ME.

21:31.591 --> 21:32.692
>> HOW BAD?

21:32.725 --> 21:34.361
>> COMPOUND FRACTURE
OF THE LEFT ULNA,

21:34.394 --> 21:36.028
LACERATIONS AND BRUISES
TO HER FACE.

21:36.062 --> 21:38.698
>> KIDS DATING IS SUPPOSED TO BE
WHAT COLOR PROM DRESS TO WEAR,

21:38.731 --> 21:40.032
NOT A TRIP TO THE E.R.

21:40.066 --> 21:41.701
>> UNFORTUNATELY,
I SEE IT TOO OFTEN.

21:41.734 --> 21:44.036
ONE IN TEN TEENS IS
PHYSICALLY ABUSED BY A PARTNER.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.705
>> DID SHE TELL YOU
HOW IT HAPPENED?

21:45.738 --> 21:48.074
>> YEAH, AND I DON'T BELIEVE HER
FOR A SECOND.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.379
>> OH, MY GOD.

21:52.412 --> 21:53.346
>> IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

21:53.380 --> 21:56.549
>> [sighs] TELL THEM
THE TRUTH, KIM, PLEASE.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.385
>> I FELL OFF MY SKATEBOARD.

21:58.418 --> 21:59.486
>> PLEASE...

21:59.519 --> 22:00.953
LET THEM HELP YOU.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.089
>> [scoffs]
SHE ARRESTED ME.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.557
HOW IS THAT HELPING ME?

22:04.591 --> 22:07.427
>> DETECTIVE BENSON STOOD UP
FOR YOU IN COURT.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.529
KIMBERLY, YOU CAN'T LET HIM
DO THIS TO YOU ANYMORE.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.598
>> NOW SHE'S ON HER SIDE.
>> KIM...

22:11.631 --> 22:13.466
WE ARE ALL ON YOUR SIDE.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.001
>> THEN LEAVE ME ALONE.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.103
>> I CAN'T DO THAT.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.538
>> GET OUT.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.139
>> KIM.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.809
>> I WANT HER OUT OF HERE NOW!

22:34.421 --> 22:35.755
>> HOW'S KIM?

22:35.788 --> 22:37.757
>> THEY'RE KEEPING HER OVERNIGHT
FOR OBSERVATION,

22:37.790 --> 22:39.158
AND IF EVERYTHING'S OKAY,

22:39.191 --> 22:41.828
THEY'LL SEND HER HOME TOMORROW
AND CLEAR HER FOR COURT.

22:44.464 --> 22:47.099
>> I HEARD YOU SANDBAGGED
THE PROSECUTOR TODAY.

22:47.133 --> 22:50.102
>> COPELAND
GOT WHAT SHE WANTED.

22:50.136 --> 22:51.538
>> WHICH DOESN'T GIVE YOU
LICENSE TO DEFECT

22:51.571 --> 22:52.739
TO THE DEFENSE.

22:52.772 --> 22:54.441
>> WE'RE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT
THE VICTIMS,

22:54.474 --> 22:56.042
NOT THROW THE BOOK AT THEM.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.444
>> KIM GARNET
COMMITTED A CRIME.

22:57.477 --> 22:58.945
>> HOW IS SENDING
NAKED PICTURES

22:58.978 --> 23:00.980
TO TWO BOYS HER OWN AGE
KIDDIE PORN?

23:01.013 --> 23:03.716
>> THE LAW HASN'T CAUGHT UP
WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.785
>> AND WE ARE CRIMINALIZING
PRIVATE BEHAVIOR.

23:05.818 --> 23:09.556
>> IT IS NOT PRIVATE
WHEN THESE KIDS BEGIN SEXTING.

23:09.589 --> 23:12.992
COLLEGE ADMISSIONS OFFICERS,
FUTURE EMPLOYERS,

23:13.025 --> 23:15.628
EVEN THEIR OWN CHILDREN MIGHT
SEE THESE PICTURES ONE DAY.

23:15.662 --> 23:18.498
THEY DON'T REALIZE THE
CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.467
>> SO SHE MADE
A STUPID DECISION,

23:20.500 --> 23:21.968
BUT SHE SHOULDN'T GO TO JAIL

23:22.001 --> 23:24.904
OR BE LABELED A SEX OFFENDER
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.506
>> IT'S NOT UP TO YOU.

23:26.539 --> 23:28.541
IT'S UP TO THE JUDGE.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.150
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL, KIMBERLY,

23:38.184 --> 23:40.653
KNOWING THAT THE ENTIRE SCHOOL

23:40.687 --> 23:43.523
HAS SEEN YOU NAKED?

23:43.556 --> 23:44.991
>> ASHAMED.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.493
I CAN BARELY GET
THROUGH THE DAY

23:46.526 --> 23:48.995
WITHOUT KIDS POINTING AT ME
AND WHISPERING.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.162
>> DID YOU TEXT THESE PHOTOS

23:50.196 --> 23:52.832
TO ANYONE
OTHER THAN STEVE AND ETHAN?

23:52.865 --> 23:55.502
>> I DIDN'T EVEN MEAN
TO SEND THEM TO ETHAN.

23:55.535 --> 23:58.505
>> SO YOU DIDN'T INTEND
FOR THESE BOYS TO FORWARD THEM

23:58.538 --> 24:00.540
TO THE ENTIRE STUDENT BODY.

24:00.573 --> 24:03.175
>> NO, OF COURSE NOT.

24:03.209 --> 24:06.012
>> NOTHING FURTHER.

24:06.045 --> 24:08.848
>> SO YOU SENT THE PHOTO
TO STEVE AND ETHAN,

24:08.881 --> 24:11.518
AND ONE OF THEM VIRALED
THE PICTURE TO GET BACK AT YOU.

24:11.551 --> 24:13.219
>> OBJECTION,
CALLS FOR SPECULATION.

24:13.252 --> 24:14.420
>> SUSTAINED.

24:14.453 --> 24:17.023
>> DO YOU THINK ONE OF THEM ALSO
SENT YOU THE DEATH THREAT?

24:17.056 --> 24:18.558
>> YOUR HONOR.

24:18.591 --> 24:20.527
>> I'M ALLOWING IT.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.761
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

24:25.732 --> 24:26.966
>> I DON'T KNOW.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.135
>> SOMEONE DID--
PERHAPS THE SAME PERSON

24:29.168 --> 24:31.571
WHO BEAT YOU UP AND BROKE
YOUR ARM YESTERDAY.

24:31.604 --> 24:32.872
>> THIS IS IRRELEVANT.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.607
>> I BELIEVE THE RESPONDENT
WAS ATTACKED

24:34.641 --> 24:37.977
IN ORDER TO INTIMIDATE HER
AND INFLUENCE HER TESTIMONY

24:38.010 --> 24:39.546
HERE IN THIS COURTROOM TODAY.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.514
>> IS THIS TRUE, MS. GARNET?

24:44.617 --> 24:45.885
>> I HAD AN ACCIDENT.

24:45.918 --> 24:47.720
>> LET ME REMIND YOU,
YOUNG LADY,

24:47.754 --> 24:49.021
THAT YOU'RE UNDER OATH.

24:49.055 --> 24:51.858
DID SOMEONE ASSAULT YOU

24:51.891 --> 24:55.227
TO GET YOU
TO ALTER YOUR TESTIMONY?

24:58.765 --> 25:00.533
>> PLEASE
DON'T MAKE ME TELL YOU.

25:00.567 --> 25:02.902
>> I'M GIVING YOU
ONE LAST CHANCE.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.236
NAME YOUR ASSAILANT,

25:04.270 --> 25:06.238
OR I'M HOLDING YOU
IN CONTEMPT OF COURT.

25:10.643 --> 25:11.711
>> I CAN'T.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.719
>> THEN MAYBE A NIGHT
IN THE COURT LOCKUP

25:19.752 --> 25:21.053
WILL CHANGE YOUR MIND.

25:21.087 --> 25:22.855
RESPONDENT IS IN CONTEMPT.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.323
OFFICER, TAKE HER AWAY.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.926
WE'LL RESUME TOMORROW.
COURT ADJOURNED.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.194
[gavel bangs]

25:33.633 --> 25:35.568
>> WELL, AT LEAST
SHE'LL BE SAFE TONIGHT.

25:39.639 --> 25:40.640
>> [sighs]

25:40.673 --> 25:42.642
MAYBE IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

25:42.675 --> 25:44.611
SHE WON'T LISTEN TO ANYONE.

25:44.644 --> 25:47.647
>> I KNOW SOMEONE
WHO MIGHT GET THROUGH TO HER.

25:58.658 --> 25:59.659
>> WHO ARE YOU?

25:59.692 --> 26:01.661
>> KATHLEEN.

26:01.694 --> 26:03.963
I'M A FRIEND OF OLIVIA'S.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.932
I WAS SITTING IN HERE
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.

26:05.965 --> 26:08.768
>> SHE PUT YOU IN JAIL TOO?

26:08.801 --> 26:09.769
>> YEAH.

26:09.802 --> 26:12.004
AND MY DAD'S DETECTIVE STABLER.

26:13.673 --> 26:15.642
>> HOW COULD YOU DO THAT
TO YOUR PARTNER'S KID?

26:15.675 --> 26:18.144
>> I'M GLAD SHE DID.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.112
HELPED ME STOP HATING MYSELF.

26:20.146 --> 26:23.315
>> WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I HATE MYSELF?

26:23.349 --> 26:25.985
>> BECAUSE
I WAS A LOT LIKE YOU.

26:26.018 --> 26:28.154
I LET BOYS USE ME,

26:28.187 --> 26:31.691
HAVE SEX WITH ME,
EVEN HIT ME.

26:31.724 --> 26:35.394
KIM, I WAS TOO SCARED
AND TOO ASHAMED TO SAY ANYTHING.

26:35.427 --> 26:39.265
THINGS GOT SO BAD,
I WENT TO JAIL.

26:39.298 --> 26:43.035
BUT I FINALLY
LET SOMEONE HELP ME.

26:43.069 --> 26:45.371
THE SAME PERSON'S
TRYING TO HELP YOU.

26:48.975 --> 26:52.712
>> [sobbing]
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

26:52.745 --> 26:54.180
I LOVE HIM.

26:54.213 --> 26:55.915
HOW CAN I BETRAY HIM?

26:55.948 --> 26:58.017
>> HE'S BETRAYING YOU...

26:58.050 --> 26:59.852
EVERY TIME HE HITS YOU.

26:59.886 --> 27:04.056
AFTERWARDS, HE SAYS HE'S SORRY,
HE'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN.

27:04.090 --> 27:07.193
SO YOU FORGIVE HIM,

27:07.226 --> 27:09.195
BUT HE HITS YOU AGAIN.

27:09.228 --> 27:12.732
HE MAKES YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU'RE NOTHING,

27:12.765 --> 27:16.736
LIKE HE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO WILL EVER LOVE YOU.

27:16.769 --> 27:19.872
AND THEN HE HITS YOU SOME MORE

27:19.906 --> 27:23.042
AND SAYS THAT YOU DESERVE IT...

27:23.075 --> 27:24.443
DOESN'T HE?

27:24.476 --> 27:28.214
>> [crying]

27:28.247 --> 27:30.216
THE FIRST TIME...

27:30.249 --> 27:33.720
WE WERE AT A PARTY.

27:33.753 --> 27:36.889
[sobbing]
I SPILLED PUNCH ON HIM,

27:36.923 --> 27:40.893
AND HE SLAPPED ME IN THE FACE
FOR MESSING UP HIS NEW SHIRT.

27:40.927 --> 27:44.731
AND THEN IT WAS AFTER SCHOOL
FOR TALKING TO ANOTHER BOY.

27:44.764 --> 27:47.233
AND THEN IT WAS JUST
FOR NO REASON AT ALL.

27:47.266 --> 27:50.737
>> KIM, IF SOMEONE
REALLY LOVES YOU,

27:50.770 --> 27:51.971
THEY'D NEVER HURT YOU.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.941
THEY'D TREAT YOU WITH RESPECT.

27:56.442 --> 27:58.911
PLEASE...

27:58.945 --> 28:02.414
LET THEM HELP YOU.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.751
>> [sobbing]

28:04.784 --> 28:08.120
ETHAN'S ALWAYS
DOING NICE THINGS FOR ME.

28:09.956 --> 28:13.092
WE TEXT EACH OTHER
ALL THE TIME.

28:13.125 --> 28:16.262
I SENT HIM THOSE PICTURES
BY MISTAKE.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.297
>> AND HE GOT HIS HOPES UP.

28:18.330 --> 28:22.301
>> THEY WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE PRIVATE.

28:24.470 --> 28:26.272
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

28:26.305 --> 28:28.474
IF I WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN
THOSE PICTURES...

28:28.507 --> 28:31.110
>> KIM...

28:31.143 --> 28:34.246
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

28:35.815 --> 28:39.451
>> FRIDAY AT SCHOOL
I WANTED TO MAKE A CALL,

28:39.485 --> 28:42.288
BUT MY CELL PHONE
WAS MISSING FROM MY PURSE.

28:42.321 --> 28:46.125
STEVE STOLE IT, BECAUSE
HE'S ALWAYS CHECKING UP ON ME.

28:46.158 --> 28:48.795
HE FOUND THE PICTURES.

28:48.828 --> 28:51.530
HE SAW THAT
I'D SENT THEM TO ETHAN.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.967
HE THOUGHT
I WAS CHEATING ON HIM.

28:55.001 --> 28:57.804
HE SENT THE PICTURES
TO EVERYONE IN THE SCHOOL

28:57.837 --> 29:00.372
AND FAKED MY NUMBER
SO NO ONE WOULD KNOW HE DID IT.

29:00.406 --> 29:04.811
AND THEN HE SAID
IF I SAW ETHAN AGAIN...

29:04.844 --> 29:06.145
HE'D KILL ME.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.147
I TOLD HIM THAT I SENT
THE PICTURES BY ACCIDENT,

29:08.180 --> 29:09.381
BUT...

29:09.415 --> 29:12.251
HE CALLED ME A LIAR
AND HE HIT ME SOME MORE.

29:12.284 --> 29:15.855
SO I TOOK THE TRAIN
TO LITTLE NECK...

29:15.888 --> 29:16.488
TO TALK TO ETHAN,

29:16.522 --> 29:19.191
TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED.

29:21.193 --> 29:23.896
I DIDN'T KNOW
STEVE WAS FOLLOWING ME.

29:25.898 --> 29:27.499
HE JUMPED ME.

29:27.533 --> 29:29.501
I BEGGED HIM TO STOP,

29:29.535 --> 29:32.171
BUT HE WOULDN'T.

29:32.204 --> 29:35.207
THEN HE KICKED ME IN THE HEAD,
AND I PASSED OUT.

29:37.043 --> 29:39.578
>> KIMBERLY,
WERE YOU DATING ETHAN MORSE?

29:39.611 --> 29:40.712
>> NO...

29:40.746 --> 29:45.184
BUT WHEN HE GOT THE PICTURES,
HE THOUGHT I WANTED TO.

29:45.217 --> 29:47.887
I TOLD HIM
I JUST WANTED TO BE FRIENDS.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.856
>> DID STEVE WALKER
ALSO ATTACK YOU

29:49.889 --> 29:51.790
THE DAY
BEFORE WE CAME TO COURT?

29:55.561 --> 29:58.197
>> YES...

29:58.230 --> 30:00.399
SO I WOULDN'T TELL YOU
HE WAS HURTING ME.

30:00.432 --> 30:03.469
>> NOTHING FURTHER.

30:03.502 --> 30:06.906
>> YOU MAY STEP DOWN.

30:06.939 --> 30:08.340
>> YOUR HONOR...

30:08.374 --> 30:11.210
THE DEFENSE RESTS
AND MOVES FOR DISMISSAL.

30:11.243 --> 30:13.880
>> CORPORATION COUNSEL
HAS NO OBJECTIONS.

30:13.913 --> 30:17.049
>> THE DEFENSE'S MOTION
IS DENIED.

30:20.987 --> 30:23.555
>> YOUR HONOR,
THE RESPONDENT'S TESTIMONY

30:23.589 --> 30:25.557
CLEARLY SHOWED
THAT SHE HAD NO INTENT

30:25.591 --> 30:27.894
TO MAKE OR DISTRIBUTE
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.

30:27.927 --> 30:29.328
>> RESPONDENT
WILL RISE FOR MY DECISION.

30:29.361 --> 30:30.863
>> YOUR DECISION?

30:30.897 --> 30:33.232
WE HAVEN'T EVEN DELIVERED
CLOSING ARGUMENTS YET.

30:33.265 --> 30:35.567
>> I'M NOT REQUIRED TO HEAR
CLOSING ARGUMENTS.

30:35.601 --> 30:38.037
STAND UP, YOUNG LADY.

30:43.976 --> 30:45.945
KIMBERLY GARNET,

30:45.978 --> 30:49.648
I FIND YOU GUILTY OF PRODUCING,
POSSESSING, AND DISTRIBUTING

30:49.681 --> 30:53.185
A SEXUAL PERFORMANCE
BY A CHILD.

30:53.219 --> 30:56.355
I SENTENCE YOU TO INCARCERATION

30:56.388 --> 30:58.925
IN A SECURE FACILITY
FOR JUVENILE SEX OFFENDERS

30:58.958 --> 31:00.592
IN WELLSBURG, OHIO,

31:00.626 --> 31:03.262
FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR.

31:03.295 --> 31:04.931
COURT IS ADJOURNED.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.967
[gavel bangs]

31:09.535 --> 31:11.971
>> THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

31:12.004 --> 31:14.606
I LISTENED TO YOU,
AND YOU LIED TO ME.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.375
YOU SAID
THAT IF I TOLD THE TRUTH,

31:16.408 --> 31:18.277
I WOULD BE SAFE!

31:28.687 --> 31:29.621
>> THIS CAUGHT ME
COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE.

31:29.655 --> 31:32.091
>> YOU JUST GAMBLED
WITH MY CLIENT'S LIFE.

31:32.124 --> 31:34.060
>> KIM WAS A FIRST-TIME,
NONVIOLENT JUVENILE OFFENDER.

31:34.093 --> 31:35.928
THE WORST I THOUGHT
SHE'D GET WAS PROBATION.

31:35.962 --> 31:37.930
>> YEAH, WELL,
SHE'S GOING TO PRISON...

31:37.964 --> 31:39.565
500 MILES AWAY.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.234
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS
TO THAT GIRL, IT'S ON YOU.

31:42.268 --> 31:45.237
>> HOW ARE YOU GONNA FIX IT?
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN DO.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.239
>> TALK TO THE JUDGE,
HAVE HER RECONSIDER.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.241
>> I HAVE OTHER CASES
IN JUDGE MARSDEN'S COURT.

31:49.275 --> 31:50.409
IF I CHALLENGE THIS DECISION,

31:50.442 --> 31:52.111
SHE'S GONNA MAKE MY LIFE
A LIVING HELL.

31:52.144 --> 31:53.112
>> SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.

31:53.145 --> 31:53.980
I'M FILING A 440 MOTION

31:54.013 --> 31:55.581
TO VACATE THE CONVICTION
AND SENTENCING,

31:55.614 --> 31:58.017
AND I'M REPORTING YOU
TO THE BAR.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.089
>> I'M SORRY.

32:05.992 --> 32:07.193
>> [sighs]
HER HEAD ISN'T THE ONLY ONE

32:07.226 --> 32:08.427
I WANT ON A PLATTER.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.096
>> JUDGE MARSDEN'S.

32:10.129 --> 32:11.530
>> THERE'S
NO CLOSING ARGUMENTS,

32:11.563 --> 32:12.531
INSTANT SENTENCING.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.200
WHY THE RUSH TO JUDGMENT?

32:14.233 --> 32:16.268
>> THIS CITY
HAS THREE JUVENILE FACILITIES.

32:16.302 --> 32:18.137
WHY SEND HER TO OHIO?

32:18.170 --> 32:20.239
>> MAYBE SHE HAS A THING
ABOUT SEX OFFENDERS.

32:20.272 --> 32:23.475
>> THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

32:26.312 --> 32:27.980
>> EXCUSE ME.

32:28.014 --> 32:29.615
OLIVIA BENSON
FROM SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

32:29.648 --> 32:30.816
>> AH, WHAT CAN I DO
FOR THE FINEST TODAY?

32:30.849 --> 32:33.619
>> WELL, I'M WONDERING IF YOU
KEEP STATISTICS ON JUDGES.

32:33.652 --> 32:35.287
>> SURE WE DO.
WHO ARE YOU INTERESTED IN?

32:35.321 --> 32:36.455
>> HILDA MARSDEN.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.490
>> WHAT KIND OF STATS
YOU LOOKING FOR--

32:38.524 --> 32:39.325
DECISIONS, SENTENCES?

32:39.358 --> 32:40.626
>> WHATEVER YOU HAVE,
WE WANT IT.

32:40.659 --> 32:41.693
>> IT SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO LONG

32:41.727 --> 32:43.029
TO PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER
FOR YOU.

32:43.062 --> 32:46.132
>> UM, ACTUALLY, IT WILL.

32:46.165 --> 32:47.466
>> I'M SORRY.
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

32:47.499 --> 32:49.001
>> WELL, NO, THERE'S JUST
A CERTAIN PROTOCOL

32:49.035 --> 32:50.169
YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW.

32:50.202 --> 32:52.071
ALL REQUESTS
HAVE TO GO THROUGH ME.

32:52.104 --> 32:54.306
>> AND YOU ARE?
>> ED MANGINI.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.307
I'M THE SENIOR CLERK.

32:55.341 --> 32:56.542
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING,
JUST PUT IT IN WRITING,

32:56.575 --> 32:57.543
AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.111
>> AND LET ME GUESS,

32:59.145 --> 33:00.579
YOU'RE REALLY BUSY,
AND IT'LL TAKE SIX WEEKS.

33:00.612 --> 33:03.149
>> YEAH, A-AND THAT'S
IF I EXPEDITE IT.
[phone buzzing]

33:03.182 --> 33:06.652
>> AND WHY DOESN'T JUDGE MARSDEN
WANT US LOOKING AT HER STATS?

33:06.685 --> 33:08.320
>> ASK HER YOURSELF.

33:08.354 --> 33:11.757
HER HONOR
WANTS TO SEE YOU, PRONTO.

33:14.260 --> 33:17.229
>> I'LL HEAR MOTIONS
ON THIS MATTER ON TUESDAY.

33:19.198 --> 33:22.201
WE'RE IN RECESS.
LET'S TAKE 15.

33:22.234 --> 33:24.036
[gavel bangs]

33:24.070 --> 33:25.371
>> YOU WANTED TO SEE ME,
YOUR HONOR.

33:25.404 --> 33:27.506
>> YES.

33:27.539 --> 33:30.176
ARE YOU REPRESENTING
DETECTIVE BENSON, MS. POND?

33:30.209 --> 33:32.178
>> DOES SHE NEED
REPRESENTATION?

33:32.211 --> 33:33.612
>> OF COURSE NOT.

33:33.645 --> 33:36.115
WE'RE OFF THE RECORD.
JOIN THE PARTY, COUNSELOR.

33:36.148 --> 33:40.119
WHY THE SUDDEN INTEREST IN ME?

33:40.152 --> 33:41.220
>> YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ANSWER THAT.

33:41.253 --> 33:42.688
>> NOBODY'S UNDER OATH.

33:42.721 --> 33:44.423
IT'S JUST A FRIENDLY CHAT.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.358
>> THAT'S FUNNY, 'CAUSE IT
DOESN'T FEEL SO FRIENDLY.

33:46.392 --> 33:48.694
>> NO REASON
TO BE CUTE, DETECTIVE.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.196
NOW, TELL ME...

33:50.229 --> 33:53.365
WHY ARE YOU SO HOT
FOR MY SENTENCING STATS

33:53.399 --> 33:56.368
JUST HOURS AFTER I SENT
YOUR CHILD PORNOGRAPHER AWAY?

33:56.402 --> 33:57.836
>> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
YOUR HONOR,

33:57.869 --> 33:59.705
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
YOUR REASONING

33:59.738 --> 34:02.674
BEHIND SENDING KIMBERLY GARNET
TO WELLSBURG.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.710
>> OH, WELL,
IT'S THE BEST ALTERNATIVE.

34:04.743 --> 34:08.380
THERE'S NO FACILITY
WITH AVAILABLE BEDS IN NEW YORK

34:08.414 --> 34:11.083
FOR SEX OFFENDERS,
AND SHE'S A SEX OFFENDER.

34:11.117 --> 34:13.385
>> SHE'S NOT A SEX OFFENDER,
AND YOU'RE RUINING HER LIFE.

34:13.419 --> 34:17.456
>> YOU KNOW,
I AM SO TIRED OF THESE KIDS

34:17.489 --> 34:18.524
WALTZING IN HERE

34:18.557 --> 34:20.459
THINKING THEY CAN DO
WHATEVER THE HELL THEY WANT

34:20.492 --> 34:21.727
AND GET AWAY WITH IT.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.230
SOMEONE HAS TO TAKE A STAND.
>> IS THAT IT?

34:24.263 --> 34:25.731
OR DO YOU JUST GET OFF
ON THE POWER?

34:25.764 --> 34:27.233
>> OLIVIA.

34:27.266 --> 34:29.568
>> MOCK ME AGAIN, OLIVIA...

34:29.601 --> 34:31.137
AND I'LL HOLD YOU IN CONTEMPT.

34:31.170 --> 34:33.405
>> HOW? I THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST
A FRIENDLY CHAT.

34:33.439 --> 34:35.407
>> THAT'S IT!
>> YOUR HONOR,

34:35.441 --> 34:37.276
YOU DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY
TO SANCTION DETECTIVE BENSON.

34:37.309 --> 34:40.112
>> WATCH THIS.

34:40.146 --> 34:41.747
OFFICER...

34:41.780 --> 34:45.117
TAKE DETECTIVE BENSON
AND MS. POND DOWN TO THE LOCKUP.

34:45.151 --> 34:47.153
THEY'RE IN CONTEMPT.

34:53.592 --> 34:57.296
HAVE A NICE DAY, LADIES.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.604
>> OKAY.

35:05.637 --> 35:07.206
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
SPRING US.

35:07.239 --> 35:09.875
>> AFTER I'M DONE
SAVORING THE MOMENT.

35:09.908 --> 35:11.310
>> THIS IS YOUR BOSS?

35:11.343 --> 35:13.312
>> YEAH, HE'S VERY SUPPORTIVE.

35:15.347 --> 35:16.615
WE DIDN'T EVEN GET
OUR PHONE CALL.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.684
HOW'D YOU KNOW WE WERE HERE?

35:18.717 --> 35:20.386
>> SAM CALLED.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.221
>> WOW, WORD TRAVELS FAST.

35:22.254 --> 35:24.690
>> ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE ASKING
QUESTIONS ABOUT JUDGE MARSDEN.

35:24.723 --> 35:26.325
>> I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO CROSS HER.

35:26.358 --> 35:27.559
'CAUSE THIS'LL PUT YOU
IN THE LINE OF FIRE.

35:27.593 --> 35:30.462
>> AT LEAST
I'LL BE IN GOOD COMPANY.

35:30.496 --> 35:33.332
I PULLED UP HER STATS
OFF HER DATABASE.

35:33.365 --> 35:35.667
I THINK I FOUND WHAT
SHE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO SEE.

35:36.935 --> 35:39.805
>> MARSDEN SENT 19 KIDS
TO THE WELLSBURG FACILITY

35:39.838 --> 35:40.806
SO FAR THIS YEAR.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.174
>> AND 33 LAST YEAR.

35:42.208 --> 35:43.475
>> ALL TEENAGE SEX OFFENDERS?

35:43.509 --> 35:45.644
>> IT DEPENDS
ON HOW YOU DEFINE THAT TERM.

35:45.677 --> 35:48.347
URINATING IN PUBLIC, LOITERING,
PUBLIC LEWDNESS--

35:48.380 --> 35:49.481
NONE OF THESE ARE SEX OFFENSES.

35:49.515 --> 35:51.283
>> YET SHE STILL TOOK THEM
TO TRIAL

35:51.317 --> 35:52.818
AND SHIPPED THEM OFF
TO WELLSBURG.

35:52.851 --> 35:55.354
>> SHE'S TAKING MINOR OFFENSES
AND TURNING THEM INTO FELONIES.

35:55.387 --> 35:56.655
>> SO MARSDEN'S
A HANGING JUDGE.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.824
SHE'S HARSH, BUT IT'S ALL
WITHIN HER DISCRETION.

35:58.857 --> 36:01.360
>> THEN WHY DID SHE LOCK US UP
FOR ASKING ABOUT HER RECORDS?

36:01.393 --> 36:04.196
>> AND WHY DID ED MANGINI
TIP HER OFF?

36:04.230 --> 36:05.331
>> HEY!

36:05.364 --> 36:06.332
HEY, YOU!

36:06.365 --> 36:08.500
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!
GET OFF THE CAR!

36:08.534 --> 36:10.636
>> NICE WHEELS.
RENTAL?

36:10.669 --> 36:11.637
>> PLEASE, I OWN IT.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.206
>> YEAH? PRETTY PRICEY
FOR A GOVERNMENT HACK.

36:14.240 --> 36:15.674
>> I DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN
MYSELF TO YOU.

36:15.707 --> 36:16.675
>> NO...

36:16.708 --> 36:18.510
ACTUALLY, YOU DO.

36:18.544 --> 36:21.380
NOW, YOU RATTED OUT MY PARTNER
TO JUDGE MARSDEN.

36:21.413 --> 36:22.848
>> I DID NOT RAT ANYONE OUT.

36:22.881 --> 36:25.851
>> NO? THEN HOW DID I LAND
IN JAIL AFTER I TALKED TO YOU?

36:25.884 --> 36:28.687
>> [clears throat]

36:28.720 --> 36:30.522
>> I, UM...
>> HMM?

36:30.556 --> 36:32.358
>> I WOULD LIKE TO TALK
TO MY LAWYER.

36:32.391 --> 36:33.459
>> THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

36:33.492 --> 36:35.694
MAYBE HE CAN EXPLAIN
HOW YOU CAN AFFORD A MERCEDES

36:35.727 --> 36:38.697
AND A SEVEN-FIGURE CONDO
DOWN IN BOCA

36:38.730 --> 36:41.367
ON A SALARY OF, UH, 56K A YEAR?

36:41.400 --> 36:43.702
>> SEE, RIGHT NOW
YOU'RE GOING DOWN ALONE.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.871
OFFICIAL CORRUPTION,
TAX EVASION--

36:45.904 --> 36:48.240
THAT'S 20 YEARS FEDERAL TIME

36:48.274 --> 36:50.242
WITHOUT ANY
OF YOUR FLASHY TOYS.

36:50.276 --> 36:52.711
>> NOW, YOU TELL US
WHERE THE MONEY CAME FROM,

36:52.744 --> 36:54.546
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU'RE A COOPERATING WITNESS,

36:54.580 --> 36:57.316
NOT A CO-CONSPIRATOR.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.352
>> UM, OKAY, UM...

37:00.386 --> 37:05.257
JUDGE MARSDEN
LIKES A CERTAIN KIND OF CASE,

37:05.291 --> 37:06.825
AND I MAKE UP HER DOCKETS.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.727
>> SHE PAYS YOU
TO PAD HER CALENDAR

37:08.760 --> 37:10.596
WITH KIDS SHE CAN SEND
TO WELLSBURG.

37:10.629 --> 37:11.730
>> YEAH.
>> WHY?

37:11.763 --> 37:14.433
>> UM, WELL,
HER COUSIN RUNS THE PLACE,

37:14.466 --> 37:16.568
AND--AND SHE GETS A COMMISSION
FOR EVERY BED SHE FILLS.

37:16.602 --> 37:19.438
>> AND YOU SUPPLY HER
WITH THE BODIES--

37:19.471 --> 37:23.575
PETTY OFFENDERS WHO SHOULD NEVER
SEE THE INSIDE OF A JAIL.

37:23.609 --> 37:25.744
>> I AM SO SORRY.

37:25.777 --> 37:27.479
I WILL NEVER DO IT AGAIN.

37:27.513 --> 37:30.616
>> NO, ACTUALLY, YOU WILL.

37:30.649 --> 37:33.285
>> I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING
THE TIME TO SEE ME, JUDGE.

37:33.319 --> 37:36.422
>> OH, MY PLEASURE, MR. SIROTA.

37:36.455 --> 37:39.591
SO ED MANGINI TELLS ME YOU
GREW UP TOGETHER IN BROOKLYN.

37:39.625 --> 37:42.461
>> YEAH, BAY RIDGE,
89TH AND COLONIAL.

37:42.494 --> 37:44.930
POOR EDDIE, ALWAYS THE LAST KID
PICKED FOR STICKBALL.

37:44.963 --> 37:46.432
>> OH.
[laughs]

37:46.465 --> 37:48.434
>> HE NEVER TOLD ME THAT.
>> YEAH.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.469
>> ED JUST SAID
YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME.

37:50.502 --> 37:51.770
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

37:51.803 --> 37:53.772
>> [clears throat]

37:53.805 --> 37:56.308
MY 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL'S
BEEN HANGING OUT

37:56.342 --> 37:57.609
WITH THIS NEIGHBORHOOD KID,

37:57.643 --> 38:00.879
A LOWLIFE, 15,
REAL PIECE OF CRAP.

38:00.912 --> 38:01.947
EXCUSE MY FRENCH.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.615
>> I'VE HEARD WORSE
IN MY COURTROOM.

38:03.649 --> 38:05.384
>> A COUPLE DAYS AGO,
HE BOOSTS MY DEVILLE,

38:05.417 --> 38:07.018
TAKES MY GIRL FOR A SPIN,
TOTALS THE CAR.

38:07.052 --> 38:09.655
MY ANGEL COULD'VE BEEN KILLED.

38:09.688 --> 38:12.324
COPS COME.
THEY BUST HIM FOR JOYRIDING.

38:12.358 --> 38:14.460
I JUST THINK

38:14.493 --> 38:16.528
THERE SHOULD BE
SOMETHING MORE DONE.

38:16.562 --> 38:18.830
>> AND WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT ME TO DO?

38:18.864 --> 38:21.633
>> WELL, EDDIE SAYS YOU KNOW
HOW TO DEAL WITH KIDS LIKE HIM.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.335
YOU'RE NOT AFRAID TO...

38:23.369 --> 38:24.870
GIVE THEM
WHAT'S COMING TO THEM.

38:24.903 --> 38:26.805
>> I JUST SERVE
THE PUBLIC GOOD.

38:26.838 --> 38:29.475
WELL, TRUST ME, YOU WOULD BE
DOING A HUGE PUBLIC SERVICE

38:29.508 --> 38:31.343
IF YOU GOT THIS MENACE
OFF THE STREET.

38:31.377 --> 38:33.345
NOW, THE NAME
IS PAULY CATALANO,

38:33.379 --> 38:35.447
AND, UH, EDDIE SAYS THAT HE'S
IN YOUR SCHEDULE FOR TOMORROW.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.683
>> HMM.

38:42.521 --> 38:44.055
OH, SO HE IS.

38:44.089 --> 38:47.493
FIRST UP ON THE DOCKET.

38:47.526 --> 38:50.396
I'LL READ THE CASE CAREFULLY.

38:53.565 --> 38:55.667
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I APPRECIATE IT.

38:55.701 --> 38:57.669
>> YOU CAN ALWAYS SHOW
YOUR APPRECIATION

38:57.703 --> 39:01.673
WITH A DONATION
TO MY RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.575
>> OH.

39:05.811 --> 39:08.346
HAVE A NICE DAY.

39:15.587 --> 39:17.389
>> BASED ON THE FACT PATTERNS,

39:17.423 --> 39:20.526
THIS CASE HAS BEEN
WOEFULLY UNDERCHARGED.

39:20.559 --> 39:23.562
I'M AMENDING THE COMPLAINT
TO GRAND LARCENY AUTO,

39:23.595 --> 39:24.696
CUSTODIAL INTERFERENCE,

39:24.730 --> 39:26.698
AND ENDANGERING
THE WELFARE OF A CHILD.

39:26.732 --> 39:29.034
>> YOUR HONOR, THAT'S WAY
OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE CRIME.

39:29.067 --> 39:32.538
>> THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME
IN FRONT OF ME, MR. CHENG.

39:32.571 --> 39:34.506
DON'T TELL ME
HOW TO RUN MY COURTROOM.

39:34.540 --> 39:35.340
>> YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.442
WHO THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

39:36.475 --> 39:38.009
>> SHUT UP, PAULY.

39:38.043 --> 39:40.011
>> I'M GONNA TEACH YOU
A LESSON, YOUNG MAN.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.547
>> YOUR HONOR, I OBJECT.

39:41.580 --> 39:42.581
>> OBJECT ALL YOU WANT,
COUNSELOR.

39:42.614 --> 39:45.417
I'M REMANDING YOUR CLIENT
TO JAIL UNTIL TRIAL.

39:45.451 --> 39:48.587
OFFICER, TAKE THE RESPONDENT
INTO CUSTODY.

39:48.620 --> 39:49.588
WE'RE ADJOURNED.

39:49.621 --> 39:50.522
[gavel bangs]

39:50.556 --> 39:53.592
>> THE ONLY ONE
GOING INTO CUSTODY IS YOU.

39:54.926 --> 39:56.462
>> WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

39:56.495 --> 39:58.630
>> THE END OF A NIGHTMARE
FOR HUNDREDS OF KIDS.

39:58.664 --> 39:59.965
>> HILDA MARSDEN,

39:59.998 --> 40:01.533
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR BRIBERY,
OFFICIAL MISCONDUCT,

40:01.567 --> 40:02.400
AND FALSE IMPRISONMENT.

40:02.434 --> 40:04.670
>> PLUS, FEDERAL CHARGES
OF WIRE FRAUD,

40:04.703 --> 40:06.572
CONSPIRACY TO DEFRAUD
THE UNITED STATES.

40:06.605 --> 40:07.439
>> STAND UP.

40:07.473 --> 40:08.907
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.509
>> I KNOW MY RIGHTS.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.210
I'M A JUDGE.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.745
I HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG.

40:13.779 --> 40:16.582
THESE KIDS
NEED TO BE PUT AWAY.

40:16.615 --> 40:19.918
IT'S PEOPLE LIKE ME
WHO KEEP THIS COUNTRY SAFE.

40:19.951 --> 40:22.087
I HAVE THE BALLS
TO STAND UP FOR WHAT'S RIGHT,

40:22.120 --> 40:24.590
NOT LIKE
YOU LOUSY BLEEDING HEARTS.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.900
>> HOW DID I DO?

40:34.933 --> 40:36.668
>> WELL, YOU GOT A SHOT
AT BROADWAY.

40:36.702 --> 40:38.670
>> WHAT ABOUT KIM?

40:42.140 --> 40:43.542
>> ETHAN.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.113
>> HOW'D IT GO?

40:48.146 --> 40:50.482
>> CHIEF JUDGE VACATED
THE VERDICT AND THE SENTENCE.

40:50.516 --> 40:51.617
>> HER RECORD'S EXPUNGED.

40:51.650 --> 40:53.485
IT'S AS IF
NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.

40:53.519 --> 40:55.621
>> A LOT HAPPENED...

40:55.654 --> 40:57.155
BUT YOU ALL HELPED ME.

40:57.188 --> 41:00.759
>> NO, YOU HELPED YOURSELF.
