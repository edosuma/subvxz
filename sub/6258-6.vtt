00:08.400 --> 00:11.483
Pablo, I hope your weird
brujo uncle can help us out.

00:11.640 --> 00:12.880
( Chanting in Spanish )

00:13.040 --> 00:14.963
Brujo: Here's where
you find what you seek.

00:15.160 --> 00:16.366
What the hell
is this doing here?

00:16.520 --> 00:18.887
You have to bury it deep, deep

00:19.080 --> 00:20.889
below the place
where yourjourney began.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.686
30 years ago, my friends and I
spent the night at a cabin.

00:23.840 --> 00:24.887
We found a book.

00:25.080 --> 00:28.482
It awoke something in the woods,
something evil.

00:28.640 --> 00:31.530
His real hand.
Hello.

00:31.680 --> 00:34.251
This is coming along
so nicely.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.401
Weed.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.244
Just take a hit.

00:39.280 --> 00:40.281
(gun cocks)

00:40.440 --> 00:41.771
Out, demon!

00:41.920 --> 00:43.604
I command you!

00:43.760 --> 00:44.966
( Screams )

00:47.440 --> 00:49.807
Pablo: I think that Brujo's
trying to give me a sign

00:49.960 --> 00:51.883
from wherever he is.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.330
Where the hell is he?

01:15.520 --> 01:17.966
Why don't you take
a loop around?

01:18.120 --> 01:19.770
I'll check inside.

01:22.280 --> 01:25.284
( Crows cawing )

01:33.320 --> 01:36.324
( rustling )

01:37.880 --> 01:40.326
(growling )

01:40.480 --> 01:42.687
(whispering )

01:42.840 --> 01:44.205
Hola, Santa Muerte.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.768
En paz descanse.

01:47.960 --> 01:49.450
( Door shuts )

01:54.600 --> 01:56.443
(whispering )

02:07.160 --> 02:08.366
( explosion )

02:12.000 --> 02:13.923
( engine backfires )

02:14.080 --> 02:15.491
Son of a bitch.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.131
( Door creaking )

02:31.280 --> 02:33.487
I've got you now, Ashley.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.490
( Bleating )

02:42.760 --> 02:44.250
Hey, little guy.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.368
Have you seen
a one-handed asshole around here?

02:46.560 --> 02:48.005
( Bleating )

02:58.280 --> 02:59.770
Hola, perra.

03:07.680 --> 03:11.366
(growling )

03:12.560 --> 03:13.686
Ruby!

03:15.680 --> 03:18.001
You double-crosser!

03:19.400 --> 03:23.200
The others will never let you
get the book for yourself.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.685
And neither will I.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.001
Ruby!

03:29.160 --> 03:31.481
( Theme music playing )

03:43.280 --> 03:44.645
Shit!

03:49.040 --> 03:50.690
Where the fuck did it go?

03:54.320 --> 03:55.446
Fuck.

04:11.080 --> 04:16.007
♪ All my exes live in Texas ♪

04:18.279 --> 04:20.726
♪ And Texas is the place ♪

04:20.880 --> 04:25.090
♪ I'd dearly love to be... ♪

04:25.280 --> 04:27.726
Damn, jefe, you hungry?

04:27.880 --> 04:29.405
You're hurting those pancakes.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.324
I know what I have to do.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.641
Chew before you swallow.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.802
No, back at the Brujo's,

04:35.000 --> 04:38.607
when I was on
my fun little trip to Woodstock,

04:38.760 --> 04:40.364
I saw some things

04:40.520 --> 04:43.490
that made my next step
very clear.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.528
All roads to destroying this evil

04:46.720 --> 04:48.848
lead right back
to where it all began--

04:49.000 --> 04:50.570
- the cabin.
- Oh, my God.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.126
<i>30m! -</i>

04:54.280 --> 04:56.044
I guess deep down

04:56.200 --> 04:58.521
I always knew
it would lead to this.

04:58.680 --> 05:00.728
Then let's go back there
and end it all.

05:00.880 --> 05:01.927
You know I'm down.

05:02.080 --> 05:04.128
The last thing I want
every Deadite to see

05:04.320 --> 05:06.527
- is this ugly mug.
- Yeah, I know,

05:06.680 --> 05:10.765
but the thing is
you can't go with me.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.201
- I'm sorry. What?
- No. This is the end of the road.

05:14.360 --> 05:16.169
I've put your lives
in too much danger already.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.685
And this cabin,
if you go here,

05:17.840 --> 05:20.684
you would end up possessed,
and I would have to kill you both

05:20.880 --> 05:21.881
and cut your heads off,

05:22.040 --> 05:24.042
and that would just be bad
for everybody.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.008
No. I want payback.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.162
You don't get
to take that away from me.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.243
Pablo: Yeah. We knew
what we were getting into

05:31.400 --> 05:32.890
when we joined up with you.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.883
Well, no, we didn't,
not even a little bit,

05:35.040 --> 05:36.326
but we do now.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.682
And you said you wanted us
to be with you.

05:38.840 --> 05:41.844
Kelly: And if I die,
at least I went out swinging.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.401
Pablo:
Ash, if I was a Deadite,

05:44.560 --> 05:47.723
I would be honored
to have you chop my head off.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.406
Ah, thanks, Pablo.
I appreciate that.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.803
Okay. I'll think about it.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.803
Man: Ash?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.490
Lem...

05:57.640 --> 05:59.608
uh, how the hell are ya?

05:59.760 --> 06:01.171
These your grand kids?

06:01.320 --> 06:02.401
Still an asshole, I see.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.085
- Always.
- Yeah, me, too.

06:04.240 --> 06:07.562
Kelly, Pablo, this is Lem.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.603
Good to meet you.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.689
Hey, "h, you got a sec?

06:13.160 --> 06:14.400
Sure.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.524
So, you still working
the Value Stop?

06:30.680 --> 06:33.126
Maybe I could use
your, uh, employee discount

06:33.280 --> 06:35.362
for some toilet paper and ammo?

06:35.520 --> 06:37.329
No, I got off
that 0l' merry-go-round.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.960
And, Lem, I don't think
you should be waving guns around.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.566
Relax.
I'm off the sauce.

06:43.560 --> 06:45.927
Clean and sober
almost nine days.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.811
Wow, well, uh,
one foot in front of the other.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.086
- Amen.
- Yeah.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.730
Yeah, I'm really getting
my life together, you know?

06:51.880 --> 06:54.645
Even joined the militia.
Hence the ammo.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.962
Always be stockpiling--
that's our motto.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.724
That's a dumb motto.

06:58.880 --> 06:59.961
I joined after
they came up with it.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.326
- Mm.
- Anyway,

07:01.520 --> 07:02.760
you should stop by sometime.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.843
We got some really cool toys
you could play with.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.287
You know, I mightjust
take you up on that.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.408
- Yeah.
- Where's your camp?

07:09.560 --> 07:11.483
- Actually, I can't tell you that.
- Come on.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.529
Show me the hand.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.769
- Is that new?
- Long story.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.366
- There.
- Gaylord.

07:19.520 --> 07:20.726
- No.
- Really?

07:20.880 --> 07:22.803
- No.
- Gladman.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.526
I gotcha.
North of M-59?

07:28.480 --> 07:29.481
All right, what's up, dude?

07:29.640 --> 07:31.290
'Cause you're being
real weird to me today.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.807
Nope, I'm having
an amazing day.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.200
Wow.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.046
Okay.
You know what, Pablo,

07:38.200 --> 07:40.089
I know what you're going through
with your uncle,

07:40.240 --> 07:42.242
and if you need
to take it out on me,

07:42.440 --> 07:45.444
that's just fine.
I will take it if it helps.

07:46.520 --> 07:48.329
Yeah, it's not that.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.524
It's just...

07:54.160 --> 07:55.889
when you were possessed,

07:56.040 --> 07:58.611
you tried to fuck me
and then kill me.

08:00.360 --> 08:01.600
What?

08:01.760 --> 08:04.684
Like-- like,
fuck you, fuck you?

08:04.840 --> 08:06.649
Oh, yeah, you were, like,
in full-on bone mode,

08:06.800 --> 08:08.165
like a praying mantis.

08:09.160 --> 08:12.004
I mean, the killing part,
you know what, I get that.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.003
You know, you were a demon,
you were possessed.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.128
But the other part, I just...

08:16.280 --> 08:19.204
I didn't know what to make of it.
It was confusing.

08:19.360 --> 08:22.648
Shit. I'm sorry.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.201
I mean, I really--

08:25.360 --> 08:27.840
I just don't remember any of it.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.884
So, was any of that
a part of you,

08:33.039 --> 08:34.690
or was it all a demon?

08:36.280 --> 08:37.405
( Groans )

08:37.559 --> 08:38.924
You two funbags almost done?

08:39.120 --> 08:40.121
- Yeah.
- Yep.

08:40.280 --> 08:44.410
Okay, good.
Now, if-- and I mean "if"

08:44.560 --> 08:46.562
I let you come with me
back to the cabin,

08:46.720 --> 08:48.085
there's one place
I have to stop first.

08:48.240 --> 08:49.480
Pablo, when we get there,

08:49.640 --> 08:51.244
please remind me
to gas up the chainsaw.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.526
Will do.
You know I got you.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.728
- Whenever you're ready.
- Thank you, love.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.882
Five-star service.

09:00.840 --> 09:05.050
Ooh. Okay,
who's got the cash?

09:05.200 --> 09:07.521
Uh, you said it was your treat.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.843
No, no.
No, I ordered the fruit cup

09:11.000 --> 09:13.321
'cause I thought we
were taking this check to splitsville.

09:13.480 --> 09:14.686
When did I say this?

09:14.840 --> 09:16.365
Uh, when we sat down
and then again

09:16.520 --> 09:17.521
in the middle of the meal.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.286
Yeah, you said,
and I quote,

09:20.440 --> 09:23.649
"All right, you knuckleheads,
I got the grub this round."

09:23.800 --> 09:25.325
( clicks tongue )

09:26.320 --> 09:28.846
That doesn't sound familiar.
But, you know, okay.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.849
Jesus.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.606
Just go wait in the trailer, okay?
I'll pay up.

09:39.640 --> 09:40.721
( Cell phone rings )

09:40.880 --> 09:42.962
( police radio chatter)

09:43.120 --> 09:44.849
- Amanda?
- I got him.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.411
I finally fucking got him.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.045
Right now I'm looking
at the license plate

09:48.200 --> 09:50.806
for that missing trailer
from the park homicide.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.644
That's the guy, trust me.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.802
Amanda, what are you doing?
You're not on active duty.

09:54.960 --> 09:58.089
But you are. You could
bring this guy in on your collar.

09:58.280 --> 09:59.406
Run the DNA.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.927
I know we'll find a hit
on everyone from the trailer park

10:02.120 --> 10:04.282
- and the farmhouse, too.
- Where are you?

10:05.640 --> 10:08.041
The Western Moose.
He's inside.

10:08.200 --> 10:12.091
I'm on my way.
Don't do anything till I get there.

10:16.160 --> 10:19.482
( Music playing )

10:24.360 --> 10:28.081
All right. All right.
So just--

10:28.240 --> 10:31.801
will you just tell me
how exactly did I try to do

10:31.960 --> 10:33.644
all that to you?

10:36.160 --> 10:39.562
You tried to seduce me
and get me to smoke weed

10:39.720 --> 10:41.370
out of a shotgun.

10:41.520 --> 10:44.842
What? Oh, shit.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.844
- That is awesome.
- That is crazy.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.724
That is awesome.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.120
Yeah.

10:53.880 --> 10:57.009
So, what,
did you turn me down?

10:57.160 --> 11:01.324
I think so?

11:02.560 --> 11:04.881
I blacked out.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.247
Well, that sounds
like a good party.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.965
No, but, hey,
seriously,

11:12.120 --> 11:14.487
like, whatever was inside me,

11:14.640 --> 11:18.770
it just must've been preying
on howl really feel about you.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.729
How do you feel about me?

11:22.440 --> 11:26.365
I mean, you're just
so sweet and pure.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.761
How could I ever look
at you that way?

11:28.920 --> 11:31.207
And the demon
must've been twisting that

11:31.360 --> 11:33.567
and making me seem insane.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.329
Right.

11:38.480 --> 11:41.563
That makes total sense.
Of course.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.603
- Fuck that demon.
- ( chuckles )

11:43.800 --> 11:47.247
Anyway, um, I'm just--
I'm really sorry, Pablo,

11:47.400 --> 11:49.368
I put you in such
an awkward position.

11:49.560 --> 11:52.040
I promise I won't
do that to you again.

11:53.760 --> 11:56.161
- Do you hear that?
- What?

11:57.760 --> 11:59.524
- Well, anyway, uh...
-( banging )

11:59.680 --> 12:01.887
Okay, that time I heard it.

12:02.040 --> 12:03.769
( Banging )

12:06.160 --> 12:07.446
I think it's coming
from in there.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.763
That's where Ash
keeps Necronomicon.

12:10.920 --> 12:14.129
Well, it's got some serious beef
with my uncle's necklace.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.249
( Banging continues )

12:26.120 --> 12:27.281
Aah!

12:32.040 --> 12:33.883
- Push harder!
- Pushing!

12:47.040 --> 12:49.486
We need to lock that shit up
right now.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.006
( Country music playing )

12:59.280 --> 13:01.487
So, do you need anything else,
or are you good?

13:01.640 --> 13:05.531
Oh, I'm good.
The question is...

13:05.720 --> 13:08.963
Nancy,
are you good?

13:09.120 --> 13:11.600
Uh, I'm okay.
Sure.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.683
I have a friend of mine, Nancy.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.127
He strings tennis rackets
for a living.

13:16.280 --> 13:19.170
He is the best.
He can't do anything else.

13:19.360 --> 13:22.682
But where do the world's tennis pros
go to get their rackets strung?

13:22.840 --> 13:25.161
Him. Why?
'Cause he has a gift.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.203
Fascinating piece of trivia.

13:27.360 --> 13:30.887
- Nancy, I have a gift, too.
- Uh-huh.

13:31.080 --> 13:35.688
I can make sweet, sweet love
to a woman like no other man.

13:35.840 --> 13:36.841
Hmm?

13:37.040 --> 13:42.285
After I lost this hand,
this hand became

13:42.440 --> 13:44.010
"extra sensitive."

13:44.160 --> 13:45.161
( chuckles )

13:45.320 --> 13:47.209
I think you know what I mean.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.966
The reason I bring this up, Nancy,

13:50.120 --> 13:53.408
is I'm not gonna be able
to pay that check.

13:53.600 --> 13:57.400
But I think I've got something
much more valuable I can give you.

13:57.600 --> 14:02.811
Much more than $22.89.
Double that, at least.

14:02.960 --> 14:06.965
- So, Nancy...
- ( sighs )

14:07.120 --> 14:09.282
...would you like me
to string your racket?

14:10.880 --> 14:14.726
My husband,
he's right there, the cook.

14:14.880 --> 14:17.770
- See him?
- Yeah, gotcha.

14:17.960 --> 14:20.088
We gotta keep this
on the down low.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.242
Okay, tell you what--
act natural.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.084
Meet me in the men's room
in three minutes.

14:24.240 --> 14:25.241
But I gotta warn you

14:25.400 --> 14:26.970
you're gonna wanna leave
your husband for me,

14:27.120 --> 14:28.804
and I can't let that happen.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.450
Family values.

14:30.600 --> 14:34.127
Okay, toots, see you in three.

14:36.880 --> 14:40.089
Fuck the book.
I wish we could destroy it.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.845
Ash said we can't.
He tried, no dice.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.050
Actually, he said
that he tried burning it,

14:48.240 --> 14:51.847
but we could--
we could electrocute it.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.207
We could freeze it,

14:54.360 --> 14:58.206
or maybe even a pipe bomb.

14:58.360 --> 15:01.330
No, Ash said we can't
'cause we need the book

15:01.480 --> 15:03.130
to help with the Deadites.

15:03.280 --> 15:05.089
But it doesn't help.
If anything,

15:05.240 --> 15:07.527
it just keeps those things
coming back around.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.409
Wait...

15:11.440 --> 15:13.044
is that what you want?

15:13.200 --> 15:14.531
What?

15:16.040 --> 15:18.361
You told Ash
you wanted payback.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.205
You wanna keep the book around

15:21.360 --> 15:23.283
so more Deadites show up
for you to kill.

15:23.480 --> 15:25.721
No.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.644
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

15:29.800 --> 15:33.646
Kelly, you need to be careful
of revenge.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.450
My uncle, he always said,

15:35.600 --> 15:39.810
"Pablito, beware anger,
fear revenge.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.570
If once you start
down that path,

15:41.720 --> 15:44.405
forever it will dominate
your destiny.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.164
Consume you, it will."

15:46.320 --> 15:48.322
Did you just Yoda quote me?

15:48.480 --> 15:51.006
- Yeah.
- ( banging )

15:53.440 --> 15:57.729
Don't worry. I'm sure
we'll be dead way before then.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.921
( Sniffs, exhales sharply )

16:13.600 --> 16:14.806
( Clicks )

16:23.160 --> 16:24.650
Ooh. Cold.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.404
Cold. Ooh.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.526
( Clears throat )

16:30.120 --> 16:31.121
( Splash )

16:31.280 --> 16:34.045
I'd do me... all day long.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.769
There you are, baby.
Right on time.

16:39.920 --> 16:42.730
You know, they say waitresses
don't get big tips.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.041
Well, that's about to change.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.043
State police.
You're under arrest.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.531
Oh, come on! You again!

16:47.680 --> 16:51.526
Ah! Aah!
Lady, you just don't quit.

16:51.680 --> 16:52.727
Not after what you did
to my partner.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.882
Partner? I don't even know
what the hell you're talking about.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.166
The one you murdered.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.129
Murdered-- get outta town.
I'm not a killer.

16:58.280 --> 17:01.124
- Oh, yes, you are.
- No, I kill killers.

17:02.120 --> 17:04.726
Oh, easy on the strike zone there.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.244
Or not.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.807
- Oh...
- Is that lavender?

17:32.760 --> 17:34.524
I've got you, motherfucker.

17:34.680 --> 17:38.685
Like I said, you're under arrest,
for real this time.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.604
Jesus Christ.

17:45.920 --> 17:48.764
You missed your chance, darlin'.
This gal knows what it's all about.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.371
Fisher:
Shut up and keep walking.

17:53.520 --> 17:56.410
Fisher, I told you to wait.

17:56.560 --> 17:58.085
Fisher:
He was leaving, I had to move.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.971
- This guy's behind everything--
- Wow, there's an overstatement.

18:01.120 --> 18:03.930
--The farmhouse, the trailer park,
another murder out in the woods

18:04.080 --> 18:06.526
where this sicko
just burned a guy to death.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.205
Say what?

18:10.920 --> 18:12.365
Jesus, this is him.

18:12.520 --> 18:15.763
Yeah. The trailer's outside.
I bet there's evidence all over it.

18:19.480 --> 18:20.970
Okay, buddy, let's go.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.685
RoboCop is full of baloney.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.763
You know, she accosted me
in the little boys' room.

18:24.920 --> 18:27.287
Said she wanted sex
with a genuine beef stud.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.647
These are her words.
Look, you can't arrest me!

18:29.800 --> 18:32.041
I'm the only one here
who knows how to...

18:33.400 --> 18:34.640
fight

18:43.000 --> 18:44.968
( electricity crackling )

18:46.000 --> 18:47.570
- Man on TV: Donovan...
- ( static hissing )

18:48.720 --> 18:49.881
Fight what?

18:54.600 --> 18:55.601

18:55.760 --> 18:57.683
( screaming )

19:06.200 --> 19:08.123

23:32.600 --> 23:34.284
all you want is a pile of hotcakes.

23:34.440 --> 23:36.568
What do you get?
A pile of corpses,

23:36.720 --> 23:38.370
