00:00.018 --> 00:01.552
I know what you've been
doing, Franklin.

00:01.586 --> 00:03.321
I know it's not just weed
anymore.

00:03.354 --> 00:06.524
You know how I feel
about all of this.

00:06.557 --> 00:08.259
You're welcome home
when you stop.

00:08.293 --> 00:09.927
Not too long ago,
you were happy

00:09.961 --> 00:11.196
with just
a few hundred dollars.

00:11.229 --> 00:12.330
How we grow, huh?

00:12.363 --> 00:13.364
MAN: Avi!
AVI: What--

00:13.398 --> 00:14.899
MAN: LAPD!
MAN: Don't move!

00:14.932 --> 00:16.634
Hello, officer.

00:16.667 --> 00:18.403
I'll have the first load
in the next couple of days.

00:18.436 --> 00:20.605
She also tell you I'm done
paying the other tax?

00:20.638 --> 00:22.273
The tax stays.

00:22.307 --> 00:23.608
Unless you want
the streets to know

00:23.641 --> 00:25.276
it was us
that hit your family.

00:25.310 --> 00:26.444
WOMAN: Cops were clearing
an empty lot.

00:26.477 --> 00:28.113
Alton didn't want to leave.

00:28.146 --> 00:29.747
He's through the worst
of the detox,

00:29.780 --> 00:31.782
but if he gets put back
on the streets,

00:31.816 --> 00:33.284
chances are he runs right back
to the bottle.

00:33.318 --> 00:35.120
Chances are good of that
no matter where he goes.

00:35.153 --> 00:36.854
I'm done!

00:36.887 --> 00:38.789
Think that old bitch
can satisfy you the way I do?

00:38.823 --> 00:41.159
She can do ten times
what you ever could.

00:41.192 --> 00:42.560
We started this.

00:42.593 --> 00:43.928
Can't do this without you.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.663
You gonna have to try.

00:45.696 --> 00:48.299
We retaliate, the prison esÃ©s
be after all of us.

00:48.333 --> 00:50.135
Here's a deal
I'm willing to make with you.

00:50.168 --> 00:51.436
If you can figure out
who did it,

00:51.469 --> 00:53.104
then we can talk about payback.

00:53.138 --> 00:54.572
MAN: Her name is Soledad.
I brought her

00:54.605 --> 00:56.007
'cause we're gonna
get married.

00:56.041 --> 00:57.042
MAN: This is an
immigration raid!

00:57.075 --> 00:58.309
I got the paperwork.

00:58.343 --> 01:00.078
(speaking Spanish)
Puto!

01:00.111 --> 01:02.147
MAN: INS thing end up doing
what you hoped?

01:02.180 --> 01:05.616
WOMAN: The ice queen
was very impressed.

01:05.650 --> 01:07.185
She's starting to let me in.

01:24.335 --> 01:26.904
Here.

01:36.981 --> 01:37.982
No.

01:52.663 --> 01:55.166
(tense music)

01:55.200 --> 02:00.938
*

02:30.435 --> 02:33.604
*

02:40.578 --> 02:41.846
(laughter)

02:41.879 --> 02:43.248
WOMAN: Race you.

02:43.281 --> 02:46.284
(laughter)

02:50.121 --> 02:52.323
AVI: Come on.

02:52.357 --> 02:53.591
Money. Money. Money.

02:53.624 --> 02:56.261
(speaking foreign language)

02:57.295 --> 02:58.729
Want some more?

02:58.763 --> 03:00.231
What the fuck?

03:00.265 --> 03:01.766
(laughs)

03:01.799 --> 03:03.368
(children squealing)

03:03.401 --> 03:05.370
FRANKLIN: Avi.
AVI: Franklin.

03:05.403 --> 03:08.606
You see?
Money does fall from the sky.

03:08.639 --> 03:10.074
MAN: Gimme one too!

03:12.177 --> 03:14.379
AVI: Mmm, Randy's donut.

03:15.746 --> 03:19.584
You should have gotten
a full dozen, Frankie.

03:19.617 --> 03:21.652
I hear you can afford it.

03:21.686 --> 03:23.821
Got my men to look around
the neighborhood.

03:25.390 --> 03:27.057
Seems you been selling

03:27.091 --> 03:29.160
those little rocks
of yours everywhere.

03:34.165 --> 03:37.235
I'm glad to see my absence
didn't inconvenience you.

03:37.268 --> 03:38.803
Yeah, well,
my business can't stop

03:38.836 --> 03:40.638
just 'cause you got
taken off the board.

03:40.671 --> 03:43.774
AVI: I'm not mad that you found
a new supplier, Frankie.

03:46.777 --> 03:48.579
-You know why I'm not mad?
FRANKLIN: Why?

03:48.613 --> 03:49.947
Because you and me,
we're going back

03:49.980 --> 03:51.048
to business as usual.

03:51.081 --> 03:52.683
Back to selling good product

03:52.717 --> 03:54.018
at good prices.

03:54.051 --> 03:56.020
I scratch your balls.

03:57.121 --> 03:58.789
You scratch mine.

04:00.758 --> 04:01.959
You know...

04:04.362 --> 04:06.597
My old supplier,

04:06.631 --> 04:08.599
he was so sweet.

04:10.535 --> 04:13.638
Like a virgin in a whorehouse.

04:13.671 --> 04:15.606
But you know what, Frankie?

04:15.640 --> 04:17.174
I'm not going to even ask you

04:17.208 --> 04:20.110
if it is my virgin
you're fucking.

04:20.144 --> 04:21.679
I know it's not.
It can't be.

04:21.712 --> 04:23.681
Because if it is,
I-I get nervous

04:23.714 --> 04:25.483
and-and start wondering

04:25.516 --> 04:29.787
how convenient is it
that Franklin was there

04:29.820 --> 04:31.756
when the cops arrived
at my house

04:31.789 --> 04:34.892
and he was the only one
that got away.

04:40.431 --> 04:43.801
I got an appointment
with the guy who gave me up.

04:43.834 --> 04:46.637
Gonna pour gasoline down
his throat and light a match,

04:46.671 --> 04:48.706
but...

04:48.739 --> 04:50.541
next week!

04:53.010 --> 04:54.379
You and I.

04:56.681 --> 04:58.215
We're going back to business.

05:01.386 --> 05:03.388
Same deal as before.

05:13.598 --> 05:15.366
My new place and number.

05:17.001 --> 05:18.769
Nice catching up, Frankie.

05:21.939 --> 05:23.741
I'll see you soon.

05:26.777 --> 05:29.580
Yuda.
(speaks foreign language)

05:29.614 --> 05:31.282
(man speaks foreign language)

05:31.316 --> 05:34.319
(tense music)

05:34.352 --> 05:40.391
*

05:40.425 --> 05:42.259
FRANKLIN: How the hell
he get out anyway?

05:42.293 --> 05:43.928
TEDDY: My guess would be
that he cut some kind

05:43.961 --> 05:45.563
of deal with the feds.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.365
FRANKLIN: That house is full
of drugs and guns.

05:47.398 --> 05:49.434
What kind of deal Avi make
gets him back on the street

05:49.467 --> 05:51.402
doing the same shit
he went in for?

05:51.436 --> 05:53.938
He's rich, and he's white,

05:53.971 --> 05:55.105
and that's just the deal.

05:55.139 --> 05:56.841
Yeah, well, maybe I'm the deal.

05:56.874 --> 05:58.776
Maybe that motherfucker's out
so he can set me up.

05:58.809 --> 06:00.878
Maybe next time I see him,
he's wearing a wire.

06:00.911 --> 06:02.880
You think that motherfucker
gonna let me frisk him?

06:02.913 --> 06:04.248
Come on.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.750
You're being
a little bit paranoid.

06:05.783 --> 06:06.751
I'm a black man in America,
God damn it!

06:06.784 --> 06:09.019
Hell, yeah, I'm paranoid.

06:09.053 --> 06:10.388
You know,
people of your complexion

06:10.421 --> 06:11.956
don't exactly have
the best record

06:11.989 --> 06:13.824
when it comes to dealing
with people like me.

06:13.858 --> 06:16.427
And when it comes down to it,

06:16.461 --> 06:18.696
white people be afraid
of blacks,

06:18.729 --> 06:21.131
but it should be
the other way around,

06:21.165 --> 06:22.933
Mr. Kidnapper.

06:25.670 --> 06:27.772
Look.

06:27.805 --> 06:30.541
-Let me look into it.
-(scoffs)

06:30.575 --> 06:33.411
And how you gonna do that?

06:33.444 --> 06:35.179
TEDDY: Let's just say that...

06:35.212 --> 06:38.215
an LAPD paycheck
doesn't go very far.

06:38.248 --> 06:39.950
Sometimes cops need help.

06:43.488 --> 06:46.691
Even if Avi ain't trying
to set me up,

06:46.724 --> 06:48.325
he's still crazy.

06:50.294 --> 06:51.762
Might have to take him up
on his offer

06:51.796 --> 06:53.764
just so I can sleep at night.

06:55.900 --> 06:57.568
You can't go back, man.

06:57.602 --> 06:58.903
He told me he's on his way

06:58.936 --> 07:00.638
to kill the dude
he thought sold him out,

07:00.671 --> 07:03.007
and when Avi talks like that,
he's not being funny.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.510
He's being real.

07:05.543 --> 07:08.713
Just let me reach out to him.
I got a feeling I can

07:08.746 --> 07:10.347
-get him to leave you alone.
-How?

07:10.381 --> 07:11.949
There's some things
that's probably better

07:11.982 --> 07:13.484
you don't know.

07:13.518 --> 07:15.319
Right, yeah, right,
and I should

07:15.352 --> 07:16.687
wear my helmet
when I ride my bike,

07:16.721 --> 07:18.188
look both ways
when I cross the street.

07:18.222 --> 07:20.090
I gotta be there when you go,
Reed.

07:20.124 --> 07:21.426
Or I go back
to working with Avi, man.

07:21.459 --> 07:22.527
It's up to you.

07:24.929 --> 07:27.998
We show up together, he's
gonna know you betrayed him.

07:28.032 --> 07:30.935
I can't protect you then.

07:30.968 --> 07:34.572
So don't you think it's best
if he hears it from us?

07:37.041 --> 07:38.576
See you soon, Reed.

07:45.249 --> 07:48.586
MAN: (speaking Spanish)

07:54.258 --> 07:56.060
-Bye.
-Ciao.

08:00.698 --> 08:02.066
Hola.

08:02.099 --> 08:04.502
(speaking Spanish)

08:06.904 --> 08:08.939
-(speaking Spanish)
-(speaking Spanish)

08:12.943 --> 08:14.311
Actually, yes.

08:14.344 --> 08:15.746
Reed's coming to pick up
his product today

08:15.780 --> 08:17.114
so when he shows up
I'm gonna need you

08:17.147 --> 08:18.449
to help him with
these crates out to his--

08:18.483 --> 08:19.917
(door slams)

08:23.588 --> 08:26.423
-No Reed today?
-Something happened.

08:26.457 --> 08:28.225
I hope that's not a problem.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.360
Not as long you like avocados.

08:30.394 --> 08:33.598
If the quantity is right,
I like 'em plenty.

08:33.631 --> 08:34.932
LUCIA: (whistles)

08:34.965 --> 08:36.233
(speaking Spanish)

08:38.135 --> 08:40.104
MATT: Oh. No. No. No. No. No.
No. No. No.

08:40.137 --> 08:42.206
I got it.

08:42.239 --> 08:44.041
Allow me.

08:44.074 --> 08:46.577
Right in the back, guys.
Thank you.

08:46.611 --> 08:48.412
So you're the one who flies
the loads in, right?

08:48.445 --> 08:52.550
Uh, I've been known to fly
a little from time to time.

08:52.583 --> 08:54.619
You know, Soledad's
never been in a plane.

08:54.652 --> 08:56.353
MATT: Are you curious?

08:56.386 --> 08:58.789
You wanna give it a try?

08:58.823 --> 09:00.925
Here's your chance.

09:00.958 --> 09:02.259
Matt can be your first time.

09:04.161 --> 09:06.096
I don't know.

09:06.130 --> 09:08.132
First times are not always fun.

09:08.165 --> 09:10.134
Well, I have never had
a girl complain

09:10.167 --> 09:12.603
to me about being her first.

09:12.637 --> 09:15.239
-(laughs)
-She's great company.

09:15.272 --> 09:17.675
You should take her with you
on one of your Colombia trips.

09:17.708 --> 09:19.243
Help pass the time.

09:19.276 --> 09:22.312
SOLEDAD: I'm game if you are.

09:22.346 --> 09:23.581
Maybe we should start
with something

09:23.614 --> 09:25.583
a little closer to home.

09:25.616 --> 09:26.984
What do you say?

09:27.017 --> 09:28.586
Okay.

09:28.619 --> 09:29.820
I'll let you know.

09:29.854 --> 09:31.756
Looking forward to it.

09:33.223 --> 09:34.291
Ladies.

09:38.295 --> 09:41.832
-(speaks Spanish)
-(speaks Spanish)

09:48.706 --> 09:50.240
I did not appreciate that.

09:50.274 --> 09:52.142
(speaking Spanish)
I'm just playing him.

09:52.176 --> 09:54.779
By using me to lead him on.

09:54.812 --> 09:56.280
Mm-mm.
He's gonna give up

09:56.313 --> 09:57.782
his supplier
before he tries to fuck you.

09:57.815 --> 10:00.785
-(scoffs)
-Just keep working him.

10:00.818 --> 10:02.920
You did great, by the way.

10:29.179 --> 10:30.581
The hell are you looking for?

10:32.750 --> 10:34.484
Oh. Uh...

10:34.518 --> 10:36.120
I was gonna make a egg salad,

10:36.153 --> 10:38.022
but you out of mustard.

10:41.592 --> 10:45.029
You thought I was looking
for booze, didn't you?

10:45.062 --> 10:46.631
No.

10:46.664 --> 10:50.601
I threw all that out
the night you moved in.

10:50.635 --> 10:52.169
Anyway, I don't have time
for lunch.

10:52.202 --> 10:55.039
ALTON: (stammering)
Wait.

10:55.072 --> 10:56.907
Now, uh...

10:56.941 --> 10:59.944
Listen, I know it can't be easy
with me being here.

11:01.779 --> 11:03.748
Extra mouth to feed and all.

11:03.781 --> 11:06.316
Well, how are you doing
with the bills?

11:06.350 --> 11:08.552
Mortgage.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.521
There's a...

11:11.555 --> 11:12.723
I want to be able to

11:12.757 --> 11:16.761
try and help out
if you need it.

11:16.794 --> 11:19.029
The only thing I need
is to finish getting dressed

11:19.063 --> 11:20.564
so I'm not late.

11:36.647 --> 11:37.948
PEACHES: Renny?

11:37.982 --> 11:39.650
(woman moaning)

11:41.585 --> 11:44.054
(moaning continues)

11:44.088 --> 11:46.056
LEON: Know what you want, huh?

11:46.090 --> 11:47.624
(woman moaning)

11:47.658 --> 11:50.227
LEON: Uh-huh, that shit
feel good, don't it?

11:50.260 --> 11:51.929
WANDA: Ow!
LEON: Stop. We going in.

11:51.962 --> 11:54.865
Fuck.
You like that shit, woman?

11:54.899 --> 11:55.933
PEACHES: What's raw
is the stank

11:55.966 --> 11:57.768
coming off your black ass.

11:57.802 --> 11:59.203
WANDA: You told me no one
was fucking here.

12:01.171 --> 12:02.940
Nigga, I was fucking.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.374
You call that fucking?

12:04.408 --> 12:06.110
Look like you was
playing leap frog.

12:06.143 --> 12:07.778
Where Kevin at?

12:07.812 --> 12:09.814
-The fuck I know.
-He's your boy.

12:09.847 --> 12:12.382
He my boy, not my boyfriend,
you fruitcake motherfucker.

12:12.416 --> 12:14.985

12:26.430 --> 12:29.166
WOMAN: Yeah, she did.
Yeah, she did.

12:29.199 --> 12:30.467
She's just jealous.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.602
FRANKLIN: Can I help you?

12:32.636 --> 12:34.338
-Like help with what?

12:34.371 --> 12:36.673

13:01.265 --> 13:03.000

13:04.568 --> 13:05.870
I'm always careful

13:05.903 --> 13:07.838

13:10.074 --> 13:12.076

13:17.714 --> 13:19.183
JEROME: Hey, somebody

PEACHES: Hey, it's Peaches.

FRANKLIN: Hold tight.

Hey, Unc!

13:52.716 --> 13:54.751
ALTON: Hey, can we talk?

13:54.785 --> 13:56.420
I'm sorry, what?

13:56.453 --> 13:58.188
No. We ain't got nothing
to talk about.

13:58.222 --> 13:59.523
What you doing here?

13:59.556 --> 14:01.125
I'm busy right now.
Please leave.

14:01.158 --> 14:03.894
ALTON: It's your mother.

14:03.928 --> 14:05.429
What about her?

14:05.462 --> 14:07.664
ALTON: Well, it's the house.

14:07.697 --> 14:09.199
She's three months behind.
I think she's gonna lose--

14:09.233 --> 14:11.235
What the fuck you know
about the house?

14:11.268 --> 14:13.070
Well, I had a little accident,

14:13.103 --> 14:15.072
and she took me in.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.207
-Took you in? What?
DELORES: Fuck you, Jerome.

14:17.241 --> 14:18.742
You said we was going
to Fatburger.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.945
No, I said,
"I was gonna go to Fatburger."

14:20.978 --> 14:22.512
You was gonna take
your ass home.

14:22.546 --> 14:25.182
Oh, so it's like that?

14:25.215 --> 14:26.783
What y'all stupid-ass niggas
looking at?

14:29.519 --> 14:31.555
Don't even think
about calling me.

14:33.423 --> 14:34.658
'Scuse me.

14:38.095 --> 14:39.930
Jerome.

14:39.964 --> 14:42.900
New friend of yours?

14:42.933 --> 14:44.568
JEROME: You know how it is.

14:48.939 --> 14:50.474
Everything all right?

14:50.507 --> 14:52.276
You high, man?

14:52.309 --> 14:54.478
If I was high,
you'd know it, man.

14:56.013 --> 14:57.681
Go help Peaches.

15:02.152 --> 15:03.820
What up, man?

15:03.854 --> 15:07.157
(ethereal music)

15:07.191 --> 15:09.193
Hold up,
somebody say you can come in?

15:12.129 --> 15:13.630
Hey, hold on now.

15:15.299 --> 15:17.167
I didn't come here
to talk about me.

15:18.869 --> 15:20.637
I saw the notices this morning.

15:22.039 --> 15:24.508
But if you wanted
to help your mama out.

15:24.541 --> 15:26.276
(laughs)

15:26.310 --> 15:28.278
-You have the means.
-Oh, I see. Yeah.

15:28.312 --> 15:30.514
There it is.
So I give you the money

15:30.547 --> 15:31.848
and you just gonna go give
it to my moms, huh?

15:31.882 --> 15:33.617
No. No. It ain't like that.

15:33.650 --> 15:35.119
Been like that since
I was old enough to know

15:35.152 --> 15:36.553
what the word "deadbeat" meant.

15:36.586 --> 15:38.655
Now, listen.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.290
I said my piece.

15:40.324 --> 15:42.626
Now, you do what you want.

15:42.659 --> 15:44.694
I will.

15:46.463 --> 15:47.664
Nice shoes.

15:49.733 --> 15:51.501
Tell me what you think
of this one.

15:51.535 --> 15:54.771
It's got a longer runway,
better coverage on approach

15:54.804 --> 15:56.840
and still easily accessible
by Jeep.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.478
Hmm.

16:03.547 --> 16:07.217
I think I could get it in here.

16:07.251 --> 16:10.387
What's with the hesitation?

16:10.420 --> 16:12.256
Is there anti-aircraft
in the canopy?

16:15.759 --> 16:17.627
Look, it's not like
I'm not having fun here.

16:17.661 --> 16:19.396
I am.

16:19.429 --> 16:21.898
But this was supposed
to be temporary.

16:21.932 --> 16:23.400
You remember?

16:23.433 --> 16:25.235
So now in addition
to coke from Colombia

16:25.269 --> 16:28.072
you want to start delivering
guns to Honduras

16:28.105 --> 16:29.839
and add that to the mix?

16:29.873 --> 16:31.708
-Hey, Matt?
-Yeah?

16:31.741 --> 16:33.110
If you're thinking
about leaving

16:33.143 --> 16:35.946
this would be a very bad time.

16:35.980 --> 16:38.082
Well, is there gonna be
a good time?

16:38.115 --> 16:41.885
Well, yeah,
when we've won the war.

16:41.918 --> 16:45.822
-I have a life to get back to.
-Come on.

16:45.855 --> 16:47.024
What?

16:47.057 --> 16:48.959
-I mean, I saw your life.
-What?

16:48.993 --> 16:53.197
It's cutting up jackpots
with local barflies.

16:53.230 --> 16:55.899
Wow.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.434
You're a fucking asshole.

16:57.467 --> 16:58.935
TEDDY: Okay.

16:58.969 --> 17:01.571
I'm sorry.
I'm an asshole.

17:01.605 --> 17:03.073
But, look.

17:03.107 --> 17:05.942
You're not just a pilot.

17:05.976 --> 17:08.045
You--I trust you.
You're good at this.

17:08.078 --> 17:09.713
You're good at all this,

17:09.746 --> 17:12.282
and you're better at talking
to people than I am.

17:12.316 --> 17:13.683
I need you.

17:13.717 --> 17:15.285
MATT: Oh.

17:15.319 --> 17:17.621
Then why don't you stop
insulting me

17:17.654 --> 17:20.724
and start asking me questions
about how I can make this work.

17:20.757 --> 17:22.926
Okay, yes, you're right.
I'm sorry.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.795
What is it that you need?
Please, tell me.

17:25.829 --> 17:27.197
I need more money.

17:27.231 --> 17:28.865
And not just for Dad.

17:28.898 --> 17:33.403
But to start up my own thing
when this all ends.

17:33.437 --> 17:35.572
-Your own thing?
-Yeah.

17:35.605 --> 17:38.608
I want to start
a skydiving school.

17:38.642 --> 17:40.177
Are you kidding?

17:40.210 --> 17:41.578
Why would I be kidding?

17:41.611 --> 17:43.913
I get paid

17:43.947 --> 17:46.683
to fly airplanes
and jump out of them.

17:46.716 --> 17:50.387
I can't think of anything
better than that.

17:50.420 --> 17:52.756
Okay, yeah. No, yeah.
I mean, whatever you need,

17:52.789 --> 17:54.624
you got it.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.460
Is that it?

17:58.495 --> 18:00.397
And no more dead bodies.

18:00.430 --> 18:03.633
Moving them.
Disposing of them. Nothing.

18:03.667 --> 18:06.570
You want me to fly?
That's what I agree to.

18:06.603 --> 18:08.072
Yeah?

18:10.274 --> 18:12.176
Yeah, of course.

18:12.209 --> 18:14.144
And the plane.

18:14.178 --> 18:16.012
When this is done,
I'm taking the plane home.

18:16.046 --> 18:17.147
You can buy another one.

18:17.181 --> 18:18.782
Okay. Now you're pushing it.

18:18.815 --> 18:20.750
All right, you have fun.

18:20.784 --> 18:22.652
Okay, fine.
You can take the plane.

18:22.686 --> 18:24.621
Is that it?

18:24.654 --> 18:25.989
Boy, it sounds like
you need me, huh.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.357
Oh, God. Here we go.

18:27.391 --> 18:30.494
We should just say
I'm essential.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.062
Yeah, let's say that.
(electronic beeping)

18:32.096 --> 18:35.132
MATT: The best big brother
a guy could have.

18:35.165 --> 18:37.301
A crackerjack pilot.

18:37.334 --> 18:40.137
A world-renowned cocksman.

18:40.170 --> 18:41.738
Okay, we're done here.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.480
Is it true Alton's back
at the house?

18:54.050 --> 18:56.520
-We'll talk later.
-We could talk right now.

18:56.553 --> 18:58.588
It's none of your business
who I let into my house.

18:58.622 --> 19:00.524
-Excuse me.
-It's my business when he

19:00.557 --> 19:01.958
comes at me
asking for handouts.

19:01.991 --> 19:03.893
You know he tried to say
it was for you?

19:03.927 --> 19:05.495
Some bullshit about you
losing the house?

19:05.529 --> 19:07.497
MAN: Miss. Miss.

19:07.531 --> 19:08.932
Just a second.

19:08.965 --> 19:11.701
(pager beeps)

19:11.735 --> 19:13.670
You know he's only there
to take advantage of you.

19:13.703 --> 19:16.072
You know that, right?

19:16.106 --> 19:18.708
MAN: Miss! Miss.
-Mama.

19:18.742 --> 19:20.177
MAN: Come get it!

19:20.210 --> 19:21.811
Sissy, order's up.

19:21.845 --> 19:24.013
Miss, I want more coffee.

19:25.615 --> 19:26.950
Here's your fucking coffee.

19:31.488 --> 19:33.523
Sissy, is everything okay?

19:34.624 --> 19:36.893
Everything's fine.

19:38.061 --> 19:40.063
(indistinct chatter)

19:42.199 --> 19:44.434
He can't be staying there.

19:44.468 --> 19:47.103
You'll have no say
about my life.

19:50.006 --> 19:51.575
FRANKLIN: He hasn't changed.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.643
I don't give a fuck
about how clean he look.

19:55.779 --> 19:56.880
Just remember.

19:56.913 --> 19:58.182
I used to lay in bed all night

19:58.215 --> 19:59.316
listening to you cry over him.

20:00.684 --> 20:02.018
Now he's the only reason

20:02.051 --> 20:04.120
I'm not crying in my bed
every night.

20:04.154 --> 20:06.756
(bell rings)

20:06.790 --> 20:10.227
MAN: Sissy, you got
another order.

20:10.260 --> 20:11.761
MAN: Thank you, ma'am.

20:21.638 --> 20:23.440
(speaking Spanish)

20:23.473 --> 20:27.577
GUSTAVO: Franklin was late.

20:27.611 --> 20:31.348
I'm surprised the lady
witch doctor didn't warn you.

20:31.381 --> 20:33.082
You know I'm just teasing you,
right?

20:33.116 --> 20:37.020
You don't believe
in anything higher, do you?

20:37.053 --> 20:38.154
Okay, fine.

20:38.188 --> 20:40.156
How did it go really?

20:40.190 --> 20:42.025
Is our future looking bright?

20:44.961 --> 20:47.163
She warned me.

20:47.197 --> 20:48.498
(whistles)

20:51.668 --> 20:54.003
You see how it curves?

20:54.037 --> 20:58.242
It means don't trust
short Mexican women.

20:58.275 --> 21:01.811
Especially the ones
whose names rhyme with sandia.

21:01.845 --> 21:03.347
(speaking Spanish)

21:06.216 --> 21:08.017
Pedro, Soledad.

21:12.389 --> 21:14.658
We have two hours to get
everything ready for pickup.

21:17.327 --> 21:20.297
(dramatic music)

21:20.330 --> 21:26.336
*

21:30.907 --> 21:33.710
Okay, you see this?

21:33.743 --> 21:35.712
These numbers do not match.

21:35.745 --> 21:38.382
I think we missing
a case of Hennessy.

21:38.415 --> 21:40.650
-A whole damn box.
-Yeah.

21:40.684 --> 21:42.686
Somebody about to
get their ass beat.

21:42.719 --> 21:44.220
FRANKLIN: Sure hope
y'all ain't talking about me.

21:44.254 --> 21:45.822
CLAUDIA: Hey.
LOUIE: (laughs)

21:45.855 --> 21:47.223
-What's happening, handsome?
-How you doing?

21:47.257 --> 21:48.625
-Hey.
-Good.

21:48.658 --> 21:50.894
Make a phone call
about this Henny.

21:50.927 --> 21:52.629
Don't leave without
saying good-bye.

21:52.662 --> 21:55.732
FRANKLIN: Mm! Oh, we missed you
for Christmas.

21:55.765 --> 21:57.667
You missed me
or you missed my cooking?

21:57.701 --> 21:59.068
-Both.
-(laughs)

21:59.102 --> 22:00.837
-Wanda Bell stepped up.
-Okay.

22:00.870 --> 22:02.706
Girl think if she can
cook crack, she can cook ham.

22:02.739 --> 22:04.941
Well, I ain't sorry
I missed that.

22:04.974 --> 22:06.242
How was your holiday?

22:06.276 --> 22:07.577
It was the shit.

22:07.611 --> 22:08.812
Claudia took me to New York.

22:08.845 --> 22:10.547
-New York, for real?
-Yes.

22:10.580 --> 22:11.881
Shopping on Fifth Avenue,

22:11.915 --> 22:14.217
the tree at Rockefeller Center.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.219
And freezing yo' ass off.

22:16.252 --> 22:18.355
We managed to keep warm.

22:18.388 --> 22:20.590
-(laughs)
-It was amazing.

22:20.624 --> 22:23.727
We went out every night.
The Danceteria in Manhattan.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.128
Man, we trying bring
some of that

22:25.161 --> 22:27.230
New York flavor up in here.

22:29.032 --> 22:30.900
You okay?

22:30.934 --> 22:33.537
Shit ain't been the same
since you left.

22:33.570 --> 22:35.605
Avi's out of jail
showing up at the house.

22:35.639 --> 22:37.240
Alton moved back in
with my moms.

22:37.273 --> 22:39.042
-Jerome's a mess.
-Franklin.

22:39.075 --> 22:40.109
There ain't no calm voice
in the mix.

22:40.143 --> 22:41.945
You know, no center.

22:41.978 --> 22:43.413
But if you was there,
it'd be perfect.

22:43.447 --> 22:45.415
Franklin.

22:45.449 --> 22:47.317
If you want to come here
and catch up, baby,

22:47.351 --> 22:48.918
I am always happy to see you.

22:48.952 --> 22:51.254
But don't do this.

22:51.287 --> 22:52.922
You're really happy?

22:52.956 --> 22:55.559
LOUIE: As I've ever been.

22:56.893 --> 22:59.228
The world is opening up.

23:01.498 --> 23:03.800
Then I'm happy for you.

23:03.833 --> 23:06.470
LOUIE: Mm, thank you.

23:08.838 --> 23:12.141
I love you, Franklin.

23:12.175 --> 23:13.943
Love you too.

23:13.977 --> 23:16.012
Then we'll see you soon, okay?

23:16.045 --> 23:17.647
Mm-hmm.

23:17.681 --> 23:21.017
-Maybe. Maybe you'll see me.
-Maybe? We better.

23:21.050 --> 23:23.387
(laughs)

23:23.420 --> 23:24.954
(door knocking)

23:32.028 --> 23:34.731
Q-vo, Oso?
Where's the party at?

23:34.764 --> 23:36.700
GUSTAVO: Close the door.

23:46.309 --> 23:47.677
'Sup, Pedro?

23:47.711 --> 23:49.613
Fuck you been up to?

24:01.290 --> 24:03.026
Been meaning to ask.

24:03.059 --> 24:05.695
How's the familia?

24:05.729 --> 24:07.731
Fuck you know about my family?

24:07.764 --> 24:10.366
-Or what?
-I'm not talking to you.

24:14.438 --> 24:17.006
This is Las Monarcas familia
right here.

24:18.508 --> 24:20.577
Las Monarcas
control everything.

24:21.711 --> 24:24.481
It's just you,

24:24.514 --> 24:26.349
these two, and the puta.

24:34.023 --> 24:36.526
No mas,
what Gabriella lets you.

24:42.932 --> 24:45.835
(suspenseful music)

24:45.869 --> 24:47.637
*

24:47.671 --> 24:50.239
I'm gonna carve my placa
in your neck.

24:50.273 --> 24:52.408
And you're gonna let me.

24:59.382 --> 25:00.617
(gunshot)

25:02.385 --> 25:03.587
-(shotgun blasts)
-Ah!

25:03.620 --> 25:04.921
(gunshots)

25:08.257 --> 25:09.793
(gunshot)

25:11.194 --> 25:12.428
(gunshot)

25:17.133 --> 25:18.735
(groans)

25:20.737 --> 25:24.007
(groans)

25:24.040 --> 25:25.675
Lucia.

25:27.410 --> 25:29.045
-Fuck.
-Pedro.

25:29.078 --> 25:30.446
Flatten some boxes.

25:30.480 --> 25:33.149
Put them on the floor
in the office.

25:33.182 --> 25:36.185
(speaking Spanish)

25:36.219 --> 25:37.420
(groans)

25:53.503 --> 25:55.238
(door creaks)

26:12.956 --> 26:15.024
Wasn't my plan to see him.

26:16.359 --> 26:18.662
So what?
It just happened?

26:18.695 --> 26:20.296
ALTON: It did.

26:21.765 --> 26:23.199
And it definitely wasn't

26:23.232 --> 26:25.034
my plan for him
to track you down.

26:25.068 --> 26:27.971
But he did.
At my job.

26:28.004 --> 26:30.406
You didn't think he'd have
a reaction seeing you?

26:30.439 --> 26:31.541
Learning that
you're staying here?

26:31.575 --> 26:33.442
Yeah, well, I said I'm sorry.

26:35.945 --> 26:38.314
Excuse me, I ain't done
speaking my mind.

26:40.650 --> 26:43.620
He caused a scene, Alton.

26:43.653 --> 26:45.188
I could have gotten fired.

26:45.221 --> 26:47.390
I was wrong.
I admit it.

26:49.125 --> 26:52.028
But I've seen the notices.

26:52.061 --> 26:54.097
You're an inch away
from losing this place.

26:56.432 --> 26:57.834
Now,

26:57.867 --> 27:00.169
I've already been to the VA,

27:00.203 --> 27:02.505
and it's gonna take a while

27:02.538 --> 27:04.708
for me to reclaim my benefits.

27:06.342 --> 27:08.011
ALTON: What I was thinking--
-Franklin ain't no savior.

27:08.044 --> 27:09.545
Well, your brother--

27:09.579 --> 27:11.514
I'm not gonna take
no drug money handout.

27:11.547 --> 27:13.316
You're willing
to lose this house?

27:13.349 --> 27:15.852
Yes, I would fucking lose
this house!

27:26.830 --> 27:29.532
Well...

27:29.565 --> 27:31.935
I'm sorry.
I thought I was helping.

27:34.203 --> 27:37.040
Hey, you've done--
you done right by me.

27:38.642 --> 27:41.745
Nurse me back to life, and...

27:41.778 --> 27:44.247
I'm gonna send you what I can

27:44.280 --> 27:47.283
when the benefits
start to come in.

27:47.316 --> 27:49.719
But I refuse to be
more of a burden to you

27:49.753 --> 27:52.421
than I've been already, so...

27:52.455 --> 27:54.557
tomorrow, I'm gonna move out.

28:01.230 --> 28:03.733
But thank you

28:03.767 --> 28:05.401
for everything.

28:09.639 --> 28:11.641
You are quite a woman.

28:13.777 --> 28:16.112
And it's not like
I didn't know that before.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.589
CISSY: Alton, wait.

28:42.939 --> 28:45.608
You're such a goddamn man.

28:47.010 --> 28:49.278
Hunt and gather
and all that bullshit.

28:49.312 --> 28:50.780
Really, you are.

28:59.789 --> 29:03.760
You have never been less
of a burden to me

29:03.793 --> 29:05.394
in your entire life.

29:13.302 --> 29:16.472
Why don't you go get the...

29:16.505 --> 29:19.943
ground beef out
of the freezer to thaw.

29:19.976 --> 29:21.911
I'll finish changing and...

29:23.980 --> 29:25.749
We'll make dinner.

29:31.520 --> 29:34.490
(upbeat percussive music)

29:34.523 --> 29:38.294
*

29:38.327 --> 29:41.898
(upbeat jazz music)

29:41.931 --> 29:48.938
*

30:12.028 --> 30:13.362
(door knocks)

30:20.303 --> 30:22.005
Get him the fuck out
of my sight.

30:22.038 --> 30:23.206
Can we talk about this?

30:23.239 --> 30:25.008
AVI: I treated you like a son.

30:25.041 --> 30:27.176
I opened my home,
my heart to you

30:27.210 --> 30:28.744
and this is how
you pay me back?

30:28.778 --> 30:31.714
-No.
-I approached him.

30:31.747 --> 30:32.982
I had to convince him

30:33.016 --> 30:34.550
that it was in
his best interest

30:34.583 --> 30:35.584
to do business with me.

30:37.053 --> 30:38.554
Then he's all yours.

30:40.089 --> 30:41.424
Good luck with those pebbles.

30:42.926 --> 30:44.527
I'm sure our paths will cross.

30:44.560 --> 30:46.195
What's that supposed to mean?

30:46.229 --> 30:47.864
Whatever you want it to mean.

30:47.897 --> 30:48.898
You're a big man now.

31:12.721 --> 31:15.224
Don't fucking touch my rib eye.

31:27.470 --> 31:29.839
What the fuck do you know
about guns?

31:31.674 --> 31:33.910
Well, I know that you
cut a deal with the ATF.

31:33.943 --> 31:35.879
That's why you're walking free
right now.

31:35.912 --> 31:37.580
Oh, really?

31:37.613 --> 31:39.315
What's the deal?

31:39.348 --> 31:41.750
You gave someone up.

31:41.784 --> 31:43.452
Right?

31:43.486 --> 31:46.422
And judging by this
very nice hotel suite

31:46.455 --> 31:47.756
and all the extra security
you got,

31:47.790 --> 31:50.860
I'm guessing
it was someone big.

31:50.894 --> 31:53.462
I mean, I'm surprised
you're still in Los Angeles

31:53.496 --> 31:55.031
if I'm honest.

32:04.373 --> 32:07.343
Why are we even
talking about this?

32:07.376 --> 32:09.478
I am very much like you, Avi.

32:09.512 --> 32:11.847
I am a man...

32:11.881 --> 32:13.983
of eclectic interests.

32:14.017 --> 32:15.518
So I'm thinking
if you got

32:15.551 --> 32:17.186
a little wriggle room
in this deal

32:17.220 --> 32:18.988
that you cut maybe we could
help each other out.

32:19.022 --> 32:21.457
Only place I don't have
wriggle room is in my shorts.

32:21.490 --> 32:23.659
What do you need?

32:28.564 --> 32:30.799
Handguns, assault rifles,
submachines.

32:30.833 --> 32:33.869
All you can get.
In bulk.

32:33.903 --> 32:36.805
I can get an awful lot.

32:36.839 --> 32:40.009
Well, then I'm gonna
make you a very rich man.

32:40.043 --> 32:42.278
You're getting my dick hard,
Reed.

32:42.311 --> 32:44.513
(sighs)

32:44.547 --> 32:47.016
Here's the thing.

32:47.050 --> 32:48.651
I don't care where you get 'em.

32:48.684 --> 32:50.553
I only care that they are not
U.S.-made

32:50.586 --> 32:52.488
and that you can deliver them
somewhere outside the country

32:52.521 --> 32:54.257
where I can pick them up
and fly them out.

32:56.525 --> 32:58.661
You have a place in mind?

32:58.694 --> 33:00.729
Yeah, I hear that Panama
is nice this time of year.

33:00.763 --> 33:04.433
Panama is pretty nice
all year round, actually.

33:04.467 --> 33:06.669
-Really?
-Yeah.

33:06.702 --> 33:07.703
Good to know.

33:09.172 --> 33:11.274
You understand that if we
do this, it's by the book.

33:12.775 --> 33:15.244
I need you to be dependable.
None of this cowboy bullshit.

33:15.278 --> 33:17.013
When have you known me
not to be dependable?

33:17.046 --> 33:18.047
TEDDY: (laughs)

33:20.616 --> 33:21.951
(sighs)

33:28.524 --> 33:29.858
I set this up,

33:29.892 --> 33:33.029
you better have the money
to back it.

33:33.062 --> 33:34.497
'Cause the people I use...

33:36.565 --> 33:40.236
They don't get their money,
it's your name I'm giving them.

33:42.371 --> 33:44.707
-(speaks foreign language)
-(laughs)

33:44.740 --> 33:49.178
(speaking foreign language)

33:52.248 --> 33:55.618
Those, from Panama, those guns.

33:55.651 --> 33:58.821
They make their way
someplace interesting?

34:05.761 --> 34:08.897
-Let's go.
-No.

34:08.931 --> 34:12.635
Not till Avi tells me we good.

34:12.668 --> 34:15.804
You broke my heart, kid.

34:15.838 --> 34:20.076
But when a bird grows hair
on its balls...

34:20.109 --> 34:22.711
he's gotta leave the nest!

34:22.745 --> 34:24.847
(laughing)

34:24.880 --> 34:28.751
(eerie music)

34:28.784 --> 34:30.786
(imitates plane noises)

34:32.621 --> 34:35.291
Just like that, huh?
So we good?

34:37.493 --> 34:39.162
What can I say?

34:40.663 --> 34:42.831
My generosity knows
no boundaries.

34:44.467 --> 34:48.104
*

34:48.137 --> 34:49.772
LUCIA: (screaming)

(groans)

34:54.577 --> 34:56.112
(speaks Spanish)

34:59.948 --> 35:02.351
I just said
I'll take care of it!

35:04.720 --> 35:06.289
(speaking Spanish)

35:06.322 --> 35:07.523
(groans)

35:07.556 --> 35:09.658
(panting)

35:14.830 --> 35:18.101
I haven't shot a gun in years.

35:18.134 --> 35:20.002
I learned from my father.

35:20.035 --> 35:24.006
We used to hunt the javelinas
that'd come into our backyard.

35:24.039 --> 35:26.342
We didn't even kill
for sport or food.

35:26.375 --> 35:27.910
He just hated them.

35:27.943 --> 35:31.147
*

35:31.180 --> 35:32.881
You saved my life.

35:35.851 --> 35:37.486
*

35:37.520 --> 35:39.422
We are family now.

35:42.425 --> 35:44.260
That is what we do.

35:54.570 --> 35:57.173
(panting)

35:57.206 --> 35:58.541
I don't know about this.

36:03.246 --> 36:06.215
Nobody comes here.

36:06.249 --> 36:07.450
Andale.

36:15.291 --> 36:17.660
How the fuck you squash it?

36:17.693 --> 36:19.395
It was Reed.

36:19.428 --> 36:22.231
Pulled Avi aside and spoke
to him alone in a room.

36:22.265 --> 36:23.599
I don't know what he said,

36:23.632 --> 36:25.568
but that Reed got connections.

36:25.601 --> 36:28.704
Pretty sure he got at least
one cop on the payroll.

36:28.737 --> 36:30.773
Are you surprised
that the LAPD is corrupt?

36:30.806 --> 36:32.541
Hell, nah.

36:32.575 --> 36:34.777
Just never expect to see
that shit except the movies.

36:34.810 --> 36:37.246
What's up, Kev?

36:37.280 --> 36:38.781
Hey, what the fuck happened
to y'all?

36:38.814 --> 36:40.249
Some shit
with the Mexican girls.

36:40.283 --> 36:41.884
Yeah, we can see that.

36:41.917 --> 36:44.220
Is you being careful
with the ladies?

36:44.253 --> 36:45.788
Wait, I'm sorry.
Did you ask me

36:45.821 --> 36:47.356
to come let you know
how it went?

36:47.390 --> 36:48.591
This is how it went.

36:48.624 --> 36:49.725
What?

36:51.627 --> 36:54.197
You don't think I can find
those Mexican motherfuckers?

36:54.230 --> 36:55.564
Think I'm too stupid?

36:55.598 --> 36:57.700
Not as good as
the great holy Saint.

36:57.733 --> 37:00.636
Yeah, think the whole
fucking thing's too stupid.

37:01.837 --> 37:03.706
I mean,
look at y'all motherfuckers.

37:03.739 --> 37:05.941
Man, this is a fucking joke.
Do you think this is a game?

37:05.974 --> 37:07.743
No, I don't think it's
a fucking game, Saint.

37:07.776 --> 37:10.112
You don't? Then why you
acting like a fucking idiot?

37:10.145 --> 37:12.080
This shit ends tonight.

37:12.114 --> 37:16.084
No more barrio manhunts.
It's done.

37:16.118 --> 37:17.820
Saint.

37:17.853 --> 37:19.388
-Saint!
-It's done.

37:19.422 --> 37:21.324
-Saint, ain't nobody--
FRANKLIN: It's done.

37:24.527 --> 37:26.962
(door thuds)

37:26.995 --> 37:29.565
Stupid motherfuckers, man.

37:29.598 --> 37:31.500
SOLEDAD: Salud.

37:35.103 --> 37:36.639
Better than any painkiller.

37:46.249 --> 37:49.252
And when Stomper
doesn't show up...

37:49.285 --> 37:51.153
They will come.

37:54.390 --> 37:55.958
We need to clean that room
by morning.

37:55.991 --> 37:57.693
-Oh, really?
-Soledad, help Pedro.

37:57.726 --> 37:58.927
I need to talk to Oso
for a second.

37:58.961 --> 38:01.497
Mm-hmm.

38:06.835 --> 38:08.537
E Soledad...
(groans)

38:10.773 --> 38:12.541
Gracias.

38:16.345 --> 38:18.314
(sighs)

38:26.355 --> 38:28.223
(speaking Spanish)
No more shipments.

38:28.257 --> 38:30.793
No more crack.
She's a fucking cop.

38:30.826 --> 38:32.861
Or DEA.
But definitely the law.

38:35.798 --> 38:37.400
The way she held that gun.
The way she stood.

38:37.433 --> 38:39.101
She didn't miss a fucking shot.

38:39.134 --> 38:40.235
That's muscle memory.

38:40.269 --> 38:41.570
(speaks in Spanish)

38:41.604 --> 38:43.406
Then how are we not in jail?

38:43.439 --> 38:45.908
Because she's building
a case, Oso.

38:45.941 --> 38:48.777
Getting us, she wants more
than she already has.

38:48.811 --> 38:51.280
Our distributors.
La Fuerza.

38:51.314 --> 38:53.115
All of us.
Either way, we're fucked.

38:56.018 --> 38:58.521
(dramatic music)

38:58.554 --> 38:59.888
Okay.

39:04.793 --> 39:06.562
If she's a cop...

39:09.131 --> 39:10.966
What does that make Pedro?

39:19.608 --> 39:23.579
(solemn music)

39:23.612 --> 39:29.618
*

40:15.664 --> 40:20.636
(tense music)

40:20.669 --> 40:27.275
*
