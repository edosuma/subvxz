WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:05.072
So, which was it--

00:05.072 --> 00:07.574
staff meeting or
tailgate party?

00:07.574 --> 00:08.475
Staff meeting.

00:08.475 --> 00:09.543
To discuss
what's happening

00:09.543 --> 00:10.811
with the sanitation
workers.

00:10.811 --> 00:12.779
Looks we're going
to have a garbage strike.

00:12.779 --> 00:14.882
And I may be leading it.

00:14.882 --> 00:16.183
Hey, you knew
when you became an intern

00:16.183 --> 00:18.452
that it also meant
being a glorified maid.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.254
Well, fortunately, there's light

00:20.254 --> 00:22.155
at the end of the
mustard-splattered tunnel.

00:22.155 --> 00:25.459
I just wrote an article that
could land me my own column.

00:25.459 --> 00:26.293
Ooh, I love it.

00:26.293 --> 00:29.530
Today a crumb-sweeper,
tomorrow a...

00:29.530 --> 00:31.331
crumb-sweeper
with a column.

00:31.598 --> 00:32.866
So, what's the story about?

00:32.866 --> 00:35.335
How credit card companies
prey on college students.

00:35.335 --> 00:37.804
First, they get
solicitors on campus

00:37.804 --> 00:40.641
that seduce the kids
with all kinds of free gifts.

00:40.641 --> 00:43.577
Yeah, you mean like phone cards,
T-shirts, candy?

00:43.577 --> 00:45.012
Yeah, how did you know?

00:45.012 --> 00:46.046
Go on.

00:46.113 --> 00:48.415
Well, then they rush them
into signing an application

00:48.415 --> 00:50.350
before they even read
the fine print.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.386
Stupid fine print.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.888
I mean, that-that sounds like
a great idea for a story.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.590
Thanks. But it wasn't
totally my idea.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.058
Actually, Roxie suggested it.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.693
I'm going to take her to dinner.

00:59.693 --> 01:01.295
When I can look at food again.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.463
It's funny how you
two ended up being
best friends.

01:03.463 --> 01:04.731
Didn't she hate
you at first?

01:04.731 --> 01:06.266
Oh, Roxie hates everybody
at first.

01:06.266 --> 01:08.402
It's her way
of reaching out to people.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.336
Uh, bub, bub, bub, bub...

01:09.336 --> 01:12.306
That is a perfectly good
half cruller.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.575
Hey, Mike, did you
get a chance to
read my article yet?

01:14.575 --> 01:17.010
Oh, yeah, I put aside
the sanitation issue

01:17.010 --> 01:18.812
and the welfare
of the entire city

01:18.812 --> 01:21.648
so I could really focus
on what my intern wrote.

01:21.648 --> 01:23.850
Next time
less powdered, more glazed.

01:24.518 --> 01:27.120
See, now, me-- I prefer the
powdered over the glazed.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.121
Who cares?

01:28.121 --> 01:29.723
If Mike would just
read my article,

01:29.723 --> 01:31.391
then he would stop thinking
of me as the doughnut girl

01:31.391 --> 01:34.294
and look at me
with a newfound respect.

01:34.294 --> 01:35.262
And with even more respect

01:35.262 --> 01:36.597
when I get rid
of this jelly stain.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.098
( <i>chuckles</i> )

01:40.267 --> 01:42.603

gathering hard news?

02:27.514 --> 02:29.616
Psh...I wish.

02:29.616 --> 02:31.885
First, I had to pick up
donut crumbs.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.954
Then I had to scrape
my ego off the floor.

02:33.954 --> 02:36.623
Mike chastised me for
bugging him about my article.

02:36.623 --> 02:38.525
Maybe this will take
your mind off your problems.

02:38.525 --> 02:40.394
ROXIE:
Hi, and welcome to <i>Chick Chat.</i>

02:40.394 --> 02:42.329
Today a very special chick

02:42.329 --> 02:43.430
is going
to be chatting with me--

02:43.430 --> 02:45.198
my roommate Morgan Cavanaugh.

02:45.198 --> 02:46.633
Has she gone mad?

02:46.633 --> 02:48.802
Why would Roxie
have Morgan on the show?

02:48.802 --> 02:51.938
I'm filing it under "bizarre,
inexplicable phenomena."

02:51.938 --> 02:53.607
Morgan is my complete opposite

02:53.607 --> 02:55.709
morally, spiritually,
and intellectually.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.377
Because we disagree
on everything,

02:57.377 --> 02:59.246
I thought it would make
for compelling radio.

02:59.246 --> 03:00.814
I disagree.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.250
Okay, here's
our first topic.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.419
How should students
design their curriculum?

03:05.419 --> 03:07.721
Ideally,
with a curriculum designer.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.122
But they don't exist.

03:09.122 --> 03:11.224
Giorgio Armani, hello?

03:11.224 --> 03:12.626
( <i>tapping desk</i> ):
Untapped market.

03:12.626 --> 03:13.894
I believe we students

03:13.894 --> 03:15.195
should take classes
we're passionate about,

03:15.195 --> 03:17.531
not just those that will get
us closer to our degrees.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.965
Well,that's fine
if you want to be

03:18.965 --> 03:22.002
the oldest living
sociology major on welfare.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.004
I, however, am going
after the classes

03:24.004 --> 03:26.073
that will get me
a seven-figure income

03:26.073 --> 03:27.941
and homes
on three continents.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.711
You are the shallowest
person I've ever met.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.879
She had to have her on the radio
to discover that?

03:32.879 --> 03:35.649
MORGAN:
You are a hostile
pseudo-intellectual

03:35.649 --> 03:38.051
whose hair is begging
for a hot oil treatment.

03:38.051 --> 03:41.288
And your hair is begging for
a brain to keep under it.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.223
This is a train wreck
waiting to happen.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.491
Here's the best part.

03:44.491 --> 03:46.526
Pretty soon they'll
be bringing it all back here.

03:46.526 --> 03:48.595
Which is why I'm going
to get something to eat.

03:48.595 --> 03:49.496
You want to come?

03:49.796 --> 03:50.864
And miss the possibility

03:50.864 --> 03:52.799
of women wrestling
in my own home?

03:52.799 --> 03:53.900
I'm out of here.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.870
And while you're drooling,
try to protect the counter.

03:58.271 --> 04:00.941
Zellie, have you seen
our finances lately?

04:00.941 --> 04:03.110
We've lost a ton
in the stock market.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.377
Oh, everybody has.

04:04.377 --> 04:05.245
But we're lucky.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.147
We get to invest
in the Other Realm market.

04:07.147 --> 04:09.049
I'm sure we've made
plenty of money there.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.450
Let's check.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.853
We're taking a bath.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.821
Salem, what are you doing
in here?

04:14.821 --> 04:16.923
I just like
splashing around in the bubbles.

04:16.923 --> 04:17.791
( <i>laughing</i> )

04:17.791 --> 04:19.693
Oops! Dropped the soap.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.029
Zellie, we're in hot water.

04:23.029 --> 04:25.932
We need an investment
that's safe, smart, and liquid.

04:25.932 --> 04:26.967
I've got it.

04:26.967 --> 04:27.968
Real estate.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.903
I've always wanted
a vacation home.

04:29.903 --> 04:32.005
Maybe a little beach house
on Cape Cod?

04:32.005 --> 04:33.807
Forget it, sisso,
we're getting a mountain cabin.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.976
I don't do sand crabs
or Kennedys.

04:36.643 --> 04:39.646
Okay, I had a horrible day
and a really bad patty melt.

04:39.646 --> 04:41.481
I don't want to hear any
fighting out of you two.

04:41.481 --> 04:42.182
Who's fighting?

04:42.182 --> 04:44.251
We're giving each other
pedicures.

04:44.251 --> 04:46.119
How do I look in "Lilac Fudge"?

04:46.119 --> 04:48.054
Very stylish,
but I still prefer you

04:48.054 --> 04:49.823
in "Cherries Jubilee."

04:49.823 --> 04:50.624
I don't get it.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.424
On the radio you guys

04:51.424 --> 04:52.993
were ready
to strangle each other.

04:52.993 --> 04:53.927
That's before
we racked up

04:53.927 --> 04:55.662
the highest ratings
in the station's history.

04:55.662 --> 04:56.663
Yes.

04:56.663 --> 04:57.998
That's great.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.766
Oh, you'll never believe
what happened to me today.

04:59.766 --> 05:02.002
Hold on, Sabrina, did I tell
you that the station manager

05:02.002 --> 05:03.503
called <i>Chick Chat</i>
his flagship show?

05:03.503 --> 05:04.871
He says that he wants to put it
on the Internet

05:04.871 --> 05:06.373
so that anybody
that missed it live

05:06.373 --> 05:07.374
can catch it later.

05:07.374 --> 05:08.508
( <i>laughing</i> )

05:08.508 --> 05:09.609
I'll say it one last time.

05:09.609 --> 05:10.644
A wrestling component

05:10.644 --> 05:12.612
could bring in a
whole other audience.

05:12.612 --> 05:15.215
So, anyway,
I asked Mike to read my article

05:15.215 --> 05:16.483
and he just about ripped
my head off.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.451
Oh, careful, Roxie,
you're getting nail polish

05:18.451 --> 05:19.653
on my cuticle.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.353
ROXIE:
Sorry.

05:20.353 --> 05:22.489
Hey, do you know anything
that softens calluses?

05:22.489 --> 05:24.124
Yeah, me.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.725
As soon as you are
done with my toes,

05:25.725 --> 05:28.261
I will teach you the
fine art of pumicing.

05:28.261 --> 05:28.895
You know, my feet

05:28.895 --> 05:31.298
could use a
little work...

05:31.298 --> 05:34.768
at some point...
by a licensed professional.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.002
speaking of professional,

05:36.002 --> 05:37.537
I may have to switch professions

05:37.537 --> 05:40.040
since Mike chewed me out
about my article.

05:40.040 --> 05:40.974
Which article?

05:40.974 --> 05:43.009
Oh, you know, the one
you gave me the idea for.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.811
The one about credit cards?

05:44.811 --> 05:46.379
Yeah, yeah.

05:46.379 --> 05:48.748
Big companies
ripping off students.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.785
Hey, I got a great idea
for our next show.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.186
MORGAN:
Outstanding.
What is it?

05:53.186 --> 05:55.021
Let's talk about God.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.357
Oh, God is fabulous!

05:57.357 --> 06:00.961
Without him, we wouldn't have
seasons and Joey Fatone.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.028
( <i>giggling</i> )

06:02.028 --> 06:03.797
It's true.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.939
ZELDA:
<i>We looked at five houses,</i>
<i>and none of them</i>

06:12.939 --> 06:14.841
were good enough
for Lady Cheapskate.

06:14.841 --> 06:16.243
The were all overpriced.

06:16.243 --> 06:18.411
Oh, please, the last seller
we talked to

06:18.411 --> 06:19.946
came down 50%.

06:19.946 --> 06:22.148
That is,
until Hilda made her cry.

06:22.148 --> 06:23.717
It's called negotiating.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.486
It's called strong-arming
an 85-year-old widow.

06:26.486 --> 06:29.222
Excuse me, a <i>spry</i>
85-year-old widow.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.857
Hilda, I don't want to
fight about this anymore.

06:30.857 --> 06:32.792
Why don't you just pick
out a house that you want

06:32.792 --> 06:34.127
and tell me
where to sign?

06:34.127 --> 06:35.595
That is
the first rational thing

06:35.595 --> 06:38.064
that you've said all day. Tea?

06:38.064 --> 06:39.399
Please.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.635
<i>(sigh) Finally, some peace and</i>
<i>quiet.</i>

06:41.635 --> 06:43.470
My life is a complete disaster.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.538
So much for quiet.

06:45.538 --> 06:46.673
I poured my heart
into an article

06:46.673 --> 06:47.874
my boss won't
even read,

06:47.874 --> 06:49.976
and now Roxie, who I thought
was my best friend,

06:49.976 --> 06:52.479
is all buddy-buddy with Morgan
and clipping her toenails.

06:52.479 --> 06:53.580
I've got a better one.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.682
My sister, who is supposed
to be <i>my</i> best friend,

06:55.682 --> 06:57.450
spent the entire day
dismissing me

06:57.450 --> 06:58.551
while we were house-hunting.

06:58.551 --> 07:00.120
I thought we had settled this.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.555
Obviously I still have issues.

07:02.555 --> 07:03.290
I'll say.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.225
Issue number one:
you stink with money.

07:05.225 --> 07:08.128
ZELDA:
<i>I</i> stink with money?
Your middle name is Sucker.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.229
I can't help that.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.897
I'm named after
Grandma Sucker.

07:10.897 --> 07:13.466
Well, I'm going
to go jump off a speeding bus.

07:13.466 --> 07:15.802
Thanks for your warm words
of consolation.

07:15.802 --> 07:17.170
Our pleasure.
Bye, honey.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.905
Actually, if
you remember,

07:18.905 --> 07:21.641
Grandma's full name
was Sucker-Buffoon.
(door opens)

07:21.641 --> 07:22.208
(door closes)

07:22.642 --> 07:23.643
Ooh, perfect timing.

07:23.643 --> 07:24.811
Oh, let me guess.

07:24.811 --> 07:26.479
The cappuccino maker
exploded, and they need me

07:26.479 --> 07:28.348
to wipe the crud
off the ceiling.

07:28.348 --> 07:30.050
Yeah, but there's
something else.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.185
There's a lull in the garbage
talks, and Mike's here.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.219
Maybe now's a better time

07:33.219 --> 07:34.587
to talk to him
about your article.

07:34.587 --> 07:35.689
No way.

07:35.689 --> 07:38.191
The last thing Mike wants to do
right now is talk to me.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.759
Hey, Spellman,
can I talk to you?

07:39.759 --> 07:42.095
I want to do an article
on Adams College.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.097
That's great. I'm so glad
that you've read my...

07:44.097 --> 07:46.433
Have you heard these girls
on <i>Chick Chat?</i>

07:46.433 --> 07:48.535
Well, yeah, I guess
somewhere along the way

07:48.535 --> 07:49.436
I've caught the show.

07:49.436 --> 07:52.138
Are they as phenomenal
as everyone says?

07:52.138 --> 07:54.341
I suppose, you know,
if "phenomenal" is your thing.

07:54.341 --> 07:55.408
Yeah, it is.

07:55.408 --> 07:58.178
Bruce, I need 1,500 words
on those <i>Chick Chat</i> chicks.

07:58.178 --> 07:58.945
Hey, Mike, I know them.

07:58.945 --> 08:00.080
You want me to
take some photos?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.848
MIKE:
That's what I pay you for.

08:01.848 --> 08:04.150
Oh, this just gets
better and better.

08:04.451 --> 08:06.886
SALEM:
<i>The Other Realm People Finder?</i>

08:06.886 --> 08:08.455
Yeah, I'm trying to get
in touch with my past.

08:08.455 --> 08:10.056
Maybe it'll help me
forget my present.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.858
I can relate.

08:11.858 --> 08:13.426
No, I can't.

08:13.426 --> 08:14.928
What's wrong with your present?

08:14.928 --> 08:16.196
Well, let's see.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.331
My writing career is
over before it started.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.066
My best friend has
a new best friend,

08:20.066 --> 08:21.267
and they have
a hit radio show

08:21.267 --> 08:23.236
that was a flop
when I was on it.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.205
Basically I'm a failure
in all mediums.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.040
It's "me-dyah."

08:27.040 --> 08:28.742
And now my cat is
correcting my grammar.

08:28.742 --> 08:31.011
I think that's known
as rock-bottom.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.481
Who's Cathy Winters?

08:34.481 --> 08:36.649
Somebody who was
always there for me.

08:36.649 --> 08:38.685
She was my best friend
till we were 16.

08:38.685 --> 08:41.421
In fact, we both found out we
were witches at the same time.

08:41.421 --> 08:43.723
Then she moved to
the Other Realm.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.292
Hey, Cathy,
it's me, Sabrina!

08:46.292 --> 08:48.828
Oh, my gosh-- Sabrina Ballerina!

08:48.828 --> 08:50.430
Chatty Cathy.

08:50.430 --> 08:51.531
This is so weird.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.799
I was just thinking about you

08:52.799 --> 08:54.501
and Beth Connelly's
slumber party.

08:54.501 --> 08:55.935
That time you put my
bra in the freezer?

08:55.935 --> 08:58.304
Talk about colder than
a witch's... never mind.

08:58.304 --> 09:00.740
So what's up, Sabrina?

09:00.740 --> 09:02.909
I just missed you
and wanted to see
how you were doing.

09:02.909 --> 09:03.610
I'm great.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.945
I'm working as a travel agent
in the Other Realm.

09:05.945 --> 09:08.648
Hey, why don't you pop over
for a visit?

09:08.648 --> 09:11.451
Unless you've got more important
things going on in your life.

09:11.451 --> 09:12.986
I'll be right there.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.357
Sabrina, it is so
great to see you.

09:17.357 --> 09:18.925
You, too.

09:20.460 --> 09:21.995
Wow, what a place.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.297
You must be doing
really well, huh?

09:24.297 --> 09:25.298
I'm very lucky.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.800
I have a very
loyal clientele.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.268
After their first
trip with me,

09:28.268 --> 09:30.003
they always seem to
come back for more.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.105
So, what's your specialty--
time travel?

09:32.105 --> 09:33.440
Outer galaxy tours?

09:33.440 --> 09:34.974
River rafting on Jupiter?

09:34.974 --> 09:36.943
Actually, my specialty
is relaxation getaways

09:36.943 --> 09:39.479
for people that are really
stressed out by everyday life.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.781
Boy, did I come
to the right place.

09:41.781 --> 09:44.651
Hey, Cathy, I had the worst day
at the office today.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.786
My new boss
is a complete gargoyle.

09:46.786 --> 09:47.620
Literally.

09:47.620 --> 09:50.023
Any chance you can book me
a getaway right now?

09:50.023 --> 09:51.291
Absolutely.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.259
Seth, say hello to
my old friend Sabrina.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.594
Nice to meet you.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.930
That bad day stuff
must be contagious.

09:56.930 --> 09:57.664
I had one, too.

09:57.664 --> 09:59.165
Then you should come up
with me to Cloud Ten.

09:59.165 --> 10:00.600
It's such a trip.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.802
Cloud Ten? I thought
they only went up to nine.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.304
This is a new state-
of-the-art cloud.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.805
30% fluffier
than Nine

10:05.805 --> 10:08.508
and a silver lining
that'll knock your socks off.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.643
Oh, I don't know about this.

10:10.643 --> 10:12.412
Come on,
what do you have to lose--

10:12.412 --> 10:13.546
except your problems?

10:13.546 --> 10:15.682
Hmm... what the heck?

10:15.682 --> 10:17.517
I am on vacation.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.422
<i>(lounge music plays)</i>
<i>Here we are.</i>

10:22.422 --> 10:25.925
Wow, this is incredible.

10:25.925 --> 10:28.194
Everyone seems so...

10:28.194 --> 10:29.562
...mellow.

10:29.562 --> 10:33.199
The longer you're up here,
the mellower you get.

10:34.901 --> 10:37.036
Hey, Cathy.

10:37.036 --> 10:39.339
Thanks for another
great trip.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.741
Oh, uh, Bob back there--
he likes it so much,

10:41.741 --> 10:43.776
he wants to
extend his stay.

10:43.776 --> 10:45.111
I'll get him squared away.

10:45.111 --> 10:47.547
Andy, this is Sabrina.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.782
She's a first-timer.

10:49.782 --> 10:50.950
( <i>knowing chuckle</i> )

10:50.950 --> 10:54.254
So what kind of worries
brought you here?

10:54.254 --> 10:56.489
Oh, you know,
thankless job,

10:56.489 --> 10:58.024
friends who don't seem
to care,

10:58.024 --> 10:59.626
life going
right down the toilet.

10:59.626 --> 11:02.562
Hmm. Well, close your eyes,

11:02.562 --> 11:04.364
take a deep breath,

11:04.364 --> 11:07.700
and I guarantee all your
problems will disappear.

11:07.700 --> 11:13.139
( <i>inhaling deeply</i> )

11:14.440 --> 11:18.711
Wow. It's like my problems
never even existed.

11:18.711 --> 11:19.345
( <i>chuckles</i> )

11:19.345 --> 11:20.880
I can't believe I've been
walking around like a wreck

11:20.880 --> 11:22.515
in the Mortal Realm
when instead...

11:22.515 --> 11:25.518
You could have
been on Cloud Ten.

11:35.962 --> 11:38.498
<i>(funk music</i> <i>plays)</i>
Wow,this isincredible.

11:38.498 --> 11:39.666
I feel like I'm floating
on air.

11:39.666 --> 11:41.634
And not just because
I'm on a cloud.

11:42.569 --> 11:43.970
What's so great
about this place

11:43.970 --> 11:46.406
is it frees your mind

11:46.406 --> 11:49.542
to think about the really
important things in life.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.777
For instance...

11:50.777 --> 11:55.014
I've got four freckles
on the back of my hand.

11:55.014 --> 11:55.882
Why?

11:55.882 --> 11:57.750
Wow, that is deep.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.052
And why is it called
peanut butter

11:59.052 --> 12:00.853
if there's
no butter in it?

12:00.853 --> 12:03.289
I don't know.

12:03.289 --> 12:05.792
And why are they
called peanuts?

12:05.792 --> 12:07.260
I don't know.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.229
We should think about
this for a couple hours.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.496
Okay.

12:12.098 --> 12:13.533
What were we thinking
about again?

12:14.167 --> 12:15.068
So, Sabrina,

12:15.068 --> 12:16.236
are you enjoying
yourself?

12:16.236 --> 12:18.504
I am... what I yam.

12:18.504 --> 12:20.506
And that's all I yam.

12:20.506 --> 12:22.942
Hey, you know what would
taste so good right now?

12:22.942 --> 12:25.278
A big old yam.

12:25.278 --> 12:25.812
( <i>gasps</i> )

12:25.812 --> 12:26.946
Thanks.

12:26.946 --> 12:28.514
I love this place.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.450
I think she's hooked
on Cloud Ten.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.618
It's hard not to be.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.386
You look at all those
poor idiots down there

12:33.386 --> 12:35.154
who are still worrying
about their jobs,

12:35.154 --> 12:36.289
their
relationships,

12:36.289 --> 12:39.058
and their needlessly
complicated lives.

12:39.058 --> 12:39.993
Like that guy.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.095
He's worried about getting
an "A" on his midterm.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.529
Then he'll get an "A"
on his midterm

12:43.529 --> 12:45.632
and worry about getting
an "A" on his final.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.200
Only it's not final

12:47.200 --> 12:48.668
because it doesn't end there.

12:48.668 --> 12:51.237
Yeah, then he'll worry
about getting his degree,

12:51.237 --> 12:53.673
getting a job,
getting married, getting old.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.375
Oh, reality's a drag.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.410
Even thinking about it
is a drag.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.745
Then why are we?

12:58.745 --> 13:00.546
Let's dance.

13:00.780 --> 13:09.422
Whoo-hoo! ( <i>funk music continues</i>
<i>to play with added percussion</i> )

13:09.422 --> 13:12.191
Zellie, the search is over.

13:12.191 --> 13:13.960
I found us the
perfect house.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.395
I hope no octogenarians

13:15.395 --> 13:17.030
were harmed in the process.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.032
She'll bounce back.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.167
Anyway, the house is gorgeous
and roomy.

13:21.167 --> 13:23.436
Salem even gets his view
of the Kennedys.

13:23.436 --> 13:26.806
If you call Ted
in a Speedo a view.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.375
What did you do,
try on my lipstick?

13:29.375 --> 13:31.544
Yeah, and I ate
a tube of mascara.

13:31.544 --> 13:32.712
Sue me!

13:32.712 --> 13:34.380
Ow!

13:34.380 --> 13:37.550
Anyway, Zelda, the house
is a great English Tudor.

13:37.550 --> 13:38.885
It has five bedrooms,

13:38.885 --> 13:41.621
four baths, and hardwood floors
in every room.

13:41.621 --> 13:42.955
Sounds perfect.

13:42.955 --> 13:44.791
Plus, it's close to the airport.

13:44.791 --> 13:45.992
<i>Close</i> to the airport?

13:45.992 --> 13:47.093
It's on the runway!

13:47.093 --> 13:48.728
Salem!
Hilda.

13:48.728 --> 13:50.730
Okay, I'll keep looking.

13:51.798 --> 13:52.532
Great news.

13:52.532 --> 13:53.933
There's been some
major progress

13:53.933 --> 13:55.401
in the garbage negotiations.

13:55.401 --> 13:56.736
Both sides have finally agreed

13:56.736 --> 13:58.271
on where to have
the next meeting.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.472
Ooh.

13:59.472 --> 14:00.840
Hey, speaking of garbage,

14:00.840 --> 14:02.575
Sabrina wrote
this piece that...

14:02.575 --> 14:04.410
I mean, this really
great piece...

14:04.410 --> 14:05.144
Save your breath.

14:05.144 --> 14:06.946
I read it. It is great.

14:06.946 --> 14:08.281
And as soon as she makes
some changes,

14:08.281 --> 14:09.649
it's going right in the paper.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.351
That's fantastic.
Can I call and tell her?

14:11.351 --> 14:12.852
No, no, it's a big secret.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.053
Get her on the horn!

14:14.053 --> 14:16.155
I need those changes done.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.727
Well, to tone biceps,
I always do dumbbell curls.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.829
Now, for triceps,
nothing beats

14:22.829 --> 14:25.832
two or three sets
of seated push-ups.

14:25.832 --> 14:27.233
MAN ( <i>on phone</i> ):
What exactly does
that have to do

14:27.233 --> 14:29.001
with the unemployment rate?

14:29.001 --> 14:30.303
I think I can explain.

14:30.303 --> 14:33.639
Morgan, the caller wanted to
talk about the lack of work,

14:33.639 --> 14:35.341
not the lack
of working out.

14:35.341 --> 14:36.509
I know that.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.745
I just thought listeners
would be more interested

14:38.745 --> 14:40.780
in how I firm my upper body.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.882
Okay, let's go
to the next caller.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.684
You're on with <i>Chick Chat.</i>

14:44.684 --> 14:45.685
Roxie, it's Josh.

14:45.685 --> 14:46.552
Do you know where Sabrina is?

14:46.552 --> 14:48.054
She's not answering
her cell phone.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.288
You're calling
a radio station

14:49.288 --> 14:50.890
to find out where
your girlfriend is?

14:50.890 --> 14:52.191
What's wrong with that?

14:52.191 --> 14:54.727
I make my boyfriend check in
every half hour.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.063
That is so dominating
and controlling.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.731
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.133
Because it is.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.668
Hello?
Still looking for Sabrina.

15:03.169 --> 15:13.179
<i>(funk music with a guitar riff</i>
<i>plays)</i>

15:13.179 --> 15:17.016
Whoa! careful. Man, you are
wild.

15:17.016 --> 15:19.685
Yeah, well, this place
really lets me let loose.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.455
You know, I'm glad
you enjoyed the trip,

15:22.455 --> 15:24.090
but it's time for you
to go back.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.091
What do you mean?

15:25.091 --> 15:25.958
I don't want
it to be over.

15:25.958 --> 15:27.293
Can't I stay just
a little longer?

15:27.293 --> 15:29.295
You can stay
as long as you want.

15:29.295 --> 15:30.363
Whoo-hoo!

15:30.363 --> 15:33.199
But this time I'm going
to have to charge you.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.333
Oh.

15:34.333 --> 15:35.535
Uh, fine, I understand.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.804
I mean, after all,
this is your business.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.839
Hey, anybody know how to do
the Tush Push?

15:39.839 --> 15:40.973
I do!

15:40.973 --> 15:43.142
Come on, everybody.

15:43.142 --> 15:44.343
All right.

15:44.343 --> 15:46.579
Shift your weight forward,
bump your right hip twice.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.815
Shift your weight back,
bump your left hip twice.

15:48.815 --> 15:49.816
Bump right forward,

15:49.816 --> 15:51.517
bump left back,
bump right forward,

15:51.517 --> 15:52.819
bump left back,
bump left forward,

15:52.819 --> 15:57.089
bump right...
Oh, oh, careful!

15:57.089 --> 15:58.891
It's a long way down.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.208
Plus, you have
the security

16:15.208 --> 16:17.176
of living in a
gated community.

16:17.176 --> 16:18.711
Gated community?

16:18.711 --> 16:20.413
That's what you're calling
a drunken guard

16:20.413 --> 16:22.648
stooped over
a chain link fence?

16:22.648 --> 16:25.017
On the plus side, he
never leaves his post.

16:25.017 --> 16:26.352
(squeaking)
Ooh!

16:26.352 --> 16:27.353
You like animals,
don't you?

16:27.353 --> 16:29.055
That was a rat.

16:29.055 --> 16:30.923
You know, I thought I'd get
way more for my money

16:30.923 --> 16:32.091
in the Other Realm.

16:32.091 --> 16:33.526
Well, vermin aside,

16:33.526 --> 16:36.996
you're looking at a house
that is rock solid.

16:39.031 --> 16:40.733
( <i>sighs</i> )

16:40.733 --> 16:44.070
Did I mention that we're
Cloud Ten-adjacent?

16:44.070 --> 16:46.672
Occasionally you get some
riffraff falling from the sky.

16:46.672 --> 16:47.673
Oh, my God.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.775
That riffraff is my niece.

16:49.775 --> 16:50.610
Sabrina?

16:50.610 --> 16:52.645
Okay, you've got
my pager number.

16:52.645 --> 16:53.779
Let me know if you want
to make an offer.

16:53.779 --> 16:55.248
Honey, are you okay?

16:55.248 --> 16:56.115
Yeah.

16:56.115 --> 16:58.784
Yeah, luckily this crappy house
broke my fall.

16:58.784 --> 17:01.187
What were you doing
on Cloud Ten?

17:01.187 --> 17:04.390
Uh... would you believe
the Tush Push?

17:04.390 --> 17:06.692
Sabrina, this is
so unlike you.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.927
What's going on?

17:07.927 --> 17:10.429
Well, I just got
really depressed

17:10.429 --> 17:12.431
because everything
in my life was going wrong

17:12.431 --> 17:14.033
and nobody seemed to care.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.702
You know, everyone was
caught up in their own stuff.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.504
I just felt invisible.

17:18.504 --> 17:20.239
Like you were
the odd man out?

17:20.239 --> 17:22.675
Exactly. You have no idea
how awful it feels.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.744
Actually, honey, I do.

17:24.744 --> 17:27.179
You are looking
at the original odd man out.

17:27.179 --> 17:29.048
Well, odd woman out.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.816
But I dated the odd man out.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.285
Aunt Hilda, your point?

17:32.285 --> 17:35.488
The point is,
I never fit in anywhere.

17:35.488 --> 17:36.989
Your Aunt Zelda was the brainiac

17:36.989 --> 17:39.025
with the gracefulness
of a gazelle.

17:39.025 --> 17:41.994
I was the one with the
funny voice and two left feet.

17:41.994 --> 17:45.264
Good for walking circles,
not so good for buying shoes.

17:45.264 --> 17:46.566
It must have been terrible.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.466
It was.

17:47.466 --> 17:50.369
I did whatever I could
to make myself feel better.

17:50.369 --> 17:51.871
I even went to Cloud Seven.

17:51.871 --> 17:54.440
That was the hip cloud
back then.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.777
Mozart groupies,
mutton on a stick.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.378
Rock me, Amadeus.

17:59.378 --> 18:00.913
So, how did you
tear yourself away

18:00.913 --> 18:05.318
from all that great music
and meat and deal with reality?

18:05.318 --> 18:08.054
I realized that I was looking
for validation.

18:08.054 --> 18:10.623
And that it doesn't come
from the outside.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.459
You've got to reach
inside yourself.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.394
You mean I've got to think
about my problems,

18:15.394 --> 18:17.663
analyze them,
and come up with answers?

18:17.663 --> 18:19.966
No, I mean actually
reach inside yourself.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.734
Here, I'll do it for you.

18:23.970 --> 18:24.837
Talk to her.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.772
She's the only one who
can set you straight.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.342
Me, I've got to go check
out a condo in Purgatory.

18:29.342 --> 18:30.676
It's got a view of Heaven,

18:30.676 --> 18:32.845
and they say the neighborhood
is really coming up.

18:32.845 --> 18:33.946
Bye, honey.

18:35.581 --> 18:38.317
So... here we are.

18:38.317 --> 18:39.785
What do you think
about all this?

18:39.785 --> 18:41.153
I think what you think.

18:41.153 --> 18:43.322
I'm you, the person
we're here to talk about.

18:43.322 --> 18:45.191
What's up?

18:45.191 --> 18:48.127
Well, I want you
to validate me for who I am.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.362
Why should I do that?

18:49.362 --> 18:51.864
Well, um... I'm nice.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.532
Doesn't sound
like you're sure.

18:53.532 --> 18:54.667
Are you or aren't you?

18:54.667 --> 18:55.901
I am!

18:55.901 --> 18:57.136
In what ways?

18:57.136 --> 19:00.539
Well, I'm trustworthy,
loyal...

19:00.539 --> 19:02.908
So far you're a dog.
Keep talking.

19:02.908 --> 19:07.880
Well, I'm considerate,
smart, generous, funny,

19:07.880 --> 19:10.716
loving, creative.

19:10.716 --> 19:11.917
Don't you think?

19:11.917 --> 19:13.352
It doesn't matter
what I think.

19:13.352 --> 19:14.520
If you want this stamp,

19:14.520 --> 19:16.088
then you better not
have any doubts.

19:16.088 --> 19:17.590
This is self-
validation, remember?

19:17.590 --> 19:18.891
Look, here's the bottom line.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.860
I, Sabrina Spellman,
am a good person, okay?

19:20.860 --> 19:23.396
I may not be a published
columnist or a hit on the radio,

19:23.396 --> 19:25.297
but I am a worthy human being

19:25.297 --> 19:26.699
and I don't need anybody else
to tell me that.

19:26.699 --> 19:29.168
Now give me that stamp!

19:29.168 --> 19:32.004
Ow!

19:34.974 --> 19:37.143
What was I thinking?

19:37.143 --> 19:38.678
Why did I even go to Cloud Ten?

19:38.678 --> 19:41.147
It's not like
it changed anything.

19:41.147 --> 19:44.150
And I've got a great life
right here.

19:44.150 --> 19:47.653
Well... maybe not
right here.

19:47.653 --> 19:48.050
( <i>grunts</i> )

19:52.792 --> 19:53.188
( <i>groans</i> )

19:53.188 --> 19:56.062
You think they'd put
guardrails on that cloud.

19:56.062 --> 19:58.931
So, you ready to go back up?

19:58.931 --> 20:00.666
No.

20:00.666 --> 20:03.002
I am through with Cloud Ten.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.005
Sabrina, where
have you been?

20:06.005 --> 20:08.841
Oh, you know,
just doing my thing...

20:08.841 --> 20:10.409
floating around.

20:10.409 --> 20:11.410
I'm glad you're back.

20:11.410 --> 20:13.312
I missed you.

20:13.312 --> 20:14.613
You did?

20:14.613 --> 20:16.449
Well, I-I didn't think you cared

20:16.449 --> 20:18.350
now that you and Morgan
are such good friends.

20:18.350 --> 20:19.351
Hold the phone.

20:19.351 --> 20:20.319
Who's spreading the rumor

20:20.319 --> 20:21.654
that Morgan and I are friends?

20:21.654 --> 20:22.288
Nobody-- it's just that

20:22.288 --> 20:24.523
you guys were laughing
and bonding and buffing.

20:24.523 --> 20:26.859
Sabrina, I'd wax a baboon

20:26.859 --> 20:30.496
if it would make my radio
show more interesting.

20:30.496 --> 20:31.864
I really thought
she was replacing me

20:31.864 --> 20:33.099
as your best friend.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.267
Please, did you fall
on your head or something?

20:35.267 --> 20:37.203
Well, now that you mention it...

20:37.203 --> 20:38.437
Sabrina, I get
a best friend,

20:38.437 --> 20:40.473
like, once every 15 years.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.074
I didn't dump
my Malibu Barbie

20:42.074 --> 20:44.210
and I have no intention
of dumping you.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.678
Thanks.

20:45.678 --> 20:46.979
You still have
your Malibu Barbie?

20:46.979 --> 20:48.547
It's our secret.

20:48.547 --> 20:50.149
We don't have time
to talk about that.

20:50.149 --> 20:52.218
You've got 49 messages
on the machine.

20:52.218 --> 20:53.252
Sabrina, it's Josh.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.387
Great news: Mike wants
to run your article!

20:55.387 --> 20:57.389
Oh, my God, he's
got to be kidding!

20:57.389 --> 20:59.725
I'm not kidding. Call me.

20:59.725 --> 21:01.827
The other 47 are pretty much
the same thing.

21:01.827 --> 21:02.928
Congratulations.

21:02.928 --> 21:03.929
Thanks!

21:03.929 --> 21:05.097
I'm heading over to Josh's.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.198
Oh, wait, before you go...

21:06.198 --> 21:08.768
you might want to wash the stamp
off your forehead.

21:13.506 --> 21:17.743
Here it is,
our new property.

21:17.743 --> 21:19.879
This is a toxic
waste dump.

21:19.879 --> 21:20.813
Now.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.915
But in 400 years,
we'll put up a casino.

21:22.915 --> 21:23.983
We'll be rolling in it.

21:23.983 --> 21:26.719
Hilda, our shoes
are melting. Run!

21:26.719 --> 21:28.521
Did I mention we got
a really good deal?
