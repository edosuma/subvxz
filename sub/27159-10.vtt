00:04.667 --> 00:06.600
I love getting
multiple surgeries.

00:06.633 --> 00:08.200
I mean, if you're going
to be put asleep,

00:08.233 --> 00:10.033
you may as well get
as much done as you can.

00:10.066 --> 00:11.166
I've always kind of
wanted to look

00:11.200 --> 00:12.233
quite cartoon-like.

00:12.266 --> 00:13.367
I want, like,
a Pikachu nose.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.300
You know, like, uh,
like a Pokémon.

00:15.333 --> 00:17.200
We've seen people
that want to look

00:17.233 --> 00:19.433
like celebrities, aliens,
and animated characters,

00:19.467 --> 00:21.300
but never an electric rat.

00:22.533 --> 00:24.400
I have been living
with one breast

00:24.433 --> 00:25.767
for six years.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.367
You have 2 millimeters

00:27.400 --> 00:29.133
of soft tissue.

00:29.166 --> 00:30.567
One cell layer too thick,

00:30.600 --> 00:32.166
I'm into her lung.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.367
One cell layer too thin,

00:33.400 --> 00:34.433
I'm gonna kill

00:34.467 --> 00:36.767
the entire area of skin.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.133
I went in for liposuction,

00:38.166 --> 00:39.600
and I woke up with a new nose.

00:39.633 --> 00:41.400
You know, that's a crime,
by the way.

00:41.433 --> 00:43.533
That's actually
assault and battery.

00:43.567 --> 00:45.400
All the cartilage
from your tip

00:45.433 --> 00:47.467
has been removed.
Your doctor

00:47.500 --> 00:50.333
was a super-villain.

If it's free,
I'm taking it.

01:08.133 --> 01:10.266
I'm Jessie.
I'm from Brazil, Indiana.

01:10.300 --> 01:11.367
I'm 33.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.200
All I wanted was big breasts.

01:13.233 --> 01:15.600
Instead, I'm left
with one D cup breast

01:15.633 --> 01:18.333
and one
negative A cup breast.

01:18.367 --> 01:21.133
After spending $20,000
on my breasts,

01:21.166 --> 01:22.633
I had to come up
with some other way

01:22.667 --> 01:24.166
to save money,

01:24.200 --> 01:26.300
so I learned how to coupon.

01:26.333 --> 01:28.266
You think the doctors
will take coupons?

01:28.300 --> 01:29.467
[laughing]
You find one.

01:29.500 --> 01:30.600
Oh. I found one,

01:30.633 --> 01:32.367
but you
have to go to Mexico.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.667
[both laughing]

01:34.700 --> 01:37.200
In high school,
my boobs were a size A.

01:37.233 --> 01:39.166
I don't think
that my boyfriend
minded at the time

01:39.200 --> 01:40.567
that I had little breasts,

01:40.600 --> 01:42.567
but then there was this girl
with big boobs.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.433
I kind of started
noticing him noticing her.

01:45.467 --> 01:48.667
But nothing ever happened.
My boyfriend and I ended up
moving in together.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.233
We had a child,
we got married,

01:50.266 --> 01:51.667
and we had another child,

01:51.700 --> 01:53.467
but later on I was suspicious

01:53.500 --> 01:55.100
that my husband had been

01:55.133 --> 01:57.033
cheating on me
with the big-boobed girl,

01:57.066 --> 01:59.333
and sure enough
I confirmed it.

01:59.367 --> 02:02.066
I never thought he would
hurt me like that.

02:02.100 --> 02:04.200
I ended up moving on.

02:04.233 --> 02:05.600
I get in a new relationship.

02:05.633 --> 02:06.700
Everything's going great,

02:06.734 --> 02:08.100
and then

02:08.133 --> 02:09.600
he also ends up
cheating on me.

02:09.633 --> 02:12.066
At this point in my life,
I loved two men,

02:12.100 --> 02:14.133
and both of them
cheated on me

02:14.166 --> 02:15.467
with women with big boobs.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.300
I was 26 years old,

02:17.333 --> 02:19.433
and I decided
enough is enough.

02:19.467 --> 02:21.300
Maybe having bigger boobs

02:21.333 --> 02:23.200
would make my chances
less likely

02:23.233 --> 02:24.633
of somebody cheating on me.

02:24.667 --> 02:26.233
It does sound a little crazy,

02:26.266 --> 02:27.400
now that I'm
thinking about it.

02:27.433 --> 02:28.633
I found my doctor.

02:28.667 --> 02:30.200
I told her I was like,
"You know what?

02:30.233 --> 02:31.300
Just go as big
as you can go."

02:31.333 --> 02:32.333
When I woke up from surgery,

02:32.367 --> 02:33.367
I was like, "Oh, my God.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.600
I got big boobs."

02:34.633 --> 02:36.600
But then, two weeks later,

02:36.633 --> 02:37.700
the implant

02:37.734 --> 02:39.600
ended up started
to come through.

02:39.633 --> 02:42.066
My skin and incision
started opening.

02:42.100 --> 02:44.200
The doctor said,
"We've got to take it out."

02:44.233 --> 02:45.533
She's like, "It'll be okay.

02:45.567 --> 02:47.734
"After it's all healed up,
then we'll end up--

02:47.767 --> 02:49.367
We'll put another implant in."

02:49.400 --> 02:52.100
This happened not once
but three times.

02:52.133 --> 02:54.100
It was absolutely
heartbreaking.

02:54.133 --> 02:57.600
So I have been living with
one breast for six years,

02:57.633 --> 02:59.633
and nobody has seen
under my shirt.

02:59.667 --> 03:01.633
There isn't a day
that goes by

03:01.667 --> 03:03.600
when I don't regret
getting my boobs done

03:03.633 --> 03:05.266
just to keep a man.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.700
I don't even care
about meeting anybody.

03:07.734 --> 03:10.166
Like, I just want
to live free,

03:10.200 --> 03:12.600
not trapped by this breast.

03:12.633 --> 03:15.500
It consumes
so much of my life.

03:15.533 --> 03:17.500
I've been wearing
this one piece of gauze

03:17.533 --> 03:19.500
for four years.
I tried to make a new one

03:19.533 --> 03:21.233
because this one's
disgusting,

03:21.266 --> 03:23.533
and none of them
can come out right.

03:23.567 --> 03:25.533
I don't know what it was

03:25.567 --> 03:27.567
about that one time
that I made this,

03:27.600 --> 03:28.667
but it is

03:28.700 --> 03:30.567
freakin' on point.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.400
We're gonna
have to go back

03:32.433 --> 03:33.667
and get some more
toilet paper.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.600
[sighs]
That was a good deal.

03:35.633 --> 03:38.266
I felt Jessie was fine
the way she was.

03:38.300 --> 03:40.533
I'm sure she regrets it now,

03:40.567 --> 03:42.734
but she's just embarrassed,
and she does feel bad

03:42.767 --> 03:45.633
'cause she did this
basically to herself.

03:45.667 --> 03:47.200
I have to worry

03:47.233 --> 03:49.266
is this implant
gonna fall out

03:49.300 --> 03:50.633
like the other three did.

03:50.667 --> 03:52.533
Yeah. That's what
I'm worried about.

03:52.567 --> 03:54.266
God, to go through
it again-- ooh.

03:56.266 --> 03:57.333
I'm Sallie Axl,

03:57.367 --> 03:58.767
and I'm a DJ from the UK.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.700
My nose is wonky, bumpy,

04:00.734 --> 04:03.133
and downright [bleep].

04:03.166 --> 04:04.500
I love getting
multiple surgeries.

04:04.533 --> 04:05.700
I mean, if you're gonna
get put asleep,

04:05.734 --> 04:07.700
you may as well get
as much done as you can.

04:07.734 --> 04:09.166
In the last 12 months,

04:09.200 --> 04:10.333
I've had my second boob job,

04:10.367 --> 04:11.433
third nose job,

04:11.467 --> 04:12.567
and then I had my BBL,

04:12.600 --> 04:14.500
lipo, and bum implants.

04:14.533 --> 04:16.700
I've always kind of wanted
to look quite cartoon-like.

04:16.734 --> 04:18.633
Jessica Rabbit's body
is just phenomenal.

04:18.667 --> 04:20.300
I know
it's not a real person,

04:20.333 --> 04:23.400
but I think she's, like,
a proper little idol.

04:23.433 --> 04:24.700
My body's really strong,

04:24.734 --> 04:26.667
and I can actually
handle surgery so well.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.333
I mean, it was only
six weeks ago

04:28.367 --> 04:29.633
I had my, um, bum implants,

04:29.667 --> 04:31.300
and I'm sitting today, so--

04:31.333 --> 04:32.667
Social media's
so important to me.

04:32.700 --> 04:35.000
The more plastic surgery
equals more followers

04:35.033 --> 04:37.533
and equals more people
coming to my DJ'ing gigs.

04:37.567 --> 04:39.200
When I was a child,

04:39.233 --> 04:40.433
I just wanted
to be a performer,

04:40.467 --> 04:41.734
so when I was 16,

04:41.767 --> 04:43.767
I decided to be
a fire performer.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.700
No one try this
at home, right?

04:45.734 --> 04:47.433
So I had a few drinks,

04:47.467 --> 04:48.700
and then I put barbecue fluid

04:48.734 --> 04:50.700
or something, uh, in my mouth,

04:50.734 --> 04:54.433
and then I spat it out
with a stick of fire

04:54.467 --> 04:57.633
and literally blew and run.
[laughing]

04:57.667 --> 04:59.600
I think being a performer
does make you

04:59.633 --> 05:02.200
a bit more conscious
about your appearance.

05:02.233 --> 05:03.400
When you're on a stage,

05:03.433 --> 05:05.333
everyone is just focused
on, like, you.

05:05.367 --> 05:06.600
Don't want to look
like the ugly one.

05:06.633 --> 05:09.500
So I decided I need
to revamp myself definitely.

05:09.533 --> 05:11.467
And so I had
closed nose surgery,

05:11.500 --> 05:14.200
and I had my breasts done.

05:14.233 --> 05:15.533
When I woke up,
I looked at my boobs,

05:15.567 --> 05:17.333
and they were nice
for natural-looking boobs,

05:17.367 --> 05:18.567
but when I looked at my nose,

05:18.600 --> 05:19.567
there wasn't much difference.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.600
It wasn't

05:20.633 --> 05:22.400
the tiny nose I'd wanted.

05:22.433 --> 05:24.600
So I had my second nose job.

05:24.633 --> 05:26.300
Three years later,

05:26.333 --> 05:28.467
I decided to get
my boobs done again.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.333
When I went for my
consultation with him,

05:30.367 --> 05:32.233
he looked at my nose,
and he said, like,

05:32.266 --> 05:34.600
[German accent]
"Your nose has collapsed,"
in that accent.

05:34.633 --> 05:36.767
So he'd offered me
a revision.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.633
Well, I thought, mm,
it is for free,

05:38.667 --> 05:40.333
and he can't go wrong

05:40.367 --> 05:42.033
and do it wrong
three times in a row.

05:42.066 --> 05:44.500
Surely he could
do it right this time.

05:44.533 --> 05:47.767
He said he'd had to take
some of my rib

05:48.000 --> 05:49.400
and put into my nose.

05:49.433 --> 05:50.500
Well, that was a bit stupid

05:50.533 --> 05:51.767
because now I have

05:52.000 --> 05:53.300
a sausage drip

05:53.333 --> 05:55.233
that sticks out on my nose.

05:55.266 --> 05:57.767
The worst nose ever,
and I hate it.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.467
I'd like my nose to look
like a little, small,
cute little button nose.

06:01.500 --> 06:02.567
I'm seeing Dr. Nassif

06:02.600 --> 06:04.767
because he is the best
in noses,

06:05.000 --> 06:06.767
and I'd like to speak
with Dr. Dubrow,

06:07.000 --> 06:08.400
um, about heel implants.

06:08.433 --> 06:10.300
I think a few inches
could really help me.

06:10.333 --> 06:11.400
I am never close to perfection

06:11.433 --> 06:12.467
because
there's always something

06:12.500 --> 06:13.533
to be more perfect,

06:13.567 --> 06:15.767
like at 35 I want a face lift,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.100
and I want my eyebrows
lifted already.

06:18.133 --> 06:19.400
I'd like
a little chin implant,

06:19.433 --> 06:20.633
you know, to make
that, like, thing.

06:20.667 --> 06:22.600
So I think
the faker, the better.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.333
I don't want to look natural.

06:24.367 --> 06:26.266
What's perfect to me
is small nose, little waist,

06:26.300 --> 06:29.367
big boobs, big lips,
and a big ass.

By the way,
I never thought

06:35.567 --> 06:37.533
about what my butt
looked like

06:37.567 --> 06:39.500
until you started
talking my butt,

06:39.533 --> 06:42.000
and now I actually
get out of the shower,

06:42.033 --> 06:43.266
walk by the mirror,

06:43.300 --> 06:45.000
and I used to just
look at my chest

06:45.033 --> 06:46.266
and my abs and my arms.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.667
and I actually
look at my butt now,

06:47.700 --> 06:49.400
and I'm mildly disgusted
with my butt.

06:49.433 --> 06:50.600
Because I did this to you.

06:50.633 --> 06:52.400
Because
you did this to me.

06:52.433 --> 06:53.700
You've basically given me
a butt complex.

06:53.734 --> 06:55.033
I don't feel bad

06:55.066 --> 06:56.567
about giving Terry
a butt complex

06:56.600 --> 06:57.700
because he's been

06:57.734 --> 06:59.367
spending many years

06:59.400 --> 07:02.066
giving me
a hairy chest complex,

07:02.100 --> 07:04.100
a fat body complex,

07:04.133 --> 07:07.033
a face complex,
a thumb complex,

07:07.066 --> 07:08.667
so screw it.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.033
So our next patient

07:10.066 --> 07:11.700
is a woman named Jessie.

07:11.734 --> 07:15.567
Okay? And Jessie has had
multiple breast surgeries.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.000
Mm-hmm. Oh.

07:17.033 --> 07:18.700
This is basically
a breast cripple.

07:18.734 --> 07:20.100
Is she
in the medical field?

07:20.133 --> 07:22.467
Yeah.
So let's bring her in.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.500
You know, this is a really
hard breast case.

07:24.533 --> 07:26.133
Can you please send in Jessie?

07:26.166 --> 07:27.767
Okay.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.100
Jessie.
Hello.

07:29.133 --> 07:30.433
How are you, Jessie?
Dr. Nassif.

07:30.467 --> 07:31.734
Good. How are you?

07:31.767 --> 07:33.667
It's so surreal meeting
the doctors that could

07:33.700 --> 07:35.166
actually give me hope.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.700
I don't care about the size.

07:36.734 --> 07:37.734
I just want

07:37.767 --> 07:39.700
a little something there.

07:39.734 --> 07:41.400
Are you in the medical field?

07:41.433 --> 07:42.400
I am.

07:42.433 --> 07:43.600
You know
how we knew that?

07:43.633 --> 07:45.100
How's that?
One of your pictures,

07:45.133 --> 07:46.600
you looked like you
were wearing scrubs.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.133
Oh, yes.
What do you do?

07:48.166 --> 07:49.734
I am a CNA cum aide.

07:49.767 --> 07:51.600
Okay, nurse assistant.
Yes.

07:51.633 --> 07:52.767
You've had
a lot of problems.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.533
Yes.
So you've got to tell us.

07:54.567 --> 07:56.100
How did this all happen?

07:56.133 --> 07:57.667
I've had relationships,

07:57.700 --> 07:59.734
but it's been heartbreaking.

07:59.767 --> 08:02.734
Both my exes cheated on me
with girls with big boobs,

08:02.767 --> 08:06.367
so on my 26th birthday
I got big boobs done.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.734
[Jessie, Becky laugh]
[Dubrow]
Okay.

08:07.767 --> 08:09.667
It's not really a great

08:09.700 --> 08:11.667
reason for having
plastic surgery

08:11.700 --> 08:13.700
because you should
love yourself first

08:13.734 --> 08:14.767
and understand

08:15.000 --> 08:16.667
that complications can occur

08:16.700 --> 08:19.400
and you can end up worse
than when you started.

08:19.433 --> 08:20.767
How large did you
tell the doctor?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.734
I said, "Just go
as big as you can go."

08:22.767 --> 08:25.166
Two weeks later, busted open.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.500
So they just pull it out?

08:26.533 --> 08:27.633
Yes. Left it out,

08:27.667 --> 08:29.734
sewed me back up,
put a drain into me,

08:29.767 --> 08:31.000
sent me on my way.

08:31.033 --> 08:32.633
Probably
about a month later,

08:32.667 --> 08:35.500
I had a tremendous
sharp pain going on,

08:35.533 --> 08:37.000
and I went
into the bathroom,

08:37.033 --> 08:38.734
and all I see
was black underneath.

08:38.767 --> 08:40.066
Tissue was dying.

08:40.100 --> 08:42.400
No. It was the implant.
Oh.

08:42.433 --> 08:43.767
See, if you
get too superficial

08:44.000 --> 08:46.500
and don't leave enough
soft tissue coverage,

08:46.533 --> 08:48.767
the overlying skin doesn't
have enough blood supply

08:49.000 --> 08:50.133
to stay alive.

08:50.166 --> 08:51.633
It breaks down,

08:51.667 --> 08:53.533
and ptchoo,
the implant pops through.

08:53.567 --> 08:54.767
What's concerting
about Jessie

08:55.000 --> 08:56.734
is that her implant
exposed

08:56.767 --> 08:58.600
in a relatively short

08:58.633 --> 09:00.066
period of time,

09:00.100 --> 09:02.667
and that may indicate, 1,

09:02.700 --> 09:05.000
a very poorly done
operative procedure,

09:05.033 --> 09:08.667
or 2, really bad
underlying soft tissue.

09:08.700 --> 09:11.433
So how long did you wait
before doing the next thing?

09:11.467 --> 09:12.633
We waited a while.

09:12.667 --> 09:15.133
She wanted to do
a fat graft at this point.

09:15.166 --> 09:16.667
She wanted
to thicken up the area.
Yes.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.467
That took, like, a year
because I had to eat

09:18.500 --> 09:19.767
and eat and eat,
try to gain weight,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.166
along with-- I think
it's called a belladerm.

09:22.200 --> 09:26.000
You had a reinforced
lining put in--
Yes.

09:26.033 --> 09:29.233
...to try to thicken up
the inside of the pocket

09:29.266 --> 09:30.533
to give more protection.
Yes.

09:30.567 --> 09:31.667
Okay. That's
a very good idea.

09:31.700 --> 09:33.767
Along with an expandable

09:34.000 --> 09:35.200
implant this time.

09:35.233 --> 09:36.533
So you're in the medical
profession.

09:36.567 --> 09:39.066
Aren't you starting
to wonder, hmm?

09:39.100 --> 09:41.433
She made me believe
that it was me,

09:41.467 --> 09:44.533
that I did it with my scrubs,
something, you know.

09:44.567 --> 09:47.633
Pulling them off caused maybe
an infection or something.

09:47.667 --> 09:49.567
Did it convince you?
It did, obviously.
I went back there.

09:49.600 --> 09:50.600
I'm gonna use that one.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.567
Uh, that makes no sense.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.633
What do scrubs,
and the way they fit,

09:55.667 --> 09:58.433
have to do
with implant exposure?

09:58.467 --> 09:59.433
Nah.

09:59.467 --> 10:00.567
So then

10:00.600 --> 10:02.100
she put the tissue
expander in.

10:02.133 --> 10:03.166
And it came out.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.266
Exposed again?
Yes.

10:04.300 --> 10:05.767
So she took it out.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.033
She said, "I'm gonna need
time to think on this."

10:08.066 --> 10:10.166
And so you've done
nothing since.
No.

10:10.200 --> 10:13.500
Jessie's had
some very significant
early complications,

10:13.533 --> 10:16.200
despite the fact
that her surgeon used
preventative measures.

10:16.233 --> 10:18.633
We need
to figure out a way

10:18.667 --> 10:20.200
to thicken up that skin

10:20.233 --> 10:21.734
if we have any chance

10:22.000 --> 10:24.633
of having an implant
survive in that pocket

10:24.667 --> 10:26.300
for any period of time.

10:26.333 --> 10:27.600
So let's
go in the exam room

10:27.633 --> 10:29.200
and figure out
what has happened.

10:29.233 --> 10:31.266
Okay.
Okay? All right.
Good. Come on.

10:32.233 --> 10:33.266
I think the chance

10:33.300 --> 10:35.266
that it would fail

10:35.300 --> 10:38.133
is 60%.

10:38.166 --> 10:40.066
God,
that's a scary thought.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.567
I wouldn't
want to hear that.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.066
You're telling me

10:43.100 --> 10:45.133
the plastic surgeon
operated on your nose

10:45.166 --> 10:46.500
unbeknownst to you
while you were
under anesthesia?

10:46.533 --> 10:47.633
You know,
that's a crime.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.066
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

10:58.133 --> 11:00.700
Let's start with the sort of
more normal breast,

11:00.734 --> 11:01.700
okay?
Okay.

11:01.734 --> 11:03.633
From here up,

11:03.667 --> 11:05.266
it sort of looks normal.
Yeah.

11:05.300 --> 11:07.533
This is sort of
the double bubble.

11:07.567 --> 11:10.033
That's one of those setups,

11:10.066 --> 11:12.233
if you put too big
an implant in,

11:12.266 --> 11:14.367
that you're gonna
get a double bubble,

11:14.400 --> 11:17.533
distortion,
and unfortunately,

11:17.567 --> 11:20.367
if you get a little
too superficial exposure.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.667
Jessie should never have
had such large implants

11:22.700 --> 11:23.767
put in the first place.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.066
Her left implant,

11:25.100 --> 11:26.533
although it never exposed,

11:26.567 --> 11:29.567
still has a very significant
complication

11:29.600 --> 11:32.000
that requires major
reconstructive surgery.

11:32.033 --> 11:34.100
Let's be clinical
detectives here.

11:34.133 --> 11:36.767
Okay.
So it's, like,
paper thin, isn't it,

11:37.000 --> 11:38.567
Right directly--
It's--
That's on her rib.

11:38.600 --> 11:39.667
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.233
In terms of thickness,

11:41.266 --> 11:45.700
we like to have 2 centimeters
above the breast implant.

11:45.734 --> 11:49.300
You have 2 millimeters
of soft tissue

11:49.333 --> 11:51.233
overlying
this lower portion.

11:51.266 --> 11:52.767
You are a little bit
of a victim

11:53.000 --> 11:54.400
of a surgical misadventure.

11:54.433 --> 11:56.233
[Nassif]
I've never seen
skin that thin

11:56.266 --> 11:57.400
of all the ones
I've seen you do,

11:57.433 --> 11:58.767
and I've seen you
so hundreds.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.200
God,
that's a scary thought.

12:00.233 --> 12:02.033
This is really paper thin.

12:02.066 --> 12:03.200
I wouldn't
want to hear that.

12:03.233 --> 12:05.667
This is gonna be
a difficult case.

12:05.700 --> 12:07.200
Maybe the thing to do

12:07.233 --> 12:10.333
is to go in there
and two-stage this--

12:10.367 --> 12:11.700
lift everything up,

12:11.734 --> 12:15.700
sew a piece of soft tissue
reinforcement in

12:15.734 --> 12:19.233
to allow the ingrowth
of scar tissue

12:19.266 --> 12:20.400
to thicken up the area,

12:20.433 --> 12:22.166
and put a little implant
in there

12:22.200 --> 12:26.166
just to keep the tissue
spaces separated.

12:26.200 --> 12:29.767
Then we go back
in a short period of time

12:30.000 --> 12:33.300
and then go in and put
a regular-sized implant in.

12:33.333 --> 12:36.600
I think the chance
that it would fail

12:36.633 --> 12:39.367
is 60%.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.633
Even if I had,
like, a 5% chance

12:41.667 --> 12:43.000
that maybe it might work,

12:43.033 --> 12:44.166
I would still
want to do it.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.066
I don't have
anything to lose.

12:46.100 --> 12:47.700
The worst thing
that's gonna happen

12:47.734 --> 12:49.133
is that it's gonna fail

12:49.166 --> 12:50.333
and this one's gonna come out,

12:50.367 --> 12:51.633
so why not give it a chance?

12:51.667 --> 12:53.166
Every year,

12:53.200 --> 12:54.633
we have that one case,

12:54.667 --> 12:56.066
the one
you'll never forget.

12:56.100 --> 12:58.333
Do you want to be that case?

12:58.367 --> 12:59.333
Yeah.
In my world?

12:59.367 --> 13:00.367
Please.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.400
Well, congratulations.

13:02.433 --> 13:04.433
You're the hardest case
in my world.

13:04.467 --> 13:06.400
Thank you.
You made it.

13:08.333 --> 13:09.433
One of the things

13:09.467 --> 13:11.266
that really bothers me
about my nose,

13:11.300 --> 13:14.367
um, it's the fact
that it's pinched here

13:14.400 --> 13:17.700
and there's a bulge
that comes out

13:17.734 --> 13:19.667
and protrudes on this side.

13:19.700 --> 13:22.066
My name is Mariela.
I'm 41 years old.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.300
I went in for liposuction,

13:23.333 --> 13:24.767
and I woke up
with a new nose,

13:25.000 --> 13:26.700
and this is what I'm
left with.

13:26.734 --> 13:28.033
Growing up was hard.

13:28.066 --> 13:29.233
I was always a little chubby.

13:29.266 --> 13:31.200
I was bullied in school
for that.

13:31.233 --> 13:32.233
When I was 19,

13:32.266 --> 13:33.367
I had been planning a trip

13:33.400 --> 13:34.734
to visit my family in Peru,

13:34.767 --> 13:36.100
and I decided to have

13:36.133 --> 13:37.233
a little liposuction
on my stomach

13:37.266 --> 13:38.300
while I was there.

13:38.333 --> 13:39.400
I met with the doctor

13:39.433 --> 13:40.767
the day after I arrived,

13:41.000 --> 13:42.166
and he was
a very famous doctor.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.033
He was like
the Beverly Hills doctor

13:44.066 --> 13:45.133
of Peru.

13:45.166 --> 13:46.266
When I talked to him

13:46.300 --> 13:47.700
and I explained
what I wanted,

13:47.734 --> 13:49.066
he said it was really easy

13:49.100 --> 13:50.667
and he could do it
the next day.

13:50.700 --> 13:52.300
When I woke up,

13:52.333 --> 13:54.133
I had a cast over my nose.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.767
Right after the surgery,
I saw the doctor,

13:56.000 --> 13:57.700
and he said that they
did us a favor.

13:57.734 --> 13:59.033
I was pissed.

13:59.066 --> 14:00.667
I had absolutely no issues

14:00.700 --> 14:02.500
with my nose
before the surgery.

14:02.533 --> 14:04.133
It was the nose
I was born with,

14:04.166 --> 14:05.734
and I liked it.

14:05.767 --> 14:07.400
Because I had the cast on,

14:07.433 --> 14:10.200
I didn't know
how bad the damage was.

14:10.233 --> 14:12.266
He said, "It's swollen now,
but it will look great."

14:12.300 --> 14:14.266
But, when the bandages
came off,

14:14.300 --> 14:16.033
what I saw horrified me.

14:16.066 --> 14:19.000
We never saw the doctor
who operated on me again.

14:19.033 --> 14:21.467
So later on I found out
that he had gotten arrested

14:21.500 --> 14:25.133
for giving people surgeries
that they didn't ask for,

14:25.166 --> 14:28.266
and he killed
his girlfriend in the OR.

14:28.300 --> 14:31.100
The doctor was convicted
for most of his crimes

14:31.133 --> 14:33.400
and was sent to prison,
and he died there.

14:33.433 --> 14:35.433
When I came back,
funny enough,

14:35.467 --> 14:37.467
I ended up working
for a plastic surgeon.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.533
He was a nose specialist.

14:39.567 --> 14:41.734
I remember him saying,

14:41.767 --> 14:43.166
"Oh, that nose.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.400
Many times would he
walk by my desk,

14:45.433 --> 14:47.166
but he never offered to help.

14:47.200 --> 14:50.166
I think everybody
that has body image issues

14:50.200 --> 14:52.433
sometimes go through
the world wondering

14:52.467 --> 14:54.367
and thinking people
are talking about them,

14:54.400 --> 14:56.266
but to actually hear it back,

14:56.300 --> 14:57.767
that really messes
with your head.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.533
Remember I told you
about the appointment

14:59.567 --> 15:01.133
that I wanted to do

15:01.166 --> 15:02.300
with Dr. Nassif
and Dr. Dubrow?

15:02.333 --> 15:03.367
Yes.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.166
I'm excited, I'm positive,

15:05.200 --> 15:06.367
but I'm also prepared
for the no,

15:06.400 --> 15:08.266
but I want the yes.
Of course.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.700
If Dr. Nassif
and Dr. Dubrow

15:10.734 --> 15:12.100
say yes to Mariela,

15:12.133 --> 15:13.433
there will be a big change

15:13.467 --> 15:14.734
in, uh, Mariela's life.

15:14.767 --> 15:16.467
When are you going?
Next week.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.133
You can come with me
if you want.

15:18.166 --> 15:20.066
I would like to be with you.
Yeah. Yeah.

15:20.100 --> 15:21.433
I feel like,
if I fix my nose,

15:21.467 --> 15:23.300
I am finally gonna be able

15:23.333 --> 15:25.567
to not worry
about bullies.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.400
I would love to have
my old nose back, if possible.

15:27.433 --> 15:30.133
If not, better and improved.

15:30.166 --> 15:31.567
I'm excited.
I'm glad for you.

15:36.367 --> 15:38.767
So our next patient Mariela,
she was bullied,

15:39.000 --> 15:42.066
and somehow it led her
to a very bad rhinoplasty.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.333
Let's take a look
at her photos.
Okay.

15:43.367 --> 15:45.333
Ooh.
Well, how many
surgeries is this,

15:45.367 --> 15:47.066
do you think?
I don't know.

15:47.100 --> 15:48.100
This looks like four,
five, or six.

15:48.133 --> 15:49.166
Let's get her in here.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.000
Can you please send in Mariela?

15:52.100 --> 15:53.533
Hello.
Mariela, nice to meet you.

15:53.567 --> 15:55.033
Very nice to meet you.

15:55.066 --> 15:56.200
I've been wanting
to fix my nose

15:56.233 --> 15:57.300
for the past 20 years.

15:57.333 --> 15:58.500
As hard as it is

15:58.533 --> 16:00.100
to trust a doctor again,

16:00.133 --> 16:02.066
I have to give myself
that chance.

16:02.100 --> 16:03.467
We know a story that,
when you were younger,

16:03.500 --> 16:05.100
having a body image issue

16:05.133 --> 16:06.567
which led
to plastic surgery.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.767
When I was, uh, 19 or 20,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.166
a friend of mine was like,
"You should do liposuction,"

16:11.200 --> 16:14.333
and I decided to go to Peru
to see the very famous doctor.

16:14.367 --> 16:16.433
Because I was only there
for two weeks,

16:16.467 --> 16:18.133
I told him, I said,
"I'm pressed for time.

16:18.166 --> 16:19.500
Do you think you can
do this liposuction?"

16:19.533 --> 16:21.100
He said,
"We can do it tomorrow."

16:21.133 --> 16:22.600
And then I woke up,

16:22.633 --> 16:25.100
and this huge thing
on my nose.

16:25.133 --> 16:27.300
I didn't feel anything here

16:27.333 --> 16:29.266
because the pain was here.

16:29.300 --> 16:31.066
You're telling me

16:31.100 --> 16:34.266
that the plastic surgeon
operated on your nose

16:34.300 --> 16:35.567
unbeknownst to you while you
were under anesthesia?

16:35.600 --> 16:37.400
You know, that's a crime,
by the way.

16:37.433 --> 16:39.467
That's actually
assault and battery.

16:39.500 --> 16:42.533
Performing unconsented surgery
is considered battery

16:42.567 --> 16:45.000
because the patient
can't voice her opinion.

16:45.033 --> 16:46.266
They're unconscious.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.533
The big reveal was when they
took the cast off.

16:48.567 --> 16:53.133
I was devastated because
I had had so many issues
growing up being fat,

16:53.166 --> 16:55.567
and then here I have now--
[Nassif]
Switch from that to this.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.133
...a problem that I
didn't have.

16:57.166 --> 16:59.467
How is this affecting
your day-to-day life?

16:59.500 --> 17:01.266
I found out not too long ago--

17:01.300 --> 17:03.233
There was this group
of friends that we had,

17:03.266 --> 17:05.300
and one of them
had been calling me

17:05.333 --> 17:07.266
"pig nose" behind my back.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.266
And to, at this age,

17:09.300 --> 17:11.500
have people that are still
making comments about that,

17:11.533 --> 17:14.533
it kind of reassures me
that yeah, people are
still looking at my nose.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.500
What are your goals
with surgery,

17:16.533 --> 17:18.000
if you were gonna have it?

17:18.033 --> 17:19.633
I don't want
to have to wonder,

17:19.667 --> 17:22.467
every time I meet somebody
or whatever job I have,

17:22.500 --> 17:24.166
if people are looking
at my nose.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.166
So you're-- Basically,
what you're saying is

17:26.200 --> 17:28.433
you're completely,
completely self-conscious,

17:28.467 --> 17:30.567
insecure about your nose.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.333
Yes.
In my opinion,

17:32.367 --> 17:34.066
there's only one person,
honestly--

17:34.100 --> 17:35.367
I'm really hoping
you say it's him.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.500
It's him.

17:37.667 --> 17:40.500
I really depend
on Heidi's eyes

17:40.533 --> 17:43.233
and her hand to give me
warning about it.

17:43.266 --> 17:45.033
It looks like,
from the outer surface,

17:45.066 --> 17:47.433
I'm getting too thin.
[bleep].

17:47.467 --> 17:49.133
Now I just want
to be made taller.

17:49.166 --> 17:50.166
I've heard that you can get,

17:50.200 --> 17:51.233
like, some mad, like, implant?

17:51.266 --> 17:52.467
It's like a foot stiletto.

17:52.500 --> 17:53.567
How tall
do you want to be?

17:53.600 --> 17:55.066
I think about 5'7".

17:55.100 --> 17:56.166
I think
it's absolutely bonkers

17:56.200 --> 17:57.433
that she wants
heel implants.

17:57.467 --> 17:58.600
It's creepy as hell.

18:01.734 --> 18:04.166
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

18:05.467 --> 18:06.700
[Nassif]
So-- Ooh.

18:06.734 --> 18:08.567
Okay, looking up close,
you took the makeup off.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.533
You have a lot
of broken blood vessels.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.400
You look like you've
had at least four
or five surgeries.

18:12.433 --> 18:14.133
Yeah.
I was very shocked

18:14.166 --> 18:15.567
to hear that, um,
Dr. Nassif thought

18:15.600 --> 18:17.600
that I had
multiple surgeries.

18:17.633 --> 18:20.767
I knew it was bad,
but hearing it from an expert
really shocked me.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.266
So all the cartilage
from your tip--

18:23.300 --> 18:24.533
I don't feel,
actually, any of it.

18:24.567 --> 18:25.533
It feels like it's
been removed.

18:25.567 --> 18:26.734
So in your situation,

18:26.767 --> 18:28.233
the doctor
did numerous things

18:28.266 --> 18:29.433
that are too aggressive.

18:29.467 --> 18:31.300
1, scooped you out.

18:31.333 --> 18:32.767
Took away
too much of your hump.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.400
In addition, took all
the tip cartilage away,

18:35.433 --> 18:37.500
and that's why the nose
has been rotated up,

18:37.533 --> 18:40.166
and that's why you've been
called a piggy nose.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.533
The good news is
your skin is mobile

18:42.567 --> 18:44.367
because
we want to stretch it

18:44.400 --> 18:47.200
so we can lower it
and build it up.

18:47.233 --> 18:49.300
Getting my nose fixed
will be life changing.

18:49.333 --> 18:51.667
I'm ready to get rid
of this piggy face

18:51.700 --> 18:53.400
and get my old nose back.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.600
I have news for you.

18:54.633 --> 18:58.200
Your doctor
was a super-villain.

18:58.233 --> 18:59.433
But fortunately,

18:59.467 --> 19:02.266
we have truly a superhero.
Superhero.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.400
Terry, did you
call me a superhero?

19:04.433 --> 19:06.367
You're so sweet.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.633
Let me hear one good
"I'm in."

19:07.667 --> 19:09.000
I'm in!
There we go.

19:09.033 --> 19:11.367
[all laugh]
That's good. Pleasure.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.433
[Dubrow]
Jessie.
Hey.

19:14.467 --> 19:15.767
How are you?
Good.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.667
So she has neoskin,

19:17.700 --> 19:21.567
which is basically
like a single-cell layer,

19:21.600 --> 19:24.033
uh, of scar,
underneath the areola

19:24.066 --> 19:25.734
with a contracted
breast under that.

19:25.767 --> 19:29.033
Elevating up Jessie's
lower right breast skin

19:29.066 --> 19:31.600
is basically
extraordinarily dangerous.

19:31.633 --> 19:34.734
One cell layer too thick,
I'm into her lung.

19:34.767 --> 19:36.533
One cell layer too thin,

19:36.567 --> 19:39.367
I'm gonna kill
the entire area of skin.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.767
For Jessie's surgery today,

19:45.000 --> 19:46.600
I'll begin
by making an incision

19:46.633 --> 19:48.333
in her right lower breast

19:48.367 --> 19:51.000
and elevate up
her extremely thin skin.

19:51.033 --> 19:53.333
I'll then rotate
a piece of tissue

19:53.367 --> 19:55.333
from the back part
of the pocket

19:55.367 --> 19:57.734
to reinforce the thin
part of her skin.

19:57.767 --> 20:00.467
Next I'll insert
a very small implant

20:00.500 --> 20:02.233
to fill the breast pocket

20:02.266 --> 20:03.667
and hopefully allow the skin

20:03.700 --> 20:05.567
to heal and thicken up.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.367
On the left side,

20:07.400 --> 20:09.333
I'll make an incision
under the left areola

20:09.367 --> 20:11.066
and remove her large implant.

20:11.100 --> 20:14.533
I'll then insert a smaller
implant for symmetry,

20:14.567 --> 20:17.066
and hopefully
Jessie will heal

20:17.100 --> 20:18.600
so we can give her
larger breasts

20:18.633 --> 20:19.633
in the near future.

20:19.667 --> 20:21.033
This has to be done

20:21.066 --> 20:22.633
extraordinarily carefully.

20:22.667 --> 20:26.667
I really depend
on Heidi's eyes and her hand

20:26.700 --> 20:28.066
to give me warning about it.

20:28.100 --> 20:29.700
It looks like,
from the outer surface,

20:29.734 --> 20:31.300
I'm getting too thin.

20:31.333 --> 20:33.533
As I'm dissecting
the scar tissue

20:33.567 --> 20:34.667
from the inside,

20:34.700 --> 20:37.367
Heidi is looking
on the outside

20:37.400 --> 20:39.467
and can determine
whether I'm getting

20:39.500 --> 20:41.734
too close to the surface
of the skin,

20:41.767 --> 20:45.333
which could potentially
reduce the blood supply
to the skin

20:45.367 --> 20:47.266
and cause the skin to die.

20:47.300 --> 20:50.033
We elevated up the skin.
Didn't get into the lung.

20:50.066 --> 20:51.567
So what we're trying to do

20:51.600 --> 20:54.100
is rotate up a piece of tissue

20:54.133 --> 20:55.633
from the back part
of the pocket,

20:55.667 --> 20:57.667
sort of what we call
the back wall,

20:57.700 --> 21:00.066
to line the pocket with

21:00.100 --> 21:02.667
where the skin is really bad.

21:02.700 --> 21:03.734
Do we have any alloderm?

21:03.767 --> 21:04.767
Yeah.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.400
So ever though we have

21:06.433 --> 21:08.300
a really nice vascularized
piece of tissue,

21:08.333 --> 21:09.734
this area is so thin,

21:09.767 --> 21:11.567
I'm also gonna reinforce it
with some mesh.

21:11.600 --> 21:14.667
Even though mesh is
an actual foreign body,

21:14.700 --> 21:17.567
it's designed
specifically to be used

21:17.600 --> 21:19.600
to cause scar tissue
to grow into an area,

21:19.633 --> 21:21.734
thicken it up even further,

21:21.767 --> 21:23.367
and give you
a greater chance

21:23.400 --> 21:24.667
of the success of surgery.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.400
So I'm gonna put
a little implant in,

21:26.433 --> 21:28.400
just to keep a spacer,

21:28.433 --> 21:30.000
just to allow this to heal,

21:30.033 --> 21:31.767
with the idea of, hopefully,

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
this won't break down
and we can come back later.

21:34.033 --> 21:35.567
Okay, so I think
what we're gonna do

21:35.600 --> 21:38.400
is put a small implant
on this side

21:38.433 --> 21:41.433
and at least start
to get symmetry.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.100
When downsizing implants,

21:43.133 --> 21:46.033
capsular contracture can
actually be your friend

21:46.066 --> 21:47.333
by thickening up

21:47.367 --> 21:49.000
the surrounding
breast tissue,

21:49.033 --> 21:52.033
allowing you to put
a larger breast implant

21:52.066 --> 21:53.734
at a second stage later.

21:53.767 --> 21:55.367
Although science
has gotten Jessie

21:55.400 --> 21:56.734
this far,

21:56.767 --> 21:59.100
I need nature to take her
all the way home.

21:59.133 --> 22:00.767
We don't have
much of a shape yet,

22:01.000 --> 22:03.533
but this is the smart
first step.

22:03.567 --> 22:04.567
Let's close.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.133
The big scary thing right now,

22:07.166 --> 22:09.400
and I will know
in the next few days,

22:09.433 --> 22:12.000
is will
the lower pole skin

22:12.033 --> 22:13.333
on the right breast heal.

22:13.367 --> 22:14.467
Of all the cases I've done

22:14.500 --> 22:15.667
in the last five years,

22:15.700 --> 22:18.166
I think this has
the greatest chance

22:18.200 --> 22:19.500
of not working.

22:25.033 --> 22:26.133
In the final song,

22:26.166 --> 22:27.734
I would like you
to come to the front,

22:27.767 --> 22:28.767
and then you can be

22:29.000 --> 22:31.133
breathing out
towards the crowd.

22:38.166 --> 22:40.700
Hello.
How are you? My God...

22:40.734 --> 22:43.033
I've known Tess since I was,
like, 16 years old,

22:43.066 --> 22:44.600
and I want her to come
with me to my consultation

22:44.633 --> 22:47.100
because she's really
into plastic surgery, too.

22:47.133 --> 22:48.734
So yes. [squealing]
I know.

22:48.767 --> 22:50.333
Show me your butt again.
I can't stop looking at it.

22:50.367 --> 22:52.000
Do you like it?
It's good, isn't it?

22:52.033 --> 22:53.166
I'm getting one.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.667
Now I just want
to be made taller.

22:54.700 --> 22:56.000
I've heard that you
can get, like,

22:56.033 --> 22:57.066
some mad, like, implants.

22:57.100 --> 22:58.467
It's like a foot stiletto.

22:58.500 --> 22:59.467
How tall do you want to be?

22:59.500 --> 23:00.700
I think about 5'7".

23:00.734 --> 23:02.000
I think it's
absolutely bonkers

23:02.033 --> 23:03.133
that she wants heel implants.

23:03.166 --> 23:04.567
It's creepy as hell.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.100
At the moment,
because of Instagram,

23:06.133 --> 23:07.567
there's so much pressure
on the way we look.

23:08.767 --> 23:10.600
I know. Face Tune's
really helped me,

23:10.633 --> 23:12.500
but in real life I want
to look the same.

23:12.533 --> 23:14.567
Yeah, but a lot of it
is not very realistic.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.066
Do you want to look
like a cartoon character?

23:16.100 --> 23:17.700
Oh, I do.
Oh, you do?

23:17.734 --> 23:19.367
Do you not want
to look like one?

23:19.400 --> 23:21.166
Not particularly.
Well, you do.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.467

for perfection,

23:24.500 --> 23:26.200
and the only way you can
get really perfection,

23:26.233 --> 23:28.400
unless you're, like,
some lucky gene pool person,

23:28.433 --> 23:30.000
is through plastic surgery.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.734
I need to go speak with
Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow.

23:31.767 --> 23:33.567
I think I need to speak
to both of them

23:33.600 --> 23:34.734
about two different
reasons--

23:34.767 --> 23:36.400
nose
and being made taller.

23:36.433 --> 23:37.667
It'll be perfect.

23:37.700 --> 23:40.033
I can talk about
my surgery...

23:42.533 --> 23:44.133
It's not a big deal anyway.
It's just gonna be, like,

23:44.166 --> 23:46.533
a little bit--
slightly awkward.

23:46.567 --> 23:49.600
I know Dr. Nassif
because we dated briefly.

23:49.633 --> 23:51.133
Obviously, it's like

23:51.166 --> 23:52.433
a little bit
of a funny scenario,

23:52.467 --> 23:54.667
but, oh, well.
It's funny, I think.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.767
Thank you for coming.

23:58.633 --> 23:59.734

Here's the problem.

23:59.767 --> 24:01.467

Good morning.
[Nassif]
Good morning.

24:24.700 --> 24:26.533
How are you?
I'm good.
How are you doing?

24:26.567 --> 24:27.700
Good.

24:27.734 --> 24:30.000
So the surgery is
doing a few things.

24:30.033 --> 24:31.567
Remember, reverse
that kind of piggy look?

24:31.600 --> 24:33.600
But, from the front,

24:33.633 --> 24:36.000
you have a lot of very,
very, very thick skin,

24:36.033 --> 24:38.667
which is gonna make it
wider in certain areas.

24:38.700 --> 24:41.266
Wider, not smaller.

24:41.300 --> 24:43.133
When someone has thick skin,

24:43.166 --> 24:45.000
no matter what type
of a job I do,

24:45.033 --> 24:48.033
they'll always have
a wider, thicker nose

24:48.066 --> 24:49.600
than someone with thin skin.

24:49.633 --> 24:52.000
It's not because of
the underlying structures.

24:52.033 --> 24:54.166
It's because of the skin.

24:54.200 --> 24:56.066
No surprises, God willing.
Okay.

24:56.100 --> 24:57.734
I'll see you later on.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.066
Bye.
Bye.

25:00.100 --> 25:02.700
You know, my biggest concern
today with Mariela's surgery

25:02.734 --> 25:06.600
is how do we get
her airway better

25:06.633 --> 25:08.567
without making
her nose too big.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.266
That is my challenge today.

25:15.100 --> 25:16.333
For Mariela's surgery today,

25:16.367 --> 25:18.000
my team and I will begin

25:18.033 --> 25:19.300
by harvesting rib
from her chest,

25:19.333 --> 25:21.166
composite grafts
from her left ear,

25:21.200 --> 25:23.033
and fascia from her scalp.

25:23.066 --> 25:25.567
I will then open up her nose,
straighten her septum,

25:25.600 --> 25:27.700
and perform introvenal
plastic for better air flow

25:27.734 --> 25:30.266
before adding the diced
cartilage fascia graft

25:30.300 --> 25:31.700
to build up her bridge.

25:31.734 --> 25:33.266
Finally, I'll lower her tip

25:33.300 --> 25:35.400
and open up the nostrils
with composite grafts,

25:35.433 --> 25:37.734
giving Mariela a nose
she can be proud of.

25:37.767 --> 25:40.734
Okay, so I'm making
my incision

25:40.767 --> 25:43.100
for harvesting
the composite graft,

25:43.133 --> 25:47.266
which is a piece of skin
and cartilage.

25:47.300 --> 25:48.367
I'll put it in.

25:48.400 --> 25:49.700
There we go.
Thank you.

25:49.734 --> 25:51.433
We have a really big
rib coming out.

25:51.467 --> 25:52.734
[chuckles]

25:52.767 --> 25:54.100
Do you want to help
prepare it?

25:54.133 --> 25:55.734
You can start the fascia.

25:55.767 --> 25:57.133
Like a well-oiled machine,

25:57.166 --> 25:59.133
my team and I harvested

25:59.166 --> 26:02.100
rib, fascia,
and composite grafts--

26:02.133 --> 26:04.000
all to build up
Mariela's nose.

26:04.033 --> 26:05.100
And, let me add,

26:05.133 --> 26:06.767
all within one hour.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.700
That is a personal record.

26:08.734 --> 26:10.333
I'm opening up the nose now,

26:10.367 --> 26:13.333
creating
my little rim pockets,

26:13.367 --> 26:14.734
and this will help us prepare

26:14.767 --> 26:16.333
to put all the grafts
in the nose.

26:16.367 --> 26:18.200
Now you're gonna trim
that edge a little bit

26:18.233 --> 26:20.000
and make it
softer and rounder.

26:20.033 --> 26:22.100
I already saw it.
As soon as you cut it,
I already knew

26:22.133 --> 26:24.700
because my eye is still
better than yours.

26:24.734 --> 26:26.400
I've been practicing
nasal surgery

26:26.433 --> 26:27.700
for over 20 years.

26:27.734 --> 26:29.133
and a good eye

26:29.166 --> 26:30.633
is when you get
with experience,

26:30.667 --> 26:32.700
especially during
these impossible phases.

26:32.734 --> 26:35.266
Okay, our DCF is going in,

26:35.300 --> 26:39.033
and that should really help
take care of the scoop.

26:39.066 --> 26:42.266
Our finding is that
the composite graft

26:42.300 --> 26:43.734
does not have to go
on the left side.

26:43.767 --> 26:45.100
It has to go
on the right side.

26:45.133 --> 26:48.166
The doctor overdid
the rear incision

26:48.200 --> 26:50.300
where they're cutting off
nostril on the right side.

26:50.333 --> 26:52.633
That's why we're putting
the composite graft in.

26:52.667 --> 26:54.433
Achieving nasal symmetry
is tough.

26:54.467 --> 26:56.700
Sometimes you need
two composite grafts,

26:56.734 --> 26:59.200
or sometimes
one will do the trick.

26:59.233 --> 27:02.367
especially
in an overretracted nose.

27:02.400 --> 27:05.700
So Mariela, looks like she's
gonna get a fantastic nose.

27:05.734 --> 27:07.400
We were able
to build up her dorsum,

27:07.433 --> 27:09.000
stretch out her nose.

27:09.033 --> 27:12.233
Overall, I think
we did a fantastic job.

27:12.266 --> 27:15.000
I've hopefully given Mariela
a new start on life.

27:15.033 --> 27:16.133
No more teasing,

27:16.166 --> 27:17.400
no more name calling.

27:17.433 --> 27:18.667
All that should stop

27:18.700 --> 27:20.100
as of today

27:20.133 --> 27:23.066
because her nose
is gonna look fantastic.

27:23.100 --> 27:24.467
All right. Thank you, team.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.367

27:36.433 --> 27:38.200
You're hurting on your right
more than your left, right?

27:38.233 --> 27:39.767
Oh, my gosh, yes.
Yeah.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.233
The hairy part
of this operation

27:41.266 --> 27:43.266
was the first part
of the operation

27:43.300 --> 27:45.367
because it's all about
peeling the skin

27:45.400 --> 27:46.533
off the ribcage,

27:46.567 --> 27:49.233
so I made an incision
under the areola,

27:49.266 --> 27:51.233
and then I started
to create a pocket above

27:51.266 --> 27:55.100
and successfully was able
to lift up the skin.

27:55.133 --> 27:56.266
Oh, good.

27:56.300 --> 27:59.400
There was that old scar
and soft tissue

27:59.433 --> 28:00.767
that had healed
down the ribcage.

28:01.000 --> 28:06.166
I lined the inside
of that thin skin with it.

28:06.200 --> 28:10.734
I used nature and science
to thicken it up further.

28:10.767 --> 28:14.066
I took a piece of mesh--
Uh-huh.

28:14.100 --> 28:17.433
...and on the inside
of that I reinforced it.

28:17.467 --> 28:21.266
And then I put a very small
little implant in there,

28:21.300 --> 28:24.233
just to keep--
create a pocket,
keep it out.

28:24.266 --> 28:26.033
So at the end
of the procedure,

28:26.066 --> 28:29.033
it was a question of
is the skin going to survive.

28:29.066 --> 28:30.233
What I'm really looking for

28:30.266 --> 28:32.200
is to see
whether that area

28:32.233 --> 28:35.200
is healing and when
there's any sign

28:35.233 --> 28:38.467
of soft tissue breakdown
or lack of blood supply.

28:38.500 --> 28:41.500
Now here's
the problem area.

28:47.233 --> 28:48.333
Huh.

28:48.367 --> 28:49.367
Huh.

Knowing Jessie's history

28:57.233 --> 28:58.734
of spitting out implants,

28:58.767 --> 29:00.567
and having seen
her thin skin,

29:00.600 --> 29:04.000
I'm thankful
that the new tissue

29:04.033 --> 29:06.367
looks good.
It's a little bit compromised,

29:06.400 --> 29:08.500
but it's vascular.
Good job, Terry.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.033

to worry about.

29:12.066 --> 29:14.300
We don't want
to get an infection.
Yeah.

29:14.333 --> 29:17.500
Lots of stuff can happen
in the next ten days.

29:17.533 --> 29:20.133
I'm nervous that the skin
can still die.

29:20.166 --> 29:22.100
I'm hoping, though,
with the next surgery

29:22.133 --> 29:24.133
that maybe we can
get up to a B,

29:24.166 --> 29:25.567
maybe, like, a little C,

I'd be ecstatic.

31:50.333 --> 31:51.700
Yes.
That's not common.

31:51.734 --> 31:53.700
It's called supercharged
butt enlargement.

31:53.734 --> 31:55.500
How many CCs of fat
was injected?

31:55.533 --> 31:57.633
So I got 600 CC in each bum,

31:57.667 --> 32:00.200
and then I got 300
in each implant.

32:00.233 --> 32:02.033
Yeah, that's--
that's a lot.
Wow.

32:02.066 --> 32:03.467
Having a Brazilian
butt lift

32:03.500 --> 32:05.000
with fat transfer

32:05.033 --> 32:07.200
and buttock implants
at the same time

32:07.233 --> 32:08.467
is not a good idea

32:08.500 --> 32:10.033
because, when you
create the pockets

32:10.066 --> 32:12.000
for the buttock implants,

32:12.033 --> 32:13.600
you reduce the overall
blood supply

32:13.633 --> 32:14.767
to the soft tissue,

32:15.000 --> 32:17.300
and the chance
the fat will take

32:17.333 --> 32:19.300
and be transplanted
successfully

32:19.333 --> 32:20.533
is very low.

32:20.567 --> 32:21.700
Are you happy
with everything?

32:21.734 --> 32:23.467
I'm happy as I can
be for this year.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.200
What's on the docket
for next year?

32:25.233 --> 32:26.600
I want, like, a Pikachu nose,

32:26.633 --> 32:28.233
you know, like a--
like a Pokémon.

32:28.266 --> 32:29.400
We've seen people

32:29.433 --> 32:30.667
that want to look
like celebrities,

32:30.700 --> 32:32.734
aliens,
and animated characters,

32:32.767 --> 32:34.734
but never an electric rat.

32:34.767 --> 32:36.200
This is a first.

32:36.233 --> 32:37.533
You came to see me
about your nose.

32:37.567 --> 32:39.333
Yes.
Nothing else, right?

32:39.367 --> 32:41.333
So I want to see you
about something.

32:41.367 --> 32:42.734
Really?
So I've heard

32:42.767 --> 32:44.533
they make you taller.

32:44.567 --> 32:46.266
I would like to have,
like, little implants

32:46.300 --> 32:48.233
in my heels,
if possible.

32:48.266 --> 32:50.567
You mean the Ilizarov
Procedure.
Heard about heel implants

32:50.600 --> 32:52.533
from, like, some sort of,
like, documentary thing,

32:52.567 --> 32:54.533
and I was like, "Oh, my God,
I need to get this,"

32:54.567 --> 32:56.033
but my friend Tess
seems to think

32:56.066 --> 32:57.533
that they're from North Korea
or South Korea.

32:57.567 --> 32:59.000
I don't know
which Korea it is.

32:59.033 --> 33:00.433
One of them
you haven't got internet,

33:00.467 --> 33:01.633
but the other one's
a normal place,

33:01.667 --> 33:03.266
so if they can do it
in Korea,

33:03.300 --> 33:04.333
they can do it in L.A.

33:04.367 --> 33:05.400
How tall are you?

33:05.433 --> 33:07.400
I'm 5'4"--
Yeah?

33:07.433 --> 33:08.633
And I'd like to be
about 5'7".

33:08.667 --> 33:10.300
You're not short
by any means.

33:10.333 --> 33:11.533
I know, but I just think
it would be nicer

33:11.567 --> 33:13.433
to be about 5'7", and then--

33:13.467 --> 33:15.333
You'd still wear heels.
I'd still wear heels.

33:15.367 --> 33:17.500
So let's go do an exam.
Yeah, perfect.

33:17.533 --> 33:20.000
If heel implants
were a thing,

33:20.033 --> 33:22.500
you think Tiny next to me
would be so short?

33:22.533 --> 33:25.567
Let's just address
the heel implant thing
very quickly, okay?

33:25.600 --> 33:28.300
Heel implants are,
by far and away,

33:28.333 --> 33:29.667
the worst possible thing
you could possibly do.

33:29.700 --> 33:31.700
I'll tell you why.
Number 1--

33:31.734 --> 33:33.433
it's the furthest place
away from the heart,

33:33.467 --> 33:35.066
so it's the most trouble
healing,

33:35.100 --> 33:38.500
and 2, it bears the brunt
of your entire body weight.

33:38.533 --> 33:39.567
Okay.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.500
I'm not allowed
heel implants,

33:41.533 --> 33:43.367
but I'm kind of like, mm,

33:43.400 --> 33:45.467
it does sound
a little bit scary,

33:45.500 --> 33:47.333
and I don't want to get
gangrene on my feet

33:47.367 --> 33:49.033
and have to get them
chopped off.

33:49.066 --> 33:50.533
Okay, this is a bright light.

33:50.567 --> 33:53.066
So you're not
even a year yet.

33:53.100 --> 33:54.433
No.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.300
This middle vault
has collapsed.

33:56.333 --> 33:58.000
That little bump.
Let go.

33:58.033 --> 34:00.567
All right, let's see.
Put your head back
for me, please.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.367
What is that, a hole?
What is it?

34:02.400 --> 34:04.033
You got a hole in there.

34:04.066 --> 34:05.667
[gasps]
Oh, my, God, don't.
I'm very scared.

34:05.700 --> 34:08.600
A septal perforation
is a hole

34:08.633 --> 34:10.066
in the partition
that divides

34:10.100 --> 34:12.133
the left nostril
from the right nostril.

34:12.166 --> 34:14.000
If the septal perforation
is very large,

34:14.033 --> 34:15.734
you just pretty much
leave it alone.

34:15.767 --> 34:18.300
In your situation,
you've had three surgeries.

34:18.333 --> 34:20.500
Yeah.
So the chance of you

34:20.533 --> 34:22.000
getting that
from your surgeries

34:22.033 --> 34:24.133
is about 99.9%.
Okay.

34:24.166 --> 34:27.467
2, when you talk about
making your nose very small--

34:27.500 --> 34:28.567
Yeah.
Okay?

34:28.600 --> 34:30.000
And like
a cartoon character,

34:30.033 --> 34:32.400
watch this.
Breathe now in and out.

34:33.600 --> 34:34.700
Now breathe in and out.

34:34.734 --> 34:36.033
You want to breathe
like that?

34:36.066 --> 34:37.300
No.
Yeah, right?

34:37.333 --> 34:38.500
No way.
Right?

34:38.533 --> 34:40.033
Okay, so that's
what will happen

34:40.066 --> 34:42.633
if we take
all the cartilage
away of your tip.

34:42.667 --> 34:43.767
You're gonna pinch here.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.467
And by the way,
you're one year.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.066
Two years,
you'll see more pinching.

34:47.100 --> 34:49.467
If anything, you need
a reconstruction.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.467
So at this point,
it would be a huge mistake

34:51.500 --> 34:53.133
if you want to look
like a cartoon character.

34:53.166 --> 34:55.033
Even though my nose
doesn't look exactly

34:55.066 --> 34:56.667
like the way I want it,
at least it functions,

34:56.700 --> 34:58.600
and at least I'm not
having any problems,

34:58.633 --> 35:00.166
so I think I'm
just best leaving it.

35:00.200 --> 35:01.734
A pleasure.
Aw, thank you so much.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.166
Thank you.

35:07.100 --> 35:08.433
[Nassif]
Hello.

35:08.467 --> 35:09.567
Hello. How are you?

35:09.600 --> 35:10.734
Uh-oh.
She's got that look.

35:10.767 --> 35:12.333
She's go the look.

35:12.367 --> 35:13.600
It's been tough
'cause, uh,

35:13.633 --> 35:15.734
I can only take
Tylenol for the pain.

35:15.767 --> 35:19.667
Why?
Any other medication
will make me nauseous,

35:19.700 --> 35:21.066
and I'm afraid
to throw up

35:21.100 --> 35:22.500
and it will come
through my nose.

35:22.533 --> 35:23.700
And we don't want
that to happen.

35:23.734 --> 35:26.000
The pain is so intense.

35:26.033 --> 35:29.166
One minute the rip hurts
on the scalp of the ear.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.734
It's a lot of different
pains at the same time.

35:31.767 --> 35:34.166
All right, so overall,

35:34.200 --> 35:36.000
you know, I was really
happy with your nose.

35:36.033 --> 35:37.667
Now remember,
the biggest thing

35:37.700 --> 35:40.467
is gonna be we have
to see how your skin
is gonna react.

35:40.500 --> 35:41.767
She does have thick,
thick, thick skin.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.433
Right.
It's gonna take

35:43.467 --> 35:44.734
over three years

35:44.767 --> 35:46.133
before we actually see

35:46.166 --> 35:47.667
her nasal tip

35:47.700 --> 35:49.633
fully looking great.

35:49.667 --> 35:51.400
Head back for me.
That's the way.

35:51.433 --> 35:53.533
Here's the composite
graft right here.

35:53.567 --> 35:55.500
And your skin tone
looks great.

35:55.533 --> 35:57.767
Mariela's in a lot of pain,
but I think

35:58.000 --> 36:00.767
Paul really nailed it.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.133
There's a long way to go,
but if she heals

36:03.166 --> 36:05.133
the way I think
she's gonna heal,

36:05.166 --> 36:07.600
I think she'll finally be
comfortable in her own skin

36:07.633 --> 36:09.400
and can put all that
bullying behind her.

36:09.433 --> 36:11.166
I hope you feel better.
Give it a day or two.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.767

36:18.767 --> 36:23.166

is starting to show.

would go this way.

was going okay.

36:44.100 --> 36:48.066

But I was in touch with,

37:41.600 --> 37:43.200
you know,
Dr. Dubrow's office,

37:43.233 --> 37:46.333
and he wants to put
symmetric implants in.

37:46.367 --> 37:48.033
It gave me hope.

37:48.066 --> 37:49.667
You've been through
some things, haven't you?

37:49.700 --> 37:51.700
I have. As you know,

37:51.734 --> 37:54.233
the right implant
had to be removed.

37:54.266 --> 37:56.200
Right.
Jessie lives in Indiana,

37:56.233 --> 37:58.233
so I had a local surgeon
remove her implant.

37:58.266 --> 38:01.734
We both knew there was
a 60% chance of failure,

38:01.767 --> 38:03.033
but enough time

38:03.066 --> 38:04.166
has passed now

38:04.200 --> 38:05.700
that I think
it's relatively safe

38:05.734 --> 38:08.300
to go ahead and try
a second procedure.

38:08.333 --> 38:11.734
The situation now is very
different, actually.

38:11.767 --> 38:15.066
As it turns out,
that neoskin,

38:15.100 --> 38:18.700
that extremely thin layer,
is now gone.

38:18.734 --> 38:20.700
So the fast
that it got infected

38:20.734 --> 38:23.700
sort of induced it
to form more scar tissue,

38:23.734 --> 38:25.600
and it's sort of movable.

38:25.633 --> 38:28.200
Now that Jessie has had
significant time to heal,

38:28.233 --> 38:32.066
her right breast actually
has much more scar tissue

38:32.100 --> 38:36.333
reinforcing it, so I think
it's a relatively safe time

38:36.367 --> 38:38.734
to go back in
and try it again.

38:38.767 --> 38:41.033
In fact, I think
it's kind of ideal.

38:41.066 --> 38:44.200
My hope today is that I can
just put an implant in there

38:44.233 --> 38:47.433
and get you symmetry
and reasonable shape.

38:47.467 --> 38:50.266
My [bleep] doesn't fail.
Okay?
[laughs]

38:50.300 --> 38:51.600
So let's bring it,
all right?

38:51.633 --> 38:53.000
All right.
Boom.

38:56.333 --> 38:58.066
Gonna take this implant.

38:58.100 --> 39:03.700
And like it.
And you're gonna like it.

39:03.734 --> 39:06.367
Okay, so that area
that got infected

39:06.400 --> 39:09.367
is now probably
the thickest part
of the tissue,

39:09.400 --> 39:11.066
so that's good.

39:11.100 --> 39:13.300
All right, why don't we
put the implant in?

39:14.333 --> 39:15.433
Okay, can you sit her up?

39:15.467 --> 39:16.767
Mm-hmm.

39:18.467 --> 39:23.066
So it's really tight
in this lower pole right here.

39:23.100 --> 39:24.433
My goal is to give Jessie

39:24.467 --> 39:26.433
the best mound symmetry
possible.

39:26.467 --> 39:29.200
While the upper pole
has expanded nicely,

39:29.233 --> 39:31.000
the lower pole
has constricted,

39:31.033 --> 39:33.367
so I need to release that
as much as possible

39:33.400 --> 39:34.700
to give it a better shape.

39:34.734 --> 39:37.300
Okay. Right there.

39:38.400 --> 39:41.033
We're releasing.
Releasing.

39:41.066 --> 39:42.166
That should work.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.700

can't expose now.

I can go out
and not be thinking

40:06.533 --> 40:08.233
that people are
looking at my nose

40:08.266 --> 40:10.100
but they're actually
just looking at me.

40:10.133 --> 40:12.133
This is a new beginning,
and I'm very excited.

40:12.166 --> 40:13.400
It's been forever
since, you know,

40:13.433 --> 40:15.233
Mariela has
invited us out.

40:15.266 --> 40:16.533
I'm very happy for my niece

Look at you.

Before my surgery,

40:38.233 --> 40:39.300
I had absolutely no bridge,

40:39.333 --> 40:40.400
and it made me look

40:40.433 --> 40:41.700
like I had a piggy nose.

40:41.734 --> 40:43.033
I was bullied because of it,

40:43.066 --> 40:44.166
and it made me insecure.

40:44.200 --> 40:45.367
But now,
thanks to Dr. Nassif,

40:45.400 --> 40:46.433
my tip is lower,

40:46.467 --> 40:48.266
and I have more of a bridge,

40:48.300 --> 40:49.333
and I feel more comfortable
in my own skin.

40:49.367 --> 40:50.767
This entire journey
has taught me

40:51.000 --> 40:52.433
that there are
good people out there,

40:52.467 --> 40:54.266
and, while there are bullies,

40:54.300 --> 40:55.467
there are also angels.

40:55.500 --> 40:58.467
I see you different,
shining and happier.

40:58.500 --> 41:00.066
This is another Mariela.

41:00.100 --> 41:02.133
Thank you, okay?
Love you.

41:02.166 --> 41:04.166
I couldn't think
of a better person

41:04.200 --> 41:06.166
to have gone through this
with than my aunt Lilian.

41:06.200 --> 41:07.767
She took care of me

41:08.000 --> 41:09.333
like a mother would.

41:09.367 --> 41:11.333
You go through life,
and you try to forget

41:11.367 --> 41:13.767
that you had
an unrequested nose job.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.100
But just the bullying.
It wasn't okay as a child,

41:16.133 --> 41:17.734
and it is definitely
not okay as an adult.

41:17.767 --> 41:19.300
I've learned that
it doesn't matter

41:19.333 --> 41:20.433

It matters what you think

41:23.100 --> 41:24.333
you'll
ever go back to Lima

41:24.367 --> 41:26.433
for a second round?
No!

41:26.467 --> 41:28.767
No. I think
I learned my lesson.

Going back from when

41:38.000 --> 41:39.567
I first got the implants in

41:39.600 --> 41:41.367
for all the wrong reasons,

41:41.400 --> 41:44.033
and then, till like now,
like, it's been

41:44.066 --> 41:46.233
an emotional roller coaster.
I can't imagine

41:46.266 --> 41:47.600
how my body even,
like, made it through

41:47.633 --> 41:49.233
to finally be done with it.

41:49.266 --> 41:50.500
It's a big relief.

41:50.533 --> 41:52.467
Can you remember
the last time

41:52.500 --> 41:54.100
Jess wanted to go
to the beach with us?

41:54.133 --> 41:55.367
I don't think I've seen
Jess in a bikini

41:55.400 --> 41:56.500
since she was,
like, your age.

41:56.533 --> 41:58.433
Really?
Oh, yeah.

41:58.467 --> 42:00.233
Seeing Jessie
in a bathing suit

42:00.266 --> 42:03.100
just means that she's
getting on with her life.

42:03.133 --> 42:04.266
We've passed that hurdle.

42:04.300 --> 42:05.333
We're moving on.

42:05.367 --> 42:06.500
Now she'll just stay,

42:06.533 --> 42:08.100
like, buck naked
all the time.

42:08.133 --> 42:09.200
We'll be,
like, telling her,

42:09.233 --> 42:10.367
"Jess,
put your clothes on."

42:10.400 --> 42:12.200
She ended up
with five kids.

42:12.233 --> 42:13.533
[laughing]

42:13.567 --> 42:15.166
[Jessie] I didn't think
that I would ever

42:15.200 --> 42:16.533
be wearing a bikini
ever again.

42:16.567 --> 42:19.066
Dr. Dubrow
didn't give up on me,

42:19.100 --> 42:20.600
and, for the first time
in a long time,

42:20.633 --> 42:23.200
I feel free.
Look at you in a bikini.

42:23.233 --> 42:24.266
Hi, guys.

42:24.300 --> 42:27.166
Oh, my gosh, you look so good.

42:27.200 --> 42:30.266
Before my surgeries,
I had one D cup breast

42:30.300 --> 42:32.400
and one negative A
cup breast.

42:32.433 --> 42:35.033
I was afraid that I
would never be normal,

42:35.066 --> 42:37.600
but now I have
two symmetric breasts

42:37.633 --> 42:40.300
that I look good
in and out of clothes.

42:40.333 --> 42:43.533
Now I can look down,
and I have cleavage.

42:43.567 --> 42:45.100
This is pretty sweet.

42:45.133 --> 42:46.533
Dr. Dubrow did wonderful.

42:46.567 --> 42:49.200
I felt like he'd
come in to my life
at the right time.

42:49.233 --> 42:51.100
There's no price
that you can put on this.

42:51.133 --> 42:54.133
Nothing explains, like,
what they've done.

42:54.166 --> 42:56.333
I was in the best hands
that anybody could ask for.

42:56.367 --> 42:58.400
So what's your plan
for your gauze?

42:58.433 --> 42:59.500
I don't know yet.

42:59.533 --> 43:01.133
Do, like, a Viking ceremony.

43:01.166 --> 43:03.633
Like, put it on a-- a boat
and set it on fire.

43:05.300 --> 43:08.033
My doctor tucked me up
with anesthesiologists.

43:08.066 --> 43:09.533
It was like,
"I have other patients.

43:09.567 --> 43:11.400
We're just gonna have to
give you your epidural."

43:11.433 --> 43:12.633
He says, "I'll have
to give you an epidural,

43:12.667 --> 43:14.166
and then I'm gonna
leave you"?

43:14.200 --> 43:16.400
That is a recipe
for disaster.

43:16.433 --> 43:19.066
I nearly died
from my plastic surgery.

43:19.100 --> 43:21.066
No more plastic surgery?
I can't promise that.

43:21.100 --> 43:23.667
If my kids were saying this,
I'd be pissed.

43:23.700 --> 43:25.200
My face started changing.

43:25.233 --> 43:26.300
I lost fat

43:26.333 --> 43:27.400
all around my face.

43:27.433 --> 43:28.633
She went from
looking like me

43:28.667 --> 43:30.567
to looking like
unrecognizable.
