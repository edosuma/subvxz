<i>You will be asked
a number of questions</i>

08:59.280 --> 09:01.918
By the solicitor who
is in the court room upstairs.

09:02.433 --> 09:05.616
After each question,
you must answer into the camera.

09:06.390 --> 09:07.804
It that all clear?

09:13.558 --> 09:15.790
Can you give him
a message? - Who?

Ray.

09:17.429 --> 09:19.127
Can you give it a
message from me

09:19.696 --> 09:21.823
That is completely
out of the question.

09:38.575 --> 09:39.999
Ray?

09:42.049 --> 09:45.551
Where did you go?
Why did you leave me?

09:48.308 --> 09:50.875
Ray, can you hear me?

12:59.779 --> 13:02.975
Are you spying on us?
You are lost?

13:04.800 --> 13:07.098
I'm looking for Ray.
Do you know him?

13:07.988 --> 13:09.459
No. How does he look like?

13:10.873 --> 13:13.271
What about me?
Young and good-looking

13:16.575 --> 13:19.261
- This man.
- Yeah, this is Pete.

13:21.695 --> 13:24.478
- Pete?
- Yes, he's my boss.

13:24.785 --> 13:27.162
It should be right

14:36.989 --> 14:38.698
Okay, in here.

14:46.617 --> 14:48.248
Can you close the door?

14:48.830 --> 14:51.472
- I do not want the door closed.
- Close the door!

15:08.475 --> 15:10.621
How did you find me?

15:23.552 --> 15:25.558
- How did you get here?
- I drove from where I live.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.791
Where I still live.

15:30.391 --> 15:32.534
- What do you want?
- To see you.

15:44.784 --> 15:47.879
I can fucking believe you
drive here because of a photo.

15:49.594 --> 15:51.621
What if we just
go outside, okay?

15:53.069 --> 15:55.318
You can say what you
wanna say outside.

16:05.903 --> 16:08.411
- What?
- Are you allergic to me?

16:08.833 --> 16:10.924
- Okay, fuck this.
- Don't go.

16:10.986 --> 16:15.389
Fuck this. Stay away of me,
Stay away, you need help.

16:16.033 --> 16:17.773
Ray... Ray!

16:24.788 --> 16:28.485
I do not know if you are
you, if you are her.

16:29.130 --> 16:31.850
- I am, of course I am.
- No, you are not.

16:32.183 --> 16:34.856
- Yes you did.
- I did not even recognize you...

16:34.925 --> 16:37.627
- Your face went white
- You could be anyone

16:42.318 --> 16:45.877
You could be a journalist.
Your hair is different... a reporter.

16:46.590 --> 16:47.989
You could be anyone.

16:48.135 --> 16:50.915
How many other thirteen
year old have you had sex with?

16:54.321 --> 16:55.461
none

17:01.223 --> 17:05.973
Do you want to see my
birth mark you kissed it

17:08.029 --> 17:11.486
What about what you promised on the
beach. A life together just you and me?

17:13.397 --> 17:16.969
- None.
- Are you sure?

17:47.347 --> 17:48.569
- Hi.
- Hello.

17:48.903 --> 17:50.234
Where are you headed?

17:52.317 --> 17:56.594
We are going to Europe, just me and dad.
We are going to catch the ferry.

Yes. Dover to Calais.
Then who knows?

18:01.148 --> 18:04.919
- Have a good time.
- Thanks.

18:30.297 --> 18:31.559
none

18:34.520 --> 18:37.082
just me
in that room.

19:13.584 --> 19:15.432
Your smiling,
you have forgotten.

19:17.127 --> 19:18.248
Yes.

19:23.596 --> 19:27.788
Yes, I had.
What did you expect?

19:30.269 --> 19:33.660
it should been six months later
you'd been on the sex offenders register

19:33.685 --> 19:35.926
Ray would be on it.
you would not be allowed to forget,

19:35.965 --> 19:37.187
you would not have a new life.

19:37.212 --> 19:39.376
- I served my time.
- 4 years for what you did to me.

19:39.453 --> 19:41.201
My dad could not believe it.

19:41.520 --> 19:44.278
He was never again was the same.
He died a few years after.

19:44.370 --> 19:46.516
- How?
- He fell.

19:47.335 --> 19:48.701
tripped down some steps

19:50.263 --> 19:51.886
He thought of
you were his friend.

19:53.088 --> 19:54.272
He tried to find you.

19:54.381 --> 19:56.484
He know where I
was for the first 4 years.

19:56.598 --> 19:59.376
He wanted to hunt
you down and kill you.

20:01.507 --> 20:04.503
Hey, give me that!

20:06.916 --> 20:08.667
Jesus

20:10.661 --> 20:12.735
You thought that
I come to kill you

20:30.129 --> 20:33.102
I borrowed this from your
dad. Can you give it back to him?

20:49.266 --> 20:51.834
You changed your
name. Is that difficult?

20:53.793 --> 20:56.420
It was random.
Picked it out of a phone

20:57.777 --> 20:59.375
Peter...

21:00.478 --> 21:01.284
Peter what?

21:04.006 --> 21:05.254
I can ask outside.

21:10.459 --> 21:11.622
Travelian.

21:13.331 --> 21:18.486
Travelian... Peter Travelian.
Where did you get it?

21:19.173 --> 21:23.214
By the "T". - Peter Travelian.
Are you fucking serious

21:23.759 --> 21:27.028
Does that command respect?

21:28.184 --> 21:29.583
okay.

21:29.877 --> 21:32.275
What about the photos
you took of me in your house?

21:32.429 --> 21:33.722
I got rid of them,
I burned them all.

21:33.753 --> 21:35.617
I've seen those websites,
those poor kids.

21:35.647 --> 21:36.138
Never.

21:36.163 --> 21:38.441
10, 11, 12
on beds, sofas...

21:38.466 --> 21:41.063
They are sick bastards.
I was never one of them.

21:43.353 --> 21:45.421
Is everything okay, Pete?

21:46.246 --> 21:50.630
Yeah its all good man
Peter and I just talking.

21:50.676 --> 21:52.674
I leave it to it

21:59.302 --> 22:01.882
I was never one of them,
you know I was not

22:01.907 --> 22:02.487
Do I?

22:02.512 --> 22:05.808
Everyone called me that.
The prisoners, the guards...

22:05.809 --> 22:09.842
They spat on me, beaten up. I had
human shit putting my face, you know not.

22:09.961 --> 22:12.568
I don't know anything about
you except. - You abused me

22:16.288 --> 22:17.138
Didn't you?

22:18.955 --> 22:20.713
- Didn't you?
- Yes, but...

22:20.738 --> 22:22.337
There is no but.

22:22.827 --> 22:24.813
I was never one of them.

22:26.489 --> 22:29.486
You were my neighbors
daughter, not a target.

22:39.664 --> 22:41.880
You were looking at me.

22:52.257 --> 22:55.317
<i>I always just wonder, if
I had not argued with my friend.</i>

22:55.342 --> 22:58.446
It could have been her you chose. Could
have all happened to her and not to me.

23:02.919 --> 23:07.265
You know what you did, then
I'm not going to tell you, okay?

23:23.108 --> 23:26.405
- Where is Lea.
- She went home.

23:30.947 --> 23:32.546
<i>Una...</i>

23:32.607 --> 23:34.402
I did not choose you.

23:35.797 --> 23:38.974
It is a beautiful day.
The smoke would not kill me?

23:41.589 --> 23:44.165
Should we call
a fire brigade

23:45.479 --> 23:48.975
- You'll be bored out your mind here.
- I ve got bore protection.

23:49.629 --> 23:53.925
I want one.
Give me one, go on.

23:56.255 --> 23:58.233
You're get me in trouble.

24:00.003 --> 24:03.300
How many people were there
barbecue? 10 or 15 people, right?

24:03.438 --> 24:04.137
Why?

24:04.315 --> 24:08.473
Because I had
shorts on that day. I Had...

24:09.046 --> 24:10.744
Yes, they laughed
about this at court.

24:11.080 --> 24:14.277
That you were in shorts? That
was it your defense at court?

24:14.278 --> 24:17.627
If I've been aroused...
if I've had an erection,

24:17.674 --> 24:20.258
- If I had been turned on...
- Can you hear yourself?

24:20.283 --> 24:24.249
I stood there next to you,
drinking my beer in shorts.

24:24.303 --> 24:26.788
I will have walked away,
I would have sat down.

24:28.267 --> 24:31.662
<i>A person knows if
they are aroused by children,</i>

24:32.508 --> 24:36.410
<i>Because they always look
to be near them,</i>

24:36.669 --> 24:42.453
To lure them, deceive them. The
greater the risk, the bigger the thrill.

24:43.059 --> 24:46.191
- You seem to know a lot about it.
- I talked to psychologists.

24:46.216 --> 24:48.780
There are patterns of behavior.
Cycles... cycles of abuse.

24:48.805 --> 24:52.207
- Were you abused as a child?
- For Gods sake! not.

24:52.568 --> 24:55.540
That is the exactly same
thing that the lawyer asked me.

24:55.565 --> 24:58.819
He claimed the court would be
more lenient if I had been abused.

24:58.950 --> 25:01.747
But I haven't
I'm not one of them.

25:03.160 --> 25:05.138
Mark is waiting for you.

25:06.332 --> 25:08.609
I have a meeting
I have to go.

25:08.702 --> 25:09.801
Go away.

25:09.951 --> 25:11.050
Why don't you wait in the car?

25:11.151 --> 25:13.549
- Peter!
- Okay!

26:31.016 --> 26:33.514
You know this is
A great deal - yeah

26:35.024 --> 26:37.711
So listen, just don't
fuck it up

26:37.742 --> 26:41.049
We want you moving ahead
into the future with us, yea?

26:44.365 --> 26:47.751
Okay?
Peter, you are okay?

26:49.985 --> 26:53.083
Good, let's go in.

26:58.806 --> 27:00.392
What are you doing here?

27:04.490 --> 27:06.788
You're a good swimmer.

27:08.565 --> 27:10.785
you want a race?

27:12.305 --> 27:13.327
You bet.

27:52.709 --> 27:55.905
- Who was that guy?
- Yes, who was he?

27:56.541 --> 27:58.486
Just someone I know.

27:58.511 --> 28:01.508
- What do you mean?
- around.

28:02.537 --> 28:04.345
- Tell us!
- Tell us!

28:04.645 --> 28:08.179
He is the neighbor,
a friend of my dads

28:12.664 --> 28:14.162
Let's go

29:10.379 --> 29:13.345
- A cup of tea?
- No thanks.

29:13.376 --> 29:15.844
- Coffee?
- Do not.

29:18.684 --> 29:21.750
We got champagne,
ice cream, caviar

29:40.572 --> 29:41.818
Thank you.

29:46.414 --> 29:49.411
Listen, why don't we
go for that meeting

29:50.511 --> 29:54.007
Go at least to the reception.
You should not be here alone.

29:54.008 --> 29:56.339
I am waiting for Peter.

30:18.383 --> 30:21.979
State your full name
To the court, please.

30:25.995 --> 30:27.973
Ray...

30:29.773 --> 30:32.070
Where did you go?

30:32.371 --> 30:35.667
What happened? By
what did you leave me?

30:38.865 --> 30:41.663
Ray, can you hear me?

30:45.859 --> 30:47.657
I love you.

30:53.117 --> 30:57.047
That does mean we need to
consolidate several positions.

30:59.571 --> 31:01.944
Here at ETHGON
We believe in investing in

31:01.945 --> 31:04.641
Only in ideas, but in people.

31:44.526 --> 31:48.422
I'll pass you over to
Peter and I thank you.

31:59.490 --> 32:02.583
Right okay so
its just like Jen said

32:02.663 --> 32:05.281
<i>We're gonna be moving</i>

32:05.282 --> 32:07.979
To work more
with northwest.

32:08.090 --> 32:14.474
And... consolidating our futures
together, usually a new beginning.

32:27.580 --> 32:29.458
I cant do this.

32:30.780 --> 32:35.907
They want me...
to give me six names.

32:35.939 --> 32:38.575
They want six
names to tell - Darryl...

32:38.600 --> 32:40.792
Excuse me.
I am doing this.

32:40.793 --> 32:43.083
Darryl. Darryl,
bye. I am sorry.

32:43.108 --> 32:45.688
<i>And Frank Stokes.
I'm sorry, mate.</i>

32:57.178 --> 32:58.376
Peter!

33:00.135 --> 33:03.871
I'll fucking kill him. Peter!

33:08.468 --> 33:10.076
<i>Peter.</i>

33:30.297 --> 33:32.455
Peter!

33:42.145 --> 33:44.143
Scott...

33:46.081 --> 33:49.138
What the fuck
is wrong with Peter?

33:50.438 --> 33:52.136
Nothing.

33:54.209 --> 33:56.846
Hey do you think
he is your friend?

33:58.871 --> 34:01.168
You are on his list.

34:01.944 --> 34:03.542
Yeah

34:05.067 --> 34:07.664
You should empty
out your locker.

34:28.143 --> 34:30.041
Get up.

34:30.955 --> 34:33.752
How long
you've been married?

34:33.949 --> 34:36.848
I don't have time
for this. Let's go.

34:38.623 --> 34:40.333
Four years.

34:40.731 --> 34:42.963
Do you have children?

34:45.678 --> 34:47.427
No

34:48.511 --> 34:50.920
Poor woman no idea
who she's married to...

34:50.945 --> 34:52.822
She knows.

34:53.822 --> 34:55.621
She knows?

34:57.652 --> 34:59.318
I have to go.

35:02.826 --> 35:04.614
How did she know?

35:08.011 --> 35:10.584
- How did she know?
- Because I told her.

35:10.609 --> 35:11.912
And she was fine with it?

35:11.943 --> 35:14.341
Of course not, but I told her
what my life was like then

35:14.380 --> 35:15.180
What was your life like then?

35:15.205 --> 35:18.701
I had problems. - Did You?
Did you really? What kind of problems?

35:18.765 --> 35:22.534
I did the biggest and most
stupid mistake of my entire life.

35:22.672 --> 35:25.769
Did you tell her it was a
three months stupid mistake?

35:25.770 --> 35:28.466
- And that you ran away with me?
- I told her everything, because

35:28.467 --> 35:29.866
Because she loves me

35:29.867 --> 35:31.965
What's wrong with her? There
must be something wrong with her

35:31.966 --> 35:34.064
Why not? What the
fuck is wrong with her?

35:36.286 --> 35:37.649
Pete!

35:39.960 --> 35:43.563
This is my life.
I had to fight for this.

35:43.588 --> 35:45.585
I lost everything.

35:46.135 --> 35:50.331
Did you ever think about me?
What was happening to me?

35:50.386 --> 35:53.028
You were left
off after four years.

35:53.029 --> 35:55.027
I have been living
this for 15 years.

35:55.028 --> 35:58.026
Every fucking day! We never
We moved from that house!

35:58.027 --> 36:00.712
I was talked about,
pointed out stared at!

36:00.789 --> 36:03.921
I was attacked
by your girlfriend!

36:05.135 --> 36:07.917
I lost my life.

36:08.518 --> 36:10.906
The only thing I did
not lose was my name.

36:11.607 --> 36:13.804
I had to keep my name.

36:15.903 --> 36:17.702
<i>Peter!</i>

36:19.001 --> 36:20.699
<i>Peter?</i>

36:21.812 --> 36:23.897
Pete!

36:52.513 --> 36:54.965
She attacked you?

36:55.885 --> 37:00.160
A couple of years later, I was shopping
with my mother and she slapped me.

37:00.461 --> 37:02.160
pushed me to the ground.

37:07.803 --> 37:11.550
She said silent you glared it up

37:14.857 --> 37:17.544
that you were after me.

37:21.668 --> 37:26.998
You used to hang around in
the street near the car.

37:27.225 --> 37:30.733
<i>You wrote a note - put
it on the windshield wiper.</i>

37:33.432 --> 37:37.427
Your girlfriend is ugly.
Your Girlfriend got a glasseye."

37:43.531 --> 37:47.417
I'm ashamed of that stupid
girl and the stupid crush.

37:48.431 --> 37:50.528
- You were not stupid.
- I was.

37:50.813 --> 37:52.614
No, you were not.

37:56.229 --> 37:59.008
You do not remember
what you were like.

38:00.185 --> 38:01.905
What was I like?

38:04.804 --> 38:06.402
Very strong.

38:08.353 --> 38:10.199
Determined

38:12.426 --> 38:14.276
Wise beyond your years.

38:14.286 --> 38:16.574
- No
- Yes

38:17.234 --> 38:18.572
Yes.

38:19.653 --> 38:21.571
You were so impatient.

38:21.692 --> 38:23.592
Sick of been
treated like a child.

38:25.440 --> 38:27.766
That's what children say

38:32.011 --> 38:35.177
What could I have possibly
given you that was not my body?

38:35.965 --> 38:38.457
What else could you have
wanted? There is nothing else.

38:38.923 --> 38:40.455
There was

38:41.539 --> 38:43.526
For me there was.

39:01.875 --> 39:03.733
Do you remember the codes?

39:05.254 --> 39:08.828
I used to ring your
parents' house - one ring

39:10.756 --> 39:13.824
That meant that she gone
out and you are on your own.

39:14.524 --> 39:17.621
Car parked facing right
Meat me in the park.

39:26.950 --> 39:28.711
I could not stop

39:30.399 --> 39:33.506
- I should have stopped.
- But you did not.

39:51.398 --> 39:54.784
<i>Whatever was
Whatever I was thinking,</i>

39:58.301 --> 39:59.972
<i>made me believe...</i>

40:04.212 --> 40:05.974
That I loved you.

40:42.536 --> 40:44.934
Crawling into
these trees.

40:51.829 --> 40:54.924
Empouring up my top
and touching my breasts

40:57.368 --> 41:00.764
and unzipping your trousers
and taking your prick.

41:03.008 --> 41:05.785
telling me to hold it

41:08.315 --> 41:09.828
<i>And on the blanket you brought...</i>

41:11.679 --> 41:13.588
<i>I thought it was to make
us comfortable, but then</i>

41:13.589 --> 41:15.916
<i>I realized afterwards
it wasn't, was it?</i>

41:17.052 --> 41:21.012
<i>It was so that twigs and
earth would not stick to my clothes.</i>

41:21.013 --> 41:23.681
<i>so no one would suspect.</i>

41:37.577 --> 41:39.664
I did not want us to get caught.

41:39.839 --> 41:44.461
every waking moment was about
How I could get closer to you,

41:45.022 --> 41:48.457
How to talk to you I
was obsessed with you.

41:49.343 --> 41:51.989
I still leave work early,
I come home...

41:52.255 --> 41:55.352
I work on my car,
my car didn't need work

41:55.697 --> 41:58.350
I do it just that
I could be near you.

42:08.151 --> 42:09.259
You remember.

42:17.916 --> 42:19.649
We both knew the risks.

42:41.496 --> 42:43.127
One of you seen Peter?

44:10.061 --> 44:11.413
Una

44:18.325 --> 44:21.184
- There were twin beds.
- Don't

44:23.347 --> 44:24.533
Why not?

44:24.595 --> 44:27.180
We both know what happened.
We were both there.

44:31.698 --> 44:33.055
We undressed.

44:34.733 --> 44:38.669
We had sex on one of the beds.
I'm not sure how long for.

44:40.209 --> 44:44.172
I saw how much pleasure I gave you.
I liked that I could do that.

44:46.453 --> 44:50.762
We did it twice.
fucked... twice.

44:50.792 --> 44:52.766
You turned me around
in the second time

44:54.600 --> 44:57.154
We made so much noise.

45:01.790 --> 45:04.576
We lay in each other arms
afterward, then I cried a bit.

45:06.097 --> 45:09.842
My parents were looking for me.
They were phoning my friends.

45:11.186 --> 45:14.128
I do not even know if
I came. Did I come?

45:14.722 --> 45:17.127
I thought you did

45:23.166 --> 45:25.939
How could you tell? Did I
make a noise? What did I do?

45:31.350 --> 45:34.878
You - your eyes were closed,
your face was flushed.

45:53.848 --> 45:57.686
You said you wanted cigarettes.
You're going to look for a shop.

45:58.984 --> 46:02.582
I wanted to go with you but
you said, "No, I was to wait there".

46:04.009 --> 46:06.579
You touched me and you
kissed me between my legs.

46:10.494 --> 46:12.573
You will be back
in five minutes.

46:15.144 --> 46:18.868
<i>I fell asleep, when I woke up
I did not know what time it was.</i>

46:21.014 --> 46:24.862
<i>I was sober to my legs,
but I felt wonderful. I was...</i>

46:26.086 --> 46:28.460
I was so happy.

46:30.105 --> 46:32.772
You'll be back soon and
You have chocolates for me.

46:33.860 --> 46:36.167
I did not even have to
tell you I wanted

46:36.192 --> 46:39.478
You know what I wanted
and you bring it to me.

46:49.414 --> 46:52.636
<i>I waited for you in that room,
But you never came back.</i>

47:07.822 --> 47:09.453
What are you doing?

47:12.170 --> 47:15.658
This room is private.
What are you wanting?

47:24.946 --> 47:27.354
<i>I looked for you in the town.
I looked everywhere.</i>

47:27.925 --> 47:29.057
<i>I could not find you.</i>

47:29.257 --> 47:30.687
Did a man come having cigarettes?

47:30.712 --> 47:32.147
- What?
- About an hour ago.

47:32.172 --> 47:34.019
A man - cigarettes?
- Sorry my love.

47:53.222 --> 47:56.187
- Hey you cant be in here, my love.
- I'm looking for my dad.

47:56.212 --> 47:58.693
- Whats his name?
- Ray.

47:58.731 --> 48:01.554
This girlie looking for
her dad - Ray.

48:01.798 --> 48:03.241
Is there a Ray in the bar?

48:04.746 --> 48:06.963
When did you last
see him, honey?

48:37.022 --> 48:38.535
OMG.

49:10.470 --> 49:14.216
<i>I felt sick, I wanted to die.
I was never going to see you again.</i>

49:16.971 --> 49:19.875
Ray! Ray!

49:24.624 --> 49:26.177
Ray!

49:26.670 --> 49:29.068
<i>I did not say anything to
anyone, I did not say a word.</i>

49:29.137 --> 49:32.434
I told them that you had not
touched me - that I ran away.

49:57.827 --> 49:59.979
They asked me what you have
done to me and when I would not say,

50:00.004 --> 50:02.624
They told me
what have you done to me

50:04.132 --> 50:08.619
They drugged me and held me down and
opened my legs and took out your cum.

50:11.855 --> 50:13.615
They say that you
you only after one thing

50:13.640 --> 50:17.335
And that when you got what
you want, that's why you disappeared.

50:29.101 --> 50:32.297
I hate the life I had.

50:35.691 --> 50:38.691
You would not know any of
that, but I wanted you to know.

50:55.328 --> 50:56.231
<i>Peter?</i>

51:14.262 --> 51:15.754
Peter?

51:16.556 --> 51:19.751
- Can you go out of it, please?
- I am sorry.

51:48.809 --> 51:50.559
I came back.

51:51.525 --> 51:53.656
- What?
- I did not let you.

51:55.482 --> 51:56.654
I came back.

51:57.441 --> 51:59.552
- A chocolate.
- Thank you.

51:59.753 --> 52:03.249
- 25. Thank you very much.
- Thank you. - Lovely

52:03.250 --> 52:06.205
- Thank you.
- Have a good one.

52:06.252 --> 52:07.347
Bye.

52:07.414 --> 52:10.513
I needed a drink,
I needed courage, because...

52:12.625 --> 52:14.941
We really doing it

52:15.794 --> 52:18.238
We would getting on a
ferry, we are running away

52:24.465 --> 52:26.530
Same again, mate

52:36.400 --> 52:40.365
I just needed
clear my head.

52:40.467 --> 52:43.285
So I went for a walk
around the streets

52:43.286 --> 52:46.513
and then, then I came back

53:05.532 --> 53:07.492
She told me you were gone.

53:08.911 --> 53:10.889
Just run off

53:11.939 --> 53:16.484
I went to the car, yelled at help for you
dark as I thought maybe you were hiding.

53:17.057 --> 53:19.695
But nothing and I mean...

53:19.720 --> 53:23.179
I thought in panic where
would you go? Why would you go?

53:23.480 --> 53:26.774
I did not know what the fuck was going on?
It did not make any fucking sense.

53:27.054 --> 53:30.573
<i>Then I thought maybe someone
has got you. That you were being hurt</i>

53:30.574 --> 53:32.872
That I had not protected you.

53:36.697 --> 53:38.866
Can I get a whiskey man - a double?

53:39.804 --> 53:41.865
You got a daughter?

53:44.159 --> 53:46.061
Yeah.

53:46.742 --> 53:49.287
- Why? Have you seen it?
- Have you lost her?

53:56.299 --> 53:58.050
Yes.

54:00.049 --> 54:01.989
What are you
doing here for then?

54:02.867 --> 54:06.563
- Did she say where she was going?
- What's your name?

54:06.564 --> 54:09.561
- What's your name, mate?
- Come here! Hey!

54:18.055 --> 54:19.351
No, I did not leave you.
That's what the lawyer said

54:19.376 --> 54:22.532
that's what the lawyer said because
he said it might sound better in court

54:22.557 --> 54:26.644
That I was disgusted
with myself and so I ran away.

54:28.734 --> 54:32.829
It is not true. I did not.
I came back for you.

54:34.850 --> 54:38.596
<i>I would like to
report a missing person.</i>

54:41.445 --> 54:43.854
Pardon me?
A missing person

54:55.508 --> 54:58.981
Leaving me there and
coming back there is no difference.

54:59.071 --> 55:00.549
Yes there is

55:01.950 --> 55:03.718
For me there is.

55:07.249 --> 55:08.792
Pete!

55:09.517 --> 55:10.735
Peter!

55:22.727 --> 55:27.212
What's going on - The lights
- they are locking up for the day.

56:46.666 --> 56:49.659
- We can not stay here.
- Are they expected home?

56:52.400 --> 56:55.096
Yeah. I am.

56:59.821 --> 57:01.551
Did you tell your wife...

57:02.893 --> 57:07.489
...that you were coming back for me,
You would not have left me there?

57:11.390 --> 57:13.478
No

57:14.275 --> 57:17.572
You have not told her,
have you? - Anything?

57:18.818 --> 57:20.073
How could I?

57:21.434 --> 57:24.631
- Don't you think she should be told?
- I do not wish to talk about it.

57:25.962 --> 57:27.659
- Can I meet her?
- Do not be stupid.

57:27.660 --> 57:28.959
How old is she?

57:28.960 --> 57:31.852
- She's a year older than me.
- Is she sexy? Does she turn you on?

57:32.310 --> 57:34.372
That sagging skin?
What does she like best?

57:34.434 --> 57:37.228
You are not like that.
You need help!

57:37.253 --> 57:38.920
- You are sick!
- No! I'm not!

57:38.945 --> 57:41.089
- You're fucking sick.
- No, I'm not

57:41.875 --> 57:43.872
I'm not sick!

58:07.043 --> 58:09.810
I started at 6:30 this morning

58:19.661 --> 58:21.844
Have you got a job?
You have work?

58:22.387 --> 58:25.037
Just an office job,
Nothing shattering.

58:25.440 --> 58:28.036
It's not what I wanted to do.

58:35.067 --> 58:37.445
What do you want to do?

58:39.217 --> 58:42.015
I do not know, something else.

58:46.747 --> 58:49.984
Do you still live
with your mother? No?

58:50.438 --> 58:52.425
If she knew I was here...

58:58.213 --> 59:00.402
Do you have a boyfriend?

59:02.518 --> 59:03.971
No

59:45.759 --> 59:50.064
I did think to about you,
growing up what you being like.

59:50.649 --> 59:52.853
I never wanted to hurt you.

01:00:00.936 --> 01:00:03.533
Did you think about me then?

01:00:08.603 --> 01:00:11.629
So I have of you
hugging you

01:00:12.739 --> 01:00:14.327
Touching you.

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:20.970
And fucking me?

01:00:30.225 --> 01:00:32.623
Do you masturbate?

01:00:38.923 --> 01:00:40.227
Do you come?

01:00:45.157 --> 01:00:46.455
Yeah

01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:20.228
- I cannot.
- I want you doing it.

01:03:21.325 --> 01:03:23.042
No

01:03:24.035 --> 01:03:27.132
- Why not?
- I cant be with you.

01:03:30.628 --> 01:03:32.414
Am I too old?

01:04:50.711 --> 01:04:52.467
Pete?

01:04:53.405 --> 01:04:54.803
- Oh
- What the fuck, man?

01:04:55.476 --> 01:04:57.256
- What?
- What the fuck?

01:04:58.375 --> 01:05:00.237
What the fuck -
You gave them my name

01:05:00.452 --> 01:05:03.139
- You got me fired?
- Hold on. Who told you that?

01:05:03.493 --> 01:05:05.428
- Fucking Mark!
- He is lying.

01:05:05.911 --> 01:05:07.208
- He is lying.
- He told me.

01:05:08.319 --> 01:05:13.951
Look, look. Your name
is not on that. That's the list.

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:16.707
Mark's a liar.

01:05:18.033 --> 01:05:21.230
Please just get it her
Get her out of here - lock up.

01:05:21.789 --> 01:05:24.283
Please. Can you do that?
Just get her out of here.

01:05:59.365 --> 01:06:01.503
Look, you got to go.
You cant stay here.

01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:04.197
Where is he?

01:06:11.892 --> 01:06:15.289
- Ray!
- He's gone, he just left.

01:06:16.751 --> 01:06:19.186
Ray! - He's gone,
I've just seen him!

01:06:25.837 --> 01:06:28.434
You got to go,
I need to lock up.

01:06:37.663 --> 01:06:40.720
Do you want to go for
a drink? I really do need one.

01:06:41.363 --> 01:06:45.069
- I do not know.
- Just one drink. Come on.

01:06:46.517 --> 01:06:47.494
Just one.

01:06:49.441 --> 01:06:50.812
Is that your?

01:07:16.155 --> 01:07:19.832
There it is, do you see it?
That's our new life.

01:07:19.866 --> 01:07:21.265
Yes.

01:07:42.854 --> 01:07:44.932
Listen, why do you call him Ray?

01:07:46.172 --> 01:07:47.969
It is a long story.

01:07:48.351 --> 01:07:50.157
Was there something
going on between you two?

01:07:53.604 --> 01:07:56.241
You got anything
to drink at your place?

01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:42.229
Hey.

01:08:44.528 --> 01:08:46.078
Peter?

01:09:12.468 --> 01:09:14.465
A long day?

01:09:16.112 --> 01:09:19.198
Almost all - the dirty stuff

01:09:20.617 --> 01:09:23.368
Thanks you for doing
all that downstairs.

01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:33.580
- Coming here. Why wouldn't you?
- Gonna get ready.

01:09:33.621 --> 01:09:35.518
Come on.

01:10:14.141 --> 01:10:17.937
- It's not full.
- Oh shit. Sorry.

01:10:22.833 --> 01:10:24.431
Very good.

01:10:24.432 --> 01:10:26.520
How is it going?
It's good?

01:10:51.014 --> 01:10:53.092
You have a little...

01:11:10.655 --> 01:11:12.942
You're good? Una?

01:11:31.565 --> 01:11:32.895
It's okay

01:11:39.370 --> 01:11:42.236
- I am so sorry.
- It's okay.

01:11:44.159 --> 01:11:46.158
Do not be silly, hey.

01:11:53.616 --> 01:11:55.305
It's okay

01:11:57.248 --> 01:12:01.624
I wanna go home. Would you
take me? I don't think I can drive

01:12:01.734 --> 01:12:05.110
Yeah of course.
Where is home?

01:12:09.037 --> 01:12:11.615
Peters.
I am staying at Peter's.

01:12:16.766 --> 01:12:19.183
Do you staying at Peter?

01:12:20.562 --> 01:12:22.211
He's my Dad.

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:30.376
Are you serious?

01:12:32.853 --> 01:12:35.849
I need to go home.
He's inspecting me.

01:12:38.251 --> 01:12:39.264
It's okay

01:12:40.444 --> 01:12:43.817
There is a party tonight.

01:12:46.472 --> 01:12:47.773
I forgot.

01:12:57.592 --> 01:12:59.770
You're okay?

01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:05.821
I have not eaten anything.

01:13:06.769 --> 01:13:08.666
- I mix something.
- I'm fine, it's okay.

01:13:08.691 --> 01:13:12.288
OK, I will find to eat something
for you, and then I'll get you home.

01:13:14.314 --> 01:13:15.461
Yeah?

01:13:48.537 --> 01:13:50.135
Una, where are you?

01:13:50.308 --> 01:13:51.930
I'm fine.

01:13:52.367 --> 01:13:54.765
I was about to
to call the police.

01:13:58.017 --> 01:14:00.015
You have no idea at all.

01:14:00.834 --> 01:14:01.917
<i>About what?</i>

01:14:03.230 --> 01:14:05.420
<i>You were so desperate
hushed all up.</i>

01:14:10.728 --> 01:14:12.327
Una

01:14:20.212 --> 01:14:23.010
<i>Please come back.
Let me know where you are.</i>

01:14:29.513 --> 01:14:31.511
<i>Please, darling.</i>

01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:12.706
Una

01:15:20.541 --> 01:15:26.335
Wow. It was my girlfriend's.
Two weeks ago.

01:15:27.312 --> 01:15:29.372
You look amazing

01:15:33.009 --> 01:15:35.327
Are you coming with me?

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:38.744

- Please, come with me.

01:16:39.561 --> 01:16:41.259

01:16:48.864 --> 01:16:54.858
- It's Sterling and Hetti.
- They are precious.

01:16:56.486 --> 01:17:00.048
Stop licking
...Come on.

01:17:02.801 --> 01:17:05.798
- What the fuck?
- It's fine.

01:17:06.797 --> 01:17:09.395
Let me get you a drink.
Scott help yourself.

01:17:09.396 --> 01:17:11.192

01:17:17.306 --> 01:17:21.660

01:17:27.247 --> 01:17:28.887
Peter is outside.

01:17:36.562 --> 01:17:40.667
- The garden looks great.
- Thanks, I try to keep...

01:18:04.150 --> 01:18:06.047
This is Una.

01:18:07.277 --> 01:18:09.938
- Hello, Peter.
- Yeah I am good.

01:18:10.832 --> 01:18:14.218
Hye, there is someone I want
you to meet. Excuse me, love.

01:18:20.239 --> 01:18:23.435
- What the hell is going on?
- What?

01:18:25.614 --> 01:18:28.212
- How did you meet Peter?
- I have two friends.

01:18:28.271 --> 01:18:29.655
Have you been together long?

01:18:29.684 --> 01:18:31.483
- Four years now.
- Happy?

01:18:38.003 --> 01:18:41.001
Sorry, is that the
wrong thing to ask?

01:18:47.295 --> 01:18:50.992
We've just got here.... I'm fucking
serious, just get her out of this house.

01:18:54.198 --> 01:18:56.686
- You're not her dad.
- What did you say?

01:19:05.477 --> 01:19:09.394
- Tonight, there is something special?
- Just a drink with some friends.

01:19:10.194 --> 01:19:12.091
That nice.

01:19:13.275 --> 01:19:16.088
- Hey, let's get out of here.
- I'm sorry, we have to go.

01:19:16.448 --> 01:19:18.550
- But you just got here.
- ...we go on

01:19:18.575 --> 01:19:22.001
- No, I'm talking to Ivonne.
- Sweetheart, we have to go back.

01:19:22.570 --> 01:19:24.668
Love, do not do this,
we have to go.

01:19:25.575 --> 01:19:27.253
No

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:31.079
Can I go to the bathroom.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:19.037
We can be stuck
up here forever.

01:21:31.969 --> 01:21:33.723
I love you.

01:22:07.751 --> 01:22:09.715
What are you
doing in my room?

01:22:17.186 --> 01:22:20.273
- I'm a friend of Peter's.
- From work?

01:22:21.215 --> 01:22:23.003
No

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:27.386
- Do you know my Mum?
- Not really, no.

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.036
Whats your name

01:22:36.489 --> 01:22:37.763
Una

01:22:52.832 --> 01:22:55.789
- What's wrong love?
- Una

01:22:56.086 --> 01:22:57.662
Una, Una.

01:23:01.098 --> 01:23:03.096
Hey.

01:23:18.076 --> 01:23:20.604
Never. I would never do that.

01:23:21.258 --> 01:23:24.034
- Please don't.
- No please, Una.

01:23:24.497 --> 01:23:28.272
I look after her.
I take care about her.

01:23:30.562 --> 01:23:32.939
You mean? God

01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:37.506
I've never desired
anyone that age

01:23:38.574 --> 01:23:40.224
Again.

01:23:43.848 --> 01:23:45.828
I promise.

01:23:57.751 --> 01:24:00.248
You were the only one.
