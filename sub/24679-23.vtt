WEBVTT

00:06.306 --> 00:08.809
In New York City's war on crime,

00:08.876 --> 00:10.856
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:10.911 --> 00:13.755
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:13.914 --> 00:15.723
These are their stories.

00:17.985 --> 00:19.430
I've been warning those people.

00:19.486 --> 00:22.433
For 15 years, we were vulnerable.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.469
Your resume says that you
served with the Army Rangers

00:25.526 --> 00:26.596
in the '80s.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.264
Who was your CO?

00:29.329 --> 00:33.004
Sorry, fellas, can't go
into operational details.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.875
I do have combat experience.

00:36.503 --> 00:38.710
In an advisory capacity.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.283
Suffice it to say,

00:40.340 --> 00:44.117
I'm looking for an opportunity
to get back on the front lines.

00:45.479 --> 00:49.325
Okay. We'll make our decision
in the next couple of weeks.

00:49.816 --> 00:51.318
Thanks for meeting with us, Dan.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.594
Okay. I'll look forward to working with you.

00:55.355 --> 00:57.494
Yeah. Thanks.

01:02.329 --> 01:04.001
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

01:10.270 --> 01:13.342
My bus took forever. You get him in bed okay?

01:13.407 --> 01:15.478
He fell asleep listening to his radio.

01:15.542 --> 01:17.283
I left you some tuna in the fridge.

01:17.344 --> 01:18.948
Thanks, sweetheart.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.491
See you tomorrow.

01:20.547 --> 01:22.083
Not if I can help it.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.863
Dr. Croydon, Victor's looking for you.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.297
He found some papers you were
burning in the oil furnace.

01:28.355 --> 01:30.232
He says that's illegal.

01:30.290 --> 01:32.292
What is he talking about?

01:33.226 --> 01:37.197
You tell him snooping through
my garbage, that's illegal.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.046
- Hey, Matson.
- Hey.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.141
There it is.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.149
Thanks.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:06.760 --> 02:08.535
Morning, Dr. Croydon.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.734
Don't you worry, I'll get Victor that message.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.572
(DOORBELL RINGING)

02:23.877 --> 02:25.754
Let me just rinse up.

02:31.518 --> 02:32.861
I thought you'd be here earlier.

02:32.919 --> 02:34.159
(BANGING)

02:34.221 --> 02:35.461
(THUDDING)

03:31.478 --> 03:32.855
AKHRASS: Her name's Connie Matson.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.051
Part-time home care nurse.

03:34.114 --> 03:36.617
She was Air Force until 3 months ago.

03:36.683 --> 03:38.685
We found her discharge papers.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.663
Page 2, section 5.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.799
"Special Duties: Anthrax Vaccination Program."

03:43.857 --> 03:44.961
That's why I called you in.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.005
You did the right thing.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.334
She was stationed just down
the road at McGuire AFB.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.240
You'd think an Air Force nurse

03:52.299 --> 03:55.212
could do better than night
shift as a home care.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.344
And here's why.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.577
General discharge. 2 medical leaves,

03:59.639 --> 04:02.381
each less than 30 days. Maybe drug rehab.

04:03.610 --> 04:06.557
No. I didn't see any track marks on her arms.

04:07.380 --> 04:10.918
If it's drugs, it's probably
amphetamines. Go pills.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.986
Air Force keeps them around like vitamins.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.897
Maybe her go-go lifestyle got the best of her.

04:30.504 --> 04:34.384
It's gel from an ice pack where
the seal must have been broken.

04:43.216 --> 04:45.127
"For use with food and medical supplies.

04:45.185 --> 04:47.961
"Conforms to US Military specifications."

04:48.855 --> 04:51.028
Right down to the serial numbers.

04:54.060 --> 04:56.165
HENDRICKS: The ice pack was
traced to your dispensary.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.799
You worked in the infirmary together.

04:57.864 --> 05:00.606
It's even known you fraternized with her.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.610
Right, is the Lieutenant right, Airman?

05:05.872 --> 05:07.977
Were you fraternizing with Matson?

05:08.041 --> 05:10.419
Yes, sir. Before I was married.

05:11.011 --> 05:14.185
Well, she didn't have any
contraceptives in her apartment,

05:14.247 --> 05:18.696
no condoms, no evidence at all
that she had a boyfriend.

05:19.252 --> 05:23.325
Not even that she was pursuing
a heterosexual relationship.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.233
You were her beard?

05:28.061 --> 05:31.099
Because a young, unattached
woman, gay or straight,

05:31.164 --> 05:32.973
would be harassed here.

05:35.402 --> 05:36.403
Yes, ma'am.

05:36.469 --> 05:38.949
And lately she was having
a tough time in the world,

05:39.005 --> 05:40.882
and she came to you for help.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.511
Something she could sell?

05:48.815 --> 05:51.489
Boosters for the anthrax vaccine.

05:52.419 --> 05:54.831
She said she had a buyer for them.

05:55.188 --> 05:59.330
Anthrax vaccinations and the yearly
boosters are tightly controlled.

05:59.392 --> 06:02.032
And someone would buy them on the black market

06:02.095 --> 06:04.837
because they'd want to stay off the radar.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.811
And once they're vaccinated, the next step is

06:07.868 --> 06:09.142
getting the anthrax.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.239
Could be a nut job with a roll of stamps

06:11.304 --> 06:13.580
or a terrorist with a crop duster.

06:14.474 --> 06:18.081
I see a lot of inquiries in Matson's
file about her military record.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.055
Hospital, medical group...

06:20.113 --> 06:21.990
Prospective employers.

06:22.616 --> 06:23.856
Yeah. And then there's this one,

06:23.917 --> 06:26.523
Haznostics Incorporated up on Fordham.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.497
They made two inquiries.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.360
"Haznostics."

06:34.060 --> 06:37.303
GOREN: "A testing facility for
environmental hazards and bioagents."

06:37.364 --> 06:40.208
Well, anthrax certainly qualifies.

06:47.774 --> 06:50.414
There was no anthrax in the nurse's apartment.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.388
But the lab found five spores

06:52.445 --> 06:55.153
on the money she gave to her Air Force buddy.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.156
Same South African strain

06:57.217 --> 06:59.823
as the anthrax in Dr. Stern's collection.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.866
Dr. Stern who says he doesn't know anything

07:01.922 --> 07:03.401
about missing anthrax.

07:03.456 --> 07:05.936
Whoever gave the nurse
the money to buy the vaccine,

07:05.992 --> 07:07.903
already has the anthrax.

07:10.463 --> 07:11.874
Haznostics.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.809
EAMES: What position did she apply for?

07:13.867 --> 07:15.278
Nurse in our clinic.

07:15.335 --> 07:18.612
She has experience treating
exposure to bioagents.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.083
Does that happen here often?

07:20.140 --> 07:21.141
No.

07:21.207 --> 07:25.178
We do environmental testing for
insurance claims, workers' comp.

07:25.378 --> 07:26.516
But you never know.

07:26.579 --> 07:29.924
Has any of your employees ever
been vaccinated for anthrax?

07:29.983 --> 07:32.725
Anthrax isn't something we've dealt with,

07:33.186 --> 07:35.188
but I think Dr. Croydon...

07:41.494 --> 07:44.236
Dr. Dan Croydon, our lab director.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.406
He was vaccinated a few years ago

07:46.466 --> 07:48.343
during a posting in South Africa

07:48.401 --> 07:49.903
for the WHO.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.877
Has he kept up with his boosters?

07:51.938 --> 07:53.918
His last one was 4 years ago.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.976
He'd no longer be protected
against the virus,

07:56.042 --> 07:58.750
unless he got boosters we didn't know about.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.656
I see he worked at the Army bioweapons lab

08:01.715 --> 08:03.353
at Fort Detrick in the early '90s.

08:03.416 --> 08:04.986
I like this guy.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.730
What's this notation for?

08:06.786 --> 08:08.527
His wages are being garnished.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.499
He fell behind in his child support.

08:10.623 --> 08:12.796
I really like this guy now.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.172
Is he here today?

08:15.228 --> 08:17.401
He took his son to Jones Beach.

08:20.900 --> 08:24.211
Every morning, 7:00, Dr. Croydon's out
the door, comes back an hour later.

08:24.270 --> 08:25.874
You ever seen him with this woman?

08:25.939 --> 08:29.250
No. Dr. Croydon's hit a dry
spell lately, you know?

08:29.642 --> 08:33.111
You call him a doctor, but he's not a
doctor. He's a scientist. A lab rat.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.486
But he makes you call him "Doctor"?

08:34.547 --> 08:35.991
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.791
I know his type. Goes off on people...

08:38.852 --> 08:41.991
That's him. He even threatened
to have the super arrested.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.125
For what?

08:43.188 --> 08:45.362
Super caught him burning
garbage in the furnace.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.735
We need to check the furnace room.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.306
EAMES: Directory of government agencies.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.540
He's highlighted a few,
FBI, Homeland Security.

08:56.603 --> 08:58.082
Could be targets.

08:58.405 --> 09:02.410
Found one picture of his son.
Looks at least 5 years old.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.546
He's an equal-opportunity deadbeat.

09:04.611 --> 09:07.285
His wife filled out this
healthcare form 2 months ago.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.452
He hasn't mailed it in yet.

09:09.516 --> 09:12.053
It's "the Great Flu Epidemic."

09:13.019 --> 09:17.263
The flu epidemic of 1918 killed
22 million people worldwide.

09:17.957 --> 09:19.834
Excuse me, who are you?

09:19.893 --> 09:21.930
And what the hell is going on here?

09:21.995 --> 09:23.668
We just executed a search warrant.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.368
A search? A search for what?

09:25.432 --> 09:27.469
Evidence of a crime.

09:28.368 --> 09:31.645
- Do you know a Connie Matson? She's a nurse.
- No.

09:31.704 --> 09:34.514
EAMES: She applied for a job at your lab.

09:34.674 --> 09:37.553
I don't hire the nurses, and you
haven't answered my question.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.180
What are you searching for?

09:39.245 --> 09:42.021
Well, this, for one. You
highlighted some of these agencies.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.789
Any particular reason why?

09:43.850 --> 09:45.659
They offered me work.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.122
You people have no idea
who you're dealing with,

09:49.189 --> 09:51.169
but you'll find out. I promise you.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.101
Oh, speaking of unfulfilled promises,

09:53.159 --> 09:55.105
make sure you mail this.

09:59.466 --> 10:01.104
It doesn't sound good, Dan.

10:01.167 --> 10:04.307
Maybe we should take them up on their
invitation and go and talk to them.

10:04.370 --> 10:07.078
I know these people. It
doesn't matter what you say,

10:07.140 --> 10:08.642
they twist it around

10:08.708 --> 10:10.710
until it suits the conclusion they want.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.587
I refuse to play their game. I won't do it.

10:15.148 --> 10:19.062
The lab says there was no trace of
anthrax at all in his apartment.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.065
Might just mean he's not
as careless as we thought.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.759
This is the lab report from the furnace.

10:22.822 --> 10:25.666
They found ashes of paper products

10:26.326 --> 10:28.932
and traces of bentonite.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.601
I give up. What's bentonite?

10:31.664 --> 10:33.940
An anthrax dispersal agent.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.276
It keeps it from sticking to surfaces,

10:36.336 --> 10:39.579
like the inside of an envelope, for example.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.982
And then there's this

10:41.040 --> 10:44.021
they found in a corner of the furnace box.

10:44.077 --> 10:48.150
It's the plastic package
used for self-adhesive stamps.

10:48.681 --> 10:50.820
Postage stamps and bentonite.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.488
And a hit list.

10:53.853 --> 10:55.662
Next stop is a mailbox.

11:00.693 --> 11:02.229
We notified the Feds.

11:02.295 --> 11:05.003
The HAZMAT people are checking mailboxes

11:05.231 --> 11:06.869
near Croydon's home and his job

11:06.933 --> 11:08.674
and along the route he takes to work.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.442
If Dr. Croydon has anthrax,

11:10.503 --> 11:12.505
can we say with certainty how he got it?

11:12.572 --> 11:15.883
The anthrax on the money was from a
strain developed by the South Africans.

11:15.942 --> 11:19.082
Croydon was in South Africa in the late 1990s,

11:19.145 --> 11:20.920
same time as Roger Stern.

11:20.980 --> 11:23.483
Sounds as sure as next week's weather.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.860
"The idea that American
companies export anthrax

11:25.919 --> 11:28.695
"to such despotic regimes as Iraq

11:28.755 --> 11:31.827
"with the approval of our
government is insane.

11:31.891 --> 11:33.427
"But that's what's happening now.

11:33.493 --> 11:37.566
"And one day these bioagents will reap
terror, and we will be unprepared."

11:37.630 --> 11:41.476
It's a letter to the editor he wrote in 1988

11:41.534 --> 11:43.480
when he worked for the Defense Department.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.278
Must have made him popular
with his colleagues.

11:46.339 --> 11:49.877
Well, he got reprimanded. His career stalled.

11:50.109 --> 11:53.488
Now he has an ax to grind, a point to prove.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.554
We were posted in South Africa for 3 years.

11:58.618 --> 12:01.155
Dan's work was water quality.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.360
No anthrax, far as I know.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.629
Far as you know.

12:05.191 --> 12:07.034
Was there a lot you didn't know?

12:07.193 --> 12:10.606
Let's just say that Dan was a
disappointment and leave it at that.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.304
You mean personally or professionally?

12:14.367 --> 12:18.907
Because he had a prestigious job with the WHO,

12:18.972 --> 12:22.351
a PhD from the Strathcona University.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.549
Was there something wrong with his PhD?

12:25.612 --> 12:27.592
He never finished his thesis.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.888
His problem is he never
finished anything in his life.

12:29.949 --> 12:31.986
He'd rather quit or run away.

12:32.085 --> 12:35.123
I know the type. You know,
he neglects his child support,

12:35.188 --> 12:37.327
irresponsible, self-involved.

12:37.390 --> 12:41.736
You know, he just needs a personal crisis

12:43.396 --> 12:45.342
to carry out his threats.

12:46.366 --> 12:49.108
Anything like that going
on in his life right now?

12:49.936 --> 12:52.348
My son said

12:52.405 --> 12:55.011
that his job interviews
haven't been going very well.

12:55.074 --> 12:56.314
GOREN: Just one more thing.

12:57.043 --> 12:59.421
I noticed a diagnostic code

13:00.213 --> 13:02.989
on your husband's medical claim

13:03.883 --> 13:05.453
for post-cancer treatment.

13:05.518 --> 13:08.021
I was diagnosed with breast
cancer 6 years ago.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.725
When you were in South Africa.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.565
I came home for treatment with my son.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.671
But not with Dan.

13:15.094 --> 13:17.540
He was having too much fun
jetting around the world,

13:17.597 --> 13:19.270
doing important work.

13:20.767 --> 13:24.214
When I finished chemotherapy,
I filed for divorce.

13:25.571 --> 13:27.881
The man that she described
fits the profile.

13:27.940 --> 13:31.513
A wounded idealist who's nursed
his grievances for years.

13:31.577 --> 13:33.955
Which doesn't get us any
closer to an arrest warrant.

13:34.013 --> 13:36.254
We turn up the pressure.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.193
We drive him into our arms.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.130
REPORTER 1: Mr. Carver, is it
true you're looking for anthrax?

13:45.191 --> 13:47.831
We're looking for evidence in
the murder of Connie Matson.

13:47.894 --> 13:51.000
REPORTER 2: We've been told an employee
of Haznostics, Dr. Daniel Croydon,

13:51.064 --> 13:52.441
is a suspect.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.842
CARVER: Dr. Croydon is not a suspect.

13:54.901 --> 13:57.677
While we have no clear evidence
linking him to the murder,

13:57.737 --> 14:00.877
he remains a person of
interest to us. Thank you.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.510
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)

14:10.750 --> 14:14.562
I recognize that we live
under the rule of law,

14:15.388 --> 14:18.426
but I have a right to due process.

14:19.325 --> 14:22.067
They call me a person of interest,

14:22.295 --> 14:25.902
as if that entitles them to ransack my home

14:26.199 --> 14:28.338
and smear me in the press.

14:29.135 --> 14:31.945
All without a shred of evidence.

14:33.172 --> 14:35.743
I've prepared a handout for the press.

14:35.908 --> 14:37.854
It contains a chronology

14:38.411 --> 14:40.448
of the government's campaign against me.

14:41.614 --> 14:45.118
Dr. Croydon, would you be
willing to take a blood test

14:45.184 --> 14:48.131
to prove that you haven't
been exposed to anthrax

14:48.187 --> 14:50.599
or recently vaccinated for anthrax?

14:50.656 --> 14:53.262
Dr. Croydon wants to come in,
but I've advised him not to.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.704
Well, if you're afraid he's
gonna incriminate himself,

14:55.762 --> 14:58.038
then we'll make it off the record.

14:58.097 --> 15:01.078
I have no fear of incriminating myself.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.139
Is that a yes?

15:07.540 --> 15:10.783
There are over 1,200 different
strains of Bacillus anthracis.

15:10.843 --> 15:14.518
And if your so-called experts told you they
could pinpoint where this one came from,

15:14.580 --> 15:15.820
you should fire them.

15:15.882 --> 15:18.226
No, see, they compared it to an anthrax sample

15:18.284 --> 15:21.822
which is known to have come from the
South African biowarfare program.

15:21.888 --> 15:24.494
I'm sorry, I should be discussing
this with other scientists,

15:24.557 --> 15:25.558
not with you.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.002
We're going on two motives.

15:27.059 --> 15:31.098
The first is extortion.
The suspect needs money.

15:31.330 --> 15:34.106
Say, because his wages are being garnished,

15:34.167 --> 15:36.443
or he's stuck in a dead-end job.

15:36.502 --> 15:40.245
Only a mediocre mind would think
that's a plausible motive.

15:40.306 --> 15:42.343
I can't wait to hear your other theory.

15:42.408 --> 15:45.480
Vindication. The suspect feels victimized.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.354
This is how he's settling the score.

15:47.413 --> 15:49.689
That's another mediocre idea,

15:49.749 --> 15:51.422
for someone with his qualifications

15:51.484 --> 15:53.486
would find the proper forum
to air his grievances.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.863
Oh, right, like sending
a letter to the editor.

15:55.922 --> 15:59.131
When you were forced out, why
didn't you raise a real stink?

15:59.192 --> 16:02.401
It was a waste of my energy.
I had a family to take care of.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.408
GOREN: Oh, right. Nothing comes before family.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.465
Right.

16:06.065 --> 16:09.672
Maybe you just didn't feel up
to taking on the government.

16:09.869 --> 16:12.850
You know, that's another
aspect of the profile.

16:12.905 --> 16:16.352
Sometimes they compensate
by pumping up their resumes.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.685
With non-existent PhD’s.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.052
That's a clerical error.

16:21.113 --> 16:23.753
One other aspect of the profile,

16:26.419 --> 16:28.160
passive-aggressive personality.

16:28.254 --> 16:31.360
(SCOFFING)
The kind that kills with anonymous letters.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.425
That's not me.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.800
It's in everything that you do!

16:33.860 --> 16:36.238
You neglect your child support,

16:36.295 --> 16:37.296
your medical claims...

16:37.363 --> 16:38.501
No, I forgot.

16:38.564 --> 16:40.373
You want to be seen as the victim.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.434
No, I told you, I...

16:41.501 --> 16:44.243
Well, you won't. You'll be
seen as the malcontent,

16:44.303 --> 16:46.146
a fake, a loser

16:46.205 --> 16:49.414
who won't even take care of the
basic needs of his family.

16:49.475 --> 16:51.819
Damn it. I told you, I just forgot!

16:51.878 --> 16:55.451
Oh, you forgot to come home with
your wife when she got cancer?

16:55.515 --> 16:57.426
She didn't have to come back to New York.

16:57.483 --> 16:59.429
They have hospitals in South Africa.

16:59.485 --> 17:01.522
She did it to undermine me.

17:08.426 --> 17:11.964
You... you bastard.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.041
You bastard!

17:21.473 --> 17:22.544
Good day.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.726
Dr. Croydon will be a hit with the jury.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.390
He's not ready to give it up yet.

17:35.454 --> 17:37.456
He had a lot of fight left in him.

17:37.523 --> 17:39.969
We stay on him. We wear him down.

17:40.026 --> 17:41.903
He'll break. He'll make a mistake.

Which room?

17:51.571 --> 17:52.914
Thank you.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.309
Son of a bitch.

18:02.648 --> 18:05.094
There's a note on the desk,
but it's not signed.

18:15.061 --> 18:16.665
He's broken now.

18:25.004 --> 18:27.814
The ME's leaning toward a finding of suicide.

18:27.873 --> 18:31.980
She found booze and anti-anxiety
medication in Croydon's blood.

18:33.179 --> 18:34.385
- There was a note?
- Yeah.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.894
"I tried to serve my country.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.259
"But now they've engaged

18:59.572 --> 19:02.678

19:12.451 --> 19:15.295
is directed outward at me.

But depression, suicidal depression,

19:17.590 --> 19:20.434

19:23.829 --> 19:25.866
He succeeded at killing
himself, but he never...

19:25.931 --> 19:29.538
This guy, he never finished
one thing, not even his note.

19:30.136 --> 19:31.376
Well...

19:34.206 --> 19:37.415
The anthrax booster was found,
unused, this morning

19:37.476 --> 19:41.049
by Canadian customs in a knapsack

19:41.113 --> 19:43.150
on a New York-Montreal train.

19:43.215 --> 19:47.095
There was also a small vial with
less than 2 grams of anthrax.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.855
They think the owner

19:50.623 --> 19:54.537
lost his nerve and got off the train
before it reached the border.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.397

was the guy, after all.

Everything pointed to Croydon.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.969
You didn't listen, Bobby.

You didn't listen to what his wife said.

21:45.337 --> 21:49.342
if you don't incinerate bentonite
at a very high temperature,

21:49.775 --> 21:51.049
it leaves a residue.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.521
Now, Croydon...

21:52.578 --> 21:56.924
Croydon's lab has a 2,000-degree
industrial furnace.

21:56.982 --> 22:01.453
So why did he use an oil furnace
that only burns at 400 degrees?

22:01.787 --> 22:02.857
He would have known better.

22:02.922 --> 22:05.266
I had Latent take another look

at Connie Matson's cover letter to Haznostics.

Her fingerprints are under
the ink, not over it.

22:17.436 --> 22:19.677
She only handled the blank page.

22:19.738 --> 22:23.777
Somebody else wrote the letter,
printed it, mailed it.

22:25.411 --> 22:30.121
This evidence, it's manufactured.
Croydon was set up.

mysteriously, he's been cleared.

It doesn't make sense. If
somebody wanted to ruin the guy...

Hello, Bobby.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.167
I would call you Detective Goren,

23:20.232 --> 23:22.974
but given your press coverage lately,

23:23.369 --> 23:25.610
you probably want a low profile.

23:27.006 --> 23:28.349
Keep your hands on deck.

But like many of your theories lately,

23:54.466 --> 23:56.707
wouldn't butter your parsnips.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.417
What will they do with you, Bobby?

nice tunnel for you to guard?

24:26.598 --> 24:29.408
Just like you were wrong about Dr. Croydon.

24:32.371 --> 24:37.218
Read the papers, Detective. Your
insights have no currency anymore.

24:39.878 --> 24:41.949
Is that what this is about?

24:44.917 --> 24:47.124
Do you remember what you said about Moby Dick

24:47.186 --> 24:49.530
and the unrelenting pursuit of evil?

24:50.990 --> 24:55.166
I know why you were unrelenting
about Dr. Croydon.

24:55.661 --> 25:00.269
I know what it was about him that
stuck to your hide like a harpoon.

25:06.505 --> 25:11.045
He ran out on his poor sick wife.

25:15.614 --> 25:18.788
Cheers, Bobby. This was
everything I'd hoped for.

Oh, nice to meet you. Elizabeth tells
me you're one of New York's finest.

Oh, not these days. So you're married to...

25:46.912 --> 25:49.222

25:50.249 --> 25:54.698
We should give you our number, and you
should join us for dinner one night.

25:55.020 --> 25:57.762
Oh, better yet, you should
jot down our license plate.

25:57.823 --> 25:59.860
You can find us that way.

26:04.630 --> 26:05.938
Oh, gosh.

26:06.765 --> 26:09.336
She wouldn't have dangled herself
in front of me like that

26:09.401 --> 26:11.745
unless she felt completely protected.

26:11.804 --> 26:14.580
With Gavin Haynes as her
husband, she would be.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.484
She planned this return from the
minute that she disappeared.

26:17.543 --> 26:20.456
Stern, Buzz Davis, Connie Matson...

26:20.512 --> 26:22.253
Who knows how long that she knew them.

26:24.316 --> 26:25.954
to their numbers till she needed them.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.998
And then there's Croydon.

evidence, and she killed him.

26:41.300 --> 26:45.442
And Ms. Matson, is she also responsible?

26:57.883 --> 27:00.864
Croydon. She picked a man
I already didn't trust,

27:00.919 --> 27:02.830
I already didn't respect.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.800
That's how she blind-sided me. She...

27:11.797 --> 27:14.107
She picked a man like my father.

27:18.370 --> 27:22.182
She... She got me. She got me good.

27:25.277 --> 27:27.279
Then let's get her back.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.460
That's Nicole and her French boyfriend

27:34.520 --> 27:37.330
during their killing spree in Thailand.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.528
Well, outside of being blonde and pretty,

27:39.591 --> 27:42.037
that girl doesn't have a lot
in common with Elizabeth.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.301
You have any more recent photos?

27:44.363 --> 27:45.603
There's that.

27:45.664 --> 27:49.237
I noticed your marriage went unnoticed.

27:49.301 --> 27:52.510
Was that her idea, to keep it a secret?

27:52.704 --> 27:55.116
She told me that she had an ongoing dispute

27:55.174 --> 27:56.448
with the Australian tax people

27:56.508 --> 27:59.114
over a fund she ran in Melbourne.

27:59.178 --> 28:01.715
It's actually not her dispute.

28:01.780 --> 28:05.057
It's Elizabeth Hitchens',
whose identity she stole.

28:06.318 --> 28:09.788
She tell you about her little
stint at Hudson University?

28:09.855 --> 28:14.031
She was very sorry she got
dragged into an academic feud.

28:14.092 --> 28:17.904
A feud? She was responsible
for the murder of 2 people

28:17.963 --> 28:20.705
and killed 2 more in the last 2 weeks.

28:20.766 --> 28:23.212
If you had one iota of evidence...

28:23.268 --> 28:26.215
You don't see it, do you?

28:27.206 --> 28:30.847
We're just picking on your poor innocent wife.

28:31.276 --> 28:33.278
I hear a familiar voice.

28:34.146 --> 28:37.593
Sweetheart, I tried to call you at the spa.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.061
They told me, but I was
wrapped up in something.

28:41.119 --> 28:42.689
GOREN: Don't worry.

28:42.754 --> 28:46.099
You did a good job inoculating
him against the truth.

28:50.028 --> 28:54.238
Sooner or later, she is going to turn on you.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.844
She probably turned on people for good reason.

28:57.903 --> 29:00.474
I don't intend to give her that reason.

29:02.107 --> 29:05.111
But I've humored you, Detective, up till now.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.623
But I know about all your methods.

29:07.679 --> 29:10.319
You drove an innocent man to commit suicide.

29:12.851 --> 29:14.421
I'm warning you,

29:15.721 --> 29:17.826
don't try it with my wife.

29:23.695 --> 29:25.265
A week after her marriage,

29:25.330 --> 29:28.334
Hitchens got an expedited citizenship hearing

29:28.400 --> 29:29.902
before an administrative judge

29:29.968 --> 29:32.471
and pledged allegiance a week later.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.910
Unless we prove beyond a reasonable doubt

29:34.973 --> 29:38.386
that she is, in fact, Nicole
Wallace, she's out of our reach.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.218
ME heard back from the Australians.

29:40.279 --> 29:44.523
Nicole Wallace got vaccinated
for anthrax in 1996,

29:44.583 --> 29:46.119
in Bendigo.

29:46.518 --> 29:50.466
Apparently, that's the
heartland of sheep country.

29:50.522 --> 29:52.092
Do you have an atlas?

29:52.157 --> 29:56.071
Her last booster was over 2 years ago.

29:56.128 --> 29:59.302
ME says it protects up to 2 to 3 years later.

29:59.364 --> 30:03.141
If we could test her blood, we'd know if
she handled the South African anthrax.

30:03.201 --> 30:06.239
There's no probable cause
to compel a blood test.

30:06.305 --> 30:09.252
6 years ago, Croydon investigated

30:09.308 --> 30:11.948
an anthrax outbreak in Australia,

30:13.712 --> 30:15.953
in the state of Victoria,

30:18.150 --> 30:20.596
which happens to be where Bendigo is.

30:20.652 --> 30:24.623
6 years ago, Croydon's wife was
in New York battling breast cancer.

30:24.690 --> 30:26.829
He would've been in Australia by himself.

30:26.892 --> 30:28.530
They could've met.

30:29.094 --> 30:32.234
Nicole could've found out
that he ran out on his wife.

30:32.297 --> 30:35.369
Factor in your credibility
problem, Gavin Haynes.

30:35.434 --> 30:36.845
The way he was mooning over her,

30:36.902 --> 30:40.281
he'd spend his last dime
keeping her out of trouble.

30:40.339 --> 30:44.310
She seemed to be moony over
him, too, in her own way.

30:45.844 --> 30:49.587
Question is, how far will
she go to protect him?

30:52.718 --> 30:56.632
As you can see by the date, the Australians
filed their extradition request

30:56.688 --> 30:59.760
2 months before Ms. Haynes'
citizenship was granted.

30:59.825 --> 31:04.103
She wasn't aware of it. Your office
just didn't perform its due diligence.

31:04.162 --> 31:06.005
You can't revoke her citizenship,

31:06.064 --> 31:09.841
and because this concerns
non-violent financial crimes,

31:09.901 --> 31:11.278
she can't be extradited.

31:11.336 --> 31:14.180
That's true, but this is one of
several irregularities involving

31:14.239 --> 31:17.846
the administrative judge who presided
over her citizenship hearing.

31:17.909 --> 31:21.618
Ms. Haynes, did Judge Burbank ask
you for a financial consideration?

31:21.680 --> 31:22.818
STYMINGTON: Now wait a minute!

31:22.881 --> 31:24.656
The judge paid off the
mortgage on his country home

31:24.716 --> 31:27.629
2 weeks after Ms. Haynes became a citizen.

31:28.053 --> 31:30.363
We're very curious how he did that.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.961
Did we bribe him, is that
what your question is?

31:36.194 --> 31:37.366
No.

31:37.562 --> 31:40.338
If you'll give me a minute,
I'll be right back.

31:44.669 --> 31:46.512
You're sure you don't know about this?

31:46.571 --> 31:48.414
I mean, if Gavin did anything...

31:48.473 --> 31:49.747
I know.

31:49.808 --> 31:51.788
He wouldn't be so bloody reckless.

31:51.843 --> 31:54.346
Well, he just might, Elizabeth. He loves you.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.417
Now, you may not be in
trouble, but he would be.

31:58.517 --> 32:00.997
Bribing a judge is serious business.

32:05.056 --> 32:07.036
Judge Burbank?

32:08.026 --> 32:09.699
Elizabeth Haynes.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.931
You did my citizenship hearing.

32:12.998 --> 32:15.239
Yes, I remember, Mrs. Haynes.

32:15.300 --> 32:17.541
Could I have a word with you in private?

32:23.408 --> 32:24.853
This may come as a shock to you,

32:24.910 --> 32:27.686
but you're being investigated
for taking bribes.

32:27.746 --> 32:30.249
Excuse me? Where did you hear this?

32:30.315 --> 32:34.457
They suspect my husband of helping
you pay off your little shack here.

32:35.020 --> 32:37.193
I have no way of knowing if he did or not,

32:37.255 --> 32:40.065
but I will not let anything happen to him.

32:41.193 --> 32:43.696
You name your price, whatever it is,

32:44.396 --> 32:47.866
but under no circumstance
will you implicate my husband.

32:49.201 --> 32:50.612
If I'm hearing you clearly...

32:50.669 --> 32:52.842
You heard me clearly, Judge.

32:53.872 --> 32:56.284
I'll be in touch with you tomorrow.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.112
Love the garden.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.190
Hello, Nicole.

33:11.890 --> 33:13.631
If you insist on calling me that name,

33:13.692 --> 33:16.298
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ignore you.

33:16.361 --> 33:20.400
Nicole, Elizabeth, Wallace,
Hitchens, Haynes, whatever.

33:20.465 --> 33:23.674
All of you are under arrest
for attempted bribery.

33:25.270 --> 33:27.216
Since we believe she
obtained her citizenship

33:27.272 --> 33:29.479
using a false identity,

33:29.541 --> 33:31.111
she's a foreign national

33:31.176 --> 33:34.180
with no status and no right
to the usual protections.

33:34.246 --> 33:35.953
How long is that going to fly?

33:36.014 --> 33:39.518
Hopefully long enough to get
probable cause to test her blood

33:39.584 --> 33:41.461
for anthrax exposure,

33:41.520 --> 33:45.525
proving once and for all
that she is Nicole Wallace.

33:48.760 --> 33:52.674
What a clever pair you are, with
your phony extradition request.

33:53.365 --> 33:56.676
And that judge, oh, he was very convincing.

33:57.836 --> 33:59.213
I'd keep an eye on him if I were you.

33:59.271 --> 34:01.182
He might actually be taking bribes.

34:02.707 --> 34:06.018
You know, let's put aside
Elizabeth Hitchens' crimes.

34:06.711 --> 34:09.783
Let's talk about Nicole
Wallace and her crimes.

34:14.452 --> 34:17.728
That's the anthrax you left
on the train to Montreal.

34:17.789 --> 34:21.703
Along with the booster Connie Matson
got for you before you killed her.

34:23.695 --> 34:27.666
Where did you find her, at a
bar near the Air Force base?

34:27.732 --> 34:31.043
You slept with her, is that
how you gained her trust?

34:31.335 --> 34:34.373
Fire up your imagination
all you want, Detectives,

34:34.873 --> 34:36.681
you won't provoke me.

34:37.809 --> 34:40.050
And then there's Dan Croydon.

34:41.279 --> 34:42.815
You find out where he was staying.

34:42.880 --> 34:45.760
You invited yourself up to his room.

34:45.817 --> 34:49.458
You commiserated with him
and then suggested that

34:50.688 --> 34:52.668
he vent his outrage on paper.

34:52.724 --> 34:54.362
You made sure he was good and drunk,

34:54.426 --> 34:57.236
and then you got him in the
shower and strung him up.

34:57.295 --> 34:59.866
All that, and she can bake a cake, too.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.506
Really, Detectives.

35:04.069 --> 35:05.343
Hold on.

35:10.809 --> 35:14.757
There's a leak in the anthrax bag.
It spilled onto the table.

35:14.813 --> 35:17.350
It's okay. It's not weaponized.
It'll stick to the surface.

35:17.415 --> 35:18.758
It won't float around.

35:18.817 --> 35:21.024
EAMES: I'll get a HAZMAT guy up here.

35:21.086 --> 35:24.090
It's an emergency kit.
They give us these things

35:24.823 --> 35:27.360
in case something like this happens.

35:30.228 --> 35:31.639
Your hands.

35:34.099 --> 35:35.976
You touched the table here.

35:36.034 --> 35:37.445
So did you.

35:37.602 --> 35:40.947
We were vaccinated after 9/11.

35:42.273 --> 35:43.980
There's no problem.

35:45.343 --> 35:48.722
But you... You touched your face,

35:48.780 --> 35:50.453
your mouth, and...

35:50.515 --> 35:52.358
Yes, please save me.

35:52.417 --> 35:55.955
I've been mortally contaminated
with what? What is this,

35:56.388 --> 35:58.425
confectioner's sugar?

35:58.857 --> 36:00.461
You don't believe it's anthrax.

36:00.525 --> 36:02.061
Fool me once, Detective.

36:02.127 --> 36:05.438
I doubt even you would throw
around bags of lethal anthrax.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.670
Well, there's a detection kit.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.877
It's easy to find out.

36:15.340 --> 36:16.614
Give me your hand.

36:22.280 --> 36:25.420
If you just wanted to hold my hand, Bobby,

36:27.052 --> 36:30.898
you really didn't have
to go through such measures.

36:34.325 --> 36:36.566
Is it everything you imagined?

36:38.263 --> 36:40.174
Don't flatter yourself.

36:41.933 --> 36:44.641
I see in you what your other conquests don't.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.979
Right, the famous Goren vision.

36:47.672 --> 36:51.916
A little shortsighted lately, though,
with one glaring blind spot.

36:53.578 --> 36:55.819
Well, we all have our off days.

36:58.316 --> 37:00.853
Just a couple of drops on this strip,

37:01.986 --> 37:04.398
and then we'll see if it's anthrax.

37:05.223 --> 37:09.137
Did it ever occur to you
how much you despised him?

37:09.994 --> 37:11.064
Who? Croydon?

37:11.129 --> 37:14.110
No. Daddies, Bobby, the subject is Daddies.

37:14.466 --> 37:16.207
I was stunned to discover

37:16.267 --> 37:19.544
divorce decrees were matters
of public record here.

37:20.438 --> 37:23.749
While reading between the lines
of your parents' divorce,

37:23.808 --> 37:26.789
I gather your Daddy was quite the bon vivant.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.722
He liked a good time.

37:32.650 --> 37:34.288
Tell me, Bobby,

37:34.352 --> 37:36.423
when he ran out on your poor mother,

37:37.021 --> 37:40.764
it was her you blamed, wasn't
it, for driving him away?

37:44.496 --> 37:46.874
Yeah. Yes, I did.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.411
You were 11.

37:52.137 --> 37:54.845
You thought Daddy was fun and exciting.

37:55.707 --> 37:58.711
Boys are supposed to look up to their Daddies.

37:58.977 --> 38:01.924
But now you worry you're too much
of a chip off the old block.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.982
Is that why you haven't married?

38:04.048 --> 38:07.257
You're afraid that maybe you'll be the
model husband that your Daddy was?

38:07.318 --> 38:08.524
No.

38:10.555 --> 38:13.832
You remember the rules. Tit for tat.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.129
And what about your father?

38:17.195 --> 38:19.175
Did you ever confront him
for what he did to you?

38:19.230 --> 38:22.336
Did you ever bring him
to account for his abuse?

38:26.237 --> 38:28.911
You never even admitted it to yourself.

38:29.874 --> 38:31.876
This doesn't concern me.

38:32.043 --> 38:34.023
You've become the abuser

38:35.480 --> 38:37.721
of that sparkling little girl.

38:40.018 --> 38:41.656
You pimp her out.

38:42.887 --> 38:45.834
You make her sleep with men and
women she doesn't want to,

38:45.890 --> 38:50.066
what, to serve your pathological needs

38:50.128 --> 38:52.074
and theirs.

38:54.132 --> 38:56.373
Well, this will come as news to Gavin.

38:56.434 --> 38:59.210
You know, we've fooled ourselves
into thinking we're in love.

38:59.270 --> 39:01.944
Thank God Detective Goren
is here to save us.

39:02.006 --> 39:05.783
No. You just listen to me!
Just listen to me now!

39:05.844 --> 39:09.291
My, how you hate being contradicted.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.898
I believe that there is a part of you

39:27.165 --> 39:28.803
that loves Gavin.

39:31.436 --> 39:33.473
The decent part of Nicole

39:33.972 --> 39:37.215
that's hidden in that bunker you call a heart.

39:40.144 --> 39:42.681
You know, the last time you sat here,

39:43.081 --> 39:45.061
you confronted the truth.

39:48.186 --> 39:49.665
It hurt,

39:52.490 --> 39:54.868
so you had to shoot the messenger.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.064
Hmm?

39:57.562 --> 40:00.065
If I could be wrong about Dan Croydon,

40:00.131 --> 40:02.407
then how could I be right about you?

40:02.467 --> 40:04.071
Well, you blew it, Nicole.

40:04.135 --> 40:07.309
Your one chance for happiness with Gavin.

40:12.810 --> 40:14.585
One chance,

40:15.113 --> 40:17.320
and you had to come back to me?

40:18.917 --> 40:21.397
You couldn't leave well enough alone.

40:24.555 --> 40:26.626
That's the price of denial.

40:32.363 --> 40:35.276
Look, it's positive for anthrax.

40:38.803 --> 40:42.012
- You don't seem concerned.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
- I heard.

40:42.073 --> 40:44.519
You've been exposed to anthrax.

40:44.575 --> 40:46.714
No cause for alarm, Detective.

40:47.211 --> 40:49.157
I've been vaccinated for anthrax

40:49.213 --> 40:52.524
along with millions of my fellow Australians.

41:00.391 --> 41:02.462
Including Nicole Wallace.

41:02.627 --> 41:06.404
Yeah. She was vaccinated
in 1996, in Bendigo.

41:07.899 --> 41:10.743
One year before she met Dan Croydon.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.282
And her records show

41:14.305 --> 41:18.412
that her last booster was over 2 years ago.

41:19.811 --> 41:21.290
On the other hand,

41:21.346 --> 41:24.816
there's no record that shows
Elizabeth Hitchens

41:24.882 --> 41:27.021
has ever been vaccinated.

41:27.085 --> 41:29.998
So if, in fact, you are Elizabeth,

41:32.090 --> 41:35.333
you would be alarmed.

41:36.995 --> 41:39.498
You'd be screaming for medical help.

41:42.567 --> 41:47.539
You might still have enough time to
put on a convincing performance.

41:56.681 --> 41:58.285
(CLEARING THROAT)

41:59.417 --> 42:01.658
This is proof of what? Nothing.

42:01.719 --> 42:04.859
Not quite. It's probable
cause for a blood test,

42:04.922 --> 42:08.199
which will reveal your recent exposure
to the South African anthrax.

42:08.259 --> 42:11.832
And that, Ms. Wallace,
is proof of everything.

42:13.464 --> 42:16.274
Well, of course I've been exposed to that.

42:16.934 --> 42:18.880
Isn't that part of your little charade?

42:18.936 --> 42:23.578
This? No, that's a different
strain of anthrax.

42:24.275 --> 42:28.052
A genetically impaired harmless strain.

42:28.413 --> 42:32.725
You don't seriously think he'd toss
about bags of lethal anthrax, do you?

42:37.688 --> 42:41.329
Don't think for one second that
this is the end of us, Bobby.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.336
When the blood test came back positive,

42:50.401 --> 42:51.937
I thought she'd jump at a plea,

42:52.003 --> 42:54.108
but she's insisting on a trial.

42:54.172 --> 42:57.176
Sure, with Gavin Haynes footing the bill.

42:58.843 --> 43:01.449
Well, it's your turn in the barrel now.

43:01.612 --> 43:03.250
I'm done with her.

43:05.083 --> 43:06.926
Here, have one.

43:09.554 --> 43:10.999
What's this?

43:12.390 --> 43:13.596
Scones.

43:14.305 --> 43:20.945
