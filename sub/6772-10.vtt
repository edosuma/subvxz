WEBVTT

00:07.036 --> 00:11.029
(Fluttershy singing tunelessly to herself)

00:11.029 --> 00:13.816
(squirrel chattering)

00:13.816 --> 00:16.533
Fluttershy: Thank you, little squirrel!

00:16.533 --> 00:20.526
But remember, these flowers are for Princess Celestia.

00:20.526 --> 00:22.895
Only the prettiest ones will do.

00:22.895 --> 00:24.381
(wind blows)

00:24.381 --> 00:26.796
(squirrel chatters sheepishly)

00:28.468 --> 00:30.859
(Flutershy singing to self tunelessly)

00:30.859 --> 00:32.067
(chirp, Fluttershy shrieks)

00:32.067 --> 00:33.321
(thud)

00:37.407 --> 00:38.754
(creature chirps)

00:38.754 --> 00:41.308
(gently) Hello, little guy!

00:41.308 --> 00:44.838
I've never seen anything like you before.

00:45.952 --> 00:48.739
Oh, are you hungry?

00:48.739 --> 00:50.875
(apple squishes)

00:50.875 --> 00:52.082
Here you go.

00:52.082 --> 00:55.519
(sound of buzzsaw grinding, basket thuds)

00:55.519 --> 00:58.677
(Fluttershy gasps) I guess you WERE hungry.

00:58.677 --> 01:02.346
(creature purrs)

01:03.739 --> 01:07.361
You're the cutest thing EVER!

01:07.361 --> 01:09.833
I can't wait to show you to my friends.

01:15.117 --> 01:21.154
(theme song begins) My Little Pony, My Little Pony, ah, ah, ah, ah,

01:21.154 --> 01:25.566
(My Little Pony) Twilight: I used to wonder what friendship could be

01:25.566 --> 01:29.629
(My Little Pony) Until you all shared its magic with me

01:29.629 --> 01:31.858
Rainbow Dash: Big adventure
Pinkie Pie: Tons of fun

01:31.858 --> 01:34.041
Rarity: A beautiful heart
Applejack: Faithful and strong

01:34.041 --> 01:35.945
Fluttershy: Sharing kindness
Twilight: It's an easy feat

01:35.945 --> 01:38.406
All: And magic makes it all complete, yeah

01:38.406 --> 01:46.095
(My Little Pony) Do you know, you're all my very best friends

01:52.942 --> 01:56.029
Twilight: (harried) Oh, hurry up, Spike! This place isn't gonna clean itself!

01:56.286 --> 01:58.065
Spike: (under breath) It also didn't mess itself up.

01:58.654 --> 02:01.053
Twilight: Princess Celestia will be here tomorrow!

02:01.533 --> 02:04.058
Spike: I thought this was just an unofficial casual visit.

02:04.575 --> 02:07.036
Twilight: There's nothing CASUAL about a visit from ROYALTY!

02:07.361 --> 02:10.074
I want this place to be spotless, and you've 
 barely made a dent in the clutter!

02:10.752 --> 02:15.040
Spike: (out of breath) Maybe you should start reading them...one at a time- whoooa!

02:15.396 --> 02:16.046
(books crash, Spike grunts)

02:16.464 --> 02:19.081
Twilight: Everything's got to be perfect. No time for fooling around.

02:19.807 --> 02:25.015
Spike: (shoving books aside) You know, this would be an awful lot easier 
 if there weren't two of us here getting under each other's feet!

02:25.148 --> 02:28.096
Twilight: Great idea! You clean; I'll go see how everyone else's preparations are coming.

02:28.956 --> 02:30.030
Spike: Maybe I should-

02:30.303 --> 02:32.016
(Spike groans exasperatedly, door slams)

02:37.872 --> 02:41.059
(ponies chattering)

02:46.928 --> 02:48.046
Twilight: What happened to the rest of her name?

02:48.461 --> 02:50.088
Carrot: We couldn't fit it all in.

02:50.876 --> 02:53.038
Twilight: You can't hang a banner that says, "Welcome Princess Celest!"

02:53.383 --> 02:55.001
Take it down and try again.

02:58.091 --> 03:01.093
Twilight: (approving) That looks perfect. Keep up the good work.

03:10.334 --> 03:12.038
Twilight: Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cake!

03:12.377 --> 03:13.058
How's the banquet coming?

03:13.585 --> 03:17.002
Mrs. Cake: (agitated) It would be coming a little better...

03:20.179 --> 03:23.020
(cake splats, Pinkie Pie eats noisily)

03:23.198 --> 03:25.047
(Pinkie Pie slurps)

03:25.473 --> 03:28.007
Twilight: (shocked) Pinkie! WHAT are you doing?!

03:28.074 --> 03:30.063
Those sweets are supposed to be for the princess!

03:30.628 --> 03:33.018
Pinkie Pie: Aaah, I know! That's why I'm tasting them!

03:33.182 --> 03:38.010
Somepony needs to make sure that everything is tasty 
 enough to (garbled) tosh the royal togue,

03:38.105 --> 03:40.015
(theatrically) and I, Pinkie Pie,

03:40.148 --> 03:46.028
declare that these treats are fit for a 
 KING, or a QUEEN, or a PRINCESS.

03:46.278 --> 03:48.065
Fluttershy: ...Twilight! Pinkie!

03:48.647 --> 03:55.001
You won't believe...oh...I'm sorry...am I interrupting?

03:55.009 --> 03:56.040
Pinkie Pie: No, not at all!

03:56.402 --> 03:59.047
Come on in and make yourself at home! (noisy chomp and slurp)

04:00.628 --> 04:01.098
Pinkie Pie: What's goin' on, Fluttershy?

04:01.975 --> 04:05.064
Fluttershy: You won't believe what I found at the edge of the Everfree Forest!

04:05.644 --> 04:08.048
(gently) Come on out, little guy.

04:08.477 --> 04:09.054
It's okay.

04:09.545 --> 04:10.057
(pop)

04:11.286 --> 04:14.021
(creatures purr)
(gasp) Three?

04:14.212 --> 04:16.026
Twilight: They're amazing!

04:16.255 --> 04:17.065
What are they?

04:17.649 --> 04:22.043
Fluttershy: I'm not sure. I'm also not sure where these other two came from.

04:22.432 --> 04:24.024
Twilight: I'll take one off your hooves.

04:24.243 --> 04:28.075
I've never seen anything so... (gushing) adorable.

04:28.748 --> 04:34.041
(sheepish) Besides, it'll be nice to have a companion for Spike 
 so he won't bother me so much while I'm studying.

04:34.413 --> 04:37.011
Fluttershy: Pinkie? Do you want the other one?

04:37.107 --> 04:40.022
Pinkie Pie: (disgusted) UGH! A parasprite?! [parasite + sprite] Are you KIDDING?!

04:40.958 --> 04:43.024
Fluttershy: "Ugh?"
Twilight: A para-what?

04:43.237 --> 04:44.072
Fluttershy: How could she not like-

04:44.723 --> 04:47.037
Pinkie Pie: (exasperated groan) Now I gotta go find a trombone!

04:47.037 --> 04:49.009
Twilight: ...A what?!

04:49.088 --> 04:52.052
Pinkie Pie: A trombone! You know... (imitates trombone)

04:52.989 --> 04:56.019
Twilight: (sighs) Typical Pinkie.
(parasprite purrs)

04:58.875 --> 05:01.032
Rarity: Stand STILL, Rainbow Dash!

05:01.325 --> 05:03.046
Rainbow Dash: (pouts) I caaaan't!

05:03.462 --> 05:05.013
I need to fly!

05:05.133 --> 05:07.087
This is waaaay too boring for me.

05:07.873 --> 05:11.036
Rarity: DO you want to look nice for Princess Celestia or not?

05:12.075 --> 05:17.053
Twilight: (in awe) Wooow! Rarity, those outfits are gorgeous!

05:17.533 --> 05:22.050
Rarity: (flattered) Thank you, Twilight. Nice to know SOMEone appreciates my talents.

05:22.502 --> 05:25.094
Rainbow Dash: Ugh. SO booooring. (snap)

05:25.939 --> 05:27.047
(parasprite chirps)

05:27.471 --> 05:30.016
Rarity: Huh?
Rainbow Dash: What's that sound, Twilight?

05:30.165 --> 05:34.011
(parasprites chirp)

05:35.087 --> 05:37.027
Rainbow Dash: Wow! What are they?

05:37.027 --> 05:41.087
Twilight: The better question is, where did they come 
 from? I only had one a minute ago.

05:41.867 --> 05:43.035
Rainbow Dash: Uh, I'll take one.

05:43.353 --> 05:45.095
Rarity: (gushing) Me too! Oh, they're PERFECT!

05:45.954 --> 05:48.072
Pinkie Pie: Does anypony know where to find an accordion?!

05:48.717 --> 05:49.075
(all but Pinkie Pie making baby noises)

05:49.075 --> 05:51.088
Girls! Helloooo?!

05:51.875 --> 05:53.018
This is important!

05:53.176 --> 05:55.026
(exasperated groan) Thanks a LOT.

05:57.727 --> 05:59.054
(owl hoots)

06:04.042 --> 06:07.057
Twilight: (sighs) The decorations, the banquet...

06:07.572 --> 06:10.045
I really hope everything comes together in time for tomorrow.

06:10.451 --> 06:28.005
(Spike and parasprite snoring)

06:18.671 --> 06:22.011
Twilight: (yawns) What's there to worry about?

06:28.052 --> 06:38.008
(many parasprites snoring in discordant harmony)

06:38.083 --> 06:39.071
Twilight: SPIKE! (crashes to floor)

06:39.708 --> 06:42.022
Wake up! What happened?!

06:42.216 --> 06:44.021
Spike: Huh...? (screams)

06:44.213 --> 06:45.088
(pop) What's goin' on?!

06:45.885 --> 06:48.030
Twilight: Where did they come from?!

06:48.003 --> 06:51.004
Spike: I dunno. The little guy got hungry in the night,

06:51.004 --> 06:54.062
so I gave him a snack, but...I have 
 no idea where these others came from!

06:54.616 --> 06:56.006
(crash)

06:56.055 --> 06:59.044
Oh no! They're messing up all my hard work!

06:59.445 --> 07:03.007
(books falling to ground)

07:03.068 --> 07:05.016
Twilight: (worried) The princess will be here in a few hours!

07:05.157 --> 07:06.078
(Spike grunts, crashes)

07:10.196 --> 07:12.070
Twilight: Spike, help me round up these little guys!

07:12.704 --> 07:16.051
Spike: (harried) What does...it look like...I'm doin'?!
(parasprites wobble)

07:16.512 --> 07:18.070
Whoa, aaah! (crashes, grunts)

07:18.695 --> 07:20.012
(feather duster shaking rapidly)

07:20.125 --> 07:24.018
(resigned) I know, I know. "Stop foolin' around."

07:28.656 --> 07:31.017
(Rainbow Dash snoring lightly)

07:31.167 --> 07:33.011
(pop, parasprite chirps)

07:33.114 --> 07:38.013
(parasprites chirp)
Rainbow Dash: (groggily) Huh...? Huh?

07:41.938 --> 07:44.003
GET OFF!

07:44.028 --> 07:46.044
(Rainbow Dash groans)

07:46.442 --> 07:49.000
Eugh! Get OFF me!

07:48.997 --> 07:52.039
(flails and grunts)

07:55.359 --> 07:57.031
(grunts)

07:58.075 --> 08:01.007
(screams, fades into distance)

08:01.953 --> 08:07.057
Rarity: Not only are you ADORABLE, but you're also quite useful!

08:07.573 --> 08:11.089
(parasprite purrs, gags)
Rarity: (worried) Oh! Are you okay?

08:11.892 --> 08:13.028
(splat, Rarity yelps in disgust)

08:13.285 --> 08:16.063
(gasp) Eeewwwww!

08:16.628 --> 08:18.072
(pop)

08:18.718 --> 08:21.060
(repulsed) AAAH! Gross gross GROSS!

08:21.597 --> 08:25.045
No creature that behaves so REVOLTINGLY is allowed in my boutique!

08:25.452 --> 08:28.001
(parasprite gags noisily, coughs)

08:28.006 --> 08:28.094
(pop)

08:28.935 --> 08:30.065
(Rarity shrieks)

08:31.628 --> 08:36.023
Pinkie Pie: Look, Rarity! Applejack lent me her harmonica! (plays scales) Isn't that GREAT?!

08:36.226 --> 08:37.039
(parasprites chirp)

08:37.386 --> 08:39.038
(gasps) And not a moment too soon!

08:39.384 --> 08:42.039
Rarity: (sighs) Pinkie, I'm a little busy right now.

08:42.403 --> 08:43.038
Pinkie Pie: And I'm NOT?!

08:43.378 --> 08:45.005
Do you know how many more instruments I've gotta find?!

08:45.005 --> 08:46.068
A LOT. That's how many.

08:46.675 --> 08:49.093
Now, if we split the work between us, 
 we MIGHT just make it in time!

08:49.926 --> 08:53.087
Rarity: PLEASE, Pinkie! I don't have time for some silly scavenger hunt!

08:53.873 --> 08:55.050
I've got a REAL problem!

08:55.499 --> 08:57.054
Pinkie Pie: You've got a real problem, all right,

08:57.542 --> 09:00.033
and a banjo is the only answer!

09:02.232 --> 09:04.079
(Twilight and Rarity gasp in turn)

09:04.787 --> 09:08.022
(bag rustles)
Rarity: I see we're having the same problem.

09:08.223 --> 09:09.038
Rainbow Dash: Ditto!

09:12.356 --> 09:14.040
Twilight: Fluttershy knows everything about animals.

09:14.004 --> 09:17.019
(unconvinced) I'm sure she can tell us how to stop them.

09:17.186 --> 09:20.044
(door slams, parasprites chirp)

09:21.417 --> 09:22.039
Twilight: ...Or not.

09:24.059 --> 09:27.087
Twilight: Do something, Fluttershy! Can't you control them?!

09:27.867 --> 09:29.054
Fluttershy: (frantically) I've tried everything I know!

09:29.539 --> 09:31.086
I've tried begging, and pleading, and beseeching,

09:31.861 --> 09:33.039
and asking politely, and...

09:33.394 --> 09:34.014
(Rainbow Dash grunts in disgust)

09:38.125 --> 09:41.078
(royal fanfare)

09:41.776 --> 09:47.091
(Princess Celestia screams, protests incoherently)

09:47.906 --> 09:50.060
Twilight: If we can't get them under control before the princess arrives,

09:50.006 --> 09:52.046
it'll be TOTAL DISASTER!

09:52.457 --> 09:53.085
(parasprite hacks, pop)

09:53.085 --> 09:57.019
Rarity: (repulsed) Eeewww! If you ask me, it's ALREADY a total disaster!

09:57.194 --> 10:00.003
(cart rolling)
Applejack: Here's all those apples you wanted, Fluttershy,

10:00.027 --> 10:04.021
but I still can't figure why ya need so many. (buzzsaw grinding) HEY!

10:04.206 --> 10:05.083
Fluttershy: What do we do?!

10:05.832 --> 10:09.050
Twilight: (gasps) I got it! NOpony can herd like Applejack!

10:09.501 --> 10:12.043
Rainbow Dash: Yeah! We can drive 'em back into the forest!

10:12.426 --> 10:15.082
Applejack: I'll wrassle 'em up, but I'll need everypony's help t'do it.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.023
Twilight, you and Rarity wait over there.

10:18.231 --> 10:20.055
I'll herd the little critters straight atcha like a funnel.

10:20.553 --> 10:25.034
Rainbow Dash, you'n'Fluttershy stay on top of 'em; don't let 'em fly away.

10:25.337 --> 10:26.003
Rainbow Dash: Aye, aye!

10:26.033 --> 10:29.014
Applejack: YEEE-HAW!

10:42.426 --> 10:47.040
Applejack: All right, y'all, here goes nothin'!

10:47.396 --> 10:50.055
Look out, Rarity! That one's fixin' to get away!
(country music)

10:50.553 --> 10:52.074
Keep a lean on 'em, Rainbow Dash!
(country music)

10:52.736 --> 10:54.057
(country music)

10:54.571 --> 10:57.012
Hold on, girls! We're almost there!
(country music)

10:57.125 --> 10:58.047
Twilight: Pinkie!
(country music)

10:58.471 --> 11:00.056
Pinkie Pie: Twilight! We don't have much time!
(country music)

11:00.561 --> 11:03.044
Twilight: You're telling me! The princess could arrive at any moment!
(country music)

11:03.441 --> 11:08.074
Pinkie Pie: Exactly. That's why I need you girls to drop 
 what you're doing and help me find some maracas!
(country music)

11:08.735 --> 11:13.010
Twilight: Maracas..? Pinkie, we've got much bigger problems than missing maracas!
(country music)

11:13.001 --> 11:14.052
Pinkie Pie: (gasps) You're RIGHT!
(country music)

11:14.516 --> 11:17.000
Getting a TUBA has to be our number one goal!
(country music)

11:17.000 --> 11:17.098
Follow me!
(country music)

11:17.976 --> 11:19.067
(country music)

11:19.671 --> 11:21.067
I said, "FOLLOW ME!"
(country music)

11:21.668 --> 11:25.071
Rainbow Dash: Pinkie Pie? You are SO random.
(country music)

11:25.708 --> 11:28.026
Pinkie Pie: And you're all so STUBBORN!
(country music)

11:28.263 --> 11:30.054
Applejack: Forget her, ladies.
(country music)

11:30.538 --> 11:33.035
Focus! Head 'em up and move 'em out!
(country music)

11:33.348 --> 11:37.057
(rumbling)
(country music)

11:37.574 --> 11:40.089
(rumbling fades away)
(country music ends)

11:40.894 --> 11:42.061
Rainbow Dash: All right!

11:42.613 --> 11:44.010
(grunts, hollow clank noise)

11:44.099 --> 11:45.007
Fluttershy: Ouch...

11:45.074 --> 11:47.081
Twilight: We did it! Nice work, Applejack!

11:47.814 --> 11:50.037
Applejack: Couldn't-a done it without y'all!

11:50.368 --> 11:53.080
Twilight: Now let's get back and clean up the 
 mess they made before the princess arrives!

11:55.105 --> 11:57.020
Twilight: Okay, everyone knows what to do, right?

11:57.195 --> 12:00.003
We gotta work extra hard to make up for lost time.

12:01.056 --> 12:03.088
(door slams, Fluttershy shrieks)

12:03.875 --> 12:07.034
Twilight: (gasps, drowned out by wind) Where did THEY come from?!

12:07.342 --> 12:10.078
Fluttershy: (sheepishly) Well, I may have kept just one...

12:10.778 --> 12:12.036
(Fluttershy chuckles weakly)

12:13.611 --> 12:15.075
(defensively) I couldn't help myself!

12:15.747 --> 12:18.081
They're just...so...cute...

12:18.813 --> 12:21.032
Twilight: We don't have time to keep rounding up these things!

12:21.032 --> 12:22.067
What do we do now?!

12:22.667 --> 12:25.031
Rainbow Dash: We call in the weather patrol!

12:27.125 --> 12:29.045
(Rarity shrieks)

12:30.701 --> 12:33.086
Time to take out the adorable trash.

12:33.859 --> 12:36.023
(battle cry, beating chest)

12:36.227 --> 12:37.099
(parasprites chirp, Rainbow Dash whooshes past)

12:37.992 --> 12:44.017
(whooshing increases in frequency, wind picks up)

12:44.169 --> 12:47.033
(wind whooshing loudly, vacuum sucking noises)

12:47.327 --> 12:50.058
(ponies groaning)

12:50.577 --> 12:55.008
(vacuum sucking)
Twilight: Way to go, Rainbow Dash!

12:55.082 --> 12:57.061
Applejack: Looks like our problems are solved!

12:57.613 --> 12:59.052
Pinkie Pie: They will be with these cymbals!

12:59.517 --> 13:02.068
(yelps) Give those back!

13:04.254 --> 13:07.088
(Rainbow Dash yelping)

13:07.876 --> 13:10.099
Rainbow Dash: I can't hold it!

13:10.988 --> 13:13.036
She's breaking up!

13:14.796 --> 13:15.063
(thud)

13:20.875 --> 13:24.057
Twilight: Pinkie Pie! WHAT have you DONE?!

13:24.571 --> 13:27.068
Pinkie Pie: I just lost a brand-new pair of cymbals, that's what I've done!

13:27.683 --> 13:31.035
Twilight: Will you forget about your silly instruments for one second?!

13:31.352 --> 13:34.007
You're ruining our efforts to save Ponyville!

13:34.068 --> 13:36.053
Pinkie Pie: (incredulous) ME?! Ruin?!

13:36.053 --> 13:39.036
I'm not the ruinER, I'm the ruinEE!

13:39.363 --> 13:41.064
...Or is it "ruiness?"

13:41.638 --> 13:42.057
..."Ruinette?"

13:42.567 --> 13:46.014
Applejack: Come on, girls! There's no reasoning with that one.

13:46.143 --> 13:48.028
She's a few apples short of a bushel.

13:48.279 --> 13:53.080
Pinkie Pie: Hey! I'm trying to tell you all 
 that the ruining is on the other hoof!

13:53.805 --> 13:55.099
If you'd just slow down and LISTEN TO ME!

14:02.582 --> 14:04.025
(parasprite chirps)

14:05.926 --> 14:09.094
(parasprite eats noisily, pony gasps)

14:12.073 --> 14:16.003
(buzzsaw grinding, loud munching, pony gasps)

14:16.027 --> 14:20.008
(commotion)

14:20.083 --> 14:23.060
Fluttershy: What do we do? They're eating all the food in town.

14:23.597 --> 14:24.094
Applejack: (gasps) My apples!

14:25.965 --> 14:27.054
Twilight: We've gotta do something!

14:28.566 --> 14:30.033
(gasps) I've got it!

14:30.033 --> 14:32.098
I'll cast a spell to make them stop eating all the food!

14:32.977 --> 14:37.048
(radar pings)

14:46.073 --> 14:48.007
Pinkie Pie: Look! Tambourines!

14:48.007 --> 14:49.014
If you can all just-

14:49.139 --> 14:52.039
(frustrated scream)

14:54.005 --> 14:55.027
(Twilight gasps)

14:56.043 --> 14:57.059
(parasprite chirps)

14:57.591 --> 14:59.022
(Twilight sighs with relief)

15:00.423 --> 15:01.091
(parasprite munches noisily)

15:01.909 --> 15:03.012
(pop)

15:04.278 --> 15:05.025
(chomp)

15:05.253 --> 15:06.060
(chomp)

15:07.529 --> 15:11.010
(buzzsaw grinding)

15:11.105 --> 15:14.054
Rainbow Dash: (sarcastic) Hey. It worked.

15:14.541 --> 15:16.072
They're not eating the FOOD anymore.

15:18.442 --> 15:21.037
Rarity: Oh no...if they get inside my store...

15:21.368 --> 15:24.048
(hysterical) EVERYPONY FOR HERSELF!

15:28.241 --> 15:30.024
MY OUTFITS!

15:31.956 --> 15:34.079
(parasprites munching noisily)

15:34.789 --> 15:37.072
Go on, shoo! Get out of here! Naughty, naughty!

15:37.715 --> 15:39.034
(parasprite gags, coughs)

15:41.476 --> 15:46.077
(Rarity shrieking)
Pinkie Pie: I'LL SAVE YOU!

15:50.532 --> 15:51.097
(blows recorder, produces flat, dissonant note)

15:54.433 --> 15:57.064
(Rarity shrieks)

15:57.637 --> 16:01.082
Applejack: No woodland creature's gonna eat the Apple Family crop!

16:01.817 --> 16:06.037
(rumbling, banjo music rising in pitch and tempo)
Brace yourself, y'all!

16:06.368 --> 16:07.039
Here they come!

16:07.039 --> 16:10.055
(music crescendos)

16:13.009 --> 16:16.021
(buzzsaw grinding, wood creaking)

16:16.213 --> 16:17.084
(crash)

16:17.839 --> 16:21.069
Applejack: (gasps) ...Didn't see that one comin'...

16:25.548 --> 16:26.071
Spike: (panicked) HELP!

16:27.087 --> 16:29.040
(books flying)

16:29.402 --> 16:31.007
(slurp, Twilight gasps)

16:31.074 --> 16:32.093
Twilight: They're eating the WORDS!

16:32.932 --> 16:34.060
(slurping)

16:40.000 --> 16:41.004
Spike: (voice breaking) Help...

16:47.235 --> 16:50.000
(door slams, Zecora flails, falls, grunts)

16:49.975 --> 16:51.007
Zecora: Have you gone mad?

16:51.693 --> 16:55.008
Twilight: (spits) Zecora! These little guys are devouring Ponyville!

16:55.078 --> 16:58.009
And the princess is on her way! Can you help us? Please?!

16:58.938 --> 17:06.000
Zecora: (metric speech) O monster of so little size, 
 is that a parasprite before my eyes?

17:06.042 --> 17:07.003
Twilight: I dunno! Is it?!

17:08.782 --> 17:16.003
Zecora: (somber metric speech) Tales of crops and harvests 
 consumed. If these creatures are in Ponyville...you're doomed.

17:17.746 --> 17:18.007
(Twilight gulps)

17:20.486 --> 17:21.005
(Twilight grunts)

17:23.505 --> 17:26.002
Twilight: Oh no! Here she comes!

17:30.875 --> 17:36.007
(ponies panicking)

17:36.005 --> 17:38.002
(snap)

17:38.203 --> 17:41.006
Twilight: Okay! Here's the plan. Rainbow Dash, you distract them.

17:41.064 --> 17:43.002
(Rainbow Dash screams)

17:43.172 --> 17:47.002
(ponies screaming in background)
Good! Everyone else, we need to 
 build an exact copy of Ponyville right there.

17:47.166 --> 17:48.005
We've got less than a minute!

17:49.906 --> 17:51.004
(loud crash in background)

17:51.438 --> 17:54.000
(crestfallen) Zecora was right. We're doomed.

17:54.039 --> 17:57.006
(fanfare)
Oh no! The princess' procession is here!

17:57.568 --> 17:59.003
(lively band music plays)
It's all over!

17:59.292 --> 18:02.001
(lively band music)

18:02.012 --> 18:05.004
(Twilight doubletakes)
(lively band music)

18:05.037 --> 18:09.007
Pinkie! We're in the middle of a crisis here!
(lively band music)

18:09.689 --> 18:13.002
This is no time for your...(confused) nonsense...?
(lively band music)

18:13.219 --> 18:34.001
(lively band music)

18:34.093 --> 18:36.005
Twilight: Look!
(lively band music)

18:36.462 --> 18:46.003
(lively band music)

18:46.033 --> 18:49.002
Celestia: Twilight Sparkle, my prized pupil.
(lively band music)

18:49.021 --> 18:50.008
Twilight: (nervous) Hello, Princess!
(lively band music)

18:50.835 --> 18:54.000
Celestia: So lovely to see you again, as 
 well as your friends.
(lively band music approaching)

18:54.039 --> 18:59.009
(lively band music)

18:59.868 --> 19:02.001
Twilight: (nervous) So, how was the trip?
(lively band music)

19:02.143 --> 19:03.003
(joking awkwardly) Get much traffic?
(lively band music)

19:03.258 --> 19:06.003
Celestia: Ah, what is this? (parasprite chirps)
(lively band music)

19:06.323 --> 19:11.006
(giggles) These creatures are adorable!
(lively band music)

19:11.057 --> 19:13.008
Rainbow Dash: (under breath) They're not THAT adorable...
(lively band music)

19:13.753 --> 19:18.003
Celestia: I'm terribly honored that you and the good citizens of Ponyville
(lively band music)

19:18.281 --> 19:20.007
have organized a parade in honor of my visit.
(lively band music)

19:20.742 --> 19:24.008
Twilight: ...Parade? (feigns acknowledgment) Oh, yes! The PARADE!
(lively band music)

19:24.783 --> 19:28.009
Celestia: Unfortunately, that visit is going to have 
 to wait for another time.
(lively band music)

19:28.869 --> 19:32.004
I'm afraid an emergency has come up in Fillydelphia. [Philadelphia]
(lively band music)

19:32.352 --> 19:35.007
Apparently there's been some sort of..."infestation."
(lively band music)

19:35.742 --> 19:37.008
Twilight: (feigning innocence) An infestation?
(lively band music)

19:37.809 --> 19:43.002
Celestia: Yes, a swarm of incredibly bothersome creatures 
 has invaded the poor town.
(lively band music)

19:43.196 --> 19:47.006
I'm sorry, Twilight, to have to put you 
 all through so much trouble.
(lively band music)

19:47.561 --> 19:50.000
Twilight: (feigning ignorance) Trouble? What trouble?
(lively band music)

19:50.023 --> 19:55.007
Celestia: Before I have to go, would you care to give me your 
 latest report on the magic of friendship in person?
(lively band music)

19:55.688 --> 19:57.007
Twilight: My...report?
(lively band music)

19:57.732 --> 20:00.003
Celestia: Haven't you learned anything about friendship?
(lively band music)

20:00.286 --> 20:04.003
(lively band music)

20:04.326 --> 20:06.003
Twilight: Actually, I have.
(lively band music)

20:06.277 --> 20:11.004
I've learned that sometimes the solution to your problems can 
 come from where you least expect it.
(lively band music)

20:11.431 --> 20:15.007
It's a good idea to stop and listen to 
 your friends' ideas and perspectives,
(lively band music)

20:15.658 --> 20:17.001
(cymbals crash loudly)
(lively band music)

20:17.097 --> 20:20.007
...even when they don't always seem to make sense.
(lively band music)

20:20.719 --> 20:23.007
Celestia: I'm so proud of you, Twilight Sparkle,
(lively band music)

20:23.692 --> 20:26.002
and I'm very impressed with your friends as well.
(lively band music)

20:26.199 --> 20:29.003
It sounds like you're all learning so much from each other.
(lively band music)

20:29.311 --> 20:31.001
Twilight: Thank you, Princess.
(lively band music)

20:29.311 --> 20:35.007
Twilight: Thank you, Princess.
(lively band music)

20:35.696 --> 20:39.000
Pinkie Pie: Hey! What happened to the princess?
(music ends)

20:38.994 --> 20:40.007
Twilight: Emergency in Fillydelphia.

20:40.712 --> 20:43.005
Rainbow Dash: (hinting) Some sort of "infestation."

20:43.545 --> 20:46.002
Pinkie Pie: Oh no! Have they got parasprites, too?!

20:46.192 --> 20:48.008
Well, have tuba, will travel!

20:48.839 --> 20:51.006
(Pinkie Pie blows descending scale on tuba)
Twilight: I think the princess can handle it.

20:51.583 --> 20:55.001
Applejack: So you knew what those critters were all along, huh, Pinkie Pie?

20:55.062 --> 20:56.006
Pinkie Pie: Well, DUH!

20:56.641 --> 20:59.007
Why do you think I was so frantic to get my hooves 
 on all these instruments?!
(accordion plays discordantly as Pinkie Pie moves)

20:59.706 --> 21:01.006
I TRIED to tell you.

21:01.563 --> 21:04.002
Twilight: We know, Pinkie Pie, and we're sorry we didn't listen.

21:04.164 --> 21:06.008
(all apologizing profusely)

21:06.765 --> 21:10.009
Twilight: You're a great friend...even if we don't always understand you.

21:10.898 --> 21:15.004
Pinkie Pie: Thanks, guys! You're all great friends, too...even when I don't understand me.

21:15.356 --> 21:17.009
Twilight: You saved my reputation with Princess Celestia!

21:17.091 --> 21:21.004
And more importantly, you saved Ponyville!

21:24.644 --> 21:26.001
(crash)
Or not.

21:26.013 --> 21:30.001
(trombone "wah-wah-wah-waaaah")

21:30.728 --> 21:32.006
(ending theme begins) My Little Pony

21:34.907 --> 21:37.000
My Little Pony

21:39.004 --> 21:48.000
(instrumental)

21:48.005 --> 21:54.002
My Little Pony, friends
