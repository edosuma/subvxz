00:04.500 --> 00:06.900
Keep going, I'll catch up to you.

00:39.152 --> 00:40.152
Ay-tiff?

00:40.153 --> 00:41.954
Teef?

00:41.955 --> 00:42.821
Atif.

00:42.822 --> 00:44.422
Right, double espresso.

00:53.049 --> 00:55.083
I'm sorry, sir.

00:55.084 --> 00:56.434
Are you using this seat?

01:09.849 --> 01:11.817
Good morning.

01:13.152 --> 01:16.521
I'd like to start with the
tragic bombing in Illinois.

01:16.522 --> 01:18.573
Due to its domestic nature,

01:18.574 --> 01:20.492
the FBI is leading the investigation.

01:20.493 --> 01:23.028
Though the secretary took
over 50 calls this morning

01:23.029 --> 01:24.863
from other governments
offering their support.

01:24.864 --> 01:26.698
Richard.

01:26.699 --> 01:28.667
Is it true that three months ago,

01:28.668 --> 01:31.036
the Illinois bomber took
a trip to Saudi Arabia?

01:31.037 --> 01:33.255
Yes, for his pilgrimage to Mecca.

01:33.256 --> 01:35.123
For confirmation, I direct you

01:35.124 --> 01:39.127
to FBI Director Doherty's
press conference in two hours.

01:39.128 --> 01:40.095
Keira?

01:40.096 --> 01:42.214
Is the FBI investigating a mosque,

01:42.215 --> 01:44.549
the North Illinois Islamic Center,

01:44.550 --> 01:45.801
for funding that trip?

01:45.802 --> 01:46.935
Again, I urge you

01:46.936 --> 01:48.804
to attend the FBI briefing.

01:48.805 --> 01:50.972
I'll take non-bombing
related questions now.

01:50.973 --> 01:52.357
One more.

01:52.358 --> 01:55.610
Are you aware that State's own
speechwriter, Matthew Mahoney,

01:55.611 --> 01:57.446
a Muslim, is also a member

01:57.447 --> 01:58.980
of that mosque?

01:58.981 --> 02:01.215
I don't have any
information along those lines

02:01.303 --> 02:02.967
and I encourage you
to check your sources.

02:02.968 --> 02:04.074
So, you deny

02:04.075 --> 02:06.176
any knowledge of Mr.
Mahoney's affiliation

02:06.177 --> 02:07.878
with the mosque in question?

02:07.879 --> 02:09.913
I'm not denying anything,
but I am troubled

02:09.913 --> 02:12.349
by your attempt to link a
public servant and a terrorist

02:12.350 --> 02:14.518
based solely on their shared faith.

02:14.519 --> 02:17.654
What about a receipt
showing that, six months ago,

02:17.655 --> 02:19.356
Mr. Mahoney

02:19.357 --> 02:21.892
donated money to the
same mosque at the center

02:21.893 --> 02:25.295
of a terror investigation
for funding a domestic attack?

02:34.705 --> 02:36.106
Hey, Justin!

02:36.107 --> 02:37.641
Can you please reroute

02:37.642 --> 02:39.309
all press inquiries to Public Affairs?

02:39.310 --> 02:40.310
Absolutely, sir.

02:40.311 --> 02:41.612
And, my e-mail, man.

02:41.613 --> 02:43.113
My inbox has got more spam

02:43.114 --> 02:44.648
than a Monty Python sketch.

02:44.649 --> 02:46.912
And-and listen, if-if they
ask about this donation thing,

02:46.913 --> 02:48.318
just take a message.

02:48.319 --> 02:49.453
What if the FBI calls?

02:49.454 --> 02:50.487
That I'll take.

02:50.488 --> 02:52.556
And if my mom calls, get me immediately.

02:54.859 --> 02:56.260
How could you let The
Chronicle sideswipe me

02:56.261 --> 02:57.327
with this donation thing?

02:57.328 --> 02:58.795
When were you planning to tell me?

02:58.796 --> 03:01.898
What, that I'm a half-Pakistani
agnostic cultural Muslim

03:01.899 --> 03:04.501
who never practices and
sometimes donates money

03:04.502 --> 03:05.902
to his mom's mosque?

03:05.903 --> 03:07.271
Pretty sure you knew most of that.

03:07.272 --> 03:08.839
Hey, the minute you found
out this guy was affiliated

03:08.840 --> 03:10.240
with your congregation, you sh...

03:10.241 --> 03:12.384
I don't have a congregation,
I have friends and family

03:12.385 --> 03:13.610
who I was worried sick about

03:13.611 --> 03:15.746
after a maniac bombed our hometown.

03:15.747 --> 03:17.848
I'm sorry.

03:17.849 --> 03:19.449
But you still should've told me.

03:19.450 --> 03:20.811
Should I disclose the money I gave

03:20.812 --> 03:22.035
my dad's Catholic church, too?

03:22.036 --> 03:23.987
If a member of its
congregation sets off a bomb

03:23.988 --> 03:25.789
in the United States, you bet.

03:25.790 --> 03:26.890
Next time.

03:26.891 --> 03:28.525
We're late for the staff meeting.

03:28.526 --> 03:29.583
Lead on.

03:30.220 --> 03:32.429
And confirmations are in
for your Global Development

03:32.430 --> 03:34.531
meeting in Montreal.
So far you're meeting

03:34.532 --> 03:36.400
with chef Jamie Oliver, to discuss

03:36.401 --> 03:38.068
global children's nutrition,

03:38.069 --> 03:40.237
the Saudi Foreign Minister Kasib Hajar,

03:40.238 --> 03:42.372
exploring the future of solar power,

03:42.373 --> 03:46.575
and George Clooney, to
stare deeply into his eyes.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.179
And talk mass genocide.

03:51.149 --> 03:52.582
Madam Secretary?

03:52.583 --> 03:54.718
Well, how is taking a
selfie with George Clooney

03:54.719 --> 03:57.087
going to assure Americans they're safe?

03:57.088 --> 03:58.659
Ma'am...

03:59.037 --> 04:00.691
Nobody's missed me at this conference

04:00.692 --> 04:01.892
for the past two years.

04:01.893 --> 04:03.994
Sorry for being late.

04:03.995 --> 04:06.229
It's quite all right. You doing okay?

04:06.230 --> 04:08.799
Fine. I got waylaid
writing your bombing remarks,

04:08.800 --> 04:10.334
but they're almost done.

04:10.335 --> 04:13.403
Do you think that you're the
right person to write those?

04:13.404 --> 04:15.237
Why wouldn't I be?

04:16.940 --> 04:19.843
Because there was a bombing
in your hometown, Matt.

04:19.844 --> 04:23.413
...thank you, ma'am,
but I-I really am okay.

04:23.414 --> 04:24.568
Well, I think

04:24.569 --> 04:26.554
the statement should
address the issue at hand.

04:26.555 --> 04:27.437
What issue?

04:27.438 --> 04:29.920
That there's a Muslim American working

04:29.921 --> 04:31.855
on the seventh floor
of the State Department?

04:31.856 --> 04:32.555
No.

04:32.556 --> 04:34.558
It's his affiliation
with the same mosque

04:34.559 --> 04:36.960
- that the bomber attended.
- She said no, dude.

04:36.961 --> 04:39.029
- Don't "dude" me.
- Okay, you know what?

04:39.030 --> 04:43.033
Let's give this issue a
chance to settle down, okay?

04:43.034 --> 04:44.267
In the meantime,

04:44.268 --> 04:47.404
Daisy, tell me that the
optics of me going to Montreal

04:47.405 --> 04:51.108
instead of standing by my
fellow Americans in D.C.

04:51.109 --> 04:53.243
- are terrible.
- But they're not.

04:53.244 --> 04:54.725
I mean, honestly, I'd be more worried

04:54.726 --> 04:56.429
about offending the
Saudi Foreign Minister.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.948
The bombing investigation's

04:57.949 --> 04:59.149
with the FBI, ma'am.

04:59.150 --> 05:01.118
There's nothing any
of us can do right now.

05:01.119 --> 05:02.185
All right.

05:02.186 --> 05:04.454
Jay, dust off

05:04.455 --> 05:07.691
every brilliant but underfunded
solution to global blight

05:07.692 --> 05:09.059
that State has ever had.

05:09.060 --> 05:10.127
If I'm going to be

05:10.128 --> 05:12.329
sipping champagne with Bill Gates,

05:12.330 --> 05:15.132
I want ten great ideas that
I can convince him were his.

05:15.133 --> 05:16.600
You got it.

05:16.601 --> 05:18.135
- Matt?
- Yeah?

05:18.136 --> 05:19.202
Got a minute?

05:19.203 --> 05:20.771
Sure.

05:20.772 --> 05:23.273
I don't need to take the day off.

05:23.274 --> 05:24.941
Okay.

05:24.942 --> 05:26.810
I didn't realize I'd offered.

05:26.811 --> 05:28.645
Then what is this? The
big "How are you doing?

05:28.646 --> 05:30.247
Is there anything I can help with" talk?

05:30.248 --> 05:31.515
More the

05:31.516 --> 05:34.483
"I just want you to know
that I'm on your side" talk.

05:35.819 --> 05:38.355
But, you know, those other things, too.

05:38.356 --> 05:40.290
I'm sorry.

05:40.291 --> 05:43.427
I'm just... worried about my mom.

05:43.428 --> 05:45.091
- Have you heard from her?
- We've talked.

05:45.092 --> 05:48.432
She's, volunteering
at the mosque now,

05:48.433 --> 05:50.500
which is a scary thought today.

05:50.501 --> 05:52.269
Or tomorrow.

05:52.270 --> 05:54.304
Media scrutiny over this donation

05:54.305 --> 05:56.807
will blow over with the next news cycle.

05:56.808 --> 05:57.941
In an election year?

05:57.942 --> 06:01.378
Anyone of substance
will dismiss the story.

06:01.379 --> 06:04.179
And what about the rest of the country?

06:05.949 --> 06:09.686
Let's just wait and see.

06:09.687 --> 06:11.321
Would you like the day off?

06:11.322 --> 06:12.689
See?

06:12.690 --> 06:16.693
I knew you dragged me in here
to be all kind and considerate.

06:16.694 --> 06:18.261
Honestly,

06:18.262 --> 06:20.030
I'd rather stay busy.

06:20.031 --> 06:23.365
Then get back to work.

06:26.403 --> 06:28.805
Details now emerging in this morning's

06:28.806 --> 06:32.309
suicide bombing in an
Elmhurst, Illinois coffee shop.

06:32.310 --> 06:34.678
Authorities confirm 21 dead,

06:34.679 --> 06:36.313
including the bomber, Atif Al-Mutaya,

06:36.314 --> 06:40.050
a native-born American
citizen of Lebanese decent.

06:40.051 --> 06:41.151
Local to the area.

06:41.152 --> 06:42.252
Here's a box of cords I have,

06:42.253 --> 06:43.653
maybe something in here will work.

06:43.654 --> 06:45.989
...FBI found a handwritten
note pledging loyalty to ISIS.

06:45.990 --> 06:48.058
Yeah, thanks but
these aren't gonna,

06:48.059 --> 06:49.593
restore your Wi-Fi connectivity.

06:49.594 --> 06:51.528
...or how the bomber was radicalized...

06:51.529 --> 06:53.997
Okay, what will?

06:53.998 --> 06:57.033
Well, I set up a wired network
connection to test your modem,

06:57.034 --> 06:58.835
checked for the valid IP address,

06:58.836 --> 07:00.437
and then reset the network circuit.

07:00.438 --> 07:01.936
I don't need to hear your TED talk,

07:01.937 --> 07:04.541
I just need the thing to
play more than four channels.

07:04.542 --> 07:08.345
- Maybe a wireless repeater.
- A what?

07:08.346 --> 07:10.209
I just want to press a
button and make it work.

07:10.210 --> 07:11.181
I'm trying to explain...

07:11.182 --> 07:13.372
I don't want an explanation.
I want a solution.

07:13.373 --> 07:15.385
You can get a repeater
at any electronics store.

07:15.386 --> 07:19.222
So I need to get a new piece of
equipment, which you don't have.

07:19.223 --> 07:20.545
Can't you do anything?
I really love this.

07:20.546 --> 07:22.309
...was a lone-wolf attack,
and not part of a larger

07:22.310 --> 07:24.710
- If I'm supposed to just do it myself,
- coordinated strike,

07:24.711 --> 07:25.774
why do they even send you?

07:25.775 --> 07:29.485
but they stress...

07:33.570 --> 07:35.772
Our government

07:35.773 --> 07:37.707
has an ethical duty to
hit those responsible

07:37.708 --> 07:39.976
for the bombing hard.
The question is how?

07:39.977 --> 07:42.312
We've targeted strategic
ISIS positions for years.

07:42.313 --> 07:44.426
Maybe it's time to
clean house once and for all.

07:44.427 --> 07:45.815
But you mean kill civilians.

07:45.816 --> 07:47.758
Aren't we then guilty of using
non-combatants as a means,

07:47.759 --> 07:48.632
rather than an end?

07:48.633 --> 07:50.120
That's an interesting point.

07:50.121 --> 07:51.154
But I'm not sure

07:51.155 --> 07:52.355
that Kant would agree with

07:52.356 --> 07:54.491
your take on the categorical imperative.

07:54.492 --> 07:56.426
Okay, that's enough for today.

07:56.427 --> 07:58.628
As always, please submit
your response papers online

07:58.629 --> 08:00.730
before the end of week so
I don't do anything crazy

08:00.731 --> 08:03.465
like make plans for the weekend.

08:10.774 --> 08:12.475
Dr. Henry McCord?

08:12.476 --> 08:14.210
Special Agent Paul Ross, FBI.

08:14.211 --> 08:16.446
- May I have a word?
- Regarding?

08:16.447 --> 08:20.482
I'm the case officer for your
former asset, Dmitri Petrov.

08:23.753 --> 08:24.988
What's the charge?

08:24.989 --> 08:27.190
Malicious destruction of property.

08:27.191 --> 08:29.459
A Class 6 felony in Arizona.

08:29.460 --> 08:31.461
A year in jail, minimum.

08:31.462 --> 08:32.962
And what sparked it?

08:32.964 --> 08:34.067
Besides being overqualified

08:34.068 --> 08:35.966
for a job he's clearly not crazy about.

08:35.967 --> 08:37.801
That or anything else.

08:37.802 --> 08:41.905
It's safe to say that his
transition isn't going smoothly.

08:41.905 --> 08:44.608
I need your help.

08:44.609 --> 08:47.243
I haven't seen or spoken
to Dmitri in six months.

08:47.244 --> 08:49.365
That's protocol, I don't
know what you think I can do.

08:49.366 --> 08:50.833
Well, I figured if you
got to know him pretty well

08:50.834 --> 08:52.248
when he was your asset,

08:52.249 --> 08:54.392
I was hoping you might be
able to give me some insight

08:54.393 --> 08:56.686
in what could be causing him to act out.

08:56.687 --> 08:58.722
You mean besides
living in a strange city

08:58.723 --> 09:01.091
under a new identity, and
being completely isolated

09:01.092 --> 09:02.626
from everyone in his former life?

09:02.627 --> 09:04.694
And I'm assuming that
includes his sister, Talia.

09:04.695 --> 09:06.029
He hasn't seen or had contact

09:06.030 --> 09:07.931
with Talia in two years.

09:07.932 --> 09:09.232
She's still in Moscow.

09:09.233 --> 09:11.267
Still believing that
her only living relative

09:11.268 --> 09:13.503
was tortured to death by the GRU.

09:13.504 --> 09:15.438
He knows that she's
alive, but he can't see her

09:15.439 --> 09:16.840
or speak to her ever again.

09:16.841 --> 09:18.842
I... it's a lot.

09:18.843 --> 09:20.276
It's no wonder he's struggling.

09:20.277 --> 09:24.414
Yeah, the, the
loneliness is getting to him.

09:24.415 --> 09:26.416
This isn't an isolated incident.

09:26.417 --> 09:29.352
Dr. McCord, I'm afraid he's
about to blow his cover,

09:29.353 --> 09:32.122
in which case he becomes
a liability to himself

09:32.123 --> 09:33.690
and the country.

09:33.691 --> 09:36.793
It's a Hail Mary, but I
thought maybe seeing you,

09:36.794 --> 09:39.929
a familiar face, someone
with whom he has history,

09:39.930 --> 09:41.731
might help.

09:41.732 --> 09:43.633
It's a complicated history.

09:43.634 --> 09:45.235
Well, like I said,

09:45.236 --> 09:48.103
it's a Hail Mary.

09:48.882 --> 09:49.706
I just think

09:49.707 --> 09:52.011
colleges would love to hear
about something unique to you.

09:52.012 --> 09:54.744
You mean unique to Mom and you.

09:54.745 --> 09:55.845
Hey, it's your life, too.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.514
You can either learn
to embrace it or not.

09:57.515 --> 10:00.016
I vote for embracing it.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.785
- Hi, Mom.
- Noodle.

10:01.786 --> 10:03.453
Don't go away to college.

10:03.454 --> 10:05.288
Stay home and work at the yogurt shop.

10:05.289 --> 10:06.856
Okay, this is freaking me out more

10:06.857 --> 10:08.091
than the terrorist bombing.

10:08.092 --> 10:10.860
Come on, Stevie's gonna
be moving out soon.

10:10.861 --> 10:13.129
You can't leave me alone
with all these boys.

10:13.130 --> 10:14.931
I haven't even gotten in yet.

10:14.932 --> 10:16.433
Not that I will on my own merit.

10:16.434 --> 10:19.202
We were just brainstorming
college essay topics.

10:19.203 --> 10:22.238
The prompt is, "Write about a
significant event in your life""

10:22.239 --> 10:24.574
I want to write about something I did,

10:24.575 --> 10:27.877
not something that happened to
me while I stood in your shadow.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.279
Of course not.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.715
Write about one of your own interests.

10:31.716 --> 10:35.085
Maybe something about fashion

10:35.086 --> 10:36.352
or design.

10:36.353 --> 10:37.854
My God.

10:37.855 --> 10:39.089
It's right in front of me.

10:39.090 --> 10:41.291
I'll write about the time

10:41.292 --> 10:45.662
my makeup tutorial got
250,000 hits on YouTube.

10:45.663 --> 10:47.197
You could totally expand on that.

10:47.198 --> 10:48.198
That's an idea.

10:48.199 --> 10:49.799
That could go in so many directions.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.569
Okay, this is good, I feel better.

10:52.570 --> 10:55.438
I'll start an outline and
I'll have a draft for you guys

10:55.439 --> 10:57.873
before Dad gets back from
his conference in Phoenix.

10:59.743 --> 11:02.479
Hey, look, if her essay really stinks,

11:02.480 --> 11:04.581
it's her guidance counselor's
job to tell her, right?

11:04.582 --> 11:08.218
We're not touching that one.

11:08.219 --> 11:10.754
So Phoenix... you're really going?

11:10.755 --> 11:13.223
Yeah, if Dmitri's cover's blown,

11:13.224 --> 11:15.413
it could cause a lot of
problems, not just for him.

11:15.414 --> 11:17.560
You know, don't-don't
take this the wrong way,

11:17.561 --> 11:19.496
but I just, I can't really believe

11:19.497 --> 11:23.133
that with all the people
that the FBI and the DIA have

11:23.134 --> 11:25.502
at their disposal, the only one

11:25.503 --> 11:28.004
who can handle this job is you.

11:28.005 --> 11:30.140
- Is there a right way to take that?
- Yes.

11:30.141 --> 11:33.877
I need you... here, now.

11:33.878 --> 11:37.347
Our daughter is about to
write her life-defining essay

11:37.348 --> 11:38.648
on eye shadow.

11:38.649 --> 11:40.617
You can't, you can't just leave me alone

11:40.618 --> 11:43.286
with college and the State Department.

11:43.287 --> 11:44.654
State Department? How could I...

11:44.655 --> 11:45.722
You know what, by the way,

11:45.723 --> 11:47.423
I am really mad at you.

11:47.424 --> 11:49.526
- You're mad at me?
- Yes, for not getting this.

11:49.527 --> 11:50.994
For making me spell it out.

11:50.995 --> 11:52.195
You know, you, with all your

11:52.196 --> 11:54.798
heightened-intelligence
skill and all that.

11:54.799 --> 11:56.833
- Really.
- Are you finished?

11:56.834 --> 11:58.568
And you don't need to go all the way

11:58.569 --> 12:00.570
to Arizona for a hug.

12:00.571 --> 12:01.970
Now I'm done.

12:04.375 --> 12:05.608
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

12:05.609 --> 12:07.477
Good morning, ma'am.

12:07.478 --> 12:10.980
This looks like more on
the bombing in Illinois.

12:10.981 --> 12:12.048
Yes, ma'am.

12:12.049 --> 12:13.750
Because of Matt's connection,

12:13.751 --> 12:16.319
I've asked the FBI to
liaise with me directly.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.520
It turns out Atif Al-Mutaya

12:17.521 --> 12:19.155
wasn't just sightseeing in Mecca.

12:19.156 --> 12:21.958
He studied bomb-making
at an ISIS-affiliated

12:21.959 --> 12:23.660
madrassa near there.

12:23.661 --> 12:28.198
Please tell me that the mosque
Matt goes to isn't implicated.

12:28.199 --> 12:30.233
Their role in the
bomber's radicalization

12:30.234 --> 12:31.334
is still unclear.

12:31.335 --> 12:34.637
But the Saudi government's is not.

12:34.638 --> 12:37.574
The FBI found out who funds the madrassa

12:37.575 --> 12:40.276
that gave Al-Mutaya the training,

12:40.277 --> 12:43.546
the material support, and inspiration

12:43.547 --> 12:45.381
to carry out his attack.

12:45.382 --> 12:47.450
It's an humanitarian NGO

12:47.451 --> 12:50.420
whose top donor is Majeed Amjad.

12:50.421 --> 12:52.488
That name isn't familiar.

12:52.489 --> 12:53.752
He's a top advisor to the Saudi

12:53.753 --> 12:55.091
Minister of Education.

12:55.092 --> 12:56.835
High in the government
of our most important

12:56.836 --> 12:58.194
oil provider, arms customer,

12:58.195 --> 12:59.596
and ally in the Gulf.

12:59.597 --> 13:03.867
Technically, Amjad is not
a member of the government,

13:03.868 --> 13:05.935
but the minister does not
make a move without him.

13:05.936 --> 13:07.270
Apart from his nationality,

13:07.271 --> 13:10.173
which makes Majeed Amjad untouchable,

13:10.174 --> 13:12.876
the fact that his cousin
is the foreign minister

13:12.877 --> 13:14.310
makes him uranium.

13:14.311 --> 13:15.979
How solid it this information?

13:15.980 --> 13:18.513
You could chip a tooth on it.

13:20.750 --> 13:23.486
Last year, the Saudi government
skirted its connection

13:23.487 --> 13:25.220
to the dirty bomb.

13:27.090 --> 13:28.992
I'm not letting this one slide.

13:28.993 --> 13:30.960
Not this time.

13:30.961 --> 13:32.362
Good morning, Madam Secretary.

13:32.363 --> 13:34.230
Coffee?

13:34.231 --> 13:37.100
What I really need is
the Saudi ambassador.

13:37.101 --> 13:38.567
Now!

13:40.336 --> 13:43.172
Alexander, Mironov, you're free to go.

13:44.708 --> 13:47.877
Who posted bail?

13:47.878 --> 13:49.478
Your fairy godmother.

13:55.985 --> 13:57.986
Alexander.

14:09.273 --> 14:12.807
Ma'am, Prince Asim, the
Saudi ambassador, is here.

14:12.808 --> 14:14.858
Show him in.

14:19.247 --> 14:21.949
Madam Secretary, the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia

14:21.950 --> 14:23.818
strongly rejects the allegations

14:23.819 --> 14:25.902
your government leveled
against Majeed Amjad.

14:25.903 --> 14:27.722
I have a direct line from Amjad

14:27.723 --> 14:29.657
to 21 dead Americans.

14:29.658 --> 14:31.926
You give me one good reason why

14:31.927 --> 14:33.995
I shouldn't put Saudi Arabia on the List

14:33.996 --> 14:35.730
of State Sponsors of Terrorism.

14:35.731 --> 14:37.656
You're threatening to
cease trading arms to us?

14:37.657 --> 14:38.266
Yes.

14:38.267 --> 14:40.068
And cripple your military

14:40.069 --> 14:43.037
unless you bring
Majeed Amjad to justice.

14:43.038 --> 14:45.606
Madam Secretary, my country is a proven

14:45.607 --> 14:47.375
and rigorous counter-terrorism ally

14:47.376 --> 14:49.711
that provided, among other things,

14:49.712 --> 14:51.579
crucial information that brought

14:51.580 --> 14:53.581
Hizb Al-Shahid's leader to justice.

14:53.582 --> 14:56.551
And yet, Wahhabists
wield a strong influence

14:56.552 --> 14:58.753
in your government and inspire

14:58.754 --> 15:00.888
ISIS fighters throughout the Gulf

15:00.889 --> 15:05.126
to marginalize your Shia
minority and attack the West.

15:05.127 --> 15:07.762
If that is really what you
and President Dalton think...

15:07.763 --> 15:09.897
No, those are facts.

15:09.898 --> 15:11.599
Then I only have to wait a month

15:11.600 --> 15:13.835
to meet our next dance partner.

15:15.471 --> 15:18.372
you mean Fred Reynolds,
who wants to turn away

15:18.373 --> 15:20.141
from the international community?

15:20.142 --> 15:24.011
Or-or Sam Evans, who bears a strong

15:24.012 --> 15:26.681
distrust of the entire Middle East?

15:26.682 --> 15:30.451
Believe me, compared to the
other presidential candidates,

15:30.452 --> 15:32.086
we're the best date in town.

15:32.087 --> 15:34.288
Both you and I know

15:34.289 --> 15:35.857
your boldness is misplaced.

15:35.858 --> 15:39.060
Hardly. The U.S. is moving away

15:39.061 --> 15:42.063
from being a net importer of
oil to being a net exporter.

15:42.064 --> 15:44.966
Until then, we provide most of the oil

15:44.967 --> 15:47.301
to your biggest trade partners in Asia.

15:47.302 --> 15:49.971
Or we could stop.

15:49.972 --> 15:55.243
And risk losing those
customers to us forever?

15:55.244 --> 15:57.712
I mean, you'd really shoot your economy

15:57.713 --> 16:00.214
in the foot over one consultant?

16:00.215 --> 16:02.118
You'd really destroy the
U.S.-Saudi relationship

16:02.119 --> 16:04.218
and send the American
economy into a tailspin

16:04.219 --> 16:06.253
right before an election?

16:08.589 --> 16:11.359
But, as a formality,

16:11.360 --> 16:13.194
I will bring your request to the king.

16:13.195 --> 16:16.296
It's the least I can
do for an old friend.

16:17.865 --> 16:20.412
Presidential hopefuls Governor Sam Evans

16:20.413 --> 16:21.669
and Senator Fred Reynolds

16:21.670 --> 16:22.970
are clamoring for action

16:22.971 --> 16:24.939
from the Dalton administration today.

16:24.940 --> 16:25.973
This Matt Mahoney story

16:25.974 --> 16:27.494
just keeps getting bigger, doesn't it?

16:27.495 --> 16:29.495
Well, it wouldn't be an
election year if it didn't.

16:29.519 --> 16:31.172
- Let's take a look.
- Senator Reynolds!

16:31.173 --> 16:32.507
What do you make of
the allegations leveled

16:32.508 --> 16:34.282
against Secretary
McCord's speech writer?

16:34.283 --> 16:36.184
I'm more interested in hearing from him.

16:36.185 --> 16:38.953
His silence is an insult
to the victims' families.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.488
If I were Dalton, I'd make him talk.

16:40.489 --> 16:44.425
Matt Mahoney has the highest
security clearance in the land.

16:44.426 --> 16:47.428
Yet does not feel the
need to deny his ties

16:47.429 --> 16:48.629
to the Illinois bomber.

16:48.630 --> 16:50.998
It's very interesting that a Muslim

16:50.999 --> 16:55.069
under FBI investigation
gets to keep his mouth shut,

16:55.070 --> 16:58.039
keep his job, and keep
endangering our safety.

16:59.074 --> 17:01.275
I call on Dalton to suspend him

17:01.276 --> 17:03.211
until we know what's going on.

17:03.212 --> 17:05.079
I want to know what's going on.

17:05.079 --> 17:06.580
What's going on?

17:06.582 --> 17:08.648
What's going on?

17:08.650 --> 17:11.319
What's going on? What's going on?

17:11.319 --> 17:14.387
So how should Dalton
handle Matt Mahoney?

17:14.388 --> 17:17.198
It's metastasizing. What
are we gonna do about it?

17:17.199 --> 17:18.059
What's going on?

17:18.060 --> 17:20.527
Interesting choice of greeting.

17:20.528 --> 17:22.363
It's the top trending
hashtag, and soon to be

17:22.364 --> 17:23.587
keyed into the side of my car.

17:23.588 --> 17:25.266
I figured I'm make it work for me.

17:25.267 --> 17:28.768
Okay, I'm gonna go.

17:29.937 --> 17:31.205
What's she worried about now?

17:31.206 --> 17:32.540
Everything.

17:32.541 --> 17:35.576
Always.

17:35.577 --> 17:38.012
How was your interview with the FBI?

17:38.013 --> 17:39.680
Fine, in and out in a half an hour.

17:39.681 --> 17:42.283
I'm actually here to talk
to you about something else.

17:42.284 --> 17:45.419
Do you know why Russell Jackson
called me into his office?

17:45.420 --> 17:47.855
I was not informed of this meeting.

17:47.856 --> 17:49.590
I knew it. He's firing me.

17:49.591 --> 17:50.625
That's impossible.

17:50.626 --> 17:52.526
We're a few weeks out from the election,

17:52.527 --> 17:53.561
and it's neck and neck

17:53.562 --> 17:55.162
If it gives Dalton a spike in the polls,

17:55.186 --> 17:56.731
Russell will not hesitate to gut me.

17:56.732 --> 17:58.566
The accusations are groundless.

17:58.567 --> 18:00.001
That man is many things,

18:00.002 --> 18:03.037
but reactionary is not one of them.

18:03.038 --> 18:06.073
Besides, State's not his jurisdiction.

18:06.074 --> 18:09.243
If anyone's gonna fire you,
it'll be the secretary...

18:09.244 --> 18:10.611
or me.

18:10.612 --> 18:12.079
Thanks.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.880
I find that oddly comforting.

18:16.083 --> 18:18.286
Okay, Alexander Mironov, you're all set.

18:18.287 --> 18:19.820
Your court date is next month.

18:19.821 --> 18:22.990
I found some legal aid
who'll represent you pro Bono.

18:22.991 --> 18:24.659
I will pay you back for bail.

18:24.660 --> 18:25.726
That's not necessary.

18:25.727 --> 18:27.627
I don't want to owe you anything.

18:30.631 --> 18:32.466
Now I'm kicking television screens,

18:32.467 --> 18:34.602
so they sent you to find out why?

18:34.603 --> 18:38.806
I have a hunch it's more
than just feeling isolated.

18:38.807 --> 18:40.975
And your visit's supposed to cure me.

18:40.976 --> 18:43.843
Come on, I'm here as a friend.

18:48.950 --> 18:52.219
I was a captain in the Russian army.

18:52.220 --> 18:55.323
A systems analyst with a
masters in political science.

18:55.324 --> 18:58.592
I had my sister, Talia, real friends.

18:58.593 --> 19:00.328
I had a community in Russia

19:00.329 --> 19:01.662
and in Washington.

19:01.663 --> 19:04.966
I had a place in the
world, a path forward.

19:04.967 --> 19:06.968
I can't imagine how hard
all this has been on you.

19:06.969 --> 19:10.603
You're right, you can't.

19:11.605 --> 19:14.709
A-A woman tried to flirt
with me the other night

19:14.710 --> 19:17.745
at a bar, and for a second I-I
felt something real between us.

19:17.746 --> 19:19.747
And then she asked me where I was from,

19:19.748 --> 19:21.205
and I had to start giving her

19:21.206 --> 19:23.050
Alexander Mironov's made-up history.

19:23.051 --> 19:24.474
You know, I ju... I couldn't do it.

19:24.475 --> 19:26.320
I just... That's what
the last six months

19:26.321 --> 19:27.822
has been like for me.

19:27.823 --> 19:30.358
You know, what's the point?

19:30.359 --> 19:33.027
Listen, just because
you have a cover story

19:33.028 --> 19:34.395
doesn't diminish who you are.

19:34.396 --> 19:36.197
So what? The world gets more dangerous,

19:36.198 --> 19:38.599
and all I can do is watch it on TV.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.068
The bombing... the
woman who pressed charges

19:41.069 --> 19:42.612
said you were watching coverage of it.

19:42.613 --> 19:44.446
Is that what set you off?

19:45.306 --> 19:46.907
Look, if I came to you and I said that,

19:46.908 --> 19:49.143
that you had to stop helping the world,

19:49.144 --> 19:51.479
how would you react?

19:51.480 --> 19:53.481
Take me back with you.

19:53.482 --> 19:55.115
To D.C.

19:56.650 --> 19:58.686
With my knowledge of the Russian army

19:58.687 --> 20:00.454
and my expertise in computers,

20:00.455 --> 20:02.323
I-I can be valuable. I can help.

20:02.324 --> 20:03.958
Please. Without this,

20:03.959 --> 20:07.527
I don't know what I
have left to live for.

20:13.667 --> 20:15.102
What's this?

20:15.103 --> 20:16.837
You need backup?

20:16.838 --> 20:19.373
I didn't bring her. She met me.

20:19.374 --> 20:22.243
I act then the White
House imposes its will

20:22.244 --> 20:23.643
on my department.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.713
I want you to write a speech.

20:28.082 --> 20:30.651
That's it?

20:30.652 --> 20:32.753
Wait, is it, is it for the president?

20:32.754 --> 20:33.754
You wish.

20:33.755 --> 20:35.656
You'll deliver it.

20:35.657 --> 20:38.626
A public statement personally condemning

20:38.627 --> 20:42.096
radical Islam and this latest
sickening act of terror.

20:42.097 --> 20:43.570
Get out in front of the cameras,

20:43.571 --> 20:46.233
say your piece, and this goes away.

20:46.234 --> 20:48.602
It's that simple.

20:48.603 --> 20:51.172
No.

20:51.173 --> 20:53.207
No?

20:53.208 --> 20:55.141
No to what?

20:57.078 --> 20:59.747
I'm offering you a chance to put down

20:59.748 --> 21:01.382
this offensive donation story

21:01.383 --> 21:02.683
once and for all.

21:02.684 --> 21:05.886
Hell, you could even move
some people in the process.

21:05.887 --> 21:10.758
You are uniquely qualified
to speak on behalf of a people

21:10.759 --> 21:13.194
who don't get much
of a voice these days.

21:13.195 --> 21:15.296
And, yeah, does it serve the president?

21:15.297 --> 21:18.165
You bet your ass it does, but
it also serves your country.

21:18.166 --> 21:20.968
You, of all people, should get this.

21:20.969 --> 21:23.871
The fear mongers won't
be any more convinced

21:23.872 --> 21:25.339
whether I say something or not.

21:25.340 --> 21:27.141
Well, then, make a statement, man.

21:27.142 --> 21:29.810
If not for them, for
you, for your people.

21:29.811 --> 21:31.711
For the sanity of this country.

21:32.847 --> 21:34.180
Nadine, help me out here.

21:35.416 --> 21:37.850
Mr. Mahoney has a point.

21:41.555 --> 21:43.357
Do you two...

21:43.358 --> 21:46.827
comprehend the mountains I have to move

21:46.828 --> 21:48.729
between now and November?!

21:48.730 --> 21:50.698
Not to mention,
investigating and preventing

21:50.699 --> 21:54.301
actual terrorists from
slaughtering Americans

21:54.302 --> 21:55.402
at home, where they work

21:55.403 --> 21:57.238
and play.

21:57.239 --> 21:59.273
Do you know what silence looks like?

21:59.274 --> 22:00.641
It looks like support!

22:00.642 --> 22:03.110
Or do you actually support jihadists?

22:03.111 --> 22:05.246
That's what the people
will want to know,

22:05.247 --> 22:07.614
Matthew Asad Mahoney.

22:27.215 --> 22:29.017
Russell, we need to talk.

22:29.018 --> 22:30.452
You know I have

22:30.453 --> 22:32.154
a heart condition.

22:32.155 --> 22:33.388
Better lay off the coffee.

22:33.389 --> 22:35.524
You sound like my wife.

22:35.525 --> 22:37.626
You ignore her calls, too?

22:37.627 --> 22:39.194
I've been busy.

22:39.195 --> 22:41.229
Thanks to your mute speechwriter,

22:41.230 --> 22:42.563
I've become the chum

22:42.564 --> 22:44.166
for the media's feeding frenzy.

22:44.167 --> 22:46.268
Well, part of his
civil liberties include

22:46.269 --> 22:47.703
maintaining his silence.

22:47.704 --> 22:50.172
If you don't bring him to heel now,

22:50.173 --> 22:51.740
Evans'll get elected.

22:51.741 --> 22:53.642
There'll be no civil
liberties left to defend.

22:53.643 --> 22:55.010
Or Reynolds will win

22:55.011 --> 22:57.347
and hit the mute button on
the entire State Department.

22:57.348 --> 22:59.502
How about we stop
persecuting innocent Americans

22:59.503 --> 23:00.482
for the Illinois bombing

23:00.483 --> 23:04.419
when we have the real culprit finally

23:04.420 --> 23:06.888
within our grasp?

23:06.889 --> 23:08.790
King Hani's office

23:08.791 --> 23:10.692
made it quite clear.

23:10.693 --> 23:13.895
Majeed Amjad is nowhere near our grasp.

23:13.896 --> 23:15.190
You spoke with the Saudis?

23:15.191 --> 23:16.575
Well, someone had to reassure them

23:16.576 --> 23:18.600
after you threatened
their national security.

23:18.601 --> 23:21.570
Doesn't Amjad threaten ours?

23:21.571 --> 23:25.040
Look, I'd love to roast
the bastard on a spit,

23:25.041 --> 23:27.843
but not by annihilating
a 70-year alliance.

23:27.844 --> 23:31.046
With one of the main
influencers of outcomes

23:31.047 --> 23:32.247
in Syria and Iraq.

23:32.248 --> 23:33.415
Russell, I know.

23:33.416 --> 23:35.450
Yes, and we both know
there's a better chance

23:35.451 --> 23:39.588
of resolving those
quagmires on Conrad's watch.

23:39.589 --> 23:42.257
How about the chance to leave a legacy

23:42.258 --> 23:44.526
where we stand up to a government that

23:44.527 --> 23:45.894
criminalizes dissent

23:45.895 --> 23:48.230
and-and practices gender apartheid?

23:48.231 --> 23:51.533
A government that
sabotages our security.

23:51.534 --> 23:53.235
Either way, we need four more years

23:53.236 --> 23:55.703
and for that, we need votes.

23:57.339 --> 23:59.841
You're worried about
the number of Americans

23:59.842 --> 24:03.779
who lose manufacturing jobs if
I halt arms sales to the Saudis.

24:03.780 --> 24:06.114
About nine billion in sales.

24:06.115 --> 24:08.617
That's a lot of votes
for Reynolds or Evans.

24:08.618 --> 24:10.552
Listen, I appreciate this doesn't

24:10.553 --> 24:12.888
jive with your new foreign policy.

24:12.889 --> 24:15.757
Our new policy was never

24:15.758 --> 24:17.993
about short-term strategic gains.

24:17.994 --> 24:20.262
We designed it to rock the boat.

24:20.263 --> 24:21.763
We need to take a stand.

24:21.764 --> 24:22.798
You're right...

24:22.799 --> 24:23.999
but not today.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.068
- Just let it slide.
- Russell...

24:26.069 --> 24:28.970
And please, there is no
going to Conrad on this.

24:28.971 --> 24:30.354
He's in the Oval Office right now,

24:30.355 --> 24:32.637
consoling the Illinois
bombing victims' families.

24:32.638 --> 24:33.631
It's not the time.

24:36.879 --> 24:38.779
When will it be the time?

24:40.415 --> 24:42.449
Just not today.

24:54.629 --> 24:56.531
Madam Secretary.

24:56.532 --> 24:58.533
Can I help you, Ms...

24:58.534 --> 25:00.368
Butler. Victoria Butler.

25:00.369 --> 25:01.403
Victoria.

25:01.404 --> 25:02.504
This is Cara.

25:02.505 --> 25:04.473
My daughter. My baby.

25:04.474 --> 25:06.174
Ma'am, please, stay with the group.

25:06.175 --> 25:07.375
It's-it's all right.

25:07.376 --> 25:08.909
Give us a minute, Lucy, will you?

25:16.384 --> 25:17.819
She's my youngest.

25:17.820 --> 25:19.454
My baby.

25:19.455 --> 25:21.989
I'm so very sorry.

25:22.724 --> 25:25.393
It... she had just

25:25.394 --> 25:27.696
gotten her driver's license.

25:27.697 --> 25:29.097
And it-it-it was

25:29.098 --> 25:30.365
the first time she was allowed

25:30.366 --> 25:32.234
to take the car out alone.

25:32.235 --> 25:34.636
I mean, just to get some coffee.

25:34.637 --> 25:35.704
And here I was worried

25:35.705 --> 25:38.372
that she was gonna get into an accident.

25:39.107 --> 25:40.542
But I have been reading

25:40.543 --> 25:43.278
in the news that the FBI

25:43.279 --> 25:46.414
is investigating a Saudi citizen

25:46.415 --> 25:48.683
who's funding the attack?

25:48.684 --> 25:50.418
And they're saying that he's

25:50.419 --> 25:53.021
a government consultant.

25:53.022 --> 25:55.891
Unfortunately, it's true.

25:55.892 --> 25:58.325
Well, what are you doing about it?

25:59.361 --> 26:00.862
When I asked the president,

26:00.863 --> 26:02.697
he said that the guilty parties

26:02.698 --> 26:03.932
would be held accountable,

26:03.933 --> 26:05.567
given that the Saudis have been

26:05.568 --> 26:07.969
linked to attacks in the past

26:07.970 --> 26:10.838
and nothing has been done...

26:13.742 --> 26:16.977
Now that is my little girl.

26:17.679 --> 26:20.248
I want them to pay.

26:20.249 --> 26:22.851
When can that happen, Madam Secretary?

26:22.852 --> 26:24.019
Do you know?

26:24.020 --> 26:26.120
Soon, I hope.

26:28.523 --> 26:30.658
I wish I could be more specific.

26:31.993 --> 26:33.762
And I know that's a useless thing

26:33.763 --> 26:36.030
to say to you right now.

26:53.850 --> 26:55.050
Jay.

26:55.051 --> 26:57.584
Do you have any plans for this evening?

26:58.920 --> 27:02.123
Going home to my wife and child,

27:02.124 --> 27:05.326
whom I love very much.

27:07.162 --> 27:10.065
In your dreams, Whitman.

27:10.066 --> 27:12.567
I'm asking you to go out with Matt.

27:12.568 --> 27:14.336
He's in his office right now,

27:14.337 --> 27:17.272
channeling Ingmar Bergman.

27:17.273 --> 27:21.009
Yeah, he told me about how
he left it with Russell.

27:21.010 --> 27:24.212
Kind of seemed like
he wanted to be alone.

27:24.213 --> 27:25.981
Did he say that to you?

27:25.982 --> 27:27.382
Well, no, but...

27:27.383 --> 27:28.817
See, this is why

27:28.818 --> 27:30.652
male bonding was invented.

27:30.653 --> 27:32.754
To free those bottled feelings,

27:32.755 --> 27:36.958
perhaps over beer or televised sports.

27:36.959 --> 27:41.096
beer, sports and...

27:41.097 --> 27:42.664
feelings.

27:42.665 --> 27:43.632
Thank you.

27:47.269 --> 27:49.738
Is it bad that I made

27:49.739 --> 27:51.940
Blake cancel my trip to Montreal?

27:51.941 --> 27:53.008
I just couldn't face

27:53.009 --> 27:54.910
the Saudi Foreign Minister.

27:54.911 --> 27:56.645
Well, what does Nadine say?

27:56.646 --> 27:57.846
You know...

27:57.847 --> 27:58.847
decorum and all.

27:58.848 --> 27:59.981
She came around.

27:59.982 --> 28:01.750
Honestly, Blake took it harder.

28:01.751 --> 28:03.785
He was looking forward to Lake Como

28:03.786 --> 28:06.888
travel recommendations
from George Clooney.

28:06.889 --> 28:08.857
So, we both killed some dreams today.

28:08.858 --> 28:10.959
Dmitri?

28:10.960 --> 28:13.094
I was afraid to ask.

28:13.095 --> 28:17.265
Okay, tell me if this is crazy,
but is there any possible way

28:17.266 --> 28:19.734
that Dmitri could come back
and work for U.S. Intelligence?

28:19.735 --> 28:20.735
We promised

28:20.736 --> 28:21.903
the Russians we would

28:21.904 --> 28:24.205
never use Dmitri as an asset again.

28:24.206 --> 28:26.174
But even if we went around their back,

28:26.175 --> 28:27.475
it wouldn't take long for GRU

28:27.476 --> 28:28.610
to find out.

28:28.611 --> 28:30.378
Yeah, I pretty much implied that today.

28:30.379 --> 28:33.281
Tell me why we signed
up for these jobs again?

28:33.282 --> 28:35.583
I don't know how I'm
gonna face him tomorrow.

28:35.584 --> 28:38.452
I'm-I'm sorry I can't do more.

28:40.055 --> 28:43.791
I do have one more question
and it's another long shot.

28:44.492 --> 28:45.527
Here you go.

28:45.528 --> 28:46.628
Thanks.

28:46.629 --> 28:47.829
...field goal attempt.

28:47.830 --> 28:48.964
If they can do it...

28:48.965 --> 28:50.165
They're still down?

28:50.166 --> 28:52.033
- Guess I didn't miss much.
- Hi.

28:52.034 --> 28:54.235
This field goal should tie it up.

28:55.338 --> 28:57.305
And the ball is up.

28:57.306 --> 29:00.108
- And it is no good...
- Wow. That was exciting.

29:00.109 --> 29:02.342
Should we call it?

29:03.979 --> 29:04.980
How about another round?

29:04.981 --> 29:06.256
I feel like we haven't...

29:06.257 --> 29:07.882
I feel like we barely talked.

29:07.883 --> 29:09.183
Okay.

29:12.087 --> 29:14.222
My God.

29:14.223 --> 29:16.191
Are you having another baby?

29:16.192 --> 29:17.592
What? No.

29:17.593 --> 29:18.893
No.

29:20.062 --> 29:21.229
I just... I don't know.

29:21.230 --> 29:23.264
I just... I want to see
how you're holding up.

29:23.265 --> 29:25.066
All right?

29:25.067 --> 29:26.267
Fine.

29:26.268 --> 29:27.602
How are you?

29:27.603 --> 29:29.471
Come on, man, don't make me ask twice.

29:32.041 --> 29:33.174
Um...

29:33.175 --> 29:35.910
I know they're after
you to make a statement.

29:35.911 --> 29:38.145
Come on.

29:39.214 --> 29:40.115
Et Tu, Jay.

29:40.116 --> 29:41.383
Et what?

29:41.384 --> 29:43.550
- We're-We're just talking here.
- Right.

29:44.452 --> 29:47.288
You're the, jihadist from the news.

29:47.289 --> 29:48.256
Hey, hey.

29:48.257 --> 29:49.824
- He's not a jihadist.
- Hey, guys,

29:49.825 --> 29:51.960
- we were just leaving, all right?
- No way.

29:51.961 --> 29:53.728
I want to know what's going on.

29:53.729 --> 29:55.430
- Back off?
- Yeah, Mohammed.

29:55.431 --> 29:56.992
- What's going on?
- Hey, hey, hey.

29:56.993 --> 29:58.593
Go back to the frat? You're done.

29:58.594 --> 30:00.033
You're done.

30:13.158 --> 30:14.791
We have ten witnesses who'll say

30:14.792 --> 30:16.860
those guys absolutely started it.

30:16.861 --> 30:18.444
Look, I'm really sorry about the fight,

30:18.445 --> 30:19.663
but I'm not pressing charges.

30:19.664 --> 30:21.865
- You can do whatever you want.
- The guys are regulars.

30:21.866 --> 30:23.926
- The bartender knows their names.
- Just drop it.

30:24.145 --> 30:26.537
My God, what happened?

30:26.538 --> 30:27.538
It's a long story.

30:27.539 --> 30:28.602
What, a sample sale

30:28.603 --> 30:29.573
at Brooks Brothers?

30:29.574 --> 30:30.841
A trio of drunk

30:30.842 --> 30:32.145
Evans' supporters picked a fight

30:32.146 --> 30:33.076
with us last night.

30:33.077 --> 30:34.820
Actually, they picked a fight with me.

30:34.821 --> 30:36.079
Jay defended my honor.

30:36.080 --> 30:37.147
But he won't pursue it,

30:37.148 --> 30:38.892
even though he's the
victim of a hate crime.

30:38.893 --> 30:39.550
My God.

30:39.551 --> 30:40.450
My God,

30:40.451 --> 30:41.552
Jay...

30:41.553 --> 30:43.620
you didn't say it was this bad.

30:43.621 --> 30:46.240
Good news is is it could
have been a lot worse.

30:46.241 --> 30:47.624
Sure, they could've had guns.

30:47.625 --> 30:49.459
But, hey, you know,
thanks for organizing

30:49.460 --> 30:50.661
our man date.

30:50.662 --> 30:53.363
I suggested you get a
beer, not join fight club.

30:53.364 --> 30:54.398
I knew it.

30:54.399 --> 30:55.399
She sent you.

30:55.400 --> 30:56.967
I was just concerned.

30:56.968 --> 30:57.806
Yeah, great.

30:57.807 --> 30:59.069
Thanks for getting me
punched in the face.

30:59.070 --> 31:00.604
Could everybody just move long?

31:00.605 --> 31:01.905
This is my desk.

31:01.906 --> 31:02.940
Right.

31:02.941 --> 31:06.443
Matt, may I speak with you a minute?

31:06.444 --> 31:07.945
I know the last couple of days

31:07.946 --> 31:09.813
have been very, very rough for you

31:09.814 --> 31:11.048
and the investigation is...

31:11.049 --> 31:12.149
Wait, is this another

31:12.150 --> 31:13.584
talk about the statement?

31:13.585 --> 31:15.552
- Seriously?
- A-Actually, yes.

31:15.553 --> 31:17.187
Okay, Nadine, thanks, but,

31:17.188 --> 31:18.571
I can't anymore with the lectures.

31:18.572 --> 31:19.523
Actually...

31:19.524 --> 31:21.358
there's something I want to say to you.

31:21.359 --> 31:24.093
To everyone, act... come with me.

31:25.562 --> 31:28.165
Daisy, Blake, can you
meet me in the conference room?

31:28.166 --> 31:29.132
Daisy, get Jay.

31:29.133 --> 31:30.734
Blake, bring the secretary in.

31:30.735 --> 31:32.035
"Bring her in"?

31:32.036 --> 31:33.870
Like bagels?

31:33.871 --> 31:35.772
Was it somebody's birthday?

31:35.773 --> 31:38.609
I love morning cake.

31:38.610 --> 31:41.010
Whoa, what the hell happened?

31:42.946 --> 31:44.314
I'll tell you later.

31:44.315 --> 31:47.183
Ma'am, may I have your
permission to address the staff?

31:49.753 --> 31:52.021
Sure.

31:55.959 --> 31:57.294
In the last

31:57.295 --> 32:00.697
48 hours, I saw my hometown bombed

32:00.698 --> 32:03.066
and my childhood mosque investigated.

32:03.067 --> 32:04.601
I've been accused

32:04.602 --> 32:07.638
of plotting against my country.

32:07.639 --> 32:11.474
I've been mentally and
physically harassed.

32:12.409 --> 32:15.946
That alone is bad enough.

32:15.947 --> 32:17.147
But the worst thing...

32:17.148 --> 32:19.283
is the grief my own colleagues

32:19.284 --> 32:21.018
and countrymen gave me,

32:21.019 --> 32:23.020
not just about my donation,

32:23.021 --> 32:26.489
but about why I won't
say more to defend myself.

32:27.557 --> 32:29.526
So, here it is.

32:29.527 --> 32:30.894
The big reveal.

32:30.895 --> 32:34.563
The answer to what
you've all been wondering.

32:36.533 --> 32:40.170
Of course, I'm just as
horrified as everyone

32:40.171 --> 32:44.141
that a deranged man
blew up a coffee shop.

32:44.142 --> 32:46.443
I mean, how could
anyone ever doubt that?

32:46.444 --> 32:50.180
But I'm not saying anything
publicly or otherwise,

32:50.181 --> 32:52.182
because I shouldn't have to.

32:52.183 --> 32:55.485
My condemnation should just be a given.

32:55.486 --> 32:58.655
When a white man shoots up a
black church, no one demands

32:58.656 --> 33:01.725
that white men across the
country denounce the attack.

33:01.726 --> 33:02.826
It's understood

33:02.827 --> 33:04.695
that the perpetrator is on the fringe.

33:04.696 --> 33:07.364
That every American decries the tragedy.

33:07.365 --> 33:09.499
But somehow,

33:09.500 --> 33:11.735
when an Islamic extremist
commits an atrocity,

33:11.736 --> 33:14.538
every Muslim is implicated.

33:14.539 --> 33:16.673
All my years of public service,

33:16.674 --> 33:19.976
every ounce of decency I've ever shown

33:19.977 --> 33:21.812
is erased

33:21.813 --> 33:24.513
by other people's fear and revenge.

33:25.515 --> 33:27.951
I mean, do you want to
know what my donation

33:27.952 --> 33:30.820
to the mosque was earmarked for?

33:32.289 --> 33:35.958
A playground for
children of the members.

33:36.827 --> 33:40.296
And do you know what
they unveiled last month?

33:41.031 --> 33:44.967
A playground.

33:52.977 --> 33:55.845
It's true.

33:56.713 --> 34:01.218
The FBI sent over
their report. That's...

34:01.219 --> 34:03.387
why I wanted to have a word with you.

34:03.388 --> 34:05.055
The bomber was radicalized

34:05.056 --> 34:07.457
in Saudi Arabia, not here.

34:07.458 --> 34:10.327
So-so no one at the mosque had
anything to do with the attack.

34:10.328 --> 34:12.728
Absolutely not.

34:12.730 --> 34:15.030
Thank you.

34:18.368 --> 34:21.371
No one should force you to speak.

34:21.371 --> 34:23.973
I'll make sure Russell knows that.

34:26.342 --> 34:28.879
I'm sorry, Matt.

34:28.880 --> 34:31.748
I didn't realize.

34:31.748 --> 34:33.181
Me, neither.

34:35.452 --> 34:38.321
I'm not exactly a
poster child for Allah.

34:38.322 --> 34:41.524
I bury my ethnicity
and religion because...

34:42.726 --> 34:45.360
...I don't want to deal
with the assumptions.

34:46.096 --> 34:48.165
But it's who I am.

34:48.166 --> 34:50.634
I'm tired of denying it.

34:50.635 --> 34:52.469
Now I have an opportunity

34:52.469 --> 34:54.670
to confront that on my own terms.

34:54.672 --> 34:57.274
So... I'm taking the
rest of the week off.

34:57.275 --> 34:58.475
By all means.

34:58.476 --> 35:01.378
I want to take my mom to Friday prayers.

35:01.379 --> 35:04.915
I think she'd like that.

35:04.916 --> 35:06.917
I'd like that.

35:06.918 --> 35:09.585
Ma'am.

35:17.194 --> 35:18.895
Blake, are you ready to get your copy

35:18.896 --> 35:21.597
of Ocean's Eleven signed?

35:22.866 --> 35:25.235
Montreal's back on?

35:34.570 --> 35:37.132
The Saudis were very grateful
to be put back on your schedule.

35:37.133 --> 35:39.299
Yeah, thanks, in no small part,

35:39.300 --> 35:42.202
to the extra media
attention it gets them.

35:42.203 --> 35:44.571
Ma'am, are you sure this is a good idea?

35:44.572 --> 35:47.106
We'll see.

35:48.976 --> 35:50.444
Minister Hajar.

35:50.445 --> 35:51.979
Madam Secretary.

35:51.980 --> 35:53.547
I am glad you changed your mind.

35:53.548 --> 35:55.948
The summit wouldn't have
been the same without you.

35:58.952 --> 36:00.554
There's still much good our countries

36:00.555 --> 36:02.256
can accomplish together.

36:02.257 --> 36:05.426
Perhaps in the realm of solar energy?

36:05.427 --> 36:07.394
I hope this is a sign

36:07.395 --> 36:11.098
that we can leave the past
behind and forge a new road.

36:11.099 --> 36:13.567
I look forward to seeing
where it will lead.

36:13.568 --> 36:16.170
Before we move onto our
important discussions,

36:16.171 --> 36:19.305
I thought I'd add one
more thing to our docket.

36:19.973 --> 36:23.444
Victoria...

36:23.445 --> 36:24.912
Minister Hajar.

36:24.913 --> 36:28.482
My name is Victoria Butler.

36:28.483 --> 36:31.652
My 16-year-old daughter
Cara was murdered

36:31.653 --> 36:35.022
by the bomber who received
funds from your cousin

36:35.023 --> 36:37.391
and consultant to your cabinet,

36:37.392 --> 36:39.393
Majeed Amjad.

36:39.394 --> 36:41.195
Secretary McCord told me

36:41.196 --> 36:43.596
you could help get
justice for my daughter.

36:57.245 --> 36:59.146
Mesa Pizza, how can I help you?

37:01.483 --> 37:04.384
And this is a... a delivery, right?

37:06.054 --> 37:07.120
Take it easy.

37:17.265 --> 37:19.599
- Who is it?
- Alexander Mironov.

37:28.408 --> 37:31.345
Hey, Dmitri.

37:31.346 --> 37:34.515
You remember Special Agent Ross.

37:34.516 --> 37:36.750
Been a while. Thank you for coming.

37:36.751 --> 37:38.519
My release terms force me to come here

37:38.520 --> 37:41.421
for my psychiatrist visits
or I risk going back to jail.

37:41.422 --> 37:42.656
Very clever.

37:42.657 --> 37:45.859
And, probably a good idea since

37:45.860 --> 37:48.295
you're not letting me
back into intelligence.

37:48.296 --> 37:49.930
You're... going without me.

37:49.931 --> 37:52.533
That's right. I couldn't
get you back in. But we will

37:52.534 --> 37:54.067
be able to keep in better touch.

37:54.068 --> 37:55.569
We set up a dead drop number

37:55.570 --> 37:57.337
for your use with Dr. McCord.

37:57.338 --> 37:59.840
For my next phone call from jail.

37:59.841 --> 38:01.108
Come on, Dmitri.

38:01.109 --> 38:04.011
I know things seem hopeless right now.

38:04.012 --> 38:06.914
Honestly, I can't imagine
living like you. Cut off

38:06.915 --> 38:10.250
from my country, my career and
especially my family, but...

38:10.251 --> 38:13.720
Please leave. You're only making
my psychiatrist's job harder.

38:13.721 --> 38:16.223
Look, I can't give you

38:16.224 --> 38:17.791
professional fulfillment.

38:17.792 --> 38:21.227
But I can give you the
chance to find connection.

38:28.669 --> 38:30.604
Talia?

38:30.605 --> 38:32.806
Talia!

38:32.807 --> 38:35.342
Elizabeth worked with immigration

38:35.343 --> 38:37.244
to fast-track Talia
for a temporary visa

38:37.245 --> 38:38.812
to stay in the U.S.

38:38.813 --> 38:41.815
In a few months, it'll be
permanent under a new name,

38:41.816 --> 38:43.315
Dina Mironov.

38:44.084 --> 38:45.519
Her cover is...

38:45.520 --> 38:47.120
well, she's your sister.

38:47.121 --> 38:50.757
You don't have to lie about that.

38:50.758 --> 38:54.126
You're very lucky to have
Dr. McCord in your corner.

39:00.301 --> 39:02.369
That was incredible, ma'am.

39:02.370 --> 39:04.538
I had a hard time
concentrating on solar grids

39:04.539 --> 39:07.374
after watching Minister Hajar
react to Victoria Butler.

39:07.375 --> 39:09.009
We're not done yet.

39:09.010 --> 39:11.044
Engage phase two.

39:11.045 --> 39:12.379
All right, everyone.

39:12.380 --> 39:14.418
Let's get set up for the
secretary's next meeting.

39:14.419 --> 39:16.717
W-With George Clooney.

39:23.591 --> 39:25.892
Never, in the course

39:25.893 --> 39:27.594
of our nations' friendship,

39:27.595 --> 39:28.738
has our country been treated

39:28.739 --> 39:30.530
- with such disrespect.
- Or

39:30.531 --> 39:33.767
been granted such an opportunity
to prove their progressivism.

39:33.768 --> 39:37.070
Your king sent you to this summit

39:37.071 --> 39:40.040
to show the world
Saudi's cooperative side.

39:40.041 --> 39:41.375
And you ambushed me.

39:41.376 --> 39:44.044
I know. I know it looks
that way now, yeah.

39:44.045 --> 39:46.647
But if you were to return home

39:46.648 --> 39:48.548
and prosecute Majeed Amjad,

39:48.549 --> 39:51.551
well, the image of the Saudi official

39:51.552 --> 39:54.488
moved by the grieving American mother

39:54.489 --> 39:57.758
would do wonders for
your king's narrative.

39:57.759 --> 39:59.126
That's a rather cynical way

39:59.127 --> 40:01.094
to get what you want, Madam Secretary.

40:01.095 --> 40:02.629
If you do nothing,

40:02.630 --> 40:04.598
I promise you, I will not rest

40:04.599 --> 40:07.100
until I bring Amjad to justice.

40:07.101 --> 40:09.836
I can't put your country

40:09.837 --> 40:12.272
on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list,

40:12.273 --> 40:14.908
but after the election, win or lose,

40:14.909 --> 40:17.411
I will still be the secretary of state

40:17.412 --> 40:19.212
for at least a couple of months

40:19.213 --> 40:21.181
and I will target Amjad

40:21.182 --> 40:25.919
individually with the harshest
economic and travel sanctions

40:25.920 --> 40:29.623
from not only the U.S. but
also our European allies

40:29.624 --> 40:32.426
who suffer Islamic terror attacks.

40:32.427 --> 40:34.227
As you know,

40:34.228 --> 40:36.163
those sanctions have a...

40:36.164 --> 40:38.932
trickle-down effect,

40:38.933 --> 40:40.867
making any family member

40:40.868 --> 40:43.203
of the sanctioned persona non grata

40:43.204 --> 40:46.038
throughout the West.

40:46.740 --> 40:48.842
Go home and tell your cousin that.

41:00.187 --> 41:02.456
So? Come on,

41:02.457 --> 41:04.191
how is Ali's essay? Be honest.

41:04.192 --> 41:08.128
On a scale of Harvard to
living in our basement.

41:10.264 --> 41:13.233
She's used her YouTube
tutorial as a metaphor

41:13.234 --> 41:15.135
for the democratization of media,

41:15.136 --> 41:16.970
third-wave feminism

41:16.971 --> 41:19.172
and the Internet as virtual university.

41:19.173 --> 41:21.141
W-What?

41:21.142 --> 41:23.510
A-All that in...

41:23.511 --> 41:25.812
500 words or less?

41:25.813 --> 41:26.847
I never knew...

41:26.848 --> 41:29.648
smoky eyes could be so poignant.

41:31.384 --> 41:32.652
It's really good.

41:32.653 --> 41:35.689
And now I'm getting misty-eyed.

41:35.690 --> 41:36.656
You're very cute

41:36.657 --> 41:38.925
when you're overwhelmed by intelligence.

41:38.926 --> 41:41.828
Speaking of, thanks again
for helping with Dmitri.

41:41.829 --> 41:43.130
Of course.

41:43.131 --> 41:45.298
Wait. Hold that thought.

41:45.299 --> 41:48.368
...Hani of Saudi Arabia
placed Majeed Amjad,

41:48.369 --> 41:51.071
a top consultant of his
minister of education,

41:51.072 --> 41:54.274
under arrest tonight for
funding the Illinois bomb attack

41:54.275 --> 41:57.244
carried out by Atif Al-Mutaya.

41:57.245 --> 41:59.279
All this after a moving meeting

41:59.280 --> 42:02.616
at the Global Development
Assembly in Montreal

42:02.617 --> 42:05.585
between the Saudi Foreign

42:05.586 --> 42:06.953
and Victoria Butler,

42:06.954 --> 42:10.590
mother to 16-year-old
bombing victim, Cara Butler.

42:10.591 --> 42:12.993
Think anybody notices my cowlick?

42:12.994 --> 42:15.628
It's, like, waving at the cameras.

42:16.196 --> 42:17.564
Take the win, babe.

42:17.565 --> 42:18.988
...mosque suspected of radicalizing

42:18.989 --> 42:20.767
Al-Mutaya, of any wrongdoing.

42:20.768 --> 42:23.270
Specifically, Matthew A. Mahoney,

42:23.271 --> 42:25.939
Secretary of State Elizabeth
McCord's speechwriter,

42:25.940 --> 42:28.875
whose donation to the
mosque was under scrutiny

42:28.876 --> 42:32.679
by investigators, media outlets
and presidential hopefuls

42:32.680 --> 42:35.816
Sam Evans and Fred Reynolds.

42:39.319 --> 42:41.721
Mr. Mahoney, why are
you here on a Friday?

42:41.722 --> 42:43.824
Are you taking a leave of absence?

42:43.825 --> 42:45.759
What does the secretary
say about your innocence?

42:45.760 --> 42:49.061
Mr. Mahoney, would you
like to make a statement?
