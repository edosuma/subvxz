[Goofy]<i>  "Smarty Goof."</i>

01:02.863 --> 01:05.413
Golly, inventin' stuff
sure is fun.

01:05.449 --> 01:07.107
You said it, Goofy.

01:07.142 --> 01:08.758
-(hose hissing)
-Oh! Uh, get the hose!

01:08.793 --> 01:10.018
Whoa!

01:12.597 --> 01:13.755
Ooh!

01:13.791 --> 01:16.383
That got it. Whew!

01:16.418 --> 01:18.126
So what
are you boys makin'?

01:18.162 --> 01:20.311
Well, we built
a best-buddy invention

01:20.347 --> 01:23.106
for the Hot Dog Hills
Invention Competition.

01:23.141 --> 01:25.208
Yeah.
We made it together.

01:25.243 --> 01:27.244
It's Mick-n-Gooftastic.

01:27.279 --> 01:29.762
Presenting...

01:29.798 --> 01:32.765
[both]
The Morning Getter Upper Car!

01:32.801 --> 01:33.892
-Ooh, nice!
-That's cool.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.588
The Getter Upper is the ultimate
time-saving driving device.

01:37.623 --> 01:39.256
Show 'em, Goofy.

01:39.291 --> 01:40.466
Yep!

01:40.501 --> 01:42.250
(engine starts)

01:42.285 --> 01:43.685
-Go!
-Hey! Wow!

01:43.720 --> 01:47.673
While automatically takin' ya
where you need to go,

01:47.708 --> 01:50.041
the Getter Upper
gives ya a shower.

01:50.077 --> 01:52.769
Brushes yer teeth.

01:52.804 --> 01:53.228
(tires screech)

01:55.324 --> 01:57.274
And it even makes
pancakes with syrup.

01:59.219 --> 02:00.477
(boing)

02:00.512 --> 02:01.778
Gawrsh!

02:03.148 --> 02:04.623
(shower burps)

02:04.658 --> 02:08.043
(chuckling)
Too much syrup.

02:08.078 --> 02:09.752
Oh, I need to fix that.

02:09.788 --> 02:11.296
It's amazing.

02:11.331 --> 02:13.081
How did you dream it up?

02:13.117 --> 02:15.292
[both]
It was teamwork!

02:15.327 --> 02:16.735
<i>  Hello dere!</i>

02:16.770 --> 02:20.739
<i>  Say, fellas, did you all done</i>
<i>  with my Smarty Wrench?</i>

02:20.774 --> 02:22.316
<i>  I gonna need it</i>
<i>  for the invention making</i>

02:22.351 --> 02:24.309
<i>  in my laboratory.</i>

02:24.344 --> 02:25.961
Here it is,
Professor Von Drake.

02:25.996 --> 02:28.104
I'll bring it right down.

02:28.140 --> 02:29.773
(bell dings)

02:29.808 --> 02:31.933
(machinery crackling)

02:31.969 --> 02:34.645
Golly... whatcha makin'?

02:34.680 --> 02:35.896
Wrench, please.

02:38.300 --> 02:42.110
My masterpiece
for the Invention Competition--

02:42.145 --> 02:44.413
the Smarty Hat.

02:44.448 --> 02:47.173
Whosoever puts this
on their little noggin

02:47.209 --> 02:50.885
is gonna become
right away super smart!

02:50.921 --> 02:53.480
Gawrsh!
Can I give it a try?

02:53.515 --> 02:56.157
A Goofy man is
the perfect test subject

02:56.193 --> 02:58.468
-for putting
on my Smarty Hat.
-(squish)

02:58.503 --> 03:01.088
What was that squishy sound
we gettin'?

03:01.123 --> 03:03.148
Syrup. H'yuck!

03:03.183 --> 03:05.425
Whoa! Ow!

03:09.381 --> 03:15.861
Hmm... I am
experiencing an unusual
sensation in my head.

03:15.896 --> 03:21.058
Here I got one doozy-woozy
of a mathematical equation.

03:21.093 --> 03:22.708
Let's see
if you can figure it out.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.220
(chalk clicking on blackboard)

03:25.255 --> 03:27.071
The answer
to this simple equation

03:27.107 --> 03:29.441
is this... and a peanut.

03:29.476 --> 03:31.451
I found the peanut
on the floor.

03:31.486 --> 03:32.544
That is correct!

03:32.579 --> 03:35.789
And I give an extra bonus point
for the peanut, too.

03:35.824 --> 03:37.532
(gulp)

03:37.567 --> 03:38.967
Goofy, how would
you like to help me

03:39.002 --> 03:42.637
demonstrate my Smarty Hat
at the big convention today?

03:42.672 --> 03:45.606
I would find
that agreeable.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.126
<i>  Hey, Goofy,</i>
<i>  we need to get goin'.</i>

03:48.161 --> 03:50.653
<i> A timely observation,</i>
<i> Mickey.</i>

03:50.689 --> 03:53.414
<i>  Uh, Goofy, you sound</i>
<i>  a little different.</i>

03:53.449 --> 03:55.267
<i>  And what's on your head?</i>

03:55.302 --> 03:57.143
The Smarty Hat.

03:57.179 --> 03:59.020
It's the Professor's
invention.

03:59.056 --> 04:00.972
I was helping him test it.

04:01.007 --> 04:03.040
Mr. Smarty Goof,

04:03.076 --> 04:05.477
the Smarty Hat
stays here.

04:05.512 --> 04:06.828
Agreed.

04:06.863 --> 04:08.980
It seems to be stuck!

04:09.015 --> 04:11.140
(crash)

04:11.175 --> 04:13.919
A-hem.
It must be the result

04:13.954 --> 04:16.446
of the adhesive properties
of the syrup.

04:16.481 --> 04:21.818
Oh, I'm gonna need
to whip up a formula
to make it unstuck then.

04:21.853 --> 04:26.147
And I see you over
at the Invention Competition.

04:26.183 --> 04:27.190
-(syrup dripping)
-(wrench creaking)

04:27.225 --> 04:29.259
-Allow me.
-Huh?

04:32.163 --> 04:33.388
(clicks)

04:34.950 --> 04:37.250
Wow! You fixed it!

04:37.285 --> 04:39.827
The Getter Upper
is ready to roll.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.397
The name's rather silly...
(chuckling)

04:42.432 --> 04:44.207
don't you think?

04:44.243 --> 04:48.053
Silly? I think
it's Mick-n-Gooftastic!

04:48.088 --> 04:50.722
But the vehicle needs
a better name.

04:50.757 --> 04:53.641
-(bell dings)
-The Automatic Daily Conveyance.

04:53.676 --> 04:55.718
Well, I like
what we already have.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.829
It's the Getter Upper!
Check it out!

04:57.864 --> 04:58.963
(engine starts)

04:58.999 --> 05:00.289
(sputtering)

05:00.325 --> 05:02.717
It needs one final touch.

05:02.752 --> 05:04.219
(engine runs smoothly)

05:04.254 --> 05:06.955
Now the engine
is more efficient.

05:06.990 --> 05:09.715
That means
it works better.

05:09.751 --> 05:11.118
-But--
-Don't worry.

05:11.153 --> 05:14.763
I'll make the rest
of the improvements
at the competition.

05:14.798 --> 05:16.831
Improvements?

05:16.867 --> 05:18.358
What improvements?!

05:18.393 --> 05:23.004
Greetings, all you brainiacs
from us autofeeliacs.

05:23.039 --> 05:25.340
This is Billy Beagle
reporting live

05:25.375 --> 05:28.827
from the Hot Dog Hills
Invention Competition.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.455
Mayor McBeagle, Clara Cluck,
and I will be judging

05:31.490 --> 05:35.550
who will be the winner
of the Super Inventor's Trophy.

05:35.585 --> 05:39.879
I've rerouted
the flam-jammer and plugged
up the gummy converter.

05:39.914 --> 05:42.023
But it was fine before.

05:42.059 --> 05:44.384
I have to disagree.

05:44.419 --> 05:46.953
These liquid flow-ropes
are not secure,

05:46.988 --> 05:48.621
and the syrup tanks are...

05:48.656 --> 05:49.923
-(thunk)
-Waah!

05:49.958 --> 05:51.449
Oh! Inadequate.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.259
(gurgling)

05:53.295 --> 05:55.487
Oh, no!
We gotta stop the leak!

05:55.522 --> 05:57.997
I am working on it.

05:58.032 --> 06:00.258
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
Mr. Smarty Goof!

06:00.294 --> 06:05.021
I've got some sticky-
syrup-unsticking spray.

06:05.056 --> 06:06.764
Wow-ow-ooo-ooo!

06:06.799 --> 06:08.992
Gawrsh.

06:09.027 --> 06:11.068
I feel
like my old self again!

06:11.104 --> 06:14.523
Ooh ooh!
Goofy! The leak!

06:14.558 --> 06:17.092
Leak? Oh,
I know how to plug it up--

06:17.127 --> 06:18.076
bubble gum!

06:24.250 --> 06:25.875
Great thinking, Goofy.

06:25.910 --> 06:29.270
[Billy on P.A.]<i>  Next up</i>
<i>  to present his invention,</i>

06:29.306 --> 06:31.882
<i>  Professor Ludwig Von Drake!</i>

06:31.917 --> 06:33.266
Come, come, now.

06:33.301 --> 06:36.519
Time to get
this smarty party
started already!

06:36.554 --> 06:38.380
Ya hear that, Mickey?

06:38.415 --> 06:40.322
I'm gonna get
smarty'd up again.

06:40.358 --> 06:43.485
Aw, bein' smart
is okay, Goof.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.878
Just stay
a little goofy, Goofy.

06:45.914 --> 06:48.089
Hello dere, judges.

06:48.124 --> 06:50.149
Allow me
to intro-demonstrate

06:50.185 --> 06:52.844
the Von Drake Smarty Hat!

06:52.879 --> 06:56.907
Whoever wears this
becomes an instant genius
right away.

06:56.942 --> 06:58.116
(crowd "ahhs")

06:58.151 --> 07:02.279
Now, Goofy, I want you to
now invent something fabulous

07:02.314 --> 07:04.906
using only the items
on that table.

07:04.941 --> 07:06.124
Hmm...

07:06.159 --> 07:07.258
Put this here,

07:07.294 --> 07:08.843
and this here,

07:08.879 --> 07:11.037
and, golly!

07:11.072 --> 07:13.131
I made
an automatic scratchy arm.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.808
Bawk?

07:14.843 --> 07:17.677
And now,
with the Smarty Hat on.

07:21.225 --> 07:22.474
(bell dings)

07:25.304 --> 07:28.488
And what
do you call those things?

07:28.523 --> 07:29.931
Extending Grab Hands.

07:29.966 --> 07:31.525
Observe.

07:31.560 --> 07:32.734
(crowd "ohhs")

07:36.247 --> 07:37.847
(applause)

07:37.883 --> 07:39.674
Wow, I love apples!

07:39.710 --> 07:41.801
That Smarty Goof
was really something!

07:41.836 --> 07:42.577
(clucking)

07:51.229 --> 07:52.904
Uh, say, Professor?

07:52.940 --> 07:55.123
Uh, could I, uh...

07:55.158 --> 07:56.842
maybe borrow the Smarty Hat?

07:56.877 --> 07:58.460
Why, certainly.

07:58.495 --> 08:00.695
I just think bein'
a little smarter

08:00.731 --> 08:03.097
might help me and Mickey
with our invention today.

08:04.476 --> 08:07.134
Hiya, Goofy.

08:07.170 --> 08:09.053
Ya don't need to wear
that hat now, do ya?

08:09.089 --> 08:13.742
My increased intellect should
help us win the competition.

08:13.777 --> 08:17.862
And now, Donald Duck
and his Automatic Fishing Belt.

08:20.266 --> 08:21.032
(quacks)

08:27.131 --> 08:29.649
Aw, phooey!

08:29.685 --> 08:31.459
(embarrassed cluck)

08:31.495 --> 08:33.436
Next up, the Happy Helpers

08:33.472 --> 08:35.839
with their groundbreaking
Bow-copters.

08:35.874 --> 08:37.557
[all] Thank you.

08:37.592 --> 08:40.426
All right, girls,
in three, two, one.

08:42.180 --> 08:44.205
Wow! Bow-utiful takeoff!

08:44.240 --> 08:45.740
-Oh, no, look out!
-Aah!

08:45.775 --> 08:47.175
Bad doodles!

08:47.210 --> 08:48.401
Watch where you're goin'!

08:48.436 --> 08:51.796
[Billy] Oh! And that's a wrap
for the Happy Helpers.

08:51.831 --> 08:53.456
Next, it's Mickey and Goofy

08:53.492 --> 08:55.333
with their Morning
Getter Upper Car.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.786
Correction.

08:57.788 --> 08:59.779
It's called
the Automatic
Daily Conveyance.

08:59.814 --> 09:04.751
Uh, pal, I still
think our other
version was just fine.

09:04.786 --> 09:08.345
Oh, no, no, no.
This is much improved.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.948
The Automatic Daily
Conveyance

09:10.984 --> 09:14.135
is the ultimate time-saving
driving device.

09:14.170 --> 09:17.154
It will drive you
wherever you need to go.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.048
(tires screeching)

09:19.083 --> 09:22.485
Whoa. Whoo!
This is goin' a little fast!

09:22.520 --> 09:26.640
[Goofy] And while
on the road, you can
get your exercise.

09:26.675 --> 09:29.059
Hey, hey, hey!

09:29.094 --> 09:34.447
[Goofy] You can also enjoy
a nutritious kale, kelp,
and carp smoothie.

09:34.483 --> 09:36.824
Blech! Whoa!

09:36.859 --> 09:38.059
That was kinda fishy.

09:38.094 --> 09:39.110
Huh?!

09:43.608 --> 09:45.224
Oh, Mickey,
are you all right?

09:45.260 --> 09:47.919
I'm okay,

09:47.921 --> 09:50.780
but that crazy Daily Conveyance
is all messed up.

09:50.815 --> 09:53.633
But I made
lots of improvements.

09:53.668 --> 09:56.585
Yes, but it's
not ours anymore.

09:56.621 --> 09:59.271
We built
the Getter Upper together.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.807
This thing just isn't the same,

10:00.842 --> 10:03.968
and neither are you since you
put on the Smarty Hat.

10:07.733 --> 10:10.283
So you don't want me
to be super-brainy smart?

10:10.318 --> 10:14.304
Aw, pal, you're smarter
whether you wear
the hat or not.

10:14.339 --> 10:15.655
You've always been a goof--

10:15.691 --> 10:17.014
a Smarty Goof!

10:17.049 --> 10:19.525
Gawrsh!

10:19.560 --> 10:21.710
How 'bout we show everyone
our big finish?

10:21.746 --> 10:22.954
Hold on to
your Bunsen burners, folks.

10:22.989 --> 10:23.863
It looks
like Mickey and Goofy

10:23.898 --> 10:27.141
are about to show us
what this baby
can really do!

10:27.177 --> 10:28.935
If you're in a rush

10:28.970 --> 10:30.986
and you don't have time
for breakfast,

10:31.022 --> 10:34.265
just press
the Whirly Twirly
Pancakey Maker.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.500
[Goofy]
Let's fire it up!

10:40.848 --> 10:42.281
(cheering)

10:42.316 --> 10:43.675
Ha ha!
I hope they're hungry!

10:46.596 --> 10:47.995
[Billy] Whoa!
This is amazing, folks!

10:48.030 --> 10:49.455
They're flying and making...

10:49.491 --> 10:50.723
Pancakes!

10:52.093 --> 10:53.059
Wow!

10:54.645 --> 10:56.896
Blueberry!
My favorite!

10:58.908 --> 11:00.800
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:00.835 --> 11:02.752
this is the most fun invention
I've ever seen!

11:02.787 --> 11:04.504
I love it! We love it!

11:04.539 --> 11:06.089
And it's delicious!

11:06.124 --> 11:07.340
(clucking)

11:07.375 --> 11:10.034
Mickey and Goofy win!

11:10.069 --> 11:11.393
-[Minnie] Hooray!
-[Donald] You did it!

11:11.429 --> 11:13.137
And I present to you

11:13.173 --> 11:15.749
the Super Inventor's
Trophy!

11:15.784 --> 11:18.250
(camera clicks)

11:18.286 --> 11:20.028
You know,
in reflection,

11:20.063 --> 11:22.088
those yummy pancakes
could have used some syrup.

11:22.123 --> 11:22.964
(tank hissing)

11:26.019 --> 11:27.443
[Goofy]
Syrup for everyone!

11:27.478 --> 11:28.886
(laughter)

11:32.692 --> 11:34.892
[Minnie]
<i>  "Adventures in Buddysitting!"</i>

11:37.030 --> 11:38.530
Unh! There.

11:38.565 --> 11:41.824
That's all the stuff
from the attic
and closets.

11:41.859 --> 11:44.385
Boy, this junk
really piles up.

11:44.421 --> 11:45.653
Hey! Wait a minute!

11:45.689 --> 11:47.255
You can't give
all our stuff away.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.489
We need these things.

11:48.524 --> 11:51.985
When was the last time
any of us needed clown shoes?

11:52.020 --> 11:54.320
It's always good
to have a spare set.

11:54.355 --> 11:56.747
All right,
the clown shoes stay.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.917
And what about
this old unicycle?

11:58.952 --> 12:00.292
You mean Bo-Bo?!

12:00.328 --> 12:02.962
No, no.
Bo-Bo no go-go.

12:02.997 --> 12:05.147
She's losin' it.

12:05.183 --> 12:06.824
Now, Daisy, it's all
going to charity.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.751
It's a good cause.

12:08.786 --> 12:10.645
Don't listen to 'em, Bo-Bo.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.229
You're more than
an old unicycle.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.932
(phone rings)

12:14.968 --> 12:16.467
Happy Helpers
are here for you.

12:16.502 --> 12:18.727
Minnie speaking.

12:18.763 --> 12:20.263
-(clucks)
-Hi, Clara.

12:20.298 --> 12:23.783
(excited clucking)

12:23.785 --> 12:25.509
The Hot Dog Hills
Play Center
is closed today?

12:25.545 --> 12:28.705
(clucking)

12:28.740 --> 12:30.365
And you need us
to babysit your twins?

12:30.400 --> 12:32.834
Why, certainly.

12:32.869 --> 12:34.143
Just bring your
little chickadees by.

12:34.179 --> 12:36.871
(clucking)

12:36.907 --> 12:38.605
Come on, Daisy,
to the TurnSty--

12:38.641 --> 12:40.541
(clucking)

12:40.577 --> 12:43.277
Oh.
My, that was fast, Clara.

12:43.312 --> 12:45.788
(giggles) We didn't
even change our clothes.

12:45.823 --> 12:47.557
(happy chirping)

12:47.592 --> 12:49.992
Oh, hello, Cleo,
hello, Clifford.

12:50.028 --> 12:51.969
Don't worry, Clara.

12:52.004 --> 12:53.946
We'll take good care
of your little darlings.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.382
(clucking)

12:56.417 --> 12:59.194
So if the Play Center
is closed,

12:59.196 --> 13:01.504
then who's going to watch
all those other kids?

13:01.539 --> 13:05.707
Happy Helpers, this is
a babysitting emergency.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.543
There's no one to watch Elray.

13:07.579 --> 13:09.871
Or Pearl (snort)
and Puck.

13:09.906 --> 13:11.639
Doodles!
That's a lot of kids!

13:11.674 --> 13:14.542
[Elray]
Is that a unicycle?!

13:14.577 --> 13:16.644
Maybe if we ignore 'em,
they'll go away.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.363
Oh, don't be silly.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.172
Of course we'll
watch your children.

13:20.207 --> 13:21.599
(snort) Oh, thank you.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.625
(laughter)

13:25.822 --> 13:26.879
[Puck] Hey, Elray!
Bet you can't catch us!

13:28.432 --> 13:31.733
(sniffing)

13:31.769 --> 13:34.687
Goodbye, Pearl.
Goodbye, Puck.

13:34.722 --> 13:37.348
Have ya got room
for one more?

13:37.384 --> 13:40.468
(giggles) Why, of course.

13:40.503 --> 13:41.769
Uh-oh!

13:43.097 --> 13:44.813
I'm Mr. McBilly.

13:44.849 --> 13:46.316
And this is my son, Buddy.

13:46.351 --> 13:47.700
Hello, Buddy.

13:47.736 --> 13:49.352
Mmm!

13:49.387 --> 13:51.403
He's a little shy.

13:51.439 --> 13:53.231
I'm a bit nervous
to leave him.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.124
Oh, don't you worry,
Mr. McBilly.

13:55.159 --> 13:56.851
We'll take good care
of Buddy

13:56.886 --> 13:57.910
and help him make
lots of friends.

13:59.681 --> 14:01.822
Hear that, sport?

14:01.858 --> 14:04.250
Now I'm off to the store
to find some shoes.

14:04.285 --> 14:06.043
See ya later.

14:10.308 --> 14:11.591
(laughing)

14:14.353 --> 14:16.053
(laughing)

14:18.049 --> 14:20.299
Come on, Buddy.

14:20.334 --> 14:22.376
Come out
and meet everyone.

14:22.411 --> 14:23.644
I'll show you the TurnStyler.

14:23.680 --> 14:24.770
-It's really fun.
-(laughing)

14:26.407 --> 14:28.666
Ee ha ha!

14:28.701 --> 14:30.943
Your royal highness.

14:30.979 --> 14:33.595
Everyone, this is Buddy.

14:33.631 --> 14:35.073
He's new in town.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.674
[all] Hi, Buddy.

14:36.709 --> 14:41.270
Buddy, this is Elray,
Puck, Pearl, Clifford,
and Cleo.

14:41.305 --> 14:42.964
And this is Daisy
and Cuckoo Loca.

14:42.999 --> 14:46.467
Now why don't you take a run
through the TurnStyler?

14:46.502 --> 14:48.544
Yeah! It's really fun!

14:48.579 --> 14:49.503
(kids laughing)

14:54.819 --> 14:55.885
(squeaks)

14:58.547 --> 15:01.707
Oh! So that's where
my chicken costume is.

15:01.742 --> 15:03.917
Isn't that
a little small for you?

15:03.953 --> 15:06.495
I was young once.

15:06.530 --> 15:07.813
(chirping)

15:12.670 --> 15:14.478
[Minnie] Oh, dear!

15:14.513 --> 15:17.706
We're not off to
a very good start
helping him make friends.

15:17.741 --> 15:19.942
Oh, he'll make friends.

15:19.977 --> 15:22.612
And they're
such good kids, too.

15:22.647 --> 15:24.422
Listen how quiet they are.
They--

15:24.457 --> 15:26.114
Hey, where'd they go?!

15:26.150 --> 15:27.942
[Cuckoo Loca]
All the birdies
flew the coop.

15:27.977 --> 15:29.777
<i>  -Wow!</i>
<i>  -Check it out!</i>

15:29.812 --> 15:31.253
-(kids laughing)
-(objects crashing)

15:31.289 --> 15:34.706
Oh, no.
They're in the apartment!

15:34.742 --> 15:36.842
Oh, my! The children
shouldn't be in there!

15:39.255 --> 15:43.483
Come on, Buddy,
we have to go get
your friends.

15:43.518 --> 15:45.584
I can't leave you
here all by yourself.

15:45.620 --> 15:47.920
(intercom buzzing)

15:47.955 --> 15:49.454
[delivery man]<i>  Oh, hi,</i>
<i> I'm here for a pickup.</i>

15:49.490 --> 15:52.291
Oh, yes,
the charity items.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.068
[Elray]
<i>  Hey! Where's Buddy?</i>

15:59.050 --> 16:01.117
(sniffing)

16:05.189 --> 16:06.539
[Daisy]<i>  All this goes.</i>

16:12.705 --> 16:14.755
Bo-Bo?

16:14.791 --> 16:17.108
No, no,
Bo-Bo no go-go.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.560
(squeaks)

16:19.595 --> 16:20.720
(squirrel chattering)

16:22.373 --> 16:23.956
Buddy?

16:23.992 --> 16:26.284
Buddy! Come back!

16:26.319 --> 16:27.685
Whoa, my!

16:30.515 --> 16:33.832
Now, kids,
this is our apartment.

16:33.868 --> 16:37.111
It's where we live,
and it's not for playing.

16:37.146 --> 16:39.805
Oh. Well, can we go
back to the Play Center?

16:39.840 --> 16:41.273
We were supposed
to have a party today.

16:41.308 --> 16:42.933
A party?

16:42.969 --> 16:45.945
(cell phone rings)

16:45.980 --> 16:47.722
<i> Minnie!</i>
<i> Buddy ran off!</i>

16:47.757 --> 16:49.799
<i> And now he's hiding!</i>

16:49.801 --> 16:52.951
Oh, dear! You have to
bring him back right away!

16:52.987 --> 16:54.653
<i> Don't worry!</i>
<i> I'm not letting him get away!</i>

16:54.688 --> 16:56.330
<i>  -Bye. </i>
<i> </i>  -(beeps)

16:56.366 --> 16:59.391
While we're waiting
for Daisy and Buddy
to return...

16:59.426 --> 17:01.552
Uh, Buddy's right here.

17:01.588 --> 17:04.446
Buddy!
Thank goodness.

17:04.482 --> 17:06.983
I'll call Daisy
and let her know
he snuck back.

17:07.018 --> 17:09.818
-(costume squeaking)
-(squirrel chattering)

17:09.853 --> 17:11.654
Buddy, don't be scared!

17:11.689 --> 17:12.997
We're all friends here.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.615
(chattering)

17:14.650 --> 17:18.578
Now, Buddy, that's
not what a chicken
sounds like.

17:18.613 --> 17:20.463
A chicken is more like,
"Cluck, cluck."

17:20.498 --> 17:21.930
(chattering)

17:21.966 --> 17:25.159
(cell phone rings)

17:25.195 --> 17:26.210
-Hello.
-(truck loudly rumbling)

17:26.245 --> 17:28.687
<i> Daisy, I found Buddy.</i>

17:28.722 --> 17:30.798
What?!
I can't hear you!

17:30.833 --> 17:33.400
But, yes, I found Buddy!

17:33.436 --> 17:35.336
<i> No! Buddy's here!</i>

17:35.371 --> 17:36.862
Nobody's here?

17:36.897 --> 17:39.140
You mean the other kids
ran off, too?!

17:39.175 --> 17:41.542
I'll help you
after I grab Buddy! Bye!

17:41.577 --> 17:44.319
Buddy?

17:44.355 --> 17:47.098
-(squirrel chattering)
-Oh!

17:48.818 --> 17:50.000
Quackers!

17:50.036 --> 17:53.020
Buddy! No, no, no!

17:53.056 --> 17:53.763
(kids giggling,
chicks chirping)

17:53.798 --> 17:56.240
[Pearl]
Best party ever!

17:56.275 --> 18:00.302
Minnie, where'd you get
all these party decorations?

18:00.337 --> 18:02.938
A Happy Helper is always
prepared for a party.

18:02.974 --> 18:05.332
Well, the kids are
havin' fun, even Buddy.

18:05.368 --> 18:06.800
(horn toots)

18:06.836 --> 18:07.910
[Cuckoo Loca]
Well, sorta.

18:07.945 --> 18:09.812
Aw, poor kid.

18:09.847 --> 18:11.897
He's right back
to hiding.

18:11.932 --> 18:13.899
But hiding is
his favorite thing.

18:13.934 --> 18:17.820
Ohh... Maybe
that's how we'll help him.

18:17.855 --> 18:19.897
Hey, kids, let's play
Hide and Seek.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.448
(laughing)

18:21.484 --> 18:23.434
I love that game!

18:23.469 --> 18:26.028
Now, everyone hide,
and I'll count to ten.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.472
One, two...

18:28.507 --> 18:31.834
'Scuse me. I-I
don't know where to hide.

18:31.869 --> 18:34.753
Ohh!
I bet Buddy could help.

18:34.789 --> 18:36.897
Oh, Buddy!

18:36.932 --> 18:39.125
Could you help Elray
find a good hiding spot?

18:39.160 --> 18:41.877
Um, sure. Follow me.

18:41.913 --> 18:44.088
-Thanks, Buddy.
-Come on, over here.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.457
One, two...

18:46.492 --> 18:47.408
(squirrel chattering)

18:47.443 --> 18:48.709
Hold on, Buddy!

18:48.744 --> 18:50.177
(chattering) Whoa! Whoa!

18:50.212 --> 18:51.453
-(screams)
-Yike!

18:53.291 --> 18:54.415
Bad doodles!

18:56.503 --> 18:58.169
Oopsy-doodle!

19:01.983 --> 19:03.657
(squeaks)

19:03.692 --> 19:05.793
It's gonna be okay,
Buddy!

19:05.828 --> 19:08.161
Ready or not, here I come.

19:08.197 --> 19:09.705
(giggling)

19:09.740 --> 19:11.832
Oh, I think I found someone.

19:11.868 --> 19:13.592
(gasp) It's Pearl!

19:13.627 --> 19:15.410
(giggle)

19:15.446 --> 19:16.395
-(chirping)
-Hey, Minnie.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.656
-Found Clifford.
-(chirping)

19:19.692 --> 19:22.918
Found Cleo.

19:22.953 --> 19:24.044
And Puck!

19:24.079 --> 19:25.988
(giggling)

19:26.024 --> 19:28.349
Now where
are Elray and Buddy?

19:28.384 --> 19:31.310
They sure do
have good hiding spots.

19:31.346 --> 19:33.737
(muffled giggles)

19:33.772 --> 19:36.716
Aw, there you are.

19:36.751 --> 19:39.443
And since I found you last,
you two win.

19:39.478 --> 19:42.229
-We won! Yeah!
-Awesome!

19:42.265 --> 19:44.148
Thanks for finding us
a great hiding spot, Buddy!

19:44.183 --> 19:46.033
No problem.

19:46.068 --> 19:47.977
Hey, wanna
play ping-pong?

19:48.012 --> 19:50.696
Oh, yeah!
I love ping-pong!

19:50.732 --> 19:52.097
-[Pearl] I wanna play!
-[Puck] Me, too!

19:53.509 --> 19:56.451
(panting) Don't!

19:56.487 --> 19:58.720
Oh! How am I ever gonna
get him down from there?

19:58.755 --> 20:00.272
(ding)

20:03.369 --> 20:04.735
(panting)

20:08.449 --> 20:11.717
(chattering)

20:11.752 --> 20:13.702
Whoa, boy!
Steady!

20:15.731 --> 20:16.905
Whoa-oh!

20:16.940 --> 20:17.906
Not...

20:17.941 --> 20:19.007
goody...

20:19.043 --> 20:20.226
good! Whoa!

20:20.261 --> 20:22.369
Quackers!

20:22.404 --> 20:24.738
Whoa!

20:24.774 --> 20:26.899
Here I come, Buddy!

20:26.934 --> 20:29.585
(laughter)

20:29.620 --> 20:32.146
Oh, Cuckoo Loca,
isn't it wonderful?

20:32.181 --> 20:34.365
Buddy's
finally making friends.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.018
(laughter)

20:37.053 --> 20:38.177
Awesome, Buddy!

20:38.212 --> 20:39.637
Thanks!

20:39.672 --> 20:41.705
Yeah! Way to go!

20:41.741 --> 20:43.933
Pearl,
Buddy's not on our team.

20:43.968 --> 20:46.527
-We lost... again.
-Oh.

20:46.562 --> 20:47.695
(Daisy screams)

20:50.149 --> 20:53.133
Okay. (panting)

20:53.169 --> 20:55.903
It wasn't easy.
I got Buddy.

20:55.938 --> 20:57.955
Buddy? (chuckles)

20:57.991 --> 21:00.341
Buddy's been here
the whole time.

21:00.343 --> 21:02.293
He's here? Well, then
who's in the chicken suit?

21:05.764 --> 21:06.505
(screams)

21:09.318 --> 21:11.260
Way to go, Daisy.

21:11.295 --> 21:12.894
You caught a squirrel
in a chicken suit.

21:12.930 --> 21:14.263
(chattering)

21:16.592 --> 21:18.701
[Mr. McBilly]
<i>  Hello? Is anyone here?</i>

21:18.736 --> 21:20.477
It's my Dad!

21:20.513 --> 21:22.996
It's parent
pick-up time already.

21:23.032 --> 21:25.090
Dad! Look at all
the new friends I made!

21:25.126 --> 21:27.376
All right!

21:27.411 --> 21:30.053
Well, how wonderful.

21:30.088 --> 21:31.613
Thank you,
Happy Helpers.

21:31.649 --> 21:34.208
(chuckles)
It was our pleasure.

21:34.243 --> 21:36.251
Mom, can I have
a play-date with Buddy?

21:36.287 --> 21:38.270
Sure, you can.

21:38.305 --> 21:40.831
Dad, you never
got any shoes.

21:40.867 --> 21:43.017
I couldn't find any
long enough.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.369
Wait here.

21:45.404 --> 21:48.021
Are you thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

21:48.057 --> 21:51.491
Hold your foot up,
please.

21:51.527 --> 21:53.227
What do ya think?

21:53.262 --> 21:55.587
Clown shoes? I love it!

21:55.622 --> 21:58.649

21:58.684 --> 21:59.633
