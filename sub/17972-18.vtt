No.
I never get to do anything.

20:41.607 --> 20:43.357
I guess I should
get out of Stoolbend,

20:43.359 --> 20:45.159
see what the world has to offer.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.094
I just hope I can find someone

20:47.096 --> 20:49.864
who's as devoted to me
as Cleveland is to you.

20:49.866 --> 20:53.200
Ah, you won't.
You're too crazy.

20:53.202 --> 20:55.887
Well, I guess we won't
be needing this.

20:55.889 --> 20:58.205
CLEVELAND:
No!
