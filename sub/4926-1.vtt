04:18.040 --> 04:19.680
Mr. Dobson

04:20.000 --> 04:24.080
It's time for us to do what the Good Lord
would refer to as a "cleansing of the wicked"

04:24.280 --> 04:30.840
and what my brother George, God rest his soul,
used to call "100% Alabama ass kickin'."

04:31.080 --> 04:33.560
So you think we're gonna
die here today?

04:33.880 --> 04:35.520
Dying's not an option.

04:35.680 --> 04:39.520
Now, you stick that back in that gray matter
of yours and you make that stick

04:39.800 --> 04:42.600
'cause any other thought's gonna get
you cold-slabbed, toe-tagged and

04:42.760 --> 04:45.360
mailed home to your mom in a plastic bag.
Are we crystal?

04:45.640 --> 04:47.640
- Crystal, sir.
- Gentlemen!

04:47.800 --> 04:50.200
Let's do what
God made us to do.

04:53.680 --> 04:56.640
This is Sheriff John Quincey Wydell...

04:57.040 --> 05:03.360
of the Ruggsville County Sheriffs Department.
You're completely surrounded!

05:03.720 --> 05:05.880
You have no chance of escape!

05:07.200 --> 05:11.200
Now would be the time
to vacate the premises peacefully.

05:14.280 --> 05:17.160
- There's a million fucking cops!
- Come on.

05:19.080 --> 05:21.680
- Otis, the fucking pigs are everywhere!
- Tell me something I don't know!

05:21.760 --> 05:23.920
- We've gotta do something!
- You're completely surrounded.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.480
You have no chance of escape.

05:26.560 --> 05:30.160
- Can't take the car, about 25 pigs. 
- I know, I know! Shit fuck shit fuck!

05:30.360 --> 05:33.000
- Shit. Where the fuck is Tiny?
- I ain't seen Tiny.

05:33.240 --> 05:36.640
- Tiny! I think he went out last night. 
- Everybody shut up!

05:46.080 --> 05:49.640
- Mama, what's the matter?
- I keep thinking about... old times...

05:50.640 --> 05:55.080
like when you was a fuckin' baby.

05:55.200 --> 05:59.520
- You looked like an angel. 
- I know, Mama. You told me that a million times. 
- Yeah.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.520
Gentlemen!

06:04.760 --> 06:08.200
- On the count of three! 
- Ready? 
- Yeah.

06:09.360 --> 06:13.320
- One! 
- I love you, Mama.
- I love you, Baby. 
- Two!

06:15.720 --> 06:17.000
Let's go.

06:22.480 --> 06:23.840
Three!

06:42.560 --> 06:44.600
Die, you fuckers!

06:55.640 --> 06:57.840
- You okay?!
- Yeah, are you?

07:03.920 --> 07:06.560
- Ready?
- Yeah yeah yeah, go go!

07:31.560 --> 07:33.560
- Hold your fire!

07:33.880 --> 07:36.320
Dobson! Get some tear-gas in that house!

09:31.600 --> 09:34.280
Do not fucking move!

09:36.960 --> 09:40.360
I advise you to lower that weapon.

09:41.080 --> 09:45.200
I'm sorry, Sheriff, but you ain't gettin' me.

09:48.320 --> 09:52.280
Looks like you ain't
gettin' off that easy, huh, bitch?

12:32.440 --> 12:37.040
All right, everybody listen up.
I want this place gone over with a fine-tooth comb.

12:37.240 --> 12:39.840
Wherever these fuckers are,
they gotta be close.

12:40.200 --> 12:44.800
I am standing outside the perimeter of what is
turning out to be the most horrific crime scene

12:44.880 --> 12:48.000
since Jack the Ripper stalked the streets of London.

12:48.080 --> 12:52.360
What police have uncovered reads like this...
words can't describe it...

12:53.080 --> 12:58.320
"Human skulls used as ornaments,
body parts stuffed in refrigerators. "

12:58.680 --> 13:05.880
And I can't believe what it says here: "A mass grave of
decomposing bodies dumped under the crawlspace of the house. "

13:09.400 --> 13:12.360
Hey, Chief, you might wanna check this out.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.600
- What?
- I don't know.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.080
Jesus H Christ.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.720
Motherfucker.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.400
What, you recognize the clown?

13:23.800 --> 13:28.200
Yeah, his name is Spaulding,
Captain fucking Spaulding.

13:34.160 --> 13:37.320
Yeah, ride the horse, baby!
Ride it! Ride it! Yeah yeah yeah.

14:01.760 --> 14:05.000
You gettin' a good ride tonight.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.680
Next time, you gonna have to pay me.

14:11.240 --> 14:13.960
Did you just call me a fucking whore?

14:14.360 --> 14:19.560
- Well, I calls 'em like I sees'em.
- Really? You think I'm a fucking whore?

14:19.640 --> 14:22.040
I don't think it, I know it.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.320
- Whore this, fucker.
- Hey hey hey hey!

14:27.920 --> 14:35.680
Come on now, baby, hold on. I'm just messing with ya. 
You know us clowns, we like to just fool around a bunch, 
you know? Come on.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.600
Laugh.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.240
Clown... laugh!

14:55.800 --> 14:57.680
Poopy, What's the matter,
bad dream?

14:58.000 --> 15:00.320
Yeah, 50-50.

15:00.480 --> 15:04.480
- You want to fool around some more?
- Oh, Jesus Christ, woman, I gotta take a piss.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.200
Didn't you get enough ass-banging last night?

15:07.680 --> 15:09.800
God damn it, my dick is still sore.

15:10.120 --> 15:11.920
- Oh, come on, I'm horny.
- No.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.480
Most guys like that quality in a girl.

15:15.600 --> 15:19.280
Yeah, except you acting like some
kinda spastic mongoloid in heat.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.400
- Fuckin' bitch.
- Hurry!

15:28.880 --> 15:31.960
- Where is it?
- Just calm down, it'll be on in a minute.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.880
I love that monkey.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.600
...I brought all the way from the wilds of Borneo.
When y'all come in,

15:55.640 --> 15:58.400
Make sure you bring
little Johnny and Suzie with you.

15:58.440 --> 16:01.600
She'll scare
the holy guacamole out of 'em.

16:01.640 --> 16:06.800
Ha ha! And remember while you're down here,
pick up a "Captain Spaulding for president" T-shirt all shapes and...

16:09.560 --> 16:12.040
Hey, what the fuck is this?

16:12.080 --> 16:14.960
I paid good money for
this goddamn commercial!

16:15.120 --> 16:18.080
Sheriff, "News Update,"
what is the situation now?

16:19.440 --> 16:21.800
- The situation?
- Now what? God damn it!

16:23.280 --> 16:27.480
- Yeah, what? 
- Daddy, you gotta get outta there. 
The pigs hit us this morning real bad.

16:28.560 --> 16:30.120
- Shut the fuck up!

16:30.520 --> 16:34.120
- They're gonna be coming for you too.
- All right, just calm down.

16:34.160 --> 16:41.000
I'll meet you at the Kahiki Palms Motel just like we always planned. 
- Yeah, okay. 
- I'll be there as soon as I can.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.160
All right, just go now.

16:52.840 --> 16:55.880
- Poopy! What do you need a gun for? Where are we going?
- You ain't going nowhere, bitch.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.960
Get outta my fuckin' way!

16:59.000 --> 17:03.440
If you're out there listening to this, 
I got a message for ya. I'm coming to get ya.

17:03.480 --> 17:09.400
You can't run forever. You're gonna have to stop somewhere, sometime,
and when you do I'm gonna be there to put the wrath of the Lord up your ass.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.599
Poopy, don't go!

17:13.560 --> 17:15.599
God damn it, stop calling me Poopy!

17:15.640 --> 17:19.000
- I want my Poopy! Poopy, no!
- Leave me alone!

17:32.600 --> 17:36.080
In an attempt to help the Ruggsville
Police Department, we here at "News Update"

17:36.160 --> 17:39.560
would like to show you these mug shots 
of the suspects known to have escaped

17:39.600 --> 17:42.520
during the raid earlier this morning.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.920
184 bucks?
What?!

18:22.480 --> 18:25.240
- Candy! 
- What? 
- Candy, come on down here!

18:25.680 --> 18:29.240
Come on, cut that out. Turn it off. 
Candy, come down here!

18:31.080 --> 18:34.280
- Come on down here!
- All right. Shit.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.520
What?

18:36.560 --> 18:39.440
This is bullshit, baby!
What is this?

18:40.040 --> 18:43.080
What do you want me to say?
It's a slow fuckin' night, boss.

18:43.120 --> 18:45.880
All them farmers want is
a quickie hand job and boom!

18:53.200 --> 18:55.000
10 dollar!

18:55.040 --> 18:58.600
Get back on their tractors,
save the real fucking for the sheep.

18:59.320 --> 19:02.160
Jesus, Candy, you gotta figure
a way to hook 'em in.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.600
You gotta hustle that pussy.

19:04.640 --> 19:07.640
Find a new angle and you might
attract a higher clientele.

19:08.400 --> 19:13.400
Yeah, well, I've been thinking about that. I was thinking
about something spacey like that "Star Wars" shit.

19:14.600 --> 19:18.080
You know, them losers wanna
fuck Princess Leia, right?

19:18.400 --> 19:21.720
- I'd fuck her.
- Thank you.

19:21.760 --> 19:26.440
I don't know, you start messing with that spacey shit, 
and you'll really bring out some sick bitches.

19:26.920 --> 19:31.680
They all wanting to pretend they're robots. Last thing 
I need is horny robots running around, tripping over shit.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.320
- Droids... boss, they call 'em droids.
- Whatever.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.120
I still say it's risky.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.400
Wong's Hong Kong Gardens, this is Mr. Wong speaking.

19:44.880 --> 19:47.400
Cut the shit, Charlie.
It's me, Cutter.

19:47.920 --> 19:53.080
I got a serious meltdown going on down here and
I need a place to cool out, so I'm coming down.

19:53.400 --> 19:59.320
- Fuck, man, I don't think it's such a great idea, you coming around here.
- I am coming down... now.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.680
Fuck.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.880
Man, I don't see him.
Shit, where the fuck is he?

20:30.720 --> 20:34.600
Jesus! Can we get over this already?
I mean, I just don't find it funny anymore.

20:35.440 --> 20:38.200
- I don't know, it's still pretty funny.
- I'd say so.

20:39.360 --> 20:42.880
- I hate to be the one to tell you I told you so...
- Then don't.

20:42.920 --> 20:47.000
But ridin' a mechanical bull
is not as easy as it looks.

20:47.040 --> 20:51.200
Technically, she had
a pretty good ride... until tragedy struck.

20:53.080 --> 20:57.200
Hey, the lesson here is that tube tops are
not the proper attire for bull riding, Glory.

20:57.320 --> 21:01.360
I agree with you. You gonna have to put
a harness on them little suckers, honey.

21:02.280 --> 21:05.360
Her "tig bitties" were flappin' around...

21:05.400 --> 21:07.840
My titties don't flap!

21:07.880 --> 21:11.960
- They looked like two raccoons in a gunnysack fighting to get out.
- Oh, Adam, shut up.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.640
I was gonna pee myself!

21:16.160 --> 21:18.400
You're just jealous
'cause you don't have any titties.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.200
Oh, Gloria, come on,
no reason to get mean. Come on, baby.

21:23.360 --> 21:26.880
You had one titty going this way and one titty going that way.
It was pretty amazing.

21:27.400 --> 21:31.320
Chances are high you made
a few fans that night.

21:31.360 --> 21:33.160
Oh, shut up, dipshit.

21:33.200 --> 21:37.080
Well, I told Johnny Cash, and he said... 
did you know I shook hands with Johnny Cash once?

21:38.360 --> 21:43.280
Roy, how about you go
find me the ice machine? I need a drink.

21:43.320 --> 21:47.160
I'll get you the ice, but you gotta
promise us an encore tomorrow.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.720
You wish, honey. Don't you wish.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.640
The babes are
going into seclusion.

21:55.000 --> 22:02.880
The leader of this group who is a local celebrity goes by the name
of Captain Spaulding along with two other suspects known as Otis...

22:02.920 --> 22:06.280
- Aw, shit fuck shit fuck!
- God, calm down. Get rid of the car.

22:06.315 --> 22:09.640
- Don't worry, I'll get us a room.
- Well, hurry the fuck up!

22:09.880 --> 22:11.800
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

22:13.640 --> 22:17.760
Police revealed today that they believe
most of the victims were drugged, kidnapped

22:17.800 --> 22:20.160
...and sexually assaulted.
- God damn it! Fuck!

22:22.280 --> 22:26.040
Hey, Roy, I was doing some research
on that thing I was telling you about.

22:26.080 --> 22:28.640
- What thing?
- Rodeo clowning.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.800
Rodeo...

22:36.000 --> 22:39.200
A rodeo clown?
You been smoking dope.

22:39.280 --> 22:42.440
Yeah... I mean no, not right now.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.720
Let me tell you something.

22:44.880 --> 22:50.600
You spend one second in that pen and that bull'd have
his horn up your ass and sticking out your pecker.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.760
That's exactly what
I thought you'd say.

22:53.920 --> 22:57.080
You know, you can never be supportive
of anything I wanna do.

22:57.320 --> 23:01.760
What do you want me to say? That you're dressed
for the part and headed in the right direction?

23:01.960 --> 23:07.480
Well, Adam was saying... I've always been
good with animals. I mean, dogs love me.

23:07.680 --> 23:11.280
And isn't a horse kinda like a big dog?

23:12.000 --> 23:13.960
I don't know.

23:15.360 --> 23:18.440
No, you're not clown material.

23:18.520 --> 23:23.040
Forget it. I'm gonna walk
on over to the gas station. You want anything?

23:23.120 --> 23:26.440
No... yes.
Get me some of that beef jerky.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.840
Thanks for talking.

23:29.240 --> 23:33.000
I could've been on that pit crew
down in North Carolina.

23:53.480 --> 23:55.560
Hey, pussycat.

23:57.160 --> 23:59.440
Hey, got a light?

24:00.000 --> 24:03.280
No, uh, I don't smoke.

24:03.400 --> 24:07.120
My doctor says I got lungs
like a professional athlete.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.160
- Ah, I get it. You wanna live forever.
- Yeah yeah, well...

24:11.320 --> 24:14.560
- So what, are you on vacation
all by yourself or something?

24:14.760 --> 24:20.240
Yeah... no. I'm actually out here
with my singing group. I do the lead singing for it.

24:20.440 --> 24:24.160
It's called "Banjo and Sullivan. " I used to sing with Johnny Cash.
He shook my hand.

24:24.240 --> 24:28.640
I love famous people. They're so much better than the real thing.

24:29.760 --> 24:32.000
Well, yeah, I suppose they are.

24:32.080 --> 24:35.320
I bet all the girls wanna fuck you.

24:35.880 --> 24:37.600
- Would you say that again?

24:37.720 --> 24:42.400
- I bet all the girls wanna fuck you.

24:46.440 --> 24:48.720
Do you kiss your mama with that mouth?

24:48.800 --> 24:52.040
Trust me, fella, that ain't
the only thing I do with this mouth.

24:52.120 --> 24:54.800
Don't tell me that!
What? Say that again.

24:54.880 --> 24:57.680
That I ain't the only thing
I do with this mouth.

24:58.280 --> 25:03.000
It's so depressing. Let's talk about some
of the symbols of these groups

25:03.160 --> 25:06.800
like the inverted cross
or the pentagram or the number 666

25:07.040 --> 25:09.600
left at the scene of the crime.
What do you think about that?

25:13.960 --> 25:22.800
- This is not an isolated incident.
- Well, members of these cults realize they have no chance of attacking God directly. 
So the next best thing...

25:23.200 --> 25:28.160
Adam, could you switch this?
I can't stand to hear about this.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.120
What do I look like, Roy?

25:30.200 --> 25:34.360
I'm Sullivan,
Roy Sullivan.

25:35.240 --> 25:40.040
Well... Roy Sullivan. You gonna take me
back to your room and play with me?

25:40.760 --> 25:42.440
My wife's in that room.

25:42.520 --> 25:47.160
Or is my brother gonna have to shoot
your fucking teeth out of your head?

25:47.560 --> 25:50.000
Okay, let's go, Hoss.
Move it.

25:51.440 --> 25:56.400
Just makes me sick to my stomach to think
that we live in a world where there are Satanic cults.

25:56.480 --> 25:58.880
- Come on, Gloria, it's a bunch of crap.
- I don't know.

25:58.920 --> 26:02.960
Look at these two idiots. They're just exaggerating
all this shit to try and kick up ratings.

26:03.120 --> 26:08.600
They wanna get people scared so they stay
at home, buy TV dinners. Fuck me running.

26:08.880 --> 26:12.440
I don't know about that.
That business down in Ruggsville...

26:13.280 --> 26:18.600
Ruggsville? Ruggsville can kiss my ass. Ain't nothing but
a bunch of local cousinfuckers corn-holing the livestock.

26:19.480 --> 26:22.640
Could you just switch it
for me anyway, please?

26:22.720 --> 26:26.800
Jesus Christ, I don't know
how Roy puts up with your shit.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.840
What is taking Roy
so long, anyway?

26:32.720 --> 26:35.840
Get on the bed!

26:40.000 --> 26:42.880
Shut up! Did I tell you
to fucking speak?

26:47.200 --> 26:49.160
God damn it, look at that jacket.

26:49.240 --> 26:51.040
- What?
- On TV.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.600
- Well, fuck the TV.
- Fuck the TV? Fuck you!

26:56.720 --> 26:59.320
Will you keep your head
on the business at hand?

27:00.880 --> 27:03.480
- Who's in the shower?
- That's my wife!

27:04.680 --> 27:07.120
What are you gonna do, man?
What the fuck are you gonna do?

27:07.600 --> 27:10.040
I wanna know what the fuck
are you gonna do?

27:20.520 --> 27:25.960
- Don't hurt her, please.
- Is this everyone?

27:26.800 --> 27:32.280
Hey, Roy. Open up. I got some of that
Dr. Corndog's hickory-smoked jerky.

27:33.600 --> 27:39.080
- Who the fuck is that?
- That's Jimmy. He's our roadie. I forgot all about him.

27:43.440 --> 27:47.280
- Now I know I can't trust you!
- I'll get him.

27:49.720 --> 27:53.280
I'm sorry. I got the wrong room. 
I'm looking for room number two.

27:53.480 --> 27:56.040
No, you got the right room.
Come on in.

27:56.120 --> 27:59.360
- Is Roy in there?
- Roy's in here, all right. Come on in.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.840
Get your ass in here!
On your knees!

28:03.280 --> 28:04.920
Roy, help...

28:13.440 --> 28:15.000
Shut up!

28:19.080 --> 28:21.320
- God damn it! Fuck!

28:32.520 --> 28:34.920
Come on, honey.
Mommy has to get to work.

28:35.000 --> 28:39.120
If I'm late one more time,
Mr. McDonnell is gonna can my ass.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.480
Will you get in the car?!

28:46.120 --> 28:49.680
- Okay, come on, let's go get in.
- Mom, a clown.

28:49.760 --> 28:53.480
Yeah yeah, a clown.
Oh... hi.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.000
Hi. I'm gonna have to
be taking your car today.

28:56.080 --> 29:01.560
See, I have some top-secret clown business that supersedes
any plans that you might have for this here vehicle.

29:02.920 --> 29:05.640
What's that about clown business?

29:08.080 --> 29:10.840
Do I stutter, bitch?

29:10.920 --> 29:13.400
Jamie, get in the car.
Lock the door.

29:13.440 --> 29:15.880
Where the hell you going?
Damn it.

29:16.040 --> 29:19.360
Don't you never turn your back
on a fucking clown when he's talking to you!

29:19.680 --> 29:21.480
Get your fucking hands off of me!

29:29.240 --> 29:31.840
What's the matter, kid?
Don't you like clowns?

29:32.040 --> 29:36.040
Why? Don't we
make you laugh?

29:36.320 --> 29:38.680
Aren't we fucking funny?

29:38.840 --> 29:43.280
You best come up with an answer 'cause I'm gonna
come back here and check on you and your mama.

29:43.320 --> 29:49.640
If you ain't got a reason why you hate clowns,
I'm gonna kill your whole fucking family.

29:50.080 --> 29:53.440
All right, now get your fucking ass
out the car! Go on! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!

30:04.920 --> 30:09.840
Chinese, Japanese,
dirty knees, look at these.

30:23.560 --> 30:26.680
Hoss, are you staring
at my sister thinking bad thoughts?

30:26.920 --> 30:29.960
- No.
- Why not? You a faggot?

30:30.160 --> 30:33.000
- No.
- Well, what are you?

30:33.120 --> 30:37.680
I mean, you got this hot piece of ass shaking her shit
right in front of you and you're not getting any ideas?

30:37.880 --> 30:39.200
What do you call that?

30:39.680 --> 30:41.600
I'm a married man.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.640
A married fucking man.
Hey, that's just great!

30:44.680 --> 30:49.480
Let's give him a big round
of applause, folks, for the married man!

30:53.320 --> 30:56.640
Okay, Mama,
front and center, on your feet.

30:58.160 --> 31:01.160
- Don't hurt her.
- Get on your feet.

31:01.440 --> 31:03.120
Come on. Let's go.

31:03.240 --> 31:05.000
Please, mister,
this is insane.

31:05.120 --> 31:10.280
Boy... the next word that comes outta your mouth
better be some brilliant fucking Mark Twain shit,

31:10.440 --> 31:13.080
'cause it's definitely getting
chiseled on your tombstone.

31:16.120 --> 31:21.760
Okay, come on, Mama. Take that shit off, let's see what's
been holding Hoss's balls at attention all these years.

31:21.800 --> 31:23.160
- What?
- What?

31:23.200 --> 31:28.280
Take off your clothes, or one of these assholes
is going to die.

31:40.160 --> 31:41.240
Come on, come on.

31:41.560 --> 31:46.240
Shit, way to go, Roy! She ain't too bad.
She got a tight little ass on her!

31:48.720 --> 31:51.680
And she got some
child-rearing hips.

31:55.360 --> 31:57.280
- Huh, yeah, hey.
- Please don't hurt me.

31:57.400 --> 32:02.960
Here, ooh, Jeez.
Roy, beginning to see what you mean.

32:12.440 --> 32:16.960
You like this, don't ya?
Say "Yes, I do. "

32:18.520 --> 32:20.480
You like that, don't ya?
Say "Yes, I do. "

32:20.880 --> 32:23.280
Yes, I do.

32:27.520 --> 32:29.240
Yes, I do.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.880
Yes, I do.

32:39.760 --> 32:43.880
Give me some sugar. Make it sweet.
Don't want me to tense up my trigger finger.

32:45.160 --> 32:46.400
My finger's getting tense...

32:53.280 --> 32:54.840
I want you to say,
"You're the almighty devil,

32:55.160 --> 32:58.400
and I want you to make me
my filthy whore. "

33:00.240 --> 33:04.880
Come on, say it. I know it.
I know you're feeling it. Say it.

33:05.360 --> 33:10.680
You're... the... almighty... devil and
I want you... to make me your... fucking whore.

33:26.320 --> 33:28.400
You make me sick.

33:30.760 --> 33:33.760
I feel like we're all really getting
to know each other now.

33:34.040 --> 33:36.840
All right, ladies.
Me and the boys have an errand to run.

33:38.560 --> 33:41.080
We'll be back in a little while.
Come on, Hoss, move it, let's go.

33:41.400 --> 33:43.680
Come on, shit stain! Gotta go!

33:44.680 --> 33:46.640
Come on! God damn it!

33:47.440 --> 33:53.080
Authorities struggle to comprehend the grizzly remains
found in what is now being called

33:53.240 --> 33:54.840
the most heinous crime in American history.

33:55.000 --> 34:00.760
The group responsible for these murders is now being
referred to as "The Devil's Rejects" by the local media.

34:00.960 --> 34:05.240
A woman known only as "Mother Firefly"
was taken into police custody today

34:05.480 --> 34:10.080
after a violent gun battle with police
that left four officers dead and seven wounded.

34:10.120 --> 34:13.840
I'm Derek Sanderson
bringing the world to your doorstep.

34:26.239 --> 34:28.120
Open the gate.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.199
my name is Sheriff
John Quincey Wydell.

34:35.520 --> 34:40.679
Let's see
who we got here. Miss Gloria Teasdale,

34:41.639 --> 34:46.440
alias Eve Wilson,
alias Southern Betty Woods...

34:46.800 --> 34:48.600
Betsy Woods.

34:49.960 --> 34:53.560
And of course, alias Mother Firefly.

34:54.320 --> 34:59.400
- You can read. Congratulations.
- Four counts, grand theft auto.

35:00.200 --> 35:05.360
Five counts, armed robbery.
What's this?

35:05.600 --> 35:11.120
Looks like your specialty... 17
counts, solicitation and prostitution.

35:12.720 --> 35:15.520
You've been one busy whore..

35:15.720 --> 35:18.240
I bet them old farmboys love you.

35:18.520 --> 35:20.640
Everyone loves me.

35:20.840 --> 35:24.400
Don't you pretend...

35:24.880 --> 35:27.320
you don't fancy me.

35:27.520 --> 35:30.760
Oh, yes, ma'am.
I find you quite irresistible.

35:31.080 --> 35:35.080
- Dobson. - Yes, sir. 
- Put them books over there. - Got it.

35:39.920 --> 35:42.000
Ma'am, you recognize
these books, here?

35:47.800 --> 35:49.800
Oh! Ain't she an angel?

35:50.000 --> 35:53.640
Well, she gonna be one dead angel
when I catch up to her...

35:53.800 --> 35:56.440
you, your whole clan,
you dead already.

35:56.640 --> 35:59.760
You're just ghosts,
just waiting to expire.

36:00.360 --> 36:04.920
The way I figure it, only choice you got
is to cooperate and tell me where they are.

36:05.440 --> 36:10.560
That way your little angel over there don't have
to die like no dog in the streets when I catch her.

36:10.760 --> 36:13.080
- Are you done trying to scare me?
- No, ma'am.

36:14.920 --> 36:18.720
With God as my witness... I have only just begun.

36:18.840 --> 36:23.280
Oh... Sheriff... can I show you something?

36:24.960 --> 36:32.160
I'll need this book here. I did never... get
around to putting these in the book proper.

36:33.520 --> 36:37.280
And I thought... you might enjoy them.

36:38.680 --> 36:42.880
Oh... you know... he was a real sweetie pie.

36:43.880 --> 36:47.200
Tall... big moustache...

36:47.960 --> 36:50.800
bald head...
You know, I feel contrite

36:51.920 --> 36:57.280
about blowing his brains out,
'cause he seemed like such a nice man.

36:59.880 --> 37:05.440
I think... he said... his name
was also Wydell.

37:06.440 --> 37:09.800
Was he kin to you?

37:17.880 --> 37:20.280
Listen to me, you gonna listen to me good.

37:20.560 --> 37:26.080
I'm going to kill every member of your family.
I am gonna hunt them down like animals and skin 'em alive.

37:26.120 --> 37:29.760
They are gonna feel the pain
and suffering of every last victim.

37:29.800 --> 37:34.800
They're gonna crawl on their hands and knees and beg
me for mercy, but all I'm gonna have for 'em is pain.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.960
You go get 'em, Sheriff!

37:44.760 --> 37:50.480
Go get your ghost! Them ghosts is gonna
crawl right up in your h-e-e-e-ead!

37:53.320 --> 37:57.800
You found yourself into something
you ain't never getting out of!

37:59.280 --> 38:05.240
We'll get ya! We'll... get ya!
We'll get ya! You're dead, Sheriff!

38:05.920 --> 38:11.520
You're dead!
I'll see you in fucking hell!

38:48.800 --> 38:51.800
Hey, Hoss,
you like this song?

38:54.240 --> 38:58.120
Do you like this song?

38:59.600 --> 39:02.480
I don't know.
Yeah, I guess so.

39:03.280 --> 39:05.640
- Oh, really?
- Which way?

39:05.680 --> 39:08.880
- Take a right.
You like that Top 40 shit?

39:10.000 --> 39:16.040
I thought you were like some kinda
true-blue-balls-earnest-kill-'em country fucker.

39:16.080 --> 39:19.200
You're nothing but a city faggot
with a cowboy hat.

39:20.640 --> 39:21.960
Stop here.

39:28.080 --> 39:30.080
Okay, get out.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.560
This way.

39:42.800 --> 39:45.080
Follow the yellow brick road.

39:51.320 --> 39:52.800
That's right.

39:54.120 --> 39:55.400
Go on.

40:05.400 --> 40:09.560
You know, Hoss, if I'm not mistaken, I think
I can smell your wife's pussy-stink on my gun.

40:11.760 --> 40:13.840
Hope it doesn't rust the barrel.

40:18.760 --> 40:21.520
You know, the stress
of the day is really setting in on me.

40:23.200 --> 40:28.080
You guys happen to know how a guy
like me could relieve some tension?

40:29.160 --> 40:34.640
Ah, maybe... I think your wife Wendy, boy,
looks like she could relieve some tension.

40:34.680 --> 40:37.320
- Mister, where we going?
- Those little titties...

40:37.360 --> 40:39.640
we're going down
the road here.

40:39.680 --> 40:42.320
Those little titties,
she's got a tight little ass.

40:42.520 --> 40:45.880
Does she like it when you puke?
Is that part of your deal?

40:46.600 --> 40:48.560
Where you taking us?

40:49.720 --> 40:53.040
Well, I guess, it wouldn't
do no harm to tell you none.

40:53.080 --> 40:57.080
We're gonna go dig up some guns
I buried out here a couple years ago.

40:57.120 --> 41:01.080
- Then what?
- Well, there ain't no "what. " That's the end of the road.

41:08.040 --> 41:12.280
- You're not gonna kill us, are you?
- Killing sounds so permanent.

41:12.680 --> 41:15.600
We did everything
you want, mister, just let us go.

41:15.640 --> 41:19.800
- We did what you said.
- First of all, I didn't say anything.

41:19.840 --> 41:22.040
And second of all,
I'm calling the shots!

41:22.080 --> 41:24.440
Consider me fucking
Willy fucking Wonka!

41:24.480 --> 41:27.480
This is my fucking chocolate factory!
You got it?! My factory...

41:28.160 --> 41:29.760
Get him, Roy!

41:30.760 --> 41:32.960
Get the gun, Roy!

42:46.760 --> 42:48.840
Please, mister, stop.
Please, stop.

42:49.800 --> 42:53.760
- Stop?
Bitch, I have just started.

42:54.720 --> 42:57.320
You know, I was gonna take
it easy on you, boy,

42:57.360 --> 42:59.520
but you brought this
down on yourself.

42:59.960 --> 43:04.680
You had to come
all fucking-big-stick- walking-tall like a big, fucking hero!

43:04.720 --> 43:08.720
You got yourself to blame. Look at you now,
hero! You're gonna fucking bleed to death.

43:09.480 --> 43:11.160
Fuck you!

43:13.360 --> 43:16.120
That's what they all say,
"Fuck you!"

43:16.160 --> 43:21.520
Well, it ain't gonna save ya.
It don't scare me none and don't make you a hero!

43:25.120 --> 43:27.880
Wanna see what happens
to heroes, boy?

43:28.200 --> 43:31.920
You wanna see bad-ass, motherfucker?
I'll show you bad-ass!

43:35.000 --> 43:36.800
Roy!

43:39.440 --> 43:43.800
Hoss, I want you to pray to your God.
I want you to pray that He comes and saves you.

43:44.040 --> 43:47.560
I want lightning to come down
and crash upon my fucking head!

43:49.640 --> 43:51.520
- I pray... Jesus...
- Louder!

43:51.560 --> 43:56.520
- Bless the bunnies, bless the little birds...
- I don't feel anything.

43:56.760 --> 43:59.520
bless the springtime morning.

44:01.480 --> 44:05.680
I feel it! Oh, Great God
Almighty, I repent, I repent!

44:05.720 --> 44:09.360
I feel the love
of the God-God-God Almighty!

44:10.000 --> 44:12.280
Oh, the Holy Spirit
is in my body!

44:20.120 --> 44:23.920
I am the devil, and I am here
to do the devil's work.

44:43.880 --> 44:48.280
- You fucking motherfucker! Son of a bitch!
- I've got other plans for you... hero.

45:18.320 --> 45:20.880
Shut the fuck up!

45:27.360 --> 45:30.480
Can I go to the bathroom, please?
I'm about to piss myself.

45:34.840 --> 45:40.320
Excuse me... Can she go to
the bathroom? Please?

45:40.360 --> 45:44.600
What?! I heard you the first time.
I was just thinking. What are you gonna do for me?

45:44.840 --> 45:50.680
- What?
- Go piss yourself for all I care. If you want special favors, you gotta give me something in return.

45:51.720 --> 45:53.680
What do you want?

45:56.800 --> 45:59.920
I want you
to hit her in the face.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.080
- What?
- I know you heard me.

46:06.920 --> 46:08.680
Go ahead.

46:10.080 --> 46:11.480
Go on.

46:13.440 --> 46:16.000
Make it hurt, no love taps.
I want to hear it.

46:22.400 --> 46:24.800
Harder, she ain't gonna break.

46:36.920 --> 46:39.400
You better make this
next one fucking count!

46:51.800 --> 46:53.840
Good, very nice.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.600
Now you come here.

46:56.920 --> 47:00.080
Right here.
Kneel down.

47:01.600 --> 47:04.560
Give me a kiss and say, "Thank you,
Baby, I'm having a great time. "

47:08.280 --> 47:10.360
Thanks, Baby,
I had a really good time.

47:10.800 --> 47:12.640
Now make it fast, bitch!

47:14.920 --> 47:16.880
Don't try anything cute!

47:30.160 --> 47:32.000
Now, what do you
want to do?

47:41.000 --> 47:42.160
Help!

47:42.240 --> 47:44.600
Damn it, I knew that cunt
would do something stupid.

47:44.840 --> 47:46.600
Shut up!
Open the fucking door!

47:47.280 --> 47:50.200
- Open the goddamn door!
- Okay! Hold it!

47:58.280 --> 48:00.880
- Somebody help me!
- What are you gonna do, shoot me?

48:01.360 --> 48:03.400
What did I ever really do to you?

48:04.200 --> 48:06.800
I swear I'll do it. I'll kill you.

48:07.880 --> 48:12.280
Why would you want to kill me?
I'm you're only hope, my brother's fucking crazy.

48:12.360 --> 48:15.080
- Wendy, it's all right! Come on out...

48:37.400 --> 48:39.680
Go ahead, shoot me.
Shoot me right in the ass!

48:45.520 --> 48:48.280
Stupid cunt!
Ain't no bullets in this thing.

48:48.640 --> 48:50.360
It's all fucking mind power.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.760
Somebody, help! Somebody, please!

49:22.080 --> 49:23.440
Help! Help! Help!

49:30.320 --> 49:31.920
Help me! Help me!

49:36.960 --> 49:39.280
- Whoa whoa, darling.
- She's crazy!

49:39.920 --> 49:41.760
Daddy, grab that bitch!

50:04.440 --> 50:06.680
Hey, Chief,
I think I got something.

50:07.160 --> 50:08.480
What?

50:08.560 --> 50:15.160
This Captain Spaulding guy, Captain Spaulding's
a character from "Animal Crackers," a Marx Brothers' movie.

50:16.200 --> 50:17.560
I'll be damned.

50:17.880 --> 50:20.400
- Think it means anything?
- I don't know.

50:22.280 --> 50:25.760
Tell you what, you get that
movie critic over here. What's his name?

50:26.400 --> 50:30.360
- Marty Walker?
- Yeah, that's him. Tell him to get his ass over here as soon as he can.

50:30.800 --> 50:35.760
Tell him to bring whatever information he's got about the Marx
Brothers, particularly characters Groucho played in his movies.

50:36.120 --> 50:38.760
All right,
I'll get right on it.

50:38.960 --> 50:41.160
This shit's just getting
weirder and weirder.

50:49.600 --> 50:53.120
- Shit, Daddy, I didn't think you were coming.
- I'm cool.

50:54.800 --> 50:59.000
- Where the fuck is Otis?
- Not back from getting the guns yet.

50:59.400 --> 51:04.000
You wanna fuck with me? Huh, bitch?
You ain't got what it takes.

51:04.200 --> 51:06.360
He fucks this up,
I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.

51:06.600 --> 51:09.200
You believe this bitch had the balls
to try and fuck with me?

51:11.840 --> 51:16.160
Cox, nice of you to make it.
Enjoying your meal?

51:16.800 --> 51:20.800
What? I gotta eat. My blood sugar gets off,
I'm not gonna be any good to anybody.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Ya ain't no good
to nobody anyhow.

51:24.240 --> 51:27.600
Listen here, that movie expert
guy's here. Wanna talk to him? Want me to bring him in?

51:28.720 --> 51:33.600
All right, all right, I'll get him right now.
Mr. Walker? Come on in, please.

51:33.680 --> 51:37.640
Sheriff Wydell, it's a pleasure.
I rushed right over as soon as I got your call.

51:38.160 --> 51:42.200
You came to the right man.
I happen to be a self-proclaimed Marx Brothers expert if I say so myself.

51:42.280 --> 51:45.040
I'm sure your knowledge
of bullshit is limitless.

51:45.560 --> 51:47.760
Why don't we get to the point?
What do you got for me?

51:47.920 --> 51:51.960
I got a fucking grocery list for you
of all the major Marx Brothers characters and

51:52.160 --> 51:56.000
related characters, and I made a secondary list of any
and all films having to do with Groucho,

51:56.080 --> 51:58.160
including such gems as
"A Girl in Every Port,"

51:58.240 --> 52:01.320
and "Skidoo," where Groucho played the part of God...

52:02.960 --> 52:05.160
directed by Otto Preminger,
who happened to be Jewish,

52:05.520 --> 52:08.800
although he played a Nazi commandant
in "Stalag 17" directed by Billy Wilder.

52:09.440 --> 52:13.120
Otto Preminger also directed "Exodus,"
and it's rumored that at the premiere

52:13.200 --> 52:16.720
Mort Sahl stood up, yelled at the screen,
"Otto! Let my people go!"

52:16.800 --> 52:18.080
Give me the damn list.

52:18.480 --> 52:22.440
It's ironic, don't ya think?
Nazi, State of Israel?

52:22.600 --> 52:25.280
They're all here,
all the aliases...

52:25.600 --> 52:28.080
"Rufus Firefly, Otis Driftwood,

52:28.280 --> 52:29.880
Captain Spaulding"... all of 'em.

52:30.040 --> 52:34.000
Hey, Chief, I'm thinking we ought to
track down this Groucho Marx guy,

52:34.200 --> 52:36.400
ask him a few questions,
maybe he's involved.

52:36.600 --> 52:38.600
Idiot, he died last year.
He died, didn't he?

52:38.800 --> 52:44.080
Oh God damn it. God damn it, see?
That right there is one sad, pathetic state of cinematic affairs.

52:44.240 --> 52:47.840
- If you weren't a cop, I'd wring your neck.
- Hey, let's take that down a notch.

52:47.960 --> 52:50.600
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

52:50.880 --> 52:55.120
This sneering, rotating,
gyrating pelvis son of a bitch,

52:55.320 --> 52:59.560
he died three days before Groucho,
stole all the goddamn headlines.

52:59.720 --> 53:01.760
That goddamn, fucking
Elvis Presley.

53:01.920 --> 53:03.520
What did you say
about The King?

53:03.720 --> 53:05.640
I said he died three
days before Grouch...

53:05.840 --> 53:13.120
You ever say another derogatory word about Elvis Aaron Presley
in my presence again, I will kick the living shit out of you!

53:13.400 --> 53:16.640
You get this Hollywood-loving
pussy out of my face.

53:16.800 --> 53:18.800
- Elvis is in Hollywood!
- Get the hell outta here!

53:18.880 --> 53:21.920
- His first film... - Get out! - ... "Love
Me Tender," was based on an Irish folk song!

53:23.120 --> 53:24.680
Fuck Groucho!

53:56.480 --> 53:59.360
- Don't you fucking knock?
- Where the fuck you been?

53:59.760 --> 54:03.280
- Did you get everything?
- Oh, yeah, I got everything.

54:04.760 --> 54:08.080
You, motherfucker!
Where the fuck have you been?

54:08.520 --> 54:10.880
Hey! You got a problem
with my timeframe son,

54:10.960 --> 54:16.440
- you best spit it out right now.
- Yeah, I got a problem. I got a big fucking problem, bozo!

54:16.840 --> 54:22.520
Well, make your move, laddie, two hits.
I hit you and your dick hits the fucking dirt.

54:22.560 --> 54:25.320
Old man, you ain't
hitting nothing!

54:30.280 --> 54:33.080
Hey, cut the shit, we gotta
get the fuck outta here.

54:33.320 --> 54:35.760
What are we gonna
do with this one?

54:37.600 --> 54:40.680
Leave her for
a maid to clean up.

54:42.280 --> 54:44.520
I got a better idea.

54:58.760 --> 55:03.160
We regret to inform you that the "Banjo and Sullivan Show"
will be canceled tonight.

55:45.600 --> 55:47.120
Housekeeping.

57:38.360 --> 57:41.160
Jesus Christ.
What a fucking mess.

57:41.320 --> 57:45.840
40-ton truck has
a tendency of doing that, Kenny.

57:46.040 --> 57:50.960
Listen, you mind getting one of your donut brigade to
go over there and scoop up some of that skull matter?

57:51.000 --> 57:53.720
Put it in a bag
for the meds.

57:53.920 --> 57:55.720
Yeah, you got it.

57:55.880 --> 57:58.000
Is that the lady
who found her?

57:58.200 --> 58:01.840
Yeah, the maid.
That's Maria Gomez.

58:02.040 --> 58:04.320
- She say anything?
- Yeah, a lot of things.

58:04.640 --> 58:08.720
But I don't speaka no Spanish.
It's all mumbo jumbo to me.

58:09.040 --> 58:11.760
Shit, what am I,
the mayor of Tijuana?

58:12.280 --> 58:17.560
Got one guy, Clarks, he speaks Spanish,
but he called in sick

58:18.400 --> 58:21.040
from what he calls
"explosive diarrhea. "

58:21.440 --> 58:25.560
You mind sparing me any further details
about your deputy's asshole, Kenny?

58:28.440 --> 58:30.560
Senorita Gomez?

58:45.640 --> 58:46.920
What'd I tell ya? She's useless.

58:47.200 --> 58:48.960
Chief!

58:49.280 --> 58:54.040
got a couple shit-kickers over there,
says they're here to meet you.

58:54.320 --> 58:56.320
- Recognize those guys?
- Yeah, I know 'em.

59:08.720 --> 59:11.680
- What's going on, shitheads?
- Sheriff.

59:13.080 --> 59:16.120
Here's the list of names I need you
to run down for me.

59:16.400 --> 59:20.760
- That's a funny-ass name.
- Look who's fucking talking, Rondo.

59:21.680 --> 59:25.360
- Just call me if anything connects.
- I'm sure it will.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.480
Shit always floats our way, don't it? Chief.

59:29.720 --> 59:33.640
You keep your mouth open wide enough,
maybe you'd catch it all.

59:33.840 --> 59:36.400
Don't fuck this up, assholes.

59:36.440 --> 59:40.960
- Have fun scraping all them brains up off the road.
- See ya later, Kenny.

59:51.120 --> 59:54.520
This is bullshit. I trust that fucker
Charlie about as much as I trust you.

59:54.560 --> 59:57.120
Where the hell you get off
talking shit about Charlie?

59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.600
Hey, I know what I know,
and I know I don't like that nut sack.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:04.720
Well, unless you got a better suggestion,
I suggest you keep your fucking pie hole shut.

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:08.240
That is the only
remotely safe place I know about.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:13.840
Hey, man, if anyone's interested,
I think I'm gonna be wanting some ice cream in about 10 miles.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.040
"Hey man, think I'm gonna be wanting some ice cream in about 10 miles. "

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.480
Don't you fucking imitate me!
It's fucking rude!

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:22.080
"I know what I know
and I know I don't like that nut sack. "

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.880
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.760
Two fucking seconds for the kids,
is that gonna kill you?

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:32.760
Yes, it is gonna kill me. I have calculated the time and two seconds
is the exact amount of time that's a hazard to my fucking health!

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.600
Come on, don't be
such a fucking drag, I'm starving.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:40.520
- Hey, eat this.
- What is your fucking problem? I'm in and out in two seconds.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:45.320
I think I'm gonna get me
tuttifuckingfruity.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.880
Tuttifuckingfruity,
that sounds good.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.680
- Tuttifuckingfruity!
- Shut up!

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:01.680
There is no fucking ice cream
in your fucking future.

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.160
Mm, dee-licious!

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:20.320
I don't know why you have to be
such a grouch. This is really good. Here, have some.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.800
Fuck you.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.560
Tuttifuckingfruity!

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:18.680
Hey, piggy... Yeah, over here, come on.
Come and get it.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:25.440
Yes, Mr. Wy-fucking-dell.
Piggy, come over here and get some.

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:32.160
- Don't fucking move, clown.
- You looking for somebody?

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:40.920
George? What the hell you doing
down here, George?

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.240
I live here now.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:51.280
No. You got that all wrong, George.
I mean, this ain't your home.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.960
I got no choice, Johnny.

01:02:54.760 --> 01:03:00.680
This here is my fate. I cannot rest until
this whole thing is over.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:06.680
And I'm asking you, brother...
kill 'em, John. End this shit now.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.160
I'm-I'm walking the line on this,
brother. I'm walking the line.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:16.640
Well, Mother pin a rose on me.
That is so great.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:21.440
I want these motherfuckers dead!
Kill 'em!

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:34.160
- Yeah?
- Hey, I think I found your guy.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:40.200
Yeah, a friend of mine, about 10 years ago,
he used to buy hooch from this guy out here.

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:44.960
Went by the name
of Wolf J Flywheel.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.840
Yeah, but-but his partner
called himself "The Captain. "

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.680
Sounds like the fuckers
we're looking for, huh?

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.160
Yeah, Wolf J Flywheel.
That name's on the list.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:01.680
Apparently, now Wolf J
goes by the name of Charlie Altamont.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.960
All right, good.
You know what to do.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:10.640
We wouldn't be talking if I didn't.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.800
- So is the shit on?
- The shit is on.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.040
Open the door, Deputy.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.600
Take the night off, Freddy.
I'll watch the prisoner.

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:42.640
Well well well, working late tonight,
aren't we, Sheriff?

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:48.160
What's the matter? Can't sleep?
Hell running loose in the streets?

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.840
Or did ya just miss Mama?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.840
As a matter of fact,
I was feeling kinda lonely.

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:03.040
I knew you couldn't
stay away.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.760
I got that power over men.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.760
Women like me are a rare breed.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.800
- Don't you agree?
- Oh, yes, ma'am, I do.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.240
I ain't been broken,
you know.

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.840
Men like that.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:23.440
Ooh, you got me going
this afternoon.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.920
You think you can break me?
You like it rough?

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:36.240
Oh, honey, you can have it
any way you want.

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.640
I don't want it rough.

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:48.320
I like it hot and slow.

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:55.840
- Hot... and slow.
- Mmm.

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.720
- You like that, Mama?
- Oh, yeah.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:29.360
I know that ain't Cutter walking
towards me with that stupid grin.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:35.280
'Cause I know I swore if I ever saw that dumb-cunt-no-
good-piece-of-shit-motherfucking brother of mine,

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:39.680
he'd soon be a dead piece- of-shit-
no-good-motherfucking brother of mine.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:43.840
Okay, everybody in the peanut gallery,
Simon says hands up.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:47.040
He said put your fucking hands up!

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:49.840
What the fuck
is this shit?

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:53.520
You bring us all the way out here
and this prick pulls a gun on us?

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:58.320
- Nice fucking plan, daisy.
- Just do it! He's a crazy pigfucking son...

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.560
What'd you call me?!

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:07.200
Well, if you give me a chance, I was gonna call you
a crazy-pig- fucking-dumb-ass-pussy piece of shit.

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.960
Oh, brother, you's a dead man.

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:23.319
Ain't that the most goddamn
realest water gun you ever did see?

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:32.920
Sorry about that, it's just a little game we
used to always play on folks and it still works!

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.600
- Hell, yeah.
- That's a fucking hoot.

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:38.160
- Johnny, this is my daughter, Baby.
- My niece?

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.399
You all grown up.
Give me some love!

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:47.000
- And you remember happy boy here.
- Are you still an asshole?

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:52.240
This is Casey, my most limber lady.

01:08:52.479 --> 01:08:57.240
And this is Candy, my special lady
and my... top-earning gal.

01:08:57.279 --> 01:08:59.560
- What you looking at?
- I'm looking at you, mama.

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:02.920
- You see something you like?
- Maybe.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:06.880
I set my standards pretty low
so I'm never disappointed.

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:09.479
Oh, well,
I don't disappoint.

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:18.720
Fuck, let's go inside. No sense standing around
like... stonefoot roosters in a fuck farm!

01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:23.040
- Let's celebrate.
- Oh, yeah.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.880
You know,
I gotta tell ya,

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:58.480
that is some catch-phrase
you got there.

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.080
"Devil's Rejects. "

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:11.160
You got something
to say to me, clown?

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:15.160
I bet you scare
lots of folks, don't ya?

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:25.320
Yeah, you're a regular,
fucking killer.

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:29.800
You want a piece of this, motherfucker?
You want a piece of this?!

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:34.360
Huh? What you got?!
What you got?!

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:46.880
Lord, I am
Your arm of justice.

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.280
Your righteous sword
of vengeance.

01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:00.880
Let my blows be true.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.400
What a morning.

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.720
- Clevon!
- Yeah, boss.

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:20.480
- You know why I come here to get these chickens?
- No, boss.

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:23.880
'Cause my brother makes
the best fried chicken in the world.

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:27.240
- Is that right?
- Good morning, good morning, sir! How are you?

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:30.400
- How y'all doing? Good morning.
- Good good good. What ya got for me?

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:34.440
- We got these real cute barred rock chickens here.
- Yeah, I see it.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:39.640
- Got them nice, long-legged... Rhode Island red chickens.
- Rhode Island red!

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:44.600
- I want a Rhode Island red for me, all right? Two of 'em. Yeah.
- Rhode Island red, two?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.080
Now, y'all ain't planning on fucking
these chickens, are you?

01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:00.480
What the fuck are you getting at?
Do you fuck chickens?

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:05.320
Well, I have thought
about fucking some chickens before.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:08.440
If you want to have a good time
and you need some pussy,

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:12.720
you can cut that chicken's head off
and stick your dick in that ass of that chicken,

01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:16.760
and that damn chicken'll go crazy
on your ass and go...

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:22.040
Are you saying that I would cut off
a chicken's head, put my dick in it,

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:25.520
fuck it and go "Aaahhh"?

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:29.800
- You accusing me of fucking a chicken, motherfucker?
- No, I ain't call you a chicken fucker, but...

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:34.440
boy over there looks sexually frustrated and...
I don't approve of chicken fucking.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:38.480
- You hear what he called me, boss? - My
mistake. - He called me a fucking chicken fucker!

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.320
Go back and grab the fucking chickens, Clevon.

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:45.520
- Here's five.
- Appreciate it, thank y'all.

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:49.600
- He's a chicken fucker!
- That's all right, put it back there.

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:54.280
- Next time, we go someplace else.
- We ain't never buying chickens from him again, boss!

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.120
You inbred! Inbred!

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.320
Wolf J. Flywheel?

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:14.880
Get your motherfucking
pimp ass over here now.

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:19.680
Who are you talking about, man?
Who you talking to?

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.160
What's going on, Sheriff?

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.240
What'd we do?

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:29.400
What's going on, baby?

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:34.280
You and me, we're gonna have a little powwow
about a certain Captain Spaulding

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.960
and his merry band of assholes.

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:42.120
- Captain who?
- You know what I'm talking about, am I correct?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.440
Hey, Sheriff...
not in the middle of the street.

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:50.640
Ain't no sense
in getting crazy out here.

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:54.800
I don't like no motherfuckers
playing dumb with me.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.200
Now, let me tell you
the way it's gonna go down.

01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:02.040
You're gonna make sure all three of them dirtbags are present
and accounted for tonight at midnight. You got me Charlie boy?

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:05.920
You understand me?
Charlie! You got me?

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:16.000
What if I say no?

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:20.960
Then I ought to shoot your ass right fucking here
and now, you and that other ugly motherfucker.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.280
And I'm gonna forget this
conversation ever happened.

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:27.600
Tonight, midnight.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:34.600
It's a bad day to fuck with me, Charlie boy.

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:57.880
Hey, we got you this far. Shit. Without us, you'd still be swimming
around with your head up your ass.

01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:04.600
Hey, Chief, don't sweat it. Have a beer. It's
all going to work out to your satisfaction.

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:08.840
If I were you, I'd put the beer down
and keep your mind on business

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:11.360
before business jumps up
and bites you right in the ass.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:16.920
Don't worry about me, boss. They'll think goddamn King Kong
came down from Skull Island

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:20.200
and raped them and raped them
a new fucking asshole a new fucking asshole.

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:26.800
Hey, man, don't give me none of that cocky-ass-yard-bird-pumping-iron-
I'm-the-baddest-motherfucker-that-ever-lived horseshit.

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:31.520
That might work on some Johnny Redneck bail jumper,
but that don't mean shit to me.

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:36.000
Then I suggest you pick up the bat phone
and call some new motherfuckers in.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:39.480
- Dime a dozen, man. Fuck you.
- Fuck me? Fuck you, motherfucker!

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.400
Hey, hold it, hold it!
We gotta cool our shit, here!

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:50.760
Look, you hired the unholy two because
you wanted the best money could buy.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:54.680
Now, you got nothing to worry about.
We're gonna get the job done.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.760
Might talk a lot of shit,
but we will get the job done.

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:03.360
Here's the deal. I don't give a good God damn
what condition they're in.

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:07.600
I just want 'em alive so I can piss
in their face before they die.

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:11.640
You are one sick
fucking pirate.

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:15.920
- Hey, Billy Ray, your mama's on the phone.
- She owes me 14 bucks! Get down here.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.640
- Better keep a rope on that asshole.
- Yeah, I know.

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.840
Now look, G,
let me explain something to you.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.600
You've been using a bazooka
to exterminate three little roaches.

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:30.240
Now when you hunt roaches, you don't blow up your house.
You send in an exterminator so he can...

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:35.960
he crawls like a roach; He thinks like a roach;
He has a little roach mind...

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:42.560
Hey... you be careful or maybe you get
stepped on like a roach.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:05.080
I'm gonna tell you
something, brother, you have got it made.

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:12.120
Please, man, don't be fooled by the glamour.
I got trouble. Don't get me started.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:16.320
Trouble. What kinda trouble you got?
Man, you got hot and cold running pussy on tap!

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:21.680
Man, dealing with these greedy bitches
ain't all it's cracked up to be.

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:32.480
Brother, brother...

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.840
Go ahead.
Pick it up, pick it up.

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:43.760
- Man, I got the best, mmm.
- Take one for me too, man.

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:49.840
Hey, listen, you got a nose
like a vacuum cleaner.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.720
- Don't do up all my cocaine.
- Brother, would I do that to you?

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:58.600
No, you my brother...
- See? ... and I love you.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:09.560
- But I love my cocaine better. Fuck you.
- Oh, man, that's some cold shit right there.

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:15.840
Well, any port
in a fucking storm.

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:40.240
Charlie, brother, my brother...

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:47.680
I've been looking
for you, clown.

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:05.200
You gonna start the killing, you best start it right here.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.800
Make sure
I'm all the way dead,

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.480
or I will come back
and make you my bitch.

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:16.120
Bitch that, motherfucker.

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:27.760
Stop it! Stop it, motherfucker!

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:34.280
- Oh! Fuck! Oh!
- Get these scumbags in that truck.

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:40.640
It wasn't personal, brother.
Business is business, baby!

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:43.920
You asshole!

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:47.080
She's right, Charlie.
You are an asshole.

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:49.680
Why don't you get on
your fucking horse and ride?

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:53.680
All right, let's get
this freak show on the road.

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.880
What the fuck are you doing there?
Get the fuck up!

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:47.080
You know, I got to thank you all...

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:50.800
for helping me to understand
what my heritage is.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:55.440
You see, the Wydells,
they've always been vigilante justice.

01:22:55.800 --> 01:23:01.840
Now, my granddaddy, he rode with the likes
of Tom Horn, killing scum like you for a living.

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:06.560
We've always been devil slayers.
Wake up

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:10.720
See I tried to walk the line,

01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:13.440
but now I realize
there is no line.

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:18.640
We here, we are playing
on a level that most will never see.

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:21.200
I know my brother George,
he didn't see it.

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:26.120
Maybe he had a divine moment when his brains
hit the floor.

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:29.400
Yeah, well, maybe you will too.

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:37.880
I got over here some photographs of every missing person
within 100 miles of this shithole.

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:43.440
Valerie Green. Take a look at that.
She was beautiful, huh?

01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:46.600
Hell, anybody'd fuck her.

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:51.400
This is what she looked like when we pulled
her out of your little fucking torture shack.

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:53.760
She ain't so fuckable
anymore, huh?

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.760
Oh, yes, she is.

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:59.120
Well, then you get to have this as a souvenir.

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:14.720
- What about Mary Knowles, anybody?!
- That fucking bitch is mine.

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:18.280
No no, she was mine.
I did her, come on. Bring it onto me.

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:21.000
- Nah, she's all mine.
- Baby, shut the fuck up!

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:24.440
Baby, you want her,
you got her.

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:34.240
Come and get me,
motherfucker!

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:54.360
You see this picture?

01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:57.560
That's my brother George.

01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:01.000
Old George,
he was a good man.

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.800
Very trusting.

01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:07.200
I'm sure that's
what got him killed.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.560
Anyway, y'all take
a good look at that.

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:15.240
Because that's the reason
you gonna die tonight.

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:22.240
Yeah, I remember.
Stupid fuck just like you.

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:27.960
Come at me like some kinda matinee
fucking cowboy idol.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.240
All I had to do was point him
in a direction and there he goes,

01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:38.360
Officer Wyfucking-Dell
to the rescue.

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:50.000
And I hate fucking clowns.

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:05.000
I slayed me a devil
just the other day.

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:08.960
What you think? Huh?
See any you like?

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:14.000
You liar. Those photos ain't real.
There's no way you killed Mama.

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:18.640
No, Baby, they're real. Take a look at her right there.
Take a look at her eyes the way they are like that.

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:21.200
She's dead.

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:26.480
You know what I did? I took my knife and I stuck
it in there real good.

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:31.960
And I kinda twisted it a little bit.
Kinda like fucked her with it, you know?

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:35.400
Let me tell you, that old whore came before
I fucking took her miserable life.

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:39.560
You motherfucker.
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:42.400
You're gonna
fucking kill me?

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:46.440
Take a good, fucking look.

01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:54.600
You were her little angel, her little angel.
That's why I got something special in mind for you.

01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:01.720
Yeah? Well I can't fucking wait. If you want it, here it is.
Come and get it. Come on!

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.600
From delusion, lead me to truth.
From darkness, lead me to light.

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:14.360
From death, lead me to eternal life.

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:22.680
Hallelujah! Are you feeling it, brother?

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:43.280
It's time to end this little charade.

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:46.480
Look, you're free.

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:50.880
Run.
I said fucking run!

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:03.200
Burn well, motherfuckers.

01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:21.440
Come and get it!

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.160
I can hear you, Baby girl!

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:32.320
I can hear you!

01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:35.320
I got something here for ya!

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:38.360
What's that I smell?

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.560
It smells like rabbit!

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:23.200
It's me, Charlie, calm down.

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:28.240
- How could you do this? You ruined everything!
- Calm down, Baby! This is not the time.

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:31.520
- Gotta get you outta here.
- Daddy and Otis are in the house...

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:35.320
I'll get them, but first we gotta
get you someplace safe. Now, come on.

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:48.760
Cutter! Cutter, wake up!
Cutter, wake up!

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:53.080
Cutter! Wake the fuck up!
Wake the fuck up!

01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:59.760
- Wait in the car and I'll go get them.
- I want to go!

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:01.840
Oh, just get in! Go on.

01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:05.760
Stay put.

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:12.680
Charlie!

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:34.640
Run, Baby girl, run.

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:36.720
Run!

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:49.040
Lord, I bet that hurts. Man, I could hear
that bone shatter from right here.

01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:56.160
Hey, looky here,
I got something for you.

01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.200
Oh, yeah, I got
something for ya.

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:04.000
Hey, get up! Come on, I said get up!

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:12.080
- Fuck you.
- I don't know about you, but I sure wish I had a bullwhip for this occasion, but I found this. I reckon it'll do.

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:16.360
You like that?
You like the feeling of being helpless?

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:20.240
At the mercy of someone
who's as sadistic and deranged as you?!

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:23.240
Not such a fucking party, is it?
Doesn't make it you feel proud?

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:25.840
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me? Oh, no.

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:28.960
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:14.000
Tiny.

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:21.280
Daddy and Otis are
still in the house. Go get 'em.

01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:43.760
Tiny! Tiny!
Come on, man!

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:09.720
Daddy!

01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:48.480
You sure about this?

01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:54.160
We'll come back for you.
