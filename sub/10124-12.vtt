WEBVTT

00:07.300 --> 00:10.567
GEORGE, YOU'D THINK
A MAN OF YOUR STATURE

00:10.567 --> 00:12.033
COULD FIND
SOME UNDERLING

00:12.033 --> 00:13.000
TO DO THIS BRAINLESS
GRUNT WORK.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.300
THERE YOU ARE,
MR. TURNER.

00:15.300 --> 00:16.467
MAKE ME PROUD.

00:16.467 --> 00:19.834
HOW DID I NOT
SEE THAT COMING?

00:19.834 --> 00:20.834
AH.

00:20.834 --> 00:22.033
"TURNAROUND DANCE," HUH?

00:22.033 --> 00:24.500
THE YOUNG LADIES
ASK THE YOUNG MEN.

00:24.500 --> 00:27.567
SO THE GUYS ARE
SWEATING IT OUT, HUH?

00:27.567 --> 00:30.600
POOR DOPES. I'M GLAD
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.133
GOOD MORNING, GEORGE,
JONATHAN.

00:33.133 --> 00:34.200
HI, KAT.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.767
MISS THOMPKINS,
I TRUST YOU'RE AVAILABLE

00:35.767 --> 00:37.467
TO CHAPERON
THIS FRIDAY?

00:37.467 --> 00:38.667
HAVE I A CHOICE?

00:38.667 --> 00:39.600
NO.

00:39.600 --> 00:40.667
CAN'T WAIT.

00:40.667 --> 00:43.100
FEEL FREE
TO INVITE A GENTLEMEN.

00:43.100 --> 00:46.500
AFTER ALL, IT IS
A TURNAROUND DANCE.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.400
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.000
THANKS.

00:53.567 --> 00:55.767
JONATHAN.

00:55.767 --> 00:56.734
YES?

00:56.734 --> 00:59.900
A LITTLE HIGHER
ON THE RIGHT.

01:04.967 --> 01:06.500
TURNAROUND DANCE, HUH?

01:06.500 --> 01:07.667
GIRLS ASK THE GUYS.

01:07.667 --> 01:08.967
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ME.

01:08.967 --> 01:12.133
IT'S ABOUT TIME
THE GIRLS HAD
TO WORRY AND SWEAT

01:12.133 --> 01:15.867
AND WRITE A LIST OF
CONVERSATION TOPICS
ON THEIR HANDS.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.233
YOU DO THAT?

01:17.233 --> 01:19.033
NO. NEVER.

01:19.033 --> 01:20.900
I'M JUST GLAD
THE PRESSURE'S OFF.

01:20.900 --> 01:23.100
WE JUST GET TO
SIT BACK AND WAIT.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.367
YOU THINK
THE PRESSURE'S OFF?

01:25.367 --> 01:26.967
DREAM ON, GIRLS.

01:26.967 --> 01:28.233
WAIT. COME BACK.
WHAT?

01:28.233 --> 01:32.467
A TURNAROUND DANCE
TELLS YOU WHERE YOU STAND.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.767
THE GIRL THAT ASKS YOU
TELLS YOU WHO YOU ARE.

01:34.767 --> 01:37.000
WHO ARE YOU
IF NOBODY ASKS?

01:37.000 --> 01:39.200
THEN YOU'RE YOU.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.600
HOW DO YOU GET
A COOL GIRL?

01:41.600 --> 01:43.133
POSITIONING.

01:43.133 --> 01:44.500
HANG NEAR HER LOCKER.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.200
STAY IN
HER DIRECT VISION.

01:46.200 --> 01:49.467
IF SHE CAN'T SEE YOU,
SHE CAN'T ASK YOU.

01:49.467 --> 01:51.700
REMEMBER--POSITION.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.100
HEY, JACKIE,
WHERE YOU HEADED?

01:55.100 --> 01:58.133
YOU KNOW, I WAS
JUST GOING THAT WAY.

01:58.133 --> 02:02.000
O.K. POSITIONING.
WE'RE IN A MAIN HALLWAY

02:02.000 --> 02:05.367
BETWEEN A BATHROOM
AND A DRINKING FOUNTAIN.

02:05.367 --> 02:06.967
THERE'S GOOD
FOOT TRAFFIC.

02:06.967 --> 02:09.400
ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO IT.

02:13.767 --> 02:14.934
SHAWN, COME ON.
POSITIONING.

02:14.934 --> 02:18.367
HOW DO YOU EXPECT
TO GET ASKED OUT
THAT WAY?

02:18.367 --> 02:22.500
SHAWN, WOULD YOU GO
TO THE TURNAROUND DANCE
WITH ME?

02:22.500 --> 02:25.000
BECKY, HI.
SURE, I'LL GO.

02:25.000 --> 02:25.934
8:00?

02:25.934 --> 02:28.233
I'LL WEAR
SOMETHING SEXY.

02:32.567 --> 02:34.033
BECKY SHULTZ.

02:34.033 --> 02:36.000
I'M IMPRESSED, CHUM.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.934
SHE'S, LIKE,
THE THIRD COOLEST GIRL
IN OUR GRADE.

02:38.934 --> 02:42.600
YOU KNOW, THE PRESSURE'S
TOTALLY OFF YOU...

02:42.600 --> 02:45.133
AND ALL ON ME.

02:45.133 --> 02:46.100
O.K., O.K.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.100
POSITIONING.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.367
POSITIONING.

02:48.367 --> 02:51.100
HI, CORY, SHAWN.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

02:51.100 --> 02:55.300
OH, I...WE'RE JUST
STANDING AND BEING HERE...

02:55.300 --> 02:59.000
AND HOPING A GIRL
ASKS YOU TO THE DANCE?

02:59.000 --> 03:00.300
WELL, I'M NOT GOING.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.600
MY ONLY HOPE.

03:03.667 --> 03:05.100
I MEAN, WHY?

03:05.100 --> 03:08.734
A TURNAROUND DANCE IMPLIES
THAT ALL THE OTHER TIMES

03:08.734 --> 03:10.700
ONLY THE BOYS
CAN DO THE ASKING.

03:10.700 --> 03:12.834
THAT'S DESTRUCTIVE
GENDER-BIASED THINKING.

03:12.834 --> 03:14.367
WE HAVE
TO GET BEYOND THAT.

03:14.367 --> 03:15.867
WHY?

03:15.867 --> 03:18.967
BESIDES, THAT WEEKEND
MY DADDY'S TAKING ME
TO NEW YORK

03:18.967 --> 03:20.700
FOR CHRISTMAS SHOPPING.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.133
I'LL SEE YOU
IN CLASS.

03:22.133 --> 03:25.100
NOW I'VE GOT TO FIND
AN ABOVE-AVERAGE GIRL

03:25.100 --> 03:27.600
WHO'S INTO DESTRUCTIVE
GENDER-BIASED THINKING.

03:30.500 --> 03:31.500
HOW ABOUT ALLISON?

03:31.500 --> 03:33.300
ALLISON CHEEVER?
GET REAL.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.400
JUST BECAUSE
SHE'S THE COOLEST GIRL,

03:35.400 --> 03:37.200
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE'D ASK ME?

03:37.200 --> 03:40.600
IF A BOMB
KILLED EVERY BOY
IN THIS SCHOOL,

03:40.600 --> 03:44.200
SHE'D GO WITH
THE MOST POPULAR
DEAD GUY.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.600
[BELL RINGS]

03:45.600 --> 03:47.367
COME ON, MAN.
WE GOT CLASS.

03:47.367 --> 03:48.300
GO.

03:48.300 --> 03:49.300
LEARN.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.867
MY PLACE IS HERE.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.500
CORY.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.734
YES?

04:14.734 --> 04:17.300
WOULD YOU GO
TO THE TURNAROUND DANCE
WITH ME?

04:17.300 --> 04:22.367
YES, I'D LOVE
TO GO WITH YOU.

04:22.367 --> 04:23.200
YES?

04:23.200 --> 04:25.667
YOU SAID YES?

04:32.600 --> 04:34.200
WHERE'D YOU COME FROM?

04:34.200 --> 04:35.834
I ASKED YOU,
AND YOU SAID YES.

04:35.834 --> 04:39.367
CORY MATTHEWS AND I
ARE GOING TO THE DANCE.

04:39.367 --> 04:41.867
AN AVERAGE GUY
SAID YES TO ME.

04:49.133 --> 04:53.700
INGRID, YOU THINK
I SAID I'D GO WITH YOU.

04:53.700 --> 04:56.867
WELL, YOU'RE GOING
TO THINK THIS IS
PRETTY AMAZING,

04:56.867 --> 04:58.500
BUT THAT WASN'T ME.

04:58.500 --> 05:01.300
THERE'S THIS GUY
WHO LOOKS LIKE ME
AND SOUNDS LIKE ME,

05:01.300 --> 05:02.300
BUT HE'S NOT ME.

05:02.300 --> 05:03.834
I REPORTED HIM
TO THE POLICE,

05:03.834 --> 05:07.300
BUT THEY KEEP
ARRESTING ME.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.834
OH, YEAH. THAT'LL WORK.

05:08.834 --> 05:10.500
DAD.

05:10.500 --> 05:13.967
IT'S NOT ME, JUST A GUY
WHO LOOKS LIKE ME.

05:13.967 --> 05:16.767
WE'RE BOTH WONDERING
WHAT THE TWO OF YOU
ARE UP TO.

05:19.233 --> 05:21.133
O.K., LOOK.
THIS GIRL INGRID,

05:21.133 --> 05:24.567
SHE INVITED ME
TO THE TURNAROUND DANCE,

05:24.567 --> 05:26.300
AND I DON'T WANT TO GO.

05:26.300 --> 05:29.133
I WANT TO GO,
JUST NOT WITH HER.

05:29.133 --> 05:30.300
YOU SAID YES TO HER.

05:30.300 --> 05:33.400
YEAH, BUT MY WHOLE
SOCIAL STANDING
THIS YEAR

05:33.400 --> 05:36.233
DEPENDS ON WHICH GIRL
I'M THERE WITH.

05:36.233 --> 05:38.667
OH! THAT'S DIFFERENT.

05:38.667 --> 05:39.800
I UNDERSTAND.

05:39.800 --> 05:43.367
GO WITH THE GIRL
YOU SAID YES TO.

05:45.867 --> 05:48.967
ERIC, I DON'T WANT
TO HURT INGRID

05:48.967 --> 05:50.800
'CAUSE SHE'S
A REALLY SWEET GIRL.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.100
ENOUGH ABOUT HER.
GET ME OUT OF THIS DATE!

05:53.100 --> 05:54.400
YOU HEARD DAD.

05:54.400 --> 05:58.600
OH, PLEASE. HE'S OLD.
HE'S OUT OF TOUCH.

05:58.600 --> 06:02.600
I MEAN, THE LAST GIRL
HE DATED WAS MOM.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.400
NO, NO, NO, CORY.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.400
YOU HAVE TO GO
WITH INGRID.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.834
YOU BAIL, IT'S ALL
OVER FOR YOU.

06:08.834 --> 06:12.400
WHY? IT'S ONE GIRL,
ONE DATE.

06:12.400 --> 06:16.500
YOU DUMP ONE GIRL,
THEY'LL ALL KNOW
AND THEY'LL HATE YOU.

06:16.500 --> 06:20.700
REMEMBER--WOMEN ARE IN
CONSTANT COMMUNICATION
WITH EACH OTHER.

06:20.700 --> 06:22.967
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

06:22.967 --> 06:26.500
DID YOU ENJOY
THE VEGETARIAN CHILI
MOM MADE

06:26.500 --> 06:27.900
AS MUCH AS I DID?

06:27.900 --> 06:32.367
SOMETIMES I THINK
WE TAKE OUR GREAT MOM
FOR GRANTED.

06:32.367 --> 06:35.600
COULD WE STICK
TO MY PROBLEM
FOR A SECOND?

06:35.600 --> 06:36.967
YES. YOUR PROBLEM.

06:36.967 --> 06:40.000
YOUR PROBLEM IS
THE INTERNATIONAL
WOMEN'S NETWORK.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.700
YOU BLOW OFF THIS GIRL,

06:41.700 --> 06:44.200
EVERYBODY ON-LINE
WILL KNOW TOMORROW.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.233
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

06:45.233 --> 06:47.300
YOU COULD BE RIGHT.
THEN AGAIN...

06:47.300 --> 06:50.033
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU LIKED MY CHILI.

06:50.033 --> 06:53.233
WHAT CAN I GET
FOR DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT?

06:53.233 --> 06:56.200
AND BAD NEWS, IT
TRAVELS EVEN FASTER.

06:57.967 --> 06:59.800
SHAW'S PLAY <i>PYGMALION </i>

06:59.800 --> 07:02.033
IS FILLED
WITH STRONG OPINIONS
ABOUT CLASS PREJUDICE.

07:02.033 --> 07:05.000
YOU GUYS AGREE
OR DISAGREE?

07:05.000 --> 07:10.033
WOW. I DIDN'T KNOW
THEY WERE TAKING
THE CLASS PICTURE TODAY.

07:10.033 --> 07:12.400
HOW YOU SPEAK,
HOW YOU WALK

07:12.400 --> 07:15.233
AFFECTS HOW YOU'RE
GOING TO DO IN LIFE.

07:15.233 --> 07:16.500
YOU GUYS BELIEVE THAT?

07:16.500 --> 07:21.800
WHAT IF, DAY ONE, I WALKED
INTO THIS CLASSROOM...

07:21.800 --> 07:23.300
HOW YOU DOIN'?
I'M MR. TURNER.

07:23.300 --> 07:27.100
I'LL BE LEARNIN' YOUSE GUYS
SOME GOOD ENGLISH, O.K.?

07:27.100 --> 07:28.300
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK?

07:28.300 --> 07:31.100
I'D HAVE A SHOT
AT AN "A."

07:31.100 --> 07:33.400
HOW YOU SPEAK,
HOW YOU LOOK

07:33.400 --> 07:37.000
AFFECTS PEOPLE'S PERCEPTIONS
OF WHO YOU ARE.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.500
[BELL RINGS]

07:38.500 --> 07:39.734
READ PEOPLE.
<i>PYGMALION, </i>

07:39.734 --> 07:42.667
DON'T MAKE ME
DO THIS AGAIN TOMORROW.

07:42.667 --> 07:44.967
CORY, YOU'RE
GOING TO LOVE ME.

07:44.967 --> 07:47.834
I CAN MAKE YOUR DATE
WITH INGRID WORK.

07:47.834 --> 07:50.500
IT'S O.K. I'VE ACCEPTED
MY AVERAGE FATE.

07:50.500 --> 07:54.200
YOU'D BE HAPPY TO GO
TO THE DANCE WITH HER

07:54.200 --> 07:55.033
IF SHE WAS COOL.

07:55.033 --> 07:56.967
YEAH,
BUT SHE'S NOT COOL.

07:56.967 --> 07:58.967
SO WE MAKE HER COOL.

07:58.967 --> 08:00.100
IS THAT POSSIBLE?

08:00.100 --> 08:02.000
IT'S IN THE <i>PYG </i>PLAY.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.834
WE CHANGE HER CLOTHES,
HER HAIR,

08:04.834 --> 08:06.233
HER WHOLE LOOK.

08:06.233 --> 08:08.967
WE'RE GUYS.
WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT GIRLS' CLOTHES?

08:08.967 --> 08:13.500
NOT MUCH, BUT I'M THINKING
BECKY SHULTZ KNOWS A LOT.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.767
YOU THINK SHE'D HELP US?

08:14.767 --> 08:17.033
SHE ASKED ME OUT,
AND I SAID YES,

08:17.033 --> 08:19.934
SO I COULD ASK HER
FOR SOMETHING,

08:19.934 --> 08:20.967
AND SHE'D SAY YES.

08:20.967 --> 08:25.834
YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO WASTE IT ON THIS?

08:27.500 --> 08:28.767
HI, KAT.

08:28.767 --> 08:29.734
HI, JONATHAN.

08:29.734 --> 08:30.867
ANY PLANS
FOR THE WEEKEND?

08:30.867 --> 08:32.200
ARE YOU LEAVING TOWN?

08:32.200 --> 08:35.033
ACTUALLY, GEORGE
HAS ME CHAPERONING
THE TURNAROUND DANCE.

08:35.033 --> 08:39.100
OH, RIGHT, YEAH,
WHERE THE GIRLS
ASK THE GUYS.

08:39.100 --> 08:42.667
AND THE GUYS
SWEAT IT OUT WAITING.

08:42.667 --> 08:43.567
POOR DOPES.

08:43.567 --> 08:45.400
YEAH. POOR DOPES.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.200
POOR, POOR DOPES.

08:50.667 --> 08:53.467
TRY A HAMMER,
MR. TURNER.

08:54.934 --> 08:58.400
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
INGRID WITH THIS HAIR?

08:58.400 --> 08:59.400
AND THESE LIPS.

08:59.400 --> 09:02.233
BRING THIS UPSTAIRS
TO INGRID AND BECKY.

09:02.233 --> 09:04.200
SHE'S SCARY-LOOKING.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.700
BOYS LIKE THAT.

09:05.700 --> 09:07.834
BUT BOYS
SHOULDN'T LIKE THAT.

09:07.834 --> 09:09.500
LOOK AT THESE WOMEN.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.500
THEY'RE STARVED.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.367
THEY'VE HAD LIFTS
AND IMPLANTS

09:12.367 --> 09:16.000
TO MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE SOME
MALE FANTASY IMAGE OF WOMEN.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.567
WHERE DID YOU FIND
PICTURES LIKE THESE?

09:18.567 --> 09:21.767
IN THE MAGAZINES
ON YOUR NIGHTSTAND.

09:21.767 --> 09:23.233
OH.

09:23.233 --> 09:26.000
YOU DIDN'T OPEN THE DRAWER,
DID YOU?

09:28.500 --> 09:30.367
HERE SHE COMES.

09:32.667 --> 09:35.667
WOW. SHE LOOKS
JUST LIKE BECKY.

09:35.667 --> 09:38.367
I AM BECKY.

09:38.367 --> 09:39.567
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

09:39.567 --> 09:43.934

09:51.300 --> 09:52.200
WHAT?
WHAT?

09:52.200 --> 09:54.467
WE MISSED.
IT DOESN'T WORK.

09:54.467 --> 09:56.567

I LOOKED PRETTY.

09:56.567 --> 09:57.700
YEAH. YOU DO.

09:57.700 --> 10:00.200
SHAWN, WHAT'S WITH YOU?
SHE'S GORGEOUS.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.500
FINE. WHAT DOES THAT
GIVE YOU?

10:02.500 --> 10:04.000
PRETTY MUCH
EVERYTHING?

10:04.000 --> 10:06.100
CORY, WE'RE GOING
FOR COOL HERE.

10:06.100 --> 10:09.834
COOL IS MORE THAN LOOKS.
IT'S AN ATTITUDE.

10:09.834 --> 10:11.100
LOOK. THIS GIRL'S EXOTIC.

10:11.100 --> 10:13.000
THERE'S SOMETHING
MYSTERIOUS ABOUT HER.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.300
SHE LOOKS LIKE HER NAME
WOULD BE AMARETTO

10:16.300 --> 10:18.400
OR FRANGELICA

THAT'S O.K.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.200
IT WAS FUN
FOR A WHILE.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.767
UNTIL I HIT
THE WATER.

19:24.767 --> 19:28.000
NO, SEE, WE DIDN'T
DO IT FOR YOU.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.200
WE DID IT FOR ME

19:29.200 --> 19:32.800
SO I COULD HAVE A DATE
EVERYONE THOUGHT WAS COOL.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.200
YEAH, I KNEW THAT.

19:34.200 --> 19:37.567
THAT'S WHY I
DIDN'T FEEL BAD
ABOUT DUMPING YOU.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.000
UNTIL NOW.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.734
SORRY.

19:40.734 --> 19:42.767
SORRY.

19:44.367 --> 19:45.600
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?

19:45.600 --> 19:47.400
WE MIGHT'VE ACTUALLY
HAD FUN TONIGHT

19:47.400 --> 19:50.767
IF WE'D JUST
COME HERE TOGETHER
AS OURSELVES.

19:50.767 --> 19:52.500
YEAH, YOU
MIGHT BE RIGHT.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.667
I GUESS
WE'LL NEVER KNOW.

19:54.667 --> 19:56.133
GUESS NOT.

19:56.133 --> 19:57.767
UNLESS...

19:57.767 --> 19:59.567
WELL, I MEAN,
THERE'S ALWAYS
NEXT YEAR.

19:59.567 --> 20:02.233
HEY, THERE'S
STILL THIS YEAR.

20:02.233 --> 20:04.100
YEAH.
IT DOESN'T MATTER

20:04.100 --> 20:05.767
IF OTHER PEOPLE
THINK WE'RE COOL.

20:05.767 --> 20:07.800
WE KNOW WHO WE ARE.

20:07.800 --> 20:12.033
ARE YOU INGRID,
THE GIRL THAT JUMPED
IN THE POOL?

20:12.033 --> 20:13.900
THAT WOULD BE ME.

20:13.900 --> 20:15.567
I THINK
YOU'RE SO COOL.

20:15.567 --> 20:17.100
WANT TO DANCE?

20:17.100 --> 20:18.000
YEAH, SURE.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.367
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

20:19.367 --> 20:21.467
WHAT ABOUT KNOWING
WHO WE ARE?

20:21.467 --> 20:22.734
GIVE ME A BREAK.

20:25.033 --> 20:26.900
HEY, JUST HEARD
ABOUT YOU AND INGRID.

20:28.467 --> 20:30.100
THE WOMEN'S NETWORK,
RIGHT?

20:30.100 --> 20:33.367
NO, ACTUALLY,
I WAS STANDING
RIGHT HERE.

20:33.367 --> 20:34.600
SO WHERE'S BECKY?

20:34.600 --> 20:37.100
IN THE GIRLS' ROOM,
FOR SIX HOURS
LIKE ALWAYS.

20:37.100 --> 20:38.567
HEY, GIRLS.

20:38.567 --> 20:41.700
ERIC, NOT NOW, O.K.?
ANYTIME BUT NOW.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.100
'CAUSE YOU GOT
DUMPED TWICE?

20:43.100 --> 20:44.100
THREE TIMES.

20:44.100 --> 20:46.467
WOW!

20:46.467 --> 20:47.767
I DON'T SEE
YOUR DATE.

20:47.767 --> 20:48.767
WHERE'S JACLYN?

20:48.767 --> 20:49.834
FUNNY THING.

20:49.834 --> 20:51.934
HER OLD BOYFRIEND
CAME INTO TOWN.

20:51.934 --> 20:53.500
THINGS AREN'T OVER
BETWEEN THEM.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.200
SHE HOPES
I'LL UNDERSTAND.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.200
DO YOU?

20:56.200 --> 20:57.467
I'M COMPLETELY
RELAXED ABOUT IT.

20:57.467 --> 20:59.467
WANT A PICTURE
TO REMEMBER THE DANCE?

20:59.467 --> 21:01.700
DROP DEAD!

21:01.700 --> 21:03.734
YEAH, YOU'RE REAL
RELAXED, ERIC.

21:03.734 --> 21:05.467
NO, WAIT, WAIT,
COME BACK.

21:05.467 --> 21:06.867
TAKE A PICTURE,

21:06.867 --> 21:09.667
A PICTURE OF THE THREE
COOLEST GUYS AT THE DANCE.

21:09.667 --> 21:10.867
SITTING AT
THE LOSERS' TABLE.

21:10.867 --> 21:13.500
SMILE NOW. IN 2O YEARS,
IF ANYONE ASKS,

21:13.500 --> 21:14.867
OUR DATES WERE
IN THE BATHROOM.

21:14.867 --> 21:16.300
MINE REALLY IS.

21:16.300 --> 21:17.934
HA HA,
SHUT UP.

21:17.934 --> 21:18.934
SAY CHEESE.

21:18.934 --> 21:20.500
YOU GOT TO SAY
DUMPED.

21:20.500 --> 21:21.500
DUMPED.

21:21.500 --> 21:22.500
DUMPED.

21:22.500 --> 21:23.667
CHEESE.

21:39.500 --> 21:42.100
HEY, ERIC,
LOOK AT THIS.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.100
UH-OH.

21:43.100 --> 21:44.834
WHY DON'T YOU GO
UPSTAIRS?

21:44.834 --> 21:45.834
WHAT?

21:45.834 --> 21:47.567
THERE'S NOTHING HERE
YOU NEED TO SEE.

21:47.567 --> 21:51.000
JUST GET ON UPSTAIRS.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.400
OH, YOU GUYS
WERE GOING TO HAVE
SUCH A NICE EVENING.

21:53.400 --> 21:56.400
MAYBE IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

22:04.133 --> 22:06.000
AHH.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.700
YOU ALL WARM
AND SNUGGLY?

22:08.700 --> 22:10.400
YEAH, DON'T STOP.

22:10.400 --> 22:14.000
YOUR TURN TO DO ME.
I'VE BEEN DOING YOU FOR...

22:14.000 --> 22:16.834
SIX HOURS?

22:16.834 --> 22:18.934
10 MORE MINUTES.
