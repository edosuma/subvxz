00:06.040 --> 00:08.440
(bright, happy music)

00:08.442 --> 00:11.643
(electricity buzzing)

00:13.047 --> 00:16.315
(phone dinging)

00:16.317 --> 00:19.118
(phone dinging)

00:20.221 --> 00:25.290
¶ I'm gonna live my life
just like a holiday ¶

00:26.594 --> 00:31.663
¶ I will not work, no,
not for another day ¶

00:34.268 --> 00:39.338
¶ Since I met you, I will
not waste a single day ¶

00:40.374 --> 00:44.343
¶ From now on, my life's a
holiday ¶

00:44.345 --> 00:47.046
(text dinging)

00:48.549 --> 00:51.383
¶ The wind it's cold outside, ¶

00:51.385 --> 00:54.720
¶ And a gloomy sky ¶

00:54.722 --> 00:57.489
¶ But inside of my mind, ¶

00:57.491 --> 01:01.093
¶ Oh, the sun is shining ¶

01:02.530 --> 01:03.395
- Zoe?

01:03.397 --> 01:04.263
Hey.

01:04.265 --> 01:05.130
- Hi.

01:05.132 --> 01:05.798
- Hey, how you doing?

01:05.800 --> 01:06.665
- Good, good, oh.

01:06.667 --> 01:07.599
(kiss smacking)

01:07.601 --> 01:08.467
- European.

01:08.469 --> 01:09.334
- Yeah.

01:09.336 --> 01:10.552
- Sorry I'm late.

01:10.553 --> 01:11.769
- That's all right, I just got
here.

01:11.772 --> 01:12.704
- Cool.

01:14.108 --> 01:15.274
So, finally.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.409
- Yeah, you were tough to get a
hold of.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.277
- Yeah.

01:18.279 --> 01:19.478
- Do you live far away?

01:19.480 --> 01:21.413
- No, just a couple miles away.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.315
- Oh cool, yeah, me too.

01:23.317 --> 01:24.550
- Great.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.251
- Cool.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.019
- Tickets?

01:27.020 --> 01:27.786
- Yes.
- Let's go get' em.

01:27.788 --> 01:28.720
Okay.

01:30.524 --> 01:34.159
¶ Since I met you, I will
not waste a single day ¶

01:34.161 --> 01:35.360
- Hello.

01:35.362 --> 01:38.197
Hi, just picking up
tickets I booked online.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.399
I got them here, actually.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.267
Hang on a second.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.368
- There's no signal in here,

01:43.370 --> 01:45.737
you're gonna have to go outside.

01:45.739 --> 01:46.605
- Okay yeah.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.473
Just give me a second.

01:47.475 --> 01:48.407
- Okay.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.611
Long night, huh?

01:55.483 --> 01:56.415
- Yeah.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.651
(hand tapping)

01:59.653 --> 02:02.254
(soft music)

02:04.391 --> 02:07.426
- Crossword, yeah that's hard.

02:07.428 --> 02:08.360
- Yep.

02:17.738 --> 02:18.637
- Found it.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.305
Voila.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.740
- Yeah, you're good.

02:21.742 --> 02:22.841
- Great.

02:22.843 --> 02:25.811
We'll also take a medium
popcorn,

02:25.813 --> 02:27.746
and what do you want to drink?

02:27.748 --> 02:29.231
- Water's fine.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.715
- Make that two waters, please.

02:30.718 --> 02:34.153
- No more popcorn, we're closed.

02:34.155 --> 02:36.489
- What do you mean no more
popcorn?

02:36.490 --> 02:38.824
There's a machine with a
bunch of popcorn inside of it.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.459
Can't you just serve it to us?

02:40.461 --> 02:41.793
- See the clock?

02:42.796 --> 02:43.795
It's 10:15.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.299
- I can't see a clock.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.601
- No popcorn after 10.

02:49.603 --> 02:50.536
Rules.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.572
- Right.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.474
It's not a gin and tonic.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.209
It's popcorn.

02:57.211 --> 02:59.811
- Jerry, can I sell the popcorn?

03:03.350 --> 03:04.816
Jerry says no popcorn.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.385
That's a negative.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.719
Rules are rules.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.656
- I didn't hear his answer
clearly.

03:10.658 --> 03:11.790
Are you sure?

03:12.626 --> 03:14.443
- Nevermind.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.261
Haven't you heard? Popcorn's
dangerous after 10.

03:16.263 --> 03:17.763
What are you thinking?

03:17.765 --> 03:19.898
- Who knows what I was thinking.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.201
(machine whirring)

03:22.203 --> 03:24.403
(sighing)

03:27.808 --> 03:30.609
(cups plopping)

03:37.484 --> 03:39.518
I don't know what to say.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.353
- Thank you.

03:41.355 --> 03:43.222
- Enjoy your movie.

03:43.224 --> 03:44.523
- So many questions.

03:44.525 --> 03:47.259
Who's Jerry, where's the clock?

03:51.498 --> 03:53.899
(soft music)

03:58.472 --> 04:00.672
I think we're in this row.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.875
- Yeah, 'cause there's
so many people in here.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.978
I don't care.
- One, two, three, four.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.579
Yeah.
- Do you mind?

04:07.581 --> 04:09.414
- [Man] Just in case
someone else sits there.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.282
- If you prefer, we can go back
there.

04:10.284 --> 04:11.717
- No, no, that's fine.

04:11.719 --> 04:12.618
You're fine.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.619
We're fine.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.790
(seats creaking)

04:23.564 --> 04:25.597
I've been looking forward
to this movie for a while.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.799
- Oh yeah?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.000
- Yeah, I saw the
trailer three months ago.

04:28.002 --> 04:29.334
- Cool.

04:29.336 --> 04:30.736
- Big DeNiro fan.

04:30.738 --> 04:31.670
- Yeah.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.840
Hathaway's pretty clutch.

04:34.842 --> 04:35.874
- Clutch?

04:35.876 --> 04:38.177
- Yeah.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.479
- I don't know this word,
clutch.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.282
(body thudding)

04:44.418 --> 04:45.384
(drink gurgling)

04:45.386 --> 04:47.886
- Where did he get the popcorn?

04:47.888 --> 04:50.922
- Just stay leave it, just leave
it.

04:50.924 --> 04:51.790
- I need you to clarify.

04:51.792 --> 04:52.658
I'm gonna go back.

04:52.660 --> 04:53.525
- Look.

04:53.527 --> 04:54.393
- Why?

04:54.395 --> 04:55.427
- Just leave it be.

04:55.428 --> 04:56.460
He needs it more than you do,
okay?

04:56.463 --> 04:57.629
- Oh.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.965
- Wow, that's horrible.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.634
(popcorn crunching)

05:02.636 --> 05:03.602
- I'm gonna--

05:03.603 --> 05:04.569
- No, look, the movie's about to
start.

05:04.571 --> 05:05.637
- Seriously?

05:05.639 --> 05:09.875
All right, fine, sure,
I'll just have a water.

05:09.877 --> 05:10.976
I love water.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.311
- Me, too.

05:12.313 --> 05:13.612
- Mmm.

05:13.614 --> 05:16.481
(drink gurgling)

05:20.487 --> 05:22.988
(man laughing)

05:27.995 --> 05:28.927
- What?

05:30.564 --> 05:31.830
- There's so many other seats.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.032
(hushing)

05:39.540 --> 05:40.405
- Just wait, just leave it.

05:40.407 --> 05:43.008
(seat creaking)

05:49.049 --> 05:52.117
(popcorn crunching)

06:01.895 --> 06:04.930
(film blaring)

06:04.932 --> 06:06.631
(seat creaking)

06:06.633 --> 06:09.034
(soft music)

06:18.078 --> 06:21.413
(projector whirring)

06:24.918 --> 06:27.119
(sighing)

06:30.824 --> 06:33.692
(water gurgling)

06:53.747 --> 06:54.913
Are you enjoying the movie so
far?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.515
- Yes, it's good.

06:58.819 --> 07:02.587
- That transvestite
DeNiro twist was weird.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.189
Didn't see that sex change
happening.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.857
- No, it was cool.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.796
(chuckling)

07:10.798 --> 07:13.598
(lips smacking)

07:16.637 --> 07:19.204
(seat creaking)

07:19.206 --> 07:22.541
- I just want to watch the
credits.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.109
Got a friend of mine.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.844
He's a dog handler.

07:27.581 --> 07:28.513
- Sure.

07:28.515 --> 07:29.948
- I just wanna see his name.

07:29.950 --> 07:33.185
(seat creaking)

07:33.187 --> 07:35.787
(soft music)

07:44.598 --> 07:45.597
It's just coming up.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.199
- No, it's fine.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.800
- Also, it might be like,
one of them deleted scenes.

07:48.802 --> 07:49.668
- Mmm.

07:49.670 --> 07:50.535
- Always happens.

07:50.537 --> 07:51.970
- Yeah sure, sure.

07:54.007 --> 07:57.576
- Must be a different film, I
guess.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.244
- Good to go?

07:59.246 --> 08:01.580
- Yeah, we're good to go.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.917
Did you lose something?

08:05.919 --> 08:07.686
- My phone?

08:07.688 --> 08:08.620
Oh.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.956
(seat creaking)

08:10.958 --> 08:14.526
- Maybe it dropped out
when you were snoozing.

08:14.528 --> 08:15.927
- Okay, I was thinking,

08:15.929 --> 08:18.163
and I can't think when
it's too bright, so.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.030
- Gotcha.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.065
- I was resting my eyes.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.199
- Yeah, yeah.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.536
(whispering)

08:24.538 --> 08:26.004
(seat creaking)

08:26.006 --> 08:27.072
Ow.
- Ooo, careful.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.574
(sighing)

08:29.576 --> 08:31.076
Did you like the film?

08:31.078 --> 08:32.811
- Come on, I mean, who buys the
story

08:32.813 --> 08:35.614
of an 80-year-old grandpa who
gets an unpaid internship,

08:35.616 --> 08:37.883
and then still gets to
bang the massage therapist?

08:37.885 --> 08:39.818
I mean, completely logical.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.086
(humming)

08:41.088 --> 08:43.622
- Did you check your jacket?

08:45.826 --> 08:49.060
I thought there was a
lot of hope in the movie.

08:49.062 --> 08:52.197
I mean, that you can
still get the masseuse

08:52.199 --> 08:54.299
even though you're 80.

08:54.301 --> 08:57.168
- Hmm, that's fair, I can see
it.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.638
Oh here.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.839
- Oh, oh good.

09:01.909 --> 09:02.841
- Great.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.744
That was fun.
- Yeah.

09:05.746 --> 09:06.645
- Ready to go?

09:06.647 --> 09:07.679
I gotta get going.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.314
- Yeah, I've gotta go as well.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.182
I haven't fed my dog.

09:12.319 --> 09:15.787
I forgot to, didn't have
time, and feed the plants.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.589
- Yeah, I really need to pee,
so.

09:17.591 --> 09:18.924
Let's go.
- Pee away, yeah.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.026
Not here, but yeah.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.827
I think let's leave.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.196
(sighing)

09:25.198 --> 09:26.865
- Here, in case you get bored.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.667
You know what, I'll just hang
onto it.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.302
- Okay.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.936
I'll meet you in the lobby.

09:31.937 --> 09:33.570
- Cool, I'll just be a minute.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.308
(water splashing)

09:38.011 --> 09:39.778
(towel rustling)

09:39.780 --> 09:41.646
(sighing)

09:41.648 --> 09:42.581
He's cute.

09:43.817 --> 09:44.950
Ish.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.352
(soft music)

09:48.221 --> 09:50.088
(groaning)

09:50.089 --> 09:51.956
This is the last time I date
anybody from a frickin' app.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.408
Oh, my God.

09:53.409 --> 09:54.858
But what is up with that stupid
accent.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.995
I do not why people are into
that.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.797
I mean, "I'll wait for you in
the lobby,

09:58.799 --> 10:01.666
"would you like some popcorn?"

10:01.668 --> 10:02.901
Just stop complaining.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.235
Think of Trench.

10:08.208 --> 10:11.009
(door thudding)

10:12.379 --> 10:13.845
Ready.

10:13.847 --> 10:16.848
- I've got good news,
and I've got bad news.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.116
- Okay, can you tell me outside?

10:18.118 --> 10:19.951
I have to get going.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.785
- I should probably tell
you the bad news, then.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.655
We're locked in.

10:23.657 --> 10:24.356
- Yeah, right.

10:24.358 --> 10:26.658
- No, unfortunately, we are.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.093
I've tried every door.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.628
But it's not working, so.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.096
- Are you serious?

10:32.633 --> 10:33.865
(chuckling)

10:33.867 --> 10:35.033
This isn't funny.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.701
(door rattling)

10:36.703 --> 10:38.937
It's not romantic, either.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.740
- Look, I don't wanna be here
just as much as you don't.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.675
- Who even still goes to
the movies on a first date?

10:43.677 --> 10:45.360
Is that even a thing?

10:45.361 --> 10:47.044
A dating tip from your
grandma, or something?

10:47.047 --> 10:51.850
- No, she passed away before
she could give me any tips.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.119
(sighing)

10:54.121 --> 10:55.053
Jesus.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.791
Well, the good news is,
eventually they'll let us out.

10:59.793 --> 11:04.429
We might as well grab a
drink, have some gourmet food.

11:04.431 --> 11:07.866
Security cameras will pick us
up, and someone will find us.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.435
(door rattling)

11:12.139 --> 11:14.739
(sighing)

11:14.741 --> 11:17.909
(door rattling)

11:17.911 --> 11:20.311
(soft music)

11:22.883 --> 11:24.149
Dinner's ready.

11:33.226 --> 11:36.261
(case thudding)

11:36.262 --> 11:39.297
So, on tonight's menu, we have
two gourmet hot dogs, with a

11:40.200 --> 11:45.103
ketchup and mustard blend,
with poorly chopped onions.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.706
And for desert, you're gonna
like this,

11:47.708 --> 11:50.308
an assortment of chocolate bars.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.178
- Alex, this isn't funny.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.746
I need to get back to work.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.248
- Work?

11:56.249 --> 11:57.749
Who goes on a date before the
night shift.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.818
Really?

11:59.819 --> 12:01.886
For the appetizer, I was
thinking, you know, popcorn cup.

12:01.888 --> 12:05.256
But as you know, no popcorn
after 10, so.

12:06.727 --> 12:07.792
- Make some.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.994
- It is a bit messy.

12:09.996 --> 12:11.062
- Hm, first.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.333
- Really?

12:15.335 --> 12:17.335
Okay, yeah, yeah, sure.

12:20.874 --> 12:24.409
Jean Raffanier, 2000 and
something.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.810
Good year.

12:25.812 --> 12:26.478
- Classy.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.297
- Yeah.

12:28.298 --> 12:30.115
- Now, I'm a little hungry.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.049
- Good.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.258
- Well, I assume my
cooking isn't that bad.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.328
- Do you cook, except for, you
know?

12:44.164 --> 12:45.430
- Now and then.

12:46.299 --> 12:47.832
- Don't ask.

12:47.834 --> 12:51.236
I know, I have a
microwave, so why would I?

12:51.238 --> 12:52.437
- Your health.

12:54.508 --> 12:56.274
- Let's not even go there.

12:56.276 --> 12:59.077
I love all things gluten, sugar,

13:00.413 --> 13:04.015
palm oil and Nutella, caffeine
and dairy.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.118
- Well, add a bottle of red
wine,

13:07.120 --> 13:10.121
and I'd consider another date.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.990
(bright, soft music)

13:11.992 --> 13:15.193
- So, when did your grandma pass
away?

13:23.870 --> 13:24.803
- Like 22

13:27.974 --> 13:29.274
years.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.441
22 years.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.010
- Years?

13:32.012 --> 13:33.211
You made it sound like it was
yesterday.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.213
What is wrong with you?

13:36.817 --> 13:40.285
- I know how to calm people
down, don't I?

13:44.124 --> 13:45.256
- You psycho.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.361
How 'bout that popcorn?

13:58.238 --> 13:59.904
(buttons clicking)

13:59.906 --> 14:01.206
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

14:01.207 --> 14:02.507
You can't keep pushing
buttons and expecting popcorn.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.108
It takes finesse.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.629
No, leave it.

14:07.630 --> 14:08.946
We need three tablespoons of
popcorn oil,

14:08.949 --> 14:10.515
otherwise it'll burn.

14:10.517 --> 14:14.452
- How do you know so much
about making popcorn, nerd?

14:14.454 --> 14:18.489
- My parents had a popcorn
machine when I was growing up.

14:18.491 --> 14:21.259
Assuming that the universal law

14:21.261 --> 14:24.128
of popcorn-making still applies.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.197
- Do you get to see your parents
often?

14:26.199 --> 14:28.399
- Not as much as I'd like.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.203
(scoop clanging)

14:32.205 --> 14:33.137
Wanna try?

14:34.608 --> 14:36.074
- How hard can it be?

14:36.076 --> 14:38.943
No one ever burns popcorn,
right?

14:41.915 --> 14:44.148
- Take this in here.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.650
- All right.

14:45.652 --> 14:46.584
- Right.

14:46.586 --> 14:47.886
Two scoops.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.554
Just don't make it messy.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.622
(kernels clinking)

14:50.624 --> 14:52.156
There we go, that's it.

14:52.158 --> 14:53.057
- Oops.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.392
A little clumsy.

14:55.428 --> 14:56.661
(scoop clanging)

14:56.663 --> 15:00.465
Relax, it's not like
we have to clean it up.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.234
- There we go.

15:06.506 --> 15:07.572
There we go.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.142
Okay.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.410
For your safety.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.478
- Thank you.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.281
Now we wait?

15:16.283 --> 15:17.482
- Yep.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.084
- [Zoe] Suspense.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.685
- [Alex] It's actually a
science, really, making popcorn

15:20.687 --> 15:21.653
- Is it?
- Yeah.

15:21.655 --> 15:23.454
- Wow.
- It's an art.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.656
- [Zoe] Very cool.

15:24.658 --> 15:25.590
- [Alex] Pop art.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.557
- [Zoe] Pop art.

15:26.559 --> 15:29.160
(chuckling)

15:29.162 --> 15:32.096
(popcorn popping)

15:38.138 --> 15:40.538
(soft music)

15:48.181 --> 15:49.247
- That's it.

15:50.717 --> 15:51.950
That's it.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.451
(popcorn popping)

15:53.453 --> 15:56.287
So then, you just dump it all
in.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.288
- Well, look at that.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.156
- There we go.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.023
- We made popcorn.

15:59.025 --> 15:59.958
- We did.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.531
- Ah, thank you.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.433
- No problem.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.969
Nice and clean, there we go.

16:10.971 --> 16:11.970
Can you pass me a cup, please?

16:11.972 --> 16:12.704
- Yeah.

16:15.342 --> 16:18.276
(popcorn plopping)

16:18.278 --> 16:20.378
- Oh, there we go.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.245
Thank you.

16:21.247 --> 16:22.180
- Sure.

16:23.750 --> 16:27.385
(scoop clanging)

16:27.387 --> 16:28.319
Ow.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.356
(soft, playful music)

16:31.358 --> 16:34.025
Could you not do that, please?

16:35.695 --> 16:37.228
Please don't do that.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.162
Really?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.432
Ooo, sorry.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.433
Oh, my bad.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.268
(gasping)

16:44.270 --> 16:46.170
Ooo, sorry, beg your pardon.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.305
- Oh, whoops.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.172
(grunting)

16:48.174 --> 16:49.040
My bad.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.308
- Come on, come on.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.776
- Oh, got it in the eye.

16:51.778 --> 16:52.710
- How you like me now?

16:52.712 --> 16:53.611
Oh, oh.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.446
- Oh, he means it.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.648
- Here we go, go on, hide.

16:59.419 --> 17:00.585
(giggling)

17:00.586 --> 17:01.752
Can't hide from me forever.

17:01.755 --> 17:02.754
- Watch me try.

17:02.756 --> 17:04.522
(chuckling)

17:04.524 --> 17:05.690
- Oh, it's coming raining.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.125
- Oh.
- It's raining.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.527
- Okay, all right, relax, relax.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.629
(grunting)

17:11.631 --> 17:12.697
- Bam.
- Oh.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.799
(chuckling)

17:14.801 --> 17:15.733
Wow.

17:17.103 --> 17:18.636
A gentleman, I see.

17:20.373 --> 17:25.076
(sighing)
(hands clapping)

17:25.078 --> 17:25.810
- Wow.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.684
(sighing)

17:35.588 --> 17:37.388
- Do you think we'll ever get
out of here?

17:37.390 --> 17:39.791
- Why, you got somewhere to be
tomorrow?

17:39.793 --> 17:40.725
- Yeah.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.796
Wow, made a mess.

17:46.366 --> 17:47.432
And no help.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.136
I need a piece of paper.

17:53.139 --> 17:54.072
- Okay.

18:00.113 --> 18:00.778
(paper rustling)

18:00.780 --> 18:01.646
Here we go.

18:01.648 --> 18:02.580
- Great.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.454
(pen scribbling)

18:14.194 --> 18:16.594
(paper rustling)

18:16.596 --> 18:19.397
- I can't read what that
says, and I'm two feet away.

18:19.399 --> 18:22.100
I don't think security's gonna
read that.

18:22.102 --> 18:26.204
Plus, if anyone was
here, we'd be kicked out.

18:26.206 --> 18:29.273
- You got a better idea,
smartypants?

18:29.275 --> 18:34.378
- Well, there must be a
spare set of keys somewhere.

18:34.380 --> 18:37.348
- You look on your
side, I'll look on mine.

18:37.350 --> 18:40.284
(objects rustling)

18:40.286 --> 18:43.121
(snoring)

18:43.123 --> 18:45.523
(soft music)

18:47.127 --> 18:50.128
(objects clanging)

18:54.534 --> 18:55.466
Boom.

18:56.769 --> 18:57.702
My way.

19:01.374 --> 19:02.373
Is that supposed to be a clue?

19:02.375 --> 19:04.208
- Well, let's try and see.

19:04.210 --> 19:05.727
- Yeah, right.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.245
That's when we split up in
the dark, and then one of us

19:07.247 --> 19:10.248
gets savagely murdered, probably
me.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.950
Thank you very much, but I am
staying

19:11.951 --> 19:13.651
right here, in front of the
cameras.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.652
- Oh.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.921
Miss Concerto chickens out.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.591
Don't be a baby.

19:20.592 --> 19:23.326
Look, it's better than,
what, just staying here?

19:25.431 --> 19:26.397
- Okay, will you hold on?
- Finally.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.566
- [Zoe] I'm coming.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.168
- Come on.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.235
- Okay.

19:31.237 --> 19:33.571
It's kind of exciting.

19:33.573 --> 19:34.705
- Ah ha.

19:34.707 --> 19:35.673
(door creaking)

19:35.675 --> 19:36.607
Yes.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.412
(snoring)

19:45.752 --> 19:47.235
- Wow, you really know how

19:47.236 --> 19:48.719
to entertain a girl on a first
date

19:48.721 --> 19:50.188
(chuckling)

19:50.190 --> 19:52.823
I warn you, if anything
or anyone pops out,

19:52.825 --> 19:54.759
I'm on their side, not yours.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.327
(chuckling)

19:56.329 --> 19:58.429
Why do you think it says
my way, dot dot dot?

19:58.431 --> 19:59.697
- I don't know.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.900
They must be a fan of Sinatra.

20:02.902 --> 20:03.768
- Right.

20:03.770 --> 20:04.936
Fly Me to the Moon.

20:04.938 --> 20:06.704
- Or Come Fly with Me.

20:06.706 --> 20:07.772
- So cheesy.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.341
Oh.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.777
Sorry, that's probably something
stupid.

20:12.779 --> 20:13.711
- Yeah.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.248
Oh yeah, just go ahead.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.251
(soft piano music)

20:21.921 --> 20:22.787
(screaming)

20:22.789 --> 20:24.355
- Oh, Jesus.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.456
- Oh.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.757
All clear.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.227
Thought I saw something.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.661
- Such a freak.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.363
What was I thinking?

20:32.365 --> 20:34.832
Only weirdos have online dates.

20:34.834 --> 20:35.900
- Oh come on, silly, we can
share

20:35.902 --> 20:38.436
online dating stories later.

20:44.777 --> 20:45.710
- Hmm.

20:46.512 --> 20:47.578
- All right.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.786
(buttons clicking)

20:55.788 --> 20:56.654
Hm.

20:56.656 --> 20:57.521
(machine beeping)

20:57.523 --> 20:58.389
You need a code?

20:58.391 --> 20:59.757
- Huh, weird.

20:59.759 --> 21:00.791
I mean, it looks like it.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.593
- Hm, well, find it.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.596
- Fine, I will.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.634
(soft music)

21:12.272 --> 21:15.506
(objects rattling)

21:15.508 --> 21:18.309
(air whooshing)

21:18.911 --> 21:21.912
(giggling)

21:21.914 --> 21:22.847
Hm.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.450
Well, it's not up here.

21:28.755 --> 21:31.455
(papers rustling)

21:31.457 --> 21:32.390
- Here?

21:33.459 --> 21:34.725
Let's find out.

21:39.465 --> 21:42.733
(machine beeping)

21:42.735 --> 21:43.668
Hm.

21:46.639 --> 21:50.574
Don't tell me you've never been
locked in a theater before.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.028
Oh, come on.

21:54.029 --> 21:55.378
You've never been to an escape
room?

21:55.381 --> 21:57.348
- Escape what?

21:57.350 --> 21:59.083
- Room.

21:59.084 --> 22:00.817
You pay $100, they lock
you in a staged room,

22:00.820 --> 22:04.722
and you solve a bunch
of clues, and escape.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.057
It's pretty cool.

22:06.059 --> 22:09.360
- Why would I pay to be
locked inside a room?

22:09.362 --> 22:11.362
- Isn't that what you did
tonight?

22:11.364 --> 22:12.763
- Smart ass.

22:12.765 --> 22:13.931
(humming)

22:13.933 --> 22:16.801
(mouth clicking)

22:18.404 --> 22:21.806
Come on, whenever you're ready,
Macgyver.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.078
- Six time seven?

22:28.514 --> 22:30.014
- Numbers not your thing?

22:30.016 --> 22:33.417
- Okay, I have discount-chulia,
it's a disease.

22:33.419 --> 22:36.821
So, I would I appreciate it if
you wouldn't be so sarcastic.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.556
Thank you.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.958
(soft music)

22:41.761 --> 22:42.626
42.

22:42.628 --> 22:43.828
- Times eight?

22:46.099 --> 22:46.997
- 336.

22:46.999 --> 22:47.865
- Times five.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.133
- Really?
- Mmhmm.

22:49.135 --> 22:50.468
- Times five.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.437
1480, no, no, 1680.

22:54.707 --> 22:55.639
Wow.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.376
Really?

22:58.378 --> 22:59.410
- Uh-huh.

22:59.412 --> 23:02.380
(machine beeping)

23:02.382 --> 23:04.081
(machine whirring)

23:04.083 --> 23:05.649
(whistling)

23:05.651 --> 23:06.617
- That's pretty good.

23:06.619 --> 23:09.120
I'm impressed.
- Mmhmm.

23:09.122 --> 23:10.821
All right.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.156
- Oh.

23:12.158 --> 23:13.991
Got a short here.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.626
- Short film.
- That's what it looks like.

23:15.628 --> 23:16.694
- Are you trying to kill me?

23:16.696 --> 23:17.628
- No.

23:18.664 --> 23:20.598
- [Zoe] No, shorts are boring.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.899
- Actually, incorrect.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.934
Boogie Nights would not be
Boogie Nights

23:23.936 --> 23:27.638
if it didn't have the short
start, so.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.572
- Touchy.

23:29.842 --> 23:30.725
- It's about to start.

23:30.726 --> 23:31.609
We got 30 seconds, come on.

23:31.611 --> 23:32.877
Go, go, go.

23:32.879 --> 23:33.811
Key.

23:37.116 --> 23:39.683
(sighing)

23:39.685 --> 23:42.520
(seats creaking)

23:45.825 --> 23:48.025
(sighing)

23:49.629 --> 23:51.729
- Boogie Nights, really?

23:51.731 --> 23:53.464
That's all you got?

23:55.501 --> 23:57.668
I swear, you're killing
me with this right now.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.170
- But do you have a better idea?

23:59.172 --> 24:00.037
(shushing)

24:00.039 --> 24:01.505
- It's starting.

24:01.507 --> 24:03.808
(soft music)

24:03.810 --> 24:06.444
(reel clicking)

24:06.446 --> 24:09.113
(engine humming)

24:29.902 --> 24:32.670
(sighing)

24:32.672 --> 24:34.505
- Is that the guy from Big?

24:34.507 --> 24:37.074
- You know, we don't need to
whisper.

24:37.076 --> 24:39.143
We're alone in here, so.

24:40.480 --> 24:41.679
Talk normally.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.648
- Thank you.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.050
- Unless Jerry's here.

24:46.052 --> 24:47.585
(giggling)

24:47.587 --> 24:49.587
- I never saw that guy.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.224
She was bonkers, wasn't she?

24:55.928 --> 24:58.028
- [Alex] Zoltar's doing a good
job, yeah.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.097
- Is it just me, or does he
kind of look like Tom Hanks?

25:00.099 --> 25:00.998
- Who, Zoltar?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.666
- No, the big guy.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.569
- [Alex] Yeah, I can see it.

25:05.571 --> 25:07.188
- 'Cause he's giving me a vibe.

25:07.189 --> 25:08.806
- Yeah, it's a show, actually,
it's a good observation.

25:08.808 --> 25:10.040
Kinda like boy-ish charm.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.108
- She's like, quality.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.610
- Yeah yeah, no, I get it.

25:12.612 --> 25:13.277
- Exactly.

25:13.279 --> 25:14.612
- Ruggedly handsome.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.931
Is that how you'd describe Tom
Hanks?

25:16.932 --> 25:19.249
More like straight man,
actually, more like, you know.

25:19.252 --> 25:20.284
Yeah.

25:20.286 --> 25:21.552
- [Zoe] Yeah.

25:21.553 --> 25:22.819
- [Alex] You're right,
he is the guy from Big.

25:22.822 --> 25:24.288
- [Zoe] Yeah, he is, yeah.

25:24.289 --> 25:25.755
- [Alex] He was great in
Riding in Cars with Boys.

25:25.758 --> 25:26.624
Did you see that?

25:26.626 --> 25:27.291
- [Zoe] No.

25:27.293 --> 25:28.192
- It's a good movie.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.660
I studied at the university.

25:29.662 --> 25:30.528
- Oh yeah?

25:30.530 --> 25:31.695
- Yeah.

25:31.697 --> 25:32.997
- Studied Riding in Cars with
Boys?

25:32.999 --> 25:34.098
- It's a great movie, okay?

25:34.100 --> 25:35.666
Drew Barrymore's tour de force.

25:35.668 --> 25:38.802
Should have won an Oscar,
Steve Zahn's wonderful.

25:38.804 --> 25:41.205
(soft music)

25:44.243 --> 25:48.145
You probably know the movie
he was in called Honey.

25:48.147 --> 25:49.547
- Missed that one.
- It's a classic,

25:49.548 --> 25:50.948
it's a dance movie classic.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.316
- [Zoe] Dance movie classic?

25:52.318 --> 25:53.817
- Yeah, that's right.

25:53.819 --> 25:57.655
Jessica Alba plays a
street dancer named Honey.

25:57.657 --> 25:58.889
Gets into some bad problems.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.090
- I do love me some Jessica
Alba.

26:00.092 --> 26:01.041
- Exactly.

26:01.042 --> 26:01.991
- Who doesn't?
- Who doesn't?

26:01.994 --> 26:03.561
- Apparently we agree on that.

26:03.563 --> 26:04.295
- Good.

26:05.631 --> 26:07.765
- [Zoe] Ooo, what's this?

26:08.634 --> 26:10.601
She is pissed.

26:10.603 --> 26:13.137
- [Alex] Well, wouldn't you,
if someone took your chair?

26:13.139 --> 26:15.673
Obviously she's got a dodgy knee
or hip.

26:15.675 --> 26:17.575
- [Zoe] She didn't take her
chair, there are other chairs.

26:17.577 --> 26:19.577
- [Alex] Yes, but it's
obvious she's an elderly lady,

26:19.579 --> 26:21.745
who needs some sort of
assistance.

26:21.747 --> 26:24.148
What's happening, what's that?

26:24.150 --> 26:25.583
- [Zoe] I don't know.

26:25.585 --> 26:29.019
- [Alex] It looks like
she just hit her there.

26:29.021 --> 26:31.722
It's about young people
responding not well

26:31.724 --> 26:36.026
to the elderly ideologies of
what has come from the past.

26:36.028 --> 26:37.127
- [Zoe] That seems like a
stretch.

26:37.128 --> 26:38.227
- [Alex] But then, she's
blocking her now,

26:38.230 --> 26:39.663
so she's also not helping.

26:39.665 --> 26:40.831
- [Zoe] You're agreeing.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.366
Just booted her out.

26:42.368 --> 26:43.701
- [Alex] Well, we need to work
together.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.235
That's the whole point.

26:45.237 --> 26:46.370
- No, you're.

26:46.372 --> 26:47.237
- Tete-a-tete, you know?

26:47.239 --> 26:49.340
- [Zoe] Tete-a-tete?

26:49.342 --> 26:50.341
See, he's gonna let her win this
one.

26:50.343 --> 26:52.527
- [Alex] Oh.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.712
- [Zoe] Is this gonna be a
whole movie about tic-tac-toe?

26:54.714 --> 26:56.046
- [Alex] Would you let me win?

26:56.048 --> 26:57.848
- [Zoe] Not a chance.

26:57.850 --> 27:00.784
- [Alex] Good to know, thanks.

27:00.786 --> 27:01.785
What's your type?

27:01.787 --> 27:02.653
- Tom Hanks.

27:02.655 --> 27:03.387
- Right, that's good.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.206
- What were you looking for?

27:05.207 --> 27:07.024
- I don't know, something
flattering.

27:07.026 --> 27:08.759
- Colin Firth?

27:08.761 --> 27:10.544
Hugh Grant?

27:10.545 --> 27:12.328
- Yeah, there we go, that's
okay.

27:12.331 --> 27:15.065
Hugh Grant, yeah, a little less
foppish.

27:15.067 --> 27:16.734
- Foppish, what is foppish?

27:16.736 --> 27:18.902
- Just, you know, a bit foppy.

27:18.904 --> 27:20.804
- That doesn't explain it.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.106
You can't use the word in the
definition.

27:22.108 --> 27:24.074
It's not actually a thing.
- Okay, fine.

27:24.076 --> 27:27.111
Foppish, to be fop, slightly
dandy, but sort of pathetic,

27:27.113 --> 27:28.245
you could say.
- Slightly dandy?

27:28.247 --> 27:29.313
- Dandy.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.515
- What's dandy?

27:31.516 --> 27:33.716
- Sorry, we found the language,
not you.

27:34.920 --> 27:35.886
(pen scribbling)

27:35.888 --> 27:38.689
Now, let's get back to the game.

27:42.361 --> 27:43.394
Ostentatious.

27:43.396 --> 27:45.029
- [Zoe] Ooo.

27:45.031 --> 27:47.898
- Do you know what that means?

27:47.900 --> 27:48.766
- Yeah.

27:48.768 --> 27:49.433
(pen clicking)

27:49.435 --> 27:51.168
Do you?

27:51.170 --> 27:52.102
- Yes.

27:52.905 --> 27:54.038
- Cool, I'm glad we both know.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.172
- Good, okay.

27:56.442 --> 27:59.910
The ability to attract
attention to oneself.

27:59.912 --> 28:00.978
Ostentatious.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.079
- Oh, so you've been familiar

28:02.081 --> 28:03.147
with that word for a long time.

28:03.149 --> 28:04.081
- Hmm.

28:06.352 --> 28:09.386
- [Zoe] So, she almost
gave him her number.

28:09.388 --> 28:10.888
See, she's got the hat, she gets
it.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.056
(chuckling)

28:12.058 --> 28:13.374
- [Alex] It's the same dress

28:13.375 --> 28:14.691
as the seven year old, the
pigtails.

28:14.694 --> 28:15.359
(gasping)

28:15.361 --> 28:16.293
Oh.
- Oh.

28:16.295 --> 28:17.828
- [Alex] No.

28:17.830 --> 28:20.831
- [Zoe] She's cramping his
style.

28:20.833 --> 28:23.267
- [Alex] Yeah, I know what
that's like.

28:23.269 --> 28:25.736
(giggling)

28:30.209 --> 28:32.242
I don't know if I get it.

28:32.244 --> 28:34.244
- [Alex] You're not meant to get
it.

28:34.246 --> 28:35.646
- [Zoe] Me personally, or

28:35.647 --> 28:37.047
everyone?
- No, just in general,

28:37.048 --> 28:38.448
you're just not meant to get it.

28:38.449 --> 28:39.849
That's the whole point of it,
it makes you ask questions.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.151
There's no answers.

28:41.153 --> 28:42.820
It's like a bad episode of Lost.

28:42.821 --> 28:44.488
Actually no, it's like
every episode of Lost.

28:44.490 --> 28:45.956
- I haven't seen Lost either.

28:45.958 --> 28:47.224
- Don't bother.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.776
- I don't have a TV.

28:48.777 --> 28:50.327
- I lost three years of my life
to it.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.396
- 10 minutes of tic-tac-toe.

28:52.398 --> 28:55.132
Some writers definitely lack
imagination.

28:55.134 --> 28:57.334
- But it's not about
tic-tac-toe.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.403
It's a modern vision of
the sprayed sprinkler.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.939
- Oh, of course, right.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.874
You're a writer wannabe, right?

29:03.876 --> 29:06.160
- Thanks for the wannabe.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.445
- Sorry, I mean a writer
soon-to-be, is that better?

29:08.447 --> 29:10.948
Okay, so, if we were to write
this, wouldn't you want to be

29:10.950 --> 29:13.984
more universal, talk
about the big picture?

29:13.986 --> 29:15.753
- You work in a book store,
right?

29:15.755 --> 29:17.921
- I'm a literary specialist.

29:17.923 --> 29:19.490
- Okay.

29:19.491 --> 29:21.058
Well, you should try and write
yourself.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.426
And then you can judge.

29:22.428 --> 29:23.494
- Wow, okay.

29:24.463 --> 29:25.863
So, we're gonna elude this
topic.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.464
Remind me not to debate with you
again,

29:27.466 --> 29:30.033
you really go for the jugular.

29:30.035 --> 29:33.437
(sighing)
(chuckling)

29:33.439 --> 29:36.340
- Whoa, whoa, what were
you writing on the notepad?

29:36.342 --> 29:39.476
- Oh, I don't know, just notes.

29:39.478 --> 29:42.279
That they might be useful.

29:42.281 --> 29:45.082
(seat creaking)

29:50.122 --> 29:50.988
(sighing)

29:50.990 --> 29:51.922
So.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.793
What brought you to LA?

29:55.795 --> 29:56.794
Wanted to be an actor?

29:56.796 --> 29:58.028
- Oh, God no.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.029
Much worse.

29:59.031 --> 30:02.399
I followed a girl who
wanted to be an actress.

30:02.401 --> 30:03.267
- Oh.

30:03.269 --> 30:04.468
What happened.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.471
- Well, she followed a guy

30:07.473 --> 30:09.807
who will make her into an
actress.

30:09.809 --> 30:11.074
- Oh, do I know her?

30:11.076 --> 30:12.793
- Maybe.

30:12.794 --> 30:14.511
Are you familiar with the
Starbucks on 4th and Highland?

30:14.513 --> 30:16.847
She makes the best frappuccinos.

30:16.849 --> 30:19.416
(chuckling)

30:19.418 --> 30:20.884
- What's your story?

30:20.886 --> 30:22.853
- Oh, I moved here to go to law
school.

30:22.855 --> 30:24.605
- [Alex] And?

30:24.606 --> 30:26.356
- Well, I decided that
my life was worth more

30:26.358 --> 30:30.160
than just being a
lawyer, so I dropped out.

30:30.162 --> 30:34.031
- Not as glamorous as Legally
Blonde?

30:34.033 --> 30:34.965
- No.

30:34.967 --> 30:39.036
I actually created my own
handmade custom t-shirt company.

30:39.038 --> 30:41.405
You contact me on my
website, pitch me your idea,

30:41.407 --> 30:43.440
I design it, send you back three
options,

30:43.442 --> 30:46.510
you pick, and for $29.99,
you get it in your mailbox

30:46.512 --> 30:49.413
within 14 days, and you pride
yourself on quality materials

30:49.415 --> 30:51.548
and outstanding customer
service.

30:51.550 --> 30:52.449
- Wow.

30:55.254 --> 30:56.720
(stuttering)

30:56.721 --> 30:58.187
- Hey, come on, give
it back to me, please.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.857
- I just wanted you to play
something.

30:59.859 --> 31:00.524
- It's not tuned.

31:00.526 --> 31:01.959
- Well, we can tune it.

31:01.961 --> 31:02.793
- No.

31:02.794 --> 31:03.626
- But you're wearing a yes
t-shirt.

31:03.627 --> 31:04.459
- What, you speak French now.

31:04.460 --> 31:05.292
(speaking in a foreign language)

31:05.297 --> 31:06.163
- Of course.

31:06.164 --> 31:07.030
I'll give it back to you in a
minute.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.031
- Alex.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.031
- [Alex] You're meant to be a
product.

31:09.032 --> 31:10.031
- [Zoe] Meant to be a player?

31:10.032 --> 31:11.031
Come on, seriously.
- Yeah, a player.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.302
- Okay, okay, okay.

31:12.304 --> 31:13.170
- Come on.

31:13.172 --> 31:14.171
- I'll give it back.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.105
- Thank you, come on.

31:15.107 --> 31:15.973
- I'm gonna give it back.

31:15.975 --> 31:16.640
(sighing)

31:16.642 --> 31:17.875
Here you go.

31:17.877 --> 31:18.542
- Thank you.

31:18.544 --> 31:21.011
(grunting)

31:21.013 --> 31:22.696
- Wow.

31:22.697 --> 31:24.380
I always thought a violin
was a string instrument,

31:24.383 --> 31:25.649
not a woodwind.

31:25.651 --> 31:28.118
(groaning)

31:30.522 --> 31:32.289
Are you in an air guitar band?

31:32.291 --> 31:34.024
'Cause that makes a lot of
sense.

31:34.026 --> 31:37.094
- It was a prop at my old job,
okay?

31:38.163 --> 31:39.596
- [Alex] A prop?

31:39.598 --> 31:42.199
- I thought it would look cool.

31:42.201 --> 31:44.067
- I don't understand.

31:45.304 --> 31:46.236
- Listen.

31:48.140 --> 31:50.540
I have no special skills.

31:50.542 --> 31:53.977
I'm 28, and I have no idea
what I'm doing with my life.

31:53.979 --> 31:57.014
I print t-shirts in my
free time, and I pretend

31:57.016 --> 31:58.515
to know everything about
literature,

31:58.517 --> 32:01.919
even though I barely read
Alice in Wonderland as a kid.

32:01.921 --> 32:04.988
- What do you mean, you barely
read Alice in Wonderland?

32:04.990 --> 32:07.457
- Like, I mostly read it, but.

32:09.261 --> 32:10.594
- What about Animal Farm.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.129
- Mmm mmm.

32:12.131 --> 32:14.431
- You must have read The Hobbit.

32:14.433 --> 32:15.365
- No.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.069
- The Harry Potter series?

32:19.071 --> 32:20.304
- I missed it.

32:20.306 --> 32:21.972
- [Alex] The Goosebumps
anthology.

32:21.974 --> 32:23.440
- Okay, that's a guy's series.

32:23.442 --> 32:24.341
Girls don't read that.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.143
- Okay, Sweet Valley High.

32:26.145 --> 32:28.078
The Babysitter's Club.

32:29.481 --> 32:30.681
The Bible?

32:30.683 --> 32:33.216
(chuckling)

32:34.186 --> 32:35.452
What about Tom Sawyer?

32:35.454 --> 32:36.320
- I read Tom Sawyer.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.188
- [Alex] There we go.

32:39.625 --> 32:42.359
- 'Kay, I saw the cartoon, but.

32:43.228 --> 32:46.496
- No that's, well, at
least it's the same story,

32:46.498 --> 32:48.732
but you didn't really
put the work into it.

32:48.734 --> 32:50.133
- Mmhmm, yeah.

32:56.475 --> 32:59.710
- Did you use the violin to
impress me?

33:02.181 --> 33:03.547
It worked.

33:03.549 --> 33:05.015
Mission accomplished.

33:05.017 --> 33:06.683
Look, honest.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.552
Mission accomplished.

33:09.555 --> 33:11.755
(sighing)

33:30.009 --> 33:32.409
(soft music)

33:43.589 --> 33:47.090
(upbeat music)

33:47.092 --> 33:49.593
- Stop, in the name of the law.

33:52.231 --> 33:53.196
Dumb

33:53.198 --> 33:54.131
Pull.

33:58.570 --> 34:00.570
- Did you hear that?

34:00.572 --> 34:01.671
- No.

34:01.673 --> 34:04.408
- Come on, the footsteps.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.610
I swear I heard something.

34:08.247 --> 34:10.447
(sighing)

34:11.450 --> 34:13.717
- So, why choose the violin?

34:13.719 --> 34:17.521
Did you steal it from an
old granny, or something?

34:17.523 --> 34:21.191
- I told you, it was a prop at
my old job.

34:24.229 --> 34:25.529
And it looks cute.

34:25.531 --> 34:26.430
(chuckling)

34:26.432 --> 34:28.365
- You're such a hipster.

34:28.367 --> 34:30.300
Was this at the bookstore?

34:30.302 --> 34:34.438
- No, actually, I used to
work at an escape room.

34:41.680 --> 34:44.414
(upbeat music)

34:46.151 --> 34:50.087
- Have you ever seen a taser
that you couldn't handle?

34:50.089 --> 34:52.289
(gasping)

34:55.427 --> 34:57.194
(object clanging)

34:57.196 --> 34:58.128
Broke it.

35:00.165 --> 35:01.798
Yeah, that was so sweet.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.534
Oh, my gosh, that was so sweet.

35:08.407 --> 35:09.339
Okay.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.814
It is time to get the bad guys.

35:33.765 --> 35:35.365
- Where are you going?

35:35.367 --> 35:37.334
- Don't worry, I'll be back in a
minute.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.201
Go back to sleep.

35:38.203 --> 35:39.503
- Don't leave without me.

35:39.505 --> 35:40.437
Promise.

35:41.573 --> 35:42.506
- Promise.

35:56.555 --> 35:58.889
(objects rattling)

35:58.891 --> 36:02.292
(telephone dialing)

36:02.294 --> 36:07.364
(telephone ringing)
(sighing)

36:08.333 --> 36:10.167
Come on, Taryn.

36:10.169 --> 36:14.171
Take off your earbuds
and answer the phone.

36:14.173 --> 36:17.440
(phone vibrating)

36:17.442 --> 36:20.577
(water splashing)

36:20.579 --> 36:21.912
(telephone ringing)

36:21.914 --> 36:23.413
(cellphone vibrating)

36:23.415 --> 36:26.816
(podcast softly playing)

36:29.521 --> 36:31.721
(sighing)

36:34.560 --> 36:35.725
- Who's there?

36:35.727 --> 36:37.527
- Your brother, popcorn freak.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.663
What was that about?

36:39.664 --> 36:41.798
- I don't know, I just
thought you should be healthy.

36:41.800 --> 36:42.966
How's it going?

36:42.968 --> 36:44.434
- [Alex] Actually, very well.

36:44.436 --> 36:45.936
We just finished the short.

36:45.938 --> 36:47.237
- Did she like it?

36:47.239 --> 36:48.872
- She doesn't understand art.

36:48.874 --> 36:50.207
(giggling)

36:50.209 --> 36:51.508
- Yeah, right.

36:51.509 --> 36:52.808
Good thing you didn't
show her the little guys

36:52.811 --> 36:55.345
on the traffic light, or
whatever the fuck that shit is.

36:55.347 --> 36:57.380
- Yeah, yeah, well one
day, you'll thank me

36:57.382 --> 36:59.416
for being part of my adventures.

36:59.418 --> 37:01.318
- [Taryn] Yeah, doubtful.

37:01.320 --> 37:05.288
- Anyway, look, I need
a couple of hours, so.

37:05.290 --> 37:06.590
- Oh, come on.

37:06.592 --> 37:08.325
I have a life.

37:08.327 --> 37:09.292
- Please.

37:09.294 --> 37:10.860
Look, I'll make it up to you.

37:10.862 --> 37:11.761
Promise.

37:13.298 --> 37:14.965
- Is she even worth it?

37:14.967 --> 37:15.899
- She was.

37:15.901 --> 37:16.766
I mean, she is.

37:16.768 --> 37:19.236
I mean, she could be.

37:19.238 --> 37:22.539
I think she's overall pretty
clutch.

37:22.541 --> 37:24.708
- Clutch, that's so romantic.

37:24.710 --> 37:26.309
- [Alex] Thank you.

37:26.311 --> 37:28.278
- Always a pleasure.

37:28.280 --> 37:31.881
- Oh, oh, and remember
to tell Escott, yeah?

37:33.318 --> 37:34.017
(telephone rattling)

37:34.019 --> 37:35.285
(gasping)

37:35.287 --> 37:38.021
(water splashing)

37:39.424 --> 37:40.357
- Shit.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.995
(telephone ringing)

37:52.304 --> 37:53.036
Pick up.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.273
Voicemail?

37:56.275 --> 37:57.007
Useless.

37:58.310 --> 38:00.027
(sighing)

38:00.028 --> 38:01.745
Pay him to sit in his chair
and watch the monitor.

38:01.747 --> 38:04.314
And answer the phones.

38:04.316 --> 38:05.482
(jeans zipping)

38:05.484 --> 38:06.650
Oh, my God.

38:06.652 --> 38:09.452
(exhaling)

38:09.454 --> 38:10.754
(drink slurping)

38:10.756 --> 38:11.688
Mmm.

38:13.425 --> 38:16.493
(slippers rattling)

38:20.432 --> 38:22.249
- Hey.

38:22.250 --> 38:24.067
You don't move, you don't speak,

38:24.069 --> 38:26.736
and you do exactly what I say.

38:27.706 --> 38:28.738
- Escott--
(grunting)

38:28.740 --> 38:31.541
- What did I just say, no
talking.

38:31.543 --> 38:34.744
Now, put your hands up, or I
tase you.

38:38.050 --> 38:40.517
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

38:41.320 --> 38:44.988
Oh, a bottle of wine
and some chocolate bars,

38:46.425 --> 38:49.059
and oh, my favorite, Twizzlers.

38:49.061 --> 38:51.628
That sounds like jail time to
me.

38:51.630 --> 38:53.480
- Escott.

38:53.481 --> 38:55.331
- Listen, if you say one
more word, I am gonna stick

38:55.334 --> 38:58.435
a charge into you like
you wouldn't believe.

38:58.437 --> 39:01.004
Wait, how do you know my name?

39:01.006 --> 39:03.640
- And now the penny drops.

39:03.642 --> 39:04.641
(taser firing)

39:04.643 --> 39:05.842
(grunting)

39:05.844 --> 39:06.910
What the fuck, Escott?

39:06.912 --> 39:09.696
- Oh, mt God.

39:09.697 --> 39:12.481
I'm so sorry, I never,
the thing just went off,

39:12.484 --> 39:14.851
and I didn't know that that was
you.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.119
- I was sitting behind you.

39:16.121 --> 39:18.488
- [Escott] No, but I thought you
left.

39:18.490 --> 39:21.458
- [Alex] But Taryn told you
I was staying here tonight.

39:21.460 --> 39:25.095
- No, no, no, no, Mr. Porter,
she did not, I promise.

39:25.097 --> 39:26.996
- She said that I was
gonna be staying here

39:26.998 --> 39:28.765
for a couple more hours.

39:28.766 --> 39:30.533
- [Escott] No, no, not
tonight, she didn't.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.535
- [Alex] Oh, God Taryn.

39:32.537 --> 39:34.671
So, how long have you had this
toy for?

39:34.673 --> 39:37.040
- Well, since last week.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.509
It makes me feel safer.

39:39.511 --> 39:40.961
- Yeah?

39:40.962 --> 39:42.412
Maybe you could do a
little bit more practice.

39:42.414 --> 39:45.715
- Yeah, well, I know, but
it's really hard to practice,

39:45.717 --> 39:48.818
and I didn't know that
it was gonna be so fast,

39:48.820 --> 39:52.589
and if it makes you feel any
better,

39:52.591 --> 39:54.657
you were my first.

39:54.659 --> 39:55.792
- Great.

39:55.794 --> 39:56.860
Great, okay.

39:56.862 --> 39:58.528
Listen to me, Escott.

39:58.530 --> 40:00.163
- [Escott] Yes, Mr. Porter?

40:00.165 --> 40:04.067
- You can leave, but you must
lock the doors before you go.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.435
- Right, okay, yes.

40:05.437 --> 40:07.003
- Don't worry about security.

40:07.005 --> 40:08.471
I've got your back.

40:08.473 --> 40:10.039
But Escott?

40:10.041 --> 40:11.007
(hushing)

40:11.009 --> 40:12.108
Quiet.

40:12.110 --> 40:12.976
(hushing)

40:12.978 --> 40:14.010
- Got it.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.011
- Okay?

40:15.013 --> 40:15.912
- Quiet.

40:15.914 --> 40:17.113
- Good.
- Yes.

40:18.617 --> 40:19.649
(wrapper crinkling)

40:19.651 --> 40:20.784
- Have these.

40:20.786 --> 40:21.751
- Thank you.

40:21.753 --> 40:25.155
(soft, mysterious music)

40:33.098 --> 40:36.466
I get to keep the taser, right?

40:36.468 --> 40:37.901
- Yes, you can keep the taser.

40:37.903 --> 40:39.486
- Yes.

40:39.487 --> 40:41.070
- Just keep it away from me.

40:41.072 --> 40:42.105
- Got it.

40:42.107 --> 40:42.972
(hushing)

40:42.974 --> 40:44.707
- Quiet.
- Quiet.

40:44.709 --> 40:45.642
- And now.

40:48.046 --> 40:48.978
- Perfect.

40:50.949 --> 40:51.881
Okay.

41:16.942 --> 41:18.808
(humming)

41:18.810 --> 41:20.777
- You were gone a while.

41:20.779 --> 41:22.512
- You already can't be without
me.

41:22.514 --> 41:23.980
- I may have missed you a
little.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.248
- I brought more supplies.

41:25.250 --> 41:26.583
- Ah, wine.

41:26.585 --> 41:27.250
(groaning)

41:27.252 --> 41:28.718
I need wine.

41:28.720 --> 41:29.819
- I bet you do, Sue Ellen.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.221
(chuckling)

41:31.223 --> 41:32.622
More red wine.

41:34.192 --> 41:35.758
Oh, make yourself at home.

41:35.760 --> 41:36.960
- Mmhmm.

41:36.962 --> 41:39.062
Just getting more comfortable.

41:39.064 --> 41:41.197
We might be here a while.

41:42.634 --> 41:45.535
Wow, you don't need to get me
drunk.

41:45.537 --> 41:47.137
- I'm sorry.

41:47.138 --> 41:48.738
I think I'm in the wrong
theater, I was looking for Zoe.

41:48.740 --> 41:50.190
- Hmm.

41:50.191 --> 41:51.641
You know, I'm really, really
tired.

41:51.643 --> 41:52.709
- Then you should go to bed.

41:52.711 --> 41:54.010
- Mmm.

41:54.012 --> 41:57.814
But, when I'm tired, I
get very, very horny.

42:02.821 --> 42:04.621
- Well, maybe I can help with
that.

42:04.623 --> 42:08.691
- Hmm, I'm sure you would
be very, very helpful.

42:09.995 --> 42:11.928
Do you think we'll ever get out
of here?

42:11.930 --> 42:14.965
- Hopefully not.

42:14.966 --> 42:18.001
I mean, we have wine, we
have food, and I have you.

42:18.003 --> 42:19.168
Sounds like paradise.

42:19.170 --> 42:20.603
- Yeah.

42:20.605 --> 42:22.272
That sounds marvelous.

42:22.274 --> 42:27.544
But, if that's so, then maybe,
we could have Escott join us.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.012
Wouldn't that be fun?

42:29.014 --> 42:31.047
I mean, the more, the merrier.

42:31.049 --> 42:32.048
- Escott, what?

42:32.050 --> 42:33.716
- What was the rest of the plan?

42:33.718 --> 42:35.652
You take advantage of me, and
then,

42:35.654 --> 42:37.086
you suddenly find the key
somewhere?

42:37.088 --> 42:39.022
- No, listen to me, listen.

42:39.024 --> 42:40.690
- Hey, no, you listen to me.

42:40.692 --> 42:42.559
I have been listening to
your bullshit all night.

42:42.561 --> 42:44.994
How many ladies have had the
privilege

42:44.996 --> 42:46.195
of being stuck in this shit
hole?

42:46.197 --> 42:47.597
- It's not like that.

42:47.599 --> 42:48.798
- Yeah, right, okay, you know
what?

42:48.800 --> 42:51.034
If I ever hear from you, see
you,

42:51.036 --> 42:55.104
or even smell you again,
I swear to you, I will,

42:56.074 --> 42:57.707
chop your balls off.

42:57.709 --> 43:00.109
(jazzy music)

43:00.111 --> 43:02.612
¶ You say that you change, ¶

43:02.614 --> 43:05.048
¶ That you were a better man ¶

43:05.050 --> 43:07.850
¶ But I've heard it all ¶

43:07.852 --> 43:09.986
¶ What have took me for ¶

43:09.988 --> 43:11.988
- Ah, some popcorn, or,

43:15.060 --> 43:17.860
whoa, calm yourself, woman.

43:17.862 --> 43:20.296
I knew something was
wrong with that chick.

43:20.298 --> 43:22.098
¶ Oh no ¶

43:22.100 --> 43:24.300
¶ You're not the one I need ¶

43:24.302 --> 43:27.904
¶ And you're not the everything
¶

43:27.906 --> 43:30.640
¶ Oh ¶

43:30.642 --> 43:32.709
¶ Oh no ¶

43:33.378 --> 43:34.978
- I'm sorry.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.080
- Eh, it was coming.

43:37.082 --> 43:38.815
I can't believe she was the only
one

43:38.817 --> 43:42.218
that thought my film was not
good enough.

43:44.055 --> 43:45.955
(groaning)

43:45.956 --> 43:47.856
Fine, apart from you, Roger
Ebert.

43:51.396 --> 43:53.730
- What the hell did you guys do?

43:53.732 --> 43:57.266
- She did have a
different way of thinking.

44:01.673 --> 44:05.041
- Well, it looks like she
knows how to have fun.

44:05.043 --> 44:08.111
- Oh yeah, I'm sorry, I'll clean
up.

44:13.752 --> 44:15.952
(sighing)

44:17.155 --> 44:21.157
- Miss Taryn, you really
should have called me.

44:23.028 --> 44:25.995
- Thanks for the heads up.

44:25.997 --> 44:27.730
- Yeah, no problem.

44:30.168 --> 44:34.137
- Did you guys know the
cacklet sleeps standing up.

44:34.139 --> 44:35.738
They dive down to grab snatches

44:35.740 --> 44:38.875
of sleep that last about 12
minutes,

44:38.877 --> 44:42.345
and then they slowly drift to
the surface.

44:43.882 --> 44:44.881
Head first.

44:46.117 --> 44:47.784
- Wow.

44:47.786 --> 44:48.718
- Yeah.

44:49.387 --> 44:51.120
- That's fascinating.

44:51.122 --> 44:52.055
- Mmhmm.

44:53.358 --> 44:55.825
(groaning)

44:58.830 --> 45:01.397
(inhaling)

45:01.399 --> 45:03.066
- I'm gonna get some sleep.

45:03.068 --> 45:04.333
I think you guys should, too.

45:04.335 --> 45:06.836
If you want to do it standing
up,

45:06.837 --> 45:09.338
sitting down, or lying
on the couch, I'm out.

45:13.945 --> 45:15.278
- Wait.

45:15.280 --> 45:17.914
I'll give you a ride.

45:17.916 --> 45:18.848
- Yeah.

45:21.352 --> 45:23.419
Okay guys, I'll lock up.

45:27.892 --> 45:30.760
(taser rattling)

45:35.800 --> 45:36.733
18th hole.

45:38.436 --> 45:40.503
Augusta National.

45:40.505 --> 45:42.505
For the masters.

45:42.507 --> 45:45.274
(putter clinking)

45:45.276 --> 45:47.443
Get in your hole.

45:47.445 --> 45:51.914
Let's go for a new personal
record of 403 in a row.

45:54.285 --> 45:56.319
(putter clinking)

45:56.321 --> 45:57.353
Oh, that's short.

45:57.355 --> 45:58.287
Gosh.

45:59.157 --> 46:01.124
(putter clanging)

46:01.126 --> 46:02.492
(sighing)

46:02.494 --> 46:03.960
Okay.

46:03.962 --> 46:06.295
I think it's the ball.

46:06.297 --> 46:08.197
I had a personal record going,

46:08.199 --> 46:11.934
and then, I just go, and I screw
it up.

46:11.936 --> 46:14.003
And now, I'm back at it.

46:14.005 --> 46:17.440
And that is what you call a
victory dance.

46:21.980 --> 46:23.980
- Thanks a lot, enjoy your
night.

46:23.982 --> 46:24.914
- Bye.

46:27.152 --> 46:29.085
- So, how many people.

46:30.021 --> 46:33.122
- Four, plus two, plus three,
plus four,

46:33.124 --> 46:34.056
so--
- 13.

46:34.893 --> 46:35.825
- 13.

46:36.895 --> 46:38.361
- We need to do something.

46:38.363 --> 46:41.364
We can't carry on the way it is.

46:41.366 --> 46:43.366
- Maybe I have an idea.

46:45.270 --> 46:46.202
- Okay.

46:47.138 --> 46:48.805
Do tell.

46:48.807 --> 46:51.908
- Okay, you can't compete
with the multiplex.

46:51.910 --> 46:55.211
So, why don't we do something
different.

46:56.881 --> 46:57.814
- Right.

46:57.816 --> 47:01.284
Your plan does have a stage two,
right?

47:01.286 --> 47:03.219
- Do a themed theater.

47:04.289 --> 47:06.022
- A themed theater?

47:07.158 --> 47:08.090
- Okay.

47:09.394 --> 47:11.861
So, today we had 13 customers.

47:11.863 --> 47:13.129
$10, that's,

47:13.131 --> 47:14.363
- 130.

47:14.365 --> 47:16.399
- Smart ass.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.434
So, what if we have five
screenings a day,

47:18.436 --> 47:21.170
but only two customers per
screening?

47:21.172 --> 47:24.006
Now, you're thinking,
that's less than now.

47:24.008 --> 47:27.476
But no, not if we charge $50 per
customer.

47:28.313 --> 47:30.780
Why 50?

47:30.781 --> 47:33.248
Because the price of the
movie date experience.

47:35.420 --> 47:37.486
- Okay, continue, go on.

47:38.523 --> 47:40.957
- All right, so, for two hours,

47:40.959 --> 47:43.926
the theater is theirs, entirely
theirs.

47:43.928 --> 47:47.997
No employees, no popcorn
girl, no projectionist.

47:47.999 --> 47:50.566
They have entry, and then the
whole place to themselves.

47:50.568 --> 47:54.403
Basically, it's home at the
theater, or theater at home.

47:54.405 --> 47:56.339
The first DIY theater.

48:00.545 --> 48:02.412
- That's great.

48:02.413 --> 48:04.280
No, that is an unbelievable
idea.

48:05.316 --> 48:06.382
I could kiss you.

48:06.384 --> 48:07.967
- Don't kiss me.

48:07.968 --> 48:09.551
- No, I'm not going to, but
that's still a great idea.

48:09.554 --> 48:11.153
- And last but not least, we can
supervise

48:11.155 --> 48:13.155
from the security room, so
if they have any issues,

48:13.157 --> 48:14.991
we can interact with them from
there,

48:14.993 --> 48:17.326
just like in an escape room.

48:18.529 --> 48:21.230
- What is it with you
girls and escape rooms?

48:21.232 --> 48:22.465
- Hm?

48:22.467 --> 48:23.399
- Nothing.

48:25.103 --> 48:27.169
No, I really like this.

48:27.171 --> 48:29.005
This is great.

48:29.007 --> 48:32.141
Okay, let's start it
tomorrow morning, 8:00 a.m.

48:32.143 --> 48:33.876
- I'm sorry, eight?

48:33.877 --> 48:35.610
- Well, great entrepreneurs wake
up early.

48:35.613 --> 48:37.680
It's a compliment.

48:37.682 --> 48:40.283
You'll get used to it, relax.

48:43.221 --> 48:46.055
- I should have kept my mouth
shut.

48:46.057 --> 48:48.424
Yo, the towel, you're bringing
it home?

48:48.426 --> 48:50.626
- Yeah, it's a white flag.

48:52.530 --> 48:54.997
(relaxed music)

48:54.998 --> 48:57.465
(singing in a foreign language)

49:14.485 --> 49:16.419
- He just took a left.

49:26.197 --> 49:28.497
Deli meat, eight letters.

49:28.499 --> 49:30.166
What have you got?

49:32.470 --> 49:33.736
- Salt beef.

49:33.738 --> 49:35.137
- [Taryn] What?

49:35.139 --> 49:36.639
- Salt beef.

49:36.641 --> 49:38.374
- Salt beef, that isn't a thing.

49:38.376 --> 49:39.675
- It is a thing.

49:39.677 --> 49:42.044
It's a deli.

49:42.045 --> 49:44.412
Good evening, welcome,
how you doing tonight?

49:51.356 --> 49:53.756
- How the hell wrote a movie
about this stupid game?

49:53.758 --> 49:57.493
(tickets ripping)

49:57.495 --> 49:58.761
- Great choice.

50:00.298 --> 50:02.498
- In a world of war and
injustice,

50:02.500 --> 50:06.702
Bruce has found a way to
bring back peace on earth.

50:06.704 --> 50:08.771
Tic-tac-toe toe toe toe.

50:11.743 --> 50:13.743
- You know, I was thinking, T,

50:13.745 --> 50:16.012
you should apply for a job at
Disney Land.

50:16.014 --> 50:17.425
I mean, your

50:17.426 --> 50:18.837
(speaking in a foreign language)

50:18.838 --> 50:20.249
be much valued over there.

50:20.251 --> 50:21.183
- Honey.

50:22.387 --> 50:25.388
(objects rattling)

50:27.358 --> 50:30.159
(keys jingling)

50:38.469 --> 50:41.203
(upbeat music)

51:26.451 --> 51:27.416
- Was salt beef right?

51:27.418 --> 51:28.484
- Salt beef isn't a thing.

51:28.486 --> 51:30.319
- It is a thing.

51:30.321 --> 51:32.455
You have it on rye bread.

51:33.791 --> 51:36.192
It's taking you this long.

51:39.263 --> 51:42.431
(birds chirping)

51:42.433 --> 51:45.668
(soothing music)

51:45.670 --> 51:48.370
(bell chiming)

51:52.343 --> 51:53.776
- Hello.

51:53.778 --> 51:55.111
Anybody here?

51:56.481 --> 51:58.180
It's your lucky day.

51:58.182 --> 51:59.815
You have a customer trying to
buy a book.

51:59.817 --> 52:01.550
- Yes, yes, coming.

52:02.620 --> 52:04.887
Hi, I'm here, how can I help
you?

52:04.889 --> 52:06.789
- Back there, like, working out?

52:06.791 --> 52:08.324
- Long story.

52:08.326 --> 52:11.494
So, what is it you're looking
for?

52:11.496 --> 52:12.795
- It's a gift.

52:12.797 --> 52:14.763
Something readable.

52:14.765 --> 52:18.234
Yeah, readable is a good start.

52:18.236 --> 52:21.237
Fun, but dramatic at the same
time.

52:22.206 --> 52:24.373
I don't know, something new.

52:24.375 --> 52:25.374
- Hm.

52:25.376 --> 52:27.476
How 'bout US Weekly?

52:27.478 --> 52:28.911
- Oh, she's funny, too.

52:28.913 --> 52:32.181
- Wait a minute, you look
familiar.

52:32.183 --> 52:32.848
(groaning)

52:32.850 --> 52:34.383
You're the popcorn freak.

52:34.385 --> 52:35.351
(giggling)

52:35.353 --> 52:36.502
- Guilty.

52:36.503 --> 52:37.652
Okay, but just listen to me for
a second.

52:37.655 --> 52:38.754
- Look, I don't have time for
this.

52:38.756 --> 52:40.523
I have work to do.

52:40.524 --> 52:42.291
- No, it'll just take a minute,
I promise.

52:42.293 --> 52:44.927
All your customers can wait.

52:44.929 --> 52:48.164
- It's the holidays,
people buy food, not books.

52:48.166 --> 52:51.233
- Oh, of course, it's the
holidays.

52:51.235 --> 52:54.570
All right, so Alex has this
new concept at the theater.

52:54.572 --> 52:55.905
It was actually my idea.

52:55.907 --> 52:57.873
I am the brains, after all.

52:57.875 --> 53:01.377
But you would like it,
so you should come by.

53:01.379 --> 53:02.411
- Look, popcorn.

53:02.413 --> 53:04.313
- Taryn.

53:04.314 --> 53:06.214
- Look, Popcorn Taryn, I know in
a romcom,

53:06.217 --> 53:08.851
that would be the perfect time
for me to start missing Alex,

53:08.853 --> 53:10.452
having remorse and run to him,
but--

53:10.454 --> 53:13.589
- Hm, she's an expert of the
cinema, too.

53:13.591 --> 53:15.391
- I know my classics.

53:15.393 --> 53:17.793
But the fact is, I'm really over
him,

53:17.795 --> 53:19.595
if I was ever into him in the
first place.

53:19.597 --> 53:23.265
So, I appreciate the thought,
but I think I'll pass.

53:23.267 --> 53:25.501
- You guys are both so stubborn.

53:25.503 --> 53:26.435
- Look,

53:27.738 --> 53:30.506
I have to get back to working
out.

53:30.508 --> 53:31.874
- Be careful carrying on like
that.

53:31.876 --> 53:34.610
I might start to like you soon.

53:36.380 --> 53:39.682
If you ever change your mind,
text me.

53:39.684 --> 53:42.518
Don't call me, speaking on
the phone gives me anxiety.

53:42.520 --> 53:43.669
(pencil scribbling)

53:43.670 --> 53:44.819
- Looks like you're gonna need
more time

53:44.822 --> 53:46.422
to find the right book.

53:46.424 --> 53:47.790
- No, you're right.

53:47.792 --> 53:49.992
I'll stick with US Weekly.

53:51.796 --> 53:53.395
- Bye.

53:53.397 --> 53:54.697
(sighing)

53:54.699 --> 53:57.533
(soft music)

53:57.535 --> 54:00.469
(traffic humming)

54:03.941 --> 54:05.374
- [Woman] Let's go out, meet
fresh meat.

54:05.375 --> 54:06.808
- [Zoe] No, I can't go,
I have work tomorrow.

54:06.811 --> 54:08.911
- [Woman] Come on, where's the
stool?

54:08.913 --> 54:10.479
(chuckling)

54:10.481 --> 54:12.665
- Yeah, I know.

54:12.666 --> 54:14.850
- [Woman] Seriously, no one
will notice, it's dead empty.

54:14.852 --> 54:16.885
Anyway, what's the plan for
Halloween?

54:16.887 --> 54:18.120
(chuckling)

54:18.121 --> 54:19.354
- Of course, I'm not doing
anything for Halloween.

54:19.357 --> 54:20.256
- [Woman] A costume.

54:20.258 --> 54:21.857
- Nope, not negotiable.

54:21.859 --> 54:24.426
- Boring.
- Yeah, I know.

54:24.428 --> 54:26.262
- [Woman] Well, I guess
I'm just gonna sit here

54:26.264 --> 54:27.563
and stare at my cat.

54:27.565 --> 54:29.165
- Okay.

54:29.166 --> 54:30.766
I have a pile of t-shirts to
finish up.

54:30.768 --> 54:32.701
You can come help me instead.

54:32.703 --> 54:34.370
Halloween's overrated.

54:34.372 --> 54:36.505
- [Woman] Get yourself
a boyfriend to help.

54:36.507 --> 54:37.740
- A boyfriend?

54:37.742 --> 54:38.774
Yeah, right.
- Netflix and--

54:38.776 --> 54:40.776
- I do not not have Netflix.

54:40.778 --> 54:42.328
I do not wanna chill.

54:42.329 --> 54:43.879
- Hey, they're not all twats
like Alex.

54:43.881 --> 54:46.448
I mean, they almost all are.
- Hey.

54:46.450 --> 54:47.983
I gotta go, Thai food's waiting.

54:47.985 --> 54:49.551
- [Woman] Okay, enjoy ironing.

54:49.553 --> 54:50.552
- Okay.

54:50.554 --> 54:51.754
Bye bye.
- Bye.

54:55.459 --> 54:57.426
(lips smacking)

54:57.428 --> 55:01.430
¶ I want to walk with you in
moonlight ¶

55:01.432 --> 55:04.333
¶ And I know you're not in
heaven ¶

55:04.335 --> 55:06.368
¶ Go on and pretending ¶

55:06.370 --> 55:11.373
¶ That I really thought this ¶

55:11.375 --> 55:15.811
¶ Oh, when you're with me,
darling, ¶

55:15.813 --> 55:20.883
¶ You mean more to me than
anyone else ¶

55:21.385 --> 55:26.455
¶ I'm so confused by you ¶

55:26.724 --> 55:30.392
¶ I don't know what to do ¶

55:31.062 --> 55:33.996
(traffic humming)

55:41.806 --> 55:43.539
- What time are they coming?

55:43.541 --> 55:44.873
- The first couple are coming at
six,

55:44.875 --> 55:46.408
then we have 30 minute break.

55:46.410 --> 55:48.344
Second one comes at nine.

55:48.346 --> 55:49.778
- That's exciting.

55:49.780 --> 55:50.846
- Yeah.

55:50.847 --> 55:51.913
- Is the security room ready?

55:51.916 --> 55:52.981
- All ready.

55:56.420 --> 55:57.753
- All right.

55:57.755 --> 55:58.854
Everything's fine.

55:58.856 --> 56:00.989
Let's go get a beer, we have an
hour.

56:00.991 --> 56:02.591
- We have beer here, I don't
need a beer

56:02.593 --> 56:05.661
- Well, let's go get some fresh
air.

56:05.663 --> 56:08.964
- T, I was thinking, when are
you gonna get a proper job?

56:08.966 --> 56:10.999
- I could never stop working
with you.

56:11.001 --> 56:13.869
- You can't really call it work.

56:13.871 --> 56:14.870
- Let's go.

56:16.407 --> 56:17.473
- Fine, okay.

56:17.475 --> 56:19.575
Just for an hour, though.

56:19.577 --> 56:20.776
Can't be late.

56:25.850 --> 56:27.616
Taryn, what are we doing now?

56:27.618 --> 56:29.585
- Please, it'll just take a
minute.

56:29.587 --> 56:32.154
- I don't think they sell
gossip magazines here.

56:32.156 --> 56:33.555
- Don't start.

56:34.525 --> 56:37.726
Hello, your favorite customer is
here.

56:40.164 --> 56:42.698
- Oh, you again.
- Ah.

56:42.700 --> 56:45.667
- Look, if you need a
copy of Harry Potter,

56:45.669 --> 56:47.703
even signed by JK Rowling,
maybe I can help you.

56:47.705 --> 56:50.739
But if you're here to talk
about him, I think we're done.

56:50.741 --> 56:55.477
- Oh, I promise, I'm not
gonna talk about Alex, but,

56:55.479 --> 56:56.145
yeah.

56:56.147 --> 56:57.112
- What the hell, Popcorn?

56:57.114 --> 56:58.680
- Taryn, it's Taryn.

56:58.682 --> 56:59.715
- Yeah, what the hell, Popcorn.

56:59.717 --> 57:00.716
- You don't start.

57:00.718 --> 57:01.817
We're all here because of you.

57:01.819 --> 57:02.684
- Me?

57:02.686 --> 57:03.585
I didn't ask to be here.

57:03.587 --> 57:04.503
- Yeah, right.

57:04.504 --> 57:05.420
- I've got much better things to
do.

57:05.423 --> 57:06.422
- Mmhmm.

57:06.424 --> 57:07.089
- This is going well.

57:07.091 --> 57:09.792
- So, why are you here?

57:09.793 --> 57:12.494
To apologize, to beg me to
give you a second chance?

57:12.496 --> 57:14.163
Tell me how much you love me?

57:14.165 --> 57:15.948
Why?

57:15.949 --> 57:17.732
- No, I'm here because I got
tricked.

57:17.735 --> 57:19.768
- Oh, another of your little
games?

57:19.770 --> 57:22.971
- No, Taryn said we were
grabbing a drink to relax,

57:22.973 --> 57:24.506
and instead, she brought me
here.

57:24.508 --> 57:25.574
- Oh, like a date?

57:25.576 --> 57:26.608
Have you ever thought of dating
her?

57:26.610 --> 57:28.210
You two would make a great
couple.

57:28.212 --> 57:29.144
Kant.

57:31.849 --> 57:33.516
(chuckling)

57:33.517 --> 57:35.184
- I don't really think that's
legal here.

57:35.186 --> 57:36.118
My sister.

57:37.054 --> 57:38.053
- [Zoe] Sister?

57:38.055 --> 57:39.855
- Well, half-sister.

57:40.691 --> 57:41.790
Same dad.

57:41.792 --> 57:43.091
He passed away three years ago

57:43.093 --> 57:45.527
before we inherited the theater.

57:45.529 --> 57:47.896
- Wait, so that's your theater?

57:47.898 --> 57:49.832
- Yeah, all mine.

57:49.834 --> 57:51.233
Mine and Taryn's.

57:51.235 --> 57:57.506
We have a new concept, so I
really need to get going, so.

57:57.508 --> 57:58.173
- New concept?

57:58.175 --> 57:59.107
- Yeah.

58:00.678 --> 58:02.044
You seen Taryn anywhere?

58:02.046 --> 58:02.911
- [Zoe] No.

58:02.913 --> 58:03.846
- Taryn?

58:05.082 --> 58:08.550
(door rattling)

58:08.552 --> 58:11.487
(keys jingling)

58:11.489 --> 58:12.521
You have keys, right?

58:12.523 --> 58:13.522
- Oh, shit.

58:14.658 --> 58:17.693
- I really don't have time for
this.

58:17.695 --> 58:18.560
Taryn.

58:18.562 --> 58:19.661
Taryn.

58:19.663 --> 58:21.663
- [Taryn] I took her keys.

58:21.665 --> 58:22.531
- Taryn, what the hell?

58:22.533 --> 58:23.699
- Yeah, what the hell?

58:23.701 --> 58:24.967
- Oh, calm down.

58:24.969 --> 58:27.703
Get back to work, guys,
figure out more clues.

58:27.705 --> 58:29.104
All you've done is put up
cameras

58:29.106 --> 58:31.940
and shitty instructions
on how to make popcorn.

58:31.942 --> 58:33.575
Tell me you got a plan.

58:33.577 --> 58:34.927
- She's probably right.

58:34.928 --> 58:36.278
- Look, I'm not gonna tell you
again.

58:36.280 --> 58:38.046
Let me out, come on.

58:38.048 --> 58:40.782
- You said she was the
queen of escape rooms.

58:40.784 --> 58:43.986
Figure it out, and I'll open the
door.

58:45.656 --> 58:47.789
(door thudding)

58:47.791 --> 58:48.657
Whatever.

58:48.659 --> 58:50.158
(keys jingling)

58:50.160 --> 58:51.527
(sighing)

58:51.529 --> 58:53.162
- No, no, no.

58:53.163 --> 58:54.796
Okay, hey, maybe you can help,
okay?

58:54.798 --> 58:56.598
Remember our little
adventure at the theater?

58:56.600 --> 58:58.133
- Do I remember?

58:58.134 --> 58:59.667
- Okay, poor choice of
phrasing, fair play.

58:59.670 --> 59:01.970
Well, it inspired me.

59:01.972 --> 59:03.672
- I'm listening.

59:03.674 --> 59:05.941
- You guys love your dating
adventures in this country.

59:05.943 --> 59:07.376
- Dating adventures?

59:07.377 --> 59:08.810
- Yeah, you know about
dating, it's not about

59:08.812 --> 59:11.280
who you're with, it's about
having fun on the date.

59:11.282 --> 59:13.466
- So cliche.

59:13.467 --> 59:15.651
- Well, I made a new adventure.

59:15.653 --> 59:17.819
- What, you're selling your
services at the theater now?

59:17.821 --> 59:19.121
- Ha ha, very funny.

59:19.123 --> 59:21.890
No, it's a dating concept.

59:21.892 --> 59:23.225
A couple come to the theater,

59:23.227 --> 59:24.960
and they get locked in
for a couple of hours.

59:24.962 --> 59:25.861
- What, an escape room?

59:25.863 --> 59:26.728
- Exactly.

59:26.730 --> 59:28.680
- That's my idea.

59:28.681 --> 59:30.631
- God, it is crazy in
this city how many people

59:30.634 --> 59:32.901
think it's always their idea.

59:32.903 --> 59:34.303
- Right, my idea.

59:36.774 --> 59:38.307
- Ah, nice t-shirt.

59:40.177 --> 59:44.079
Anyway, we have our first
customers in a couple of hours.

59:44.081 --> 59:46.214
And if I'm not there, my idea--

59:46.216 --> 59:47.983
- [Taryn] Hey, I can hear you.

59:47.985 --> 59:49.251
- Taryn's idea,

59:50.054 --> 59:53.655
okay, your idea, whatever, it'll
be gone.

59:54.592 --> 59:55.975
(pen scribbling)

59:55.976 --> 59:57.359
- You had the popcorn figured
out.

59:57.361 --> 1:00:00.362
- Yeah, but we need a puzzle or
something,

1:00:00.364 --> 1:00:02.664
a more mysterious element to it.

1:00:02.666 --> 1:00:05.934
- What about the projector,
how hard is it to load a film?

1:00:05.936 --> 1:00:06.969
- Pretty easy.

1:00:06.971 --> 1:00:08.604
I mean, even Taryn can do it.

1:00:08.606 --> 1:00:11.173
(keys jingling)

1:00:11.175 --> 1:00:12.674
- Okay, okay.
- Sometime today, please.

1:00:12.676 --> 1:00:14.343
- What about the projection
booth?

1:00:14.345 --> 1:00:15.944
We needed a code to get in
there, right?

1:00:15.946 --> 1:00:17.379
- [Taryn] Come on.

1:00:18.315 --> 1:00:21.783
- Maybe we can hide the code
somewhere?

1:00:24.188 --> 1:00:26.688
I don't think the answer's
gonna be in a book.

1:00:26.690 --> 1:00:27.623
- Tah-dah.

1:00:27.625 --> 1:00:29.925
- Great, now she thinks she's
Houdini.-

1:00:29.927 --> 1:00:30.859
- Open it.

1:00:33.364 --> 1:00:36.632
The cards are numbered, two
through 10, with four suits.

1:00:36.634 --> 1:00:38.033
Right?

1:00:38.035 --> 1:00:40.969
- Zoe, it's now not really
the time for strip poker.

1:00:40.971 --> 1:00:42.404
(groaning)

1:00:42.406 --> 1:00:44.740
- Two through 10 can be our base
numbers.

1:00:44.742 --> 1:00:47.275
Jacks, queens, kings, and
aces are mathematical symbols,

1:00:47.277 --> 1:00:49.378
and the equation can be laid
out in sequence of suit.

1:00:49.380 --> 1:00:50.846
We just need to come up

1:00:50.848 --> 1:00:52.714
with another equation that
equals 1680.

1:00:52.716 --> 1:00:54.750
- Sure.

1:00:54.751 --> 1:00:56.785
- And the cards can be taped
to the bottom of the chairs

1:00:56.786 --> 1:00:58.820
in the theater, and it'll be
like a scavenger hunt, too.

1:00:58.822 --> 1:01:00.055
And the seat number on the
ticket

1:01:00.057 --> 1:01:02.290
can be the first clue
of the scavenger hunt.

1:01:02.292 --> 1:01:03.892
- Yeah, yeah, perfect.

1:01:03.894 --> 1:01:04.760
Right, yeah?

1:01:04.762 --> 1:01:05.794
Okay, good.

1:01:05.796 --> 1:01:06.662
Let's go, come.

1:01:06.664 --> 1:01:07.996
(door pounding)

1:01:07.998 --> 1:01:11.233
- Hey, we have your idea, open
up.

1:01:11.235 --> 1:01:12.300
(keys jingling)

1:01:12.302 --> 1:01:13.435
- Yes, great.

1:01:17.708 --> 1:01:18.440
Okay.

1:01:20.444 --> 1:01:21.677
Where is she?

1:01:21.679 --> 1:01:23.011
- No idea.

1:01:23.013 --> 1:01:24.046
- Well, we don't have time.

1:01:24.047 --> 1:01:25.080
Come on.
- No, I'm going to call her.

1:01:25.082 --> 1:01:26.148
- No, no, no, Alex, come one.

1:01:26.150 --> 1:01:27.349
No, let's just take this.

1:01:27.351 --> 1:01:29.885
- Yeah, I'm not gettin' on that,
thanks.

1:01:29.887 --> 1:01:32.020
Look she's gonna answer,
I promise you, I swear.

1:01:32.022 --> 1:01:33.822
- Can you ride a bike?

1:01:33.824 --> 1:01:35.123
- Yeah, I can ride a bike, it's
just,

1:01:35.125 --> 1:01:37.459
I haven't in a long time.

1:01:37.461 --> 1:01:38.894
- You can't.

1:01:38.896 --> 1:01:40.762
Oh, this is so good.

1:01:40.764 --> 1:01:41.763
Okay.

1:01:41.765 --> 1:01:42.831
- It's ringing, it's ringing.

1:01:42.833 --> 1:01:43.921
- Alex, just get on the back.

1:01:43.922 --> 1:01:45.010
- She's gonna answer.
- You know you don't have time

1:01:45.011 --> 1:01:46.099
to wait, she's not answering.

1:01:46.103 --> 1:01:47.135
- No, it takes her a while.

1:01:47.137 --> 1:01:48.236
- We don't have that much time.

1:01:48.238 --> 1:01:49.805
Do you want to be late?

1:01:49.807 --> 1:01:51.373
(soft music)

1:01:51.375 --> 1:01:53.041
Come on.

1:01:53.043 --> 1:01:54.776
- It's still ringing, she's
gonna answer the phone.

1:01:54.778 --> 1:01:56.945
- Oh man, you are scared, you
are scared.

1:01:56.947 --> 1:01:57.913
- I'm not scared.
- Yeah, you are.

1:01:57.915 --> 1:02:00.749
It's fine, you're scared.

1:02:00.751 --> 1:02:02.017
- There you go.
- Will you get on?

1:02:02.019 --> 1:02:03.218
- I'm getting on.

1:02:03.220 --> 1:02:04.419
- All right, here we go.

1:02:04.421 --> 1:02:05.287
- Okay.

1:02:05.289 --> 1:02:06.455
Whoa, okay.

1:02:06.457 --> 1:02:07.389
- [Zoe] You'll be fine.

1:02:07.391 --> 1:02:08.423
(whimpering)

1:02:08.425 --> 1:02:10.075
- [Alex] This is really not fun.

1:02:10.076 --> 1:02:11.726
- [Zoe] We're gonna make it,
don't worry.

1:02:11.729 --> 1:02:13.795
- [Alex] Oh, the bike
doesn't sound too healthy.

1:02:13.797 --> 1:02:14.997
(chuckling)

1:02:14.998 --> 1:02:16.198
I'm too scared to look down at
my watch,

1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:18.333
but I really shouldn't have
enough time.

1:02:18.335 --> 1:02:19.768
We're running late
- We're fine, we're going

1:02:19.770 --> 1:02:20.836
as fast as we can.

1:02:20.838 --> 1:02:22.054
Do you wanna drive?

1:02:22.055 --> 1:02:23.271
- [Alex] No, I really don't
wanna drive.

1:02:23.273 --> 1:02:25.273
- How much do you weigh?

1:02:25.275 --> 1:02:26.475
- I don't weigh that much.

1:02:26.477 --> 1:02:27.342
(grunting)

1:02:27.344 --> 1:02:28.210
That was my knee.

1:02:28.212 --> 1:02:29.377
- Stop complaining.

1:02:29.379 --> 1:02:30.979
- Okay, here we go, nice and
easy.

1:02:30.981 --> 1:02:32.147
- Ooo, I know a shortcut.

1:02:32.149 --> 1:02:33.081
- What?

1:02:33.083 --> 1:02:34.516
(grunting)

1:02:34.518 --> 1:02:37.252
Oh, my God, it's going so fast.

1:02:38.956 --> 1:02:39.888
Tree.

1:02:42.192 --> 1:02:45.260
Okay, anywhere around here,
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1:02:45.262 --> 1:02:46.795
(sighing)

1:02:46.797 --> 1:02:47.462
Okay.

1:02:47.464 --> 1:02:48.396
- Got it.

1:02:49.266 --> 1:02:50.198
How you doing?

1:02:50.200 --> 1:02:51.366
- Yeah, great.

1:02:51.368 --> 1:02:52.534
Never again.

1:02:52.536 --> 1:02:54.336
That's why I don't get on bikes.

1:02:54.338 --> 1:02:56.004
- [Zoe] You're welcome, by the
way.

1:02:56.006 --> 1:02:59.141
- [Alex] Yes, for hurting me.

1:02:59.143 --> 1:03:00.876
- Hey, slow down.

1:03:00.878 --> 1:03:02.377
- Now's really not the time to
slow down.

1:03:02.379 --> 1:03:03.378
This is it.

1:03:03.380 --> 1:03:04.546
- Okay.

1:03:04.548 --> 1:03:06.047
- Four, five, six.

1:03:06.049 --> 1:03:06.982
- Ah.

1:03:07.885 --> 1:03:08.884
(seat creaking)

1:03:08.886 --> 1:03:10.519
Looks familiar.

1:03:10.521 --> 1:03:13.088
- Yeah, just like the good old
days, huh?

1:03:13.090 --> 1:03:14.089
- Mmhmm.

1:03:14.091 --> 1:03:16.424
(soft music)

1:03:16.426 --> 1:03:19.861
- So, who's this mystery couple?

1:03:19.863 --> 1:03:23.198
- Actually it's a friend, I
guess.

1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:25.250
- Oh, first date?

1:03:25.251 --> 1:03:27.301
- Yeah, we've been with
her talking for ages.

1:03:27.304 --> 1:03:28.804
- Mmm.

1:03:28.806 --> 1:03:31.206
Who'd put their faith in you?

1:03:32.409 --> 1:03:34.910
- I mean, it's obviously
working.

1:03:34.912 --> 1:03:36.411
- Mr. Porter?

1:03:36.413 --> 1:03:37.345
Miss.

1:03:38.382 --> 1:03:39.347
- Is that?

1:03:39.349 --> 1:03:40.482
- Yes, it is.

1:03:42.953 --> 1:03:43.985
- Oh, you look handsome.

1:03:43.987 --> 1:03:45.220
- Thank you, Miss.

1:03:45.222 --> 1:03:46.154
- Zoe.

1:03:46.156 --> 1:03:47.222
- Zoe.

1:03:47.224 --> 1:03:49.291
- So, who's the lucky lady?

1:03:49.293 --> 1:03:53.028
- Oh, just someone from my old
work.

1:03:53.030 --> 1:03:54.996
From my corporate days.

1:03:54.998 --> 1:03:57.032
- Oh, that's exciting.

1:03:57.034 --> 1:03:59.101
- I'm a little nervous.

1:03:59.102 --> 1:04:01.169
- Oh, don't worry, it can't
go worse than it did with me.

1:04:01.171 --> 1:04:03.004
- Thanks, just standing here.

1:04:03.006 --> 1:04:04.940
Escott, everything's gonna be
fine.

1:04:04.942 --> 1:04:07.025
I made it very easy.

1:04:07.026 --> 1:04:09.109
Just remember, be a gentleman,
and treat her like a lady.

1:04:09.112 --> 1:04:10.312
- Got it.

1:04:10.314 --> 1:04:11.502
- Wow.

1:04:11.503 --> 1:04:12.691
I wish you would have applied

1:04:12.692 --> 1:04:13.880
some of that good advice to
yourself.

1:04:13.884 --> 1:04:15.584
(chuckling)

1:04:15.586 --> 1:04:16.518
Oh, burn.

1:04:17.387 --> 1:04:19.838
(chuckling)

1:04:19.839 --> 1:04:22.290
Yeah, like do what I say, not
what I do?

1:04:22.292 --> 1:04:24.159
That's what I should listen to.

1:04:24.161 --> 1:04:25.093
Right?
- Yeah.

1:04:25.095 --> 1:04:27.495
(snickering)

1:04:29.266 --> 1:04:32.033
- Right, be a gentleman, be a
lady.

1:04:32.035 --> 1:04:34.069
Treat her like a lady.

1:04:34.071 --> 1:04:36.004
Yes, got it, thank you, Mr.
Porter.

1:04:36.006 --> 1:04:36.938
Zoe.

1:04:38.275 --> 1:04:40.508
- Well, okay, chop chop,
she's waiting for you.

1:04:40.510 --> 1:04:42.210
- Oh.

1:04:42.212 --> 1:04:43.645
- Escott.

1:04:43.647 --> 1:04:45.213
No weapons tonight.

1:04:45.215 --> 1:04:48.216
- Oh, no, no, I returned the
taser.

1:04:49.219 --> 1:04:51.086
It is way too dangerous.

1:04:51.088 --> 1:04:53.021
- Yeah.

1:04:53.022 --> 1:04:54.955
- I got an Airsoft pistol
instead, so I can stay protected

1:04:54.958 --> 1:04:59.094
on the job, and do
paintball in my free time.

1:04:59.096 --> 1:05:00.295
(tongue clicking)

1:05:00.297 --> 1:05:01.496
Double whammy.

1:05:02.666 --> 1:05:05.166
- This should be interesting.

1:05:05.168 --> 1:05:07.302
- Yeah, very interesting.

1:05:08.305 --> 1:05:09.237
Okay.

1:05:10.140 --> 1:05:11.172
- Let's go.

1:05:11.174 --> 1:05:12.624
- Yeah, we should go.

1:05:12.625 --> 1:05:14.075
Yeah, yeah, we should go, okay.

1:05:14.077 --> 1:05:15.043
- Good luck tonight.

1:05:15.045 --> 1:05:16.978
- Thank you, Miss Zoe.

1:05:19.316 --> 1:05:20.666
(clearing throat)

1:05:20.667 --> 1:05:22.017
- So the trick is to take the
suction cup.

1:05:22.019 --> 1:05:22.918
- Mmhmm.

1:05:22.920 --> 1:05:23.652
(suction cup plopping)

1:05:23.654 --> 1:05:25.587
There we go.

1:05:25.588 --> 1:05:27.521
Hold the letter, and then, place
it

1:05:28.959 --> 1:05:31.693
where you want it to go, just
like that.

1:05:31.695 --> 1:05:35.964
And then, the trick is, with
a little twist of your wrist,

1:05:35.966 --> 1:05:38.166
lift the letter off the suction
cup.

1:05:38.168 --> 1:05:39.234
- Yeah, it looks easy.

1:05:39.236 --> 1:05:40.568
Here, give me the stick.

1:05:40.570 --> 1:05:42.304
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1:05:43.407 --> 1:05:44.439
- There you go.

1:05:44.440 --> 1:05:45.472
- So you--
- Take it there.

1:05:45.475 --> 1:05:46.975
- Grab the letter.

1:05:46.977 --> 1:05:48.343
Okay, got it.

1:05:48.345 --> 1:05:49.644
- That's it, that's it.

1:05:49.646 --> 1:05:51.079
- And then,

1:05:51.081 --> 1:05:52.480
- And then hopefully place it.
- Like that?

1:05:52.482 --> 1:05:54.316
- Yeah, yeah.

1:05:54.318 --> 1:05:56.518
- It's not sticking.
- That's it, no, no.

1:05:56.520 --> 1:05:58.219
- Just finesse, just with the
wrist.

1:05:58.221 --> 1:05:59.621
- Like that?
- Like a slight turn here,

1:05:59.623 --> 1:06:01.656
just a slight turn.

1:06:01.658 --> 1:06:02.590
- Perfect.

1:06:03.727 --> 1:06:05.093
(stick clanging)

1:06:05.095 --> 1:06:07.662
Could have done it myself, you
know.

1:06:07.664 --> 1:06:10.632
- Yes, you could have, for sure.

1:06:10.634 --> 1:06:13.468
(bright music)

1:06:13.470 --> 1:06:15.704
- We should get going,
she'll be here soon.

1:06:15.706 --> 1:06:16.638
- Yeah.

1:06:23.380 --> 1:06:24.746
(door rattling)

1:06:24.747 --> 1:06:26.113
- No, no, no, this can't be
happening.

1:06:26.116 --> 1:06:29.084
- Oh.
- Can't be happening.

1:06:29.086 --> 1:06:30.618
- Looking for this?

1:06:33.590 --> 1:06:34.522
- How?

1:06:34.524 --> 1:06:37.258
- You know, Escott is a really
great guy,

1:06:37.260 --> 1:06:40.328
but he is a terrible security
guard.

1:06:41.732 --> 1:06:42.731
- You're amazing.

1:06:42.733 --> 1:06:44.232
(kissing)

1:06:44.234 --> 1:06:45.400
Come, come on.

1:06:45.402 --> 1:06:46.301
- Okay.

1:06:48.005 --> 1:06:49.404
Okay, here we go.

1:06:56.546 --> 1:06:57.746
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1:06:58.715 --> 1:07:00.415
- Here we are, in the theater.

1:07:00.417 --> 1:07:01.549
- The theater.

1:07:01.551 --> 1:07:02.617
(chuckling)

1:07:02.619 --> 1:07:05.353
- So, we're looking for 15, 14.

1:07:07.357 --> 1:07:08.289
- Oh.

1:07:08.291 --> 1:07:09.457
- Oh, after you.

1:07:09.459 --> 1:07:11.292
- Oh, well, thank you.

1:07:11.294 --> 1:07:12.460
- Yeah, okay.

1:07:12.462 --> 1:07:15.247
What does the next card say?

1:07:15.248 --> 1:07:18.033
- A movie you want to see,
jack and queen you got to be.

1:07:18.035 --> 1:07:22.170
- A movie you want to see,
jack and queen you got to be.

1:07:22.172 --> 1:07:23.204
- Exclamation point.

1:07:23.206 --> 1:07:24.773
- Exclamation point.

1:07:24.775 --> 1:07:26.374
- Mmhmm.

1:07:26.376 --> 1:07:27.275
(chair creaking)

1:07:27.277 --> 1:07:28.710
- It's never gonna work.

1:07:28.712 --> 1:07:30.712
- [Escott] Jack and queen you
got to be.

1:07:30.714 --> 1:07:33.648
- Who thought up of
this crazy idea, anyway?

1:07:33.650 --> 1:07:35.316
- Oh, my new boss.

1:07:36.553 --> 1:07:39.087
Yeah, he's a very great man.

1:07:40.524 --> 1:07:42.390
Very wise and gentle.

1:07:45.595 --> 1:07:48.063
I mean, not gentle, per se.

1:07:49.433 --> 1:07:51.666
- What is he even talking about.

1:07:51.668 --> 1:07:52.667
- Oh, yeah.

1:07:54.304 --> 1:07:56.671
And you're happier here than
when you were

1:07:56.673 --> 1:07:58.173
sitting behind the desk?

1:07:58.175 --> 1:07:59.374
- Oh.

1:07:59.376 --> 1:08:00.442
(groaning)

1:08:00.444 --> 1:08:01.777
(laughing)

1:08:01.778 --> 1:08:03.111
- That is true, yeah, I confess.

1:08:03.113 --> 1:08:04.579
And then,

1:08:04.581 --> 1:08:06.147
(groaning)

1:08:06.149 --> 1:08:07.382
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:08:07.384 --> 1:08:09.084
(chuckling)

1:08:09.086 --> 1:08:12.720
- Well, your new boss is very
creative.

1:08:12.722 --> 1:08:14.489
- Okay, maybe it wasn't the best
idea,

1:08:14.491 --> 1:08:18.259
but, you know, I'm just
a literary specialist.

1:08:18.261 --> 1:08:19.394
- I told you.

1:08:19.396 --> 1:08:21.596
Maybe we should give
him a hint or something?

1:08:21.598 --> 1:08:24.232
- And I caught him when he was
trying

1:08:24.234 --> 1:08:27.302
this whole thing out with
Miss Zoe the firs time.

1:08:27.304 --> 1:08:29.370
So, like, oops, my bad.

1:08:29.372 --> 1:08:30.705
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:08:32.609 --> 1:08:35.477
- Wow, so, you're telling me,
that if we're here tonight,

1:08:35.479 --> 1:08:38.213
it's a little bit because of
you.

1:08:38.215 --> 1:08:39.915
(soft music)

1:08:39.916 --> 1:08:41.616
- We could definitely say that.

1:08:41.618 --> 1:08:44.385
It's a little bit because of me.

1:08:44.387 --> 1:08:46.654
(giggling)

1:08:48.358 --> 1:08:49.657
- Well, back to work.

1:08:49.659 --> 1:08:51.493
- Right.
- Yeah.

1:08:51.495 --> 1:08:53.862
- Okay, I don't know where.

1:08:53.864 --> 1:08:55.563
- Wait.

1:08:55.565 --> 1:08:57.699
(seat creaking)

1:08:57.701 --> 1:08:58.633
- Oh.

1:08:59.803 --> 1:09:01.236
Jackpot.

1:09:01.238 --> 1:09:02.504
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

1:09:02.506 --> 1:09:03.371
(giggling)

1:09:03.373 --> 1:09:04.305
- What?

1:09:05.242 --> 1:09:07.542
- The name is Scott.

1:09:07.544 --> 1:09:08.476
Escott.

1:09:09.379 --> 1:09:10.578
(giggling)

1:09:10.580 --> 1:09:11.613
- Boom.

1:09:11.615 --> 1:09:13.481
- I can't believe it.

1:09:14.317 --> 1:09:15.917
- So, Escott.
- Okay.

1:09:17.687 --> 1:09:20.822
- What do we do with these cards
now?

1:09:21.725 --> 1:09:24.209
- I don't know.

1:09:24.210 --> 1:09:26.694
Jack of spades, queen of
hearts, ace of diamonds.

1:09:27.797 --> 1:09:29.931
- Hey, what movie are we
gonna see tonight, anyway?

1:09:29.933 --> 1:09:32.534
- Oh no, I can't say that, it's
a secret.

1:09:32.536 --> 1:09:33.735
- Come on.

1:09:33.737 --> 1:09:35.504
- No.

1:09:35.505 --> 1:09:37.272
- Come on, am I gonna like it?

1:09:39.242 --> 1:09:42.644
- Well, okay, it's this
wonderful movie.

1:09:42.646 --> 1:09:46.648
It's about an elder man who
starts a new job, and he

1:09:46.650 --> 1:09:49.951
- Falls for the massage
therapist?

1:09:49.953 --> 1:09:52.554
(soft music)

1:09:54.324 --> 1:09:56.624
- I love that movie.

1:09:56.626 --> 1:09:57.559
- Yeah.

1:10:04.334 --> 1:10:06.734
- When do we actually see it?

1:10:08.438 --> 1:10:09.370
- I dunno.

1:10:11.308 --> 1:10:12.707
It's kind of a new concept.

1:10:12.709 --> 1:10:15.310
Maybe they're working out the
kinks.

1:10:15.312 --> 1:10:16.477
- Why have they stopped?

1:10:16.479 --> 1:10:18.479
- I dunno, maybe they're stuck?

1:10:18.481 --> 1:10:22.217
- Jack of spades, queen of
hearts, ace of diamonds.

1:10:22.219 --> 1:10:23.585
Wait a minute.

1:10:23.587 --> 1:10:24.819
Look.

1:10:24.821 --> 1:10:26.354
Your under seat.

1:10:28.758 --> 1:10:29.924
Oh.

1:10:29.926 --> 1:10:31.459
Under your seat.

1:10:32.896 --> 1:10:33.828
So.
- Oh.

1:10:35.899 --> 1:10:37.465
Oh.

1:10:37.467 --> 1:10:40.335
(paper rustling)

1:10:41.805 --> 1:10:44.339
(chuckling)

1:10:49.512 --> 1:10:50.745
- You're a genius.

1:10:50.747 --> 1:10:53.781
No, honestly, that's amazing.

1:10:53.783 --> 1:10:55.283
- You know, people are pretty
intelligent,

1:10:55.285 --> 1:10:57.986
if you give them the benefit of
the doubt.

1:10:57.988 --> 1:11:01.923
Don't worry, you'll get there
someday, if you work at it.

1:11:01.925 --> 1:11:02.790
- [Alex] Thank you.

1:11:02.792 --> 1:11:04.325
So, what's next?

1:11:07.364 --> 1:11:09.697
- Well, the movie is
about an hour and a half.

1:11:09.699 --> 1:11:13.501
So, that gives you some
time to surprise me.

1:11:15.705 --> 1:11:18.373
(soft music)

1:11:18.375 --> 1:11:21.442
- Do you think they forgot about
us?

1:11:29.986 --> 1:11:31.452
(popcorn crunching)

1:11:31.454 --> 1:11:33.054
- Now, that's good popcorn.

1:11:33.056 --> 1:11:36.724
- Oh, it's always better
when you make it yourself.

1:11:36.726 --> 1:11:39.060
(chuckling)

1:11:42.666 --> 1:11:43.765
(kissing)

1:11:43.766 --> 1:11:44.865
- You know, I'm actually not
this easy.

1:11:44.868 --> 1:11:45.800
(giggling)

1:11:45.802 --> 1:11:46.868
- Yeah, right.

1:11:46.870 --> 1:11:49.237
- No, no, to be honest,

1:11:49.238 --> 1:11:51.605
I actually wanted to show you my
new film.

1:11:51.608 --> 1:11:52.841
- Please, don't.

1:11:52.842 --> 1:11:54.075
- No, it's really good, I
promise you.

1:11:54.077 --> 1:11:56.978
It's about the guys who
live in the dope walk.

1:11:56.980 --> 1:11:58.913
You know, traffic lights.

1:11:58.915 --> 1:12:00.899
- Mmhmm.

1:12:00.900 --> 1:12:02.884
- The big bread hand, and his
friend, the little white guy.

1:12:02.886 --> 1:12:05.019
Oh, do you what you want.

1:12:06.423 --> 1:12:08.589
- No more festival films.

1:12:08.591 --> 1:12:11.693
- Not even at least one a month?

1:12:11.695 --> 1:12:13.061
- Year.

1:12:13.063 --> 1:12:13.995
- Year?

1:12:14.864 --> 1:12:15.997
I'm a film connoisseur.

1:12:15.999 --> 1:12:17.332
It's my work.

1:12:19.002 --> 1:12:20.802
- We're ready, okay.

1:12:23.373 --> 1:12:25.340
You can start the movie now.

1:12:25.342 --> 1:12:26.074
Thanks.

1:12:27.410 --> 1:12:28.676
(giggling)

1:12:28.678 --> 1:12:30.111
(clearing throat)

1:12:30.112 --> 1:12:31.545
- [Alex] And now, for
our feature presentation.

1:12:31.548 --> 1:12:33.781
(imitating a trumpet fanfare)

1:12:33.783 --> 1:12:35.883
Go low, deep voice, manly.

1:12:35.885 --> 1:12:39.053
(singing in a French)

1:12:39.055 --> 1:12:40.521
- Now that you have this new
concept,

1:12:40.523 --> 1:12:42.924
you'll probably need a project
manager.

1:12:42.926 --> 1:12:44.759
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1:12:44.761 --> 1:12:47.061
Do you have any ideas?

1:12:47.063 --> 1:12:48.763
- I know a girl.

1:12:48.765 --> 1:12:49.731
- Okay.

1:12:49.733 --> 1:12:53.134
(singing in a French)

1:12:53.136 --> 1:12:57.405
- And her first mission
as project manager,

1:12:57.407 --> 1:12:58.106
(chair sliding)

1:12:58.108 --> 1:12:58.973
(sighing)

1:12:58.975 --> 1:13:01.542
is to pick a better film.

1:13:01.544 --> 1:13:02.844
- Oh.

1:13:02.846 --> 1:13:04.545
Yeah, yeah.

1:13:04.547 --> 1:13:06.547
I actually watched one the
other day, it's really good.

1:13:06.549 --> 1:13:08.816
The Girl with the Invisible
Violin.

1:13:08.818 --> 1:13:09.751
- Oh, really?

1:13:09.753 --> 1:13:11.152
- Really good.

1:13:11.154 --> 1:13:12.453
- Missed that one.

1:13:12.455 --> 1:13:13.721
- You should see it.

1:13:13.723 --> 1:13:16.691
(singing in a French)

1:13:16.693 --> 1:13:18.559
Yeah, it has a really strong
female lead.

1:13:18.561 --> 1:13:19.594
- She sounds great.

1:13:19.596 --> 1:13:20.762
- Yeah, very great.

1:13:20.764 --> 1:13:22.864
Lot of depth, lot of conviction.

1:13:22.866 --> 1:13:24.465
- Mmm.

1:13:24.467 --> 1:13:28.703
(singing in a French)

1:13:28.705 --> 1:13:31.406
(bright music)

1:13:34.411 --> 1:13:38.079
- Her violin playing, a
little left to be desired.

1:13:38.081 --> 1:13:39.881
But, you know.

1:13:39.883 --> 1:13:41.616
(giggling)

1:13:41.618 --> 1:13:42.583
- I'll have to see it.

1:13:42.585 --> 1:13:43.785
- Yeah.

1:13:43.787 --> 1:13:44.836
It's great.

1:13:44.837 --> 1:13:45.886
- Sounds like my kind of film.

1:13:45.889 --> 1:13:46.888
- I think you'd like it.

1:13:46.890 --> 1:13:47.889
Super charming.

1:13:47.891 --> 1:13:48.923
- Witty?

1:13:48.925 --> 1:13:49.791
- Very.

1:13:49.793 --> 1:13:50.658
- Hilarious, probably.

1:13:50.660 --> 1:13:52.059
- A laugh aloud caper.

1:13:52.061 --> 1:13:54.662
I love a bit of fake violins.

1:13:54.664 --> 1:13:55.596
- [Zoe] Who doesn't, really?

1:13:55.598 --> 1:13:56.697
- [Alex] Fake Yo-Yo Ma.

1:13:56.699 --> 1:13:57.565
- [Zoe] Sounds quirky.

1:13:57.567 --> 1:13:58.433
- [Alex] Fake Bach.

1:13:58.435 --> 1:13:59.100
- [Zoe] Fun.

1:13:59.102 --> 1:13:59.934
- [Alex] Fake Mozart.

1:13:59.936 --> 1:14:01.469
- [Zoe] Charming.

1:14:01.471 --> 1:14:04.872
- [Alex] Know any other
violinists?

1:14:04.874 --> 1:14:08.910
(singing in a French)

1:16:24.981 --> 1:16:27.982
(soft, slow music)
