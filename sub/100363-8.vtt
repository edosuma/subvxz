It wants out.

‐ Have you tried
letting it out?

He can't cast there, so.

It's horrific.

‐ The Takers are swarming.
‐ It's my fault.

01:36.129 --> 01:38.799
They're swarming because Seb
summoned them with a spell

using the gold I gave him.

I go away to my nephew's

01:56.450 --> 01:58.218
What?
We're all thinking it.

01:58.251 --> 02:01.288
‐ Eli's Torah portion was
all about the sanctity of life,

02:01.321 --> 02:03.156
and I found it very moving.

02:03.190 --> 02:06.994
So, can't we, I don't know,
peacefully overthrow him?

We're talking a powerful,
immortal magician?

Doubt you can just walk up
and stab the guy.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.711

02:24.745 --> 02:26.647
The Dark King survived
seven assassination attempts

02:26.680 --> 02:27.681
since he took our thrones.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.950
‐ Must be big magic
keeping him alive.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.085
We have to figure out
what it is.

02:32.119 --> 02:32.886
Find out his weakness.

02:32.919 --> 02:34.021
‐ You're on board
with this too?

02:34.054 --> 02:36.757
‐ I mean, I'm here to stop
an apocalypse that happens

02:36.790 --> 02:39.693
'cause an evil force invades
from a distant realm.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.061
That sounds like the Takers.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.396

We kill the Dark King,

in, stop the apocalypse.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.671
how are we gonna get
close enough to the Dark King

02:50.704 --> 02:52.372
to learn his weakness
and assassinate him?

Plus, he's always dismissing

03:02.315 --> 03:05.686
his guards
when you come around.

03:05.719 --> 03:08.288
‐ Why does me liking somebody
always end up with them dying?

03:08.321 --> 03:10.190

tell your friends, Eliot.

03:10.223 --> 03:12.159
‐ That I don't want
to save Fillory

03:12.192 --> 03:13.860
because I caught feelings?

03:13.894 --> 03:14.928
‐ I'm saying
they should know how you feel

03:14.961 --> 03:17.397
before they try to make you
do something you regret.

03:17.431 --> 03:20.067
‐ No, I'll just look selfish,
Charlton.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.035
And I'll still end up having
to do it.

03:22.069 --> 03:25.038

‐ Um...

03:25.072 --> 03:27.908

03:27.941 --> 03:29.109
Fillory needs
the Dark King dead

03:29.142 --> 03:31.278
and I am
the obvious inside man.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.013

It's that Eliot.

03:35.582 --> 03:38.452

I know I'm just the guy

03:38.485 --> 03:40.120
who has to live inside your
tragic remembrances and all

03:40.153 --> 03:41.488
but I truly don't understand

03:41.521 --> 03:43.523
why you won't
at least tell her.

I'm not sure I can

on a boy who's bad for you.

03:50.797 --> 03:51.698
Happens to all of us,

03:51.732 --> 03:54.334
but how do we get crushes
out of our system?

We bang them out.

04:00.307 --> 04:02.109

04:02.142 --> 04:03.710
except for the part where now
I have to murder the guy

04:03.744 --> 04:05.612
I just hypothetically
slept with,

that shouldn't really happen

04:09.583 --> 04:11.985
Fillory does need this,

04:12.018 --> 04:14.154
so if you can't do it,
tell me now.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.328
I don't.
I can't.

but let me help make
it simpler.

04:26.299 --> 04:28.368
Say you didn't have
to kill him yourself.

04:28.401 --> 04:31.104

You just said it.

I have what they want.

41:08.032 --> 41:08.933
‐ I don't think that's gonna be

41:08.967 --> 41:11.669
the last person or thing
to come after it.

41:13.871 --> 41:15.440
The hell was Coldwater doing

41:15.473 --> 41:17.809
with instructions
to something so powerful?

41:17.842 --> 41:19.677
‐ Yeah.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.614
I have no idea.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.884
‐ Jesus Christ, El.
You had one job:

41:26.918 --> 41:28.720
Don't blow up
my relationship with Josh.

41:28.753 --> 41:29.721
And what did you do?

41:29.754 --> 41:30.621
‐ I'm sorry.

41:30.655 --> 41:32.790
There's no way
to avoid that conversation.

41:32.824 --> 41:36.027
He's just
so goddamn persistent.

41:36.060 --> 41:37.195
‐ Tell me about it.

41:37.228 --> 41:38.262
By the by,

41:38.296 --> 41:40.298
Charlton's gonna go hang out
in your beach memories

41:40.331 --> 41:41.232
for a while.

41:41.265 --> 41:43.201
Think the whole Seb thing
was hard on him.

41:43.234 --> 41:46.004
‐ So um, what did
you and Seb talk about?

41:46.037 --> 41:48.840
You know, before?

41:48.873 --> 41:50.174
‐ Don't do this to yourself.

41:50.208 --> 41:51.876
‐ I ended your relationship.

41:51.909 --> 41:54.746
Seems like I deserve whatever
pain's coming my way.

41:54.779 --> 41:56.948
‐ That wasn't your fault.

41:56.981 --> 41:58.750
You were just dealing
with some shit I set up

41:58.783 --> 42:00.051
way before you took over.

42:00.084 --> 42:01.753
‐ So in summation,

42:01.786 --> 42:04.655
we're both equally skilled at
destroying our own happiness?

42:04.689 --> 42:06.457
‐ Yeah.

42:06.491 --> 42:10.161
Well, at least we used
our powers for good?

42:12.530 --> 42:13.965
‐ How fucked up is it
that I miss him?

42:13.998 --> 42:18.236
‐ El, there's
nothing wrong with you.

42:18.269 --> 42:19.170
He was hot and complicated.

42:19.203 --> 42:21.339
Those are the ones
worth banging.

42:21.372 --> 42:23.608
[inhales deeply] You've just
had some shitty luck

42:23.641 --> 42:25.209
with boys so far,
that's all.

It doesn't mean
you don't deserve love

42:27.211 --> 42:30.314
or that you won't ever find it.

42:30.348 --> 42:33.785
‐ Well, at least I have
better luck with friends.
