Put the gun away
or I'm leaving right now.

You're safe. And you are?

18:14.110 --> 18:16.946

18:16.980 --> 18:18.515
You're supposed
to have some liquor for me?

18:18.548 --> 18:19.683

Wedding present.
We're not big drinkers.

to a Freedom Center.

I hear they just ship you off
to some other facility?

18:49.479 --> 18:52.182

What are your symptoms?

18:55.252 --> 18:57.621
I'm fatigued.

18:57.654 --> 18:59.823
I get these bruises

18:59.856 --> 19:02.559
from doing almost nothing.

19:04.328 --> 19:06.162
And I get muscle cramps.

Are you supposed to be

those Partnership

The taste, I don't like it.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.535
- Mm-hm.

19:45.569 --> 19:48.338
You have scorbutus,
also known as scurvy.

Your dietary intake

20:28.011 --> 20:30.079

I don't make the rules.

You and Dad would
take me to the zoo.

31:09.252 --> 31:11.720
You would do well to hurry.

32:05.774 --> 32:08.444
...I feel like
I'm failing them, you know?

32:08.477 --> 32:10.613

32:10.646 --> 32:13.516
- Well...
- No, no.

Our luck is gonna change.

32:19.355 --> 32:22.191
- Hey, you'll see.

32:31.534 --> 32:33.869
- What would I do
without you?

32:40.909 --> 32:44.613
- Did you ever hear
the farmer's daughter's joke

32:44.647 --> 32:46.115
about the exterminator

32:46.149 --> 32:48.484
from New York City?

32:48.517 --> 32:51.554
- (laughing): No. Never.

32:51.587 --> 32:53.689
- He was big

32:53.722 --> 32:56.959
and handsome

32:56.992 --> 32:58.727
and had a black beard

32:58.761 --> 33:00.529
and a dangerous accent?

33:00.563 --> 33:04.333
- Danger, huh?
I like it so far.

33:05.934 --> 33:08.871
- One day, this naive farm girl
called up and said,

33:08.904 --> 33:11.340
"I think I have a snake
in my bedroom."

33:11.374 --> 33:14.510
- "A snake."
Whoa. Is it poisonous?

33:14.543 --> 33:17.213
- I don't know.
Are pythons poisonous?

33:17.246 --> 33:20.516
- No. But tell me anyway.

33:20.549 --> 33:22.318
- Well, he went into her bedroom

33:22.351 --> 33:25.188
and he looked under her bed

33:25.221 --> 33:27.523
and in her lingerie drawer.

33:27.556 --> 33:29.158
- Oooh...
- But he couldn't

33:29.192 --> 33:30.693
find no snake.

33:30.726 --> 33:32.695
(bird cawing)

33:32.728 --> 33:34.497
(Fet chuckling)

33:34.530 --> 33:36.232
- And then what?

33:36.265 --> 33:40.469
She said, uh,
"Here, let me help you look."

33:42.605 --> 33:44.873
Oh, you don't like that one?

33:44.907 --> 33:48.311
Oh, it's more personal fantasy
than joke, I guess.

33:49.978 --> 33:51.780

34:40.596 --> 34:42.765
- How fares
our young master

34:42.798 --> 34:45.100
after the kill?

34:45.134 --> 34:47.470
- Master,

34:47.503 --> 34:50.506
the boy has no interest
in our work,

34:50.539 --> 34:53.409
nor aptitude for it.

34:53.442 --> 34:55.144
He's incapable
of shouldering

34:55.178 --> 34:57.646
any serious responsibility.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.815
- Great leaders
are not born

34:59.848 --> 35:02.285
but forged, Thomas.

35:02.318 --> 35:04.787
- Leaders, Sire?

35:04.820 --> 35:06.522
- This vessel I claimed

35:06.555 --> 35:09.458
in a moment of necessity,
not choice.

35:09.492 --> 35:11.194
- Master, you don't mean to--

35:11.227 --> 35:13.662
- Perhaps my next choice

35:13.696 --> 35:15.331
should be custom-tailored

35:15.364 --> 35:18.501
from the finest human cloth.

35:18.534 --> 35:20.569
- Forgive me, Master, but...

35:22.238 --> 35:26.074
...the boy is most unworthy.

35:28.744 --> 35:31.480
- You question my judgement?

35:33.482 --> 35:36.685
There are many reasons for us
to keep the boy.

35:36.719 --> 35:39.322
Goodweather is out there
somewhere.

35:39.355 --> 35:41.123
He will not allow the Born

35:41.156 --> 35:42.958
or Setrakian to move against me

35:42.991 --> 35:46.729
so long as I have his son.

35:46.762 --> 35:49.498
- As you know, my Lord,

35:49.532 --> 35:53.035
my legion is searching for them.

35:53.068 --> 35:56.572
As well as rounding up
every nuclear weapon.

35:58.707 --> 36:01.477
- Bring them to me
on their knees,

36:01.510 --> 36:05.047
then we will need
the boy no longer.

36:05.080 --> 36:08.851
- That is my greatest desire.

36:08.884 --> 36:10.786
Master.

36:12.288 --> 36:14.056
- One more thing.

36:14.089 --> 36:17.426
The boy deserves
a trophy for his kill.

36:17.460 --> 36:21.129
I have an idea
for a reward.

36:22.631 --> 36:24.633
(sheep bleating)

36:37.546 --> 36:40.283
- You're all women.

36:40.316 --> 36:43.419
- Oh!

36:43.452 --> 36:46.422
Oh, God!

36:46.455 --> 36:47.956
Ugh!

36:52.761 --> 36:55.264
(chicken clucking)

36:55.298 --> 36:56.799
Charlotte?

37:01.069 --> 37:03.105
Is anybody there?!

37:05.007 --> 37:06.375
- Save your breath.

37:06.409 --> 37:09.412
Your lady friend's
gone, dude.

37:09.445 --> 37:11.780
- Gone where?

37:11.814 --> 37:13.816
- They took her to turn her
to their cause.

37:13.849 --> 37:16.218
Captured her.

37:16.251 --> 37:17.953
- Who are you?
- I'm slave labour

37:17.986 --> 37:20.923
whenever they need a hole dug
or a tire patched.

37:20.956 --> 37:23.258
- You got, uh...

37:25.628 --> 37:27.129
You got friends coming for you?

37:27.162 --> 37:29.598
- No. You?

37:29.632 --> 37:30.833
- I hope so.

37:35.003 --> 37:37.640
- I had a lady, like you,

37:37.673 --> 37:41.310
then after the Illumination,
I went out to find her.

37:41.344 --> 37:44.079
Only to discover she was
shacking up with someone else.

37:44.112 --> 37:46.248
On my way back,
nursing my pain,

37:46.281 --> 37:49.251
I stopped in at a roadhouse
that still served

37:49.284 --> 37:52.321
grain alcohol.

37:52.355 --> 37:55.324
That's the last thing
I remember.

37:55.358 --> 37:57.760
Woke up here with a knot
on my head just like you.

37:57.793 --> 38:00.796
- I'm sorry to hear that,
friend, but...

38:00.829 --> 38:03.131
I just, uh...

38:03.165 --> 38:05.368
I just need a minute
to think here,

38:05.401 --> 38:07.770
get my head together, please.
- Yeah, all right. No problem.

38:07.803 --> 38:10.172
A guy like me,

38:10.205 --> 38:12.641
a provider with food, gas,

38:12.675 --> 38:15.811
and ammo to spare,
and Nicole chooses a dude

38:15.844 --> 38:18.647
with a neck tattoo on
instead? I...

38:18.681 --> 38:20.849
- Food, gas, and ammo, you say?

38:20.883 --> 38:24.553
- Damn straight.
Power and sewer.

38:24.587 --> 38:26.655
A nice, soft bed.

38:29.091 --> 38:31.159
- Roman?

38:31.193 --> 38:33.328
Hey?

38:33.362 --> 38:37.032
How, uh...

38:37.065 --> 38:39.502
how far is this little nest
of yours, man? Where is it?

38:39.535 --> 38:42.070
- Not far.
- Huh!

38:43.939 --> 38:44.940
- What?

38:48.844 --> 38:51.547
- You wouldn't be referring
to a government missile silo

38:51.580 --> 38:54.717
by any chance, would you?
- What gives you that idea?

38:54.750 --> 38:57.920
- Your shirt.
It says you worked at

38:57.953 --> 39:01.590
a government missile silo.
- That's classified.

39:01.624 --> 39:04.760
- So you did work
at a government missile silo.

39:04.793 --> 39:06.662
(Fet panting)

39:06.695 --> 39:09.097
Did you launch?

39:09.131 --> 39:11.900
- What?
- Did you launch?

39:11.934 --> 39:14.002
- Why do you care?

39:14.036 --> 39:16.439
- Hey,

39:16.472 --> 39:19.207
I'm... I'm just trying
to make conversation, Roman.

39:19.241 --> 39:22.244
You know? Getting to know you?

39:28.250 --> 39:31.386
- No, we didn't get the command.

39:31.420 --> 39:33.355
Standing orders said
to hold in place,

39:33.388 --> 39:36.391
and we did.
Couple of months went by,

39:36.425 --> 39:39.762
then we start to get the pirate
broadcasts about the surface world.

39:39.795 --> 39:43.666
New York
and San Francisco, gone.

39:45.267 --> 39:47.402
- It's not true, but go on.

39:47.436 --> 39:50.238
- That's it, man.

39:50.272 --> 39:51.474
(exhaling)

39:51.507 --> 39:54.042
If I was smart,
I would have never left.

39:54.076 --> 39:56.278
- If I could get us
out of here,

39:56.311 --> 39:58.781
you can give me directions
to your missile silo, right?

39:58.814 --> 40:01.383
- Hah! So you can
set up housekeeping

40:01.416 --> 40:03.586
with your lady? No thanks.
- No,

40:03.619 --> 40:06.655
I'm after a different kind of prize.
- What's that?

40:06.689 --> 40:10.859
- A thermonuclear warhead.

40:22.004 --> 40:24.473
(hard rock music playing)

40:34.517 --> 40:37.019
- ♪ Kicking back the day

40:37.052 --> 40:39.622
♪ I just attend
to what's been go-- ♪

40:39.655 --> 40:41.389
(music turned off)
(Zack panting)

40:43.959 --> 40:46.662
- Hey. Just, uh,

40:46.695 --> 40:48.831
messing around.

40:48.864 --> 40:51.634
- I'm here to clean.
- Cool.

40:51.667 --> 40:54.002
(snarling)
- Ah!

40:54.036 --> 40:56.338
Oh!
- Hey!

40:56.371 --> 40:58.406
Back up!

40:59.542 --> 41:01.009
Don't worry.

41:01.043 --> 41:04.680
It's fine. Mostly harmless.

41:04.713 --> 41:06.982
(creature snarling)
- Uh...

41:07.015 --> 41:10.586
Um, I'm just gonna clean up
some of the stuff.

41:13.756 --> 41:16.324
- I suppose I...

41:16.358 --> 41:18.326
should clean this up
myself, huh?

41:21.096 --> 41:22.865
So, uh,

41:22.898 --> 41:25.801
you'll be working here
all the time now?

41:25.834 --> 41:28.070
- Guess so.

41:30.539 --> 41:33.876
- It's cool.
(creature snarling)

41:38.446 --> 41:41.516
(man groaning in pain)

41:51.560 --> 41:54.162
- It's rough, but it'll do.

41:54.196 --> 41:56.699
The next 24 hours
are critical.

41:56.732 --> 41:59.267
Keep the wound
covered and clean.

41:59.301 --> 42:00.869
The danger is infection.

42:00.903 --> 42:04.439
If you have any connections,
penicillin's always a good bet.

42:04.472 --> 42:06.408
(distant, indistinct talking)
- Where are you going?

42:06.441 --> 42:09.544
- Away from here.
(gun cocking)

42:15.283 --> 42:17.552
Look,

42:17.586 --> 42:19.788
you have your mission;
I have mine.

42:19.822 --> 42:23.659
- What's yours?
- Staying alive.

42:24.893 --> 42:27.362
Staying human.

42:27.395 --> 42:28.897
(injured man coughing)

42:31.133 --> 42:33.368
- Fine, go.

42:33.401 --> 42:35.537
Only thinking
about yourself.

42:35.570 --> 42:38.540
You're why the world
is the way it is.

42:38.573 --> 42:41.109
- More than you know.

42:47.315 --> 42:49.818
You have food?
- Some.

42:49.852 --> 42:52.955
- Supplies?
- Maybe.

42:52.988 --> 42:55.057
- 24 hours,

42:55.090 --> 42:57.425
I'll take care
of your brother.

42:57.459 --> 42:59.895
But you give me
food and gear

42:59.928 --> 43:02.264
so I can set off on my own
in exchange.

43:05.200 --> 43:06.334
Deal?

43:23.218 --> 43:26.188
- Help! Someone, help!
- Roman!

43:26.221 --> 43:28.423
- Hey. He hasn't
moved a muscle.

43:28.456 --> 43:30.158
I think he might
still be breathing--

43:30.192 --> 43:31.626
(gun cocking)

43:33.528 --> 43:35.630
- See if he's alive.

43:45.841 --> 43:47.042
(woman groaning)

43:47.075 --> 43:48.610
- Easy. I don't want
to hurt anyone,

43:48.643 --> 43:50.713
but I will if I have to.

43:50.746 --> 43:52.147
(machine-gun fire)

43:54.316 --> 43:57.485
- Drop your gun! - Do it now before
my friend comes through that door.

43:57.519 --> 43:59.788
And throw me the keys!
- Drop it!

43:59.822 --> 44:02.624
Throw it down!

44:02.657 --> 44:04.426
(gun clanking on floor)
- Keys! Come on!

44:11.399 --> 44:15.403
Well, your timing's impeccable.

44:15.437 --> 44:16.638
(women gasping)

44:16.671 --> 44:20.308
- You were the one
who got yourself captured.

44:20.342 --> 44:22.978
- How did you find us?
- Once I'd realized

44:23.011 --> 44:25.313
you were gone, your trail
was easy to follow.

44:25.347 --> 44:28.650
- It was probably my aftershave.

44:28.683 --> 44:31.086
So, Quinlan,

44:31.119 --> 44:33.255
this is my new friend Roman.

44:33.288 --> 44:35.257
Roman, Quinlan.

44:35.290 --> 44:37.692
(chain clanking)
Roman used to work

44:37.726 --> 44:39.494
at a missile base
down the street.

44:39.527 --> 44:41.329
- Is there a weapon?

44:41.363 --> 44:44.767
- So he says.
- Once again,

44:44.800 --> 44:47.736
Vasiliy Fet falls
into a pile of manure

44:47.770 --> 44:50.605
and crawls out
smelling of roses.

44:50.638 --> 44:52.440
- Well, that's my superpower.

44:52.474 --> 44:55.443
Let's go!
Let's go get our nuke!
