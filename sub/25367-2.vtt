"The Affair"

00:06.008 --> 00:08.145
- You look happy.
- A change is nice.

00:08.245 --> 00:09.950
Are you ever coming home?

00:10.151 --> 00:11.840
I don't think so.

00:12.018 --> 00:13.871
- Where you from?
- Um, Queens.

00:13.948 --> 00:15.338
Queens? I thought you said...

00:15.415 --> 00:18.536
I came with my mom
when I was ten.

00:18.807 --> 00:19.871
From Ecuador.

00:19.939 --> 00:21.223
I'm undocumented.

00:21.291 --> 00:23.168
Luisa,
I promise I will be

00:23.245 --> 00:24.259
faithful to you.

00:24.336 --> 00:26.655
I want you to trust me
above all others,

00:26.732 --> 00:28.973
and I want to be worthy
of your trust.

00:29.050 --> 00:30.844
I don't know
who Joanie's father is.

00:30.921 --> 00:32.642
What? I-I don't understand.

00:32.719 --> 00:34.270
I slept with Cole.

00:34.815 --> 00:37.051
Right around the time
I got pregnant.

00:37.245 --> 00:39.035
Six fucking months.

00:39.112 --> 00:40.260
No explanation, no warning.

00:40.337 --> 00:41.926
I'm better now.

00:42.049 --> 00:44.199
And I'm back, and I'm not
gonna leave her again.

00:44.276 --> 00:46.083
I'm still her mother.
She needs me.

00:46.160 --> 00:47.676
I was at Woodlawn, and I was

00:47.753 --> 00:50.111
counseling a grieving mother,
and it went so well

00:50.188 --> 00:51.590
they've offered me a job.

00:51.667 --> 00:53.856
What about the Lobster Roll?
What if we bought it?

00:54.002 --> 00:56.169
Okay, so, uh,
how's it gonna work?

00:56.322 --> 00:58.075
I thought we could ask Alison.

00:58.152 --> 00:59.499
If what's
holding you back

00:59.576 --> 01:01.274
from this is the fear that

01:01.351 --> 01:03.225
it might lead to me
getting back together

01:03.302 --> 01:05.428
with my ex-wife
who cheated on me,

01:05.534 --> 01:07.371
that's not ever
going to happen.

01:07.540 --> 01:10.066
I'll try and leave you
alone, okay? I...

01:10.212 --> 01:13.293
I don't want to make anything
more difficult for you.

01:16.291 --> 01:17.704
I built
this whole life.

01:17.781 --> 01:21.058
I am building a whole house
just to prove to everybody

01:21.135 --> 01:22.978
that I don't love you anymore.

01:23.055 --> 01:24.785
But the truth is that I do.

01:25.108 --> 01:26.683
I'm tired of pretending

01:26.799 --> 01:28.071
that I don't.

01:28.502 --> 01:29.801
I love you,

01:29.990 --> 01:32.202
but this is your
decision to make.

01:32.279 --> 01:34.660
This is my home.
Our home.

01:34.853 --> 01:36.549
If you'll still have me.

01:37.381 --> 01:39.207
I'll still have you.

03:19.372 --> 03:20.372
Hey.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.928
We leaving or what?

04:18.355 --> 04:20.050
You better
watch and learn.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.309
Oh, sh...!

04:21.523 --> 04:23.446
Sorry about that,
Grandpa.

04:25.304 --> 04:26.773
Rad board.

04:29.804 --> 04:31.759
Hey. Hey, you.

04:32.883 --> 04:34.923
Would you mind moving
a little to the left, buddy?

04:52.277 --> 04:53.639
Motherfucker.

04:53.716 --> 04:55.312
Hey, sexy.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.045
I thought I'd catch you
still in the water.

04:58.122 --> 04:59.248
Look at this shit.

04:59.325 --> 05:00.593
What happened?

05:00.679 --> 05:02.983
Somebody must have backed into
me as they were pulling out.

05:03.060 --> 05:04.117
Just now?

05:04.194 --> 05:06.381
Yes, when I was in the water.

05:06.458 --> 05:07.656
I gotta find a new break.

05:07.733 --> 05:09.069
I mean, look at
this fucking place.

05:09.146 --> 05:11.181
There used to be five, six
surfers in the water, max.

05:11.258 --> 05:12.774
Now it's like Malibu.

05:13.295 --> 05:14.520
Here.

05:15.038 --> 05:16.171
Thank you.

05:16.351 --> 05:18.767
- You didn't have to bring this to me.
- I missed you.

05:21.093 --> 05:22.882
Oh, shit.

05:23.304 --> 05:25.539
Hey. I got that meeting
with the Marshall Group,

05:25.616 --> 05:27.436
and I promised Caleb
I'd talk to him beforehand.

05:27.513 --> 05:28.806
Do you mind?

05:30.374 --> 05:33.142
I don't think we can
do it ourselves, Caleb.

05:33.410 --> 05:35.172
I'm not saying
it's not scalable.

05:35.249 --> 05:36.743
I'm just saying
that I think the market

05:36.820 --> 05:38.657
is inundated
with that kind of food.

05:38.840 --> 05:41.543
Legal Seafood, Red Lobster,
Long John Silver's.

05:41.620 --> 05:42.725
And besides,
we have no

05:42.802 --> 05:44.113
marketing
or advertising budget.

05:44.190 --> 05:46.826
If we were going to
franchise ourselves, we...

05:47.154 --> 05:48.873
Because that's what
they're paying us for.

05:48.950 --> 05:51.316
The franchisees need support.

05:51.931 --> 05:54.652
Yes, the brand
and also the advertising.

05:54.756 --> 05:55.740
Think about McDonald's.

05:55.817 --> 05:57.818
It's not like
each one of those franchisees

05:57.895 --> 05:59.638
is paying for their own TV ads.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.509
Oh, shit.

06:03.471 --> 06:04.846
What's up?

06:05.097 --> 06:06.305
Oh, shit.

06:06.921 --> 06:09.034
Hold on. Hey, I-I gotta
call you back.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.192
Fuck, fuck.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.708
Do you know him?

06:20.837 --> 06:22.080
I don't think so.

06:22.157 --> 06:23.649
It's okay. Hey, it's okay.

06:23.726 --> 06:24.774
Let me do the talking.

06:24.842 --> 06:26.162
- Yeah.
- Roll down your window.

06:29.614 --> 06:30.731
Hi, Officer.

06:30.808 --> 06:32.013
Is there a problem?

06:32.166 --> 06:33.248
Is this your car, ma'am?

06:33.325 --> 06:34.691
Mine, actually.

06:34.768 --> 06:35.863
And you are?

06:36.056 --> 06:37.156
Cole Lockhart.

06:37.233 --> 06:38.526
We own
the Lobster Roll.

06:38.603 --> 06:40.669
You aware your, uh... your
taillight's busted, sir?

06:40.746 --> 06:42.889
Yes. That just happened.
I'm really sorry.

06:42.966 --> 06:45.547
Sure it did. License and
registration, please, ma'am.

06:45.995 --> 06:47.149
Uh,
I'm sorry, Officer.

06:47.226 --> 06:48.823
I left my
license at home.

06:50.277 --> 06:51.389
You're driving
without a license?

06:51.457 --> 06:52.698
Well, I just walked down

06:52.775 --> 06:53.967
to pick up my husband
at the beach.

06:54.044 --> 06:55.580
Yeah, it's my fault.
I was on a call.

06:55.657 --> 06:56.531
I asked her to drive.

06:56.599 --> 06:58.472
- My mistake.
- Yeah.

07:01.545 --> 07:03.006
Why don't you step out
of the car, ma'am.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.532
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

07:04.609 --> 07:05.894
- What?
- You, too, sir.

07:20.157 --> 07:21.698
Hey, is Peter Brand
still on the force?

07:21.775 --> 07:22.740
He's an old friend of mine.

07:22.817 --> 07:23.975
He knows us both really well.

07:24.052 --> 07:25.698
I have no idea who that is.

07:26.243 --> 07:27.932
Uh, look, this is my car.

07:28.009 --> 07:29.135
The taillight's
my responsibility.

07:29.212 --> 07:30.209
I'll get it fixed immediately.

07:30.286 --> 07:31.382
Do you have a license, ma'am?

07:31.459 --> 07:32.502
Of course she
has a license.

07:32.579 --> 07:33.622
I'm asking her.

07:34.939 --> 07:36.313
Yes, I do.

07:36.638 --> 07:38.123
Why don't you just
write me a ticket and do

07:38.200 --> 07:39.839
whatever it is
you gotta do...

07:40.758 --> 07:42.003
What's your name?

07:42.478 --> 07:43.638
You said you live
locally, right?

07:43.715 --> 07:44.811
Just tell me
your name,

07:44.888 --> 07:45.928
I'll radio it in,

07:46.005 --> 07:48.495
we'll look up your
license number from our files.

07:49.193 --> 07:50.769
Luisa Lockhart.

07:51.201 --> 07:52.118
Thank you, Ms. Lockhart.

07:52.195 --> 07:53.480
Please wait right here.

07:57.207 --> 07:58.283
Hey.

07:59.283 --> 08:01.130
Hey, we're gonna be fine.

08:01.207 --> 08:02.620
It's okay. We're married.

08:02.722 --> 08:05.003
No, it doesn't matter, Cole.
They don't care.

08:24.332 --> 08:25.753
Listen, I gotta answer
a call on the other

08:25.821 --> 08:27.187
side of town,
so I'm gonna let you go,

08:27.255 --> 08:28.898
but next time
I see you driving, Ms. Lockhart,

08:28.975 --> 08:30.464
you better have
your license on you.

08:30.970 --> 08:32.833
Of course she will.
Thank you, Officer.

08:32.910 --> 08:34.659
Sorry for the inconvenience.

08:40.615 --> 08:41.806
Hey.

08:43.683 --> 08:44.868
Here.

09:43.506 --> 09:45.119
Hey. I was looking
everywhere for this.

09:45.196 --> 09:46.206
Where'd you find it?

09:46.283 --> 09:48.094
Uh, behind
the washing machine.

09:56.690 --> 09:58.065
You okay?

09:58.352 --> 09:59.904
Yeah, yeah.

10:15.204 --> 10:18.839
Mr. and Mrs. Lockhart,
it's so nice to see you again.

10:23.405 --> 10:25.568
I-I've been
practicing so much.

10:25.672 --> 10:27.141
I'll leave you
to it, then.

10:27.218 --> 10:28.469
Maybe a round
of coffee?

10:28.546 --> 10:30.746
Oh, that would be wonderful.
Thank you. - Welcome.

10:30.884 --> 10:32.823
- Please.
- Thank you.

10:34.886 --> 10:36.628
Your wife is quite an asset.

10:36.705 --> 10:38.308
Yes, she is.
Thank you.

10:38.594 --> 10:40.925
Will Ms. Bailey
be joining us today?

10:41.712 --> 10:44.060
Of course. I just think
she's running a little bit late.

10:44.137 --> 10:45.375
Oh. Should we wait?

10:45.452 --> 10:47.818
No, it's fine.
We can... we can catch her up.

10:47.895 --> 10:49.769
Okay. Wonderful.

10:49.924 --> 10:51.477
So, Mr. Lockhart,

10:51.554 --> 10:53.291
we appreciate you
even taking this meeting,

10:53.368 --> 10:54.887
because we know you
haven't historically

10:54.964 --> 10:57.423
been open to the concept
of franchising.

10:57.836 --> 10:59.952
We hope to prove
to you today that,

11:00.029 --> 11:03.963
with the right approach,
this expansion strategy

11:04.128 --> 11:07.831
will provide you and your
lovely wife limitless revenues

11:07.908 --> 11:09.282
while preserving
the integrity

11:09.359 --> 11:11.808
of the institution
you worked so hard to build.

11:13.574 --> 11:14.769
That sounds great.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.193
Are you sure
you don't want us

11:16.270 --> 11:17.511
to wait for Ms. Bailey,
Mr. Lockhart?

11:17.588 --> 11:18.631
No, it's fine.

11:18.805 --> 11:20.274
Do you want me to call her?

11:26.645 --> 11:28.438
- Sir?
- Thank you.

11:30.174 --> 11:31.327
Thank you.

11:31.553 --> 11:34.118
So, let's begin.

11:36.870 --> 11:38.278
I think we
have effectively

11:38.355 --> 11:39.955
shown you where
in the marketplace

11:40.032 --> 11:41.929
we feel there's
consumer demand

11:42.006 --> 11:43.284
for a restaurant
that feels

11:43.361 --> 11:45.237
authentically
Eastern Seaboard.

11:45.548 --> 11:47.513
Now we have come up
with some visuals

11:47.590 --> 11:49.439
that just slightly
tweak the signage.

11:49.516 --> 11:50.645
Hi.

11:52.673 --> 11:53.842
Sorry I'm late.

11:53.919 --> 11:55.007
Hey.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.513
Hi. I'm Alison.

11:56.590 --> 11:57.925
Hi. So glad
you could make it.

11:58.002 --> 11:59.967
Nice to meet you.
So, what'd I miss?

12:00.044 --> 12:02.212
You're perfectly
timed, Ms. Bailey.

12:02.654 --> 12:05.024
I was just about
to show Mr. Lockhart

12:05.404 --> 12:07.600
our new branding concept.

12:11.975 --> 12:13.814
Wow. Wow.

12:13.991 --> 12:15.453
That's, um...

12:16.437 --> 12:18.180
That... Yeah.

12:19.215 --> 12:20.878
Are you mad at me
because I was late?

12:20.955 --> 12:22.312
Forty-five minutes late.

12:22.389 --> 12:23.952
I said sorry.
I was studying,

12:24.029 --> 12:25.346
and I just... lost
track of time.

12:25.423 --> 12:27.466
Do you have any idea what
a bad impression that makes?

12:27.543 --> 12:29.151
This restaurant group is huge.

12:29.228 --> 12:31.318
They own
Outback Steakhouse, IHOP,

12:31.395 --> 12:33.461
- Five Guys...
- Wow. IHOP.

12:34.561 --> 12:37.304
They did $6 billion dollars
in revenue

12:37.381 --> 12:38.279
last quarter alone.

12:38.356 --> 12:40.066
- Yeah, that's a lot of money.
- And I'm trying to make a

12:40.143 --> 12:41.909
good impression so that they'll
make a competitive offer,

12:41.986 --> 12:44.294
and you show up
looking like a fucking coed.

12:44.371 --> 12:46.278
Don't they have to make us
a competitive offer

12:46.355 --> 12:48.201
since we're not actually
interested in selling?

12:48.278 --> 12:50.714
Ali, if you want to be
a part of this process,

12:50.791 --> 12:54.344
will you please just try to take
it a little more seriously?

12:54.608 --> 12:55.785
Show up on time.

12:55.862 --> 12:56.919
Dry your hair.

12:56.996 --> 12:58.650
Give them the respect
that they deserve.

12:58.727 --> 12:59.922
Dry my hair?

13:01.220 --> 13:03.575
Since when do you care so much
what city people think?

13:03.652 --> 13:05.539
We're not in
high school anymore.

13:05.616 --> 13:08.086
I wear a tie
to a business meeting.

13:08.367 --> 13:10.150
I try not to waste
people's time.

13:10.227 --> 13:12.021
It's called adulthood.
Join me here, why don't you?

13:12.098 --> 13:13.575
Okay, I'm sorry.

13:13.652 --> 13:16.774
I've let you down
once again, Cole.

13:18.155 --> 13:19.411
I'm gonna go now.

13:19.488 --> 13:21.404
They want to take us
to dinner tonight.

13:21.481 --> 13:23.427
7:30, Turf
in East Hampton.

13:23.504 --> 13:24.590
Fancy.

13:24.673 --> 13:25.888
You think you can make it?

13:25.965 --> 13:28.188
Will your busy schedule
allow for it?

13:28.444 --> 13:30.129
I'll be there.

13:31.123 --> 13:32.907
Wear a dress.

13:48.045 --> 13:49.138
Wow.

13:49.230 --> 13:50.643
Ready to go?

13:51.092 --> 13:52.271
Uh, yeah.

13:52.348 --> 13:53.339
I mean, no.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.016
I gotta change,
but yeah.

13:56.097 --> 13:58.177
How much did they offer?

13:58.975 --> 14:01.539
Two-point-one against 90%
of the company.

14:01.897 --> 14:03.263
Plus a small portion

14:03.340 --> 14:05.641
of the future franchise
royalty fees.

14:05.967 --> 14:08.000
Well, that seems
like a lot, right?

14:08.077 --> 14:11.052
Actually, no, it's not.
Not for this model.

14:11.129 --> 14:13.091
But because they're picking up
all of the other costs...

14:13.168 --> 14:16.670
The... construction, design,
development, everything...

14:16.874 --> 14:18.798
They want a bigger piece
of the profits.

14:19.030 --> 14:21.258
Still, you'll own ten percent
of the company.

14:21.335 --> 14:22.857
Plus, won't you
be getting part

14:22.934 --> 14:25.253
of the annual revenue
of all franchised restaurants,

14:25.330 --> 14:27.980
plus whatever this royalty fee
turns out to be?

14:28.057 --> 14:29.112
Yeah, it adds up.

14:29.189 --> 14:32.282
And 2.1 million isn't
anything to sneeze at.

14:32.378 --> 14:34.641
I mean, that alone
would make you pretty rich.

14:35.975 --> 14:38.429
Us. It would make us
pretty rich.

14:38.506 --> 14:40.860
You could buy back
your family's ranch.

14:41.889 --> 14:43.649
Yeah, maybe.

14:44.061 --> 14:46.711
So, why do you seem
depressed?

14:46.788 --> 14:50.774
Because I bought
the Lobster Roll to save it.

14:51.248 --> 14:53.956
I mean, Oscar was gonna turn it
into a fucking bowling alley.

14:54.033 --> 14:56.586
If I sell it now,
what was the point?

15:03.834 --> 15:05.719
I don't know what I'm doing.

16:16.191 --> 16:17.441
Sir?

16:18.149 --> 16:19.441
Oh.

16:22.980 --> 16:24.383
That's great.

16:24.460 --> 16:25.632
Thank you.

16:26.937 --> 16:28.112
Would you all
like to order,

16:28.189 --> 16:30.677
or are you still waiting on
the last member of your party?

16:32.539 --> 16:34.466
We could wait
a little longer.

16:34.816 --> 16:37.349
No. She must be held up
somewhere, so...

16:37.498 --> 16:38.911
we should go ahead
and order.

16:39.298 --> 16:41.429
I'll take the rib eye,
well done.

16:41.506 --> 16:42.848
Excellent choice, sir.

16:42.925 --> 16:43.932
And for you, ma'am?

16:44.009 --> 16:45.888
A butternut squash
torte, please.

16:46.300 --> 16:47.312
It's the chef's
special tonight.

16:47.389 --> 16:48.891
You'll love that. Ma'am?

16:49.862 --> 16:52.028
Um, I think...

16:52.105 --> 16:53.979
I'm gonna have
the halibut.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.862
And would you like
that served with the baby kale?

16:55.939 --> 16:57.141
Uh, yeah,
that would be wonderful.

16:57.218 --> 16:58.296
- Thank you.
- Excellent.

16:58.373 --> 16:59.833
Sir, what can I get for you?

17:00.049 --> 17:01.497
Think I'll have the...

17:01.730 --> 17:02.758
Say it for me.

17:02.835 --> 17:04.271
Oh, paella.

17:04.518 --> 17:05.560
Paella.

17:05.652 --> 17:07.055
- Paella.
- Paella.

17:07.132 --> 17:08.144
Yes.

17:08.272 --> 17:10.075
I just love
how she says it.

17:11.964 --> 17:13.144
It's an
excellent choice, sir.

17:13.221 --> 17:14.810
We make that
with wild farro here.

17:14.887 --> 17:16.294
And what can I
get for you?

17:16.371 --> 17:19.130
I'll have the blackened,
uh, prawn pasta.

17:20.942 --> 17:22.397
Oh, terrific.

17:22.502 --> 17:24.143
So, what do you
think about Miami?

17:24.220 --> 17:26.528
I would love to go
to Miami. I've never been.

17:26.605 --> 17:28.143
We would love to have
you there

17:28.220 --> 17:30.323
- as soon as possible.
- You have excellent taste, sir.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.101
Of course,
we'd ask your husband first.

17:32.178 --> 17:34.044
We wouldn't just
steal you from him.

17:34.911 --> 17:36.776
What's that?
You're gonna steal my wife?

17:36.853 --> 17:38.847
No. Mrs. Lockhart
was telling me

17:38.924 --> 17:41.013
she got her degree
in hospitality.

17:41.292 --> 17:44.263
We have a new property
about to open in Miami,

17:44.340 --> 17:47.354
and it's practically begging
for someone like Luisa

17:47.431 --> 17:48.840
at the front
of the house.

17:48.917 --> 17:50.693
So, what do you say,
Mr. Lockhart?

17:50.917 --> 17:52.925
We franchise
the Lobster Roll,

17:53.002 --> 17:54.408
make you a rich man,

17:54.485 --> 17:57.591
and then set you up in
a penthouse on Miami Beach.

18:02.011 --> 18:03.552
We're going to Miami.

18:04.172 --> 18:05.958
That's the spirit.

18:07.441 --> 18:09.795
We'll talk about it
when we get home.

18:24.456 --> 18:25.573
Cole.

18:28.058 --> 18:29.409
We should have a toast.

18:29.486 --> 18:31.044
- Sure.
- Yeah.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.300
Cheers.

18:40.831 --> 18:42.414
Luisa.

18:42.632 --> 18:45.125
Look, next time you want
to go on a dinner date

18:45.202 --> 18:47.447
with your ex-wife,
just leave me out of it.

18:47.524 --> 18:49.477
Oh, for fuck's sake,
she's my business partner.

18:49.554 --> 18:51.404
Yeah, I know.
Lucky her.

19:01.847 --> 19:03.291
I'm sorry.

19:05.019 --> 19:07.427
I was not looking for Alison.

19:07.925 --> 19:09.713
You know how places
like that make me feel.

19:09.790 --> 19:11.505
They make my skin crawl.

19:11.582 --> 19:12.469
I just wanted
to get out of there.

19:12.546 --> 19:14.661
And I hate wearing
these clothes.

19:17.019 --> 19:19.622
Thank you for being
so wonderful.

19:19.904 --> 19:22.044
And thank you
for learning Mandarin.

19:23.266 --> 19:25.404
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

19:28.024 --> 19:31.169
Look, this is a huge decision.

19:31.262 --> 19:33.031
Do I not get to have
a hard time with it?

19:33.108 --> 19:34.661
No, you don't.

19:35.414 --> 19:37.607
What exactly
is the problem here?

19:38.039 --> 19:40.488
They're offering to make you
an incredibly rich man,

19:40.565 --> 19:42.013
and you don't have
to do anything.

19:42.090 --> 19:43.898
Us. They're offering us.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.182
Why do you keep
talking about this

19:45.259 --> 19:46.727
as though it has nothing
to do with you?

19:46.804 --> 19:48.396
You want to know
what I hate?

19:48.631 --> 19:51.208
I hate that I can't take
that job in Miami.

19:51.311 --> 19:53.529
That I can't take
any interesting job.

19:53.714 --> 19:56.367
That I can't put my degree
to use in this fucking country.

19:56.444 --> 19:58.346
That I'm totally
fucking dependent on you.

19:58.423 --> 19:59.135
Stop.

19:59.212 --> 20:01.271
I hate that I have to use
your credit card.

20:01.369 --> 20:02.906
That you sign all our checks.

20:02.983 --> 20:04.336
And it's going
to be like that

20:04.413 --> 20:06.169
for the rest
of my life.

20:06.300 --> 20:08.703
I hate that a fucking cop
can pull me over

20:08.780 --> 20:11.666
and my only hope
is that you know him

20:11.743 --> 20:14.041
and he likes you
so he won't fuck with me.

20:14.118 --> 20:15.203
Listen, what happened
this morning...

20:15.280 --> 20:16.782
What if you decide
to leave me?

20:16.875 --> 20:18.715
I am not going to leave you.

20:20.293 --> 20:21.942
Well, clearly not today.

20:22.019 --> 20:23.687
Alison is busy.

20:24.292 --> 20:25.658
Fuck you.

20:49.256 --> 20:52.117
Maybe we can try again
to get you a green card.

20:53.459 --> 20:55.899
We've been over this
again and again.

20:56.100 --> 20:58.472
You know, I-I would have to
leave the country for ten years.

20:58.549 --> 20:59.749
So we'll file for a waiver.

20:59.826 --> 21:00.842
How?

21:01.466 --> 21:02.945
I'm not a student.

21:03.350 --> 21:05.281
They don't care
that we're married.

21:06.081 --> 21:07.781
I came illegally.

21:09.807 --> 21:11.867
I have no special skills.

21:12.599 --> 21:14.453
I have no children of my own.

21:15.458 --> 21:17.555
I can't demonstrate hardship.

21:19.975 --> 21:22.180
Nobody would care
if I leave tomorrow.

21:22.636 --> 21:23.983
I would.

21:27.058 --> 21:30.554
And then I have to sit at dinner
like a fucking escort

21:31.311 --> 21:34.005
and listen as they throw
opportunities at you.

21:34.082 --> 21:35.456
And you're depressed
because you don't want

21:35.533 --> 21:36.847
to wear a fucking tie!

21:36.924 --> 21:38.053
Enough.

21:38.147 --> 21:39.487
I'm going for a walk.

21:39.564 --> 21:40.787
Good.

22:32.320 --> 22:33.571
Do I know you?

22:35.110 --> 22:36.829
Yeah, I think you decked me

22:36.906 --> 22:39.252
with your board this morning
and then called me "Grandpa."

22:39.329 --> 22:40.844
Ah...

22:41.786 --> 22:43.087
That's right.

22:43.274 --> 22:44.308
Yeah.

22:45.300 --> 22:47.130
Sorry about that, bro.

22:47.266 --> 22:49.455
Yo, let me make it up to you.

22:49.831 --> 22:51.072
You want a beer?

22:51.149 --> 22:52.463
That's all right. I'm good.

22:52.610 --> 22:54.732
Yo, isn't that the dude
with the rad board?

22:55.539 --> 22:56.852
Yep.

22:58.006 --> 22:59.778
Where'd you get that board, man?

22:59.855 --> 23:01.109
My board?

23:01.766 --> 23:03.455
The one you
were riding today.

23:03.625 --> 23:05.424
It's vintage, right?

23:05.891 --> 23:07.606
Yeah, I guess. It was my dad's.

23:07.683 --> 23:08.645
Looked like
it had a couple

23:08.722 --> 23:09.916
of redwood stringers.

23:09.993 --> 23:11.830
It's really fucking rare, man.

23:11.972 --> 23:13.440
You don't know who made it?

23:13.774 --> 23:14.774
Nope.

23:15.742 --> 23:16.797
Sit.

23:17.086 --> 23:18.997
We don't bite.

23:20.555 --> 23:24.533
The swallow tail looked like
it was from the late '70s.

23:25.493 --> 23:26.936
Redwood's probably

23:27.013 --> 23:28.677
Northern Californian.

23:31.100 --> 23:33.372
Once saw a redwood pattern
like that

23:33.449 --> 23:35.502
from a shaper
in Half Moon Bay.

23:35.655 --> 23:36.985
Where's Half Moon Bay?

23:37.936 --> 23:39.658
California.

23:39.979 --> 23:42.104
Bram, you're
such a surf nerd.

23:42.586 --> 23:44.971
I'd kill for
a board like that.

23:47.374 --> 23:49.579
Of course, the boards

23:49.800 --> 23:52.421
Duke Kahanamoku surfed
were made of

23:52.558 --> 23:54.576
vertical-grain
Hawaiian redwood

23:54.653 --> 23:56.527
back in, like, 1910.

24:01.820 --> 24:03.745
It's okay.
You finish it.

26:27.495 --> 26:29.189
What the fuck happened to you?

26:29.266 --> 26:30.786
It's a long story.

26:31.737 --> 26:33.734
I was taking a walk,
I bumped into these kids

26:33.811 --> 26:34.674
at a bonfire...

26:34.751 --> 26:36.232
And they drew on your face?

26:38.192 --> 26:39.598
They did what?

26:47.081 --> 26:49.685
Motherfucker.

26:58.011 --> 27:00.036
Motherfucker!

27:06.073 --> 27:07.669
What are you doing?

27:07.909 --> 27:10.648
You can't shoot someone just
because they drew on your face.

27:10.725 --> 27:11.934
Sure I can.

27:12.352 --> 27:13.515
Give me the
fucking gun.

27:13.592 --> 27:14.640
Stay out of it!

27:14.717 --> 27:16.760
Give me the fucking gun.

27:41.850 --> 27:42.896
Hello?

27:43.591 --> 27:44.676
Hey, Alison.

27:44.753 --> 27:46.588
Uh, of course
you can talk to him.

27:46.665 --> 27:47.875
He's right here.

27:49.349 --> 27:50.599
Hmm?

28:01.198 --> 28:02.370
Hello?

28:04.156 --> 28:05.544
What's the problem?

28:12.949 --> 28:13.990
Yeah.

28:14.135 --> 28:15.515
Yes, I can be right there.

28:15.592 --> 28:16.692
Don't worry.

28:17.042 --> 28:18.167
Bye.

28:36.404 --> 28:38.655
Oh, my God,
what happened to your face?

28:38.784 --> 28:39.729
It's a long story.

28:39.806 --> 28:40.643
Hey, kiddo.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.121
Hi, Dad. You look scary.

28:42.198 --> 28:44.257
I know I do.
Sorry, baby.

28:44.443 --> 28:45.731
It won't start?

28:45.821 --> 28:46.935
No.

28:47.216 --> 28:48.755
I think it's the battery.

28:53.936 --> 28:55.937
Yep, I think you're right.

28:57.308 --> 28:59.007
How was last night?

29:00.791 --> 29:02.116
I'm sorry I missed it.

29:02.193 --> 29:03.838
I was so stressed out
about this test,

29:03.915 --> 29:05.765
I just completely forgot.

29:06.392 --> 29:07.392
Really?

29:08.083 --> 29:11.244
So your babysitter came,
rang your front doorbell,

29:11.321 --> 29:13.405
and you just didn't hear her?

29:16.474 --> 29:19.180
You never had any intention
of coming, did you?

29:19.583 --> 29:20.890
You're gonna do
what you want to do

29:20.967 --> 29:22.371
in this situation, Cole.

29:22.448 --> 29:23.667
I don't think you actually care

29:23.744 --> 29:25.094
about my opinion,
so what does it matter

29:25.171 --> 29:27.299
- if I'm there or not?
- Of course I care about your opinion.

29:27.376 --> 29:28.283
You're a partner.

29:28.360 --> 29:29.309
Yeah, okay, okay.

29:29.386 --> 29:30.796
Well, I wouldn't sell it.

29:32.948 --> 29:34.608
We're different people.

29:37.920 --> 29:39.319
Pop the hood.

29:47.717 --> 29:48.898
What about the money?

29:48.975 --> 29:50.054
I have money.

29:50.131 --> 29:51.135
Not this kind of money.

29:51.212 --> 29:52.796
Well, how much do I need?

29:54.114 --> 29:56.037
You want to know
what I really think?

29:56.114 --> 29:57.814
- Always.
- Okay, I think you want me

29:57.891 --> 29:59.382
to tell you not
to sell it.

29:59.633 --> 30:00.885
So you can turn around,
sell it,

30:00.962 --> 30:03.062
and look like a hero to Luisa.

30:05.497 --> 30:07.319
Get in the car and start it.

30:12.193 --> 30:13.458
All right.

30:14.639 --> 30:16.780
Ah, thank you.

30:23.466 --> 30:24.590
All right, kiddo.

30:24.667 --> 30:26.038
Let's get you to school.

30:30.599 --> 30:32.718
- Watch your head.
- Okay.

30:32.881 --> 30:34.866
- Buckle up.
- Here.

30:35.591 --> 30:37.922
Don't turn the car off
when you get to the school.

30:38.028 --> 30:39.444
Got it, Coach.

30:42.304 --> 30:43.388
Oh.

30:44.068 --> 30:45.274
Did it ever occur to you

30:45.351 --> 30:47.452
that I don't want
to sell the Lobster Roll?

30:48.761 --> 30:50.991
That I don't want to become part
of the establishment?

30:51.360 --> 30:53.100
Cole, you drive a Jeep.

30:53.177 --> 30:54.939
You built a mansion
on the water.

30:55.016 --> 30:56.733
You tip like a fucking banker.

30:57.277 --> 30:59.124
You are the establishment.

I'm just calling
to say I'm sorry

31:13.050 --> 31:15.575
about this morning
and about last night.

31:15.682 --> 31:17.166
I was wondering
if I could take you

31:17.243 --> 31:18.828
out to dinner tonight
and just...

31:19.310 --> 31:21.116
we could talk about everything.

31:29.215 --> 31:31.655
Motherfucker.

31:35.016 --> 31:36.308

- What did you put in my drink?

32:04.969 --> 32:06.679
I don't know what
you're talking about.

32:06.860 --> 32:08.976
Ah, you're gonna
break my arm off!

32:09.053 --> 32:12.128
Do you have any idea
who I am in this community?

32:12.205 --> 32:13.739
You can't prove anything.

32:13.816 --> 32:16.137
I just watched you
freebasing, asshole.

32:16.214 --> 32:17.541
What are you gonna
do about it?

32:17.618 --> 32:19.658
I'm gonna call the cops.
That's what I'm gonna do.

32:20.065 --> 32:22.161
That's a great idea,
Mr. Lockhart.

32:22.289 --> 32:24.080
Why don't you give
the police a call, huh?

32:24.157 --> 32:26.570
Love to tell them who sold me
my first eight-ball,

32:26.647 --> 32:28.446
Mr. Lockhart.

32:28.523 --> 32:31.395
So you can act like you're
the mayor of Montauk, Cole,

32:31.539 --> 32:34.419
but I was 15 when your brother
got me high for the first time.

32:34.524 --> 32:37.729
So spare me the sanctimony,
you fucking hypocrite.

Oh, hey.

32:56.433 --> 32:57.777
Come in.

33:08.014 --> 33:09.638
Did he just do this?

33:10.433 --> 33:12.747
When you were meeting
with Dr. Lippman?

33:15.204 --> 33:16.934
How did that go?

33:21.975 --> 33:23.544
It takes time.

33:23.936 --> 33:26.786
I know. It's hard
to believe at this moment.

33:26.948 --> 33:30.236
Just promise me you'll keep
coming to see us here.

33:40.009 --> 33:42.575
He says that that's
his father.

33:44.463 --> 33:46.050
It's Tony.

33:49.017 --> 33:50.864
That's what he told you?

33:53.392 --> 33:54.768
Where is Jamie
right now?

33:54.845 --> 33:57.036
He's playing in the kids' room.

33:57.558 --> 34:00.919
I don't know. I just wanted to
show that to you before we left.

34:05.555 --> 34:07.083
How are things at home?

34:10.654 --> 34:11.925
Not good.

34:13.165 --> 34:14.995
Did you tell Dr. Lippman that?

34:18.581 --> 34:20.232
Why not, Abby?

34:27.728 --> 34:29.264
Hey, why do you think that...

34:29.355 --> 34:31.896
Jamie drew a picture
like this of Tony?

34:32.737 --> 34:34.058
Uh...

34:34.232 --> 34:36.312
ever since Evie's funeral...

34:39.678 --> 34:40.893
He drinks.

34:42.730 --> 34:44.310
All the time.

34:46.308 --> 34:48.371
And he blacks out most nights.

34:48.545 --> 34:50.411
And I can't wake him.

34:53.079 --> 34:57.247
He snapped at the neighbor
for asking him to move his car.

34:57.932 --> 34:59.088
He...

34:59.187 --> 35:01.392
called him terrible names.

35:02.312 --> 35:04.225
Racist, awful.

35:06.063 --> 35:09.122
I mean, I-I had to beg the guy
not to call the police.

35:13.232 --> 35:15.130
Are you afraid of him?

35:19.902 --> 35:20.939
All right.

35:21.016 --> 35:23.536
And you didn't tell
Dr. Lippman any of this?

35:26.479 --> 35:28.892
How can she help you
if she doesn't know?

35:31.284 --> 35:34.435
I mean, how can she
help me if she does?

35:39.168 --> 35:41.486
She needs to be able
to assess if it's safe

35:41.563 --> 35:43.344
for you and Jamie
to keep living with Tony.

35:43.421 --> 35:44.801
No. No.

35:45.060 --> 35:47.349
Tony would never hurt Jamie.

35:47.495 --> 35:49.263
Would he hurt you?

35:53.050 --> 35:54.225
Look...

35:54.691 --> 35:56.804
Abby, listen, um...

35:57.472 --> 36:00.786
when couples experience, uh,
the death of a child...

36:01.350 --> 36:03.838
sometimes they need
some time apart.

36:03.915 --> 36:05.440
No, it doesn't mean
it's forever.

36:05.517 --> 36:08.500
But if he's out of control
and you're afraid of him,

36:08.577 --> 36:10.724
why not go stay
someplace else?

36:11.644 --> 36:12.682
Your mom's?

36:12.759 --> 36:14.997
No. Jamie needs his dad.

36:15.542 --> 36:17.055
He can't...

36:18.941 --> 36:22.036
He-he cannot lose
another person in his life.

36:22.113 --> 36:23.453
- He's too young.
- Abby, listen to me.

36:23.530 --> 36:26.357
The only thing Jamie needs
right now is for you to be safe.

36:29.471 --> 36:30.738
Mom.

36:30.863 --> 36:31.939
I'm tired.

36:32.016 --> 36:33.328
- Can we go?
- Oh, yeah, sweetheart.

36:33.405 --> 36:35.115
We're gonna go
right now.

36:36.474 --> 36:37.641
Okay.

36:48.115 --> 36:50.444
I'm really glad
you're here, Alison.

36:51.989 --> 36:53.919
The therapists are fine, but...

36:54.206 --> 36:58.075
it's just so nice to talk
to somebody else who's...

37:00.738 --> 37:02.280
I'm here.

37:11.474 --> 37:13.215
Are those your kids?

37:13.432 --> 37:14.508
Uh...

37:14.585 --> 37:15.611
Yeah.

37:15.688 --> 37:16.887
These two.

37:16.964 --> 37:18.356
- Oh.
- Yeah.

37:21.823 --> 37:23.585
Which one's...?

37:25.858 --> 37:27.245
This guy.

37:43.669 --> 37:46.072
Hey. You ready?

37:47.267 --> 37:49.219
One, two, three.

38:01.483 --> 38:04.219
Is, uh... is this the
grant coordinator's office?

38:05.146 --> 38:07.242
Um... uh, no.

38:07.535 --> 38:08.823
Are you sure?

38:10.053 --> 38:11.270
Yeah.

38:11.347 --> 38:13.516
This is peer-to-peer counseling.

38:13.756 --> 38:15.844
Oh. Well, then, uh...

38:15.936 --> 38:17.703
then I'm fucking lost.

38:17.850 --> 38:20.024
Uh, well, who are you
looking for?

38:20.475 --> 38:21.992
Meyers.
Roger Meyers.

38:22.069 --> 38:23.914
Uh, yeah, he's one floor up.

38:23.998 --> 38:26.278
Oh. Um, okay.

38:26.355 --> 38:28.106
And the elevators are...?

38:28.183 --> 38:29.253
Uh, down the hall.

38:29.330 --> 38:30.977
First left, then a right,

38:31.068 --> 38:32.273
then your second left.

38:32.350 --> 38:34.821
Okay, down the hall,
first, um...?

38:34.933 --> 38:36.216
I'm sorry, I...

38:36.293 --> 38:38.013
No, it's a maze.

38:38.209 --> 38:40.395
- Uh, I'll show you.
- Oh, that's okay. You don't have to...

38:40.472 --> 38:43.203
No, it's okay. I need to go
check my mail anyway, so...

38:45.550 --> 38:48.136
Uh, hi. I'm Alison.

38:48.213 --> 38:50.009
Oh. Ben.

38:51.238 --> 38:53.234
- Uh... yeah.
- After you.

39:04.615 --> 39:06.361
So, you work here?

39:06.622 --> 39:08.630
Um, uh, yeah.
That was my...

39:08.707 --> 39:10.328
- Your office.
- Mm-hmm.

39:10.617 --> 39:12.352
Right. Right.

39:13.897 --> 39:15.563
Yeah.

39:24.058 --> 39:25.267
Oh.

39:26.102 --> 39:27.382
- Oh. Hey.
- Alison.

39:27.459 --> 39:28.966
I was just coming
down to see you.

39:29.043 --> 39:30.462
That conference I was
telling you about...

39:30.539 --> 39:31.638
- Uh-huh?
- EMDR.

39:31.715 --> 39:33.005
It's happening
in Montauk.

39:33.082 --> 39:34.241
- It is?
- Yes.

39:34.318 --> 39:36.026
A place called
Gooney's, I think.

39:36.103 --> 39:37.466
- Gurney's.
- That's it.

39:37.543 --> 39:39.805
Week after next.
I'll get you the details.

39:39.882 --> 39:41.317
Okay, thank you.

39:42.792 --> 39:44.461
- Still coming?
- Oh.

39:44.702 --> 39:46.240
Yeah.

39:56.641 --> 39:58.264
Mmm...

40:01.376 --> 40:03.233
Ah. Here.

40:03.330 --> 40:04.862
Ah, yeah.

40:04.939 --> 40:07.854
It's very obvious
when you know what

40:07.931 --> 40:09.088
you're looking for,
isn't it?

40:09.165 --> 40:10.553
Mmm.

40:11.263 --> 40:12.832
Well, thank you.

40:13.079 --> 40:14.559
I couldn't have
done it without you.

40:30.529 --> 40:32.958
No, I-I am sorry.
It just slipped my mind.

40:33.035 --> 40:34.516
<i>It slipped your mi...</i>

40:34.733 --> 40:35.796
No, I'm not.

40:35.873 --> 40:36.801
I'm listening to you.

40:36.878 --> 40:38.762
<i>I can hear you typing.
Would you just stop for</i>

40:38.839 --> 40:40.239
- a second and pay attention?
- No...

40:40.316 --> 40:42.052
I'm not doing anything else.
I swear.

40:42.129 --> 40:43.143
I'm just listening.

40:43.220 --> 40:45.981
Do you have any idea
how embarrassing it is

40:46.058 --> 40:47.130
for your own
business partner...

40:47.207 --> 40:48.658
I just wanted
to leave this with you.

40:48.735 --> 40:50.700
Oh. Did you get a chance
to finish my recommendation?

40:50.777 --> 40:52.502
Yes. It's in your inbox.

40:52.623 --> 40:54.411
Cole, I said I'm sorry.

40:54.578 --> 40:56.275
It wasn't intentional.

40:56.420 --> 40:59.231
No, look, I've just been
really busy at work, and...

40:59.308 --> 41:01.442
<i>Really, your absence
was completely disrespectful.</i>

41:01.519 --> 41:03.932
I'm not trying
to disrespect anybody.

41:06.225 --> 41:07.939
Uh, Cole, I...

41:08.016 --> 41:09.565
I have to go.

41:11.391 --> 41:13.436
I apologize, okay?
I'm sorry.

41:13.513 --> 41:14.666
What I did was wrong.

41:14.743 --> 41:15.757
<i>Yeah, you think?</i>

41:15.834 --> 41:17.736
Okay?
Anything else?

41:17.813 --> 41:20.096
<i>Yeah, show up next time.</i>

41:24.425 --> 41:25.650
Tough call?

41:25.877 --> 41:28.408
No, it's fine.

41:29.433 --> 41:30.900
Did you get your grant?

41:31.453 --> 41:32.454
My what?

41:32.531 --> 41:33.888
What, you're not
applying for...

41:33.965 --> 41:34.726
Oh, no, no, no.

41:34.803 --> 41:36.101
I, uh...

41:36.178 --> 41:38.175
No, uh, actually,
you need me.

41:38.372 --> 41:39.446
What?

41:39.523 --> 41:40.890
I'm from the VHA.

41:40.967 --> 41:43.174
Uh, you guys applied
to us for a grant.

41:43.414 --> 41:45.142
I just came to check out
the facilities,

41:45.219 --> 41:46.515
make sure everything's kosher.

41:46.592 --> 41:48.666
Oh. You work with veterans?

41:48.743 --> 41:51.489
I do. You seem really
excited about that.

41:51.609 --> 41:55.122
Oh, no, I'm just applying for a
clinical rotation with the V.A.

41:55.199 --> 41:57.554
Really? Are you a therapist?

41:57.631 --> 42:00.932
No, not yet, but I'm
studying to become one.

42:01.195 --> 42:02.278
Oh, hey.

42:02.355 --> 42:03.554
Can I help you?

42:03.631 --> 42:05.236
I'm looking
for a Ms. Bailey.

42:05.393 --> 42:06.799
Yeah, that's me.

42:06.964 --> 42:09.788
They sent me to sign up
for some program

42:09.865 --> 42:12.073
where parents talk
to other parents.

42:12.150 --> 42:13.832
Yeah. Come in.

42:13.909 --> 42:16.531
Um, please just
take a seat, and...

42:16.698 --> 42:18.518
Uh, would you mind?

42:18.629 --> 42:20.497
Oh, no. Um...

42:21.167 --> 42:23.163
It was good to meet you.
And thanks for your help.

42:23.240 --> 42:24.620
You, too.

42:28.306 --> 42:31.972
Uh, we just have some paperwork
to go through, so...

42:32.998 --> 42:35.109
Oh, no, I'd prefer
if you didn't lock the door.

42:35.186 --> 42:36.715
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

42:38.899 --> 42:40.812
My wife told me
what you said to her.

42:41.558 --> 42:42.737
Your wife?

42:42.845 --> 42:44.636
Do you have any fucking idea

42:44.713 --> 42:46.366
what our life
is like right now?

42:46.443 --> 42:48.129
What we're going through?

42:49.378 --> 42:50.864
She doesn't sleep.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.796
She wanders the house at night

42:52.873 --> 42:54.567
banging her head
against windows.

42:54.644 --> 42:56.566
She's not taking care
of our son.

42:56.643 --> 42:57.980
There's no food in the house.

42:58.057 --> 43:00.718
I found him last night trying
to eat dry pasta for dinner.

43:00.795 --> 43:01.767
Uh, Tony.

43:01.844 --> 43:04.168
We don't have
the money to send her

43:04.245 --> 43:06.939
to this fucking place
for $350 dollars an hour.

43:07.016 --> 43:08.935
$350 dollars so you can
tell her to leave me?

43:09.012 --> 43:09.939
Take my son away?

43:10.016 --> 43:12.181
I know what this must
feel like for you.

43:12.258 --> 43:14.170
- No, you don't!
- You can't be here right now.

43:14.247 --> 43:15.634
We can't be in a room
with a locked door.

43:15.711 --> 43:16.970
Oh, why not?
Are you afraid of me?

43:17.047 --> 43:18.181
- Please, can you just let me
- My wife

43:18.258 --> 43:20.598
- out of this room, please?
- And I need to be together.

43:20.753 --> 43:22.777
- We need to heal.
- You're absolutely right.

43:22.854 --> 43:25.484
I'm just... Look, I'm just...
I'm just really sick and tired

43:25.561 --> 43:28.553
of everybody telling me
what to do and how to be.

43:28.630 --> 43:30.530
- Yeah, it must be exhausting.
- When all you do here

43:30.607 --> 43:32.614
is take our money
and make everything worse.

43:32.691 --> 43:34.033
Look, look, just-just...

43:34.183 --> 43:35.658
- No, no...
- Stop talking.

43:35.735 --> 43:38.970
I-I felt my seven-year-old's
body go cold.

43:39.047 --> 43:40.407
I watched her skin
turn blue.

43:40.484 --> 43:41.887
How are you gonna
make that better, huh?

43:41.964 --> 43:42.857
You gonna bring her back

43:42.934 --> 43:44.509
from the fucking dead?

43:52.439 --> 43:53.938
Stay down!

43:59.110 --> 44:00.572
Call security.

44:01.117 --> 44:02.414
Now.

44:08.015 --> 44:11.489
- No, Daddy! Daddy, no!
- Shh. Jamie, come here.

44:11.566 --> 44:14.575
Dad! Please,
that's my daddy!

44:14.652 --> 44:17.945
Daddy! Daddy!

44:18.392 --> 44:20.766
Daddy!

44:33.071 --> 44:34.838
How did you know?

44:35.184 --> 44:37.627
I've seen a lot of guys
with severe PTSD.

44:37.728 --> 44:40.111
He was, uh,
checking his exits.

44:40.234 --> 44:41.507
He kept his back
to the wall.

44:41.584 --> 44:43.536
He was rubbing his thumb
and index finger like this.

44:43.613 --> 44:45.377
Uh, I need a drink.

44:46.641 --> 44:48.416
Don't look at me.
I-I don't drink.

44:48.526 --> 44:49.947
Seven months sober.

44:50.266 --> 44:52.518
Okay. How about
a coffee, then?

44:52.725 --> 44:53.920
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

44:53.997 --> 44:55.383
Okay.

44:57.107 --> 44:58.848
Yeah, when I got back
from my second tour,

44:58.925 --> 45:00.174
I was a disaster.

45:00.251 --> 45:03.080
I'd been there for
18 months straight, and, uh,

45:03.891 --> 45:06.283
I just didn't know
who I was anymore.

45:06.933 --> 45:09.955
I didn't know what to say
to my family, to my friends.

45:10.725 --> 45:12.721
I found everything confusing.

45:12.798 --> 45:15.885
You know, um, grocery store,
traffic lights.

45:16.469 --> 45:17.681
Why traffic lights?

45:17.758 --> 45:19.552
It's all about
your environment.

45:19.629 --> 45:20.778
Your context.

45:20.855 --> 45:23.106
So, in a war zone,

45:23.183 --> 45:24.390
you know, traffic lights
mean nothing.

45:24.467 --> 45:26.315
Nobody pays
attention to them.

45:26.766 --> 45:29.028
But then I get back here,
and I'm stopped at a light.

45:29.105 --> 45:30.502
Nobody's coming, but...

45:30.639 --> 45:32.475
I'm supposed to stay there
until the light turns green?

45:32.552 --> 45:33.501
- Right.
- That just doesn't

45:33.578 --> 45:34.625
make sense anymore.

45:34.702 --> 45:35.772
Understand.

45:35.849 --> 45:38.390
The thing about
PTSD, it's...

45:38.467 --> 45:41.338
it's not the guy that jumps
when a car backfires.

45:41.756 --> 45:44.039
You know, that's...
that's just someone

45:44.116 --> 45:45.653
who just came back
from a dangerous place.

45:45.730 --> 45:47.057
That's training.

45:47.850 --> 45:49.655
You know, there's nothing
wrong with that person.

45:49.732 --> 45:52.510
They just need
some time to adjust.

45:54.110 --> 45:57.971
But... true PTSD,
I mean, it's...

45:59.000 --> 46:00.494
it's different.

46:01.076 --> 46:02.367
It makes no sense.

46:02.444 --> 46:03.932
It's, uh...

46:04.558 --> 46:06.142
Endless.

46:08.744 --> 46:10.202
Yeah.

46:10.529 --> 46:12.322
Is that why
you stopped drinking?

46:12.781 --> 46:14.317
- From PTSD?
- Uh-huh.

46:14.394 --> 46:15.481
No.

46:15.558 --> 46:17.555
Um, not exactly.

46:18.961 --> 46:21.833
When I, uh, first got back,
I felt really numb,

46:21.978 --> 46:25.143
and I, uh, had a
hard time being...

46:27.563 --> 46:29.158
being intimate.

46:29.724 --> 46:30.852
Oh.

46:30.959 --> 46:33.577
Yeah. I... I mean,
I couldn't, you know,

46:33.654 --> 46:35.895
which, for a guy,
is worse than being dead,

46:35.972 --> 46:38.424
so I drank a lot.

46:39.207 --> 46:40.390
And then I could have sex.

46:40.467 --> 46:41.650
Right. Got it.

46:41.727 --> 46:44.186
This vicious cycle
where I'd feel lonely

46:44.263 --> 46:46.432
and I wanted to be
close to someone.

46:47.203 --> 46:48.335
So I'd get wasted,
but then half the time,

46:48.412 --> 46:50.403
I wouldn't be able
to get it up anyway,

46:50.480 --> 46:52.440
and it just was this...

46:55.938 --> 46:57.313
Sorry.

46:57.641 --> 47:00.002
Why am I telling you this?
Honestly.

47:00.266 --> 47:01.516
I asked.

47:04.641 --> 47:06.757
I-I don't usually just
vomit my life story

47:06.834 --> 47:08.208
within four hours
of meeting someone.

47:08.285 --> 47:09.492
You know?

47:10.192 --> 47:13.564
Look, uh, I guess
this is a...

47:13.662 --> 47:15.984
a special case,
considering you...

47:16.061 --> 47:18.143
- I mean, I...
- Saved my life?

47:20.459 --> 47:22.042
Continue.

47:24.153 --> 47:26.032
Anyway, I, uh...

47:26.109 --> 47:29.627
I joined A.A.
and changed my life.

47:31.078 --> 47:33.260
Now I'm sober and abstinent.

47:33.562 --> 47:34.652
It's part
of the program:

47:34.729 --> 47:36.791
no dating, no sex
for the first year.

47:37.414 --> 47:40.565
Well, that's one way to deal
with your impotency issue.

47:42.054 --> 47:43.932
Yeah. Exactly.

47:46.078 --> 47:48.298
Here's what I figure.

47:48.876 --> 47:52.369
Maybe if I just concentrate
on myself for a while,

47:53.242 --> 47:56.955
maybe eventually I'll meet
someone I feel safe with.

47:57.253 --> 47:58.450
Someone I can trust

47:58.527 --> 48:01.612
and I won't have
to get wasted to love her.

48:01.922 --> 48:03.270
In fact, I won't even want to

48:03.347 --> 48:05.473
because I won't want
to miss any of it.

48:12.313 --> 48:13.711
So...

48:14.407 --> 48:15.971
what about you?

48:18.351 --> 48:19.769
- Uh...
- Are you married?

48:19.846 --> 48:20.925
No.

48:21.002 --> 48:22.374
Ever been married?

48:23.141 --> 48:24.578
Twice.

48:26.102 --> 48:27.895
- Yeah.
- Kids?

48:31.334 --> 48:33.377
Yeah, I have a daughter.

48:34.146 --> 48:35.825
So you're a single
working mom.

48:35.902 --> 48:37.486
That's right.

48:37.633 --> 48:39.296
I was raised by a single mom.

48:39.373 --> 48:40.714
Baddest motherfuckers
in the world,

48:40.791 --> 48:42.327
and I spent eight years
in the Marines.

48:42.404 --> 48:43.703
Thank you.

48:44.766 --> 48:45.856
How old's your kid?

48:45.933 --> 48:47.541
Uh, she's six.

48:47.633 --> 48:49.869
I can't believe it, but she is.

48:50.110 --> 48:51.328
Hmm.

48:57.344 --> 48:59.856
Yeah, I-I have
to get going.

48:59.933 --> 49:01.272
- It's getting late.
- Yeah, I should...

49:01.349 --> 49:02.598
- I should let you go home. Um...
- Yeah.

49:02.675 --> 49:04.768
Well, it was really nice
talking to you.

49:04.870 --> 49:06.549
You're fascinating.

49:08.112 --> 49:10.194
See, uh, yeah,
this would be the part

49:10.271 --> 49:12.893
where I'd probably ask you out
if I wasn't in the program.

49:16.072 --> 49:19.526
Um, thank you again
for what you did today.

49:20.430 --> 49:21.683
Yeah.

49:28.711 --> 49:30.149
Ben?

49:30.433 --> 49:33.119
How long do you have left
with your program?

49:34.519 --> 49:36.838
Five months, two weeks
and three days.

49:37.111 --> 49:38.721
But who's counting?

49:44.986 --> 49:46.358
Hurry up, sweetie.

49:46.435 --> 49:47.932
We're gonna be late.

49:53.641 --> 49:55.486
Here. Hold this.

49:55.563 --> 49:57.646
Strap yourself in.

49:59.375 --> 50:00.649
Okay.

50:10.007 --> 50:11.516
Come on.

50:13.235 --> 50:14.727
All right.

50:15.613 --> 50:17.352
Come on.

50:20.788 --> 50:22.483
Joanie, did you turn
this light on?

50:22.560 --> 50:23.585
Yes.

50:23.662 --> 50:24.779
When?

50:24.856 --> 50:26.147
Yesterday.

50:26.224 --> 50:27.549
Oh, shit.

50:32.602 --> 50:34.940
Um... all right.

50:44.438 --> 50:46.225
I'm sorry.

50:46.308 --> 50:47.710
You're the only
person I know

50:47.787 --> 50:49.455
who still has
jumper cables.

50:49.923 --> 50:51.371
Oh, my God.

50:51.448 --> 50:53.065
What the fuck happened
to your face?

50:53.142 --> 50:54.447
Pop the hood.

50:57.875 --> 50:59.335
I'm just
not that interested

50:59.412 --> 51:00.536
in keeping the place.

51:00.613 --> 51:02.955
It holds a lot of
complicated memories.

51:03.633 --> 51:06.307
I'm just trying
to move on with my life.

51:07.172 --> 51:10.180
I would hardly call what
you're doing "moving on."

51:10.925 --> 51:12.383
Why not?

51:13.242 --> 51:14.564
If you were truly
trying to move on,

51:14.641 --> 51:15.630
you wouldn't be
spending all your time

51:15.707 --> 51:17.447
with people who
reminded you of Gabriel.

51:17.550 --> 51:21.463
You have practically made
his death your entire identity.

51:23.975 --> 51:26.861
What is your...
what is wrong with you?

51:28.141 --> 51:30.239
What is wrong with wanting
to use my experience

51:30.316 --> 51:32.564
to help people?
And what are you doing

51:32.641 --> 51:34.283
with your life
that's so much better?

51:34.437 --> 51:35.679
Yeah, maybe
the reason you can't

51:35.756 --> 51:37.540
let go of the damn
Lobster Roll

51:37.617 --> 51:38.952
is because you don't
have a fucking clue

51:39.029 --> 51:40.877
what else to do with your time.

51:44.298 --> 51:45.813
Thank you.

51:47.961 --> 51:49.375
All right, kiddo.

51:49.776 --> 51:51.231
Let's get you to school.

51:51.610 --> 51:52.774
Hop up.

51:56.482 --> 51:58.436
Are you taking me
to school?

51:58.589 --> 51:59.947
No. Your mother is.

52:00.024 --> 52:02.205
Why can't you
both take me?

52:03.699 --> 52:05.239
Please.
Just this once.

52:05.316 --> 52:07.190
Like the other kids.

52:09.842 --> 52:11.242
Joanie.

52:17.890 --> 52:19.677
Don't forget you have
the field trip today, hon.

52:19.754 --> 52:21.839
I know.
It's at the aquarium.

52:21.948 --> 52:23.674
You've never been
to an aquarium.

52:23.751 --> 52:25.350
I know.

52:27.903 --> 52:29.252
Okay, sweetie?

52:29.329 --> 52:30.626
Have fun.

52:34.983 --> 52:36.383
Backpack?

53:00.998 --> 53:03.299
You know, the Roll
wasn't even your idea.

53:03.508 --> 53:05.346
Let me guess, it was yours.

53:05.654 --> 53:07.029
No.

53:07.152 --> 53:08.857
It was Scotty's.

53:10.406 --> 53:12.743
It was his big dream,
his plan to go straight.

53:12.820 --> 53:14.627
- What are you saying?
- I don't know.

53:14.704 --> 53:16.274
I guess I'm asking.

53:16.351 --> 53:18.899
Why do you think you're
holding onto it so hard?

53:24.141 --> 53:26.721
It's also something
you and I built together.

53:57.392 --> 53:59.084
Uh, yeah, that's right.

53:59.161 --> 54:00.779
It's Alison Bailey.

54:00.856 --> 54:04.503
B-A-I-L-E-Y.

54:05.337 --> 54:07.126
Just one.

54:07.776 --> 54:10.397
Yeah, I'm from
the Woodlawn Center.

54:10.558 --> 54:11.947
I'm a trainee.

54:12.024 --> 54:13.480
Yeah, that's right.

54:17.435 --> 54:20.102
Um... great. October 1.

54:20.179 --> 54:21.357
I'm looking forward to it.

54:21.434 --> 54:23.112
Okay, thank you.

54:36.389 --> 54:37.806
Hey.

54:38.037 --> 54:39.506
Hi.

54:39.912 --> 54:43.125
So... I was just wondering,

54:43.636 --> 54:44.995
what are you doing
in five months,

54:45.072 --> 54:46.688
two weeks and two days?
