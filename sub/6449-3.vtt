35:37.051 --> 35:39.588
A buddy of mine
at the Inquisitor ran it for me...

35:39.762 --> 35:43.050
...since leather and lace
really isn't Planet fare.

35:43.516 --> 35:47.555
Lois, I think you went too far trying
to discredit this annoying hero-basher.

35:47.728 --> 35:48.888
You could have been killed.

35:49.063 --> 35:52.055
Godfrey was undermining
Metropolis' faith in its defenders.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.939
I couldn'tjust stand by
and let that happen.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.939
Well, what you did was brave, but....

35:57.864 --> 35:59.650
Between you and me, I was terriﬁed.

36:01.742 --> 36:05.280
My worst fear is to be alone
in the world without heroes.

36:08.916 --> 36:12.750
Thank God, Ubergirl—
Powergirl? Megagirl?

36:12.920 --> 36:15.081
Was there to save me
from the gallows.

36:15.423 --> 36:17.584
Your cousin needs a better handle.

36:18.217 --> 36:22.176
Well, just remember that heroes like her
or the Blur—

36:24.265 --> 36:26.927
Put them on too high a pedestal,
they might let you down.

36:27.727 --> 36:31.595
Thanks, Clark, but I get it that
the superpowered are people too.

36:31.772 --> 36:35.890
They wrestle with their own ﬂaws
but the Blur is different.

36:38.613 --> 36:40.604
He's my hero.

36:40.948 --> 36:44.782
No matter what he's afraid of,
I know he'll always be there for me.

36:56.422 --> 36:58.959
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

36:59.717 --> 37:01.457
Kara?

37:02.303 --> 37:04.635
What do you think of my new look?

37:05.264 --> 37:08.802
I think you look completely different.
Why the sudden cover-up?

37:09.644 --> 37:12.807
You can't save people
when you're the center of attention.

37:13.731 --> 37:17.223
But I'm not going anywhere until I know
Earth is safe from the darkness.

37:19.111 --> 37:20.612
It could be anywhere.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.486
Look, I was wondering.

37:22.657 --> 37:27.617
Your bracelet seemed to repel
the darkness, not send it away.

37:27.787 --> 37:30.119
I don't think
the bracelet will work as a portal.

37:30.289 --> 37:33.781
The dark spirit is trapped
inside of a host.

37:33.960 --> 37:37.373
But you're superpowered.
Why wouldn't the darkness want you?

37:38.756 --> 37:40.166
It's because you're pure of spirit.

37:40.341 --> 37:44.300
That's why you could never lure the
darkness to you with all of your saves.

37:44.470 --> 37:46.506
I don't feel pure of spirit.

37:47.348 --> 37:50.010
I have just as many issues
as anyone else.

37:50.184 --> 37:52.175
But still, you risked your soul
to save me.

37:52.353 --> 37:53.843
And if you hadn'tjumped between us--

37:54.021 --> 37:56.512
The dark spirit would have possessed
you, Kal-El.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.895
Like he could see things
in me I didn't want to face.

38:00.069 --> 38:05.359
Now imagine that creature
wielding all of your powers.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.657
People of this planet would be doomed.

38:10.538 --> 38:13.871
You sound like my father,
that I was destined to fail.

38:15.418 --> 38:17.704
Failure is something
we have to live with...

38:18.879 --> 38:21.871
...but it's how you overcome it
that deﬁnes you.

38:26.679 --> 38:29.386
I know this isn't easy for you...

38:29.890 --> 38:32.927
...but I need you to leave the darkness
to me.

38:34.895 --> 38:38.058
This isn't your ﬁght.

38:53.247 --> 38:56.034
Makes you wonder if we put
too much faith in vigilantes.

39:01.213 --> 39:04.580
Maybe the Blur isn't the hero
he thinks he is.

39:07.887 --> 39:09.548
Who's your mama?

39:09.722 --> 39:11.383
-ls that a trick question?
-Ha-ha-ha.

39:11.557 --> 39:12.717
What's, uh--? What is this?

39:12.892 --> 39:15.429
That is the only copy of the chapter
on Green Arrow...

39:15.603 --> 39:17.969
...that Godfrey was gonna reveal today.

39:18.147 --> 39:19.978
Yours truly picked Godfrey's pocket...

39:20.149 --> 39:23.266
...so you can rest assured
your secret is safe.

39:25.654 --> 39:27.030
Hmm.

39:27.865 --> 39:30.322
Wow, Lois, 007's got nothing
on you.

39:30.493 --> 39:32.654
You're a brilliant and talented
super sleuth.

39:33.788 --> 39:35.574
Thank you. I appreciate it.

39:35.748 --> 39:38.490
I know how much trouble
you must have gone to to get this.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.256
What is this?

39:47.426 --> 39:50.793
Does this have anything to do with why
Chloe took an extended vacation?

39:50.971 --> 39:52.802
About that.

39:53.474 --> 39:56.637
Chloe's not catching a tan on a beach
like I told you she was.

39:56.811 --> 39:58.676
The truth is...

39:59.438 --> 40:02.145
...she left, and I don't think
she's coming back.

40:02.608 --> 40:05.816
-What happened? Is she okay?
-She's okay, she's ﬁne...

40:05.986 --> 40:08.193
...but when the person that you love
knows your secret...

40:08.364 --> 40:09.774
...it becomes their secret too.

40:09.949 --> 40:12.190
And she was willing to give up
everything to protect it...

40:12.368 --> 40:13.824
...which, unfortunately included me.

40:14.328 --> 40:18.617
Wait, I think that
she probably just needs space.

40:18.791 --> 40:21.783
I know how she feels about you,
she'll be back.

40:23.629 --> 40:25.494
I hope you're right...

40:26.715 --> 40:28.797
...because this has gone on
long enough.

40:31.345 --> 40:33.051
What's happening.
What are you doing, Oliver?

40:35.516 --> 40:37.472
Doing what I have to.

40:39.728 --> 40:42.515
-Send them in, please.
WOMAN [OVER PHONE]: Yes, sir.

40:50.656 --> 40:51.987
Thank you all for coming.

40:53.159 --> 40:55.491
I've brought you here
to make an announcement.

40:55.661 --> 40:59.153
People have these
so-called vigilantes all wrong.

40:59.707 --> 41:02.699
There's only one way for me
to set the record straight.

41:04.962 --> 41:06.748
I am Green Arrow.

41:07.548 --> 41:11.086
Mr. Queen, please. What inspired you
to become the masked archer?

41:52.301 --> 41:54.292
[English - US - SDH]
