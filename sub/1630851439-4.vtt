01:36.430 --> 01:40.976
Once, a man came to
Hari Seldon and asked to be told his fate.

01:48.901 --> 01:50.110
He wanted to know

01:50.194 --> 01:53.488
whether the predictive models could chart
the significance of his life.

01:58.285 --> 02:02.289
But Hari told him only the movements
of masses could be predicted.

02:05.334 --> 02:10.214
The fate of one individual
will always remain a mystery.

02:54.132 --> 02:56.468
The clockwork of civilization…

02:59.304 --> 03:01.807
the rise and fall of cultures…

03:04.309 --> 03:06.478
causes and worlds…

03:09.439 --> 03:13.193
These were answers
Hari Seldon had long since unriddled.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.949
Belief is a powerful weapon.

03:20.701 --> 03:25.038
That's why the Empire feared
Hari Seldon's predictions so much.

03:26.707 --> 03:32.713
Empires govern worldly concerns,
but what comes after? Our souls?

03:33.463 --> 03:35.674
These realms are the purview of faith.

03:35.757 --> 03:40.929
And faith is a sword
forged in the fires of the infinite.

04:26.141 --> 04:28.977
Empire?
Do you seek different amusement?

04:29.061 --> 04:33.565
You'll do. For the routine pleasures
in the routine manner.

04:33.649 --> 04:36.235
Which pleasures do you prefer, Empire?

04:37.194 --> 04:41.406
Do you offer the pleasure of nothing?
Is that on the menu?

04:42.157 --> 04:45.160
Is it true? No one's allowed to touch you?

04:48.080 --> 04:49.456
Bold, aren't you?

04:49.540 --> 04:54.294
I have only 24 hours of service to you.
I want to make the most of it.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.423
Then try to touch me.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.929
I said try.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.709
The aura repels kinetic energy.

05:35.794 --> 05:40.090
I want you to try it again,
with a softer touch.

05:41.884 --> 05:42.885
Slower.

05:47.431 --> 05:48.432
Slower.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.451
So, how…

06:07.534 --> 06:08.577
…does the rest work?

06:24.051 --> 06:25.469
What?

06:25.552 --> 06:27.179
You are required, Empire.

06:28.597 --> 06:32.100
I understand Empire has
a physiological need for intimacy.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.811
But the current matter
supersedes this need.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.285
Ambassador Thanwall.

06:51.161 --> 06:54.206
Most esteemed Empire, glory to the light--

06:54.289 --> 06:55.832
Out with it, Ambassador.

06:57.251 --> 07:00.254
Proxima Opal has passed, Empire.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.463
Our condolences.

07:01.547 --> 07:03.590
Condolences. Heartfelt.

07:03.674 --> 07:05.551
Thank you, Empire.

07:05.634 --> 07:09.137
Proxima Opal will be missed
and mourned by her flock.

07:09.221 --> 07:13.433
And now the conclave will elevate
her successor, Zephyr Gilat.

07:13.517 --> 07:15.644
A capable candidate. We like her.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.647
Carry our condolences forward, Ambassador.

07:18.730 --> 07:22.734
And inform Gilat
she's always welcome on Trantor.

07:22.818 --> 07:26.697
On the topic of a successor, Empire,

07:26.780 --> 07:29.950
there is some debate.

07:30.659 --> 07:33.954
Another candidate has been
gaining support.

07:35.414 --> 07:36.415
Zephyr Halima.

07:37.457 --> 07:41.628
Halima Ifa does not adhere to
accepted doctrine,

07:41.712 --> 07:44.339
as have our previous proximas.

07:44.423 --> 07:48.177
She is advocating for
a return to the Primary Octavo.

07:49.595 --> 07:50.762
Is she suicidal?

07:51.805 --> 07:54.016
Who is this woman to question our primacy?

07:54.099 --> 07:55.976
A-A-Apologies, Empire. I-I--

07:56.059 --> 07:58.187
-Did you know about this?
-Only moments ago.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.564
When is Opal's funeral?

08:00.647 --> 08:02.357
Two days hence, Empire.

08:15.495 --> 08:19.082
Say nothing of this conversation.
We will contact you shortly.

08:27.549 --> 08:30.052
I helped install the previous Proxima.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.638
I'll leave for the conclave
as soon as possible.

08:32.721 --> 08:35.557
Is that really necessary?
Can't you just holo-cast yourself in?

08:35.640 --> 08:36.642
Not this time.

08:36.725 --> 08:42.523
Luminism claims three trillion followers.
This schism requires a personal touch.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.783
What's the Primary Octavo?

08:53.617 --> 08:56.954
A heretical scripture. Pre-imperial.

08:58.121 --> 09:01.250
It directly links the soul
to individuated sentience.

09:01.834 --> 09:05.254
-What does that mean--
-Individuated sentience.

09:05.337 --> 09:07.047
Think, Brother Dawn.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.758
If a soul cleaves only to
an individual being,

09:09.842 --> 09:13.136
that calls into question
that which cannot be individuated.

09:14.388 --> 09:20.602
All Cleons are
perfect genetic copies of the first.

09:20.686 --> 09:21.687
And therefore…

09:22.521 --> 09:24.189
We don't have souls.

09:25.148 --> 09:28.277
So, this Halima woman is saying
we're, what?

09:29.778 --> 09:30.904
Not human?

09:30.988 --> 09:32.573
Indirectly. But--

09:32.656 --> 09:34.658
And if the galaxy comes to believe

09:34.741 --> 09:37.953
their leaders are less than,
rather than more than themselves,

09:38.036 --> 09:39.746
they may cease to follow.

09:44.877 --> 09:46.336
We are a glass vessel…

09:48.005 --> 09:50.132
spun with a fine hand.

09:52.801 --> 09:57.181
If the pressures inside start to swirl
and we are not uniform…

10:00.392 --> 10:01.602
we may burst.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.818
-Who are you?
-Salvor Hardin.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.404
Warden of Terminus.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.745
Anacreons aren't allowed on imperial soil.

10:23.832 --> 10:24.917
What are you doing here?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.376
Scrapping.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.920
That's a lot of armor for scrappers.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.005
We're looking for
the ship's navigation module.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.966
Any critical components were stripped
from this hulk decades ago.

10:33.050 --> 10:35.802
But, again,
a real scrapper would know that.

10:35.886 --> 10:39.515
You should leave.
Before the Empire catches wind of this.

10:39.598 --> 10:41.517
My people do not fear the Empire.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.149
Look, I caught you by surprise

10:49.233 --> 10:50.609
and now you're improvising.

10:52.194 --> 10:55.364
But if you were gonna kill me,
you would have already.

10:55.447 --> 10:56.740
So what's the play?

11:02.788 --> 11:05.290
That tower. Take us there.

11:05.374 --> 11:06.416
Why?

11:09.253 --> 11:11.380
Let me be clear, Warden.

11:11.463 --> 11:14.216
We know how to use
every resource we come across.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.469
The children we observed earlier,

11:17.553 --> 11:20.138
we've seen how they sneak away
just before dawn,

11:20.222 --> 11:22.724
straying far away from
the rest of your flock.

11:22.808 --> 11:27.229
If you won't lead us to the tower,
we'll simply utilize one of them.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.523
It's not that simple. We have a fence.

11:29.606 --> 11:30.899
We're aware of your fence.

11:30.983 --> 11:32.985
We saw you
perform maintenance on it earlier.

11:33.068 --> 11:36.655
Which makes you
the perfect person to take us through it.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.490
To the tower then!

11:53.338 --> 11:55.340
The fence uses DNA recognition.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.428
It'll radiate anyone
who isn't in the database.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.685
I might be able to get one of you in.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.061
If we walk through together,

12:08.145 --> 12:10.480
the fence should write off
the second person as an error.

12:10.564 --> 12:11.732
Then take us all through it.

12:11.815 --> 12:14.234
This only works once. Maybe.

12:17.779 --> 12:20.741
The only thing I've ever dragged
through this fence was already dead.

12:29.333 --> 12:33.170
I can feel you tensing up. Don't.

12:33.253 --> 12:37.674
If she isn't back within a watch,
we'll raze your city to the ground.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.651
Go. Get the others.

12:55.734 --> 12:57.528
Establish a perimeter
and stay out of sight.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.706
Wanna drive and I'll hold the gun?

13:20.759 --> 13:22.052
Tell me your name, at least.

13:23.011 --> 13:24.304
Are we best friends now?

13:24.805 --> 13:26.348
You've risked a lot coming here.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.767
We've risked everything, Warden.

13:35.858 --> 13:39.778
-No. There was a boy in our path!
-Don't get cute. I have eyes.

13:49.955 --> 13:50.956
The tower's that way.

13:51.039 --> 13:53.125
I'm taking a shortcut.
Fewer watchmen this way.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.256
What is that?

14:04.219 --> 14:05.220
Stop.

14:10.309 --> 14:11.518
Stop.

14:17.691 --> 14:21.153
The stories about Salvor Hardin?
They usually begin here.

14:21.236 --> 14:24.531
The warden and the ghost,

14:24.615 --> 14:26.742
inexplicably bound together.

14:26.825 --> 14:27.826
Thanks.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.545
How did they slip past our radar?

14:38.629 --> 14:41.548
Flew in the nap of the earth. Maybe.

14:41.632 --> 14:42.841
Any sign of their ships?

14:42.925 --> 14:46.136
They claimed to be scrappers.
Said they were after a navigation module.

14:46.220 --> 14:48.472
-Obviously bullshit.
-We need to contact the Empire.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.057
We can't do anything
without authorization.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.017
Come on, Mom.
We're an imperial outpost in name only.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.354
When was the last time they even
contacted us? A decade ago?

14:55.437 --> 14:57.564
They won't defend us.
We need to do it ourselves.

14:57.648 --> 15:00.108
Easy. Violence is the last refuge--

15:00.192 --> 15:02.778
Of the incompetent, I know.
That's an old man's doctrine.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.821
It's an observation I made
when I was younger than you.

15:04.905 --> 15:08.158
Would Hari's plan have assumed
we'd wait for help or act on our own?

15:08.242 --> 15:11.328
Hari is not here, Mom.
We need to help ourselves.

15:15.499 --> 15:17.334
Welcome back, best friend.

15:18.252 --> 15:21.547
You left the conversation just as we were
really getting to know each other.

15:21.630 --> 15:22.756
Headache?

15:22.840 --> 15:24.716
Teeth feel like they're falling out?

15:24.800 --> 15:26.510
What was that cursed thing?

15:26.593 --> 15:28.595
It was here
when we colonized Terminus.

15:28.679 --> 15:32.266
Didn't show up on any of our scans.
I guess it didn't show up on yours either.

15:32.349 --> 15:34.309
Why did it not affect you?

15:34.393 --> 15:37.980
Let's just say I'm the last person
on Terminus you wanted to come across.

15:39.022 --> 15:39.940
So…

15:41.233 --> 15:42.776
what now, Warden?

15:44.945 --> 15:46.655
She had a small army with her.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.949
An-- And their tracks,
some of them were deep.

15:49.032 --> 15:52.494
Shorter stride lengths.
As if they were carrying heavy equipment.

15:53.036 --> 15:54.955
Like they're planning on digging in, Dad.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.708
-Well, what do you wanna do?
-I don't know.

15:58.292 --> 16:00.210
I've been following my instincts, and--

16:00.294 --> 16:01.920
I don't know, maybe it was just dumb luck.

16:02.004 --> 16:04.381
Your instincts didn't just
lead you to the ships.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.633
They led you to her. And you stopped her.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.428
If you were better at math,

16:09.511 --> 16:13.015
you'd know that repeated luck was
more than just luck, Salvor.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.851
Whether your mother wants
to admit it or not,

16:15.934 --> 16:19.938
we have been following your lead from
the moment you pulled yourself upright.

16:20.856 --> 16:24.526
It's no accident
the people made you warden.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.237
So lead us.

16:39.416 --> 16:42.711
I have never had the pleasure, Empire.
How may I be of service?

16:42.794 --> 16:44.046
Captain Obrecht, is it?

16:44.129 --> 16:47.549
Shadowmaster, Empire.
Shadowmaster Obrecht.

16:47.633 --> 16:48.884
A fine likeness.

16:51.428 --> 16:54.640
What's the protocol for dealing
with a problem palace attendant?

16:54.723 --> 16:56.850
What level of attendant,
if I may ask?

16:57.601 --> 17:00.938
-Someone who works in the garden.
-May I ask the nature of the problem?

17:01.021 --> 17:03.482
You may not. I just want her name.

17:04.107 --> 17:07.944
I can ascertain that, Empire.
Along with anything else you may require.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.238
That's all for now.

17:18.539 --> 17:21.541
I saw at least a dozen Anacreons
outside the fence.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.544
Travik, take the southern loop.

17:23.627 --> 17:25.295
Kalin, cover the west.

17:25.378 --> 17:29.132
Yate, I want you on the east so you can
spot anyone coming over that ridge.

17:29.216 --> 17:32.970
And if we see any of these guys,
what are we supposed to do?

17:33.053 --> 17:34.054
Nothing.

17:34.137 --> 17:37.140
Don't shoot at them, don't speak to them.
Just watch 'em and keep me informed.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.852
-What's this about Anacreons on Terminus?
-Calls herself Phara.

17:39.935 --> 17:42.396
Beyond that,
nothing about her story adds up.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.815
If anyone can tell
whether somebody's lying, it's you.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.192
That's just the thing.
I can't tell if she's lying

17:47.276 --> 17:49.027
or if she's just not telling the truth.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.279
Is there a difference?

17:50.821 --> 17:52.990
I've got a plan.
But I'm gonna need your help.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.164
What's this? Torture?

18:01.248 --> 18:03.625
He's my manservant.

18:03.709 --> 18:07.087
Runs and fetches.
Reseals my boots when they need it.

18:07.171 --> 18:12.509
I'm thinking a watch has passed,
as far as my weald-men are concerned.

18:12.593 --> 18:13.969
Why are you really here, Phara?

18:15.470 --> 18:17.472
Salvor has a talent for reading people.

18:18.473 --> 18:21.101
It's uncanny, really.
I was just telling her mother about it.

18:21.602 --> 18:22.811
She doesn't believe you.

18:22.895 --> 18:25.564
Well, you told her you're my boss.
Now my praise rings hollow.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.191
What's your interest
in the Foundation Tower?

18:27.274 --> 18:31.278
The module. I already told you.
You keep asking me the same questions.

18:31.361 --> 18:34.239
I'm giving you a chance
to give better answers.

18:34.323 --> 18:35.657
Crowns.

18:38.702 --> 18:41.288
I know you're after something else.

18:41.371 --> 18:45.626
We don't have any Anacreon artifacts,
no heavy weapons, so what--

18:45.709 --> 18:46.960
This is going in circles.

18:48.420 --> 18:49.421
Explain it to her.

18:49.922 --> 18:51.590
Just give her what she wants.

18:51.673 --> 18:53.759
Your accent's not terrible.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.887
You were taught by someone
in the port city, obviously.

18:57.721 --> 18:59.097
Those lazy vowels.

18:59.181 --> 19:00.599
I'm a trader.

19:01.099 --> 19:03.519
I do business with your people
now and then.

19:03.894 --> 19:06.688
Thought I smelled a whiff
of Thespin on you.

19:07.022 --> 19:09.733
I want the navigation module. That's it.

19:09.816 --> 19:10.984
Another lie.

19:11.527 --> 19:12.861
You speak Anacreon as well?

19:12.945 --> 19:14.029
Not a word.

19:14.112 --> 19:15.697
-Yet you know I'm lying?
-Cats.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.243
That was a 50-50 chance.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.702
Cats again. Who are you really?

19:24.331 --> 19:26.333
Twenty-five percent chance there.

19:26.416 --> 19:27.709
Now it's back to crowns.

19:29.086 --> 19:31.797
Twelve and a half percent.
And another crown. Why are you here?

19:32.756 --> 19:33.924
Another crown again.

19:47.020 --> 19:51.483
I'd give you the percentage,
but repeated luck is never luck.

19:56.738 --> 19:57.739
Who are you?

19:58.240 --> 20:00.701
We're scrappers. The module.

20:00.784 --> 20:03.829
You're not scrappers. And the navigation
module's a distraction--

20:03.912 --> 20:05.539
Enough of these child games.

20:05.622 --> 20:08.292
Take this Thespin thug off his leash
and let him get on with it!

20:08.375 --> 20:09.376
Your scars…

20:10.669 --> 20:11.670
keloids.

20:16.592 --> 20:18.051
Your left eye…

20:19.636 --> 20:20.637
nano-glass.

20:20.721 --> 20:23.515
You lose it when
the Empire bombed Anacreon?

20:23.599 --> 20:26.768
I imagine you must have been, what,
five, six at the time?

20:26.852 --> 20:31.523
Neutron bombs have a low explosive yield
but a high amount of ionizing radiation.

20:31.607 --> 20:35.652
Now, I know about 50% of the population
died off within a week,

20:35.736 --> 20:38.780
another 20 or 30
within the remaining year.

20:39.364 --> 20:42.117
Odds are you came out the other end
an orphan, right?

20:43.702 --> 20:47.164
Probably lost a mom and dad.

20:47.998 --> 20:50.125
Boiled alive.

20:51.835 --> 20:53.921
Or maybe s-slower.

20:54.713 --> 20:55.714
Cancer.

20:58.175 --> 21:02.971
Thyroid for your mother.
Her voice, it changed before she died.

21:03.055 --> 21:05.682
Who else did you lose? A sister?

21:10.812 --> 21:11.897
A brother.

21:15.150 --> 21:16.818
A little brother.

21:34.211 --> 21:36.547
There's a deadness inside her.
It's like a--

21:36.630 --> 21:39.925
It's like a well with no bottom,
just sucking everything in.

21:41.593 --> 21:42.803
She wants to die.

21:44.388 --> 21:48.100
She wants everyone to die. I felt it.

21:53.814 --> 21:56.066
What she said when she broke,
did you understand any of it?

21:56.149 --> 21:58.777
Some, yeah. It's archaic Anacreon,
not the common vernacular.

21:58.861 --> 22:02.239
Well, she slipped up.
Because I understood something too.

22:03.031 --> 22:06.577
A name I remember from the holos.
Larken Keaen.

22:10.414 --> 22:12.040
During the Anthor Belt dispute,

22:12.124 --> 22:14.376
Anacreon and Thespis brought gifts
to the Emperor.

22:14.459 --> 22:15.961
My people's was the Book of Ablut--

22:16.044 --> 22:18.338
And Anacreon's was a bow
carved for its greatest hunter.

22:18.964 --> 22:20.632
-Larken Keaen.
-Meaning?

22:20.716 --> 22:22.467
Phara's not just some junker.

22:23.302 --> 22:25.179
She's the Grand Huntress of Anacreon.

22:35.355 --> 22:38.609
All this unrest, who's responsible for it?

22:39.318 --> 22:41.945
Sinkers. A nom de guerre.

22:42.446 --> 22:47.993
After the heat sink meltdown on level 77.
It was caused when the Star Bridge fell.

22:48.076 --> 22:51.955
And 35 years later we're still grappling
with the aftereffects.

22:54.416 --> 22:59.588
The businesses of Empire is
a cascade of competing priorities.

23:00.214 --> 23:03.425
Brother Day will need your support
while I tend to the conclave.

23:04.384 --> 23:05.594
It's overwhelming.

23:05.677 --> 23:06.887
For one man.

23:07.971 --> 23:10.516
Fortunately, there are three of us.

23:10.599 --> 23:14.269
Bad tidings also come in threes.
Have you heard the news, Brother?

23:15.020 --> 23:18.941
A communications buoy
in the Arcturus Sector has come off-line.

23:19.024 --> 23:21.985
They must go off-line
all the time, right?

23:22.069 --> 23:24.363
We probably have thousands of them
across the galaxy.

23:24.446 --> 23:25.697
Tens of thousands.

23:25.781 --> 23:29.034
But only one that handles communications
in the Outer Reach.

23:30.285 --> 23:32.621
I see that you fail to grasp
the significance.

23:33.330 --> 23:34.748
It's Terminus.

23:36.250 --> 23:39.795
It's where Brother Dusk exiled
Hari Seldon's followers.

23:43.507 --> 23:48.262
The Reach. The conclave. Insurgency…

23:50.055 --> 23:52.224
Do you see a pattern forming here?

23:53.225 --> 23:54.226
Show them.

23:56.103 --> 24:00.357
Sensing vulnerability, soon other players
will begin to apply downward pressure.

24:01.024 --> 24:05.696
An exhortation from one of the galaxy's
major religions is a given.

24:05.779 --> 24:08.615
Or perhaps a homegrown insurrection
here on Trantor.

24:09.283 --> 24:14.872
If the fall can be accelerated,
can it not also be slowed?

24:14.955 --> 24:16.081
Now look at you, Brother.

24:16.164 --> 24:19.585
So smugly self-assured
atop the middle throne.

24:19.668 --> 24:22.004
I used to practice that smile
in the mirror.

24:22.087 --> 24:24.173
Enough. I know how the scene ends.

24:24.256 --> 24:26.049
But have you embraced its lessons?

24:26.133 --> 24:29.136
Luminism.
The Sinker insurrection happening now.

24:29.219 --> 24:31.763
Seldon all but drew you a to-do list.

24:33.015 --> 24:34.016
And you ignored him.

24:34.099 --> 24:35.726
Because he was a charlatan.

24:35.809 --> 24:37.561
You offer nothing new.

24:38.103 --> 24:41.023
Just a younger grape…

24:41.607 --> 24:42.733
from the same vine,

24:43.233 --> 24:46.069
destined for the same old bottle.

24:46.153 --> 24:48.238
You can't save yourselves…

24:48.322 --> 24:50.282
but you can save your legacy.

24:51.950 --> 24:53.994
Hari Seldon is long dead.

24:55.204 --> 24:57.456
Murdered by his protégé, no less.

24:57.539 --> 25:00.167
The man was murdered.
But what about the movement, Brother?

25:02.419 --> 25:04.630
Martyrs tend to have a long half-life.

25:13.305 --> 25:17.226
Thanks to you, we are now staring down
the barrel of a genuine diplomatic crisis.

25:17.309 --> 25:19.269
What was I supposed to do, Lewis?

25:19.353 --> 25:21.146
Let Phara kill me
and then move on to the kids?

25:21.230 --> 25:22.856
You shouldn't have questioned her
without me.

25:22.940 --> 25:24.608
Be glad I did. We know who she is now.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.693
We have leverage.
We can bargain with her people.

25:26.777 --> 25:28.570
If this choice
inflames the city into violence,

25:28.654 --> 25:30.531
you have achieved
elaborate suicide for us all.

25:30.614 --> 25:32.991
Didn't Hari say
the Foundation survives the first crisis?

25:33.075 --> 25:36.870
Yes, he did. But, as I've told you before,
you are an outlier.

25:36.954 --> 25:38.080
-Meaning?
-Salvor.

25:38.163 --> 25:39.748
Meaning that you weren't accounted for.

25:39.831 --> 25:41.291
You have a connection with the Vault

25:41.375 --> 25:43.627
which couldn't have possibly
have been predicted.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.170
You are not baked into the model.

25:45.254 --> 25:46.713
You're saying I'm not part of God's plan.

25:46.797 --> 25:49.049
I am saying psychohistory
can't account for individuals.

25:49.132 --> 25:50.634
So you're saying
I've destroyed God's plan?

25:50.717 --> 25:53.053
-It's time to take a step back, Salvor.
-Step back?

25:53.136 --> 25:55.097
I thought the whole damn point
of the Foundation

25:55.180 --> 25:57.558
was preparing for the unthinkable.

25:57.641 --> 25:59.726
When I asked for more defensive weapons,

25:59.810 --> 26:02.354
you said the likelihood of an attack
seemed remote.

26:02.437 --> 26:04.481
When I wanted to run more drills, nothing.

26:05.065 --> 26:06.859
So here we are now, not prepared.

26:06.942 --> 26:11.154
I might be an outlier, but I'm not
the one screwing up the Plan, Lewis.

26:18.370 --> 26:20.414
Lewis Pirenne, director.

26:20.497 --> 26:24.418
Now, why would the Anacreon Council
send its highest-ranking military officer

26:24.501 --> 26:26.295
to an imperial outpost?

26:26.378 --> 26:28.964
Is that what you're pretending
your little doomsday cult is?

26:29.047 --> 26:30.883
Because I don't see the Empire anywhere.

26:30.966 --> 26:34.553
All I see are academics, laborers
and very few guns.

26:34.636 --> 26:35.929
You took down the comms buoy.

26:36.013 --> 26:39.558
Of course. We wanted to operate
in private, away from prying eyes.

26:39.641 --> 26:42.728
You have to know the Empire will send
someone to investigate eventually.

26:43.562 --> 26:44.855
Or is that the point?

26:44.938 --> 26:46.773
Your women are so much sharper
than your men.

26:47.983 --> 26:51.695
The barbarian kingdoms are exiled.
You have no business here.

26:53.405 --> 26:54.656
"Barbarians."

26:55.657 --> 26:57.951
Just a convenient slur
for anyone not like you.

26:58.535 --> 27:02.122
Trantor left us all here to die.
Your people and mine.

27:02.206 --> 27:03.999
We're just dying at different speeds.

27:04.082 --> 27:05.417
The Foundation isn't dying.

27:05.501 --> 27:09.087
We are fulfilling the mission
Hari Seldon entrusted us with.

27:09.171 --> 27:12.841
Seldon also predicted that the fall
would begin at the edge of the galaxy.

27:13.967 --> 27:15.385
-Here.
-The same science

27:15.469 --> 27:17.471
that saved the Imperial Palace
when the Star Bridge fell

27:17.554 --> 27:18.764
protects Terminus City.

27:18.847 --> 27:20.265
You mean your energy barrier?

27:21.433 --> 27:25.395
A weapon's only as good as
the man who's wielding it.

27:40.619 --> 27:41.870
Kalin, what's your situation?

27:41.954 --> 27:43.872
It's getting pretty crowded over here.

27:43.956 --> 27:46.208
-I think I need backup.
-Not happening.

27:46.291 --> 27:49.586
Salvor saw a dozen. You're telling me
we've got Anacreons all over?

27:49.670 --> 27:52.506
I'm telling you I'm seeing enough guns
to take out the whole town.

27:53.924 --> 27:55.008
Empire.

27:59.429 --> 28:00.639
The matter we discussed?

28:01.890 --> 28:05.477
Her name is Azura Odili.
A palace botanist since the age of 13.

28:06.061 --> 28:09.523
Her father, deceased, was also
an agroecologist in the gardens.

28:10.065 --> 28:13.277
Her mother founded
a school for the ikebana, now closed.

28:14.736 --> 28:16.196
You said there was a problem?

28:17.865 --> 28:21.159
How are problems generally solved
in this situation?

28:21.910 --> 28:26.415
Any manner that achieves its goal.
My job is to eliminate problems, Empire.

28:39.052 --> 28:40.804
Azura Odili.

28:43.682 --> 28:45.684
Oh-dee-lee? Oh-dih-lee?

28:45.767 --> 28:46.852
Dee, Empire.

28:46.935 --> 28:48.854
You were outside my chambers earlier.

28:50.439 --> 28:53.066
-Want to know what you think you saw.
-I saw nothing, Empire.

28:53.150 --> 28:54.902
No. I believe you saw something.

28:54.985 --> 28:57.154
I only see what Empire wants me to see.

28:57.237 --> 28:59.489
I could have you removed
from your station,

29:00.574 --> 29:02.743
sent to scrub the heat sinks on level 80.

29:02.826 --> 29:06.079
I could do worse to you. Much worse.

29:06.163 --> 29:07.372
You know all this.

29:07.456 --> 29:09.958
Empire, Brother Dusk
has asked me to summon you.

29:10.042 --> 29:11.376
Tell him I'm coming.

29:13.337 --> 29:14.838
Remove this entire bed.

29:15.464 --> 29:18.217
From my chambers
the smell of the blossoms is overbearing.

29:18.300 --> 29:21.470
-Empire, you needn't bother with this--
-It's settled. You can go.

29:25.432 --> 29:26.934
Wolvesbreath helps with the pain.

29:27.768 --> 29:29.520
The brownish-green leaves
with the red stripe.

29:29.603 --> 29:31.104
They reduce the swelling and bruising--

29:31.188 --> 29:33.649
I don't recall asking
for your medical advice.

29:35.526 --> 29:36.527
Which?

29:59.591 --> 30:00.717
The pointed leaves.

30:13.730 --> 30:14.731
What is it?

30:15.232 --> 30:16.859
Lupi spiritus.

30:17.442 --> 30:20.946
Wolvesbreath, Empire.
From our medicinal garden.

30:21.029 --> 30:23.824
It's an analgesic and vasodilator.

30:23.907 --> 30:24.992
Is it poisonous?

30:25.075 --> 30:29.329
No. Wolvesbreath is used in tea
as well as tinctures.

30:29.413 --> 30:32.708
It stimulates the blood vessels,
promotes healing--

30:32.791 --> 30:33.959
Eat it.

30:38.755 --> 30:40.674
If you're not dead
within the next few hours,

30:40.757 --> 30:42.885
have a kilogram of these
sent to my quarters.

30:42.968 --> 30:44.178
Of course, Empire.

30:50.684 --> 30:53.437
Laylo Fulham, get your ass back home
this instant!

30:53.520 --> 30:54.521
Are they gonna get through?

30:54.605 --> 30:55.689
Course not.

30:56.607 --> 31:01.904
Go back to your home, people. Please.
It's not safe out here. Back up. Back up.

31:03.572 --> 31:05.199
You need to come out here. Now.

31:05.282 --> 31:06.366
Kind of busy here, Yate.

31:06.450 --> 31:07.993
I know, and I'm still calling.

31:08.076 --> 31:11.246
We've got Anacreon's troops massing
from the east, west, south,

31:11.330 --> 31:13.081
and presumably the north.

31:14.625 --> 31:16.835
Remember how to hold a rifle, old man?

31:16.919 --> 31:18.003
Barrel goes forward?

31:18.712 --> 31:21.465
We've spotted Anacreons
at multiple locations outside the fence.

31:22.090 --> 31:23.842
-I'll go west.
-We'll head north.

31:24.343 --> 31:26.720
I shouldn't leave.
Lewis is completely overmatched in there.

31:26.803 --> 31:28.263
I'll babysit him, I promise.

31:29.139 --> 31:30.307
All right.

31:31.475 --> 31:34.269
Is it true? You got some kind of
Anacreon chieftain in there?

31:34.353 --> 31:35.604
You been drinking, Muller?

31:35.687 --> 31:38.857
It's the end of the galaxy, isn't it?
Hari's prediction's coming true.

31:38.941 --> 31:41.360
You got hold of a bad rumor, Muller.
Local poacher's all.

31:41.443 --> 31:43.028
They're already here, aren't they?

31:43.904 --> 31:46.365
Hey, why don't you just
take a break for a second.

32:01.004 --> 32:02.005
Hey!

32:02.714 --> 32:03.966
I won't hurt you.

32:07.427 --> 32:08.554
Just tell me who you are.

32:09.471 --> 32:10.639
Sal.

32:11.139 --> 32:12.140
Sal.

32:12.224 --> 32:14.726
Sal. Hey, hey. What's wrong?

32:14.810 --> 32:16.770
I was just in the Imperial Library
on Trantor.

32:16.854 --> 32:19.815
-What do you mean you were there?
-I mean I was there. In the stacks.

32:20.482 --> 32:22.609
The ceiling was wooden,
there were all these marble busts.

32:22.693 --> 32:24.278
And there was a boy with a knife.

32:25.904 --> 32:28.073
It was the same boy who
led me to the Anacreons.

32:29.408 --> 32:33.453
It's the Vault. I can feel it, Hugo.
It's trying to tell me something

32:33.537 --> 32:36.582
about the Anacreons and this crisis.
Everything.

32:36.665 --> 32:40.544
Okay, listen to me. I've always said
you should let this planet shrug you off.

32:41.587 --> 32:46.216
But watching you work, where you could
sense what Phara was feeling inside…

32:47.926 --> 32:48.927
that's special.

32:49.511 --> 32:51.180
Other people can't do that, Sal.

32:51.263 --> 32:52.890
I have absolute faith in you.

32:56.185 --> 32:58.979
I have absolute faith in you.

33:19.291 --> 33:22.044
Who among you
is Master Statistician Tivole?

33:26.048 --> 33:29.134
Empire. May the light never dim.

33:29.218 --> 33:30.761
May the light never dim.

33:30.844 --> 33:33.555
-You received my query.
-I did, Empire.

33:33.639 --> 33:35.807
But I can't say yet we have the results.

33:35.891 --> 33:38.936
How long has it been
since Dusk set you to this task?

33:39.520 --> 33:40.646
Three decades?

33:40.729 --> 33:44.900
What do you do
in your mausoleum of calculus

33:44.983 --> 33:48.278
if not achieve results?

33:50.072 --> 33:53.575
Progress, then. What is your progress?

33:54.743 --> 34:01.041
We believe the-- the predictive models
of Hari Seldon to be counterfactual.

34:03.585 --> 34:05.754
And you believe this why?

34:06.421 --> 34:11.342
In the 35 years since Seldon uttered
his heretical proclamations,

34:11.426 --> 34:15.848
the Imperium has expanded, rather than
contracted, by every critical metric--

34:15.931 --> 34:16.931
Stop.

34:18.183 --> 34:19.560
Seldon's prophecies.

34:19.643 --> 34:24.273
Speak to me of his math,
this "ordinal analysis."

34:24.356 --> 34:27.025
It's a spread of fortune teller's cards

34:27.109 --> 34:31.071
which Seldon chose
to interpret as divination.

34:32.697 --> 34:36.702
The verification he found
in the regression models is unsupported.

34:36.784 --> 34:40.581
But what of these-- these recent events?

34:40.664 --> 34:41.956
The conclave? Luminism?

34:42.040 --> 34:46.920
Baseless conjecture.
Again, vague and unsupported.

34:47.004 --> 34:50.924
I mean, anyone could predict
a return to orthodoxy.

34:51.592 --> 34:56.221
Psychohistory is the fanciful work
of an old man's imagination.

34:56.304 --> 34:58.932
If it weren't the fanciful work
of an old man's imagination, what then?

34:59.016 --> 35:02.978
What is the likelihood that it's all true?
Every prophecy?

35:03.812 --> 35:05.981
Vanishingly small, Empire.

35:06.064 --> 35:07.399
But not zero.

35:09.735 --> 35:10.986
Correct?

35:11.945 --> 35:13.989
Not zero?

35:14.740 --> 35:17.910
What kind of idiots are you?

35:17.993 --> 35:21.163
A thousand imperial mathematicians…

35:21.246 --> 35:24.124
…can't parse the numbers of one man?

35:24.208 --> 35:28.670
So there's nothing
anyone in the galaxy can do?

35:31.256 --> 35:34.885
Is that what it is?
Is that the best you've got?

35:36.762 --> 35:39.681
Tell me. Tell me!

35:41.725 --> 35:44.478
Tell me!

35:55.364 --> 35:57.658
In the twilight of a man's life…

35:57.741 --> 36:00.410
…when his biography is nearly complete,

36:01.036 --> 36:03.580
he grows desperate to know
the measure of his days…

36:05.541 --> 36:09.169
how his voice compares to
the chorus of those who've come before.

36:12.714 --> 36:16.051
Do I matter? Are my choices my own?

36:16.844 --> 36:20.597
Or is my destiny governed by
an unseen hand?

36:32.651 --> 36:34.736
Brother Day. Come to see us off?

36:34.820 --> 36:37.614
I was paid a visit by your statisticians.

36:37.698 --> 36:40.617
It's remarkable
how self-reinforcing their results are.

36:40.701 --> 36:45.080
I think it's best that you stay
and tend to matters on Trantor.

36:45.956 --> 36:49.543
Empire, a primary Cleon has not left
the bosom of Trantor

36:49.626 --> 36:51.753
since the dawn of the Genetic Dynasty.

36:51.837 --> 36:52.838
Demerzel is right.

36:53.714 --> 36:56.508
We have these protocols in place
for a reason.

36:56.592 --> 37:03.182
And I say our protocols have
made us complacent.

37:03.891 --> 37:05.976
When you sat on the middle throne,
as I do now,

37:06.059 --> 37:08.478
and were debating what to do about
Anacreon and Thespis,

37:08.562 --> 37:11.773
what our response should be,
do you remember what you said?

37:13.233 --> 37:14.234
I do.

37:15.319 --> 37:16.695
Like it was yesterday.

37:17.279 --> 37:18.530
I was seven.

37:18.614 --> 37:21.700
Our eldest brother had argued
for a bout of grace.

37:21.783 --> 37:24.536
You turned to me and said,
"What do you think, Ascending Dawn?"

37:25.829 --> 37:27.331
I knew you were against grace,

37:27.956 --> 37:30.876
that you wanted to bomb
the barbarian kingdoms.

37:30.959 --> 37:35.130
But I was scared. And I dared say so.

37:35.964 --> 37:38.383
Well, I'm not scared anymore.

37:39.218 --> 37:45.098
On your watch, the Star Bridge fell.
And from that scar insurgency was birthed.

37:45.182 --> 37:47.601
On your watch, two worlds were incinerated

37:47.684 --> 37:50.229
with not a care to
innocence or consequence.

37:50.312 --> 37:53.732
On your watch, Hari Seldon
and his followers were allowed to flee.

37:54.274 --> 37:57.694
You have bequeathed me
an Empire rent by impulsive action.

37:57.778 --> 38:01.698
The same will not be said of me.
Not on my watch.

38:02.282 --> 38:04.701
I would save our legacy.

38:04.785 --> 38:05.786
Brother…

38:07.120 --> 38:11.375
you are haunted by
the ghost of a man long dead.

38:11.458 --> 38:13.710
We all are, Brother.

38:18.340 --> 38:20.092
Your watch is over.

38:21.552 --> 38:25.889
You will stay on Trantor, tending to
the wounds you have allowed to fester.

38:27.140 --> 38:28.141
Go.

38:29.059 --> 38:31.520
Return Brother Dusk's belongings
to the palace.

38:42.739 --> 38:46.660
Certainly now the Empire will
no longer be rent by impulsive action.

39:18.859 --> 39:19.985
You summoned me, Empire?

39:20.068 --> 39:22.779
A communications buoy has gone dark
in the Outer Reach.

39:24.114 --> 39:25.574
Take your team and investigate.

39:26.408 --> 39:27.618
At once, Empire.

39:28.118 --> 39:29.119
Dorwin.

39:30.037 --> 39:32.706
Our dispatches from the Foundation
have become sporadic.

39:32.789 --> 39:33.874
Pay them a visit.

39:33.957 --> 39:37.836
And remind the Foundation
that Empire will not be kept in the dark.

40:41.984 --> 40:44.236
-Is that, uh--
-Doesn't look good, does it?

41:03.130 --> 41:07.134
Who is in charge here, Lewis? You?
Or is it the Warden with the coin tricks?

41:07.217 --> 41:09.553
Because it seems
she's managed to complicate matters.

41:09.636 --> 41:11.972
-Let me be clear, Huntress Keaen--
-Grand Huntress.

41:12.055 --> 41:13.599
The only reason we have a crisis

41:13.682 --> 41:17.144
is because you trespassed
on the Emperor's personal domain.

41:17.227 --> 41:20.439
If only Salvor had taken me to the tower
and given me what I'd wanted,

41:20.522 --> 41:22.149
we'd already be off-planet.

41:22.232 --> 41:23.734
The module from our slow ship?

41:23.817 --> 41:26.320
It's not as if
your people have any use for it.

41:26.820 --> 41:30.407
You're marooned on Terminus.
The Empire made sure of that.

41:30.490 --> 41:31.825
Lewis.

41:32.743 --> 41:33.744
Why do you need it?

41:34.244 --> 41:36.455
My people are technologically bankrupt.

41:36.538 --> 41:38.165
We're dying, Director.

41:38.957 --> 41:42.461
We have been ever since the Empire
set our atmosphere on fire.

41:42.544 --> 41:46.381
Half our population lost
for a crime that we were innocent of.

41:46.465 --> 41:48.300
Unlike you, we have ships.

41:48.383 --> 41:51.970
We can leave our poisoned world,
find another star system.

41:52.054 --> 41:55.224
If only we had
the means to navigate the void.

41:55.307 --> 41:57.017
The Empire would crush us
for assisting you.

41:57.100 --> 41:58.852
We're forcing your hand, Director.

41:59.853 --> 42:01.730
Because we have nothing left to lose.

42:02.689 --> 42:05.901
You can't play chess with someone
who's willing to set the board on fire.

42:09.905 --> 42:11.949
Is that some kind of flak cannon?

42:12.032 --> 42:14.618
Wasting their time if they think
that's gonna penetrate the fence.

42:14.701 --> 42:18.163
None of this feels right.
Phara is smarter than this.

42:18.247 --> 42:20.666
They took out the comms buoy,
and they came in prepared.

42:20.749 --> 42:23.418
There's a larger strategy here,
and I am missing it somehow.

42:23.502 --> 42:25.754
What if I take my ship,
make a run for the stars, get help?

42:25.838 --> 42:29.216
No, no. They'd shoot you out of the sky
before you ever made it into orbit.

42:30.259 --> 42:32.010
Regretting you didn't bug out
when you had the chance?

42:32.094 --> 42:34.763
Done a lot of foolish things in my life,
Salvor Hardin.

42:34.847 --> 42:36.682
Sticking by your side is not one of them.

42:38.016 --> 42:39.434
Best manservant ever.

42:50.737 --> 42:52.281
The Vault isn't Anacreon…

42:53.156 --> 42:54.199
or alien at all.

42:54.283 --> 42:55.742
It's gotta be connected to Hari.

42:55.826 --> 42:56.827
How do you know that?

42:56.910 --> 42:58.787
Because the vision I saw
when I blacked out,

42:59.413 --> 43:04.042
it was on Trantor in Hari's library,
with a boy holding a knife on me.

43:04.835 --> 43:06.503
What if it was a warning to stay away?

43:07.754 --> 43:09.256
What if Lewis is right?

43:09.339 --> 43:12.467
I'm an outlier, just like he says,
barging around, knocking things over,

43:12.551 --> 43:13.844
screwing up Seldon's plan?

43:13.927 --> 43:16.430
Salvor, what if you are Seldon's plan?

43:18.682 --> 43:22.394
The fate of one individual
will always remain a mystery.

43:22.477 --> 43:26.857
Remember my promise, Warden?
Razing your city to the ground?

43:26.940 --> 43:28.901
But the movements of masses,

43:28.984 --> 43:32.529
the rise and falls of cultures,
causes and worlds…

43:33.363 --> 43:36.533
These were answers
Hari Seldon had long since unriddled.

43:37.201 --> 43:38.493
It's time.

43:38.577 --> 43:42.372
And the beginning of the end,
as befitting its name,

43:42.456 --> 43:44.249
took place on Terminus.
