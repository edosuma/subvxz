WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:04.669
(bright orchestral theme
playing)

00:54.353 --> 00:56.287
Step right up!
Step right up!

00:56.289 --> 00:57.255
You won't believe your eyes!

00:57.257 --> 01:01.426
Step right up and see the
amazing half man, half clam!

01:01.428 --> 01:01.893
What a rip-off.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.863
It's just Kim Cattrall
sitting Indian-style.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.833
Boy, they've got some
very unusual prizes

01:08.835 --> 01:10.835
at the carnival this year.

01:11.470 --> 01:12.370
A winner!

01:12.372 --> 01:13.438
Congratulations, son.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.041
You've won a genuine
live homosexual!

01:16.043 --> 01:17.475
Ooh, where are we going?!

01:17.477 --> 01:18.810
Wait, don't tell me.

01:18.812 --> 01:20.478
Oh, boy!
Mom, can I keep him?

01:20.480 --> 01:22.047
Well, it's a big
responsibility, Chris.

01:22.049 --> 01:25.850
That means you'll have
to clean up after
him and feed him.

01:25.852 --> 01:27.018
What do you eat?

01:27.020 --> 01:27.952
Attention.

01:27.954 --> 01:29.921
I like your hair.
Still hungry.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.891
You have a beautiful
speaking voice.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.292
I'm full.

01:34.294 --> 01:35.493
Let's see.

01:35.495 --> 01:38.763
I guess 185 pounds.

01:39.165 --> 01:42.400
Wrong.
I'm 95% helium.

01:44.570 --> 01:45.837
Brian, look what I won!

01:45.839 --> 01:47.305
Wow, what'd
you win that for?

01:47.307 --> 01:49.374
For having the best pig
in the competition.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.242
Wait, you bred a pig?
Sure did.

01:51.244 --> 01:53.578
Most genetically-perfect
one in the contest.

01:53.580 --> 01:54.479
Oink.

01:54.481 --> 01:55.246
Oh, my God!

01:55.248 --> 01:57.148
Yes, he's something,
isn't he?

01:57.150 --> 01:57.949
Are those fists?

01:57.951 --> 02:00.785
Damn right.
Show him, pig.

02:01.053 --> 02:02.353
How the hell did you do this?

02:02.355 --> 02:04.155
I'll let you in on
a little secret, Brian.

02:04.157 --> 02:06.257
I didn't do it.
I got it from a farm.

02:06.259 --> 02:08.526
What the hell kind of farm
breeds pigs like this?

02:08.528 --> 02:10.929
Would you like to see it
for yourself, Brian?

02:10.931 --> 02:11.529
Yeah, I would.

02:11.531 --> 02:13.031
Good, 'cause it's gonna
blow your mind

02:13.033 --> 02:16.568
like the stereopticon did
to Americans in 1910.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.136
Hey, I'm in New York City!

02:18.138 --> 02:19.370
No, I'm not!
Yes, I am!

02:19.372 --> 02:20.972
No, I'm not! Yes, I am!

02:20.974 --> 02:23.241
What's going on here?!

02:28.848 --> 02:30.615
(beeping)

02:32.852 --> 02:34.119
This is it, Brian.

02:34.121 --> 02:35.053
What's that?

02:35.055 --> 02:36.020
It's how I got the pig.

02:36.022 --> 02:38.289
You ever heard
of the multiverse
theory, Brian?

02:38.291 --> 02:39.124
Well, of course I have,

02:39.126 --> 02:40.492
but I'm wondering
if you have.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.861
Oh, my God.
So transparent.

02:42.863 --> 02:43.561
Well, the theory states

02:43.563 --> 02:45.463
that there are
an infinite number of universes

02:45.465 --> 02:48.333
coexisting with ours
on parallel dimensional planes.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.400
Dimensional
planes, right.

02:49.402 --> 02:50.301
Don't, don't do that.

02:50.303 --> 02:51.903
Don't, don't repeat
the last two words

02:51.905 --> 02:54.172
like you already kinda knew
what I was talkin' about.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.673
You have no idea
what I'm talkin' about.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.675
Now in each of these
alternate universes,

02:57.677 --> 02:59.477
the reality is different
than our own.

02:59.479 --> 03:02.147
Sometimes only slightly,
sometimes quite radically.

03:02.149 --> 03:05.416
The point is, every possible
eventuality exists.

03:05.418 --> 03:07.452
And that's where
you got the pig,

03:07.454 --> 03:08.453
in a parallel universe.

03:08.455 --> 03:11.289
Prepare yourself, Brian,
and I'll show you.

03:11.291 --> 03:13.258
(beeping)

03:25.371 --> 03:26.070
Where are we?

03:26.072 --> 03:29.140
This is Quahog, Brian.
Same year, same time.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.008
But in this universe,

03:30.010 --> 03:33.011
Christianity never existed,
which means the Dark Ages

03:33.013 --> 03:35.046
of scientific repression
never occurred, and thus,

03:35.048 --> 03:37.348
humanity is a thousand years
more advanced.

03:37.350 --> 03:40.585
Ergo, muscular,
genetically perfect pigs.

03:40.587 --> 03:41.753
Hey, look,
there's Quagmire.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.955
Thanks, honey.
Say hi to your husband.

03:43.957 --> 03:44.923
(device beeping)

03:44.925 --> 03:45.657
Oh, I got AIDS again.

03:45.659 --> 03:49.494
Better take my
"NyQuil Cold, Flu, and AIDS."

03:50.429 --> 03:50.929
All gone.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.764
What time do you
suppose it is, Brian?

03:52.766 --> 03:54.465
I don't know,
about 3:30.

03:54.467 --> 03:57.035
Watch the sidewalk.

03:58.571 --> 04:01.506
♪ Drop dead legs

04:01.508 --> 04:03.575
♪ Pretty smile

04:03.577 --> 04:06.110
♪ Hurts my head

04:06.112 --> 04:07.445
♪ Gets me wild

04:07.447 --> 04:10.114
♪ Dig that steam...

04:10.116 --> 04:12.483
My God,
is that... Meg?!

04:12.485 --> 04:13.384
36D, Brian.

04:13.386 --> 04:15.386
And you know
what's amazing?

04:15.388 --> 04:16.087
In this universe,

04:16.089 --> 04:18.122
she's still one
of the ugly ones.

04:18.124 --> 04:18.590
If you saw Lois,

04:18.592 --> 04:21.125
you'd have to put your penis
in a wheelchair.

04:21.127 --> 04:23.895
Come on.
I'll show you around.

04:24.163 --> 04:25.563
Hey, is there a
bathroom around here?

04:25.565 --> 04:27.198
Oh, you need
to go pee or poop?

04:27.200 --> 04:28.566
Poop.
One poop removal.

04:28.568 --> 04:29.634
(electronic twittering)

04:29.636 --> 04:31.402
Wow, did I just go poop?

04:31.404 --> 04:33.571
You sure did.
All digital.

04:33.573 --> 04:34.205
Where does it go?

04:34.207 --> 04:36.007
It gets beamed
to another dimension.

04:36.009 --> 04:36.741
Let me ask you this:

04:36.743 --> 04:40.011
what about all the
Renaissance art that
Christianity inspired?

04:40.013 --> 04:41.980
That was
my first question, too.

04:41.982 --> 04:44.582
Come on, have a look
at the Sistine Chapel.

04:50.623 --> 04:51.256
Wow.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.324
Yeah, with no Christianity
to inspire Michelangelo,

04:53.326 --> 04:55.593
they gave the job
to John Hinckley.

04:58.230 --> 05:00.164
All right, you ready
to go home now?

05:00.166 --> 05:01.933
Are you kidding?
This is amazing.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.201
Can we see
more universes?

05:03.203 --> 05:04.969
Hmm, well, I haven't
tried yet,

05:04.971 --> 05:08.106
but I don't see why not.

05:10.142 --> 05:11.476
Whoa, what's this place?

05:11.478 --> 05:13.111
Yeah, this universe
looks weird.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.380
Yeah, it's cheap
and somehow lazy.

05:15.382 --> 05:17.916
PETER:
Yabba-dabba... (giggles)

05:21.887 --> 05:22.453
RockPeter?

05:22.455 --> 05:23.922
(audience laughter
on laugh track)

05:23.924 --> 05:24.355
Yes, RockLois?

05:24.357 --> 05:28.192
That was wonderful rock sex
we had last rock night.

05:28.194 --> 05:28.526
(laughter)

05:28.528 --> 05:32.297
Yes, I enjoyed rocking you up
the rock last night.

05:32.299 --> 05:32.764
(laughter)

05:32.766 --> 05:35.934
I know. I'm glad you wore
that rock ring.

05:35.936 --> 05:36.467
(laughter)

05:36.469 --> 05:38.569
But we still always use
a rockphylactic.

05:38.571 --> 05:42.407
I'm ribbited for your pleasure.

05:46.946 --> 05:49.714
Hey, Brian, want to get
the rock out of here?

05:49.716 --> 05:51.549
Rock yeah.

05:53.786 --> 05:55.753
Huh, this looks like
Spooner Street,

05:55.755 --> 05:58.256
only something's
not quite right.

05:58.891 --> 06:00.224
According
to the multiverse guide,

06:00.226 --> 06:02.160
this is a universe
where the United States

06:02.162 --> 06:04.629
never dropped
the atomic bomb on Hiroshima,

06:04.631 --> 06:07.231
so the Japanese
just never quit.

06:17.443 --> 06:18.910
(farts)

06:46.905 --> 06:48.172
(giggles)

06:48.174 --> 06:49.540
Well, I think
I've seen enough.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.309
Let's get back
to our universe.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.644
All right, off we go.

06:54.780 --> 06:57.281
Ah, home, sweet home.

06:57.483 --> 06:59.384
LOIS (happy):
Peter?

06:59.386 --> 07:00.385
(sad):
Peter?

07:00.387 --> 07:01.386
(happy):
What?

07:01.388 --> 07:02.987
(sad):
What?

07:03.255 --> 07:04.489
(happy):
Can you take out
the trash?

07:04.491 --> 07:07.225
(sad):
'Cause it stinks
in the kitchen.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.160
(happy):
Sure thing, Lois, delighted to.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.896
(sad): I get tired
when I stand.

07:11.898 --> 07:12.864
(both gasp)

07:12.866 --> 07:14.165
What the hell is this?

07:14.167 --> 07:15.099
This isn't our universe.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.334
Apparently, this is
a universe

07:16.336 --> 07:20.138
where everyone has two heads:
one happy, one sad.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.873
Honey, have you
seen Stewie?

07:21.875 --> 07:24.208
I can't find
him anywhere.

07:24.210 --> 07:25.309
I sure have!

07:25.311 --> 07:28.980
He's over there,
playing in the corner.

07:30.182 --> 07:32.116
(happy): I want you
to know I love you.

07:32.118 --> 07:35.319
(sad): I'm trying to get
excited about it.

07:35.321 --> 07:36.220
Oh, this is too freaky.

07:36.222 --> 07:37.822
Why didn't that
thing take us home?

07:37.824 --> 07:39.190
I don't know.
I told you,

07:39.192 --> 07:40.491
it hasn't been
fully tested yet.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.260
Well, we can't stay here.
That's for sure.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.662
(happy):
And now back to Channel 5 News
at 6:00.

07:44.664 --> 07:48.766
(sad):
Quahog's lowest-rated newscast.

07:48.768 --> 07:50.768
The president's dog
just had puppies!

07:50.770 --> 07:53.404
There was a plane crash.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.873
Stewie, please tell me
you know how to get us home.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.810
Of course I know
how to get us home.

08:00.279 --> 08:02.447
What the hell?
Stewie, what's going on?

08:02.449 --> 08:03.347
Well, from the look of it,

08:03.349 --> 08:06.417
I'm guessing this is Quahog,
but during some sort of ice age.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.352
Well, press the button.
Get us outta here.

08:08.354 --> 08:10.655
Uh-oh, I can't reach
the device.

08:10.657 --> 08:11.889
What?
You're kidding.

08:11.891 --> 08:12.590
Yeah, get comfortable.

08:12.592 --> 08:14.759
I think we're gonna be here
for a while.

08:14.761 --> 08:18.329
Oh, look, there's your poop
from the other universe.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.633
Stewie, you gotta
get us out of here!

08:22.635 --> 08:24.035
If we stay in here
much longer,

08:24.037 --> 08:25.403
we're either gonna
freeze or starve!

08:25.405 --> 08:27.405
I know, but I can't reach
the device.

08:27.407 --> 08:28.539
You try.
You're closer to it,

08:28.541 --> 08:30.708
and besides,
you're stronger than I am.

08:30.710 --> 08:31.542
Hey, what was that?

08:31.544 --> 08:33.544
Oh, well, you said
I was stronger than you,

08:33.546 --> 08:34.979
and that must have
made me happy.

08:34.981 --> 08:36.180
So my tail
started wagging.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.382
Looks like it carved
through the ice a bit.

08:38.384 --> 08:39.450
Yeah, it did.
Keep going.

08:39.452 --> 08:40.585
Okay, uh, let's see, um...

08:40.587 --> 08:42.019
you want to go
for a walk?

08:42.021 --> 08:42.720
It's working!
Do more!

08:42.722 --> 08:44.856
Uh, you want a treat?!
You want a treat, boy?!

08:44.858 --> 08:45.890
That's good,
that's good, but you...

08:45.892 --> 08:47.758
you really have
one, right?!
Oh, yeah, yeah.

08:47.760 --> 08:48.759
And we're going
for that walk?!

08:48.761 --> 08:51.596
Oh, yeah, definitely.
And, um, I'll, I'll
give you a bath!

08:51.598 --> 08:52.463
No, no, no!
Oh, sorry, sorry.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.932
And, and I'll,
I'll let you go
for a ride in the car!

08:54.934 --> 08:55.867
Oh, you better
not be lying!

08:55.869 --> 08:57.502
You want to sleep
in the bed with us?!

08:57.504 --> 08:58.469
Yes! Oh, I never get to!

08:58.471 --> 08:59.470
It must be a
special occasion!

08:59.472 --> 09:00.605
You got it!
You're through!

09:00.607 --> 09:02.206
Yes! All right,
what do I do?

09:02.208 --> 09:03.274
Just press
the red button!

09:03.276 --> 09:04.609
Okay.
Uh, which one's red?

09:04.611 --> 09:06.511
Press the big button!

09:08.347 --> 09:10.748
This can't be it.
This doesn't
look familiar.

09:10.750 --> 09:11.649
You're right, Brian.

09:11.651 --> 09:12.517
Apparently, this is
a universe

09:12.519 --> 09:16.320
where everyone has
to take a poop
right just now.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.856
Okay, uh, Bill, you got
those numbers?
Yeah, yeah.

09:18.858 --> 09:20.191
Okay, just leave
them on my desk.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.058
Okay, that works out
fine for me.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.327
Where's your desk?
Doug knows
where my desk is.

09:23.329 --> 09:24.128
Craig, are you
good with this?

09:24.130 --> 09:27.231
Yeah, that should work out
pretty good for me, too.

09:30.802 --> 09:32.570
What the hell?
What's happened to us?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.472
I don't know,
but suddenly I feel

09:34.474 --> 09:36.474
all sweet and warm
and fuzzy.

09:36.476 --> 09:37.775
It seems we're in a universe

09:37.777 --> 09:39.911
where everything is drawn
by Disney.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.246
Look, there's
our house.

09:43.515 --> 09:45.416
(laughing)

09:45.418 --> 09:47.852
Look how
gaily we run!

09:51.490 --> 09:55.493
Oh, Stewie and Brian,
you're just in time for pie.

09:55.495 --> 09:58.796
PETER:
Did somebody say "pie"?

10:00.432 --> 10:03.334
(bright orchestral
intro plays)

10:03.336 --> 10:06.571
♪ It's a wonderful day for pie ♪

10:06.573 --> 10:09.840
♪ You can ask all the birds
in the sky ♪

10:09.842 --> 10:13.611
♪ And they'll tell you real
sweet with a musical tweet ♪

10:13.613 --> 10:18.082
(Quagmire's voice):
♪ It's a wonderful day
for pie ♪

10:18.084 --> 10:19.917
♪ For pie

10:19.919 --> 10:21.719
♪ For pie

10:21.721 --> 10:23.387
♪ For pie

10:23.389 --> 10:25.122
♪ For pie!

10:25.124 --> 10:26.624
This is wonderful, Brian.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.059
Oh, let's live in this universe.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.394
Gosh, it's pretty
intoxicating, isn't it?

10:30.396 --> 10:33.631
I want to hear
more music about pie.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.667
♪ It's a wonderful day for pie ♪

10:36.669 --> 10:40.338
(Cleveland's voice):
♪ And it smells
a lot better than I ♪

♪ It's a wonderful,
wonderful day for pie! ♪

11:00.826 --> 11:05.496
(Herbert's voice):
You want a nice, shiny red apple
to put in that pie?

11:05.498 --> 11:06.964
ALL:
No!

11:09.901 --> 11:12.503
Brian, we could spend
the rest of our lives here.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.138
It's perfect.
Sounds good to me.

11:14.140 --> 11:16.741
Doesn't seem to be a thing
wrong with this place.

11:16.743 --> 11:18.542
Hello, everybody.

11:18.544 --> 11:21.245
ALL:
Jew!

11:25.617 --> 11:28.552
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
This is a Disney universe.

11:28.554 --> 11:30.554
Oh, but look at how shiny
my buttons are here.

11:30.556 --> 11:32.290
Just push the...
Yeah, yeah,
okay, okay.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.859
I'll push the thing.

11:34.861 --> 11:38.462
(bright melody plays)

11:40.699 --> 11:41.766
Whoa, this is trippy.

11:41.768 --> 11:44.735
I should say so. We're in
the Robot Chicken universe.

11:44.737 --> 11:46.804
Will you guys move?
You're blocking the TV.

11:46.806 --> 11:50.574
Look! GI Joe, Transformers,
Thundercats, He-Man!

11:50.576 --> 11:52.143
Yay! Those shows existed!

11:52.145 --> 11:55.513
How's it feel to be on a major
network for 30 seconds?

11:55.515 --> 11:56.781
(bleep) you!

11:56.783 --> 11:58.749
Bye.

12:00.152 --> 12:02.053
My God. This place
looks terrible.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.055
Looks like Quahog
was vaporized or something.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.924
It says that in this universe,
Frank Sinatra was never born,

12:06.926 --> 12:09.593
and therefore, he was unable
to use his influence

12:09.595 --> 12:10.695
to get Kennedy elected.

12:10.697 --> 12:12.263
So, Nixon won
the 1960 election

12:12.265 --> 12:14.799
and totally botched the
Cuban Missile Crisis,

12:14.801 --> 12:15.599
causing World War III.

12:15.601 --> 12:18.536
Wow, so I guess Lee Harvey
Oswald never shot Kennedy?

12:18.538 --> 12:20.805
No, He shot Mayor McCheese.

12:23.342 --> 12:24.642
(shots firing)

12:24.644 --> 12:27.411
(crowd screaming)

12:27.413 --> 12:29.146
That joke's
not in bad taste, right?

12:29.148 --> 12:32.650
Oh, who cares?
He's a cheeseburger.

12:34.319 --> 12:35.119
Ew. Where are we?

12:35.121 --> 12:37.455
I don't know. The device can't
make heads or tails of it.

12:37.457 --> 12:42.059
It's just some sort of weird,
low-resolution blocky universe.

12:42.061 --> 12:43.728
Lois, where is my supper?

12:43.730 --> 12:44.595
Still in the oven.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.163
Will I have it soon?
Quite soon.

12:46.165 --> 12:47.898
Thank you!
You're welcome!

12:47.900 --> 12:48.933
Nyah!
Nyah!

12:48.935 --> 12:50.000
Nyah!
Nyah!

12:50.002 --> 12:51.035
Nyah!
Nyah!

12:51.037 --> 12:51.836
Nyah!
Nyah!

12:51.838 --> 12:54.739
I'm frightened.
Let's go.

12:55.807 --> 12:57.441
Love it.
Hate it.

12:58.543 --> 13:00.444
Love it.
Hate it.

13:02.013 --> 13:03.814
Uh, Brian?
Yeah?

13:03.816 --> 13:04.849
This feels weird.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.817
Hit the button.

13:07.719 --> 13:08.953
Oh, God, what is this?

13:08.955 --> 13:10.254
I feel like I'm on acid
or something.

13:10.256 --> 13:12.990
According to the Multiverse
Guide, this is a universe

13:12.992 --> 13:14.058
where everything is depicted

13:14.060 --> 13:16.861
as a <i>Washington Post</i>
<i>political cartoon.</i>

13:16.863 --> 13:18.162
Good Lord, I'm naked.

13:18.164 --> 13:20.164
And why am I holding
a dinner platter

13:20.166 --> 13:21.999
that says McCain/Feingold?

13:22.001 --> 13:23.634
(laughing)

13:23.636 --> 13:25.202
That's-That's pretty good.

13:25.204 --> 13:26.804
That's-That's funny.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.072
You don't get it.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.774
No, no, I totally get it.

13:29.776 --> 13:31.208
Oh, God.
Let's go, quick.

13:31.210 --> 13:34.078
Here comes an overweight cat
with dollar signs for eyes

13:34.080 --> 13:35.813
and a hat that says
"Social Security,"

13:35.815 --> 13:38.516
pouring a bucket that says
"Alternative minimum tax"

13:38.518 --> 13:41.919
over a sad Statue of Liberty
holding a democracy umbrella.

13:41.921 --> 13:43.220
(laughing):
Yes!

13:43.222 --> 13:46.791
Oh, that ought
to wake people up.

13:46.793 --> 13:50.227
Shut the (bleep) up.

13:51.329 --> 13:53.364
Oh, my God.
Now we're nowhere.

13:53.366 --> 13:53.998
Not quite, Brian.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.133
This is a universe,
but its only inhabitant

13:56.135 --> 13:59.770
is one really faraway guy
who yells compliments.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.238
I like your shirt!

14:01.240 --> 14:02.840
Thank you!

14:02.842 --> 14:04.942
This was nice.

14:06.578 --> 14:07.611
We did it. We're back.

14:07.613 --> 14:11.782
No. This is the universe
of misleading portraiture.

14:11.784 --> 14:12.249
Aw.

14:12.251 --> 14:15.986
Oh, wait. It's not so bad.
There's the compliment guy.

14:15.988 --> 14:17.188
Hello!

14:17.190 --> 14:21.525
(groans)
They got both of us!

14:22.160 --> 14:24.061
We're finished. We're
never going to get home.

14:24.063 --> 14:26.163
We're never going to
see our Peter and Lois

14:26.165 --> 14:28.966
or anyone else
we know ever again.

14:28.968 --> 14:29.800
You got your pal Stewie.

14:29.802 --> 14:33.270
Great.
Aw, you could learn
something from Compliment Guy.

14:33.272 --> 14:35.239
And you know,
it's not as bad as you think.

14:35.241 --> 14:37.541
I may have
finally figured this out.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.644
I just need to make
a few more calculations...

14:53.358 --> 14:54.091
Whoa.

14:54.093 --> 14:56.760
Sorry about that.
Bad girl, Holly.

14:56.762 --> 14:57.695
No jumpies.

14:57.697 --> 14:58.929
Oh, it's quite all right.

14:58.931 --> 15:02.766
Um, wow.
Okay, this is ridiculous.

15:02.768 --> 15:06.136
You go here.
You, you naughty little wire,

15:06.138 --> 15:07.605
you're supposed to be over here.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.206
How did you get over there?

15:09.208 --> 15:10.875
Oh, yeah.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.343
Come on, Holly.
Let's go.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.912
This guy's a freak.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.614
And that should do it.

15:16.616 --> 15:17.615
Now, let's go home.

15:17.617 --> 15:18.849
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

15:18.851 --> 15:20.951
I just don't think we
should be too hasty.

15:20.953 --> 15:22.419
I mean, we have a
unique opportunity

15:22.421 --> 15:24.788
to study alternate
universes in depth.

15:24.790 --> 15:26.257
Brian,
give me the damn device.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.424
Give it.
(groaning)

15:27.426 --> 15:28.459
No, knock it off.
Give it.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.294
No, stop it. Stop it.
Come on, give it.

15:30.296 --> 15:31.629
No. Come on.
Come on.

15:31.631 --> 15:32.796
(clattering, crashing)

15:32.798 --> 15:33.898
What the hell, man?

15:33.900 --> 15:35.232
What the hell?
Look what you did!

15:35.234 --> 15:37.001
You better put that
thing on a leash, sir,

15:37.003 --> 15:39.970
or I'm going to
have to fine you.

15:39.972 --> 15:45.142
Take your stinkin' paws off me,
you damn dirty dog.

15:47.913 --> 15:50.180
What the hell
were you thinking, Brian?

15:50.182 --> 15:51.749
We're never going
to get home now.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.817
Why the hell would you
break the damn device?

15:53.819 --> 15:55.352
Look, it was an
accident, all right?

15:55.354 --> 15:57.688
And besides,
look at this place.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.323
It's a world run by dogs.

15:59.325 --> 16:02.192
I mean, I kind of want
to explore this universe.

16:02.194 --> 16:03.827
Oh, you like role reversal?

16:03.829 --> 16:04.428
Huh? Okay.

16:04.430 --> 16:08.065
Wait, what are you doing?
Oh! Oh! Come on!

16:08.067 --> 16:10.768
Pick up my poop!
Pick up my poop!

16:10.770 --> 16:12.236
I'm not picking
up your poop!

16:12.238 --> 16:13.337
Hey, you.
Pick up that poop.

16:13.339 --> 16:16.540
You heard him, Brian.
Pick up my poop.

16:17.909 --> 16:20.611
Go on. Pick it up.
Do it. Pick up my poop!

16:20.613 --> 16:21.845
I need a plastic bag.

16:21.847 --> 16:23.914
Here's a thin napkin.

16:25.750 --> 16:29.219
Okay, I'm a new neighbor and
you're my pet human Hotchkiss.

16:29.221 --> 16:30.421
Got it?
I-I-I don't...

16:30.423 --> 16:32.423
I'm not so crazy
about "Hotchkiss" anymore.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.725
What do you mean? You
came up with Hotchkiss.

16:34.727 --> 16:35.326
I know, but...

16:35.328 --> 16:39.196
How about Axel or-or-or
Maximilian or Dex, you know?

16:39.198 --> 16:41.398
It's-It's got to have
an "X" in it because...

16:41.400 --> 16:42.866
'cause that means
I have cool parents

16:42.868 --> 16:45.970
who take me on expensive
ski trips on spring break

16:45.972 --> 16:47.705
and I get
to drink wine with dinner,

16:47.707 --> 16:49.773
even though
I'm only 14, and...

16:49.775 --> 16:50.941
(rings doorbell)

16:50.943 --> 16:51.976
Oh, my God! I know that sound!

16:51.978 --> 16:53.410
That means there's a potential
intruder at the front door

16:53.412 --> 16:55.379
or one of my pals.
Either way, I'm really excited

16:55.381 --> 16:57.781
and ready for
anything! Hello?

16:57.783 --> 16:58.716
(chuckles)

16:58.718 --> 17:00.317
Hello, my name
is Blake Carrington.

17:00.319 --> 17:03.020
Aw.
And this is
my human, Gabe.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.088
Oh, no. What?

17:04.090 --> 17:05.022
We just moved in
down the street

17:05.024 --> 17:07.324
and thought we'd stop in
and say hi to our new neighbors.

17:07.326 --> 17:10.861
Well, great to meet you.
Come on in. I'm Peter.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.330
This is my family.
My wife Lois.

17:13.431 --> 17:15.766
My son, Chris-- Chris,
stop licking yourself

17:15.768 --> 17:18.102
and come up and say hi!

17:18.104 --> 17:20.270
My daughter Meg.

17:20.272 --> 17:22.072
Our puppy Stewie.

17:22.074 --> 17:24.041
And this is
our human Brian.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.776
Nice to meet you.

17:25.778 --> 17:28.145
"Say hi
to human Brian, Blake,"

17:28.147 --> 17:29.546
says Gabe.
Hi.

17:29.548 --> 17:32.149
Mommy, I want to play
with the new human.

17:32.151 --> 17:33.984
Only if it's okay
with Blake.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.486
Uh, yeah, sure,
it's fine.

17:35.488 --> 17:36.387
Gabe is great with puppies.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.423
I swear to God, I hope
the next universe we go to

17:39.425 --> 17:42.793
is all Koreans.

17:44.763 --> 17:46.397
I know who you are, Stewie.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.164
I beg your pardon?

17:47.166 --> 17:49.800
I've perfected
multiverse travel, as well.

17:49.802 --> 17:50.901
In fact, I've figured out

17:50.903 --> 17:53.270
how to navigate
with absolute precision.

17:53.272 --> 17:54.304
Really?
I haven't.

17:54.306 --> 17:57.174
We've been jumping randomly
from one universe to the next.

17:57.176 --> 17:59.777
Did you have
the "shuffle" button on?

17:59.779 --> 18:01.945
Oh, my God.
There you go.

18:01.947 --> 18:02.946
That's why that
little symbol...

18:02.948 --> 18:04.415
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
The two
crossed arrows...

18:04.417 --> 18:05.549
There it is.
...is up there
in the corner.

18:05.551 --> 18:07.584
There's your problem.
Oh, my God. I feel silly.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.219
But I can't do
anything about it.

18:09.221 --> 18:10.320
My device has
been destroyed.

18:10.322 --> 18:13.290
Well, I've got one of my own.
I can use it to send you back.

18:13.292 --> 18:14.792
Hold on, I'll get it.

18:14.794 --> 18:15.993
(doorbell rings)

18:15.995 --> 18:17.327
Oh, my God! Who is it? I got it!

18:17.329 --> 18:18.896
Morning, Peter.
Hey, Joe.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.731
Bonnie and I
are having company tonight,

18:20.733 --> 18:22.966
wondering if I could
borrow some wet food.

18:22.968 --> 18:23.567
Yeah, sure thing.

18:23.569 --> 18:25.869
That's Joe.
He's our local human catcher.

18:25.871 --> 18:30.574
So don't misbehave or the human
catcher'll come after you...

18:30.576 --> 18:31.542
Gabe.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.277
My name's not Gabe!
(growls)

18:33.279 --> 18:34.912
Ow!
(screams)

18:34.914 --> 18:36.980
Oh, you're in big trouble,
you little crap!

18:36.982 --> 18:38.882
Boy, you shouldn't have
done that, little fella.

18:38.884 --> 18:41.819
You just earned yourself
a trip to the pound!

18:41.821 --> 18:43.153
(muffled screams)

18:43.155 --> 18:44.088
(screams)

18:44.090 --> 18:45.856
Who the hell
do you think you are?!

18:45.858 --> 18:47.024
Brian! Brian!

18:47.026 --> 18:47.958
Do something!

18:47.960 --> 18:49.026
Look, I'm sorry about this.

18:49.028 --> 18:50.294
Let me just pay the fine
or whatever

18:50.296 --> 18:52.329
and I'll make sure
this doesn't happen again.

18:52.331 --> 18:54.064
You can pick
him up tomorrow.

18:54.066 --> 18:54.932
Oh. Okay.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.700
Just bring a trash bag.

18:56.702 --> 18:57.835
(wheels squeaking)

18:57.837 --> 18:58.902
What did he mean by that?

18:58.904 --> 19:01.004
Any human that bites
a dog gets euthanized.

19:01.006 --> 19:02.039
You know that.
No, he doesn't!

19:02.041 --> 19:05.309
He's from another universe where
dogs are subservient to humans.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.577
Oh, you mean like
that time we...
Yeah.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.512
When we bounced around
between univ...
Yeah.

19:08.514 --> 19:10.214
And you couldn't figure out
how to...
Yes!

19:10.216 --> 19:11.315
Oh, they're going
to kill him!

19:11.317 --> 19:12.549
We got to get him
out of there!

19:12.551 --> 19:13.484
It's a tough world here.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.586
You hear about it every night
on the dog news.

19:15.588 --> 19:19.123
Coming up, that bush in the park
is my bush!

19:19.125 --> 19:20.791
My bush!

19:30.535 --> 19:32.903
Look, there he is!

19:33.571 --> 19:35.906
Oh, thank God. I'm saved.

19:39.144 --> 19:40.377
Come on,
let's get out of here.

19:40.379 --> 19:41.912
All right, the two of you,
stand over there

19:41.914 --> 19:45.015
and I'll send you back
where you belong.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.352
Gosh, Brian,
I sure hope this next leap...

19:48.354 --> 19:49.920
will be the leap home.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.188
HUMAN BRIAN:
Wait!

19:51.190 --> 19:51.655
Take me with you.

19:51.657 --> 19:53.957
What do you mean? You can't
come back to our universe.

19:53.959 --> 19:56.093
Come on, a place
where humans are in charge?

19:56.095 --> 19:57.828
I can't pass that up.

19:57.830 --> 19:58.829
DOG JOE:
Hey!

19:58.831 --> 20:00.964
Get away from there!

20:09.140 --> 20:11.375
(grunting)

20:24.022 --> 20:25.189
Well, this looks like home.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.124
Is there any way
we can be sure?

20:27.126 --> 20:29.059
Hmm.

20:29.961 --> 20:33.063
Mom, have you seen
my Trapper Keeper?

20:33.065 --> 20:34.164
(farting)

20:34.166 --> 20:35.332
(laughing)

20:35.334 --> 20:37.434
BOTH:
Yeah, we're home!

20:37.436 --> 20:39.203
(laughing)

20:39.205 --> 20:40.938
Well, now, what do we do
about this guy?

20:40.940 --> 20:42.539
We got two Brians
in our universe now.

20:42.541 --> 20:45.475
Don't worry, I don't
plan to stay in Quahog.

20:45.477 --> 20:47.010
I'm gonna go out into the world

20:47.012 --> 20:48.946
and see
what I can make of myself.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.447
I can be somebody here.

20:50.449 --> 20:52.382
And it should be easy
for you, because...

20:52.384 --> 20:54.218
I mean-- what luck--
you're white.

20:54.220 --> 20:57.287
You have no idea
how big that is here.

21:00.024 --> 21:02.059
Good-bye, Stewie.
Good-bye, Brian.

21:02.061 --> 21:05.062
Maybe our paths
will cross again someday.

21:08.266 --> 21:09.233
Ah, look at him go.

21:09.235 --> 21:10.968
Free in a world
of his own kind,

21:10.970 --> 21:13.470
where he can finally reach
the full potential...

21:13.472 --> 21:16.440
Oh, my God!
He got hit by a car!
