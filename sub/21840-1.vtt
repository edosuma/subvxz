01:25.876 --> 01:29.209
March, 1619

01:29.210 --> 01:31.334
A series of battles took place in Sarhu

02:37.043 --> 02:38.626
Look at these Ming bastards.

02:38.626 --> 02:42.626
Stop crying, or I'll cut you to pieces!

02:47.376 --> 02:49.001
Get rid of these two,

02:49.001 --> 02:50.626
then we can head back.

04:19.625 --> 04:21.043
Thanks.

04:24.709 --> 04:27.001
I'm one of Commander Du's guards.

04:27.459 --> 04:28.709
How is he?

04:29.751 --> 04:30.918
Great.

04:32.293 --> 04:33.793
Except he just lost his head.

04:34.668 --> 04:40.251
The reinforcements never showed up...

04:40.584 --> 04:42.834
They're probably dead, too.

04:56.918 --> 05:00.334
Water.

05:09.209 --> 05:10.709
My name is Lu Wenzhao.

05:11.751 --> 05:14.584
My name is Shen Lian.

05:37.001 --> 05:38.876
Tens of thousands of men

05:40.001 --> 05:41.959
cut down like grass.

05:43.626 --> 05:45.918
If we don't want to die like this,

05:49.918 --> 05:52.043
we must find another way to live.

06:02.876 --> 06:04.293
Asura,

06:04.293 --> 06:05.959
one of the Eight Guardian Legions
of Buddhism.

06:06.751 --> 06:13.043
The battle between Asura and Indra
was as fierce as an inferno.

06:17.001 --> 06:18.418
Eight Years Later,

06:18.459 --> 06:23.459
Summer 1627,
Southern District, Beijing

06:36.501 --> 06:37.793
Ding An.

06:37.793 --> 06:38.626
Yes, Your Honor?

06:39.543 --> 06:40.584
Look around back.

06:41.209 --> 06:42.001
Be careful.

06:43.043 --> 06:44.043
Yes, Your Honor.

06:53.751 --> 06:55.168
Your Honor, the box has been emptied.

06:55.168 --> 06:56.293
The money is gone.

06:56.293 --> 06:57.418
Master Guo from the Eastern Depot.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.001
No wonder he looks familiar.

07:00.668 --> 07:01.959
Your Honor.

07:06.959 --> 07:09.501
I told you to get the coroner
from headquarters.

07:09.876 --> 07:10.501
Where is he?

07:10.793 --> 07:11.834
Speak!

07:12.084 --> 07:13.043
Your Honor.

07:13.043 --> 07:14.251
I have failed.

07:14.251 --> 07:16.168
I accidentally ran into the Lieutenant
on the night shift.

07:16.334 --> 07:18.501
He will arrive any minute
with his investigation team.

07:19.459 --> 07:21.793
When they get here,
they'll take the case from us.

07:21.876 --> 07:24.126
It's been half a year
since we got a case this big.

07:26.084 --> 07:26.668
Have you been drinking?

07:27.584 --> 07:29.126
Lieutenant, you're not allowed in there.

07:29.126 --> 07:30.168
Lieutenant,

07:39.043 --> 07:40.376
I'm Lieutenant Ling.

07:40.668 --> 07:42.209
Greetings, Captain.

07:42.459 --> 07:45.209
Is this district under your jurisdiction?

07:48.501 --> 07:49.459
You came pretty quickly.

07:52.584 --> 07:54.584
The owner, three waiters,
and two chefs are dead.

07:54.584 --> 07:55.793
Each was killed with a single stroke.

07:55.793 --> 07:57.376
The money on the counter is gone.

07:58.168 --> 07:58.834
Robbery?

07:59.876 --> 08:01.959
They also killed a master from
the Eastern Depot.

08:07.876 --> 08:08.918
Master Guo.

08:14.084 --> 08:15.001
Your Honor,

08:15.001 --> 08:16.293
today is the Ghost Festival.

08:16.293 --> 08:18.209
I'm sure you're preoccupied

08:18.334 --> 08:19.584
keeping peace on the streets.

08:19.584 --> 08:21.376
Please leave this to me.

08:22.376 --> 08:23.793
What are you waiting for?

08:23.918 --> 08:24.584
Get to work!

08:24.584 --> 08:25.293
Yes, Lieutenant!

08:27.918 --> 08:28.584
Your.

08:30.668 --> 08:31.626
Nobody moves!

08:33.251 --> 08:33.918
Captain?

08:40.418 --> 08:41.668
Lieutenant Ling,
don't you dare steal this case from me.

08:46.001 --> 08:46.709
Of course not.

08:46.709 --> 08:48.084
How long have you been an Imperial Guard?

08:48.418 --> 08:49.793
Don't you understand the rules?

08:50.334 --> 08:52.376
I'm your superior,
and you have no business here.

08:52.376 --> 08:53.168
Captain,

08:53.626 --> 08:55.126
headquarters has already
entered this case into the records.

08:55.126 --> 08:55.751
It's my case now.

08:55.751 --> 08:58.376
This is my turf, so this is my case.

09:00.834 --> 09:02.334
Have I made myself clear?

09:08.709 --> 09:09.418
Yes.

09:11.209 --> 09:12.543
Someone's still alive!

09:12.543 --> 09:13.668
Yin Cheng,

09:14.084 --> 09:15.209
keep your eyes peeled.

09:15.751 --> 09:18.209
Nobody touches anything,
or you'll regret it.

09:18.543 --> 09:19.043
Yes, Your Honor.

09:20.793 --> 09:21.543
Get out.

09:21.543 --> 09:22.668
Don't kill me.

09:23.126 --> 09:24.209
Don't kill me.

09:24.584 --> 09:25.543
You saw it happen?

09:33.459 --> 09:35.001
Last year,
more than ten thousand people died

09:35.001 --> 09:36.168
in the Wanggongchang Explosion.

09:36.543 --> 09:38.168
Last month, His Majesty fell into the lake.

09:38.584 --> 09:40.626
Now a master from the Eastern Depot
is murdered.

09:40.626 --> 09:42.793
There's too much going on in the Capital.

09:43.084 --> 09:44.126
The Emperor fell into the lake?

09:45.334 --> 09:46.084
You didn't hear?

09:46.793 --> 09:48.376
His Majesty was on Taiye Lake
with his new dragon ship,

09:48.376 --> 09:50.251
and suddenly it sank.

09:50.251 --> 09:52.418
A dozen officials became fish food.

09:57.501 --> 09:59.126
His Majesty was saved,

09:59.293 --> 10:00.334
but caught pneumonia.

10:00.543 --> 10:01.876
No medicine can cure him.

10:05.751 --> 10:08.501
Master Wei of the Eastern Depot
has been stressed over it.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.126
Is that so?

10:10.418 --> 10:12.293
What a loyal man Master Wei is.

10:12.293 --> 10:13.501
You don't know a damn thing.

10:13.501 --> 10:14.459
Three years ago,

10:14.459 --> 10:16.168
Chief Prosecutor Yang

10:16.168 --> 10:18.168
brought Master Wei's twenty-four crimes
to the Emperor.

10:18.626 --> 10:20.168
But Master Wei wasn't punished at all.

10:20.168 --> 10:22.793
And completely destroyed the
Donglin Rebellion.

10:23.126 --> 10:24.001
You know why?

10:24.376 --> 10:25.709
Because the Emperor favors him.

10:29.043 --> 10:31.709
But now that His Majesty is ill,

10:31.709 --> 10:32.918
who knows what will happen to Master Wei,

10:32.918 --> 10:34.501
if he can't be healed,

10:34.501 --> 10:36.126
and a new emperor takes the throne.

10:36.584 --> 10:38.126
Now Master Wei is like

10:38.126 --> 10:39.751
a widow peeping at a bridal sedan.

10:39.751 --> 10:40.918
There's nothing he can do.

10:42.918 --> 10:44.793
The Department of Royal Construction
was in charge of building the ship.

10:45.251 --> 10:46.876
Someone's about to lose their head.

10:54.459 --> 10:55.668
Shut your mouth.

10:56.001 --> 10:57.793
You're drunk. Stop embarrassing yourself.

10:58.584 --> 10:59.293
Get lost!

11:04.209 --> 11:05.626
Yin Cheng can't leave.

11:10.126 --> 11:13.709
I've written down every word you said
in my Notebook of Justice.

11:14.418 --> 11:16.668
Where did you hear those stories?

11:17.709 --> 11:19.668
Those libelous words against
His Majesty and the nobles.

11:20.543 --> 11:22.251
You aren't bold enough to make them up.

11:25.043 --> 11:25.834
Tell me.

11:26.626 --> 11:27.959
Who are your accomplices?

11:35.418 --> 11:36.376
Lieutenant,

11:37.209 --> 11:38.251
I've had too much to drink.

11:39.043 --> 11:40.043
Please, spare me.

11:40.751 --> 11:42.126
Please, spare me.

11:44.543 --> 11:46.834
You want to take it upon yourself?

11:50.084 --> 11:51.251
How brave.

11:52.126 --> 11:56.418
Take him to the Imperial Prison.

11:56.418 --> 11:57.293
Yes, Lieutenant.

11:58.543 --> 11:59.501
Lieutenant, forgive me.

11:59.668 --> 12:00.668
Lieutenant, forgive me.

12:01.334 --> 12:02.293
Please!

12:13.543 --> 12:14.209
Put down your blade.

12:14.709 --> 12:15.501
Protect Lieutenant!

12:16.876 --> 12:17.501
Stay back!

12:21.626 --> 12:23.043
Catch him!

12:32.459 --> 12:33.501
Captain Shen,

12:33.959 --> 12:35.709
your men were quite amused

12:36.043 --> 12:38.751
by the story Yin Cheng told.

12:42.793 --> 12:44.251
He laughed.

12:45.126 --> 12:46.126
So did he.

12:46.751 --> 12:48.084
And he.

12:48.793 --> 12:50.084
Captain...

12:53.709 --> 12:54.668
Get Yin Cheng back.

12:55.459 --> 12:56.168
Yes, Captain.

13:49.209 --> 13:50.376
Go!Now!

14:32.543 --> 14:33.293
Captain.

14:33.751 --> 14:34.668
Come with me.

14:51.084 --> 14:51.876
Captain.

14:52.626 --> 14:53.793
Please let me go.

14:54.418 --> 14:55.668
Nobody will know.

15:03.418 --> 15:06.876
Letting you go will jeopardize
our entire team.

15:14.793 --> 15:16.376
I can't go to the Imperial Prison.

15:16.709 --> 15:18.543
We put so many people there.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.334
It's worse than hell.

15:34.709 --> 15:36.084
I'm not going.

16:26.501 --> 16:27.293
Master Jinghai.

16:27.793 --> 16:29.043
A friend has just passed.

16:29.459 --> 16:30.918
Please release his soul from purgatory.

16:31.459 --> 16:32.418
His name is Yin Cheng.

16:33.001 --> 16:34.459
Here is the date and hour of his birth.

16:41.709 --> 16:42.626
Your Honor,

16:43.126 --> 16:46.001
feel free to take whichever you prefer.

16:50.168 --> 16:52.959
Bei Zhai's works are still your favorite.

16:52.959 --> 16:56.168
This black rooster the artist
painted is quite vivid.

17:02.168 --> 17:03.876
I very much enjoy this cricket.

17:46.084 --> 17:49.418
It would be a shame to get those
paintings wet.

18:15.668 --> 18:18.126
My sincere apologies.

18:18.126 --> 18:19.626
Please forgive me.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.376
Most common folk fear the Imperial Guard.

18:23.376 --> 18:24.918
But not you.

18:24.918 --> 18:26.751
What's there to fear? You're not a monster.

18:27.126 --> 18:29.793
What terrifies them is your uniform.

18:31.084 --> 18:32.251
What did you say?

18:33.543 --> 18:34.959
If you don't believe me,

18:35.918 --> 18:38.501
walk around without your uniform.

18:38.834 --> 18:41.959
See what happens.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.084
What's your name?

18:47.626 --> 18:48.626
Where do you live?

18:51.418 --> 18:53.251
Are you arresting me?

19:10.334 --> 19:10.793
Your Honor,

19:12.043 --> 19:13.043
next time you come to this mountain,

19:13.751 --> 19:15.001
bring an umbrella.

19:44.501 --> 19:45.918
High Commander.

19:46.043 --> 19:47.668
Chief.

19:47.834 --> 19:51.959
When do you think Master Wei will
be done fishing?

19:52.376 --> 19:54.543
Here's an urgent report on Jiangxi's
recent flood.

19:54.543 --> 19:55.834
Chen,

19:55.834 --> 19:58.168
Master Wei is quite perturbed.

19:58.668 --> 20:02.209
I urge you not to interrupt him.

20:02.584 --> 20:04.334
I see.

20:07.543 --> 20:09.418
Who's that next to Master Wei?

20:09.418 --> 20:12.876
Lu Wenzhao, Colonel of the Northern Bureau.

20:12.876 --> 20:14.959
He gave me four hundred ounces of silver,

20:14.959 --> 20:17.876
just to stand next to Master Wei
for a moment

20:17.876 --> 20:19.626
Good deal for him.

20:31.751 --> 20:32.959
Master Wei,

20:33.418 --> 20:34.668
a fish.

20:35.668 --> 20:36.918
Fish.

21:16.418 --> 21:18.709
Speak. What do you want?

21:21.001 --> 21:22.209
A position.

21:22.834 --> 21:26.126
I would kill for a chance to serve you.

21:26.418 --> 21:29.834
I would kill for a chance to serve you.

21:32.293 --> 21:34.001
Reclaim the Northeast,

21:34.543 --> 21:36.543
and drive out the Manchurians.

21:36.543 --> 21:37.751
Can you do it?

21:41.043 --> 21:42.293
Suppress the Shandong uprising,

21:42.293 --> 21:43.793
and pacify the roving bandits.

21:44.209 --> 21:45.709
Can you do it?

21:50.543 --> 21:52.209
There's one errand, however.

21:53.251 --> 21:54.959
His Majesty has been ill.

21:56.418 --> 21:59.751
Three-legged golden toads
are needed for his medicine.

22:00.709 --> 22:01.793
Go find them.

22:04.626 --> 22:06.084
My sincere gratitude, Your Excellency.

22:08.918 --> 22:11.001
I'm exhausted.

22:13.126 --> 22:14.793
The fish is yours.

22:18.918 --> 22:20.418
Master.

22:21.001 --> 22:21.709
Please take care.

22:40.168 --> 22:41.793
About Yin Cheng last night,

22:41.793 --> 22:43.668
you two did well.

22:47.418 --> 22:49.334
What's done is done.

22:49.876 --> 22:51.751
Never mention it again.

22:55.876 --> 22:56.918
Colonel.

22:57.626 --> 22:58.751
What about Master Guo's case?

22:58.751 --> 23:00.793
It has been classified as robbery
and murder.

23:00.793 --> 23:02.584
But since the victim
was a member of the Eastern Depot,

23:02.584 --> 23:04.543
the case has been transferred
to the Southern Bureau.

23:04.543 --> 23:06.043
It no longer belongs to the
Northern Bureau.

23:06.043 --> 23:06.668
But...

23:07.834 --> 23:08.501
That's enough.

23:08.626 --> 23:09.959
There's a pro-Donglin Rebellion painter

23:10.293 --> 23:15.418
who's been slighting our government
in paintings and poetry.

23:15.418 --> 23:17.001
Especially criticizing Master Wei.

23:17.001 --> 23:19.209
Such outrageous behavior cannot
be countenanced.

23:19.209 --> 23:20.709
Lieutenant Ling.

23:20.709 --> 23:21.918
Get the painter.

23:21.918 --> 23:25.293
The Eastern Depot wants him dead.

23:25.293 --> 23:27.126
What's his name again?

23:27.543 --> 23:28.834
Bei Zhai.

23:29.126 --> 23:30.501
Master Bei Zhai.

23:30.501 --> 23:31.626
Yes, Colonel.

23:35.418 --> 23:37.126
So this is where Bei Zhai lives.

23:37.376 --> 23:38.584
Captain Shen,

23:38.584 --> 23:42.793
I can't believe you'd fight me
for such trivial case.

23:43.876 --> 23:45.834
I just want to see Bei Zhai for myself.

23:46.626 --> 23:48.501
You can take the credit.

24:08.334 --> 24:08.793
Hold there

24:08.793 --> 24:09.918
Royal guard.

24:14.501 --> 24:16.376
Who else lives here?

24:17.376 --> 24:18.793
Speak!

24:20.376 --> 24:22.043
Are you Bei Zhai?

24:25.168 --> 24:26.251
Answer me!

24:26.251 --> 24:28.293
Are you Bei Zhai or not?

24:29.918 --> 24:32.043
There's no one else.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.168
Stay still.

24:50.293 --> 24:52.376
No doubt she is the one.

24:53.043 --> 24:54.834
You rebel.

24:54.834 --> 24:56.126
Shut your eyes.

25:12.918 --> 25:14.584
Move!

25:22.334 --> 25:23.418
What the hell are you doing?

25:23.709 --> 25:25.751
It'd be a waste to kill her now.

25:27.418 --> 25:28.251
Lieutenant Ling!

25:28.251 --> 25:30.876
You traitors are indeed stubborn.

25:39.376 --> 25:41.168
Get your hands off me!

25:45.084 --> 25:48.043
Killing you directly is
equally entertaining.

26:06.376 --> 26:08.001
What do you think you're doing?

26:08.168 --> 26:09.668
Colonel Lu just wants her dead.

26:09.959 --> 26:11.626
Don't complicate things.

26:12.959 --> 26:15.834
Is it you or me who's complicating things?

26:26.459 --> 26:27.793
You know this woman.

26:27.793 --> 26:28.584
No-.

26:30.876 --> 26:32.918
No wonder you tagged along.

26:43.751 --> 26:44.709
What are you writing?

26:47.084 --> 26:47.959
Shen Lian,

26:48.376 --> 26:50.334
is a supporter of the Donglin rebels.

26:51.668 --> 26:52.293
Give it to me.

26:57.043 --> 26:58.918
You want to kill me?

27:03.001 --> 27:04.834
You don't scare me.

27:10.668 --> 27:11.668
Shen Lian.

27:12.584 --> 27:14.418
You're mine.

27:14.709 --> 27:17.001
I have the proof that you're
helping the rebels.

27:37.043 --> 27:38.168
Hand me your Notebook of Justice.

28:55.001 --> 28:56.209
I dare you.

29:26.834 --> 29:27.709
Shen Lian,

29:28.084 --> 29:29.376
do you have any idea who I am?

29:29.376 --> 29:31.668
Master Wei is my uncle.

29:53.793 --> 29:54.626
Lieutenant Ling!

29:55.168 --> 29:56.293
Lieutenant Ling!

29:58.543 --> 30:00.334
Lieutenant...

30:41.834 --> 30:44.334
Lieutenant Ling and I were ambushed.

30:44.334 --> 30:45.584
How many of them were there?

30:46.084 --> 30:47.126
Two.

30:48.751 --> 30:50.293
Two.

30:51.668 --> 30:53.834
Was one of them Bei Zhai?

30:55.376 --> 30:56.709
I can't say for sure.

30:57.084 --> 31:01.918
Did you know Lieutenant Ling
was Master Wei's nephew?

31:03.126 --> 31:04.334
What a mess.

31:05.668 --> 31:06.959
Commander Han has ordered

31:06.959 --> 31:08.918
the Southern Bureau handle the case.

31:09.543 --> 31:11.168
Even I must be cautious to avoid suspicion.

31:12.168 --> 31:13.168
I have to go greet him now.

31:43.751 --> 31:45.126
Cakes from Glorious Moon Bakery.

31:45.251 --> 31:46.459
Freshly baked this morning.

31:46.459 --> 31:47.459
Have a bite.

31:48.293 --> 31:49.168
And you are...

31:51.334 --> 31:53.918
Well, I used to work at the
Northern Bureau.

31:54.209 --> 31:57.209
I made a mistake
and was demoted to the Southern Bureau.

31:57.543 --> 31:58.918
We've met before.

32:02.834 --> 32:04.126
My name is Pei Lun.

32:04.501 --> 32:06.876
I'm in charge of Lieutenant Ling's case.

32:08.501 --> 32:10.001
Pleasure to meet you.

32:17.543 --> 32:20.126
I have a lotto learn from you.

32:22.584 --> 32:23.626
Shen,

32:24.543 --> 32:25.709
come.

32:33.126 --> 32:34.751
This is not a knife wound.

32:35.001 --> 32:35.793
Scissors.

32:37.209 --> 32:39.168
The criminal attacked Lieutenant Ling
with a pair of scissors.

32:54.584 --> 32:56.459
Go find Lieutenant Ling's
Notebook of Justice.

32:56.459 --> 32:57.543
Yes, Captain.

33:15.834 --> 33:17.626
Do you like paintings?

33:18.876 --> 33:20.168
No-.

33:20.793 --> 33:22.043
Not found.

33:25.918 --> 33:27.418
Have your Notebook of Justice on you?

33:27.626 --> 33:28.751
Shen,

33:30.584 --> 33:31.584
At all times.

33:32.126 --> 33:34.543
I wonder why Lieutenant Ling's
Notebook of Justice

33:34.834 --> 33:37.168
is nowhere to be found.

33:44.501 --> 33:46.168
You'd have to ask him.

33:54.168 --> 33:55.501
I smell rouge.

33:57.376 --> 33:58.418
Shen,

33:58.418 --> 34:01.459
were the two criminals last night men?

34:03.501 --> 34:04.418
Captain Pei,

34:05.209 --> 34:06.709
are you trying to be funny?

34:09.333 --> 34:10.543
Pei,

34:11.833 --> 34:13.168
thanks for your hard work.

34:13.458 --> 34:14.958
Greetings, Your Honor.

34:16.251 --> 34:17.833
Ask me if you have any questions.

34:17.833 --> 34:19.543
Shen Lian will be promoted to
Lieutenant Colonel next year.

34:19.543 --> 34:21.168
Shen Lian will be promoted
to Lieutenant Colonel next year.

34:23.293 --> 34:24.583
I see.

34:25.083 --> 34:28.626
I will be sure to write the report
in his favor.

34:30.293 --> 34:31.333
You have nothing to worry about.

34:31.708 --> 34:33.376
Bei Zhai...

34:36.418 --> 34:37.876
Bei Zhai won't get away with it.

34:54.251 --> 34:55.168
Come on.

35:16.668 --> 35:21.668
Whose punishment is the execution of three
generations of the perpetrator's family

35:22.334 --> 35:26.418
West Mountain, Cloud Hillside. After sunset

35:59.418 --> 36:00.376
Was it you?

36:39.501 --> 36:41.168
Why stop?

37:11.543 --> 37:13.209
You must regret

37:13.334 --> 37:14.959
killing that Imperial Guard.

37:15.709 --> 37:17.293
Where's Bei Zhai?

37:19.334 --> 37:21.668
She's the only witness to your crime.

37:22.084 --> 37:23.793
Why would I bring her with me?

37:23.793 --> 37:24.751
You want money?

37:24.959 --> 37:25.834
No-.

37:26.126 --> 37:29.168
I want you to burn down
the Imperial Guard Archives.

37:31.959 --> 37:32.959
What?

37:32.959 --> 37:34.251
You heard me.

37:35.293 --> 37:37.293
The Archives are extremely important.

37:37.959 --> 37:39.709
If caught,
I'll be executed by a thousand cuts.

37:40.043 --> 37:41.459
Well,

37:43.043 --> 37:45.251
either we turn you in,

37:45.959 --> 37:47.543
or you set the fire.

37:49.209 --> 37:50.626
Your call.

38:01.626 --> 38:03.709
One on three is a challenge.

38:04.251 --> 38:05.751
But if worse comes to worst,

38:05.751 --> 38:07.501
I can still run.

38:25.334 --> 38:27.334
Your skills are from the Frontier Force!

38:27.543 --> 38:28.793
The Frontier Force was no fun.

38:28.918 --> 38:30.251
I enjoy being a bandit more.

38:30.626 --> 38:31.793
Let's go a few more rounds for fun.

38:32.001 --> 38:34.501
How's that?

38:44.376 --> 38:45.543
Chong'er, block his retreat.

39:08.918 --> 39:09.876
Master Ding.

39:10.376 --> 39:11.209
Master Ding.

39:14.251 --> 39:15.126
Master Ding.

39:33.293 --> 39:35.251
You drove away my disciples.

39:35.751 --> 39:37.668
You wanted me from the beginning.

39:38.334 --> 39:39.751
Good thinking.

39:40.876 --> 39:41.751
What a shame.

39:43.209 --> 39:44.043
Okay,

39:44.918 --> 39:46.876
I'll burn the Archives.

39:48.334 --> 39:50.168
But you have to give me Bei Zhai.

40:03.584 --> 40:07.834
Imperial Guard Archive, Northern Bureau

40:08.501 --> 40:09.376
Your Honor.

40:10.793 --> 40:12.126
How do you do?

40:14.876 --> 40:16.584
Why so many Eastern Depot men?

40:17.168 --> 40:18.293
Master Wei has ordered

40:18.293 --> 40:19.126
the Archives closed today

40:19.126 --> 40:21.001
to examine all the documents
on the dragon ship's construction.

40:21.001 --> 40:22.668
You cannot go in.

40:27.418 --> 40:28.043
Your Honor.

40:29.418 --> 40:29.793
Your Honor.

40:29.793 --> 40:30.709
You cannot go in.

40:31.251 --> 40:32.751
Your Honor.

40:33.126 --> 40:33.793
Your Honor.

40:34.043 --> 40:35.418
This area belongs to the Imperial Guard.

40:35.626 --> 40:37.126
You have no authority here.

40:37.251 --> 40:39.876
The Imperial Guard are
Master Wei's watchdogs.

40:41.168 --> 40:44.543
The Bureau is Master Wei's kennel.

40:49.793 --> 40:52.376
No need to overreact.

40:53.043 --> 40:54.709
It's just an investigation.

41:00.418 --> 41:01.584
Inspector Zheng,

41:02.251 --> 41:05.918
let's not get upset with these
small potatoes.

41:09.251 --> 41:11.209
This dragon ship case
is too important to His Majesty.

41:11.376 --> 41:14.418
Cats and dogs can't be allowed in there.

41:14.626 --> 41:15.876
Understand?

41:18.876 --> 41:21.209
Lu, I'm not talking about you.

41:22.376 --> 41:23.251
It's okay.

41:32.376 --> 41:35.043
Lu, you should stay outside, too.

41:35.959 --> 41:37.293
I understand.

41:53.168 --> 41:54.709
You're still under investigation.

41:54.709 --> 41:56.251
What are you doing here?

41:59.459 --> 42:01.709
Pei Lun from the Southern Bureau

42:02.334 --> 42:03.584
has his eyes on you.

42:03.834 --> 42:05.293
Watch out.

42:24.251 --> 42:25.293
I'll get this.

42:25.293 --> 42:26.626
Go.

42:30.376 --> 42:31.584
Your Honor.

42:34.626 --> 42:35.751
Please enjoy.

42:51.334 --> 42:52.793
The vegetarian meals of Yong'an Temple

42:53.126 --> 42:54.668
certainly deserve their reputation.

42:58.626 --> 43:00.168
Master Jinghai,

43:01.126 --> 43:04.293
I heard you've been
collecting Bei Zhai's paintings.

43:05.376 --> 43:07.001
Where do you keep them?

43:08.376 --> 43:09.293
Yes.

43:09.626 --> 43:12.293
I have many paintings,

43:12.376 --> 43:14.876
a few are by Bei Zhai.

43:15.293 --> 43:19.126
I give them away to our donors
to express our gratitude

43:20.626 --> 43:21.543
Like whom?

43:24.584 --> 43:26.126
I'm afraid I can't remember.

43:31.918 --> 43:33.501
You know,

43:34.043 --> 43:35.584
Bei Zhai is a Donglin rebel.

43:36.043 --> 43:38.001
I must know who's been collecting
his paintings.

43:38.418 --> 43:39.418
Your Honor,

43:40.459 --> 43:42.334
paintings are just paintings.

43:43.126 --> 43:44.168
Besides,

43:44.459 --> 43:48.126
our donors are very good people.

43:59.209 --> 44:01.209
Monk Jinghai says,

44:01.751 --> 44:04.918
those who collect Donglin rebel paintings

44:05.834 --> 44:08.459
are very good people.

44:33.543 --> 44:35.376
This one sentence

44:35.584 --> 44:39.168
could ruin Master Jinghai's life's work.

44:57.834 --> 44:58.793
Now tell me,

45:06.043 --> 45:08.168
who collected Bei Zhai's paintings?

45:22.293 --> 45:23.751
My apologies for keeping you here.

45:24.209 --> 45:26.126
Please don't say that, Master Ding.

45:28.209 --> 45:29.459
His Highness

45:29.793 --> 45:31.293
has been thinking about you.

45:36.168 --> 45:37.251
I know.

45:42.418 --> 45:43.709
Your Highness.

45:44.376 --> 45:47.959
How is she?

45:56.543 --> 45:58.459
Wo-style swordplay.

45:59.668 --> 46:01.918
She's a descendant of Qi.

46:12.709 --> 46:13.626
Father,

46:14.376 --> 46:16.543
please bless me.

46:35.876 --> 46:38.543
One stick of incense for one round.

47:38.376 --> 47:39.584
Master Wei has ordered

47:39.709 --> 47:40.501
the Archives closed today

47:40.501 --> 47:42.459
to examine all the documents
on the dragon ship's construction.

47:42.459 --> 47:44.251
His Majesty was on Taiye Lake
with his new dragon ship,

47:44.251 --> 47:46.251
and suddenly it sank.

47:46.251 --> 47:48.209
This dragon ship case
is too important to His Majesty.

47:48.209 --> 47:50.584
Lu, you should stay outside, too.

47:58.251 --> 47:58.959
Inspector Zheng.

47:58.959 --> 47:59.543
Open the doors.

47:59.543 --> 48:00.251
Yes, Your Honor.

48:00.459 --> 48:01.459
You two wait here.

48:01.459 --> 48:02.334
Yes, Your Honor.

48:33.501 --> 48:37.126
The ship frame left the factory twice
for examination.

48:38.334 --> 48:39.376
Examiner,

48:39.793 --> 48:40.876
Guo Zhen.

48:41.293 --> 48:42.793
Master Guo from the Eastern Depot.

48:42.793 --> 48:44.293
No wonder he looks familiar.

48:49.709 --> 48:53.084
Guo was Grand Secretary
of the Department of Royal Construction.

49:21.584 --> 49:27.209
I was planning to call
the watchmen after you left the yard.

49:27.584 --> 49:30.084
I underestimated your vigilance.

49:30.793 --> 49:32.126
No need to look around.

49:32.126 --> 49:33.668
There's only me.

49:52.334 --> 49:53.459
Show me your face!

50:08.959 --> 50:10.459
The Imperial Brocade Blade!

50:10.459 --> 50:12.876
You're an Imperial Guard!

51:15.334 --> 51:16.793
Too late to run.

51:20.209 --> 51:21.876
You're dead meat.

51:51.543 --> 51:52.459
You little traitor.

51:52.459 --> 51:54.001
How dare you set fire to the Archives!

52:16.084 --> 52:16.959
It's you!

53:15.376 --> 53:17.209
I saw the fire.

53:18.043 --> 53:19.334
Where's Bei Zhai?

53:22.126 --> 53:22.959
I'm sorry.

53:31.168 --> 53:33.709
You killed Guo, didn't you?

53:36.793 --> 53:41.043
I didn't know he was the Grand Secretary
of the Department of Royal Construction.

53:41.043 --> 53:43.001
He sabotaged the ship.

53:43.001 --> 53:45.376
Almost killed the Emperor.

53:52.376 --> 53:53.584
What do you want?

53:53.876 --> 53:56.084
I have the
"Construction Log of the Dragon Ship."

53:56.084 --> 53:58.709
I'll trade it for Bei Zhai.

54:01.376 --> 54:02.959
She's not here.

54:02.959 --> 54:04.543
You two belong to the same gang.

54:04.959 --> 54:06.459
If you can't make the deal,

54:06.459 --> 54:08.001
tell your master to come see me.

54:15.876 --> 54:17.501
If I die,

54:17.501 --> 54:20.418
the Log will be sent to the Bureau.

54:55.501 --> 54:56.834
Shen,

54:58.043 --> 55:00.209
I've been waiting for a while.

55:05.376 --> 55:06.876
You're back.

55:07.209 --> 55:09.376
What a beautiful wife you have.

55:09.918 --> 55:11.834
You lucky bastard.

55:13.084 --> 55:14.168
You must be hungry.

55:14.709 --> 55:15.959
I'll go buy some groceries.

55:17.126 --> 55:18.584
No need.

55:18.959 --> 55:20.918
Just make us some noodles.

55:38.834 --> 55:39.876
Captain Pei,

55:40.168 --> 55:41.293
there's still some left in the pot
if you want more.

55:41.293 --> 55:42.584
No, I'm good.

55:43.168 --> 55:44.126
Let's get down to business.

55:45.209 --> 55:48.709
I've made some progress on
Master Guo's case.

55:48.876 --> 55:50.876
I find it quite interesting.

55:51.584 --> 55:52.293
Interesting?

55:53.709 --> 55:57.418
Guo went to the Golden Pavilion
to meet someone.

56:01.376 --> 56:03.543
Guo's driver said,

56:03.543 --> 56:05.626
there was a young man waiting
for him inside.

56:05.918 --> 56:07.251
Don't wait for me.

56:07.251 --> 56:08.001
Yes.

56:08.709 --> 56:11.876
Guo's death was not a coincidence.

56:12.626 --> 56:14.709
It was planned.

56:15.668 --> 56:19.334
I found this in Guo's mansion.

56:27.293 --> 56:29.834
I will meet you there, -Bei Zhai

56:33.918 --> 56:34.751
Bei Zhai.

56:35.001 --> 56:35.959
Correct.

56:36.459 --> 56:39.626
That young man must have been Bei Zhai.

56:40.751 --> 56:44.834
Bei Zhai is the key
to solving Guo and Ling's cases.

56:45.168 --> 56:47.543
I've been investigating
Bei Zhai's paintings,

56:48.209 --> 56:50.209
and discovered some juicy information.

56:51.543 --> 56:53.668
Monk Jinghai at Yong'an Temple said...

56:54.126 --> 56:55.668
You know him, right?

56:59.626 --> 57:01.043
Yes.

57:01.043 --> 57:02.584
The monk said,

57:03.459 --> 57:06.001
you've collected a handful of
Bei Zhai's works.

57:10.584 --> 57:11.834
Where's Master Jinghai?

57:12.501 --> 57:14.168
In the Imperial Prison.

57:14.168 --> 57:15.959
His life depends on what you're
about to say.

57:16.959 --> 57:20.293
If you say his accusation is false,

57:20.293 --> 57:21.668
I will get rid of him for you.

57:24.376 --> 57:25.793
But if you want to save him,

57:27.043 --> 57:29.293
then give me Bei Zhai's paintings.

57:30.793 --> 57:32.126
I don't have any.

57:34.459 --> 57:36.001
You're a stubborn man.

57:37.501 --> 57:39.584
The monk said you two were friends.

57:40.626 --> 57:46.001
But that word doesn't seem to
mean anything to you.

58:01.126 --> 58:02.334
Pei Lun.

58:03.918 --> 58:05.834
You're trying to frame me
as Bei Zhai's accomplice.

58:09.918 --> 58:11.459
Nonsense.

58:12.251 --> 58:14.668
My future rests on these two cases.

58:14.668 --> 58:16.084
How could I not take them seriously?

58:17.418 --> 58:18.543
Besides,

58:18.834 --> 58:20.209
you know better than I do

58:20.501 --> 58:22.293
whether this is a false charge.

58:25.126 --> 58:27.043
Why are you picking on me?

58:28.334 --> 58:30.334
You want to know why?

58:31.459 --> 58:32.793
Among all the Imperial Guards,

58:32.793 --> 58:34.251
I had only one friend.

58:34.626 --> 58:35.751
His name was Yin Cheng.

58:40.959 --> 58:42.251
And you killed him.

59:06.668 --> 59:07.751
What are you looking for?

59:11.043 --> 59:12.751
The "Construction Log of the Dragon Ship."

59:13.626 --> 59:15.709
Give it to me,
and I'll guarantee you safe passage.

59:32.918 --> 59:34.001
What are you going to do?

59:34.251 --> 59:35.668
I ask and you answer.

59:36.084 --> 59:37.376
Don't even think about lying.

59:38.376 --> 59:39.751
Was it you who disguised yourself as a man

59:39.751 --> 59:41.334
and made an appointment with Guo?

59:43.168 --> 59:45.376
Was it Ding who killed him?

59:47.126 --> 59:48.668
You think I won't kill you?

59:49.001 --> 59:50.834
I must be crazy,

59:50.834 --> 59:53.043
for rescuing an assassin
who tried to kill the Emperor.

59:54.793 --> 59:55.876
I didn't.

59:55.876 --> 59:57.126
Stop lying!

01:00:01.751 --> 01:00:03.626
I will make you confess

01:00:03.918 --> 01:00:05.459
one way or another.

01:00:05.459 --> 01:00:06.543
It was me.

01:00:07.418 --> 01:00:10.918
I disguised myself
and lured Guo to the Golden Pavilion

01:00:11.418 --> 01:00:13.126
for Master Ding to kill him.

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:14.959
Who's behind all this?

01:00:15.959 --> 01:00:17.334
Nobody.

01:00:20.001 --> 01:00:22.126
Don't try to be a hero.

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:31.376
If you don't want to drown, give me a name.

01:00:31.959 --> 01:00:33.376
Now!

01:00:35.209 --> 01:00:36.584
Nobody.

01:00:37.918 --> 01:00:38.918
It was me.

01:00:39.543 --> 01:00:42.334
You would die for him?

01:00:47.709 --> 01:00:48.543
Confess!

01:00:58.168 --> 01:00:59.001
Speak!

01:01:51.126 --> 01:01:52.293
One day, when I was very young,

01:01:52.293 --> 01:01:54.168
my father was teaching me to paint.

01:01:56.459 --> 01:01:58.543
Imperial Guards broke into our house.

01:01:58.668 --> 01:02:03.001
They accused my father of writing poems
that slighted Master Wei.

01:02:03.834 --> 01:02:05.876
Our entire family was torn apart,

01:02:06.793 --> 01:02:08.126
just because my father wrote some poems.

01:02:08.126 --> 01:02:10.209
Some were killed, others exiled.

01:02:12.793 --> 01:02:17.001
I was banished to a brothel in the south.

01:02:18.918 --> 01:02:19.876
When the ship arrived at Datong River,

01:02:19.876 --> 01:02:21.376
<i>I</i> jumped.

01:02:21.543 --> 01:02:25.501
I didn't know drowning
could be so tortuous until that moment.

01:02:30.084 --> 01:02:31.543
It was he who saved me.

01:02:33.168 --> 01:02:34.626
He promised me

01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:38.376
he would do everything he could
to kill Wei,

01:02:39.293 --> 01:02:41.084
and wipe out his entire party.

01:02:45.876 --> 01:02:47.376
So you decided to join him

01:02:47.376 --> 01:02:49.376
because of that one promise?

01:02:50.334 --> 01:02:53.793
Aren't you fed up with this life?

01:02:55.834 --> 01:02:57.543
Life is hard. Nobody can change that.

01:03:11.751 --> 01:03:12.626
You Honor.

01:03:26.959 --> 01:03:28.418
He's alive

01:03:28.626 --> 01:03:30.418
but unlikely to wake up.

01:03:32.334 --> 01:03:34.751
Criminals dare to kill
and commit arson on our very doorstep.

01:03:35.543 --> 01:03:39.126
This is certainly a first
in the Great Ming Dynasty.

01:03:39.876 --> 01:03:42.168
You dare call yourselves the
Imperial Guards?

01:03:42.543 --> 01:03:43.709
You bastards

01:03:55.793 --> 01:03:56.876
Shen Lian.

01:03:57.876 --> 01:03:59.209
Shen Lian.

01:04:02.001 --> 01:04:03.418
Shen Lian.

01:04:17.084 --> 01:04:18.376
What did he say?

01:04:18.918 --> 01:04:20.876
I don't know.

01:04:42.626 --> 01:04:44.459
Colonel.

01:04:45.626 --> 01:04:47.209
Yes?

01:04:48.751 --> 01:04:50.501
Let's speak in private.

01:04:51.751 --> 01:04:55.501
Shen has something to do
with Guo and Ling's death.

01:04:55.501 --> 01:04:56.834
Colonel,

01:04:56.834 --> 01:04:59.418
this might be the most important case
in the history of the Dynasty.

01:05:00.584 --> 01:05:01.918
This is conjecture.

01:05:01.918 --> 01:05:03.084
Do you have proof?

01:05:03.459 --> 01:05:05.001
The Archives have burned down,

01:05:05.001 --> 01:05:06.543
but parts of the documents remain.

01:05:06.543 --> 01:05:08.459
I've looked into Shen and
Guo's backgrounds.

01:05:08.959 --> 01:05:10.334
Eight years ago, in the Battle of Sarhu,

01:05:10.501 --> 01:05:12.626
Shen and Guo served together in
the West Army.

01:05:13.001 --> 01:05:14.793
Though the army was destroyed,

01:05:14.793 --> 01:05:16.959
Shen and Guo survived.

01:05:17.418 --> 01:05:20.959
I believe the two
already knew each other back then.

01:05:28.959 --> 01:05:30.043
Who's there?

01:05:30.376 --> 01:05:31.334
Show yourselves.

01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:41.376
How bold of you.

01:05:45.084 --> 01:05:46.584
Let me take care of them.

01:05:46.918 --> 01:05:48.501
You...

01:06:00.668 --> 01:06:02.001
Lu Wenzhao.

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:04.584
Ding.

01:06:06.834 --> 01:06:07.834
Kill him.

01:06:08.251 --> 01:06:09.376
Chong'er.

01:06:34.168 --> 01:06:36.334
Tens of thousands of men

01:06:36.334 --> 01:06:38.501
cut down like grass.

01:06:39.418 --> 01:06:41.043
If we don't want to die like this,

01:06:41.834 --> 01:06:43.834
we must find another way to live.

01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:45.043
I don't want to die.

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:46.584
I don't want to die.

01:06:47.126 --> 01:06:48.251
Another way to live.

01:06:48.251 --> 01:06:49.626
Find another way to live.

01:06:49.626 --> 01:06:50.209
I don't want to die.

01:06:50.209 --> 01:06:51.584
Another way to live.

01:06:54.834 --> 01:06:55.668
Guo.

01:06:56.251 --> 01:06:58.209
Lu and Guo knew each other.

01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:25.626
Shen Lian.

01:08:27.001 --> 01:08:29.751
Yin Cheng was my friend, too.

01:08:33.667 --> 01:08:34.917
Thanks to the breastplate,

01:08:34.917 --> 01:08:36.376
the wound isn't lethal.

01:08:40.959 --> 01:08:42.917
Thank you, Mrs. Shen.

01:08:47.834 --> 01:08:50.834
I'm not...

01:08:52.459 --> 01:08:54.126
This is Bei Zhai.

01:09:14.751 --> 01:09:15.584
Colonel.

01:09:17.709 --> 01:09:19.042
Inspector Zheng didn't die.

01:09:19.542 --> 01:09:21.042
He said it was you.

01:09:21.459 --> 01:09:23.209
I already covered it up.

01:09:23.376 --> 01:09:24.959
You killed Ling, didn't you?

01:09:25.084 --> 01:09:26.209
Pei Lun figured it out.

01:09:26.501 --> 01:09:28.167
I covered that up as well.

01:09:29.126 --> 01:09:31.376
Why? Because you once saved my life.

01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:33.376
We're friends.

01:09:35.001 --> 01:09:36.376
Friends.

01:09:38.959 --> 01:09:41.084
You and Guo knew each other
eight years ago.

01:09:41.584 --> 01:09:43.417
You fought shoulder to shoulder
in the army.

01:09:44.251 --> 01:09:46.167
You told him to sabotage the ship,

01:09:47.501 --> 01:09:49.084
then killed him.

01:09:49.084 --> 01:09:51.376
Then asked me to burn down the Archives.

01:09:53.417 --> 01:09:55.209
Now you say we're friends?

01:09:56.584 --> 01:09:58.459
You didn't have to get involved.

01:09:58.918 --> 01:10:02.334
Why did you save Bei Zhai and Captain Pei?

01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:04.501
You're colluding with the rebels.

01:10:05.959 --> 01:10:08.126
I can turn you in.

01:10:16.209 --> 01:10:17.334
Go ahead.

01:10:17.876 --> 01:10:21.209
I have people everywhere,

01:10:21.334 --> 01:10:22.834
in every administrative and
judicial department

01:10:23.084 --> 01:10:24.959
in every state and prefecture.

01:10:24.959 --> 01:10:26.501
We can make black become white

01:10:26.501 --> 01:10:28.626
by just tapping our fingers.

01:10:29.168 --> 01:10:30.543
How can you fight me?

01:10:31.918 --> 01:10:32.959
You plan to overthrow the Emperor?

01:10:33.251 --> 01:10:34.834
Wei and his party
lost the people's trust long ago.

01:10:34.834 --> 01:10:36.876
They'll be overthrown sooner or later.

01:10:37.876 --> 01:10:41.168
You can't be willing to let these
useless scumbags rule you.

01:10:46.959 --> 01:10:48.918
We shouldn't be wasting time like this.

01:10:48.918 --> 01:10:51.043
Now we need to get the real job done.

01:10:52.293 --> 01:10:53.293
Go in there,

01:10:53.293 --> 01:10:55.168
and finish off Bei Zhai and Pei Lun.

01:10:55.959 --> 01:10:58.709
Give me the
"Construction Log of the Dragon Ship,"

01:10:58.709 --> 01:11:00.126
then you can live.

01:11:05.126 --> 01:11:07.918
You want me to trade Bei Zhai
and Pei Lun's lives for mine.

01:11:09.459 --> 01:11:11.459
What's the difference between you and Wei?

01:11:11.459 --> 01:11:13.084
You're the same.

01:11:13.084 --> 01:11:14.043
Get off your high horse.

01:11:14.043 --> 01:11:15.501
You think you're a good person?

01:11:15.501 --> 01:11:16.709
How many lives have you taken

01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:17.876
with your blood-stained hands?

01:11:20.626 --> 01:11:22.334
Does your master know

01:11:22.834 --> 01:11:24.668
you plan to kill Bei Zhai?

01:13:13.584 --> 01:13:14.918
Move.

01:13:38.126 --> 01:13:40.418
The "Construction Log of the Dragon Ship"?

01:14:06.209 --> 01:14:07.543
Trying to steal it and run?

01:14:07.543 --> 01:14:09.543
$0?

01:14:12.668 --> 01:14:14.876
I'll keep it for you.

01:14:15.834 --> 01:14:17.043
Go to sleep.

01:14:31.626 --> 01:14:34.168
Lu must be looking everywhere for us.

01:14:37.459 --> 01:14:38.709
Don't you think I know that?

01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:41.543
You have Bei Zhai and the Log.

01:14:42.001 --> 01:14:43.334
What are you afraid of?

01:14:43.793 --> 01:14:45.418
We can't do anything to Lu.

01:14:45.418 --> 01:14:46.959
His people are everywhere inside
the system.

01:14:47.543 --> 01:14:48.793
What about the Court of Censors?

01:14:49.376 --> 01:14:51.209
I have something on the Imperial Censor.

01:14:52.084 --> 01:14:53.834
He'll be more than willing to help us.

01:14:58.959 --> 01:15:00.126
You can't leave her?

01:15:01.459 --> 01:15:03.834
We'll all die together then.

01:15:54.001 --> 01:15:54.501
Your honor,

01:15:55.043 --> 01:15:56.459
let's wait for the rain to stop.

01:15:56.459 --> 01:15:58.418
Let's wait for the rain to stop.

01:17:06.209 --> 01:17:07.376
Lu Wenzhao!

01:17:08.334 --> 01:17:09.918
You posted arrest warrants citywide

01:17:09.918 --> 01:17:12.251
without your superiors' approval.

01:17:13.126 --> 01:17:15.876
Do you think we don't exist?

01:17:16.876 --> 01:17:17.668
Chief,

01:17:18.084 --> 01:17:19.584
if you don't punish this dog severely,

01:17:19.876 --> 01:17:22.959
how will your men listen to you in
the future?

01:17:33.334 --> 01:17:36.459
Captain Shen of the Northern Bureau

01:17:36.459 --> 01:17:39.126
and Captain Pei of the Southern Bureau

01:17:39.918 --> 01:17:44.793
bribed Master Guo to murder His Majesty.

01:17:47.168 --> 01:17:48.584
Luckily, they failed.

01:17:49.459 --> 01:17:53.918
The duo killed Master Guo to silence him,

01:17:54.334 --> 01:17:56.626
then set fire to the Archives.

01:17:57.334 --> 01:17:59.251
Lieutenant Ling

01:18:00.334 --> 01:18:04.251
was also killed by Shen.

01:18:04.251 --> 01:18:07.251
I have acquired Inspector
Zheng's testimony as evidence.

01:18:08.084 --> 01:18:09.501
To prevent the duo's escape,

01:18:09.501 --> 01:18:11.126
I took the liberty of delivering
the message

01:18:11.126 --> 01:18:12.501
to the Ministry of Security,

01:18:12.501 --> 01:18:13.709
and city administrators.

01:18:13.709 --> 01:18:15.334
That they be found immediately.

01:18:20.376 --> 01:18:21.959
Where's the girl?

01:18:22.959 --> 01:18:24.168
I lost her.

01:18:24.168 --> 01:18:25.876
Where's the Log?

01:18:27.001 --> 01:18:28.626
You gave it to her?

01:18:30.293 --> 01:18:32.626
Our lives depend on that Log!

01:18:32.626 --> 01:18:34.459
And you gave it to her!

01:19:03.418 --> 01:19:05.293
Colonel Lu,

01:19:06.584 --> 01:19:12.168
assigning you to catch toads
was a waste of your talents.

01:19:14.001 --> 01:19:14.918
It's my honor to...

01:19:14.918 --> 01:19:16.501
The two rebels
who put themselves in such jeopardy,

01:19:17.084 --> 01:19:22.584
tell me,
who do you think they're working for?

01:19:25.668 --> 01:19:26.584
I think...

01:19:27.251 --> 01:19:28.043
I think...

01:19:28.043 --> 01:19:30.168
Remove all the Imperial Guards from
the streets immediately.

01:19:36.084 --> 01:19:38.543
The Eastern Depot is taking over this case.

01:19:39.251 --> 01:19:41.334
Shen, Pei.

01:19:41.334 --> 01:19:42.918
Bei Zhai.

01:19:43.668 --> 01:19:45.793
I want them alive.

01:19:47.709 --> 01:19:49.334
Why did you return?

01:19:49.334 --> 01:19:50.834
To save you,

01:19:51.501 --> 01:19:53.251
and Captain Pei.

01:19:54.168 --> 01:19:55.001
How?

01:19:56.001 --> 01:19:57.418
If I give him this Log,

01:19:57.709 --> 01:20:00.626
His Highness will spare us.

01:20:01.209 --> 01:20:03.168
Do you know why I was sent to kill you?

01:20:03.168 --> 01:20:04.751
It was Lu's order.

01:20:05.084 --> 01:20:06.626
I don't know Lu.

01:20:06.626 --> 01:20:08.043
That boyfriend of yours

01:20:08.043 --> 01:20:09.751
is Lu's master.

01:20:10.126 --> 01:20:11.626
The man you're guarding with your own life

01:20:11.626 --> 01:20:12.834
wants you dead.

01:20:12.834 --> 01:20:14.418
Are you still going to see him?

01:20:16.376 --> 01:20:18.168
That can't be his intention.

01:20:18.418 --> 01:20:19.918
He wouldn't kill me.

01:20:20.626 --> 01:20:22.001
You still believe in him?

01:20:22.418 --> 01:20:24.043
I believe in myself.

01:20:27.751 --> 01:20:32.126
I believe that one day
we will have the freedom of speech.

01:20:45.459 --> 01:20:47.501
In every administrative and
judicial department

01:20:47.501 --> 01:20:48.501
in every state and prefecture.

01:20:48.501 --> 01:20:49.293
I'm a rebel.

01:20:49.293 --> 01:20:50.293
I have people everywhere.

01:20:50.293 --> 01:20:51.918
Chief Prosecutor Yang

01:20:51.918 --> 01:20:53.709
brought Master Wei's
twenty-four crimes to the Emperor.

01:20:53.709 --> 01:20:54.793
He promised me

01:20:54.793 --> 01:20:56.043
he would do everything he could
to kill Wei,

01:20:56.043 --> 01:20:58.168
and wipe out his entire party.

01:20:58.168 --> 01:21:00.543
Wei and his party
lost the people's trust long ago.

01:21:00.543 --> 01:21:01.834
But Master Wei wasn't punished at all.

01:21:01.834 --> 01:21:04.418
And completely destroyed the
Donglin Rebellion.

01:21:04.418 --> 01:21:05.168
Why?

01:21:05.168 --> 01:21:09.418
Because the Emperor favors him.

01:21:12.251 --> 01:21:14.626
Why didn't I realize this earlier?

01:21:17.084 --> 01:21:18.251
I'll go in your stead.

01:21:18.793 --> 01:21:20.793
What if it's a trap?

01:22:01.418 --> 01:22:02.668
Do you know who I am?

01:22:03.334 --> 01:22:04.626
I think I do.

01:22:05.293 --> 01:22:06.584
Let's hear it.

01:22:07.126 --> 01:22:08.376
I should have guessed.

01:22:08.918 --> 01:22:10.709
Assassinating the Emperor was
never your goal.

01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:12.126
The goal of Your Highness

01:22:12.126 --> 01:22:13.793
was to eliminate Wei and his party.

01:22:14.293 --> 01:22:16.668
And the only one who can do that
is the Emperor.

01:22:17.376 --> 01:22:18.876
His Majesty has no children.

01:22:19.793 --> 01:22:21.126
If he died, the only successor

01:22:21.751 --> 01:22:26.626
would be his younger brother,

01:22:27.459 --> 01:22:29.376
Zhu Youjian, Prince Xin.

01:22:32.209 --> 01:22:33.751
Am I correct?

01:22:34.501 --> 01:22:35.918
Prince Xin, Your Highness.

01:22:39.543 --> 01:22:41.501
Do you know this place?

01:22:45.084 --> 01:22:47.876
What if Shen doesn't return in one hour?

01:22:48.584 --> 01:22:50.543
Then we break into the Eastern Depot.

01:22:58.959 --> 01:23:00.334
If Wei had gotten a hold of this Log,

01:23:00.334 --> 01:23:04.751
many would have lost their heads.

01:23:07.668 --> 01:23:09.543
What do you want?

01:23:09.959 --> 01:23:11.751
I want to live.

01:23:12.209 --> 01:23:15.084
One more thing Your Highness needs to know.

01:23:15.084 --> 01:23:17.168
Lu wants Bei Zhai dead.

01:23:17.418 --> 01:23:18.918
Nonsense.

01:23:18.918 --> 01:23:20.918
Brother Lu has no reason to hurt her.

01:23:22.876 --> 01:23:23.959
Your Highness,

01:23:23.959 --> 01:23:25.126
this man is dangerous.

01:23:25.126 --> 01:23:26.626
Get out.

01:23:36.959 --> 01:23:38.584
We're almost out of time.

01:23:40.876 --> 01:23:42.584
He'll be back.

01:23:46.751 --> 01:23:48.459
Have you two slept together?

01:23:51.626 --> 01:23:53.376
You're disgusting.

01:23:54.293 --> 01:23:55.459
No?

01:23:55.751 --> 01:23:59.501
Then why are you treating each
other like this?

01:24:03.209 --> 01:24:04.543
Where is she?

01:24:05.376 --> 01:24:06.293
Bei Zhai?

01:24:08.001 --> 01:24:09.918
You don't even know her real name.

01:24:13.418 --> 01:24:15.334
You dared to come see me.

01:24:15.334 --> 01:24:17.084
Didn't you fear that I'd kill you?

01:24:18.793 --> 01:24:20.793
I wanted to see for myself

01:24:20.793 --> 01:24:22.751
the man she's guarding with her life.

01:24:23.251 --> 01:24:24.793
If he's worth it.

01:24:31.876 --> 01:24:33.293
No,

01:24:33.584 --> 01:24:35.084
you're worried about her.

01:24:36.001 --> 01:24:38.334
So you came in her stead.

01:24:40.918 --> 01:24:43.168
You like her.

01:24:47.793 --> 01:24:49.626
But does she like you?

01:24:50.584 --> 01:24:52.459
Your Highness misunderstood.

01:24:57.543 --> 01:24:59.376
She told me

01:24:59.543 --> 01:25:01.209
you were supposed to kill her,

01:25:03.293 --> 01:25:05.084
but ended up saving her.

01:25:07.668 --> 01:25:08.793
Why?

01:25:11.251 --> 01:25:12.543
I admire her paintings.

01:25:15.251 --> 01:25:16.959
I understand.

01:25:19.043 --> 01:25:21.834
Her paintings are like her person.

01:25:24.459 --> 01:25:25.834
What a shame.

01:25:29.209 --> 01:25:30.626
Take this tablet of the
Mansion of Prince Xin.

01:25:30.918 --> 01:25:32.709
You can go anywhere you like.

01:25:32.709 --> 01:25:34.751
Nobody will stop you when
they see this tablet.

01:25:37.709 --> 01:25:39.751
However, you must kill her first.

01:25:48.918 --> 01:25:51.293
Wei is looking everywhere for her.

01:25:52.626 --> 01:25:53.834
I cannot risk it.

01:25:55.376 --> 01:25:56.501
Your Highness.

01:25:57.001 --> 01:25:58.543
Bei Zhai didn't betray you,

01:25:58.918 --> 01:26:00.168
and never will.

01:26:00.168 --> 01:26:02.418
I want you to betray her.

01:26:21.459 --> 01:26:23.126
This is my blade.

01:26:26.543 --> 01:26:28.334
I'm taking her out of the city.

01:26:29.793 --> 01:26:31.501
If you send men after us,

01:26:33.626 --> 01:26:35.418
I'll take them all down.

01:26:36.209 --> 01:26:39.459
You're not going to kill me?

01:26:40.459 --> 01:26:42.043
She'll be sad if I do.

01:26:43.376 --> 01:26:44.668
She'll be sad if I do.

01:27:01.918 --> 01:27:03.293
Time's up.

01:27:08.918 --> 01:27:09.709
Your Highness.

01:27:09.709 --> 01:27:10.834
Enough.

01:27:11.418 --> 01:27:12.834
I'll send someone after Shen,

01:27:12.834 --> 01:27:14.251
we can follow him to Bei Zhai.

01:27:15.626 --> 01:27:17.293
Colonel Lu...

01:27:19.543 --> 01:27:20.584
Your Highness,

01:27:20.584 --> 01:27:22.793
she knows way too much.

01:27:22.959 --> 01:27:27.459
Thousands will die if she doesn't.

01:27:35.126 --> 01:27:36.834
Do it outside the city.

01:27:37.209 --> 01:27:38.793
Yes, Your Highness.

01:28:19.251 --> 01:28:20.793
Shen Lian!

01:28:48.959 --> 01:28:54.168
He said he'd come find me, right?

01:28:55.543 --> 01:28:57.126
Of course.

01:28:57.126 --> 01:29:00.126
He'll come find you once it's safe.

01:29:00.751 --> 01:29:02.126
He also said,

01:29:03.043 --> 01:29:07.001
you should feel free to paint
whatever you like.

01:29:09.876 --> 01:29:12.126
He doesn't like me painting.

01:29:12.543 --> 01:29:14.751
He said that's where all troubles begin.

01:29:18.001 --> 01:29:19.793
Thank you.

01:29:39.334 --> 01:29:42.959
Wei Zhongxian's Mansion, Goldfish Alley

01:29:52.418 --> 01:29:53.793
Your Excellency,

01:29:53.959 --> 01:29:55.334
please save me.

01:29:55.334 --> 01:29:56.668
What's bothering you, Your Highness?

01:29:56.668 --> 01:30:00.084
This girlfriend of mine recently
disappeared.

01:30:00.084 --> 01:30:01.626
I sent people to look for her,

01:30:01.626 --> 01:30:03.793
and discovered that
she's one of the Donglin rebels.

01:30:04.209 --> 01:30:06.668
She also has something to do
with Master Guo's death.

01:30:06.668 --> 01:30:07.959
Is that so?

01:30:07.959 --> 01:30:08.751
A Colonel Lu from the Imperial Guard

01:30:08.751 --> 01:30:11.043
found out about this,

01:30:12.459 --> 01:30:14.293
and came to threaten me.

01:30:16.793 --> 01:30:17.793
Lu Wenzhao?

01:30:17.793 --> 01:30:18.834
Yes.

01:30:19.084 --> 01:30:20.834
Colonel Lu wanted to frame Your Excellency

01:30:20.834 --> 01:30:25.084
by having me speak falsely
before His Majesty.

01:30:25.084 --> 01:30:27.418
Otherwise, he'd impeach me
with this information.

01:30:31.251 --> 01:30:33.209
Your Highness, this is no small matter.

01:30:35.209 --> 01:30:37.793
His Majesty falling into the water
wasn't a coincidence.

01:30:38.584 --> 01:30:40.376
Master Guo was involved.

01:30:40.751 --> 01:30:42.001
If, by chance,

01:30:42.001 --> 01:30:43.876
this matter isn't handled properly,

01:30:43.876 --> 01:30:47.376
Your Highness will be in big trouble.

01:30:52.584 --> 01:30:54.209
Your Excellency, please save me.

01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:59.876
Your Highness,

01:30:59.876 --> 01:31:01.626
This problem, it's not so difficult.

01:31:02.209 --> 01:31:04.876
We just need to remove Lu from the picture,

01:31:05.376 --> 01:31:07.876
along with the other insiders,

01:31:08.501 --> 01:31:13.418
including your girlfriend.

01:31:36.459 --> 01:31:37.918
From now on,

01:31:39.168 --> 01:31:41.793
I will follow the advice
of Your Excellency on all matters.

01:31:46.209 --> 01:31:48.793
Please do not praise me more
than I deserve.

01:31:49.293 --> 01:31:51.001
My concern is

01:31:51.501 --> 01:31:54.459
His Majesty is very ill.

01:31:54.876 --> 01:31:57.001
If something happens,

01:31:57.959 --> 01:32:02.918
who do Your Highness think would
be the successor?

01:32:04.251 --> 01:32:06.043
This is too important of a matter.

01:32:06.834 --> 01:32:08.334
I dare not speak a word.

01:32:09.334 --> 01:32:11.459
Everything shall be decided by
Your Excellency.

01:32:18.876 --> 01:32:22.668
Recently, His Majesty has been
speaking of you.

01:32:25.043 --> 01:32:27.293
I wager Your Highness will be called

01:32:27.293 --> 01:32:29.459
into His Majesty's chamber in the
upcoming days.

01:32:33.001 --> 01:32:35.251
My sincerest gratitude, Your Excellency.

01:32:40.418 --> 01:32:41.751
Shen,

01:32:41.751 --> 01:32:43.251
they'll be expecting us to go by water.

01:32:48.751 --> 01:32:50.376
Let's land at Liaocheng,

01:32:51.084 --> 01:32:52.459
then take a detour east around Jinan,

01:32:52.459 --> 01:32:53.543
and head to Yi Mountain.

01:32:54.459 --> 01:32:56.418
That's where we can easily
evade the pursuing troops.

01:32:56.959 --> 01:32:58.501
troops?

01:32:59.293 --> 01:33:01.334
Sent by Prince Xin?

01:33:02.626 --> 01:33:05.251
You lied to her.

01:33:06.293 --> 01:33:09.001
We can find a boat at Weihai.

01:33:09.418 --> 01:33:11.043
Once we're out at sea,

01:33:11.043 --> 01:33:12.334
we can go anywhere we want.

01:33:12.334 --> 01:33:13.959
Once we get to Weihai,

01:33:13.959 --> 01:33:15.584
we part ways.

01:33:58.959 --> 01:34:00.918
It's so hot.

01:34:02.209 --> 01:34:04.918
Sweating will help you recover.

01:34:07.126 --> 01:34:08.793
You made me drink

01:34:08.793 --> 01:34:10.376
four bowls of hot water,

01:34:10.376 --> 01:34:12.543
and made me sit next to the fire.

01:34:12.834 --> 01:34:14.251
How can I not be hot?

01:34:14.751 --> 01:34:16.376
I blew on the water,

01:34:16.376 --> 01:34:17.876
how could it be hot?

01:34:25.084 --> 01:34:27.043
Where will you go

01:34:27.043 --> 01:34:29.168
after all this?

01:34:30.751 --> 01:34:32.209
Hangzhou.

01:34:34.918 --> 01:34:36.293
Hangzhou.

01:34:37.168 --> 01:34:39.126
Good choice.

01:34:54.959 --> 01:34:56.751
Pei?

01:35:11.668 --> 01:35:13.251
I'm sorry.

01:35:18.793 --> 01:35:19.584
They've entered the village.

01:35:19.584 --> 01:35:21.334
Too many to count. I killed two.

01:35:21.334 --> 01:35:22.376
It's Lu.

01:35:22.751 --> 01:35:24.501
The Windstorm, variable,

01:35:24.501 --> 01:35:26.293
sweeps up the common and the noble,

01:35:26.293 --> 01:35:28.001
life and death are inevitable,

01:35:28.001 --> 01:35:29.918
and doom is unavoidable.

01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:43.751
We must leave.

01:35:45.126 --> 01:35:46.376
Split up.

01:36:24.043 --> 01:36:24.876
Watch out!

01:36:48.751 --> 01:36:50.418
Die!

01:37:18.001 --> 01:37:18.876
Come on.

01:37:19.418 --> 01:37:20.293
Come on.

01:37:28.168 --> 01:37:29.293
Come on, you bastard.

01:37:43.876 --> 01:37:45.084
The horses won't go on the bridge.

01:37:45.084 --> 01:37:47.959
Without horses, they'll catch up to us.

01:37:59.168 --> 01:37:59.918
Once you cross this bridge,

01:37:59.918 --> 01:38:01.584
you'll be out of Yi Mountain in a day.

01:38:02.459 --> 01:38:03.459
Pei,

01:38:03.876 --> 01:38:05.126
you take Bei Zhai to Weihai.

01:38:05.751 --> 01:38:07.043
Wait for me there.

01:38:07.043 --> 01:38:08.251
I'm not leaving.

01:38:08.834 --> 01:38:10.209
Lu stabbed me with his blade.

01:38:10.209 --> 01:38:11.668
I must repay him.

01:38:13.001 --> 01:38:14.709
I'm not leaving by myself.

01:38:15.251 --> 01:38:16.876
I'm staying.

01:38:20.126 --> 01:38:22.459
You'll jeopardize us if you stay.

01:38:22.459 --> 01:38:24.084
Aren't you waiting for Prince Xin to
come for you?

01:38:24.084 --> 01:38:25.959
Stay alive.

01:38:28.626 --> 01:38:29.751
Go.

01:38:30.251 --> 01:38:31.501
Go!

01:38:40.251 --> 01:38:41.584
Miao Xuan.

01:38:46.501 --> 01:38:49.834
My name is Miao Xuan.

01:38:57.043 --> 01:38:58.209
I will remember it.

01:39:12.251 --> 01:39:13.209
They're down there!

01:39:13.209 --> 01:39:15.876
Charge!

01:39:17.418 --> 01:39:20.293
Charge!

01:39:40.334 --> 01:39:41.376
Pei,

01:39:41.376 --> 01:39:43.043
guard the bridge.

01:39:43.043 --> 01:39:43.918
You got it.

01:40:14.959 --> 01:40:16.834
The woman has crossed the bridge.

01:40:21.084 --> 01:40:24.209
Charge!

01:40:48.251 --> 01:40:49.668
Bring it on!

01:42:17.168 --> 01:42:18.001
Shen Lian!

01:43:03.834 --> 01:43:04.834
Brother Lu!

01:43:30.668 --> 01:43:32.084
Colonel,

01:43:32.959 --> 01:43:36.126
we're even.

01:43:41.501 --> 01:43:42.543
Brother Lu!

01:43:43.334 --> 01:43:44.584
It's okay.

01:43:45.251 --> 01:43:46.751
It's just a minor wound.

01:43:47.376 --> 01:43:48.793
Master Ding,

01:43:48.793 --> 01:43:50.084
enough.

01:43:50.459 --> 01:43:51.501
You two may go.

01:43:54.626 --> 01:43:55.876
Shen Lian,

01:43:56.376 --> 01:43:57.876
you underestimate me.

01:43:58.251 --> 01:44:00.043
I must kill you all,

01:44:00.209 --> 01:44:02.626
or I'll be ashamed to face Prince Xin.

01:44:03.834 --> 01:44:05.126
You don't have to do this.

01:44:05.959 --> 01:44:07.084
Is this really worth it?

01:44:07.626 --> 01:44:08.793
How can you change the regime,

01:44:08.793 --> 01:44:10.293
when you can't even let a woman live?

01:44:12.084 --> 01:44:14.626
Shen Lian, don't you understand?

01:44:16.959 --> 01:44:19.126
At my age'

01:44:19.126 --> 01:44:20.376
friendship

01:44:21.293 --> 01:44:22.543
and integrity

01:44:23.376 --> 01:44:24.834
have all been worn down.

01:44:25.501 --> 01:44:27.918
If I don't hold onto something,

01:44:28.501 --> 01:44:31.584
I'm no different from a corpse.

01:44:47.043 --> 01:44:48.334
Watch out!

01:44:50.834 --> 01:44:51.918
Go.

01:44:53.418 --> 01:44:54.501
Go.

01:45:04.501 --> 01:45:05.751
Fire!

01:45:06.126 --> 01:45:07.876
None of them leaves here alive.

01:45:08.001 --> 01:45:09.501
Bring me their bodies for a reward.

01:45:09.501 --> 01:45:10.751
Fire!

01:45:19.001 --> 01:45:20.543
Your Highness,

01:45:23.251 --> 01:45:25.543
His Majesty calls.

01:45:37.209 --> 01:45:38.418
Sister,

01:45:38.918 --> 01:45:40.459
I don't understand.

01:45:41.043 --> 01:45:43.043
Brother, don't you see?

01:45:44.418 --> 01:45:46.043
For His Highness,

01:45:48.126 --> 01:45:50.001
we are both loose ends.

01:45:59.959 --> 01:46:01.626
Shen Lian!

01:46:04.043 --> 01:46:08.459
We're both destined to die
on this battlefield.

01:46:32.959 --> 01:46:34.376
Lu!

01:47:09.209 --> 01:47:10.501
Shen Lian!

01:47:13.918 --> 01:47:15.251
Go get her!

01:47:15.709 --> 01:47:17.918
Don't let her get away!

01:47:25.418 --> 01:47:26.834
Leave!

01:47:31.626 --> 01:47:33.126
Go!

01:47:36.876 --> 01:47:38.376
Get out of here!

01:47:39.126 --> 01:47:40.834
Come any closer and I'll kill you.

01:47:47.459 --> 01:47:48.751
What are you waiting for?

01:49:19.209 --> 01:49:21.876
Come closer.

01:49:24.126 --> 01:49:26.668
Your Majesty, please take care of yourself.

01:49:27.918 --> 01:49:29.668
Dear brother,

01:49:30.334 --> 01:49:32.584
the Empire of the Great Ming is now yours.

01:49:34.501 --> 01:49:36.251
And you

01:49:38.418 --> 01:49:40.293
shall devote yourself to it.

01:49:51.209 --> 01:49:52.543
What am I doing?

01:49:53.251 --> 01:49:54.876
Why am I risking my life

01:49:55.584 --> 01:49:57.334
in a place like this?

01:49:58.334 --> 01:49:59.918
To be born in times like these,

01:50:00.209 --> 01:50:01.501
did I have a choice?

01:50:02.709 --> 01:50:05.668
The way I live now,

01:50:06.251 --> 01:50:07.751
living just to survive,

01:50:08.001 --> 01:50:09.459
is no longer bearable.

01:50:48.626 --> 01:50:52.584
Shen Lian.

01:50:53.709 --> 01:50:55.251
Shen Lian.

01:51:25.251 --> 01:51:27.251
His Majesty has passed and gone to heaven.

01:51:27.251 --> 01:51:29.376
Before his departure,

01:51:29.376 --> 01:51:32.668
he appointed me as his successor.

01:51:32.668 --> 01:51:35.043
I am extremely humbled

01:51:35.043 --> 01:51:36.626
to accept this extraordinary honor.

01:51:36.626 --> 01:51:37.876
Despite of my fear of
taking such great responsibility,

01:51:37.876 --> 01:51:39.376
I have been given tremendous support

01:51:39.376 --> 01:51:41.126
from the people and the nobles.

01:51:41.668 --> 01:51:43.584
I shall not betray their trust.

01:51:44.126 --> 01:51:45.751
Therefore,

01:51:45.751 --> 01:51:47.543
on this very day,

01:51:48.501 --> 01:51:50.251
I declare my accession to the throne.

01:51:53.293 --> 01:51:55.293
Your Majesty,

01:51:56.084 --> 01:51:59.918
here is the list of convicts
to be executed after autumn.

01:52:11.126 --> 01:52:14.001
Your Excellency should go home and rest.

01:52:14.376 --> 01:52:16.376
But I am not tired.

01:52:17.251 --> 01:52:18.876
I insist.

01:52:20.126 --> 01:52:22.376
From now on,

01:52:23.001 --> 01:52:25.168
I will lead the council
to handle all government affairs.

01:52:25.168 --> 01:52:27.668
Your Excellency need not be concerned.

01:52:47.376 --> 01:52:49.834
Three months later, the Emperor
removed Wei Zhongxian from court,

01:52:49.834 --> 01:52:51.626
and banished him to Fengyang to
be a grave keeper.

01:52:51.626 --> 01:52:53.418
Wei died on the journey.

01:52:53.834 --> 01:52:57.751
The following year,
the Emperor titled his reign "Chongzhen"

01:53:25.543 --> 01:53:26.834
ls it time?

01:53:27.334 --> 01:53:28.668
Congratulations, Your Honor.

01:53:29.334 --> 01:53:31.459
Please report for duty
at the Northern Bureau tomorrow.

01:53:32.168 --> 01:53:33.459
All captain positions are full.

01:53:33.709 --> 01:53:36.334
You will be a lieutenant, for now.

01:54:01.251 --> 01:54:05.001
Outside Hangzhou

01:59:26.668 --> 01:59:27.834
You're lucky.

01:59:27.959 --> 01:59:29.876
If my little brother were here,

01:59:29.876 --> 01:59:31.876
he'd use his twin blades to...

01:59:33.626 --> 01:59:35.876
Twin blades. Yes, I know him!

01:59:36.043 --> 01:59:37.334
His name is not Ding Xian.

01:59:37.876 --> 01:59:39.084
It's Jin Yichuan.

01:59:39.834 --> 01:59:41.043
A squad leader in the Imperial Guard.

01:59:41.043 --> 01:59:42.168
Jin Yichuan.

01:59:53.709 --> 01:59:55.709
Jin Yichuan.
