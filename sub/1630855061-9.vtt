[ chuckles ]
looking at you now,

18:40.487 --> 18:43.322
I see that you need
a little touch-up.

18:46.359 --> 18:47.959
Nurse, scalpel.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.828
Still tied up
over here.
Right.

18:49.830 --> 18:53.364
I don't care how obsessed
you are with me,

18:53.366 --> 18:55.300
You can't have my family.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.635
You don't get it.

18:56.637 --> 18:59.438
I don't want to<i> have</i>
your family.

18:59.440 --> 19:00.906
I want to<i> ruin</i> them,

19:00.908 --> 19:03.409
Just like you ruined
my whole life.

19:13.254 --> 19:15.386
[ panting ]

19:15.388 --> 19:16.988
Watch the face.
Watch the face.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.458
Obviously, it's mine.

19:19.460 --> 19:22.527
How dare you try to change
my family.

19:22.529 --> 19:25.130
Let me tell you,
as a plastic surgeon,

19:25.132 --> 19:27.933
Your family
is far from perfect.

19:27.935 --> 19:29.000
You bitch.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.536
Maybe they're not
perfect to you,

19:31.538 --> 19:34.405
But I love them all
as they are --

19:34.407 --> 19:35.741
Medium-looking.

19:35.743 --> 19:40.412
Except my wife,
she's a [bleep] fox!

19:48.021 --> 19:50.956
Time to face the music.

19:50.958 --> 19:53.158
[ groaning ]

19:53.160 --> 19:54.760
I'm so sorry.

19:54.762 --> 19:57.096
When I said I love
and accept you as you are,

19:57.098 --> 19:59.564
I realized maybe that's what
I've been worried about

19:59.566 --> 20:00.765
This whole time.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.701
That once
I'm past my peak

20:02.703 --> 20:04.903
You might not love
and accept me.

20:04.905 --> 20:05.771
Just untie us.

20:05.773 --> 20:07.572
Hold on,
I'm not quite done.

20:07.574 --> 20:11.576
I realize now, though,
you'll never give up on me.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.312
On good ol' stan.

20:13.314 --> 20:15.380
Uch, take it off.
Jee-zuss.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.550
[ moans ]
get a bucket and a mop.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.387
Whew!
Glad that's over.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.055
Wait,<i> is</i> it over?

20:24.057 --> 20:26.325
Hopefully dr. Kalgary
can squeeze me in today.

20:26.327 --> 20:27.526
Although,
I do like carrying around

20:27.528 --> 20:30.261
This big 'ole
flappy face.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.462
Stan.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.699
Come on,
I'm kissing your ass.

20:35.402 --> 20:36.935
Someone stop that apple.

20:36.937 --> 20:38.470
Roger?

20:38.472 --> 20:41.206
Whoa,
look at your face, dude.

20:41.208 --> 20:42.675
What happened to you?

20:43.944 --> 20:45.210
Hey.

20:45.212 --> 20:46.612
That's a $4 apple.

20:52.953 --> 20:55.688
What am I doing?
I'll just go buy another one.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.958
Bye! Have a beautiful time!
