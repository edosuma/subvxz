want you back?

12:07.144 --> 12:10.011
You know, theyjust think
that my experience
as an FBI. agent...

12:10.105 --> 12:12.016
and a sniper
in the first Gulf War—

12:12.107 --> 12:16.476
You could train soldiers
in techniques for tracking
and apprehending insurgents.

12:16.570 --> 12:20.404
Yeah. Well, I’m real happy
tracking and catching
murderers right here.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.742
- They say you could save lives.
- Course they’re gonna say it.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.566
It’s the army. They say that
’cause that’s what they want.

12:24.661 --> 12:25.946
You don’t think you’d save lives?

12:26.038 --> 12:28.245
Yeah, but, I mean,
anyone would in that position.

12:28.332 --> 12:29.822
Not everybody
is as good as you.

12:29.917 --> 12:32.954
I served my country.
l have a kid here.
I got responsibilities.

12:33.045 --> 12:36.162
I’m not gonna go to Afghanistan,
and you’re not gonna go
to the Makapoopoo Islands.

12:38.634 --> 12:41.626
You know what?
We have ourjobs here, right?

12:44.097 --> 12:46.008
Yeah.

12:49.353 --> 12:52.095
[ Daisy]
Excuse me. Dr. Brennan,
if I could just have a moment?

12:52.189 --> 12:55.022
And I’d like to preface
my statement with a caveat.

12:55.150 --> 12:58.267
Your unquestionable
brilliance—
What is it, Ms. Wick?

12:58.362 --> 13:02.696
Okay, okay. ln-ln
your preliminary report,
you said the injuries...

13:02.783 --> 13:07.698
to the temporal and parietal
bones and squamosal suture
were inflicted at time of death.

13:07.788 --> 13:09.119
That’s correct.

13:09.206 --> 13:11.697
“That” meaning what I said
or “that” meaning what you said?

13:11.833 --> 13:14.040
I’ll read what
you wrote verbatim.
That’s not necessary.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.958
“There are apparent
perimortem injuries...

13:16.046 --> 13:18.253
to the temporal and parietal
bones and squamosal suture.”

13:18.340 --> 13:19.876
That sounds correct.

13:19.967 --> 13:23.880
How angry would you be
if it were not correct?

13:23.971 --> 13:25.381
You mean
if I were wrong.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.589
I would never state it
in those kind of bald terms.

13:28.684 --> 13:31.300
Does “inaccurate”
sound better? No.

13:31.395 --> 13:33.852
- Um, erroneous?
- What have you found, Ms. Wick?

13:33.939 --> 13:36.396
You’ll know instantly
when I point it out.

13:38.652 --> 13:43.112
Here and here,
under 40 times magnification.

13:43.198 --> 13:47.316
Remodeling.
The wounds started to heal
before the victim died.

13:47.411 --> 13:49.993
Which means we have
no clear cause of death.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.823
And even after your
superlative recommendation,
I am stumped.

13:53.917 --> 13:57.125
Please conduct
a histological study
of the bones.

13:57.212 --> 14:01.922
Yes, yes, of course.
May I ask why you
want to do that?

14:02.009 --> 14:04.591
There’s something funny
about the way these bones feel.

14:04.678 --> 14:08.546
- Bones have a feel?
- Yes. Touch them.

14:08.640 --> 14:12.974
Compare them kinetically
to the thousands of other
bones you’ve examined.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.894
Lighter. Oh, my God, yes.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.807
| wish you were coming
to Maluku.

14:21.236 --> 14:23.818
It seems odd
that you’d be missing
something so important.

14:23.905 --> 14:25.611
The histological study,
Ms. Wick.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.032
[Brennan ]
The vict/m ’s apartment
is like an archaeological d/g.

14:33.123 --> 14:36.286
We should be able
to put together a picture
of his life from his effects.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.662
Hodgins is dating
each pile ofjunk,

14:38.754 --> 14:43.088
according to
insect larvae, rat droppings
and the yellowing of the paper.

14:43.175 --> 14:45.757
Apparently,
he’s been hoarding stuff
for about four years.

14:45.844 --> 14:48.085
The oldest stuff is where
he fell through the ceiling.

14:48.180 --> 14:52.549
Hoarders often
organize their holdings
by category and value,

14:52.642 --> 14:54.473
much like one would find
in a museum.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.847
Oh, so he was
curating garbage?

14:56.938 --> 14:58.894
Well, the term “garbage”
is relative.

14:58.982 --> 15:02.065
The only intrinsic value
things have is what
we give them.

15:02.152 --> 15:05.269
It seems odd now,
but in Holland,

15:05.363 --> 15:07.740
tulip bulbs were once
as valuable as houses.

15:09.951 --> 15:14.115
Maybe we all overvalue things
that are essentially worthless.

15:15.373 --> 15:17.659
Well, that was more than
a comment on this case.

15:20.212 --> 15:22.749
What’s goin’ on, Brennan?

15:22.839 --> 15:26.127
What separates
what I do here
from what this man did?

15:26.218 --> 15:29.585
Okay. So going to Malulu
is worth more?

15:29.679 --> 15:31.806
Maluku. Yes.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.755
The murders wﬂl
ne ver stop,

15:33.850 --> 15:36.637
but this find
has real finite value.

l ’d be able
to answer questions about
our or/gin, evolutionary track.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.848
It has implications
for history, science.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.934
Listen—

15:45.028 --> 15:49.237
You’re allowed to make
life changes without picking
a fight with your old life.

15:49.324 --> 15:52.191
But I need a break
from that life.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.867
I’m worried all the time.

15:54.955 --> 15:58.664
Worried that Booth
might get hurt on a case
and I couldn’t prevent it.

15:58.750 --> 16:02.663
Worried about what
our partnership means.

16:02.754 --> 16:05.086
So you want to get away
from Booth?

16:05.173 --> 16:07.334
No. It’s just—

16:10.053 --> 16:14.797
| just need some perspective
so that I can view my life
with some objectivity.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.882
Have you talked
to him about it?

16:19.896 --> 16:22.353
The army wants Booth
to go to Afghanistan,

16:22.440 --> 16:25.477
to train soldiers
in the apprehension of terrorists.

16:25.569 --> 16:27.150
Is he gonna go?

16:27.237 --> 16:30.570
Even though he said he wasn’t,
it felt like he wanted to.

16:32.242 --> 16:33.857
Perhaps it’s all
for the best.

16:33.952 --> 16:37.319
[ Scoffs ]
You two at opposite ends
of the world?

16:37.414 --> 16:39.370
[Chuckles]
I don’t— I don’t think so.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.197
We have work to do, Angela.

16:41.293 --> 16:44.456
Traditionally, hoarders have
one section of possessions...

16:44.546 --> 16:46.502
that has a greater value
than the others.

16:46.590 --> 16:48.672
We should be looking for that.

16:51.761 --> 16:55.345
Where did you learn how to throw
a fastball like that, huh?

16:55.432 --> 16:57.047
- You were amazing.
- You taught me.

16:57.142 --> 17:00.760
No. No, hey,
I’m not that good.
Right? Yeah.

17:01.479 --> 17:02.639

Yeah.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.346
Are you going back
to be a soldier?

17:04.441 --> 17:07.353
Uh, why are you
asking me that?

17:07.444 --> 17:10.151
Mom said the army called
our house looking for you.

17:10.238 --> 17:13.526
I’m not in the army anymore.
Bub, I’m out, okay?

17:13.617 --> 17:17.326
I made a decision to stay
with the FBI. to be
with you all the time.

17:17.412 --> 17:21.872
- So it’s my fault?
- Is what your fault?

17:21.958 --> 17:23.994
It’s my fault
people are gonna die.

17:24.085 --> 17:25.871
No, that’s not what I meant.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.702
I want you to save lives.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.503
Yeah, well,
I do that here.

17:29.591 --> 17:32.708
No. Here, you catch people
that kill other people.

17:32.802 --> 17:35.418
There, you would make it
so people wouldn’t die.

17:36.765 --> 17:39.302
Isn’t that better?

17:40.477 --> 17:43.344
It was just a phone call,
buddy. That’s all.

17:43.438 --> 17:45.895

I got an even better idea.

17:45.982 --> 17:49.895

go get one of those huge,
giant root beer floats...

17:49.986 --> 17:51.567

17:51.655 --> 17:53.441
Sure.
Yeah!

17:53.531 --> 17:55.658
All right.
Give me five, kid.

Where are the Maluku Islands?

18:06.962 --> 18:10.546
Formally known
as the Spice Islands,
indicating they smell very good.

18:10.632 --> 18:14.375
There are earthquakes
and volcanoes and a number
of venomous creatures.

18:14.469 --> 18:18.007
- What about our wedding?
- We could elope
in the Maluku Islands.

18:18.098 --> 18:21.010
Oh, okay. What then?
What would I do there?

18:22.227 --> 18:24.934
I know this isn’t
easy for you, Lancelot.

18:25.021 --> 18:28.730

to be difficult for you.

neatly put away.

that turned him into a hoarder

It’s simple receivables, cash receipts.
It’s office supplies mostly.

to the recycling bin each quarter.

in Tim Murphy’s apartment.

23:15.562 --> 23:16.893
You’re right.

23:16.980 --> 23:19.767
So,uh,doofs
probably pried open.

23:19.857 --> 23:22.109
So, a robbery—
motive for murder.

23:22.193 --> 23:25.230
Hoarder has an actual treasure.
Someone wants it. He won’t sell.

23:25.321 --> 23:27.937
He’s robbed, murdered.
Yeah, it fits.

23:28.032 --> 23:30.774
I don’t think it’s possible
to tell if anything
got stolen from this place.

23:30.868 --> 23:34.656
So Daisy’s going to Indonesia.
She doesn’t really
care if I go with her.

23:34.789 --> 23:37.872
Ooh, ouch.
Sweets—

23:37.959 --> 23:41.372
[ Chuckling ]
No offense, but you might
be better off without her.

23:41.462 --> 23:44.829
Dr. Brennan was asked to head up
the expedition. Will you
be better off without her?

23:44.924 --> 23:46.460
- Excuse me?
- Daisy told me.

23:46.551 --> 23:48.667
No, Bones is not
going anywhere.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.297
[ Hodgins ]
if it’s any consolation,

23:50.388 --> 23:53.551
Angela’s dad got cheated out
of his car in a card game
with some bikers,

23:53.683 --> 23:56.345
and he wants me
to steal it back.
How’s that any consolation?

23:56.436 --> 23:58.176
Ah, tra va/ls d’amour;
mes amis.

23:58.271 --> 24:00.227
The things we do for love.

24:00.315 --> 24:02.977
Great. You guys stay here,
see if this guy’s got anything
in here worth 50 grand.

24:03.067 --> 24:04.932
You understand?

24:06.279 --> 24:08.770
So, uh, I’ll help you
get that car back.

24:08.865 --> 24:10.275
Really?

24:10.366 --> 24:11.981
Yeah. You know why?

24:12.076 --> 24:13.452
’Cause I’m Mr. Adventure.

24:13.536 --> 24:16.403
I’d rather you were Mr. Sneaky
Ninja Killer Assassin,

24:16.497 --> 24:19.785
but, hey, a guy can’t be picky
in this sidekick market, huh?

24:19.876 --> 24:21.366
Nope.

24:21.461 --> 24:24.794
The Raman spectroscope uses
lasers and light diffusion...

24:24.881 --> 24:27.998
to measure minute changes
in chemical composition.

24:28.092 --> 24:30.834
This machine
would be very useful
on Maluku Islands.

24:30.928 --> 24:33.135
I’ve already suggested it
to the organizers.

24:33.222 --> 24:36.714
- So you’re coming?
- Agent Booth and l are partners.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.720
l have to discuss it
with him first.

24:38.811 --> 24:42.679
- Well, he’s probably gonna go
be a big hero in Afghanistan.
- He says he doesn’t want to go.

24:42.774 --> 24:45.060
Lance said that Booth
has the psyche
of a true warrior.

24:45.151 --> 24:48.643
That it’s a miracle
he hasn’t gone back
long before this.

24:48.738 --> 24:51.525
Maybe you’re holding
him back the same way
he’s holding you back.

24:53.451 --> 24:55.567
I shouldn’t have said that.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.778
But sometimes my mouth
just has a mouth of its own.

24:57.872 --> 25:01.615
We have to determine
the precise day
the victim was struck.

25:01.709 --> 25:05.748
Da y of attack,
not the day of death.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.045
Yeah. How?

25:08.132 --> 25:12.796
I want you to measure
the amount of remodeling
that occurred since the attack.

25:12.887 --> 25:16.675
Oh, my God! That’s genius.
You have to come to Maluku.

25:16.766 --> 25:18.472
You don’t want me
being honored...

25:18.559 --> 25:20.470
by the National Society
of Anthropologists
without you, do you?

25:20.561 --> 25:22.973
Remodeling, Ms. Wick.

25:25.066 --> 25:29.935
Okay. What I did was modify
my mass-recognition program,
patent pending,

25:30.029 --> 25:33.021
to scan the photographic reconstruction
of the crime scene...

25:33.116 --> 25:36.028
to find areas
of comparatively less chaos.

25:36.119 --> 25:37.575
Awesome.

25:37.662 --> 25:39.198
You understand
what she’s saying?

25:39.288 --> 25:42.872
Not in the least.
But I’m so turned on
by her brain.

25:42.959 --> 25:44.495
l’d l/ke to see
her brain total/y naked

25:44.585 --> 25:46.871
[ Sweets ]
it’s a terrible image.
it’s just terr/b/e.

25:46.963 --> 25:48.624
[A ngela ]
Okay Sweets,
you’ll understand this.

25:48.715 --> 25:51.707
We have a hoarder.
We also have
a possible intruder.

25:51.801 --> 25:54.213
The intruder comes in
to look for something.

25:54.303 --> 25:56.339
Okay. Stacks of—

25:56.472 --> 25:59.054
Crap.
Crap grow organically,
in a way.

25:59.142 --> 26:02.305
But if someone
came in and disturbed
the hoarder’s system,

26:02.395 --> 26:04.556
then put everything back,
it would look different.

26:04.647 --> 26:07.980
- It doesn’t look different.
- Well, it does to my program.

26:09.152 --> 26:10.483
There.

26:10.570 --> 26:14.154
Okay, now somebody,
not the victim,
rearranged that pile.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.776
Okay, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where?

26:15.867 --> 26:17.858
[A nge/a ]
So you’re gonna go
towards the window.

26:17.952 --> 26:19.112
Okay.

26:19.203 --> 26:20.909
[ Hodgins ]
Window.

26:26.502 --> 26:27.662
Now turn right.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.995
[ Hodgins ]
Right.

26:30.089 --> 26:33.081
You’re getting warmer.
Warmer.

26:33.176 --> 26:34.461
To the left.

26:36.763 --> 26:39.300
[ Beeping ]
Okay, there. There.

26:39.390 --> 26:43.383
Does anything
look strange ?
Anything missing ?

26:43.478 --> 26:46.936
Yes. There are
silverfish eggs here.

26:47.023 --> 26:50.607
So something was
on top of these eggs that
prevented them from hatching.

26:50.693 --> 26:54.026
I’ll take some samples
and figure out
exactly what it was.

26:55.782 --> 26:59.650
So, Bones, here we are.
What’s all the mystery about?

26:59.744 --> 27:03.157
I’ve been offered
the chance to head up
the Maluku Island project.

27:03.247 --> 27:08.116
Yeah, I heard.
Daisy told Sweets,
and Sweets told me.

27:08.211 --> 27:11.954
Oh. I’d like to accept.

27:12.048 --> 27:14.664
Hmm. lthought
you already had,
you know?

27:15.718 --> 27:17.458
We’ve been partners
for five years, Booth.

27:17.553 --> 27:20.010
I wouldn’t make
a decision like this
without talking to you.

27:20.097 --> 27:22.759
Bones, look, you don’t need
my permission, okay?
It’s cool.

27:22.850 --> 27:25.057
You say that,
but you won’t look at me.

27:25.144 --> 27:28.978
You’re the one who
taught me the value
of making eye contact.

27:30.233 --> 27:31.894
So, please?

27:35.071 --> 27:36.561
I’m sorry.

27:36.656 --> 27:41.741
ljust— I don’t do really good
with change, I guess.

27:41.828 --> 27:44.240
You’re better than I am.

27:44.330 --> 27:47.822
Pyramids are better
at change than you are.

27:47.917 --> 27:49.453
It’s a joke.
I was being affectionate.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.325
Ohh.
[Chuckles]

27:51.420 --> 27:53.035
Will you go back
to the army?

27:53.130 --> 27:55.291
It’s what’s best
for me right now.

27:55.383 --> 27:57.214
I’ll only be gone
for a year.

27:57.301 --> 27:59.883
Yeah, me too.
So, hey, what’s a year?

27:59.971 --> 28:03.338
It’s the time it takes
the Earth to make a full
revolution around the sun.

28:03.432 --> 28:05.138
In the scheme of things,

28:05.268 --> 28:08.180
you know, the grand scheme,
just saying a year is just—
Oh.

28:08.271 --> 28:09.511
it’s not too bad.

28:09.647 --> 28:11.808
Right.
Right?

28:11.899 --> 28:13.935
We can come back,
pick up where we left off.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.562
Nothing really has to change.

28:15.653 --> 28:18.110
No, things have to change.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.688
You know what? Hey.

28:20.783 --> 28:24.150
I taught you about eye contact.
You taught me about evolution.

28:24.245 --> 28:27.737
So, here’s to change.

28:29.292 --> 28:31.123
To change.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.546
So here’s what
you got so far?

28:41.637 --> 28:43.548
A crazy hoarder
got knocked down,

28:43.639 --> 28:45.379
buried alive
under his own hoardings,

28:45.474 --> 28:48.261
by a robber,
who stole something
that maybe killed bugs,

28:48.352 --> 28:50.684
then the hoarder died
a little while later,

28:50.771 --> 28:53.262
then fell through the ceiling
of the apartment downstairs.

28:53.357 --> 28:55.894
- It sounds better in my report.
- Which raises the question—

28:55.985 --> 28:59.273
You usually add a little spice
to your reports when you know
your case is weak.

28:59.363 --> 29:00.739
There was no question
in there.

29:00.823 --> 29:03.610
It was implied.
Connect the dots.

29:05.870 --> 29:07.406
[ Softly ]
All right.

29:14.670 --> 29:17.082
Aren’t you a little old
to go out fighting wars?

29:17.173 --> 29:18.788
I’m not going to be fighting.

29:18.883 --> 29:22.967
I’m just going to be training
soldiers to investigate,
pursue and detain.

29:23.054 --> 29:27.013
I guess that answers my next
question as to whether or not
you intend to go.

29:28.684 --> 29:30.345
What about your partner?

29:30.436 --> 29:32.427
Bones, she’s going
to Indonesia.
You know what?

29:32.521 --> 29:35.604
Maybe it’s time to find
another, you know, F.B.l. guy
and a forensic anthropologist.

29:35.691 --> 29:38.774
Yes. On account of
you’re both so replaceable.

29:38.861 --> 29:41.318
[ Sighs ]
You got to act
like a big boy on this one.

29:41.405 --> 29:44.863
- You don’t want me to go?
- Nope. You go, you stay.
That’s up to you.

29:44.951 --> 29:47.283
But before you go,
you clear this case.

29:47.370 --> 29:50.328
Notjust dress up nothing
in a nice report.

29:55.795 --> 29:58.457
I took the unhatched
silverfish eggs,
made a milk shake...

29:58.547 --> 30:00.208
and ran it through
the mass spec.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.960
To find out
what poisoned them?

30:02.051 --> 30:03.837
Not poisoned,
but rendered infertile.

30:03.970 --> 30:07.337
Suggesting chemical
agents or radiation.
Radiation.

30:07.431 --> 30:09.387
What I found were
phyllosilicate minerals,

30:09.475 --> 30:11.807
along with some
interesting metal oxides,

30:11.894 --> 30:16.479
very small traces
of vitrified clay
and uranium-235.

30:16.565 --> 30:18.146
So an atomic bomb?

30:18.234 --> 30:21.351
No, something much more
interesting than that.

30:24.281 --> 30:27.614
- An atomic gnome?
- Basically, yeah.

30:27.702 --> 30:31.536
This is the Fiesta Ware
Christmas Gnome, circa 1941.

30:31.622 --> 30:34.739
Now the uranium was
a common ingredient
in the glaze on these gnomes...

30:34.834 --> 30:36.950
until the Second World War,

30:37.044 --> 30:40.286
when all production of the red
Fiesta Ware gnome was halted.

30:40.423 --> 30:45.713
The victim claimed he possessed
something worth $50,000.
How much is the gnome worth?

30:45.803 --> 30:47.794
[Typing ]

30:50.016 --> 30:51.552
$50,000.

30:51.642 --> 30:53.303
We have our motive.

30:53.394 --> 30:57.137
Now we just have to find
the person who collects
radioactive Hobbits.

31:18.627 --> 31:20.208
This is
pretty extreme, man.

Because I’ve got a father-in-law

31:37.396 --> 31:38.897
You mind
turning him around?

31:38.981 --> 31:40.972
Why? Why, because the gnome
knows what you did...

31:41.067 --> 31:43.604
and you don’t
like him staring at you
with his soulful little eyes?

31:43.736 --> 31:46.523
How do you even know
that’s my gnome?
We found it in your basement.

31:46.614 --> 31:50.027
- Someone planted it there.
- Why?

31:50.117 --> 31:53.655
Because I’m a well-known
aficionado and purveyor
of Fiesta Ware.

31:53.746 --> 31:55.702
So the phone records indicate...

31:55.790 --> 32:01.035
that you called Mr. Murphy
several times during the days
leading up to his death.

message board...

for 12 bucks.

if he’d sell.

32:10.429 --> 32:13.637
Mm-hmm. Last time
you contacted him
was on April 29.

32:13.724 --> 32:16.466
The day he was assaulted.
So you have an alibi for that?

32:16.560 --> 32:19.927
I went to talk to him.
I was gonna give him 50 grand.

32:20.022 --> 32:24.015
I mean, he didn’t even
appreciate the gnome.
He was insane.

with a kitchen knife or a machete?

32:27.321 --> 32:29.733
No. No, he saw.

32:29.824 --> 32:33.157
I pushed the guy,
and I took the gnome.
That’s all.

to answer, Rocky?

32:35.579 --> 32:37.615

anyway.
