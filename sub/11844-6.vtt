02:16.569 --> 02:19.061
If Courtney's a Skin, that means
she was working with Whitaker.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.234
You're right. There's no way two Skins would
just happen to be in Roswell at the same time.

Look, if Courtney is a Skin,

How could she be in

04:23.696 --> 04:26.393
So who's conveniently
covering up her death for us?

of Congresswoman Whitaker.</i>

15:53.552 --> 15:56.249
Before we leave town,
we'd like to pay respects to the family.

15:56.322 --> 15:58.347
That would be the Crawfords.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.791
Two blocks down,
turn left, red mailbox.

16:00.859 --> 16:02.725
Appreciate it.

16:19.111 --> 16:22.570
Excuse me.
Is this the Crawfords'?

16:22.648 --> 16:24.582
Thanks.

16:26.385 --> 16:28.444
You're on.

16:28.520 --> 16:32.356
Ms. Crawford?
Hi, I'm Liz Parker.

16:32.357 --> 16:32.380
Ms. Crawford?
Hi, I'm Liz Parker.

16:32.490 --> 16:35.983
Vanessa's assistant.
We talked on the phone.

16:37.128 --> 16:40.621
Oh, sure. Liz Parker.

16:42.600 --> 16:47.299
I'm really sorry to hear what happened
to your daughter. It's so terrible.

16:47.372 --> 16:50.774
Oh, thank you, dear.
What are you doing here?

16:50.842 --> 16:55.439
Oh, um, I just wanted to drop off
some of your daughter's personal effects.

16:55.513 --> 17:00.349
Oh, honey, that is so sweet.

17:00.418 --> 17:02.443
Well, you didn't have
to come clear up here.

17:02.520 --> 17:05.285
My gosh, it must be 400 miles.

17:05.356 --> 17:08.290
Walt! Visitors!

17:09.694 --> 17:11.627
Did you kids work for Vanessa?

17:11.695 --> 17:13.493
No, not exactly.

17:13.564 --> 17:16.192
Oh, um, this is Max...

17:16.267 --> 17:18.133
<i>Isabel and, uh, Tess.</i>

17:21.071 --> 17:25.839
Walt, these young people
drove all the way up here...

17:25.910 --> 17:28.242
to bring home
some of Vanessa's things.

17:28.311 --> 17:31.907
- Why didn't they just send 'em?
- What a thing to say!

17:31.983 --> 17:35.248
<i>After they went
to all that trouble.</i>

17:35.319 --> 17:38.778
You must be so tired and hungry
after that long drive.

17:38.856 --> 17:42.793
Come on in the house.
I'm gonna make you somethin' to eat.

17:50.601 --> 17:53.127

No, the, uh- the 1 O.

18:17.695 --> 18:20.062
- You don't wanna do that.
- I don't?

18:20.131 --> 18:23.726
You wanna go over to Lordsburg.
Hook onto the 70.

18:23.801 --> 18:26.964
Stay on that till you see
the Model Reservoir sign.

18:27.038 --> 18:30.531
And that'll shoot you
right onto Artesia.

18:30.608 --> 18:33.873
- Walt, did you hear that?
- Hmm?

18:33.945 --> 18:37.939
- They came all this way for her service.
- Huh.

18:38.015 --> 18:41.645
Well, we felt like-
like we should come.

18:41.719 --> 18:45.087
The congresswoman,
she was very-

18:45.156 --> 18:47.921
she was special to all of us.

18:47.992 --> 18:50.586
- Like a mother.
- Really?

18:58.169 --> 19:00.103
Hi.

19:01.305 --> 19:04.832
Nicholas. There you are.
Come on in here.

19:04.909 --> 19:07.105
- Come on. Say hello.
- No, ma'am.

He took it real hard.

19:11.849 --> 19:14.079
<i>He and his sister

19:23.995 --> 19:26.157
Maybe we'd better
just find a hotel.

- There ain't but one.
- All four of you?

19:29.433 --> 19:33.700
<i>At that old motor inn? I won't hear of it.
You're all gonna spend the night here.</i>

19:33.771 --> 19:36.263
<i>And then tomorrow we can go
to the memorial service together.</i>

19:36.340 --> 19:39.640

- If Vanessa was like your mother...

- That's not the way I remember it.

- Okay, so now it's my fault.
- Yes. You know what?

you should consider everything to be your fault.

- I know.

20:25.623 --> 20:30.527
But if we can talk reality here for a second,
I think she booked out of town.

20:30.595 --> 20:33.155
No, no, she wouldn't do that.
She's obsessed with me.

20:33.230 --> 20:35.927
Well, I guess that makes
two of you then, doesn't it?

20:36.000 --> 20:37.934
She'll show up sooner or later.

20:38.002 --> 20:41.028
How 'bout sooner?

- Whoa, hey! Truce.

Don't worry. I won't.
You're watching the building.

20:47.745 --> 20:51.113
You figured out where I'd be
from the pictures. That's very good, Mikey G.

I'm not obsessed with him, okay?
I follow him...

21:19.644 --> 21:22.204

- <i>“Our leader?“</i>
- <i>We 're not with the QtherSk/ns.</i>

that if you were in charge instead of Max...

21:29.420 --> 21:31.388
that none of this
would have ever happened.

21:31.455 --> 21:34.425
- What are you talking about? In charge of what?
- Ourp/anet, Michael

You don't remember
any of this, do you?

21:37.294 --> 21:40.161
- Suppose you tell me.
- The short version, please.

21:40.231 --> 21:44.225
The short version is that our planet
was on the brink of a golden age...

21:44.301 --> 21:46.998
and then it all fell apart.

21:47.071 --> 21:49.233

22:18.836 --> 22:23.273
could you please tell me that you do not believe
what this Michael worshipper has to say?

22:26.811 --> 22:29.508
No, no- No way.

22:29.580 --> 22:32.049
No, this is just part of your plan
to divide and conquer.

22:32.116 --> 22:34.050

to hear this.

22:37.188 --> 22:39.282
What's in Copper Summit, Arizona?

22:39.356 --> 22:41.882
Copper Summit'sjust
some old tourist trap.

22:41.959 --> 22:45.953
- What's there?
- I'd stay away from there.

22:46.030 --> 22:48.158
- Why?
- Yeah, why?

22:48.232 --> 22:52.465
Let's just say there aren't
any Michael worshippers in Copper Summit.

23:20.965 --> 23:23.832
<i>Penny for your thoughts?</i>

23:23.901 --> 23:27.132
- Sorry.
- Oh, that's all right.

23:27.204 --> 23:31.038
You must have been
very proud of her.

23:31.108 --> 23:32.940
Very.

23:33.010 --> 23:35.035
Tell me about her.

23:35.112 --> 23:38.742
What was she like
when she was my age?

23:38.816 --> 23:42.081
Oh, she was wonderful.

Wonderful.

23:54.431 --> 23:56.365

none of us would go anywhere alone.

- Fine.
- Wait.

24:07.044 --> 24:10.537
Max, look, there'sjust-
there's nothing left to say.

24:10.614 --> 24:14.710
- Except the truth.
- We have already been through this.

24:16.520 --> 24:20.013
So far all I know is whatl saw.
And what I saw can't be true...

24:20.090 --> 24:24.652
because it means everything
I felt in my heart for the last year is a lie!

24:24.728 --> 24:27.288
Now you owe me an explanation,
and I want it right now!

24:27.364 --> 24:30.493
Please quit shouting, Max.

24:30.568 --> 24:32.593
- You're scaring me.
- That's a lie too!

24:34.505 --> 24:38.066
You're not scared.
You're hiding something.

24:38.142 --> 24:40.133
I'm not.

24:41.478 --> 24:44.243
What the hell is going
on with you, Liz?

24:44.315 --> 24:47.341
We never lied to each other,
never kept a secret from each other.

up on this pedestal, Max...

24:50.888 --> 24:55.325

We were gonna spend three days
just at the Air and Space Museum.

26:12.536 --> 26:14.732
Did you get a lot of time
with her growing up?

26:14.805 --> 26:18.799
When she'd visit,
she'd make time.

26:18.876 --> 26:21.538
She always told me there's
this whole wide world out there.

26:21.612 --> 26:26.482
And she didn't want me stuck in
Copper Summit for the rest of my life.

26:26.550 --> 26:31.283
She used to tell me
stories about... this planet...

26:31.355 --> 26:35.815
<i>in another galaxy,
and how there's this war going on.</i>

26:35.893 --> 26:38.294

True stories?

26:41.065 --> 26:43.466
[Scoffs]
How could they be true?

26:46.704 --> 26:48.968
Did she ever mention Vilandra?

26:50.040 --> 26:51.974
How do you know about Vilandra?

26:52.042 --> 26:55.376
Vanessa told me some stories too.

27:02.019 --> 27:06.320
- Hey 0h, sorry
- I have to go.

27:11.495 --> 27:15.454
I've been looking all over the house
for you. I was worried.

27:15.532 --> 27:19.765
I just found out that Whitaker
was adopted. Ida told me.

27:19.837 --> 27:22.431
- That means that Ida, Walt and
Nicholas could be human. - Exactly.

27:22.506 --> 27:24.531
And the Universal
Friendship League...

27:24.608 --> 27:28.169
it's supposed to be
a civic organization, like the Elks.

27:28.245 --> 27:32.204
Ida says they've been handling
all the arrangements for the funeral.

27:32.282 --> 27:35.650
She and Walt haven't
even seen the body.

27:35.719 --> 27:40.680
- Because there is no body. - Right, but as
long as the league handles everything...

27:40.758 --> 27:43.022
nobody has to know that.

27:44.528 --> 27:47.020
What about the kid?

27:47.097 --> 27:51.762
I don't know. You came crashing in before
I had a chance to start a real conversation.

27:58.575 --> 28:00.771
<i>[ Courtney]
This is a huge mistake.</i>

28:00.844 --> 28:03.108
- You're gonna get yourself killed.
- That's my problem.

28:03.180 --> 28:08.084
I didn't spend 5O years finding you so you could
throw your life away out of misplaced loyalty.

28:08.152 --> 28:12.680
- F/fiyyears?
- We came here in 1950. Do the math.

28:12.756 --> 28:15.020
So, what, that would
make you 65, 70?

28:15.092 --> 28:17.083
<i>You're old enough to be
Michaefs grandmother.</i>

28:17.161 --> 28:19.220
I just- I love that. I do.

28:19.296 --> 28:22.061
- Hey, husks don't age.
- Husks?

28:22.132 --> 28:26.228
Yeah, me, my skin.
This thing that I'm wearing, it never ages.

28:26.303 --> 28:29.170
- What is your point?
- The point is I've been a babe for 5O years.

28:29.239 --> 28:32.300
- What are you gonna look like 5O years from now?
- Will you two let it go?

28:32.376 --> 28:35.573
You're giving me a headache.
What the hell is a husk?

28:35.646 --> 28:38.775
It's basically a shell.
It protects us from the environment.

28:40.451 --> 28:44.285
- <i>Like a</i> space suit.
- <i>Th/s planet's atmosphere ls hostile t0 our race.</i>

28:44.354 --> 28:46.288
Husks are
a life-form technology...

28:46.356 --> 28:49.223
that we can genetically manipulate
to resemble human bodies.

28:49.293 --> 28:52.228
Our relationship to it
is essentially parasitic.

28:52.296 --> 28:55.960
- Your <i>skin</i> is <i>alive?</i>
- <i>Like the trees are alive.</i>

28:56.033 --> 28:59.936
- So what's with the peeling?
- They're good for maybe 5O years.

29:00.003 --> 29:01.937
The husks are dying.

29:02.005 --> 29:04.064
Ifall the Skins in Copper
Summit are about to die...

29:04.141 --> 29:06.872
then all we have to do
is wait them out.

29:06.944 --> 29:09.106
If the husks die,
we're home free, right?

29:15.252 --> 29:18.916
Okay, what are you
not telling us?

29:18.989 --> 29:20.980
The harvest.

29:32.202 --> 29:36.161
I don't get it. What's the point
of putting on a big show like this?

29:38.041 --> 29:42.205
That's exactly what this is-
a big show.

29:42.279 --> 29:46.216
After this, there won't be any questions
about what happened to Whitaker.

29:57.261 --> 30:00.856
- I'll be back.
- Isabel?

30:44.107 --> 30:46.041

out of here. - But when destiny called...

34:02.704 --> 34:06.004
she answered the call
of public service.

34:06.074 --> 34:09.043
<i>[ Max ]
lust head for the door, slow and steady.</i>

34:13.848 --> 34:15.815
Leaving so soon?

34:17.052 --> 34:18.884
[All Gasp]

34:28.228 --> 34:30.493
<i>You mustn't be
in such a hurry to leave us.</i>

34:32.067 --> 34:34.967
It appears our long search
for the royal four has finally ended.

34:35.036 --> 34:37.801
How convenient of you
to deliver yourselves to us.

34:37.871 --> 34:40.534
She's not one of us.
Let her go.

34:40.608 --> 34:44.373
She's a human who knows too much.
It's a darn shame 'cause she's awfully cute.

34:44.446 --> 34:47.245
You must be the once
and future king.

34:47.315 --> 34:49.579
- And his <i>bride.</i>
- That's right.

34:49.650 --> 34:51.813
You won't remember me,
but I remember you.

34:53.420 --> 34:56.014
This is a moment
I've waited for a long time.

35:01.563 --> 35:04.396
How long do you think
you can hold out against all of us?

35:04.466 --> 35:06.577
As long as I have to.

35:06.601 --> 35:07.033
As long as I have to.

35:07.102 --> 35:11.335
<i>[ Nicholas] It's taken 2O years
nursing them from spores to maturity.</i>

35:11.406 --> 35:14.137
Now they're almost ready
to harvest.

35:16.344 --> 35:19.609
Don't worry.
You're safe here with us, Vilandra.

35:19.681 --> 35:23.242
- My name is Isabel.
- For the moment.

35:23.318 --> 35:27.221
But when I looked into your eyes,
it was Vilandra who looked back.

35:27.288 --> 35:30.383
<i>- Ne.
- Your destiny is with us, with Kivar.</i>

35:30.458 --> 35:33.359
- He's waiting to hear that we've found you.
- I don't even know-

35:33.428 --> 35:35.795
<i>Who the hell Kivar is?</i>

35:35.864 --> 35:38.890
The royal four.
lfonly the people could see you now.

35:38.967 --> 35:41.902
<i>Clueless teenagers groping
for their own identities.</i>

35:41.970 --> 35:45.702
You'd lose some of that legendary aura
that's sprung up over the years.

35:45.773 --> 35:48.265
- What do you want?
- It's what you want.

35:48.343 --> 35:50.869
You just can't remember.

35:50.945 --> 35:54.779
I'm here to take you back to him, Vilandra.
The leader of the rebellion.

35:54.849 --> 35:58.046
<i>The man who currently sits
on your brothers tarnished throne.</i>

35:58.119 --> 36:01.350
The man for whom
you sacrificed a kingdom.

36:01.422 --> 36:03.550
Your lover, Kivar.

36:03.625 --> 36:05.389
No.

36:05.460 --> 36:08.395
- [ Groans]
- You're not going anywhere.

36:13.902 --> 36:17.839
You know, on our world, I was considered
to be something of a ladies' man.

36:17.906 --> 36:21.570
<i>I even remember you giving me
the eye now and again.</i>

36:21.643 --> 36:25.602
But after spending 5O years
as a teenage misfit...

36:25.680 --> 36:30.675
having all the women laugh at me,
I've grown far less tolerant of the female sex.

36:30.752 --> 36:34.950
- Where's the granilith?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

36:50.972 --> 36:53.964
I can help.
Let my strength flow into yours.

36:55.276 --> 36:57.802
- Where is the granilith?
- <i>[ Door Closes ]</i>

37:02.750 --> 37:05.310
[Neck Muscles Cracking]

37:05.386 --> 37:07.320
Okay, now I'm pissed.

37:13.962 --> 37:16.659
Get her out of here!

37:21.135 --> 37:23.399
And who do we have here?

37:26.774 --> 37:30.176
That gleam of dull stupidity
in the eyes.

37:31.646 --> 37:33.910
If I'm not mistaken...

37:33.982 --> 37:37.008
you must be the king's
second-in-command.

37:37.085 --> 37:39.816
<i>I killed you myself
in your last life.</i>

37:41.522 --> 37:44.355
- Ready to die again?
- Bring it on.

37:53.067 --> 37:55.661
Well, it's time for this little game
to come to an end.

38:00.241 --> 38:03.040
- No!
-[AirHissing]

38:04.145 --> 38:06.375
<i>[Screaming]</i>

38:20.928 --> 38:22.453
[Groans]

38:24.499 --> 38:26.433
[Gasps]

38:27.468 --> 38:30.927
[All Moaning]

38:44.252 --> 38:47.222
<i>What are you doing here?
We gotta go now!</i>

38:47.288 --> 38:50.588
Way ahead of you, boss.
Michael?Where's Michael?

38:53.828 --> 38:55.887
Open the trunk!

39:00.902 --> 39:03.667
- Is that what I think it is?
-just drive!

39:16.517 --> 39:19.384
<i>[Alarm Blaring]</i>

40:19.614 --> 40:22.709
[Sighs]
The husks?

40:22.784 --> 40:24.718
Destroyed.

40:26.020 --> 40:28.489
Well, that's the end of it then.

40:28.556 --> 40:31.150
We're all as good as dead.

40:31.225 --> 40:34.160
We may be as good as dead...

40:34.228 --> 40:36.822
but this is not the end.
