01:16.600 --> 01:19.285
What news Sire? Does the child...

01:19.600 --> 01:21.409
Stillborn. A funeral is planned.

01:22.840 --> 01:25.764
- Did the tailors arrive?
- On their way.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.649
It is the talk of the court.

01:28.440 --> 01:30.807
Sire. My heart is heavy for your loss...

01:31.280 --> 01:32.850
Ensure the talk continues.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.968
Make it the card table gossip.

01:36.560 --> 01:37.766
Leave us now.

01:48.960 --> 01:51.884
- Sire, before...
- Do not address the king directly.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.769
I think he already has.

01:54.800 --> 01:58.088
The men we apprehended wore
Spanish leather.

01:58.240 --> 02:00.686
If I wore clogs
would that make me Dutch?

02:01.560 --> 02:04.723
- You would have me be silent?
- Deeply.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.764
I wish to warn His Majesty

02:07.760 --> 02:11.128
since we already have
a Spanish influence in our lives.

02:20.120 --> 02:22.964
Her Majesty must remain
abed a week Sire.

02:23.440 --> 02:26.762
As for the condition of the child,
I have an explanation.

02:34.880 --> 02:37.008
I cannot wait to hear it.

02:38.680 --> 02:41.081
As you know Sire,
Her Majesty has enjoyed

02:41.240 --> 02:43.891
the company of a little blackamoor,
Nabo.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.687
She liked to play games
with him: peekaboo and so on.

02:48.160 --> 02:51.767
As I understand it,
after Her Majesty fell pregnant

02:51.920 --> 02:56.084
Nabo hid behind a piece of furniture,
jumped out on her to surprise her

02:57.360 --> 03:00.011
and he gave her a look of such force

03:00.160 --> 03:02.891
that it corrupted the royal womb
with darkness.

03:07.040 --> 03:09.566
It must have been
a very penetrating look.

03:23.160 --> 03:26.926
- Where is the child now?
- A wet nurse, out of sight.

03:27.480 --> 03:30.324
- We trust her.
- You're sure?

03:31.640 --> 03:33.722
Quite sure, Your Majesty.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.564
Very well Fabien,
do as you must.

03:49.920 --> 03:55.006
<i>* I'm the king of my own land.</i>

03:59.640 --> 04:03.042
<i>* Facing tempests of dust</i>

04:03.200 --> 04:07.603
<i>* HI fight until the end</i>

04:11.760 --> 04:17.563
<i>* Creatures of my dreams
rise up and dance with me</i>

04:26.240 --> 04:34.240
<i>* Now and forever
* I'm your king!</i>

04:51.840 --> 04:55.606
Sire, we may have war
or we may have splendor

04:55.760 --> 04:58.240
but I do not believe
that we can have both.

04:58.920 --> 05:00.763
Then it must be war.

05:00.920 --> 05:04.606
The Dutch will secure trade routes
into West Africa alone.

05:05.280 --> 05:08.363
To see our rivals profit
from our own inaction is not

05:08.520 --> 05:10.329
a price we should pay.

05:10.680 --> 05:14.082
As lucrative as these routes may be
for the Dutch,

05:14.360 --> 05:17.204
you cannot put a price on glory, Sire.

05:18.520 --> 05:20.045
The Dutch are mistaken.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.206
And France has my wife
to thank for that.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.291
<i>(Lady ¿Cômo Se encuentra?</i>

05:39.200 --> 05:40.200
<i>¿Esté mejor?</i>

05:56.520 --> 05:58.329
You have no color in your cheeks

05:59.720 --> 06:01.210
unlike your daughter.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.609
Please, husband. Where is she?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.206
Husband...

06:13.800 --> 06:16.280
You know what Socrates
said about marriage?

06:17.160 --> 06:18.924
He said: By all means marry.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.887
If you get a good wife, you'll be happy.

06:23.520 --> 06:26.888
Get a bad one,
you'll become a philosopher.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.770
I must tell you, madam,
I feel very philosophical.

06:31.440 --> 06:32.805
<i>Madre De Dios...</i>

06:39.680 --> 06:42.081
What we do resonates
throughout the world.

06:42.640 --> 06:45.211
Do you imagine William of Orange
if he knew,

06:45.360 --> 06:48.045
would pause for a second at our borders?

06:49.120 --> 06:52.761
That he would see the king
and his country as anything but weak,

06:53.160 --> 06:56.804
debased, a laughing stock?

06:58.480 --> 07:01.131
This was not the act of a wife or queen.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.367
This was an act of sedition
by a traitor.

07:05.840 --> 07:09.765
- Where is our daughter?
- Your daughter is in God's mercy.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.208
French when it pleases you,
Spanish when you choose to hide.

07:19.760 --> 07:22.730
If the court deems me a fool
I'm worthy of something,

07:22.880 --> 07:24.530
even if it is pity.

07:24.920 --> 07:27.048
You will find no pity from me.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.489
Her Majesty looks unwell.

07:31.480 --> 07:32.686
See Masson tends her.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.443
Her confinement shall be extended

07:37.440 --> 07:39.886
until she is fit to re-join us.

07:43.760 --> 07:46.366
Your 1st time in court
I said...?

07:46.640 --> 07:50.326
That you would reward any favour
with interest?

07:51.520 --> 07:52.726
And yet,

07:53.800 --> 07:55.165
I am still waiting,

07:55.800 --> 07:58.280
after you had me spread all those lies

07:58.440 --> 08:01.011
about your little blonde friend.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.970
Cousin,
I love that you are so very patient.

08:10.080 --> 08:12.686
Never doubt my affection for you.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.164
Oh! By the king!

08:19.440 --> 08:23.684
"The king invites you to a private
showing of diverse suits of lace..."

08:24.280 --> 08:27.489
A domestic <i>was</i> in the hallway
north of the birthing room.

08:27.640 --> 08:30.641
Pallid... "master tailors"

08:30.800 --> 08:34.043
green eyes, a scar on her chin.

08:34.440 --> 08:35.601
I want her name.

08:36.120 --> 08:38.645
- "A banquet will follow." Mother!
- Excited?

08:40.480 --> 08:43.323
- Heard from Rossignol on the cipher?
- No.

08:43.919 --> 08:47.083
- The moment he sends word, fetch me.
- Yes.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.046
<i>* Pour venir manger ton ton.</i>

08:50.200 --> 08:52.726
<i>* Pour venir manger ton ton.</i>

08:58.000 --> 08:59.411
Thank you!

09:12.720 --> 09:14.722
That is very expensive firewood.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.929
If I do not burn these,
the rest will die, Sire.

09:18.520 --> 09:21.046
A greening disease spread in many
by flies.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.365
Good rootstock.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.843
If we girdle and graft
on the budwood

09:26.400 --> 09:30.121
scions take, trees propagate,
the orchard is saved.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.487
How do you know
the rootstock is strong?

09:35.240 --> 09:36.366
What's the measure?

09:36.520 --> 09:40.650
I make sure I know the provenance
of every tree Your Majesty receives.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.201
This one,

09:44.160 --> 09:47.084
it came first from
the University of Strasbourg.

09:48.080 --> 09:51.721
This one, the Botanic Garden
of Montpellier.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.566
Before that: China, Arabia.

09:56.080 --> 09:58.765
To know the seed
is to know the root.

09:58.920 --> 10:02.367
To know a root is to know
the tree and the fruit.

10:02.840 --> 10:05.810
So, I burn the sick
to preserve the pure

10:06.640 --> 10:09.849
and the king shall have
his orange blossom.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.849
You're well spoken
for a soldier.

10:14.440 --> 10:15.885
Words are weapons, Sire.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.850
I've used many in my time.

10:18.440 --> 10:19.930
But I'm a gardener now.

10:22.480 --> 10:23.606
My gardener.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.045
Just look at them.

11:25.280 --> 11:29.683
A king either rules his ministers
or is ruled by them.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.527
Only power controls a country

11:34.200 --> 11:37.363
and <i>as</i> of now, the power lies with them.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.881
It is time to show them who you are.

11:50.920 --> 11:54.561
Without the law documents before us,
my edict has no legitimacy.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.844
Where are the archives
and why are they not before us?

12:00.320 --> 12:01.970
Still on the road?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.321
They decided
to turn the caravan around.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.931
Who made this decision?

12:08.080 --> 12:09.684
The road from Paris

12:09.840 --> 12:13.128
is dangerous, especially
the royal lands round this lodge.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.126
We cannot have court materials
taken hostage.

12:16.280 --> 12:18.681
That is what has happened,
Monsieur Louvois.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.204
The masters of the tailor's guild
arrived safely.

12:23.360 --> 12:26.330
You'd think the king's guard
could survive.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.084
We think only of security.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.920
- We merely serve Your Majesty.
- For now.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.328
If Louvois does not hold his tongue

12:41.480 --> 12:43.482
I may volunteer to hold it for him.

12:43.640 --> 12:46.689
I'd rather have an honest critic
than a false friend.

12:46.840 --> 12:50.083
Sire, he seems to talk only
of his opposition to you.

12:50.880 --> 12:53.804
He takes contrary positions
to all of your plans,

12:53.960 --> 12:58.204
then declares them thunderously
to anyone who will listen.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.089
And long may he continue.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.482
I am sure I do not understand, Sire.

13:05.040 --> 13:06.040
You will.

13:10.640 --> 13:11.640
How is your son?

13:13.640 --> 13:14.640
Bontemps?

13:21.280 --> 13:23.169
Is he alright?

13:31.040 --> 13:32.724
Carmelite and lavender.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.161
Do you like it?

13:36.120 --> 13:37.120
Persian silk.

13:39.760 --> 13:40.761
Leave it alone.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.884
Forgive me Monsieur.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.165
The royal baby!

14:22.480 --> 14:24.130
We all have a heavy heart.

14:25.640 --> 14:27.369
I saw something.

14:32.840 --> 14:33.840
What do you mean?

14:36.000 --> 14:39.607
The child was alive
and the strangest color!

14:43.240 --> 14:45.083
What madness are you speaking?

14:45.400 --> 14:47.880
Sire, I beg you.
I say this in confidence.

14:48.040 --> 14:51.203
My mother works for you
thus I felt I must speak it.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.922
Perhaps you might help me
join her there in service?

14:55.080 --> 14:56.809
I'm so scared!

15:11.040 --> 15:13.122
Doctors made every effort

15:14.160 --> 15:16.322
but the pox was too strong

15:17.240 --> 15:18.730
the fever too much.

15:21.280 --> 15:22.486
It took him.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.570
I am with you in your loss.

15:40.720 --> 15:41.881
Go home.

15:44.760 --> 15:45.886
Sire, you are home.

15:46.440 --> 15:49.091
- Grieve while you can.
- I will.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.970
- Be with those you love.
- I am, Sire.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.200
You defy me?

15:57.960 --> 16:00.361
My place is with you.

16:01.800 --> 16:05.521
God is punishing me,
for hurting those closest to my heart.

16:05.680 --> 16:06.806
Testing you, Sire.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.170
Offering a gift.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.885
Vengeance and mercy
are his to choose.

16:14.360 --> 16:16.328
They are also yours.

16:18.280 --> 16:21.443
<i>I</i> believe He placed this child
in your care for a reason.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.967
- I've heard enough.
- Let her live.

16:24.120 --> 16:25.451
And then what?

16:28.080 --> 16:29.206
Come now,

16:30.040 --> 16:31.166
truly,

16:32.040 --> 16:33.246
answer me.

16:34.040 --> 16:37.169
Sire, I do not presume any authority
or judgment.

16:37.680 --> 16:38.920
Of course not.

16:41.880 --> 16:44.770
A secret like this
has the power of a tide.

16:45.520 --> 16:49.161
Once released, it will go where it must,
beyond our control,

16:50.040 --> 16:54.602
and that will be the end
of my life, of your life,

16:54.760 --> 16:56.205
of this court...

16:56.360 --> 16:58.727
- Sire, I meant only...
- Grieve your loss,

17:00.280 --> 17:02.044
but do not forget your place.

17:07.240 --> 17:08.366
So pale.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.242
Needs a distraction.
It'll pass.

17:12.960 --> 17:16.042
- You sound very sure.
- You doubt my opinion?

17:16.760 --> 17:19.047
I only see that she has not recovered.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.281
You have a different solution
perhaps?

17:21.760 --> 17:23.808
Why go on this way-
she's no better?

17:23.960 --> 17:25.405
Why not change things?

17:25.560 --> 17:27.289
I am not going to argue.

17:29.120 --> 17:32.203
Besides, what is done is done.
Have you packed the bags?

17:32.680 --> 17:34.682
Father, stop this.
It'll be the end.

17:35.040 --> 17:38.442
Of both of us
if we do not take measures!

17:38.880 --> 17:40.644
Then let me help you.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.727
We cannot un-see what we have seen!

17:46.280 --> 17:47.520
They will kill us.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.326
She needs us here.

17:57.840 --> 18:01.481
Sire, I serve you now
<i>as</i> I served your father.

18:02.400 --> 18:05.290
He did things
as they have always been done.

18:05.880 --> 18:09.282
I see you <i>as</i> a very different
kind of man,

18:11.040 --> 18:12.724
born in a new age,

18:12.880 --> 18:17.568
born perhaps years ahead
of all who love and follow you.

18:18.560 --> 18:21.564
The choice is clear.
There are two paths.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.802
One worn and one yet to be.

18:24.840 --> 18:28.970
How you plant your next step
ahead in this moment

18:29.120 --> 18:31.691
will determine the way ahead
for all of us.

18:32.680 --> 18:36.401
We know how kings of the past
would have moved against this problem

18:37.960 --> 18:40.361
but you are different, Sire.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.286
You are the king of our future.

18:45.320 --> 18:48.324
The only question is,
what kind shall it be?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.401
Add a monthly stipend
to the Household.

18:59.160 --> 19:00.160
Under the name...

19:00.240 --> 19:02.481
The pension must remain
unrecorded,

19:03.040 --> 19:05.725
outside of all record.

19:08.840 --> 19:10.046
Do as you must.

19:17.520 --> 19:20.046
Baptise it thoroughly.

19:26.680 --> 19:29.160
See how life fights death.

19:32.200 --> 19:33.850
Cherish this moment.

19:35.160 --> 19:36.286
It is God given.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.804
Stop at once!

19:47.240 --> 19:49.049
Our work protects the king.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.009
Your work here is finished.

19:51.480 --> 19:54.086
What hope does the wretch have
outside of here?

19:54.240 --> 19:56.163
That is not your concern.

19:56.800 --> 19:59.565
The Gazette De France
will report on the funeral

19:59.720 --> 20:01.848
with consideration
of a royal passing.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.843
A grave is prepared.

20:11.320 --> 20:12.890
A grave error, to be sure.

21:16.480 --> 21:17.481
How is he?

21:18.840 --> 21:20.330
As you would expect.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.360
He should be here.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.089
The king does not mourn.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.010
In public perhaps.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.443
In truth, anywhere.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.606
It's not only protocol.
The man doesn't weep.

21:38.920 --> 21:40.524
Not with you.

21:40.680 --> 21:42.364
It takes a woman to see it.

21:43.640 --> 21:46.041
He will have a sorrowful heart.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.440
His heart,

21:48.520 --> 21:52.320
if he has one,
is a whole other matter entirely.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.360
Is it not?

22:03.920 --> 22:04.920
You look nice.

22:11.680 --> 22:14.524
Our Father, who art in heaven,

22:14.920 --> 22:16.649
hallowed be thy name.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.484
Thy kingdom come, thy will

22:18.640 --> 22:20.881
be done on earth
<i>as</i> it is in heaven.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.002
Give us this day our daily bread,

22:24.440 --> 22:26.408
And forgive us our trespasses,

22:26.840 --> 22:29.605
as we forgive those
that trespass against us.

22:30.120 --> 22:32.088
Lead us not into temptation,

22:33.080 --> 22:35.481
but deliver us from evil.

22:36.160 --> 22:38.811
Now and forever.

22:41.040 --> 22:42.201
Amen.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.449
Amen.

23:50.560 --> 23:54.121
- Who is that?
- He is your son,

23:56.360 --> 23:58.124
Louis XIV.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.369
Not yet he's not.

24:06.800 --> 24:10.202
A maid comes crying to you
with information on the royal baby

24:10.360 --> 24:12.408
and now she's dead.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.648
Now we're not to leave Versailles

24:16.800 --> 24:19.326
because the queen is unwell.

24:21.840 --> 24:23.001
What's going on?

24:23.880 --> 24:25.484
What is your brother hiding?

24:26.800 --> 24:28.643
You know him better than anyone.

24:33.320 --> 24:36.483
Be careful about what you say
and how loudly you say it.

24:39.880 --> 24:42.804
The king wouldn't think twice
about dispatching you.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.002
Perhaps the baby was alive
after all.

24:48.440 --> 24:51.489
- We <i>saw</i> the child buried.
- We saw a box buried.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.409
Your brother thinks you're weak.

25:07.160 --> 25:09.925
You have more power than you realize.

25:11.360 --> 25:12.566
Use it!

25:16.160 --> 25:17.286
I intend to.

25:21.160 --> 25:23.766
This is your moment to shine, my love.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.046
I know.

25:25.720 --> 25:26.720
Show your worth.

25:30.720 --> 25:35.123
The Spanish fortified
Charleroi, Tournai, Douai and Lille.

25:35.840 --> 25:38.730
General Aumont has troops
in the north: Turenne.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.928
His battalions lie east of Cambrai.

25:55.960 --> 25:58.566
I say cut off all of Flanders
plus Lille

25:59.720 --> 26:01.927
and large Spanish bases in the east.

26:02.080 --> 26:03.241
Bruges,

26:04.440 --> 26:05.566
Ghent,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.685
Brussels and Namur.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.250
But we'd have to
cut the Spanish off from

26:13.400 --> 26:15.562
Tournai, Douai.
Who would lead our men?

26:16.080 --> 26:17.605
Maybe there's one.

26:21.800 --> 26:24.280
But in truth, he may not be ready.

27:06.960 --> 27:10.328
- To meet here is dangerous.
- We can't go, the queen is ill.

27:10.480 --> 27:12.448
The king won't have it.

27:13.040 --> 27:16.044
Noble families will come
for the carousel of fashion.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.411
This is our moment
to make our case.

27:21.240 --> 27:24.801
I hear the Duc De Cassel
shares our intent.

27:25.200 --> 27:26.406
Then let him come.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.291
Cassel does his own will.

27:28.440 --> 27:31.649
He's too rich, powerful
to listen to anyone but himself,

27:32.120 --> 27:34.851
but if we were to persuade his friends,

27:35.000 --> 27:36.843
then we might yet persuade him.

27:38.040 --> 27:39.326
No matter what,

27:39.480 --> 27:42.723
the building of Versailles
must be stopped.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.525
We grow in number every day

27:47.040 --> 27:50.487
and not even a king
can stop a tide.

28:05.720 --> 28:08.166
I've never seen
a cipher like this.

28:08.560 --> 28:10.528
Even Rossignol cannot break it.

28:10.680 --> 28:13.604
This was in Montcourf's rooms
yet he walks free?

28:13.760 --> 28:15.444
Free, but not unwatched.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.364
So we do not know what it says?

28:18.520 --> 28:22.525
These symbols are similar
to those we took off the prisoners.

28:24.360 --> 28:25.725
Spaniards?

28:25.880 --> 28:28.360
Someone inside your court
was helping them,

28:29.040 --> 28:30.769
<i>was</i> a friendly face.

28:30.920 --> 28:33.287
Then we must summon Moncourt to us.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.331
Better to lie fallow
and collect information.

28:37.440 --> 28:41.081
This paper was placed freely
upon Montcourt's bureau.

28:41.240 --> 28:43.481
He may not have known its true purpose.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.282
Well, one thing is clear.

28:46.880 --> 28:49.042
There is a plot against you, Sire.

28:49.200 --> 28:52.602
Montcourt has wounded you
before, he may try again.

29:29.880 --> 29:32.611
The men are at war,
and so are we.

29:32.760 --> 29:35.366
The men use their swords,
we use our beauty,

29:35.520 --> 29:37.329
but the end is the same,
my dear:

29:38.320 --> 29:39.685
conquest.

29:40.680 --> 29:42.011
This one is nice.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.529
You'll need more than a dress,

29:44.680 --> 29:47.968
a filigree bracelet and a necklace
of diamonds, believe me.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.121
But how do we pay?

29:49.680 --> 29:52.763
Oh! Let me worry about that.

29:53.040 --> 29:56.681
- Your job is to bring me a king.
- He's not even here.

30:10.400 --> 30:13.370
When you gaze at a king,
do not avert your eyes,

30:14.160 --> 30:16.208
especially looking like you do now.

30:18.160 --> 30:20.322
You were never more beautiful
than now.

30:22.160 --> 30:23.160
Leave us.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.401
Take it off.

30:58.960 --> 31:00.485
There is talk of war.

31:01.600 --> 31:02.726
Always.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.684
My husband would love to fight.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.850
Is that his desire?

31:11.840 --> 31:13.649
He talks of nothing else.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.961
If I send him
to the Spanish Netherlands,

31:18.840 --> 31:20.126
he may not return.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.567
A glorious death
would not displease him.

31:25.240 --> 31:27.368
That's my brother
you're speaking of.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.889
I speak it, Sire,

31:32.680 --> 31:33.966
but you think it.

31:35.840 --> 31:38.047
A little death
is good for everyone.

31:41.440 --> 31:45.126
Le Chevalier De Lorraine!
Philippe Duc d'Orléans!

32:03.560 --> 32:04.971
Oh, look!

32:17.360 --> 32:18.691
You mock me?

32:20.240 --> 32:21.240
How can I not?

32:22.080 --> 32:24.287
You are an embarrassment
to the king.

32:27.240 --> 32:30.449
You mock me, you mock my brother
that makes you a traitor.

32:31.320 --> 32:35.405
If I smite you, you will fall,
which makes me a dead man.

32:39.560 --> 32:40.561
Coward!

33:29.240 --> 33:30.605
Stop!

33:32.080 --> 33:33.684
You've made your point.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.844
Have you lost your mind?

34:05.160 --> 34:06.685
You choose who I marry,

34:07.720 --> 34:09.722
where I live,
how much money I spend,

34:09.880 --> 34:12.485
but you do not choose
what I wear, who I fuck.

34:12.639 --> 34:13.926
Understand this.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.726
Everything you are reflects on me.

34:17.080 --> 34:19.606
I've dressed like this
since 3 months old.

34:20.679 --> 34:22.444
My goal was to be less than you.

34:23.760 --> 34:27.650
Not my choice but my duty
to not be the cloud in front of the sun.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.360
Think it's hard being a king?

34:31.760 --> 34:33.444
Try being a king's brother.

34:36.239 --> 34:37.969
You can't trick me.

34:39.480 --> 34:41.369
I know what you're planning here.

34:43.159 --> 34:44.650
And what you're hiding.

34:46.600 --> 34:47.761
That's right...

34:48.800 --> 34:51.804
I know you, Brother.

34:53.040 --> 34:55.804
I have only given you
my love and respect.

34:55.960 --> 34:57.928
Do you say that fucking my wife?

34:58.320 --> 34:59.446
Someone has to!

35:07.480 --> 35:11.280
Everything I have I share with you,
but you won't share the truth.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.129
How can I have your back
if you won't tell me the truth?

35:15.280 --> 35:17.282
Some things you cannot know,

35:18.080 --> 35:19.844
things only a king can know.

35:20.520 --> 35:21.601
Where's the baby?

35:22.280 --> 35:24.521
The child did not survive.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.250
Know how rumours start?

35:33.440 --> 35:36.046
Your silence only fuels the fire.

35:41.760 --> 35:43.364
Let me help you.

35:44.600 --> 35:48.730
I have never uttered an ill word
against you, my brother.

35:55.080 --> 35:56.730
Your words don't worry me,

35:59.960 --> 36:00.960
Brother.

36:07.600 --> 36:11.082
Majesty, I want you to know
I've been praying for you.

36:13.080 --> 36:14.161
Why?

36:18.760 --> 36:22.810
As we sink into our deepest misery
we must remember:

36:23.720 --> 36:27.725
God's will is to rouse our souls
in longing for our promised Saviour.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.568
"Know that our redeemer liveth."

36:46.200 --> 36:47.884
You are a whore.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.404
You come to me for contrition

36:51.560 --> 36:54.643
even <i>as</i> my king's seed
swells your belly.

36:57.440 --> 37:00.649
We are all damned in this place.
Do you not see?

37:01.160 --> 37:04.289
I am the queen of harlots
and you are a pious puta

37:04.440 --> 37:06.488
and we can beg for mercy
all we like.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.961
Hellfires are gaping
to swallow us all.

37:10.480 --> 37:11.766
You must leave.

37:18.040 --> 37:20.611
Tend to Her Majesty,
I'll get a poultice.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.524
Sick from the birth.

37:22.680 --> 37:24.045
Where is Nabo?

37:24.200 --> 37:27.010
And the poultice will reduce
the womb's swelling.

37:27.160 --> 37:29.970
- It's swelling for a reason...
- Do as I say!

37:35.240 --> 37:36.685
Help me, please.

37:39.200 --> 37:40.690
And call for the King!

37:41.680 --> 37:44.331
Your Majesty,
let me make you comfortable.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.246
Your Majesty?

37:52.720 --> 37:55.929
Your Majesty!
Get my father! Quickly!

37:57.440 --> 37:58.885
Your Majesty!

38:08.720 --> 38:12.088
North and east are
out of the question. We cannot...

38:13.440 --> 38:14.440
You took it.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.525
You are red in the face.

38:16.680 --> 38:18.523
Took my tactic to give to him.

38:20.160 --> 38:23.721
All my life I have longed for war,
even the smallest taste,

38:23.880 --> 38:26.451
and now, you're denying me,
again and again.

38:26.600 --> 38:27.600
Ask me who leads.

38:27.880 --> 38:30.611
- Who will lead the charge?
- You will.

38:32.840 --> 38:36.367
Sire, you mentioned that the man
might not be ready yet.

38:36.520 --> 38:37.851
I meant you, Louvois.

38:39.680 --> 38:41.364
Congratulations, Brother,

38:42.120 --> 38:43.531
you are going to war.

38:43.880 --> 38:46.008
Sire, the queen!

38:59.720 --> 39:01.449
- Must be...
- God in heaven!

39:01.600 --> 39:05.207
Push on her stomach where you feel
my hand near the ovarium.

39:05.360 --> 39:07.647
- I'll pull it out the womb.
- Pull what?

39:07.960 --> 39:10.566
- If she dies, we both die.
- There, I have it!

39:16.120 --> 39:18.646
Her pulse's stronger.
Never speak of this.

39:19.360 --> 39:20.691
Speak of what?

39:21.480 --> 39:23.801
Her Majesty was unwell, Sire
and bled,

39:24.800 --> 39:27.929
but her condition looks <i>as</i> though
it will improve.

39:28.280 --> 39:29.281
So I see.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.286
You may leave.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.201
You will stay.

39:38.320 --> 39:39.320
Privacy!

39:55.440 --> 39:56.440
Show your arm.

39:57.480 --> 39:59.084
What is that in your hand?

40:00.000 --> 40:01.729
How did you stop the bleeding?

40:02.600 --> 40:03.647
Lie to me and God.

40:04.520 --> 40:07.091
After birth.
I removed it from her uterus...

40:07.400 --> 40:08.400
I know where.

40:09.280 --> 40:10.805
You knew it stops blood?

40:11.960 --> 40:12.960
It was a guess.

40:14.160 --> 40:16.288
I'm a midwife trained by my father.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.288
I'm a student of anatomy,
medicine.

40:19.440 --> 40:22.683
I do not recall signing any laws
allowing women doctors.

40:25.320 --> 40:26.970
I took body parts,

40:27.760 --> 40:29.330
studied the organs,

40:29.840 --> 40:31.569
took detailed notes, drew them.

40:31.920 --> 40:34.526
A justice would have you burnt
at the stake.

40:36.240 --> 40:38.766
- If that's your command.
- My command is...

40:42.320 --> 40:44.527
you stay close to me
on medical issues.

40:45.640 --> 40:47.483
As to your father's position,

40:47.640 --> 40:51.087
in the eyes of the court
he will remain our physician but

40:51.440 --> 40:53.408
advice I will heed
comes from you.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.086
Bontemps, let in air.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.650
Unless you advise against it?

41:03.480 --> 41:06.450
As long as we cover her,
fresh air will benefit her.

41:06.600 --> 41:08.807
Comfrey and calendula aid healing,

41:08.960 --> 41:10.291
rosemary for the pain.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.245
Don't look surprised.
I've put many women to bed.

42:19.560 --> 42:21.244
Noble opinion is ours.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.643
We shall need more than that.

42:24.040 --> 42:25.530
We have our tinder,

42:26.320 --> 42:28.129
one of us must strike the flint.

42:29.960 --> 42:32.770
If it is to be me, so be it.

42:38.520 --> 42:40.010
I must tell you all.

42:40.480 --> 42:43.882
I believe very soon we shall have
a revolution in our country.

42:46.120 --> 42:49.169
The world knows France
as a master of the battlefield,

42:49.720 --> 42:52.564
but a glimpse around this
glorious place tells you,

42:53.080 --> 42:54.764
soon our textile mercers

42:54.920 --> 42:58.083
and our master tailors
shall transform the world.

42:58.240 --> 43:02.006
Our fashions will be revered
just as much for their beauty,

43:02.440 --> 43:05.250
elegance, refinement and grace,

43:07.200 --> 43:08.531
the world's finest.

43:09.360 --> 43:13.922
At the carousel many spoke of a desire
to own the emerald rings on display.

43:14.400 --> 43:16.971
I'm afraid to say this
was never possible

43:17.120 --> 43:19.885
because I have bought every single one.

43:20.040 --> 43:21.929
I wish to give you all a gift...

43:22.720 --> 43:24.688
this special evening.

43:31.440 --> 43:33.602
I hope you enjoy the orange blossoms.

43:34.200 --> 43:35.850
I can trace their rootstock

43:36.000 --> 43:38.765
back to the ancient citrus forests
of Arabia.

43:43.520 --> 43:45.761
Which reminds me, Moncourt...

43:53.560 --> 43:54.846
How is your wife?

43:57.360 --> 44:00.921
Dead, Sire. She passed <i>away</i>
six weeks ago, sadly.

44:01.840 --> 44:04.411
Thank you for coming back to court
so quickly.

44:05.520 --> 44:07.807
No time to change
after the funeral?

44:11.480 --> 44:13.448
These are not my mourning clothes.

44:13.600 --> 44:14.886
Nor evening clothes.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.562
Neither are they French clothes.

44:20.840 --> 44:23.047
Your father, the Baron,

44:23.200 --> 44:25.806
inherited his title
from his grandfather?

44:26.320 --> 44:27.321
Yes, Sire.

44:27.840 --> 44:30.241
Originally
bequeathed to his grandmother,

44:31.120 --> 44:32.849
the Baroness of Saint-Maur,

44:33.520 --> 44:35.204
she just married a Seigneur.

44:36.320 --> 44:39.767
Seigneur Charles De Saint-Maur
no less, Sire.

44:39.920 --> 44:41.285
No more, sadly for you.

44:42.320 --> 44:45.767
A farmer's son might call himself
Charles De Saint-Maur

44:46.080 --> 44:47.969
if that is where he was born.

44:48.600 --> 44:50.921
Your father,
a common man with a fiefdom,

44:51.080 --> 44:55.881
<i>was a</i> vassal to his overlord,
the true noble, the Grand Seigneur.

45:00.040 --> 45:01.371
Isn't that right?

45:03.480 --> 45:07.724
He might be labelled a vassal,
perhaps, or a peasant,

45:08.760 --> 45:10.922
yet you try to be
above those men

45:11.080 --> 45:14.084
whom would gladly sweat
and toil to feed their families

45:14.560 --> 45:18.201
pay their taxes
and honor their duties to their King.

45:19.480 --> 45:22.768
You think yourself above them,
yet you lie far below.

45:24.280 --> 45:27.682
You pay nothing and do nothing,

45:27.840 --> 45:31.561
which leads me to believe
you are nothing,

45:32.720 --> 45:34.404
which begs the question:

45:36.240 --> 45:38.322
What is a nothing doing at my court?

45:38.840 --> 45:41.002
I can find you my papers, Sire.

45:41.560 --> 45:44.882
I beg you allow me to prove my worth.

45:45.160 --> 45:46.844
The papers are all here

45:47.520 --> 45:49.363
after an inexcusable delay.

45:49.560 --> 45:52.131
As to the delay, Sire,
as I mentioned, um,

45:52.280 --> 45:54.886
to not bother you with
trivial state affairs...

45:55.840 --> 45:57.080
I am the state!

46:12.440 --> 46:15.887
It has come to my attention
many of you are uncomfortable

46:16.040 --> 46:17.883
here on our visits to Versailles.

46:18.800 --> 46:20.165
Many of you prefer Paris

46:20.920 --> 46:23.400
or your lands and estates
you so dearly miss,

46:23.560 --> 46:25.722
some only a short ride <i>away.</i>

46:26.560 --> 46:29.564
To all of you, I say this:

46:31.320 --> 46:33.084
You will soon get used to it,

46:34.080 --> 46:37.004
and we shall all soon discover
who we are.

46:38.320 --> 46:41.130
Your noble birth freed you
from our taxes.

46:41.280 --> 46:43.328
Your falsehood,
condemned you to pay.

46:43.480 --> 46:46.609
- I have no money but my estate.
- Take his keys, then.

46:50.280 --> 46:52.851
- What do I do?
- You'll think of something.

46:55.200 --> 46:58.807
- You, what is your name?
- Pierre De la Croix.

47:01.720 --> 47:03.688
God smiles on you, la Croix.

47:10.920 --> 47:12.081
I do not know him.

47:12.960 --> 47:14.291
He doesn't belong here.

47:17.520 --> 47:20.649
The time's come to prove to me
who you are, all of you.

47:22.720 --> 47:25.007
Rest assured I will do the same.

47:43.040 --> 47:44.326
We're under suspicion.

47:44.480 --> 47:47.370
Every noble family must produce papers
or pay tax...

47:47.520 --> 47:49.887
What's this proof
everyone's talking of?

47:50.400 --> 47:52.926
Proof is proof.
We've nothing to worry about.

47:53.320 --> 47:55.243
Now go and enjoy yourself.

48:10.880 --> 48:12.120
Pull up a chair.

48:15.680 --> 48:17.967
I said a chair, not a stool:

48:18.960 --> 48:20.325
a chair with arms.

48:27.960 --> 48:30.930
Only kings sit by His Majesty
in a chair with arms.

48:31.080 --> 48:32.570
You are more than a king.

48:35.400 --> 48:36.640
You are my friend.

49:03.600 --> 49:06.331
I would like to hear
stories about your son.

49:10.520 --> 49:14.844
In his last hours, he asked me
to tell him about my life with you.

49:18.520 --> 49:19.965
And what did you say?

49:21.040 --> 49:22.610
I told him the truth:

49:24.680 --> 49:28.082
that it is God's gift to me
to be by your side...

49:33.160 --> 49:36.289
that the gardens seem so glorious

49:38.280 --> 49:41.648
that they themselves gave birth
to beauty

49:43.200 --> 49:45.771
and might steal the breath
from any man.

49:48.680 --> 49:52.924
I also told him he would
one day live and work in my place,

49:54.760 --> 49:59.527
that he might find himself
part of the finest family in the world,

50:01.640 --> 50:06.521
all of whom dare to dream
they might one day live like a king

50:09.400 --> 50:10.481
or a queen

50:12.240 --> 50:15.449
in a palace that will seduce your eyes

50:15.600 --> 50:17.967
and steal your heart,

50:19.080 --> 50:21.560
and that one day
when we are all gone...

50:23.120 --> 50:26.522
they will write stories
about this place of wonder.

50:27.640 --> 50:29.005
But when they do,

50:29.600 --> 50:32.604
I fear that those who hear it
might not believe it.

50:36.800 --> 50:39.644
And think
it's some kind of fairy tale.

50:40.240 --> 50:41.240
Oh my God!

50:53.640 --> 50:55.961
Did your son approve of the dream?

51:00.640 --> 51:03.405
He asked me if that was
where he was going.

51:05.320 --> 51:07.084
I told him it was.

51:16.680 --> 51:19.445
Some would say your son
is in a better place.

51:23.120 --> 51:26.920
<i>I</i> happen to believe true paradise
lies in his father's arms,

51:28.440 --> 51:30.966
to be here with you

51:32.280 --> 51:33.725
in this moment

51:36.960 --> 51:38.564
and that is not our choice.

51:40.120 --> 51:44.330
God has made his plans
and we cannot question his design,

51:45.760 --> 51:48.411
just <i>as</i> my people cannot question mine,

51:51.000 --> 51:52.126
but they will.

51:54.440 --> 51:55.601
They mean to kill me.

51:57.400 --> 52:00.802
They would kill us all
to preserve the past. They may succeed,

52:01.600 --> 52:04.490
but change will come
no matter what.

52:13.920 --> 52:16.969
And if we are to endure,
there is only one course.

52:17.920 --> 52:19.604
Which is what, Sire?

52:21.920 --> 52:24.400
We must lay our own foundation here.

52:26.200 --> 52:27.770
Why here, Sire?

52:27.920 --> 52:29.888
Because I won't be king of Paris.

52:31.760 --> 52:33.285
I know who I am.

52:35.360 --> 52:36.964
I am Louis XIV.

52:38.680 --> 52:40.170
I am King of France.

52:43.480 --> 52:46.643
Now these nobles must prove
their worth to me.

52:51.240 --> 52:52.765
See how they run.
