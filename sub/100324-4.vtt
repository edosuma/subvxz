Here to congratulate me for
resolving an Amber Alert peacefully?

40:24.373 --> 40:26.439
Didn't sound too peaceful to me.

40:28.942 --> 40:32.387
Mercer's filing a complaint
against me because I yelled at him?

40:32.449 --> 40:35.551
No, because you threw him
against a car and assaulted him.

40:35.600 --> 40:36.666
That's not what happened.

40:36.715 --> 40:37.903
It's what Sam's saying happened.

40:37.952 --> 40:40.875
Yeah, well, you still think
I'm paranoid about him?

40:42.995 --> 40:45.252
You know, it's been a busy few days.

40:45.346 --> 40:47.153
Thanks for your concern, everyone.

40:47.202 --> 40:48.409
Looks worse than it is,

40:48.458 --> 40:50.779
although I have filed
an official complaint.

40:50.979 --> 40:53.120
Doesn't matter, though,
a little shiner like this.

40:53.169 --> 40:54.296
What's important...

40:54.345 --> 40:56.429
I didn't do that. I didn't hit him.

40:56.555 --> 41:00.003
How integral was your search
party in locating Kodie Chartrand?

41:00.052 --> 41:02.948
You know,
as an experienced police officer,

41:02.997 --> 41:05.268
what I saw yesterday troubled me.

41:05.317 --> 41:08.893
It troubles me that an Amber
Alert almost wasn't issued at all.

41:09.072 --> 41:12.127
We all know in child abduction
cases, every second counts,

41:12.175 --> 41:14.394
and Millwood PD wasted hours.

41:14.443 --> 41:15.847
Frankly, it's left me concerned

41:15.896 --> 41:17.849
about the competence and integrity

41:18.041 --> 41:19.901
of the leadership.

41:20.550 --> 41:22.550
Thank you, that's all.

41:25.323 --> 41:27.807
You're right, he's gunning for you.

41:27.856 --> 41:29.856
And you gave him the ammo.

41:34.982 --> 41:37.350
You're gonna be charged
with contempt to the court order.

41:37.399 --> 41:39.019
We'll get you bail and get you home.

41:39.068 --> 41:41.790
And we're already working
on a plan to get your kids back.

41:43.533 --> 41:45.904
We have, before the Court,
a show cause hearing

41:45.953 --> 41:47.514
from Mushkode Chartrand.

41:47.640 --> 41:49.412
Ms. Cohen?

41:49.974 --> 41:52.519
On or about August 12th of this year,

41:52.568 --> 41:54.436
Mushkode Chartrand removed her children

41:54.484 --> 41:55.717
from their lawful guardian

41:55.766 --> 41:58.076
in violation of a court
sanction agreement.

41:58.125 --> 42:01.045
We have received from
the Millwood police force,

42:01.094 --> 42:02.974
a charging document for a

42:03.023 --> 42:05.513
summary conviction
contempt of court charge.

42:05.599 --> 42:08.480
Your Honour, my client
surrendered peacefully

42:08.529 --> 42:10.496
with the agreement
of a contempt charge.

42:10.545 --> 42:12.761
The Crown is exercising its discretion

42:12.810 --> 42:16.365
to increase the charge to two
charges of parental abduction.

42:16.468 --> 42:18.855
We will be seeking a 10-year sentence.

42:19.122 --> 42:20.967
Joanna, that's not what Beckbie said.

42:21.016 --> 42:22.456
We had a good faith agreement,
Your Honour.

42:22.505 --> 42:24.831
The agreement was made with
the arresting officer, Ms. Chang.

42:24.880 --> 42:26.878
The accused is a
demonstrated flight risk

42:26.927 --> 42:29.724
and has shown a willful
disregard for this court's orders.

42:29.773 --> 42:32.412
We are asking that bail be denied.

42:33.700 --> 42:36.790
Given the chronology and the
opinion presented by the Crown,

42:36.893 --> 42:39.781
bail does not seem appropriate
in this situation.

42:40.229 --> 42:42.951
Your Honour, my client
is a loving mother

42:42.999 --> 42:44.630
whose recent actions were driven

42:44.679 --> 42:47.060
by a hardwired protection instinct.

42:47.525 --> 42:49.102
She is a parent.

42:49.328 --> 42:51.240
Mushkode Chartrand isn't a flight risk,

42:51.289 --> 42:53.357
because the only
things she cares about,

42:53.406 --> 42:54.749
are her children.

42:54.923 --> 42:57.344
Wherever they are,
that is where she will be.

43:00.990 --> 43:03.128
The accused shall be placed
under house arrest

43:03.177 --> 43:05.186
with an electronic monitoring device.

43:05.235 --> 43:06.756
She may love her children,
but any attempt

43:06.805 --> 43:07.865
to make contact with them,

43:07.914 --> 43:09.206
and I will revoke this bail agreement

43:09.255 --> 43:11.038
and place her in remand.

43:11.261 --> 43:13.148
You've been warned, Ms. Chartrand.

43:14.138 --> 43:15.781
Hang tight, OK?

43:16.473 --> 43:18.064
We'll meet you at your house.

43:27.399 --> 43:28.572
What the hell was that?

43:28.621 --> 43:30.720
The bags, the kids, Kodie,

43:30.769 --> 43:32.202
it's all connected.

43:33.650 --> 43:36.002
If they're wrong about Kodie,
they're wrong about all of them.
