WEBVTT

00:37.329 --> 00:38.372
Huh?

00:44.420 --> 00:46.005
Finally awake,

00:46.255 --> 00:47.590
Angel Dust?

00:47.590 --> 00:50.760
Yeah, and what's it to ya?

00:50.760 --> 00:55.473
I want you to
tell me where your boss stashes his vault.

00:55.473 --> 00:57.850
Hehehe!
It's hilarious you think

00:57.850 --> 01:00.227
I'd tell you anything.

01:00.227 --> 01:05.024
Fine. I guess I'll just have
to <i>fuck</i> the information outta ya.

01:05.608 --> 01:08.861
Do your worst, daddy.

01:08.861 --> 01:12.364
<i>...Ohhhh,
yeahhh, baby!</i>

01:12.364 --> 01:14.617
Ya know,
this performance

01:14.617 --> 01:16.494
won me a
'Sex-x-x-i' award!

01:16.494 --> 01:20.122
It's, uh...
very... honest?... Oh.

01:20.122 --> 01:22.541
Ew!

01:23.417 --> 01:25.461
Okay! Enough of that. Angel,
what the fuck?

01:25.461 --> 01:27.797
What?! You said
it was "Show n' Tell" day.

01:27.797 --> 01:29.882
I'm <i>showin</i> ' you my best film,

01:29.882 --> 01:33.511
and I'm <i>tellin'</i> you that it
scored me a win over that bitch,

01:33.511 --> 01:35.513
Tiffany Titfucker.

01:35.513 --> 01:38.557
Ya know, not a very
convincing interrogation scene.

01:38.557 --> 01:41.185
Alright dickhead,

01:41.185 --> 01:44.688
what makes you think you have any
right to insult my work to my fuckin' face?

01:44.688 --> 01:46.690
You really going to sit there
and act like these scripts

01:46.690 --> 01:47.858
ain't hot garbage?

01:47.858 --> 01:49.819
Fuck you.

01:49.819 --> 01:51.403
This is classy art.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.572
<i>OH! FUUUCK!!</i>

01:54.365 --> 01:55.866
That's bullshit.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.785
You get drunk and
bitch about them all the time.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.246
Everyone likes to bitch
to the bartender.

02:00.246 --> 02:03.624
I know everything about
you and these motherfuckers at this point.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.834
That one.

02:04.834 --> 02:06.377
That one is an insecure buffoon

02:06.377 --> 02:09.213
whose lonely ass
watches you idiots sleep!

02:09.213 --> 02:13.592
Princess, is a bleeding heart who wants to
solve everybody else's problems 'cept her own.

02:13.592 --> 02:17.429
What?! No,
I-- what? Pffff, no, no.

02:17.429 --> 02:20.599
This one judges everyone and
everything because she hates herself.

02:20.599 --> 02:21.559
Aargh!

02:21.559 --> 02:22.643
And Niffty.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.228
Hehhh...

02:24.228 --> 02:26.397
You don't even wanna know
what her deal is.

02:27.857 --> 02:29.441
You weren't kidding!

02:29.441 --> 02:31.777
Haha, wow!

02:31.777 --> 02:33.821
Kitten's got <i>claws</i> !

02:33.821 --> 02:35.197
Meow!

02:35.739 --> 02:38.200
And you!

02:38.200 --> 02:41.787
Don't get me started. I see
right through you and all this bullshit

02:41.787 --> 02:43.706
and how fake you are.

02:43.706 --> 02:46.375
Oh, Me? Fake?

02:46.584 --> 02:47.543
Wow.

02:47.543 --> 02:49.545
I had no idea.

02:49.545 --> 02:51.547
Guess that's why I'm an actor.

02:51.547 --> 02:52.882
Dumbass

02:52.882 --> 02:54.383
<i>And</i>--

02:54.383 --> 02:55.634
Hold that thought.

02:55.634 --> 02:56.635
Hello?

02:56.635 --> 02:59.221
Uh, yeah I'm-I'm...

02:59.221 --> 03:00.389
No, No, I just, I...

03:00.389 --> 03:02.558
No, I-I'm not...

03:02.558 --> 03:04.143
But, uh... Yeah,

03:05.227 --> 03:06.478
I'll be right there.

03:06.478 --> 03:07.813
Well, uh,

03:07.813 --> 03:10.399
looks like Val
needs me for an...

03:10.399 --> 03:11.734
Uh-- emergency shoot.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.277
Uh-uh, Sure.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.487
You know what?
Fuck you.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.740
I don't give a shit what some
drunk ass bartender thinks a' me.

03:17.740 --> 03:19.575
So why don't you just crawl back

03:19.575 --> 03:22.244
to whatever cave you came from,
porn critic.

03:22.244 --> 03:23.913
Angel! You can't leave yet.

03:23.913 --> 03:26.916
We haven't finished
our exercises for the day.

03:26.916 --> 03:28.959
I'm sure you'll
manage without me.

03:28.959 --> 03:31.921
There isn't much time left
for the hotel to prove itself.

03:31.921 --> 03:34.340
Dollface, it's my job.

03:34.340 --> 03:37.426
I know you want to fix
everything, but unless you can fix my boss,

03:37.426 --> 03:38.469
there's nothing you can do.

03:39.637 --> 03:42.514
Uuugh, why is this so haaaard?

03:42.514 --> 03:43.599
What am I doing wrong?

03:43.599 --> 03:45.476
Well, I mean...

03:45.476 --> 03:47.478
- you're the princess of Hell,
- So?

03:47.478 --> 03:50.898
So, you don't really use
the power that comes with that,

03:50.898 --> 03:52.483
which I love about you,

03:52.483 --> 03:54.860
but maybe you can...
I don't know,

03:54.860 --> 03:57.363
command
a little more... authority.

03:57.363 --> 03:59.406
But that's so mean.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.033
It's not mean, exactly.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.827
it's... uh,
aggressive kindness.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.704
Okay...

04:05.704 --> 04:09.833
I could be so aggressively kind
to Angel's boss...

04:09.833 --> 04:14.505
that I convince him to let Angel
spend more time at the hotel!

04:14.505 --> 04:16.298
Sure.
Whatever gets you there, babe.

04:17.925 --> 04:23.472
Ohhh! Daddy, I... uhhhh?...

04:23.472 --> 04:26.475
Do you really expect me
to memorize this whole script?

04:26.475 --> 04:27.977
Just improv it.

04:27.977 --> 04:29.979
Do you think anyone watches
for the dialogue?

04:29.979 --> 04:31.313
Action!

04:32.481 --> 04:33.899
Oh, no.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.901
So many burglars...

04:35.901 --> 04:38.445
and only one me!

04:38.654 --> 04:40.698
Whatever shall I do?

04:40.698 --> 04:44.952
I guess I'll
have to do all of you!

04:44.952 --> 04:46.245
Ohh!

04:46.620 --> 04:49.999
So what are you gonna do
ta' me?

04:51.000 --> 04:51.917
Charlie?

04:52.793 --> 04:55.504
- Uh, my name's Rocky.
- No one gives a shit.

04:55.504 --> 04:59.425
Oh, so this is
where the magic happens.

04:59.425 --> 05:01.468
Oh, wow, that is--

05:01.468 --> 05:03.053
That is a lot.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.848
What in the ever-loving fuck
are you doing here?!

05:05.848 --> 05:10.644
I am the Princess of Hell,
Angel. And I go where I please.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.938
I'm here to get you some time
off for the hotel. Now, where's your boss?

05:12.938 --> 05:14.940
Oh, no, no, no,

05:14.940 --> 05:16.108
no, no, no, no, no.
You are going nowhere near Val--

05:16.108 --> 05:17.443
Angel!

05:17.443 --> 05:18.736
What is the fucking hold up?

05:18.736 --> 05:20.446
I'm coming.

05:20.446 --> 05:22.364
Not off camera.
You're not.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.533
Please, please, just wait,
wait until I'm done working

05:24.533 --> 05:26.660
and we will talk about this,
I promise. But first, you've gotta go.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.871
Aaaah, Your Majesty.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.539
Oh, shit.

05:30.539 --> 05:33.542
Welcome to my humble
sex dungeon.

05:33.542 --> 05:36.545
What can I do for such a--

05:36.545 --> 05:37.671
Uh, no, thank you.

05:38.047 --> 05:41.050
Mm! Lovely specimen!

05:41.050 --> 05:43.093
You don't want a role, do you?

05:43.093 --> 05:44.970
Because I could make you a star.

05:44.970 --> 05:47.806
Make us both richer
than, well,

05:47.806 --> 05:49.099
your papito--

05:49.099 --> 05:50.559
Fuck No!

05:50.559 --> 05:52.561
Uh, I-I'm sorry.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.813
I have come to
aggressively, kindly

05:54.813 --> 05:55.981
speak with you about Angel.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.650
Later, of course.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.861
I wouldn't want to stand
in the way of your work.

06:02.488 --> 06:06.784
Well then, make yourself
comfortable, Your Majesty,

06:06.784 --> 06:08.494
and enjoy the show.

06:08.494 --> 06:10.162
Well, let's take
this shit from the top.

06:10.162 --> 06:11.747
Action!

06:11.747 --> 06:15.417
Oh, wow, mister robbers,

06:15.417 --> 06:22.132
I sure hope you don't hurt me
with those... big guns of yours.

06:22.132 --> 06:27.179
Don't move, you spicy
little, uuh, cock sleeve or else I'll...

06:27.179 --> 06:29.515
...We do
trust exercises everyday in the morning...

06:29.515 --> 06:32.559
Cut! What
the fuck is going on with this?

06:32.559 --> 06:35.187
Ooh, I'm sorry.
Were we too loud?

06:35.187 --> 06:37.606
I was just telling him
about the Hazbin Hotel.

06:37.606 --> 06:40.526
Not at all, Princess.

06:40.526 --> 06:43.570
It doesn't bother me one bit.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.573
You know, this scene
feels awfully violent.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.117
If you want
help with the script,

06:48.117 --> 06:50.661
maybe I can pitch
some scenarios that are more--

06:52.913 --> 06:56.959
Okay. Okay. Ah, ah okay,
that's on fire. That-that, that's on fire.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.794
Oh shit...

07:01.004 --> 07:03.465
Oh, god. Okay.
Uh, do you have any--

07:03.465 --> 07:05.467
Can I get a fire extinguisher?

07:05.467 --> 07:07.136
I am <i>so</i> sorry. I ruined
your movie. I ruined your movie.

07:07.136 --> 07:09.972
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm s-s-s-s-s-sorry!

07:09.972 --> 07:10.973
Noooooo!

07:15.060 --> 07:16.854
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

07:16.854 --> 07:19.815
Oh, my gosh.
I am so, so, so, so sorry.

07:19.815 --> 07:21.942
I-- I can clean this up,
I-- I can--

07:21.942 --> 07:24.528
Don't you worry your
pretty blonde head about it.

07:24.528 --> 07:26.655
We have people for that.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.157
Angel,

07:28.157 --> 07:31.702
can I see you in
your dressing room for a moment?

07:35.747 --> 07:37.833
Val, I didn't know that--

07:38.959 --> 07:41.044
Val, I--

07:41.044 --> 07:46.008
You really think you can have
Lucifer's little bitch fight

07:46.008 --> 07:47.968
your battles for you?

07:47.968 --> 07:49.511
Arrgh! Val, please... I'm
sorry she-- -

07:49.511 --> 07:51.513
You bring
her here to protect you?

07:51.513 --> 07:53.432
To fuck with me?

07:54.016 --> 07:55.893
Ow! Val, stop!

07:55.893 --> 07:57.769
You think she can
get you out of work?

07:57.769 --> 08:01.523
No! No, that's not
what I'm trying to do. No--

08:03.233 --> 08:06.278
You know she can't do anything.

08:06.278 --> 08:09.156
I own you.
Or have you forgotten that?

08:10.991 --> 08:12.034
No.

08:12.034 --> 08:14.161
When I say "come", you say?

08:14.161 --> 08:15.954
Yes, Valentino.

08:15.954 --> 08:19.041
When I say "you are
fucking 20 guys before lunch,"

08:19.041 --> 08:21.668
- you say?
- Yes, Valentino.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.046
When I say
"you better get that fucking

08:24.046 --> 08:27.257
<i>cunt out of my studio."</i>

08:27.257 --> 08:29.551
You say?

08:29.551 --> 08:32.054
- I...
- You <i>say</i> ?

08:32.721 --> 08:37.559
Look, Val, she just gets involved in everything.

08:37.559 --> 08:39.937
I'll tell her to leave.
Just don't hurt her.

08:39.937 --> 08:44.066
I have killed bitches for
less than this attitude you're giving me.

08:44.066 --> 08:46.318
You're lucky you make me money.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.237
Now, you're going
to go get rid of her,

08:48.237 --> 08:50.906
and then you are
filming all night.

08:50.906 --> 08:52.032
Get me?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.242
Yes, Val.

08:53.242 --> 08:54.743
Good.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.791
All right.

09:00.791 --> 09:04.127
Get your asses back on set, and
we are taking this from the top.

09:04.127 --> 09:07.089
What makes you think
you can treat him like that?

09:07.089 --> 09:09.091
Charlie!
Just stop!

09:09.091 --> 09:11.677
Angel, what are you talking ab--

09:11.677 --> 09:12.844
Charlie, Leave!

09:12.844 --> 09:14.179
But...

09:14.179 --> 09:15.180
I didn't want you ta come here.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.642
I already asked you to leave
and you didn't listen.

09:18.642 --> 09:19.893
You made things worse.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.311
I just wanted to help you.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.271
Well, you <i>ain't!</i>

09:22.771 --> 09:24.356
You actually want to help me?

09:24.356 --> 09:26.066
Get the <i>fuck</i> out of here!

09:26.775 --> 09:29.278
Right now, and
let me finish my work.

09:29.278 --> 09:32.948
I... I didn't...

09:32.948 --> 09:37.911
mean to!
I... I'm... I'm so sorry.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.334
Good boy.

09:44.334 --> 09:48.255

Eugh,

11:53.130 --> 11:54.756
I need a drink.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.091
The hardest you can make.

11:56.091 --> 11:58.427
Hmm.
You look like shit.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.848
Pfft. Not possible.

12:02.848 --> 12:04.474
Just a long shoot,

12:04.474 --> 12:06.101
nothin' new.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.106
Eugh, I said a strong one.

12:11.106 --> 12:13.275
Excuse me.

12:13.275 --> 12:15.110
Didn't realize this was
a "drinking to forget" kind of night.

12:15.110 --> 12:19.239
Oh, I forgot.
You're the wise old bartender

12:19.239 --> 12:21.867
who's seen it all.

12:21.867 --> 12:24.453
Get the fuck over yourself
and pour me a real drink.

12:24.453 --> 12:26.496
Look, if you got a problem,

12:26.496 --> 12:29.207
you're not going to find
the solution at the bottom of a bottle.

12:29.207 --> 12:31.376
I should know, I've
been looking there a long time.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.295
Oh sure,

12:33.295 --> 12:34.963
And where should I look? Hmm?

12:34.963 --> 12:36.798
In your bedroom, maybe?

12:36.798 --> 12:38.884
Under the covers?

12:38.884 --> 12:40.969
Maybe we can go
and look together.

12:40.969 --> 12:43.054
Don't even start.

12:43.054 --> 12:47.851
Oh, c'mon, I bet
I can make those wings flap!

12:47.851 --> 12:49.144
Stop!

12:49.144 --> 12:50.395
Fucking Christ!

12:50.395 --> 12:52.272
You can cut the act already.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.065
It's never going to work on me.
So all you're doing

12:54.065 --> 12:56.151
is makin' an ass out of yourself
with this fake bullshit.

12:56.151 --> 12:57.819
Call me fake one more time,

12:57.819 --> 12:58.820
mother fucker!

12:58.820 --> 12:59.571
I dare you!

13:00.989 --> 13:02.157
Fake.

13:02.157 --> 13:03.575
Fuckin' asshole

13:03.575 --> 13:05.827
Arrgh!
God!

13:05.827 --> 13:07.037
Ya done?

13:07.037 --> 13:09.164
Ya know what?

13:09.164 --> 13:12.334
<i>You</i> would be fucking l<i>ucky</i>
to get a chance to fuck me!

13:12.334 --> 13:14.586
Ya know how much I'm worth?

13:14.586 --> 13:19.132
Ya know how many people would
kill to have Angel Dust come onto them?

13:19.841 --> 13:21.218
Fuck you!

13:21.218 --> 13:23.178
Have fun being
a lonely piece of shit.

13:23.178 --> 13:26.097
Woah-- the hell?
Angel, where are you going?

13:26.097 --> 13:27.140
Out!

13:27.140 --> 13:28.850
Husk, what did you do?

13:28.850 --> 13:29.851
Made him a drink.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.895
Oh, no.

13:31.895 --> 13:33.355
He looked really upset.

13:33.355 --> 13:35.190
It's just Angel.
He'll be fine.

13:35.190 --> 13:36.775
I'm not so sure.

13:37.567 --> 13:40.862
I really messed up at the
studio today and he got...

13:41.446 --> 13:44.324
Ugh, it was...
it wasn't good, okay?

13:44.324 --> 13:45.992
Gee, sounds like

13:45.992 --> 13:47.452
someone should go after him...

13:48.870 --> 13:51.164
Someone named "Husk".

13:51.164 --> 13:54.209
Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding
me. Why don't you go if you're so worried?

13:54.209 --> 13:57.212
Because I'm not the one
who sent him storming out.

13:57.212 --> 13:59.214
You caused it.
You drag him back.

13:59.214 --> 14:01.216
No! No...

14:01.216 --> 14:02.926
Don't force him back.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.928
Just make sure he's safe.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.264
I pushed too hard earlier and...

14:07.264 --> 14:09.057
I only made things worse.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.184
Look, he'll come
back when he's ready.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.563
I just don't want anything
to happen to him until then.

14:16.439 --> 14:19.985
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm
going to go write 100

14:19.985 --> 14:22.529
apology letters and a lesson
plan for tomorrow about...

14:22.529 --> 14:25.323
boundaries.

14:28.410 --> 14:31.246
Oh, yeah.

14:33.498 --> 14:36.334
I'm so fucked up!

14:36.334 --> 14:37.252
Gimme a whiskey...

14:38.545 --> 14:41.339
I meant
the whole bottle, jackass.

14:41.339 --> 14:44.384
...
Haha, ya, ya, so I said

14:44.384 --> 14:47.637
"You couldn't afford
me in a million afterlives!"

14:47.637 --> 14:50.181
I got better options,
right boys?

14:50.181 --> 14:51.558
You got that right!

14:51.558 --> 14:53.226
Hey, baby,

14:53.226 --> 14:55.437
be a doll and
bring me another one?

14:55.437 --> 14:56.980
Daddy's outta juice!

15:07.449 --> 15:09.284
Here you go, darling.

15:09.284 --> 15:12.078
Just for you--
Woah!

15:12.287 --> 15:14.122
Nice try, fuckhead.

15:17.709 --> 15:20.253
- Let's go.
- What the? Hey!

15:21.087 --> 15:22.297
H-h-hey, hey!

15:23.632 --> 15:25.592
Husk! What the
actual <i>fuck</i> are you doing here?

15:25.592 --> 15:27.218
Let go of me.

15:27.218 --> 15:29.179
No, I'm
takin' you back to the hotel.

15:29.179 --> 15:30.972
Get off!

15:30.972 --> 15:32.974
That fucker put
somethin' in yer drink.

15:32.974 --> 15:35.185
You don't think I can tell
if someone spikes my drink?

15:35.185 --> 15:36.686
I do this all the fuckin' time.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.688
You just let people drug you
all the time?

15:38.688 --> 15:42.484
You think I ask for it? I don't
ask for any of this shit!

15:42.484 --> 15:44.611
I didn't ask to be this way.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.488
I didn't ask for
Charlie to save me.

15:46.488 --> 15:48.531
I didn't ask for <i>you</i> to save me.

15:48.531 --> 15:51.034
I can handle myself.

15:51.034 --> 15:54.663
Really? Because I just
saw someone self-destructing.

15:54.663 --> 15:57.457
It seems like--
I don't know.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.502
Ya might need a
bartender to talk to.

16:00.502 --> 16:02.587
Oh, so now you're going to act

16:02.587 --> 16:05.131
like you give a shit about me?

16:05.131 --> 16:09.260
You think after how you treated
me, I'm gonna to open up to you? Please.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.638
Maybe I'd treat you better
if you were real,

16:11.638 --> 16:13.682
and not some bullshit
version of yourself.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.684
Always pushin' my boundaries.

16:15.684 --> 16:19.145
Lemme tell ya, nobody in
that hotel cares who you are.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.730
How famous, how hot.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.358
So you might as well
just cut the act.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.111
It's not an act!

16:26.111 --> 16:28.196
It's who I need to be.

16:28.196 --> 16:29.364
And <i>this...</i>

16:29.364 --> 16:30.990
This is my escape!

16:31.366 --> 16:33.493
Where I can forget about it all!

16:33.493 --> 16:35.203
How much I hate...

16:35.704 --> 16:37.580
everything.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.541
A place where I can get high,

16:39.541 --> 16:42.335
and not have to think about
how much it hurts.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.045
And maybe...

16:44.045 --> 16:46.506
if I can ruin myself
enough in the process,

16:46.506 --> 16:48.091
if I end up broken,

16:48.091 --> 16:50.343
I won't be
his favorite toy anymore.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.513
And maybe he'll let me go.

16:59.728 --> 17:01.730
I was an Overlord once,
you know.

17:02.564 --> 17:03.440
Yeah,

17:04.232 --> 17:05.108
and uh...

17:06.067 --> 17:08.194
It was nice to have that power.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.780
But when you're
dealing in souls,

17:10.780 --> 17:13.408
while also being a gambler,

17:13.408 --> 17:15.493
the stakes are pretty high.

17:15.493 --> 17:19.038
And losing a few hands can
be more than a little dangerous.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.666
So when you're
down on your luck,

17:21.666 --> 17:25.462
you turn to anything
to... keep you afloat,

17:25.462 --> 17:28.757
even making deals yourself.

17:28.757 --> 17:31.593
So I know what it's like to...

17:31.593 --> 17:36.181
regret the choices made and...

17:36.514 --> 17:39.058

21:24.617 --> 21:26.494
He had,
like, three bills,

21:26.494 --> 21:27.578
and it took him, like,

21:27.578 --> 21:28.997
30 minutes to count it.

21:28.997 --> 21:31.416
His eyes are <i>so</i> shit.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.334
And this is the guy
you got to take orders from?

21:33.334 --> 21:34.502
I know.

21:34.502 --> 21:36.587
What a fucking joke, right?

21:36.587 --> 21:39.632
I'm <i>so</i> sorry, Angel.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.509
I promise I won't ever,

21:41.509 --> 21:43.344
ever, ever, ever-

21:43.344 --> 21:44.262
Charlie,

21:44.595 --> 21:46.681
it's fine. I get it.

21:47.932 --> 21:48.850
Thanks...

21:49.559 --> 21:50.768
for carin' about me.

21:56.607 --> 21:58.901
Ehhhhh... I think this is yours.

21:58.901 --> 22:02.071
Okay
missy, let's get you to bed.

22:02.071 --> 22:09.662
He-- he-- said--
he--for-forgave meee!

22:09.662 --> 22:13.499
Oh, it's so beautiful Vaggie!

22:15.043 --> 22:17.462
Hey, how about that drink.

22:17.462 --> 22:19.589
You read my mind.
