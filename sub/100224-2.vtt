00:18.936 --> 00:19.937
Hello?

00:20.354 --> 00:23.023
Hello.
This is a prepaid collect call from--

00:23.106 --> 00:24.942
California State Penitentiary.

00:25.025 --> 00:28.028
To accept charges, press one.
To review char--

00:31.532 --> 00:33.033
Hey, baby.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.702
Why didn't you tell me?

00:40.040 --> 00:41.625
I didn't want you to know.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.295
So what was your plan?

00:46.630 --> 00:48.799
Just one day
you'd just never show up again?

00:50.092 --> 00:54.888
Have some chaplain come into my cell,
who I don't know,

00:54.972 --> 00:56.348
to tell me the news?

00:58.058 --> 01:01.353
I didn't think... I didn't want--

01:04.522 --> 01:05.357
Mom.

01:10.863 --> 01:14.199
I used to do this when you first came home
from the hospital--

01:14.616 --> 01:17.160
listen to you breathe.

01:23.125 --> 01:24.751
Time's up, Cave. Let's go.

01:28.964 --> 01:30.799
So what kind of cancer?

01:32.634 --> 01:34.136
How long did they say?

01:35.137 --> 01:37.306
Don't worry about that. Just don't worry.

01:42.686 --> 01:45.105
I... I gotta go.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.120
I love you too.

02:04.208 --> 02:06.502
Nobody gives a fuck your mama got cancer.

02:07.252 --> 02:08.294
Hey.

03:28.876 --> 03:32.963
If I host this dinner
for your new colleagues, razzle-dazzle...

03:33.046 --> 03:35.424
-Razzle-dazzle.
-Do all that Georgetown Poppy stuff.

03:35.507 --> 03:36.508
That's right.

03:36.592 --> 03:39.928
I can eliminate a week on the Vineyard
with your snotty-ass mother.

03:40.012 --> 03:42.764
Wait, now,
I didn't say anything like that.

03:42.848 --> 03:46.226
Well, that was my interpretation.
I thought we were horse trading.

03:46.310 --> 03:49.855
You're going to extort me so that you
don't have to spend time with my mother?

03:52.065 --> 03:56.236
The grand duchess has never liked me,
and you know it.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.031
And now that I've dragged her baby boy
all the way across the country,

03:59.114 --> 04:00.449
she'll be waiting to skin me alive.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.409
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is and you know it.

04:08.707 --> 04:09.791
Here we go.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.673
Can I speak to you for a moment?

04:19.551 --> 04:20.552
Can I help you?

04:21.094 --> 04:22.888
Ms. Parnell, I'm Owen Cave.

04:23.388 --> 04:28.060
You've spoken to my ex-wife
and my son, Warren.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.478
Menlo Park.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.438
Long way from home.

04:31.522 --> 04:34.274
Are you here as an officer or as a father?

04:35.692 --> 04:38.487
I'm here to give your wife the opportunity
to do the right thing.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.198
That's the point of my work.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.785
Ms. Parnell, you're digging into
a painful period for a lot of people.

04:46.203 --> 04:47.913
Some of us still haven't healed.

04:48.247 --> 04:49.748
I heard your podcast.

04:49.831 --> 04:53.544
I just don't understand why you wanna
open all that up again in such a...

04:54.670 --> 04:55.838
public fashion.

04:55.921 --> 04:59.550
Because I think there's a good chance
your son is innocent.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.844
You know, for years after the trial...

05:03.345 --> 05:06.139
I actually dreamed
that I found another clue,

05:06.223 --> 05:09.059
some new piece of evidence
that would point me away from Warren.

05:09.852 --> 05:11.895
And I would've loved to have discovered

05:11.979 --> 05:15.148
that I made the biggest mistake
of my career in that investigation.

05:15.232 --> 05:19.528
But that was a fantasy that I had to stop
allowing myself to indulge in.

05:20.696 --> 05:21.989
I had to move on.

05:22.573 --> 05:23.824
All of us did.

05:24.241 --> 05:29.705
Now, I'm asking you, as a father,
not as a uniform, to stop.

05:30.998 --> 05:31.999
Please.

05:33.876 --> 05:35.085
I can't do that.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.421
What if I'm right?

05:37.504 --> 05:38.922
What if you did make a mistake?

05:39.256 --> 05:41.091
My son deserves to be in prison.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.887
And you're gonna come to the same
conclusion because it's the truth.

05:54.521 --> 05:57.524
Now that just turned us
from the new people in the neighborhood

05:57.608 --> 05:59.651
to the black people in the neighborhood.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.405
Now, Owen doesn't like me digging.

06:04.031 --> 06:08.285
Now. One at a time. Owen, Lanie--

06:08.368 --> 06:11.455
She called me back, by the way.
She left a very clear message.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.833
"Fuck you." And if we keep bothering her,
she'll file a restraining order.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.085
I'm gonna ask Markus to look into--

06:17.169 --> 06:18.253
Markus?

06:18.670 --> 06:20.130
As in "used to make your knees go weak,

06:20.214 --> 06:22.216
drive by his house
in the middle of the night" Markus?

06:22.299 --> 06:24.510
-That's interesting.
-That was 20 years ago.

06:24.593 --> 06:27.638
When we first met, we bonded over
being the new girls in the boys' club.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.431
Do you remember the other thing
that brought us together?

06:30.224 --> 06:34.144
Louisiana roots.
That crappy, no-hot-water apartment.

06:34.770 --> 06:37.940
Bulletproof Chinese food
from that janky restaurant on the corner.

06:39.274 --> 06:40.317
Broken hearts.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.361
We met post-Markus.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.863
I was there for the oil spill
that was you.

06:45.697 --> 06:46.949
Tread lightly.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.034
-Okay.
-Okay.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.205
Lanie's aunt.

06:53.288 --> 06:54.581
Susan Carver.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.792
She was at the trial every day,

06:56.875 --> 07:01.547
and in these photos,
she looks particularly close to the twins.

07:01.630 --> 07:04.424
Her social media
is filled with pics of them as kids.

07:04.508 --> 07:06.426
Schoolteacher, no kids of her own.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.137
You know who never gave a statement?

07:10.472 --> 07:11.473
Josie? Really?

07:12.808 --> 07:16.937
Her mom said she was too fragile, and
the cops said they had enough information.

07:25.988 --> 07:27.072
Yes?

07:27.155 --> 07:29.241
Are the rumors true
about why you left the OPD?

07:29.324 --> 07:32.744
Are the rumors true why you ran away
from the West Coast all those years ago?

07:33.579 --> 07:35.289
Tou-motherfucking-chÃ©.

07:36.290 --> 07:37.583
What you need, Pop?

07:37.666 --> 07:39.293
My new series...

07:39.376 --> 07:41.211
Yeah, about Warren Cave. I listened.

07:43.005 --> 07:45.299
Are you familiar with his father, Owen?

07:45.382 --> 07:47.176
Chief of Police, Menlo Park.

07:49.011 --> 07:50.429
So you did listen.

07:50.512 --> 07:54.308
Well he gave me the full-court press
today, trying to get me to back off.

07:54.391 --> 07:57.519
I wanna know why he doesn't
want me digging into his son's case.

07:57.603 --> 07:59.438
Well, you stay putting your foot in it.

07:59.521 --> 08:00.564
Are you in or not?

08:00.647 --> 08:02.983
So this mean we back together again?

08:03.066 --> 08:04.610
Working together.

08:05.611 --> 08:07.029
Yeah, right. That's what they all say.

08:07.112 --> 08:10.282
Then all of a sudden, it's "Markus.
Markus, please. Markus, please.

08:10.365 --> 08:11.825
I need some more of your time."

08:11.909 --> 08:13.827
Why are you terrible?

08:13.911 --> 08:15.037
Anything else?

08:15.621 --> 08:17.748
One more thing. No, two.

08:17.831 --> 08:18.832
Hit me.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.752
Chuck's sister-in-law, Susan Carver.

08:21.835 --> 08:25.339
I've been trying to reach her
and one of the daughters, Lanie Buhrman.

08:25.422 --> 08:28.133
Both are in South Bay,
both are stonewalling me,

08:28.217 --> 08:32.346
and I need one or the other
to help me find the missing twin.

08:32.429 --> 08:37.643
Look, I need to talk to anybody that
might have information to clear Warren.

08:38.058 --> 08:40.020
-What do you think?
-I will help you out.

08:40.102 --> 08:43.106
You know, it might be nice for me
to flex that muscle again.

08:43.607 --> 08:46.235
But I gotta warn you, baby, I ain't cheap.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.054
What are you doing here?

09:15.514 --> 09:16.598
You don't look so good.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.725
All right, put that out.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.230
What do you want, Lanie?

09:23.647 --> 09:27.192
A reporter came to see me last week.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.070
Did you point her in my direction?

09:30.153 --> 09:32.489
She thinks that your son is innocent.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.032
So do I.

09:34.825 --> 09:36.285
The state didn't.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.789
Well, the state's gotten
a lot of things wrong, haven't they?

09:40.873 --> 09:43.917
Like your mental health.

09:45.210 --> 09:47.880
You think all the secrets came out
during the trial?

09:56.263 --> 09:57.306
Thought so.

09:58.432 --> 10:01.894
Are you here to threaten me?
It's not gonna work.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.984
It's cute that you believe that.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.363
Good for you.

10:28.462 --> 10:31.465
When you're a kid and your parent dies,

10:31.548 --> 10:35.844
it feels like everything
that was once solid shatters.

10:35.928 --> 10:37.596
The ground becomes quicksand.

10:37.679 --> 10:42.142
You experience
the constant sensation of falling.

10:44.269 --> 10:46.313
I know that feeling well.

10:47.648 --> 10:51.235
I was nine when I lost my mother.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.904
But what I don't know is how it feels

10:53.987 --> 10:58.075
when your parent dies
in a horrifically violent manner.

10:58.951 --> 11:01.870
Chuck! Chuck! Oh, my God!

11:01.954 --> 11:04.456
The young women
at the center of this story do know.

11:04.540 --> 11:05.791
Oh, my God!

11:05.874 --> 11:08.710
According to police testimony
and the prosecution,

11:08.794 --> 11:13.799
Chuck's daughters awaken the morning
after Halloween to their mother's screams.

11:13.882 --> 11:16.677
-Josie. Josie, get up. Josie, get up.
-What?

11:16.760 --> 11:19.638
Oh, no!

11:21.014 --> 11:22.015
Daddy!

11:24.101 --> 11:26.270
He's dead, he's dead.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.605
Oh, no! Oh, my God.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.023
He's dead!

11:31.191 --> 11:32.192
Mom?

11:33.068 --> 11:34.278
My husband!

11:34.361 --> 11:36.071
-A knife. I don't know.
-No!

11:38.782 --> 11:42.035
-Come on, go upstairs. No, no, no.
-Please, don't-- No!

11:43.245 --> 11:47.374
Despite the old detective adage
that the first place to look

11:47.457 --> 11:49.960
when someone gets killed in the home
is the family...

11:50.961 --> 11:55.132
Erin Buhrman and her daughters
were quickly ruled out as suspects.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.216
Why?

11:57.384 --> 11:59.803
Lanie testified on the record.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.181
Josie did not.

12:03.473 --> 12:06.435
And she never attended the trial.
Not once.

12:06.852 --> 12:09.897
Not even the day
the guilty verdict was read.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.859
In fact,
the last time anyone saw Josie Buhrman

12:13.942 --> 12:15.861
was at her high school graduation.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.488
Why is Josie hiding?

12:24.870 --> 12:27.122
Try Lanie again, then Susan, then Lanie.

12:27.206 --> 12:29.124
We'll tag-team till one of them talks.

12:29.458 --> 12:30.667
We've gotta find Josie.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.577
I don't understand why you
putting them on blast like that.

13:05.661 --> 13:09.081
Do you even know what I do,
what I've done for the past 20 years?

13:09.164 --> 13:10.707
You get in people's business.

13:10.791 --> 13:11.834
Stop.

13:12.251 --> 13:17.047
I'm serious. If that twin is hiding,
it's because she doesn't wanna be found.

13:18.090 --> 13:21.426
How you gonna force somebody to talk
about the worst shit in their lives?

13:21.510 --> 13:23.887
Twelve dollars for some cherries?
What the fuck?

13:25.180 --> 13:28.100
Look, the girl is hiding for a reason.
That's all we're saying.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.394
Then I want her to tell me about it.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.603
Why?

13:31.687 --> 13:34.815
What if someone came to you and asked you
how you felt when your mother died?

13:36.275 --> 13:37.609
See, that's what I'm talking about.

13:37.693 --> 13:39.903
See, I was with you
until you brought up Mama.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.617
You doing an awful lot for this white boy.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.411
I think he's innocent.

13:47.494 --> 13:51.832
So what? He's AB, Poppy.
If Daddy finds out about that--

13:51.915 --> 13:53.333
Daddy find out about what?

13:53.417 --> 13:54.543
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

14:04.970 --> 14:07.681
I don't know, Lanie. Maybe we talk to her.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.141
Yeah, we can't do that.

14:10.058 --> 14:13.353
I watch these news programs
and I see the documentaries and the books,

14:13.437 --> 14:15.772
and they make pain romantic.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.525
And it's not.
It's just pain, and we should say that.

14:18.609 --> 14:22.571
If we talk, it's red meat, okay?
Then it never stops.

14:23.864 --> 14:27.201
And what about Josie? Huh?
Could she find her?

14:28.702 --> 14:31.455
If she looked hard enough,
could she find her?

14:32.164 --> 14:33.165
Josie's safe.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.085
I really need to talk to her, okay?

14:37.169 --> 14:39.963
You know you can't do that. Just leave her
alone. She's fine where she is.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.757
Where is that? Where?

14:41.840 --> 14:43.926
-We're not having this conversation again.
-God!

14:44.009 --> 14:45.427
Don't touch me.

14:45.511 --> 14:46.595
Calm down.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.850
Wait. Is that her?

14:58.899 --> 15:00.025
Oh, shit.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.319
-Hey, you guys okay?
-Oh, shit.

15:02.903 --> 15:03.904
Oh, shit.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.698
Call 911. Call 911!

15:08.534 --> 15:11.078
You guys okay? Can you get out? Hang on.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.501
You're not complaining about the price
now that it's in your belly.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.044
Didn't say it wasn't good.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.296
What's going on with Daddy?

15:23.340 --> 15:26.009
Daddy's, you know, Daddy.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.302
No, he's not.

15:27.761 --> 15:30.514
For a minute at the party,
he didn't know me.

15:31.223 --> 15:32.266
He was drunk, Pop.

15:32.349 --> 15:35.394
-No, he wasn't. What he said to me--
-You pissed him off.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.980
-You piss everybody off.
-Just like you doing with the Buhrmans.

15:38.063 --> 15:40.899
I'm just concerned about Daddy's health.
Why are you so defensive?

15:40.983 --> 15:43.569
'Cause you push on people
until they just wanna... You know?

15:43.652 --> 15:46.446
Okay, I'm not trying
to step on anybody's toes.

15:46.530 --> 15:48.323
I know y'all been holding it down here.

15:48.657 --> 15:50.701
Daddy just seemed off to me.

15:51.285 --> 15:52.995
When was the last time he saw a doctor?

15:55.789 --> 15:57.749
I got some business
I need to take care of.

15:57.833 --> 15:59.626
Need to get across the bridge
before it gets backed up.

15:59.710 --> 16:03.338
Black people love doing shit like this.
Avoid, avoid, avoid.

16:03.714 --> 16:06.633
-Look, you can't ignore this.
-Watch me.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.929
We came over here to have
a nice day with our sister, that's all.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.055
A nice day with you.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.267
The next time you wanna lecture us,
drive to Oakland.

16:15.350 --> 16:16.685
Gas costs money.

16:17.102 --> 16:18.187
Come if you coming.

16:20.189 --> 16:21.273
You're ignoring me too?

16:23.192 --> 16:24.193
Poppy.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.863
You haven't been back full-time
for six months.

16:28.906 --> 16:32.451
We've been doing life here in Cali
while you were back east just fine.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.411
Works for everybody but you.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.246
I'm just saying look out for Daddy.

16:36.330 --> 16:37.664
-Okay.
-Okay, what?

16:37.748 --> 16:41.168
Okay. You said it. Now let it go.

16:43.587 --> 16:45.964
You know it don't take nothing
for that one to get up in the cut,

16:46.048 --> 16:47.424
stop answering her phone.

16:49.843 --> 16:52.429
Look, we all wanna be happy
that you're back.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.057
Okay?

16:57.976 --> 16:59.269
Yeah.

17:00.562 --> 17:02.022
-Love you.
-Love you too.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.826
-Hey.
-There's been an accident, Pop.

17:15.242 --> 17:18.372
Lanie's in the hospital and...
Susan's dead.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.389
She dropped her phone.

17:36.014 --> 17:39.351
I told her to pull over.
She wouldn't do it. It fell...

17:40.894 --> 17:42.646
I don't know, but--

17:42.729 --> 17:44.147
Can we do this later?

17:44.773 --> 17:46.775
I think we've got everything we need here.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.240
Hey.

17:59.288 --> 18:01.290
You took Susan's phone?

18:01.373 --> 18:03.709
Is that the kind of stuff
that got you kicked off the force?

18:03.792 --> 18:06.712
-Do you want the damn thing, or don't you?
-I don't know.

18:06.795 --> 18:09.965
Isn't this a, uh,
"by any means necessary" situation?

18:10.507 --> 18:13.051
Right? 'Cause that's what you're selling
on your podcast.

18:13.135 --> 18:15.888
It's like your life depends on it
as much as his.

18:18.473 --> 18:19.808
Come on, girl, I--

18:20.309 --> 18:21.810
You gotta help me out here.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.858
All right, let me ask you a question.

18:28.525 --> 18:31.320
Cave is housed in San Quentin, right?

18:31.403 --> 18:32.613
-Yeah.
-So he's AB.

18:32.696 --> 18:34.364
Does your father know about that?

18:35.574 --> 18:36.575
No.

18:38.410 --> 18:42.623
So you're out here on a limb,
and now I'm out here with you.

18:43.790 --> 18:47.669
Look, we've been down this road before.

18:49.004 --> 18:50.339
Don't leave me hanging.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.890
They were fighting in the car.
I could see it from where I was.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.100
I told the cops everything I knew.

19:02.184 --> 19:06.021
I even stayed around a little while
just to... get my head together.

19:06.396 --> 19:08.774
That's when I saw the phone in the weeds.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.492
There's no pass code.

19:19.952 --> 19:22.496
There should be enough there
to help you tell your story.

19:22.579 --> 19:23.622
Markus...

19:23.705 --> 19:25.499
He better be innocent.

19:26.458 --> 19:27.876
All right, Pop? 'Cause...

19:29.586 --> 19:30.754
you already know.

19:42.891 --> 19:46.228
Let's just see if there's anything
that could help us find Josie,

19:46.311 --> 19:47.938
and then we'll get it back to the family.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.440
-Is he still in love with you?
-No.

19:51.066 --> 19:52.442
Well, he did this.

19:53.944 --> 19:55.070
What?

19:55.153 --> 19:57.322
Lanie went through a blonde phase.

19:58.490 --> 20:00.784
This woman is very put together.

20:01.326 --> 20:02.536
Wait a minute.

20:03.453 --> 20:06.623
That's Josie. And that's New York.

20:06.707 --> 20:09.960
Look, it's one of those private parks.
We don't have those in California.

20:10.836 --> 20:13.422
Look at those West Indian nannies
sitting on that bench.

20:14.173 --> 20:16.842
That is also not a Bay Area thing.

20:17.968 --> 20:20.387
Make a list of all the New York numbers
in the phone and start calling.

20:23.557 --> 20:26.518
Josie is the key. I need to talk to her.

20:28.854 --> 20:32.649
She's getting married.
Text chain. New York area code.

20:33.108 --> 20:34.735
She's listed as Vivienne Parr.

20:40.115 --> 20:41.116
Bingo.

20:41.909 --> 20:46.955
My first wife died
when Mason was five months old.

20:47.039 --> 20:49.625
Vivienne is the only mother
he's ever known.

20:49.708 --> 20:51.335
He was two when we met.

20:52.794 --> 20:55.047
What's your central parenting philosophy?

20:56.089 --> 20:57.216
Attachment parenting.

20:57.633 --> 20:59.718
Mason's already lost one maternal figure,

20:59.801 --> 21:03.805
so I think that it's imperative
he feels as close to me as possible.

21:03.889 --> 21:05.974
Which means he sleeps with us a lot.

21:06.808 --> 21:07.809
He does.

21:08.227 --> 21:12.856
But even at four,
he's emotionally intelligent.

21:12.940 --> 21:15.108
He knows what he needs
to feel safe and secure.

21:15.192 --> 21:16.610
I love that about him.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.445
He's a very thoughtful boy.

21:18.529 --> 21:19.738
Are you a British citizen?

21:20.489 --> 21:23.242
I'm from Esher. Just outside London.

21:23.951 --> 21:25.619
Any plans to go back and forth?

21:25.702 --> 21:30.249
No. No. Our lives are here.
Both my parents are gone.

21:30.332 --> 21:33.627
I'm an only child, so-- Sorry.

21:36.046 --> 21:37.714
Please leave a message.

21:37.798 --> 21:39.216
Hi, Josie--

21:40.217 --> 21:41.844
Vivienne.

21:41.927 --> 21:43.762
This is Poppy Parnell.

21:43.846 --> 21:49.059
I would love to give you the opportunity
to discuss your father's story.

21:49.643 --> 21:52.980
I'm sending you a link for an upcoming
episode of my podcast

21:53.063 --> 21:54.731
I think you'll want to hear.

21:55.357 --> 21:58.485
I need your help filling in the blanks.

22:15.419 --> 22:18.213
How could the entire Buhrman family,

22:18.297 --> 22:23.802
a mother and two daughters,
sleep through such a violent encounter?

22:24.887 --> 22:28.640
All attempts to locate Josie Buhrman
have led to dead ends.

22:28.724 --> 22:32.436
Is she alive? Is she in hiding?
We'd like to know.

22:32.519 --> 22:36.023
So, Josie, if you're out there,
if you're listening,

22:36.106 --> 22:39.234
you might be the key
to Warren Cave's innocence.

22:40.068 --> 22:41.737
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

22:50.704 --> 22:53.248
-Did you search her bedroom?
-No.

22:54.041 --> 22:55.167
Was it locked?

22:55.584 --> 22:57.920
No. Your aunt was a private person.

22:58.420 --> 23:01.089
-This feels disrespectful.
-Fine. I'll do it.

23:01.173 --> 23:03.717
-Lanie--
-Her phone wasn't with her stuff, okay?

23:03.800 --> 23:06.386
The cops said maybe it was lost
in the wreckage.

23:06.470 --> 23:08.055
The wreckage is not in Susan's bedroom.

23:08.138 --> 23:11.725
I understand that. But maybe there's
something about Josie in there.

23:11.808 --> 23:13.894
-If you don't wanna help me--
-I wanna help ya.

23:13.977 --> 23:15.395
Then do it!

23:15.479 --> 23:18.232
I'm not a vase. I'm not gonna shatter.

23:27.574 --> 23:31.161
Hey. hey, hey, just--

23:38.460 --> 23:39.795
You still in pain?

23:39.878 --> 23:40.879
No.

23:57.229 --> 23:59.147
She needs to know about Susan.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.150
Even if she doesn't wanna see me.

24:04.111 --> 24:06.196
I think you should
leave your sister alone.

24:07.281 --> 24:09.533
She doesn't wanna be found.
You should respect that.

24:10.784 --> 24:12.286
How could you say that to me?

24:13.328 --> 24:14.663
Because it's the truth.

24:16.331 --> 24:19.877
Because I love you
and I don't wanna see you get hurt.

24:23.005 --> 24:24.882
You really can't tell you two apart.

24:28.635 --> 24:29.887
Yeah, nobody could.

24:31.889 --> 24:33.140
Is this one you?

24:35.225 --> 24:36.226
Yeah.

24:38.854 --> 24:41.565
You're sitting next to the same kid
in every one of these pics.

24:41.899 --> 24:44.318
Kindergarten, first grade, second, third.

24:45.652 --> 24:46.695
What?

24:48.363 --> 24:49.823
That's Warren Cave.

24:54.494 --> 24:55.829
We used to be friends.

24:59.082 --> 25:03.337
What did you think when you watched
your father testify against you?

25:05.547 --> 25:09.134
I wondered if I was really his son.

25:11.553 --> 25:13.347
Were you close growing up?

25:14.473 --> 25:16.517
He wasn't around much, but...

25:17.684 --> 25:22.397
I asked for a police scanner when I was 11
so I could go on patrol...

25:23.941 --> 25:25.192
with him.

25:26.902 --> 25:29.905
I actually thought it was cool
that my dad was a cop.

25:30.739 --> 25:33.367
Why do you think any man,
a lawman no less,

25:33.450 --> 25:39.665
would testify against his own son if
he wasn't absolutely sure he was guilty?

25:40.249 --> 25:43.794
I've been asking myself
that same question for 20 years.

25:44.545 --> 25:45.546
And?

25:46.380 --> 25:48.340
He must know something I don't.

25:59.852 --> 26:01.186
Good boy.

26:35.262 --> 26:36.388
I've tried to see you.

26:38.182 --> 26:39.850
You denied my request.

26:42.519 --> 26:44.062
-This time, I thought I--
-Twice.

26:48.901 --> 26:52.654
You tried to see me twice
since you put me in here.

27:05.918 --> 27:07.419
I need to talk to you.

27:14.343 --> 27:17.638
Stop talking to that woman.
She's using you.

27:18.055 --> 27:21.892
She's gonna turn you into a circus clown,
then make a fool outta you.

27:21.975 --> 27:24.061
So you're here to protect me?

27:25.187 --> 27:26.605
After 19 years?

27:28.524 --> 27:29.608
Bullshit.

27:32.486 --> 27:34.154
Don't drag us through this again.

27:35.405 --> 27:37.866
You've ruined enough lives already.
You have a little brother now.

27:37.950 --> 27:39.868
-Who I've never met.
-What about your mother?

27:39.952 --> 27:41.453
You don't give a shit about her.

27:44.581 --> 27:45.916
He hasn't changed.

27:47.584 --> 27:50.546
He'll never change. It's all right.

27:50.629 --> 27:52.840
How do you think
you got into this dog program?

27:52.923 --> 27:54.758
Because of your outstanding character?

27:55.759 --> 27:56.844
That was me.

27:58.178 --> 28:00.764
I may not have been here,
but I haven't forgotten you.

28:02.516 --> 28:03.934
I've done what I could to--

28:10.440 --> 28:11.900
What are you hiding?

28:16.572 --> 28:17.698
You leave it.

28:18.574 --> 28:20.784
Or I can make your life miserable in here.

28:25.038 --> 28:26.582
Not if I killed you.

28:30.210 --> 28:33.088
You know, they powered down
the gas chamber in here.

28:33.797 --> 28:34.965
Permanently.

28:36.341 --> 28:41.054
So a life sentence is just days
stacked on days.

28:42.848 --> 28:48.103
I could spend them thinking about
how you drained the life from me...

28:49.605 --> 28:52.107
and then how I drained it from you.

28:54.735 --> 28:55.819
Officer.

28:55.903 --> 28:59.823
If I am the thing
that you think that I am,

29:00.365 --> 29:05.954
then I have every right to kill you,
you piece-of-shit motherfucker.

29:07.664 --> 29:09.708
Because you know I'm innocent.

29:18.717 --> 29:19.760
Hey.

29:19.843 --> 29:21.845
Hey. Where you headed?

29:21.929 --> 29:23.138
New York.

29:23.222 --> 29:25.641
I got an address for Josie Buhrman.

29:25.724 --> 29:29.561
She goes by the name of Vivienne Parr, and
once I got that, it all started to click.

29:29.645 --> 29:31.813
-She used to live in England--
-How long you gone?

29:32.397 --> 29:34.107
Until I can get her to talk.

29:35.984 --> 29:37.277
You forgetting something?

29:38.779 --> 29:41.365
-Oh, shit. The dinner party.
-Yeah.

29:41.448 --> 29:45.327
"Shit. The dinner party." Tomorrow night.
I've got 15 people coming, Poppy.

29:45.410 --> 29:47.412
Including all the name partners.

29:47.496 --> 29:50.457
Babe, we just have to reschedule.

29:50.541 --> 29:52.042
No, I cannot reschedule.

29:52.125 --> 29:54.545
I'm just getting my footing at this firm,

29:54.628 --> 29:56.713
and you said
that you would be here for it.

29:56.797 --> 29:58.257
Babe, it's gonna be okay.

29:58.799 --> 30:02.219
Okay. You just--
They have things come up all the time.

30:02.302 --> 30:04.429
-You cannot--
-You have things come up all the time.

30:04.513 --> 30:07.808
You cannot put our lives on hold
to go chase a ghost.

30:07.891 --> 30:11.645
I... will text you when I land.

30:13.105 --> 30:14.356
Text you when I land.

30:17.401 --> 30:18.527
Don't be mad.

30:21.905 --> 30:22.906
Love you.

30:26.994 --> 30:32.708
Good investigators take advantage of the
fact that people are creatures of habit.

30:32.791 --> 30:37.337
That natural desire for routine, comfort,

30:37.921 --> 30:40.841
safety, for community.

30:42.342 --> 30:43.594
Where we eat...

30:45.262 --> 30:46.430
where we worship...

30:47.472 --> 30:49.725
where we take our children to play.

30:49.808 --> 30:51.810
Those things leave bread crumbs...

30:52.853 --> 30:54.938
clues about your life

30:55.647 --> 30:57.524
that allow people like me...

30:59.151 --> 31:00.235
to find you.

31:02.487 --> 31:04.781
Are you sleeping

31:04.865 --> 31:07.159
Are you sleeping

31:07.242 --> 31:09.494
Brother John?

31:09.578 --> 31:11.538
Brother John?

31:11.622 --> 31:16.001
Morning bells are ringing
Morning bells are ringing

31:16.084 --> 31:18.337
Ding, dong, ding

31:18.420 --> 31:20.923
Ding, dong, ding

31:21.548 --> 31:23.425
Her voice has gotten so much stronger.

31:23.509 --> 31:25.093
Well, she did all the work.

31:27.596 --> 31:29.765
Sorry, I'd really prefer cash.

31:29.848 --> 31:32.851
It's just easier
till everything's sorted out with my visa.

31:33.477 --> 31:35.771
Bit at the mercy
of the State Department till then.

31:37.856 --> 31:38.941
Good job.

31:43.278 --> 31:44.279
Oh, shit.

31:47.616 --> 31:48.617
Josie.

33:20.250 --> 33:21.251
Josie.

33:22.544 --> 33:26.215
See, it's a dating website
for incarcerated men.

33:26.298 --> 33:29.676
My sister put my picture up.
I already got ten letters.

33:30.260 --> 33:32.721
-Ten letters.
-Can she get all of us on that?

33:39.895 --> 33:41.813
Who's that black woman came to see you?

33:43.941 --> 33:47.027
Just... a reporter asking about my case.

33:48.445 --> 33:49.488
And that's it?

33:52.282 --> 33:53.367
That's it.

34:07.297 --> 34:10.300
Susan died en route to the hospital.

34:12.135 --> 34:13.469
I'm truly sorry.

34:18.475 --> 34:20.101
Thank you for telling me.

34:20.185 --> 34:22.437
I'm not here to cause problems for you.

34:22.521 --> 34:24.815
And I hate to bring you
such terrible news.

34:24.898 --> 34:27.359
But I'm trying to get
an innocent man out of prison.

34:29.444 --> 34:31.405
-He's not innocent.
-I think he is.

34:32.947 --> 34:36.076
And I think your sister lied about
seeing him jump the fence that night.

34:37.995 --> 34:41.248
Well, is there anything you can remember
from that night?

34:43.792 --> 34:47.337
This isn't a story to me, okay?

34:48.130 --> 34:50.799
This is my life. Was my life-- I...

34:52.342 --> 34:58.640
I have a family now, and you
are parachuting in to destroy that.

35:02.978 --> 35:04.104
It's your aunt's.

35:07.316 --> 35:10.527
I found it near the accident site
and kept it for you.

35:12.404 --> 35:15.324
Maybe we were all wrong.

35:16.283 --> 35:19.369
I have to get to the truth
of what happened that night.

35:19.453 --> 35:22.331
I have to know if he's innocent.

35:22.414 --> 35:23.624
I have to go.

35:46.104 --> 35:47.105
There he is.

35:47.898 --> 35:49.191
Hey, Markus.

35:49.608 --> 35:50.609
Armand.

35:50.692 --> 35:52.402
-Haven't seen you in a while.
-I know.

35:52.486 --> 35:53.487
Everything okay?

35:53.570 --> 35:54.571
Oh, yeah.

35:55.113 --> 35:57.074
Right as rain, brother. Right as rain.

35:57.157 --> 35:59.326
Five years without a drink and counting.

35:59.409 --> 36:00.410
How you doin'?

36:00.827 --> 36:02.079
Can't complain.

36:02.412 --> 36:03.580
I do anyway though.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.667
Hey, let me ask you something.

36:06.750 --> 36:08.377
How's that boss of yours over there?

36:08.460 --> 36:10.712
Chief Cave. He a hard-ass?

36:10.796 --> 36:11.880
Nah, he's one of us.

36:11.964 --> 36:15.384
Cop's cop. You thinking about
getting back behind the badge?

36:15.467 --> 36:16.552
Fuck no.

36:17.344 --> 36:21.056
A friend of mine, he put in an application
for the department.

36:21.557 --> 36:22.766
That's why I'm asking.

36:23.350 --> 36:26.436
Hey, Cave's old partner, he still around?

36:26.520 --> 36:27.896
He died two years ago.

36:27.980 --> 36:29.690
A week after he retired.

36:30.023 --> 36:31.859
-No shit.
-Good man.

36:31.942 --> 36:35.153
His wife still brings cupcakes
to the station every Fourth of July.

36:35.571 --> 36:37.197
Any idea where I can find her?

36:42.703 --> 36:46.373
...up and breathe.

36:55.382 --> 36:58.594
I hope you don't mind.
It helps with my plantar fasciitis.

36:58.677 --> 36:59.678
Do your thing.

37:00.137 --> 37:01.305
No, I'm good, thank you.

37:01.722 --> 37:04.433
My husband
never brought the job home with him.

37:05.517 --> 37:08.520
So he never told you any stories
about him and Owen Cave?

37:09.062 --> 37:11.106
Oh, George said he was a climber.

37:11.190 --> 37:12.316
Too ambitious.

37:12.816 --> 37:15.068
Gunning for chief from day one.

37:15.736 --> 37:18.655
Did he think Owen Cave was dirty?

37:18.739 --> 37:21.909
Oh, no. No. Not at all. Nothing like that.

37:21.992 --> 37:24.661
He was just so straight and narrow
he couldn't see sideways.

37:24.745 --> 37:28.165
Probably why he didn't see that business
with his wife coming.

37:28.957 --> 37:30.375
Who? Melanie?

37:30.834 --> 37:34.505
She was banging that dead guy
six ways from Sunday.

37:34.588 --> 37:35.839
Holy shit.

37:56.610 --> 37:57.528
Hey.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.322
-You good?
-I just came--

38:02.699 --> 38:04.034
You have something for me?

38:04.117 --> 38:08.121
Oh, yeah. Your girl Melanie Cave
was having an affair.

38:09.581 --> 38:10.749
With Chuck Buhrman.

38:11.166 --> 38:12.835
You lyin'.

38:12.918 --> 38:14.962
Nope. Went on for months.

38:15.045 --> 38:17.589
And you know what that means.
If Owen Cave found out...

38:17.965 --> 38:19.299
He had motive.

40:23.340 --> 40:25.342
Do you remember our ninth birthday?

40:27.469 --> 40:29.596
Aunt Susan got you the yellow bow.

40:33.100 --> 40:35.853
No, you had the yellow one.
I had the red one.

40:41.567 --> 40:43.527
Please come home.

40:45.779 --> 40:47.447
I miss you, Lanie.

40:51.785 --> 40:53.954
I love you so much that...

40:55.455 --> 40:58.500
it's hard to breathe without you.

41:02.629 --> 41:04.381
But I am never coming home.

41:05.591 --> 41:06.884
You terrify me.
