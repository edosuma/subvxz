14:10.467 --> 14:14.000
- # I see you standing #
- Hope you remembered the ring.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
# Right here by my side #

14:16.000 --> 14:18.500

"Supreme Court

- Come on. Which wire?
- I said no.

15:15.900 --> 15:18.367
I said no. I said no.

15:18.367 --> 15:21.833
I said no.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.900
What do you guys want from me?

15:23.900 --> 15:27.267
We're the Reality Police, Matt.

15:30.167 --> 15:34.433
We got ya now, punk.
You can't run.

15:43.300 --> 15:45.067
Whoa!

15:45.500 --> 15:48.967
- Who are you guys?
- What? You want our badge numbers?

15:51.300 --> 15:54.500
We told you, Matt.
We're the Reality Police.

No, I mean, what
do you want with me?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.967
Where am I?

16:00.467 --> 16:02.867
He wants to know where he is.

16:02.867 --> 16:04.900
- [ Laughing ]
- [ Laughing ]

16:05.300 --> 16:06.833
I'll tell you where you are.

16:25.367 --> 16:28.533
are charged with crimes against reality.

16:28.533 --> 16:30.533
How do you plead?

16:30.533 --> 16:34.400
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- Silence!

16:34.400 --> 16:36.433
How do you plead?

16:36.433 --> 16:38.867
Well, not guilty.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.967
I'll be the judge of that.

16:40.967 --> 16:43.300
But I didn't do anything.

16:43.300 --> 16:47.000
You weren't happy being
the youngest in your family.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.667
You didn't accept
the way things were.

16:49.667 --> 16:52.433
- But--
- Silence!

16:52.433 --> 16:54.967
Roll the videotape.

16:54.967 --> 16:59.600
Reality-- Who needs it?
I hate realty.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.700
Reality-- Who needs it?

17:01.700 --> 17:04.233
I hate reality.

17:04.233 --> 17:07.532
Is that you on that videotape?

17:07.933 --> 17:10.700
- Yes, but--
- Silence!

17:10.700 --> 17:13.267
You are hereby charged
with violation...

17:13.267 --> 17:15.300
of subsection "C,"
paragraph seven...

17:15.967 --> 17:18.166
of the Universal Penal Code--

17:18.166 --> 17:21.532
crimes against reality.

17:21.532 --> 17:24.067
I promise I won't do it again.

17:24.500 --> 17:27.633
- I-I like my reality.
- You should have thought of that before.

17:28.067 --> 17:30.967
No, please. I accept my reality.
It's not so bad.

17:30.967 --> 17:35.633
It's too late. Do you want
to hear the decision?

17:35.633 --> 17:38.467
- Yes. I mean, no.
- Silence!

17:38.467 --> 17:40.833
You are out of order.

17:41.267 --> 17:43.200
Sit down.

17:43.200 --> 17:46.667
For your crimes against reality,

17:46.667 --> 17:49.233

17:56.667 --> 17:58.500
- [ Gavel Raps ]

17:58.500 --> 18:01.167

- Guilty!

18:01.600 --> 18:05.267
Guilty! Guilty!
[ Laughing ]

18:06.000 --> 18:09.633
You are guilty!
Guilty, guilty, guilty!

18:10.967 --> 18:13.467
Guilty, guilty, guilty!

18:13.467 --> 18:15.700
[ Laughing ]
Guilty, guilty, guilty!

18:15.700 --> 18:18.733
Guilty.
[ Laughs ]

18:18.733 --> 18:20.800
Guilty!

18:22.367 --> 18:25.167
- Get him
- [ Mom ] Matt!

18:25.167 --> 18:28.700
- [ Panting ]
- Oh, there you are.

18:28.700 --> 18:31.833
- Mom.
- I thought I told you to stay out of there.

18:31.833 --> 18:34.400
Come on down right now.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.400
Huh? Huh?

18:39.400 --> 18:42.033
Have you been up there
the whole time I was gone?

18:42.033 --> 18:45.833
I fell asleep.
And I had the worst dream.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.800
- Oh, hi, Mom. Oh, it's just my mom.
- It was horrible.

18:48.800 --> 18:52.567
Everyone was trying to make me do
things that were way too hard for a kid.

18:52.567 --> 18:56.233
Didn't you even notice Matt was
up in the attic the whole time I was gone?

18:56.233 --> 18:59.233
- Uh, I guess not.
- [ Exhales ]

18:59.233 --> 19:01.500
I don't know.
My brother was up in the attic.

19:01.500 --> 19:04.467
And there were these men
chasing me-- these men in black.

19:04.900 --> 19:07.300
- There's this really cute guy--
- And then the reality judge sentenced me.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.700
Mom?
Are you listening to me?

19:09.700 --> 19:12.133
Yes, honey. I'm sorry.
You had a bad dream.

19:12.133 --> 19:14.933
Listen, Matt, I've been thinking.

19:14.933 --> 19:18.000
Maybe you are old enough to
move your room up into the attic.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.333
If that's what you really want to do,
it's okay with me.

19:23.333 --> 19:25.700
Gosh. I don't know.

19:25.700 --> 19:27.967
I thought that's what you wanted.

19:27.967 --> 19:30.967
Well, I did.
You know what?

19:30.967 --> 19:33.400
I think I'm gonna stay
out of the attic from now on.

19:33.400 --> 19:36.367
- Okay, if that's what you want.
- It is. And you know what?

19:36.367 --> 19:39.700
- What?
- Life is good just the way it is.

19:39.700 --> 19:43.767
And I think I'm gonna
go to bed in my own room now.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.867
Hold on a second.

19:47.867 --> 19:50.800
Didn't you leave
some things up there?

19:50.800 --> 19:53.000
I guess. Yeah.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.900
Well, bring 'em down
before you go to bed.

19:54.900 --> 19:56.767
I don't wanna go back up there.

19:56.767 --> 19:59.700
Hurry up.

20:02.700 --> 20:04.600
And as for you, young lady--

20:19.600 --> 20:21.967
[ Gasps ]

20:21.967 --> 20:24.467
It was just a dream, Matt.

20:24.467 --> 20:26.467
It was just a dream.

20:26.467 --> 20:29.100
Back to reality--

20:29.100 --> 20:32.533
just good old boring reality.

20:32.533 --> 20:34.767
[ Man ]
Boring?

20:35.267 --> 20:39.133
Oh, Matt, the fun's just beginning.

20:39.133 --> 20:41.667
[ Thunderclap ]
