WEBVTT

00:03.536 --> 00:06.105
We're finally seniors.

00:06.139 --> 00:07.139
This is so cool.

00:09.109 --> 00:11.110
Yay! Seniors! Whoop!

00:13.046 --> 00:15.180
And that's so not cool.

00:19.986 --> 00:22.888
Wow! Someone went all out for
the first day of school.

00:22.922 --> 00:25.224
I spent all last night
picking up this outfit.

00:25.258 --> 00:27.203
I wanted to make sure that
no one wore the same thing,

00:27.227 --> 00:29.895
because that would
be embarrassing.

00:30.997 --> 00:33.198
I guarantee no one's wearing...

00:33.233 --> 00:34.333
That.

00:39.139 --> 00:41.140
Pfft! Look at that doof.

00:41.174 --> 00:42.975
Must be a junior!

00:44.210 --> 00:46.879
Senior year is gonna be amazing.

00:46.913 --> 00:50.983
And the best part is I get to spend
it with my friends and my boyfriend.

00:51.017 --> 00:52.184
That's me.

00:53.253 --> 00:55.187
Aww! Look at you two.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.989
I used to have that
with somebody.

00:57.023 --> 00:58.123
Her name? Carrie.

00:58.158 --> 00:59.858
Her face? Pretty.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.226
Her I.Q.? Low.

01:03.096 --> 01:04.962
But I know how you feel, Dez.

01:04.998 --> 01:07.166
Ever since Jason and I
decided to take a break,

01:07.200 --> 01:09.134
I've been feeling kind of down.

01:09.169 --> 01:11.303
But things are looking up now.

01:11.337 --> 01:13.138
Hey!

01:13.173 --> 01:15.207
I like your shirt.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.276
Look like it's made of
boyfriend material.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.248
Hola, señora Gomez.

01:23.283 --> 01:24.316
How was your summer?

01:24.350 --> 01:27.286
Hola, Ally. My summer was great.

01:27.320 --> 01:31.890
I re-watched all 49 seasons of
my favorite Spanish soap opera:

01:32.959 --> 01:35.227
"Corazón caliente."

01:37.197 --> 01:38.997
Hola, señor Moon. ¿cómo estás?

01:39.032 --> 01:42.167
Thanks! I am having
a good hair day.

01:42.202 --> 01:44.002
She didn't compliment your hair.

01:44.037 --> 01:45.904
She asked how you are?

01:45.939 --> 01:47.906
And shouldn't you be
sitting somewhere else?

01:47.941 --> 01:49.908
That area is for seniors only.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.944
I know. We're all seniors.

01:51.978 --> 01:54.947
No, they are seniors.
You are not.

01:54.981 --> 01:58.317
Because of all your touring last year,
you never passed my Spanish class.

01:58.351 --> 02:00.953
Which makes you
one credit short.

02:00.987 --> 02:02.855
I'm afraid...

02:04.057 --> 02:06.859
You are still a junior.

02:08.995 --> 02:10.027
- What?
- No!

02:10.062 --> 02:11.964
- Seriously?
- Ay, ay, ay.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:06.853 --> 03:08.253
I'm bummed about Austin.

03:08.288 --> 03:10.856
We've really looking forward
to being seniors together.

03:10.890 --> 03:13.258
I know. I really feel
bad for the guy.

03:13.293 --> 03:15.227
- Hey, guys.
- Beat it, junior!

03:15.261 --> 03:18.830
Sorry, that's how seniors are
supposed to talk to juniors.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.165
Rules are rules.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.968
Well, I'm off to class.

03:23.002 --> 03:24.236
I'll miss you.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.275
I'm gonna miss you most of
all, you pathetic junior.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.311
It's the rules.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.882
Wait, Trish!

03:36.916 --> 03:38.156
So, I spoke with señora Gomez.

03:38.184 --> 03:40.886
She's letting me re-take
last year's final on Friday.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.955
If I'll pass, I'll be a senior.

03:42.989 --> 03:45.991
Nice! Just in time for the
senior carnival Friday night.

03:46.025 --> 03:47.226
I really need your help!

03:47.260 --> 03:48.994
Spanish is my worst subject.

03:49.028 --> 03:51.230
I'm so much gooder at English.

03:51.264 --> 03:52.931
Are ya?

03:52.966 --> 03:57.202
Since you speak Spanish so well, would
you help me study for the exam?

03:57.237 --> 03:59.838
- I don't know.
- I'll pay you.

03:59.872 --> 04:02.107
Guest who got a job as
your new Spanish tutor.

04:05.845 --> 04:08.213
Coach Simmons? What? You're
teaching advanced chemistry?

04:08.248 --> 04:12.017
And wrestling, glee club, drama
and interpretative dance.

04:12.051 --> 04:13.252
Budget cuts.

04:16.255 --> 04:19.057
Dez, how did you get
into advanced chemistry?

04:19.091 --> 04:21.192
I took a left at the cafeteria,
walked down the hall,

04:21.226 --> 04:22.928
and the door was wide open.

04:22.962 --> 04:24.930
Hey, coach.

04:24.964 --> 04:27.032
Not you again.

04:27.066 --> 04:29.234
Great lesson in interpretative
dance class today.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.910
All right, everyone!

04:38.945 --> 04:41.280
I'm coaching advanced
chemistry this year.

04:41.314 --> 04:43.949
We've got a tough season ahead,

04:43.983 --> 04:46.918
but if we practice hard
we can win this thing.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.954
Okay, chemistry on three.

04:48.988 --> 04:50.856
One, two, three...

04:50.890 --> 04:51.923
Chemistry!

04:51.958 --> 04:53.058
- Chemistry.
- Chemistry!

04:53.092 --> 04:55.227
We'll work on that.

04:55.261 --> 04:58.964
Next, I'll assign your lab
partners for the school year.

04:58.998 --> 05:01.133
I really hope I can get Sun Hee.

05:01.167 --> 05:04.236
Well, that is... if
I can't get you.

05:04.270 --> 05:07.272
I have to get an "A" in this
class, and she's really smart.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.941
Look, she's already started
reading the text book.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.049
Okay, Tim, your lab partner
is gonna be Jenny.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.151
Warren, you're gonna
be with Toby.

05:19.185 --> 05:21.253
And Dez, you're gonna
be partnered up with...

05:21.287 --> 05:22.287
Not me, not me, not me.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.124
Ally.

05:28.094 --> 05:30.195
Yay!

05:30.229 --> 05:32.264
Ha, you and me!

05:32.298 --> 05:34.166
Side by side!

05:34.200 --> 05:36.101
All year long...

05:36.135 --> 05:39.137
I'll express my excitement
through interpretative dance.

05:53.953 --> 05:57.222
Okay, so my plan is to fully
immerse you in Spanish,

05:57.256 --> 05:59.825
so you can speak it well
enough to pass that test.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.160
I labeled everything in this
room with its Spanish name.

06:02.195 --> 06:05.931
So, let's begin, señor Moon.

06:05.965 --> 06:09.000
- Okay, silla.
- Silla.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.903
- Puerta.
- Puerta.

06:13.072 --> 06:16.007
- Bicho raro.
- Bicho raro.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.276
That means "handsome gentleman."

06:21.214 --> 06:23.014
I lied. It means "weirdo."

06:24.117 --> 06:26.218
Now, let's move on to
some introductions.

06:26.252 --> 06:28.987
Hola, me llamo
señorita de la rosa.

06:29.021 --> 06:31.823
That means: "Hello, my
name is miss de la rosa."

06:31.858 --> 06:32.858
Now you try.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.993
Hello, my name is
miss de la rosa.

06:36.028 --> 06:39.064
No! Introduce
yourself in Spanish.

06:46.038 --> 06:47.939
Me llamo...

06:49.075 --> 06:50.208
Austin!

06:50.243 --> 06:52.144
Hey, I'm getting better already.

06:53.179 --> 06:57.082
So, how's my little
estudiante doing?

06:57.116 --> 06:58.283
Huh?

06:59.919 --> 07:01.319
I think that answers
your question.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.057
I'm worried. What if I
don't pass the test?

07:06.092 --> 07:09.961
Oh, I don't want to put any
pressure on you, Austin.

07:09.996 --> 07:14.900
But if you don't pass this test, you
wont be able to go to senior carnival,

07:14.934 --> 07:18.870
senior picture day, senior
prom, senior anything!

07:18.905 --> 07:22.240
And then I'll graduate and go to college,
and you'll still be in high school.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.853
I'll be doing college things and
you'll be doing high school things,

07:24.877 --> 07:27.045
and our entire lives
will be ruined!

07:27.079 --> 07:29.281
Okay. Good.

07:29.315 --> 07:31.883
So, no pressure.

07:37.607 --> 07:39.941
I make sure you use sulfate
we get and not magnesium.

07:39.976 --> 07:42.911
And it has to be measured
to the precise milligram.

07:42.945 --> 07:44.513
Ally, I know what I'm doing.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.307
I've got our scale right
here in my backpack.

07:49.986 --> 07:52.521
You melted your backpack?

07:52.555 --> 07:54.995
But our scale was in there. We
needed that for the assignment.

07:55.024 --> 07:57.959
Relax, this is chemistry!
It's supposed to be fun.

07:57.994 --> 07:59.728
It's not an exact science.

07:59.762 --> 08:01.696
That's exactly what it is!

08:01.731 --> 08:03.899
An exact science!

08:03.933 --> 08:07.569
And it's only fun when
you follow the rules,

08:07.603 --> 08:10.505
study the textbook, write the
lab reports, and get an "A."

08:10.540 --> 08:12.908
Ally, there's no "A" in "fun."

08:15.845 --> 08:17.546
See you tomorrow, coach!

08:17.580 --> 08:19.814
Oh, and great news: I transfered
into your drama class,

08:19.849 --> 08:22.851
so now you get to teach
me three times a day.

08:22.885 --> 08:26.555
Yippee! All my dreams are
finally coming true.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.656
Aww.

08:27.690 --> 08:29.491
This year's gonna
be so much fun.

08:29.525 --> 08:30.959
See you tomorrow... partner.

08:30.993 --> 08:34.496
Can't wait... partner.

08:35.965 --> 08:38.633
You got to give me a new partner!
Please, please!

08:38.668 --> 08:41.770
Whoa, whoa, Dawson!
I feel your pain.

08:41.804 --> 08:44.673
But you can't switch unless
you can convince someone else

08:44.707 --> 08:46.675
to take Dez as a lab partner.

08:46.709 --> 08:47.842
Good luck with that.

08:51.847 --> 08:55.617
Okay, here's my master
plan to get rid of Dez.

08:55.651 --> 08:58.920
All I have to do is Aaron's math homework.
And then he will switch

08:58.955 --> 09:00.855
with Brittney M. If I
babysit his pet weasel.

09:00.890 --> 09:03.658
Then Brittney M. will switch
with Pam if I wash her car.

09:03.693 --> 09:05.927
So that way she can be partners
with her boyfriend Tim.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.763
Leaving Tim's partner
to be stuck with Dez.

09:08.798 --> 09:12.834
And then I'll... get an "A."

09:12.868 --> 09:15.470
Whoo! Self-five!

09:16.639 --> 09:18.473
Hmm, bad news.

09:18.507 --> 09:19.851
Pam and Tim broke
up at lunch today.

09:19.875 --> 09:21.776
There's no way they'll
want to be partners now.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.812
What? But...

09:23.846 --> 09:26.615
I'm already babysitting
the weasel!

09:27.717 --> 09:29.784
Uh-oh. Willy? Willy!

09:29.819 --> 09:32.754
Come to mama. Come to mama.
Come to mama.

09:32.788 --> 09:34.889
Hola, señoritas. ¿cómo están?

09:36.859 --> 09:39.527
Austin, your Spanish
is getting better.

09:39.562 --> 09:41.663
Estoy bien, ¿y tú?

09:41.697 --> 09:44.666
Hola, señoritas. ¿cómo están?

09:44.700 --> 09:46.868
That's the only sentence
you know, isn't it?

09:46.902 --> 09:48.803
Yep. Pretty much.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.839
Didn't you study all those
flash cards I made you?

09:50.873 --> 09:52.741
I did, but that's
all I can remember!

09:52.775 --> 09:55.510
I told you, I'm
terrible at Spanish.

09:55.544 --> 09:56.711
We'll think of something.

09:56.746 --> 09:58.513
We just have to get
more creative.

09:59.607 --> 10:01.687
By the way, you guys want
to hear the weirdest thing?

10:01.717 --> 10:04.786
I just saw a weasel
at the food court!

10:04.820 --> 10:06.688
Willy!

10:10.993 --> 10:12.894
I don't see how this
is going to help.

10:20.736 --> 10:23.705
The mariachi will sing every
word you say, in Spanish.

10:23.739 --> 10:26.675
And since you're a musical person
and you never forget lyrics,

10:26.709 --> 10:28.977
I figure this, is the best
way for you to learn.

10:29.011 --> 10:30.945
And you really think
this will work?

10:39.989 --> 10:41.890
The exam is tomorrow,
so it better.

10:41.924 --> 10:43.858
Thanks, Trish, now
if you excuse me...

10:43.893 --> 10:45.593
I really got to
use the bathroom.

10:53.836 --> 10:55.670
I'm gonna go upstairs now.

10:57.606 --> 10:58.967
Yeah, yeah, going
to the bathroom.

11:02.712 --> 11:04.713
I can go by myself.
I'm a big boy.

11:07.983 --> 11:09.818
You stay here!

11:12.922 --> 11:14.556
Thanks, bye.

11:21.997 --> 11:26.668
So, after I found the weasel,
I washed brittney M.'s car.

11:26.702 --> 11:29.738
And I talked Tim into apologizing
to Pam so they get back together.

11:29.772 --> 11:33.575
And that's how I finally got
you as my new lab partner.

11:37.913 --> 11:39.814
I don't speak Korean, but...

11:39.849 --> 11:42.751
That doesn't sound like,
"yay, Ally, we're partners!"

11:42.785 --> 11:44.753
That's because she's
not your partner.

11:44.787 --> 11:48.022
Dez made a bunch of switches,
so, Ally, you're back with him.

11:48.057 --> 11:49.824
- What?
- What?

11:49.859 --> 11:51.903
But I spent all day doing
favors and trading with people,

11:51.927 --> 11:53.972
so that I didn't have to have
to be with Ally anymore.

11:53.996 --> 11:56.030
I clipped Aaron's toenails.

11:56.065 --> 11:59.667
Every switch you made undid
the switches she made.

11:59.702 --> 12:00.902
Ironic, ain't it?

12:02.538 --> 12:03.805
What? Hold on.

12:03.839 --> 12:07.776
It makes sense that I wouldn't want
to be your lab partner, but...

12:07.810 --> 12:09.878
How could you not want
to be my lab partner?

12:09.912 --> 12:12.814
You're too controlling! You
don't let me do anything!

12:12.848 --> 12:15.750
I need a lab partner
that's gonna let me be me.

12:15.785 --> 12:19.921
Well, I need a lab partner that's gonna
let me be the me that gets an "A."

12:19.955 --> 12:21.790
Not the me that gets a "B."

12:21.824 --> 12:22.891
Or a "C."

12:22.925 --> 12:24.926
Or a "D." Oh my gosh,
I'm feeling faint.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.761
Hmm.

12:26.796 --> 12:31.699
Maybe there is a way to take all these
"me"s and turn them into a "we."

12:31.734 --> 12:35.937
I think if we work together, we
can have fun and get an "A."

12:38.974 --> 12:40.675
Fine.

12:40.709 --> 12:42.744
If you try to take the
assignment more seriously,

12:42.778 --> 12:44.946
I will try to be
less controlling.

12:44.980 --> 12:48.650
Even though I'm not remotely
in any way controlling.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.585
Ask anybody.

12:50.619 --> 12:52.887
Raise your hand if you
think I'm controlling.

12:54.957 --> 12:55.990
Put your hand down.

13:01.697 --> 13:04.566
- Hey, Austin.
- Hey, Sergio. How is it going?

13:04.600 --> 13:05.934
It's going muy bien.

13:05.968 --> 13:08.736
Turns out, putting Spanish to music
really helps me memorize it.

13:12.608 --> 13:14.876
Sergio, para de cantar.
Toma un descanso.

13:16.846 --> 13:18.580
What? No way!

13:18.614 --> 13:20.915
You just told him to stop
singing and take a break.

13:20.950 --> 13:23.585
You're actually
speaking Spanish!

13:23.619 --> 13:24.919
Well, thanks to you and Sergio,

13:24.954 --> 13:26.874
I'm totally gonna ace that
test tomorrow morning.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.923
Great! I'll let you
get back to studying.

13:28.958 --> 13:30.758
- Adios.
- Huh?

13:32.561 --> 13:34.662
I'm kidding. Hasta mañana.

13:36.966 --> 13:38.700
Sergio, I hope you're not tired,

13:38.734 --> 13:40.774
'cause we have a long night
of studying ahead of us.

13:59.054 --> 14:00.722
Oh, no!

14:00.756 --> 14:01.923
Oh, no, I overslept!

14:01.957 --> 14:03.825
I missed the test!
I missed the test!

14:17.540 --> 14:18.640
So, how did the test go?

14:18.674 --> 14:20.354
Did you ace it like you
thought you would?

14:20.376 --> 14:22.477
I messed up. I really,
really messed up.

14:22.511 --> 14:25.213
Oh, I know what he's doing.

14:25.247 --> 14:27.325
He's pretending he failed the
test, so we'd get extra excited

14:27.349 --> 14:29.350
when he tells us that
he actually passed.

14:29.385 --> 14:31.286
Oh, congrats, buddy.

14:31.320 --> 14:32.453
No, you don't understand!

14:32.488 --> 14:34.255
I overslept and I
missed the test!

14:34.290 --> 14:35.623
Uh-huh, uh-huh, sure. Sure.

14:36.659 --> 14:39.460
I'm telling you, I didn't
make it to the test!

14:39.495 --> 14:41.696
Wow, you're really
committed to this bit!

14:41.730 --> 14:44.465
I don't think Austin's joking.

14:44.500 --> 14:48.269
Señora Gomez, I'm so sorry, I spent
all night studying Spanish...

14:48.304 --> 14:49.614
I do not want to
hear it, señor Moon.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.706
I gave you a second
chance and you blew it.

14:51.740 --> 14:53.575
I'm afraid that means...

14:54.643 --> 14:57.245
You are still junior.

15:00.482 --> 15:02.417
What is she looking at?

15:09.391 --> 15:12.193
I can't believe Austin isn't
going to be a senior with us.

15:12.227 --> 15:15.196
I know. It's like he's moving
backwards, we're moving forward.

15:15.230 --> 15:18.333
Next thing you know, I'm gonna be an
old man and he's gonna be a baby.

15:21.236 --> 15:22.670
That's not how it... never mind.

15:22.705 --> 15:24.572
Let's just finish our
chemistry assignment.

15:24.607 --> 15:26.441
Ah, good idea.

15:26.475 --> 15:29.395
Nothing like mixing dangerous chemicals
to get our mind off our heartache.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.548
- Ah... make sure that you...
- I know.

15:35.484 --> 15:37.452
- Now you really should...
- I know.

15:37.486 --> 15:39.687
- And you probably should...
- Ally, I've got it.

15:39.722 --> 15:42.457
You said you wouldn't
be so controlling.

15:42.491 --> 15:44.592
Okay, okay. I won't
say anything else.

15:48.497 --> 15:52.266
Hmm.

15:53.402 --> 15:56.371
Hmm, hmm.

15:56.405 --> 15:58.539
Hmm, I wish this mix
was a little prettier.

15:58.574 --> 16:00.375
Had like a nice shade of purple.

16:00.409 --> 16:02.510
- Ah, like this!
- Dez.

16:02.544 --> 16:05.647
You can't just add random chemicals
to make it look prettier.

16:05.681 --> 16:08.316
You promised to be
more responsible.

16:08.350 --> 16:10.585
But... I like purple.

16:12.488 --> 16:13.621
We all do.

16:13.656 --> 16:15.356
Fine.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.225
Oh, in that case, I
guess we're done.

16:17.259 --> 16:19.227
And nothing went wrong!

16:19.261 --> 16:21.362
Dez, your hand is frozen.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.231
Huh.

16:23.265 --> 16:24.365
I guess it is.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.533
Whoo! Chemistry!

16:32.408 --> 16:35.276
Okay, you get three chances to
knock down the milk bottles.

16:35.310 --> 16:36.511
Let me set them up for you.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.555
Dez, you gotta wait for
me to set them up.

16:43.585 --> 16:45.319
Sorry, coach.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.525
- Dez!
- Sorry, coach.

16:52.561 --> 16:53.695
There. Go ahead.

16:59.268 --> 17:02.236
- Dez, the milk bottles!
- Ah.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.505
Sorry, coach.

17:06.241 --> 17:07.541
Can you keep an eye on Dez?

17:07.576 --> 17:09.176
I need to sneak
back into the lab

17:09.211 --> 17:11.244
and mix our project in with
the hydrogen phosphate.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.247
I'm positive Dez
forgot to do it.

17:13.281 --> 17:16.349
Oh, no. Not the
hydrogen phosphate!

17:16.385 --> 17:18.653
Just kidding. I have no idea
what are you talking about.

17:21.323 --> 17:23.590
I'm gonna stand over
here where it's safe.

17:32.434 --> 17:34.268
What is wrong with you?

17:42.478 --> 17:45.346
Ooh, hydrogen phosphate.

17:55.524 --> 17:58.526
And Ally saves the day again.
Ha!

18:19.248 --> 18:21.549
Ooh, purple!

18:21.583 --> 18:24.385
And Dez saves the day again!

18:41.436 --> 18:42.703
About time you got here!

18:42.738 --> 18:45.339
Señora Gomez is over there
working the cotton candy stand.

18:49.511 --> 18:52.632
Señor Moon, unless you're here for cotton
candy, we have nothing to talk about.

18:52.648 --> 18:55.483
I'm not here to talk.
I'm here to sing.

18:55.517 --> 18:57.385
Hit it, Sergio.

19:49.271 --> 19:52.406
That was quite
impressive, señor Moon.

19:52.441 --> 19:56.210
You have demonstrated a strong
comprehension of the Spanish language.

19:56.245 --> 19:58.212
So you'll let me take the test?

19:58.247 --> 20:00.448
No.

20:00.482 --> 20:02.450
It means you have
passed my class.

20:02.484 --> 20:04.518
Congratulations.

20:04.553 --> 20:06.220
You're now...

20:07.289 --> 20:09.223
A senior, señor.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.394
- Whoo!
- Yes!

20:13.428 --> 20:16.697
- Yay, Austin!
- What is she looking at?

20:16.732 --> 20:18.599
Can I have my money now?

20:18.634 --> 20:21.602
- Whoo!
- Wait a minute.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.404
Why are you wearing a lab coat?

20:23.438 --> 20:24.572
Oh, betrayal!

20:24.606 --> 20:26.474
You were working on the
experiment without me.

20:26.508 --> 20:28.276
Okay, fine!

20:28.310 --> 20:31.545
I know you forgot to combine our
mixture with the hydrogen phosphate,

20:31.580 --> 20:34.548
so I went back and
I did it myself.

20:34.583 --> 20:37.485
Wait a minute! You added
more hydrogen phosphate?

20:37.519 --> 20:39.587
But I just added a bunch
of that purple stuff.

20:39.621 --> 20:40.942
Do you know what
that's gonna do?

20:41.723 --> 20:43.457
Because I don't. Can
you explain it to me?

20:44.726 --> 20:47.595
Well, there is this tiny chance
that when they mix together

20:47.629 --> 20:50.665
it will bubble over, there will
be a huge explosion and...

20:55.704 --> 20:57.571
And gas will leak everywhere.

20:57.606 --> 21:00.574
Why did you put in the purple stuff?
Why? Why?

21:00.609 --> 21:02.443
I'm sorry. I like purple.

21:03.712 --> 21:05.579
Don't worry, don't
worry, don't worry.

21:05.614 --> 21:07.581
The gas isn't dangerous.
If anything...

21:07.616 --> 21:10.217
It'll just make your voice
squeaky for a little while.

21:10.252 --> 21:11.692
Why is it doing that?

21:11.720 --> 21:13.665
Because the air density is different
than the air we normally breathe,

21:13.689 --> 21:14.689
so that when we...

21:14.723 --> 21:15.723
Never mind.

21:15.757 --> 21:17.491
None of this would have happened

21:17.526 --> 21:18.726
if you weren't so controlling.

21:18.727 --> 21:20.561
Guys, who cares? I'm a senior!

21:26.702 --> 21:28.636
Arriba!

21:32.341 --> 21:34.308
- Gracias.
- De nada.

21:34.343 --> 21:36.477
Oh, I'm so excited, guys!

21:36.511 --> 21:38.713
Now that I'm a senior,
we can all finally relax

21:38.747 --> 21:40.581
and enjoy this carnival.

21:40.615 --> 21:42.416
- One...
- One...

21:43.685 --> 21:45.653
Okay, forget the push-ups.

21:45.687 --> 21:47.388
Just go clean up the lab.

21:52.294 --> 21:54.362
Trish, thanks so much
for all your help.

21:54.396 --> 21:55.707
I couldn't have done
it without you.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.499
And I know I said I'd pay
you if I passed, so...

21:58.533 --> 22:00.368
Here.

22:00.402 --> 22:02.503
Thanks, Austin. But honestly...

22:02.537 --> 22:04.405
I would have done this for free.

22:04.439 --> 22:05.573
- Really?
- No.

22:07.509 --> 22:09.343
Gracias, señorita.

22:13.348 --> 22:16.317
Oh, I forgot I had
to pay that guy!

22:16.351 --> 22:17.685
Dez, don't!

22:22.424 --> 22:24.525
Not again!

22:24.559 --> 22:26.427
But I like purple.
