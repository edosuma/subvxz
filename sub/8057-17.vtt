WEBVTT

00:01.634 --> 00:03.977
I'm looking for
Ronald Ulysses Swanson?

00:05.171 --> 00:07.515
He stepped out.
Can I take a message?

00:07.574 --> 00:08.575
Sure.

00:08.641 --> 00:11.087
Tell him hejust won a free dinner from St.
Elmo Steak House.

00:11.144 --> 00:12.987
(LAUGHS)

00:13.046 --> 00:15.185
I'm Ron Swanson.

00:15.248 --> 00:17.159
You've been served.
Have a nice day.

00:18.051 --> 00:21.464
I don't like you.
But I respect the effort.

00:21.521 --> 00:23.592
Oh, man. Subpoena?
Which ex-wife is it?

00:23.656 --> 00:24.896
Tammy One or Tammy Two?

00:24.958 --> 00:26.301
Neither.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.032
Apparently,
Councilman Jeremy Jamm

00:28.094 --> 00:29.539
is not pleased
that I punched him

00:29.596 --> 00:32.941
in the face on the night of Leslie's wedding.
He is suing me.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.980
$13,000 for orthodontic surgery.
$6,000 for enamel repair.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.848
And $46 million
for psychological damages.

00:40.907 --> 00:42.944
Oh, God. That seems
about accurate.

00:43.009 --> 00:44.955
That guy is the worst.

00:45.011 --> 00:48.515
We should sue Jamm's parents for
spawning a human turd-burger.

00:48.615 --> 00:50.288
Ron. Hey.
Let me be your lawyer.

00:50.350 --> 00:53.058
I'll object to everything anyone
says, trial will go on forever,

00:53.119 --> 00:55.463
you don't have to pay,
problem solved.

00:55.522 --> 00:58.594
That's a kind offer, Andrew, but
I won't be hiring an attorney.

00:58.658 --> 01:00.103
I'll represent myself,

01:00.160 --> 01:03.664
as I do in all legal matters
and livestock auctions.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.710
APRIL: I wish we had
$46 million.

01:05.765 --> 01:07.676
We could buy my parents'
house and evict them.

01:07.734 --> 01:08.940
I'm surprised
he's taking it this well.

01:09.002 --> 01:10.276
(RON SCREAMS)

01:10.336 --> 01:11.474
(LOUD THUD)

01:12.906 --> 01:15.409
April, could you call
maintenance, please?

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:38.298 --> 01:41.768
LESLIE: Okay. Move a little bit to your left.
And then, turn to the side.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.940
Okay, and freeze.
(LAUGHS)

01:44.003 --> 01:46.244
That is the exact spot.

01:46.306 --> 01:48.013
Where an 18-year-old
Ben Wyatt

01:48.074 --> 01:50.384
was inaugurated as Mayor
of Partridge, Minnesota.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.889
Oh, well, thank you very much.
Yes, congratulations to you.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.391
I don't know.
I have chills.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.723
I can't believe they're finally
giving me the key to the city.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.421
I can't believe
it took so long.

01:58.485 --> 02:00.123
They gave the key
to every other mayor

02:00.186 --> 02:02.291
in the town's history,
and I guarantee,

02:02.355 --> 02:03.925
that none of them had
as cute a butt as you do.

02:03.990 --> 02:07.597
And none of them caused the city's
unemployment rate to hit 30%.

02:07.660 --> 02:10.106
You're so sexy when you
talk about percentages.

02:10.163 --> 02:11.699
When Ben
was mayor he sunk

02:11.764 --> 02:14.370
all of the town's money
into a winter sports complex

02:14.434 --> 02:16.937
called Ice Town
and they went bankrupt.

02:17.003 --> 02:20.177
<i>Now, they've invited him back
as a gesture of goodwill,</i>

02:20.240 --> 02:21.548
<i>and he'll finally
get some closure</i>

02:21.608 --> 02:23.554
<i>on this miserable
chapter in his life.</i>

02:24.511 --> 02:26.218
Yay, Ben! Town hero!

02:26.279 --> 02:27.314
Yes!

02:27.380 --> 02:28.552
<i>Whoa!</i>

02:31.351 --> 02:34.992
Well, if it isn't the
defendant, Ron Swan-suck.

02:35.054 --> 02:37.091
(JAMM LAUGHS) 
TOM: Why are you doing this, Jamm?

02:37.157 --> 02:39.364
This lawsuit is Chronicles
of Riddick-ulous.

02:39.425 --> 02:41.098
I'll tell you why. It's because
I'm sick of this whole

02:41.161 --> 02:43.471
Parks and Rec gang.
That's why.

02:43.530 --> 02:46.101
This munch throws me
into a swimming pool.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.976
The nurse still won't have sex
with me, and she's not even queer.

02:49.035 --> 02:51.447
Now Swan-suck
punches me in the mouth.

02:51.504 --> 02:55.350
It's what we in the Jamm
family call payback time.

02:55.408 --> 02:56.478
Everyone calls it that.

02:56.543 --> 02:58.181
Yeah.
Because I invented it.

02:58.244 --> 03:00.918
Yeah. You're not going to
win $50 million, you freak.

03:00.980 --> 03:05.861
Maybe not. But I'm not not
going to win nothing.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.523
Paul?
(PAUL CLEARS THROAT)

03:08.521 --> 03:11.502
That guy is a joke. This lawsuit
is definitely getting thrown out.

03:11.558 --> 03:13.629
I don't know. Those are
Jean-Ralphio's lawyers.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.765
They once got him $60,000 because he
got too scared at a haunted house.

03:17.430 --> 03:18.534
(sums)

03:20.266 --> 03:22.371
Okay. Are you done?
Are we done? Did we win?

03:22.435 --> 03:23.846
You can't win this.

03:23.970 --> 03:25.415
You can win
at anything.

03:25.471 --> 03:27.508
Last year, I won an organic
gardening contest.

03:27.574 --> 03:28.678
Who were you
competing against?

03:28.808 --> 03:29.912
My own taste buds.

03:30.543 --> 03:34.150
I want to have a baby and Chris
has agreed to be the father.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.716
My fertility
counselor showed me

03:35.782 --> 03:37.193
this online quiz
that determines

03:37.250 --> 03:39.127
<i>whether we'd be
compatible parents.</i>

03:39.185 --> 03:41.358
If this were the '80s,
all we'd have to do is,

03:41.487 --> 03:43.694
not drop an egg
for a whole day.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.702
Stupid Internet.

03:45.758 --> 03:50.434
Okay. Our official
co-parenting score is

03:50.496 --> 03:54.273
58% compatibility.
Not amazing.

03:54.334 --> 03:55.677
Oh, I think
it's fantastic.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.772
I think it's literally the best
score we could have hoped for.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.343
Not sure
that that's true.

03:59.405 --> 04:00.509
DONNA: Oh, snap.

04:00.573 --> 04:04.385
I just filled it out for fun.
Chris and I are 81% compatible.

04:05.545 --> 04:07.024
You want to make a baby,
Traeger?

04:07.080 --> 04:11.620
Your hair, my everything else. That
kid will be unstoppable. (LAUGHS)

04:11.684 --> 04:13.823
Guys, I couldn't resist.
I did it, too.

04:13.886 --> 04:16.298
Ann and I got 84%.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.327
Well, this sucks.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.529
Yes. We did not win.

04:22.362 --> 04:24.808
So, was Ben
a bossy older brother?

04:24.897 --> 04:27.173
Did he make you
watch Star Wars movies?

04:27.233 --> 04:28.473
Make me?

04:28.534 --> 04:30.070
I loved those movies
just as much as he did.

04:30.203 --> 04:31.773
That's so cute.

04:32.739 --> 04:35.049
Huh.You do a lot of hugging.
Yeah.

04:35.108 --> 04:38.351
Get used to it. We're sisters now.
(LAUGHS)

04:38.411 --> 04:40.357
STEPHANIE: Benji, I'm really
glad you came back for this.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.222
A lot of jerks around here
didn't think you'd show up.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.660
Well, I wasn't sure. But
Leslie gave me the extra push,

04:44.717 --> 04:46.390
and I figured it
would be nice to put

04:46.452 --> 04:49.023
the Ice Town thing behind
me once and for all.

04:49.088 --> 04:52.467
Now that you're both here, let's get started.
Just have a few questions.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.073
You have a binder?
That's right.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.540
Who were Ben's high
school girlfriends

04:57.597 --> 04:59.577
and what base
do you think he got to?

04:59.632 --> 05:01.168
STEPHANIE: Um...
What's that?

05:02.001 --> 05:04.003
And what exactly
did you witness?

05:04.070 --> 05:10.043
Defendant, alias Ron Swanson, alias
my boss, used appropriate force

05:10.109 --> 05:12.282
to prevent further
damage to the wedding

05:12.345 --> 05:15.189
of Leslie Knope,
alias my other boss.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.421
You sound as if you have a special
interest in law enforcement.

05:17.483 --> 05:18.484
Yes, sir.

05:18.551 --> 05:21.191
In fact, at the time, I was trying
to become a police officer,

05:21.254 --> 05:22.392
but was deemed
unfit for the force.

05:22.455 --> 05:23.525
And what happened?

05:23.589 --> 05:26.695
Don't know. Well,
I pooched the brain exam.

05:26.759 --> 05:30.229
Just to be safe, I wouldn't take
anything I say too seriously.

05:31.731 --> 05:33.108
Next witness,
Your Honor.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.578
Ms. Ludgate, have you
ever heard Mr. Swanson

05:35.635 --> 05:37.672
threaten to hurt
Councilman Jamm?

05:37.804 --> 05:39.841
Ronny?
Are you kidding me?

05:39.906 --> 05:42.648
I have never heard him threaten
to hurt anyone or anything.

05:42.709 --> 05:45.519
The guy's,
like, a vegetarian.

05:45.578 --> 05:48.650
Look at him. He's like a
big old soft teddy bear.

05:48.715 --> 05:53.289
His nickname around the office
is Softy-Pants McHuggable.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.696
Did you ever hear
Mr. Swanson say

05:54.754 --> 05:56.791
he intended to injure
Councilman Jamm

05:56.856 --> 05:58.358
before the day
of the wedding?

05:58.424 --> 06:00.734
The answer is a flat no.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.331
Ron doesn't really pay much
attention to other people.

06:03.396 --> 06:05.000
I doubt he even
knew you existed.

06:05.064 --> 06:07.977
Also, may I state for the record,
that is a dope pocket square.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.274
Can I see that bad boy?

06:09.335 --> 06:13.306
Tom and April were excellent
witnesses in my defense.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.650
Unfortunately, every single word
out of their mouths was a lie.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.155
There's only one thing
I hate more than lying.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.486
Skim milk.

06:20.546 --> 06:23.857
Which is water that's
lying about being milk.

06:25.451 --> 06:27.988
Despite everything
that happened 20 years ago,

06:28.054 --> 06:29.897
this will always
be my hometown.

06:30.423 --> 06:31.458
(SOBS)

06:31.524 --> 06:33.504
Are you crying again?

06:33.559 --> 06:35.004
It's just, every time
you say that speech,

06:35.128 --> 06:36.573
I think about
where you've been

06:36.629 --> 06:40.577
and where you're going and our
future children, and America,

06:40.633 --> 06:42.374
and just our history
as a nation.

06:42.435 --> 06:45.473
Wow. I didn't think about all
that, but I thought it was good.

06:45.538 --> 06:46.539
Thanks, Steph.

06:46.606 --> 06:49.985
(SIGHS) I'm feeling sweaty.
Do I look sweaty?

06:50.042 --> 06:52.352
You know, I need to use
the bathroom one more time.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.153
That's, like,
five times in an hour.

06:54.213 --> 06:56.215
Well, somebody's nervous
about the ceremony.

06:56.282 --> 06:58.353
I don't blame him. He didn't
exactly leave Partridge

06:58.418 --> 07:01.058
as the most popular guy in town.
(BEN GROANS)

07:01.120 --> 07:02.190
Ben?

07:02.889 --> 07:04.300
Oh, my God.
(GROANS)

07:05.758 --> 07:07.362
Are you okay?

07:08.060 --> 07:09.869
I think I'm giving birth.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.431
Is that possible?
No, right?

07:11.497 --> 07:12.976
No. No, no, no, no.

07:13.032 --> 07:14.568
Oh, God.
I'll call an ambulance.

07:14.634 --> 07:17.911
No! God, it's twins.
I'm having twins.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.810
A kidney stone?

07:22.942 --> 07:24.512
Yep. Big sucker, too.

07:24.577 --> 07:26.579
We're going to have to keep
him here until it passes.

07:26.646 --> 07:30.389
Leslie and Dr. Clipperton?

07:30.450 --> 07:32.088
Wow, man.

07:32.151 --> 07:34.097
I'm so glad
you guys are meeting.

07:34.153 --> 07:37.760
It's like worlds collide,
you know? I love it.

07:37.824 --> 07:39.667
I want candy.

07:39.725 --> 07:40.795
What is he on?

07:40.860 --> 07:42.635
Morphine.
It's good stuff.

07:42.695 --> 07:43.696
Leslie, come here.

07:43.763 --> 07:46.175
Do you have any idea
how beautiful you are?

07:46.232 --> 07:48.940
I'm serious.
You're like a flower.

07:49.001 --> 07:54.917
Like a snug-bug. Or like a snuggerdoodle.
Or something like that.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.545
We should just go
for it, you know?

07:57.610 --> 07:58.953
Life.

07:59.011 --> 08:02.322
We have a ceremony we need
to be at in two hours.

08:02.381 --> 08:03.917
Is there anything
that we can do?

08:03.983 --> 08:06.520
Sorry, Ice Town. You're not going
anywhere for at least a day.

08:07.386 --> 08:08.922
Okay. Well,
I'll call Mayor Stice

08:09.121 --> 08:10.623
and we'll reschedule
the ceremony.

08:10.690 --> 08:13.000
No. This town
expects me to wuss out.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.800
I'm making that speech,
and I'm simply

08:14.861 --> 08:16.534
going to explain
to the crowd

08:16.596 --> 08:19.236
that love is everywhere
and they have to surrender

08:19.298 --> 08:21.073
to the flow
of the universe.

08:21.133 --> 08:23.613
Price is Right
is on, I think.

08:23.669 --> 08:28.140
Oh, I remember staying
home sick from school

08:28.207 --> 08:32.519
(SOBS) and watching The Price <i>Is</i> Right.
Oh, God.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.087
CHRIS: Look, I know that
this is just a silly quiz,

08:36.148 --> 08:38.525
but it is so discouraging
to do so poorly.

08:38.583 --> 08:41.861
Well, look. This is not the only way
to see if we would be good parents.

08:41.921 --> 08:43.298
I know it's a little lame,

08:43.356 --> 08:45.461
but I bought a dozen eggs
at the grocery store.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.663
And I thought
we could do that thing

08:46.726 --> 08:48.637
where we pretend
the egg is a kid for a day.

08:48.694 --> 08:49.695
That's a great idea.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.310
I don't see them.
Oh, my God.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.777
I left them
at the grocery store.

08:54.834 --> 08:56.006
Oh, boy.

08:56.068 --> 08:58.275
I bought 12 babies, and then
I immediately abandoned them

08:58.337 --> 08:59.839
at a Kroger's.

08:59.906 --> 09:02.682
Look. We can use anything as a baby.
I mean, we can use this mug.

09:10.316 --> 09:11.818
TOM: I don't understand.
I was great.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.727
I was like Mark Z
in The <i>Social</i> N.

09:13.786 --> 09:15.288
My testimonial
was amazing for your case.

09:15.421 --> 09:16.957
But it wasn't the truth.

09:17.023 --> 09:21.267
And neither was yours. You
even called me a vegetarian.

09:21.327 --> 09:24.308
What if that testimony leaks? How
will people ever respect me?

09:24.363 --> 09:27.173
(SCOFFS) Whatever.
The truth is stupid.

09:27.233 --> 09:30.146
I only tell the truth when it
makes me sound like I'm lying.

09:30.202 --> 09:32.011
TOM: Yeah,
lying is all I know.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.449
It's how I was able to scrape
by on the streets of Bombay

09:34.507 --> 09:36.783
<i>and make it on the Indian version
of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</i>

09:36.842 --> 09:39.584
and get reunited with the
love of my life. Latika.

09:39.645 --> 09:41.716
You could both take
a lesson from Andrew.

09:41.781 --> 09:44.125
He told the truth about
everything he was asked,

09:44.183 --> 09:46.026
even when it was
humiliating for him.

09:46.185 --> 09:47.459
That's right.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.761
I love telling the truth.
Case in point.

09:49.822 --> 09:51.529
Sometimes, when I blow
my nose, I get a boner.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.662
I don't know why.
It just happens.

09:53.726 --> 09:55.137
Truth bomb.

09:55.194 --> 09:56.901
I'm going to call you
both back in that room,

09:56.996 --> 09:58.475
and you'll recant
your testimony.

09:58.531 --> 09:59.703
No.
No.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.006
You committed perjury.
But more importantly,

10:02.068 --> 10:03.706
you've dishonored yourselves.

10:03.836 --> 10:05.474
(SIGHS) Oh, brother.

10:07.073 --> 10:12.489
(SIGHS) They are so young.
So much to learn.

10:12.545 --> 10:13.649
What are you
talking about?

10:13.713 --> 10:15.624
I know, right?
(CHUCKLES)

10:16.215 --> 10:17.421
Wisdom.

10:17.883 --> 10:18.953
STICE: Sick?

10:19.018 --> 10:20.588
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

10:20.720 --> 10:22.324
What has he got,
acute wimping out?

10:22.388 --> 10:24.334
No, he has kidney stones.
We have proof.

10:24.390 --> 10:28.998
Yeah, I took a video of him
at the hospital an hour ago.

10:29.061 --> 10:31.905
<i>I feel like I never gave
Miles Davis proper shrift.</i>

10:31.964 --> 10:33.910
<i>Like, I just
didn't get into it.</i>

10:33.966 --> 10:36.970
But the good news is, lam here
to accept the key on his behalf.

10:37.837 --> 10:39.817
Boy, it's just a real
shame it had to happen

10:39.872 --> 10:42.512
today of all days.
Damn it.

10:42.575 --> 10:43.815
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

10:43.876 --> 10:44.877
Excuse me.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.980
Hi. Everything okay? You want me
to come back to the hospital?

10:48.047 --> 10:50.789
No, I'm goodie goodie.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.887
You just do your thing,
baby smurf.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.464
<i>I mean,
I</i> wish you were here.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.431
It seems pretty
fun and festive.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.559
<i>The town mascot is here.</i>

10:57.623 --> 10:58.658
Fred the Sled?

10:59.225 --> 11:01.705
<i>They only bring him out
for special occasions.</i>

11:02.294 --> 11:07.004
I can't believe they're doing all this for me.
The universe is love.

11:07.066 --> 11:08.739
<i>Okay, stay away
from sharp things.</i>

11:09.702 --> 11:11.704
Well, well, well. Heard
you want to recant

11:11.804 --> 11:13.112
your earlier
statements.

11:13.172 --> 11:16.244
Yes. I misremembered
some things.

11:16.308 --> 11:18.948
I did, in fact,
hear Ron Swanson say

11:19.011 --> 11:21.116
he intended
to injure Jeremy Jamm.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.057
Boom! Knew it.

11:23.115 --> 11:24.150
JAMM: Tell us
about it, please.

11:24.283 --> 11:25.318
(SIGHS) Which time?

11:25.384 --> 11:26.920
Well, how many
were there?

11:27.586 --> 11:28.826
Well...

11:29.221 --> 11:31.997
Yeah, we did a trade.
I gave his wife new enamels.

11:32.558 --> 11:34.834
He gave my wife new yabbos.
(LAUGHS)

11:34.894 --> 11:36.464
Who's that gentleman?

11:36.529 --> 11:38.873
Jeremy Jamm. City Councilman.
You don't know him?

11:38.931 --> 11:40.706
Never met him. He looks
like he could use

11:40.833 --> 11:42.608
a swift punch
in the face though.

11:42.802 --> 11:44.213
(LAUGHS)

11:44.270 --> 11:45.442
And then,
before he can say anything,

11:45.504 --> 11:47.575
I just run over
and shove him into the pool.

11:47.640 --> 11:48.675
Bully for you.

11:48.741 --> 11:51.085
If it were me, I would have
just punched him in the face.

11:53.345 --> 11:54.847
What's up, Ron?

11:54.914 --> 11:57.952
Just daydreaming about
punching Jamm in the face.

11:58.017 --> 11:59.462
And there were
a few other times, too.

11:59.585 --> 12:01.064
We get the picture, son.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.897
Hold on. We need your full,
truthful testimony on record.

12:04.957 --> 12:06.630
Keep going, Tom.

12:08.227 --> 12:12.835
<i>But now, 20 years later,
the city has finally healed</i>

12:12.898 --> 12:15.879
<i>from the festering
wound of Ice Town.</i>

12:15.935 --> 12:20.281
<i>Today, we put those horribly
painful memories behind us</i>

12:20.339 --> 12:25.721
<i>as we welcome back the mayor

12:25.778 --> 12:27.280
<i>Ben Wyatt.</i>

12:27.646 --> 12:28.681
(ALL LAUGHING)

12:28.748 --> 12:32.161
That's a typo. That's a major typo.
That says "Ice Clown".

12:33.119 --> 12:34.826
And I'm just realizing
now that's not a typo.

12:34.887 --> 12:37.265
Hey, aren't you
his sister?

12:37.323 --> 12:39.769
I've got to get out of here.
Good luck, Leslie.

12:39.825 --> 12:42.965
<i>Here to accept the key

12:43.028 --> 12:46.032
<i>because Mr. Wyatt

<i>is his wife, Leslie Knope.</i>

12:48.868 --> 12:51.576
(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

12:51.637 --> 12:53.310
And it's water.

12:53.372 --> 12:54.407
(ALL LAUGHING)

12:54.473 --> 12:57.852
<i>Uh, oh.
The key was made of ice.</i>

12:57.910 --> 12:59.981
<i>And much like
the hopes and dreams</i>

13:00.045 --> 13:02.787
<i>of the people of Partridge,
it melted away.</i>

13:03.949 --> 13:06.862
Again, this would all be way
more satisfying if Ben was here.

13:06.919 --> 13:08.398
Okay, excuse me.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.297
<i>I would like to point
out that we drove</i>

13:10.422 --> 13:12.299
<i>all the way here
from Pawnee, Indiana.</i>

13:12.358 --> 13:14.463
<i>A city with some class,
by the way.</i>

13:15.294 --> 13:19.470
<i>And sure, my husband made an
honest mistake 20 years ago.</i>

13:19.565 --> 13:20.737
<i>But it was very meaningful
that you were...</i>

13:20.800 --> 13:21.835
Hi, Leslie.

13:21.901 --> 13:22.902
<i>...going to finally
be able to forgive him.</i>

13:22.968 --> 13:25.141
<i>If it's so meaningful to him,
then where is he?</i>

13:25.204 --> 13:26.706
<i>He is in
the hospital, sir.</i>

13:26.772 --> 13:29.548
<i>He has a calcified rock
lodged in his penis.</i>

13:29.608 --> 13:30.678
(CHUCKLES)

13:30.743 --> 13:32.051
<i>Frankly, Ben Wyatt
is the best thing</i>

13:32.178 --> 13:33.521
<i>to ever come out
of this crap town.</i>

13:33.579 --> 13:35.616
Oh, yeah?
What about Judy Garland?

13:36.148 --> 13:37.456
<i>Judy Garlands
from Partridge?</i>

13:37.516 --> 13:39.587
She lived here for a while.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.756
And Lee Janzen.

13:40.886 --> 13:41.990
<i>Who's Lee Janzen?</i>

13:42.054 --> 13:43.795
He's a golfer.
He's pretty good.

13:43.889 --> 13:45.800
<i>Well, Ben Wyatt
is better than Lee Janzen.</i>

13:45.858 --> 13:47.098
<i>And he's better
than Judy Garland.</i>

13:47.693 --> 13:49.695
<i>No, that's crazy.
Judy Garland is amazing.</i>

13:49.762 --> 13:51.969
<i>But Ben Wyatt
is better than all of you.</i>

13:52.031 --> 13:54.637
<i>Because he cared about this
town and he tried to help it.</i>

13:54.700 --> 13:57.943
<i>You know what? Screw you, Partridge.
</i> (ALL BOOING)

13:58.003 --> 14:01.348
And a sled
is a stupid mascot!

14:03.809 --> 14:05.345
Thank you, Ms. Ludgate.

14:05.411 --> 14:08.949
It is now quite clear that on
innumerable occasions, Ron Swanson

14:09.014 --> 14:11.961
said he intended to punch
Councilman Jamm in the face.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.121
And then, he did.

14:13.252 --> 14:14.390
Yeah, but who cares?

14:14.453 --> 14:15.898
He says a lot of things.
He's always talking

14:16.021 --> 14:17.500
about overthrowing
the government,

14:17.556 --> 14:18.728
but he never does that.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.064
Well, that will
make a nice pull quote

14:20.125 --> 14:22.503
for the article about me
taking you to the cleaners.

14:22.995 --> 14:27.273
Mr. Swanson, if you'd like to
make a statement, you may.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.904
On the night I punched
Councilman Jamm in the face,

14:29.969 --> 14:32.245
I warned him
several times to back off.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.647
And instead, he attacked me.
Twice.

14:35.341 --> 14:38.117
Truthfully, I barely
registered his attack.

14:38.177 --> 14:40.453
He's incredibly frail,
and his arms are weak.

14:40.512 --> 14:42.822
When I punched him,
he dropped so quickly,

14:42.882 --> 14:45.556
I thought he was
diving towards the ground.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.461
I regret nothing.
The end.

14:48.120 --> 14:52.296
Well... This turned out
better than I ever imagined.

14:52.358 --> 14:55.635
You got Jammed by your own team.
Self-Jamm.

14:55.694 --> 14:59.005
I'll see you in court, Swanson.
And bring your checkbook.

14:59.064 --> 15:01.704
I would like to punch
you in the face again.

15:02.701 --> 15:04.271
Okay, Paul, let's go.
(PAUL CLEARS THROAT)

15:07.072 --> 15:08.710
LESLIE: I'm glad
you're feeling better.

15:08.774 --> 15:11.618
Well, get your normal conversation
in with me while you can.

15:11.677 --> 15:14.783
We've got about 20 minutes
before I get all loopy again.

15:14.847 --> 15:16.656
Mmm. Let me see the key.

15:16.782 --> 15:19.092
Oh, uh, they took it back.

15:19.151 --> 15:21.392
They wanted to get it engraved.
Huh.

15:21.453 --> 15:22.955
You know, the key
is just a metaphor.

15:23.022 --> 15:25.468
I mean, the real key has
been inside you all along.

15:26.158 --> 15:28.934
It was a set-up, wasn't it? They
were going to make fun of me?

15:29.428 --> 15:31.408
(SIGHS) Yes.

15:31.463 --> 15:34.535
Ice Town was a debacle.
They'll never get over it.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.511
I just don't know
why I got my hopes up.

15:36.568 --> 15:38.445
It's so unfair.
You've worked so hard.

15:38.504 --> 15:40.211
You've done
so many great things.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.274
And for your hometown to treat
you this way is just...

15:44.343 --> 15:45.583
You know what?
Screw this.

15:45.644 --> 15:47.180
We're going to make one
more stop before we leave.

15:47.246 --> 15:48.782
Tuck in your shirt.
We're going to City Hall.

15:49.581 --> 15:53.028
So, Dr. Van Dyne, we took the
compatibility test that you recommended,

15:53.085 --> 15:55.122
and we didn't do amazing.

15:55.187 --> 15:58.259
But I'm sure that happens
with a lot of couples, right?

15:58.324 --> 16:01.100
And it's not like we failed it.
We got a 58%

16:01.160 --> 16:04.164
Which, as I'm saying it, sounds
very clearly like we failed.

16:04.229 --> 16:06.835
Look, there are many ways
to judge compatibility.

16:06.899 --> 16:09.209
Okay, you know what?
Let's do a little exercise.

16:09.268 --> 16:12.272
I'm going to say something
about your future child,

16:12.338 --> 16:14.841
and then you just say the first
thing that pops into your mind.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.716
Okay? Gender.

16:16.775 --> 16:18.448
Girl.
Boy.

16:18.510 --> 16:19.853
Okay. Religion?

16:19.912 --> 16:22.950
Buddhist. Whatever he wants.
Whatever he wants.

16:23.015 --> 16:24.756
How about occupation?

16:24.817 --> 16:27.058
Six time Tour-de-France Champion.
Teacher.

16:27.119 --> 16:28.496
Really?
Okay, I'm sorry.

16:28.554 --> 16:30.033
Are you guys
complete strangers?

16:30.089 --> 16:32.535
Is this one of those
Craigslist father situations?

16:32.591 --> 16:35.504
No, no, no, no. We actually
know each other quite well.

16:35.561 --> 16:39.008
Yeah, we used to date, actually.
But it didn't work out

16:39.064 --> 16:41.670
because we had some
compatibility issues.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.613
You know what? Why don't we just
try one more compatibility test?

16:44.670 --> 16:45.808
Great. Let's do it.

16:45.871 --> 16:47.509
No. Let's not.
(SIGHS)

16:48.507 --> 16:52.080
Well, we all told the truth and
Jamm's definitely going to win.

16:52.144 --> 16:53.452
What do we do now?

16:53.579 --> 16:54.922
I intend to do
as the court orders.

16:54.980 --> 16:58.359
Do you know if one can pay
court-ordered settlements in gold?

16:58.417 --> 17:00.328
All of my money
is in gold.

17:00.386 --> 17:02.127
I also have some
money in palladium.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.598
What if it's a huge amount? Are
you going to be okay financially?

17:04.656 --> 17:07.933
I think so. I'm actually not
sure how much money I have.

17:07.992 --> 17:10.371
But I do know how many
pounds of money I have.

17:10.429 --> 17:12.965
Oh. (CHUCKLES) That is awesome.
TOM: Yes, it is.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.842
And I'm definitely tweeting that to
Drake to use in his next rhymes.

17:15.901 --> 17:19.040
But still. I kind of feel
like this is our fault.

17:19.104 --> 17:22.017
Ugh. Do we have to do
something nice now?

17:23.275 --> 17:25.311
LESLIE: Let me start
by apologizing, Mayor Stice.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.515
I had no right
to disparage your town.

17:27.579 --> 17:30.253
Well, I owe you guys
an apology, too.

17:30.315 --> 17:32.386
I had a little
bad publicity lately.

17:32.451 --> 17:36.228
And frankly, it's still really easy
to score points by bashing Wyatt.

17:36.288 --> 17:39.599
Can't you just give Ben
a key to the city?

17:39.658 --> 17:44.266
Here, now, in your office? Where
no one will know your shame?

17:44.329 --> 17:48.038
Sorry, babe. Aw. No worries.
I love you.

17:48.100 --> 17:52.640
You know, if people found out I
gave Wyatt the key to the city,

17:52.704 --> 17:56.174
I would never
get re-elected, so no.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.585
What're you
doing there, Wyatt?

17:58.644 --> 18:02.649
I'm feeding your eagle.
He's starving.

18:02.714 --> 18:04.352
It's bronze, babe.

18:04.416 --> 18:05.656
Why?

18:05.717 --> 18:06.821
The eagle. We should go.

18:06.952 --> 18:08.090
Yeah.

18:10.189 --> 18:11.463
CHRIS: Ann Perkins?

18:11.523 --> 18:15.300
I know it didn't seem to go
very well at the counselor's.

18:15.360 --> 18:19.433
But I have found a new quiz,
and I think we should take it.

18:19.498 --> 18:22.741
Are you sure? Everything we do
makes it seem like it's a bad idea

18:22.801 --> 18:24.439
for us to have
a kid together.

18:24.503 --> 18:26.073
Maybe we shouldn't
even be friends.

18:26.538 --> 18:27.949
Take a look.

18:28.507 --> 18:30.748
"Will you love our
child and work hard

18:30.876 --> 18:33.117
"to see that he or she
has a good life?"

18:34.046 --> 18:36.287
You see, I think that's the
only question that matters.

18:36.348 --> 18:38.589
All the rest
of it is details.

18:38.984 --> 18:40.190
Yes.

18:40.252 --> 18:42.232
My answer is yes.

18:43.155 --> 18:44.361
I said
the exact same thing.

18:45.023 --> 18:47.526
We are 100%
on the same page.

18:47.926 --> 18:49.303
Are you sure about this?

18:49.361 --> 18:53.867
You are caring,
intelligent, and reliable.

18:53.932 --> 18:57.971
And I am certain that you will
literally be the world's best mom.

18:59.571 --> 19:02.450
Wow.
This is really happening.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.317
You know there's nothing
in there, right?

19:07.379 --> 19:08.483
Yes, sorry.

19:08.547 --> 19:11.619
(LAUGHS) No, I was with Johnny Cougar
Mellencamp at that music fest.

19:11.683 --> 19:15.062
We both thought biggest yabbos
we have ever seen in...

19:15.554 --> 19:17.534
What the hell?
That was important.

19:17.589 --> 19:20.365
Game's over, Councilman.
Drop the suit.

19:20.425 --> 19:22.803
And why, exactly,
would I do that?

19:22.861 --> 19:24.863
We took a look
at your affidavit.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.967
We cross-referenced it
with telephone records

19:27.032 --> 19:29.808
and eyewitness
accounts and...

19:29.868 --> 19:31.973
Uh-oh,
we found 11 lies.

19:32.037 --> 19:33.539
Lying under oath
is called perjury.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.208
And they should know.
They did it yesterday.

19:35.941 --> 19:42.654
Well, I mean, maybe I accidently
said something that wasn't...

19:42.714 --> 19:44.421
Let me see that.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.291
Ow! My wrist!

19:46.351 --> 19:48.922
You twisted my arm
like a maniac! Oh no!

19:48.987 --> 19:50.364
You monster.

19:50.422 --> 19:54.131
Ow! You assaulted me!
And I'm injured!

19:54.193 --> 19:55.501
Oh, my God, Tom.
Are you okay?

19:55.561 --> 19:57.472
All right. You know what?
I see what you're doing.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.530
I barely touched you.

19:58.664 --> 19:59.699
That's not what I saw.

19:59.765 --> 20:02.336
My face.
ls my face still there?

20:02.401 --> 20:03.539
What happened to my knees?

20:03.602 --> 20:05.013
Someone please tell me
if Tom is okay.

20:05.070 --> 20:06.378
Jamm, I'm going to sue you.

20:06.438 --> 20:09.180
Okay. Fine. Hey, listen.

20:09.241 --> 20:13.212
Keep your mouth shut about the
affidavit, I'll drop the suit. Okay?

20:13.278 --> 20:15.383
Hurry, Tom.
Let's get you into surgery.

20:15.614 --> 20:16.888
TOM: Yeah.

20:17.349 --> 20:20.990
Yeah, it's me. We got Jammed.
(DOOR CLOSES)

20:23.188 --> 20:26.135
BEN: My friend Jack and I used
to fish this lake in the summer.

20:26.191 --> 20:31.368
One time, our boat almost tipped over.
But then it didn't.

20:32.264 --> 20:33.607
That's not a great story.

20:33.665 --> 20:35.474
Yeah, I had a pretty
uneventful childhood.

20:36.635 --> 20:38.410
I got you something.

20:39.438 --> 20:41.111
No way.
Yeah.

20:41.173 --> 20:42.743
Where did you get that?

20:42.874 --> 20:44.478
I stole it from
Mayor Stice's office.

20:44.543 --> 20:46.454
Screw that guy.
You should have it.

20:46.511 --> 20:48.320
You're the best wife
in the world.

20:48.380 --> 20:49.484
(CHUCKLES)

20:49.548 --> 20:51.858
But I don't want this.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.327
Really?

20:53.385 --> 20:57.128
Yeah. I mean, I love Partridge,
but I have Pawnee now.

20:57.189 --> 20:58.759
And I have you.

20:58.824 --> 21:01.862
Well, I'm not giving it back to Stice.
That guy sucks.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.568
Yeah.
Well, you know what, then?

21:12.104 --> 21:13.708
(BOTH LAUGH)

21:13.772 --> 21:16.184
Hey! The lake's not
a garbage can, pal.

21:16.241 --> 21:18.278
Yeah, sorry.
It was symbolic.

21:18.343 --> 21:21.153
Is that Ben Wyatt? Get the
hell out of here, Ice Town.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.920
Go, go, go, go.
Run. Run!

21:22.981 --> 21:24.153
LESLIE: Sorry!
