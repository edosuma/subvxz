your father gets to live.

31:27.880 --> 31:29.166
You could do that,

your father along with us.

It would have been easier

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.884
if you just went along
with the rest, you know.

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:49.601
I wasn't there to make money.
I was there to fight a war.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.048
I don't play ball
with people like you.

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:53.844
Well, I can't speak
to the arrangements

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:56.287

makes to get jobs done.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:59.563
I'm just happy I was on the side
that profited from it.

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:03.484
Well, let's just hope you get
what's coming to you.

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:14.969
Qiao, Anna, Maria,
glad you could join us.

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:18.731
Where's my dad?

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.040
Did one of you
bring the ledger?

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.889
Now where's my dad?

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.450

I heard you.

a plan, Junior.

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:02.721
What is this?

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:03.801
You tell us.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.720
What's that supposed
to mean?

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:06.760
You called
the meeting.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.086
I didn't call anything.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:09.650
Cut this shit.
What's this about?

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:11.840
Well, for one, I found the
people who stole from you.

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.723
Right. And he's
right there.

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.406
Listen, I'm getting pretty
sick of you both accusing me

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:17.527
of something
I didn't do.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.523
As a matter of fact, I brought
these people here to kill them.

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:20.601
He's lying.

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:22.526

are you?

I'm Anna and
I work for him.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.086
He told me to
rob you and I did.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.240
We called you here
because he has your money.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:32.761

we're taking the fall for this.</i>

01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.481
Have him show you. Ask him to
show you the bank account.

anybody shit.

for a long time.

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:51.480
Maybe you should.

01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.405
You'll see
he has every penny.

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:00.481
Shut up!

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.881
It's not part of your plan,
this, is it, Junior?

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:18.881
I checked the account this morning.
I have just over 120 million.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.890
I'm gonna lower my gun.
Grab that tablet right there.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.650
Show you the account.
You're gonna see for yourself.

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:28.767
That's a fair start.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.684

Come on.

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:43.761

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:09.207
Okay!

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:12.204
$120 million.
Just as I said.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:17.001
Give it to me.

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.166
This doesn't make sense.

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.771
Don't have the money, huh?

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:29.647
What the hell
did you do?

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:33.245
Exactly what you told me.

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:37.726
I'm gonna rip you up.

Come on.

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.730
Say goodbye
to your money.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.401
You think you can untie
the boat and get it started?

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:16.481
I'll try!

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:25.801
What?

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:35.287
What's the plan, Junior?

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.361
I'll hold them off.

Why do you never carry a gun?

being less critical?

my dad was kidnapped,

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:30.482
<i>If I can't have you
You can't have me</i>

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:35.363
<i>On my own
within my fantasies</i>

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:40.082
<i>If I can't have you
You can't have me</i>

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:45.008
<i>Velvet curtains
and a fireplace</i>

01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:49.405
<i>Leather couches
and rose bouquets</i>

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:54.722
<i>Torn by my senses
I'm paralyzed</i>

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:59.488
<i>I've gone too far to realize</i>

01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:04.129
<i>Doesn't have to make sense</i>

01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:09.042
<i>And I'd rather
fight back again</i>

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:13.683
<i>All alone
Baby, don't you see</i>

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:18.562
<i>If I can't have you
You can't have me</i>

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:23.329
<i>On my own
Within my fantasies</i>

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:27.962

You can't have me</i>

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:33.567

01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:52.051
<i>Oh, you can't,
you can't, you can't</i>

01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:56.771
<i>No, you can't,
you can't, you can't</i>

01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:59.442
<i>No, no</i>

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.887

You can't have me</i>

<i>On my own
And in my fantasies</i>

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:35.283

You can't have me</i>
