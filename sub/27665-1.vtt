00:54.400 --> 00:56.523
Hello. You all right?

01:01.525 --> 01:05.190
Sorry, sorry.
Break up the party and all that.

01:05.191 --> 01:08.150
- Hey!
- Beverley.

01:09.192 --> 01:12.690
Hey! What you saying, Jase?
Hello, Dwayne.

01:12.692 --> 01:15.733
Or should I say "Jay and Hoots"?

01:17.608 --> 01:20.442
Beverley,
you know I don't like them stupid names.

01:22.067 --> 01:24.275
Boys, your friend is upstairs.

01:25.317 --> 01:27.898
Don't just push past,
say excuse me as you're going up.

01:27.900 --> 01:29.025
- Excuse me.
- OK.

01:30.692 --> 01:33.190
Right, who need food?

01:33.192 --> 01:34.608
Auntie, you hungry?

01:35.942 --> 01:38.815
Shut up! Shut up!

01:38.817 --> 01:40.565
What you talking about?

01:40.567 --> 01:42.565
- I can do better than this.
- That's a lie!

01:42.567 --> 01:46.106
- My grandad can play better than this.
- Nah, nah, nah, shut up, shut up.

01:46.108 --> 01:47.940
- Why don't you shut up?
- You should.

01:47.942 --> 01:50.773
- No, you.
- Shut up, you idiot!

01:50.775 --> 01:51.900
You guys, stop!

01:56.275 --> 01:57.567
What!

01:58.525 --> 01:59.942
OK, I'm sorry.

02:17.775 --> 02:18.983
Go on.

02:20.525 --> 02:21.567
Shoot him.

02:25.775 --> 02:27.525
If you're not a pussy.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.400
Shoot... him.

02:52.775 --> 02:54.525
You pick it up,

02:55.317 --> 02:57.067
you have to use it.

03:03.525 --> 03:08.400
Out of all of my foster kids,
you have got to be the stupidest.

03:10.942 --> 03:14.733
Don't you dare touch my gun again.

03:18.233 --> 03:19.608
Now go downstairs...

03:21.275 --> 03:22.650
...and cut your cake.

03:26.733 --> 03:27.900
Go on!

05:27.525 --> 05:28.608
Oi!

05:29.775 --> 05:31.315
Oi!

05:31.317 --> 05:34.856
- Fucking hell's going on here then?
- Easy, fella. Delivery.

05:34.858 --> 05:37.731
- I don't know nothing about a delivery.
- I'm just doing my job.

05:37.733 --> 05:39.940
Fuck's sake, the fork-lift truck's
on the blink.

05:39.942 --> 05:42.690
Jamal, Pete,
you go and help him unload,

05:42.692 --> 05:45.192
I'm gonna find out what the fucking hell's
going on.

06:49.942 --> 06:51.940
- Yo!
- Yo, G.

06:51.942 --> 06:53.481
Everybody dead.

06:53.483 --> 06:54.690
Yeah?

06:54.692 --> 06:57.481
- We'll get money now, yeah?
- Where's Shane? Where's J?

07:14.567 --> 07:16.440
Yo, you, man, I'm in there!

07:16.442 --> 07:19.317
I'm coming, man. Yo, G, come!

07:22.358 --> 07:25.273
Yo! My brothers!

07:25.275 --> 07:26.525
My brothers!

08:03.400 --> 08:06.440
Mm, yeah, clappers, come on.

08:06.442 --> 08:08.648
You're later than I expected.

08:08.650 --> 08:10.690
Listen,
if you'd seen how I was moving in there,

08:10.692 --> 08:14.065
you wouldn't be complaining about nothin'.
It's a real cowboy business.

08:15.608 --> 08:16.775
What's our percentage?

08:18.442 --> 08:19.942
15 per cent.

08:22.025 --> 08:23.525
Some joke ting.

08:24.567 --> 08:25.650
What you say?

08:29.650 --> 08:30.692
Give me your gun.

08:32.692 --> 08:34.482
I said, "Gimme your gun!"

08:43.107 --> 08:45.025
Who teach you how to use this?

08:46.775 --> 08:48.483
Are you me I talk to?

08:49.692 --> 08:50.733
Yeah.

08:52.275 --> 08:53.275
Right.

08:55.942 --> 08:58.690
You ever speak to me like that again,

08:58.692 --> 09:01.733
I'm gonna put three bullets
inside this ear.

09:23.400 --> 09:26.273
<i>I just want to do something
better, do you know what I mean?</i>

09:26.275 --> 09:27.483
<i>For us both.</i>

09:28.942 --> 09:30.317
You know I love him.

09:31.525 --> 09:33.148
You love him?

09:33.150 --> 09:35.067
He means a lot to me.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.650
So nice to see you.

09:40.108 --> 09:42.523
- We should do this more often.
- We should.

09:42.525 --> 09:44.148
- I know.
- We should definitely.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.356
How many clubs have you got?

09:46.358 --> 09:48.942
Hm, now you're asking.

10:04.192 --> 10:07.565
Must be late to this party.
This is looking very cosy.

10:07.567 --> 10:08.898
Very cosy.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.983
Jason. I want you to meet Mustafa.

10:12.067 --> 10:17.775
Mus is one of my most valued clients
and he dabbles in your line of work.

10:19.442 --> 10:21.773
Nice to meet you, bro.

10:21.775 --> 10:22.858
Ready to go?

10:24.900 --> 10:26.773
Come on, Jason, just sit down.

10:26.775 --> 10:28.858
Surely
you don't have to rush off yet.

10:29.567 --> 10:31.731
There's so much we could be talking about.

10:31.733 --> 10:35.731
Selene has been filling me in with
all the information about you and Bev.

10:35.733 --> 10:37.442
- Oh, has she?
- Yeah.

10:42.317 --> 10:45.940
And that beautiful work you done
at the warehouse. Nice.

10:45.942 --> 10:48.523
Clinical... but desperate.

10:48.525 --> 10:52.856
Mustafa...
I've no idea what you're talking about.

10:52.858 --> 10:55.106
Of course you don't.

10:55.108 --> 10:56.525
Of course you don't.

10:57.483 --> 10:59.606
What I'm trying to say is,

10:59.608 --> 11:02.442
Beverley's been running East London
for a long time now.

11:04.067 --> 11:07.440
You see, every good thing
must come to an end, rude boy.

11:07.442 --> 11:08.733
Mind how you talk.

11:10.025 --> 11:13.065
Nothing ain't coming to an end, rude boy.

11:13.067 --> 11:14.525
Are you sure about that?

11:15.483 --> 11:18.606
I'm just giving you a chance to jump ship.

11:18.608 --> 11:20.942
Seeing as we've got mutual friends
and all that.

11:22.317 --> 11:23.525
Mutual friend?

11:26.192 --> 11:27.275
Selene.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.150
Selene!

11:35.733 --> 11:37.608
- I'll speak to you later, OK?
- Yeah.

11:44.733 --> 11:46.065
How do you do this?

11:46.067 --> 11:48.733
- What, you don't need some help?
- Yes, please.

11:50.067 --> 11:53.358
You need to put your body weight on it,
that's why it weren't moving.

11:57.608 --> 11:59.606
- Girl, he's beautiful.
- He is.

11:59.608 --> 12:01.981
- Who sent this man from Heaven?
- Exactly.

12:04.192 --> 12:05.400
I think he's traditional.

12:08.483 --> 12:10.815
- You finished there?
- You know what, yeah?

12:10.817 --> 12:13.648
I'm done.
You're gonna need a new spare tyre,

12:13.650 --> 12:15.523
but you should be good for now.

12:15.525 --> 12:17.898
- Thank you. You saved my life.
- That's cool.

12:17.900 --> 12:20.648
- I just moved in to flat B.
- Yeah?

12:20.650 --> 12:22.898
Be nice if you come round,
get a hot chocolate.

12:22.900 --> 12:25.231
Know what? I don't think my girl
would appreciate that.

12:25.233 --> 12:26.525
- You got a girl?
- Yeah.

12:27.525 --> 12:29.815
- That's fine.
- You take care, man.

12:29.817 --> 12:30.817
See you round.

12:33.525 --> 12:36.231
- Girl, he just swerved me.
- That was rude!

12:36.233 --> 12:38.483
He don't want all of this? Come on.

12:43.900 --> 12:45.440
Wagwan, G-Money?

12:45.442 --> 12:47.398
- You all right?
- Mm.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.023
- When you taking me out to dinner?
- Why you cook?

12:50.025 --> 12:52.315
What happened to cooking,
that's what I'm saying?

12:52.317 --> 12:53.483
Can't cook? Listen...

12:54.608 --> 12:55.608
Come.

12:56.733 --> 12:58.898
<i>Any word on the shipment?</i>

12:58.900 --> 13:00.900
<i>Expecting something to come in today.</i>

13:02.233 --> 13:03.983
<i>I need you boys to go and get the bill.</i>

13:04.733 --> 13:07.692
Man outside a primary school like some...

13:09.067 --> 13:11.483
Come on, bro, where's this youth, bruv?

13:12.525 --> 13:13.775
He's there, man.

13:15.150 --> 13:16.483
Man like Mitch.

13:19.150 --> 13:21.608
What, he's got them machines
and the money in the bag?

13:23.108 --> 13:24.150
Course.

13:27.233 --> 13:30.231
Don't ever pick me up
this early again, you know.

13:30.233 --> 13:31.856
You know I like my sleep still.

13:31.858 --> 13:34.192
All right, Sleeping Beauty.

13:40.608 --> 13:42.150
Hey, Vincent, sit down.

13:43.817 --> 13:47.190
- Morning, Cosmo.
- Good morning, Mr Bryant.

13:47.192 --> 13:50.023
- See you later, alligator.
- In a while, crocodile.

13:50.025 --> 13:51.233
Have a good day.

14:05.900 --> 14:08.190
Oh, my days, look.

14:08.192 --> 14:10.148
Money Ting's Insta, yeah?

14:10.150 --> 14:12.400
- Is that the ting, yeah?
- Yeah, look at her.

14:13.733 --> 14:16.815
You're loved up, you're not even meant
to be looking at that.

14:16.817 --> 14:18.442
That don't mean I can't preview.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.148
Look at that car behind.

14:22.150 --> 14:23.731
It's been following us.

14:23.733 --> 14:27.148
- It's a five-door.
- That's Jake's.

14:27.150 --> 14:28.150
New plate.

14:29.483 --> 14:30.731
Brah, they're speeding up.

14:30.733 --> 14:32.775
- Oh, my days.
- Fuck's sake.

14:47.067 --> 14:49.065
Get out the car, please, boys.

14:49.067 --> 14:51.023
Out the car.
Turn the engine off, please, sir.

14:51.025 --> 14:53.315
Jason, can you get out the car, please?

14:53.317 --> 14:57.231
I'm arresting you on distribution
of class A drugs

14:57.233 --> 14:59.858
and possession of firearms.
Let's go for a walk, son.

15:01.608 --> 15:03.856
If you'd like to put your pencils down,
please.

15:03.858 --> 15:06.190
Keep quiet. Get up. That's it.

15:06.192 --> 15:08.356
In twos, by the door.

15:08.358 --> 15:09.856
Nice... Nice and quick now.

15:09.858 --> 15:13.565
That's it, darling, this way. That's it.
There we are.

15:13.567 --> 15:17.398
Quickly. That's it, file out. Out you go.
It's all right, we'll get it later.

15:17.400 --> 15:21.192
That's it. Well done. Quick as you can.
Nice and quiet.

15:22.900 --> 15:23.900
Fantastic.

15:25.650 --> 15:27.400
There we are. Hurry up.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.400
Bingo.

16:36.275 --> 16:37.275
What?

16:40.442 --> 16:41.606
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

16:41.608 --> 16:45.315
Forget it, forget it, forget it.
Relax, bro, relax. Relax.

16:45.317 --> 16:47.067
Come on. Clappers.

16:53.525 --> 16:57.065
- Who, that Robocop one?
- What's he got a towel on his head?

16:57.067 --> 16:58.940
- Who the fuck is he?
- We fucked up his brother

16:58.942 --> 17:00.192
when we was younger.

17:01.233 --> 17:02.773
Fuck it, man.

17:02.775 --> 17:05.065
- What's the problem, bruv?
- What's going on, bro?

17:05.067 --> 17:06.233
Is there a problem, bruv?

17:07.358 --> 17:08.942
Nervous. Nervous.

17:13.108 --> 17:14.315
Get out!

17:14.317 --> 17:15.442
Get out!

17:17.317 --> 17:18.317
Get out!

17:21.275 --> 17:24.650
Seven... eight... nine...

17:26.067 --> 17:27.067
...ten.

17:28.900 --> 17:29.942
Mad ting.

17:30.900 --> 17:33.606
I need a shower, man.
Hey, let me get a shampoo, brother.

17:33.608 --> 17:34.856
Shampoo?

17:34.858 --> 17:36.898
- Hey, man, that is low.
- Low?

17:36.900 --> 17:39.773
- Low.
- You work for Bev. What does that mean?

17:39.775 --> 17:43.023
She's been taking care of herself,
she don't care about us, man.

17:43.025 --> 17:45.606
What's going on with your brother,
you heard from him?

17:45.608 --> 17:48.773
I have, you know. They shipped my man
to some jail in Wales.

17:48.775 --> 17:53.523
Wales? They're handling men like that?

17:53.525 --> 17:54.565
Mad.

17:54.567 --> 17:57.856
But she's saying they haven't been able
to visit him still, sad.

17:57.858 --> 17:59.731
My man's only got, what, 18 months left?

17:59.733 --> 18:02.398
Yeah, he's gonna be a D-cat soon.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.773
18 months. He'll be home in a minute, man.

18:04.775 --> 18:07.067
Man go every day, my brother. Trust me.

18:09.942 --> 18:11.648
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

18:11.650 --> 18:15.106
- You gonna get involved?
- In what? Man's controlling this area.

18:15.108 --> 18:17.773
- Go back over your side, bro.
- Just wanted to use the weights.

18:17.775 --> 18:19.690
Fuck that, bruv.
Step over to your side, bro.

18:19.692 --> 18:21.648
- Be easy, G, man.
- No, fuck that, man.

18:21.650 --> 18:24.065
Can't man bang weights in peace?

18:28.067 --> 18:29.317
You fucking mug.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.733
Get off! Get off!

18:53.692 --> 18:55.065
Wagwan?

18:55.067 --> 18:59.606
The London boy catching on
the fucking gym. Good though, bruv.

18:59.608 --> 19:02.608
Up on that, rude boy. What's good?

19:06.025 --> 19:08.523
You see my man?
My man look like Robocop.

19:08.525 --> 19:10.231
You see when he was over me?

19:10.233 --> 19:11.481
- The little small one?
- Nah.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.190
That's the one I don't like. Him.

19:13.192 --> 19:16.606
I heard them running up and down the wing
the other day, fam.

19:16.608 --> 19:18.648
Yeah, but now he's rolling
with them Birmingham ones.

19:18.650 --> 19:21.023
I'm gonna bust his head open,
trust me on that one.

19:21.025 --> 19:23.523
- You say the face is bad?
- Yeah, it's bad, rude boy.

19:23.525 --> 19:25.940
I've got a visit coming as well
to check me.

19:25.942 --> 19:28.773
Don't worry who I got visiting me.

19:28.775 --> 19:31.065
I see you on the visit
the other day, though.

19:31.067 --> 19:34.190
- I see how you're moving, dog.
- The little skirt?

19:34.192 --> 19:36.106
The one in the short skirt?

19:36.108 --> 19:37.483
What do you mean, fam?

19:38.817 --> 19:40.440
What? Fam.

19:40.442 --> 19:44.523
Being in jail, you talk about all these
girls, they ain't seen one ting. Not one.

19:44.525 --> 19:47.192
- I ain't seen not one.
- They're in the ghetto waiting for me.

19:48.525 --> 19:51.650
One minute. What's going on?

19:52.692 --> 19:54.148
Wagwan?

19:54.150 --> 19:56.856
- Why you coming over here, rude boy?
- I ain't come here for that, fam.

19:56.858 --> 19:59.065
- What you come for then?
- To speak to the big man.

19:59.067 --> 20:01.898
You don't speak to no big man, fam.
What you talking about?

20:01.900 --> 20:04.731
- Yo, G.
- Hey, shall we get this cracking, fam?

20:04.733 --> 20:07.690
- You're talking to no one.
- You forget all of that, fam.

20:07.692 --> 20:10.773
- What you looking at?
- Brother, take the bass out your voice.

20:10.775 --> 20:13.565
- What bass out of my voice?
- Where's your fucking sleeves, fam?

20:13.567 --> 20:15.356
You think you're in Marbella
or something?

20:15.358 --> 20:17.523
- Comedian, innit?
- Yeah, joker, fam.

20:17.525 --> 20:20.273
What? Talk then, what's going on?

20:20.275 --> 20:22.648
- How can we sort this out?
- Sort out what?

20:22.650 --> 20:25.690
- See what you've done to my face?
- That's what I'm trying to sort out.

20:25.692 --> 20:28.231
You want to sort out?
Come on then, let's go sort it out.

20:28.233 --> 20:30.690
Forget all of that.

20:30.692 --> 20:33.398
It's cool, it's cool, it's cool.
All right, we'll sort it out.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.690
- Me and you, then?
- Yeah. We'll talk.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.856
- All right, cool.
- He looks excited.

20:37.858 --> 20:40.356
Yeah, I'm excited about everything,
big man.

20:40.358 --> 20:43.356
- Catch you on the rebound.
- Catch me on the rebound, rude boy?

20:43.358 --> 20:44.442
He speaks.

20:46.067 --> 20:49.481
You see my man, I don't like him.
I'm gonna bust his head open.

20:49.483 --> 20:50.942
Don't like him at all.

21:03.567 --> 21:07.815
Wagwan? I come in peace.
Calm down, brother. Panicking.

21:07.817 --> 21:09.606
You shook.

21:09.608 --> 21:11.608
You don't mind
if I make myself comfortable?

21:16.275 --> 21:18.150
Let me apologize on behalf of G.

21:19.942 --> 21:21.692
My misunderstanding.

21:23.608 --> 21:25.025
Apology accepted.

21:26.233 --> 21:27.983
Now get the fuck out of here.

21:30.525 --> 21:32.108
I heard you got a Tec flying about.

21:33.150 --> 21:35.523
If you let me use that,
I'll make sure you and your people

21:35.525 --> 21:37.358
are well looked after here, bruv.

21:38.317 --> 21:42.067
My people are good, G.
Don't need no looking after.

21:43.442 --> 21:44.856
Very aggressive.

21:44.858 --> 21:48.898
Anyway, this Tec,
you know what the powers are.

21:48.900 --> 21:50.567
Let me make one or two calls...

21:51.608 --> 21:53.231
...deal with what I got to deal with,

21:53.233 --> 21:55.775
and I can pattern something for you
in the process.

21:59.233 --> 22:00.817
Think about it, innit.

22:06.108 --> 22:07.483
Yes!

22:21.192 --> 22:22.192
Wagwan?

22:44.567 --> 22:45.692
Who's this?

22:47.275 --> 22:51.065
Hey. Why are you calling me
on this dodgy number?

22:51.067 --> 22:54.898
<i>Look, whatever big move
you're doing with Bev,</i>

22:54.900 --> 23:00.192
needs to lead to result,
because now we have responsibilities.

23:03.525 --> 23:04.525
I'm pregnant.

23:05.942 --> 23:07.692
<i>Aren't you gonna say something?</i>

23:22.942 --> 23:24.900
Behind the doors, lads, come on.

25:44.567 --> 25:46.483
How'd your man get out, though?

25:48.692 --> 25:52.606
They didn't find no food on us.
No guns on us.

25:52.608 --> 25:54.192
What, that teacher?

25:55.358 --> 25:57.398
My son liked that teacher, still.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.273
Your son don't like us?

25:59.275 --> 26:03.690
Bro, bro, bro, what would you rather?
Live a basic life as a teacher,

26:03.692 --> 26:06.065
or go to jail,
sit down for a little bit of time,

26:06.067 --> 26:08.275
and know that your family's
well looked after?

26:09.900 --> 26:13.565
I'd rather be a teacher, blood,
man heard you get bare holidays, fam.

26:13.567 --> 26:16.481
The teacher's good, man,
don't worry about him, he'll be all right.

26:16.483 --> 26:20.440
- Mitch, jail's not for you, you know.
- I know fam, I'm not trying to go to jail.

26:20.442 --> 26:22.150
No offence, man, but...

26:23.067 --> 26:25.190
You man our back, so what's the motive?

26:25.192 --> 26:26.856
My work's here in London.

26:26.858 --> 26:29.940
Bruv, come on, you know work's slow
when you men are not about.

26:29.942 --> 26:33.231
Anyone making moves, I don't care
if it's big moves, small moves, whatever.

26:33.233 --> 26:36.231
You gotta be on to them.
Get this money back up.

26:36.233 --> 26:38.606
Welcome back, my brothers. Chase!

27:01.900 --> 27:03.315
So answer.

27:03.317 --> 27:06.398
It's the boy I was telling you about,
he's gonna work for...

27:06.400 --> 27:07.400
With us.

27:08.358 --> 27:09.567
Welcome to the business.

27:11.233 --> 27:12.608
So how's this gonna run?

27:14.275 --> 27:18.731
You're gonna tell us about Bev's set-up.
Logistics, storage, alliances.

27:18.733 --> 27:22.025
Any businesses that exist as a front.
Everything.

27:23.525 --> 27:25.858
- Snitching.
- Far from it.

27:27.192 --> 27:30.317
If you're getting cold feet,
the door's there.

27:35.108 --> 27:36.358
Nah, I'm good.

27:37.858 --> 27:39.983
Let's start with the warehouse robbery.

27:43.525 --> 27:45.108
Answer your phone, bro.

27:49.150 --> 27:50.650
Yo, G.

27:51.775 --> 27:53.648
No, I'm tied up, you know.

27:53.650 --> 27:54.817
Let me hit you back.

27:56.483 --> 27:57.483
Safe.

27:58.650 --> 28:00.273
G-Money?

28:00.275 --> 28:03.858
If he weren't Bev's little skivvy,
he'd actually get somewhere, you know?

28:05.525 --> 28:08.523
So you do know the...
The warehouse was ours, right?

28:08.525 --> 28:10.023
What?

28:10.025 --> 28:12.817
Don't stress. We're not out for revenge.

28:14.108 --> 28:16.817
Looks like you got somewhere else to be
anyway.

28:18.233 --> 28:21.692
Like I told you, Mustafa... I'm good.

28:25.567 --> 28:28.523
Listen, listen, I'm in
a good mood, innit. I'm gonna let you off.

28:28.525 --> 28:29.606
Thank you.

28:29.608 --> 28:32.106
Make sure you tell all your friends
about Jason.

28:32.108 --> 28:33.898
I run this block, do you understand?

28:33.900 --> 28:35.898
- Who runs this block? Huh?
- Jason.

28:35.900 --> 28:37.815
- Huh?
- You. Jason. Jason.

28:37.817 --> 28:40.648
- Jason runs the block.
- Jason runs the block.

28:40.650 --> 28:43.023
- Get out of here. Wagwan?
- Listen, listen.

28:43.025 --> 28:45.358
Our man's fucking block, are you mad?

28:47.192 --> 28:48.773
What you doing?

28:48.775 --> 28:50.065
Pig in the city. Get up!

28:50.067 --> 28:52.648
G-Money, I thought you was lock, fam.

28:52.650 --> 28:54.565
You thought what? You thought what?

28:54.567 --> 28:56.233
Empty your pockets.

28:57.608 --> 28:59.358
- Don't hit me, fam.
- What's this?

29:00.400 --> 29:02.690
- Is that everything?
- King of the block with a bus pass,

29:02.692 --> 29:05.398
you clown.

29:05.400 --> 29:06.981
Give me the rest.

29:06.983 --> 29:09.523
Where's the grub?
Where's the food? Where's the food?

29:09.525 --> 29:13.231
I want the rest of the food, yeah?
Or I'm gonna stab you. You hear me?

29:13.233 --> 29:15.150
- All right...
- Where's the rest? Now.

29:18.025 --> 29:19.356
Oh.

29:19.358 --> 29:20.856
Oh.

29:20.858 --> 29:22.108
OK.

29:23.067 --> 29:25.273
Where'd you get this food from?

29:25.275 --> 29:27.190
Where you get the food?
Can't hear what he said?

29:27.192 --> 29:28.606
The Turks, the Turks.

29:28.608 --> 29:31.190
The Turks?
So you're running with the Turks?

29:31.192 --> 29:33.733
- They got better food, fam.
- OK.

29:34.733 --> 29:37.648
Don't let me catch you with no food again,
do you hear me?

29:37.650 --> 29:41.023
- Not even chicken and chips, rude boy.
- What did he say?

29:41.025 --> 29:44.358
- Not even chicken and chips, innit.
- Now, cool. Come on, get out of here.

29:45.275 --> 29:47.690
Don't let me catch you around here again.
Prick.

29:47.692 --> 29:49.900
- Did you hear what he said?
- Turks.

29:51.150 --> 29:52.192
What you thinking?

30:07.192 --> 30:09.983
Get the fuck down! Get the fuck down!

30:19.233 --> 30:22.483
Get the fuck down! Face down!

30:29.192 --> 30:32.650
Oi, you, get me a drink.
Get me a fucking drink.

30:41.108 --> 30:42.567
No ice, no ice.

30:46.358 --> 30:48.898
Yo! Where's the fucking food, man?

30:48.900 --> 30:51.481
- We don't serve food back here.
- I'm not talking about kebab!

30:51.483 --> 30:54.690
- Where's the fucking food, bro?
- Do you know who I am, my friend?

30:54.692 --> 30:56.692
I don't give a fuck. Now where's the food?

30:59.233 --> 31:02.025
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:02.650 --> 31:04.023
What the fuck is this?

31:04.025 --> 31:06.523
Big Turkish dealer like you
and one fucking brick?!

31:06.525 --> 31:08.731
Hey, get on your knees.
Get on your fucking knees!

31:08.733 --> 31:10.690
Hey, listen, I can give you a job.

31:10.692 --> 31:13.481
My nephew was here this morning
talking to one of your people,

31:13.483 --> 31:15.315
I know you have drought problem.

31:15.317 --> 31:18.148
You work for me, I make you a rich man.

31:18.150 --> 31:20.023
Get on the floor, motherfucker.

31:20.025 --> 31:22.356
Where's the food? Where's the food?

31:22.358 --> 31:25.148
Listen to me, blood,
I only work for one person, yeah?

31:25.150 --> 31:28.400
That's cos she raised me. You don't
look like no Jamaican woman to me.

31:30.858 --> 31:32.190
Now, talk, yeah!

31:32.192 --> 31:34.481
- Talk now! Talk!
- I...

31:34.483 --> 31:37.231
- Where? Fucking talk up!
- Drawer.

31:37.233 --> 31:40.608
Drawer, drawer, drawer, drawer.
Where's that bag? Where's that bag?

31:41.525 --> 31:45.731
Mm, what's this? Yeah? What do you say?

31:45.733 --> 31:47.523
Nothing there, blood.

31:47.525 --> 31:49.856
Bricks, fam.

31:49.858 --> 31:51.856
Phwoar!

31:51.858 --> 31:54.025
OK. This is what you was hiding, yeah?

31:59.567 --> 32:00.940
You, man, hurry up!

32:00.942 --> 32:04.565
I told you, put your fucking head down!

32:04.567 --> 32:06.400
Quick, quick, quick. OK.

32:08.025 --> 32:09.025
Yo.

32:10.317 --> 32:13.108
Do you smoke this shit?
You need it, you're in pain.

32:15.567 --> 32:17.567
You, man, hurry up! Hurry up!

32:19.567 --> 32:21.275
I said, don't look at me!

32:30.150 --> 32:32.523
I offered to step out tonight,
I'm not gonna lie.

32:32.525 --> 32:33.565
Yeah, trust me.

32:33.567 --> 32:36.315
I was going on at them Turks
like anything. They're light, bruv.

32:36.317 --> 32:39.190
- The moves were mad, still.
- It was mad, G, I'm not gonna lie.

32:39.192 --> 32:41.023
Man should all have got a kebab in there.

32:41.025 --> 32:43.023
And halloumi cheese,
you know what I'm saying?

32:44.358 --> 32:46.481
- Trust me.
- Know what's so funny though?

32:46.483 --> 32:49.148
Every time I link with man dem,
I just make money.

32:49.150 --> 32:51.523
Come on, Blacks, man,
you know we're the dream team.

32:51.525 --> 32:53.273
Clappers to you, clappers.

32:53.275 --> 32:55.481
- What's going on?
- Wagwan?

32:55.483 --> 32:56.650
Your man.

32:57.483 --> 33:00.065
What, Bev come through all this food,
yeah?

33:00.067 --> 33:03.065
Nah, man got this off some Turkish people,
still.

33:03.067 --> 33:05.773
A little Turkish delight,
you know what I'm saying?

33:05.775 --> 33:07.940
- All of it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:07.942 --> 33:10.940
- With a little persuasion.
- You robbed them?

33:10.942 --> 33:12.400
Yeah, I robbed them, and what?

33:15.483 --> 33:17.815
- Why the fuck you rob them?
- Cos I wanted to. What?

33:17.817 --> 33:19.025
I called you, bro.

33:20.567 --> 33:23.231
- How'm I meant to know you're calling me?
- Bro, bro, listen.

33:23.233 --> 33:25.856
We spent our money on the lawyers.
The police took man's grub.

33:25.858 --> 33:27.815
No connect though
when I give my no consignment.

33:27.817 --> 33:30.440
I use my fucking initiative.
What are you doing?

33:30.442 --> 33:32.817
Fucking...

33:33.900 --> 33:36.231
- What's wrong with you, man?
- Chill out, man.

33:36.233 --> 33:37.731
- The fuck, man?
- Why mention money?

33:37.733 --> 33:39.190
Calm down, you mad man.

33:39.192 --> 33:42.523
Bev's gonna be happy,
we got all the food, man.

33:42.525 --> 33:45.940
Mitch, get your head out of Bev's batty.

33:45.942 --> 33:49.731
I'm scheming, man.
You see the next time you go on a move,

33:49.733 --> 33:52.773
have the common courtesy to let me know,
innit. Yeah?

33:52.775 --> 33:55.315
And I will be liking my cut.
Thank you in advance.

33:55.317 --> 33:57.733
Man wants his cut
and he didn't even come on the move.

34:10.025 --> 34:12.692
<i>I use my fucking initiative.
Where you from, bro?</i>

34:17.192 --> 34:21.233
<i>It's the guy I was telling you
about, he's gonna work for... With us.</i>

34:22.358 --> 34:24.192
<i>Welcome to the business.</i>

34:37.733 --> 34:40.606
<i>You're three hours' late for your trim.
You're not getting no trim.</i>

34:40.608 --> 34:43.273
Your hair was like that
before you ever come here, bro.

34:43.275 --> 34:47.023
Bro, you got pepper grains anyway, man,
suck your girl, you dickhead, man.

34:47.025 --> 34:48.358
Whoa.

34:49.525 --> 34:52.148
Anyway, anyway, anyway,
listen, listen, listen.

34:52.150 --> 34:56.356
I must've been out last night, yeah?
I see my man's gal in the dance, fam.

34:56.358 --> 34:59.273
- Who's "my man"?
- My man from...

34:59.275 --> 35:02.065
- Who, the lanky lad?
- Yeah.

35:02.067 --> 35:05.898
Always trying to act like he's bad.
Fam, the way his gal was moving,

35:05.900 --> 35:06.940
I knew it, you know.

35:06.942 --> 35:09.106
One time, she come in here,
she smelt like fish.

35:18.150 --> 35:20.481
What's going on? What's going on?

35:20.483 --> 35:21.650
What's going on?

35:24.317 --> 35:26.606
- So, wagwan, cuz?
- Wagwan, cuzzy?

35:26.608 --> 35:29.773
- Business booming as usual.
- Business is booming, yeah?

35:29.775 --> 35:33.356
G, make sure you warn me before you bring
people to my shop, you know.

35:33.358 --> 35:35.856
- Who you talking about...
- Cool, cool, cool.

35:35.858 --> 35:36.692
He's family.

35:37.942 --> 35:39.025
Wagwan for my man?

35:44.067 --> 35:46.731
You know what, let's go over there
and talk comfortably, man.

35:46.733 --> 35:47.775
G, come, man.

35:54.650 --> 35:55.940
So what you saying?

35:55.942 --> 35:58.190
- You ain't got a drought?
- What you mean, drought?

35:58.192 --> 36:00.648
That's some East London talk.

36:00.650 --> 36:04.148
I ain't even gonna lie,
Bev's ting's low right now, cuz.

36:04.150 --> 36:06.273
You lot still getting food
from the Yardies, yeah?

36:07.692 --> 36:09.898
Who your man picking up off?

36:09.900 --> 36:12.606
I mean, no one wants to find his uncle,
man.

36:12.608 --> 36:16.148
- Turks as well.
- I see you're bridging over there still.

36:16.150 --> 36:20.356
- What bridging?
- You know J, man? He's linking Mus.

36:20.358 --> 36:23.356
J. What I tell you about J?
Fucking snake, bro.

36:23.358 --> 36:24.773
You don't know that for sure yet.

36:24.775 --> 36:27.898
I don't know if Mus has got
some special shisha in the office,

36:27.900 --> 36:31.942
- but he was 100 per cent there.
- That guy's been sly.

36:34.067 --> 36:36.025
J, yeah, you see him there.

36:37.442 --> 36:40.565
- Respect, cuz, always a pleasure.
- Yeah?

36:40.567 --> 36:41.898
On the rebound, my brother.

36:41.900 --> 36:45.190
Any time you need a trim,
just pass through, my brother.

36:45.192 --> 36:47.650
You, be safe, my brother, yeah?

36:50.400 --> 36:51.983
Mandem all safe, man.

37:19.233 --> 37:22.273
Fuck's this? What you doing? Huh?

37:22.275 --> 37:23.275
What you doing?

37:25.358 --> 37:28.106
- Swear to God, I...
- Sit down.

37:28.108 --> 37:29.150
Sit down.

37:30.442 --> 37:32.150
Muscle, huh?

37:38.900 --> 37:41.273
What's all this about then?

37:41.275 --> 37:44.358
You're not really in the position
to start asking questions, are you?

37:45.525 --> 37:48.773
Yeah. Now relax, get comfy.

37:48.775 --> 37:51.565
Come in my yard with these two buffoons
talking about relax,

37:51.567 --> 37:53.856
- that's mad disrespectful.
- Mad disrespectful.

37:53.858 --> 37:55.523
I'll tell you fucking disrespectful.

37:55.525 --> 37:58.690
The last time we spoke, we were supposed
to be doing business together.

37:58.692 --> 38:01.898
Now my uncle's lying in intensive care.
That's fucking disrespectful.

38:01.900 --> 38:04.190
I'm sorry to hear that
but it had nothing to do with me.

38:04.192 --> 38:06.773
Don't fucking lie to me, boy.

38:06.775 --> 38:08.775
When they move, you move.

38:10.900 --> 38:13.233
You know what, yeah?

38:14.317 --> 38:15.942
I'm gonna take care of them.

38:17.317 --> 38:18.898
In the meantime...

38:18.900 --> 38:20.900
- Hey.
- Chill out, man.

38:27.317 --> 38:28.858
Go reimburse them for food.

38:31.650 --> 38:33.525
Put your little money away, man.

38:45.108 --> 38:47.817
See... I got a vision.

38:49.900 --> 38:52.315
And in my vision,

38:52.317 --> 38:55.233
the whole ras clart of London
picks up off of me.

38:57.358 --> 39:00.817
And right now, there's only one person
standing in my way.

39:04.733 --> 39:06.523
Bev.

39:06.525 --> 39:08.023
Yeah.

39:08.025 --> 39:11.065
And that's why
you're gonna get rid of her for me.

39:13.525 --> 39:15.815
Ah, funny guy.

39:15.817 --> 39:18.650
I don't mind giving you info and what not.

39:19.692 --> 39:21.731
Bev's like family, I ain't killing her.

39:21.733 --> 39:23.398
It ain't happening.

39:23.400 --> 39:26.442
OK. You do what you gotta do.

39:27.567 --> 39:29.192
She ain't easy to touch, you know.

40:11.483 --> 40:14.856
- All right, boys?
- Yeah, you been in the gym, yeah?

40:14.858 --> 40:17.190
You know, gotta work out.

40:17.192 --> 40:18.192
Bevs.

40:19.358 --> 40:21.192
You know my man's
having a baby.

40:22.233 --> 40:23.192
What?

40:24.317 --> 40:25.483
And you never tell me?

40:26.525 --> 40:28.231
When's the baby shower?

40:28.233 --> 40:30.523
Soon as we find out
if it's a boy or a girl.

40:30.525 --> 40:32.400
Well, congratulations.

40:33.442 --> 40:35.983
I'm gonna spoil that baby
something rotten.

40:44.817 --> 40:47.150
<i>I got a final solution for our...</i>

40:48.608 --> 40:50.440
...drought.

40:50.442 --> 40:51.608
I'm listening.

40:53.525 --> 40:56.148
Me want you boys to go to Jamaica.

40:59.733 --> 41:02.192
<i>Take care of our little rat infestation.</i>

41:06.692 --> 41:07.858
That's suicide.

41:13.192 --> 41:15.483
Suicide...

41:17.650 --> 41:20.192
...is being seen in broad daylight...

41:22.692 --> 41:24.233
...with the opposition.

41:45.233 --> 41:48.442
- How long you been working for the Turks?
- It ain't even like that.

41:54.150 --> 41:55.150
Get up!

41:56.650 --> 41:59.733
- What?
- That's right about her style.

42:02.150 --> 42:05.108
Now you are jumping on that plane...

42:06.108 --> 42:07.317
...to Jamaica.

42:08.608 --> 42:09.608
Right?

42:16.358 --> 42:18.856
Make sure he gets on that plane.

42:18.858 --> 42:19.942
And when you're rich...

42:22.025 --> 42:23.150
...you know what to do.

42:39.108 --> 42:40.273
Is everything all right?

42:40.275 --> 42:42.731
Definitely had better days,
you know, darling.

42:42.733 --> 42:44.606
Fucking G-Money and that.

42:44.608 --> 42:47.358
I can believe Bev
but G, that's my brother.

42:48.317 --> 42:49.650
They robbed the Turks, innit.

42:50.692 --> 42:52.442
- And now this.
- Now what?

42:53.650 --> 42:55.940
Bev wants me to go Jamaica
and kill someone.

42:55.942 --> 42:57.192
What?

43:00.942 --> 43:02.608
I'm feeling like it's a set-up.

43:04.233 --> 43:06.148
Like, if I go there,
they're gonna kill me.

43:06.150 --> 43:09.773
Yeah? And if I don't,
they're gonna kill me here.

43:09.775 --> 43:12.273
Either way, I'm a dead man walking.

43:12.275 --> 43:15.231
J, why would they kill you?

43:15.233 --> 43:16.315
I don't know.

43:16.317 --> 43:18.483
Seriously, J, why would they kill you?

43:20.025 --> 43:21.775
I don't believe that for a second.

43:25.483 --> 43:26.817
Do you know what I think?

43:27.775 --> 43:29.440
I think you should go there.

43:29.442 --> 43:31.565
- Serious?
- Yes.

43:31.567 --> 43:34.023
I think you should go to Jamaica.

43:34.025 --> 43:35.733
And meet the main connect.

43:37.567 --> 43:38.900
Seriously, think about it.

43:39.817 --> 43:42.856
You don't wanna go from being
a soldier for Beverley

43:42.858 --> 43:45.317
to being some slave for Mustafa.

43:48.900 --> 43:49.900
So, go.

43:53.233 --> 43:55.606
- <i>Who this?</i>
- <i>Yeah, my brother.</i>

43:55.608 --> 43:57.023
- <i>How's the play?</i>
- <i>Gunz.</i>

43:57.025 --> 44:00.023
My brother.
What you saying, you on the roads?

44:00.025 --> 44:03.481
Moving to your bits with my gal, bro,
in LON.

44:03.483 --> 44:05.023
Into my bits.

44:05.025 --> 44:07.106
It's all right, you can take me out,
you know.

44:07.108 --> 44:08.648
You reached my phone in jail.

44:08.650 --> 44:11.106
Take me for food or buy me trainers, bro.

44:11.108 --> 44:14.775
Oh, definitely, it would be an honor,
but I'm flying out tomorrow, you know.

44:15.733 --> 44:20.106
Yeah, that's a mad coincidence still.
My nan just passed away in Jamaica,

44:20.108 --> 44:22.023
so I'm gonna take a little trip.

44:22.025 --> 44:24.356
<i>I'm sorry to hear that, you know, bro.</i>

44:24.358 --> 44:26.940
I'm gonna be all over the place.

44:26.942 --> 44:30.356
Oh, definitely, shout me, brother.
Soon as you touch. You get me?

44:30.358 --> 44:32.023
- Link up.
- Mad.

44:32.025 --> 44:34.231
It's gonna be a mad link-up,
my brother.

44:34.233 --> 44:35.233
Done.

44:37.900 --> 44:39.981
Oh! Result.

44:54.775 --> 44:56.898
Swear that's my man, there.

44:56.900 --> 44:59.606
Brah, is that my man in the orange?

44:59.608 --> 45:02.023
Looking like a Tango or something.

45:02.025 --> 45:04.106
Mind how you're talking, you know.

45:04.108 --> 45:05.356
No.

45:05.358 --> 45:06.731
Is that the man named G-Money?

45:06.733 --> 45:08.898
Yeah, it's me still, wagwan?

45:08.900 --> 45:10.440
- Wagwan, fam?
- Yeah, man.

45:10.442 --> 45:13.856
- Er, er, man's J.
- Oh, J, how's things, man?

45:13.858 --> 45:15.773
Nah, he's a boss still.

45:15.775 --> 45:19.690
Man like Shane, you know.
You need anything, Sour Sap, it's done.

45:19.692 --> 45:25.315
For Sour Sap. Make sure
don't put to that to the test already.

45:25.317 --> 45:28.148
He's a shooter, he's one of my shooters.

45:28.150 --> 45:30.525
Yeah.

45:39.900 --> 45:44.606
We have a situation where Sour Sap
and his sister, Beverley,

45:44.608 --> 45:46.525
they're moving bare cocaine in England.

45:47.817 --> 45:52.565
<i>This boy want mansion,

48:00.692 --> 48:02.648
- Yeah, we're good.
- Mm-hmm.

48:02.650 --> 48:07.150
No disrespect, Mr Sour Sap,
but where can I find a gal like this?

48:08.733 --> 48:14.733
Yo, bad man, you can't find no girl
like Peaches. No, not for better.

49:46.275 --> 49:48.648

Could you live out here?

50:23.358 --> 50:25.356

50:25.358 --> 50:29.067
Boy, I run London, I come out here,

51:24.608 --> 51:29.315
I'd like to thank you for the General,
for showing us the time of our lives.

51:29.317 --> 51:31.481
I'd like to thank you

Amen!

51:42.442 --> 51:45.023
- Let's eat.
- No, man. No, man.

51:45.025 --> 51:46.898
Hey, woman.

51:46.900 --> 51:49.231
Who want a drink?

51:49.233 --> 51:51.065
Who wants the dragonstone?

52:44.192 --> 52:46.898
So, yo, blood.

52:46.900 --> 52:49.940
Do you think we can trust the new guy,
blood?

52:49.942 --> 52:52.731
We not know enough.
We not know them.

52:52.733 --> 52:56.898
No, the only one I know is G-Money.
Only one I heard of.

52:56.900 --> 52:58.650
I don't know none of the rest of them.

53:03.567 --> 53:05.523
- The one with the glasses?
- Yeah.

53:05.525 --> 53:08.815
Nah, man, never heard of him, bro. Never.

53:08.817 --> 53:11.025
The next one, his name's Shane.

53:12.525 --> 53:15.690
At the end of the day,
we'll put them to our local test, blood.

53:15.692 --> 53:18.940
You don't want a man to let you down
in the streets, bro.

53:18.942 --> 53:20.606
- Yeah.
- We have to do that, you know.

53:20.608 --> 53:21.608
Yeah.

53:39.733 --> 53:41.567
Licence and registration.

53:43.650 --> 53:46.356

- Shut up!

53:46.358 --> 53:48.065
Put your hands on the car.

53:48.067 --> 53:49.650
Put your hands on the car!

53:50.858 --> 53:52.731
Turn round.

53:52.733 --> 53:55.233
He is a smart ass? Eh?

53:55.858 --> 53:58.481
Till you step out. Where you from?

53:58.483 --> 53:59.940
- England.

53:59.942 --> 54:01.940
- London.
- Why you so smart?

54:01.942 --> 54:03.940
You're a smart ass, eh? Eh?

54:03.942 --> 54:06.608
You're a smart ass, eh, boy?

54:17.692 --> 54:20.192
Step out of the car.

54:25.608 --> 54:26.692
You were speeding.

54:27.942 --> 54:31.940
- So?
- I want your licence and registration...

54:37.608 --> 54:39.773
Shut up! Shut up!

54:39.775 --> 54:43.606
Yeah, big drug dealer.

54:43.608 --> 54:46.192
Land Rover, Jaguar.

55:00.108 --> 55:02.025
I feel like you ate a bombaclart still.

55:02.692 --> 55:06.023
Yo, follow.

55:13.400 --> 55:15.442
All right, Mr Sour Sap.

55:25.900 --> 55:27.065
Sour Sap.

55:27.067 --> 55:29.940
We'll finger Peaches in a few days, sir.

55:29.942 --> 55:33.731
Just gonna chill out
and fuck some Jamaican pussy.

55:33.733 --> 55:36.315
- You ever fucked pussy in Jamaica?
- No.

55:36.317 --> 55:37.773
- Never thought about it?
- No.

55:37.775 --> 55:40.190
Ask him.

55:41.358 --> 55:43.898
I have a place name, back road.

55:43.900 --> 55:47.106
2,000 dollar.

55:47.108 --> 55:50.940
Get your whistle washed cos....

55:50.942 --> 55:53.690
He's a regular. Very often.

55:53.692 --> 55:56.565
Yeah. Take my advice, man.

55:56.567 --> 55:57.942
- He knew it all.
- All right.

56:05.358 --> 56:07.692
Big up, everybody coming out tonight.

56:09.025 --> 56:10.025
Celebrate.

56:11.150 --> 56:14.565
The great Peaches' birthday. Peaches.

56:14.567 --> 56:17.025
We have something special for you tonight.

57:06.025 --> 57:08.525
- Wagwan, Sour Sap?
- I do good.

57:09.733 --> 57:10.900
I was thinking, still.

57:13.025 --> 57:16.400
Bev... Is that your real sister?

57:17.358 --> 57:19.565
Yeah, man, she my family, wagwan?

57:19.567 --> 57:22.317
She a blood family, is what I'm saying.

57:23.233 --> 57:24.565
Yeah, wagwan?

57:33.525 --> 57:36.358
I was thinking, me and you
could be like family, still.

57:37.858 --> 57:39.567
They have to prove theirself.

57:41.358 --> 57:43.275
For instance, the deal you got with Bev.

57:44.358 --> 57:45.942
It's you taking the risk.

57:47.567 --> 57:49.442
You sourcing all the food.

57:50.817 --> 57:54.775
And all she doing is getting me and my
brothers to distribute it, and for what?

57:58.358 --> 57:59.731
So what do you have?

57:59.733 --> 58:01.442
Me and you can do some business.

58:05.233 --> 58:07.733
So about your people. G.

58:09.525 --> 58:11.856
Let me worry about G.

58:15.400 --> 58:20.358
Just remember this, man,
I was once ambitious like you.

59:46.692 --> 59:48.273
You owe me, you know.

59:48.275 --> 59:50.273
Owe you for some carpet burn.

59:50.275 --> 59:52.398
Man up,
you're meant to be a bad man, blood.

59:52.400 --> 59:55.858
- I nearly got shot, innit.
- Key word in the whole sentence, "nearly".

59:57.233 --> 59:58.567
On a serious note...

01:00:01.358 --> 01:00:03.606
...I need you to drop someone for me.

01:00:03.608 --> 01:00:05.108
Drop as in how?

01:00:06.483 --> 01:00:08.523
Come on, blood, you know what I mean.

01:00:08.525 --> 01:00:11.065
So you want me
to kill somebody?

01:00:11.067 --> 01:00:12.567
Dead serious.

01:00:17.275 --> 01:00:18.317
Who?

01:00:20.108 --> 01:00:22.275
- The General.
- Sour Sap?

01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:27.398
Boy, you know the man's ruthless.
International.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.940
Kill your momma and your poppa.

01:00:28.942 --> 01:00:32.023
You're dealing with a chess player,
let me worry about all that shit.

01:00:32.025 --> 01:00:33.108
You don't even know.

01:00:34.483 --> 01:00:35.773
I ain't interested.

01:00:35.775 --> 01:00:41.275
Listen, I've got something nice for you
lined up. Deal with that thought.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:44.275
Or at least sleep on it.

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:49.942
Do you know what?
Forget I ever said anything.

01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:05.067
Yo, General, wagwan?

01:01:06.608 --> 01:01:09.190
We good?

01:01:09.192 --> 01:01:10.192
Mm-hmm.

01:01:12.067 --> 01:01:13.400
Minding my daily.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:21.567
I just wanted to see if...
You know, the other night was a bit shit.

01:01:28.483 --> 01:01:30.483
If that were my family, you know.

01:01:31.567 --> 01:01:34.815
You're automatically a part of my life,
so...

01:01:34.817 --> 01:01:37.817
- Listen...
- That way I get what I deserve.

01:01:39.317 --> 01:01:41.567
- You see the ting that I had last night.
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:43.442 --> 01:01:45.483
She was doing some pillow talking still.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:51.065
It turns out Romey and Peaches
are doing a little ting, still,

01:01:51.067 --> 01:01:52.648
I don't know if you knew about that.

01:01:52.650 --> 01:01:56.898
That's how we roll, me and Peaches.

01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:59.067
- Huh?
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:02.525 --> 01:02:05.150
You know what,
I'm gonna handle both of them for you.

01:02:10.233 --> 01:02:15.148
If Romey and Peaches are not back
by six o'clock in the morning,

01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:16.608
you are dead by seven.

01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:24.025
Cheers.

01:02:45.692 --> 01:02:47.233
No one getting Sour Sap.

01:03:00.775 --> 01:03:02.481
Me man blessed, yeah?

01:03:02.483 --> 01:03:03.900
- Wagwan?
- Wagwan?

01:03:05.192 --> 01:03:09.190
- You men know where J's at?
- That's G-Money's people, you know.

01:03:09.192 --> 01:03:10.565
Who gives a fuck?

01:03:10.567 --> 01:03:13.648
If you mind the shock,
I'll get one of my other boys to do it.

01:03:16.608 --> 01:03:18.648
- Shock.
- Man said "shock".

01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:20.358
You know what we're about, Mus.

01:03:23.858 --> 01:03:26.148
- <i>Yo, brother.</i>
- <i>Yo, yo.</i>

01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:29.690
Wagwan? Listen,
remember that thing we talked about?

01:03:29.692 --> 01:03:31.440
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Yeah?

01:03:31.442 --> 01:03:34.523
Time is of the essence. What you saying?

01:03:34.525 --> 01:03:37.317
- <i>We had this conversation already.</i>
- Yeah?

01:03:38.525 --> 01:03:41.940
Brother, listen, you ain't gonna
get caught, fam, it's in and out.

01:03:41.942 --> 01:03:44.692
You do your ting, you go home. Simple as.

01:03:48.025 --> 01:03:49.315
<i>What time?</i>

01:03:49.317 --> 01:03:52.315
Right, I'm gonna send you all the details
you need, yeah?

01:03:52.317 --> 01:03:53.900
Look out for that. I'll shout you.

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:59.523
- Ha!
- We never said queen's a slag.

01:03:59.525 --> 01:04:02.273
- You're always cheating, Jem.
- I'm not.

01:04:02.275 --> 01:04:04.398
You're just pissed
because I've won three times.

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.356
Pack it in.

01:04:06.358 --> 01:04:07.525
Jem, get the door.

01:04:08.442 --> 01:04:12.025
- Why do I always have to get the door?
- Because you're the youngest.

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:14.606
Baby!

01:04:14.608 --> 01:04:16.608
You're so funny.

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:23.775
- Jem?
- Jem?

01:04:25.233 --> 01:04:27.190
Jem?

01:04:27.192 --> 01:04:28.567
What's going on? Hmm?

01:04:30.525 --> 01:04:32.315
I got no fucking money!

01:04:32.317 --> 01:04:34.273
- Where's the fucking money?
- Harmony!

01:04:36.525 --> 01:04:39.898
I haven't got any cash here,
I haven't got any cash here!

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:41.733
Sis! Sis!

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:44.317

01:04:46.692 --> 01:04:49.273
Fuck your sis. Where's the money?

01:04:49.275 --> 01:04:52.231
Fuck your sis. Where's the fucking money?

01:04:52.233 --> 01:04:53.525
Oi, stay there.

01:04:57.108 --> 01:04:58.733
Hm? Where's the money?

01:05:00.483 --> 01:05:01.650
Get over there.

01:05:05.442 --> 01:05:07.650
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi.

01:05:08.692 --> 01:05:09.692

Hey, D. Hey, D, D, D, D, look at this.

01:05:18.733 --> 01:05:20.523
Gunman.

01:05:20.525 --> 01:05:22.190
Bust your gun then.

01:05:22.192 --> 01:05:23.815
- Shoot me then.
- Fucking let her go.

01:05:23.817 --> 01:05:26.065
Go on. Shoot me.

01:05:26.067 --> 01:05:27.815
What the fucking good are you?

01:05:27.817 --> 01:05:30.190
Get on the fucking floor,

01:05:30.192 --> 01:05:32.273
Fuck you, man.

01:05:32.275 --> 01:05:35.356
- Let him pull a gun on you, man?
- You dickhead, man.

01:05:35.358 --> 01:05:37.065
What the fuck, man?

01:05:37.067 --> 01:05:39.106
You're not even like that man,
look at you.

01:05:39.108 --> 01:05:41.233
What you saying, you're a gang man now,
yeah?

01:05:41.817 --> 01:05:45.731
- Hey, get off of him!
- Don't fucking pull your gun on me, man.

01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:49.898
- Stay over there, man.
- Fucking pull a gun on me.

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:52.400
Fucking dick! Fucking dickhead!

01:06:06.442 --> 01:06:08.067
No, I true am in love with you, boy.

01:06:11.275 --> 01:06:13.858
I really like the way you made me feel
at the party.

01:06:14.775 --> 01:06:16.275
How me make you feel?

01:06:17.233 --> 01:06:19.773
You know Sour, a pretty white ting.

01:06:38.775 --> 01:06:40.983
- So you're home tonight?
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:42.692 --> 01:06:44.150
Sour's your ex.

01:06:45.483 --> 01:06:48.065
- Sour Sap ain't an idiot.
- Sour pussy.

01:06:57.608 --> 01:06:58.983
- Come!
- Go, go.

01:07:14.942 --> 01:07:17.273
Hey, what's up, pussy boy?

01:07:27.442 --> 01:07:28.608
Peaches...

01:07:29.608 --> 01:07:32.317
Not yet ripe enough for the sinner, huh?

01:07:38.317 --> 01:07:40.358
Yo! G-Money!

01:07:42.483 --> 01:07:44.775
I can smell your stinking fam
from here.

01:07:45.775 --> 01:07:48.273
I bet you go back to England in a box.

01:07:48.275 --> 01:07:49.898
How much you want to bet me?

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:53.315
Eh? Show your face, pussy.
Show your face.

01:07:53.317 --> 01:07:55.108
Show you about bad boy.

01:07:56.192 --> 01:07:57.731
Who's hiding?

01:07:57.733 --> 01:08:01.442
Talk too much, that's why tonight, you get
a bullet in your little pissing mouth.

01:08:40.942 --> 01:08:42.483
Back up, back up, back up!

01:09:02.608 --> 01:09:05.274
Stupid sket.

01:09:29.358 --> 01:09:30.567
What happened?

01:09:33.442 --> 01:09:36.898
We have a bloodclart dead police officer.

01:09:36.899 --> 01:09:39.939
Where's Sour Sap's body then?

01:09:49.483 --> 01:09:53.564
Kingsley, let me speak to you.
You and your men had one task.

01:09:53.567 --> 01:09:55.940
- Shut up!
- One task.

01:09:55.942 --> 01:09:57.606
Don't point that thing at me.

01:09:57.608 --> 01:10:02.523
You do that one more time,
I'll murder you like that dead officer.

01:10:02.525 --> 01:10:05.690
I will kill you and send your body back
to England.

01:10:05.692 --> 01:10:09.106
You had one task, which you failed.

01:10:09.108 --> 01:10:11.648
Don't you ever come to my island

01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:14.731
and disrespect none of my officers
down here.

01:10:14.733 --> 01:10:22.233
We solve crime, don't you bloodclart
disrespect my officers, don't!

01:10:23.192 --> 01:10:25.942
- Don't fucking...
- Find Sour Sap!

01:10:43.067 --> 01:10:47.440
Shit, Mitch has been shot! You, man!
Quick, Mitch, get up, man!

01:10:47.442 --> 01:10:49.315
- Come on, man.
- Who the fuck shot you?

01:10:49.317 --> 01:10:51.815
- A fucking pussy...
- Hold your gun, hold your gun.

01:10:51.817 --> 01:10:53.731
- Stand up!
- What the fuck, man?

01:10:53.733 --> 01:10:55.481
- Fucking hell.
- Come on.

01:10:55.483 --> 01:10:57.440
Where'd you get shot,
in your arm or your leg?

01:10:57.442 --> 01:10:58.733
Walk, man, man up.

01:11:05.317 --> 01:11:06.317
No mercy!

01:11:07.442 --> 01:11:08.981
No mercy!

01:11:15.983 --> 01:11:17.150
No mercy!

01:11:18.650 --> 01:11:20.358
Come to the boot, come to the boot.

01:11:21.858 --> 01:11:25.608
I'm sick of them fuckers.

01:11:29.525 --> 01:11:30.733
Come, Mitch, man, hurry up.

01:11:52.942 --> 01:11:56.606
- Shit.
- Mitch, you're good, blood, you're good.

01:11:56.608 --> 01:12:00.023
God, please,
deliver me from this situation.

01:12:00.025 --> 01:12:03.150
- Mitch, stop chatting shit!
- Shut up, man, I'm talking to God!

01:12:25.233 --> 01:12:28.856
Roll me, fam.
Fucking beating Sour Sap's ting.

01:12:28.858 --> 01:12:32.606
- Taking the pick, boy. She's nice though.
- She's fire, fam.

01:12:32.608 --> 01:12:35.815
- She's fire, fam.
- I might have done her dance as well.

01:12:35.817 --> 01:12:39.231
Bruv, she's fire. Bruv, you.

01:12:39.233 --> 01:12:40.940
- I had to, bruv.
- Fam.

01:12:40.942 --> 01:12:43.856
She pulled the ting out on me, bruv.
I wasn't sure if I was gonna fuck her

01:12:43.858 --> 01:12:46.815
or dock her after this.
Fucking flick her down, blood.

01:12:46.817 --> 01:12:49.275
You're mad jokes, you know.

01:13:20.067 --> 01:13:21.525
You, man, hurry up!

01:13:54.692 --> 01:13:55.692
Chill out.

01:13:56.733 --> 01:13:57.733
Chill out.

01:14:05.733 --> 01:14:08.106
- I'm not gonna beg for my life.
- Yes, you are.

01:14:08.108 --> 01:14:09.108
Hear me out.

01:14:11.150 --> 01:14:12.150
G.

01:14:13.692 --> 01:14:14.692
Just hear me out.

01:14:18.733 --> 01:14:22.942
Sour Sap's whole operation is done.

01:14:25.358 --> 01:14:26.358
You hear me?

01:14:27.317 --> 01:14:28.442
It's done, G!

01:14:29.650 --> 01:14:33.358
Beverley's whole operation
is finished, dog.

01:14:35.608 --> 01:14:36.692
We can still...

01:14:38.942 --> 01:14:42.275
- We can still do this ting together, bro.
- Who the fuck's "we"?

01:14:45.942 --> 01:14:48.108
G... just hear me out.

01:14:51.150 --> 01:14:53.442
I've got all of Sour Sap's contacts.

01:14:54.483 --> 01:14:57.648
I've got all of his links.
We can still... Bro...

01:14:57.650 --> 01:15:01.731
I'm tired of
these fucking Yardies anyway.

01:15:01.733 --> 01:15:05.440
We're all from the ends, dog.
Yeah?

01:15:05.442 --> 01:15:06.525
Shut the fuck up.

01:15:09.525 --> 01:15:10.525
G.

01:15:18.567 --> 01:15:20.315
Put your guns on the ground, yeah?

01:15:20.317 --> 01:15:21.523
G, what you doing?

01:15:21.525 --> 01:15:24.775
- Put your guns on the ground.
- G, what you doing, blood?

01:15:34.358 --> 01:15:35.358
Hurry up.

01:15:40.525 --> 01:15:42.648
Beverley sent us out here for?

01:15:42.650 --> 01:15:44.731
To kill a rat,
and that's what we're doing.

01:15:44.733 --> 01:15:45.733
Yeah?

01:15:48.525 --> 01:15:51.606
You forget to say,
my cousins, they roll with Mustafa.

01:15:51.608 --> 01:15:52.690
And your point is?

01:15:52.692 --> 01:15:55.148
You think I don't know everything
you're dealing with?

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:57.273
Anything I'm doing is for us, G!

01:15:57.275 --> 01:15:58.900
Don't listen to this pagan, G.

01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:07.565
For us. Running around town,
mashing works for peanuts.

01:16:07.567 --> 01:16:10.148
Boy, you're running round town
doing tings behind my back.

01:16:10.150 --> 01:16:12.606
- For us, G!
- Lower your tone when you're talking,

01:16:12.608 --> 01:16:15.067
- what's wrong with you?
- Yeah, pussy.

01:16:21.150 --> 01:16:22.775
That's how we deal with the snakes.

01:16:24.608 --> 01:16:26.358
Careful how you're moving things.

01:16:34.733 --> 01:16:36.400
Pick up your guns, man, let's go.

01:16:40.608 --> 01:16:42.192
Pick up your guns, let's go.

01:17:03.025 --> 01:17:04.356
Yo!

01:17:04.358 --> 01:17:05.773
- Come on, man.
- General.

01:17:05.775 --> 01:17:09.023
Careful, bro, careful, man!
Fuck's sake, man.

01:17:09.025 --> 01:17:10.648
- Sit down.
- Bro, just...

01:17:10.650 --> 01:17:13.398
Yo, General! Where the fuck's everyone?

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.858
Let me check out the back, man.

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:19.525
- You good?
- Yeah, man.

01:17:21.858 --> 01:17:22.858
Yeah.

01:17:27.525 --> 01:17:30.481
- It's empty, man.
- I know, I know, relax, man, relax.

01:17:30.483 --> 01:17:31.525
Let's blow, man.

01:17:33.108 --> 01:17:36.065
- Where's General? Where's Sour Sap?
- Yo, chill.

01:17:36.067 --> 01:17:37.940
That's what I'm saying,
no one is here, bruv.

01:17:37.942 --> 01:17:39.983
We chill till the morning, yeah?

01:17:42.358 --> 01:17:44.815
The General don't come by morning,
we cut.

01:17:44.817 --> 01:17:46.398
Them Yardies are booky, blood.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.315
This ain't our place,
what you talking about?

01:17:48.317 --> 01:17:50.565
Where's Sour Sap? Where are they?

01:17:50.567 --> 01:17:52.983
- Place is empty, blood.
- What am I meant to do?

01:17:59.233 --> 01:18:00.358
Yo, J?

01:18:01.817 --> 01:18:03.733
Right now, they're our options.

01:18:06.150 --> 01:18:08.025
Sounds like the best plan to me.

01:18:09.192 --> 01:18:11.481
You, man, have gone mad.

01:18:11.483 --> 01:18:13.108
We men are the bosses, innit.

01:18:22.233 --> 01:18:23.315
<i>Ma'am.</i>

01:18:23.317 --> 01:18:26.648
If we leave them long enough,
they're bound to give in.

01:18:26.650 --> 01:18:30.523
<i>Unless your hunch
forms a legal basis for detention,</i>

01:18:30.525 --> 01:18:33.106
<i>we have to let them go.</i>

01:18:33.108 --> 01:18:37.773
<i>Goodness, this is proving to be
a very expensive joke.</i>

01:18:37.775 --> 01:18:40.525
Ma'am, they're running a tight operation
here in Jamaica.

01:18:44.233 --> 01:18:50.565
If you leave, I will solve the case.
But I really don't want you to.

01:18:50.567 --> 01:18:53.315
But we got to get this guy, man,
we have to get the boy.

01:18:53.317 --> 01:18:58.108
We have to get him
as every last rough club wanna bet.

01:19:22.233 --> 01:19:24.231
Sir, I'm looking for Selene Abraham.

01:19:24.233 --> 01:19:26.858
- Er, she's right in there.
- Thank you.

01:19:44.567 --> 01:19:45.900
Can I get a minute, please?

01:19:49.317 --> 01:19:50.317
It's fine.

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:01.608
- What do you want?
- How you feeling?

01:20:04.275 --> 01:20:06.233
What do you mean, how am I feeling?

01:20:06.775 --> 01:20:09.023
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

01:20:09.025 --> 01:20:12.690
What? Is that all you've got to say?

01:20:12.692 --> 01:20:15.398
You know my job comes with hazards,
Selene.

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:16.650
Are you kidding me?

01:20:17.608 --> 01:20:21.067
J, we've just lost our baby
and you're talking about fucking hazards.

01:20:22.067 --> 01:20:25.358
- I never meant it like that.
- J, we lost our baby.

01:20:28.817 --> 01:20:30.067
Get off me.

01:20:39.608 --> 01:20:40.942
G, I've been thinking.

01:20:43.525 --> 01:20:46.358
- I'm out.
- What do you mean, you're out?

01:20:55.108 --> 01:20:56.690
I got children, man.

01:20:56.692 --> 01:21:01.981
Hold on. A man just lost his fucking baby
and you're talking about you got children.

01:21:01.983 --> 01:21:03.940
Are you hearing yourself, bro?

01:21:03.942 --> 01:21:06.481
Bro, answer me this,
what are you gonna do?

01:21:06.483 --> 01:21:08.940
I've been speaking to my pastor, you know.

01:21:08.942 --> 01:21:10.108
You been... Mm.

01:21:11.067 --> 01:21:13.148
You been speaking to your pastor, yeah?

01:21:13.150 --> 01:21:16.606
You been speaking to your pastor?
So, tell me, what's your pastor saying?

01:21:16.608 --> 01:21:19.648
I'm gonna focus on church
and getting a job, bro.

01:21:19.650 --> 01:21:21.815
What are you gonna write
on your application?

01:21:21.817 --> 01:21:24.898
What you gonna do on your CV?
You gonna say, "I got previous history

01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:28.815
in doing a bit of robbery
and selling some drugs"? Are you mad?

01:21:28.817 --> 01:21:31.523
- Jesus my vibe, man.
- You know what, fuck off.

01:21:31.525 --> 01:21:34.273
You see when it gets on top for you?
See when it gets on top for you

01:21:34.275 --> 01:21:36.940
like it did when your babymother
starts getting in your ears,

01:21:36.942 --> 01:21:39.231
talking about she needs money
for fucking petrol,

01:21:39.233 --> 01:21:42.356
and you can't even get your daughter
a birthday present or a party.

01:21:42.358 --> 01:21:44.440
Don't come back around here,
and remember,

01:21:44.442 --> 01:21:47.856
when your friend fucking needed you,
you was too busy talking to your pastor

01:21:47.858 --> 01:21:50.400
about I need money and I need a job.
Fuck off, man.

01:21:52.942 --> 01:21:54.150
Dickhead, Mitch.

01:21:55.067 --> 01:21:57.398
This guy's a dickhead, man.

01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:58.898
Taking the piss, man.

01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:00.940
Come out of there, man.

01:22:44.608 --> 01:22:46.565
- Wagwan, my brother?
- Wagwan?

01:22:46.567 --> 01:22:48.273
You need my goods, yeah?

01:22:48.275 --> 01:22:49.650
You got them tings, yeah?

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:55.398
You say more machines
and no bodies ain't dropping.

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:56.815
It's fucking mealy, fam.

01:22:56.817 --> 01:22:59.315
Don't worry, man,
I'm gonna lick some later on tonight.

01:22:59.317 --> 01:23:02.648
Better do that. Tell Bev
that's an extra five racks as well,

01:23:02.650 --> 01:23:05.148
cos those were meant to go
to the Russians.

01:23:05.150 --> 01:23:08.523
- Five rack, G-Man like that?
- Yeah, fam, take...

01:23:08.525 --> 01:23:10.731
- What's wrong with this?
- Get the fuck off, man.

01:23:10.733 --> 01:23:13.190
- You drive that, man?
- Get off that, you prick,

01:23:13.192 --> 01:23:14.898
before I strangle you, man.

01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:16.481
Wagwan, man?

01:23:16.483 --> 01:23:19.856
Are you meant to be a killer
or fucking worrying about grills?

01:23:19.858 --> 01:23:21.817
Go catch a buddy or something, nigga.

01:23:25.858 --> 01:23:29.231
When I was in Jam,
you know Beverley's brother, Sour Sap?

01:23:29.233 --> 01:23:32.898
- Sour Sap, ain't that a fruit?
- Obviously, it's a fruit,

01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:35.898
but Bev's brother's nickname
is Sour Sap as well, bruv.

01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:38.815
Come on. Stop acting like
you don't know what I'm talking about.

01:23:38.817 --> 01:23:40.317
You're acting stupid right now.

01:23:41.317 --> 01:23:43.273
What did we go Jamaica for?
To put in work.

01:23:43.275 --> 01:23:45.523
Who for? Bev and Sour Sap.
Come on, bro.

01:23:45.525 --> 01:23:49.440
- Yeah, you drink Sour Sap.
- Obviously, I drink a lot of Sour Sap.

01:23:49.442 --> 01:23:52.773
What? You's drinking Sour Sap?

01:23:52.775 --> 01:23:54.690
- Bruv, are you stupid?
- Oh, my days.

01:23:54.692 --> 01:23:59.231
Sour Sap the fruit, not Sour Sap the man,
you dickhead.

01:23:59.233 --> 01:24:02.148
You're a dodgy guy, bruv,
been drinking a man called Sour Sap.

01:24:02.150 --> 01:24:04.856
- What were you lot doing, bruv?
- You're so stupid.

01:24:04.858 --> 01:24:07.273
- I'm telling the mandem about this.
- What are you talking about?

01:24:07.275 --> 01:24:10.523
All the mandem were drinking Sour Sap.
It's a juice, fam.

01:24:10.525 --> 01:24:14.065
It's a good juice, it makes you strong.

01:24:14.067 --> 01:24:16.317
You were drinking Sour Sap.

01:24:18.025 --> 01:24:20.233
You're not serious, fam,
you're stupid, you know.

01:24:22.067 --> 01:24:25.523
- I swear that car is following us.
- What car, man? Just drive.

01:24:25.525 --> 01:24:27.398
Focus on the road, bruv.

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.940
Let me build you a spliff, bro.
You're pissing me off.

01:24:29.942 --> 01:24:32.898
Well, every time I turn left,
it turns left.

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:35.148
- Must be feds.
- You're paranoid.

01:24:35.150 --> 01:24:36.898
Go left, man.

01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:40.648
- Told you it's the feds, bro, I told you.
- Drive, drive, drive! Drive, drive, drive!

01:24:40.650 --> 01:24:43.483
- Shut up!
- Don't fucking tell me to shut up!

01:24:59.233 --> 01:25:00.233
Shane!

01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:02.983
Shane!

01:25:04.025 --> 01:25:05.192
Shane!

01:25:29.817 --> 01:25:32.358
I'm so sorry for your loss, son.

01:25:34.733 --> 01:25:37.108
What them boys did was fuckery.

01:25:40.817 --> 01:25:41.817
Come.

01:25:53.358 --> 01:25:57.067
I seen you and G-Money
grow from wise to men.

01:26:00.192 --> 01:26:02.733
I've been doing your mum's hair
for 20-something years.

01:26:04.525 --> 01:26:05.775
Right there.

01:26:06.858 --> 01:26:08.192
I'm not gonna lie to you.

01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:12.650
Out of you and G-Money...

01:26:15.525 --> 01:26:16.942
...you're my favourite.

01:26:18.608 --> 01:26:19.942
Yeah, he's my foster son.

01:26:22.733 --> 01:26:25.108
But you're like a real son to me.

01:26:26.567 --> 01:26:28.483
Is that why you killed my unborn child?

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:32.400
Me?

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:36.400
Never.

01:26:40.067 --> 01:26:43.565
And just the other day I was giving
D'Angel and Shane those machines

01:26:43.567 --> 01:26:46.275
to go and hit them dirty Turks back.

01:26:51.733 --> 01:26:52.942
Come on now, man.

01:26:54.692 --> 01:26:56.648
I gonna fix this.

01:26:56.650 --> 01:26:58.358
You know I will.

01:27:02.275 --> 01:27:03.275
It's all right.

01:27:05.317 --> 01:27:07.275
Gonna fix this, darling, don't worry.

01:27:09.108 --> 01:27:10.150
Fix it.

01:27:26.192 --> 01:27:28.856
- Wait here and watch the camera.
- What?

01:27:28.858 --> 01:27:32.065
You heard me, wait here
and fucking watch the camera!

01:27:32.067 --> 01:27:33.858
Fuck off, Smith!

01:28:11.650 --> 01:28:14.025
Come on, let's clean this shit up.

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:21.856
My turn. Let's go and do this,

01:28:21.858 --> 01:28:24.690
let's go and ride out on these Turks,
bruv.

01:28:24.692 --> 01:28:25.692
Trust me.

01:28:26.733 --> 01:28:28.856
Good to have you back, bro.

01:28:28.858 --> 01:28:31.690
- Wagwan?
- Is that G? Wagwan, brother?

01:28:31.692 --> 01:28:34.315
You ready to go ride out on these Turks,
man?

01:28:34.317 --> 01:28:37.692
Bro, you're good. We ain't gotta
do nothing if you ain't ready, you know.

01:28:41.692 --> 01:28:43.773
- Bev's dead.
- What?

01:28:43.775 --> 01:28:44.898
What?

01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:47.315
- Man said, "Bev's dead."
- What do you mean, Bev's dead?

01:28:47.317 --> 01:28:50.481
Don't joke like that.
Bev ain't dead, man, what's the matter?

01:28:50.483 --> 01:28:51.525
What's wrong?

01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:55.648
I walked past her shop and
they was carrying her body out in a bag.

01:28:57.900 --> 01:28:59.690
- What?
- Nah, nah, nah.

01:28:59.692 --> 01:29:00.692
He's chatting shit.

01:29:01.733 --> 01:29:05.606
Bro, don't joke like that. Bev ain't dead,
bruv, what you talking about?

01:29:05.608 --> 01:29:09.023
This is what I mean, I've had enough.
It's time to go ride on these Turks.

01:29:09.025 --> 01:29:11.148
- Fucking Turks!
- Time, blood.

01:29:13.317 --> 01:29:15.108
First your baby and now Bev?

01:29:17.442 --> 01:29:21.231
To fuck with the chatty-chatty ting.
We've got the machines coming right now.

01:29:30.275 --> 01:29:32.690
Are you ready? J?

01:29:32.692 --> 01:29:34.150
Let's go, we got shit to do, man.

01:29:59.442 --> 01:30:01.317
Just saying, Bonesy, live, yeah?

01:30:02.567 --> 01:30:04.525
OK.

01:30:47.067 --> 01:30:49.900
I've been here for six hours, fam.
No-one's come in or out.

01:30:51.525 --> 01:30:52.773
Mm.

01:30:52.775 --> 01:30:56.815
- You sure this is Mus's spot?
- I told you, he owns this spot.

01:30:56.817 --> 01:30:59.231
Brother, why you in this big white thing
anyway?

01:30:59.233 --> 01:31:01.233
- Why, where's your car?
- Back here.

01:31:03.067 --> 01:31:04.400
A'ight, let's go in your ting.

01:31:05.567 --> 01:31:06.692
Blacks, let's roll.

01:31:14.317 --> 01:31:16.731
- Where you goin'?
- What do you know, where am I going?

01:31:16.733 --> 01:31:18.856
- Come in the back, man.
- It's my car, bruv.

01:31:18.858 --> 01:31:22.065
In the car, mate. In the back, brother.

01:31:22.067 --> 01:31:24.523
Come on. Come on, com on.

01:31:24.525 --> 01:31:27.400
- Come on, jump in, man.
- Come on, get in the back.

01:31:39.942 --> 01:31:41.150
J, you're good, yeah?

01:31:43.192 --> 01:31:45.733
Yeah, I'm just thinking about Bev
and my unborn.

01:31:46.692 --> 01:31:49.106
You know what, to hell with that.
What you see right now,

01:31:49.108 --> 01:31:50.648
it's serious times right here.

01:31:50.650 --> 01:31:52.731
Can't have you fleeking out on us,
brother.

01:31:52.733 --> 01:31:55.648
- You're a talker.
- Fleeking, brother.

01:31:55.650 --> 01:31:58.025
Wanna compare resumes?

01:32:00.942 --> 01:32:04.273
- Yo, baby.
- Some guy is literally shutting it down.

01:32:04.275 --> 01:32:06.981
- Who's on the phone?
- Shut up, man.

01:32:06.983 --> 01:32:11.231
I think his name's, like, Muf...
Mus... Mustafa.

01:32:11.233 --> 01:32:12.233
What?

01:32:13.525 --> 01:32:14.898
Mustafa?

01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:17.231
The one that owns the shisha spot?

01:32:17.233 --> 01:32:18.898
Send me a picture, right now.

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:21.481
<i>All right, I'll send one now. Bye.</i>

01:32:21.483 --> 01:32:22.483
All right.

01:32:39.442 --> 01:32:42.190
- Wagwan, babe, where's this Mustafa?
- I don't know.

01:32:42.192 --> 01:32:44.231
What do you mean?
You told me my man's there,

01:32:44.233 --> 01:32:46.315
- now you're telling me you don't know.
- Hey, bro!

01:32:46.317 --> 01:32:49.190
- Is she wasting my time or something?
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:32:49.192 --> 01:32:50.523
It's a fucking joke ting.

01:32:50.525 --> 01:32:53.731
- Babe, come, I need you...
- Fuck off, Sarah.

01:32:53.733 --> 01:32:56.440
- What are you doing, you waste man?
- Shut up.

01:32:56.442 --> 01:32:58.106
- Dickhead!
- Waste man.

01:32:58.108 --> 01:33:00.483
You look like you come from Mars, blood.

01:33:03.817 --> 01:33:06.440
Hear what I'm saying,
it's five in the morning, fam.

01:33:06.442 --> 01:33:09.315
The girls have seen us,
people have walked past the car.

01:33:09.317 --> 01:33:11.398
Don't make no sense, fam.
We're overforcing it.

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.440
We're gonna go to jail like this, fam.

01:33:13.442 --> 01:33:16.106
I didn't bring my machine out tonight
for nothing.

01:33:16.108 --> 01:33:18.356
- Man, I know.
- I ain't sleeping.

01:33:18.358 --> 01:33:21.731
But all I'm saying to you
is it's bait now, it's bait.

01:33:21.733 --> 01:33:24.940
We're forcing it.
This is how man go to jail, blood.

01:33:24.942 --> 01:33:27.606
Look, people walking past us now,
they can see in the car,

01:33:27.608 --> 01:33:30.317
we've argued with the girls.
Let's just do it tomorrow.

01:33:33.942 --> 01:33:35.483
Comes circle, innit.

01:33:36.650 --> 01:33:40.231
A man's gonna come out the rave,
he's gonna need to get food, yeah?

01:33:40.233 --> 01:33:43.481
- Grab food.
- That makes more sense, man.

01:33:43.483 --> 01:33:47.442
- Auto car. This is just a joke ting, fam.
- I ain't sleeping, bro.

01:33:49.775 --> 01:33:53.483
Blue needs to shut his mouth
or I'll throw him in the boot, fam.

01:34:01.650 --> 01:34:03.067
Hands on my munch.

01:34:06.275 --> 01:34:07.275
See a cab?

01:34:09.733 --> 01:34:11.817
Man, no smoking fag.

01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:14.608
- Sure that's my man, there.
- Where?

01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:17.025
Hey, pull up outside, G.

01:34:18.358 --> 01:34:20.648
- Mustafa!
- Oh, shit.

01:34:39.525 --> 01:34:40.858
Hey, Mustafa?

01:34:41.775 --> 01:34:42.775
Huh?

01:34:57.192 --> 01:34:58.233
Fuck's sake.

01:35:14.983 --> 01:35:16.858
Fuck!

01:35:27.567 --> 01:35:30.523
You ain't even looking in my eye, blood.
Go on.

01:35:30.525 --> 01:35:32.898
You don't need to find me
if you're not looking after me.

01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:35.398
You know I'm gonna be looking after you,
that's not a problem.

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:38.565
- Really?
- Where's the fucking exit? Huh?

01:35:40.817 --> 01:35:45.231
- Why the fuck would I pay you, huh?
- Fucking snake!

01:35:45.233 --> 01:35:48.108
- Get the fuck out of here now!
- Let go of me.

01:36:03.567 --> 01:36:05.442
Are you out, yeah? Pussies.

01:36:07.192 --> 01:36:08.317
Oh, shit.

01:36:11.025 --> 01:36:12.358
Fuck.

01:36:14.442 --> 01:36:17.606
Shove me your G,

01:36:17.608 --> 01:36:19.733
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

01:36:39.608 --> 01:36:41.065
J!

01:36:41.067 --> 01:36:43.442
Hey, J, we got the pussy all cornered.

01:36:48.317 --> 01:36:49.983
- Ah!

01:36:51.608 --> 01:36:53.315
You, man.

01:36:53.317 --> 01:36:54.606
Shit!

You, man. You, man.

01:36:56.358 --> 01:36:58.606
Get me out of here, cuz,
you gotta get me out of here now.

01:36:58.608 --> 01:36:59.898
I've run out of bullets.

01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:04.106
- I pay you enough money, man.
- Who the fuck you talking to like that?

01:37:04.108 --> 01:37:05.606
- Walk, man, dickhead.
- What?

01:37:05.608 --> 01:37:08.273
I've had enough of you, man,
walk, rude boy.

01:37:08.275 --> 01:37:10.231
- Yeah?
- All right. That's what it is, yeah?

01:37:10.233 --> 01:37:13.400
- That's what it is, bro.
- You're gonna regret this, you know.

01:37:15.525 --> 01:37:16.900
Mustafa.

01:37:21.150 --> 01:37:22.233
Go down there, man.

01:37:26.442 --> 01:37:28.108
You know they're my family, bro.

01:37:30.025 --> 01:37:33.317
G, man, you're busting it, man.
What's that about, man?

01:37:34.275 --> 01:37:35.650
Trying to catch this snake.

01:37:37.192 --> 01:37:40.315
Oi, J? Raise your arm and bang him!

01:37:40.317 --> 01:37:42.606
- Nah, J, you don't wanna do that, man.
- J!

01:37:42.608 --> 01:37:47.148
Look at the plans we had together, cuz,
we coulda been running London together.

01:37:47.150 --> 01:37:49.817
You wanna know about your uncle?
Let me tell you about...

01:37:50.275 --> 01:37:52.483
You're talking too much, man.

01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:00.942
Gimme your gun.

01:38:03.817 --> 01:38:07.483
I can't look at you, man. Gimme your gun.
They're gonna carry you out.

01:38:14.317 --> 01:38:16.733
Bro, gimme your gun, you got him.

01:38:18.942 --> 01:38:21.317
Gimme your gun, bro, don't you trust me?

01:38:41.317 --> 01:38:42.275
It's time, bro.

01:38:44.442 --> 01:38:45.775
It's funny, this moment.

01:38:48.650 --> 01:38:54.106
I remember one day, when we was kids,
you pulled out a gun on me.

01:38:54.108 --> 01:38:57.108
And my mum said,
"That boy's gonna be the death of you."

01:39:09.858 --> 01:39:13.067
You're harsh, blood.
That's why your mother left you.

01:39:15.067 --> 01:39:17.567
Went and looked after
the rest of your siblings.

01:39:44.858 --> 01:39:46.567
You should've listened to your mum.

01:39:56.233 --> 01:39:58.942
Finally.

01:40:01.942 --> 01:40:03.442
Sorry about your youth.
