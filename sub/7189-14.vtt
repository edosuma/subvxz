20:30.646 --> 20:32.606
I know.

20:36.443 --> 20:38.278
He's in a safe place.
I promise.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.030
Just--just give me the Hexoren,
and I'll take you to him.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.491
- I can't believe you did that,

20:42.574 --> 20:45.786
and now my best friend is crying
about that reptile.

20:45.869 --> 20:47.204
I should turn you
into some tissues

20:47.287 --> 20:48.747
so she can blow her nose
on you.

20:50.415 --> 20:53.835
- Let's face it.
You lost this one.

20:53.919 --> 20:57.255
I guess the Panthers aren't
as all-powerful as you thought.

20:57.339 --> 21:00.008
- You deserve to be snotted on,
so where's what I'll do.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.343
I'll turn you
into a stack of tiss--

21:01.426 --> 21:03.595
- Wait, wait, wait!
Daniel's coming.

21:03.679 --> 21:04.346
- [scoffs] Nice try.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.472
You're such a bad liar.

21:05.555 --> 21:08.225
Take some lying lessons,
for crying out loud.

21:08.308 --> 21:09.518
- Hey, guys.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.145
What are you two
doing together?

21:18.068 --> 21:19.528
- You don't have to do this.

21:19.611 --> 21:21.363
We can wait
till Maddie gets here.

21:21.446 --> 21:22.614
- It's okay.

21:22.698 --> 21:23.991
He wants to go home.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.702
- [sighs]
Mrs. Van Pelt!

21:26.785 --> 21:28.036
- Don't worry.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.330
She won't be able to undo
Maddie's spell.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.040
- Ready?

21:34.459 --> 21:34.751
Three blind mice in a--

21:34.835 --> 21:37.212
- Stop!

21:38.171 --> 21:39.798
What do you think you're doing?

21:39.881 --> 21:43.010
- It's okay.
He wants to go home.

21:43.093 --> 21:43.885
- Then I should be the one
to do it.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.429
You can't trust her.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.850
We don't want you here.
You're in the way.

21:49.933 --> 21:52.853
So I'm sending you
far, far away.
