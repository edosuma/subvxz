01:05.607 --> 01:08.985
This is a story of boy meets girl.

01:13.198 --> 01:16.743
The boy, Tom Hansen
of Margate, New Jersey,

01:16.827 --> 01:19.662
grew up believing that
he'd never truly be happy...

01:19.747 --> 01:21.873
until the day he met "the one."

01:21.957 --> 01:27.007
This belief stemmed from early
exposure to sad British pop music...

01:27.196 --> 01:29.672
and a total misreading
of the movie The Graduate.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.091
Elaine! Elaine!

01:32.176 --> 01:35.178
The girl, Summer Finn
of Shinnecock, Michigan

01:35.262 --> 01:37.513
did not share this belief.

01:37.598 --> 01:41.142
Since the disintegration
of her parents marriage

01:41.226 --> 01:43.478
she'd only loved two things.

01:43.562 --> 01:46.689
The first was her long dark hair.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.859
The second was how easily
she could cut it off...

01:49.943 --> 01:51.903
and feel nothing.

01:52.988 --> 01:56.282
Tom meets Summer on January 8.

01:56.366 --> 02:00.620
He knows almost immediately
she's who he's been searching for.

02:01.914 --> 02:05.166
This is a story of boy meets girl.

02:06.210 --> 02:08.294
But you should know up front

02:08.377 --> 02:10.378
this is not a love story.

02:16.220 --> 02:19.514
# They made a statue of us #

02:21.558 --> 02:24.936
# And put it on a mountaintop #

02:27.064 --> 02:30.566
# Now tourists come and stare at us #

02:31.902 --> 02:34.403
# Blow bubbles with their gum #

02:34.488 --> 02:36.739
# Take photographs of fun #

02:36.824 --> 02:38.783
# Have fun #

02:43.080 --> 02:46.624
# They'll name a city after us #

02:48.502 --> 02:52.380
# And later say it's all our fault #

02:54.049 --> 02:59.387
# Then they'll give us a talking to #

02:59.471 --> 03:03.558
# 'Cause they've got years of experience #

03:07.354 --> 03:10.731
# Living in a den of thieves #

03:10.816 --> 03:16.153
# Rummaging for answers in the pages #

03:18.782 --> 03:22.201
# Living in a den of thieves #

03:22.286 --> 03:30.710
# And it's contagious #

03:30.794 --> 03:33.588
# And it's contagious ##

04:20.010 --> 04:22.261
We didn't know
who else to call.

04:22.346 --> 04:24.472
It's Amanda Heller
all over again.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.515
You did the right thing.

04:27.893 --> 04:31.520
Now where is he?

04:37.277 --> 04:39.278
Thomas.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.282
Rachel.
What are you doing here?

04:43.408 --> 04:45.868
I'm here to help you.
- Help me how?

04:45.953 --> 04:48.204
First' put down the plate.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.666
Drink this.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.127
- What is that?
- Vodka.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.421
Um' does Mom know
that you're here?

04:57.547 --> 05:01.008
'Cause it's probably past 10:00.
- Don't worry about it.

05:01.093 --> 05:05.763
Just start from the beginning,
and tell us what happened.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.516
Things were going so well.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.613
Then what?

05:22.698 --> 05:24.824
I think we should
stop seeing each other.

05:24.950 --> 05:27.076
Just like that?
- Just like that.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.997
- Did she say why?
- I mean' this thing- what are we doing?

05:31.081 --> 05:33.165
I mean, is this normal?

05:33.250 --> 05:36.210
Norm- I- I don't know. I don't care.
I'm happy. Aren't you happy?

05:36.336 --> 05:38.004
You're happy?
- You're not?

05:38.130 --> 05:40.923
All we do is argue.
- That is bullshit.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.591
Maybe she was just
in a bad mood.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.677
Yeah, maybe like
a- a hormonal thing.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.388
- P.M.S?
- What do you know about P.M.S?

05:47.472 --> 05:50.808
- More than you' Tom.
- Then what happened?

05:50.892 --> 05:52.893
This can't come as
a total surprise to you.

05:52.978 --> 05:55.396
I mean, we've been
like Sid and Nancy
for months now.

05:55.480 --> 05:59.358
Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy...
seven times with a kitchen knife.

05:59.443 --> 06:04.739
I- I mean, we have some disagreements,
but I hardly think I'm Sid Vicious.

06:04.823 --> 06:07.908
No. I'm Sid.

06:07.993 --> 06:10.244
Oh, so I'm Nancy?

06:14.332 --> 06:17.877
Let's just eat,
and we'll talk about it later.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.713
Mmm. That is good.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.382
I'm really glad we did this.

06:23.467 --> 06:25.593
I love these pancakes.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.430
What?

06:29.514 --> 06:33.142
Tom, don't go.
You're still my best friend!

06:34.811 --> 06:36.896
- Jesus.
- You've broken up with girls before.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.564
Yes.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.399
And girls have broken up
with you before.

06:40.525 --> 06:41.692
This is different.
- Why?

06:41.777 --> 06:42.818
'Cause it's Summer.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.696
So you'll-you'll
meet somebody new.

06:45.781 --> 06:48.783
Point is, you're
the best guy I know.
You'll get over her.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.535
I think it's kind of like how they say.
There's, uh-

06:51.620 --> 06:53.537
There's plenty of other
fish in the sea.

06:53.663 --> 06:56.082
No.
- They- They say that.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.167
Well, they're lying.

06:59.503 --> 07:01.837
I don't want to get over her.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.341
I want to get her back.

07:05.509 --> 07:08.928
Maybe playing it safe
is the wrong approach.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.930
The nuclear family is dead'

07:11.014 --> 07:13.724
and we need a new holiday
that recognizes that.

07:13.809 --> 07:15.810
May 21 st.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.397
Other Mother's Day.

07:21.817 --> 07:23.984
Thank you.

07:24.069 --> 07:27.446
I'd say we've got
some potential here.
What do you think, Hansen?

07:27.531 --> 07:30.366
Could you write up some
prototypes for these?

07:30.450 --> 07:33.119
Uh' Mr. Vance,
there's a telephone call
for you on line three.

07:33.203 --> 07:37.832
Oh. Thank you.
Uh' everyone, this is Summer,
my new assistant.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.167
Summer just moved here from-

07:40.293 --> 07:42.753
Michigan.
- Right. Michigan. Right.

07:42.838 --> 07:45.131
Uh, Summer, everyone.

07:45.215 --> 07:48.300
Everyone, Summer.
Excuse me. I have to take this.

07:49.678 --> 07:52.179
It's nice to meet you all.

07:52.264 --> 07:56.142
There's only two kinds
of people in the world.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.352
There's women, and there's men.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.648
Summer Finn was a woman.

08:02.732 --> 08:06.402
Height, average. Weight, average.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.488
Shoe size, slightly above average.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.574
For all intents and purposes,

08:11.658 --> 08:14.702
Summer Finn, just another girl.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.704
Except she wasn't.

08:16.788 --> 08:19.248
To wit, in 1998,

08:19.332 --> 08:22.251
Summer quoted a song
by the Scottish band
Belle and Sebastian...

08:22.335 --> 08:24.253
in her high school yearbook.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.964
"Color my life
with the chaos of trouble."

08:27.048 --> 08:28.924
This spike in Michigan
sales of their album...

08:29.009 --> 08:31.177
The Boy with the Arab Strap...

08:31.261 --> 08:33.679
continues to puzzle industry analysts.

08:33.763 --> 08:37.683
Summer's employment
at the Daily Freeze
during her sophomore year...

08:37.767 --> 08:41.687
coincided with an inexplicable
212% increase in revenue.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.024
Every apartment Summer rented...

08:45.108 --> 08:49.904
was offered at an average rate
of 9.2% below market value.

08:49.988 --> 08:52.489
And her round-trip commute to work...

08:52.574 --> 08:56.076
averaged 18.4 double takes per day.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.913
It was a rare quality,
this "Summer effect."

08:58.997 --> 09:03.000
Rare, and yet something
every postadoles cent male
has encountered...

09:03.084 --> 09:05.002
at least once in their lives.

09:05.086 --> 09:09.173
For Tom Hans en to find it now
in a city of 400,000 offices,

09:09.257 --> 09:13.719
91,000 commercial buildings
and 3.8 million people-

09:13.803 --> 09:17.056
Well, that could only
be explained by one thing:

09:17.140 --> 09:19.099
fate.

09:22.646 --> 09:24.855
Dude, I hear she's a bitch.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.690
Really?

09:26.775 --> 09:29.818
Yeah. Patel tried to talk
to her in the copy room.
She's totally not having it.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.528
Maybe she was just in a hurry.

09:31.613 --> 09:34.365
And maybe she's an uppity,
"better than everyone" superskank.

09:36.451 --> 09:39.703
Damn.
I know.
She's pretty hot.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.830
That sucks.
Why is it pretty girls...

09:41.915 --> 09:44.333
think they can treat people like crap
and get away with it?

09:44.417 --> 09:46.502
Centuries of reinforcement.

09:46.586 --> 09:50.089
You know what? Screw her.
I don't care.

09:50.173 --> 09:52.591
If she wants to be that way, fine.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.943
# Driving in your car#

10:11.027 --> 10:14.613
# Oh, please don't drop me home #

10:14.698 --> 10:16.740
Smiths?

10:16.825 --> 10:18.826
Hi.

10:20.912 --> 10:23.831
I love the Smiths.
Sorry?

10:23.915 --> 10:25.874
I said I love the Smiths.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.547
You have- You have
good taste in music.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.632
You like the Smiths?
- Yeah.

10:33.717 --> 10:37.720
# To die by your side is
such a heavenly way to die #

10:37.846 --> 10:40.431
I love 'em.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.602
Holy shit.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.361
There you go.
Have another piece.

10:54.446 --> 10:55.863
Ah.
Drinks?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.906
Arthur, did you get a piece?
- Thanks.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.242
Want one? Yeah.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.620
Want one?
- Mmm.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.792
Summer, right?
- Oh. Yeah.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.503
Smiths fan.
- Yeah. Tom.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.922
Want some, uh, uh-

11:14.049 --> 11:16.925
It's not champagne.
I don't know what it is.
- Sure.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.428
So, how's it goin'?

11:19.554 --> 11:21.472
Pretty good.
You just moved here, right?

11:21.598 --> 11:22.806
Mm-hmm.
- When?

11:22.932 --> 11:25.601
Saturday.
- Oh, wow.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.103
And, uh, what brought you?

11:29.689 --> 11:31.565
Boredom mostly.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.193
Wanted to try something
new and exciting.
- Mmm.

11:34.319 --> 11:37.071
Well, clearly you've
come to the right place.

11:39.240 --> 11:43.243
So, have you
worked here long?
- About three or four years.

11:43.328 --> 11:46.330
Wow. You've...

11:46.456 --> 11:48.624
always wanted to write
greeting cards?

11:48.708 --> 11:50.626
No, I don't even
want to do it now.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.961
Well, you should
do something else then.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.256
Yeah. I studied to be
an architect, actually.

11:56.341 --> 11:59.343
You did? That's cool.
What happened there?

12:00.595 --> 12:02.513
It didn't work out.

12:02.597 --> 12:05.474
I needed a job, and here we are.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.142
You any good?

12:07.227 --> 12:10.604
Well, um, I wrote this one.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.609
"Today you're a man.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.569
Mazel tov
on your bar mitzvah."

12:17.695 --> 12:20.531
It's a big seller.
I meant as an architect.

12:20.615 --> 12:23.117
Yeah.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.327
I doubt it.
- Well,

12:25.412 --> 12:28.372
you're a perfectly adequate
greeting card writer.

12:28.456 --> 12:31.166
Thank you. That was actually
my nickname in college.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.168
They called me
"Perfectly Adequate" Hansen.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.170
They used to call me Anal Girl.

12:38.842 --> 12:42.177
I was very neat and organized.

12:45.557 --> 12:48.475
Well, I should get back, so-
Uh-

12:48.560 --> 12:50.644
All right. See you later.

13:36.065 --> 13:40.319
I don't know, man.
I think it's official.

13:40.403 --> 13:43.572
I'm in love with Summer.
I love her smile.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.867
I love her hair. I love her knees.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.203
I love this heart-shaped birthmark
she has on her neck.

13:49.287 --> 13:52.789
I love the way she sometimes
licks her lips before she talks.

13:52.874 --> 13:55.584
I love the sound of her laugh.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.753
I love the way she looks
when she's sleeping.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.757
# She's like the wind #

14:01.841 --> 14:04.635
I love how I hear this song
every- every time I think of her.

14:04.719 --> 14:07.095
I love how she makes me feel.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.097
Like-

14:09.182 --> 14:12.309
Like anything's possible,
or like- I don't know. Like-

14:13.394 --> 14:15.812
Like life is worth it.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.318
This is not good.

14:23.613 --> 14:26.448
She likes Magritte and Hopper.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.034
And we talked
about Bananafish
for like 20 minutes.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.078
We're so compatible,
it's insane.

14:31.162 --> 14:34.456
She's- well, she's not
like I thought at all.
She's amazing.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.084
Oh, boy.
- What?

14:37.168 --> 14:41.922
Just 'cause some
cute girl likes the same
bizarro crap you do,

14:42.006 --> 14:44.007
that doesn't make her
your soul mate, Tom.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.969
- Red team wins!
- What do you mean?

14:48.388 --> 14:50.430
- It's off.
- what?

14:50.515 --> 14:52.432
- Me and Summer.
- Was it ever on?

14:52.517 --> 14:55.686
No, but it could have been,
in a world where
good things happen to me.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.896
- Yeah, well, that's not
really where we live.
- No.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.107
Lucky.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.693
So, what happened?

15:02.819 --> 15:04.736
All right. You ready?
- Yeah.

15:04.821 --> 15:07.781
So there we are.
Nine more floors to ride,
just me and her.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.866
Hey, Summer.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.952
Hi.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.455
How was your weekend?

15:15.540 --> 15:17.457
It was good.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.293
Can you believe that shit?

15:19.377 --> 15:21.378
I'm sorry. what shit?

15:21.462 --> 15:25.299
- I think I missed something.
- She said, "It was good."
Emphasis on the "good."

15:25.383 --> 15:28.885
She basically said she spent
the weekend having sex with
some guy she met at the gym.

15:28.970 --> 15:31.054
Skank. Whatever.
I'm over it.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.974
What the hell
is wrong with you?
- She's not interested in me.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.934
There's really nothing
I can do about that.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.395
Just because
she said it was good?
And some other things.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.689
Like, did she say, uh,
"hey" instead of "hi"?

15:40.773 --> 15:44.735
I mean, 'cause you know
that that- that means
that she's a lesbian, right?

15:44.819 --> 15:46.903
I gave her plenty of chances.

15:46.988 --> 15:50.657
I'm going to the supply room.
Do you guys need anything?

15:50.742 --> 15:53.410
I think you know what I need.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.041
Uh, toner.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.168
Okay. Sure. No problem.

16:08.885 --> 16:14.723
# Good times for a change #

16:14.807 --> 16:17.643
# See, the luck I've had #

16:17.727 --> 16:21.396
# Can make a good man turn bad #

16:22.732 --> 16:26.777
# So, please, please, please #

16:26.861 --> 16:30.530
# Let me, let me, let me #

16:30.615 --> 16:33.950
# Let me get what I want ##

16:34.035 --> 16:38.080
Whatever, man. It's fine.
I don't need this crap really.
I just, you know-

16:38.164 --> 16:41.249
I'm comfortable.
I'm unhassled.

16:42.877 --> 16:45.504
People don't realize this,
but loneliness-

16:47.632 --> 16:50.258
- It's underrated.
- You could just ask her out.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.345
Don't be stupid.

16:53.554 --> 16:57.641
Hey.

17:00.311 --> 17:04.146
This Friday, all you can
karaoke at the Mill.
- No.

17:04.272 --> 17:07.358
Come on.
They're not gonna let you
back in there after last time.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.611
Ah, I wasn't that bad.

17:09.695 --> 17:12.698
Dude, you threw up
on the stage, you tried to
fight the bartender...

17:12.781 --> 17:14.657
and you threatened to
burn the place down.

17:14.784 --> 17:17.536
But I didn't
burn the place down.
- We're not going back there, man.

17:17.619 --> 17:21.205
Look. It's not like that, okay?
It's a work thing.
The whole office is going.

17:21.332 --> 17:23.791
I can't go, even if I wanted-
You're not listening to me.

17:23.917 --> 17:27.295
What?
- The whole office is going.

17:35.346 --> 17:39.015
#Just like every cowboy #

17:39.100 --> 17:43.061
# Sings a sad, sad song #

17:43.146 --> 17:48.358
# Every rose has its thorn ##

17:48.484 --> 17:50.360
Hi.
- Hi.

17:50.486 --> 17:53.238
They said you weren't coming.
You asked if I was-

17:53.322 --> 17:55.574
Goddamn. That song is brilliant!

17:55.700 --> 17:57.659
What's up, Hansen?
Summer. Summer-

17:57.744 --> 18:00.203
That's me.
Come on up.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.539
You-

18:02.623 --> 18:07.502
Okay. I'm new,
so no making fun of me.
- Whoo!

18:07.587 --> 18:09.921
Thanks, chief.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.965
Ah, thanks.
- Yeah, man.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.258
Cheers.

18:16.721 --> 18:20.724
# I got some troubles
but they won't last #

18:20.808 --> 18:24.895
# I'm gonna lay right down
here in the grass #

18:24.979 --> 18:28.774
# And pretty soon
all my troubles will pass #

18:28.858 --> 18:31.401
# 'Cause I'm in Su-Su-Su #

18:31.486 --> 18:33.403
# Su-Su-Su #

18:33.488 --> 18:35.864
# Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su #

18:35.948 --> 18:38.158
# Sugar Town ##

18:46.959 --> 18:49.085
Like, that's what I was-
I guess.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.129
Hello.
- Hi.

18:51.214 --> 18:53.799
I didn't, uh- I didn't know
you were gonna join us.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.051
I would have gotten you,
you know, a drink, or-

18:56.177 --> 18:58.053
I'm good.
- You're good?

18:58.179 --> 19:01.223
You- You were great-
great up, uh, singing.
- Thank you.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.600
I wanted to sing "Born To Run,"
but they didn't have it.

19:03.726 --> 19:05.644
I love "Born To Run."
- Me too.

19:05.728 --> 19:08.104
Tom's from New Jersey.
- Really?

19:08.189 --> 19:10.982
Yeah. I grew up there.
Uh, I lived there till I was 12.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.901
I named my cat
after Springsteen.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.903
No kidding.
What-what was his name?

19:14.987 --> 19:16.947
Bruce.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.573
Oh.
That makes sense.

19:21.244 --> 19:23.245
So, do you have a boyfriend?

19:23.329 --> 19:25.247
- No.
- Why not?

19:25.331 --> 19:28.750
- 'Cause I don't want one.
- Come on. I don't believe that.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.795
You don't believe
that a woman could enjoy
being free and independent?

19:31.879 --> 19:33.839
Are you a lesbian?

19:33.923 --> 19:36.049
No, I'm not a lesbian.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.343
I just don't feel comfortable
being anyone's girlfriend.

19:38.427 --> 19:42.055
I don't actually feel
comfortable being anyone's
anything, you know.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.599
- I don't know what
you're talking about.
- Really?

19:44.684 --> 19:46.685
Nope.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.770
Okay. Let me
break it down for you.

19:48.855 --> 19:53.024
- Break it down.
- Okay. I like being on my own.

19:53.109 --> 19:56.152
Relationships are messy,
and people's feelings get hurt.

19:56.237 --> 19:58.405
Who needs it? We're young.

19:58.489 --> 20:00.949
We live in one of
the most beautiful
cities in the world.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.285
Might as well have fun
while we can and...

20:03.369 --> 20:05.704
save the serious stuff for later.

20:05.788 --> 20:09.040
Holy shit. You're a dude.
She's a dude.

20:09.125 --> 20:13.169
Okay. But wait, wait.
What happens if you fall in love?

20:13.296 --> 20:15.213
What?

20:15.298 --> 20:17.257
Well, you don't
believe that, do you?

20:17.341 --> 20:19.634
It's love.
It's not Santa Claus.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.636
Well, what does
that word even mean?

20:21.721 --> 20:24.764
I've been in relationships,
and I don't think I've ever seen it.

20:24.891 --> 20:28.018
Well, maybe that's-
- And most marriages end
in divorce these days.

20:28.144 --> 20:30.395
Like my parents.
- Okay. Mine too, but-

20:30.479 --> 20:33.189
Me thinks the lady
doth protest too much.

20:33.274 --> 20:36.484
The lady dothn't.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.613
There's no such thing as love.
It's a fantasy.

20:39.697 --> 20:42.324
Well, I think you're wrong.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.494
Okay. Well,

20:46.579 --> 20:49.122
what is it that
I'm missing then?

20:51.292 --> 20:53.627
I think you know it
when you feel it.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.341
I guess we can just
agree to disagree.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.762
Yeah.

21:03.846 --> 21:06.473
Okay. Who's singing next?

21:06.557 --> 21:09.267
I nominate
young Werther here.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.478
I'm not nearly
drunk enough to-
Bartender.

21:11.604 --> 21:15.732
Whoo! Whoo!
# outside there's a boxcar waiting #

21:15.816 --> 21:19.986
# Outside the family stew #

21:20.112 --> 21:23.323
# out by the fire breathing #
Whoo! Whoo!

21:23.407 --> 21:27.452
# Outside we wait
till our face turns blue #

21:27.536 --> 21:31.498
# I know the nervous walking #

21:31.582 --> 21:35.543
# I know the dirty beard
ha-ha-hangs #

21:35.628 --> 21:38.964
# Out by the boxcar waiting #

21:39.048 --> 21:42.926
# Take me away
to nowhere plains #

21:43.052 --> 21:46.972
# There is a wait so long #
# So long, so long #

21:47.056 --> 21:50.809
# There is a wait so long #

21:50.893 --> 21:52.769
# Here comes your man #

21:52.895 --> 21:56.690
Whoo! You're good!
# Here comes your man #

21:58.609 --> 22:02.237
# Here comes your man ##
Is it-

22:04.407 --> 22:06.282
It's not?
No, that's not it.

22:06.409 --> 22:08.284
What is that then?
I don't know. That-

22:08.411 --> 22:10.578
That- That's something,
but that's not it.
- I know.

22:10.705 --> 22:13.081
Ah, I used to
watch it every week.
- Oh. Yeah!

22:13.207 --> 22:15.166
It was the best show on TV.
- I know.

22:15.251 --> 22:17.460
Knight Rider? Come on.
- And the theme song is really good.

22:17.586 --> 22:20.547
So good.
- This is gonna
bother me for a week.

22:20.631 --> 22:22.549
Me too.

22:22.633 --> 22:26.052
# And I'm proud to be an American #

22:26.137 --> 22:28.847
# Where at least I know I'm free #

22:28.931 --> 22:32.851
# And I'd like to entertain- ##

22:36.272 --> 22:38.314
- You were amazing.
- I know, buddy.

22:38.441 --> 22:40.316
You're amazing.

22:40.443 --> 22:42.360
This was so much fun.
- Yeah.

22:42.445 --> 22:44.654
You guys are so much-
- Wait! wait! Hey.

22:44.739 --> 22:47.073
What's up?
- Not you.

22:47.158 --> 22:49.117
You.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.827
He likes you.
- Okay.

22:50.953 --> 22:52.829
He likes likes you!
- Good night, McKenzie.

22:52.955 --> 22:54.831
Why don't you just
tell her, Tom?
- Yeah.

22:54.957 --> 22:57.667
You guys are the best!
Sorry you had to see that. He's-

22:57.752 --> 22:59.961
Happens every time we come here.
He, uh- I don't know.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.921
Something about
that guy and singing.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.049
Is that true?
- Yeah, yeah.

23:04.133 --> 23:07.177
He drinks, and he sings
and just loses his shit.

23:07.261 --> 23:09.387
No, uh, not McKenzie.

23:09.472 --> 23:11.473
Um, the other thing.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.475
What thing?

23:14.560 --> 23:16.561
Do you... like me?

23:19.231 --> 23:21.900
Yeah.

23:21.984 --> 23:23.985
Yeah, of course I like you.

23:24.987 --> 23:26.946
As friends?

23:27.990 --> 23:30.033
Right. As friends.

23:30.117 --> 23:32.994
Just as friends?

23:33.079 --> 23:37.499
Yeah. I mean, I- I don't know.
I hadn't really thought about, um-

23:37.583 --> 23:39.876
Yes. why?

23:39.960 --> 23:43.254
No reason. I just-

23:43.339 --> 23:47.842
I think you're interesting,
and I'd like for us to be friends.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.011
Is that all right?

23:52.056 --> 23:54.724
Yeah. It's, um-

23:54.850 --> 23:57.894
Yeah. You and me.
We should be friends.
- Mmm.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.979
Okay. Good.

24:08.823 --> 24:12.033
Well, I'm that way, so-

24:14.453 --> 24:17.122
Okay. Well, good night.
- Good night.

24:35.266 --> 24:38.101
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:05.754 --> 25:08.590
So, that was fun
the other night.

25:48.005 --> 25:49.881
You son of a bitch.
- Shh!

25:50.007 --> 25:52.926
The same girl you've been
obsessing over for weeks now?
I've not been obsessing.

25:53.010 --> 25:55.511
The girl you said was out
of your league, that you'd
never have a chance with.

25:55.638 --> 25:56.679
That girl.
- Paul, seriously.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.264
Did you bang her?
- No.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.142
What, hum job? Hand job?
- Man, no.

26:01.227 --> 26:05.730
No jobs. I'm still unemployed.
We- We kissed.

26:05.814 --> 26:08.566
Level with me, man. Come on.
This is your best friend, huh?

26:08.651 --> 26:12.111
Your best friend who tolerated
you whining about this girl
for weeks on end.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.321
Paul-
- You were essentially
stalking her!

26:13.405 --> 26:15.156
Paul! Shh!

26:19.245 --> 26:21.746
- Hi.
- Hey.

26:21.830 --> 26:24.123
I'm Summer.
- Summer.

26:24.208 --> 26:27.502
I'm Paul.
- Hi, Paul. Nice to meet you.

26:31.548 --> 26:35.260
Well, I gotta go.
I gotta do some, you know.

26:35.386 --> 26:38.388
Yeah, man.
- Um, pretend I was never here.

26:38.472 --> 26:41.224
Oh, wait! Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.
Um, if any jobs come up-

26:41.308 --> 26:43.643
Thanks, Paul! See ya!

26:46.480 --> 26:51.276
He's, uh, you know,
an old friend.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.569
If you heard any of, um-

26:53.696 --> 26:56.072
Heard what?
- Nothing. You wanna go?

26:56.156 --> 26:58.825
Yeah. I'm stalking.
I mean, I'm starving.

27:02.788 --> 27:05.665
Ah, hon?

27:05.749 --> 27:07.709
Our sink is broken.

27:12.089 --> 27:15.383
Man, all of our sinks
are broken.

27:22.766 --> 27:24.726
What are we looking for again?

27:24.810 --> 27:26.978
Uh, trivets.
How 'bout a fly gel?

27:27.062 --> 27:29.105
No, I don't think so.

27:29.231 --> 27:32.191
No? You don't
want a fly gel?

27:32.276 --> 27:34.277
Home sweet home.

27:36.739 --> 27:40.366
Our place really
is lovely, isn't it?

27:40.451 --> 27:42.368
Yes.

27:42.453 --> 27:44.579
Ooh! Idol's on.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.630
The TV's not working.

27:54.715 --> 27:56.966
Oh.

27:57.051 --> 28:00.762
Well, I'm famished.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.764
Let's eat.

28:07.895 --> 28:09.854
Mmm. Smells delicious.

28:09.938 --> 28:13.941
Oh, honey, that's because
it is delicious.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.070
I made it myself.

28:17.154 --> 28:19.447
Bald eagle.
Your favorite.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.949
Mm-hmm.

28:27.122 --> 28:29.624
The sink's broken.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.834
Well, that's okay, because...

28:34.046 --> 28:36.506
that's why we bought a home
with two kitchens.

28:36.590 --> 28:38.883
You're so smart.

28:38.967 --> 28:41.302
I'll race you to the bedroom.

28:41.387 --> 28:44.138
# Left behind #

28:44.223 --> 28:47.225
# There goes the fear again #

28:48.477 --> 28:51.979
# Let it go #

28:53.065 --> 28:56.776
# There goes the fear##

29:01.698 --> 29:05.076
Darling, I don't know
how to tell you this,

29:05.160 --> 29:09.372
but... there's a Chinese family
in our bathroom.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.809
This is fun.

29:29.935 --> 29:32.520
You're fun.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.522
Thanks.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.028
Hey, um,

29:41.113 --> 29:44.365
I just wanna tell you
that, um,

29:44.450 --> 29:47.535
I'm not really looking...

29:47.619 --> 29:51.247
for anything... serious.

29:54.001 --> 29:56.711
Is that okay?

29:56.795 --> 29:58.713
Yeah.

30:01.258 --> 30:03.926
'Cause some people
kind of freak out
when they hear that.

30:04.011 --> 30:06.512
No, not me.

30:06.597 --> 30:08.973
You sure?

30:09.057 --> 30:12.977
Yeah. Like, casual.
- Right? Take it slow.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.021
Right.

30:15.105 --> 30:17.106
No pressure.

30:50.474 --> 30:52.808
Can you, uh-
Can you wait one second?

31:00.526 --> 31:04.195
Okay. Settle.
She's just a girl.

31:04.279 --> 31:06.239
Just a girl.

31:06.323 --> 31:08.950
She wants to keep it casual,

31:09.034 --> 31:11.536
which is why she's
in my bed right now.

31:11.620 --> 31:14.247
But that's casual.
That's what casual people do.

31:16.124 --> 31:18.125
That's fine. That's great.

31:24.466 --> 31:26.467
Hi.
- Hi.

31:39.773 --> 31:44.986
# What I want you've got
and it might be hard to handle #

31:45.070 --> 31:47.280
# Like the flame that burns the candle #

31:47.364 --> 31:50.449
# The candle feeds the flame #

31:50.534 --> 31:53.578
# Yeah, yeah
what I've got full stock #

31:53.704 --> 31:56.038
# of thoughts and dreams
that scatter#

31:56.123 --> 31:59.292
# You're pullin' them all together #

31:59.376 --> 32:02.795
# And I can't explain
oh, yeah #

32:02.879 --> 32:05.423
# Well, well, you #
Hey.

32:05.507 --> 32:07.425
# Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh #
Hello.

32:07.509 --> 32:09.427
# You make my dreams come true #

32:09.511 --> 32:12.221
# Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh #
Hi.

32:12.306 --> 32:15.182
# Ooh-ooh #
# well, well, well, you #

32:15.267 --> 32:18.019
# Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh #
# oh, yeah #

32:18.103 --> 32:21.355
# You make my dreams come true #
Thanks.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.774
# ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh #
# Yeah, oh, yeah #

32:23.859 --> 32:25.276
# You #

32:25.360 --> 32:30.323
# on a night when bad dreams
become a screamer#

32:30.407 --> 32:33.409
# when they're messin'
with the dreamer#

32:33.493 --> 32:35.953
# I can laugh it in the face #

32:37.039 --> 32:39.290
# Twist and shout my way out #

32:39.374 --> 32:41.792
# And wrap yourself around me #

32:41.877 --> 32:44.754
# 'Cause I ain't the way you found me #

32:44.838 --> 32:48.299
# And I'll never be the same
oh, yeah #

32:48.383 --> 32:50.551
# Well, well, you #

32:53.138 --> 32:55.348
# You make my dreams come true #

32:55.432 --> 32:58.225
# ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh #
# whoa, yeah #

32:58.310 --> 33:01.145
# Ooh-ooh #
# well, well, well, you #

33:01.229 --> 33:03.939
# Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh #
# Whoo-whoo #

33:04.024 --> 33:07.360
# You make my dreams come true #

33:07.444 --> 33:09.236
# ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh #

33:09.321 --> 33:11.280
# oh-oh-oh, yeah #
# Ooh-ooh #

33:11.365 --> 33:13.783
# Now listen to this #

33:13.867 --> 33:17.203
# I'm down on my daydream #

33:17.287 --> 33:20.456
# oh, that sleepwalk
should be over by now #

33:20.540 --> 33:22.458
# Oh, no #

33:23.460 --> 33:25.795
# Yeah, you #

33:25.879 --> 33:27.338
# Yeah ##

33:39.142 --> 33:41.811
You know, I'm gonna- I'm gonna-
I'm gonna get Alfredo's number.

33:41.937 --> 33:43.854
Okay.
- And I'll- And I'll bring it to you.

33:43.939 --> 33:44.897
Okay.
- Okay?

33:44.981 --> 33:46.148
Is this Solitaire?

33:46.233 --> 33:48.818
So, did you get her back
yet or what?

33:51.571 --> 33:53.572
Working on it.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.954
Hey, maybe you should
write a book.
- What?

34:00.038 --> 34:02.832
Well, you know, Henry Miller
said the best way
to get over a woman...

34:02.916 --> 34:04.875
is to turn her into literature.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.795
Well, that guy had
a lot more sex than me.

34:11.925 --> 34:14.260
Oh, this is it! This is it!

34:14.344 --> 34:16.344
So great to hear from you.

34:16.429 --> 34:18.389
I can't this week, but maybe next?

34:18.473 --> 34:20.599
I hope this means
you're ready to be friends.

34:37.242 --> 34:40.034
Yeah, that's it. That is it.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.580
Your girl is losing it.

34:42.664 --> 34:45.166
Can you just be serious,
for just a second?

34:45.292 --> 34:47.376
I am being totally serious.
- No, you're joking around.

34:47.502 --> 34:50.129
No, I am not joking around.
"Octopus's Garden"?

34:50.213 --> 34:52.840
Yes, "Octopus's Garden"
is the best Beatles song
ever recorded.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.717
Why don't you just say "Piggies"?

34:54.801 --> 34:56.802
Come on. I love Ringo Starr!

34:56.928 --> 35:00.598
Nobody loves Ringo Starr.
- That's what I love about him.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.852
No, no.

35:07.481 --> 35:10.024
Ooh, this looks good.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.401
Gets really good reviews.

35:15.864 --> 35:20.117
You know what?
That looks pretty doable.

35:20.243 --> 35:23.120
Why are you asking me now?
- Because this was your idea.

35:25.207 --> 35:27.166
Put your hand there.
- Wait one second.

35:27.292 --> 35:31.420
Okay. Three, two, one!
- One.

35:34.591 --> 35:38.219
Yeah, the street level
isn't so exciting, but-

35:38.345 --> 35:42.932
Like, if you look up-
# Sweet #

35:43.016 --> 35:47.895
# Disposition #

35:47.979 --> 35:51.148
The Fine Arts Building.

35:51.233 --> 35:56.946
The guys who designed this,
Walker and Eisen,
are... two of my favorites.

35:57.030 --> 36:00.991
# Never #
Isn't that cool?

36:01.076 --> 36:05.746
# Too soon ##

36:11.878 --> 36:14.004
This is my favorite spot.
- This is?

36:14.089 --> 36:16.423
This is your favorite spot?

36:16.508 --> 36:18.801
Right here.

36:18.885 --> 36:21.804
How come?

36:21.888 --> 36:25.015
Uh, I don't know.
It's kind of hard to explain,
I guess.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.852
Well, try.

36:27.936 --> 36:30.688
Um- Well, okay.

36:30.772 --> 36:34.567
Like, that building- that's, uh-

36:34.651 --> 36:37.361
That's been there since 1911.

36:37.445 --> 36:40.573
And that- that's the Continental.
That's L.A.'s first skyscraper.

36:40.657 --> 36:43.033
It was built in 1904.

36:43.118 --> 36:44.827
What is that?

36:44.911 --> 36:46.912
That?

36:47.038 --> 36:50.082
That's a parking lot.
- Oh!

36:50.166 --> 36:53.627
Yeah. That's-
That's also a parking lot.

36:54.921 --> 36:57.381
That's, um- Yeah.

36:57.465 --> 37:00.009
There's a lot of beautiful
stuff here too though.

37:03.013 --> 37:07.141
I don't know.
I just... wish people
would notice it more.

37:07.225 --> 37:11.145
If it were me, then, uh-

37:11.229 --> 37:13.564
If it were you what?

37:13.648 --> 37:16.734
I don't know. I think
I'd... make 'em notice.

37:17.736 --> 37:20.070
How would you
make them notice?

37:22.490 --> 37:26.160
I don't know.
There's a lot of different
stuff you could do.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.704
Show me.

37:28.830 --> 37:32.416
Please. I don't know
anything about architecture.

37:32.542 --> 37:35.252
You want me to
draw you something?
- Yeah.

37:35.378 --> 37:38.797
I don't have any paper.
- Well, use my arm.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.968
Please, I need a tattoo.

37:43.094 --> 37:46.680
Well, let's see your arm.
- That's the spirit.

37:49.309 --> 37:53.270
Well, the buildings need
to be integrated better, so-

37:53.355 --> 37:56.273
You could maximize
light capacity here.

38:20.674 --> 38:22.675
It's kind of messy.

38:22.759 --> 38:24.760
That's okay.

38:36.523 --> 38:40.818
For Tom Hansen, this was the night
where everything changed.

38:40.902 --> 38:44.238
That wall Summer
so often hid behind-

38:44.322 --> 38:47.908
the wall of distance, of space, of casual-

38:49.285 --> 38:52.162
that wall was slowly coming down.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.958
For here was Tom, in her world,

38:56.042 --> 39:00.462
a place few had been invited
to see with their own eyes.

39:00.547 --> 39:02.798
And here was Summer,
wanting him there.

39:02.882 --> 39:05.634
Him, no one else.

39:05.719 --> 39:07.886
Have you ever been
in a tornado?
- No.

39:08.013 --> 39:11.765
It's that and
my teeth falling out.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.767
I have that too!
- You do?

39:13.852 --> 39:17.229
Yeah! It's so weird.
It's like being an old man.

39:17.313 --> 39:20.065
What else do you have?

39:20.150 --> 39:22.192
Um, earthquakes?

39:22.277 --> 39:24.528
Really?
- No.

39:27.407 --> 39:32.244
You know, I dream
sometimes about flying.

39:32.328 --> 39:35.330
It starts out like I'm running
really, really fast.

39:35.415 --> 39:37.332
I'm, like, superhuman.

39:37.417 --> 39:40.711
And the terrain starts to get
really rocky and steep.

39:40.795 --> 39:44.590
And then I'm running so fast
that my feet aren't even
touching the ground.

39:44.674 --> 39:49.303
And I'm floating,
and it's like this amazing,
amazing realness.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.140
I'm free. I'm safe.

39:53.224 --> 39:56.060
Then I realize,

39:56.144 --> 39:58.812
I'm completely alone.

40:01.775 --> 40:04.234
And then I wake up.

40:04.319 --> 40:06.320
As he listened, Tom began to realize...

40:06.404 --> 40:09.823
that these weren't stories
routinely told.

40:09.949 --> 40:13.285
These were stories
one had to earn.

40:13.369 --> 40:16.371
He could feel the wall coming down.

40:16.456 --> 40:19.750
He wondered if anyone else
had made it this far.

40:19.834 --> 40:23.837
Which is why the next six words
changed everything.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.924
I've never told anybody
that before.

40:31.012 --> 40:33.013
I guess I'm not just anybody.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.557
So what are you exactly?

40:35.683 --> 40:37.643
I don't know.
Are you her boyfriend?

40:37.727 --> 40:39.937
It's not that simple.
- Sure, it is.

40:40.021 --> 40:42.147
What, like, are we going steady?
- Come on, guys.

40:42.232 --> 40:44.858
You know, we're- we're adults.
We know how we feel.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.944
We don't need
to put labels on it.

40:47.028 --> 40:48.946
I mean,
"boyfriend," "girlfriend."

40:49.030 --> 40:52.533
All that stuff is-
It's really juvenile.

40:52.659 --> 40:55.077
You sound gay.
You really do.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.079
Okay, first of all,

40:57.163 --> 41:01.125
your last girlfriend
was Amy Sussman
in the seventh grade,

41:01.209 --> 41:03.919
and you dated
for, like, three hours.

41:04.003 --> 41:08.924
And you-
you've been with Robyn
since what- like 1998?

41:09.050 --> 41:11.426
'97.
- '97. See-

41:11.553 --> 41:14.304
Shoot.

41:14.389 --> 41:18.642
I don't think the two of you
are exactly authorities
on modern relationships.

41:24.607 --> 41:27.317
So, what should I do?
- You should ask her.

41:27.402 --> 41:29.319
What?

41:29.404 --> 41:32.030
Well, why rock the boat,
is what I'm thinking.

41:32.115 --> 41:34.116
I mean,
things are going well.

41:34.200 --> 41:36.743
You start putting labels on it,
that's like the kiss of death.

41:36.870 --> 41:40.664
It's like saying, "I love you."
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

41:40.748 --> 41:43.625
That's what happened
between me and Sean.

41:43.751 --> 41:46.336
Who the hell's Sean?
- My boyfriend before Mark.

41:46.421 --> 41:48.714
Who the- never mind.

41:48.840 --> 41:52.634
So, what you're saying-
I'm saying you do
want to ask her.

41:52.719 --> 41:55.846
It's obvious.
You're just afraid you'll get
an answer you don't want,

41:55.930 --> 42:00.017
which will shatter
all the illusions of how great
these past few months have been.

42:00.101 --> 42:02.019
Now look, if it were me,

42:02.103 --> 42:04.563
I'd find out now before you
show up at her place...

42:04.647 --> 42:08.650
and, well, she's in bed
with Lars from Norway.

42:08.735 --> 42:11.528
Who's Lars from Norway?

42:11.613 --> 42:13.530
Just some guy
she met at the gym...

42:13.615 --> 42:17.117
with Brad Pitt's face
and Jesus' abs.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.580
Wait! No, Coach.
We're not done here.

42:21.706 --> 42:23.707
Rachel!
- Look, it's easy, Tom.

42:23.791 --> 42:25.792
Just don't be a pussy.

42:42.810 --> 42:45.187
You okay?

42:45.313 --> 42:48.398
Yeah.
- You sure?

42:48.483 --> 42:51.109
Summer,
I gotta ask you something.

42:51.236 --> 42:53.237
What?
- What are we, um-

42:55.281 --> 42:58.075
What are we doing?
- I thought we were going
to the movies.

42:58.159 --> 43:00.577
Yeah. Nah, I mean, like,
what are we, like-

43:00.662 --> 43:03.288
What's going on here, with us?

43:03.373 --> 43:05.332
I don't know.

43:06.709 --> 43:08.835
Who cares?

43:08.962 --> 43:11.964
I'm happy. Aren't you happy?
- Yeah.

43:12.048 --> 43:13.966
Good.

43:49.836 --> 43:51.837
London, 1964.

43:51.921 --> 43:53.880
Those girls knew how to dress.

43:53.965 --> 43:57.551
Nowadays, it's all
these giant sunglasses...

43:57.635 --> 43:59.886
and tattoos.

43:59.971 --> 44:02.180
It's handbags with
little dogs in them.

44:02.265 --> 44:06.268
Who okayed this?
Some people like it.

44:08.021 --> 44:10.063
I like how you dress.

44:10.148 --> 44:13.692
I was thinking about
getting a butterfly tattoo
about yea big on my ankle.

44:13.776 --> 44:15.777
No.

44:15.862 --> 44:17.571
Oh.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.906
Yo.

44:19.991 --> 44:21.908
How's it going?

44:21.993 --> 44:24.161
Uh, okay.

44:24.245 --> 44:26.496
You live around here?

44:26.581 --> 44:28.749
Um, yeah, not too far.

44:28.833 --> 44:31.126
I've never
seen you here before.

44:31.210 --> 44:33.337
You're not too observant.

44:33.421 --> 44:36.423
That's funny. You're funny.

44:36.549 --> 44:39.051
So let me buy you a drink.
- No, Thank you.

44:41.262 --> 44:43.388
You with this guy?
- Hey, I'm Tom.

44:43.473 --> 44:46.058
Whatever.
So, come on. One drink.
What are you drinking?

44:46.142 --> 44:48.310
I said no, thanks.

44:48.394 --> 44:50.270
You're serious? This guy?

44:50.396 --> 44:52.356
Hey, buddy-
You know what?
Don't be rude.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.483
I'm flattered,
but I'm not interested.

44:54.567 --> 44:58.528
So why don't you go over there
and leave us alone? Thanks.

45:00.531 --> 45:02.532
It's a free country.

45:11.584 --> 45:14.753
I can't believe
this is your boyfriend.

45:21.636 --> 45:23.762
What are you doing?

45:25.848 --> 45:28.850
It was really just a crazy thing.

45:28.935 --> 45:32.270
It happened like-
It felt like it happened
fast, but really,

45:32.355 --> 45:35.440
it- it also felt like it
was happening really slowly,

45:35.525 --> 45:37.484
like everything all was just-

45:37.610 --> 45:41.238
I don't know. It doesn't
feel like you think it would-

45:41.322 --> 45:44.032
Hey, what's the matter?

45:44.117 --> 45:47.035
I just- I can't believe you.

45:47.120 --> 45:49.371
You can't believe me?

45:49.455 --> 45:52.165
You were so completely,
completely uncool in there.

45:52.250 --> 45:56.336
Wait. Are you mad at me?
I just got my ass kicked for you.

45:56.421 --> 45:58.713
Oh, really? Was that for me?
Was that for my benefit?

45:58.798 --> 46:00.424
Yes, it was.

46:00.508 --> 46:02.884
Okay, well, next time don't,
'cause I don't need your help.

46:02.969 --> 46:06.430
You know what?
I'm really tired.

46:09.058 --> 46:11.435
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

46:24.323 --> 46:26.283
No. You know what?

46:26.367 --> 46:29.786
I'm not going anywhere
till you tell me what's going on.

46:29.871 --> 46:31.872
Nothing's going on.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.917
We're just-

46:37.128 --> 46:40.255
What? We're just what?

46:40.381 --> 46:44.134
We're just friends.
- No! Don't pull that with me!

46:44.218 --> 46:46.219
Don't even try to-

46:46.304 --> 46:49.681
This is not how
you treat your friend.

46:49.765 --> 46:53.810
Kissing in the copy room?
Holding hands in IKEA?

46:53.895 --> 46:56.730
Shower sex? Come on!
Friends, my balls!

47:03.196 --> 47:05.655
I like you, Tom.
I just don't want a relationship-

47:05.740 --> 47:08.241
Well, you're not the only one
that gets a say in this!

47:08.326 --> 47:11.369
I do too! And I say we're
a couple, goddamn it!

47:17.793 --> 47:19.836
After you, please.

48:34.328 --> 48:36.329
I shouldn't have done that.

48:38.040 --> 48:40.875
Done what?
- Gotten mad at you.

48:40.960 --> 48:42.877
I'm sorry.

48:46.924 --> 48:50.969
Look, we don't have to
put a label on it.

48:51.053 --> 48:53.054
That's fine. I get it.

48:53.139 --> 48:56.224
But, you know, I just-
I need some consistency.

48:56.309 --> 48:58.685
I know.

48:58.769 --> 49:01.771
I need to know that
you're not gonna wake up
in the morning...

49:01.856 --> 49:04.482
and... feel differently.

49:11.407 --> 49:14.242
And I can't give you that.

49:14.327 --> 49:16.244
Nobody can.

49:25.338 --> 49:27.797
That hurt? I'm sorry.

49:27.882 --> 49:30.383
No, it doesn't hurt.

49:30.468 --> 49:32.802
I like you.

49:34.889 --> 49:36.890
All right.

49:46.567 --> 49:49.027
# You loved her
You were kissing #

49:49.111 --> 49:53.615
Shh. well, what about you?
- Did you ever even
have a boyfriend?

49:53.699 --> 49:55.617
Well, of course.
- Yeah?

49:55.701 --> 49:57.661
Yeah.
Well, tell me about them.

49:57.745 --> 49:59.663
No.
- Oh? why not?

49:59.747 --> 50:02.040
Because it's not important.

50:02.124 --> 50:04.626
I'm interested.

50:07.755 --> 50:09.839
All right. Fine.
You want to go there?

50:09.965 --> 50:12.133
Yeah. I can take it.
- Fine.

50:15.429 --> 50:17.764
So-

50:17.848 --> 50:20.934
Well, in high school
there was Markus.

50:21.018 --> 50:23.311
Quarterback-slash-homecoming king?

50:23.396 --> 50:25.897
No. He was a rower.

50:27.108 --> 50:29.025
He was very hot.

50:30.945 --> 50:34.656
For a brief time in college
there was, um- there was Charlie.

50:37.201 --> 50:39.119
She was nice, but-

50:40.204 --> 50:42.956
And then there was
my semester in Sienna.

50:43.040 --> 50:45.041
Fernando Belardelli.

50:47.753 --> 50:49.629
Also known as "The Puma."

50:49.714 --> 50:53.174
- The Puma?
- Yeah, The Puma, 'cause, you know.

50:56.804 --> 50:58.972
So-

50:59.098 --> 51:02.308
Oh, that's it?
- The ones that lasted, yeah.

51:02.393 --> 51:04.853
What happened? Why-
Why didn't they work out?

51:04.937 --> 51:07.731
What always happens. Life.

51:13.487 --> 51:15.530
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

51:15.614 --> 51:18.575
No, it's not.
- It's awesome. Trust me.

51:18.659 --> 51:20.577
I'm serious.

51:21.829 --> 51:23.788
I'll go first.

51:25.458 --> 51:28.209
Penis.

51:36.802 --> 51:38.720
Penis.

51:38.804 --> 51:40.972
Penis!
Penis!

51:41.098 --> 51:43.016
Penis!
There's kids around.

51:43.100 --> 51:45.477
There are no kids around.

51:45.603 --> 51:47.771
Penis!
Penis!

51:47.897 --> 51:50.023
You having fun?
- Yeah.

51:50.107 --> 51:52.442
This is the kind of thing
you did with The Puma, isn't it?

51:52.526 --> 51:55.779
Oh, we rarely left the room.

51:55.863 --> 51:58.448
Penis!

51:58.574 --> 52:00.742
Sorry. Tourette's.
You know how it is.
Penis!

52:00.868 --> 52:02.869
She has it too. Penis!
Penis!

52:02.995 --> 52:06.456
Shh. Everyone's
looking over here.
- I'm done. I'm done.

52:06.540 --> 52:08.166
Are you done?
- I'm done.

52:08.250 --> 52:09.793
You're done?
- Yeah.

52:09.919 --> 52:12.086
This is too much.
- Unleash me. I'm done.

52:12.171 --> 52:14.172
Promise?
- I promise.

52:15.633 --> 52:17.550
I promise.

52:17.635 --> 52:19.928
Penis!

52:33.984 --> 52:37.111
It's very complex.
- Mmm.

52:37.196 --> 52:40.240
In a way, it sort of, like,

52:40.324 --> 52:43.117
says... so much...

52:43.202 --> 52:45.995
by...

52:46.080 --> 52:48.373
saying so little.

52:54.338 --> 52:57.715
Do you want to go to the movies?
- Yep.

53:57.568 --> 53:59.485
Suffering.

53:59.570 --> 54:02.155
So much suffering.

54:04.158 --> 54:06.075
Suffering.
Suffering.

54:45.532 --> 54:47.450
T-Tom?

54:47.534 --> 54:50.036
Mr. Vance would like to
see you in his office.

54:51.705 --> 54:53.873
Tom.

54:53.958 --> 54:56.125
Have a seat.

54:59.380 --> 55:02.632
Has something happened
to you recently?

55:02.716 --> 55:04.717
What do you mean?

55:04.802 --> 55:08.262
A death in the family,
someone taken ill-
Anything like that.

55:08.347 --> 55:10.264
No.

55:11.767 --> 55:14.018
Look, I don't mean to pry, but...

55:14.103 --> 55:16.187
does this have something to do
with Summer leaving?

55:16.313 --> 55:19.440
Who?
My assistant.

55:19.566 --> 55:23.695
Your, um-
Tom, everyone knows.

55:25.990 --> 55:27.991
Never mind.

55:28.075 --> 55:31.953
The reason I'm asking is,
lately your work performance...

55:32.037 --> 55:34.706
has been... a little off.

55:34.832 --> 55:37.750
I'm not following.
- Okay.

55:37.835 --> 55:40.336
Um, here's something
that you wrote last week.

55:40.421 --> 55:43.506
Uh, "Roses are red,
violets are blue.

55:43.590 --> 55:45.842
Fuck you, whore."

55:45.926 --> 55:48.678
Now, most shoppers
at Valentine's Day-

55:48.804 --> 55:51.681
Mr. Vance, are you firing me?
- No. No.

55:51.765 --> 55:54.809
Relax, Hansen.
You're one of the good ones.

55:54.893 --> 55:57.520
Okay. Uh, yeah, I'm sorry.

55:57.604 --> 55:59.605
Things have been a little difficult.

55:59.690 --> 56:03.026
That's okay. I completely
understand that.

56:03.110 --> 56:07.530
I'm just saying
that perhaps you could
channel those energies,

56:07.614 --> 56:10.950
um, into something like this.

56:14.621 --> 56:16.581
Funerals and sympathy.

56:16.665 --> 56:20.043
Misery, sadness, loss of faith,

56:20.127 --> 56:22.253
no reason to live.

56:22.337 --> 56:24.839
This is perfect for you.

56:24.965 --> 56:27.425
Uh-
- Good. okay.

56:27.509 --> 56:29.927
Now back to work you go.

56:31.555 --> 56:36.684
Thank you.

56:52.159 --> 56:54.035
Hey.
- Hey.

56:54.161 --> 56:56.788
Don't you have, like,
20 cards to write by Friday?
- Nope. All done.

56:56.872 --> 56:59.916
Really? Can you help me?
'Cause I've run out of ways
to say "congrats."

57:00.000 --> 57:03.711
Okay. I got "Good job,"
"Well done" and "Way to go."

57:03.796 --> 57:05.421
That's it.

57:05.506 --> 57:09.592
How 'bout, "Every day
you make me proud,

57:10.594 --> 57:12.678
but today you get a card."

57:12.805 --> 57:15.306
Shit, that's good!
- I know.

57:16.350 --> 57:19.769
Have you tried "Merry"?

57:19.853 --> 57:23.147
Wow! That's perfect! Merry!
- Wow!

57:23.232 --> 57:26.275
We've been stuck on this
for an hour.

57:26.360 --> 57:29.654
Hmm. How about...

57:35.035 --> 57:37.036
"I love us"?

57:37.121 --> 57:38.579
Aw.

57:40.749 --> 57:42.250
I hate Summer.

57:42.334 --> 57:44.377
I hate her crooked teeth.

57:44.461 --> 57:46.170
I hate her 1960s haircut.

57:46.255 --> 57:47.964
I hate her knobby knees.

57:48.048 --> 57:50.925
And I hate her cockroach-shaped
splotch on her neck.

57:51.009 --> 57:53.928
I hate the way she smacks her lips
before she talks.

57:54.012 --> 57:56.514
And I hate the way she sounds
when she laughs.

57:58.308 --> 58:00.977
# She's like the wind #

58:01.061 --> 58:03.062
I hate this song!

58:04.231 --> 58:07.900
Son, you're gonna
have to exit the vehicle.

58:07.985 --> 58:10.153
I normally don't do blind dates,

58:10.237 --> 58:13.239
but Paul and Robyn spoke
very highly of you.

58:13.365 --> 58:15.783
Ah.
- They said you write
greeting cards.

58:15.868 --> 58:17.869
That's so interesting.
I wanted to write.

58:17.953 --> 58:20.246
I actually majored
in English in college,

58:20.330 --> 58:22.290
but what are you gonna do
with that degree?

58:22.416 --> 58:24.542
I went to Brown.
Where did you go?
- Alison.

58:24.626 --> 58:26.544
Hmm?

58:26.628 --> 58:28.921
Listen, it's great to meet you,

58:29.006 --> 58:31.382
and... you're a very attractive girl.

58:31.466 --> 58:34.427
I just wanted to say up front
that this isn't-

58:34.553 --> 58:38.014
It's not gonna go anywhere.
- Oh.

58:38.098 --> 58:41.767
I liked this girl.
I mean, I loved her.

58:41.852 --> 58:43.769
What does she do?

58:43.854 --> 58:47.481
She took a giant shit
on my face.

58:47.608 --> 58:50.067
Literally.
- Literally?

58:51.153 --> 58:54.322
Not literally.
That's disgusting. Jesus.

58:54.406 --> 58:56.616
What's the matter with you?

58:56.700 --> 58:58.618
The point is,

58:59.995 --> 59:02.079
I'm messed up. I am.

59:02.164 --> 59:04.415
You know, on the one hand,
I want to forget her.

59:04.499 --> 59:06.417
On the other hand,

59:06.501 --> 59:10.796
I know that she's the only person
in the entire universe
that will make me happy.

59:10.923 --> 59:12.882
Mm-hmm.
- You ever do this?

59:12.966 --> 59:17.595
You think back on the times
you had with someone, replay it
in your head over and over again,

59:17.679 --> 59:20.973
and you look for those
first signs of trouble.

59:23.602 --> 59:25.561
There's two options really.

59:25.646 --> 59:28.731
Either... she's an evil,

59:28.815 --> 59:32.068
emotionless,
miserable human being,

59:32.152 --> 59:36.239
or... she's a robot.

59:36.323 --> 59:38.282
Small Wonder.
- You know, Vicki.

59:38.408 --> 59:41.410
That would explain
a lot actually.
- Can I ask you a question?

59:42.829 --> 59:44.997
Yeah.
- She never cheated on you?

59:45.123 --> 59:49.418
No. Never.
- She ever take advantage
of you in any way?

59:49.503 --> 59:51.420
No.

59:51.505 --> 59:55.633
And she told you up front
that she didn't want a boyfriend.

59:57.052 --> 59:59.220
Yeah.

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:06.185
I got a great idea.

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:10.231
# Well, some things
you can explain away #

01:00:10.315 --> 01:00:13.734
# But my heartache's in me
every day #

01:00:13.819 --> 01:00:17.738
# Did you stand by me
No, not at all #

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:19.740
# Di- ##

01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:22.785
Oh, fine! Go!
That's fine. See ya.

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:25.955
Waste of time.
You don't look anything
like Summer.

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:31.544
Now departing on Track 2,
Pacific Surfliner.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:33.838
Full service to Santa Barbara.

01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:35.881
All aboard, please.

01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:45.182
Hey, baby.
- Hey, you here?

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:47.268
Hell no.
- What do you mean,
"Hell no"?

01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:49.979
I'm not going to that.
- Yes, you are.

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:52.023
No, man. It's gonna be
all old people.

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:54.483
Yeah, but you said you were going.
That's why I'm going.

01:00:54.568 --> 01:00:57.361
And that's why
I called her last night,
told her I was sick.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:01:00.906
Like a ninja.
Dude! I'm gonna- I'm not gonna
know anybody at this thing.

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:03.451
Maybe you'll meet
some hot granddaughters
or something.

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:05.578
I'm hanging up now.
Bye, baby.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:09.040
May I have your attention, please?

01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:11.417
Passengers boarding the train
in Los Angeles, please...

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:14.003
have your tickets out
and ready for collection.

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:47.328
Hi, Tom!

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:49.789
Hey. Summer.

01:01:49.915 --> 01:01:53.667
I must have walked right by you.
- Yeah.

01:01:53.752 --> 01:01:56.796
Well, um, what are you doing?
Are you going to Millie's?

01:01:59.174 --> 01:02:01.175
Me too.
Cool.

01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:05.846
- I forgot you knew her.
- Yeah, we worked together
all that time, so-

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:08.391
of course.
I love Millie.
She's the sweetest.

01:02:08.475 --> 01:02:10.518
She is.

01:02:10.602 --> 01:02:12.895
- How are you?
- I'm good.

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:15.231
Good. I- I wrote to you.
I never heard back, but-

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:17.775
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry about that.
I- I just, you know-

01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:21.195
It got kind of crazy,
and the holidays came up,
so work was-

01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:23.697
You still working for Vance?

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:25.574
Yeah.

01:02:25.659 --> 01:02:29.829
Well, I was gonna go get a coffee
if you wanna-

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.667
"The Architecture of Happiness."

01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:36.919
Yeah.
- That looks like a good book.

01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:39.046
Yeah, it's-

01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:43.300
Well, I don't want to bother you.
- No, no. I, um-

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:45.761
Yeah, let's get coffee.

01:02:45.846 --> 01:02:47.805
After you.

01:02:51.893 --> 01:02:55.229
# Sweet #

01:02:55.313 --> 01:03:02.027
# Disposition #

01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:12.913
# Never#

01:03:12.998 --> 01:03:18.544
# Too soon #

01:03:21.089 --> 01:03:24.592
# A moment, a love
A dream aloud #

01:03:24.676 --> 01:03:28.429
# A kiss, a cry
our rights, our wrongs #

01:03:28.555 --> 01:03:31.390
You look nice.
- Thanks.

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:33.434
So do you.
# Sweet #

01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:37.855
Well?
# Disposition ##

01:03:42.527 --> 01:03:44.445
Penis.

01:03:46.072 --> 01:03:47.990
No.

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:50.576
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.953
You may kiss the bride.

01:03:53.038 --> 01:03:55.331
# Helping the kids out of their coats #

01:03:55.415 --> 01:03:59.251
# Wait, the babies haven't been born #

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:03.297
# Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh #

01:04:03.381 --> 01:04:06.342
# Unpacking the bags and setting up #

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:09.261
# And planting lilacs and buttercups #

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:12.097
Okay. what else you got?

01:04:12.224 --> 01:04:14.308
Well, you snore.
- No, I don't.

01:04:14.434 --> 01:04:16.644
You do.
- No, I don't.

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:18.646
Yeah.
- Well, you do too.

01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:22.066
Oh, I definitely do.
And your feet reek.

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:24.151
That one time!
- No, every time.

01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:26.195
That one time!
No.

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:28.447
That one time especially,
but every time.

01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:32.701
And when you wake up,
your hair, it sticks up like that.

01:04:32.827 --> 01:04:34.870
It's ridiculous.
- You're ridiculous.

01:04:34.955 --> 01:04:36.914
Your favorite Beatle is Ringo.

01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:39.208
Damn right!

01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:41.502
Ringo's the best.
- Ringo is-

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:44.380
Goose!
Oh! oh! oh!

01:04:44.464 --> 01:04:48.634
Man! He's fast. Damn! All right.

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:50.719
You got me. Duck.

01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:53.055
Duck.

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:59.103
# At last #

01:04:59.187 --> 01:05:04.108
# My love has come along #

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:09.196
# My lonely days are over #

01:05:09.281 --> 01:05:11.240
One, two, three.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:18.330
# And life is like a song #

01:05:18.456 --> 01:05:20.374
Wanna dance?
- Yeah.

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:22.376
Okay.

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:25.170
# Oh, at last #

01:05:29.175 --> 01:05:32.177
# The skies above are blue #
Hey, I was wondering, um-

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:36.932
I was gonna maybe have
a party on Friday, um,

01:05:37.017 --> 01:05:41.395
on our roof top that has,
like, a really nice garden,

01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:43.480
if you want to come.

01:05:43.565 --> 01:05:45.566
Yeah.
# for you are mine #

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:47.985
If you're not busy.

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:51.113
# At last #
I don't think I will be.

01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:57.786
They're good, huh?
- They are good.

01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:28.567
I guess I just got lucky.

01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:30.986
Um, we met in elementary school.

01:06:31.071 --> 01:06:34.031
In seventh grade
we had the same class schedule,

01:06:34.115 --> 01:06:36.241
and, uh,

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:39.662
we just clicked, you know?

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:41.372
Love?

01:06:41.456 --> 01:06:43.165
Shit, I don't know.

01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:46.669
As long as she's cute
and she's willing, right?

01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:50.255
I'm flexible on the cute, so-

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:52.966
Twenty-one years.

01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:56.136
She's the light that guides me home.

01:06:56.221 --> 01:06:59.306
Yes, that is from one of our cards.

01:06:59.391 --> 01:07:01.392
No. Someone else wrote it.

01:07:01.476 --> 01:07:03.811
Doesn't make it less true.

01:07:03.895 --> 01:07:06.522
I think technically
the "girl of my dreams"...

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:11.318
would probably have, like,
a really bodacious rack, you know.

01:07:11.403 --> 01:07:13.821
Maybe different hair.

01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:16.365
Probably-
You know, she'd probably be
a little more into sports.

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:19.785
But, um, truthfully,

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:23.664
Robyn's- Robyn's better
than the girl of my dreams.

01:07:23.748 --> 01:07:26.125
She's real.

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:43.183
# He never, ever saw it coming at all #

01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:47.271
# Never, ever saw it coming at all #

01:07:47.355 --> 01:07:49.398
Tom walked to her apartment,

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:52.359
intoxicated by the promise of the evening.

01:07:52.444 --> 01:07:55.154
# It's all right
It's all right #
He believed that this time...

01:07:55.238 --> 01:07:58.073
his expectations would align with reality.

01:07:58.158 --> 01:08:00.492
# It's all right #

01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:11.170
# Hey, open wide
Here comes original sin #

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:13.630
Hi.
- Hey.

01:08:16.176 --> 01:08:18.635
# Hey, open wide
Here comes original sin #
You look nice.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.386
Yeah. Thanks.

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:22.180
I like your tie. Wow!
- Hi.

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:23.890
How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:26.225
Good.
# It's all right
It's all right #

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:29.604
# It's all right
It's all right, it's all right #

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.899
# It's all right #

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:36.779
# No one's got it all #
I, um, brought you something.

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:39.363
# No one's got it all #
That's so nice.

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:44.620
# No one's got it all #
Thank you.

01:08:44.746 --> 01:08:47.372
You shouldn't have.
That's so nice.
It's the-

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:49.374
Thank you so much.
- No problem.

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:51.460
I'm excited to read it.
- Yeah.

01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:53.504
Come on.

01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:55.671
# And we're going to these meetings #

01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:59.718
- So, Tom, what is it that you do?
- Uh, I write greeting cards.

01:08:59.803 --> 01:09:02.513
Tom could be
a really great architect
if he wanted to be.

01:09:02.596 --> 01:09:04.765
That's unusual.

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:06.934
I mean, what made you go
from one to the other?

01:09:07.018 --> 01:09:09.228
I guess I just figured,

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:11.979
why make something disposable,
like a building,

01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:15.984
when you can make something
that lasts forever, like a greeting card?

01:09:18.363 --> 01:09:22.533
# It's all right
It's all right #

01:09:22.617 --> 01:09:25.953
# It's all right
It's all right #

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:29.081
What?
# It's all right #

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:32.792
# No one's got it all #
Do you guys
know each other?

01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:39.758
# No one's got it all #

01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:43.845
# Power to the people
We don't want it #

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:47.140
# we want pleasure
And the TVs try to rape us #

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:49.560
# And I guess that they're succeeding #

01:09:49.644 --> 01:09:51.645
# And we're going to these meetings #

01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:54.022
# But we're not doing any meeting #

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:56.024
# And we're trying to be faithful #

01:09:56.109 --> 01:10:00.070
# But we're cheating
cheating, cheating #

01:10:00.154 --> 01:10:18.505
# I'm the hero of the story
Don't need to be saved #

01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:20.883
# It's all right #

01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:24.469
# It's all right
It's all right, it's all right #

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:27.264
# It's all right
It's all right #

01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:30.017
# It's all right
It's all right, it's all right #

01:10:30.101 --> 01:10:33.103
# It's all right
It's all right #

01:10:34.689 --> 01:10:46.450
# No one's got it all #

01:10:46.534 --> 01:10:48.785
# All, all #

01:10:49.871 --> 01:10:51.997
# All, all ##

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:15.812
# Hung up and bent on a stranger #

01:11:15.897 --> 01:11:20.067
#Just trying to swing a full-time ride #

01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:23.695
# I never knew the cold hand of danger #

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:26.615
# Till I met this one and took it inside #

01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:28.575
# Now I can't get near it #

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:30.827
Get a room! Really.
# Don't want to hear it #

01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:33.288
# My cover's blown #

01:11:33.373 --> 01:11:35.874
# I walked in the rain like a drone #

01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:38.126
# All the way to Marquette #

01:11:40.922 --> 01:11:42.881
# The infinite pet #

01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:46.510
# Oh, no #

01:11:47.512 --> 01:11:50.347
# No, no, no, no, no #

01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:52.724
# Cheaper than all your threats #

01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:55.268
# No, no ##
Shit.

01:11:55.353 --> 01:11:58.063
I've been calling you
every five minutes.
Are you okay?

01:11:58.189 --> 01:12:00.107
I'm great.
- What happened to you?

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:03.360
I don't wanna talk about it.
- You always wanna
talk about it.

01:12:03.486 --> 01:12:05.904
Not this.
- Okay. well, come on.
Let's go.

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:09.241
Where are we going?
- It's Thursday!

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:12.577
This one says, "Go for it!"

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:15.122
And this one says,
"You can do it!"

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:18.250
We have a whole line
of inspirational photographic cards...

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:20.460
featuring Pickles, my cat.

01:12:20.545 --> 01:12:23.380
I think people will really enjoy them.

01:12:23.464 --> 01:12:26.550
- Thank you.
- Good job, Rhoda.

01:12:26.634 --> 01:12:28.677
That's inspirational stuff.

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:31.346
Okay. Who's next?

01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:35.017
We haven't heard from
Sympathy in a while.

01:12:35.143 --> 01:12:36.768
Hansen?
- Yeah?

01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:39.604
The Winter Collection?
Do you have anything
to contribute?

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:41.732
Uh, no.

01:12:41.816 --> 01:12:43.734
I really don't.

01:12:43.818 --> 01:12:45.861
Okay.

01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:48.280
We'll come back to you.
Uh, McKenzie?

01:12:49.657 --> 01:12:52.159
Actually, you know what?
- Yes, Tom?

01:12:52.285 --> 01:12:55.120
Can I say something about the cat?
- Well, okay.

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:57.456
Yeah, uh, this is-

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.583
And, Rhoda, no disrespect here,

01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:03.253
but, um, this is total shit.

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:05.589
Tom!
"Go for it" and "You can do it"?

01:13:05.673 --> 01:13:07.799
That's not inspirational.
That's suicidal.

01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:10.844
If Pickles goes for it right there,
that's a dead cat.

01:13:10.928 --> 01:13:13.930
These are lies. we're liars.

01:13:14.015 --> 01:13:16.349
Think about it.
Why do people buy these things?

01:13:16.434 --> 01:13:18.769
It's not 'cause they want
to say how they feel.

01:13:18.853 --> 01:13:22.814
People buy cards 'cause
they can't say how they feel,
or they're afraid to.

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:25.317
We provide the service
that lets them off the hook.

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:28.945
You know what?
I say, to hell with it!
Let's level with America.

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:31.615
At least let them speak
for themselves! Right?

01:13:31.699 --> 01:13:34.910
I mean, look! What- what is this?
What does it say?

01:13:34.994 --> 01:13:36.912
"Congratulations
on your new baby." Right?

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:39.206
How 'bout, "Congratulations
on your new baby.

01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:42.542
- That's it for hanging out.
Nice knowing you."
- Sit down, Hansen.

01:13:42.627 --> 01:13:46.588
How 'bout this one, with all
the pretty hearts on the front?
I know where this is going. Yep!

01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:50.258
"Happy Valentine's Day,
sweetheart. I love you."

01:13:50.343 --> 01:13:53.845
That sweet? Ain't love grand?

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:56.098
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

01:13:56.182 --> 01:13:58.266
What does that even mean, "love"?

01:13:58.351 --> 01:14:01.144
Do you know? Do you? Anybody?

01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:02.646
Tom.

01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:05.732
If somebody gave me this card,
Mr. Vance, I would eat it.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:11.947
It's- It's these cards,
and the movies, and the pop songs-

01:14:12.031 --> 01:14:14.616
They're to blame for all the lies...

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:18.078
and the heartache, everything.

01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:20.914
And we're responsible.
I'm responsible.

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:26.795
I think we do a bad thing here.

01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:30.423
People should be able
to say how they feel-
how they really feel-

01:14:30.508 --> 01:14:34.636
not, you know, some words
that some strangers
put in their mouths.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.222
Words like "love"...

01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:42.519
that don't mean anything.

01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:45.897
Sorry. I'm sorry. I, uh-

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:50.443
I quit. I'm-

01:14:50.528 --> 01:14:53.113
There's enough bullshit
in the world without my help.

01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:21.391
All right. Next we do running drills.

01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:23.643
Hey, you're sketching again.

01:15:23.728 --> 01:15:25.937
Yeah, well, just doodling.

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:29.733
Okay, Tom. we got 20 seconds.
Talk to me. You okay?

01:15:29.817 --> 01:15:32.068
Yeah, I'm good. I'm great.

01:15:38.826 --> 01:15:41.369
You know, my friends
are all in love with you.

01:15:41.454 --> 01:15:43.371
You know, it's like we said.

01:15:43.497 --> 01:15:46.666
Plenty of other fish in the sea.
- Thanks.

01:15:46.751 --> 01:15:49.002
But, uh, those are guppies.

01:15:49.086 --> 01:15:51.004
Yeah.

01:15:51.088 --> 01:15:54.382
Hey, Tom?
- Mmm.

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:58.220
Look, I know you think
that she was the one,

01:15:59.472 --> 01:16:01.806
but I don't.

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:05.143
Now, I think you're just
remembering the good stuff.

01:16:05.228 --> 01:16:08.230
Next time you look back, I, uh-

01:16:08.314 --> 01:16:10.815
I really think
you should look again.

01:16:48.062 --> 01:16:51.690
It's playing at 5:00.
Do you wanna see it?

01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:55.735
Um, I don't know.
We could just go back
to your place or-

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:58.655
No, I really want to see it.
Let's go.

01:17:17.883 --> 01:17:21.261
# Time it was and what a time it was #

01:17:21.345 --> 01:17:23.263
# It was #

01:17:24.724 --> 01:17:28.184
# A time of innocence #

01:17:28.269 --> 01:17:31.313
# A time of confidences #

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:34.357
You okay?
- Yeah.

01:17:34.442 --> 01:17:37.610
What- what is it?
The movie?

01:17:37.695 --> 01:17:40.447
It's nothing. I'm just-
I'm just being stupid.

01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:42.157
Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:17:42.241 --> 01:17:47.287
# Preserve your memories
They're all that's left you ##

01:17:48.456 --> 01:17:50.457
It pains me we live in a world...

01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:52.625
where nobody's heard
of Spearmint.

01:17:52.752 --> 01:17:55.962
I've never heard of them.
- I put 'em on that mix
I made you.

01:17:56.047 --> 01:17:58.340
They're track one.

01:17:58.424 --> 01:18:00.759
Oh, yeah.

01:18:27.161 --> 01:18:29.788
So, what do you wanna do?

01:18:29.872 --> 01:18:32.123
I think I'm just gonna
call it a day.

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.793
You don't wanna
get some dinner?
Are you hungry?

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:39.047
You all right?

01:18:40.174 --> 01:18:42.801
I'm just tired.
- Okay.

01:18:54.438 --> 01:18:57.440
I got it. Pancakes!

01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:37.021
# oh, girl, I don't know
all the reasons why #

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:42.026
# I found the answer
looking in your eye #

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:46.739
# I go out walking all day long #

01:19:46.824 --> 01:19:51.202
# Take away this lonely man
Soon he will be gone #

01:19:51.287 --> 01:19:53.621
# 'Cause I'll tell you everything #

01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:57.375
# About living free #

01:20:00.671 --> 01:20:03.298
# Yes, I can see you, girl #

01:20:03.382 --> 01:20:07.051
# Can you see me #

01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:15.518
# You don't need to know
what I do all day #

01:20:15.603 --> 01:20:20.064
# It's as much as I know
watch it waste away #

01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:22.525
# 'Cause I'll tell you everything #

01:20:22.610 --> 01:20:26.696
# About living free #

01:20:28.449 --> 01:20:32.410
# Yes, I can see you, girl #

01:20:32.495 --> 01:20:37.790
# Can you see me #

01:21:01.899 --> 01:21:04.234
# 'Cause I'll tell you everything #

01:21:04.318 --> 01:21:08.112
# About being free ##

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:49.988
Hey, Tom.

01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:06.671
I thought I might see you here.

01:22:13.387 --> 01:22:16.723
I always loved this place,
ever since you brought me.

01:22:16.807 --> 01:22:19.475
So I, uh-

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.894
I guess I should say
congratulations.

01:22:23.522 --> 01:22:25.481
Only if you mean it.

01:22:25.566 --> 01:22:28.359
Ah. Well, in that case-

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.994
So, are you okay?

01:22:38.078 --> 01:22:41.122
I will be, eventually.

01:22:41.206 --> 01:22:43.583
You wanna-
- Hmm.

01:22:46.879 --> 01:22:49.005
I like your suit.
- Ah, thanks.

01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:51.382
You look sharp.

01:22:51.508 --> 01:22:54.552
So do you.
Thanks.

01:22:54.637 --> 01:22:57.138
I quit the office.
- You did?

01:22:57.222 --> 01:22:59.557
I didn't know. That's great!

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:03.227
And you, um-

01:23:04.271 --> 01:23:06.189
you're married.

01:23:06.273 --> 01:23:08.941
Yeah. It's crazy, huh?

01:23:17.368 --> 01:23:21.329
You should have told me
when we were at the-
I know.

01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:23.748
You know, at the wedding
when we were dancing.

01:23:23.874 --> 01:23:26.292
Well, he hadn't asked me yet.
But he was in your life.

01:23:26.418 --> 01:23:29.128
Yeah.
- So why'd you dance with me?

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.175
'Cause I wanted to.

01:23:36.095 --> 01:23:39.097
You just do what you want,
don't you?

01:23:46.313 --> 01:23:48.648
You never wanted to be
anybody's girlfriend,

01:23:48.732 --> 01:23:50.983
and now you're somebody's wife.

01:23:51.068 --> 01:23:53.152
Surprised me too.

01:23:53.237 --> 01:23:56.030
I don't think I'll ever
understand that.

01:23:57.449 --> 01:24:00.118
I mean,
it doesn't make sense.

01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:03.579
It just happened.

01:24:03.664 --> 01:24:07.542
Right, but that's what
I don't understand.
What just happened?

01:24:07.626 --> 01:24:11.963
I just- I just woke up one day,
and I knew.

01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:13.965
Knew what?

01:24:16.301 --> 01:24:18.803
What I was never sure of with you.

01:24:32.985 --> 01:24:34.986
You know what sucks?

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:38.448
Realizing that everything
you believe in is complete
and utter bullshit.

01:24:38.532 --> 01:24:40.533
It sucks.
- What do you mean?

01:24:40.617 --> 01:24:44.579
Uh, you know, destiny,
and soul mates, and true love,

01:24:44.663 --> 01:24:49.333
and all that childhood
fairy tale nonsense.

01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:51.711
You were right.
I- I should have listened to you.

01:24:51.837 --> 01:24:55.298
No.
- Yeah. what?
What are you smiling at?

01:24:56.508 --> 01:24:58.968
Tom.
- What?

01:25:00.637 --> 01:25:03.389
What are you looking at me
like that for?

01:25:03.474 --> 01:25:06.100
Well, you know,

01:25:06.185 --> 01:25:08.394
I guess it's 'cause...

01:25:08.479 --> 01:25:11.022
I was sitting in a deli
and reading Dorian Gray

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:13.608
and... a guy comes up to me...

01:25:13.692 --> 01:25:16.277
and asked me about it,

01:25:16.361 --> 01:25:19.363
and... now he's my husband.

01:25:22.201 --> 01:25:24.660
Yeah. And... so?

01:25:24.745 --> 01:25:28.623
So, what if I'd gone to the movies?

01:25:28.707 --> 01:25:33.628
What if I had gone
somewhere else for lunch?

01:25:33.712 --> 01:25:37.048
What if I'd gotten there
10 minutes later?

01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:40.635
It was-

01:25:40.719 --> 01:25:43.054
It was meant to be.

01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:45.807
And I just kept thinking,

01:25:47.559 --> 01:25:49.560
Tom was right.
- No.

01:25:49.645 --> 01:25:51.729
Yeah, I did.

01:25:51.814 --> 01:25:54.315
I did.

01:26:00.948 --> 01:26:03.533
It just wasn't me
that you were right about.

01:26:30.102 --> 01:26:32.019
I should go.

01:26:32.104 --> 01:26:35.106
But I'm really happy to see
that you're doing well.

01:26:42.573 --> 01:26:44.574
Summer!

01:26:46.577 --> 01:26:48.786
I really do hope
that you're happy.

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:25.740
Most days of the year
are unremarkable.

01:27:25.824 --> 01:27:28.910
They begin and they end...

01:27:28.994 --> 01:27:32.914
with no lasting memories
made in between.

01:27:32.998 --> 01:27:35.541
Most days have no impact...

01:27:35.626 --> 01:27:37.627
on the course of a life.

01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:41.505
May 23 was a Wednesday.

01:27:59.274 --> 01:28:02.193
Are you interviewing?
- Sorry?

01:28:02.277 --> 01:28:05.905
Are you interviewing
for the position?

01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:08.532
Oh, yeah. why? Are you?
- Yeah.

01:28:08.617 --> 01:28:10.534
Mm-hmm.

01:28:10.619 --> 01:28:12.745
My competition.

01:28:12.829 --> 01:28:15.498
It would appear.

01:28:15.582 --> 01:28:19.752
Yeah. So, a little awkward.

01:28:19.836 --> 01:28:21.754
Yeah.

01:28:22.798 --> 01:28:27.718
Well, I hope you, um,
don't get the job.

01:28:27.803 --> 01:28:31.305
Well, I hope you
don't get the job.

01:28:33.433 --> 01:28:36.268
Have I seen you before?

01:28:36.353 --> 01:28:38.354
Me? I don't think so.

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:42.149
Do you ever go
to Angelus Plaza?

01:28:42.234 --> 01:28:45.152
Yes. That's, like,
my favorite spot in the city.

01:28:45.237 --> 01:28:47.196
Yeah. Okay. Except for
the parking lots, but-

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:49.198
Yeah. I- I agree.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:51.325
I think I've seen you there.
- Really?

01:28:51.451 --> 01:28:54.286
Yeah.
- I haven't seen you.

01:28:56.039 --> 01:28:58.666
You must not
have been looking.

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:00.751
If Tom had learned anything,

01:29:00.836 --> 01:29:03.879
it was that you can't ascribe
great cosmic significance...

01:29:03.964 --> 01:29:06.090
to a simple earthly event.

01:29:07.759 --> 01:29:11.721
Coincidence.
That's all anything ever is.

01:29:11.805 --> 01:29:13.806
Nothing more than coincidence.

01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:16.225
Tom Hansen.
- Yeah.

01:29:16.309 --> 01:29:18.310
Come on back.
- Thank you.

01:29:19.604 --> 01:29:23.607
Tom had finally learned
there are no miracles.

01:29:23.692 --> 01:29:26.193
There's no such thing as fate.

01:29:26.278 --> 01:29:28.696
Nothing is meant to be.

01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:32.366
He knew. He was sure of it now.

01:29:32.451 --> 01:29:35.119
Tom was-
- Sorry. Um-

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:37.413
I just left, uh-
Can I- one second.

01:29:37.497 --> 01:29:40.249
He was pretty sure.

01:29:40.333 --> 01:29:43.419
- Hey.
- You again.

01:29:43.503 --> 01:29:45.838
Yeah. I, uh, was just wondering...

01:29:45.922 --> 01:29:49.175
if maybe after this, if, um, you-

01:29:51.094 --> 01:29:53.721
you want to get some coffee
or something.

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:55.806
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:29:55.891 --> 01:29:59.935
I'm sort of supposed to
meet someone after this.

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:01.979
Okay.

01:30:09.321 --> 01:30:11.197
Sure.

01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:13.908
What's that?
Why not?

01:30:13.992 --> 01:30:17.244
Okay. Well, then I'll just, uh-
I'll wait for you-

01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:19.538
We- We'll figure it out.
We'll figure it out.

01:30:19.623 --> 01:30:23.834
- My name's Tom.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Autumn.

01:30:39.518 --> 01:30:43.145
# She's got you high
and you don't even know yet #

01:30:43.230 --> 01:30:46.732
# She's got you high
and you don't even know yet #

01:30:46.817 --> 01:30:50.402
# The sun's in the sky
It's warming up your bare legs #

01:30:50.487 --> 01:30:54.115
# And you can't deny
you're looking for the sunset #
