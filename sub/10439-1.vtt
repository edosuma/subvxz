00:51.108 --> 00:55.011
My darling Freddie.

00:55.012 --> 00:57.814
A moment ago I knew
exactly what I wanted

00:57.815 --> 01:01.785
to say to you.

01:01.786 --> 01:07.791
I have run through this letter
in my mind so very often and...

01:07.792 --> 01:09.926
...I wanted to
compose something

01:09.927 --> 01:13.063
eloquent but...

01:13.064 --> 01:17.901
...the words just don't seem to
be there.

01:17.902 --> 01:22.338
I think that's because, this time, I...

01:22.339 --> 01:25.302
...really do want to die.

07:26.302 --> 07:31.207
I really mean it.
It's not just a line.

07:31.208 --> 07:35.732
I really think you're the most
attractive girl I've met.

07:56.732 --> 07:58.834
- Hester?
- Hello.

07:58.835 --> 08:00.671
- How are you?
- Well, thank you. You?

08:00.672 --> 08:03.372
Very well, thank you.
What brings you to...

08:03.373 --> 08:04.507
I was just...

08:04.508 --> 08:07.709
I survived the battle of
britain, old fruit, old darling.

08:07.710 --> 08:09.678
Survived.

08:09.679 --> 08:14.416
The mixture of fear and excitement...

08:14.417 --> 08:17.286
there's nothing like it.

08:17.287 --> 08:21.224
Excitement and fear.

08:21.225 --> 08:26.595
Irresistible combo.

08:26.596 --> 08:29.232
We were doing something important...

08:29.233 --> 08:32.368
for dear old Blighty.

08:32.369 --> 08:35.537
Old fruit...

08:35.538 --> 08:38.765
...old darling.

10:42.766 --> 10:46.571
Mrs. Page?

10:47.571 --> 10:50.605
Mrs. Page?

10:50.606 --> 10:55.011
Mrs. Page?!

10:55.012 --> 10:57.859
Mrs. Page!

11:08.859 --> 11:13.863
Mr. Miller?

11:13.864 --> 11:17.900
Can you come up, please?
It's urgent.

11:17.901 --> 11:20.375
How many?!

11:26.375 --> 11:30.079
Twelve.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.776
Get me a bowl.

12:32.776 --> 12:37.379
- Is there anything we can do?
- There's nothing you can do.

12:37.380 --> 12:39.114
You don't mean she's dying?

12:39.115 --> 12:40.782
On the contrary.

12:40.783 --> 12:43.685
But she did try to kill
herself, didn't she?

12:43.686 --> 12:47.156
It would seem so.

12:47.157 --> 12:48.491
She'll recover?

12:48.492 --> 12:53.595
60 grains of aspirin are hardly
enough to kill a healthy child.

12:53.596 --> 12:57.532
The symptoms of gas
poisoning are very slight.

12:57.533 --> 13:01.002
Do you think she'll try again, doctor?

13:01.003 --> 13:03.171
I'm not a doctor.

13:03.172 --> 13:07.843
But I will say she will
probably try again.

13:07.844 --> 13:11.613
Isn't attempted suicide a crime?

13:11.614 --> 13:13.882
Don't people go to jail for it?

13:13.883 --> 13:16.719
People go to jail for
all sorts of reasons.

13:16.720 --> 13:19.973
- Shall we call the police?
- No!

13:36.973 --> 13:38.854
Don't you think you
should just stay in bed?

13:50.854 --> 13:56.224
No, I just...
I just feel a bit...

13:56.225 --> 13:59.101
...dopey, that's all.

14:06.101 --> 14:10.672
I'm terribly sorry...

14:10.673 --> 14:12.718
...for all the trouble I've caused.

14:21.718 --> 14:25.020
Are you sure you're all right?

14:25.021 --> 14:27.790
Yes.

14:27.791 --> 14:29.968
Thank you.

14:37.968 --> 14:42.671
Mr. Miller... I don't like to
ask, you've been so good...

14:42.672 --> 14:44.575
...but can you come down and
see Mr. Elton later?

14:45.575 --> 14:47.176
He's not well again.

14:47.177 --> 14:48.810
Of course.

14:48.811 --> 14:53.081
And, Mr. Welch, don't forget
to pick up your post

14:53.082 --> 14:55.117
on your way out.

14:55.118 --> 14:57.836
Thank you, Mrs. Elton.

15:13.836 --> 15:17.772
Mrs. Elton.

15:17.773 --> 15:22.877
Please don't say anything
to Mr. Page about my...

15:22.878 --> 15:25.550
...idiotic accident.

15:26.550 --> 15:29.118
I don't want to alarm him.

15:29.119 --> 15:33.722
If that's the way you want it.

15:33.723 --> 15:35.723
Yes... please.

15:39.729 --> 15:41.773
That's the way I want it.

16:23.773 --> 16:26.141
Stop! That man there!

16:26.142 --> 16:29.277
Just back from giving Jerry a
damn good thrashing, sir.

16:29.278 --> 16:30.245
Good show, Page.

16:30.246 --> 16:31.447
Had to ditch the crate in
the drink, though.

16:31.448 --> 16:36.819
No fuel, no ammo left but was
still a whizzo prang, sir.

16:36.820 --> 16:40.155
- Carry on.
- Can I do you now, sir?

16:40.156 --> 16:42.624
They'll do the Navy now.

16:42.625 --> 16:45.627
Range 2,000 and closing fast, number one.

16:45.628 --> 16:46.763
- Stand by torps!
- Torps ready, sir.

16:46.764 --> 16:49.131
- Fire one!
- Fire one.

16:49.132 --> 16:49.832
- Fire two!
- Fire two.

16:49.833 --> 16:52.267
We hit her amidships, sir.

16:52.268 --> 16:54.870
Very good.
Stand by to pick up survivors.

16:54.871 --> 16:57.139
All right, you two, come down to earth.

16:57.140 --> 16:59.208
I say, kitten.

16:59.209 --> 17:01.776
Humor them, for God's sake,
otherwise we'll get a replay

17:01.777 --> 17:03.411
of the entire war.

17:03.412 --> 17:05.751
Very well, then.

17:08.751 --> 17:12.253
That's all we need, sound effects.

17:12.255 --> 17:15.391
You've gone all frosty, kitten.

17:15.392 --> 17:17.759
Is it agony?
One does hope so.

17:17.760 --> 17:20.295
If it gets too cold you could always rub

17:20.296 --> 17:22.230
two boy scouts together.

17:22.231 --> 17:25.867
Drinks, gentlemen.
The ladies are thirsty.

17:25.867 --> 17:28.440
Parched.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.985
I love you so much.

17:41.985 --> 17:43.855
We'll have less of that.

17:46.855 --> 17:50.191
They can't ration everything.

17:50.192 --> 17:52.031
No.

17:56.031 --> 17:59.767
Come on... let's go home.

17:59.768 --> 18:02.310
Yes.

18:41.310 --> 18:43.478
Do the right thing.

18:43.479 --> 18:45.913
Go back to your husband.

18:45.914 --> 18:48.917
Father, I came to you for advice.

18:48.918 --> 18:52.054
I've given it to you.

18:52.055 --> 18:54.757
For support, then.

18:54.758 --> 18:57.258
From you.

18:57.259 --> 19:02.029
From your heart.

19:02.030 --> 19:04.900
You have a husband.

19:04.901 --> 19:07.773
Your first loyalty is to him.

19:09.773 --> 19:14.509
Twin beds.
Again.

19:14.510 --> 19:19.014
Mother has an arcane view of
married life.

19:19.015 --> 19:21.083
How were you conceived, then?

19:21.084 --> 19:22.785
Willpower?

19:22.786 --> 19:28.824
Don't be vulgar, Hester.
We are talking about mummy.

19:28.825 --> 19:31.564
It's not that bad.

19:34.564 --> 19:37.038
Just don't let her rile you.

19:43.038 --> 19:44.472
Mother?

19:44.473 --> 19:45.978
No.

19:48.978 --> 19:50.902
Thank you.

20:12.902 --> 20:14.938
Will you be going to
Wimbledon this year, mother?

20:14.939 --> 20:19.274
No, since your father's
death I've not been

20:19.275 --> 20:21.846
able to enjoy tennis.

20:23.846 --> 20:26.319
Do you play?

20:30.319 --> 20:31.987
Tennis?

20:31.988 --> 20:33.560
Anything.

20:38.560 --> 20:42.898
I occasionally play a hand at canasta.

20:42.899 --> 20:46.005
Cards are a pastime.
I meant a sport.

20:49.005 --> 20:52.274
I've always thought of sport
as one of the more pointless

20:52.275 --> 20:54.379
of human activities.

20:56.379 --> 20:59.052
That was almost offensive.

21:03.052 --> 21:05.594
I'm sure Hester didn't mean
to be impolite, mother.

21:11.594 --> 21:14.566
I take it you don't play, then?

21:17.566 --> 21:19.634
Occasionally.

21:19.635 --> 21:24.105
I just find it very hard to be
passionate about it.

21:24.106 --> 21:25.575
Beware of passion, Hester.

21:26.575 --> 21:33.148
It always leads to something ugly.

21:33.149 --> 21:38.019
What would you replace it with?

21:38.020 --> 21:43.624
A guarded enthusiasm.

21:43.625 --> 21:47.371
It's safer.

21:55.371 --> 21:58.134
But much duller.

22:26.134 --> 22:28.703
The garden really is glorious, even at

22:28.704 --> 22:30.272
this time of year.

22:30.273 --> 22:34.078
Yes.
It's my one unalloyed pleasure.

22:36.078 --> 22:38.651
So much safer than people,
don't you think?

22:41.651 --> 22:46.489
No, not in the long run.

22:47.489 --> 22:49.464
Ah, tea.

22:55.464 --> 22:56.469
There.

22:59.469 --> 23:02.336
No, darling.
Hester will pour.

23:02.337 --> 23:04.276
Won't you, dear?

23:07.276 --> 23:08.584
If you wish.

23:14.584 --> 23:18.319
You've put the milk in first.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.421
Would you rather I hadn't?

23:20.422 --> 23:24.608
No, I'm sure it'll still
be very refreshing.

23:39.608 --> 23:42.244
The garden is really lovely, mother.

23:42.245 --> 23:45.313
Yes, even Hester has been admiring it.

23:45.314 --> 23:49.492
Almost passionately.

23:57.492 --> 23:59.227
Would you like a cake, mother?

23:59.228 --> 24:02.064
Oh, yes.
The Battenberg.

24:02.065 --> 24:04.806
It's a pleasure I've never outgrown.

24:10.806 --> 24:13.775
Is there anything you
haven't outgrown, Hester?

24:13.776 --> 24:18.447
Yes!
Insensitivity.

24:18.448 --> 24:22.316
I've never been able to forgive it.

24:22.317 --> 24:24.419
Darling, I'm going upstairs to pack.

24:24.420 --> 24:26.701
I'd like to get an early
start back to town.

24:39.701 --> 24:42.304
I'm hoping we'll be
leaving for London soon.

24:42.305 --> 24:43.873
All right, I'll see you at the grapes.

24:43.874 --> 24:46.208
No. No, not there.

24:46.209 --> 24:48.276
I'll meet you at Jackie Jackson's.

24:48.277 --> 24:51.113
- Come back soon.
- As soon as I can, Freddie.

24:51.114 --> 24:53.782
- Oh, darling.
- Darling.

24:53.783 --> 24:57.624
- Love you.
- Me, too.

25:02.624 --> 25:07.739
And who else do you call darling?

25:16.739 --> 25:20.480
I assume this means what I think it means?

25:25.480 --> 25:27.885
Well, how long?

25:29.885 --> 25:31.152
William.

25:31.153 --> 25:34.161
How long has this been going on?

25:38.161 --> 25:40.864
For some months.

25:42.864 --> 25:44.538
I see.

25:49.538 --> 25:52.707
I'll meet you at the car after
I've said goodbye to mother.

25:52.708 --> 25:57.478
I don't want her upset unnecessarily.

25:57.479 --> 26:01.416
And that way, at least our
dignity will remain intact.

26:34.416 --> 26:35.790
William.

26:41.790 --> 26:45.326
Shall we send everything to
your chambers, sir William?

26:45.327 --> 26:47.528
Yes, Lincoln's inn.

26:47.529 --> 26:49.597
But I'll take the wig tin with me now.

26:49.598 --> 26:50.951
Good day, sir William.

27:42.951 --> 27:44.786
Do you realize what you're doing?

27:44.787 --> 27:48.023
Yes, William.

27:48.024 --> 27:49.891
I do.

27:49.892 --> 27:51.825
It's just a sordid little affair.

27:51.826 --> 27:53.631
No, it's not.
I love him.

27:55.631 --> 27:57.032
It's infatuation.

27:57.033 --> 28:00.035
There's more to love than... physicality.

28:00.036 --> 28:02.804
Well, there isn't for me any more.

28:02.805 --> 28:05.710
You can drop me here, Flitton.

28:08.710 --> 28:11.578
- I won't consent to a divorce.
- Bill.

28:11.579 --> 28:14.082
I intend to make it as
difficult as possible for you.

28:14.083 --> 28:16.450
You sound exactly like my father.

28:16.451 --> 28:19.453
- What do you mean?
- That tone of voice.

28:19.454 --> 28:24.426
That same mixture of irritation
and sanctimoniousness.

28:24.427 --> 28:26.494
It's hard enough when it
comes from a vicar,

28:26.495 --> 28:28.935
but when it comes from
you it's insufferable!

28:33.935 --> 28:35.636
I'm sorry, William.

28:35.637 --> 28:39.477
I didn't mean for that to
sound as spiteful as it did.

28:41.477 --> 28:45.580
How can you throw away
so much for so little?

28:45.581 --> 28:47.218
I didn't think it was going to be easy.

28:47.549 --> 28:50.091
Was it so hard to stay and continue?

28:55.091 --> 28:59.393
Yes, William...

28:59.394 --> 29:00.797
...it is.

29:02.797 --> 29:04.798
Shall I come into dinner with you?

29:04.799 --> 29:08.074
In the circumstances, I think not.

29:12.074 --> 29:15.047
I'll never give you a divorce.

29:18.047 --> 29:20.552
I never want to see you again.

29:23.552 --> 29:25.652
You may call for me at
about 10:45, Flitton.

29:25.653 --> 29:28.123
You may take lady Collyer to...

29:28.124 --> 29:31.097
...wherever it is she wishes to go.

30:09.097 --> 30:11.833
Morning, Mrs. E.

30:11.834 --> 30:13.767
Still doing post duty?

30:13.768 --> 30:17.538
Saves time, especially in the mornings.

30:17.539 --> 30:21.075
My tenants can pick up their
letters on their way to work.

30:21.076 --> 30:24.478
You're a treasure, Mrs. E.

30:24.479 --> 30:27.481
It's all part of the service.

30:27.482 --> 30:29.717
Go right up.

30:29.718 --> 30:33.156
Second floor, front.
Bit of a hike.

30:35.156 --> 30:36.790
Post, Mrs. Page.

30:36.791 --> 30:40.161
- Mrs. Page?
- Yes?

30:40.162 --> 30:41.728
Post.

30:41.729 --> 30:43.701
Oh, yes.

30:45.701 --> 30:48.204
Thank you.

31:23.204 --> 31:25.711
You'll make it look cosy in no time.

31:29.711 --> 31:32.816
Thank you, Jackie, that was terrific.

31:33.816 --> 31:36.892
Good afternoon, Mrs. Elton.

31:42.892 --> 31:44.731
How's tricks, Hes?

31:49.731 --> 31:54.268
I have just done 93 down the great west.

31:54.269 --> 31:56.036
In an Alvis.

31:56.037 --> 31:57.838
Smashing job.

31:57.839 --> 32:00.649
Jackie Jackson gave me a lift.

32:06.649 --> 32:08.721
Well, let's have a bit of
light on the subject.

32:13.721 --> 32:16.591
Christ.

32:16.592 --> 32:18.799
Let's have something
with a bit of life in it.

32:24.799 --> 32:29.304
- Did you have a good weekend?
- Not bad.

32:29.305 --> 32:34.308
I won both my matches.
Took a fiver off Jackie.

32:34.309 --> 32:37.010
He was livid!

32:37.011 --> 32:42.784
And then it started raining
so golf kaput.

32:42.785 --> 32:45.920
How much did you win altogether?

32:45.921 --> 32:47.691
Seven.

32:49.691 --> 32:52.794
Can I have some of it for the rent?

32:52.795 --> 32:56.998
Oh, hell.
All right, you can have 3.

32:56.999 --> 32:59.200
But I need the rest for lunch.

32:59.201 --> 33:02.903
A job prospect.
South American.

33:02.904 --> 33:06.140
The DFC and bar seems
to have impressed him.

33:06.141 --> 33:11.712
- What South American?
- A bloke I met at golf.

33:11.713 --> 33:14.756
Do you know you've not looked
at me since I came in?

33:20.756 --> 33:24.398
I know what you look like, Freddie.

33:29.398 --> 33:33.178
I've done something, haven't I?

33:43.178 --> 33:45.097
Oh God.

34:02.097 --> 34:03.782
Many happy returns.

34:19.782 --> 34:21.851
Had you arranged something special?

34:23.851 --> 34:26.864
Just steak and a bottle of claret.

34:35.864 --> 34:37.239
I'm sorry.

34:46.239 --> 34:46.782
Come on.

34:53.782 --> 34:57.484
I'm sorry.

34:57.485 --> 34:58.858
I'm so sorry.

35:02.858 --> 35:06.127
I can't say any more, can I?

35:06.128 --> 35:09.029
No...

35:09.030 --> 35:12.076
...you can't.

35:21.076 --> 35:25.747
- Do you still love me?
- Yes.

35:25.748 --> 35:26.885
Yes.

35:29.885 --> 35:31.907
I still love you.

35:52.907 --> 35:54.552
I need a cigarette.

36:03.552 --> 36:06.157
Freddie, give that to me.

36:08.157 --> 36:09.795
It's addressed to me.

36:13.795 --> 36:17.137
I beg you not to read it.

36:22.137 --> 36:23.554
It's addressed to me.

36:39.554 --> 36:42.539
Forgive me.

36:57.539 --> 36:59.076
Freddie.

37:01.076 --> 37:04.615
Freddie!
Freddie!

37:39.615 --> 37:42.385
William?

37:43.385 --> 37:46.587
How did you know I was here?

37:46.588 --> 37:49.457
Your landlady telephoned me.

37:49.458 --> 37:52.993
I'm sorry but I was worried about you.

37:52.994 --> 37:54.328
I see.

37:54.329 --> 37:56.129
Tell her to go.

37:56.130 --> 37:58.646
It's all right, mrs Elton.
Thank you.

38:10.646 --> 38:14.582
How did she find you?

38:14.583 --> 38:17.384
I'm still in the telephone directory.

38:17.385 --> 38:18.956
I assume she used her initiative.

38:21.956 --> 38:25.360
I'm flattered you came.

38:26.360 --> 38:28.129
Don't be.

38:28.130 --> 38:31.531
My motives were entirely selfish.

38:31.532 --> 38:34.249
I was hoping to gloat.

38:47.249 --> 38:49.683
Are you all right?

38:49.684 --> 38:57.158
You ought to be in bed.
Let me look at you.

38:57.159 --> 39:00.493
Tongue.

39:00.494 --> 39:02.663
You should live to a ripe old age.

39:02.664 --> 39:05.966
- Are you her doctor?
- No.

39:05.967 --> 39:08.636
What are you, then?

39:08.637 --> 39:14.709
Shall we just say that
he is a philanthropist.

39:14.710 --> 39:17.712
A little more respect
might not come amiss.

39:17.713 --> 39:19.648
I give my respect to
those who've earned it.

39:19.649 --> 39:22.621
To everyone else, I'm civil.

39:26.621 --> 39:29.726
I take it he's not a qualified
medical practitioner?

39:31.726 --> 39:36.474
You take it quite correctly.

39:45.474 --> 39:47.512
So what happened?

39:50.512 --> 39:54.448
I must be careful what I say.

39:54.449 --> 39:58.319
Attempted suicide is a crime, isn't it?

39:58.320 --> 39:59.719
Yes.

39:59.720 --> 40:02.288
And I am speaking to a judge.

40:02.289 --> 40:04.331
You're speaking to your husband.

40:09.331 --> 40:12.433
Why didn't you let me know
you were back in London?

40:12.434 --> 40:13.801
The last time I saw you,

40:13.802 --> 40:17.538
you said never wanted to
hear from me again.

40:17.539 --> 40:20.050
The last time I saw you I
didn't know what I was saying.

40:28.050 --> 40:29.482
Has he deserted you?

40:29.483 --> 40:32.724
No, he just got back from Sunningdale.

40:35.724 --> 40:40.227
Do you still play?

40:40.228 --> 40:42.430
I don't go to Sunningdale any more.

40:42.431 --> 40:46.466
You used to love golf.
What do you do for exercise?

40:46.467 --> 40:48.606
I play tennis with David, occasionally.

40:51.606 --> 40:55.679
Has he become very pompous since
being made solicitor general?

40:57.679 --> 41:01.781
All solicitors general are pompous.

41:01.782 --> 41:03.822
Helps their game.

41:06.822 --> 41:08.689
Is he being unfaithful to you?

41:08.690 --> 41:09.756
No.

41:09.757 --> 41:15.261
He still loves you?

41:15.262 --> 41:18.237
As much as he did 10 months ago.

41:22.237 --> 41:25.439
And you still love him?

41:25.440 --> 41:27.849
Yes, William, I still love him.

41:34.849 --> 41:38.852
Is it money?

41:38.853 --> 41:41.168
Sit down, Bill.

41:53.168 --> 41:54.644
It's nice to see you again.

42:03.644 --> 42:06.383
I'm glad you still wear it.

42:09.383 --> 42:11.454
Yes.

42:13.454 --> 42:15.855
As yet I've taken no steps
so you can have the

42:15.856 --> 42:18.359
divorce if you still want it.

42:18.360 --> 42:21.499
That's generous of you, Bill.

42:24.499 --> 42:27.701
Can I do anything to help?

42:27.702 --> 42:29.681
No.

42:39.681 --> 42:43.350
Well...

42:43.351 --> 42:45.886
...at least I've found you again.

42:45.887 --> 42:48.622
- Did you look very hard?
- No.

42:48.623 --> 42:52.792
I rather foolishly thought
that my indifference

42:52.793 --> 42:54.704
would hurt your vanity.

43:03.704 --> 43:06.809
Did you really try to kill yourself?

43:08.809 --> 43:13.614
Whilst the balance of my
mind was disturbed.

43:13.615 --> 43:16.817
Isn't that the legal phrase?

43:16.818 --> 43:18.992
Yes, and what disturbed that balance?

43:23.992 --> 43:29.730
Anger, hatred, shame.

43:29.731 --> 43:31.799
Of myself.

43:31.800 --> 43:33.708
Of being alive.

43:40.708 --> 43:42.743
- Are you still angry?
- At Page?

43:42.744 --> 43:46.879
- At both of us.
- Yes.

43:46.880 --> 43:50.786
He betrayed my friendship.
You betrayed my trust.

43:52.786 --> 43:57.424
But anger fades and...

43:57.425 --> 43:59.632
...is replaced by regret.

44:04.632 --> 44:07.901
You said just now that his
feelings for you hadn't changed.

44:07.902 --> 44:10.738
They haven't.

44:10.739 --> 44:13.741
But zero minus zero is still zero.

44:13.742 --> 44:18.444
How long have you known this?

44:18.445 --> 44:21.415
From the beginning.

44:21.416 --> 44:27.620
How in the name of reason can
you go on loving a man

44:27.621 --> 44:28.822
who can give you nothing?

44:28.823 --> 44:33.527
But he does give me something...
from time to time.

44:33.528 --> 44:34.627
What?

44:34.628 --> 44:37.505
Himself.

44:43.505 --> 44:46.073
For someone like me whose...

44:46.074 --> 44:50.944
...profession is the study of
human nature, I'm...

44:50.945 --> 44:52.751
...very inexperienced in
matters of this kind.

44:56.751 --> 45:03.089
So am I, Bill, so am I.

45:03.090 --> 45:06.326
Blame my conventional upbringing.

45:06.327 --> 45:09.495
I was brought up to believe
that in matters of this kind...

45:09.496 --> 45:12.041
...it was more proper for the
man to do the loving.

45:20.041 --> 45:23.349
I wish you'd try to find a
way I could help.

45:27.349 --> 45:29.791
I'll try and find a way.

45:37.791 --> 45:43.430
- This is a tragedy.
- Tragedy is too big a word.

45:43.431 --> 45:46.773
Sad perhaps, but hardly sophocles.

45:52.773 --> 45:57.643
If we'd been able to have a child...

45:57.644 --> 45:59.621
...would it have made
any difference?

46:06.621 --> 46:07.768
To whom?

46:24.139 --> 46:26.707
Many happy returns of yesterday.

46:26.708 --> 46:29.467

Just because I forgot
her bloody birthday!

48:52.052 --> 48:55.221
My God!

48:55.222 --> 48:57.957
If all the men who forgot their
wives' birthdays were to come

48:57.958 --> 48:59.258
home to suicide notes...

48:59.561 --> 49:01.262
...the line would stretch from
here to the shetlands.

49:01.263 --> 49:02.828
- Can I have the letter?
- Why?!

49:02.829 --> 49:05.799
- It belongs to me!
- It had my name on it.

49:05.800 --> 49:09.201
My God, aren't women the end?

49:09.202 --> 49:11.172
Marries the first man who asks her...

49:11.173 --> 49:14.975
...and falls in love with the
first man who gives her the eye.

49:14.976 --> 49:17.343
Look, Freddie, I think
you two ought to talk.

49:17.344 --> 49:18.378
I'll disappear.

49:18.379 --> 49:20.146
I've got a whole bloody
lifetime to talk to her!

49:20.147 --> 49:23.283
You stay.
Freddie.

49:23.284 --> 49:26.018
Come home with me, please.

49:26.019 --> 49:29.221
That cool, calm and collected act.

49:29.222 --> 49:30.623
Do you see it?

49:30.624 --> 49:32.360
It always works so
bloody well because it's

49:32.361 --> 49:34.794
always so bloody lethal.

49:34.795 --> 49:39.031
I know that I'm going to die!

49:39.032 --> 49:41.701
Just accept that it isn't your fault.

49:41.702 --> 49:43.036
It really isn't, Freddie.

49:43.037 --> 49:44.638
You can't help who you are.

49:44.639 --> 49:46.138
I can't help what I am.

49:46.139 --> 49:48.342
Well, I'm not carrying the
can for this old darling.

49:48.343 --> 49:49.643
No dice.

49:49.644 --> 49:50.976
I'm not the villain of the piece.

49:50.977 --> 49:52.079
No one is saying you are!

49:52.080 --> 49:55.881
Haven't you read what I wrote?
I'm not blaming you!

49:55.882 --> 49:59.319
I was the one who wanted
to wait for the divorce.

49:59.320 --> 50:00.386
You didn't.

50:00.387 --> 50:01.755
You jumped that particular fence.

50:01.756 --> 50:04.390
I never gave myself a big build-up.

50:04.391 --> 50:06.393
You knew exactly what you were getting.

50:06.394 --> 50:08.695
Yes, I knew the risk I was
taking... And I took it!

50:08.696 --> 50:10.730
Oh my God!

50:10.731 --> 50:14.301
How I hate being tangled up in
other people's emotions!

50:14.302 --> 50:15.836
I've tried to avoid it all my life.

50:15.837 --> 50:17.937
It always happens to me!

50:17.938 --> 50:21.073
Always.

50:21.074 --> 50:22.777
Look, you've always said that
I don't really love you

50:22.778 --> 50:24.910
in the way that you love me.

50:24.911 --> 50:27.681
That's not my fault!

50:27.682 --> 50:29.149
Let me give you a case.

50:29.150 --> 50:33.352
Jack and Jill, Jack loves Jill,
Jill loves Jack.

50:33.353 --> 50:35.821
But Jack doesn't love Jill
in the same way.

50:35.822 --> 50:38.892
- Jack never asked to be loved.
- And what about Jill?

50:38.893 --> 50:42.161
That's Jill's hard luck!

50:42.162 --> 50:45.431
I can't be bloody Romeo all the time!

50:45.432 --> 50:46.732
Come on, you two.

50:46.733 --> 50:49.770
Let's go inside and have a drink.

50:49.771 --> 50:51.370
Have you got a shilling?

50:51.371 --> 50:54.885
- What?
- Have you got a shilling?

51:04.885 --> 51:13.065
For the gas meter.
In case I'm late for supper.

51:17.065 --> 51:21.968
Freddie, darling.

51:21.969 --> 51:24.809
Would you come home with me, please?

51:27.809 --> 51:32.011
No, I will not.

51:32.012 --> 51:35.848
You'll start talking and pleading.

51:35.849 --> 51:40.053
No, I won't.

51:40.054 --> 51:43.489
I promise I won't.

51:43.490 --> 51:48.060
I swear I won't try to make you stay.

51:48.061 --> 51:52.399
I won't even talk if you
don't want me to.

51:52.400 --> 51:57.837
Trust me, Freddie, I swear.

51:57.838 --> 52:00.207
Freddie, be reasonable.

52:00.208 --> 52:03.451
She's given her word, for God's sake!

52:10.451 --> 52:15.055
Will you get my wash things
from the flat for me?

52:15.056 --> 52:18.074
I'll collect the rest of my
stuff when I can face it.

52:34.074 --> 52:36.545
It's all right, Jackie.

52:38.545 --> 52:41.349
He knows me too well.

52:42.349 --> 52:43.920
But you gave your word.

52:45.920 --> 52:49.855
He knew perfectly well I had no
intention of keeping it.

52:49.856 --> 52:51.800
That's why he wouldn't come.

52:59.800 --> 53:04.476
I just wanted to be with
him for a while longer.

53:09.476 --> 53:11.923
At least it's stopped raining.

53:22.923 --> 53:25.991
How long have you been with him?

53:25.992 --> 53:28.861
Since 6.

53:28.862 --> 53:34.600
He can do a lot of talking.
Especially when he's drunk.

53:34.601 --> 53:36.902
At least what he says makes sense.

53:36.903 --> 53:41.408
Does it?

53:41.409 --> 53:45.946
Freddie... was very Frank with me.

53:45.947 --> 53:48.948
So I know the whole situation.

53:48.949 --> 53:51.917
Do you?

53:51.918 --> 53:54.587
We've all been in love.

53:54.588 --> 53:57.591
But there are other aspects
that are just as important.

53:57.592 --> 53:59.859
Maybe more so.

53:59.860 --> 54:01.903
Like spiritual values?

54:08.903 --> 54:13.138
You have exactly the same
expression on your face

54:13.139 --> 54:15.140
as my father had when he...

54:15.141 --> 54:18.611
...talked about the pettiness
of the physical.

54:18.612 --> 54:24.624
Then he suggested I go to lyme
Regis to think things over.

54:29.624 --> 54:31.257
Look, Hester.

54:31.258 --> 54:34.027
I'll get Freddie back to my
place and calm him down.

54:34.028 --> 54:37.297
Give me and Liz a ring once
you've got back home.

54:37.298 --> 54:40.901
Who knows, you may still be
able to work things out.

54:40.902 --> 54:45.071
Thank you, Jackie.

54:45.072 --> 54:47.506
And you'll be fine?

54:47.507 --> 54:50.311
I'll be fine.

55:57.311 --> 55:59.215
It looks like bits of crockery.

56:01.215 --> 56:04.216
It's cubist.

56:04.217 --> 56:06.054
It's like a braque.

56:08.054 --> 56:09.762
Bric-a-braque.

56:14.762 --> 56:19.536
- That was a joke.
- I gathered.

56:22.536 --> 56:25.605
- We can't all be cultured.
- Can't all be childish, either.

56:25.606 --> 56:28.640
Listen, it was childish people
like me that saved people

56:28.641 --> 56:30.243
like you from invasion.

56:30.244 --> 56:31.644
Why do you have to bring that up?!

56:31.645 --> 56:33.712
It's beside the point.

56:33.713 --> 56:36.082
No one is questioning your bravery.

56:36.083 --> 56:37.616
Just your mind.

56:37.617 --> 56:40.453
My mind?

56:40.454 --> 56:42.654
There's nothing wrong with my mind!

56:42.655 --> 56:46.393
- Fubar!
- What do you mean by that?

56:46.394 --> 56:48.329
You're the clever one, you work it out.

56:48.330 --> 56:51.397
What the hell do you mean by that?!

56:51.398 --> 56:53.600
Fubar.
Acronym.

56:53.601 --> 56:57.407
Fucked up beyond all recognition.

56:59.407 --> 57:02.592
- Where are you going?!
- To the impressionists!

57:18.592 --> 57:22.127
Mrs. Page, I thought you
were second delivery.

57:22.128 --> 57:23.428
More misdeliveries?

57:23.563 --> 57:26.265
Wagstaff and Quinn.
Undertakers.

57:26.266 --> 57:28.334
They're at the end of the street.

57:28.335 --> 57:32.605
So are Hawkes and Guyler.
Bleedin' postman.

57:32.606 --> 57:34.707
Lady Collyer, I ask you.

57:34.708 --> 57:37.646
What would she need with a ration book?

57:39.646 --> 57:41.416
That's mine.

57:43.416 --> 57:44.619
I beg your pardon!

57:46.619 --> 57:51.290
It's for me.

57:51.291 --> 57:57.397
- And Mr. Page?
- Is not my husband.

57:57.398 --> 58:01.704
But I would rather you continue
to think of me as Mrs. Page.

58:03.704 --> 58:04.703
All right.

58:04.704 --> 58:08.140
But I run a respectable
house here and I don't

58:08.141 --> 58:12.447
- want any kind of trouble.
- Of course not, Mrs. Elton.

58:13.447 --> 58:17.116
What people do in private
is best left there.

58:17.117 --> 58:20.356
I neither condone nor condemn.

58:23.356 --> 58:25.658
Thank you, Mrs. Elton.

58:25.659 --> 58:28.778
It's very generous of you.

58:45.778 --> 58:47.585
Do you forgive me?

58:51.585 --> 58:54.659
What do you think?

58:59.659 --> 59:02.666
So why did you go to the impressionists?

59:05.666 --> 59:08.456
I only did it for the monet.

01:03:14.581 --> 01:03:16.748
Have Freddie and Jackie got back yet?

01:03:16.749 --> 01:03:17.787
Yes, they're here.

01:03:20.787 --> 01:03:25.056
- May I speak to Freddie?
- I'll just get him for you.

01:03:25.057 --> 01:03:29.594
Darling, it's Hester.
Don't ring off.

01:03:29.595 --> 01:03:35.768
No scene, I promise, I promise.

01:03:35.769 --> 01:03:39.439
I only wanted to know
about the job, that's all.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.207
Did you see the man?

01:03:41.208 --> 01:03:43.509
Yes, he might have something for me.

01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:44.843
Good.

01:03:44.844 --> 01:03:48.748
Well done.

01:03:48.749 --> 01:03:51.750
I've gotta get weaving.

01:03:51.751 --> 01:03:54.719

- Next week.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.089
- As soon as that?
- Yes.

01:03:58.090 --> 01:04:00.993
Oh, Freddie.

01:04:00.994 --> 01:04:05.464
Will you stay with Liz and
Jackie until you leave?

01:04:05.465 --> 01:04:09.669
No, you don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:17.009
Look, Freddie, I want you
to do one last thing for me.

01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:19.678
Will you come and collect
your things yourself?

01:04:19.679 --> 01:04:24.951
Just to say goodbye.
That's all.

01:04:24.952 --> 01:04:26.731

This is a surprise.
No Flitton?

01:08:45.211 --> 01:08:50.218
No, I decided to drive myself.
I thought it best.

01:08:52.218 --> 01:08:56.154
I was worried about you.

01:08:56.156 --> 01:09:02.374
Please.
Get in. Out of the chill.

01:09:14.374 --> 01:09:16.008
Where is he?

01:09:16.009 --> 01:09:19.383
Drinking... with a friend.

01:09:23.383 --> 01:09:25.817
What's happened to you, Hester?

01:09:25.818 --> 01:09:29.291
Love, Bill... that's all.

01:09:32.291 --> 01:09:35.127
And it's driven you to attempt suicide?

01:09:35.127 --> 01:09:37.828
No.

01:09:37.830 --> 01:09:40.932
I drove myself.

01:09:40.933 --> 01:09:45.470
Love, it would seem,
drives all sorts of things.

01:09:45.471 --> 01:09:47.807
What is that quote about love?

01:09:47.808 --> 01:09:51.109
"It comforteth like
sunshine after rain...

01:09:51.111 --> 01:09:54.352
...and lust's effect is
tempest after sun."

01:09:59.352 --> 01:10:01.921
One can't go on living on a flat plane.

01:10:01.922 --> 01:10:05.891
Not after discovering something more...

01:10:05.892 --> 01:10:09.061
Primitive?

01:10:09.062 --> 01:10:13.132
Shall we say natural?

01:10:13.133 --> 01:10:16.302
In sober truth, Hester, isn't it lust?

01:10:16.303 --> 01:10:18.838
Oh, Bill.

01:10:18.839 --> 01:10:23.107
Do you honestly think I can
tell you in sober truth

01:10:23.108 --> 01:10:25.910
what it is I feel for Freddie?

01:10:25.911 --> 01:10:31.984
Lust isn't the whole of life but
Freddie is, you see, for me...

01:10:31.985 --> 01:10:35.521
...the whole of life.

01:10:35.522 --> 01:10:36.522
And death.

01:10:36.556 --> 01:10:38.558
So...

01:10:39.558 --> 01:10:42.607
...put a label on that
if you can.

01:10:54.607 --> 01:10:59.311
His life stopped in 1940.

01:10:59.312 --> 01:11:01.881
He loved 1940.

01:11:01.882 --> 01:11:06.089
He's never been really
happy since the war.

01:11:09.089 --> 01:11:14.927
He once told me he envied you.
A brilliant lawyer.

01:11:14.928 --> 01:11:18.129
That sounds too spontaneous
to be sincere.

01:11:18.130 --> 01:11:21.432
No, he meant it.

01:11:21.433 --> 01:11:25.637
He said he envied you for other
reasons besides your career.

01:11:25.638 --> 01:11:29.173
I knew then... in that tiny moment,

01:11:29.174 --> 01:11:31.243
I had no power to resist him.

01:11:31.244 --> 01:11:35.180
No power at all.

01:11:35.181 --> 01:11:40.252
During those months, why didn't
you talk to me about it?

01:11:40.253 --> 01:11:42.588
It would have made no difference.

01:11:42.589 --> 01:11:45.190
Meaning that I would have
made no difference?

01:11:45.191 --> 01:11:46.561
That's not what I said.

01:11:48.561 --> 01:11:51.129
The noble judge.

01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:56.634
Hung any good christians lately?

01:11:56.635 --> 01:12:00.004
Have you heard about her little accident?

01:12:00.005 --> 01:12:01.673
Did you ever forget her birthday?

01:12:01.674 --> 01:12:04.610
No, you're not the forgetful type.

01:12:04.611 --> 01:12:06.145
Freddie, you're drunk.
Go inside.

01:12:06.146 --> 01:12:07.680
Yes, squadron leader!

01:12:07.681 --> 01:12:09.347
You see how I'm bullied?

01:12:09.348 --> 01:12:11.650
I bet you were never bullied like this.

01:12:11.651 --> 01:12:13.217
Am I being uncouth?

01:12:13.218 --> 01:12:16.288
"Yes, Freddie, you're being very uncouth."

01:12:16.289 --> 01:12:18.256
Why don't you come round
again soon when I've

01:12:18.257 --> 01:12:19.548
got some self-respect back.

01:12:19.558 --> 01:12:21.526
You'll know we're in.

01:12:21.527 --> 01:12:25.263
I'll leave 'mother' burning
in the window for you.

01:12:25.264 --> 01:12:28.040
Still love her, my lord?!

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:37.609
- The answer to that is yes.
- Please, Bill, don't.

01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:40.346
Hester, don't you see what
I'm offering you?

01:12:40.347 --> 01:12:43.615
And don't you see how difficult
it is for me to refuse?

01:12:43.616 --> 01:12:47.485
Is there nothing I can say?

01:12:47.486 --> 01:12:50.321
No.

01:12:50.322 --> 01:12:55.026
But let's, let's see what
the future brings.

01:12:55.027 --> 01:12:57.195
Our future?

01:12:57.196 --> 01:13:00.632
No, just...

01:13:00.633 --> 01:13:04.347
...the future.

01:13:14.347 --> 01:13:19.183
- Belated birthday gift.
- Oh, Bill.

01:13:19.184 --> 01:13:20.669
Thank you.

01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:38.369
"The sonnets."

01:13:38.504 --> 01:13:42.134
Thank you.
I've always loved them.

01:14:41.134 --> 01:14:43.267
Mrs. Page?
Do you have a minute?

01:14:43.268 --> 01:14:44.670
Yes, of course.
What is it?

01:14:44.671 --> 01:14:48.140
On your way up, could you ask...

01:14:48.141 --> 01:14:50.879
All right, I'm coming, Frank.

01:14:53.879 --> 01:14:58.616
There, there.
Safe as houses.

01:14:58.617 --> 01:15:04.558
I can face anything so
long as you're there.

01:15:05.558 --> 01:15:07.695
I'll always be here, Frank.

01:15:08.695 --> 01:15:12.297
You handsome devil.

01:15:12.298 --> 01:15:15.234
You was a real dish, weren't you?

01:15:15.235 --> 01:15:18.602
Yeah, a real dish.

01:15:50.602 --> 01:15:55.775
By the way, I don't want a repeat
of that nonsense this morning.

01:15:55.776 --> 01:15:58.643
Do you hear?

01:15:58.644 --> 01:16:02.713
Sometimes it's difficult to judge...

01:16:02.714 --> 01:16:06.618
...when you're caught between
the devil and the deep blue sea.

01:16:06.619 --> 01:16:10.655
A lot of rubbish is talked about love.

01:16:10.656 --> 01:16:14.959
You know what real love is?
It's wiping someone's arse...

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:19.397
...or changing the sheets when
they've wet themselves.

01:16:19.398 --> 01:16:22.734
And letting them keep their
dignity so you can both go on.

01:16:22.735 --> 01:16:25.803
Suicide?

01:16:25.804 --> 01:16:28.857
No one's worth it.

01:16:45.857 --> 01:16:48.694
Mr. Miller?
Mr. Elton's ready now.

01:16:48.695 --> 01:16:51.504
I'll be down in a minute.

01:16:59.504 --> 01:17:00.710
Freddie, let me in.

01:17:04.710 --> 01:17:08.486
Freddie, don't be childish.
Let me in.

01:17:47.486 --> 01:17:51.490
The South American made me an offer.

01:17:51.491 --> 01:17:52.794
What kind of offer?

01:17:54.794 --> 01:17:58.597
A test pilot.

01:17:58.598 --> 01:18:02.801
But you said a hundred times
that you wouldn't go back to it.

01:18:02.802 --> 01:18:06.771
You told me that you had no
nerve or judgement left.

01:18:06.772 --> 01:18:08.677
I know what I said.

01:18:10.677 --> 01:18:15.614
But I'm accepting it anyway.

01:18:15.615 --> 01:18:21.419
Don't worry about my nerve or judgement.

01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:25.661
A month or two on the wagon
and I'll be the old ace again.

01:18:29.661 --> 01:18:32.396
Whereabouts in South America?

01:18:32.397 --> 01:18:34.637
- Rio.
- Rio?

01:18:37.637 --> 01:18:40.443
When do we go?

01:18:44.443 --> 01:18:45.443
We don't.

01:18:50.549 --> 01:18:54.652
I'm going alone.

01:18:54.653 --> 01:18:56.527
That's what I wanted to tell you.

01:19:02.527 --> 01:19:04.135
Why, Freddie?

01:19:10.135 --> 01:19:12.704
Today.

01:19:12.705 --> 01:19:17.441
The letter.

01:19:17.442 --> 01:19:21.680
The suicide attempt.

01:19:21.681 --> 01:19:24.786
We're lethal to each other.

01:19:27.786 --> 01:19:31.655
You can't expect a bloke
to go on after he's

01:19:31.656 --> 01:19:35.025
driven someone to suicide...

01:19:35.026 --> 01:19:38.029
...much as he loves her.

01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:43.901
Do you think that leaving me
will drive me away from it?

01:19:43.902 --> 01:19:48.774
That's a risk we'll both have to take.

01:19:48.775 --> 01:19:53.811
You're scaring me, Freddie.

01:19:53.812 --> 01:19:56.748
It's on the level.

01:19:56.749 --> 01:20:02.486
I don't enjoy hurting you.
I'm not a sadist...

01:20:02.487 --> 01:20:03.629
...but it's on the level.

01:20:09.629 --> 01:20:13.731
- I'll leave now.
- Freddie, stay with me tonight.

01:20:13.732 --> 01:20:14.740
Just one more night.

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:24.642
No.

01:20:24.643 --> 01:20:31.048
You'll start talking...
And I... I'll be lost.

01:20:31.049 --> 01:20:33.051
Both of us will be lost.

01:20:33.052 --> 01:20:36.221
Don't be cruel.
How can you be so cruel?

01:20:36.222 --> 01:20:40.859
- It's over, Hes.
- No, it isn't, that isn't true.

01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:44.228
It's over.

01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:47.766
It ended today.

01:20:47.767 --> 01:20:50.714
I'm sorry, Hes.

01:21:01.714 --> 01:21:04.048
Don't look at me like that.

01:21:04.049 --> 01:21:06.500
You've no idea what it does to me.

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.709
All your things are here.

01:21:29.709 --> 01:21:32.121
You're going to have to pack.

01:21:43.121 --> 01:21:44.759
I won't speak.

01:21:47.759 --> 01:21:50.967
I won't argue.

01:21:54.967 --> 01:21:58.005
But please don't leave me alone tonight.

01:22:00.005 --> 01:22:01.775
Not tonight.

01:22:02.775 --> 01:22:07.308
Please don't leave me alone tonight.

01:23:09.308 --> 01:23:10.818
You look smart.

01:23:19.818 --> 01:23:23.387
The old blue serge.

01:23:23.388 --> 01:23:26.057
Will it pass?

01:23:26.058 --> 01:23:29.860
It'll pass.

01:23:29.861 --> 01:23:31.733
But those shoes need a clean.

01:23:34.733 --> 01:23:37.142
Yes.

01:23:44.142 --> 01:23:47.212
Don't put the shoes on the table.

01:23:47.213 --> 01:23:49.948
It's bad luck.

01:23:49.949 --> 01:23:52.784
That's what they say.

01:23:52.785 --> 01:23:54.804
Do they?

01:24:12.804 --> 01:24:17.808
Did you have any breakfast?

01:24:17.809 --> 01:24:20.779
Just a black coffee.

01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:22.826
No hair of the dog.

01:25:41.826 --> 01:25:44.863
When exactly are you off to Rio?

01:25:44.864 --> 01:25:50.901
Thursday.
I told you.

01:25:50.902 --> 01:25:52.904
Yes.

01:25:52.905 --> 01:25:57.374
Course you did.
By boat?

01:25:57.375 --> 01:26:02.046
No.
I'm flying.

01:26:02.047 --> 01:26:03.882
London.

01:26:03.883 --> 01:26:06.517
West Africa.
And then...

01:26:06.518 --> 01:26:11.356
...across to natal.

01:26:11.357 --> 01:26:13.181
Sounds exciting.

01:26:35.181 --> 01:26:39.817
By the way, about the rent.

01:26:39.818 --> 01:26:47.258
My golf clubs will probably fetch...

01:26:47.259 --> 01:26:51.228
...30 or 40 quid.
So...

01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:53.977
...that will take care of the
rent and some more bills.

01:27:04.977 --> 01:27:06.616
And what will you do, Hes?

01:27:10.616 --> 01:27:12.987
I'm not quite sure.

01:27:15.987 --> 01:27:18.558
Get the divorce out of the way.

01:27:19.558 --> 01:27:22.429
Tidy things up.

01:27:24.429 --> 01:27:26.367
Good idea.

01:27:29.367 --> 01:27:32.536
It's never too late to begin again?

01:27:32.537 --> 01:27:34.472
Isn't that what they say?

01:27:34.473 --> 01:27:35.539
Yes...

01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:39.183
...that's what they say.

01:28:51.183 --> 01:28:53.208
Goodbye, Hes.

01:29:16.208 --> 01:29:18.014
Goodbye, Freddie.

01:29:23.014 --> 01:29:24.719
I'm gonna miss you.

01:29:27.719 --> 01:29:31.588
Thanks...

01:29:31.589 --> 01:29:33.500
...for everything.

01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:42.672
Thank you.

01:29:46.672 --> 01:29:47.611
Be safe.

01:29:53.611 --> 01:29:54.547
Be good.
