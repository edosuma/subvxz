WEBVTT

00:00.398 --> 00:01.593
Last season on GREEK...

00:01.615 --> 00:04.054
I will now open up the floor
for presidential nominations.

00:04.174 --> 00:05.451
I nominate Trip ***.

00:05.571 --> 00:07.125
I would like to nominate
Calvin Owens.

00:07.245 --> 00:09.480
- Me?
- We wanted to give them the beach house.

00:09.521 --> 00:12.745
Which we will use as the greatest
revenge KT has ever known.

00:12.753 --> 00:14.304
I'm shutting this party down.

00:14.305 --> 00:16.033
It's your place.
I need to see your IDs.

00:16.033 --> 00:18.246
Cap, come on, man. We could
lose our house, for real.

00:18.247 --> 00:20.957
Well, that's not what we intended,
but it seems fitting.

00:20.958 --> 00:23.161
- Hope he doesn't screw this up.
- Can't get much worse.

00:23.162 --> 00:25.502
- All right, guys, we're good here.
- What the hell did you do?

00:25.503 --> 00:27.314
- I handled it.
- You got my vote, Owens.

00:27.315 --> 00:29.797
- Phase four is complete.
- May I congratulate

00:29.798 --> 00:32.348
the future president of Omega Chi.

00:32.348 --> 00:35.032
- I'm Faith Flowers.
- Faith Flowers is a trend forecaster.

00:35.033 --> 00:36.819
Companies pay her to tell them
what the latest trends are.

00:36.820 --> 00:38.797
I'm graduating from
CRU in about a month,

00:38.798 --> 00:40.396
and I would love
to do what you do.

00:40.397 --> 00:44.258
Or learn from you, or, um,
get you coffee. What do you say?

00:44.259 --> 00:47.287
I got a job.
I'm going to New York!

00:47.288 --> 00:49.620
I'm not the good guy.
I let my pride get in the way.

00:49.621 --> 00:50.887
I don't wanna lose you.

00:52.109 --> 00:54.986
I can accept you
just the way you are.

00:54.991 --> 00:57.073
What about graduation in May?

00:57.074 --> 00:58.410
We'll worry about that in May.

01:01.168 --> 01:03.472
- I can't.
- You've got a boyfriend.

01:03.473 --> 01:06.837
- Haven't you?
- I got into law school in Washington.

01:06.838 --> 01:08.733
- That's great.
- Are you leaving me behind?

01:08.734 --> 01:10.633
- No... - If you don't have more
faith in us than that,

01:10.656 --> 01:11.916
then we should break up right now.

01:12.008 --> 01:13.898
Cappie, please, Cappie...

01:14.615 --> 01:15.554
Please!

01:16.946 --> 01:18.540
Graduating from college

01:18.541 --> 01:20.746
is certainly an accomplishment
you should savor.

01:20.979 --> 01:23.750
Don't lose the significance
of this day as you begin

01:23.751 --> 01:26.143
to turn your focus
toward that next horizon.

01:26.733 --> 01:27.737
Even now...

01:29.485 --> 01:32.292
My new boss is so cool.
Oh, my God, I have a real boss.

01:32.636 --> 01:35.344
And she texts me, with x's and o's.

01:35.917 --> 01:37.892
I can't believe we're graduating.

01:38.408 --> 01:40.318
- It's like a dream.
- We're so grown-up!

01:40.319 --> 01:41.301
Jinx! You owe me a Coke!

01:41.302 --> 01:42.266
Sh!

01:45.458 --> 01:46.285
Hey.

01:46.830 --> 01:49.350
...high school, and now college.

01:52.410 --> 01:54.566
Some of you will be
starting entry-level jobs,

01:54.567 --> 01:57.383
which could blossom
into lifelong careers.

01:57.384 --> 02:00.591
I can't find Casey. They all look
the same in those stupid hats.

02:00.592 --> 02:03.502
There's Evan. And Grant.

02:03.503 --> 02:05.860
And flirty straight
guy from last year!

02:05.861 --> 02:07.168
I didn't know he was a senior.

02:07.169 --> 02:11.153
- Uh, flirty straight guy?
- Oh... I meant ugly stupid guy.

02:13.297 --> 02:15.022
There's Casey. I could spot those

02:15.023 --> 02:16.792
blonde locks in the middle
of a Swedish flea market.

02:16.793 --> 02:19.610
- Whoo!
- Guys, do you mind?

02:19.611 --> 02:21.449
Love you, Casey! Love you!

02:22.062 --> 02:23.858
I'm trying to watch
my boyfriend graduate.

02:23.952 --> 02:26.706
You've learned a lot in your
time here at Cyprus-Rhodes,

02:26.994 --> 02:29.319
one would hope. Just a reminder,

02:30.562 --> 02:32.478
there are no refunds.

02:37.465 --> 02:39.663
I thought it was funny.
But there's one more thing

02:39.664 --> 02:40.951
I'd like to leave you with today.

02:41.335 --> 02:44.059
A wise person once said
that the grand essentials

02:44.060 --> 02:46.441
of happiness are
these three things:

02:46.784 --> 02:47.583
Something to do,

02:48.499 --> 02:49.814
something to love

02:51.587 --> 02:53.035
and something to hope for.

02:56.131 --> 02:57.265
Don't forget us here.

03:00.220 --> 03:01.987
College may be over for you,

03:01.988 --> 03:04.851
but your education
is just beginning.

03:05.571 --> 03:07.633
Now, go on out there
and make us proud.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.268
Thank you.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:29.654 --> 03:31.788
Congratulations, Case.

03:33.615 --> 03:36.921
- Mom and Dad went back to the hotel.
- We graduated! Ooh!

03:36.922 --> 03:37.899
Yeah!

03:38.959 --> 03:41.841
And next week,
I will be living in Manhattan.

03:41.842 --> 03:43.796
The Big Apple.
The city that never sleeps.

03:43.797 --> 03:46.285
- The home of Carrie Bradshaw.
- I don't want you to leave.

03:46.286 --> 03:48.280
Can't you just move out to DC now

03:48.281 --> 03:50.998
and forget about your stupid
law school prep thing?

03:50.999 --> 03:54.116
I mean, we could take trains
to visit each other. Trains!

03:54.117 --> 03:56.122
- That's very cosmopolitan.
- But

03:56.125 --> 03:59.052
GW doesn't offer the prep
school thing, and CRU does.

03:59.053 --> 04:01.387
I am a serious law student now,

04:01.388 --> 04:04.215
ergo, I have to do serious
law student-y things.

04:04.216 --> 04:06.560
- Like say "Ergo."
- Hey,

04:06.561 --> 04:10.053
Ashleigh, I got you a
going-away present.

04:17.334 --> 04:20.878
Oh. It's a, uh, rape whistle.

04:21.116 --> 04:23.657
Oh... No, it's for hailing taxis.

04:23.936 --> 04:26.285
- Just a little something.
- Oh!

04:28.008 --> 04:29.051
Yep.

04:29.291 --> 04:33.399
Well, I love my new
not-rape taxi whistle.

04:33.787 --> 04:34.535
Thank you.

04:36.884 --> 04:39.410
OK. So I'm gonna go find the fam.

04:39.411 --> 04:41.701
- And I will see you at the party later.
- OK.

04:41.702 --> 04:42.580
- OK, bye!
- Bye.

04:42.581 --> 04:44.676
- Bye.
- So...

04:45.281 --> 04:48.274
Pretty soon you'll be the
lone Cartwright on campus.

04:48.275 --> 04:50.964
- Is this you passing the proverbial torch?
- It is.

04:51.569 --> 04:52.411
Don't drop it.

04:59.709 --> 05:00.314
What?

05:01.765 --> 05:05.122
Well, I hoped that
because I'm graduating,

05:05.478 --> 05:08.255
Cappie would say good luck

05:08.256 --> 05:11.926
or congratulations
or even just goodbye.

05:14.436 --> 05:15.247
Maybe he will.

05:19.242 --> 05:20.687
Oh, God! I didn't mean right now!

05:20.688 --> 05:22.101
Do I have to stay and referee?

05:22.310 --> 05:23.799
I don't want a repeat
of Cinco de Mayo.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.136
- That was the tequila's fault.
- Uh-huh.

05:26.483 --> 05:28.974
This could be it.
Our final farewell.

05:29.775 --> 05:32.877
What's he going to say?
What do I say back?

05:32.878 --> 05:34.220
And how am I supposed to

05:34.221 --> 05:36.276
look cute in this
stupid graduation burqa?

05:51.542 --> 05:52.467
Nice hat.

05:58.316 --> 05:59.927
Nice hat?

06:00.127 --> 06:10.327
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

06:17.565 --> 06:20.110
- Good morning.
- Wow, you have a date?

06:20.380 --> 06:24.581
- In the eighties?
- No, but I plan to get one.

06:24.582 --> 06:26.373
I'm starting back
as ZBZ hasher today.

06:26.374 --> 06:29.146
- So is Laura back on the menu?
- Laura who?

06:29.147 --> 06:31.330
We are on the precipice
of our junior year,

06:31.331 --> 06:33.111
and next to providing
an education,

06:33.112 --> 06:36.375
the second biggest thing college
does is play matchmaker.

06:36.829 --> 06:39.950
I got two years left to find the
future Mrs. Dale Kettlewell.

06:40.432 --> 06:44.204
- In the ZBZ house?
- They're not all Jezebels.

06:46.025 --> 06:49.062
- Is that gladiator porn?
- No, it's not porn.

06:49.139 --> 06:51.817
I'm doing research to kick
off the KT-Omega Chi truce.

06:52.184 --> 06:54.679
- We're having a four-pack.
- All I see are six-packs.

06:55.169 --> 06:58.067
Already abusing your presidential
power for personal gain.

06:58.068 --> 06:59.540
- It's porn if there's nipples.
- Yup.

06:59.541 --> 07:01.767
The gladiators are wearing togas,

07:01.768 --> 07:03.963
which, in ancient Rome, were
considered a symbol of peace.

07:06.149 --> 07:07.403
It's thematic.

07:08.925 --> 07:11.225
Cappie will be onboard.
Is he back yet?

07:11.226 --> 07:12.647
I don't know. He took this road

07:12.659 --> 07:14.942
trip in May and nobody's
heard from him all summer.

07:14.943 --> 07:16.463
He didn't even say
goodbye to Casey.

07:16.903 --> 07:20.331
- Is he going to?
- I'm gonna stay out of it.

07:20.636 --> 07:23.464
But I'm sure Cappie
will do something.

07:23.744 --> 07:24.931
You know him, he's probably

07:24.932 --> 07:26.887
just gonna wait until
the last second.

07:27.154 --> 07:29.578
He loves the drama, and romance.

07:30.339 --> 07:32.313
And procrastinating.

08:28.983 --> 08:31.734
Hey, I'm on another coffee run.
I only have two minutes to talk.

08:31.735 --> 08:34.448
- Go! - I found your Yoga for Dummies
DVD behind the desk.

08:34.448 --> 08:36.337
- Do you want me to mail it to you?
- No, I'm doing yoga

08:36.337 --> 08:38.229
for normal people now.
How's packing?

08:38.230 --> 08:40.236
Well, I'm slowly
checking things off

08:40.238 --> 08:42.825
my last-things-to-do-
before-I-leave list.

08:42.826 --> 08:45.927
Um, I found a pair of earrings
I borrowed from Frannie.

08:45.928 --> 08:48.934
- Ew, gross.
- Which are going to Goodwill.

08:49.659 --> 08:52.263
The law book I used
for my summer course,

08:52.264 --> 08:53.096
which I'm going to sell.

08:53.191 --> 08:56.453
And Cappie's
"Jamaica Me Horny" T-shirt,

08:56.813 --> 08:59.843
- which I'm going to burn.
- Stop thinking about Cappie,

08:59.844 --> 09:01.637
get in your car and get out here.

09:01.638 --> 09:03.485
I am done thinking about Cappie.

09:03.486 --> 09:06.078
I spent all summer
thinking about "Nice hat."

09:06.398 --> 09:08.312
I just want to set
his shirt on fire.

09:08.313 --> 09:10.862
- So how's the real world?
- Oh...

09:11.095 --> 09:13.585
Well, I make no money.
I share a tiny apartment

09:13.586 --> 09:15.606
with four roommates and
no air conditioning.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.837
And everyone here's
always in such a hurry.

09:18.087 --> 09:19.897
This city has major
time-management issues.

09:20.248 --> 09:21.807
- Watch it!
- Sorry!

09:21.808 --> 09:24.476
And anger-management issues.

09:26.158 --> 09:29.304
And Faith keeps texting me
with those stupid x's and o's,

09:29.305 --> 09:30.960
which are nothing but lies!

09:32.227 --> 09:34.881
Oh. Well, I'm sure
it's not that bad.

09:34.882 --> 09:36.452
Tell Rusty I'm totally using

09:36.453 --> 09:38.618
my not-rape taxi whistle.
Talk to you later. Bye.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.825
Miss you, and love you. Bye, Ash.

09:42.903 --> 09:43.697
No!

09:45.568 --> 09:47.210
And what exactly is your policy

09:47.211 --> 09:48.362
on boys staying over?

09:48.654 --> 09:51.169
It's against ZBZ
Nationals' policy.

09:51.170 --> 09:52.762
Uh-huh. But what's your policy?

09:53.871 --> 09:56.827
My policy is ZBZ
Nationals' policy.

09:56.828 --> 09:57.947
Uh-huh.

09:59.938 --> 10:03.044
Well, thank you for coming in.
Kelly will show you out.

10:03.045 --> 10:04.351
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.313
That was the last candidate
from Nationals for house mom.

10:10.314 --> 10:12.528
She does have over 20
years of experience.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.818
So does Kirsten Dunst, but that
doesn't make her movies good.

10:14.819 --> 10:17.615
I think we should hire
that drunk one, Joan.

10:18.283 --> 10:21.127
As president, I say we
find other candidates,

10:21.128 --> 10:23.712
preferably senile ones with a
hearing or sight impairment.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.224
- But where can we find them?
- You know, I can help.

10:26.225 --> 10:27.465
My church is full of those.

10:27.466 --> 10:29.355
The last thing we need
is a preacher's wife

10:29.356 --> 10:31.914
throwing verses at us about the
evils of dancing and evolution.

10:31.915 --> 10:33.404
No, but most of them
aren't even that religious.

10:33.405 --> 10:35.815
They just need something
to do on Sunday mornings.

10:35.816 --> 10:38.560
I know one that'd be perfect for us.
Barely knows her own name.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.871
She sounds perfect! Thanks, Dale.

10:42.296 --> 10:46.184
- I like your tie.
- Why, thank you for noticing, Abigail.

10:46.775 --> 10:48.978
Oh, I can't not watch this.

10:48.979 --> 10:52.684
Yes, thank you both. As president,
I think we should meet her.

10:59.637 --> 11:00.787
- Hey!
- Hey.

11:00.788 --> 11:01.613
What are you doing here?

11:01.614 --> 11:03.160
Classes don't start for a
couple of weeks, right?

11:03.238 --> 11:04.847
Yeah, I had to go fill out this

11:04.848 --> 11:07.341
proof of enrollment
thing for financial aid.

11:07.535 --> 11:10.861
- What about you? - Oh, selling my book
from my summer course,

11:11.081 --> 11:14.173
getting through my list of
last-things-to-do before I leave.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.628
Mm. Yeah, you must be
excited to go to DC, huh?

11:16.629 --> 11:18.945
You get to start over in a whole
new place, all new people.

11:19.349 --> 11:22.118
Well, I'm not too thrilled
about starting over.

11:22.119 --> 11:24.844
This has been my home
for the last four years.

11:25.082 --> 11:26.218
Leaving's hard.

11:27.421 --> 11:30.474
But I didn't have much of a choice.
I didn't get into CRU.

11:30.678 --> 11:32.107
Yeah, which is weird, right?

11:32.110 --> 11:33.654
I mean, your LSAT score
was higher than mine.

11:33.856 --> 11:38.204
- So was my GPA.
- So why do you think you didn't you get in?

11:38.486 --> 11:39.529
I don't know.

11:40.239 --> 11:42.856
Maybe they didn't like
my personal statement?

11:43.335 --> 11:45.427
- Who knows?
- If it were me, I'd want to know.

11:54.354 --> 11:58.911
So after a couple days in Charlotte,
there was a week in Helena,

11:59.329 --> 12:01.227
then a few nights in Savannah,

12:01.228 --> 12:03.904
and a whole month
exploring Sydney.

12:04.338 --> 12:06.832
Wow, Cap. You went to Australia?

12:06.833 --> 12:09.944
No, no. Sydney lives in Florida.

12:12.981 --> 12:15.764
Spitter, hey! I didn't see you
standing there! Come here.

12:16.083 --> 12:17.370
- I missed you.
- Oh, man!

12:19.553 --> 12:22.420
All right, all right!
I missed you the most,

12:22.421 --> 12:25.674
my little... Oh, sorry....
equal of mine in the fraternity.

12:25.836 --> 12:27.997
- Yeah. When'd you get back?
- Just a couple hours ago.

12:27.998 --> 12:30.496
It was incredible.
I toured the whole country.

12:30.848 --> 12:32.010
But you were kidding about

12:32.011 --> 12:34.764
all the girls with the
city names, right?

12:34.765 --> 12:38.801
Yeah, their names were Bridget,
Amy, Kelly and T-something.

12:39.174 --> 12:41.168
Oh. What about Casey?

12:42.777 --> 12:44.373
What do you mean,
what about Casey?

12:44.394 --> 12:46.852
She said we had a
college relationship,

12:46.853 --> 12:49.347
and then she graduated.
Then there was Cinco de Mayo.

12:49.348 --> 12:52.385
That was the tequila's fault.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.718
Two days. Casey's
gone in two days.

12:54.719 --> 12:57.992
- So?
- So if you want to say goodbye, or whatever,

12:58.940 --> 13:00.091
you still can.

13:05.379 --> 13:08.083
She's the one leaving, you know.
She could say goodbye to me.

13:09.994 --> 13:10.879
So that's it?

13:11.553 --> 13:14.772
Look, out of respect for
a fellow KT brother,

13:14.773 --> 13:16.177
if you want to give me
your class schedule,

13:16.178 --> 13:17.682
I'll make sure to
tell the ins and outs

13:17.683 --> 13:19.113
of my city stories
when you're gone.

13:20.161 --> 13:23.004
- You know what they say, bros before...
- OK, Cap.

13:39.081 --> 13:41.458
Looks like your personal
statement was fine.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.872
So if that's all you
wanted to know...

13:43.873 --> 13:45.718
Well, since I'm here,
I was just wondering

13:45.719 --> 13:48.726
- if could you tell me why I wasn't accepted?
- No.

13:48.984 --> 13:51.328
But I'm more than
happy to give you tips

13:51.329 --> 13:53.031
on how to improve your
chances for next year.

13:53.032 --> 13:54.855
Oh, I won't be applying again.

13:54.856 --> 13:56.858
I got into GW and I'm leaving, um,

13:57.363 --> 14:01.591
in 39 hours. I was just curious.

14:02.814 --> 14:04.389
OK, fine.

14:04.691 --> 14:05.436
Let's see...

14:06.135 --> 14:09.384
Your LSAT scores were solid,

14:09.385 --> 14:11.145
your grades were good. Oh.

14:11.295 --> 14:14.265
- Oh? - You had a couple of really
good recommendation letters.

14:14.266 --> 14:16.521
A couple? I had three letters.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.240
And a couple of really good ones.

14:19.314 --> 14:22.577
Uh, someone wrote me a bad one?
What'd they say?

14:22.578 --> 14:24.133
- Who was it? Why?
- That's all I can tell you.

14:24.134 --> 14:26.109
Best of luck in Washington,
Miss Cartwright.

14:32.809 --> 14:34.468
Oh. Hey, Becks.

14:34.469 --> 14:36.519
Um, maybe you can help
me with something.

14:36.993 --> 14:38.070
I don't move furniture.

14:38.295 --> 14:41.110
But I could get Evan to make
some of the Omega Chis do it.

14:41.111 --> 14:42.508
No, it's just...

14:44.393 --> 14:47.275
- What are you doing?
- Replacing these fugly curtains.

14:47.743 --> 14:49.637
- I picked those out.
- Mm-hm.

14:51.194 --> 14:55.215
Anyway, I just found out that
I was rejected from CRU Law

14:55.216 --> 14:57.415
because of a bad
recommendation letter.

14:58.163 --> 15:00.076
Not everyone loves
Casey Cartwright?

15:01.215 --> 15:03.849
- Shocker.
- Apparently not.

15:04.369 --> 15:06.073
I just spoke with two
of my professors,

15:06.074 --> 15:07.870
and they both wrote
me glowing letters.

15:07.871 --> 15:10.429
So the only one left is Joel.

15:10.430 --> 15:12.835
- Do you think he'd do that to me?
- Why do you care?

15:12.836 --> 15:14.884
- You got into GW.
- I don't care. I just...

15:15.884 --> 15:18.977
- I mean, I do, but...
- I get it.

15:18.978 --> 15:20.479
Because if he hadn't done that,

15:20.480 --> 15:22.654
you would've stayed at CRU and
you'd still be with Cappie.

15:23.266 --> 15:24.635
- No.
- Yes.

15:25.962 --> 15:27.532
It's just unjust.

15:27.533 --> 15:29.190
I worked my butt off for Joel,

15:29.191 --> 15:30.286
and I did a damn good job.

15:31.103 --> 15:34.051
The only weirdness
he and I ever had was

15:34.281 --> 15:36.160
the night of the Mardi Gras party.

15:36.161 --> 15:38.966
He came on to me,
and then it got all awkward

15:38.967 --> 15:40.085
when I told him I had a boyfriend.

15:40.086 --> 15:42.328
But he couldn't have written
me a bad recommendation

15:42.329 --> 15:43.530
because of that, would he?

15:44.617 --> 15:47.071
- Would he?
- Oh.

15:48.251 --> 15:49.060
That wasn't rhetorical?

15:49.822 --> 15:51.638
Casey, you're moving
to Washington.

15:51.639 --> 15:53.150
Let it go, and go!

16:00.971 --> 16:02.485
They're circling me like sharks.

16:02.486 --> 16:05.172
Well, it's the new Greek waters.
They'll get used to it.

16:05.421 --> 16:06.944
And now I'm president, and I say

16:07.260 --> 16:08.829
you can come by and hang
out whenever you want.

16:08.830 --> 16:10.747
Great idea, Cal. In fact,

16:10.748 --> 16:12.711
why don't we just combine houses?
That'd be rad!

16:13.743 --> 16:15.836
I just want us to
stop fighting, Trip.

16:15.837 --> 16:17.922
Do you have any idea why
you don't like the KTs?

16:18.203 --> 16:20.758
Yeah. They're KTs.

16:24.834 --> 16:29.057
- I really don't like that guy.
- Not everyone's onboard yet,

16:29.058 --> 16:32.034
but after the toga party,
that will change.

16:32.148 --> 16:34.237
Even Cappie thinks the
party will promote peace.

16:34.238 --> 16:36.498
And promiscuity.
Speaking of which,

16:36.499 --> 16:37.850
did you hear about
Cappie's road trip?

16:38.230 --> 16:39.633
He sure did hit a
lot of cities, huh?

16:39.634 --> 16:42.610
Yeah, I know. It's obvious
he's still mad at Casey.

16:42.611 --> 16:44.206
He's kind of being
a jerk about it.

16:44.207 --> 16:46.405
What do you expect him?
He hasn't changed.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.642
That's the problem. I just
wish he'd grow up a little.

16:48.790 --> 16:49.768
It's Cappie.

16:50.387 --> 16:52.444
You said it yourself,
he's like Peter Pan.

16:52.979 --> 16:54.960
He'll probably be KT
president for life.

17:01.574 --> 17:03.635
Ladies, this is Miriam.

17:03.636 --> 17:05.234
She's still spry at 73,

17:05.236 --> 17:06.731
but has a slight hearing problem,

17:06.732 --> 17:09.247
so please speak
loudly and enunciate.

17:09.743 --> 17:12.002
Hello, Miriam!

17:12.002 --> 17:16.707
- Welcome to ZBZ!
- Ooh! I'd love some tea.

17:17.026 --> 17:21.864
- So far she sounds perfect.
- Shut your hole, Abby.

17:21.865 --> 17:25.895
I always wanted to be in a sorority,
and now here's my chance.

17:26.281 --> 17:30.373
Will there be a house father?
And will we share a room?

17:30.374 --> 17:31.687
I think you probably just

17:31.688 --> 17:33.528
want to know if there's
a man around the house

17:33.529 --> 17:35.523
for all the physical labor, right?

17:35.930 --> 17:39.016
I guess you could call it that.

17:40.911 --> 17:44.898
Dale, as president, I will be
the one asking the questions.

17:44.899 --> 17:48.083
- Yeah, of course.
- Don't you have work to do?

17:48.902 --> 17:51.684
Right, yeah. You keep quiz Miriam

17:53.152 --> 17:54.426
and I'll go hit the P&P.

17:54.973 --> 17:57.094
That's pots and pans.
Hasher lingo.

18:04.680 --> 18:07.516
Hi. Uh, there's been a mistake,

18:07.517 --> 18:09.728
because this check is half
what it's supposed to be.

18:09.729 --> 18:12.315
- It's the correct amount.
- OK, well, can you check?

18:12.754 --> 18:16.050
- Please? It's Evan Chambers.
- Evan Chambers?

18:16.051 --> 18:19.704
As in Chambers Hall? As in the
name on the building across campus

18:19.705 --> 18:22.589
'cause your family donated
millions of dollars to the school?

18:22.865 --> 18:24.295
- That Evan Chambers?
- That's me.

18:24.779 --> 18:27.357
But that is my parents' money.
I don't...

18:27.358 --> 18:29.955
You know, we have students
who actually need the aid.

18:31.919 --> 18:36.885
OK, look, I haven't received any support,
financial or otherwise,

18:36.886 --> 18:38.667
from my parents in almost a year,

18:38.668 --> 18:41.727
and I have to put a deposit
on an apartment today.

18:41.843 --> 18:43.262
So I am one of those

18:43.263 --> 18:45.544
students that you mentioned
who needs the aid...

18:47.111 --> 18:48.558
...no matter what the
building's named.

18:49.339 --> 18:50.443
There's nothing I can do.

18:51.107 --> 18:52.581
Wait, maybe there is. Um...

18:53.949 --> 18:55.140
It's not the Four Seasons.

18:59.357 --> 19:00.780
Law school dorms?

19:06.847 --> 19:09.448
Actually facing this way.
That's my shape.

19:09.449 --> 19:10.632
- I did it.
- Well...

19:10.633 --> 19:12.646
- What's up, guys?
- Hey, Spitter, check it out.

19:12.647 --> 19:14.563
I replaced the seat
of the KT throne

19:14.564 --> 19:17.059
with a foam cushion specially
contoured to my butt.

19:17.414 --> 19:18.706
- That is great.
- Right?

19:18.707 --> 19:20.214
If you want to be president

19:20.225 --> 19:21.716
of Kappa Tau forever.

19:22.313 --> 19:24.540
What if someone else wants
to run for president?

19:24.541 --> 19:27.008
- Of what?
- Of Kappa Tau.

19:27.849 --> 19:30.000
- Like who?
- Like me.

19:33.110 --> 19:34.030
You...

19:36.569 --> 19:38.099
- Really?
- Yeah. We forgot to hold

19:38.100 --> 19:41.005
elections at the end
of last year. Again.

19:42.016 --> 19:44.489
And I'd like to run for president.

19:44.490 --> 19:46.180
But Spitter,
you're Cappie's little bro.

19:46.181 --> 19:49.157
- You take over when he dies.
- Yeah, it's in the by-laws.

19:49.158 --> 19:52.548
Huh. Looks like we have
another ambitious Cartwright.

19:53.004 --> 19:54.372
What's a little
friendly competition?

19:57.126 --> 20:00.819
All right. I accept your
friendly competition.

20:00.820 --> 20:02.204
Tonight, before the toga party,

20:02.363 --> 20:04.926
we'll determine the
next KT president

20:04.927 --> 20:07.295
with a duel to the death!

20:07.941 --> 20:10.734
- Wait. A what?
- I'm just kidding.

20:10.735 --> 20:12.755
Speeches. Try and keep
it under two minutes.

20:25.417 --> 20:27.268
Casey Cartwright.
What can I do for you?

20:27.382 --> 20:29.283
Well, I don't know if
you heard the news.

20:29.574 --> 20:31.266
It's not like it was
on CNN or anything.

20:33.819 --> 20:37.045
Um, but I was
accepted into GW law.

20:37.579 --> 20:39.604
- I'm leaving tomorrow.
- Congrats, Casey.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.487
- They're lucky to have you.
- But I was rejected from CRU.

20:43.488 --> 20:47.375
And I'm just curious, um,
the letter of recommendation you wrote,

20:47.376 --> 20:49.044
did you recommend me?

20:49.045 --> 20:50.867
Because I thought that
was kind of the point.

20:51.347 --> 20:54.200
Look, you got into GW. Be happy.

20:54.201 --> 20:57.091
I just need to know. Why would
you write me a bad letter?

20:57.092 --> 20:59.095
Was it because of my work?
Did I do something wrong?

21:00.015 --> 21:02.692
Is it because I didn't
tell you I had a boyfriend?

21:02.693 --> 21:05.118
Honestly? Your performance
here was good.

21:05.614 --> 21:09.420
But at the end of the day,
I thought you lacked integrity.

21:10.758 --> 21:12.275
Lacked integrity?

21:12.598 --> 21:15.780
You intentionally misled me
by withholding information,

21:15.781 --> 21:17.506
which makes me question your

21:17.507 --> 21:20.022
character and what kind
of lawyer you'd make.

21:20.023 --> 21:21.776
But obviously, you didn't

21:21.777 --> 21:23.909
need my help getting into
law school elsewhere.

21:24.223 --> 21:26.935
You're a smart, pretty girl.

21:27.817 --> 21:29.166
Good luck in Washington.

21:35.443 --> 21:36.641
And then he was like,

21:36.642 --> 21:38.924
"Good luck in Washington,
you're a pretty girl."

21:39.039 --> 21:41.291
And yes, it's great that
he thinks I'm pretty,

21:41.447 --> 21:42.555
but I couldn't believe that!

21:42.556 --> 21:45.304
Joel is so not cute anymore!
All I see is ugly.

21:46.565 --> 21:49.581
Joel. J-O-E-L.

21:51.377 --> 21:53.566
Thank you so much.

21:53.567 --> 21:55.448
Um, Ashleigh has my number.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.006
This is her friend Casey.

21:57.806 --> 21:59.552
Actually, could you...? Hello?

22:00.666 --> 22:03.190
- Hello?
- Hey, Case.

22:04.083 --> 22:05.762
Do you happen to have all your old

22:05.763 --> 22:08.480
campaign stuff from when you
were running for ZBZ president?

22:08.481 --> 22:09.605
It's all packed up. Why?

22:09.920 --> 22:12.682
Because I'm running against
Cappie for KT president.

22:13.785 --> 22:15.993
- Really?
- You sound like Cappie.

22:15.994 --> 22:17.990
And Dale. And Calvin.

22:17.991 --> 22:20.641
And Mom. Look, I think I can win.

22:20.642 --> 22:21.712
It's just that I don't have

22:21.713 --> 22:24.299
the time to make the
buttons and the T-shirts.

22:24.300 --> 22:25.802
Well, I don't think that the KTs

22:25.803 --> 22:28.714
will respond to pink buttons
and BeDazzled baby-tees.

22:28.715 --> 22:32.204
- Know your audience.
- This audience looks a little distracted.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.265
I really need to talk to Ash.

22:34.266 --> 22:36.369
This long-distance
relationship is killing me.

22:37.842 --> 22:39.953
You and I don't normally
talk about this kinda stuff.

22:40.172 --> 22:42.245
Oh, is it like, uh,
feminine stuff?

22:42.246 --> 22:45.455
Why do guys always go there? No.
It's got nothing to do with...

22:45.456 --> 22:48.539
Pretend I'm her. Talk to me
like you'd talk to Ashleigh.

22:48.841 --> 22:50.968
Uh... That's just weird.

22:54.390 --> 22:55.958
OK, fine.

22:58.503 --> 22:59.423
Remember Joel?

23:00.350 --> 23:02.756
Well, I didn't get into CRU
Law because he wrote me

23:02.757 --> 23:04.104
a bad letter of recommendation

23:04.105 --> 23:05.741
because he hit on me
over Scotch and cookies

23:05.742 --> 23:06.930
because I didn't tell
him I had a boyfriend

23:06.931 --> 23:08.177
because I was working
for him and I shouldn't

23:08.178 --> 23:09.950
have to tell him because
it's a professional situation

23:09.951 --> 23:11.828
that he made awkward
by asking me out.

23:12.972 --> 23:14.674
Phew! That was really fast.

23:14.675 --> 23:16.198
And because of all of that,

23:16.930 --> 23:20.051
Joel wrote in the letter
that I lack integrity.

23:22.924 --> 23:24.562
I don't know, maybe I do.

23:24.563 --> 23:27.738
Maybe I was stringing him along.
Why do I even care?

23:28.258 --> 23:29.273
Um, hey.

23:31.797 --> 23:34.214
Because you don't lack integrity.

23:35.124 --> 23:36.392
You have to do something.

23:36.393 --> 23:38.354
Because he can't get away
with saying any of that.

23:43.755 --> 23:46.042
Are you running
against Cappie for me

23:46.043 --> 23:47.971
or because you really
want to be KT president?

23:48.371 --> 23:52.070
- What if I said both?
- Then I'd say good luck.

23:55.241 --> 23:56.106
And thanks.

23:57.785 --> 24:00.615
Well, I guess I am
going to law school

24:00.632 --> 24:02.398
to fight for justice.

24:03.132 --> 24:04.931
I might as well start with Joel.

24:13.604 --> 24:15.202
Hey, Cal. Uh...

24:16.578 --> 24:18.168
- It's a good look for you.
- Thanks.

24:19.167 --> 24:22.938
So listen, man, my living
situation is officially screwed,

24:22.939 --> 24:24.718
but, um, not to worry. I

24:24.740 --> 24:26.169
should be out of my room
the next couple of days.

24:26.170 --> 24:27.200
What happened to financial aid?

24:27.201 --> 24:29.793
Um, well, they didn't aid me

24:29.794 --> 24:31.179
as much as I'd expected.

24:33.042 --> 24:34.389
Hey, look, if you
need to stay here...

24:34.390 --> 24:36.664
No, no, no, I'll be fine.
You know what I could do?

24:36.677 --> 24:38.242
I could always beg
my parents for help.

24:38.243 --> 24:39.716
But I don't know.

24:40.251 --> 24:43.195
Easy way out. I'm better than that.
You helped me see that.

24:43.486 --> 24:45.242
Uh... Yeah, you know,
it's no big deal.

24:45.243 --> 24:47.647
Hey, the way you handled
things over spring break...

24:48.472 --> 24:50.076
I'm glad the house
is in your hands.

24:53.013 --> 24:56.443
Yeah, you know, about that, um...

24:59.746 --> 25:02.172
Well, that was
pretty crazy, right?

25:02.173 --> 25:03.036
Wild, man!

25:04.284 --> 25:06.691
Yeah. All right, man.
I'll see you later.

25:14.883 --> 25:16.705
Hey, Becks.
How'd it go with Miriam?

25:17.746 --> 25:18.967
She's pretty senile, huh?

25:20.015 --> 25:21.998
- Is she our new house mom?
- She's not our anything.

25:21.999 --> 25:24.640
And, as president, I've decided
we won't be needing a house mom.

25:24.641 --> 25:26.393
But Nationals told
us we needed one.

25:26.394 --> 25:30.220
- No, Nationals told us we needed one.
- That's what I just said.

25:30.672 --> 25:32.157
As president,
you should listen better.

25:32.526 --> 25:34.720
Dale, you're getting a little
too involved with the house.

25:34.916 --> 25:37.139
Is... It is because of these?

25:37.140 --> 25:38.881
Come on, yeah,
it's above and beyond,

25:38.882 --> 25:40.131
but Abby and some of the gals

25:40.132 --> 25:42.590
said they needed help. So I'm
not one to let a sister down.

25:43.984 --> 25:45.692
That's not what I meant.
What I meant was...

25:45.693 --> 25:47.680
Shut up! You're the best, Dale!

25:47.850 --> 25:50.611
Ladies, as promised,
old sheets for your togas

25:50.612 --> 25:52.138
from the motel across the freeway.

25:52.139 --> 25:54.344
Abby, I thoroughly
bleached that one for you.

26:06.105 --> 26:08.780
You set a meeting with the
admissions office? What the hell?

26:09.370 --> 26:11.926
I want you to explain
to the admissions board

26:11.927 --> 26:14.767
exactly what you meant when
you said I lack integrity.

26:14.768 --> 26:16.702
Casey, their decision
has been made.

26:16.703 --> 26:18.540
I'm sorry if you feel
you were misrepresented,

26:18.541 --> 26:20.383
but I was asked to give
my professional opinion...

26:20.384 --> 26:21.832
And you gave your personal one.

26:21.833 --> 26:23.844
You made it sound like
I lied on my resume

26:23.845 --> 26:25.239
or dipped into the campaign funds,

26:25.724 --> 26:28.625
when in reality, I was working
for you, you made a move,

26:28.779 --> 26:30.114
I told you I had a boyfriend

26:30.115 --> 26:32.257
and suddenly I'm gonna
be a bad lawyer.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.610
You want me to tell them that?

26:33.611 --> 26:34.572
It'll make me sound
like a total...

26:34.591 --> 26:38.001
Exactly. I'm sorry
if I misled you.

26:38.290 --> 26:39.695
It wasn't my intent.

26:39.696 --> 26:41.382
But I don't think you
understand what you did.

26:41.695 --> 26:44.771
You changed my entire
life with one sentence.

26:44.772 --> 26:47.002
And if you're going to
challenge my integrity,

26:47.003 --> 26:48.903
I'd appreciate it if you
showed some yourself.

26:49.517 --> 26:53.358
So either explain to them what you meant,
or rescind the letter.

26:58.425 --> 27:01.774
Maybe my letter was slightly
colored by personal feelings.

27:02.086 --> 27:02.654
I'm sorry.

27:03.322 --> 27:05.734
But rescinding it now
won't make a difference.

27:05.735 --> 27:07.704
- It will to me.
- Miss Cartwright.

27:07.956 --> 27:09.810
I'm sorry, did we have
another appointment?

27:10.357 --> 27:14.803
No, I was just checking something
off of my list before I leave.

27:17.862 --> 27:20.537
- There was no meeting.
- Mm.

27:22.955 --> 27:24.313
Remember when you told me

27:24.314 --> 27:26.237
some people should be
in your life forever

27:26.238 --> 27:27.981
and others just
make an appearance?

27:29.008 --> 27:30.023
Thanks for that.

27:35.529 --> 27:37.868
OK, guys, I know you want
to get ready for the party,

27:38.085 --> 27:39.388
but we gotta do this.

27:40.037 --> 27:41.760
So according to the by-laws,

27:41.961 --> 27:44.193
we've been holding
elections all wrong.

27:44.549 --> 27:46.595
Yeah. We have to vote.

27:46.596 --> 27:49.159
Yeah, but after the speeches.

27:49.437 --> 27:51.117
- That'll do.
- Any questions?

27:51.118 --> 27:53.752
Yeah, is this gonna make
us late to the toga party?

27:57.237 --> 27:57.932
Cappie?

28:01.500 --> 28:03.700
Friends, KTs, brother-men!

28:03.701 --> 28:05.439
Lend me your beers.

28:08.711 --> 28:09.459
Thank you.

28:14.607 --> 28:17.320
I come to bury Spitter,
not to praise him.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.973
I have led the house of
KT with great success.

28:19.974 --> 28:22.774
I think my record as KT
president speaks for itself.

28:23.102 --> 28:26.356
And I ask you,
who has more fun than the KTs?

28:27.217 --> 28:27.952
Anyone?

28:27.953 --> 28:29.457
And I ask you to ask yourself,

28:29.458 --> 28:32.064
is it even possible
to have more fun?

28:32.603 --> 28:37.411
I think not. Therefore,
the only alternative is to have less fun.

28:37.412 --> 28:39.555
And we all know that less fun

28:39.556 --> 28:41.683
is not as fun as the fun
we're already having.

28:41.684 --> 28:43.772
So let's wrap up
this election, and...

28:44.075 --> 28:47.622
To-ga! To-ga! - To-ga! To-ga!

28:54.492 --> 28:55.716
Ah! Theatrics, Spitter.

28:56.328 --> 28:57.318
It's what the people want.

28:59.630 --> 29:00.345
Spitter.

29:06.260 --> 29:07.381
Uh, if elected...

29:20.983 --> 29:23.693
...I promise I will
get you all laid!

29:29.415 --> 29:34.264
Spitt-er! Spitt-er!

29:34.265 --> 29:37.429
Spitt-er! Spitt-er!

29:37.430 --> 29:40.153
To-ga! To-ga! To-ga!

29:40.383 --> 29:42.846
Wait, you guys!
We have to vote now.

29:43.186 --> 29:45.290
We'll vote after the party.
It'll give us more time

29:45.291 --> 29:47.972
to digest these two
powerful speeches.

29:49.064 --> 29:51.153
Looks like I know what
the people want, too.

30:01.455 --> 30:02.910
Oh! You should have seen it, Ash!

30:02.911 --> 30:04.756
I totally put him in his place,

30:04.757 --> 30:06.875
and then just left
him standing there.

30:06.876 --> 30:08.676
It was incredible. I wonder

30:08.677 --> 30:10.501
if this is what Erin
Brockovich felt like.

30:10.823 --> 30:13.267
And now you can leave.

30:13.571 --> 30:15.695
- Yay!
- Why are you panting?

30:15.696 --> 30:19.413
Who the hell would build a
building without an elevator?

30:19.414 --> 30:20.248
It makes no sense.

30:20.641 --> 30:24.001
But with all these stairs, you
have to see my new New York ass.

30:24.351 --> 30:27.286
I will be out there soon, I just
have a few more boxes and...

30:28.967 --> 30:30.518
- Cappie.
- No!

30:30.519 --> 30:32.368
Forget about Cappie and drive.

30:32.369 --> 30:34.887
No, it is Cappie.
He's walking right toward me.

30:34.888 --> 30:36.174
Remember, Spitter's not gonna buy

30:36.175 --> 30:39.226
you fancy microbrews.
He can't even buy you brew.

30:39.866 --> 30:41.288
Run to your car! Run!

30:41.289 --> 30:43.558
I've got one more thing
on my to-do list, Ash.

30:43.559 --> 30:45.853
Well, then put it on speaker!
Put it on speaker!

30:51.996 --> 30:55.038
- Nice toga.
- Well played.

30:55.905 --> 30:59.233
- I thought you were...
- Leaving? Yes, I am.

30:59.798 --> 31:02.690
- Case, listen...
- No, no, you've had your chance.

31:02.691 --> 31:03.882
Now, I have something
I need to say.

31:06.230 --> 31:08.569
This was the worst
summer of my life.

31:09.074 --> 31:11.950
- Our breakup crushed me.
- You think it was easy for me?

31:11.951 --> 31:14.781
And now I'm leaving tomorrow,
and you can't even say goodbye.

31:14.782 --> 31:16.181
- I don't know if now...
- Uh-uh!

31:16.547 --> 31:18.421
Why couldn't you say
something? Anything?

31:18.422 --> 31:20.225
You had all summer to say it,
but you didn't.

31:20.226 --> 31:24.043
You know, so I guess this
is me saying it to you.

31:26.215 --> 31:27.166
Goodbye, Cap.

31:28.175 --> 31:30.990
Yeah! Bye, Cap! You suck!

31:31.908 --> 31:33.309
This is Ashleigh, by the way.

31:34.941 --> 31:37.110
Now, I can move on to Washington.

31:37.111 --> 31:39.661
- Did he know it was me?
- Hold on, I have another call.

31:40.601 --> 31:43.194
- Oh, my gosh, it's a university number.
- Put it on three-way!

31:44.048 --> 31:47.120
Please? I have no television.
You're like a real reality show.

31:47.503 --> 31:48.753
Yeah, I don't think
that's a good idea.

31:49.067 --> 31:51.410
- Please? Please?
- OK.

31:52.295 --> 31:53.359
Hello?

32:05.938 --> 32:07.536
Who wants a refill, huh?

32:08.628 --> 32:10.397
Brought to you by
Cappie the Carefree.

32:10.398 --> 32:12.664
We're good, actually. Spitter
just brought us these, so...

32:13.352 --> 32:16.186
Wonderful. More for me.

32:19.144 --> 32:21.136
Mm. Hey, Beav! Buddy.

32:21.494 --> 32:24.162
Just remember when you're voting
who saved you a trip to the bar.

32:24.163 --> 32:27.082
Ah. Thank you, Cap, but we're
gonna hit the dance floor.

32:27.348 --> 32:29.275
Go on ahead,
I'll meet you out there.

32:33.178 --> 32:35.100
Spitter, Spitter! Thank you.

32:35.298 --> 32:37.442
Your campaign promise
already paid off.

32:37.443 --> 32:40.659
I just hooked up with that
Tri Pi in the bathroom!

32:40.660 --> 32:43.527
- Glad I could be of service.
- What? Beav!

32:43.732 --> 32:46.360
Spitter had nothing to do with that!
She's a Tri Pi.

32:46.361 --> 32:49.202
Cap, he promised,
then it happened.

32:49.402 --> 32:51.092
I wouldn't call
that a coincidence.

32:51.093 --> 32:52.470
That's exactly what it's called!

32:54.462 --> 32:55.799
Spitter, you got my vote.

32:57.679 --> 32:58.845
Et tu, Beaver?

32:59.256 --> 33:01.698
Hey, I never specified
when they get laid,

33:01.699 --> 33:04.487
so technically, the next
time any of them have sex,

33:04.488 --> 33:06.559
I'll be living up to
my campaign promise.

33:06.560 --> 33:09.938
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe I'll just
go celibate to prove you a liar.

33:09.939 --> 33:10.790
Yeah.

33:17.822 --> 33:21.187
Another campaign promise fulfilled.
You're welcome, Heath.

33:21.670 --> 33:24.034
Calvin was already my boyfriend!

33:24.397 --> 33:26.793
- What's he talking about?
- Spitter lacks experience.

33:26.794 --> 33:28.113
Stick with what works.

33:28.114 --> 33:30.226
Your loyalty to me
as your Pledge Educator

33:30.227 --> 33:31.608
- will not be forgotten.
- I

33:31.609 --> 33:34.545
was your leader's leader.
Your loyalty's to me.

33:46.217 --> 33:49.910
Cappie's reign must end.
Change is on the horizon.

33:49.911 --> 33:52.437
Beware the fries, they're starch.

33:52.874 --> 33:55.257
- Hm...
- I don't know.

33:55.868 --> 33:56.440
I'm done.

33:57.843 --> 34:00.728
Hey, hey. I'm calling
off this election.

34:00.729 --> 34:02.724
- What? You can't do that.
- Yeah, I can.

34:02.725 --> 34:04.412
Technically,
I'm still the president.

34:04.413 --> 34:06.696
I have a chair in the
shape of my butt,

34:06.697 --> 34:09.670
- so I can do whatever I want.
- You're being such a dictator

34:09.670 --> 34:10.983
because you're
scared of the future.

34:11.190 --> 34:13.746
You can't be KT president forever.

34:14.014 --> 34:16.639
Time doesn't stand
still for anyone.

34:16.876 --> 34:18.310
- You're not Peter Pan.
- Yeah,

34:18.317 --> 34:21.072
all children grow up.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

34:21.072 --> 34:23.476
I get it. Why do you care?

34:24.513 --> 34:28.047
Because it's killing me to imagine
not having my sister around.

34:28.049 --> 34:29.388
How is it not killing you?

34:41.603 --> 34:42.648
I love this song!

34:42.649 --> 34:43.913
Everybody, come dance!

34:49.453 --> 34:50.864
Hey, let's dance.

34:53.005 --> 34:55.868
Oh, my God! I'm obsessed
with foot massages lately!

34:55.869 --> 34:57.397
Oh, my God, and they're so cheap!

34:57.398 --> 35:00.118
Oh, my God! I have really
strong hands. So just...

35:00.523 --> 35:02.107
...let me know. Whenever.

35:03.635 --> 35:04.330
Dale?

35:05.763 --> 35:06.599
What are you doing here?

35:08.075 --> 35:09.616
Uh... what...?

35:10.218 --> 35:11.736
Making good progress,
until you came along.

35:12.259 --> 35:15.814
This party is exclusively for Omega Chis,
KTs, Tri Pis and ZBZs.

35:15.815 --> 35:17.983
Oh, no. It's all good.
I rolled with Abby and Betsy.

35:17.984 --> 35:19.563
And check it out.
I'm wearing our letters.

35:22.419 --> 35:24.339
You are not a ZBZ!

35:24.340 --> 35:26.695
You're definitely
not our rent boy.

35:26.962 --> 35:28.359
They're never gonna
see you like that.

35:28.608 --> 35:29.884
You're basically one of the girls,

35:30.187 --> 35:33.421
- except we're pretty and thin.
- You did not just call me fat.

35:33.422 --> 35:35.596
- Oh, yes, I did.
- You know what? I can diet,

35:35.597 --> 35:38.577
- but you'll always be ugly on the inside.
- Take off that shirt!

35:39.114 --> 35:41.449
- Not for you, missy!
- Take off that shirt!

35:41.450 --> 35:43.466
- Take it off!
- Hey! What's going on?

35:43.467 --> 35:45.297
You think you're one of us,
but you're not!

35:45.298 --> 35:47.793
- You're not even in the Greek system!
- Not officially,

35:47.794 --> 35:50.793
but I live with the Greek system,
and I work in it, too!

35:50.794 --> 35:53.049
I am the eyes and ears of this
whole institution, my friend!

35:53.050 --> 35:55.957
How else would I know the KTs
helped elect Calvin president

35:55.958 --> 35:57.851
to make this whole truce happen?
Did you know that?

35:57.852 --> 36:02.090
- I don't think so!
- KTs helped elect Calvin?

36:05.727 --> 36:06.433
What?

36:27.260 --> 36:28.636
Hello.

36:30.746 --> 36:32.496
They're still voting at the house.

36:32.497 --> 36:33.627
Beaver keeps losing count?

36:33.628 --> 36:35.333
Yeah. It's worse
than Florida in 2000.

36:38.731 --> 36:42.600
Look, I'm sorry for being
such a dick-tator lately.

36:43.665 --> 36:45.744
I haven't been that
respectful about your sister.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.564
Yeah, I wanted to
punch you in the face

36:48.193 --> 36:50.484
for not seeing that,
but I couldn't.

36:51.737 --> 36:53.635
Yeah, I know. You got weak wrists.

36:53.636 --> 36:57.643
I mean morally. And that's why
I was running against you,

36:58.330 --> 37:00.762
to hurt you in another way.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.335
I would've rather you punched me.

37:03.624 --> 37:06.286
We'll always be friends,
no matter who wins.

37:09.479 --> 37:11.847
Look, I think you should know why
I didn't say anything to Case.

37:13.161 --> 37:14.415
It's pretty simple. I mean...

37:15.928 --> 37:17.955
All I could say was goodbye.

37:20.848 --> 37:21.945
And that would have
been it for us.

37:23.229 --> 37:24.774
Over, forever.

37:25.835 --> 37:27.350
So your answer was to do nothing?

37:28.809 --> 37:32.425
Look, I didn't want
things to end or change.

37:32.698 --> 37:35.002
She was right during spring break.
Change scares me.

37:38.803 --> 37:40.056
I'm scared I'm gonna lose her.

37:43.174 --> 37:46.152
Cappie, you are
losing her forever.

38:04.495 --> 38:05.665
Look, I'm sorry.

38:06.695 --> 38:10.006
I should've told you about the
truce arrangement with the KTs.

38:10.007 --> 38:13.054
- I really... I screwed up.
- Hey, man.

38:13.360 --> 38:15.795
I'm gonna be moving out of the house.
I'm an alum now.

38:17.647 --> 38:19.396
So good luck with all that.

38:31.103 --> 38:31.799
Casey?

38:32.865 --> 38:33.980
Cap?

38:39.094 --> 38:39.893
- Look...
- Oh!

38:42.288 --> 38:43.685
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

38:44.091 --> 38:46.230
For everything. For "Nice hat,"

38:46.231 --> 38:47.825
For... especially
for Cinco de Mayo...

38:47.826 --> 38:50.051
- Cap...
- No, no, listen. This is my turn, OK?

38:52.045 --> 38:52.987
You called me out on

38:52.988 --> 38:54.883
spring break and you were right.
I was scared.

38:55.126 --> 38:57.447
And I know that there's a lot of
things that we have to work on,

38:57.448 --> 38:58.370
and I know it's gonna be

38:58.371 --> 38:59.925
really hard with you
living in Washington...

38:59.926 --> 39:04.081
I... I got into CRU.
I've already decided to stay.

39:06.035 --> 39:06.729
That's great!

39:07.552 --> 39:09.251
Wait, so we can try again.

39:09.252 --> 39:10.403
But not because of you.

39:11.506 --> 39:13.130
I never wanted to leave here.

39:13.204 --> 39:15.142
I just wanted to go to law school.

39:17.550 --> 39:18.924
Is it a little about me?

39:21.551 --> 39:23.285
Nothing's changed.

39:24.164 --> 39:24.934
I...

39:25.976 --> 39:28.564
I can't just try again
with you after everything

39:28.565 --> 39:31.474
because you haven't done
anything to earn that.

39:32.750 --> 39:34.545
If we got back together,

39:34.546 --> 39:36.218
I'd be the one
questioning my integrity.

39:36.715 --> 39:38.049
We have three more years now.

39:39.473 --> 39:41.175
I can change. I will change.

39:42.667 --> 39:43.964
And I believe that you can.

39:44.964 --> 39:46.914
But until you do, that's all talk.

39:48.722 --> 39:52.652
So then... do we have any shot?

40:00.385 --> 40:02.650
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

40:04.111 --> 40:04.709
Maybe.

40:08.989 --> 40:10.248
Well, at least you're staying.

40:12.084 --> 40:13.106
Something to hope for.

40:18.261 --> 40:19.612
Uh, the door's open, Cap.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.878
I appreciate you leaving
it open for me, Case.

40:21.879 --> 40:23.308
I can change. I'll show you.

40:24.264 --> 40:26.188
I'm gonna turn that
"Maybe" Into a "Yes."

40:27.284 --> 40:30.780
I meant the door... over there.

40:34.789 --> 40:35.318
Right.

40:57.910 --> 41:00.310
Perhaps I went a little too far.

41:00.311 --> 41:02.375
You're right, I'm not a ZBZ.

41:03.226 --> 41:04.558
I wouldn't mind being with one.

41:05.070 --> 41:07.376
But maybe I am just an outsider.

41:07.966 --> 41:11.655
- You'll clean this up for me, right?
- Why don't you like me?

41:13.389 --> 41:15.736
Because you're weird.
And as president

41:15.737 --> 41:17.296
of the number one
sorority on this campus,

41:17.297 --> 41:20.600
this entire house is now
resting on my shoulders. Alone.

41:20.601 --> 41:23.304
So I need to make sure we
look good and you don't help.

41:23.628 --> 41:26.398
Why does the Greek system focus
so much on image and status

41:26.399 --> 41:29.602
- and stupid skinny ties.
- The Greek system?

41:29.931 --> 41:31.241
Please, try planet Earth.

41:31.694 --> 41:33.982
And I didn't make the rules,
I just benefit from them.

41:34.762 --> 41:36.256
And tend to ignore
those who don't.

41:36.514 --> 41:38.070
You're not a nice person.

41:39.920 --> 41:41.674
But you think if you
put on a skinny tie,

41:41.675 --> 41:43.402
girls of this world
will just swoon?

41:43.403 --> 41:45.611
That might work on some girls,
but not a ZBZ.

41:45.911 --> 41:49.110
So you're saying I need better
bait to catch better fish?

41:49.864 --> 41:52.325
I don't really do blue-collar metaphors,
but, sure, whatevs.

41:52.904 --> 41:56.682
Hey, Case. So sorry to see you go!
What time's the big send-off?

41:56.683 --> 41:58.487
- And when will my room be ready?
- Oh.

41:58.863 --> 42:00.338
I've actually decided to stay.

42:03.639 --> 42:06.228
What? Not here, you're not!

42:06.641 --> 42:08.016
Thank you, Jesus.

42:09.816 --> 42:13.505
I know, Ash. I won't be
able to visit you by train

42:13.506 --> 42:15.850
from CRU, but we'll
still talk every day.

42:16.671 --> 42:18.192
OK, fine. Every half hour.

42:18.193 --> 42:21.806
- Are you sure that's the right decision?
- I have no idea.

42:22.830 --> 42:24.896
Hey, Ash, I gotta go.
I'll call you later, OK?

42:24.897 --> 42:27.143
- Say hi to her for me.
- Wait, wait. Rusty says hi.

42:27.618 --> 42:28.990
Oh! Hey, watch it!

42:31.305 --> 42:35.029
Oh! Oh, OK. Yeah.
Ash says thanks for her whistle.

42:35.030 --> 42:35.649
Yeah.

42:37.384 --> 42:40.035
I guess I'm not the lone
Cartwright on campus.

42:40.343 --> 42:42.403
I hope I'm not
cramping your style.

42:42.404 --> 42:45.036
Just don't embarrass me by
showing up at the same parties.

42:45.177 --> 42:49.162
- Embarrass you how?
- You know, 'cause you graduated.

42:49.628 --> 42:52.786
- It'd be kind of pathetic.
- OK.

42:55.252 --> 42:57.712
Oh, what happened with the
election? Did you win?

42:59.054 --> 43:02.390
Cappie assured me this is
gonna be his last year.

43:03.014 --> 43:05.292
As president, or...?

43:06.900 --> 43:08.196
He didn't specify.

43:11.110 --> 43:14.948
Well, something to hope for.
