Claudia:
So, I finished going through
all the old transcripts,

41:06.289 --> 41:08.596
and you never talked about
nightmares on the air.

41:08.640 --> 41:12.121
But in one of the letters,
they called you "Margaret."

41:12.165 --> 41:14.297
Have you ever
gone by Margaret?

41:14.341 --> 41:18.998
Um, not really, not since
right after grad school.

41:19.041 --> 41:22.001
I was trying a thing to make me
sound more grown-up.

41:24.003 --> 41:27.223
Actually, uh,
let me call you back.

Oh, my God.

Um, I think I know who's been
sending me these letters.

41:59.560 --> 42:01.040
You do?

42:01.083 --> 42:03.172
It's not a listener.

42:03.216 --> 42:05.523
It's a-a former
client of mine.

42:05.566 --> 42:06.698
Well, that's good.

42:06.741 --> 42:08.656
I mean, not "good" good,

42:08.700 --> 42:10.745
but good in the sense
that we can now

42:10.789 --> 42:12.312
tell the police who it is.

42:12.355 --> 42:13.879
No, we can't.

42:13.922 --> 42:15.489
Why not?

42:15.533 --> 42:18.013
Because...

42:18.057 --> 42:20.450
he died three years ago.
