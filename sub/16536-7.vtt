WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.545
<i>Previously on "Designated Survivor"...</i>

00:02.670 --> 00:04.380
MacLeish turned down
Speaker of the House.

00:04.505 --> 00:07.258
- What about the vice presidency?
- I would be honored.

00:07.383 --> 00:08.551
MacLeish? For VP?

00:08.676 --> 00:10.136
They want to start the vetting.

00:10.261 --> 00:13.889
I have a source claiming that Leo Kirkman
is not the president's son.

00:14.015 --> 00:15.433
We have Majid Nassar.

00:15.558 --> 00:17.810
- Effective interrogation takes time.
- You've got 24 hours.

00:17.935 --> 00:20.312
You signed on to this, and you don't know
the person who set you up?

00:20.438 --> 00:22.314
He said his name was Catalan.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.483
If you tell anyone, he'll kill you, too.

00:24.608 --> 00:25.818
- What is it?
- Nassar.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.570
And I found him like this.

00:48.966 --> 00:51.093
I want the name
of every single person that came

00:51.218 --> 00:53.304
in contact with that food.
I want tox, I want DNA,

00:53.429 --> 00:55.973
I want fingerprints. I want video-camera
surveillance footage.

00:56.098 --> 00:58.225
Every single result comes to me.

01:02.813 --> 01:04.482
Still wrapping things up.

01:04.982 --> 01:07.860
Whoever blew up the Capitol
must have murdered Nassar

01:07.985 --> 01:10.237
before he told anyone else the truth.

01:10.613 --> 01:12.448
He told us, Jason.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.699
I know.

01:13.824 --> 01:16.118
But what good does that do us now?
We have no proof.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.704
Which is why we need to press on
with the only lead Nassar gave us.

01:18.829 --> 01:19.872
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.832
Lieutenant's outside.
Watch your back.

01:25.961 --> 01:28.881
But if we're the only ones
he told about Catalan,

01:29.006 --> 01:31.675
it's only a matter of time
before they come for us.

01:44.355 --> 01:48.150
When the New York Yankees
took the field a week after 9/11,

01:48.275 --> 01:50.528
they allowed us
to move forward with our lives.

01:50.653 --> 01:53.155
It was sports, not speeches,

01:53.280 --> 01:55.866
that allowed us to get back on our feet.

01:56.283 --> 01:59.161
So when I heard that our athletes
were going to Moscow

01:59.286 --> 02:02.748
to compete in the International
Track and Field Championships,

02:02.873 --> 02:04.291
I wanted to thank them myself.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.335
Coach Weston.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.089
It's an honor, Mr. President.
We're extremely proud.

02:10.214 --> 02:11.882
Especially after what
our nation's been through.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.175
The honor is mine.

02:13.884 --> 02:16.554
Coach Weston,
show them what we've got.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.685
You must get this all the time,

02:22.810 --> 02:26.272
but back in '92, when you broke
the world record for the 400 meters,

02:26.397 --> 02:29.400
that was one of the most
incredible things I'd ever seen.

02:29.525 --> 02:32.403
- I appreciate that, Mr. President.
- Excuse me, Mr. President.

02:32.528 --> 02:34.113
Congressman MacLeish
and his wife have arrived.

02:34.238 --> 02:35.739
Thank you, Wyatt.

02:35.865 --> 02:38.617
I'm sorry. I have to step away.
It was a pleasure to meet you.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.703
Remember, Mr. President,
leaders are made, not born.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.289
- We're rooting for you, sir.
- Thank you.

02:44.331 --> 02:47.793
I don't know what it was I ate,
but whatever it was, I was sick as a dog.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.003
And let me guess.

02:49.545 --> 02:52.131
Like a gentleman,
he held your hair back the whole time.

02:52.256 --> 02:55.634
No. He put me in a cab on my own,

02:55.759 --> 02:57.219
and he went back into the restaurant,

02:57.344 --> 03:00.431
and he sat there
until they shut the kitchen down

03:00.556 --> 03:02.224
- so that no one else would get sick.
- Oh.

03:02.349 --> 03:05.227
- And that is when I knew...
- That I would be a good health inspector.

03:07.771 --> 03:09.815
How about you guys?
H-How did you first meet?

03:09.940 --> 03:11.609
We met in college.

03:11.734 --> 03:14.987
My sorority sister
came home one day and said,

03:15.112 --> 03:18.240
"I have the perfect guy for you.
He's cute. He is funny."

03:18.365 --> 03:19.658
- Mm-hmm.
- And that was...

03:19.783 --> 03:21.994
My roommate.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.496
Who could not have been
less interested in me.

03:24.622 --> 03:25.831
I don't believe that.

03:25.956 --> 03:29.460
Well, to soften the blow,
he introduced me to Peter.

03:29.585 --> 03:32.463
I like to think I reaped the benefits
of my roommate's poor judgment.

03:32.588 --> 03:33.422
Mm-hmm.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.008
How do you think it's going?

03:36.133 --> 03:38.594
Well, probably the same
as when you asked 10 minutes ago.

03:39.762 --> 03:42.139
First game back,
the Wizards are already bombing.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.476
I'm sorry. Poor choice of words.

03:45.601 --> 03:47.311
I'm telling you, we're never gonna find

03:47.436 --> 03:49.355
a better candidate
for vice president than MacLeish.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.689
<i>You</i> know that <i>. I</i> know that.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.358
But POTUS has never been
in this position before.

03:52.483 --> 03:54.526
- He wants to be thorough.
- I just wish we could fast-forward

03:54.652 --> 03:58.030
to the part where we give
the country some good news, for once.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.531
Especially with elections coming up.

03:59.657 --> 04:00.699
No!

04:00.824 --> 04:03.702
Wall can't play through that one!
He's got to get Porter or Beal involved.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.996
- Porter was late filling the lane.
- What?

04:06.413 --> 04:07.998
Men don't own sports.

04:11.168 --> 04:12.670
Aaron Shore.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.132
Yeah.

04:18.676 --> 04:21.470
Yeah. Thank you. I'll let him know.

04:21.803 --> 04:22.846
Damn it.

04:23.681 --> 04:24.890
What is it?

04:25.015 --> 04:27.309
Hey, Aaron, I need five minutes
with the president. It's personal.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.520
The president's not doing
personal tonight.

04:31.355 --> 04:34.316
- Do you mind if I ask a question?
- Sure. Go ahead.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.319
I-I-- I guess I'm just curious

04:37.444 --> 04:39.196
what it's like really living here,

04:39.321 --> 04:42.992
you know, with your family
and your marriage, the scrutiny.

04:43.117 --> 04:44.410
We're still trying to figure that out.

04:46.203 --> 04:47.705
Sorry to interrupt.

04:47.830 --> 04:50.374
- Mr. President, a word, please?
- Of course. Will you excuse me?

04:52.501 --> 04:54.920
So, where is the roommate now?

04:55.045 --> 04:56.880
Majid Nassar is dead?

04:57.006 --> 05:00.259
How the hell is that even possible?
He was in our custody.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.928
FBI's investigating.
They say he was poisoned in his cell.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.555
Son of a bitch.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.516
I can get Deputy Director Atwood here
within the hour for a briefing.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.393
Do it. Now.

05:10.519 --> 05:11.687
Aaron.

05:12.313 --> 05:15.024
Not a word of this to anyone.
Not until we have some answers.

05:16.692 --> 05:19.361
I am so sorry. This is gonna take longer
than I had hoped.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.406
Oh no, no. Don't apologize.
We understand. Duty calls.

05:22.531 --> 05:23.699
Mr. President,

05:24.491 --> 05:27.119
I know I'm not VP yet, and...
and maybe I never will be,

05:27.244 --> 05:30.372
but if there's ever anything I can do
to help you ease your burden,

05:30.497 --> 05:31.874
I hope you won't hesitate to ask.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.250
Thank you, Peter.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.253
Again, I am so sorry. Excuse me.

05:37.254 --> 05:38.255
OK...

05:40.591 --> 05:41.592
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

05:42.718 --> 05:43.886
All right.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.638
The president wants a briefing
on the Nassar murder.

05:46.764 --> 05:48.349
- Now?
- Yeah.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.143
Okay, you need to tell him.
Everything we know.

05:51.268 --> 05:54.313
The president is expecting me
to brief him on a murder investigation.

05:54.438 --> 05:55.981
He's gonna think I'm crazy

05:56.106 --> 05:58.609
if I blindside him
with theories about MacLeish.

05:58.734 --> 06:01.612
They're not theories. Peter MacLeish
has closer ties to the attack

06:01.737 --> 06:03.822
than Nassar ever did,
and we have evidence of that.

06:03.947 --> 06:07.826
It is only a matter of time before he's
a heartbeat away from the presidency.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.286
Kirkman needs to know that.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.123
Wish me luck.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.543
Good luck.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.557
The president's
ready for you, sir.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.647
- Mr. President.
- Thank you, Wyatt.

06:36.772 --> 06:39.650
Deputy Director, please tell me
that you've got some answers.

06:39.775 --> 06:41.443
I believe I do, sir.

06:41.568 --> 06:42.986
That's good news.

06:48.659 --> 06:52.162
Congressman MacLeish.
I wasn't expecting to see you.

06:52.663 --> 06:53.664
The congressman has served

06:53.789 --> 06:55.958
on the Subcommittees for
Terrorism and Homeland Security.

06:56.083 --> 06:59.878
Given the circumstances, I felt it was
appropriate that he joined us tonight.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.672
Yes, of course.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.800
What the hell happened with Nassar?

07:05.175 --> 07:08.220
Well, we don't have much intel
at the moment,

07:08.345 --> 07:11.014
but I promise you
we're looking into every possibility.

07:11.682 --> 07:14.351
Did we get anything
out of him before he died?

07:15.185 --> 07:16.687
He wasn't very cooperative.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.398
I get that he wasn't cooperative.

07:19.523 --> 07:23.068
You asked for the authority
to interrogate him. I gave it to you.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.612
I assumed you knew what you were doing.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.823
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.033
I wish I could say more.

07:32.494 --> 07:34.913
Deputy Director, when you walked in,

07:35.038 --> 07:36.415
you said you thought you had answers.

07:36.540 --> 07:40.711
I meant that we are still working on it.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.422
Fine.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.048
That'll be all.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.384
Get back to me
when you've actually got something.

07:47.509 --> 07:48.385
Yes, sir.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.220
Mr. President.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.222
Congressman.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.442
That didn't make any sense.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.277
Oh, Mr. President,
I have to believe the FBI

08:05.402 --> 08:07.738
is doing everything they can
to solve this.

08:08.864 --> 08:10.699
I'm sure you're right.

08:37.768 --> 08:40.102
This is becoming a habit.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.440
I remember when you used
to wake up to me working.

08:43.565 --> 08:46.693
Trust me, I liked it better that way.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.862
What's going on?

08:50.280 --> 08:53.075
You ever get that weird feeling
when you think someone's lying to you?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.785
- Mm.
- Of course you do.

08:54.910 --> 08:57.120
- You're a lawyer.
- Who are you thinking?

08:57.704 --> 08:58.664
Jason Atwood.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.832
Deputy Director, FBI.

09:00.958 --> 09:02.459
Why do you think he's lying?

09:03.293 --> 09:06.463
Can't say exactly. I just have
this feeling that something's not right.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.800
Atwood pressed me really hard
to interrogate Majid Nassar.

09:09.925 --> 09:12.010
12 hours later, Nassar's dead.

09:12.135 --> 09:15.013
Atwood can't answer a single
question about how or why.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.723
It just doesn't feel right.

09:18.141 --> 09:21.019
Well, when I'm trying a case,

09:21.144 --> 09:23.689
I only bring up what I can prove.

09:23.814 --> 09:26.400
Atwood's not gonna give you any answers
that he can't stand behind.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.443
I'd just give him some time.

09:36.326 --> 09:37.828
Morning, Mr. President.

09:38.161 --> 09:39.830
Did you get any sleep?

09:39.955 --> 09:41.623
I'm sure that bedroom's
seen a lot of things,

09:41.748 --> 09:44.001
but I don't think a good night's sleep
is one of them.

09:44.459 --> 09:47.045
Look, I need you to stay on top
of the Nassar investigation.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.631
Use every resource our intelligence
community has to offer.

09:49.756 --> 09:50.841
Absolutely, sir.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.511
- Good morning, Wyatt.
- Good morning, Mr. President.

09:55.345 --> 09:58.348
Mr. President, I just got off the phone
with our ambassador in Russia.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.642
Coach Weston was arrested
upon landing in Moscow.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.644
What? On what charges?

10:02.769 --> 10:04.896
Customs found 20 vials
of HGH in his bag.

10:05.022 --> 10:07.024
They're saying that he's been
supplying his athletes

10:07.149 --> 10:08.233
with performance-enhancing drugs.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.068
And the Russians are complaining?
That's ironic.

10:10.193 --> 10:11.069
I don't believe it.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.739
Whether it's true or not,
the head of the U.S.A. team

10:13.864 --> 10:16.408
was arrested on foreign soil.
This is a national embarrassment.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.243
The State Department
needs to get him a lawyer.

10:18.368 --> 10:21.079
- They're sending one over right now.
- I want to talk to them right away.

10:21.204 --> 10:23.498
I meant what I said last night.
Coach Weston is a national hero.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.791
Yes, sir.

10:26.543 --> 10:30.088
I wouldn't be surprised
if the president tried to fire me.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.882
How the hell am I gonna talk
about MacLeish

10:32.007 --> 10:33.717
if MacLeish is standing right there?

10:34.384 --> 10:36.845
I got to get another meeting
as soon as possible.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.096
Where are we with Catalan?

10:38.221 --> 10:39.890
TIDE and Interpol
came up with nothing.

10:40.015 --> 10:42.768
The only hits on any watch lists
are old Spanish radicals.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.936
Did you run him
as a specially designated national?

10:45.062 --> 10:46.021
Nothing.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.939
How the hell are we gonna get lucky?

10:48.065 --> 10:52.069
Well, not everything the CIA knows
comes up on the TIDE database, so...

10:52.402 --> 10:54.112
- You got a source?
- I do.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.906
I'm gonna see him this afternoon.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.949
He just doesn't know it yet.

10:58.075 --> 10:59.117
<i>Let me know as soon</i>

10:59.242 --> 11:01.119
as Weston speaks with the lawyers
from the embassy.

11:01.244 --> 11:02.913
This is a top priority for the president.

11:03.038 --> 11:04.915
Hey, I really need that five minutes
with the president.

11:05.040 --> 11:08.210
Now is not a good time, Seth.
A national icon's on his way to the Gulag.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.630
Yeah, fully aware. I have 50 reporters
waiting for me to comment on that.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.298
- But I really need to talk to him.
- I told you,

11:13.423 --> 11:15.467
the president has no time
for personal requests right now.

11:15.592 --> 11:18.470
You don't understand. This is not <i>me</i>
personal. This is <i>POTUS</i> personal.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.764
That reporter I met
the other night, Lisa.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.265
She needs a comment on a story.

11:22.391 --> 11:23.975
- What story?
- A couple of days ago,

11:24.101 --> 11:26.937
she says a criminal-defense
lawyer came to see her.

11:27.062 --> 11:30.399
He says that his client, who he will
not name, is Leo's biological father.

11:33.276 --> 11:34.277
All right.

11:34.403 --> 11:36.446
You can have your five minutes, now.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.615
Is it true?

11:40.075 --> 11:41.868
His name is Jeffrey Myers.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.496
Alex was seeing him when we met.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.832
She broke it off
right before we started dating.

11:46.957 --> 11:49.960
When we found out Alex was pregnant,
the timing of that scared her.

11:50.877 --> 11:54.172
She asked me if I wanted to take a test.
I said no. Nothing would change.

11:54.297 --> 11:55.298
I loved her.

11:55.424 --> 11:57.759
Well, the good thing is,
without a paternity test,

11:57.884 --> 12:00.345
- they don't have anything concrete.
- He doesn't need it.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.681
Once the story goes public,
it's gonna raise questions

12:02.806 --> 12:04.349
that won't go away
until they're answered.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.101
What's he in prison for?

12:06.226 --> 12:09.771
He was convicted two years ago of felony
tax evasion. Five-year sentence.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.773
For tax evasion?
How much was he hiding?

12:11.898 --> 12:13.358
$46 million.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.193
Seth, this reporter...

12:15.318 --> 12:17.446
- Lisa Jordan from the <i>Chronicle.</i>
- Right. What does she want?

12:17.571 --> 12:21.366
A comment. I can hold her off,
but I don't have any ground to stand on.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.368
The story doesn't have
any national-security implications.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.746
No. Just family ones.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.665
Hold her off as long as you can.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.752
I don't want Alex and Leo
getting blindsided by this.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.172
- Uh...
- What?

12:35.297 --> 12:38.049
Well, sir, the...
the first lady already knows

12:38.175 --> 12:39.718
that Myers has been talking.

12:39.843 --> 12:40.886
What?

12:41.011 --> 12:43.013
A week ago.
We were talking about it,

12:43.138 --> 12:45.640
and she promised me
that she would talk to you.

12:48.143 --> 12:50.812
You knew that son of a bitch Myers
was making noise a week ago,

12:50.937 --> 12:52.022
and you didn't tell me?

12:52.147 --> 12:55.400
Oh, w-when was I supposed to do that?
Between Majid Nassar,

12:55.525 --> 12:56.818
uh, the governors
holding you hostage...

12:56.943 --> 12:59.905
Come on, Alex. That's not fair.
We have a deal.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.824
No matter what's happening with us,
our children come first.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.243
Don't you dare throw that at me.

13:05.368 --> 13:09.414
My whole life has been about
protecting them, especially now.

13:09.539 --> 13:12.209
17 years trying
to shield Leo from this.

13:12.959 --> 13:16.463
All it took was a month
in the White House to undo it.

13:19.382 --> 13:22.219
Maybe the mistake was keeping it from him
in the first place.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.600
Seth thinks he can buy us some time.

13:28.725 --> 13:31.269
Time? He can get us
all the time in the world.

13:31.394 --> 13:34.731
This is not gonna go away.
You are the president now.

13:35.398 --> 13:38.360
Why don't I try and talk to Myers,
see if I can fix this?

13:38.485 --> 13:40.862
No, no. That's not a good idea.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.573
Well, do you have a better one?

13:44.908 --> 13:45.742
What?!

13:46.743 --> 13:47.953
What is it?

13:48.078 --> 13:50.622
Acting Secretary of State Paulsen
has brought James Carrera with her.

13:50.747 --> 13:51.623
Why?

13:51.748 --> 13:54.000
They wouldn't tell me, sir,
but they said it was urgent.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.419
Thank you, Wyatt.

13:59.589 --> 14:02.884
- Director Carrera. Secretary Paulsen.
- Mr. President.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.637
- Do we have an update on Al-Sakar?
- No, sir.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.764
We need to talk to you
about Brad Weston.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.308
Okay.

14:10.433 --> 14:13.103
We need to do everything we can
to bring him back home immediately.

14:13.228 --> 14:14.479
Is there something I should know?

14:14.604 --> 14:16.565
Sir, Brad Weston is one of ours.

14:18.108 --> 14:20.110
He works for the CIA.

14:24.114 --> 14:25.615
He's a spy?

14:28.952 --> 14:31.663
I can't believe Coach Weston is a spy.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.498
He's not an officer. He's a resource.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.834
As a world-class coach,
he gets into rooms

14:35.959 --> 14:37.836
with ministers, oligarchs, presidents,

14:37.961 --> 14:39.838
and when he returns to America,

14:39.963 --> 14:41.840
he shares with us
what he's seen and heard.

14:41.965 --> 14:43.508
But what about the drugs?

14:43.633 --> 14:45.510
We suspect they were planted

14:45.635 --> 14:47.971
to give the Russians
a pretense for his arrest.

14:48.096 --> 14:49.848
What's the maximum sentence?

14:49.973 --> 14:51.600
For drugs? Life.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.310
For espionage? Death.

14:54.311 --> 14:56.646
Without our help,
he's never leaving Russia.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.503
So, are pinball people just too old
to play video games?

15:21.129 --> 15:22.339
We're a dying breed.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.674
What do you want, Hannah?

15:25.133 --> 15:26.217
I need your help.

15:26.343 --> 15:28.011
Sorry. Can't do it.

15:28.136 --> 15:31.097
FBI is persona non grata at the moment.

15:31.514 --> 15:35.060
Your boss made a play
to wrestle Nassar away from the CIA.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.395
We take that personally.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.521
All right.

15:38.980 --> 15:41.107
I'll just have to find Catalan myself.

15:42.484 --> 15:43.360
Hey.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.863
Where the hell
did you hear that name?

15:46.988 --> 15:48.990
I've run his name
through every database.

15:49.115 --> 15:52.369
I got nothing. The guy's a ghost.
If the agency knows anything...

15:52.494 --> 15:54.579
Here's what I know. Stay out of it.

15:54.704 --> 15:55.914
And if you ask anyone else,

15:56.039 --> 15:58.208
they'll tell you the same,
just less politely.

15:58.333 --> 15:59.876
The man's a mercenary...

16:00.710 --> 16:02.003
and a traitor.

16:02.337 --> 16:03.505
What do you mean?

16:04.714 --> 16:06.132
He's American?

16:06.883 --> 16:09.219
Wait a minute.
That's all you're going to give me?

16:09.344 --> 16:11.388
You don't think I'm helping you, Hannah?

16:11.513 --> 16:12.889
Walk away.

16:13.014 --> 16:15.141
That's the best help anyone can give you.

16:18.895 --> 16:20.939
Now, sir, in the off chance
that the Russians

16:21.064 --> 16:22.941
don't know that Weston
is working for us,

16:23.066 --> 16:25.026
we can't say anything
to Ambassador Petrov

16:25.151 --> 16:26.778
- that might compromise him.
- I understand.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.739
Don't admit anything until they do.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.746
Ambassador Petrov.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.915
I'm President Kirkman.

16:39.749 --> 16:43.169
I wish we were meeting under
better circumstances, Mr. President.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.048
It's a shame to see
a legend like Mr. Weston

16:47.173 --> 16:49.592
rely on such dishonest means to win.

16:50.260 --> 16:53.596
Yes, I know how stringent your country
has been about that sort of thing.

16:53.722 --> 16:56.224
Well, this is a serious
violation of our laws.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.643
Maybe that's why you brought
a representative

16:58.768 --> 17:00.895
from your ministry of defense
to this meeting.

17:01.021 --> 17:03.732
I didn't realize
that personal drug infractions

17:03.857 --> 17:06.151
was a matter
of national security in Russia.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.903
Well, perhaps it's for the same reason
you brought your head of CIA.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.241
Mr. President, it's time
to drop the charade.

17:14.284 --> 17:17.119
We both know Brad Weston
is a U.S. asset.

17:18.788 --> 17:23.084
You and I have a very different
perspective on who Coach Weston is.

17:23.209 --> 17:27.505
Having said that, I do believe
that both our countries

17:27.630 --> 17:31.468
would be served dealing with this
as quietly and quickly as possible.

17:33.470 --> 17:35.096
What do you want?

17:35.221 --> 17:37.515
All American nuclear weapons

17:37.640 --> 17:39.851
removed from Incirlik
Air Base in Turkey.

17:39.976 --> 17:42.479
That will never happen.

17:43.980 --> 17:47.442
Then I'm afraid your asset
will face the Russian courts...

17:48.443 --> 17:52.655
which do not look kindly
on either drugs... or spies.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.536
And with the cooperation
of our nation's governors, as you know,

17:58.661 --> 18:00.705
special congressional elections
have been confirmed for later this week.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.124
Okay, I just have time
for a couple more questions. Yeah.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.835
Where is Majid Nassar?
And why is the White House

18:05.960 --> 18:07.670
- being so secretive about his location?
- Shelly, we've been through this.

18:07.796 --> 18:10.548
Majid Nassar is at an undisclosed
location both for his protection

18:10.673 --> 18:12.175
and for the safety
of those guarding him.

18:12.675 --> 18:15.512
Seth. Any update on Brad Weston?

18:15.637 --> 18:18.181
Yes. The president had a very productive
meeting with the Russian ambassador,

18:18.306 --> 18:21.142
and we're hopeful that the situation
will be resolved soon, okay?

18:21.267 --> 18:23.812
Thanks, everybody.

18:24.687 --> 18:25.939
Thank you.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.483
Lisa, hey.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.735
Well, if it isn't Seth Wright.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.238
You have that comment for me,
or you just miss me already?

18:33.363 --> 18:35.698
- Can I talk to you privately?
- Yeah.

18:36.116 --> 18:40.495
So, I have a very uncomfortable,
likely inappropriate favor to ask you.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.205
Okay.

18:42.330 --> 18:45.583
I need you to hold that story
on Leo for as long as possible.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.252
'Cause it's true?

18:47.377 --> 18:49.170
I'm not saying that.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.381
- Hmm.
- I know it doesn't look like I'm begging,

18:51.506 --> 18:53.299
but this is me begging.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.177
24 hours.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.263
I can't stall my editors
any longer than that.

18:58.388 --> 18:59.722
Thank you.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.229
You are not gonna believe this.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.857
Catalan is an American.

19:09.732 --> 19:10.859
My contact says he's a traitor.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.570
- You've got to be kidding me.
- What?

19:23.830 --> 19:26.416
- Congressman.
- Agent Wells.

19:26.541 --> 19:29.085
- Hello. It's good to see you again.
- And you.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.005
- Deputy Director, may I have a moment?
- Sure.

19:32.547 --> 19:34.507
Agent Wells,
we'll get back to that in a second.

19:35.091 --> 19:36.217
Yes, sir.

19:36.342 --> 19:37.427
Excuse me.

19:37.760 --> 19:38.970
Have a seat.

19:39.095 --> 19:42.265
You know, these unexpected
meetings are becoming a habit.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.434
Yeah. I'm sorry. I know you have your...

19:44.559 --> 19:46.603
hands full with the Nassar investigation.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.564
And on top of that,

19:49.689 --> 19:53.985
I understand the FBI's
been asked to vet me for VP.

19:54.110 --> 19:57.989
So let me save the bureau some resources.

19:58.114 --> 20:01.159
Seven years.
State and federal tax returns.

20:01.284 --> 20:03.828
Military service records
and discharge papers.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.788
Latest medical exams.

20:06.122 --> 20:09.000
A few other things in there
I thought you might be interested in.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.460
And these documents...

20:10.585 --> 20:13.838
Any chance they won't match
what we can find ourselves?

20:13.963 --> 20:18.843
Not unless my wife, lawyer, and internist
are conspiring against me.

20:20.803 --> 20:24.807
You do understand that we will continue
with our own vetting?

20:25.308 --> 20:26.976
I'd expect no less.

20:28.102 --> 20:29.479
You know how it is.

20:30.396 --> 20:35.944
What's on the paper,
that tells a story that we want to tell.

20:36.069 --> 20:39.656
But what's not on the paper...

20:40.907 --> 20:42.784
That's what people remember.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.412
The impressions we leave behind.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.831
Now, we search for those, too...

20:50.458 --> 20:53.419
'cause, you see,
that's the true measure of a man.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.463
Of course.

20:56.631 --> 20:58.800
I think the last thing
that either of us wants

20:58.925 --> 21:00.760
is the wrong person in office.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.347
I promise you.

21:04.472 --> 21:06.849
The bureau ain't gonna let that happen.

21:10.853 --> 21:12.855
Deputy Director...

21:14.023 --> 21:15.191
thank you.

21:16.192 --> 21:17.652
Congressman.

21:29.872 --> 21:30.873
What the hell was that?

21:30.999 --> 21:33.543
What the hell you think it was?
A bunch of B.S.

21:33.668 --> 21:37.255
The guy's gonna walk in here and
voluntarily give us 10 years of papers

21:37.380 --> 21:38.923
that no one asked for?

21:39.048 --> 21:41.175
Now, why would he be
so eager to do that?

21:42.552 --> 21:44.512
Because he's got something to hide.

21:47.890 --> 21:50.685
<i>Early this morning,
upon arrival in Moscow,</i>

21:52.061 --> 21:55.857
<i>customs agents discovered
20 vials of HGH in my suitcase.</i>

21:55.982 --> 21:59.944
<i>I was well-aware
that these were illegal in Russia.</i>

22:00.069 --> 22:04.032
<i>But I was under pressure to make sure
we were performing at the highest level.</i>

22:05.867 --> 22:10.371
<i>I am very sorry for my transgressions
against the Russian government.</i>

22:11.706 --> 22:13.374
Well, the Russians are doubling down.

22:13.499 --> 22:16.377
By coercing a confession
from an American legend.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.379
We've got to stop this.
I just don't know how.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.590
Sir, I think I know a way
to get Brad Weston back.

22:21.090 --> 22:24.302
- Are you a basketball fan?
- What does basketball got to do with this?

22:24.427 --> 22:26.929
Last year, the Washington Wizards
traded for the Thunder's point guard.

22:27.055 --> 22:29.807
But the Wizards didn't have
a player the Thunder wanted,

22:29.932 --> 22:33.978
- so they had to find a third team who did.
- Apparently, men don't own sports.

22:34.103 --> 22:36.981
No, this is good. A three-way trade.
Find out what the Russians want.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.232
Find the country that's got it.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.068
Yes, sir.

22:55.458 --> 22:56.876
Alex Kirkman.

22:58.753 --> 23:00.963
You did well for yourself.

23:01.089 --> 23:03.049
Can't say the same for you.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.134
18 years.

23:06.386 --> 23:08.262
Beautiful as ever.

23:08.388 --> 23:09.931
What do you want, Jeffrey?

23:10.056 --> 23:12.517
- You always had an angle.
- Mm.

23:12.642 --> 23:16.479
Yeah, I made a lot of money
for a lot of people working an angle.

23:17.397 --> 23:18.356
That's funny.

23:18.481 --> 23:21.359
You never could tell the difference
between an insult and a compliment.

23:23.319 --> 23:26.906
But you're not here
to reminisce, are you?

23:27.490 --> 23:29.450
No, I am not.

23:29.575 --> 23:32.370
I am here to tell you
in no uncertain terms

23:32.495 --> 23:34.497
to stay away from my son.

23:35.998 --> 23:37.458
- Your son?
- Yeah.

23:37.583 --> 23:38.501
Mm.

23:39.168 --> 23:40.795
I saw you on TV.

23:43.005 --> 23:47.802
You, the president, your family.

23:49.679 --> 23:53.266
And looking at Leo, his eyes, his chin,

23:54.183 --> 23:56.310
all I could think was, "Wow.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.354
He could be my son."

24:02.358 --> 24:04.193
And looking at you now,

24:04.694 --> 24:06.154
I can tell.

24:06.279 --> 24:08.364
You're not sure either.

24:08.865 --> 24:09.699
Oh, no.

24:09.824 --> 24:11.993
He has a father.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.870
Oh, I know.

24:13.995 --> 24:17.290
A man with the authority
to release me with time served.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.375
Wow.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.211
You really haven't changed at all.

24:23.045 --> 24:24.714
Look at where I am, Alex.

24:26.466 --> 24:29.218
So, either you help me
get out of here,

24:30.219 --> 24:32.388
or I tell the world my story.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.939
Madam Secretary,
I want to thank you for your diligence.

24:42.064 --> 24:43.191
Thank you, Mr. President.

24:43.316 --> 24:46.319
- Excuse me for one second.
- Of course, sir.

24:48.404 --> 24:51.115
We've identified something
the Russians want. From the Saudis.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.075
But we have to act fast, sir.

24:55.661 --> 24:56.954
Good work.

24:57.079 --> 24:58.539
- Set it up.
- Yes, sir.

25:01.876 --> 25:03.961
Took some nerve
for MacLeish to show up here.

25:04.086 --> 25:07.381
Tell me about it. But when you look
at his file, what do you notice?

25:07.507 --> 25:09.800
- That Peter MacLeish is boring.
- Right.

25:09.926 --> 25:13.387
And that's his proof that
he's some exemplary human being.

25:13.763 --> 25:16.307
Well, we know he's mixed up
in this, so there goes that.

25:16.432 --> 25:19.477
Yeah, but the problem is,
Nassar has no idea who he is.

25:19.602 --> 25:22.146
So how do we connect a three-time
congressman from Oregon

25:22.271 --> 25:24.065
with a jihadist from North Africa?

25:26.067 --> 25:28.069
Maybe Catalan is the connection.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.946
Yeah, but we still
don't know who Catalan is.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.159
Hey, hon. What's up?

25:35.284 --> 25:36.994
<i>Luke never got off the bus.</i>

25:37.119 --> 25:39.705
<i>I came to the school.
He's not here either.</i>

25:40.289 --> 25:42.333
All right, well,
did you look everywhere for him?

25:42.458 --> 25:44.794
Check the baseball field?
Or did you call the police?

25:44.919 --> 25:46.587
<i>No, I called you.</i>

25:46.712 --> 25:50.132
Okay, Yvette, hang up the phone
and call the police.

25:50.258 --> 25:52.009
I'm gonna meet you at the school.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.678
What's going on?

25:53.803 --> 25:55.096
My son never made it home.

25:55.805 --> 25:56.973
I got to go.

26:13.114 --> 26:15.199
- Ambassador Petrov?
- Waiting in the Oval.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.368
The Saudi ambassador is
in the Roosevelt Room, sir.

26:17.493 --> 26:18.786
Got it.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.080
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

26:25.001 --> 26:26.711
Mr. Ambassador.

26:26.836 --> 26:30.172
Thank you for making it here
on such short notice. Please.

26:33.134 --> 26:36.846
King Ahmed is always eager
to help his American friends.

26:36.971 --> 26:38.639
Well, then I'll get straight to the point.

26:38.764 --> 26:41.058
I would like to propose a deal.

26:41.183 --> 26:42.560
I would like to propose a deal.

26:42.685 --> 26:43.644
A deal?

26:44.145 --> 26:45.062
A deal?

26:45.187 --> 26:47.398
In exchange for Mr. Weston?

26:47.523 --> 26:50.026
- Yes.
- And what is this?

26:50.151 --> 26:52.069
We are willing to return
four Saudi nationals

26:52.194 --> 26:55.406
who were arrested by the FBI
for committing industrial espionage

26:55.531 --> 26:58.075
- against a Texas oil company.
- Or so you claim.

26:58.200 --> 27:01.245
Nevertheless, would you like
to see them free and flying home tonight?

27:01.370 --> 27:03.748
And what would you like in return?

27:03.873 --> 27:06.417
The Russian agent you picked up
in Riyadh last summer.

27:06.542 --> 27:10.838
An agent? This man was a private citizen
on a business trip.

27:10.963 --> 27:11.922
Not according to the Saudis.

27:12.048 --> 27:14.592
He was a deep-cover operative
for the FSB.

27:14.717 --> 27:16.594
And what would the Saudis like from us?

27:16.719 --> 27:17.887
Absolutely nothing.

27:18.012 --> 27:19.889
And what do the Russians want from us?

27:20.014 --> 27:21.098
Absolutely nothing.

27:21.223 --> 27:22.016
Nothing?

27:22.141 --> 27:23.017
Nothing?

27:23.142 --> 27:25.102
As long as the Russians
get their officer back,

27:25.227 --> 27:26.812
we will return your people to you.

27:29.732 --> 27:31.275
I must say, Mr. President...

27:31.400 --> 27:34.862
This is a very unusual proposal.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.031
These are very unusual times.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.949
So, we get our citizens back.

27:39.075 --> 27:41.035
And we get our comrade home.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.245
And an American hero gets

27:43.371 --> 27:45.206
to return home to a grateful nation.

27:48.751 --> 27:50.419
Mr. Ambassador...

27:50.836 --> 27:52.421
do we have an agreement?

27:53.839 --> 27:57.134
A transnational three-way spy trade.

27:57.259 --> 27:58.552
- Well done, sir.
- Nothing's done yet.

27:58.678 --> 28:01.305
And it's not gonna take much
for it to all fall apart.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.599
So I need you both
to stay on top of it.

28:04.725 --> 28:07.853
- I need to see Alex over at the residence.
- Yes, sir.

28:08.270 --> 28:11.482
He actually makes me reconsider
my position on the death penalty.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.861
What did he want?

28:16.612 --> 28:20.991
He'll back off if you call
the parole board on his behalf.

28:21.117 --> 28:23.035
- Time served, early release.
- Yeah.

28:23.953 --> 28:26.414
If not, he talks to the reporter.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.084
It's blackmail.

28:30.459 --> 28:35.214
An opportunist with a credible threat
is a dangerous thing.

28:37.299 --> 28:39.969
I never thought
I'd be dealing with this again.

28:40.094 --> 28:41.887
Whether or not Leo was mine.

28:42.972 --> 28:44.974
I can't even remember
the last time I thought about it.

28:45.808 --> 28:49.145
I guess I always figured he had to be,
because I loved him so much.

28:49.895 --> 28:53.482
He <i>is</i> yours. Come on, Tom.
He will always be yours.

28:56.610 --> 28:57.903
Pretty soon...

28:58.904 --> 29:01.657
our son and this country
might not feel the same way.

29:06.162 --> 29:07.538
You were right.

29:07.663 --> 29:09.290
About what?

29:11.667 --> 29:13.544
When you got pregnant with Leo,

29:13.669 --> 29:15.713
you were worried
about the timing of everything.

29:15.838 --> 29:19.341
You wanted to know who the father was.
You asked me to get tested.

29:19.467 --> 29:21.844
I said no. We didn't need to.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.515
I even acted noble about it,

29:27.183 --> 29:29.518
like I was protecting Leo somehow.

29:30.186 --> 29:32.813
Truth is, I was protecting myself.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.734
I loved you so much.

29:36.859 --> 29:39.403
I knew what I wanted,
and I was scared to death

29:39.528 --> 29:41.697
of anything that could jeopardize that.

29:42.198 --> 29:43.365
Tom...

29:43.991 --> 29:48.537
Leo has every right to know
who his real father is...

29:49.872 --> 29:51.791
even if it's not me.

29:59.381 --> 30:00.382
Yeah?

30:00.508 --> 30:02.051
Okay.

30:02.551 --> 30:04.470
They need me down in Command Ops.

30:17.066 --> 30:18.275
- Yvette.
- Jason.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.110
- Did you find him?
- They searched the whole school.

30:20.236 --> 30:21.862
- He is not here.
- Okay, calm down.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.448
All right, did you tell them
about the comic-book store?

30:24.573 --> 30:26.867
- Yes, I told them.
- What about the park?

30:26.992 --> 30:29.286
Our son plays Little League
over at the park on Chamberlain.

30:29.411 --> 30:31.789
Deputy Director... you know most
situations like this, the kid turns up

30:31.914 --> 30:34.375
in a few hours, doesn't even know
anyone's been looking for him.

30:35.251 --> 30:37.211
Except this time, it's my son.

30:39.755 --> 30:42.633
You go home. You wait on Luke, okay?
Stay by your phone.

30:42.758 --> 30:44.218
Where are you going?

30:44.343 --> 30:46.011
I'm gonna find our son.

30:49.598 --> 30:52.893
Sir, the spy exchange is imminent.
All three planes are about to land.

30:53.018 --> 30:55.104
- London, Moscow, Riyadh.
- Finally.

30:55.229 --> 30:56.313
Sir?

30:56.438 --> 30:58.440
First good news we've had all day.

30:58.566 --> 30:59.984
Where are we?

31:00.109 --> 31:01.569
Sir, first two planes have arrived.

31:01.694 --> 31:03.821
We've gotten confirmation from our people
in Moscow and Riyadh.

31:03.946 --> 31:04.905
We're waiting on London.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.700
Weston's plane has landed.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.411
The Embassy Deputy
Chief of Mission, DCM.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.454
We'll have a live feed
when he greets Weston.

31:14.290 --> 31:15.958
Those are the Russian pilots.

31:17.877 --> 31:19.879
Weston should be stepping off now.

31:21.255 --> 31:22.673
Ask him again.

31:22.798 --> 31:25.801
- What's going on?
- I want confirmation now.

31:29.638 --> 31:30.806
Mr. President...

31:32.808 --> 31:35.311
it appears Brad Weston
never got on that plane.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.492
- Jason, did you find him?
- No.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.871
Hannah, let me ask you a question.
What if this isn't a coincidence?

31:53.996 --> 31:55.497
What do you mean?

31:55.623 --> 31:58.542
I mean MacLeish shows up at my office,
and then my son goes missing.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.003
- Jason, stop.
<i>- No. Aren't you the one</i>

32:01.128 --> 32:04.381
that told me the night of the attack,
MacLeish's kid was taken, right?

32:04.506 --> 32:07.551
No, I told you that his wife
may have lost her at the mall.

32:07.676 --> 32:08.719
That's not the same thing.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.721
<i>We don't know that this is
what we're dealing with.</i>

32:10.846 --> 32:13.182
Well, how do we know it's not?
I mean, this...

32:13.307 --> 32:15.476
this is all my fault.

32:15.601 --> 32:18.354
Hey, listen to me.
We're in this together.

32:19.313 --> 32:20.481
<i>All right, I'm on it.</i>

32:24.944 --> 32:26.737
How the hell was he not on that plane?

32:26.862 --> 32:28.864
So, what, the Russians
are still holding him?

32:28.989 --> 32:30.407
Sir, I can't answer that yet.

32:30.532 --> 32:32.743
But I can assure you that
we have everyone looking for him.

32:32.868 --> 32:35.746
Transmit it directly. We've got
the right encryption packet in place.

32:35.871 --> 32:39.208
Mr. President, my apologies.
Our agents needed time to confirm.

32:39.333 --> 32:41.669
You need to see this.
Put it up on the screen.

32:44.546 --> 32:45.923
What am I looking at?

32:46.048 --> 32:47.549
The one on the right is Viktor Mishkin.

32:47.675 --> 32:51.261
Our Moscow station identified him
as a Russian FSB captain,

32:51.387 --> 32:53.555
and the top recruiter of foreign assets.

32:53.681 --> 32:54.932
And the man on his left?

32:55.057 --> 32:56.433
That's Brad Weston, sir.

32:56.558 --> 32:59.019
However it happened,
he's still in Russia.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.772
He made contact with their intelligence
a few minutes ago.

33:01.897 --> 33:05.109
We believe the other man is
Weston's contact and handler.

33:05.234 --> 33:06.568
Handler?

33:11.657 --> 33:14.243
We now know
why he didn't get on that plane.

33:14.368 --> 33:15.285
Son of a bitch.

33:15.411 --> 33:18.163
Brad Weston is a double agent.

33:26.922 --> 33:29.550
You know, for a spook,
you're pretty easy to track.

33:29.675 --> 33:33.345
Why are you here? I meant what I said.
I'm not helping you. Stay out of it.

33:34.596 --> 33:35.931
I can't.

33:36.598 --> 33:38.600
I need what you have on Catalan.

33:40.102 --> 33:40.936
Tim...

33:41.937 --> 33:43.188
please.

33:43.772 --> 33:45.190
I'm out of time.

33:45.941 --> 33:48.819
Hannah, I don't want
to see you get hurt.

33:48.944 --> 33:52.656
There are people that I love
that are in trouble.

33:52.781 --> 33:54.658
I don't care what happens to me.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.827
I care what happens to them.

33:56.952 --> 33:58.245
Please.

34:02.249 --> 34:03.959
Let me see what I can do.

34:14.969 --> 34:17.306
Mr. President. Ambassador Petrov.

34:17.431 --> 34:18.724
Thank you, Wyatt.

34:28.150 --> 34:30.319
Mr. Ambassador,
you played me today.

34:30.444 --> 34:34.697
During the 10 years
that Mr. Weston worked with the CIA,

34:34.822 --> 34:37.284
he gained access to case officers.

34:37.409 --> 34:40.245
A clandestine treasure trove, if you will.

34:41.996 --> 34:44.833
Now it's yours. Congratulations.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.835
Russia is a free country, Mr. President.

34:48.670 --> 34:51.757
Perhaps Mr. Weston simply chose
to remain in Moscow.

34:52.674 --> 34:54.885
When you've been at the game
of international chess

34:55.010 --> 34:57.888
for more than a month,
you'll understand these things.

34:58.013 --> 35:02.726
Well, I may have been
in over my head today,

35:02.851 --> 35:05.229
but I promise you,
I'm a quick study.

35:05.354 --> 35:08.649
And the one thing
that I do know about chess

35:08.774 --> 35:12.486
is that there is nothing more dangerous
than a pawn that thinks it's a queen.

35:13.862 --> 35:16.698
Take care, Mr. Ambassador.

35:19.284 --> 35:21.286
Mr. President.

35:29.503 --> 35:30.587
Hey.

35:30.712 --> 35:32.214
Hey.

35:32.339 --> 35:36.051
- Relax. You still have 19 hours left.
- Yeah, I don't think I need them.

35:36.510 --> 35:38.387
Oh. You have that comment for me?

35:38.512 --> 35:40.264
No. I have something else.
An exclusive.

35:40.389 --> 35:42.182
Well, I've already got an exclusive.

35:42.307 --> 35:43.851
Yeah, I'm betting
you're gonna want this one.

35:43.976 --> 35:46.061
- Why is that?
- It's not gossip.

35:48.063 --> 35:50.899
I am not a gossip columnist, Seth.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.944
I'm building a political profile of a man

35:54.069 --> 35:56.113
this country is desperate
to know more about.

35:56.238 --> 35:59.575
Your boss. But it's good to know
that's how you see me.

36:00.534 --> 36:02.369
Lisa, that's not how I see you.

36:02.494 --> 36:05.247
Look, you can publish the piece on Leo.
I just don't think you should.

36:06.915 --> 36:10.377
President Kirkman is a good man.
They're a great family.

36:10.752 --> 36:13.922
He didn't ask for this job, but now he's
got it, and everyone's gunning for him.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.091
And Leo's 17.

36:16.216 --> 36:19.261
I don't think he deserves to have
his life analyzed on the front page.

36:20.929 --> 36:23.265
So, what's the exclusive?

36:23.390 --> 36:25.475
Inside information,
first-person account,

36:25.601 --> 36:28.979
of how the president negotiated for
the release of an American hero,

36:29.104 --> 36:31.106
only to discover
he's not who he seems.

36:32.107 --> 36:33.775
What do you have on Weston?

36:34.568 --> 36:36.236
Let's make a deal, and I'll tell you.

36:38.405 --> 36:40.073
- Thank you, Wyatt.
- Of course, sir.

36:41.116 --> 36:43.118
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.455
It's late. Don't you two ever go home?

36:46.580 --> 36:48.248
We'll go home
when the next president takes office.

36:49.374 --> 36:51.835
Want to get a head start
on tomorrow's work?

36:51.960 --> 36:53.837
Since you haven't been sleeping much
anyway.

36:53.962 --> 36:55.505
Show me what you got.

36:55.631 --> 36:57.633
After your morning security briefing,
you'll be meeting

36:57.758 --> 36:59.843
the director
of the National Economic Council.

36:59.968 --> 37:01.970
And? What else?

37:02.763 --> 37:03.847
MacLeish, sir.

37:03.972 --> 37:06.183
- What about him?
- We've been thinking,

37:06.308 --> 37:08.727
since you two hit it off so well,
maybe we should make it official.

37:09.394 --> 37:12.522
The press is already speculating
he might be your vice president.

37:12.648 --> 37:14.858
And with the congressional
elections coming up next week...

37:14.983 --> 37:17.194
The country could use
some good news. Don't you think?

37:17.319 --> 37:20.489
I've decided to wait to hear
what the FBI has to say.

37:20.989 --> 37:22.699
If today's taught me anything,

37:22.824 --> 37:24.576
it's that you can't know
enough about a person.

37:25.619 --> 37:28.038
Aaron, any news yet
from Deputy Director Atwood

37:28.163 --> 37:30.040
on who might have killed Nassar?

37:30.165 --> 37:32.542
No, sir. I've been trying
to get ahold of him all afternoon.

37:32.668 --> 37:35.379
His secretary said he's been
out of the office on personal business.

37:35.504 --> 37:36.421
Personal business?

37:37.172 --> 37:39.216
During a murder investigation?

37:39.341 --> 37:42.177
- I'll keep on top of him, sir.
- Good. The last thing we need

37:42.302 --> 37:45.222
is the world to find out Nassar
is dead and we don't know who did it.

37:45.347 --> 37:46.431
Presidential order.

37:47.015 --> 37:49.726
Both of you, go home, get some sleep.
Thanks for everything.

37:49.851 --> 37:50.978
Thank you, sir.

37:51.353 --> 37:53.814
Yeah?

37:56.650 --> 37:57.693
What's up?

37:58.443 --> 38:00.320
Ju-- Just wanted
to say good night.

38:00.654 --> 38:01.822
Okay.

38:09.705 --> 38:10.706
What?

38:12.040 --> 38:13.792
Why are you looking at me like that?

38:17.045 --> 38:18.171
I don't know. It...

38:24.469 --> 38:27.389
A lot's happened
in this last six weeks.

38:27.889 --> 38:30.559
I feel like I haven't seen you
or talked to you.

38:31.685 --> 38:33.228
Is everything all right?

38:33.353 --> 38:34.813
Yeah. I...

38:37.482 --> 38:39.401
I just wanted to tell you
that I love you.

38:41.236 --> 38:42.612
Yeah.

38:42.738 --> 38:44.072
I love you, too.

38:46.742 --> 38:48.994
- Good night.
- Good night.

40:07.656 --> 40:08.490
Chow time.

40:08.615 --> 40:10.909
Guess your guy will have to wait.

40:30.011 --> 40:31.179
Coach!

40:32.514 --> 40:34.015
Have you seen my son?

40:34.141 --> 40:38.562
Come on. Jason, it's Hannah.
Call me back. I know who killed Nassar.

40:38.687 --> 40:40.021
Luke?!

40:44.192 --> 40:47.070
Mr. Atwood. I noticed your son
didn't show up for practice.

40:47.195 --> 40:49.656
- Have you seen him?
- I can assure you, Luke is fine.

40:51.700 --> 40:54.369
In fact, he's the only kid I know
who likes coffee ice cream.

40:54.494 --> 40:55.996
Where's my son?

40:56.121 --> 40:57.164
Where is my son?

40:57.289 --> 40:59.040
Deep breath, Jason.

40:59.499 --> 41:01.168
Think it through.
Anything happens to me,

41:01.293 --> 41:04.838
and the next photo you'll see
is Luke with a bullet in his brain.

41:05.380 --> 41:07.215
I know you love your family,

41:07.632 --> 41:09.718
and it would be a tragedy
if something happened to Luke...

41:09.843 --> 41:11.845
or to Yvette...

41:12.345 --> 41:15.015
sometime after you've buried your son.

41:15.140 --> 41:19.102
You hurt my family, I promise you...

41:19.227 --> 41:20.395
I will kill you

41:21.062 --> 41:22.522
and whoever the hell
you're working with.

41:22.647 --> 41:25.692
Your son will be safe as long as you do
everything I tell you to do,

41:25.817 --> 41:27.110
starting with the obvious.

41:27.235 --> 41:30.530
Tell anyone about
this encounter and Luke dies.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.032
What do you want?

41:35.410 --> 41:37.579
You're going to make an appointment
with the president.

41:39.664 --> 41:42.292
And when you're face-to-face
with Kirkman,

41:42.417 --> 41:44.586
you will do exactly as I instruct.

41:47.088 --> 41:48.548
I'll be in touch.
