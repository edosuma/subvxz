02:11.423 --> 02:14.218
<i>When your father
was a boy like you</i>

02:14.468 --> 02:16.387
<i>and living with me
here in Norway,</i>

02:16.595 --> 02:18.973
<i>I told him
about witches, too,</i>

02:19.557 --> 02:21.892
<i>so that he would
always be aware.</i>

02:22.601 --> 02:24.979
<i>Now, the most
important thing</i>

02:25.146 --> 02:28.107
<i>you should know about
real witches is this...</i>

02:28.440 --> 02:30.234
<i>now listen
very carefully...</i>

02:30.818 --> 02:34.321
<i>real witches dress
in ordinary clothes</i>

02:34.488 --> 02:36.740
<i>and look very much
like ordinary women.</i>

02:37.116 --> 02:38.951
<i>They live
in ordinary houses,</i>

02:39.118 --> 02:42.788
and they work
in ordinary jobs.

02:46.125 --> 02:49.211
Every country
in the world has witches.

02:49.879 --> 02:52.214
And there is a leader,

02:52.882 --> 02:54.175
a high witch

02:54.341 --> 02:55.593
of each country.

02:56.010 --> 02:59.680
And the ruler
of all the witches

03:00.139 --> 03:03.893
<i>is The Most Evil Woman
in creation...</i>

03:04.226 --> 03:07.062
<i>The Grand High Witch...</i>

03:07.521 --> 03:09.064
Herself.

03:13.611 --> 03:15.821
Witches spend their time

03:15.988 --> 03:17.531
plotting to kill children,

03:18.365 --> 03:19.783
<i>stalking
the wretched child</i>

03:19.950 --> 03:23.287
<i>like a hunter stalks
a bird in the forest.</i>

03:23.871 --> 03:24.955
Did they hunt you?

03:31.545 --> 03:32.963
You said
it was an accident.

03:33.339 --> 03:36.425
A very unpleasant
accident.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.386
<i>You know,
when I was younger,</i>

03:40.137 --> 03:43.224
<i>I traveled the world in search
for the grand high witch,</i>

03:43.390 --> 03:44.892
<i>but I never found her.</i>

03:45.351 --> 03:46.852
I don't really believe

03:47.019 --> 03:49.230
that anyone
has ever found her.

03:49.647 --> 03:51.982
So if no one's seen
the grand high witch,

03:52.149 --> 03:54.151
how are you sure
she exists?

03:54.318 --> 03:55.861
Nobody's ever seen
the devil,

03:56.070 --> 03:57.863
but we know he exists,
don't we?

03:58.030 --> 03:58.988
Yeah.

03:58.989 --> 03:59.989
<i>For all you know,</i>

04:00.032 --> 04:02.534
<i>a witch might be living
next-door to you.</i>

04:04.203 --> 04:06.038
<i>When I was little,</i>

04:06.205 --> 04:08.832
<i>I lived beside a girl
called Erica,</i>

04:08.999 --> 04:11.126
<i>who was taken
by a witch.</i>

04:11.794 --> 04:14.672
<i>Erica had very
strict parents.</i>

04:15.506 --> 04:18.007
<i>But even that
didn't save poor Erica,</i>

04:18.259 --> 04:20.970
<i>because when a witch
chooses a victim,</i>

04:21.136 --> 04:23.889
<i>there is only
one hope of escape...</i>

04:24.139 --> 04:26.392
<i>knowing everything
about them</i>

04:26.558 --> 04:28.185
<i>that I am telling you.</i>

04:28.394 --> 04:29.937
<i>I'm warning you.</i>

04:30.896 --> 04:32.940
Erica. Come in.

04:33.399 --> 04:34.584
<i>What makes her
dangerous</i>

04:34.608 --> 04:37.236
<i>is the fact that she
doesn't look dangerous.</i>

04:37.569 --> 04:39.113
<i>You can never be sure</i>

04:39.280 --> 04:41.031
<i>if it's a witch
you are looking at</i>

04:41.198 --> 04:42.574
<i>or a kind lady.</i>

04:46.578 --> 04:47.997
Ah, Erica.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.000
How do you like
my new painting?

04:51.166 --> 04:52.793
It's <i>magnifique,</i>
papa.

04:53.836 --> 04:55.129
Go to Larsen's

04:56.005 --> 04:57.005
and buy...

04:57.214 --> 04:58.799
A liter of milk.
Hmm?

04:59.049 --> 05:00.134
<i>Ja,</i> papa.

05:03.595 --> 05:04.847
Come straight home.

05:05.097 --> 05:06.140
Ja, da.

05:06.515 --> 05:09.476
<i>Real witches
hate children.</i>

05:13.897 --> 05:17.359
Real witches
are quite bald,

05:17.693 --> 05:19.320
although, of course,
they wear wigs...

05:19.903 --> 05:21.280
<i>That itch...</i>

05:21.739 --> 05:23.991
<i>And cause them
scalp rash.</i>

05:24.158 --> 05:26.160
<i>Do you know
what scalp rash is?</i>

05:26.327 --> 05:27.327
No.

05:27.578 --> 05:29.413
Itching under the wig.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.707
It must drive them crazy.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.793
They look quite hideous

05:35.169 --> 05:37.755
<i>behind their human
face masks</i>

05:37.921 --> 05:41.258
<i>and can only be distinguished
from ordinary women</i>

05:41.675 --> 05:43.260
<i>if you are sharp enough</i>

05:43.427 --> 05:46.930
<i>to spot the purple tinge
to their eyes.</i>

05:47.973 --> 05:51.560
<i>Real witches
have no toes.</i>

05:52.061 --> 05:54.438
<i>Their feet
have square ends,</i>

05:54.605 --> 05:57.941
<i>revolting stumps where
their toes should be,</i>

05:58.525 --> 06:01.820
<i>so they never wear
pointed or pretty shoes...</i>

06:01.987 --> 06:05.032
<i>just plain,
sensible shoes.</i>

06:05.949 --> 06:08.619
<i>Remember these things.</i>

06:10.037 --> 06:12.873
<i>Perhaps if Erica
had known them...</i>

06:27.554 --> 06:29.765
<i>Oh,
my poor Erica.</i>

06:30.182 --> 06:32.518
<i>For weeks
they searched,</i>

06:32.893 --> 06:35.104
<i>but witches
don't murder children</i>

06:35.270 --> 06:36.897
<i>with knives or guns.</i>

06:37.272 --> 06:39.441
<i>That's for people
who get caught,</i>

06:39.650 --> 06:42.694
<i>and witches
never get caught.</i>

06:43.946 --> 06:46.240
<i>They searched
for miles around.</i>

06:46.782 --> 06:48.951
<i>Everyone in the town
searched,</i>

06:49.159 --> 06:53.122
<i>but she had completely
disappeared.</i>

07:00.170 --> 07:03.549
<i>I was there in Erica's house
six weeks later.</i>

07:03.715 --> 07:05.509
Good day,
frau Larsen.

07:05.676 --> 07:07.928
Come in, Helga.
Have some cake.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.722
<i>I was her best friend
when it all happened.</i>

07:11.932 --> 07:13.684
<i>Then that day,</i>

07:14.143 --> 07:17.187
<i>while Erica's mother
was pouring the coffee,</i>

07:17.604 --> 07:20.357
<i>her father came
walking towards us.</i>

07:20.941 --> 07:24.319
<i>It was as if though
he had seen a ghost.</i>

07:24.611 --> 07:26.280
<i>His face
was all twisted up</i>

07:26.447 --> 07:29.158
<i>as he walked towards
the painting behind me.</i>

07:29.867 --> 07:33.912
<i>There, as if it
always had been there,</i>

07:34.621 --> 07:35.956
<i>was Erica,</i>

07:36.373 --> 07:38.417
<i>locked in the painting,</i>

07:38.584 --> 07:40.836
<i>gazing at us.</i>

07:41.712 --> 07:43.338
<i>Papa.</i>

07:43.714 --> 07:45.215
<i>Papa.</i>

07:45.883 --> 07:46.799
I don't believe it.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.094
You saw her in
the painting, grandma?

07:49.261 --> 07:50.554
Many times.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.764
But the peculiar thing

07:52.931 --> 07:56.560
was that little Erica kept on
changing her position

07:56.768 --> 07:57.978
<i>in the picture.</i>

07:58.270 --> 08:00.314
<i>So one day she'd be
feeding the ducks,</i>

08:00.481 --> 08:02.858
and the next day she'd be
inside the farmhouse,

08:03.233 --> 08:04.776
looking out of a window.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.362
Did you see her
moving in the picture?

08:07.571 --> 08:09.406
<i>Nobody did.</i>

08:09.907 --> 08:12.576
She was always
just a figure,

08:13.076 --> 08:15.662
<i>motionless
in the painting.</i>

08:16.747 --> 08:18.332
<i>As the years went by,</i>

08:18.540 --> 08:20.667
<i>Erica grew older,
too.</i>

08:22.419 --> 08:25.088
And only
five or six years ago,

08:25.255 --> 08:27.841
the old woman
that Erica had become,

08:28.008 --> 08:30.802
bent and frail
in the painting,

08:31.220 --> 08:34.264
began to disappear...

08:35.015 --> 08:38.018
<i>Until one morning,</i>

08:38.184 --> 08:39.602
<i>she was gone.</i>

08:40.354 --> 08:41.563
You mean she died?

08:41.897 --> 08:43.023
Who knows?

08:43.440 --> 08:46.777
Mysterious things go on
in the world of witches.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.822
Hey,
it's almost 9:00.

08:50.989 --> 08:53.158
Grandma's been tellin'
me about witches, mom.

08:53.325 --> 08:56.620
And frightening you before
you're supposed to go to sleep.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.497
<i>Good night,
darling.</i>

08:58.914 --> 09:00.034
Everything all right,
mother?

09:00.165 --> 09:01.333
<i>Very all right.</i>

09:01.500 --> 09:03.085
<i>Go off. Enjoy
yourselves.</i>

09:03.252 --> 09:04.336
Good-bye,
mom.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.379
Here you go.

09:07.839 --> 09:08.756
Good night, son.

09:08.757 --> 09:09.758
Good night, dad.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.385
No more stories, ok?

09:12.761 --> 09:13.845
Oh, no.

09:40.163 --> 09:43.000
Come on, grandma.
Just one more story?

09:43.166 --> 09:44.543
All right, then.
One more.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.461
But very short.

09:48.422 --> 09:49.798
Witches...

09:50.007 --> 09:51.925
Are very cruel.

09:52.342 --> 09:56.847
And they have a highly-developed
sense of smell.

09:57.222 --> 10:00.017
A real witch could smell you
across the street

10:00.225 --> 10:01.768
on a pitch-black night.

10:02.019 --> 10:04.438
She couldn't smell me.
I just had a shower.

10:04.605 --> 10:05.772
Oh, yes, she could.

10:06.148 --> 10:07.148
The cleaner you are,

10:07.190 --> 10:08.775
the more a witch
can smell you.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.527
That doesn't make sense.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.112
Oh, yes, it does.

10:12.529 --> 10:15.574
A dirty child,
it's the dirt she smells.

10:15.741 --> 10:18.035
A clean child,
it is the child.

10:19.536 --> 10:20.536
Wow.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.040
I'll never have
a shower again,

10:23.206 --> 10:25.667
and I'll have you
for an excuse.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.586
Well, just not too often.

10:27.753 --> 10:30.464
Only once a month
is probably safe.

10:30.756 --> 10:33.008
So a witch could
smell me right now?

10:33.508 --> 10:36.386
To me, you smell
of raspberries and cream,

10:36.928 --> 10:37.929
but to a witch,

10:38.096 --> 10:40.932
you would smell
absolutely disgusting.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.560
What kind
of disgusting?

10:43.935 --> 10:46.188
Like dogs' droppings.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.607
I don't believe it.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.400
You don't believe it?

10:50.901 --> 10:52.110
What's more, to a witch,

10:52.277 --> 10:55.238
you would smell
of fresh dogs' droppings.

10:55.405 --> 10:56.448
That's not true.

10:56.740 --> 10:57.949
There's no point
in arguing.

10:58.116 --> 10:59.493
It's a fact of life.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.620
So if you ever see
a woman in the street

11:01.787 --> 11:04.081
holding her nose
as she passes you,

11:04.373 --> 11:06.124
she could easily
be a witch.

11:07.084 --> 11:09.878
And now it is
definitely bedtime.

11:11.963 --> 11:13.340
Good night, grandma.

11:16.426 --> 11:17.426
Mmm...

11:17.427 --> 11:19.054
Mmm!

11:49.251 --> 11:50.252
<i>Mom?</i>

11:51.962 --> 11:52.962
Dad?

12:27.789 --> 12:30.125
Frau eveshim, could I
come in for a minute?

12:30.876 --> 12:32.627
<i>I'm afraid
I have some bad news.</i>

12:33.295 --> 12:34.421
<i>Ja,</i> come in.

12:35.338 --> 12:36.339
Wait here.

12:55.942 --> 12:56.942
Come on.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.029
<i>Come here to me.</i>

13:00.197 --> 13:01.197
Come on.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.241
Let's cuddle up
here.

13:03.742 --> 13:05.368
Sit on my lap,
all right?

13:05.869 --> 13:06.869
There.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.266
Shall we bring them
to england?

13:28.433 --> 13:29.266
Yeah.

13:29.267 --> 13:30.727
<i>Ja,</i> we'll do that.

13:30.894 --> 13:32.395
I think
they're very good.

13:32.938 --> 13:34.064
I really do.

13:35.065 --> 13:36.065
Quite a talent there

13:36.191 --> 13:38.693
which I didn't know
anything about.

13:41.863 --> 13:42.863
Thanks.

13:54.876 --> 13:57.003
<i>After the accident,</i>

13:57.170 --> 14:01.299
<i>I didn't take Luke
back to America right away.</i>

14:01.550 --> 14:03.802
<i>We went to england,
where I had a house,</i>

14:03.969 --> 14:05.262
<i>and he started
at the school</i>

14:05.428 --> 14:08.139
<i>his mother and father had
chosen for him before they...</i>

14:08.348 --> 14:09.306
Bald?

14:09.307 --> 14:10.559
That's why
they wear wigs.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.769
<i>...Before they came
to me on their vacation.</i>

14:12.936 --> 14:14.104
They itch
and scratch a lot.

14:14.271 --> 14:16.690
I saw a woman yesterday
with purple eyes.

14:28.952 --> 14:29.952
Mmm.

14:34.624 --> 14:35.624
Hello, young man.

14:36.918 --> 14:39.254
What a magnificent
tree house.

14:39.838 --> 14:41.298
Did you build it
yourself?

14:41.756 --> 14:43.174
My dad and I did.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.554
I've got something
for you here...

14:48.847 --> 14:51.141
Something I think
you'll like.

14:51.308 --> 14:52.428
<i>Jump down,</i>

14:52.475 --> 14:53.392
and I'll show you.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.393
- No!
- What?

14:54.603 --> 14:55.937
No, thank you
very much.

14:56.104 --> 14:58.398
It's worth
a lot of money.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.525
This is
private property.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.110
There's nothing
to be frightened of.

15:02.277 --> 15:04.321
I just wanted
to give you this.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.782
I found him
on my walk.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.451
He's quite harmless.

15:11.328 --> 15:12.328
See?

15:13.413 --> 15:15.665
Little boys
love snakes.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.210
Here, he's yours.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.838
- Grandma! Grandma!
- Look, look, look, look, look!

15:22.005 --> 15:23.190
I'll leave him here
if you like.

15:23.214 --> 15:24.525
<i>Then you can come
down on your own</i>

15:24.549 --> 15:25.884
<i>and get him. Hmm?</i>

15:26.468 --> 15:28.678
<i>But they wriggle away
quite quickly,</i>

15:29.721 --> 15:32.557
unless you tell them
not to.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.314
Grandma!

15:41.358 --> 15:43.693
Perhaps you'd like
some chocolate instead?

15:44.361 --> 15:46.696
Grandma!

15:47.155 --> 15:50.158
She can't hear you.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.827
<i>What's your name?</i>

15:53.119 --> 15:54.120
Is it...

15:55.830 --> 15:57.207
Luke?

15:57.749 --> 15:58.875
<i>Thought so.</i>

15:59.292 --> 16:01.336
<i>Here you are...
Luke.</i>

16:01.836 --> 16:05.799
A big bar
of chocolate.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.385
- If you c...
<i>- Luke.</i>

16:09.302 --> 16:10.971
Luke, it's dinnertime.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.020
<i>Luke!</i>

16:19.688 --> 16:21.940
Luke, dinnertime.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.115
Grandma,
did you see her?

16:30.740 --> 16:31.740
<i>Yes.</i>

16:31.950 --> 16:33.159
I think she was a witch.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.661
Gloves, purple eyes.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.663
She wanted me to climb
down from the tree, and

16:36.830 --> 16:38.873
she hypnotized a snake
she wanted to give me.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.375
A real one?

16:40.542 --> 16:42.085
A real snake, yes!

16:46.172 --> 16:47.298
I swear.

16:48.216 --> 16:51.177
Yes, Luke.
I believe you.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.276
Close your eyes.
No cheating.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.737
To your chair.
There we are.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.321
♪♪ Happy birthday
to you ♪♪

17:11.489 --> 17:13.616
♪♪ Happy birthday
to you ♪♪

17:14.159 --> 17:16.828
♪♪ Happy birthday,
dear Luke ♪♪

17:17.037 --> 17:18.747
♪♪ Happy birthday
to you ♪♪

17:18.997 --> 17:19.997
There.

17:20.165 --> 17:22.208
Oh, grandma!
They're great!

17:22.791 --> 17:24.461
I'm gonna build them
a whole circus,

17:24.627 --> 17:25.627
teach them tricks

17:25.795 --> 17:27.380
<i>and acrobatics
and stuff.</i>

17:27.714 --> 17:30.008
<i>It must be so neat
being a mouse.</i>

17:30.216 --> 17:31.593
Just play all day

17:31.760 --> 17:33.720
and eat, and then
play some more.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.264
<i>I'm gonna rig up
a whole room</i>

17:36.431 --> 17:38.224
<i>with ramps and...</i>

17:38.641 --> 17:39.641
<i>grandma!</i>

17:41.644 --> 17:42.644
Grandma!

17:44.022 --> 17:45.106
Grandma!

17:45.940 --> 17:49.110
Your granny has a very
mild case of diabetes.

17:49.277 --> 17:50.653
It's nothing
to worry about.

17:51.112 --> 17:52.112
Have a good rest,
now,

17:52.238 --> 17:54.158
and in a couple of days,
you'll be right as rain.

17:54.532 --> 17:55.658
You're gonna
be better.

17:56.076 --> 17:56.909
Good.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.350
I'm putting you
on a sugar-free diet.

17:58.495 --> 18:01.664
No cakes, candies,
or sugar at all.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.542
Those cigars won't
do you any good.

18:04.709 --> 18:05.542
See?

18:05.543 --> 18:07.462
<i>And there are
some more pills to take.</i>

18:07.629 --> 18:09.964
With that and a good
holiday by the seaside,

18:10.215 --> 18:11.674
you'll be good as new.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.425
Come on, young man.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.303
<i>Leave your granny
to get some rest.</i>

18:15.595 --> 18:18.932
Perhaps you can bring her
breakfast in bed in the morning.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.643
By tomorrow afternoon,
you can boss her around

18:21.810 --> 18:22.810
<i>like before.</i>

18:22.977 --> 18:24.020
<i>Bye-bye,
Mrs. Eveshim.</i>

18:24.187 --> 18:25.062
Bye-bye.

18:25.063 --> 18:26.523
See you
in a couple of days.

18:26.689 --> 18:27.732
<i>Good-bye, doctor.</i>

18:27.899 --> 18:29.419
<i>- Can you find your way?
- Yes.</i>

18:29.526 --> 18:31.069
How come doctors
speak to everybody

18:31.236 --> 18:32.570
like they're babies?

18:32.737 --> 18:34.155
I know.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.617
I'm sorry for spoiling
your birthday for you

18:37.784 --> 18:39.619
and for giving you
a fright.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.453
Is it all right

18:41.454 --> 18:43.373
if I play with
William and Mary now?

18:43.748 --> 18:45.458
Yes, of course.

19:03.726 --> 19:04.726
Listen, Mary mouse,

19:04.853 --> 19:06.688
when grandma gets better,
we're goin' with her

19:06.855 --> 19:08.314
to a hotel by the ocean.

19:08.857 --> 19:10.441
<i>You've never been
to the ocean.</i>

19:10.608 --> 19:11.943
<i>I'll tell you, it's big.</i>

19:22.620 --> 19:24.956
Wow! Look
at the hotel, grandma.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.791
It's not half bad.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.389
- Welcome, madam.
- Thank you very much.

19:41.556 --> 19:43.141
I think it'll be
a nice day, yes?

19:43.850 --> 19:44.851
Can you manage,
Luke?

19:45.018 --> 19:46.394
- Yeah.
- Yes.

20:04.329 --> 20:05.329
Luke...

20:05.538 --> 20:07.123
Come on, dear.
There we go.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.922
Oh, welcome,
miss Ernst.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.255
Nicola Cole.

20:15.256 --> 20:16.089
I've been so
looking forward

20:16.090 --> 20:16.965
to meeting you.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.051
You look
marvelous.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.261
Wish I could say the
same for you.

20:21.638 --> 20:22.680
Ah, miss Ernst.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.974
I am the owner
of the hotel.

20:26.017 --> 20:27.352
We're very happy
to have you.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.520
Yes. Delighted.
Shall I sign or something?

20:29.687 --> 20:30.767
Oh, no, no, no.
No. I'm sure

20:30.813 --> 20:32.208
- everything will be fine.
- This is my secretary.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.692
Oh, yes.
How are you?

20:34.984 --> 20:36.110
Ah, ladies.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.404
Ina Clay
Beckman.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.406
- Indeed.
- Julia Whitman.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.951
Julia, yes.
Where are you from?

20:43.618 --> 20:44.744
- Dallinger.
- Ah, yes.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.663
Lois leffour
from southampton.

20:46.829 --> 20:47.829
Lois.

20:48.706 --> 20:50.250
Ohh! Ohh!

21:00.260 --> 21:01.260
In there, I think.

21:01.344 --> 21:02.512
That's where
you must live.

21:04.305 --> 21:07.308
Oh, um, the carpetbag
on the bed, please.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.310
I'll have
a wash and brush-up

21:09.477 --> 21:11.604
while you explore
the place, Luke.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.982
And then we shall
have tea together,

21:14.482 --> 21:16.818
and you'll show me
around, yes?

21:16.985 --> 21:17.943
Thank you.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.320
Don't
lock me out.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.489
I promise I won't.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.960
You look wonderful,
miss Ernst.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.671
Oh, we are looking forward
to this afternoon!

21:36.838 --> 21:37.964
Hmm.

21:40.174 --> 21:41.342
<i>Irvine?</i>

22:16.336 --> 22:18.046
What are you doin'?

22:18.588 --> 22:19.756
The raisins
are all around

22:19.922 --> 22:21.341
the edge of these cakes.

22:21.507 --> 22:22.967
They're really good!

22:23.259 --> 22:24.259
Thanks.

22:26.346 --> 22:27.638
My name's Luke.

22:29.515 --> 22:30.850
Bruno Jenkins.

22:31.559 --> 22:34.228
The cucumber sandwiches
are all right, too...

22:34.395 --> 22:36.898
except when they use
margarine instead of butter.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.567
How much pocket money
do you get?

22:39.901 --> 22:42.904
<i>My dad's rich,
but he's very tight.</i>

22:43.196 --> 22:44.614
We've got three cars.

22:44.781 --> 22:45.990
Hello, boys.

22:46.157 --> 22:48.576
I hope there's butter
in the sandwiches today.

22:48.743 --> 22:51.537
I really do
hate margarine.

22:51.829 --> 22:54.582
Ah, you've got those
excellent cakes again.

22:54.749 --> 22:55.917
There should be
14 of...

22:58.378 --> 23:00.213
Mr. Stringer!
Oh! Oh!

23:00.463 --> 23:02.632
Shh, shh.
What happened?

23:02.799 --> 23:04.509
I went in
to turn down the bed,

23:04.675 --> 23:05.676
and they were there.

23:05.843 --> 23:06.676
What?

23:06.677 --> 23:08.721
White and disgusting
little...

23:08.888 --> 23:10.890
now, look. Calm down.

23:24.612 --> 23:26.656
Is this your room?

23:26.989 --> 23:28.741
- Yes.
- Yes?

23:29.909 --> 23:31.077
I see.
I'm sorry, madam,

23:31.244 --> 23:33.496
but I cannot permit
mice in my hotel.

23:33.663 --> 23:34.663
How dare you
say that

23:34.789 --> 23:37.333
when your rotten hotel
is full of rats anyway?

23:37.875 --> 23:41.379
Rats? There are no
rats in this hotel.

23:41.546 --> 23:42.588
I saw one
this morning

23:42.755 --> 23:45.216
running along the corridor
into the kitchens.

23:45.716 --> 23:48.344
Madam, you only
arrived in the hotel

23:48.511 --> 23:49.554
this afternoon.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.431
Morning, afternoon.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.891
I saw a rat
in your hotel,

23:54.058 --> 23:56.102
and if matters
do not improve,

23:56.436 --> 23:57.687
I'll shall have to
report you

23:57.854 --> 23:59.981
to the public
health authorities.

24:02.024 --> 24:02.858
Look...

24:02.859 --> 24:04.235
Madam,
I'm not prepared...

24:04.402 --> 24:05.318
the cakes
in the lounge

24:05.319 --> 24:06.799
are nibbled all
around the edges, too.

24:06.946 --> 24:07.946
<i>I can show you.</i>

24:07.989 --> 24:10.074
<i>If you are not
careful, the health people</i>

24:10.241 --> 24:13.536
will order the whole hotel
closed before everyone gets

24:13.703 --> 24:14.912
typhoid fever.

24:15.079 --> 24:16.914
You can't be
serious, madam.

24:17.081 --> 24:19.417
I have never been
more serious in my life.

24:19.584 --> 24:23.588
Now, will you or will you
not let my grandchild

24:23.754 --> 24:27.592
keep his hygienic and
perfectly harmless pet mice?

24:32.180 --> 24:34.348
Uh... well...

24:34.849 --> 24:36.309
Well, if they are
kept in the cage

24:36.517 --> 24:37.768
<i>and only
in this room,</i>

24:37.935 --> 24:39.353
<i>nowhere else
in the hotel...</i>

24:39.520 --> 24:40.520
Agreed.

24:41.564 --> 24:42.565
Very well.

24:51.616 --> 24:54.160
Grandma, I can't
train my mice

24:54.327 --> 24:55.453
if they're
in a cage.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.747
Nibbled cakes, indeed.

24:58.164 --> 25:01.584
There were, only it was
a boy called Bruno Jenkins.

25:01.918 --> 25:03.669
I'm teaching
William and Mary

25:03.878 --> 25:05.171
how to be
tightrope walkers.

25:05.338 --> 25:06.338
Mm-hmm!

25:06.339 --> 25:08.758
I brought some of the circus
I'm building with me.

25:08.925 --> 25:10.426
Good. Show me.

25:13.971 --> 25:15.139
Let's see.

25:15.306 --> 25:17.433
Look. I'm planning
them a major house.

25:17.725 --> 25:20.102
Rampways here.
A bathtub.

25:20.269 --> 25:21.604
<i>This elevator's
pretty neat.</i>

25:21.771 --> 25:23.940
You really did this
yourself? It's good.

25:24.106 --> 25:26.150
It's really good.
I'm impressed.

25:26.317 --> 25:27.902
Of course you must
train your mice,

25:28.069 --> 25:29.320
but you must not
get caught,

25:29.487 --> 25:30.687
and you must not
do it in here,

25:30.905 --> 25:33.699
'cause if that hysterical
maid comes back...

25:34.617 --> 25:36.869
Well, now it's teatime.

25:37.161 --> 25:40.665
I just love
English hotel teas.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.959
Cream cakes
and shortbread

25:43.125 --> 25:44.752
<i>- and, uh...</i>
- no, grandma.

25:44.919 --> 25:46.546
- No cream cakes.
- No cream cakes.

25:46.712 --> 25:47.838
And no shortbread,
either.

25:48.005 --> 25:50.049
It's full of sugar.
I shall end up eating

25:50.216 --> 25:51.842
the same diet
as your mice.

25:52.593 --> 25:54.033
That's the trouble
with this country.

25:54.095 --> 25:55.388
A queue for everything.

25:55.763 --> 25:57.848
Never crossed their mind
to have two tea trolleys.

25:58.015 --> 26:00.518
That'd be too convenient
for the paying guests, eh?

26:01.060 --> 26:02.180
They'll want
two lumps of ice

26:02.228 --> 26:04.188
in their whiskey next.

26:04.355 --> 26:06.566
<i>They'd queue for their own
funerals if they could.</i>

26:07.817 --> 26:10.278
I know that woman
from somewhere,

26:11.028 --> 26:13.531
<i>but I can't for the life
of me remember where.</i>

26:15.783 --> 26:17.994
<i>Her face
is so familiar.</i>

26:19.537 --> 26:20.538
Which one?

26:21.038 --> 26:22.206
My memory's going.

26:22.790 --> 26:25.293
But it's as if
I met her before.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.795
She's probably
on TV or something.

26:27.962 --> 26:30.631
Mmm. Cucumber
sandwiches.

26:30.881 --> 26:31.924
Mmm...

26:33.342 --> 26:35.261
fish paste.

26:35.428 --> 26:36.971
<i>Grandma,
you got the wrong one.</i>

26:38.431 --> 26:40.308
Oh, no. Sugar.

26:40.850 --> 26:42.768
Grandma,
sugar can kill you.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.312
I know, but
it was very little,

26:44.478 --> 26:45.730
<i>very little,
my dear.</i>

26:46.772 --> 26:49.609
Something very odd
is going on.

26:49.775 --> 26:52.278
<i>Are you listening to
me? You'll have some fresh air</i>

26:52.445 --> 26:54.196
if I have to take you
out by your ear.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.508
We didn't come here
for you to sit eating

26:56.532 --> 26:57.950
and watching telly
all day.

26:58.659 --> 26:59.678
Look at
the lovely sunshine.

26:59.702 --> 27:01.555
All the other boys are out
there playing in the water.

27:01.579 --> 27:02.705
Pick up
your knife.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.457
<i>Just like your father.</i>

27:11.172 --> 27:12.381
Good afternoon,
madam.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.135
Go on.

27:16.302 --> 27:17.678
You're sure you're
all right now?

27:17.845 --> 27:19.805
Yes, yes.
Fine, fine.

27:21.349 --> 27:23.225
And what are you
going to do now?

27:23.392 --> 27:24.769
I'm going to take
William and Mary

27:24.852 --> 27:26.228
and explore
this place.

27:26.395 --> 27:29.148
All right. Just don't get
into trouble, will you?

27:29.315 --> 27:30.273
I won't.

27:30.274 --> 27:31.274
Come on.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.657
Excuse me, please.

27:41.786 --> 27:42.828
All right,
that's fine.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.374
Carry on with
the rest of them.

27:46.624 --> 27:48.501
No, in the kitchen.
In the kitchen.

28:41.721 --> 28:42.721
Wait there.

28:58.988 --> 29:00.281
Great.
Now do it again.

29:02.783 --> 29:03.826
Come on, come on.

29:04.243 --> 29:07.246
I'm sure your delegates
will be comfortable in here.

29:07.663 --> 29:09.039
If there's anything
we can do,

29:09.290 --> 29:10.123
obviously...

29:10.124 --> 29:11.444
Come along, Nicola,
down in front!

29:11.584 --> 29:13.419
Please don't hesitate to...
To let me know.

29:13.794 --> 29:16.797
<i>Now, drinks will be served
on the terrace after...</i>

29:17.173 --> 29:18.131
Fine, fine, fine.

29:18.132 --> 29:19.341
You've concluded
your meeting.

29:19.508 --> 29:21.010
<i>Um, skies are clearing...</i>

29:21.260 --> 29:22.428
Come on, ladies.
Sit.

29:22.595 --> 29:23.679
Sit down.

29:23.929 --> 29:26.682
And we've prepared
a fine meal for you tonight.

29:26.766 --> 29:28.267
The chef's special soup...

29:35.399 --> 29:37.568
Hey! Look at her eyes.

29:37.818 --> 29:40.321
<i>Then lamb
and fresh raspberries.</i>

29:41.030 --> 29:42.448
Well, I'll
leave you to it.

29:42.782 --> 29:43.908
Fine. Thank you.

29:44.992 --> 29:46.118
Everybody sitting?

29:47.161 --> 29:48.412
<i>Up front, sit down!</i>

29:48.579 --> 29:50.873
Not... yet!

29:51.457 --> 29:52.666
We gotta get
out of here.

29:52.833 --> 29:53.833
<i>Come along, ladies.</i>

29:53.959 --> 29:56.378
<i>Sooner you're ready,
the sooner we can start.</i>

29:58.756 --> 30:00.883
Thank you very much for
letting me stay, Mr. Stringer.

30:01.050 --> 30:02.050
That's all right,
Elsie.

30:02.176 --> 30:03.219
I'll lock up.

30:03.385 --> 30:04.678
Oh. Right. Ok.

30:04.845 --> 30:05.971
<i>Then we'll begin.</i>

30:36.085 --> 30:38.879
You may remove
your shoes.

30:43.050 --> 30:45.427
<i>You may remove
your wigs.</i>

30:46.846 --> 30:49.473
The doors. Are they
locked and bolted?

30:51.183 --> 30:53.143
Locked and bolted,
your grandness.

30:53.310 --> 30:54.812
Good.
Help me.

30:55.437 --> 30:56.438
No, no, no!

31:17.626 --> 31:18.626
Wow.

31:18.669 --> 31:21.213
<i>Witches of england...</i>

31:23.090 --> 31:25.426
You're a disgrace!

31:26.969 --> 31:29.430
<i>Miserable witches.</i>

31:29.763 --> 31:33.559
<i>You're good-for-nothing
worms!</i>

31:34.393 --> 31:36.228
Everywhere I look...

31:38.981 --> 31:41.734
I see
the repulsive sight

31:41.984 --> 31:43.569
of hundreds...

31:44.737 --> 31:46.906
Thousands...

31:47.031 --> 31:49.575
Of revolting
little children.

31:52.036 --> 31:53.579
I ask you...

31:54.747 --> 31:55.747
Why?

31:59.043 --> 32:01.837
One child a week
is no good to me!

32:02.755 --> 32:03.756
We will do better.

32:04.173 --> 32:05.716
<i>We will do
much better.</i>

32:05.883 --> 32:10.012
Better
is no good, either!

32:11.347 --> 32:12.347
<i>I demand</i>

32:12.848 --> 32:15.267
maximum results.

32:16.477 --> 32:17.477
<i>So...</i>

32:18.896 --> 32:21.440
Here are my orders.

32:22.733 --> 32:24.860
<i>My orders are</i>

32:25.736 --> 32:29.949
that every child
in england

32:30.532 --> 32:32.826
shall be rubbed out.

32:33.327 --> 32:34.787
Destroyed!

32:36.121 --> 32:38.540
Every single child
eliminated!

32:40.542 --> 32:43.837
Do I make myself
clear?

32:44.004 --> 32:45.065
- Yes.
- Yes.

32:48.342 --> 32:50.302
We can't possibly
wipe out all of them.

32:52.429 --> 32:53.764
Who spoke?

32:56.475 --> 32:58.602
<i>Who dares
to argue with me?</i>

33:02.231 --> 33:03.482
It was you?

33:04.108 --> 33:05.651
I didn't mean to argue,
your grandness.

33:05.818 --> 33:08.320
You dare to argue
with me?

33:08.654 --> 33:10.823
No. No, honestly.
It just was a...

33:11.323 --> 33:14.493
a stupid witch
who answers back

33:14.743 --> 33:17.371
must burn until
her bones are black!

33:17.538 --> 33:18.538
No! No!

33:18.622 --> 33:21.834
A foolish witch
without a brain...

33:23.002 --> 33:25.879
Must sizzle
into fiery flame!

33:26.296 --> 33:30.718
A witch who dares
to say I'm wrong...

33:31.802 --> 33:35.389
Will not be with us
very long!

33:39.184 --> 33:40.644
What the devil?!

33:57.619 --> 33:59.913
I hope nobody else

34:00.039 --> 34:02.833
is going to make me
cross today.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.626
- No.
- No.

34:05.002 --> 34:06.002
So...

34:06.378 --> 34:08.464
Now, this
is my plan.

34:09.757 --> 34:11.050
<i>Each of you</i>

34:11.632 --> 34:13.552
will go back
to your homes

34:14.136 --> 34:17.347
and resign
from your jobs.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.016
Give notice.

34:19.558 --> 34:20.433
Retire.

34:20.434 --> 34:21.474
<i>Retire?</i>

34:22.436 --> 34:23.645
<i>You will then buy</i>

34:23.812 --> 34:25.606
with the money
I give you

34:26.190 --> 34:27.565
sweet shops...

34:28.025 --> 34:29.234
Candy stores...

34:30.360 --> 34:31.360
<i>The very best</i>

34:31.445 --> 34:34.656
and most respectable
sweet shops in england.

34:41.455 --> 34:44.875
Upstairs I have a trunkload
of this English money,

34:45.250 --> 34:47.002
so you'll be able
to offer

34:47.210 --> 34:50.714
three, maybe four times
what these shops are worth.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.257
Go, go, go.

34:54.927 --> 34:56.261
<i>On a certain day,</i>

34:56.762 --> 34:59.056
<i>when all our plans
are prepared,</i>

34:59.223 --> 35:04.019
you'll announce
a great gala opening

35:04.186 --> 35:06.980
with free sweets,
candies, and chocolates

35:07.147 --> 35:09.024
<i>for every child.</i>

35:09.191 --> 35:10.651
Poisoned sweets.

35:10.943 --> 35:13.779
We'll wipe them out
like weasels.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.240
- Who spoke?
- She did!

35:18.033 --> 35:19.368
It's brilliant.

35:20.035 --> 35:21.035
Poison?

35:21.995 --> 35:24.414
And you don't mind
getting caught?

35:25.541 --> 35:27.084
Exposed?

35:27.626 --> 35:29.086
Vilified?

35:29.253 --> 35:30.921
Well,
I just thought...

35:31.171 --> 35:33.257
brainless bumpkin!

35:33.423 --> 35:35.384
You blithering
bogvumper!

35:36.343 --> 35:39.263
No wonder england
is swarming with...

35:50.566 --> 35:54.069
Everything you sell
that day

35:54.736 --> 35:56.738
will have been treated

35:57.239 --> 35:59.199
with my very latest

35:59.950 --> 36:03.704
and very greatest
magic formula.

36:04.705 --> 36:08.417
♪♪ Witches work
only with magic ♪♪

36:09.459 --> 36:10.779
Hey, wait. Come here.

36:10.836 --> 36:11.836
William. Mary.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.839
<i>Formula 86.</i>

36:14.798 --> 36:16.508
My greatest triumph.

36:18.010 --> 36:19.678
A work of...

36:20.429 --> 36:21.555
Genius.

36:23.140 --> 36:25.934
Formula 86!

36:26.518 --> 36:28.187
In this bottle,

36:28.437 --> 36:31.106
500 doses

36:31.523 --> 36:33.317
with a delay mechanism

36:33.567 --> 36:36.612
that prevents it from
working until two hours

36:36.820 --> 36:38.280
<i>after it has been taken.</i>

36:41.491 --> 36:43.285
What does it do...

36:43.368 --> 36:44.828
Genius one?

36:44.953 --> 36:46.413
- Yes?
- Yes?

36:46.538 --> 36:48.332
- Yes?
- What?

36:53.712 --> 36:58.508
One dose, and the time
works to the second.

36:59.051 --> 37:01.511
But more
than five doses

37:01.678 --> 37:03.347
breaks
the delay barrier,

37:03.513 --> 37:06.558
and the formula
works instantly.

37:13.607 --> 37:15.776
The child...

37:17.194 --> 37:19.863
Starts to shrink.

37:19.988 --> 37:21.406
- Shrink?
- Shrink?

37:23.951 --> 37:25.535
The child...

37:26.411 --> 37:28.372
Starts to...

37:29.081 --> 37:30.791
Grow fur.

37:31.208 --> 37:32.584
- Fur?
- Fur?

37:34.002 --> 37:35.671
<i>Starts...</i>

37:35.837 --> 37:37.256
Growing a tail.

37:37.422 --> 37:38.423
A tail?

37:38.590 --> 37:40.175
A tail?

37:41.009 --> 37:44.721
All this happens
in precisely 25 seconds!

37:47.933 --> 37:51.645
Shrinking more.

37:55.315 --> 38:00.904
The child is
no longer a child.

38:07.244 --> 38:08.745
The child...

38:11.832 --> 38:13.208
Is a mouse!

38:18.088 --> 38:19.756
<i>Silence. Silence.</i>

38:19.923 --> 38:21.550
<i>Shut up. Shut up.</i>

38:21.633 --> 38:22.718
Silence.

38:23.468 --> 38:24.468
Enough.

38:29.266 --> 38:30.809
<i>This afternoon,</i>

38:31.184 --> 38:33.895
<i>at precisely 4:15,</i>

38:34.271 --> 38:36.815
I put one dose
of my formula

38:36.982 --> 38:38.984
on a bar
of chocolate.

38:40.068 --> 38:44.239
<i>I gave it to
a repulsive, smelly boy</i>

38:44.406 --> 38:45.574
<i>who was in the lobby.</i>

38:48.118 --> 38:51.788
"Was that good?"
I asked him.

38:53.373 --> 38:55.250
"Got any more?"

38:56.251 --> 38:58.295
<i>Said the nauseating child.</i>

38:58.962 --> 39:01.048
"Six more bars
like that one,"

39:01.298 --> 39:02.591
I told him.

39:04.968 --> 39:06.678
<i>In two minutes' time,</i>

39:06.928 --> 39:09.222
this appalling,
foul-smelling creature

39:09.389 --> 39:12.142
is coming to collect
his reward.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.395
In five minutes' time,

39:15.645 --> 39:18.648
you'll see my magic
formula in action.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.403
We're going to see.

39:27.532 --> 39:28.532
Quickly!

39:28.533 --> 39:29.701
Wigs! Gloves!

39:30.077 --> 39:32.412
The appalling child
will be here...

39:32.954 --> 39:34.873
And you'll see
my miracle.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.416
Come on. Hurry up!

39:36.875 --> 39:37.875
<i>Hurry up!</i>

39:38.085 --> 39:39.419
<i>Come on. That's good.</i>

39:40.087 --> 39:41.380
Hurry up, everybody.

39:42.130 --> 39:43.130
Come on!

39:46.218 --> 39:47.636
<i>Quickly! Quickly!</i>

39:47.803 --> 39:48.803
You're not on holiday!

39:48.887 --> 39:51.014
I'm being as quick
as I can.

39:51.181 --> 39:52.181
<i>Hurry up!</i>

40:02.192 --> 40:03.192
Ready.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.864
Hello, little boy.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.950
Come on in, then.

40:10.617 --> 40:12.285
Come on.
Wait just there.

40:12.452 --> 40:13.452
One moment.

40:18.667 --> 40:20.043
Now, what's
your name, then?

40:20.210 --> 40:21.795
Br... Bruno.

40:21.878 --> 40:23.338
Ooh!

40:23.422 --> 40:24.422
Madam.

40:24.881 --> 40:26.091
<i>Madam!</i>

40:40.147 --> 40:43.442
That lady promised me
six whole bars

40:43.608 --> 40:46.862
<i>of cream-whip hazelnut
milk chocolate.</i>

40:50.407 --> 40:52.075
I've come
to collect.

40:54.161 --> 40:55.537
Ladies...

40:56.329 --> 40:58.415
May I introduce Bruno?

40:59.124 --> 41:00.584
Come up, Bruno.

41:01.042 --> 41:02.669
<i>I have
the chocolate here.</i>

41:07.174 --> 41:09.926
I said 6:15...

41:10.385 --> 41:13.263
<i>And that is
in 15 seconds from now.</i>

41:19.186 --> 41:21.730
You are in for a treat.

41:23.190 --> 41:25.734
We all are!

41:32.908 --> 41:34.701
What's going on?

41:35.410 --> 41:37.370
Just a few moments.

41:39.831 --> 41:40.789
5...

41:40.790 --> 41:42.270
<i>I can't even see
any chocolate.</i>

41:42.375 --> 41:43.835
3...

41:44.085 --> 41:45.253
2...

41:45.337 --> 41:46.337
1...

41:46.546 --> 41:47.546
Zero!

41:52.177 --> 41:55.263
We have ignition!

41:57.098 --> 41:59.351
Everybody, look!
It's fantastic!

41:59.518 --> 42:00.852
<i>It's begun!</i>

42:02.771 --> 42:04.689
I can't stand it,
it's so wonderful!

42:04.856 --> 42:07.108
Look at you!
It's fantastic!

42:37.347 --> 42:38.347
Where'd he go?

42:44.145 --> 42:45.145
Bravo!

42:45.480 --> 42:46.480
Keys.

42:46.815 --> 42:47.815
Keys!

42:48.191 --> 42:49.191
Enough!

42:49.276 --> 42:50.318
Silence!

42:50.485 --> 42:51.820
Before the banquet
tonight,

42:51.987 --> 42:53.947
you'll come to my room
in groups of 10.

42:54.656 --> 42:56.283
Room number 208.

42:56.741 --> 42:59.869
I will give you each a bottle
containing 500 doses.

43:00.036 --> 43:01.162
Also plenty of money.

43:01.955 --> 43:04.624
Do not forget your
nose plugs for the dinner.

43:05.083 --> 43:07.168
The dining room will
be full of filthy children,

43:07.335 --> 43:08.712
and without
your nose plugs,

43:08.878 --> 43:10.797
the stink will be
unbearable.

43:11.798 --> 43:13.550
<i>Now we will have drinks
on the terrace</i>

43:13.717 --> 43:15.135
<i>with that ridiculous
manager.</i>

43:15.260 --> 43:16.636
<i>Are there any questions?</i>

43:18.597 --> 43:20.237
What if one of the
chocolates we give away

43:20.307 --> 43:22.475
were accidentally
eaten by a grownup?

43:23.852 --> 43:26.313
Then that's just too bad
for the grownup.

43:26.563 --> 43:27.981
The meeting is over.

43:29.149 --> 43:30.400
Until next year.

43:35.447 --> 43:36.447
Wait!

43:36.698 --> 43:37.698
<i>Wait!</i>

43:38.158 --> 43:39.158
<i>Wait!</i>

43:44.331 --> 43:45.415
I smell...

43:47.375 --> 43:48.375
Dogs' droppings.

43:50.337 --> 43:51.337
<i>What?</i>

43:53.131 --> 43:54.131
She's right.

43:56.593 --> 43:57.969
Oh! The smell!

43:58.345 --> 43:59.346
<i>Ooh! Yuck!</i>

43:59.512 --> 44:00.764
<i>This really
does smell.</i>

44:10.649 --> 44:11.900
She's right!

44:14.819 --> 44:17.530
Search out this small
lump of dung!

44:19.949 --> 44:21.117
<i>Find it!</i>

44:21.826 --> 44:24.996
It must be exterminated
immediately!

44:32.420 --> 44:33.546
<i>There he is!</i>

44:54.192 --> 44:55.312
<i>He's wiggling through!</i>

44:55.360 --> 44:56.736
<i>He's getting away!</i>

44:56.903 --> 44:57.946
Come here, boy.

44:58.780 --> 45:00.115
Bring him to me!

45:18.174 --> 45:19.467
There he is!

45:24.723 --> 45:25.890
Stop him!

45:49.247 --> 45:50.623
I saw him come
this way.

45:50.832 --> 45:52.667
Yes.
Where could he be?

46:08.099 --> 46:09.099
Bye-bye.

46:14.272 --> 46:16.274
Oh, no!

46:19.611 --> 46:20.612
No! My baby!

46:20.779 --> 46:22.030
Stop! Stop!

46:28.453 --> 46:30.288
Oh! My baby!

46:31.164 --> 46:33.208
A baby in a pram.

46:33.416 --> 46:34.416
Oh!

46:37.629 --> 46:39.631
Lovely!

46:51.017 --> 46:52.101
Oh, no.

46:52.769 --> 46:53.769
<i>Get the boy.</i>

46:53.770 --> 46:55.188
He's getting away.

47:37.814 --> 47:38.815
Grandma!

47:39.065 --> 47:40.483
Grandma, wake up!

47:40.900 --> 47:42.443
Oh, please, grandma!

47:44.696 --> 47:45.696
My grandma!

47:46.364 --> 47:49.450
An old adversary,
I have discovered.

47:50.201 --> 47:51.661
<i>Very old.</i>

47:51.870 --> 47:53.705
If you hurt
my grandma...

47:53.872 --> 47:54.914
silence!

47:58.167 --> 48:00.086
We got him,
madam.

48:00.336 --> 48:02.463
We got him,
madam. Oh!

48:06.926 --> 48:08.428
Don't bite.

48:11.055 --> 48:12.098
<i>Open up.</i>

48:14.726 --> 48:17.270
500 doses.

48:22.442 --> 48:24.002
Come along. Come along.
Come on. Up. Up.

48:25.069 --> 48:27.530
- Get up. Get up.
- Come on. Come on.

48:39.709 --> 48:41.878
Look.

48:47.342 --> 48:49.844
This stinking
little carbuncle

48:50.011 --> 48:52.639
has had 500 doses.

48:53.389 --> 48:55.975
We are having
instantaneous action.

49:10.073 --> 49:11.908
Bye.

49:29.592 --> 49:31.511
Kill him.

49:32.053 --> 49:35.556
<i>Kill him!</i>

49:36.808 --> 49:37.808
Kill him!

49:46.401 --> 49:48.319
<i>Leave that little stinkpot!</i>

49:48.695 --> 49:50.071
<i>It's not worth
bothering about.</i>

49:50.863 --> 49:54.033
<i>Come. Some whiskey
and champagne to celebrate.</i>

49:55.535 --> 49:56.535
Bruno?

49:56.577 --> 49:58.579
I don't believe it.
I can talk.

49:59.247 --> 50:00.248
Bruno?

50:03.001 --> 50:04.001
<i>Who's that?</i>

50:04.419 --> 50:06.546
Bruno, it's me...
Luke.

50:08.256 --> 50:09.716
<i>I'm down here.</i>

50:10.633 --> 50:12.385
Where? I can't see you.

50:12.593 --> 50:13.720
<i>Down here.</i>

50:14.387 --> 50:15.471
You can talk, too.

50:15.763 --> 50:16.763
This is weird.

50:21.185 --> 50:22.645
This icing
is terrific.

50:22.812 --> 50:23.812
Are you ok?

50:23.813 --> 50:24.813
They didn't give me

50:24.856 --> 50:26.416
the six bars of
chocolate they promised.

50:26.524 --> 50:29.402
You couldn't eat six bars of
candy now that you're a mouse.

50:29.569 --> 50:31.946
Don't be stupid.
I'm not a...

50:32.280 --> 50:34.532
Now, just because
you're a...

50:34.949 --> 50:37.702
That doesn't mean
that I'm a, uh...

50:38.453 --> 50:39.996
Good lord.

50:40.163 --> 50:41.664
Hmm. Hmm.

50:43.624 --> 50:45.835
Well, I'm not too keen
on being a mouse.

50:46.002 --> 50:47.795
We've got to find
a way out of here.

50:47.920 --> 50:49.922
How long before we change
back, do you think?

50:50.131 --> 50:51.591
I don't think
we will.

50:51.799 --> 50:53.217
Of course we will.

50:53.426 --> 50:55.595
We've gotta get upstairs
and wake my grandma.

50:55.762 --> 50:57.555
I'm real worried
about her.

50:57.972 --> 50:59.515
I mean, maybe
it was the witch...

50:59.682 --> 51:00.975
Or maybe it was
her diabetes.

51:01.517 --> 51:03.936
I only know she didn't
wake up when I...

51:04.562 --> 51:06.397
she's got
some peanuts, too.

51:06.564 --> 51:08.191
Mmm. Dry roasted?

51:08.524 --> 51:09.524
Mm-hmm.

51:09.776 --> 51:11.110
Oh. All right.

51:12.320 --> 51:13.320
Come on.

51:14.405 --> 51:16.783
William and Mary!

51:16.949 --> 51:18.493
Hi. It's me... Luke.

51:18.659 --> 51:19.869
Are you two all right?

51:20.870 --> 51:23.831
Crikey! Did they eat
the chocolates as well?

51:24.082 --> 51:25.208
They were
my pet mice.

51:25.374 --> 51:27.502
But I guess they can't
talk like we can.

51:27.668 --> 51:28.795
Catch you two later.

51:32.632 --> 51:33.632
Hmm.

51:34.550 --> 51:35.968
Come on, Bruno.

51:37.095 --> 51:38.095
This way.

51:40.306 --> 51:41.641
Oh.

51:44.352 --> 51:45.478
Luke?

51:45.978 --> 51:46.978
Luke?

51:47.188 --> 51:48.188
Hmm.

51:56.864 --> 51:57.949
They're gone.

51:58.116 --> 51:59.283
It's all clear,
Bruno.

51:59.659 --> 52:00.659
Come on.

52:00.868 --> 52:02.620
Wait for me.

52:06.040 --> 52:06.998
Running...

52:06.999 --> 52:10.461
Running on a full stomach
isn't good for you.

52:10.628 --> 52:11.629
Better than
being caught.

52:16.008 --> 52:17.009
Keep up, Bruno.

52:17.176 --> 52:19.345
Sports give me
indigestion.

52:24.183 --> 52:25.685
Get back.

52:25.852 --> 52:28.938
Ok, Bruno,
when I say go, go!

52:29.564 --> 52:30.522
Go!

52:30.523 --> 52:31.941
- Run!
- Wait.

52:35.111 --> 52:36.111
Follow me.

52:43.536 --> 52:45.079
How are we gonna
get upstairs?

52:45.746 --> 52:46.621
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

52:46.622 --> 52:47.957
I don't know what
I'm paying for.

52:48.124 --> 52:50.585
I really don't.
An over-heated room...

52:50.793 --> 52:53.421
Dad? Hey!
There's my dad!

52:53.588 --> 52:55.232
<i>Shh! He doesn't
know what's happened.</i>

52:55.256 --> 52:56.299
He'll kill you.
Come on!

52:56.465 --> 52:57.675
My own father?

52:57.758 --> 52:59.635
Whoever took the photos
in that brochure

52:59.802 --> 53:01.429
should be arrested
for fraud.

53:01.637 --> 53:02.805
I'm going to tell him.

53:02.972 --> 53:04.307
He'll put
a stop to it.

53:04.473 --> 53:05.558
No. Not now.

53:05.850 --> 53:07.226
Trust me, Bruno,
please.

53:07.393 --> 53:09.812
He'll stamp on you
the moment he sees you. Quick.

53:13.524 --> 53:16.110
It's so nice not having
the kids around.

53:16.903 --> 53:18.237
<i>I smell food.</i>

53:18.404 --> 53:20.281
- Is there anything in this bag?
- Shh.

53:21.032 --> 53:22.491
They'll be fine.

53:22.575 --> 53:24.493
I think John
was getting a cold.

53:24.619 --> 53:26.162
Look, it's always
the same. You must

53:26.329 --> 53:27.580
relax once in a while.

53:27.705 --> 53:28.706
Oh, all right.

53:30.791 --> 53:31.792
This is it.
Let's go.

53:31.959 --> 53:33.336
Oh, no more sports.

53:33.502 --> 53:34.502
Hurry!

53:36.005 --> 53:37.632
<i>Faster. Faster!</i>

53:38.966 --> 53:40.593
Ooh!
Ouch!

53:40.843 --> 53:42.428
I forgot my tail.

53:42.595 --> 53:44.305
Ooh. Ohh.

53:44.388 --> 53:46.265
Keep to the side,
Bruno.

53:49.227 --> 53:50.227
You know,

53:50.353 --> 53:52.605
being like this
might not be so bad.

53:53.147 --> 53:55.149
There won't be any more
school from now on.

53:55.358 --> 53:56.442
That would be
all right.

53:56.609 --> 53:57.818
Hey, look at that.

53:58.152 --> 53:59.445
Don't eat
the cheese, Bruno.

53:59.612 --> 54:02.198
Remember, from now on,
we've got two enemies...

54:02.365 --> 54:03.532
humans and cats.

54:03.699 --> 54:05.952
Yikes! We've got
three cats at home.

54:06.118 --> 54:07.077
They'll have to go.

54:07.078 --> 54:10.122
My mother loves them,
but she's terrified of mice.

54:11.666 --> 54:12.666
Grandma!

54:13.793 --> 54:15.002
Grandma!

54:18.506 --> 54:20.341
Take your afternoon
off tomorrow.

54:22.218 --> 54:23.344
Oh. Sorry.

54:23.844 --> 54:24.887
Come on, Bruno,
let's go.

54:25.054 --> 54:26.430
What? Hey, wait!

54:27.223 --> 54:29.263
<i>There are four
more floors to be done.</i>

54:29.892 --> 54:31.185
- Yes, sir.
- Hmm.

54:32.353 --> 54:33.896
You do over there.

54:34.105 --> 54:36.023
No. I'll get this one.

54:36.482 --> 54:37.566
Shh. Back.

54:40.945 --> 54:42.530
It bit me!
It bit me!

54:42.697 --> 54:43.990
- What bit you?
- A mouse!

54:44.156 --> 54:45.156
<i>In the towel.</i>

54:45.700 --> 54:46.993
A mouse?

54:47.159 --> 54:48.619
A mouse?

54:52.331 --> 54:53.331
Oh, no.

54:56.502 --> 54:57.545
Is she sober?

54:57.920 --> 54:58.963
Yes, of course
she's sober.

54:59.130 --> 55:00.423
I've been with her
all aftern...

55:01.090 --> 55:04.343
uh, I... I... i, uh...
I saw her...

55:04.635 --> 55:06.220
Yes, she's sober.
Don't be stupid.

55:06.721 --> 55:08.431
<i>Go and do
the second floor.</i>

55:08.597 --> 55:09.640
<i>Grandma!</i>

55:09.932 --> 55:10.975
<i>Grandma!</i>

55:11.809 --> 55:12.810
<i>Here by the phone.</i>

55:15.187 --> 55:16.439
It's me... Luke.

55:18.524 --> 55:19.775
<i>Are you all right?</i>

55:22.486 --> 55:23.486
Luke?

55:24.155 --> 55:25.489
<i>It's me, grandma.</i>

55:28.117 --> 55:29.117
Luke!

55:29.118 --> 55:30.369
It was the grand
high witch.

55:30.619 --> 55:31.662
She's in this hotel!

55:31.829 --> 55:33.456
Oh, my god!

55:33.998 --> 55:35.207
<i>Don't cry, grandma.</i>

55:35.416 --> 55:36.374
It's ok.

55:36.375 --> 55:37.877
Things could
have been worse.

55:38.377 --> 55:39.628
I got away
from 'em.

55:39.795 --> 55:40.963
I'm still alive.

55:41.589 --> 55:43.299
Oh, my darling Luke.

55:43.799 --> 55:45.509
<i>What have they
done to you?</i>

55:45.676 --> 55:47.553
They turned me
into a mouse.

55:47.720 --> 55:51.307
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.
I can't stop shaking.

55:52.767 --> 55:55.186
The grand high witch...
here?

55:55.353 --> 55:56.393
There's hundreds
of them...

55:56.479 --> 55:57.772
Right here
in this hotel.

55:58.397 --> 55:59.565
I knew it.

55:59.732 --> 56:01.609
I could see it
in her eyes.

56:01.776 --> 56:02.692
Oh, lord.

56:03.986 --> 56:05.821
You squashed me.

56:06.781 --> 56:07.781
- Huh?
<i>- Grandma,</i>

56:07.782 --> 56:09.408
this is
Bruno Jenkins.

56:09.575 --> 56:10.575
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

56:10.618 --> 56:13.496
he said you've got
dry roast peanuts.

56:14.246 --> 56:15.956
Yes. Oh, yes.

56:16.123 --> 56:17.833
<i>Oh, good.
Thanks.</i>

56:20.628 --> 56:22.088
<i>We've gotta
stop them, grandma.</i>

56:22.296 --> 56:24.423
They leave tomorrow
with a bundle of money

56:24.590 --> 56:25.841
and gallons
of a formula

56:26.008 --> 56:27.718
that'll change
every kid in england

56:27.885 --> 56:30.721
into a mouse.
We must stop them.

56:32.515 --> 56:34.308
<i>- Miss Ernst.</i>
- Lois.

56:36.060 --> 56:38.062
Nice to see a bit of
international clientele.

56:38.562 --> 56:39.562
How do you do?

56:39.688 --> 56:40.688
Just flew in,
did you?

56:40.815 --> 56:41.773
What?

56:41.774 --> 56:44.360
Jet lag's the curse
of the business classes.

56:44.860 --> 56:46.612
Hope you don't mind
me joining you.

56:46.779 --> 56:48.280
You're most welcome, sir.

56:49.698 --> 56:50.783
<i>Herbert Jenkins.</i>

56:51.242 --> 56:52.200
I'd like
to say hello

56:52.201 --> 56:53.577
to a fellow
philanthropist.

56:53.994 --> 56:55.579
You collect stamps?

56:55.746 --> 56:56.789
<i>Charities.</i>

56:57.248 --> 56:59.667
This rspcc.

56:59.875 --> 57:01.001
What is this rsp...

57:01.168 --> 57:02.448
Cruelty to children!

57:02.586 --> 57:04.213
Oh, of course.

57:04.380 --> 57:06.382
You give money

57:09.051 --> 57:10.051
Children.

57:10.136 --> 57:12.805
And...
We, of course,

57:13.389 --> 57:15.391
we also give money
for the little...

57:17.977 --> 57:19.913
<i>I see you're holding
your annual meeting.</i>

57:19.937 --> 57:20.980
<i>Funny enough,</i>

57:21.313 --> 57:23.274
I recently addressed
the last annual meeting

57:23.441 --> 57:25.109
of our rotary club.
I wonder

57:25.276 --> 57:26.756
<i>if you know much
about the rotary club</i>

57:26.819 --> 57:28.654
<i>organization
in this country?</i>

57:32.741 --> 57:34.827
<i>I could get the
formula into their food.</i>

57:36.537 --> 57:38.897
You just have to get me down
to the grand high witch's room,

57:38.998 --> 57:41.000
grandma. I'm ready.

57:42.334 --> 57:43.586
I don't know.

57:43.752 --> 57:46.255
I've gotta find
the formula, grandma.

57:46.422 --> 57:48.966
No. This is
too dangerous.

57:49.300 --> 57:50.634
Grandma!

57:53.554 --> 57:55.514
It's not far down,
grandma.

57:55.848 --> 57:57.391
You're asking me
to lower you

57:57.558 --> 57:58.976
into the jaws of death.

57:59.101 --> 58:01.645
You two can't take on
the grand high witch.

58:01.979 --> 58:04.231
Yes, we can.
We've got to.

58:04.607 --> 58:06.317
No one else is
going to believe us.

58:06.484 --> 58:08.110
Quick, before
she comes back.

58:12.573 --> 58:13.699
Luke...

58:17.077 --> 58:18.829
Luke, be careful.

58:19.955 --> 58:21.332
Please be careful.

58:21.499 --> 58:23.792
I'll be careful.
Don't worry.

58:24.335 --> 58:25.628
Not so fast.

58:35.137 --> 58:36.639
Be careful.

58:36.805 --> 58:38.724
I will, I will.

58:48.317 --> 58:50.152
Oh, no.

58:52.571 --> 58:53.571
Grandma!

58:55.199 --> 58:56.450
<i>Luke, what happened?</i>

58:56.617 --> 58:57.617
<i>Are you all right?</i>

58:57.743 --> 59:00.663
<i>Luke? Why don't
you answer?</i>

59:04.124 --> 59:05.209
Down, cat.

59:05.626 --> 59:06.626
<i>No, cat.</i>

59:09.088 --> 59:10.714
Grandma! Help!

59:15.511 --> 59:16.511
<i>Down, cat!</i>

59:16.595 --> 59:18.264
Oh, no. Go, cat.

59:18.430 --> 59:19.430
<i>Luke!</i>

59:20.349 --> 59:21.349
<i>Grandma!</i>

59:22.309 --> 59:23.978
Get away.
Help! Help!

59:24.144 --> 59:26.730
Get him away, grandma!
Help, grandma!

59:28.399 --> 59:29.399
Grandma, help!

59:29.692 --> 59:30.818
<i>Help me, grandma!</i>

59:31.527 --> 59:32.485
Puss!

59:32.486 --> 59:35.072
Grandma, come on!
Do something, grandma!

59:35.406 --> 59:36.740
<i>Get it.
Get it, cat.</i>

59:37.032 --> 59:39.118
Cat. Cat.
Puss. Puss. Puss.

59:39.285 --> 59:40.995
Come here. Take it.

59:43.080 --> 59:44.164
<i>Luke!</i>

59:44.873 --> 59:46.208
<i>Keep him there,
grandma.</i>

59:46.750 --> 59:48.210
<i>Come on,
you little kitten.</i>

59:48.377 --> 59:49.461
<i>Come on, pussy.</i>

59:49.837 --> 59:50.921
Keep him busy.

59:52.590 --> 59:54.174
<i>Here. Take it.</i>

59:59.638 --> 01:00:01.348
<i>Ah, come on.
Come on.</i>

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:02.891
<i>Take it,
you silly cat.</i>

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:05.185
Don't let him in,
grandma.

01:00:05.436 --> 01:00:06.562
Puss. Puss, puss.

01:00:07.354 --> 01:00:08.897
<i>Here. Here.</i>

01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:24.287
Whoa!

01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:25.914
Hang on, tail.

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:34.840
Come on, formula.
Where are you?

01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:38.135
Come on, come on.

01:00:46.477 --> 01:00:47.561
Oh, no.

01:00:54.485 --> 01:00:55.527
Whoa!

01:00:57.029 --> 01:00:58.029
Oh, no.

01:01:00.449 --> 01:01:03.661
It has been unforgettable,
Mr. Jenkins.

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:04.995
My pleasure, madam.

01:01:05.537 --> 01:01:07.373
What a stimulating
conversation it has been.

01:01:07.539 --> 01:01:09.059
It's not every day
that one meets a lady

01:01:09.083 --> 01:01:12.002
<i>of such quality
and... And compassion.</i>

01:01:16.632 --> 01:01:17.883
Whoa!

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:29.311
It's gotta be
somewhere up here.

01:01:29.478 --> 01:01:30.854
It's just gotta be.

01:01:35.526 --> 01:01:37.319
Whoa! Ohh!

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:39.238
Ow!

01:01:39.405 --> 01:01:40.405
Oh, man.

01:01:42.533 --> 01:01:43.659
Hey!

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.497
We've got it, grandma.

01:01:51.792 --> 01:01:54.461
<i>Did you realize
that was Bruno's father?</i>

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:56.130
<i>What a nasty man.</i>

01:01:56.296 --> 01:01:57.536
<i>It's an act of mercy
on my part.</i>

01:01:57.673 --> 01:01:58.589
Uh-oh.

01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:01.135
<i>The child will never
grow up to be like the father.</i>

01:02:02.553 --> 01:02:03.554
Thanks.

01:02:03.804 --> 01:02:04.888
<i>Liebchen?</i>

01:02:06.849 --> 01:02:07.849
Liebchen?

01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:10.352
- Lipshin?
<i>- Liebchen?</i>

01:02:10.519 --> 01:02:11.770
Lipshin?

01:02:11.937 --> 01:02:13.272
<i>Liebchen?</i>

01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:17.568
<i>Liebchen.</i>

01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:20.404
<i>Was ist das?</i>

01:02:21.572 --> 01:02:24.867
Oh. I... I'm so sorry.
I... I dropped my knitting.

01:02:25.033 --> 01:02:25.992
You!

01:02:25.993 --> 01:02:29.997
I'm... I... i'm, uh, knitting
something for my grandson.

01:02:30.164 --> 01:02:31.749
You haven't seen him,
by any chance?

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:32.916
No, no.

01:02:33.459 --> 01:02:34.459
Come, <i>liebchen.</i>

01:02:34.585 --> 01:02:36.211
I'm dreadfully sorry.

01:02:36.378 --> 01:02:37.755
<i>I do apologize.</i>

01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:39.590
That's quite all right.

01:02:39.798 --> 01:02:42.301
If I see your grandson,
I will...

01:02:44.219 --> 01:02:46.013
I will turn him
into a mouse.

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:47.639
And you,
meddling old woman,

01:02:47.806 --> 01:02:49.099
I will deal with later.

01:02:50.392 --> 01:02:51.643
<i>Liebchen.</i>

01:02:56.607 --> 01:02:59.067
I do hope we're not
the first.

01:03:00.152 --> 01:03:01.403
- Miss Ernst!
- Ahh!

01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:03.655
Who is this?

01:03:03.822 --> 01:03:06.742
You told them to come up
after the drinks.

01:03:06.825 --> 01:03:09.286
Oh. All right.
Let them in.

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:17.461
Come in.

01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:19.671
You were wonderful
this afternoon.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:23.717
Ohh!

01:03:23.926 --> 01:03:25.219
You bad cat, <i>liebchen.</i>

01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:26.804
You're early,
in fact.

01:03:41.777 --> 01:03:44.613
So... When do you think
they'd implement it?

01:03:44.696 --> 01:03:46.907
First of
the year, I suppose.

01:03:47.074 --> 01:03:49.076
She's a very pleasant
woman.

01:03:49.243 --> 01:03:50.720
Yes. Now,
the question is,

01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:52.329
would she like
to work with us?

01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:54.540
Ow! Oh...

01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:02.297
Whew!

01:04:12.724 --> 01:04:14.226
Grandma, grandma!
I've got it!

01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:15.727
I've got the formula.

01:04:15.894 --> 01:04:17.479
Oh, thank god.

01:04:18.313 --> 01:04:20.065
Luke, darling,
I was so worried.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:23.193
There's 500 doses in this
one little bottle, grandma.

01:04:23.318 --> 01:04:24.712
It's enough to change
all the witches

01:04:24.736 --> 01:04:26.530
in this hotel.

01:04:27.281 --> 01:04:28.949
Where's Bruno?

01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:31.827
There's some jolly good
grapes here.

01:04:31.994 --> 01:04:33.328
What's happening?

01:04:33.412 --> 01:04:35.539
Nothing until dinnertime.

01:04:35.706 --> 01:04:37.916
Now, we've got to get you
back to your parents.

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:40.502
What time
is it?

01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:41.670
7:00.

01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:43.171
They'll be in the bar.

01:04:43.255 --> 01:04:47.217
A Sherry and a large malt whiskey
and soda at 7:00 sharp.

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:49.094
It gives you
an appetite.

01:04:49.261 --> 01:04:50.679
Does it?

01:04:50.846 --> 01:04:52.014
Come on.

01:04:52.139 --> 01:04:55.684
Into my handbag,
both of you.

01:04:55.851 --> 01:04:58.395
This is going
to be difficult.

01:04:58.478 --> 01:05:00.063
Oh, I'm full.

01:05:00.147 --> 01:05:01.541
After that, we've
gotta get to the kitchen

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:02.649
as quick as we can.

01:05:02.941 --> 01:05:04.902
That tickles.

01:05:07.279 --> 01:05:08.655
Is that them?

01:05:08.822 --> 01:05:10.866
Yes.
Listen, grandma.

01:05:10.991 --> 01:05:12.075
Maybe we
ought to...

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:13.285
shh.

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:14.786
Wait! Listen...

01:05:17.998 --> 01:05:19.625
Don't drown it.

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:20.833
Oh, sorry.

01:05:21.001 --> 01:05:22.502
Now look what
you've done!

01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:24.004
She was drowning it.

01:05:24.171 --> 01:05:26.882
Are you Mr.
and Mrs. Jenkins?

01:05:27.007 --> 01:05:28.425
Hole in one, madam.

01:05:28.508 --> 01:05:30.093
What can we do for you?

01:05:30.177 --> 01:05:32.054
I would like to have
a word with you

01:05:32.179 --> 01:05:33.430
about your son.

01:05:33.639 --> 01:05:36.016
Sit down, sit down.

01:05:36.308 --> 01:05:39.645
Now, what's the little
tyke been up to now?

01:05:39.853 --> 01:05:42.022
Raiding the kitchen,
I suppose.

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:46.818
If we could go somewhere
more private...

01:05:46.944 --> 01:05:48.654
Private?

01:05:48.779 --> 01:05:51.031
Well, it is rather a...

01:05:51.323 --> 01:05:52.950
Personal matter.

01:05:53.158 --> 01:05:55.285
Look, Mrs. Whatever
your name is,

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:58.789
if Bruno has broken a window
or smashed your spectacles,

01:05:58.956 --> 01:06:01.833
I'll pay for it, but we're
not budging out of this seat.

01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:03.293
We always sit
at this table.

01:06:03.418 --> 01:06:04.795
Where is Bruno, anyway?

01:06:04.962 --> 01:06:07.381
You tell him to come
here and see me.

01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:09.675
He is here already.

01:06:10.342 --> 01:06:11.342
What?

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.679
In my handbag.

01:06:13.804 --> 01:06:17.307
Your son has
suffered a mishap.

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:21.144
He has been
drastically altered.

01:06:21.228 --> 01:06:24.356
Altered? What do
you mean, altered?

01:06:24.523 --> 01:06:28.360
Well, I'm trying to tell you
as gently as possible.

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:31.780
My grandson saw them
doing it to him.

01:06:31.863 --> 01:06:33.615
Saw who doing what?

01:06:34.533 --> 01:06:40.205
Saw the witches turn
him into a mouse.

01:06:42.374 --> 01:06:43.667
Are you crackers?

01:06:45.836 --> 01:06:47.546
Look, get the manager, dear.

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:49.965
Tell them to throw this old
nutcase out of the hotel.

01:06:50.048 --> 01:06:52.426
You need a funny farm,
you do.

01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:55.220
Tell them, Bruno.

01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:57.806
A mouse!

01:06:57.931 --> 01:06:58.932
Shh!

01:06:59.016 --> 01:07:01.935
I can't stand them!
Get it away from me!

01:07:02.019 --> 01:07:05.063
It is Bruno.
Come on, tell them, Bruno.

01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:07.024
Get out of here!
How dare you?

01:07:07.149 --> 01:07:08.859
Come on.
Tell them, Bruno.

01:07:09.026 --> 01:07:10.944
It's Bruno.

01:07:11.028 --> 01:07:12.696
It's me, mum. I...

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:15.574
out! Out! Out before
I call the police,

01:07:15.741 --> 01:07:16.968
you barmy old looney.
Just go on!

01:07:16.992 --> 01:07:18.511
- Take your stupid little...
- Why don't they recognize me?

01:07:18.535 --> 01:07:19.828
Push off!

01:07:20.037 --> 01:07:22.330
Never come back,
you stupid old witch!

01:07:22.497 --> 01:07:24.207
I did my best,
Bruno.

01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:26.251
Don't worry, dear.
Just go on.

01:07:28.503 --> 01:07:29.629
Evening, madam.

01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:31.882
I'm just popping in
to turn down your bed.

01:07:32.424 --> 01:07:33.717
How is
the room service here?

01:07:33.884 --> 01:07:34.926
Diabolical.

01:07:35.052 --> 01:07:36.136
Good.

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:37.488
How do you know
that woman upstairs?

01:07:37.512 --> 01:07:39.741
Come along! Walk downstairs.
The elevator is out of order.

01:07:39.765 --> 01:07:40.766
Is it?

01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:42.184
Must be.

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:44.144
It's a five-course meal.

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:46.021
Good.
I'm rather hungry.

01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:21.807
Mmm.

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:29.564
Oh...

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:39.241
Mmm.

01:09:02.514 --> 01:09:05.475
I'd like to go home.
That's what I'd like.

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:06.725
What are you
doing here?

01:09:06.935 --> 01:09:08.145
The banquet,
miss Ernst.

01:09:08.228 --> 01:09:10.564
No, no, no! You must go
to your room and prepare for...

01:09:10.647 --> 01:09:11.648
hello!

01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:14.776
For tomorrow's flight.
Yes, have a good flight.

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:16.319
But it's
our banquet.

01:09:16.403 --> 01:09:18.904
You are not here
to enjoy yourself!

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:20.573
You are here
as my staff!

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:23.660
Go to your room now.

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:25.162
Ladies.

01:09:28.122 --> 01:09:29.791
I quit!

01:09:43.138 --> 01:09:44.346
I can't go
through with it.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.099
We could run away,
go home, yes?

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.602
Grandma,
if we don't try,

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:51.020
every mother and
father in england

01:09:51.188 --> 01:09:52.814
will lose
their kids.

01:09:53.314 --> 01:09:54.316
I know.

01:09:54.399 --> 01:09:55.901
We must do it,
grandma.

01:09:55.984 --> 01:09:58.862
8:03 now.
8:15 exactly.

01:09:58.945 --> 01:09:59.945
I'll remember.

01:09:59.988 --> 01:10:01.907
Luke, darling,
I'm so terrified.

01:10:02.032 --> 01:10:03.366
Grandma, now!

01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:08.371
No, no, no, madame.
Please, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:10.020
The dining room is
down the corridor.

01:10:10.165 --> 01:10:12.167
I am sorry, truly.

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:14.836
The guests are not
permitted, madame.

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.088
I am sorry, but...

01:10:52.249 --> 01:10:54.042
They want more bread rolls.
They ready yet?

01:10:54.125 --> 01:10:55.543
One moment.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.880
Where are my peas?
Where are my peas?

01:11:06.805 --> 01:11:10.809
And how is the cress soup for
the children's charity group?

01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:13.728
The soup!

01:11:14.354 --> 01:11:16.022
Very good,
but no more salt.

01:11:16.106 --> 01:11:17.649
No more?

01:11:19.526 --> 01:11:20.819
Hmm!

01:11:27.826 --> 01:11:30.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:45.969
They're everywhere!

01:11:51.266 --> 01:11:53.643
Chef, table five says
the veal's too tough.

01:11:53.768 --> 01:11:55.603
I will take care
of this personally.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:01.735
Chef!

01:12:01.943 --> 01:12:03.028
Chef!

01:12:03.111 --> 01:12:06.656
The rspcc party
all want soup.

01:12:06.865 --> 01:12:08.283
That's 87
for watercress.

01:12:08.366 --> 01:12:10.744
Debby, bring
the soup tureens.

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:12.287
Well, he will adore it now.

01:12:12.454 --> 01:12:14.205
The magic touch,
<i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

01:12:33.433 --> 01:12:34.350
Whoa.

01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:35.352
Whoa.

01:12:35.477 --> 01:12:36.435
Whoa.

01:12:36.436 --> 01:12:37.979
Whoa.

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:40.690
Whoa.

01:12:40.774 --> 01:12:43.902
Right, Debbie. I'll just check
the soup before it's served.

01:12:44.819 --> 01:12:46.488
Whoa. Whoa.

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.656
Oh. Oh, god.

01:12:54.204 --> 01:12:56.456
She's eating the soup.

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:05.673
I'll see you
later, then.

01:13:05.799 --> 01:13:08.343
But we're short-staffed
tonight.

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.016
Well, I... I may be
a little late.

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:17.227
I can wait.

01:13:28.196 --> 01:13:29.614
What is it?

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:42.210
Now,

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:46.881
- Ow!
- Got you!

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:49.092
A mouse!

01:13:49.259 --> 01:13:51.636
It's a mouse!

01:13:52.387 --> 01:13:55.348
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

01:13:55.432 --> 01:13:56.951
- Get him off! Get him off!
- It's in me underpants.

01:13:56.975 --> 01:13:58.726
It's running around
in me bloody underpants!

01:13:58.810 --> 01:14:01.646
For goodness' sake,
get out of the way.

01:14:02.397 --> 01:14:03.773
Oh!

01:14:03.898 --> 01:14:05.608
Get it out!
Somebody help me!

01:14:05.692 --> 01:14:07.277
Take your trousers off,
you idiot!

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.654
Take your pants off.
We have to get to it.

01:14:09.737 --> 01:14:11.030
Oh, give me that.

01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:14.284
Somebody get it out
before it bites me!

01:14:15.702 --> 01:14:17.495
Phew! I gotta
get out of here.

01:14:17.579 --> 01:14:21.332
Somebody, get it out!
Oh!

01:14:21.416 --> 01:14:22.709
I saw it.

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:24.752
- See it?
- Nothing.

01:14:26.337 --> 01:14:27.922
There's nothing much
in there.

01:14:30.175 --> 01:14:33.052
A lot of fuss about nothing.
Christ.

01:14:36.347 --> 01:14:38.057
It's gone.

01:14:48.109 --> 01:14:49.110
Oi!

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:57.243
Yes?

01:14:57.327 --> 01:14:58.578
What kind of soup
is that?

01:14:58.661 --> 01:15:00.914
That is
the cress soup, sir.

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:02.349
Well, if they're all
having cress soup,

01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:04.959
I'll have a cress
soup, thank you.

01:15:05.043 --> 01:15:07.170
Yes, that soup is specially
made for their party, sir.

01:15:07.253 --> 01:15:10.507
The soup on the menu
tonight is cock-a-leekie,

01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:12.675
and very nice
it is, too.

01:15:12.759 --> 01:15:14.677
Yes, but I don't want
cock-a-leekie.

01:15:14.761 --> 01:15:16.596
I don't like
cock-a-leekie.

01:15:16.679 --> 01:15:18.056
I like cress.
So just

01:15:18.139 --> 01:15:19.265
take that back
to the kitchen

01:15:19.349 --> 01:15:20.409
and tell
the <i>chef de cuisine</i>

01:15:20.433 --> 01:15:22.352
that there's one more
order for cress soup.

01:15:22.435 --> 01:15:24.270
Now, there's a laddie.

01:15:40.119 --> 01:15:42.247
What's that, then?

01:15:56.844 --> 01:15:58.930
Don't touch it!
It's in the soup!

01:15:59.013 --> 01:16:00.390
Don't touch the soup!

01:16:00.473 --> 01:16:02.392
Child!

01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:05.728
Good.

01:16:05.853 --> 01:16:07.647
Come along.

01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:15.613
Nearly 8:15.

01:16:18.366 --> 01:16:20.535
Oh, I can't believe
that she's still here.

01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:21.619
Dear me!

01:16:21.703 --> 01:16:23.288
Oh, no, no, no.
No, madam, please.

01:16:23.371 --> 01:16:25.498
Please.
Just a moment.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:38.344
8:15. I made it!

01:16:41.306 --> 01:16:43.057
One more...

01:16:43.808 --> 01:16:46.728
one more cress soup,
table nine.

01:16:51.858 --> 01:16:53.610
Get moving.

01:17:21.054 --> 01:17:22.138
Hi, Bruno.

01:17:24.098 --> 01:17:25.808
Lovely, isn't it?

01:17:25.892 --> 01:17:27.101
Red.

01:17:27.185 --> 01:17:29.937
Yes. Red.

01:17:34.942 --> 01:17:37.445
<i>I didn't want to be
one of them anywa y.</i>

01:17:41.491 --> 01:17:43.660
I'll bring you
your main course.

01:17:44.494 --> 01:17:45.828
Well?

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:46.996
I put it
in the soup.

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.081
The whole bottle?

01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:49.165
Every drop.

01:17:49.248 --> 01:17:51.501
You angel.

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:53.378
You're bleeding.

01:17:53.461 --> 01:17:54.921
One of the cooks
tried to cut off

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:57.757
my tail with a carving knife.
Look!

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:00.343
The grand high witch
is eating the soup!

01:18:03.513 --> 01:18:05.306
They all are.

01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:15.733
Would you like
another roll, sir?

01:18:15.817 --> 01:18:17.694
Oh. No, thanks.

01:18:17.777 --> 01:18:20.029
I'd like some... Yes.

01:18:20.113 --> 01:18:22.156
I'd like some...

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:24.200
I'd like some
black pepper, please.

01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:25.868
Oh, my god.

01:18:25.952 --> 01:18:26.953
What?

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:30.373
Bruno's father is about
to eat the soup, too.

01:18:30.873 --> 01:18:31.999
- Stop him!
- Quick!

01:18:32.125 --> 01:18:33.394
Oh, so that's it.

01:18:33.418 --> 01:18:35.712
Our wee break,
it's been a nightmare.

01:18:36.254 --> 01:18:38.423
At least we got
some cress soup.

01:18:38.506 --> 01:18:40.800
Don't touch it!

01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:42.528
I told you she was a loony.

01:18:42.552 --> 01:18:44.011
She's an absolute nutter!

01:18:44.804 --> 01:18:46.723
Look at
my bloody soup!

01:18:46.931 --> 01:18:48.933
All that stuff
about Bruno!

01:18:49.016 --> 01:18:52.562
Bruno has been
turned into...

01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:54.605
he has not been
turned into a m...

01:18:54.689 --> 01:18:56.733
Yes, I have. Hello, dad.

01:19:04.198 --> 01:19:07.618
Don't worry, dad.
It isn't all bad...

01:19:07.702 --> 01:19:10.246
Well, just so long as
the cat doesn't get me.

01:19:10.455 --> 01:19:11.622
Bruno.

01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:14.542
No more school,
no more homework.

01:19:14.625 --> 01:19:16.919
I'll live in
the kitchen cupboard.

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:19.797
No, no, no. This is...
This is a trick.

01:19:20.757 --> 01:19:21.841
It's that whiskey.

01:19:23.009 --> 01:19:24.302
Hello, mum.

01:19:26.304 --> 01:19:28.890
Would you like to know
who did this to Bruno?

01:19:37.356 --> 01:19:38.357
It's working!

01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:45.406
What's going on?

01:19:48.242 --> 01:19:49.994
Let go of me!

01:19:53.372 --> 01:19:55.416
My formula 86!

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:56.542
Give me that spoon!

01:19:58.169 --> 01:20:00.213
That woman over there.

01:20:02.757 --> 01:20:06.219
She is
the grand high witch.

01:20:09.514 --> 01:20:12.391
Grandma, she needs
more time to become a...

01:20:15.186 --> 01:20:17.688
She did it to Bruno...

01:20:17.814 --> 01:20:23.903
And thousands of other
children before him.

01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:27.573
Good evening.

01:20:27.657 --> 01:20:30.576
You're... you're doomed,
old woman!

01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:32.745
You're doomed forever!

01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:34.121
It must work, grandma.

01:20:34.247 --> 01:20:35.748
Oh, you... aah!

01:20:35.873 --> 01:20:37.250
Bruno!

01:20:37.792 --> 01:20:39.710
No, Bruno.

01:20:43.714 --> 01:20:45.234
- This is it, Bruno.
- It worked great.

01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:57.103
Come on!

01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:58.729
Get the mice!

01:20:58.813 --> 01:21:00.898
Get them all!
I don't care how!

01:21:00.982 --> 01:21:02.441
Just get them out of here.

01:21:05.361 --> 01:21:07.738
Get that one over there.
The one in the wig.

01:21:09.282 --> 01:21:12.410
The most evil and appalling
woman in the world.

01:21:12.535 --> 01:21:17.999
A loathsome,
hideous disgrace!

01:21:18.124 --> 01:21:19.584
Yeah, grandma!

01:21:19.667 --> 01:21:24.297
I'm not finished
with you yet, old woman!

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.173
Next time!

01:21:26.257 --> 01:21:27.300
No!

01:21:27.425 --> 01:21:29.176
No next time.

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:32.763
This time
it's your turn.

01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:45.391
Herbert! Herbert,
do something!

01:21:45.443 --> 01:21:48.321
Hold still for a second.
It's in your foundation garment.

01:21:48.446 --> 01:21:50.448
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:21:50.531 --> 01:21:52.742
Mr.
- Gotcha.

01:21:53.492 --> 01:21:54.577
Get that brown one!

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.287
No, not that one.
The other one, there!

01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:57.997
Yeah, there.
The one in the tights.

01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:59.707
Look, grandma,
it's her.

01:22:01.292 --> 01:22:03.294
Get away from me.
Get away from me.

01:22:03.377 --> 01:22:05.713
Don't let her
get away.

01:22:05.796 --> 01:22:07.256
Get away from me!

01:22:10.551 --> 01:22:13.679
Hey! Get me
out of here! Help!

01:22:15.932 --> 01:22:19.185
Get... get out
of my hotel!

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.647
Mr. Stringer.

01:22:22.730 --> 01:22:23.940
Mr. Stringer.

01:22:24.065 --> 01:22:25.066
Yes, madam.

01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:26.335
There's an especially
infectious one

01:22:26.359 --> 01:22:28.444
over there...
Under the water jug.

01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:31.280
- Thank you, madam.
- Oh, it's a pleasure.

01:22:31.364 --> 01:22:32.448
Get away from me!

01:22:32.531 --> 01:22:35.701
Get away from me, I tell you.
Get away from me!

01:22:35.826 --> 01:22:37.078
Get me out of here!

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:38.287
Get away!

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:39.789
Get away from me,
I say!

01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:41.123
No!

01:22:43.918 --> 01:22:45.336
Ugh.

01:22:52.426 --> 01:22:54.845
My mum's not
very crazy about mice.

01:22:55.012 --> 01:22:56.806
So I see.

01:22:58.683 --> 01:22:59.976
Here is Bruno.

01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:01.686
Oh. Thank you.

01:23:01.852 --> 01:23:03.813
He needs to go
on a diet.

01:23:04.897 --> 01:23:06.983
Hi, dad. Hi, mum.

01:23:07.066 --> 01:23:08.502
No, stop it. Stop it, dear.

01:23:08.526 --> 01:23:09.610
Stop it.

01:23:09.735 --> 01:23:12.363
This is our Bruno.

01:23:12.697 --> 01:23:14.156
Don't cry, mum.

01:23:14.281 --> 01:23:16.117
You'll get used to me.

01:23:18.202 --> 01:23:19.578
Just a minute, grandma.

01:23:19.745 --> 01:23:20.997
Bye, Bruno.

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:22.748
Bye.

01:23:22.873 --> 01:23:24.542
Excuse me.

01:23:26.043 --> 01:23:29.505
Oh, mum. You always wanted me
to lose weight.

01:23:29.588 --> 01:23:31.716
Well, look at me now.

01:23:40.224 --> 01:23:42.852
There. But I still
don't understand.

01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:44.520
I won't be long.

01:23:51.277 --> 01:23:52.820
Come on. This way.

01:23:52.903 --> 01:23:55.072
Mice in
the main dining room.

01:23:55.156 --> 01:23:56.236
Come on, hurry up.
Hurry up.

01:23:56.282 --> 01:23:58.200
- Your taxi, madam.
- Goodbye.

01:23:58.284 --> 01:23:59.785
Thank you.

01:24:03.622 --> 01:24:05.416
Let's get away!

01:24:24.894 --> 01:24:27.563
Put it down, bill.
That's it.

01:24:27.688 --> 01:24:31.233
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:24:31.358 --> 01:24:33.235
- Can you manage?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:24:33.319 --> 01:24:35.362
Look out.
There's a step.

01:24:38.365 --> 01:24:40.117
- Mrs. Eveshim?
- Yes, it is.

01:24:40.201 --> 01:24:42.870
- There's a trunk for you.
- A trunk?

01:24:42.953 --> 01:24:44.163
Will you sign for it?

01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:45.956
Yes, all right.

01:24:46.082 --> 01:24:47.166
Come in.

01:24:48.667 --> 01:24:50.711
Oh, great!
Great! It's arrived!

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.296
Don't open it yet,
grandma.

01:24:52.379 --> 01:24:53.714
Wait for me.

01:24:53.798 --> 01:24:55.358
Put it down there.
That'll do fine.

01:24:55.382 --> 01:24:56.425
All right.

01:24:57.384 --> 01:24:58.677
Oh, that's it. Yeah.

01:24:59.845 --> 01:25:01.097
Here I come.

01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:02.598
Ow.

01:25:02.681 --> 01:25:03.974
- Thank you.
- Thank you, madam.

01:25:04.058 --> 01:25:07.019
But I still have no idea
who it could be from.

01:25:07.770 --> 01:25:09.855
This is really
gonna surprise ya.

01:25:12.316 --> 01:25:13.943
Okay. Open it, grandma.

01:25:14.068 --> 01:25:15.653
Yes, but what is it?

01:25:15.736 --> 01:25:16.821
Open it.

01:25:18.697 --> 01:25:20.991
Money. Luke?

01:25:21.075 --> 01:25:23.702
I saw it when I was in
the grand high witch's room.

01:25:23.786 --> 01:25:25.287
I figured we could
really use it

01:25:25.371 --> 01:25:27.164
when we go to America.

01:25:28.958 --> 01:25:30.084
America?

01:25:30.167 --> 01:25:34.380
Yes. We've got to go
home because... look!

01:25:36.924 --> 01:25:39.176
It was
the grand high witch's.

01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:41.971
It has the name and address
of every witch in America.

01:25:48.352 --> 01:25:51.772
Luke.
You are a genius.

01:25:51.897 --> 01:25:53.774
Aw...

01:25:53.858 --> 01:25:54.859
Aw.

01:25:56.986 --> 01:26:01.991
<i>♪♪ It doesn't matter who
you are and what you are ♪♪</i>

01:26:02.116 --> 01:26:04.368
<i>♪♪ As long as somebody
loves you ♪♪</i>

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:08.455
Oh, Luke, what a day.

01:26:08.539 --> 01:26:10.916
Perhaps we could find
a good witch

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.335
to turn you back
into my grandson.

01:26:13.419 --> 01:26:16.755
I'll never be able to drive
a real car, will I, grandma?

01:26:16.839 --> 01:26:18.299
Oh, I don't know.

01:26:18.424 --> 01:26:20.467
How long do mice live,
grandma?

01:26:20.551 --> 01:26:24.471
I hope we have time to take on
those American witches.

01:26:25.097 --> 01:26:26.473
Can we go to New York?

01:26:26.557 --> 01:26:28.058
I've never been
to New York.

01:26:32.688 --> 01:26:34.440
Can we travel there
by ship?

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.734
First class.

01:26:36.817 --> 01:26:38.569
The best cabin.

01:26:38.652 --> 01:26:40.988
The best of everything.

01:26:44.116 --> 01:26:46.493
Good night, grandma.

01:26:47.036 --> 01:26:49.413
Good night, Luke.

01:27:00.758 --> 01:27:03.802
I really am happy
to be a mouse, you know.

01:27:05.262 --> 01:27:08.015
I know, my darling.

01:27:55.187 --> 01:27:56.689
Grandma!

01:27:56.772 --> 01:27:59.483
Grandma! Grandma,
what's happening?

01:28:03.487 --> 01:28:05.030
Luke!

01:28:16.166 --> 01:28:18.794
Luke!

01:28:35.978 --> 01:28:38.689
Oh!

01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:45.112
Off you go,
back home to Luke.

01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:50.534
Look, grandma!
They're back!

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.210
Don't forget Bruno!
