00:05.073 --> 00:08.309
- [Kaylie] Previously on
Make It or Break It:
- Everyone, meet Otis.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.111
It's a tradition
to rub his head for luck.

00:10.144 --> 00:11.779
Follow that girl, man,
she stole my phone!

00:11.812 --> 00:13.381
She stole my phone!

00:13.414 --> 00:16.450
- You used me.
- Welcome to the TC.

00:16.484 --> 00:19.320
I talked to Dr. Curtis,
she told me you have an
irregular heartbeat.

00:19.353 --> 00:22.223
You've got to stop her,
she can't do this.
You can't let her do this.

00:23.324 --> 00:24.258
I know you're
the mole here, Jordan.

00:24.292 --> 00:26.360
- [Kaylie] You're the mole?
- It was you?

00:26.394 --> 00:28.429
I am so sorry.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.166
[pop music]

00:48.116 --> 00:51.619
* You need me

00:51.652 --> 00:53.654
- Good.
- Thanks.

00:58.259 --> 01:02.230
All that time we thought Jordan
was the mole and she wasn't.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.631
Makes you feel a little icky,
doesn't it?

01:03.664 --> 01:05.333
I never accused her.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.403
To her face.
And neither did you.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.639
We judged her and that
makes us jerks.

01:15.343 --> 01:18.412
Damn. She is fierce.

01:18.446 --> 01:19.880
Like an angry pit bull.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.350
She could easily be a part
of the London Five.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.518
Don't you think we
need to make things right

01:24.552 --> 01:26.320
if we plan to be
on the same team as her?

01:27.555 --> 01:31.559
OK, you're right.
We should apologize.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.663
Hey, Jordan. Can we talk?

01:35.696 --> 01:37.565
[scoffs] About what?

01:37.598 --> 01:39.533
About the whole mole thing.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.535
Kaylie and I thought you were
the one ratting us out

01:41.569 --> 01:45.306
to the coach
and, um... we're sorry.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.242
Yeah, we're sorry.

01:48.276 --> 01:51.512
Well, it wouldn't be the first
time someone misjudged me.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.486
You see? There's no
getting through to her.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.721
- She's pretty hard-headed.
- Mm-hm.

02:02.490 --> 02:03.524
What?

02:04.525 --> 02:06.560
Right now Lauren is stuck
in a hospital bed

02:06.594 --> 02:08.696
hating me for
all of the wrong reasons.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.665
I would do anything
to prove to her that I was
just trying to help her,

02:11.699 --> 02:12.566
but she won't even see me.

02:12.600 --> 02:17.171
Wait, are you comparing
Lauren to Jordan?

02:17.205 --> 02:21.175
I'm just saying, maybe you
have the wrong idea about her,
that's all.

02:21.209 --> 02:24.578
Maybe you and Jordan are
still holding on to a grudge
from when you were 12.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.547
Payson, I know her, OK?

02:26.580 --> 02:27.415
I see what you're
trying to do here,

02:27.448 --> 02:30.284
but Jordan and I will
never be friends.

02:41.529 --> 02:44.365
Lauren, you have
a particularly rare form

02:44.398 --> 02:46.600
of supraventricular
tachycardia,

02:46.634 --> 02:47.868
a heart rhythm disorder.

02:47.901 --> 02:51.739
The best possible treatment for
your case is open heart surgery.

02:51.772 --> 02:56.644
Dr. Lim is one of the top
cardiac surgeons in the country,
Lauren.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.347
So, what happens now?

02:59.380 --> 03:02.416
I've arranged with the
training center officials

03:02.450 --> 03:04.752
for you to stay here at
the USATC Medical Center.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.488
In four days you will
go in for the surgery.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.591
In the meantime, the staff here
will monitor your condition

03:10.624 --> 03:12.426
and run a necessary
battery of tests

03:12.460 --> 03:13.761
in preparation
for the procedure.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.563
How soon can
I get back to training?

03:15.596 --> 03:18.266
I mean, I'm an athlete so I
should recover quickly, right?

03:22.270 --> 03:24.605
You're gonna need several months
of serious rest

03:24.638 --> 03:26.774
before you resume any
normal activities.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.609
Normal activities?

03:28.642 --> 03:32.380
I'm sorry, Lauren,
but there is no possibility

03:32.413 --> 03:35.516
of you returning to training
for the 2012 Games.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.253
This can't be happening.

03:39.287 --> 03:42.022
Dad, there's no other option?!

03:42.055 --> 03:45.393
I'm afraid not, Lauren.
We have to go with the
open heart surgery.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.594
It's for the best.

03:46.627 --> 03:50.398
How could that be for the best?
It couldn't be any worse!

03:50.431 --> 03:54.302
If my dream is dead,
I don't care about getting well!

04:00.574 --> 04:03.744
I went by the med center
to check in on Lauren and
I met her dad.

04:03.777 --> 04:07.047
Total sweetie. [sighs]
Poor Lauren, though.

04:07.080 --> 04:11.685
She's having open heart
surgery, so she's out.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.821
She has a heart?

04:13.854 --> 04:17.391
Funny! I am so lucky
to be rooming with you.

04:17.425 --> 04:20.694
I mean, if I was rooming
with Kaylie, ugh,
I'd never have any fun.

04:20.728 --> 04:21.695
[sarcastic] Whee.

04:21.729 --> 04:25.065
I mean, I like Kaylie but...

04:25.098 --> 04:26.667
...she's kind of
stuck on herself.

04:26.700 --> 04:27.501
Tell me about it.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.036
She's on top
of the ranking board,

04:29.069 --> 04:31.439
but it's beginning to eat
away at her, I can tell.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.807
She's getting all prissy
and up in her head about it.

04:33.841 --> 04:37.478
And, jeez, she really
has it out for you.

04:38.879 --> 04:39.813
Everyone thinks so.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.349
Probably because she thinks

04:41.382 --> 04:42.583
you're her biggest threat.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.319
You're turning into
Jordan the Amazo. [giggles]

04:45.353 --> 04:48.522
And Payson, well,
let's be honest...

04:49.890 --> 04:51.592
...she's not a threat
to anyone.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.861
Um, the bunny and I
are going out for some air.

04:53.894 --> 04:56.830
- Oh. Can I come with?
- No.

04:56.864 --> 05:00.501
- Oh. [nervous chuckle]
- [door closes]

05:01.902 --> 05:04.505
[up-tempo music]

05:26.927 --> 05:28.929
[crowd cheering]

05:34.935 --> 05:37.871
[Austin] I held my iron cross
for like an eternity today.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.640
It was awesome.
Feel that.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.842
- [Kaylie] Oh, pure iron, baby.
- [Austin grunts]

05:41.875 --> 05:43.911
And I'm gonna turn that iron
into gold in London.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.447
I know you will.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.716
So, we've got two days
until Eliminations.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.150
My rings are solid.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.853
I know my coach is gonna want
to show that off to the NGO.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.389
The only thing that needs work
is my floor

05:55.423 --> 05:57.825
but I can have that world
class just in time to shine.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.427
I'm getting nervous.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.462
Don't be. Everything's
falling into place

06:01.495 --> 06:03.497
just like it did four years ago.

06:03.531 --> 06:04.865
And I'm not the only
one who thinks so,

06:04.898 --> 06:06.600
a rep from
Puma called me today.

06:06.634 --> 06:07.901
What'd they say?

06:07.935 --> 06:09.937
We're playing phone tag.
But they wouldn't call me

06:09.970 --> 06:11.905
unless they thought I was going
to medal in London.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.941
- That's awesome!
- [siren approaching]

06:13.974 --> 06:15.909
What's up with that?

06:20.848 --> 06:21.849
What's wrong?
Is everybody OK?

06:21.882 --> 06:24.552
Everybody's fine.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.920
- Where was the fire, captain?
- It's a false alarm.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.689
Looks like a malfunction
in the system

06:28.722 --> 06:30.424
tripped the sprinklers
in that one pod.

06:30.458 --> 06:33.427
Weird. I was just
sitting there, reading

06:33.461 --> 06:34.895
and all of a sudden
it just started raining.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.564
Inside the room!

06:36.597 --> 06:39.199
It's soaked up there.
You got big time water damage,

06:39.232 --> 06:41.902
plus someone's gonna have to
come in and check the sensors
in that pod.

06:41.935 --> 06:45.973
So, you're gonna have to
move the girls out. Excuse me.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.910
Maybe we could move in
with Payson and Kaylie.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.713
Good call.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.915
Wendy, you'll move in
with Payson

06:54.948 --> 06:56.750
Jordan, you'll move in
with Kaylie.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.753
You got a problem
with that, Randall?

07:00.754 --> 07:01.889
No, sir.

07:06.894 --> 07:10.764
I tried to see Lauren, but
she wouldn't even let me up.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.766
I guess she's
still mad at me.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.536
She's, uh, pretty
overwhelmed right now.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.871
You gotta understand
what this has cost her.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.741
She's been forced to give up a
dream she's had her whole life.

07:23.010 --> 07:27.915
Listen, Mr. Tanner,
I'm so, so sorry.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.618
And I know that Lauren hates me
so much right now and...

07:30.651 --> 07:33.621
Thank you, Payson.

07:33.654 --> 07:34.655
Thank you?

07:39.026 --> 07:40.594
You saved my daughter's life.

07:40.628 --> 07:43.664
And I can't begin to tell you
how grateful I am.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.800
I know this hasn't been
easy for you.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.640
Lauren's only out of the program
pending disability.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.843
Are they sure she can't come
back to training in time to
make the team?

07:55.876 --> 08:00.648
When I injured my back, everyone
said there was no way I would
ever come back to the sport.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.916
I appreciate your concern,
but this is different.

08:02.950 --> 08:06.654
Lauren can't possibly recover
from this kind of surgery

08:06.687 --> 08:07.988
in time for the Olympics.

08:08.021 --> 08:11.058
There has to be another option.

08:11.091 --> 08:15.863
[sighs] The only other option
is a new, noninvasive procedure

08:15.896 --> 08:17.931
with a man named
Dr. Kevin Walker...

08:17.965 --> 08:20.701
Well, we should call him.
The sooner we talk to him,
the sooner...

08:20.734 --> 08:24.538
I have talked to Dr. Walker.
Just trust me.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.841
This procedure will not
work for Lauren.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.977
- Why?
- Because she's an athlete.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.079
Because she's an athlete?

08:32.112 --> 08:36.016
Dr. Walker will not perform
his procedure on a professional
athlete

08:36.049 --> 08:40.320
due to differences
in the heart brought on by the
stress of competitive training.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.089
But that should just
make her healthier.

08:42.122 --> 08:45.659
It makes her... different.

08:50.731 --> 08:54.001
Believe me, I wanted him to say
that he could help her too...

08:56.770 --> 08:59.339
...but he can't.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.008
That's the way it is.

09:02.776 --> 09:05.813
We have to accept the situation.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.589
- [sighs]
- Look, I know it's weird,

09:15.623 --> 09:18.626
but we can't share a room
and never speak.

09:18.659 --> 09:21.128
We don't have to play nice,
Kaylie. It's too exhausting.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.330
OK? We hate one another.
That's the way it is.

09:23.363 --> 09:26.066
[Kaylie] Is that a rodent you're
bringing in to live with us?

09:26.099 --> 09:29.637
It's a rabbit.
Do you have a problem
with that, Cruella De Vil?

09:37.077 --> 09:39.012
[knocking]

09:39.046 --> 09:41.081
Hey there, munchkin.

09:41.114 --> 09:44.017
I thought a visit from
an old friend might brighten
your day.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.720
It's... Jojo!

09:48.188 --> 09:50.123
Ah, come on,
you must remember him,

09:50.157 --> 09:53.126
he was your favorite
for... ever.

09:53.160 --> 09:57.030
Nice try,
but an old stuffed sock

09:57.064 --> 09:59.099
isn't going to
change anything, Dad.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.168
Well, I sort of figured that,

10:01.201 --> 10:06.073
so I brought someone else along
to lift your spirits.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.681
Hello, Lauren.

10:21.421 --> 10:24.658
The last time we emailed,
you were in Florida?

10:24.692 --> 10:26.794
I'm still there.
When your dad told me

10:26.827 --> 10:29.930
what was going on with you,
I came as quick as I could.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.866
Had to come see the pathetic
little invalid girl?

10:32.900 --> 10:35.803
- You are not an invalid.
- Might as well be.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.939
I know something that can help.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.208
I just... I don't feel like
praying, Summer.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.677
I just... I don't.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.078
I'm sorry, it just...

10:45.112 --> 10:47.080
I guess you came all
this way for nothing.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.720
I hope you don't mind
coming down here,

10:52.753 --> 10:54.822
I just don't want anyone
else to know about this yet.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.456
Oh, it's cool.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.791
I really don't want
to be back in the room

10:57.825 --> 10:59.860
- with Jordan, anyway.
- [chuckles]

10:59.893 --> 11:03.764
OK, so, what exactly is it
that we're supposed to be
looking for?

11:03.797 --> 11:06.099
Dr. Walker is known for his
groundbreaking techniques.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.869
He's a total outside-of-the-box
thinker.

11:08.902 --> 11:11.705
So, why wouldn't he
want to go outside the box

11:11.739 --> 11:13.874
and try this procedure
on a new kind of patient?

11:13.907 --> 11:16.009
But didn't Mr. Tanner
say they tried?

11:16.043 --> 11:18.445
Just not hard enough.

11:18.478 --> 11:19.612
He's got to hear it
from a gymnast,

11:19.646 --> 11:23.150
from someone who knows
what it's like to lose
everything.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.753
It's just so weird
that being an athlete

11:25.786 --> 11:27.988
is what's keeping Lauren
from being an Olympian.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.858
I think I can convince him to
try this procedure on Lauren.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.860
Wait. But I think
I got something.

11:32.893 --> 11:36.463
It's an article. Um, Dr. Walker
on Medicine and Meditation.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.798
Ah, bingo!

11:39.532 --> 11:42.903
It says he goes on
an annual retreat around
this time of year.

11:42.936 --> 11:45.005
They said he was on vacation
when I called his office.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.841
"The full media cleanse Walker
indulges in at the retreat

11:47.875 --> 11:50.310
enables him to do the work
that has made him the top
in his field."

11:51.879 --> 11:53.914
- Well, that's that.
- Why?

11:53.947 --> 11:57.885
Dr. Walker isn't gonna be
reading any emails.

11:57.918 --> 12:02.122
It says here they don't
allow any form of communication
technology in the retreat.

12:02.155 --> 12:05.893
- The retreat is
in the hills near Santa Fe.
- Yeah.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.295
That's, like, three
and a half hours away.

12:08.328 --> 12:11.098
- It's a sign.
- A sign of what?

12:11.131 --> 12:15.068
I have to go there.
I have to find Dr. Walker.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.338
[rock music]

12:32.953 --> 12:35.956
First off, your performance
since you've been here

12:35.989 --> 12:38.291
is beyond what I even
thought was possible.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.928
Well, I told you,
this is where I belong.

12:40.961 --> 12:46.066
Individually you're outstanding.
But that's not the issue.

12:46.099 --> 12:50.170
This is your profile from
our sports psychologist.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.940
"Jordan's largest challenge

12:52.973 --> 12:56.109
is in the area
of social interaction."

12:56.143 --> 12:58.345
OK, but if I'm already
achieving my goals

12:58.378 --> 13:00.280
then why do I need
to change anything?

13:01.949 --> 13:04.952
Because I'm building
a gold medal team.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.955
A lone wolf
never wins gold, Jordan.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.823
I put you in the same room
with Kaylie

13:09.857 --> 13:12.225
because I sense some
major tension there.

13:12.259 --> 13:15.228
It's time to work it out
and join the pack.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.212
Coach wanted me to pull the
iron cross from my routine.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.914
[scoffs] I said no way.

13:33.947 --> 13:36.383
You slipped out of it
and messed up your shoulder.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.985
You're lucky
you don't have a tear.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.587
I just pulled a muscle.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.956
I'm not losing
that iron cross.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.258
It's bad enough I slipped off
the rings in front of my coach

13:45.292 --> 13:47.027
and the whole team.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.929
I nix that move
and I look like a wuss.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.164
- [whimpers]
- Sorry, sorry.

13:53.233 --> 13:57.004
If I adjust my floor routine
to reduce impact,

13:57.037 --> 14:00.273
I can save my shoulder
for the cross.

14:00.307 --> 14:03.343
That's pure Tucker flash,
Kaylie, I'm not losing
that move.

14:03.376 --> 14:08.015
But you don't want to risk
your career on one trick.

14:08.048 --> 14:12.052
Perception is everything,
you know that.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.087
When you're the oldest guy on
the team, you can't look weak.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.289
OK, that's not even possible.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.292
But I have an idea.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.161
Why don't you come by
the women's gym tonight?

14:21.194 --> 14:23.430
I can take a look at your floor
routine and help you adjust it.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.165
You can figure it out
away from your coach

14:25.198 --> 14:27.000
and the rest of the team.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.069
Sounds like a plan.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.105
What would I
do without you?

14:32.139 --> 14:34.474
Luckily, you'll never
have to figure that out.

14:40.147 --> 14:43.150
So Coach is letting me out
because he thinks I have a
Healthy Bar promotional.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.451
So that's the story.

14:44.484 --> 14:47.354
OK, I'll cover for you
with the new roomies,

14:47.387 --> 14:49.189
but I really wish
I was going.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.925
Me too. I need you here
and so does Austin

14:51.959 --> 14:53.460
to help with
his Eliminations.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.929
'Sup, ladies.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.932
Thank you so much
for doing this.

14:58.966 --> 15:03.436
Yeah, I hate the idea of having
to go on a roadie with you,
Payson. Sucks.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.072
See you later.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.455
[sighs] You were right.

15:22.489 --> 15:25.125
We can't live together
and not talk to each other.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.193
And you're right.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.228
We can't pretend we're not mad
at each other either.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.496
[sighs]

15:29.529 --> 15:32.065
Then... I guess
we gotta get into it.

15:34.001 --> 15:36.169
I thought we were best friends
back at camp.

15:36.203 --> 15:39.339
Then all of a sudden,
Coach Keegan started
treating you as his pet

15:39.372 --> 15:40.473
and you kicked me
to the curb.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.075
Leave Keegan out of this.

15:42.109 --> 15:45.078
- Why? Because you
know it's true.
- What?

15:45.112 --> 15:46.146
I thought I could trust you.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.248
Then Keegan starting treating
you like his favorite.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.984
Your gymnastics took off
and you left me in the dust

15:51.018 --> 15:53.520
because you wanted to keep
Keegan for yourself.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.322
- You hurt me, Jordan.
- No, you hurt me.

15:55.355 --> 15:56.389
I hurt you?

15:56.423 --> 15:58.058
We had one stupid argument

15:58.091 --> 16:00.093
about whether or not you could
come with me and the coach

16:00.127 --> 16:03.030
to get some ice cream and then,
bam, you ran home to Boulder

16:03.063 --> 16:05.065
- and never looked back.
- That is not what happened.

16:05.098 --> 16:08.101
Oh, it's not? You had
your dad buy you a gym

16:08.135 --> 16:10.737
and a coach just so you would
never have to see me again.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.772
You didn't even say a word to me
after I won Junior Nationals.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.175
- I didn't know
you wanted me to.
- Well, I did!

16:19.079 --> 16:23.016
Look, I'm not the best at
showing people I need them

16:23.050 --> 16:25.052
because nobody ever seems
to need me.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.122
I never saw it that way.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.159
I should've known
you weren't the mole.

16:34.061 --> 16:36.096
You tell it like it is.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.298
You can be a pain in the butt,

16:38.331 --> 16:42.035
but you're not a sneak.
That is not your style.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.271
Thanks.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.307
I want you to know
that you can trust me.

16:48.575 --> 16:51.211
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

16:53.513 --> 16:57.517
Because I need somebody I can
trust right now, big time.

16:59.086 --> 17:02.222
Payson went on
a road trip with Rigo

17:02.255 --> 17:05.325
and I told her I would cover
for her until she got back.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.195
They went to find a doctor
for Lauren.

17:08.228 --> 17:11.098
But Wendy the blabbermouth
can not find out about this.

17:11.131 --> 17:15.402
If she tells McIntire,
Payson could be in big trouble.

17:15.435 --> 17:18.171
I could use
a partner in crime.

17:18.205 --> 17:21.608
- [door opens]
- Hey, roomies.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.813
Look...
No, I... I wouldn't...

17:26.846 --> 17:30.350
I wouldn't go in there
if I were you, 'cause Payson
is totally sick.

17:30.383 --> 17:35.088
Yeah. Yeah, um, she wanted
to get plenty of rest

17:35.122 --> 17:38.158
so that she'll be better for
her Healthy Bar event tomorrow.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.025
Yeah, we're gonna get out
of here

17:39.058 --> 17:42.129
so she can have
some peace and quiet.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.331
[whispering] Gotcha. We should
let her get some rest.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.266
- Yeah. So...
- Yeah.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.137
- Bye.
- [giggles]

17:50.170 --> 17:53.506
OK, so, um, I'll just sleep
in Payson's bed tonight,
under the blanket, so...

17:53.540 --> 17:57.377
I just won't come out from under
the covers until she's gone.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.680
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm. No biggie.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.517
[Lauren] You might as well
go back to Miami.

18:04.551 --> 18:07.154
I know I'm no fun
to be around.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.521
I'm not going anywhere, Lauren.

18:08.555 --> 18:12.259
But maybe it would be good
for you to get out of this
room for a bit.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.393
We could go take a walk.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.196
What? So you can trick me
into going to the chapel?

18:16.229 --> 18:18.331
I don't want to trick you
into anything, Lauren...

18:21.301 --> 18:25.338
...but I know you could only
benefit by asking God

18:25.372 --> 18:26.639
to help you with this.

18:26.673 --> 18:29.209
I'm through asking God
for things.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.278
Don't say that.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.413
Why?

18:33.446 --> 18:34.514
Why should I bother?

18:34.547 --> 18:37.217
I asked for my mom
to come back...

18:38.185 --> 18:39.919
...she's gone forever.

18:39.952 --> 18:43.256
I asked for you
to marry my dad. [chuckles]

18:43.290 --> 18:46.193
That didn't happen.

18:46.226 --> 18:49.529
And I've prayed
to be an Olympian
since I was six years old

18:49.562 --> 18:51.198
and this is how I ended up.

18:56.203 --> 18:58.205
It doesn't work that way,
Lauren.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.174
God's not Santa Claus.

19:01.208 --> 19:06.346
I'm tired of praying to
a God who never answers.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.182
"No" is an answer too.

19:09.216 --> 19:12.352
Please. Just leave me alone.

19:17.724 --> 19:21.561
I start my final run with a
round-off back handspring,

19:21.594 --> 19:23.463
whip into a
two-and-a-half twist.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.232
So I'm thinking
I can change that

19:25.265 --> 19:28.201
to a round-off, one-and-a-half
punch front full.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.736
Which will be easier
on my shoulder.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.338
What's the difference in DODs?

19:31.371 --> 19:33.340
The degree of difficulty
is the same.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.608
- Oh.
- But the two-and-a-half
is a lot flashier.

19:35.642 --> 19:38.245
But you want to preserve your
iron cross, right?

19:38.278 --> 19:40.380
Pure Tucker flash.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.315
Strain your shoulder
doing the two-and-a-half

19:42.349 --> 19:43.750
and you could ruin
the best trick you have.

19:43.783 --> 19:47.387
Then there's my answer.
I'll do the one and a half.

19:48.321 --> 19:52.292
All right, Tucker.
Let's see it.

19:52.325 --> 19:55.295
Gold Medalist Austin Tucker
takes the floor

19:55.328 --> 19:57.364
and the crowd goes wild!

20:07.307 --> 20:09.809
Nice. You're gonna
nail it tomorrow.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.280
There's something
I want to give you.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.289
To inspire you.

20:23.523 --> 20:24.791
It's a page from my journal.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.627
[Austin] "I told Austin
I loved him today.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.629
I thought it was
going to be scary,

20:29.662 --> 20:31.698
but it was wonderful.
Just like him!"

20:34.834 --> 20:37.670
I love you too, Kaylie Cruz.

20:37.704 --> 20:40.307
And there's nothing
scary about that.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.319
[motorcycle revving]

20:58.057 --> 21:00.793
So it looks like the retreat
is about an hour away.

21:00.827 --> 21:03.430
So in the a.m. we get up...

21:03.463 --> 21:05.432
We go to the camp
and find Dr. Walker.

21:05.465 --> 21:08.801
So, how exactly are you planning
on changing his mind?

21:09.869 --> 21:11.571
I don't know.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.307
I just think if he's known for
pioneering surgical techniques

21:14.341 --> 21:17.444
to help people, how can he
draw the line at athletes?

21:17.477 --> 21:19.346
He has to say yes.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.814
How could anyone
say no to you?

21:21.848 --> 21:23.850
Ahh, you are freezing.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.319
Here, let me go get you
my jacket, it's warmer.

21:26.353 --> 21:27.654
No, no, 'cause then
you'll be freezing.

21:27.687 --> 21:30.390
I'll be fine as once I get
in the sleeping bag.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.858
Yeah, I was thinking,

21:31.891 --> 21:34.427
what if we zipped our two
sleeping bags together

21:34.461 --> 21:36.496
and then made one
big one. That way we...

21:36.529 --> 21:39.599
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on a minute, mister.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.402
We're not on a pleasure trip.
We're on a mission of mercy.

21:42.435 --> 21:45.638
Look, I promise to be
on my best behavior.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.640
But if it makes you
uncomfortable

21:47.674 --> 21:51.411
with our shared sleeping
arrangements, I understand.

21:51.444 --> 21:55.415
It's not that I don't want to.
It's just that I...

21:55.448 --> 21:57.484
- I'm a...
- Oh.

21:57.517 --> 21:58.551
You're a...

21:59.519 --> 22:01.821
I'm a virgin. Yeah.

22:02.655 --> 22:03.756
I respect that.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.392
I sort of made
this promise to myself

22:05.425 --> 22:07.527
a long time ago that
I would wait until...

22:07.560 --> 22:09.462
Till we got married.

22:09.496 --> 22:13.400
Uh, I mean you.
Till you got married?

22:13.433 --> 22:15.502
- Uh.
- Not exactly.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.670
I made a promise that I would
wait until I won the gold.

22:17.704 --> 22:20.106
Well, I think
that's really cool.

22:20.139 --> 22:22.442
That means you take sex
seriously.

22:22.475 --> 22:25.845
And I mean, no one takes it
seriously anymore.

22:25.878 --> 22:29.549
Sex should be... safe...
and loving...

22:29.582 --> 22:32.519
...and definitely something
you both agree on.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.521
And if it makes you
more comfortable,

22:34.554 --> 22:37.390
I am more than willing to
let you have that tent tonight
to yourself.

22:37.424 --> 22:41.661
Don't be ridiculous,
it's like ice out here.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.930
I would be honored not only
to share the tent with you,

22:43.963 --> 22:47.500
but also our sleeping bag.

22:48.435 --> 22:49.436
Hm.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.439
[giggles]

22:55.575 --> 22:57.477
[birds chirping]

23:01.213 --> 23:03.750
[groans]

23:03.783 --> 23:05.652
- Morning.
- Morning.

23:05.685 --> 23:06.619
How did you sleep?

23:06.653 --> 23:09.956
Perfectly. But you do
snore just a little bit.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.791
So I've been told.

23:11.824 --> 23:14.427
By my roommates, OK?

23:25.705 --> 23:29.442
So, ready to get back
out on the road,

23:29.476 --> 23:30.977
find the miracle man?

23:31.010 --> 23:33.446
Yeah, I just don't know
what I'm gonna say

23:33.480 --> 23:34.714
to him once we find him.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.949
You'll get through to him,
I have faith in you.

23:36.983 --> 23:40.186
But I want him to have faith in
himself. That he can do this.

23:40.219 --> 23:41.721
Then, that's what you say.

23:48.961 --> 23:50.029
[Wendy] Pay-Pay?

23:52.031 --> 23:55.201
Payson, how are you feeling?

23:55.234 --> 23:57.504
[groaning]

23:57.537 --> 23:59.639
Still sick, huh?

23:59.672 --> 24:02.742
Too bad you're gonna show up
to your Healthy Bar thing
totally barfo.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.845
But you'll rock it to the max
because you're Payson the Amazo.

24:05.878 --> 24:08.581
[giggles, sighs]

24:08.615 --> 24:10.850
You're, like, totally
going to London.

24:12.251 --> 24:15.755
But Jordan? Totes wacko.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.525
Poor thing, she's definitely
gonna flame out.

24:21.260 --> 24:25.498
Let's be honest. She's just
Coach McIntire's charity case.

24:25.532 --> 24:28.635
Anyway, Pay-Pay, feel better!

24:42.949 --> 24:44.984
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.656
Lauren's in a very
dark place, Steve.

24:49.689 --> 24:52.525
She feels like God's
turned his back on her.

24:52.559 --> 24:55.061
I hope you told her
that wasn't true.

24:55.094 --> 24:58.965
Well, I tried but, she
couldn't hear it from me.

25:00.299 --> 25:02.702
But you've shared
her Olympic dreams, Steve.

25:02.735 --> 25:06.072
That's why she needs to hear
you say it's going to be OK.

25:06.105 --> 25:09.008
I've spent so many years
building our lives

25:09.041 --> 25:11.711
around her dreams
of winning gold.

25:14.113 --> 25:17.684
How do I tell her that
doesn't matter anymore?

25:24.724 --> 25:26.092
- You nailed it?
- Of course.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.560
- Yes!
- [laughs]

25:29.696 --> 25:31.097
My floor was flawless
with that one and a half.

25:31.130 --> 25:33.900
Clean and mean
from start to finish,

25:33.933 --> 25:35.034
and they didn't
even ask to see my rings.

25:35.067 --> 25:36.035
Why should they?

25:36.068 --> 25:38.838
They know Austin Tucker
is King of the Rings.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.574
- And a Puma rep just called...
- With an offer?

25:41.608 --> 25:43.710
They have their eye on a
Tucker-Cruz golden couple
thing...

25:43.743 --> 25:46.312
- What?
- ...but I told them I don't
mix business with pleasure.

25:46.345 --> 25:48.014
They'll need to
take a number anyway.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.583
After London I'll be
writing my own ticket.

25:50.617 --> 25:53.119
When does the list go up?
I'm ready for an official
celebration.

25:53.152 --> 25:54.887
Four p.m. sharp.

25:56.656 --> 25:58.758
Oh, OK,
I gotta get back to work.

25:58.791 --> 26:01.127
But I'll be waiting for you
outside the men's gym.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.762
Bye.

26:05.164 --> 26:08.167
[monitor beeping]

26:14.941 --> 26:18.845
Jake? What are you doing here?
This some horrible nightmare?

26:18.878 --> 26:21.848
I heard you were having surgery
and I thought you could use some
luck.

26:24.651 --> 26:27.654
If that is a giant Barbie
in a hospital gown,

26:27.687 --> 26:30.156
I will call security.
I'm not in the mood.

26:32.759 --> 26:35.662
Really! You're giving
Otis to me.

26:35.695 --> 26:36.896
Not for keeps.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.364
Just one head rub
and he's back home

26:38.397 --> 26:40.667
with the wrestlers
where he belongs.

26:41.801 --> 26:42.935
And you're welcome.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.804
But if a bunch of
crazy gymnasts pop out

26:44.837 --> 26:47.373
and try to steal him
I swear I will take the
whole squad down.

26:47.406 --> 26:49.876
Don't call us a squad,
we're not cheerleaders.

26:51.210 --> 26:54.213
Take your rub, gym-bot,
before I change my mind.

27:30.783 --> 27:33.452
Welcome. Do you have
a reservation?

27:33.485 --> 27:37.089
No, I just need to speak to one
of your guests. A Dr. Walker?

27:37.123 --> 27:38.457
I'm sorry, but that
is not possible.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.059
Oh, well then he is here!

27:40.092 --> 27:42.695
Listen, I know that
this is a spiritual place

27:42.729 --> 27:44.931
and I promise this
will only take a second.

27:44.964 --> 27:48.234
The people who come here make
a significant time and financial
investment

27:48.267 --> 27:50.069
to be protected from
the outside world.

27:50.102 --> 27:52.705
But couldn't you just
call his room

27:52.739 --> 27:53.840
and tell him
he has a visitor?

27:53.873 --> 27:56.976
First, there are no rooms.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.444
The guests sleep in yurts.

27:58.477 --> 27:59.946
Second, there are no phones
on the grounds.

27:59.979 --> 28:03.850
We don't even allow private
computers or cell phones on
the premises.

28:03.883 --> 28:07.119
And there are no visitors
accepted under any
circumstances.

28:07.153 --> 28:08.888
She just needs a second.

28:08.921 --> 28:10.957
Even if I could let you in,
you couldn't talk to him.

28:10.990 --> 28:13.726
There is no speaking
inside this gate.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.695
We get it. You want
silence or whatever.

28:17.897 --> 28:19.766
But we've come so far!

28:26.773 --> 28:28.841
I did not come this far
to be turned away.

28:28.875 --> 28:30.910
And if he says no,
do we burn the place down?

28:30.943 --> 28:33.112
- He is not going to say no.
- I hope you're right.

28:33.145 --> 28:35.147
I know I'm right. You ready?

28:35.181 --> 28:36.949
Aye-aye, Commander Payson.

28:36.983 --> 28:40.953
OK, so just keep your hands on
the wall just like I showed you.

28:40.987 --> 28:43.289
Make sure to keep your back
flat so you absorb the impact
with your thighs.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.925
[* Ben Rector: "You And Me"]

28:45.958 --> 28:47.259
This is insane, you know that?

28:47.293 --> 28:49.962
Uh-huh. Ready. Set...

28:49.996 --> 28:52.865
* It's been a real long time
since I seen you girl *

28:55.301 --> 28:58.938
* It's been a real long time
in another world *

29:00.973 --> 29:04.043
* Well I got scars to prove
that I don't need you *

29:04.076 --> 29:07.780
* But the heart knows
that I always do *

29:12.819 --> 29:16.823
* 'Cause you and me

29:18.357 --> 29:21.861
* Could never be

29:23.963 --> 29:28.300
* We're forever leaving

29:28.334 --> 29:32.138
* You and me *

29:59.999 --> 30:04.837
You know I love you
unconditionally, right?

30:06.005 --> 30:08.975
I know, Daddy.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.977
But I want you
to be proud of me.

30:11.010 --> 30:15.414
I am proud of you, Lauren.
And nothing's gonna change that.

30:17.984 --> 30:19.385
How is it possible
to be proud of me

30:19.418 --> 30:23.255
if I lose everything
we fought so hard for?

30:26.425 --> 30:29.028
You didn't lose anything.

30:29.061 --> 30:33.900
In my book you're becoming
a bigger winner than ever.

30:33.933 --> 30:39.872
And you don't need the Olympics
to earn my love and respect.

30:39.906 --> 30:43.275
I have always loved you
and I always will.

30:43.309 --> 30:48.280
[gasps] I just feel like
I'm letting you down.

30:48.314 --> 30:52.418
And I know it's not my fault
but it just feels like it is.

30:52.451 --> 30:55.254
This is...
This is nobody's fault.

30:55.287 --> 30:59.058
It's just how life is
sometimes.

30:59.091 --> 31:01.027
It... It knocks you back
on your heels,

31:01.060 --> 31:04.964
and you... you just gotta
keep on fighting.

31:04.997 --> 31:07.033
And I... I know we're gonna...

31:07.066 --> 31:09.635
We're gonna get through this
and be the better for it.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.437
I have no doubt
about that

31:11.470 --> 31:15.074
because we're in this
together, honey,

31:15.107 --> 31:19.011
just like everything
else we've come through.

31:21.013 --> 31:22.214
Hey.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.485
Who are we?

31:29.088 --> 31:30.189
Team Tanner.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.458
That's right.

31:32.491 --> 31:35.461
And Team Tanner
isn't going anywhere.

31:38.130 --> 31:40.967
We'll just...
We'll just find a new adventure.

31:43.135 --> 31:44.903
I love you, Dad.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.264
Dr. Walker?

32:19.405 --> 32:21.107
I know you're here
for peace

32:21.140 --> 32:23.375
and I don't mean to
disturb that for you but...

32:23.409 --> 32:26.178
...my friend, Lauren Tanner,
desperately needs your help.

32:28.147 --> 32:31.117
She's scheduled for
open heart surgery tomorrow,

32:31.150 --> 32:34.086
which would ruin
her chances of
going to the Olympics.

32:34.120 --> 32:37.256
I know you said that she's
not a candidate for your
procedure,

32:37.289 --> 32:40.526
but I also know that
you've never tried your
procedure on an athlete.

32:40.559 --> 32:44.396
So, how can you be so sure
that it won't work?

32:44.430 --> 32:47.399
I'm begging you. Please,
please just come examine her.

32:47.433 --> 32:49.135
It would be a life-changer
for her.

32:49.168 --> 32:51.003
Please.

32:55.207 --> 32:58.144
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

32:58.177 --> 32:59.311
This is uncharted territory.

32:59.345 --> 33:02.048
An athlete's heart
is very different
from a normal heart.

33:02.081 --> 33:03.282
How can it be that different?

33:03.315 --> 33:06.785
The constant stress on
the cardio vascular system

33:06.818 --> 33:10.089
generally causes
an enlarging of the left
ventricular wall of the heart.

33:10.122 --> 33:13.192
That means, as an athlete,

33:13.225 --> 33:15.361
your friend is at risk
for all kinds of complications.

33:15.394 --> 33:18.297
I know you want
her to be well, clearly,

33:18.330 --> 33:21.167
there's absolutely
no guarantee this
procedure will work for her.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.202
Then there's no guarantee
that it won't work for her.

33:23.235 --> 33:26.172
What's so bad about expanding
your pool of candidates?

33:26.205 --> 33:28.174
Are you that concerned
with ruining your average?

33:28.207 --> 33:30.176
'Cause that doesn't
sound very doctor-ly.

33:30.209 --> 33:33.779
My reputation and her life
are at stake.

33:33.812 --> 33:35.514
It's just not worth
the risk involved.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.416
I'm sorry,
but my answer is no.

33:51.397 --> 33:54.366
I read all about you
on the Internet

33:54.400 --> 33:59.471
and you seemed like
such an amazing, amazing man.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.140
And maybe you are.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.576
But I just thought
that you would be braver.

34:06.578 --> 34:09.815
Apparently, I have more faith in
you than you have in yourself.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.650
[man] I'll have to ask you
to leave now.

34:47.219 --> 34:48.554
I need you...

34:51.190 --> 34:53.192
...to help me find a way...

34:54.360 --> 34:56.228
...to accept this.

35:02.501 --> 35:05.571
[chuckles, sniffs]

35:11.710 --> 35:13.545
I can't believe he said no.

35:13.579 --> 35:15.281
But he did.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.449
I'm just lucky I didn't
get arrested for trespassing.

35:18.917 --> 35:20.319
You know, when you were
inside the retreat,

35:20.352 --> 35:23.289
I kept looking at the sign
over the entrance.

35:23.322 --> 35:27.493
It said, "In the silence,
the universe answers."

35:27.526 --> 35:30.529
And the universe answered "no".

35:31.597 --> 35:33.532
Maybe the answer
is that things

35:33.565 --> 35:36.168
don't always work out
the way we want them to.

35:36.202 --> 35:39.305
But we have to trust
that everything

35:39.338 --> 35:40.906
is going to be OK
in the end.

35:40.939 --> 35:45.377
I'd like to think that.
It's just...

35:45.411 --> 35:47.346
It's hard, you know?

35:47.379 --> 35:49.181
I stink.

35:49.215 --> 35:51.217
Are you kidding?
You're wonderful.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.551
No, I mean like literally.

35:52.584 --> 35:55.187
We've been traveling
for over 24 hours,

35:55.221 --> 35:56.922
so I gotta go to my room
and clean up.

35:56.955 --> 35:58.490
All right, I'll see ya later.

35:59.425 --> 36:00.426
Mm.

36:03.495 --> 36:06.265
- [door opens]
- He's a good guy.

36:06.298 --> 36:07.666
- [door closes]
- He's perfect.

36:09.235 --> 36:11.603
So? Last night?

36:11.637 --> 36:14.606
Alone in the tent?
Anything happen?

36:14.640 --> 36:16.608
Yes.

36:16.642 --> 36:17.943
You did the deed!?

36:17.976 --> 36:19.711
No.

36:19.745 --> 36:22.214
I fell in love.

36:22.248 --> 36:25.551
He was such a gentleman,
it was so romantic.

36:25.584 --> 36:27.953
- I wish we had.
- He still has the tent.

36:27.986 --> 36:31.189
- [laughing]
- [knocking]

36:34.526 --> 36:36.428
Mr. Tanner.

36:36.462 --> 36:38.230
Hey, Payson. Hi, Kaylie.

36:38.264 --> 36:41.400
I, uh, just came by
to see if you were free

36:41.433 --> 36:42.768
to come to the med center.

36:42.801 --> 36:45.337
Lauren would really
like to see you.

36:51.543 --> 36:52.778
Austin?

36:52.811 --> 36:54.280
What happened?

36:54.313 --> 36:56.348
I'm out, Kaylie.

36:56.382 --> 36:59.585
What? I... I don't...
I don't believe that.

36:59.618 --> 37:01.653
Believe it. I'm off the team.

37:01.687 --> 37:03.789
I took your advice
and now I'm out.

37:05.424 --> 37:07.993
How could I make the team with
a one-and-a-half in that run?

37:08.026 --> 37:10.762
- You said it looked great.
- It did. I swear.

37:10.796 --> 37:14.333
Probably because it's beneath
every other guy here.

37:14.366 --> 37:17.403
I came off looking
old and pathetic.

37:17.436 --> 37:20.372
And they didn't even ask
to see my rings.

37:20.406 --> 37:22.808
All that work
protecting my best trick.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.410
They didn't even see it.

37:24.443 --> 37:25.744
So, London?
Out.

37:25.777 --> 37:28.814
My chance at a second
gold medal? Gone.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.749
I was banking
everything on that

37:30.782 --> 37:33.685
and now, thanks to you,
I've lost everything.

37:33.719 --> 37:37.323
Austin. Don't say that.
I've only tried to support you.

37:37.356 --> 37:38.690
You've done nothing
but drag me down

37:38.724 --> 37:41.327
ever since I freaking fell
for you and lost myself.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.296
- That's not true.
- Our whole thing, Kaylie.

37:44.330 --> 37:46.698
It's ruined my focus.
Seriously.

37:46.732 --> 37:50.369
It's obviously why I couldn't
train hard enough to get
to London.

37:50.402 --> 37:52.070
How can you blame this on me?

37:52.103 --> 37:55.707
Because I had my life together
before you.

37:55.741 --> 37:58.710
But now,
I don't even know who I am.

37:58.744 --> 38:00.312
I had major endorsements.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.348
Now, nobody even wants
to do business with me

38:02.381 --> 38:04.383
unless I can get them
a meeting with you.

38:06.852 --> 38:08.654
Guess what?

38:08.687 --> 38:11.357
I have no interest in being
Mr. Kaylie Cruz.

38:30.576 --> 38:35.581
O.M.G. [giggles]

38:35.614 --> 38:38.417
I was just going over
to go see the men's
Elimination results.

38:38.450 --> 38:41.487
You know, kinda play
cheerleaders for the winners.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.822
- And there they were.
- Who?

38:43.855 --> 38:48.527
Austin and Kaylie.
I couldn't help overhearing.

38:48.560 --> 38:52.398
He didn't make the cut
and then he totally blamed her.

38:52.431 --> 38:54.400
Isn't that trag?

38:54.433 --> 38:56.902
This is the kind of thing
that jacks your focus, big time.

38:56.935 --> 38:59.371
Good thing we don't have
any boyfriends to mess
with our heads.

38:59.405 --> 39:01.807
Boys are just gold blockers.

39:01.840 --> 39:06.845
[sighs] Poor Kaylie,
I'm so-o-o-o worried about her.

39:06.878 --> 39:08.914
- She's totally gonna...
- Stop!

39:08.947 --> 39:10.549
You gotta quit
talking smack, Wendy.

39:10.582 --> 39:12.651
'Cause pretty soon
it's gonna get around

39:12.684 --> 39:14.386
that you slam
everyone behind their backs

39:14.420 --> 39:15.921
and no one's gonna trust you.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.789
No one is going to London alone.

39:17.823 --> 39:19.425
OK? We're all part of a team,

39:19.458 --> 39:21.693
so stop acting like a
punk and grow up already.

39:23.161 --> 39:24.362
Damn.

39:30.969 --> 39:34.606
Hey. I wanted to
come visit but...

39:34.640 --> 39:36.775
I know. I've been a jerk.

39:36.808 --> 39:39.745
No. No, you're dealing
with a lot.

39:39.778 --> 39:43.415
But I took it out on you
and that was wrong.

39:43.449 --> 39:47.419
I blamed you unfairly, Pay.
I'm sorry.

39:52.458 --> 39:58.163
Look, Lauren, I feel as though
we've become good, good friends

39:58.196 --> 40:00.466
in the past few months.

40:00.499 --> 40:03.435
And I'm not willing to
give up on that so easily.

40:03.469 --> 40:05.571
I can be pretty stubborn
when I commit to something.

40:05.604 --> 40:08.474
Really? I hadn't noticed.

40:10.509 --> 40:15.647
Lauren, I'm a hundred
percent here for you,

40:15.681 --> 40:16.815
no matter what.

40:16.848 --> 40:21.587
I hate the sound of that,
"no matter what."

40:21.620 --> 40:23.589
- I'm sorry.
- No.

40:24.623 --> 40:26.858
It's something
I have to face.

40:26.892 --> 40:31.463
There are things that are
beyond my control.

40:31.497 --> 40:35.634
I have to accept them.
No matter what.

40:35.667 --> 40:38.737
And I guess I can be
kind of a control freak, too.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.972
Ya think?

40:41.006 --> 40:44.843
Sometimes you
have to let go...

40:46.778 --> 40:51.483
...and trust that
it's gonna be OK in the end.

40:51.517 --> 40:54.052
- [knocking]
- Knock, Knock.

40:58.590 --> 41:00.025
Dr. Walker, you came!

41:00.058 --> 41:01.860
Lauren, this is Dr. Walker.

41:01.893 --> 41:04.963
He's the specialist
we've been talking about.

41:04.996 --> 41:07.899
What are you doing here?
I thought I wasn't a candidate.

41:07.933 --> 41:10.769
I can't guarantee that you are.

41:10.802 --> 41:14.873
But Dr. Walker agreed
to examine you and consider
your case.

41:14.906 --> 41:16.875
And from what
he's been telling us,

41:16.908 --> 41:18.577
it's all thanks to Payson.

41:18.610 --> 41:20.779
What is going on?

41:20.812 --> 41:25.584
Um... I wanted to help you,
so Rigo and I...

41:25.617 --> 41:28.253
It's a long story, I'll tell
you all about it later.

41:28.286 --> 41:30.589
What changed your mind?

41:30.622 --> 41:34.560
The, um... The retreat where
you found me, has a mantra.

41:34.593 --> 41:35.894
Do you know what it is?

41:35.927 --> 41:39.598
"In silence
the universe answers?"

41:39.631 --> 41:41.767
There's more to it.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.935
"In silence
the universe answers,

41:43.969 --> 41:47.639
in our hearts we find the
bravery to go where it's
calling us to go."

41:47.673 --> 41:49.808
You're a child of the universe,
you asked me to listen,

41:49.841 --> 41:52.544
I heard you, I just needed
to find the courage

41:52.578 --> 41:54.746
to go where you were
asking me to.

41:54.780 --> 41:56.548
[* Billy Currington:

42:58.877 --> 43:01.179
I'm so lucky I found
someone like you.

43:02.814 --> 43:04.750
I feel just as lucky.

43:04.783 --> 43:07.786

Are you sure
you want to do this?

43:18.697 --> 43:22.634
Shh. Just listen
to the universe.

43:24.102 --> 43:27.372
* I need you

43:27.405 --> 43:30.676
