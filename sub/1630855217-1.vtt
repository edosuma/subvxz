WEBVTT

00:28.419 --> 00:29.899
So, Daisy Bea.

00:30.856 --> 00:31.944
Anything bothering you?

00:32.945 --> 00:34.295
Out of the ordinary?

00:34.469 --> 00:36.732
- Mm. Nope.
- Good.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.778
- And how's Camille doing?
- Uh...

00:40.257 --> 00:43.173
- She's Camille.
- Yeah.

00:44.131 --> 00:46.568
We all just love her here.
A wonderful lady.

00:47.351 --> 00:48.570
Now there's
a bit of pressure here.

00:51.442 --> 00:53.923
Now, Daisy,
still no children, huh?

00:54.576 --> 00:55.794
Not that I'm aware of.

00:57.492 --> 00:58.928
Seriously, though, no kids.

00:59.450 --> 01:01.061
Is that something that you're...

01:02.192 --> 01:04.020
Well, is that something
that you're planning on?

01:04.194 --> 01:06.327
Yeah. Absolutely.
One day. Always have.

01:06.501 --> 01:08.720
Excited about kids.
I just don't want to rush it.

01:09.547 --> 01:12.159
Now, Daisy, I don't want
to sound insensitive here,

01:12.333 --> 01:13.377
but one day...

01:15.118 --> 01:17.686
This is one of those
"Now or never" type situations.

01:17.860 --> 01:19.209
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:19.383 --> 01:21.081
- Now or never?
- Yeah.

01:21.255 --> 01:23.344
I don't want to startle you
or anything, but...

01:24.258 --> 01:26.912
...another year or so
and, well...

01:28.044 --> 01:29.872
...it'll just get
harder and harder.

01:30.046 --> 01:32.614
Now it says here that you're
still on birth control, right?

01:32.788 --> 01:35.312
- Yeah.
- That's another hurdle.

01:35.486 --> 01:38.141
You don't just have the age
working against you, but the hormonal imbalance.

01:38.315 --> 01:39.969
What's with all the age talk?

01:40.143 --> 01:41.840
If your birthday
is correct here,

01:42.624 --> 01:44.843
it says to me
that you're not thirty.

01:45.017 --> 01:46.497
Well, I'm in my thirties.
So there's that.

01:46.671 --> 01:47.933
Almost 40?

01:48.586 --> 01:51.067
Right. No. Sure.
Yeah. I know that.

01:51.850 --> 01:52.938
Okay, great.

01:53.591 --> 01:55.027
Then we're on the same page.

01:55.202 --> 01:57.291
Absolutely. Same page.

01:57.465 --> 01:59.075
May want to get
that ball rolling.

02:05.864 --> 02:09.172
<i>- ♪ Put down your guitar, man
You're using it wrong ♪</i> -

02:09.346 --> 02:11.261
<i>♪ Can't make that feeling
you need come back... ♪</i>

02:13.655 --> 02:15.004
<i>♪ ...out on loan ♪</i>

02:19.182 --> 02:20.705

02:20.879 --> 02:23.752

02:26.189 --> 02:29.192
- It's Friday already?
- The one day of the month

02:29.366 --> 02:31.455
that they don't all have
their faces all shoved in their phones.

02:31.629 --> 02:34.415
- Rally! Rally!
- Hey, come on.

02:34.589 --> 02:37.287
Come on, guys. This is a place
of study and focus.

02:37.461 --> 02:38.984
No one cares.

02:40.899 --> 02:44.425
Not to be the bearer
of bad news, but no one cares about you.

02:44.599 --> 02:45.948
That's not true. I do.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.863
Aw. That's just too cute, Daisy.

02:48.037 --> 02:48.994
Hey.

02:57.568 --> 02:59.875
I'll give it back to you when
you learn to call me Miss Bea.

03:00.049 --> 03:01.355
I'm a teacher
and you're a student.

03:01.529 --> 03:02.443
Learn a bit of respect.

03:02.617 --> 03:04.096
You're not a teacher.

03:04.271 --> 03:07.143
You're a, whatever,
librarian, Miss Bea.

03:08.231 --> 03:09.754
Can have it back now?

03:09.928 --> 03:11.582
It'll be in the counselor's
office after school.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.889
Come on, Sadie. Let's go.

03:19.329 --> 03:21.070
So rude.

03:27.424 --> 03:30.079
Oh, uh,
your <i>art du jour</i> project.

03:30.253 --> 03:31.950
Oh, I always love these.

03:32.124 --> 03:33.822
So what's the latest passion
in the class today?

03:33.996 --> 03:36.216
We are rounding out
our scratch art projects.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.696
Pretty much my favorite form.
It takes a steady hand.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.350
Oh. Cool. You have fun.

03:55.409 --> 03:58.368
So, how's everything
with Stephen?

03:58.542 --> 04:01.545
- It's good.
- That sounds like a dream relationship.

04:01.719 --> 04:04.156
Well, he keeps, you know,
laying down these little "Let's take it slow"

04:04.331 --> 04:06.158
or "Let's go with the flow"
type jabs. - You should break up with him.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.901
- No, I can't. Just moved in.
- I'm kidding. Wow.

04:10.075 --> 04:12.208
Not even a thought.
That's impressive.

04:12.382 --> 04:15.559
Well, he loves horses, and, you
know, horses are my weakness.

04:15.733 --> 04:19.650
I think cruising along with
the status quo is your weakness. - Ouch.

04:19.824 --> 04:21.652
I'm just saying,
if you want different outputs,

04:21.826 --> 04:23.872
you need to try
different inputs.

04:24.046 --> 04:25.569
- You know what I'm saying?
- Mm.

04:25.743 --> 04:27.049
Inputs?

04:28.964 --> 04:30.531
You never want to settle down?

04:31.575 --> 04:33.273
We're still so young, Daze.

04:34.186 --> 04:35.797
Well, that's not what
I've been hearing lately.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.321
All this talk
about settling down

04:38.495 --> 04:42.325
comes from this generation
who graduated high school,

04:42.499 --> 04:43.718
got married and...

04:43.892 --> 04:45.372
oozed out children.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.983
Your mother.
The world is different now.

04:48.157 --> 04:50.420
Sure, but biology does not care
if the world is different.

04:51.029 --> 04:53.902
Believe whatever you want
to believe, and I will be here to support you.

04:55.120 --> 04:55.947
You gotta teach?

04:56.121 --> 04:57.340
Yep. I got jazz.

04:57.514 --> 04:58.646
You should come sometime.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.866
- I'll think about it.
- I love you.

05:02.040 --> 05:02.911
I love you.

05:04.869 --> 05:05.914
Hm.

05:21.756 --> 05:23.105
Hey, do you need a hand?

05:23.279 --> 05:25.368
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, awesome.

05:25.977 --> 05:26.804
Oh!

05:41.732 --> 05:43.343
Oh.

05:43.517 --> 05:45.649
You're so lucky to get
to babysit this little prince.

05:45.823 --> 05:47.608
Oh, no, he's mine.

05:47.782 --> 05:48.696
Thanks so much.

05:56.225 --> 05:58.793
Oh, sorry. Bye.

06:00.011 --> 06:01.012
Bye.

06:12.546 --> 06:14.286
- Hey, darling.
- Frank!

06:14.983 --> 06:16.376
- Frank dear.
- How's the--

06:16.941 --> 06:19.117
How's the library?
You need anything?

06:19.291 --> 06:21.032
- No, it's great.
- Frank!

06:22.251 --> 06:23.992
How's the office?

06:24.166 --> 06:25.994
Mm. Stressful.

06:26.168 --> 06:27.604
- Hence the beer.
- Mm.

06:27.778 --> 06:30.346
I guess I have a husband
who's hard of hearing.

06:30.520 --> 06:31.434
Camille. Hello, dear.

06:32.522 --> 06:33.828
You staying for dinner, Daze?

06:34.002 --> 06:35.873
She's going
to the cowboy's house.

06:36.744 --> 06:37.701
That's where I live.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.921
Sort of. A lot of stuff here.

06:40.095 --> 06:41.575
So how is it over there, anyway?

06:41.749 --> 06:44.099
How's Stephen?
I haven't seen him in ages.

06:44.665 --> 06:46.231
Yeah, I know.
I'm working on that.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.496
Oh, Daisy, don't make any plans
for tomorrow night.

06:49.670 --> 06:53.500
- Why?
- There's a photography exhibit for Jack Palmer.

06:53.674 --> 06:54.892
Up and coming.

06:55.066 --> 06:57.068
Everyone's raving about him.

06:57.242 --> 06:59.288
We can socialize a bit,

06:59.462 --> 07:02.900
rub some elbows,
get you a new job.

07:03.074 --> 07:06.643
She just said
that she loves her job. - Yeah, I'm totally fine with it.

07:06.817 --> 07:10.212
The amount of fine you are
with things really concerns me.

07:10.691 --> 07:13.128
7:00 p.m.
Already got us tickets.

07:14.390 --> 07:15.217
Fine.

07:17.045 --> 07:17.959
Mm.

07:30.972 --> 07:33.017
My parents invited you over for dinner soon.

07:33.888 --> 07:34.976
Your mom going
to be there?

07:35.629 --> 07:37.369
Um, she counts as a parent. Yes.

07:37.979 --> 07:39.850
Mm. Have to think about that.

07:40.851 --> 07:41.809
What do you mean?

07:42.636 --> 07:44.507
It's not that
she frightens me necessarily.

07:44.681 --> 07:47.858
- It's just-- She terrifies me.
- What?

07:48.032 --> 07:50.252
She's just always so nervous.
I think it's her eyes.

07:51.514 --> 07:54.517
Maybe you could get used to it
'cause it could be a very nice evening.

07:54.691 --> 07:56.911
Come on, Daisy. It's not like
I don't want to be there.

07:58.608 --> 07:59.566
Sounds like it.

08:00.175 --> 08:01.176
It's...

08:03.091 --> 08:06.398
With my last girlfriend,
everything went so fast, too fast.

08:07.138 --> 08:09.314
Hmm. We've been
dating for a year.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.882
I just don't want
to rush dinners.

08:12.056 --> 08:14.058
Okay? I, I, I just want to go
with the flow.

08:15.669 --> 08:16.496
Hey.

08:17.975 --> 08:19.411
We've got a good thing going.

08:21.283 --> 08:22.371
We do, don't we?

08:26.418 --> 08:28.508
Okay. Same page?

08:30.205 --> 08:33.034
- Mm.
- Do you want to maybe go, you know...

08:39.170 --> 08:41.042
How, how's that?

08:41.216 --> 08:42.304
That's good.

08:44.654 --> 08:45.699
Awesome.

08:46.917 --> 08:48.832
Well, yeah.

08:51.487 --> 08:54.490
- Hey, can we talk for a second?
- Yeah.

08:54.664 --> 08:56.753
Sure. Now?

08:57.885 --> 09:00.627
Um, never mind. Keep going.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.890
- You sure?
- Yeah. Yeah. Keep going.

09:05.457 --> 09:06.458
I feel like you're not sure.

09:06.633 --> 09:07.721
I'm super sure.

09:18.296 --> 09:19.167
Impressive.

09:19.776 --> 09:20.690
Thanks.

09:20.864 --> 09:22.518
Come on, August. Hurry up.

09:22.692 --> 09:24.041
Hey, where y'all going?
The bell hasn't even rung yet.

09:24.215 --> 09:25.913
We're trying to get
to third period early.

09:26.522 --> 09:28.219
Miss Bonneville has
a big announcement to make.

09:28.393 --> 09:30.613
- Ooh.
- We're hoping it's a new French easel.

09:31.658 --> 09:32.659
Hm.

09:35.705 --> 09:38.578
All right. Well,
you're all here.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.668
May as well get this over with.

09:42.625 --> 09:43.670
Get what over with?

09:46.498 --> 09:47.717
I'm leaving you.

09:47.891 --> 09:48.892
Wait.

09:50.372 --> 09:52.243
- What?
- I'm so sorry,

09:52.417 --> 09:55.725
but there has been
a blatant disregard

09:55.899 --> 09:58.554
for what I've been trying
to build here and I, I've had it.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.600
I can't finish this semester.

10:03.254 --> 10:05.430
Starting tomorrow,
this class will serve

10:05.605 --> 10:09.173
as an open study
period supervised by...

10:09.347 --> 10:10.435
I don't know who.

10:12.873 --> 10:13.961
You said you had good news.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.658
No, I said I had news.

10:15.832 --> 10:17.268
You supplied the good part.

10:17.442 --> 10:18.530
So no French easel?

10:18.705 --> 10:21.403
French easel? No. No.

10:22.534 --> 10:24.145
This is, like, our life.

10:24.319 --> 10:26.321
There's just a handful of you.

10:26.930 --> 10:28.453
No one has interest.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.542
I'm exhausted.

10:31.326 --> 10:34.111
I have been fighting
and fighting for years,

10:34.285 --> 10:35.896
clawing to get more funding.

10:36.505 --> 10:39.726
I've invested more time and
money than any teacher should.

10:40.857 --> 10:44.208
I love you kids,
but it's too much for me now.

10:45.949 --> 10:49.736
Surely there's a grant,
or donors or something.

10:50.258 --> 10:51.259
Who are you?

10:51.433 --> 10:52.739
I'm Daisy.

10:52.913 --> 10:54.784
Librarian. Hi.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.656
Oh, yeah, Daisy.

10:57.831 --> 10:58.875
You go find them.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.660
You go apply for them.

11:01.443 --> 11:02.400
I'm finished.

11:03.575 --> 11:04.664
This is bullshit.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.986
Oh, it's like
an exponential crisis.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.380
- Existential.
- Whatever.

11:25.554 --> 11:26.860
Just go take your piss.

11:27.774 --> 11:28.688
Gross.

11:29.558 --> 11:30.820
Sadie, on your way.

11:36.086 --> 11:38.567
Hey, guys, come on.
I know it's a big blow,

11:38.741 --> 11:39.916
but it's not the end
of the world.

11:40.090 --> 11:41.744
I thought you would
actually care.

11:42.397 --> 11:43.398
I do care.

11:44.051 --> 11:45.574
I'm just saying
it's going to work out.

11:48.708 --> 11:49.709
It doesn't seem like it.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.284
Isn't he brilliant?

12:43.458 --> 12:45.155
He certainly loves nude women.

12:45.721 --> 12:48.245
How do you reckon
she got into that position?

12:48.419 --> 12:49.290
Trash compactor?

12:51.335 --> 12:53.424
I certainly admire his gumption,
but he could at least

12:53.598 --> 12:55.165
put some clothes on
at least a few of them.

12:55.339 --> 12:57.559
Oh, but that would be
boring then, wouldn't it?

12:57.733 --> 13:00.083
Yeah, I can't say
you're wrong there.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.651
- Where are you going?
- Food.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.174
You already have food.

13:05.175 --> 13:06.568
That's my favorite piece.

13:07.221 --> 13:10.920
Oh, shit. Um, what did you say?

13:11.703 --> 13:13.705
The portrait
that you're looking at,

13:13.880 --> 13:15.142
it's my favorite one.

13:15.316 --> 13:16.534
So vulnerable.

13:18.101 --> 13:19.842
I'm wondering
how that's vulnerable.

13:21.017 --> 13:25.152
Well, you know,
to expose yourself in that way,

13:25.326 --> 13:27.458
in that fashion,

13:28.242 --> 13:29.634
find the animal within.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.375
It's a woman in some mesh.

13:31.898 --> 13:34.509
So you don't think
there's more to it than that?

13:35.553 --> 13:36.990
The animal thing is interesting.

13:38.165 --> 13:39.906
Maybe that's what
he wants us to think.

13:41.124 --> 13:42.865
- He?
- The photographer dude.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.173
Right. Yeah. Uh...

13:46.956 --> 13:48.915
I had heard that, um...

13:49.089 --> 13:51.526
Someone said she had to stay
in that position for, like, over an hour.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.876
Much to his dismay, I'm sure.

13:54.050 --> 13:55.182
I don't follow.

13:55.356 --> 13:56.444
Lots of naked chicks.

13:57.140 --> 13:58.794
Well, come on. I mean, that's--

13:58.968 --> 14:00.361
It's all for the art, I suppose.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.972
- Right. The sacrifice.
- Exactly.

14:05.105 --> 14:08.195
I should, uh, talk
to a few more guests,

14:08.369 --> 14:09.631
but this was--

14:09.805 --> 14:11.111
Well, I didn't...

14:12.155 --> 14:13.548
- Oh, Daisy.
- Daisy.

14:13.722 --> 14:15.593
- That's a nice name.
- Thanks.

14:16.681 --> 14:18.074
Why do you have to go and...?

14:22.209 --> 14:24.037
Shit. You're Jack Palmer?

14:26.996 --> 14:27.997
Have a nice night, Daisy.

14:32.088 --> 14:34.047
It looked like
he was flirting with you.

14:34.221 --> 14:35.613
- We have to go.
- What? Why?

14:35.787 --> 14:37.050
I just insulted him.

14:37.224 --> 14:39.139
Oh, it didn't look like that
to me.

14:39.313 --> 14:41.445
- It looked like flirting.
- I have a boyfriend.

14:41.619 --> 14:43.795
Oh, I'll find out
if he's single.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.015
I know I'm saying words,
and there's air coming out of my mouth.

14:46.189 --> 14:47.712
They just don't seem to land.

14:48.452 --> 14:49.758
Great. Thanks.

14:57.418 --> 14:58.506
Mm. Mm.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.125
Mm.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.650
Oh, handsome.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.177
You all right?
Did I do something?

15:18.004 --> 15:18.961
No. I'm okay.

15:20.789 --> 15:22.008
Mm. Smell good.

15:22.486 --> 15:23.357
Well, ain't it?

15:36.848 --> 15:38.720
It's been a while
since we've, uh,

15:38.894 --> 15:40.243
caught up since the move.

15:43.203 --> 15:46.380
You know, you're right.
It has just been "Go, go, go," hasn't it?

15:46.554 --> 15:47.990
Well, that's putting it lightly.

15:50.732 --> 15:51.907
What do you want to talk about?

15:52.995 --> 15:55.389
Well, how's life?

15:56.520 --> 15:59.045
It's fun. It's, it's good
now that you're here.

16:01.569 --> 16:03.049
That's about it, I guess.

16:03.223 --> 16:04.050
Mm.

16:05.747 --> 16:06.922
Cool.

16:09.794 --> 16:10.970
Anything else on your mind?

16:11.840 --> 16:14.103
Mm, no, not really.

16:19.152 --> 16:20.066
Mm.

16:23.112 --> 16:25.027
Okay? I'm just gonna splunk
right into it.

16:25.201 --> 16:27.595
I went to the doctor's office
the other day and...

16:29.205 --> 16:30.685
...he said, um, that

16:31.207 --> 16:33.775
I don't have much time.

16:36.212 --> 16:38.475
What are you telling me,
Daisy, are you dying?

16:38.649 --> 16:41.913
No. Gynecologist.
No cancer or anything.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.655
- Just egg stuff.
- Oh, well, thank God.

16:44.829 --> 16:47.267
I mean, don't say eggs stuff,
but, I mean,

16:47.441 --> 16:49.747
good for, you know,
not dying and all.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.706
Yeah, uh, listen,

16:51.880 --> 16:55.144
I'm about to be 40,
and so biology has a way of...

16:58.017 --> 16:59.888
- Oh.
- Yeah.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.759
And he said that
if I wanted to have kids,

17:01.933 --> 17:03.979
I really need to start
thinking about that, and...

17:05.589 --> 17:07.330
I'm not saying "Hey,
let's make a baby right now."

17:07.504 --> 17:08.462
I just...

17:09.376 --> 17:11.030
- Not at all.
- Okay. Well, thank God.

17:12.988 --> 17:15.469
Well, I just want to see
if that was something that...

17:16.861 --> 17:18.124
...you know, you might...

17:21.692 --> 17:23.694
Okay. Uh, I'll be honest.

17:24.304 --> 17:27.046
Maybe, I don't know.
I'd want to be married first.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.744
Um, and we agreed
to take it slow.

17:29.918 --> 17:32.225
And I always liked the idea
of living with someone

17:32.399 --> 17:35.489
for a little while before
I made that decision. So...

17:36.316 --> 17:37.273
Yeah.

17:37.926 --> 17:39.319
Okay. Yeah. No, sure.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.631
You mad at me?

17:47.805 --> 17:50.330
I mean, I've told you
my rationale from the get-go.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.636
Yeah. And I told you mine.
I wanted kids one day.

17:52.810 --> 17:55.422
- Wait a minute. That's not fair.
- No, this is my fault.

17:55.596 --> 17:59.121
I should have talked about this
before my lease was up and I just moved in.

17:59.295 --> 18:00.992
I didn't know there was
gonna be such a hard deadline.

18:02.124 --> 18:05.040
Gosh, time is such a bitch.

18:10.263 --> 18:12.787
I didn't know that having kids
was that important to you.

18:13.918 --> 18:14.876
Yeah.

18:20.925 --> 18:23.189
Uh, I don't know what to say
right now, Daisy.

18:24.668 --> 18:26.061
Back to square one.

18:26.235 --> 18:27.715
Not necessarily. I--

18:27.889 --> 18:29.195
Do you or don't you want kids?

18:29.369 --> 18:31.110
Yes or no? No gray area, please.

18:38.682 --> 18:40.249
Then you should've said
that from the beginning.

18:41.903 --> 18:44.471
I'll stay with my parents.
Get my stuff out of here.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.212
Wait, are, are we breaking up?

18:46.386 --> 18:48.562
I don't see any reason
to waste any more time.

18:49.737 --> 18:50.607
Well...

18:52.261 --> 18:55.221
- Dang.
- Dang is not the perfect thing to say right now, Stephen.

18:55.395 --> 18:57.353
I know. I'm sorry. It's just...

19:02.097 --> 19:03.577
Suddenly, I'm not
all that hungry.

19:04.534 --> 19:05.361
Me neither.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.134
What do you think that's about?

20:08.337 --> 20:09.338
Square one.

20:16.998 --> 20:18.217
Miss Bea, are you okay?

20:18.391 --> 20:19.305
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

20:21.002 --> 20:22.046
You guys?

20:23.222 --> 20:25.354
Besides hating life, you mean?

20:27.748 --> 20:28.966
At least you have a purpose.

20:29.706 --> 20:30.968
Not for the next hour.

20:31.447 --> 20:32.927
Not for the next life.

20:44.634 --> 20:46.419
Hey, where's my <i>art du jour</i>?

21:07.309 --> 21:08.223
Come in.

21:09.703 --> 21:11.618
- Oh, hey, Daze.
- Hey.

21:11.792 --> 21:13.663
I wanted to ask you
about Miss Bonneville leaving.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.796
I mean,
the kids had just gutted. - Oh, yeah.

21:15.970 --> 21:17.928
She shouldn't have
said all that. Wasn't supposed to come out

21:18.102 --> 21:20.235
till the end of semester,
and I was supposed to make the announcement.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.629
Can't you just give her
the resources she needs to finish it out?

21:22.803 --> 21:24.457
That would at least
give us a little-- - You know I love you, Daze.

21:24.631 --> 21:27.198
But this isn't some fancy
high school you pay tuition for.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.549
Or one that pays for supplies.
We're public.

21:29.723 --> 21:32.073
- Yeah.
- And public schools are a business.

21:32.247 --> 21:34.641
And in Louisiana,
investments are made

21:34.815 --> 21:36.338
in programs with interest.

21:37.034 --> 21:38.906
- Football.
- Football.

21:39.080 --> 21:42.170
Sports. Hell, women's volleyball
is doing pretty well.

21:43.084 --> 21:44.477
But aside from, what,

21:44.651 --> 21:47.001
eight students
in the arts program,

21:47.175 --> 21:48.350
I hate say it, but who cares?

21:48.524 --> 21:50.396
- Dad!
- I'm sorry,

21:50.570 --> 21:54.748
but when I weigh eight
versus 2,000 fans in the stands on Friday,

21:54.922 --> 21:58.491
- it's a no brainer.
- During World War II, they asked Winston Churchill--

21:58.665 --> 22:01.407
They asked him to cut funding
for the arts, and he said,

22:01.581 --> 22:03.670
"But then what
would we be fighting for?"

22:03.844 --> 22:05.585
I'm the one
who told you about that quote.

22:06.281 --> 22:07.413
Well?

22:11.939 --> 22:13.636
It's money. Relevance.

22:14.724 --> 22:17.031
You know I'm a big supporter
of the arts, Daze,

22:17.205 --> 22:21.035
but I also know where I stand as
principal of this institution,

22:21.209 --> 22:22.645
which is, after all...

22:22.819 --> 22:25.300
- A business.
- Exactly.

22:26.562 --> 22:28.825
Is there anything else
I can do for you, hon?

22:28.999 --> 22:31.611
I imagine you have other things
to worry about more than this.

22:31.785 --> 22:34.353
No, I'm trying
not to think about it.

22:34.527 --> 22:35.354
I don't know.

22:38.487 --> 22:39.662
Well, maybe this, uh,

22:40.271 --> 22:42.796
well, change in routine
will help with some perspective.

22:43.971 --> 22:45.233
Maybe you're right.

22:46.843 --> 22:47.844
See you tonight.

22:59.203 --> 23:01.684

23:50.951 --> 23:52.343
I said it already.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.258
You know, I'm exhausted.

23:54.998 --> 23:59.002
I mean, I, I, I can't even
get the most basic materials.

24:00.308 --> 24:03.790
Brushes, good paper,
non-huffable glue, huh.

24:04.486 --> 24:08.882
Coach Davis snaps his fingers
and pfft, your dad comes crawling.

24:09.491 --> 24:11.101
It's just not that simple,
Miss Bonneville.

24:11.885 --> 24:13.930
You're a grown woman.
Call me Helen.

24:14.104 --> 24:17.760
Okay, Helen, um,
the kids are devastated.

24:18.326 --> 24:19.980
They will find their way.

24:20.154 --> 24:21.895
I don't know that they will
without you.

24:22.069 --> 24:25.246
I mean, can't you just stay
until December?

24:26.203 --> 24:29.424
I don't know. Run through
all the materials and supplies.

24:30.556 --> 24:31.644
A grace period.

24:34.255 --> 24:36.518
Uh, it's all so lifeless,
isn't it?

24:36.692 --> 24:38.302
Politics. Money.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.218
Who cares about getting
a well-rounded education, right?

24:42.437 --> 24:46.485
You know, I think I've earned
the time to paint and write,

24:46.659 --> 24:49.400
and...
who knows, maybe even act.

24:49.923 --> 24:51.490
But the teaching no, no.

24:53.709 --> 24:55.624
I've run out of energy for it.

25:00.194 --> 25:02.370
You seem to really
care about them.

25:02.544 --> 25:03.893
Why don't you help them?

25:04.372 --> 25:05.852
I wouldn't even know
where to begin.

25:06.461 --> 25:08.289
You know what I tell
all my artists?

25:10.421 --> 25:11.945
Get creative.

25:31.573 --> 25:33.140
So, first you come to my show

25:33.314 --> 25:35.534
and you insult
my photography... - Yeah, I'm sorry.

25:35.708 --> 25:37.231
...and then you're just going
to show up out of nowhere,

25:37.405 --> 25:39.189
and you're going
to ask me for help? - Yep.

25:39.363 --> 25:41.627
See? I like that. That's bold.

25:42.236 --> 25:44.455
Wow. That is
a beautiful picture. - Hmm.

25:44.630 --> 25:47.154
Look at that.
They're so cute. - Yeah.

25:47.328 --> 25:49.286
Smiles are mesmerizing,
aren't they?

25:49.460 --> 25:51.288
Captured it in Angola.

25:51.462 --> 25:54.291
Think it kind of has
this glimmer of hope

25:54.465 --> 25:56.467
in a devastating time.

25:57.077 --> 25:58.426
Through family.

25:59.775 --> 26:01.734
Well, didn't expect that
from you.

26:02.604 --> 26:03.736
Yeah, it's not all naked women.

26:05.215 --> 26:07.391
Unfortunately, your story,

26:07.566 --> 26:09.655
it's not all that unfamiliar
to me.

26:09.829 --> 26:11.918
These arts programs,
they keep getting cut.

26:12.092 --> 26:13.702
It's bit of a national trend.

26:13.876 --> 26:15.617
- Hm.
- So what were you thinking?

26:15.791 --> 26:18.011
Uh, keep in mind, too.
I'm a freelancer.

26:18.185 --> 26:20.448
So, like, schedules,
not really my jam.

26:20.622 --> 26:22.406
I totally get it. The class
meets three times a week,

26:22.581 --> 26:24.452
only for an hour.
But right after lunch.

26:24.626 --> 26:26.672
Eight kids?
What's your play on all this?

26:26.846 --> 26:28.804
I think I'm really close
to two of them.

26:28.978 --> 26:31.328
- You think?
- Yeah, it's hard to tell with teenagers,

26:31.502 --> 26:33.679
but it was the collective look
that "Armageddon is near"

26:33.853 --> 26:35.594
on their faces
when the teacher quit, so...

26:36.595 --> 26:39.554
I guess you never know
what they could become. - Exactly.

26:39.728 --> 26:42.078
Like, their effect
on the world. - Yes.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.254
Okay, uh, let's see.

26:45.212 --> 26:46.866
Hmm. It's tough.

26:47.867 --> 26:50.565
I'm saving up for this trip
to Haiti in January,

26:50.739 --> 26:53.568
so I kind of have to hold on
to all the cash flow I can get.

26:53.742 --> 26:56.963
Uh, plus, I got to be some
sort of fiscally responsible.

26:57.137 --> 26:59.835
- I could pay if it helps.
- Oh, no, no, no, sorry, that's, that's not what I meant.

27:00.009 --> 27:02.490
It's just like if, uh,
commission were to come up-- - It's done.

27:02.664 --> 27:06.059
- We're paying you.
- Mm. They cut the funding for the program.

27:06.233 --> 27:08.322
I guarantee the school
is not going to cover the costs.

27:08.496 --> 27:10.803
Don't worry about it.
It's handled. Got it.

27:11.455 --> 27:14.763
- Okay. Uh, how?
- Would that do it?

27:15.372 --> 27:18.288
I mean, I don't know
if I feel comfortable.

27:18.462 --> 27:20.508
I mean, you get to help
some kids uncover their creative selves

27:20.682 --> 27:21.901
and get some money.

27:22.728 --> 27:23.729
Would that do it?

27:27.820 --> 27:28.734
Yeah.

27:29.430 --> 27:32.302
Okay. See you Monday.
One o'clock.

27:32.912 --> 27:34.478
Monday, one o'clock.

27:47.535 --> 27:49.755
So, he volunteers one hour every three days,

27:49.929 --> 27:51.887
for the rest of the semester.
Then what?

27:52.061 --> 27:53.802
I don't know.
I figured it's a great start.

27:54.324 --> 27:56.936
It's a good start. I'm just
thinking long term here.

27:57.110 --> 27:58.981
I don't have
a full-fledged plan yet. - Daisy.

27:59.155 --> 28:00.940
You're right. I haven't done
anything like this before, so--

28:01.114 --> 28:02.593
- And I understand that--
- You know what?

28:02.768 --> 28:03.943
I'll chew on it tonight
and I'll let you know.

28:04.117 --> 28:06.119
- Daisy!
- Oh, my Lord, Mom. What?

28:06.293 --> 28:08.991
You've been ignoring our guest.

28:13.474 --> 28:15.868
Well... lovely meatloaf.

28:17.260 --> 28:19.262
I'm sorry, Bradley. I don't know
what my mother has told you,

28:19.436 --> 28:22.091
- bless her heart--
- I know you didn't just say bless her heart.

28:22.265 --> 28:25.355
But she doesn't seem to care
that I just broke up with my boyfriend last night.

28:25.529 --> 28:28.445
So I'm on hiatus while I try
to help some of my students.

28:28.619 --> 28:30.447
- Not your students.
- My kids, then.

28:30.621 --> 28:32.754
Nope. Don't have
any of those, either.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.759
What's the...

28:37.933 --> 28:40.109
...what's the long term plan
to keep the class?

28:40.631 --> 28:43.504
I'm willing to work
with you here, Daze, but this is your show,

28:43.678 --> 28:45.419
- and I'm just not going to--
- Show?

28:45.593 --> 28:47.856
Yeah, your show. I'm a very
busy man. So I'm not--

28:48.030 --> 28:49.423
I could put on an art show.

28:49.597 --> 28:51.207
A silent auction,
raise money that way.

28:51.381 --> 28:52.992
Preposterous.

28:53.166 --> 28:55.385
I'm sorry, Bradley.

28:55.559 --> 28:58.432
Get real money for supplies.
Maybe create some more buzz.

28:58.606 --> 29:00.739
- Get more students interested.
- Okay. Okay.

29:01.565 --> 29:04.090
Okay. Date, time?

29:04.264 --> 29:06.005
I don't know. I just thought
of it like five seconds ago.

29:06.179 --> 29:08.747
This is a big distraction,
if you ask me.

29:08.921 --> 29:11.488
We'll need all the time
we can get. - And rude.

29:11.662 --> 29:13.752
December 13th, last Friday
before the end of semester.

29:15.101 --> 29:17.103
Art show.

29:17.277 --> 29:19.018
Just need a time.

29:19.192 --> 29:20.846
I don't know. 7:00 p.m.?

29:21.020 --> 29:22.282
7:00 p.m. it is.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.763
Clock's ticking.

29:24.937 --> 29:26.982
Don't expect my help
with any of this.

29:27.635 --> 29:28.984
Don't worry, I'm not.

29:29.724 --> 29:31.595
You should get back
to your guest.

29:36.513 --> 29:37.776
Ouch.

29:43.172 --> 29:45.131
This is really good meatloaf.

29:45.305 --> 29:47.002
Oh, Bradley, stuff it!

29:56.359 --> 29:57.404
<i>♪ Oh ♪</i>

30:05.804 --> 30:07.196
Uh, Miss Bea...

30:08.328 --> 30:09.808
...where's this Jack Palmer guy?

30:11.244 --> 30:12.332
He'll be here.

30:12.506 --> 30:14.377
He's probably just running late.

30:15.596 --> 30:16.684
I hope so.

30:19.078 --> 30:20.775
No disrespect, Miss Bea.

30:20.949 --> 30:23.647
But what if this guy
doesn't show up?

30:23.822 --> 30:24.866
What do you know about art?

30:27.390 --> 30:28.696
Um...

30:30.567 --> 30:31.786
Let me check.

30:34.484 --> 30:37.792
<i>♪ Keep looking at the back doors

30:38.924 --> 30:41.056

30:47.280 --> 30:48.455
Eat.

30:49.499 --> 30:50.718
I'm not that hungry anymore.

30:51.893 --> 30:52.894
More for me.

30:55.941 --> 30:57.420
So it went well?

30:58.552 --> 31:00.510
It was rough.

31:02.164 --> 31:05.211
But I'm going
to nail it on Wednesday. Even if Jack doesn't show up.

31:05.385 --> 31:06.865
Yeah, absolutely.

31:08.692 --> 31:11.391
You know, I would start
by organizing this place.

31:11.565 --> 31:14.394
It's got scatterbrain
written all over it.

31:14.568 --> 31:17.788
Mm, yeah, well,
that's Bonneville.

31:21.792 --> 31:24.621
We need a fresh start,
change things up.

31:25.100 --> 31:26.232
Narrow the focus.

31:27.842 --> 31:29.844
Well, let's get started,
shall we?

31:30.497 --> 31:32.107
- We?
- Yeah.

31:32.281 --> 31:34.718
I want to bask
in your newfound excitement too.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.111
Aw.

31:37.025 --> 31:38.592
- Hey.
- Hey, Mr. Bea.

31:40.159 --> 31:41.508
Pulling some after hours, huh?

31:41.682 --> 31:43.684
Yep. About to whip
this place into shape.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.120
I see you've got food.

31:45.294 --> 31:46.730
I'll let your mother know.

31:47.993 --> 31:49.777
Dinner in the classroom.

31:49.951 --> 31:51.605
after a first day,

31:52.301 --> 31:53.912
the life of a true educator.

31:56.305 --> 31:57.524
I'll see you at home.

32:29.251 --> 32:30.731
Absolutely not.

32:31.688 --> 32:33.908
Look, I've come to terms with
the fact that I'm getting older.

32:34.082 --> 32:35.431
So there's a plan C.

32:35.605 --> 32:36.955
You might just like it.

32:37.129 --> 32:38.695
Donor insemination.

32:39.479 --> 32:41.046
We get a jump start
on the process.

32:41.220 --> 32:42.612
I might need your help
raising the child

32:42.786 --> 32:44.788
if Mr. Right
doesn't come along first.

32:45.789 --> 32:48.227
Doesn't have to be A-B-C.

32:48.749 --> 32:51.970
Maybe it's ACB.

32:53.188 --> 32:55.060
That's not the proper way.

32:55.669 --> 32:57.976
I just got off
birth control, Mom.

32:58.150 --> 32:59.586
I'm trying here.

33:00.413 --> 33:03.459
I saw them in the trash.
Why the change of heart?

33:04.808 --> 33:06.245
Does it really matter to you?

33:08.073 --> 33:09.161
How much?

33:37.319 --> 33:38.799
Is tomorrow still looking rough?

33:43.021 --> 33:45.501
These kids need you.
I have no clue what I'm doing.

33:45.675 --> 33:47.895
I mean, you could give me
a paintbrush and I'd try to eat rice with it.

33:49.070 --> 33:50.028
Here.

33:51.551 --> 33:53.553
Oh, God.

33:54.728 --> 33:56.991
And I may have promised
my dad that we're putting on

33:57.165 --> 33:58.949
an art show in December.
So there's that.

33:59.124 --> 34:00.690
I'm sorry. What?

34:00.864 --> 34:02.997
A silent auction,
you know, to sell the kids' work

34:03.171 --> 34:04.651
to rai-- raise money
for the program. I mean,

34:04.825 --> 34:06.566
I told him that you and I
would put it together.

34:08.133 --> 34:10.483
Do you always speak
for other people or is that sort of a new thing?

34:11.310 --> 34:12.354
It's a new thing.

34:13.486 --> 34:14.400
Mm.

34:15.096 --> 34:16.228
Cool.

34:19.013 --> 34:21.624
Okay, the hard walkout thing,
it's not gonna work every time.

34:37.684 --> 34:39.599
- That's what you got.
- I told you.

34:39.773 --> 34:41.209
I was hoping for
an after-school shopping trip.

34:41.383 --> 34:43.037
Um, I have a little budget
for that.

34:44.517 --> 34:45.605
Oh.

34:47.911 --> 34:50.175
Whoa, Miss Bea!

34:51.001 --> 34:52.655
Love what you did
with the place!

34:52.829 --> 34:55.049
Yeah. It looks like
someone actually cares.

35:10.369 --> 35:12.153
Uh...

35:12.327 --> 35:13.502
Uh, okay.

35:15.287 --> 35:18.116
Well, we are getting started
a little bit behind,

35:18.290 --> 35:19.726
but that's good.

35:20.857 --> 35:22.076
I always find
that the creative mind

35:22.250 --> 35:24.426
thrives with an uphill battle.

35:25.079 --> 35:28.735
You throw your inhibitions away
and you just-- you go with it.

35:29.953 --> 35:32.434
Some people are going to say
that that's winging it, but...

35:33.522 --> 35:34.480
...I say organic.

35:35.742 --> 35:37.352
Now, do we have
limited supplies?

35:38.527 --> 35:40.007
Yeah.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.661
Yeah, that's putting it lightly.

35:42.749 --> 35:43.619
But...

35:44.838 --> 35:46.492
...you don't need
a high-end studio

35:46.666 --> 35:48.624
to create something
that's visceral.

35:52.541 --> 35:56.066
We will get more supplies

35:56.241 --> 35:59.374
to create a one-of-a-kind show.

36:00.114 --> 36:01.159
But until then...

36:02.682 --> 36:03.813
...this is your centerpiece.

36:05.554 --> 36:09.428
This is what the entire exhibit
is going to revolve around.

36:10.298 --> 36:11.343
What piece?

36:13.301 --> 36:16.304
With those supplies,

36:16.870 --> 36:18.480
and this trash...

36:20.526 --> 36:23.529
...and the time we have
between now and the exhibit.

36:24.269 --> 36:26.793
Tell me something,
but with a sculpture,

36:28.360 --> 36:30.275
All right, guys,
let's get to work.

36:30.753 --> 36:34.192
Uh, what do you want it to say
with the sculpture?

36:37.934 --> 36:38.892
We're not done yet.

36:44.289 --> 36:45.812
When we snap a photo,

36:45.986 --> 36:48.815
we are looking for the way
the light falls. Sure.

36:48.989 --> 36:50.817
Composition. All of that.

36:51.557 --> 36:55.909
But most importantly, we are
looking for a moment in time.

36:57.345 --> 36:59.652
<i>That look on someone's face,
right?</i>

36:59.826 --> 37:02.350
Something you couldn't
manufacture even if you try.

37:02.524 --> 37:05.832
<i>♪ A little walking
On the corner of the night ♪</i>

37:06.615 --> 37:10.358
<i>♪ A little reminder
That it's already daylight ♪</i>

37:10.532 --> 37:12.360
Such a good start
for everybody today.

37:12.534 --> 37:14.101
Really. Just so good.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.411
And scoop, scoop.

37:19.585 --> 37:20.977
Open, open.

37:21.151 --> 37:22.240
Very good. Keep going.

37:22.414 --> 37:24.024
Keep going. Eyes up, boys.

37:24.198 --> 37:26.635
Yep. We're shooting this
within a week.

37:26.809 --> 37:28.115
- Hey.
- How's it going?

37:28.289 --> 37:30.596
- I feel good.
- No, with the kids.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.686
Oh, yeah, they're cool.

37:34.469 --> 37:37.211
I could really use some with
a little less self-awareness.

37:37.385 --> 37:39.909
Chad, buddy, loosen it up
a little bit.

37:43.565 --> 37:44.958
Oh, we have to get back
to the studio, so...

37:45.132 --> 37:47.090
- All right.
- It's nice to see you.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.353
- Yeah.
- Thanks for having us.

37:48.527 --> 37:50.093
Yeah. Bye, Jack.

37:53.488 --> 37:54.881
I know. I know.

37:55.055 --> 37:56.709
Okay, bye.

37:56.883 --> 38:00.190
All right. Let's just do this
all again, shall we?

38:30.525 --> 38:32.266
I was jealous.

38:32.440 --> 38:35.487
Well... Oh, I haven't eaten
anything all day.

38:35.661 --> 38:37.663
Would you want
to go grab something?

38:37.837 --> 38:38.620
Absolutely.

38:38.794 --> 38:39.882
- Okay.
- Yes.

38:43.059 --> 38:44.496
That's all you.

38:44.670 --> 38:47.020
Well, not actually, come on.

38:47.194 --> 38:49.588
You gotta save some of
that for me. - Look, those are three berries.

38:49.762 --> 38:50.850
- I'm getting one.
- All right.

38:51.024 --> 38:51.981
Right.

38:52.852 --> 38:53.809
So...

38:55.245 --> 38:58.074
Mm. Been a while since I've
shared dessert with someone.

38:58.248 --> 38:59.554
Yeah?

38:59.728 --> 39:00.773
I haven't been on a date...

39:02.514 --> 39:03.863
...in a long time.

39:04.646 --> 39:06.779
Well, who says
this is a date, mister?

39:09.999 --> 39:11.740
Oh, no...

39:12.959 --> 39:14.264
- Sorry.
- I'm kidding.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.919
Oh.

39:18.573 --> 39:21.576
I have to ask you a question
that kind of puts me in the gallows.

39:22.142 --> 39:23.099
But...

39:24.057 --> 39:27.582
...you know, uh, about
that check that I gave you.

39:27.756 --> 39:29.541
- Oh.
- I was just wondering when you were going to--

39:29.715 --> 39:31.238
or if you have deposited it.

39:31.412 --> 39:33.153
You're talking about this check?

39:34.807 --> 39:35.982
Yeah. Great.

39:36.635 --> 39:38.680
So, uh, do you know
when you're going to...?

39:38.854 --> 39:39.986
Yeah.

39:43.032 --> 39:44.643
Wait. What are you doing?

39:44.817 --> 39:45.731
I don't want it.

39:48.473 --> 39:49.212
What do you mean
you don't want it?

39:49.387 --> 39:50.344
I don't want it.

39:53.739 --> 39:56.263
Well, isn't that the whole
reason why you showed up? -

39:56.437 --> 39:57.612
Okay. All right.

39:57.786 --> 40:00.049
Yeah. Well, fine.

40:01.660 --> 40:03.226
I feel like a jerk about that.

40:05.664 --> 40:07.056
Well, you're forgiven.

40:08.841 --> 40:09.755
Thank you.

40:11.713 --> 40:12.627
And...

40:14.194 --> 40:16.544
...I see why you went to bat
for these kids.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.373
They are pretty great, huh?

40:19.547 --> 40:20.766
Yep.

40:23.203 --> 40:24.987
It makes you think, though.

40:27.163 --> 40:28.077
About what?

40:30.079 --> 40:30.950
Like...

40:32.299 --> 40:34.910
...if I had a kid, right?

40:35.824 --> 40:38.261
Like some, you know,
just a toddler running around,

40:38.436 --> 40:41.003
wreaking havoc all over
the place. Or, or if you did.

40:42.004 --> 40:44.833
- Go on.
- Well, how difficult...

40:46.400 --> 40:49.185
...that would make what
we're doing for these kids.

40:50.404 --> 40:51.884
But, uh...

40:53.102 --> 40:55.148
...now, you know,
we're able to help

40:55.888 --> 40:56.889
eight of them.

40:58.847 --> 41:00.545
So, yeah, I mean...

41:03.983 --> 41:04.940
Thank you.

41:08.640 --> 41:09.597
Cheers.

41:12.818 --> 41:13.819
To the kids.

41:15.342 --> 41:16.604
To the kids.

41:18.258 --> 41:19.868
Also to this cheesecake.

41:20.390 --> 41:22.131
- Hey.
- I told you I'm not gonna share.

41:36.711 --> 41:37.625
You do it yet?

41:39.366 --> 41:40.323
Mom?

41:42.369 --> 41:44.632
How long
have you been standing there?

41:47.940 --> 41:48.854
No.

41:50.246 --> 41:52.771
They recommend that you wait
at least a month so you're off birth control.

41:52.945 --> 41:54.381
Even if I didn't know
that was bullshit--

41:54.555 --> 41:56.209
- Whoa!
- I'd say it has been a month.

41:57.906 --> 42:00.039
Uh, well, time flies, huh?

42:00.213 --> 42:02.911
Do I really need to say
clock's ticking again?

42:03.085 --> 42:04.652
You're single. Fine.

42:04.826 --> 42:07.481
But what about
your ACB proposal?

42:07.655 --> 42:11.137
And you're wasting your time
with that ludicrous art project.

42:11.311 --> 42:13.661
I called all
the insemination clinics.

42:14.183 --> 42:16.142
No inquiries on your behalf.

42:16.316 --> 42:17.535
That's frightening.

42:17.709 --> 42:19.667
Your focus is not
in the right place.

42:19.841 --> 42:23.149
You're acting like you're
living in the glory days again,

42:23.323 --> 42:25.717
Well, maybe 39 is my glory days.

42:25.891 --> 42:28.676
Plus, if it makes
you feel any better,

42:29.329 --> 42:31.505
I went on a date last night
with Jack, and I was happy.

42:31.679 --> 42:32.637
Jack Palmer?

42:32.811 --> 42:35.640
He's a tomcat, a, a, a player.

42:35.814 --> 42:37.337
Everyone knows this.

42:37.511 --> 42:39.295
You seemed all about it
at his art show.

42:39.469 --> 42:41.689
According to my bridge club,
he gets around.

42:41.863 --> 42:42.951
Your bridge club?

42:44.474 --> 42:45.780
You're wasting your time.

42:47.608 --> 42:50.045
You said you wanted a child.
Remember?

42:50.219 --> 42:51.481
Someone to nurture.

42:51.656 --> 42:52.874
I was 16.

42:53.048 --> 42:55.485
Then you were 24
and then you were 30.

42:55.660 --> 42:57.966
Well, maybe I'm not
as with that anymore.

42:58.140 --> 42:59.707
With that?

43:00.534 --> 43:01.840
You're lying to yourself.

43:02.405 --> 43:05.321
- This must be a phase.
- What if it's not?

43:05.495 --> 43:08.063
Well, then,
I want my money back.

43:09.325 --> 43:12.198
No, You know what?
You keep it. It'll help you.

43:12.372 --> 43:15.114
- With what?
- Moving cost.

43:15.288 --> 43:18.334
Rent. Some place else.

43:50.366 --> 43:51.411
Eden!

43:52.064 --> 43:54.066
- Mm.
- Coffee!

43:54.240 --> 43:56.285
Mm. Fine.

44:03.989 --> 44:06.121
I think I need to talk
to Jack about the kid thing.

44:06.295 --> 44:08.820
Daisy, it is way too early
for this.

44:08.994 --> 44:10.169
Fine. Eat a bagel.

44:10.343 --> 44:11.692
You eat a bagel.

44:15.565 --> 44:16.958
Fine, sure.

44:17.132 --> 44:18.960
I waited a whole year
to talk to Stephen

44:19.134 --> 44:21.180
about this and look
where it got me.

44:21.746 --> 44:25.488
It opened the opportunity for
you to meet Jack, who is fun.

44:26.141 --> 44:27.316
And creative.

44:27.926 --> 44:29.797
- And...
- Sexy.

44:29.971 --> 44:30.929
Sexy.

44:32.321 --> 44:34.367
And you just had
your first date last night.

44:34.846 --> 44:37.805
If you go through this
and that guy doesn't run for the hills,

44:37.979 --> 44:39.807
I will completely question
that guy's sanity.

44:39.981 --> 44:41.113
I just need to know
if it's something

44:41.287 --> 44:43.681
that he wants,
you know, someday.

44:45.030 --> 44:45.944
There's no harm in that.

44:46.901 --> 44:47.902
Okay.

44:48.468 --> 44:51.427
I say this as someone
who loves and trusts

44:51.601 --> 44:54.300
and is consistently
confused by you,

44:54.474 --> 44:55.562
it's a bad idea.

44:55.736 --> 44:56.998
But Jack's different.

44:57.172 --> 44:59.609
I mean, he's kind
and understanding,

44:59.784 --> 45:01.437
and he's in tune with himself.

45:04.179 --> 45:07.008
And I feel like time
is running out for me.

45:08.488 --> 45:10.664
I have this literal feeling.

45:12.318 --> 45:14.146
Okay, I'm going to create
an app that goes

45:14.320 --> 45:15.713
straight to your brain
that warns me

45:15.887 --> 45:17.192
of your next thought
and why you're having it.

45:17.366 --> 45:19.542
Like the weather app,
but Daisy's brain.

45:20.892 --> 45:24.025
- I'm gonna ask him.
- You have selective hearing, you know that?

45:24.199 --> 45:25.723
Thank you for talking me
through this. It was very helpful.

45:26.419 --> 45:27.768
Selective hearing.

45:28.464 --> 45:29.509
Bye.

45:45.699 --> 45:46.744
Psst. Hey.

45:46.918 --> 45:47.875
Daisy?

45:48.049 --> 45:49.529
- Lunchtime yet.
- Hmm.

45:50.225 --> 45:52.880
- Uh, about four minutes.
- Oh. Mm.

45:55.927 --> 46:00.670
So I think a guy like you would
want full disclosure. Yeah?

46:00.845 --> 46:03.021
Oh. A guy like me?

46:05.110 --> 46:07.503
I'm potentially about to ruin
something great.

46:08.635 --> 46:09.897
How so?

46:10.637 --> 46:12.204
Simply by talking.

46:12.378 --> 46:14.815
Never knew a civil conversation
could do that.

46:18.688 --> 46:21.735
Look, Daze, if it makes you feel
any better about whatever's on your mind,

46:21.909 --> 46:24.172
you know, I am an artist, sure,

46:24.346 --> 46:26.566
but I'm rational, you know?

46:27.436 --> 46:28.524
I do listen.

46:29.090 --> 46:30.048
Just spit.

46:31.049 --> 46:32.964
Well, my ex-boyfriend,

46:33.138 --> 46:35.314
about a day before I came
waltzing into your studio--

46:35.488 --> 46:37.403
Oh, no. Jealousy issues?

46:37.577 --> 46:39.013
- Stalker?
- No.

46:40.319 --> 46:42.974
We actually separated after
being together for about a year.

46:43.148 --> 46:45.498
Oh, so it was serious.

46:45.672 --> 46:47.021
- Well, I thought so.
- Mm-hmm.

46:47.195 --> 46:50.198
And we had the discussion
about having kids,

46:50.372 --> 46:53.898
and we decided to just end it.

46:57.292 --> 46:58.250
Well,

46:59.033 --> 47:00.034
that is a...

47:01.122 --> 47:03.255
That's a big relief. I'm really
relieved to hear that.

47:05.126 --> 47:06.171
Wait.

47:06.345 --> 47:07.215
Why?

47:09.870 --> 47:11.132
Well, um...

47:12.742 --> 47:15.136
Okay. So based
on our conversation from the other night...

47:16.746 --> 47:19.140
Whoa. All right. I just figured
I would get it off my chest.

47:21.229 --> 47:22.274
I had a vasectomy,

47:22.840 --> 47:25.886
like, two years ago. So...

47:28.628 --> 47:30.412
I mean, it's good
to be on the same page,

47:30.586 --> 47:33.198
assuming things
were to move forward,

47:33.372 --> 47:35.765
which hoping they do...

47:42.163 --> 47:43.164
Oh.

47:45.863 --> 47:47.647
Oh, you were the one
who wanted kids.

47:49.823 --> 47:51.303
What made you think otherwise?

47:54.175 --> 47:57.700
We cheers-ed our coffees.

47:58.832 --> 48:01.313
We talked about helping
a lot of kids.

48:02.923 --> 48:05.970
Sorry, I just-- I was completely
under the impression--

48:06.144 --> 48:08.407
So you never want kids
since we're assuming things from our date?

48:08.581 --> 48:09.930
Okay. Can we slow down? Right?

48:10.104 --> 48:12.193
'Cause this is happening
really fast.

48:12.367 --> 48:13.760
- Well?
- No.

48:17.111 --> 48:18.156
Then no.

48:19.809 --> 48:21.724
I like my life how it is.

48:25.032 --> 48:27.295
And who would be stupid enough
to bring a kid into this world anyway?

48:28.166 --> 48:29.776
So I'm stupid for wanting kids?

48:29.950 --> 48:33.911
No, I-- No,
I didn't mean that. I just...

48:34.912 --> 48:38.654
Daisy. I mean, we just had
our first date, and it was an impromptu one.

48:39.307 --> 48:40.656
Where is this coming from?

48:41.266 --> 48:43.659
It's coming from the fact
that I don't have time...

48:44.747 --> 48:46.662
...to figure out
what the hell it is that I want.

48:49.274 --> 48:50.492
I'd love to be with you
for a year.

48:50.666 --> 48:51.537
But then...

48:53.017 --> 48:54.061
...if I brought this up then...

48:58.196 --> 49:00.285
Dream world, it's you

49:00.938 --> 49:01.939
and a kid.

49:14.821 --> 49:17.302
You got a very
unorthodox sense of timing.

49:20.696 --> 49:22.785
We're old. We should be honest
with each other by now.

49:25.136 --> 49:26.180
We're not that old.

49:37.583 --> 49:41.195
I'm really sorry about
any misunderstanding, and I...

49:41.761 --> 49:44.242
I completely understand
where you're coming from.

49:45.112 --> 49:46.722
Stop being so nice.
You're making it worse.

49:46.896 --> 49:48.681
Just rational.

49:51.597 --> 49:53.512
- Business as usual.
- Of course.

49:56.645 --> 50:00.301
Hey, Mr. P, I got an idea
for my third piece. I'm going to change it up a bit.

50:00.475 --> 50:02.216
Cool. Oh, yeah, yeah.

50:02.390 --> 50:03.826
Hey, can't wait to see that.

50:04.523 --> 50:07.134
Is that sandwich spicy,
Miss Bea? You're tearing up.

50:07.917 --> 50:09.136
Super spicy.

50:14.272 --> 50:15.882
- Hey.
- Hey.

50:16.709 --> 50:18.711
Hey, guys.

50:21.931 --> 50:23.150
- Hey.
- Hey.

50:24.412 --> 50:25.631
Shit.

50:26.980 --> 50:30.201
- You have to go?
- I promise, I, I didn't plan it like this,

50:30.375 --> 50:32.464
but... yeah.

50:32.638 --> 50:34.509
- Okay. Go.
- I'm really sorry.

50:36.120 --> 50:37.164
I'm sorry.

50:49.959 --> 50:51.831
Um, Sadie, excuse me.

50:52.005 --> 50:53.224
What are you doing?

50:53.789 --> 50:55.965
So I just got transferred
to this class

50:56.140 --> 50:58.794
because, well, home ec sucks.

51:02.233 --> 51:03.408
Can I come inside?

51:05.236 --> 51:06.498
Uh...

51:09.892 --> 51:10.850
Cool.

51:12.852 --> 51:14.158
There has to be something
you can do, Dad.

51:14.332 --> 51:15.376
Don't call me that here.

51:15.550 --> 51:17.552
Oh, because it's such a secret.

51:18.162 --> 51:19.206
Let me be Frank.

51:19.728 --> 51:20.947
Sorry.

51:22.340 --> 51:25.038
This is kind of funny
because my name is Frank.

51:25.647 --> 51:26.605
I know, Dad.

51:27.867 --> 51:28.911
Sorry.

51:29.086 --> 51:30.478
My hands are tied, Daze.

51:30.652 --> 51:33.264
- She's a bully.
- No, she's a student.

51:33.438 --> 51:35.092
She tortures August and Maddie.

51:35.266 --> 51:37.311
Well, then, it's your duty
as a teacher

51:37.485 --> 51:39.792
to mold her into
a compassionate human being.

51:39.966 --> 51:43.143
- Me?
- Yes, you, Jack, whoever else is helping.

51:43.317 --> 51:44.840
Jack had to step out
for the day.

51:46.015 --> 51:48.279
Then, quick question.

51:48.453 --> 51:50.890
- Yeah.
- Who's watching your kids?

51:52.718 --> 51:55.155
Oh. Oh, uh...

51:57.766 --> 51:59.116
You're not an artist.
You're an idiot.

51:59.290 --> 52:01.248
Say that to my 5,000 followers.

52:02.249 --> 52:03.424
Hi, all. I'm--

52:05.557 --> 52:08.473
- Excuse me?
- Go hike up your skirt for another five likes.

52:08.647 --> 52:11.867
- Maddie.
- I mean, I would, but Daisy's got my phone.

52:12.041 --> 52:13.956
Good. Maybe you can
use your brain for once.

52:14.131 --> 52:16.481
Okay, everybody just stop!
Go back to your projects.

52:19.919 --> 52:20.963
Well, what about me?

52:25.446 --> 52:26.969
What about you, Sadie?

52:34.890 --> 52:37.328
Lord, please bless this food
to the nourishment of our body.

52:37.502 --> 52:39.025
Please watch over Mom,

52:39.199 --> 52:40.548
or please help
Daddy find his teeth.

52:40.722 --> 52:41.680
Amen.

52:45.162 --> 52:46.163
So, um...

52:47.338 --> 52:48.774
...your mom tells me
you're trying to get pregnant.

52:51.037 --> 52:53.561
- Oh, Lordy! Are you okay?
- Stanley, you goof.

52:53.735 --> 52:55.259
Sorry. Sit. Don't get up.

52:55.433 --> 52:57.391
- Oh.
- I'm fine.

52:57.565 --> 53:00.960
I'm sorry.
I, I, I didn't mean-- - Stanley, stop it.

53:01.526 --> 53:04.224
If only most men
were so forthcoming.

53:04.398 --> 53:05.965
Mom, you're laying it on
a little thick.

53:06.661 --> 53:08.141
You told me to set this up.

53:10.274 --> 53:12.058
So, Stanley, quick question.

53:12.580 --> 53:14.887
Is there an office poll
for when I'll get knocked up?

53:16.671 --> 53:17.629
Well...

53:23.548 --> 53:25.854
Is she this
crazy at work? -

53:26.551 --> 53:29.075
Uh, sometimes. Yeah.

53:30.685 --> 53:32.252
I'm sorry she dragged you
into this.

53:32.426 --> 53:34.994
No, I got a good roast
out of it.

53:36.517 --> 53:37.823
I'm not good
at this kind of stuff.

53:37.997 --> 53:40.478
So I'm sorry
if I acted a fool in there.

53:40.652 --> 53:42.262
No, no, not at all.

53:42.871 --> 53:44.177
It's just, like,
you're real nice

53:44.351 --> 53:47.746
and, and pretty funny
and all, and...

53:48.442 --> 53:51.793
Yeah, I might not be the right
guy for you, but it's just...

53:52.620 --> 53:55.362
- I, I know I'm direct--
- That's great.

53:56.798 --> 53:57.756
Yeah?

54:00.062 --> 54:01.890
It's just-- You know,
I don't want to be 70

54:02.064 --> 54:03.892
when my kid
graduates high school.

54:04.589 --> 54:06.808
Um, could, could
I call you sometime?

54:08.157 --> 54:09.246
Yeah.

54:13.337 --> 54:16.514
Let's take it slow.
We don't have to jump in bed right this minute.

54:16.688 --> 54:19.865
Yeah. I wouldn't know
what to do if we did.

54:22.128 --> 54:23.085
I'm kidding.

54:23.782 --> 54:26.045
I've totally had
intercourse before.

54:41.800 --> 54:42.801
Hey.

54:43.845 --> 54:48.110
I know today was kind of
a weird one, but, uh...

54:49.111 --> 54:51.636
...can we straighten
a couple things out? - Sure.

54:52.724 --> 54:53.638
Okay.

54:55.248 --> 54:56.205
You and me,

54:56.858 --> 54:59.861
we do not always see
eye to eye on everything.

55:00.558 --> 55:03.169
But I think that we had,

55:03.343 --> 55:07.216
or have, a real connection.

55:08.217 --> 55:10.307
- It's effortless and--
- Hey, Daisy!

55:12.918 --> 55:14.180
Late lunch for milady.

55:14.354 --> 55:16.487
- Oh, thank you.
- Mm.

55:18.489 --> 55:20.708
Uh, yeah. I'm sorry.
I should be going.

55:21.318 --> 55:22.536
Wait. Are you sure?

55:23.407 --> 55:25.104
Yeah.

55:25.626 --> 55:28.977
Well, don't forget
we have that meeting at the venue after school.

55:29.151 --> 55:32.633
So I will, in fact,
see you later.

55:33.286 --> 55:34.156
Great.

55:38.552 --> 55:39.945
- Uh, you're a lifesaver.
- Mm.

55:40.119 --> 55:41.990
Yeah. What's, uh, what's this?

55:42.556 --> 55:44.079
No idea.

56:04.448 --> 56:05.666
So...

56:06.841 --> 56:09.801
...I will need a deposit on the
space no later than the seventh.

56:09.975 --> 56:13.370
It's a popular spot
for Christmas parties.

56:13.544 --> 56:16.764
You all are able to load
in the dock out back the night before.

56:16.938 --> 56:18.897
However, I will need
everything out

56:19.071 --> 56:21.073
by 8:00 a.m.
the next morning. Right?

56:21.247 --> 56:23.031
I will give you all a minute.

56:30.038 --> 56:31.605
So what's with the photograph?

56:32.911 --> 56:34.042
You seemed to like it.

56:34.869 --> 56:36.567
I did. Thanks.

56:37.655 --> 56:39.308
Then you like my dream.

56:42.964 --> 56:47.752
Sorry. Uh, Hannah,
can we just get, like, a quick moment alone?

56:50.015 --> 56:53.714
Sure. Uh, my daughter will be
here at seven and then I...

56:53.888 --> 56:55.150
We'll need to leave.

57:00.417 --> 57:03.115
It was right after Angola,

57:03.855 --> 57:04.769
the vasectomy.

57:05.987 --> 57:06.901
Hm.

57:08.033 --> 57:09.861
If I had a kid of my own,

57:10.035 --> 57:13.168
I know that I would love
that kid so damn much

57:13.342 --> 57:16.171
that I wouldn't be able
to focus on anything else except parenting.

57:16.345 --> 57:18.826
Oh, I see a whirlwind.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.262
Maybe you could do both.

57:21.002 --> 57:23.048
I want to help
thousands of kids over my life.

57:23.918 --> 57:26.094
I know that's not
traditional, but...

57:27.313 --> 57:28.793
...if I could give
that many children

57:28.967 --> 57:31.752
just, like, a sliver
of joy, of hope.

57:32.492 --> 57:33.667
Well, then, that's my dream.

57:35.103 --> 57:36.844
And I meant what
I told you in the library.

57:37.018 --> 57:39.238
I see something
really special with you.

57:41.501 --> 57:44.417
Look, I don't want to be
unfair to your dream.

57:46.724 --> 57:49.291
It's just, for now,
it's too difficult.

57:50.031 --> 57:52.251
Being around you,
knowing all of this...

57:53.644 --> 57:55.428
...that I'm special to you,
it's just...

57:59.345 --> 58:02.261
Okay, so, what do we do?

58:03.567 --> 58:05.090
You've done so much
for these kids already,

58:05.264 --> 58:07.745
so you can just go help
the next ones.

58:09.486 --> 58:10.661
Well-- No, what do you mean?

58:11.226 --> 58:13.228
No, I'm going
to follow through on this.

58:13.402 --> 58:15.840
Plus, you have no idea how
to put on a show by yourself.

58:17.058 --> 58:18.669
Maybe that's good.

58:18.843 --> 58:20.671
Maybe I'll bring a new
perspective to the art scene.

58:23.412 --> 58:25.327
Keep an eye out
for the invite. Okay?

58:25.893 --> 58:28.113
I'd love to see you here. Sincerely.

58:30.245 --> 58:31.769
I know how I'm coming off.

58:31.943 --> 58:33.988
It's just what I need right now.

58:36.991 --> 58:38.993
You got a real knack
for ending things, huh?

58:55.836 --> 58:57.229
Mom, I'm here.

59:10.590 --> 59:11.896
Jack is our ace
in the hole, Miss Bea.

59:12.070 --> 59:13.375
How are we going to do this
without him?

59:13.550 --> 59:15.073
Everyone just calm down!

59:15.247 --> 59:16.727
Yeah. I mean, we worked
our tails off for this,

59:16.901 --> 59:18.206
and he just cuts and runs?

59:18.380 --> 59:19.817
It's not like that.
It's not on him.

59:19.991 --> 59:21.035
It's on me. Okay?

59:22.123 --> 59:24.299
And why exactly is it on you, Miss Bea?

59:27.476 --> 59:28.477
What?

59:44.581 --> 59:45.886
Thanks for sitting here with me.

59:46.365 --> 59:47.714
Silence is really nice.

59:47.888 --> 59:49.455
A lot of noise
in my life lately.

59:50.195 --> 59:52.850
- Mm.
- You know you're killing it, right?

59:53.024 --> 59:55.461
Thanks.
You're really kind.

59:56.288 --> 59:58.507
I saw your dance video.
It's so good.

59:58.682 --> 01:00:01.032
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah. Ah.

01:00:01.206 --> 01:00:02.773
Oh.

01:00:02.947 --> 01:00:04.035
Our venue.

01:00:05.471 --> 01:00:07.168
- Hey, Miss George, what's up?
- <i>Daisy.</i>

01:00:07.342 --> 01:00:09.518
Hi. Look, I just wanted
to give you a quick call

01:00:09.693 --> 01:00:11.912
to let you know that the
gallery, it was already booked

01:00:12.086 --> 01:00:16.003
<i>- on the day
that you had reserved it.</i> - I, I'm sorry. What?

01:00:16.177 --> 01:00:19.006
Yeah. Unfortunately,
it's just not going to work out the way we hoped.

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:21.182
Oh, no, no, no.
You can't do this right now.

01:00:21.356 --> 01:00:24.795
No, no. Don't you worry your
pretty little head about it.

01:00:24.969 --> 01:00:27.841
I will have
that deposit back to you ASAP.

01:00:28.015 --> 01:00:31.279
I don't want my deposit back.
I want the space for the show, like we discussed.

01:00:31.758 --> 01:00:33.542
I mean, the kids, they're
really depending on this.

01:00:33.717 --> 01:00:35.153
I am sorry.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:37.155
That is just not possible.

01:00:37.329 --> 01:00:39.853
Well, what about
some other date?

01:00:40.027 --> 01:00:41.333
Like, anything other--

01:00:41.507 --> 01:00:43.161
You know, I've got
another call buzzing in,

01:00:43.335 --> 01:00:46.164
but I'm so glad
that we could work this out.

01:00:46.338 --> 01:00:47.731
Work what out?

01:00:47.905 --> 01:00:50.168
Thank you so much
for understanding. Namaste.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:05.313
Hm. That little brat.

01:01:05.966 --> 01:01:07.098
What happened?

01:01:14.018 --> 01:01:17.543
Yeah. Hi.
I was wondering if you have any availability in December?

01:01:17.717 --> 01:01:19.937
The entire month is full?

01:01:20.938 --> 01:01:21.852
Wow.

01:01:22.853 --> 01:01:25.377
No, there won't be
any open flames.

01:01:25.551 --> 01:01:27.509
Alcohol? No, it's a kids' show.

01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:29.642
That's just the insurance cost?
That's--

01:01:29.816 --> 01:01:31.426
A little over our budget.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.645
Never mind.

01:01:36.518 --> 01:01:37.432
Uh-huh.

01:01:38.999 --> 01:01:40.827
Are you actually laughing at me?

01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:45.049
It's a high school art show,
and our other venue bailed, so--

01:01:45.223 --> 01:01:46.137
No, I...

01:01:46.311 --> 01:01:47.921
Please? There has to be.

01:01:48.095 --> 01:01:49.488
They're kids!

01:01:49.662 --> 01:01:51.708
And goodbye to you too!

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.368
Any luck?

01:02:00.542 --> 01:02:02.240
No.
Everyone's either blocked or--

01:02:02.414 --> 01:02:03.632
Way too expensive?

01:02:03.807 --> 01:02:05.417
Yeah, same here.

01:02:06.418 --> 01:02:07.898
We'll figure it out, Daze.

01:02:09.073 --> 01:02:10.988
Yeah, Thanks so much
for your help.

01:02:15.601 --> 01:02:16.645
Oh.

01:02:17.821 --> 01:02:20.562
Miss Bea, uh, you all right?

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:24.828
Yeah, I'm fine. I, I just hit
a tiny little bump in the road.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.481
what happened?

01:02:27.265 --> 01:02:29.223
Well, we lost our venue.

01:02:29.397 --> 01:02:30.877
It's double-booked.

01:02:31.051 --> 01:02:33.184
What? That venue
was our ace in the hole.

01:02:33.358 --> 01:02:35.229
You said that Jack
was your ace in the hole.

01:02:35.403 --> 01:02:37.841
Yeah, well, I thought
we lived in a world

01:02:38.015 --> 01:02:40.539
where there could be two aces
in one hole. -

01:02:41.366 --> 01:02:42.759
What are we gonna do now?

01:02:43.411 --> 01:02:46.284
Uh, well,
we'll keep calling places.

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:47.851
Ask around.

01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:49.635
You sure that'll work?

01:02:50.331 --> 01:02:51.637
Yeah, of course.

01:03:10.743 --> 01:03:13.441
I learned today that teaching
nine kids is pure hell. -

01:03:13.615 --> 01:03:16.618
You're living the dream
compared to other teachers. - Mm.

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:19.491
You could only have
to worry about one.

01:03:19.665 --> 01:03:20.753
Just saying.

01:03:22.973 --> 01:03:25.802
Remind me, Mom,
where do you stand on the whole me-getting-pregnant thing?

01:03:25.976 --> 01:03:26.846
I forgot.

01:03:29.544 --> 01:03:31.111
You miss the library full-time?

01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:32.939
I do a little. It was simple.

01:03:34.201 --> 01:03:35.681
Life is good when it's simple.

01:03:36.377 --> 01:03:37.639
Took me a while to learn that.

01:04:17.201 --> 01:04:19.768
Okay. Consider this
a trial run, Stanley.

01:04:19.943 --> 01:04:21.379
Just to gauge. Okay?

01:04:22.075 --> 01:04:23.424
Just some checkpoint questions.

01:04:23.598 --> 01:04:25.383
Do you drink?

01:04:26.079 --> 01:04:27.951
Uh, not much, no, uh...

01:04:28.516 --> 01:04:30.605
Occasional shot of Boone's Farm
to take the edge off.

01:04:30.779 --> 01:04:32.259
And how's your count?

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:33.782
Huh?

01:04:34.696 --> 01:04:35.741
Sperm?

01:04:35.915 --> 01:04:37.047
Oh, uh...

01:04:38.918 --> 01:04:40.398
It's all there, I think.

01:04:41.312 --> 01:04:42.661
And do you secretly smoke?

01:04:43.444 --> 01:04:44.576
Never once.

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:45.751
Hm.

01:04:50.538 --> 01:04:51.888
Oh. Uh...

01:04:57.415 --> 01:04:58.372
What?

01:05:00.157 --> 01:05:01.332
Nothing.

01:05:02.463 --> 01:05:03.377
What?

01:05:05.945 --> 01:05:07.294
I've never done
this before, Daisy.

01:05:08.469 --> 01:05:11.124
Wait. Really?
I, I thought you said you had.

01:05:17.565 --> 01:05:19.524
Well, are you okay?

01:05:20.307 --> 01:05:22.701
Oh, it's-- Well,
you know, when you said

01:05:22.875 --> 01:05:24.529
you didn't want to hop into bed
this instant,

01:05:24.703 --> 01:05:27.401
I, I, I just didn't think
it'd be this soon. But--

01:05:27.575 --> 01:05:28.925
- We can wait.
- No.

01:05:32.145 --> 01:05:33.581
Let's do this thing.

01:05:34.147 --> 01:05:35.105
Okay.

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:42.851
Okay. Wh-- What do I do next?

01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:47.552
Phew!

01:05:49.293 --> 01:05:51.469
Well, goodnight, Stanley.

01:05:51.643 --> 01:05:52.818
Goodnight, Daisy.

01:05:54.385 --> 01:05:55.473
Thank you.

01:05:57.562 --> 01:06:00.521
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:06:02.175 --> 01:06:04.961
Oh, my God!

01:06:06.353 --> 01:06:08.138
That felt great.

01:06:11.358 --> 01:06:13.273
- Don't look at me like that.
- Like what?

01:06:13.447 --> 01:06:14.753
He's nice.

01:06:15.319 --> 01:06:18.278
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.

01:06:18.452 --> 01:06:21.238
I miss when you were just
a librarian. I can't keep up.

01:06:21.934 --> 01:06:24.067
- Me neither.
- Just think.

01:06:24.241 --> 01:06:26.504
He'll remember last night
for the rest of his life.

01:06:27.418 --> 01:06:29.028
Which is halfway over.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.860
Maybe you just needed to do this

01:06:35.034 --> 01:06:37.645
so you could realize
that you really want Jack.

01:06:38.646 --> 01:06:40.561
Yeah, maybe.

01:06:40.735 --> 01:06:42.346
Yeah. Let's just hope

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:45.131
old Stanley boy didn't get you
preggers in the meantime.

01:06:48.308 --> 01:06:50.658
Oh, my God, I was just kidding.

01:06:52.443 --> 01:06:53.922
You used protection, right?

01:06:54.923 --> 01:06:56.838
Listen, I, I think
I need a favor.

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:59.319
I, I forgot. I have
a doctor's appointment today.

01:06:59.493 --> 01:07:00.625
Okay.

01:07:02.279 --> 01:07:04.977
I need you to go to school
and be with the kids right after lunch.

01:07:05.978 --> 01:07:08.154
And keep th-- keep thinking
of venues we can call,

01:07:08.328 --> 01:07:09.373
you know, for the show.

01:07:11.331 --> 01:07:13.377
What? Daze?

01:07:47.628 --> 01:07:49.021
Just breathe, Miss Bea.

01:07:49.543 --> 01:07:51.110
We'll get you sorted out. Okay?

01:07:58.683 --> 01:08:00.119
Okay. Yeah. Come in.

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:03.601
Hi. Are you Daisy?

01:08:05.603 --> 01:08:08.084
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Dr. Upadhya.

01:08:08.258 --> 01:08:10.042
Thanks for coming
to see me today.

01:08:10.216 --> 01:08:11.783
Okay, look, if I have cancer,

01:08:11.957 --> 01:08:13.915
just rip the band aid off
and tell it to me straight.

01:08:14.916 --> 01:08:15.787
You don't have cancer.

01:08:15.961 --> 01:08:17.441
I knew it.

01:08:17.615 --> 01:08:19.182
No, you don't have cancer.

01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:23.664
Oh, good. Thank God.

01:08:24.187 --> 01:08:25.579
I did look at your lab results.

01:08:25.753 --> 01:08:27.146
Your urine analysis was normal.

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.540
Your pregnancy test
was negative.

01:08:29.714 --> 01:08:31.237
On your pelvic ultrasound, though,

01:08:31.411 --> 01:08:34.197
you did have uterine fibroids
and ovarian cysts.

01:08:34.806 --> 01:08:36.895
Given that you came in
in so much pain,

01:08:37.069 --> 01:08:38.853
we can't rule out endometriosis.

01:08:39.463 --> 01:08:41.465
Good thing I know
what all that is.

01:08:41.639 --> 01:08:44.685
It's a fairly common condition,
and until we know for sure,

01:08:44.859 --> 01:08:46.122
I can manage it
with some pain meds

01:08:46.296 --> 01:08:47.862
which we can send
to your pharmacy.

01:08:48.689 --> 01:08:50.474
But the thing I wanted
to talk to you about was,

01:08:50.648 --> 01:08:52.258
I noted in your history,

01:08:52.432 --> 01:08:54.130
you've never
been pregnant before?

01:08:56.001 --> 01:08:56.871
Okay.

01:08:57.829 --> 01:09:00.832
Um, is that something
that you're interested in

01:09:01.006 --> 01:09:02.399
or concerned about?

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:04.052
Yes.

01:09:04.792 --> 01:09:06.490
Wait. Yes.

01:09:07.230 --> 01:09:08.492
Will I be able to?

01:09:09.188 --> 01:09:10.929
I honestly can't tell you
for sure right now.

01:09:11.103 --> 01:09:12.931
I'd have to refer you
to a specialist.

01:09:13.105 --> 01:09:14.976
The way
they diagnose endometriosis

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:17.196
is through
a laparoscopic surgery.

01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:19.459
But if you're interested
in knowing your fertility,

01:09:19.633 --> 01:09:21.244
we can work that up
in a number of ways.

01:09:21.418 --> 01:09:23.594
Oh.

01:09:23.768 --> 01:09:25.944
This is a lot.

01:09:26.901 --> 01:09:31.210
I know. Um, to be blunt
with you, Daisy,

01:09:31.384 --> 01:09:33.125
given your advanced
maternal age,

01:09:33.299 --> 01:09:34.866
the odds aren't exactly
in your favor.

01:09:35.954 --> 01:09:36.868
For what?

01:09:37.651 --> 01:09:39.305
So you're almost forty.

01:09:40.437 --> 01:09:44.092
A man, he can have a baby
when he's 30, 40, 80.

01:09:44.267 --> 01:09:47.444
- Right.
- Women, we're screwed.

01:09:47.618 --> 01:09:49.141
Once we hit 35,

01:09:49.315 --> 01:09:51.970
we're what's known
as an elderly primigravida.

01:09:52.144 --> 01:09:54.886
- Elderly?
- I know. It's gross.

01:09:55.365 --> 01:09:57.889
But basically,
it means once we hit that age,

01:09:58.063 --> 01:10:00.065
the odds of having
a viable pregnancy

01:10:00.239 --> 01:10:01.501
drop significantly.

01:10:02.067 --> 01:10:03.460
So it's not impossible,

01:10:03.634 --> 01:10:06.071
but we really need
to gauge your priorities.

01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:11.337
I have so many questions.

01:10:11.511 --> 01:10:12.860
Okay, take your time.

01:10:14.035 --> 01:10:16.516
If I have endometriosis,

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:18.562
what are my options?

01:10:19.345 --> 01:10:22.435
If it's a mild case,
they often recommend a surveillance approach.

01:10:23.088 --> 01:10:25.525
Everything you say sounds
like <i>Star Trek</i> to me.

01:10:25.699 --> 01:10:27.527
Okay. I'm sorry.

01:10:27.701 --> 01:10:30.574
Basically, it means watch,
wait and see.

01:10:30.748 --> 01:10:32.053
If it's a moderate case,

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:34.012
they recommend
endometrial ablation

01:10:34.186 --> 01:10:35.796
or hormone injections.

01:10:36.884 --> 01:10:40.584
If it's a severe case, it often
requires a hysterectomy.

01:10:42.063 --> 01:10:44.240
I don't want to scare you,
but I really think

01:10:44.414 --> 01:10:47.199
we should prepare ourselves for
the worst case scenario here.

01:10:49.114 --> 01:10:50.768
<i>You're ruining the class</i>

01:10:50.942 --> 01:10:52.160
for all of us.

01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:54.250
Okay, okay.
Everybody, calm down.

01:10:54.424 --> 01:10:57.383
- Calm down?
- It's Sadie's stupid fault we don't have a venue

01:10:57.557 --> 01:10:59.342
because she went
whining to Mommy.

01:10:59.516 --> 01:11:00.995
- We don't know that.
- Yes, we do.

01:11:01.169 --> 01:11:03.128
We called the venue like
we were potential customers.

01:11:03.302 --> 01:11:06.305
There's nothing booked on those
days. It was completely free.

01:11:06.479 --> 01:11:08.176
And then we realized,
"Oh, it's her mom."

01:11:09.439 --> 01:11:11.615
Well, that's actually
pretty good detective work.

01:11:19.753 --> 01:11:21.886
- You bitch!
- What? You're going to cry now?

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:24.541
- Okay, stop it.
- You ruined everything, Sadie.

01:11:24.715 --> 01:11:26.456
What the hell do you have
against us? - Hey!

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:28.936
What's with all the noise?

01:11:29.502 --> 01:11:31.765
Everything stops this instant.

01:11:36.117 --> 01:11:38.424
I don't think I can do
the show anywhere, Mr. Bea.

01:11:39.033 --> 01:11:41.297
What? Daze, what's wrong?

01:11:41.471 --> 01:11:42.646
How did the doctor go?

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:44.169
Are you kidding, Miss Bea?

01:11:44.822 --> 01:11:46.127
You're our third
ace in the hole.

01:11:46.954 --> 01:11:48.652
You really need to find
a different metaphor.

01:11:48.826 --> 01:11:50.436
Until further notice, I'm out.

01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:52.003
Eden, you take care
of everything.

01:11:52.177 --> 01:11:53.526
Dad, you do it, or--

01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:56.007
Kids, I don't care.

01:11:57.661 --> 01:11:59.227
Miss Bea,
you can't give up on us.

01:11:59.706 --> 01:12:01.186
I know that
it's been stressful--

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.493
- If she wants to go, let her go.
- Shut up, Sadie.

01:12:03.667 --> 01:12:06.757
Okay, look,
it's been a long day, okay?

01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:08.498
Just go home. Get some rest.

01:12:09.803 --> 01:12:12.458
You were the only one
that made this fun, Miss Bea.

01:12:13.503 --> 01:12:14.417
Please?

01:12:23.817 --> 01:12:25.515
Whoever did that to her work...

01:12:27.168 --> 01:12:28.344
...you're better than that.

01:12:44.925 --> 01:12:45.839
Daze.

01:12:49.147 --> 01:12:50.409
Daze, Daze.

01:12:51.062 --> 01:12:52.106
Hold up a second.

01:12:54.848 --> 01:12:55.762
Listen...

01:12:56.850 --> 01:12:58.678
...I know you're going
through a lot right now,

01:12:58.852 --> 01:13:00.593
I mean, with, with the kids,

01:13:00.767 --> 01:13:03.030
uh, your mother, the, the show.

01:13:03.204 --> 01:13:05.511
But, well, listen,
you can't just say,

01:13:05.685 --> 01:13:07.078
"Hey, Eden, cover for me."

01:13:07.252 --> 01:13:08.906
I mean, she's not
a registered sub.

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.473
I can get in some
serious trouble, you know?

01:13:10.647 --> 01:13:12.518
I know, I'm sorry. It's just...

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:15.652
- We lost our venue and--
- W-- Wait, Wait.

01:13:15.826 --> 01:13:17.393
- What? When did this happen?
- It doesn't matter.

01:13:17.567 --> 01:13:19.177
I've called everywhere.
Everything's booked.

01:13:19.351 --> 01:13:21.571
Okay. Okay.

01:13:21.745 --> 01:13:25.618
Well-- So what?
I mean, you don't have to have some fancy gallery, Daze.

01:13:25.792 --> 01:13:27.141
I'm sure we'll find something.

01:13:27.881 --> 01:13:30.623
It's art.
I mean, hell, you could hang it

01:13:30.797 --> 01:13:32.103
from the trees
in the Garden District

01:13:32.277 --> 01:13:34.497
or, or burn it
in a bonfire at Dubai.

01:13:34.671 --> 01:13:36.542
- You could be very avant-garde.
- Dad.

01:13:36.716 --> 01:13:38.762
All right. What about Jack?

01:13:38.936 --> 01:13:40.546
- We could use his studio.
- No, Dad.

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:43.680
Whatever. Just don't let this
be an excuse to quit.

01:13:44.289 --> 01:13:46.291
All right? Those kids
are counting on you.

01:13:47.684 --> 01:13:49.512
So let's buck up,

01:13:49.686 --> 01:13:52.036
figure this thing out
and finish what you started.

01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:54.560
Dad, it's not just that.

01:13:56.954 --> 01:13:58.085
Kiddo, what?

01:14:00.087 --> 01:14:01.785
What-- Oh.

01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:19.846
You should've
seen her today, Cammie.

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:22.458
She just seemed so defeated.

01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:28.855
Well, she can
still freeze her eggs.

01:14:29.029 --> 01:14:30.466
All is not lost.

01:14:31.336 --> 01:14:32.772
You're not going to bring
that up again now, are you?

01:14:33.773 --> 01:14:34.992
I'm just saying.

01:14:38.125 --> 01:14:39.605
Let me give you
a little information.

01:14:41.389 --> 01:14:45.437
Your daughter is doing
a fantastic job with those kids,

01:14:45.611 --> 01:14:48.788
and I can't recall the last time
I've, I've seen her so excited

01:14:48.962 --> 01:14:50.703
or lively about anything.

01:14:51.704 --> 01:14:53.010
She's been happy.

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:56.317
Hell, the only time
I see her stressed or anxious

01:14:56.883 --> 01:14:58.232
is when you're hounding her.

01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:02.541
I mean, shouldn't, shouldn't
it be your goal as a mother

01:15:03.107 --> 01:15:04.674
to see your daughter happy?

01:15:08.721 --> 01:15:10.288
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

01:15:11.594 --> 01:15:12.812
I'm going to support her.

01:15:13.683 --> 01:15:16.686
Because our daughter
is doing something great.

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:19.558
And I couldn't be
more proud of her.

01:15:29.568 --> 01:15:31.614
<i>Hey, you've reached Jack. Sorry I missed you.</i>

01:15:31.788 --> 01:15:33.920
<i>You can leave me a message,
and I'll call you back.</i>

01:15:34.094 --> 01:15:36.880
Hey, Jack. Hi. It's Daisy. Um...

01:15:37.445 --> 01:15:39.447
I know it's been a minute,
but I had something

01:15:39.622 --> 01:15:41.014
I really need
to talk to you about.

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:42.538
Give me a call.

01:15:43.582 --> 01:15:44.975
Uh, I hope you're well.

01:16:02.819 --> 01:16:03.776
Okay.

01:16:05.169 --> 01:16:07.519
We can do this. Yeah.

01:16:12.306 --> 01:16:14.700
Oh, Jack. Hey, I'm,
I'm at the school right now,

01:16:14.874 --> 01:16:17.050
but is there any way
that we could meet up in, like, 30 minutes?

01:16:17.224 --> 01:16:18.574
I have this huge favor
I need to a--

01:16:20.924 --> 01:16:21.838
What?

01:16:25.232 --> 01:16:26.190
What?

01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:33.589
This is...

01:16:34.415 --> 01:16:35.460
Oh, my gosh, Jack.

01:16:35.634 --> 01:16:36.853
Pretty wild, huh?

01:16:37.462 --> 01:16:39.725
- You are so lucky to be here.
- I know. I know.

01:16:43.381 --> 01:16:44.295
You know, Jack...

01:16:45.252 --> 01:16:47.298
...you have a real
unorthodox sense of timing.

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:52.869
Why didn't you call me?

01:16:53.696 --> 01:16:55.393
They're taking
good care of me here.

01:16:56.916 --> 01:16:58.483
And, you know,
with your show coming up,

01:16:58.657 --> 01:17:00.224
- I don't want to bother you.
- Hey, no.

01:17:00.398 --> 01:17:02.008
Our show?

01:17:03.053 --> 01:17:05.098
Yeah, but...

01:17:08.232 --> 01:17:11.365
Look, Jack, I'm so sorry
about everything.

01:17:11.539 --> 01:17:13.890
I know I've been
all over the place. And--

01:17:14.064 --> 01:17:15.195
Daze, you doing okay?

01:17:17.545 --> 01:17:19.460
No, no. Don't worry about me.

01:17:20.157 --> 01:17:21.332
I do though.

01:17:22.333 --> 01:17:25.945
I can't help but worry
about you, like, all the time.

01:17:28.382 --> 01:17:29.340
Daisy...

01:17:31.168 --> 01:17:32.386
...just talk to me.

01:17:37.783 --> 01:17:39.393
I don't think
kids are happening.

01:17:42.701 --> 01:17:45.225
But you getting
in the crash and...

01:17:46.313 --> 01:17:49.534
...being here now
looking like this...

01:17:50.578 --> 01:17:52.319
...maybe it's a sign
or something.

01:17:53.799 --> 01:17:54.887
I don't know.

01:17:56.933 --> 01:17:58.891
- Now you are talking crazy.
- Ah.

01:17:59.065 --> 01:18:00.327
Maybe I am, but...

01:18:01.372 --> 01:18:03.635
...I got two pieces
of horrible news today.

01:18:05.463 --> 01:18:07.552
And the thought of losing you
was the worst one.

01:18:09.902 --> 01:18:10.816
You know?

01:18:11.817 --> 01:18:12.949
Does that make sense?

01:18:15.212 --> 01:18:16.169
Well...

01:18:17.475 --> 01:18:21.087
...I'm happy that my pain
can be a sign for you. -

01:18:22.001 --> 01:18:24.264
Oh, my gosh, I'm sorry.
I just realized how that came off.

01:18:24.438 --> 01:18:25.788
- I'm not--
- I'm kidding.

01:18:28.355 --> 01:18:29.705
So what happens next?

01:18:30.488 --> 01:18:32.229
Do you...

01:18:32.403 --> 01:18:34.535
Wow, Jack, you look like shit.

01:18:35.754 --> 01:18:37.016
Hey, language!

01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:38.148
Sorry.

01:18:40.150 --> 01:18:41.412
Are you okay?

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:45.633
I mean, your wounds kind of
suit you.

01:18:45.808 --> 01:18:47.548
Oh, they do, huh?

01:18:48.114 --> 01:18:49.986
Well, I mean, it's,
It's kind of badass.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.683
Yes, I am fine.

01:18:51.857 --> 01:18:54.251
Guys, thank you.
Thank you for all these gifts.

01:18:54.425 --> 01:18:58.821
Yeah, uh, gift shop had, like,
the most basic options. So...

01:18:59.952 --> 01:19:00.779
Yeah.

01:19:03.477 --> 01:19:05.262
Well, it's the thought
that counts.

01:19:05.436 --> 01:19:06.611
Absolutely.

01:19:07.612 --> 01:19:10.267
So... how are you feeling?

01:19:10.441 --> 01:19:12.617
The show's right around
the corner. Tell me everything.

01:19:12.791 --> 01:19:13.792
You guys ready?

01:19:17.013 --> 01:19:19.798
- What, did I say something?
- Well...

01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:23.410
...we might have had,
like, a little, tiny hiccup.

01:19:23.584 --> 01:19:24.890
We had a catastrophic hiccup.

01:19:25.064 --> 01:19:26.413
We lost our venue.

01:19:27.066 --> 01:19:27.980
What?

01:19:28.676 --> 01:19:31.505
- How? Wait. What happened?
- Well...

01:19:32.506 --> 01:19:34.595
- ...it's complicated.
- It's my fault.

01:19:37.207 --> 01:19:38.556
I'm sorry.

01:19:39.644 --> 01:19:41.472
And the venue's
actually booked now.

01:19:41.646 --> 01:19:43.648
I begged my mom, but there was
nothing she could do.

01:19:45.084 --> 01:19:47.608
So why do you try
to sabotage us?

01:19:48.348 --> 01:19:49.393
I don't know.

01:19:50.002 --> 01:19:52.004
At first, I thought
it was a funny joke,

01:19:52.178 --> 01:19:55.268
but then I was standing
in the room full of people who hated me.

01:19:56.313 --> 01:19:58.619
Whatever. Here.

01:20:02.275 --> 01:20:04.800
The gift shop had
the most basic options. - Right?

01:20:09.239 --> 01:20:11.110
Mm. I'm sorry, guys.

01:20:11.719 --> 01:20:14.592
All is lost then...

01:20:14.766 --> 01:20:17.334
Nothing's going to be available
on such short notice.

01:20:17.987 --> 01:20:19.815
I'm sorry. You did your best.

01:20:21.381 --> 01:20:24.167
Or you could use my place.

01:20:25.908 --> 01:20:27.605
- Are you sure?
- Am I sure?

01:20:27.779 --> 01:20:30.129
- Yeah. Are you kidding?
- Oh, my God.

01:20:30.303 --> 01:20:31.914
I told you Jack
was our ace in the hole.

01:20:34.264 --> 01:20:36.657
Oh, we're back on, huh?
Pretty close.

01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:37.963
We're on.

01:20:39.443 --> 01:20:43.229
I'm going to go to school,
do a, a big e-mail blast, uh, print some flyers.

01:20:44.013 --> 01:20:45.231
I'm so proud of you.

We did it.

01:23:29.178 --> 01:23:30.483
Your work is so beautiful.

01:23:31.484 --> 01:23:32.790
I'm so proud of you,

01:23:33.356 --> 01:23:34.618
and I don't care
what happens tonight.

Just be proud, okay?

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:45.194
All right, let's mingle.

01:24:26.844 --> 01:24:28.889
Well, look who got creative.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:31.501
- Helen!
- Hi.

01:24:31.675 --> 01:24:34.634
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hoping to raise enough money to convince you to come back.

01:24:34.808 --> 01:24:36.375
Oh, no, my dear.

01:24:36.549 --> 01:24:38.247
I could never do this.

01:24:38.421 --> 01:24:39.552
This is you.

01:24:39.726 --> 01:24:41.119
You and your team.

01:24:41.685 --> 01:24:43.991
Your passion.
Your purpose, Daisy.

01:24:44.514 --> 01:24:45.776
I'm just an old crone.

01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:47.473
Oh, stop!

01:24:48.692 --> 01:24:51.608
Miss Bonneville! - Hi! Hey!

01:24:51.782 --> 01:24:54.001
- We have to show you our stuff.
- Oh, I'd love to see it.

01:24:54.176 --> 01:24:56.221
- Thank you for coming.
- Well done to you.

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:07.363
Daisy, what a turnout!
I can't believe this. Look.

01:25:08.059 --> 01:25:10.453
Those are the principals
from some of the Magnet Schools.

01:25:10.627 --> 01:25:13.151
- Oh, that's amazing.
- You did that.

01:25:13.847 --> 01:25:16.546
- You did that.
- Aw.

01:25:29.863 --> 01:25:31.082
It's so, uh...

01:25:32.301 --> 01:25:33.693
...poetic.

01:25:34.651 --> 01:25:35.956
I choreographed it.

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:37.828
Oh, did you now?

01:25:38.568 --> 01:25:40.309
Of course.

01:25:40.483 --> 01:25:41.919
Yeah, you did.

01:25:43.181 --> 01:25:44.356
- Mm.
- Hey, guys.

01:25:44.530 --> 01:25:45.531
Oh, hey, Daisy.

01:25:46.576 --> 01:25:48.186
We're having a great time.
This is awesome.

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:50.057
Cool.

01:25:57.587 --> 01:25:59.763
- You looked so good.
- Oh, thank you.

01:26:09.076 --> 01:26:10.426
He looks like trouble.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:11.992
You want me to get rid of him?

01:26:12.993 --> 01:26:14.169
Look at you.

01:26:17.868 --> 01:26:19.870
Ouch. Yeah.

01:26:20.044 --> 01:26:21.480
You saved us. Thank you.

01:26:21.654 --> 01:26:23.787
Daisy, I gave you a key.

01:26:24.701 --> 01:26:27.617
Hey, Miss Bea,
I think we should do it.

01:26:27.791 --> 01:26:30.054
Yeah, like, right now.

01:26:30.228 --> 01:26:32.143
You ready?

01:26:33.927 --> 01:26:35.146
We're not done yet.

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.365
Bring it on.

01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:40.847
Everybody, quiet down.

01:26:41.021 --> 01:26:43.067
Thank you. Come this way.

01:26:46.984 --> 01:26:50.466
I want to thank you all
for coming out for the inaugural West High School Art gala

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:52.468
hosted by none other
than Jack Palmer.

01:26:59.779 --> 01:27:02.304
The students' final piece
is called <i>We're not done yet.</i>

01:27:02.478 --> 01:27:04.915
It was created by
the entire art class as a unit,

01:27:05.089 --> 01:27:07.222
cobbled together
from things forgotten.

01:27:07.918 --> 01:27:08.875
We hope you get it.

01:27:27.633 --> 01:27:30.680
With your support, we would love
to add more creative minds.

01:27:30.854 --> 01:27:33.596
But even without it,
well, we'll find a way.

01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:35.815
So, uh, no pressure.

01:27:36.947 --> 01:27:40.472
Wait, wait.
We need to thank our mentors.

01:27:41.212 --> 01:27:44.302
Mr. Palmer, thank you
for letting us use your studio,

01:27:44.476 --> 01:27:47.436
and of course, for
your knowledge behind the lens.

01:27:47.610 --> 01:27:49.829
Ah. Give me a bump. Phew.

01:27:54.181 --> 01:27:57.402
And a big thanks to Miss Eden
for your free-flowing spirit.

01:27:57.576 --> 01:27:59.665
Aw!

01:27:59.839 --> 01:28:00.927
Thank you.

01:28:03.452 --> 01:28:06.106
But of course, of course,

01:28:06.716 --> 01:28:09.936
the biggest thanks of all
has to go to... - Miss Bea.

01:28:10.763 --> 01:28:12.504
Thank you for believing in us.

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.724
And never giving up on us.

01:28:14.898 --> 01:28:16.682
We don't know what
we would've done without you.

01:28:17.335 --> 01:28:18.423
Thanks, guys.

01:28:19.511 --> 01:28:21.644
Come on.

01:28:46.016 --> 01:28:47.104
Oh!

01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:52.631
- Drive safe.
- Of course.

01:28:53.937 --> 01:28:56.026
And no texting.

01:28:58.158 --> 01:28:59.638
Hey, Jack, are we still on
for tomorrow?

01:28:59.812 --> 01:29:02.119
Yeah. Four o'clock.
Bring that Pentax.

01:29:02.293 --> 01:29:03.381
Yeah.

01:29:04.687 --> 01:29:06.297
Aw, thanks so much
for coming, guys.

01:29:06.471 --> 01:29:07.951
- It was fun, Miss Bea.
- Oh, good.

01:29:08.125 --> 01:29:09.518
Yeah. Your new place is awesome.

01:29:09.692 --> 01:29:10.562
Oh, thanks.

01:29:12.564 --> 01:29:13.478
Bye.

01:29:14.436 --> 01:29:16.133
Wow.

01:29:16.786 --> 01:29:18.222
Stragglers, am I right?

01:29:18.396 --> 01:29:19.919
Come on.

01:29:25.621 --> 01:29:26.448
Bye, guys.

01:29:27.753 --> 01:29:28.972
- Happy birthday!
- Bye.

01:29:32.236 --> 01:29:33.759
- Do you want to sit?
- Oh, sure.

01:29:33.933 --> 01:29:35.021
Yeah.

01:29:35.587 --> 01:29:37.415
Careful.

01:29:38.547 --> 01:29:40.026
Feeling okay? You need anything?

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:41.245
I'm good.

01:29:42.246 --> 01:29:44.422
A little sore,
but I'm on the up and up.

01:29:44.596 --> 01:29:45.597
Hmm.

01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:49.296
Well, first birthday party

01:29:49.471 --> 01:29:51.386
in the new house. Check.

01:29:51.951 --> 01:29:54.519
First glass of wine
on the front steps. - Check!

01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:58.131
What else is on the docket?

01:29:59.394 --> 01:30:00.786
I got a few little things.

01:30:01.526 --> 01:30:03.049
Practice exam,

01:30:03.223 --> 01:30:04.834
- certification.
- Wait.

01:30:05.965 --> 01:30:08.185
Are you telling me that
you're not yet a legal teacher?

01:30:08.359 --> 01:30:09.839
More art shows...

01:30:11.971 --> 01:30:14.191
...probably a bunch of
teenage angst before summer.

01:30:16.106 --> 01:30:17.063
So much to do.

01:30:17.977 --> 01:30:19.326
So little time.

01:30:20.632 --> 01:30:22.025
We have plenty of time.

01:30:26.290 --> 01:30:27.813
But there is one thing
that can't wait.

01:30:27.987 --> 01:30:29.162
Oh, yeah?

01:30:31.034 --> 01:30:32.601
We've got to get on those weeds
in the back.

01:30:32.775 --> 01:30:34.559
- No!
- Yes.

01:30:34.733 --> 01:30:36.779
No. No way.

01:30:36.953 --> 01:30:38.345
Can we just ask
your mom to do that?

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.478
No. She'll tell us
to get a new yard.

01:30:42.437 --> 01:30:43.394
Ugh.

01:30:43.568 --> 01:30:45.004
I miss the loft life.

01:30:47.224 --> 01:30:49.095
Cheers to pulling weeds.

01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:52.316
No.

01:30:53.099 --> 01:30:54.057
How about...

01:30:55.058 --> 01:30:56.451
...here is to...

01:30:59.366 --> 01:31:01.194
...our new little normal.

01:31:04.284 --> 01:31:06.199
So long as you're happy
with that, Daze.
