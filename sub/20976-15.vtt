Waaah!

00:09.100 --> 00:10.233
Flex.
Let me see you flex.

00:10.233 --> 00:11.300
Suck your gut in.

00:11.300 --> 00:13.033
- I am.
- Oh, okay.

00:14.133 --> 00:16.300
- I noticed the bubble
immediately.

00:16.300 --> 00:18.033
- Like as soon as they took
the dressing off?

00:18.033 --> 00:19.166
- Like--mm-hmm.

00:19.166 --> 00:20.567
I have double bubble trouble.

00:20.567 --> 00:22.300
- Oh!
- Oh!

00:22.300 --> 00:24.166

in the middle of her chin.

00:24.166 --> 00:26.400
Are you willing to accept
those complications,

00:26.400 --> 00:27.567
and will you be happy
if you end up

00:27.567 --> 00:30.200
with a 20% improvement?

00:31.166 --> 00:32.567
- Not having a rear end,

00:32.567 --> 00:34.166
it's like a steamroller
just came

00:34.166 --> 00:36.300
and just crushed me
from the back.

00:36.300 --> 00:38.066
It's so ugly.

00:38.066 --> 00:39.333

- My name is Avery,
and I'm from Dallas, Texas.

00:58.333 --> 01:00.600
Girl, my chin has been
through the wringer,

01:00.600 --> 01:03.166
and I've got a big old dent
in my chin.

01:03.166 --> 01:05.600
As a kid, I always wanted
to play with Barbies

01:05.600 --> 01:08.200
versus playing
with the GI Joes,

01:08.200 --> 01:10.734
and so that was kind of
my inclination,

01:10.734 --> 01:13.433
like, "Okay, something's
a little different about me."

01:13.433 --> 01:18.200
I didn't realize that I was gay
until my teen years.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.367
It was really hard
coping with being gay.

01:20.367 --> 01:22.600
I didn't even want
to ride the bus to school,

01:22.600 --> 01:25.100
because all the kids
would make fun of me,

01:25.100 --> 01:26.500
and the boys would try
to beat me up,

01:26.500 --> 01:28.633
and that wasn't very nice.

01:28.633 --> 01:30.633
1990 changed my life.

01:30.633 --> 01:33.700
I fell in love with Mariah Carey
and her beautiful voice.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.500
And all through high school,
actually,

01:35.500 --> 01:38.367
a lot of the music helped me
to find a place

01:38.367 --> 01:40.166
where I was comfortable
with myself.

01:40.166 --> 01:43.100
And going through
being bullied in school

01:43.100 --> 01:45.500
and people making fun of me
for being gay,

01:45.500 --> 01:48.233
the music and the lyrics
helped uplift me

01:48.233 --> 01:49.367
above all of that.

01:49.367 --> 01:50.367
Right out of high school,

01:50.367 --> 01:52.367
I moved to Monroe, Louisiana,

01:52.367 --> 01:54.367
and my drag career began.

01:54.367 --> 01:57.500
I opened my drag career
performing as Mariah.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.767
I just thought
I was Mariah Carey down.

01:59.767 --> 02:01.400
You couldn't tell me a thing.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.667
Well, I decided
back in about 2001

02:04.667 --> 02:07.266
that I was more of
a transgendered woman

02:07.266 --> 02:09.333
than a gay male.

02:09.333 --> 02:10.734
It was a great feeling

02:10.734 --> 02:14.200
knowing that I was going to be
in my right body.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.500
I wanted to become
like Mariah Carey,

02:16.500 --> 02:19.100
so I got breast implants.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.667
I've been told that I have
the best chest

02:21.667 --> 02:23.533
in all of Texas.

02:23.533 --> 02:25.400
And, child...

02:25.400 --> 02:27.400
They always say,
"If you got it, flaunt it."

02:27.400 --> 02:28.667
So I do.

02:28.667 --> 02:30.333
After that, I decided

02:30.333 --> 02:32.266
to do some silicone work
in my face.

02:32.266 --> 02:34.333
Those looked fantastic

02:34.333 --> 02:36.533
for quite a while.

02:36.533 --> 02:39.734
But then the silicone
was changing my face.

02:39.734 --> 02:41.667
In all the pictures
that I was taking,

02:41.667 --> 02:43.700
my chin looked ginormous.

02:43.700 --> 02:48.433
I decided to save up and get
facial feminization surgery

02:48.433 --> 02:51.433
so that I could have
smaller features

02:51.433 --> 02:54.233
and get some of the silicone
removed.

02:54.233 --> 02:56.300
With a facial feminization
surgery,

02:56.300 --> 02:59.266
they actually shave down
your bones.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.300
That's when
the nightmare started.

03:01.300 --> 03:03.300
After that surgery,
all of a sudden,

03:03.300 --> 03:05.133
I started experiencing

03:05.133 --> 03:07.367
a lumpiness in my chin,

03:07.367 --> 03:10.667
and I started noticing
an indention.

03:10.667 --> 03:14.266
The doctor said
that swelling is normal,

03:14.266 --> 03:17.700
that it would take a lot of time
for the swelling to go away.

03:17.700 --> 03:22.533
And the more time that went on,
the more I noticed that dent.

03:22.533 --> 03:24.567
So let's see.

03:24.567 --> 03:26.467
- Oh, yeah.

03:26.467 --> 03:28.333
When I'm performing,

03:28.333 --> 03:31.333
people want to see
a gorgeous woman,

03:31.333 --> 03:33.333
and people have asked me,

03:33.333 --> 03:35.333
"What happened to you?

03:35.333 --> 03:37.700
Did you get hit in the face
with a machete?"

03:37.700 --> 03:40.467
- Are you on stage now,
like, thinking about it

03:40.467 --> 03:41.600
as you're performing?

03:41.600 --> 03:42.600
- Oh, every time.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.300
- Like, she walks outside.

03:44.300 --> 03:45.667
The first thing she'll say
in the dressing room is,

03:45.667 --> 03:47.333
"Keisha, I feel like

03:47.333 --> 03:48.600
they were staring at my chin
the whole time."

03:48.600 --> 03:50.600
And I'm like, "Girl."
It's awful.

03:50.600 --> 03:53.000
It's hard for me to say
exactly what she's feeling,

03:53.000 --> 03:54.734
but I never noticed I had
wrinkles under my eyes

03:54.734 --> 03:56.600
till someone said, "Girl,
you need some wrinkle cream."

03:56.600 --> 03:58.333
So now I'm self-conscious
about that,

03:58.333 --> 04:00.066
so in that way,
I can empathize with her.

04:00.066 --> 04:01.333
- I need to feel pretty again,

04:01.333 --> 04:02.333
and I need to--

04:02.333 --> 04:03.333
- She's still pretty.

04:03.333 --> 04:04.734
- But I don't feel that.

04:04.734 --> 04:06.200
The only thing I've ever wanted

04:06.200 --> 04:08.367
is just to be more feminine.

04:08.367 --> 04:12.367
It's hard for me to feel
like a normal girl

what was going on.

04:54.667 --> 04:56.767
That's when they diagnosed me
with Ewing's sarcoma,

04:56.767 --> 05:00.367
which is a rare bone cancer
usually found in children.

05:00.367 --> 05:03.533
They did a CT scan, and
they found the tumor growing.

05:03.533 --> 05:05.333
It turned out to be
the size of a melon,

05:05.333 --> 05:08.266

that's extremely large.

to the size around a fist

05:17.667 --> 05:19.533
is when they were able
to remove it.

05:19.533 --> 05:21.667
The doctors were more worried
about saving my life

05:21.667 --> 05:24.667
than having to worry about
the aesthetics of my body.

05:24.667 --> 05:27.266

08:29.533 --> 08:32.033
I noticed lumpiness here

08:32.033 --> 08:34.767
and then a horrible,
horrible indention.

08:34.767 --> 08:37.700
- There's always the risk
of nodules

08:37.700 --> 08:39.500
when you operate on an area

08:39.500 --> 08:41.166
that's been injected
with silicone.

08:41.166 --> 08:45.166
- Lately, I've just been
so morbidly depressed

08:45.166 --> 08:47.700
about how my appearance is.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.166
Every time I pass by a mirror,

08:49.166 --> 08:51.166
I just want to walk by
and smash that mirror,

08:51.166 --> 08:53.433
because I'm so unhappy with it.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.033
- Trans girls are so desperate

08:55.033 --> 08:57.133
to, like, be the image
that you see in your head

08:57.133 --> 08:58.166
and that you want to be so--

08:58.166 --> 09:00.066
- We just want to be
more feminine.

09:00.066 --> 09:02.734
- She's already aware
of what's wrong there,

09:02.734 --> 09:04.600
so when people make comments
around Avery's chin around me,

09:04.600 --> 09:06.600
I look at them crazy like,
"Girl, are you for real?"

09:06.600 --> 09:08.166
- So then why don't we go
into the examine room?

09:08.166 --> 09:09.734
- All right, thank you.
- Cool.

09:09.734 --> 09:12.066
- I'm super nervous

09:12.066 --> 09:13.734
to let my mom in on my secret.

09:13.734 --> 09:15.734
Kind of just kept it
to myself.

09:19.667 --> 09:21.734
- If he were to go into drag,

09:21.734 --> 09:25.600
do you think dressing him up
would officially kill drag?

09:25.600 --> 09:27.633

09:39.600 --> 09:41.767
This is called
the chin fat pad.

09:41.767 --> 09:45.033
It's made out of soft tissue,
a little bit of fat and muscle.

09:45.033 --> 09:47.700
All right, can you smile?

09:47.700 --> 09:50.166
Relax your lips.
Pucker.

09:50.166 --> 09:53.633
Okay, there's nerves
that come around through here

09:53.633 --> 09:55.500
that controls your lip.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.767
So there may be some damage.

09:57.767 --> 10:00.300
So here's the part
that's not predictable.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.233
When we go in here
and play around,

10:02.233 --> 10:05.367
there's even a risk of making
that nerve damage worse.

10:07.700 --> 10:09.600

on my face

10:09.600 --> 10:11.100

10:12.233 --> 10:13.500
I do shows.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.233
And your smile is important.

10:15.233 --> 10:17.367
Your smile's what people see,
just like your eyes.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.000

10:28.000 --> 10:31.133
Just...absolutely.
Yes, I would be.

10:31.133 --> 10:32.266
I'd be happy.

10:32.266 --> 10:33.767
I am willing to risk that

10:33.767 --> 10:38.266
in order to appear
more "normal" for myself.

with the dressing.

10:44.333 --> 10:47.133
- Do you think dressing him up
would official kill drag?

10:47.133 --> 10:49.000
- It's a risk
we have to take.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.266

11:07.300 --> 11:09.767
and I have
double bubble trouble.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.433
I grew up in a small town
in New Jersey.

11:14.433 --> 11:16.633
A little boy-crazy
when I was younger.

11:16.633 --> 11:20.367
At the age of 13, I had
my first menstrual period,

11:20.367 --> 11:24.633
which lasted over two weeks,
was extremely painful.

11:24.633 --> 11:27.033
But at that age,
I thought that was normal,

11:27.033 --> 11:30.700
so for the next couple of years,
I dealt with it

11:30.700 --> 11:32.300

11:32.300 --> 11:35.633
with this painful

"I think something's wrong."

11:50.033 --> 11:51.734
I went to a doctor

11:51.734 --> 11:55.333
who first mentioned the words
"endometriosis" to me.

11:55.333 --> 11:59.166
Endometriosis is when
the normal lining of your uterus

11:59.166 --> 12:01.200
grows outside of your uterus.

12:01.200 --> 12:04.734
And the endometriosis
was on my bladder,

12:04.734 --> 12:08.333
my intestines, both ovaries,
my pelvic wall.

12:08.333 --> 12:10.200
It was everywhere.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.667
but I thought that I had control
over my breasts,

12:25.667 --> 12:29.300
and that's really what pushed me
to have breast implants.

12:29.300 --> 12:32.166
This would make me feel
more like a woman again.

12:32.166 --> 12:33.700
I was always flat-chested.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.367

The problem is, is that
if you lower it

15:45.166 --> 15:48.500
just a little too much,
it creates a deformity,

15:48.500 --> 15:52.500

16:27.400 --> 16:28.667
- Result.
- Mm-hmm.

16:28.667 --> 16:30.266
- So you said,
"Hey, how do they look?"

16:30.266 --> 16:31.533
And she said, "Fine."

16:31.533 --> 16:32.667

- Nope.

16:39.700 --> 16:42.166

So would you have
prolonged periods?

17:16.633 --> 17:19.333
- Okay, how long ago
did you have your breasts done?

17:19.333 --> 17:20.467
- Almost three years ago.

17:20.467 --> 17:21.433

is overlapping.

17:21.433 --> 17:23.133
- Yeah.

17:23.133 --> 17:24.667
- The fact that I've
learned this recently

17:24.667 --> 17:26.200
is very bothersome to me.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.600
- Yeah, for sure.
- Yeah.

17:27.600 --> 17:31.133
Because she's been through
so much as it is.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.333
I just, you know--

17:32.333 --> 17:35.533
- Yeah.

17:35.533 --> 17:37.133
- And it's all my fault

17:37.133 --> 17:38.400
that she had no boobs
to begin with.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.600
With Kelsey having gone through
the issues

17:42.600 --> 17:44.600
with her endometriosis

17:44.600 --> 17:46.200
and having this issue now,

17:46.200 --> 17:47.600
it bothers me that she felt

17:47.600 --> 17:49.467
that she had to hide it
from me,

17:49.467 --> 17:52.200
because it's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.200
- So why don't we go
in the exam room,

17:53.200 --> 17:54.467
take a look?

17:54.467 --> 17:55.467
- Sounds good.

17:55.467 --> 17:56.333
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

17:58.467 --> 18:00.200

little undies!

18:00.200 --> 18:01.700
Look at the baby!

18:01.700 --> 18:03.367

18:03.367 --> 18:05.767

Yeah.

Put your hands on your hips.

18:19.567 --> 18:22.100
And push.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.767
Yeah.

18:23.767 --> 18:25.300
Not only
did you double bubble;

18:25.300 --> 18:27.100
you bottomed out, even,
a little bit.

18:27.100 --> 18:28.633
- I was like, "Wow."

18:28.633 --> 18:30.600
Had no idea.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.633
It's heartbreaking to see
how bad they are,

18:32.633 --> 18:35.066
that she would actually
withhold that.

18:35.066 --> 18:36.600
- So this is the first time
you've seen this.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.500
- Yes, I--
I'm amazed.

18:39.500 --> 18:40.567
- It's pretty significant,
right?

18:40.567 --> 18:42.066
- Yes, it is pretty significant.

18:42.066 --> 18:44.266
- So this is where
the pectoralis major muscle

18:44.266 --> 18:48.266
is inserting right here,
which also represents

18:48.266 --> 18:51.000
her original breast crease
right there.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
That's what your breasts
looked like originally.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.633
You can only lower the pocket
so much

18:57.633 --> 18:59.667

a double bubble deformity,

18:59.667 --> 19:01.600

that Kelsey's surgeon

19:01.600 --> 19:03.133
didn't realize that.

19:03.133 --> 19:05.000
In order to fix this,

19:05.000 --> 19:08.500
we have to create
a new room

19:08.500 --> 19:10.066
for the implant to sit in,

19:10.066 --> 19:11.734
and hopefully
the whole situation

19:11.734 --> 19:12.767
will remain stable.

19:12.767 --> 19:14.100

22:38.767 --> 22:41.233
I instantly lost the nerves,

apparently was...

22:42.433 --> 22:44.166

the nerves.

- Yes, sir.

23:06.033 --> 23:07.333

23:07.333 --> 23:09.467
Ewing sarcoma
is a particularly malignant type

23:12.400 --> 23:15.133

23:28.734 --> 23:30.333
that they're sick?

23:30.333 --> 23:34.033

23:34.033 --> 23:35.433

23:35.433 --> 23:37.233
'cause that's what he wanted

23:37.233 --> 23:40.233

23:40.233 --> 23:42.033
coming back to the hospital.

23:42.033 --> 23:46.467
As I walked in, he tells me,
"Mom, guess what.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.767
"I have cancer.

23:48.767 --> 23:51.066

23:52.734 --> 23:54.500
So it's hard.

23:54.500 --> 23:57.166
It's difficult to hear that

23:57.166 --> 23:59.033

23:59.033 --> 24:01.033
And it was harder for me.

24:01.033 --> 24:02.734
You know, I spent my time

24:02.734 --> 24:05.066
crying outside, you know,
while he slept.

24:11.166 --> 24:13.200
they have made bad decisions

24:13.200 --> 24:15.433
or, two, have had bad doctors.

24:15.433 --> 24:17.200
But in this case,
it's different.

24:17.200 --> 24:21.200
This innocent child
had a horrible disease

24:21.200 --> 24:23.333
cause a severe,
horrible problem.

24:23.333 --> 24:25.600
That is exponentially
more heartbreaking.

24:25.600 --> 24:27.467

to, like, not be a hassle

24:27.467 --> 24:30.400
to do things--
like, normal, everyday things.

24:31.767 --> 24:33.467

most of the time,

24:33.467 --> 24:35.266
'cause that's really all I do,
and it gets uncomfortable,

24:35.266 --> 24:36.533
and then I'm always, like,
the jittery one.

24:36.533 --> 24:39.200
- What about
romantic involvements?

24:39.200 --> 24:40.333
Has it affected that?

24:40.333 --> 24:41.367
- No, I don't think so.

24:41.367 --> 24:42.533
You know, I've asked

24:42.533 --> 24:44.367
every single partner
I've been with,

24:44.367 --> 24:46.233
and they're
totally okay with it.

24:46.233 --> 24:48.000
- So the nerves
to that area are fine.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.400
- No, those nerves are--

24:49.400 --> 24:51.400
I'm pretty sure
they're pretty good.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.367
- So it hasn't held you back
romantically?

24:53.367 --> 24:55.333
- No.
Romantically, no.

24:55.333 --> 24:58.033
- I've done many, many,
many buttock procedures

24:58.033 --> 25:00.300
for total buttock disasters,
okay?

25:00.300 --> 25:02.500
So why don't we go
in the exam room

25:02.500 --> 25:04.367
and figure out
the anatomy?

25:04.367 --> 25:05.433
- Okay.

25:05.433 --> 25:07.166
- Sounds great.
- Okay.

25:07.166 --> 25:09.300
- I do want Tristan to have
the surgery,

25:09.300 --> 25:13.033
because he has trouble sitting
for long periods of time.

25:13.033 --> 25:16.367
So putting, maybe, a little bit
of, you know, cushion back there

25:16.367 --> 25:19.133
would help him out, you know,
in the long run.

25:19.133 --> 25:20.367
- Okay, so turn around.

25:20.367 --> 25:21.567
- Okay.

25:21.567 --> 25:23.266
- And let me see
what's going on here.

25:23.266 --> 25:24.533
- Okay.
- Okay.

25:24.533 --> 25:27.500
So--yeah, hold that
right there.

25:27.500 --> 25:29.433
You have no glute here.
He has no glutes.

25:29.433 --> 25:32.000
It's pure bone.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.500
And you have more--

25:33.500 --> 25:36.100
you have something here
on this side.

25:36.100 --> 25:38.300
Let me tell you what I think
your options are, okay?

25:38.300 --> 25:40.133
Have a seat.
- Okay.

25:40.133 --> 25:45.033
- Okay, so your right side has

25:45.033 --> 25:47.400
absolutely no
gluteus maximus muscle.

25:47.400 --> 25:50.166
Your left side has some,
but it's smaller, okay?

25:50.166 --> 25:53.600
The reason that's significant
is because when we transfer fat,

25:53.600 --> 25:55.333
in order to get that fat
to "live,"

25:55.333 --> 25:58.266
it's injected in and around
the gluteus muscle.

25:58.266 --> 26:01.400
Otherwise, if you just do it
underneath the skin,

26:01.400 --> 26:04.066
it doesn't really get
its own blood supply very well,

26:04.066 --> 26:05.467
and it absorbs.

26:05.467 --> 26:09.567
The second option is,
you take fatty tissue

26:09.567 --> 26:13.066
from an area near that area

26:13.066 --> 26:15.166
and you rotate it down,

26:15.166 --> 26:18.600
and that's called
a pedicled flap of fat,

26:18.600 --> 26:20.433
and the reason
that tends to work

26:20.433 --> 26:23.300
is because it keeps
its blood supply

26:23.300 --> 26:25.633
from the area
which you rotated down.

26:25.633 --> 26:30.567
And then the third option,
of course, is a butt implant.

26:30.567 --> 26:33.166
If you don't have a gluteus,

26:33.166 --> 26:35.500
buttock implant risks
would be even higher

26:35.500 --> 26:36.500
that they would fail.

26:36.500 --> 26:37.500
- Okay.

26:37.500 --> 26:39.333
- The question mark is,

26:39.333 --> 26:42.567
will the skin accommodate,

26:42.567 --> 26:45.233
or do you need
pre skin stretching?

26:45.233 --> 26:47.500
That's called tissue expansion,

26:47.500 --> 26:50.233
which would involve
putting tissue expanders in.

26:50.233 --> 26:51.500
It could be done
through that incision

26:51.500 --> 26:54.066
that you already have,
maybe a little bit longer.

26:54.066 --> 26:55.233
- Okay.

26:55.233 --> 26:56.633
- A pocket's made
on each side

26:56.633 --> 26:59.200
and expanders put in,
and then you come in weekly,

26:59.200 --> 27:00.633
and we:

27:00.633 --> 27:02.500
- Keep expanding it.
- Keep expanding it.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.533
So you're basically
walking around

27:04.533 --> 27:06.266
with expanders in your buttock.

27:06.266 --> 27:08.500
It stretches the skin
and gets it ready

27:08.500 --> 27:12.133
for the ultimate transfer
of whatever,

27:12.133 --> 27:14.567
be it buttock implants
or tissue.

27:15.667 --> 27:17.333
- Okay.

27:17.333 --> 27:19.600
- So why don't you take
a moment, okay?

27:19.600 --> 27:21.333
- And then we'll be back in
to check on him.

27:21.333 --> 27:22.333
- Perfect.
- Okay.

27:22.333 --> 27:24.233
- Thank you.

27:24.233 --> 27:26.333
Well, what do you think?

27:26.333 --> 27:28.200
I don't know.
I don't know.

27:28.200 --> 27:30.266
I'm feeling just overwhelmed
with everything.

27:30.266 --> 27:32.467
It's just knowing
that I might be doing

27:32.467 --> 27:33.633
multiple procedures
over and over again

27:33.633 --> 27:35.266
just to fill out the expanders,

27:35.266 --> 27:37.233
basically go through
trial and error

27:37.233 --> 27:38.734
makes me feel really nervous.

27:38.734 --> 27:40.400
I'm 50-50 right now.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.567
- Ultimately, this is
your decision, Tristan.

27:46.433 --> 27:48.166
- Very little.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.166
- You can't have makeup
on your face

27:49.166 --> 27:50.367
going into surgery.

27:50.367 --> 27:51.633
- You can't blame a girl
for trying.

27:51.633 --> 27:53.700
We can't do that.

27:53.700 --> 27:55.500
- That crease
is a little tight.

27:55.500 --> 27:57.300
Right there.
- I see that.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.633
- I would hate to make
the same mistake

27:58.633 --> 28:00.433
that Kelsey's
previous surgeons did.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
- ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

28:13.000 --> 28:15.133
♪ ♪

28:15.133 --> 28:17.700
- So here's the question,
right?

28:17.700 --> 28:20.033
We do have tools
in our toolbox for you.

28:20.033 --> 28:21.300
We do.

28:21.300 --> 28:24.133
So what do you think
about these options?

28:27.300 --> 28:29.033
This is scary.
- Big-time.

28:29.033 --> 28:30.400
- This is--this is something
that's--

28:30.400 --> 28:31.633
there's a lot of commitment.

28:33.600 --> 28:34.734
I'm super, super grateful

28:34.734 --> 28:36.300
to have been able
to come out here

28:36.300 --> 28:37.734
and meet with the both of you.

28:39.700 --> 28:41.734
And, you know,
just to be able to--

28:41.734 --> 28:44.000
like, knowing the fact
that you guys just took a look

28:44.000 --> 28:45.166
at everything
that's been going on,

28:45.166 --> 28:46.200
it means a lot to me.

28:46.200 --> 28:47.700
It means a lot.

28:47.700 --> 28:49.266
But as of right now,
I just--I don't think

28:49.266 --> 28:51.700
I'm going to be able
to go through with it.

28:51.700 --> 28:53.333
And it's...

28:53.333 --> 28:54.734
- Let me tell you
something, okay?

28:54.734 --> 28:56.600
I don't blame you.

28:56.600 --> 28:59.166
- I feel like I am passing up
a great opportunity,

28:59.166 --> 29:01.333
but I'm scared to go through
with the surgeries.

29:01.333 --> 29:03.066
I think I'm still
a little traumatized

29:03.066 --> 29:05.066
from having all the surgeries
in the past

29:05.066 --> 29:07.000
that having to go through
multiple surgeries

29:07.000 --> 29:09.767
in a significant amount of time
just would have been

29:09.767 --> 29:11.767
a little too much
for me to handle right now.

29:11.767 --> 29:13.367
- You had a fatal disease

29:13.367 --> 29:15.200
at a very advanced stage,

29:15.200 --> 29:19.367
and you came out of it
healthy, happy.

29:19.367 --> 29:22.300
You're inspiring to anybody
who would hear your story.

29:22.300 --> 29:24.066
- I am very disappointed

29:24.066 --> 29:26.200
that he made the decision
not to do the surgery,

29:26.200 --> 29:28.233
but I'm just here
to support him,

29:28.233 --> 29:31.066
and I just want him to be happy
in whatever decision he makes.

29:31.066 --> 29:32.367
This is all for him.

29:32.367 --> 29:34.467
- Listen, I can tell you
one thing, Tristan.

29:34.467 --> 29:35.767
I'm not going anywhere.

29:35.767 --> 29:38.066
If you decide
you want to do this,

29:38.066 --> 29:40.333
we'll even have
that much more experience

29:40.333 --> 29:42.633
doing buttock surgery, okay?

29:42.633 --> 29:44.233
You both are awesome people.
- Thank you very much.

29:44.233 --> 29:46.033
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Pleasure, guys.

29:46.033 --> 29:48.266
- Thank you.

29:49.734 --> 29:51.667
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

29:51.667 --> 29:52.767
My name is Avery,

29:52.767 --> 29:54.000
and I'm here for Dr. Nassif,

29:54.000 --> 29:55.400
checking in for surgery.

29:55.400 --> 29:57.133
- Perfect. I will
let them know you're here.

29:57.133 --> 29:59.100
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.

29:59.100 --> 30:01.200
As Mariah always says,

30:01.200 --> 30:03.667
"After every storm,
a rainbow appears."

30:03.667 --> 30:05.767
And I'm ready to find
the rainbow,

30:05.767 --> 30:07.367
and Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow

30:07.367 --> 30:09.133
are going to be my heroes.

30:09.133 --> 30:10.734
- Miss Avery.

30:10.734 --> 30:11.767
- Hello.

30:11.767 --> 30:13.066
Hi, handsome.
How are you?

30:13.066 --> 30:14.467
- Well, look at that.

30:14.467 --> 30:15.767
That's a great way
to meet me in the morning.

30:15.767 --> 30:17.200
"Hi, handsome."

30:17.200 --> 30:18.400
- Always.
- You know Dr. Peng.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.667
- Hi, Dr. Peng.
- Hi!

30:19.667 --> 30:21.000
- Good to see you again.

30:22.100 --> 30:23.767
- Very little.

30:23.767 --> 30:25.066
- You can't have makeup
on your face

30:25.066 --> 30:26.667
going into surgery.

30:26.667 --> 30:28.667
We can't do that.

30:28.667 --> 30:31.000
- You can't blame a girl
for trying.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.233
- Previously, Avery's main goal

30:32.233 --> 30:34.033
was to get the chin
more feminine.

30:34.033 --> 30:37.433
Now her main goal
is to get rid of the dent,

30:37.433 --> 30:39.433
then secondarily
to make it more feminine.

30:39.433 --> 30:41.166
Can we possibly get rid

30:41.166 --> 30:42.700
of some of those dog-ears
on the side

30:42.700 --> 30:45.767
which are causing
that squared-off fullness

30:45.767 --> 30:47.000
on Avery's chin?

30:47.000 --> 30:48.367
I don't know.

30:48.367 --> 30:50.000
We'll begin
Avery's chin surgery

30:50.000 --> 30:51.166
by opening up
the old incision

30:51.166 --> 30:52.767
and shaving down the bone
on the right side.

30:52.767 --> 30:54.266
Next, we will pull

30:54.266 --> 30:56.133
the soft tissue and muscle
together

30:56.133 --> 30:58.700
and cut the excess skin
and remove the indentation.

30:58.700 --> 31:01.266
Finally, we will extend
the incision on both sides

31:01.266 --> 31:03.000
and excise the skin
along the outer edges.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.400
Hopefully, this will give Avery

31:04.400 --> 31:07.300
the feminine, dent-free chin
she desires.

31:07.300 --> 31:09.500
We're making
the incision now.

31:11.266 --> 31:13.467
All, right, so we're
exposing the mandible,

31:13.467 --> 31:15.300
the actual bone.

31:15.300 --> 31:17.433
The right side of the chin.

31:17.433 --> 31:19.066
Let's get the drill.

31:19.066 --> 31:21.300
I see
that the whole right side

31:21.300 --> 31:23.734
of the jaw, the mandible,
is longer and bigger,

31:23.734 --> 31:26.533
so I'm going to use my drill
and burr down or rasp down,

31:26.533 --> 31:28.400
soften up that bone,

31:28.400 --> 31:31.266
hopefully make the right side
look a little bit better.

31:38.567 --> 31:39.734
Power tools
in the operating room--

31:39.734 --> 31:41.200
now, that's fun.

31:41.200 --> 31:44.300
Because this is the area
that's no good,

31:44.300 --> 31:47.066
let's try to find a good plane.

31:47.066 --> 31:49.200
The thing is, this plane
is gonna be blurred,

31:49.200 --> 31:51.333
because she had silicone
injected in here.

31:51.333 --> 31:54.567
It's very difficult to create
a normal plane of dissection

31:54.567 --> 31:57.200
when you have no normal anatomy.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.767
So interesting.

31:59.767 --> 32:01.767
It almost looked like
that scar tissue,

32:01.767 --> 32:03.233
maybe we can use that

32:03.233 --> 32:05.333
as a platform
to pull it together

32:05.333 --> 32:07.467
and fill in
some of that depression.

32:07.467 --> 32:09.100
We were lucky today,

32:09.100 --> 32:10.500
because that scar tissue
that was formed

32:10.500 --> 32:12.367
from possibly the silicone

32:12.367 --> 32:14.600
gave us this nice, hearty
layer of tissue.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.367
We were able to actually
pull it together,

32:16.367 --> 32:18.233
stitch it together,
and guess what that did.

32:18.233 --> 32:20.233
It filled in the deficit.

32:20.233 --> 32:24.200
All right, so the deep layer's
been put together.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.467
The muscle has been
put back together.

32:26.467 --> 32:31.200
The softness has probably
improved about...50%?

32:31.200 --> 32:33.233
- I think it's more
than that.

32:33.233 --> 32:35.367
- We were able to use
her own tissue,

32:35.367 --> 32:37.600
no other type of implants,
not remove a lot of skin

32:37.600 --> 32:40.066
to get rid of the depression

32:40.066 --> 32:41.500
and also remove her dog-ears

32:41.500 --> 32:44.100
and even file down the bone
a little bit on the right.

32:44.100 --> 32:46.066
I can tell you now

32:46.066 --> 32:48.133
that Avery is going to be
very happy with the results,

32:48.133 --> 32:49.400
because I'm really happy.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.266
Take a peek,

32:51.266 --> 32:52.533
and just see
if you can even--

32:52.533 --> 32:54.000
can you tell anything
at all?

32:54.000 --> 32:55.266
- Well--

32:55.266 --> 32:57.000
- First of all,
I don't think

32:57.000 --> 32:58.266
anyone can really tell
by looking that close.

33:00.233 --> 33:01.633
No, can you see anything?

33:01.633 --> 33:03.266
- I can't see anything just yet.

33:03.266 --> 33:04.533
- Okay.

33:04.533 --> 33:06.266
Let's talk
about some good news.

33:06.266 --> 33:07.367
- Yes.

33:07.367 --> 33:09.233
Please.
I need it.

33:09.233 --> 33:11.133
- Well, first of all,
let me look at your smile.

33:11.133 --> 33:12.400
Let me see.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.500
Let me see
your lower lip.

33:14.500 --> 33:16.367
Okay, so that looks good.

33:16.367 --> 33:18.667
So the nerve that controls
your lower lip

33:18.667 --> 33:20.300
shouldn't be affected,

33:20.300 --> 33:21.633
and it looks like
it wasn't affected.

33:21.633 --> 33:23.166
- I knew you could do it.

33:23.166 --> 33:26.033
- So what we did is,
we ended up

33:26.033 --> 33:28.667
taking that area,
and it's gone.

33:28.667 --> 33:31.033
It's probably
about 90% better,

33:31.033 --> 33:32.567
that depression,
that flat pancake look.

33:32.567 --> 33:34.400
- Awesome.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.033
I'm really hoping,
once the bandages come off,

33:36.033 --> 33:38.567
honey, my jaw will be contoured
for days

33:38.567 --> 33:41.433
and I will have the tiniest chin
on Earth.

33:41.433 --> 33:42.700
Great.

33:42.700 --> 33:44.367
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, pleasure.

33:44.367 --> 33:46.533
- So the question is,

33:46.533 --> 33:48.300
what are the chances
that the implants

33:48.300 --> 33:50.266
will cause bottoming out?

33:58.000 --> 34:00.066
- ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

34:00.066 --> 34:02.266
- Last night,
I had trouble sleeping.

34:02.266 --> 34:04.333
I had anxiety.
I was worried.

34:04.333 --> 34:07.166
And now that I'm here,
I'm just--I'm good.

34:07.166 --> 34:08.734
With having endometriosis,

34:08.734 --> 34:10.567
I'm no stranger to pain.

34:10.567 --> 34:13.433
I'm strangely starting
to feel calm about the surgery,

34:13.433 --> 34:15.300
and I'm ready for it.

34:15.300 --> 34:17.266
- Kelsey, I'm going to get you
taken back

34:17.266 --> 34:18.567
to see Dr. Dubrow.

34:18.567 --> 34:21.033
- Love you.
- Love you.

34:21.033 --> 34:22.333
- You better be here
when I'm done.

34:22.333 --> 34:24.433
- I'll be right here.
Don't worry.

34:24.433 --> 34:27.467
I'm definitely nervous today,
but I don't want

34:27.467 --> 34:31.000
to upset her,
so I'm keeping it all inside.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.033
And I can't wait
for this evening,

34:33.033 --> 34:36.066
when I could relax
when it's all over with.

34:36.066 --> 34:37.433
- Kelsey.
How are you?

34:37.433 --> 34:39.033
- Good.
How are you?

34:39.033 --> 34:40.300
- Good.
Okay, do me a favor.

34:40.300 --> 34:42.367
Sit up for a second.

34:42.367 --> 34:45.100
And legs over the side.

34:45.100 --> 34:46.567
Hair back.

34:46.567 --> 34:49.200
Okay, so look at this, Heidi.

34:49.200 --> 34:50.500
Flex for me.
So look.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.233
- Yeah, you can see
exactly--

34:52.233 --> 34:54.300
- You can see exactly where
her original crease was.

34:54.300 --> 34:55.767
Look how short that is.

34:55.767 --> 34:57.500
The big question mark
with Kelsey today

34:57.500 --> 34:59.367
and thing that makes this case
actually really difficult

34:59.367 --> 35:01.100
is the fact that

35:01.100 --> 35:04.166
she naturally has
a very limited space

35:04.166 --> 35:07.467
between the bottom of her areola
and her natural crease.

35:07.467 --> 35:09.300
To get rid
of Kelsey's double bubble,

35:09.300 --> 35:12.433
my plan is to make an incision
underneath the areolas

35:12.433 --> 35:14.300
and expand her breast pockets

35:14.300 --> 35:16.066
and then release the muscles

35:16.066 --> 35:17.767
that are causing
her animation deformity.

35:17.767 --> 35:19.567
Lastly, I will insert

35:19.567 --> 35:23.400
two appropriately sized,
ultra-high-profile implants

35:23.400 --> 35:27.533
The most we know that you can
really drop a crease

35:27.533 --> 35:30.100
without getting
a significant double bubble

35:30.100 --> 35:33.133
is a centimeter, maybe,
maybe a centimeter and a half.

35:33.133 --> 35:35.533
Fixing a double bubble
and restoring

35:35.533 --> 35:37.233
the original
inframammary crease,

35:37.233 --> 35:39.200
where the breast
meets the chest,

35:39.200 --> 35:41.400
is one of the harder things
to do in breast surgery,

35:41.400 --> 35:44.500
because you have to reestablish
the normal connections

35:44.500 --> 35:49.000
between the chest wall
and the breast tissue,

35:49.000 --> 35:50.400
and that's very difficult.

35:50.400 --> 35:52.133
Okay.

35:52.133 --> 35:54.633
So this is a different type
of implant than she had.

35:54.633 --> 35:57.266
This is a high-profile implant,
a little more narrow.

35:57.266 --> 35:59.133
It's an ultra-high-profile.

35:59.133 --> 36:02.100
So it'll put less pressure
on the sides, hopefully,

36:02.100 --> 36:04.367
but give her
a really good volume.

36:04.367 --> 36:07.500
Could you sit that up?
- Mm-hmm.

36:12.166 --> 36:15.000
See, that crease
is a little tight.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.266
Right there,
it's a little tight.

36:16.266 --> 36:17.567
- I see that.

36:17.567 --> 36:20.100
- So I have to release that
a little bit.

36:20.100 --> 36:22.233
Ideally, you want the nipple
and areola

36:22.233 --> 36:24.033
to be in the middle
of the breast mound.

36:24.033 --> 36:26.133
Kelsey has
a naturally short distance

36:26.133 --> 36:28.433
between her breast crease
and her nipple,

36:28.433 --> 36:31.400
so you need to lower
that crease.

36:31.400 --> 36:34.100
The problem is,
the more you lower it,

36:34.100 --> 36:35.500
the greater the chance

36:35.500 --> 36:37.433
that you'll have
that double bubble deformity.

36:37.433 --> 36:39.300
Looks pretty good, right?

36:39.300 --> 36:41.266
And with the arm down,
it'll probably be less.

36:41.266 --> 36:42.567
Let's leave it.

36:42.567 --> 36:44.400
Let's close this side.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.166
So you need to find the balance

36:46.166 --> 36:49.266
between lowering it
and not having a crease

36:49.266 --> 36:53.567
and having the nipple in the
middle of the breast mound.

36:53.567 --> 36:57.133
Be really gentle
about putting this in.

36:57.133 --> 36:59.433
Okay.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.600
Okay, could you sit her up?

37:02.600 --> 37:06.433
I mean, this is what she should
have looked like after...

37:06.433 --> 37:08.200
- The original.
- The original.

37:08.200 --> 37:11.066
She was meant to have
short distance

37:11.066 --> 37:12.700
between her areola
and crease.

37:12.700 --> 37:14.467
I think dropping it
any further

37:14.467 --> 37:16.567
is just setting her up
for the same problem.

37:16.567 --> 37:18.333
I would hate to make
the same mistake

37:18.333 --> 37:20.467
that Kelsey's
previous surgeons did.

37:20.467 --> 37:22.567
I think this is the best option
for Kelsey,

37:22.567 --> 37:25.266
and I think she'll be
really pleased.

37:25.266 --> 37:26.300
Let's close.

37:26.300 --> 37:27.600
This should be good.

37:29.200 --> 37:31.367
- After having this surgery,

37:31.367 --> 37:33.500
I feel pretty.

37:33.500 --> 37:36.433
I woke up smiling,
because today is a new day.

37:36.433 --> 37:38.633
- Oh, my god, Avery!

37:46.633 --> 37:48.500
- ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

37:50.500 --> 37:53.500
♪ ♪

37:53.500 --> 37:55.500
- I'm a performer,

37:55.500 --> 37:58.633
and people's reactions
to how my chin was looking

37:58.633 --> 38:00.066
made me sad.

38:00.066 --> 38:03.033
But after having this surgery,

38:03.033 --> 38:05.100
I feel pretty.

38:05.100 --> 38:07.633
I woke up smiling,
because today is a new day.

38:07.633 --> 38:10.000
- Guys, are you all so excited
to see Avery perform?

38:10.000 --> 38:12.233
- Oh, it's been so long.

38:12.233 --> 38:13.767
- I'm so excited.
- And it'll be on point.

38:13.767 --> 38:15.000
She knows what she's doing.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.367
- Yeah, she does.

38:16.367 --> 38:17.667
- Let's hope this chin
is on point, okay?

38:17.667 --> 38:19.100
- Ugh!
Give it to me, mama.

38:19.100 --> 38:20.333
- Yes!
- Yes!

38:20.333 --> 38:22.600
- Here's to that.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.633
- Cheers to Avery.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

38:24.633 --> 38:27.667
- I'm so very happy
to see my friends.

38:27.667 --> 38:29.767
They've seen me do Mariah
a lot,

38:29.767 --> 38:31.533
but tonight's gonna be
different,

38:31.533 --> 38:33.500
because I don't have
any hesitations

38:33.500 --> 38:34.533
about performing.

38:34.533 --> 38:37.000
- Oh, my god, Avery!

38:39.100 --> 38:44.100
- Oh, my god!
- Whoo!

38:44.100 --> 38:47.233
- Oh, my gosh!

38:47.233 --> 38:48.533
- It's Avery's world.

38:51.333 --> 38:53.266
- Whoo!

38:53.266 --> 38:55.533
Avery's chin looks amazing,

38:55.533 --> 38:56.767
and she looks
like ten million bucks

38:56.767 --> 38:58.567
coming down those stairs.

38:58.567 --> 39:01.133
Mariah is gonna want
Avery's new chin.

39:01.133 --> 39:03.100
Get you a piece, Mariah.

39:03.100 --> 39:05.166
- Give us the high note.
- ♪ Ah! ♪

39:06.700 --> 39:10.000
- Oh, my gosh!
She look--

39:10.000 --> 39:11.767
She's a whole new person.

39:11.767 --> 39:13.133
- So you guys ready
to see me perform?

39:14.700 --> 39:17.166
I am, even though y'all
have seen all of my Mariah.

39:17.166 --> 39:18.767
Before my surgery,

39:18.767 --> 39:21.166
I had a big old gross dent
in my chin,

39:21.166 --> 39:23.300
and no amount of makeup
could hide it.

39:23.300 --> 39:25.700
People would say,
"What happened to your chin?"

39:25.700 --> 39:28.133
But now, thanks to Dr. Nassif,

39:28.133 --> 39:30.400
the dent in my chin
is completely gone,

39:30.400 --> 39:32.300
and I have a more round,

39:32.300 --> 39:34.066
feminine appearance.

39:34.066 --> 39:35.734
And I'm ready
to take center stage

39:35.734 --> 39:37.400
and be back in the spotlight.

39:37.400 --> 39:39.400
Hello, Hollywood.

39:42.133 --> 39:45.066
Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow
have taken me

39:45.066 --> 39:46.700
out of that dark cloud,

39:46.700 --> 39:48.400
and they're putting me
on top of that rainbow,

39:48.400 --> 39:51.033
and I just want to say
that I love both of them,

39:51.033 --> 39:53.200
and I cannot wait
to put them in drag.

40:07.266 --> 40:08.333
- Hello.
- Hello.

40:08.333 --> 40:10.266
- Good.

40:10.266 --> 40:11.600
- Good.
- Sore.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.300
- Yeah.

40:13.300 --> 40:17.767
- So I had to re-create
your old crease,

40:17.767 --> 40:19.734
basically take you back
to the beginning

40:19.734 --> 40:21.433
were you where,
a very short distance

40:21.433 --> 40:24.233
between your areola
and your crease,

40:24.233 --> 40:26.633
and then see how much
I had to lower it

40:26.633 --> 40:28.100
in order
to make it look good

40:28.100 --> 40:30.734
without giving you
a double bubble.

40:30.734 --> 40:31.767
So let's take this off.

40:31.767 --> 40:33.233
- All right.

40:33.233 --> 40:35.633
- So the question is,
what are the chances

40:35.633 --> 40:38.166
that the implants will cause
bottoming out?

40:38.166 --> 40:40.734
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's see.

40:40.734 --> 40:42.433
There you go.

40:42.433 --> 40:44.367
Did you see these?

40:44.367 --> 40:46.033
Did you see them, Mom?

40:46.033 --> 40:47.200
- No.
- Come look.

40:49.633 --> 40:50.633
- Oh, they look perfect.

40:50.633 --> 40:52.233
- Yeah.

40:52.233 --> 40:53.767
- That's what breasts
are supposed to look like.

40:53.767 --> 40:55.633
- Definitely compared
to what they did.

40:55.633 --> 40:57.367
- Yeah.
- Looks good.

40:57.367 --> 40:58.734
- From my point of view,

40:58.734 --> 41:00.333
my breasts are looking great.

41:00.333 --> 41:01.467
I'm extremely happy.

41:01.467 --> 41:03.467
I can't wait to show them off.

41:03.467 --> 41:06.266
- I overcorrected them
slightly down here.

41:06.266 --> 41:07.500
They're a little bit higher

41:07.500 --> 41:10.400
than they will be
once they settle in.

41:10.400 --> 41:13.100
But I think
they're sort of perfect.

41:13.100 --> 41:15.233
Definitely will not have
a double bubble with this.

41:15.233 --> 41:17.467
I'm happy
with Kelsey's breasts.

41:17.467 --> 41:19.767
Kelsey's happy.
Mom is happy.

41:19.767 --> 41:22.367
Now she can go out
and find that hot surgeon,

41:22.367 --> 41:24.367
just the way my wife did.

41:24.367 --> 41:26.100
Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

41:26.100 --> 41:28.000
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.734
Tonight is my first date
in four years,

41:30.734 --> 41:32.734
and I'm feeling super excited.

41:32.734 --> 41:34.066
Now that I corrected
my breasts,

41:34.066 --> 41:37.100
I feel like
a completely different person.

41:37.100 --> 41:38.367
- Oh, you look beautiful.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.100
- ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

41:49.100 --> 41:53.100
♪ ♪

41:53.100 --> 41:55.300
- Tonight is my first date
in four years,

41:55.300 --> 41:59.033
and I'm feeling super excited
and really anxious.

41:59.033 --> 42:01.433
Now that I'm feeling so good
with the endometriosis,

42:01.433 --> 42:05.300
I have that under control,
and I corrected my breasts,

42:05.300 --> 42:08.266
I feel like
a completely different person.

42:10.266 --> 42:11.367
- Oh, you look beautiful.

42:12.433 --> 42:14.033
- Absolutely gorgeous.

42:15.166 --> 42:16.433
- No.
Everything's perfect.

42:16.433 --> 42:18.166
- Yup.

42:18.166 --> 42:20.266
I couldn't be
more of a proud mama.

42:20.266 --> 42:21.467
I created that

42:21.467 --> 42:23.567
with a little help
from Dr. Dubrow.

42:23.567 --> 42:25.300
I'm so excited for you.

42:25.300 --> 42:27.033
- I'm so excited,
and I want to thank you

42:27.033 --> 42:28.600
for being with me
through everything.

42:28.600 --> 42:30.433
- Ah, wouldn't be
anywhere else.

42:30.433 --> 42:32.133
- And I promise
no more secrets.

42:32.133 --> 42:34.000
That's my promise to you

42:34.000 --> 42:35.266
since you were here
by my side through this all.

42:35.266 --> 42:37.000
- Aw.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.433
- I wouldn't be able
to do it without you.

42:38.433 --> 42:39.600
- I know.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.333
Give me those grandbabies
really soon.

42:42.533 --> 42:44.433
Before my surgery, I was having

42:44.433 --> 42:46.266
major double bubble
breast trouble.

42:46.266 --> 42:48.433
There was so much going on

42:48.433 --> 42:50.567
that I just couldn't
bring myself to date anyone.

42:50.567 --> 42:54.400
But now, thanks to Dr. Dubrow,
I'm no longer in trouble,

42:54.400 --> 42:56.066
because my breasts
are symmetrical.

42:56.066 --> 42:57.433
I feel beautiful,

42:57.433 --> 42:59.433
and I can't wait
to meet Mr. Right.

43:01.033 --> 43:02.066
He's here.

43:02.066 --> 43:03.333
Wish me luck.

43:03.333 --> 43:05.066
- Good luck.

43:05.066 --> 43:07.200
- Dr. Dubrow has given me
my 20s back.

43:07.200 --> 43:10.200
I feel sexy, and I feel like
I could take on the world.

43:11.100 --> 43:12.233
Hi.
- Hey.

43:12.233 --> 43:13.367
You ready?
- All set.

43:13.367 --> 43:15.066
- All right.

43:17.467 --> 43:20.066
- My nose looks like
a fully erect penis.

43:20.066 --> 43:21.233
- He's a good-looking guy,
don't you think?

43:21.233 --> 43:22.467
- I know.
Oh.

43:22.467 --> 43:23.500
I think we could be
a power couple.

43:24.633 --> 43:25.633
- I just want to jump
over that desk

43:25.633 --> 43:27.100
and "rarrr!"

43:27.100 --> 43:28.467
- The record was saying
no mutation.

43:28.467 --> 43:32.500
- So you had an unnecessary
double mastectomy?

43:32.500 --> 43:34.233
- Oh, my god.

43:34.233 --> 43:36.300
- I've got a nose
that only a cat could love.

43:36.300 --> 43:37.500
- Basically,
we're talking about doing

43:37.500 --> 43:39.033
every part of your nose.

43:39.033 --> 43:40.300
Took out all my sutures.

43:40.300 --> 43:41.567
- Oh, my.

43:41.567 --> 43:43.300
- We're gonna amputate that.
