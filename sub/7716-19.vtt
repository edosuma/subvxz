WEBVTT

00:05.090 --> 00:06.383
This is Pam.

00:08.426 --> 00:12.138
Oh, my God, are you sure? Okay,
okay, we'll be right there.

00:12.555 --> 00:14.015
Everybody!

00:14.099 --> 00:15.725
- The balloon is falling!
- What?

00:16.768 --> 00:18.353
There's this balloon
that has been floating

00:18.436 --> 00:20.355
in the rafters of the
warehouse for, like, ever.

00:20.438 --> 00:21.481
And...

00:21.564 --> 00:24.442
Okay, it's not, it doesn't sound
cool, you just have to see it.

00:27.028 --> 00:30.115
Well,I guess it doesn't
look that cool either

00:30.365 --> 00:32.492
But it's been up there
a long time,

00:32.575 --> 00:34.953
so it's become
a pretty big deal.

00:36.788 --> 00:38.957
Wow. It's the end
of an era.

00:39.457 --> 00:40.750
You did
a good job, buddy.

00:41.251 --> 00:42.794
Now it's time
to come home.

00:43.211 --> 00:47.215
I remember when that balloon went up there.
I was still with Gil.

00:47.674 --> 00:49.259
We were so happy.

00:49.467 --> 00:52.637
When that went up there,
I had hair like Rapunzel.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.599
How long do you think
it's been up there, Kevin?

00:56.766 --> 01:00.812
I just remember pushing aside
my silky bangs to say,

01:01.604 --> 01:03.148
"Look, a balloon."

01:03.523 --> 01:06.067
My Warcraft clan was
still on speaking terms.

01:06.151 --> 01:08.236
My kid didn't
have a face tattoo.

01:08.611 --> 01:10.739
I was still thinking
of going back to school.

01:10.822 --> 01:12.991
And I was still
just a paper salesman.

01:13.658 --> 01:17.412
This has been fun, Pam. Thanks
for calling us all down here.

01:21.166 --> 01:24.294
Kill the balloon!
Kill the balloon!

01:24.627 --> 01:27.756
Kill the balloon!
Kill the balloon!

01:42.228 --> 01:43.313
Hey!

01:43.688 --> 01:45.899
So they accidentally gave us an
extra egg sandwich this morning.

01:46.024 --> 01:48.067
- Who wants it?
- Ooh! Right here.

01:48.151 --> 01:49.277
Right here! Pick me!

01:49.360 --> 01:51.070
Allow me to solve
your problem then.

01:51.362 --> 01:52.489
Nellie.

01:52.572 --> 01:53.698
Mmm.

01:57.368 --> 01:59.370
Ugh! That is disgusting.

01:59.454 --> 02:02.499
Do you call that a King
James breakfast pie?

02:02.707 --> 02:04.167
What brings you to town?

02:04.334 --> 02:09.297
Certainly not the Harry Houdini museum.
What a nobody!

02:09.547 --> 02:12.300
"Oh, look, some Hungarian just
found their way out of a sack,

02:12.383 --> 02:14.052
"let's build a shrine."

02:14.135 --> 02:15.303
No, I've come
to work here.

02:15.553 --> 02:16.513
What?

02:16.596 --> 02:20.099
How could Robert transfer Nellie
here after the Sabre store debacle?

02:20.183 --> 02:21.893
She stinks of failure.

02:21.976 --> 02:24.062
The fact that she could
show her face around here

02:24.145 --> 02:25.688
is an embarrassment.

02:25.772 --> 02:28.775
I should know. I'm in
an identical situation.

02:28.900 --> 02:32.070
Robert did say you'd be joining us.
Welcome, I'm Tony.

02:32.987 --> 02:34.030
What?

02:34.155 --> 02:35.990
I said, "I'm Tony."

02:36.074 --> 02:38.868
Okay, I made a mistake. I
thought it might go unnoticed.

02:39.619 --> 02:41.037
But, I'm Toby.

02:41.746 --> 02:43.248
You messed up
saying your name?

02:43.331 --> 02:44.833
It happens, Okay?

02:45.250 --> 02:47.043
So let's just find
an empty desk for you

02:47.126 --> 02:50.839
and I'm sure Robert will be
with you as soon as he gets in.

02:50.922 --> 02:51.923
That one looks empty.

02:52.090 --> 02:53.550
No. It's Andy's office.

02:53.967 --> 02:55.760
Oh, is it?

02:56.761 --> 02:59.430
I have one simple
philosophy in business,

02:59.514 --> 03:02.100
if the seat is open,
the job is open.

03:02.183 --> 03:05.436
It's how I came to briefly
race a Formula One car.

03:07.063 --> 03:09.649
The three slowest laps
ever recorded.

03:12.694 --> 03:15.280
Another beautiful day
in Tallahassee.

03:16.447 --> 03:17.532
Good morning, Alonzo!

03:17.615 --> 03:19.033
Good morning, Erin!

03:19.117 --> 03:21.744
How are you?
How's your family doing?

03:23.079 --> 03:24.080
Bye.

03:24.622 --> 03:28.293
Look at this place. Five rooms
and I get to clean them all.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.212
That's right. I'm a
maid for an old lady.

03:31.296 --> 03:35.174
Her grandson's staying with us,
too, because he ran out of money.

03:35.592 --> 03:38.011
Listen to me,
bragging away.

03:40.471 --> 03:41.848
Robert
Nellie.

03:41.931 --> 03:47.061
How are you adjusting
to life in Scranton so far?

03:47.645 --> 03:50.982
So far, so good! The water pressure
in the hotel is marvelous.

03:51.608 --> 03:56.905
It is astounding what a difference
that can make, isn't it?

03:56.988 --> 03:57.989
Mmm-hmm.

03:58.072 --> 04:01.826
Now, let's find you something
fun to do here, shall we?

04:01.951 --> 04:03.953
Oh, I've already found it.

04:04.037 --> 04:07.790
I am manager, a natural next step.
It fits like a glove.

04:07.874 --> 04:09.375
We have a manager.

04:09.459 --> 04:12.795
Do you really?
Because it is 10:00,

04:13.296 --> 04:14.756
I've been in this
chair for an hour

04:14.839 --> 04:17.675
and no other manager
has come and sat on my lap.

04:21.804 --> 04:24.724
Excuse me, has anyone
seen Andy this morning?

04:25.642 --> 04:29.270
Yeah, that's weird. He's usually
here by now. Right, guys?

04:30.521 --> 04:32.774
Hello?
Andy, it's Robert.

04:32.857 --> 04:34.442
Why aren't you at work?

04:34.525 --> 04:37.779
Hey, Robert, I really wish I
could come into work today

04:37.862 --> 04:39.364
but I'm super sick.

04:39.530 --> 04:42.283
I don't care.
I don't care.

04:42.367 --> 04:44.702
Please come to
work immediately.

04:45.078 --> 04:49.040
Okay, I'll try to come in,
even though I'm really sick

04:51.334 --> 04:53.169
with the Florida flu!

04:55.088 --> 04:57.298
He just hung up
on me mid-sentence.

04:57.382 --> 04:59.300
I'm in Florida to get Erin.

04:59.384 --> 05:00.969
As soon as I heard she wasn't
coming back to Scranton,

05:01.052 --> 05:04.097
I jumped straight in my car and drove
straight down until I hit the ocean.

05:04.180 --> 05:05.890
My heart is my map.

05:06.599 --> 05:09.727
Turns out Tallahassee is about
two hundred miles inland,

05:09.852 --> 05:12.397
so I overshot a good amount.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.274
But still, not bad
for a heart map, right?

05:17.902 --> 05:18.987
Ew.

05:20.530 --> 05:22.407
Thanks a lot, BP.

05:23.074 --> 05:25.868
Not much we can do about this
until he gets here.

05:25.952 --> 05:27.203
Can't you do
something about this?

05:27.578 --> 05:30.707
Sometimes the flowers
arrange themselves, Jim.

05:33.918 --> 05:35.003
Right.

05:35.086 --> 05:38.047
What is going on,
and where's Andy?

05:38.631 --> 05:40.466
And what is going on?

05:40.758 --> 05:42.885
Erin, you got a package!

05:43.428 --> 05:44.637
I'm in the bathroom!

05:44.762 --> 05:47.265
Where's the postage? I mean
there's no shipping label.

05:47.348 --> 05:48.933
Did you wash your hands?

05:49.392 --> 05:50.601
Yes.

05:52.645 --> 05:56.441
Here I am, signed,
sealed, delivered I'm yours

05:56.774 --> 05:58.192
Andy, what are you
doing here?

05:58.443 --> 06:00.111
It's great to see you.

06:01.070 --> 06:02.071
Ah!

06:02.405 --> 06:06.701
Uh, I am here to take
you back to Scranton

06:06.784 --> 06:09.871
because I love you and
I want to be with you.

06:10.788 --> 06:11.831
Where's the ring?

06:12.040 --> 06:13.041
Hmm?

06:13.124 --> 06:14.667
Where's the ring, Lancelot?

06:15.001 --> 06:17.211
Would you guys mind if we
talked privately for a second?

06:17.587 --> 06:19.422
Sorry, Glenn.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.218
Um.

06:24.302 --> 06:28.139
Andy, I am so happy to see you,

06:28.389 --> 06:30.183
but I'm not
coming back with you.

06:30.892 --> 06:32.769
Why won't
she go with him?

06:33.019 --> 06:36.647
I don't know. Maybe it's because
he's not that handsome.

06:36.814 --> 06:37.815
Hey.

06:38.524 --> 06:39.692
Don't listen.

06:43.154 --> 06:45.782
So what is going on?

06:45.865 --> 06:48.576
That does seem to be the
question, doesn't it?

06:48.993 --> 06:54.040
"Hey, this is messed up, bro.
Who is this weird lady?"

06:54.665 --> 06:57.085
I know. It's a lot.

06:58.753 --> 07:01.339
So, who knows what's going on?
Anyone?

07:01.672 --> 07:05.468
You, yes, wait. I am very
good intuiting names.

07:06.010 --> 07:09.138
Is it Chumbo?

07:12.183 --> 07:15.478
I think it's a cross between
"dumbo" and "jumbo,"

07:15.561 --> 07:17.021
with a hint of "chubby."

07:18.147 --> 07:19.690
It's not a name.

07:20.108 --> 07:21.943
So no one can tell me
what's going on?

07:22.026 --> 07:25.238
Well, let me
illuminate things for you.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.490
We are getting to
know each other.

07:28.032 --> 07:30.201
"But why, my lady?"

07:30.952 --> 07:33.704
Because I am
your new manager.

07:35.164 --> 07:37.625
Robert, is Nellie
our new manager?

07:38.042 --> 07:41.170
This is an odd situation.

07:41.254 --> 07:44.799
But it's very interesting
how it's playing out.

07:45.299 --> 07:48.970
We live in this world
of routines and rhythms.

07:49.053 --> 07:52.473
Kevin ate someone's lunch,
Phyllis has a new necklace.

07:53.599 --> 07:55.268
Who is this woman?

07:55.893 --> 07:59.313
I came in here simply trying to get
to know you, learn your names,

07:59.397 --> 08:01.607
maybe have someone teach me
the company song.

08:01.858 --> 08:05.486
And what I got in return
was nothing but disrespect.

08:05.570 --> 08:07.113
You leave me no choice

08:07.196 --> 08:08.990
but to get to know you
in a more intimate way.

08:09.073 --> 08:10.324
Hot tub party?

08:10.408 --> 08:12.326
Performance reviews.

08:12.410 --> 08:15.079
How can you give us performance
reviews if you don't know us?

08:15.246 --> 08:19.375
On first impressions,
so I recommend smiling.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.627
It goes a long way with me.

08:23.963 --> 08:26.591
Erin, you really
nailed the hotdogs today.

08:26.757 --> 08:30.386
Thanks. I've been reusing the hotdog
water, so it gets more flavor.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.138
It's only going to
keep getting better.

08:34.557 --> 08:38.060
So, Andrew, how does your skinny
brunette girlfriend, Jessica,

08:38.144 --> 08:40.938
feel about you
visiting your ex-girlfriend?

08:45.276 --> 08:48.196
Well, we're not
really dating anymore,

08:48.446 --> 08:50.531
so basically,
I mean I just have to

08:50.615 --> 08:52.658
cross a few t's and dot
a few I's, you know.

08:53.576 --> 08:57.079
So you came to get me, but
you still have a girlfriend.

08:57.580 --> 09:00.041
I think you should leave,
young man.

09:00.124 --> 09:05.129
All right, technically yes. I am
still technically dating Jessica.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.590
But when I realized
that I wanted you back,

09:08.716 --> 09:10.635
I just jumped in a car
and I drove down here

09:10.718 --> 09:12.970
and I didn't want to stop
until I saw you.

09:14.096 --> 09:16.849
You didn't even stop to pee?
Gross!

09:17.433 --> 09:18.392
Any luck?

09:18.476 --> 09:22.063
No, he just keeps letting all
the calls go to voice-mail.

09:22.730 --> 09:25.650
Please leave a message

09:25.733 --> 09:28.903
for Andy Bernard
Include your name...

09:30.154 --> 09:33.908
Oh, you're doing so good! Oh, my
God, you're Superman over there.

09:35.117 --> 09:36.244
You should take it.

09:36.327 --> 09:39.080
It's probably your girlfriend
wondering where you are.

09:39.163 --> 09:41.207
Nope. It's just work.
Not important.

09:41.290 --> 09:43.125
You know I can really
feel this in my quads.

09:43.209 --> 09:44.585
I can tell I'm
getting stronger.

09:44.669 --> 09:48.089
You really wouldn't feel those kinds
of results after one session.

09:48.214 --> 09:49.257
I don't know, it's...

09:50.424 --> 09:52.134
Just let it vibrate.
It's fine.

09:52.218 --> 09:54.095
You could put it
on silent.

09:54.178 --> 09:55.763
I don't think
it does that.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.682
Just go to preferences,
then click...

09:57.765 --> 09:58.808
Proctology.

09:59.183 --> 10:00.309
Andy?

10:00.935 --> 10:01.936
Jim?

10:02.019 --> 10:03.020
Andy, where are you?

10:04.772 --> 10:07.692
I'm home in bed.
I've been in bed all day.

10:09.193 --> 10:11.112
I got the serious poops, man.

10:11.195 --> 10:14.615
He's here in Tallahassee, trying
to turn my life upside down.

10:15.032 --> 10:17.034
What? You're in Florida ?

10:17.118 --> 10:19.328
Andy, Nellie Bertram's
trying to take your job.

10:19.412 --> 10:20.663
What do you mean,
take my job?

10:20.746 --> 10:22.039
Like, set up camp
in your office

10:22.123 --> 10:23.165
and is calling
herself the manager.

10:23.249 --> 10:24.542
Okay.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.961
Jim, I really appreciate
you looking out for me

10:27.044 --> 10:29.714
but I'm not coming home
without Erin.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.048
So, I'll talk to you later.

10:32.383 --> 10:33.509
Guys!

10:34.719 --> 10:37.179
We cannot do these
performance reviews, okay?

10:37.263 --> 10:38.472
If we go into them,
you're basically

10:38.556 --> 10:39.849
accepting Nellie
as your manager.

10:39.932 --> 10:42.059
And trust me. You do not
want her as your manager.

10:42.476 --> 10:43.519
Trust you?

10:43.602 --> 10:47.231
The way Pam trusted you to provide for
her so she wouldn't have to work?

10:48.065 --> 10:49.317
I like working here.

10:49.400 --> 10:50.943
Dwight,
should she be our manager?

10:51.444 --> 10:53.821
I wouldn't let her
manage a celery farm.

10:53.904 --> 10:56.365
Those who can't farm,
farm celery.

10:56.866 --> 10:59.869
And when was the last time Dwight
and I agreed on anything ever?

11:01.078 --> 11:02.872
All right,
let's get going.

11:02.955 --> 11:07.501
First up, it is the woman with the
beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.253
Phyllis.

11:10.921 --> 11:13.007
Nellie, I'm sorry,
but I don't feel comfortable

11:13.090 --> 11:15.176
being evaluated by
someone I don't know.

11:15.259 --> 11:16.344
Oh.

11:16.427 --> 11:19.680
Okay. I understand. Let me show
you how these are going to go.

11:20.222 --> 11:21.182
Dwight.

11:21.265 --> 11:23.976
I refuse to be judged by
someone that I do not respect.

11:24.060 --> 11:25.353
I lost respect for you
in Florida.

11:25.436 --> 11:27.646
If it was up to me,
you would be in jail forever.

11:27.730 --> 11:30.691
Dwight, I have
completed your evaluation.

11:30.775 --> 11:31.859
You're getting a raise.

11:31.942 --> 11:32.985
What?

11:33.069 --> 11:37.907
Dwight, you carry this company
on your massive shoulders.

11:37.990 --> 11:40.743
You are our Atlas

11:40.826 --> 11:43.579
and for that, do you not
think you deserve a raise?

11:44.121 --> 11:45.873
There's no limit to
what I think I deserve.

11:45.956 --> 11:46.957
Then you accept it?

11:47.375 --> 11:48.501
Five percent, no less!

11:48.626 --> 11:49.794
Absolutely not.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.087
Seven percent.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.505
Six percent!
I know my worth.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.131
Raise isn't real.

11:54.256 --> 11:56.384
Money isn't real, ever since
we got off the gold standard.

11:57.635 --> 11:59.720
So, Phyllis, now you know
the rules of the game,

11:59.804 --> 12:03.682
do you care to have a go? I'm fairly
certain you're going to like it.

12:04.475 --> 12:05.726
Phyllis.

12:06.352 --> 12:07.436
Pam.

12:10.106 --> 12:13.484
So, Phyllis, I have been
very impressed with you.

12:14.318 --> 12:15.945
Really?
Oh, yeah.

12:16.028 --> 12:18.989
The way you conquered your
fear and came in here,

12:19.073 --> 12:21.033
and now the way
you sit there.

12:23.035 --> 12:24.662
All very impressive!

12:26.622 --> 12:27.748
Um...

12:29.166 --> 12:32.169
Are you aware that Nellie
is giving out raises?

12:33.003 --> 12:35.005
I am not. How?

12:35.923 --> 12:38.300
Yeah, she gave one
to Dwight, Phyllis...

12:39.009 --> 12:40.594
Let me guess,
you want one, too.

12:40.678 --> 12:42.721
Take the family
to Disney Town.

12:42.930 --> 12:43.931
Land! World!

12:44.348 --> 12:46.809
It's not that I don't want... Well,
yes, I guess I'd take a raise.

12:46.892 --> 12:48.269
That's not what I'm saying.
That's not... Sorry.

12:48.352 --> 12:53.482
Jim, I told Andy to come in
and yet he is still not in.

12:54.066 --> 12:59.321
By contrast, Nellie Bertram
saw a vacuum and filled it.

12:59.864 --> 13:02.533
I make no mention
of her business experience

13:02.616 --> 13:06.036
or her relationship
with Jo Bennett, my boss.

13:06.162 --> 13:09.039
Jim, would you prefer a nature
metaphor or a sexual metaphor?

13:09.123 --> 13:10.291
Oh, God, nature, please.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.334
When two animals
are having sex,

13:12.418 --> 13:15.796
one of them is communicating
a message to the other.

13:15.880 --> 13:18.048
Nothing is...
This isn't very helpful.

13:18.424 --> 13:20.509
You're going to want
to hear the sexual metaphor.

13:20.593 --> 13:21.594
Was that not the...

13:21.677 --> 13:25.014
All life is Sex.

13:25.598 --> 13:28.476
And all sex is competition.

13:28.642 --> 13:29.768
Mmm-hmm.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.812
And there are no
rules to that game.

13:32.563 --> 13:34.523
That wasn't so perverted,
now was it?

13:34.607 --> 13:36.233
Was that it?
No, that wasn't bad.

13:36.317 --> 13:42.031
My point is there is one person in
charge of every office in America.

13:42.114 --> 13:44.492
And that person
is Charles Darwin.

13:44.575 --> 13:48.370
In the end, doesn't he
decide who the manager is?

13:52.833 --> 13:55.586
No. I would have said no.

13:58.255 --> 14:01.300
Hmm. Let's see. Review, review, review!
Yes, good stuff.

14:01.383 --> 14:02.718
Here you go, have a raise.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.178
Ch, great!

14:04.845 --> 14:07.973
I mean if we go in there and take
these raises, what are we saying?

14:08.224 --> 14:11.227
That it's okay for someone to
just take someone else's job?

14:11.310 --> 14:12.603
Shouldn't work like that.

14:12.895 --> 14:15.189
No, you know what?
Nellie's right.

14:15.272 --> 14:17.525
That is exactly
how it should work.

14:17.983 --> 14:20.027
Darryl,
this office is mine now.

14:20.110 --> 14:21.070
No.
Yes!

14:21.153 --> 14:22.238
No.
Yes!

14:22.321 --> 14:23.322
No.
Yes.

14:23.405 --> 14:25.449
No.
Yes.

14:25.533 --> 14:29.161
Yes. Sorry, it's too late. I'm here.
This is mine. Back off.

14:30.579 --> 14:31.872
Ow! Ow!

14:32.039 --> 14:35.459
Ow!Ow!Ow!Ow!

14:41.257 --> 14:43.551
Well fought!
I accept the outcome.

14:47.221 --> 14:48.556
Touch me and I'll sue.

14:52.184 --> 14:53.852
I've heard that's
amazing when it works.

14:53.978 --> 14:55.062
Yeah. If I had my own...

14:55.145 --> 14:56.605
Andy, I care about
you and I think...

14:57.565 --> 14:58.566
Sorry. You go.

14:58.691 --> 14:59.692
No, go ahead.

14:59.775 --> 15:01.610
Well, I was just
going to say that

15:01.694 --> 15:03.362
if I had my own fountain
it would be two frogs

15:03.445 --> 15:05.447
and they're spitting
into each other's mouth.

15:05.531 --> 15:08.325
It's just stupid. What
were you going to say?

15:08.617 --> 15:10.202
Andy, you broke my heart.

15:10.953 --> 15:14.623
Do you know what it feels like
to be constantly rejected by you

15:14.707 --> 15:18.210
and to have to watch
you date someone else?

15:18.544 --> 15:19.920
You broke my heart, too.

15:20.004 --> 15:24.008
You broke my heart more
recently and more often.

15:25.342 --> 15:29.054
And I think at some point in my
head it just sort of clicked

15:29.138 --> 15:31.223
that we're not
meant to be.

15:35.769 --> 15:39.315
I'm so sorry that we have not loved
each other at the same time.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.109
I know.

15:59.251 --> 16:01.295
So, Pamela, I'm
going to start this review

16:01.378 --> 16:03.422
not by telling you
what you lack,

16:03.505 --> 16:06.550
but rather asking you
what it is you want.

16:07.051 --> 16:09.094
Really? Okay, well!

16:09.553 --> 16:10.638
Um...

16:11.013 --> 16:16.310
I like consistency in the manager's position.
No weird silent coups.

16:16.393 --> 16:17.686
Stuff like that,
I'm easy.

16:17.770 --> 16:19.021
That's not
really what you want.

16:19.104 --> 16:22.399
What you want is a good night's
sleep, working mother of two.

16:22.483 --> 16:23.609
Whoa.

16:23.692 --> 16:27.780
That's kind of condescending. Would
you say something like that to Jim?

16:27.863 --> 16:30.240
Does Jim
have to breastfeed?

16:30.449 --> 16:34.370
Did Jim carry around those babies
for, what is it, 12 months?

16:34.453 --> 16:36.246
Be honest. Does Jim really
get up in the night?

16:36.664 --> 16:40.542
Well, I mean, the only reason he
doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding

16:40.626 --> 16:42.503
and Philip
doesn't like a bottle.

16:42.586 --> 16:44.421
You must be exhausted.

16:45.547 --> 16:46.590
Fancy a nap?

16:47.508 --> 16:48.509
No.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.386
Go on. Have a nap.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.183
Lie down right here.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.395
There's a blanket in here.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.481
I used it earlier myself.

17:02.564 --> 17:05.776
Dreamt I could breathe underwater
like Jacques Cousteau.

17:09.571 --> 17:11.198
No one will know.

17:12.449 --> 17:14.118
I'll wake you up.

17:17.121 --> 17:20.124
When you wake up,
you will earn more money.

17:22.042 --> 17:24.712
I think you're a witch.

17:25.295 --> 17:29.633
I think you're amazing.
You know that, right?

17:31.635 --> 17:35.389
Go on. Say it,
"I'm amazing."

17:36.557 --> 17:38.100
I'm amazing.

17:47.526 --> 17:50.863
Erin, I think you're making
a big mistake right now.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.741
Andy is a nice boy.

17:53.907 --> 17:57.327
Really? Because you've been kind
of a "B" to him all afternoon.

17:57.745 --> 18:00.873
I was protecting you because
I thought he was no good.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.500
But I can tell
you really like him.

18:03.876 --> 18:05.836
And he's willing to
lose his job for you.

18:06.170 --> 18:08.464
In this economy,
with Europe on the brink...

18:08.547 --> 18:10.883
Irene, what would
you do without me?

18:10.966 --> 18:13.469
We're not your concern,
sweetheart.

18:14.178 --> 18:16.764
Besides, Glenn's
going to sue Home Depot.

18:16.889 --> 18:17.890
Why?

18:18.140 --> 18:21.435
He got his foreskin caught
in some lawn furniture.

18:22.227 --> 18:24.271
Jim, time for
your review.

18:24.354 --> 18:26.857
No, it's not, because you
don't really work here.

18:27.024 --> 18:29.193
Why are you so
staunchly defending

18:29.276 --> 18:31.612
your friend who
has abandoned you?

18:32.029 --> 18:37.659
Wouldn't you rather come talk with
me, maybe, definitely get a raise?

18:37.743 --> 18:38.786
See, that's the thing.

18:38.869 --> 18:40.496
I don't know if you
can even give raises.

18:40.579 --> 18:44.500
Jim, have you ever heard of a
character named Tinker Bell?

18:45.375 --> 18:47.211
Yes.
I'm Tinker Bell.

18:47.878 --> 18:48.879
No.

18:49.213 --> 18:52.925
I'm a magical fairy
who floated into your office

18:53.008 --> 18:58.680
to bring a little bit of magic into
your lives, to give you all raises.

18:58.889 --> 19:00.516
And we are grateful.

19:00.599 --> 19:03.811
But here's the thing
about Tinker Bell, Jim,

19:03.894 --> 19:08.106
everyone has to believe in her
or she doesn't exist.

19:08.232 --> 19:09.942
And then she dies.
She dies.

19:11.735 --> 19:15.823
Now who here
believes in Tinker Bell?

19:16.490 --> 19:18.200
Let's see it. Show of hands!
I do.

19:21.703 --> 19:22.704
Come on, everyone!

19:22.788 --> 19:24.081
All right, guys, stop!

19:24.164 --> 19:26.041
I already spent the money.
How?

19:26.750 --> 19:28.544
Come on,
Jim, you're killing her!

19:28.627 --> 19:29.670
We believe!

19:30.546 --> 19:32.089
We believe!

19:33.882 --> 19:36.301
Look at this
wonderful recognition

19:36.385 --> 19:38.762
of Nellie's leadership.
I believe!

19:46.103 --> 19:48.939
That did not go
how I wanted it to.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.608
Ugh!

19:52.317 --> 19:55.237
I have a whole ton of Erin's
favorite food for the drive back.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.947
Eggplant parm!

20:00.200 --> 20:02.953
It's biodegradable.
Animals will eat it.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.790
Andy, Wait! Andy!

20:07.332 --> 20:09.251
Andy, wait! Andy, don't go!

20:09.334 --> 20:10.961
Andy, I love you! Stop!

20:12.087 --> 20:14.923
Oh. This is the wrong Prius.
I don't love you.

20:15.215 --> 20:16.300
Erin!
I'm sorry.

20:19.177 --> 20:20.554
Andy.

20:35.277 --> 20:36.528
Let's get out of here.

20:36.612 --> 20:37.571
Okay.
Let's go.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.323
Wait, we have to go back
and get your stuff.

20:39.406 --> 20:40.449
No, I don't have
any stuff.

20:40.490 --> 20:42.326
Like your toothbrush and stuff.
I don't have one.

20:42.451 --> 20:44.328
You don't have a toothbrush? No.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.248
How do you not
have a toothbrush?

20:48.332 --> 20:50.083
I just, there's
always one around.

20:50.167 --> 20:51.251
You just use whichever
one is sitting there?

20:51.335 --> 20:52.294
I always find one.

20:52.377 --> 20:54.004
Have you ever heard
of buying a toothbrush?

20:54.087 --> 20:56.882
Of course,
I own my toothbrush.

20:58.800 --> 21:03.430
I grew up poor. I had little
formal education, no real skills.

21:04.139 --> 21:05.766
I don't work
especially hard

21:05.849 --> 21:09.436
and most of my ideas are either
unoriginal or total crap.

21:09.519 --> 21:12.606
And yet,
I walked right into a job

21:12.689 --> 21:15.484
for which I was
ill-prepared, ill-suited,

21:15.692 --> 21:19.112
and somebody else already
had, and I got it.

21:20.030 --> 21:23.325
If you ask me, that's the
American dream right there.

21:23.867 --> 21:26.244
Anything can happen
to anyone.

21:27.371 --> 21:29.039
It's just random.
