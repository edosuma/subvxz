00:17.433 --> 00:18.633
<i>But it's been sorted.</i>

That said, you're wrong. He's right.

If the English can't find it,

03:29.553 --> 03:30.634
they can't take it.

Well, now that you've been fetched,

04:01.050 --> 04:02.917
much to do.

04:02.918 --> 04:04.978
A war to plan for.

04:09.241 --> 04:12.570
I've heard you use that

A war against England,

04:16.063 --> 04:18.315

your darkest thoughts

05:21.995 --> 05:23.329
somehow had the ability

05:23.330 --> 05:25.799
to manifest themselves upon our reality.

05:26.871 --> 05:30.573
<i>That your anger over the

05:31.138 --> 05:33.610
<i>became the storm into

05:35.242 --> 05:37.476

But the truth of it,

07:38.462 --> 07:39.696

07:39.697 --> 07:41.464

There is a voice out there
yet to identify itself

14:20.522 --> 14:22.523

14:22.524 --> 14:24.625
removed from the gibbet in the square.

14:24.626 --> 14:26.342
Why does it look like this?

14:27.462 --> 14:30.298
An old wives' tale. Pirate lore.

14:31.010 --> 14:32.299
Avery's maiden crew

14:32.300 --> 14:33.633
was said to deliver the black spot

14:33.634 --> 14:36.136
as a warning to wayward crew members.

Ignored on pain of death.

14:41.475 --> 14:42.975
It was a bullshit story then,

14:42.976 --> 14:45.044
and it's no less a bullshit story now.

14:45.045 --> 14:48.531
Ma'am, cowards send notes.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.318
The form of the threat may
not rightly be the issue.

14:52.319 --> 14:54.152
We are aware there is
dissent on the street.

14:54.153 --> 14:56.322
Perhaps removing the gibbet

14:56.323 --> 14:57.656
would go a long way towards settling

14:57.657 --> 14:59.425
whatever unrest may be brewing.

14:59.426 --> 15:01.493
SOAMES: You're suggesting
that the governor comply

15:01.494 --> 15:03.329
with an anonymous threat?

15:03.330 --> 15:05.997
I am suggesting the gibbet
could be seen by some

15:05.998 --> 15:07.467
to be inflammatory.

15:07.468 --> 15:09.469
The point has been made.

15:09.470 --> 15:11.003
The law has been satisfied.

15:11.004 --> 15:12.639
It is a well-settled
statement of resolve

15:12.640 --> 15:14.140
to maintain the display.

15:14.141 --> 15:16.142
If it is removed in the
light of this threat,

15:16.143 --> 15:18.477
in the light of Captain
Flint's standing ultimatum

15:18.478 --> 15:22.481
against the use of it, would it not
worry you that it might appear weak?

15:22.482 --> 15:23.982
It certainly worries me

15:23.983 --> 15:25.484
to make self-defeating mistakes

15:25.485 --> 15:27.319
out of fear of appearing weak.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.009
ELEANOR: <i>No, he's right.</i>

15:30.536 --> 15:32.374
He's right.

15:35.011 --> 15:36.661
It gives me no pleasure having it there,

15:36.662 --> 15:38.069
no matter what the street may say.

15:39.332 --> 15:40.666
But to remove it in this moment

15:40.667 --> 15:42.000
threatens to undermine confidence

15:42.001 --> 15:43.317
in the governor's leadership.

15:44.370 --> 15:47.338
That said, at the end
of three days' time,

15:47.339 --> 15:50.314
I want it down and gone,
not a minute longer.

15:51.497 --> 15:53.977
If you would like me
to form a small detail

15:53.978 --> 15:55.145
to offer you protection
in the meantime...

15:55.146 --> 15:59.149
If anyone has a problem with
my allegiance to the Crown,

15:59.150 --> 16:02.736
my men and I are happy
to address it with them.

16:03.375 --> 16:04.476
Ma'am?

16:08.010 --> 16:09.109
Excuse me.

16:11.347 --> 16:15.516
[murmuring]

16:26.395 --> 16:27.856
You should be in bed.

16:29.433 --> 16:31.564
I've spent enough time in bed.

16:54.356 --> 16:55.856
I did what I did.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.708
I know how it seems,

16:58.709 --> 16:59.709
to the street, to you,

16:59.710 --> 17:00.710
but please understand...

17:00.711 --> 17:01.953
It seems...

17:03.853 --> 17:06.652
as though a very difficult
thing was done.

17:10.405 --> 17:12.154
It seems as though I am fortunate

17:12.155 --> 17:14.540
you had the courage to do it.

17:18.179 --> 17:19.712
You have enemies here.

17:26.186 --> 17:28.554
Then let them be my enemies as well.

17:32.954 --> 17:34.649
Any and all of them.

17:37.198 --> 17:38.670
And let them come.

18:00.687 --> 18:02.805
[birds squawking]

18:02.806 --> 18:06.391
[wood creaking]

18:25.377 --> 18:26.744
MAN: As you were.

18:29.482 --> 18:32.583
<i>[men chattering]</i>

18:38.357 --> 18:41.340
Six ships...
Two sloops, man of war...

18:41.341 --> 18:42.809
It's a familiar combination.

18:42.810 --> 18:44.961
I once had a fleet of that makeup.

18:47.031 --> 18:49.882
<i>MAN: Get her cleaned up, boy!</i>

18:49.883 --> 18:52.369
<i>[men shouting indistinctly]</i>

18:54.706 --> 18:57.356
I came looking for Flint, not you.

18:57.357 --> 18:58.725
Where is he?

18:58.726 --> 19:00.259
He's currently being pummeled

19:00.260 --> 19:02.394
by half the British navy
just beyond the horizon.

19:02.395 --> 19:04.498
The navy?

19:05.282 --> 19:08.534
The war to reclaim Nassau
began here about an hour ago.

19:08.535 --> 19:10.504
The entirety of the British fleet

19:10.505 --> 19:12.422
<i>under the command of
Governor Rogers is in play.</i>

19:13.579 --> 19:15.643
I'd like to think that you're
here to join our effort,

19:16.981 --> 19:18.315
but I fear the reason for your arrival

19:18.316 --> 19:19.500
is something other than that.

19:21.837 --> 19:23.170
Charles is dead.

19:29.512 --> 19:32.346
The governor in Nassau
hung him in the square.

19:36.018 --> 19:38.000
On the island I helped build,

19:38.001 --> 19:40.854
he thought he could do that
and face no consequences.

19:42.191 --> 19:44.224
He failed to account for me.

19:48.197 --> 19:50.346
British law sentenced him,

19:50.347 --> 19:52.181
but I think you and I
both know who it was

19:52.182 --> 19:53.849
that fashioned that noose,

19:53.850 --> 19:55.551
and it was no "he."

19:56.597 --> 19:58.354
<i>I look forward to seeing
Miss Guthrie again</i>

19:58.355 --> 20:00.757
<i>and settling Charles' account with her.</i>

20:02.125 --> 20:04.126
But there is no victory over her

20:04.127 --> 20:07.463
without a victory here today.

20:07.464 --> 20:09.014
That much is clear.

20:10.819 --> 20:12.985
Will you help us find it?

20:16.991 --> 20:19.975
FLINT: <i>Madness is such a
hard thing to define,</i>

20:19.976 --> 20:23.479
which makes it such an easy label

20:23.480 --> 20:26.197
to affix to one's enemies.

20:28.001 --> 20:31.092
Once it had been applied to Thomas,

20:31.987 --> 20:36.990
once our relationship had been exposed,

20:36.991 --> 20:39.878
defiled, scandalized...

20:42.483 --> 20:43.815
everything ended.

20:47.821 --> 20:51.138
There were times that I was persuaded

20:51.139 --> 20:52.473
to sue for peace since then,

20:52.474 --> 20:56.143
but that was the day

20:56.144 --> 20:58.671
that on some level I knew...

21:00.147 --> 21:02.124
that England was broken...

21:04.486 --> 21:08.539
and that sooner or later a
good man must resist it.

21:13.178 --> 21:14.495
I don't know what to say.

21:14.496 --> 21:16.214
You don't need to say anything.

21:18.165 --> 21:19.833
You asked me where I began,

21:19.834 --> 21:22.928
and I felt that you were
entitled to an answer...

21:23.971 --> 21:25.472
To the truth.

21:26.318 --> 21:27.825
I appreciate that.

21:30.329 --> 21:32.005
And I am genuinely sorry.

21:35.500 --> 21:39.318
But you can see how this
might be of particular

21:39.319 --> 21:41.053
and immediate concern for me.

21:42.757 --> 21:43.988
I can?

21:43.989 --> 21:47.793
Well, before today I knew of two people

21:47.794 --> 21:49.503
who managed to truly know you,

21:50.997 --> 21:53.289
to gain your trust, to be your partner,

21:54.334 --> 21:56.502
and they both ended up dead
while playing the role.

21:56.503 --> 21:59.004
- Now, wait a minute...
- Now you're telling me

21:59.005 --> 22:00.840
there's a third member of this class,

22:00.841 --> 22:03.342
making it even less credible
to characterize Mr. Gates'

22:03.343 --> 22:05.799
and Mrs. Barlow's deaths as bad luck.

22:06.979 --> 22:09.313
It would seem that those
closest to you meet their end

22:09.314 --> 22:11.559
not just during their relationship,

22:13.486 --> 22:14.876
but because of it.

22:15.988 --> 22:18.289
<i>And as I sit here, I'm acutely aware</i>

22:18.290 --> 22:20.158
there may be no one closer to you

22:20.159 --> 22:21.559
in the world right now than I.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.161
What exactly are you saying?

22:23.162 --> 22:27.499
That I've somehow sought
out my own tragedies?

22:27.500 --> 22:30.167
Did you not tell me that
our darkest motives

22:30.168 --> 22:32.003
will conceal themselves from us?

22:32.004 --> 22:33.838
Cloak themselves in whatever they must

22:33.839 --> 22:36.107
in order to move us to action?

22:36.108 --> 22:38.509
<i>And even if that's not true,</i>

22:38.510 --> 22:40.344
<i>a pattern is a pattern,</i>

22:40.345 --> 22:42.347
and only a fool ignores one

22:42.348 --> 22:45.116
because he does not care
for the implications.

22:45.117 --> 22:49.453
So you see yourself as a potential
fourth member of this class,

22:49.454 --> 22:51.789
concerned that your association with me

22:51.790 --> 22:53.924
will lead to your end.

22:53.925 --> 22:57.582
My association with you
began out of necessity,

22:57.583 --> 23:00.320
but I've come to find

23:00.321 --> 23:01.799
a great deal of respect for you.

23:03.031 --> 23:04.469
Perhaps even friendship.

23:05.580 --> 23:06.521
Hmm.

23:10.160 --> 23:14.348
Which is why I find myself
unnerved by the thought

23:15.480 --> 23:17.314
that when this pattern

23:17.315 --> 23:19.066
applies itself to you and I...

23:22.005 --> 23:23.896
that I will be the end of you.

23:24.584 --> 23:26.195
Is that so?

23:26.558 --> 23:27.958
Well, the three who preceded me

23:27.959 --> 23:29.602
all had one thing in common.

23:30.619 --> 23:32.294
They were vulnerable to you.

23:32.295 --> 23:34.464
Had more to lose than you,

23:34.465 --> 23:37.351
less means with which to
protect themselves than you.

23:39.488 --> 23:41.438
Until recently, I thought
that was me as well,

23:41.439 --> 23:44.425
but now...

23:45.994 --> 23:48.811
I don't know that it is anymore.

23:48.812 --> 23:51.481
It is natural for men new to power

23:51.482 --> 23:54.150
to assume that it has no limits.

23:54.151 --> 23:58.072
Trust me. It does.

23:59.841 --> 24:01.925
We agreed that I would select a man

24:01.926 --> 24:04.494
<i>to be responsible for
making a direct move</i>

24:04.495 --> 24:07.830
<i>against Captain Hornigold
once the battle begins.</i>

24:07.831 --> 24:09.765
<i>I chose Mr. Dobbs.</i>

24:09.766 --> 24:11.485
You chose Dobbs?

24:13.489 --> 24:14.871
Why the fuck would you do that?

24:14.872 --> 24:16.873
It's a dangerous errand...

24:16.874 --> 24:18.584
It's more than dangerous.

24:19.809 --> 24:22.478
The entirety of our plan
rests on its success.

24:22.479 --> 24:24.313
Why would you assign it to a man

24:24.314 --> 24:26.348
harboring who knows what sort
of resentment against you?

24:26.349 --> 24:27.911
Because it isn't resentment.

24:28.818 --> 24:30.152
If you had disciplined him,

24:30.153 --> 24:31.153
he would resent you for it,

24:31.154 --> 24:32.889
but towards me...

24:33.823 --> 24:35.508
I don't believe he feels resentment.

24:37.512 --> 24:39.501
<i>I believe he feels shame</i>

24:40.230 --> 24:42.208
<i>for having disappointed me</i>

24:43.032 --> 24:46.235
and a great need to redeem
himself in my eyes.

24:47.029 --> 24:48.170
Send someone else.

24:48.171 --> 24:49.186
It's done.

24:49.839 --> 24:51.433
He knows.

24:52.308 --> 24:54.142
Were I to replace him now,

24:54.143 --> 24:56.077
it might provoke the
response you wish to avoid.

24:57.039 --> 24:58.120
<i>If you're wrong,</i>

24:58.121 --> 25:01.872
if Mr. Dobbs takes this
opportunity to betray you...

25:03.670 --> 25:05.446
<i>to betray us...</i>

25:11.612 --> 25:14.712
this battle will be over
before it ever begins.

25:18.852 --> 25:22.604
Flint sent you to kill me,
yet instead, you surrendered.

25:22.605 --> 25:24.356
Why?

25:26.338 --> 25:28.171
I sailed with that crew for months.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.446
Then they take the side
of those fucking savages

25:32.447 --> 25:35.416
over a man who was supposed
to have been their brother.

25:35.993 --> 25:38.117
Truth is, they didn't
give a shit about me

25:38.118 --> 25:39.453
except that I did their bidding,

25:39.454 --> 25:42.484
so now I'm ready to see it end,

25:42.957 --> 25:44.723
and I can help you end it.

25:45.126 --> 25:48.011
ROLLINS: <i>Says he knows where
the slave camp is located.</i>

25:49.482 --> 25:53.184
Says the cache with the
gems is hidden nearby.

26:04.154 --> 26:06.688
Mr. Carter, please bring
me that man there.

26:22.280 --> 26:25.738
Unfortunately, I've known too
many men from Nassau in my life,

26:26.300 --> 26:31.020
and it's so very hard to know
which can be taken at their word.

26:34.858 --> 26:38.067
Show me that you truly intend
to leave Captain Flint

26:38.811 --> 26:40.432
and your life with him behind you.

26:42.185 --> 26:43.815
Oh, that man will meet the same end

26:43.816 --> 26:46.652
whether you shoot him or
some other man hangs him,

26:47.890 --> 26:49.320
but I'd like to be quite certain

26:49.321 --> 26:50.855
your intentions are true.

26:50.856 --> 26:53.308
[gunshot]

27:08.491 --> 27:11.775
Major, prepare your men.

27:11.776 --> 27:13.327
Sir.

27:14.830 --> 27:16.813
Lieutenant, prepare the men.

27:16.814 --> 27:18.315
<i>Make sure they have plenty of supplies,</i>

27:18.316 --> 27:19.816
<i>water, and ammunition.</i>

27:19.817 --> 27:20.934
<i>We're heading into the forest.</i>

27:32.649 --> 27:35.516
<i>[chattering]</i>

27:56.871 --> 27:59.205
[speaking softly in native language]

28:02.010 --> 28:03.592
[gasps, speaks in native language]

28:03.593 --> 28:05.345
MADI: He was hiding by the water.

28:07.849 --> 28:11.867
Otherwise, everyone is accounted
for and where they belong.

28:11.868 --> 28:13.536
All but you.

28:14.471 --> 28:16.888
You do not feel you
are where you belong.

28:19.126 --> 28:22.944
The men above would fight to protect us.

28:22.945 --> 28:24.657
I should be among them.

28:26.295 --> 28:28.784
<i>If we are to lead them into this war,</i>

28:28.785 --> 28:31.537
<i>we ought to show that we are
willing to lead them through it.</i>

28:35.810 --> 28:38.577
<i>♪</i>

28:46.987 --> 28:49.854
You have protected me for so very long.

28:51.324 --> 28:54.191
It is time I did the same for you.

29:22.489 --> 29:24.471
Did he get it?

29:24.472 --> 29:26.523
Your black spot was delivered, yeah.

29:28.527 --> 29:30.310
- But?
- I saw him.

29:30.311 --> 29:31.844
He was in the tavern
drinking with his men.

29:31.845 --> 29:33.323
They were in high spirits.

29:34.315 --> 29:36.149
And the gibbet remains?

29:36.150 --> 29:37.445
Yeah.

29:39.012 --> 29:39.987
I think it's going to take

29:39.988 --> 29:41.321
more than a note to frighten him.

29:41.322 --> 29:42.973
Of course it is.

29:44.810 --> 29:47.345
It was Mr. Gates who first
told me about the spot.

29:48.305 --> 29:50.785
It kept him awake for three nights.

29:51.799 --> 29:54.501
It wasn't the note or the threat.

29:56.002 --> 29:59.138
It was the idea of Avery himself,

29:59.139 --> 30:02.174
just the awareness that
someone so terrible

30:02.175 --> 30:04.160
- knew your name.
- [chuckles]

30:05.330 --> 30:07.313
I have no doubt that
Captain Throckmorton

30:07.314 --> 30:10.253
is currently unconcerned
with our threat.

30:11.151 --> 30:13.430
We have only just begun
to tell our story.

<i>of seeing itself embellished.</i>

45:32.117 --> 45:34.486
Do we care that it isn't remotely true?

45:34.487 --> 45:37.418
Doesn't matter what's true.
Not now, at any rate.

45:38.491 --> 45:41.187
We're creating the appearance
of a man out of nothing.

45:42.574 --> 45:45.964
The appearance of a man that the
resistance against the English

45:45.965 --> 45:48.300
<i>feels compelled to rally around.</i>

45:48.301 --> 45:50.969
<i>We'll introduce him.
We'll put flesh on him.</i>

45:50.970 --> 45:52.503
<i>We'll give him a soul.</i>

45:52.504 --> 45:54.138
But if the street wants to invest him

45:54.139 --> 45:56.474
with more than we can on our own,

45:56.475 --> 45:58.092
I won't fight them about it.

45:59.496 --> 46:02.146
But hat name isn't
doing anything for us.

46:02.147 --> 46:03.848
We'll have to see about that.

46:04.674 --> 46:06.417
For those of you who have not heard,

46:06.418 --> 46:08.486
the governor has imposed martial law

46:08.487 --> 46:13.023
upon all of Nassau Town in response to
the murder of Captain Throckmorton.

46:13.619 --> 46:16.159
He asks that I convey to
the rest of his council

46:16.160 --> 46:18.830
the contents of the letter
left for him today,

46:18.831 --> 46:22.515
taking responsibility for
Captain Throckmorton's murder.

46:26.990 --> 46:28.718
"I was no one,

46:29.474 --> 46:32.377
and then you came, and my island fell,

46:33.143 --> 46:34.495
and I became something else."

46:35.531 --> 46:37.189
Why not Flint?

46:38.315 --> 46:39.982
Flint?

46:39.983 --> 46:41.485
You want to put a man forward

46:41.486 --> 46:42.986
as the face of our efforts

46:42.987 --> 46:44.822
to oust the English from the island,

46:45.494 --> 46:47.156
why not use Flint?

46:47.157 --> 46:49.325
They all know him already.
They all fear him already.

46:49.326 --> 46:51.160
I've lived too long dependent upon Flint

46:51.161 --> 46:53.496
to be the one to hold
our ranks together.

46:53.497 --> 46:55.608
It's time we finally had an alternative.

46:56.166 --> 46:59.335
"On the night I confiscated
the pardon rolls,

46:59.336 --> 47:01.542
the night I started becoming,

47:02.048 --> 47:03.472
I made clear my position

47:03.473 --> 47:04.807
that there would be two sorts of men

47:04.808 --> 47:06.692
on the island going forward...

47:07.978 --> 47:09.478
Those like Captain Vane,

47:09.479 --> 47:12.315
determined to stand by their
oath to the very end,

47:12.316 --> 47:14.060
and those like Captain Throckmorton,

47:14.818 --> 47:17.014
happy to be the first to betray it.

47:17.988 --> 47:21.890
And thus, as always, to traitors..."

47:21.891 --> 47:23.826
Does he even know?

47:23.827 --> 47:25.494
Mr. Silver?

47:25.495 --> 47:28.877
<i>Does he have any idea
you're using his name?</i>

47:29.833 --> 47:32.168
What flows forth from this house,

47:32.169 --> 47:33.545
starting tonight,

47:34.338 --> 47:36.189
is a new story for Nassau.

47:38.800 --> 47:40.670
<i>I've watched her follow mad men.</i>

47:41.737 --> 47:43.696
<i>I've watched her follow rich men.</i>

47:44.831 --> 47:47.240
<i>I've watched her bow before tyrants.</i>

47:47.951 --> 47:51.320
<i>But now it's time she had a king.</i>

47:52.121 --> 47:54.222
<i>When we're ready, when he's ready,</i>

47:54.944 --> 47:57.343
<i>he'll step into the role
we've created for him...</i>

47:59.981 --> 48:02.023
<i>and lead an impossible army</i>

48:02.966 --> 48:04.850
<i>into an unwinnable war...</i>

48:08.322 --> 48:09.668
<i>and win it.</i>

48:10.473 --> 48:12.807
"Captain Throckmorton's black spot

48:12.808 --> 48:14.534
will not be the last.

48:15.310 --> 48:17.882
Ignore it, and join him.

48:18.481 --> 48:23.578
Heed it, and reclaim
your place amongst us.

48:25.171 --> 48:27.324
Until then, I remain...

48:28.791 --> 48:33.344
Long John Silver."
