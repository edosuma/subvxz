WEBVTT

00:16.808 --> 00:20.046
I'm Victoria, Goddess
of the Underworld.

00:23.115 --> 00:26.783
You caught me in my
feeding hour, lucky you,

00:26.785 --> 00:28.953
or I should say unlucky you.

00:28.955 --> 00:30.287
Well let's get to it.

00:30.289 --> 00:31.989
I don't have all day.

00:31.991 --> 00:35.192
It was 1962, Halloween night,

00:35.194 --> 00:39.562
the Walenskis were passing out
candy to the local children.

00:39.564 --> 00:43.236
I had a trick and Dr.
Walenski was my treat.

00:45.171 --> 00:47.437
Trick or treat.

00:47.439 --> 00:49.840
Well happy Halloween.

00:50.809 --> 00:52.775
Well here's a treat for you.

00:52.777 --> 00:54.979
There you go, okay off you go.

00:54.981 --> 00:58.414
You be safe now, brush your
teeth, doctor's orders.

00:58.416 --> 01:00.619
You have a wonderful
night, bye now.

01:03.890 --> 01:05.157
Hello doctor.

01:18.337 --> 01:22.907
Raymond, Raymond!

03:37.977 --> 03:40.511
Sweetheart, isn't
it too much food?

03:40.513 --> 03:43.414
Nonsense, it's our
little Susie's sweet 16

03:43.416 --> 03:46.919
and I want to make a breakfast
that's fit for a queen.

03:49.155 --> 03:50.586
I remember when you were 15.

03:50.588 --> 03:51.823
Oh, do you now?

03:53.558 --> 03:56.994
Oh, Raymond, what if
she comes in here?

03:56.996 --> 03:58.462
Oh.

03:58.464 --> 03:59.463
Good morning.

03:59.465 --> 04:01.965
- Hello dear.
- Oh wow gee.

04:01.967 --> 04:04.034
Yes, sweetheart I've
prepared all of your

04:04.036 --> 04:06.136
favorite breakfast dishes, see.

04:06.138 --> 04:07.670
Oh mom, you didn't
have to do that.

04:07.672 --> 04:11.707
We want to ensure this is the
best sweet 16 birthday ever.

04:11.709 --> 04:12.978
Sure thing daddy-o.

04:14.947 --> 04:18.082
So daddy, I was thinking
you could pick me up

04:18.084 --> 04:20.416
from school at 3:00
to go to the DMV.

04:20.418 --> 04:23.854
Oh honey, I completely forgot.

04:23.856 --> 04:25.222
You forgot?

04:25.224 --> 04:27.326
We've been planning
this for six months.

04:28.494 --> 04:29.960
Something's come up.

04:29.962 --> 04:30.896
I'm so sorry dear.

04:31.964 --> 04:33.130
How could something
just come up?

04:33.132 --> 04:34.664
We've been planning this.

04:34.666 --> 04:39.637
Darling your father and I
have something to tell you,

04:40.506 --> 04:41.907
but we don't want you to worry.

04:45.177 --> 04:47.643
Last week, when I told
you that your father

04:47.645 --> 04:49.279
fell and hit his head
and we had to block

04:49.281 --> 04:51.849
all of the light
out of the windows,

04:51.851 --> 04:55.785
well that wasn't entirely true.

04:55.787 --> 04:56.754
What do you mean?

04:58.124 --> 05:00.960
Your father has a condition.

05:02.261 --> 05:03.594
A condition?

05:03.596 --> 05:04.396
Yes.

05:07.133 --> 05:09.301
Hypermesisangrichavidarum.

05:11.871 --> 05:13.372
Oh no, oh daddy.

05:14.607 --> 05:16.373
I'm fine dear.

05:16.375 --> 05:18.876
Your mother and I don't
want you to worry.

05:18.878 --> 05:19.711
It's...

05:21.480 --> 05:24.882
Ah, hello there's
the birthday girl.

05:26.986 --> 05:28.152
Daddy, are you all right?

05:28.154 --> 05:29.987
I'm fine dear.

05:29.989 --> 05:31.490
Oh whoops, sorry about that.

05:33.526 --> 05:34.792
Turn the fan on, it's...

05:35.793 --> 05:37.995
Hey, what's wrong?

05:37.997 --> 05:41.200
Uncle Bob, Daddy has
hypermesisangrivadarum.

05:43.469 --> 05:44.734
I'm so worried.

05:44.736 --> 05:47.339
Raymond has an
allergy to light Bob.

05:48.740 --> 05:53.711
Oh, yeah, that
sounds awful.

05:54.413 --> 05:55.612
Yes it is awful.

05:55.614 --> 05:57.347
He can't even take
me to the DMV.

05:57.349 --> 05:59.483
Oh sweetheart,
I would take you,

05:59.485 --> 06:02.685
but I have a giant cake
to bake for your birthday.

06:02.687 --> 06:05.856
It's okay I'll just get
my license another time.

06:05.858 --> 06:07.393
Well hey I can take you.

06:08.494 --> 06:09.459
Really Uncle Bob?

06:09.461 --> 06:11.495
Yeah, anything
for you Susie Q.

06:11.497 --> 06:14.498
Oh, well that's so kind Bob.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.566
Isn't it dear?

06:15.568 --> 06:17.134
Yes dear.

06:18.070 --> 06:19.171
Oh, oh that's Margaret.

06:20.573 --> 06:23.273
But but darling you
haven't had any breakfast.

06:23.275 --> 06:26.478
Here have an egg and a pancake.

06:27.745 --> 06:29.146
- Thank you mom.
- Oh.

06:29.148 --> 06:32.249
Happy birthday my darling.

06:32.251 --> 06:34.184
- Oh.
- Bye daddy.

06:34.186 --> 06:35.652
Bye.

06:35.654 --> 06:37.789
Pick me up 2:45 okay?

06:40.259 --> 06:41.391
Our little angel
just hustling off

06:41.393 --> 06:43.896
to be productive in this world,

06:46.065 --> 06:47.866
my little bunny
just skipping along.

06:55.608 --> 06:57.176
Hypermesisangrigravitdarum.

06:59.678 --> 07:01.712
What was I supposed to say?

07:01.714 --> 07:04.047
How about I had
an important client?

07:04.049 --> 07:06.652
And make your daughter
feel like she comes second?

07:08.687 --> 07:10.721
Bob how many times
do I have to tell you

07:10.723 --> 07:14.324
not to bring blood into this
kitchen when Susie's here?

07:14.326 --> 07:15.160
Ah, sorry sis.

07:16.495 --> 07:18.761
I wish you wouldn't do that.

07:18.763 --> 07:20.364
Do what?

07:20.366 --> 07:21.200
Never mind.

07:23.402 --> 07:25.202
Oh, by the way you
guys should have seen

07:25.204 --> 07:27.170
the guy from last
night that I worked on.

07:27.172 --> 07:30.474
300 pounds, shut
in, real sweet face,

07:30.476 --> 07:31.942
you could tell he
was a good guy.

07:31.944 --> 07:34.911
Thank to heaven but the
insides smelled nice.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.713
Anyways, I got 15
liters out of him.

07:36.715 --> 07:37.549
You're welcome.

07:38.816 --> 07:42.286
We are so grateful
for all your help.

07:42.288 --> 07:44.454
What would we do without you?

07:44.456 --> 07:46.791
Um, that's what family is for.

07:48.827 --> 07:51.163
Speaking of which, when are
you going to tell Susie?

07:52.298 --> 07:53.764
- Never.
- Never.

07:55.501 --> 07:57.200
Now who could that be?

07:57.202 --> 07:58.437
It's 7:30 in the morning.

08:02.074 --> 08:05.110
Natasha, Natasha.

08:17.656 --> 08:20.791
You doing all
right there Raydog?

08:30.369 --> 08:31.601
Hey sis.

08:31.603 --> 08:33.403
Betty, I'm sure that
you have absolutely

08:33.405 --> 08:35.105
nothing to worry about.

08:35.107 --> 08:38.943
No my Ginger only barks
when she senses danger.

08:40.044 --> 08:41.712
- Oh is that so?
- Yes.

08:41.714 --> 08:46.683
You know is the
moon out recently?

08:46.685 --> 08:49.486
Yes, because I hear that animals

08:49.488 --> 08:52.589
are affected by lunar phases.

08:52.591 --> 08:55.025
No no, it's more than that.

08:55.027 --> 08:57.696
Hey sis, Raymond
is acting real kook.

09:02.167 --> 09:05.068
Oh hello.

09:05.070 --> 09:05.904
Hi.

09:07.239 --> 09:08.941
Do you care to
introduce us sis?

09:10.075 --> 09:11.241
Betty this is my brother Bob.

09:11.243 --> 09:12.211
Bob, this is Betty.

09:13.245 --> 09:14.711
- Oh Betty.
- Bob.

09:14.713 --> 09:16.982
That's a name as well.

09:18.917 --> 09:20.819
Oh my this is Ginger.

09:23.789 --> 09:25.924
I have never seen a
finer dog in my life.

09:28.494 --> 09:30.894
So you live near here?

09:30.896 --> 09:31.928
Okay, don't even answer that.

09:31.930 --> 09:33.463
That's all right.

09:33.465 --> 09:34.965
Did you have
something to tell me?

09:34.967 --> 09:36.133
Uh uh.

09:36.135 --> 09:37.567
- Bob?
- Yeah.

09:37.569 --> 09:41.873
It's just that
Raymond is acting a little off.

09:41.875 --> 09:44.207
- Raymond?
- A little different.

09:44.209 --> 09:45.809
A little different, what
do you mean by different?

09:45.811 --> 09:47.411
He's not really the
same as yesterday.

09:47.413 --> 09:48.445
Is everything okay?

09:48.447 --> 09:50.380
Yes Betty everything is fine.

09:50.382 --> 09:51.250
Everything is great.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.951
It's bad.

09:54.953 --> 09:55.786
How bad?

09:55.788 --> 09:56.753
Pretty bad.

09:56.755 --> 09:57.889
Is something going on?

09:57.891 --> 09:59.891
- No Bob why don't you go...
- I could make you a drink.

09:59.893 --> 10:01.158
And Betty everything is fine,

10:01.160 --> 10:03.994
I'll let you know if
there's any unusual activity

10:03.996 --> 10:05.796
in the neighborhood, all right?

10:05.798 --> 10:06.997
- All right.
- Stop by anytime.

10:06.999 --> 10:08.532
- Yes, Goodbye Bob.
- I'm usually here.

10:08.534 --> 10:10.133
- I'd like that.
- Ciao.

10:10.135 --> 10:11.701
- Maybe tomorrow.
- Yes, thank you,

10:11.703 --> 10:13.105
- bye bye.
- Bye Betty.

10:14.139 --> 10:15.238
Bye.

10:19.611 --> 10:21.144
This is bad.

10:21.146 --> 10:23.549
Yeah, but at least he's
cleaning up after himself.

10:26.985 --> 10:28.855
Ms. Jones is Dr. Walenski.

10:29.721 --> 10:30.987
Are
you feeling better?

10:30.989 --> 10:32.255
Yes, that is why I'm calling.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.493
I need to reschedule our
appointment for today.

10:35.862 --> 10:37.294
No no, nothing is wrong.

10:37.296 --> 10:39.763
I'm just a little
under the weather

10:39.765 --> 10:41.733
and I wouldn't want
you to catch my bug.

10:44.403 --> 10:45.903
Yes, I'm sure I'll be fine.

10:45.905 --> 10:48.875
I will do that, okay thank you.

10:52.277 --> 10:57.282
Hey Ray-dio, practice
has really taken a dump eh?

10:59.518 --> 11:00.984
Been there.

11:00.986 --> 11:04.688
Well don't worry about it,
everything's gonna bounce back.

11:04.690 --> 11:06.056
Why are you so chipper?

11:06.058 --> 11:07.290
Because my friend I believe

11:07.292 --> 11:09.793
in the power of
positive thinking.

11:09.795 --> 11:11.228
There's nothing
positive about this.

11:11.230 --> 11:12.696
I'm a monster Bob.

11:12.698 --> 11:15.098
Okay, A that's not true,
you're not a monster.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.199
You're a great dad.

11:16.201 --> 11:18.870
You just love blood.

11:18.872 --> 11:21.204
And B, this is very positive.

11:21.206 --> 11:22.706
I mean look at me.

11:22.708 --> 11:26.309
Before this happened, I
was alone with dead people

11:26.311 --> 11:28.678
and now I'm here with you guys,

11:28.680 --> 11:32.182
draining cadavers,
learning psychiatry.

11:32.184 --> 11:33.483
We're best friends.

11:33.485 --> 11:34.888
This is very positive.

11:36.555 --> 11:39.824
What happens if I go completely
crazy in front of Susie?

11:39.826 --> 11:40.790
That's not gonna happen,

11:40.792 --> 11:42.425
because I'm not gonna allow it.

11:42.427 --> 11:43.895
No we'll figure it out.

11:43.897 --> 11:46.498
You're a psychiatrist,
let's psychiatrize this.

11:47.633 --> 11:48.467
I got it.

11:50.068 --> 11:51.735
I can hypnotize you.

11:51.737 --> 11:53.169
It takes a
trained professional

11:53.171 --> 11:55.338
to properly hypnotize
a subject Bob.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.574
Nah, I've seen movies.

11:57.576 --> 12:00.677
You are getting very sleepy.

12:00.679 --> 12:01.513
No I'm not.

12:02.648 --> 12:04.481
Your eyes find
themselves closing.

12:04.483 --> 12:05.983
I'm wide awake.

12:05.985 --> 12:10.021
You find yourself in a
trance-like state Raydog.

12:17.296 --> 12:20.732
Hmm.

12:25.437 --> 12:26.271
Did it work?

12:45.357 --> 12:46.656
You!

12:46.658 --> 12:50.226
Ah.

12:50.228 --> 12:52.063
Hiya, I'm Bob.

12:52.065 --> 12:55.900
I'm Victoria, Goddess
of the Underworld.

12:55.902 --> 13:00.907
Ah jeepers, I thought
hey there's a colleague.

13:02.075 --> 13:04.343
I work with the dead
too, put it there.

13:06.144 --> 13:07.711
I wish there could
have been another way,

13:07.713 --> 13:11.550
Dr. Walker but you came
highly recommended.

13:12.852 --> 13:14.988
Oh, did you want
to say something?

13:21.027 --> 13:25.197
It's Dr. Walenski, Raymond
Walenski, not Walker.

13:26.531 --> 13:29.234
Oh dear, I made a mistake.

13:30.702 --> 13:32.335
You ruined my life.

13:32.337 --> 13:35.072
Walker, Walenski it's
an easy mistake to make.

13:35.074 --> 13:36.640
Don't be mad.

13:36.642 --> 13:38.541
You turn people into monsters.

13:38.543 --> 13:41.045
I never harm anybody
without a good reason.

13:41.047 --> 13:43.014
I'm not a beast Raymond.

13:43.016 --> 13:46.416
The underworld has
such a bad reputation.

13:46.418 --> 13:49.120
It really hurts the way
we are misunderstood.

13:49.122 --> 13:51.521
We have feelings Raymond.

13:51.523 --> 13:53.024
We?

13:53.026 --> 13:57.794
Us, changelings, vampires,
zombies, witches, ghouls,

13:57.796 --> 14:00.131
heck even the smelly werewolves.

14:00.133 --> 14:03.968
You recruited me
into your little club

14:03.970 --> 14:05.903
because you need a psychologist.

14:05.905 --> 14:08.973
Actually, I meant
to bite Mr. Walker,

14:08.975 --> 14:10.076
but I guess you'll do.

14:10.910 --> 14:15.679
Ah, such a temper, my goodness.

14:15.681 --> 14:20.686
Well your patients will be
arriving shortly and who knows?

14:22.088 --> 14:26.458
In time, you actually might
find it quite rewarding.

14:27.626 --> 14:31.128
Welcome to the family
Mr. Walker.

14:31.130 --> 14:35.233
He's a strange one.

14:36.234 --> 14:37.103
Bye bye.

14:39.939 --> 14:41.172
It's Walenski.

14:41.174 --> 14:42.108
I like her.

14:42.975 --> 14:44.474
I hate her.

14:44.476 --> 14:48.145
Wait no no, you are
looking at this all wrong.

14:48.147 --> 14:50.816
Okay this, this an opportunity.

14:52.217 --> 14:54.617
I can't believe you're making
this into a positive thing.

14:54.619 --> 14:57.955
Of course I am, listen
think of all those creatures

14:57.957 --> 15:01.224
out there sad, lonely,
in need of help.

15:01.226 --> 15:04.260
This is a way for you to put
your practice back on its feet

15:04.262 --> 15:06.197
and do some real good
at the same time.

15:06.199 --> 15:08.032
Only you would say that.

15:08.034 --> 15:09.234
You love dead people.

15:10.870 --> 15:11.668
I do.

15:11.670 --> 15:12.671
You really get me.

15:16.742 --> 15:18.144
We're
not best friends.

15:20.312 --> 15:21.147
You're upset.

15:30.589 --> 15:31.989
Hello dear.

15:31.991 --> 15:33.991
Oh, hello handsome.

15:33.993 --> 15:36.626
You feeling more
like yourself dear?

15:36.628 --> 15:37.462
I am.

15:38.697 --> 15:40.597
You have done a fantastic job.

15:40.599 --> 15:41.533
Susie will love it.

15:43.268 --> 15:44.969
Where is our birthday girl?

15:44.971 --> 15:46.971
Oh, she's getting ready.

15:46.973 --> 15:50.074
Oh by the way I bought
her a birthday dress.

15:50.076 --> 15:52.776
It was just a little bit pricey,

15:52.778 --> 15:54.477
I hope you don't mind.

15:54.479 --> 15:55.313
It's worth it.

16:01.353 --> 16:03.522
- Oh look at that.
- Darling.

16:06.926 --> 16:07.759
Oh.

16:09.761 --> 16:13.329
Oh dear, do you have
any idea how long

16:13.331 --> 16:15.732
that flower arrangement
took me to do?

16:15.734 --> 16:17.302
The rose looks better on you.

16:19.571 --> 16:22.072
Well I wouldn't
even know would I?

16:22.074 --> 16:24.707
You hid all the mirrors
in the garage didn't you?

16:24.709 --> 16:27.443
I feel so horrible lying to her.

16:27.445 --> 16:28.647
Yes, me too.

16:30.549 --> 16:35.054
If anybody sees a giant
bug don't step on it.

16:37.089 --> 16:39.689
Wow, you guys look fantastic.

16:39.691 --> 16:40.592
Here get together.

16:41.526 --> 16:42.761
Okay say cheese.

16:44.663 --> 16:47.900
Oh yeah, this is
gonna be a keeper.

16:49.634 --> 16:50.669
Now who's that?

17:12.790 --> 17:15.828
Gee, Susie like a movie star.

17:21.901 --> 17:25.637
I'm so happy you can
make it tonight Jimmy.

17:31.409 --> 17:32.345
Oh Susie.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.317
Now that you
know where I live,

17:39.185 --> 17:40.552
you can come over any time.

17:43.722 --> 17:44.623
Any time?

17:46.658 --> 17:47.559
Any time.

17:53.165 --> 17:55.598
Whoa whoa whoa, what
about your parents?

17:55.600 --> 17:58.271
You can meet them, come, come!

18:04.743 --> 18:09.748
Mom, dad, Uncle Bob, this is
Jimmy Dawson, my boyfriend.

18:10.715 --> 18:13.350
Glad to meet you sir, ma'am.

18:13.352 --> 18:14.186
Boyfriend.

18:15.388 --> 18:16.921
Jeepers, you're a
handsome man Jimmy.

18:16.923 --> 18:18.956
Welcome to the family.

18:18.958 --> 18:20.490
Boyfriend.

18:20.492 --> 18:24.494
Jimmy and I have been
going steady for a month.

18:24.496 --> 18:25.331
A month.

18:26.431 --> 18:28.098
That's right.

18:28.100 --> 18:28.935
A month.

18:30.970 --> 18:33.039
- Sweetheart.
- James.

18:34.706 --> 18:38.976
Sweetheart, that's not
the dress that I bought you.

18:38.978 --> 18:40.612
Don't I look
like a movie star?

18:41.847 --> 18:45.517
- Yes, so tight.
- Very mature.

18:48.553 --> 18:49.719
I hate him.

18:49.721 --> 18:51.088
Honey.

18:51.090 --> 18:52.856
Hey you guys scoot closer.

18:52.858 --> 18:53.958
Let's take a picture.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.292
Oh no, I don't
think we should.

18:55.294 --> 18:56.659
Yeah.

18:56.661 --> 18:57.495
Oh.

18:59.031 --> 19:00.132
Say cheese.

19:02.500 --> 19:03.535
You could be sisters.

19:05.871 --> 19:07.438
Now my supper's burning.

19:07.440 --> 19:10.608
So Jimmy, tell
me what do you do?

19:11.810 --> 19:14.445
Well sir, I'm a poet.

19:14.447 --> 19:16.981
Ah, I'm a
mortician myself.

19:16.983 --> 19:20.783
Wow how do you
end up morticianing?

19:20.785 --> 19:23.854
Well let's see after the
navy, I ended up applying

19:23.856 --> 19:27.224
and then flunking out of medical
school then nursing school,

19:27.226 --> 19:29.193
then a lot of other schools,

19:29.195 --> 19:30.593
eventually I
couldn't even get in.

19:30.595 --> 19:34.198
And then luckily the
school for the funeral arts

19:34.200 --> 19:37.935
was accepting everybody and
one thing led to another

19:37.937 --> 19:40.270
and now pure bliss.

19:40.272 --> 19:43.007
Gee, what a gas huh?

19:43.009 --> 19:44.509
Yes, what a gas.

19:46.479 --> 19:51.484
So James, poetry
you say it for a job?

19:54.987 --> 19:56.554
You can do it as a job?

19:58.157 --> 20:01.394
Oh, which
reminds me sweetie.

20:02.495 --> 20:03.496
I got you something.

20:05.931 --> 20:08.000
Look at me shaking.

20:09.268 --> 20:11.669
Woo, my Susie Q,

20:12.804 --> 20:15.705
- with eyes so blue.
- Her eyes are brown.

20:15.707 --> 20:18.878
Your heart so
tender, skin so soft,

20:20.112 --> 20:23.780
forever true, my
love will be for you,

20:23.782 --> 20:26.318
my sweet Susie Q.

20:28.354 --> 20:31.723
That's the most romantic
thing I've ever heard.

20:32.858 --> 20:34.224
Help me.

20:34.226 --> 20:35.294
- You like it?
- Yes.

20:36.661 --> 20:37.629
- Yeah.
- Oh!

20:39.265 --> 20:41.300
Just look at them.

20:45.504 --> 20:46.571
Poetry is power.

20:48.706 --> 20:49.508
Oh dear.

21:00.419 --> 21:02.319
You like it?

21:02.321 --> 21:04.521
Oh they're really
going for it?

21:07.759 --> 21:10.461
Darling, darling,
it's all right,

21:10.463 --> 21:13.197
over here, over
here, over here, yes,

21:13.199 --> 21:15.267
all right see yes.

21:18.003 --> 21:19.804
Oh, shall we eat?

21:25.945 --> 21:27.144
Do you need help dear?

21:27.146 --> 21:28.180
No, I'm fine honey.

21:36.856 --> 21:39.857
Uncle Bob, can
I see the photos?

21:39.859 --> 21:43.529
Oh of course, what do
you think of my handiwork?

21:48.367 --> 21:49.535
That's weird.

21:51.137 --> 21:53.470
Dad, you're not in
any of the photos.

21:57.176 --> 21:58.475
That is very strange.

21:58.477 --> 22:00.776
You know what
that probably is.

22:00.778 --> 22:03.413
I bought this film
from a carnival worker

22:03.415 --> 22:06.016
and you cannot trust them.

22:06.018 --> 22:07.719
Have you ever
seen such a thing?

22:08.820 --> 22:09.819
No.

22:09.821 --> 22:11.157
Maybe your dad's a vampire.

22:13.592 --> 22:15.359
That's so funny.

22:20.533 --> 22:22.966
The reason that she's
laughing so boisterously

22:22.968 --> 22:26.170
is because there's no reason
he could be a vampire.

22:26.172 --> 22:30.040
No, if that were true, all
of us would be lying to you

22:30.042 --> 22:31.743
and keeping a huge secret.

22:33.179 --> 22:34.611
Well you know what they say,

22:34.613 --> 22:38.714
vampires can't be seen in photos
because they have no soul.

22:38.716 --> 22:39.983
I didn't know that.

22:39.985 --> 22:41.985
- Yeah, I read that.
- I read that too.

22:41.987 --> 22:45.189
Here you go, you go
ahead and get started dear,

22:45.191 --> 22:46.156
I'll be right back.

22:46.158 --> 22:50.127
Yes dear.

22:50.129 --> 22:51.628
Dad are you all right?

22:51.630 --> 22:55.798
Yes, yes, just managed
to pinch a nerve didn't I?

22:55.800 --> 22:58.368
Cover that up so
nobody can see it.

22:58.370 --> 23:02.374
Hey hi, so how did you
two lovebirds meet?

23:03.509 --> 23:05.509
In chemistry class.

23:05.511 --> 23:08.078
Chemistry, do
you like chemistry?

23:08.080 --> 23:09.812
Oh yeah, it's neat.

23:09.814 --> 23:11.747
I flunked four times,

23:11.749 --> 23:14.985
but Susie's been really
good helping me out.

23:14.987 --> 23:17.654
She's really helping me
get the hang of it now.

23:17.656 --> 23:18.624
She's really smart.

23:19.592 --> 23:21.291
She is smart, like her mother.

23:21.293 --> 23:24.228
Oh thank you dear.

23:24.230 --> 23:26.131
Yes please, oh yeah.

23:28.033 --> 23:31.335
Here's to a family
with no secrets.

23:31.337 --> 23:32.171
No.

23:39.245 --> 23:41.146
I think this is your dad's.

23:42.348 --> 23:45.951
Oh look at that, it's
your special wine dear.

23:49.188 --> 23:54.193
It's divine, aged to
perfection as they say.

23:55.694 --> 23:58.362
- Can I try some?
- No, no you may not dear.

23:58.364 --> 23:59.398
You drink your water.

24:00.299 --> 24:01.498
Eat your loaf.

24:01.500 --> 24:02.334
Okay.

24:07.640 --> 24:12.109
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

24:12.111 --> 24:16.747
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

24:16.749 --> 24:21.754
♪ Happy birthday dear Susie ♪

24:23.022 --> 24:26.358
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

24:29.328 --> 24:33.230
Happy birthday.

25:59.618 --> 26:00.650
Oh.

26:00.652 --> 26:02.119
Is that how welcome
all your new patients?

26:02.121 --> 26:03.120
The kick?

26:03.122 --> 26:04.354
Who are you?

26:04.356 --> 26:06.690
I'm Oliver, I'm here
to see Dr. Walenski.

26:06.692 --> 26:09.726
- Oh yes yes.
- Oh Dr. Walenski.

26:09.728 --> 26:10.862
I was referred by Vicky.

26:10.864 --> 26:12.429
Wonderful, please
have a seat over here.

26:12.431 --> 26:15.565
- Okay okay.
- Please walk forward,

26:15.567 --> 26:17.503
lie down on the couch.

26:19.605 --> 26:20.537
Raymond!

26:20.539 --> 26:22.806
My love, my sweet darling.

26:22.808 --> 26:24.810
I assure I'll
explain everything,

26:26.178 --> 26:30.514
but for now could you
please give us some privacy?

26:30.516 --> 26:32.215
Let the doctor do his work.

26:32.217 --> 26:33.049
Privacy?

26:33.051 --> 26:33.919
Yes dear.

26:36.989 --> 26:41.224
Bats flying around in my
house, Susie where are you?

26:41.226 --> 26:43.228
How are we gonna
help this creature?

26:44.396 --> 26:46.129
Get out Bob.

26:46.131 --> 26:47.299
That sounds wise.

27:02.548 --> 27:03.615
Shall we begin?

27:04.884 --> 27:06.283
Is that a trick question?

27:06.285 --> 27:07.517
I feel like that's
a trick question.

27:07.519 --> 27:09.288
I feel like you're
trying to trick me.

27:10.622 --> 27:12.322
You're just like all the others

27:12.324 --> 27:14.124
and by the others I mean dad,

27:14.126 --> 27:16.226
and by dad I mean my father

27:16.228 --> 27:18.361
and by father I mean my papa.

27:18.363 --> 27:19.596
You want to know something?

27:19.598 --> 27:21.331
You want to know my
father said to me.

27:21.333 --> 27:25.368
He goes, "Humans no
matter where they're from,

27:25.370 --> 27:28.138
"they can all do one
thing really well.

27:28.140 --> 27:30.140
"They can all die.

27:30.142 --> 27:31.909
"You know what you can't do son?

27:31.911 --> 27:33.278
"You can't die."

27:34.313 --> 27:36.748
How did that make you feel?

27:38.484 --> 27:40.217
Clearly, I'm not comfortable.

27:40.219 --> 27:42.619
I'm not comfortable with myself,

27:42.621 --> 27:44.122
which is really the problem.

27:45.691 --> 27:47.257
Yeah, you want to
know what it is?

27:47.259 --> 27:49.061
Okay, great question,
I'll tell you.

27:50.462 --> 27:53.898
I don't like myself and I
definitely don't love myself,

27:53.900 --> 27:57.469
so there you go, so how do
you fix that in one session?

28:06.678 --> 28:08.678
This isn't people
stuck on an island.

28:08.680 --> 28:10.113
From
the depths of evil

28:10.115 --> 28:13.085
comes the diabolic killer
of beautiful women.

28:14.386 --> 28:16.219
That's not good.

28:26.632 --> 28:29.599
It's in
the vampire's coffin.

28:29.601 --> 28:30.602
Oh Raydog.

28:33.705 --> 28:35.541
Is that Bob I smell?

28:36.441 --> 28:39.075
Oh.

28:39.077 --> 28:41.913
Oh, you're on all the
channels, that's neat.

28:41.915 --> 28:45.651
Embrace the darkness or
else there will be no light.

28:52.624 --> 28:55.694
No no, no no no no no no no.

28:56.628 --> 29:01.633
Hmm.

29:42.608 --> 29:44.842
Hey, you don't
look too good buddy.

29:44.844 --> 29:45.777
What's going on?

29:46.879 --> 29:48.311
Where's Natasha?

29:48.313 --> 29:49.648
She took Susie to school.

29:52.718 --> 29:55.287
Okay open up what's going on?

29:56.321 --> 29:57.489
I ate Betty's dog.

29:58.690 --> 30:03.662
Ah, it is a good thing
you are my best friend.

30:06.665 --> 30:09.132
I bet she'll need
someone to comfort her.

30:09.134 --> 30:11.201
Okay, always a bright side.

30:11.203 --> 30:14.337
I feel very sick.

30:14.339 --> 30:17.240
Yeah, well vampires aren't
supposed to eat animals.

30:17.242 --> 30:19.112
How am I supposed
to know that Bob?

30:20.812 --> 30:21.912
It's common knowledge.

30:21.914 --> 30:23.281
Really go to the library.

30:26.953 --> 30:28.251
Susie is home.

30:28.253 --> 30:29.889
I thought you said
she was at school.

30:33.392 --> 30:36.027
Oh my angel what
are you doing home?

30:36.029 --> 30:37.260
Hi hey.

30:37.262 --> 30:38.998
What are you two
doing, is that blood?

30:40.399 --> 30:44.937
Uncle Bob is conducting
experiments for work with blood.

30:47.940 --> 30:49.172
Uh huh.

30:49.174 --> 30:50.676
- Oh, that's gross.
- Disgusting.

30:51.643 --> 30:52.943
But is it?

30:52.945 --> 30:57.915
I'm thinking of these as dolls.

30:57.917 --> 31:00.385
I'm gonna call
them blood buddies.

31:01.520 --> 31:04.922
This one is Margaret,
she's a musician.

31:04.924 --> 31:06.723
This one, what did
you name this one?

31:06.725 --> 31:07.526
Ed.

31:08.427 --> 31:09.793
I just forgot my book bag.

31:09.795 --> 31:11.329
Oh, there it is
right there sweetheart.

31:13.198 --> 31:14.999
- Good cover buddy.
- Have a good day Uncle Bob.

31:15.001 --> 31:15.667
You too kiddo.

31:19.805 --> 31:21.306
You two should kiss.

31:22.708 --> 31:24.141
Honey, I know things have been

31:24.143 --> 31:25.275
different the last two weeks.

31:25.277 --> 31:26.776
I know we haven't gotten
much time to spend together.

31:26.778 --> 31:28.378
That's okay.

31:28.380 --> 31:29.379
How are you feeling?

31:29.381 --> 31:32.617
Oh wonderful, just peachy.

31:34.120 --> 31:35.121
- Dad?
- Hmm?

31:36.321 --> 31:38.488
Is there a cure for
hypermemisangrivadarum?

31:38.490 --> 31:41.491
Oh, hypermesisgravi,
gravi, no.

31:41.493 --> 31:42.594
No, I'm afraid not.

31:45.164 --> 31:46.165
Are you gonna die?

31:47.133 --> 31:48.598
Oh no.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.102
Oh, oh I'm so glad.

31:51.104 --> 31:52.138
I was really worried.

31:55.273 --> 31:56.175
Were you now?

31:58.211 --> 32:00.177
Of course I love you dad.

32:00.179 --> 32:02.847
Oh, I love you too sweetheart.

32:03.482 --> 32:04.982
Oh, I'm gonna be late.

32:04.984 --> 32:05.852
Oh yes of course.

32:09.688 --> 32:13.792
Sorry about that it
was a little dramatic.

32:15.260 --> 32:16.626
I'm sorry I forgot about the...

32:16.628 --> 32:18.062
Oh no, no no no off you go.

32:18.064 --> 32:20.599
- Are you okay?
- Yes wonderful.

32:22.001 --> 32:24.734
Little hot under the
collar so they say.

32:24.736 --> 32:26.803
Off you go, have a great day.

32:26.805 --> 32:27.838
Okay, watch out, sorry.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.775
Yes, yes, off you go.

32:33.378 --> 32:35.447
I'll be here, just
call if you need me.

32:37.816 --> 32:38.683
Honey, ice pack.

32:57.803 --> 33:02.239
Oh God, Bob, don't you
have to work or something?

33:02.241 --> 33:03.406
For goodness sake.

33:03.408 --> 33:05.341
You know the beauty with
working with the dead is

33:05.343 --> 33:07.479
they never know if
you're blowing off work.

33:08.881 --> 33:12.149
Listen, the ladies are coming
over for bridge any minute.

33:12.151 --> 33:14.921
Hey, speaking of that,
Betty is coming yes?

33:16.289 --> 33:17.620
Yes.

33:18.925 --> 33:19.857
Oh, that's them.

33:19.859 --> 33:21.826
Promise you won't embarrass me.

33:21.828 --> 33:23.528
Sis, it's me.

33:26.331 --> 33:27.797
Can you pick these up for me?

33:27.799 --> 33:28.633
Bob!

33:31.304 --> 33:32.404
I need grapes.

33:35.274 --> 33:36.907
We have some lovely cocktails

33:36.909 --> 33:38.775
prepared for you
ladies this evening.

33:38.777 --> 33:39.912
- Thank you.
- Lovely.

33:41.379 --> 33:43.249
So why the blackout
curtains Natasha?

33:44.349 --> 33:46.317
Well haven't you heard?

33:46.319 --> 33:49.552
It's the latest thing to
prevent premature aging.

33:49.554 --> 33:51.721
Yes I just hung
them a few weeks ago

33:51.723 --> 33:53.590
and I already feel
years younger.

33:53.592 --> 33:56.492
Well you do look
wonderful Natasha.

33:56.494 --> 33:58.863
I'm so worried.

33:58.865 --> 34:02.233
My little Ginger didn't
come home last night.

34:02.235 --> 34:04.034
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.

34:04.036 --> 34:05.768
- Perhaps she's in heat.
- Yes.

34:05.770 --> 34:08.906
Animals have a very
strong urge to mate.

34:08.908 --> 34:10.806
No no no, I'm telling you

34:10.809 --> 34:12.510
that there's
something not right.

34:13.880 --> 34:17.281
I'm certain I saw a man lurking
around my house last night.

34:17.283 --> 34:18.447
Oh Betty, come on,

34:18.449 --> 34:19.815
now this is a perfectly
safe neighborhood.

34:19.818 --> 34:21.886
What if there's a predator?

34:21.888 --> 34:22.819
I live alone.

34:22.821 --> 34:25.089
Who's going to protect me?

34:25.091 --> 34:27.324
Probably Mr.
Peters, they tell you

34:27.326 --> 34:29.626
he tried to look up my
skirt the other day?

34:29.628 --> 34:31.393
Horny old man!

34:31.396 --> 34:33.030
Ah, here we are!

34:33.032 --> 34:36.936
Oh goodness me, I forgot to
take your coats, how silly!

34:38.137 --> 34:40.472
Thank you, thank
you, there we are.

34:42.007 --> 34:43.074
There we are.

34:46.312 --> 34:47.543
Hello.

34:47.545 --> 34:49.382
Oh, hi.

34:54.353 --> 34:56.987
Jane, Mary, this
is my brother Bob.

34:56.989 --> 34:58.188
He's visiting.

34:58.190 --> 34:59.722
- Hey Bob.
- Hello.

34:59.724 --> 35:00.826
Hi.

35:02.261 --> 35:03.428
Hello again.

35:06.332 --> 35:08.533
Would you ladies
care for a drink?

35:09.434 --> 35:10.301
I'd love that.

35:10.303 --> 35:11.404
- Yes, please.
- Yes.

35:12.271 --> 35:13.105
Just hold on.

35:15.807 --> 35:17.910
He's a dreamboat,
an absolute dreamboat.

35:19.412 --> 35:20.344
- Betty.
- Betty.

35:20.346 --> 35:22.079
- Your cards.
- Oh yes.

35:22.081 --> 35:23.113
Let's play the game.

35:23.115 --> 35:25.082
That's why we're here.

35:25.084 --> 35:26.582
- That's right.
- Yes.

35:26.584 --> 35:27.420
Dreadful hand.

35:37.729 --> 35:38.831
- Bob.
- Yeah?

35:40.598 --> 35:41.798
Is that your doing?

35:41.800 --> 35:42.734
Is what my doing?

35:43.936 --> 35:46.736
Betty's dead dog
is in the closet.

35:46.738 --> 35:49.006
Oh, so that's where he put it.

35:49.008 --> 35:50.040
And you knew about this?

35:50.042 --> 35:51.474
Of course I knew.

35:51.476 --> 35:55.712
God, all right,
just act normal.

35:55.714 --> 35:57.416
- I always do.
- Go be normal.

36:00.086 --> 36:02.585
How are we doing here?

36:02.587 --> 36:05.923
Oh Raymond, may I
have a word with you?

36:05.925 --> 36:06.826
Excuse me.

36:12.031 --> 36:16.435
Raymond, what is Betty's
dead dog in the coat closet?

36:22.341 --> 36:24.008
I'm sorry honey.

36:28.546 --> 36:31.248
Raymond, how could you?

36:31.250 --> 36:32.983
It's so annoying how
it barked all the time.

36:32.985 --> 36:34.153
I couldn't help myself.

36:37.822 --> 36:41.861
Raymond, you cannot go
around biting people's dogs.

36:43.195 --> 36:45.996
What if people get suspicious?

36:45.998 --> 36:48.234
Yes, no more pets.

36:49.368 --> 36:51.636
And just so you know
it made me really sick.

36:59.979 --> 37:00.880
Good, oh.

37:03.648 --> 37:04.483
Thank you dear.

37:07.486 --> 37:12.491
Well.

37:23.469 --> 37:24.303
Okay.

37:25.838 --> 37:26.771
For milady.

37:27.940 --> 37:30.543
It's beautiful, so
festive and you three.

37:32.244 --> 37:34.078
It's lovely, mahalo.

37:34.080 --> 37:34.914
Mahalo.

37:36.115 --> 37:39.749
Natasha tells me that
you're a mortician.

37:39.751 --> 37:42.785
Indeed I am, I perform
the funeral arts.

37:42.787 --> 37:45.255
Oh, that's where
I know you from.

37:45.257 --> 37:47.657
You dealt with my
late husband Mort.

37:47.659 --> 37:50.129
I see so many dead
bodies I don't know.

37:51.297 --> 37:53.130
Well you did, you
were the only in town

37:53.132 --> 37:55.367
and you made him look
30 years younger.

37:57.169 --> 38:00.072
I guess I have a talent,
but I'll tell you the secret,

38:01.006 --> 38:02.072
a little bit of coconut oil,

38:02.074 --> 38:03.173
- stop it.
- Stop it.

38:03.175 --> 38:04.541
- Coconut oil and...
- Stop it.

38:04.543 --> 38:07.444
And a luffa does wonders.

38:07.446 --> 38:08.879
Well I know I'm not dead yet,

38:08.881 --> 38:10.815
but could you do that for me?

38:12.952 --> 38:15.818
What, I want to
look 30 years younger.

38:15.820 --> 38:18.257
It's a luffa,
not a magic wand.

38:20.593 --> 38:25.598
Oh Natasha you must feel
so safe living in this house

38:26.731 --> 38:28.298
with two strong
men to protect you.

38:28.300 --> 38:29.135
Oh.

38:30.635 --> 38:31.835
Eh?

38:31.837 --> 38:33.003
Yes, yes.

38:33.005 --> 38:34.238
She does.

38:34.240 --> 38:37.274
You know my dog
Ginger that you met?

38:37.276 --> 38:41.445
She's missing and I'm certain
that a prowler took her.

38:41.447 --> 38:43.715
Ginger was a fantastic beast.

38:45.084 --> 38:49.588
It's probably just a coyote
or a ravenous raccoon.

38:50.655 --> 38:52.790
You know what why don't we
just play the game shall we?

38:53.725 --> 38:54.994
No trump in this round.

38:55.895 --> 38:57.861
I live alone you know.

38:57.863 --> 39:00.796
Oh, I didn't know that.

39:00.798 --> 39:03.135
- Yes.
- No husbands or lovers?

39:04.069 --> 39:05.836
Not at the moment.

39:05.838 --> 39:08.839
Oh, well if you'd
like I could come over

39:08.841 --> 39:13.846
and help check your
locks and your windows.

39:14.413 --> 39:15.245
I'd like that.

39:15.247 --> 39:16.081
You would?

39:17.183 --> 39:19.652
You know you
have very kind eyes

39:20.953 --> 39:24.021
and your fluffy beard
it's just beautiful.

39:24.023 --> 39:26.722
You remind me of someone.

39:26.724 --> 39:27.560
Ginger?

39:28.928 --> 39:33.630
I was thinking more
like a cross between

39:33.632 --> 39:37.036
Santa Claus and Frankie Avalon.

39:37.903 --> 39:39.138
I think it's your turn.

39:40.506 --> 39:42.738
She's got a seven, a
four, two nines and a jack.

39:42.740 --> 39:44.374
- Oh!
- God sake!

39:44.376 --> 39:46.843
- Ruin the game!
- Betty.

39:46.845 --> 39:49.745
- You're up.
- Cinnamon roll anyone?

39:49.747 --> 39:51.884
- Yes thank you.
- No thank you.

39:52.750 --> 39:55.619
He makes a wonderful cocktail.

39:55.621 --> 39:57.722
He's a dreamboat,
an absolute dreamboat.

39:59.258 --> 40:00.626
Yes, I've been told.

40:10.302 --> 40:11.136
Dad?

40:12.737 --> 40:13.937
Oh hi sweetie.

40:13.939 --> 40:16.139
- Hello.
- How was your day?

40:16.141 --> 40:17.343
Oh it was really good.

40:19.311 --> 40:20.679
That's a really nice tie.

40:22.014 --> 40:24.281
Oh, oh yes.

40:24.283 --> 40:27.551
Yes it is, not my
favorite, but...

40:27.553 --> 40:29.453
It looks really good on you.

40:29.455 --> 40:31.789
Oh, well maybe I'll
wear it more often.

40:34.226 --> 40:36.629
Did you need help
with your homework?

40:37.863 --> 40:41.367
No, I just wanted
to talk with you.

40:42.968 --> 40:44.737
Oh, yes of course.

40:46.305 --> 40:47.504
What is it sweetie?

40:47.506 --> 40:52.111
So you talk to people
and you help them

40:53.312 --> 40:56.812
with relationships
and their feelings

40:56.814 --> 41:01.819
and how that all works together.

41:02.955 --> 41:06.859
And this is really
embarrassing actually,

41:09.228 --> 41:10.095
it's about sex.

41:20.673 --> 41:21.972
Sex?

41:21.974 --> 41:22.841
Yes.

41:24.543 --> 41:28.312
I know a kid doesn't
normally talk to a parent

41:28.314 --> 41:29.980
about this kind of thing,

41:29.982 --> 41:32.582
but since you are a doctor,

41:32.584 --> 41:37.287
I was thinking you
could see me as a client

41:37.289 --> 41:41.126
and you could give
me your advice.

41:42.261 --> 41:46.932
Hmm, does Jimmy want to have

41:49.702 --> 41:50.967
with you?

41:50.969 --> 41:52.602
That's just the thing.

41:52.604 --> 41:55.939
He thinks we should wait
and I don't understand why.

41:55.941 --> 41:58.308
Perhaps it's because
he could go to jail

41:58.310 --> 42:00.510
for a very long
time, it's illegal.

42:00.512 --> 42:02.045
- Dad.
- He's breaking the law.

42:02.047 --> 42:03.780
- Dad.
- You are far too young

42:03.782 --> 42:07.451
to be thinking about these
types of things with boys.

42:07.453 --> 42:10.020
I am not too young.

42:10.022 --> 42:11.822
You are 12 years old.

42:11.824 --> 42:13.323
I am 16 years old.

42:13.325 --> 42:14.593
I just had a birthday.

42:16.195 --> 42:17.429
Happy birthday to you.

42:19.031 --> 42:20.564
You don't understand.

42:20.566 --> 42:22.866
Has he married you, do you
have a ring on your finger?

42:22.868 --> 42:24.000
- Well no.
- Exactly.

42:24.002 --> 42:25.837
- No, but I...
- You consummate

42:25.839 --> 42:27.437
- upon marriage.
- I thought you

42:27.439 --> 42:29.239
of all people would
understand this.

42:29.241 --> 42:32.209
I know that you think
he's a nice young man.

42:32.211 --> 42:33.312
- He is.
- But there are

42:34.446 --> 42:35.946
a lot of nice young
men in the world

42:35.948 --> 42:40.386
and you don't give this thing
to the first one you meet.

42:42.254 --> 42:43.855
Mom did.

42:43.857 --> 42:44.858
That was different.

42:45.724 --> 42:46.723
No it's not.

42:46.725 --> 42:47.557
How is it different?

42:47.559 --> 42:48.425
We were in love.

42:48.427 --> 42:49.326
We are in love.

42:49.328 --> 42:50.394
We love each other.

42:50.396 --> 42:52.396
She loves me and I love her.

42:52.398 --> 42:53.230
We are in love.

42:53.232 --> 42:54.197
You are not in love.

42:54.199 --> 42:55.031
You go to your room.

42:55.033 --> 42:57.734
You are so wrong.

42:57.736 --> 43:00.840
Go to your room,
come back here, uh,

43:02.274 --> 43:04.141
we'll continue this later.

43:04.143 --> 43:05.411
Okay honey good talk.

43:10.716 --> 43:15.721
Love, capital L, love, oh.

43:20.225 --> 43:21.393
Oh, my love.

43:22.928 --> 43:24.294
Are you all right dear?

43:24.296 --> 43:26.064
- Not really.
- Oh my.

43:27.533 --> 43:29.099
You seem flush darling.

43:29.101 --> 43:33.103
Here take this off, here
let me help you with that.

43:33.105 --> 43:34.773
Thank you my dear.

43:36.074 --> 43:38.043
We'll just set it
here for now all right.

43:39.344 --> 43:43.549
Wait a minute,
Raymond, what did you do?

43:44.450 --> 43:46.016
Oh nothing.

43:46.018 --> 43:47.184
I don't believe you.

43:47.186 --> 43:48.320
I know that face.

43:51.156 --> 43:51.990
It's Susie.

43:53.525 --> 43:54.660
- You bit Susie?
- No.

43:56.295 --> 43:57.127
I wouldn't do that.

43:57.129 --> 43:58.297
She is our daughter.

44:01.200 --> 44:05.003
She tried to talk
to me about sex.

44:07.272 --> 44:08.371
Sex?

44:08.373 --> 44:11.541
I was completely unprepared.

44:11.543 --> 44:14.511
Oh, my poor little sweet

44:14.513 --> 44:17.149
innocent angel
princess doll Susie.

44:18.550 --> 44:20.219
I'm going to kill
that boyfriend.

44:21.855 --> 44:25.255
Susie, Susie come
down here right now.

44:25.257 --> 44:27.859
Natasha, Natasha, that
will only make things worse.

44:27.861 --> 44:31.161
Oh my poor little Susie
going out with that poet.

44:35.234 --> 44:36.068
Wait here.

44:44.109 --> 44:45.509
Oh for heaven's sakes.

44:45.511 --> 44:46.409
Did you need something mom?

44:46.411 --> 44:47.947
Yes Susie, you and I

44:49.214 --> 44:50.982
we're going to have
a nice little chat.

44:50.984 --> 44:53.216
He told you didn't he?

44:53.218 --> 44:54.818
I hate dad.

44:54.820 --> 44:57.687
Well now don't you talk
about your father that way.

44:57.689 --> 45:00.690
I shared with dad
private, personal things

45:00.692 --> 45:02.359
and instead of treating
me like a client,

45:02.361 --> 45:03.863
he treated me like a child.

45:04.964 --> 45:07.764
Darling, your father
and I both agree

45:07.766 --> 45:10.700
that Jimmy is too old for you.

45:10.702 --> 45:12.738
- He's only 18.
- You're 16.

45:13.739 --> 45:14.740
I love him.

45:15.707 --> 45:16.542
I, I

45:20.178 --> 45:23.948
- Jimmy Jimmy?
- Yes Jimmy.

45:23.950 --> 45:27.117
Oh you know what darling?

45:27.119 --> 45:30.820
You you you should be
patient with your father

45:30.822 --> 45:35.828
because he's been through a
very difficult last few weeks.

45:36.595 --> 45:37.895
I just feel like
he's being difficult.

45:37.897 --> 45:41.600
Yes, yes, I agree, I agree.

45:43.168 --> 45:44.401
I know you don't like Jimmy.

45:44.403 --> 45:47.170
I'm sure that he was
a very nice person.

45:47.172 --> 45:48.505
- Was?
- Is.

45:48.507 --> 45:51.241
When you met daddy was
it love at first sight?

45:51.243 --> 45:55.280
Um, yes actually yes.

45:56.381 --> 45:58.682
It was love at
first sight darling.

45:58.684 --> 46:01.253
Oh so you understand
how I feel for Jimmy?

46:02.187 --> 46:03.219
Oh dear.

46:03.221 --> 46:04.723
Oh oh oh, oh dear.

46:06.491 --> 46:09.561
Oh oh dear.

46:10.729 --> 46:13.665
- Oh ma.
- Oh I'm sorry darling.

46:14.499 --> 46:15.532
It's okay mom.

46:15.534 --> 46:19.538
Oh goodness no, I just...

46:21.206 --> 46:22.706
It's okay mom.

46:22.708 --> 46:25.809
I know, I'm sorry dear,
I just love you so much.

46:25.811 --> 46:29.312
I just want to hold you
for a moment longer.

46:29.314 --> 46:31.314
Okay, that's all
right, there we are,

46:31.316 --> 46:33.183
that's fine, I'm fine now.

46:33.185 --> 46:34.119
I'm fine now.

46:35.120 --> 46:37.120
I'm so glad we had this talk.

46:37.122 --> 46:42.127
Yes, it was a very nice
talk, wasn't it dear?

46:43.328 --> 46:45.729
Yes, yes, I feel
better thank you.

46:45.731 --> 46:48.131
Me too all right
why don't you go

46:48.133 --> 46:50.700
and lay that lovely,
perfect head of yours

46:50.702 --> 46:52.469
on that pillow upstairs
in your bedroom?

46:52.471 --> 46:53.603
- Good night mom.
- All right,

46:53.605 --> 46:55.407
- good night dear.
- Good night.

47:04.783 --> 47:06.019
Raymond Walenski.

47:12.190 --> 47:13.291
It's not what you think.

47:14.793 --> 47:17.128
Actually it is what you think.

47:17.130 --> 47:20.031
I found him sneaking into
Susie's bedroom window.

47:20.033 --> 47:22.833
Oh God, what is our
daughter Susie going to think

47:22.835 --> 47:25.036
when she finds out that
you killed her boyfriend?

47:25.038 --> 47:26.405
I didn't kill him.

47:27.840 --> 47:31.341
I was biting him, then I came
to my senses just in time.

47:31.343 --> 47:33.911
Oh God, oh this is awful.

47:33.913 --> 47:35.645
Raymond, this is just awful.

47:35.647 --> 47:36.981
What are we going to do

47:36.983 --> 47:38.583
when he turns into
a vampire Raymond?

47:42.922 --> 47:44.454
I didn't think about it.

47:44.456 --> 47:46.059
No you didn't think
about that did you?

47:48.193 --> 47:49.528
Ha, that Betty is
something else huh?

47:53.833 --> 47:56.000
Oh, come on guys, look I know

47:56.002 --> 47:58.836
she's a little bit older right

47:58.838 --> 48:00.739
and she's your
neighbor but I promise

48:01.908 --> 48:04.407
boy I am keen over
that peachy pie

48:04.409 --> 48:05.809
and I'm not gonna
screw the pooch.

48:05.811 --> 48:07.343
I'm gonna take care of
her because I love her.

48:07.345 --> 48:09.847
God, Bob, can't you
stop talking about Betty?

48:09.849 --> 48:12.085
Can't you we've got
real problems here?

48:13.485 --> 48:14.619
What happened?

48:15.955 --> 48:17.287
I bit Jimmy.

48:17.289 --> 48:18.356
You bit Jimmy?

48:19.224 --> 48:20.223
He's in the closet.

48:20.225 --> 48:21.758
He's in the closet?

48:21.760 --> 48:23.460
- Turning into a vampire.
- Turning into a vampire?

48:23.462 --> 48:25.562
- Susie doesn't know.
- Susie doesn't know.

48:25.564 --> 48:27.464
Would you both just stop that?

48:27.466 --> 48:29.265
Just help us please.

48:29.267 --> 48:30.602
Well this is a pickle.

48:33.538 --> 48:36.608
Okay, okay.

48:37.709 --> 48:40.243
Okay, here's what's
gonna happen.

48:40.245 --> 48:41.444
We're gonna be fine.

48:41.446 --> 48:44.314
We just have to
keep up appearances.

48:44.316 --> 48:48.221
And that's why we are gonna
throw a cocktail party.

48:50.789 --> 48:52.255
Oh.

48:56.261 --> 48:59.031
Me flapjacks,
making flapjacks.

49:01.433 --> 49:06.438
Everything looks lovely, lovely.

49:07.305 --> 49:09.339
Oh, good morning sweetheart.

49:09.341 --> 49:10.176
Good morning.

49:11.643 --> 49:15.212
I have your book
bag all ready for you

49:15.214 --> 49:16.713
and alphabetized by your books,

49:16.715 --> 49:20.119
looked over you algebra,
wonderful, great job, so.

49:21.220 --> 49:22.387
Where's mom?

49:23.488 --> 49:26.190
She's feeling a
little under the weather

49:26.192 --> 49:30.560
with the month things.

49:30.562 --> 49:34.167
So you'll learn all about
it in college university.

49:36.102 --> 49:38.169
Sorry I got mad
at you last night.

49:38.171 --> 49:42.275
No no no, I'm
sorry you came to me

49:43.441 --> 49:45.510
seeking advice from a
medical professional

49:46.678 --> 49:49.579
and there I was acting
like a crazy father.

49:49.581 --> 49:50.582
I understand.

49:52.185 --> 49:57.190
I just I really want you and
mom to give Jimmy a chance.

49:58.356 --> 50:02.727
He's sweet and funny and
wonderful and marvelous.

50:04.030 --> 50:06.698
Oh we just want
you to be happy.

50:08.567 --> 50:09.401
Than you daddy.

50:13.906 --> 50:16.207
What was that?

50:16.209 --> 50:17.208
Nothing.

50:19.245 --> 50:23.981
That was your mother
vacuuming yet again,

50:23.983 --> 50:26.349
she's a vacuumer, always
vacuuming that one.

50:26.351 --> 50:31.324
So we are going to get
you your breakfast.

50:32.225 --> 50:35.326
I made you a fork, just use that

50:35.328 --> 50:36.759
and then just take
a little sip there,

50:36.761 --> 50:38.297
get your vitamin C and calcium.

50:39.731 --> 50:42.400
Mm, yummy yum, gee, yum.

50:43.368 --> 50:44.634
Thank you.

50:44.636 --> 50:46.270
Okay, off you go.

50:46.272 --> 50:47.073
Thanks dad.

50:48.540 --> 50:50.809
Love you, tear it and eat
away, chomp chomp-a-roo.

51:10.595 --> 51:15.001
How long has it been since
you were transformed?

51:16.035 --> 51:17.835
Three months ago I was normal.

51:17.837 --> 51:19.502
I was smaller.

51:19.504 --> 51:21.038
I didn't have all this
hair and these teeth.

51:21.040 --> 51:23.307
And now I'm eating people.

51:23.309 --> 51:27.677
I just I just have no life.

51:27.679 --> 51:32.684
Oh well I there must
be something positive

51:33.451 --> 51:35.853
about your existence.

51:35.855 --> 51:37.455
It's really hard to go home.

51:38.958 --> 51:43.160
My family, my wife, my
daughter, I love that bitch.

51:43.162 --> 51:44.096
I'm still a dad.

51:46.564 --> 51:48.798
Have they accepted you?

51:48.800 --> 51:50.334
Well I don't think
they have a choice.

51:50.336 --> 51:51.969
I pay the bills.

51:51.971 --> 51:54.373
- Oh, that's good.
- My wife does not work.

51:56.541 --> 51:59.611
Pain in my ass, but I love her.

52:01.380 --> 52:02.379
I love her.

52:02.381 --> 52:03.513
I have nobody.

52:03.515 --> 52:04.447
I have nothing.

52:04.449 --> 52:06.083
They just keep me in
my room all the time

52:06.085 --> 52:07.784
and I couldn't even eat anybody.

52:07.786 --> 52:10.720
Brains taste like, oh
God let me tell you

52:10.722 --> 52:13.723
brains taste like
will you assist me?

52:13.725 --> 52:15.092
You're still accounting?

52:15.094 --> 52:17.861
I work from home, so
I don't see my clients.

52:17.863 --> 52:18.864
Oh good.

52:20.299 --> 52:23.233
Well our neighbor saw
me for like five minutes.

52:23.235 --> 52:24.868
- And then?
- He can't see anymore.

52:24.870 --> 52:29.340
Of course, ate his...

52:29.342 --> 52:32.943
Oh man, I have this
sick feeling all the time.

52:32.945 --> 52:34.477
I see okay.

52:34.479 --> 52:38.715
Well William have you tried
the healing power of hypnosis?

52:38.717 --> 52:41.684
Bob.

52:41.686 --> 52:44.321
Go.

52:48.394 --> 52:49.395
So where we?

52:51.964 --> 52:56.934
Sorry that just
comes over you once in a while.

52:56.936 --> 52:59.804
Well, that's all the
time we have for today.

53:00.772 --> 53:04.509
Good session, so off you go.

53:07.079 --> 53:08.147
Do you fly?

53:09.281 --> 53:10.282
No, I walk.

53:12.318 --> 53:14.318
Oh, well off you go.

53:14.320 --> 53:18.489
Oh yeah Raymond you're
getting pretty good at this.

53:18.491 --> 53:20.523
You know that boy is still
in the closet though?

53:20.525 --> 53:22.259
You should probably
go check that one out.

53:22.261 --> 53:24.527
You should have just
finished him off you know.

53:24.529 --> 53:25.829
Hey what are you doing with me?

53:25.831 --> 53:27.632
Put me down, put me down.

53:40.846 --> 53:42.046
What are you writing Bob?

53:42.048 --> 53:44.181
I've been working
on a love poem.

53:44.183 --> 53:45.215
You want to hear it?

53:45.217 --> 53:46.483
No.

53:46.485 --> 53:50.921
My sweet Betty fills
my heart with confetti.

53:50.923 --> 53:55.027
Today can be our time
if you'll only be mine.

53:57.629 --> 54:00.364
What's the matter dear?

54:00.366 --> 54:02.368
Is the rhyme scheme
too complicated?

54:03.469 --> 54:04.767
No.

54:04.769 --> 54:05.703
It's Jimmy.

54:07.206 --> 54:09.806
He hasn't answered
my phone calls.

54:09.808 --> 54:11.377
I haven't seen him in two days.

54:12.777 --> 54:15.179
I think he broke up with me.

54:15.181 --> 54:17.514
Maybe he's sick.

54:17.516 --> 54:19.385
Or he probably
joined the navy.

54:21.253 --> 54:22.486
Daddy?

54:22.488 --> 54:24.955
Can I please borrow the
car to check on him?

54:24.957 --> 54:28.624
Oh I don't know if you
need to leave the house,

54:28.626 --> 54:29.893
plus the car's out of gas.

54:29.895 --> 54:32.029
You shouldn't drive
when you're emotional.

54:32.031 --> 54:33.497
Don't leave the house.

54:35.733 --> 54:38.003
♪ Oh Susie ♪

54:40.072 --> 54:41.004
You know what kiddo?

54:41.006 --> 54:42.339
Let's do get out of here.

54:42.341 --> 54:43.273
Let's get some ice cream.

54:43.275 --> 54:44.942
I'll let you drive the hearse.

54:44.944 --> 54:47.878
That's a wonderful
idea isn't it?

54:47.880 --> 54:48.780
Yes, mm-hmm.

54:51.016 --> 54:53.484
Just let me grab my coat.

54:53.486 --> 54:57.287
No no, wait darling,
don't go in the closet dear,

54:57.289 --> 55:01.158
because your father has just
sprayed for toxic spiders,

55:01.160 --> 55:02.658
isn't that right dear?

55:02.660 --> 55:04.061
Yes dear.

55:04.063 --> 55:07.765
Okay, see, plus you're
already wearing Jimmy's sweater.

55:14.173 --> 55:16.672
Oh dear, he's starting
to turn Raymond.

55:16.674 --> 55:17.877
What are we going to do?

55:19.245 --> 55:20.177
I feel just awful.

55:20.179 --> 55:21.512
I wish I could undo all of this.

55:21.514 --> 55:23.313
Well that doesn't
help us now does it?

55:23.315 --> 55:26.649
Okay come on Raymond,
think think darling.

55:26.651 --> 55:27.987
Oh just give me a moment.

55:35.727 --> 55:38.362
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

55:43.235 --> 55:44.535
Raymond!

55:44.537 --> 55:45.971
What was I supposed to do?

55:47.506 --> 55:48.740
At least he's quiet now.

55:50.409 --> 55:55.414
Raymond, I love you, but I
hardly recognize you anymore.

55:58.217 --> 56:03.187
Well I hardly
recognize myself.

56:11.997 --> 56:16.335
My love, I'm so very sorry.

56:18.703 --> 56:20.671
I know this has
been hard on you.

56:20.673 --> 56:23.042
You've been incredibly
good getting everything.

56:26.545 --> 56:29.315
I just want things to
go back to normal again.

56:30.950 --> 56:34.451
Oh my darling,
of course you do.

56:34.453 --> 56:37.755
And they will, I promise.

56:41.560 --> 56:45.097
Except for werewolves

56:46.632 --> 56:51.070
and the underworld and counseling
the creatures of the night

56:52.972 --> 56:57.977
and bloodsucking and dead
animals and teenagers and well.

57:16.161 --> 57:17.427
Pig in a blanket ladies?

57:17.429 --> 57:21.198
- Oh thank you.
- Thank you so much.

57:21.200 --> 57:22.701
Hello, oh hello.

57:25.571 --> 57:26.737
Pig in a blanket?

57:26.739 --> 57:28.171
Oh, thank you.

57:28.173 --> 57:31.043
Bob, may I speak
to you for a moment?

57:32.444 --> 57:34.878
Sure you mind giving
us a minute here wiggles?

57:34.880 --> 57:35.714
Sure.

57:37.916 --> 57:38.751
Oh wow.

57:40.052 --> 57:41.587
- Wiggles?
- Oh, you better believe it.

57:42.755 --> 57:45.022
- Where's Raymond?
- I don't know.

57:45.024 --> 57:46.690
Well where could he be?

57:46.692 --> 57:49.226
Hello everyone,
sorry I'm late.

57:49.228 --> 57:50.462
Oh hello darling.

57:51.497 --> 57:53.530
Where have you been?

57:53.532 --> 57:55.532
Bob, may I borrow your hearse?

57:55.534 --> 57:57.534
- You bet.
- Hearse,

57:57.536 --> 57:59.303
what did you do dear?

57:59.305 --> 58:00.172
Mr. Peters.

58:02.141 --> 58:03.008
He's in the shed.

58:04.243 --> 58:05.077
No, oh Raymond.

58:06.512 --> 58:08.947
Oh, he was peaking into
Betty's bedroom window.

58:11.417 --> 58:13.252
Bob, I
met a guy named Bob

58:14.620 --> 58:18.991
and he is the most wonderful
man that I've ever seen.

59:00.666 --> 59:03.567
He was peaking into
Betty's bedroom window.

59:03.569 --> 59:04.568
My Betty's window?

59:04.570 --> 59:05.802
That's the one.

59:05.804 --> 59:06.840
Thanks Raydog.

59:07.740 --> 59:08.872
But, but but but right away.

59:08.874 --> 59:09.708
You bet.

59:11.643 --> 59:16.415
Oh oh, Raymond dear, your
base nature is out of control

59:18.852 --> 59:21.587
- my darling.
- Nature, I feel fine.

59:23.021 --> 59:27.190
And white whine for the lady
and a red for the gentleman.

59:27.192 --> 59:28.794
It's a college football player.

59:30.529 --> 59:35.534
A toast to friends.

59:37.269 --> 59:39.970
And neighbors, mm mm mm.

59:39.972 --> 59:41.573
- To friendship.
- To friendship.

59:44.376 --> 59:46.844
Everything
is wonderful Natasha.

59:46.846 --> 59:48.345
Oh thank you Jane.

59:48.347 --> 59:50.180
You must have
spent days cooking.

59:50.182 --> 59:51.917
Oh, it's what I love to do.

59:52.785 --> 59:56.119
Hello, hi mom, hi daddy.

59:56.121 --> 59:58.622
Oh hello sweetheart,
pig in a blanket?

59:58.624 --> 59:59.758
Oh thank you.

01:00:07.933 --> 01:00:10.868
Oh, someone's thirsty.

01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:12.104
I'll be back.

01:00:12.971 --> 01:00:14.638
Oh and she's off.

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.373
You look wonderful dear.

01:00:16.375 --> 01:00:17.209
Oh thank you.

01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:49.272
Sorry Raydio, I forgot the
guy jumped off the bridge

01:00:49.274 --> 01:00:50.877
because he was tripping on LSD.

01:01:02.387 --> 01:01:06.992
Daddy.

01:01:16.635 --> 01:01:21.640
Daddy.

01:01:23.575 --> 01:01:28.580
Roll over.

01:01:29.581 --> 01:01:34.152
Raymond.

01:01:40.359 --> 01:01:44.229
Daddy.

01:01:49.468 --> 01:01:53.637
Oh.

01:01:53.639 --> 01:01:55.572
You can't protect
your girls forever.

01:01:55.574 --> 01:01:58.542
Eventually, Susie will find out.

01:02:02.681 --> 01:02:03.515
Raymond.

01:02:07.653 --> 01:02:09.488
Daddy, I'm pregnant.

01:02:17.129 --> 01:02:19.796
It was you wasn't it?

01:02:19.798 --> 01:02:20.900
Dog murderer!

01:02:22.534 --> 01:02:23.368
Vampire!

01:02:25.103 --> 01:02:30.108
Vampire!

01:02:34.813 --> 01:02:36.179
Oh dear.

01:02:36.181 --> 01:02:39.115
Honey are you all right?

01:02:39.117 --> 01:02:40.586
- Yes just.
- Well.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:44.089
Darling you all right dear?

01:02:45.324 --> 01:02:49.526
Why don't we go and
sit down over here?

01:02:49.528 --> 01:02:52.429
- Yes.
- Why your father

01:02:52.431 --> 01:02:54.968
just had too many pigs
in a blanket that's all.

01:02:57.502 --> 01:02:58.337
Pigs.

01:03:01.975 --> 01:03:03.910
Would you just
stand up really quick?

01:03:06.244 --> 01:03:08.879
Betty what is your last name?

01:03:08.881 --> 01:03:10.347
- Winslow.
- Oh I thought

01:03:10.349 --> 01:03:12.083
it'd be more Jewish.

01:03:12.085 --> 01:03:13.216
No, it's just Winslow.

01:03:13.218 --> 01:03:16.653
Okay, Betty Winslow
will you make me

01:03:16.655 --> 01:03:18.958
the happiest man on
Earth and by my bride?

01:03:20.459 --> 01:03:22.359
- Yes.
- Yes?

01:03:22.361 --> 01:03:27.366
- Yes!
- Yes, okay.

01:03:29.134 --> 01:03:30.667
Susie?

01:03:30.669 --> 01:03:33.037
Jimmy!

01:03:38.243 --> 01:03:42.345
Don't bite me!

01:03:42.347 --> 01:03:46.117
No.

01:03:46.119 --> 01:03:47.252
No, Susie!

01:03:56.228 --> 01:04:00.632
Now I can explain everything.

01:04:02.534 --> 01:04:05.069
Now I know this may
seem bizarre for you,

01:04:05.071 --> 01:04:07.637
the whole vampire
thing, but really dear

01:04:07.639 --> 01:04:10.175
it is quite miraculous.

01:04:11.476 --> 01:04:14.912
Your father was
handpicked by yours truly

01:04:14.914 --> 01:04:18.517
and he is a very
special, a very great man

01:04:19.886 --> 01:04:23.022
and us creatures of the
underworld, well we need him.

01:04:24.423 --> 01:04:28.125
So if you promise not to scream,

01:04:28.127 --> 01:04:30.161
I'll promise not you bite you.

01:04:30.163 --> 01:04:30.997
Sound good?

01:04:32.899 --> 01:04:33.699
Great.

01:04:35.801 --> 01:04:38.035
Handpicked, for what why?

01:04:38.037 --> 01:04:39.335
Well your father's
been treating us

01:04:39.337 --> 01:04:42.274
with our emotional well-being.

01:04:44.043 --> 01:04:45.809
Monsters are real.

01:04:45.811 --> 01:04:47.345
Monsters have feelings.

01:04:48.848 --> 01:04:51.283
Yes, why does everybody
keep saying that to me?

01:04:52.684 --> 01:04:55.652
Do you have any
idea what it's like

01:04:55.654 --> 01:04:58.788
to see your friends
and your family

01:04:58.790 --> 01:05:02.360
wither away while you
stay exactly the same?

01:05:03.963 --> 01:05:06.229
Now I don't mind the
not wrinkling part,

01:05:06.231 --> 01:05:10.335
but it does get
very, very lonely.

01:05:12.105 --> 01:05:13.336
Jimmy!

01:05:13.338 --> 01:05:14.471
What about him?

01:05:14.473 --> 01:05:15.505
Why is he?

01:05:15.507 --> 01:05:17.474
Well that was an accident.

01:05:17.476 --> 01:05:18.843
You can blame your
father for that one.

01:05:18.845 --> 01:05:21.511
He lost his temper,
but don't be mad.

01:05:21.513 --> 01:05:22.612
He will need some guidance.

01:05:22.614 --> 01:05:26.986
He's a bit simple that one.

01:05:28.286 --> 01:05:30.787
Okay, I think I understand.

01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:34.457
My father and my boyfriend
are both vampires

01:05:34.459 --> 01:05:36.626
- because of you.
- Yes.

01:05:36.628 --> 01:05:37.995
You've ruined our life you!

01:05:37.997 --> 01:05:43.002
My my, you are indeed
your father's child.

01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:51.608
Well then why don't
you come with me?

01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:52.444
I'll show you.

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:07.793
Whoa, where we are?

01:06:08.961 --> 01:06:12.131
We are in the
monster's hall of fame.

01:06:13.565 --> 01:06:15.900
Is that you?

01:06:15.902 --> 01:06:19.502
No, that is my mother Gloria.

01:06:19.504 --> 01:06:21.306
She was a real pain in the ass.

01:06:22.541 --> 01:06:25.475
Over there, is my
brother Victor.

01:06:25.477 --> 01:06:27.079
He works in Transylvania.

01:06:28.346 --> 01:06:30.346
Why did you bring me here?

01:06:30.348 --> 01:06:32.782
- Well do you see that?
- Yes.

01:06:32.784 --> 01:06:35.418
That is where your
father's painting will go.

01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:38.657
That says Dr. Walker and
my father is Dr. Walenski.

01:06:40.126 --> 01:06:44.929
Well Igor will you
change that plaque already?

01:06:44.931 --> 01:06:47.465
Point is your father
has a calling.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:49.799
What's that?

01:06:49.801 --> 01:06:51.436
Hmm, oh that.

01:06:52.305 --> 01:06:54.771
That is for your Uncle Bob.

01:06:54.773 --> 01:06:56.439
Uncle Bob?

01:06:56.441 --> 01:06:59.143
He found a new set of powers!

01:06:59.145 --> 01:06:59.979
I am Bob!

01:07:01.746 --> 01:07:03.680
And we are still trying
to understand them.

01:07:03.682 --> 01:07:04.616
Let's get you back.

01:07:06.219 --> 01:07:07.584
Will I see you again?

01:07:07.586 --> 01:07:12.390
Of course, we are practically
sisters now.

01:07:20.799 --> 01:07:22.699
Oh God, Raymond
I'm so worried.

01:07:22.701 --> 01:07:24.669
She's been gone 12 hours now.

01:07:29.976 --> 01:07:30.943
What are you doing?

01:07:33.745 --> 01:07:34.579
No!

01:07:35.915 --> 01:07:37.382
No, stop that!

01:07:38.550 --> 01:07:40.752
You and Susie are
better off without me.

01:07:45.224 --> 01:07:48.361
Raymond!

01:07:49.594 --> 01:07:50.760
You know what?

01:07:50.762 --> 01:07:54.430
Fine, go ahead
kill yourself dear.

01:07:54.432 --> 01:07:56.235
I don't care whether
you live or die.

01:08:02.074 --> 01:08:03.007
Why with the hitting?

01:08:03.009 --> 01:08:04.074
That's gonna leave a mark.

01:08:04.076 --> 01:08:04.911
You again?

01:08:05.644 --> 01:08:06.977
You're new here,
okay I get it,

01:08:06.979 --> 01:08:08.645
look I'm here, I'm a regular.

01:08:08.647 --> 01:08:10.446
I'll be here long
after you're gone.

01:08:10.448 --> 01:08:11.681
Okay, I'm here.

01:08:11.683 --> 01:08:13.650
It's Oliver, I'm here
to see Dr. Walenski

01:08:13.652 --> 01:08:15.019
for 9:00 a.m. Tuesday.

01:08:15.021 --> 01:08:16.719
He's in the oven
at the moment.

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.688
I'm the 9:00 a.m.

01:08:18.689 --> 01:08:22.725
I'm the Tuesday 9:00
a.m. Dr. Walenski.

01:08:22.727 --> 01:08:26.263
Raymond you're
nine o'clock's here.

01:08:26.265 --> 01:08:27.099
Damn it!

01:08:28.033 --> 01:08:29.335
Dr. Walenski?

01:08:33.604 --> 01:08:35.772
Oh, there you are
such an honest face.

01:08:35.774 --> 01:08:37.807
I thought about what
you said, not all of it,

01:08:37.809 --> 01:08:41.045
because frankly, you were
projecting and that's normal,

01:08:41.046 --> 01:08:42.046
but I just feel like...

01:08:42.048 --> 01:08:43.546
Yes, can this session
not happen in my kitchen

01:08:43.548 --> 01:08:45.082
unless you want to
chop onions with me,

01:08:45.084 --> 01:08:47.216
I suggest you follow
him into his office.

01:08:47.219 --> 01:08:48.718
Thank you very much.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:49.652
I'm the dark.

01:08:49.654 --> 01:08:52.587
I'm afraid of me, right, right?

01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:55.125
Yeah, that's very true.

01:08:55.127 --> 01:08:56.961
I just need you to say
everything's gonna be okay.

01:08:56.962 --> 01:08:58.493
Right this way Oliver.

01:08:58.496 --> 01:08:59.830
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:08:59.832 --> 01:09:02.166
Can you just say
everything's gonna be okay?

01:09:02.167 --> 01:09:06.036
- This way.
- Okay right this.

01:09:06.037 --> 01:09:08.540
Oh, for goodness sake.

01:09:10.642 --> 01:09:11.877
Dr.
Walenski, Dr. Walenski.

01:09:14.679 --> 01:09:16.511
There's stairs.

01:09:23.288 --> 01:09:24.189
Please sit down.

01:09:28.928 --> 01:09:33.130
I love you both, but I'm very
disappointed in your actions.

01:09:33.131 --> 01:09:35.533
What we did was inexcusable.

01:09:36.568 --> 01:09:37.403
I'm very sorry.

01:09:39.104 --> 01:09:41.205
I hate that you
both lied to me.

01:09:41.207 --> 01:09:45.011
And we are so very,
very sorry aren't we?

01:09:46.678 --> 01:09:50.080
When your father was
bitten, we made a pact

01:09:50.082 --> 01:09:52.416
that we would protect
you no matter what.

01:09:52.417 --> 01:09:54.519
We didn't want you
to be scared darling.

01:09:55.955 --> 01:09:57.289
I'm very sorry about Jimmy.

01:09:58.924 --> 01:09:59.758
It's okay.

01:10:01.027 --> 01:10:02.194
It's understandable.

01:10:03.362 --> 01:10:04.196
Oh.

01:10:06.832 --> 01:10:08.334
You are so grown up.

01:10:09.534 --> 01:10:11.203
We were wrong not
to have told you.

01:10:13.172 --> 01:10:14.407
That's all I wanted to hear.

01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:16.909
Hypermesisangrivadarum?

01:10:19.045 --> 01:10:20.477
Yes well.

01:10:20.479 --> 01:10:21.945
Does Uncle Bob know?

01:10:21.947 --> 01:10:25.151
He brings your father cadaver
blood from the mortuary.

01:10:26.419 --> 01:10:28.152
Now I've come to learn

01:10:28.154 --> 01:10:29.987
that there's a lot
more to this world

01:10:29.989 --> 01:10:31.589
than we could have
ever imagined.

01:10:33.125 --> 01:10:36.293
I was recruited by the Goddess
of the Underworld, Victoria

01:10:36.295 --> 01:10:39.231
to provide counsel to the
creatures of the underworld.

01:10:40.732 --> 01:10:43.235
It turns out monsters have
a lot of emotional issues.

01:10:45.337 --> 01:10:46.138
Goddess?

01:10:47.039 --> 01:10:47.840
Yes dear.

01:10:48.908 --> 01:10:50.074
Is she beautiful?

01:10:50.076 --> 01:10:50.910
I suppose.

01:10:52.511 --> 01:10:54.612
Did she do anything
other than bite you?

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:56.547
Natasha.

01:10:56.549 --> 01:10:58.182
Well what else am
I supposed to think

01:10:58.184 --> 01:11:00.086
when a beautiful goddess
comes for my husband?

01:11:03.721 --> 01:11:08.726
So dad, will you live forever?

01:11:09.328 --> 01:11:09.895
Yes dear.

01:11:11.130 --> 01:11:12.098
Crosses?

01:11:13.165 --> 01:11:13.964
No.

01:11:13.966 --> 01:11:14.834
Holy water?

01:11:15.901 --> 01:11:16.900
Garlic?

01:11:16.902 --> 01:11:18.268
Oh that's a myth.

01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:20.204
I put lots of garlic
in that brisket

01:11:20.206 --> 01:11:22.441
that you like that
you can't eat anymore.

01:11:23.309 --> 01:11:24.709
That brisket was divine.

01:11:25.677 --> 01:11:27.377
Thank you dear.

01:11:27.379 --> 01:11:30.282
Is there anything else you
two would like to tell me?

01:11:31.683 --> 01:11:34.553
Well I have incredibly
heightened sense of hearing.

01:11:36.621 --> 01:11:39.592
Have you heard my private
conversations with Jimmy?

01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:44.361
Oh God, his parents must
be so worried about him.

01:11:44.363 --> 01:11:45.628
Well his parents are dead.

01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:46.499
Oh good.

01:11:49.368 --> 01:11:51.034
I love you both.

01:11:51.036 --> 01:11:53.005
We love you darling.

01:11:58.010 --> 01:11:59.510
Oh.

01:11:59.512 --> 01:12:02.712
Well hey-o, hey-o, what
a beautiful morning indeed.

01:12:02.714 --> 01:12:05.082
Oh well somebody's feeling

01:12:05.084 --> 01:12:08.053
so much better
today aren't they?

01:12:09.522 --> 01:12:10.722
Yes, thank you Bob.

01:12:11.924 --> 01:12:14.825
No really Natasha,
thank you ever so much

01:12:14.827 --> 01:12:17.895
for the most wonderful
cocktail party last night.

01:12:17.897 --> 01:12:22.698
Oh, yes it was rather
special wasn't it dear?

01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:24.168
Yes dear.

01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:25.936
- It really was special.
- It was so special.

01:12:25.938 --> 01:12:27.104
- It really was.
- You're special.

01:12:27.106 --> 01:12:30.073
- You're special.
- Oh I could eat you up.

01:12:30.075 --> 01:12:30.910
Do it.

01:12:33.479 --> 01:12:34.945
Oh Betty can I see your ring?

01:12:34.947 --> 01:12:37.648
Oh my would you look at that?

01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:39.850
- That is...
- Isn't it beautiful?

01:12:39.852 --> 01:12:41.418
Beautiful!

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:42.988
I stole it from a body.

01:12:45.024 --> 01:12:46.691
There was a pretty
bad house fire.

01:12:47.626 --> 01:12:49.193
I love it.

01:12:49.195 --> 01:12:50.194
And I love you.

01:12:50.196 --> 01:12:51.328
I love you.

01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:52.665
Come here you.

01:12:54.533 --> 01:12:56.402
Oh you had a big breakfast.

01:12:58.237 --> 01:13:00.306
You make me so hungry.

01:13:03.142 --> 01:13:04.210
Oh darling.

01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:08.579
Oh.

01:13:08.581 --> 01:13:11.315
I love you, I love you.

01:13:11.317 --> 01:13:12.952
Wait, my back, my back.

01:13:16.622 --> 01:13:17.456
Hi Jimmy.

01:13:19.491 --> 01:13:20.392
Hey Susie.

01:13:23.028 --> 01:13:24.997
I'm sorry I ran away
like that last night.

01:13:26.098 --> 01:13:27.598
It was just all so unexpected.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.401
I guess I got scared.

01:13:30.402 --> 01:13:31.237
I understand.

01:13:32.304 --> 01:13:33.606
So you have fangs now?

01:13:36.741 --> 01:13:37.809
Can I see them?

01:13:52.258 --> 01:13:53.257
I am proud

01:13:53.259 --> 01:13:55.292
to be guiding these lost souls,

01:13:55.294 --> 01:13:57.129
these monsters of
the underworld.

01:13:58.530 --> 01:14:01.064
Group therapy is really
doing wonders for everyone,

01:14:01.066 --> 01:14:03.533
realizing we are
not alone in this.

01:14:03.535 --> 01:14:06.436
The whole vampire thing
hasn't been so bad.

01:14:06.438 --> 01:14:08.407
My daughter finally
thinks I'm cool.

01:14:10.342 --> 01:14:11.910
My wife finds me irresistible.

01:14:12.810 --> 01:14:14.478
And Bob moved out.

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.983
He's just across the street,
but he's not here, so.

01:14:19.118 --> 01:14:20.751
My daughter's teenage
vampire boyfriend

01:14:20.753 --> 01:14:24.690
lives here now and he's like
the son I never had or wanted.

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:30.095
Well it's all
perspective really.

01:14:31.597 --> 01:14:33.997
I will outlive everyone I know.

01:14:33.999 --> 01:14:36.099
I will watch my beautiful
wife and daughter

01:14:36.101 --> 01:14:40.773
age and die in front of me as
I remain like this forever.

01:14:42.274 --> 01:14:44.074
I may have to drink
the blood of a human

01:14:44.076 --> 01:14:45.709
from time to time, but
I never pick anyone

01:14:45.711 --> 01:14:47.644
who doesn't deserve it.

01:14:47.646 --> 01:14:49.513
All in all I have been chosen

01:14:49.515 --> 01:14:52.651
and I am honored to be a
pivotal part of the dark world.

01:14:53.818 --> 01:14:57.921
After all we all have
a little monster in us.

01:15:06.031 --> 01:15:08.999
We hope you enjoyed
our little tale.

01:15:09.001 --> 01:15:11.804

you will love what's to come.
