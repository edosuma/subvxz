00:05.755 --> 00:06.964
- Meg.
- Hi.

00:07.507 --> 00:08.925
Whoa, whoa.

00:09.133 --> 00:10.885
- You were hunting with Jo?
- Yeah.

00:11.093 --> 00:13.971
- The mooks have melted down the gun.
- I hear differently.

00:14.180 --> 00:18.935
And if you are still set on the insane task
of killing the devil, this is how we do it.

00:19.101 --> 00:21.771
<i>In Chapter 33 of Supernatural,
there was that girl Bela.</i>

00:21.938 --> 00:23.272
She stole the Colt from you.

00:23.439 --> 00:25.483
- And she said she gave it to Lilith.
- Yeah.

00:25.691 --> 00:28.152
You know she lied?
She never gave it to Lilith.

00:28.319 --> 00:29.737
- What?
- Bela gives the Colt...

00:29.904 --> 00:32.323
...to a demon named Crowley.
- Crowley?

00:45.461 --> 00:46.712
Oh, jeez.

00:57.723 --> 01:00.393
Mr. Pendleton, I presume.

01:01.018 --> 01:02.103
The name's Crowley.

01:03.563 --> 01:08.568
In my negotiations, I was dealing
with a very young, attractive lady.

01:08.776 --> 01:10.486
Yes, I know.

01:11.028 --> 01:16.868
But you, piggy banker,
you are a big fish.

01:17.034 --> 01:21.038
And I wanted to do you the honor
of sealing this deal personally.

01:21.205 --> 01:23.457
She said
the deal would be sealed with a kiss.

01:23.624 --> 01:25.126
That's right.

01:27.461 --> 01:30.506
- No, I mean, she... I don't...
- Your choice.

01:30.673 --> 01:34.594
You can cling to six decades
of deep-seated homophobia...

01:34.760 --> 01:39.140
...or give it up
and get a complete bailout...

01:39.307 --> 01:41.767
...of your bank's ridiculous
incompetence.

01:43.811 --> 01:45.354
There are just things that I...

01:45.521 --> 01:47.315
- Going once.
- No, I don't think so.

01:47.481 --> 01:49.942
- Going twice.
- All right, all right.

01:52.695 --> 01:53.988
No.

02:05.082 --> 02:06.125
Got him.

02:17.803 --> 02:25.102
The demon Crowley is making a deal.
Even as we speak, it's going down.

02:26.437 --> 02:28.356
Going down?

02:28.523 --> 02:29.982
Right. Okay, Huggy Bear.

02:30.149 --> 02:32.151
<i>- Just don't lose him.
- I won't lose him.</i>

02:32.360 --> 02:34.487
Damn you.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.325
Enjoy the obscene wealth.

02:39.534 --> 02:41.619
See you in 10 years.

02:58.469 --> 02:59.887
I followed him.

03:00.054 --> 03:06.936
It's not far, but it's layered
in Enochian warding magic.

03:09.313 --> 03:10.773
<i>- I can't get in.
- That's okay.</i>

03:10.940 --> 03:12.817
<i>You did great. We'll take it from here.</i>

03:23.035 --> 03:26.289
<i>Everybody plays the fool
Sometimes</i>

03:26.455 --> 03:30.459
<i>There's no exception to the rule</i>

03:30.626 --> 03:32.712
<i>Listen, baby</i>

03:32.879 --> 03:36.299
<i>It may be factual
It may be cruel</i>

03:36.465 --> 03:42.096
<i>I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool</i>

03:49.145 --> 03:51.564
<i>- Yeah?
- Hello? My car broke down.</i>

03:51.731 --> 03:53.482
I need some help.

03:53.649 --> 03:55.818
<i>I'll be down in a minute.</i>

04:11.250 --> 04:12.543
Evening, pretty lady.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.213
Get yourself on in here.

04:15.379 --> 04:17.589
I just need to make a call.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.384
You don't need to call anyone, baby.

04:20.843 --> 04:23.679
We're the only help
you're ever gonna need.

04:23.846 --> 04:27.266
You know what?
I think I should wait by my car.

04:28.893 --> 04:31.896
We said get your ass in here.

04:41.822 --> 04:43.491
- Nice work, Jo.
- Thanks.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.245
Okay, shall we?

04:47.453 --> 04:50.206
<i>Everybody plays the fool</i>

04:50.373 --> 04:51.415
<i>Everybody</i>

04:59.674 --> 05:01.759
It's Crowley, right?

05:01.926 --> 05:05.805
So the Hardy Boys finally found me.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.057
Took you long enough.

05:24.407 --> 05:28.452
Do you have any idea
how much this rug costs?

05:32.081 --> 05:34.167
This is it, right?

05:37.003 --> 05:39.422
This is what it's all about.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.938
We need to talk. Privately.

06:01.235 --> 06:02.612
What the hell is this?

06:02.778 --> 06:05.364
Do you know how deep
I could have buried this thing?

06:05.531 --> 06:10.369
There's no reason you or anyone
should know this even exists at all.

06:10.828 --> 06:13.164
- Except that I told you.
- You told us?

06:13.331 --> 06:16.918
Rumors, innuendo,
sent out on the grapevine.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.628
Why?

06:18.836 --> 06:20.838
Why tell us anything?

06:23.424 --> 06:29.013
I want you to take this thing to Lucifer
and empty it into his face.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.307
Uh-huh.

06:31.933 --> 06:36.020
Okay, and why exactly
would you want the devil dead?

06:36.187 --> 06:40.441
It's called survival.

06:41.275 --> 06:44.570
But I forgot you two, at best,
are functional morons.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.989
Hey, you're functioning morons.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.616
Mor...

06:49.283 --> 06:52.954
Lucifer isn't a demon, remember?
He's an angel.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.582
An angel famous for his hatred
of humankind.

06:56.749 --> 07:00.920
To him, you're just filthy bags of pus.

07:01.128 --> 07:03.422
That's the way he feels about you.

07:04.632 --> 07:06.217
What can he think about us?

07:07.885 --> 07:11.889
- But he created you.
- To him we're just servants.

07:12.056 --> 07:13.516
Cannon fodder.

07:13.724 --> 07:17.520
If Lucifer manages
to exterminate humankind...

07:19.897 --> 07:21.065
...we're next.

07:22.525 --> 07:26.696
So help me, huh?

07:27.238 --> 07:29.657
Let's all go back
to simpler better times.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.618
Back to when we could all follow
our natures.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.829
I'm in sales, damn it.

07:35.621 --> 07:36.789
So, what do you say?

07:36.956 --> 07:43.087
What if I give you this thing,
and you go kill the devil?

07:50.928 --> 07:53.514
- Okay.
- Great.

07:57.185 --> 08:00.688
You wouldn't happen to know where
the devil is, by chance, would you?

08:00.855 --> 08:02.857
Thursday.

08:03.065 --> 08:07.695
Birdies tell me he has an appointment
in Carthage, Missouri.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.824
Great.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.035
Thanks.

08:21.834 --> 08:25.963
Oh, yeah, right, you probably need
some more ammunition.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.760
Excuse me, but aren't you signing
your own death warrant?

08:30.968 --> 08:36.557
I mean, what happens to you
if we go up against the devil and lose?

08:36.724 --> 08:39.101
Number one,
he's gonna wipe us all out anyway.

08:39.268 --> 08:40.770
Two, after you leave here...

08:40.937 --> 08:43.731
...I go on an extended vacation
to all points nowhere.

08:43.898 --> 08:47.652
And three,
how about you don't miss, okay?

08:47.860 --> 08:49.654
Morons!

09:04.210 --> 09:05.628
All right, big boy. Go.

09:19.433 --> 09:22.103
I think I'm starting to feel something.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.981
It's gotta be a trap, right?

09:26.607 --> 09:29.735
Sam Winchester
having trust issues with a demon.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.779
Well, better late than never.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.448
And thank you again
for your continued support.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.117
You're welcome.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.873
You know, trap or no trap...

09:42.039 --> 09:45.084
...if we got a snowball's chance,
we gotta take it, right?

09:46.210 --> 09:48.462
Yeah, I suppose.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.548
Besides, I'm not sure it is a trap.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.008
Check it out.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.635
I mean, Carthage is lit up
like a Christmas tree...

09:54.802 --> 09:56.554
...with Revelation omens.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.848
And look at this.

09:59.056 --> 10:03.394
There's been six missing persons
reported in town since Sunday.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.899
I think the devil's there.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.443
Okay.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.820
But if we think about it...

10:14.113 --> 10:16.282
...you can't come with.
- Dean.

10:16.532 --> 10:19.619
Look, I go against Satan
and screw the pooch.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.287
Okay.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.582
Yeah, we've lost a game piece.
That we can take.

10:24.749 --> 10:29.712
But if you're there, then we are handing
the devil's vessel right over to him.

10:29.879 --> 10:30.922
That's not smart.

10:31.088 --> 10:32.965
When have we ever done
anything smart?

10:33.132 --> 10:35.218
- I'm serious, Sam.
- So am I.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.345
Haven't we learned a damn thing?

10:37.512 --> 10:40.765
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it together.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.484
Okay.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.403
But it's a stupid frigging idea.

10:55.613 --> 10:58.658
Drink up. Stop it. Drink up.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.245
- I'm gonna get another beer.
- Rock and roll.

11:02.411 --> 11:04.455
Boy, talk about stupid ideas.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.666
Good God.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.043
True that.

11:13.798 --> 11:14.841
Mm.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.844
- Hey. Hmm.
- Hey.

11:18.302 --> 11:19.804
So...

11:21.389 --> 11:23.766
...dangerous mission tomorrow.

11:24.642 --> 11:31.524
Guess it's time to eat, drink
and, you know, make merry.

11:32.775 --> 11:35.570
Are you giving me
the last-night-on-earth speech?

11:35.736 --> 11:36.779
- What?
- What?

11:36.988 --> 11:39.448
No. Ha-ha-ha. No.

11:40.199 --> 11:44.203
If I was, would that work?

11:56.424 --> 11:58.009
No.

11:58.176 --> 12:01.888
Sweetheart, if this is our last night
on earth, then I'm going to spend it...

12:02.054 --> 12:04.974
...with a little thing I call self-respect.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.647
- If you're into that kind of thing.
- Everybody, get in here.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.900
It's time for the lineup.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.360
Usual suspects in the corner.

12:16.527 --> 12:19.322
Oh, come on, Bobby,
nobody wants their picture taken.

12:19.488 --> 12:20.531
Hear, hear.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.617
Shut up, you're drinking my beer.

12:24.118 --> 12:29.707
Anyway, I'm gonna need something
to remember your sorry asses by.

12:29.874 --> 12:33.794
Ha! It's always good
to have an optimist around.

12:33.961 --> 12:36.714
Bobby's right.
Tomorrow we hunt the devil.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.092
This is our last night on earth.

13:16.254 --> 13:18.089
Are you getting a signal?

13:18.256 --> 13:20.049
No, nothing.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.426
Nice and spooky.

13:31.769 --> 13:34.480
- Place seem empty to you?
- We're gonna check out the P.D.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.358
- Stay here, see if you can find anybody.
- Okay.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.998
Ever heard of a door handle?

13:52.165 --> 13:54.000
Of course I have.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.631
- What is it, Cass?
- This town's not empty.

14:06.304 --> 14:07.722
Reapers.

14:08.973 --> 14:12.143
Reapers? As in, more than one?

14:13.060 --> 14:15.855
They only gather like this
at times of great catastrophe.

14:16.022 --> 14:20.943
Chicago fire,
San Francisco quake, Pompeii.

14:21.110 --> 14:24.071
Excuse me,
I need to find out why they're here.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.040
Hello, brother.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.588
- Station's empty.
- So is everything else.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.299
- Have you seen Cass?
- What? He was with you.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.844
- Nope, he went after the reapers.
- Reapers?

15:28.010 --> 15:30.012
He saw reapers? Where?

15:30.680 --> 15:32.348
Well, kind of everywhere.

15:51.158 --> 15:52.368
Lucifer.

15:54.871 --> 15:57.206
So I take it
you're here with the Winchesters.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.169
I came alone.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.338
Loyalty.

16:04.505 --> 16:07.842
Hmm. Such a nice quality
to see this day and age.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.262
Castiel, right?

16:14.140 --> 16:18.728
Castiel, I'm told you came here
in an automobile.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.481
Yes.

16:22.690 --> 16:23.774
What was that like?

16:24.692 --> 16:26.110
Um...

16:26.527 --> 16:28.279
Slow.

16:28.738 --> 16:29.822
Confining.

16:30.031 --> 16:32.074
What a peculiar thing you are.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.955
What's wrong with your vessel?

16:38.372 --> 16:43.211
Yes, Nick is wearing a bit thin,
I'm afraid.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.713
He can't contain me forever, so...

16:45.922 --> 16:47.590
You.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.764
You are not taking Sam Winchester.

16:56.766 --> 16:59.060
- I won't let you.
- Castiel.

17:01.020 --> 17:05.316
I don't understand
why you're fighting me, of all the angels.

17:05.483 --> 17:06.733
You really have to ask?

17:07.318 --> 17:08.944
I rebelled. I was cast out.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.821
You rebelled. You were cast out.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.407
Almost all of heaven
wants to see me dead.

17:14.617 --> 17:17.161
And if they succeed, guess what.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.040
You're their new public enemy
number one.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.585
We're on the same side, like it or not.

17:24.752 --> 17:28.089
So why not just serve
your own best interests...

17:28.256 --> 17:30.842
...which, in this case,
just happen to be mine?

17:33.219 --> 17:34.846
I'll die first.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.353
I suppose you will.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.404
Great, we've been in town
for 20 minutes...

17:51.571 --> 17:53.781
...we've already lost the angel
up our sleeve.

17:53.948 --> 17:56.367
You think Lucifer got him?

17:56.534 --> 17:58.077
I don't know what else to think.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.914
There you are.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.168
Meg.

18:06.252 --> 18:10.464
- You shouldn't have come here, boys.
- I could say the same thing for you.

18:11.132 --> 18:13.676
Didn't come here alone, Dino.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.563
- Hellhounds.
- Yeah, Dean, your favorite.

18:26.856 --> 18:29.442
Come on, boys.
My father wants to see you.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.236
- I think we'll pass, thanks.
- Your call.

18:32.737 --> 18:36.157
You can make this easy,
or you can make it really, really hard.

18:41.579 --> 18:44.290
When have you known us
to ever make anything easy?

18:47.460 --> 18:48.878
Run!

18:59.514 --> 19:01.307
- Dean!
- Jo, stay back.

19:09.732 --> 19:11.108
No!

19:26.165 --> 19:28.835
Okay, okay, okay. Hang on.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.628
Breath now.

19:32.964 --> 19:34.715
Boys, need some help here.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.968
Go, go, go.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.882
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.717
Thank you.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.177
Okay, I need you to...

20:19.343 --> 20:21.220
How's she holding up?

20:27.560 --> 20:29.854
- The salt lines are holding up.
- Safe for now.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.399
Yeah, safe or trapped like rats.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.568
Hey, you heard Meg.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.945
Her father's here.

20:38.112 --> 20:41.824
This is our one shot, Sammy.
We gotta take it no matter what.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.623
- Here we go.
- Sam, some help here, please.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.459
<i>The number you have dialed is unavailable.</i>

20:51.626 --> 20:53.753
<i>- Please try...
- Damn it, boys.</i>

21:03.971 --> 21:06.140
<i>KC5 Fox Delta Oscar, come in.</i>

21:06.307 --> 21:09.852
KC5 Fox Delta Oscar, go ahead.

21:10.019 --> 21:13.272
<i>Bobby, it's Dean. We got problems.</i>

21:15.441 --> 21:17.443
It's okay, boy. That's why I'm here.

21:17.652 --> 21:20.154
<i>Is everyone all right?</i>

21:21.155 --> 21:23.699
No, it's...

21:23.866 --> 21:25.785
It's Jo. Bobby, it's pretty bad.

21:29.664 --> 21:31.874
Okay, copy that.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.876
So now we figure what we do next.

21:36.087 --> 21:38.172
Bobby, I don't think she's...

21:43.177 --> 21:46.347
I said, what do we do next, Dean?

21:52.603 --> 21:53.813
Right.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.898
Okay, right.

21:56.107 --> 21:59.402
Now, tell me what you got.

22:01.362 --> 22:04.615
Before he went missing,
did Cass say how many reapers?

22:04.782 --> 22:07.034
I don't know.
He said a lot of things, I guess.

22:07.201 --> 22:10.454
- Does the number matter?
- Devil's in the details, Dean.

22:13.291 --> 22:14.333
Bobby, it's Ellen.

22:14.876 --> 22:17.879
<i>The way he was looking,
number of places Castiel's eyes went...</i>

22:18.045 --> 22:21.716
...I'd say we're talking
over a dozen reapers, probably more.

22:21.883 --> 22:23.342
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

22:24.051 --> 22:25.595
<i>I do not like the sound of that.</i>

22:25.761 --> 22:30.683
Nobody likes the sound of that, Bobby,
but what does that sound like?

22:31.267 --> 22:33.019
It sounds like Death, son.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.938
<i>I think Satan's in town
to work a ritual.</i>

22:37.315 --> 22:40.276
I think he's planning to unleash Death.

22:42.236 --> 22:45.406
You mean, like, as in this dude and taxes
are the only sure thing?

22:45.573 --> 22:49.535
As in Death, the horseman,
the pale rider in the flesh.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.706
Unleash? I mean, hasn't Death
been tromping all over the place?

22:53.873 --> 22:56.501
- I mean, I've died several times myself.
- Not this guy.

22:56.667 --> 23:00.171
This is the Angel of Death,
big daddy reaper.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.257
<i>They keep this guy chained in a box
600 feet under.</i>

23:03.466 --> 23:07.470
Last time they hauled him up,
Noah was building a boat.

23:08.596 --> 23:11.516
That's why the place
is crawling with reapers.

23:11.682 --> 23:14.435
They're waiting on the big boss
to show.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.526
You have any other good news?

23:22.401 --> 23:24.779
Well, in a manner of speaking.

23:24.946 --> 23:28.032
I've been researching Carthage
since you've been gone...

23:28.199 --> 23:30.785
...trying to suss out
what the devil might want there.

23:30.952 --> 23:34.247
<i>What you just said drops the last piece
of the puzzle in place.</i>

23:34.413 --> 23:38.042
The Angel of Death must be brought
into this world at midnight...

23:38.209 --> 23:40.378
...through a place of awful carnage.

23:40.586 --> 23:43.756
Now, back during the Civil War,
there was a battle in Carthage.

23:43.965 --> 23:47.552
A battle so intense, the soldiers called it
the Battle of Hell Hole.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.222
Where'd the massacre go down?

23:51.389 --> 23:54.475
On the land of William Jasper's farm.

24:03.734 --> 24:07.154
I got the Winchesters pinned down.
For now, at least.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.240
What should I do with them?

24:11.117 --> 24:13.119
Leave them alone.

24:13.286 --> 24:15.371
I'm sorry, but are you sure?
Shouldn't we...?

24:15.538 --> 24:17.331
Trust me, child.

24:18.207 --> 24:20.168
Everything happens for a reason.

24:24.964 --> 24:28.384
Well, Castiel, you have some time.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.388
Time to change your mind.

24:36.851 --> 24:38.644
That's my girl. You're okay, honey.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.646
Now we know
where the devil's gonna be.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.441
We know when,
and we have the Colt.

24:43.608 --> 24:47.486
Yeah, we just have to get past
eight or so hellhounds...

24:47.653 --> 24:49.363
...and get to the farm by midnight.

24:49.530 --> 24:53.159
Yeah, and that's after we get
Jo and Ellen the hell out of town.

24:53.951 --> 24:55.578
- Won't be easy.
- Stretcher?

24:56.537 --> 24:58.164
I'll see what we got.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.625
Stop.

25:00.791 --> 25:01.918
Guys, stop.

25:05.505 --> 25:08.132
Can we be realistic about this, please?

25:14.347 --> 25:15.890
Aah.

25:16.057 --> 25:18.476
I can't move my legs.

25:18.643 --> 25:19.810
I can't be moved.

25:20.978 --> 25:24.815
My guts are being held in
by an Ace bandage.

25:25.149 --> 25:26.859
We gotta...

25:27.527 --> 25:30.238
We gotta get
our priorities straight here.

25:33.950 --> 25:36.994
Number one, I'm not going anywhere.

25:37.161 --> 25:39.413
- Joanna Beth, you stop talking like that.
- Mom.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.667
I can't fight.

25:42.834 --> 25:44.877
I can't walk.

25:45.336 --> 25:47.713
But I can do something.

25:48.256 --> 25:53.678
We've got propane, wiring, rock salt,
iron nails, everything we need.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.807
- Everything we need?
- To build a bomb, Sam.

26:00.351 --> 26:02.812
No. Jo, no.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.522
You got another plan?

26:05.731 --> 26:07.483
You got any other plan?

26:09.777 --> 26:11.696
Those are hellhounds out there, Dean.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.661
They've got all of our scents.

26:18.870 --> 26:22.540
Those bitches
will never stop coming after you.

26:28.838 --> 26:31.382
We let the dogs in,
you guys hit the roof...

26:32.175 --> 26:34.218
...make a break
for the building next over.

26:34.385 --> 26:36.596
I can wait here
with my finger on the button.

26:37.513 --> 26:39.849
Rip those mutts a new one.

26:40.016 --> 26:43.477
Or at least get you a few minutes
head start anyway.

26:44.562 --> 26:46.939
No, I won't let you.

26:47.148 --> 26:49.233
This is why we're here, right?

26:50.193 --> 26:52.612
If I can get us a shot on the devil...

26:53.988 --> 26:55.990
Dean, we have to take it.

26:56.199 --> 26:58.075
No.

26:58.826 --> 27:01.037
- That's not...
- Mom.

27:02.371 --> 27:06.667
This might literally be your last chance
to treat me like an adult.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.461
You might wanna take it.

27:29.857 --> 27:31.901
You heard her.

27:32.068 --> 27:33.110
Get to work.

28:23.995 --> 28:25.913
Okay, this is it.

28:28.291 --> 28:30.418
I'll see you on the other side.

28:31.335 --> 28:33.337
Probably sooner than later.

28:37.258 --> 28:39.260
Make it later.

29:21.719 --> 29:23.888
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:49.747 --> 29:50.790
Mom, no.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.959
Somebody's gotta let them in.

29:53.417 --> 29:57.046
And like you said, you're not moving.

29:59.715 --> 30:01.551
You got me, Jo.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.720
And you're right.

30:04.887 --> 30:06.222
This is important.

30:07.890 --> 30:09.892
But I will not leave you here alone.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.481
- Dean.
- Get going now, boys.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.818
- Ellen.
- I said go.

30:23.406 --> 30:25.074
And, Dean.

30:26.367 --> 30:27.577
Kick it in the ass.

30:29.579 --> 30:31.539
Don't miss.

31:15.791 --> 31:18.836
I will always love you, baby.

31:19.003 --> 31:20.087
I...

31:27.678 --> 31:29.138
Honey?

31:31.933 --> 31:33.476
Jo.

31:41.108 --> 31:42.902
It's okay.

31:43.069 --> 31:44.904
It's okay.

31:47.073 --> 31:48.115
That's my good girl.

32:15.893 --> 32:18.688
You can go straight back to hell,
you ugly bitch.

32:47.216 --> 32:50.469
I guess we know what happened
to some of the townspeople.

32:51.888 --> 32:54.140
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:55.308 --> 32:57.185
Last words?

33:04.150 --> 33:05.318
I think I'm good.

33:08.112 --> 33:09.280
Yeah, me too.

33:14.911 --> 33:16.954
Here goes nothing.

33:28.216 --> 33:29.842
Hey!

33:35.014 --> 33:36.807
You wanted to see me?

33:38.559 --> 33:41.479
Well, Sam,
you don't need that gun here.

33:44.398 --> 33:46.734
You know I'd never hurt you.

33:46.901 --> 33:48.152
Not really.

33:50.822 --> 33:52.073
Yeah?

33:52.281 --> 33:53.574
Well, I'd hurt you.

33:55.868 --> 33:56.953
So suck it.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.766
Ow!

34:27.358 --> 34:28.900
Where did you get that?

34:39.161 --> 34:41.956
Now, where were we?

34:49.130 --> 34:51.174
Don't feel too bad, Sam.

34:51.674 --> 34:55.094
There's only five things in all of creation
that that gun can't kill...

34:55.261 --> 34:57.263
...and I just happen
to be one of them.

34:58.014 --> 35:01.017
But if you give me a minute,
I'm almost done.

35:06.439 --> 35:12.487
You know, I don't suppose you'd just
say yes right here and now?

35:13.154 --> 35:16.032
End this whole tiresome discussion.

35:16.824 --> 35:19.869
- That's crazy, right?
- It's never gonna happen.

35:20.036 --> 35:21.621
Oh, I don't know, Sam.

35:21.787 --> 35:22.997
I think it will.

35:24.081 --> 35:25.625
I think it'll happen soon.

35:25.833 --> 35:27.877
Within six months.

35:28.044 --> 35:30.796
And I think it'll happen in Detroit.

35:31.714 --> 35:34.759
You listen to me, you son of a bitch.

35:35.426 --> 35:38.721
I'm gonna kill you myself,
you understand me?

35:39.472 --> 35:41.599
I'm going to rip your heart out.

35:41.766 --> 35:46.020
That's good, Sam.
You keep fanning that fire in your belly.

35:46.229 --> 35:47.855
All that pent-up rage.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.650
I'm gonna need it.

35:54.195 --> 35:55.947
What did you do?

35:56.447 --> 36:00.159
- What did you do to this town?
- I was very generous with this town.

36:00.660 --> 36:03.037
One demon for every able-bodied man.

36:03.246 --> 36:04.705
And the rest of them?

36:08.793 --> 36:10.503
In there.

36:12.213 --> 36:17.635
I know, it's awful,
but these horsemen are so demanding.

36:17.802 --> 36:23.099
So it was women and children first.
Aah.

36:26.936 --> 36:31.816
I know what you must think of me, Sam,
but I have to do this.

36:32.024 --> 36:33.776
I have to.

36:33.943 --> 36:35.945
You, of all people, should understand.

36:38.072 --> 36:39.657
What's that supposed to mean?

36:42.660 --> 36:45.913
I was a son, a brother.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.249
Like you, a younger brother.

36:48.457 --> 36:51.460
And I had an older brother
who I loved.

36:51.627 --> 36:53.421
Idolized, in fact.

36:53.588 --> 36:58.718
And one day, I went to him,
and I begged him to stand with me.

36:59.802 --> 37:01.470
And Michael...

37:03.264 --> 37:05.641
Michael turned on me.

37:06.559 --> 37:07.894
Called me a freak.

37:09.645 --> 37:10.938
A monster.

37:11.147 --> 37:13.608
And then he beat me down...

37:13.774 --> 37:15.860
...all because I was different...

37:16.027 --> 37:18.696
...because I had a mind of my own.

37:20.156 --> 37:21.657
Tell me something, Sam.

37:22.158 --> 37:24.285
Any of this sound familiar?

37:28.789 --> 37:32.168
Anyway, you'll have to excuse me.

37:32.335 --> 37:36.506
Midnight is calling,
and I have a ritual to finish.

37:36.672 --> 37:39.550
Don't go anywhere.
Not that you could if you would.

37:54.524 --> 37:57.068
Now, repeat after me.

37:57.235 --> 38:01.823
- We offer up our lives, blood, souls.
- Uhn.

38:02.031 --> 38:05.743
We offer up lives, blood, souls.

38:05.910 --> 38:08.204
To complete this tribute.

38:08.412 --> 38:11.040
To complete this tribute.

38:25.388 --> 38:26.889
What?

38:31.602 --> 38:33.938
They're just demons.

38:43.948 --> 38:45.199
You seem pleased.

38:46.868 --> 38:48.786
We're gonna win.

38:48.953 --> 38:50.371
Can you feel it?

38:52.790 --> 38:57.170
You cloud-hopping pansies
lost the whole damn universe.

38:57.336 --> 39:00.047
Lucifer's gonna take over heaven.

39:00.256 --> 39:02.425
We're going to heaven, Clarence. Heh.

39:04.010 --> 39:05.428
Strange.

39:05.595 --> 39:08.806
Because I heard a different theory
from a demon named Crowley.

39:10.266 --> 39:11.601
You don't know Crowley.

39:11.767 --> 39:17.190
He believes Lucifer
is just using demons to achieve an end.

39:17.356 --> 39:23.446
And that once he does,
he'll destroy you all.

39:24.238 --> 39:25.448
You're wrong.

39:25.656 --> 39:28.075
Lucifer is the father of our race.

39:28.284 --> 39:29.660
Our creator.

39:30.536 --> 39:33.915
Your God may be a deadbeat,
but mine...

39:34.081 --> 39:35.333
Mine walks the earth.

39:48.262 --> 39:50.848
You can't gank demons, can you?

39:51.432 --> 39:55.561
You're cut off from the home office,
and you ain't got the juice.

39:56.270 --> 39:59.315
So, what can you do,
you impotent sap?

40:01.484 --> 40:03.736
I can do this.

40:41.107 --> 40:44.902
Oh, hello, Death.

40:50.074 --> 40:53.244
<i>We just received an
update that the governor has declared...</i>

40:53.411 --> 40:55.496
<i>...a state of emergency
for Paulding County...</i>

40:55.663 --> 40:59.208
<i>...including the towns of Marion,
Fetterville and Carthage.</i>

40:59.375 --> 41:01.544
