WEBVTT

00:00.750 --> 00:03.300
Do not try what you're about to see at home.

00:03.460 --> 00:05.640
We're what you call experts.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.920
On this gripping episode of Mythbusters...

00:11.140 --> 00:12.960
Adam and Jamie spin out...

00:13.050 --> 00:14.590
I can feel the breeze.

00:14.590 --> 00:17.520
in a double bill about dangerous driving.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.330
Freaking hell, that's hilarious!

00:19.330 --> 00:21.780
First, is it true that some types of shoe...

00:21.780 --> 00:23.440
Seriously, stop laughing!

00:23.920 --> 00:26.330
make you worse behind the wheel.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.780
Then, Adam's bladder is under pressure...

00:28.780 --> 00:29.750
Okay, I can't even tell you

00:29.750 --> 00:31.200
how badly I have to pee right now.

00:31.200 --> 00:34.190
as the guys test if being about to burst

00:34.410 --> 00:36.360
is as bad as being boozed-up.

00:36.360 --> 00:37.790
That was bad, @#$%…….

00:38.760 --> 00:41.890
Meanwhile, Tory, Kari and Grant are stuck,

00:42.130 --> 00:45.420
tackling two tall tales about super adhesive.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.080
This glue is incredible!

00:47.080 --> 00:48.800
Can the superb glue

00:48.800 --> 00:51.330
really turn a room upside down?

00:51.330 --> 00:52.970
We'll be like rock stars!

00:52.970 --> 00:55.480
And then, in a full-on head-on crash...

00:55.480 --> 00:56.390
That is a headache!

00:56.390 --> 00:58.510
Could this ultimate sticky stuff

00:58.510 --> 01:01.740
really stand in for our seat belt?

01:04.709 --> 01:06.820
Who are the mythbusters?

01:07.550 --> 01:08.710
Adam Savage...

01:08.710 --> 01:09.810
I got the chicken!

01:10.530 --> 01:12.030
and Jamie Hyneman.

01:14.320 --> 01:18.600
Between them, more than 30 years of special-effects experience.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.110
Together with Grant Imahara...

01:21.110 --> 01:22.000
Save yourselves!

01:22.000 --> 01:23.360
Kari Byron...

01:23.470 --> 01:24.480
That was awesome!

01:24.480 --> 01:26.130
and Tory Belleci.

01:26.350 --> 01:27.980
We're gonna die!

01:27.980 --> 01:29.960
They don't just tell the myths,

01:30.540 --> 01:32.960
they put them to the test.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.060
At first, buckle up,

01:41.060 --> 01:43.760
cause the mythbusters are going to hit the road.

01:48.820 --> 01:49.970
That sounds like fun.

01:49.970 --> 01:51.080
What's the first one?

01:51.250 --> 01:52.410
I'll give you a hint.

01:53.310 --> 01:54.530
How does that fit in?

01:54.920 --> 01:57.430
Well, the myth is that there are certain types of shoewear

01:57.430 --> 01:59.990
so poorly designed for driving that

01:59.990 --> 02:03.110
they make you into a dangerous driver.

02:03.770 --> 02:05.960
You don't actually think I'm going to wear those, do you?

02:05.960 --> 02:07.550
In fact, I do.

02:09.440 --> 02:10.600
I thought you would respond that way,

02:10.600 --> 02:12.320
but I got something that will make you feel better.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.050
- What's that? - Our second story,

02:14.050 --> 02:16.810
which is that driving with an extremely full bladder

02:16.810 --> 02:20.670
is supposed to be just as bad as driving while drunk.

02:20.890 --> 02:22.490
And how's that gonna make me feel better?

02:22.490 --> 02:24.750
Because I am gonna be the test subject.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.660
Okay, that does actually make me feel better.

02:27.660 --> 02:28.730
I thought it might.

02:29.190 --> 02:31.880
So, it is a duo of driving myths.

02:32.660 --> 02:34.200
Could it really be possible that

02:34.200 --> 02:37.290
driving under the influence of a full bladder

02:37.290 --> 02:40.480
is just as bad as driving when you're drunk?

02:40.860 --> 02:41.800
But first up,

02:41.800 --> 02:44.810
could it be true that certain types of footwear

02:44.810 --> 02:47.540
will turn you into a hazard on the highway?

02:48.710 --> 02:50.940
Well, supposing you do actually manage

02:50.940 --> 02:52.200
to get me in a pair of those,

02:52.200 --> 02:53.910
how do you propose we test them.

02:53.990 --> 02:55.070
Why don't we do it like this,

02:55.070 --> 02:56.830
we each wear a strange piece of footwear

02:56.830 --> 02:59.270
with our foot all the way down on the accelerator.

02:59.270 --> 03:01.000
Then we time how long it takes

03:01.000 --> 03:03.360
to get from the accelerator all the way to the brake.

03:03.540 --> 03:05.440
We pick the three worst shoes and test those

03:05.440 --> 03:08.050
on a closed course under extreme conditions.

03:08.050 --> 03:09.000
That works.

03:09.880 --> 03:11.910
So the guys will put their best foot forward

03:11.910 --> 03:13.520
with six shoe types

03:13.520 --> 03:16.000
that already look dodgy to drive in.

03:16.580 --> 03:18.260
Flip flops, high heels,

03:18.260 --> 03:19.740
wedges, platform shoes,

03:19.740 --> 03:21.670
elevator boots, and snow boots.

03:21.670 --> 03:23.070
We're gonna choose the three worst,

03:23.070 --> 03:24.890
the three that will affect your driving the most,

03:24.890 --> 03:26.930
and we're gonna do that in small scale here in the shop

03:27.030 --> 03:28.820
by putting on each pair of shoes,

03:28.930 --> 03:30.840
and getting in the car while it's stationary,

03:30.840 --> 03:33.670
and timing how long it takes us to move the foot

03:33.670 --> 03:35.390
from all the way down on the accelerator

03:35.390 --> 03:37.260
to all the way down on the brake.

03:37.570 --> 03:38.690
The idea is that

03:38.690 --> 03:41.560
the more a shoe slows a driver's response time,

03:42.480 --> 03:44.740
the worse a driver that person will be.

03:44.740 --> 03:45.330
All right!

03:45.330 --> 03:48.100
So the guys are waiting for some reaction time tests.

03:48.420 --> 03:49.080
Cool.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.460
Here is how it's gonna work.

03:50.820 --> 03:53.060
When that sign turns from green to red,

03:53.060 --> 03:54.070
a timer starts.

03:54.430 --> 03:55.760
I'll be sitting in the car

03:55.760 --> 03:57.570
with my foot on the accelerator pedal.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.020
The moment I see that timer start,

03:59.020 --> 04:01.590
my goal is as fast as possible to get my foot

04:01.590 --> 04:03.850
off the accelerator and onto the brake

04:03.850 --> 04:05.210
which stops the timer.

04:05.330 --> 04:06.940
And that's our reaction time.

04:07.090 --> 04:07.820
Indeed.

04:07.820 --> 04:11.120
And the three pairs that cause the slowest reaction times

04:11.130 --> 04:13.660
will make it through to the real world road test.

04:13.660 --> 04:14.460
What's first?

04:14.460 --> 04:16.209
Flip flops. I like flip flops.

04:16.209 --> 04:19.450
Well, there's entire states where people wear these 24/7

04:19.450 --> 04:21.070
like Florida and Hawaii.

04:21.230 --> 04:23.320
Who knows how dangerous it is to drive there?

04:23.320 --> 04:24.680
As their name suggests,

04:24.680 --> 04:27.460
flip flops are hardly precision footwear

04:27.460 --> 04:29.100
which Adam discovers.

04:29.980 --> 04:31.290
0.71.

04:31.570 --> 04:34.090
To eliminate any little performance glitches,

04:34.090 --> 04:36.950
the guys will both test each pair of shoes.

04:37.400 --> 04:40.350
0.55, the gentleman is fast.

04:40.350 --> 04:41.920
Then, average their results,

04:41.920 --> 04:44.680
to sort the shoes in reaction time order.

04:44.690 --> 04:45.790
High heels.

04:46.890 --> 04:47.590
They may hurt.

04:47.590 --> 04:49.770
But nothing makes my calves look better.

04:49.770 --> 04:52.670
They have chosen footwear from every walk of life...

04:53.760 --> 04:55.020
1.28.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.150
whether it's high style heels...

04:58.110 --> 05:01.150
I think production came up with a story

05:01.730 --> 05:05.640
just so they can see me in these shoes.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.570
extreme elevations...

05:08.130 --> 05:10.140
I feel like I'm able to actually walk

05:10.140 --> 05:11.820
a lot faster in them.

05:12.360 --> 05:13.600
It's probably an illusion.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.340
I can feel the breeze.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.920
even the Arctic circle.

05:19.030 --> 05:20.350
All right, bunny boots.

05:20.350 --> 05:21.430
Ready when you are.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.180
I got my foot stuck behind the brake.

05:27.180 --> 05:28.970
And after a full day of testing...

05:28.970 --> 05:31.290
0.51. Nice.

05:31.310 --> 05:34.210
the mythbusters have all the reaction time data...

05:34.600 --> 05:37.050
0.53. He is in the zone!

05:37.110 --> 05:39.100
and embarrassing flashbacks...

05:39.100 --> 05:41.080
Those are fabulous.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.420
they could ever need.

05:42.420 --> 05:43.640
0.54.

05:45.600 --> 05:46.640
What have we got?

05:46.700 --> 05:49.050
Well, it is actually really close,

05:49.050 --> 05:51.910
the three worst ones were snow boots,

05:52.060 --> 05:54.600
high heels, and wedges.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.950
Those are the three we're gonna be testing on the road.

05:57.160 --> 05:58.280
I'll be darned.

05:59.080 --> 06:02.080
High heels, wedges, and bunny boots.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.700
The values that we got from these boots

06:03.700 --> 06:05.070
are quite close to each other.

06:05.070 --> 06:08.050
But this was a controlled test in the shop.

06:08.050 --> 06:08.800
Out of the field

06:08.800 --> 06:10.890
when we're doing sophisticated driving maneuvers,

06:10.890 --> 06:13.270
the difference might be much greater.

06:13.930 --> 06:16.400
I would put my money on the bunny boots

06:16.480 --> 06:19.310
as giving us the most amount of trouble on the road.

06:23.190 --> 06:25.330
Coming up, Kari, Tory and Grant

06:25.330 --> 06:27.970
have themselves a sticky situation.

06:29.600 --> 06:32.160
Now, ever since we started testing duct tape myths

06:32.160 --> 06:33.910
and doing all things duct tape,

06:33.910 --> 06:36.410
all the fans want us to test another substance.

06:36.410 --> 06:37.980
You mean super adhesive.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.670
Exactly. They think it's so amazing

06:39.670 --> 06:41.380
that it can do all these crazy things.

06:41.380 --> 06:42.650
All right, so, like what?

06:42.650 --> 06:43.930
Super adhesive seat belt,

06:44.200 --> 06:46.590
and the old classic, upside down room.

06:46.590 --> 06:48.890
Dude, sounds like it could get messy.

06:51.110 --> 06:53.190
Super adhesive is the perfect glue

06:53.190 --> 06:55.850
when you're hanging out for a quick fix.

06:56.390 --> 07:00.580
But can super adhesive really let you turn a room upside down

07:00.820 --> 07:03.190
or stick you safely to your seat

07:03.190 --> 07:04.900
if you have a car crash?

07:06.130 --> 07:07.220
You know, these all sound great,

07:07.220 --> 07:09.230
but first, I'd like to know what we are up against.

07:09.230 --> 07:11.420
Yeah, the fans got some pretty outlandish claims.

07:11.420 --> 07:12.230
Before we dive in,

07:12.230 --> 07:13.170
I'd like to do some tests,

07:13.170 --> 07:15.080
see, like how much mass can it carry.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.360
All right, sounds good to me.

07:16.430 --> 07:17.860
With science on the menu,

07:17.860 --> 07:19.490
Tory muscles together a rig

07:19.490 --> 07:22.940
designed to see how strong the super adhesive really is.

07:22.940 --> 07:24.730
So, I built this oversized barbell

07:24.730 --> 07:26.830
that can take up to a thousand pounds

07:26.830 --> 07:28.620
that we can lift with our forklift.

07:28.780 --> 07:30.450
It is a heavy duty rig,

07:30.450 --> 07:32.590
especially when you hear what it is up against.

07:32.590 --> 07:35.800
All right, so this first test is just one drop, right?

07:35.830 --> 07:38.750
One tiny little drop.

07:39.520 --> 07:40.800
Somehow I thought it would be a bigger drop.

07:40.800 --> 07:41.690
Yeah.

07:41.690 --> 07:44.160
Yep, it's just a single drop of glue.

07:44.210 --> 07:46.840
But will that be enough to raise the bar?

07:47.160 --> 07:49.290
All right, I know the super glue is strong.

07:49.330 --> 07:51.540
And these are near ideal surfaces.

07:51.540 --> 07:53.410
But we're talking about one drop.

07:53.410 --> 07:57.160
My guess, 250, maybe 275 pounds.

07:57.170 --> 07:58.100
To find out,

07:58.100 --> 08:01.000
they'll add weights to the bar until the glue gives out.

08:01.020 --> 08:02.170
The question is,

08:02.170 --> 08:04.680
how many pounds till it grounds?

08:04.960 --> 08:06.750
All right, 100 pounds.

08:08.670 --> 08:11.780
- Yes, 100 pounds. - Looks like it holds.

08:11.780 --> 08:13.620
It's so far so good,

08:13.690 --> 08:15.160
and two lifts later...

08:15.390 --> 08:16.760
200 pounds. Do it.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.210
- No problem. - Nice.

08:19.210 --> 08:21.330
It could have Grant's prediction covered.

08:21.330 --> 08:23.680
Okay, this is 300 pounds.

08:25.700 --> 08:26.780
Nice.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.570
That's pretty surprising.

08:28.570 --> 08:31.890
One drop of glue, 300 pounds.

08:31.890 --> 08:33.419
But the test ain't over...

08:33.890 --> 08:36.179
You got any more in you? You could do it.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.570
until the drop drops off.

08:38.570 --> 08:42.460
- 650. Let's do it. - Do it!

08:43.510 --> 08:45.120
- I can't even believe it. - No problem.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.310
- I can't even believe it. - 650!

08:46.610 --> 08:48.050
How much further can it go?

08:48.050 --> 08:50.460
I don't know, let's see if we can go up to a thousand.

08:50.460 --> 08:51.490
Oh my God.

08:55.780 --> 08:59.820
So then, it's 650 pounds is the strength of one drop.

08:59.820 --> 09:02.870
Seven drops should be enough to lift

09:02.870 --> 09:05.000
the weight of your average American car,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.960
which is about 4,000 pounds or two tons.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.450
We're gonna see if that works.

09:09.510 --> 09:12.210
I have so much faith in this glue.

09:12.210 --> 09:13.570
I really do think this car

09:13.570 --> 09:16.890
is gonna go up off the ground with seven drops.

09:17.900 --> 09:20.220
Six, seven.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.330
All right, seven drops of glue.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.390
Kari climbs into the hot seat and it is go time.

09:26.390 --> 09:27.500
All right, Kari.

09:32.390 --> 09:34.130
- Holding. - Yes!

09:36.580 --> 09:39.210
It works! It's off the ground.

09:39.210 --> 09:40.960
No way!

09:40.980 --> 09:44.900
Seven drops is enough to lift a car.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.520
That is insane!

09:47.710 --> 09:49.830
Oh my God. We lifted a car with glue!

09:54.420 --> 09:55.180
This is amazing.

09:55.180 --> 09:57.400
We lifted a car with seven drops of glue.

09:57.400 --> 09:58.820
Now, I knew this stuff was strong,

09:58.820 --> 10:00.390
but I didn't know it was this strong.

10:00.450 --> 10:01.330
But this is Mythbusters,

10:01.330 --> 10:02.450
we're not gonna stop here.

10:02.450 --> 10:04.220
We have a whole bunch of tests just to find out

10:04.220 --> 10:05.980
how well this glue works.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.570
Isn't that the truth, with upside down rooms

10:09.570 --> 10:11.490
and seat belt stand-ins,

10:11.490 --> 10:13.770
there's a lot more to come on stunned.

10:14.090 --> 10:16.700
I never glued a bed to the roof before.

10:24.060 --> 10:27.730
For some years, the headlines have had it in for high heels.

10:27.730 --> 10:31.640
But does fancy footwear really lead to dodgy driving?

10:32.290 --> 10:34.670
Well, in the shop, Adam and Jamie's

10:34.670 --> 10:37.050
health hazard heels were just that.

10:37.400 --> 10:38.550
But now it is time to see

10:38.550 --> 10:40.910
if there will be a risk on the road.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.890
So we got a closed course and a car

10:43.890 --> 10:45.660
with racing harnesses in it.

10:45.870 --> 10:47.550
What could be a better day?

10:48.180 --> 10:50.040
And they'll super charge the testing

10:50.040 --> 10:52.700
with a stunt driving shoe show down.

10:52.850 --> 10:55.080
We brought out an old friend, Mark Ralph,

10:55.080 --> 10:59.100
who is an instructor at the Alameda county EVOC training center.

11:00.190 --> 11:01.370
Jamie and I are gonna line up

11:01.370 --> 11:03.640
a bunch of complicated driving maneuvers.

11:03.640 --> 11:06.520
Just remember, let the car do the work.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.410
We can get really good at them.

11:09.610 --> 11:10.410
And now.

11:11.710 --> 11:12.310
That was nice.

11:12.310 --> 11:13.150
And then we're going to see

11:13.150 --> 11:15.410
if it's even remotely possible to do them

11:15.410 --> 11:16.870
in some fancy footwear.

11:22.170 --> 11:24.700
That is so much fun!

11:25.450 --> 11:27.240
And there's more fun to come,

11:27.240 --> 11:29.450
because those silky stunt skills

11:29.450 --> 11:33.050
are gonna be the basis for our fancy footwear test track.

11:33.430 --> 11:34.530
That's the end of the straight way.

11:34.530 --> 11:37.580
And to say it's extreme is an understatement.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.830
The first part of the course is accident avoidance.

11:40.830 --> 11:41.940
The moment the light changes,

11:41.940 --> 11:43.590
Jamie has to choose a lane.

11:43.990 --> 11:45.950
Accident avoidance means not hitting any cones,

11:45.950 --> 11:48.010
it also means not hitting any people.

11:48.010 --> 11:49.390
After the accident avoidance

11:49.390 --> 11:51.250
comes the forward 180

11:51.250 --> 11:52.730
which we have been practicing.

11:55.180 --> 11:56.910
He's gotten pretty good at it, too.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.160
He's got a nudge this pedestrian.

12:01.300 --> 12:03.630
Then he goes into a reverse 180.

12:05.170 --> 12:06.290
Like that.

12:06.290 --> 12:07.990
The reverse 180 leads naturally

12:07.990 --> 12:09.950
to a zig zag slalom which requires

12:09.950 --> 12:14.460
very precise application at both the gas and the brake,

12:14.460 --> 12:17.750
so that might be very difficult with weird shoes.

12:22.710 --> 12:24.350
And the whole thing gets timed.

12:24.350 --> 12:27.120
So try and get the best possible time.

12:27.170 --> 12:29.390
Yep, a time trial is the ideal way

12:29.390 --> 12:31.660
to put the shoes through their paces.

12:31.660 --> 12:33.330
And first up is the control.

12:33.330 --> 12:35.260
The regular shoes benchmark.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.990
Regular shoes, control test,

12:37.990 --> 12:40.750
in 3, 2, 1. Go.

12:42.980 --> 12:44.400
First one is working out great.

12:45.290 --> 12:46.170
To make it through quickly,

12:46.170 --> 12:48.800
you have to move your foot from pedal to pedal back and forth,

12:48.800 --> 12:50.360
back and forth, back and forth.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.540
It is working fine with the shoes that I've got on.

12:52.540 --> 12:55.360
But, what it does with fancy footwear,

12:55.510 --> 12:56.470
we'll see.

12:56.540 --> 12:58.450
All right, well, your first one was 1'22,

12:58.450 --> 12:59.660
second was 1'21.

12:59.660 --> 13:01.040
I think that's your benchmark.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.400
- Okay. - My turn.

13:04.420 --> 13:07.300
3, 2, 1, go.

13:12.180 --> 13:13.590
If any kind of alternative shoe

13:13.590 --> 13:16.020
that was going to inhibit my ability to drive at all,

13:16.020 --> 13:18.010
it's going to show up on this course.

13:19.010 --> 13:20.010
How did I do?

13:20.090 --> 13:21.350
1'17.

13:21.350 --> 13:23.230
1'17. I've been hitting that every time.

13:23.230 --> 13:24.760
I guess that's my benchmark.

13:25.790 --> 13:27.560
That's pure fun right there.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.900
They burn through their control laps in times

13:29.900 --> 13:33.300
that the hazardous heels might find hard to match.

13:38.230 --> 13:41.150
Super adhesive had set a really high standard.

13:41.410 --> 13:43.040
It's off the ground.

13:43.040 --> 13:45.280
We lifted the car with nothing but glue.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.760
But could it fail at the first myth?

13:48.870 --> 13:49.930
All right. So now that we have seen

13:49.930 --> 13:51.680
the power of super adhesive,

13:51.680 --> 13:52.700
what's the first myth?

13:52.700 --> 13:54.410
All right, this myth comes from the '70s.

13:54.410 --> 13:57.160
Apparently rock bands would go to hotels,

13:57.180 --> 13:58.120
and pull these pranks.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.140
And one of the pranks

13:59.140 --> 14:01.530
is that they would glue the furniture from the room

14:01.560 --> 14:02.570
on the ceiling.

14:02.680 --> 14:04.530
Okay. The crazy part of this to me

14:04.530 --> 14:07.380
is not just the logistics, but time restraints.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.220
They would have had to do it, like overnight.

14:09.220 --> 14:11.180
We should not only glue our furniture up,

14:11.180 --> 14:12.890
we should do it within a day.

14:13.090 --> 14:14.790
All right, let's get to it.

14:16.760 --> 14:20.110
Rock stars have a history of hotel room hi-jinxs.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.370
But can you really turn a room

14:22.370 --> 14:25.000
upside down with super adhesive?

14:26.510 --> 14:29.190
So this is the room that we're gonna turn upside down.

14:29.190 --> 14:30.240
Now, it is built to code,

14:30.240 --> 14:33.390
and has everything you would find in a hotel room.

14:33.390 --> 14:34.940
We have a desk with a computer on it,

14:34.940 --> 14:37.290
we got a light stand, we got a bed with sheets,

14:37.290 --> 14:38.510
that ain't going to be easy.

14:38.670 --> 14:41.240
We have a coffee table with a whole bunch of stuff on that.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.430
We have a couch,

14:42.430 --> 14:45.270
there's a plant, there's a television.

14:45.450 --> 14:46.430
There's some dirty laundry.

14:46.430 --> 14:47.980
I mean, this is one of our rooms.

14:49.670 --> 14:52.370
Although none of these items weighs as much as a car,

14:52.370 --> 14:55.200
what's critical is the materials they're made from.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.610
These lumpy, absorbent surfaces

14:57.610 --> 15:00.110
are a super adhesive's kryptonite.

15:00.110 --> 15:01.870
It would be difficult to get them to stick to the floor,

15:01.870 --> 15:03.050
let alone the ceiling.

15:03.050 --> 15:04.620
And we don't have that much time.

15:04.620 --> 15:05.530
But my guess,

15:05.530 --> 15:08.140
the most difficult thing to stick to the ceiling...

15:10.320 --> 15:11.330
the bed.

15:11.790 --> 15:13.510
With the check-out clock ticking,

15:14.510 --> 15:16.710
Tory needs to first stick the bed,

15:16.710 --> 15:19.220
not to the ceiling, but to itself.

15:19.650 --> 15:22.530
What I'm trying to do is get as much glue

15:22.770 --> 15:24.440
on the mattress as possible.

15:24.720 --> 15:27.550
And even then, I don't know how well it's gonna stick.

15:27.550 --> 15:29.860
Seven drops was enough to lift a car.

15:29.910 --> 15:31.680
But it's taken seven bottles

15:31.680 --> 15:33.830
to stick the mattress to the base.

15:33.850 --> 15:36.140
But eventually, it's set for liftoff.

15:36.140 --> 15:37.850
All right, so this tool is normally used

15:37.850 --> 15:39.780
to lift sheetrock up to the ceiling.

15:40.300 --> 15:42.020
And we're gonna to be using it to lift furnitures

15:42.020 --> 15:43.240
so that we can glue it to the ceiling.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.030
I bet it was never intended for that.

15:45.830 --> 15:47.390
It's a delicate balance...

15:48.030 --> 15:49.880
There's something you don't see every day.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.490
between letting the glue harden...

15:51.490 --> 15:54.720
I never glued a bed to the roof before.

15:55.230 --> 15:57.180
and staying on top of the clock.

15:57.980 --> 15:59.610
This is sticky!

15:59.720 --> 16:00.680
Get it wrong...

16:00.680 --> 16:02.800
All right, let's see if the glue holds the bed up.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.640
and this myth will come crashing to earth.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.440
That's pretty solid so far.

16:11.390 --> 16:12.740
That is awesome.

16:12.740 --> 16:13.770
It's holding.

16:13.770 --> 16:16.400
That is one upside down bed,

16:16.400 --> 16:18.900
with a cherry on top.

16:20.200 --> 16:21.570
But there's no let up,

16:21.570 --> 16:23.710
because the couch is next to go.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.940
And thanks to its nice, flat feet...

16:27.140 --> 16:29.090
I think we may have pulled it off.

16:29.310 --> 16:31.370
the glue is now two for two.

16:31.510 --> 16:33.140
All right, go, go, go.

16:33.830 --> 16:35.080
This corner is holding.

16:35.080 --> 16:37.870
It is a "don't try this at home" classic.

16:37.870 --> 16:38.570
Nice.

16:38.570 --> 16:40.020
Next piece of furniture.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.700
So you look at the TV, and you think no problem.

16:42.700 --> 16:44.330
It's got a huge flat base,

16:44.330 --> 16:46.180
probably got about a hundred square inches

16:46.180 --> 16:48.130
of surface area to glue to, right?

16:48.460 --> 16:50.770
Wrong, this is gonna be a nightmare.

16:50.770 --> 16:54.380
See, underneath the TV is as whole waffle pattern.

16:54.450 --> 16:55.540
Double that with the fact

16:55.540 --> 16:58.750
that this is an old school, heavy, tube type TV,

16:59.200 --> 17:01.260
and you got a problem.

17:01.660 --> 17:04.599
A problem that's gonna swallow serious time.

17:04.740 --> 17:06.890
But they can't afford down tools,

17:06.890 --> 17:08.760
so up goes the coffee table.

17:08.849 --> 17:10.550
My hands are burning.

17:10.839 --> 17:15.089
And 40 minutes later, the TV is set.

17:19.109 --> 17:21.599
But eventually, with all hands on deck,

17:22.020 --> 17:24.290
the glue triumphs again.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.700
It's like magic!

17:30.650 --> 17:32.890
Now, with no time to hang around,

17:32.890 --> 17:35.690
up goes the desk, complete with accessories...

17:35.700 --> 17:38.800
Of course it's a hell, we are talking about 70s' lamps.

17:38.820 --> 17:40.460
and the shag carpet.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.800
It's awesome.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.660
Just as they are wondering what all of the fuss was about...

17:45.730 --> 17:47.490
Mother scratcher.

17:48.210 --> 17:49.580
they get stuck.

17:50.220 --> 17:51.660
Now, the potted plant is one of

17:51.660 --> 17:53.440
the lightest things in this challenge.

17:53.440 --> 17:57.290
But the soft wicker basket just doesn't want to stick.

17:57.880 --> 18:01.290
So, plan is, keep adding glue until it does.

18:01.290 --> 18:03.220
- How's that? - That's pretty.

18:03.220 --> 18:04.790
One bottle becomes two.

18:05.220 --> 18:06.740
Two becomes three.

18:07.570 --> 18:09.130
But after an hour's work,

18:10.190 --> 18:12.520
they finally stick it to the plant.

18:14.390 --> 18:17.490
And there's still time for a few final flourishes,

18:20.630 --> 18:24.040
before the result floors them.

18:25.580 --> 18:27.500
This is so psychedelic.

18:27.500 --> 18:28.770
Isn't this crazy?

18:28.900 --> 18:31.830
Well, looks like you can turn a room upside down with glue.

18:31.940 --> 18:33.940
And I think this is confirmed.

18:33.940 --> 18:37.150
Confirmed, but very, very strange.

18:41.170 --> 18:44.750
Later, will super adhesive hang on in a head on?

18:44.750 --> 18:45.900
Here we go!

18:48.550 --> 18:49.560
But next,

18:49.970 --> 18:53.270
it's the ultimate hot rubber high heel ho-down.

19:01.250 --> 19:03.940
We have been testing the myth that certain types of footwear

19:03.940 --> 19:07.670
can inhibit driving to the point where they make it dangerous.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.590
We have done some controls,

19:10.590 --> 19:12.480
and we selected the three types of footwear

19:12.480 --> 19:15.950
we considered most likely to cause that difficulty.

19:15.950 --> 19:18.080
And now it's time to put this story to the test.

19:18.530 --> 19:21.260
That's why we're wearing our driving shoes.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.000
This is just wrong.

19:26.020 --> 19:28.660
Seriously, this could be dangerous, so stop laughing.

19:29.290 --> 19:30.520
Seriously, stop laughing.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.150
- Yeah. - Shall we?

19:32.150 --> 19:33.130
- Yeah. - All right.

19:33.130 --> 19:35.810
These red heels were the third slowest performers

19:35.810 --> 19:37.670
in the reaction time tests.

19:37.670 --> 19:38.670
I'm great!

19:39.380 --> 19:41.500
Humans weren't meant to wear these things.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.920
But when the rubber hits the road,

19:43.920 --> 19:47.670
how will these shoes affect Adam's 1'17 benchmark.

19:48.130 --> 19:52.570
Okay, red shoes in 3, 2, 1, go.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.560
Unfortunately for Adam,

19:54.560 --> 19:57.000
there seems to be trouble from the very start.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.260
Harder to get up to speak because I am pointing my toes.

19:59.260 --> 20:00.940
Because of the narrow toe...

20:03.510 --> 20:04.890
Okay, that was different.

20:05.040 --> 20:06.730
and the towering heel.

20:06.730 --> 20:10.690
Then to the reverse 180, ladies and gentlemen.

20:11.310 --> 20:14.380
Shifting from pedal to pedal seems harder.

20:14.900 --> 20:16.750
A little understeer.

20:16.830 --> 20:19.890
Could Adam and his stilettos do stay the distance?

20:19.890 --> 20:20.910
Come on, baby.

20:20.990 --> 20:22.260
Let's get home.

20:22.420 --> 20:24.070
Daddy's got a new pair of shoes.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.400
And he completes the lap.

20:28.570 --> 20:31.990
But how much have high heels hampered his handling?

20:32.530 --> 20:33.340
How did I do?

20:33.340 --> 20:34.830
I don't know, what do you think?

20:35.420 --> 20:38.400
I feel like, if anything, I was a couple seconds slow.

20:38.780 --> 20:41.020
Nope, you were right on the money, 1'17.

20:41.020 --> 20:41.960
No way!

20:41.960 --> 20:42.590
Yep.

20:42.590 --> 20:45.480
Adam has matched his control time exactly.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.110
1 minute and 17.

20:47.430 --> 20:48.880
But will there be a spike...

20:48.880 --> 20:49.680
All right!

20:49.680 --> 20:51.120
in Jamie's lap time?

20:51.170 --> 20:53.300
You know, I might have a problem doing this,

20:53.450 --> 20:55.990
if I was more insecure than I am.

20:56.390 --> 20:58.830
As it is, it's just another day on the job.

20:59.500 --> 21:00.350
All right.

21:00.350 --> 21:02.690
High-heeled shoes driving test

21:02.690 --> 21:06.180
in 3, 2, 1, go.

21:07.580 --> 21:10.630
Jamie tries his hardest to put the pedal to the metal.

21:11.070 --> 21:14.910
I think I'm getting a sense to where this story comes from.

21:14.910 --> 21:16.390
So far so good.

21:16.790 --> 21:18.990
I mean, just look at these things.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.420
They look awkward.

21:20.420 --> 21:21.880
They feel awkward.

21:23.610 --> 21:24.710
How do you think you did?

21:24.980 --> 21:26.460
I don't know, about the same?

21:26.570 --> 21:29.630
Exactly the same, 1 minute 21 seconds.

21:29.910 --> 21:31.000
Well there you go.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.370
Time to move it up a notch.

21:33.950 --> 21:35.550
You ready with the wedges?

21:35.940 --> 21:39.020
I'm totally ready and I'm sparkly.

21:39.020 --> 21:39.620
Go!

21:39.620 --> 21:41.330
Now in the shop tests,

21:41.330 --> 21:44.630
the wedges had a worse reaction time than the stilettos.

21:44.630 --> 21:48.290
I felt my foot catch a little bit on the accelerator pedal there.

21:48.330 --> 21:49.580
But on the track,

21:49.580 --> 21:51.540
I don't really feel,

21:53.600 --> 21:55.220
like it is getting in the way.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.560
for both Adam

21:57.940 --> 21:59.030
One eighteen.

21:59.710 --> 22:01.070
and Jamie,

22:02.550 --> 22:04.850
1 minute 22 seconds.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.570
Pretty much right on the money.

22:06.830 --> 22:08.910
it's left them with one last pair.

22:08.910 --> 22:11.490
The worst case scenario shoes of all.

22:11.810 --> 22:13.410
- Let's do it. - OK.

22:13.410 --> 22:17.360
Snow boots in 3, 2, 1, go.

22:17.870 --> 22:18.960
In their shop tests,

22:18.960 --> 22:22.440
these bunny boots showed seriously dangerous tendencies.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.280
I got my foot stuck behind the brake.

22:24.280 --> 22:26.580
The early signs are promising.

22:30.270 --> 22:32.140
I might have lost some time there.

22:32.140 --> 22:35.920
But the stop watch barely skips a beat.

22:36.190 --> 22:37.560
One nineteen.

22:37.760 --> 22:40.850
One nineteen, wow, just a little bit slower.

22:40.910 --> 22:41.860
Not by much though.

22:41.860 --> 22:45.380
I'd say that's also within an acceptable margin of error.

22:45.380 --> 22:47.020
That's crazy!

22:47.120 --> 22:49.350
And Jamie's snow boot time.

22:51.350 --> 22:53.310
On the money. One twenty one.

22:53.710 --> 22:55.980
And we've tried hard to crack the experiment,

22:55.980 --> 22:59.160
that we tease out any difference in types of footwear

22:59.160 --> 23:01.300
and their effect on your ability to drive.

23:01.300 --> 23:03.290
We built a course that required

23:03.290 --> 23:06.070
lots of precision driving maneuvers.

23:06.070 --> 23:08.560
And after all this testing,

23:08.690 --> 23:12.110
we can't discern that there's any significant differents

23:12.190 --> 23:14.870
between any of these shoes and how they affect

23:14.870 --> 23:17.200
your ability to percisely drive.

23:18.790 --> 23:21.770
None of the shoe styles we tried made any difference

23:21.770 --> 23:23.210
whatsoever in the timing.

23:23.210 --> 23:23.790
No.

23:23.790 --> 23:25.420
And I think we got a pretty good spectrum there too.

23:25.430 --> 23:27.070
I got to say, this is busted.

23:27.140 --> 23:28.320
They're really busted.

23:28.320 --> 23:29.530
Let's get out of here.

23:30.440 --> 23:32.490
You do realize that this is

23:32.490 --> 23:35.110
what's gonna stick with us throughout eternity?

23:35.780 --> 23:39.020
Still to come, Adam brings his bladder to the brink.

23:39.020 --> 23:41.530
I really, really, really need to go.

23:41.530 --> 23:46.170
But next, can super adhesive stand in for a seat belt?

23:46.180 --> 23:47.930
That's incredible!

23:50.100 --> 23:52.570
Do not try what you're about to see at home.

23:52.570 --> 23:54.730
We're what you call experts.

23:59.060 --> 24:00.990
In super adhesive heroics,

24:00.990 --> 24:02.720
All right, go go go!

24:02.720 --> 24:05.330
the glue is one up with one to play.

24:05.330 --> 24:08.790
Time to put the glue in the driver's seat.

24:10.010 --> 24:11.600
Ok, super adhesive seat belt.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.090
This is the idea that you can glue

24:13.090 --> 24:14.470
yourself to the car seat

24:14.470 --> 24:17.130
instead of using a seat belt to survive a crash.

24:17.130 --> 24:18.840
We really want to give this a chance for working.

24:18.840 --> 24:20.480
Why don't we get a car with leather seats,

24:20.480 --> 24:22.430
that way we have a better bonding surface.

24:22.430 --> 24:24.200
Ok, so car with leather seats,

24:24.320 --> 24:25.430
we set up a towing system.

24:25.430 --> 24:27.660
We crash it into a wall at regular street speed,

24:27.660 --> 24:30.800
and put one guy in a seat with a seat belt,

24:30.800 --> 24:33.090
and the other guy with super glue only and compare.

24:33.090 --> 24:33.960
Sounds good.

24:33.990 --> 24:35.370
Sounds real good.

24:35.520 --> 24:37.360
Anyone who doesn't use a seat belt

24:37.360 --> 24:39.000
should get their head examined.

24:39.260 --> 24:41.200
But if your seat belt's not working,

24:41.200 --> 24:44.020
the fan site suggests that super adhesive

24:44.020 --> 24:47.560
can secure you to your seat and even save your life.

24:48.370 --> 24:50.840
To peel the sticky facts from fiction,

24:50.840 --> 24:52.130
it is off to the runway.

24:52.130 --> 24:53.480
Ok, this is just nuts.

24:53.480 --> 24:56.190
We're gonna crash some cars, so that's gonna be cool.

24:57.230 --> 24:58.530
With cars to be crashed,

24:58.530 --> 25:01.670
the guys rolled out a classic Mythbusters' tow system.

25:02.110 --> 25:03.160
Here we go.

25:03.170 --> 25:05.110
Complete with concrete k-rails,

25:05.110 --> 25:07.690
I can't believe they continue to rent these to us.

25:07.690 --> 25:09.770
and a car with the right stuff.

25:09.880 --> 25:12.180
So for a super adhesive seat belt myth,

25:12.180 --> 25:14.550
we've got perfect car.

25:14.550 --> 25:17.850
It's got lether seat to give us the best chance of adhesion.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.190
We're gonna have two passengers.

25:20.190 --> 25:22.880
One is gonna be super glued onto the seat,

25:22.880 --> 25:26.140
the one in the other side is gonna have no super glue at all,

25:26.140 --> 25:28.580
that's our control, so we can compare the damage.

25:28.960 --> 25:31.550
The glue free control job goes to Buster.

25:31.550 --> 25:32.470
Buster loves me.

25:32.470 --> 25:34.490
I've sewn him together so many times.

25:35.730 --> 25:39.330
Strapped under a standard seat belt, he's a little put out.

25:39.550 --> 25:40.970
Deal with it, Buster.

25:40.970 --> 25:44.600
Because taking on the danger of the super adhesive hot seat

25:44.600 --> 25:46.810
will be a brand new mythbuster.

25:46.810 --> 25:49.740
I'd like to introduce you to Buster 4.0.

25:49.740 --> 25:51.370
He is a calibrated test instrument

25:51.380 --> 25:53.440
or better known as a crash test dummy.

25:53.440 --> 25:54.870
We're gonna break him in,

25:54.870 --> 25:57.090
well pretty fitting, a car crash.

25:57.220 --> 25:58.580
You can have fun!

25:59.940 --> 26:01.640
We got to break in somehow.

26:02.010 --> 26:04.700
To secure him in the super adhesive hot seat,

26:04.700 --> 26:06.600
the guys stick both his jump suit

26:06.600 --> 26:09.530
and his rubber skin to the leather interior.

26:09.680 --> 26:11.880
We don't recommand you to do this at home.

26:11.980 --> 26:13.760
This belted brace approach will give

26:13.770 --> 26:16.180
Buster 4.0 the best chance of

26:16.180 --> 26:19.730
success in a 35 miles per hour head-on crash.

26:19.900 --> 26:22.710
All right, let's see how strong this glue really is.

26:22.910 --> 26:25.370
In the tow car, Grant hits the gas.

26:25.780 --> 26:28.530
The pully spin up towards the target speed.

26:28.700 --> 26:30.930
20, 25.

26:31.150 --> 26:32.070
Looking good.

26:32.070 --> 26:35.430
And Buster 4.0 hopes he'll stick it out.

26:39.250 --> 26:41.670
Looks like he came right out of his seat,

26:41.720 --> 26:44.360
and smashed into the windshield with his head.

26:45.250 --> 26:46.370
That is a headache.

26:46.370 --> 26:48.560
That is not a good seat belt.

26:50.230 --> 26:52.970
Well that's one way to break a new crash test dummy.

26:52.970 --> 26:55.300
But you know what, the glue didn't hold at all.

26:55.300 --> 26:57.390
His head smashed right through the windshield.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.330
Except for the super adhesive seat belt,

26:59.330 --> 27:01.600
the test worked perfectly.

27:01.600 --> 27:04.180
We got our car with the two busters up to 35 miles an hour

27:04.190 --> 27:06.460
and he crashed straight into the k-rail.

27:06.460 --> 27:08.680
And no big surprise, the glue did not

27:08.680 --> 27:10.020
hold him in his seat.

27:10.020 --> 27:12.330
Now the Buster with the seat belt stayed in his seat,

27:12.330 --> 27:14.210
had no damage whatsoever.

27:14.420 --> 27:17.190
Yep, seat belt Buster is alive and kicking.

27:17.530 --> 27:20.720
But his stuck up buddy is down for the count.

27:20.810 --> 27:21.960
So what's gone wrong?

27:21.960 --> 27:25.000
Looks like the materials didn't really stick to the seats,

27:25.000 --> 27:26.490
but it is not the glue's fault.

27:26.490 --> 27:28.420
The glue actually held.

27:28.460 --> 27:30.070
Yeah I think we should try this again.

27:30.070 --> 27:31.950
And maybe we cover with the seat with

27:31.950 --> 27:33.970
something that's a little stronger and

27:33.970 --> 27:35.530
put him in a material that's

27:35.540 --> 27:36.860
gonna bond to it.

27:36.860 --> 27:38.710
Incredibly, it was the material

27:38.710 --> 27:41.840
that gave way on the seat and the clothes.

27:42.670 --> 27:44.230
So for crash test two,

27:44.230 --> 27:47.150
Tori's replacing their new car's regular seat

27:48.060 --> 27:50.500
while Kari and Grant work on buster.

27:50.500 --> 27:52.830
So in addition to replacing our lether seat,

27:52.830 --> 27:54.580
we're also doing away with the jump suit,

27:54.580 --> 27:56.850
replacing it with a rubberized wet suit.

27:56.850 --> 27:57.540
Why you ask?

27:57.540 --> 27:59.200
It make his look really good.

27:59.210 --> 28:02.640
We get the best possible bonding surface for our glue.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.630
And that rubber suit will be sticking to

28:04.630 --> 28:07.460
a glue friendly fiberglass racing seat.

28:07.460 --> 28:09.120
This way when we glue Buster in,

28:09.120 --> 28:11.350
we're glueing rubber against fiberglass,

28:11.350 --> 28:13.130
that's two nonporous materials.

28:13.130 --> 28:14.810
So hopefully, he will actually stay

28:14.810 --> 28:16.920
in the seat this time we crash the car.

28:17.210 --> 28:20.280
In addition, the body hugging contours on the racing seat

28:20.280 --> 28:23.380
mean there's more surface area to stick to Buster.

28:23.390 --> 28:26.270
Oh yeah, there you go. That's a good fit.

28:26.280 --> 28:28.630
But it's still a huge ask.

28:30.350 --> 28:33.540
All right. This is test two.

28:33.690 --> 28:36.870
Rubberized suit and hard plastic seat.

28:36.880 --> 28:40.000
In 3, 2, 1, go!

28:41.170 --> 28:43.410
10, 15.

28:43.980 --> 28:45.740
Looking good.

28:45.840 --> 28:48.440
20, 30 miles an hour.

28:48.720 --> 28:49.800
Here we go.

28:53.040 --> 28:56.860
It looks like he just got ripped right out of that seat.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.790
Well, it's pretty obvious it didn't hold.

29:00.560 --> 29:01.890
I'm pretty comfortable at this point

29:01.890 --> 29:04.970
saying super adhesive seatbelt totally busted.

29:04.970 --> 29:08.170
Which means that to put the super in super adhesive,

29:08.300 --> 29:10.520
guys will have to take this myth to the max.

29:17.910 --> 29:20.080
So driving drunk versus driving with a full bladder

29:20.080 --> 29:22.640
seems like a pretty straightforward set of tests to me.

29:22.640 --> 29:24.980
Let's do this one with the regular driving test style course.

29:24.980 --> 29:27.550
You know, maneuvering, parallel parking etc.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.290
Do it once with a full bladder,

29:29.300 --> 29:30.650
once at the legal limit.

29:30.730 --> 29:31.970
You know, we should be careful.

29:31.970 --> 29:33.790
We don't want to rupture your bladder.

29:33.790 --> 29:37.200
So what say we get a medical professional in to supervise.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.330
Let's get to drive.

29:39.010 --> 29:42.500
The dangers of driving while drunk are well established facts.

29:42.500 --> 29:45.470
But a recent study has suggested that an overfilled bladder

29:45.470 --> 29:50.080
can make driving more hazardous than being intoxicated.

29:50.260 --> 29:52.800
Is it possible that being desperate to pee

29:52.800 --> 29:56.070
makes you drive as badly as being over the limit?

29:56.500 --> 29:57.510
Well to find out,

29:57.510 --> 30:00.060
it's back to the asphalt heaven, Aalameda.

30:00.060 --> 30:02.290
It is a perfect day for driving.

30:02.730 --> 30:04.800
Even if doing it dangerously.

30:04.800 --> 30:05.910
Especially!

30:05.910 --> 30:07.900
This time it's out with the stunt driving

30:07.900 --> 30:10.680
and in with something all together more traditional,

30:10.680 --> 30:13.060
a standard driver instruction course

30:13.170 --> 30:15.720
with a few well chosen distractions.

30:15.810 --> 30:18.560
Well you know, when you got to go, you got to go.

30:20.570 --> 30:22.330
Allow me to show you our course.

30:22.330 --> 30:25.890
It begins and ends right here with a one mile long

30:25.890 --> 30:28.140
very tight straight away.

30:28.140 --> 30:31.770
This will test my powers of concentration and endurance,

30:31.770 --> 30:34.940
both with a full bladder and under the influence of alcohol.

30:35.240 --> 30:39.250
So the next part of the course is a very narrow, snakey little curve,

30:39.250 --> 30:41.910
- followed by... - The roundabout.

30:41.910 --> 30:43.000
I will enter over here,

30:43.000 --> 30:47.710
and make three complete circuits of it before exiting towards...

30:48.230 --> 30:49.400
The slalom.

30:49.490 --> 30:51.500
First he goes through it forward,

30:51.500 --> 30:54.320
then he has to go out in reverse,

30:54.400 --> 30:57.310
- and move on to... - A very straightforward,

30:57.310 --> 31:00.020
yet most difficult part of the driving test,

31:00.300 --> 31:01.700
the parallel park.

31:01.710 --> 31:04.640
This is the ultimate maneuver before...

31:05.140 --> 31:06.290
The final test,

31:06.290 --> 31:09.010
which is where Adam will have to respond to random

31:09.010 --> 31:11.850
change of these traffic lights that will tells him

31:11.850 --> 31:14.520
which lane he has to swerve into at speed.

31:14.520 --> 31:15.990
They'll judge Adam's driving

31:15.990 --> 31:19.290
on how he preforms each maneuver as well as on his speed.

31:19.290 --> 31:22.690
Adam can't exceed 20 miles an hour going down the straightaway.

31:22.770 --> 31:24.450
When he's doing the obstacle course,

31:24.450 --> 31:26.490
he can't exceed 25 miles an hour,

31:26.500 --> 31:29.660
and can't hit any cones or any pedestrians.

31:29.660 --> 31:31.540
Sober, with an empty bladder,

31:31.540 --> 31:33.880
Adam peels off three practice laps to

31:33.880 --> 31:35.630
get to grips with the course.

31:35.640 --> 31:37.790
And by starting with the full bladder test,

31:37.790 --> 31:41.710
Adam can enjoy his hangover once the testing is well and truely over.

31:41.710 --> 31:43.460
What's with the urgency room tent?

31:43.460 --> 31:44.870
Well this experiment about me getting

31:44.870 --> 31:46.920
a full bladder is not as simple

31:46.920 --> 31:48.620
as drinking a ton of water,

31:48.620 --> 31:50.320
having to pee, and then driving.

31:50.320 --> 31:53.300
The fact is, you actually can drink too much water

31:53.300 --> 31:56.030
and create a potentially dangerous situation.

31:56.030 --> 31:58.930
That's why this whole experiment's gonna be monitored by a doctor,

31:58.940 --> 32:01.070
a urologist, doctor Hsu here.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.270
He going to ultrasound my bladder

32:03.270 --> 32:05.260
to make sure my bladder is pumply full

32:05.260 --> 32:08.260
and yet, I don't die, which is, you know, good.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.480
And get this, I already have to pee a little bit.

32:10.480 --> 32:11.880
So we're like ahead of the game.

32:11.880 --> 32:14.140
Your bladder actually has 174 ccs in there,

32:14.140 --> 32:16.130
average bladder has about 350 to 400.

32:16.130 --> 32:17.840
So you're about halfway full right now.

32:17.840 --> 32:20.100
What you're saying that is I should probably drink

32:20.100 --> 32:21.770
like 180 ccs of water right now.

32:21.770 --> 32:24.060
- More like 300. - 300!?

32:24.060 --> 32:25.540
- You'll be fine. - Ok.

32:25.540 --> 32:29.350
It can take up to an hour before a drink trickles into the bladder.

32:29.350 --> 32:30.340
Here we go.

32:30.730 --> 32:32.650
300 milliliters down the hatch.

32:32.650 --> 32:36.170
But a drink this size and Adam's bladder already half full,

32:36.170 --> 32:39.210
in just 20 minutes, he's feeling the pressure.

32:39.490 --> 32:40.290
How you doing?

32:40.290 --> 32:42.740
I definitely really have to go.

32:42.820 --> 32:45.540
But I think I should wait just a little longer.

32:45.540 --> 32:49.270
Another ten minutes, and Adam thinks he is full to the brim.

32:50.880 --> 32:52.130
Yeah I feel a lot of pressure.

32:52.130 --> 32:54.510
However the ultrasound identifies room

32:54.510 --> 32:56.430
for even further extension.

32:56.430 --> 32:58.910
Ok. I am gonna drink a little more water.

32:59.080 --> 33:02.280
100 mills, and five minutes later,

33:02.280 --> 33:04.490
Adam really is myth busting.

33:04.490 --> 33:07.160
I really, really, really need to go.

33:07.160 --> 33:08.950
But before he goes,

33:09.580 --> 33:11.430
I am ready for the full bladder test.

33:11.430 --> 33:13.870
Jamie wants to outline the scoring system,

33:13.900 --> 33:17.230
in excruciatingly slow detail.

33:17.360 --> 33:18.710
The way we're gonna score this test is

33:18.710 --> 33:20.510
Adam starts out with 100 points.

33:20.510 --> 33:22.080
Every time he does something wrong,

33:22.080 --> 33:23.780
we subtract some points.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.200
Now each cone is worth five points.

33:26.210 --> 33:27.120
Oh, my god.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.750
I can't even tell you how badly I have to pee right now.

33:29.760 --> 33:34.970
Every time he screws up the test, that's 20 points.

33:36.530 --> 33:39.350
And every mile per hour over the speed limit he goes,

33:39.450 --> 33:41.030
that's 5 points.

33:41.030 --> 33:42.180
Let's do it.

33:42.430 --> 33:43.970
Pedestrians that he can hit,

33:43.970 --> 33:46.370
well, let's just say that's a lot of points.

33:46.370 --> 33:48.190
We'll worry about that when we get there.

33:48.470 --> 33:55.620
- Bladder control test in 3...2... - He's such a...

33:56.130 --> 34:00.780
- Man, I am gonna get even. - One.

34:08.940 --> 34:12.620
In 2006, a team of scientists at Wake Forest University

34:12.620 --> 34:15.659
created the world's first lab-grown bladder

34:15.659 --> 34:18.980
and successfully transplanted it into a human.

34:20.690 --> 34:23.110
Two crash tests have proved it.

34:23.710 --> 34:26.340
Super adhesive is no seat belt.

34:27.909 --> 34:29.070
Not yet.

34:30.130 --> 34:31.580
So far we have been having no luck

34:31.580 --> 34:33.530
with our super adhesive seat belt myth.

34:33.530 --> 34:36.040
The failures are in the clothing the dummies were wearing

34:36.040 --> 34:37.940
or in the seats themselves.

34:37.940 --> 34:39.929
What we need to do is focus on

34:39.929 --> 34:42.480
the strength of the bond of the glue.

34:42.520 --> 34:44.370
We're doing that by giving the

34:44.370 --> 34:48.130
glue an ideal bonding surface--two steel plates.

34:48.130 --> 34:49.900
One's gonna go on the dummy's back,

34:49.900 --> 34:53.420
and the other is going to go on a special new metal seat

34:53.420 --> 34:55.630
that I'll be installing into the vehicle.

34:55.630 --> 34:58.050
By taking the fabrics out of the equation,

34:58.060 --> 34:59.950
the guys are putting the glue

34:59.950 --> 35:03.150
and glue alone to the ultimate crash test.

35:03.300 --> 35:05.080
May not be the most comfortable seat.

35:05.080 --> 35:08.680
But if it works, Buster's gonna be glad he has it.

35:10.020 --> 35:11.090
We're back at the runway,

35:11.100 --> 35:12.530
and we're all set up for another crash.

35:12.530 --> 35:13.720
Because we wanna find out

35:13.720 --> 35:16.150
if just the bond from super adhesive

35:16.210 --> 35:18.780
can withstand the forces of a car crash.

35:19.560 --> 35:21.330
This time there will be no clothes ripping,

35:21.330 --> 35:22.990
there will be no seat tearing.

35:22.990 --> 35:24.460
We're not fooling around.

35:24.460 --> 35:26.980
We've two identical super flat steel plates.

35:26.980 --> 35:29.130
This one is welded onto buster's frame,

35:29.130 --> 35:31.330
and the other welded into the car.

35:31.330 --> 35:35.420
And those two are stuck together with, yep, you guessed it.

35:35.420 --> 35:39.140
But will the super adhesive finally keep buster in the hot seat?

35:39.850 --> 35:41.580
All right, for our final experiment,

35:41.580 --> 35:43.750
we have the same circumstances as before.

35:43.750 --> 35:46.920
Here we go in 3, 2, 1.

35:47.240 --> 35:48.860
Looks good.

35:48.870 --> 35:51.610
We have one Buster just seat-belted in the passenger side

35:51.610 --> 35:55.090
and we have our main Buster, with two metal plates,

35:55.090 --> 35:58.880
super adhesive glued together, sitting in the driver's seat.

35:58.880 --> 36:01.460
Straight headed towards the K-rails.

36:03.690 --> 36:04.900
Hey, you know that might have worked!

36:04.910 --> 36:06.540
It might have worked!

36:07.700 --> 36:09.150
Well, what do you think?

36:09.910 --> 36:11.410
The plate's still connected.

36:11.410 --> 36:13.710
It actually withstood the crash.

36:13.720 --> 36:15.160
That's incredible.

36:15.160 --> 36:17.260
That's quite a super adhesive.

36:17.460 --> 36:18.410
This is incredible.

36:18.410 --> 36:19.800
He actually held on.

36:19.800 --> 36:22.380
The glue was strong enough to withstand this shock.

36:23.770 --> 36:24.840
I'm impressed.

36:24.950 --> 36:25.840
So am I.

36:25.840 --> 36:28.060
The super adhesive has stuck fast.

36:28.060 --> 36:32.990
And during an impact, impacting 16,000 pounds of force.

36:33.160 --> 36:36.450
Now in theory, super adhesive should have more than enough

36:36.450 --> 36:39.280
holding power to withstand the force of the bump in a car crash.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.630
And it turns out it does.

36:41.630 --> 36:43.910
But this myth is still busted,

36:43.910 --> 36:46.020
because unless you have a steel skeleton

36:46.020 --> 36:49.070
with a 12 inch square steel plate welded to your back

36:49.070 --> 36:51.420
and a identical 12 inch square plate

36:51.420 --> 36:54.860
welded to a steel immovable chair in your car,

36:54.860 --> 36:56.610
it's not gonna work for you.

36:56.830 --> 36:58.730
Please, use a seat belt.

36:59.260 --> 37:02.010
Well, not going home in that car.

37:02.150 --> 37:03.120
Nope!

37:11.970 --> 37:13.640
At the other end of the runway,

37:13.660 --> 37:15.390
Adam couldn't be more ready

37:15.390 --> 37:17.840
to test his bladder impaired concentration.

37:17.850 --> 37:22.650
Bladder control test in 3, 2...

37:23.860 --> 37:25.220
Man, I'm gonna get even.

37:25.830 --> 37:27.820
One. Go.

37:29.290 --> 37:32.190
The first challenge is the mile long straight way,

37:32.190 --> 37:34.930
with a speed limit set at 20 miles an hour.

37:38.280 --> 37:39.650
It is taking so long.

37:39.660 --> 37:43.260
And it is clear that Adam's feeling the pressure.

37:44.020 --> 37:45.980
Oh man, I can feel that pressure.

37:47.230 --> 37:49.870
Next up is three turns of the roundabout.

37:50.220 --> 37:51.590
Ok, here I go.

37:52.210 --> 37:53.370
He only did two.

37:53.720 --> 37:55.230
He's supposed to do three.

37:55.620 --> 37:58.220
With his bladder becoming fuller by the minute.

37:58.700 --> 37:59.930
Oh man, this hurts.

37:59.930 --> 38:01.310
This is killing me!

38:01.940 --> 38:03.290
There's a cone.

38:03.490 --> 38:05.700
Adam's concentration is slipping.

38:05.700 --> 38:06.990
This is awful.

38:07.300 --> 38:08.340
Parallel parking.

38:08.340 --> 38:11.430
I wish I was parking so I could pee, but I can't.

38:15.240 --> 38:18.250
While he grimaces through accident avoidance,

38:19.300 --> 38:21.080
Oh, yes!

38:22.330 --> 38:24.880
it's the long, slow mile home,

38:25.230 --> 38:27.580
Uranation is only minutes away.

38:27.800 --> 38:31.410
lied with Jamie's deliberately distracting portable toilets.

38:33.300 --> 38:34.940
That's the hardest of all.

38:37.890 --> 38:39.490
But at last, he's finished.

38:40.230 --> 38:41.430
How did I do?

38:41.480 --> 38:42.780
Can I make a pee?

38:44.070 --> 38:45.930
Well, first you got to do a piece to the camera I think.

38:45.930 --> 38:47.660
- No. - No?

38:48.310 --> 38:50.150
I'll see you in a minute, OK?

38:52.470 --> 38:54.050
Adam is relieved.

38:54.820 --> 38:56.690
But a full bladder absolutely

38:56.690 --> 38:59.380
dented his concentration behind the wheel.

38:59.780 --> 39:02.300
As for his score, well, that comes later.

39:02.300 --> 39:03.910
We're making a point of not telling Adam

39:03.910 --> 39:05.630
how he did on the full bladder test

39:05.630 --> 39:08.970
so it doesn't skew how he does when intoxicated.

39:11.280 --> 39:12.700
All right, fun's over.

39:13.510 --> 39:15.980
Remember, Adam's full bladder driving

39:15.980 --> 39:20.180
will be tested against the benchmark for driving impairment, alcohol.

39:20.180 --> 39:23.040
Legally we can't actually have anybody driving

39:23.040 --> 39:25.250
while fully intoxicated.

39:25.710 --> 39:27.150
What we can do, however,

39:27.160 --> 39:29.610
is bring Adam right up to the limit,

39:29.610 --> 39:32.420
just under it and have him drive then,

39:32.430 --> 39:34.890
with the supervision of law enforcement here.

39:34.900 --> 39:38.150
And they're going to be using a breathalyzer on him.

39:38.150 --> 39:39.670
We'll know exactly where he's at,

39:39.670 --> 39:42.430
make sure we don't actually break the law.

39:42.670 --> 39:46.440
With California law allowing a .08 alcohol reading,

39:46.690 --> 39:47.660
Almost there.

39:48.290 --> 39:49.660
Adam's ripe.

39:49.990 --> 39:53.800
.75. I think that's actually our butter zone.

39:53.800 --> 39:57.790
I have never driven anything as altered as I am now.

39:57.790 --> 39:59.280
I can't believe the legal limit

39:59.280 --> 40:03.650
honestly is as high as it purportedly is.

40:03.650 --> 40:05.240
And to be on the safe side,

40:05.240 --> 40:06.810
the police tag along.

40:07.150 --> 40:09.020
OK, Adam, are you ready?

40:09.390 --> 40:10.740
I'm ready, sir.

40:11.430 --> 40:14.680
3, 2, 1 go.

40:16.820 --> 40:18.880
But in the first slow straight away,

40:18.880 --> 40:21.210
the officer might be reconsidering.

40:21.840 --> 40:24.770
That's gonna be a dog leg left turn.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.660
I hit a cone.

40:26.930 --> 40:29.110
OK, here comes the first dog leg.

40:29.540 --> 40:31.130
Because like the bladder test,

40:31.130 --> 40:32.520
I hit a cone.

40:32.520 --> 40:35.750
it's clear that Adam's driving is impaired.

40:36.180 --> 40:39.830
Left turn, into three loop to loops.

40:41.430 --> 40:42.540
Did I hit another cone?

40:42.540 --> 40:43.390
That's two.

40:43.390 --> 40:48.940
But how does his almost illegally boozed up brain

40:49.900 --> 40:51.260
That was bad.

40:51.260 --> 40:55.360
compared to the tolerated distraction...

40:55.820 --> 40:58.590
That's accident avoidance. Here we go.

40:58.990 --> 41:00.760
of a busting bladder.

41:00.890 --> 41:02.250
You made that one all right,

41:02.250 --> 41:03.460
but just barely.

41:03.460 --> 41:04.800
Now back home again.

41:04.800 --> 41:06.670
Well, once Adam is done,

41:06.780 --> 41:09.010
it's almost time to find out.

41:09.410 --> 41:10.550
Hi, Jamie!

41:11.380 --> 41:12.590
Hi, Adam.

41:12.860 --> 41:14.460
How did I do on that one?

41:14.490 --> 41:15.560
Not so good.

41:15.560 --> 41:16.910
Really?

41:16.910 --> 41:17.740
Yeah.

41:17.740 --> 41:19.090
Oh, shoot.

41:19.510 --> 41:22.250
I kept on talking and losing focus.

41:22.290 --> 41:23.350
I'm not surprised.

41:25.480 --> 41:28.830
I have to see what Jamie's numbers say for the final analysis.

41:28.830 --> 41:31.830
I am not necessarily in a position to make a judgment,

41:31.830 --> 41:33.040
but I have to tell you,

41:33.040 --> 41:37.040
I was far less capable of driving intoxicated

41:37.060 --> 41:39.080
than when I had a full bladder.

41:39.080 --> 41:40.800
I was in pain with the full bladder,

41:40.800 --> 41:42.450
but intoxicated,

41:42.450 --> 41:47.040
I just didn't have the ability to focus on several things at once.

41:47.100 --> 41:50.250
And with a possible 100 points per test,

41:50.280 --> 41:51.510
the results are.

41:51.580 --> 41:53.360
Driving with a full bladder

41:53.800 --> 41:57.360
gave you a score of 70 points.

41:57.450 --> 41:58.470
Oh, that's not bad.

41:58.940 --> 42:00.410
Driving while intoxicated

42:00.410 --> 42:02.450
gave you 25 points.

42:03.500 --> 42:06.450
So the myth that driving with a full bladder

42:06.450 --> 42:09.550
is just as bad as driving while intoxicated is?

42:09.930 --> 42:10.880
Busted.

42:11.270 --> 42:12.140
Great.

42:12.140 --> 42:13.350
Let's get out of here.

42:13.770 --> 42:14.510
I'm driving.

42:14.510 --> 42:16.230
OK, good. I'm happy about that.

42:16.230 --> 42:18.330
Yep, the numbers don't lie.

42:16.510 --> 42:28.630
{n8}{pos(182,4)}████

42:18.330 --> 42:20.790
Driving drunk is far worse.

42:20.800 --> 42:24.760
But full bladder driving is a serious road risk.

42:24.770 --> 42:25.960
So here's the news,

42:25.960 --> 42:28.490
if you need to pee, pull over!

42:29.950 --> 42:32.230
I love you, thank you for driving!

42:32.420 --> 42:33.460
I am!

42:35.990 --> 42:36.950
Have you had enough?

42:36.950 --> 42:38.300
Of course you haven't.

42:38.300 --> 42:43.100
