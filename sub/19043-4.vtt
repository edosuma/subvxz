11:05.091 --> 11:06.590
But with this kind of
foot traffic,

11:06.592 --> 11:08.725
You're gonna see substantial
smashing and matting

11:08.727 --> 11:10.727
In less than
five years.

11:10.729 --> 11:13.796
But I'm telling you,
you get you a good
multi-level loop--

11:13.798 --> 11:15.063
Mm, it'll last you
a long time.

11:15.065 --> 11:16.597
In my opinion.

11:16.599 --> 11:20.601
A mult--
that's fascinating.
Multi-level loop.

11:20.603 --> 11:23.837
- Uhh. You sound like
a scientist.

11:23.839 --> 11:25.338
Oh, what's this?

11:25.340 --> 11:27.573
Hi. Would you like
to take a photo?

11:27.575 --> 11:30.275
- Oh, I don't know.
- Oh, come on,
it'll be fun.

11:30.277 --> 11:33.077
- Come on. Come on.
- All right, all right,
all right.

11:33.079 --> 11:35.545
Ooh. Okay.

11:37.347 --> 11:39.948
Ready?
And say reagan.

11:39.950 --> 11:42.116
Both: Reagan.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.817
Christine: Practically
a photo shoot in here.

11:45.353 --> 11:48.920
I love that.
I just love this.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.090
- Woman: Hello.
- Christine: Hi.

11:53.092 --> 11:55.525
Can I show you anything
in this case?

11:55.527 --> 11:58.794
I'm just browsing.
Thank you so much.

11:58.796 --> 12:00.128
You're welcome.

12:00.130 --> 12:02.830
Oh, look who caught
the reagan bug.

12:02.832 --> 12:05.699
No, no, no, now,
I need this cup
for the hotel.

12:05.701 --> 12:06.833
- Oh?
- 'cause the cups in
the hotel are paper,

12:06.835 --> 12:08.167
And they're
very flimsy.

12:08.169 --> 12:10.435
So you're not gonna change
your affiliation?

12:10.437 --> 12:12.270
- Are you kiddin' me?

12:12.272 --> 12:14.005
- Did you find something?
- Well, I thought

12:14.007 --> 12:15.806
This might be nice
for chip,

12:15.808 --> 12:19.176
But I can't remember his size,
he has such an odd shape,

12:19.178 --> 12:21.945
So I thought I'd
give him a call.

12:28.851 --> 12:30.551
I'm a petite portly,
mom.

12:30.553 --> 12:32.519
<i>A what?</i>
<i>Could you just</i>

12:32.521 --> 12:34.654
<i>Come over to the gift shop</i>
<i>and try it on?</i>

12:34.656 --> 12:37.156
Uh... Yeah.
I just-- I don't--

12:37.158 --> 12:40.159
I'm not sure where
that is, uh, so--

12:40.161 --> 12:42.194
<i>It's right behind</i>
<i>the iron curtain,</i>

12:42.196 --> 12:43.662
And the motorcade.

12:43.664 --> 12:45.730
- Okay, um, just, um--
- <i>where are you?</i>

12:45.732 --> 12:50.534
I'm walking around.
I'm right now I'm at
the, uh, monkey exhibit.

12:50.536 --> 12:53.236
The monkey ex--
the monkey exhibit?

12:53.238 --> 12:57.006
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.
Okay.

12:57.008 --> 12:59.241
We're here.
Where are you, chip?

12:59.243 --> 13:00.375
<i>Mom,</i>

13:00.377 --> 13:02.477
I'm waving at you.

13:02.479 --> 13:03.744
Waving at me.

13:03.746 --> 13:04.778
Turn to your left.

13:06.480 --> 13:07.546
Your other left.

13:08.681 --> 13:10.248
Where are you?

13:10.250 --> 13:12.483
Mom, my batteries
are going low, okay?

13:12.485 --> 13:13.984
I gotta get
a couple more aas.

13:13.986 --> 13:15.585
<i>Oh, god.</i>

13:17.254 --> 13:19.355
Okay, let's try
this one again.

13:19.357 --> 13:21.490
We've got a little
reaganite named chip

13:21.492 --> 13:23.758
Lost in the museum
somewhere.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.192
He's wearing...

13:25.194 --> 13:27.327
A button down
and a beard.

13:27.329 --> 13:31.030
Uh, chip,
would you please come to the
information desk right away,

13:31.032 --> 13:32.264
- Your mom is waiting for you.
- Let me have it.

13:32.266 --> 13:33.498
Thank you, thank you,
marlena,

13:33.500 --> 13:34.866
I'll take it from here.

13:34.868 --> 13:38.502
Chip, pick up the phone,
it's your mother.

13:38.504 --> 13:43.706
<i>Please. We're gonna miss</i>
<i>the sentencing hearing.</i>

13:43.708 --> 13:46.542
<i>He's gonna go</i>
<i>back to prison.</i>

13:46.544 --> 13:48.844
My daughter's
in prison, too.

13:48.846 --> 13:50.745
Sorry, everyone.
Enjoy this tour.

13:50.747 --> 13:54.582
It's just fascinating to me.
I could spend two days here.

13:54.584 --> 13:57.685
Chip, pick up the phone.

13:57.687 --> 13:59.853
- Oh, kids.

13:59.855 --> 14:01.888
- Thank you, marlena.
- Oh, you're so welcome.

14:01.890 --> 14:03.856
- I hope you find him okay.
- Me, too.

14:03.858 --> 14:06.959
- Can I take a few of these?
- Oh, by all means, please.

14:06.961 --> 14:09.027
It's a lovely,
lovely museum.

14:09.029 --> 14:10.261
I'm glad you're
enjoying it.

14:10.263 --> 14:11.762
Even if you're
a democrat.

14:21.639 --> 14:23.539
Chip:
Thank you, travis.

14:23.541 --> 14:25.707
Best of luck with
those macramé classes.

14:32.213 --> 14:33.246
<i>Chip,</i>

14:33.248 --> 14:34.747
Where the hell
are you?

14:34.749 --> 14:36.749
I'm-- I'm gonna make it
to the courthouse, okay?

14:36.751 --> 14:37.783
I'm just a little late.

14:37.785 --> 14:39.618
Listen,
I put $10,000 down.

14:39.620 --> 14:41.886
That's gonna go
down the drain if
you don't show up.

14:41.888 --> 14:43.721
I promise you
I'll make it to
the hearing,

14:43.723 --> 14:45.756
I just-- there's something
that I need to do, okay?

14:45.758 --> 14:46.890
<i>You'd better be there.</i>

14:46.892 --> 14:48.658
Thank you.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.293
He's gonna
meet us there.

14:51.295 --> 14:52.693
What a world.

15:04.703 --> 15:06.569
May I help you?

15:06.571 --> 15:10.239
Um, yes, uh, hi.
My friend, morpheus,
is here, I think,

15:10.241 --> 15:12.374
And this pan flute
was his favorite thing
in the world.

15:12.376 --> 15:14.242
I was hoping maybe,
you know,

15:14.244 --> 15:15.576
He could rest in peace
with the flute

15:15.578 --> 15:18.245
On top of his chest
or something like that.

15:18.247 --> 15:20.046
Yeah, we can't do
anything like that.

15:20.048 --> 15:22.415
You probably want to
talk to the family.

15:22.417 --> 15:24.283
Oh. Are they here?

15:24.285 --> 15:25.417
I'll check.

15:25.419 --> 15:26.918
Oh. Okay.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.253
Thank you.

15:29.255 --> 15:30.954
Christine: I don't know
what's gotten into him.

15:30.956 --> 15:35.891
If he doesn't make that
sentencing hearing, then--

15:35.893 --> 15:37.559
Oh, it's all my fault.

15:37.561 --> 15:38.860
What do you mean?

15:38.862 --> 15:43.063
Oh, he was so young
when his father died.

15:43.065 --> 15:45.865
I-- I didn't get help
for us.

15:45.867 --> 15:48.700
I really messed it up.
I--

15:49.968 --> 15:53.537
I wasn't prepared
to deal with that.

15:53.539 --> 15:56.806
And how could he,
at nine years old,
be prepared?

15:56.808 --> 16:00.442
It's not your fault,
christine, I promise you.

16:00.444 --> 16:03.111
And the recession
wasn't carter's fault.

16:03.113 --> 16:05.913
If ronald reagan had been
president in 1978,

16:05.915 --> 16:07.714
He would have been
a one-term president.

16:07.716 --> 16:10.783
Some things are just
bigger than the office.

16:10.785 --> 16:12.584
Want a jelly bean?

16:12.586 --> 16:14.886
I'm a diabetic, ken.

16:14.888 --> 16:16.420
And I'm not proud of it.

16:16.422 --> 16:18.722
I know how that goes.

16:18.724 --> 16:21.157
My first wife
was a diabetic.

16:21.159 --> 16:23.325
So I always keep
sugar-free cough drops.

16:23.327 --> 16:28.196
Oh, thank you.
Oh! There's the trolley.

16:29.164 --> 16:31.665
Finally.
A trolley.

16:43.742 --> 16:46.110
Can I help you, son?

16:46.112 --> 16:48.312
Um--

16:48.314 --> 16:49.479
Look, I really don't know
what to say,

16:49.481 --> 16:52.014
But, uh, I--
I knew your son.

16:53.916 --> 16:55.483
You knew stanley?

16:55.485 --> 16:57.284
Who's stanley?

16:57.286 --> 16:59.919
Oh, yes, yes.
I knew him under
a stage name.

16:59.921 --> 17:03.155
Um, but I was with him
when he passed.

17:03.157 --> 17:04.623
Oh, I see.

17:04.625 --> 17:06.324
Come in. Please.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.793
Uh, dorothy, I don't think
we should let him in.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.461
We don't know anything
about this man.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.329
He's stanley's friend.

17:12.331 --> 17:14.798
I don't think we should.
We don't know anything
about him.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.099
Arnold, let--
let him in.

17:17.768 --> 17:20.369
Wish it was a little colder,
but the ice machine's out.

17:20.371 --> 17:21.403
Oh, thank you.

17:33.881 --> 17:36.015
Um...

17:36.017 --> 17:39.051
I have something that I--
that I brought for you, uh,

17:39.053 --> 17:41.620
That I think
you should have.

17:41.622 --> 17:43.321
Maybe you should
have this.

17:43.323 --> 17:44.955
It's your dad's.

17:46.324 --> 17:48.058
What do you say?

17:48.060 --> 17:49.492
Thanks.

17:49.494 --> 17:52.294
He, uh, liked to play
that thing a lot.

17:52.296 --> 17:53.995
Your dad was
a good guy.

17:53.997 --> 17:56.397
He could dance and sing.

17:56.399 --> 17:57.698
He liked trains.

17:59.467 --> 18:02.569
He once, uh, opened
a can of pasta for me.

18:02.571 --> 18:03.703
He did?

18:03.705 --> 18:04.970
Real free spirit.

18:04.972 --> 18:06.905
Stanley loved
buttered noodles.

18:06.907 --> 18:08.206
He did.

18:08.208 --> 18:09.707
Loved them.

18:09.709 --> 18:11.075
I would say
when he was younger,

18:11.077 --> 18:12.843
He wanted them
once a week.

18:12.845 --> 18:14.411
Girl: How do you
play this thing?
