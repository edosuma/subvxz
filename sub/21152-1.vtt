[pop music]

00:11.133 --> 00:14.267
* *

00:14.333 --> 00:17.333
- * Where are you
now that I need ya *

00:17.400 --> 00:20.800
- I was alone,
on the verge of bankruptcy,

00:20.867 --> 00:22.900
with a daughter in college
and a deadbeat husband

00:22.967 --> 00:25.233
who I finally got the guts
to throw out the door.

00:25.300 --> 00:27.200
I worked at Random House
right out of college

00:27.267 --> 00:29.800
for three years before I quit
to raise Caitlin,

00:29.867 --> 00:31.800
My mom passed away that year,

00:31.867 --> 00:34.400
and my daughter needed me.

00:34.467 --> 00:37.233
- * Where are you now
that I need you *

00:37.300 --> 00:39.067
When I was ready
to go back to work,

00:39.133 --> 00:42.100
no one would give me a chance--
literally nobody.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.400
Maggie had this crazy idea
that I lie about my age

00:44.467 --> 00:46.033
on my resume.

00:46.100 --> 00:48.433
I was so desperate,
I was ready to try anything.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.700
- * Where are you
that I need you *

00:50.767 --> 00:52.867
There were so many times
that I wanted to tell you,

00:52.933 --> 00:54.367
but then we started
Millennial,

00:54.433 --> 00:56.867
and I knew you needed
me to be the person

00:56.933 --> 00:59.433
you believed I was.

00:59.500 --> 01:02.133
Sometimes I believed it
myself.

01:02.200 --> 01:05.533
* *

01:05.600 --> 01:08.633
I know it was selfish,
but the longer it went on,

01:08.700 --> 01:11.267
the harder it became
to tell you the truth.

01:13.067 --> 01:14.867
- Why even tell me now?

01:14.933 --> 01:16.500
- Because I couldn't keep
deceiving

01:16.567 --> 01:18.167
the people I love most.

01:19.733 --> 01:21.933
And, Kelsey,
next to my own daughter,

01:22.067 --> 01:24.200
and Maggie,

01:24.267 --> 01:27.067
you're the most precious
thing in the world to me.

01:28.767 --> 01:30.300
- Wow!

01:30.367 --> 01:31.933
I feel like I'm in

01:32.067 --> 01:35.200
an episode of "Black Mirror"
or something.

01:35.267 --> 01:37.833
I think that's all I can
deal with for one night.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.567
We can talk more tomorrow.
- Yeah. We can keep talking

01:41.633 --> 01:43.367
for as long as you like.

01:43.433 --> 01:46.400
Uh...take my room.

01:46.467 --> 01:47.633
I'll sleep with Maggie.

01:47.700 --> 01:49.367
- Thanks.

01:49.433 --> 01:51.433
Good night.
- Night.

01:51.500 --> 01:52.633
- Good night.

01:56.067 --> 01:56.967
"Black Mirror"?

01:57.067 --> 01:59.100
- Beats me.

01:59.167 --> 02:01.067
- [sighs]

02:01.067 --> 02:03.067
- * I showed you the game *
- Thank you.

02:03.100 --> 02:05.367
- * Everybody else
was playin' *

02:05.433 --> 02:07.967
* That's for sure,
that's for sure *

02:08.067 --> 02:11.333
* Where are you now
that I need ya *

02:11.400 --> 02:18.067
* *

02:19.533 --> 02:21.667
- They'll probably fire me.

02:21.733 --> 02:23.433
I just hope
they don't sue me.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.067
You know what?
Let 'em try.

02:25.067 --> 02:26.633
It's not like I have
anything to lose.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.433
- You know, I don't know
why you suddenly

02:28.500 --> 02:30.500
feel the need to unburden
yourself to everyone,

02:30.567 --> 02:32.300
starting with Kelsey.

02:32.367 --> 02:34.433
You're not doing her any favors.
- I can't keep lying

02:34.500 --> 02:36.467
to the people I love,
even if it means

02:36.533 --> 02:38.500
they're not gonna like me
very much anymore.

02:38.567 --> 02:40.967
- Sometimes lying
to the people you love best

02:41.067 --> 02:42.633
is the most loving
thing you can do.

02:42.700 --> 02:44.633
- You should like
a twisted fortune cookie.

02:44.700 --> 02:47.567
- I accept that.
[phone chimes]

02:47.633 --> 02:49.100
- I gotta get Kelsey
up for work.

02:49.167 --> 02:50.633
We're gonna be late
for the morning meeting.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.300
- Mmm.

02:52.367 --> 02:54.800
- Kelsey, we should
start thinking about

02:54.867 --> 02:56.433
heading to the office.

02:58.067 --> 02:59.767
Kelsey?

03:05.167 --> 03:07.567
[pop music]

03:07.633 --> 03:14.600
* *

03:30.367 --> 03:31.967
Good morning.
- Morning.

03:32.067 --> 03:33.867
[phone chimes]

03:36.767 --> 03:39.667
[rock music]

03:39.733 --> 03:46.667
* *

03:53.267 --> 03:54.733
- Oh, good, you're here.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.900
- Of course.
Where else would I be?

03:56.967 --> 03:58.967
- Well, you kinda
disappeared last night.

03:59.067 --> 04:01.067
I was worried about you.

04:01.100 --> 04:02.633
- What can I help you with?

04:02.700 --> 04:04.433
- Kelsey, we have to talk.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.233
I'm not gonna burden you
with this secret.

04:06.300 --> 04:08.367
- Right now,
I'm more concerned

04:08.433 --> 04:10.233
about how this happened.

04:10.300 --> 04:12.100
You bought that stupid
labradoodle book

04:12.167 --> 04:13.400
behind my back.

04:13.467 --> 04:14.700
- Emily Burns did some digging.

04:14.767 --> 04:16.233
She found out
about my real age,

04:16.300 --> 04:18.067
threatened to write
a story about me in "EW"

04:18.133 --> 04:20.067
unless we published her book.
- I begged you

04:20.133 --> 04:21.300
not to buy that book.
- I know.

04:21.367 --> 04:23.400
I was just
trying to protect--

04:23.467 --> 04:25.467
- Yourself.
- Oh, I'm so sorry

04:25.533 --> 04:27.267
to interrupt
your morning gossip,

04:27.333 --> 04:28.900
but Marylynne Keller, the famous
Washington spin doctor,

04:28.967 --> 04:31.067
is waiting for us
in the conference room

04:31.133 --> 04:32.800
to pitch her new book.
She has to leave in ten minutes

04:32.867 --> 04:35.367
to be on "Hardball" with
Chris Matthews, so let's move.

04:35.433 --> 04:37.133
- The title of my book--

04:37.200 --> 04:39.067
"It's True Because
I'm Shouting It:

04:39.133 --> 04:41.633
Confessions
of a Washington Spin Doctor."

04:41.700 --> 04:44.167
Because after 20 years
behind the scenes

04:44.233 --> 04:46.233
of shaping policy
and perception,

04:46.300 --> 04:48.300
I'm ready to take
a good, long leak.

04:48.367 --> 04:50.933
I'm ready to take you
through the stories

04:51.067 --> 04:53.567
of how I shaped the narrative,
from making people believe

04:53.633 --> 04:55.267
that George W. Bush
just loved to

04:55.333 --> 04:57.100
"clear brush on his ranch"

04:57.167 --> 04:59.167
to the universal perception
that Michelle Obama

04:59.233 --> 05:00.967
is a down-to-earth
fashion plate.

05:01.067 --> 05:03.333
- Well, isn't she?
- Well, if you think so,

05:03.400 --> 05:04.533
then it must be true.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.900
But how...did that happen?

05:06.967 --> 05:08.567
- Because she managed to be

05:08.633 --> 05:09.967
both down to earth
and glamorous?

05:10.067 --> 05:11.533
- And who would disagree
with you?

05:11.600 --> 05:13.667
Nobody.
You say something loud,

05:13.733 --> 05:16.433
you say it often,
then when people contradict you,

05:16.500 --> 05:18.367
they sound like
defensive babies.

05:18.433 --> 05:21.533
And bottom line: Truth...

05:21.600 --> 05:23.533
is a four-letter word.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.100
- Uh, actually, truth
is a five-letter word.

05:26.167 --> 05:28.167
- Not the way I spell it.

05:28.233 --> 05:30.667
It's important
not to confuse the truth

05:30.733 --> 05:32.767
with the facts,
and vice versa.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.900
- I'm not sure I...
see the difference.

05:34.967 --> 05:36.467
[laughs]
- Okay.

05:36.533 --> 05:38.467
The reality is a fact
is a factotum.

05:38.533 --> 05:40.167
And according to Webster's,

05:40.233 --> 05:42.567
a factotum
is a "jack of all trades,"

05:42.633 --> 05:45.300
certainly not something
to trust or rely on.

05:45.367 --> 05:48.767
- Those are two completely
different words.

05:48.833 --> 05:50.300
- You're a very
attractive woman.

05:50.367 --> 05:52.067
And I love that necklace.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.833
And I don't care
if you are transgender.

05:53.900 --> 05:56.333
- Uh--I'm not, um...

05:56.400 --> 05:57.867
- Either way, I don't care.

05:57.933 --> 06:00.233
The fact
of your gender identity

06:00.300 --> 06:02.533
is irrelevant to me.
- I'm a woman.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.533
- And I applaud that.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.367
- Marylynne, thank you
so much for meeting with us.

06:08.433 --> 06:10.700
- Oh, the pleasure
was mine.

06:13.567 --> 06:15.167
- Thank you. So much.
- Thank you.

06:15.233 --> 06:17.167
- Oh, you're welcome.

06:17.233 --> 06:18.767
Thank you.

06:18.833 --> 06:21.767
[light music]

06:21.833 --> 06:23.567
* *

06:23.633 --> 06:25.233
- Okay.

06:25.300 --> 06:27.733
I, uh, hear the opening
offer's 2 million.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.100
- Assuming we want it.

06:29.167 --> 06:30.300
- It's going to be

06:30.367 --> 06:31.633
a big title for someone.

06:31.700 --> 06:33.767
Thoughts?
- Very enlightening.

06:33.833 --> 06:35.533
- You can't be serious!

06:35.600 --> 06:38.333
She is a one-woman
reality distortion field!

06:40.233 --> 06:41.967
- Liza?

06:44.667 --> 06:48.767
- I think truth is more
elastic than we can imagine.

06:48.833 --> 06:51.233
But it still has value.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.733
Because without it,
there is no trust.

06:55.100 --> 06:57.267
And without trust...

06:57.333 --> 06:58.600
there is no love.

06:58.667 --> 07:01.233
And that is why
I have to confess

07:01.300 --> 07:03.767
something extremely difficult

07:03.833 --> 07:07.567
to a group of people that I have
come to love very much...

07:07.633 --> 07:10.067
and to whom I owe so much.

07:10.100 --> 07:13.433
And whose forgiveness
I wouldn't have the presumption

07:13.500 --> 07:15.500
to ask for.
- What? What is it?

07:15.567 --> 07:16.967
[suspenseful music]

07:17.067 --> 07:19.167
- I'm not--
- Going to marry...Josh.

07:19.233 --> 07:22.233
Josh...he proposed, and...

07:22.300 --> 07:25.067
Liza, I know
that this has been

07:25.100 --> 07:27.500
really hard for you.
- Oh, for God's sake.

07:27.567 --> 07:29.233
This is a business meeting!

07:29.300 --> 07:31.267
We do not discuss
our personal lives.

07:31.333 --> 07:33.167
I apologize for that, Charles.

07:33.233 --> 07:34.367
- It's fine.
- Liza...

07:34.433 --> 07:36.900
We need to talk.
- Uh...

07:36.967 --> 07:38.800
give us a moment first.

07:38.867 --> 07:45.867
* *

07:47.733 --> 07:49.133
Are you crazy?

07:49.200 --> 07:51.167
- No. Yes.
I don't know anymore.

07:51.233 --> 07:52.967
Probably.
- If you tell people

07:53.067 --> 07:55.433
that you've been lying
about your age,

07:55.500 --> 07:58.100
what do you think is going
to happen to Millennial?

07:58.167 --> 08:00.067
Our credibility
will be destroyed,

08:00.067 --> 08:01.867
and every hater out there

08:01.933 --> 08:03.900
who would just love to see us
fail will get their wish.

08:03.967 --> 08:05.733
- So I just keep lying?
- No.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.567
You...create your truth.

08:08.633 --> 08:10.533
I Googled you earlier,

08:10.600 --> 08:12.733
and the only thing
I could find...

08:12.800 --> 08:14.433
[chuckles]

08:14.500 --> 08:16.667
Was this.

08:16.733 --> 08:19.500
A prized pig in Iowa
named Liza Miller.

08:19.567 --> 08:20.967
- I actually hired someone

08:21.067 --> 08:22.633
to make myself invisible
online.

08:22.700 --> 08:24.533
- That's where you went wrong.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.400
You are who your last
ten search results say you are.

08:27.467 --> 08:29.067
We need to rewrite
your narrative,

08:29.067 --> 08:31.200
create
some alternative facts.

08:31.267 --> 08:33.833
- Oh, this is so sad.

08:33.900 --> 08:36.733
No Twitter, no Tumblr,
no Spotify playlists?

08:36.800 --> 08:38.767
- I've always been
a very private person.

08:38.833 --> 08:40.967
- Um, privacy is just another
word for low self-esteem,

08:41.067 --> 08:42.600
okay, Liza? You don't value
anything you say or do.

08:42.667 --> 08:44.400
That's why
you're still an assistant.

08:44.467 --> 08:47.167
- Okay, all right,
we're not here to criticize.

08:47.233 --> 08:49.233
We're here to help her...

08:49.300 --> 08:51.367
shout her truth.
- Mm-hmm. Of course.

08:51.433 --> 08:53.967
We need to build your social
media profile--that's what I do.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.467
When I first met Hector and
Dorff, they thought Instagram

08:56.533 --> 08:58.200
was something that
went up your nose, okay?

08:58.267 --> 09:00.600
Three million followers later,
well...

09:00.667 --> 09:02.733
- We need to give Liza
an online identity.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.767
All right?
It's important for Millennial

09:04.833 --> 09:07.100
that people have
a strong sense of who she is.

09:07.167 --> 09:09.167
- Okay.
So who do you wanna be?

09:09.233 --> 09:11.067
A bookworm
with a slutty streak?

09:11.100 --> 09:13.667
Workaholic hipster?
Ooh, I know, I know, I know!

09:13.733 --> 09:16.133
Maybe you're a feisty blonde who
doesn't call her friends back.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.400
Wait--No. That's Kelsey.

09:17.467 --> 09:19.067
- Lauren, I'm sorry.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.367
I had a rough week.

09:20.433 --> 09:21.600
- Oh...

09:21.667 --> 09:23.933
- Colin and I broke up.

09:24.067 --> 09:26.100
- Oh. Okay, wait--and you were
gonna tell me this when?

09:26.167 --> 09:27.933
- Soon.
- But you went to cry

09:28.067 --> 09:29.433
on Liza's shoulder?
- Actually, we've been crying

09:29.500 --> 09:30.933
on each other's shoulders.

09:31.067 --> 09:32.267
Josh and I broke up too.

09:32.333 --> 09:34.967
- Ah, I see, I see.
Okay, uh-huh.

09:35.067 --> 09:37.133
So you've both been bonding
over your mutual heartbreak,

09:37.200 --> 09:38.833
and you feel like you have
nothing in common

09:38.900 --> 09:40.367
with a happy person?
So, what--I'm odd woman out?

09:40.433 --> 09:42.067
- No, of course not.
- We love you.

09:42.133 --> 09:43.933
- You know, it's not like
my life is perfect, okay?

09:44.067 --> 09:46.367
Max works ridiculous shifts.
He comes home at crazy hours.

09:46.433 --> 09:49.300
There's not even time
for sex.

09:49.367 --> 09:50.567
- I'm sorry.
- Last night,

09:50.633 --> 09:52.100
I sat on his nocturnal erection

09:52.167 --> 09:53.733
while he was sleeping, okay?

09:53.800 --> 09:55.767
In some cultures,
that would be considered rape.

09:55.833 --> 09:58.067
- Yeah, pretty much
in every culture.

09:58.133 --> 09:59.533
- Whoops.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.600
[mellow music]

10:02.667 --> 10:08.800
* *

10:08.867 --> 10:10.833
- Liza.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.233
I certainly hope
that broken engagement

10:14.300 --> 10:16.233
had nothing to do with me.

10:17.800 --> 10:18.800
- No.

10:18.867 --> 10:20.967
When we got down to it,

10:21.033 --> 10:23.033
it wasn't what I wanted.

10:23.100 --> 10:26.567
And I'm really focused
on work right now.

10:26.633 --> 10:28.367
- That's important.

10:28.433 --> 10:30.667
- [laughs] Yeah.

10:30.733 --> 10:32.367
- Good night.

10:32.433 --> 10:34.600
- Good night.

10:34.667 --> 10:37.300
- Uh, L-Liza?

10:37.367 --> 10:39.133
Are you a Hemingway fan?

10:41.200 --> 10:43.533
- I, uh, love
"The Sun Also Rises"?

10:43.600 --> 10:45.433
Not so much
"The Old Man and the Sea,"

10:45.500 --> 10:48.533
but "A Moveable Feast"--pretty
much my bible in college.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.767
I still have dreams
of moving to Paris.

10:50.833 --> 10:52.467
- Would you like to join me
for something?

10:52.533 --> 10:55.067
I think you might
find this interesting.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.267
- Okay.

11:06.733 --> 11:10.167
[mellow music]

11:10.233 --> 11:12.433
- Hemingway's original draft

11:12.500 --> 11:14.467
of "Farewell to Arms"...
- [gasps]

11:14.533 --> 11:16.400
- With his handwritten notes.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.133
- Wow!

11:18.200 --> 11:19.900
- And, uh, that is

11:19.967 --> 11:22.267
the original
Three Mountains Press edition

11:22.333 --> 11:24.067
of his first collection
of short stories--

11:24.067 --> 11:26.333
published in Paris
in 1924.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.833
- "The Moveable Feast" years.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.833
Amazing!

11:29.900 --> 11:31.833
Are you thinking
of buying something?

11:31.900 --> 11:34.067
- Uh, no, I'm selling.

11:34.067 --> 11:36.100
- What?
All this belongs to you?

11:36.167 --> 11:39.433
- No, my parents.
My dad loved Hemingway.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.300
There's actually a picture
of the two of them somewhere

11:41.367 --> 11:43.133
together in Sun Valley.

11:43.200 --> 11:46.467
And I wanted to come by
and take one last look.

11:46.533 --> 11:48.133
- That must be tough.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.067
- Uh, not at all.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.167
This is...history,

11:52.233 --> 11:55.533
and I'm...more interested
in the future.

11:58.533 --> 12:00.100
- Wait--Hemingway wrote
love letters

12:00.167 --> 12:01.700
to Marlene Dietrich?

12:01.767 --> 12:05.400
- Yeah. That's the 1950s
version of sexting.

12:05.467 --> 12:06.667
- I never knew
they had a thing!

12:06.733 --> 12:09.067
- They didn't, exactly,
um...

12:09.067 --> 12:12.267
Hemingway once called
the two of them

12:12.333 --> 12:15.367
"victims
of unsynchronized passion."

12:15.433 --> 12:18.367

Old friends of my parents.

12:23.433 --> 12:30.300

12:32.133 --> 12:34.967
- This is the living room.
We split the cable bill.

12:35.067 --> 12:37.333
That's the kitchen.
There's always Kombucha brewing,

12:37.400 --> 12:38.967
so help yourself.
- Oh!

12:40.300 --> 12:41.833
- And the bedroom.

12:41.900 --> 12:44.100
- Oh...
[cats meows]

12:44.167 --> 12:47.433
My bedroom?
- No. It's a shared bed.

12:49.267 --> 12:52.200
We could...make
a pillow wall, if you want.

12:52.267 --> 12:55.100
- * I thought I could be
something special *

12:55.167 --> 12:57.867
* And cozy for you *

12:57.933 --> 13:00.300

13:00.367 --> 13:03.067
* A set of those diamonds *

13:03.133 --> 13:06.467
* The diamonds that glare
as you stare *

13:06.533 --> 13:09.800

13:09.867 --> 13:11.967
* You're so coo coo *

13:12.067 --> 13:14.200

13:14.267 --> 13:16.333
* You're so crazy *
- Josh!

13:16.400 --> 13:18.267
Hey!

13:18.333 --> 13:20.667
Hey. I saw you see me.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.900
- [sighs]

13:22.967 --> 13:25.300
Look, I'm sorry.
I just--

13:25.367 --> 13:27.300
I need to make a clean
break from Liza

13:27.367 --> 13:29.233
and her entire world,
okay?

13:29.300 --> 13:32.267
I mean, I'm sure you know
by now what's going on with us--

13:32.333 --> 13:33.633
- Josh.

13:33.700 --> 13:35.067
- Yeah.

13:35.133 --> 13:37.333
- I know everything.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.967
- You know everything?

13:40.367 --> 13:43.433
What do you think
you know?

13:43.500 --> 13:45.400
- Everything.

13:50.067 --> 13:51.900
[pop music plays]

13:51.967 --> 13:53.800
[Josh laughs]

13:53.867 --> 13:55.867
- Did you think
it was funny,

13:55.933 --> 13:58.300
both of you, just to pretend
to be my good friend and be

13:58.367 --> 14:00.733
just lying to me like that?
- No. No!

14:00.800 --> 14:04.500
I wanted to tell you, okay?
Lisa wouldn't let me.

14:04.567 --> 14:06.700
- God. Who is she?

14:06.767 --> 14:09.267
Like, do I even
know her at all?

14:09.333 --> 14:13.133
- It's like you know her...
and you don't.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.733
I mean, the same thing
happened to me, okay?

14:15.800 --> 14:17.367
- So what really
went on that night?

14:17.433 --> 14:19.500
When you were planning
to propose?

14:19.567 --> 14:21.600
- No, look, um...

14:21.667 --> 14:22.967
We can be friends.

14:23.067 --> 14:25.933
Don't ask me
about that night.

14:26.067 --> 14:29.100
Ever again.

14:32.267 --> 14:35.633
[electronic music]

14:35.700 --> 14:40.200

14:40.267 --> 14:42.700
[knock at door]
- Excuse me. Liza.

14:42.767 --> 14:44.967
Emily Burns
is in the conference room.

14:45.067 --> 14:46.900
- What? What is she doing here?
- I set it up.

14:46.967 --> 14:48.333
Shit's about to go down.

14:49.500 --> 14:50.833
- Excuse me?

14:50.900 --> 14:52.633
- Emily,
thanks for coming in.

14:52.700 --> 14:55.367
- Anytime. I am so excited
about my book!

14:55.433 --> 14:57.233
- That's what I wanted
to discuss with you.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.267
According to Liza,

14:59.333 --> 15:02.333
there was some kind of
blackmail involved?

15:02.400 --> 15:04.100
Now, I don't know
what it's about,

15:04.167 --> 15:06.467
nor do I care,
but I can assure you

15:06.533 --> 15:08.100
that once our lawyers
are done with you,

15:08.167 --> 15:10.233
you won't just be losing
a book deal.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.067
You'll be losing your job.
- I can't believe

15:12.067 --> 15:13.700
you're saying this
after that nice article

15:13.767 --> 15:15.133
I wrote about you guys
in "EW."

15:15.200 --> 15:17.667
- That article
was mostly about Colin,

15:17.733 --> 15:19.700
not Millennial.
- And thanks to the publicity

15:19.767 --> 15:21.900
the article generated, we're
not even publishing his book.

15:21.967 --> 15:24.067
- So thanks for nothing.

15:24.067 --> 15:25.767
Oh, if you wanna play dirty,

15:25.833 --> 15:28.167
the stakes are gonna
have to go way up.

15:28.233 --> 15:29.633
- What do you want?
- Well...

15:29.700 --> 15:31.900
Liza and I would like
to be on "EW's"

15:31.967 --> 15:33.667
29 under 29 Media List.

15:33.733 --> 15:36.100
- Both of us?
- Absolutely.

15:36.167 --> 15:38.767
- [laughs] Okay. That is crazy.
The party is tonight.

15:38.833 --> 15:40.800
That list has been closed
for weeks.

15:40.867 --> 15:42.300
- Unclose it.

15:42.367 --> 15:45.233
Or we're canceling
your book.

15:47.767 --> 15:51.167
- I guess you could tie
for 29th with Tavi Gevinson.

15:51.233 --> 15:53.233
- That would be fine.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.333
- You do realize
this is a press event.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.367
I just wanna make sure
you're both

15:57.433 --> 15:58.433
prepared to be photographed.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.700
- Absolutely.

16:00.767 --> 16:02.667
- Then see you tonight!

16:04.233 --> 16:07.067
And I hope you bitches
know what you're doing.

- [inhales, exhales]

16:12.833 --> 16:15.933
[dance music]

16:16.067 --> 16:18.067
- We really staked out
an important niche

16:18.067 --> 16:20.333
in the marketplace.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.600
- And of course, you can't run
a publishing company

16:23.667 --> 16:26.833
called Millennial unless
you're a Millennial yourself.

16:29.167 --> 16:35.633

16:36.667 --> 16:38.200
- Kelsey!
- Aah!

16:38.267 --> 16:39.733
- Oh, my God, Kelsey,
you look amazing!

16:39.800 --> 16:42.600
- Oh, thanks.
- God, I'm so impressed!

16:42.667 --> 16:44.267
Max has something
he wants to say to you.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.433
- Uh...we took the bench press
out of your room,

16:46.500 --> 16:48.067
and it's in the hallway now.
- Please come back.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.700
- Thank you, but no.

16:49.767 --> 16:51.133
It was time
for me to move out.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.633
- What--Where are you
living?

16:52.700 --> 16:54.300
- I'll let you know.

16:54.367 --> 16:55.800
Soon. I promise.

16:55.867 --> 16:57.200
- No. What's wrong
with right now?

16:57.267 --> 16:58.900
- Mm-mm. Boundaries.

16:58.967 --> 17:00.433
You wanna think of this
as an exercise.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.833
- Okay. Okay, fine.

17:02.900 --> 17:04.067
Never mind.
- Mm-hmm.

17:04.133 --> 17:05.833
- You look nice.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.400
- I've gotten so many
offers on the book.

17:09.467 --> 17:11.267
The tracking is incredible.

17:11.333 --> 17:13.267
It already has more preorders
than the last "Harry Potter."

17:13.333 --> 17:15.867
- How is that possible?
You don't have a publisher yet.

17:15.933 --> 17:17.533
- Well, I can't do the math
for you.

17:17.600 --> 17:21.067
The point is, Empirical's offer
was not the best.

17:21.133 --> 17:22.833
But I do feel comfortable
with you.

17:22.900 --> 17:24.767
- Well, and...we will have
a-a great team

17:24.833 --> 17:26.300
working for you.

17:26.367 --> 17:28.267
- Did you hear about
the rumors on "Politico"

17:28.333 --> 17:29.900
that we're having an affair?
It's so weird.

17:29.967 --> 17:32.867
- Really?
Uh, t-that is strange.

17:32.933 --> 17:34.433
- We should just go ahead
and do it

17:34.500 --> 17:36.300
and prove the naysayers
wrong.

17:36.367 --> 17:39.167
- Wouldn't that be...
proving them right?

17:39.233 --> 17:40.600
- I'm talking about
the trolls out there

17:40.667 --> 17:42.167
who are saying
it isn't true.

17:42.233 --> 17:43.900
Oh, by the way,
according to my Twitter feed,

17:43.967 --> 17:47.267
it says that I'm at
a conference in Beijing.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.133
So it's the perfect cover.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.133

17:51.200 --> 17:53.267
how are you tweeting
from Beijing?

17:53.333 --> 17:54.700
- Oh, I have people.
It's important to maintain

17:54.767 --> 17:56.300
a Chinese presence.

17:56.367 --> 17:59.500
- It would be great
if we could, uh...

17:59.567 --> 18:01.400
confine our conversation
to the book.

18:01.467 --> 18:03.167
- And kissing.

18:03.233 --> 18:05.167
- Uh...no.

18:05.233 --> 18:07.200
- Oh, I'm hearing yes.

18:07.267 --> 18:09.967
- Uh, no, I'm...
I'm saying no.

18:10.067 --> 18:12.300
- Words.
You're just saying words.

18:22.067 --> 18:25.200
- Okay, you are an evil genius.

18:25.267 --> 18:28.233
You just got "EW" to put
their reputation on the line.

18:28.300 --> 18:31.233
They would rather die
than admit they were wrong.

18:31.300 --> 18:32.900
- Wrong about what?

18:32.967 --> 18:36.767
- Nothing.
We're all in this together now.

18:36.833 --> 18:40.667
Hey...
Isn't that your DILF boss?

18:42.067 --> 18:45.233
- Oh, um, excuse me.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.433
Hey.
- Hi.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.533
- I thought you had
your dinner tonight.

18:49.600 --> 18:54.067
- Uh, I did; I wanted to
congratulate you on the honor.

18:54.100 --> 18:57.867
Uh, though I feel like I'm
the oldest person in the room.

18:57.933 --> 19:00.700
Are you sure I'm allowed
to be here if I'm over 29?

19:00.767 --> 19:02.800
- [stammering]

19:02.867 --> 19:04.933
Uh, so, did we get the book?

19:05.067 --> 19:08.267
- Uh, no, because I don't
want to publish it.

19:08.333 --> 19:10.233
- Why not?
- I don't want to contribute to

19:10.300 --> 19:15.067
the idea that truth is whatever
you're comfortable with.

19:15.133 --> 19:18.067
Even if it means taking
a hit to the bottom line.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.567
- Right.

19:19.633 --> 19:22.833
- Guess I'm just old-fashioned
that way.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.100
- Hey, uh, do you mind
if I steal her?

19:24.167 --> 19:25.500
"Vulture" has a few questions.

19:25.567 --> 19:28.100
- Uh, no, no, go, go.
Have fun.
