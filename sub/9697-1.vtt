Huh?

02:25.500 --> 02:27.330
Huh? My shoe?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.050
You dropped this.

02:30.060 --> 02:33.550
More like it flew.

02:45.020 --> 02:46.980
He looks popular...

02:47.900 --> 02:48.650

02:48.650 --> 02:49.130
Ah! Did I say something?
Huh?

02:49.130 --> 02:51.190

02:51.190 --> 02:55.130

Stop saying unnecessary things.

02:56.930 --> 02:56.950
Ugly?
Stop saying unnecessary things.

02:56.950 --> 02:57.200
Stop saying unnecessary things.
Ugly?

02:57.200 --> 02:58.410
Ugly?

02:58.410 --> 03:00.330
Don't worry about it.

03:02.910 --> 03:05.960
Thank you for picking up my shoe.

03:07.250 --> 03:10.790
Why? Why are you runnig away Haruna?

03:10.790 --> 03:13.960
What did she say just now Yoh?

03:30.250 --> 03:31.380
Mami-chan...

03:31.380 --> 03:31.980
Huh?
Mami-chan...

03:31.980 --> 03:32.360
Huh?

03:32.360 --> 03:34.730
It was another failure.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.030
No one chatted you up?

03:39.030 --> 03:41.480
There was one guy.

03:41.480 --> 03:42.660
How was he?

03:43.090 --> 03:44.290
He ran away.

03:44.410 --> 03:47.120
He ranaway? Why?

03:48.540 --> 03:49.710
This girl's fast!

03:49.710 --> 03:50.790
Wait!

03:51.380 --> 03:52.920
I have no idea.

03:52.920 --> 03:54.670
Absolutely no idea.

03:55.260 --> 03:58.010
I've been reading magazines and watching TV

03:58.010 --> 04:00.990
and I said I'm aiming to be really popular among guys right?

04:00.990 --> 04:01.010
I guess there is a limit to self-study huh?

I guess there is a limit to self-study huh?

04:06.560 --> 04:08.640
See it's the same for softball right?

04:08.640 --> 04:11.980
If you don't have a good supervisor or a good coach the team won't be good right?

04:11.980 --> 04:12.980
Yeah!

04:12.980 --> 04:17.399
That's why you need a coach!

04:17.399 --> 04:20.910
Why don't you find a coach who can teach you how to attract men?

04:21.620 --> 04:23.240
That's right!

04:23.240 --> 04:27.660
There were times when I just realized it after the coach told me what I didn't know!

04:27.660 --> 04:29.890
Mami-chan! Please be my coach!

04:29.890 --> 04:29.920
No no no!
Mami-chan! Please be my coach!

04:29.920 --> 04:31.230
Mami-chan! Please be my coach!
No no no!

04:31.230 --> 04:31.250
Mami-chan! Please be my coach!

04:31.250 --> 04:35.380
It's better that you find someone who knows how guys think.

04:35.960 --> 04:39.510
Even so... I have no idea who it should be.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.510
Me neither...

04:42.640 --> 04:43.600
You dropped your shoe.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.930
More like it flew.

04:46.310 --> 04:47.930
There's one person!

04:48.520 --> 04:51.140
But it's someone I met by chance in town.

04:51.140 --> 04:52.900
I'm not gonna meet him again.

04:54.610 --> 04:56.190
Aaah!

05:01.280 --> 05:02.130
I found him!

05:02.130 --> 05:02.160
Huh?
I found him!

05:02.160 --> 05:02.930
I found him!
Huh?

05:02.930 --> 05:02.950
I found him!

05:11.250 --> 05:12.420
I'll ask him!

05:12.870 --> 05:15.840
Wait a minute! You don't know him right?

05:15.840 --> 05:17.750
You can't ask him that!

05:18.710 --> 05:21.590
No! This is the only way l can think of!

05:21.930 --> 05:24.340
Wait! Haruna!

05:24.340 --> 05:26.180
Just like in softball opportunities don't come often!
Wait! Haruna!

05:26.180 --> 05:27.060
Just like in softball opportunities don't come often!

05:27.060 --> 05:28.640
It has to be now!

05:30.600 --> 05:31.850
I'm sorry!

05:33.230 --> 05:34.900
Excuse me!

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
Do you remember me? You picked up my ugly shoe.

05:57.750 --> 05:58.460
Ah.

05:58.460 --> 05:58.730
My name is Nagashima Haruna. 1st year student.
Ah.

05:58.730 --> 06:02.920

06:02.920 --> 06:05.930
Please...

06:05.930 --> 06:08.810
Please tell me how to be a popular girl!

06:08.810 --> 06:10.930
Please be my coach!

06:10.930 --> 06:15.190
What? What is that? Popularity coach? Sounds fun!

06:15.190 --> 06:16.730
Why don't you do it Onii-chan?

06:16.730 --> 06:18.730
No way. It's troublesome.

06:18.730 --> 06:20.800
This type of girl who wants to make a high school debut.

06:20.800 --> 06:20.820
Huh?
This type of girl who wants to make a high school debut.

06:20.820 --> 06:21.880

06:21.900 --> 06:25.160
Exactly! How did you know?

06:25.160 --> 06:28.990
Hairstyle makeup ribbon uniform.

06:28.990 --> 06:30.990
They don't go well together at all.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.000
Please!

06:33.000 --> 06:34.960
Please teach me things like that!

06:34.960 --> 06:36.960
Absolutely not.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.960
Why not?

06:40.250 --> 06:41.920
Girls are troublesome.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.300
Huh?

06:43.300 --> 06:45.930
You decide on your own what you like or not.

06:45.930 --> 06:48.090
You distrust easily.

06:48.090 --> 06:49.930
Things like that.

06:53.140 --> 06:58.060
Even if you don't have a coach you're... not gonna be popular huh?

06:58.060 --> 06:59.980
Well good luck!

07:03.900 --> 07:06.150
OK next! Nagashima Haruna!

07:06.150 --> 07:06.910
Hmph!

Only 70% strength huh?

07:17.420 --> 07:19.000
Only 70% strength huh?

07:25.630 --> 07:28.890
I'm sorry my brother said those mean things to you before.

07:28.890 --> 07:31.180
It's the truth though...

07:31.180 --> 07:35.890
It's true that he is popular but things happened.

07:35.890 --> 07:39.480
He can't trust women anymore.

07:39.480 --> 07:41.940
He thinks they're enemies.

07:41.940 --> 07:43.940
How sad...

07:44.440 --> 07:46.320
I'm Komiyama Asami.

07:46.320 --> 07:48.570
My brother's Komiyama Yoh.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.490
Yoh...

07:50.490 --> 07:53.160
Ah I'm Nagashima Haruna.

07:53.160 --> 07:56.540
I know. You were amazing in softball!

07:56.580 --> 07:58.540
Thanks...

07:58.540 --> 08:04.300
During junior high you always played softball and you were always in jerseys so you have no fashion sense huh?

08:04.800 --> 08:09.910
It's shocking how she can say such mean things with a cute face and what's more they're all true!

08:09.910 --> 08:09.930
As an apology I'll lend you my clothes.
It's shocking how she can say such mean things with a cute face and what's more they're all true!

08:11.050 --> 08:13.930
As an apology I'll lend you my clothes.

08:14.220 --> 08:16.600
When I wore that last time I got hit on.

08:16.600 --> 08:17.730
Seriously?

08:17.730 --> 08:21.630
Ah but that's just because Asami-chan has the looks...

08:21.630 --> 08:21.650
You can call me Asami.
Ah but that's just because Asami-chan has the looks...

08:21.650 --> 08:22.610
Ah but that's just because Asami-chan has the looks...
You can call me Asami.

08:22.610 --> 08:23.320
You can call me Asami.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.480
Anyway do you want to come to my house today?

08:25.480 --> 08:26.280
Huh?

08:26.280 --> 08:27.860
I want to go!

08:32.909 --> 08:36.490
It suits you Haruna! You'll definitely get hit on!

08:36.950 --> 08:37.679
Really?

08:37.679 --> 08:37.700
Yeah! You're cute really!
Really?

08:37.700 --> 08:37.950
Really?
Yeah! You're cute really!

08:37.950 --> 08:39.710
Yeah! You're cute really!

08:40.919 --> 08:42.919
Ah! Onii-chan!

08:43.539 --> 08:46.300
Look at this! Doesn't Haruka look cute?

08:47.460 --> 08:49.420
We've become friends.

08:49.840 --> 08:50.970
Oh really?

08:50.970 --> 08:54.680
We've brought back your favorite takoyaki.

08:55.970 --> 08:58.160
I want you to be my coach!

08:58.160 --> 08:58.180
I'm not gonna be your coach.
I want you to be my coach!

08:58.180 --> 08:58.730
I want you to be my coach!
I'm not gonna be your coach.

08:58.730 --> 08:59.270
I'm not gonna be your coach.

08:59.270 --> 08:59.660
How did you?
I'm not gonna be your coach.

08:59.660 --> 09:00.940
How did you?

09:10.650 --> 09:13.240
Then in exchange for one takoyaki...

09:14.740 --> 09:18.040
The shape of sleeves is wrong it emphasizes your muscles.

09:18.450 --> 09:20.620
Your hairstyle doesn't match the dress.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.580
Asami and you have different body shapes.

09:24.460 --> 09:25.920
And then...

09:27.960 --> 09:29.670
Forget it.

09:30.010 --> 09:31.260
What is it?

09:31.260 --> 09:32.930
Tell me all of it!

09:32.930 --> 09:35.540
Why do you want to be popular so much?

09:35.830 --> 09:39.930
That's because... I want to find a boyfriend!

09:39.930 --> 09:41.250
What do you want?

09:41.250 --> 09:42.640
What kind of guy?

09:42.640 --> 09:44.900
I haven't thought of it that much...

09:46.520 --> 09:51.780
A relationship... is not all roses.

09:52.320 --> 09:53.450
Huh?

09:59.540 --> 10:00.910
Yoh-san!

10:01.450 --> 10:04.040
I know a relationship is not all roses.

10:04.040 --> 10:07.500
There will be difficult times and crying too.

10:07.500 --> 10:12.140
But I think if you do your best you won't regret it.

10:12.140 --> 10:14.800
That's why I want to give it a try with all I've got!

10:17.470 --> 10:18.970
I see.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.930
Then do your best.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.740

10:55.400 --> 11:02.910
It's true... if you do your best... your dream will come true and you'll win!

11:05.460 --> 11:08.980
We won! Mami-chan!

11:08.980 --> 11:09.750
Her face is all soppy!
We won! Mami-chan!

11:09.750 --> 11:11.820

11:33.050 --> 11:34.920
I don't understand.

11:34.920 --> 11:37.930
I don't understand what I should do.

11:38.680 --> 11:43.520
I want to do my best but... I don't understand.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.930
You have too much perfume on.

11:51.690 --> 11:53.190
An angel!

11:53.190 --> 11:55.690
Your hat tries too hard.

11:55.690 --> 11:58.990
Too many things on your neck it's too loud.

11:59.570 --> 12:01.200
Yoh-san.

12:05.620 --> 12:09.120
You put too much enthusiasm no one dares to come near you.

12:10.210 --> 12:14.920
Are you... going to... coach me?

12:15.380 --> 12:16.670
Yeah.

12:17.090 --> 12:19.220
But under one condition.

12:21.140 --> 12:24.140
Don't ever fall in love with me.

12:24.430 --> 12:26.930
If you do I'll stop being your coach.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.370
Yes! All right! I won't fall in love!

12:30.370 --> 12:30.400
Absolutely not.
Yes! All right! I won't fall in love!

12:30.400 --> 12:30.810
Yes! All right! I won't fall in love!
Absolutely not.

12:30.810 --> 12:32.130
Absolutely not.

12:32.130 --> 12:33.920
Absolutely not!

12:37.940 --> 12:41.320
You... your face is average but you have a nice smile.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.300
You should make it your selling point.

12:43.300 --> 12:44.870
Huh?

12:45.700 --> 12:47.950
You can call me Yoh.

12:47.950 --> 12:49.540
Yes Coach!

12:49.540 --> 12:50.670
I said you can call me Yoh!

12:50.670 --> 12:51.920
Yes!

12:52.920 --> 12:54.170
Don't fall in love with me.

12:54.590 --> 12:57.670
I won't I won't! Never!

12:58.210 --> 12:59.760
All right!

13:05.970 --> 13:09.230
Starting tomorrow I'm going to be popular.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.650
It's gonna be tough...

13:15.000 --> 13:15.920
LET'S LEARN ABOUT POPULAR CLOTHES

13:15.920 --> 13:20.190
Popularity Lesson 1
LET'S LEARN ABOUT POPULAR CLOTHES

13:20.400 --> 13:22.280
All right!

13:25.240 --> 13:28.500
I've thought about the fundamental reasons why you've been unsuccessful.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.620
Yes! What is it?

13:30.620 --> 13:34.250
First of all these days no one finds a boyfriend from getting hit on in town.

13:34.250 --> 13:35.570
What?

13:35.570 --> 13:37.050
But... but!!!

13:38.420 --> 13:40.470
See? Spots to be hit on!

13:40.470 --> 13:42.470
What is this?

13:45.430 --> 13:47.890
It's my study notes on how to attract men.

13:47.890 --> 13:50.980
I learned them from reading female magazines and girls comics.

13:50.980 --> 13:54.900
Things like what stylish clothes to wear and what goes well with them.

13:55.770 --> 13:57.150
I see.

14:00.150 --> 14:01.400
Nooooooo!

14:01.950 --> 14:04.910
I'm telling you that's what's fundamentally wrong with you!

14:04.910 --> 14:05.910
What?

14:06.240 --> 14:10.080
Mixing cola orange juice and oolong tea together tastes disgusting right?

14:11.080 --> 14:14.920
You don't have to imagine it! It's definitely disgusting!

14:14.920 --> 14:15.960
Yes.

14:17.500 --> 14:20.280
In any case I thought today I would find a skirt that'll suit you.

14:20.280 --> 14:20.300
A skirt?!
In any case I thought today I would find a skirt that'll suit you.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.260
In any case I thought today I would find a skirt that'll suit you.
A skirt?!

14:21.260 --> 14:21.880
A skirt?!

14:21.880 --> 14:23.130
I'm so happy!

14:23.130 --> 14:25.720
During junior high all I wore were jerseys!

14:25.720 --> 14:27.580
I want Yoh-san to pick a skirt that'll look good on me!

14:27.580 --> 14:27.600
I told you to call me Yoh.
I want Yoh-san to pick a skirt that'll look good on me!

14:27.600 --> 14:28.350
I want Yoh-san to pick a skirt that'll look good on me!
I told you to call me Yoh.

14:28.350 --> 14:29.100
I told you to call me Yoh.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.640
Your bag.

14:39.770 --> 14:41.190
I see.

14:41.530 --> 14:45.780
If I wear the clothes Yoh picks for me I'll look stylish.

14:47.870 --> 14:50.040
Um are you alone?

14:50.040 --> 14:51.950
Not really.

14:51.950 --> 14:52.890
Are you looking for something?

14:52.890 --> 14:52.910
Amazing. I took my eyes off him for a second and suddenly he's being hit on by all these girls!
Are you looking for something?

14:52.910 --> 14:53.370
Are you looking for something?
Amazing. I took my eyes off him for a second and suddenly he's being hit on by all these girls!

14:53.370 --> 14:57.790
Amazing. I took my eyes off him for a second and suddenly he's being hit on by all these girls!

14:57.790 --> 14:59.170
Hey...

14:59.170 --> 15:01.590
Try this on.

15:04.630 --> 15:07.260
Too many judges!

15:08.890 --> 15:09.890
Well?

15:35.330 --> 15:37.580
I'm so sorry!

15:37.580 --> 15:40.340
I don't look good in a skirt!

15:41.040 --> 15:43.670
You don't have to apologize.

15:45.220 --> 15:48.970
Oh no! This is getting awkward!

15:48.970 --> 15:52.030
I have to say something! I have to do a comedic gag!

15:52.030 --> 15:52.060
You don't have to do a gag.
I have to say something! I have to do a comedic gag!

15:52.060 --> 15:52.810
I have to say something! I have to do a comedic gag!
You don't have to do a gag.

15:52.810 --> 15:53.390
You don't have to do a gag.

15:53.390 --> 15:53.870
What?
You don't have to do a gag.

15:53.870 --> 15:54.680
What?

15:54.680 --> 15:56.980
How did you know?

15:57.020 --> 16:00.150
The way you think is always so transparent.

16:00.150 --> 16:02.940
I'm transparent?

16:03.610 --> 16:05.900
By the way what kind of gag were you thinking of doing?

16:06.990 --> 16:09.320
I'm sorry.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.330
I'm sorry.

16:26.210 --> 16:29.430
Basically male clothing suits you huh?

16:29.880 --> 16:31.930
Oh yeah...

16:38.270 --> 16:40.560
This is cute!

16:41.060 --> 16:43.610
You can't have that! I'm throwing it away.

16:45.820 --> 16:48.240
It won't suit you anyway.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.410
In any case put these on.

17:00.290 --> 17:01.960
I'm done.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.130
Well?

17:12.050 --> 17:15.910
I guess it's these huh?

17:15.910 --> 17:15.930
No these are not! It's true that these kind of clothes suit you.
I guess it's these huh?

17:15.930 --> 17:16.510
Yes these are great!
No these are not! It's true that these kind of clothes suit you.

17:16.510 --> 17:20.440
No these are not! It's true that these kind of clothes suit you.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.980
It looks effortless and your arms and legs are totally hidden.

17:23.980 --> 17:26.690
But it's absolutely the wrong thing to attract men.

17:26.690 --> 17:29.570
It's okay it's okay. These are great!

17:29.570 --> 17:31.610
If you say these are fine then these are fine!

17:31.610 --> 17:32.970
They're not!
If you say these are fine then these are fine!

17:32.970 --> 17:32.990
They're not!

17:32.990 --> 17:35.100
There must be female clothes that suit you.

17:35.100 --> 17:35.120
It's okay!
There must be female clothes that suit you.

17:35.120 --> 17:35.910
There must be female clothes that suit you.
It's okay!

17:35.910 --> 17:36.180
It's okay!

17:36.180 --> 17:36.200
It's not!
It's okay!

17:36.200 --> 17:37.720
It's okay!
It's not!

17:37.720 --> 17:37.740
It's not!

17:37.740 --> 17:40.750
So Yoh is really doing it!

17:43.460 --> 17:44.400
Why are you guys here?

17:44.400 --> 17:44.420
Well we heard Yoh is coaching now.
Why are you guys here?

17:44.420 --> 17:44.920
Why are you guys here?
Well we heard Yoh is coaching now.

17:44.920 --> 17:47.920
Well we heard Yoh is coaching now.

17:47.920 --> 17:48.480
We thought it sounds interesting.
Well we heard Yoh is coaching now.

17:48.480 --> 17:49.900
We thought it sounds interesting.

17:49.900 --> 17:49.920
Ah! You're the one from last time.
We thought it sounds interesting.

17:49.920 --> 17:50.630
We thought it sounds interesting.
Ah! You're the one from last time.

17:50.630 --> 17:52.300
Ah! You're the one from last time.

17:52.300 --> 17:55.660
Let me introduce myself I'm Yoh's friend Tamura Fumiya.

17:55.660 --> 17:56.330
I'm Asaoka.

17:56.330 --> 17:56.970
Right? She's cute right?
I'm Asaoka.

17:56.970 --> 17:57.740
Right? She's cute right?

17:57.740 --> 17:57.760
Yeah. She's definitely cuter than I thought.
Right? She's cute right?

17:57.760 --> 17:58.430
Right? She's cute right?
Yeah. She's definitely cuter than I thought.

17:58.430 --> 18:01.370
Yeah. She's definitely cuter than I thought.

18:01.370 --> 18:01.390
What?
Yeah. She's definitely cuter than I thought.

18:01.390 --> 18:02.190
Yeah. She's definitely cuter than I thought.
What?

18:02.190 --> 18:02.940
What?

18:02.940 --> 18:04.600
Don't listen to what he says it's all just empty flattery!

18:04.600 --> 18:05.540
I see.

18:05.540 --> 18:05.560
No you're really cute! You're my type!
I see.

18:05.560 --> 18:06.770
I see.
No you're really cute! You're my type!

18:06.770 --> 18:07.190
No you're really cute! You're my type!

18:07.190 --> 18:07.630
What?
No you're really cute! You're my type!

18:07.630 --> 18:08.170
What?

18:08.170 --> 18:08.190
He says that to everyone.
What?

18:08.190 --> 18:08.780
What?
He says that to everyone.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.000
He says that to everyone.

18:10.000 --> 18:10.610
You're Watching 123Movies.to
He says that to everyone.

18:10.610 --> 18:10.940
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:10.940 --> 18:14.930

18:14.930 --> 18:15.910
Just small talk huh?
Ah so tiring. Please don't say anything else. All this empty flattery...
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:15.910 --> 18:16.990
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:16.990 --> 18:19.910

You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:22.000 --> 18:22.910
Asami-chan you're such a good cook!

18:22.910 --> 18:23.960
It's seriously delicious!

18:23.960 --> 18:25.500
Why are you all even having dinner here?

18:25.500 --> 18:28.800
Asami-chan dresses so stylishly and can cook so well.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.130
You're the true example of a popular girl!

18:31.550 --> 18:35.640
Their parents live abroad so Asami-chan is like Yoh's mom.

18:35.930 --> 18:37.930
Right Yoh?

18:37.930 --> 18:39.760
Right Onii-chan?

18:41.640 --> 18:43.730
Stop it all of you.

18:43.730 --> 18:48.270
You wait here. I'll draw a sketch.

18:51.230 --> 18:53.300
Huh? A sketch?

18:53.300 --> 18:53.320
For clothes.
Huh? A sketch?

18:53.320 --> 18:53.900
Huh? A sketch?
For clothes.

18:53.900 --> 18:54.490
For clothes.

18:54.490 --> 18:56.200
It's great isn't it Haruna-chan?

18:56.200 --> 18:57.430
Yoh seems to be serious about it.

18:57.430 --> 18:57.450
Yes!
Yoh seems to be serious about it.

18:57.450 --> 18:58.200
Yoh seems to be serious about it.
Yes!

18:58.200 --> 18:58.910
Yes!

18:58.910 --> 19:01.450
I want to be popular like Asami-chan!

19:01.450 --> 19:02.020
I'll do my best!

19:02.020 --> 19:02.040
Please do your best Haruna-chan!
I'll do my best!

19:02.040 --> 19:02.620
I'll do my best!
Please do your best Haruna-chan!

19:02.620 --> 19:03.960
Please do your best Haruna-chan!

19:04.540 --> 19:09.270
But Fumiya-san and Asaoka-san you two look popular too...

19:09.270 --> 19:09.290
No no. Compared to Yoh we're not at all!
But Fumiya-san and Asaoka-san you two look popular too...

19:09.290 --> 19:10.130
But Fumiya-san and Asaoka-san you two look popular too...
No no. Compared to Yoh we're not at all!

19:10.130 --> 19:12.920
No no. Compared to Yoh we're not at all!

19:13.130 --> 19:14.740
I knew he was popular!

19:14.740 --> 19:14.760
When he was in elementary school he went home carrying chocolates in a 70-liter trash bag.
I knew he was popular!

19:14.760 --> 19:15.470
I knew he was popular!
When he was in elementary school he went home carrying chocolates in a 70-liter trash bag.

19:15.470 --> 19:19.510
When he was in elementary school he went home carrying chocolates in a 70-liter trash bag.

19:19.510 --> 19:22.810
But when you're too popular you might get wrongfully resented too.

19:23.020 --> 19:23.370
Huh?

19:23.370 --> 19:23.390
The girls in his class were divided fighting over him the losers would give him hate letters in his shoebox.
Huh?

19:23.390 --> 19:24.480
Huh?
The girls in his class were divided fighting over him the losers would give him hate letters in his shoebox.

19:24.480 --> 19:29.980
The girls in his class were divided fighting over him the losers would give him hate letters in his shoebox.

19:29.980 --> 19:31.500
Yes yes there was that beads incident too right?

19:31.500 --> 19:31.520
That's a taboo word right?
Yes yes there was that beads incident too right?

19:31.520 --> 19:32.570
Yes yes there was that beads incident too right?
That's a taboo word right?

19:32.570 --> 19:33.940
That's a taboo word right?

19:33.940 --> 19:35.450
That's right. Sorry.

19:35.450 --> 19:41.450
You see when he was in the junior high school's basketball club he dated the club's manager.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.540
You've been working hard.

19:49.540 --> 19:51.130
Thanks.

19:51.290 --> 19:55.550
But the other manager who also liked Onii-chan found out about it.

19:55.920 --> 20:00.930
That girl wanted to steal him away so she lied to the girl he was dating.

20:00.930 --> 20:02.220
What lie?

20:02.220 --> 20:04.560
I'm dating Yoh!

20:09.770 --> 20:11.360
That's so low!

20:11.360 --> 20:14.940
But the girl he was dating thought that lie was true.

20:14.940 --> 20:18.410
She broke up with him.

20:18.910 --> 20:20.870
I can't trust you!

20:23.950 --> 20:27.580
She asked the other club members for advice about it.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.090
Two-timers are scums!

20:40.090 --> 20:42.930
You think popular guys can do whatever they want huh?

20:43.140 --> 20:47.810
They were expected to win the championship but they lost in one game.

21:02.200 --> 21:10.120
The girl he was dating had made a beads bracelet and had given him one.

21:12.130 --> 21:15.920
That's why we call it the "beads incident".

21:16.420 --> 21:18.010
You can't have that!

21:18.630 --> 21:20.260
'Cause I'm gonna throw it away.

21:20.510 --> 21:26.930
The girl he dated decided on her own to break up with him but he loved her.

21:26.930 --> 21:30.940
Since then he has developed a distrust for women.

21:31.980 --> 21:36.520
A relationship... is not all roses.

21:37.030 --> 21:43.110
That's why we were really surprised to hear he agreed to be your coach!

21:43.870 --> 21:45.910
Huh?

21:46.870 --> 21:48.450
You guys are not saying unnecessary things right?

21:48.450 --> 21:48.600
No no. We're not we're not!
You guys are not saying unnecessary things right?

21:48.600 --> 21:48.790
No no. We're not we're not!

21:48.790 --> 21:50.680
We're not.
No no. We're not we're not!

21:50.680 --> 21:50.710

32:25.220 --> 32:27.510
Even though he just spent the day with me!

32:27.510 --> 32:30.890
Even though I thought this could be the start of love!

32:32.470 --> 32:35.890
We're gonna start dating!

33:00.630 --> 33:03.340
Didn't I tell you to not misunderstand?

33:04.550 --> 33:05.960
Mhm.

33:08.430 --> 33:12.970
Did you fall for Fumi?

33:14.390 --> 33:16.520
I don't know.

33:18.310 --> 33:27.780
But... love is very different from your ideal imagination and in reality different from person to person right?

33:30.010 --> 33:34.910
I just... feel sad.

33:41.210 --> 33:42.920
It's okay to cry.

33:45.050 --> 33:49.470
At times like this it's okay to cry.

34:00.020 --> 34:02.600
I'll definitely find you a good guy.

34:24.130 --> 34:27.960
But I'm not going to give up!

34:28.840 --> 34:33.219
I'm going to do my best so I'll be happier next time!

34:39.810 --> 34:44.440
Next Saturday let's go shopping together.

34:44.900 --> 34:46.940
Yoh...

35:03.000 --> 35:04.400
Fumi-kun say "aaah~"

35:04.400 --> 35:04.420

35:10.090 --> 35:13.090
So love has this kind of power!

35:14.720 --> 35:15.820
Do you want to go somewhere else?

35:15.820 --> 35:15.840

35:19.560 --> 35:21.730
I'm learning just by watching them.

35:21.730 --> 35:24.060
Like Asami's gestures for instance.

35:24.440 --> 35:25.900
Eh-heh!

35:25.900 --> 35:26.650
Creepy.

35:26.650 --> 35:29.480

40:34.500 --> 40:37.080

I think you have your own strengths.

40:55.390 --> 40:56.520

42:46.920 --> 42:48.550
Is that something to understand?

42:48.550 --> 42:52.470
But Onii-chan rejected all of them huh?

42:58.600 --> 43:00.520
Morning!

43:09.610 --> 43:13.360
I feel like I've seen her somewhere.

43:19.490 --> 43:23.920
After school. I'll wait at the gym's storeroom. Yoh.

43:24.460 --> 43:27.600
I see. Date practice.

43:27.650 --> 43:30.170
I'll give it my all!

43:42.230 --> 43:44.480
Yoh what's wrong?

43:45.100 --> 43:47.940
I might have a cold.

43:48.900 --> 43:52.400
Then what do you want to talk about?

43:52.570 --> 43:55.530
Huh? It's you who wanted to talk right?

44:00.080 --> 44:01.620
What was that sound?

44:01.620 --> 44:03.410
Is this a trap?

44:06.170 --> 44:07.620
It won't open!

44:07.620 --> 44:09.170
Mobile phone!

44:09.170 --> 44:11.700
There's no signal we can't send anything.

44:11.840 --> 44:14.970
Then we can't get out until someone comes?

44:15.630 --> 44:18.640
I... guess.

44:36.150 --> 44:41.030
Right now the two of us... will just die a natural death right?

44:44.620 --> 44:48.400
Someone! Is someone there?

44:48.400 --> 44:48.420
So cold.
Someone! Is someone there?

44:48.420 --> 44:48.960
Someone! Is someone there?
So cold.

44:48.960 --> 44:49.920
So cold.

44:49.920 --> 44:54.040
Cold? Cold? Cold? Cold...

44:54.130 --> 44:57.720
Yoh wear this. I'll be fine.

44:57.720 --> 44:59.090
No.

44:59.090 --> 45:01.720
There must be something else to put on.

45:01.720 --> 45:04.470
Ah! Volleyball net!

45:04.470 --> 45:06.010
There's no point huh?

45:06.050 --> 45:08.050
Gymnastics mattress!

45:08.370 --> 45:10.940
It's cold to the touch!

45:11.360 --> 45:13.900
I found a blanket! A blanket!

45:15.110 --> 45:18.280
Yoh just put this on.

45:18.700 --> 45:20.090
What about you?

45:20.090 --> 45:23.200
I'll be fine. I'm hot-blooded!

45:24.290 --> 45:30.880
In situations like this there must be a door. Something we could slip out from.

45:31.920 --> 45:33.250
Wait!

45:33.840 --> 45:35.210
I can hear the wind!

45:35.210 --> 45:36.970
There must be a ventilation shaft!

45:36.970 --> 45:41.510
Ventilation shaft? You mean... That?

45:42.890 --> 45:44.350
So small!

45:47.730 --> 45:49.440
I found the smoke alarm!

45:49.440 --> 45:52.560
If we create a fire someone will come!

45:52.560 --> 45:53.940
But...

45:54.650 --> 45:56.990
We don't have a lighter or something like that.

46:08.200 --> 46:11.210
I'm 100% sure... it won't burn.

46:12.040 --> 46:14.170
This is impossible!

46:15.590 --> 46:18.790
1 hour later...

46:20.930 --> 46:22.800
So cold...

46:27.640 --> 46:29.940
Hey here...

46:31.230 --> 46:34.440
It's cold so why don't you get in too?

46:36.320 --> 46:39.720
I'm f-fine... I'm hot-blooded.

46:39.740 --> 46:44.030
What I mean is I feel cold.

46:57.130 --> 46:58.880
Hurry up!

47:05.470 --> 47:08.770
Ah Yoh smells so good.

47:08.770 --> 47:12.890
Co-could this be Yoh's surprise plan?

47:12.890 --> 47:19.360
Making sure we're alone letting me smell his wonderful scent and making me do something stupid?

47:19.360 --> 47:23.730
Ah~ Oh no it's a scent that'll make me fall in love!

47:23.740 --> 47:27.330
I can't! I can't like his scent or fall in love with him!

47:27.620 --> 47:29.540
I didn't plan this.

47:30.040 --> 47:31.250
You saw through me?

47:31.540 --> 47:32.460
Yeah.

47:32.460 --> 47:33.920
About the smell too?

47:34.580 --> 47:36.420
What smell?

47:43.800 --> 47:47.930
Oh no I'm going to die. I'm going to die for a different reason.

47:48.180 --> 47:49.850
This is that scene!

47:49.850 --> 47:54.730
"Our bodies will get colder and colder let's take off our clothes and warm each other." Isn't it?!

47:54.730 --> 47:57.110
That's if our clothes were wet right?

47:58.520 --> 48:00.230
You saw through me again?

48:00.860 --> 48:02.610
You absolutely said it out loud.

48:02.610 --> 48:04.240
So embarrassing!

48:04.240 --> 48:05.840
It's nothing different from the usual.

48:05.960 --> 48:09.330
That was definitely embarrassing!

48:10.990 --> 48:14.750
It's cold cold cold~

48:14.750 --> 48:16.500
it's so cold!

48:19.040 --> 48:20.250
Huh?

48:38.230 --> 48:40.980
I'm going to protect Yoh!

48:50.330 --> 48:52.370
Stop it you'll get hurt!

48:52.370 --> 48:53.950
I won't!

48:53.950 --> 48:57.500
If I don't break down this door it'll get worse for you!

48:57.500 --> 49:01.460
Because for me you are my important coach!

49:11.180 --> 49:15.230
I'll... help too.

49:16.230 --> 49:17.390
What?

49:17.890 --> 49:19.190
Because...

49:20.940 --> 49:23.320
I don't want you to get hurt.

49:23.780 --> 49:25.240
Huh?

49:25.820 --> 49:27.950
Let's do it together.

49:28.450 --> 49:30.530
Y-yeah.

49:33.490 --> 49:35.870
Ready go!

49:43.590 --> 49:45.380
What happened?

49:49.180 --> 49:50.930
Why are you guys here?

49:51.720 --> 49:53.560
Are you all right?

49:53.850 --> 49:56.810
You left your bag on your desk right?

49:56.810 --> 50:01.650
When I called Asami-chan she said she hadn't heard from Yoh or you.

50:01.690 --> 50:04.270
Maybe it was a prank by someone?

50:04.270 --> 50:06.530
What a mean thing to do!

50:08.900 --> 50:13.330
Aaaah!

50:15.040 --> 50:16.950
Everyone please take care of Yoh!

50:16.950 --> 50:18.460
Haruna!

50:19.920 --> 50:22.420
How dare she did this to my coach!

50:22.420 --> 50:24.880
I'll never forgive her!

50:29.930 --> 50:34.100
Kuroto Minami team's fourth player Matsuzaka Reona!

50:37.470 --> 50:39.940
Finally you remembered me!

50:39.940 --> 50:43.190
I'm so pissed at you for no remembering me this whole time!

50:43.190 --> 50:44.980
What are you trying to pull?

50:45.730 --> 50:49.190
We were rivals at the junior high school's softball competition.

50:49.190 --> 50:51.780
People called it the "N & M Battle" didn't they?

50:51.780 --> 50:55.240
Our teams were also competing against each other at the prefecture championship.

50:55.240 --> 51:00.160
But finally our school lost to yours and didn't win.

51:00.460 --> 51:03.080
I couldn't hit your ball.

51:03.080 --> 51:09.010
And so since that day I swore to myself I'll have my revenge in senior high school.

51:09.010 --> 51:11.930
I'll hit your ball next time in senior high school!

51:11.930 --> 51:14.930
And then I coincidentally transfered to the same school you're in.

51:15.140 --> 51:17.390
But you've quit softball.

51:17.390 --> 51:22.310
You've quit softball and you look so happy going out with some guy!

51:22.310 --> 51:28.440
While I swore off love and men and practice so hard every single day!

51:28.440 --> 51:30.610
That's why I wanted to break your relationship up!

51:30.610 --> 51:32.130
I'll make you miserable!

51:32.130 --> 51:32.150
We're not dating!
I'll make you miserable!

51:32.150 --> 51:32.610
I'll make you miserable!
We're not dating!

51:32.610 --> 51:34.890
We're not dating!

51:34.890 --> 51:34.910
Liar! If you two are not dating then why are you always together every day!
We're not dating!

51:34.910 --> 51:35.200
We're not dating!
Liar! If you two are not dating then why are you always together every day!

51:35.200 --> 51:38.990
Liar! If you two are not dating then why are you always together every day!

51:38.990 --> 51:42.660
He's my coach! In love.

51:46.210 --> 51:47.590
How stupid!

51:47.590 --> 51:51.340
Yoh-sama as your coach? He hates girls why would he do that?

51:51.340 --> 51:53.680
Stop telling such flimsy lies!

51:53.680 --> 51:56.890
That's right... Excuse me move aside.

51:56.890 --> 51:58.530
That's right! I--

51:58.530 --> 51:58.560
Enough! Shut up!
That's right! I--

51:58.560 --> 51:59.220
That's right! I--
Enough! Shut up!

51:59.220 --> 52:01.180
Enough! Shut up!

52:01.180 --> 52:01.980
I'm sorry.

52:01.980 --> 52:03.980
That's not even sincere!

52:10.440 --> 52:13.650
In short everyone hates you.

52:13.650 --> 52:16.570
So what do you want?

52:16.570 --> 52:19.200
Let's have a match. On the field.

52:19.200 --> 52:22.750
If I win you'll break up with Komiyama Yoh.

52:22.750 --> 52:25.170
I've decided to pursue love!

52:25.170 --> 52:28.130
I've decided to quit softball!

52:28.130 --> 52:30.210
Running away?

52:35.930 --> 52:37.640
Over there!

52:37.840 --> 52:39.680
What is she doing?

52:42.680 --> 52:46.190
I can't cause trouble for Yoh anymore than this.

52:49.650 --> 52:51.440
Fine.

52:51.440 --> 52:57.030
In exchange if I win all of you will stop bothering us.

52:57.030 --> 52:58.580
I got it.

52:58.750 --> 52:59.930
Got that?

52:59.930 --> 53:00.240
Yes!
Got that?

53:00.240 --> 53:01.580
Yes!

53:55.130 --> 54:01.220
I've practiced so hard while she got herself a boyfriend and had fun every day!!

54:01.260 --> 54:04.810
Give me back my points!

54:05.810 --> 54:08.560
Fall in love maiden.

54:22.200 --> 54:23.580
Umm...!

54:24.700 --> 54:27.910
I've caused you so much trouble.

54:28.330 --> 54:30.790
Yoh I'm sorry!

54:33.460 --> 54:37.880
But... I won!

54:40.130 --> 54:42.180
You're really amazing.

54:43.760 --> 54:46.140
When you smile you're really cute!

54:47.390 --> 54:50.640
Anyway it's almost Christmas soon.

54:51.560 --> 54:53.940
What will you do? You have to find a boyfriend.

54:54.310 --> 54:58.190
Yes Coach! But first of all your cold.

54:58.610 --> 54:59.780
That's right.

54:59.780 --> 55:02.990
Please take good care of yourself.

55:03.820 --> 55:05.700
I'll take my leave here today.

55:05.700 --> 55:07.490
Bye!

55:09.540 --> 55:10.960
Hey!

55:13.290 --> 55:17.500
Thank you... for today.

55:17.800 --> 55:19.170
Huh?

55:19.840 --> 55:21.170
Bye.

55:39.770 --> 55:41.820
Haru keeps writing "Yoh" on her textbook.

55:54.870 --> 55:58.420
I fell in love!

55:59.460 --> 56:03.880
But he's my coach so I can't fall for him!

56:03.880 --> 56:13.890
So frustrating! So painful! So unfair!

56:19.270 --> 56:24.030
Easy to start difficult to end.

56:24.860 --> 56:31.240
yesterday one said "I love you forever."

56:31.950 --> 56:35.540
Miss Haruna please read the next line.

56:38.630 --> 56:43.470
Miss Haruna please next read read read read!

56:43.470 --> 56:46.220
Miss Haruna please read the next line.

56:46.220 --> 56:49.800

56:49.800 --> 56:53.930
Look at me! Please Miss Haruna~ !

56:59.310 --> 57:02.440

57:02.440 --> 57:04.320
Thank you.

You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:10.080 --> 57:13.250

You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:44.820 --> 57:46.240
Ah! You're here.

57:46.530 --> 57:48.950
Wh-what a coincidence.

57:50.030 --> 57:51.580
Shall we go home together?

57:51.580 --> 57:52.780
Huh?

57:55.500 --> 57:58.870
Ah I can't. I have something to do.

58:00.170 --> 58:03.250
You look a bit strange today.

58:04.210 --> 58:06.130
Don't read my mind!

58:07.340 --> 58:09.220
It's obvious even if you try to hide it.

58:09.220 --> 58:10.510
What?

58:10.550 --> 58:13.260
You are the worst person in the world in hiding something.

58:14.720 --> 58:22.170
Meat bun meat bun meat bun meat bun meat bun meat bun meat bun...

58:22.170 --> 58:22.190

How did you... ?!

58:33.910 --> 58:35.240
See you later!

58:37.870 --> 58:46.130
I can't fall in love I can't fall in love I can't fall in love I can't fall in love I can't I can't I can't.

FIND A BOYFRIEND BEFORE CHRISTMAS
Popularity LessoN 4

59:13.820 --> 59:15.030
Him?

59:15.030 --> 59:16.240
Strike!

59:18.290 --> 59:19.450
Him?

59:20.330 --> 59:21.330
No!

59:23.580 --> 59:24.920
Him?

59:24.920 --> 59:26.500
Absolutely not!

59:27.500 --> 59:30.920
There must be someone among them who's your type!

59:30.920 --> 59:32.800
You won't make it by Christmas.

59:32.800 --> 59:34.180
Ah!

59:34.550 --> 59:36.720
Are you still hung up on Fumiya?

59:36.720 --> 59:39.140
What? What are you talking about? Absolutely not!

59:39.140 --> 59:39.810
What? What are you talking about? Absolutely not

59:39.810 --> 59:42.770
Then why aren't other guys good enough for you?

59:43.850 --> 59:44.670
That's true...

59:44.670 --> 59:44.690
Maybe that's because Haruna has someone she likes right?
That's true...

59:44.690 --> 59:45.310
That's true...
Maybe that's because Haruna has someone she likes right?

59:45.310 --> 59:47.940
Maybe that's because Haruna has someone she likes right?

59:48.050 --> 59:51.610
Compared to him other guys just won't do right?

59:52.400 --> 59:54.410
But... if that's the case why doesn't she go to him?

59:54.410 --> 59:56.580
There must be a reason why she can't.

59:57.030 --> 59:58.540
Right?

59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.020
No no no no!

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:00.040
Then... will you go out with me?
No no no no!

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:00.330
No no no no!
Then... will you go out with me?

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:02.210
Then... will you go out with me?

01:00:03.370 --> 01:00:05.210
I can't I can't I can't I can't!

01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:06.840
I'm kidding.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.800
You're so cute Haruna-chan.

01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:28.570
Are you thinking?

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:30.570
I am.

01:00:32.570 --> 01:00:36.660
You know... what should I do?

01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:39.990
I fell in love with someone I shouldn't...

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:42.330
Me too.

01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:44.230
I don't know what to do.

01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.250
What?
I don't know what to do.

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:44.710
I don't know what to do.
What?

01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:45.790
What?

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.540
You're having love troubles too?

01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:53.920
I... I can't forget my ex-boyfriend.

01:00:54.930 --> 01:01:00.850
It's almost Christmas and... I'll feel lonely by myself.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.520
When I realized it I ended up calling him.

01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:09.980
But he didn't pick up at all!

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:14.240
What is that? How mean!

01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:18.240
I was the one who said goodbye but...

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:21.700
my feelings haven't changed.

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:26.830
That's why... I want to see him one more time!

01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:29.540
I want to talk to him one more time!

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:35.050
All right then! Let's meet him! Directly!

01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:37.260
Let's go to his house!

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:39.470
I'll go with you!

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:41.760
Really?

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.470
Thank you.

01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:47.940
I'm Kurihara Makoto.

01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:49.900
Ah Makko-chan right?

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:54.480
I'm Nagashima Haruna. Leave it to me!

01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:58.530
By the way...

01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:01.950
Am I in a position to be involved in someone else's problem?

01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:06.870
Don't fall in love with someone you're not allowed to fall in love with Haruna!

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:11.590
No! If you love him just let him know that!

01:02:11.590 --> 01:02:13.750
If not you'll never know!

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:17.440
Imagine it you might be spending Christmas with a boyfriend!

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:17.470
No! You have to keep your promise!
Imagine it you might be spending Christmas with a boyfriend!

01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:18.220
Imagine it you might be spending Christmas with a boyfriend!
No! You have to keep your promise!

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:19.590
No! You have to keep your promise!

01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:21.510
Yoh has a relationship phobia.

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:24.680
Isn't it good enough if he remains as your coach?

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.680
Stop it you two! Stop it!

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:30.940
You should confess. You might date him!

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:33.940
No! If you get rejected you may never see him ever again!

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:36.230
Shut up! Always so noisy!

01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:39.490
You look disgusting!

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.470
I am a girl.

01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.490
You're a girl? But you're balding!
I am a girl.

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:41.410
I am a girl.
You're a girl? But you're balding!

01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:43.120
You're a girl? But you're balding!

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:43.930
No I have thin hair.

01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:43.950
Thin hair? That's balding! You have patches!
No I have thin hair.

01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:44.410
No I have thin hair.
Thin hair? That's balding! You have patches!

01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:46.720
Thin hair? That's balding! You have patches!

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:46.750
Patches?
Thin hair? That's balding! You have patches!

01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:46.890
Thin hair? That's balding! You have patches!
Patches?

01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:47.350
Patches?

01:02:47.350 --> 01:02:47.950
And your face looks like a lobster!
Patches?

01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:49.270
And your face looks like a lobster!

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:49.290
Yes yes. I'm a lobster
And your face looks like a lobster!

01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:49.580
And your face looks like a lobster!
Yes yes. I'm a lobster

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:52.040
Yes yes. I'm a lobster

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:54.920
Scary scary scary scary scary!

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:56.880
Stop it!

01:02:58.260 --> 01:02:59.400
Don't do it for real!

01:02:59.400 --> 01:02:59.420
Who are you calling a lobster!
Don't do it for real!

01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:00.300
Don't do it for real!
Who are you calling a lobster!

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:00.840
Who are you calling a lobster!

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:03.850
You! You just won't stop! I don't want to be called names by you!

01:03:03.850 --> 01:03:08.640
There there. The two of you please just calm down!

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:09.940
Okay?

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:11.900
Who are you?

01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:14.190
I'm the foreigner helper...

01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.650
In other words... a foreigner who helps...

01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:17.210
This is not helping.
In other words... a foreigner who helps...

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:17.230
This is not helping.

01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:18.440
In other words... a foreigner who helps...

01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:28.520
What are you doing?

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:28.540
Yoh Yoh Yoh Yoh Yoh!
What are you doing?

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:29.080
What are you doing?
Yoh Yoh Yoh Yoh Yoh!

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:29.960
Yoh Yoh Yoh Yoh Yoh!

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.640
I said what are you doing?

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.220
Series of sideway jumps.

01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:43.130
I know that.

01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:45.890
Why are you doing it at the park at night?

01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:51.690
Banishing evil thoughts. Like throwing them... throwing them to the side.

01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:53.690
I don't get it.

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:02.950
You're a girl it's not safe for you to be out here alone.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.410
Let's go home.

01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:05.990
Yes.

01:04:09.790 --> 01:04:12.580
This is a God-given chance!

01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:15.380
Yoh... I've decided.

01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:16.880
I've decided!

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:20.920
What have you decided?

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.510
Nothing.

01:04:24.550 --> 01:04:27.600
More importantly have you decided what to do for Christmas?

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.260
It's coming soon.

01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:32.930
You know...
You know...

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:36.270
You can go first.

01:04:39.730 --> 01:04:41.480
Um...

01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:45.410
I've fallen in love!

01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:52.750
I've fallen in love but..

01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:56.330
With Asaoka right?

01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:58.920
Huh?

01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:01.590
Why don't you try going out with Asaoka?

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.050
What?

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:11.970
I thought Asaoka and you might be good together.

01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:17.730
Idiot!

01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:20.480
You're...

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:24.190
You're fired as my coach!

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:22.670
♪ Am I in love with love itself?

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:27.050

You've got mail it's Dave.

01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:26.350
Can we meet now? Makoto.

01:07:30.490 --> 01:07:35.530
Hey so what's your ex-boyfriend like?

01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:42.670
He's cool and he has lots of friends.

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:49.210
But he's kinda scary I don't know what he's thinking of at all.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:54.470
But he can be kind too.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:58.890
Yeah I know what you mean.

01:07:59.890 --> 01:08:02.390
I hope it'll go well Makko-chan!

01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:04.900
Thank you.

01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:12.320
We're here.

01:08:17.529 --> 01:08:19.120
E-e-ex...

01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:22.910
Onii-chan dated the manager.

01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:25.790
I can't forget my ex-boyfriend.

01:08:26.210 --> 01:08:28.250
E-ex-girlfriend... ?

01:08:35.050 --> 01:08:36.930
What is it Haruna-chan?

01:08:37.890 --> 01:08:39.220
You know him?

01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:41.270
N-n-n-no!

01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:44.939
Then... I'll just wait here.

01:08:45.479 --> 01:08:47.270
Good luck!

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:49.270
Yes!

01:08:58.279 --> 01:08:59.910
Yoh...

01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:16.590
Ah!

01:09:18.090 --> 01:09:20.930
Um... is Yoh home?

01:09:22.350 --> 01:09:25.520
I'm sorry he hasn't come home yet.

01:09:29.609 --> 01:09:31.939
Excuse me.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.080
It's obvious that...

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:45.370
he hates me!

01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:53.210
So you know him?

01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:54.880
Yes!

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.470
Are you dating him?

01:09:58.010 --> 01:09:59.430
No no no!

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:01.970
He's just an acquaintance.

01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:04.520
Thank goodness.

01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:11.230
We had a really good relationship.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:15.530
We went home together every day

01:10:16.030 --> 01:10:18.700
and we went to many places together.

01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:23.870
And you held hands?

01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:26.500
Yes we did.

01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:31.920
A-and kissing? You did that?

01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:34.960
Yes.

01:10:45.390 --> 01:10:47.890
What's wrong Haruna-chan?

01:10:47.890 --> 01:10:50.270
No! Nothing!

01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:59.490
I thought I'd forget about him once I'm in senior high school. But I couldn't.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:05.450
That's why I've written him a letter. Asking him if he could meet me on Christmas Eve.

01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:09.210
But... I couldn't even give it to him.

01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:16.000
I know it's not something I can ask of you.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.930
But can you give this to Yoh?

01:11:20.930 --> 01:11:23.050
What?

01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:27.890
I know it sounds crazy but you're the only one I have!

01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:30.890
This is the last time I'll impose on you. OK?

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:35.190
Wait Makoto-chan!

01:11:44.530 --> 01:11:47.240
Whaaaaaaat!

01:12:15.190 --> 01:12:17.320
I can't read it!

01:12:56.770 --> 01:12:59.730
Yoh did something happen?

01:12:59.730 --> 01:13:01.610
Did something happen with Haruna-chan?

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.910
You're fired as my coach!

01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:09.450
It's not my problem anymore.

01:13:09.450 --> 01:13:14.210
You know Yoh you actually care about Haruna-chan right?

01:13:14.210 --> 01:13:15.370
What?

01:13:15.370 --> 01:13:21.920
You actually like her but you're just too scared to face it aren't you?

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.510
Shut up.

01:13:27.090 --> 01:13:32.220
Then shall I ask Haruna-chan out?

01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:33.730
Do what you want.

01:13:35.690 --> 01:13:37.600
All right OK!

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:40.020
We'll go on a date!

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:45.450
Haruna-chan!

01:13:45.450 --> 01:13:48.490
Huh? Asaoka-san?

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:50.950
You look like a ghost.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:51.620
I... Yoh...

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:54.960
I... Yoh...

01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:05.220
I have a plan. You want in?

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.300
OK so it's a date!

01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:22.400
Let's watch this movie!

01:14:23.610 --> 01:14:26.570
"The number one movie in US that makes people want to kiss!"

01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:29.030
No complaints with this right?

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:33.290
Seems like a movie Yoh would hate though...

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:35.580
Haruna-chan.

01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:36.100
Yes?

01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:36.120
Let's not talk about Yoh.
Yes?

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:36.580
Yes?
Let's not talk about Yoh.

01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:38.120
Let's not talk about Yoh.

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:41.290
Huh? Yes! I'm sorry.

01:14:41.290 --> 01:14:44.170
It's okay it's okay. Let's go!

01:14:48.090 --> 01:14:50.140
Harun-chan is it delicious?

01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:51.970
Yes!

01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:04.190
Yoh...

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.820
Haruna-chan what do you think about me?

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.910
I think you're a really nice guy.

01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:18.710
I'm so happy.

01:15:18.710 --> 01:15:22.790
Is it okay for me to take that as a positive sign?

01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:24.590
Yes.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.970
Actually... I'm not that nice of a guy.

01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:30.930
Eh?

01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:34.510
You're so dense...

01:15:35.810 --> 01:15:38.350
I like you Haruna-chan.

01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:39.600
What?

01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:41.350
I like you.

01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:43.270
I really want you to be my girlfriend.

01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:45.900
B-but...

01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:49.280
Forget about Yoh.

01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:54.280
No! No!

01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:02.330
I'll let you off.

01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:05.880
Yoh...

01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:10.550
I knew you'd come.

01:16:15.930 --> 01:16:18.810
OK I'm going home.

01:16:18.810 --> 01:16:21.270
Haruna-chan that was all an act.

01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:23.230
Forget all of it.

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:33.240
I'm really a nice guy huh?

01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:40.620
Yoh... why did you come?

01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:42.910
No...

01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:48.960
I still have something to teach you.

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:53.970
I'm so happy!

01:16:55.890 --> 01:17:00.970
On Christmas Eve shall we go on a date?

01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:02.930
What?

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.600
As a lesson.

01:17:06.190 --> 01:17:07.900
Yes!

01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:52.860
Coach!

01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:55.070
What do you think?

01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:59.240
You look cute.

01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:01.280
Whaaat?

01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:03.580
Say it again!

01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:05.000
No way!

01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:09.250
Even so say it again!

01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:11.500
I see my clothes...

01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:13.590
But I'm happy!

01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:15.880
All of you!

01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:18.840
Let's have fun!

01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:58.510
I'll go buy some juice.

01:18:58.510 --> 01:18:59.930
Oh okay!

01:19:18.150 --> 01:19:19.200
What do you want?

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:23.070
Letter! I mean o-orange juice!

01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:24.700
A hot one.

01:19:53.810 --> 01:19:56.940
She wrote can we meet on Christmas Eve?

01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:06.950
Yoh no! This is not the time to whirl around!

01:20:07.330 --> 01:20:08.450
Huh?

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.920
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:14.540
Here.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:15.420
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:16.800
What is this?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:32.140
Since when did you know her?

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:41.030
Why did you keep this?

01:20:41.490 --> 01:20:44.280
Because I understand her feelings.

01:20:45.450 --> 01:20:47.200
You should've thrown it away.

01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:49.540
I couldn't.

01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:51.450
It's her feelings.

01:20:56.630 --> 01:20:59.500
Yoh go and see her.

01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:02.380
Huh?

01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:08.350
Even if you don't meet her today you might meet her someday coincidentally.

01:21:08.350 --> 01:21:14.480
I don't want you to run away or hide from her when that happens.

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:16.940
The past can't be erased.

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:20.900
But if you don't run away you might create a good memory.

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.570
That's why go and see her.

01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:25.160
Don't run away!

01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:29.580
Is it okay?

01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:36.250
If I see her I don't know what will happen.

01:21:37.670 --> 01:21:39.380
It's okay.

01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:41.170
Go and see her.

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:46.970
But... at least let me tell you this.

01:21:48.370 --> 01:21:54.560
I... I...

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.770
I love you!

01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:03.240
Because I love you...

01:22:04.150 --> 01:22:06.910
Because I fell in love with you...

01:22:06.910 --> 01:22:10.910
Because even though I wasn't allowed to I fell in love with you.

01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:13.500
It won't work out either way.

01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:18.420
That's why go and see her.

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:22.170
So... goodbye.

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:48.410
It was really... really... goodbye.

01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:51.580
My shoelace broke...

01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:54.240
It's bad luck!

01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:56.750
Huh?

01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:03.920
Bad luck!!!

01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:12.050
I didn't think you'd come.

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:19.390
This place brings back memories huh?

01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:20.940
Yeah.

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:25.230
We used to buy juice and talk here after club activities finished right?

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:34.160
Ah! That's...

01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:41.250
Right now...

01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:45.210
Right now I feel we can be together again.

01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:53.970
Let's go see the all-round together!

01:23:55.260 --> 01:24:00.390
Nooooooooooooooo!

01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:04.510
I can't.

01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:07.230
After all I love Yoh.

01:24:07.530 --> 01:24:09.860
I don't want to lose him!

01:24:32.430 --> 01:24:33.760
Yoh...

01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:35.930
Yoh!

01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:41.480
Yoh!

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:43.810
Yoh!

01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:46.900
Yoh!

01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:50.820
Yoh!

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:54.110
Yoh!

01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:06.040
Yoh I love you!

01:25:22.810 --> 01:25:25.350
Huh?

01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:26.940
Where's my shoe?

01:25:29.730 --> 01:25:31.290
You dropped this.

01:25:31.410 --> 01:25:33.820
More like it flew.

01:26:03.770 --> 01:26:08.360
The first time we met it was like this too right?

01:26:12.610 --> 01:26:14.490
I finally found you.

01:26:20.370 --> 01:26:26.290
I met Makoto... and we talked.

01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:33.260
That's when I finally understood.

01:26:35.050 --> 01:26:36.800
The good things about you.

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:40.300
Your determination.

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:41.930
Yes.

01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:44.220
Your strong throw.

01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:45.980
Yes.

01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:47.890
What else?

01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:50.520
You're stupidly honest.

01:26:51.150 --> 01:26:52.570
Yes.

01:26:52.690 --> 01:26:56.900
And then... you eat like a pig.

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:00.780
Are you praising me?

01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:03.240
I absolutely am.

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:07.350
I...

01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:12.750
Love you.

01:27:13.630 --> 01:27:15.800
It has nothing to do with your makeup

01:27:16.670 --> 01:27:18.550
clothes

01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:21.930
or being popular among men.

01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:25.220
Just the way you are...

01:27:25.930 --> 01:27:28.640
I love you.

01:27:35.230 --> 01:27:39.910
I'll only say it once so listen carefully.

01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:43.780
Haruna...

01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.910
Please go out with me.

01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:55.670
Say it again!

01:27:56.250 --> 01:27:58.300
I knew you'd say that.

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:55.690
Coaching is over!
