NARRATOR: Previously,
on "Dance Academy"--

00:04.440 --> 00:06.160
you're never going to make.

00:06.200 --> 00:08.640
You're not good enough,
and you never will be.

00:08.679 --> 00:11.039
-This is like one of those
celeb-style meltdowns.

00:11.080 --> 00:12.519
We should put it online.

00:12.560 --> 00:14.560
-I'd very much like to dance
"The Red Shoes" in the Pre, if

00:14.599 --> 00:15.560
that's OK with you.

00:15.599 --> 00:17.199
-From what I saw, it
looks promising.

00:17.239 --> 00:18.399
-Guess we'd better
get started. if

00:18.440 --> 00:19.760
that's OK with you.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.079
CHRISTIAN (OFFSCREEN): I though
I needed a break from

00:21.120 --> 00:22.280
this place.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.679
I think I need a break
from us-- a break up.

00:28.160 --> 00:29.679
-Uh OK, sorry.

00:29.719 --> 00:31.600
-It wasn't your fault.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.399
-It sort of was.

00:33.439 --> 00:35.679
-You are really talented, Kat.

00:35.719 --> 00:38.039
But you're just not ready
for this contract.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.159
OK, in a few years, with
some more training and

00:40.200 --> 00:42.359
experience, who knows.

00:42.399 --> 00:43.560
-Katrina?

00:46.479 --> 00:59.320
[theme song]

00:59.359 --> 01:02.719
Take a breath.

01:02.759 --> 01:06.680
Close your eyes.

01:06.719 --> 01:14.640
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.599
This is my chance.

01:16.640 --> 01:20.599
This is my chance, my chance
to feel alive.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.760
-What did you say?

01:34.799 --> 01:37.799
-I want to um--

01:37.840 --> 01:40.519
I want to come back
to the Academy.

01:40.560 --> 01:44.640
I know I made some really
big mistakes last year.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.079
-I'm not arguing.

01:46.120 --> 01:49.040
-It's just that, if you give me
a second chance, I promise

01:49.079 --> 01:50.239
I'll be worth it.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.200
-This is the top dance school
in the country.

01:52.239 --> 01:54.319
To get in once is the chance
of a lifetime.

01:54.359 --> 01:55.599
It doesn't happen twice.

01:55.640 --> 01:56.920
-I know.

01:56.959 --> 01:58.359
I know, and I absolutely hear
what you're saying.

01:58.400 --> 01:59.359
I do.

01:59.400 --> 02:02.319
But I am going to be
the exception.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.479
TARA (OFFSCREEN): My first
pair of pointe

02:08.520 --> 02:10.360
shoes lasted a year.

02:10.400 --> 02:11.680
And when they finally
died, I buried

02:11.719 --> 02:14.719
them in the top paddock.

02:14.759 --> 02:16.800
These days, I'm dancing so much
they're lucky to make it

02:16.840 --> 02:17.520
through the week.

02:17.560 --> 02:18.680
-Morning Ms. Raine.

02:18.719 --> 02:20.039
-Katrina.

02:22.240 --> 02:23.800
TARA (OFFSCREEN): You want
pointe shoes to be soft,

02:23.840 --> 02:28.039
because that's when your
feet look their best.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.319
-See this, Lieberman.

02:29.360 --> 02:31.400
I'm actually running
rings around you.

02:31.439 --> 02:33.560
TARA (OFFSCREEN): But not so
unsupportive that you could

02:33.599 --> 02:35.840
injure yourself.

02:35.879 --> 02:42.840
The problem is, there's only a
few degrees between worn in,

02:42.879 --> 02:49.800
worn down, and worn out.

03:03.840 --> 03:06.719
I guess everything, like
everyone, has it's own

03:06.759 --> 03:08.080
breaking point.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.199
-I have an actual
job, Abigail.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.639
I have company rehearsals.

03:18.680 --> 03:20.599
And I have preliminaries
next week.

03:20.639 --> 03:21.639
And you're my choreographer.

03:21.680 --> 03:22.840
We're rehearsing every
night this week.

03:22.879 --> 03:24.800
-Uh correction, I'm a
choreographer, not your

03:24.840 --> 03:25.599
choreographer.

03:25.639 --> 03:26.800
I'm doing you a favor here.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.159
Don't get so demanding.

03:29.199 --> 03:31.199
-Ethan, hey, can you sit here
for a sec, because I haven't

03:31.240 --> 03:34.439
been to the toilet since-- no,
no, that's not apple juice.

03:34.479 --> 03:38.120
-You know you're not camping
out for tickets.

03:38.159 --> 03:39.599
-This isn't the line
to see Gaga?

03:39.639 --> 03:40.120
-No.

03:40.159 --> 03:41.360
-Oh?

03:41.400 --> 03:43.120
-Ms. Raine's not going to
respond to a stunt.

03:43.159 --> 03:45.159
She need to know that you're
serious this time.

03:50.840 --> 03:53.039
-Sweetie, I know you have a
problem with criticism.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.639
But if you can't maintain
you're turn-out, your

03:54.680 --> 03:56.479
extensions will just
have to be lower.

03:56.520 --> 03:58.240
-I don't understand your
corrections, Saskia.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.560
It looks pretty turned
out to me.

03:59.599 --> 04:01.199
-That's because you're cheating
your line and

04:01.240 --> 04:02.400
fishing your foot.

04:06.560 --> 04:08.599
To the barre, I'll show you--

04:08.639 --> 04:09.800
arabesque.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.720
See how tight she is in
the hip rotators.

04:17.759 --> 04:19.160
-Looks pretty flexy to me.

04:19.199 --> 04:21.199
But what would I know?

04:21.240 --> 04:22.639
I know that's a bit
embarrassing.

04:22.680 --> 04:23.759
But that's all you
can control.

04:23.800 --> 04:26.279
-I can control it higher.

04:26.319 --> 04:28.199
OK, how's that?

04:28.240 --> 04:30.120
-Fine, fantastic.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.120
-And this?

04:31.160 --> 04:33.160
-Never felt better.

04:33.199 --> 04:34.120
Oh, that-- that's enough.

04:34.160 --> 04:35.519
-Oh, I thought you
were flexible.

04:35.560 --> 04:36.199
You want to go higher?

04:36.240 --> 04:37.199
-No, no, no, stop.

04:37.240 --> 04:38.040
-Saskia.

04:38.079 --> 04:39.160
-Are you teaching this class?

04:44.199 --> 04:47.560
[cracking]

04:47.600 --> 04:49.160
She's fine.

04:49.199 --> 04:51.199
My teachers did that
to me all the time.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.079
You really need to concentrate
on your rotation.

04:54.120 --> 04:55.199
Ben, you're up.

04:55.240 --> 04:56.160
-Are you OK.

04:56.199 --> 04:57.399
-Uh yeah, just a little
bit shaky.

04:57.439 --> 04:59.639
-Any time now, or are you
hormonal as well?

05:08.560 --> 05:10.480
-I understand, Lady Charleton.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.600
I can assure you, there's no
problem with discipline.

05:12.639 --> 05:16.399
The internet incident
was a one-off.

05:16.439 --> 05:16.839
-Play it, Sam.

05:16.879 --> 05:19.639
-Katrina.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.800
-Petition to be granted an
obligation for a audition,

05:21.839 --> 05:23.800
just like any other candidate.

05:23.839 --> 05:25.759
-Reason number one-- the
applicant feels deep,

05:25.800 --> 05:28.240
demonstrable regret
over her previous

05:28.279 --> 05:29.439
lackadaisical attitude.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.240
-Oh uh yes, Lady Charleton,
you have

05:31.279 --> 05:32.279
my undivided attention.

05:32.319 --> 05:34.800
Get out, now.

05:34.839 --> 05:36.279
-Reason number two--

05:36.319 --> 05:38.759
the applicant has now clocked
hours of professional dance

05:38.800 --> 05:39.600
employment.

05:39.639 --> 05:40.639
-And only ever been fired once.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.120
-Twice.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.120
-References.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.120
-This is ridiculous.

05:45.160 --> 05:47.160
Oh, no, no, no.

05:47.199 --> 05:48.600
Not you, Lady Charleton--

05:48.639 --> 05:51.800
no, no, I was just talking to
uh, uh a bird that's just

05:51.839 --> 05:53.600
flown into my office.

05:53.639 --> 05:56.480
Yes, yes, it's a rather
large bird.

05:56.519 --> 05:58.120
Can I call you back?

05:58.160 --> 06:01.199
Thank you.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.480
-Reason number three--

06:02.519 --> 06:04.639
the applicant is desperate.

06:04.680 --> 06:05.839
-Evidently.

06:12.279 --> 06:15.399
There are auditions next week
for the junior school.

06:15.439 --> 06:18.800
You can come in then, as a
favor to your parents.

06:18.839 --> 06:20.800
Although, judging by that
display of technique, I

06:20.839 --> 06:22.279
wouldn't get your hopes up.

06:27.560 --> 06:29.680
[cheering]

06:29.720 --> 06:32.439
-I so wish that I could help you
train, but Saskia's been

06:32.480 --> 06:33.319
on my back.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.279
-Literally.

06:34.319 --> 06:35.439
How are you feeling now?

06:35.480 --> 06:36.839
-Unfortunately, I'm a
bad friend as well.

06:36.879 --> 06:39.040
Ollie's schedule is brutal.

06:39.079 --> 06:40.160
Hence the need for sustenance.

06:40.199 --> 06:41.519
-You know I eat when
I get nervous.

06:41.560 --> 06:42.120
-And happy.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.319
-And cold.

06:43.360 --> 06:43.759
-Bored.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.399
-Ha ha ha.

06:45.439 --> 06:49.199
-Christian and I can always
whip you into shape.

06:49.240 --> 06:49.839
-Good.

06:49.879 --> 06:50.720
Thank you, everyone.

06:50.759 --> 06:53.600
But it's not necessary.

06:53.639 --> 06:56.759
If you remember, I have
been dancing all year.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.759
I couldn't be more prepared
, if I was, well--

06:59.800 --> 07:01.319
-Prepared?

07:01.360 --> 07:02.519
-Mm-hm.

07:08.680 --> 07:12.639
-I don't think standing there
qualifies as training.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.240
I was visualizing.

07:15.279 --> 07:17.319
-Mm, how'd that go?

07:17.360 --> 07:18.560
-It made me hungry.

07:21.199 --> 07:22.199
-I mean it.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.240
You have to help.

07:24.279 --> 07:26.800
I'm sure you have better
things to do.

07:26.839 --> 07:28.439
-Remember the elastic band.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.199
both legs need to reach maximum

07:30.240 --> 07:32.639
stretch at the same time.

07:32.680 --> 07:35.800
-You know, you're
good at this--

07:35.839 --> 07:37.560
teaching.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.800
-Don't try to distract me.

07:39.839 --> 07:42.319
-You're sickly.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.560
Here.

07:51.439 --> 07:53.160
Really separate them out.

08:01.879 --> 08:03.800
Kat?

08:03.839 --> 08:06.480
-I um--

08:06.519 --> 08:07.720
I have to skedaddle.

08:10.199 --> 08:12.800
-We said, it doesn't have
to get weird between us.

08:12.839 --> 08:15.800
It was just one moment.

08:15.839 --> 08:17.759
-Yeah, totally.

08:17.800 --> 08:20.319
Except it's like 100
different moments.

08:23.839 --> 08:25.160
Do you remember this?

08:27.800 --> 08:29.120
-People-phobic.

08:32.279 --> 08:39.480
-So in a disastrous maneuver,
I've kind of had feelings for

08:39.519 --> 08:42.799
you since the start
of last year.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.519
And you're pretending not to be,
but you're in love with my

08:45.559 --> 08:47.320
best friend.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.559
-So everyone keeps telling me.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.159
-Which I absolutely support.

08:51.200 --> 08:54.320
It's just that, it's tough
for me sometimes.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.320
And you're making it worse.

08:56.360 --> 08:59.320
-What should I be doing then?

08:59.360 --> 09:01.440
-Well, If I'm coming back
to the Academy.

09:01.480 --> 09:03.720
Then, there needs
to be a buffer.

09:03.759 --> 09:07.200
I can't train with you.

09:07.240 --> 09:08.720
I can't even be friends
with you.

09:08.759 --> 09:10.759
-That's crap.

09:10.799 --> 09:12.799
We've always been friends.

09:12.840 --> 09:14.159
-You have.

09:16.600 --> 09:19.799
I've um--

09:19.840 --> 09:21.200
I've sort of been pretending.

09:29.879 --> 09:33.399
-Sammy, I need you.

09:37.039 --> 09:37.840
-Sorry.

09:37.879 --> 09:39.279
I didn't think you'd be here.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.600
-You're avoiding me?

09:41.639 --> 09:44.559
-No um--

09:44.600 --> 09:47.200
yeah.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.480
Grace was out.

09:48.519 --> 09:50.600
So I thought I'd get Sammy
to heat-cream my back.

09:50.639 --> 09:52.159
But it's fine.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.440
-Hand it over.

09:55.480 --> 09:56.639
-You don't have to.

10:07.039 --> 10:09.399
-You're muscles are
all in spasm.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.480
-Yeah, I strained
it in coaching.

10:11.519 --> 10:13.159
It'll be fixed by tomorrow.

10:19.320 --> 10:20.240
Thank you.

10:20.279 --> 10:21.440
-No worries.

10:27.639 --> 10:29.720
-I come to you grovelling.

10:29.759 --> 10:30.759
You're right.

10:30.799 --> 10:32.080
Now, it's time to get serious.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.279
-I appreciate that, but I'm
flat out at the moment.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.279
-Oh, come on.

10:35.320 --> 10:36.320
This is your dream scenario.

10:36.360 --> 10:37.759
You live to tell
me what to do.

10:37.799 --> 10:40.120
-Yeah, and you never listen,
which is why you obviously

10:40.159 --> 10:42.320
need a trainer who will
inspire discipline.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.759
Perfect timing.

10:44.799 --> 10:46.360
-For what?

10:46.399 --> 10:47.039
-My sister.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.399
I believe you've met.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.759
She needs someone who'll push
her to breaking point.

10:50.799 --> 10:53.240
-I prefer to take my chances.

10:53.279 --> 10:56.159
-In what universe would
I agreed to help Kat?

10:56.200 --> 10:58.679
-The one where I require payment
for my choreography.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.120
-You never said I
had to pay you.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.759
-We are flesh and
blood, Ethan.

11:01.799 --> 11:03.320
-Oh, come on.

11:03.360 --> 11:04.399
It'll be mutually beneficial.

11:04.440 --> 11:05.399
You need to stop obsessing.

11:05.440 --> 11:07.759
And you need to obsess more.

11:07.799 --> 11:11.120
Now, I expect nothing
less than magic.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.120
-You haven't done a classical
class all year?

11:20.159 --> 11:21.559
-No.

11:21.600 --> 11:25.200
-And before today, you've never
partaken in any sort of

11:25.240 --> 11:26.639
calorie control?

11:26.679 --> 11:28.000
-No.

11:28.039 --> 11:30.159
-You have no core strength.

11:30.200 --> 11:34.320
And you're attitude can only
be described as sketchy.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.480
-I wouldn't go that far.

11:35.519 --> 11:36.240
-I know.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.279
That wasn't a question.

11:38.320 --> 11:39.639
-Thank you, Anna Wintour.

11:39.679 --> 11:41.240
But look, I'm on a deadline.

11:41.279 --> 11:42.759
Are you gonna help
me or heckle?

11:42.799 --> 11:44.480
-[scoffs]

11:44.519 --> 11:47.320
It's gratifying how, for years,
you've made fun of my

11:47.360 --> 11:49.600
dedication and choices.

11:49.639 --> 11:52.600
And now you stand her
wanting my guidance.

11:52.639 --> 11:55.600
You'll do what I say,
when I say it.

11:55.639 --> 11:56.440
-You say, jump.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.600
I locate a cliff.

11:59.639 --> 12:00.759
Give me 100.

12:00.799 --> 12:03.480
-I was speaking metaphorically.

12:03.519 --> 12:05.759
Look, I have six days to
get ballet friendly.

12:05.799 --> 12:07.320
Can't I just do a class?

12:07.360 --> 12:09.799
-Cardio first, ballet
comes later.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.200
Come on.

12:18.639 --> 12:20.120
-That's one.

12:24.080 --> 12:29.159
-11, 12, activate your
pelvic floor.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.120
-Ew.

12:31.159 --> 12:32.360
-Breathe.

-What are your legs?

-Flabby, useless
lumps of lard.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.279

14:08.320 --> 14:10.279
-Propel me into the air.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.639
-How high are you gonna jump?

14:11.679 --> 14:12.679
-High as an eagle.

14:12.720 --> 14:13.679
-How high are you gonna jump?

14:13.720 --> 14:14.679
-As high as an eagle.

14:29.399 --> 14:31.720
-You need to do something
about that, toots.

14:31.759 --> 14:34.039
-Dr. Wicks would make
me take time off.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.519
And it'll give Saskia way too
much satisfaction, with the

14:36.559 --> 14:37.320
Pre coming up.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.120
-Then go further afield.

14:39.159 --> 14:41.000
There's gotta be a young,
hot sports doctor

14:41.039 --> 14:42.559
dying for your business.

14:42.600 --> 14:46.279
-You know the most sacred of
Academy rules, thou shalt not

14:46.320 --> 14:47.759
see an outside doctor.

14:47.799 --> 14:50.799
-So but isn't it pointless to
jeopardize the Pre, when you

14:50.840 --> 14:54.039
probably just need some
anti-inflammatories?

14:54.080 --> 14:55.600
Or I could acupuncture you.

14:55.639 --> 14:59.639
We used to do it on Taffy
all the time.

14:59.679 --> 15:01.000
She was such a loyal dog.

15:01.039 --> 15:03.279
-What was wrong with
her, arthritis?

15:03.320 --> 15:05.559
-No, bulimia--

15:05.600 --> 15:08.360
tragic self-esteem issues.

15:08.399 --> 15:09.559
Mm.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.080
-All right.

15:18.120 --> 15:19.159
You're left leg's tighter.

15:19.200 --> 15:20.799
But you're very mobile.

15:20.840 --> 15:23.200
-It's usually my good side.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.159
-I'm going to run
this pen down.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.799
You tell me if the sensation
changes.

15:26.840 --> 15:29.679
It should be pretty sharp.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.159
Have you had any back
pain before.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.559
-Sore muscles are kind
of a standard,

15:33.600 --> 15:34.799
when you're a dancer.

15:34.840 --> 15:37.399
-Yeah, whenever the footy
players winge to me.

15:37.440 --> 15:40.799
I always tell them how hard
core you guys are.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.559
-That's a bit duller.

15:42.600 --> 15:43.799
-There?

15:43.840 --> 15:44.960
-Yeah.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.639
Do you think I need some
anti-inflammatories?

15:47.679 --> 15:49.000
-I tell you what.

15:49.039 --> 15:51.440
While you're here, let's
get you in for an MRI.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.360
-Is something wrong?

15:53.399 --> 15:54.399
-Probably not.

15:54.440 --> 15:55.159
I'd just like to have
a look around.

15:59.039 --> 16:01.120
-Ah, just the way you like it.

16:01.159 --> 16:04.120
And whatever crazy hoops you
want to put me through

16:04.159 --> 16:06.120
tomorrow, I am ready.

16:06.159 --> 16:08.759
-For first year, we're looking
at ballet technique.

16:08.799 --> 16:11.600
Was that crazy last
time around?

16:11.639 --> 16:12.600
-No.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.000
But I'm auditioning
for second year.

16:14.039 --> 16:16.279
-Remember, I've already
done first year.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.559
-I remember that you failed.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.559
Even if you do audition
successfully, you know, you're

16:20.600 --> 16:21.639
going to have to repeat.

16:21.679 --> 16:23.360
-But all my friends are
in second year.

16:23.399 --> 16:24.440
-I thought this was
about ballet,

16:24.480 --> 16:26.519
not your social interests.

16:26.559 --> 16:32.120
-Ms. Rain, when you first let me
into the Academy, was that

16:32.159 --> 16:33.559
because I was good enough?

16:33.600 --> 16:37.440
Or was that just another
favor to my parents?

16:37.480 --> 16:38.759
-I'll see you tomorrow,
Katrina.

16:51.759 --> 16:58.600
[phone ringing]

16:58.639 --> 17:01.799
-Hi, it's me.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.159
-What's up?

17:04.799 --> 17:07.358
-So I know, we've only just
started talking again.

17:07.400 --> 17:15.440
But I'm about to have this
scan to do with my back.

17:15.480 --> 17:16.279
It's going to be fine.

17:16.319 --> 17:17.118
But--

17:17.160 --> 17:18.279
-Where are you?

17:23.598 --> 17:26.039
-It's like training
a goldfish.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.680
You were due in the studio
20 minutes ago.

17:27.720 --> 17:30.359
-Oh, for leg squats?

17:30.400 --> 17:32.279
I had six days to prepare.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.119
Don't you think that time would
have been better spent

17:34.160 --> 17:35.240
at the barre?

17:35.279 --> 17:36.160
-In terms of technique,
there's nothing I

17:36.200 --> 17:37.200
can do in six days.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.359
It's impossible.

17:38.400 --> 17:42.319
-Well, thank you for telling
me I'm hopeless.

17:42.359 --> 17:45.160
-You would be, if you were
starting from scratch.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.279
You've been dancing since before
you could walk, Kat.

17:47.319 --> 17:49.680
Your technique's in
there, somewhere.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.319
-See, that's where
you're wrong.

17:51.359 --> 17:54.160
I had every opportunity know
to ballet-butt kind.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.640
And I still never deserved
to be here.

17:56.680 --> 17:58.200
-At some point, you
might want to stop

17:58.240 --> 17:59.759
inventing excuses to quite.

17:59.799 --> 18:01.279
-Yeah, why is that?

18:01.319 --> 18:02.480
-You're not actually terrible.

18:20.279 --> 18:23.000
-So it's serious?

18:23.039 --> 18:25.279
-Don't know yet.

18:25.319 --> 18:28.440
-If it is, you can't dance.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.279
-I know.

18:29.319 --> 18:30.319
-No, it's just a competition.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.720
It's not worth hurting
yourself over.

18:31.759 --> 18:34.160
-I know, Christian.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.359
-I'm sorry.

18:38.519 --> 18:41.160
What's it feel like?

18:41.200 --> 18:43.359
-Scary.

18:43.400 --> 18:47.200
It's like, there's all
of these bricks

18:47.240 --> 18:49.799
inside of my back.

18:49.839 --> 18:53.279
It's probably a dodgy muscle.

18:53.319 --> 18:54.440
-Give it a couple
of days rest.

18:54.480 --> 18:57.160
And you'll top the
preliminaries.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.400
-Thanks.

19:03.599 --> 19:04.759
Hi.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.279
-Hey.

19:21.400 --> 19:24.400
-So at least one good thing
came out of this.

19:24.440 --> 19:27.119
-Sorry?

19:27.160 --> 19:29.559
Is that why you called
me down here?

19:29.599 --> 19:30.559
-No.

19:30.599 --> 19:34.160
Why didn't you call
Sammy or or Kat?

19:34.200 --> 19:36.759
-Because you were the one I
though of, who I always think

19:36.799 --> 19:37.880
of.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.240
-No, you can't guilt me
into getting back

19:39.279 --> 19:40.599
together with you.

19:40.640 --> 19:41.720
-I'm not trying to.

19:41.759 --> 19:43.160
-Because it's not gonna
happen, all right.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.359
I've already told you that.

19:50.160 --> 19:51.319
-Why not?

19:54.559 --> 19:56.400
-I've got your test results,
Tara, if you'd

19:56.440 --> 19:58.759
like to come inside.

19:58.799 --> 19:59.440
-Go.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.240
I'm just been dramatic.

20:01.279 --> 20:02.079
-I'll wait here.

20:02.119 --> 20:02.880
-No.

20:02.920 --> 20:04.119
Really, I'm fine on my own.

20:33.359 --> 20:35.720
-There's a crack running right
through your L5 pars

20:35.759 --> 20:36.680
articularis.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.160
That's one of the
bridging bones.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.680
It--

20:39.720 --> 20:42.599
it's causing some instability,
which means that your muscles

20:42.640 --> 20:44.039
are working overtime.

20:44.079 --> 20:48.079
Now, there's a fair bit of
activity happening around the

20:48.119 --> 20:49.480
crack, which makes
me think that the

20:49.519 --> 20:52.079
break happened recently.

20:52.119 --> 20:53.279
-I--

20:53.319 --> 20:54.720
I've broken my back?

20:54.759 --> 20:56.400
But I'm still walking.

20:56.440 --> 20:59.559
-Well, that's because you
haven't done any nerve damage.

20:59.599 --> 21:02.200
Now, I want to keep
you moving.

21:02.240 --> 21:04.640
Obviously, dancing is out
for quite awhile.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.240
But anything low
impact is good.

21:07.279 --> 21:08.359
Do you swim?

21:08.400 --> 21:09.720
TARA (OFFSCREEN): I can
control it higher.

21:09.759 --> 21:11.240
I can control it higher.

21:11.279 --> 21:13.720
-Medically, I'm in no hurry to
get you into surgery, because

21:13.759 --> 21:15.200
you're young.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.480
And it's better to see if the
bone just knits on its own.

21:17.519 --> 21:20.000
So lets get you back
here in six weeks.

21:20.039 --> 21:21.759
Obviously, no dancing between
now and then.

21:21.799 --> 21:23.720
SASKIA (OFFSCREEN): Oh, I
thought you were flexible.

21:23.759 --> 21:25.119
You want to go higher?

21:29.640 --> 21:33.240
-Tara, should I make that
appointment with your parents?

21:33.279 --> 21:35.079
-Uh no, that's OK.

21:35.119 --> 21:35.759
I can--

21:35.799 --> 21:36.400
I can set it up myself.

22:01.759 --> 22:03.400
TARA (OFFSCREEN): Sometimes
you don't know something's

22:03.440 --> 22:06.319
broken, until it's too
late to ever be put

22:06.359 --> 22:09.079
back together again.

22:09.119 --> 22:12.319
You can paper over the cracks,
but you know they're there,

22:12.359 --> 22:14.279
waiting to find you out.

22:14.319 --> 22:15.559
Nervous?

22:15.599 --> 22:18.759
So hungry my insides are
eating themselves.

22:18.799 --> 22:20.079
Hey, where's-- where's
Christian on

22:20.119 --> 22:23.160
this momentous occasion?

22:23.200 --> 22:26.079
-Hey, stop touching that.

22:26.119 --> 22:27.519
And thank you, ladies.

22:27.559 --> 22:28.720
Follow me.

22:32.200 --> 22:35.720
And next group come in,
please, and Katrina.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.599
-You're going to be amazing.

22:43.440 --> 22:44.400
-Good luck.

22:44.440 --> 22:45.599
-Thanks.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.000
-Don't worry.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.119
You haven't missed anything.

22:59.279 --> 23:02.079
-What did the doctor say?

23:02.119 --> 23:02.880
-You were right.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.319
It was just a muscle strain.
