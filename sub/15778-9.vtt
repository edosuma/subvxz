WEBVTT

00:04.607 --> 00:06.208
Mayday! Mayday!

00:06.209 --> 00:07.509
We have broken orbit!

00:07.510 --> 00:10.045
Repeat: Gargantua-1
has broken orbit!

00:10.046 --> 00:12.881
We've lost stabilizers!
Retrorockets are offline...

00:12.882 --> 00:15.908
and all failsafes
have...failed!

00:15.952 --> 00:18.452
Houston, do you copy?!

00:18.988 --> 00:23.325
We're done for, Anna.
Make peace with your higher power.

00:23.326 --> 00:25.427
There is one thing
we could try.

00:25.428 --> 00:28.226
Anna!
What are you doing?!

00:28.264 --> 00:30.764
Restrain yourself!

00:56.960 --> 00:59.461
Look at that! Clamoring
for a piece of that big phony.

00:59.462 --> 01:01.230
- That should be me up there.
- Really?

01:01.231 --> 01:04.533
- Why is that exactly?
- ls that supposed to be a joke?

01:04.534 --> 01:06.869
Whose space station
just saved the world?

01:06.870 --> 01:10.205
Manstrong's? No, mine.
He was just along for the ride.

01:10.206 --> 01:12.174
They might as well
give a medal to the seats...

01:12.175 --> 01:14.042
while they're pinning one
on Luck Rogers.

01:14.043 --> 01:15.544
Luck Rogers?

01:15.545 --> 01:18.480
Do you like that?
l almost said Flash-ln-the-Pan Gordon.

01:18.481 --> 01:21.850
- Glad you didn't.
- No pictures, son.

01:21.851 --> 01:24.351
Aw, gyp!

01:28.158 --> 01:30.658
Yeah! Join the bush club.

01:30.660 --> 01:33.288
- Samson.
- Houser.

01:40.503 --> 01:43.205
What's the matter?
Couldn't hack field work anymore...

01:43.206 --> 01:45.240
so they made you
White House hall monitor?

01:45.241 --> 01:47.576
You listen to me,
and you listen to me great, Samson.

01:47.577 --> 01:49.878
You may be a OSl,
but here, at the White House...

01:49.879 --> 01:55.009
you're just another civilian.
And l got my eyes on you.

01:55.185 --> 01:57.685
Both of you.

01:57.954 --> 02:00.055
- Friend of yours?
- We were in 'Nam together.

02:00.056 --> 02:02.758
Wait! You were,
like, ten during Vietnam.

02:02.759 --> 02:05.399
l didn't say during the war.

02:29.085 --> 02:30.285
There l was...

02:30.286 --> 02:32.454
grappling with the controls...

02:32.455 --> 02:36.191
of the proud and mighty
grande dame of the stars...

02:36.192 --> 02:38.894
as she burned up on re-entry.

02:38.895 --> 02:40.762
Let him have his moment.

02:40.763 --> 02:42.931
l'll have my turn,
as soon as the President...

02:42.932 --> 02:45.534
gets a load of a certain
little something something...

02:45.535 --> 02:46.969
l just happened to bring along.

02:46.970 --> 02:49.204
Tell me you didn't bring
that thing with you.

02:49.205 --> 02:51.874
Do you hate these things
as much as l do?

02:51.875 --> 02:53.909
Bunch of back-patting phonies!

02:53.910 --> 02:57.446
At least the wine is decent.
Keep it coming, honey!

02:57.447 --> 03:00.015
And the next thing l knew...

03:00.016 --> 03:04.419
l was waking up
in an army hospital in lranistan.

03:04.420 --> 03:08.490
Really? And that's all you remember
about the whole darned thing?

03:08.491 --> 03:10.991
Unfortunately, yes.

03:11.261 --> 03:15.697
l suppose it was that nasty bump
on the head l took in the crash.

03:15.698 --> 03:16.899
Manstrong?

03:16.900 --> 03:20.500
Colonel Bud Manstrong,
can you hear me?

03:20.637 --> 03:23.405
He's coming out of it.
The procedure was a success.

03:23.406 --> 03:26.174
- What about the chip?
- lt's not going anywhere.

03:26.175 --> 03:29.344
- Who's your friend over here?
- That's Brock Samson.

03:29.345 --> 03:32.915
- But he is no friend of mine.
- Too bad.

03:32.916 --> 03:36.952
Remember when l called to tell you
l'd been accosted on Gargantua-1?

03:36.953 --> 03:38.387
Of course l do!

03:38.388 --> 03:41.789
Oh, the tears! The sniffling!

03:41.824 --> 03:43.058
Yes, well...

03:43.059 --> 03:45.160
- He's the fellow who did it.
- Him?!

03:45.161 --> 03:49.064
So, why'd you beat my little boy up
and steal his girlfriend, blondie?

03:49.065 --> 03:51.833
- Oh, mother.
- Don't say too much, do you?

03:51.834 --> 03:55.804
Well, that's OK.
l like the strong and silent type.

03:55.805 --> 04:00.475
Ladies and gentlemen,
a toast to Colonel Bud Manstrong.

04:00.476 --> 04:04.212
A man of bravery, integrity,
and indomitable spirit...

04:04.213 --> 04:07.449
Oh, quit blowing smoke
up the boy's ass, Breyer.

04:07.450 --> 04:09.851
We all know
the real reason Bud's here.

04:09.852 --> 04:13.088
Your administration's
in the crapper, and you need...

04:13.089 --> 04:18.627
Mrs. Manstrong's little boyscout
on the team to polish that turd.

04:18.628 --> 04:21.128
To Bud!

04:22.732 --> 04:25.634
Mother! You can't talk
to the President like that.

04:25.635 --> 04:27.469
Well, l didn't vote for him!

04:27.470 --> 04:31.440
Listen, you just keep smiling,
and let your mother deal with the politics.

04:31.441 --> 04:33.508
He's embarrassed
by his mother.

04:33.509 --> 04:35.978
l breast-fed this one
till he lost his baby teeth...

04:35.979 --> 04:37.713
and he's embarrassed by me?

04:37.714 --> 04:38.747
Oh, mother!

04:38.748 --> 04:42.617
Prudish! Takes after his father,
the late Senator, God rest his soul.

04:42.618 --> 04:46.188
Man couldn't find a G-spot
without a Senate Subcommittee.

04:46.189 --> 04:48.423
- Oh, mother!
- Say, Bud!

04:48.424 --> 04:50.859
Or is it Budly? Budward?
What's Bud short for?

04:50.860 --> 04:52.928
Nothing. lt's just Bud.

04:52.929 --> 04:56.765
Yeah? Seeing as how you're
all tight with the big guy...

04:56.766 --> 04:58.800
because you broke my space station...

04:58.801 --> 05:02.704
l was wondering, if maybe,
you might put in a good word for me.

05:02.705 --> 05:06.375
Why don't you stop bothering my son,
you awful little nobody!

05:06.376 --> 05:09.378
Vultures, Buddy! Everyone's
gonna want a piece of you now...

05:09.379 --> 05:11.246
but you don't give 'em a thing.

05:11.247 --> 05:13.715
- Are you listening to me?!
- Yes, mother.

05:13.716 --> 05:15.517
Colonel Bud Manstrong...

05:15.518 --> 05:17.052
listen to your mother!

05:17.053 --> 05:19.553
Yes, mother.

05:25.628 --> 05:29.131
So, then the teacher said,
''Johnny Deeper!''...

05:29.132 --> 05:32.542
and so he stuck it in deeper!
What?!

05:34.270 --> 05:36.371
Seriously, lady!

05:36.372 --> 05:39.302
Knock it off!
l'm not into it!

05:40.877 --> 05:42.978
Smooth.

05:42.979 --> 05:46.281
Well, perhaps
we should call it a night, eh, folks?

05:46.282 --> 05:48.717
Thank y'all for coming,
and please, let's...

05:48.718 --> 05:52.254
let's have another round of applause
for the good Colonel.

05:52.255 --> 05:55.405
Come on.
Hands together. You, too.

05:57.260 --> 06:01.730
Why don't you come see me
privately in the Oval Office?

06:01.731 --> 06:04.032
You boys better come with me.

06:04.033 --> 06:05.901
But...Johnny Deeper!

06:05.902 --> 06:08.402
l'm terribly sorry, sir.

06:08.438 --> 06:11.202
Mother is...headstrong.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.808
She speaks her mind...

06:12.809 --> 06:15.410
and one has no choice
but to listen.

06:15.411 --> 06:18.547
Now don't you sweat it, Colonel Hangdog.
Your mother's right.

06:18.548 --> 06:21.249
My administration's
up to its ass in scandal.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.118
Hell, my VP
is under indictment.

06:23.119 --> 06:25.387
Anyways, l'm up
for re-election in November.

06:25.388 --> 06:27.355
And l don't have
a Chinaman's chance...

06:27.356 --> 06:29.691
unless l find me
a squeaky-clean running mate.

06:29.692 --> 06:32.260
Good luck in this town, though.
Cigar?

06:32.261 --> 06:36.595
Well, l don't usually partake,
but... Shucks!

06:36.632 --> 06:39.835
l'm not in an oxygen-rich
environment anymore!

06:39.836 --> 06:41.837
And how can one
decline an offer...

06:41.838 --> 06:45.706
from the President
of these United States?

06:45.741 --> 06:48.110
Wait. Not that one.

06:48.111 --> 06:49.878
l'm glad you feel that way, Bud...

06:49.879 --> 06:51.980
'cause l've got
a proposition for you.

06:51.981 --> 06:54.149
How'd you like
to be Vice President?

06:54.150 --> 06:55.650
Me?!

06:55.651 --> 06:57.986
Hell, yeah, you!
Who'd you think l'm talking about?

06:57.987 --> 06:59.688
You're a genuine hero, boy.

06:59.689 --> 07:01.790
The Bureau can't find
a damn thing on you...

07:01.791 --> 07:04.826
and, plus, you're a little bit
of the eye candy for the ladies.

07:04.827 --> 07:06.061
Speaking of which...

07:06.062 --> 07:10.031
- Take your pick.
- l'm not sure l follow you, sir.

07:10.032 --> 07:12.200
Any of my secretarial staff.

07:12.201 --> 07:14.669
Except the one in the blue dress
that smells like this.

07:14.670 --> 07:16.438
Dear Lord!

07:16.439 --> 07:19.541
That Phyllis' got my name
written all over her!

07:19.542 --> 07:20.742
Literally!

07:20.743 --> 07:23.545
l once wrote my name on the front
of her dress with the tip of my...

07:23.546 --> 07:27.048
Oh, no! l'm not hearing this!
l'm not hearing this!

07:27.049 --> 07:29.549
Good evening, sir!

07:33.556 --> 07:35.023
Cass?

07:35.024 --> 07:37.159
l'll take that blowjob now.

07:37.160 --> 07:39.594
Now, you boys
get yourselves some sleep...

07:39.595 --> 07:41.730
and don't you worry about a thing.

07:41.731 --> 07:45.500
l'm just gonna get some club soda
on these here stains before they set.

07:45.501 --> 07:46.801
All your troubles be over.

07:46.802 --> 07:50.005
l don't think club soda
can fix my problem.

07:50.006 --> 07:51.239
Child.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.608
Little club soda
get out most anything.

07:53.609 --> 07:56.645
- Wait! Don't leave!
- Dude, what is your damage?

07:56.646 --> 08:01.208
l saw something.
l think this place is...haunted.

08:01.250 --> 08:03.151
You're just
being superstitious.

08:03.152 --> 08:05.954
l am not!
Just extra-stitious.

08:05.955 --> 08:08.990
There's something wiggy going on.
l can feel it.

08:08.991 --> 08:11.159
lt's like...like we're being watched.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.961
Yeah, well...

08:12.962 --> 08:15.931
Lincoln bedroom is secure. Over.

08:17.767 --> 08:19.467
Slow down, Buddy.

08:19.468 --> 08:22.204
- Tell mama what happened.
- He was horrible, mother!

08:22.205 --> 08:25.874
That drooling, foul-mouthed,
pervert of a man...

08:25.875 --> 08:27.275
And crude!

08:27.276 --> 08:31.610
He said the most
disgraceful, ribaldrous things.

08:31.647 --> 08:33.982
Yeah, yeah.
Did he offer you Vice President?

08:33.982 --> 08:35.517
He did! And l told him...

08:35.518 --> 08:37.953
he could just take that job
and he could...

08:37.953 --> 08:40.054
he could stick...
he could take it...

08:40.056 --> 08:41.990
and he could stick the job in...

08:41.991 --> 08:44.259
l ran away!

08:44.260 --> 08:47.562
Then get back in there
and tell him you changed your mind.

08:47.563 --> 08:50.065
You want me to come with you
and show you how?

08:50.066 --> 08:51.833
Like when mama
held your pee-pee...

08:51.834 --> 08:53.702
and taught you
how to make your sisses?

08:53.703 --> 08:56.738
But, mother, you said
not to give anyone anything.

08:56.739 --> 08:59.107
Without getting
something in return, Buddy.

08:59.108 --> 09:00.909
You gotta make him pay, Buddy!

09:00.910 --> 09:02.077
But l don't want...

09:02.078 --> 09:06.538
Colonel Bud Manstrong,
listen to your mother.

09:06.582 --> 09:09.417
You will go back in there
and take this job...

09:09.418 --> 09:12.988
because it will put you next
to the most powerful man in the world.

09:12.989 --> 09:16.949
Now, be a man
and do what has to be done!

09:17.326 --> 09:18.426
Oh, come on, Brock.

09:18.427 --> 09:22.063
Just buy me five minutes.
l've been practicing my pitch all week.

09:22.064 --> 09:24.666
You just have no clue, do you?

09:24.667 --> 09:28.203
These aren't a bunch of fake pirates
or dinks in rubber butterfly suits, Doc.

09:28.204 --> 09:31.873
We're talking about
the United States Secret Service.

09:31.874 --> 09:35.977
Please. We'll both be off the hook when
he feasts his eyes on what l have to offer.

09:35.978 --> 09:39.147
This thing sells itself. lf it doesn't,
l can't afford to pay you this month.

09:39.148 --> 09:41.816
- You don't pay me.
- Why do you keep looking around?

09:41.817 --> 09:44.185
You're really afraid
of that Houser guy, aren't you?

09:44.186 --> 09:48.256
No. Manstrong's mom.
She's got a few drinks in her...

09:48.257 --> 09:52.994
and she tried to free
Nelson Mandela under the table.

09:52.995 --> 09:55.623
Say... OK, plan B.

09:55.665 --> 09:57.699
You throw the old broad a mercy lay...

09:57.700 --> 10:02.570
and in exchange
she sweet-talks the President for me.

10:03.572 --> 10:05.974
Nice scene
you made at dinner, Samson.

10:05.975 --> 10:09.444
Don't ever embarrass
the President like that again.

10:09.445 --> 10:11.913
l don't think the agency
could possibly demote you...

10:11.914 --> 10:13.982
any lower than they already have.

10:13.983 --> 10:17.619
But l hear there's an opening
in the mail room.

10:17.620 --> 10:20.120
Helsinki branch.

10:22.925 --> 10:25.727
l gotta take...
l got a call. l gotta take this.

10:25.728 --> 10:26.995
You know what, Doc?

10:26.996 --> 10:28.330
- You're on.
- Really?

10:28.331 --> 10:30.831
Plan A or plan B?

10:58.861 --> 11:01.361
Venture brothers!

11:01.564 --> 11:02.831
You must help me!

11:02.832 --> 11:07.202
Colonel Manstrong is going
to assassinate the President!

11:07.203 --> 11:11.753
Hank, wake up!
lt's the ghost of Abraham Lincoln!

11:13.042 --> 11:15.542
Who?

11:17.079 --> 11:18.513
Mr. President...

11:18.514 --> 11:23.014
my boy had a little
crisis of conscience earlier.

11:23.386 --> 11:25.153
But...well...

11:25.154 --> 11:27.654
Just do it, Buddy.

11:27.857 --> 11:30.792
Mr. President...

11:33.062 --> 11:35.430
Oh, my God!

11:35.431 --> 11:37.098
Hello, Dr. Venture.

11:37.099 --> 11:40.935
lf l could have a moment of your time,
l have something amazing to show you!

11:40.936 --> 11:45.440
Security breach! Security breach!
Damn it! Houser, where are you?!

11:45.441 --> 11:46.674
Thank God!

11:46.675 --> 11:48.843
Arrest this ma--
Hey, you're not my guy.

11:48.844 --> 11:50.512
Got about a minute, Doc.
Make it count.

11:50.513 --> 11:53.581
Hear me out, your Excellency!
lf you're anything like me...

11:53.582 --> 11:56.050
then you're super concerned
about security.

11:56.051 --> 11:59.220
Because in these uncertain times,
what could be more important...

11:59.221 --> 12:01.623
than the safety
of your family, your home...

12:01.624 --> 12:04.058
your country,
and your troops on the battlefield?

12:04.059 --> 12:06.995
Down in front, stick!
We were talking here!

12:06.996 --> 12:09.197
Allow me to formally
make your acquaintance...

12:09.198 --> 12:11.866
with the Venture Dome,
the world's first fully portable...

12:11.867 --> 12:14.035
battery-powered,
invisible force field.

12:14.036 --> 12:15.670
Gun!

12:15.671 --> 12:19.240
A microchip! Microchip!
lt's in the back of his head.

12:19.241 --> 12:21.242
His mother is using it to control him...

12:21.243 --> 12:24.345
and she's going to make him
assassinate the President!

12:24.346 --> 12:27.515
lt just sounds
a little far-fetched.

12:27.516 --> 12:29.684
Yeah. Thank you.
l'm glad you said it.

12:29.685 --> 12:33.021
What? Didn't either of you see
The Manchurian Candidate?

12:33.022 --> 12:35.390
Not even the remake with Denzel?
Come on!

12:35.391 --> 12:37.926
l've been dead
for seven score years and even...

12:37.927 --> 12:40.228
- Who is this guy?
- Abraham Lincoln!

12:40.229 --> 12:44.098
16th President of the United States!
Come on! You're kidding me!

12:44.099 --> 12:46.267
Yeah, didn't you learn
anything in bed?

12:46.268 --> 12:49.003
All right.
All right, how about this?

12:49.004 --> 12:50.972
l'm the $5.00 bill guy.

12:50.973 --> 12:52.874
You invented the $5.00 bill?

12:52.875 --> 12:54.909
Yes, Hank. Yes, l did.

12:54.910 --> 12:58.012
Dean, you seem
a little more on the ball here.

12:58.013 --> 13:00.915
- Help me stop Manstrong.
- Why do you need us?

13:00.916 --> 13:04.619
Because l'm immaterial.
Look at this. lt's a no-go.

13:04.620 --> 13:07.956
l need to possess one of your bodies
just for a little while...

13:07.957 --> 13:11.593
till l can stop him.
Will one of you do that for me?

13:11.594 --> 13:14.028
- For the Union?
- Not it!

13:14.029 --> 13:17.265
One, two, three...nine, ten. Jinx!
You owe me a coke!

13:17.266 --> 13:21.225
You are in for a world of suck, mister.

13:21.270 --> 13:23.771
Why are you men lollygagging?!

13:23.772 --> 13:25.607
- Lock this jackass up!
- They can't hear you.

13:25.608 --> 13:27.108
Sound-proof.

13:27.109 --> 13:30.044
- What the Sam-crazy...
- lt's a force field.

13:30.045 --> 13:33.081
- Of my own design.
- All right, turn it off, smart face.

13:33.082 --> 13:36.684
- You smashed the remote.
- Well, unplug it then. Whatever.

13:36.685 --> 13:39.254
What am l, an amateur?
lt's battery-powered.

13:39.255 --> 13:42.090
- Excellent for armies in the field.
- All in a package this small?

13:42.091 --> 13:44.292
- Stand back, sir.
- l wouldn't do that.

13:44.293 --> 13:46.828
- They're...nuclear batteries.
- Nucular?

13:46.829 --> 13:48.496
That's not actually
a word, but, yes!

13:48.497 --> 13:51.399
All right, people, we got a situation here.
l'm gonna need troops...

13:51.400 --> 13:54.435
Not gonna work either.
Jams radios, phones, intercoms...

13:54.436 --> 13:56.070
Only on the deluxe model, of course.

13:56.071 --> 13:58.506
So, how the hell
are we supposed to get out of here?

13:58.507 --> 14:01.743
Well, it'll run out of juice
on it's own in about...

14:01.744 --> 14:03.611
What's the half-life
on cobalt again?

14:03.612 --> 14:06.843
- 5.24 years.
- 5.24 years.

14:06.882 --> 14:09.382
Give or take.

14:13.956 --> 14:17.725
Yes, yes. Of course, General.
You can count on me.

14:17.726 --> 14:20.595
Sorry, hon. Gotta work tonight.
National emergency.

14:20.596 --> 14:22.263
Little man need Ned help?

14:22.264 --> 14:24.632
- Ned protect little man.
- No, no, Ned. Thank you.

14:24.633 --> 14:28.670
- l won't be in any danger.
- Ned love little man!

14:28.671 --> 14:31.105
OK! A little too tight, Ned!

14:31.106 --> 14:33.608
Ned give little man the brain vein.

14:33.609 --> 14:35.944
lt's OK, Ned.
You ready, Captain?

14:35.945 --> 14:37.879
Gassed up
and on the runway, Chairman.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.380
Don't wait up, hon.

14:48.190 --> 14:49.424
Dude! What the dilly?!

14:49.425 --> 14:50.925
Did it work?
What happened?

14:50.926 --> 14:53.027
Honest Abe's a mo,
that's what happened!

14:53.028 --> 14:55.296
Sorry! Sorry!
What came over me?

14:55.297 --> 14:58.566
l was just a bit overwhelming
having a body again.

14:58.567 --> 15:02.003
All those hormones!
All right.

15:02.037 --> 15:06.541
Just let me try this again.
l'm ready for it this time.

15:06.542 --> 15:09.611
- Who's Triana, by the way?
- Just get in.

15:09.612 --> 15:12.380
- And no funny business.
- Yes, already.

15:12.381 --> 15:14.549
Like you boys
never experimented.

15:14.550 --> 15:16.618
Dean!

15:16.619 --> 15:18.486
There. You're safe now, sir.

15:18.487 --> 15:21.623
- l've secured a perimeter.
- That's great, Houser.

15:21.624 --> 15:24.325
You hear that, people?
Nobody crosses this line.

15:24.326 --> 15:27.028
You think you could
maybe not smoke in here?

15:27.029 --> 15:29.964
- Fine.
- Thank you.

15:31.233 --> 15:33.668
lt's still going.

15:33.669 --> 15:36.004
Now the other one's caught. Nice one.

15:36.005 --> 15:39.173
Everything you touch
turns to suck. lt's official.

15:39.174 --> 15:41.476
Oh, no!
They called my brother?

15:41.477 --> 15:43.211
Could this be
any more embarrassing?

15:43.212 --> 15:47.215
Yeah, all right, hi.
l see you. Go to hell.

15:47.216 --> 15:49.317
Well, Doc, can you
break it down or what?

15:49.318 --> 15:53.354
Well, l could try to generate
an artificial Einstein-Rosen bridge...

15:53.355 --> 15:57.825
but l can't guarantee we wouldn't be
sucked into another dimension.

15:57.826 --> 16:01.929
Well! Hey, there, nephew!
What are you doing?

16:01.930 --> 16:03.765
That little bastard!

16:03.766 --> 16:06.266
How'd he do that?

16:08.604 --> 16:10.772
- Gotta go.
- What are you trying to do, Dean?

16:10.773 --> 16:12.507
We're helping
our new ghost pal.

16:12.508 --> 16:13.941
Ain't that something!

16:13.942 --> 16:16.544
l wish my boy
had that kind of creativity.

16:16.545 --> 16:19.047
Colonel Manstrong's going
to assassinate the President!

16:19.048 --> 16:21.749
lt's not really his fault though.
His mom's controlling him.

16:21.750 --> 16:24.585
Don't give me that psycho-babble, son.
After a certain age...

16:24.586 --> 16:27.822
a man needs to take responsibility
for his own actions.

16:27.823 --> 16:29.090
- OK.
- Sure!

16:29.091 --> 16:31.325
Maybe if l had hugged
my thick-headed son more...

16:31.326 --> 16:35.263
he wouldn't have started them fires
or stolen all that lacrosse equipment...

16:35.264 --> 16:37.765
but, damn it,
sometimes they're just bad apples.

16:37.766 --> 16:39.634
Damnation!

16:39.635 --> 16:43.204
Force field! l didn't see
that one coming. Sorry, Dean.

16:43.205 --> 16:44.706
OK, OK. New plan.

16:44.707 --> 16:46.407
Well, you just KO'ed Uncle Sam.

16:46.408 --> 16:48.876
Why can't you just do that
to an astronaut and his mom?

16:48.877 --> 16:50.778
That's not Uncle Sam, it's me!

16:50.779 --> 16:52.914
Couldn't lay a glove on it
if it weren't.

16:52.915 --> 16:56.751
l can only move things
in the material world that bear my image.

16:56.752 --> 16:59.020
Wait! That penny
in your pocket, Dean.

16:59.021 --> 17:01.556
l was able to get that through
the force field. That's it!

17:01.557 --> 17:04.058
We build a gun
made out of pennies!

17:04.059 --> 17:06.160
Exactly! Wait, no!
That's insane.

17:06.161 --> 17:07.627
But l have another idea.

17:07.628 --> 17:12.165
Boys, l need $5.00 bills.
Scores of them! Ten score at least.

17:12.166 --> 17:13.601
How are we gonna
find that many?

17:13.602 --> 17:16.671
How, how? What are you, an owl?
He can make them with his magic.

17:16.672 --> 17:20.074
For the last time, Hank,
l'm a ghost, not a genie.

17:20.075 --> 17:22.575
You two must find a way!

17:22.810 --> 17:26.012
Wait! Does it matter
if it's the new fives or the old ones?

17:26.013 --> 17:30.114
l prefer the new ones.
But whatever! Go, go!

17:52.775 --> 17:56.905
Score! Thank you,
Ambassador Mumbattu.

17:58.213 --> 18:02.617
Well, l promised my wife and Jesus
l wouldn't anymore.

18:02.618 --> 18:06.058
But things being
as they are, well...

18:06.355 --> 18:08.956
Thank you, no, sir.
l'm on duty.

18:08.957 --> 18:10.558
- Perimeter!
- Do something.

18:10.559 --> 18:12.393
Am l the only one that cares about...

18:12.394 --> 18:14.695
Am l the only one
that cares about perimeters?

18:14.696 --> 18:17.031
'Cause l'm starting to think l am.

18:17.032 --> 18:19.300
And l don't...and l don't like it.

18:19.301 --> 18:22.668
Mother's had a bit too much already.

18:22.704 --> 18:25.824
- How about you?
- l don't drink.

18:26.041 --> 18:29.135
- l'm sorry.
- For what?

18:29.178 --> 18:32.280
Lieutenant Baldavich.
l didn't know she was...

18:32.281 --> 18:34.315
your girlfriend.
That wasn't cool.

18:34.316 --> 18:36.317
Mr. Samson...

18:36.318 --> 18:39.954
Gargantua-1 was
an orbiting metal Eden...

18:39.955 --> 18:44.325
until you sullied it
with your Brando-esque sensuality...

18:44.326 --> 18:47.128
and your non-regulation apparel.

18:47.129 --> 18:50.998
Sorry doesn't quite make up
for deflowering my Eve.

18:50.999 --> 18:54.368
Come on. Enough with
the boyscout act.

18:54.369 --> 18:57.405
You two were alone
on that thing for years.

18:57.406 --> 19:00.074
Now, don't tell me
you never hit that.

19:00.075 --> 19:02.805
What?!
l never struck her!

19:02.845 --> 19:05.980
How dare you
even imply that l did!

19:05.981 --> 19:08.643
l loved her!

19:12.821 --> 19:15.321
This ain't good.

19:15.624 --> 19:18.855
FDR.
Now, he was a real President.

19:18.894 --> 19:20.728
l loved to watch him sleep.

19:20.729 --> 19:23.364
Weight of the world
on his little polio shoulders.

19:23.365 --> 19:25.900
The Depression, World War ll.

19:25.901 --> 19:29.637
He slept like a baby.
Now, that is a clear conscience.

19:29.638 --> 19:33.541
This Breyer guy, though,
he's the worst President l've ever seen.

19:33.542 --> 19:35.576
Then why am l wasting
my time with this?

19:35.577 --> 19:38.880
Honestly? l'm kind of hoping
to earn my wings on this deal.

19:38.881 --> 19:42.483
So, we're not just
saving the President.

19:42.484 --> 19:46.153
- We're saving you, too!
- My Lincoln sense is tingling!

19:46.154 --> 19:48.956
Manstrong's making his move!
Hurry, boys!

19:48.957 --> 19:50.291
Svengali!

19:50.292 --> 19:53.060
No, no!
Look, this is not what it looks like.

19:53.061 --> 19:56.497
First Anna, now my mother?!

19:56.531 --> 19:58.766
Have you no shame, you...

19:58.767 --> 20:01.168
You mandingo!

20:01.169 --> 20:03.671
OK, get up! We're doing this!

20:03.672 --> 20:06.607
You and me, Samson,
right now! Let's go!

20:06.608 --> 20:09.610
Come on, man. You know
l'm just gonna beat you stupid.

20:09.611 --> 20:11.846
- l've done it before.
- With a sucker punch.

20:11.847 --> 20:15.616
This time, school-yard rules.
No cheap shots.

20:15.617 --> 20:17.685
This is ridiculous.
Your mother just...

20:17.686 --> 20:20.186
No mothers!

20:22.958 --> 20:24.191
What?!

20:24.192 --> 20:26.812
Here comes the Rail Splitter!

20:27.162 --> 20:28.829
What the hell's going on now?!

20:28.830 --> 20:30.531
What? Did my brother make that?

20:30.532 --> 20:34.101
Mr. President, this man's
an assassin programmed to kill you!

20:34.102 --> 20:36.771
There's a microchip
in his brain. Look!

20:36.772 --> 20:39.006
Perimeter, sir! Perimeter!

20:39.007 --> 20:41.507
Damn it! Not again!

20:42.044 --> 20:48.074
Stop bothering my son!

20:48.116 --> 20:49.684
Did l graze you, Niblets?

20:49.685 --> 20:52.820
You did it, boys.
You saved the President.

20:52.821 --> 20:54.789
Go, Team Venture!

20:54.790 --> 20:58.392
You're supposed to be a doctor.
ls my Buddy gonna be OK?

20:58.393 --> 21:00.127
Wait a minute. l recognize this.

21:00.128 --> 21:04.838
lt's a Venture industries microchip.
Hang on a sec.

21:06.168 --> 21:08.035
lt's the mother board
from Gargantua-1 .

21:08.036 --> 21:11.005
Anna! What are you doing?!

21:11.039 --> 21:13.174
Restrain yourself!

21:13.175 --> 21:15.343
lf we are going to die...

21:15.344 --> 21:19.384
l want to go out with a bang,
as they say.

21:22.985 --> 21:26.187
l knew it!
Told you this clown was no hero!

21:26.188 --> 21:29.857
He just blacked out
in the middle of a hand-job.

21:29.858 --> 21:32.426
Someone's playing
with his Lincoln logs.

21:32.427 --> 21:37.694
Oh, my God!
lt's full of stars!

21:38.834 --> 21:41.334
Penny for his thoughts.

22:08.530 --> 22:11.766
You're...still here.
Shouldn't you have crossed over?

22:11.767 --> 22:15.436
Apparently, stopping my bodyguard
from beating up a repressed masturbator...

22:15.437 --> 22:17.938
isn't enough to get you
into heaven these days. Go figure.

22:17.939 --> 22:20.874
You're one to judge, Rusty.

22:20.909 --> 22:24.378
l seem to remember a certain
fast-handed little redhead...

22:24.379 --> 22:28.149
sleeping in the Lincoln bedroom
a score and a half years back.

22:28.150 --> 22:31.318
- All right.
- Not that you did much sleeping.

22:31.319 --> 22:32.420
OK.

22:32.421 --> 22:34.555
l...never would
have thought that.

22:34.556 --> 22:37.792
Don't know why you people
gotta complicate everything.

22:37.793 --> 22:41.429
l told y'all, a little club soda
fix most everything.

22:41.430 --> 22:44.024
That's good chowder!
