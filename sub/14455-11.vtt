Narrator: Coming up...
Check this out.

00:13.300 --> 00:16.133
...what's got Sal crushing it?

00:18.000 --> 00:21.200
Why is Joe's underwear
going overboard?

00:23.667 --> 00:26.400
And which losing Joker
will be sent to the meat market

00:26.400 --> 00:27.867
in tonight's punishment?

00:27.867 --> 00:30.333
Hungry?

00:30.333 --> 00:32.933
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

00:32.933 --> 00:35.700
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:35.700 --> 00:37.300
Murr:
I want my mommy!

00:39.300 --> 00:42.133
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

00:42.133 --> 00:43.600
Joe: Larry!

00:47.700 --> 00:49.133
Today,
we've been "hired"

00:49.133 --> 00:50.900
to assemble some
new office furniture.

00:50.900 --> 00:52.833
And while working
alongside strangers

00:52.833 --> 00:54.767
who have been hired
to do the same thing,

00:54.767 --> 00:57.633
we'll have to do and say
whatever the other guys tell us.

00:57.633 --> 01:00.067
-And if you refuse --
-You're screwed!

01:00.067 --> 01:01.233
You're screwed.

01:01.233 --> 01:04.900
**

01:04.900 --> 01:06.567
-Here we go.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.833
-Anna.
-Anna. Sal.

01:07.833 --> 01:09.300
Hey, nice to meet you.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.733
"I met Bon Jovi
last week."

01:11.733 --> 01:13.467
I met Bon Jovi
last week, actually.

01:13.467 --> 01:14.833
Oh! Awesome.

01:14.833 --> 01:17.133
"Jon Bon Jovi smelled
like sandalwood."

01:17.133 --> 01:18.567
Speaking of which,
Jon Bon Jovi

01:18.567 --> 01:20.267
smelled like
sandalwood.

01:20.267 --> 01:22.067
-Yeah.

01:22.067 --> 01:23.533
"And he feels like
he works out."

01:23.533 --> 01:26.733
And he -- he --

01:26.733 --> 01:28.967
He actually feels like
he works out, you know?

01:28.967 --> 01:30.700
It's, like, we got together
for a picture.

01:30.700 --> 01:33.133
-I had my arm around him.
-Right.

01:33.133 --> 01:34.667
Very muscular guy.

01:34.667 --> 01:36.933
-Nice.

01:36.933 --> 01:38.167
Oh, this pops right in.

01:38.167 --> 01:41.267
Sal, look up at her
and say "Rice?"

01:43.600 --> 01:45.333
"

01:45.333 --> 01:46.767
"How much rice?"
What?

01:46.767 --> 01:49.100
Annoyed, say "How much rice
could you eat in one sitting?"

01:49.100 --> 01:50.933
How much rice could you eat
in one sitting?

01:50.933 --> 01:53.900
Oh. Um, I don't know.
Probably like that much.

01:53.900 --> 01:54.933
Really? Yeah.

01:54.933 --> 01:57.067
Yeah, it's filling.

01:57.067 --> 02:00.100
"You know who you look like?
My daughter's gyno."

02:03.667 --> 02:05.467
-He can't say that.
-Ohh.

02:05.467 --> 02:07.567
-He'll get to it.
-Oh!

02:07.567 --> 02:08.800
Joe:
Those boxes are empty.

02:08.800 --> 02:11.167
Could you just go and swan-dive
into one of them?

02:11.167 --> 02:15.067
**

02:15.067 --> 02:16.933
-Well --

02:20.067 --> 02:21.533
Check this out.

02:28.867 --> 02:31.167
Oh, my God.
He disappeared completely.

02:31.167 --> 02:33.167
That's exactly
what I wanted.

02:33.167 --> 02:35.300
-Little help, little help!
-Little help!

02:35.300 --> 02:36.833
I certainly hope
you didn't just crush

02:36.833 --> 02:40.433
all their light fixtures.

02:40.433 --> 02:43.067
-"Anna."
-Anna.

02:43.067 --> 02:45.833
"You look like
my daughter's gyno."

02:45.833 --> 02:49.300
Sal:  You look like
my daughter's gyno.

02:49.300 --> 02:50.333
Yeah.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.067
-Yes!
-Wow.

02:54.067 --> 02:56.600
-"Hey, Anna."
-Hey, Anna.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.067
"You're on
a hidden-camera TV show

02:58.067 --> 03:00.067
called 'Impractical Jokers.'"

03:00.067 --> 03:01.867
You're on a hidden-camera
television show

03:01.867 --> 03:04.767
-called "Impractical Jokers."

03:04.767 --> 03:07.067
Me and my three friends
since high school

03:07.067 --> 03:09.067
have a show on truTV.

03:11.667 --> 03:12.900
I'm wearing an earpiece,

03:12.900 --> 03:14.800
and my friends
tell me what to do.

03:17.867 --> 03:19.633
All right.
Oh, I'm Joe.

03:19.633 --> 03:20.967
Randy?
Good to see you, pal.

03:20.967 --> 03:23.733
Joe, get
your ass crack out.

03:23.733 --> 03:25.433
Got that --
The box looks like it's empty.

03:25.433 --> 03:27.467
It looks like all
the pieces are out.

03:27.467 --> 03:29.567
This is --
Yeah, this is the last.

03:31.233 --> 03:33.333
You got to get him
to look at it.

03:33.333 --> 03:35.900
Do we put them this way?

03:39.567 --> 03:41.300
How is he not looking?

03:41.300 --> 03:43.600
One, two --
Got four here.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.233
All right. I think he noticed.
He saw it on --

03:46.233 --> 03:47.900
He saw it in the smile.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.500
I can't tell
where the hole is.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.233
But it is the hole.
All right, the hole is there.

03:51.233 --> 03:53.667
-Oh.
-Spin, spin.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.067
There's the hole.
I found the hole.

04:01.067 --> 04:02.733
No, this is
the ass end of it.

04:02.733 --> 04:04.300
I really want to get
this thing right.

04:04.300 --> 04:05.900
I'm super anal
about this stuff.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.233
**

04:12.767 --> 04:14.633
Sal: Walk back and forth
through the shelf.

04:14.633 --> 04:17.533
Those here. Right.

04:17.533 --> 04:19.267
Four --
One, two, three, four.

04:19.267 --> 04:22.067
Dude, just keep
walking through it.

04:22.067 --> 04:24.733
Right. That way
those ends meet.

04:26.733 --> 04:30.633
Murr:
It's like one of my cats.

04:30.633 --> 04:34.133
Keep your arms up
like a chicken.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.067
-I don't know.

04:45.900 --> 04:48.067
Look at this set-up --
both bald.

04:50.633 --> 04:54.233
-I know. Me, too.
-He's already complaining.

04:54.233 --> 04:55.833
Q: Murr, you got
your phone on you?

04:55.833 --> 04:57.500
Oh, it's ringing.
"Oh, I got to take this.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.800
It's Sarah Michelle Gellar."

04:59.800 --> 05:02.100
Uh, it's Sarah
Michelle Gellar.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.367
Sarah! Hi!

05:06.867 --> 05:08.367
"Oh, you butt"

05:08.367 --> 05:09.833
Oh, you butt-dialed me.

05:13.467 --> 05:14.567
Unless this thing
is bent.

05:14.567 --> 05:16.933
Bump heads, bump heads.

05:16.933 --> 05:18.433
Yeah, hold on a sec.

05:18.433 --> 05:20.267
Oh! I'm sorry.

05:20.267 --> 05:22.233
-You're okay, bud.
-Excuse me.

05:22.233 --> 05:24.633
"Now, whose sweat
is that?"

05:24.633 --> 05:25.900
Was it your sweat
or my sweat?

05:25.900 --> 05:27.700
I can't tell.
It's your sweat. Got it.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.167
Turn to him
and go "Grilled cheese,

05:32.167 --> 05:34.067
tomato, bacon, whole wheat."

05:34.067 --> 05:36.167
-Yeah.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.100
Grilled cheese, tomato,
bacon, whole wheat.

05:40.100 --> 05:42.867
"Cut the crusts off."

05:42.867 --> 05:46.633
Just cut the crusts off.

05:46.633 --> 05:49.367
"Whenever you're ready. Sandwich
isn't gonna make itself."

05:51.600 --> 05:52.833
I mean, whenever
you're ready,

05:52.833 --> 05:55.067
'cause the sandwich
is not gonna make itself.

05:57.867 --> 05:59.867
Joe: Say, "You know what?
I think I know what to do here."

05:59.867 --> 06:01.267
You know, I think
I know what to do.

06:01.267 --> 06:03.300
Now go stand in between
some boxes facing the wall.

06:03.300 --> 06:05.800
I think
I know what to do.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.767
Take your phone out.

06:07.767 --> 06:10.733
"

06:10.733 --> 06:13.633
"Did you ever assemble
the Luxembourg from IKEA?"

06:13.633 --> 06:16.367
Have you ever assembled
a Luxembourg from IKEA?

06:19.067 --> 06:20.333
She hung up.

06:22.400 --> 06:26.967
Q, you've never built
furniture in your life.

06:30.067 --> 06:32.467
Which fasteners
get that first two together.

06:32.467 --> 06:35.200
-Right.
-Sorry.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.800
Sal: "Oh, I see --
I see what this is.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.233
I watched one of these
slowly tip over

06:38.233 --> 06:40.067
onto my wife's kids once."

06:40.067 --> 06:43.233
I saw one of these
slowly tip over

06:43.233 --> 06:44.933
onto my wife's kids
one time.

06:44.933 --> 06:46.367
-Oh, that's...
-Yeah.

06:46.367 --> 06:48.667
...incredibly awful.

06:48.667 --> 06:50.633
-All right. Let's get started.
-Grab the bottom of his pants,

06:50.633 --> 06:52.067
tug at them,
and go "Snake bite!"

06:52.067 --> 06:53.433
-All right. Let's get started.
-Grab the bottom of his pants,

06:58.333 --> 07:00.300
-Now!
-Oh!

07:00.300 --> 07:02.300
Snake bite.

07:02.300 --> 07:04.267
Oh, that's so weird.

07:04.267 --> 07:05.967
-Yeah.

07:05.967 --> 07:08.633
-"I started a vlog."
-So, I started, like, a vlog.

07:08.633 --> 07:10.567
"It's called 'Work Hard,
Date Harder.'"

07:10.567 --> 07:14.267
It's called
"Work Hard, Date Harder."

07:14.267 --> 07:17.833
"I was gonna actually do
an entry for it right now."

07:17.833 --> 07:20.633
Gonna do an entry
right now.

07:20.633 --> 07:22.333
Hey, everybody!
This is, uh, Brian

07:22.333 --> 07:24.433
from "Work Hard, Date Harder."

07:24.433 --> 07:27.133
And you know I'm mainly known
for dating a lot, guys,

07:27.133 --> 07:28.967
but today I've got
something special --

07:28.967 --> 07:31.067
I'm working hard!

07:31.067 --> 07:32.967
Wh!

07:32.967 --> 07:35.467
Here with my man J-Dawg!
J-Dawg.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.733
That's gonna get,
like, a lot of views.

07:39.733 --> 07:41.233
Q, do another vlog.

07:41.233 --> 07:43.633
All right --
Yo, yo, yo!

07:43.633 --> 07:45.067
It's back to "Work Hard" --

07:45.067 --> 07:48.333
Yeah -- "Date Harder"!

07:48.333 --> 07:51.500
Yo, man, I got my peep
J-Train right over here.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.200
My buddy knows
how to do everything

07:53.200 --> 07:54.600
except, what?

07:54.600 --> 07:56.967
Snake bite!

07:56.967 --> 07:59.200
What's that?

07:59.200 --> 08:01.700
-"Snake bite"!
-Snake bite!

08:03.367 --> 08:05.067
He's running!
-Snake bite!

08:07.167 --> 08:08.900
Narrator:
All the Jokers were handy men,

08:08.900 --> 08:11.533
so they're safe
from the loser board.

08:11.533 --> 08:12.667
Today, we are teaming up

08:12.667 --> 08:15.067
trying to get tighty-whiteys
into shopper's bags.

08:15.067 --> 08:17.267
One guy will be talking to
a stranger on the ground floor

08:17.267 --> 08:19.700
while his partner is trying
to toss these undies

08:19.700 --> 08:22.367
into the person's bag
from the top floor.

08:22.367 --> 08:24.900
The team who sinks the most
tighty-whiteys the bag wins.

08:24.900 --> 08:27.867
Hey, are we looking at ourselves
and seeing what we just said?

08:27.867 --> 08:32.167
**

08:32.167 --> 08:34.600
-Ahh, I'm ready for this.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.333
Murr: Here we go, Q.
Dude, can you do me a solid?

08:36.333 --> 08:38.233
Can you get a photo of me?
Do you mind? Thank you, man.

08:38.233 --> 08:40.333
Here, let me -- Let's toss this.
Sal: Here we go, here we go.

08:40.333 --> 08:42.333
Yeah, step forward a little bit.
Step forward a little bit.

08:42.333 --> 08:43.600
I want to get
a little closer --

08:44.700 --> 08:46.100
Oh, wait. Hold on. Count --

08:46.100 --> 08:47.967
Count to three.

08:47.967 --> 08:51.967
The parachute didn't open.
That's why I don't skydive.

08:51.967 --> 08:53.900
Ah, ah -- Yeah!

08:53.900 --> 08:55.533
-It's in!
-That counts. That's one.

08:55.533 --> 08:56.700
Oh, that's not bad!

08:56.700 --> 08:58.633
Mark.

08:58.633 --> 09:00.100
Oh, too far.

09:00.100 --> 09:02.533
I'm gonna, like, kind of do,
like, one of these things, okay?

09:06.067 --> 09:09.267
All right. Thanks, man.
I appreciate it.

09:09.267 --> 09:11.500
The guy thinks nothing
of the underwear,

09:11.500 --> 09:12.533
nothing.

09:12.533 --> 09:14.533
-I got one.
-You got one!

09:14.533 --> 09:17.233
This is it. There's a cluster
of bags right there.

09:17.233 --> 09:18.633
Dude, do you mind
if I ask you a favor?

09:18.633 --> 09:20.300
Can you take a selfie of me?

09:20.300 --> 09:21.667
Ohh.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.233
Murr: I want, like, this in
the background behind me.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.067
Step one step closer.

09:29.933 --> 09:31.633
He looks like a magician,
you know,

09:31.633 --> 09:33.500
when they keep pulling the --
pulling the stuff out.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.767
He's pulling
out the scarf.

09:35.767 --> 09:38.200
Come on! Hold on --
Let me see this.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.767
They're too tangled!

09:39.767 --> 09:41.900
-One, two, three.
-Oh.

09:41.900 --> 09:44.133
-Ohh.
-Ohh!

09:44.133 --> 09:48.433
Two
Step one step closer.

09:48.433 --> 09:49.767
-Ah! That's one!

09:49.767 --> 09:51.367
-It counts as one.
-One step -- Here.

09:51.367 --> 09:53.767
Like two steps closer.

09:53.767 --> 09:56.567
The bag is surrounded
by tighty-whiteys.

09:56.567 --> 09:58.567
Come on!

09:58.567 --> 10:01.233
-Come on.
your bed.

10:01.233 --> 10:03.200
This isn't
precision equipment.

10:05.167 --> 10:07.233
-Ohh!
-Oh, come on!

10:07.233 --> 10:09.667
-I'm out.
-No problem.

10:09.667 --> 10:11.600
Thanks so much.
I really appreciate it.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.267
-We got two points.
-That was bad.

10:13.267 --> 10:15.733
It's not funny.

10:15.733 --> 10:18.033
Murr: Joe's up top,
and Sal's down low.

10:18.033 --> 10:19.733
Joe, are you loaded up
with panties?

10:19.733 --> 10:23.033
As always, I got
a plethora of undies.

10:23.033 --> 10:25.433
Excuse me, Miss.
Can you take a photo of me?

10:25.433 --> 10:28.700
I want to send them
to my family.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.200
Oh, it's okay,
it's okay.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.800
-Okay.
-Oh!

10:39.800 --> 10:41.433
He got it! He got it!

10:43.667 --> 10:45.233
It's something
on a parachute.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.000
Q: You got to admire
Joe's tenacity.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.500
There you go. Oh!

10:52.500 --> 10:54.033
Oh, so close.

10:54.033 --> 10:57.733
Thank you. I appreciate that.
Thank you so much.

10:57.733 --> 11:00.800
I don't know. It looks like --
It looks like --

11:00.800 --> 11:02.900
I should try
I'm gonna try and catch one.

11:02.900 --> 11:06.067
Go ahead, throw another one.
I'll try and g--

11:06.067 --> 11:07.267
-Go ahead.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.433
Try one, try one.
You got to get it in the bag.

11:08.433 --> 11:09.933
-Got to get it in the bag.

11:09.933 --> 11:11.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dude, why didn't we
think of that?

11:11.700 --> 11:13.067
-We were outfoxed.
-He made it into a game.

11:13.067 --> 11:14.700
Heads up.

11:14.700 --> 11:16.767
Oh, there it is,
there it is. Yes!

11:19.767 --> 11:20.933
That's a champion.

11:20.933 --> 11:23.167
They played the game,
and they played us.

11:23.167 --> 11:25.333
Guys, that's what you
call a technicality.

11:25.333 --> 11:28.833
The loophole is closed. You
can't enlist them to catch it.

11:28.833 --> 11:30.133
Deal.

11:30.133 --> 11:32.200
Excuse me,
can you take a picture of me?

11:32.200 --> 11:34.200
I just want to get
that store in the background.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.933
Excuse me,
can g!

11:35.933 --> 11:37.200
full of panties.

11:39.233 --> 11:40.900
It's a numbers game, boys.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.967
Oh, Joe, don't do it.

11:42.967 --> 11:45.800
It's about to rain undies
on this lady.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.133
Like this?

11:48.633 --> 11:50.067
Not a single one!

11:50.067 --> 11:51.933
-Not one!
-Not a single one!

11:51.933 --> 11:53.067
Okay, wait.

11:53.067 --> 11:55.667
Maybe like this?

11:55.667 --> 11:58.267
-Ah!
-Ah!

11:58.267 --> 11:59.500
Damn it.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.200
You guys got to think
like a winner.

12:02.767 --> 12:05.467
Narrator: Q and Murr got
their panties in a twist,

12:05.467 --> 12:08.067
so they're first up
on the loser board.

12:08.067 --> 12:09.533
Today, we're shopping
at Food Bazaar

12:09.533 --> 12:11.600
mistaking strangers
for someone we know.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.067
While approaching
"someone we know,"

12:14.067 --> 12:15.533
we'll be given a line to say.

12:15.533 --> 12:16.867
When that shopper turns around,

12:16.867 --> 12:19.200
we'll then be told
"how we know them."

12:19.200 --> 12:21.067
If you refuse to say
any of the crazy things

12:21.067 --> 12:22.733
we tell you to,
you lose.

12:22.733 --> 12:27.533
Narrator: It's Q and Joe
in a Joker Vs. Joker challenge.

12:27.533 --> 12:29.533
Q: Go up to this woman.

12:29.533 --> 12:32.967
"Let's bounce. This poop dam's
about to burst."

12:32.967 --> 12:36.267
All right, let's bounce. This
poop dam's about to burst. Oh.

12:36.267 --> 12:37.900
"Ooh! I thought
you were my wife."

12:37.900 --> 12:40.100
I'm sorry. I thought --
I thought you were my wife.

12:40.100 --> 12:41.433
I thought you were my wife.

12:41.433 --> 12:42.633
I'm sorry about that.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.800
Q:
She is staring at you.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.400
Honey?

12:51.400 --> 12:54.467
She has to laugh.

12:54.467 --> 12:55.933
Honey?

13:01.233 --> 13:04.800
Joe, say to this guy
"Nice yams."

13:04.800 --> 13:06.767
Nice yams.

13:06.767 --> 13:08.267
"Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were a lady."

13:08.267 --> 13:10.367
Oh. I thought
you were a --

13:10.367 --> 13:11.600
I thought
you were a lady.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.733
I said "Nice yams" to you!

13:14.733 --> 13:16.833
Oh, it's too funny.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.367
'Cause you got the titties!
Oh.

13:25.733 --> 13:29.200
Sweet potatoes.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.233
This is like
"Twilight Zone" weird.

13:31.233 --> 13:33.967
I said "Nice yams"
to you! Oh!

13:33.967 --> 13:35.267
Have a good day.

13:37.467 --> 13:39.067
Sal: Here we go.

13:39.067 --> 13:42.100
"You got that weed,
you got that weed?"

13:42.100 --> 13:45.367
You got that weed?
You got that weed?

13:45.367 --> 13:47.767
"I-I'm sorry, I thought
you were my 'doctor.'"

13:47.767 --> 13:50.933
Oh, I thought -- I'm sorry.
I thought you were my "doctor"

13:50.933 --> 13:53.833
with my, uh,
"prescription."

13:56.933 --> 13:59.200
You wish?

13:59.200 --> 14:00.500
Are you sure
you don't have any,

14:00.500 --> 14:03.200
'cause you're buying
a lot of ramen noodles.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.633
That's what -- That's what I --
You know what I mean?

14:05.633 --> 14:09.467
Plus the diamond marijuana
leaf on the hat.

14:09.467 --> 14:11.800
Oh, man.

14:16.767 --> 14:18.833
"Right here'd be
pretty kinky, no?"

14:18.833 --> 14:20.633
Right here'd be pretty --
Ohh.

14:24.167 --> 14:25.933
Right here's what?
I didn't hear you.

14:28.767 --> 14:30.233
Narrator:
Make no mistake about it --

14:30.233 --> 14:34.067
Q is tonight's big loser.

14:34.067 --> 14:36.100
Hey!
Q is our loser.

14:36.100 --> 14:37.700
So we are here
at SLATE New York,

14:37.700 --> 14:40.067
and for your punishment, buddy,
you have to go attend this event

14:40.067 --> 14:42.467
thrown by our friends
at onspeeddating.com.

14:42.467 --> 14:45.100
The rules are simple, bud.
Go out there and mingle

14:45.100 --> 14:46.433
at the speed-dating
event, right?

14:46.433 --> 14:47.800
-Yeah.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.800
-Oh!

14:49.800 --> 14:51.433
We should mention
the other rule.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.767
While at the event, you just
have to keep chomping down

14:53.767 --> 14:55.367
those huge
turkey legs

14:55.367 --> 14:57.667
that we surgically
attached to you

14:57.667 --> 15:00.067
while talking to people
at said event.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.833
Wait, is it over
when I eat both these?

15:01.833 --> 15:03.867
When you're done. When you see
two bones, you're done.

15:03.867 --> 15:05.367
-You're Edward Turkeyhands.
-That's it.

15:05.367 --> 15:07.433
-Or Edward Turkey--

15:07.433 --> 15:09.067
-They got to blur that.

15:09.067 --> 15:10.567
That's got to blur.

15:10.567 --> 15:14.300
**

15:14.300 --> 15:16.933
There he is. There they are.
There are the legs.

15:16.933 --> 15:18.933
Q:
There's grease everywhere.

15:18.933 --> 15:20.333
Murr: Yeah!

15:20.333 --> 15:21.800
All right, once that bell
rings, buddy,

15:21.800 --> 15:23.767
the girl of your dreams
is about to sit down.

15:23.767 --> 15:27.333
If the girl
of my dreams is here,

15:27.333 --> 15:29.700
I'm going to kill you.

15:29.700 --> 15:31.400
Joe: Here we go,
and here come the ladies.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.233
This is so  stupid.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.333
Who's the first girl?
Here she comes.

15:35.333 --> 15:37.400
Oh, here we go! Here we go!

15:37.400 --> 15:38.967
-Hi.
How you doing?

15:38.967 --> 15:40.967
Good. How are you?
What's you name?
Good, good. Brian.

15:40.967 --> 15:42.567
-Brian, I'm Teresa.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.167
-Teresa -- Oh.
-Let me give you an elbow.

15:44.167 --> 15:46.600
Yeah, all right.
How you doing?

15:46.600 --> 15:48.133
-Good, good.

15:48.133 --> 15:49.633
-Little hungry, little --
-Little hungry.

15:49.633 --> 15:51.967
You brought you own food, I see.
Yeah, yeah.

15:51.967 --> 15:54.100
Murr: Take a bite.

15:54.100 --> 15:57.533
You know what's weird? There's
no plate or utensils or napkins.

15:57.533 --> 15:59.700
-It's just a greasy --
He's looking --

15:59.700 --> 16:01.433
-Oh, yeah.

16:01.433 --> 16:02.600
Yeah?

16:03.700 --> 16:05.100
-You look very nice.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.933
-Oh, thank you.
-Yes. You're welcome.

16:06.933 --> 16:09.267
She loves him!
This is -- This girl's fun.

16:09.267 --> 16:11.067
So, what do you do?
I'm sorry.

16:11.067 --> 16:13.433
-I'm a waitress.
Where at?

16:13.433 --> 16:15.667
Yeah, I work at a couple
dive bars in the city.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.567
Oh, get out. Like, which ones?
I love dive bars.

16:18.567 --> 16:19.833
Get out.
Where in the city?

16:19.833 --> 16:21.833
Upper West, 96.

16:21.833 --> 16:24.467
Oh, yeah!

16:24.467 --> 16:26.167
Look at his face.

16:26.167 --> 16:27.933
Are you familiar?

16:27.933 --> 16:29.833
Murr:
Q, there's so much more turkey.

16:29.833 --> 16:31.600
Do you know how long
it takes, technically,

16:31.600 --> 16:33.200
to eat a turkey leg?

16:33.200 --> 16:34.933
Well, I like to eat.

16:34.933 --> 16:36.800
-That's the problem.
-Oh, look at me.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.567
You kidding me?
I come strapped.

16:41.367 --> 16:42.867
-Oh, we rotate. Um...

16:42.867 --> 16:44.833
Aw. Well, maybe I can
get your number,

16:44.833 --> 16:46.333
-and we can go out sometime.
-Okay.

16:46.333 --> 16:48.800
-Oh, here we go!

16:48.800 --> 16:50.833
This is backfiring
in the first minute.

16:50.833 --> 16:52.600
No, it didn't backfire.
He has to eat the turkey.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.067
It has nothing to do
about meeting a woman.

16:54.067 --> 16:55.767
You're right.
At the end day,
he still has to eat

16:55.767 --> 16:57.900
2 pounds of warm fowl.
Yeah.

16:57.900 --> 17:01.167
Murr: Here we go.
Here comes the next girl.

17:01.167 --> 17:03.933
Hi.
Hey.

17:03.933 --> 17:04.967
Hungry?

17:06.533 --> 17:08.633
-Look at his face.
-Oh, I love that tattoo.

17:08.633 --> 17:10.967
-Thank you.
-I'm a fan of birds myself.

17:12.700 --> 17:15.067
What do you do?
-I'm retired.

17:15.067 --> 17:17.067
I was a --
I was a fireman.

17:17.067 --> 17:18.367
Now I do this.

17:20.367 --> 17:22.067
So, what is it you do?

17:22.067 --> 17:24.867
Uh, I-I work in fashion.

17:24.867 --> 17:27.100
Murr: She keeps looking
at the turkey leg.

17:27.100 --> 17:28.667
How long's
your hair been pink?

17:30.400 --> 17:33.067
There it is! There it is.
What was it before?

17:33.067 --> 17:34.967
Um, blonde, blue.

17:34.967 --> 17:36.167
Joe:
He's starting to fill up.

17:36.167 --> 17:38.600
Oh, my God.
There's so much  turkey.

17:40.633 --> 17:42.600
It was great
meeting you, Brian.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.133
It was so nice
meeting you, Megan.

17:44.133 --> 17:45.367
That was uncomfortable.

17:45.367 --> 17:46.500
Saved by the bell.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.500
-Oh, I love that dress.
-Thank you.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.767
-You're very well put together.
-Thank you.

17:53.933 --> 17:55.067
I can't eat any more.

17:55.067 --> 17:57.233
Murr: It's not over
until you eat those.

17:57.233 --> 17:59.233
Dude, this is so horrible.

17:59.233 --> 18:01.333
I'm -- Oh, hey -- Hey!

18:02.967 --> 18:05.400
-Oh, yeah, Brian --

18:05.400 --> 18:08.367
Rhymes with Ryan.

18:08.367 --> 18:10.067
You live in New York City?
I'm sorry.

18:10.067 --> 18:11.833
-Yeah.

18:11.833 --> 18:13.967
I work with --
in trade credit insurance.

18:15.333 --> 18:16.833
Oh

18:19.433 --> 18:21.067
Did you work today?

18:21.067 --> 18:23.100
Yes. Did you?

18:23.100 --> 18:24.333
Um, I did --

18:25.500 --> 18:28.800
He's done!
His mind has fallen asleep.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.400
This is one of the
worst dates I've ever seen.

18:31.400 --> 18:32.733
I feel like
I'm gonna die.

18:32.733 --> 18:34.067
Oh.

18:34.067 --> 18:35.367
It was very nice
to meet you, Brian.

18:35.367 --> 18:36.900
Try to shake her hand.
Try to shake her hand.

18:36.900 --> 18:39.533
Thank you so much.

18:39.533 --> 18:42.067
She reached out and touched.

18:42.067 --> 18:44.067
I need a drink of water.
I can't continue.

18:44.067 --> 18:46.533
-I need something.
-You can get yourself a water.

18:46.533 --> 18:48.867
We should mention this
is the portion of the event

18:48.867 --> 18:50.100
that people just mingle,

18:50.100 --> 18:52.100
so you get to walk around
the event right now

18:52.100 --> 18:53.700
with your turkey hands.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.967
I can't eat
any more  damn turkey.

18:55.967 --> 18:58.467
Sal: There's still
so much turkey left.

18:58.467 --> 18:59.667
It's crazy.

19:01.733 --> 19:04.433
Bartender?

19:04.433 --> 19:05.800
Are you next?

19:07.700 --> 19:09.667
Can I get a water?
Thank you.

19:11.533 --> 19:12.933
And you can see the bone
on that one,

19:12.933 --> 19:14.333
which means I think
I'm almost done,

19:14.333 --> 19:16.833
so I really should --
I should focus on --

19:16.833 --> 19:18.100
I know.

19:21.433 --> 19:23.200
Sal: I like that Q is now
just walking around

19:23.200 --> 19:25.067
just working on
getting the turkey down.

19:25.067 --> 19:27.100
Can't you just put
a tarantula up my ass?

19:28.567 --> 19:30.300
-He's in turkey time out.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.400
He's in turkey
time out!

19:32.400 --> 19:36.067
Ohh. I can't eat
any more turkey.

19:36.067 --> 19:37.867
-Ugh.

19:37.867 --> 19:40.100
You're almost there, buddy.
Keep trucking.

19:40.100 --> 19:41.633
Buddy, you're so cl--
I see bone!

19:41.633 --> 19:44.767
-Yeah, there's bones.
-Dude, there's so much turkey.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.667
The right one's done.
You just got to get through

19:46.667 --> 19:48.833
that left one,
and you're all set.

19:51.333 --> 19:53.633
Eat your way out!
Eat your way to freedom, buddy!

19:53.633 --> 19:54.867
You can do it!

19:54.867 --> 19:58.100
**

19:58.100 --> 20:01.867
Ugh.
I can't do any more.

20:03.933 --> 20:06.667
-You ate your way to victory.
-You did it, buddy.

20:06.667 --> 20:09.733
Q: Oh, guys,
I'm really nauseous.

20:09.733 --> 20:12.133
And that there
is a broken man.

20:12.133 --> 20:14.133
Q: I need a nap. Ohh.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.800
Hey, welcome
to "Impractical Insider."

20:22.800 --> 20:25.867
Q just got stuffed
in tonight's "fowl" punishment,

20:25.867 --> 20:27.733
so we're gonna give you
a behind-the-scenes look

20:27.733 --> 20:30.700
of how it happened, and bonus
footage from tonight's episode.

20:30.700 --> 20:32.567
-Check it out. Ah!
-Oh, God!

20:32.567 --> 20:33.867
So close.

20:33.867 --> 20:36.333
Murr: The speed-dating event
is literally in the next room.

20:36.333 --> 20:38.200
There's nothing separating us
except curtains,

20:38.200 --> 20:40.400
so we had to build
this whole fake room here

20:40.400 --> 20:41.800
so that people
in the speed-dating event

20:41.800 --> 20:42.833
can't hear us laughing.

20:42.833 --> 20:44.767
-We did a time lapse.

20:44.767 --> 20:47.767
**

20:47.767 --> 20:49.933
So, this is what you saw
during the punishment,

20:49.933 --> 20:52.233
but to be honest,
all of this is fake.

20:52.233 --> 20:55.300
As you can see over here,
this is a full, fake wall

20:55.300 --> 20:57.367
that was set up
just for this.

20:57.367 --> 20:59.433
Where did the idea of this
turkey

20:59.433 --> 21:01.367
Sal: All right. For a while,
we wanted to get Joe

21:01.367 --> 21:03.367
to eat 25 hot dogs,
and he --

21:03.367 --> 21:06.067
And I think we were scared
that he might die

21:06.067 --> 21:07.733
'cause of the sodium
and everything,

21:07.733 --> 21:10.567
'cause Joe's already,
like, a big hot dog.

21:10.567 --> 21:13.267
So we changed it

21:13.267 --> 21:15.533
to these two huge
turkey legs,

21:15.533 --> 21:17.500
and we just transferred it
to Q,

21:17.500 --> 21:20.867
'cause Q can't get any more
tired and lazy than he is.

21:23.167 --> 21:25.733
Oh

21:25.733 --> 21:27.133
Q's pants are very nice,

21:27.133 --> 21:29.067
and he came here today
on set with them,

21:29.067 --> 21:30.833
so Joe's being
a really good friend --

21:30.833 --> 21:32.533
Yeah, I'm giving him
my pants to wear,

21:32.533 --> 21:34.733
because my pants
are not as nice as his,

21:34.733 --> 21:35.967
and I'm also kind of
done with them.

21:35.967 --> 21:37.800
If turkey juice gets on them,
I'm all right with it.

21:37.800 --> 21:40.067
There's grease everywhere.

21:40.067 --> 21:42.067
This is the friendship, okay?
You're gonna get punished,

21:42.067 --> 21:43.767
but you're gonna get
my pants while it happens.

21:43.767 --> 21:45.233
I would give him
the pants off my back.

21:45.233 --> 21:46.433
People say to us
all the time,

21:46.433 --> 21:47.833
"You guys are together
all the time.

21:47.833 --> 21:49.667
How do you not kill
each other?" Because it's this.

21:49.667 --> 21:51.167
-Yeah.

21:51.167 --> 21:53.767
Hey!
Q's our big loser.

21:53.767 --> 21:55.167
Is it over
when I eat both of these?

21:55.167 --> 21:57.200
When they're done. When you see
two bones, you're done.

21:57.200 --> 21:58.567
Why did you let me eat
a full meal

21:58.567 --> 21:59.733
before we did this --

21:59.733 --> 22:01.633
Not one of you knowing
that this was gonna happen

22:01.633 --> 22:03.433
watched me
chow down on pasta.

22:03.433 --> 22:05.833
You look like Fred Flintstone.

22:05.833 --> 22:08.267
He's gonna be
walking around, "Wilma"!

22:08.267 --> 22:10.667
Is that 'cause of my giant head
or 'cause of the turkey hands?

22:10.667 --> 22:14.133
Together, it's uncanny.

22:14.133 --> 22:17.100
I love it.
Now, that is a classic picture.

22:17.100 --> 22:19.500
Q: Yeah.
Oh! Is this punishment
gonna backfire on us?

22:19.500 --> 22:22.200
I hope.
I skipped lunch
and then dinner.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.733
And they didn't
give you a plate?

22:23.733 --> 22:25.067
I brought these
on my own.

22:26.933 --> 22:29.367
You are the man. I've got to get
a picture of you with those.

22:29.367 --> 22:31.767
-We can take a -- Yeah.
-She loves him!

22:31.767 --> 22:32.900
She wants a picture!

22:32.900 --> 22:35.333
Look, she's taking a picture!

22:35.333 --> 22:37.067
-I love it, I love it.
-This is amazing.

22:38.100 --> 22:40.800
Oh, this is getting
weird and awkward.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.467
You talked to Brian
for a little while.

22:42.467 --> 22:43.833
What did you think?

22:43.833 --> 22:47.200
Well, I thought he was creative
with the turkey legs.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.800
-Yeah.
-I do think he's cute.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.333
-You look very nice.

22:50.333 --> 22:51.400
-Yeah.
-Oh, thank you.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.667
He couldn't write
your number down,

22:52.667 --> 22:55.333
but if he could, would you have
given him your number?

22:55.333 --> 22:56.900
-I already did.
-Whoa!

22:59.400 --> 23:00.967
Oh, yeah.
Put it right in there.

23:00.967 --> 23:02.633
He's got --

23:02.633 --> 23:04.500
-All right.
-I think we just unlocked

23:04.500 --> 23:06.100
the key to something.

23:06.100 --> 23:07.567
Ugh.

23:07.567 --> 23:09.067
I'm gonna die.

23:09.067 --> 23:10.433
I got her number, though.

23:13.833 --> 23:17.167
-Don't do that. Don't do it.

23:17.167 --> 23:19.333
It's not funny
because it's so obvious.

23:19.333 --> 23:20.733
I'm hugging you.
I'm just hugging you.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.967
Everyone know
I'm scared of the edge.
But I'm hugging you.

23:22.967 --> 23:24.967
You don't understand the feeling
of what that gives me.

23:24.967 --> 23:27.700
Tense -- Tension runs
through my whole body.

23:27.700 --> 23:30.800
You know, you joke around,
but all it takes is one slip up.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.100
Don't do that.
Please stop being like that.

23:36.533 --> 23:38.233
I'm -- I'm gonna walk away,

23:38.233 --> 23:39.933
and I'm not even
gonna be your teammate.

23:39.933 --> 23:43.600
Did you guys see that total?

23:43.600 --> 23:45.867
Even a joke --
He put the Vulcan Spock --
He Spocks me.

23:45.867 --> 23:47.367
-Even a joke.
-He gives me a death grip.
