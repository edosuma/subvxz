00:59.285 --> 01:01.222
the guy's got something better
to do with his time.

01:01.222 --> 01:03.226
Better than come over
our house for dinner?

01:03.226 --> 01:05.765
Yeah. I've got better things
to do, and I still eat here.

01:05.765 --> 01:06.834
This is what you do.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.539
Tell Riggs <i>I</i> haven't
seen him in a while,

01:09.539 --> 01:11.944
and <i>I'm</i> asking him
over for dinner.

01:11.944 --> 01:14.616
I'm not easily offended,
but the guy's getting pricklier.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.553
Oh, so you say.
Every morning.

01:16.553 --> 01:18.223
Not every morning.

01:18.223 --> 01:19.626
Every morning.

01:19.626 --> 01:21.697
Hon, clearly your partner
is going through something

01:21.697 --> 01:23.734
right now, and it's starting
to consume you.

01:23.734 --> 01:26.439
And in the interest of
talking about anything else

01:26.439 --> 01:29.412
over breakfast, get ahead of it.

01:29.412 --> 01:30.848
Hey, there he goes.

01:30.848 --> 01:32.317
(laughs)
Any updates?

01:32.317 --> 01:34.021
Nope. Not talking about it.

01:34.021 --> 01:35.825
What?
Your son

01:35.825 --> 01:39.498
is sitting out his last
winter high school dance

01:39.498 --> 01:41.469
because he hasn't asked
a single girl out yet.

01:41.469 --> 01:44.008
(laughs) RJ is fine.
It's generational.

01:44.008 --> 01:46.847
No one asks anyone
to dances anymore.

01:46.847 --> 01:47.882
That's not true.

01:47.882 --> 01:49.485
I got asked last month,

01:49.485 --> 01:51.055
and it wasn't
even my dance.

01:51.055 --> 01:53.359
If it's anyone's business,
I actually did ask someone.

01:53.359 --> 01:54.428
Honey.

01:54.428 --> 01:55.732
She never texted back, so...

01:55.732 --> 01:57.067
Let's all just move on.

01:57.067 --> 01:58.904
Oh, baby.

01:58.904 --> 02:02.244
MURTAUGH: You don't text someone
and ask them to a dance.

02:02.244 --> 02:03.848
You ask them. In person.

02:03.848 --> 02:04.716
Like a human.

02:04.716 --> 02:05.985
That's it. I'm out.

02:05.985 --> 02:07.722
(chuckles) RJ.

02:07.722 --> 02:10.862
I bet he used emojis.
Rookie mistake.

02:10.862 --> 02:12.498
(phone vibrating)

02:12.498 --> 02:15.337
Uh. I got a dead body
in Koreatown.

02:15.337 --> 02:18.276
See? This is
what texting is for.

02:18.276 --> 02:20.681
Not asking a girl to a dance.
What's wrong with him?

02:20.681 --> 02:23.052
Hey, and don't forget to invite
Riggs to dinner again!

02:23.052 --> 02:24.488
(car horns blaring)

02:24.488 --> 02:27.695
MURTAUGH:
"Generational" my ass.

02:27.695 --> 02:28.864
As long as
there's dances,

02:28.864 --> 02:32.070
there's gonna be kids who ask
other kids to the dance.

02:32.070 --> 02:34.776
So he's gonna need
a little game. Am I wrong?

02:34.776 --> 02:36.947
What? Who needs what?

02:36.947 --> 02:39.786
You're kidding me. You didn't
hear anything I just said?

02:39.786 --> 02:41.924
Sorry, Rog.
Just white noise.

02:43.794 --> 02:45.463
(sighs)
I don't get you, man.

02:45.463 --> 02:46.667
We're supposed
to be partners.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.338
Hey. We <i>are</i> partners.

02:49.338 --> 02:51.877
No. Partners listen.

02:51.877 --> 02:52.712
They engage.

02:52.712 --> 02:55.083
They pretend to care.

02:55.083 --> 02:56.085
Let's try it.

02:56.085 --> 02:59.559
Hey, partner,
what did you do this weekend?

02:59.559 --> 03:00.895
Nothing.

03:00.895 --> 03:02.497
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

03:02.497 --> 03:03.901
Partners answer
the question, Riggs.

03:03.901 --> 03:05.905
I'm answering the question.

03:05.905 --> 03:07.007
I did nothing.

03:07.007 --> 03:09.880
You didn't go nowhere,
do nothing, see nobody;

03:09.880 --> 03:13.386
you just sat in that little
tin coffin, that's it?

03:13.386 --> 03:15.691
Blinking and breathing.

03:15.691 --> 03:18.998
Trish wanted me
to invite you to dinner.

03:18.998 --> 03:21.970
And considering
your social calendar,

03:21.970 --> 03:24.408
I'm assuming you're available.

03:24.408 --> 03:26.078
Can I think about it?

03:26.078 --> 03:29.285
You're killing me.
You're killing me.

03:32.457 --> 03:34.128
BAILEY:
<i>Our D. O. A.'s name</i>

03:34.128 --> 03:36.465

Business cards in his wallet

03:37.969 --> 03:39.673
says he was a party promoter.

03:39.673 --> 03:41.409
This can't be
good for business.

03:41.409 --> 03:42.545
That's helpful.

03:42.545 --> 03:43.881
Single bullet, close range.

03:43.881 --> 03:45.985
Small caliber‐‐
I'm guessing . 38.

So, what's with
the fancy high‐tech, uh...

03:48.022 --> 03:49.425
Wireless headphones?

03:49.425 --> 03:51.162
Yeah.
Came with the corpse.

03:51.162 --> 03:53.166
(sighs) Huh.

03:53.166 --> 03:55.003
Maybe he's from the future.

03:55.003 --> 03:56.840
Maybe he hasn't been
living under a rock

03:56.840 --> 03:58.844
for the past five years.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.304
Look like the future's in here.

04:13.707 --> 04:16.847
(people whooping,
no music playing)

04:22.959 --> 04:24.696
Is it not just me,

04:24.696 --> 04:26.833
but do you hear music?

04:40.761 --> 04:42.598
That's evidence.

04:42.598 --> 04:44.502
I know. It's not like
I was gonna

04:44.502 --> 04:47.207
crush it up and snort it
or anything.

04:47.207 --> 04:49.512
LAPD!

04:49.512 --> 04:52.150
The party's over!
We're shutting this down!

04:52.150 --> 04:54.154
They can't hear you.

04:54.154 --> 04:56.092
I got the bass cranked up.

04:56.092 --> 04:58.162
What is this?

04:58.162 --> 05:00.701

We had a... partners
with benefits sort of thing.

He was really
one of a kind.

06:11.509 --> 06:13.947
You see Adam leave the club
with anyone last night?

06:13.947 --> 06:14.782
No.

06:14.782 --> 06:17.220
It was a total mob scene
last night.

06:24.836 --> 06:27.240
DEEJAY:
Legal chemical supplements.

06:27.240 --> 06:28.810
They're named after Owlsly,

06:28.810 --> 06:30.981
the chemist
who made them for Adam

06:30.981 --> 06:32.217
until they had
a falling out.

06:32.217 --> 06:33.987
I thought everybody loved him.
What happened?

06:33.987 --> 06:37.828
All I know is that, for a while,
the supplements had dried up,

06:37.828 --> 06:39.899
and then last night,
they started flowing again,

06:39.899 --> 06:41.603
and the crowd followed.

06:41.603 --> 06:43.840
So, where can we find
this chemist?

06:43.840 --> 06:45.243
He got a lab somewhere?

06:45.243 --> 06:46.746
Nobody knows.

06:46.746 --> 06:48.784
Adam did,
but he was one of the few.

06:48.784 --> 06:50.854
Owlsly's... super underground.

06:50.854 --> 06:53.125
Ah. What a great thing to be.

06:53.125 --> 06:54.729
Thank you.

06:55.798 --> 06:58.704
SCORSESE:
<i>Owlsly is an artist.</i>

06:58.704 --> 07:01.576
A Leonardo da Vinci
of chemistry.

07:01.576 --> 07:04.147
I thought you said you
had autopsy results.

07:04.147 --> 07:05.283
Oh, on this guy?

07:05.283 --> 07:07.588
Simple gunshot wound.
Open and shut.

07:07.588 --> 07:08.890
I spent the rest
of the morning analyzing

07:08.890 --> 07:10.594
that drug you brought back
from the club.

07:10.594 --> 07:12.698
And by "analyzing," you mean?

07:12.698 --> 07:13.967
I broke it down
to basic compounds,

07:13.967 --> 07:16.138
reverse‐engineered it,
and then I field‐tested

07:16.138 --> 07:17.842
quite a few of them.

07:17.842 --> 07:19.111
That's becoming clear.

07:19.111 --> 07:20.981
Guys, I was blown away.

07:20.981 --> 07:23.052
This isn't old‐school MDMA.

07:23.052 --> 07:25.858
The owl takes Molly

07:25.858 --> 07:27.661
Good‐bye.
Sends her to college,

07:27.661 --> 07:29.030
'cause this is... smooth.

07:29.030 --> 07:30.868
Mind‐expanding.
Is it legal?

07:30.868 --> 07:33.305
And it fixed the third act
of my screenplay.

07:33.305 --> 07:34.709
What?

07:34.709 --> 07:36.145
My guy has
to be half‐man,

07:36.145 --> 07:38.617
half‐lizard, so when
he's fighting the lizards,

07:38.617 --> 07:39.786
he is fighting himself.

07:39.786 --> 07:40.888
Scorsese.

07:40.888 --> 07:43.292
Does this say what
I think it does?

07:43.292 --> 07:44.796
The drug's legal?

07:44.796 --> 07:46.331
Completely legal.
Every single compound,

07:46.331 --> 07:49.705
diphenidine, ephedra,
is elegantly altered just enough

07:49.705 --> 07:51.776
to stay on this side
of the drug laws.

07:51.776 --> 07:53.179
It's an exciting time
to be alive!

07:53.179 --> 07:54.949
You know what'd be
really exciting?

07:54.949 --> 07:57.253
If we can get an address
for the da Vinci of drugs.

07:57.253 --> 07:58.957
Looks like he's
already on it.

07:58.957 --> 08:00.627
He's been searching
shipping manifests

08:00.627 --> 08:01.696
from chemical wholesalers.

08:01.696 --> 08:04.802
Brilliant. Right?
Want to know how I got the idea?

08:04.802 --> 08:07.307
Eh, you know what?

08:07.307 --> 08:08.977
You should put it in the script.

08:08.977 --> 08:11.114
Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Murtaugh, good note.

08:11.114 --> 08:12.383
Yeah.
Yeah! In the lizard's‐‐

08:12.383 --> 08:15.122
I mean, I'll have to translate
it to lizard talk, but totally.

08:15.122 --> 08:16.793
Yeah.

08:16.793 --> 08:19.064
I mean, things... are good.

08:19.064 --> 08:21.001
I mean, Roger's got
a bug up his ass

08:21.001 --> 08:22.170
about how I spend
my weekends.

08:22.170 --> 08:24.307
But other than that,
it's all good.

08:24.307 --> 08:25.677
What you got there?

08:25.677 --> 08:27.046
(mumbles):
I don't know.

08:27.046 --> 08:29.117
Chopped kale with
mustard vinaigrette?

08:33.325 --> 08:34.795
Damn.

08:34.795 --> 08:35.931
Look, I saw it.
I didn't‐‐

08:35.931 --> 08:37.367
There was no name
on it or anything‐‐

08:37.367 --> 08:39.237
Well, no. There it is.

08:39.237 --> 08:40.974
"M. C." Right there.

08:40.974 --> 08:43.112
I'll‐I'll write bigger
next time.

08:43.112 --> 08:46.051
Sorry. I‐I didn't have breakfast
or dinner the night before,

08:46.051 --> 08:47.220
or lunch, for
that matter, so...

08:47.220 --> 08:49.659
So, when you say you spent
the weekend in the trailer,

08:49.659 --> 08:52.063
you actually...
I really don't see
what the problem is.

08:52.063 --> 08:55.202
In fact, I'm looking forward
to next weekend.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.940
Which is kind of the problem.

08:56.940 --> 08:58.409
You see, when what
you most look forward to

08:58.409 --> 09:01.281
in this world is your next
opportunity to avoid it...

09:01.281 --> 09:03.887
(sighs)

09:03.887 --> 09:06.091
...that can be an indicator
of clinical depression.

09:09.364 --> 09:10.901
You think I'm depressed?

09:10.901 --> 09:13.873
It's a treatable condition.

09:13.873 --> 09:15.844
Not interested.

09:15.844 --> 09:17.982
In medication
or in feeling better?

09:17.982 --> 09:19.417
(phone vibrating)

09:19.417 --> 09:20.419
Oop! Got to boogie.

09:20.419 --> 09:22.090
And just when we were
getting somewhere, Doc.

09:22.090 --> 09:23.359
Want the rest of your salad?

09:23.359 --> 09:24.996
I'm good. Enjoy.

Oh. All right.

<i>Scorsese gave you this address?</i>

09:32.176 --> 09:35.149
Yeah. And yes,
he may have field‐tested

09:35.149 --> 09:38.122
one too many supplements
when he gave it to me.

09:43.867 --> 09:46.171
Smile, Rog.

09:46.171 --> 09:47.006
Hello. LAPD.

09:47.006 --> 09:50.112
We're here to speak
to an "Owlsy..."

09:50.112 --> 09:53.787
Why are you having so
much trouble with that?

09:53.787 --> 09:55.189
"Owsy."

09:55.189 --> 09:55.991
Owlsly.

09:55.991 --> 09:57.427
Owlsly. What‐what?
(door buzzes)

09:57.427 --> 09:58.763
You're just making noises.

09:58.763 --> 09:59.899
Yeah, well, so is Owlsly.

09:59.899 --> 10:00.934
Is that it?

10:00.934 --> 10:02.036
(music playing in distance)

10:02.036 --> 10:03.673
What do you want?

10:05.076 --> 10:06.979
Uh, we're looking
for Owlsly.

10:06.979 --> 10:09.084
Uh, I don't know who that is.

10:09.084 --> 10:10.821
I've never heard
that name before.

10:10.821 --> 10:11.823
Sorry. Can't help you.

10:11.823 --> 10:13.058
Another question.

10:14.060 --> 10:16.064
Could it be
that you are Owlsly?

10:16.064 --> 10:17.333
What are you looking at?

10:17.333 --> 10:20.272
RIGGS: Oh! Look at that.
A bunch of owls.
MURTAUGH:
Owls.

10:20.272 --> 10:21.509
Good observation.

10:21.509 --> 10:24.247
Yes. Yes. Fine, whatever.
I'm Owlsly.

10:24.247 --> 10:26.184
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

10:26.184 --> 10:28.122
(sighs)

10:29.057 --> 10:31.261
It's not really for profit.

10:31.261 --> 10:33.533
I see it as
a public service, providing

10:33.533 --> 10:36.404
legal compounds to people who
want their reality supplemented.

10:36.404 --> 10:38.510
Better living
through chemistry, right?

10:38.510 --> 10:40.312
Something like that, yeah.

10:40.312 --> 10:42.150
I got to finish something up.

10:42.150 --> 10:43.085
Hey.

10:43.085 --> 10:44.922
Between the hours
of 8:00 and midnight,

10:44.922 --> 10:46.224
where were you
last night?

10:46.224 --> 10:49.464
Wait. Y‐You think that I killed
him? That's why you're here?

10:49.464 --> 10:52.336
Uh, we just need
to rule certain things out.

10:54.174 --> 10:56.044
Fine. Between 8:00
and midnight, I was here.

10:56.044 --> 10:58.048
Also, before 8:00,
also, after midnight.

10:58.048 --> 10:59.317
And you never
left the house?

10:59.317 --> 11:01.354
Not just yesterday.
I don't go anywhere.

11:01.354 --> 11:03.258
I haven't left this loft
in three years.

11:05.462 --> 11:07.133
Oh.

11:07.133 --> 11:08.536
Nothing wrong with that.
Right, Rog?

11:08.536 --> 11:10.540
So, you don't even
go to the parties

11:10.540 --> 11:12.978
to see the masses
that you're medicating?

11:12.978 --> 11:14.815
No need. Adam set up webcams.

11:14.815 --> 11:17.353
If you have good Wi‐Fi,
it's just like being there.

11:17.353 --> 11:18.388
No, it is not.

11:18.388 --> 11:20.326
He's got a whole thing on this.
Just continue.

11:20.326 --> 11:22.263
There's a whole
world out there.

11:22.263 --> 11:23.332
Yeah, I've seen it.

11:23.332 --> 11:26.037
And anything I want out there,
I can get in here.

11:26.037 --> 11:27.608
Food, books, plants,

11:27.608 --> 11:28.710
you name it.
Alcohol?

11:28.710 --> 11:31.414
Oh, dude, there's a
great app for that.
Really?

11:31.414 --> 11:33.920
Yeah, no, it'll get
to you in, like, 20 minutes.
Beer, whiskey, whatever?

11:33.920 --> 11:35.924
(clears throat, mumbles)

11:35.924 --> 11:37.126
Yeah, we heard

11:37.126 --> 11:38.128
from Jessica, the deejay,

11:38.128 --> 11:40.600
that you had a fight with Adam
over something.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.537
It was a business disagreement.

11:46.044 --> 11:48.282
Adam was pushing
to amp up production.

11:48.282 --> 11:50.286
He was approached
by a Koreatown gang

11:50.286 --> 11:52.023
that wanted
to distribute the owls.

11:52.023 --> 11:54.060
Said we could both get rich.

11:54.060 --> 11:55.897
So, why'd you say no?

11:55.897 --> 11:58.937
They didn't just approach Adam,
they straight‐up threatened him.

11:58.937 --> 12:00.607
I saw it on the webcam.
This one guy got

12:00.607 --> 12:02.511
right up in his face.
He had a gun. It was scary.

12:02.511 --> 12:06.585
I told Adam that if he wanted
to go into business with him,

12:06.585 --> 12:08.121
fine, but I was out.

12:08.121 --> 12:10.560
That's what the
fight was about.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.330
And now you're looking
for the guy who killed him

12:12.330 --> 12:13.465
and you're starting with me?

12:13.465 --> 12:15.336
Seriously?
Find that guy.

12:15.336 --> 12:17.541
So, you actually saw him
getting threatened?

12:17.541 --> 12:19.177
Clear as day.

12:22.049 --> 12:24.187
Why?

12:24.187 --> 12:25.222
RIGGS:
<i>Keep going.</i>

12:25.222 --> 12:26.224
You're doing great.

12:26.224 --> 12:28.362
Seriously, how are these
mug shots not online?

12:28.362 --> 12:30.065
Scan them
and e‐mail them to me.

12:30.065 --> 12:32.103
Sorry, but everything's
down at the station.

12:32.103 --> 12:35.042
Mug shots, sketch artists,
database...

12:35.042 --> 12:36.044
Double dose
on beta blockers.

12:36.044 --> 12:38.148
Getting spikes of anxiety,
mild tachycardia.

12:38.148 --> 12:40.319
Okay, look, we're just
right down here.
I'm not gonna make it.

12:40.319 --> 12:41.922
RIGGS: Hey, guys,
get on the ground.

12:41.922 --> 12:43.125
Get on the ground!

12:49.638 --> 12:51.542
(tires screeching)

12:55.182 --> 12:57.019
RIGGS:
Hey, you okay?

12:57.019 --> 12:58.523
You okay?

12:58.523 --> 13:01.327
This is why I don't
leave my loft.

13:01.327 --> 13:04.333
Hypothesis proven.
People suck.

13:08.141 --> 13:12.049
What I'm saying is, Koreatown
has both a rich complex history

13:12.049 --> 13:13.485
and unique political
challenges.

13:13.485 --> 13:16.124
That's what you've been
saying, and saying.
(groans)

13:16.124 --> 13:17.627
And, look, I could
listen to you talk

13:17.627 --> 13:18.996
about redistricting
all day long,

13:18.996 --> 13:21.468
but the blue Subaru
that shot at us,

13:21.468 --> 13:24.407
it's not gonna track down
itself, so if we could just...

13:24.407 --> 13:26.612
Point is, I requested
some help for you guys,

13:26.612 --> 13:27.681
and it just
came through.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.050
One of LAPD's

13:29.050 --> 13:31.121
real hidden assets.

13:32.657 --> 13:35.429
Detective Henry Cho,
meet Detectives...

13:35.429 --> 13:37.667
Murtaugh and Riggs,
in the flesh.

13:37.667 --> 13:39.137
Damn.

13:39.137 --> 13:40.673
I'm very thrilled
to meet you guys.

13:40.673 --> 13:42.644
So excited to get started.

13:42.644 --> 13:45.583
Detective Cho is a true student
of the Koreatown community.

13:45.583 --> 13:47.988
With all due respect,

13:47.988 --> 13:50.994
Captain, uh,
I just feel that

13:50.994 --> 13:52.998
bringing a third
person into the...

13:52.998 --> 13:54.033
I‐I agree with Riggs.

13:54.033 --> 13:55.469
It's...
I‐I mean,

13:55.469 --> 13:57.473
even two people is
often one too many.

13:57.473 --> 13:58.408
Well, not so much
with that.

13:58.408 --> 14:00.445
That's a little dig, but...
No offense.

14:00.445 --> 14:01.247
None taken.

14:01.247 --> 14:03.351
I'm very happy
to find LAPD members

14:03.351 --> 14:05.957
who have educated themselves
in cultural norms,

14:05.957 --> 14:07.426
K‐Town gang structures,

14:07.426 --> 14:09.397
where to find the best barbeque
on Normandie...

14:12.469 --> 14:15.677
Well, yeah, maybe
a couple hours won't hurt.

14:15.677 --> 14:17.046
RIGGS:
Yeah, yeah.

14:17.046 --> 14:18.048
Let's, uh...
No, you first.

14:18.048 --> 14:19.016
No, you, please.
No, no, please.

14:19.016 --> 14:20.252
Oh, okay. All right.
Well, this is annoying.

14:20.252 --> 14:21.321
If we could just all...

14:22.423 --> 14:24.293
Bailey ran a DMV search,

14:24.293 --> 14:28.301
came up with nine Subaru
owners with criminal ties.

14:28.301 --> 14:31.474
Love it.
Hit the ground running.

14:31.474 --> 14:33.746
Also, sharp hat, Roger.

14:33.746 --> 14:35.148
I mean it.

14:35.148 --> 14:37.353
Thank you, Cho.
Appreciate you noticing.

14:37.353 --> 14:39.090
I'm with this guy
all day long.

14:39.090 --> 14:40.693
Not once has he ever
complimented me

14:40.693 --> 14:42.096
on one of my hats.

14:42.096 --> 14:43.599
What's up?

14:43.599 --> 14:46.437
Oh, look at that.
Did you just put that on?

14:46.437 --> 14:50.112
I got a contact at a club
on Western, Road to Sung's.

14:50.112 --> 14:51.548
The place is known
for two things:

14:51.548 --> 14:54.320
ginseng chicken soup
and its clientele.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.457
K‐Town gang leaders
love the place.

14:56.457 --> 14:59.063
Perfect. So, we'll start
with the chemist,

14:59.063 --> 15:01.334
see if she can I. D.
the Subaru owner,

15:01.334 --> 15:03.305
and then we hit
that Road to Sung's.

15:03.305 --> 15:05.475
Sounds good to me.
All right.

15:05.475 --> 15:08.048
Or... a different idea.

15:08.048 --> 15:10.218
Why don't we split up?

15:10.218 --> 15:11.154
Split up?

15:11.154 --> 15:12.156
What do you mean?

15:12.156 --> 15:14.293
Rog, we don't have to do
everything together.

15:14.293 --> 15:16.030
One of us can
go to the club,

15:16.030 --> 15:17.366
one of us can talk
to the witness,

15:17.366 --> 15:20.105
or... two of us

15:20.105 --> 15:22.042
can do one of those.
I understand the concept.

15:22.042 --> 15:23.211
The captain said we...
Added benefit:

15:23.211 --> 15:24.246
we get twice as much done.

15:24.246 --> 15:25.282
I'm not 100% sure on that‐‐

15:25.282 --> 15:27.219
it's math‐‐
but it sounds right.

15:27.219 --> 15:29.323
Fine. We'll split up.

15:29.323 --> 15:31.060
Fantastic.

15:31.060 --> 15:34.467
But, hey, Riggs, we‐we
can meet up for lunch.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.404
Or not.

15:36.404 --> 15:37.574
Have fun!

15:37.574 --> 15:39.544
Well, that's true.

15:39.544 --> 15:41.080
We'll cover more ground.

15:41.080 --> 15:43.619
Yeah, man,
I understand the idea.

15:43.619 --> 15:47.226
I‐It's... it's how
he expressed it.

15:48.128 --> 15:50.566
I get that.

15:50.566 --> 15:51.769
It's hurtful.

15:51.769 --> 15:55.308
Yeah. Hurtful.

15:55.308 --> 15:57.446
OWLSLY:
<i>What do you want?</i>

15:57.446 --> 16:00.152
I brought the photos
to you this time.

16:02.590 --> 16:04.694
So, uh, I notice
the patrol cars

16:04.694 --> 16:05.696
downstairs were gone.

16:05.696 --> 16:06.765
I sent it away.

16:06.765 --> 16:08.435
You‐You sent them away. How?

16:08.435 --> 16:11.340
I e‐mailed law firms that
specialize in suing the LAPD

16:11.340 --> 16:13.579
till I found a junior partner
willing to draft a letter.

16:13.579 --> 16:15.616
Well, there's people
that are trying to kill you,

16:15.616 --> 16:16.451
so if you'd like to stay alive,

16:16.451 --> 16:18.455
it might behoove...
What if I don't?

16:18.455 --> 16:19.624
I swear to God,

16:19.624 --> 16:22.396
if you start talking about
the glories of Machu Picchu

16:22.396 --> 16:23.566
or the smell of
beignets at Jazz Fest,

16:23.566 --> 16:24.801
I've got compounds
right here

16:24.801 --> 16:26.204
that are gonna knock me out

16:26.204 --> 16:28.174
for a day, a month or forever.

16:28.174 --> 16:30.580
You know,
I've been to Jazz Fest.

16:30.580 --> 16:33.686
It's really just Mardi Gras
for old people.

16:33.686 --> 16:36.558
And beignets are just
fat doughnuts, so...

16:40.131 --> 16:42.537
It's a modified benzo.
Chill.

16:46.310 --> 16:49.350
My dad used to say that the
only way to change the world

16:49.350 --> 16:50.452
was through chemistry.

16:50.452 --> 16:52.690
I was gonna be the
chemist to do it.

16:52.690 --> 16:54.159
Yeah? What happened?

16:54.159 --> 16:56.297
Why? You gonna fix me?

16:56.297 --> 17:00.706
Uh, no, that's not
in my skill set.

17:00.706 --> 17:02.376
You brought it up.

17:02.376 --> 17:05.115
Everything's data, right?

17:05.115 --> 17:06.785
My dad falls asleep
at the wheel.

17:06.785 --> 17:08.589
Dies after dropping me off
at USC.

17:08.589 --> 17:10.458
Head of my research lab
tells me he loves me,

17:10.458 --> 17:13.398
then publishes my research as
his own, goes back to his wife.

17:13.398 --> 17:15.435
Then, finally, when your
business partner's murdered

17:15.435 --> 17:18.308
'cause you don't want to make
drugs for a Korean gangster,

17:18.308 --> 17:20.813
that's called
inherently repeatable data.

17:20.813 --> 17:24.554
Your theory's no
longer a theory.

17:24.554 --> 17:27.426
Help me find the man
who killed your partner.

17:27.426 --> 17:29.463
It's not gonna make the world
a better place,

17:29.463 --> 17:31.768
but it might make
you feel better.

17:31.768 --> 17:33.237
Let me see.

17:38.849 --> 17:39.951
Him.

17:39.951 --> 17:43.559
That's the guy who
threatened Adam.

17:43.559 --> 17:44.694
Thomas Kang.

17:44.694 --> 17:46.932
All right.

17:46.932 --> 17:49.236
Thank you.

17:50.940 --> 17:52.910
♪ Na, na, na, oh, oh, oh... ♪

17:52.910 --> 17:55.816
(Korean pop song playing)

17:55.816 --> 17:58.488
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

17:58.488 --> 18:00.760
Why am I not eating
this every week?

18:00.760 --> 18:04.466
I've always thought lunch is the
most important meal of the day.

18:04.466 --> 18:05.703
Yes, it is.

18:05.703 --> 18:09.476
But I've got a partner with
the palate of a 12‐year‐old.

18:09.476 --> 18:11.748
Canned cheese.

18:11.748 --> 18:13.919
That's a delicacy
to this guy.
(speaks Korean)

18:13.919 --> 18:16.525
(both speak Korean)

18:17.827 --> 18:19.196
(speaks Korean)

18:22.804 --> 18:24.808
Roger.

18:24.808 --> 18:27.847
Your contact is
a doumi hostess.

18:27.847 --> 18:28.982
Mm‐hmm.

18:28.982 --> 18:30.385
Do we have a problem here?

18:30.385 --> 18:32.557
Oh, no, not‐‐ Please, sit.

18:32.557 --> 18:34.226
No disrespect.

18:34.226 --> 18:36.230
It's just, it was
my understanding

18:36.230 --> 18:39.369
that the doumi culture
was going away.

18:39.369 --> 18:42.242
I read it in an article
on the LAPD Web site.

18:42.242 --> 18:43.244
You read that?

18:43.244 --> 18:44.246
Yeah.

18:44.246 --> 18:45.014
I wrote that.

18:45.014 --> 18:46.952
You‐‐ What?!

18:46.952 --> 18:49.423
Yeah, I wrote that.
Yes? It was amazing.

18:49.423 --> 18:50.593
Guys.
I know, it's...

18:50.593 --> 18:51.327
The meter is running.

18:51.327 --> 18:53.766
An hour to talk
or karaoke with.

18:53.766 --> 18:57.372
What we need is information
on who might be involved

18:57.372 --> 18:59.711
in a turf war over club drugs.

18:59.711 --> 19:02.884
A party promoter was
shot down yesterday.

19:02.884 --> 19:04.353
Near Seventh Street?

19:04.353 --> 19:06.223
Yeah. That's the one.

19:06.223 --> 19:10.599
The guy you're looking for is
in the lounge next to the bar.

19:17.647 --> 19:18.649
Okay.

19:26.565 --> 19:29.236
(women laughing)

19:35.448 --> 19:37.520
We got three guys,
at least two guns.

19:37.520 --> 19:38.822
I'm thinking
the move is...

19:38.822 --> 19:40.325
Wait for backup.

19:40.325 --> 19:41.828
Wait for backup.

19:41.828 --> 19:43.464
Yeah, this is protocol.

19:43.464 --> 19:46.470
There's a risk
of collateral damage.

19:46.470 --> 19:47.840
Plus, I already
called it in.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.911
Did I overstep?

19:49.911 --> 19:52.516
No. It makes sense.

19:52.516 --> 19:56.023
We never wait for backup.
Riggs hates waiting for backup.

19:56.023 --> 19:57.660
Oh, that's so
counterintuitive.

19:57.660 --> 19:58.662
Yes.

19:58.662 --> 20:01.902
Now, shouldn't we have heard
from Riggs?

20:01.902 --> 20:03.004
Of course we should've.

20:03.004 --> 20:06.912
I text him that we found
our guy, like, three times.

20:06.912 --> 20:10.519
Oh.
It's like he refuses
to text me back.

20:10.519 --> 20:12.657
That's not okay.
No.

20:12.657 --> 20:14.426
This is a
two‐way street.
Two ways.

20:14.426 --> 20:15.963
A partnership is a‐‐

20:15.963 --> 20:17.432
(whispers):
Wait, hold on. No, no.

20:17.432 --> 20:18.835
Put it behind you,
put it behind you.

20:18.835 --> 20:23.077
Okay, so, Owlsly
I. D.'d Kang as our guy,

20:23.077 --> 20:25.048
so we should
be good to go.

20:25.048 --> 20:28.087
MURTAUGH: Would've been nice
to read that in a text.

20:28.087 --> 20:29.156
You know, the same way

20:29.156 --> 20:30.325
that I text you
that he was here.

20:30.325 --> 20:32.930
You don't like the pork
skin in the sweet and sour?

20:32.930 --> 20:34.132
Okay, this is cute,

20:34.132 --> 20:36.671
but can we just get to it?
Where is he?

20:36.671 --> 20:37.974
Lounge three.

20:37.974 --> 20:40.445
But we're waiting for backup.

20:44.152 --> 20:45.956
Since when do we wait
for backup?

20:45.956 --> 20:48.427
Since now.
Since it's protocol.

20:48.427 --> 20:51.133
Mm‐hmm.
And‐and since there's a risk
of collateral damage.

20:51.133 --> 20:53.170
That's right.
RIGGS: Okay, how about
the risk of losing our guy?

20:53.170 --> 20:54.473
Or the fact that we never
wait for backup?

20:54.473 --> 20:57.445
MURTAUGH: Why are you
including him? There's...
Guys! Shooter!

20:57.445 --> 20:59.449
RIGGS:
Oh, everybody down!

20:59.449 --> 21:00.786
(people screaming)

21:23.497 --> 21:25.602
(women screaming, sobbing)

21:33.484 --> 21:35.689
Oh, great.
Congratulations.

21:35.689 --> 21:36.791
You lost Kang.

21:36.791 --> 21:37.960
<i>You</i> lost Kang.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.964
See, that is exactly what
someone who lost Kang would say.

21:39.964 --> 21:42.235
Hey, why don't you call me
when backup gets here?

21:42.235 --> 21:44.640
It's a two‐way street, Riggs!

21:44.640 --> 21:46.076
Yup!
Two ways!

21:47.713 --> 21:49.984
I want to calm down,
but I can't.

21:49.984 --> 21:50.853
It's his behavior,

21:50.853 --> 21:54.660
his pathological refusal
to communicate!

21:54.660 --> 21:56.865
Breathe. Sit and breathe.

21:56.865 --> 21:59.069
The guy you shot,
Kang's pal,

21:59.069 --> 22:00.204
we got his phone.

22:00.204 --> 22:01.508
Bailey and Cho
are working on it.

22:01.508 --> 22:02.543
The day wasn't a total loss.

22:02.543 --> 22:07.653
The problem is bigger
than just today.

22:07.653 --> 22:09.857
I mean, maybe he's not built
to be a partner.

22:09.857 --> 22:12.128
I mean, you can't just
blindly roll the dice...

22:12.128 --> 22:13.832
It wasn't a blind roll
of the dice.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.170
I could've put Riggs
with anyone; I chose you.

22:16.170 --> 22:17.138
Why?

22:17.138 --> 22:18.808
Do you remember our
first couple of weeks?

22:18.808 --> 22:20.579
The crap that I was
going through

22:20.579 --> 22:21.514
when they put us together?

22:21.514 --> 22:23.818
Man, you were a picnic
compared to this dude.

22:23.818 --> 22:25.188
I was a mess.

22:25.188 --> 22:26.256
My confidence was shot.

22:26.256 --> 22:29.129
I'd been in a car with
Jenkins for six months.

22:29.129 --> 22:30.866
(snickers)
Jenkins.

22:30.866 --> 22:31.734
The homophobic Swede.

22:31.734 --> 22:33.137
And that's what
he called himself.

22:33.137 --> 22:34.607
(both chuckle)

22:34.607 --> 22:36.611
Do you know what
a centerboard is?

22:37.746 --> 22:39.149
Centerboard? Mm.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.588
It's a part of the sailboat
that you can't see.

22:41.588 --> 22:44.694
But it keeps the boat upright
and allows it to be steered.

22:44.694 --> 22:46.731
That's you, my friend.

22:46.731 --> 22:49.302
It's why I put
you with Riggs.

22:49.302 --> 22:51.608
It wasn't an accident.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.318
(sighs)

22:57.318 --> 23:00.157
CAHILL: Grocery shopping
for next weekend?

23:00.157 --> 23:01.561
(grunts)

23:01.561 --> 23:02.997
I heard about Koreatown.

23:02.997 --> 23:04.734
Yeah, you and
the rest of the building.

23:04.734 --> 23:07.973
Your partner does have
a voice that carries.

23:07.973 --> 23:10.646
Maybe he needs some of those
weekly sessions with you.

23:10.646 --> 23:12.181
Deal with his anger issues.

23:12.181 --> 23:14.085
You think Roger has
anger issues?

23:14.085 --> 23:15.522
What, you don't?

23:15.522 --> 23:16.924
The man's angry
about everything.

23:16.924 --> 23:18.795
He's furious about
how I spend my weekends.

23:18.795 --> 23:22.001
Maybe that's not so much anger
as it is fear.

23:22.001 --> 23:24.039
Fear of what?

23:24.039 --> 23:25.274
Educated guess?

23:25.274 --> 23:27.680
Knowing that he's your one
connection to the outside world.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.817
I mean, that would
scare the crap out of anyone.

23:31.888 --> 23:33.692
How's that my problem?

23:33.692 --> 23:34.927
Riggs,

23:34.927 --> 23:38.968
don't burn your one bridge
out of wherever it is you are.

23:41.708 --> 23:42.910
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

23:42.910 --> 23:44.980
TRISH:
<i>Roger, can you get that?</i>

23:47.018 --> 23:48.020
Riggs.
Hey.

23:48.020 --> 23:49.724
What are you doing here?

23:49.724 --> 23:51.794
Wait. I thought
dinner was tonight.

23:51.794 --> 23:52.996
You don't want me
here now?

23:52.996 --> 23:55.969
No, the point is you don't
want to be here. Trust me.

23:55.969 --> 23:58.374
I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

23:58.374 --> 24:00.378
Roger thought
you might not come.

24:00.378 --> 24:01.714
So, okay, I want you

24:01.714 --> 24:03.250
to meet a friend
of mine, Kate.

24:03.250 --> 24:04.553
Hi.
This is Martin.
Martin, Kate.

24:04.553 --> 24:05.655
Hi.
Hi, Kate.

24:05.655 --> 24:06.891
Nice to meet you.

24:06.891 --> 24:09.329
So, I‐I hope everybody
brought their appetites.

24:09.329 --> 24:11.066
Oh, yes.
All right, come on.

24:11.066 --> 24:13.170
(Trish laughs)

24:13.170 --> 24:15.776
KATE: And the two of us
are stuck doing discovery

24:15.776 --> 24:18.213
in a warehouse in
Sylmar for a week.

24:18.213 --> 24:19.750
(laughs)
No air conditioning.

24:19.750 --> 24:20.752
Mid‐August.

24:20.752 --> 24:22.756
I must've lost, I don't know,
five pounds.

24:22.756 --> 24:24.593
Matter of fact, I'm thinking
about going back there

24:24.593 --> 24:25.962
next summer.

24:25.962 --> 24:26.964
(laughs)

24:26.964 --> 24:28.968
(both mouthing)

24:30.204 --> 24:32.643
So, you're new to L. A.?

24:35.047 --> 24:36.216
Yeah.

24:36.216 --> 24:37.653
How are you spending
your downtime?

24:37.653 --> 24:40.992
I'm always
looking for tips.

24:40.992 --> 24:42.729
Um...

24:42.729 --> 24:44.132
I don't really have any tips.

24:44.132 --> 24:45.769
Of course you got tips.

24:45.769 --> 24:47.639
Tell her how
you spent your weekend.

24:52.348 --> 24:53.952
I, um... (clears throat)

24:53.952 --> 24:55.421
kind of tuned out
this past weekend.

24:55.421 --> 24:57.391
You know, I had a little
sabbatical with myself.

24:57.391 --> 24:59.028
I think that's great.

24:59.028 --> 25:01.032
It's healthy. There are
studies that talk about

25:01.032 --> 25:02.903
how we need alone time
to recharge.

25:03.938 --> 25:06.911
It is healthy, isn't it?

25:06.911 --> 25:09.015
You know what?
Maybe Roger would love to

25:09.015 --> 25:11.186
take a look at some of those
studies. Send them over to him.

25:11.186 --> 25:12.723
MURTAUGH: You know
what's interesting about Riggs?

25:12.723 --> 25:14.158
Is he can be on a sabbatical,

25:14.158 --> 25:15.361
even when he's with someone.

25:15.361 --> 25:18.267
Well, it's just easier with some
than others, you know?

25:18.267 --> 25:20.705
Yeah. Well, you know when
he's really on a sabbatical?

25:20.705 --> 25:21.974
Is when you're
trying to text him.

25:21.974 --> 25:23.410
Oh, he's never healthier.
Oh, wow.

25:23.410 --> 25:25.882
So now we're gonna
bring up my phone etiquette?
It's terrible.

25:25.882 --> 25:27.686
It's terrible?
So what would you like me to do?

25:27.686 --> 25:28.855
Maybe send a little
smiley face

25:28.855 --> 25:29.890
and a bunch more emojis?
TRISH: Guys, okay.

25:29.890 --> 25:31.293
Enough.
Oh, yeah, give me
a little hello...

25:31.293 --> 25:32.328
Enough!

25:33.163 --> 25:35.000
Enough.

25:36.403 --> 25:39.309
I told you
this wouldn't work.

25:41.346 --> 25:43.216
(sighs)

25:43.216 --> 25:45.287
That's what this is?

25:45.287 --> 25:47.626
You guys playing matchmaker?

25:51.366 --> 25:53.972
I'm sorry, Kate,
this must be a little, um...

25:53.972 --> 25:55.274
Little bit.

25:55.274 --> 25:57.311
Excuse me.

25:57.311 --> 25:59.048
Thank you, Trish.

25:59.048 --> 26:00.384
Uh...

26:00.384 --> 26:03.190
(cell phone ringing)

26:03.190 --> 26:04.225
Hey.

26:04.225 --> 26:06.329
It's Bailey.

26:10.371 --> 26:11.439
Go, Bailey.

26:11.439 --> 26:14.112
I pulled the last 12 hours
of text off the phone.

26:14.112 --> 26:15.381
You need to hear
the most recent.

26:15.381 --> 26:18.253
I'm putting Cho on now.

26:18.253 --> 26:20.157
I'm translating
from the Korean,

26:20.157 --> 26:21.426
but it's pretty
straightforward.

26:21.426 --> 26:23.296
It says,
"I'm done waiting.

26:23.296 --> 26:25.367
Get to the deejay
and chemist tonight."

26:25.367 --> 26:27.171
It was sent
just before noon today.

26:27.171 --> 26:28.040
Okay.

26:28.040 --> 26:29.877
All right, I'm going
to get Owlsly.

26:29.877 --> 26:31.446
Cho, we're gonna
get the deejay.

26:31.446 --> 26:32.783
Baby, I'm sorry about...

26:32.783 --> 26:34.720
Consider it a mercy killing.

26:34.720 --> 26:35.889
Go.

No, it can wait, it can wait.

Yeah.

they were already at the door,

it sounded like
the end of the world up here.

28:36.262 --> 28:38.567
What do you think
they were looking for?

28:38.567 --> 28:39.368
I mean, other than you.

28:39.368 --> 28:41.507
No idea. Whatever
they could find.

You'll be happy to know I'm
taking your advice, getting out.

Ah.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.247
I thought I would see
if there was something

29:02.247 --> 29:03.483
in there that might help.

29:03.483 --> 29:05.487
I mean, how‐how
do you do that?

29:05.487 --> 29:08.226
I mean, don't you
need her approval?

29:08.226 --> 29:11.032
How... how would
I get that on my phone?

29:11.032 --> 29:14.506
Roger, this is
a genuine question.

29:14.506 --> 29:18.079
Do you want me to explain it
to you or just do it for you?

29:18.079 --> 29:21.987
Henry Cho, you get me.

29:21.987 --> 29:23.924
She's awake again.

29:23.924 --> 29:25.460
You can have ten more minutes.

29:25.460 --> 29:27.398
Thank you.

29:32.007 --> 29:34.513
Sorry. I keep drifting off.

29:34.513 --> 29:37.552
So, you were saying
there were two men?

29:37.552 --> 29:40.390
One had a gun.

29:40.390 --> 29:42.461
They forced me into the hallway

29:42.461 --> 29:45.133
and started yelling,
"Where's the money?"

29:45.133 --> 29:47.505
No one even noticed.

29:47.505 --> 29:48.473
What money?

29:49.475 --> 29:53.016
They said they gave Adam
half a million dollars

29:53.016 --> 29:54.920
and they wanted it back.

29:54.920 --> 29:56.657
A half million.

29:56.657 --> 29:58.026
Was that true?

29:58.026 --> 30:00.297
If it was,
I never heard about it.

30:00.297 --> 30:02.669
But they didn't
believe me.

30:02.669 --> 30:06.275
They just kept hitting me
and yelling, did I have it,

30:06.275 --> 30:07.545
did Owlsly have it.

30:07.545 --> 30:09.683
I told them I don't even
know who Owlsly is.

30:09.683 --> 30:12.154
So, you lied to them,
like you lied to us.

30:12.154 --> 30:14.191
I didn't... I didn't lie to you.

30:14.191 --> 30:15.628
Well, if you don't know
who Owlsly is,

30:15.628 --> 30:18.166
then why is she
on your Instagram page?

30:18.166 --> 30:20.003
Her?

30:20.003 --> 30:22.007
No, that's not.

30:22.007 --> 30:23.109
That's what's‐her‐name.

30:23.109 --> 30:24.445
That's Olive something

30:24.445 --> 30:26.315
from‐from our
freshmen hall.

30:26.315 --> 30:29.455
Was just some weirdo
that had a crush on Adam.

30:31.392 --> 30:33.931
You and Adam were close.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.339
We were business partners.

30:38.339 --> 30:39.408
I told you.

30:42.080 --> 30:45.353
You didn't tell me
you were in love with him.

30:54.371 --> 30:57.244
Because the feeling
wasn't mutual.

30:59.381 --> 31:02.054
Come on, Owlsly.

31:02.054 --> 31:03.691
You're not telling me
everything.

31:10.571 --> 31:14.011
He told me he had been
in love with me since college,

31:14.011 --> 31:15.548
and I bought it.

31:15.548 --> 31:18.587
Adam could talk anyone
into anything.

31:18.587 --> 31:20.758
Talked Kang out of
half a million dollars.

31:20.758 --> 31:22.494
Talked you into making pills
for him.

31:27.337 --> 31:29.475
He said we'd start
a life together.

31:29.475 --> 31:32.682
I thought,
for one brief moment,

31:32.682 --> 31:36.389
(distorted): I was gonna be
a part of the world again.

31:36.389 --> 31:37.424
But I was wrong.

31:37.424 --> 31:41.098
He was still
sleeping with Jessica.

31:41.098 --> 31:45.073
I killed him because
he made me feel stupid.

31:45.073 --> 31:47.645
I dropped my guard.

31:47.645 --> 31:49.315
I let him in.

31:57.532 --> 32:00.236
I'm gonna need you
to put that bag down.

32:00.236 --> 32:01.873
(distorted):
No problem.

32:01.873 --> 32:03.142
You should sit down, though.

32:03.142 --> 32:04.679
You should, um...

32:09.789 --> 32:11.258
How'd you do that?

32:11.258 --> 32:14.131
Transdermal from contact.

32:14.131 --> 32:15.534
The hug?

32:15.534 --> 32:17.170
It's just gonna
slow you down.

32:17.170 --> 32:18.807
Nothing permanent.

32:18.807 --> 32:22.280
I'm sorry. I... I just,
I needed a head start.

a really nice apology wine.

41:39.126 --> 41:41.130
I mean, he could be,
you know, full of crap

41:41.130 --> 41:42.667
and just trying
to sell the bottle, but...

41:42.667 --> 41:45.072
No, it's lovely.
Thank you for the wine.

41:45.072 --> 41:48.144
Look, um, I'm sorry
about last night.

41:48.144 --> 41:50.750
You know, not being
sociable with your friend.

41:50.750 --> 41:54.156
Oh, I appreciate that,
but I shouldn't have pushed.

41:54.156 --> 41:56.427
I was out of line.

41:56.427 --> 41:57.898
No, you weren't.

41:59.801 --> 42:00.837
Look, Trish,

42:00.837 --> 42:05.980
at some point,
I'm gonna need a little push.

42:08.886 --> 42:10.857
Roger!

42:10.857 --> 42:11.892
MURTAUGH:
Yeah?

42:11.892 --> 42:12.994
Your partner's here.

42:12.994 --> 42:14.030
MURTAUGH:
Cho?

42:14.030 --> 42:15.833
Is it Ch‐‐ (groans)

42:15.833 --> 42:16.969
(laughter)

42:16.969 --> 42:18.873
MURTAUGH:
Is that you?
Wow.

42:18.873 --> 42:20.977
You staying for dinner?

42:20.977 --> 42:23.114
Uh, no.
I just wanted to drop off

42:23.114 --> 42:26.454
some apology wine,
and, uh...
Thank you.

42:26.454 --> 42:27.991
I got plans, so...

42:27.991 --> 42:29.193
Plans? Actual plans?

42:29.193 --> 42:31.765
Like "put on pants"
kind of plans?

42:31.765 --> 42:34.470
Yes, Rog, actual plans.

42:34.470 --> 42:36.074
All right.

42:36.074 --> 42:38.178
Good night, guys.
BOTH: Good night.

42:39.480 --> 42:41.317
TRISH:
Hey!

42:41.317 --> 42:42.086
How are you feeling?

42:42.086 --> 42:43.789
Are we on
speaking terms yet?

42:43.789 --> 42:45.058
I'd rather not talk about this.

42:45.058 --> 42:46.394
Oh, we're talking about it.

42:46.394 --> 42:48.365
If you don't tell Dad,
I will.

42:48.365 --> 42:49.768
Tell Dad what?

42:49.768 --> 42:50.837
Nothing.

42:50.837 --> 42:54.043
RJ got asked to the dance
by three different girls.

42:54.043 --> 42:56.080
What?!
Three different girls?

42:56.080 --> 42:57.216
Three?!
Are you serious?

42:57.216 --> 42:58.451
They were all a part
of this big crowd

42:58.451 --> 42:59.487
that saw him get
shot down by Lindsay.

42:59.487 --> 43:02.259
And‐and they felt sorry
for him. That's good.

43:02.259 --> 43:03.929
That's good strategy.
No, they were impressed.

43:03.929 --> 43:04.998
They said that
they'd never...

43:04.998 --> 43:07.937
Never seen a guy ask
a girl out in person.
Yeah.

43:07.937 --> 43:08.873
'Cause nobody does it.

43:08.873 --> 43:10.877
Didn't I say that?
What did I tell you?

43:10.877 --> 43:13.281
Fielding offers. Come on, now.
You're welcome, Dad.

43:13.281 --> 43:14.918
So which one you gonna pick?

43:14.918 --> 43:16.187
You don't get to
weigh in on this one.

43:16.187 --> 43:17.423
Look, this is what
you got to do.

43:17.423 --> 43:20.128
Oh, I can't wait to hear this.
What would you do, Roger?

43:20.128 --> 43:22.366
You got to learn to put
a little bass in your voice.

43:22.366 --> 43:23.803
