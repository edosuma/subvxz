00:36.469 --> 00:41.810
(The Lady in Dignity)

00:42.780 --> 00:44.149
The divorce documents are registered.

00:44.380 --> 00:46.020
The court will send them to you soon.

00:46.119 --> 00:49.049
I can't abandon my wife and daughter in any circumstances.

00:49.149 --> 00:51.020
- What about me? - I can't abandon you either.

00:51.159 --> 00:52.490
You greedy fool.

00:52.560 --> 00:54.530
How can she expect to hide something like this?

00:54.659 --> 00:56.530
How can she think that I wouldn't find out?

00:56.659 --> 00:58.259
So, you were going to stab her...

00:58.700 --> 01:00.270
Did you mean to kill her?

01:00.369 --> 01:02.630
Yes. I did.

01:03.100 --> 01:06.909
I don't know who'll kill you, but it'll happen sooner or later.

01:06.969 --> 01:09.409
Stop this. Why are you doing this? You haven't met me before.

01:09.469 --> 01:11.340
I am thinking about how I'm going to use this.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.409
That stupid fool.

01:15.480 --> 01:19.319
Do you think Park Bok Ja will take care of you forever?

01:19.480 --> 01:22.549
How can you prove that you didn't pay him for that tape?

01:22.650 --> 01:24.390
Park Bok Ja is not going to settle.

01:24.489 --> 01:27.689
Even if you divorce Jae Seok, will you help the company?

01:27.760 --> 01:30.560
We can't help each other.

01:30.859 --> 01:34.769
I don't seek what's not mine.

01:41.370 --> 01:42.409
Hello?

01:42.510 --> 01:43.510
Ms. Woo.

01:43.579 --> 01:45.680
I'm about to leave for the day,

01:46.010 --> 01:48.010
but Mr. Ahn just got home.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.950
That girl is here too. They are in the room together now.

01:51.719 --> 01:55.120
Shall I stay and keep an eye on them until you get home?

01:55.420 --> 01:58.859
You don't need to do that. Just get going. Thank you.

02:08.330 --> 02:09.330
Mr. Han.

02:09.870 --> 02:11.340
I'm coming to see you.

02:11.800 --> 02:12.840
Sure.

02:13.039 --> 02:14.069
See you soon.

02:17.740 --> 02:19.539
(Auto braking was activated.)

02:31.719 --> 02:34.530
You fool. What if someone sees you?

02:34.930 --> 02:36.289
Why didn't you pick up?

02:36.360 --> 02:37.629
I was at the hospital.

02:38.099 --> 02:39.129
Get in.

02:39.430 --> 02:40.500
Before anyone sees you.

03:04.289 --> 03:05.389
Go ahead.

03:06.159 --> 03:07.159
What should we do now?

03:07.490 --> 03:09.729
- What do you mean? - She wants 100,000 dollars back.

03:10.229 --> 03:13.030
I'm in deep trap now. She said that she'll report me to the police.

03:13.830 --> 03:15.699
Use your brain, will you?

03:15.969 --> 03:18.469
All she has is that recording. Why are you so scared?

03:18.539 --> 03:21.469
Just tell the police you said those things because she made you to.

03:21.539 --> 03:22.539
Why should I?

03:23.310 --> 03:25.340
Why do I have to do that? Am I your puppet?

03:25.539 --> 03:27.379
You are my puppet.

03:27.379 --> 03:29.080
Did you think that you were my business partner or what?

03:30.080 --> 03:32.379
I told you to just follow my orders.

03:32.780 --> 03:33.819
You.

03:34.289 --> 03:36.620
Just do as I say, okay?

03:37.419 --> 03:39.490
If you don't, you'll be screwed.

03:40.330 --> 03:41.629
Let's be honest here.

03:41.729 --> 03:44.530
You don't have any evidence to prove that I put you up to it.

03:44.960 --> 03:46.000
Bok Ja.

03:46.629 --> 03:48.099
You can't say it like that.

03:48.169 --> 03:50.439
Listen, the best thing you can do now is...

03:50.500 --> 03:53.300
keep on being my puppet and doing a good job at it.

03:53.370 --> 03:55.509
Don't be all confused and lame.

03:56.210 --> 03:58.139
You must do as I say if you want to live.

04:00.750 --> 04:01.780
I don't want to.

04:02.550 --> 04:03.550
You don't want to?

04:03.719 --> 04:06.180
Show me something concrete so that I can trust you.

04:07.419 --> 04:08.719
What do you want me to show you?

04:08.819 --> 04:09.849
Money.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.159
Money?

04:13.759 --> 04:15.229
Yes, I want money.

04:20.569 --> 04:23.069
Do you know what climbing the social ladder has taught me?

04:24.769 --> 04:26.170
People here have something...

04:26.839 --> 04:29.939
that those at the bottom of the ladder cannot emulate.

04:29.939 --> 04:30.980
Do you know what it is?

04:33.310 --> 04:34.649
They use their brains.

04:35.910 --> 04:38.250
Those who live hand to mouth are...

04:38.680 --> 04:42.750
only concerned with immediate profit even if it's not much money at all,

04:43.519 --> 04:46.189
but these people here look far ahead...

04:47.360 --> 04:49.389
and see the bigger picture in everything they do.

04:49.889 --> 04:51.560
There is one more thing. Do you know what it is?

04:53.129 --> 04:55.829
They never spend money on useless things.

04:57.300 --> 04:59.069
Why would I spend money on you?

04:59.600 --> 05:01.509
Do you want money? You've done nothing to earn it.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.740
How dare you try to blackmail me.

05:04.810 --> 05:05.839
Bok Ja.

05:06.279 --> 05:08.110
Wake up, you fool.

05:08.750 --> 05:09.980
You should just...

05:10.149 --> 05:13.019
keep bumming around in the slums because it suits you the best.

05:13.790 --> 05:16.449
This is precisely why you can't get out of that hellhole.

05:20.860 --> 05:23.860
The 80 dollars you gave me when I got out of jail.

05:24.829 --> 05:26.459
I'm paying you back with interest.

05:27.529 --> 05:28.670
Go to a sauna or something.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.569
What you and I did are...

05:34.670 --> 05:36.939
insignificant in the grand scheme of things.

05:37.779 --> 05:39.779
Are you going to tell Chairman Ahn everything?

05:40.310 --> 05:42.279
Do you think he'll believe you?

05:43.879 --> 05:46.649
No, the table has turned.

05:48.019 --> 05:50.189
People in the top portion of the ladder are...

05:51.160 --> 05:52.660
born with different blood.

05:57.129 --> 05:58.199
I'm no longer...

05:59.399 --> 06:01.529
the Park Bok Ja you used to know.

06:10.680 --> 06:11.680
Get off.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.389
Get off already.

06:28.490 --> 06:30.360
Take a taxi to go home, okay?

06:43.240 --> 06:46.040
Ms. Park, you're now the vice chairwoman of Daesung Pulp.

06:46.279 --> 06:48.279
Do you know what's the first step to a fresh start...

06:48.680 --> 06:50.319
whether it's for someone who's starting over...

06:50.379 --> 06:51.879
or a new administration that's commencing?

06:51.920 --> 06:53.220
It's wiping the slate clean.

06:53.389 --> 06:56.759
You must desert your old self and those whom you used to know.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.220
It's the most crucial step.

06:58.490 --> 07:02.329
You may feel that it's too ruthless and heartless at times,

07:02.459 --> 07:03.560
but you still have to do it.

07:04.029 --> 07:07.569
Otherwise, your past will bog you down.

07:31.720 --> 07:35.189
What? Are you saying we should live there?

07:35.259 --> 07:38.199
Let's go. We won't have to worry about other people there.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.529
I don't want to.

07:40.269 --> 07:43.699
Then, how about we meet up at that house every morning?

07:46.470 --> 07:48.769
- Are you a pervert? - I'm not.

07:49.410 --> 07:50.910
I just want to protect our love.

07:50.980 --> 07:53.680
Me too. But how can you suggest going there if that's the case?

07:53.910 --> 07:54.949
Stop being ridiculous.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.480
Both of you are insane.

07:59.319 --> 08:01.120
- A Jin. - What is that in the living room?

08:01.189 --> 08:02.790
Who set up that thing in my house?

08:02.949 --> 08:05.720
I hate seeing a mess. Don't you know that?

08:06.120 --> 08:08.029
- I do. - You get rid of it right now.

08:08.129 --> 08:12.100
The couch is too uncomfortable, and I'm not allowed in Ji Hu's room.

08:12.399 --> 08:13.569
Where am I supposed to sleep?

08:15.600 --> 08:19.199
She could not utter what was on the tip of her tongue.

08:20.769 --> 08:23.069
"Just sleep in this room with that woman."

08:33.320 --> 08:37.389
The body is an amalgamation of sludge when we're alive,

08:37.960 --> 08:39.419
and there's something more disgusting...

08:39.419 --> 08:41.429
and corrosive than undigested food...

08:41.529 --> 08:43.399
that we have to eliminate.

08:43.629 --> 08:45.559
It's emotional sludge.

09:22.870 --> 09:23.940
So, what are you going to do?

09:26.240 --> 09:27.240
What about?

09:27.539 --> 09:29.039
Are you going to divorce me?

09:29.570 --> 09:30.610
Of course.

09:30.980 --> 09:32.179
I'll just raise the child.

09:35.409 --> 09:37.220
You've been raising my son,

09:38.049 --> 09:39.450
so I'll be a father to that baby.

09:40.190 --> 09:41.220
What a surprise.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.960
I would've never imagined you'd make such a decision.

09:44.690 --> 09:47.059
It actually scares me in a way.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.860
I'm doing it to save myself from the embarrassment.

09:49.090 --> 09:50.100
It's not for you.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.929
It's obvious that our relationship is hopeless.

09:54.500 --> 09:55.929
You can only be suggesting that...

09:56.169 --> 09:57.700
because we don't love each other at all.

09:58.299 --> 09:59.700
That is absolutely crazy.

09:59.970 --> 10:01.940
How can we keep on living together?

10:02.970 --> 10:04.309
I want you to keep raising Yun Jae.

10:04.679 --> 10:06.009
You're fond of him.

10:07.549 --> 10:10.120
Stop spewing such nonsense.

10:10.519 --> 10:13.080
- I will divorce you. - You can't.

10:13.220 --> 10:15.590
All you do is splurge my money. You can't even do anything else.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.320
How will you sustain yourself?

10:17.759 --> 10:19.590
What? Is he well- off?

10:19.990 --> 10:22.330
Hey, I want to know.

10:22.830 --> 10:25.500
That prick who beat me up at the parking lot.

10:25.799 --> 10:28.200
- It's that prick, isn't it? - Stop calling him a prick.

10:28.970 --> 10:30.970
Also, I will divorce you.

10:31.539 --> 10:33.669
I'll get alimony from you.

10:34.070 --> 10:35.169
I've looked into it, and it seems like...

10:35.340 --> 10:38.240
I'll get quite a bit if I apply for a division of property.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.659
- Where is Chairman Ahn? - He's asleep.

10:53.490 --> 10:56.029
- Bring a cup of chrysanthemum tea. - Sure.

11:03.129 --> 11:05.039
- Everything has been okay, right? - Yes.

11:05.870 --> 11:08.539
You already know about the younger son's family moving out.

11:10.409 --> 11:13.179
It's late, but congratulations on becoming the vice chairwoman.

11:13.649 --> 11:14.649
Thanks.

11:15.980 --> 11:19.750
There's something I heard when I was at Pungsuk's Kitchen.

11:20.250 --> 11:23.289
Apparently, there's a TCM doctor in Yongin who makes herbal medicine...

11:23.360 --> 11:24.789
that can help you conceive right away.

11:26.929 --> 11:28.289
I don't want to get pregnant.

11:31.559 --> 11:32.559
I won't have a baby.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.370
You wanted a baby though.

11:34.429 --> 11:35.830
I had a change of heart.

11:36.100 --> 11:39.440
I've found a faster way than using the baby to cash in.

11:40.870 --> 11:43.379
Then, what are your plans afterward?

11:45.580 --> 11:47.110
Don't ask me things like that anymore.

11:49.149 --> 11:50.179
Also,

11:52.019 --> 11:54.750
call me "Madam" even when it's just the two of us.

11:59.889 --> 12:01.830
Thank you for the tea, Ms. Cheon.

12:14.809 --> 12:16.409
(My beautiful daughter)

12:16.539 --> 12:19.710
Hi, sweetheart. Do you want to go on a date with me tomorrow?

13:20.769 --> 13:22.970
(Hi, sweetheart. Do you want to go on a date with me tomorrow?)

13:27.309 --> 13:29.480
Why does my dad live his life like that?

13:33.220 --> 13:34.690
Let's go. Let's do this.

14:04.980 --> 14:06.320
I'll think about it, Ms. Seo.

14:07.090 --> 14:10.019
I've always known that you're different from other women,

14:10.320 --> 14:11.960
but you really proved it this time.

14:12.659 --> 14:14.429
You're going cold turkey and moving on.

14:14.629 --> 14:16.730
Have you decided how you'll earn a living from now on?

14:16.830 --> 14:18.059
I'm thinking hard to figure it out.

14:18.629 --> 14:21.230
If that's the case, you should just work as an art consultant...

14:21.330 --> 14:24.340
at the gallery until you decide what you want to do.

14:25.470 --> 14:29.039
I'm not trying to help you. I'm doing it for the gallery.

14:30.279 --> 14:32.940
All right, I'll do it. I hope I'll be helpful.

14:33.110 --> 14:34.549
Of course, you will be.

14:35.779 --> 14:36.820
By the way,

14:37.450 --> 14:39.450
the prices of Yun Seong Hui's paintings have gone up.

14:40.950 --> 14:42.090
That's great.

14:42.519 --> 14:45.659
- Do you think so? - Yes. I'm very happy for her.

14:53.830 --> 14:55.529
Hello? Ju Mi.

15:00.940 --> 15:01.970
Where's Father?

15:02.570 --> 15:05.139
He went to the hospital and that woman went into the office.

15:05.879 --> 15:07.149
You know she's the vice chairwoman.

15:07.779 --> 15:10.480
She left without eating breakfast, saying she has to go to the factory.

15:10.850 --> 15:13.649
I'm sorry, Ju Mi. I didn't even get to say goodbye before I moved out.

15:13.750 --> 15:15.850
Are you closer with that woman now?

15:17.120 --> 15:19.759
Why do I have to find out about your divorce through her?

15:20.460 --> 15:21.789
My feelings are so hurt.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.929
I've been so out of it.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.470
She only found out about it by chance.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.629
I didn't tell her.

15:30.870 --> 15:33.909
I mean, it's not even good news. Why would I tell people myself?

15:35.539 --> 15:37.240
I'm sorry that I can't be of any help.

15:37.809 --> 15:39.840
No one could have helped.

15:52.460 --> 15:54.889
Jae Gu got arrested.

15:56.759 --> 15:59.360
- Why? - He got in trouble because of her.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.370
I heard he attempted to kill her.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.669
Things are not looking up...

16:03.970 --> 16:05.500
because of the firearm incident in the past.

16:07.940 --> 16:08.970
A Jin.

16:10.610 --> 16:11.909
Help me.

16:12.740 --> 16:14.149
Get Jae Gu out of there.

16:19.149 --> 16:20.990
I hate myself for having to ask you this.

16:24.889 --> 16:25.919
But...

16:28.960 --> 16:29.960
Un Gyu...

16:32.830 --> 16:34.100
I'm so worried about him.

16:36.269 --> 16:37.940
I understand what you're trying to tell me.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.539
I'll try talking to her.

16:42.210 --> 16:43.580
Thanks, A Jin.

16:47.110 --> 16:49.009
The house feels so empty without you.

16:50.179 --> 16:51.750
I didn't know I'd feel like this.

16:53.519 --> 16:57.389
It also breaks my heart that we won't be a family anymore.

17:05.130 --> 17:06.730
I'm home!

17:07.670 --> 17:10.170
I'm back.

17:16.309 --> 17:17.910
What is going on? Goodness.

17:19.910 --> 17:22.650
(Vice-chairwoman Park Ji Yeong)

17:29.650 --> 17:32.589
What's the matter? Did you come all the way here to see me?

17:34.029 --> 17:36.490
Did you have a change of heart by any chance?

17:37.200 --> 17:38.460
No, of course not.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.130
I came to ask you a favor.

17:42.170 --> 17:44.799
Please agree to settle with Jae Gu.

17:45.539 --> 17:47.809
Things got out of hand while I was at the hospital.

17:48.140 --> 17:50.710
I heard that he's now being charged with attempted murder...

17:51.079 --> 17:53.180
because he said himself that he did intend to kill me.

17:54.079 --> 17:57.420
The problem won't be resolved even if I decide to settle with him now.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.650
You need to give your statement as the victim.

18:01.420 --> 18:02.920
You've already been discharged.

18:03.519 --> 18:06.859
You said it will take four weeks to heal, but you got out within a week.

18:09.059 --> 18:11.559
Please tell the police that such a thing never happened.

18:11.730 --> 18:14.069
Then, he'll be acquitted for lack of evidence.

18:14.130 --> 18:15.329
Why do I have to do that?

18:15.430 --> 18:17.470
Is there a reason why you shouldn't?

18:31.680 --> 18:32.819
There was,

18:35.049 --> 18:36.490
but I'll change my mind...

18:37.660 --> 18:39.059
because you persuaded me.

18:43.329 --> 18:44.930
Let's see each other once in a while like this...

18:45.130 --> 18:46.769
even after you get divorced.

18:47.599 --> 18:49.400
I'd like that.

18:51.539 --> 18:52.839
Why do I have to do that?

18:53.970 --> 18:56.039
Is there a reason why you shouldn't?

18:57.839 --> 18:59.509
No, there's none.

19:00.009 --> 19:01.650
Sure, let's do that.

19:19.799 --> 19:21.269
Are you liking the room?

19:21.569 --> 19:22.599
Yes, madam.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.299
I'm sorry about that time.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.440
What do you mean?

19:27.470 --> 19:30.440
That time when Mr. Ahn...

19:31.380 --> 19:32.980
It's all in the past now.

19:33.349 --> 19:35.180
Besides, it was a misunderstanding anyway.

19:35.980 --> 19:38.519
Yes, madam. It was a misunderstanding.

19:38.579 --> 19:39.720
Don't worry about it.

19:40.990 --> 19:42.019
Just a moment.

19:48.089 --> 19:49.130
Do you want this?

19:49.960 --> 19:51.059
It's ruby.

19:51.730 --> 19:53.099
I think it will suit you.

20:01.670 --> 20:03.839
(Petition. Petitioner: Woo A Jin)

20:03.940 --> 20:05.980
(Summons, notice to appear for pretrial mediation)

20:10.950 --> 20:14.789
Mr. Ahn, Ms. Park will go to the police station and settle the case.

20:15.319 --> 20:18.690
Also, the sales have increased drastically as of late...

20:18.789 --> 20:21.930
Mr. Park, have you ever been divorced?

20:22.559 --> 20:24.259
No, not yet.

20:25.630 --> 20:26.769
I'm distraught.

20:29.099 --> 20:30.099
Goodness.

20:30.539 --> 20:32.299
It looks like you'll need a lawyer.

20:32.869 --> 20:33.910
Right?

20:47.319 --> 20:48.519
Hello, Mr. Han.

20:50.660 --> 20:52.559
Yes. I know it's still early in the day,

20:52.559 --> 20:54.190
but how about we grab a drink at that bar?

20:57.599 --> 21:01.200
People say that you get drunk faster when you drink in broad daylight.

21:01.269 --> 21:03.200
People need to know when to stop.

21:03.769 --> 21:07.240
Having that ability is important in order to succeed in this work.

21:07.670 --> 21:10.109
Breaking it off. Take what you need and pull out before it's late.

21:10.180 --> 21:11.410
You need to be good at that.

21:13.109 --> 21:15.210
Take what you need and pull out.

21:15.480 --> 21:17.450
Things are perfect for Daesung Pulp at the moment.

21:18.049 --> 21:20.319
Also, it'll be easy since it's still an unlisted company.

21:20.920 --> 21:23.190
Things have been going so well for them recently...

21:23.619 --> 21:24.920
that the stock value has gone up too.

21:25.859 --> 21:28.230
What exactly should I do?

21:28.930 --> 21:31.200
There is a group of ladies that gather regularly.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.230
They call themselves Seven Princesses.

21:33.930 --> 21:36.430
All the cash in this business practically belongs to them.

21:37.099 --> 21:41.140
They all started out with the money from selling their companies too.

21:42.640 --> 21:43.680
I'll help you out.

21:44.140 --> 21:47.480
It wouldn't be bad to have another princess join them.

21:49.880 --> 21:50.920
Cheers.

21:59.289 --> 22:01.559
My princess.

22:02.460 --> 22:03.900
Didn't you miss me?

22:08.799 --> 22:12.470
I miss you so much, my princess.

22:12.569 --> 22:14.109
Let's order ice cream first.

22:15.609 --> 22:17.109
I want the one I always get.

22:18.339 --> 22:19.339
All right.

22:23.210 --> 22:24.319
Ji Hu, I'm sorry.

22:24.849 --> 22:25.849
What for?

22:25.950 --> 22:27.349
For making you this uncomfortable.

22:35.589 --> 22:36.660
No, thanks.

22:42.170 --> 22:43.700
Stop that too.

22:51.910 --> 22:52.980
What is this?

22:53.609 --> 22:54.950
Why does this stink so much?

22:55.950 --> 22:57.180
No way. Again?

22:58.250 --> 22:59.279
Gosh.

22:59.450 --> 23:02.019
That can't be unless he has gone completely insane.

23:03.960 --> 23:06.690
When you do laundry, please wash these too.

23:08.690 --> 23:10.400
Are you nuts?

23:10.960 --> 23:11.960
Gosh.

23:15.829 --> 23:17.339
Jae Gu, spare me a second.

23:19.869 --> 23:20.910
Get out of my house.

23:20.940 --> 23:24.279
Move out with your wife and Un Gyu. I don't care where you go.

23:24.410 --> 23:26.539
- Why should I move out? - Don't you know the reason?

23:27.210 --> 23:30.779
I have to keep my wife safe and you might kill her.

23:31.480 --> 23:33.519
- I'm disowning you as of now. - Dad.

23:33.619 --> 23:34.750
Don't even call me your dad!

23:34.819 --> 23:36.019
Chairman Ahn.

23:38.319 --> 23:41.730
Give me half of the company shares.

23:41.960 --> 23:44.000
- What did you say? - I'm going to be blunt.

23:44.829 --> 23:48.400
If that woman puts poison in your food and kills you,

23:48.900 --> 23:50.569
who will inherit everything you have now?

23:50.740 --> 23:53.740
What did you just say? You son of a gun.

23:53.809 --> 23:56.369
You don't have to think of me as your son.

23:56.710 --> 23:57.710
But you know what?

23:58.210 --> 24:00.579
I have a wife and a son too.

24:00.650 --> 24:02.710
I need to provide for my family.

24:03.210 --> 24:04.220
Give me my shares.

24:04.579 --> 24:05.619
Then, I'll leave.

24:05.680 --> 24:07.950
I'd much rather find a homeless man on the street...

24:08.549 --> 24:10.259
and give him everything I own.

24:10.519 --> 24:12.690
I won't give you a single penny!

24:13.059 --> 24:14.059
You better remember that.

24:15.289 --> 24:18.500
I want you gone from my sight as of this moment.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
- Ms. Cheon. - Yes, sir.

24:22.069 --> 24:24.200
Starting now, don't make any food for this punk.

24:25.240 --> 24:26.599
And tell Mr. Kim to come here now.

24:26.809 --> 24:28.210
I want to go into the office.

24:28.470 --> 24:29.509
Yes, sir.

24:33.710 --> 24:35.079
He's arriving now?

24:35.650 --> 24:37.250
Okay. I get it, Mr. Kim.

24:40.619 --> 24:42.049
This is on me.

24:49.890 --> 24:50.930
Let's pull out now.

25:11.019 --> 25:13.180
There is a group of ladies that gather regularly.

25:13.420 --> 25:14.950
They all started out with the money...

25:15.150 --> 25:17.420
from selling their companies as well.

25:38.109 --> 25:39.910
Madam, it's me.

25:40.910 --> 25:43.420
Madam, it's me.

25:43.720 --> 25:46.819
(Summons, notice to appear for pretrial mediation)

25:47.420 --> 25:50.660
Mr. Kang, you have a client for consultation. It's a divorce case.

25:50.920 --> 25:51.960
Okay.

25:54.430 --> 25:56.029
- Welcome. - Hello.

26:00.569 --> 26:03.069
How can I help you?

26:03.230 --> 26:06.039
The situation I'm in is very urgent and I'm a busy person,

26:06.140 --> 26:07.710
so I thought I should see a lawyer right away.

26:12.609 --> 26:14.750
(Petition. Petitioner: Woo A Jin)

26:15.579 --> 26:17.150
(Respondent: Ahn Jae Seok)

26:17.250 --> 26:18.279
"Ahn Jae Seok"?

26:19.450 --> 26:20.490
Mr. Kang.

26:20.890 --> 26:23.789
I came all the way here to meet you because I heard you're...

26:23.890 --> 26:25.589
a true lawyer who defends the powerless.

26:25.990 --> 26:28.329
I've been backed into a corner.

26:28.990 --> 26:30.029
Well...

26:30.599 --> 26:32.829
Why did you want to consult me?

26:33.730 --> 26:37.339
I mean, who told you about me?

26:38.670 --> 26:39.700
(Petition)

26:40.339 --> 26:42.670
- Hello, Dr. Jang. - Hey, Mr. Ahn.

26:42.910 --> 26:44.910
- How have you been? - I'm not well.

26:45.480 --> 26:46.539
Why? What's going on?

26:46.609 --> 26:50.349
I'm calling because I need to find a good lawyer.

26:50.420 --> 26:52.619
Our company has a legal advisor and I know a few lawyers too,

26:52.779 --> 26:56.190
but I'm going through something a little embarrassing.

26:56.390 --> 26:59.289
I need someone who is discreet and warmhearted. Most importantly...

26:59.759 --> 27:02.190
Well, someone who can be on the same page emotionally with me...

27:02.490 --> 27:03.759
and lead the conversation.

27:03.859 --> 27:06.000
Someone who's on the same page as you emotionally.

27:06.869 --> 27:07.900
Hang on, okay?

27:07.900 --> 27:11.140
My eyes are turning back.

27:11.200 --> 27:14.369
A friend of mine is a plastic surgeon. I'll introduce you to him.

27:14.509 --> 27:17.079
Yes. Please take good care of her, Dr. Jang.

27:17.740 --> 27:18.740
A lawyer?

27:18.910 --> 27:20.549
- Hello? - Hey.

27:20.650 --> 27:23.210
Give me that lawyer's number.

27:24.650 --> 27:26.220
The kindhearted lawyer in the area.

27:27.720 --> 27:29.150
- Him? - Cheers.

27:29.349 --> 27:31.789
Nothing can beat the champagne we had at the yacht party.

27:33.259 --> 27:35.859
Right. I saw our photos from the yacht party...

27:35.960 --> 27:38.000
on a travel agency's website.

27:38.099 --> 27:40.000
That's copyright infringement.

27:40.069 --> 27:42.329
I know, right? Do you know any lawyers?

27:42.400 --> 27:45.670
I do know a caring lawyer who takes all cases that come his way.

27:45.839 --> 27:46.869
Put me in touch with him.

27:47.910 --> 27:50.279
(Law office of Kang Gi Ho, Kang Gi Ho, attorney at law)

27:50.380 --> 27:53.450
Who told you to consult me?

27:53.650 --> 27:55.710
That's not important.

27:55.950 --> 27:59.380
Mr. Kang, I need a lawyer who is empathetic enough to understand...

27:59.549 --> 28:01.750
and relate to my current emotional state.

28:01.819 --> 28:04.089
Someone who won't try to make me understand the legal...

28:04.160 --> 28:06.960
- In other words... - Excuse me, Mr. Ahn Jae Seok.

28:07.789 --> 28:11.829
I have no interest in understanding your current emotional state.

28:12.259 --> 28:15.630
First off, I refuse to be your legal representative.

28:16.069 --> 28:17.670
What? Why?

28:18.369 --> 28:19.839
I'm speechless.

28:21.039 --> 28:22.569
- Please leave. - Look.

28:22.670 --> 28:25.079
You're being ridiculous. Gosh, I can't believe this.

28:25.140 --> 28:29.380
Soon, you'll find out why I can't be your legal representative.

28:30.019 --> 28:32.750
I hope you can find another lawyer soon.

28:33.279 --> 28:34.289
Goodbye.

28:35.220 --> 28:37.420
- Look, you will... - Please get out!

28:50.200 --> 28:52.599
As soon as I deal with the pressing matters,

28:52.700 --> 28:55.569
I'll find corresponding sections in the Civil Act and sue you.

28:55.940 --> 28:58.740
This is a clear case of defamation. Do you know that?

29:04.380 --> 29:07.150
Gosh. That guy has problems.

29:07.220 --> 29:10.519
He's a total fool. What is wrong with him?

29:10.920 --> 29:12.190
What does that jerk want from me?

29:12.720 --> 29:13.930
Why did he come here?

29:14.430 --> 29:15.589
I don't get it.

29:16.089 --> 29:17.460
What is his problem?

29:17.559 --> 29:19.099
Gosh, nothing is going my way.

29:19.160 --> 29:21.670
I've never seen such a fool before. That little...

29:23.440 --> 29:26.170
I can buy this whole place if I want to.

29:30.579 --> 29:34.180
The sales have increased immensely and the shareholders...

29:34.309 --> 29:37.150
deeply respect and trust Ms. Park.

29:40.750 --> 29:41.750
Chairman Ahn.

29:50.460 --> 29:51.599
You're here.

29:59.569 --> 30:02.470
It's refreshing to see each other here, don't you think?

30:02.569 --> 30:04.539
You're the reason I live.

30:05.009 --> 30:07.650
You've also completely turned the company around.

30:08.809 --> 30:11.180
Getting my achievements recognized by you makes...

30:12.250 --> 30:14.319
all the hard work worth it.

30:15.190 --> 30:16.390
But...

30:17.059 --> 30:19.319
I do have the vice chairwoman title, but in reality,

30:19.819 --> 30:21.630
I don't even have any shares.

30:22.190 --> 30:24.930
All the shareholders treat me like a puppet.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.900
They don't even do anything.

30:27.400 --> 30:28.569
Don't be too upset.

30:28.799 --> 30:30.740
I've actually been thinking about making some changes.

30:32.940 --> 30:34.009
Really?

30:35.440 --> 30:36.440
Bok Ja.

30:37.009 --> 30:39.680
Yes, go ahead.

30:39.880 --> 30:42.880
I rarely see you these days because you're so busy.

30:43.549 --> 30:45.650
My life is so boring and dull without you around.

30:45.720 --> 30:48.490
Gosh, please don't be like this.

30:48.849 --> 30:51.690
Why do you think I'm working so hard?

30:51.960 --> 30:54.329
The company has to operate like a well- oiled machine...

30:54.390 --> 30:57.859
for you to feel at ease and live a stress- free life.

30:58.230 --> 31:00.900
Then, you'll be able to regain your health quickly as well.

31:01.569 --> 31:03.769
I have to make sure that happens so that we can enjoy...

31:03.900 --> 31:06.269
a long and fun life together.

31:06.670 --> 31:07.710
I know.

31:08.170 --> 31:10.680
I know how much you care about me.

31:11.109 --> 31:13.309
So, please be patient for just a little longer.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.349
As soon as things in the company become stable...

31:16.980 --> 31:19.380
Right, it'll take some time for that to happen...

31:19.480 --> 31:21.519
because no one listens to me now.

31:22.450 --> 31:23.789
Okay, all right.

31:24.059 --> 31:26.089
I'll change some things around...

31:26.519 --> 31:27.829
so that everyone will have to listen to you.

31:32.130 --> 31:34.299
Since we haven't had pork rinds in a while,

31:34.529 --> 31:37.869
I should ask Ms. Cheon to prepare some for dinner tonight.

32:00.990 --> 32:03.630
It feels weird to meet up with you at a place like this.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.400
Why did you want to meet here?

32:06.829 --> 32:07.869
The two of us...

32:10.170 --> 32:11.339
What are we?

32:12.269 --> 32:14.670
- What do you mean? - Aren't we in a relationship?

32:15.269 --> 32:16.269
A relationship?

32:18.539 --> 32:21.410
Hyo Ju, why are you being like this? Don't be such an amateur.

32:22.680 --> 32:24.819
Yes, I like you.

32:25.150 --> 32:27.450
I can't sleep with a woman I don't even like,

32:28.190 --> 32:30.289
but you can't call that a relationship.

32:30.460 --> 32:31.460
So,

32:32.720 --> 32:36.559
are you saying that what we had was more like a business transaction?

32:37.359 --> 32:39.900
Don't put it that way. I'm not that kind of guy.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.329
That's basically what you're saying.

32:42.329 --> 32:44.099
You said we can't call it a relationship.

32:45.400 --> 32:46.470
Hey, by any chance,

32:47.740 --> 32:50.279
do you really like me?

32:52.740 --> 32:55.950
Why are you being like this? I didn't think you'd be this uncool.

32:56.750 --> 32:57.750
Sorry.

32:57.920 --> 32:58.920
Hyo Ju.

32:59.319 --> 33:00.690
Let's be cool about it, okay?

33:01.420 --> 33:03.960
Wasn't it about getting what we need from each other?

33:04.220 --> 33:05.589
Do you want to control me now or what?

33:07.289 --> 33:08.289
You're right.

33:09.890 --> 33:11.460
I shouldn't try to control you.

33:11.559 --> 33:12.700
Where shall we meet next week?

33:13.670 --> 33:15.099
I'll call you. You should get going now.

33:17.700 --> 33:20.369
I have to go to my kid's school to meet with his teacher.

33:20.940 --> 33:23.339
Right, you're a mom.

33:24.279 --> 33:26.109
I forget about it from time to time.

33:27.710 --> 33:28.710
Call me.

33:37.990 --> 33:39.289
You told me that the gallery...

33:39.460 --> 33:41.490
will take care of the shipping cost and publicity expenses...

33:41.559 --> 33:44.400
and that I'll get 40 percent of what my paintings were sold for.

33:44.660 --> 33:47.369
Of course. I even signed the contract.

33:47.730 --> 33:50.000
- Then, why... - You should speak with A Jin.

33:50.069 --> 33:53.670
She told me that I have to discuss with her first when it comes...

33:53.839 --> 33:55.369
to anything related to your payouts.

33:56.140 --> 33:58.480
She said that she's sort of like your agent.

33:58.579 --> 34:00.750
No. That's not true, Ms. Seo. You have to speak with me.

34:00.809 --> 34:03.009
Just talk to A Jin and get things cleared up.

34:04.119 --> 34:06.420
Who does she think she is? I can't believe she's stealing my pay.

34:06.480 --> 34:09.719
Then, why did you steal her husband?

34:10.659 --> 34:11.659
Sorry?

34:14.630 --> 34:16.059
When you get a little older,

34:16.699 --> 34:19.829
you'll realize that life is like a boomerang.

34:27.469 --> 34:30.110
I know that it's not my place to say anything,

34:30.610 --> 34:32.510
but as you know, the annex is empty now.

34:33.210 --> 34:36.510
How about you have your husband stay there for the time being?

34:40.989 --> 34:42.289
I should go, madam.

34:42.849 --> 34:44.860
All right. Yes, you should go.

34:46.219 --> 34:47.389
Thank you.

35:01.539 --> 35:02.639
Make sure Jae Gu moves out.

35:06.639 --> 35:08.780
I'll let Jae Gu stay at the annex.

35:09.010 --> 35:10.820
I think that will be better.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.630
What did you do with my paintings in the room?

35:23.800 --> 35:24.800
I put them away.

35:25.760 --> 35:27.829
Give them back. Right now.

35:27.969 --> 35:30.739
I'll keep them until the situation here gets sorted out.

35:30.840 --> 35:34.039
- Who says you can keep them? - Well, I can do whatever I want.

35:34.170 --> 35:35.239
Give them back.

35:35.409 --> 35:38.340
Also, why did you steal my payout from the gallery?

35:38.409 --> 35:40.210
Watch your mouth. I never stole anything.

35:40.280 --> 35:41.949
You know that you need to settle up with me.

35:42.050 --> 35:44.449
I just put a hold on that payment. I'm not like you.

35:45.250 --> 35:49.219
Ask your darling his opinion on what you should do in this situation.

35:50.219 --> 35:52.289
Dear, my paintings...

35:52.460 --> 35:54.260
I painted them, so they're mine, right?

35:54.329 --> 35:56.829
I'm keeping them for letting you take my husband.

35:56.900 --> 35:58.530
My husband is such a wonderful man.

35:58.630 --> 36:01.199
You'll find no other man like him.

36:01.300 --> 36:03.000
Isn't that why you stole him?

36:03.070 --> 36:04.840
He's worth way more than those stupid paintings.

36:05.639 --> 36:07.369
Dear, say something.

36:07.510 --> 36:08.840
Tell her whose paintings are they.

36:11.980 --> 36:13.610
I'm not King Solomon,

36:13.780 --> 36:16.820
- but if you two split them... - What?

36:16.920 --> 36:19.019
What is wrong with you? Hey.

36:19.119 --> 36:21.489
- Those two are ridiculous. - What? Split the paintings?

36:21.590 --> 36:24.360
- How can you talk such nonsense? - You should have said,

36:24.460 --> 36:26.360
"No, you just keep those paintings."

36:26.460 --> 36:28.260
That's how King Solomon found the real mother...

36:29.489 --> 36:33.530
Poor me. I pity my life. Gosh.

36:39.800 --> 36:40.809
Jae Gu.

36:41.170 --> 36:42.409
I heard there are empty rooms here.

36:42.739 --> 36:44.610
- Are you going to stay here? - Yes.

37:06.769 --> 37:08.869
- Have you had dinner yet? - What about you?

37:09.269 --> 37:12.699
I have if you've eaten, but I haven't if that's not the case.

37:12.869 --> 37:14.210
Then, I guess you haven't eaten yet.

37:14.340 --> 37:15.710
Let's go. I'll treat you.

37:18.179 --> 37:19.739
- Excuse me. - Yes.

37:25.250 --> 37:28.820
What do you think? I bet he's probably drinking somewhere alone.

37:29.449 --> 37:32.989
What can you do? It's not like you can spank your grown-up son.

37:35.860 --> 37:39.300
It doesn't really go well with wine,

37:39.559 --> 37:41.829
but you know we have fond memories of it.

37:42.630 --> 37:46.599
I heard such shared memories are what makes breakups so devastating.

37:46.969 --> 37:50.039
I wonder if Jae Seok is heartbroken at all.

37:51.210 --> 37:52.510
That crazy fool.

37:53.110 --> 37:54.210
That crazy fool.

37:57.949 --> 38:00.550
You said that you'll kick him out of the company.

38:01.150 --> 38:03.320
Will you actually do it?

38:03.420 --> 38:05.860
Of course, I have to. You're there now.

38:05.989 --> 38:08.130
You cleaned up the mess he made.

38:08.230 --> 38:10.329
I must make sure he can never mess things up again.

38:12.300 --> 38:13.800
If that's the case,

38:14.869 --> 38:16.400
when will you do it?

38:17.300 --> 38:20.000
- What did you just say? - I also couldn't believe my eyes...

38:20.110 --> 38:21.469
when I read that petition.

38:21.869 --> 38:24.840
That is crazy. There are so many lawyers in Seoul.

38:25.380 --> 38:27.250
Don't you think he came to see me on purpose?

38:27.880 --> 38:29.110
No way.

38:29.110 --> 38:30.679
He could've talked to the legal advisor.

38:31.050 --> 38:32.880
Why do you think he came to see me?

38:35.150 --> 38:38.420
I know that this is a terrible question,

38:39.260 --> 38:40.260
but I'll ask you anyway.

38:41.530 --> 38:44.360
What did you like about that man?

38:44.960 --> 38:46.300
I mean, you married him.

38:50.900 --> 38:52.139
The weight of marriage.

38:52.670 --> 38:54.210
You mentioned it the other day.

38:55.409 --> 38:59.010
You said that the weight must be different for the two of us.

39:00.949 --> 39:02.650
But then, I started wondering...

39:03.280 --> 39:06.550
if I really took marriage a lot more seriously than he did.

39:08.320 --> 39:09.420
The answer is no.

39:10.789 --> 39:13.630
I'm also partially responsible for all the choices that brought us...

39:14.090 --> 39:15.260
to where we are now.

39:21.030 --> 39:22.070
Mr. Ahn.

39:22.369 --> 39:23.440
Mr. Ahn!

39:25.670 --> 39:28.510
Gosh, it looks like you drank a lot. You should have called a chauffeur.

39:29.010 --> 39:30.539
Why did you call me?

39:31.840 --> 39:33.849
My dear Mr. Park is here.

39:35.349 --> 39:36.349
Mr. Park.

39:36.920 --> 39:38.019
I'm...

39:38.920 --> 39:41.219
I'm so lonely.

39:42.789 --> 39:46.760
I feel as if my heart has been shot by a bullet.

39:50.400 --> 39:51.400
You see.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.269
I went to a lawyer's office earlier today to hire him,

39:56.630 --> 39:59.239
but something very surprising happened there.

40:00.210 --> 40:04.539
Do you know what he said? He refused to represent me.

40:04.679 --> 40:05.679
Pardon?

40:07.050 --> 40:10.050
The world is just so cruel to me right now.

40:10.119 --> 40:12.050
Why did he refuse to represent you?

40:13.219 --> 40:15.489
Could it have been because there's a slim chance that you'll win?

40:15.590 --> 40:18.860
No, it's not that. He didn't even hear my story.

40:19.789 --> 40:21.960
He started verbally bashing me as soon as he saw my face

40:22.130 --> 40:24.300
and my name on the petition.

40:24.630 --> 40:27.769
Even a lawyer lashed out at me.

40:29.199 --> 40:30.969
My dad lashed out at me too.

40:31.699 --> 40:33.300
And my daughter is completely ignoring me now.

40:34.210 --> 40:36.739
My wife is also...

40:39.880 --> 40:40.909
Mr. Ahn.

40:41.550 --> 40:45.079
Mr. Ahn, I'll drive you home. Okay?

40:47.349 --> 40:49.519
When did things start to go wrong?

40:49.690 --> 40:52.889
What do you think? The day when you kissed that artist.

40:53.119 --> 40:54.860
I think that's when things started to go haywire.

40:54.929 --> 40:56.460
That wasn't our first kiss.

40:56.800 --> 40:58.929
- Sorry? - We actually...

41:00.800 --> 41:03.000
Our first kiss was way before that.

41:03.440 --> 41:06.170
You caught us kissing a while after the first one.

41:08.309 --> 41:09.869
I'll give you a ride if you'll leave now,

41:09.869 --> 41:11.440
but I have to get going otherwise.

41:11.539 --> 41:13.510
I have to go home and bathe my baby.

41:13.579 --> 41:15.550
Don't do this to me. Don't leave me.

41:15.650 --> 41:17.719
- Goodness gracious. - Please...

41:47.679 --> 41:49.880
- Did Jae Gu move into that house? - Yes.

41:50.219 --> 41:53.750
I left a blanket and pillow there for him as you asked.

41:53.889 --> 41:56.389
Great. Thank you.

41:56.590 --> 41:57.789
Also, thanks for calling me.

41:57.889 --> 41:59.519
No problem at all, madam.

42:00.590 --> 42:01.929
You don't even need to thank me.

42:02.159 --> 42:03.500
You've been talking to A Jin's housekeeper...

42:03.500 --> 42:04.960
often on the phone, right?

42:05.059 --> 42:06.130
Yes, madam.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.900
All of them will be gathered at that house very soon.

42:09.969 --> 42:12.340
- Pardon me? - The three little pigs.

42:29.219 --> 42:32.690
Sir, it'll be great if you can drive a bit slowly.

42:35.159 --> 42:36.159
Mr. Ahn.

42:36.900 --> 42:38.199
Where should I drop you off?

42:38.260 --> 42:40.599
- Drop me off at my place. - Which one?

42:40.769 --> 42:42.599
What do you mean? Take me home!

42:42.730 --> 42:45.800
Right, but you have many homes.

42:46.070 --> 42:47.739
Where should I take you?

42:47.840 --> 42:50.809
You're right. I have many homes.

42:54.010 --> 42:56.150
I do have many homes.

43:19.670 --> 43:21.539
You know that the litigation has begun, right?

43:21.969 --> 43:22.969
Please play it fair.

43:23.039 --> 43:24.079
What do you mean?

43:24.809 --> 43:26.610
Too bad if you didn't understand what I meant.

43:26.949 --> 43:29.710
By the way, is Mr. Ahn not home yet?

43:29.849 --> 43:30.880
No.

43:31.150 --> 43:32.750
I was going to say hello if he was home.

43:33.449 --> 43:34.489
I'll get going then.

43:40.389 --> 43:43.289
Where is this man? Why isn't he home yet?

43:57.639 --> 43:59.480
Ms. Woo, come have some food.

43:59.610 --> 44:00.880
I'll wash up first.

44:03.380 --> 44:05.019
It doesn't look like he came home last night.

44:05.250 --> 44:07.849
His cycling clothes are still hung on the drying rack too.

44:22.170 --> 44:23.269
Where is Ms. Jo?

44:23.670 --> 44:25.170
I told her to go over to the annex.

44:25.469 --> 44:29.510
All three of your children are there right now.

44:30.480 --> 44:32.510
They can't even look after themselves.

44:32.710 --> 44:35.349
Who is going to cook and do laundry?

44:38.150 --> 44:40.989
You're doing that again. I told you not to get upset like this.

44:41.449 --> 44:44.289
You said you'd just think that you have no children.

44:44.360 --> 44:46.090
They are the bane of my existence.

44:47.130 --> 44:50.760
I know that they're my children, but none of them is decent.

44:51.099 --> 44:53.699
I trusted A Jin,

44:53.829 --> 44:55.369
but even she wants a divorce.

44:57.340 --> 44:58.500
What will happen after I die?

44:59.300 --> 45:01.610
They obviously won't be able to run the company properly.

45:01.840 --> 45:05.239
The company will fall apart and become worthless.

45:08.349 --> 45:10.280
That being said...

45:11.949 --> 45:12.980
Honey.

45:13.619 --> 45:16.489
Shall we just let it all go...

45:16.960 --> 45:19.260
and go on a cruise?

45:19.559 --> 45:21.989
- A cruise? - Why should we grow the business?

45:22.090 --> 45:24.500
None of your children is competent enough to inherit it.

45:24.829 --> 45:28.699
Since the company is doing so well now, you should sell it...

45:28.800 --> 45:30.869
and keep the cash.

45:31.500 --> 45:33.199
Do you think I should sell the company?

45:33.670 --> 45:37.980
I've been meeting a lot of businessmen through my MBA program.

45:38.480 --> 45:41.250
Acquisitions, mergers, and selling companies.

45:41.409 --> 45:45.519
The wisest strategy is to find the right times to do those things.

45:45.619 --> 45:47.920
They say you should make hay while the sun shines.

45:48.150 --> 45:52.219
Now is the perfect time to seek such opportunities for our company.

45:59.500 --> 46:01.530
Gosh, never mind. Forget what I just said.

46:01.630 --> 46:04.300
Sorry, I shouldn't have said any of it.

46:05.199 --> 46:07.639
Please don't let it bother you.

46:08.110 --> 46:09.739
What is life all about anyway?

46:09.969 --> 46:13.550
We should just enjoy good food like this...

46:13.650 --> 46:16.179
and try to have fun.

46:17.380 --> 46:19.150
Try this. It's braised beef brisket.

46:30.659 --> 46:31.659
Dear.

46:33.300 --> 46:34.969
You see, if...

46:35.530 --> 46:36.800
If what?

46:37.099 --> 46:38.170
If...

46:39.500 --> 46:41.110
If I sell the company...

46:41.940 --> 46:44.340
like you said,

46:45.679 --> 46:47.980
I'll be harshly criticized for it for the rest of my life.

46:48.679 --> 46:51.420
I'm also worried what my employees will think of me.

46:52.179 --> 46:55.190
Why are you worried? You have me.

46:57.219 --> 46:58.260
You?

46:58.960 --> 47:01.090
Just use me.

47:01.730 --> 47:04.329
You can hide behind me.

47:04.829 --> 47:06.769
I'll take all the blame.

47:08.329 --> 47:11.869
I'll be your shield. It's the least I can do for you.

47:19.480 --> 47:21.510
So? Have you found out anything?

47:21.750 --> 47:25.019
Yes, sir. I tailed her for 12 hours and gathered information...

47:25.420 --> 47:26.690
on the guy she's seeing.

47:27.150 --> 47:28.150
Really?

47:28.690 --> 47:29.849
What does he do for a living?

47:36.289 --> 47:38.159
- I miss you. - Let go of me.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.670
Can't we keep seeing each other?

47:42.969 --> 47:44.840
You don't love me.

47:45.199 --> 47:46.369
You just want to hold me.

47:46.500 --> 47:48.239
It's the same thing. What's the difference?

47:49.139 --> 47:51.909
I met up with your wife. I won't see you anymore.

47:52.039 --> 47:53.849
No, I can't.

47:54.380 --> 47:55.610
I'll take responsibility for the baby if you want me to.

47:55.809 --> 47:57.880
If it's mine, that is.

47:58.079 --> 47:59.079
Forget it.

47:59.849 --> 48:02.750
Just be good to your wife from now on.

48:02.849 --> 48:04.789
- Gyeong Hui. - Your wife...

48:05.559 --> 48:06.789
loves you.

48:09.159 --> 48:12.599
I don't want to be bad anymore.

48:14.269 --> 48:16.400
I'll change your name from Seong Ju...

48:17.539 --> 48:19.300
to Dr. Jang on my phone.

48:19.500 --> 48:21.840
You should just delete my number.

48:23.010 --> 48:24.010
Hey.

48:24.710 --> 48:26.139
Do you have another man?

48:28.010 --> 48:29.250
Why do you think so?

48:29.650 --> 48:32.019
The guy who beat up your husband to a pulp at the parking lot.

48:33.019 --> 48:34.119
Who is he?

48:35.550 --> 48:38.289
Everyone thinks that it was your doing.

48:39.489 --> 48:41.630
Why are you asking me?

48:44.000 --> 48:46.829
I'll visit your clinic if I ever need Botox injections.

48:47.630 --> 48:50.340
That will probably the only time you'll ever see me.

48:53.440 --> 48:56.170
We're already here. Are you really going to leave like this?

48:57.610 --> 48:59.510
I'm not an animal like you, okay?

49:23.769 --> 49:25.639
So, I kept tailing that guy.

49:25.769 --> 49:27.039
And?

49:27.170 --> 49:28.739
He went to a plastic surgery clinic.

49:29.010 --> 49:30.010
What?

49:32.039 --> 49:34.710
By any chance, was it J Top Plastic Surgery?

49:36.550 --> 49:37.550
Yes.

49:45.719 --> 49:47.059
What a crazy fool.

49:47.889 --> 49:49.260
There's a thing called morals.

49:49.630 --> 49:51.300
He can't do that.

49:55.099 --> 49:57.840
- Ms. Woo, do you must get divorced? - Yes.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.670
Your husband really wants the family to stay together.

50:00.769 --> 50:02.110
He does.

50:02.239 --> 50:04.710
The problem is that he also wants to stay with that woman.

50:07.679 --> 50:09.179
Here's what I think.

50:09.510 --> 50:11.019
Marriage is a lot like running a marathon.

50:11.519 --> 50:14.219
I became thirsty after running for about ten years.

50:14.449 --> 50:15.719
Hence, I drank some water.

50:16.090 --> 50:19.420
I got full of the water, so I sat down and took a little break.

50:19.559 --> 50:21.889
That doesn't mean I'll give up the marathon.

50:22.860 --> 50:25.099
What does getting divorced have to do with running a marathon?

50:25.159 --> 50:27.869
Gosh, you and I are just not communicating here.

50:28.369 --> 50:32.199
This is exactly why I'm looking for a lawyer who can empathize with me.

50:33.940 --> 50:35.940
Did he have an affair?

50:36.039 --> 50:38.139
Yes, it's still ongoing.

50:38.210 --> 50:40.650
Mr. Ahn, are you still cheating on your wife?

50:40.849 --> 50:44.320
Of course. I'm a very responsible person.

50:44.719 --> 50:45.719
I can't leave that woman.

50:45.849 --> 50:47.849
Then, just agree to the divorce.

50:48.219 --> 50:49.550
Divorce? No.

50:49.949 --> 50:52.260
My wife and my daughter matter the most to me.

50:52.320 --> 50:53.320
I can't agree to the divorce.

50:53.320 --> 50:55.730
You can't agree to the divorce, but you'll keep having an affair.

50:55.789 --> 50:56.960
Is that what you're saying?

50:57.199 --> 50:59.599
Yes, I guess that's the gist of what I'm trying to say.

50:59.960 --> 51:01.929
It's impossible to mediate this dispute.

51:03.500 --> 51:05.139
If that's the case, just go to trial.

51:05.269 --> 51:06.969
Please help us find a solution.

51:07.039 --> 51:09.469
Solution, my foot. You keep talking complete nonsense.

51:10.780 --> 51:13.010
We should find another mediator.

51:27.030 --> 51:28.929
Tell Lawyer Kim to come meet me here today.

51:28.989 --> 51:30.030
Yes, sir.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.769
The company's legal advisor is coming to meet with Chairman Ahn.

51:33.829 --> 51:35.969
I want to know if Mr. Ahn is in his office now.

51:36.030 --> 51:38.300
Please ask Mr. Park.

51:38.440 --> 51:41.670
I already asked. He's not here today because of his divorce mediation.

51:43.840 --> 51:45.539
The universe is helping me.

51:48.610 --> 51:51.179
Chairman Ahn should know about it too. Please go tell him now.

51:51.380 --> 51:54.019
Yes, madam. I mean, Ms. Vice-chairwoman.

52:03.059 --> 52:04.630
- You're... - What did I tell you?

52:05.000 --> 52:06.900
I said that you'll soon find out why...

52:06.969 --> 52:08.369
I can't be your legal representative.

52:08.829 --> 52:10.639
See you later. Let's go.

52:11.170 --> 52:13.440
What the hell is going on now? Hey.

52:13.769 --> 52:14.769
You better stop right there.

52:20.809 --> 52:22.309
The floor is so slippery.

52:26.179 --> 52:28.949
I've been wondering whether I should tell you this.

52:30.690 --> 52:33.090
Dr. Jang is the man your wife has been seeing.

52:34.929 --> 52:36.289
Remember the group our wives made?

52:36.929 --> 52:39.599
The director of the plastic surgery clinic. It's him.

52:41.300 --> 52:42.300
Sorry?

52:43.000 --> 52:45.440
It sure is easy to miss what's in front of you. Isn't it crazy?

52:45.769 --> 52:47.510
That must have been why she met with his wife...

52:47.610 --> 52:48.710
Gosh.

52:50.440 --> 52:54.349
Does that mean he hired someone to beat me up like that?

52:55.079 --> 52:56.679
Well, I guess so.

52:58.679 --> 53:01.420
I didn't think he could do such a thing, but he's not a good guy.

53:01.519 --> 53:03.050
I mean, there are so many women.

53:03.389 --> 53:06.260
Why did it have to be the mother of his son's friend?

53:26.340 --> 53:28.010
Sir, I heard that you wanted to see me.

53:28.480 --> 53:29.980
Prepare an assignment agreement.

53:30.219 --> 53:33.250
I'd like to transfer all my shares to Vice-chairwoman Park Bok Ja...

53:33.889 --> 53:37.019
I mean, Park Ji Yeong. I'd like to give them to her.

53:37.719 --> 53:39.760
- Sir. - And notify the company too.

53:39.860 --> 53:42.860
They'll have a new major shareholder when the transfer is completed.

53:43.090 --> 53:45.059
We'll try to sell the company right after that.

53:45.559 --> 53:47.630
It's confidential for now, so keep it to yourself.

53:47.730 --> 53:50.940
I think Chairman Ahn told him to prepare an assignment agreement.

53:51.139 --> 53:53.940
He said he'd like to transfer all of his shares to you.

54:02.980 --> 54:04.050
This is so good.

54:05.380 --> 54:08.489
Jae Gu, how much do you want?

54:09.989 --> 54:11.420
Half.

54:11.960 --> 54:12.960
Are you crazy?

54:13.530 --> 54:15.559
What will I get if Dad gives you half?

54:16.090 --> 54:17.530
Dad lost so much money because of you.

54:17.599 --> 54:20.630
By the way, why on earth is Jae Seok staying here?

54:20.730 --> 54:21.869
He has his place.

54:21.929 --> 54:24.739
I know, right? Isn't he so pathetic?

54:24.800 --> 54:26.500
Don't even get me started.

54:30.110 --> 54:32.110
Hey. Jae Hui!

54:41.519 --> 54:42.519
Hello.

54:42.989 --> 54:45.719
The non bis in idem principle. Have you heard of it?

54:46.420 --> 54:48.929
- Pardon me? - The police already think...

54:49.230 --> 54:51.260
that you tried to hurt that woman as per my order.

54:52.630 --> 54:53.969
Let it be the case.

54:54.599 --> 54:55.929
Let's actually do it.

54:57.170 --> 54:59.769
- Madam. - Go break her.

55:00.670 --> 55:03.139
I must teach that woman a lesson.

55:03.610 --> 55:04.679
Will you be able to do it?

55:05.210 --> 55:06.239
No.

55:06.949 --> 55:08.179
You have to do it.

55:10.619 --> 55:12.420
We must not let her go any further...

55:13.119 --> 55:14.889
or have her way.

55:15.989 --> 55:17.320
Cripple her.

55:25.329 --> 55:26.329
Hey.

55:26.769 --> 55:28.630
What time did you say Ms. Morinake will be here?

55:29.929 --> 55:31.269
She should be arriving any minute now.

55:35.610 --> 55:36.610
This is...

55:36.610 --> 55:39.510
the art consultant who introduced the painting, War II,

55:39.610 --> 55:41.510
to our gallery.

55:41.750 --> 55:43.880
Hello, I'm Woo A Jin.

55:44.949 --> 55:48.190
You have a good eye and you're strikingly beautiful too.

55:48.289 --> 55:51.460
Not at all. Thank you for your kind words.

55:52.219 --> 55:55.190
She would like to take a look at a few more paintings.

55:55.360 --> 55:57.500
- Help her select the best ones. - Shall I?

55:58.400 --> 55:59.699
Please give me a moment.

55:59.829 --> 56:02.730
I'll go prepare a few samples that you may find helpful.

56:02.929 --> 56:06.199
I'll trust your keen eye for art once again.

56:22.150 --> 56:24.489
Well, I hope this is not a discourteous thing to ask.

56:25.119 --> 56:28.530
Would you allow me to embellish your shoes if you trust my taste?

56:34.829 --> 56:37.000
Everything is in your hands now.

56:37.139 --> 56:38.570
Please don't worry.

56:38.869 --> 56:40.309
Just trust me.

56:42.369 --> 56:43.409
Let's get it done.

58:08.530 --> 58:10.400
I think you've been kicked out.

58:10.500 --> 58:12.329
Why didn't anyone tell me about that?

58:12.400 --> 58:14.730
I told you. Ms. Park told me to inform you about it.

58:14.900 --> 58:16.869
Don't trust Park Bok Ja too much.

58:16.940 --> 58:20.170
Is it true she had a daughter with leukemia?

58:20.239 --> 58:23.070
Everything she told you is a lie. Please be careful with her.

58:23.170 --> 58:25.940
I'll give you proper compensation for this house, so get out.

58:26.039 --> 58:27.380
Hey, mistress.

58:27.579 --> 58:30.380
I was going to wrap things up and leave quietly,

58:30.449 --> 58:32.280
but you picked a fight with me first.

58:32.380 --> 58:34.190
I won't let anyone take you from me.

58:34.489 --> 58:35.690
Is it me or that woman?

58:35.789 --> 58:38.289
I'm abandoning you now.

58:38.489 --> 58:41.230
Get out of this house first thing in the morning.

58:41.829 --> 58:44.000
Bong Sik won't let Dr. Jang get away with this.

58:44.099 --> 58:45.329
He even got her pregnant.

58:45.460 --> 58:47.070
This is no ordinary matter.

58:47.199 --> 58:50.139
I'll make my next move as quietly as possible.

58:50.400 --> 58:53.570
Then, I'll get things ready for the next step as quietly as possible.

58:53.769 --> 58:56.909
I love my wife. And I don't want this divorce.

58:56.980 --> 58:59.139
A Jin, I love you.

58:59.710 --> 59:03.250
But you know what? I've lived long enough to know...

59:03.420 --> 59:05.480
that not everything goes my way.

Thank you.
