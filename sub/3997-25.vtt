WEBVTT

00:01.625 --> 00:03.150
Hey, guys! Hurry up!

00:03.169 --> 00:04.865
I'm the maid of honor and
I have to be there early

00:04.884 --> 00:06.661
and I wanna get a
picture in before we go.

00:06.678 --> 00:10.222
<i>Miami Vice</i> called and I'm not sure...
I don't know how to finish that joke.

00:10.240 --> 00:12.153
- What?
- Ah, it's a crap joke, scratch it.

00:12.189 --> 00:14.395
Winston, please. Your
belly is on my hip.

00:14.414 --> 00:16.764
- Dad, can you come and take our picture?
- All right.

00:16.781 --> 00:20.442
Having a little trouble getting
off this air mattress.

00:20.477 --> 00:22.333
Oh, here we go.

00:22.386 --> 00:24.392
And we... okay.
I'm off, I'm off.

00:24.412 --> 00:26.406
Here... where is it? All
right, give me this.

00:26.436 --> 00:27.676
Let's do this.

00:27.705 --> 00:29.243
Okay, you ready?

00:29.249 --> 00:31.418
Scrunch together. There we go.

00:31.437 --> 00:33.012
No...

00:33.086 --> 00:35.605
- uh, Rick, move one step to your right.
- Me?

00:35.611 --> 00:37.743
Yes, one step to your right.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.412
One more step to your right.

00:39.424 --> 00:41.900
- I can't go much further.
- One more step to your right.

00:41.919 --> 00:43.917
Until you get into the hallway,

00:43.929 --> 00:46.850
- and then, once you get in the hallway...
- No, I see what you're doing, dude. - Dad,

00:46.863 --> 00:49.876
- Very funny, buddy. - Dad, Dad, we have to go...
- ...go directly to the Chinatown trash can

00:49.894 --> 00:52.434
- where you got that suit. - There's nothing wrong
with this suit. - Dad, we need to take the picture.

00:52.453 --> 00:53.892
I wore this at my
high school graduation.

00:53.911 --> 00:57.254
- Nick, you're not doing yourself any favors.
- I look very handsome. I look like I'm on <i>Miami Vice.</i>

00:57.272 --> 00:58.885
- Should I take the picture?
- No, I'm not doing this.

00:58.903 --> 01:01.549
- He's getting on me about the suit.
- You're ruining the picture.   - Okay.

01:01.574 --> 01:02.974
- I'm not doing it. I'm out of here.

01:02.986 --> 01:05.799
- Stop. Where are you going?
- Was gonna do my cool poses.

01:05.830 --> 01:08.271
You ready? One, two...

01:08.772 --> 01:11.492

01:19.435 --> 01:21.160
- You changed.
- Check it out.

01:21.178 --> 01:22.634
Schmidt gave me his worst suit.

01:22.640 --> 01:25.568
He said, if I could get it over
my thighs, he didn't want it.

01:25.574 --> 01:28.574
<i>Miami Vice</i> called, and
this time, I answered.

01:28.592 --> 01:30.747
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

01:31.230 --> 01:33.974
I hope you're not doing all this
'cause of what my dad said.

01:33.992 --> 01:36.794
I don't think you're an
unemployable alcoholic bummer.

01:36.813 --> 01:38.642
- What?
- No, I don't think you're a child.

01:38.660 --> 01:41.687
- Whoa, when did he say that?
- Hmm?

01:42.094 --> 01:43.401
- What?
- Bob said that about me?

01:43.414 --> 01:44.813
Anyway, the point is...

01:44.832 --> 01:46.950
I don't think you're
any of those things.

01:47.074 --> 01:49.256
We're at a wedding together.

01:49.304 --> 01:50.948
It's nice, right?
You look great.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.743
Thanks. So do you.

01:52.792 --> 01:55.098
- I'm gonna go find Cece.
- Yeah.

01:55.705 --> 01:58.618
All right, I guess
we're doing that.

02:00.749 --> 02:04.080
There are so many fun,
cool traditions at this thing.

02:04.098 --> 02:06.089
The groom comes in
on a white horse.

02:06.102 --> 02:09.451
So, basically, they're just
copying my Bar Mitzvah.

02:10.151 --> 02:11.545
Oh, my goodness.

02:11.807 --> 02:14.557
That is Bucky the Badger,
Wisconsin's mascot.

02:14.594 --> 02:16.427
Yeah, I got a sweatshirt
with his face on it,

02:16.462 --> 02:18.580
and he's wearing a sweatshirt
with his face on it.

02:18.737 --> 02:21.192
Bucky cool. Bucky!

02:21.256 --> 02:22.950
He's got a super weird
thing with badgers.

02:22.975 --> 02:24.637
Is that a real badger?

02:24.822 --> 02:27.598
Hey, the ceremony lasts
for three hours,

02:27.610 --> 02:30.675
so you better go pee now.
You know, your weak bladder.

02:30.688 --> 02:32.444
- You remembered.
- Of course I did.

02:32.462 --> 02:35.269
Now I have to pee. Every time
you say "pee," I have to pee.

02:36.315 --> 02:38.267
Thank you for coming.

02:40.761 --> 02:43.291
- Go pee. Okay.
- I'm gonna.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.290
It's okay to be nervous.

02:45.336 --> 02:46.898
But nothing can go wrong.

02:46.917 --> 02:50.084
All you have to do
is go out there,

02:50.387 --> 02:54.292
get married, and I will
do the rest, okay?

02:54.784 --> 02:56.868
Schmidt!

03:01.966 --> 03:03.481
Get out.

03:03.627 --> 03:05.253
Well, this certainly
isn't the bathroom.

03:05.281 --> 03:07.466
Get out. Get out.

03:11.887 --> 03:14.605
Guys, guys, shut up
and listen to me-- it's Cece.

03:14.650 --> 03:16.638
- She doesn't want to get married.
- Damn.    - What happened?

03:16.663 --> 03:18.568
Well, her exact words were: "I
don't want to marry Shivrang,

03:18.580 --> 03:21.780
"but my whole family has flown out here
from all the way across the world.

03:21.798 --> 03:25.795
I can't back out now. Please, Schmidt,
as my closest friend, help me."

03:25.820 --> 03:27.571
- What did Jess say?
- Well, Jess didn't hear it--

03:27.577 --> 03:28.801
Cece told me with her eyes.

03:28.814 --> 03:31.483
- Oh, so nothing happened.  - Cool, so she's
marrying Shivrang.   - No, guys, I know Cece--

03:31.501 --> 03:33.701
- I know her looks.
- Schmidt, what were you doing back there?

03:33.719 --> 03:34.988
Cece's backing out
of the wedding.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.444
- What?
- It's true. She told me.

03:36.469 --> 03:38.313
- With her eyes.
- Oh, my God.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.510
I thought you were talking
about something real. Schmidt.

03:40.527 --> 03:42.173
The wedding's
happening-- let her go.

03:42.198 --> 03:45.245
I have let her go. I'm with
Elizabeth now and she's amazing.

03:45.257 --> 03:48.426
Look, Jess, I'm telling you this
as Cece's friend and nothing more.

03:48.439 --> 03:50.170
Cece loves Shivrang--
I know that

03:50.195 --> 03:51.800
'cause I know her
better than you do.

03:51.818 --> 03:54.276
False. When you've had
sexual congress with someone

03:54.281 --> 03:57.226
and you've peered into their soul at
the exact moment of fulfillment...

03:57.239 --> 03:58.770
- Ew.
- No, no, hear him out.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.920
Schmidt, listen up
and listen good.

04:00.957 --> 04:03.576
You are not to talk to Cece,
you are not to look at Cece,

04:03.600 --> 04:06.729
and you are not to have
eye conversations with her.

04:06.740 --> 04:08.770
Or I will bust you.

04:08.847 --> 04:10.514
Hard.

04:10.544 --> 04:12.760
- And later, I'm gonna bust you hard.
- Yeah, you are.

04:12.878 --> 04:16.072
Good night, nurse.
I've been naughty.

04:16.300 --> 04:17.769
Sorry, I didn't know--
you guys were supposed...

04:17.786 --> 04:19.081
not supposed to hear that, so...

04:19.106 --> 04:21.481
Bros ever before the ho.

04:21.505 --> 04:23.275
- Anybody have a jar?
- I'm sorry, okay?

04:23.300 --> 04:25.752
But we have to
sabotage this wedding.

04:25.769 --> 04:27.388
- Winston?
- No, guys, look,

04:27.400 --> 04:30.031
you always bring me into
these situations, and

04:30.063 --> 04:33.970
I get in over my head
because I love pranks.

04:34.165 --> 04:35.784
I really do.
I mean, you know that.

04:35.796 --> 04:39.284
- Yeah.   - But look, it's time
for me to just face the facts

04:39.313 --> 04:41.488
that I'm no good at them.

04:41.561 --> 04:45.153
You know, I'm 31 now, and it's
time for me to cut the nonsense.

04:45.203 --> 04:47.680
You're 100% right, man,
but just, I don't know...

04:47.730 --> 04:50.106
what about today, just today...

04:50.322 --> 04:52.542
you give me full-on crazy?

04:53.124 --> 04:54.568
- Yeah!
- You listen here!

04:54.606 --> 04:57.137
- Hey, hey, hey. Nobody's doing anything!
- Yeah!     - What?

04:57.168 --> 04:59.499
- What?
- Jess asked us not to,

04:59.519 --> 05:03.330
so we are going to enjoy
Cece's wedding like adults.

05:03.367 --> 05:05.846
So good night, nurse.

05:05.958 --> 05:07.859
Sorry for saying that.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.063
I am all...

05:09.094 --> 05:11.202
I'm all turned around.

05:11.401 --> 05:14.039
- We sabotaging this thing or what?
- Absolutely.

05:19.354 --> 05:21.355
Hello, Auntie.

05:21.690 --> 05:23.996
This is embarrassing.

05:27.045 --> 05:29.046
I'll be right back.

05:31.542 --> 05:33.205
Excuse me, Elizabeth.
Can I talk business?

05:33.230 --> 05:34.789
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

05:34.808 --> 05:36.824
- I want you to call it off.
- What?

05:36.848 --> 05:39.891
Whatever you're planning
on doing, don't do it.

05:39.916 --> 05:42.829
- This wedding means a lot to Jess.
- What are you doing?

05:43.390 --> 05:44.602
What has happened to you?

05:44.620 --> 05:46.744
- You changed your suit, you're carrying
her purse.        - Yeah, I am.

05:46.768 --> 05:48.235
You're wearing deodorant

05:48.267 --> 05:49.797
- under both arms...
- Both arms, yeah.

05:49.812 --> 05:53.875
Why are you trying so hard, man?
Either Jess wants the real you or...

05:53.999 --> 05:55.825
or she don't.

05:55.898 --> 05:57.966
The real Nick would help
me sabo this wedding.

05:58.019 --> 06:00.607
Is "sabo" short
for sabotage, Schmidt?

06:00.644 --> 06:01.894
Why would you...?

06:01.919 --> 06:04.033
- I mean, why would you even say that?
- I knew it was. I was being mean.

06:04.050 --> 06:06.893
- I was bullying you to get dominance in this moment.
- You know it... of course you know... you know it is.

06:06.923 --> 06:08.191
- I want you to call it off.
- You know it's...

06:08.211 --> 06:12.531
- You know "sabo" is short for sabot... sabotage.
- I know... I know... Hey, skin it and call it off.

06:12.554 --> 06:14.707
- You got it, man.
- Thanks, man.

06:14.744 --> 06:17.217
- I'll call it off. No problem, Nicholas.
- Thank you, buddy. I appreciate that.

06:17.248 --> 06:18.423
- Thank you.
- Now.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.078
Now?

06:24.899 --> 06:26.347
Shivrang, hold on!

06:26.365 --> 06:28.050
Ow, my testicles!

06:28.071 --> 06:29.890
Don't get on the highway!

06:29.921 --> 06:33.059
Just reared up and
just took off...

06:33.167 --> 06:36.477
- I'm scared that it might have damaged me.
- No, no, no, no damage.

06:36.508 --> 06:39.693
Are you enjoying the wedding
festivities, Schmidt?

06:40.147 --> 06:43.000
What a spunky horse.

06:43.402 --> 06:46.615
I know you're responsible
for the horse thing.

06:46.634 --> 06:48.321
- Was I?
- Yes.

06:48.383 --> 06:49.805
- Was I?
- Yes.

06:49.845 --> 06:51.996
- Was...?
- Yes.

06:57.038 --> 06:59.022
- Was...?
- Yes.

06:59.147 --> 07:01.181

Aah!

- It's so freaking catchy.

- Because it's exactly

08:31.130 --> 08:32.931
the type of thing that you do.

08:32.955 --> 08:36.878
- A stupid, childish prank.
- Oh, childish?

08:38.509 --> 08:39.979
You're right.

08:40.004 --> 08:41.655
I'm a child.

08:43.784 --> 08:45.964
- Great sabo, man!
- I'm so good at pranks, man.

08:45.983 --> 08:48.336

09:10.582 --> 09:12.386
- Uh, hey, Jess?
- Hmm?

09:12.436 --> 09:14.180
- We went too far.
- What?

09:14.343 --> 09:16.212
- It's bad.
- How bad?

09:16.355 --> 09:18.319
It's really bad.

09:22.683 --> 09:23.945
Schmidt...

09:23.992 --> 09:26.063
- What did you do?
- It was Winston's idea.

09:26.082 --> 09:27.257
Oh, my God.

09:27.281 --> 09:30.492
I'm really sorry, okay? I didn't want
anybody to get hurt, but it's too late now.

09:30.527 --> 09:32.827
- It's bigger than all of us.
- Tell me everything.

09:32.846 --> 09:35.345
Or, so help me God,
I will mess up your hair.

09:35.364 --> 09:37.110
Your precious hair.

09:37.408 --> 09:39.933
- Winston's in the...
- What?

09:39.977 --> 09:43.057
- Winston's in...
- What? Say it louder. Say it louder.

09:43.069 --> 09:46.096
Winston is in the air
ducts with a badger.

09:46.217 --> 09:48.198
- What?!
- Nick's there, too.

09:48.231 --> 09:49.637
Ah, Nick.

09:49.655 --> 09:51.884
You've never gone along
with one of my pranks before.

09:51.917 --> 09:54.048
This is exciting.

09:54.073 --> 09:57.254
I never noticed, but you kind of
have a girl butt. Is that weird to say?

09:57.273 --> 09:59.109
This priest is never
gonna know what hit him.

09:59.138 --> 10:00.896
Wait, that is the plan?

10:01.001 --> 10:03.244
You're gonna drop a badger
on a priest?

10:03.256 --> 10:05.446
Oh! He's mad.

10:05.464 --> 10:07.163
That can't be the plan, man!

10:07.196 --> 10:10.684
- What did you do? What did you do? What did you do?
- I deserve this. I deserve this. I deserve this, okay?

10:10.703 --> 10:13.059
It's just, when Nick
got involved, it became too big.

10:13.081 --> 10:15.070
What? What do you mean,
"when Nick got involved"?

10:15.101 --> 10:17.129
- He wasn't always involved?
- No. He said no.

10:17.166 --> 10:20.041
He said, "Jess means too much to
me," or some crapola like that.

10:20.066 --> 10:21.604
- What are you doing?
- Calling Nick.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.400
Jess, he's in the ducts!

10:23.422 --> 10:24.672
The ducts!

10:24.701 --> 10:27.145
- Beautiful ceremony.
- Happy day.

10:28.264 --> 10:30.458
- The ducts!
- I know where he is, Schmidt.

10:32.736 --> 10:34.796
- What? No, no.
- That's my phone.

10:34.822 --> 10:36.788
- I said no phones.
- I know. I'm gonna get it.

10:36.806 --> 10:38.138
They can track us with phones.

10:38.156 --> 10:40.369
What is going...? Relax.
You're so weird with pranks.

10:40.382 --> 10:41.814
- What is going on with you?
- Put the phone away!

10:41.845 --> 10:44.540
I'm trying to! I'm trying
to turn it off, you idiot!

10:44.564 --> 10:46.915
Oh... no.

10:46.972 --> 10:48.172
- What's going on?
- Uh...

10:48.184 --> 10:49.722
Bucky got out of his cage, man.

10:49.743 --> 10:52.414
- No! No! I'm getting out of here!
- Let's go get him. No, you're coming with me.

10:52.439 --> 10:54.782
You got to help me find the badger, Nick!

10:54.811 --> 10:57.499
- You don't be no bitch!
- I want out of this place!

10:57.524 --> 10:58.724
 Bucky!

10:58.773 --> 11:00.294
God bless both of you.

11:00.319 --> 11:02.854
May he shower you
with many, many children.

11:04.270 --> 11:05.439
Ugh, he's not picking up.

11:05.463 --> 11:07.657
- Of course he's not picking up.
He's in the...      - Don't say it.

11:07.682 --> 11:09.295
...ducts.

11:09.648 --> 11:10.852
He's in the ducts.

11:10.870 --> 11:14.108
Nick, stop being a bitch!
Don't be no bitch!

11:14.126 --> 11:14.939
Bucky!

11:14.952 --> 11:16.083
- I'm going up there.
- Okay, good.

11:16.108 --> 11:17.614
'Cause I really don't want
to go up there. Look,

11:17.634 --> 11:20.645
I'm the kind of guy that likes to enjoy
the AC, not see how the sausage is made.

11:20.663 --> 11:23.140
Seriously, Schmidt?
Shut up and give me a boost.

11:25.048 --> 11:26.251
Bucky...

11:26.500 --> 11:27.990
Aah.

11:29.618 --> 11:31.843
- Winston!
- Nick, where are you?

11:31.861 --> 11:33.342
- Marco...
- Polo!

11:33.368 --> 11:34.856
I don't want to play that.

11:35.287 --> 11:37.393
- No!
- Nick, it's me!

11:37.449 --> 11:38.995
Nick, it's me!

11:39.020 --> 11:40.828
Jess, what are you doing here?

11:40.859 --> 11:43.175
Look, I-I know you didn't
plan the sabotage,

11:43.198 --> 11:46.050
and I know you're doing this just to get
back at me, but please don't do this.

11:46.068 --> 11:49.152
Jess, it's not about
the sabotage, okay?

11:49.209 --> 11:52.351
It's about the fact that you think I'm
gonna screw up everything I touch.

11:52.370 --> 11:53.851
- No, Nick, I don't.
- You know what, Jess?

11:53.876 --> 11:56.298
This is where I belong.

11:56.540 --> 11:59.465
With Winston and a badger.

11:59.484 --> 12:02.620
All right, Nick, look, let's just go
get the badger and get out of here.

12:02.633 --> 12:04.784
Can't get the badger
because it's loose.

12:04.840 --> 12:05.709
What?!

12:05.727 --> 12:08.170
Hey, Jess, welcome, welcome.

12:08.182 --> 12:09.395
No! Jess!

12:09.413 --> 12:11.976
You know, I'm just staying
positive, but, uh...

12:11.995 --> 12:14.601
- I'm pretty sure this is where we die.
- Winston!

12:14.628 --> 12:17.181
When you complete
the seven circles,

12:17.230 --> 12:19.380
you will be officially married.

12:19.414 --> 12:21.665
You don't have to walk
so fast, you know.

12:28.685 --> 12:30.335
Guys?

12:30.788 --> 12:32.213
Guys, you know...

12:32.232 --> 12:34.818
I've been thinking
a lot about the Earth.

12:34.961 --> 12:37.288
We got to leave it better
than when we found it.

12:37.307 --> 12:39.737
Is this what you wanted
your life to be?

12:39.755 --> 12:42.687
Is this how you wanted to enjoy
your best friend's wedding?

12:42.712 --> 12:44.769
Nick, look, no.
Stop that.

12:44.793 --> 12:47.943
- I am not a healthy person.
- Yeah, I know. I know, Nick.

12:47.961 --> 12:49.280
Oh, you do?

12:49.298 --> 12:51.479
- So a part of you agrees with your dad.
- No.

12:51.504 --> 12:54.213
- Just... oh, my...
- Okay. We got to get out of here.

12:54.231 --> 12:58.006
...lovely ceremony with
all your family and friends.

12:58.226 --> 13:00.428
Tell me that there isn't
a small part of you

13:00.447 --> 13:02.080
that's scared that
I'm too much of a mess.

13:02.106 --> 13:05.175
- We have to go.
- That this thing is a mistake.

13:05.525 --> 13:07.109
You and me.

13:09.039 --> 13:11.575
Just admit it, Jess.

13:12.883 --> 13:14.884
Yes, there is a small part.

13:16.425 --> 13:17.643
Yeah.

13:18.024 --> 13:19.264
But...

13:20.628 --> 13:22.349
Run!

13:27.353 --> 13:28.647
Oh, my...

13:31.401 --> 13:33.420
- It's okay.
- Jess?

13:33.454 --> 13:35.740
Always a bridesmaid...

13:41.511 --> 13:44.348
Aah! Something touched my leg!

13:44.515 --> 13:49.168
You know, sometimes I feel like I
never really felt love, you know?

13:50.003 --> 13:51.870
Do you know?

13:54.545 --> 13:56.299
Hey! Hey, hey, everybody.

13:56.332 --> 13:59.767
Hi. Hi. I'm Jessica Day. I'm
the, uh, maid of honor.

13:59.785 --> 14:02.791
I'm also the person who fell through the
roof with my friend Nick Miller here.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.930
Um, I have a few things to say.

14:05.036 --> 14:08.512
Um, there might be a badger on the
loose, but I have my best people on it.

14:08.537 --> 14:10.256
I'm on it.
Don't scare the badger!

14:10.275 --> 14:11.865
- Schmidty, help me!
- Okay!

14:13.225 --> 14:14.981
- Funnel it into the mandap!
- Okay.

14:15.012 --> 14:16.878
Hey, guys.
He's in the ninth row.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.453
He is headed north.

14:19.189 --> 14:21.835
Where were we? Um, Your Honor,
please tell us where we were.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.998
We were on the seventh circle.

14:24.105 --> 14:25.165
So close.

14:25.177 --> 14:26.471
Great. Cece, go.

14:26.496 --> 14:29.104
- Jess, you don't have to fix this.
- Fix what?

14:29.204 --> 14:32.239
This is a perfect day.

14:38.918 --> 14:42.189
I'm sorry, everyone,
but I can't do this.

14:42.871 --> 14:45.808
And it's not
because of the horse.

14:46.076 --> 14:48.313
Or the badger.

14:48.558 --> 14:50.759
Or "Cotton-Eyed Joe."

14:52.349 --> 14:55.100
This isn't what I want.

14:56.801 --> 14:59.837
What I want is to be
with someone else.

15:03.693 --> 15:05.813
Shivrang, I feel
terrible. I'm sorry.

15:05.832 --> 15:07.126
No...

15:07.151 --> 15:09.526
No, Cece, it is okay.

15:09.940 --> 15:12.392
In fact, it's more than okay.

15:12.410 --> 15:15.495
I don't know why I didn't tell
you the truth ages ago, but...

15:15.525 --> 15:17.442
but I want to be
with someone else, too.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.677
- Really?
- Yes.

15:20.430 --> 15:23.333
I have tried to forget you,
Elaine-- really, I have--

15:23.351 --> 15:25.470
- but I just can't.
- Who the hell is Elaine?

15:25.489 --> 15:27.503
And I don't care
what my family says.

15:27.522 --> 15:30.711
I want to marry you
in a Presbyterian church.

15:32.848 --> 15:34.468
Oh, Shivvy.

15:34.582 --> 15:36.822
I've loved you
since the first grade.

15:36.849 --> 15:40.266
And I'm so lonely without you. I just lay
awake at night, and I just write about you

15:40.284 --> 15:43.010
in my journal, and I paint
pictures of you on my easel.

15:43.028 --> 15:45.202
I want our children to
be photographers and...

15:45.220 --> 15:47.111
and backpack across Europe.

15:47.406 --> 15:49.424
Will you take me away
from this madness?

15:49.442 --> 15:52.532
And you are not too short for me. I
don't care what your mother says.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.371
Oh, Elaine!

15:54.699 --> 15:55.728
Come!

15:55.740 --> 15:57.681
Let's go to Vegas and elope!

16:01.713 --> 16:03.857
I feel slightly rejected.

16:04.276 --> 16:05.601
Well...

16:05.626 --> 16:08.889
- you were slightly rejected.
- Yeah.

16:09.157 --> 16:11.108
You okay?

16:11.484 --> 16:13.833
Well, I'm not as
good as Elaine.

16:13.989 --> 16:15.510
Who could be?

16:16.342 --> 16:18.418
I feel better than I've
felt in a long time.

16:18.442 --> 16:20.687
Good. I'm glad.

16:22.154 --> 16:24.756
Boobies.

16:25.551 --> 16:28.151
I don't think the badger's
actually rabid. I think, um...

16:28.170 --> 16:30.420
he's just kind of a dick. So...

16:32.250 --> 16:34.001
Hey, Nick.

16:34.709 --> 16:36.628
- You okay?
- Me? Yeah.

16:36.659 --> 16:38.119
You mean from the fall?

16:38.147 --> 16:40.378
Yeah. And...

16:40.878 --> 16:44.097
- what we talked about.
- Yeah. Look, Jess, it's not...

16:44.142 --> 16:45.929
you know, that big of a deal.

16:45.958 --> 16:48.092
And we tried.
It's just...

16:50.885 --> 16:53.511
You might be right about your
fears, you know, it's...

16:53.529 --> 16:54.704
Just...

16:54.729 --> 16:56.497
just say it.

16:56.679 --> 16:59.669
I-I think we should
call it, you know?

17:00.133 --> 17:02.450
It's not like we're
in love or anything.

17:03.629 --> 17:05.797
We had one night.

17:10.990 --> 17:13.085
Okay, let's call it.

17:13.131 --> 17:15.830
I think that feels good to me.

17:15.873 --> 17:17.742
Does that feel good to you?

17:26.834 --> 17:28.536
But you must
have feelings for her.

17:28.549 --> 17:30.771
You tried to
sabotage her wedding.

17:30.790 --> 17:33.384
I sabotaged her
wedding as a friend.

17:33.574 --> 17:36.332
I didn't want her to
marry someone else

17:36.357 --> 17:37.847
as a friend.

17:37.938 --> 17:39.613
It's only mantic
because it's a wedding.

17:39.619 --> 17:41.949
I would be just as happy
to sabotage, I don't know...

17:42.002 --> 17:44.352
- let's say, her tax audit.
- Schmidt.

17:44.884 --> 17:46.853
Weird day, huh?

17:47.128 --> 17:48.586
It's a beautiful wedding, Cece.

17:48.657 --> 17:50.291
- Thank you.
- It was Schmidt

17:50.319 --> 17:52.948
that you were
talking about, right?

17:56.290 --> 17:58.134
It was.

17:59.848 --> 18:01.548
I'm-I'm sorry, Elizabeth.

18:01.567 --> 18:04.455
Don't be sorry. It's not your problem.
It's Schmidt's.

18:04.508 --> 18:06.814
- Why is it... Why is it my problem?
- Who's it gonna be?

18:06.832 --> 18:08.904
Me or her?

18:09.238 --> 18:10.963
No, she's right.

18:11.129 --> 18:14.185
- You have to choose.
- We're gonna do this now?

18:14.834 --> 18:18.074
But can... can we sleep on it,
maybe? Maybe take the night?

18:18.288 --> 18:19.301
I've got...

18:19.326 --> 18:22.493
I just got this brand-new Coldplay bootleg.
Live from Rotterdam.

18:22.511 --> 18:24.673
What if we just make some pasta
and really listen to it?

18:24.710 --> 18:27.634
Are you in love with her
or are you in love with me?

18:29.219 --> 18:31.199
You have to decide.

18:39.422 --> 18:40.740
Can I get a beer?

18:40.759 --> 18:42.546
- Heisler?
- Perfect.

19:00.272 --> 19:02.190
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

19:03.178 --> 19:05.045
Bucky bit me.

19:05.165 --> 19:06.821
- Bit me bad.
- Hmm.

19:06.845 --> 19:08.892
Yeah. So, um...

19:09.293 --> 19:11.127
so I'm pretty dizzy.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.869
Okay.

19:14.217 --> 19:16.805
Okay, what happened with Jess?

19:17.347 --> 19:18.860
We called it.

19:18.884 --> 19:20.685
And she left.

19:21.559 --> 19:24.170
Yeah, we-we called it off.

19:24.487 --> 19:28.793
So, now I'm gonna drink,
because that's my move.

19:29.563 --> 19:32.470
Yeah. That was also
your dad's move.

19:34.903 --> 19:38.619
Yeah, when things get
messy, you just run away.

19:40.454 --> 19:43.089
But, you know, there
are other moves.

19:48.685 --> 19:49.968
Go.

19:51.658 --> 19:53.291
Thanks, man.

19:56.248 --> 19:58.813
Hey, bartender, can you
call an ambulance?

19:58.904 --> 20:00.576
I'm about to bleed out.

20:00.595 --> 20:02.357
Thanks, man.

20:08.184 --> 20:11.564
Look, I know you think
we should call it,

20:11.582 --> 20:13.736
