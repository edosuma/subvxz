ADULT ADAM: <i> Nothing feels</i>
<i> more magical</i>
<i> than first love.</i>

00:03.004 --> 00:06.038
<i> As a kid,</i>
<i> you fall so hard</i>
<i> and feel so much,</i>

00:06.040 --> 00:09.008
<i> it makes the first breakup</i>
<i> that much more painful.</i>

00:09.010 --> 00:11.143
<i> It had been months</i>
<i> since Dana and I split,</i>

00:11.145 --> 00:13.779
<i> and I decided it was time</i>
<i> to move on.</i>

00:13.781 --> 00:16.815
<i> Thankfully, my big bro</i>
<i> was there to help.</i>

00:16.817 --> 00:17.683
Dude,
what are you doing?

00:17.685 --> 00:21.153
Feathering my hair like
famed lady killer
Robert Lowe.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.522
No.
Watch and learn.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.261
Now that's what
the ladies like.

00:29.263 --> 00:32.131
It looks super wet
but somehow
it's dry and crispy.

00:32.133 --> 00:35.267
ADULT ADAM: <i> Even though</i>
<i> I decided against</i>
<i> the flammable helmet head,</i>

00:35.269 --> 00:37.536
<i> I was starting to feel like</i>
<i> I was back on my game.</i>

00:37.538 --> 00:40.239
<i> And what do you know,</i>
<i> girls were checking me out.</i>

00:40.241 --> 00:42.374
(CHUCKLES) <i> A lot!</i>
<i> Like, too much.</i>

00:42.376 --> 00:46.278
<i> Almost as if they weren't</i>
<i> even looking at me...</i>
<i> Ah, damn it!</i>

00:46.280 --> 00:47.746
Stupid handsome Ben.

00:47.748 --> 00:50.049
Can you walk
somewhere else?

00:50.051 --> 00:50.649
Sure thing, pal.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.751
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Finding a new Dana</i>
<i> was gonna be tough,</i>

00:52.753 --> 00:54.753
<i> so I turned to my sister's</i>
<i> poster gallery</i>

00:54.755 --> 00:57.923
<i> of beloved</i>
<i> '80s heartthrobs</i>
<i> for inspiration.</i>

00:57.925 --> 01:00.526
Such kind eyes.
Is that the trick?

01:00.528 --> 01:03.062
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And then reality hit me.</i>

01:03.064 --> 01:04.730
What are you doing
to my Donnie?

01:04.732 --> 01:06.965
These bros
get all the girls.

01:06.967 --> 01:08.367
Now that Dana and I
broke up,

01:08.369 --> 01:09.835
I've got to learn
their secrets.

01:09.837 --> 01:12.071
Well, for starters,
they don't have
wonky voices,

01:12.073 --> 01:14.073
and they don't cry
at <i> The Muppet Movie.</i>

01:14.075 --> 01:17.009
If <i> Rainbow Connection</i>
doesn't move you to tears,

01:17.011 --> 01:18.677
then you're not alive.

01:18.679 --> 01:19.244
What happened?

01:19.246 --> 01:21.013
(STUTTERS)
It's like I'm totally
invisible to girls.

01:21.015 --> 01:24.116
At this rate,
I'll never get
another Dana.

01:24.118 --> 01:26.285
Dude,
getting girls is easy.

01:26.287 --> 01:27.853
You don't know anything
about girls.

01:27.855 --> 01:28.854
All you need
is a hook,

01:28.856 --> 01:30.589
something that makes you
stand out.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.725
Yeah?
And what's your hook?

01:33.994 --> 01:35.461
Turtlenecks.

01:35.463 --> 01:36.762
Sexy and comfortable.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.263
Still upset
about Dana, huh?

01:38.265 --> 01:40.899
Lucky for you,
I actually know a girl
who's super into you.

01:40.901 --> 01:44.803
Really?
Mom, Adam's
feeling unloved!

01:44.805 --> 01:46.438
Wait, what?

01:46.440 --> 01:46.972
Is my baby sad?

01:46.974 --> 01:50.709
Well, look out,
'cause the cuddle coyote
is stalking you!

01:50.711 --> 01:52.578
Why?
Stay out of my room.

01:52.580 --> 01:55.280
I'm coming for snuggies.

ADULT ADAM:

<i> 1980-something</i>

02:13.801 --> 02:15.000

02:18.906 --> 02:19.304
Hey.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.740
Robin Leach was
about to explain
why I need a wine butler.

02:21.742 --> 02:25.677
Too bad.
You're supposed to be
studying for the PSAT!

02:25.679 --> 02:26.211
And I finished.

02:26.213 --> 02:28.814
I did every practice exam
in the whole book.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.149
Oh, is that right?
Explain this.

02:30.151 --> 02:33.652
The correct answers
just happened to form
the Van Halen logo.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.454

Woof.

02:35.456 --> 02:36.588

02:39.927 --> 02:41.193
Well,
that's actually you.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.061
Well, I'm putting this
on the fridge,

02:43.063 --> 02:43.762
but I'm still enraged.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.899
Let's just
nip this conversation
in the butt.

02:46.901 --> 02:47.733

02:57.611 --> 02:58.110
Wait!

02:58.112 --> 03:01.713
Did you just actually
abandon your chair

03:01.715 --> 03:04.183
Look, you're gonna
prepare for that test.

03:04.185 --> 03:06.351
Your whole damn future
depends on it.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.253
Don't worry
about my future.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.122
Trust me, I have
a million awesome options.

educational stretches

03:36.817 --> 03:38.283

03:38.285 --> 03:40.385
Actually,
I won't waste your time.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.820
I'll just wait here
and make small talk

03:41.822 --> 03:43.722
until my dad circles
around the block

03:43.724 --> 03:45.524
to make sure
I didn't bail.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.858
After that, I'm out.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.894

Bup-bup!

<i> like Dana.</i>

04:01.108 --> 04:01.673
Poor kid.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.976
He's been a wreck
since he broke up
with Dana.

04:03.978 --> 04:06.278
I know. It breaks my heart
to see him like this.

04:06.280 --> 04:09.748
Past two years,
all he's cared
about is a girl.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.850
But now I've got
my snuggle muffin back.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.086
Yeah, you really sound
torn up about it.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.787
I'm just saying
it'll be nice

04:15.789 --> 04:18.957
to finally spend some time
with him again.

Levitating over
the Grand Canyon

04:45.286 --> 04:47.119

is just plain crazy.

04:47.121 --> 04:50.389
There is no magic

Love is dead.

It's not worth it!

05:00.467 --> 05:03.435
Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Copperfield
must be beside themselves!

05:03.437 --> 05:05.671
You do know that walking
through a solid wall

05:05.673 --> 05:09.074
of ancient Chinese rocks
is humanly...

05:09.076 --> 05:09.574
Oh, balls!

05:09.576 --> 05:14.246
Oh, you gave us
quite a scare,

06:19.046 --> 06:21.780

a new picture for your ad.

I just found my new Dana.

06:31.458 --> 06:32.791

it'll be a problem

06:32.793 --> 06:34.926

I've been waiting
a freakin' hour!

06:43.003 --> 06:44.169
Why are you sitting
in that thing?

06:44.171 --> 06:45.370
'Cause I stole it
from the food mart

06:45.372 --> 06:48.039
so we could take turns
smashing it into
the Dumpsters. Duh.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.442
Sorry, bro.
PSAT study group ran late.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.511
PSAT study group?
For what?

06:52.513 --> 06:54.746
Um, to, like,
get into college
and get jobs and stuff.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.115
What are you talking about?
You're Madman Schwartz.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.752
You're gonna be
a successful WWF villain
hated by millions.

07:00.754 --> 07:01.953
Naturally,
but as a fallback,

07:01.955 --> 07:04.423
I'll probably be
an ophthalmologist
like my dad,

07:04.425 --> 07:05.891
Eyeman Schwartz.
What?

07:05.893 --> 07:07.926
Cogan, talk some sense
into this lunatic.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.561
Actually, I'm the one
that gave him the idea.

07:09.563 --> 07:12.130
I'm thinking about
doing premed.
That's not the dream.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.065
You're gonna be
a female body inspector.

07:14.067 --> 07:17.702
Turns out,
that's not a real job,
just a hilarious t-shirt.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.371
Okay, Naked Rob,
my rock.

07:19.373 --> 07:22.607
Please tell me you're still
gonna be a steel drummer
on a clothing-optional beach.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.777
Well, I was thinking
about getting my degree
in musical engineering.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.179
It'll require clothes,
but at some point,

07:27.181 --> 07:28.847
a boy's got
to become a man.

07:28.849 --> 07:29.981
What the hell happened
to all our plans?

07:29.983 --> 07:32.017
You're making me feel like
all this time
in the parking lot

07:32.019 --> 07:33.318
smashing stuff
was a complete
waste of time!

07:33.320 --> 07:38.190
Bar, all our plans
were just big dreams.
College is real life.

07:38.192 --> 07:39.891
Real life is for sellouts.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.460
I will never give up
my dreams.

07:41.462 --> 07:44.262
My dreams are what
give me my dignity.

07:44.264 --> 07:45.230
Dignity, I say!

07:45.232 --> 07:46.298
Good day to you,
gentlemen!

07:54.975 --> 07:58.376

07:58.378 --> 08:01.546
Can't I just get you
something like this?

08:02.483 --> 08:04.449
I think these are aces.

08:04.451 --> 08:07.652
Come on. I need
Copperfield-level stuff.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.489
I get the appeal
of Davey C.

08:10.491 --> 08:11.656
(CHUCKLES) I do.

08:11.658 --> 08:12.591
But this is too much.

08:12.593 --> 08:15.360
ADULT ADAM: <i> It was clear</i>
<i> if I wanted her</i>
<i> to fund my act,</i>

08:15.362 --> 08:17.629
<i> I'd have to do</i>
<i> some acting</i>
<i> of my own.</i>

08:17.631 --> 08:22.634
I just figured
magic could be fun
for both of us.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.236
What exactly
are you saying?

08:24.238 --> 08:26.471
You know,
something we could
share together.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.273
I mean,
there's no Dana.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.075
Might as well hang out
with my next best lady.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.776
Okay, don't (BLEEP)
with me here.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.112
Are you talking
about mom time?

08:34.114 --> 08:35.046
Yeah, sure.
Say it.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.148
Whatever.
Say the words.
Say "mom time."

08:37.150 --> 08:38.783
Do we have
to call it that?

08:38.785 --> 08:39.651
Yeah.
Mom time.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.920
(EXCLAIMS)
So, can I get
the good tricks?

08:41.922 --> 08:43.388
Well, I guess
every good magician

08:43.390 --> 08:45.824
needs a beautiful assistant
they can saw in half.

08:45.826 --> 08:48.059
Or a hands-off producer
who waits in the wings.

08:48.061 --> 08:48.994
This is gonna be
so much fun!

08:48.996 --> 08:52.397
You can be the
Amazing Adam, and I'll be
the Amazing Beverly!

08:52.399 --> 08:54.699
We can't both be amazing.
Gah!

08:54.701 --> 08:56.067
Hey! Does somebody
work here?

08:56.069 --> 08:59.604
We need all your
best tricks for mom time!

09:00.674 --> 09:01.907
Oh. Okay.

09:01.909 --> 09:05.944
Also, uh, somebody
set the birds free.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.847
Oh, boy.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.350
ADULT ADAM: <i> After getting</i>
<i> the best tricks in the shop,</i>

09:12.352 --> 09:14.185
<i> I picked up</i>
<i> magic really quick.</i>

09:14.187 --> 09:15.987
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> I also picked up</i>

09:15.989 --> 09:18.256
<i> a focus-stealing</i>
<i> smother sidekick.</i>

09:18.258 --> 09:21.459
The Amazing Schmoopie,
everybody.

09:23.864 --> 09:26.131
No wires.
(CHUCKLES)

09:26.466 --> 09:28.700
(COUGHING)
Oh! Honey.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.368
(GASPS) Aah!

09:30.504 --> 09:31.002
Oh!

09:31.004 --> 09:32.470
Gimme, gimme,
gimme, gimme, gimme.

09:32.472 --> 09:33.772
Just an ordinary bottle
of ketchup

09:33.774 --> 09:38.643
that I bought
at the supermarket
and not at the magic shop.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.215
Ta-da!

09:46.320 --> 09:47.218
And for my next trick,

09:47.220 --> 09:51.022
I'm gonna make
a plate of cookies
appear from scratch.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.824
(ALL CHUCKLE)

09:53.894 --> 09:55.160
Well, uh,
what do you think?

09:55.162 --> 09:57.762
Your act is
actually decent.

09:57.764 --> 09:58.163
Yes!

09:58.165 --> 10:00.999
And every second of it
is ruined by your mom.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.305
Hey, Mama, can we talk?

10:07.307 --> 10:09.374
We illusionists
don't need to talk.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.576
We just use ESP.
(CHUCKLES)

10:11.578 --> 10:14.512
You know,
extra-schmoopery-perception.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.348
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
Good stuff.

10:16.350 --> 10:19.417
You can't be my assistant
for the party.

10:19.486 --> 10:20.185
Say what now?

10:20.187 --> 10:23.221
Turns out doing a magic act
with your mother
is super weird.

10:23.223 --> 10:26.291
Well, it's no weirder
than if we were
tennis partners

10:26.293 --> 10:28.059
or joined a dance
competition together.

10:28.061 --> 10:31.596
Truth is, the reason
why I did this
is to impress a girl.

10:31.598 --> 10:35.367
But you just broke up
with a girl.
What about mom time?

10:35.369 --> 10:38.069
Honestly, I kind of played
that part of it up

10:38.071 --> 10:39.337
so you'd buy me
fancy tricks.

10:39.339 --> 10:43.642
I guess all we can
do now is move on.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.111
Yeah, I don't think so.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.279
I'm returning all
your fancy tricks.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.615
What? No!
I looked at store policy.

10:50.617 --> 10:52.817
Once the magic is unleashed,
there's no returns.

10:52.819 --> 10:56.388
You think a return policy
has ever stopped me?

10:56.390 --> 10:57.222
(LAUGHS)

10:57.224 --> 10:58.556
Then go and return
the magic.

10:58.558 --> 11:02.027
I'll come up with my own
David Copperfield
grand illusion!

11:02.029 --> 11:05.030
Fine! Well, enjoy
your mom time...

11:05.032 --> 11:06.831
Without your mom.

11:06.833 --> 11:11.036
ADULT ADAM: <i> Yep, my mom didn't</i>
<i> take being left behind well.</i>

11:11.038 --> 11:12.504
<i> And neither did Barry.</i>

11:12.506 --> 11:13.438
It's crazy.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.806
I mean, my entire posse

11:14.808 --> 11:17.075
is suddenly all about
going to college?

11:17.077 --> 11:18.677
What's wrong with them?

11:18.679 --> 11:19.110
Chill.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.445
They're just studying
a few vocab words.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.280
I'm sure your best
friends will still
end up nobody losers.

11:22.282 --> 11:26.518
That's very nice
of you to say,
but they seem real serious.

11:26.520 --> 11:27.252
Has it ever occurred to you

11:27.254 --> 11:29.387
that perhaps you should
get serious, too?

11:29.389 --> 11:30.088
Barry's right.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.424
Who says we have to, like,
plan out our entire lives?

11:32.426 --> 11:33.425
We're just kids, man.

11:33.427 --> 11:34.793
Exactly.
The future's now.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.562
Can't just let
some stupid test
define who we are.

11:37.564 --> 11:40.298
That's why I didn't even
open up my test results

11:40.300 --> 11:41.166
and see how I did.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.333
That's how little I care.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.269
Wait.
You took the SAT?

11:44.271 --> 11:46.538
But you always said
that test was a joke.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.373
Oh, it is.
But you got to take it.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.908
Give me that!

11:51.812 --> 11:53.545
Oh, no! 1,280?

11:53.547 --> 11:55.213
(SCREAMS)
Lainey, that's unreal!

11:55.215 --> 11:57.315
I did it!
Why is this
happening to me?

11:57.317 --> 11:59.250
Oh, sweetie, I swear this
doesn't change anything.

11:59.252 --> 12:02.587
So you're still gonna be
a background dancer
on Club MTV?

12:02.589 --> 12:03.121
Oh, hell no.

12:03.123 --> 12:06.124
You beginning
your bright future is
a complete betrayal,

12:06.126 --> 12:06.758
but you know what?

12:06.760 --> 12:08.259
It doesn't matter,
'cause I'm still gonna be

12:08.261 --> 12:10.528
a rapping-basketball-
ninja-rapping entrepreneur.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.831
And I totally believe
in you, sweetie.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.566
But yeah, maybe you
should study for the test.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.535
Traitor!
You beautiful, smart traitor!

12:17.537 --> 12:21.139
ADULT ADAM:
<i> While Barry couldn't</i>
<i> believe Lainey's betrayal,</i>

12:21.141 --> 12:22.373
<i> I was ready to believe</i>
<i> in the impossible.</i>

12:22.375 --> 12:25.877
Hey, kiddo,
how's the magic
treating you?

12:25.879 --> 12:28.947
Ah, Pops, good.
We have so much to discuss.

12:28.949 --> 12:32.984
I pored over every
magic special made
by Master Copperfield,

12:32.986 --> 12:34.719
as he is the standard
against which

12:34.721 --> 12:36.554
all us magicians
judge ourselves.

12:36.556 --> 12:39.924
Uh-huh. Maybe we should
turn the light on.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.159
After staying up
all night,

12:41.161 --> 12:44.496
I finally figured out
how he does it, all of it.

12:44.498 --> 12:48.166
Flying over canyons,
making Lady Liberty vanish,

12:48.168 --> 12:49.734
walking through walls.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.136
Ooh, this sounds juicy.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.037
What is it?
What's the secret?

12:53.039 --> 12:54.005
(WHISPERS) Magic.

12:54.007 --> 12:54.939
No, yeah, I get it.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.776
A real magician
can't reveal his tricks,

12:57.778 --> 12:59.043
but how does he do it?

12:59.045 --> 13:00.345
That's just it.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.714
Real actual magic.

13:02.716 --> 13:03.648
Yeah,
I'm not following you.

13:03.650 --> 13:07.051
There's no way a human being
could actually accomplish

13:07.053 --> 13:08.853
what this man could do.

13:08.855 --> 13:10.121
Unless it's real.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.689
Still not following you.

13:11.691 --> 13:12.991
Follow this!

13:12.993 --> 13:14.425
Magic is real.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.628
You should probably
get some sleep.

13:16.630 --> 13:17.162
No time!

13:17.164 --> 13:19.931
I've realized the key
to legitimate sorcery

13:19.933 --> 13:20.732
is to believe.

13:20.734 --> 13:22.867
If you truly have the magic
in your heart,

13:22.869 --> 13:24.869
you can walk
through any wall.

13:24.871 --> 13:25.570
I don't think you can.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.405
I shall traverse
through solid matter

13:27.407 --> 13:31.176
and appear on the other side
of this wall.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.544
Behold!

13:32.546 --> 13:34.779
(THUD)
Oh, my God!

13:34.781 --> 13:36.514
Oh, no!

13:36.516 --> 13:37.182
Magic isn't real!

13:37.184 --> 13:38.783
That's what I'm trying
to tell ya!

13:38.785 --> 13:40.785
You're right.
I can bounce back.

13:40.787 --> 13:43.087
I just have to put together
a new magic act

13:43.089 --> 13:45.356
that'll entertain
a bunch of kids.

13:45.358 --> 13:46.758
Easy.
Peasy.

13:46.760 --> 13:47.992
You're a smart kid.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.628
You'll pull it off
for sure.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.163
You can't let him go through
with this.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.966
He'll make a fool of himself
in front of new Dana.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.769
Well, he should've thought
of that before he lied to me

13:57.771 --> 13:59.737
about mom time
and broke my heart.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.039
The kid is boned, Bevy.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.308
He's literally walking
into walls.

14:03.310 --> 14:04.742
(THUD)
Ow! Damn it!

14:04.744 --> 14:06.344
How does the gorgeous
warlock do it?

14:06.346 --> 14:09.948
ADULT ADAM: <i> While my mom</i>
<i> was realizing the effects</i>
<i> of destroying my show,</i>

14:09.950 --> 14:11.950
<i> Barry was about to put on</i>
<i> a show of his own.</i>

14:11.952 --> 14:13.318
Greetings,
and thank you for coming.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.554
You may have wondered why I
gathered you all here today.

14:16.556 --> 14:17.989
Yes, I was wondering.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.958
See, I was sitting here
watching <i> MacGyver,</i>

14:19.960 --> 14:22.126
and you assembled
these morons
around me.

14:22.128 --> 14:24.896
First, I'd like you all
to know that you're
all the dearest

14:24.898 --> 14:27.498
and most important people
in my life.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.033
And everything about you
disgusts me

14:29.035 --> 14:30.535
'cause you're all
human garbage.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.970
Appreciate the honesty.
Can we go?

14:31.972 --> 14:34.239
No. You may have given up
your dreams

14:34.241 --> 14:36.341
to become cogs in the machine.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.475
But not me.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.109
We discussed this.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.378
You're studying and going
to a good school.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.480
Look, I speak for all
of the JTP...

14:42.482 --> 14:43.147
JTP.
JTP.

14:43.149 --> 14:45.183
...when I say that
being a freelance
ninja for hire

14:45.185 --> 14:45.717
is a big reach.

14:45.719 --> 14:46.818
I mean, you could study
with us if you want.

14:46.820 --> 14:48.987
Never!
Forget ninja.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.388
I'm getting real here.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.358
Talking about
my most sensible dream.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.626
Billionaire entrepreneur!

14:54.628 --> 14:55.894
You do realize
that entrepreneurs

14:55.896 --> 14:59.464
have actual business ideas
and billionaires
have billions?

14:59.466 --> 15:01.399
Oh, I do and I will,

15:01.401 --> 15:02.300
as soon as I present the world

15:02.302 --> 15:05.169
with any one of these awesome
entrepreneurical ideas.

15:05.171 --> 15:07.906
First up,
the reverse microwave.

15:07.908 --> 15:10.008
Makes things colder!

15:10.010 --> 15:11.142
So, a refrigerator?

15:11.144 --> 15:14.245
Next!
Know about
fingerless gloves?

15:14.247 --> 15:16.581
How about just fingers?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.449
I call it Just Fingers.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.084
Did you cut up my Isotoners?

15:20.086 --> 15:21.486
Next, the front pack.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.554
That's just a backpack
you're wearing wrong.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.657
Next!
A house for birds.

15:25.659 --> 15:27.859
Um, that kind of
already exists.

15:27.861 --> 15:28.526
Not like this.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.528
Mine's for the upscale bird.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.964
Okay, I'm shutting it down.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.132
Everyone go home.

15:34.134 --> 15:34.999
You know what else
got shut down?

15:35.001 --> 15:37.268
Sir Isaac Newton when
he invented the apple.

15:37.270 --> 15:37.969
That's enough!

15:37.971 --> 15:39.504
You're studying for that test.
End of story.

15:39.506 --> 15:43.308
No! I'm not even
gonna take the stupid
PSAT or the real one.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.276
Honey, we discussed this.
Everyone takes that test.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.579
What's the point?
We all know I'm gonna
blow it like I always do.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.415
Barry, you're not gonna...
No, I am!

15:50.417 --> 15:52.483
All I have are dreams
'cause I suck at real life,

15:52.485 --> 15:56.154
and I'm supposed to sit here
and watch you leave me behind?

15:56.723 --> 16:00.658
Have fun with your awesome
dreams, without me in them.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.498
ADULT ADAM: <i> It was</i>
<i> the morning of my big show,</i>

16:07.500 --> 16:09.634
<i> and I was hoping</i>
<i> my grand illusion</i>

16:09.636 --> 16:11.235
<i> would impress my new Dana.</i>

16:11.237 --> 16:12.904
Oh, there you are.
