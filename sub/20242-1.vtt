00:59.968 --> 01:03.933
<i>I have sinned against both man and God.</i>

01:05.874 --> 01:09.874
<i>I've spent ten years in a hole
darker than hell...</i>

01:09.978 --> 01:12.964
<i>...waiting, always waiting.</i>

01:13.069 --> 01:14.346
Boyka! Boyka...

01:14.450 --> 01:17.647
<i>I still do not know what this life is for...</i>

01:18.653 --> 01:21.252
<i>...or why it's been given to us.</i>

01:23.151 --> 01:26.319
<i>And I know that a man
that's done what I've done...</i>

01:26.424 --> 01:28.762
<i>...does not deserve to dream.</i>

01:29.873 --> 01:31.425
<i>But I still do.</i>

01:43.140 --> 01:44.567
Come on, Boyka.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.939
Yes! Come on, Boyka!

02:13.096 --> 02:15.022
Get back!

02:16.274 --> 02:17.919
Yeah!

02:20.586 --> 02:22.522
Come on, Boyka!

02:24.632 --> 02:26.212
Yeah!

03:10.256 --> 03:13.629
Koshmar! Koshmar! Koshmar...

04:37.652 --> 04:39.279
Are you ready?

04:39.383 --> 04:41.112
Are you ready?

04:41.216 --> 04:42.829
Fight!

05:52.201 --> 05:55.030
Another generous donation. Thank you.

05:55.134 --> 05:57.064
It is my pleasure.

05:58.938 --> 06:02.934
- Did you win your last fight?
- Yes, Father, I did.

06:03.351 --> 06:04.992
Yuri...

06:05.636 --> 06:10.669
...we are very grateful for all your
donations that helped build this church.

06:12.355 --> 06:16.016
But if it's salvation you seek,
violence is not the answer.

06:17.189 --> 06:20.718
But I told you, it's a sport. We have rules.

06:20.822 --> 06:25.193
Even if you do have rules... do you
think God approves of what you do?

06:25.298 --> 06:27.895
I think God gave me this gift.

06:28.868 --> 06:31.334
And I think it would be a sin to waste it.

06:32.233 --> 06:33.850
Violence...

06:34.171 --> 06:36.538
...has a way of consuming men.

06:37.777 --> 06:40.809
And it is hard to see what good you can do...

06:40.913 --> 06:43.106
...when you're surrounded by that.

06:52.329 --> 06:55.322
Boyka. Boyka. Great news.

06:55.427 --> 06:59.165
I found a fight. A real fight.
The fight that you've wanted.

06:59.269 --> 07:01.898
- The fight that we've waited for.
- Legitimate fight?

07:02.002 --> 07:05.862
Yes. And legal.
Not like this underground shit-hole.

07:05.966 --> 07:07.936
- Where?
- Budapest.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.534
It's a European divisional tournament.

07:10.639 --> 07:14.146
I've convinced the tournament scouts
to come and watch you at your next fight.

07:14.251 --> 07:18.008
If you convince them, then you're in.

07:19.084 --> 07:21.841
- That's it?
- Yes.

07:23.355 --> 07:25.028
Very good.

07:25.132 --> 07:29.024
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
for the main event of the evening...</i>

07:29.128 --> 07:31.222
<i>...a qualification fight...</i>

07:31.326 --> 07:35.655
<i>...sanctioned by the International
Mixed Martial Arts Association.</i>

07:35.760 --> 07:40.997
<i>The winner of this fight will be competing
at the European Championship...</i>

07:41.101 --> 07:43.992
<i>...that will be held in Budapest.</i>

07:44.096 --> 07:45.378
Boyka, the scouts are here...

07:45.482 --> 07:47.601
- ...sitting in the front row.
- Good.

07:47.705 --> 07:49.910
- How are you feeling? Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

07:50.015 --> 07:51.363
- Are you nervous?
- No.

07:51.467 --> 07:55.015
- How is your knee?
- Stop asking so many fucking questions.

07:56.042 --> 07:59.220
Before you go, I must tell you,
I've seen the other fighter.

07:59.324 --> 08:01.656
- He's good.
- They're all good.

08:01.761 --> 08:04.321
- It does not matter.
- This one's different.

08:04.425 --> 08:09.096
He's hungry.
He fights like he needs it. Like you.

08:11.796 --> 08:16.232
Nothing is going to stand in
between me and that tournament.

08:17.322 --> 08:21.639
<i>And now we would like
to welcome to our ring...</i>

08:21.743 --> 08:24.311
<i>...our own local hero...</i>

08:24.416 --> 08:27.678
<i>...our undefeated champion...</i>

08:27.783 --> 08:31.390
<i>...the most complete fighter in the world...</i>

08:31.495 --> 08:35.190
<i>...Yuri Boyka!</i>

08:35.294 --> 08:37.621
<i>Boyka!</i>

08:37.726 --> 08:39.820
<i>Boyka!</i>

08:40.111 --> 08:43.248
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka...

08:44.540 --> 08:46.701
- Hello, Kiril.
- Welcome.

08:46.806 --> 08:49.487
- This is my associate.
- Good to see you again.

08:53.083 --> 08:54.818
Boyka.

08:54.922 --> 08:57.478
All right, gentlemen,
we've been over the rules.

08:57.582 --> 09:00.853
Protect yourselves at all times.
Follow my instructions.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.197
We gotta keep this clean.

09:03.301 --> 09:05.864
Now touch gloves and go to your corners.

09:37.394 --> 09:39.357
This guy's great.

10:16.757 --> 10:18.722
Smart guy.

11:11.516 --> 11:14.262
- You all right?
- No.

11:14.366 --> 11:16.351
You okay? You okay?

11:16.455 --> 11:19.245
Take the mouthpiece. Take the mouthpiece.

11:28.913 --> 11:30.779
Oh, yeah!

11:37.902 --> 11:40.032
Stay the fuck down.

11:50.459 --> 11:52.821
- Yeah!
- Come on!

12:17.449 --> 12:21.316
<i>Winner... Yuri Boyka!</i>

12:21.420 --> 12:23.042
I'm the best!

12:36.168 --> 12:40.000
Come on! Let me through!
Don't touch him! Come! Come!

12:40.105 --> 12:43.859
- You did it, Boyka! We can no longer wait!
- I told you! I told you!

12:43.964 --> 12:46.626
I never, ever doubted you! Come.

12:46.730 --> 12:49.310
See this crowd? They love you.

12:58.490 --> 13:01.914
- Congratulations, Boyka.
- Very good, Boyka. Very impressive.

13:02.018 --> 13:05.573
It's been a while since we've seen
such an impressive fighter.

13:05.677 --> 13:09.197
Boyka. Two weeks.

13:09.302 --> 13:12.054
We want to see you
at the tournament in Budapest.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.050
- Good.
- So you know...

13:14.154 --> 13:18.097
...this is your one shot.
You win, and you're in the big league.

13:18.556 --> 13:21.109
You lose, and it's over.

13:21.213 --> 13:24.553
I don't lose. I'll be there.

13:24.658 --> 13:26.467
Good.

13:26.571 --> 13:28.487
We'll see you there.

13:29.322 --> 13:33.378
Pretty great, no? This is what you've been
fighting for your whole life, Boyka...

13:33.482 --> 13:35.456
...and now it's here.

13:35.769 --> 13:37.891
Your winnings from tonight's fight.

13:57.700 --> 14:00.577
- What is the matter with him?
- He's in very serious condition.

14:00.681 --> 14:04.197
We're taking him to the hospital.
It looks like a concussion.

14:21.749 --> 14:24.532
Do you think God approves of what you do?

14:29.810 --> 14:31.972
<i>God gave me this gift...</i>

14:32.076 --> 14:34.340
<i>...and it would be a sin to waste it.</i>

15:19.172 --> 15:21.086
Get the fuck out.

15:26.075 --> 15:29.186
- What is it, Boyka?
- The man that I fought last night...

15:29.291 --> 15:32.819
...they took him to the hospital.
How is he doing?

15:32.923 --> 15:35.202
You won. What does it matter how he's doing?

15:35.306 --> 15:37.815
Just answer the fucking question.

15:38.626 --> 15:40.551
He's dead.

15:43.697 --> 15:45.656
What do you mean he's dead?

15:45.760 --> 15:49.273
Don't worry though. It was an accident.
You're not liable for his death.

15:49.377 --> 15:52.992
It's the risk every fighter takes, Boyka.

15:57.811 --> 15:59.728
What was his name?

16:00.513 --> 16:03.670
- Viktor.
- Viktor.

16:04.609 --> 16:06.607
Where did he come from?

16:06.711 --> 16:09.068
He's a Russian from Drovny.

16:09.172 --> 16:11.737
He's just another fighter.

16:11.841 --> 16:16.126
What about his family?
Did he have a wife? Children?

16:16.230 --> 16:20.843
How should I know? I cleaned out
his locker. Forget about him, Boyka.

16:20.947 --> 16:24.287
His things from the locker,
I want to see them.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.603
Here. I got his bag.

16:27.707 --> 16:31.139
He doesn't have any cash. I already checked.

16:53.057 --> 16:56.183
- I need a fake passport.
- A fake passport? For what?

16:56.287 --> 16:58.859
To cross the border. I'm going to Russia.

16:58.964 --> 17:01.896
Russia? Are you crazy?
You're a wanted man there.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.637
- You let me worry about that.
- And what about Budapest?

17:04.742 --> 17:06.563
Your dream? It's in less than two weeks.

17:06.666 --> 17:11.275
- Can you get me the fucking passport or not?
- I can't. It's a mistake.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.944
You get me the fucking passport.

17:18.468 --> 17:21.656
Okay. Okay.

17:22.746 --> 17:26.982
But I must warn you,
this can ruin your life, Boyka.

17:29.290 --> 17:32.101
It's not this life I'm worried about.

19:19.350 --> 19:21.447
My condolences.

19:22.353 --> 19:23.526
Thank you.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.674
Thanks. Thank you for coming.

19:26.778 --> 19:28.391
Thanks.

19:33.084 --> 19:35.382
He was a good man and a good fighter.

19:35.487 --> 19:37.343
Yes.

19:39.313 --> 19:41.383
What will you do now?

19:41.555 --> 19:44.337
We've been together since I was 16.

19:45.356 --> 19:47.286
I don't know anything else.

19:47.390 --> 19:50.367
This is not what I'm talking about.

19:53.468 --> 19:55.669
This is my husband's funeral.

19:55.774 --> 19:57.109
He's dead.

19:57.942 --> 20:02.681
What does it matter now? Except
for the fact that you owe me...

20:02.785 --> 20:04.940
...a lot of money.

20:06.818 --> 20:09.517
I will work for you to pay off the loan.

20:09.829 --> 20:13.495
- You'll get every ruble.
- Let me help.

20:15.475 --> 20:19.307
I can make things easier for you.

20:44.823 --> 20:47.599
- You get the passport?
- You're late.

20:50.161 --> 20:53.523
As your manager, I advise you not to do this.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.154
Just give me the fucking thing.

20:57.423 --> 21:00.624
Boyka, if I can't stop you,
then at least listen to me.

21:00.947 --> 21:02.704
<i>You've gotten used to the outside.</i>

21:02.808 --> 21:05.608
<i>You're going to have
to be very careful going back.</i>

21:05.952 --> 21:08.071
<i>Stay away from commercial buses.</i>

21:08.175 --> 21:12.532
<i>Those will only take you to major
border crossings with tight controls.</i>

21:12.636 --> 21:15.374
<i>The best bet is to get
on a local minivan in Sumy...</i>

21:15.478 --> 21:19.693
<i>...which will drive you across
a provisional military checkpoint.</i>

21:20.713 --> 21:23.849
<i>The soldiers there,
they have no Internet access...</i>

21:23.954 --> 21:27.795
<i>...and generally they are
lax and uninterested.</i>

21:27.899 --> 21:29.993
<i>You keep your head down
and your nose clean...</i>

21:30.097 --> 21:33.630
<i>...and you should get through
without any trouble. After that...</i>

21:33.734 --> 21:35.764
<i>...you're on your own.</i>

21:36.343 --> 21:38.909
Visas, passports, get them out.

21:41.634 --> 21:45.182
Have your papers ready.
Nobody wants to wait on you.

21:52.132 --> 21:54.074
What's your name?

21:55.961 --> 21:59.963
- Anton Lagunov.
- What were you doing in Ukraine?

22:00.832 --> 22:02.945
Visiting my uncle.

22:04.302 --> 22:07.100
He's dying. Is there a problem?

22:08.673 --> 22:11.066
No. No problem. Papers.

22:11.939 --> 22:13.585
Open.

25:17.265 --> 25:20.593
- Let's go.
- I am ready to go.

25:54.824 --> 25:56.716
Can I help you?

25:57.630 --> 26:01.430
- I wanted to speak with her.
- Nobody speaks to her.

26:02.450 --> 26:05.143
- Where are they going?
- She's going to work now.

26:05.247 --> 26:06.923
Where?

27:15.962 --> 27:17.869
Come on!

27:51.382 --> 27:54.548
Igor! Igor! Igor...

27:54.653 --> 27:56.377
Yeah!

28:10.054 --> 28:14.097
<i>And the winner by TKO,
and still undefeated...</i>

28:14.201 --> 28:19.042
<i>...our underground killer, Igor Kazmir!</i>

28:36.190 --> 28:38.625
<i>This is my ring, you motherfuckers!</i>

28:38.729 --> 28:40.926
<i>What else you people think to happen?</i>

28:42.133 --> 28:45.298
<i>This is my ring!</i>

28:50.000 --> 28:51.921
<i>My ring!</i>

29:28.755 --> 29:31.785
Who are you? Are you following me?

29:31.957 --> 29:33.533
No.

29:34.214 --> 29:36.046
I need to talk to you.

29:36.150 --> 29:39.907
- About what? I'm working.
- No, please.

29:40.324 --> 29:42.388
I'm sorry. I...

29:42.493 --> 29:44.483
I come a very long way to talk to you.

29:44.587 --> 29:46.179
Hey.

29:51.397 --> 29:53.619
What do you think you're doing?

29:55.283 --> 29:57.419
Get back to work.

30:01.071 --> 30:03.415
Why don't you come with me?

30:05.958 --> 30:08.348
I just want to talk to her.

30:13.187 --> 30:14.758
Come on.

30:14.863 --> 30:16.584
We'll talk outside.

30:46.253 --> 30:49.911
- You choose the wrong girl. Go home.
- Look, I only need a few minutes with her.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.997
She belongs to the boss, so fuck off.

30:54.916 --> 30:57.426
So what time does she finish work?

31:01.272 --> 31:05.262
Are you deaf? Fuck this asshole up.

31:38.576 --> 31:40.180
Bravo.

31:40.890 --> 31:42.438
Bravo.

31:42.542 --> 31:45.089
That was quite a show you put on.

31:46.041 --> 31:49.317
My name is Zourab, and this is my club.

31:49.422 --> 31:52.751
You should fight for me, here, in my ring.

31:52.855 --> 31:56.944
Not interested. I didn't come here for that.

31:57.048 --> 31:59.162
Why did you come then?

32:03.901 --> 32:06.469
The girl. The waitress.

32:06.573 --> 32:08.664
I need to tell her something.

32:10.645 --> 32:12.292
Alma.

32:13.999 --> 32:17.172
Well, whatever it is you want to tell her...

32:17.277 --> 32:20.880
...you can tell me.
I'll make sure she gets the message.

32:21.068 --> 32:24.074
No, I give her the message myself.

32:24.178 --> 32:27.805
Nobody goes near Alma without my permission.

32:28.430 --> 32:31.186
I own her. I own this city.

32:31.291 --> 32:34.304
You try to talk to her one more time...

32:36.234 --> 32:38.594
...I'll fucking kill you.

32:38.698 --> 32:41.662
Now, get the hell out of my face.

32:43.493 --> 32:45.373
Go on.

32:50.827 --> 32:52.744
Keep an eye on him.

33:00.232 --> 33:02.972
I'm the most complete fighter in the world.

33:10.759 --> 33:13.928
<i>Do you think God approves of what you do?</i>

33:30.954 --> 33:32.994
Where do you think you're going?

33:33.098 --> 33:35.053
Hold it.

34:14.514 --> 34:16.445
You again.

34:17.701 --> 34:19.581
What is it?

34:21.127 --> 34:24.168
I came here today to tell you that...

34:30.784 --> 34:33.145
...I knew your husband, Viktor.

34:34.717 --> 34:36.882
I'm sorry for your loss.

34:42.911 --> 34:44.842
Thank you.

34:45.525 --> 34:48.628
It's very nice of you to come. Thank you.

34:48.732 --> 34:51.338
Your boss, Zourab.

34:52.036 --> 34:53.833
Does he bother you?

34:53.937 --> 34:55.583
No.

34:57.107 --> 34:59.304
He gave Viktor and me a loan...

34:59.409 --> 35:01.999
...so we could open this community center.

35:02.675 --> 35:06.311
I just work for him
to pay off the debt, that's all.

35:08.210 --> 35:11.358
So, where did you meet Viktor?

35:12.259 --> 35:15.220
- Are you a fighter too?
- Yes. I'm a fighter.

35:16.159 --> 35:18.265
I met him in Kiev.

35:18.562 --> 35:20.181
And...

35:20.494 --> 35:22.474
...did you see his last fight?

35:27.274 --> 35:29.222
It was me.

35:30.211 --> 35:33.539
I was the one in the ring, in Kiev.

35:34.849 --> 35:36.736
It was an accident.

35:36.841 --> 35:39.241
I wanted to come here and tell you that.

35:39.345 --> 35:41.947
If there's anything I can do...

35:44.330 --> 35:45.959
Yes.

35:47.095 --> 35:49.650
Yes, there is something you can do.

35:50.456 --> 35:52.236
Bring him back.

35:53.564 --> 35:55.043
Can you do this?

35:59.015 --> 36:00.661
No.

36:05.267 --> 36:09.408
This is the money from the fight.
I think you should have it.

36:09.512 --> 36:11.635
This is blood money.

36:13.116 --> 36:17.479
So that's why you took
my husband's life. You murderer.

36:18.105 --> 36:21.209
Take this back,
and get the hell out of here...

36:21.313 --> 36:23.928
...back to Kiev or wherever
it is that you came from.

36:24.862 --> 36:26.779
Get out.

36:57.194 --> 36:59.992
These are children in front of me, Slava.

37:00.622 --> 37:03.146
It's a waste of my fucking time.

37:03.459 --> 37:06.428
Oleg... just some new guy
down from the north.

37:06.533 --> 37:08.701
He says that we have to see him.

37:08.806 --> 37:10.941
Oleg's guys are minnows.

37:11.045 --> 37:13.584
I need fucking sharks.

37:14.628 --> 37:15.704
Okay.

37:15.808 --> 37:18.916
This is what is available, Zourab.
What do you want?

37:19.229 --> 37:21.159
What do I want?

37:21.710 --> 37:24.546
I want someone to impress me, Slava.

37:24.651 --> 37:27.278
I want someone who knows how to hit...

37:27.383 --> 37:30.084
...and someone who knows how to get hit.

37:30.188 --> 37:32.750
Not these fucking bums
you bring me from the streets...

37:32.855 --> 37:36.023
...who are merely pieces
of meat with a pulse.

37:36.796 --> 37:38.419
Slava.

37:38.773 --> 37:40.654
What do I want?

37:41.071 --> 37:43.502
I want to be fucking entertained!

37:51.815 --> 37:54.180
No. Wait. Wait.

37:54.597 --> 37:58.662
- I thought I told you to leave this town.
- I don't give a shit what you said.

38:04.203 --> 38:07.139
Good. Did you reconsider my offer?

38:09.355 --> 38:11.593
- How much does she owe you?
- Who?

38:11.698 --> 38:14.355
- Alma.
- It's none of your fucking business.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.827
Well, I'm making it my fucking business.

38:16.931 --> 38:20.697
She owes me more than you
can ever possibly pay.

38:22.329 --> 38:24.543
Well, then I want to make a deal.

38:25.391 --> 38:27.287
I fight for you...

38:27.392 --> 38:29.370
...you wipe her debt.

38:45.598 --> 38:47.721
- Six fights.
- Two.

38:48.013 --> 38:51.604
- Three fights.
- And then she owes you nothing.

38:51.709 --> 38:53.602
One condition.

38:53.915 --> 38:56.061
You have to beat my champion.

38:56.165 --> 38:58.072
Watch out.

38:58.385 --> 39:01.580
I'm going to fuck you up.

39:03.712 --> 39:06.584
Just make sure you save
this skunk for the last.

39:06.688 --> 39:09.143
- Good.
- We start tomorrow.

39:09.247 --> 39:11.065
A night's rest in between each.

39:11.170 --> 39:14.528
Three fights a week? You really want to lose.

39:14.633 --> 39:16.371
No.

39:16.475 --> 39:17.963
Just in a hurry.

39:20.904 --> 39:22.458
You have a place I can train?

39:22.562 --> 39:25.734
Sure. There's a gym five blocks east of here.

39:25.839 --> 39:27.965
Slava here will show you.

39:30.572 --> 39:32.262
And one last thing.

39:32.366 --> 39:36.415
It's really nice to do business
with you, Yuri Boyka.

39:37.571 --> 39:40.998
You're surprised.
I told you, this is my town.

39:41.103 --> 39:44.059
I know everything that comes through here.

39:44.163 --> 39:48.056
But don't worry about the police.
They report to me.

39:48.695 --> 39:50.855
Just remember one thing.

39:51.272 --> 39:53.245
My arena...

39:54.275 --> 39:56.197
...my rules.

40:02.383 --> 40:05.178
What are you doing? Some bum off the street?

40:05.282 --> 40:08.218
This is no bum off the streets, Slava.

40:08.948 --> 40:12.081
Don't you know a legend
when he's punching you in the face?

40:12.185 --> 40:14.294
Him? What legend?

40:15.053 --> 40:18.248
Slava, don't you know who Yuri Boyka is?

40:28.547 --> 40:31.335
- <i>Boyka.</i>
- <i>Kiril, I have to stay longer.</i>

40:31.440 --> 40:34.256
- Longer. What do you mean? How much longer?
- <i>Maybe a week.</i>

40:34.360 --> 40:36.919
What do you mean a week? Do you
remember how long you've waited...

40:37.023 --> 40:40.334
...how much you've bled for this moment,
how much money you've spent to fix your knee?

40:40.438 --> 40:44.766
- <i>Do you know what you're doing?</i>
- Just change the fucking bus ticket.

40:44.871 --> 40:47.048
I'll be there.

41:07.314 --> 41:09.509
I didn't ask you to fight for me.

41:09.613 --> 41:12.708
- I just want to help you.
- I don't want your help.

41:12.812 --> 41:16.816
I don't want your money.
I just want you to leave me alone.

41:16.920 --> 41:19.222
I'll leave you alone...

41:19.326 --> 41:21.833
...as soon as I finish the fights.

41:22.755 --> 41:25.091
It's least I can do for you and your husband.

41:25.195 --> 41:27.505
What do you want from me?

41:28.136 --> 41:32.169
- I don't want anything from you.
- You think I'm for sale?

41:32.273 --> 41:34.738
Someone you can just win over in a fight?

41:34.843 --> 41:36.680
I'm not fighting to own you.

41:37.462 --> 41:40.177
I'm fighting to pay your debt...

41:40.281 --> 41:41.706
...so you can be free.

41:44.481 --> 41:47.394
So you came all this way to save me.

41:51.483 --> 41:53.597
I come here to save myself.

41:57.599 --> 42:00.763
Alma, get back in the car. It's time to go.

43:07.927 --> 43:11.079
- What?
- And this is my fucking bag.

43:13.474 --> 43:15.371
I won't be long.

43:16.995 --> 43:18.730
I don't want you using it.

43:26.136 --> 43:27.734
Hey.

43:45.507 --> 43:47.129
It's time.

43:47.233 --> 43:50.399
<i>We have a newcomer tonight,
ladies and gentlemen...</i>

43:50.503 --> 43:52.867
<i>...so place your bets.</i>

43:52.971 --> 43:56.309
<i>In the red corner, a fierce contender...</i>

43:56.413 --> 44:00.444
<i>...Yuri Boyka!</i>

44:13.091 --> 44:16.533
<i>And now, in the blue corner, a local fighter.</i>

44:16.638 --> 44:19.128
<i>He's quick. He's deadly.</i>

44:19.232 --> 44:23.227
<i>He's Boris Tarsov!</i>

44:44.028 --> 44:45.619
Fight!

46:37.278 --> 46:40.034
You can have your fun for now, Yuri Boyka.

46:40.451 --> 46:42.279
But just remember...

46:42.383 --> 46:44.354
...this is my ring.

46:47.589 --> 46:52.513
Well done. Nothing less than I expected,
but don't get too comfortable.

46:52.618 --> 46:54.967
First one is always easy.

46:59.474 --> 47:02.422
Why don't you get our winner here a drink?

47:21.239 --> 47:22.851
Here.

47:24.762 --> 47:26.723
You must be thirsty.

47:27.961 --> 47:29.938
Thank you.

47:35.002 --> 47:37.554
Do you know a place where I can train?

47:37.971 --> 47:41.021
Yes. There is a gym down the street.

47:41.125 --> 47:44.930
No, that place, it's overrun with rats.

47:51.614 --> 47:54.333
Come by the community center tomorrow.

47:54.438 --> 47:56.581
You can use the one there.

48:01.787 --> 48:04.148
I'm fighting for your boss now.

48:04.253 --> 48:06.586
You going to try and stop me again?

48:14.756 --> 48:16.687
It's not much...

48:17.104 --> 48:19.468
...but if you like it, you can use it.

48:21.615 --> 48:23.495
Very good.

48:50.440 --> 48:53.594
Hey. Stop bothering the man. Let him work.

48:53.698 --> 48:56.642
- No! Please!
- It's fine.

48:57.580 --> 48:59.749
It's okay. Let them stay.

49:23.193 --> 49:25.311
Do you need something?

49:25.415 --> 49:27.575
I just needed water.

49:31.140 --> 49:34.143
It's not bothering you, the... the training?

49:34.247 --> 49:36.338
No. I'm used to it.

49:38.493 --> 49:40.730
Viktor never stopped training.

49:41.320 --> 49:43.265
Day or night.

49:52.598 --> 49:55.563
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

49:55.667 --> 50:01.707
<i>...double your bets because we have
something special for you tonight.</i>

50:01.811 --> 50:04.796
<i>The Ozerov Brothers!</i>

50:05.302 --> 50:08.935
<i>That's right!
That's right, ladies and gentlemen!</i>

50:09.039 --> 50:11.212
<i>Two against one!</i>

50:11.316 --> 50:14.484
<i>Two for price of one!</i>

50:21.446 --> 50:23.433
Remember, Boyka...

50:23.537 --> 50:27.953
...my arena, my rules.
Now, let's see what you can do.

50:44.491 --> 50:46.117
Fight!

52:04.842 --> 52:06.413
Finish him!

53:00.353 --> 53:02.235
I hope you're ready.

53:03.556 --> 53:05.903
I've kicked the shit out of worse.

53:07.210 --> 53:10.429
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka...

53:14.766 --> 53:18.770
<i>And the winner by double knockout...</i>

53:18.875 --> 53:22.053
<i>...Yuri Boyka!</i>

53:47.345 --> 53:50.538
Koychev, my friend. Here.

53:52.538 --> 53:55.970
Get rid of those who can't
keep their mouth shut.

54:07.019 --> 54:10.026
And the other stack? What's that for?

54:10.130 --> 54:11.863
Proposition.

54:12.695 --> 54:15.326
I want you to get me Koshmar.

54:15.430 --> 54:17.951
Koshmar the Nightmare?

54:18.056 --> 54:20.217
I want him here.

54:24.206 --> 54:26.288
That's impossible.

54:26.392 --> 54:29.369
I can't get him out of prison anymore.

54:30.175 --> 54:32.611
Last time almost cost me my job.

54:32.715 --> 54:34.639
Yes, you can.

54:38.517 --> 54:41.057
You're not gonna just make more money.

54:41.161 --> 54:44.833
It's a bonus. I'm gonna
give you an escaped convict.

54:44.937 --> 54:46.855
Yuri Boyka.

55:49.757 --> 55:51.656
My husband...

55:51.760 --> 55:54.294
...used to train after matches too.

55:54.398 --> 55:58.382
He said it was the best time,
when the muscles still hurt.

56:00.536 --> 56:02.157
Here.

56:03.569 --> 56:05.660
Ointment for your back.

56:08.124 --> 56:10.294
My grandmother's recipe.

56:34.270 --> 56:35.868
Give it to me.

56:35.972 --> 56:38.952
- It's fine. I...
- It's okay. Give it to me.

56:40.873 --> 56:42.799
Sit down.

57:15.349 --> 57:17.666
You don't have to fight for me, you know.

57:19.711 --> 57:22.351
You can leave this town anytime you want.

57:22.873 --> 57:24.785
Why don't you leave here?

57:26.355 --> 57:29.515
Just take whatever you need
and get the hell out.

57:30.496 --> 57:32.422
To leave?

57:34.167 --> 57:36.694
This place was our dream.

57:36.798 --> 57:40.866
This center. The kids here know
that I will never abandon them.

57:41.387 --> 57:43.296
Without a place like this...

57:43.401 --> 57:47.174
...all of these kids would be
in gangs or something worse.

57:47.764 --> 57:50.707
But you probably wouldn't know
anything about it.

57:52.640 --> 57:54.602
You can keep the rest.

58:21.498 --> 58:23.093
Slava.

58:23.675 --> 58:26.703
- Did you men watch Boyka?
- Yes, just like you said...

58:26.808 --> 58:28.981
...for the whole time that he was there.

58:29.085 --> 58:30.556
And?

58:30.660 --> 58:34.252
He just trains. That's it.
Two hours. And then he leaves.

58:34.356 --> 58:36.525
And she? What does she do?

58:36.629 --> 58:39.496
Nothing. She doesn't even talk to him.

58:39.601 --> 58:42.138
She can barely even look at him.

58:56.137 --> 58:58.295
You work too hard.

58:59.215 --> 59:01.403
I don't have a choice.

59:05.187 --> 59:07.319
Please don't touch me.

59:07.423 --> 59:09.018
Why?

59:10.596 --> 59:12.749
Is it because of Boyka?

59:13.062 --> 59:16.532
I hear he spends time here. Too much time.

59:16.637 --> 59:18.992
He just needs a place to train.

59:19.305 --> 59:22.295
He's an animal, a cold-blooded killer...

59:22.400 --> 59:25.748
...the man that murdered your husband.

59:31.114 --> 59:35.147
- That was an accident.
- Was it truly an accident...

59:35.251 --> 59:39.012
...when his fists pounded
into your husband's skull...

59:39.116 --> 59:41.320
...over and over...

59:41.424 --> 59:45.019
- ...and over again?
- Please. Stop it.

59:46.532 --> 59:48.717
That's not how it happened.

59:49.947 --> 59:52.301
You're fucking him, aren't you?

59:54.937 --> 59:56.825
How dare you.

59:57.469 --> 01:00:00.005
You know how much I love Viktor.

01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:03.536
- I want you to leave right now.
- No.

01:00:04.359 --> 01:00:07.176
Please, let go of me.

01:00:10.282 --> 01:00:14.738
He's not allowed here.
I'll fucking kill him if you let him back in.

01:00:44.153 --> 01:00:45.156
Kiril.

01:00:45.261 --> 01:00:49.241
Boyka. The arena is already crawling
with fans waiting to see you.

01:00:49.345 --> 01:00:52.320
<i>Your name has been published in all
the newspapers and the billboards.</i>

01:00:52.424 --> 01:00:54.422
- That's good.
- Don't forget.

01:00:54.526 --> 01:00:58.562
Your bus is at 9:45 p.m. tonight.
Don't be late.

01:00:58.667 --> 01:01:02.862
- <i>The press is waiting to talk to you.</i>
- Don't worry. I'll be there.

01:01:17.219 --> 01:01:19.394
What are you doing here?

01:01:20.848 --> 01:01:22.980
The fight with my husband.

01:01:24.621 --> 01:01:26.724
Can you tell me what happened?

01:01:27.989 --> 01:01:30.736
I think it's better
if we don't talk about it.

01:01:31.153 --> 01:01:32.760
Why?

01:01:33.386 --> 01:01:35.547
Do you have something to hide?

01:01:37.339 --> 01:01:39.568
I just don't want to hurt you.

01:01:39.672 --> 01:01:41.604
I can take it.

01:01:45.362 --> 01:01:48.517
Just look into my eyes and tell me the truth.

01:01:49.247 --> 01:01:51.577
Was it really an accident?

01:01:54.723 --> 01:01:57.495
I've done things in this life, Alma.

01:01:59.669 --> 01:02:01.833
Terrible things.

01:02:02.579 --> 01:02:05.931
Things that put me in prison for a long time.

01:02:06.899 --> 01:02:08.870
And I was a bitter...

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:12.428
...angry man, full of hate...

01:02:12.949 --> 01:02:16.073
...until God showed me the path.

01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:19.841
I've had hundreds of fights.

01:02:19.945 --> 01:02:21.513
Hundreds.

01:02:21.617 --> 01:02:27.164
In the shittiest arenas to the darkest,
deepest hell-hole prisons...

01:02:27.268 --> 01:02:28.816
...you can possibly imagine.

01:02:28.921 --> 01:02:33.369
But I never lost sight
of the gift God gave me.

01:02:36.298 --> 01:02:38.415
And then one day...

01:02:39.241 --> 01:02:40.827
...God...

01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:44.515
...he opened up the doors to me
and gave me the chance...

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:47.918
...to prove myself to the world.

01:02:48.022 --> 01:02:52.003
He was testing me,
and I was not going to disappoint him.

01:02:53.815 --> 01:02:55.712
And so...

01:02:56.244 --> 01:02:59.874
...in the ring with Viktor...

01:03:01.762 --> 01:03:03.907
...I did not see a man.

01:03:05.562 --> 01:03:08.284
I did not see a husband.

01:03:10.466 --> 01:03:14.646
Only someone standing in
between me and my dream.

01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:19.956
And I did not mean to kill him.

01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:23.949
I'm sorry.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.297
And I know it's not enough
to take away your pain.

01:03:27.401 --> 01:03:29.172
But I regret it.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.768
I regret it with all my soul.

01:03:51.644 --> 01:03:54.145
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:03:54.552 --> 01:03:58.769
<i>...we have a spectacular show
for you tonight.</i>

01:03:59.515 --> 01:04:03.115
<i>So place your bets and take your seats.</i>

01:04:03.219 --> 01:04:06.720
<i>In the red corner,
we have a fearsome fighter...</i>

01:04:06.825 --> 01:04:09.213
<i>...who's been undefeated so far.</i>

01:04:09.317 --> 01:04:15.182
<i>So let's hear it for Yuri Boyka!</i>

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:18.304
Let's go, Boyka!

01:04:39.347 --> 01:04:41.453
<i>And in the blue corner...</i>

01:04:41.557 --> 01:04:44.121
<i>...the big bad man-killer...</i>

01:04:44.226 --> 01:04:48.325
<i>...our undisputed Drovny
underground champion...</i>

01:04:48.429 --> 01:04:51.786
<i>...Igor Kazmir!</i>

01:04:59.201 --> 01:05:04.039
- You're fucking dead!
- Igor! Igor! Igor...

01:05:04.327 --> 01:05:05.937
Fight!

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:17.886
Welcome to my world, motherfucker.
Remember what I told you?

01:05:18.376 --> 01:05:21.794
- It's my ring. I'm going to fuck you...
- It's your ring. I know.

01:06:42.378 --> 01:06:44.149
Come on!

01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:06.213
Boyka!

01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:18.334
Stop!

01:08:19.299 --> 01:08:21.411
Stop! Stop!

01:08:25.921 --> 01:08:29.136
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka...

01:08:38.594 --> 01:08:41.982
The champion! The champion!

01:09:01.999 --> 01:09:03.953
Come on.

01:09:48.862 --> 01:09:50.837
Very good fight, Boyka.

01:09:53.059 --> 01:09:55.022
Where you going?

01:09:55.563 --> 01:09:57.902
I have a bus to catch. It's over.

01:09:58.006 --> 01:10:00.004
She's free.

01:10:00.108 --> 01:10:02.001
What's over?

01:10:05.373 --> 01:10:07.322
We had a deal.

01:10:07.729 --> 01:10:12.414
Yes. The deal was three fights
and you have to beat my champion.

01:10:13.230 --> 01:10:15.982
What does that fucking look like to you?

01:10:16.399 --> 01:10:20.289
Who, this guy? He's not my champion.
He was your third fight.

01:10:20.393 --> 01:10:24.417
- Now you have to defeat my champion.
- This is fucking bullshit.

01:10:27.903 --> 01:10:31.907
- I'm not fighting for you anymore.
- Yes, you are, Boyka.

01:10:32.219 --> 01:10:34.506
'Cause if you don't...

01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:36.929
...then we don't have a deal.

01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:40.456
Don't you want to save her?

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:43.589
Don't you want to be her hero?

01:10:43.693 --> 01:10:47.522
You walk away now,
and her debt still remains.

01:10:47.627 --> 01:10:51.277
Unless you want me to sell her like
a piece of meat, you're going to fight.

01:10:51.381 --> 01:10:54.581
And after my champion crushes your skull...

01:10:54.686 --> 01:10:56.623
...you and I will be done...

01:10:56.727 --> 01:10:59.514
...and the girl will be mine.

01:11:12.047 --> 01:11:14.651
Are you already at the bus station?

01:11:15.784 --> 01:11:17.134
I cannot leave yet.

01:11:17.238 --> 01:11:21.386
Are you crazy? What is wrong with you?
Your bus leaves in 15 minutes.

01:11:21.491 --> 01:11:24.885
- What time is the last bus?
- 10:00 p.m.

01:11:24.989 --> 01:11:27.473
If you miss it, you won't catch
your flight to Budapest.

01:11:27.838 --> 01:11:29.725
I won't miss it.

01:11:34.235 --> 01:11:36.550
So what are we waiting for?

01:11:37.228 --> 01:11:39.737
Bring me your fucking champion.

01:11:42.102 --> 01:11:46.177
<i>And now for the main event of the night...</i>

01:11:46.281 --> 01:11:50.085
<i>...a true monster fresh out of prison...</i>

01:11:50.189 --> 01:11:54.445
<i>...Koshmar the Nightmare!</i>

01:12:19.856 --> 01:12:21.481
Fight!

01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:23.375
One!

01:13:26.227 --> 01:13:27.801
Two!

01:13:30.469 --> 01:13:32.080
Three!

01:13:34.614 --> 01:13:35.864
Four!

01:13:39.094 --> 01:13:40.699
Five!

01:13:43.865 --> 01:13:45.511
Six!

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.631
Seven!

01:13:52.173 --> 01:13:53.744
Eight!

01:13:55.855 --> 01:13:59.195
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka...

01:14:15.496 --> 01:14:17.388
Come on.

01:16:54.150 --> 01:16:56.051
Call Koychev.

01:17:04.433 --> 01:17:07.179
- Zourab!
- Let go of me!

01:17:37.565 --> 01:17:38.973
No!

01:17:42.307 --> 01:17:43.894
No!

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:20.348
This is what happens
when you don't give me what I want.

01:18:22.002 --> 01:18:24.306
And you choose a murderer...

01:18:24.889 --> 01:18:26.771
...an animal!

01:18:38.141 --> 01:18:40.152
Didn't I make it clear to you?

01:18:40.256 --> 01:18:42.666
Didn't I give you every fucking opportunity?

01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:45.648
Every opportunity I gave you.

01:18:58.992 --> 01:19:01.592
Now you're going to watch him die.

01:19:44.193 --> 01:19:47.062
Drop the gun. Drop it.

01:19:54.874 --> 01:19:56.708
We had a deal.

01:19:56.812 --> 01:19:59.632
You piece of shit. Let her go.

01:19:59.736 --> 01:20:03.310
And what? What do you think
is going to happen?

01:20:03.415 --> 01:20:06.584
You're an escaped convict, Boyka.

01:20:06.689 --> 01:20:08.579
What can you possibly give her?

01:20:08.683 --> 01:20:11.578
You're a fucking washed-up,
two-bit fighter...

01:20:11.682 --> 01:20:14.894
...just like her fucking dead husband.

01:20:57.615 --> 01:21:00.972
You're hurt. We have to get you to a doctor.

01:21:01.076 --> 01:21:02.685
Alma.

01:21:03.155 --> 01:21:05.554
I need to ask you something.

01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:08.351
The day you came to see me...

01:21:08.456 --> 01:21:11.521
...you asked me what it was
I wanted from you.

01:21:11.959 --> 01:21:15.171
I did not know how to say it at the time.

01:21:15.692 --> 01:21:18.147
I needed to ask you...

01:21:18.251 --> 01:21:20.645
...for your forgiveness.

01:21:22.197 --> 01:21:24.583
For what I did to your husband.

01:21:30.916 --> 01:21:34.339
Come on. We can still get you out of here.

01:21:34.443 --> 01:21:38.053
- Please.
- No. I need to know.

01:21:40.841 --> 01:21:42.938
Can you forgive me?

01:22:07.693 --> 01:22:11.311
Yuri Boyka, you're under arrest.

01:22:12.573 --> 01:22:14.709
Do you forgive me?

01:23:10.190 --> 01:23:12.739
It's good to see you, Yuri.

01:23:13.138 --> 01:23:16.724
- How have you been?
- I'm fine.

01:23:17.775 --> 01:23:20.337
I did not expect to see you.

01:23:22.761 --> 01:23:24.664
How are the kids?

01:23:25.446 --> 01:23:28.827
They're doing great. Look.

01:23:29.313 --> 01:23:31.839
They drew these pictures for you.

01:23:46.601 --> 01:23:48.527
I'm sorry.

01:23:49.296 --> 01:23:52.484
I wanted to come visit earlier,
but I couldn't.

01:23:53.512 --> 01:23:55.658
I wasn't ready.

01:23:56.411 --> 01:23:58.310
I understand.

01:24:00.136 --> 01:24:04.785
When I first saw you,
I didn't know what to say or do.

01:24:05.411 --> 01:24:08.076
I was too angry. I was...

01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:09.872
...lost.

01:24:10.132 --> 01:24:12.516
But then you showed me something.

01:24:13.728 --> 01:24:16.844
You showed me that there was
still good in the world...

01:24:16.948 --> 01:24:19.506
...and that's why I came here today.

01:24:20.323 --> 01:24:22.172
To thank you, Yuri...

01:24:22.475 --> 01:24:25.260
...for giving me back my dignity...

01:24:25.781 --> 01:24:27.582
...my freedom.

01:24:29.169 --> 01:24:32.361
And because I want you to know that...

01:24:35.646 --> 01:24:37.266
...I forgive you.

01:25:06.251 --> 01:25:07.805
Thank you.
