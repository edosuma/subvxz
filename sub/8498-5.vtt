<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:29.920 --> 00:32.387
<i>We were moving
from a time of guessing,</i>

00:32.640 --> 00:35.234
<i>of old wives' tales and superstition,</i>

00:35.560 --> 00:38.393
<i>to one of statistics, data.</i>

00:38.600 --> 00:43.276
<i>Suddenly, everything seemed to have
a price, a weight, a value.</i>

00:44.000 --> 00:46.355
<i>Life and even death</i>

00:46.720 --> 00:50.554
<i>began to be measured
in percentages and probability.</i>

01:01.120 --> 01:02.997
Ta-da! Hot off the press.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.553
Is that the health report?

01:04.760 --> 01:06.000
I feel a drum roll is in order.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.435
Well, shall we see how we fared?

01:08.520 --> 01:10.640
Thought it might at least be
the new James Bond novel.

01:10.680 --> 01:11.999
Far more exciting.

01:12.080 --> 01:15.629
Patrick Turner, GP,
licensed to practise medicine

01:15.880 --> 01:20.954
and secret agent, Shelagh Turnova,
save Poplar from ill health and disease.

01:25.360 --> 01:26.475
That's it, ladies.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.912
If we want to reduce,
we must keep moving!

01:30.960 --> 01:32.837
And make sure you all have enough room.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.718
No injuries tonight, please.

01:39.720 --> 01:40.720
That's it!

01:41.000 --> 01:42.035
Oh, sorry!

01:44.280 --> 01:46.111
And everybody sitting.

01:48.280 --> 01:49.633
Bottoms firmly on the floor.

01:50.320 --> 01:53.039
And arms up and arms down.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.799
And now we raise our legs
as if we're pedalling a bicycle.

01:56.240 --> 01:59.994
Keeping the arms moving,
and pedal, and pedal.

02:00.760 --> 02:03.638
Oh, sorry, Miss Franklin!

02:03.920 --> 02:05.512
My bikes got a puncture.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
You may dismount.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.032
Just this once, Mrs Buckle.

02:09.240 --> 02:12.073
And pedal, and pedal...

02:12.800 --> 02:15.314
36 deaths from neoplasms of the lung.

02:16.160 --> 02:17.559
Patrick, that's cancer.

02:19.320 --> 02:22.232
Makes the timing
of my chest clinic rather relevant.

02:24.280 --> 02:28.034
Hopefully, we can put right some of
the damage of Poplar's bad air.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.080
"Bad air"?
Do you read the <i>Lancer?</i>

02:32.080 --> 02:34.833
- They say smoking causes tumours.
- One school of thought.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.116
- Supported by the government.
- Thank you.

02:37.480 --> 02:39.914
We're also better at diagnosing,
these days.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.714
In itself, that appears
to lead to an increase in numbers.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.835
Oh, not here, Nurse.
Not in front of the gents.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.353
It's my you-know-what.

02:57.480 --> 02:58.993
Take a seat, Mrs Cadmen.

03:02.840 --> 03:03.840
It's got to stop.

03:04.280 --> 03:07.238
We can't have women
too embarrassed to handle the samples

03:07.360 --> 03:08.634
because men are present.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.080
I'm rather more disappointed
at being given urine as a gift.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.990
I think the men are quite
a comfort to their wives.

03:14.280 --> 03:15.633
Well, they're no comfort to me.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.548
Ah, gentlemen, we're short of space.

03:22.760 --> 03:24.352
If you'd repair to the corridor.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.238
Please come through, Mrs Dawley.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.309
Can you manage, my dear?

03:29.800 --> 03:31.870
Today, if you would, Mr Dawley.

03:33.360 --> 03:36.272
I was hearing about how
the baby shouldn't sleep on its back.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.073
In case it gets sick.

03:38.640 --> 03:39.914
And it got me to thinking,

03:40.520 --> 03:41.953
what would make it sick?

03:42.280 --> 03:45.158
Oh, there are lots of little things.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.629
All babies get gripes and upsets.

03:49.160 --> 03:50.513
Such as what, Nurse?

03:51.240 --> 03:53.435
Have you had a little look
at the pamphlet I gave you?

03:54.440 --> 03:55.634
I misplaced it.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.080
I'll get you another one.

03:59.200 --> 04:02.556
But wind, over-feeding.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.710
They're very common, Mrs Dawley.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.034
You mustn't worry.

04:08.280 --> 04:11.158
But who do I telephone,
if it does get sick?

04:11.840 --> 04:13.478
Us, Mrs Dawley.

04:14.240 --> 04:16.879
Any time, day or night.

04:18.040 --> 04:21.077
Even if you have plumped
for a hospital delivery over us.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.679
Cos they keep you in for 10 days,

04:23.560 --> 04:25.835
till they're quite sure
you're ready to be at home,

04:25.920 --> 04:27.876
and till they're sure baby's ready, too.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.392
You and baby will be a pair.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.153
You'll be ready together.

04:36.320 --> 04:37.753
That's the spirit!

04:39.240 --> 04:41.117
I can feel the pounds falling off!

04:41.200 --> 04:43.316
Oh, well, you always were an optimist.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.192
Hey, do you reckon I can sign up?

04:45.400 --> 04:46.594
- Eh?
- Oh, yeah.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.116
I could get myself a new vest.

04:49.440 --> 04:50.680
Look at this, look, look, look.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.508
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, Fred!

04:56.880 --> 04:58.552
- You all right?
- Oh! Oh, no!

04:58.880 --> 05:00.950
Oh, I can't move! It's my back.

05:01.240 --> 05:03.196
Oh! Oh, dear. Oh!

05:05.720 --> 05:07.438
You do that beautiful.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.278
Fred's mum always did the flowers.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.668
It's where he got
his love of incense and whatnot.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.239
Oh!

05:20.120 --> 05:23.476
What do they say these days about baby?

05:24.960 --> 05:27.394
I don't quite know.
Not got to it just yet.

05:29.200 --> 05:32.158
Sir says I'm to come each day
when the baby's here.

05:33.480 --> 05:35.436
Keep the house
the way it's always been.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.776
Something so small can't make
so much mess can it, Mrs Dash?

05:37.800 --> 05:41.793
That little scrap's gonna be the biggest
thing that ever came into your life.

05:43.240 --> 05:45.435
But, better get on now, Mrs Dawley.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.073
What a gentleman you look.

05:58.520 --> 06:00.192
It's not too elaborate, the waistcoat?

06:01.280 --> 06:03.919
I'm hoping the church
on Isherwood Lane will take my incense.

06:04.440 --> 06:05.440
Did you drink your milk?

06:07.160 --> 06:09.594
Pint and a half a day.
For the calcium.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.918
Mother swore by it,
and I'm fit as a flea.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.358
Even at this grand old age.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.559
Whatever you wish.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.231
Mrs Dash says she's to come more often.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.389
You don't mind, do you?

06:23.960 --> 06:25.996
I like her coming. It's company.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.678
You spend too much time
with me and Mrs Dash.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.757
A pair of old slippers when
you should have dancing shoes.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.432
Who else would tell me stories?

06:37.040 --> 06:38.792
Tell me where frankincense came from

06:39.720 --> 06:41.756
or the myrrh oil Christ was washed in?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.718
I'm blessed, Roseanne, with you.

06:47.440 --> 06:48.873
And now I've a child.

06:52.520 --> 06:54.670
Now, very slowly, straighten up.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.830
Oh! Argh, ow!

07:00.080 --> 07:01.957
It's a nasty spasm in your back.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.240
We'll need something flat and strong,
ideally a door.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.720
Can't you just give her some pills?

07:08.200 --> 07:09.679
To go under the mattress.

07:10.760 --> 07:14.469
We need to keep the back supported.
Now, rest and Aspirin.

07:15.160 --> 07:19.073
And perhaps some mentholatum ointment
when the pain has subsided a little.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.400
What kind of door?

07:21.280 --> 07:23.396
- Any door.
- Handle on or off?

07:24.240 --> 07:27.152
Mrs Buckle will be lying on it,
not opening it, Fred.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.439
Not my bathroom door!

07:30.880 --> 07:33.713
We may be married,
but I do still have my dignity.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.957
So rest overnight then, Doctor?

07:39.280 --> 07:41.555
Mrs Buckle, you will need to rest
for a week.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.234
Perhaps two.

07:43.640 --> 07:47.599
A back spasm is a warning shot,
we ignore it at our peril.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.399
But I've got the shop.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.876
- And it must wait.
- Oh!

07:54.280 --> 07:57.670
O-L-D.

08:07.680 --> 08:08.749
Oh!

08:11.040 --> 08:12.189
Oh!

08:23.280 --> 08:25.316
Not yet, please. I'm not ready.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.833
<i>The pain! Help me!</i>

08:29.120 --> 08:31.759
Ah, Mrs Dawley, 15 Lintel Street.
I have you.

08:32.159 --> 08:34.309
Now, try to breathe, Mrs Dawley.

08:34.559 --> 08:36.232
Oh, it hurts so much.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.037
The midwife said three weeks.

08:39.240 --> 08:42.471
There's water all over my settee,
from down there.

08:42.559 --> 08:44.869
Is there someone with you, Mrs Dawley?

08:45.240 --> 08:48.516
No. There's no-one. I'm alone.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.355
Now, breathe through it.

08:54.640 --> 08:57.154
I'm going to stay on
the telephone till it's passed,

08:57.560 --> 08:59.596
and then I'm going
to come straight to you.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.390
Well, all right, Mrs Dawley.
Now, is the front door unlocked?

09:07.080 --> 09:10.038
The spare's under the mat.
Please come!

09:10.600 --> 09:13.956
I'll be with you in five minutes.
Stay exactly where you are.

09:18.280 --> 09:20.191
We've been caught out,
in terms of the rota.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.829
Everyone's on rounds
and Mrs Dawley's three weeks early.

09:22.920 --> 09:25.070
Now, you're simply
to answer the telephone.

09:25.280 --> 09:28.716
If a patient calls, go straight to
the maternity home for Nurse Mount.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.757
- Are you clear?
- Crystal. Now go.

09:32.840 --> 09:36.037
Our consumption of milk has run
away with us since you arrived.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.160
Your bones must have
the strength of oxen.

09:39.360 --> 09:40.588
I do like a milky brew.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.479
Don't fail me now.

10:00.240 --> 10:03.596
- Oh, oh, oh, ow!
- Sorry, sorry.

10:05.160 --> 10:08.038
Oh! Oh!

10:08.840 --> 10:11.513
- You gonna be all right on the settee?
- Yes, of course I am.

10:12.640 --> 10:16.315
Now, if you need anything at all...

10:16.880 --> 10:19.838
You just ring that bell, I'm on call.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.274
I'd kiss you if I could move.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.320
Ow!

10:40.040 --> 10:41.792
- Nonnatus House.
<i>- Its Roseanne Dawley.</i>

10:42.360 --> 10:44.351
Where's the midwife?
She said she'd be here.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.312
Midwife's on her way, Mrs Dawley.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.576
<i>She'll be with you any moment now.</i>

10:47.600 --> 10:51.434
Oh, Lord, help me.
It feels like I'm gonna burst.

10:52.440 --> 10:55.637
- I can't hold on!
- Oh, cripes!

10:56.160 --> 10:59.436
Sister Monica Joan,
I need you to fetch me a midwife.

10:59.960 --> 11:03.748
We are quite alone, and you
are simply to answer the telephone.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.117
I need you to go to the maternity home
and fetch Nurse Mount.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.216
I am not to be trusted
with clinical matters.

11:09.240 --> 11:12.596
We have an emergency.
Please fetch a midwife.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.552
I shall go at once.

11:15.600 --> 11:18.512
Midwife's on her way.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.720
<i>I'm going to stay on the telephone
with you until she gets to you.</i>

11:22.000 --> 11:23.480
<i>There's no need to worry, Mrs Dawley.</i>

11:26.480 --> 11:28.198
Oh, Lord, help me.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.998
I'm bleeding!

11:31.720 --> 11:33.950
<i>- Help me!</i>
- Think. Think.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.475
Help me!

11:37.720 --> 11:39.597
Listen to me now, Roseanne.

11:40.440 --> 11:41.440
I'm right here.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.394
<i>Now, I need you kneeling down.
Can you do that?</i>

11:45.640 --> 11:47.119
Yes.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.072
I'm scared!

11:53.320 --> 11:55.436
I'm so afraid.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.068
Don't be.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.428
Everything will be all right.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.992
It's all right, Roseanne.
You're doing brilliantly.

12:10.080 --> 12:14.312
<i>Wait for the contraction to pass.
Try and breathe through it.</i>

12:17.400 --> 12:20.995
Look, can you reach a towel,
or a blanket, anything like that?

12:22.280 --> 12:23.679
There's nothing.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.390
Help me! Help me!

12:27.360 --> 12:28.952
Where is she?

12:29.760 --> 12:31.480
You said she was coming,
she should be here.

12:34.760 --> 12:36.910
<i>Midwife is coming. She's on her way.</i>

12:37.720 --> 12:40.871
<i>I need you to take off your cardigan,
or anything loose you have on.</i>

12:41.600 --> 12:43.397
<i>Baby will need it.</i>

12:55.240 --> 12:57.151
<i>Something's coming out.</i>

12:57.760 --> 12:59.352
God, it's coming!

13:00.040 --> 13:01.519
Roseanne, breathe.

13:02.760 --> 13:04.352
<i>We need to slow baby down.</i>

13:04.720 --> 13:07.234
I need you to breathe very gently,
little breaths.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.191
<i>Do that for me now.</i>

13:09.280 --> 13:13.114
Roseanne, this is very important,
it's to protect baby. Now breathe!

13:16.440 --> 13:19.637
You're doing so, so well, Roseanne.

13:20.320 --> 13:23.153
Real deep, in and out.

13:23.640 --> 13:25.676
- Very gently now.
- I can't do this.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.630
I can't have this baby.

13:29.520 --> 13:32.159
You're doing brilliantly, Roseanne.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.717
Focus on your breathing, in and out.

13:36.400 --> 13:39.039
<i>In and out.</i>

13:41.840 --> 13:43.068
Roseanne?

13:43.840 --> 13:45.159
Talk to me.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.911
Let me know you're still there.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.108
Roseanne?

14:10.200 --> 14:11.428
It's out.

14:12.440 --> 14:13.998
It's not moving.

14:15.360 --> 14:16.360
Is baby breathing?

14:16.680 --> 14:19.114
- Why won't it move?
- I need you to take hold of baby.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.078
Careful, because he'll be slippery.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.873
Do you have him?
Do you have baby?

14:27.280 --> 14:29.794
Wipe his mouth, we need
to remove any fluid. Do that now.

14:30.360 --> 14:31.759
The baby won't move.

14:33.440 --> 14:37.194
It's me. Oh, God, I'm done for.

14:39.160 --> 14:41.515
Rub baby's back, good and firm.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.159
<i>Now, Roseanne. Right away.</i>

14:46.440 --> 14:49.557
- Good firm rub now.
- I've ruined it.

14:50.880 --> 14:54.350
Roseanne, rub your baby now.

14:55.840 --> 14:58.718
<i>Come on, Roseanne. Baby needs you.</i>

15:01.600 --> 15:03.477
<i>- It's not working.</i>
- Keep going.

15:05.160 --> 15:09.199
<i>Keep going, till your baby breathes.
Come on, Roseanne.</i>

15:18.280 --> 15:20.589
<i>Keep him warm, hold him to you.</i>

15:21.840 --> 15:22.955
Midwife's coming.

15:37.400 --> 15:40.437
Roseanne, boy or girl?

15:41.240 --> 15:42.878
<i>Girl.</i>

15:44.480 --> 15:45.708
I've got a little girl.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.313
Midwife. Mrs Dawley, I'm so sorry.

15:55.360 --> 15:58.318
Well done, Roseanne. Well done.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.476
<i>I'll take it from here, Nurse Busby.
Thank you.</i>

16:07.720 --> 16:09.358
You've been so brave.

16:09.440 --> 16:11.237
Look at what you've managed.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.718
You're a mother now, Roseanne.

16:29.720 --> 16:30.994
Nurse Busby,

16:31.320 --> 16:33.959
without your quick-thinking
and calmness,

16:34.520 --> 16:36.715
today may have ended very differently.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.480
I only did what you all do every day.

16:39.960 --> 16:42.110
The difference is,
we've been trained for it.

16:42.360 --> 16:45.796
I was a bit rusty, but those obstetric
lectures never leave you. Do they?

16:46.080 --> 16:47.718
Not if you're taught by Mr Slade.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.696
If they could bottle that man,
we could do away with gassing them.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.676
A more numbing fellow
you couldn't find.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.070
It's been ages since we had a BBA.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.472
Born before arrival of a midwife.

16:58.720 --> 17:01.951
BBB, born before bicycle.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.349
Wretched things.
I don't know how you manage them.

17:05.079 --> 17:07.195
Well, that's telephone duty sorted out.

17:07.599 --> 17:10.672
I'll be washing my hair
and reading magazines from now on.

17:11.560 --> 17:15.234
I have to admit, it's a lot more
rewarding than male surgical.

17:15.599 --> 17:18.797
I have always assumed
the results of the male organ

17:19.240 --> 17:21.595
to be more rewarding
than the organ, itself.

17:25.079 --> 17:26.115
To Nurse Busby.

17:26.280 --> 17:29.716
We could not wish
for a more trusted reserve.

17:30.360 --> 17:31.759
Nurse Busby.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.910
This little thing that we've created
is so entirely perfect.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.355
I know what my mother meant
by not fully knowing love

17:43.120 --> 17:45.998
or fear, until she had me.

17:52.240 --> 17:55.312
Fred, I've spilt my water.

17:56.640 --> 17:57.914
Oh, coming, my love.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.748
Oh! Ow!

18:03.320 --> 18:05.515
Although strictly a volunteer helper,

18:05.800 --> 18:09.190
I'd hope to see my good work
reflected in this week's pocket money.

18:09.680 --> 18:10.999
I'm sure you would.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.235
Thank you for coming.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.995
I know for some of you,
it took a great deal of effort.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.756
This is Dr Turner's first chest clinic

18:28.880 --> 18:31.075
for chronic pulmonary
and bronchial conditions.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.389
Good day, Mr Phillips.

18:32.480 --> 18:35.358
To help you manage with
a little more comfort at home.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.679
And open wide, please.

18:42.520 --> 18:47.230
Postural drainage, where the head
is lower than the lungs

18:47.600 --> 18:50.672
is a simple, but effective way
to dislodge mucous

18:50.760 --> 18:51.920
when it gathers in the lungs.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.673
I didn't agree to this.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.195
Think of it as a return
on your pocket money.

18:56.520 --> 19:00.798
You may also supplement this treatment
with what we call "percussion".

19:06.720 --> 19:07.720
Well, Mr Jeffries,

19:08.360 --> 19:12.148
the bronchodilator has increased
airflow to your lungs by 20%.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.671
I'd say that was worth coming in for.

19:19.360 --> 19:20.475
Let's try again.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.753
This little lady grows hungry.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.508
I've tried. She doesn't want me.

19:26.320 --> 19:29.676
Perseverance with a little help
from Mrs Grin-And-Bear-It.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.433
I want her on the bottle.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.256
That way I'll know
when she's had enough.

19:33.280 --> 19:34.315
Try again, dear.

19:35.160 --> 19:37.674
Baby will grow so much stronger
from what you can give her.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.896
My mother swore
she could tell which babies

19:39.920 --> 19:41.592
fed at the breast
and which at the bottle.

19:42.360 --> 19:44.590
Might I trouble you
for a cup of tea, Mr Dawley?

19:48.800 --> 19:52.076
Babies aren't an exact science.
A mother must trust her instinct.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.711
Then I should like her on the bottle.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.440
That way my husband
could help with feeding.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.152
She settles so much better with him.

20:03.280 --> 20:04.713
Would you take her, please?

20:07.560 --> 20:09.198
Hmm. Ah.

20:20.960 --> 20:25.556
Mr Phillips, I want you to reconsider
radiotherapy for your cancer.

20:26.240 --> 20:29.471
Your consultant at the London
offered you it, and you've refused.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.029
Will it cure me, Doc?

20:31.680 --> 20:33.875
It will improve
the quality of your time.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.750
And there's every chance
it will extend it.

20:38.880 --> 20:42.953
Frank, you have a wife, young children.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.676
Jane's young enough
to find someone else.

20:49.600 --> 20:53.275
I won't leave my kids memories
of a sick man, getting sicker.

20:53.760 --> 20:56.354
Your time will be better
with treatment.

20:56.680 --> 20:59.399
I thought you asked me here
to give me a cure for this

21:00.160 --> 21:02.040
cancer in my lungs,
something to make it better.

21:03.280 --> 21:06.238
Hope, Frank. It's the best thing of all.

21:07.360 --> 21:08.759
Says the man who's not dying.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.953
I've made my peace.

21:12.120 --> 21:13.155
Dr Turner.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.870
You make a very handsome butler.

21:56.680 --> 22:00.309
I make a very handsome 'haberdasherer'.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.234
No, not the shop, Fred.

22:02.760 --> 22:04.480
You wouldn't have
a clue about haberdashery.

22:04.840 --> 22:07.752
We are a nation of shopkeepers,
Mrs Buckle.

22:07.880 --> 22:08.915
It's in our blood.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.434
- But you...
- No, the matter is closed.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.310
Hello, ladies.
Yes, your eyes do not deceive you.

22:32.520 --> 22:35.398
It is I, Fred Buckle,
of the Buckle Establishment.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
And Mrs Buckle?

22:37.320 --> 22:38.958
Attending to other business.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.793
Now, how may I be of service?

22:42.320 --> 22:44.276
- I've a fitting.
- Smashing.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.480
Remind me of what kind of fitting.

22:47.160 --> 22:48.275
Brassier...

22:52.840 --> 22:53.880
I'm here for my monthlies.

22:54.320 --> 22:55.389
Monthly what?

23:01.480 --> 23:02.799
Hmm, ah.

23:04.520 --> 23:06.158
Hmm, one moment, ladies.

23:25.640 --> 23:28.996
Fred, I've only got a half day off.
I go on my rounds later.

23:29.080 --> 23:31.196
- Half day's perfect, don't apologise.
- I'm not.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.037
This is Miss Gilbert, my assistant.

23:34.560 --> 23:37.950
She'll be attending to
your more, er, personal needs.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.470
I'm on buttons, zips and collars.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.631
- Assistant?
- A very senior one.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.317
If you choose this fabric, you can have
a dress exactly like your mother's.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.513
Two peas in a pod.

24:21.360 --> 24:24.238
Mrs Dawley, my goodness,
you should be resting at home.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.951
I wanted to come
for the cover for the pram.

24:27.480 --> 24:29.675
My husband had one put by,
one in pink and one in blue

24:29.760 --> 24:30.760
for which ever we had.

24:31.160 --> 24:33.720
Of course, as long as you promise
to go straight home.

24:36.120 --> 24:37.712
Put your feet up long as you can.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.716
You won't get another holiday
from mothering, dear.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.558
We heard about you, Mrs Dawley.

24:46.760 --> 24:48.876
Takes some guts to manage how you did.

24:49.640 --> 24:51.073
It's worth it, though.

24:51.560 --> 24:55.712
Cos one day, you'll be standing
in this shop, proud as I am today,

24:56.040 --> 24:58.508
and you'll look at your little girl
and you'll see yourself.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.196
You'll show her the way, Mrs Dawley.

25:07.120 --> 25:09.031
How is baby, Mrs Dawley?

25:10.920 --> 25:11.955
She's perfect, Miss.

25:12.880 --> 25:14.677
Well, she'll look it in this.

25:15.520 --> 25:18.910
Now, home please, Mrs Dawley.
Your husband has settled already.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.349
Bye-bye.

25:32.640 --> 25:35.154
I've had a telephone call
from James McCadden.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.872
He's carrying out a post-mortem
at the chest hospital today

25:39.040 --> 25:40.880
and thought I might be
interested in attending.

25:41.080 --> 25:43.594
Gosh, James knows how
to show a chap a nice time.

25:44.120 --> 25:47.078
He always was a little macabre,
even when we studied together.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.793
But he knows about our clinic
and thought it might be educational.

25:51.720 --> 25:53.119
You're welcome to join us.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.639
It's very kind, but, on this occasion,
I'll politely decline.

25:59.360 --> 26:01.157
You're more than welcome, Mrs Marley.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.438
What a team, eh, Nurse Gilbert?

26:03.520 --> 26:05.715
We're like a well-oiled machine.

26:05.880 --> 26:07.871
I was thinking more Laurel and Hardy.

26:08.440 --> 26:10.795
Ah, I don't suppose
you're available tomorrow?

26:11.280 --> 26:13.032
- No.
- How 'bout lunch hour?

26:13.120 --> 26:14.120
No.

26:16.320 --> 26:17.594
Mrs Dawley.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.152
You still get queasy, Pat?

26:28.480 --> 26:30.198
I don't know what you mean, James.

26:31.240 --> 26:33.595
The coronary arteries were blocked.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.040
And he had lung cancer?

26:41.200 --> 26:44.317
Good God.
I've only seen them in textbooks.

26:46.720 --> 26:49.075
Tar and tumours.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.231
From those bloody cigarettes.

26:53.800 --> 26:55.153
He was 45.

26:56.040 --> 26:57.917
Smoked since he was 15, by all accounts.

26:58.040 --> 27:01.237
So, you may want to tell
the patients in your clinic

27:01.640 --> 27:04.871
no bronchodilator or drainage
technique will clear this up.

27:16.640 --> 27:17.789
Oh!

27:19.720 --> 27:21.039
I went back, but she'd gone.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.870
Then you should have telephoned
the police, Mrs Dawley.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.958
I knew she'd be safe.

27:34.640 --> 27:38.952
The people in the shop,
they were so kind, so full of goodness.

27:40.280 --> 27:42.635
You make it sound as though
leaving baby were a choice.

27:42.720 --> 27:43.755
Hello?

27:46.960 --> 27:48.916
They're a sight, aren't they,
Nurse Crane?

27:49.200 --> 27:50.758
My two beautiful girls.

27:51.240 --> 27:53.993
They are indeed, Mr Dawley.
You must be very proud.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.393
Might you settle her down for us?

28:04.240 --> 28:07.038
You shan't say anything
to Dennis, shall ya?

28:08.000 --> 28:11.709
I must ask you, Mrs Dawley,
are you frightened of your husband?

28:13.240 --> 28:14.639
Dennis is a gentleman.

28:16.520 --> 28:17.919
He treats me like a princess.

28:20.120 --> 28:21.917
This was his mother's house.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.960
He said no other woman would ever
live here, and then he met me.

28:27.280 --> 28:30.352
And he lets me live here
like the lady of the house. Me.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.631
You are the lady of the house.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.559
Tell me what happened today.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.918
I got muddled.

28:44.360 --> 28:46.999
Forgot myself.
I never meant to put her at harm.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.233
I want the best for her, Nurse.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.955
Having a baby is a terrific upheaval.

28:53.760 --> 28:58.197
Stop. Think only of yourself
and your little girl.

28:59.520 --> 29:00.839
And be patient.

29:01.560 --> 29:03.640
You've the rest of
your life to get the hang of this.

29:06.640 --> 29:11.031
Mrs Dawley, is there anyone,
a close friend or a female relative,

29:11.120 --> 29:13.588
who could come and visit
until you feel more settled?

29:13.760 --> 29:16.228
Yes, but is it necessary?

29:19.680 --> 29:20.960
I shall see you again, tomorrow.

29:25.240 --> 29:27.834
It's about presence and keeping calm,
and, yes, it was busy.

29:29.520 --> 29:32.159
Non-stop to tell the truth,
but I thought to myself,

29:32.240 --> 29:34.708
"Fred, you may be sailing
this ship alone,"

29:34.800 --> 29:37.997
"but you're sailing it for Vi
and we must weather the storm."

29:38.960 --> 29:40.359
My hero.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.877
Would you help me down to
the shop tomorrow?

29:44.960 --> 29:46.473
I've got to put my stock order in.

29:46.680 --> 29:49.752
Of course, my love
and I'll fetch your overcoats,

29:51.200 --> 29:53.430
because hell will freeze over first.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
You are resting.

29:55.640 --> 29:58.871
Anything needs doing,
you let your hubby-dasherer do it.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.232
Well, it's got to be done first thing.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.398
It's all in the book by the till.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.158
"Hubby-dasherer". Hmm.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.996
I worry that the traumatic birth
has put Mrs Dawley

30:12.080 --> 30:13.752
in a peculiar way of thinking.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.993
There was something
rather lost about her in the shop.

30:17.080 --> 30:21.073
A sort of sadness, as if she would have
preferred to stay in there with us.

30:22.360 --> 30:24.078
Could it be a touch of the baby blues?

30:24.680 --> 30:27.797
She's yet to forge a link with baby.
That much is apparent.

30:28.480 --> 30:31.040
I don't think Mrs Dawley
ever fully believed she was pregnant.

30:32.280 --> 30:33.633
I'll keep a weather eye on her.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.950
You think we might try
gathering a little pace?

30:39.280 --> 30:41.680
I should like to devote what's
left of my evening to Spanish.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.279
What in God's name are you doing?

30:59.800 --> 31:01.916
- Nothing.
- Don't give me, "Nothing".

31:02.840 --> 31:04.193
The damn thing's still alight.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.149
You're smoking?

31:08.520 --> 31:11.637
My son, my 14-year-old son is smoking.

31:12.160 --> 31:13.896
Kenneth Parker smokes,
he's six weeks younger than me.

31:13.920 --> 31:15.512
You are on thin ice.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.751
If I ever catch you
with a cigarette again...

31:17.840 --> 31:19.910
You'll what? Light it for me?

31:20.040 --> 31:21.871
- While you are under this roof...
- Patrick.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.155
Go on, Dad.
Tell me why I shouldn't smoke.

31:25.280 --> 31:27.360
You said yourself,
cancer's just a school of thought.

31:27.880 --> 31:29.360
If you don't care, then why should I?

31:36.880 --> 31:39.189
There, that's better, isn't it,
my little one?

31:41.520 --> 31:42.555
Hello, my love.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.550
What do you think,
the pink or the white?

31:49.840 --> 31:52.912
- She's so perfect, isn't she?
- Because she's from you.

31:55.440 --> 31:58.557
- Why can't you see what I see?
- Cos you don't see what's real.

31:59.200 --> 32:01.236
Trust in the Lord with all thine heart,

32:01.960 --> 32:03.951
and lean not unto
thine own understanding.

32:04.040 --> 32:05.951
- I'm not real.
- You are to me.

32:07.080 --> 32:08.638
You will be to our daughter.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.158
All she will ever know of you is this.

32:12.040 --> 32:15.077
That's what's real.
That's what's perfect.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.589
The pink or the white?

32:25.720 --> 32:27.199
Whichever you think best.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.759
He'll come around.
He just needs to cool off.

33:00.320 --> 33:01.548
I'm giving up.

33:02.840 --> 33:04.280
Do you hear me, Tim? I am giving up.

33:05.040 --> 33:06.109
Do you promise?

33:06.600 --> 33:10.309
Yes. With all my heart.

33:12.440 --> 33:15.273
So, I never want to see
you with a cigarette again.

33:16.200 --> 33:17.394
Now, you promise me, Tim.

33:17.880 --> 33:19.720
Put your hand on your heart
and you promise me.

33:20.480 --> 33:21.515
I promise.

33:25.080 --> 33:26.957
You are my only son.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.792
My only son and I never,
ever want to lose you.

33:39.200 --> 33:41.998
Would you rather I were here today?
I could put off the meeting.

33:42.640 --> 33:44.073
Please, go to your meeting.

33:46.400 --> 33:49.790
You don't seem yourself, Roseanne.
You haven't since her birth.

33:50.040 --> 33:51.473
I am, Dennis.

33:52.760 --> 33:54.113
I'm quite myself.

33:56.240 --> 33:58.240
I shall be no different
whether you're here or not.

34:04.280 --> 34:05.776
Have you thought any more
about her name?

34:05.800 --> 34:07.000
I don't have your imagination.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.279
We'll find one.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.199
When we know her better.

34:14.159 --> 34:16.116
One that captures the sense of her.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.757
You'll think of one that fits her best.

34:55.040 --> 34:57.110
It's the only way, clean break.

34:57.800 --> 34:59.358
Well done. I'm proud of you.

34:59.520 --> 35:03.274
Exactly. If we're giving up,
we simply have to bite the bullet.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.838
"We"? I thought you were giving up.

35:07.240 --> 35:10.357
Both of us. I promised Tim this morning.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.870
But I smoke so little.
It surely can't matter.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.672
- One or two a day.
- Shelagh, they're coffin nails.

35:17.280 --> 35:18.759
Lethal, every one of them.

35:20.960 --> 35:22.552
Keep Freddie at your side.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.590
Every time you think
of taking a cigarette,

35:25.680 --> 35:27.040
do something else with your hands.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.515
I fear there may be
quite a lot of frogs, Patrick.

35:31.320 --> 35:34.312
Would you bring me Mr Phillips' notes,
when you have a moment?

35:47.680 --> 35:48.795
Hello, any one at home?

36:06.800 --> 36:09.314
Oh, there, there.

36:16.320 --> 36:18.072
What's this?

36:20.000 --> 36:22.036
"Can't make baby safe."

36:22.520 --> 36:24.078
"Please forgive me."

36:25.720 --> 36:28.951
Oh, don't you fret.
We'll find your mummy.

36:30.360 --> 36:31.429
Yes.

36:33.240 --> 36:35.071
But there must be something you can do.

36:36.280 --> 36:38.271
I'm only a couple of hours late.

36:38.520 --> 36:40.397
<i>Our order's always on time.</i>

36:40.520 --> 36:44.638
Yeah, I know Mrs Buckle is never late
with her order, but I'm not Mrs Buckle.

36:44.840 --> 36:46.120
<i>Sorry, there's nothing I can do.</i>

36:46.240 --> 36:49.277
Look,
I'm begging you for a favour.

36:49.440 --> 36:50.793
<i>I don't have time.</i>

36:50.880 --> 36:52.950
Hello. Hello?

37:00.760 --> 37:03.035
I used to visit
the Blue Angel Jazz Club.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.800
Did you work there, Mr Phillips?

37:05.000 --> 37:08.629
I was the brawn on the door.
Took the punches, threw a few, too.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.357
I don't believe you've no fight left.

37:11.760 --> 37:13.040
Not here for the pictures, then?

37:13.320 --> 37:17.871
When it comes to it, you will beg
for one extra minute with your family.

37:18.640 --> 37:22.235
Trust me. Please take the radiotherapy.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.190
You can call me at any time.

37:30.520 --> 37:33.159
Hello, Dr Turner. What you doing here?

37:33.520 --> 37:36.830
He just dropped in to tell me
to give up the fags.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.558
- Hello, Mrs Phillips.
- Could it help him?

37:41.520 --> 37:44.671
- Could it give him a bit more time?
- No, no, no. Not now, Jane.

37:47.160 --> 37:49.594
I expect you'd like some tea.
Hold her for me, Frank.

37:53.040 --> 37:55.998
You haven't told her, have you,
that you have a choice?

37:56.080 --> 37:58.435
It ain't her choice. I'm dying.

37:58.520 --> 38:02.308
You could live longer and better.
That is a choice.

38:02.720 --> 38:04.278
She used to call me her movie star.

38:06.480 --> 38:09.517
But the real ones in the club,
she never looked twice at them.

38:09.680 --> 38:13.468
That's how I want her to remember me.
I want my kids, too.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.078
And what about what they want?

38:26.720 --> 38:28.920
Well, hello, Nurse Crane.
I wasn't expecting to see you.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.440
Where's Roseanne?

38:36.680 --> 38:38.511
Mr Dawley,
if we put our heads together...

38:38.680 --> 38:40.480
Nurse Crane,
your concern is most appreciated,

38:40.640 --> 38:42.198
but there's really no need for it.

38:42.840 --> 38:44.400
My wife will have gone to her mother's.

38:45.320 --> 38:48.153
Yes, now I think of it,
she mentioned she might visit.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.109
Where is her mother?

38:50.840 --> 38:51.840
The Isle of Dogs.

38:53.360 --> 38:55.078
It would be better
if her mother came here.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.480
Is it something that comes
to all mothers?

39:00.600 --> 39:03.239
That sacred bond
between mother and child.

39:04.240 --> 39:08.233
I have no doubts, I only fear she does.

39:09.480 --> 39:10.993
Hard work makes a mother.

39:12.360 --> 39:15.830
We like to think something magical
happens at birth, and for some it does.

39:17.480 --> 39:22.679
But the real magic is keeping on
when all you want to do is run.

39:25.040 --> 39:26.840
Do you have children
of your own, Nurse Crane?

39:27.400 --> 39:29.391
That wasn't a path set out for me.

39:30.800 --> 39:34.509
The Lord gives us what we need,
not always what we want.

39:35.160 --> 39:37.515
I tend not to rely on the Lord,
Mr Dawley.

39:38.040 --> 39:41.271
Will you telephone me as soon as
your wife gets back from her mother's?

39:59.520 --> 40:01.397
Might I beg a favour, Mrs Turner?

40:01.720 --> 40:04.359
- Of course.
- Mrs Roseanne Dawley.

40:04.840 --> 40:07.877
Oh, yes. How...
How are was she and baby?

40:08.480 --> 40:11.597
She's upped and left what,
by all accounts, looks a perfect life.

40:12.200 --> 40:13.680
Would you have a glance at her notes,

40:13.720 --> 40:16.393
see if there's anything
that may indicate any difficulties.

40:17.080 --> 40:18.354
Certainly, Nurse Crane.

40:19.160 --> 40:21.520
I'm worried she may have got
herself into a bit of a pickle.

40:23.360 --> 40:25.920
- She registered two years ago.
- Mmm-hmm.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.954
First visit was to confirm pregnancy.

40:30.200 --> 40:33.397
Previous notes? Could they be
under her maiden name, Lakey?

40:35.680 --> 40:37.557
Oh, there's nothing
for a Roseanne Lakey.

40:38.920 --> 40:40.751
They must still be
with her previous doctor.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.719
Find them for me, Mrs Turner.
Quick as you like, please.

40:43.880 --> 40:45.199
Should you telephone the police?

40:45.640 --> 40:46.920
I think perhaps I shall have to.

41:04.120 --> 41:05.269
Roseanne?

41:07.880 --> 41:09.074
Roseanne?

41:11.360 --> 41:13.669
- I'm so sorry. Please excuse me.
- Come on.

41:31.400 --> 41:33.550
- Rosie Lakey.
- All right, Nel.

41:36.440 --> 41:38.874
- I didn't know where else to go.
- What is it, girl?

41:41.440 --> 41:44.193
Did he give you an hiding?
He never looked that type.

41:44.400 --> 41:47.233
No, no.
Dennis ain't laid a finger on me.

41:55.800 --> 41:58.075
Rosie, this don't make no sense to me.

41:59.520 --> 42:00.794
What are you doing here?

42:03.800 --> 42:05.199
It's different now.

42:05.360 --> 42:07.590
How, when he don't lump you
or treat you bad?

42:08.400 --> 42:10.800
- Why you walking out on him?
- Cos I need to be good enough.

42:12.320 --> 42:16.108
So very, very good
for that life now, and I ain't.

42:18.240 --> 42:19.753
It's a charmed life you been living

42:19.840 --> 42:21.990
if you got time
for thoughts like that, I tell you.

42:23.400 --> 42:24.515
Can I stay, Nel?

42:29.560 --> 42:32.597
You can always stay.
Didn't I promise you that?

42:34.880 --> 42:39.158
I managed to track down Mrs Dawley's
medical records at her previous surgery

42:39.240 --> 42:40.593
from before her marriage.

42:40.720 --> 42:42.200
I don't know why we didn't have them.

42:42.640 --> 42:44.198
And, am I right to be worried?

42:44.400 --> 42:45.992
Yes, I think perhaps you are.

42:46.680 --> 42:50.593
You said she'd gone to her mother's,
but the notes show Roseanne contracted

42:50.760 --> 42:53.991
several childhood illnesses
from the Newman Home for Girls.

42:54.960 --> 42:56.837
A home for orphans
and abandoned children.

42:58.280 --> 43:00.191
So, we can take
her mother out of the equation?

43:00.600 --> 43:02.318
There were another set of notes.

43:03.240 --> 43:05.754
Roseanne was seen by a prison doctor.

43:06.400 --> 43:08.231
She was in Holloway for soliciting.

43:14.120 --> 43:16.236
So, what now?
Back on the game, that the plan?

43:18.000 --> 43:20.195
I do what I do to feed my kids.

43:21.200 --> 43:24.158
- You think I'd do it if I had a choice?
- It's what I know.

43:25.360 --> 43:26.800
You never believed in luck, did you?

43:27.880 --> 43:29.320
I don't want her growing up like me.

43:29.640 --> 43:31.120
You think I'll have that for my Cath?

43:35.480 --> 43:37.072
Nel, I didn't mean it of you.

43:37.600 --> 43:39.352
I'd die before she goes
on those streets.

43:40.120 --> 43:44.272
I take those men, those filthy sods
and I save every shilling.

43:45.200 --> 43:49.193
Cos my girl's gonna have a better life.
She's gonna be proper.

43:51.320 --> 43:53.072
I ain't got your strength, Nel.

43:54.880 --> 43:56.438
I go back to what I am.

44:07.480 --> 44:09.948
You forgot, didn't you?
My order?

44:11.360 --> 44:13.954
I tried. I tried so hard.

44:15.160 --> 44:16.388
I'm no good, Vi.

44:17.440 --> 44:19.431
I'm just a chump who's let you down.

44:23.920 --> 44:27.799
I'll talk to 'em. I'll tell 'em
that I messed everything up.

44:28.840 --> 44:29.989
Out my shop, Fred.

44:31.680 --> 44:32.908
Now, please.

44:43.120 --> 44:45.714
Oh, thank God you're back.
Have you got my order?

44:45.920 --> 44:48.753
Orders will be late this week,
but we'll do our best to get them in.

44:48.880 --> 44:50.154
You have my word on that.

44:50.240 --> 44:52.000
What was you thinking,
leaving him in charge?

44:52.040 --> 44:53.871
He ran himself ragged
getting nowhere fast.

44:54.520 --> 44:56.560
I thought you'd know that already
about Fred Buckle.

44:56.720 --> 44:59.109
He offers you the world,
and gives you Chrisp Street.

44:59.720 --> 45:01.836
I mean to say, he tried,

45:02.040 --> 45:04.395
but you can't run a shop
on good intentions, can you?

45:04.960 --> 45:07.110
Don't he know this shop's
the only thing you've got?

45:09.960 --> 45:12.474
It's not all I have, Mrs Cadmen,

45:12.960 --> 45:15.838
but it is mine,
and I would like you to leave it.

45:17.040 --> 45:18.951
<i>Tout de suite,</i> as my Fred would say.

45:21.840 --> 45:24.718
By the way,
I'm very fond of Chrisp Street.

45:46.440 --> 45:48.431
All right, Turner, let's get this over.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.036
The research indicates that lung cancer

45:52.120 --> 45:54.680
is increasingly common
in patients over 45.

45:54.760 --> 45:55.954
- Tea?
- No.

45:56.120 --> 45:58.350
Who may present
with little or no symptoms.

45:58.720 --> 46:00.153
Then it's a wild goose chase?

46:00.880 --> 46:04.395
An impressive challenge we have neither
the resource nor stomach for.

46:04.560 --> 46:06.073
Good God, just the cost of it!

46:06.400 --> 46:09.080
The cost is a lot less than treating
lung cancer in its late stages.

46:10.640 --> 46:11.914
It's very simple, Mr Stephens.

46:12.640 --> 46:15.279
I don't want to see lung cancer
as the biggest cause of death

46:15.360 --> 46:16.952
in Poplar in five years' time.

46:17.720 --> 46:20.632
- We gave you your chest clinic.
- For one morning.

46:21.640 --> 46:25.235
I am talking about a clinic
twice a month for a whole day.

46:25.400 --> 46:26.628
In a larger premises.

46:28.880 --> 46:30.996
My surgery can't meet the demand.

46:31.320 --> 46:33.356
I'm not simply talking
about lung cancer,

46:33.480 --> 46:36.472
but emphysema, bronchitis, pleurisy.

46:37.160 --> 46:39.628
The chronic manifestations
of all of these

46:39.720 --> 46:42.393
could be partially managed by me,
at the clinic.

46:42.920 --> 46:45.070
And who would tend
to your clinic in that time?

46:46.520 --> 46:48.909
I was coming to the subject of a locum.

46:50.280 --> 46:53.477
Why is it that every time you come
in here I get a headache?

46:56.240 --> 46:59.073
Must be the air. I get one too.

47:00.200 --> 47:01.394
Put it out, Jim.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.991
You know people are calling them
"coffin nails".

47:08.640 --> 47:11.518
One clinic, once a month, half a day.

47:15.040 --> 47:16.320
I'll send someone straight away.

47:17.560 --> 47:19.516
Nurse Crane, we've had a telephone call.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.831
A Mrs Tanner asks to go to her.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.070
She's in Limehouse,
in the St Saviour's building.

47:24.880 --> 47:26.199
Mrs Dawley's with her.

47:27.840 --> 47:29.068
Thank you, Sister Winifred.

47:29.760 --> 47:31.557
Oh, I hope the poor woman's all right.

47:31.960 --> 47:34.633
I couldn't help over-hearing
your conversation with Mrs Turner.

47:35.040 --> 47:37.440
Prostitution leaves many scars.
I've seen that at first hand.

47:40.160 --> 47:42.754
Would you come with me, to St Saviour's?

47:43.720 --> 47:45.790
I think Mrs Dawley
might find you a comfort.

47:47.160 --> 47:48.434
I'll get my coat.

47:52.880 --> 47:57.795
"You, you alone will have
the stars as no-one else has them."

47:58.680 --> 48:01.433
"On one of the stars, I shall be living."

48:02.440 --> 48:04.510
"On one of them, I shall be laughing."

48:05.560 --> 48:08.916
<i>"And so it will be,
as if all the stars were laughing,"</i>

48:09.600 --> 48:11.431
<i>"when you look at the sky at night."</i>

48:12.720 --> 48:16.918
<i>"You, only you,
will have stars that can laugh."</i>

48:44.480 --> 48:46.198
All I wanted was to be old enough

48:49.040 --> 48:50.598
to leave.

48:53.640 --> 48:55.915
There weren't no kindness
in the Newman Home.

48:57.760 --> 48:59.432
If there was an opposite to kindness,

49:00.960 --> 49:02.188
it was in that place.

49:03.520 --> 49:05.272
No-one there who was just for me.

49:09.880 --> 49:11.393
I dreamed God was my dad.

49:13.760 --> 49:15.478
Cos of what the Bible says.

49:17.440 --> 49:18.759
God, the Father.

49:21.240 --> 49:22.593
So, I'd go to church.

49:24.720 --> 49:26.438
Pray to Him for a miracle.

49:27.800 --> 49:29.153
To be loved.

49:31.600 --> 49:33.033
And then I met Dennis.

49:36.080 --> 49:37.433
My miracle.

49:39.400 --> 49:41.960
My kind, wonderful miracle.

49:46.120 --> 49:48.315
He brought frankincense to the church.

49:52.080 --> 49:55.550
They call it,
"Perfume of the Sanctuary".

49:57.600 --> 49:59.079
It was sanctuary.

50:00.520 --> 50:03.239
- You say that as if it were past.
- It was never meant for me.

50:06.280 --> 50:08.077
The Newman Home was meant for me.

50:09.760 --> 50:11.296
Me and all the girls who weren't wanted.

50:11.320 --> 50:15.313
The girls that couldn't be kept.
It's not the same.

50:15.480 --> 50:18.320
It is when you're six and you finally
know that no-one's coming for you.

50:21.640 --> 50:27.715
Dennis looks at me,
and he don't see what they all saw.

50:29.560 --> 50:32.552
Them grown-ups who'd come to
the home and look straight through me.

50:33.480 --> 50:37.917
It's a wretched start and there
was nothing you could do about it.

50:39.760 --> 50:43.036
We don't choose to be unloved
by those who should love us.

50:45.160 --> 50:48.391
You didn't choose
to be abandoned, Roseanne.

50:50.120 --> 50:52.873
But you did choose to go to your church,

50:54.320 --> 50:55.958
to talk with Mr Dawley.

50:56.600 --> 50:59.478
Look what happened
when you began to choose.

50:59.560 --> 51:04.793
How can I show my baby the right path
when I never took it myself?

51:06.880 --> 51:08.996
I ain't fit to raise that child.

51:09.960 --> 51:11.757
You are.

51:16.800 --> 51:18.631
My mother's parents threw her out.

51:20.360 --> 51:23.557
She did anything she could to feed me,

51:24.040 --> 51:25.632
to try and get me shoes to wear.

51:26.960 --> 51:28.712
I didn't see how that broke her.

51:30.840 --> 51:33.400
But I wish, oh, I wish so much
she'd be here now,

51:34.080 --> 51:39.552
so I could put my arms around her,
tell her she's good, and strong,

51:40.360 --> 51:41.998
and the bravest woman I ever knew.

51:45.160 --> 51:48.357
Shame will keep us
in all kinds of prisons if we let it,

51:50.200 --> 51:54.830
and it will keep us from
those we love and who love us.

51:58.160 --> 52:00.674
Your little girl wants you.

52:03.040 --> 52:05.838
Don't abandon her
because you were abandoned.

52:20.160 --> 52:22.993
Mr Phillips, how can I help?

52:23.640 --> 52:27.235
Get me into the London, Doc,
fast as you like.

52:27.960 --> 52:30.554
I will beg, borrow and steal
every minute I can get.

52:31.680 --> 52:34.399
We'll take you in as soon as we can.

52:35.880 --> 52:37.233
Thank you, Doc.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.433
Making me see sense.

53:03.480 --> 53:05.311
Let's get her settled upstairs,
Mr Dawley.

53:13.840 --> 53:15.432
There we are, that's the ticket.

53:16.760 --> 53:18.751
Look how well she's taken.

53:19.760 --> 53:21.273
I think that's a smile.

53:22.520 --> 53:24.397
- Dennis, she's smiling at me.
- I...

53:26.560 --> 53:28.516
It does indeed look very like a smile.

53:31.200 --> 53:32.599
I have a name for her.

53:33.520 --> 53:37.195
It's come to me,
like you said it would.

53:39.880 --> 53:41.199
Faith.

53:42.200 --> 53:46.591
After you,
for seeing in me what I couldn't.

53:49.960 --> 53:52.554
Faith. Always.

54:00.040 --> 54:01.917
I love our Faith.

54:02.640 --> 54:04.073
See, she doesn't stir.

54:05.520 --> 54:07.192
She knows she's safe.

54:07.960 --> 54:09.154
She knows she's loved.

54:16.640 --> 54:18.153
Oh, ow!

54:22.080 --> 54:23.195
Fred!

54:27.200 --> 54:31.239
You may be a chump,
but you're my chump.

54:33.160 --> 54:34.991
I don't care about the shop.

54:35.920 --> 54:37.672
It's what I had
when I didn't have anyone.

54:39.560 --> 54:42.518
Look at us. We've met so late.

54:43.320 --> 54:45.390
We haven't brought up
little'uns together,

54:45.560 --> 54:48.279
or huddled for warmth when
we couldn't afford to pay for the gas.

54:48.360 --> 54:50.999
None of them things
that bring folks close.

54:52.760 --> 54:55.115
But you did all you could
when I needed you.

54:57.440 --> 54:59.112
I wish we'd met earlier.

55:00.080 --> 55:01.638
I wish we had more time together.

55:04.680 --> 55:06.591
- Promise me one thing.
- Anything.

55:07.400 --> 55:10.756
You are never setting foot
in my shop again, Fred.

55:15.000 --> 55:18.231
Oh! Not too tight.

55:22.600 --> 55:25.034
Did you hear, Dad's got the clinic?

55:25.440 --> 55:26.953
I knew you'd do it.

55:27.280 --> 55:29.794
- Did you try my psychological approach?
- Yes.

55:30.520 --> 55:33.717
As you suggested,
I asked for double what I needed,

55:34.080 --> 55:35.957
ended up with half,
which is what I wanted.

55:36.520 --> 55:39.318
Psychology, Tim?
This is all rather new, isn't it?

55:39.800 --> 55:41.552
I've been reading up on it for years,

55:41.760 --> 55:43.480
preparing myself
for the great game of life.

55:44.280 --> 55:46.040
Sometimes for people
to make the right choice

55:46.160 --> 55:47.832
you must first show
them the worst choice.

55:52.600 --> 55:54.272
You never actually smoked, did you?

55:55.640 --> 55:58.552
Hey, Sis, they're going to be
around for a long time to come.

55:58.680 --> 56:00.033
Isn't that the best news?

56:00.200 --> 56:03.317
The rate I'm eating biscuits,
I shall be needing a new dress.

56:03.920 --> 56:06.229
I've a good mind to take it out
of your pocket money, too.

56:06.840 --> 56:09.832
You can both have every shilling I have.
You're my world.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.834
I don't know what kind
of a man I'm gonna be.

56:33.400 --> 56:36.949
After the radium, I don't want
to be a greater burden on you.

56:37.640 --> 56:38.959
Oh, Frank.

56:40.360 --> 56:42.874
Can't you see I'd take
every burden in this world

56:43.360 --> 56:44.952
for every day we have with you?

56:49.400 --> 56:51.152
<i>Moments and hours,</i>

56:51.320 --> 56:55.233
<i>shillings and pounds,
calculations and graphs.</i>

56:55.920 --> 56:59.356
<i>No matter how complex
or how comprehensive,</i>

56:59.880 --> 57:03.634
<i>figures tell only a fraction
of the stories of our lives.</i>

57:04.560 --> 57:10.112
<i>In its simplest form, one plus one
has always equalled more than two.</i>

57:11.240 --> 57:12.912
<i>It makes a whole.</i>

57:14.480 --> 57:16.096
I heard this year's funds
wouldn't stretch to taking

57:16.120 --> 57:19.176
the old folks to the sea, so I thought
I'd bring a bit of the seaside to them.

57:19.200 --> 57:21.760
I think shorts are a very practical
choice for a camping holiday,

57:22.000 --> 57:23.718
and not amusing in any way, at all.

57:23.880 --> 57:26.474
I'm a bad mother, Sister,
and I was punished.

57:26.880 --> 57:28.400
Walking into doors
is never a good sign

57:28.920 --> 57:31.229
and getting them to tell
the truth is always difficult.

57:31.600 --> 57:32.874
Help me, please!

57:33.560 --> 57:35.949
<i>She looked as if
she'd been attacked by an animal.</i>

57:36.120 --> 57:37.951
Ladies' safety is at risk.

57:38.080 --> 57:40.355
I'm sorry, I know
you're only second on call,

57:40.800 --> 57:42.916
but something distinctly odd
has happened.
