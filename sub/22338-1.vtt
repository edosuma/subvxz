00:48.697 --> 00:49.948
Mr. St. Clairwants to see you.

00:51.280 --> 00:52.864
Really?

00:52.906 --> 00:54.530
That's what his assistant said.

00:54.572 --> 00:55.781
Now?

00:55.822 --> 00:57.322
I'm a mess.

00:57.364 --> 00:58.447
I think nowwould be good.

01:01.238 --> 01:02.155
Megan...

Hi!

01:13.280 --> 01:14.280
What are youdoing here?

01:15.447 --> 01:16.322
I had a deposition

01:16.364 --> 01:18.197
in the buildingacross the street.

01:18.239 --> 01:19.155
Oh...

01:19.197 --> 01:21.906
Carly, I coulduse some coffee.

01:23.948 --> 01:25.447
Sure.

01:25.447 --> 01:27.072
Thanks, Chloe.

01:28.072 --> 01:30.113
So...good surprise?

01:30.113 --> 01:31.781
Uh, of course, yeah.

01:31.781 --> 01:33.364
But right nowI have to go.

01:33.405 --> 01:34.822
Mr. St. Clair wants to see me.

01:34.864 --> 01:36.030
Do you thinkthat's a good thing?

01:36.072 --> 01:37.113
Why wouldn't it be?

01:37.113 --> 01:39.572
You are the queenof customer relations.

01:39.614 --> 01:40.447
Client relations.

01:40.447 --> 01:42.113
Right.

01:42.155 --> 01:44.238
I was actually hopingwe could talk.

01:44.280 --> 01:45.697
Talk?

01:45.739 --> 01:47.822
Yeah.About us?

01:47.864 --> 01:50.405
The where-are-we-goingconversation.

01:50.447 --> 01:51.781
Part...five.

01:51.781 --> 01:53.155
Yes, of coursewe can talk,

01:53.197 --> 01:55.614
but right now,I really have to go.

01:55.656 --> 01:57.614
Um, what about dinner?

01:57.656 --> 01:59.447
What aboutChameleons at 7:00?

01:59.489 --> 02:01.072
Perfect. Wish me luck.

02:01.948 --> 02:02.781

02:03.822 --> 02:05.697
[knocking]Mr. St. Clair?

02:05.739 --> 02:07.447
Ms. Quinn, come in.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.113
How can I help you?

02:12.155 --> 02:14.364
Please, have a seat.

02:15.197 --> 02:17.072
I have heardnothing but good things

02:17.113 --> 02:19.322
about your performancein Client Relations.

02:19.364 --> 02:21.155
Thank you.

02:21.197 --> 02:23.405
That's whyI wanted to see you.

02:23.447 --> 02:25.113
I've read your resume,

02:25.113 --> 02:27.072
and I see you've studiedarchitecture at Duke.

02:27.113 --> 02:28.781
Yes, I've wantedto design things

02:28.822 --> 02:30.322
ever since I was a little girl.

02:30.364 --> 02:33.113
Hmm, and yet you're stillin client relations.

02:33.155 --> 02:36.656
Well, I'm just waitingon my door to open.

02:36.697 --> 02:39.572
Why don't we seeif we can kick that door down?

02:41.781 --> 02:42.614
I don't follow.

02:42.656 --> 02:43.948
Well, due toa scheduling change,

02:43.989 --> 02:46.948
the Sapphire Lake projectis now slated to break ground

02:46.948 --> 02:49.030
in less than 30 days.

02:49.072 --> 02:50.197
Sapphire Lake?

02:50.238 --> 02:51.697
Oh, yes, of course,you wouldn't know about it.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.614
We are getting ready to builda new retail development

02:53.614 --> 02:54.530
at Sapphire Lake.

02:54.572 --> 02:57.030
However, I find myselfin a dilemma,

02:57.072 --> 02:58.656
thanks toa 60-something-year-old woman

02:58.697 --> 02:59.781
who refusesto sell us her property,

02:59.822 --> 03:00.906
land that is

03:00.948 --> 03:02.822
smack-dab in the centerof our new development.

03:02.864 --> 03:05.948
Now, I need someonewith people skills, Ms. Quinn,

03:05.948 --> 03:07.155
and that's whereyou come in.

03:07.197 --> 03:08.280
My assistant hasmentioned to me

03:08.322 --> 03:10.155
that you grew upnear Sapphire Lake?

03:10.197 --> 03:12.364
Yes. I've spenta lot of time there.

03:12.405 --> 03:14.155
It's one of my favorite places.

03:14.197 --> 03:15.197
Good. Come with me.

03:23.614 --> 03:25.155
Watch this.

03:26.447 --> 03:28.656
[video]: Welcome to Sapphire Lake,

03:28.697 --> 03:30.155

03:32.697 --> 03:35.614
relaxing small-town living meets the convenience...

03:35.656 --> 03:36.781
[man's voice]: I sure hope Mrs. Figgins

03:36.781 --> 03:38.364
never cuts down our tree.

03:39.614 --> 03:41.781
Maybe you shouldcheck the knothole.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.238
If I do, will youstop acting so weird?

03:44.280 --> 03:45.697
Maybe.

03:45.739 --> 03:46.989
[chuckles]

03:47.948 --> 03:49.113
Hey, you know I kept

03:49.155 --> 03:50.656
all those notes and lettersyou sent me, right?

03:50.697 --> 03:51.781
Megan, wait.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.322
Joe, do you want me to checkin the knothole or not?

03:56.364 --> 03:58.322
Yes.

03:58.364 --> 04:00.906
But first...

04:04.405 --> 04:05.322
Megan,

04:05.364 --> 04:07.364
we've known each otherour whole lives,

04:07.405 --> 04:12.031
from preschoolto high school graduation,

04:12.072 --> 04:14.322
but I don't want to talkabout the past.

04:14.364 --> 04:17.031
I want to talkabout the future.

04:17.072 --> 04:19.279
[voice echoes] The future.

04:19.279 --> 04:21.697
[video]: ...making waking up tomorrow

04:21.738 --> 04:22.906
better today.

04:22.948 --> 04:25.238
Voilà!

04:26.739 --> 04:27.822
Wow.

04:27.864 --> 04:29.572
I hardly recognize it.

04:29.614 --> 04:30.822
Impressive, isn't it?

04:30.864 --> 04:32.113
Yes, it is.

04:32.113 --> 04:34.280
Stick with me on this, Quinn.

04:41.405 --> 04:42.447
Mr. St. Clair,

04:42.489 --> 04:44.948
I'm not certain Sapphire Lakeis the best place

04:44.948 --> 04:46.614
for a development like that.

04:46.656 --> 04:48.656
Well, according toour market research, it is.

04:48.697 --> 04:50.572
However this woman,Frances Figgins,

04:50.614 --> 04:51.864
is holding upthe whole project.

04:51.906 --> 04:54.614
We need her parcel of land,and she refuses to sell.

04:54.614 --> 04:56.781
She's really the last obstaclein our way,

04:56.822 --> 04:59.072
and despite my best effortsto reason with her,

04:59.113 --> 05:00.072
she has now hung up on me--

05:00.113 --> 05:02.239
now, let me think...six times?

05:02.280 --> 05:03.405
Seven times, sir.

05:03.447 --> 05:05.781
Seven times.

05:05.781 --> 05:08.113
I'm not sure if you've beento Sapphire Lake,

05:08.113 --> 05:08.948
but it really is

05:08.989 --> 05:11.489
a very tranquiland, and--

05:11.530 --> 05:14.031
Let me stop youright there, Ms. Quinn.

05:14.072 --> 05:15.948
Would you like to getout of client relations

05:15.948 --> 05:17.447
and one day design

05:17.447 --> 05:19.280
a Stoneland Propertiesdevelopment?

05:19.322 --> 05:20.113
Of course.

05:20.155 --> 05:21.280
Then you needto learn

05:21.322 --> 05:22.781
that sentimentalityand business don't mix.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.197
Now, Sapphire Lakeis going to be

05:25.238 --> 05:26.656
our biggest development to date,

05:26.697 --> 05:28.489
and our CEO wants to make surethat everything goes smoothly.

05:28.530 --> 05:30.614
The very futureof this division

05:30.614 --> 05:31.614
depends on it.

05:31.656 --> 05:32.864
Now, it's been broughtto my attention

05:32.906 --> 05:34.530
that you are quitea people person,

05:34.572 --> 05:36.031
which is why I thinkyou're the best person

05:36.072 --> 05:37.614
to help usclose this deal.

05:37.614 --> 05:39.031
So, are you in?

05:43.948 --> 05:44.822
I'm in.

05:45.697 --> 05:47.113
Good.I'm counting on you.

05:47.113 --> 05:48.614
Is my car ready?

05:48.656 --> 05:49.614
Waitingfor you, sir.

05:49.614 --> 05:50.781
Wonderful.

05:50.781 --> 05:52.530
Now, you have to getMrs. Figgins to agree to sell

05:52.572 --> 05:54.280
before we're forced to paythe contractors a penalty.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.906
If that happens,

05:55.948 --> 05:58.364
the board of directorswill pull the plug,

05:58.405 --> 06:00.031
and let me assure you,Ms. Quinn,

06:00.072 --> 06:01.405
that will notbe a good thing.

06:01.447 --> 06:02.572
Not for any of us.

06:02.614 --> 06:03.572
Now, you've got till Monday

06:03.614 --> 06:04.739
at 10:00 a.m.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.031
to close the deal.

06:06.072 --> 06:07.739
You do that,and I'll personally see to it

06:07.781 --> 06:09.989
that you get a shotat your dream.

06:11.656 --> 06:12.614
I'm sorry,

06:12.656 --> 06:15.322
did you say, uh,Monday morning?

06:15.364 --> 06:17.572
As in four days from now?

06:17.614 --> 06:18.530
That's right.

06:18.572 --> 06:19.864
We're all counting on you.

06:19.906 --> 06:21.155
Don't let us down.

06:27.864 --> 06:30.530
[♪♪]

06:34.364 --> 06:36.614
So, I guess youhaven't seen it?

06:36.656 --> 06:38.697

06:38.739 --> 06:42.031
The latest editionof Chicago Attorney.

06:42.072 --> 06:42.864
[chuckles]

06:42.906 --> 06:43.697
No, I haven't.

06:43.739 --> 06:45.864
I dog-eared the page.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.280
"Meet Chicago's

06:56.530 --> 06:57.864
Wow, Philip,

06:57.906 --> 06:59.113
this is amazing.

06:59.155 --> 07:00.697
I love that they usedmy full name.

07:00.739 --> 07:01.739
Wow, I am so proud of you.

07:01.781 --> 07:02.906
Thank you.

07:02.948 --> 07:06.280
I actually had someonerecognize me at lunch today.

07:06.280 --> 07:07.822
It was... surreal.

07:07.864 --> 07:11.113
I knew all your hard workand long hours would pay off.

07:11.155 --> 07:12.906
Well, you know, I figuredit's not just good for me,

07:12.948 --> 07:14.447
it's good for us.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.697
Good for us?

07:20.739 --> 07:21.781
Yeah.

07:21.822 --> 07:23.948
Now that my career's taking off,

07:23.989 --> 07:26.280
I was hoping we could talkabout our future.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.572
Oh, okay.

07:30.614 --> 07:33.989
Um... you know, Philip,

07:34.031 --> 07:34.989
I'm just really focused

07:35.031 --> 07:37.572
on this Sapphire Lake thingfor work.

07:37.614 --> 07:38.948
Maybe we could wait--

07:38.989 --> 07:40.031
Megan...

07:40.072 --> 07:41.822
We've been waiting.

07:41.864 --> 07:43.364
We've been dating, what,

07:43.405 --> 07:44.697
nine months?

07:44.739 --> 07:46.322
I haven't metyour family yet.

07:46.364 --> 07:48.239
Why haven't you invited mehome to Cedarville?

07:49.280 --> 07:50.280
Vale.

07:50.280 --> 07:53.072
It's Cedarvale.

07:54.155 --> 07:56.656
We've been working so much,

07:56.697 --> 07:57.864
both of us.

07:57.906 --> 07:58.906
Is it that,

07:58.948 --> 08:01.280
or is that you'rejust not sure about me?

08:02.614 --> 08:04.489
No, it is... it's not you.

08:04.530 --> 08:06.364
I just, I just need--

08:06.405 --> 08:08.197
"A little more time."

08:08.238 --> 08:09.405
Right?

08:09.447 --> 08:11.781
That's what you sayevery time I bring this up.

08:13.364 --> 08:14.405
Megan...

08:14.447 --> 08:15.781

Goodbye,Dr. Baker.

08:42.948 --> 08:44.030
What is it?

08:44.072 --> 08:46.864
My dad fell off a ladderand fractured his foot.

08:46.906 --> 08:48.530
He's spending the nightin the hospital.

08:48.572 --> 08:51.280
Well, doesn't soundtoo serious. Right?

08:51.322 --> 08:52.197
I can'tmiss my flight

08:52.239 --> 08:53.280
if I'm goingto see my dad

08:53.322 --> 08:55.113
before I meetwith Mrs. Figgins.

08:55.155 --> 08:56.572
So...

08:56.614 --> 08:57.948
where does that leave us?

08:57.948 --> 08:59.447
I promise

08:59.489 --> 09:01.405
I'm going to thinkeverything over.

09:01.447 --> 09:02.405
Fine.

09:02.447 --> 09:03.405
But remember,

09:03.447 --> 09:05.948
the number sevenfastest rising legal star

09:05.948 --> 09:07.364
in Chicago

09:07.405 --> 09:08.906
is not gonna beon the market for long.

You got your scholarship.

10:34.656 --> 10:36.614
That is,if you still want to go.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.572
[sighs]

11:04.697 --> 11:06.113
I'm so sorry.

11:06.113 --> 11:07.781
I guess I got distracted.

11:13.489 --> 11:14.447

11:14.489 --> 11:15.781
Megan?

11:22.405 --> 11:23.405

Are you all right?

11:36.405 --> 11:37.948

11:43.280 --> 11:45.656
Since when is therea stop sign here?

11:45.697 --> 11:47.197
Since a few months ago.

11:47.238 --> 11:48.906
Since when are youback in town?

11:48.948 --> 11:50.113
A few monthsbefore the stop sign.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.447
I came backto take over the farm

11:52.489 --> 11:54.031
after my dad retired.

11:54.073 --> 11:56.031
He and Momare traveling the world.

11:57.280 --> 11:58.948
So, you don't get homemuch, do you?

11:58.989 --> 12:00.447
What's that supposed to mean?

12:00.489 --> 12:01.489
Of course I do.

12:01.530 --> 12:02.656
I come home all the time.

12:02.697 --> 12:03.614
I was just here at Christmas.

12:03.614 --> 12:06.280
I talk to my dad,like, every day.

12:06.322 --> 12:07.656
I don't know whyI'm explaining myself to you.

12:07.697 --> 12:09.322
I'm not sure.

12:09.364 --> 12:10.989
Anyway, um,if everything's good here,

12:11.031 --> 12:11.989
I'm probably gonna...

12:12.031 --> 12:12.864

12:12.906 --> 12:13.989
I'm gonna go.

12:14.031 --> 12:15.155
[chuckling]

12:15.197 --> 12:16.197

12:17.948 --> 12:20.614
How are you?

12:20.614 --> 12:22.113

12:30.239 --> 12:31.031
Amazing?

12:31.073 --> 12:32.781

Congratulations.

12:37.530 --> 12:38.864
Thanks.

12:38.906 --> 12:40.781
And so you're...you're an architect?

12:40.781 --> 12:43.572
I, uh, I workin client relations

12:43.614 --> 12:45.113
at Stoneland.

12:45.113 --> 12:46.113
I'm sure you've heard of us.

12:46.155 --> 12:47.113
We're one of the biggestin our field.

12:47.155 --> 12:48.739
No, I... I haven't.

12:49.948 --> 12:51.447
Anyway, I'm a supervisor.

12:52.447 --> 12:54.447
So, you're...you're not an architect.

12:55.948 --> 12:56.948
What happened to your dream?

12:56.989 --> 13:00.280
I really need to go.

13:00.322 --> 13:01.948
I don't know if you heard,my dad's in the hospital.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.572
No, I-I did hear that.

13:04.614 --> 13:06.155
I actually wentto go see Matt this morning.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.781

Well, goodbye.

13:15.948 --> 13:17.572
[engine starting]

13:26.656 --> 13:27.948
Well, that was fun.

13:27.948 --> 13:31.197
It's straight down here,and then a right on Elm Street.

13:32.781 --> 13:34.447

13:42.697 --> 13:43.781
Dr. Baker says

13:43.781 --> 13:45.656

13:45.697 --> 13:47.614
You have no businessbeing up there.

13:47.614 --> 13:48.948
"No business..."

13:48.948 --> 13:50.280
You make me soundlike an old man.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.280
Mom would not have allowed it.

13:54.073 --> 13:55.948

13:55.989 --> 13:58.781

14:05.280 --> 14:06.989
Bored, Violet.

14:07.031 --> 14:08.322
Hmm.

14:08.364 --> 14:09.864
Hey, have you beenby the café lately?

14:09.906 --> 14:12.447
Yeah, I stopped infor my "to go" coffee.

14:12.447 --> 14:14.405
It was pure chaos.

14:14.447 --> 14:15.489
Waitresscalled in sick again.

14:15.530 --> 14:18.530
I knew it,I knew it!

14:21.073 --> 14:23.447
Can you pull some stringsand get me out of here?

14:23.489 --> 14:25.113
Hey! I heard that.

14:29.113 --> 14:30.405
Yeah, sounds good.

14:30.447 --> 14:31.280
And stay away

14:31.280 --> 14:32.614

14:32.614 --> 14:34.239
I will try.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.447
How's my favoritepatient today?

14:36.447 --> 14:39.322
Oh, you know, could be better,could be worse.

14:39.364 --> 14:40.614
I was speaking to Megan.

14:42.322 --> 14:43.447
[chuckles]

14:43.489 --> 14:45.489
Aw, hey,Dr. Baker.

14:45.530 --> 14:46.864
You are looking moreand more like your mother

14:46.906 --> 14:47.906

14:47.948 --> 14:49.239
Well, thank you.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.572
I can't thinkof a better compliment.

14:51.447 --> 14:53.073
Um, so, is hegoing to be okay?

14:53.113 --> 14:54.322
Yeah, he'll be all right.

14:54.364 --> 14:56.280
Okay, then,when can I get out of here?

14:56.322 --> 14:58.697
I mean, come on,it's Apple Festival Week.

14:58.739 --> 15:00.280
It's my big profit time.

15:00.322 --> 15:02.781
Apparently, my businessis falling apart.

15:02.781 --> 15:04.739
Well, you cango home today if you want.

15:04.781 --> 15:05.781
Well, about time.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.155
Of course, you needto stay off your feet

15:07.197 --> 15:08.989
for a little while,

15:09.031 --> 15:10.155
and out of the café.

15:10.197 --> 15:11.405
Oh, no, no, no,I can't do that.

15:11.447 --> 15:12.656
I've gota business to run.

15:12.697 --> 15:14.530
Okay, I guess we cankeep him here

15:14.572 --> 15:16.031
a little while longer?

15:18.697 --> 15:20.739
Okay, fine,

15:20.781 --> 15:21.864
you win.

15:21.906 --> 15:23.572
You need to letyour foot heal properly

15:23.614 --> 15:25.781
before you returnto work, okay?

15:25.781 --> 15:27.614
And if I hear you've beenback in that café too soon,

15:27.614 --> 15:29.073
you'll have me to answer to.

15:29.114 --> 15:30.114
You understand?

15:30.114 --> 15:31.948
[sighing heavily]Yes, I understand.

15:31.948 --> 15:34.864
Megan, you make surehe keeps his promise.

Okay, I've gotto pack up my things.

I need to get downto the café as soon as possible.

15:43.948 --> 15:47.114
Dad, no, did you hearwhat he just said?

15:47.114 --> 15:49.073
[grumbles dismissively]Ah, doctor talk.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.405
No, I'm fine.

15:50.447 --> 15:51.614
I can do more on one foot

15:51.614 --> 15:53.238
than most folkscould do on three.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.781
Dad, you can't rush things,

15:55.822 --> 15:57.155
or elseit'll make it worse.

15:57.197 --> 15:59.114
Well, what do youexpect me to do?

15:59.114 --> 16:01.031
Burn the place down?

16:03.280 --> 16:05.864
Or...

16:05.906 --> 16:07.781
Or you could, uh...

16:07.822 --> 16:10.614
you could work with mefor a while.

16:10.656 --> 16:12.781
No. No, no, Dad, no,

16:12.781 --> 16:13.781
I cannot do that.

16:13.822 --> 16:14.948
[sighing] Well...

16:14.948 --> 16:17.989
I guess I'll justhave to call Dottie, and...

16:18.031 --> 16:20.031
have her shut it down.

16:23.238 --> 16:24.948
Okay, I will help out.

16:24.948 --> 16:26.114
Are you sureyou can handle it?

16:26.155 --> 16:29.822
Dad, I've done every jobpossible at Rosie's.

16:29.864 --> 16:31.530
[cell phone rings]How hard can it be?

16:33.697 --> 16:34.781
I've justgot to get this.

One sec.

I mean,I'm on my way there

16:43.781 --> 16:45.656
right now.-Good.

16:45.697 --> 16:46.989
With what we're offering her,she should be begging us,

16:47.031 --> 16:48.155
and not the other way around.

16:48.197 --> 16:49.489
Now, your job is to convince her

16:49.530 --> 16:51.656
that this deal is in her best interest.

16:51.697 --> 16:52.822
Oh, and, Ms. Quinn?

16:52.864 --> 16:54.405

17:42.989 --> 17:45.073
Thank you.

17:45.114 --> 17:47.948
To what do I owethis pleasure?

17:47.948 --> 17:50.197
Well, I was just in townvisiting my dad,

17:50.238 --> 17:52.238
and I thoughtI'd stop by and say hi.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.906
Oh, yes,that's right.

17:53.948 --> 17:55.948
I heard Mattwas in the hospital.

Now, how's he doing?

17:57.197 --> 17:58.948
Oh, he's fine,thank you.

17:58.948 --> 18:00.114
He just fractured his foot.

18:00.155 --> 18:02.822
Oh dear, that sounds painful.

18:02.864 --> 18:03.906
Please,

Have you seen Joe?

18:09.114 --> 18:12.239
He's backin town, you know.

18:12.280 --> 18:15.572
I bumped into him earlier.

18:15.614 --> 18:16.614
Once upon a time,

18:16.614 --> 18:19.864
you two were liketwo peas in a pod.

18:19.906 --> 18:22.114
But I guesstimes change, huh?

Okay. Frances...

18:35.489 --> 18:36.614
[chuckles fondly]

18:36.656 --> 18:39.614
Uh, Frances, I hopeyou don't think I'm intruding.

18:39.656 --> 18:41.489
I rang the doorbell,but no one came, so--

18:41.530 --> 18:43.572
Oh, listen,it's no intrusion.

18:43.614 --> 18:45.739
As a matter of fact,it's a nice diversion.

18:45.781 --> 18:46.697
When the doorbell rang,

18:46.739 --> 18:48.322
I thought you were one of them.

18:49.280 --> 18:50.781
"Them"?

18:50.781 --> 18:52.614
Those horrible developers.

18:52.614 --> 18:54.614
Did you know thatthere's this company

18:54.656 --> 18:56.073
trying to buy up my home

18:56.114 --> 18:57.447
and turn it intoa shopping mall?

18:57.447 --> 18:59.114
They think they canjust throw money at me,

18:59.114 --> 19:01.447
and I'll hand over my propertywithout a thought

19:01.489 --> 19:03.239
as to how they intendto use the land.

19:05.114 --> 19:06.280
Anyway...

19:06.322 --> 19:10.031
Megan, it's so good to see you.

19:10.073 --> 19:12.197
I mean, what are you doingthese days?

19:12.239 --> 19:14.364
Uh... well,

19:14.405 --> 19:16.822
I work at Stoneland Properties.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.864
I'm in clientrelations.

19:21.197 --> 19:23.572
Um, I know you'vespoken to my boss

19:23.614 --> 19:24.781
several times,

19:24.781 --> 19:26.781
Jordan St. Clair,

19:26.781 --> 19:28.280
but he wanted meto come here

19:28.322 --> 19:30.155
and personallytake you through--

19:30.197 --> 19:32.280
Ms. Quinn...

19:32.322 --> 19:34.364
We reallyfeel like this development

19:34.405 --> 19:36.948
is gonna energizethe local economy

19:36.948 --> 19:39.822
and create hundreds ofgreat new jobs for people--

19:39.864 --> 19:40.989
Ms. Quinn.

19:41.031 --> 19:43.280
Please, just call me Megan.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.781
Ms. Quinn.

19:44.822 --> 19:46.989
I am not interested.

19:49.530 --> 19:52.322
Listen, I understand

19:52.364 --> 19:54.073
if you arereluctant to sell.

19:54.114 --> 19:55.031
I mean, look at this place.

19:55.073 --> 19:57.530
Reluctantto sell?

19:57.572 --> 19:59.614
Actually,it's quite the opposite.

19:59.656 --> 20:02.031
I have been planning to sellfor some time.

20:02.073 --> 20:03.906
I mean,I'm getting older,

20:03.948 --> 20:05.073
and pretty soon

20:05.114 --> 20:07.906
this place is gonna becometoo much for me.

20:07.948 --> 20:10.781
I had plannedto put my house on the market

20:10.781 --> 20:12.447
and move to Florida

20:12.447 --> 20:14.364
and live with my daughterand my grandchildren.

20:14.405 --> 20:16.948
If I sell to you,

20:16.989 --> 20:18.614
I will be responsible

20:18.656 --> 20:21.322
for this monstrosityof asphalt and cement

20:21.364 --> 20:23.572
that they're proposing.

20:23.614 --> 20:25.447
I couldn't live with myself.

20:26.322 --> 20:28.447
So, have youseen the plans?

20:28.489 --> 20:30.073
Of course I have,

20:30.114 --> 20:31.781
and the localplanning commission

20:31.781 --> 20:33.280
will never approvethe development

20:33.322 --> 20:34.989
as long as I ownthis property.

20:35.822 --> 20:37.530
Planning commission?

20:37.572 --> 20:38.989
I sent them overa basket

20:39.031 --> 20:40.906
of my freshly bakedpumpkin muffins

20:40.948 --> 20:42.614
at their last meeting.

20:42.614 --> 20:45.197
They said they were delicious.

20:45.238 --> 20:50.280
So, it looks like I holdall the cards, Ms. Quinn.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.364
Good day.

20:51.405 --> 20:52.489
Frances, if I could just--

20:52.530 --> 20:55.572
Please, it's, it's,it's Mrs. Figgins,

20:55.614 --> 20:58.822
and this conversation is over.

21:00.989 --> 21:02.614
What happened to you?

21:02.656 --> 21:06.572
To the girl thatI used to know?

21:06.614 --> 21:09.656
You were going to dogreat things.

21:15.364 --> 21:17.948
[door closes]

21:27.656 --> 21:29.614
[sighs]

21:37.781 --> 21:40.114
[Chloe]: How'd it go with Mrs... What's her name?

21:40.156 --> 21:42.031
So far, she's not budging.

21:42.073 --> 21:44.239
Oh, all you needed...

21:44.280 --> 21:45.447
That's not good.

21:45.447 --> 21:47.989
No, it's not.

21:48.031 --> 21:49.364
Sorry it didn't go well.

21:49.405 --> 21:54.530
And to make matters worse,my ex is back in town.

21:54.572 --> 21:55.948
Oh, wow.

21:55.989 --> 21:57.447
Your ex?

21:57.447 --> 21:59.073
Please elaborate.

21:59.114 --> 22:01.614
Well, to make a very long story short,

22:01.656 --> 22:03.989
his name's Joe.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.322
We grew up together,

22:05.364 --> 22:07.447
dated all through high school,

22:07.447 --> 22:09.948
and then, a week intomy freshman year of college,

22:09.948 --> 22:11.948
he sent me a letterbreaking up with me,

22:11.948 --> 22:14.614
said we'd grown apart, whatever that means.

22:14.656 --> 22:16.530
Then, when I tried to call him,

22:16.572 --> 22:18.489
he wouldn't take my calls.

22:18.530 --> 22:20.530
That had to sting.

22:20.572 --> 22:22.614
So, whatever happened to him?

22:22.614 --> 22:24.114
He moved away,

22:24.114 --> 22:25.864
met someone, got married,

22:25.906 --> 22:28.156
had a baby girl.

22:28.197 --> 22:30.197
Actually, his wife passed away.

22:30.238 --> 22:32.239
How sad.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.156
Yeah.

22:33.197 --> 22:36.156
He's been a single dadever since.

22:36.197 --> 22:37.906
And just when I thought

22:37.948 --> 22:40.322
I'd probably neversee him again,

22:40.364 --> 22:42.197
I ran into him today.

22:42.239 --> 22:43.280
Literally.

22:43.280 --> 22:45.739
I ran into his pickup truck.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.739
[chuckles] Ouch.

22:47.781 --> 22:49.197
Ah, sweet freedom!

22:49.238 --> 22:52.405
Ha ha!Now I can get some real food.

22:52.447 --> 22:53.989
Oh, hey, honey!

22:54.031 --> 22:55.530
Chloe, I gotta go.

22:55.572 --> 22:56.530
I'll call you back.

22:58.364 --> 23:00.989

23:06.238 --> 23:07.280
Oof.

23:07.322 --> 23:09.073
I got you.

23:09.114 --> 23:10.156
Aw, thanks, darling.

23:10.197 --> 23:11.197
No problem.

23:15.572 --> 23:16.781
Lunch is served.

23:16.822 --> 23:18.156
Excellent.

23:20.948 --> 23:23.239
Um... there's...there's no meat.

23:23.280 --> 23:26.656
We're eating healthytoday, Dad.

23:28.781 --> 23:30.572
So...

23:30.614 --> 23:32.280
how are you feeling?

23:33.572 --> 23:35.614
I'm fine.

23:35.614 --> 23:37.572
I don't need a babysitter.

23:37.614 --> 23:38.656
I know you don't.

[cell phone rings]

23:41.781 --> 23:43.906
Megan Quinn.

23:43.948 --> 23:47.364
So, how did your meetingwith Mrs. Figgins go?

23:47.405 --> 23:49.405
It went...

23:49.447 --> 23:50.447
really well.

23:50.489 --> 23:53.238
Yes, well, I was waiting for an update.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.197
Yeah, I was just aboutto call you.

23:55.238 --> 23:57.238
The reception'sreally spotty here.

23:57.280 --> 23:58.739
You know, small towns.

23:58.781 --> 23:59.697
Hmm.

23:59.739 --> 24:00.948
So, you'll havegood news for me soon?

24:00.989 --> 24:02.572
Yes, I will.

24:02.614 --> 24:03.906
We're very close.

24:03.948 --> 24:05.447
That's whatI like to hear, Ms. Quinn.

24:05.489 --> 24:08.114
You call me as soon as youhave the signed documents.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.197
Will do.

24:11.989 --> 24:13.238
What was that all about?

24:15.447 --> 24:16.781
Can I trust younot to overdo it

24:16.822 --> 24:18.114
if I head out for a little bit?

24:18.156 --> 24:19.781
Of course.

24:19.822 --> 24:23.280
Like I said,I don't need a babysitter.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.447
Okay.

24:38.948 --> 24:41.697

Wow, that's a long time ago.

25:27.073 --> 25:27.989

25:30.238 --> 25:31.572
we used to ride bikes together.

25:31.614 --> 25:33.073
-Really?-Mm-hm.

Do you want to comebike riding with us?

But I...

27:00.280 --> 27:01.405
Wait, you want meto wait tables?

Dottie, I haven'twaited tables in years,

27:05.781 --> 27:08.447
and I'm already latefor my meeting.

27:09.948 --> 27:11.280
to give him a call,

27:11.280 --> 27:13.405
and he'd be in the next cabdown here to do it himself.

27:22.280 --> 27:23.364

27:28.697 --> 27:29.656

31:05.073 --> 31:06.447
the mysterious manin your life.

31:07.822 --> 31:08.989
He's not mysterious.

31:09.031 --> 31:09.989
Well, Ihaven't met him,

31:10.031 --> 31:11.364
and I'm your best friend.

31:11.405 --> 31:12.739
He's just busy.

31:12.781 --> 31:14.447
[Joe]: I've heardall about him.

31:14.447 --> 31:15.614
His name is Philip,

31:15.614 --> 31:18.156
and he's a big-time attorney.

31:19.031 --> 31:20.489
Yeah.

31:20.530 --> 31:22.280
We met at a party.

31:22.322 --> 31:23.405
What's he like?

31:23.447 --> 31:25.697
Violet, I've told youabout Philip before.

31:25.739 --> 31:26.572
I know,

31:26.614 --> 31:28.781

31:37.989 --> 31:39.906
and he is really...

31:39.948 --> 31:41.489
neat.

31:41.530 --> 31:44.114
Not like a neat-freak "neat,"

31:44.156 --> 31:46.073
but just, like, neat.

31:46.114 --> 31:47.739
And he is, uh,

31:47.781 --> 31:49.989

32:12.322 --> 32:13.781
That's deep.

32:13.822 --> 32:14.739
Shakespeare?

32:14.781 --> 32:16.906
I think it's a 1990sR & B song.

32:16.948 --> 32:19.240
Well, it's romantic,

32:19.280 --> 32:21.447
if not original.

32:21.447 --> 32:23.405
Thank you.

32:25.447 --> 32:27.447
It's quitethe extravagant bouquet.

32:27.489 --> 32:29.198
He must really miss you.

32:30.322 --> 32:31.656
What's that supposed to mean?

32:31.697 --> 32:33.989
It's just an observation.

32:34.031 --> 32:35.614
-Huh.-Here you go.

32:35.656 --> 32:38.906
Wait. Rodrigo,what's this?

32:38.948 --> 32:39.906
Shopping list.

32:42.156 --> 32:44.405
Yeah, Matt handlesall the shopping for the café,

32:44.447 --> 32:45.572
along with the repairs,inventory,

32:45.614 --> 32:48.031
invoices,supplies, payroll.

32:48.073 --> 32:49.447
The usual.

32:49.447 --> 32:51.781
But I...I can't do all that.

32:51.781 --> 32:54.073
I don't actually work here.

32:54.114 --> 32:55.322
Well, I talked to Matt,

32:55.364 --> 32:56.781
and he said you're in chargetill he gets back, so...

32:56.781 --> 32:57.614
But...

32:57.656 --> 32:58.697
Hey, don't worry.You'll do fine.

33:00.948 --> 33:03.614
We have a little problemin the kitchen, boss.

33:03.614 --> 33:06.489
A little problem?

33:11.322 --> 33:12.489

33:12.530 --> 33:14.614
Dishwasher goes on the fritzabout once a month.

33:14.614 --> 33:17.114
Matt refusesto get a new one.

33:17.156 --> 33:19.280
Well, this isunacceptable,

33:19.280 --> 33:20.989
but I reallydon't have time

33:21.031 --> 33:22.489
to deal with thisright now.

33:22.530 --> 33:24.781
We need to clear something up.

33:24.781 --> 33:25.906
I have a job,

33:25.948 --> 33:27.322
and I am undera lot of pressure

33:27.364 --> 33:28.280
to do that job,

33:28.322 --> 33:30.948
and I didn't come hereto play waitress,

33:30.948 --> 33:33.948
or fix dishwashers,or fill shopping lists,

33:33.948 --> 33:35.614
so I quit!

33:35.614 --> 33:36.864

33:49.530 --> 33:50.906
But what am I supposedto do with this?

33:50.948 --> 33:52.198
I'll take a look.

33:52.239 --> 33:53.530
No, thank you.

33:53.572 --> 33:55.322
We got it.

33:55.364 --> 33:56.989
Dottie, who handlesthis sort of thing?

33:57.031 --> 33:58.697
Well, Matt does,

33:58.739 --> 34:00.156
and when he can'thandle it,

34:00.198 --> 34:01.697
he calls Joe.

34:01.739 --> 34:02.739
[Rodrigo]: Dottie,you got customers.

34:02.781 --> 34:04.781
Hold your horses.

34:04.822 --> 34:07.697
Whatever you do,please do it fast.

34:17.114 --> 34:18.239
I should probably...

34:18.280 --> 34:19.530
Please?

34:19.572 --> 34:20.781
Yeah.

34:20.781 --> 34:21.697
Thank you.

Let's go finishour coffee.

34:29.114 --> 34:30.530

Most things.

34:35.947 --> 34:36.947
Good.

34:36.947 --> 34:38.906
Because I'mat an impasse.

34:38.947 --> 34:40.530
I have until Monday morning

34:40.572 --> 34:43.114
to convince...a certain someone

34:43.156 --> 34:44.822
to sell her property,

34:44.864 --> 34:45.781
and she doesn't want to budge,

34:45.822 --> 34:47.239
because she doesn't likethe plans.

34:48.614 --> 34:50.197
I'm sorry, that's justnot my area,

34:50.239 --> 34:52.614
but I'm sureyou'll figure it out.

34:53.656 --> 34:55.364
Great. Thanks.

34:57.530 --> 34:59.989
So, do you thinkthe dishwasher will stay fixed?

35:00.031 --> 35:01.447
Yeah, witha little TLC,

35:01.447 --> 35:02.989
she'll pull through.

35:04.031 --> 35:06.031
Why do you thinkit's a "she"?

35:06.073 --> 35:08.280
Your dad calls her Flo.

35:08.280 --> 35:09.614
Flo?

35:09.656 --> 35:11.614
Clever.

35:12.948 --> 35:16.073
So, uh, what do I owe you?

35:16.114 --> 35:17.114
Um...

35:17.156 --> 35:18.530
It's no charge.

35:18.572 --> 35:20.280
Dad!

35:20.280 --> 35:22.114
I beat Rodrigoin Go Fish!

35:22.114 --> 35:23.948
What?

35:23.948 --> 35:25.114
That's impressive.

35:25.156 --> 35:27.447
I don't beat Rodrigoat anything.

35:27.447 --> 35:28.280
It's easy.

35:28.322 --> 35:29.447
Can we go home now?

35:29.447 --> 35:30.697
I need to get readyfor the hayride.

35:30.739 --> 35:32.031

35:32.073 --> 35:34.697
Are you comingto the hayride later?

35:35.948 --> 35:36.989
Um...

It's the Apple Festival,

35:38.405 --> 35:39.656

35:43.156 --> 35:45.280
Remember?

There's the hayride,

35:46.864 --> 35:48.781

35:48.822 --> 35:50.198
It's so much fun!

35:51.405 --> 35:53.447
You know what,it's been a really long day,

35:53.447 --> 35:54.697
but maybe another time.

[together]: Small towns.

40:33.447 --> 40:35.073
Listen, she justreally likes you,

40:35.114 --> 40:36.656
and she won't take my calls.

40:36.697 --> 40:40.114
Why won't shetake your calls?

40:40.156 --> 40:43.281
My company purchaseda few hundred acres

40:43.322 --> 40:44.739
around Sapphire Lake

40:44.781 --> 40:46.198
for a new retaildevelopment.

40:46.239 --> 40:47.447
We can't break ground

40:47.489 --> 40:49.114
because we needMrs. Figgins' land,

40:49.114 --> 40:51.948
and she refusesto sell to us.

40:51.948 --> 40:55.489
Without her property,the deal is dead.

40:55.530 --> 40:58.281
Your "certain someone?"

40:59.281 --> 41:00.614
Yeah.

41:04.281 --> 41:07.281
So you want me to help you

41:07.322 --> 41:09.447
force a poor old ladyout of her home?

41:09.447 --> 41:12.322
What? No.Of course not.

41:12.364 --> 41:14.281
No one's forcing anyone.

41:14.322 --> 41:16.656
She wants to sellso she can move to Florida.

41:16.697 --> 41:18.114
She just doesn't wantto sell to us,

41:18.156 --> 41:19.530
because she doesn't likethe plans.

41:19.572 --> 41:21.281
If I can pull this off,

41:21.281 --> 41:23.781
I might finally getto realize my dream.

41:23.822 --> 41:26.322
I might actuallyget to be an architect,

41:26.364 --> 41:30.614
and... Frances is goingto end up selling to someone.

41:30.614 --> 41:34.614
Besides, it'll bringhundreds of jobs to Cedarvale.

41:34.656 --> 41:38.489
This is a good thing.Will you please help me?

What's that?

41:53.198 --> 41:55.447
It's something that startedafter you moved away.

A lot of people intown get together,

41:57.697 --> 41:59.656

41:59.697 --> 42:00.781
so the visitors to the Festival

42:00.822 --> 42:02.822
can taste the bestCedarvale has to offer.

42:02.864 --> 42:04.031

My mom wasa great baker.

Please, Dad?

42:29.073 --> 42:30.614
Okay, all right.

42:30.656 --> 42:32.156
I'll do it.

We shouldbake something.

I can help youmake an apple pie.

42:36.489 --> 42:37.364
Yeah!

How hard couldthat be, right?

You know, Lily's goingto a friend's house tomorrow

43:03.240 --> 43:05.156

43:05.198 --> 43:07.906
why don't you come bythe farm around noon?

Just for a minute.

44:12.989 --> 44:15.739
I wanted to see this.

44:16.739 --> 44:18.781
Wow, I'd forgottenhow beautiful it is.

You used to say

44:22.530 --> 44:25.614
this was your favoriteplace on Earth.

44:25.614 --> 44:26.864
Remember?

44:29.781 --> 44:31.239
You have a really good memory.

For things that areworth remembering.

That was my dad.

45:01.156 --> 45:02.614
I need to get backto the café right away.

45:02.656 --> 45:04.656
Did he say why?

45:04.697 --> 45:06.405
No. He just says

45:06.447 --> 45:07.822
that I need to get thereas soon as possible.

45:07.864 --> 45:09.614
We should go, then.

You know, you never reallygave me an explanation

46:10.906 --> 46:12.697
for why you broke up with me.

46:12.739 --> 46:14.530
It was a long time ago.

Yes.

Do you still draw?

51:54.447 --> 51:58.281
Look, I promised them 12 bales of hay by 5:00 p.m.

51:58.281 --> 52:01.614
and Lily promised thema pie by 6:00, so...

52:01.614 --> 52:02.781
help?

52:02.822 --> 52:04.948
Well, I'm at the café.

52:04.989 --> 52:08.656
Bring Lily, bring the apples,uh, you deliver your hay.

52:08.697 --> 52:09.614
[sighing in relief]

52:09.656 --> 52:11.114
You are a savior.

52:11.156 --> 52:12.240
Thank you so much.

52:12.281 --> 52:14.489
Don't mention it.

52:14.530 --> 52:15.906
Bye.

52:17.031 --> 52:18.073
A goat ate the pie.

52:21.405 --> 52:23.781
It happens.

52:37.198 --> 52:38.697
[chuckling]

52:41.739 --> 52:42.781
Hey.

52:42.822 --> 52:44.948
You know what, Lily?

52:44.948 --> 52:47.697
My mother used to makethe most delicious apple cake.

52:47.739 --> 52:48.864
Your mom? Rosie?

52:48.906 --> 52:49.781
Yeah.

52:49.781 --> 52:50.822
Maybe we should make that?

52:50.864 --> 52:51.781
You and me?

52:51.822 --> 52:52.656
Yeah!

52:52.697 --> 52:54.114
Yeah, okay.

52:54.114 --> 52:55.614
Come here,let's get you an apron.

52:57.365 --> 52:58.614
Okay.

52:58.656 --> 53:01.114
Thank you so much.

53:01.156 --> 53:02.281
You're welcome.

53:02.281 --> 53:03.281
Bye, Dad.

53:03.323 --> 53:05.281
Goodbye.

53:05.281 --> 53:06.656
Have fun, girls.

53:06.697 --> 53:08.114
[Megan]:My mom always said

53:08.114 --> 53:10.031
thatthe first ingredient is love,

53:10.073 --> 53:12.530
when baking.

53:12.572 --> 53:14.073
The trick is,

53:14.114 --> 53:17.073
don't squeeze the eggs.

53:17.114 --> 53:21.323
You want to pull them apart,just like that.

53:21.365 --> 53:23.447
All right,Wainwright apples, going in.

53:23.489 --> 53:26.697
I'm gonna let youstir it all up.

53:26.739 --> 53:28.447
Good.

53:28.447 --> 53:29.822
You want to stir it?-Okay.

53:29.864 --> 53:31.906
[♪♪]

53:31.948 --> 53:34.198
It's hard work, right?

53:41.281 --> 53:42.489
[laughing]

53:42.530 --> 53:44.198
[chuckles]

53:49.697 --> 53:53.781
So the Festival folksliked the cake?

53:53.781 --> 53:56.614
It was hard to tell.

53:56.656 --> 53:57.530
We put it on display,

53:57.572 --> 54:00.365
someone came over,took a bite,

54:00.405 --> 54:01.781
next thing we know,it was gone in five minutes.

54:01.781 --> 54:03.989
So Lily was pleased.

54:04.031 --> 54:05.281
Yes.

54:05.281 --> 54:06.864
Yes, she was very pleased.

54:06.906 --> 54:08.365
Good.

54:12.739 --> 54:14.906
What's wrong?

54:19.447 --> 54:22.739
It's just,Lily is bonding with you,

54:22.781 --> 54:24.405
and it's great...

54:25.614 --> 54:27.323
but you're not goingto be here long,

54:27.365 --> 54:29.739
you know?

54:29.781 --> 54:31.948
Well, I can keep in touch.

54:31.948 --> 54:33.365
It's not the same.

54:33.406 --> 54:35.447
I appreciate the offer.

54:40.114 --> 54:42.156
You are so muchlike your mother.

54:44.530 --> 54:46.114
Thank you.

54:46.114 --> 54:47.073
That's a wonderful compliment.

54:47.114 --> 54:48.739
She was a wonderful person.

54:50.281 --> 54:53.489
You just care so muchabout other people.

54:53.530 --> 54:54.948
So do you.

54:58.530 --> 55:00.489
You know, my mother alwaysthought of you

55:00.530 --> 55:03.031
as the son she never had.

55:14.697 --> 55:16.656
How serious are you?

55:16.697 --> 55:17.948
About...?

55:17.948 --> 55:20.864
Mr. Polo player.

55:22.365 --> 55:23.948
Uh, Philip.

55:23.989 --> 55:24.989
Um...

55:25.031 --> 55:28.656
Well, he'sa really great guy.

55:28.697 --> 55:31.114
He's very ambitious.

55:31.156 --> 55:32.781
He's probably going to runfor office someday.

55:32.781 --> 55:35.240
You didn't answer my question.

55:38.156 --> 55:41.281
He's really good to me.

55:41.281 --> 55:44.489
Still didn't answermy question.

55:44.530 --> 55:46.948
He's... I'm...

55:46.989 --> 55:48.614
Look, it'sgetting late.

55:48.614 --> 55:50.822
Yeah, sure.

55:57.156 --> 55:58.365
Thanksfor the baking help.

55:59.572 --> 56:01.864
Anytime.

56:05.031 --> 56:07.240

56:30.948 --> 56:32.697
Cedarvale.

56:35.198 --> 56:38.572
[♪♪]

56:44.281 --> 56:46.989
[Lily]:Let's go! Come on! This way!

56:50.198 --> 56:52.114
Say hi tothe family, okay?

56:56.822 --> 56:57.864
Hey.

56:57.906 --> 56:59.073
Hi.

56:59.114 --> 57:00.114
[Dr. Baker]: Could I haveyour attention, please?

57:00.114 --> 57:01.031

57:13.697 --> 57:14.614
And for those of you

57:14.656 --> 57:16.281
who contributed to our hospital,

57:16.281 --> 57:18.864

57:18.906 --> 57:20.614
[applause]-I mean...

57:22.822 --> 57:24.781
And now, for this year'sPeople's Choice

57:33.281 --> 57:34.614
[applause and cheers]

57:34.614 --> 57:36.240
Oh, my gosh!

57:36.281 --> 57:37.114
Yeah!

57:37.156 --> 57:39.281
-What?-We did it.

57:39.281 --> 57:40.281
Thank you, Megan.

57:41.323 --> 57:43.948
I think your motherwould be so proud of you.

57:43.948 --> 57:45.114
Thanks.

57:45.114 --> 57:46.323
I think so too.

57:46.365 --> 57:48.614
Come on,let's go tell Rodrigo!

57:48.614 --> 57:50.365
Okay, all right,all right.

57:52.114 --> 57:53.614
Hey...

57:53.656 --> 57:55.156
wanna come?

57:57.114 --> 57:58.323
You go.

57:58.365 --> 58:00.406
It's a Wainwright moment.

58:15.447 --> 58:18.614
I play golf every Sunday,Ms. Quinn.

58:18.614 --> 58:20.281
It relaxes me.

58:20.323 --> 58:22.697
But today, I'm not relaxed.

58:22.739 --> 58:24.281
Now, why do you think that is?

58:24.281 --> 58:26.948
Well, you said it rained...

58:26.989 --> 58:28.864
That's the least of it, Ms. Quinn.

58:28.906 --> 58:30.614
Try again.

58:30.614 --> 58:32.447
You're worried aboutthe Sapphire Lake project?

58:32.489 --> 58:33.739
Exactly.

58:33.781 --> 58:35.198
Now, I got in six holes,

58:35.239 --> 58:37.114
and I was five over par.

58:37.114 --> 58:38.447
I'm a scratch golfer,Ms. Quinn,

58:38.489 --> 58:39.781
so life is not good.

58:39.781 --> 58:41.948
Well, at leastnow you can relax

58:41.948 --> 58:44.114
and go back to enjoyingthe rest of your Sunday.

58:44.156 --> 58:45.281
I'm back at my office.

58:45.323 --> 58:46.989
Who relaxes at work?

58:47.031 --> 58:48.781
You do remember work, Ms. Quinn?

58:48.822 --> 58:50.489
Now, tell me,

58:50.530 --> 58:53.365
what is happening with this Mrs. Figgins?

58:53.406 --> 58:55.281
Uh, she's beinga little difficult.

58:55.323 --> 58:56.781
Well, that's why I gave you this job.

58:56.822 --> 58:58.614
You're supposed to be able to handle difficult,

58:58.614 --> 59:00.281
help her overcome her reservations

59:00.323 --> 59:01.614
and get the deal done.

59:01.656 --> 59:03.240
Now, you do your job,

59:03.281 --> 59:04.781
or else you'll be lookingfor a new one.

59:04.822 --> 59:05.906
[beeping]

59:05.948 --> 59:07.114
[muttering] Great.

59:07.156 --> 59:08.447
Oh...

59:08.447 --> 59:09.406
Hey, Matt!

59:09.447 --> 59:10.864
Hey!

59:10.906 --> 59:11.822
Good morning!

59:11.864 --> 59:14.739
Dad, what are you doing here?

59:14.781 --> 59:16.240
Well, I got tiredof sitting around the house,

59:16.281 --> 59:18.447
so I thought I'd justcome by and, uh...

59:18.489 --> 59:19.697
do a little cleaning?

59:21.156 --> 59:24.031
Don't worry,I'm not gonna overdo it.

59:24.073 --> 59:25.906
[chuckling] Look at you.

59:25.948 --> 59:29.489
Oh, your mother'd begrinning from ear to ear.

59:29.530 --> 59:30.697
Hey, Matt,how you feelin'?

59:30.739 --> 59:32.198
Like a manwith a busted foot.

59:32.240 --> 59:33.822
Well, you're backin the nick of time, boss.

59:33.864 --> 59:35.031
Megan here

59:35.073 --> 59:36.156
was just about to runthis place into the ground.

59:36.198 --> 59:39.031
Oh, stop it,she did just fine.

59:39.073 --> 59:39.948
So it seems.

59:39.948 --> 59:41.614
Well, welcome back.I gotta go.

59:41.614 --> 59:43.281
Where are you going?I just got here.

59:43.281 --> 59:45.198
I have a meetingto go to.

59:45.240 --> 59:46.281
I'll see you later.

59:46.323 --> 59:47.697
A meeting?

59:47.739 --> 59:49.614
On Sunday?

01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:02.447
This one's perfect.

01:00:02.447 --> 01:00:03.614
Dad and I are goingto make applesauce.

01:00:03.614 --> 01:00:06.031
Just don't letthe goats know, okay?

01:00:06.073 --> 01:00:06.948
[chuckles]

01:00:09.781 --> 01:00:13.114
I thought you weresupposed to leave by noon.

01:00:13.114 --> 01:00:15.281
Yeah.

01:00:15.281 --> 01:00:18.281
I'm headed out to see Francesagain this afternoon.

01:00:18.323 --> 01:00:19.448
I have no choice.

01:00:19.489 --> 01:00:20.614
If I can't get her to signby tomorrow morning,

01:00:20.614 --> 01:00:21.614
I'm out of a job.

01:00:23.156 --> 01:00:25.156
Well...

01:00:25.198 --> 01:00:26.697
You want me to come with you?

01:00:26.739 --> 01:00:27.572
No.

01:00:27.614 --> 01:00:29.739
I just...

01:00:29.781 --> 01:00:30.781
Anyway, I gotta get going.

01:00:31.989 --> 01:00:32.948
Hey, you okay?

01:00:32.948 --> 01:00:35.114
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:00:35.156 --> 01:00:37.198
See ya.

01:00:38.448 --> 01:00:41.114
Megan, hey...

01:00:41.156 --> 01:00:43.614
I know whenyou're not okay.

01:00:43.614 --> 01:00:45.697
I always have.

01:00:45.739 --> 01:00:47.781
Talk to me.

01:00:47.781 --> 01:00:49.614
[sighs heavily]

01:00:49.614 --> 01:00:51.281
Am I doingthe right thing,

01:00:51.323 --> 01:00:53.656
with Frances?

01:00:53.697 --> 01:00:55.948
I mean,I'm not sure anymore.

01:00:55.948 --> 01:00:56.822
Why aren't you sure?

01:00:56.864 --> 01:01:00.281
Because it doesn't feel right.

01:01:00.281 --> 01:01:03.781
When I was little,Frances was so kind to me.

01:01:03.822 --> 01:01:07.281
She encouraged me,and believed in me.

01:01:07.281 --> 01:01:08.448
And now allI can think about

01:01:08.489 --> 01:01:09.864
is getting herto do what I want

01:01:09.906 --> 01:01:11.697
so I can getsome promotion

01:01:11.739 --> 01:01:14.281
and advance my career.

01:01:14.281 --> 01:01:15.697
Is that wrong?

01:01:15.739 --> 01:01:17.281
You know...

01:01:17.281 --> 01:01:19.323
I think,sometimes in life,

01:01:19.365 --> 01:01:21.614
we put on blinders,

01:01:21.614 --> 01:01:23.781
and we think there's onlytwo solutions to a problem.

01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:24.864
What do you mean?

01:01:24.906 --> 01:01:25.948
Well, look,you think

01:01:25.989 --> 01:01:27.156
that Frances eithersells you the property

01:01:27.198 --> 01:01:29.156
or she says no,and the project's dead.

01:01:29.198 --> 01:01:30.948
Yeah, that pretty muchsums it up.

01:01:30.948 --> 01:01:32.572
Well, what if there wasanother option?

01:01:32.614 --> 01:01:34.864
A third option?

01:01:34.906 --> 01:01:35.864
Yeah.

01:01:35.906 --> 01:01:36.697
What?

01:01:36.739 --> 01:01:38.906
Well, I don't know.

01:01:38.948 --> 01:01:40.156
But...

01:01:40.198 --> 01:01:42.198
what I've found isthat when you admit

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.323
there could beanother solution,

01:01:44.365 --> 01:01:46.281
one ends up showing up.

01:01:48.781 --> 01:01:51.948
I'd better get going.Frances is expecting me.

01:01:51.948 --> 01:01:52.864
Bye, Lily.

01:01:52.906 --> 01:01:54.156
Bye, Megan.

01:01:54.198 --> 01:01:55.031
See you later.

01:01:55.948 --> 01:01:56.864
For Frances.

01:01:56.906 --> 01:01:59.614
She loves apples.

01:01:59.656 --> 01:02:00.614
Good luck!

01:02:00.656 --> 01:02:02.739
Thanks.

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.781
So, Megan's going home soon,

01:02:12.822 --> 01:02:13.864
huh, Dad?

01:02:13.906 --> 01:02:15.365
That's right.

01:02:18.781 --> 01:02:19.948
Are you going to miss her?

01:02:21.448 --> 01:02:23.239
A little.

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:25.906
I miss Mommy,

01:02:25.948 --> 01:02:28.448
even though I was little.

01:02:28.448 --> 01:02:30.240
Sometimes I wishI could tell her that.

01:02:31.781 --> 01:02:32.614
So...

01:02:32.656 --> 01:02:34.073
if you're going to miss Megan,

01:02:34.114 --> 01:02:35.323
I think you should tell her,

01:02:35.365 --> 01:02:36.614
or she'll never know.

01:02:39.323 --> 01:02:40.656
[chuckles]

01:02:44.572 --> 01:02:45.406
You know what,

01:02:45.448 --> 01:02:47.281
I thinkyou're right.

01:02:47.281 --> 01:02:48.948
We're done apple picking.

01:02:48.948 --> 01:02:50.448
All right?-Okay.

01:02:54.281 --> 01:02:57.198
[♪♪]

01:03:02.114 --> 01:03:04.156
I love this view.

01:03:04.198 --> 01:03:06.906
That drawing you oncemade of my house?

01:03:06.948 --> 01:03:08.073
I still have it,

01:03:08.114 --> 01:03:10.281
framed,near my mantle.

01:03:10.323 --> 01:03:13.281
Oh, wow,I'm flattered.

01:03:13.281 --> 01:03:16.906
Ah, you were alwaystalented, Megan.

01:03:16.948 --> 01:03:17.989
Always.

01:03:19.323 --> 01:03:21.781
Oh, it's stillso beautiful, isn't it?

01:03:21.822 --> 01:03:24.781
The reflection of leaveson the water?

01:03:24.781 --> 01:03:26.323
Yeah, it is.

01:03:26.365 --> 01:03:28.948
I used to loveto come down here as a girl

01:03:28.948 --> 01:03:30.073
and skip stones.

01:03:30.114 --> 01:03:31.406
Oh, me too.

01:03:31.448 --> 01:03:32.906
Joe and Iused to do that.

01:03:32.948 --> 01:03:34.406
Joe's a good man.

01:03:35.530 --> 01:03:37.240
Yeah, he is.

01:03:37.281 --> 01:03:38.365
We all thought

01:03:38.406 --> 01:03:40.198
you were destinedfor one another,

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:41.656
the whole town.

01:03:41.697 --> 01:03:43.114
Well, Ithought so too,

01:03:43.114 --> 01:03:44.989
but then he...

01:03:45.031 --> 01:03:46.198
broke up with me,

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.781
just like that.

01:03:47.781 --> 01:03:50.489
Ah yes,the "Dear Megan" letter.

01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:52.948
Joe told me about it.

01:03:52.989 --> 01:03:55.448
He came out to my housethe day he mailed it.

01:03:55.489 --> 01:03:57.697
Oh, he waspractically inconsolable.

01:03:57.739 --> 01:03:59.489
Inconsolable?

01:04:00.822 --> 01:04:01.948
He... he wrote me

01:04:01.989 --> 01:04:03.948
and told me he didn'twant to see me anymore.

01:04:03.948 --> 01:04:05.948
Your Joe was just a young man,

01:04:05.989 --> 01:04:07.989
but he was smart enough to know

01:04:08.031 --> 01:04:10.448
that he had to let you goand chase your dreams,

01:04:10.489 --> 01:04:12.822
and he was so afraidthat you'd resent him,

01:04:12.864 --> 01:04:15.281
so he tolda little white lie

01:04:15.323 --> 01:04:17.948
to make it easier for you.

01:04:17.948 --> 01:04:20.697
But I was justgoing off to college.

01:04:20.739 --> 01:04:22.781
We could have found a wayto make it work.

01:04:22.781 --> 01:04:25.323
Joe wanted to give youyour freedom,

01:04:25.365 --> 01:04:27.323
so he made a choice.

01:04:27.365 --> 01:04:29.948
Now, maybe you could havemade it work,

01:04:29.989 --> 01:04:32.614
and maybe not.

01:04:32.656 --> 01:04:34.281
And now it's too late.

01:04:34.323 --> 01:04:37.448
You have a special placein Joe's heart, Megan,

01:04:37.448 --> 01:04:40.198
and no matter what happensfrom this point forward,

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.489
you always will.

01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:46.198
A first loveis a forever love.

01:04:54.572 --> 01:04:57.697
Well, I had a lovely time.

01:04:57.739 --> 01:04:59.906
Me too.

01:04:59.948 --> 01:05:01.906
Frances...

01:05:01.948 --> 01:05:03.781
can I ask you a question?

01:05:03.781 --> 01:05:05.281
You want to knowwhat it's going to take

01:05:05.323 --> 01:05:07.365
to convince me to sell my houseto your company.

01:05:09.448 --> 01:05:12.198
Look around you.

01:05:13.489 --> 01:05:15.739
What do you see?

01:05:18.739 --> 01:05:20.073
Beauty.

01:05:20.114 --> 01:05:21.530
Peace.

01:05:21.572 --> 01:05:23.781
It really is a special place.

01:05:23.822 --> 01:05:24.906
Yes,

01:05:24.948 --> 01:05:26.822
and the plan that yourcompany has presented

01:05:26.864 --> 01:05:30.281
doesn't respect the beautyof this special place.

01:05:30.281 --> 01:05:32.614
Now, if you cancome up with a way

01:05:32.656 --> 01:05:34.822
to keep the beautyof this lake alive,

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:36.406
then maybe we can do business.

01:05:36.448 --> 01:05:38.781
But how?

01:05:38.781 --> 01:05:39.739
The plans are set.

01:05:39.781 --> 01:05:41.073
they have been for months.

01:05:41.114 --> 01:05:42.948
Put your heart into it.

01:05:42.948 --> 01:05:45.156
Goodbye.

01:05:46.073 --> 01:05:47.989
Bye.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.906
[cell phone vibrates]

01:05:57.781 --> 01:05:58.906
Hello?

01:05:58.948 --> 01:06:00.114
Megan, you need to come right away.

01:06:00.114 --> 01:06:01.781
Yeah, Flo'sbeen acting up again,

01:06:01.781 --> 01:06:03.073
and your dad's not around.

01:06:03.114 --> 01:06:04.281
Flo?

01:06:04.323 --> 01:06:05.572
The dishwasher!

01:06:05.614 --> 01:06:08.114
All right, I'll be right there.

01:06:08.114 --> 01:06:09.614
And maybe you should call Joe.

01:06:11.781 --> 01:06:13.448
Okay.

01:06:20.989 --> 01:06:23.948
Hey, Dottie, is it bad?

01:06:23.948 --> 01:06:25.781
Did you call Joe?

01:06:25.822 --> 01:06:28.697
No need to.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.031
Joe?

01:06:33.073 --> 01:06:35.739
Hey, Megs.

01:06:38.406 --> 01:06:40.114
Um...

01:06:43.073 --> 01:06:45.114
Megan... [clearing throat]

01:06:45.114 --> 01:06:46.448
we've known each othera long time...

01:06:48.530 --> 01:06:52.114
and when I saw youthe other day,

01:06:52.156 --> 01:06:54.114
when you bumped into mein the street,

01:06:54.114 --> 01:06:57.864
I needed to tell you that

01:06:57.906 --> 01:06:59.448
I felt something.

01:06:59.448 --> 01:07:01.031
Mmm.

01:07:02.281 --> 01:07:05.365
...and it made me realize

01:07:05.406 --> 01:07:09.031
that the feelingsI've had for you a long time ago

01:07:09.073 --> 01:07:10.614
have never gone away.

01:07:12.948 --> 01:07:14.989
Megan...

01:07:18.614 --> 01:07:20.239
I don't want to lose you again.

01:07:21.281 --> 01:07:22.448
And...

01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:23.490
[door opens]Megan?

01:07:27.448 --> 01:07:28.948
Philip?

01:07:28.989 --> 01:07:30.198
I was hopingyou'd be here.

01:07:32.031 --> 01:07:33.864
What are you doing here?

01:07:33.906 --> 01:07:35.948
I couldn't stand itany longer.

01:07:35.989 --> 01:07:37.073
I had to see you.

01:07:37.114 --> 01:07:40.864
Megan, honey,

01:07:40.906 --> 01:07:43.281
I don't know whatthe future holds for us,

01:07:43.281 --> 01:07:46.114
but I think we shouldchoose each other,

01:07:46.156 --> 01:07:49.198
and just figure it outas we go.

01:07:49.239 --> 01:07:51.781
So...

01:07:51.781 --> 01:07:54.365
Megan Anne Quinn...

01:07:56.697 --> 01:07:58.114
will you be my wife?

01:08:05.781 --> 01:08:07.448
Uh...

01:08:08.448 --> 01:08:09.323
Megan...

01:08:12.365 --> 01:08:14.697
I-I'm sorry.

01:08:14.739 --> 01:08:16.697
Congratulations.

01:08:19.948 --> 01:08:21.656
Joe, wait!

01:08:28.948 --> 01:08:31.822
Philip, please stand up.

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:40.448
I'll be back.

01:08:40.448 --> 01:08:41.490
Megan!

01:08:43.198 --> 01:08:44.906
Who's Joe?

01:08:50.323 --> 01:08:52.863
Joe, wait a second.

01:08:52.906 --> 01:08:54.323
Wait!

01:08:55.448 --> 01:08:58.365
You broke upwith me, remember?

01:08:58.406 --> 01:09:00.448
You wrote me a letter,and that was it.

01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:01.529
No explanation,

01:09:01.572 --> 01:09:03.822
and poof, and you weregone from my life.

01:09:03.863 --> 01:09:05.738
[sighs in exasperation]

01:09:05.781 --> 01:09:07.156
I thought we werebest friends, Joe.

01:09:07.198 --> 01:09:10.529
I thought we were goingto build a life together.

01:09:10.572 --> 01:09:13.156
I didn't want to standin the way of your dream.

01:09:13.198 --> 01:09:15.113
So you made a choice for me

01:09:15.113 --> 01:09:19.113
without even talking about it?

01:09:19.156 --> 01:09:20.448
I know why you did it, Joe.

01:09:20.448 --> 01:09:23.656
Frances told me.

01:09:23.697 --> 01:09:24.822
But you were wrong.

01:09:24.863 --> 01:09:27.448
We could havemade it work.

01:09:27.448 --> 01:09:30.031
We could have made it workbecause I loved you,

01:09:30.073 --> 01:09:31.448
and I know you loved me--

01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:32.822
Okay,all right.

01:09:32.863 --> 01:09:35.281
Go back inside, okay?

01:09:35.281 --> 01:09:38.113
Philip's waiting.

01:09:38.156 --> 01:09:39.323
Don't do this again.

01:09:39.365 --> 01:09:40.781
Don't push me away.

01:09:40.781 --> 01:09:42.781
We're living twodifferent lives, Megan.

01:09:42.781 --> 01:09:46.198
Your life is back in Chicagowith Philip.

01:09:46.238 --> 01:09:49.948
My life ishere with Lily.

01:09:49.988 --> 01:09:51.988
I guess I...

01:09:54.323 --> 01:09:57.822
I thought we couldget back what we once had.

01:10:04.156 --> 01:10:06.989
I don't knowwhat I was thinking.

01:10:07.031 --> 01:10:09.031

01:10:18.406 --> 01:10:21.989
Philip, we need to talk.

01:10:25.406 --> 01:10:26.365
All right, thanks!Come again!

01:10:26.406 --> 01:10:27.365
[man calls]:Thanks, Matt!

01:10:27.406 --> 01:10:28.406
[chuckling]:Yeah. See ya.

01:10:28.448 --> 01:10:30.198
Always a pleasure.

01:10:33.073 --> 01:10:35.614
Let me know when youget back to Chicago.

01:10:35.656 --> 01:10:37.240
You're a great guy.

01:10:49.156 --> 01:10:50.656
Ah.

01:10:50.697 --> 01:10:52.281
Seemed like a nice enough fella.

01:10:53.948 --> 01:10:54.781
[sighs heavily]

01:10:54.822 --> 01:10:56.114
We broke up.

01:10:56.156 --> 01:10:57.198
Well, good.

01:10:57.239 --> 01:10:58.614
Then I don't have to payfor the wedding.

01:11:00.448 --> 01:11:01.240
[chuckles]

01:11:01.281 --> 01:11:02.281
Come on, I'm kidding.

01:11:06.198 --> 01:11:07.781
You wanna talk about it?

01:11:07.781 --> 01:11:10.406
No, thank you.

01:11:10.448 --> 01:11:12.822
Dad, if you don'tneed me here,

01:11:12.864 --> 01:11:15.323
I think I'd like to go home.

01:11:15.365 --> 01:11:17.530
I need to start workingon my résumé.

01:11:17.572 --> 01:11:20.323
Sure, I thinkwe can manage somehow.

01:11:22.614 --> 01:11:24.114
Ooh, before you go,

01:11:24.114 --> 01:11:26.781
I was in the back officecleaning this morning,

01:11:26.781 --> 01:11:28.697
and I found this.

01:11:30.281 --> 01:11:31.198
What is it?

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:32.240
Have a look.

01:11:38.406 --> 01:11:40.240
Huh?

01:11:40.281 --> 01:11:41.822
Remember those?

01:11:41.864 --> 01:11:45.531
No, your mother was planningon making a new menu,

01:11:45.572 --> 01:11:47.656
and she wanted to useone of your drawings

01:11:47.697 --> 01:11:48.989
as the cover.

01:11:50.281 --> 01:11:51.448
Of course, she died

01:11:51.448 --> 01:11:54.406
before she could putthe plan into motion.

01:11:56.948 --> 01:11:59.448

Uh, don't mention it...

01:12:22.614 --> 01:12:23.948
I guess.

I've been tryingto reach you all morning.

No, what?

It's less than an hour away.

Why do you think I've beentrying to reach you all morning?

01:13:57.239 --> 01:13:59.614
Mr. St. Clair's on his way to Cedarvale right now,

01:13:59.656 --> 01:14:01.281

Oh, no.Okay, okay, I'm on it.

01:14:03.822 --> 01:14:05.572
Uh, I'll call you later.

01:14:05.614 --> 01:14:06.531
[beeping off]

01:14:08.281 --> 01:14:09.114
I'm heading out, Dad!

01:14:09.156 --> 01:14:10.781
Good luck!

01:14:22.406 --> 01:14:26.989
So, if you'll just signat the bottom...

01:14:27.031 --> 01:14:29.656
And what if I don'tsign, Mr. St. Clair?

01:14:29.697 --> 01:14:31.948
Mrs. Figgins...may I call you Frances?

01:14:31.948 --> 01:14:33.406
No.

01:14:34.448 --> 01:14:35.614
Mrs. Figgins,

01:14:35.656 --> 01:14:39.323
Stoneland Properties ownsall of the surrounding land,

01:14:39.365 --> 01:14:41.781
so there will be no more buyers.

01:14:41.822 --> 01:14:44.365
Now, if you continueto hold out,

01:14:44.406 --> 01:14:46.531
well, we'll be forcedto break ground

01:14:46.572 --> 01:14:48.656
on the portion of landthat we do own,

01:14:48.697 --> 01:14:49.948
and, unfortunately,

01:14:49.948 --> 01:14:52.323
it will getpretty noisy around here,

01:14:52.365 --> 01:14:55.948
and this is a sweetheartof a deal, Mrs. Figgins.

01:14:55.989 --> 01:14:57.614
But if we're forcedto delay much longer,

01:14:57.614 --> 01:14:59.697
it might notbe so sweet.

01:14:59.739 --> 01:15:03.156
Now, this really isthe only option.

01:15:09.031 --> 01:15:11.031
[car honks]

01:15:14.531 --> 01:15:15.948
Wait!

01:15:15.948 --> 01:15:17.031
Don't sign anything.

01:15:17.989 --> 01:15:18.948
Don't signanything.

01:15:18.989 --> 01:15:21.239
Ms. Quinn?

01:15:21.281 --> 01:15:22.114
What do you think you're doing?

01:15:22.114 --> 01:15:23.490
Just bear with me, please.

01:15:23.531 --> 01:15:24.822
Bear with you?

01:15:24.864 --> 01:15:27.739
No. No, you had your chance,and you missed your deadline.

01:15:27.781 --> 01:15:28.739
That's why I'm here.

01:15:28.781 --> 01:15:29.739
No,not yet.

01:15:29.781 --> 01:15:31.031
I still have...

01:15:31.073 --> 01:15:32.365
four minutes.

01:15:32.406 --> 01:15:33.406
No, Ms. Quinn,

01:15:33.448 --> 01:15:34.989
you no longer havenegotiating authority

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:35.906
on this project.

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:37.114
Now, a deal is on the table.

01:15:37.156 --> 01:15:39.239
On the table,perhaps,

01:15:39.281 --> 01:15:40.989
but the penis still in my hand.

01:15:41.031 --> 01:15:43.114
I want to hear what Meganhas come up with.

01:15:43.114 --> 01:15:45.614
Mrs. Figgins,the plans are all set.

01:15:45.614 --> 01:15:47.406
We're getting readyto break ground.

01:15:47.448 --> 01:15:48.490
It's really too latefor any changes.

01:15:48.531 --> 01:15:49.739
Excuse me,Mr. St. Clair,

01:15:49.781 --> 01:15:50.989
but Mrs. Figgins' property

01:15:51.031 --> 01:15:52.323
sits dead center

01:15:52.365 --> 01:15:53.614
of the proposeddevelopment.

01:15:53.656 --> 01:15:54.781
Without her land,

01:15:54.781 --> 01:15:56.448
there's no waythe local planning commission

01:15:56.490 --> 01:15:57.864
will ever approve the project,

01:15:57.906 --> 01:15:58.822
and if she'snot budging,

01:15:58.864 --> 01:15:59.739
we don'thave a choice

01:15:59.781 --> 01:16:01.073
but to look atother options.

01:16:01.114 --> 01:16:02.281
Not budging?

01:16:02.323 --> 01:16:04.240
She was about to signbefore you got here.

01:16:04.281 --> 01:16:06.614
Well, now I've hada sudden change of heart.

01:16:13.614 --> 01:16:16.156
I want to hearwhat Megan has come up with.

01:16:21.114 --> 01:16:22.031
This better be good.

01:16:24.739 --> 01:16:25.531
Okay.

01:16:25.572 --> 01:16:26.948
Last night,

01:16:26.989 --> 01:16:28.073
I was thinkingthis whole thing over,

01:16:28.114 --> 01:16:29.948
and I realizedthat Frances is not being

01:16:29.948 --> 01:16:31.864
at all unreasonable.

01:16:31.906 --> 01:16:33.031
Of course not.

01:16:33.073 --> 01:16:34.948
All she wantsis to ensure

01:16:34.948 --> 01:16:36.531
that this stunninglybeautiful place,

01:16:36.572 --> 01:16:38.531
where she's spenther entire life,

01:16:38.572 --> 01:16:39.572
remains that way,

01:16:39.614 --> 01:16:41.948
and I think thatwith a little creativity,

01:16:41.948 --> 01:16:43.406
we can both get what we want.

01:16:43.448 --> 01:16:45.781
We can builda profitable development

01:16:45.822 --> 01:16:47.614
that respects the environment.

01:16:47.656 --> 01:16:49.406
Interesting.

01:16:55.323 --> 01:16:58.781
No, no, no, no, no,this is far too much green.

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:00.781
Are these trails?

01:17:00.822 --> 01:17:02.448
These treesare all supposed to be removed.

01:17:02.448 --> 01:17:03.656
But theydon't have to be.

01:17:03.697 --> 01:17:05.948
I've adjusted the footprintof the development,

01:17:05.989 --> 01:17:08.323
but the square footageremains exactly the same.

01:17:08.365 --> 01:17:12.073
I've arranged the restaurants

01:17:12.114 --> 01:17:14.781
so they getthe best views of the lake,

01:17:14.781 --> 01:17:16.948
and I sketched ingreen footpaths

01:17:16.989 --> 01:17:18.948
from the parking structureto the retail area,

01:17:18.989 --> 01:17:20.448
and I put ina playscape for kids

01:17:20.448 --> 01:17:22.114
by the water.

01:17:22.156 --> 01:17:24.114
I think we can makethis development

01:17:24.114 --> 01:17:25.989
a place where customerswant to linger,

01:17:26.031 --> 01:17:28.573
and if we can do that,

01:17:28.614 --> 01:17:30.114
they'll wantto come back,

01:17:30.156 --> 01:17:31.323
and in the long run,

01:17:31.365 --> 01:17:32.864
if we create a space

01:17:32.906 --> 01:17:33.948
that peoplewant to return to

01:17:33.948 --> 01:17:35.781
again and again,

01:17:35.781 --> 01:17:37.531
that means bigger profits.

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:42.448
I'm really proud of you.

01:17:42.448 --> 01:17:44.490
You have done a beautiful job.

01:17:46.822 --> 01:17:48.614
Just to be clear, Mrs. Figgins,

01:17:48.614 --> 01:17:49.781
you're saying

01:17:49.822 --> 01:17:51.822
that if we go with this plan,

01:17:51.864 --> 01:17:53.989
you might consentto selling your property?

01:17:54.031 --> 01:17:54.822
Yes.

01:17:54.864 --> 01:17:57.114
I could bepersuaded.

01:17:57.156 --> 01:17:58.864
I'm not against development,Mr. St. Clair.

01:17:58.906 --> 01:18:00.656
It just has to bethe right kind.

01:18:06.198 --> 01:18:08.073
Okay, Ms. Quinn.

01:18:09.448 --> 01:18:11.822
Get these plans onthe drawing board.

01:18:11.864 --> 01:18:13.323
