14:10.432 --> 14:12.059
How does he show
he hates you?

14:12.059 --> 14:14.562
(Groans)

14:17.147 --> 14:21.360
Rosie. Rosie,
we know this is
upsetting for you.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.404
But for us
to do something...

14:23.404 --> 14:29.076
about what's happening between
your mom and Zeke and you,
we need your cooperation.

14:33.247 --> 14:36.876
Honey, I know how you feel.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.379
Let us help you.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.841
(Sighs)

14:50.014 --> 14:52.391
He put his thing in me,
and I'm sick.

14:54.143 --> 14:57.146
<i>-(Sniffling)</i>
-Okay.

15:01.483 --> 15:06.405
I don't feel good.
I want to go to the bathroom.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.157
<i>You go ahead, honey.</i>
(Crying)

15:11.827 --> 15:16.999
There's no question in my mind,
uh, this isn't her just looking
to help her mother's story.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.460
No. Sh-Sh-She don't
come across
plottin' like that.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.254
What people turn sex into.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.465
-ROSIE: Mom!
-WOMAN:
Help! Carla!

15:24.465 --> 15:26.967
What is it, Ma?
<i>WOMAN:</i>
<i>She's sick!</i>

15:26.967 --> 15:29.178
<i>CARLA:</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Oh, my God, baby.</i>

15:29.178 --> 15:31.889
GREG:
My God, what's going on?

15:31.889 --> 15:35.142
All right.
It just came out of me.

15:35.142 --> 15:37.353
-What happened?
W-Was she pregnant?
-Call an ambulance.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.396
-My God.
<i>-CARLA:</i>
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

15:39.396 --> 15:41.941
-Greg, call an ambulance.
-Yeah. All right.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.901
Uh, 15th Squad
to Central K.

15:43.901 --> 15:47.446
Uh, uh, have an ambulance
respond to 26 28th Avenue.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.999
(Clears Throat)

15:58.999 --> 16:01.919
-Just throw 'em
on the desk here, guys.
<i>-Okay.</i>

16:01.919 --> 16:04.380
-<i>SIPOWICZ: Thanks.</i>
-No problem.

16:04.380 --> 16:07.675
Got these out of
the motel Dumpster
those two skells stayed at.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.511
-All Spanish people I.D.'s.
-Yeah, they gotta be
from that stickup.

16:10.511 --> 16:13.138
A receipt for takeout
delivered to the room
they were in.

16:13.138 --> 16:15.808
It was in the same bag
with the rest of
the stolen I.D.'s.

16:15.808 --> 16:20.187
Plus, these idiots,
they send flowers
to their moms.

16:20.187 --> 16:22.940
I got one of
the moms coming in
behind a phony story.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.984
Pretty impressive work, Andy.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.277
<i>Hey, I finished with</i>
<i>the stickup witnesses, Andy.</i>

16:27.277 --> 16:30.698
The ones that didn't have their
heads down made the, uh,
brown-haired guy the shooter.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.700
One of 'em's mother's
coming in.

16:32.700 --> 16:36.245
Yeah. Probably, uh,
want to wash up before
you talk to her, hmm?

16:36.245 --> 16:38.747
What? You figure
you'd smell like petunias,
Martinez, huh?

16:38.747 --> 16:42.167
Rummaging around
in some scummy Dumpster?

16:42.167 --> 16:44.128
-Where's Bobby?
-(Sighs, Clears Throat)

16:44.128 --> 16:47.798
He had to take some lost time.
Otherwise, he was
desperate to stay.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.605
Joseph Salvo.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.649
-Appreciate you coming,
Bobby.
-What's up?

17:05.649 --> 17:08.652
I just want to say beforehand,
if you can't do this,
it's no problem whatsoever.

17:08.652 --> 17:10.904
So, please,
don't take it wrong.

17:10.904 --> 17:14.116
We're both 21.
(Chuckles)
Yeah, just barely.

17:15.826 --> 17:18.454
I got a plate number
I'd like you to
run for me, Bobby,

17:18.454 --> 17:20.664
which I know is
an awkward request.

17:20.664 --> 17:22.666
I'm not gonna ask you why,
Joey,

17:22.666 --> 17:25.544
because I'm not supposed
to be running plates for
civilians no matter what.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.713
I understand 100%.

17:27.713 --> 17:32.509
And, uh, I'm not
gonna insult you
by offering you anything,

17:32.509 --> 17:36.096
but I would like to give you
a case of what is called
single malt scotch whiskey,

17:36.096 --> 17:39.224
which--well, they tell me
it's a really expensive type.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.852
But I'm telling you,
it's lost on me anyway,
'cause I drink tequila shooters.

17:44.104 --> 17:48.192
It happens that I enjoy
a drink of scotch.

17:48.192 --> 17:53.947
I'd like you to have that,
despite what you said--
and with no connections.

17:53.947 --> 17:57.576
If I did this,
I wouldn't want it
to be a habit, Joey.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.828
Make this scotch a habit,
you'd never show up for work.

17:59.828 --> 18:02.372
I'm talking about
running the plate.

18:04.500 --> 18:09.421
If you're willing to do this,
I would absolutely
not make it a habit.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.090
And I'd deeply
appreciate it.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.304
So, it's in the trunk, huh?
The scotch?

18:17.304 --> 18:19.807
Plate number's in marker
on the outside of the case...

18:19.807 --> 18:21.809
underneath
"Product of Scotland."

18:21.809 --> 18:25.062
-You want to walk away from
your car for a few minutes?
<i>- Absolutely.</i>

18:36.073 --> 18:38.617
<i>Know what it does, being got</i>
<i>to the hospital off a lie?</i>

18:38.617 --> 18:40.869
Sorry for
the confusion, Zeke.

18:40.869 --> 18:45.040
Tell a man a loved one's been in
a traffic accident, so she can
charge him with assault.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.792
Yeah, you were
so much in anguish...

18:46.792 --> 18:49.628
you showed up two hours late
with half a load on.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.547
-Okay, Greg.
-I got lost.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.632
You're a lying prick.

18:55.592 --> 18:57.928
What's wrong
with Rosie anyway?

18:57.928 --> 19:00.222
Shut your mouth, Zeke.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.641
Doctor said it was
some kind of appendix problem.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.018
-Josh, stow Zeke
in the pokey?
-Sure.

19:05.018 --> 19:07.980
Thanks.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.108
(Clears Throat)
Lieu, uh, that's
the complainant's boyfriend.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.318
Thinks he's in just
for the assault on her.

19:13.318 --> 19:16.113
-Doctor confirmed
a miscarriage?
<i>-MEDAVOY: Fetus was 14 weeks.</i>

19:16.113 --> 19:20.033
Prospective mother's in shock.
You should've seen
what she went through.

19:20.033 --> 19:23.245
Bloody hemorrhaging,
terrible pain and cramps.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.581
We got her preliminary
before she lost the baby.

19:25.581 --> 19:28.208
-I don't want to ask her
for any more right now.
-Go with what you got.

19:28.208 --> 19:31.461
-Mm-hmm.
-I'd like to take the squad,
line 'em up,

19:31.461 --> 19:34.423
and take turns
on this guy with
a Louisville Slugger.

19:34.423 --> 19:37.467
-Uh, we'll probably just start
with a conversation.
-Yeah.

19:37.467 --> 19:39.720
No, of course.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.023
I'm Mrs. Mary Mosler.
I was informed to come in.

19:51.023 --> 19:54.193
I'm Detective Sipowicz.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.820
-You left me a message.
-Mm-hmm. Come here.
Have a seat.

20:01.283 --> 20:04.995
-This is Mrs. Mosler.
Detective Simone.
-How do you do?

20:04.995 --> 20:07.664
What's it about?
Why'd you want to see me?

20:07.664 --> 20:10.209
-Well, your name's come up
in an investigation.
-How can that be?

20:10.209 --> 20:13.295
We're looking at
a florist named O'Hara.

20:13.295 --> 20:17.132
They got records showing
a delivery of flowers
to you this morning.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.551
-Was that delivery made?
-Yeah. They were
from my son, Jimmy.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.762
Is something wrong?

20:21.762 --> 20:25.807
We're checking this florist,
O'Hara's, records. Uh, where-
where's this Jimmy live?

20:25.807 --> 20:28.769
Oh, dear.
I-I don't know his address.

20:28.769 --> 20:32.689
H-He's in a kind of period
now, you know. He-He's just
sort of temporary.

20:32.689 --> 20:33.857
Would you call that
cooperation?

20:35.150 --> 20:37.277
W-We're at a point here,
Mrs. Mosler,

20:37.277 --> 20:39.363
where we need pretty
specific cooperation...

20:39.363 --> 20:43.242
in terms of
who's cooperating in this
investigation and who isn't.

20:43.242 --> 20:47.287
<i>This florist, O'Hara,</i>
<i>he's had dealings with</i>
<i>a person named Frankie.</i>

20:47.287 --> 20:50.582
His last name might be
Lankersheim. Are you familiar
with that person?

20:50.582 --> 20:53.794
Yeah, I-I-I do think
I met him once.
I can't say as I liked him.

20:53.794 --> 20:56.797
-How often does your son
stay in touch with you?
<i>-What has this florist done?</i>

20:56.797 --> 21:00.467
-I-I don't see the connection.
-So, you prefer
not to cooperate?

21:00.467 --> 21:03.804
<i>Well--Did Jimmy buy</i>
<i>these flowers with a--</i>
<i>with a stolen credit card?</i>

21:03.804 --> 21:05.806
Are he and O'Hara
in some kind of ring?

21:05.806 --> 21:08.433
Mrs. Mosler, the best course
for you right here...

21:08.433 --> 21:10.936
is to think real hard
where Jimmy might be staying at.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.146
Jimmy does have a kind of
girlfriend, Terry.

21:13.146 --> 21:15.857
He stays with her sometimes.
She drinks.

21:15.857 --> 21:20.028
What can you do?
I'm just his mother.

21:20.028 --> 21:22.364
Do you know her last name
or where she might live?

21:22.364 --> 21:25.450
-Oh, I have a phone number.
-We appreciate your help.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.586
(Scoffs)
Oh, I hope Jimmy's all right.

21:36.586 --> 21:39.965
I got a funny feeling
when I got those flowers,
something might be going wrong.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.384
Jimmy never gave me flowers
in his whole life.

21:46.680 --> 21:50.684
<i>Zeke, ask yourself what</i>
<i>a jury's gonna think about</i>
<i>a guy who's done what you have,</i>

21:50.684 --> 21:52.936
gives no indication
of remorse.

21:54.187 --> 21:56.231
You listen to me.

21:56.231 --> 21:59.109
I love my family.

21:59.109 --> 22:02.195
I would never do anything
to hurt Carla or Rosie.

22:02.195 --> 22:05.699
Lying scumbag.
You beat your wife
plain as day.

22:05.699 --> 22:08.285
I want my own children,
all right?

22:08.285 --> 22:13.415
<i>Which Carla won't let</i>
<i>that happen till she says</i>
<i>I'm... straightened out.</i>

22:13.415 --> 22:16.209
<i>That's a frustration,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

22:16.209 --> 22:21.923
And maybe I reacted on
Carla in the wrong way.

22:21.923 --> 22:24.426
You admit
you struck Carla?

22:24.426 --> 22:30.474
I might have, uh,
acted in somewhat, uh,
anger and frustration.

22:30.474 --> 22:35.520
Mm-hmm. And part of
that frustration
was wanting kids.

22:35.520 --> 22:38.231
I want my own family,
and take care of them.
That's right.

22:38.231 --> 22:42.319
Did you get Rosie pregnant
because Carla
wouldn't give you that?

22:42.319 --> 22:44.321
Pregnant?
<i>Pregnant, Zeke.</i>

22:44.321 --> 22:45.947
That's right.

22:47.532 --> 22:50.577
-Is that what she's
in the hospital for?
-Rosie?

22:50.577 --> 22:53.830
-She's in the hospital
for appendicitis.
-So the baby's all right?

22:53.830 --> 22:57.250
I want to know the truth
about your relationship
with Rosie, Zeke.

22:57.250 --> 23:01.129
'Cause she's not
my real daughter,
she could have that baby.

23:01.129 --> 23:03.548
<i>It wouldn't be illegal.</i>
Not your real daughter?

23:03.548 --> 23:06.635
Like that makes a difference,
you sick piece of garbage?

23:06.635 --> 23:10.889
I think we ought to give Zeke
a few minutes to himself, Greg.

23:10.889 --> 23:14.726
You think about telling us
the truth. We'll decide
if we can work this out.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.911
(Sighs)

23:32.911 --> 23:36.790
Greg, get past
your hard-on about this guy,
or I don't want you in there.

23:36.790 --> 23:39.418
Sorry. Uh, I apologize.

23:39.418 --> 23:43.547
I-I-I'm bringing
personal baggage, uh,
reference to pregnancy just now.

23:43.547 --> 23:46.133
And I am about a mother
being beaten, and a father
getting over on his daughter.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.343
So are we gonna
play personal baggage...

23:48.343 --> 23:51.179
or move this asshole
off his proud
paternal feelings?

23:51.179 --> 23:53.598
Uh, w-we're gonna move him.
Point taken.
(Chuckles)

23:53.598 --> 23:55.642
All right.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.914
(Sighs)

24:19.541 --> 24:21.501
You sure you got
the right Jimmy Mosler?

24:21.501 --> 24:23.587
I'm not gonna tell you
the computer's
never been wrong.

24:23.587 --> 24:25.672
<i>ZEKE:</i>
<i>When am I gonna</i>
<i>get outta here?</i>

24:25.672 --> 24:28.592
That guy committed a crime
in there, huh?

24:28.592 --> 24:30.594
Yeah. We get those
occasionally.

24:30.594 --> 24:33.346
Come on.
We'll talk about your possible
mistaken identity in here.

24:33.346 --> 24:35.223
Sit down.

24:36.933 --> 24:39.519
Give us your
whereabouts 2:30
this morning, Jimmy.

24:39.519 --> 24:42.481
Bed with my girlfriend.
That Terry,
where we just picked you up?

24:42.481 --> 24:45.692
-Right.
-Is she gonna back you
being in bed with her, Jimmy?

24:45.692 --> 24:49.279
'Cause we're
gonna make Terry understand
that if she is lying here,

24:49.279 --> 24:52.365
that's gonna put her
right in the middle
of a capital offense.

24:52.365 --> 24:54.910
-Who I was with last night?
<i>-SIPOWICZ:</i>
<i>Last night, yeah.</i>

24:54.910 --> 24:56.620
That isn't Terry.
That's another one.

24:56.620 --> 24:59.581
Oh, yeah.
What's her name?

24:59.581 --> 25:01.833
One-night stand.
We didn't get to names.
Wham, bam. Thank you, ma'am.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.919
Yeah, I never got
her name from her.

25:03.919 --> 25:07.297
Well, you see, my thinking here,
Jimmy, is your only
quick pop last night...

25:07.297 --> 25:10.884
-was shooting up
the Ecuador Club.
-No, I was getting laid.

25:10.884 --> 25:14.012
Eyewitnesses put you there
sticking up that club at 2:30
last night, Jimmy,

25:14.012 --> 25:16.264
and killing three people!

25:16.264 --> 25:19.726
Plus, we took
a garbage bag filled
with the victims' wallets...

25:19.726 --> 25:23.772
out of a Dumpster at
that outhouse motel
that you were staying at...

25:23.772 --> 25:26.650
till you checked out
this morning
with your partner, Jimmy.

25:26.650 --> 25:28.860
All the evidence
is landed on you like a safe.

25:28.860 --> 25:31.196
I am innocent of shooting
a single person in that place!

25:31.196 --> 25:36.159
<i>Jimmy, we got evidence</i>
<i>right down to the flowers...</i>

25:36.159 --> 25:38.912
that you sent your mom
off of one of them
dead people's credit cards.

25:38.912 --> 25:42.415
It wasn't me that shot 'em.
I never shot my gun.
Who then? Frankie?

25:42.415 --> 25:45.043
Frankie went out of orbit.
What happened?
Was he on dope?

25:45.043 --> 25:47.295
First off,
these were foreign people.

25:47.295 --> 25:51.299
They couldn't even understand
what we were telling them
to do. It was all screwed up.

25:51.299 --> 25:55.220
It's hell to rob
that many people.
You can't watch 'em all.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.932
You can't control 'em.
You're completely stressed out.
They couldn't do nothing right.

25:58.932 --> 26:02.227
And with Frankie--
He had been doing blow,

26:02.227 --> 26:05.897
and a group of 'em,
three different times, couldn't
comply with what he's saying.

26:05.897 --> 26:09.901
And finally he just goes nuts,

didn't even get all the money!

26:09.901 --> 26:12.112
Well, you both must've been
so frustrated afterward.

26:12.112 --> 26:14.364
Look, Jimmy,
we can work with the D.A....

26:14.364 --> 26:18.368

on these murder charges, if
you give us where Frankie's at.

26:18.368 --> 26:21.037
I'll give him to you
on a silver platter,
only I don't know.

26:21.037 --> 26:23.999
He called me from a bar
just before you showed up.

26:23.999 --> 26:28.253
-I didn't want to talk 'cause
my girlfriend was in the room.
-What bar was it?

26:28.253 --> 26:30.005
-He didn't say.
<i>-SIMONE:</i>

26:30.005 --> 26:32.048

26:34.050 --> 26:36.595
You mean you got the number?

26:36.595 --> 26:39.389
Yeah, I wrote it down.

26:43.893 --> 26:48.356
Try providing
the information we're seekin'
as quick as possible, Jimmy!

26:48.356 --> 26:50.817
'Cause you got
a very irritable personality.

26:50.817 --> 26:53.612
JIMMY:
Here's something.

26:53.612 --> 26:58.366
Frankie's got my gun.
I gave it to him.
He threw his away.

26:58.366 --> 27:00.952
See, now, that could be of help.
We appreciate that.

27:00.952 --> 27:03.413
Yeah. Thanks.

27:05.165 --> 27:08.335

up Frankie now.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.731
<i>There were some developments.</i>

27:33.234 --> 27:35.612
What developed?

27:35.612 --> 27:40.200
Appendicitis wasn't
the right diagnosis.
Rosie had a baby.

27:40.200 --> 27:43.119
-You're kidding.
-Mmm.

27:43.119 --> 27:47.248
-She had a baby?
<i>-MEDAVOY:</i>
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

27:47.248 --> 27:49.751
It's real small.
It's in an incubator,
but it's alive.

27:49.751 --> 27:52.796
-What kind?
-It's a boy.

27:52.796 --> 27:55.590
<i>I wouldn't spend much time</i>
<i>denying you're the father,</i>
<i>Zeke.</i>

27:55.590 --> 27:58.176

it looks like you.
It has your eyes.

28:01.054 --> 28:04.474
-(Sighs)
It's a boy, huh?
<i>-RUSSELL: Yeah.</i>

28:04.474 --> 28:06.726
Is Rosie okay?

28:06.726 --> 28:08.728
Naturally, she was in
a lot of pain.

28:08.728 --> 28:11.690
-Is-Is she gonna be
all right?
-She'll survive.

28:11.690 --> 28:15.902
But the doctor said,
psychologically, she's facing
a lifetime of troubles.

28:15.902 --> 28:20.115
I swear to God,
I'd never hurt her.

28:21.825 --> 28:25.829
I'll do what I can
to support her emotions.

28:25.829 --> 28:31.418
Zeke, if having a baby
was all you really wanted,
Carla wasn't cooperating,

28:31.418 --> 28:34.754
your job's to bring that
across to an impartial jury.

28:37.090 --> 28:41.845
Family has always been
the most important thing.

28:41.845 --> 28:44.055
That's what you've
got to bring across...

28:44.055 --> 28:46.850
where other people
might see sexual abuse
of a 12-year-old.

28:46.850 --> 28:49.394
You've got to take
responsibility to make
your further point.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.604
Otherwise, the jury's thinking,

28:51.604 --> 28:53.773
"What kind of a father
doesn't stand up
and take responsibility?

28:53.773 --> 28:56.067
<i>One that's half-assed."</i>

29:00.697 --> 29:02.574
Will I ever
get to see the baby?

29:02.574 --> 29:05.410
Don't count on the judge
doing you any favors...

29:05.410 --> 29:07.996
without some kind of
written explanation
of your actions.

29:10.832 --> 29:14.794
I want to explain
why I did what I did.

29:16.045 --> 29:18.798

We're the police.
You wanna come

30:30.161 --> 30:33.248
-No, I got nothing
to do with it.
-Up and out.

30:35.416 --> 30:38.461

-Hey, Greg.
-Pick up the second shooter?

I'm not gonna fire blanks.

You already got two kids.

31:13.621 --> 31:17.375
-I'm saying regards

-Oh.

I feel like a moron

31:26.301 --> 31:29.178

31:29.178 --> 31:32.557
Hey, Greg, you still know
how to ride a bike, right?

31:34.851 --> 31:37.520
That weapon was purchased
from a Harris Blake...

31:37.520 --> 31:40.023
outside the New York City
Port Authority Bus Terminal.

31:40.023 --> 31:42.567
Not by me,
but by Jimmy Mosler.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.694
I was holding it for him
for his protection.

31:44.694 --> 31:46.696
So what was this, Frankie?
Some kind of hate crime?

31:46.696 --> 31:48.948
'Cause that's the way
this whole thing
is shapin' up.

31:48.948 --> 31:54.120
That's wrong as hell! I didn't
shoot nobody, and I got nothing

31:56.080 --> 31:59.751

31:59.751 --> 32:01.961

32:01.961 --> 32:04.923

32:04.923 --> 32:07.425

-How'd you do?

41:35.534 --> 41:39.121
(Scoffs)
You must've given me
the wrong plate number, Joey.

41:39.121 --> 41:42.541
-I don't think so.
-The plate comes up "no hit."

41:43.792 --> 41:45.211
Don't register.

41:47.713 --> 41:49.507
That's the right plate.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.842
Can I have that back?

41:54.887 --> 41:57.515
Appreciate the help, Bobby.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.767
What? For telling you
a plate don't exist?

41:59.767 --> 42:03.312
Hey, Bobby, I think we both know
"no hit" could also mean
covered license plate, right?

42:03.312 --> 42:09.151
Car's being used
in an investigation?
Yeah, that could be too.

42:11.111 --> 42:13.864
I appreciate what you did,
and I appreciate how you did it.

42:13.864 --> 42:16.534
All right, Joey.
One for old times, huh?

42:16.534 --> 42:20.746
Enjoy the scotch.
Maybe we get some
new times going, huh?

42:39.223 --> 42:41.267
<i>-Hey.</i>
-Hi, Greg.

42:43.978 --> 42:46.689
I think there's
a pretty good amount
of semen in there.

42:46.689 --> 42:49.066
-That's great.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

42:49.066 --> 42:51.151
Uh, the doctor'd be
better able to compare,

42:51.151 --> 42:54.154
but i-it seems like
there's a pretty good amount.

42:54.154 --> 42:56.365
-<i>Hey, Greg.</i>
-Hello, Abby.

42:56.365 --> 42:58.617
Greg did fine.

42:58.617 --> 43:02.830
Yeah. I thought of a pun
on the way over--

43:02.830 --> 43:04.999
-Emission accomplished.
-(Chuckles)

43:06.542 --> 43:08.836
Anyways.

43:08.836 --> 43:10.879
Come here.
(Kisses)

43:15.134 --> 43:21.056
I pray our baby will be
as sweet as you,
and gentle, and good.

43:23.309 --> 43:26.937
We are so honored
that you'll be his father.

43:32.568 --> 43:36.947
Thank you very much,
Abby. Kathy.

43:39.408 --> 43:42.578
-We gotta get in.
-Absolutely.

43:47.333 --> 43:49.543
The baton's been passed.
