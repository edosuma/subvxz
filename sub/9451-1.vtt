02:10.398 --> 02:11.999
There it is.

02:12.066 --> 02:14.134
- Real big.
- Mm.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.439
Want to go in first?

02:18.506 --> 02:20.908
- Really?
- l don't see why not.

02:27.482 --> 02:29.183
Are you coming?

02:40.996 --> 02:42.197
So?

02:44.365 --> 02:46.100
So what?

02:47.735 --> 02:49.937
So what do you-- what do you think?

02:51.672 --> 02:53.807
You already know what l think.

02:55.777 --> 02:57.845
l did it, Dad!

02:57.912 --> 02:59.513
That's great.

03:43.958 --> 03:45.959
__

03:47.228 --> 03:48.329
Lou!

05:03.571 --> 05:05.306
They're here!

05:08.309 --> 05:11.011
- Dad, we don't have any milk.
- l know. I'm sorry.

05:11.078 --> 05:14.214
l didn't realize
that no one in town delivers.

05:14.282 --> 05:15.583
Hmm?

05:15.650 --> 05:18.219
And you forgot Marmalade's litter box.

05:18.286 --> 05:22.256
I'll go into town tomorrow,
and I'll pick one up.

05:22.323 --> 05:23.557
Uhh!

05:27.361 --> 05:28.428
Uhh!

05:28.496 --> 05:29.697
No, thank you.

05:30.765 --> 05:32.066
I'm finished.

05:37.305 --> 05:40.107
We're finished.

05:45.379 --> 05:46.480
Well...

05:48.316 --> 05:50.117
girls don't like jerky.

05:50.185 --> 05:51.553
Mm-mm.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.121
For dinner.

05:54.189 --> 05:55.223
Uhh!

06:13.908 --> 06:16.377
You going to unpack tomorrow, hon?

06:16.444 --> 06:19.280
How are you going to do this?

06:19.347 --> 06:20.781
Do what?

06:20.848 --> 06:24.952
Be our father.
You don't have much practice.

06:25.019 --> 06:27.821
l guess, um...

06:27.888 --> 06:29.990
l guess we'll find out.

06:34.729 --> 06:36.464
What are you writing?

06:38.966 --> 06:41.001
A letter to Mom.

06:41.068 --> 06:45.071
"Thanks for abandoning us.
You're a slut,

06:45.139 --> 06:47.774
and your new boyfriend is a shit head."

06:49.944 --> 06:51.245
Well...

06:53.614 --> 06:57.417
l agree with, uh, the second part.

06:58.819 --> 07:01.188
Did you ever even love her?

07:02.523 --> 07:03.924
Excuse me?

07:03.991 --> 07:06.593
You didn't do anything. You let her go.

07:06.661 --> 07:09.196
She made a decision, Louisa, okay?
l couldn't stop her.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.198
But if you cared enough, you would have.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.634
There was nothing l could do, honey.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.969
And your mother--

07:16.037 --> 07:17.705
your mother isn't a slut.

07:17.772 --> 07:19.006
Fine.

07:19.073 --> 07:22.376
l don't want you using that word anymore.

07:22.443 --> 07:24.611
Fine.

07:24.679 --> 07:26.113
Fine.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.426
Can l come in?

07:39.493 --> 07:40.794
Mm-hmm.

07:45.232 --> 07:46.666
Wow.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.136
You, uh...

07:50.204 --> 07:52.306
you really did some work in here.

07:52.373 --> 07:53.674
All by myself.

07:53.741 --> 07:56.376
Yeah. All by yourself.

07:56.444 --> 07:59.313
That's great. Thank you.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.649
Louisa doesn't like it here.

08:02.717 --> 08:04.151
Yeah.

08:06.220 --> 08:08.322
What about you?

08:08.389 --> 08:10.758
l like it if you like it.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.496
l think it'll be good for us.

08:15.563 --> 08:18.666
Is Mommy going to visit?

08:22.069 --> 08:26.106
Maybe, if she saw
how much work l did unpacking,

08:26.173 --> 08:27.607
she might.

08:29.378 --> 08:31.613
Maybe you'll see her for Christmas.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.948
- Okay? Good night.
- Good night.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.456
Daddy?

08:42.523 --> 08:43.724
Daddy!

08:45.192 --> 08:46.359
Yeah?

08:46.427 --> 08:48.729
You have to leave the door open a little.

08:48.796 --> 08:49.863
Oh.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.867
Sorry.

08:53.934 --> 08:57.904
Daddy's, uh, forgetting a lot lately, huh?

09:00.808 --> 09:03.143
- Good night.
- Good night.

10:09.477 --> 10:12.780
You excited about
your first day of school tomorrow?

10:14.181 --> 10:15.482
Yep.

10:15.549 --> 10:17.350
You going to have some fun?

10:17.418 --> 10:18.452
Yep.

10:18.519 --> 10:20.320
Yeah. Good.

10:23.324 --> 10:24.858
Well, good morning.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.360
l couldn't sleep.

10:27.428 --> 10:30.464
It was too quiet, and it was too dark.

10:30.530 --> 10:32.865
This place sucks.

10:32.933 --> 10:35.402
Please don't use that word.

10:35.469 --> 10:38.939
- Doesn't mean what you think.
- l know what it means.

10:39.006 --> 10:42.809
Okay, then really, don't use it.

10:49.583 --> 10:52.018
What does sucks mean?

11:14.542 --> 11:16.510
John, how are the children?

11:16.576 --> 11:20.313
They're missing their mom,
but we're doing okay.

11:20.381 --> 11:23.150
l hope there will be
a good therapist there.

11:23.217 --> 11:24.284
Yeah.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.219
You never know
when your daughter needs one.

11:26.287 --> 11:29.256
Yeah, I'd say we're all
staring at some therapy.

11:29.323 --> 11:31.291
Well, anyway, how's the book coming?

11:31.358 --> 11:32.892
When are we going to see some changes?

11:32.960 --> 11:34.061
- The writing?
- Yeah.

11:34.128 --> 11:36.763
Well, the writing's, uh...
the writing's coming great.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.765
- Yeah, John?
- Yeah, it's coming great.

11:38.832 --> 11:42.168
l think I've already got
the first couple of chapters done.

11:52.513 --> 11:55.649
How about l call you in a couple of weeks
when l have something to show you?

11:55.716 --> 11:57.117
- Sounds good, John.
- Good.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.618
Bye.

11:58.686 --> 11:59.953
Huh.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.134
- Sam!
- l just found it.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.336
Sam, put that down!

12:16.403 --> 12:18.271
- Louisa--
- Daddy!

12:19.673 --> 12:20.840
Daddy!

12:20.908 --> 12:22.509
Sam, put that down.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.644
Louisa, l just found it.

12:24.712 --> 12:25.946
Sam!

12:28.148 --> 12:31.017
Point that at the ground.

12:31.085 --> 12:32.886
l need for you
to listen to me very carefully.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.154
Louisa, come on.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.323
l-- l was playing the piano.

12:36.390 --> 12:38.825
l want you to bend your knees, Sam.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.527
l want you to bend your knees

12:41.595 --> 12:44.965
and gently, gently lay that on the ground.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.633
- It was in there.

12:46.699 --> 12:48.534
Sam, that's all right.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.437
- That's okay.
- I'm going to tell--

12:50.504 --> 12:52.973
Everything's all right.
You're not in trouble.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.143
l want you to gently hand it to me.

12:59.546 --> 13:00.546
l--

13:04.785 --> 13:07.320
All right, all right. Hey. Hey.

13:11.025 --> 13:12.793
Am l grounded?

13:12.860 --> 13:14.228
Hmm?

13:14.294 --> 13:16.029
Am l grounded?

13:16.096 --> 13:19.466
No. You're not grounded.

13:19.533 --> 13:25.372
And even if you were, Sam,
it wouldn't make any deference.

13:25.439 --> 13:28.642
We're a hundred miles
from anyone you know.

13:29.709 --> 13:30.843
Not now.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.416
What are you going to do with it?

13:38.185 --> 13:40.153
Want to let me worry about that?

13:40.220 --> 13:41.854
Okay.

13:41.922 --> 13:45.091
Come on, Sam. Let's go exploring.

13:47.727 --> 13:49.095
Where?

13:49.163 --> 13:50.531
Everywhere.

13:56.270 --> 13:57.738
Come on.

14:05.079 --> 14:06.713
Wait up, Lou.

14:12.186 --> 14:14.788
- Oh!
- Be careful.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.695
What the fuck?

14:21.761 --> 14:24.230
- Look at that.
- Whoa!

14:47.121 --> 14:50.624
Hey, it was loaded, all right?
It was loaded.

14:50.691 --> 14:51.758
Okay, John.

14:51.824 --> 14:54.059
Nobody got hurt, right?
l am sorry about that.

14:54.128 --> 14:56.797
l thought you might want to,
you know, contact the seller,

14:56.863 --> 14:59.565
let him know that he left a piano
loaded with a shotgun

14:59.633 --> 15:01.434
for my T-year-old to find.

15:01.502 --> 15:03.737
- Wow. You got a piano.
- Yeah.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.070
right. Well, thank you, John.

15:05.139 --> 15:07.274
Okay, Stewart. Thank you very much.

15:07.341 --> 15:08.775
l am sorry about all this.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.681
Putz.

15:16.784 --> 15:19.720
- Lou?
- Yeah.

15:19.787 --> 15:22.789
Does Mommy not love us anymore?

15:22.855 --> 15:26.291
No, Sam. Mom still loves us.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.795
Did l do something?

15:28.861 --> 15:30.262
No.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.931
Did Daddy?

15:34.368 --> 15:35.836
No.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.672
What is that, Lou?

16:47.674 --> 16:49.342
l don't know.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.612
Louisa?

17:02.021 --> 17:03.889
Dad.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.624
We found something.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.266
Are you coming?

17:13.333 --> 17:15.401
Yep.

17:15.469 --> 17:16.903
It-- It's outside.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.137
Yeah? We going to need jackets?

17:30.817 --> 17:32.451
What is it, Daddy?

17:35.322 --> 17:36.690
l don't know.

17:36.757 --> 17:40.060
The Realtor never said
anything about it.

17:40.127 --> 17:43.296
Doesn't seem to be any sign
of a tractor dig or--

17:43.363 --> 17:45.498
Feels old.

17:45.565 --> 17:49.835
Sam, come up here.
l can almost see my window.

17:52.940 --> 17:55.175
It's all right.

17:55.242 --> 17:56.743
Come on.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.248
No.

18:01.315 --> 18:04.351
l-- l don't want to.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.620
Whatever.

18:08.622 --> 18:09.956
Okay.

18:10.022 --> 18:12.991
You can walk with me.
l don't want to go up there, either.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.755
Marmalade. Marmalade.

19:49.823 --> 19:51.424
Oh.

19:55.562 --> 19:56.696
Marmalade.

20:13.914 --> 20:15.048
Marmalade?

20:18.117 --> 20:19.418
Marmalade.

21:12.005 --> 21:13.706
Here, Sam.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.775
- What's that?
- Lunch.

21:16.843 --> 21:21.514
You forgot to do it.
You were too busy losing Marmalade.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.282
I'll find her.

21:23.349 --> 21:25.150
- John James?
- Yes.

21:25.217 --> 21:28.420
I'm Cassandra Parker.
We spoke on the phone.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.957
- Hi. Hello.
- Hi.

21:31.024 --> 21:33.059
You must be Louisa.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.527
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:34.594 --> 21:39.699
You are going to be in classroom T
with Mr. Anderson.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.901
- You're Sam, right?
- Uh-huh.

21:41.968 --> 21:46.339
You're going to be in my class,
number 4.

21:46.406 --> 21:49.442
Why don't you two follow
the rest of the kids inside?

21:49.509 --> 21:51.410
Sure.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.713
- I'll see you at 3?
- All right.

21:56.382 --> 21:58.250
Do l have to go?

22:03.757 --> 22:06.192
Can you give it a chance for me, Sam?

22:07.861 --> 22:10.363
- Okay.
- Okay. Good.

22:16.169 --> 22:18.204
How did you know who l was?

22:18.270 --> 22:21.473
Oh. It's a small town.

22:21.541 --> 22:24.210
l know most of the parents and kids.

22:24.276 --> 22:29.948
But, uh, l read your book,
Lines of fire, twice.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.350
I'm kind of a fan.

22:32.418 --> 22:34.620
Is that weird?
Should l have not said anything?

22:34.688 --> 22:38.324
No. No. It's always better
to meet a fan than a critic.

22:38.390 --> 22:40.425
You're not perfect.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.729
It was nice meeting you.

22:43.797 --> 22:45.798
Nice meeting you.

23:00.647 --> 23:01.914
You're in my seat.

23:01.982 --> 23:03.550
Sorry.

23:03.617 --> 23:05.652
l don't want it now.

23:05.719 --> 23:08.421
Do l? You put your ass on it.

23:10.056 --> 23:13.492
Oh, what? Is little baby going to cry?

23:29.508 --> 23:31.409
Did you find everything all right today?

23:31.477 --> 23:32.744
Mm-hmm.

23:32.812 --> 23:35.347
So are you visiting? On vacation?

23:35.414 --> 23:37.582
No, we just moved here
and bought a house.

23:37.651 --> 23:40.286
Oh, well, welcome to Mercy.

23:40.352 --> 23:43.555
Thank you. l can barely believe it myself.

23:43.623 --> 23:45.791
You buy that house on Bacon Street?

23:45.859 --> 23:51.231
No, we're-- we're of, uh, we're of 38
up a dirt road called Red Creek.

23:51.298 --> 23:52.365
Really?

23:52.431 --> 23:53.999
Pam.

23:59.105 --> 24:02.107
Ooh, uh, what is it?

24:02.175 --> 24:03.943
It's nothing.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.845
Really, man, it's nothing.

24:11.517 --> 24:13.518
Okay, okay.

24:13.586 --> 24:15.020
Really what?

24:15.088 --> 24:17.857
it's nothing.
It's just stupid local stories.

24:17.924 --> 24:19.325
Rumors, really.

24:19.391 --> 24:21.259
- Rumors?
- Pam.

24:21.328 --> 24:23.329
What about that woman?

24:23.395 --> 24:25.163
Sarah Wayne? And her daughter?

24:25.231 --> 24:28.200
Dear God, Pam,
enough with the gossip.

24:30.203 --> 24:31.871
Anything else for you?

24:31.938 --> 24:34.040
No, this is it.

24:34.107 --> 24:38.344
And most of the ants inside these farms
are harvest ants,

24:38.410 --> 24:40.845
but they have a nickname.
Does anyone know what that is?

24:40.914 --> 24:42.649
- Yes.
- Beard ants.

24:42.716 --> 24:45.652
Bearded ants. That's right.
And why is that?

24:45.719 --> 24:47.187
Because they have tiny beards.

24:47.253 --> 24:49.855
That's right.
They have tiny little beards.

24:49.923 --> 24:51.557
They're kind of hard to see, though.

24:51.624 --> 24:56.895
Now, there is, also, inside here
a queen ant.

24:56.963 --> 25:02.568
A queen ant spends a lot of time
building all these tunnels,

25:02.635 --> 25:06.238
and she finds a nice soft spot
where she can lay her eggs.

25:06.306 --> 25:09.275
And after she does,
she pretty much stays there.

25:11.277 --> 25:12.711
Marmalade!

25:15.782 --> 25:17.116
Kitty!

25:55.088 --> 25:57.223
Oh, God.

26:04.630 --> 26:07.065
Uh--

26:07.133 --> 26:09.735
I've been learning about all
deferent kinds of ants.

26:09.803 --> 26:11.171
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

26:11.237 --> 26:14.840
There's the army ants that never
stay in one place for too long.

26:14.908 --> 26:17.076
- Yeah?
- And then there's these kinds of ants

26:17.143 --> 26:18.677
that stay in their colony forever,

26:18.745 --> 26:21.247
only to send out a scout
to look for food and stuff.

26:21.314 --> 26:22.748
- Mm-hmm.
- There's only one girl ant

26:22.816 --> 26:24.784
in the whole family. She's the queen ant.

26:24.851 --> 26:26.786
- The grownup.
- And she's in charge.

26:28.788 --> 26:30.456
What else did you do?

26:30.522 --> 26:33.157
Well, after we all got ant farms,

26:33.226 --> 26:36.762
me, Steven, and George played ping pong
during lunch for, like, hours.

26:36.830 --> 26:39.332
- Miss Parker's really nice.

26:39.399 --> 26:41.200
What about you? What did you--

26:42.368 --> 26:43.669
What did you do?

26:46.605 --> 26:48.206
What's wrong with her?

26:48.274 --> 26:49.875
l don't know.

26:53.847 --> 26:56.816
Is little baby going to cry?

26:58.451 --> 26:59.552
Mm!

28:18.797 --> 28:20.932
Aah! God.

28:26.573 --> 28:28.741
Mm.

28:38.585 --> 28:40.420
Son of a bitch.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.776
Louisa?

29:09.449 --> 29:10.817
Sam?

29:10.882 --> 29:11.949
Daddy?

29:15.989 --> 29:17.590
Have you, uh,

29:17.656 --> 29:19.290
have you seen Louisa?

29:21.160 --> 29:22.828
Did you find Marmalade yet?

29:25.164 --> 29:26.798
No, l haven't.

29:28.301 --> 29:31.170
l haven't found Marmalade yet, honey.

29:31.237 --> 29:34.473
Were you playing outside?

29:35.541 --> 29:36.875
Mm-mm.

29:40.647 --> 29:43.683
Uh, bedtime soon, okay?

29:43.749 --> 29:45.150
Okay.

29:56.695 --> 29:58.029
Louisa?

30:03.036 --> 30:05.471
Louisa, is everything all right?

30:10.709 --> 30:12.343
Louisa!

30:12.412 --> 30:13.479
Yeah?

30:16.215 --> 30:18.584
Were you just, uh...

30:18.651 --> 30:20.886
Were you just outside?

30:20.952 --> 30:23.187
I'm in the bathtub.

30:23.256 --> 30:25.658
Are you all right?

30:25.724 --> 30:26.758
Yes.

30:28.594 --> 30:29.928
Okay.

30:32.165 --> 30:34.867
Okay, but just-- next time,

30:34.933 --> 30:37.335
just be back home before it gets dark.

32:27.012 --> 32:28.813
Louisa, you, uh--

32:28.880 --> 32:31.349
I'm coming.

32:36.389 --> 32:38.357
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

32:47.733 --> 32:48.867
Come here, baby.

34:16.455 --> 34:17.556
Daddy?

34:20.158 --> 34:21.926
We have to go to school.

34:21.993 --> 34:24.495
Oh. Okay.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.331
Louisa.

34:28.801 --> 34:31.003
God damn it.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.370
What happened?

34:32.438 --> 34:34.172
I'm sorry.

34:38.945 --> 34:41.947
Honey, we're going to be late.

34:43.616 --> 34:44.750
I'm ready.

34:53.190 --> 34:55.493
Sam, where's your backpack?

34:56.629 --> 34:57.930
My room.

34:57.996 --> 34:59.163
Go get it.

35:02.033 --> 35:03.401
Uh, when--

35:03.469 --> 35:06.004
when did you, um...

35:07.974 --> 35:09.642
Are you hungry?

35:09.709 --> 35:11.110
No.

35:14.012 --> 35:17.415
How did you, uh, sleep last night?

35:17.483 --> 35:20.052
Fine.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.020
You don't remember sleepwalking?

35:23.088 --> 35:25.290
l had to put you back in your bed.

35:25.357 --> 35:27.459
Well, did you take Molly?

35:27.526 --> 35:29.427
What?

35:29.495 --> 35:32.231
My doll. Molly.

35:32.297 --> 35:35.066
l woke up this morning,
and l couldn't find her.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.536
No, l-- l didn't take Molly, but l did--

35:40.171 --> 35:41.839
l did find this.

35:43.709 --> 35:47.045
- What's that?
- l don't know. You tell me.

35:47.112 --> 35:49.581
Did you, uh-- Did you make this?

35:49.648 --> 35:51.583
l don't know what that is.

35:53.084 --> 35:54.552
You were holding it last night.

35:59.992 --> 36:01.059
I'm ready.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.362
Let's go, Sam.

36:05.397 --> 36:06.765
Come on, Dad.

36:08.667 --> 36:09.968
And his grades are much better this year.

36:10.036 --> 36:13.572
l can really tell that he's
been picking up a lot.

36:13.639 --> 36:17.275
l can see all the work that you've
been doing on his reading and--

36:18.511 --> 36:19.545
Good morning.

36:30.556 --> 36:32.925
Louisa!

37:51.103 --> 37:52.604
Hey, you.

37:52.671 --> 37:55.173
Are you hiding from me?

38:04.783 --> 38:07.218
You're scared, aren't you?

38:08.854 --> 38:11.456
What is wrong with you?

38:11.523 --> 38:14.459
Are you deaf?

38:14.526 --> 38:16.294
Say something.

39:18.556 --> 39:20.391
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.295
Where's Louisa?

39:24.362 --> 39:26.230
She's resting in the nurse's office.

39:27.900 --> 39:30.469
We had another girl slip and fall.

39:30.535 --> 39:31.702
Broke an arm.

39:42.447 --> 39:44.715
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:48.753 --> 39:50.054
How are you feeling?

39:50.122 --> 39:52.090
- l don't feel good.
- Yeah?

39:52.157 --> 39:56.227
After l called you,
she threw up a few more times.

39:56.294 --> 39:58.763
My stomach hurts.

39:58.831 --> 40:00.332
All right, let's go home.

40:00.398 --> 40:03.033
Can you walk,
or do you want me to carry you?

40:03.102 --> 40:05.504
- Carry me.
- Okay.

40:10.642 --> 40:12.944
- Oh.
- I'm sorry, Daddy.

40:14.179 --> 40:17.782
It's okay, honey.
You're going to feel better soon.

40:21.352 --> 40:23.654
It's a tough age for girls.

40:23.721 --> 40:27.291
Hormones, puberty... boys.

40:28.326 --> 40:31.195
- It can be tough on fathers, too.
- Yes, it can.

40:31.263 --> 40:32.931
She's, uh...

40:34.332 --> 40:35.966
They both had it rough for a while.

40:36.035 --> 40:38.971
My-- My wife and l just got divorced,

40:39.038 --> 40:41.707
so now with this move, it's just--

40:41.773 --> 40:44.008
it's a lot for them to take in.

40:44.076 --> 40:45.677
They might surprise you, though.

40:45.743 --> 40:50.280
Kids have a way of coping with change,
sometimes better than adults.

40:50.348 --> 40:51.382
Yeah.

40:51.449 --> 40:54.652
And I've had experience
with adopted children,

40:54.719 --> 40:56.487
- and they in no way--
- What?

40:56.554 --> 40:58.322
Adopted?

40:58.389 --> 41:00.457
Louisa's told me that she--

41:02.727 --> 41:04.128
Oh.

41:06.165 --> 41:07.566
Louisa said that she was--

41:07.632 --> 41:09.233
- Yeah.
- ...adopted?

41:09.301 --> 41:12.237
Yeah. And with her dark hair,
as opposed to yours and Sam's--

41:12.304 --> 41:14.739
- She-- She takes after her mom.
- Right.

41:16.041 --> 41:18.343
Sorry.

41:20.645 --> 41:21.746
Here.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.349
My home phone number,

41:24.415 --> 41:29.019
in case you ever need someone to talk to.

41:30.055 --> 41:34.325
Thanks. l, uh, l better get going.

41:34.392 --> 41:36.160
- Bye.
- Bye.

42:04.356 --> 42:05.690
Aah!

42:43.395 --> 42:44.662
Aah!

43:16.494 --> 43:19.930
l told you l want you home
before it gets dark, honey.

43:25.103 --> 43:26.270
Louisa.

43:30.142 --> 43:32.611
We need to talk.

43:32.677 --> 43:34.945
It's okay. l get it, all right? l get it.

43:35.012 --> 43:38.949
You're not a child anymore.
You're changing.

43:39.016 --> 43:40.517
And l know, all right?

43:40.585 --> 43:42.820
l know l got a lot to learn
about being a parent,

43:42.887 --> 43:44.455
but l promise--

43:44.522 --> 43:47.658
l promise you I'm doing the best l can.

43:49.727 --> 43:52.229
lf this move doesn't work for you
and you hate it--

43:52.297 --> 43:53.698
l don't hate it, Dad.

43:55.066 --> 43:56.066
No?

43:56.134 --> 43:57.468
No.

44:14.419 --> 44:16.420
Honey, what's this?
Where did you get these?

44:16.488 --> 44:17.689
Don't touch me.

44:17.755 --> 44:18.755
Hey, l was just--

44:18.823 --> 44:20.925
Why do you always have to ruin everything?

44:20.992 --> 44:22.727
- Honey, l was just--
- Just leave me alone.

44:22.793 --> 44:24.594
l just want to see if you're all right.

46:21.313 --> 46:22.313
Uhh!

47:12.029 --> 47:15.265
l went to San Francisco on a signing tour,

47:15.333 --> 47:18.669
and a week later, when l got back
to, uh, Charleston,

47:18.736 --> 47:23.941
she'd already hired a divorce attorney
and-- -- filed papers.

47:24.008 --> 47:25.843
- Wow.
- Yeah.

47:25.910 --> 47:28.345
So sudden doesn't really cover it.

47:28.413 --> 47:30.782
No.

47:30.848 --> 47:32.583
So...

47:32.651 --> 47:35.053
how did you end up with the kids?

47:36.722 --> 47:42.294
That's the part
that l still don't understand yet.

47:42.360 --> 47:44.295
l mean, my wife, uh--

47:44.362 --> 47:49.734
my-- my ex-wife Isabel,
she wanted to start a family.

47:49.800 --> 47:54.070
She wanted us to move to Charleston
so we could be near to her parents,

47:54.138 --> 47:57.140
and then, all of a sudden, she, uh...

47:57.208 --> 48:00.411
she didn't want anything to do with us.

48:02.213 --> 48:05.883
And now I'm, uh, I'm here,

48:05.950 --> 48:08.752
and l know this is the most important
thing that I've ever done.

48:08.819 --> 48:11.788
l know that, and it--

48:11.856 --> 48:14.291
and it scares me...

48:14.358 --> 48:16.827
more than anything.

48:32.176 --> 48:35.846
John, you're not going to fail them.

48:35.913 --> 48:37.681
You're doing a great job.

48:37.749 --> 48:40.785
Oh, yeah. I'm doing great, you know.
I'm doing really great.

48:40.851 --> 48:42.953
l don't even know who Louisa--

48:43.020 --> 48:44.988
l don't even know who Louisa is anymore.

48:45.055 --> 48:47.924
One minute she's my, uh, my little girl,

48:47.992 --> 48:50.928
and then the next minute
she's telling me to go, you know,

48:50.995 --> 48:52.596
screw myself.

48:55.032 --> 48:56.800
You want to know what l think?

48:56.867 --> 48:58.635
l do.

48:58.703 --> 49:04.675
l think you're probably a lot stronger
than you give yourself credit for.

49:08.613 --> 49:10.281
Thank you.

50:10.007 --> 50:12.175
Louisa?

50:22.286 --> 50:24.888
Louisa, is that you?

50:24.955 --> 50:26.523
Honey?

50:53.919 --> 50:55.253
Louisa.

51:20.978 --> 51:22.112
Uhh!

51:45.469 --> 51:46.870
- Dad.
- Go inside.

51:46.938 --> 51:50.107
What happened? Dad?
Is everything okay?

51:50.174 --> 51:52.309
- Just go inside.
- Daddy.

51:56.647 --> 51:58.281
Were you just outside?

51:58.349 --> 51:59.783
No.

52:03.788 --> 52:06.457
l don't want you playing
out in the fields anymore, honey.

52:08.392 --> 52:10.794
l don't want you
playing out on the mound.

52:10.862 --> 52:13.164
So you take me away
from all of my friends,

52:13.230 --> 52:14.764
- and now l can't even go outside?
- Louisa--

52:14.833 --> 52:16.201
Look, l don't care.

53:00.011 --> 53:01.212
What's wrong?

53:01.278 --> 53:03.747
All my ants are dying.

53:05.582 --> 53:07.884
l think it got too hot.

53:07.952 --> 53:09.586
Or maybe it got too cold.

53:10.587 --> 53:12.689
Did l kill them?

53:14.124 --> 53:18.294
Well, ants usually don't live
that long anyway, honey,

53:18.362 --> 53:21.765
and remember what you were saying
about there only being one girl ant?

53:21.833 --> 53:22.867
You know, the queen?

53:22.934 --> 53:25.303
Do you think she died?

53:25.369 --> 53:26.970
They can't live without her.

53:27.038 --> 53:30.374
Usually, before one queen dies,
another one is born, and--

53:30.441 --> 53:31.742
See, there's, uh--

53:31.810 --> 53:34.412
See? There's still some
moving around in there.

53:34.478 --> 53:38.081
We'll just-- We'll just have to
wait and see, honey.

53:38.148 --> 53:41.050
What happens
if the queen dies before then?

53:41.118 --> 53:43.453
Well, l don't--
Honey, l don't think that she will.

53:43.520 --> 53:44.721
But what if she does?

53:44.788 --> 53:46.389
Sam, I've got to go talk
to somebody, okay?

53:46.457 --> 53:48.592
Can you watch some cartoons?

53:58.302 --> 54:01.304
Could it have been a kid throwing rocks?

54:01.371 --> 54:02.472
No.

54:04.641 --> 54:05.842
Well...

54:07.444 --> 54:09.445
l don't know, then.

54:09.513 --> 54:12.782
We don't get anything out here
bigger than a pig.

54:13.784 --> 54:16.086
Former owners
never mentioned anything.

54:16.153 --> 54:19.289
All they ever asked about
was that old Indian burial mound.

54:21.926 --> 54:23.827
Is that what that is?

54:23.895 --> 54:27.031
Oh, l don't know.

54:27.098 --> 54:28.966
Probably.

54:29.033 --> 54:31.335
Was that the only thing
you wanted to talk about?

54:31.401 --> 54:33.803
No, l wanted to talk to you
about the sale of the house

54:33.871 --> 54:36.106
and the woman that went missing--
Sarah Wayne.

54:37.441 --> 54:38.809
- What?
- Sarah Wayne.

54:38.876 --> 54:40.277
She lived here with her daughter.

54:40.344 --> 54:41.678
l read about it.

54:41.745 --> 54:42.779
- Right.
- Right.

54:42.846 --> 54:44.647
- About that--
- And when l bought the house,

54:44.715 --> 54:47.651
you told me that the seller
was Roger Wayne.

54:47.718 --> 54:50.153
Yeah. No. He was the seller, John.

54:50.220 --> 54:52.488
- He was co-signer on Sarah's loan.
- Right.

54:52.556 --> 54:54.557
When she disappeared,
he became the heir.

54:54.625 --> 54:56.193
You never told me anything about this.

54:56.260 --> 54:59.062
Well, there was no crime committed.

54:59.130 --> 55:03.000
Okay? It was just assumed
that Sarah couldn't' t make payments,

55:03.067 --> 55:04.067
so she bolted.

55:04.135 --> 55:06.036
Yeah, but she left her 16-year-old
daughter, Stew.

55:06.104 --> 55:08.239
You don't think that was
an important piece of information?

55:08.305 --> 55:10.073
- Oh, come on.
- If not a little strange?

55:10.141 --> 55:13.911
Look, John, the world is full
of deadbeat parents. Hmm?

55:20.417 --> 55:22.919
You're going to love this.

55:22.987 --> 55:25.155
What did you find?

55:25.222 --> 55:27.023
You have to see.

55:37.501 --> 55:39.502
What's up there, Lou?

55:39.570 --> 55:42.205
After Sarah disappeared,

55:42.272 --> 55:45.375
Roger took his granddaughter
Emily away.

55:45.442 --> 55:46.776
Where?

55:46.843 --> 55:49.378
l don't-- A suburb of Charleston.

55:49.446 --> 55:52.182
Suburb of Charleston. Okay.

55:52.249 --> 55:54.084
Anything else?

55:55.619 --> 55:58.455
And there was a house fire,

55:58.522 --> 56:00.690
and the girl died.

56:04.428 --> 56:07.063
There was a house fire,
and the girl died,

56:07.131 --> 56:09.399
And you never told me
anything about this.

56:09.466 --> 56:11.901
It doesn't have anything
to do with you, John.

56:11.969 --> 56:15.205
You're going to give me the address
of the house that burned, Stewart,

56:15.272 --> 56:18.041
and then I'm going to find
this Roger Wayne.

56:18.109 --> 56:22.313
l have to know if my family is safe.

56:22.379 --> 56:24.214
Louisa?

56:26.917 --> 56:28.151
Louisa?

56:34.558 --> 56:35.792
Lou?

56:41.598 --> 56:43.800
Seven stitches, Lou.

56:43.867 --> 56:47.270
Seven stitches.
What in the world were you thinking?

56:47.337 --> 56:50.239
l didn't even scare him
He just let go of the ladder.

56:50.307 --> 56:53.476
You're his older sister.
You're supposed to look out for him.

56:53.543 --> 56:54.911
Sorry.

56:57.181 --> 56:59.316
And he said you were
out at the mound again.

56:59.383 --> 57:01.284
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

57:01.351 --> 57:03.586
Yes? Well, what did l tell you?

57:03.654 --> 57:06.189
- Well, you don't let me do anything.
- You--

57:07.858 --> 57:10.427
You just sit here and wait.

57:10.494 --> 57:12.295
You understand me?

57:14.299 --> 57:16.000
We'll be going home soon.

57:26.376 --> 57:27.944
- Hello.
- Hi.

57:28.011 --> 57:29.479
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

57:29.546 --> 57:31.047
Oh, no problem at all.

57:31.115 --> 57:33.984
Cassandra Parker has given you
a glowing recommendation.

57:34.051 --> 57:35.318
Oh, that was nice of her.

57:35.385 --> 57:36.619
Please, uh, come in.

57:39.656 --> 57:41.824
- This is Sam.
- Hi, Sam.

57:41.892 --> 57:43.460
Hi.

57:43.527 --> 57:46.329
My daughter Louisa's upstairs, okay?

57:46.396 --> 57:50.166
I'm only going to be gone
four or five hours, all right?

57:50.234 --> 57:51.535
Okay.

57:51.601 --> 57:53.336
So if I'm delayed for any reason,
I'll call you.

57:53.403 --> 57:54.937
- All right.
- Okay?

57:55.005 --> 57:58.842
You'll be good? Yeah? You'll be okay?

57:58.909 --> 58:00.577
- Big boy?
- Mm-hmm.

58:00.644 --> 58:02.679
- Hmm? All right? Okay.
- Okay.

58:02.746 --> 58:06.082
Um, one more thing.

58:06.150 --> 58:08.185
Louisa is, uh, grounded.

58:08.252 --> 58:10.420
She likes to play out in the fields
in the back,

58:10.487 --> 58:12.655
but she's not allowed to right now.

58:12.723 --> 58:14.157
I'll make sure she doesn't.

58:14.225 --> 58:16.560
Okay. Be good.

58:51.094 --> 58:52.862
Professor Evan White's office.

58:52.929 --> 58:53.996
Yeah, this is John.

58:54.064 --> 58:56.699
Hello, Mr. James.
We just got your email.

58:56.767 --> 58:57.767
Listen--

58:57.834 --> 58:59.368
- It's very interesting.
- Yeah.

58:59.436 --> 59:01.237
The professor's looking at your photos.

59:01.305 --> 59:02.639
Listen, l really--

59:02.706 --> 59:04.274
- Evan, it's our writer.
- What?

59:04.342 --> 59:05.876
The one with the mound.

59:05.942 --> 59:08.077
- Evan.
- Okay, I'll be--

59:08.145 --> 59:09.279
Evan!

01:00:11.641 --> 01:00:13.009
Sam.

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:16.312
What?

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.482
Come play with me.

01:00:28.359 --> 01:00:30.227
Where?

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:32.428
The mound.

01:00:32.497 --> 01:00:35.132
We're not supposed to, Lou.

01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:41.638
We're not supposed to, Lou.

01:02:59.175 --> 01:03:00.442
Aah!

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:02.612
- Get out!
- Okay.

01:03:02.679 --> 01:03:05.515
- This is my house! Get out!
- All right.

01:03:05.583 --> 01:03:07.618
- You're not wanted here.
- Wait.

01:03:07.684 --> 01:03:09.852
- Get out!
- Roger Wayne?

01:03:11.154 --> 01:03:14.690
Oh. I'm sorry. Are you--

01:03:14.758 --> 01:03:17.060
Are you Roger Wayne?

01:03:19.664 --> 01:03:22.199
What did you say?

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:26.569
l was going to get rid of that house.

01:03:26.637 --> 01:03:29.373
Did you ever go out there?

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:34.677
Just once. l hadn't heard from Sarah
in over three weeks.

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:37.780
l was worried. l drove down.

01:03:37.847 --> 01:03:39.415
She was gone.

01:03:40.717 --> 01:03:42.885
And Emily--

01:03:44.254 --> 01:03:49.392
l heard about your... granddaughter.

01:03:49.459 --> 01:03:51.561
You live there now?

01:03:51.629 --> 01:03:52.830
Yeah.

01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:56.399
Have any children?

01:03:56.466 --> 01:03:59.836
Yeah. A boy and a girl.

01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:06.176
She changing?

01:04:07.277 --> 01:04:08.678
What?

01:04:08.745 --> 01:04:11.914
Your daughter, is she changing?

01:04:16.086 --> 01:04:18.087
Emily changed.

01:04:19.724 --> 01:04:21.692
What do you mean?

01:04:21.758 --> 01:04:26.395
When l went out to that house,
l found her locked in the bedroom.

01:04:26.463 --> 01:04:30.133
From the outside.
Sarah had locked her in there.

01:04:31.468 --> 01:04:33.136
What are you talking about?

01:04:34.804 --> 01:04:38.941
l brought Emily back to the city,
but she was sick.

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:41.677
Something inside of her had changed.

01:04:41.746 --> 01:04:45.049
One night l woke up. It was pouring rain.

01:04:45.115 --> 01:04:46.883
l went to check on her.

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:51.387
She wasn't in bed.

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:55.791
l found her in the backyard,
covered in mud

01:04:55.859 --> 01:05:01.297
and digging in the ground
with her hands.

01:05:01.364 --> 01:05:08.804
She wasn't really awake,
but she wasn't really asleep, either.

01:05:11.341 --> 01:05:13.776
She didn't even seem to notice,

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:16.045
and l thank God for that.

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:20.950
When l picked her up
and brought her inside...

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:25.488
l started the fire.

01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:34.029
What?

01:05:35.832 --> 01:05:38.834
She wasn't my granddaughter anymore.

01:05:38.902 --> 01:05:41.337
l had to do it. So will you.

01:05:41.404 --> 01:05:45.274
Wait a minute. You started the fire?

01:05:45.341 --> 01:05:49.111
My Sarah couldn't do
what needed to be done.

01:05:49.179 --> 01:05:53.149
That's why she locked Emily
in the bedroom.

01:05:53.216 --> 01:05:57.787
A father will do anything for his daughter,
even the worst thing.

01:05:58.823 --> 01:06:00.057
Even the worst thing!

01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:06.028
Taking her away from that place
did nothing!

01:06:06.095 --> 01:06:08.897
You can't stop it!

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:18.507
Good night, Sam. Sweet dreams.

01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:20.143
Good night, Mrs. Amworth.

01:06:25.048 --> 01:06:28.684
Oh. Oh, Louisa, you scared me.

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:32.354
Have you been outside?

01:06:32.422 --> 01:06:35.591
You'll definitely have to have a bath
before bed, so go wash up.

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:37.159
Look at you. You have--

01:07:14.564 --> 01:07:16.799
- Damn it.

01:08:24.367 --> 01:08:26.868
Sam? Louisa?

01:08:26.937 --> 01:08:29.238
Open the door, please.

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:31.173
Open the door!

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.274
Sam!

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:36.778
- Open the door.

01:08:36.845 --> 01:08:39.215
- Open the door.

01:08:40.984 --> 01:08:42.819
Louisa?

01:08:42.885 --> 01:08:47.322
Louisa, open the door.
For God's sake, open the door!

01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:49.524
Oh, Jesus!

01:08:49.591 --> 01:08:51.460
Louisa!

01:08:51.527 --> 01:08:53.528
Louisa!

01:08:53.595 --> 01:08:56.999
- Louisa! Louisa!

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:02.671
- Please help me!

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:31.667
Mrs. Amworth?

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.014
Louisa.

01:09:54.757 --> 01:09:56.091
Sam?

01:09:59.228 --> 01:10:00.696
Sam?

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:04.099
Sam, are you in there?

01:10:05.635 --> 01:10:07.069
Sam?

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:10.072
Sam!

01:10:21.085 --> 01:10:23.954
Sam. Are you all right?

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:27.589
Sam, are you okay?

01:10:28.991 --> 01:10:30.792
What's wrong?

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:32.228
Huh?

01:10:32.295 --> 01:10:35.598
Hey. What's wrong?

01:10:35.665 --> 01:10:37.133
What's wrong?

01:10:39.135 --> 01:10:41.070
l heard screaming.

01:10:45.608 --> 01:10:46.775
Louisa.

01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:51.113
Louisa, wake up. Wake up.

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:53.181
- Daddy.
- Where's Mrs. Amworth?

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:56.018
- What?
- Mrs. Amworth, the babysitter.

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:57.519
Where is she?

01:10:57.587 --> 01:10:58.921
l don't know.

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:15.904
So l just went to bed.

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:19.975
Um, l woke up when my dad
came into my room.

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:22.277
And you didn't hear anyone screaming?

01:11:22.345 --> 01:11:24.613
Mm-mm.

01:11:26.182 --> 01:11:31.620
You, Sam, you said
you heard the sound of screams, right?

01:11:31.687 --> 01:11:33.855
l heard her.

01:11:35.558 --> 01:11:37.493
It was scary.

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:42.298
Okay.

01:11:44.667 --> 01:11:46.301
Ms. Parker.

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:52.174
Maybe it's not too far down the road.

01:11:52.241 --> 01:11:53.408
Yeah. Yeah.

01:11:56.512 --> 01:12:00.082
So, uh, what happens now?

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:02.985
Well, I'm going to take a ride
over to Evelyn's.

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:07.289
Hopefully, she's just left and gone home.

01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:09.558
That wouldn't be like Evelyn at all.

01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:14.130
You'll call me
as soon as you hear everything?

01:12:14.197 --> 01:12:19.335
l will. In fact, Mr. James,
make sure you stay where l can reach you.

01:12:23.105 --> 01:12:24.539
Good evening.

01:12:30.213 --> 01:12:32.048
Do you want me to stay?

01:12:36.786 --> 01:12:38.220
Better not.

01:12:39.755 --> 01:12:41.456
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:43.458
Okay.

01:12:53.269 --> 01:12:55.838
Your girlfriend's not staying over?

01:12:55.905 --> 01:12:57.373
No.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.275
Don't you want her to?

01:13:02.245 --> 01:13:04.747
Cassandra's going home,
and it's time for bed.

01:13:04.814 --> 01:13:07.483
Why, because you say so?

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:10.119
Yes, Louisa. Because l say so.

01:13:10.186 --> 01:13:12.087
I'm the father. You're the daughter.

01:13:12.154 --> 01:13:14.756
Well, you don't know
how to be a fath--

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.581
Daddy.

01:13:40.283 --> 01:13:42.151
I'm so cold.

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.088
It's okay.

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:48.590
Everything's going to be okay.

01:13:49.825 --> 01:13:52.761
Are you going to leave me?

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:55.931
No. No.

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:58.433
I'm not going to leave you.

01:13:58.501 --> 01:14:00.035
But Mommy left.

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:02.771
Why did Mommy leave?

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:14.650
You'll leave me, too, won't you?

01:14:14.717 --> 01:14:16.151
Louisa.

01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:22.324
I'll never leave you.

01:14:30.833 --> 01:14:32.901
You have to try and rest, okay?

01:15:25.921 --> 01:15:27.122
Daddy.

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:32.127
Can l sleep with you tonight?

01:16:34.623 --> 01:16:36.124
Daddy!

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:54.676
I'm your new daughter.

01:17:25.241 --> 01:17:26.842
All right, get your stuff.

01:17:26.909 --> 01:17:29.177
I'll be right here
when you guys get out, okay?

01:17:29.245 --> 01:17:30.379
Okay, Daddy. Bye.

01:17:36.551 --> 01:17:38.219
Have you heard from the police yet?

01:17:38.287 --> 01:17:40.188
- Yeah.
- And?

01:17:40.256 --> 01:17:41.890
And there's still no sign of her.

01:17:44.527 --> 01:17:47.196
She's going to turn up, Cassandra.
She has to.

01:17:47.263 --> 01:17:48.330
Can you--

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.068
Can you keep an eye on Louisa for me?

01:17:53.135 --> 01:17:54.703
Absolutely.

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:56.338
All right. Thank you.

01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:41.550
Oh, no.

01:18:43.586 --> 01:18:45.254
Ohh...

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:53.761
- Rick?
- Yeah.

01:18:53.829 --> 01:18:55.897
I'm taking the mound down today.

01:18:55.965 --> 01:18:57.299
These things can be tricky.

01:18:57.366 --> 01:19:00.068
Maybe these things can be tricky.
l don't care.

01:19:00.135 --> 01:19:02.570
Many root systems go down pretty deep.

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:05.606
- Yeah, l--
- You have to get way below surface.

01:19:05.673 --> 01:19:07.307
- l don't--
- bring the diesel--

01:19:07.376 --> 01:19:08.977
- Listen to me.
- Ammonium nitrate--

01:19:09.044 --> 01:19:10.912
- Rick, look.
- Yeah.

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:14.083
Get that bulldozer up here
as soon as possible, all right?

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:15.917
- Sure, Mr. James.
- Thank you.

01:19:33.701 --> 01:19:35.803
- Yeah?
- Mr. James,

01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:38.106
this is Evan White from
the University of Charleston.

01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:39.207
Hello, Professor.

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:41.476
I've taken a look at the photos
of your property.

01:19:41.543 --> 01:19:43.177
- I'm very intrigued.
- Well, actually, um--

01:19:43.245 --> 01:19:46.047
Would it be possible for me to come
down there today and take a look?

01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:47.549
l do appreciate you taking the time,

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:49.017
but there's been a change of plan.

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:52.120
I'm actually going to be
taking the mound down today.

01:19:52.187 --> 01:19:54.022
Could you at least wait
until we get there?

01:19:54.089 --> 01:19:56.825
l can't talk about this anymore.
It's something l have to do today.

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:58.026
- Please--
- Thank you very much.

01:19:58.093 --> 01:19:59.360
Mr. James, please--

01:20:15.678 --> 01:20:17.846
This baby's going to blow.

01:20:38.367 --> 01:20:39.868
Don't stop.

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:46.574
Hello?

01:20:48.077 --> 01:20:50.446
Professor Evan White.
We spoke on the phone.

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:51.846
Oh, that's right.

01:20:51.914 --> 01:20:53.782
Look.

01:20:53.848 --> 01:20:55.783
Alexis Danella.

01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:58.719
- I'm the professor's.
- Hello.

01:20:58.786 --> 01:21:02.523
Mr. James, an excavation
wouldn't take much time,

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:05.226
and ritualized mound burial--

01:21:05.294 --> 01:21:09.131
its study, it's important.

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:11.266
No, I'm doing this today.

01:21:12.468 --> 01:21:14.469
What a waste.

01:21:15.738 --> 01:21:18.107
Mr. James, mound burial is something

01:21:18.173 --> 01:21:21.576
that links many civilizations
all across the globe.

01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:23.778
I'm sorry.

01:21:23.845 --> 01:21:26.547
This wants to be studied.

01:21:26.615 --> 01:21:29.884
Hey, how come
they bury their dead like this?

01:21:29.952 --> 01:21:31.787
Mostly, they didn't.

01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:34.655
Mound burial
was only for the most revered

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:38.626
because, at least in some cases,
the mounds themselves were worshiped.

01:21:38.694 --> 01:21:41.663
We found some evidence
in a limestone cave in Mississippi.

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:45.900
There's drawings
that might depict a mythology

01:21:45.968 --> 01:21:49.104
of the gods that existed
inside the mounds.

01:21:50.272 --> 01:21:51.439
Inside?

01:21:51.507 --> 01:21:53.842
They called them mound walkers.

01:21:53.908 --> 01:21:55.309
Mounds were places of power,

01:21:55.377 --> 01:21:58.747
and the walkers were believed to be
a dying race of deities,

01:21:58.813 --> 01:22:00.915
weakened over thousands of years

01:22:00.983 --> 01:22:02.784
by the encroachment of humans
onto their land.

01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:04.484
Rick, go on.

01:22:04.553 --> 01:22:07.289
I've even found depictions of a ritual,

01:22:07.356 --> 01:22:10.025
an exchanging of gifts
between the walkers

01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:13.028
and children of some of the native tribes.

01:22:14.496 --> 01:22:16.364
Dolls?

01:22:21.036 --> 01:22:22.504
Well...

01:22:22.571 --> 01:22:24.272
Straw dolls?

01:22:24.339 --> 01:22:26.040
Yes, that's right. Um...

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:29.945
- how did you know that? l haven't--

01:22:31.213 --> 01:22:33.181
Rick, wait.

01:22:42.524 --> 01:22:44.559
What did they want?

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:47.495
What any species wants-- to survive.

01:22:47.563 --> 01:22:51.633
So, when faced with extinction,
the gods themselves began to pray.

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:53.802
Pray for what?

01:22:53.868 --> 01:22:57.371
A savior, a chosen one.

01:22:57.439 --> 01:23:00.074
And she would come
from the un-likeliest of places.

01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:01.676
She would be human--

01:23:04.213 --> 01:23:05.547
...young girl--

01:23:08.183 --> 01:23:10.084
and then the mating ritual would begin.

01:23:12.421 --> 01:23:15.657
The myth was that the walkers
were an all-male race.

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:18.927
They needed a mother, a queen,
to give birth to the ne_ life's eggs.

01:23:18.993 --> 01:23:22.096
And then a new age would begin.

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:30.004
Mr. James--

01:23:30.071 --> 01:23:31.405
Do it now!

01:23:41.383 --> 01:23:43.618
Mr. James, please.

01:23:47.556 --> 01:23:50.225
Aah!

01:23:57.132 --> 01:24:01.069
I've had officers combing for blood
in and around your house all day.

01:24:01.136 --> 01:24:03.037
My-- My house? Look, l didn't--

01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:05.372
Hey, l didn't do this.

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.275
Okay. All right.

01:24:07.342 --> 01:24:09.210
I'd like to believe that,

01:24:09.278 --> 01:24:13.315
but we're going to do this right.

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:16.585
But you're going to have to be
helpful and patient.

01:24:16.652 --> 01:24:17.686
Understand?

01:24:17.753 --> 01:24:22.657
Can l at least call my kids
at their school?

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:24.459
l called Cassandra Parker already.

01:24:24.526 --> 01:24:25.927
She, uh...

01:24:25.993 --> 01:24:29.096
She's going to take your kids home
and stay with them.

01:24:29.164 --> 01:24:32.600
Look, l promised my kids
that l would pick them up.

01:24:32.668 --> 01:24:33.835
l understand that.

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:37.171
But I'm just going to need you
to stay here for a little while, all right?

01:24:37.239 --> 01:24:40.809
If your, uh, story checks out,
you're going to be with them soon enough.

01:24:40.876 --> 01:24:42.510
l give you my word, okay?

01:24:51.286 --> 01:24:53.388
My ants are dead.

01:24:53.455 --> 01:24:56.691
What do you mean?
What do you mean, Sam?

01:25:01.028 --> 01:25:02.996
My ants are dead.

01:25:05.968 --> 01:25:07.669
Those are eggs.

01:25:09.271 --> 01:25:11.139
Daddy was right.

01:25:11.206 --> 01:25:13.641
There's a new queen.

01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:16.411
Look how all the other ants
are surrounding her,

01:25:16.478 --> 01:25:20.915
guarding her until it's done.

01:25:20.983 --> 01:25:25.287
What's wrong, Sam?
Are you all right?

01:25:27.823 --> 01:25:31.660
l think something bad
is going to happen now.

01:25:31.727 --> 01:25:35.664
Nothing bad is going to happen. Hmm?

01:25:40.469 --> 01:25:43.638
There's something wrong with Louisa.

01:25:48.377 --> 01:25:49.411
Hello?

01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:51.780
- Hello, Ed?
- No, this is John.

01:25:51.847 --> 01:25:54.683
It's Skinner from the lab
for Officer Lowry.

01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:59.354
Hold on. I'm with Officer Lowry.
Let me put you on the speaker.

01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:04.192
Ed, hi. Look, we did a preliminary
autopsy on the body,

01:26:04.258 --> 01:26:06.793
and it appears she was eaten alive.

01:26:06.862 --> 01:26:09.397
- What could have done that?
- Ed, we're not sure.

01:26:09.464 --> 01:26:11.032
The bite marks don't match
any known creatures,

01:26:11.098 --> 01:26:14.901
and really, we've never seen
anything like this.

01:26:14.970 --> 01:26:16.571
Shit!

01:26:18.874 --> 01:26:20.275
What the--

01:26:20.342 --> 01:26:22.577
Ed, are you there?

01:26:22.644 --> 01:26:24.445
Look, we're going to have to call you back.

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:27.716
- Ed?
- Jesus Christ, l think l hit someone.

01:26:27.783 --> 01:26:30.919
No. Where are you going?
No, no, no. Stay in the car.

01:26:46.368 --> 01:26:47.435
What happened to the light?

01:26:55.142 --> 01:26:56.810
Come on.

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:00.815
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Hey!

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:09.556
Oh, my God!

01:27:42.491 --> 01:27:43.825
Cassandra!

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:47.194
Sam!

01:27:50.331 --> 01:27:51.999
Louisa!

01:28:11.887 --> 01:28:12.954
God.

01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:15.690
Oh. Cassandra.

01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:26.234
Louisa. What happened?

01:28:38.513 --> 01:28:40.314
Daddy!

01:28:40.381 --> 01:28:41.715
Sam?

01:28:43.518 --> 01:28:44.685
Sam?

01:28:49.858 --> 01:28:51.059
Daddy!

01:28:53.195 --> 01:28:56.264
It's okay, Sam. It's okay.
We're going home now.

01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:57.831
She won't let us.

01:29:00.035 --> 01:29:01.736
We're leaving, Louisa.

01:29:01.803 --> 01:29:03.838
No.

01:29:03.905 --> 01:29:05.773
We're not.

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:09.643
Louisa, listen to me.
Please, honey, just--

01:29:09.711 --> 01:29:11.746
Louisa, just come--

01:29:23.124 --> 01:29:25.259
Okay. Don't move. You don't move.

01:29:50.517 --> 01:29:52.018
I'm going down there with them.

01:29:52.087 --> 01:29:54.355
If you go somewhere, l can't follow you.

01:29:54.421 --> 01:29:56.189
You will follow.

01:29:56.258 --> 01:29:57.726
- Shut up!

01:29:57.792 --> 01:29:58.792
Shut up.

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:01.262
- Please.

01:31:43.497 --> 01:31:44.531
Louisa!

01:31:51.072 --> 01:31:52.373
Daddy!

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:02.950
Don't move, Sam.

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:17.298
Daddy!

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:26.373
No, Daddy!

01:32:32.713 --> 01:32:35.715
Daddy! Daddy!

01:32:35.784 --> 01:32:37.819
Please, no!

01:32:40.021 --> 01:32:42.289
Daddy--

01:32:42.357 --> 01:32:43.591
Daddy.

01:32:44.793 --> 01:32:47.295
Don't! Please, Daddy!

01:32:49.264 --> 01:32:50.431
Don't!

01:32:52.633 --> 01:32:54.935
Sam, you need to wait here, okay?

01:32:55.003 --> 01:32:57.572
Wait here until the police come.

01:32:57.638 --> 01:32:58.805
Here.

01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:01.942
Where are you going?

01:33:04.979 --> 01:33:10.284
Tell the police to call Mommy, okay?

01:33:10.351 --> 01:33:11.852
Dad.

01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:16.690
l love you, Sam, okay?

01:33:23.832 --> 01:33:26.267
Okay. You want your monkey?

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:29.303
Your monkey will be safe with you, okay?

01:33:30.305 --> 01:33:31.939
You be a big boy.

01:33:32.006 --> 01:33:33.207
You be a big boy.

01:34:22.991 --> 01:34:25.026
Be a big boy.

01:36:50.037 --> 01:36:51.204
Come on.

01:38:03.444 --> 01:38:05.045
Louisa?

01:38:10.451 --> 01:38:11.752
Louisa.

01:38:15.223 --> 01:38:16.757
Louisa.

01:38:22.463 --> 01:38:23.497
Daddy?

01:38:23.564 --> 01:38:25.632
Louisa.

01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:27.134
l can come home now?

01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:28.834
Yes, l will take you.

01:38:29.903 --> 01:38:31.137
Take you out of here.

01:39:18.319 --> 01:39:22.890
