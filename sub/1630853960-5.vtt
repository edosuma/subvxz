WEBVTT

00:10.885 --> 00:11.845
Class!

00:13.013 --> 00:14.097
Class!

00:14.180 --> 00:15.015
Class!

00:17.225 --> 00:19.519
This is Mohammed.

00:20.228 --> 00:22.313
His family is from Iraq.

00:22.897 --> 00:25.275
He just flew in from the Gulf War.

00:26.151 --> 00:29.654
We're from Palestine actually,
but I was born in Kuwait.

00:29.738 --> 00:33.033
Okay, class, let's welcome Mohammed…

00:33.116 --> 00:34.117
from…

00:34.200 --> 00:35.285
Pakistan.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.455
-Palestine.
-Why are you wearing a bow tie?

00:41.166 --> 00:44.836
Your behavior is beyond me.
Go ahead and take your seat.

00:44.919 --> 00:46.629
Okay, all right.

00:48.256 --> 00:51.926
Your momma's so stupid,
she thought a quarterback was a refund.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.595
Oh!

00:53.678 --> 00:57.932
Oh, yeah? Your momma's so fat
she uses a VCR for a pager.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.684
Oh!

01:00.560 --> 01:04.272
Your momma's so stupid,
she sat on the TV to watch the couch.

01:04.355 --> 01:06.357
Oh!

01:06.441 --> 01:10.153
Your family's so poor, I walked into your
house and said, "It's chilly outside."

01:10.236 --> 01:12.989
Your momma walked out
with a bowl and a spoon!

01:13.073 --> 01:14.741
Oh!

01:17.869 --> 01:19.913
-What're you laughing at?
-Me? Nothing.

01:19.996 --> 01:22.707
-Are you making fun of me?
-Sorry, I don't speak Spanish.

01:22.791 --> 01:26.002
-Are you messing with me, punk?
-I don't speak Spanish!

01:27.670 --> 01:30.673
-Wow, no jiggling, he's solid.
-Fight, fight, fight!

01:30.757 --> 01:34.260
Fight, fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight, fight!

01:34.844 --> 01:35.678
Mo!

01:36.554 --> 01:39.015
-Mo!
-Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!

01:39.099 --> 01:42.560
-Get off of my brother.
-Wow, bro, she's dragging you.

01:45.105 --> 01:45.939
Stop.

01:49.317 --> 01:50.360
Get outta here!

01:51.569 --> 01:52.946
-Mo?
-Nadia?

01:53.029 --> 01:55.240
You okay? Oh, my God. Come on.

02:10.797 --> 02:14.384
So what's the background for that?
Horowitz?

02:14.467 --> 02:16.052
She's Polish, Mama.

02:16.136 --> 02:20.723
You couldn't find a Palestinian lawyer.
You had to hire this Polish woman?

02:20.807 --> 02:22.976
If you want her
to take her shoes off, say so.

02:23.059 --> 02:25.436
Modad would never come in with shoes on.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.647
She says she loves your hair.

02:28.356 --> 02:29.190
Thank you.

02:29.274 --> 02:32.527
She wants you to take your shoes off,
and she wishes you weren't Polish.

02:33.444 --> 02:36.531
-That's not what she said.
-It's fine. I'm… I'm so sorry.

02:37.198 --> 02:38.825
I wasn't…

02:38.908 --> 02:41.077
Of course. I wasn't thinking. Sorry.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.330
Oh, thank you.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.917
Is the deed for the Kuwait house in here?

02:48.001 --> 02:50.461
No, my sister Nadia has that.
She used it for her case.

02:50.545 --> 02:53.756
-Why is she filing separately?
-She does everything separately.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.300
Oh, was she estranged?

02:55.842 --> 02:56.885
It's complicated.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.429
She married a White man! From Canada.

02:59.512 --> 03:00.972
-Stop!
-Oh…

03:01.556 --> 03:04.309
Well, it'd make it a lot easier
if we could get it back.

03:04.392 --> 03:07.187
-We really need it as soon as possible.
-Okay.

03:07.270 --> 03:11.107
She takes her shoes off
and then she puts her feet on the couch?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.276
She really loves your eyebrows.

03:13.359 --> 03:16.487
She said you took your shoes off,
but put your feet on the couch.

03:16.571 --> 03:17.697
Enough. Stop.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.240
-Enough.
-Enough.

03:20.408 --> 03:22.619
-Joking.

03:22.702 --> 03:23.536
Lots of jokes.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.337
It's not borrowing
if you never bring it back, Nadia.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.632
What do you mean you're busy?
You don't even work!

03:36.549 --> 03:38.551
No, that's not gonna work for me.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.304
Fine, I'll go to Galveston.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.015
May God forgive me.

03:44.098 --> 03:47.852
<i>Amor</i>, if you didn't always yell at her,
maybe she'd show a different side.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.145
Nothing's easy with Nadia.

03:49.229 --> 03:52.232
She married a Canadian for American
citizenship. Explain that to me.

03:52.315 --> 03:55.068
You can marry an American
to become an American citizen,

03:55.151 --> 03:57.278
and you're choosing not to.
Explain that to me.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.197
Are you converting? Repeat after me,

03:59.280 --> 04:02.325
I bear witness there's no God
but Allah, and I bear witness--

04:02.408 --> 04:04.827
I'm kidding!

04:05.662 --> 04:08.206
If we get married our first son
will be named Adam?

04:08.289 --> 04:10.124
-What's wrong with Adam?
-Nothing wrong.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.876
It's a beloved name. It's amazing.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.420
It's what American Arabs call their kids
when they sell out.

04:14.504 --> 04:18.007
It's much easier to pronounce
than Abbas Khalid Abubakar.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.551
It's the "ahs," "has," and "haks"
that trick up everybody.

04:20.635 --> 04:23.805
-You go by "Mo" instead of "Mohammed."
-It's a completely different situation.

04:23.888 --> 04:27.225
There's a lot of nicknames for "Mohammed."
At home, they call me Hamoodi.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.560
Back home, they call me
"Hammada," "Abo Hammed."

04:29.644 --> 04:32.647
We're not talking about me. It's Nadia
who married outside the culture.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.065
I'm outside your culture.

04:34.148 --> 04:36.985
What are you saying?
Arabs were in Spain for 700 years.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.821
If we did a cheek swab,
it'd probably come up 30% Arab.

04:39.904 --> 04:41.739
A lot of Spanish words come from Arabic.

04:41.823 --> 04:46.035
Pants, pants.
Sugar, sugar. Underwear, underwear.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.495
Burritos, shawarma.

04:47.578 --> 04:50.540
Pita bread, tortilla.
Both flat, delicious, puffy.

04:50.623 --> 04:53.876
Corn tortillas need to go though.
They're rubbery and horrible.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.088
But they gotta be super fresh.
Gotta agree with me on that--

04:57.171 --> 05:00.008
I'm serious. All this talk
about having six kids.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.635
That was all bullshit?
It's a problem for you now.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.972
-<i>Habibti</i>, it's not a problem for me.
-But it is for your mom.

05:07.181 --> 05:09.475
It's not that,
you know, complicated.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.144
It's not something else.

05:11.227 --> 05:12.812
That's the real problem.

05:13.354 --> 05:15.356
We'll talk about this some other time.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.568
-Gotta go to Galveston. I'll take this--
-Give me my tortilla.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.320
-These eggs too.
-They're not even done.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.614
Yeah, they are, baby. I love them
soft scrambled. I love you.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.919
Cinna-maple, great choice.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.881
Its blend of savory and sweet
will melt your taste buds.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.303
-<i>Salaam aleikum.</i>
<i>-Aleikum salaam.</i>

05:45.928 --> 05:48.014
I was wondering,
is your chicken halal?

05:48.097 --> 05:50.016
No, unfortunately not.

05:50.099 --> 05:54.604
-But we have fantastic fries and corn--
-That's okay, maybe next time. Um…

05:54.687 --> 05:55.772
Thank you, though.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.040
Hey, uh…

06:14.749 --> 06:15.708
Um…

06:15.792 --> 06:17.460
What are you doing, Sameer?

06:18.836 --> 06:20.254
Uh, don't worry, Curtis.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.215
It's all being documented.

06:22.298 --> 06:27.220
Yeah, uh, I think purchase orders
are usually approved first.

06:28.262 --> 06:30.473
You know, by actual vendors.

06:34.852 --> 06:38.147
It's called initiative, Curtis.
I'm going on lunch.

06:39.148 --> 06:41.109
Man, I don't… I don't know if…

06:41.192 --> 06:42.360
Are you sure you…

06:42.443 --> 06:43.486
And he's gone.

06:46.781 --> 06:47.615
Oh, boy.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.986
Mo, hi! <i>Salaam aleikum</i>!

07:25.069 --> 07:27.488
-No, we don't do that. <i>W'aleikum salaam</i>.
-Good to see you!

07:27.572 --> 07:29.866
-You can keep your shoes on, Mo.
-No, that's gross.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.909
Oh, okay. Well, come on in. Come on in.

07:33.202 --> 07:35.705
-What the hell is that?
-An African cape buffalo.

07:35.788 --> 07:38.583
Funny story,
I actually got it from the Bushes. They--

07:38.666 --> 07:40.793
-Osama, <i>Habibi</i>!
-Uncle Mo!

07:41.377 --> 07:44.464
Osama, what's up, bro?
Man, you're getting so big!

07:44.547 --> 07:46.716
-Almost as big as me.
-Not really.

07:47.925 --> 07:50.011
-So you're gonna quiz me?
-Where's our family from?

07:50.094 --> 07:51.762
-Burin.
-Solid, when is <i>Eid</i>?

07:51.846 --> 07:53.806
-Changes every year.
-That's right.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.600
-What does your name mean in Arabic?
-Lion.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.352
Did you know there are
100 ways to say lion in Arabic?

07:58.436 --> 08:01.772
-Well, it's 300.
-When was the prophet's first migration?

08:03.274 --> 08:06.110
-I ask the questions.
-Are you done interrogating my son?

08:06.194 --> 08:09.405
You mean educating? Hello.
Looking good. Good to see you too.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.033
-No, I don't have time for this shit.
-Whoa, whoa, language. We--

08:12.116 --> 08:15.244
Bob, please, will you take Osama
to the game? I'll get the snacks.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.663
-What about the deed?
-Bob, really, I got it.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.415
Okay, sorry I didn't mean to interfere--

08:19.499 --> 08:22.502
-Stop apologizing.
-Stop apologizing. You're not in Ottawa.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.378
-Okay.
-Nice teeth, Bob.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.380
-Thanks. We got good dental.
-Sure you do.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.841
-He's making fun of you.
-No, he's not.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.261
-I need the deed.
-I don't have it.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.471
Oh, you don't have it?

08:33.554 --> 08:36.265
Oh, God forbid your family gets asylum.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.185
I didn't drop everything because
you called an hour ago demanding it.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.812
-After the game.
-You're going to the game, right Uncle Mo?

08:41.896 --> 08:44.273
Of course! Why do you think
I'm dressed in your colors?

08:44.357 --> 08:47.568
-See you throw them out from shortstop.
-I'm a pitcher.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.279
That's right. Throw strikes.
Get them out.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.750
Let's go, Osama!

09:04.460 --> 09:07.463
-How's Sameer?
-He's great. He didn't sell out like you.

09:07.547 --> 09:11.008
Come on, ump, you hitting the sauce?
What? You smoking Indica?

09:11.092 --> 09:13.302
You're falling asleep over here!

09:13.386 --> 09:16.180
Don't pretend you don't smoke weed
with that ponytail!

09:16.264 --> 09:18.558
-Sorry, guys.
-How long have you been with Maria?

09:18.641 --> 09:20.685
Don't bring up my girlfriend.
You don't know anything.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.645
How's your situation
any different from mine?

09:22.728 --> 09:25.314
You kidding?
Maria is Mexican. She's basically Arab.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.651
Only thing whiter than Bob is his teeth.
He's like human whiteout.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.987
Make a boo-boo on your paper,
just…

09:31.070 --> 09:33.447
Rinse it right out.
Plus, Maria will convert.

09:34.365 --> 09:35.366
Ball!

09:35.449 --> 09:39.370
You son of a whore!
Stuff this in your ass!

09:40.037 --> 09:41.372
You're embarrassing us.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.708
They can't understand me.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.793
You keep acting like I turned
my back on the family.

09:45.876 --> 09:48.629
Has it ever once occurred to you that
the family turned its back on me?

09:48.713 --> 09:50.965
Bullshit. You didn't show up
to Dad's funeral.

09:51.048 --> 09:52.800
I was camping with Bob.

09:52.883 --> 09:56.345
I didn't have cell service.
I didn't find out until a week later.

09:58.973 --> 09:59.890
I… I didn't know.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.353
Those last few months before he died,
we weren't even talking.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.147
He was so angry about Bob.

10:06.230 --> 10:08.983
Don't even try and fucking guilt me.
I have enough as it is.

10:09.066 --> 10:11.193
Can't even bring myself
to visit his grave.

10:12.486 --> 10:13.904
You haven't been there?

10:17.366 --> 10:19.785
Maybe he would have come around
the way Mom has.

10:20.369 --> 10:23.456
-I thought you guys were barely talking.
-We talk a lot now.

10:23.539 --> 10:26.334
-She told me about your tattoo.
-And the shooting?

10:26.417 --> 10:27.293
The what?

10:27.376 --> 10:29.712
She told you about my tattoo
but not getting shot?

10:29.795 --> 10:30.963
You got shot?

10:33.341 --> 10:34.300
It was a graze.

10:36.677 --> 10:37.845
What?

10:41.515 --> 10:42.516
It's okay, Osama.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.894
We're just here to have fun, eh?

10:57.239 --> 10:58.324
Damn.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.451
It's okay. We'll get them next time.

11:01.410 --> 11:04.246
Hey, Mo, only players and coaches
allowed on the field.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.499
-Relax, Bob.
-Who the fuck is that?

11:06.582 --> 11:09.460
-What's going on, <i>habibi</i>?
-I don't know. Just off today.

11:09.543 --> 11:11.629
That's the Canadian in you.
You're Palestinian.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.923
The one thing you can do
is throw accurately.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.758
Imagine there's a tank coming at you.

11:15.841 --> 11:19.553
-There's a guy driving from a distance--
-Okay. Time to skedaddle.

11:19.637 --> 11:22.181
-Take it easy, one second.
-Come on. Hey.

11:22.264 --> 11:23.349
Your name is Osama.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.935
-Get off the field! We wanna play!
-One second.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.103
Get off the field!

11:27.186 --> 11:30.356
They're throwing tear gas at you,
grab it, and throw it back at them--

11:30.439 --> 11:32.441
-Time to skedaddle.
-Hold on, Bob!

11:32.525 --> 11:35.403
-Your name is Osama. A lion.
-Come on!

11:35.486 --> 11:37.196
-Channel that lion.
-Yeah.

11:37.279 --> 11:41.283
-You're a lion, buddy.
-You want a lion? I'll show you a lion!

11:41.367 --> 11:43.869
I can't have every parent
and uncle on the field,

11:43.953 --> 11:46.997
undermining my authority
whenever they have an opinion.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.208
These are my players, my team, mine!

11:49.291 --> 11:52.795
When I tell you to skedaddle,
you have to fucking skedaddle, eh!

11:52.878 --> 11:54.880
-I'm proud of you, Bob.
-Okay, thanks.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.717
-That's a lot of toonies in the swear jar.
-I'm sorry.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.553
-It's okay, bro. Doing great.
-Okay. Thanks.

12:03.264 --> 12:06.308
-What did you say to him?
-A little uncle pep talk.

12:08.853 --> 12:09.937
Bob…

12:10.020 --> 12:13.065
grew a pair of nuts today.
It's nice. I like him.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.016
Oh!

12:50.478 --> 12:52.021
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, shit.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.606
Osama just hurt my son!

12:53.689 --> 12:55.649
Why, Osama, why?

12:56.275 --> 12:57.777
You're out of here!

13:00.446 --> 13:03.866
I tried stopping him.
I was trying to stop him. I was…

13:03.949 --> 13:05.493
-This is all that's in here.
-Yeah.

13:05.576 --> 13:06.952
Oh, hey, Damon.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.372
-I'm glad you're here--
-This is a joke, right?

13:10.873 --> 13:11.874
What?

13:12.374 --> 13:15.294
You, taking 200 dollars
from the register to buy…

13:17.129 --> 13:18.672
-Chicken?
-No, it's halal.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.216
-"Halala"?
Yeah, halal.

13:20.299 --> 13:21.967
No, you just decided to--

13:22.051 --> 13:24.804
I realized we could get higher
quality chicken at a similar value,

13:24.887 --> 13:27.139
and at the same time
expand our customer base.

13:27.223 --> 13:30.768
I decided to take initiative because
that's what you said. Take initiative.

13:30.851 --> 13:34.688
By stealing from the register?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

13:34.772 --> 13:37.983
I didn't steal.
No, I didn't steal. I just, uh…

13:38.484 --> 13:40.027
-The note--
-Yeah, I got it.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.987
Here, look. I got the change.

13:43.280 --> 13:46.158
-This is all that's left?
-Yeah, plus the receipt.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.243
Thank you.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.329
-You're fired.
-No, no, no. I, I…

13:50.412 --> 13:52.540
Just get the fuck out of here, okay?

14:01.757 --> 14:03.551
Just get the fuck outta here, okay?

14:04.051 --> 14:06.720
-Honestly.
-Get the fuck outta here, okay?

14:06.804 --> 14:09.306
Hey, seriously, are you okay, bro?

14:09.390 --> 14:11.767
He's fine.
He's lucky I don't call the cops.

14:15.729 --> 14:16.897
You good, bro?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.234
-Sameer?

14:20.317 --> 14:22.695
Hey, calm down, buddy.
Hey, It's okay, bro.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.698
-Ah!

14:28.450 --> 14:29.952
Get the fuck outta here, okay?

14:30.035 --> 14:32.079
Just get the fuck outta here.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.290
Just get the fuck outta here.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.459
No, Sameer. Please. Just go…

14:39.920 --> 14:40.921
Sam… I…

14:41.463 --> 14:42.339
Sameer.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.718
Come on. Hey, open up, buddy.

14:45.801 --> 14:48.137
You're sorry, right?
You should shake his hand.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.054
That would be nice.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.140
Unbelievable.
How can I trust you with my kid?

14:51.223 --> 14:54.476
You talk to him for two seconds,
and he's accused of a hate crime.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.645
Nobody could see
the yarmulke under his helmet.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.189
That's not the point.
He could get kicked out of the league.

14:59.273 --> 15:02.651
With his genetics, he's more suited
to playing ice hockey or that…

15:02.735 --> 15:04.653
curling shit where they do that.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.447
-I'm getting a call.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.158
-<i>Yeah, Habibi?</i>
-Ha… Hamoodi…

15:10.701 --> 15:12.077
Ha… ha… halal chicken.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.078
What?

15:13.162 --> 15:14.163
<i>Um</i>…

15:14.663 --> 15:16.123
<i>Trouble… trouble at work.</i>

15:16.206 --> 15:18.208
Sameer, open the door, now!

15:18.292 --> 15:21.587
Look, I'll be right there.
I'll drop you off, and I'll get Sameer.

15:21.670 --> 15:25.215
-He's my brother too, I'm coming.
-Don't you have some soccer-mom shit?

15:25.299 --> 15:27.843
I wish I was a soccer mom.
I fucking hate baseball.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.762
Get the fuck outta here, okay?

15:44.735 --> 15:47.488
-Hey! Where's Sameer?
-What's going on?

15:47.988 --> 15:50.783
-He locked himself in the bathroom.
-Why? What did you do to him?

15:50.866 --> 15:51.742
I…

15:51.825 --> 15:55.788
-He fired him for buying halal chicken.
-With money he stole from the register.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.706
My brother does not steal.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.166
-Sameer?
-<i>Habibi, </i>Sameer.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.378
<i>Habibi</i>, it's me. You can come out. <i>Yalla!</i>

16:02.461 --> 16:03.712
Is the police there?

16:04.672 --> 16:08.050
-Damon said he called the police.
You called the police on my brother?

16:08.133 --> 16:09.510
No, of course not.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.805
-An illegal with Asperger's?
-Are you a psychiatrist now?

16:12.888 --> 16:15.724
-You work at Chick'n Cone.
-He's clearly on the spectrum.

16:15.808 --> 16:19.561
I don't wanna hear this from…
failed skateboarder. <i>Habibi</i>!

16:19.645 --> 16:22.022
What does he owe you
that you have to bully him?

16:22.106 --> 16:25.442
I didn't bully him, but it's 200 dollars.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.903
<i>-Habibi</i>, Nadia's here too.
-Take it all.

16:29.446 --> 16:31.490
Hi, Sameer. You're safe now.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.158
Sameer, come out.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.744
There's someplace we need to go
all three of us together.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.248
Got enough room in your car
for 30 pounds of halal chicken?

16:40.040 --> 16:45.004
Yeah, of course. Mom's gonna make
<i>maqluba </i>and <i>mloukhieh </i>and…

16:45.087 --> 16:46.922
gourmet cat food for Crystal.

16:47.589 --> 16:48.465
For Crystal?

16:50.342 --> 16:51.176
Yeah.

16:54.513 --> 16:55.347
All right.

17:07.276 --> 17:10.154
-Where are we going?
-Someplace special. Come on.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.573
-Hi.
-Hi.

17:21.999 --> 17:22.875
You…

17:23.959 --> 17:24.960
Fuck you.

17:26.462 --> 17:27.796
You're a piece of shit.

17:29.381 --> 17:32.676
-Did he just threaten to fingerbang me?
-I think so.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.554
Peace and blessings
upon you, people of the grave.

17:35.637 --> 17:38.015
-How are you feeling? You okay?
-Hungry.

17:38.682 --> 17:40.893
-We'll go get a bite after.
-Okay.

17:40.976 --> 17:41.810
Over here.

17:41.894 --> 17:46.356
Peace and blessings upon you,
people of the grave.

17:49.568 --> 17:50.569
It's right here.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.906
-Where?
-Here, here.

17:54.406 --> 17:58.327
It's right of the left tree.
Left center of the middle tree. Here.

17:59.620 --> 18:03.290
-Uh, there's no headstone.
-Yeah, that's how we know he's here.

18:03.373 --> 18:06.877
-Why didn't you get him a headstone?
-I don't know, I was 12, Nadia.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.338
I was too busy worrying about biology
and asking Allie out.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.839
-Who's Allie?
-Remember her?

18:10.923 --> 18:13.175
I had a crush on her in 7th grade.
She broke my heart.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.676
We could be standing on him.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.471
Don't be ridiculous.
We're not standing on him.

18:18.305 --> 18:21.433
Actually, we might be standing on him.
Step back a little bit.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.852
Here. That's good.
In the Name of Allah.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.480
<i>-Habi</i>, why don't you lead the prayer?
-Okay.

18:26.563 --> 18:29.733
It'll be nice. It will cleanse your heart.
It was a rough day.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.735
In the Name of Allah.

18:32.694 --> 18:37.449
Um, O Allah! Let those of us to whom
you have given life, live in Islam,

18:37.533 --> 18:38.408
and…

18:39.993 --> 18:44.289
-And…
-Take your time. No rush.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.749
And let those of us--

18:45.833 --> 18:50.045
Peace be upon the inhabitants
of this place among believers and Muslims.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.923
Soon we will join you, Allah willing.

18:53.465 --> 18:56.260
I ask Allah to keep us,
and you, safe and sound.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.721
In the Name of Allah,
the Gracious, the Merciful.

19:00.222 --> 19:06.186
-Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds…
-Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds…
