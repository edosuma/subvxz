WEBVTT

00:01.101 --> 00:03.865
My father worked as a lawyer
for the richest family in New York,

00:03.937 --> 00:06.303
until his plane went down
in long island sound.

00:06.372 --> 00:08.636
He left me his biggest client,
the Darlings.

00:08.708 --> 00:10.141
Tripp, the empire builder.

00:10.210 --> 00:12.474
Letitia, the sophisticated socialite.

00:12.545 --> 00:14.103
Karen, the professional divorcee.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.875
- I want to marry Nick.
- Let me help you.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.041
Brian, the man of God.

00:17.117 --> 00:19.642
- What about Brian Jr?
- I'm taking him back to Brazil.

00:19.719 --> 00:21.846
You can't just uproot him.
He has a life here now.

00:21.921 --> 00:23.616
Patrick,
the principled politician.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.181
The three of us are going to sit down
together and set some ground rules.

00:26.259 --> 00:27.954
- You, me, and who?
- Carmelita.

00:28.027 --> 00:30.188
And Jeremy and Juliet,
the well-behaved twins.

00:30.263 --> 00:32.390
- I want a job.
- What can you do?

00:33.233 --> 00:35.098
You will not believe
the girl whose car I'm parking.

00:35.168 --> 00:38.103
Darling Plaza was our first home
in Manhattan.

00:38.171 --> 00:41.072
Convince Tripp to throw Darling Plaza
into the pot.

00:41.141 --> 00:44.668
It is Simon elder
who has stolen my son.

00:44.744 --> 00:46.075
I want to destroy him.

00:54.687 --> 00:56.848
- Good morning.
- Hey.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.489
You ready to paint the living room?

01:01.594 --> 01:05.928
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I love painting.
I love the mess, I love the smell.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.791
Okay. Which one?

01:09.769 --> 01:11.669
All right, let me see.

01:14.040 --> 01:17.373
- Creme brulee or flan?
- Yeah, it's a custard theme.

01:18.011 --> 01:20.502
Are you sure you're going to be able
to finish this before Thanksgiving

01:20.580 --> 01:22.309
at my parents'? It's only two days.

01:22.382 --> 01:24.247
Yeah.
Yeah, I have very little to do today.

01:24.317 --> 01:26.615
I just have to meet with Tripp briefly

01:26.686 --> 01:28.347
and help Brian
with his custody hearing

01:28.421 --> 01:31.982
and then I am free
for the entire holiday weekend.

01:32.058 --> 01:34.618
Five days without Nick George.

01:34.727 --> 01:37.560
Won't the Darling dynasty crumble
into dust without you?

01:37.630 --> 01:39.495
It just might.

01:39.566 --> 01:42.126
But it would be very expensive dust.

01:47.974 --> 01:51.000
- Anything going on with Darling Plaza?
- Not yet.

01:51.077 --> 01:53.238
We transferred the deed over
to Simon elder two weeks ago.

01:53.346 --> 01:56.213
He's given me no indication
of his plans.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.182
Is that it then?

01:58.251 --> 02:00.378
He just wanted to steal my soul?

02:00.453 --> 02:04.219
Rob me of the building
where my kids were raised?

02:04.290 --> 02:06.986
Rob me of my son? My son, Nick.

02:07.060 --> 02:10.826
- Have you heard from Patrick lately?
- Not since the wedding.

02:12.065 --> 02:14.556
He hasn't returned any of my calls.

02:16.703 --> 02:20.161
You can't imagine what it's like, Nicky.

02:20.240 --> 02:23.175
Come to the end of your life.

02:23.243 --> 02:26.178
So many years of work.

02:26.246 --> 02:28.271
So many years of achievement.

02:28.348 --> 02:33.513
And then right in front of your face,
it's all being spirited away

02:33.586 --> 02:36.612
by this capricious man.

02:36.689 --> 02:41.058
Patrick is still your son, Tripp.
No matter what kind of political alliance

02:41.127 --> 02:46.087
he forms with Simon elder,
for whatever reason, he's still your son.

02:47.367 --> 02:49.062
Yeah.

02:49.135 --> 02:53.902
Arrange a sit-down with Patrick
and Simon elder for me, will you?

02:54.007 --> 02:55.770
A sit-down. Okay.

02:55.842 --> 03:00.006
The sooner, the better.
Tomorrow evening, up at Valhalla.

03:00.113 --> 03:03.378
Wait, Tripp. You expect him to leave
the city the day before Thanksgiving

03:03.449 --> 03:06.384
and go 60 Miles up the
Hudson river valley for a sit-down? I...

03:06.452 --> 03:09.012
You handed him the deed
to Darling Plaza

03:09.088 --> 03:11.522
to gain influence with him, right?

03:11.591 --> 03:12.615
Yeah.

03:12.692 --> 03:16.355
So, use your influence. Cash it in.

03:17.497 --> 03:19.260
All right. I'm on it.

03:21.567 --> 03:24.001
You'll be there at my side, okay?

03:26.239 --> 03:29.265
Tripp, it's Thanksgiving weekend.
I made plans with the family. I...

03:29.342 --> 03:32.903
I'll get you out really early
Thursday morning. Promise.

03:34.347 --> 03:35.712
What do you want me
to tell Patrick to...

03:35.782 --> 03:38.808
Just tell him Simon elder will be there.

03:38.885 --> 03:43.151
That'll make him feel safe.
You leave the rest up to his vanity.

03:44.157 --> 03:46.455
How much longer
are we gonna be staying at this hotel?

03:46.526 --> 03:49.290
Living out of a suitcase,
eating room service all the time.

03:49.362 --> 03:50.989
It's a little tiresome.

03:52.198 --> 03:54.666
Thank you for being so patient.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.759
Have you set up the meeting
with Carmelita yet?

04:00.373 --> 04:05.470
I'm not sure this is the best time
for her. She's got finals coming up.

04:05.545 --> 04:10.676
- Oh, she's in school. What school?
- Cosmetology.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.241
Well, it's always something, isn't it?

04:13.319 --> 04:15.787
When would be a good time for her?

04:15.855 --> 04:17.914
What is it you wanna talk about?

04:17.990 --> 04:19.355
Just make it happen.

04:19.459 --> 04:22.895
If you want to stay married to me,
quit stalling and make it happen.

04:22.962 --> 04:25.123
- I understand, but...
- Today.

04:27.367 --> 04:28.459
Okay.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.602
Thank you for coming
on such short notice, Giorgio.

04:36.709 --> 04:40.543
Any time you get divorced, Karen,
I'm here for you.

04:40.613 --> 04:45.778
But, you know, we don't have to do this
only after you get divorced.

04:45.852 --> 04:48.616
Yeah, actually, we kind of do.

04:54.660 --> 04:56.321
Was that Giorgio?

04:57.897 --> 04:59.865
What a trouper.
Always being there for you like that.

04:59.932 --> 05:02.867
- It's really, like, inspiring.
- It takes a village.

05:02.935 --> 05:06.393
Something was off last night, though.
It wasn't the same.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.201
Do tell.

05:08.274 --> 05:12.210
Well, usually when Giorgio and I have

05:12.278 --> 05:16.180
meaningless, post-divorce sex,
it feels a little less meaningless,

05:16.249 --> 05:17.807
like we're somehow...

05:17.917 --> 05:21.648
Planets whose orbits intersect
every 10 years?

05:21.721 --> 05:27.023
No. Just hornier. Oh, well.
You gonna eat those?

05:27.093 --> 05:29.323
No, replenish.

05:29.395 --> 05:33.161
- What's the matter with you?
- I miss my son.

05:33.232 --> 05:34.859
Brian Jr. left? Where'd he go?

05:34.934 --> 05:38.301
His mother came
and took him away a week ago, Karen.

05:38.371 --> 05:40.032
I'm fighting for custody.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.668
Brian? Hey, look, you...

05:43.743 --> 05:45.802
You know
how the justice system works.

05:45.878 --> 05:48.711
Whoever has the most money wins,
right?

05:48.781 --> 05:50.510
You've got nothing to worry about.

05:50.583 --> 05:53.313
Well, thanks for the advice.

05:53.386 --> 05:55.354
Thanks for the pancakes.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.518
Was Brian wearing
clive Christian no. 1?

06:00.626 --> 06:02.594
Nah, that's me.

06:02.695 --> 06:05.459
And it's no. 2, unreleased to the public.

06:05.531 --> 06:06.862
Why are you wearing cologne?

06:06.933 --> 06:08.093
There's this girl
who parks at the garage.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.829
She won't go out with me.
She thinks I'm, like, just a valet.

06:10.903 --> 06:12.803
Oh, so you're gonna knock her
unconscious with your cologne

06:12.872 --> 06:14.840
and then, what? Shanghai her?

06:14.907 --> 06:17.341
- Just tell her you're Jeremy Darling.
- No.

06:17.410 --> 06:19.537
Natalie pretended to be pregnant
just to get my money.

06:19.612 --> 06:21.580
I want this girl to like me for me.

06:21.681 --> 06:25.014
Honey, that's not gonna happen.
You're a Darling.

06:25.084 --> 06:28.451
As soon as she finds that out,
things are never gonna be the same.

06:28.521 --> 06:29.818
Trust me.

06:31.157 --> 06:33.921
I guess she can never find out then.

06:33.993 --> 06:35.927
That is a good plan.

06:35.995 --> 06:38.964
Good plan, my friend.

06:39.031 --> 06:40.658
He's not asking you
to move back in.

06:40.733 --> 06:44.464
He's not asking you to do anything
except sit down with him

06:44.537 --> 06:47.005
and Simon and talk.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.541
Well, Nick, that's the last thing on earth
I would ever consider doing.

06:49.609 --> 06:50.837
I know.

06:52.111 --> 06:53.578
But, Patrick, he is your father.

06:53.646 --> 06:54.772
It's taken me over 30 years

06:54.847 --> 06:56.815
to muster the courage
to break free from him.

06:56.916 --> 07:00.283
I'm not about to go running back
into shooting range.

07:00.353 --> 07:01.445
Okay.

07:03.623 --> 07:05.250
But I'll do it.

07:06.492 --> 07:11.054
I'll do it, okay?
I just need one little favor.

07:12.832 --> 07:14.766
She just wants to talk.

07:14.834 --> 07:17.462
I can't do it. I can't face her.

07:17.537 --> 07:19.596
I'm sorry. Tell Patrick no.

07:19.672 --> 07:22.402
Carmelita, just put yourself
in Ellen's shoes, just for a second.

07:22.475 --> 07:24.500
She's not asking Patrick
to end the affair,

07:24.577 --> 07:25.908
she's not asking you to vanish.

07:25.978 --> 07:28.344
She just wants to talk.
I mean, who knows?

07:28.414 --> 07:31.383
Maybe the three of you can somehow,

07:31.450 --> 07:34.578
- I don't know, complete each other.
- You really think that's possible?

07:34.654 --> 07:38.715
Well, I think that life is very creative
and surprising

07:38.791 --> 07:42.750
and sometimes we find solutions
where we thought there weren't any.

07:42.862 --> 07:46.423
Patrick is so lucky
to have someone like you in his life.

07:49.235 --> 07:51.396
- I'll do it.
- Good.

07:51.470 --> 07:54.837
A sit-down?
- Well, that's what he called it.

07:54.907 --> 07:56.932
Okay. And what are the terms?

07:57.009 --> 07:58.374
No terms.

07:58.477 --> 08:02.174
Well, because it sounds so old-world,
I figured there must be terms.

08:02.248 --> 08:05.183
No. Just the three of you sitting down
to talk. And me.

08:05.251 --> 08:08.220
Okay. Does this have anything to do
with the Darling Plaza?

08:08.287 --> 08:10.152
I don't think so.
I think it has to do with the fact

08:10.222 --> 08:11.712
he feels he's lost his son to you.

08:11.791 --> 08:14.692
That's what he's troubled about
right now.

08:14.760 --> 08:18.890
Okay, so you're being straight
with me about this little sit-down?

08:18.965 --> 08:20.398
You promise me
that I'm not going to be walking

08:20.466 --> 08:24.027
into some sort of classic
Tripp Darling ambush?

08:24.103 --> 08:25.434
Yeah, I promise.

08:26.872 --> 08:28.806
Yeah. Okay. I'll go.

08:28.874 --> 08:31.638
- Actually, I think it could be beneficial.
- Good.

08:31.711 --> 08:33.611
It's not every day
two men like us sit down

08:33.679 --> 08:36.842
and break bread together.
Should be interesting.

08:36.948 --> 08:38.006
Done.

08:57.064 --> 08:59.430
I think we can all agree
it's in everyone's best interest

08:59.500 --> 09:01.798
to settle this
without going to the judge tomorrow.

09:01.869 --> 09:04.804
What you think, Mr. George,
is beside the point.

09:04.872 --> 09:08.330
My client's settling for nothing less
than sole physical and legal custody.

09:08.409 --> 09:10.377
Are you out of your freaking mind?

09:10.445 --> 09:12.106
I know what's best for my child.

09:12.180 --> 09:14.512
Says the tramp who slept with me
last week to get him back.

09:14.582 --> 09:17.346
- Brian, let me handle this.
- Then handle it!

09:17.418 --> 09:19.511
Given Brian Jr. 's feelings for his father,

09:19.587 --> 09:22.715
do you think that moving to Brazil
is really what's best for him?

09:22.790 --> 09:25.850
These two have bonded since
you first deposited your son with Brian

09:25.927 --> 09:27.485
and then subsequently disappeared.

09:27.595 --> 09:31.258
Was this before or after he deposited
the child with you?

09:31.332 --> 09:33.357
Beat it, you prissy little creep.

09:33.434 --> 09:37.063
Brian, let's just cool it, okay?
Let's just stop.

09:37.138 --> 09:40.904
I think I have come up with what is
a very fair proposal for joint custody.

09:40.975 --> 09:43.466
You'll be well compensated,
provided you stay in the city,

09:43.544 --> 09:45.910
and it puts
your son's best interests first.

09:45.980 --> 09:47.413
I'll give you one million dollars
to get up

09:47.482 --> 09:48.642
and walk out of here right now.

09:48.716 --> 09:49.774
Excuse me?

09:49.851 --> 09:51.819
Hey. That's not what we're here
to do, Brian. Let me finish.

09:51.886 --> 09:54.912
- Two million.
- Are you trying to buy my son?

09:54.989 --> 09:56.650
I'm trying to buy our son.

09:56.724 --> 10:00.421
- Nobody is buying anybody.
- This is ridiculous. We're leaving.

10:00.495 --> 10:01.826
Three million.

10:01.896 --> 10:04.865
We both know it's all about the money
with you anyway.

10:04.966 --> 10:08.663
Now I remember
why it didn't work with us.

10:08.736 --> 10:10.795
You are not a human being.

10:16.177 --> 10:18.338
Don't look at me like that.

10:18.446 --> 10:20.812
Three million was more than fair.

10:23.417 --> 10:24.782
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:25.953 --> 10:27.614
How you doing, baby?

10:28.823 --> 10:31.348
This better not be your way
of saying you're missing Thanksgiving.

10:31.425 --> 10:34.553
- I am not missing Thanksgiving.
- Good.

10:35.763 --> 10:38.527
I just have to postpone
the painting until the weekend

10:38.633 --> 10:41.295
and I'm gonna catch up with you
and Kiki at your parents'.

10:41.369 --> 10:43.337
I have to go up to
the Darlings' country house tomorrow.

10:43.437 --> 10:45.701
Tripp is having a sit-down
with Patrick and Simon elder.

10:45.773 --> 10:48.037
He wants me there and I'm sorry.

10:48.109 --> 10:49.576
You know what? It's okay.

10:49.644 --> 10:51.373
- Okay?
- Yeah, I knew you wouldn't get to it.

10:51.445 --> 10:52.412
So maybe I'll start painting,

10:52.513 --> 10:53.946
'cause I'd like it done
before the holidays,

10:54.015 --> 10:55.710
because, you know, I actually care.

10:55.783 --> 10:57.683
Hey, Lisa, you know what?
Why don't you come with me?

10:57.752 --> 10:59.583
We'll drop Kiki off at your folks first

10:59.654 --> 11:02.122
and then this weekend
we'll all paint together.

11:02.189 --> 11:04.350
I am not going to stay
in the same house as the Darlings.

11:04.458 --> 11:05.482
Italy was bad enough.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.619
- Oh, come on, Lisa.
- I am not gonna stay the night

11:07.695 --> 11:09.060
at the same place
you and Karen Darling

11:09.163 --> 11:10.994
spent a dozen magical summers
together.

11:11.065 --> 11:12.089
You know what? How about you go?

11:12.166 --> 11:14.896
You enjoy a nice, long weekend with
her and I will stay here and I will paint.

11:14.969 --> 11:17.335
Lisa, I don't particularly want to go,
but I have to.

11:17.438 --> 11:20.464
And since I have to,
I would like you to come with me.

11:26.981 --> 11:28.243
Coming right up.

11:28.316 --> 11:30.250
Actually...

11:30.318 --> 11:32.445
Is it possible
to leave my car here overnight?

11:32.520 --> 11:35.546
I think I drank a little too much wine
at dinner.

11:35.623 --> 11:37.147
I'm so on board with that.

11:37.224 --> 11:38.657
You know, both myself and the garage

11:38.726 --> 11:41.593
encourage responsible,
yet heavy, drinking.

11:41.662 --> 11:45.689
Okay. Wonderful. Thank you.
I'll just go and take a cab now.

11:48.302 --> 11:49.769
Whoa! Hey.

11:49.837 --> 11:51.998
Let me help you out there.

11:53.140 --> 11:55.404
What do you got going on in there?

11:55.476 --> 11:57.706
French fries with truffle oil.

11:57.778 --> 11:59.211
You know, I could just drive you home.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.305
That way you have your car
in the morning.

12:01.382 --> 12:03.282
- I don't think so.
- Come on. I'll cab it home.

12:03.351 --> 12:06.218
No muss, no fuss. In and out. Boom.

12:07.855 --> 12:11.018
That's so sweet of you.
It would help me out a lot.

12:11.125 --> 12:14.151
Well, I will go fetch your chariot.

12:14.962 --> 12:17.453
Why do I have to come to Valhalla
for Thanksgiving?

12:17.531 --> 12:18.862
Brian's not gonna be there.

12:18.933 --> 12:20.867
Your brother Brian has
a custody hearing.

12:20.935 --> 12:24.268
He's presiding over two funerals
this weekend.

12:24.338 --> 12:28.172
The holiday season die-off
has commenced.

12:28.242 --> 12:32.008
I told you I'd help you with Nick,
so trust me. Just come.

12:32.079 --> 12:36.709
What if daddy sends me and Nick
to India? Oh, no, wait, Bali.

12:36.784 --> 12:39.753
To set up an orphanage
for the really starving children.

12:39.854 --> 12:43.915
And we'd have to live alone,
in a grass hut, on the beach.

12:43.991 --> 12:45.322
As wonderful as that sounds,

12:45.393 --> 12:48.123
coming to Valhalla is
all you really need to do.

12:48.195 --> 12:51.062
She'll be there, won't she?

12:52.299 --> 12:53.926
I haven't the faintest idea.

12:54.001 --> 12:57.562
Oh, she will. Of course she will.
She's his wife.

12:57.638 --> 12:59.606
It's so her to come along, isn't it?

12:59.707 --> 13:03.973
Just relax, my dear.
Everything is gonna work itself out.

13:06.647 --> 13:09.810
Door to door.
Service with a smile.

13:09.917 --> 13:11.646
Thank you for this.

13:16.357 --> 13:18.985
Boy, Brooklyn is far away.

13:19.060 --> 13:24.123
I mean, I forgot how far it is.
It's like a whole other world.

13:26.233 --> 13:27.894
Are you gonna be all right
getting home?

13:27.968 --> 13:29.936
Yeah, yeah. Like I said, I'll call a cab.

13:30.037 --> 13:34.064
Maybe I'll hobo and hop a boxcar.

13:34.141 --> 13:38.805
- The subway's two blocks away.
- Right. Yeah. The subway.

13:38.879 --> 13:40.574
There you go.

13:40.648 --> 13:42.013
Listen, Sofia.

13:42.116 --> 13:44.448
The answer is yes.

13:44.518 --> 13:47.282
- To what?
- I will go out with you.

13:48.422 --> 13:50.890
But I don't even know your last name.

13:50.958 --> 13:53.620
Well, I don't...
I don't even know your last name.

13:53.694 --> 13:55.753
I'm Sofia Montoya.
And you're Jeremy...

13:55.830 --> 13:57.957
I'm cool with just Jeremy, babe...

13:59.667 --> 14:02.602
...eson. Jeremy Babeson.

14:02.670 --> 14:03.830
Babeson?

14:03.938 --> 14:06.634
Yeah. Well, you know,
it's a common American last name.

14:06.707 --> 14:12.009
It's right on all those lists beside
Smith, wong and white.

14:12.079 --> 14:15.742
Well, thank you again for the ride.

14:16.250 --> 14:18.377
And I'll see you tomorrow,

14:18.452 --> 14:21.546
Jeremy Babeson.

14:21.622 --> 14:23.351
Yes. Yes, you will.

14:35.736 --> 14:39.103
Hey, hey, Clark?
Do you mind coming to get me?

14:39.173 --> 14:42.939
I am somewhere in Brooklyn.

14:48.783 --> 14:50.080
You're sure about this, right?

14:50.151 --> 14:52.984
What're you gonna do,
not answer the door?

14:59.126 --> 15:02.687
Well, isn't this something?

15:02.763 --> 15:06.597
- Ellen, I've heard a lot about you.
- I wish I could say the same.

15:06.667 --> 15:09.500
Unfortunately, I've been kept
completely in the dark.

15:09.570 --> 15:12.733
I have, too. In a sense.

15:14.008 --> 15:15.236
Come in.

15:21.415 --> 15:22.575
Please.

15:40.863 --> 15:42.091
You can have one Saturday night
a month

15:42.164 --> 15:44.098
but the rest of the weekends are ours.

15:44.166 --> 15:45.690
You can have one Tuesday
or Wednesday night,

15:45.768 --> 15:48.066
every other week to do whatever it is
that the two of you do,

15:48.137 --> 15:51.573
as long as he is home in time
to put the kids to bed before he does it.

15:51.640 --> 15:56.668
That's less than I get him now.
So why, exactly, would I do this?

15:56.746 --> 15:59.306
Because it's more
than you'll ever have otherwise.

15:59.415 --> 16:00.905
Trust me.

16:00.983 --> 16:03.611
Starting now, this is the new normal.

16:03.686 --> 16:06.655
Sweetheart, are you sure you wanna...

16:06.722 --> 16:10.453
Please, pat, stay out of it.

16:10.526 --> 16:12.892
Don't you think I should participate
in this conversation?

16:12.995 --> 16:15.225
Patrick, maybe you should take a walk.

16:15.297 --> 16:16.264
Um...

16:16.932 --> 16:18.024
Okay.

16:20.302 --> 16:21.428
Okay.

16:28.744 --> 16:31.474
He'll spend holidays with us.
Family birthdays.

16:31.547 --> 16:35.813
And, obviously, all campaign related
events are completely off-limits.

16:35.885 --> 16:40.845
The only way that this is gonna work
is if I get him two nights every week

16:40.923 --> 16:43.619
or Patrick's gonna end up sneaking out

16:43.692 --> 16:46.923
and neither one of us wants that,
do we?

16:49.999 --> 16:52.024
Family is the only thing
that matters to me.

16:52.101 --> 16:55.434
And, as the arbitrator in this case,
I'm sure you can appreciate that.

16:55.504 --> 16:57.870
And that's why I believe,
as a father and a minister,

16:57.940 --> 16:59.703
that I should share custody
with Brian Jr.

16:59.809 --> 17:03.267
And she should not be able
to whisk him away to frigging Brazil.

17:04.012 --> 17:08.882
Thank you, reverend Darling,
for your forthrightness. Mr. Mitchell?

17:11.353 --> 17:14.253
Reverend Darling, who is Gustav?

17:15.858 --> 17:17.621
Go ahead. Tell him.

17:19.795 --> 17:24.925
Gustav is my pet name for Brian Jr.
it's like a nickname, kind of.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.059
Nickname, really?

17:27.136 --> 17:28.501
Yeah.

17:28.570 --> 17:32.063
That's a rather unremarkable
occurrence between a father and son.

17:32.141 --> 17:34.439
Is it true you forced Brian Jr.
to lie to your wife

17:34.510 --> 17:38.810
and pretend he was a Swedish orphan
whose parents died in a car accident?

17:38.881 --> 17:40.644
- No.
- No?

17:40.716 --> 17:43.651
It was a bullet train accident, not a car.
Get your facts straight.

17:43.719 --> 17:45.846
But you did make him lie.

17:45.921 --> 17:46.979
No!

17:48.157 --> 17:50.717
I offered him an opportunity
to work with me,

17:50.826 --> 17:53.590
to smooth the way towards building
a new family structure

17:53.696 --> 17:56.859
by soft-pedaling, as it were,
the nature of his involvement with me

17:56.966 --> 17:58.593
and by making it a fun game.

17:58.667 --> 18:00.567
Isn't it also true, reverend Darling,

18:00.636 --> 18:03.469
that you kept Brian Jr.
on a diet of Swedish foods,

18:03.539 --> 18:06.303
including fermented milk and reindeer?

18:06.375 --> 18:07.865
It was once. It was a one day thing.

18:07.943 --> 18:10.503
And didn't you forbid him
to tell the truth to your wife

18:10.613 --> 18:14.276
until he was so paralyzed by fear
and guilt of hellfire and damnation

18:14.350 --> 18:16.375
that he had to confess
the truth himself?

18:17.820 --> 18:19.048
I need help.

18:19.221 --> 18:22.122
I've got
this little romantic rendezvous tonight

18:22.191 --> 18:26.457
and I was wondering if you could
hook me up with a place to eat.

18:26.528 --> 18:27.620
A restaurant?

18:27.696 --> 18:29.664
This girl I like,
she doesn't know who I am, you know?

18:29.765 --> 18:32.666
She thinks
I'm this normal parking attendant

18:32.735 --> 18:35.795
and, you know,
I just wanna keep it that way.

18:35.871 --> 18:36.838
Ah.

18:37.373 --> 18:41.332
So, where do people like you go out?

18:42.978 --> 18:44.002
People like me?

18:44.079 --> 18:46.445
Yeah, you know, like, poor people.

18:46.515 --> 18:50.042
Where do you eat when you go out?

18:50.119 --> 18:52.952
You know, Jeremy,
I actually make a pretty decent living

18:53.022 --> 18:54.353
working for your family.

18:54.423 --> 18:56.323
I've seen you eating your bag lunch.

18:56.392 --> 18:57.689
And, you know,
I don't know what's going on

18:57.760 --> 19:00.228
with the whole silent
movie star mustache,

19:00.296 --> 19:04.255
but it seems pretty poverty related.

19:04.333 --> 19:08.599
You're right, Jeremy,
I can't actually afford a beard.

19:10.005 --> 19:11.734
That's a good one.

19:12.541 --> 19:15.704
In the interest of full poor disclosure,

19:15.778 --> 19:19.339
Maureen and I do enjoy, occasionally,

19:19.415 --> 19:24.375
going out for pizza or for a walk
down the Brooklyn promenade.

19:24.453 --> 19:28.116
That's sweet and simple. I like it.

19:28.190 --> 19:32.251
Sometimes, after, we'll take
a bottle of wine up on the roof.

19:32.328 --> 19:38.028
And if the stars are out
and the mood hits us,

19:39.268 --> 19:41.395
well, you know us poor people.

19:41.470 --> 19:43.199
You do the deed Al fresco?

19:44.640 --> 19:46.938
- Yep.
- Clarksdale!

19:47.009 --> 19:51.275
You're like the fountain
of middle-class romance formation!

19:51.347 --> 19:53.042
I've been called that before.

19:57.252 --> 19:59.584
You should prepare yourself, Brian.
We may lose.

19:59.655 --> 20:02.818
Do you think? You're the worst.

20:02.925 --> 20:05.257
- Did you even go to law school?
- What did you want me to do?

20:05.327 --> 20:08.660
You've lied about this kid from day one,
Brian, and everybody knows it.

20:09.365 --> 20:10.730
I'm sorry I can't change reality.

20:10.799 --> 20:12.096
Well, then you suck.

20:12.167 --> 20:14.533
I had a plan and you sabotaged me
every step of the way.

20:14.603 --> 20:16.434
Just go out there
and get them back in here

20:16.505 --> 20:18.439
and get a retrial
or a mistrial or something.

20:18.507 --> 20:19.872
This isn't a trial.

20:19.942 --> 20:21.773
The arbitrator makes her
recommendation to the judge

20:21.844 --> 20:25.211
based on testimony, and your little
performance in here didn't help.

20:25.314 --> 20:27.976
The fact is Andrea raised Brian
for seven years

20:28.050 --> 20:29.415
and you had him for two months.

20:29.485 --> 20:31.510
And you made him pretend
to be Swedish.

20:31.587 --> 20:33.487
So why don't you let me worry
about the law.

20:33.555 --> 20:35.580
Go see Andrea, alone.
Reason with her.

20:35.657 --> 20:38.091
Make her understand how you feel
about Brian.

20:38.160 --> 20:42.722
She's his mother.
She wants him to be happy. Good luck.

20:47.302 --> 20:48.667
Hey, what are you doing?

20:48.771 --> 20:51.433
Hey. I don't think there is
an article of clothing Kiki owns

20:51.507 --> 20:53.441
that she is not taking with her.

20:53.509 --> 20:55.477
- Taking where?
- To my parents'.

20:55.711 --> 20:58.339
We'll drop her off. I'm going with you
to the country house.

20:58.447 --> 21:00.278
- You decided to come with me?
- Mmm-hmm.

21:00.549 --> 21:02.039
- You sure?
- Yes.

21:02.151 --> 21:05.245
I am not gonna let the Darling drama
rob me of a chance to breathe

21:05.320 --> 21:07.584
- some clean air with my husband.
- Good.

21:29.311 --> 21:30.642
Wow.

21:30.712 --> 21:32.805
Yeah, and they only use it,
like, four times a year.

21:34.716 --> 21:37.150
Oh, leave those. Albert will get them.

21:37.219 --> 21:38.584
- Told you she'd come.
- It'll be fine.

21:38.687 --> 21:40.621
- Told you she'd come.
- It'll be fine.

21:40.689 --> 21:42.316
- Hi, dear.
Hi.

21:43.892 --> 21:45.018
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi.

21:45.094 --> 21:47.562
How lovely to have you here.

21:50.833 --> 21:53.563
Wow, would you look at that?

21:55.404 --> 21:57.702
Oh, here we go.

22:01.877 --> 22:06.507
Oh, hello. Well, you must be Simon.

22:06.582 --> 22:08.607
It is a pleasure to meet you.

22:09.284 --> 22:10.649
Patrick!

22:11.587 --> 22:12.884
Hello, mother.

22:14.189 --> 22:15.656
- Great to see you.
- Simon.

22:15.724 --> 22:17.191
- How are you?
- This is my wife, Lisa.

22:17.259 --> 22:18.624
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:18.727 --> 22:20.285
And this is Karen Darling.

22:20.362 --> 22:22.193
- Karen.
- Hi.

22:22.264 --> 22:24.289
- The Karen?
- Yes. Karen.

22:24.366 --> 22:27.665
I'm sure everybody could use
a little drinky-poo.

22:28.871 --> 22:31.203
Hey! You're just in time.

22:34.810 --> 22:36.038
So what are we hunting?

22:36.111 --> 22:38.739
Quail. We might get a pheasant or two.

22:38.814 --> 22:41.339
- This late in the season?
- Sure.

22:43.952 --> 22:46.318
You're not planning on shooting him,
are you?

22:46.388 --> 22:47.650
Come on, Nick.

22:48.457 --> 22:50.357
You know me better than that.

23:06.063 --> 23:08.429
The country makes everyone
so ravenous.

23:10.072 --> 23:12.700
Everything is just terrific, mother.
Thank you.

23:13.209 --> 23:14.574
You're not liking that quail?

23:14.644 --> 23:18.102
I'm all for sport hunting
and responsible wildlife management,

23:18.180 --> 23:21.547
but, actually, I don't eat meat.

23:21.651 --> 23:23.812
Oh, but that's all the yummy stuff.

23:24.153 --> 23:25.643
Do you eat anything yummy?

23:25.721 --> 23:27.416
- Down, girl.
- Shut up.

23:27.490 --> 23:30.459
Well, we can have them cook you
something else. There's trout.

23:30.526 --> 23:33.359
No, no, no. The salad is enough.
Everything is wonderful.

23:33.429 --> 23:34.453
Thank you.

23:34.530 --> 23:38.022
Lisa, you must come with me
after dinner to the east wing.

23:38.100 --> 23:40.466
I've been meaning
to show you something.

23:40.536 --> 23:43.699
A little art collection.

23:43.806 --> 23:45.637
Okay. Sounds great.

23:48.477 --> 23:51.207
It's an hour and a half wait.
Should we just go?

23:51.280 --> 23:53.305
Nah, let me see what I can do.

23:53.916 --> 23:55.076
Jeremy, it's okay.

23:55.184 --> 23:57.448
No, no. Hold on. I can be charming.

24:00.289 --> 24:01.415
Excuse me.

24:01.490 --> 24:04.391
Could you please double check
about a table for two?

24:04.760 --> 24:08.252
Actually, it looks like I might have
a table, Mr. Darling.

24:11.367 --> 24:12.732
One more thing.

24:18.708 --> 24:21.472
- Should just be a few.
- Really?

24:22.545 --> 24:24.103
Babeson, party of two.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.145
You got us a table?

24:28.250 --> 24:29.615
I told a teeny lie.

24:29.719 --> 24:32.620
- Happy Birthday to you!
- Happy Birthday to you!

24:37.259 --> 24:40.422
That was so embarrassing.
My birthday is in march.

24:40.529 --> 24:44.295
It was the only way I could get a table.
Just, you know, pretend.

24:46.669 --> 24:48.227
I'm having a great time tonight.

24:48.304 --> 24:54.641
Me, too. You know, it's kind of nice
going out on a normal date.

24:54.944 --> 24:57.845
And how does this normal date end?

24:59.215 --> 25:01.547
How about a walk on the promenade?

25:03.219 --> 25:05.380
How about we go back to your place?

25:06.922 --> 25:10.016
That is a much better idea.

25:11.026 --> 25:12.357
Except I can't.

25:12.428 --> 25:15.488
I got a friend crashing at my place
for Thanksgiving tomorrow, you know.

25:15.564 --> 25:18.590
He is a little down on his luck.

25:18.667 --> 25:20.362
Kind of poor, so...

25:21.670 --> 25:22.932
Too bad.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.467
There is another option.

25:26.542 --> 25:28.976
Isn't there some way that we can

25:29.445 --> 25:32.573
work something out just between us?

25:32.648 --> 25:34.878
Brian, it's too late for that.

25:34.950 --> 25:38.249
When that arbitrator delivers her
recommendation to the judge

25:38.320 --> 25:40.686
it's all over and I'll abide by that.

25:40.756 --> 25:42.724
Well, of course you will.
Because it's all going to go your way.

25:42.825 --> 25:43.883
Not his and not mine, yours.

25:43.959 --> 25:47.087
Brian, that first day that I met you,
at church

25:47.163 --> 25:52.191
you sat and talked with me for hours
about faith and solace.

25:52.268 --> 25:53.826
Yeah, so what about it?

25:53.936 --> 25:58.600
So you are the one who taught me
to bring my problems in life to God.

25:59.141 --> 26:01.268
Have you thought about doing that?

26:10.619 --> 26:15.454
I know this whole get-together may
seem a little old-fashioned,

26:16.559 --> 26:19.892
but I thought it was time to cut through
the haze of go-betweens

26:19.962 --> 26:21.122
and talk in person.

26:21.230 --> 26:22.993
Hey, I couldn't agree more.

26:24.800 --> 26:28.236
Paddy, I'm glad you came. Thank you.

26:28.304 --> 26:31.467
As long as everything's moving
forward, dad, I'm happy.

26:31.574 --> 26:33.098
No hard feelings.

26:33.742 --> 26:37.178
So, what are you doing with my son?

26:37.413 --> 26:39.176
- Doing?
- What?

26:39.281 --> 26:41.613
Now what is the nature
of your alliance?

26:41.684 --> 26:43.515
Hold on a second.
Are you kidding?

26:43.586 --> 26:45.679
This is none of your business
anymore, dad.

26:45.754 --> 26:48.222
- You don't have to answer that.
- No, no, no. I'm happy to. I'm ecstatic.

26:48.290 --> 26:52.351
I've simply offered myself
to Patrick as an advisor

26:52.428 --> 26:54.988
and a friend during this time
of transition.

26:55.064 --> 27:00.195
So you're not using him as a pawn
to enact revenge against me, huh?

27:00.336 --> 27:01.496
Uh.

27:01.604 --> 27:05.062
I think that Patrick's pedigree,
combined with his passion

27:05.140 --> 27:08.701
for social justice, is going to make him
a very effective senator.

27:09.211 --> 27:10.974
I'm excited to be on his team, that's all.

27:11.046 --> 27:13.514
Dad, try not to make
a fool of yourself, okay?

27:13.582 --> 27:15.482
What's this all about, Tripp?

27:17.720 --> 27:21.656
It's about the chilling heartlessness
of a man determined

27:21.724 --> 27:26.354
to tear asunder the long-standing
family ties

27:26.428 --> 27:28.362
in the course of his vendetta.

27:28.864 --> 27:32.197
Do you want to tell them why you want
to destroy my family or shall I?

27:33.903 --> 27:36.269
You know, Lisa, I...

27:36.372 --> 27:41.207
I've been meaning to apologize to you,
but I keep putting it off.

27:41.277 --> 27:45.407
You know, for the wedding.
For Karen's behavior.

27:45.481 --> 27:49.417
She can be so rash and thoughtless
sometimes. And I...

27:49.485 --> 27:52.511
I know how proud she is
and she'd never come to you herself.

27:52.588 --> 27:54.146
What are you talking about?

27:54.256 --> 27:58.955
You present yourself as a...
Some sort of modern-day Saint

27:59.028 --> 28:01.189
but that's not who you are at all.

28:01.297 --> 28:03.322
You're not motivated by benevolence.

28:03.399 --> 28:05.458
You're driven from your very core

28:05.534 --> 28:09.095
by an obsessive malevolence
against me and my family...

28:09.204 --> 28:10.228
I've got to get going.

28:10.306 --> 28:12.774
Paddy, hear this out.

28:12.841 --> 28:16.402
Tripp, none of this is personal.
It's business.

28:16.845 --> 28:23.409
So your family's history with my family
has nothing to do with it?

28:23.519 --> 28:26.147
What are you talking about, Tripp?

28:26.221 --> 28:31.158
I didn't know what his real name was
before, but as soon as I found out,

28:31.226 --> 28:33.194
everything fell into place.

28:33.262 --> 28:37.722
His parents used to work for our family,
for a long time.

28:38.534 --> 28:40.627
Do you want to continue or shall I?

28:40.703 --> 28:42.261
What happened?

28:43.238 --> 28:47.197
Oh, it was nothing, really. I'm sorry. I...

28:48.110 --> 28:51.841
Well, I assumed you knew.

28:52.014 --> 28:54.175
You and Karen have been
so chilly that...

28:54.249 --> 28:55.409
What happened?

28:55.517 --> 28:58.281
I would love to hear
what you think you know.

28:59.188 --> 29:01.918
Your father was my mother's lover.

29:02.191 --> 29:05.217
Now, that was the rumor and my father
couldn't live with those rumors,

29:05.294 --> 29:06.818
true or false.

29:06.895 --> 29:11.730
So he dismissed his parents
and they fled to the Soviet union

29:11.800 --> 29:14.166
with the belief that communism spoke

29:14.269 --> 29:17.432
more clearly to the plight
of African Americans.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.641
But it wasn't so rosy over there, was it?

29:21.610 --> 29:25.171
His family ended up
in a siberian work camp.

29:25.247 --> 29:30.514
And they died there,
leaving you an orphan.

29:31.854 --> 29:33.412
Is that true?

29:36.025 --> 29:37.686
It touches on the truth.

29:37.760 --> 29:42.857
Well, you know,
Karen was in a bit of a depression,

29:42.931 --> 29:49.894
you know, post-divorce
and a little intoxicated. And she...

29:51.540 --> 29:56.443
Well, she apparently kissed Nick
and declared her undying love for him.

29:56.512 --> 29:59.481
She can be so impulsive.

29:59.581 --> 30:01.071
No, it is the truth.

30:01.150 --> 30:04.119
And it's the truth that you hold me
personally responsible

30:04.186 --> 30:05.414
for the death of your parents.

30:05.487 --> 30:09.856
See, I don't need some desiccated,
old man to tell me my history...

30:09.925 --> 30:12.450
- Desiccated?
- Especially one who gets it all wrong.

30:12.528 --> 30:14.894
My parents didn't go to Russia
by choice.

30:15.631 --> 30:17.258
Your family forced them there.

30:17.332 --> 30:19.163
Oh, no, you've got it all wrong.

30:19.334 --> 30:20.961
I'm not dried meat.

30:21.637 --> 30:26.097
And your parents were not deported
from this country and you know it.

30:26.275 --> 30:27.435
No, no.

30:27.576 --> 30:30.136
But once their names had been
handed over to the state department,

30:30.245 --> 30:32.907
they were, for all intents and purposes,
hounded out of this country.

30:32.981 --> 30:37.213
So, yeah, their deaths lie at the feet
of your family. Completely.

30:37.286 --> 30:39.254
All right. I've heard enough.

30:39.888 --> 30:41.822
Look, I don't know who's telling
the truth here, okay?

30:41.890 --> 30:44.757
But the fact that you lured all of us
up here for this little

30:44.827 --> 30:48.194
performance of yours and then get
everyone else involved with your game.

30:48.297 --> 30:52.063
That arrogance is precisely why
I stopped trusting you years ago

30:52.134 --> 30:55.695
and why I will never trust you again!
Do you understand?

30:56.071 --> 30:58.539
If you see Ellen, tell her I've gone out.

31:03.879 --> 31:05.437
I'll head home as well.

31:06.548 --> 31:08.175
I wish this had ended differently.

31:08.250 --> 31:13.187
Well, it ended exactly as I expected it
to end, with a crafty denial.

31:13.255 --> 31:15.223
Night, Tripp.
- Good night.

31:16.158 --> 31:18.786
Well, at least it's out there
for everyone to know.

31:18.861 --> 31:20.123
Excuse me.

31:24.166 --> 31:25.463
So sick.

31:25.534 --> 31:27.866
Simon! Simon!

31:27.936 --> 31:30.200
You told me this wasn't an ambush.

31:30.272 --> 31:32.433
- I didn't know anything about it.
- You need to stop lying to me.

31:32.541 --> 31:33.667
I will not be played.

31:33.742 --> 31:34.902
No one is playing you.

31:35.010 --> 31:37.706
If that fossil wants a war,
that's exactly what he'll get.

31:37.779 --> 31:39.212
That's what you'll both get.

31:39.281 --> 31:41.374
Simon. Simon.

31:42.618 --> 31:46.748
Simon, this was all Tripp.
I had nothing to do with it.

31:47.222 --> 31:48.985
- That's the truth.
- The... oh, the truth?

31:49.091 --> 31:51.821
Well, the truth is pretty malleable
around here.

31:54.296 --> 31:57.459
All right, all right, all right. Just, listen,
if we're gonna go any further,

31:57.533 --> 32:00.502
I need to know one last time,
whether you're with me or not.

32:00.569 --> 32:02.935
Well, if all you're doing is exacting
revenge, then, no, I'm not...

32:03.005 --> 32:06.497
Nick, I'm not exacting revenge,
but Tripp Darling owning half the city

32:06.575 --> 32:09.271
is not good for the people of New York.
He is a dangerous man.

32:09.344 --> 32:12.711
Look, I know that Tripp has made some
shady business deals, but dangerous?

32:12.814 --> 32:16.181
Yes. Do you remember
Kenneth Darling, Tripp's brother?

32:16.251 --> 32:18.151
Simon, come on,
the only people who think

32:18.220 --> 32:20.711
that Tripp had anything to do
with Kenneth Darling's assassination

32:20.789 --> 32:23.121
are crackpot conspiracy theorists
on the Internet

32:23.192 --> 32:25.820
and two people who were
actually suspects in the killing.

32:25.894 --> 32:28.658
Both of whom have since
been completely discredited.

32:28.764 --> 32:30.527
Yeah. You're probably right

32:30.599 --> 32:32.897
because bad things
don't really happen.

32:33.602 --> 32:37.629
It's all just a story, right?

32:56.486 --> 32:57.544
Where's Nick?

32:57.621 --> 32:58.781
I'm not sure.

32:58.889 --> 33:02.256
Scotch? It's empty. Sorry.

33:02.359 --> 33:04.054
Were you this drunk
when you kissed my husband

33:04.127 --> 33:06.789
and told him that you loved him
at your wedding?

33:06.863 --> 33:09.593
Actually, no, I was sober.
And so was he.

33:09.666 --> 33:11.156
- Hey, there you are.
Be careful.

33:11.235 --> 33:13.795
She just found out about our kiss
at the wedding.

33:13.904 --> 33:15.565
It was not our kiss, Karen.

33:15.639 --> 33:20.201
Unbelievable. You are unbelievable.

33:22.946 --> 33:24.243
Why do you do that?

33:24.314 --> 33:26.009
I didn't tell her, Nick.

33:26.450 --> 33:28.975
I thought it was gonna be
our little secret.

33:36.693 --> 33:39.184
How did you think to come up
to this place?

33:39.263 --> 33:41.288
Well, my dad works for them.

33:41.365 --> 33:43.925
He told me they're all out of town, so...

33:44.868 --> 33:47.735
So what does Mr. Babeson do?

33:47.804 --> 33:49.066
Who?

33:49.239 --> 33:51.207
Your dad, silly. Mr. Babeson?

33:51.775 --> 33:53.640
Oh, right.

33:54.511 --> 33:57.344
He is a limo driver for this family,
the Darlings.

34:01.285 --> 34:03.185
You've never heard of them?

34:03.720 --> 34:05.745
No. Should I have?

34:06.056 --> 34:08.889
No. No, you...
No, you absolutely shouldn't have.

34:11.628 --> 34:13.789
You know what's so amazing
about you?

34:15.599 --> 34:16.657
What?

34:16.733 --> 34:18.030
Being with you.

34:18.201 --> 34:21.226
I feel like it doesn't matter
how much money I have.

34:22.039 --> 34:23.597
Or don't have.

34:25.108 --> 34:27.576
It's like it's just you and me, you know?

34:34.618 --> 34:35.949
Dear God.

34:38.322 --> 34:43.487
I don't ask you for much,
'cause I know I don't deserve much.

34:45.929 --> 34:49.695
But please help the arbitrator
to understand that I love my son.

34:52.202 --> 34:53.965
Oh! So sorry.

34:54.071 --> 34:56.335
And please give her the good sense...

34:56.973 --> 34:58.133
I think this is yours.

34:58.241 --> 35:00.300
- No, it fell out of your...
- From reverend Darling.

35:00.377 --> 35:02.937
To accept my generous donation.

35:07.317 --> 35:09.649
Thank you. Amen.

35:09.720 --> 35:11.278
So you're just going to leave right now?

35:11.355 --> 35:14.051
I'm going to my parents' house.
I need some time to regroup.

35:14.124 --> 35:17.218
Lisa, the only reason that I didn't
tell you was that I didn't want to waste

35:17.294 --> 35:20.593
our time arguing over nothing.
It was basically a peck on the cheek.

35:20.664 --> 35:21.631
Her lips, my cheek!

35:21.732 --> 35:23.996
How many times does she have to kiss
you before you put a stop to it?

35:24.067 --> 35:25.432
I can't control what Karen does.

35:25.535 --> 35:27.298
Is that going to be your excuse
when you two sleep together?

35:27.371 --> 35:28.633
She's delusional, Lisa.

35:28.705 --> 35:31.265
I've told her over and over there will
never be anything between us,

35:31.341 --> 35:32.467
but she lives in this world
where she thinks

35:32.542 --> 35:33.839
she can have anything she wants.

35:33.910 --> 35:35.400
Yeah, well there is a pattern here, Nick.

35:35.479 --> 35:37.310
And for the first time,
I feel like you are taking part in it,

35:37.381 --> 35:38.746
whether you believe it or not.
You know what?

35:38.815 --> 35:42.148
I have been pissed off at Karen,
but I have never worried about you.

35:42.219 --> 35:43.516
Now, I am.

35:44.187 --> 35:46.417
Hey, baby. What are you working on?

35:46.490 --> 35:48.014
You went to see her, didn't you?

35:50.127 --> 35:51.685
Where is she?

35:53.563 --> 35:57.465
In a motel. A few Miles from here.

36:00.704 --> 36:03.138
Could you at least take a shower?

36:03.707 --> 36:07.473
We didn't do anything. It's just, I...

36:07.577 --> 36:10.205
Look, it's been a rough night
and I needed to talk to someone.

36:11.581 --> 36:15.540
I can... I can tell her things.

36:20.090 --> 36:23.355
Well, I... Ellen...

36:23.427 --> 36:25.258
Simon left so abruptly.

36:30.434 --> 36:31.924
How was the meeting?

36:32.302 --> 36:36.739
Ultimately wearying.

36:43.480 --> 36:47.541
Sometimes I think I'm almost ready
to leave, you know?

36:49.186 --> 36:50.653
This life.

36:58.361 --> 37:00.261
I'm glad I married you.

37:01.264 --> 37:02.731
I'm glad I married you.

37:03.934 --> 37:05.561
What the hell was that?

37:18.808 --> 37:21.868
So this was not an assassination
attempt on Patrick Darling?

37:21.961 --> 37:25.226
No. This was a simple, run of the mill
hunting accident.

37:25.297 --> 37:26.321
Where are the wounds?

37:26.399 --> 37:29.425
Mr. Darling sustained injuries,
minor injuries, to his leg

37:29.502 --> 37:32.062
and he is expected to make a full
and speedy recovery.

37:32.171 --> 37:33.638
Who shot him?

37:33.806 --> 37:35.137
Nobody shot him, per se.

37:35.207 --> 37:36.333
This was an accident.

37:36.409 --> 37:37.842
Fine. Who pulled the trigger?

37:37.910 --> 37:40.743
Charlie Mickelson,
a longtime Darling family friend.

37:40.813 --> 37:42.576
He is devastated by the incident

37:42.681 --> 37:45.013
and we obviously request
that you respect his privacy.

37:45.084 --> 37:47.780
Where is Ellen Darling?
Why hasn't she been here to see him?

37:47.853 --> 37:51.584
Ellen is resting at the imperial
and she is also quite devastated.

37:51.657 --> 37:55.684
And we all hope that we can just put
this unfortunate episode behind us

37:55.761 --> 37:57.388
and enjoy the holiday as best we can.

37:57.463 --> 38:00.091
Why was the Attorney General hunting
at night?

38:00.232 --> 38:01.460
No further questions!

38:01.834 --> 38:02.960
- Jeremy.
- Clark.

38:03.035 --> 38:05.765
Looking forward to the Turkey
festivities this evening?

38:05.838 --> 38:07.396
I am. I am. I...

38:07.473 --> 38:10.840
I don't know how festive it's gonna be
with Patrick's leg in a sling,

38:10.910 --> 38:14.846
but I finally have something to be
thankful for. Let's go, Clark.

38:14.914 --> 38:16.040
Jeremy?

38:16.348 --> 38:17.372
Sofia!

38:17.450 --> 38:19.281
I didn't know you were
going to be here today.

38:19.351 --> 38:21.512
You know, Thanksgiving and all.

38:21.620 --> 38:22.985
What's all this?

38:24.223 --> 38:25.588
This? This is...

38:25.691 --> 38:28.057
Oh, of course, that's your father.

38:28.127 --> 38:30.493
How sweet of him to pick you up
from your work.

38:30.563 --> 38:32.895
Yeah, he is. He is the sweetest.

38:32.965 --> 38:36.423
He is. You are the... thank you.
Thank you, pops.

38:36.502 --> 38:37.730
What the hell's going on here?

38:37.803 --> 38:40.636
Be cool, Clark. Just know you're my
father and our last name is Babeson.

38:40.706 --> 38:41.866
Got it.

38:41.941 --> 38:45.377
Sofia, this is my dad.

38:46.846 --> 38:51.283
Oh, Babesons don't shake.
Babesons hug.

38:51.350 --> 38:53.511
Okay. How are you?

38:53.652 --> 38:55.415
I'm good.

38:58.457 --> 39:00.220
Thank you for doing this, Charlie.

39:00.292 --> 39:02.021
Happy to help out, Tripp.

39:03.496 --> 39:04.827
What did I shoot him with again?

39:04.897 --> 39:06.262
Double-barreled shotgun.

39:06.332 --> 39:09.961
Purdy. Twenty gauge. Bird shot.
Both barrels.

39:10.169 --> 39:11.727
Right.

39:12.471 --> 39:13.961
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- You, too.

39:14.039 --> 39:16.007
Tell Helen we'd love
to see her sometime.

39:16.108 --> 39:17.268
Will do.

39:18.577 --> 39:20.067
- Thank you.
- You bet.

39:23.716 --> 39:26.879
- How's Patrick doing?
- Doped up on sedatives.

39:27.653 --> 39:28.677
Ellen?

39:29.054 --> 39:30.749
Also doped up on sedatives.

39:30.823 --> 39:34.190
You know, this could be...
Well, you know.

39:34.260 --> 39:37.991
I mean, it's not going to get out, is it?
I'm just thinking of Patrick's campaign.

39:38.063 --> 39:39.690
Shouldn't be a problem.

39:42.134 --> 39:43.601
He's my son.

39:44.937 --> 39:46.302
You okay?

39:48.674 --> 39:51.006
I said I'd never lie for the family
and all of a sudden

39:51.076 --> 39:53.704
I'm making up stories for the press
about hunting accidents.

39:53.779 --> 39:56.077
Doesn't seem like a step
in the right direction.

39:56.148 --> 39:57.513
Hey.

39:58.350 --> 40:01.319
You told Dutch you were too busy
to see him and you weren't.

40:01.387 --> 40:02.684
Come on.

40:02.755 --> 40:06.020
Come on, Nick. Life's messy.

40:06.825 --> 40:09.089
Why didn't you tell me that elder's
parents worked for the family?

40:09.161 --> 40:10.924
The whole point of this
was for him to trust me.

40:10.996 --> 40:15.558
I didn't want to put you in a position
where you would have to lie.

40:15.668 --> 40:19.035
And I could not take a chance
that his faith in you

40:19.171 --> 40:21.264
would be in any way diminished.

40:21.340 --> 40:23.900
So all that was true
about elder's parents?

40:23.976 --> 40:27.343
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, he got it wrong
about my parents

40:27.413 --> 40:31.042
reporting his parents to the authorities.
That wasn't them.

40:35.721 --> 40:37.086
It was my father.

40:37.489 --> 40:41.050
Yeah. That was Dutch.

40:42.194 --> 40:44.424
My dad, he was fit to be tied.

40:44.496 --> 40:47.056
If he'd had his way, it'd...
I mean, you know, the '50s.

40:47.166 --> 40:48.895
They were different times.

40:49.501 --> 40:50.763
Dutch got into it.

40:50.836 --> 40:53.669
Got them safely put on a boat
to Russia.

40:54.974 --> 40:59.536
You know, if you're looking
for a motive for

41:00.846 --> 41:03.076
who killed your dad...

41:03.549 --> 41:07.451
I mean, if Simon elder knew
that it was Dutch who did that...

41:09.088 --> 41:11.556
- What?
- Isn't that Darling Plaza?

41:12.424 --> 41:13.914
God.

41:14.093 --> 41:18.029
That's the third time I've seen it today.
It doesn't get any easier.

41:18.097 --> 41:20.861
Darling Plaza was
demolished today as part of billionaire

41:20.933 --> 41:24.699
Simon elder's redevelopment plan
for a new, greener Manhattan.

41:24.803 --> 41:27.533
According to the demolition team,
the 15-story building...

41:27.606 --> 41:32.771
There is nothing that
that man is not capable of doing.

41:37.983 --> 41:39.814
I was hoping it'd be you.

41:39.885 --> 41:41.045
Hi.

41:41.620 --> 41:43.087
Happy Thanksgiving.

41:44.089 --> 41:45.613
Such as it is.

41:46.659 --> 41:47.785
I'm sorry I left, Nick,

41:47.860 --> 41:51.387
but sometimes, it is really hard
to deal with this whole situation.

41:51.463 --> 41:52.430
Well, I'll quit.

41:52.531 --> 41:54.294
Why don't I quit?

41:54.400 --> 41:55.765
I don't want you to quit.

41:56.268 --> 41:57.758
But I feel like you're slipping away,

41:57.836 --> 42:02.136
like things are just spiraling
out of control for both of us.

42:02.608 --> 42:04.371
Why don't I drive up there right now?

42:04.443 --> 42:05.410
No.

42:06.111 --> 42:07.476
We're just about to sit down and eat.

42:07.579 --> 42:10.742
Just take the night. Relax.
We'll still be here tomorrow.

42:11.483 --> 42:14.611
All right. I'll drive up in the morning.

42:17.523 --> 42:19.252
I love you, Nick.

42:20.259 --> 42:24.821
And I'm really... I'm trying.
You know that, right?

42:26.198 --> 42:29.690
Yeah, I know. I'm trying, too, Lise.

42:30.536 --> 42:32.163
We'll get through this.

42:33.372 --> 42:34.669
I know we will.

42:36.742 --> 42:39.609
All right. I love you.

42:39.657 --> 42:40.881
I love you, too.
