[narrator] <i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:

00:09.718 --> 00:12.721
Ladies, gentlemen.
Been months in the making, but we're here.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.264
Welcome to the new Southside.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.307
You asking me to join the Serpents?

00:16.391 --> 00:18.685
I wondered how you felt
about being my queen.

00:19.144 --> 00:22.230
I'll sell the Whyte Wyrm to you,
for Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.

00:22.605 --> 00:23.857
[Betty] <i>No more evil.</i>

00:24.524 --> 00:26.359
<i>You have no power over me.</i>

00:27.569 --> 00:30.530
I have someone who can help you, Mom,
from the Farm.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.491
Needs a lot of work, Dad.
But I'm up for it if you are.

00:33.575 --> 00:36.161
[Weatherbee] <i>And your new student</i>
<i>body president, Archie Andrews.</i>

00:36.244 --> 00:37.454
[all cheering]

00:37.579 --> 00:40.623
You got Andre to kill that boy
at Shadow Lake, Cassidy.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.334
When I do prove this,
I'll just come for you.

00:43.418 --> 00:47.088
[Hiram] <i>Steps have been taken to dissolve</i>

00:47.172 --> 00:48.506
<i>Sheriff, what are you doing?</i>

00:48.590 --> 00:52.177
You're under arrest for the murder
of Shadow Lake resident Cassidy Bullock.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.141
[Jughead] <i>It's the calm before the storm.</i>

00:58.516 --> 01:01.102
<i>The summer before your junior year</i>
<i>in high school.</i>

01:01.811 --> 01:03.021
<i>And how do you spend it?</i>

01:03.313 --> 01:05.148
<i>Working some brutal summer job</i>

01:05.231 --> 01:08.234
<i>that actually makes you look forward</i>
<i>to going back to school.</i>

01:10.653 --> 01:13.323
<i>Or maybe you have an internship</i>
<i>that doesn't pay much.</i>

01:13.948 --> 01:16.785
<i>That's okay,</i>
<i>because it's for a good cause.</i>

01:16.868 --> 01:19.037
-[woman] Focus on that.
-[Mary] No, no. See what I mean?

01:19.954 --> 01:22.999
[Jughead] <i>Or... maybe you spent it</i>
<i>at Sweetwater Swimming Hole.</i>

01:24.209 --> 01:27.337
<i>You... and the best friends</i>
<i>you'll ever have.</i>

01:29.881 --> 01:33.885
<i>Or maybe you spent most of June,</i>
<i>July, August in a courtroom,</i>

01:34.719 --> 01:37.013
<i>supporting our pal, Archie Andrews,</i>

01:37.097 --> 01:39.432
<i>who was on trial</i>
<i>for a murder he didn't commit,</i>

01:39.516 --> 01:42.060
<i>despite the DA's closing arguments.</i>

01:42.143 --> 01:44.270
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

01:44.354 --> 01:45.855
the evidence and testimony

01:45.939 --> 01:49.442
that was presented
in this court tell a dark story.

01:49.984 --> 01:53.113
That Mr. Andrews has a history
of violent behavior.

01:53.196 --> 01:56.699
That he started not one,
but two masked vigilante groups.

01:57.867 --> 02:00.662
That he assaulted an innocent boy,

02:00.745 --> 02:02.664
who was helpless with two broken legs.

02:04.332 --> 02:06.709
That he went wilding
in the Southside of town,

02:06.793 --> 02:09.379
and threatened to shoot a young man
in the face.

02:10.088 --> 02:13.716
That while partying with his friends
in the town of Shadow Lake,

02:13.800 --> 02:15.885
Mr. Andrews ran into the woods

02:15.969 --> 02:19.139
and shot the victim, Cassidy Bullock,
point-blank in the head.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.100
Now, Mr. Andrews claims

02:22.183 --> 02:26.020
that it was his girlfriend's father's
doorman who shot Mr. Bullock.

02:26.104 --> 02:30.108
A shot Mr. Andrews claims
to have heard, but not seen.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.026
[gunshot]

02:32.318 --> 02:34.362
Who knows the truth of what happened

02:34.445 --> 02:37.073
that terrible night
in the woods near Shadow Lake?

02:37.574 --> 02:38.575
I'll tell you who.

02:39.492 --> 02:40.368
That man.

02:41.286 --> 02:44.080
Archie Andrews may be a varsity athlete,

02:44.164 --> 02:46.040
and he may be a sensitive musician...

02:47.709 --> 02:48.835
but he is also...

02:50.128 --> 02:53.590
a cold-blooded killer.

03:02.348 --> 03:05.351
Ladies and gentlemen, we know for a fact

03:05.435 --> 03:10.148
that Archie Andrews constantly puts
the needs of others ahead of his own.

03:10.982 --> 03:14.527
We know that he helped
to solve the murder of Jason Blossom.

03:14.611 --> 03:18.573
We know that he offered both friends
and enemies shelter

03:18.656 --> 03:20.408
<i>when they had nowhere else to stay.</i>

03:21.034 --> 03:23.953
We know that he punched
through a river of ice

03:24.037 --> 03:26.581
<i>to save the life</i>
<i>of his classmate Cheryl Blossom.</i>

03:27.165 --> 03:32.003
Well, let me remind you that there
were no witnesses to the actual killing.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.006
There was no murder weapon.
There is no motive.

03:35.673 --> 03:37.926
At the end of the day,
all the prosecution has

03:38.009 --> 03:41.471
is cloudy testimony
from unreliable people.

03:42.055 --> 03:46.059
Now, it is my solemn duty,
as a mother, to protect my son.

03:46.142 --> 03:51.564
But as an attorney,
it's my duty to adhere to the facts,

03:52.273 --> 03:53.233
to the evidence.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.151
There is nothing here that proves

03:55.235 --> 03:59.906
that Archie Andrews is anything less
than an innocent boy.

04:01.991 --> 04:02.992
Thank you. Thanks, Mom.

04:10.291 --> 04:13.878
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
the charge is first-degree murder.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.839
You may retire
to begin your deliberations.

04:19.968 --> 04:20.969

04:27.267 --> 04:29.185
Okay, can you just level with us, Mom?

04:29.602 --> 04:31.562
What do you think Archie's chances are?

04:31.813 --> 04:34.315
Baby, I'd say fifty-fifty.

04:34.899 --> 04:37.193
If you had to come down
on a side, Mrs. McCoy?

04:37.277 --> 04:39.696
-You were great in there, Mary.
-Thank you, Fred.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.115
It's only the most important case
of our lives.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.908
You were amazing, Mrs. Andrews.

04:44.492 --> 04:47.120
Well, Betty,
your help this summer was a godsend.

04:47.203 --> 04:49.122

-Have you guys seen Archie?

05:18.067 --> 05:19.027
Yeah, good, Jug.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.071
What were you thinking about just now?

05:22.238 --> 05:24.991
How you're gonna walk out
of this courthouse a free man?

05:25.533 --> 05:26.534
No, I...

05:28.369 --> 05:29.537
There was this place...

05:30.538 --> 05:33.041
we've never been before, Ronnie,
but Betty and Jug,

05:33.124 --> 05:34.959
remember Sweetwater Swimming Hole?

05:35.043 --> 05:38.046
-We went every summer.
-I was just thinking about that place.

05:38.129 --> 05:40.673
Yeah, me too. What made us stop going? Oh.
Probably when we got covered in leeches.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.220
Was that us, or was that a movie?

05:46.304 --> 05:47.889
-Definitely us.
-[Jughead] That was us.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.183
I'd like to go.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.311
-Hopefully you can take me, Archie?
-Hopefully.

05:53.936 --> 05:54.896
[Kevin] Guys.

05:54.979 --> 05:57.857

06:00.860 --> 06:02.820

06:05.573 --> 06:07.033
But I've dismissed them.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.535
They're sequestered,
and I've instructed them

06:09.619 --> 06:13.706
not to read anything about this case,
nor to discuss it with anyone.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.667
We'll reconvene Tuesday morning,
after Labor Day.

06:20.296 --> 06:21.756
My advice to you, young man,

06:22.507 --> 06:26.844
is to spend this weekend with your family
and your loved ones.

06:29.764 --> 06:30.598
That's all.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.976
This just buys us more time
to figure out what we need next.

06:36.604 --> 06:37.438
Hey, Archie.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.360
-Have a terrific weekend.
-[Mary] Fred!

06:42.902 --> 06:44.195
-[Archie] Dad, stop.
-No, no.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.738
Guys, guys. Come on.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.740

-Shut up, Doiley.

If we could only find the gun
that Andre used to kill Cassidy.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.971
[Veronica] I've torn The Pembrooke apart.

07:10.054 --> 07:13.266
After the riots, my father wiped any
and all traces of Andre.

07:13.349 --> 07:15.268
He wouldn't have brought it back
from Shadow Lake.

07:15.351 --> 07:18.938
-That's probably where he ditched it.
-So, we go back to Shadow Woods?

07:19.021 --> 07:22.442
-We've looked.
-Let's look again. With metal detectors.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.777
If we get Andre's gun,
we can plant it on--

07:24.861 --> 07:25.862
-No.
-[Archie] No.

07:26.279 --> 07:29.490
I don't wanna do that,
spend what could be my last weekend

07:29.574 --> 07:32.618
looking for evidence that isn't there,
planting it who-knows-where.

07:32.702 --> 07:36.247
Archie, we have three extra days
to prove that you're innocent.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.793
-What would you have us do, Archie?
-What the judge said.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.670
After the worst summer ever,

07:42.753 --> 07:45.882
I want us to have a great,
normal Labor Day weekend.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.926
Can we do that?

07:50.136 --> 07:52.430

12:11.689 --> 12:13.691
If you see them, don't engage with them.

12:13.774 --> 12:16.944
This is just a recon mission.
Can't be risking another gang war.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.822
I just need confirmation
that what Hiram's up to

12:19.905 --> 12:22.158
has nothing to do with the Serpents
or Riverdale High.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.452
Will do. You got it.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.413

12:27.496 --> 12:29.749
[chuckles] Might be my best one yet.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.042
How's it feel to be an honorary Serpent?

12:32.126 --> 12:33.461
Feels pretty savage, Jug.

12:35.796 --> 12:38.340
Archie, the first thing I learned
at Southside High

12:38.424 --> 12:40.926
was that you need to roll with a crew
to survive.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.137
There'll be Serpents
in juvenile detention.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.139
Find them. Sit with them.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.515

12:52.354 --> 12:54.482

12:54.857 --> 12:57.443

about protecting this, eh?

12:57.860 --> 12:59.069
I speak from experience.

12:59.153 --> 13:02.406
Your mind is the first thing
that goes when you're locked up.

13:02.490 --> 13:06.076
But if you can keep your head on straight,
you can get through anything.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.453
You just...

13:09.914 --> 13:11.791

13:25.554 --> 13:27.807
I was telling Edgar about them,
and he feels,

13:27.890 --> 13:30.309
and I agree, you should burn them.

13:30.392 --> 13:32.478

and suffering over the years.

You need to let that go.

Okay, Dr. Glass says
journaling is a perfectly healthy outlet.

13:42.905 --> 13:46.992

Betty, but these diaries are your past.

We know that you look down
on the Farm, Betty.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.259
But Edgar has done nothing but help me.

14:03.342 --> 14:07.221
He's encouraged me to embrace everything
that I was ashamed of,

14:07.596 --> 14:09.932
-and become the best version of myself.
-Mom,

14:10.015 --> 14:12.059
-I can't deal with this right now.
-But--

14:12.518 --> 14:15.396

You're not dealing with it.

You're running around a mile a minute,
and you need to be sitting still.

what your soul is telling you.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.203
Okay, I'm listening to my soul.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.621
And what it's saying is:

14:32.705 --> 14:36.000
"Get the hell away from your mother.
She's been body-snatched."

you should know about Betty, Mom.
