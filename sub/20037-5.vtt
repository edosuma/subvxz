00:01.340 --> 00:03.780
I have a story
of a shameless whore

00:03.780 --> 00:07.580
whom I once saw cavorting
with her cull in plain sight.

00:07.580 --> 00:09.660
What was your name
in those days?

00:09.660 --> 00:11.420
You've stood by all this time

00:11.420 --> 00:13.020
while your Mumma torments me.

00:13.020 --> 00:14.260
Take a message to Mrs. Wells.

00:14.260 --> 00:15.740
Tell her I want to come back.

00:15.740 --> 00:17.860
I'll smile and smile
and bring in new custom.

00:17.860 --> 00:20.700
The Spartans would
like a sacrifice.

00:20.700 --> 00:23.180
One girl, one name.

00:23.180 --> 00:24.380
That's Lord Fallon.

00:24.380 --> 00:27.380
I'll take you to my
underworld one day.

00:27.380 --> 00:29.060
Get off, you're disgusting!

00:29.060 --> 00:31.180
Well, your sister doesn't
seem to think so, do you?

00:31.180 --> 00:33.740
I am not yours to command!

01:47.300 --> 01:50.140
My man.

01:50.140 --> 01:52.860
You were majestic last night.

02:02.220 --> 02:04.780
We did it.

02:04.780 --> 02:06.700
We did.

02:13.460 --> 02:16.140
I haven't forgotten
about the French girl.

02:40.620 --> 02:43.140
No, Madam, you can't
Mrs. Margaret Wells

02:43.140 --> 02:45.020
to see Mrs. Lydia Quigley.

02:45.020 --> 02:46.740
Stay back.

02:46.740 --> 02:48.420
What is the meaning
of this intrusion?

02:48.420 --> 02:50.020
I come in peace.

02:50.020 --> 02:51.620
With your brute in tow?

02:51.620 --> 02:54.140
I've come to pay
MarieLouise's debt to you.

02:54.140 --> 02:55.540
I didn't poach her.

02:55.540 --> 02:57.020
She came to me.

03:00.620 --> 03:04.020
This makes us even
for Emily Lacey.

03:04.020 --> 03:05.420
It'd be better for business

03:05.420 --> 03:08.420
if we called a truce
on our recent skirmishes.

03:08.420 --> 03:10.300
You overreach yourself.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.140
You underestimate me.

03:12.140 --> 03:14.860
You always have.

03:14.860 --> 03:16.420
You're still the halfpenny drab

03:16.420 --> 03:18.020
I picked out of the gutter.

03:18.020 --> 03:20.980
The same halfpenny drab
that now runs a fine house,

03:20.980 --> 03:22.420
with the means to come at you.

03:22.420 --> 03:24.540
I'm quaking with fear!

03:24.540 --> 03:26.820
I know what you are.

03:26.820 --> 03:28.900
MarieLouise tells me

03:28.900 --> 03:31.820
that you still keep
your girls locked in.

03:31.820 --> 03:35.740
Sounds an awful lot like kidnap.

03:35.740 --> 03:37.140
You dare!

03:37.140 --> 03:39.460
You dare play that
vengeful trick on me again

03:39.460 --> 03:41.260
and I will raze your
house to the ground

03:41.260 --> 03:43.460
with you and all
your vile spawn in it.

03:43.460 --> 03:46.740
Do you accept our truce?

03:46.740 --> 03:50.380
I should have turned
your putrid mother away.

03:50.380 --> 03:54.460
You'd have died in that
gutter within a week.

03:54.460 --> 03:56.700
Thank you for all your charity.

04:08.300 --> 04:10.860
Mrs. Wells!

04:10.860 --> 04:12.420
Mrs. Wells!

04:16.500 --> 04:18.260
Mrs. Wells, is it?

04:18.260 --> 04:19.740
You bitch!

04:19.740 --> 04:22.740
You ungrateful,
thankless little.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.020
Mumma, please stop it!

04:24.020 --> 04:25.180
I took you in,

04:25.180 --> 04:26.380
I looked after you,

04:26.380 --> 04:28.260
and you betrayed me!

04:28.260 --> 04:30.060
Charles!

04:30.060 --> 04:32.420
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry,

04:32.420 --> 04:34.940
I'm soCharles, please!

04:40.860 --> 04:42.020
Mrs. Wells!

04:42.020 --> 04:45.420
Fallon, this cannot start.
Mrs. Wells?

04:45.420 --> 04:47.620
Lord Fallon...

04:47.620 --> 04:48.500
sir.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.060
May I compliment you

04:50.060 --> 04:53.180
on the superbly filthy
revels of last night.

04:53.180 --> 04:57.260
Our odyssey has been
a blur of delights.

04:57.260 --> 05:00.380
But your young
daughter stands out.

05:00.380 --> 05:01.740
I'd like to meet her.

05:11.620 --> 05:13.740
I'm here to see Charlotte.

05:22.180 --> 05:24.500
 Enter.

05:28.860 --> 05:30.740
Lucy.

05:30.740 --> 05:32.620
What a startling joy.

05:32.620 --> 05:34.740
I came to see Charlotte.

05:34.740 --> 05:36.420
She's deserted me,

05:36.420 --> 05:39.260
yet again.

05:39.260 --> 05:41.500
You'll have to...

05:41.500 --> 05:43.820
keep me company.

05:43.820 --> 05:45.820
I paid my debt to you.

05:45.820 --> 05:48.580
And wasn't it exhilarating?

05:48.580 --> 05:51.500
There's no shame in
coming back for more.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.420
Perhaps I could keep
both you and Charlotte.

05:54.420 --> 05:58.820
What a cozy threesome we'd make.

06:04.740 --> 06:08.020
I strive for achievements
in life, Haxby.

06:08.020 --> 06:11.020
Bedding both Wells sisters
has been one of my finest.

06:12.260 --> 06:14.060
My wife's sister.

06:14.060 --> 06:17.740
Look at that.

06:24.940 --> 06:26.580
Charlotte Wells!

06:26.580 --> 06:28.260
Sir Christopher.

06:28.260 --> 06:29.820
What a delightful surprise.

06:29.820 --> 06:31.940
The delight's
all mine, Miss Wells.

06:31.940 --> 06:34.260
You are always
a treat for the senses.

06:34.260 --> 06:37.060
What a fine figure
you make on your horse.

06:37.060 --> 06:38.820
Sir George is
stewing in his pit,

06:38.820 --> 06:40.820
reeking like a still.

06:40.820 --> 06:42.620
I simply had to take some air.

06:42.620 --> 06:44.380
I find there's nothing
better than a good ride

06:44.380 --> 06:46.180
to see off the effects of drink.

06:46.180 --> 06:48.500
We still talking about horses?

06:59.420 --> 07:02.620
Mrs. Quigley is making you ill.

07:02.620 --> 07:05.580
This house is not worth it.

07:05.580 --> 07:08.380
We have to leave.
We must stay.

07:08.380 --> 07:12.180
I do not understand
her hold over you.

07:12.180 --> 07:15.180
She has been sent into
our lives for a purpose.

07:15.180 --> 07:18.060
But we risk being
corrupted by her.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.020
Not thee,

07:22.020 --> 07:24.060
my dear, pure girl.

07:26.260 --> 07:28.300
It is a trial.

07:28.300 --> 07:31.740
It is not for us to understand.

07:31.740 --> 07:33.580
It is God's will.

07:33.580 --> 07:36.140
But you are not strong enough.

07:36.140 --> 07:40.260
Then you must be strong
enough for both of us.

07:40.260 --> 07:44.020
Go out amongst the harlots.

07:44.020 --> 07:47.740
Tell them no penitence
is ever enough.

07:47.740 --> 07:49.820
For once they
besmirch themselves,

07:49.820 --> 07:53.620
the stench will follow them
their whole lives through.

08:03.260 --> 08:06.260
We could do with
a night off, couldn't we?

08:06.260 --> 08:08.180
My cunny's dry as chalk.

08:08.180 --> 08:10.740
A bit of butter will
sort that out, Fanny.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.500
We're open as usual,

08:12.500 --> 08:14.500
so don't suffer.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.060
Yes!

08:21.140 --> 08:23.180
Here's a guinea for last night.

08:23.180 --> 08:25.820
Guinea for each of you.

08:25.820 --> 08:28.060
It's a taste of things to come,

08:28.060 --> 08:30.060
if we all work hard.

08:30.060 --> 08:32.020
Thank you, Mrs. Wells.

08:32.020 --> 08:34.860
Thank you, Mrs. Wells.

08:34.860 --> 08:36.659
And my guinea?

08:36.659 --> 08:38.539
I paid your debt this morning.

08:38.539 --> 08:40.460
You'll get yours
next time round.

08:40.460 --> 08:43.140
You're lucky to have me.

08:43.140 --> 08:45.340
I like your front, Mademoiselle.

08:45.340 --> 08:47.620
Keep that up,
culls will love it.

08:47.620 --> 08:50.220
Fanny, show her to your room.

08:55.380 --> 08:57.140
Here she is,

08:57.140 --> 08:58.740
the girl of the hour.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.500
One of the finest
gentlemen in London

09:04.500 --> 09:06.140
wants to meet you
this afternoon.

09:06.140 --> 09:08.100
Who?

09:08.100 --> 09:10.020
Lord Fallon.

09:10.020 --> 09:12.620
Lord, with his
twenty thousand a year

09:12.620 --> 09:14.740
and all his grand houses.

09:14.740 --> 09:16.380
You could get him
for your keeper.

09:16.380 --> 09:17.740
Hmph.

09:17.740 --> 09:19.500
Lucy.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.660
You'll be set up in fine style.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.260
Just like Charlotte.

09:23.260 --> 09:26.140
Your own Sir George.

09:26.140 --> 09:28.340
A Lord Babington is here,

09:28.340 --> 09:32.140
looking for an early rising.

09:32.140 --> 09:33.620
Harriet?

09:33.620 --> 09:36.660
Are you up to this?

09:36.660 --> 09:37.980
Yes.

09:37.980 --> 09:40.140
Charge him four guineas,
see if he blinks.

09:41.380 --> 09:43.100
And get a message to Repton

09:43.100 --> 09:44.380
to come and fetch his goat,

09:44.380 --> 09:47.020
otherwise it's ending up
in the pot for supper.

10:04.620 --> 10:06.900
Probably not what
you're used to, but...

10:06.900 --> 10:09.260
it's snug.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.140
No lock?

10:11.140 --> 10:12.540
What for?

10:16.020 --> 10:19.140
What will you do
when the baby comes?

10:19.140 --> 10:21.380
No, I'm I'm not that way,

10:21.380 --> 10:24.340
I'm just big, that's all.

10:24.340 --> 10:26.860
I like my buns
do you want some?

10:32.140 --> 10:36.100
You won't say about that
to anyone else, will you?

10:36.100 --> 10:37.500
About what?

10:47.860 --> 10:49.740
My dear girl.

10:49.740 --> 10:51.620
Let me go!

10:51.620 --> 10:54.460
She'll kill me.

10:54.460 --> 10:56.780
I'm going to look after you.

10:56.780 --> 10:58.540
Besides,

10:58.540 --> 11:01.260
she'll kill me if I let you go.

11:01.260 --> 11:02.980
Look at what she did to me,

11:02.980 --> 11:04.460
her own son.

11:04.460 --> 11:07.620
What she did to you?

11:07.620 --> 11:09.740
My little chicken.

11:09.740 --> 11:11.140
Don't fear.

11:11.140 --> 11:13.660
I'm going to put her
in the coal cellar.

11:13.660 --> 11:15.140
We'll be king and queen,

11:15.140 --> 11:16.860
and you'll never have
to bed anyone else

11:16.860 --> 11:18.140
ever again...

11:18.140 --> 11:19.500
apart from me.

11:19.500 --> 11:21.020
You're drunk.

11:21.020 --> 11:22.660
No.

11:22.660 --> 11:27.260
I've just had a little
sup of Lady Laudanum.

11:27.260 --> 11:28.660
For my pain.

11:28.660 --> 11:31.020
Herehave some.

11:33.020 --> 11:34.460
Let me.

11:37.260 --> 11:38.980
Not too much.

11:42.740 --> 11:46.380
Did she hurt you very much?

11:46.380 --> 11:48.660
To the core of my soul.

12:14.020 --> 12:15.980
No.

12:35.860 --> 12:37.860
Hello?

13:03.380 --> 13:05.260
Quigley?

14:04.020 --> 14:07.020
You paid the French girl's debt.

14:07.020 --> 14:10.100
Pay mine to Benjamin
and get me my children,

14:10.100 --> 14:12.140
and I'll work for you
for the rest of my life,

14:12.140 --> 14:13.500
if needs be.

14:16.660 --> 14:19.260
I was tipped this
by Lord Babington.

14:19.260 --> 14:23.780
Two guineas, on top
of what you charged.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.660
I'm valuable to you.

14:26.660 --> 14:28.740
Very well.

14:28.740 --> 14:31.380
We'll talk to him.

14:31.380 --> 14:32.900
Thank you.

14:39.260 --> 14:41.020
Charlotte Wells.

14:41.020 --> 14:46.260
You are a forward,
flaunting hussy.

14:47.860 --> 14:49.260
Be mine.

14:49.260 --> 14:52.020
Should we retire
to your apartment

14:52.020 --> 14:53.740
to discuss terms?

14:53.740 --> 14:58.020
Wife's in town,
one of her dinners.

14:58.020 --> 15:01.620
But this is perfect.

15:01.620 --> 15:03.860
I can be the farmer,

15:03.860 --> 15:06.540
you the milkmaid...

15:06.540 --> 15:11.500
panting for congress
in the open air.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.260
Here.

15:16.260 --> 15:18.140
Take this.

15:18.140 --> 15:20.620
There's a shady bower
I know down by the water.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.620
You insult me, sir.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.020
I'm not some low street girl

15:25.020 --> 15:28.100
that can be bought for
a quick upright in the bushes.

15:28.100 --> 15:31.100
I'm the best time of your life.

15:31.100 --> 15:35.460
Morning, noon, and night.

15:37.740 --> 15:39.900
You want me as your keeper?

15:39.900 --> 15:42.500
We would have a riotous time.

15:44.500 --> 15:48.860
I like the occasional
dalliance, but...

15:48.860 --> 15:52.220
a kept mistress.

15:52.220 --> 15:54.540
My wife would
chop off my manhood.

15:57.620 --> 15:59.260
What's left of it.

16:01.620 --> 16:03.460
Let me in!
All right, all right,

16:03.460 --> 16:04.500
I'm coming.

16:04.500 --> 16:05.740
Let me in!

16:05.740 --> 16:06.860
Emily!

16:06.860 --> 16:08.380
Mrs. Wells!
What's happened to you?

16:08.380 --> 16:10.460
Where is she?

16:10.460 --> 16:12.980
Mrs. Wells, thank god!

16:15.020 --> 16:16.380
Sweet Jesus.

16:16.380 --> 16:18.100
God, I made such a mistake.

16:18.100 --> 16:19.220
Can you take me back?

16:19.220 --> 16:20.860
I beg you, I'll do
anything you want,

16:20.860 --> 16:23.460
anything.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.660
You're Quigley's girl now.

16:25.660 --> 16:27.260
Who do you think did this?

16:27.260 --> 16:28.980
You made your choice, Emily.

16:28.980 --> 16:31.860
We can't turn her away.
She made her choice.

16:31.860 --> 16:34.340
No, please, please,
just help me, please.

16:36.740 --> 16:38.140
You.

16:38.140 --> 16:41.620
You snake, you were
meant to help me!

16:41.620 --> 16:42.780
Here.

16:42.780 --> 16:44.900
Take this to get you
through the night.

16:44.900 --> 16:46.740
Keep your wits about you,

16:46.740 --> 16:48.740
try and stay off the street.

16:52.340 --> 16:55.620
Curse this house

16:55.620 --> 16:57.660
and every stinking one of you.

16:57.660 --> 16:59.020
 Hey.

16:59.020 --> 17:00.260
Get off!

17:07.020 --> 17:09.740
I will protect you while
you're under my roof.

17:09.740 --> 17:12.260
But I will not be
played for a fool.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.420
Come on.

17:20.420 --> 17:22.260
Let's get to work.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.180
Hello, Bill.

17:39.180 --> 17:41.020
She let you off your leash?

17:41.020 --> 17:43.900
Who gave you such
a pasting, girl?

17:43.900 --> 17:45.500
Who cares?

17:45.500 --> 17:47.740
No one cares.

17:47.740 --> 17:50.740
The dog shouldn't go unpunished.

17:50.740 --> 17:52.500
The dog's a bitch.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.020
There's a room at mine,

17:57.020 --> 17:59.020
if you want it.

17:59.020 --> 18:00.460
You can rest up, pay me back

18:00.460 --> 18:02.340
when you're fit and well.

18:02.340 --> 18:05.340
I've got money.

18:05.340 --> 18:08.260
I don't need your pity,

18:08.260 --> 18:10.060
you rancid troll.

18:12.580 --> 18:16.260
I've been at Quigley's.

18:16.260 --> 18:18.740
I'll find an even better house.

18:30.260 --> 18:34.580
How lovely of you to call!

18:34.580 --> 18:37.540
I've been on the
prowl for rich men.

18:37.540 --> 18:39.300
It's tiring work.

18:41.100 --> 18:43.700
So.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.740
There.

18:45.740 --> 18:48.100
Aren't we a snug party?

18:48.100 --> 18:50.740
Just like old times.

18:50.740 --> 18:53.500
I miss my Carlotta.

18:55.660 --> 18:58.700
Did you quarrel with Sir Fopwit?

18:58.700 --> 19:01.260
He was very taken
with Lucy last night.

19:01.260 --> 19:02.780
As was everyone.

19:02.780 --> 19:06.500
Do you mind her stealing
all the attention?

19:06.500 --> 19:09.500
Do you mind that you
gave her up so soon?

19:09.500 --> 19:12.260
He has a new "niece"
to occupy him.

19:15.820 --> 19:18.500
But what of you?

19:18.500 --> 19:21.740
I tire of Sir George.

19:21.740 --> 19:25.020
I thought you might know of
someone seeking a companion.

19:25.020 --> 19:26.340
Good news.

19:26.340 --> 19:29.180
He's a vain fizzle of a man.

19:29.180 --> 19:33.740
We onlookers long to see you
sparring with a true match.

19:38.460 --> 19:40.740
And this is your young nephew.

19:40.740 --> 19:42.580
He's whatever I want him to be,

19:42.580 --> 19:44.300
whenever I want it.

19:47.300 --> 19:50.540
Would you like to stroke him?

19:50.540 --> 19:52.020
He's not a pet.

19:52.020 --> 19:54.740
But he is.

19:56.220 --> 20:00.020
I can't help with
your dilemma, I'm afraid.

20:00.020 --> 20:02.020
Lovely as you are,

20:02.020 --> 20:05.020
you're too old
for my tastes now.

20:05.020 --> 20:06.500
She's still Charlotte Wells.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.500
She can get a new
keeper in a trice.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.060
Yes.

20:10.060 --> 20:12.300
Why, surely there are
chaps who trail around

20:12.300 --> 20:14.300
just to catch a glimpse of you,

20:14.300 --> 20:18.420
in the coffee houses,
the pleasure gardens,

20:18.420 --> 20:20.460
The Cocoa Tree.

20:20.460 --> 20:23.820
Work your charms on one of them.

20:27.820 --> 20:29.740
The children belong
with their mother.

20:29.740 --> 20:31.180
Their mother works for me.

20:31.180 --> 20:33.740
If she's fretting, she's
not giving me her best.

20:33.740 --> 20:39.100
I came here for relief,
not a lecture from a bawd.

20:39.100 --> 20:42.060
Like a duck to water.

20:42.060 --> 20:44.500
I want to add the price
of Harriet's children

20:44.500 --> 20:46.460
to my debt to you,

20:46.460 --> 20:48.900
so that they may be
reunited with their mother.

20:48.900 --> 20:51.060
You cannot pay
what you already owe.

20:51.060 --> 20:53.580
There's been a change
in our fortunes.

20:53.580 --> 20:56.220
I'll start repaying
you next week.

20:56.220 --> 20:59.220
The price of my young
slaves has gone up.

20:59.220 --> 21:00.780
I want a hundred
pounds for them.

21:00.780 --> 21:01.980
You can't do that.

21:01.980 --> 21:03.260
They're your brother and sister.

21:03.260 --> 21:04.660
They're my property!

21:04.660 --> 21:06.660
You're not fit to be
a wart on your father's arse.

21:06.660 --> 21:08.420
Can I have my whore now?

21:08.420 --> 21:09.540
I'll lie with a corpse

21:09.540 --> 21:10.980
before I'll lie with you again.

21:10.980 --> 21:12.500
Benjamin, please.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.340
Breed with your
own sort in future.

21:15.340 --> 21:17.020
Save us all this ungodly mess.

21:17.020 --> 21:19.460
All right, that's enough,
get out, callous swine.

21:19.460 --> 21:22.020
I'll get a better class
of whore elsewhere.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.820
I regard it my duty to deal
with these type of people.

21:31.260 --> 21:33.260
Will you excuse me for a moment?

21:33.260 --> 21:34.740
Yes, sir.

21:37.740 --> 21:38.940
Where's the girl?

21:38.940 --> 21:40.260
It is no concern of yours.

21:40.260 --> 21:42.780
You will only be implicated
if you ask questions.

21:42.780 --> 21:44.060
I found blood.

21:44.060 --> 21:45.180
What have you done to her?

21:45.180 --> 21:46.540
Let it alone.

21:46.540 --> 21:48.500
I want to know who I'm
risking the noose for.

21:48.500 --> 21:49.820
I gave you Lord Fallon.

21:49.820 --> 21:51.060
A foot soldier.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.780
I want a real name,
the King of the Spartans.

21:52.780 --> 21:55.500
That's my surety, or I
will help you no more.

21:59.740 --> 22:02.260
Gentlemen.

22:11.300 --> 22:12.500
What news, Ma?

22:12.500 --> 22:14.220
We're the news,
or at least Lucy is.

22:14.220 --> 22:15.540
What are you doing here?

22:15.540 --> 22:18.500
A spot of hunting.

22:18.500 --> 22:21.260
You all right?

22:21.260 --> 22:22.660
Yeah.

22:22.660 --> 22:23.940
Are we.

22:23.940 --> 22:25.500
Course we are, sprat.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.580
Don't tell Ma.

22:30.580 --> 22:32.820
Nothing to tell.

22:35.260 --> 22:38.100
Lord Fallon, such an honor.

22:44.740 --> 22:46.500
Lord Fallon.

22:46.500 --> 22:49.900
As entreated, may I formally
present my youngest daughter,

22:49.900 --> 22:51.780
Lucy Wells.

22:51.780 --> 22:55.420
The songbird of the underworld.

22:55.420 --> 22:57.300
Enchanted.

22:59.900 --> 23:02.220
Lord Fallon's a real
prospect for Lucy.

23:02.220 --> 23:04.100
I need one too, Ma.

23:04.100 --> 23:06.540
I've got to get away
from Sir George.

23:06.540 --> 23:08.420
Can I come home for a while?

23:08.420 --> 23:09.780
Greek Street's not your home.

23:09.780 --> 23:11.580
You know my meaning,
with you and Lucy.

23:11.580 --> 23:13.340
What do you want to
hawk around Soho for,

23:13.340 --> 23:15.420
when you're living like
a duchess in St. James's?

23:15.420 --> 23:17.500
Is it wrong to want
to be with my family?

23:17.500 --> 23:19.540
You should be setting
your sights higher,

23:19.540 --> 23:21.180
not lower.

23:21.180 --> 23:24.260
Have I taught you nothing?

23:24.260 --> 23:26.740
Go and mind your favorite.

23:32.220 --> 23:35.460
You always make me
feel ten years younger.

23:38.020 --> 23:39.420
Where's Charles?

23:39.420 --> 23:43.180
He's been with Emily all day.

23:43.180 --> 23:45.220
I managed the house for you.

23:47.020 --> 23:49.500
Are you in there
with that trollop?

23:51.420 --> 23:55.060
Drunk again.

24:00.780 --> 24:03.100
Charles!

24:03.100 --> 24:04.780
Charles, speak to me!

24:04.780 --> 24:06.780
Charles, speak to me, please.

24:06.780 --> 24:09.060
Speak to your mother.

24:09.060 --> 24:10.100
Help!

24:10.100 --> 24:12.060
Help, we need help now!

24:19.060 --> 24:22.220
The good Lord will
always forgive you.

24:22.220 --> 24:25.180
He will welcome with open arms

24:25.180 --> 24:27.580
those who have strayed
Scanwell!

24:30.500 --> 24:32.940
Wait here, I'll be back.

24:32.940 --> 24:35.220
Amelia. Miss Cross.

24:37.300 --> 24:38.940
How's your ma?

24:38.940 --> 24:41.940
A little better, thank you.

24:41.940 --> 24:44.300
Why'd you run off last night?

24:47.220 --> 24:49.220
Oi, come on, Violet!

24:49.220 --> 24:52.300
If it's money you need...

24:52.300 --> 24:54.020
I have it.

24:57.540 --> 24:59.500
You are prettier than him.

25:10.020 --> 25:11.740
House to roll.

25:15.540 --> 25:17.420
And house wins, sir.

25:19.820 --> 25:21.740
The lady wins again.

25:23.780 --> 25:25.940
No, he's too old.

25:25.940 --> 25:29.300
His twig and berries'll
be shriveled out of sight.

25:29.300 --> 25:31.700
Play again, sir?

25:31.700 --> 25:34.460
Lady Repton let you
off your leash?

25:34.460 --> 25:35.820
Slipped it.

25:35.820 --> 25:38.540
She's got the stamina
of a ploughman.

25:38.540 --> 25:40.100
I'm wrung out.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.100
Poor Mr. Marney.

25:42.100 --> 25:44.260
What will become of you?

25:44.260 --> 25:47.100
I thought I might try
my chances in America.

25:47.100 --> 25:49.020
Hop a ride over the ocean.

25:49.020 --> 25:52.220
You're missing your
friends, the fish?

25:52.220 --> 25:55.660
There's lots I miss
about the ocean.

25:55.660 --> 25:58.020
Wide horizons,

25:58.020 --> 26:01.300
sense of possibility.

26:01.300 --> 26:05.020
Care to join me?

26:05.020 --> 26:06.580
Why not?

26:06.580 --> 26:10.420
We can keep ourselves,
be our own masters.

26:19.020 --> 26:22.220
So when do you propose we
set off on this adventure?

26:22.220 --> 26:24.340
Why, this very day.

26:24.340 --> 26:26.300
Let's go down to the docks
and see what's about.

26:26.300 --> 26:29.020
And supposing we
survive the crossing.

26:29.020 --> 26:31.820
What would we do in America?
What wouldn't we do?

26:31.820 --> 26:33.260
We could start again,

26:33.260 --> 26:36.180
we'd be Lord and Lady
Lovewealth on the rampage!

26:38.780 --> 26:40.100
I'm serious.

26:41.900 --> 26:43.540
Let's do it.

26:45.940 --> 26:48.540
I'll get seasick.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.020
But you're right.

26:50.020 --> 26:52.740
We should be our own masters.

26:59.820 --> 27:00.980
Charles!

27:00.980 --> 27:02.940
This is a powerful emetic.

27:02.940 --> 27:05.660
It will discharge the
poisons from his body.

27:05.660 --> 27:07.820
Good boy.

27:07.820 --> 27:11.260
Good boy, good boy.

27:11.260 --> 27:14.260
Clean itclean it!

27:15.900 --> 27:19.020
Help me get him to his feet.

27:19.020 --> 27:20.260
Help.

27:20.260 --> 27:22.100
We must keep him
conscious, madam,

27:22.100 --> 27:23.980
or the drug will take him.

27:23.980 --> 27:26.260
Walk with Mumma round and round.

27:26.260 --> 27:28.260
Round the park like we used to.

27:28.260 --> 27:29.700
That's a good boy.

27:31.180 --> 27:32.740
Don't torment me, Betsey.

27:32.740 --> 27:34.420
Please?

27:34.420 --> 27:37.060
Why so cold, Bobby?

27:37.060 --> 27:40.060
We only want a little
drink, we're thirsty.

27:40.060 --> 27:41.980
You must be good, Bets,
he's having a spasm

27:41.980 --> 27:43.740
every time you touch him.

27:43.740 --> 27:46.020
I gave you all my money.

27:46.020 --> 27:47.940
Aww, poor Bobby.

27:50.340 --> 27:52.740
I'm toying with
a conundrum, lady:

27:52.740 --> 27:54.260
Whether to tell your harlot

27:54.260 --> 27:56.540
you're in the pay
of Madame Quigley,

27:56.540 --> 27:58.340
or to tell your mother
you're in the sway

27:58.340 --> 28:00.180
of a harlot.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.260
Fear not.

28:04.260 --> 28:06.660
I'll say nothing at all.

28:06.660 --> 28:08.300
Oi!

28:08.300 --> 28:11.300
Leave her be, you runt.

28:11.300 --> 28:12.500
Is he bothering you?

28:12.500 --> 28:15.900
No, no.

28:15.900 --> 28:20.500
I wish to thank him
for helping my mother...

28:20.500 --> 28:22.180
and me.

28:22.180 --> 28:23.500
Move on.

28:23.500 --> 28:25.580
Don't pretend you're a friend.

28:40.020 --> 28:44.780
Split me, weren't you
Emily Lacey once?

28:44.780 --> 28:47.340
I still fucking am!

29:03.460 --> 29:06.220
We must pray he rallies now.

29:25.060 --> 29:26.180
Child...

29:30.500 --> 29:32.340
Mother!

29:32.340 --> 29:35.740
Where have you been for so long?

29:35.740 --> 29:37.500
You are not safe
among the harlots.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.660
But you sent me to them.

29:38.660 --> 29:39.940
I was wrong.

29:39.940 --> 29:42.180
They will exploit your
compassion and corrupt you.

29:42.180 --> 29:44.180
Shh, do not fret so.

29:44.180 --> 29:47.260
I am here, I am fine.

29:47.260 --> 29:49.300
Proverbs, there is
a passage in Proverbs,

29:49.300 --> 29:50.580
read it for me.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.900
Chapter five, verse three.

29:57.820 --> 30:01.220
Chapter five, verse three.

30:01.220 --> 30:04.060
"For the lips of a strange woman"

30:04.060 --> 30:06.500
drop as honeycomb,

30:06.500 --> 30:09.340
"and her mouth is
smoother than oil."

30:09.340 --> 30:10.780
See how they draw you in.

30:10.780 --> 30:14.100
"But her end is
bitter as wormwood,"

30:14.100 --> 30:16.700
sharp as a twoedged sword.

30:16.700 --> 30:19.020
Her feet go down to death.

30:19.020 --> 30:22.300
"Her steps take hold on hell."

30:22.300 --> 30:23.500
I'm burning.

30:23.500 --> 30:25.660
Amelia, I'm burning!

30:51.260 --> 30:53.820
I don't want your money.

30:53.820 --> 30:56.260
I want you.

31:08.300 --> 31:12.100
I did not admit you.

31:12.100 --> 31:14.420
These things are not yours!

31:14.420 --> 31:16.900
They are, paid
for by hard labor.

31:16.900 --> 31:19.900
Paid for by Lady Caroline.

31:19.900 --> 31:22.740
You think she would like this?

31:22.740 --> 31:24.780
You wait long enough,
she too might take pity

31:24.780 --> 31:26.420
and bestow her favors upon you.

31:26.420 --> 31:28.580
It is I who pitied you,

31:28.580 --> 31:30.460
though it revolts me
to think of it now.

31:30.460 --> 31:32.300
Prize your luck, Mr. Haxby.

31:32.300 --> 31:34.820
You had the famous
Charlotte Wells for free.

31:34.820 --> 31:38.100
Even Sir George has to pay
richly, as you can see.

31:38.100 --> 31:39.740
I see everything.

31:39.740 --> 31:41.180
Howard.

31:41.180 --> 31:43.060
Rescue me from your tedious man.

31:43.060 --> 31:44.740
He does babble so.
Haxby, you will leave

31:44.740 --> 31:46.660
this house and my family's
employ at this minute.

31:46.660 --> 31:48.260
Sir, you know me
well enough to know I

31:48.260 --> 31:50.460
I know you're
a sneering hypocrite,

31:50.460 --> 31:52.780
and a thief to boot
for stealing my property!

31:52.780 --> 31:54.900
She thrust herself upon me.

32:03.220 --> 32:05.340
You gave yourself to Haxby

32:05.340 --> 32:06.580
under my roof?

32:06.580 --> 32:08.820
You drove me to it.

32:08.820 --> 32:10.060
I'm leaving.

32:10.060 --> 32:12.260
I say when you leave!

32:21.260 --> 32:23.260
You will know your place.

32:23.260 --> 32:25.500
You will...

32:50.260 --> 32:52.980
I'm taking you
to dinner tonight,

32:52.980 --> 32:55.100
so you have to behave.

32:57.740 --> 32:59.940
Wear this.

33:09.020 --> 33:11.020
I love you, Charlotte.

33:27.580 --> 33:30.020
You should have seen our girl.

33:30.020 --> 33:32.500
She had Lord Fallon eating
out of the palm of her hand.

33:36.700 --> 33:39.020
We'll lose you soon,
will we, Lucy?

33:39.020 --> 33:42.580
Going off into the world,
make your fortune.

33:42.580 --> 33:45.660
Lord Fallon will be here soon.

33:45.660 --> 33:48.260
Why don't you go upstairs,

33:48.260 --> 33:50.500
get some rest?

33:50.500 --> 33:52.180
I'll rest here, Ma.

34:23.420 --> 34:24.980
Sweet girl.

34:24.980 --> 34:27.900
You taste of
freshchurned butter.

34:50.500 --> 34:53.300
Some port?

34:53.300 --> 34:55.500
I prefer to eat.

34:55.500 --> 34:56.860
Sit.

35:25.820 --> 35:29.860
A rare and delicate fruit.

35:32.580 --> 35:36.540
Like you.

35:36.540 --> 35:40.180
My very own Persephone.

36:22.940 --> 36:25.060
These seeds

36:25.060 --> 36:27.140
seal your fate.

36:48.500 --> 36:50.540
Swallow.

36:54.500 --> 36:57.380
Feel the juice

36:57.380 --> 37:00.020
run down your throat.

37:05.500 --> 37:07.580
Now you're mine.

37:22.220 --> 37:25.380
I swear to you,
it was an elephant!

37:25.380 --> 37:27.180
I'm thinking of
sitting for a portrait,

37:27.180 --> 37:29.020
but I don't want to
pose as a wood nymph

37:29.020 --> 37:30.580
or bare too much flesh.

37:30.580 --> 37:31.980
As large as life,

37:31.980 --> 37:33.500
walking through St. James's Park

37:33.500 --> 37:36.620
on a leash, like it was
a pet hound or something.

37:39.220 --> 37:42.340
Good evening, ladies, gentlemen.

37:42.340 --> 37:44.980
My wife sends her apologies.

37:44.980 --> 37:47.020
May I present
my guest in her stead,

37:47.020 --> 37:48.500
Charlotte Wells.

37:51.700 --> 37:53.700
What are you doing, man?

37:53.700 --> 37:56.020
You insult us all,
where is Lady Caroline?

37:56.020 --> 37:57.460
She's unable to
tear herself away

37:57.460 --> 37:59.060
from the hothouse these days.

37:59.060 --> 38:00.500
Which is apt,

38:00.500 --> 38:03.060
given she has the
personality of a plant.

38:03.060 --> 38:06.060
Charlotte is my proxy wife.

38:06.060 --> 38:07.500
For God's sake,

38:07.500 --> 38:09.820
just eat your food
and leave early.

38:09.820 --> 38:11.500
I've asked her to behave.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.220
And she always listens to you?

38:13.220 --> 38:16.580
She does now
don't you, my dear?

38:16.580 --> 38:17.980
Yes.

38:20.940 --> 38:22.900
Shall we?

38:25.620 --> 38:28.020
Was everything
to your satisfaction?

38:28.020 --> 38:30.900
Your daughter...

38:30.900 --> 38:32.540
is a goddess,

38:32.540 --> 38:33.980
and I will take her into keeping

38:33.980 --> 38:35.380
and treat her as such.

38:35.380 --> 38:37.460
She's young.

38:37.460 --> 38:40.540
Her needs must be
protected by a contract.

38:40.540 --> 38:43.180
I'll have one drawn up
and sent to you,

38:43.180 --> 38:46.060
along with adequate
remuneration for you,

38:46.060 --> 38:47.900
of course.

38:47.900 --> 38:51.180
You honor us, your Lordship.

38:51.180 --> 38:52.900
I know.

39:13.300 --> 39:15.500
I'm sorry, Ma.

39:15.500 --> 39:18.540
I'll do better next time.

39:18.540 --> 39:20.820
What are you talking about?

39:20.820 --> 39:22.900
He wants you!

39:22.900 --> 39:24.980
He called you a goddess.

39:24.980 --> 39:28.020
You're going to be one of
the leading lights in London,

39:28.020 --> 39:31.220
and you'll be safe.

39:31.220 --> 39:33.420
Please don't
make me go with him.

39:33.420 --> 39:35.020
What?

39:35.020 --> 39:36.780
He scares me.

39:36.780 --> 39:38.620
Did he hurt you?

39:38.620 --> 39:41.180
He made me eat seeds.

39:41.180 --> 39:43.300
I don't understand, Lucy.

39:43.300 --> 39:45.660
You have to have a keeper!

39:45.660 --> 39:47.500
Not him.

39:47.500 --> 39:48.980
Please.

39:48.980 --> 39:51.340
Can't I just stay here

39:51.340 --> 39:53.220
and do something else,
I'm no good at this.

39:53.220 --> 39:58.180
Lord Fallon is a good
opportunity for you.

39:58.180 --> 40:00.380
We'll talk later.

40:13.940 --> 40:16.140
Charlie.

40:16.140 --> 40:17.580
Mum!

40:17.580 --> 40:19.940
Charlie, Charlie!

40:19.940 --> 40:22.020
Mumma!

40:22.020 --> 40:24.300
We have ridden out
the storm, Mrs. Quigley.

40:24.300 --> 40:26.780
Your son is in calmer waters.

40:26.780 --> 40:28.420
Charlie!

40:35.620 --> 40:38.940
Justice Cunliffe is
downstairs for you, Madam.

40:42.060 --> 40:43.820
Stay with him.

40:43.820 --> 40:45.300
Watch him.

40:55.860 --> 40:58.060
We need another girl.

40:58.060 --> 41:00.980
It is a growing monster
that must be fed.

41:02.780 --> 41:04.340
It is murder.

41:06.660 --> 41:08.780
And it is not worth my while.

41:08.780 --> 41:10.980
You have no choice,
I can have you swinging

41:10.980 --> 41:13.020
from a rope by
the end of the week.

41:13.020 --> 41:15.300
And you would be
swinging beside me.

41:17.900 --> 41:19.460
You know my price.

41:19.460 --> 41:21.860
You must be satisfied
with Lord Fallon.

41:21.860 --> 41:24.540
I cannot risk
revealing anyone else.

41:31.100 --> 41:34.820
You don't know.

41:38.820 --> 41:42.340
You don't know who
you're working for.

41:42.340 --> 41:44.940
You're merely the lackey.

41:48.060 --> 41:49.300
You don't know.

41:49.300 --> 41:52.220
Please, Lydia, you must help me.

41:52.220 --> 41:57.140
All your threats are
as nothing to me.

41:57.140 --> 42:01.140
You're scared.
And you should be too.

42:01.140 --> 42:03.620
I beg you.

42:03.620 --> 42:06.900
Yes, beg.

42:06.900 --> 42:11.020
Beg!

42:11.020 --> 42:13.500
I like that.

42:13.500 --> 42:15.820
I like that a lot.

42:23.340 --> 42:25.460
He rides for you, doesn't he?
Yeah.

42:25.460 --> 42:27.540
Want me to warm
your bed, darling?

42:30.700 --> 42:33.500
Hello, handsome,
want to take me home?

42:36.140 --> 42:38.180
I'm the Duchess of Quim!

43:11.100 --> 43:15.140
I've heard that you are
a famed wit, Miss Wells.

43:15.140 --> 43:17.540
If you have to be here,
at least entertain us.

43:17.540 --> 43:19.380
I find her wit
an unbecoming trait,

43:19.380 --> 43:20.860
Lady Rutledge.

43:20.860 --> 43:22.180
I've cured her of it.

43:22.180 --> 43:24.380
There is much that is
unbecoming in your guest,

43:24.380 --> 43:26.940
but surely a cleverness
with words and humor

43:26.940 --> 43:28.220
is to be admired.

43:28.220 --> 43:29.860
Unless you're the subject of it,

43:29.860 --> 43:31.660
which he always is.

43:33.020 --> 43:34.900
Is that why you left
your wife at home?

43:34.900 --> 43:36.980
She can be most
satirical about you.

43:38.540 --> 43:41.220
Few people think
Sir George is very clever,

43:41.220 --> 43:42.940
but he's solved
the eternal mystery

43:42.940 --> 43:47.300
of how to tame a shrew
in one afternoon.

43:47.300 --> 43:49.540
Why don't you tell them
how you did it?

43:49.540 --> 43:51.580
Charlotte.

43:51.580 --> 43:53.340
These are your friends.

43:53.340 --> 43:54.500
Surely you want to assist them

43:54.500 --> 43:58.900
with the capricious
women in their lives.

43:58.900 --> 44:01.060
Tell them how you got me
to behave tonight.

44:03.980 --> 44:05.340
I do apologize.

44:05.340 --> 44:07.540
I fear I overstepped the
mark in bringing Miss Wells.

44:07.540 --> 44:08.700
We're leaving.

44:08.700 --> 44:11.300
How will you make me?

44:11.300 --> 44:13.420
Will you punch me again
with all your might?

44:13.420 --> 44:15.420
Charlotte!
Will you pin me to the bed,

44:15.420 --> 44:17.140
tell me that you're
my lord and master

44:17.140 --> 44:18.460
and rape me?

44:18.460 --> 44:20.420
Is that what you will do again,

44:20.420 --> 44:22.380
rape me?

44:24.300 --> 44:26.060
You see now her cruel wit.

44:26.060 --> 44:28.060
I see no wit,

44:28.060 --> 44:29.700
only cruelty.

44:35.140 --> 44:37.500
I suggest we retire
to the drawing room,

44:37.500 --> 44:39.420
where the air is better.

44:39.420 --> 44:41.020
I'm leaving too,

44:41.020 --> 44:43.420
lest his violence follows me.

44:47.500 --> 44:50.020
Bad form, old fellow.

44:50.020 --> 44:52.660
You don't believe
any of this, do you?
