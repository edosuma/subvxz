♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:14.041 --> 00:17.542
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

00:17.583 --> 00:19.542

00:19.583 --> 00:22.583
I NEED YOU.

00:22.625 --> 00:26.250

00:26.291 --> 00:28.750
OH. (laughs)

00:28.792 --> 00:30.250
OH, GOD, YOU...

00:30.291 --> 00:31.250
(chuckles)

00:31.291 --> 00:33.250
OH, YOU JUST...

00:33.291 --> 00:37.000
YOU BRING SOMETHING OUT
IN ME.

00:39.291 --> 00:43.041
WELL, I'D LIKE TO THINK
IT'S THE BEST IN YOU.

00:43.083 --> 00:45.041
OR THE WORST.

00:45.083 --> 00:46.250
OOH.

(laughs)

00:53.041 --> 00:55.792
MM.

00:55.834 --> 00:58.250
(laughs) ARCHER.

00:58.291 --> 01:01.417
OH, ARCHER. WHY ARE YOU
BEING SUCH A TEASE?

01:01.458 --> 01:03.792
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:03.834 --> 01:05.458
(groaning)
ARCHER?

01:05.500 --> 01:09.041
ARCHER? ARCHER?!

01:09.083 --> 01:10.583
(groaning continues)

01:10.625 --> 01:13.041
ARCHER.

01:13.083 --> 01:14.709
(gasping)

01:14.750 --> 01:17.709
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE OKAY.
YOU'RE OKAY.

01:17.750 --> 01:25.583
(gasping continues)
YOU'RE OKAY.

01:25.625 --> 01:28.667
(screaming)
OKAY. GOOD, GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD.

01:28.709 --> 01:30.875
SHE'S AT--
SHE'S AT PLUS-2 STATION.
THAT'S GOOD.

01:30.917 --> 01:32.875
WHERE'S NAOMI?
SHE PROMISED SHE'D COME.

01:32.917 --> 01:34.709
WE PAGED HER.
HOPEFULLY SHE'LL COME.

01:34.750 --> 01:37.041
BUT WE PROMISE YOU, MAGGIE,
YOU'RE IN VERY GOOD HANDS.

01:37.083 --> 01:38.667
I HAVE EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL.

01:38.709 --> 01:41.542
BUT SHE'S MY GOOD LUCK CHARM.
WHERE IS SHE?

01:41.583 --> 01:44.417
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

01:44.458 --> 01:47.041
DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK.
I'M FINE.
YOU'RE NOT FINE.

01:47.083 --> 01:49.458
YOU HAD A SEIZURE.
BLOOD PRESSURE'S 120 OVER 80.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.875
PULSE--REGULAR AND 70.

01:50.917 --> 01:52.458
EYES--EQUAL AND RESPONSIVE.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.458
YOU KNOW YOU NEED--
NO TESTS.
I DON'T EVEN NEED TO BE HERE.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.709
I TOLD YOU THAT.
I TOLD THE PARAMEDICS THAT.

01:57.750 --> 02:00.291
A HEALTHY PERSON YOUR AGE
DOES NOT JUST HAVE

02:00.333 --> 02:03.375
A-A TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE
OUT OF THE BLUE.
ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

02:03.417 --> 02:06.250
I'M THE BADASS BRAIN GUY.
YES, I HAD A SEIZURE.

02:06.291 --> 02:09.041
AND WHILE I COULD LECTURE YOU
ON THE FACT THAT THE BRAIN

02:09.083 --> 02:12.291
IS A COMPLEX ORGAN FIRING OFF
NEURONS AND ELECTRICAL IMPULSES

02:12.333 --> 02:14.542
WHICH OCCASIONALLY
SHORT-CIRCUIT

02:14.583 --> 02:16.875
FOR TOTALLY BENIGN REASONS,

02:16.917 --> 02:19.750
INSTEAD,
I'M SIGNING MYSELF OUT.
WHAT,
AGAINST ALL MEDICAL ADVICE?

02:19.792 --> 02:22.041
AGAINST YOUR MEDICAL ADVICE,
WHICH MAKES YOU MY DOCTOR,

02:22.083 --> 02:24.750
SO YOU HAVE DOCTOR-PATIENT
CONFIDENTIALITY.

02:24.792 --> 02:28.333
WHAT? WAIT, WAIT, YOU WANT ME
TO LIE TO ADDISON?
YES.

02:33.417 --> 02:35.792
(woman) DR. BLAIR,
DR. BLAIR...

02:39.792 --> 02:41.542
(exhales)

02:41.583 --> 02:43.542
YEAH,
YOU NEED TO SEE SOMEONE.

02:43.583 --> 02:45.000
I'M FINE.

02:45.041 --> 02:47.000
NO, YOU'RE--YOU'RE A DOCTOR.
YOU KNOW BETTER.

02:47.041 --> 02:50.000
YOU NEED TO SEE ADDISON OR NAOMI
ABOUT THE PREGNANCY TODAY.
(coughs)

02:50.041 --> 02:52.417
AND YOU SOUND LIKE CRAP.
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE MOVING IN

02:52.458 --> 02:55.417
TO BE THE PREGNANCY POLICE.
I AM YOUR FRIEND,
AND I'M HELPING YOU OUT,

02:55.458 --> 02:57.417
AND I HAVE THE ADDED BENEFIT

02:57.458 --> 02:59.417
OF BEING
A HIGHLY TRAINED PHYSICIAN.

02:59.458 --> 03:02.375
SO AS LONG
AS YOU ARE PREGNANT--

03:02.417 --> 03:04.000
SHELDON.

03:07.583 --> 03:09.000
(clears throat)

03:09.041 --> 03:10.792
COOPER, VIOLET.

03:12.166 --> 03:14.250
TOGETHER AGAIN.

03:14.291 --> 03:16.000
LOOK, WE'RE NOT--

03:16.041 --> 03:19.041
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
THAT WAS HUMOR.

03:19.083 --> 03:21.375
(chuckles)
(Cooper chuckles)

03:21.417 --> 03:23.125
IT JUST SEEMS, UM,

03:23.166 --> 03:26.792
WELL, THE OFFICE, THE ELEVATOR,
YOUR HOUSE, TOGETHER--

03:26.834 --> 03:28.583
IT'S, UH... IT'S NICE.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.041
YES. IT IS NICE.

03:31.083 --> 03:32.625
WE'RE FRIENDS.

03:32.667 --> 03:34.000
OF COURSE.

03:34.041 --> 03:36.959
YOU KNOW, YOU CALLED ME
THE OTHER DAY.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.792
I'M SORRY. I SHOULD'VE--
WELL, WE'RE ALL BUSY PEOPLE.

03:39.834 --> 03:44.250
YOU'LL CALL ME...
WHEN YOU HAVE TIME.
(elevator bell dings)

03:44.291 --> 03:47.250
OH, LOOK...
THE HAPPY COUPLE.

03:47.291 --> 03:49.667
THIS HAS GOTTA STOP.

03:49.709 --> 03:51.208
WE HAVE TO TALK.

03:51.250 --> 03:53.583
WHEN YOU CAN EXPLAIN
MOVING IN WITH VIOLET,

03:53.625 --> 03:55.041
WE WILL.

03:55.083 --> 03:58.041
IF YOU KNEW WHY, YOU WOULD SEE
THAT IT'S ACTUALLY RIGHT.

03:58.083 --> 03:59.583
IF I KNEW WHY,
WHICH I DON'T.

03:59.625 --> 04:02.709
SO RIGHT NOW,
YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A GUY

04:02.750 --> 04:06.458
WHO MOVED IN
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

04:06.500 --> 04:10.208
(screams)
WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG?
SHE'S STILL AT PLUS-2, ADDISON.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.041
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IT MEANS THAT THE LABOR'S
NOT PROGRESSING,

04:12.083 --> 04:14.125
AND THE BABY HAS
VARIABLE DECELS.

04:14.166 --> 04:15.834
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO PERFORM
AN ASSISTED DELIVERY

04:15.875 --> 04:18.041
TO HELP GUIDE THE BABY OUT.
IT'S VERY SAFE.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.667
DELL, WOULD YOU PREP
THE VACUUM EXTRACTOR, PLEASE?

04:20.709 --> 04:22.542
VACUUM WHAT?!
IT'S GONNA BE FINE, HONEY.

04:22.583 --> 04:25.625
(whispers) I'VE NEVER
DONE ONE OF THESE.

04:25.667 --> 04:28.333
IT'S OKAY.
I'LL GUIDE YOU THROUGH IT.

04:28.375 --> 04:31.417
OKAY, PLACE THE CUP
DIRECTLY ON THE VERTEX.
OKAY.

04:31.458 --> 04:33.625
GOOD. NOW, MAGGIE,
WHEN I TELL YOU,

04:33.667 --> 04:36.500
I NEED YOU TO PUSH
AS HARD AS YOU CAN,

04:36.542 --> 04:39.625
AND WHILE YOU PUSH, WE WILL
TAKE THE BABY OUT, OKAY?

04:39.667 --> 04:41.625
OKAY. READY? AND PUSH.

04:41.667 --> 04:44.208
(screams)

04:44.250 --> 04:46.667
THAT'S GREAT, MAGGIE.
THE BABY'S CROWNING.

04:46.709 --> 04:49.583
TAKE IT OUT! TAKE IT OUT!
TAKE IT OUT!
OKAY.

04:49.625 --> 04:51.667
(baby crying)

04:51.709 --> 04:53.959
IT'S A GIRL.
IT'S A BABY GIRL.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.250
CONGRATULATIONS.

04:56.291 --> 04:58.709
THE DISCOLORATION
ON HER HEAD?
IT'S JUST A HEMATOMA.

04:58.750 --> 05:01.125
IT HAPPENS SOMETIMES
WITH A VACUUM DELIVERY.

05:01.166 --> 05:02.667
HER APGAR IS LOW.

05:02.709 --> 05:04.375
DELL, DON'T WORRY.

05:04.417 --> 05:06.542
(fusses)

05:06.583 --> 05:08.500
SHE'S FINE.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.500
YOU DID GREAT.

05:10.542 --> 05:12.041
WAIT, WAIT.

05:12.083 --> 05:14.959
I THOUGHT YOU AND CHARLOTTE
WERE BACK TOGETHER.
WE WERE.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.500
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

05:16.542 --> 05:18.041
WELL, I, UH...
SHE'S...

05:18.083 --> 05:19.750
IT'S COMPLICATED.

05:19.792 --> 05:22.792
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
I LIKE ABOUT SONYA?
SHE'S NOT COMPLICATED?

05:22.834 --> 05:24.792
SHE SAYS EXACTLY
WHAT SHE THINKS.

05:24.834 --> 05:26.959
WELL, BE CAREFUL
WHAT YOU WISH FOR.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.959
DR. FREEDMAN?
PATTY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.333
I THOUGHT I WAS MEETING YOU
AT THE HOSPITAL LATER.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.500
MOM SAID WE SHOULD COME HERE
BEFORE SURGERY.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.792
OH, WHERE IS SHE?
SHE WENT TO GO GET MONEY
AND SHE'S NOT BACK YET.

05:37.834 --> 05:40.041
(lowers voice) AND I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM, BAD.

05:40.083 --> 05:42.750
(whispers) IT'S--IT'S RIGHT DOWN
THE HALL TO YOUR LEFT.

05:42.792 --> 05:44.542
(normal voice)
THANKS. OH, I FORGOT.

05:44.583 --> 05:47.000
MOM SAID
I SHOULD GIVE YOU THIS.

05:56.583 --> 05:58.583
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

05:58.625 --> 06:00.333
HER PARENTS, UH...

06:00.375 --> 06:03.041
THEY DUMPED HER.

06:03.083 --> 06:05.000
THEY'RE NOT COMING BACK.

06:09.875 --> 06:12.041
HEY. YOU'RE HERE.

06:12.083 --> 06:13.834
OH, Y-YEAH.
I PAGED YOU.

06:13.875 --> 06:16.375
JAKE AND MAGGIE KLEIN
WERE ASKING FOR YOU.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.250
THEY HAD THEIR BABY. BETH.

06:18.291 --> 06:20.375
THAT'S WONDERFUL. WONDERFUL.
YOU OKAY?

06:20.417 --> 06:21.750
YEAH, I JUST, UM...

06:21.792 --> 06:23.750
I, UH, HAD A ROUGH MORNING.

06:23.792 --> 06:26.625
LOOK, IF MY BROTHER'S
CAUSING YOU TROUBLE,

06:26.667 --> 06:28.667
JUST DUMP HIM.

06:28.709 --> 06:31.625
(laughs) COME ON.
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY.

06:31.667 --> 06:33.500
YEAH, I, UM...

06:33.542 --> 06:37.834
YOU KNOW WHAT? (sighs)
CAN YOU EXCUSE ME A MINUTE?

06:45.542 --> 06:48.166
I HATE LIES.
SOMETHING IS WRONG.

06:48.208 --> 06:51.709
I'M FINE. CLOSE THE DOOR.
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW FINE I AM.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.458
IT'S NOT FUNNY.
IF YOU WERE FINE,

06:53.500 --> 06:55.583
YOU WOULD'VE LET THE DOCTOR
EXAMINE YOU TODAY.

06:55.625 --> 06:58.041
YOU WOULD'VE LET THEM RUN TESTS.
SO WHAT IS IT?

06:58.083 --> 07:00.583
IS IT AN ANEURYSM OR A STROKE
OR--OR A.V.M.?

07:00.625 --> 07:03.125
WHO'S THE NEUROLOGIST HERE?
WELL, YOU WON'T TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON,

07:03.166 --> 07:05.959
AND I'M--I'M THINKING
THE WORST HERE, ARCHER.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.291
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW SCARY
IT WAS FOR ME THIS MORNING.

07:10.333 --> 07:11.917
(sighs)

07:11.959 --> 07:13.750
I'M SORRY.

07:13.792 --> 07:15.750
SORRY IS NOT GONNA MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.

07:15.792 --> 07:17.625
SORRY IS NOT
GONNA MAKE ME NOT WORRY.

07:17.667 --> 07:19.875
YOU NEED TO TELL ME
WHAT'S WRONG.

07:19.917 --> 07:23.542
I CAN HELP YOU. COME ON.
WE CAN--WE CAN FIGURE IT OUT.

07:27.542 --> 07:29.041
(sighs)

07:29.083 --> 07:30.625
IT'S A TUMOR--

07:30.667 --> 07:33.500
A GLIOMA IN THE THIRD VENTRICLE
OF MY BRAIN.

07:36.834 --> 07:38.375
UM, CAN--

07:38.417 --> 07:41.041
IT'S INOPERABLE.
THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO.

07:48.417 --> 07:51.417
(typing on keyboard)

07:54.542 --> 07:56.458
HEY.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.959
THERE'S SOMETHING I...

07:59.000 --> 08:00.709
WANT TO TELL ADDISON,

08:00.750 --> 08:01.375
BUT I CAN'T.

08:01.417 --> 08:02.875
YOU CAN'T?

08:02.917 --> 08:06.500
I WAS ASKED SPECIFICALLY
BY SOMEONE NOT TO TELL.

08:06.542 --> 08:08.417
YOU WERE ASKED SPECIFICALLY
BY SOMEONE

08:08.458 --> 08:11.000
NOT TO TELL ADDISON
SOMETHING SPECIFIC?

08:11.041 --> 08:15.000
OKAY, UH, UP TO A WEEK AGO, I
WOULD'VE SAID PETE, MAYBE COOP.

08:15.041 --> 08:18.083
BUT THIS DEFINITELY REEKS
OF ARCHER.

08:18.125 --> 08:21.417
IT, UH, IT INVOLVES
DOCTOR-PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.625
WHICH WOULD APPLY
IF YOU WERE ARCHER'S DOCTOR,

08:23.667 --> 08:27.041
WHICH YOU'RE NOT, UNLESS HE'S
TRYING TO GET PREGNANT.

08:27.083 --> 08:30.417
(scoffs)
I'M SORRY. YOU'RE NOT
GIVING ME MUCH TO GO ON HERE.

08:30.458 --> 08:32.625
IT'S SOMETHING MEDICAL.

08:32.667 --> 08:35.041
OKAY.

08:35.083 --> 08:38.041
SO, UH,
DO YOU KEEP A SECRET

08:38.083 --> 08:40.417
FOR A MAN THAT YOU CARE ABOUT,

08:40.458 --> 08:43.208
OR DO YOU LIE
TO YOUR BEST FRIEND?

08:50.083 --> 08:51.417
HOW'S SHE DOING?

08:51.458 --> 08:53.417
SHE ISN'T RESPONDING
TO THE PACIFIER,

08:53.458 --> 08:55.041
AND SHE'S BARELY CRIED,

08:55.083 --> 08:58.041
AND--AND THE BRUISE,
IT LOOKS WORSE.
WELL, HER COLOR'S GOOD.

08:58.083 --> 09:00.750
SHE'S ACTIVE.
LET'S SEE THOSE FEET.

09:00.792 --> 09:04.000
(baby coos)
SHE RESPONDS TO STIMULATION.

09:04.041 --> 09:07.041
MAYBE YOU SHOULD ORDER A C.T.
OR AN M.R.I. JUST TO BE SURE.

09:07.083 --> 09:09.667
DELL, THIS IS ALL WITHIN
THE RANGE OF NORMAL

09:09.709 --> 09:12.667
AFTER AN ASSISTED DELIVERY.
YEAH, BUT IF THERE'S
A CHANCE SOMETHING'S WRONG, I--

09:12.709 --> 09:15.041
SOMETHING YOU COULD...
I JUST, I WANT HER TO BE OKAY.

09:15.083 --> 09:17.417
I KNOW YOU DO,
AND SO DO I.

09:17.458 --> 09:19.291
BUT THIS BABY ISN'T SICK.

09:19.333 --> 09:22.000
OKAY.

09:26.458 --> 09:28.417
UH, PATTY'S PARENTS
AREN'T ANSWERING THEIR PHONE,

09:28.458 --> 09:30.792
AND THERE'S NO CONTACT
INFORMATION FOR THEIR WORK

09:30.834 --> 09:33.041
OR FOR THEIR CELLS.
HOW DID SHE HURT HER KNEE?

09:33.083 --> 09:34.458
CAR ACCIDENT. SHE WAS 5.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.041
IT WAS HIT-AND-RUN AND...
INTERNAL INJURIES,

09:37.083 --> 09:39.458
WHICH, YOU KNOW, SHE GOT OVER.
WALKING HAS BEEN HARD.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.041
WE'VE HAD TO WAIT
FOR THE BONE TO GROW MORE

09:42.083 --> 09:45.667
BEFORE WE COULD
RECONSTRUCT THE KNEE.
AND HER PARENTS JUST WALKED OUT
THE DAY OF THE SURGERY?

09:45.709 --> 09:49.041
PATTY IS OUT THERE
READING TO HER TEDDY BEAR.
I HAVEN'T TOLD HER YET.

09:49.083 --> 09:51.709
I TOLD HER HER PARENTS
WERE STILL AT THE BANK

09:51.750 --> 09:54.500
AND THAT THINGS WERE TAKING
LONGER THAN THEY SHOULD.
COOPER, SHE KNOWS
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

09:54.542 --> 09:56.875
YOU KNOW THAT. KIDS KNOW
WHEN SOMETHING'S WRONG.

09:56.917 --> 09:59.709
YOU HAVE TO REPORT THIS.
HER PARENTS ARE GOOD PEOPLE.

09:59.750 --> 10:01.500
THEY ABANDONED A SICK CHILD.

10:01.542 --> 10:05.083
CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES
NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED.
YEAH, AND THE POLICE.

10:05.125 --> 10:07.250
THE SAFE HAVEN PROGRAM
IS FOR BABIES.

10:07.291 --> 10:09.500
THIS IS ABANDONMENT.
HER PARENTS ARE HAVING
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS.

10:09.542 --> 10:12.041
MAYBE THEY'RE JUST FREAKED OUT
BY THE SURGERY.

10:12.083 --> 10:14.291
JUST GIVE ME A FEW HOURS.
I'LL FIND THEM.

10:14.333 --> 10:16.458
THE SURGERY'S ELECTIVE.

10:16.500 --> 10:19.291
IF WE TURN HER OVER
TO FAMILY SERVICES,

10:19.333 --> 10:22.542
THEY WON'T PAY FOR IT,
AND SHE NEEDS THE SURGERY.

10:22.583 --> 10:25.125
SHE NEEDS HER PARENTS.
WELL, NOT ALL PARENTS
SHOULD BE PARENTS.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.375
SO IF YOU WANT TO,
GO LOOK FOR THEM,

10:27.417 --> 10:30.000
BUT--BUT LET ME
TALK TO HER FIRST.

10:30.041 --> 10:32.709
LET'S MAKE SURE THIS FAMILY IS
WORTH BEING PUT BACK TOGETHER.
OKAY.

10:32.750 --> 10:35.291
SO DR. COOPER--IS HE, LIKE,
YOUR BEST FRIEND?

10:35.333 --> 10:36.709
UH-HUH.

10:36.750 --> 10:39.542
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
YOU HAVE A BEST FRIEND?

10:39.583 --> 10:41.542
UH-HUH. FELIX.

10:41.583 --> 10:44.125
AND DOES FELIX LIVE AT HOME
WITH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY?

10:44.166 --> 10:45.500
UH-HUH.

10:45.542 --> 10:47.709
WHAT DOES
A FAMILY LOOK LIKE?

10:47.750 --> 10:49.709
CAN YOU SHOW ME
WITH THE DOLLS?

10:49.750 --> 10:53.041
UM, WELL, THERE'S A MOMMY

10:53.083 --> 10:57.083
AND A DADDY AND ME...
AND FELIX.

10:57.125 --> 10:59.542
OKAY. SO I'M GONNA START
A SENTENCE,

10:59.583 --> 11:01.542
AND I WANT YOU
TO FINISH IT, OKAY?

11:01.583 --> 11:04.542
SO I'LL SAY, UM...
I LIKE IT WHEN MY MOMMY...

11:04.583 --> 11:06.709
AND THEN YOU SAY...
HUGS ME.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.542
GREAT. AND I DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN MY MOMMY...

11:09.583 --> 11:11.375
GETS SAD.

11:11.417 --> 11:14.500
AND WHAT ABOUT THE DADDY?

11:14.542 --> 11:16.500
WHAT DOES THE DADDY DO?

11:16.542 --> 11:19.041
A DADDY COMES HOME AT NIGHT.

11:19.083 --> 11:22.125
AND WHAT DOES HE DO
WHEN HE COMES HOME AT NIGHT?

11:22.166 --> 11:25.417
HE CRAWLS INTO BED WITH ME.

11:25.458 --> 11:29.166
AND WHAT DOES HE DO WHEN HE
CRAWLS INTO BED WITH YOU?

11:29.208 --> 11:31.166
SOMETIMES HE READS ME A STORY,

11:31.208 --> 11:34.583
BUT MOST OF THE TIME,
HE JUST SNORES.

11:37.917 --> 11:40.458
MM.

11:42.417 --> 11:44.375
I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

11:44.417 --> 11:47.417
SOMETHING GOOD
OR SOMETHING BAD?

11:47.458 --> 11:49.417
SOMETHING BAD.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.417
ARCHER ASKED ME
NOT TO TELL YOU,

11:51.458 --> 11:54.041
BUT, UM--
WHAT DID HE DO TO YOU?

11:54.083 --> 11:56.208
LAST NIGHT,
ARCHER HAD A SEIZURE.

11:56.250 --> 11:59.834
AND IT'S NOT THE FIRST SEIZURE
HE'S HAD, ADDISON.

11:59.875 --> 12:02.000
IT'S CANCER...

12:02.041 --> 12:03.500
A GLIOMA.

12:03.542 --> 12:07.041
IT'S... INOPERABLE.

12:07.083 --> 12:09.458
HE SAYS HE SAW EVERYONE
IN NEW YORK--

12:09.500 --> 12:12.458
C.T. SCANS,

12:12.500 --> 12:14.625
SECOND OPINIONS,
THIRD OPINIONS--

12:14.667 --> 12:19.125
AND HE SAYS THAT THERE IS
NOTHING TO DO.

12:21.458 --> 12:23.041
WHERE IS HE NOW?

12:23.083 --> 12:24.500
HE'S DOWNSTAIRS.

12:24.542 --> 12:26.667
HE SAYS HE DOESN'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

12:26.709 --> 12:30.041
RIGHT. WELL, WE'LL GET, UH,
HIS SCANS FROM NEW YORK.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.208
WE'LL FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT
IT IS AND HOW WE FIGHT IT.

12:33.250 --> 12:35.041
ADDISON,
YOU CAN'T JUST START--

12:35.083 --> 12:38.875
DON'T TELL ME WHAT I CAN
AND CAN'T DO, NAI.

12:38.917 --> 12:40.875
I'M HIS SISTER, I'M A DOCTOR,

12:40.917 --> 12:43.041
AND THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING
THAT WE CAN DO.

12:43.083 --> 12:47.000
(sighs)

12:49.667 --> 12:51.542
SO?
WELL, EVERYTHING
SHE DEMONSTRATED--

12:51.583 --> 12:55.208
CONCEPT OF FAMILY STRUCTURE,
PARENT-CHILD ROLES--

12:55.250 --> 12:58.333
SUGGESTS THAT THE FAMILY LIFE
IS HEALTHY.
SO IF I CAN FIND 'EM...

12:58.375 --> 13:01.583
GO FIND 'EM.

13:04.583 --> 13:07.458
HEY, UH, COULD I BORROW YOU
FOR A FEW MINUTES?

13:07.500 --> 13:09.458
IT'S, UH, KIND OF IMPORTANT.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.709
ADDISON, I AM SO SORRY.

13:15.750 --> 13:18.041
I SAW HIM YESTERDAY
ON THE ELEVATOR. HE WAS FINE.

13:18.083 --> 13:20.667
DON'T TALK ABOUT HIM
LIKE HE'S DEAD.
HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM?

13:20.709 --> 13:23.125
NO. I'M TRYING TO GET
HIS SCANS FROM NEW YORK.

13:23.166 --> 13:25.083
I NEED AMMUNITION.
ADDISON--

13:25.125 --> 13:27.083
IF YOU GIVE ME
SOME "STAGES OF GRIEF" CRAP,

13:27.125 --> 13:29.583
I WILL THROW SOMETHING.

13:29.625 --> 13:32.083
OKAY, LOOK, I DON'T NEED
THE SUPER FRIENDS HERE, OKAY?

13:32.125 --> 13:33.792
I DON'T NEED MORAL SUPPORT.

13:33.834 --> 13:36.041
I'M FINE, HE'S NOT,
AND I'M GONNA FIX IT.

13:36.083 --> 13:39.083
WELL, UH, NAI SAYS
HE'S TAKING IT WELL.
YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING, SAM?
HE'S CREATING DRAMA

13:39.125 --> 13:40.917
LIKE HE ALWAYS DOES.
SECRETS...

13:40.959 --> 13:45.083
I KNOW HE DOESN'T WANT HELP,
BUT HE'S GOTTA BE SCARED.

13:45.125 --> 13:48.083
I KNOW I WOULD BE.
I MEAN, LOOK AT ALL OF US.

13:48.125 --> 13:51.583
NONE OF US
WANTS TO THINK THAT...
YEAH.

13:51.625 --> 13:54.333
GOT IT.
(Naomi) WHAT, HIS SCANS?

13:54.375 --> 13:57.166
THEY RELEASED THEM TO YOU?
AFTER 15 PHONE CALLS
TO EVERY HOSPITAL IN NEW YORK,

13:57.208 --> 13:59.166
TEN CALLS TO EVERY NEUROLOGIST

13:59.208 --> 14:01.709
AND ONE VERY EFFECTIVE E-MAIL
TO THE DOCTOR

14:01.750 --> 14:05.041
WHO WROTE THE PREFACE
TO ARCHER'S LAST BOOK.
(computer beeps)

14:05.083 --> 14:06.792
(exhales deeply)

14:06.834 --> 14:09.750
(computer clicks)

14:09.792 --> 14:11.667
(beep)

14:17.625 --> 14:19.834
ADDISON...

14:31.041 --> 14:33.041
(door opens)

14:33.083 --> 14:35.667
YOU WANTED A CONSULT ON...

14:38.000 --> 14:42.542
YOU CONVENED A PANEL?
THE DOCTOR SAYS
IT'S OPERABLE.

14:42.583 --> 14:44.542
ONE THOUGHT SO.
THREE DOCTORS SAID NO.

14:44.583 --> 14:48.333
THEY'D HAVE TO TEAR THROUGH
HALF OF MY BRAIN TO GET THIS.
WHAT ABOUT CHEMO?

14:48.375 --> 14:50.500
(Pete) RADIATION?
CHEMO IS NOT PROVEN EFFECTIVE
WITH THIS KIND OF LESION,

14:50.542 --> 14:53.166
AND RADIATION WOULD FRY
ALL BRAIN TISSUE

14:53.208 --> 14:55.667
BEFORE IT MADE A DENT.
I'D LOSE MY SENSE OF HUMOR.
YOU CAN'T JUST GIVE UP.

14:55.709 --> 14:58.625
I'M NOT GIVING UP.
AT THE RATE THIS IS GROWING,

14:58.667 --> 15:00.041
I COULD HAVE FIVE YEARS--

15:00.083 --> 15:02.458
FIVE GREAT YEARS,
AND I GET TO KEEP ALL MY HAIR.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.625
I'LL ADJUST
MY SEIZURE MEDICATION.
WHAT IF IT'S NOT SLOW GROWING?

15:04.667 --> 15:07.500
WHAT IF, INSTEAD OF A COUPLE OF
YEARS, IT'S A COUPLE OF MONTHS

15:07.542 --> 15:10.458
OR WORSE?
WHEN WAS YOUR LAST C.T. SCAN?

15:10.500 --> 15:13.667
YOU KNOW HER. SHE'S NOT
GONNA GIVE UP ON THIS.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.875
THESE WERE MY LAST.

15:18.917 --> 15:22.542
THEY WERE TAKEN, UH...
THREE WEEKS AGO.

15:22.583 --> 15:24.834
THEY FOLLOWED A SET
FROM TWO MONTHS AGO

15:24.875 --> 15:29.458
AND ANOTHER SET BEFORE THAT.
WAIT, READ THAT DATE AGAIN.
THIS TIME, DON'T TILT YOUR HEAD.

15:29.500 --> 15:32.041
WHAT?

15:32.083 --> 15:35.458
YEAH. HE HAS
AN UPWARD GAZE PALSY.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.750
SAM'S RIGHT.
YOU CAN'T LOOK UP.

15:37.792 --> 15:40.834
BUT THAT'S NOT CONSISTENT WITH
THIRD-VENTRICLE GLIOMA, IS IT?

15:40.875 --> 15:43.959
WELL, WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?

15:44.000 --> 15:48.166
WE NEED TO DO ANOTHER C.T. SCAN.
WE NEED TO DO IT NOW.

16:01.125 --> 16:03.750
(doorknob clicks)

16:03.792 --> 16:05.291
LAURIE!

16:05.333 --> 16:07.000
GEORGE!

16:32.959 --> 16:34.667
(whispers) HEY.

16:48.083 --> 16:51.417
(sighs)
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL, ISN'T SHE?

16:51.458 --> 16:53.000
VERY.

16:53.041 --> 16:55.125
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

16:55.166 --> 16:57.792
BEAT UP... BUT HAPPY.

16:57.834 --> 16:59.792
JAKE WENT HOME
TO TAKE A SHOWER.

16:59.834 --> 17:03.542
THANKS FOR TAKING CARE OF HER
SO I COULD GET SOME SLEEP.

17:05.166 --> 17:08.041
HAS SHE, UH,
HAS SHE NURSED YET?

17:08.083 --> 17:09.500
NO.

17:11.083 --> 17:13.417
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG,
DELL?

17:13.458 --> 17:15.625
NO. EVERYTHING'S FINE.

17:15.667 --> 17:18.458
OKAY, HERE.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.583
(coos)

17:26.500 --> 17:29.250
(typing on keyboard)

17:31.083 --> 17:33.834
YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME.
ADDIE--

17:33.875 --> 17:35.834
NO. WHAT, YOU MOVED TO L.A.

17:35.875 --> 17:38.458
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE CLOSER
TO ME? AND IT'S A LIE.

17:38.500 --> 17:41.000
YOU LIED.
YOU KNEW YOU WERE SICK.

17:41.041 --> 17:44.291
YOU KNEW AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.
WHAT--WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
I WANTED TO MAKE UP
FOR LOST TIME.

17:44.333 --> 17:47.041
WHAT, BY LYING TO ME
WHEN I CAN HELP YOU?

17:47.083 --> 17:50.250
AND THEN YOU TELL NAOMI?
SHE SAW THE SEIZURE.
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

17:50.291 --> 17:52.250
OH, PLEASE.
WELL, WHATEVER'S GOING ON,

17:52.291 --> 17:55.667
THERE IS SOMETHING IN MY BRAIN
THAT CAN'T COME OUT.

17:55.709 --> 17:58.583
AND NOW THAT YOU KNOW,
EVERYTHING'S ABOUT ME DYING.

17:58.625 --> 18:01.166
YOU GOT THAT LOOK IN YOUR EYE,
THAT UNDERLYING PITY.
IT'S NOT PITY.

18:01.208 --> 18:04.041
IT IS, AND I DIDN'T WANT TO COME
HERE AND LOOK AT YOU EVERY DAY

18:04.083 --> 18:07.208
AND SEE THAT.
YOU ARE MY BROTHER, ARCHER.
YOU'RE THE ONLY FAMILY I HAVE--

18:07.250 --> 18:10.000
THE ONLY SANE FAMILY--
We're ready.

18:14.709 --> 18:17.959
THIS IS REALLY GONNA MAKE
YOUR KNEE FEEL BETTER, OKAY?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.333
IT'S OKAY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SCARED.

18:20.375 --> 18:22.542
IT DOESN'T HURT THAT MUCH.

18:22.583 --> 18:25.041
HE IS REALLY BRAVE.
WHAT'S HIS NAME AGAIN?

18:25.083 --> 18:26.667
FELIX.

18:26.709 --> 18:28.667
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, FELIX?

18:28.709 --> 18:31.542
WE... ARE...

18:34.083 --> 18:36.041
DONE.

18:36.083 --> 18:39.542
SO IF YOUR PARENTS
HAD TROUBLE AT THE BANK,

18:39.583 --> 18:41.542
WHO DO YOU THINK
THEY'D CALL?

18:41.583 --> 18:44.041
I DON'T KNOW.
WELL, I MEAN,
DO YOUR MOM AND DAD

18:44.083 --> 18:46.709
HAVE A GOOD FRIEND
THEY TALK TO A LOT OR...

18:46.750 --> 18:49.166
MY MOM TALKS TO AUNT KATIE.
IS THAT YOUR MOM'S SISTER?

18:49.208 --> 18:52.041
DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE LIVES?
NEAR DISNEYLAND.

18:52.083 --> 18:53.709
MM-HMM.

18:53.750 --> 18:55.875
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO THEM?

18:55.917 --> 18:59.083
DID THEY
GET INTO AN ACCIDENT?
NO.

18:59.125 --> 19:02.667
ARE THEY DEAD?
NO, NO. GOD, NO.

19:02.709 --> 19:05.667
YOUR PARENTS, UM...

19:05.709 --> 19:08.000
I THINK THEY'RE GOING THROUGH
A TOUGH TIME,

19:08.041 --> 19:12.709
AND... THEY NEED TO
FIGURE SOME THINGS OUT.

19:12.750 --> 19:15.166
YOU'RE LYING.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.917
(computer beeps)

19:21.959 --> 19:23.333
(clicks keyboard keys)

19:23.375 --> 19:25.750
(beeping)

19:25.792 --> 19:28.750
(keyboard key clicks
and computer beeps)

19:28.792 --> 19:30.792
IT'S ALMOST TWICE THE SIZE.

19:30.834 --> 19:33.333
AND THERE ARE TWO MORE LESIONS
ON THE CORTEX.

19:33.375 --> 19:35.583
A TUMOR WOULDN'T EXPAND
THAT QUICKLY.

19:35.625 --> 19:38.417
NO, NO, IT WOULDN'T.
IS IT METASTATIC?
NOT IN THIS POSITION.

19:38.458 --> 19:40.041
MULTIFOCAL ABSCESS?

19:40.083 --> 19:43.000
NO, NO FEVER, NO SOURCE.
THEN... WHAT?

19:43.041 --> 19:46.041
WELL, MAYBE...
ZIHUATANEJO.

19:46.083 --> 19:47.709
WHAT?
ZIHUATANEJO.

19:47.750 --> 19:50.542
I WAS THERE SIX MONTHS AGO
FOR A BOOK JUNKET.

19:50.583 --> 19:53.166
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
IT'S NOT TUMORS.

19:53.208 --> 19:55.041
NEUROCYSTICERCOSIS.

19:55.083 --> 19:57.959
PARASITES?
YES, PARASITES.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.750
I HAVE PARASITES IN MY BRAIN.

20:05.083 --> 20:08.208
OH, I FORGOT
WHAT IT WAS LIKE

20:08.250 --> 20:10.000
ON THIS SIDE OF THINGS--

20:10.041 --> 20:12.417
JUST BEING OUT HERE
IN THE WAITING ROOM.

20:12.458 --> 20:14.166
OH, HEY.

20:14.208 --> 20:17.875
BLOOD GAS TEST CONFIRMS IT.
THE MASS IS A PARASITIC CYST.
OH, MY GOD.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.542
I'M CALLING DEREK.
HE CAN TAKE THEM OUT.
IT MAY NOT BE A TUMOR,

20:20.583 --> 20:23.250
BUT IT'S STILL
IN MY THIRD VENTRICLE.

20:23.291 --> 20:26.083
THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THAT.
NO, YOU THOUGHT
YOU HAD FIVE YEARS.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.083
THESE LESIONS ARE WORM SACKS
IN YOUR BRAIN.

20:28.125 --> 20:30.208
THEY COULD BURST AT ANY MOMENT,
AND YOU COULD DIE.

20:30.250 --> 20:32.709
OR I COULD TAKE ANTIPARASITICS
AND STEROIDS TO KILL THEM.
(Sam) THEY MIGHT KILL 'EM.

20:32.750 --> 20:36.041
THEY COULD ALSO SEND YOUR
IMMUNE SYSTEM INTO OVERDRIVE.

20:36.083 --> 20:38.625
YOU END UP WITH BRAIN SWELLING,
MORE SEIZURES.
WHICH WOULD RUPTURE
THE REMAINING CYSTS.

20:38.667 --> 20:40.709
ARCHER, DO YOU REALIZE HOW LUCKY
YOU WERE LAST NIGHT THAT

20:40.750 --> 20:43.458
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN?
ON THE OTHER HAND,
THE DRUGS COULD CURE ME.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.458
ALL DUE RESPECT
TO YOUR EX-HUSBAND,

20:45.500 --> 20:47.917
EVEN IN DEREK'S HANDS, THERE'S
A 1-IN-4 CHANCE I'M A VEGETABLE.

20:47.959 --> 20:52.291
OR I COULD DIE ON THE TABLE OR I
COULD DIE FROM COMPLICATIONS.

20:52.333 --> 20:55.083
ARCHER--
YOU'RE A SURGEON. IT'S YOUR
INSTINCT TO CUT, NOT MINE.

20:55.125 --> 20:59.041
ADDISON, HE--HE HAS A RIGHT
TO MAKE HIS OWN DECISION.
WH--COME ON, NAI.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.917
WHAT, YOU'VE BEEN SLEEPING
WITH HIM FOR A FEW WEEKS,

21:01.959 --> 21:05.500
AND NOW YOU'RE ON HIS SIDE?
IT'S HIS FIELD
AND IT'S HIS LIFE.

21:05.542 --> 21:07.917
SAM?
IT'S RISKY, BUT--

21:07.959 --> 21:10.709
DRUGS CAN WORK.
I'M SORRY, ADDISON.

21:10.750 --> 21:13.625
DEREK MAY BE YOUR ANSWER,
BUT HE'S NOT MINE.

21:13.667 --> 21:16.166
THIS ISN'T YOUR CHOICE.

21:22.875 --> 21:25.500
HEY, UM, I DELIVERED
A BABY TODAY,

21:25.542 --> 21:27.959
AND--AND I-I THINK
I DID SOMETHING WRONG.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.500
AND, UH, Y-YOU WANT
TO TELL ME ABOUT IT?

21:30.542 --> 21:32.041
YEAH. I JUST... I...

21:32.083 --> 21:34.041
I PLACED THE VACUUM
TOO LOW, I THINK.

21:34.083 --> 21:36.542
I USED TOO MUCH FORCE,

21:36.583 --> 21:39.583
AND, UH, SHE'S GOT THIS...
LIKE, RED MARK.

21:39.625 --> 21:42.709
AND I'M AFRAID THERE MIGHT BE
BLEEDING IN THE BRAIN.

21:42.750 --> 21:44.750
WHAT DOES ADDISON SAY?
THAT SHE'S FINE.

21:44.792 --> 21:47.709
BUT SHE WON'T DO A C.T. SCAN
AND SHE WON'T CHECK,

21:47.750 --> 21:50.709
AND--AND NOW
SHE'S NOT EVEN HERE.
YOU ASKED FOR A DIAGNOSIS,
AND SHE GAVE IT.

21:50.750 --> 21:53.333
NOW SHE'S GOTTA FOCUS
ON HER BROTHER.
WHO IS GETTING EVERY TEST
UNDER THE SUN,

21:53.375 --> 21:55.333
WHICH IS GREAT, IT'S GREAT,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

21:55.375 --> 21:58.291
WHY CAN'T THE BABY
THAT I DELIVERED GET JUST ONE?

21:58.333 --> 22:00.041
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

22:00.083 --> 22:03.583
I THINK THAT YOU WANT HER TO RUN
A TEST TO TREAT YOUR ANXIETY

22:03.625 --> 22:05.417
AND NOT THE BABY.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.917

THE BABY IS HEALTHY,

22:07.959 --> 22:09.542
THEN ACCEPT IT.

22:09.583 --> 22:11.583
