00:03.378 --> 00:06.089
MASHA: Namaste.
Welcome to Tranquillum House.

00:06.882 --> 00:07.799
I'm Masha.

00:10.802 --> 00:13.055
‐ Are you saying
they don't want the book?

00:13.055 --> 00:15.015
TONY:
It's not normal to be screaming,

00:15.015 --> 00:17.392
"Dead to the fucking world"
at the top of your lungs.

00:17.392 --> 00:19.436
JESSICA: We're going
'cause we have issues, Benjamin.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.688
With us.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.273
TONY:
What are you in for?

00:23.273 --> 00:26.360
‐ Weight loss, esteem building,
mind and body transformation.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.986
‐ I mean, I already feel better.
I really do.

00:27.986 --> 00:29.613
Is this not fantastic?

00:29.613 --> 00:30.697
‐ What's that?

00:30.697 --> 00:31.907
DELILAH:
Blood draw. Standard practice.

00:31.907 --> 00:34.243
‐ Did she give you any idea
what to expect?

00:34.243 --> 00:35.953
FRANCES: Suffering.

00:53.512 --> 00:58.600
You've got this
strange effect on me

01:04.022 --> 01:09.069
strange effect on me

01:19.872 --> 01:25.502
oh, yes

01:25.502 --> 01:30.174
effect on me

02:25.646 --> 02:26.730
FRANCES: Hey, there.

02:27.648 --> 02:31.568
‐ Are you okay?

02:31.568 --> 02:33.904
‐ Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm fine.
I just, um...

02:35.447 --> 02:37.241
just a little panic attack.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.826
They come and go.
And sometimes

02:39.826 --> 02:41.995
I just feel like I'm gonna
freak out so I didn't want to,

02:42.996 --> 02:44.873
you know,
disrupt the session or anything.

02:44.873 --> 02:47.751
‐ Oh, well, that session is
officially disrupted, anyway.

02:47.751 --> 02:50.671
Your dad's back there
holding your mom back,

02:50.671 --> 02:52.548
I think she wants to, uh...

02:52.548 --> 02:54.007
...claw Masha's eyes out.

02:54.925 --> 02:57.010
Something about death,
or something,

02:57.010 --> 02:58.720
I didn't quite catch it.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.389
‐ Yeah, yeah, um,

03:00.389 --> 03:02.432
it's‐‐ it's my brother Zach.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.142
He‐‐ he stopped living
three years ago.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.479
Kind of why we're here.
Um...

03:07.479 --> 03:09.606
It would've been
his 21st birthday this week.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.317
Or our 21st.
We were‐‐ we were twins.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.237
But, uh, he...

03:15.237 --> 03:18.657
stopped living the day before
our 18th birthday. So...

03:18.657 --> 03:19.783
‐ Oh, God.

03:20.576 --> 03:23.662
‐ There you have it,
the Marconi family baggage,

03:23.662 --> 03:25.873
which was also searched,
by the way.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.166
Yes. Oh.

03:31.795 --> 03:32.963
‐ I'm sorry, honey.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.965
‐ It's okay.
We really weren't close.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.679
‐ Are you all right?
‐ Yeah, I'm fine.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.848
Just needed some air.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.185
‐ Hello.
‐ Hello.

03:47.477 --> 03:48.937
‐ Could I talk to my daughter...
‐ Yes.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.355
‐ ...please?
‐ Mom, Mom, it's fine.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.690
I'm fine. Frances, I'm fine.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.317
I was actually
just gonna go for a run.

03:53.317 --> 03:56.820
Um, I'll... see you.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.125
‐ She was telling me
about your son.

04:11.752 --> 04:12.669
‐ Oh.

04:13.921 --> 04:14.880
‐ I'm so sorry.

04:16.882 --> 04:17.883
‐ Thank you.

04:19.343 --> 04:20.719
TONY:
Yeah, I didn't read anything about

04:20.719 --> 04:22.471
getting my fucking bags gone through.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.931
Anybody else read
anything about that?

04:23.931 --> 04:25.349
'Cause I didn't read anything...
‐ Hey.

04:25.349 --> 04:27.434
‐ ...about that.
‐ Maybe you could take a breath.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.894
TONY: The fuck?

04:28.894 --> 04:30.896
I am not taking a breath.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.983
It's a fucking crime is what it is.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.444
Tossing our cells for contraband?

04:37.444 --> 04:39.446
Not giving our shit back,
that's a violation

04:39.446 --> 04:41.240
of our human rights, lady.

04:41.240 --> 04:44.201
Now, I've got prescription
medication in my wash bag

04:44.201 --> 04:46.620
and I'm gonna need it back,
like right‐fucking‐now.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.871
You feel me?

04:47.871 --> 04:50.374
‐ Yao. Would you go and retrieve
Tony's medicine?

04:50.374 --> 04:52.084
‐ Yeah, very good, thank you.

04:52.084 --> 04:54.002
MASHA: Would you like
your vodka as well?

04:54.002 --> 04:55.587
Or do you take it separately?

04:55.587 --> 04:56.713
‐ Fuck you.
‐ Hey, now.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.299
Let's just take it easy.
‐ Fuck you, too.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.677
JESSICA: Yeah, this is not
what I signed up for.

05:01.677 --> 05:03.345
Just like, FYI.
MASHA: We're okay.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.764
Part of the healing
is finding the wound.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.891
‐ That's why you picked us, right?

05:07.891 --> 05:09.268
‐ What do you mean, she “picked" us?

05:09.268 --> 05:13.105
‐ She accepts less than ten percent
of her applicants.

05:13.105 --> 05:14.773
We're just an equation.

05:14.773 --> 05:17.067
We complement
each other's demons.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.318
‐ What a fuckin' crock.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.696
‐ What is it
you look for in your guests?

05:20.696 --> 05:22.364
‐ Damage.
‐ Potential.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.741
FRANCES: Tomato, to‐mah‐toe.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.952
‐ Is that how
you're feeling about yourself,

05:26.952 --> 05:28.579
Frances? Is it?

05:29.913 --> 05:34.710
About things? About your life?
Tomato, to‐mah‐toe, whatever.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.587
‐ I know women like you.

05:36.587 --> 05:39.590
‐ You don't.
FRANCES: You're so driven.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.550
And you're so committed...

05:41.550 --> 05:44.678
to perfection that
you're not even human anymore.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.181
And you whittle
away everybody else

05:47.181 --> 05:49.099
so you don't have to see
your own bumps and bruises.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.395
Maybe some of these...
guests did come for struggle.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.355
But I get enough of
that in my day‐to‐day life.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.066
I didn't come here to open a vein.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.903
I came here to have
a little bit of fucking fun.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.573
‐ I'd like to talk to you in private,
if I may.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.702
Look, obviously,
you're a very smart person...

06:09.953 --> 06:11.038
building this whole...

06:13.832 --> 06:15.709
But uh,
it just doesn't make any sense.

06:16.251 --> 06:17.878
There's not a qualified
professional in the world

06:17.878 --> 06:19.922
who would confiscate
somebody's medication.

06:19.922 --> 06:21.798
‐ You're a drug addict, Tony.

06:21.798 --> 06:25.761
There's many places you could go
to detox or rehab.

06:25.761 --> 06:27.471
But you came here.

06:27.471 --> 06:28.889
Maybe to fix what caused

06:28.889 --> 06:30.349
you to become a drug addict.
‐ I know.

06:30.349 --> 06:31.850
I know what caused it, okay?

06:32.851 --> 06:34.770
Three spinal surgeries,
a blown knee.

06:34.770 --> 06:36.313
‐ That's just a story.

06:36.313 --> 06:40.150
One that's keeping you numb
and checked out of your entire life.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.152
‐ Okay. Yeah, day one
and you know all this, right?

06:43.612 --> 06:45.239
‐ You're divorced, yes?

06:46.532 --> 06:47.407
‐ Yeah.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.786
‐ You have, two children?

06:53.997 --> 06:55.832
How's your relationship with them?

06:59.503 --> 07:01.380
‐ This is it, right?
This is what you do?

07:03.757 --> 07:05.008
You get people to talk
about their shit,

07:05.008 --> 07:06.301
and then you use it against them.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.137
Huh? You gonna plug me
into an ATM machine now?

07:10.514 --> 07:12.224
‐ Are you happy with your life?

07:13.517 --> 07:16.103
‐ Am I happy with my life?

07:16.103 --> 07:17.563
‐ Mm‐hmm.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.607
‐ Who the fuck is happy
with their life?

07:33.954 --> 07:35.622
MASHA: Have it.

07:35.622 --> 07:36.623
Right now!

07:37.624 --> 07:39.168
And another one, in the morning.

07:39.168 --> 07:40.502
Every day.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.171
I don't want you sick, Tony.

07:43.922 --> 07:46.758
Hmm? I just want you...

07:47.551 --> 07:50.012
safe, healed.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.054
Whole.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.723
And I think
that's what you want.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.313
I never wanted
to take your pills, Tony.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.314
Just your secret.

08:32.763 --> 08:34.389
Oh, shit!
‐ I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:34.389 --> 08:35.849
‐ Jesus!
‐ I'm sorry.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.560
Oh, you scared me to death.
‐ I'm so sorry.

08:38.560 --> 08:41.188
‐ You shouldn't sneak up on people
in the dark like that.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.607
‐ I wasn't sneaking.
I just‐‐ You know, I read in the...

08:43.607 --> 08:47.402
in the... the pamphlet, uh, to be mindful

08:47.402 --> 08:50.030
of others that they might
be meditating and try not to...

08:50.030 --> 08:51.990
to disturb. So that's...
that's what that...

08:53.158 --> 08:54.993
Yeah.
‐ Well. I'm not meditating,

08:54.993 --> 08:57.829
just despondently staring
into the gaping void.

08:58.830 --> 09:03.043
‐ Hey, um... the... the... like,
welcoming thing, that was...

09:03.043 --> 09:04.086
‐ It was bat shit.
‐ Yeah.

09:04.086 --> 09:05.212
‐ Yeah.
‐ Okay, cool.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.339
'Cause I thought I was just
like losing my mind‐‐ okay.

09:07.339 --> 09:08.882
Hey, um,

09:09.716 --> 09:12.636
you probably don't want
to hear this.

09:12.636 --> 09:14.763
Uhm, you know, people come
to retreats to get away

09:14.763 --> 09:16.890
from it all and I have to say...

09:17.850 --> 09:19.810
I am such a huge fan.
‐ Oh.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.771
JESSICA: I've read
Nathaniel's Kiss like, three times.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.524
I think it's
the most romantic book...

09:25.524 --> 09:26.567
in the world.

09:29.111 --> 09:30.112
‐ Thank you for that.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.906
‐ So, what's, uh,
what's your crisis?

09:32.906 --> 09:34.032
‐ What's my what?

09:34.032 --> 09:36.660
‐ The British dude, he said that, uh,

09:36.660 --> 09:39.872
Masha like picked us all
for a particular crisis.

09:39.872 --> 09:42.624
With all your success, I just...
was wondering, I‐‐

09:44.376 --> 09:47.796
Now I'm realizing that...
I am kinda crossing a line.

09:47.796 --> 09:50.215
So, I'm gonna...
just gonna take it back.

09:50.215 --> 09:53.260
‐ It's okay, I... I'm just
here for a little R&R.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.888
Maybe, my crisis is
I don't have a crisis.

09:55.888 --> 09:58.265
‐ Mm‐hmm  Oh.

10:01.852 --> 10:04.271
‐ So are you writing anything new‐‐
‐ What's your crisis?

10:04.271 --> 10:07.900
‐ Oh, uh. Marriage counseling.
Yeah. Well, Ben and I just...

10:09.359 --> 10:11.612
a little bit of a bumpy patch.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.405
‐ I know that road.
JESSICA: Oh, you're married?

10:13.405 --> 10:17.910
Not currently.
Have been. Twice. Uh,

10:17.910 --> 10:21.330
optimist‐masochist. Fine line.

10:24.166 --> 10:28.921
That's my favorite part of, um,

10:29.630 --> 10:33.050
Nathaniel's Kiss.
You wrote, um, “He saw her.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.178
"And until then, she never knew.

10:37.179 --> 10:38.722
"She'd never been seen before.

10:40.015 --> 10:41.892
It was like coming home."

10:41.892 --> 10:44.102
It's a little clunky.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.438
‐ No. No, it's not.

10:46.438 --> 10:49.149
It's the most wonderful feeling
in the world.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.404
‐ You want
a little grown‐ass lady advice?

10:54.404 --> 10:56.114
You can take it or leave it?
‐ I'll take it.

10:57.950 --> 11:02.496
‐ I wouldn't look to novels,
or music, or movies,

11:02.496 --> 11:04.081
to tell you the truth about love.

11:05.123 --> 11:06.208
They lie.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.878
And we're just a pack of dirty liars.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.924
I mean, yeah.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.385
‐ Hustlers of the heart.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.345
‐ Did you just make that up?

11:18.345 --> 11:20.556
‐ I‐‐ Yeah, I guess I did.

11:20.556 --> 11:22.391
‐ God! You're good.
‐

11:24.852 --> 11:27.354
‐ I'm gonna... get back to‐‐

11:27.980 --> 11:29.815
Ye‐‐ um, thanks.

11:29.815 --> 11:31.692
I'll see you tomorrow, I guess?

11:31.692 --> 11:32.734
Maybe it won't be as...
‐ Weird?

11:32.734 --> 11:34.778
‐ Yeah. Let's hope.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.280
Good night.

11:36.280 --> 11:37.447
‐ Good night.

11:54.047 --> 11:58.260
‐ Hi, baby.
Let's have a quiet day today.

12:37.174 --> 12:39.134
NAPOLEON:
Oh, what shower pressure.

12:39.134 --> 12:40.802
Fantastic.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.638
I had a spectacular sleep.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.559
It's going to be
a fantastic day, I can feel it.

12:49.311 --> 12:51.313
You should shower if you're
going to do so before breakfast.

12:51.313 --> 12:53.398
They want us promptly
there at seven.

12:54.775 --> 12:58.695
I am absolutely famished,
by the way.

12:58.695 --> 13:02.199
Which I take as a good sign.
My metabolism is engaged

13:02.199 --> 13:03.242
and firing.

13:03.242 --> 13:07.162
‐ I think I might skip breakfast
and go for a run... instead.

13:07.162 --> 13:09.289
‐ Uh, I think brekkie is mandatory.

13:11.041 --> 13:14.461
It's a very precise regimen here.

13:14.461 --> 13:17.172
I suggest we surrender to it, pumpkin.

13:17.172 --> 13:20.592
‐ There's only so much
surrendering I can do, Leon.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.762
You go. Don't be late for breakfast.

13:25.347 --> 13:27.975
You certainly wouldn't want
to break a rule.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.434
‐ What's that supposed to mean?

13:30.811 --> 13:33.856
‐ Look, it means rules
are meant to be followed.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.774
How else to ensure

13:35.774 --> 13:38.277
the survival of a civilized society?

13:39.319 --> 13:41.572
‐ You have to seek out
the wonderful, Heather,

13:41.572 --> 13:43.448
because it doesn't
just come knocking.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.242
Maybe life will surprise you.

13:48.412 --> 13:51.623
‐ You know what you said to me?
Right after. Do you remember?

13:52.374 --> 13:55.210
You said, “Things happen for a reason."

13:58.213 --> 14:00.090
What...

14:00.924 --> 14:02.092
What reason?

14:03.844 --> 14:07.931
As much
as I love you, and I do, I do...

14:08.932 --> 14:11.351
‐ Finish it.
‐ I'm angry.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.020
NAPOLEON: At me?
‐ Yeah.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.189
For being so constantly upbeat.

14:16.231 --> 14:19.902
For trying to make sense of
of the most incomprehensible.

14:21.195 --> 14:23.780
But mostly,
for making me feel so alone.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.700
You make me feel so fucking alone.

14:28.744 --> 14:30.454
You ask, "Why are we here?"

14:31.288 --> 14:33.332
I'm here because I miss liking you.

14:47.971 --> 14:50.933
I know,
you didn't deserve that.

14:50.933 --> 14:55.521
‐ Hmm.
But I got it just the same.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.946
by Jimmie Davis playing

15:20.254 --> 15:25.551
I was mistaken

15:35.394 --> 15:38.730
when skies are grey

15:39.773 --> 15:44.278
how much I love you

15:45.988 --> 15:47.698
Yes!

15:58.333 --> 16:00.752
Hi, there, handsome.

16:00.752 --> 16:05.257
Hey, honey. I am unfortunately
gonna have to postpone my trip.

16:05.257 --> 16:07.342
I'm so sorry.

16:07.342 --> 16:09.845
‐ Oh, no. What happened?
‐ It's Ari.

16:09.845 --> 16:11.180
He was in a car accident.

16:11.180 --> 16:12.681
‐ Oh, my God. Is he okay?

16:12.681 --> 16:15.475
They put him into
an induced coma

16:15.475 --> 16:16.977
to help with his healing.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.937
I'm trying to get him
transferred to a better hospital...

16:18.937 --> 16:20.814
FRANCES: Here, you go detective,
you can keep it.

16:23.734 --> 16:26.236
I told him I loved him.

16:27.654 --> 16:32.784
He's an imaginary person
and I... I told him I loved him.

16:33.285 --> 16:36.830
MAN: This happens to a lot of women
of your age and circumstance.

16:44.213 --> 16:45.380
NAPOLEON: Good morning.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.466
‐ This should be on Instagram.

16:47.466 --> 16:48.884
BEN: Woo!

16:48.884 --> 16:53.013
‐ Oh, this is so adorable.
So healthy.

16:53.013 --> 16:55.849
‐ It... It's like a dream.
The perfect breakfast.

16:55.849 --> 16:59.061
‐ Yes, if you can't have substance,
style will do,

16:59.061 --> 17:00.312
I suppose.

17:00.312 --> 17:01.522
‐ How we doing, everybody?

17:01.522 --> 17:03.398
‐ I lost weight!

17:04.066 --> 17:05.776
‐ Y'know, I was meaning to say.

17:06.610 --> 17:09.363
BEN: Why you trying to lose weight?
You're not fat.

17:09.363 --> 17:11.740
‐ Thank you. But I'd...
I'd still like to be thinner.

17:11.740 --> 17:13.617
‐ But why? I don't get it.

17:14.660 --> 17:17.412
Why is everybody so obsessed
with that kind of thing?

17:17.412 --> 17:20.290
‐ I don't think we are, Ben.
And... If you're looking for

17:20.290 --> 17:22.668
commonality, I think we're
all obsessed with being a little

17:22.668 --> 17:25.796
better than we were yesterday.
A little less lousy,

17:25.796 --> 17:27.256
a little less in the toilet.

17:27.256 --> 17:30.092
I could be wrong, but isn't
that the essence of life?

17:30.968 --> 17:32.135
Identifying your hump

17:32.135 --> 17:34.763
and then hurling yourself over it.

17:35.556 --> 17:37.724
‐ Told you, she's, like, a gifted writer.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.434
‐ Good morning, good morning, everybody.

17:39.434 --> 17:42.020
What fell off the chuckwagon?
That's not me.

17:42.020 --> 17:44.731
Uh... hey, guys, look,
I know I came in a little rough

17:44.731 --> 17:47.693
to the dock yesterday
and I apologize, okay?

17:47.693 --> 17:49.194
And if I offended any of you

17:49.194 --> 17:53.657
and I probably offended most
of you, sorry. New day, huh?

17:53.657 --> 17:57.077
‐ Mm. Seems like someone
got his meds back.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.370
‐ You know what, Lars?

17:59.371 --> 18:00.497
I did.

18:01.623 --> 18:02.749
Thanks for caring.

18:05.836 --> 18:07.296
‐ Who are you, really?

18:08.297 --> 18:10.132
‐ You mean, like, deep down?

18:10.132 --> 18:13.260
‐ He does look familiar, right?
Like, I've seen your face.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.637
Probably on Dateline or something.

18:15.637 --> 18:16.847
DELILAH: People!

18:16.847 --> 18:19.766
All right!
Today's schedule.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.852
We will all begin
with a little dirt‐digging.

18:21.852 --> 18:22.853
In the afternoon‐‐

18:22.853 --> 18:24.021
‐ What do you mean, dirt‐digging?

18:24.021 --> 18:26.356
‐ Soil bacteria has special qualities.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.650
It can fight anxiety,
depression, maybe even cancer.

18:29.026 --> 18:33.155
‐ I'm not... I'm not that big
on dirt or bacteria.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.240
It's kind of a Protestant thing.
I don't wanna talk about it.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.242
TONY: You got an excuse for everything.
‐ Hmm?

18:37.242 --> 18:38.785
‐ I said, you got an excuse‐‐
‐ No! Still can't hear,

18:38.785 --> 18:39.745
your mouths is...
DELILAH: Okay.

18:39.745 --> 18:41.455
‐ I get it.
DELILAH: Team...

18:41.455 --> 18:43.582
‐ Yeah, this is definitely not a team.

18:43.582 --> 18:45.918
I mean, this is like
the opposite of a team.

19:16.865 --> 19:18.867
Something you need?

19:20.786 --> 19:23.080
‐ Tell me, you pool sit
when you're stressed.

19:23.080 --> 19:26.500
And you've been down here
every day of late. What's wrong?

19:29.294 --> 19:31.547
‐ I received some disturbing messages.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.302
Threats.
‐ Threats from who?

19:38.095 --> 19:39.388
‐ Anonymous.

19:40.389 --> 19:41.557
‐ Should we report it?

19:42.683 --> 19:45.310
‐ To who? The police?
What are they gonna do?

19:47.563 --> 19:48.772
It could be from anyone.

19:50.148 --> 19:53.235
I wasn't a very nice person
in my previous life.

19:54.278 --> 19:56.655
You would've shot me too
if you'd known me then.

19:56.655 --> 19:59.491
‐ No. No, I wouldn't have.

20:00.701 --> 20:02.786
‐ No. You wouldn't have.

20:06.957 --> 20:08.792
You and Delilah okay?

20:11.712 --> 20:13.297
‐ She still gets a little jealous.

20:13.964 --> 20:16.300
‐ She'll have to get over
that, won't she?

20:16.300 --> 20:17.176
Hmm?

20:18.218 --> 20:19.261
‐ It's difficult.

20:19.928 --> 20:22.598
‐ That's what life is more
than anything, difficult.

20:24.892 --> 20:26.185
Hmm.

20:26.852 --> 20:30.189
We are and we always will be

20:30.731 --> 20:34.151
profoundly and inextricably bound.

20:36.862 --> 20:37.988
Don't you agree?

20:44.119 --> 20:46.580
Love her.
And she will feel loved.

20:58.800 --> 21:02.221
Fuck!
That's it, I'm done.

21:02.221 --> 21:04.723
‐ Digging graves is not doing
my back any favors.

21:04.723 --> 21:07.267
‐ What are you talking about?
They dug half of it for us

21:07.267 --> 21:09.019
and you haven't
even stood up, yet.

21:09.019 --> 21:11.188
‐ I am still helping
and exerting myself.

21:11.188 --> 21:13.315
Not that I've asked for your opinion.

21:14.650 --> 21:16.985
‐ It feels good, doesn't it?

21:16.985 --> 21:20.155
To exhaust the body
with hard, hard work.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.450
Pre‐industrial man,
he didn't get depressed

21:23.450 --> 21:26.203
because he
was too busy working.

21:26.203 --> 21:30.666
Would you please lie down
in your ditches?

21:30.666 --> 21:33.168
‐ Uh...

21:44.429 --> 21:47.349
‐ We spend our lives avoiding
the thought of

21:47.349 --> 21:50.143
the one true guarantee.

21:50.143 --> 21:54.147
That our time here is limited.

21:54.147 --> 21:56.149
We are terrified of death,

21:56.149 --> 21:59.444
not because it is unknown,
but because it forces us

21:59.444 --> 22:01.697
to confront
our deepest regrets.

22:02.990 --> 22:04.199
Be it...

22:05.951 --> 22:07.995
lies we have told...

22:09.997 --> 22:11.540
people we have hurt...

22:13.375 --> 22:15.627
professional failures or...

22:16.420 --> 22:17.462
or simply...

22:19.256 --> 22:21.258
an unfulfilled life.

22:22.384 --> 22:25.053
So, I want you all now
to close your eyes.

22:26.221 --> 22:28.265
Think of your life, past.

22:30.851 --> 22:32.936
Imagine that your body,

22:32.936 --> 22:35.731
has returned to the Mother Earth,

22:35.731 --> 22:38.150
and that your soul
has been set free.

22:38.150 --> 22:40.068
And your loved ones...

22:41.945 --> 22:44.072
your loved ones
are gathered around you.

22:44.656 --> 22:46.366
‐ Marconis, we okay with this?

22:49.119 --> 22:50.412
‐ Yeah. You good, Mom?

22:51.330 --> 22:52.623
‐ I'm fine.

22:54.333 --> 22:57.753
‐ Now, think of all the things
that matter to you.

22:57.753 --> 22:59.796
The events that pre‐occupy you.

22:59.796 --> 23:03.509
Everything that you're obsessed about.
That you're worried about,

23:03.509 --> 23:06.261
that is stopping you from having a full

23:06.261 --> 23:09.556
and extraordinary, exceptional life.

23:11.642 --> 23:14.102
Think of the relationships
that matter to you.

23:15.145 --> 23:18.398
The people who will mourn you.

23:21.109 --> 23:23.237
What do you want them
to say about your life?

23:24.863 --> 23:27.324
Now... that it is over?

23:28.992 --> 23:31.662
‐ You know,
this exercise is ridiculous.

23:31.662 --> 23:34.414
‐ Just lie down, Frances.
Contemplate.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.625
‐ What is it gonna take?
What do I have to say

23:36.625 --> 23:38.001
to get out of the dirt hole?

23:38.001 --> 23:39.461
You wanna hear that if I die today,

23:39.461 --> 23:40.754
nobody would care? Fine.

23:40.754 --> 23:43.048
Because if I did die today,
nobody would care.

23:43.715 --> 23:46.051
Because I'm humiliated
and I am alone

23:46.051 --> 23:47.761
and it's only gonna get worse.

23:47.761 --> 23:50.222
And you'll love this.
I pre‐paid my own funeral.

23:50.222 --> 23:52.432
Because nobody else
is gonna do it, okay?

23:52.432 --> 23:55.143
Is that enough? Does that count?
Can we stop now?

23:55.644 --> 23:57.646
‐ Frances, this isn't just about you.

24:00.816 --> 24:02.568
You now have the chance...

24:04.236 --> 24:05.654
and you have the choice...

24:06.822 --> 24:09.157
to come back and reinvent yourself.

24:10.242 --> 24:12.369
When you hear
the sound of the chimes,

24:12.369 --> 24:13.912
I invite you...

24:15.038 --> 24:16.915
to rebirth yourself...

24:17.749 --> 24:21.128
out of the Earth
and into your new life.

24:42.441 --> 24:45.235
‐ That was interesting.
‐ Could you just be open, please?

24:46.945 --> 24:48.030
‐ Okay.

24:48.697 --> 24:51.783
YAO: All right! Next up
is the hike this afternoon.

24:51.783 --> 24:53.827
‐ Yeah, I... I don't think
I'm up for a hike.

24:54.453 --> 24:56.914
‐ Of course. It's not mandatory,
though highly recommended.

24:56.914 --> 24:58.624
We can schedule you
for some acupuncture,

24:58.624 --> 25:00.959
maybe, it'll help with your back.
‐ Oh, that would be lovely.

25:00.959 --> 25:03.086
‐ Jessica, your session
with Masha is now.

25:03.086 --> 25:06.340
‐ Is that mandatory?
YAO: Yes. Yes, it is.

25:15.307 --> 25:17.226
This is absolutely incredible.

25:17.226 --> 25:21.480
You know, I toured
the Acupuncture Houses, uh, in Beijing.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.607
I was doing some research
for one of my books.

25:23.607 --> 25:26.109
But have you been?
‐ Oh, Lulu's been everywhere.

25:26.109 --> 25:27.945
‐ Oh.
‐ I trained in Oregon.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.284
Oh.

25:35.202 --> 25:36.995
The Bai Hui point.

25:36.995 --> 25:38.413
It's where all energies converge.

25:38.413 --> 25:39.748
Is that right?
‐ That's right.

25:39.748 --> 25:41.959
Try to keep still, Frances.

25:43.669 --> 25:45.754
‐ Oh. I felt that.

25:45.754 --> 25:47.297
‐ Yeah, I'm just taking some blood.

25:47.297 --> 25:48.841
‐ Oh. Why?

25:48.841 --> 25:50.425
‐ For your blood sugar.

25:50.425 --> 25:51.969
‐ Ah. Okay.
Well, next time maybe

25:51.969 --> 25:54.054
give me a heads‐up
before you shiv my lipids.

25:54.054 --> 25:56.181
‐ Okay, good one.

25:56.181 --> 25:58.350
You're funny. I like you.

25:58.350 --> 26:00.936
‐ Well... that makes
one of us.

26:02.396 --> 26:04.273
Can I ask you two a question?

26:04.273 --> 26:05.816
GLORY: Mm‐hmm, of course.

26:05.816 --> 26:09.027
‐ I mean, is Masha crazy
or is she the real deal?

26:09.027 --> 26:10.946
GLORY: Masha?

26:13.407 --> 26:16.034
Masha is the realest of them all.
Hundred percent.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.498
‐ Why are you here?

26:21.498 --> 26:24.084
‐ Oh, I thought we had
our one‐on‐one, but I can come‐‐

26:24.084 --> 26:27.713
‐ Oh, no.
Why are you at Tranquillum?

26:29.381 --> 26:30.674
‐ What are you hoping to gain?

26:31.633 --> 26:32.843
‐ Um...

26:34.595 --> 26:36.889
Transformation, for one thing.

26:38.140 --> 26:41.643
I'm really... interested
in fixing what's broken,

26:42.352 --> 26:44.354
you know?
‐ And what would that be?

26:46.231 --> 26:48.275
Uh...

26:51.195 --> 26:52.738
‐ You are very nervous.

26:52.738 --> 26:54.823
Yeah, I am.

26:55.407 --> 26:56.950
‐ There is no reason to be.

27:00.287 --> 27:01.496
Tell me.

27:03.415 --> 27:07.252
What is particularly making
you anxious right now?

27:09.087 --> 27:10.380
‐ You.

27:13.091 --> 27:14.927
You're, like, super smart

27:15.802 --> 27:16.845
and intuitive.

27:18.096 --> 27:19.640
And very fucking hot, by the way.

27:19.640 --> 27:21.266
I'm sorry, but you are, and I'm, uh...

27:27.564 --> 27:29.066
And I'm okay
with people looking at me

27:29.066 --> 27:31.193
on the outside,
you know, I've basically

27:31.193 --> 27:32.986
cultivated that but,

27:32.986 --> 27:35.656
being seen on the inside, which...

27:35.656 --> 27:38.784
you strike me as very...
capable of, um,

27:38.784 --> 27:40.452
it just makes me...
MASHA: You came here afraid.

27:42.704 --> 27:45.958
You were afraid before
you knew of my existence.

27:50.337 --> 27:51.964
‐ When I was, uh...

27:52.798 --> 27:53.924
lying in that ditch,

27:54.675 --> 27:55.843
you know, um,

27:56.802 --> 27:58.220
imagining my own death,

27:59.096 --> 28:00.722
I thought about comments.

28:03.600 --> 28:04.810
Not my family.

28:06.645 --> 28:07.688
Comments.

28:09.022 --> 28:11.567
Saying how tragic it was
that someone so...

28:13.068 --> 28:14.361
young and...

28:16.613 --> 28:17.614
pretty...

28:18.323 --> 28:19.408
died like that.

28:20.492 --> 28:22.828
And for a second,
it made me feel better.

28:23.871 --> 28:24.913
For a second.

28:24.913 --> 28:26.248
Then I realized

28:26.832 --> 28:29.376
my Instagram account
would be deleted a week later

28:29.376 --> 28:34.506
and everyone would move on,
forget about me.

28:34.506 --> 28:38.343
‐ You want your life...
to be important,

28:38.343 --> 28:39.636
to mean something.

28:39.636 --> 28:41.013
‐ Yeah.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.558
‐ But that's not
what you really came here for.

28:45.767 --> 28:46.977
‐ Um, it's not?

28:50.898 --> 28:52.691
‐ Why doesn't he love you anymore?

28:57.196 --> 28:58.655
I don't know.

29:00.949 --> 29:02.201
‐ It's unfair.

29:04.620 --> 29:05.704
Mm‐hmm.

29:35.192 --> 29:36.401
TONY: Attractive.

29:38.403 --> 29:41.698
‐ If you don't mind,
I'm social distancing.

29:41.698 --> 29:43.200
‐ Actually, I do mind.

29:43.200 --> 29:46.328
‐ Well, then fine.
I have my cramps.

29:46.328 --> 29:48.497
‐ You can't have both cramps
and hot flashes...

29:48.497 --> 29:50.040
I don't think.

29:50.541 --> 29:52.835
‐ For you, I can. So bye‐bye.

29:54.545 --> 29:56.713
‐ You know what, lady?
‐  Here we go.

29:56.713 --> 29:58.674
‐ One of the reasons I came
to this funny farm,

29:59.842 --> 30:01.510
my entire adult life
people have been telling me

30:01.510 --> 30:03.011
to fuck off.

30:03.011 --> 30:04.638
‐ Well...
TONY: And in the very short time

30:04.638 --> 30:06.098
that we've known each other,

30:06.098 --> 30:07.766
you've practically medaled at it.

30:08.684 --> 30:10.769
You know what,
I'm not fucking off.

30:10.769 --> 30:13.230
All right?
This place practically screams,

30:13.230 --> 30:14.773
"welcome mat."

30:14.773 --> 30:16.400
I'm going to enjoy the nature.

30:17.317 --> 30:20.946
I'm going to enjoy the food.
I'm gonna enjoy the... pool.

30:20.946 --> 30:21.989
I'm even gonna enjoy you

30:21.989 --> 30:23.907
bobbing up and down
like a cork in the pool.

30:23.907 --> 30:26.159
You know why?
Because every day is a gift.

30:27.160 --> 30:29.997
This whole place
is my fucking gift, lady.

30:30.998 --> 30:33.542
‐ Did I hear something?
I could have... I...

30:34.126 --> 30:36.336
I just thought...
Did anyone say something?

30:36.336 --> 30:40.757
I don't see anybody. No. Nobody.

30:40.757 --> 30:43.051
Nobody. Nobody.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.018
Son of a...

30:54.396 --> 30:56.773
You bastard!

30:57.566 --> 31:00.736
‐ I'm sorry, what did you say?
‐  Ugh!

31:01.445 --> 31:04.156
‐ Okay, let's take this to
a higher plane, shall we?

31:04.156 --> 31:05.741
You're gonna start
with your hands out

31:05.741 --> 31:08.368
in front or behind you.
Eyes on the ground.

31:08.368 --> 31:10.746
Six to eight feet in front of you.

31:10.746 --> 31:13.415
We're gonna start with your right foot,
move it forward one step.

31:14.499 --> 31:17.836
Think right step, left step...

31:17.836 --> 31:20.714
‐ Right. Left. Right.

31:21.757 --> 31:22.966
‐ So how did it go?

31:22.966 --> 31:26.053
‐ Yeah, oh, uh...
‐ Wait, was she amazing?

31:27.346 --> 31:29.139
‐ I think both of
y'all are a little star‐struck.

31:29.139 --> 31:33.143
‐ Oh, no. I'm... I'm actually,
not a star‐struck person.

31:33.143 --> 31:35.437
I used to work on Broadway,
so I've met stars,

31:35.437 --> 31:36.897
real stars.

31:36.897 --> 31:38.941
I met Alan Cumming.

31:38.941 --> 31:40.776
So, I'm not star‐struck.

31:40.776 --> 31:43.529
‐ Wow, Broadway.
What'd you do on Broadway?

31:43.529 --> 31:46.281
‐ Oh, I did, um... wardrobe, um,

31:46.281 --> 31:48.242
hair and make‐up, props.
I kinda actually...

31:48.242 --> 31:49.243
I did it all.

31:49.952 --> 31:51.370
Yeah, till I had my girls.

31:51.370 --> 31:52.496
And my husband,
he didn't want me to

31:52.496 --> 31:54.581
work anymore.
He made enough money...

31:55.582 --> 31:57.709
so, you know, he just...
he didn't like the idea

31:57.709 --> 31:59.002
of a nanny raising our kids.

31:59.962 --> 32:02.464
‐ That's nice. At least you had
that time with your kids.

32:04.091 --> 32:05.300
‐ What did you say?

32:06.093 --> 32:07.094
‐ Huh?

32:07.094 --> 32:09.096
CARMEL: Well, they're still my kids.

32:09.096 --> 32:12.015
Just because they're off
with someone else, they're still...

32:12.015 --> 32:13.267
they're still my kids.

32:14.810 --> 32:15.936
BEN: What did I say?

32:15.936 --> 32:20.065
‐ You... you said, had,
past tense. But...

32:21.066 --> 32:25.487
‐ Seems like she... had a past
and now it's tense.

32:25.946 --> 32:28.073
‐ Is that really something
to be proud of?

32:28.949 --> 32:30.200
These bloody breeders.

32:31.535 --> 32:34.121
Biggest threat to the planet
is overpopulation and they keep

32:34.121 --> 32:35.622
pumping them out without an apology.

32:36.748 --> 32:38.458
‐ It's incredible you're still single.

32:39.710 --> 32:41.170
Crazy.

32:41.170 --> 32:42.379
Whatever.

33:09.114 --> 33:14.286
beneath the stars above

33:27.674 --> 33:30.427
‐ Are you fucking kidding me? Are you‐‐

33:33.597 --> 33:36.183
‐ Hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no. Come here.

33:36.183 --> 33:41.021
Hey!

33:41.021 --> 33:43.565
You all right? Hey?

33:43.565 --> 33:46.527
You okay?
‐ I don't know I...

33:46.527 --> 33:50.906
‐ Just take deep breaths.
Deep breaths. In and...

33:50.906 --> 33:52.866
Oh, good.
‐  Oh God!

33:52.866 --> 33:55.160
‐ Oh.
‐ What happened?

33:55.160 --> 33:58.622
‐ I don't know. Ah... you... you
were sleeping, you were snoring

33:58.622 --> 34:00.916
and then all of a sudden, you...
you were choking. It was...

34:00.916 --> 34:02.042
so weird.

34:03.043 --> 34:04.795
I don't
understand how you just...

34:04.795 --> 34:07.506
...just start choking.

34:07.506 --> 34:09.007
‐ I don't know.
Do you have a medical condition?

34:09.007 --> 34:10.467
‐ No.

34:10.467 --> 34:12.094
Not that I know of, I don't...

34:13.178 --> 34:16.014
‐ Oh, that was scary.
‐  Oh, what is that?

34:16.807 --> 34:18.267
‐ What?

34:18.267 --> 34:20.853
‐ Is that a grape?
‐ No. No, I don't...

34:20.853 --> 34:22.104
‐ Is that...

34:22.104 --> 34:23.814
Don't! What are you doing?
‐ I don't... I don't think so.

34:23.814 --> 34:25.607
FRANCES: Keep... Damn it.

34:27.609 --> 34:29.361
It is a grape.
‐ Huh.

34:31.864 --> 34:33.574
How did it a grape get in my...

34:33.574 --> 34:35.492
‐ I don't know. Yeah.

34:38.912 --> 34:44.084
Oh. Did you put
a grape into my mouth?

34:44.084 --> 34:45.335
‐ No. What are you...
‐ Oh, my God!

34:45.335 --> 34:47.087
‐ I... No...

34:47.087 --> 34:48.297
‐ Did you throw a grape into mouth?

34:48.297 --> 34:50.132
‐ I know, I tossed the grape
in your mouth

34:50.132 --> 34:52.509
but it was an accident, okay?
You were snoring and I just...

34:52.509 --> 34:53.802
you know, I just wanted
to wake you up.

34:53.802 --> 34:55.762
And...

34:55.762 --> 34:57.639
I'm sorry.
‐ You could've killed me.

34:57.639 --> 34:59.308
‐ I could take that shot all day long

34:59.308 --> 35:01.518
and the odds of it going in are like...

35:02.853 --> 35:05.105
Do you want a grape?
‐ What?

35:08.442 --> 35:10.694
I do not want a grape.
I'm not gonna...

35:11.570 --> 35:12.988
Don't you...

35:18.535 --> 35:20.162
How do you like it?

35:24.833 --> 35:25.959
TONY: Who's Paul?

35:26.919 --> 35:28.504
FRANCES: Who's what?

35:28.504 --> 35:33.717
‐ Paul. You were...
You were saying his name, Paul,

35:33.717 --> 35:35.761
when you were sleeping.
‐ No, I wasn't.

35:37.054 --> 35:39.890
‐ Yes, you were.
‐ No, I wasn't.

35:41.683 --> 35:45.062
Got it.

35:48.440 --> 35:49.525
So who is he?

35:53.904 --> 35:55.989
‐ I don't know.
I can honestly say,

35:55.989 --> 35:58.867
I don't know who Paul is,
but I do know

35:58.867 --> 36:00.577
that it's none of your business.

36:02.120 --> 36:03.705
‐ Well, which is it?

36:11.171 --> 36:12.798
‐ Paul Drabble. Uh...

36:13.507 --> 36:14.508
Is a man I met...

36:15.300 --> 36:17.803
online, a man I fell in love with online.

36:19.429 --> 36:22.724
A man who did not fall in love
with me,

36:22.724 --> 36:24.560
either online or offline.

36:25.435 --> 36:26.770
Allegedly from...

36:28.272 --> 36:31.525
Canada, who had a fake child,

36:32.359 --> 36:34.278
that got a fake illness...

36:35.571 --> 36:37.114
and then he convinced me to...

36:37.948 --> 36:40.742
send him...
quite a bit of real money.

36:41.827 --> 36:43.370
Oh, I'm sorry.

36:43.370 --> 36:45.122
‐ I mean, you know, it's not like

36:45.122 --> 36:47.791
I had to date online.
I get asked out by men...

36:48.417 --> 36:51.086
all the time.
There's multiple sources that say

36:51.086 --> 36:53.839
I'm‐‐ I'm very good in bed,
even enthusiastic.

36:53.839 --> 36:55.215
‐ Well, you don't have
to talk about this

36:55.215 --> 36:56.800
if it makes you
feel uncomfortable.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.385
‐ Doesn't make me uncomfortable.
Does it make you uncomfortable?

36:58.385 --> 36:59.428
‐ Yeah, a little.

37:03.348 --> 37:06.059
‐ There's a part of me
that thinks it was worth it.

37:07.561 --> 37:11.023
You know, six months of love
and... companionship.

37:11.732 --> 37:14.067
I don't know, half a year of
that, feeling like that...

37:16.320 --> 37:17.696
Not a bad deal. Right?

37:22.075 --> 37:23.702
‐ Maybe you could put
it in one of your books.

37:24.745 --> 37:26.496
It'll make a good story, no?

37:26.496 --> 37:27.956
‐ Yeah, maybe.

37:29.833 --> 37:31.210
I take it you've never read me.

37:32.336 --> 37:34.254
‐ Well, uh, yeah. You know what?

37:34.254 --> 37:35.547
I read a snippet.

37:35.547 --> 37:37.132
Snippet.
‐ Yesterday.

37:38.342 --> 37:40.761
When I was taking
a piss on this massive tree,

37:40.761 --> 37:43.430
found an article
all about your Beating Heart.

37:44.264 --> 37:45.474
‐ Wait, what?

37:46.141 --> 37:47.601
‐ Isn't that what it's called?
The Beating...

37:47.601 --> 37:48.685
The Beating Heart?
‐ No!

37:49.436 --> 37:50.812
‐ It was.
‐ No.

37:50.812 --> 37:52.814
‐ The... That's what they said.
‐ No, it's not.

37:53.649 --> 37:55.734
It can't...
No, because it can't be

37:55.734 --> 37:56.902
because it's not...

37:58.028 --> 37:59.196
It's not published yet.

37:59.196 --> 38:00.864
And so it's still
in manuscript format.

38:00.864 --> 38:02.324
I don't know what to tell you.

38:02.324 --> 38:04.785
Maybe the guy got
a leaked copy or something.

38:06.370 --> 38:07.621
I'd be stoked, actually.

38:07.621 --> 38:08.997
It means he really wanted
to read it, right?

38:08.997 --> 38:10.499
You're in demand.

38:10.499 --> 38:11.750
I would take it as a compliment.

38:11.750 --> 38:14.086
‐ What did it say?
‐ I don't... I don't remember.

38:14.086 --> 38:15.838
‐ Just what‐‐ You‐‐
I know you're lying.

38:15.838 --> 38:17.005
What did it say?

38:19.299 --> 38:20.634
‐ He didn't like it very much.

38:22.135 --> 38:23.887
‐ He‐‐ He didn't like‐‐
Did he hate it?

38:23.887 --> 38:25.430
‐ What do critics know anyway, huh?

38:26.139 --> 38:27.391
Look at poor Stallone.

38:27.391 --> 38:29.768
Ah, the fucking critics
treat him like garbage

38:29.768 --> 38:31.603
and Rocky is the greatest movie
ever made.

38:37.526 --> 38:39.152
‐ So they hated it.

38:43.198 --> 38:44.908
Well. That's that.

38:50.205 --> 38:51.623
‐ Where are you going?

38:57.296 --> 38:59.548
GLORY: Implicitly,
it may seem like a kids' game.

38:59.548 --> 39:02.009
But when it comes to trusting,

39:02.009 --> 39:03.510
when it comes
to being ourselves,

39:03.510 --> 39:04.803
when it comes to letting go,

39:06.388 --> 39:07.931
kids have a lot to teach us.

39:08.390 --> 39:09.308
NAPOLEON: That's right.

39:10.017 --> 39:10.934
GLORY: Let's give it a go.

39:14.479 --> 39:15.606
NAPOLEON:
Okay, come on, Carmel.

39:18.692 --> 39:21.069
Okay, you ready? Here we go...

39:21.069 --> 39:22.738
All right.
Come on, Carmel.

39:22.738 --> 39:25.240
Oh, my God!

39:25.240 --> 39:28.619
NAPOLEON: Oh, wow, you got me.

39:29.453 --> 39:31.371
CARMEL: Got you!

39:56.396 --> 39:58.690
‐ All right,
I wanna do him next.

40:00.192 --> 40:01.151
‐ Mom.

40:03.111 --> 40:04.905
Mom!
‐ Honey!

40:04.905 --> 40:05.906
Honey!

40:09.368 --> 40:10.661
HEATHER:
Take your hands off me.

40:11.620 --> 40:13.121
Just take
your fucking hands off me!

40:13.121 --> 40:14.790
NAPOLEON: Please, honey. Please.

40:14.790 --> 40:18.460
‐ Napoleon, please step back.
It's okay.

40:20.629 --> 40:21.922
It's okay!

40:29.054 --> 40:31.056
Heather, what's going on?

40:31.056 --> 40:32.850
‐ I just want you to step away.

40:32.850 --> 40:36.311
‐ I'm not gonna do that.
But what I am gonna do,

40:36.311 --> 40:38.313
is hold your hand.

40:51.118 --> 40:53.078
Do you know what
they say about holding hands?

40:53.078 --> 40:56.164
It's intimate.

40:56.164 --> 40:59.001
It can be more intimate
than lovemaking even.

40:59.001 --> 41:00.627
Do you know why?

41:01.503 --> 41:03.380
There's something intuitive about it,

41:03.380 --> 41:05.924
something knowing about it.

41:07.342 --> 41:10.220
Perhaps, it's... it's
the nerve endings in the

41:10.220 --> 41:13.265
fingertips or the sensory
systems in the hands,

41:13.265 --> 41:15.726
but people feel each other.

41:15.726 --> 41:17.019
They know each other,

41:17.019 --> 41:18.979
even people they've never
even met before.

41:23.817 --> 41:26.904
What do you feel
in my hands, Heather?

41:28.447 --> 41:31.658
Somebody who's been where...
where you are, maybe?

41:33.493 --> 41:36.246
Somebody who has stood
where you stand?

41:41.960 --> 41:44.171
‐ You have never stood where I stand.

42:05.734 --> 42:07.236
YAO: Do you think she
was really going to jump?

42:07.236 --> 42:09.488
DELILAH: I don't know.
Maybe not today,

42:09.488 --> 42:11.532
but she's certainly ideating.

42:11.532 --> 42:13.534
This group is
a powder keg, Masha.

42:14.868 --> 42:17.829
Lars is... Honestly,
I... I don't know what Lars is,

42:17.829 --> 42:20.290
but I know, he's not just
a guest.

42:20.290 --> 42:22.835
He‐he's... got some agenda.
I can smell it.

42:22.835 --> 42:24.878
‐ You swept his room?

42:24.878 --> 42:26.672
DELILAH: Top to bottom.

42:29.716 --> 42:31.760
‐ Yao, would you sweep
it again for me?

42:31.760 --> 42:33.011
YAO: No problem.

42:34.263 --> 42:36.306
‐ Oh. I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you were

42:38.475 --> 42:41.353
‐ No. It's quite all right.
Please.

42:45.148 --> 42:46.191
Come on in.

42:50.237 --> 42:51.613
How can I help you?

42:51.613 --> 42:55.492
I think...
I think I have to go.

42:57.369 --> 42:58.453
I don't...

42:58.453 --> 43:00.664
want to find myself.
I don't...

43:00.664 --> 43:03.166
think I'm equipped for
the discovery.

43:03.166 --> 43:05.836
I just had kind of
a near‐death experience myself,

43:05.836 --> 43:08.297
so... guess that's one thing
we have in common, huh?

43:09.047 --> 43:11.300
Mine wasn't as exotic as yours, but...

43:12.092 --> 43:14.303
First, because I almost
choked on a grape.

43:14.845 --> 43:17.472
And, uh... second,
I didn't... I didn't...

43:18.348 --> 43:22.436
I didn't see the little girl,
joyously riding her bike.

43:22.436 --> 43:23.478
I just...

43:24.563 --> 43:25.689
I just saw the truth.

43:26.231 --> 43:27.357
‐ Which is...

43:29.276 --> 43:31.695
How much time do you got?

43:31.695 --> 43:33.655
Sit.

43:35.365 --> 43:36.658
Frances.

43:44.541 --> 43:45.626
What?

43:45.626 --> 43:50.547
‐ The... truth is that I'm a...
twice‐divorced, middle‐aged...

43:51.840 --> 43:56.094
hot‐flashing, menopausal heap.
I've become a punchline.

43:57.513 --> 44:00.307
I have been down
in these dark holes before.

44:00.307 --> 44:03.560
And... the one way out was
that I could write my way out.

44:04.853 --> 44:07.606
I'm a one‐trick pony

44:07.606 --> 44:09.942
that can no longer do her one trick.

44:11.860 --> 44:14.029
‐ You're a car, Frances.

44:14.029 --> 44:15.739
‐ Oh, okay. A... a car?

44:15.739 --> 44:18.450
‐ Hm. And your gas tank is empty.

44:18.450 --> 44:19.868
And you're smoking,

44:19.868 --> 44:21.954
you're churning,
you're wheezing.

44:22.871 --> 44:25.832
You can't get going. But...

44:26.416 --> 44:29.211
in a few days,
you're gonna refuel.

44:30.337 --> 44:32.965
And I promise you, you're gonna
feel a thousand times better.

44:34.174 --> 44:36.093
‐ I totally expected
a metaphor there.

44:36.093 --> 44:37.219
I just thought...

44:38.470 --> 44:40.556
maybe it would be
something a little more

44:40.556 --> 44:44.518
lyrical.
‐ Okay. Try this.

44:47.938 --> 44:49.314
Kintsugi.

44:50.691 --> 44:54.695
‐ No. The Japanese art
of repairing broken pottery.

44:55.612 --> 44:58.657
The broken pieces are mended
with lacquer,

44:58.657 --> 45:01.201
powdered gold to make
something stronger.

45:02.870 --> 45:04.288
More beautiful.

45:05.914 --> 45:07.624
‐ Does beat a crappy car.

45:08.667 --> 45:09.877
‐ This will be you.

45:14.965 --> 45:19.636
‐ I just, uh...
I don't think I want it.

45:21.263 --> 45:22.681
‐ It's what you need.

45:26.560 --> 45:29.563
I... I think
I may need a Four Seasons

45:29.563 --> 45:32.399
and a couple of bellinis,
is what I need.

45:32.399 --> 45:34.693
Frances, give me one more day.

45:34.693 --> 45:35.903
Please.

45:36.862 --> 45:37.821
One more day.

45:38.530 --> 45:42.075
If tomorrow you... you...
you don't wanna stay, fine.

45:42.075 --> 45:45.204
I'll respect your decision.
But give me one more day. Yes?

45:46.288 --> 45:48.290
‐ I don't think anything
is gonna change.

45:49.291 --> 45:51.168
‐ What have you got to lose?
You've come this far.

45:55.797 --> 45:57.132
‐ Okay.

45:58.884 --> 46:02.387
Just no more metaphors.
Like I can take it.

46:17.027 --> 46:21.782
through and through

46:23.158 --> 46:27.204
we shouldn't do

46:46.265 --> 46:50.018
we shouldn't do

46:50.018 --> 46:53.105
Hey, honey.

46:55.232 --> 46:56.775
She wasn't gonna jump.

46:56.775 --> 47:00.571
‐ Stop... trying to shield me
from everything, Dad! I saw!

47:01.822 --> 47:02.990
I fucking saw it.

47:02.990 --> 47:05.701
‐ Honey...
You know, as well as I do,

47:05.701 --> 47:06.994
your mother would‐‐

47:06.994 --> 47:08.245
‐ You watch me like I'm the problem.

47:08.245 --> 47:11.123
Do you realize you guys
are the fucked up ones inside?

47:11.123 --> 47:14.168
And all you do
is hide it from me.

47:14.168 --> 47:16.086
And from each other,
from everybody.

47:32.144 --> 47:35.564
One at a time.

47:36.440 --> 47:40.360
Oh, hey. Um, how's...
how's Frances?

47:40.360 --> 47:42.279
‐ She's hurting.

47:44.198 --> 47:46.325
You're right, Delilah, this is...

47:47.451 --> 47:50.621
a particularly volatile group.
But they're a brilliant one,

47:50.621 --> 47:52.331
and we need them all.

47:52.331 --> 47:54.374
Let's start the Protocol.
The new Protocol.

47:56.251 --> 47:59.254
‐ O... Okay, but it's, it's only day two.

47:59.254 --> 48:03.133
‐ Mm‐hmm. But we have to make it
to day three.

48:03.133 --> 48:04.593
We can't lose any of them.

48:04.593 --> 48:08.180
‐ They haven't fully detoxed.
It hasn't been tested.

48:08.180 --> 48:09.598
‐ They are begging to be saved.

48:09.598 --> 48:11.934
They're on their hands and knees.
You can both see that.

48:13.435 --> 48:15.395
I've made the decision.

48:16.313 --> 48:17.231
All right?

48:18.190 --> 48:19.483
Let's go, my loves.

48:20.442 --> 48:22.110
There is no time to waste.

48:25.489 --> 48:26.990
This is exciting.

48:38.460 --> 48:43.131
same old smile

48:49.763 --> 48:54.768
we shouldn't do

49:30.053 --> 49:34.850
we know is through

49:36.143 --> 49:40.898
we shouldn't do
