You just wanted to help.

got the better grade.

16:31.303 --> 16:34.261
That's the day
I fell in love with you.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.679
You know why?

16:36.679 --> 16:39.345
Because you were
too hung over to think straight?

16:41.178 --> 16:45.720
Because love is putting
someone else's happiness

16:45.720 --> 16:48.762
before your own...

16:48.762 --> 16:51.762

that they'll do the same.

If he didn't kill himself,
some Bromley Heath dirtbag did.

17:47.762 --> 17:49.929
But when a gangbanger
offs a rat,

17:49.929 --> 17:51.887
they make a show
of killing him.

17:51.887 --> 17:53.387
It sends a message.

17:53.387 --> 17:56.595
Disguising his death
as a suicide,

17:56.595 --> 18:00.095

18:04.053 --> 18:05.887
Now, the lab's checking
Roach's hand

18:05.887 --> 18:07.095

18:07.095 --> 18:08.970
-Mm-hmm.
-We'll finish this conversation

You'd have gone

18:41.595 --> 18:43.470
You got me.

18:43.470 --> 18:44.679
So you're staying?

18:44.679 --> 18:46.679
Yeah, if you don't mind.

18:46.679 --> 18:49.095
So, how is he?

18:49.095 --> 18:52.220
That's the second time you've
shown up here wondering that.

18:52.220 --> 18:53.679
Why don't you
ask him yourself?

18:53.679 --> 18:55.011
Ah, I would.

18:55.011 --> 18:56.970
Truth is,
I think he's ducking me.

19:14.595 --> 19:17.387
Do you know there's
this tribe in Nigeria

19:17.387 --> 19:19.387
where the night before a wedding
they have this tradition

19:19.387 --> 19:21.637
that the bride's family
takes the groom out

19:21.637 --> 19:24.220
and kicks the living crap out
of him to see if he's worthy.

19:24.220 --> 19:26.845
Right?
It's pretty inhuman to us.

19:26.845 --> 19:28.887
But to them,
it's just how they do things.

19:28.887 --> 19:30.428
It's their way of life.

27:18.887 --> 27:21.804
It's-- Jimmy's out
of his goddamn mind!

27:21.804 --> 27:23.428
Hey, no matter what you say,

27:23.428 --> 27:25.261
you're not going to be able
to convince him.

27:25.261 --> 27:26.470
Same goes for Frankie.

27:26.470 --> 27:28.095
Then you gotta
say something to him.

27:28.095 --> 27:29.428
Oh.

27:29.428 --> 27:31.470
He used to listen to me.

27:31.470 --> 27:33.762
That went away
a long time ago.

27:33.762 --> 27:37.095
You know what
I'm talkin' about, Cathy.

27:37.095 --> 27:39.679
You're already feeling the gulf
with Kick.

27:43.220 --> 27:44.512
Fuck.

27:53.470 --> 27:55.428
[Rachel]
Hey, pencil dick.

27:55.428 --> 27:56.637
[laughs]

27:56.637 --> 27:58.804
It's funny how that works.

27:58.804 --> 28:02.053
I say "pencil dick,"
you instinctively react.

28:04.470 --> 28:06.387
And who might you be?

28:06.387 --> 28:08.553
Rachel Benham,
County Sheriff's office.

28:10.095 --> 28:12.220
What can I do for you?

28:12.220 --> 28:13.261
Clay Roach.

28:13.261 --> 28:15.595
Who's that?

28:15.595 --> 28:17.220
He's an informant
for you guys

28:17.220 --> 28:18.345
at the FBI.

28:18.345 --> 28:19.804
Never heard of him.

28:19.804 --> 28:21.261
Hmm.

28:21.261 --> 28:23.679
Then why'd you give
Michaela Freda his name?

28:25.428 --> 28:27.178
I found her notebook.

28:27.178 --> 28:29.595
Inside: Southie Clasby,
Clay Roach.

28:29.595 --> 28:31.595
Big, fat arrow
connecting you two.

28:31.595 --> 28:33.720
And yet you never
heard of the guy?

28:35.804 --> 28:38.970
You know, there's a reason
little girls play house

28:38.970 --> 28:41.804
while little boys
play cops and robbers.

28:44.345 --> 28:46.261
Have you heard?

28:46.261 --> 28:48.428
Heard what?

28:48.428 --> 28:50.887
Clay Roach is dead.

28:50.887 --> 28:53.178
And he didn't die
of old age.

29:24.845 --> 29:27.553
Jackie. I spied you
coming down the hall.

29:27.553 --> 29:29.136
You want to sign the card?

29:29.136 --> 29:31.303
-No.
-You sure?

29:31.303 --> 29:34.595
Actually, I'd like to change
my answer to "fuck, no."

29:34.595 --> 29:35.929
Not even for Salvie?

29:35.929 --> 29:37.220
He was your partner,
for Chrissake's.

29:43.178 --> 29:46.762
[man] Maybe Gladys and I
will go to the Bahamas.

29:46.762 --> 29:48.637
[Jackie] How you doin'?
Get the fuck out.

29:50.220 --> 29:51.887
You quittin'?

29:51.887 --> 29:53.679
I'm not quittin'.
I'm retirin'.

29:53.679 --> 29:55.637
It's the same fuckin' thing.
It just sounds nicer.

29:55.637 --> 29:57.387
It's-- it's like saying
"mentally challenged"

29:57.387 --> 29:58.845
when your kid's
a fuckin' retard.

29:58.845 --> 30:00.428
What the fuck are you
gonna do all day?

30:00.428 --> 30:03.720
Sleep in, afternoon jog,
glass of wine before bed,

30:03.720 --> 30:04.970
be with my wife.

30:04.970 --> 30:07.720
Oh. I cannot begin
to tell you

30:07.720 --> 30:10.512
how fuckin' miserable
that sounds.

30:10.512 --> 30:12.303
A normal person
would congratulate me.

30:12.303 --> 30:13.762
Well, let's not start
to measure normal.

30:13.762 --> 30:16.178
You don't quite qualify either,
all right?

30:17.470 --> 30:18.804
Jackie...

30:20.762 --> 30:23.345
I don't know what
I'm doing here anymore.

30:23.345 --> 30:26.929
My instincts are gone.
All I got are habits.

30:26.929 --> 30:29.595
Our boss is under investigation
for using FBI money

30:29.595 --> 30:31.887
to fix up his house.

30:31.887 --> 30:34.428
I want to get out
while I'm still in the black.

30:34.428 --> 30:35.637
You should do the same.

30:35.637 --> 30:38.845
Fuck that.
I want my pension.

30:38.845 --> 30:40.929
Bullshit.
You want glory.

30:40.929 --> 30:44.261
Well, the thing about glory,
I wear it so well.

30:46.303 --> 30:48.804
-You ever feel guilty, Jackie?
-[scoffs]

30:48.804 --> 30:50.679
I mean, after all
the shit we pulled?

30:50.679 --> 30:53.970
Fidelity, bravery, integrity.
That's our motto, right?

30:53.970 --> 30:56.220
But you can never
have all three.

30:56.220 --> 30:58.345
Sometimes being brave cuts
you off from the fidelity part.

30:58.345 --> 31:00.387
And integrity?
Integrity is like pussy.

31:00.387 --> 31:02.595
We drive ourselves crazy
thinking that we need pussy.

31:02.595 --> 31:03.720
But at the end of the day,

31:03.720 --> 31:06.387
pussy don't get us
where we need to go.

31:07.387 --> 31:08.637
What we do...

31:09.762 --> 31:12.303
gotta be an animal
to fight the animals.

31:12.303 --> 31:13.470
Yeah.

31:13.470 --> 31:15.553
That's why I'm quittin'.

31:17.136 --> 31:18.887
[sighs]

31:23.053 --> 31:24.679
Does God watch me pee?

31:24.679 --> 31:26.345
Tony!

31:26.345 --> 31:28.970
Why would you ask
a question like that, buddy?

31:28.970 --> 31:32.345
My CCD teacher said
God can see everything

31:32.345 --> 31:33.887
all the time.

31:33.887 --> 31:36.136
Must mean he sees me pee.

31:36.136 --> 31:38.804
True. That's why girls sit down,
to hide their privates.

31:38.804 --> 31:40.136
-Kick!
-[Cathy] All right.

31:40.136 --> 31:42.595
Ignore your sister.
God is a gentleman,

31:42.595 --> 31:45.261
and he closes his eyes
when you're in the bathroom.

31:45.261 --> 31:47.762
Dad, can we see the airplanes
after school?

31:47.762 --> 31:49.637
We just saw the airplanes?

31:49.637 --> 31:51.345
So? I like 'em.

31:51.345 --> 31:54.261
[Frankie] We can't go
the same place twice.

31:54.261 --> 31:56.220
That's...
[imitates snoring]

31:56.220 --> 31:58.428
-...boring.
-[kids laugh]

31:58.428 --> 32:01.553
We're gonna try
something new, all right?

32:01.553 --> 32:02.595
-For real?
-For real.

32:02.595 --> 32:06.428
I got loads
of secret spots.

32:06.428 --> 32:07.929
I got spots that are so secret

32:07.929 --> 32:09.345
that sometimes I can hardly
find 'em myself.

32:09.345 --> 32:11.804
[all laugh]

32:11.804 --> 32:13.345
All right, you guys.
Come on, finish.

32:13.345 --> 32:14.679
We gotta go.

32:14.679 --> 32:16.095
-Bye, Daddy.
-Bye.

32:16.095 --> 32:18.345
-Coats, please. Backpacks.
-Boom!

32:18.345 --> 32:20.637
Boom! Bam!

32:21.637 --> 32:23.762
Bow.

32:23.762 --> 32:27.970
[Cathy] Here, lunches. Coats on.
Lunches are right here.

32:27.970 --> 32:29.762
Grab your backpack, please.
Get your brother's.

32:29.762 --> 32:31.637
[Frankie] I'll pick you up
from school at 3:00 sharp.

32:31.637 --> 32:32.970
[Kick]
Okay, Daddy.

32:40.929 --> 32:42.720
I'm gonna call you
after work.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.553
Okay.

32:44.553 --> 32:46.011
I love you.

32:46.011 --> 32:47.804
-Bye, Daddy.
-Bye-bye, guys. Have a good one.

32:47.804 --> 32:49.345
[Cathy] All right, guys,
let's get goin'.

32:49.345 --> 32:51.220
In the car.
Come on, let's go.

32:51.220 --> 32:53.887
-Hi, Uncle Jimmy.
-Oh, hey, sweetheart.

32:53.887 --> 32:56.011
-Have a good day at school.
-[girls] Bye.

32:56.011 --> 32:57.345
Bye.

32:57.345 --> 32:58.762
You take your meds today?

33:00.178 --> 33:02.428
Yeah, I did.
Two blues and a yellow.

33:02.428 --> 33:03.970
Thank you, Dr. Cathy.

33:05.178 --> 33:07.679
Be a man today, Jimmy,
all right?

33:07.679 --> 33:09.011
[scoffs]

33:09.011 --> 33:10.512
I mean it.

33:10.512 --> 33:12.553
Hey, all right, come on.
In the car.

33:12.553 --> 33:15.178
Fuck's her problem?

33:15.178 --> 33:17.220
I don't know.

33:17.220 --> 33:20.053
I think she's concerned
with how things are gonna go...

33:20.053 --> 33:21.679
considering you tried
to kill yourself.

33:21.679 --> 33:24.428
Oh, fuck. Ma told you.
Fuckin' bitch. Fuck.

33:24.428 --> 33:25.762
Cathy thinks...

33:27.178 --> 33:28.762
I think...

33:28.762 --> 33:31.011
you should sit this one out.

33:31.011 --> 33:33.136
And leave you a man short?
No way.

33:34.887 --> 33:36.345
Why'd you hang that noose?

33:36.345 --> 33:38.345
[laughs]

33:38.345 --> 33:40.220
Because I heard about how
when you're gettin' strangled,

33:40.220 --> 33:41.887
the blood that's supposed
to go to your brain

33:41.887 --> 33:44.679
-goes to your nutsack.
-Yeah. I'm serious, Jimmy.

33:44.679 --> 33:46.553
There's nothing fuckin' serious
about it, okay?

33:46.553 --> 33:48.303
I...it's just--

33:48.303 --> 33:52.261
It's a fuckin' misunderstanding.
I-I drank too much.

33:52.261 --> 33:55.929
And...and then, you know,
I got sad

33:55.929 --> 33:58.637
about Megan and--
and Nikki leaving.

33:58.637 --> 34:00.720
It's fuckin' embarrassing,
is all.

34:00.720 --> 34:02.512
There's no shame in you
walking away right now.

34:02.512 --> 34:03.679
I'm fine.

34:05.345 --> 34:07.387
All right? Actually,
I'm better off, all right?

34:07.387 --> 34:09.345
I got clarity now.

34:09.345 --> 34:11.553
And maybe-- maybe Cathy's
only half wrong.

34:11.553 --> 34:14.011
I think you should
sit this one out.

34:14.011 --> 34:19.095
I may be a fuckup, all right?
But I know that about myself.

34:19.095 --> 34:21.345
Every time that I...

34:21.345 --> 34:23.220
that I get involved
in something,

34:23.220 --> 34:25.470
there's always a chance
it could turn to shit, you know?

34:25.470 --> 34:27.428
And...

34:27.428 --> 34:29.762
if that happens,
I just...

34:30.804 --> 34:32.428
I don't wanna--

34:32.428 --> 34:34.512
I don't wanna drag you
down with me, you know?

34:36.428 --> 34:38.178
That's why
I got to be there.

34:39.595 --> 34:41.929
To make sure that everything
goes as it should.

34:44.095 --> 34:45.220
Yeah.

34:46.345 --> 34:47.679
Yeah.

35:06.512 --> 35:08.220
[mouthing]

35:09.470 --> 35:10.970
[doors open]

35:10.970 --> 35:12.970
[chatter, laughter]

35:15.011 --> 35:16.804
Jenny.

35:16.804 --> 35:18.428
You weren't in class.

35:18.428 --> 35:21.220
You missed my presentation
on psychoanalysis.

35:21.220 --> 35:24.220
DJ, I-- I'm droppin' out.

35:27.970 --> 35:30.345
I thought teaching
was your passion.

35:30.345 --> 35:32.220
How would I know
if it's my passion?

35:32.220 --> 35:34.762
I've never taught a day
in my entire life.

35:34.762 --> 35:38.136
I feel like an asshole
for even saying that.

35:39.345 --> 35:42.095
Look, quitting
is a big decision.

35:42.095 --> 35:44.845
You said I'm a good listener,
so before you do anything

35:44.845 --> 35:46.762
just let me listen.

35:59.762 --> 36:01.845
DJ...[laughs]

36:01.845 --> 36:04.011
You don't have to do
anything to me.

36:05.178 --> 36:06.804
I can just
take care of you.

36:08.345 --> 36:10.261
This should be fun.
No stress.

36:10.261 --> 36:12.011
Yeah, there's just...

36:12.011 --> 36:13.553
it's just there's rules
against this.

36:13.553 --> 36:16.720
Being unfaithful.
I'm Catholic.

36:16.720 --> 36:19.011
-So am I.
-Yeah, but you ain't married.

36:20.762 --> 36:22.220
How about we just talk?

36:25.512 --> 36:26.929
Jenny, the last thing
I want to do

36:26.929 --> 36:28.637
is make you feel
uncomfortable.

36:28.637 --> 36:29.970
Please don't be nice.

36:29.970 --> 36:33.470
I-I know you mean well,

36:33.470 --> 36:36.303
but, you know you're...
[laughs]

36:36.303 --> 36:38.220
...you sound like, uh...

36:39.720 --> 36:41.011
[sighs]

36:45.220 --> 36:47.345
My whole life, I've only been
with two men.

36:49.428 --> 36:52.053
And neither of them
treated me any good.

36:55.261 --> 36:56.887
Your husband...

36:56.887 --> 36:58.136
does he hurt you?

36:58.136 --> 36:59.970
No, no,
it's not like that.

36:59.970 --> 37:03.095
No, Jackie, uh,
doesn't abuse me.

37:04.178 --> 37:06.720
At least not physically.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.679
Huh.
Like that's a compliment.

37:10.011 --> 37:11.512
And the other guy?

37:12.804 --> 37:13.929
Did he hit you?

37:17.470 --> 37:18.595
No, worse.

37:23.095 --> 37:25.428
I never told anyone, uh,

37:25.428 --> 37:27.679
but Jackie knew
somethin' happened.

37:27.679 --> 37:30.095
Somethin'... bad.

37:30.095 --> 37:33.136
And a couple of years
after we got married,

37:33.136 --> 37:36.428
Jackie confronted him,
made him leave town.

37:36.428 --> 37:38.512
At least I think
that's what happened.

37:41.470 --> 37:43.261
Jackie could have killed him,
for all I know.

37:44.970 --> 37:46.637
Who was this asshole?

37:50.136 --> 37:51.762
It was my dad.

37:55.720 --> 37:57.387
Happened in our basement.

37:57.387 --> 37:59.387
That's where I used
to do my homework.

38:00.470 --> 38:01.929
I was 14.

38:05.053 --> 38:06.470
He was drunk.

38:07.762 --> 38:09.261
Sweaty.

38:09.261 --> 38:11.303
He-- He had this blister
on his thumb.

38:14.804 --> 38:16.303
I couldn't look at him.

38:18.261 --> 38:20.136
So I just--
I turned my head.

38:23.929 --> 38:26.428
All I could do was stare
at his stupid airplanes.

38:30.428 --> 38:33.929
When I finally told my ma,
she seemed...

38:33.929 --> 38:35.512
happy...

38:35.512 --> 38:38.095
that he went after me
and not some stranger, you know?

38:38.095 --> 38:40.428
Me. Me, she could control.

38:42.178 --> 38:43.679
Bleach out the stain.

38:47.261 --> 38:49.387
She even drove me herself

38:49.387 --> 38:52.804
to make sure the mistake
was taken care of.

38:57.303 --> 38:58.679
[sighs]

39:00.637 --> 39:02.553
Anytime there's a robbery,

39:02.553 --> 39:04.845
the police point their fingers
at Charlestown.

39:04.845 --> 39:07.011
