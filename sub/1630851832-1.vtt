11:13.977 --> 11:15.457

11:15.500 --> 11:17.720

off balance.

The film disorients

Perhaps the first-ever

into its own in this film.

So "Scream 2" gets to comment
on, you know, the history

who can you blame?"

14:43.534 --> 14:45.362
we can blame the parents.

Bad parenting creates psychos.

19:35.652 --> 19:38.220
- By the end,
a ruthless drug dealer,

19:38.264 --> 19:40.483
who in virtually any other
movie would be a villain,

19:40.527 --> 19:42.181
almost singlehandedly

19:42.224 --> 19:46.837
fights off
the government assassins.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.579
- You know, he's the
community "thug" so to speak,

19:49.623 --> 19:51.625
who has to sort of rise up

19:51.668 --> 19:55.237
and fight off these outsiders...

19:55.281 --> 19:57.892
[rapid gunfire]

19:57.935 --> 20:00.764
Who have literally flooded
this poor community

to try to just kill
as many Black and brown people

20:03.245 --> 20:04.942
as they can.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.379
And it's tough.
It's tough to watch.

[gunfire]

20:17.520 --> 20:19.305
- That's the truth.

20:19.348 --> 20:21.872
What do we do and how are we
supposed to remain optimistic?

20:21.916 --> 20:24.397
Which they do,
which is a beautiful ending.

20:24.440 --> 20:25.659
It's very optimistic.

20:25.702 --> 20:27.704
And "We're gonna fight
this thing."

20:27.748 --> 20:31.665
But honestly, where do you go
after that moment?

20:31.708 --> 20:33.406
- So what to do we do now?

20:33.449 --> 20:37.236
- Now...we fight.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.281
- When I spoke to a lot
of my friends about it,

20:39.325 --> 20:42.284
"The First Purge" felt
the most truest to real life

20:42.328 --> 20:45.505
and people felt like
"Yo, wow. This--this feels

20:45.548 --> 20:47.202
like it could actually happen.

- For now.

20:59.345 --> 21:02.043
[tense music]

21:02.086 --> 21:03.610

to breathe life

21:03.653 --> 21:05.612
into a horror sequel.

21:05.655 --> 21:06.917
- Awake! Awake! Awake!

to the end. [laughs]

21:26.546 --> 21:29.940
- Feels tapped out?

21:29.984 --> 21:32.552
- There had been
three Chucky movies,

21:32.595 --> 21:35.119
"Child's Play" 1, 2, and 3.

21:35.163 --> 21:38.340
"But Child's Play 3"
was not very successful.

21:38.384 --> 21:39.907
- You got me.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.517
I'm bad.

21:41.561 --> 21:44.346
- And I felt that we had fallen
into a rut of kind of

21:44.390 --> 21:45.956
remaking the same movie.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.091
All: Ade due Damballa.

- And that was something
I didn't want to do again.

21:52.920 --> 21:55.705
- So Chucky creator
Don Mancini threw away

21:55.749 --> 22:00.144
the slasher formula and went
in a very different direction.

Horror comedy.

22:04.801 --> 22:08.936
The result
was "Bride of Chucky."

22:08.979 --> 22:11.634
- I felt that if
we embraced the absurdity

22:11.678 --> 22:13.332
inherent in the premise

22:13.375 --> 22:15.377
of a two-foot killer doll
who swears

22:15.421 --> 22:18.075
and wields a knife and
chases you down and kills you,

22:18.119 --> 22:21.035
we could revive the franchise.

22:21.078 --> 22:23.820
- "Bride of Chucky"
introduces Tiffany,

22:23.864 --> 22:25.605
girlfriend
of the serial killer

22:25.648 --> 22:26.867

22:26.910 --> 22:29.260
- Well, hello, dolly.

22:29.304 --> 22:32.394
- She's determined to bring
her lover back to life

to get her way.

Jennifer Tilly was cast

22:41.969 --> 22:45.799
opposite Brad Dourif,
the voice of Chucky.

22:45.842 --> 22:49.280
- She's the perfect person
for this in so many ways.

22:49.324 --> 22:52.109
She's an Oscar nominee,
just as Brad Dourif is,

22:52.153 --> 22:56.375
she has incredible
comedic charisma,

22:56.418 --> 23:00.727
physical beauty, sexiness,
and a wonderful voice.

23:00.770 --> 23:03.512
- Thanks, sweet face,
I owe ya one.

23:03.556 --> 23:05.732
- Tiffany has
a certain insouciance

23:05.775 --> 23:07.603
that people are attracted to.

23:07.647 --> 23:09.605
I mean she's just like

23:13.870 --> 23:15.872
- Promises, promises.

23:15.916 --> 23:17.439
- But she's also a dichotomy

23:17.483 --> 23:19.223
because she loves
Martha Stewart,

23:19.267 --> 23:20.834
she likes to make
Swedish meatballs

23:20.877 --> 23:22.618
and chocolate chip cookies.

23:22.662 --> 23:24.577
- Who the [bleep]
is Martha Stewart?

23:24.620 --> 23:26.274
- My idol.

23:26.317 --> 23:28.450
- Whoa!

23:28.494 --> 23:31.627
- To be Chucky's soulmate,
of course, she had to be

23:31.671 --> 23:34.064
a remorseless killer,

23:34.108 --> 23:37.067
but on the other hand,
she's also very sentimental

23:37.111 --> 23:40.244
and romantic
and kind of sweet.

23:40.288 --> 23:43.247
- We belong dead.

23:43.291 --> 23:45.249
- That's not Chucky at all.

23:45.293 --> 23:50.907
So it created
a combustible relationship.

23:50.951 --> 23:52.605
- Tiffany resurrects Chucky

23:52.648 --> 23:54.824
but their reunion
quickly turns sour.

23:54.868 --> 23:59.046
- [screaming]

23:59.089 --> 24:02.092
[screams]

24:02.136 --> 24:04.486
- After a fatal
lover's quarrel,

24:04.530 --> 24:08.316
Tiffany's spirit is also
trapped in plastic.

24:08.359 --> 24:13.147
- You son of bitch!
What have you done to me?

24:13.190 --> 24:15.845
When she suddenly finds herself
in a doll's body,

24:15.889 --> 24:17.717
she's kind--she's mad.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.675
I mean, but she doesn't
fall into depression.

24:19.719 --> 24:21.372
She gets out the hair dye

24:21.416 --> 24:24.245
and the black nail polish
and tries to approximate a look

24:24.288 --> 24:26.726
that she is comfortable with.

24:26.769 --> 24:30.077
- To regain human form,
the couple needs to get across

24:30.120 --> 24:33.907
the country
to steal a magical amulet.

24:33.950 --> 24:37.301
They hitch a ride with two
unsuspecting teenage runaways.

24:37.345 --> 24:39.521
- Oh, my God.

24:39.565 --> 24:42.568
- A road trip that quickly
turns into a bloodbath.

24:42.611 --> 24:44.700
[horn blares]

24:44.744 --> 24:47.137
- There is so much more gore

24:47.181 --> 24:48.704
in this movie
than the other films.

24:48.748 --> 24:51.751
- It's a measure of how much
respect Don has for you

24:51.794 --> 24:53.709
if he kills you
in a really horrible way.

24:53.753 --> 24:55.668
- Now!
- [gasps]

24:55.711 --> 24:58.932
- Ah!

24:58.975 --> 25:01.151
- Killing together helps
Chucky and Tiffany

25:01.195 --> 25:04.546
revive their love and lust.

25:04.590 --> 25:07.244
- All couples have something
that brings them together

25:07.288 --> 25:08.855
in the first place.

25:08.898 --> 25:10.683
In Chucky and Tiffany's case,
of course,

25:10.726 --> 25:12.859
it's murder and sex.

25:12.902 --> 25:14.556
- Well, at least
you haven't forgotten

25:14.600 --> 25:17.211
how to show a girl a good time.

25:17.254 --> 25:19.169
- So they have their
honeymoon period

25:19.213 --> 25:23.913
which climaxes in their
big night in Niagara Falls.

25:23.957 --> 25:26.786
- One of the bloodiest scenes
in the movie

25:26.829 --> 25:30.920
leads into one of the most
strange and ridiculous scenes

25:30.964 --> 25:32.574
in the whole film.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.968
Which is when
they're in the love motel.

25:35.011 --> 25:36.752
And that couple's in the bed.

25:36.796 --> 25:38.319
Tiffany has
the champagne bottle

25:38.362 --> 25:40.016
and throws it up
into the mirror.

25:40.060 --> 25:43.498
And it just shatters into
hundreds of pieces

25:43.542 --> 25:45.282
and impales them
on the waterbed.

25:45.326 --> 25:48.895
And blood and water
explodes everywhere,

25:48.938 --> 25:50.679
which then leads into...

25:50.723 --> 25:54.378
a very bizarre sex scene.

25:54.422 --> 25:57.033
- Oh.

25:57.077 --> 26:00.733
- Which is so weird,
but so fantastic.

26:00.776 --> 26:02.735
But again, really weird.

26:02.778 --> 26:05.041
[laughs]

26:05.085 --> 26:07.000
- We were the first people
to do doll sex.

26:07.043 --> 26:10.046
After that, "South Park" did a
movie where they had doll sex.

26:10.090 --> 26:14.529
Our doll sex I thought
was a little bit more charming.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.313
- But like many love stories,

26:16.357 --> 26:19.403
this one takes a tragic turn.

26:19.447 --> 26:23.233
- She so wants to be loved
by Chucky,

26:23.277 --> 26:25.148
and does so much stuff
for Chucky,

26:25.192 --> 26:27.586
like cooking
and making his favorite dish

26:27.629 --> 26:29.588
and trying to make him happy.

26:29.631 --> 26:32.808
And he does a thing where
he's critical or puts her down.

26:32.852 --> 26:35.289
And then every once in a while,
she snaps.

26:35.332 --> 26:38.509
- Those dishes aren't gonna
wash themselves, you know.

26:38.553 --> 26:41.251
- The Tiffany character
is an abused woman.

26:41.295 --> 26:43.253
You know,
she's an abused spouse.

26:43.297 --> 26:46.605
The movie's throwing in
its sympathies

26:46.648 --> 26:49.042
with the woman victim.

26:49.085 --> 26:51.174
- [grunting]

26:51.218 --> 26:53.786
- [screams]

26:53.829 --> 26:56.440
- I feel like the "Bride of
Chucky" is a romantic tragedy

26:56.484 --> 26:59.269
because it's almost
Romeo and Juliet.

26:59.313 --> 27:02.229
It's almost like a love
that was never meant to be.

27:02.272 --> 27:04.274
I love you, Chucky.

27:04.318 --> 27:08.148
We belong together, forever.

27:08.191 --> 27:09.671
- And at the end,

27:09.715 --> 27:14.067
she turns the tables
on her abuser.

27:14.110 --> 27:17.810
- [grunts]
- [screams]

27:17.853 --> 27:20.247
- We belong dead.

27:20.290 --> 27:22.989
Goodbye, darling.

27:23.032 --> 27:24.947
I'll see you in hell.

27:24.991 --> 27:26.427
- [groans]

27:28.472 --> 27:30.039
- Following up a hit
is difficult.

27:30.083 --> 27:31.432
[eerie music]

27:31.475 --> 27:34.174
- [screams]

27:34.217 --> 27:36.524
- Now imagine making a sequel

27:36.567 --> 27:39.222
to an all-time horror classic.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.230
- In 1960
Alfred Hitchcock directed

27:47.274 --> 27:50.843
one of the most famous and
influential films of all time,

27:50.886 --> 27:52.279
"Psycho."

27:52.322 --> 27:53.976
- We all go a little mad
sometimes.

27:54.020 --> 27:56.718
Haven't you?

27:56.762 --> 28:00.809
- 23 years later came
the sequel no one asked for.

28:00.853 --> 28:02.202
[dramatic musical sting]

28:02.245 --> 28:04.334
"Psycho II."

28:04.378 --> 28:07.294
- By the '80s, Hitchcock
was treated like some sort of

28:07.337 --> 28:09.688
cinematic saint.
- Mm-hmm.

28:09.731 --> 28:14.867
- So the idea of remaking
a Hitchcock film--

28:14.910 --> 28:18.348
- The idea of sequelizing a
Hitchcock icon was unthinkable.

28:18.392 --> 28:21.003
- People talked about it
like sacrilege.

28:21.047 --> 28:22.309
- I'm sorry.

28:22.352 --> 28:25.355
I didn't mean it
to sound uncaring.

28:25.399 --> 28:28.315
- What do you know
about caring?

28:28.358 --> 28:31.057
- But "Psycho 2"
proved everyone wrong.

28:31.100 --> 28:34.625
Richard Franklin, director
of the Australian thriller

28:34.669 --> 28:37.933
"Road Games," was convinced
he could make a sequel

28:37.977 --> 28:39.848
that paid tribute
to the original

28:39.892 --> 28:42.764
but was strong enough
to stand on its own.

28:42.808 --> 28:46.768
Franklin hired Tom Holland,
another Hitchcock disciple,

28:46.812 --> 28:48.378
to write the screenplay.

28:48.422 --> 28:50.772
- I was desperate for a job,

28:50.816 --> 28:54.080
and I thought, "Well, that's
really the end of my career."

28:54.123 --> 28:58.606
Because I--you just knew that
the critics were gonna savage

28:58.649 --> 29:01.348
you for having
the temerity to do it.

29:01.391 --> 29:03.002
- Holland and Franklin knew

29:03.045 --> 29:04.786
that they couldn't give
"Psycho" the sequel

29:04.830 --> 29:08.921
it deserved
without one essential element.

29:08.964 --> 29:11.401
- The only way
that we could do it

29:11.445 --> 29:15.144
was to get Tony Perkins back
as Norman Bates.

29:15.188 --> 29:17.190
♪

29:17.233 --> 29:20.759
Tony had felt that
the Norman Bates was a curse.

29:20.802 --> 29:23.239
And so he didn't want
to do a sequel.

29:23.283 --> 29:26.112
So I had to figure out
how to write a script

29:26.155 --> 29:29.550
that would be so terrific
for the actor

29:29.593 --> 29:32.031
that he'd have to do it.

29:32.074 --> 29:34.773
And so it was how to give him
a character arc,

29:34.816 --> 29:38.298
how to make it into
an acting piece.

29:38.341 --> 29:40.213
And that's how I came up with,

29:40.256 --> 29:43.825
well, you just ask logically,
if it's 22 years later--

29:43.869 --> 29:46.262
which is what the time had been
since the original--

29:46.306 --> 29:48.482
where would Norman have been?

29:48.525 --> 29:51.050
- The film opens as
Norman Bates is released

29:51.093 --> 29:54.053
from a mental facility
and returns home.

29:54.096 --> 29:56.229
His doctor says he is cured.

29:56.272 --> 29:58.405
Others have their doubts.

29:58.448 --> 30:00.450
Norman's redemption
is threatened

30:00.494 --> 30:04.019
by a vengeful figure
from his past, Lila Loomis.

30:04.063 --> 30:07.066
The sister of the woman
Norman killed in the shower.

30:07.109 --> 30:10.243
Once again, Lila is played
by Vera Miles.

30:10.286 --> 30:12.462
- And when he murders again,

30:12.506 --> 30:14.682
you will be
directly responsible.

30:14.725 --> 30:18.164
- I think we identify with
Norman in a different way

30:18.207 --> 30:21.341
in "Psycho 2"
than we did in "Psycho 1."

30:21.384 --> 30:24.474
"Psycho 2" is about, you know,

30:24.518 --> 30:28.000
a misfit trying to find
his way back to the world.

30:28.043 --> 30:29.697
- Can I help you?

30:29.740 --> 30:32.613
- I'm Norman. Norman Bates.

30:32.656 --> 30:35.485
The new cook's helper.

30:35.529 --> 30:38.445
- Norman gets a job at a diner
and begins a relationship

30:38.488 --> 30:42.797
with a sympathetic coworker,
Mary, played by Meg Tilly.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.233
They move in together.

30:44.277 --> 30:46.801
- Is this room
where you had your troubles?

30:46.845 --> 30:49.195
- One of them, yeah.

30:49.238 --> 30:50.674
- Well, I don't know what
happened to you in the past,

30:50.718 --> 30:51.893
Norman, but you're never
gonna get over it.

30:51.937 --> 30:54.635
Not unless you face it.

30:54.678 --> 30:57.464
- Then he starts getting
messages from Mother.

30:57.507 --> 30:59.683
[tense music]

30:59.727 --> 31:02.469
Is Norman back
to his old ways,

31:02.512 --> 31:04.471
or is someone trying
to frame him?

31:04.514 --> 31:07.778
- I'm becoming...
confused again.

31:07.822 --> 31:09.693
- You're rooting for Norman
to keep it together.

31:09.737 --> 31:12.479
You're rooting for Norman
to be a--to be sane.

31:12.522 --> 31:14.916
To be happy.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.658
And now you don't want any
of the horror stuff to happen.

31:17.701 --> 31:19.747
- To stay true
to Hitchcock's style

31:19.790 --> 31:22.141
while updating it for 1983,

31:22.184 --> 31:25.666
Richard Franklin hired
cinematographer Dean Cundey,

31:25.709 --> 31:28.669
then known for
"Halloween" and "The Thing."

31:28.712 --> 31:32.107
- Originally, we wanted to do it
in black and white

31:32.151 --> 31:35.502
so that it looked like
the original.

31:35.545 --> 31:37.939
But Universal was pretty
adamant,

31:37.983 --> 31:39.680
no black and white.

31:39.723 --> 31:43.336
Richard was very, very specific
about how he wanted to,

31:43.379 --> 31:47.079
you know, make sure that
visually our version

31:47.122 --> 31:48.515
was a continuation.

31:48.558 --> 31:51.126
Nothing unusual.

31:51.170 --> 31:54.260
And to me, that was
a great sort of challenge,

31:54.303 --> 31:57.263
but fun thing to look at.

31:57.306 --> 31:59.961
- The filmmakers also
modernized the sequel

32:00.005 --> 32:01.876
with graphic violence
Hitchcock wouldn't have

32:01.920 --> 32:05.401
been allowed to show in 1960.

32:05.445 --> 32:07.360
- This is very post "Friday
the 13," post "Halloween,"

32:07.403 --> 32:08.883
so you do get some nods to that.

32:08.927 --> 32:09.971
You get to Dennis Franz,
for example,

32:10.015 --> 32:12.017
getting his face slashed.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.322

color version of what happens

32:17.022 --> 32:18.980
to Martin Balsam in the
original one, but you know,

32:19.024 --> 32:21.591
to see it in color makes
a big difference, obviously.

32:21.635 --> 32:24.159
- "Psycho 2" ends
with a series of twists

32:24.203 --> 32:26.292
that would make
Hitchcock proud.

32:26.335 --> 32:28.424
- Why did you lie to that
sheriff and say Bates

32:28.468 --> 32:30.992
was with you this afternoon?
- Mother.

32:31.036 --> 32:33.603
- The Meg Tilly character is
the daughter of Vera Miles.

32:33.647 --> 32:35.649
They start to torture him
and drive him mad.

32:35.692 --> 32:38.565
And then Mary,
who's wormed her way

32:38.608 --> 32:41.002
into living in the house
with Norman,

32:41.046 --> 32:43.613
starts to feel sorry
for Norman.

32:43.657 --> 32:45.180
- I've been to all
your meetings,

32:45.224 --> 32:46.834
I've done everything
you've asked me for years,

32:46.877 --> 32:49.054
but I am not going to hurt
Norman anymore.

32:49.097 --> 32:51.926
- And she realizes that Norman
really is a good person

32:51.970 --> 32:55.364
at that moment and trying to
hold on to his sanity.

32:55.408 --> 32:58.019
- Norman, do you recognize me?

32:58.063 --> 32:59.412
It's me, your mother.

32:59.455 --> 33:02.415
- And eventually,
it costs her life

33:02.458 --> 33:05.026
because Norman has gone crazy.

33:05.070 --> 33:07.811
- Let me help you.

doesn't suck

33:13.295 --> 33:15.994

makes sense.

Typically in good sequels,

[tense music]

33:23.262 --> 33:25.612
Here in "Psycho 2" you find
out that Norman's mother

33:25.655 --> 33:27.005
really wasn't his mother.

33:27.048 --> 33:28.528
- So...

33:28.571 --> 33:29.746
are you really my mother?

33:29.790 --> 33:31.661
- That his real mother
is still around.

33:31.705 --> 33:35.056
- The woman you thought was
your mother was my sister.

33:35.100 --> 33:38.146
- And that she's the one
that's been killing everybody,

33:38.190 --> 33:40.844

what they did to Norman,

33:40.888 --> 33:43.804
putting him away.

33:43.847 --> 33:46.589
And he whacks her
over the head with a shovel.

33:46.633 --> 33:48.417
And then he's back to being
Norman Bates again.

33:48.461 --> 33:50.854
[dramatic music]

33:50.898 --> 33:52.682
He carries her up the stairs

33:52.726 --> 33:54.206

again.

33:54.249 --> 33:56.860
- I'm not sleepy.

33:56.904 --> 33:59.080
Put me in my chair.

33:59.124 --> 34:00.603
- Yes, Mother.

34:00.647 --> 34:02.475
- So the arc of the movie

34:02.518 --> 34:06.261
is really Norman
losing his mind

34:06.305 --> 34:08.089
a second time

34:08.133 --> 34:09.917
and the irony is,

he ends up at the end of the
movie as crazy as a loon

34:14.356 --> 34:16.097

34:16.141 --> 34:18.056
It's a tragedy, in a way.

34:18.099 --> 34:20.406

to the institution.

34:20.449 --> 34:23.539

as great as he is in "Psycho,"

34:23.583 --> 34:25.976
I think he's even better
in "Psycho 2."

34:26.020 --> 34:28.544

lead performances

34:28.588 --> 34:30.459

- It's eating
my vegetable medley.

39:43.468 --> 39:45.513
- [burps]

39:45.557 --> 39:47.776
- Mutant products of gremlins
running amok

39:47.820 --> 39:49.648
in the genetics lab.

39:49.691 --> 39:51.998
- There is a phenomenal
Key and Peele sketch

39:52.041 --> 39:53.826
about the pitching
of "Gremlins 2"

39:53.869 --> 39:55.741
that's so [bleep] funny.

39:55.784 --> 39:57.264
- What if we did this?

39:57.307 --> 40:01.486
Everybody here gets to design
they own Gremlin.

40:01.529 --> 40:05.228
- They weren't just like cute
and fluffy and then green.

40:05.272 --> 40:09.058
These were mutated Gremlins.

40:09.102 --> 40:13.149
So you get spider Gremlins,
flying Gremlins.

40:13.193 --> 40:15.021
- [screeching]

40:15.064 --> 40:16.979
You got talking Gremlins.

40:17.023 --> 40:19.460
- Mind if I have a brief word
with you?

40:19.504 --> 40:21.854
- You got my favorite,
you got the bougie Gremlins

40:21.897 --> 40:23.986
with big red lips,

40:24.030 --> 40:27.076
super incredible dress and wig.

40:27.120 --> 40:29.992
And of course the flashing
Gremlin with the sick glasses.

40:30.036 --> 40:32.342
- [laughing]

40:32.386 --> 40:36.477
- You got ever single Gremlin
you could want in the movie.

40:36.521 --> 40:39.088
- The madness builds until
the spectacular finale

40:39.132 --> 40:42.831
when the heroes manage to
prevent a Gremlin apocalypse.

40:42.875 --> 40:46.313
[electricity sparking]

40:46.356 --> 40:49.490
- I'm melting! I'm melting.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.971
- "Gremlins 2" just gets better
every time you see it.

40:52.014 --> 40:54.669
- "Gremlins 2," I think,

40:54.713 --> 40:57.803
might possibly be the
best sequel of all time.

40:57.846 --> 41:00.283
- Probably "Gremlins 2"
is my most personal movie.

41:00.327 --> 41:03.809
Not in that it's personal to me,
except that it's

41:03.852 --> 41:05.724
my most unfiltered movie.

41:05.767 --> 41:06.986
I had nobody
looking over my shoulder,

41:07.029 --> 41:09.597
telling me what to do,

41:09.641 --> 41:11.251
and there's a lot of me in it.

41:11.294 --> 41:13.427
- And to this day, there's never
been a "Gremlins 3."

41:13.471 --> 41:16.778
'Cause it feels like
"Gremlins 2" scorched the earth.

41:16.822 --> 41:20.173
- [groaning]

41:20.216 --> 41:23.350
- Horror sequels give us a way
to return to the worlds

41:23.393 --> 41:27.180
that fascinated and frightened
us the first time around.

41:27.223 --> 41:31.271
We get to see our favorite
characters back in action.

41:31.314 --> 41:34.840
And we get more of everything.

41:34.883 --> 41:36.842
More monsters. More scares.

41:36.885 --> 41:39.061
- [screams]

41:39.105 --> 41:42.108
- Bigger and crazier kills.

41:42.151 --> 41:45.764
The best sequels give us
what we want--

41:45.807 --> 41:47.722
make the old seem new again.

41:47.766 --> 41:50.072
