WEBVTT

00:59.434 --> 01:01.019
<i>How often do you come to Brooklyn?</i>

01:01.102 --> 01:02.937
Honestly, the only time
I come to Brooklyn

01:03.021 --> 01:05.065
-is to eat at this neighborhood.

01:05.148 --> 01:10.111
Frankies, Pok Pok,
and if the line is not too long, Lucali's.

01:10.195 --> 01:12.947
But the main reason I come
is to eat at Lucali's.

01:15.617 --> 01:18.453
<i>My favorite time to come here</i>
<i>is the summer or spring,</i>

01:18.536 --> 01:20.371
when you can bring your own beer,

01:20.455 --> 01:22.540
if the line's long,
you put your name down...

01:22.624 --> 01:24.292
<i> You hang out.</i>
<i>-Hang out.</i>

01:24.375 --> 01:29.172
Sometimes I get a couple spicy tuna rolls
at the sushi place on the corner.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.049
Really?
When I first opened,

01:37.013 --> 01:41.643
I made the dough one night
and I didn't put enough water in it.

01:41.726 --> 01:42.560
I couldn't stretch it.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.814
So, I called my brother.
He lives right around the block.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.233
I was like, "Yo, bring
Grandma's rolling pin in here."

01:48.316 --> 01:51.069
The line was crazy
and I couldn't make pizza.

01:51.152 --> 01:53.321
He took too long.
I just grabbed a wine bottle,

01:53.404 --> 01:55.532
started doing it,
the pizzas came out better.

01:56.157 --> 01:59.619
<i>When you roll it,</i>
<i>you get more of a flat, crispier pie.</i>

02:00.245 --> 02:02.205
How did you end up
with that dough?

02:02.288 --> 02:03.248
It's what I made.

02:04.249 --> 02:06.292
You know, it's like I says,
I thought, "Yeah, it's dough."

02:06.376 --> 02:09.629
I didn't know
the whole process and everything.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.470
<i>In the kitchen,</i>
<i>I love the camaraderie</i>

02:17.554 --> 02:19.389
<i>of being able to work with other people.</i>

02:19.472 --> 02:22.684
<i>I looked at it as this band of outsiders.</i>

02:22.767 --> 02:26.437
One reason why I got into food
was because it was exactly that.

02:26.521 --> 02:31.359
<i>It was, I guess, a form of rebellion</i>
<i>and badass,</i>

02:31.442 --> 02:33.611
<i>right, and badass through your food...</i>

02:33.695 --> 02:36.698
<i>That had this crazy dichotomy</i>
<i>of personality</i>

02:36.781 --> 02:40.451
where they could barely take care
of themselves outside the kitchen,

02:40.535 --> 02:43.913
but inside the kitchen,
they were like special forces,

02:43.997 --> 02:45.248
highly trained assassins.

02:45.331 --> 02:48.334
A little light on the sauce,
but other than that...

02:48.418 --> 02:50.503
-I thought it was good on the sauce.
-Eh.

02:51.170 --> 02:54.132
<i>So why pizza</i>

02:54.716 --> 02:55.925
<i>Growing up as a kid, I was like,</i>

02:56.009 --> 02:58.261
<i>"If I was making pizza,</i>
<i>I'd do it this way."</i>

02:58.970 --> 03:02.515
<i>A friend of mine opened a pizzeria.</i>
<i>I` said, "I wanna try making a pie,"</i>

03:02.599 --> 03:04.392
<i>and, like, I did it my way.</i>

03:04.475 --> 03:07.228
<i>And, he was like,</i>
<i>"Wow, that's a pretty good pizza."</i>

03:09.564 --> 03:13.860
Mark Iacono in Lucali,
I went to it when it was not open yet.

03:13.943 --> 03:16.946
It's part of his shtick
that they're not fully open.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.908
<i>And hearing the story of growing up there,</i>
<i>in the candy shop,</i>

03:19.991 --> 03:22.493
<i>and he'd gone there when it was closing.</i>

03:22.577 --> 03:25.538
<i>He couldn't bear to see that, </i>
<i>so he left his job as a marble cutter</i>

03:25.622 --> 03:28.291
<i>to open this pizzeria</i>
<i>for his neighborhood.</i>

03:30.960 --> 03:32.295
See the difference
when you cook it slow?

03:32.378 --> 03:33.212
Wow. Totally.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.632
This is my favorite pie.

03:36.799 --> 03:38.801
-I tell everyone.
-This, as far as my pie,

03:38.885 --> 03:40.053
-or just--
-This is my favorite pizza.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.764
I voted for this on the top 50
restaurants in the world.

03:42.847 --> 03:44.849
-Again. Yeah!
Thank you.

03:44.933 --> 03:47.060
You would wish that on him?
He's such a nice man.

03:47.143 --> 03:50.480
I have to be truthful.
-I'm here just making pies,

03:50.563 --> 03:53.358
I don't even pay attention
to what goes on out there.

03:53.441 --> 03:56.444
But then it's a debate of
what is actually pizza?

03:56.527 --> 03:59.822
If we were in Naples,
would they consider this pizza?

04:00.907 --> 04:02.200
-I can care less what they consider.
-Thank you.

04:02.283 --> 04:05.578
Right. What if you put barbecue chicken
and cilantro on top of it?

04:05.662 --> 04:07.622
You've had a barbecue chicken pizza
in your day.

04:07.705 --> 04:08.831
No, I haven't.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.875
I stick to the traditional
New York toppings.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.627
Here--
-I try to do them really well.

04:12.710 --> 04:15.546
Is there, so... Where is the outer limit
of toppings for you?

04:15.630 --> 04:17.382
You can throw ramen on top of pizza dough.

04:17.465 --> 04:18.549
-Please, don't.

04:18.633 --> 04:19.634
Nah.  What is that?

04:30.144 --> 04:31.980
This is Maguro tuna.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.441
Hmm.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.445
Wow.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.949
Please just
separate it a little like this and try it.

04:43.032 --> 04:45.243
A little wasabi and soy sauce.

04:45.326 --> 04:48.329
Oh, we're gonna get
destroyed with food, aren't we?

04:49.247 --> 04:50.206
Delicious.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.875
You want a fork?
No.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.754
That was mean.
That was mean of me, Aziz, I'm sorry.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.047
Uh, please come here.

04:58.881 --> 05:01.342
What is going on?
Where did you come from?

05:03.636 --> 05:06.139
I dunno what's happening.
We're supposed to be talking about pizza.

05:06.222 --> 05:07.890
That's right. That's right.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.100
That's a Japanese tip.

05:09.183 --> 05:12.645
If you don't know what's going on,
you just say...

05:13.229 --> 05:16.482
We're going
to surprise you, Chang-san.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.568
Maybe life
is a computer simulation.

05:18.651 --> 05:21.612
-This is us<i> Vanilla Sky</i>-ing ourselves.

05:21.696 --> 05:25.825
First, please eat
this meaty red tuna with white vinegar.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.994
He wants you to--
I am perplexed.

05:28.077 --> 05:29.454
What does he wanna make with this?

05:29.537 --> 05:31.247
I'll be making pizza with this.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.165
Pizza?

05:32.248 --> 05:33.499
Yes, pizza.

05:33.583 --> 05:36.294
I used to make
a tuna-wasabi pizza, believe it or not.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.963
Wow.
-At The Mercer Kitchen.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.131
I don't even, I'm not going--

05:40.214 --> 05:41.966
I thought that was about
some dark days at CPK.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.719
-Yeah.
-California Pizza Kitchens.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.013
Every day,

05:47.096 --> 05:49.724
the taste of tuna from the Japanese sea
can change every day.

05:49.807 --> 05:51.726
Can we get to the pizza though?

05:53.102 --> 05:54.520
All right, let's cook the pizza.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.573
<i>So the pizza we're</i>
<i>about to have is all Japanese.</i>

06:05.656 --> 06:07.533
<i>Every element is from Japan.</i>

06:18.419 --> 06:22.507
Now what else is special
about this pizza isn't the tomato sauce.

06:22.590 --> 06:23.841
It's mayonnaise.

06:23.925 --> 06:24.801
Mayonnaise?

06:26.052 --> 06:28.221
What?

06:28.304 --> 06:31.140
What's going on?

06:31.224 --> 06:34.936
The sauce
is original mayonnaise and, uh, corn.

06:35.019 --> 06:36.062
Corn?

06:36.145 --> 06:38.022
Pizza, but sushi.

06:38.940 --> 06:45.238
This is this one. This is this one.
Please, together.

06:45.321 --> 06:47.532
Oh, my God,
that's fucking delicious.

06:47.615 --> 06:50.076
A lot of wasabi, okay?

06:53.496 --> 06:56.415
I didn't even know, like,
that you had this stuff.

06:56.499 --> 07:00.086
But I also understand, that this is
a very different Japanese mentality

07:00.169 --> 07:02.922
-of you wanting to do more, different.
-Yes, I know.

07:03.005 --> 07:06.092
I don't like fusion. Separate.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.303
How you can say that's not fusion...

07:09.387 --> 07:11.055
Wait, what's happening?

07:11.139 --> 07:13.266
I really don't consider this fusion.

07:13.349 --> 07:15.560
This uses Japanese ingredients.

07:16.394 --> 07:19.897
I like this. Very Donald Trump of you.
Alternative facts.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.192
The reason he combined this is

07:23.276 --> 07:25.528
'cause it's, like, for you,
you're eating sushi.

07:25.611 --> 07:26.612
Yeah.

07:26.696 --> 07:32.410
When I thought about how
to eat tasty tuna on a delicious pizza,

07:32.493 --> 07:34.245
I thought about sushi
and made it that way.

07:34.829 --> 07:38.332
You realize that every pizza
is a living thing. Each one is different.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.250
Yes.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.545
Like snowflakes. But you can eat them.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.386
<i>Can we just draw</i>
<i>the line right now?</i>

07:50.470 --> 07:51.304
<i>So you--</i>

07:51.387 --> 07:52.555
For all of America...

07:52.638 --> 07:55.558
It's that sauce and cheese.
Sauce and cheese and dough.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.977
Let's nip it in the bud.
I'm tired of the arguing.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.437
So let's just say this.

07:59.520 --> 08:04.358
Anything else that's not sauce and cheese
is flatbread.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.110
Yeah.
What about for you?

08:06.194 --> 08:08.779
The first time you ever made me a pizza,
it had mapo tofu on it.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.657
-It did. It was delicious.
-It was delicious.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.075
I know you'll say
it's not a pizza,

08:13.159 --> 08:16.329
but one of those places that put
salad on a pizza. They cook the dough...

08:16.412 --> 08:18.414
Seems like a great thing
to eat salad on top of.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.250
When you say salad, are you talking
about arugula sprinkled on the...

08:22.919 --> 08:25.254
How about Chicago?
Have you done Chicago

08:25.338 --> 08:26.297
I like it.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.256
-Yeah.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.549
-Yeah.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.761
It's a casserole in a baked edible crust.

08:33.137 --> 08:37.183
I think New Haven pizza, as a community,
has the best pizza in America.

08:37.266 --> 08:38.518
Have you spent time up there--

08:38.601 --> 08:40.478
-I still have not made it there.
Oh, my gosh.

08:40.561 --> 08:44.482
It's a surprising statement.
I understand, but you gotta check it out.

08:44.565 --> 08:48.110
You know what? All right.
I'll take your word for it.

09:00.164 --> 09:02.375
<i>Good morning,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

09:02.458 --> 09:03.918
<i>welcome aboard the...</i>

09:04.001 --> 09:06.837
<i>Brooklyn was an amazing place</i>
<i>to grow up.</i>

09:06.921 --> 09:08.548
<i>There was just so much to do.</i>

09:08.631 --> 09:11.592
<i>It was very adventurous,</i>
<i>believe it or not.</i>

09:11.676 --> 09:15.388
As a young kid, going into all
the neighborhoods, it was like <i>Tom Sawyer.</i>

09:15.471 --> 09:16.847
Like we were running away from home.

09:18.266 --> 09:21.811
<i>I'm so closed-minded, you know,</i>
<i>New York, New York, New York.</i>

09:21.894 --> 09:27.692
<i>A lot of people recommend pizzerias to me</i>
<i>and, for the most part, they fall short.</i>

09:27.775 --> 09:30.861
So now I'm a little leery
about making these trips.

09:31.988 --> 09:35.032
<i>I gotta step up my pizza game, my travels.</i>

09:36.742 --> 09:39.787
<i>When people speak of Connecticut pizza,</i>

09:39.870 --> 09:43.457
<i>they only mention two places:</i>
<i>Pepe's and Sally's.</i>

09:46.502 --> 09:48.963
My grandfather, he had this headdress,

09:49.046 --> 09:50.798
and he would have his pizzas
on his headdress,

09:50.881 --> 09:52.925
and he would go around selling his pizzas.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.052
Wait, he'd transport pizzas on his head?

09:55.136 --> 09:56.846
-On his head, yeah.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.600
<i>My grandfather</i>
<i>was the first one in New Haven</i>

10:00.683 --> 10:03.936
<i>to have a dine-in pizza restaurant.</i>
<i>Frank Pepe's.</i>

10:05.605 --> 10:08.190
-This is a coal fire.
Yep.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.735
This is open hearth.
It's all open inside.

10:10.818 --> 10:13.529
Wow.
-This oven was actually a bread baker.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.114
This was a bread oven?
-Right.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.408
-You could fit a lot of pizzas in there.
-Oh, yeah.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.369
-We're gonna make some pizza.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.831
All right. It looks like you guys
use a really wet dough.

10:23.914 --> 10:27.293
It is. My grandfather, back in the day,
he never had refrigeration.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.420
<i>Right.</i>
<i>-So the dough was out all the time.</i>

10:29.503 --> 10:31.297
<i>I love the rustic look of it.</i>

10:31.380 --> 10:34.675
It's not cookie-cutter perfect.
-It shouldn't be.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.302
We use imported tomatoes from Italy.

10:36.385 --> 10:38.262
-Uh, I can't tell you that.

10:38.346 --> 10:41.599
All right.  You'd have to kill me.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.935
-Currently eight.

10:45.019 --> 10:48.147
Stay out of Brooklyn.
I don't want no competition.

10:49.398 --> 10:52.151
Wow, look at that.
I'm starting to believe the hype.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.404
<i></i>
<i>-I think we'll make the white clam.</i>

10:55.488 --> 10:57.657
<i>I've been hearing</i>
<i>so much about this pie.</i>

10:57.740 --> 11:00.284
<i>As the story goes,</i>
<i>there used to be two houses in front,</i>

11:00.368 --> 11:02.495
so there was a little alleyway
to get back here.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.955
There was a guy in the alleyway,
he used to cut clams on the half-shell,

11:05.039 --> 11:06.749
called Nick, he was a bookie.

11:06.832 --> 11:10.211
He came in, he goes, "Do you ever think
of putting them on a pizza?"

11:10.294 --> 11:11.337
Really?

11:11.420 --> 11:13.381
Put them on the pizza
and that was the end of that.

11:13.464 --> 11:16.509
All right.
You put a lot of clams on the pie.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.386
No, it's about normal.

11:18.469 --> 11:21.514
A little oregano,
grated cheese, fresh garlic.

11:21.597 --> 11:23.015
And that's it?
-That's it.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.975
Stand back.
-Yeah.

11:25.976 --> 11:27.812
You gonna start with the clam?
-Yeah.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.438
I'll start with the plain.

11:34.610 --> 11:36.320
I think my favorite so far
is the clam pie.

11:37.154 --> 11:38.906
I really couldn't envision
how it would taste

11:38.989 --> 11:40.908
and I'm really surprised
at how good it is.

11:40.991 --> 11:43.953
One guy once told me, uh,
anyone who puts seafood on a pizza

11:44.036 --> 11:45.162
should get slapped in the head.

11:45.913 --> 11:48.374
-I disagree. We all--
-I'd like to slap him in the head now,

11:48.457 --> 11:49.834
after eating that.

11:50.584 --> 11:52.670
<i>So how do you feel about pizza now?</i>

11:52.753 --> 11:56.465
Do you think it's more of an Italian thing
or an American thing?

11:57.842 --> 12:01.095
Back in the day,
this was a very strong Italian...

12:01.178 --> 12:03.514
-Predominantly Italian neighborhood.

12:04.473 --> 12:07.935
A lot of the older ones passed on
or moved to Florida.

12:08.018 --> 12:12.022
How the Italian culture
evolved over the years...

12:12.106 --> 12:17.361
It really kind of morphed into something.
It's kind of losing its--

12:17.445 --> 12:19.029
-It's watered down.
-Yeah, it's watered down.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.739
-It's losing its--
-It has, yeah.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.868
-We're probably, like, the last--

12:23.951 --> 12:27.121
Yeah, the last breed, you know?

12:27.204 --> 12:31.000
We're no longer Italian-Americans,
we're American-Italians now.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.334
I agree, I agree. Uh...

12:49.935 --> 12:52.980
We are the oldest pizzeria in the world
by the same family.

12:53.063 --> 12:56.317
And we look it. 92 years.

12:59.195 --> 13:04.116
My grandfather, Anthony Pero,
brought pizza to America.

13:04.200 --> 13:08.704
It's been the same recipe from day one.
You don't fix something that isn't broken.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.458
What could I... Cookie, could you
get a good pizza in California?

13:12.541 --> 13:13.876
-No.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.046
No! That's kinda what I thought she'd say.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.298
How do you feel about a Chicago pie?

13:19.381 --> 13:21.258
-No!

13:21.342 --> 13:23.677
No! No!

13:23.761 --> 13:27.556
You see, you're asking these questions
and you haven't even eaten our pizza.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.184
If you ate the pizza,
you wouldn't ask these questions.

13:30.267 --> 13:31.936
See what I'm saying,
why you have to talk to her.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.687
I grew up in New Haven,
Connecticut,

13:33.771 --> 13:37.066
where it is known to have
the best pizza, Pepe's.

13:37.149 --> 13:40.069
And I will say Totonno's
is by far the best pizza.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.570
You should come here in the summer.

13:41.654 --> 13:46.075
You have to wait an hour and a half
around the block in a line to get here.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.410
-Pineapple and chicken.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.120
Pineapple! Pineapple!

13:50.204 --> 13:52.373
Ham, pineapple and chicken.

13:52.456 --> 13:55.209
-And clams.
Why no clams?

13:56.126 --> 13:59.672
You want clams? Have spaghetti and clams,
that's where it belongs.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.718
<i>That's where clams belong,</i>
<i>on spaghetti.</i>

14:06.637 --> 14:08.889
<i> And now, </i>
<i>a message from our sponsors.</i>

14:08.973 --> 14:10.849
<i>Are you ready to celebrate</i>

14:10.933 --> 14:14.520

<i>plus a salad of iceberg lettuce,</i>

14:58.355 --> 15:00.024
<i>Order now!</i>

15:01.692 --> 15:03.277
I think New York is pizza.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.530
It became a food for the world
when it came to New York, right?

15:06.614 --> 15:08.866
I think it went from Italian
to Italian-American,

15:08.949 --> 15:10.618
and now it's at American, you know.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.953
I think there's all three of those things.

15:13.037 --> 15:15.247
Question I have is, what's the best pizza?

15:16.165 --> 15:18.876
Right? I would rather eat this
than Neapolitan style, so...

15:18.959 --> 15:20.336
Just because it's from Italy

15:20.419 --> 15:22.379
-doesn't mean it's better.
-Thank you.

15:22.963 --> 15:25.174
And that's what I say about pizza.

15:26.759 --> 15:30.220
They invented it,
we Italian-Americans perfected it.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.941
I am Antonio Pace.

15:42.691 --> 15:45.611
The President of
the Association Verace Pizza Napoletana.

15:47.696 --> 15:52.201
<i>Our association was founded</i>
<i>32 years ago with a specific purpose:</i>

15:52.284 --> 15:56.121
<i>Guaranteeing the authority of pizza</i>
<i>to the City of Naples.</i>

15:56.205 --> 16:00.751
And to spread all over the world
the right way to make a Neapolitan pizza.

16:03.087 --> 16:06.757
<i>For us, Neapolitan pizza</i>
<i>is a philosophy of life.</i>

16:08.509 --> 16:13.263
When we were making pizzas,
you were still fighting with Indians.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.250
So, you've been to Italy before?
Never in Naples.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.334
Never in Naples.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.961
It's this way.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.922
We're in the back streets of Naples.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.257
-I love this.
I know.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.718
I can't quite get over how pretty it is.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.304
I feel like there's an almost obsession

16:54.388 --> 16:58.809
with the idea of Neapolitan pizza
being the first pizza

16:58.892 --> 17:00.185
or the place that pizza comes from.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.854
-It's a romantic story.
-Yeah.

17:01.937 --> 17:06.400
<i>I don't buy so deeply into the idea </i>
<i>of bread topped with things </i>

17:06.483 --> 17:09.695
came from one place, one time.

17:10.279 --> 17:13.490
I feel as soon as humans figured out
how to mix wheat and water,

17:13.574 --> 17:15.701
they probably started putting shit on it
to try to make it taste better.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.579
<i>But it is their culture.</i>
<i>Right.</i>

17:18.662 --> 17:20.414
<i>So, I guess</i>
<i>we have to respect it.</i>

17:20.497 --> 17:25.210
Wish I'd taken the line of respecting it,
but now I'm the asshole criticizing it.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.171
Look at this.

17:27.254 --> 17:29.757
-Look at these.
-They look like heirlooms.

17:32.968 --> 17:35.429
Give me one basket.
One basket?

17:35.512 --> 17:37.556
Yeah, and two of these.

17:37.639 --> 17:38.891
-No. Two, no.

17:38.974 --> 17:40.976
Two basket.
It's a particular tomato.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.853
-All right, two baskets.
-Yeah.

17:44.563 --> 17:50.778
<i>Our region made tomatoes</i>
<i>an element of gastronomic culture.</i>

17:50.861 --> 17:53.947
So San Marzano tomato is the ideal one.

17:56.366 --> 18:01.080
The Neapolitan pizza came together
in its glorious state

18:01.163 --> 18:05.876
with the use of tomato as food.

18:08.003 --> 18:11.507
<i>That is </i>
<i>the mark of Verace Pizza Napoletana.</i>

18:11.590 --> 18:15.552
It certifies the quality of our pizza.

18:19.264 --> 18:23.393
That mark certifies
that our product is made with

18:23.477 --> 18:26.188
mozzarella fior di latte Campana.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.816
Our dough is made according to regulation.

18:28.899 --> 18:31.777
It looks super wet.
Yes, very delicate.

18:31.860 --> 18:35.489
You just need
3 or 4 ingredients for Neapolitan pizza.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.620
Those are the tomatoes
you bought across the street.

18:41.703 --> 18:44.706
This is classic Margherita.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.667
-Parmigiano.
Parmigiano<i>.</i>

18:46.750 --> 18:48.127
Makes everything delicious.

18:48.210 --> 18:51.797
Is it okay to put parmesan cheese
on a Neapolitan pizza?

18:52.381 --> 18:54.383
In every pizza, parmesan, yes.

18:55.592 --> 18:57.427
<i>How long does it take</i>
<i>you to cook a pizza?</i>

18:57.511 --> 19:00.889
<i>50 or 60 seconds.</i>

19:00.973 --> 19:02.724
<i>Wow, that's fast.</i>
<i>That's fast.</i>

19:06.353 --> 19:09.022
Wow. Just like that.

19:12.151 --> 19:15.988
We start a visual check.

19:16.071 --> 19:18.657
The first thing is breaking the crust

19:18.740 --> 19:21.285
and see if inside
there is an alveolar structure.

19:21.368 --> 19:25.038
In this case, the pizza has fairly risen.

19:26.915 --> 19:29.042
We're about to eat
our first pizza in Naples.

19:29.126 --> 19:34.173
Then we should smell it,
even if it is not really polite.

19:34.256 --> 19:40.846
The smell of the crust
should be a fragrance of fresh bread,

19:41.471 --> 19:43.682
without strong smell of yeast.

19:46.768 --> 19:49.897
So, if you smell the yeast
or the fermentation, it's no good?

19:49.980 --> 19:52.774
Right! If it has
a sour smell, it is not good.

19:52.858 --> 19:58.280
The way to eat pizza
is fold it like a wallet.

19:58.363 --> 20:04.453
After the first bite, you feel
the dough melt in your mouth.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.247
I love the pizza.
I'm very into this.

20:07.331 --> 20:11.376
I tried a lot of Neapolitan pizza.
I've never had anything this good.

20:14.588 --> 20:15.505
Maybe we should get another pie?

20:15.589 --> 20:16.965
-Yeah.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.133
All right, great.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.635
Can we get one more?

20:26.183 --> 20:31.480

21:09.518 --> 21:13.146

He is such a mogul.

21:15.732 --> 21:18.568
-Oh, my God!
-Hi, Chef.

21:18.652 --> 21:19.820
How are you?
-Sorry, I'm so late.

21:19.903 --> 21:23.573
We can make pizza at midnight,
for breakfast, anytime.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.286
You don't make pizza yet
in your restaurant?

21:27.369 --> 21:28.495
No.

21:28.578 --> 21:32.582
I want to, but I think a lot of my friends
would be upset at me.

21:32.666 --> 21:36.169
You know how upset they were at me.
They say, "An Austrian making pizza?

21:36.253 --> 21:37.671
What the heck?"

21:37.754 --> 21:44.177
If we wanna make pizza the way they did
in Naples 300 years ago, it's okay.

21:44.261 --> 21:48.515
I'm not saying it's not good or whatever,
but it's just not our style.

21:48.598 --> 21:52.144
So, do you think authenticity
is overrated in certain things?

21:52.227 --> 21:55.605
Authenticity, I love it
when you go to a place.

21:55.689 --> 21:58.525
You know, when I'm in Italy,
I wanna taste Italian food.

21:58.608 --> 22:01.903
But America is a melting pot of cultures.

22:01.987 --> 22:06.533
So, I think there's nothing wrong with
melting some of the cuisines together.

22:06.616 --> 22:10.245
So, in the old times,
there was a guy named Johnny Carson.

22:10.329 --> 22:13.165
-He was what Jimmy Fallon does today.
-Yeah.

22:13.248 --> 22:16.335
-I'm not that young.
-Okay.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.628
-I remember Johnny Carson's last episode.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.590
Little something here, it's nice.

22:21.673 --> 22:22.966
Can I try it, if you like?

22:23.050 --> 22:25.552
Please sit down,
and we'll give you a Pinacolonic.

22:27.262 --> 22:29.306
<i>Johnny Carson used to</i>
<i>come on Friday nights</i>

22:29.389 --> 22:30.849
<i>and order 10, 12 pizzas to go.</i>

22:30.932 --> 22:32.476
Sit in the sun today?

22:32.559 --> 22:36.605
-We're going to Spago.
-Spago!

22:36.688 --> 22:38.398
<i>After the third or fourth time,</i>
<i>I said, </i>

22:38.482 --> 22:40.317
"Johnny, you're having
another pizza party."

22:40.400 --> 22:42.402
He says, "No, I put them in my freezer."

22:42.486 --> 22:45.447
I said, "What the hell?
You put my pizzas in the freezer?

22:45.530 --> 22:46.823
I'm not gonna make
pizzas anymore for you."

22:46.907 --> 22:49.951
He says, "No, it's as good
as the regular one here."

22:50.035 --> 22:52.704
I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
I was so upset.

22:52.788 --> 22:56.875
Finally, I tried it myself,
and I said, "You know what?

22:56.958 --> 23:00.337
Maybe it's not quite as good as ours
we have at Spago, but it's pretty good."

23:00.420 --> 23:03.215
<i>So, we started doing...</i>
<i>-Johnny Carson is behind...</i>

23:03.298 --> 23:04.758
<i>Behind the frozen pizzas. </i>

23:04.841 --> 23:09.387
But he didn't sign a deal with me
so he didn't get any royalties, thank God.

23:09.471 --> 23:12.099
Let's do our smoked salmon pizza.
-I wanna see that.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.517
Yeah.

23:13.600 --> 23:17.437
You think we've lost craftsmanship though?
If we're sacrificing creativity?

23:17.521 --> 23:21.108
Creativity is good by somebody
who is a good craftsman.

23:21.191 --> 23:25.779
If you know the basics,
if you know your profession really well,

23:25.862 --> 23:29.116
then you can navigate
and try other things.

23:29.199 --> 23:32.160
If you were from Italy,
there is no way you could have done this.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.411
I know.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.330
Because you're an outsider,
you're allowed to do this.

23:35.413 --> 23:36.289
Exactly.

23:36.373 --> 23:39.626
My Italian friends would have come
and said, "What the heck is that?"

23:40.585 --> 23:43.547
You have to put a little caviar on top.

23:44.422 --> 23:48.343
But it makes people upset
when you change and challenge convention.

23:48.426 --> 23:51.304
You know, people hate change.

23:51.388 --> 23:54.015
-No.

23:54.099 --> 23:57.269
-As long as I live, I always will do that.

23:57.352 --> 23:59.229
And at the end of the day,

23:59.312 --> 24:02.065
as long as you get
enough other people to come

24:02.149 --> 24:05.068
who'll say, "Wow! This is
really interesting," it's fine.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.903
I mean, just talking to you now,
I'm like,

24:06.987 --> 24:09.072
"Oh, my gosh!
There's so many similarities."

24:09.156 --> 24:11.950
Part of it is
there's a rebellious streak in you. Right?

24:12.033 --> 24:13.493
Yeah. No, totally.

24:13.577 --> 24:17.038
Still today, still today, I think,

24:17.122 --> 24:20.917
in a way, for me, I'm more like
the coach now than the player.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.043
No matter how good you are,

24:22.127 --> 24:26.840
you won't wanna play basketball
when you're 45 or 48 or 50 years old.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.675
I use the same analogy for myself
all the time.

24:28.758 --> 24:29.593
Yeah?

24:29.676 --> 24:33.388
Yeah. I can't believe it.
I'm a Korean-American version of you.

24:33.471 --> 24:34.306
Really?

24:38.602 --> 24:40.520
<i>Pizza is a disk of dough.</i>

24:40.604 --> 24:42.981
<i>Toppings must be picked</i>
<i>with a gastronomic culture</i>

24:43.064 --> 24:45.066
and sense of taste.

24:46.234 --> 24:48.862
<i>When we wrote our guidelines,</i>

24:48.945 --> 24:51.698
<i>fior di latte cheese was having a decline.</i>

24:51.781 --> 24:56.203
That's why I,
when I wrote the first guidelines,

24:56.286 --> 24:58.663
I added buffalo mozzarella as an option.

25:07.589 --> 25:12.344
Wow! What makes
the buffalo milk from Campania so special?

25:12.427 --> 25:15.931
In Campania,
we started breeding buffaloes

25:16.014 --> 25:19.142
around the years 1000-1100.

25:19.226 --> 25:20.852
In 1000 A.D.?

25:20.936 --> 25:21.811
Yes.

25:21.895 --> 25:24.773
<i>The animals came from</i>
<i>Northern Africa and Asia,</i>

25:24.856 --> 25:27.567
<i>brought to Italy by the Normans.</i>

25:33.198 --> 25:36.409
<i>We are those who know</i>
<i>how to make the real mozzarella di bufala.</i>

25:36.993 --> 25:41.581
There are good industries, of course,

25:41.665 --> 25:44.584
but artisans have something more.

25:49.547 --> 25:51.508
-Okay.

25:51.591 --> 25:53.009
All right.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.721
Don't fold.
-I'm trying.

25:57.305 --> 25:59.724
<i>Around the year 1000,</i>

25:59.808 --> 26:02.811
<i>the monastery of Capua</i>

26:02.894 --> 26:08.650
<i>tried to curdle their milk</i>

26:08.733 --> 26:11.611
<i>and make cheese.</i>

26:11.695 --> 26:13.905
<i>They tried to cook it</i>

26:13.989 --> 26:19.536
<i>and noticed that it started straining.</i>

26:19.619 --> 26:26.084
<i>And they found that the product was tasty.</i>

26:28.336 --> 26:30.922
Easy, just twist it up
into a perfect braid.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.173
Go for it.

26:32.257 --> 26:33.842
I think I'm gonna
leave that to the professionals.

26:38.138 --> 26:41.558
Authenticity, in terms of storytelling,
is important to me,

26:41.641 --> 26:45.770
but authenticity in food is not a thing.

26:45.854 --> 26:48.940
And it's like, whoever gave you
that authentic food experience,

26:49.024 --> 26:51.484
probably has never thought
about themselves as authentic.

26:52.694 --> 26:56.698
<i>There's a reductive quality</i>
<i>to saying that something's authentic.</i>

27:09.085 --> 27:10.086
<i>Some things become special</i>

27:10.170 --> 27:12.464
<i>when you try and find your own way.</i>

27:12.547 --> 27:17.010
<i>The starting point</i>
<i>was to do something authentic</i>

27:17.093 --> 27:19.596
<i>by not trying to be authentic.</i>

27:19.679 --> 27:23.350
<i>I think that's a big flaw</i>
<i>in the world of pizza, particularly.</i>

27:23.433 --> 27:24.642
That is the most Italian thing,

27:24.726 --> 27:26.936
but if you only look at
how it used to be done,

27:27.020 --> 27:28.980
or how it's supposed to be done,

27:29.064 --> 27:30.565
you don't allow yourself
to move it forward.

27:31.232 --> 27:34.027
<i>If you do an authentic Neapolitan pizza,</i>

27:34.110 --> 27:38.365
you must import buffalo mozzarella
from the Campania region.

27:38.448 --> 27:40.408
-Now, who makes these rules...

27:40.492 --> 27:44.788
...has an obvious interest
in the export of buffalo mozzarella.

27:45.830 --> 27:49.542
So, how is it that you can be told
that freshness is everything?

27:49.626 --> 27:52.337
That in Naples, they say
you have 24 different mozzarellas

27:52.420 --> 27:54.672
for every hour after it's been produced.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.007
But you still
you need to buy it in import,

27:56.091 --> 27:57.675
and it's gonna take you seven days
to get it to Copenhagen.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.052
It didn't make sense to me.

27:59.636 --> 28:02.347
<i>If I need freshness,</i>
<i>we'll need to make it ourselves.</i>

28:02.430 --> 28:03.264
<i> You taught yourself</i>
<i>how to make it?</i>

28:05.225 --> 28:06.851
-Amazing.
-A lot of YouTube,

28:06.935 --> 28:10.522
<i>a lot of research, a lot of experimenting,</i>
<i>a lot of shit mozzarella.</i>

28:10.605 --> 28:13.024
Then, last year, we got cows.

28:16.986 --> 28:19.572
<i>We got our own milk</i>
<i>from our own herd of Jersey cows.</i>

28:20.156 --> 28:21.950
The mozzarella just...

28:22.033 --> 28:23.993
Like magical dust on it.

28:24.077 --> 28:24.911
<i>It was crazy.</i>

28:26.204 --> 28:27.872
<i>Much, much better.</i>

28:27.956 --> 28:30.792
-You're a big-ass dreamer.
-Yeah, I am.

28:30.875 --> 28:32.460
That's what I've always admired about you.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.421
<i>You just fucking go for it.</i>

28:34.504 --> 28:37.966
<i>I always make fun of my friends</i>
<i>that are Italian chefs that</i>

28:38.049 --> 28:39.884
you can't fuck with
anything that's Italian.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.178
And that tradition,

28:42.262 --> 28:46.182
that, like, fear of doing
something that is not really Italian,

28:46.266 --> 28:49.352
which, as an immigrant, for me
was a big deal.

28:49.436 --> 28:52.021
<i>I so wanted to be Italian,</i>
<i>wanted to feel Italian.</i>

28:52.105 --> 28:55.650
I want... I was like, "You know what?
I'm mixed. My mom is Norwegian.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.652
-I'm born in Italy, my father is Italian."
-Yeah.

28:57.736 --> 28:58.903
I'm a big mix. I don't care.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.198
<i>This idea of </i>
<i>everything is in a certain way</i>

29:02.282 --> 29:03.533
<i>and it should be kept that way,</i>

29:03.616 --> 29:07.620
has really been, like,
provoking me to tinker,

29:07.704 --> 29:10.331
<i>to say, "I think this can be done better."</i>

29:12.876 --> 29:16.755
I hate being on camera, and being like,
"Oh, that's so delicious." I'm like...

29:16.838 --> 29:18.590
'cause it seems so lame,

29:18.673 --> 29:20.759
-but it's fucking delicious.
-Right.

29:24.095 --> 29:26.055
<i>Our pizza is sourdough-based.</i> <i>Like, the traditional pizza is on yeast,</i>

29:28.183 --> 29:31.186
and it is a fast fermentation,
it's a fast food.

29:31.269 --> 29:34.773
If you do a real Neapolitan pizza,
you will probably have

29:34.856 --> 29:36.691
the outside, the crust on it, be bigger...

29:36.775 --> 29:38.109
-More bubbles.
-...more open. Yeah.

29:38.193 --> 29:40.236
But what I think is a huge factor is

29:40.320 --> 29:44.574
when you open this, if you smell this,
it doesn't smell of yeast.

29:44.657 --> 29:48.203
And there is no pizza that has yeast in it
where you cannot smell the yeast.

29:48.286 --> 29:51.831
And for me, it's like, you put a...
you put a cap on it.

29:51.915 --> 29:55.084
It's not possible to, flavor-wise,
develop something that is not that thing.

29:55.168 --> 29:57.420
It's funny to me
because Italians should be

29:57.504 --> 30:00.590
proponents of the sourdough method,
and not the yeast method.

30:00.673 --> 30:02.509
-That doesn't make sense.
-Yeah.

30:03.092 --> 30:06.054
But in that trade-off
between flavor and texture,

30:06.137 --> 30:07.889
this is our choice.

30:09.516 --> 30:12.811
Think about all
the bad Italian restaurants in America.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.187
Yeah.
-Think about

30:14.270 --> 30:17.482
all the restaurants that open up
in New York City to this day.

30:17.565 --> 30:18.691
How many are Italian?

30:19.275 --> 30:21.486
Just, Italian never goes out of style.

30:21.569 --> 30:25.406
I think that Italian-American food
is a source of anger for you.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.825
You're jealous of the success...

30:26.908 --> 30:29.118
-Yes. Jealous.
-...and acceptance

30:29.202 --> 30:32.121
that Italian-American cuisine
receives in America.

30:32.205 --> 30:36.584
And it's not really anger,
it's just sort of rage that, uh...

30:37.335 --> 30:40.964
I don't understand why Italian food,
Italian-American food,

30:41.047 --> 30:43.174
is so beloved in this country,

30:43.258 --> 30:45.093
-more than anything else.

30:45.176 --> 30:46.970
-Of course I've had it.
-It's very delicious.

30:47.053 --> 30:49.722
What about bad pizza?
What about Domino's Pizza?

30:49.806 --> 30:51.015
Did you ever have...

30:51.099 --> 30:54.644
I grew up in the suburbs
and Domino's was the pizza of my youth.

30:54.727 --> 30:56.980
It's good.
It's pretty good right now.

30:57.063 --> 30:58.064
What?

30:58.147 --> 30:59.816
-Not the one I had. Is it because
you know more about pizza now?

31:01.651 --> 31:03.778
No, no. I was really, really disappointed.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.446
Don't be upset at me.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.866
No, I'm not.
-But I order Domino's,

31:07.949 --> 31:11.202
you know, occasionally,
once a couple of months.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.787
I'll send you pies more often.

31:18.167 --> 31:20.003
Delivery.

31:20.587 --> 31:22.463
What do you want on your pizza, man?

31:22.547 --> 31:23.590
Why don't you get--
-Get a plain pie.

31:23.673 --> 31:26.342
You get a plain pie and then
make one of your insane creations.

31:26.426 --> 31:27.260
Don't be jerks.

31:27.343 --> 31:28.845
We'll wait till the pizza's here
to be jerks.

31:28.928 --> 31:31.139
Do you want hand-tossed,
thin crust, Brooklyn style?

31:31.222 --> 31:32.515
Brooklyn style?
-Yeah, thin crust one.

31:32.599 --> 31:35.435
Let's go with the thin-crust
Brooklyn style.

31:40.273 --> 31:41.357
<i> Hi.</i>

31:41.441 --> 31:45.278
<i>I'm Walter Green,</i>
<i>a New York City-based human,</i>

31:45.361 --> 31:46.905
<i>who sometimes eats unhealthy food</i>

31:46.988 --> 31:49.532
<i>and then writes about it</i>
<i>for small amounts of money.</i>

31:49.616 --> 31:53.536
<i>I also happen to enjoy eating</i>
<i>unhealthy food in my personal life.</i>

31:53.620 --> 31:56.080
<i>So, when this production</i>
<i>offered me the opportunity</i>

31:56.164 --> 31:58.833
<i>to attend the world-famous Pizza Expo</i>
<i>in Las Vegas,</i>

31:58.917 --> 32:00.752
<i>I jumped at the chance.</i>

32:00.835 --> 32:03.713
<i>Please, sit down, strap in,</i>
<i>and join me</i>

32:03.796 --> 32:06.174
<i>as I dive directly into</i>
<i>the heart of the pizza industrial complex.</i>

32:11.429 --> 32:12.764
<i> I took a hit of acid.</i>

32:12.847 --> 32:15.475
<i>I've been awake for 24 hours straight.</i>

32:16.643 --> 32:18.686
We have some food professionals,

32:18.770 --> 32:20.772
some pizza inventors.

32:22.273 --> 32:23.483
Pizza!

32:47.465 --> 32:50.009
Is the goal just to find
more customers

32:50.093 --> 32:51.219
That's the game.

32:51.302 --> 32:52.345
<i>Amazing.</i>
<i>Sales.</i>

32:57.266 --> 33:00.353
We got people going up for deals,
talking price per unit.

33:15.034 --> 33:19.706
Where it really became as big as this
is in the mid '80s,

33:19.789 --> 33:22.917
<i>when pizza, really, as an</i>
<i>independent group, really took off.</i>

33:23.001 --> 33:26.045
One order of tomato sauce coming up!

33:28.381 --> 33:29.632
<i>Fun to play with, not to eat!</i>

33:37.598 --> 33:40.810
-Mmm, you're delicious!

33:47.442 --> 33:50.278
There's a rat in there.
Just kidding. There's not a rat.

33:51.738 --> 33:55.908
But it could fit a human.
It could definitely fit a human body.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.873
David Chang. Yeah, two pies.

34:01.956 --> 34:02.957
Thank you, sir.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.709
Man, you got something...

34:07.128 --> 34:10.089
This is my Domino's order.

34:10.173 --> 34:12.508
Do you offer free points
for free pizza?

34:12.592 --> 34:14.635
Just... Hey.
Just stop with your fucking jokes.

34:14.719 --> 34:20.016
So, this is a thin crust pizza
with alfredo sauce, onions and bacon.

34:20.099 --> 34:21.559
It's like an Alsatian pie.

34:23.144 --> 34:25.188
Let's go for it.

34:25.271 --> 34:27.732
-Oh, squares, they've cut it into.
Really?

34:32.987 --> 34:34.781
Come on, you don't like it?
It's not bad for eating.

34:34.864 --> 34:37.033
-No. No, I like it. It's not pizza.
-Yeah.

34:37.116 --> 34:38.409
It's not pizza.
What do you mean?

34:38.993 --> 34:40.495
It's not pizza.

34:40.578 --> 34:42.705
I wanna try the pizza.
All right.

34:42.789 --> 34:43.998
Wow, look at that.

34:44.082 --> 34:46.209
This is the
Brooklyn-style Domino's.

34:47.418 --> 34:50.296
You've just done a side-by-side.
And?

34:51.172 --> 34:53.674
No. No, no, no.

34:53.758 --> 34:54.967
I mean, I'd much rather have your pie.

34:55.051 --> 34:57.220
I'm not trying to be disgraceful here.

34:57.303 --> 34:59.138
I don't think the appeal
of this pizza has to do

34:59.222 --> 35:01.015
with its flavor, or its texture,
or its composition.

35:01.099 --> 35:04.352
I think it has to do with its availability
and its price point.

35:04.435 --> 35:07.105
Again, it's like,
it's what you grew up on.

35:07.188 --> 35:09.524
I went to a real, authentic
Chinese restaurant.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.859
And I found it terrible.

35:12.443 --> 35:15.655
To me it was that, it wasn't
something that I was used to.

35:15.738 --> 35:19.033
This is what they grew up on.
This is what they had access to.

35:19.117 --> 35:24.080
But... I still, sort of, weirdly,
celebrate this too.

35:25.164 --> 35:27.583
It's pretty weird.

35:27.667 --> 35:30.670
No, no. I wanna do it in...

35:30.753 --> 35:32.171
I'm not gonna do this.

35:33.297 --> 35:37.051
<i>I'm one of the biggest snobs </i>
<i>you've ever met. But I hate elitism.</i>

35:37.135 --> 35:39.137
And snobs in general.

35:39.220 --> 35:42.598
I guess what I hate is being told
that I can't like something.

35:42.682 --> 35:44.517
"Oh, you can't do this."

35:44.600 --> 35:46.602
"Fuck you, I'm definitely gonna do this."

35:50.106 --> 35:53.734
<i>I think the main reason I like Domino's</i>
<i>is because</i>

35:53.818 --> 35:57.655
I'm being told by the culinary snob patrol
that I can't like it.

35:59.240 --> 36:02.910
It's not something I eat all the time,
but it reminds me of, like, growing up,

36:02.994 --> 36:05.663
'cause this is literally the pizza
that I grew up eating...

36:05.746 --> 36:07.665
Yeah.

36:07.748 --> 36:09.208
-Northern Virginia. Yeah, Vienna.
-Yeah.

36:11.169 --> 36:15.923
One pepperoni topping goes 30.
Two toppings go 24 pepperonis.

36:16.007 --> 36:16.883
-Yeah.

36:16.966 --> 36:18.301
Three toppings go 18 pepperonis.

36:18.384 --> 36:22.680
So, as more toppings you add,
less quantity you have to put in.

36:22.763 --> 36:24.182
How many combinations can you make?

36:24.265 --> 36:25.308
Thirty-four million.

36:25.391 --> 36:27.977
-Pizza combinations.

36:30.479 --> 36:32.690
<i> This is, like, very exciting</i>
<i>for me to see.</i>

36:32.773 --> 36:35.318
<i>'Cause this is years and years and years</i>

36:35.401 --> 36:39.614
<i>of a lot of people's efforts</i>
<i>to make it as streamlined as possible.</i>

36:42.200 --> 36:44.035
I can no longer taste anything.

36:45.161 --> 36:47.163
You'll probably like this.
Look how this comes in.

36:48.414 --> 36:50.708
It's already cut.
We don't have to cut anything.

36:50.791 --> 36:52.084
That's wild.

36:52.168 --> 36:53.169
So...

36:53.252 --> 36:55.713
Can you even
eat your product anymore?

36:55.796 --> 36:58.090
I can, but I'd rather go
to your restaurant.

36:58.925 --> 37:02.762
This right here, on a Super Bowl Sunday,
probably 300 come out per hour.

37:02.845 --> 37:04.180
Wow!

37:04.263 --> 37:07.058
I love the app.
I love tracking where it's at.

37:07.725 --> 37:11.020
So, how... Are you pressing
so it updates on the app continuously?

37:11.103 --> 37:14.607
No. When the pizza's loaded in the oven,
we kill it on that,

37:14.690 --> 37:16.317
so it comes off the screen, so it's made.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.528
The computer's gonna add the time
that you have the oven setting at to it.

37:19.612 --> 37:20.488
Oh, that's crazy.

37:20.571 --> 37:25.117
And then, when you dispatch there,
it knows that it left in 12 minutes.

37:25.201 --> 37:27.286
So, it sat here for three minutes.

37:27.370 --> 37:28.537
That's what's crazy to me is,

37:28.621 --> 37:31.916
I don't even think
that Domino's is a food company anymore.

37:31.999 --> 37:33.626
-I think of you as a tech company.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.882
<i>You wanna get driver training?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

37:39.966 --> 37:41.842
<i>You're gonna be with Bill,</i>
<i>delivering pizzas.</i>

37:41.926 --> 37:43.219
How are you
Very good.

37:43.302 --> 37:46.347
First thing you do, you get the
order in the bag, get it set, ready to go.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.849
We'll head out the door
and take a slight jog to my truck.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.059
All right.

37:50.142 --> 37:51.560
You here.

37:53.437 --> 37:54.480
Oh, my God.

37:54.563 --> 37:56.107
Seat belts on first.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.193
Safety first.

37:59.277 --> 38:02.947
Can you talk about Franco
Pepe, who broke off from your association?

38:03.030 --> 38:07.618
It is a pleasure for me to
answer this question with this nice story.

38:08.202 --> 38:09.787
<i>Of course, Franco Pepe, okay.</i>

38:09.870 --> 38:13.040
<i>All the famous pizza makers today</i>
<i>started with us.</i>

38:13.124 --> 38:16.043
<i>So I love to say</i>
<i>that they are all our children.</i>

38:16.127 --> 38:19.171
<i>Even if some of them</i>
<i>were not my best work.</i>

38:28.389 --> 38:31.017
We could spend our entire trip
walking on these little streets.

38:31.100 --> 38:33.227
I know.
What do you think of Naples so far?

38:33.311 --> 38:34.687
I'm loving it.

38:34.770 --> 38:36.397
And now we're in Caiazzo?

38:36.480 --> 38:39.442
"Caiazzo?" My Italian.

38:39.525 --> 38:40.359
I gotta work on it.

38:40.443 --> 38:41.777
Yeah. You and me both.

38:43.404 --> 38:46.324
<i>Many people don't believe me,</i>

38:46.407 --> 38:49.535
<i>but I had dreamed of this place.</i>

38:50.119 --> 38:52.204
Where is everybody?
-I don't know.

38:52.288 --> 38:54.540
They're all at his pizzeria.
-They're all... yeah.

38:54.623 --> 38:58.711
Many pizza makers
just add toppings to pizza.

38:58.794 --> 39:01.005
No, in my opinion,

39:01.088 --> 39:04.342
it's in the simplicity
that makes a difference.

39:04.967 --> 39:07.053
Oh, this is it?
-Yeah.

39:07.136 --> 39:09.680
We're here.
This place gotta be good.

39:11.599 --> 39:14.060
When I opened my business in this alley,

39:14.143 --> 39:18.939
<i>the city center was almost abandoned.</i>
<i>All small shops were closing down.</i>

39:19.023 --> 39:23.778
Everyone kept saying to me,
"He's crazy! He's crazy!"

39:26.697 --> 39:30.785
And now, after four years,
many shops have opened again.

39:30.868 --> 39:33.746
Many people have come to eat my pizza.

39:34.663 --> 39:36.957
So, you cook the pie first?

39:37.041 --> 39:41.420
Well, instead of
putting tomato, I only put mozzarella.

39:41.504 --> 39:46.133
<i>Then, when it comes out of the oven,</i>
<i>I put the tomato and a basil reduction.</i>

39:46.217 --> 39:49.428
This was my intuition, an idea of mine.

39:49.512 --> 39:51.680
So when you eat the pizza,

39:51.764 --> 39:56.602
you totally feel the taste of tomato,

39:56.685 --> 39:59.522
mozzarella, basil and of olive oil.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.359
This is the Mistaken Margherita!

40:04.151 --> 40:06.737
It tastes like
a traditional Neapolitan pie.

40:07.863 --> 40:08.989
With everything amped up a little bit.

40:11.700 --> 40:14.078
There's our address.
234. Very simple, very easy.

40:15.830 --> 40:17.832
This is surreal.

40:17.915 --> 40:19.458
So, is there a greeting?
Can we say anything?

40:19.542 --> 40:22.336
First, let's run to the door.
Let the customer know we're...

40:22.420 --> 40:24.547
You gotta hustle.
-You gotta hustle. You run to the door

40:24.630 --> 40:27.049
'cause you never know
if they're standing there looking at you.

40:27.133 --> 40:28.175
Hello.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.176
-Hello.
-Hello.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.469
You ordered two medium pies.

40:30.553 --> 40:32.179
-Yes.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.806
Let me get you your change.

40:33.889 --> 40:34.807
It's all right.

40:34.890 --> 40:35.766
-Sure.

40:35.850 --> 40:37.726
Oh, thank you very much.
You have a wonderful day.

40:37.810 --> 40:38.811
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

40:38.894 --> 40:40.396
-Take care.
-Bye, guys.

40:43.315 --> 40:44.900
And, basically, that's it.

40:44.984 --> 40:46.402
That was weird.

40:51.907 --> 40:53.242
I got this one.

40:54.243 --> 40:56.620
-Wait for the car. Go, run across.

41:02.585 --> 41:03.961
I give him the receipt?

41:04.044 --> 41:08.132
Uh, no. Receipt's just for us.
Everything's attached to the box for them.

41:09.967 --> 41:11.343
Hi, Ricardo.

41:11.427 --> 41:12.678
This is your

41:12.761 --> 41:14.430
You gotta take it out of the bag.
We don't wanna give him that.

41:14.513 --> 41:16.682
Sorry, my first day on the job.

41:19.143 --> 41:22.146
Those who are eating pizza here

41:22.229 --> 41:26.650
can watch my team working downstairs,
making pizza.

41:26.734 --> 41:28.903
You stream this on the Internet?

41:28.986 --> 41:30.446
It's the new open kitchen.

41:30.529 --> 41:33.032
I created a corner,
three tables.

41:33.115 --> 41:37.244
A sommelier matches pizzas
with wine and champagne.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.288
This is the champagne room
we're going into now.

41:41.248 --> 41:42.917
Wow. Look at that.

41:44.585 --> 41:47.254
You ever thought about, like, buying
the apartment upstairs above Lucali,

41:47.338 --> 41:49.173
and doing a little bit of this action?

41:49.256 --> 41:52.134
-Put a pole where I could slide down.

41:52.218 --> 41:53.552
Wow!

41:53.636 --> 41:54.762
Wait till you see this.

41:54.845 --> 41:56.514
These are reserved tables.

41:56.597 --> 42:02.436
I have created this corner
for people who want to eat pizza.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.522
On their own, in silence.

42:04.605 --> 42:06.440
I could get...
I would charge $1,000 for it.

42:06.524 --> 42:07.983
-Just to sit there.
-Yeah.

42:08.567 --> 42:09.944
Pizza extra.

42:10.027 --> 42:11.278
This is pizza heaven.

42:11.362 --> 42:12.988
Yeah, I don't know
that you can do better.

42:13.072 --> 42:14.073
No.

42:15.407 --> 42:17.660
-We need to take video for Dave.

42:17.743 --> 42:20.412
Right, yeah. Yeah, if Dave was here,
he'd be ordering Domino's.

42:20.496 --> 42:22.456
He would be on his app,
trying to figure out

42:22.540 --> 42:25.918
if he could get 'em to send one up here,
his favorite pizza.

42:30.548 --> 42:33.259
Has anyone offered you
anything other than money

42:33.342 --> 42:36.428
We do have a regular customer
in our Patterson store.

42:36.512 --> 42:39.473
She always comes to the door
wearing a negligee.

42:39.557 --> 42:42.142
Very see-through,
and nothing at all underneath it.

42:42.226 --> 42:45.187
-No, I think that is the tip.

42:47.523 --> 42:49.733
Who doesn't wanna be a pizza man?

42:49.817 --> 42:54.863
It does come from
my grandmother's kitchen and her palate.

42:54.947 --> 42:57.116
When you're in my restaurant...

42:57.199 --> 43:00.077
it's like, you're not coming there
to eat pizza,

43:00.160 --> 43:01.912
you're going there to visit Mark.

43:01.996 --> 43:06.166
Kind of, like, every Sunday,
going to her house to have dinner.

43:07.167 --> 43:10.963
So what do you make of,
like, the Neapolitan pizza consortium?

43:11.046 --> 43:14.300
The people who give out the stamp
that say it's...

43:14.383 --> 43:16.176
DOC or DOP.

43:16.260 --> 43:19.054
Is that a shakedown
or is there some merit to it?

43:23.017 --> 43:26.729
For me,
only good pizza exists.

43:32.067 --> 43:33.944
Again, we wanna jog up
and make sure

43:34.028 --> 43:35.863
that if they're looking at us,
or anyone else is looking,

43:35.946 --> 43:37.239
we're representing who we are.

43:38.616 --> 43:40.993
So I tell the new pizza makers,

43:41.076 --> 43:44.830
look inside yourself
to create an identity for your pizza,

43:44.913 --> 43:48.125
and try to offer it to people
in the best possible way.

43:48.667 --> 43:51.337
Okay, I have no idea
how to get in this door.

43:51.920 --> 43:53.547
Have you ever just eaten the pizza?

43:53.631 --> 43:55.841
-No, never done that.

43:57.718 --> 43:59.678
<i>-Salute!</i>
<i>-Salute!</i>

44:04.058 --> 44:05.309
I'm at the door downstairs.

44:05.392 --> 44:07.645
Looks like the machine,
I don't know if it's not working or not.

44:07.728 --> 44:10.606
Is there any way you can buzz me in?
Thank you, bye.

44:10.689 --> 44:11.690
Do you think Domino's...

44:14.943 --> 44:16.445
Not to put you on the spot, but I am.

44:16.528 --> 44:18.656
It's very good. It is very good pizza.

44:18.739 --> 44:22.534
When done correctly, our pizza is,
it's up there with anybody.

44:22.618 --> 44:24.328
And I've been to...

44:24.411 --> 44:28.123
I actually went to Italy to look
for the right pizza, the perfect pizza.

44:28.207 --> 44:30.584
And I gotta tell you that,
went to four cities,

44:30.668 --> 44:32.586
and in those four cities,
I could have made a better pizza

44:32.670 --> 44:34.630
than every one of them made.

44:34.713 --> 44:37.299
If people that like Domino's,
and only like Domino's,

44:37.383 --> 44:38.676
but they haven't had any other pizza...

44:38.759 --> 44:40.427
Right, it's a different product.

44:41.929 --> 44:43.555
-Correct.
-It's...

44:43.639 --> 44:46.016
I now have a wealth of pizza knowledge.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.977
I'm not saying Domino's is not delicious,
but I'm...

44:49.061 --> 44:50.854
-I love Domino's.
-Yes.

44:50.938 --> 44:52.564
But I'm not saying
it's the greatest pizza in the world.

44:52.648 --> 44:53.482
Okay.

44:54.066 --> 44:55.109
Is that the guy?

44:58.278 --> 45:04.660
A Netflix documentary
on delivery and pizzas. Pizza delivery.

45:04.743 --> 45:06.703
All right. Thank you very much.

45:06.787 --> 45:09.915
That's it
I'm not doing another delivery.

45:19.258 --> 45:22.302
<i> I view authenticity</i>
<i>like a totalitarian state.</i>

45:23.345 --> 45:26.557
<i>It's something that, I think,</i>
<i>has been overvalued.</i>

45:27.141 --> 45:29.935
But reality is,
it hasn't been scrutinized enough.

45:31.437 --> 45:34.940
If you really boil it down to
why food in Italy is gonna be so good,

45:35.524 --> 45:38.318
<i>it's because you're there,</i>
<i>the terroir makes a big difference.</i>

45:38.402 --> 45:39.903
<i>There's microorganisms.</i>

45:40.487 --> 45:44.575
<i>There's the people there,</i>
<i>there's the smells. It's what makes it.</i>

45:45.826 --> 45:47.828
<i>It's not that I hate authenticity.</i>

45:47.911 --> 45:52.040
I hate that people want
this singular thing that is authentic.

45:54.084 --> 45:55.711
<i>There are people</i>
<i>that are making Italian food</i>

45:55.794 --> 45:59.256
<i>that are more Italian</i>
<i>in its idea and thesis</i>

45:59.339 --> 46:01.675
than anyone in Italy is making,

46:01.758 --> 46:04.761
because they're not using
anything that's imported.

46:04.845 --> 46:07.431
<i>They're using</i>
<i>everything that's around them.</i>

46:09.391 --> 46:10.476
Last year in Japan,

46:10.559 --> 46:14.813
I told our Japanese members that
I was pleased for the extremely high level

46:14.897 --> 46:16.023
of their product.

46:16.106 --> 46:18.066
Then I said, "No, please stop improving.

46:18.150 --> 46:22.196
Because, if you make pizza better
than we do, I'd get really angry."

46:23.655 --> 46:25.824
You think that we can
do anything better in America

46:25.908 --> 46:28.160
than the Japanese do here?

46:28.243 --> 46:34.124
Japanese are so dedicated
in a way that Americans are just not.

46:35.709 --> 46:37.211
This is true.

46:43.509 --> 46:45.552
<i>Konnichiwa!</i>

46:48.096 --> 46:50.807
<i>I love this restaurant because</i>

46:50.891 --> 46:55.479
it embodies everything I love about
what I think authenticity should be.

46:56.063 --> 47:00.734
I went to Naples
23 years ago.

47:00.817 --> 47:05.739
It was just for fun, but not to study.

47:05.822 --> 47:08.116
Basically, I just went there to eat.

47:09.284 --> 47:10.118
Learn through eating.

47:17.668 --> 47:19.086
Very funny. Very funny.

47:20.295 --> 47:22.923
When I first started at a pizzeria,

47:23.006 --> 47:26.843
everything was imported from Italy,
but it wasn't of good quality.

47:27.427 --> 47:32.349
Everyone thinks that delicious pizza
is made from Italian flour,

47:32.432 --> 47:35.644
<i>but I think that's wrong.</i>

47:36.144 --> 47:38.522
Fresh flour is best.

47:38.605 --> 47:42.109
So if you're in Japan,
it's Japanese flour.

47:45.112 --> 47:49.408
<i>Everything was imitation at first.</i>
<i>Everything.</i>

47:50.117 --> 47:56.498
<i>The music, the food,</i>
<i>everything started as a copy.</i>

47:56.582 --> 48:01.253
But I think Japanese people
are good at taking something

48:01.336 --> 48:05.090
and making it their own,
making it original.

48:05.716 --> 48:08.385
<i>That's true</i>
<i>in a lot of art forms.</i>

48:08.468 --> 48:11.013
If you watch the progression
of people that are great,

48:11.096 --> 48:14.224
they often start
just imitating things they like.

48:15.142 --> 48:18.604
<i>And then, over time,</i>
<i>they develop their own style,</i>

48:18.687 --> 48:21.064
<i>and then they evolve beyond it.</i>

48:23.775 --> 48:27.362
<i>When I tell people I think</i>
<i>the best pizza in the world's in Tokyo,</i>

48:27.446 --> 48:29.406
I see. Yeah--

48:29.489 --> 48:31.283
But people get upset.

48:31.366 --> 48:33.493
They don't get upset when I say
the best sushi, the best ramen,

48:33.577 --> 48:36.246
-the best French restaurant--
-I think, on first hearing it,

48:36.330 --> 48:38.874
their gut reaction is just one of shock.

48:38.957 --> 48:42.794
Or are they not believing it because

48:42.878 --> 48:46.131
people believe it's gotta be
this Italian, Italian

48:46.214 --> 48:50.677
What Naples has given me is pizza,

48:50.761 --> 48:54.514
which I make in the image of myself.

49:00.604 --> 49:02.314
<i>This is, to me, the best way </i>

49:02.397 --> 49:05.859
<i>to show homage</i>
<i>to something you love the most.</i>

49:05.942 --> 49:08.403
By not replicating it
with the exact ingredients.

50:11.675 --> 50:14.720
<i>What did I know about pizza? </i>
<i>But I care.</i>

50:14.803 --> 50:18.682
Whether I was Italian, Asian,

50:18.765 --> 50:23.520
as long as I care about what I'm doing,
and wanna put the best product out there.

50:23.603 --> 50:25.439
Is it so cheesy to say that

50:25.522 --> 50:27.691
as long as you care,
or if you put love into the food,

50:27.774 --> 50:29.401
No.

50:29.484 --> 50:31.862
No, no, no. No.
You still need to know what...

50:32.946 --> 50:34.364
you know, good pizza tastes like.

50:35.449 --> 50:37.909
I liked the way you tried
to tightly wrap that up, though.

50:37.993 --> 50:39.536
That was good.

50:39.619 --> 50:41.538
-Yeah.

50:41.621 --> 50:44.082
Little warm swell of violins at the end.

50:45.792 --> 50:47.794
If you ever send Domino's
to my pizzeria again,

50:47.878 --> 50:49.212
we're gonna be rolling around
on the sidewalk.

50:51.548 --> 50:52.632
Wow.

50:55.302 --> 50:56.970
Whoa!

50:58.221 --> 50:59.556
What?

50:59.639 --> 51:00.891
-Oh, my God.
-This is amazing.

51:00.974 --> 51:02.225
What!

51:02.309 --> 51:03.477
Okay.

51:24.956 --> 51:26.500
-That was cool.
I thought you were gonna sing.

51:26.583 --> 51:27.584
No, no, no, no.

51:27.667 --> 51:28.794
Chang's gonna sing next time.
