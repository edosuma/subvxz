Our brother in Christ,
Father Daniel

03:13.920 --> 03:17.288
leaves us today for
the seminary in Douai

03:17.320 --> 03:19.561
to perfect his understanding
of the Holy Church.

03:23.320 --> 03:26.767
Show this pass to any whose
assistance you require.

03:27.520 --> 03:28.601
I put my name to it.

03:28.640 --> 03:31.644
If they're loyal to
the one true church

03:31.680 --> 03:33.603
they will succour
and protect you.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.962
Before Father Daniel departs

03:37.000 --> 03:39.241
let us renew the fourth vow
of our order.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.290
I, Henry Garnet...

03:42.360 --> 03:43.964
I, John Gerard...

03:44.000 --> 03:46.048
I, Daniel Smith...

03:53.720 --> 03:57.122
...promise a special obedience
to our sovereign pontiff in Rome

03:57.160 --> 04:00.767
our Holy Father,
to faithfully further and protect...

04:00.800 --> 04:04.282
PRIESTS RECITE: ...the interest of
the one true apostolic church.

04:04.320 --> 04:05.810
DOOR OPENS LOUDLY

04:05.840 --> 04:09.208
Milady! There are men outside
on foot and horse.

04:09.240 --> 04:10.605
They surround the house!

04:12.000 --> 04:13.411
By God, they shall not enter.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.442
No, Robin,
keep your sword still.

04:15.480 --> 04:16.925
We are well-prepared.

04:18.440 --> 04:19.771
Come.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.928
Go upstairs, turn the beds
and put the cold side up.

04:21.959 --> 04:24.008
Quickly!
- MAID: Yes, milady.

04:31.120 --> 04:32.690
POUNDING ON DOOR

04:34.840 --> 04:36.171
Forgive me, Father.

04:40.720 --> 04:41.767
By order of the King

04:41.800 --> 04:43.882
I command you within
to open this door!

POUNDING ON DOOR

04:54.560 --> 04:55.846

Hurry, Father.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.365
Just be still.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.369
POUNDING ON DOOR

05:24.400 --> 05:25.367
Who demands entry?

05:25.400 --> 05:27.084
I'm Sir William Wade.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.767
What is your business here, William?
- It's the King's business!

05:31.800 --> 05:33.484
Now open this door before
I order it blustered!

05:49.280 --> 05:50.930
Robin, I beg you.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.849
Do not give them cause
to do us violence.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.042
POUNDING ON DOOR

06:04.320 --> 06:05.890
POUNDING ON DOOR

06:25.600 --> 06:27.409
I know you, Catesby.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.928
And I know your skill with a sword.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.768
Have a care what you do
in my house.

06:47.280 --> 06:51.410
It is curious, madam, that your cousin
did prevent my entry

06:51.440 --> 06:54.569
for such an unconscionable
length of time.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.204
Sir...

06:56.240 --> 06:58.720
What man would admit a troop
of desperate men

06:58.760 --> 07:01.650
armed with swords and pikes
to a widow's house

07:01.680 --> 07:04.604
scarcely before she and her niece
have risen from their beds?

07:04.640 --> 07:08.247
Your intrusion is impolite
and unlawful.

07:10.880 --> 07:14.009
I shall have the names of all those
within these walls.

07:15.680 --> 07:18.001
Question the servants closely
so their names

07:18.040 --> 07:20.008
parish of their birth and
the length of their service

07:20.040 --> 07:21.963
with the Lady Dorothy.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.126
Madam...

07:23.920 --> 07:27.527
I counsel you most earnestly.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.250
Deliver up the priest.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.561
Priest?

07:36.360 --> 07:40.968
I know there is a Jesuit priest
in this house.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.089
THEY BREATH RAPIDLY

07:48.280 --> 07:51.250
Search for this phantom priest
if you must

07:51.280 --> 07:54.329
but if you truly seek one
who has not the right to be here

07:54.360 --> 07:56.169
go, sir, to a mirror.

07:59.320 --> 08:00.685
Hm.

08:03.760 --> 08:06.604
Search closely.
Search every room, every closet.

08:06.640 --> 08:10.201
For every bed slept in,
find the man or woman that laid there.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.326
Your eager hounds will
find nothing here

08:21.360 --> 08:23.283
to gorge their appetites.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.521
MEN CLATTER THROUGH THE HOUSE

08:28.960 --> 08:30.041
Get up.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.647
INDISTINCT YELLS

08:48.200 --> 08:50.362
CLATTERING CONTINUES

08:58.880 --> 09:00.405
We have made a thorough
search of the house.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.329
There's nothing out of
the ordinary.

09:06.840 --> 09:09.002
Your sport here is finished, Wade.

09:10.160 --> 09:11.161
Be gone.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.770
THEY BREATHE RAPIDLY

10:12.840 --> 10:14.808
SHE INHALES TENSELY

10:30.800 --> 10:32.609
Are you playing us
a child's game, sir?

10:33.760 --> 10:36.764
Your searches have told you plain
there is nothing here.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.368
Your breath is foul, sir.

10:42.080 --> 10:46.722
The air in this house, madam,
is rancid

10:47.560 --> 10:49.050
with pOperY-

11:00.320 --> 11:02.527
Mistress Anne Vaux.

11:04.960 --> 11:09.682
About you I have heard
a great deal.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.845
Tell me...

11:14.360 --> 11:18.160
Is it true you lie with
the priests you shelter?

11:19.320 --> 11:22.483
This is indeed child's play
and impertinence.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.726
It is a sign that you have nothing
of importance

11:25.760 --> 11:27.569
with which to charge us.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.844
Measure carefully without

11:32.800 --> 11:34.290
and within.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.243
THEY BREATHE RAPIDLY

12:33.600 --> 12:35.090
Sir...

12:44.040 --> 12:46.486
The measurements without
do not tally with those of the hall.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.329
Do you mean to pull down
my house, sir?

13:30.360 --> 13:34.445
Sir, every corner of my home has
already been searched and disordered.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.050
Madam...

13:37.600 --> 13:39.011
Be quiet.

13:48.600 --> 13:52.241

14:17.240 --> 14:18.401
Get out!

14:18.440 --> 14:19.771
WADE:
Hold him to his knees.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.891
DANIEL SHIVERS

14:47.160 --> 14:48.400
What is your name?

14:50.640 --> 14:52.449
Smith.
- Smith.

15:02.560 --> 15:07.441
Why do you have such a paper
in your possession?

15:12.240 --> 15:13.810
Who gave you this paper?

15:14.640 --> 15:16.005
Where's your man?!
- DANIEL WHIMPERS

15:16.040 --> 15:18.930
I have no memory
who gave it to me, sir!

15:25.440 --> 15:28.284
It is signed Henry Garnet.

15:29.800 --> 15:33.168
WADE:
Garnet gave you this, hm?

15:33.920 --> 15:36.321
It's to secure your passage
to Flanders, was it not?

15:41.240 --> 15:44.687
This paper will see you dead, boy.

15:46.760 --> 15:48.888
Take him away.
- No!

15:50.720 --> 15:51.881
DANIEL:
Please!

15:51.920 --> 15:53.604
DANIEL GROANS

15:57.160 --> 15:58.207
Hm.

15:58.960 --> 16:02.123
I am responsible for this house
and all within it.

16:02.840 --> 16:05.684
I alone.
They knew nothing.

16:08.080 --> 16:10.447
Well, take her as well.
- What?

16:12.120 --> 16:14.327
It has never been the practise
to take the women.

16:14.960 --> 16:18.646
Well, the practise no longer fits
the times in which we live.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.961
No, sir, you shall not take her.

16:22.920 --> 16:26.242
Madam, I shall I take
who I please.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.128
By God, you shall not.

16:38.520 --> 16:39.760
DOROTHY:
I shall go with them.

16:40.360 --> 16:41.964
I'm not afraid.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.281
SWORD IS SHEATHED

17:27.400 --> 17:29.767
ANNE CRIES

17:36.880 --> 17:39.486
There was nothing
to incriminate Catesby?

17:41.040 --> 17:44.362
The woman exonerated him
and his cousin from complicity

17:44.400 --> 17:46.209
in the hiding of the priest.

17:47.280 --> 17:50.523
Garnet was sending the boy
to Flanders.

17:50.560 --> 17:53.484
Undoubtedly with intelligence
for Stanley.

17:54.680 --> 17:56.808
Stanley plots the invasion
from without

17:56.840 --> 17:58.683
Garnet the rebellion
from within.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.811
It is imminent.

18:01.120 --> 18:04.522
Flanders is where these dangerous
spirits are gathered

18:04.560 --> 18:06.562
and Stanley is their leader.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.886
Did you put the boy-priest
to torture?

18:11.080 --> 18:14.801
To the, er, gentler tortures

18:14.840 --> 18:16.968
at first, My Lord,
then he was racked.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.446
I had hoped you would bring me
a full confession.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.689
It would help to convince
His Majesty

18:21.720 --> 18:24.485
of the true danger
the Catholics pose.

18:25.320 --> 18:28.927
Can His Majesty not see
the danger the Kingdom is in?

18:28.960 --> 18:31.247
His Majesty wants to be Solomon.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.408
A blessed peacemaker.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.890
He fears that harsher persecution
will jeopardise

18:36.920 --> 18:39.002
the peace treaty he seeks with Spain

18:39.040 --> 18:42.010
a treaty he is most anxious
to secure.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.561
Scflbe.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.890
There's no time for conversation.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.649
It seems there is ample time
to torture and maim

19:51.680 --> 19:54.331
but yet not one minute to speak
words of love and pity.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.691
What world is this?

19:57.720 --> 20:00.166
I beg you, save yourself.

Dearest Anne, shed no tears

21:00.920 --> 21:02.763
And you shall not

21:04.360 --> 21:06.761
I will not say amen to your prayers.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.449
Nor shall you to mine.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.483
Dorothy Dibdale, you have
refused to enter a plea

21:13.520 --> 21:15.090

21:15.120 --> 21:17.487

a Jesuit priest at your house

21:23.600 --> 21:25.090

Will you answer the charge?

21:25.960 --> 21:27.485
I will not.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.247
My niece and heir will be
free of the stain

21:31.280 --> 21:33.442
with which you would smear her

21:33.480 --> 21:38.122
and you will not, by my plea,
dispossess her of her inheritance.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.604
I pray for the King

28:14.240 --> 28:15.651
Oh! Ho-ho!
- APPLAUSE

28:16.520 --> 28:19.444
Oh, well done, Philip!
HE LAUGHS

28:22.160 --> 28:24.083
Oh!
- COURTIERS APPLAUSE

28:26.120 --> 28:29.249
By God, I love thee dearly, Philip!

28:31.440 --> 28:33.283
THEY LAUGH

28:36.520 --> 28:39.444
Did my cankered beagle enjoy
the performance?

28:39.480 --> 28:41.847
Very much so.
You have astonishing skills, sir.

28:41.880 --> 28:44.724
Perhaps you would care to
perform some tricks of your own

28:44.760 --> 28:46.410
for our amusement?

28:47.600 --> 28:49.602
Sadly, I am not shaped for tricks.

28:49.640 --> 28:50.971
There would be no
amusement in it.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.924
On the contrary, there would be
great amusement to be had

28:53.960 --> 28:55.450
from watching you perform.

28:57.560 --> 29:00.848
Have you had an opportunity
to read the papers I sent you, sir?

29:05.080 --> 29:06.206
Not all of them.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.891
There are nests of conspirators
abroad in the country

29:08.920 --> 29:13.130
who seek Spain's aid and that
of the Pope to plot an invasion.

29:13.160 --> 29:15.527
The dangers to Your Majesty

29:15.560 --> 29:18.689
and his family
are of the gravest nature.

29:18.720 --> 29:21.769
We have heard this siren song
from you before, Lord Cecil.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.450
You must bring down a heavy hand.

29:23.480 --> 29:24.811
'Must'?

29:26.520 --> 29:28.568
Must is not a word you use
to princes.

29:29.080 --> 29:30.730
You forget yourself.

29:34.080 --> 29:37.721
Every papist in the Kingdom
is a potential traitor.

29:37.760 --> 29:39.649
They must be watched, harried

29:39.680 --> 29:41.330
and made to answer
for their crimes.

29:41.360 --> 29:43.886
There are already good
and sufficient laws

29:43.920 --> 29:45.649
for the suppression of
the Catholics.

29:45.680 --> 29:48.047
CECIL:
We need new laws rigorously applied.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.606
What you propose, sir,
is a recipe for rebellion.

29:50.640 --> 29:52.529
On the contrary,
My Lord Northumberland

29:52.560 --> 29:55.564
it is a necessary recipe
to avoid rebellion.

29:55.600 --> 29:58.843
New laws will cause greater offense
to the Spanish.

29:58.880 --> 30:03.249
Further provocation would serve
us poorly in the negotiations to come.

30:05.360 --> 30:06.771
Your papers prove nothing.

30:06.800 --> 30:12.523
Catholics, in my experience,
are loyal and quiet if left in peace.

30:12.560 --> 30:15.086
Continue to hang their priests
as you find them, Master Secretary

30:15.120 --> 30:19.603
but keep the disturbance on
my Catholic subjects to a minimum.

30:21.760 --> 30:23.046
Must have peace with Spain.

30:26.440 --> 30:27.680
Again.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.610
PHILIP:
One, two, three...

30:30.640 --> 30:33.086
We shall need harder evidence.
- JAMES LAUGHS

30:34.160 --> 30:36.288
Get you to the Tower,
Sir William.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.848
There is a prisoner I wish to meet.

30:40.960 --> 30:43.691
JAMES AND COURTIERS LAUGH

31:35.120 --> 31:36.645
HE STRUGGLES

32:14.760 --> 32:16.569
BARNET:
For I am the resurrection.

32:16.920 --> 32:18.604
He who believeth in me

32:19.760 --> 32:21.728
though he be dead,
shall live.

32:23.600 --> 32:26.444
BARN ET SPEAKS LATIN

32:28.160 --> 32:29.810
Amen.
- Amen.

32:33.720 --> 32:35.927
My sister was crushed like a seed.

32:37.520 --> 32:40.330
Our brother,
butchered like a hog.

32:43.280 --> 32:45.203
They will be revenged.

32:45.240 --> 32:47.971
You have always been quick to
draw your sword, Robin.

32:48.840 --> 32:52.128
And now is the not the time
to kindle spirits into flame.

32:52.960 --> 32:55.691
Tonight we lay these two martyrs
in their grave.

32:59.160 --> 33:01.640
Tomorrow night it could be me
or it could be you.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.684
If we do not raise the sword in our defence,
what then do we do?

33:05.840 --> 33:08.446
How are we to survive?
- The sword plays no part in what we do.

33:08.480 --> 33:09.720
It must...

33:10.880 --> 33:12.450
if we are to save ourselves.

33:12.480 --> 33:14.323
Thou shall commit no murder.

33:53.120 --> 33:55.691
INDISTINCT YELLS

34:13.920 --> 34:18.402
Captain Turner, you have been
a soldier these 14 years past?

34:18.440 --> 34:20.601
I have, My Lord,
and always served...

34:20.639 --> 34:23.041
Why are you here?
- My Lord?

34:23.080 --> 34:26.562
Why stand you a prisoner in chains?

34:26.600 --> 34:29.570
I was indicted for the killing
of a man, My Lord

34:29.600 --> 34:31.887
by some that sought to profit
from my death.

34:32.520 --> 34:35.170
That is, My Lord, I quarrelled
with a man.

34:35.199 --> 34:36.929
Hard words were offered.

34:36.960 --> 34:39.565
He had slandered my good name
in respect of a woman

34:39.600 --> 34:42.080
and I had no other recourse
but to seek satisfaction.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.487
You stabbed an innkeeper
through the eye

34:44.520 --> 34:46.409
after you had laid hands
upon his wife.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.161
You were observed by a
score of witnesses

34:49.199 --> 34:50.645
stood trial at the assizes

34:50.679 --> 34:52.762
and now are condemned to death.

34:52.800 --> 34:56.885
Such is my unhappy
and undeserved fate, My Lord.

34:57.560 --> 35:01.610
Your family are of Catholic stock?
- No! My Lord, on my life!

35:01.640 --> 35:06.248
Jacob Turner of Battle
in the County of Sussex.

35:06.280 --> 35:08.203
Your father, I believe.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.401
At the Sessions of Michaelmas

35:09.440 --> 35:12.284
was accused of recusancy,
fined 27 shillings.

35:12.320 --> 35:15.290
Robert Turner of Battle, Sussex,
your brother...

35:15.320 --> 35:18.051
My Lord, I detest popery
with all my heart.

35:18.720 --> 35:21.724
My family are unknown to me
these 12 years past.

35:21.760 --> 35:22.807
Upon my honour...

35:22.840 --> 35:26.208
Your honour, Captain Turner,
such as it is

35:27.200 --> 35:28.804
holds no interest for me.

35:29.200 --> 35:32.010
You're here because you may yet
perform some service

35:32.040 --> 35:35.249
to the King, your country
and me.

35:39.280 --> 35:40.691
Upon my life

35:41.080 --> 35:43.447
I will perform whatever
you ask of me.

35:43.480 --> 35:47.166
Your life now belongs to me,
Captain Turner.

35:53.160 --> 35:55.162
This is your cipher.

35:55.200 --> 35:57.601
Each symbol represents a letter.

35:58.440 --> 36:00.886
Your correspondence will be
with His Lordship.

36:01.920 --> 36:05.288
His Lordship is number one,
you are number 32.

36:05.320 --> 36:08.449
Never refer to yourself
or His Lordship by name.

36:08.480 --> 36:09.766
Do you understand?

36:11.720 --> 36:12.926
Alum ink.

36:12.960 --> 36:16.567
Invisible to the eye unless it be
exposed to heat.

36:17.480 --> 36:20.802
In Flanders you will seek out
a notorious papist

36:20.840 --> 36:22.171
Sir William Stanley.

36:22.200 --> 36:23.122
Do you know him?

36:23.160 --> 36:24.730
He is a soldier of great repute.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.888
Stanley is a turncoat and traitor.

36:26.920 --> 36:29.605
And the leader of a nest
of dangerous Catholics

36:29.640 --> 36:31.688
who plot the King's destruction.

36:31.720 --> 36:34.405
You will discover his designs
and stratagems

36:34.440 --> 36:36.681
and report them back to me.

36:36.720 --> 36:40.008
This will ease your entry
into his society.

36:41.120 --> 36:44.408
Now, go. A ship for your
passage awaits you.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.451
DOOR OPENS

36:59.440 --> 37:01.681
They demand payment
by tomorrow.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.803
If we sell these,
it should raise what we need.

37:06.280 --> 37:07.361
Does it hurt?

37:07.400 --> 37:09.641
No, Uncle Tom, 'tis nothing
but a broken head.

37:09.680 --> 37:10.727
Ha.

37:11.440 --> 37:12.646
Nothing but a broken head.

37:14.280 --> 37:17.204
It takes a strong will to
stand your ground.

37:17.240 --> 37:18.924
You grandson's a brave lad.

37:19.560 --> 37:22.848
What were you thinking
letting him fight with those bullies?

37:22.880 --> 37:25.042
A man must learn to take
his bruises.

37:26.360 --> 37:28.442
You're selling those, too, Father?

37:28.480 --> 37:30.084
The house empties by the day.

37:30.120 --> 37:31.360
Would you rather that I conform?

37:45.800 --> 37:47.768
The more I resist them,
the more they take.

37:51.160 --> 37:53.162
Look at your father
when he speaks to you, Robert.

37:57.760 --> 37:58.886
May I go?

38:08.200 --> 38:09.645
ROBERT:
You saw that, Mother.

38:14.360 --> 38:15.771
He fears me.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.923
Sons should fear their fathers.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.167
The better they may learn
to fear God.

38:29.160 --> 38:32.323
Anne Hudson of Kenilworth,
widow

38:32.360 --> 38:35.364
on 17 September 1603
at Stoneleigh

38:35.400 --> 38:37.402
is alleged to have spoken
the following...

38:37.440 --> 38:39.044
'The Spaniards will come

38:39.080 --> 38:40.923
and I would they were
come soon.

38:40.960 --> 38:43.930
A plague of God light upon
all the King's subjects.'

38:45.760 --> 38:46.727
How do you plead?

38:48.120 --> 38:50.327
I put myself on God
and my country.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.208
Bring forth the witness.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.451
You were present
at the alehouse

38:58.480 --> 39:01.290
when the accused spoke
the said seditious words?

39:01.320 --> 39:02.560
I was, sir.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.682
And what did you
hear her say?

39:04.720 --> 39:07.371
I heard her say the words in
the indictment, sir.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.084
AUDIENCE MURMURS

39:09.120 --> 39:11.248
INDISTINCT WHISPERS

39:12.080 --> 39:14.003
We find the charge is proved.

39:14.040 --> 39:15.963
Additionally, James Hudson,
her son

39:16.000 --> 39:18.606
aged eight years or
thereabouts, labourer

39:18.640 --> 39:21.689
stole bread from Robert Edmunds
to the value of 1O pennies.

39:22.520 --> 39:23.646
Yes.

39:24.080 --> 39:27.527
50 strokes by the beating
for the mother, 2O for the son.

39:27.560 --> 39:29.642
SHE CRIES

39:31.000 --> 39:32.286
JUDGE:
Who comes next?

39:32.880 --> 39:34.006
LAWYER:
The popish recusants, sir.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.768
Robert Catesby,
come to the bar.

39:37.520 --> 39:39.522
Thomas Wintour,
come to the bar.

39:39.560 --> 39:44.407
John Rawlins, Edward Tidmarsh,
and Worthing's Robert Bolton.

39:46.880 --> 39:49.281
You are come again before us,
Catesby.

39:50.040 --> 39:52.407
Are you so addicted to
these sessions?

39:52.440 --> 39:53.362
AUDIENCE LAUGHS

39:53.400 --> 39:55.209
I am addicted to the truth, sir.

39:56.200 --> 39:59.363
You may grand claim, sir, for one
whose priests pander

39:59.400 --> 40:02.449
superstition and magic
to their ignorant, deluded flock...

40:02.480 --> 40:04.642
We both know the reasons
why I'm come here, sir.

40:04.680 --> 40:06.045
I suggest we proceed.

40:08.240 --> 40:12.450
You stand indicted for being absent
from your parish churches for 4O Sundays.

40:12.480 --> 40:14.403
AUDIENCE REACTS

40:14.440 --> 40:17.649
This court fines each of you
the sum of £5.

40:17.680 --> 40:18.886
AUDIENCE REACTS

40:18.920 --> 40:21.207
And in respect of you,
Robert Catesby

40:21.240 --> 40:22.969
and you, Thomas Wintour

40:23.000 --> 40:26.288
there are outstanding sums
as yet unpaid.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.480
£8 and £3 respectively.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.643
With respect, sir

40:33.360 --> 40:35.408
it has always been practise
that a...

40:35.440 --> 40:37.283
We have commission from
His Majesty

40:37.320 --> 40:39.846
to sit in judgment at these
general sessions

40:39.880 --> 40:43.089
and to levy such fines
as we deem fit.

40:43.120 --> 40:45.805
These fines are beyond
all reasonableness.

40:47.040 --> 40:50.203
Our authority comes from
the King himself.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.368
The King is but a man.
- AUDIENCE REACTS

40:52.400 --> 40:54.562
Robert...
- The King wields no power

40:54.600 --> 40:56.443
over the mortal soul
of his subjects.

40:56.480 --> 40:58.084
God alone has that power!

40:58.120 --> 40:59.531
You will mind your speech, sir.

40:59.560 --> 41:02.404
Is it the King's privilege to sit
in judgement on men's souls?

41:02.440 --> 41:05.046
Silence!
- I say I owe my soul's allegiance

41:05.080 --> 41:06.206
to God alone!

41:06.240 --> 41:07.162
JUDGE:
Silence!

41:07.200 --> 41:10.568
I will not bow my head to any man
whose flesh and blood

41:10.600 --> 41:12.762
carries no more divinity
than mine own!

41:12.800 --> 41:13.801
Silence!

41:13.840 --> 41:17.128
It is the order of this general session
that you both be held in jail

41:17.160 --> 41:18.650
until payment is made!

41:18.680 --> 41:20.170
Take them away!

41:20.200 --> 41:22.362
AUDIENCE CLAMOURS

41:35.920 --> 41:37.160
Sir Joseph.

41:37.200 --> 41:38.645
Mistress Vaux.

41:38.680 --> 41:42.651
£13 for my cousin Catesby
and £8 for Thomas Wintour.

41:42.680 --> 41:45.126
The prisoners may now be released.
- HE SCOFFS

41:45.160 --> 41:47.640
Not yet, Mistress Vaux.
- Not yet, sir?

41:48.040 --> 41:52.250
The prisoners caused such outrageous
stir during their appearance

41:52.280 --> 41:55.489
that they may now face
additional charges of contempt.

41:55.520 --> 41:58.444
You say they may be charged?
They have not been charged?

41:58.480 --> 42:00.130
Not as yet.
- Then, Sir Joseph

42:00.160 --> 42:02.561
you must by law
release them.

42:02.600 --> 42:05.809
No man may be kept under
restraint without charge.

42:05.840 --> 42:07.046
Mistress Vaux...

42:07.080 --> 42:09.811
As you will discover when I
bring suit against you

42:09.840 --> 42:11.365
for the unlawful detention...
- Oh?

42:11.400 --> 42:13.243
...of two of His Majesty's subjects.

42:14.400 --> 42:16.243
There is law yet in this land

42:16.280 --> 42:18.851
and I will see that you answer
for what you do.

42:32.720 --> 42:33.767
THOMAS
A jail.

42:34.760 --> 42:36.444
It's even bleaker than I remember.

42:37.360 --> 42:39.806
Next time we should demand a cell
with a better aspect.

42:39.840 --> 42:41.444
I cannot go on as I am, Tom.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.249
My lands are mortgaged,
my name disgraced.

42:44.280 --> 42:46.169
I am spat upon and reviled.

42:47.600 --> 42:49.250
Well, toughen your hide.

42:51.960 --> 42:54.167
FARM ANIMALS SOUND
IN STREET

42:56.920 --> 42:59.127
I will never be taken
prisoner again.

43:04.160 --> 43:05.161
Come on.

43:09.240 --> 43:11.527
Thank you, Anne. Yet again.

43:12.200 --> 43:13.929
You should not have paid,
Cousin.

43:15.680 --> 43:18.160
I would give all I possess
to see you free.

43:20.560 --> 43:22.528
He is anxious to speak with you.

43:24.360 --> 43:26.124
Tom.
- We'll go to London.

43:27.400 --> 43:30.483
I'll tell young Robert that his father
is a free man once more.

43:31.200 --> 43:32.361
Hm?

43:41.320 --> 43:43.561
CHURCH BELL TOLLS

43:54.720 --> 43:57.929
You will see Father Garnet himself
has put his name to it.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.241
I do not know this man Garnet.

44:05.280 --> 44:07.282
And I do not know his signature.

44:07.320 --> 44:09.288
Sir, I'm certain you must
know him.

44:10.120 --> 44:12.168
Father Garnet does the Lord's
work in England

44:12.200 --> 44:13.964
at great hazard to his life.

44:16.320 --> 44:20.041
I know neither the man
nor his works.

44:20.080 --> 44:23.050
I must speak with
Sir William Stanley.

44:23.960 --> 44:25.928
This man I do not know either.

44:27.880 --> 44:29.291
TURNER SIGHS

44:33.840 --> 44:35.171
DOOR SHUTS

45:10.600 --> 45:12.921
This is all there is from Turner?
There is nothing more?

45:12.960 --> 45:14.200
Nothing, My Lord.

45:14.840 --> 45:16.922
Our captain has so far failed
even to make

45:16.960 --> 45:19.008
the acquaintance of our prey.

45:19.720 --> 45:22.485
This will not serve for what
I have in mind.

45:23.600 --> 45:25.045
Give me Turner's original.

45:28.640 --> 45:30.608
HE WHISTLES

45:34.240 --> 45:37.483
Ah, to the hunt again,
Sir Philip.

45:37.520 --> 45:39.249
I see you do love the sport.

45:39.280 --> 45:41.567
I love tennis, hunting, dogs
and horses.

45:42.200 --> 45:43.645
Nothing else in the world.

45:44.760 --> 45:46.410
Do you not love
the King, sir?

45:47.320 --> 45:50.244
With all my heart.
- I do believe it.

45:50.280 --> 45:52.806
And His Majesty favours
you handsomely, sir

45:52.840 --> 45:55.810
for your skill in the field,
on the court

45:55.840 --> 45:57.410
and all manner of...

45:58.560 --> 46:00.244
manly pursuits.

46:02.040 --> 46:05.840
The King has been most kind.
- Such is his nature.

46:07.800 --> 46:09.962
Will you help me preserve
the King's life?

46:11.000 --> 46:14.322
I mean, sir, the King is in
mortal danger.

46:14.360 --> 46:19.844
This morning, I received this cipher
from my most reliable espio.

46:19.880 --> 46:23.487
He has penetrated a conspiracy
of desperate Catholics

46:23.520 --> 46:26.251
whose end is to murder
the King

46:26.280 --> 46:29.170
and all those he holds dearest.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.126
Has the King been told?

46:32.440 --> 46:35.887
The King takes counsel from
his Scottish friends only.

46:36.760 --> 46:39.445
You, sir, are the one
Englishman

46:39.480 --> 46:41.244
to whom the King will listen.

46:41.960 --> 46:43.325
If you love the King as you say...

46:43.360 --> 46:44.725
No man loves him better.

46:44.760 --> 46:48.128
Then I must urge you, at all costs,
to convince him

46:48.160 --> 46:51.562
that the threat to his life
is grave

46:52.920 --> 46:54.604
and immediate.

47:10.320 --> 47:13.563
INDISTINCT YELLS AND CHATTER

47:33.880 --> 47:35.370
DOOR UNLOCKS

47:47.800 --> 47:49.450
Go with God, my son.

47:55.080 --> 47:56.206
Robin.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.684
Father Garnet.

48:14.360 --> 48:16.488
I am humiliated.

48:18.480 --> 48:20.847
Despised and impoverished.

48:23.360 --> 48:26.728
I have nothing left except
the kindness of a loving cousin.

48:26.760 --> 48:28.922
GARNET:
You have a son, Robin.

48:29.480 --> 48:31.005
HE POURS WINE

48:32.400 --> 48:34.164
A finer lad I never saw.

48:44.880 --> 48:47.406
The only woman I ever loved
died because of him.

48:50.080 --> 48:51.366
Robin...

48:52.760 --> 48:54.888
You cannot blame your son.

48:57.200 --> 49:01.125
Women know when they conceive
they carry both life and death.

49:02.440 --> 49:05.091
And childbirth is a most
dangerous time.

49:06.160 --> 49:07.969
You're a father, Robin.

49:08.960 --> 49:10.564
You must love your son.

49:12.560 --> 49:14.449
I have no room for love.

49:17.160 --> 49:19.561
Hate I have room for, anger.

49:21.080 --> 49:22.844
Our plight is difficult.

49:24.400 --> 49:25.890
But we have friends at court

49:27.200 --> 49:29.680
who every day plead our cause
to the King.

49:29.720 --> 49:31.324
Do they report success?

49:32.520 --> 49:34.045
How can they?

49:34.080 --> 49:36.686
Whilst Cecil remains in office?

49:36.720 --> 49:39.963
A spider in the middle of his web.

49:43.920 --> 49:47.242
The King has not been moved by
the pleadings of our friends

49:47.280 --> 49:48.691
nor will he be.

49:52.960 --> 49:54.291
Perhaps...

49:58.120 --> 50:00.248
Perhaps he will be moved
by tumult.

50:06.560 --> 50:07.925
What mean you by 'tumult'?

50:07.960 --> 50:09.962
I am not alone, Father.

50:12.360 --> 50:14.761
Not all men possess your patience.

50:18.240 --> 50:20.481
I've nothing to do with
desperate men.

50:21.760 --> 50:23.762
Who would entice you to tumult?

50:24.440 --> 50:25.327
<i>I am...</i>

50:26.280 --> 50:27.645
a desperate man.

50:29.520 --> 50:31.170
Can you not see?

51:29.840 --> 51:31.569
JAMES COUGHS

52:00.840 --> 52:02.490
This is very heavy.

52:03.200 --> 52:06.204
But most necessary
for your security

52:06.240 --> 52:07.605
Your Majesty.

52:10.440 --> 52:13.046
Your care for me
touches me deeply

52:13.080 --> 52:14.445
dearest Philip.

52:20.680 --> 52:23.604
Their numbers swell like rats
in a granary.

52:23.640 --> 52:26.883
They want no more than to practise
their mass quietly in a corner.

52:26.920 --> 52:29.924
HOWARD: Or perhaps you have
your own popish corner in mind!

52:29.960 --> 52:30.961
NORTHUMBERLAND:
I am no papist.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.800
Aye, but you permit papists to swarm
over your household!

52:34.840 --> 52:36.126
There are...

52:36.800 --> 52:39.371
some of my household
that do have...

52:40.480 --> 52:42.050
oars in that boat.
- Ha!

52:42.080 --> 52:44.686
But they are perfectly loyal to His Majesty.
- DOOR OPENS

52:58.920 --> 53:00.206
Gentlemen.

53:01.760 --> 53:03.808
I am persuaded

53:04.440 --> 53:06.204
and, uh, convinced

53:07.280 --> 53:10.409
that there are abroad in
the land evildoers

53:10.440 --> 53:12.329
intent even on murder.

53:12.360 --> 53:14.601
It is our pleasure to summon
the Parliament

53:14.640 --> 53:18.531
to devise new and timely laws
for the certain suppression

53:18.560 --> 53:20.483
of these wicked designs.

53:23.240 --> 53:28.201
Spain will not countenance
a more severe persecution.

53:28.720 --> 53:31.121
The peace you seek will be lost.

53:31.160 --> 53:33.288
HOWARD:
This is England, sir.

53:33.320 --> 53:35.846
Our laws are naught to
do with Spain.

53:40.800 --> 53:43.451
CHICKENS CLUCK

53:45.520 --> 53:47.841
INDISTINCT CHATTER

53:49.760 --> 53:51.569
DOG BARKS

54:02.440 --> 54:03.521
Robin.

54:05.240 --> 54:06.810
You are come.

54:10.240 --> 54:11.446
Jack.

54:12.760 --> 54:15.001
How are you?
- I'm well, Robin.

54:16.360 --> 54:17.441
What is he doing here?

54:18.600 --> 54:21.604
We are going to have need
of men like Jack Wright.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.241
INDISTINCT CHATTER
IN DUTCH

54:36.400 --> 54:37.811
Captain Turner.

54:37.840 --> 54:40.161
I am come from
Sir William Stanley.

54:49.080 --> 54:50.684
Where are you taking me,
Farwell?

54:50.720 --> 54:53.291
You wish to have conversation
with Sir William, do you not?

54:53.320 --> 54:56.529
I do.
- Then gather your courage.

54:56.560 --> 54:58.289
And follow me.

55:07.440 --> 55:09.727
CHURCH BELL TOLLS

55:18.360 --> 55:20.408
We need to strike at the root, Tom.

55:21.160 --> 55:24.528
The nature of the disease requires
so sharp a remedy.

55:28.400 --> 55:30.323
CROWD:
God save the King!

55:30.360 --> 55:31.850
God save the King!

55:31.880 --> 55:32.802
God save the King!

55:38.240 --> 55:40.129
This is Turner?
- Yes.

55:47.480 --> 55:48.641
What do you want with Stanley?

55:49.120 --> 55:51.566
I wish to dedicate my life
to his cause.

55:56.080 --> 55:57.969
SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC SWELLS

56:01.520 --> 56:03.966
What do you know of any cause,
Turner?

56:08.400 --> 56:12.371
You are a light
and dissolute fellow.

56:13.360 --> 56:16.569
You're no man for any cause
but your own.

56:16.600 --> 56:20.047
I've been changed
thanks to the grace of God.

56:22.720 --> 56:25.246
FARWELL: He has a
laissez-passer signed by Garnet.

56:31.080 --> 56:32.206
You come armed?

56:33.760 --> 56:36.001
I'm a soldier, like you.

56:39.160 --> 56:43.051
And there is no just cause
but the one true church.

56:43.080 --> 56:46.050
I come to lay down my life
to defend it.

57:10.680 --> 57:12.921
CROWD CHEERS

57:18.600 --> 57:20.125
In that Parliament

57:20.440 --> 57:22.363
have they done us all
this mischief.

57:25.240 --> 57:28.289
Perhaps God has designed
that place for their punishment.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.684
Who are you?

57:45.760 --> 57:47.205
My name...

57:49.560 --> 57:51.528
is Guy Fawkes.

57:51.560 --> 57:54.131
HE STABS TURNER
