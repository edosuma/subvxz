Yes.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.787

No. He cut a deal with

wanted Caffrey dead?

01:48.150 --> 01:51.820
Neal was a felon.
He was convicted of bond forgery.

01:51.904 --> 01:53.655
And as you can see in those files,

01:53.739 --> 01:56.325
he was suspected of doing
a hell of a lot of other things.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.368
Yeah, Neal was a pain in the ass.

01:58.452 --> 02:02.206
So did somebody from that past
want him dead? Maybe.

02:02.289 --> 02:05.334
But he also helped me clear
a 93 percent conviction rate,

02:05.417 --> 02:06.960
and that makes enemies too.

02:07.044 --> 02:10.214
But I don't think any of this
explains why the jet exploded.

02:10.297 --> 02:13.175
You want an answer to that,
ask Garrett Fowler.

02:13.258 --> 02:16.803
Fowler, the OPR agent you shot.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.388
He was wearing a vest.

at 12th and Watershed two months from now.

14:46.220 --> 14:49.681
I kept everything as you left it.

14:51.683 --> 14:54.353
-Exactly as I left it, I see.
-Oh, welcome back.

14:54.436 --> 14:57.231
I couldn't bear the thought of you
at that motel.

14:57.314 --> 15:01.401
Besides, you can't imagine how quiet it is
around here without you.

15:01.485 --> 15:04.863
I like a little, uh,
excitement now and then.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.907
-Me too.
-(CHUCKLES)

15:07.824 --> 15:10.494
-Thank you, June.
-Of course.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.916
Let's see it.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.168
-There's a lot.
-I know.

15:32.057 --> 15:34.434
This is everything?

15:34.518 --> 15:40.774
Yeah. Everything on your search
for Kate, Fowler, Mentor.

15:40.858 --> 15:42.693
-You heard from Alex?
-No.

15:42.776 --> 15:46.822
Since the explosion,
she's been laying low. Can't blame her.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.699
She'll surface.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.367
NEAL: What about the music box?

15:50.450 --> 15:52.911
According to the evidence log,
the new lady suit…

15:52.995 --> 15:54.788
-That would be Diana.
-Diana logged it

15:54.872 --> 15:58.542
into evidence in your New York office
after Peter recovered it from Fowler.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.002
I want to see if it's still there.

16:00.085 --> 16:02.129
Whoever blew up the plane wants that box.

16:02.212 --> 16:04.840
They're not gonna let it sit around
in an evidence locker collecting dust.

16:05.716 --> 16:08.802
We find the person who wants the box,
we find who killed Kate.

16:12.556 --> 16:13.849
(SIGHS)

16:17.978 --> 16:21.190
The Architect.
That's an excellent sobriquet.

16:21.273 --> 16:24.109
-Is this your first case back?
-Yeah.

16:29.072 --> 16:32.701
-I need a new nickname.
-Mozzie's not cutting it anymore?

16:32.784 --> 16:37.039
What about, um, The Question?
Or perhaps The Skeptic?

16:38.415 --> 16:39.416
Conman?

16:41.001 --> 16:43.587
The Architect, he's a bank robber?

16:43.670 --> 16:46.465
A good one. Since when are you
concerned with FBI cases?

16:46.548 --> 16:50.177
Uh, since you started spiraling
into the dark place.

16:51.595 --> 16:55.849
And as you may remember, I have colluded
on a bank heist or two in my day.

16:55.933 --> 16:57.893
Come on.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.895
What do we got?

16:59.978 --> 17:05.150
All right. Three clean jobs in five years.
No trail, no evidence.

17:05.234 --> 17:07.277
All we have are these business cards.

17:07.361 --> 17:10.197
Embossed. Very classy. Hmm.

17:10.280 --> 17:13.158
What do make of the "A"?
I don't recognize the typeface.

17:13.242 --> 17:15.827
-Forensics doesn't either.
-Custom font.

17:15.911 --> 17:19.373
-That speaks to a high degree of hubris.
-Mmm-hmm.

17:19.456 --> 17:20.791
What do you think?

17:20.874 --> 17:23.126
The elongated slant,
it could be a Cyrillic influence.

17:24.002 --> 17:26.004
-A little Russian.
-Mmm-hmm.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.382
If you left a calling card,
how would you sign it?

17:28.465 --> 17:31.176
I would never leave a card.
It's way too brazen. Would you?

17:32.886 --> 17:34.513
Of course you would.

17:34.596 --> 17:38.433
The better question is, if you were him,
what card would you leave?

17:44.064 --> 17:47.484
-Morning.
-Found something on the card.

17:49.278 --> 17:51.697
I'll take Obscure Russian Painters
for 1000.

17:51.780 --> 17:53.782
The "A" has a definite Cyrillic influence.

17:53.866 --> 17:56.285
Well, our tech guys
already cracked that one.

17:56.368 --> 17:58.287
If The Architect is a mad Russian,

17:58.370 --> 18:00.247
that doesn't narrow down
our list of possibles.

18:00.330 --> 18:03.041
Not a Russian,
but a fan of Russian painting.

18:03.876 --> 18:06.295
Ivan Aivazovsky. Look at his signature.

18:08.422 --> 18:10.507
Oh, look at that.

18:11.383 --> 18:12.551
Got it.

18:13.886 --> 18:16.305
Look at you two working together.
Look at that teamwork.

18:16.388 --> 18:18.891
We dug up every auction
in the last two years to see

18:18.974 --> 18:20.267
who's been bidding on Aivazovskys.

18:20.350 --> 18:22.186
Excellent. That's a pretty thick list.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.729
What if we cross-reference people

18:23.812 --> 18:26.523
with a business connection
in Dallas, Chicago…

18:26.607 --> 18:28.358
-Right here.
-Oh.

18:28.442 --> 18:30.402
-Yeah, the list gets shorter.
-NEAL: One name.

18:31.904 --> 18:33.697
Edward Walker.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.490
-Let's go have a visit.
-Let's do it.

18:35.574 --> 18:38.702
Good work. Good work.

18:40.704 --> 18:41.955
(CHUCKLES)

18:44.082 --> 18:47.461
Mr. Walker,
these gentlemen are with the FBI.

18:47.544 --> 18:50.255
Well, if you're here to give me
a ticket for hitting golf balls

18:50.339 --> 18:52.174
into the Hudson River,
I'll have to write you a check.

18:52.257 --> 18:55.385
-Whitney, get me my checkbook, would you?
-The Bureau doesn't give tickets.

18:55.469 --> 18:58.180
Well, in that case, Whitney,
get my golf permit, will you?

19:05.687 --> 19:09.399
I'm Special Agent Peter Burke.
This is my consultant, Neal Caffrey.

19:10.067 --> 19:11.985
What do you consult on, Mr. Caffrey?

19:12.069 --> 19:14.947
Investigations that involve
my areas of expertise.

19:15.030 --> 19:16.532
What areas are those?

19:16.615 --> 19:17.866
It's a long list.

19:21.286 --> 19:23.705
-Here, try a swing.
-No, thanks.

19:23.789 --> 19:26.250
Oh. When was the last time
you got a chance

19:26.333 --> 19:28.335
to hit a golf ball
off the top of the world?

19:29.670 --> 19:31.129
(CHUCKLES)

19:32.381 --> 19:33.924
Oh, okay.

19:37.636 --> 19:40.097
-You recognize this?
-Oh, I'm not an architect.

19:40.180 --> 19:44.226
No, you're just a hedge fund manager
with too much time on his hands.

19:44.309 --> 19:46.645
Well, having a hobby
is not illegal, is it?

19:46.728 --> 19:48.230
Depends on the hobby.

19:48.313 --> 19:51.149
Is there something specific
I can help you with, Agent Burke?

19:51.233 --> 19:53.694
Contemporary Russian art.
Got any Aivazovskys?

19:53.777 --> 19:56.280
Three. You thinking about stealing one?

19:57.030 --> 19:58.949
It's that device on your ankle.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.118
Ooh, you must have been
some kind of criminal

20:01.201 --> 20:03.287
for the FBI to want to keep you so close.

20:03.745 --> 20:04.746
I was.

20:07.541 --> 20:12.045
Ooh, you sliced that one
over into the Chelsea Pier.

20:12.629 --> 20:15.132
You know, my permit doesn't cover that.

20:16.884 --> 20:20.387
I understand you have offices
in Dallas, Chicago and Boston.

20:20.470 --> 20:23.015
I have offices in most major cities
around the world.

20:23.098 --> 20:25.934
Could you tell me where you were
on April 19th of last year?

20:26.018 --> 20:28.812
WALKER: Off the top of my head?
I have no idea.

20:28.896 --> 20:30.564
But my assistant could look it up for me.

20:30.647 --> 20:35.068
Uh, Whitney keeps my calendar.
Uh, April 19th?

20:35.152 --> 20:39.281
Oh, of course, I know exactly where I was,
and I would be happy to tell you,

20:39.364 --> 20:40.949
providing you can get a warrant

20:41.033 --> 20:42.701
based on some bizarre
connection you've made

20:42.784 --> 20:47.247
between me, an anonymous business card,
and random questions about Russian art.

20:47.331 --> 20:51.835
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I, uh, have too much time on my hands.

20:52.753 --> 20:53.962
Whitney can show you out.

20:57.674 --> 21:00.093
Oh, and, Mister, uh, Caffrey,

21:00.177 --> 21:02.846
a suggestion for the next time
you commit a crime.

21:03.388 --> 21:04.515
Don't get caught.

21:05.682 --> 21:09.019
And… On your backswing,

21:09.102 --> 21:11.396
just keep it smooth.

21:14.525 --> 21:15.734
Yeah.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.496
-Did Walker get to you?
-Nope.

21:27.579 --> 21:30.165
But I hope he did it.
Be fun to arrest him.

21:30.249 --> 21:32.835
-He got to you. Don't do anything stupid.
-I won't.

21:32.918 --> 21:34.878
Don't tell me it's not
in the realm of possibility.

21:34.962 --> 21:36.964
We are under a ton of scrutiny here.

21:37.047 --> 21:38.632
-Both of us.
-Got it.

21:39.675 --> 21:43.554
So why would somebody like him do it?
He doesn't need the money.

21:43.637 --> 21:45.722
The guy's chipping
golf balls off skyscrapers.

21:45.806 --> 21:46.849
You said it. He's bored.

21:46.932 --> 21:49.893
So he's gonna risk prison
for an adrenaline rush?

21:49.977 --> 21:52.229
-Yep.
-Huh.

21:52.312 --> 21:55.440
Listen, I'm gonna head back to the office
and grab a late bite with El.

21:55.524 --> 21:58.026
-We're done for the day.
-Tell Elizabeth I say hi.

21:58.110 --> 22:00.821
-Neal, nothing stupid.
-Nothing stupid.

22:06.451 --> 22:09.913
Talk to the FAA. We need flight records,
commercial and private.

22:09.997 --> 22:12.875
I want to know if Walker was in Dallas,
Chicago or Boston

22:12.958 --> 22:14.877
-on the dates of the robberies.
-Done.

22:14.960 --> 22:16.920
I'll run credit cards
and phone records as well.

22:17.004 --> 22:18.964
Maybe get him making a call
or place him at a hotel.

22:19.047 --> 22:20.841
Thanks, Jones. Let me know what you find.

22:26.054 --> 22:27.598
I checked your calendar.

22:27.681 --> 22:31.268
Fowler's mystery meeting is in three days.
These are the locations?

22:31.351 --> 22:34.605
Very little foot traffic, no cameras,
several alley exit points.

22:34.688 --> 22:37.024
-I see why Fowler picked it.
-I'm gonna be there.

22:37.107 --> 22:38.275
We both should be.

22:43.155 --> 22:44.573
-Oh!
-Oh, sorry.

22:44.656 --> 22:46.325
-These tables are so close…
-Hey.

22:46.408 --> 22:48.535
-Whitney.
-Mr. Caffrey?

22:48.619 --> 22:50.913
-Please, Neal, Neal.
-Great.

22:50.996 --> 22:53.290
That's what I love about New York.
Small world.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.918
Yeah. Please, sit down. Join me?

22:56.001 --> 22:57.294
-You sure?
-Please, sit down.

22:58.795 --> 23:02.090
Cape Cod? What a relief to meet
someone else who's over the Hamptons.

23:02.174 --> 23:05.219
I know. I always felt
like I was in a Fitzgerald novel.

23:05.302 --> 23:07.387
Maybe it's just 'cause
I'm not from New York.

23:07.471 --> 23:08.722
Kindred ex-patriot.

23:11.141 --> 23:13.018
Would you like another glass of wine?

23:14.269 --> 23:17.022
Yeah, let's.

23:17.105 --> 23:19.942
PETER: You know, this is nice.
ELIZABETH: It is nice.

23:20.025 --> 23:21.818
You live here,
you forget what's right in front of you.

23:21.902 --> 23:24.488
Yeah. (CHUCKLES) How's Neal doing?

23:25.781 --> 23:29.159
Great. As far as he says.

23:29.243 --> 23:31.620
He's putting up a facade, huh?

23:31.703 --> 23:33.830
Of course he is. It's his natural state.

23:33.914 --> 23:38.126
-Problem is, I don't know how bad it is.
-What do you think?

23:38.210 --> 23:40.504
I think he went through
one hell of a trauma.

23:40.587 --> 23:43.382
I also think if he was ready
for a straitjacket,

23:43.465 --> 23:46.426
he'd be grinning and saying,
"Peter, you have to trust me."

23:46.510 --> 23:49.304
Well, it's gonna take him some time
to become himself again.

23:50.889 --> 23:53.392
So you actually prefer Nantucket
over Martha's Vineyard?

23:53.475 --> 23:55.185
Yeah, yeah. It's…
It's a sentimental thing.

23:55.269 --> 23:57.521
Absolutely. Let's go international.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.523
Oh, Maldives, hands down.

23:59.606 --> 24:02.484
Those turquoise waters are unreal.

24:02.568 --> 24:05.821
-That an acceptable answer?
-Very good.

24:05.904 --> 24:07.406
-Mine's the Seychelles.
-Yeah?

24:07.489 --> 24:09.408
Do you know the sand's actually pink?

24:09.491 --> 24:11.535
-Wow.
-Yeah, it's actually pink.

24:11.618 --> 24:12.870
NEAL: Wow.

24:12.953 --> 24:14.454
(BEEPING)

24:17.749 --> 24:19.251
All right, I'm gonna get you
another drink,

24:19.334 --> 24:21.253
but when I come back, European cities.

24:21.336 --> 24:23.380
And you are not allowed to say Barcelona.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.757
-Ooh.
-(CHUCKLES)

24:25.841 --> 24:29.303
-Does he know?
-Not how bad it is.

24:29.386 --> 24:32.598
Well, he knows that we're under
enhanced scrutiny by the Bureau.

24:32.681 --> 24:36.727
What he doesn't know is if we drop a case,
I'm collecting unemployment,

24:36.810 --> 24:40.230
and he's using pictures
of Macaulay Culkin for money.

24:40.314 --> 24:42.566
-(CHUCKLES)
-There was this moment

24:42.649 --> 24:44.276
right before the plane exploded.

24:44.943 --> 24:46.695
Neal was walking away from me.

24:47.821 --> 24:52.117
He stopped and he turned around
and he was about to say something.

24:53.160 --> 24:54.453
Then…

24:55.913 --> 24:57.664
What do you think he was gonna say?

24:58.540 --> 24:59.958
I don't know.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.588
-Do you think he was gonna stay?
-And leave Kate?

25:06.298 --> 25:08.383
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

25:08.467 --> 25:10.385
Well, I think it matters.

25:10.469 --> 25:12.471
Why? It's kind of a moot point now.

25:12.554 --> 25:13.847
It matters to you.

25:13.931 --> 25:15.849
(SIGHS)

25:20.896 --> 25:22.606
Copied her SIM card.

25:22.689 --> 25:25.400
Too bad you're conning this one.
She's cute.

25:25.484 --> 25:27.194
Yeah, I noticed.

25:27.277 --> 25:30.113
-Be cruel to be kind.
-Yeah, you're right.

25:32.241 --> 25:33.951
Truth hurts, Mozz.

25:39.164 --> 25:41.667
You know, I've gotta show you
these photos from Morocco.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.335
-Yeah.
-They are in my phone,

25:43.418 --> 25:45.587
which is in my giant handbag somewhere.

25:45.671 --> 25:46.713
Maybe it's on the table.

25:46.797 --> 25:48.799
I'm always leaving my stuff
like right in front of me.

25:48.882 --> 25:49.967
It could be. No.

25:50.050 --> 25:51.468
No, it's in here.

25:51.552 --> 25:53.053
-Here it is.
-There you go.

25:53.929 --> 25:59.226
Um, you know, do you want to look
at these back at my place?

26:00.394 --> 26:02.896
-Where's that?
-Gramercy Park.

26:02.980 --> 26:05.190
Yeah, that's within my radius.

26:05.858 --> 26:08.235
-Your what?
-Oh, um… (CHUCKLES)

26:10.737 --> 26:12.406
Is that a tracking anklet?

26:12.489 --> 26:16.618
Electronic monitoring anklet actually.
It's a… It's a funny story though.

26:16.702 --> 26:18.829
A couple years ago, the feds came after me

26:18.912 --> 26:21.331
for everything from art theft
to counterfeiting.

26:21.415 --> 26:23.250
The only thing they got me
on was bond forgery.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.460
(LAUGHS) I thought you worked for the FBI.

26:25.544 --> 26:29.464
Oh, yeah, yeah, with Peter.
He caught me. Both times.

26:29.548 --> 26:32.134
Anyway, this is a big day for me.

26:32.217 --> 26:35.137
You're the first girl I've had a drink
with since I got out of prison.

26:35.220 --> 26:36.221
Wow.

26:36.305 --> 26:38.932
That's not…
That's not a problem, is it? Or…

26:40.684 --> 26:43.228
I should really go.

26:44.104 --> 26:46.273
Okay. Is it something I said? Are you…

26:46.356 --> 26:49.735
You know where to find me.
(CHUCKLES) Have a good one.

26:50.444 --> 26:51.778
(SIGHS)

26:51.862 --> 26:54.781
Neal Caffrey on paper, not so great.

26:54.865 --> 26:56.325
It's a lot to process.

26:56.408 --> 27:00.037
-Well, at least we got Walker's calendar.
-Anything?

27:00.120 --> 27:05.417
On the days of the previous bank heists,
his itinerary is highlighted in green.

27:05.501 --> 27:08.253
-Usually it's blue.
-Green for money.

27:08.337 --> 27:11.757
Oh, really? The symbolism had escaped me.

27:11.840 --> 27:12.841
Look at tomorrow.

27:12.925 --> 27:15.427
He's got a meeting
at First Unity Bank at noon.

27:15.511 --> 27:17.179
Marked in green.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.139
I think we got him.

27:24.144 --> 27:27.606
You happened to run into her
and then she invited you for a drink?

27:27.689 --> 27:29.191
Gotta love New York.

27:29.274 --> 27:31.818
Yeah, and then she handed you
a copy of her SIM card.

27:31.902 --> 27:33.737
I'm a confidential informant, right?

27:33.820 --> 27:35.906
If someone found this
information on the street

27:35.989 --> 27:37.908
and brought it to you, you wouldn't blink.

27:37.991 --> 27:39.243
I told you, nothing stupid.

27:40.494 --> 27:43.205
Well, word on the street
is that Walker's gonna hit

27:43.288 --> 27:45.082
the First Unity branch tomorrow at noon.

27:47.543 --> 27:49.711
-You're sure about this?
-Oh, yeah.

27:56.426 --> 27:58.387
PETER: We've got everybody in position.

27:58.470 --> 28:00.681
What makes you sure
this bank is the target?

28:00.764 --> 28:03.058
-Word on the street.
-I don't understand.

28:03.141 --> 28:04.893
Why don't you think this bank is secure?

28:04.977 --> 28:07.604
They haven't had time to install
half the security measures we recommended.

28:07.688 --> 28:09.314
-You've been inside?
-I'm very thorough.

28:09.398 --> 28:13.819
Well, we've reset the vault doors
in all of our locations to change daily.

28:13.902 --> 28:16.196
There's no way they're getting in there
without the access codes.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.698
JONES: These guys have bravado
and then some.

28:17.781 --> 28:20.409
Dallas was hit at 9:00 a.m.
Chicago, at the lunch hour.

28:20.492 --> 28:21.869
PETER: What?

28:21.952 --> 28:23.954
The northwest guard takes lunch at noon.

28:24.037 --> 28:25.247

28:34.923 --> 28:36.884
-Do you see anyone?
<i>-Nobody down here.</i>

28:36.967 --> 28:38.468
They could've disabled
the motion detectors

28:38.552 --> 28:40.762
-and bypassed those cameras.
-All units go.

28:40.846 --> 28:42.806

what triggered that alarm.

28:42.890 --> 28:44.766

28:53.066 --> 28:54.776
Jones, take the monitor.

28:57.571 --> 28:59.865
-PETER: What's going on?
-This another one of your bank tests?

28:59.948 --> 29:03.118
-What do you mean?
-That was inside a safety-deposit box.

29:03.202 --> 29:06.038
-Whose name was on the box?
-Peter Burke.

29:06.121 --> 29:09.625
Someone's messing with you, Burke.
In the future, don't waste my time.

29:09.708 --> 29:11.460
Don't waste my men's time.

29:11.543 --> 29:14.588
WALKER: Well, well, well,
if it isn't Agent Burke

29:14.671 --> 29:16.548
and his personal criminal consultant.

29:16.632 --> 29:17.966
What a coincidence.

29:18.050 --> 29:20.177
-Odd seeing you here, Walker.
-Why is that?

29:20.260 --> 29:22.429
I have a meeting right across the street
at the Nix Towers.

29:22.513 --> 29:24.765
I guess we missed all the excitement.

29:25.682 --> 29:26.725
Nice clock.

29:28.310 --> 29:29.394
Gentlemen.

29:31.980 --> 29:34.525
-He played me, Pete.
-Yeah.

29:34.608 --> 29:36.151
Now we got problems.

29:44.284 --> 29:46.662
(INAUDIBLE)

29:46.745 --> 29:48.622
They've been in there for almost an hour.

29:48.705 --> 29:50.457
-Yeah.
-You think we'll lose the case?

29:50.541 --> 29:53.252
With the Department of Justice,
we'll be lucky if that's all that happens.

29:53.335 --> 29:55.254
Come on. We were set up. They know that.

29:55.337 --> 29:57.381
Yeah, and they think Peter
should've known that.

29:57.464 --> 30:00.259
This is the FBI, Neal.
We don't act unless we're sure.

30:00.342 --> 30:01.718
Peter trusted your lead.

30:12.604 --> 30:14.940
So today was a bit of a setback.

30:15.023 --> 30:18.193
You think? Took me a while
to wipe the egg off of my face.

30:18.277 --> 30:22.281
-We can catch this guy.
-This guy is no longer our investigation.

30:24.867 --> 30:25.993
This is bad.

30:27.035 --> 30:28.495
There's something you should know.

30:29.872 --> 30:34.334
When we were at the hangar that day,
before everything happened,

30:34.418 --> 30:35.961
I was gonna tell you something.

30:36.962 --> 30:37.963
What?

30:41.717 --> 30:43.177
I didn't want to run anymore.

30:44.636 --> 30:48.056
If I had gotten on that plane,
regardless of whatever deal was made,

30:48.140 --> 30:49.683
it wouldn't have felt like freedom.

30:49.766 --> 30:52.019
-Why?
-Because it was an escape.

30:52.102 --> 30:55.522
You're right, Peter. I have a life here.

30:56.190 --> 30:59.526
If there was something you could've done
to protect Kate, I know you would've.

30:59.610 --> 31:01.028
I would've.

31:01.111 --> 31:03.530
The same way I know you can get Walker.

31:03.614 --> 31:04.656
(CHUCKLES)

31:06.116 --> 31:08.035
It's not fun being tweaked
by the bad guy, is it?

31:08.118 --> 31:10.245
Especially when you, say, make
one of your friends look like an idiot.

31:10.329 --> 31:11.788
-What?
-Not that you…

31:11.872 --> 31:13.332
-You didn't look…
-Little bit, yeah.

31:13.415 --> 31:14.583
But you kind of… Yeah.

31:16.043 --> 31:18.921
All right, let's start from the top.

31:19.004 --> 31:21.673
Why would he send a card to warn the bank?

31:21.757 --> 31:24.510
-To challenge us?
-For what purpose?

31:25.219 --> 31:27.387
To see if we're on his level. It's a test.

31:27.471 --> 31:30.140
There's no fun in playing the game
unless you have a worthy opponent.

31:30.224 --> 31:31.725
He wants to see if we're as good as he is.

31:31.808 --> 31:32.851
-Go back.
-What?

31:32.935 --> 31:34.478
-You said test.
-Yeah, to see what we'd do.

31:34.561 --> 31:36.563
-What did we do?
-We ran the…

31:38.315 --> 31:39.942
We ran the security.

31:40.025 --> 31:42.444
We revealed the bank's weaknesses to him.

31:42.528 --> 31:45.739
I wonder if the Bureau had security tests

31:45.822 --> 31:48.283
on the other cities' banks
before the robberies.

31:48.367 --> 31:50.035
-Who are you calling?
-Jones.

31:50.118 --> 31:51.662
-(RINGING)
-Oh, look at that, ESP.

31:51.745 --> 31:55.332
-Jones, I was just calling you.

-I can't get anybody from NYPD.
-He's spreading us thin.

32:13.392 --> 32:16.270
-It's another misdirect.
-None of these banks got Walker's cards.

32:16.353 --> 32:20.357
-He's going after one of the initial five.
-You got that right.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.526
Renee said she changed
the vault access codes.

32:22.609 --> 32:23.861
No one can get in without her.

32:23.944 --> 32:25.863
We gotta find her
before someone else does.

Their alarms are going off again.
Half the banks in town are being robbed.

-PETER: <i>I don't think so.</i>
-You think it's a smokescreen?

33:06.236 --> 33:08.572
Yup. Neal and I are headed
to Midtown Mutual.

Midtown's one of the few that's silent.

33:10.365 --> 33:12.743
-Exactly.
-If Walker's crew are there,

33:12.826 --> 33:13.952
you can't go in without backup.

33:14.036 --> 33:16.872
Then get us some. I got a feeling
they're going after Renee.

39:07.431 --> 39:09.474
Let them go. They've got guns. Neal!

39:09.558 --> 39:11.393
Damn it. He never listens to me.

39:11.476 --> 39:13.604
(CHATTERING)

39:32.331 --> 39:34.583
Jones, get me Walker.
I want to talk to him.

39:34.666 --> 39:35.709
He's already here.

39:38.712 --> 39:40.506
Oh, I heard what happened at the bank.

39:40.589 --> 39:42.382
I thought maybe
I could save you some trouble.

39:42.466 --> 39:45.761
-So you're here to confess?
-(CHUCKLES)

39:45.844 --> 39:47.554
I figured you were gonna give me a call,

39:47.638 --> 39:49.890
because I'm sure
Mr. Caffrey has my cell number.

39:49.973 --> 39:51.558
Arthur?

39:51.642 --> 39:55.103
You'll find my alibi in there
in addition to my company's lawsuit.

39:55.187 --> 39:56.688
Lawsuit?

39:56.772 --> 39:59.816
Yes, unwarranted harassment,
defamation of character.

39:59.900 --> 40:01.735
And, you know,
there's a litany of other charges,

40:01.818 --> 40:03.654
but, gee, why spoil the surprise?

40:03.737 --> 40:07.908
Enjoy this game you're playing.
It won't end well for you.

40:07.991 --> 40:10.077
Oh, the game is already over.

40:10.160 --> 40:14.373
This Architect, whoever he is,
has already won.

40:16.333 --> 40:17.668
Mr. Caffrey.

40:18.669 --> 40:20.796
Oh, if I did do it,

40:20.879 --> 40:24.049
do you think they would make me
a junior FBI agent too?

40:30.347 --> 40:32.182
Wow, that is one arrogant bastard.

40:32.266 --> 40:34.768
(SCOFFS) That's one way of putting it.

40:35.769 --> 40:37.396
This is gonna be a problem.

40:46.446 --> 40:47.906
PETER: Nothing useful on the tapes.

40:47.990 --> 40:49.741
They were in and out in five minutes.

40:49.825 --> 40:52.119
Gridlocked half the city
to kill your response time.

40:52.202 --> 40:53.620
Plus, they had a perfect exit strategy.

40:53.704 --> 40:55.831
Walker was in control
every step of the way.

40:55.914 --> 40:58.000
-He wants us to know it.
-And that's how we get him.

40:58.083 --> 40:59.668
The one thing he can't control is his ego.

40:59.751 --> 41:01.503
Vanity is not cause for indictment.

41:01.587 --> 41:04.715
I was never bold enough to walk into
your office when you were after me.

41:04.798 --> 41:06.008
I want this guy.

41:06.091 --> 41:08.510
Hell hath no fury like a fed scorned.

41:08.594 --> 41:10.762
We are facing
a multi-million-dollar lawsuit

41:10.846 --> 41:13.807
from a suspected thief
who walked away from the crime scene

41:13.891 --> 41:16.518
-in broad daylight.
-What, are you saying we're done?

41:16.602 --> 41:19.646
We better not be.
Otherwise, I can't stop the DOJ

41:19.730 --> 41:21.773
from putting me on the bread line
and you behind bars.

41:21.857 --> 41:24.735
Come on. While they were chasing ghosts
around the city, we were right.

41:24.818 --> 41:27.070
It doesn't matter. We didn't catch him.

41:27.905 --> 41:29.156
Final tally.

41:30.199 --> 41:32.618
Looks like they got away
with $8.2 million.

41:37.581 --> 41:40.334
-You sure about that?
-Jones has excellent penmanship.

41:41.502 --> 41:43.795
Four guys, two Samsonites each.

41:43.879 --> 41:45.839
Peter, about how big
would you say the briefcases are?

41:45.923 --> 41:48.300
I don't know, 16-by-13.

41:48.383 --> 41:50.385
-Height?
-Four, five inches.

41:50.469 --> 41:52.179
Denomination of the bills,
all Franklins, right?

41:52.262 --> 41:54.598
-Right.
-Hundred bills in a pack.

41:54.681 --> 41:56.808
The volume of each pack
is less than eight inches.

41:56.892 --> 41:58.101
Dimensions don't add up.

41:58.185 --> 42:01.688
We're looking at around
$960,000 in each case.

42:01.772 --> 42:03.524
That's over $6.5 million total.

42:03.607 --> 42:05.275
The final tally was 8.2.

42:05.359 --> 42:07.736
Which means that more than
a million and a half is unaccounted for.

42:08.320 --> 42:09.988
Sounds like enough to be a share.

42:15.035 --> 42:16.453
-Thank you.
-Sure.

42:16.537 --> 42:18.664
PETER: I appreciate your taking the time.

42:18.747 --> 42:20.165
You said you had a theory.

42:20.249 --> 42:23.168
Our faceless friends
may have left something behind.

42:23.252 --> 42:26.129
I'd like to re-examine the vault,
just in case.

42:26.213 --> 42:27.798
No rest for the weary, huh?

42:27.881 --> 42:31.218
Those creeps held a gun to my head.
I'll rest when you catch them.

42:33.470 --> 42:35.055
(BUZZER SOUNDS)

42:35.138 --> 42:37.182
RENEE: The team was pretty thorough.

42:37.266 --> 42:38.892
What is it you think that they missed?

42:42.521 --> 42:45.274
-Two-thirteen.
-Excuse me?

42:45.357 --> 42:49.403
Deposit box 213.
Pretty sure no one's looked in there yet.

42:49.486 --> 42:52.447
-It sounds like it's worth a shot.
-Uh, I'm sorry, gentlemen.

42:52.531 --> 42:54.783
That's the property
of one of our customers.

42:54.867 --> 42:56.410
You'd need his authorization or a warrant.

42:56.493 --> 42:57.995
Got this from the bank president.

42:58.078 --> 43:01.164
But the box doesn't belong
to one of your customers.

43:01.248 --> 43:03.375
-It belongs to you.
-(SCOFFS)

43:04.293 --> 43:05.752
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

43:05.836 --> 43:09.548
No, we did a background check
on all the boxes in this vault.

43:09.631 --> 43:12.217
Did you know 213 was rented
to your uncle two months ago?

43:12.301 --> 43:14.428
I don't see why that would be a problem.

43:14.511 --> 43:16.597
PETER: I do. He died two years ago.

43:16.680 --> 43:18.765
-Either it's a miracle…
-Or you forged his application.

43:18.849 --> 43:21.101
My money's on the latter.

43:21.185 --> 43:22.728
(LAUGHS)

43:23.478 --> 43:26.940
Okay, fine. Um, why don't you have a look?

43:37.951 --> 43:38.952
PETER: Wow.

43:41.663 --> 43:44.249
One and a half million dollars in cash.

43:45.459 --> 43:46.835
All right.

43:47.961 --> 43:50.214
-Did you know she had a gun?
-I did not.

43:50.297 --> 43:52.508
Okay, get the bag.
And put the money in the bag.

43:55.844 --> 43:57.387
Not a bad plan.

43:57.471 --> 43:58.889
Walker leaves your cut,

43:58.972 --> 44:01.725
and all you have to do is walk out with it
once the dust settles.

44:01.808 --> 44:04.937
-Pretty good plan, I'd say.
-Except we figured it out.

44:05.020 --> 44:07.064
You really think you can outrun the FBI?

44:07.147 --> 44:09.233
For the record,
it's a marathon, not a sprint.

44:09.316 --> 44:10.317
He would know.

44:10.400 --> 44:12.236
Stop talking and put the money in the bag.

44:12.319 --> 44:14.571
That was a pretty nice acting job
you did for the cameras.

44:14.655 --> 44:17.533
-Even the best laid plans.
-RENEE: Shut up.

44:18.408 --> 44:20.744
Walker convinced you to help him,
didn't he?

44:20.827 --> 44:25.999
He convinced me I shouldn't wait 20 years
to have a mediocre pension to retire on.

44:26.083 --> 44:28.293
Why wait when I can have
three times that right now?

44:28.377 --> 44:30.921
-Because you'll get caught.
-Again, he would know.

44:31.004 --> 44:32.548
Did I tell you to stop?

44:33.674 --> 44:34.925
Keep filling the bag.

44:36.093 --> 44:38.053
Could you stop doing that, please?

44:38.136 --> 44:39.513
-What?
-Rubbing it in.

44:39.596 --> 44:41.765
-It's very hypocritical.
-Well, it's not untrue.

44:41.849 --> 44:43.267
-Hey!
-Okay, you know what?

44:43.350 --> 44:45.394
-I'm tired of this.
-Being held hostage?

44:45.477 --> 44:47.729
-No, bickering with you.
-Well, you're not the only one.

44:47.813 --> 44:48.981
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

44:49.064 --> 44:51.859
Wow. Okay, maybe it is time
for this partnership to end.

44:51.942 --> 44:54.611
Okay, that's fine by me.
I can finally start my novel.

44:54.695 --> 44:56.613
Novel? You can barely
write a parking ticket.

44:56.697 --> 44:58.156
-You know, that's very…
-Hey!

44:58.240 --> 44:59.241
BOTH: Hold on.

44:59.324 --> 45:01.201
-You really want this to end?
-Do you?

45:01.285 --> 45:02.786
-I'm ready.
-Let's do it.

45:02.870 --> 45:04.329
Shut up!

45:04.413 --> 45:06.248
-(POPS)
-Ow!

45:06.957 --> 45:09.251
Oh, my eyes. (GROANS)

45:10.460 --> 45:12.129
In here. We're in here.

45:12.754 --> 45:15.048
NEAL: Right there.
PETER: Handcuff her.

45:15.132 --> 45:18.177
-Somebody read her her rights.
-OFFICER: Yes, sir.

45:18.260 --> 45:20.387
-Nice job.
-Not so bad yourself.

45:26.101 --> 45:29.605
Mr. Walker, this just arrived for you.

45:32.691 --> 45:35.110
PETER: It's only fair.
You gave us a heads-up.

45:35.194 --> 45:36.570
I'm returning the favor.

45:36.653 --> 45:38.197
Well, this is only going
to help my lawsuit.

45:38.280 --> 45:40.032
Mmm. There won't be any lawsuit.

45:40.115 --> 45:43.619
-And why is that?
-Your inside woman. Renee talked.

45:43.702 --> 45:46.830
Why settle for 25-to-life tomorrow
when you can plea-bargain today?

45:46.914 --> 45:49.458
Oh, next time, don't get caught.

45:52.961 --> 45:56.298
Whitney, call Arthur. Call the legal team.

46:02.513 --> 46:03.931
PETER: Neal?

46:12.606 --> 46:13.732
You ready?

46:17.152 --> 46:20.197
I am now. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

46:21.782 --> 46:22.991
(SIGHS)

46:28.872 --> 46:31.458
MOZZIE: I saw a mockingbird in the park.

46:31.542 --> 46:33.877
Then you say,
"What color is the mockingbird?"

46:33.961 --> 46:37.339
I'm doing the newspaper thing.
I'm not doing the stupid bird thing.

46:37.422 --> 46:40.634
-How's he holding up?
-Better.

46:40.717 --> 46:43.303
I'm seeing the old Caffrey coming back.

46:43.387 --> 46:44.888
Good.

46:44.972 --> 46:48.350
Whatever part you played in it,
you did good.

46:49.810 --> 46:53.272
I'm sure you didn't call me down here
to tell me how great I did.

46:53.355 --> 46:55.107
-Good. You did good.
-Great. Great.

46:55.190 --> 46:59.444
Look, I know he won't tell me everything.
I get that, he's Neal.

46:59.528 --> 47:02.447
I'll keep an eye on him and you.

47:02.531 --> 47:06.743
But that puts me in a position
to clean up a mess,

47:06.827 --> 47:09.121
not stop it before it happens.

47:09.204 --> 47:11.957
Oh, that's the part
you want me to take care of.

47:12.040 --> 47:14.585
Just tell me if he's gonna do
anything stupid.

47:14.668 --> 47:17.212
-I can't rat out my friend.
-It's to protect him.

47:17.296 --> 47:20.883
That's the same rationale
that was used by the Gestapo and the KGB.

47:20.966 --> 47:22.926
Look at me.

47:23.010 --> 47:24.428
He's my friend too.

47:26.180 --> 47:29.474
-I'll take that under advisement.
-Yeah.

47:34.271 --> 47:36.607
(KNOCKING, DOOR OPENS)

47:36.690 --> 47:39.067
-Mozz.
-We gotta talk, <i>mon frère.</i>

47:39.151 --> 47:40.319
-What's up?
-It's about the box.

47:40.402 --> 47:42.112
Something strange
is going on with the music box.

47:42.196 --> 47:43.488
The trail starts here.

47:43.572 --> 47:47.868
It was bagged after Forensics held it
for two hours in your New York office.

47:47.951 --> 47:50.954
Then OPR requested
it be transferred to DC.

47:51.038 --> 47:52.414
I knew they wouldn't let it sit still.

47:52.497 --> 47:56.502
Somewhere between here and there,
this happened.

47:56.585 --> 47:59.379
That's not the box. I mean,
it's got a similar shape and coloring.

47:59.463 --> 48:02.132
-It was swapped.
-And the real box is in the wind.

48:02.216 --> 48:04.760
Though we cannot change
the direction of the wind,

48:04.843 --> 48:06.094
we may adjust our sails.

48:06.178 --> 48:10.015
Well, the question is,
which way are we headed?

48:13.018 --> 48:14.269
(LINE RINGING)

48:14.353 --> 48:15.687
-DIANA: (ON PHONE) <i>Yeah?</i>
-Diana.

48:15.771 --> 48:19.358
<i>You ready for Fowler's mystery meeting?</i>
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

48:20.734 --> 48:23.195
-I'm right behind you, boss.
-(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
