Lauren, can't this wait?
I have to finish the inventory.

00:03.753 --> 00:05.880
We are missing, like,
five cans of coffee.

00:05.964 --> 00:07.257
They're not at my apartment.

00:07.340 --> 00:08.967
Okay, Gary and I
wanna show you

00:09.050 --> 00:11.094
the window display
we came up with.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.929
Now, look at him.
He doesn't move.

00:13.012 --> 00:16.056
He's like those guards
at Buckingham Palace.

00:16.140 --> 00:17.934
And here's our gimmick,
if you make him laugh

00:18.017 --> 00:19.185
you get a free cupcake.

00:22.147 --> 00:25.150
Gary, a chicken and a monkey
walk into a bar.

00:25.233 --> 00:26.526
[laughing]

00:28.319 --> 00:30.989
Good work.
We'll be bankrupt by noon.

00:31.072 --> 00:32.490
I'm sorry,
but chickens and monkeys

00:32.573 --> 00:34.743
just don't go into bars.

00:34.826 --> 00:36.286
(Valerie)
'Look, guys.'

00:36.369 --> 00:40.457
I appreciate all of your work
and all your creative ideas.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.542
Really, I do, but, uh, listen.

00:42.625 --> 00:46.296
From now on, let's just
try to do things my way, okay?

00:46.379 --> 00:48.923
Let's try that, just my way
and no one else's way, okay?

00:49.007 --> 00:51.384
[chuckles]
Okay!

00:51.468 --> 00:53.845
Or how about we continue doing
whatever the hell we want?

00:53.928 --> 00:54.971
Okay? Okay!

[imitates Valerie]

00:57.724 --> 00:59.517
Okay, listen, I need your help.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.644
Ben called,
and he wants to meet me here.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.355
Oh, my God, your first big
meeting since the breakup.

01:04.438 --> 01:06.941
Well, that's not enough notice.
I need to lose 10 pounds and..

01:07.025 --> 01:09.527
Oh, it's your breakup.
It's not mine.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.155
What are you two talkin' about?

01:12.238 --> 01:14.115
And why do you wanna talk
to Ben about your breakup?

01:14.199 --> 01:15.408
You broke up, it's broke.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.327
Gary, it's the post-breakup
talk.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.245
I mean, I had feelings
for another guy.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.915
I have to let him scream at me
and yell, so we can get past it

01:21.998 --> 01:24.959
and become awkward
and uncomfortable friends.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.170
Who in the hell wants
to be friends with their ex?

01:27.253 --> 01:28.963
That's why they call them exes.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.758
You "ex" 'em out,
"ex" 'em all out.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.928
Mm-hmm, or sometimes
you stalk them

01:35.011 --> 01:37.055
and show up at their wedding.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.143
Hello, Holly.

01:42.227 --> 01:43.937
Oh, hello, Ben.

01:44.020 --> 01:47.732
God. You look good.
You haven't changed a bit.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.734
Holly, we broke up
two days ago.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.945
Oh, God.
You're counting the days?

01:53.196 --> 01:57.033
So, okay, go ahead.
I'm ready. Let me have it.

01:57.116 --> 02:00.537

- It's good to see you.

Hey, so I, uh, brought you
a stale cupcake.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.628
It was the closest thing
they had to a scone.

02:50.712 --> 02:54.424
You know, comfort food
from your native country.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.259
Holly, scones are the reason
that I left England.

02:56.342 --> 02:59.262
No, I was the reason
why you left England.

Holly, the-the reason
I called

03:04.684 --> 03:05.852
was to go over
my song list for Skids--

03:05.935 --> 03:08.146
I know, I'm sorry, I didn't..

03:08.229 --> 03:09.522
What?

03:09.606 --> 03:11.190
Yeah, I was thinking
of opening with, uh

03:11.274 --> 03:12.275

03:12.358 --> 03:13.860
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Look.

03:13.943 --> 03:17.697
We broke up because I still
had feelings for Vince.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.991
That's had to have
made you a little pissy.

03:20.074 --> 03:22.410
Well, yeah, I mean, I'm sad
that we're not together

03:22.493 --> 03:23.786
but, you know, it's done.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.163

this is a little sconey.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.210

about the damn pastry?

rub that in my face

your MP3 player?

03:41.721 --> 03:43.932

Listen, Holly,
I'm really okay with everything.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.311
Maybe I should go and work
on my song list by myself.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.563
I'll catch up with you later.

you have to be mean.

- Why not?

trust me to run this place.

that you should hear them.

This is great.

So, do you wanna
hear the song?

09:56.554 --> 09:58.889
Oh, you kidding me?
I would love to.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.183
Oh, Ben, I am so excited.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.185
I feel like this
is a really good starting point

10:03.269 --> 10:05.021

You know what?
I think we all get the point.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.779
You were so right. Opening up,
letting my feelings out..

10:54.862 --> 10:56.030
It makes me feel so much better.

10:56.113 --> 10:57.823
In fact,
I like this song so much

10:57.907 --> 10:59.408
I'm gonna play it
at Skids tonight.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.119
Uh, no, I don't think so.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.829
What? I don't think so what?

11:03.913 --> 11:06.415
You are not playing that song
tonight at Skids.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.584
[laughing]
Oh, I think I am.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.753
I-I think it sucks,
and I'm your manager.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.421
Oh, well, I think
that maybe, you think it sucks

11:12.505 --> 11:14.006
because you can't
take the truth.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.967
The truth? Are you kidding me?
That song was all lies.

11:17.051 --> 11:20.096
Um.. Yes, that's exactly
what happened! Lies!

11:20.179 --> 11:23.015
Oh, Okay, well,
I never lied to you on purpose.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.768
Oh, I'm sorry, but nothing
rhymes with "On purpose."

11:27.103 --> 11:29.271
You know what,
that producer from AMI Records

11:29.355 --> 11:30.940
is gonna be there,
and what if he likes it

11:31.023 --> 11:32.650
and then buys it
and records it?

11:32.733 --> 11:34.944
It'll play all over
the internet and the radio.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.571
And even people in China
will think Holly Tyler

11:37.655 --> 11:40.199
is a lie, lie,
lie, lie, lie, lie, lie!

11:40.282 --> 11:42.034
Okay, okay, I get it.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.536
I've got news for you,
Holly Tyler.

11:43.619 --> 11:45.496
It's my song, and I'll sing it
wherever I want.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.957
If you wanna hear the next three
verses, be at Skids at 8:00.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.960
And you should know, I saved
the really mean stuff for last.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.878
Hey, you know what, Sheffield?

11:52.962 --> 11:54.797
I liked you better
when you were all bottled up.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.298
Huh? How's that for cathartic?

11:56.382 --> 11:58.092
You can't use a word
when you don't even know

11:58.175 --> 11:59.593
what it means!

11:59.677 --> 12:02.805
I know what
"get out" means, so get out!

12:08.102 --> 12:11.355
Cathartic.
With a "K" or a "C"?

12:14.859 --> 12:16.277
[instrumental music]

12:17.736 --> 12:20.823
It was horrible.
Look, I-I'm still shaking.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.535
I pooped my pants.

12:26.036 --> 12:28.873
Uh, I mean, he had, at least,
a foot and 200 pounds on me.

12:28.956 --> 12:30.332
But I made him cry.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.627
I bit him in the ear.
Yeah, I totally Tysoned him.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.797
You guys shouldn't
have tried to fight him.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.257
They say you're not
supposed to do that.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.842
I know, but I was in charge.

12:39.925 --> 12:42.303
Lauren, but you're not supposed
to try to be the hero.

12:42.386 --> 12:46.140
Don't you watch
"CSI" anything?

12:46.223 --> 12:48.100
The important thing
is that you're okay.

12:48.184 --> 12:51.353
- I'm gonna go call the police.
- No, no police!

12:51.437 --> 12:54.482
Um, Val, I mean,
thank God you, you weren't here.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.567
I mean, because I couldn't
have fought off this monster

12:56.650 --> 12:58.402
and protect you
and Lauren at the same time.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.362
Oh, my damn.

13:00.446 --> 13:03.365
Excuse me, uh,
my name is Elizabeth Green.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.242
This is my daughter Karen.

13:05.326 --> 13:08.162
I found the money
she stole from your shop.

13:10.372 --> 13:13.542
This is the one
with the prison tats?

13:13.626 --> 13:16.587
You're off the steroids,
I see.

13:16.670 --> 13:19.298
I am so not
returning those thin mints.

13:19.381 --> 13:20.925
I'm so sorry.

13:21.008 --> 13:23.219
She's really been
acting out since my husband

13:23.302 --> 13:24.512
and I got divorced.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.347
I hope there's some way
we can settle this

13:26.430 --> 13:28.474
without involving the police.

13:28.557 --> 13:29.975
Me too.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.394
Unless, of course,
you guys want to file charges

13:32.478 --> 13:34.480
against the Westside
strangler here.

13:34.563 --> 13:36.232
Are you alright?

13:36.315 --> 13:39.652
She said you went down pretty
hard when she kicked you.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.820
Oh, there's gonna be a bruise.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.074
What do you say, Karen?

13:45.157 --> 13:47.660
You're lucky
I wasn't wearing clogs.

13:47.743 --> 13:51.872
- 'Karen!'
- Let's just let this go, okay?

13:51.956 --> 13:53.165
This ain't over.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.543
Oh, we're gonna dance again,
little scout.

13:58.295 --> 13:59.421
Thank you so much.

13:59.505 --> 14:03.259
Listen, I'm really sorry, lady.

14:03.342 --> 14:06.720
Hey, hey, it's okay.
Come here.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.599
Let's go, Karen.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.602
Now, where did you
steal the laptop from?

14:15.396 --> 14:18.857
Okay, I'm gonna try to control
myself before I scream.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.651
Can't do it!

14:20.734 --> 14:21.944
I trusted you.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.113
You were robbed
by a ten-year-old?

14:24.196 --> 14:26.115
She was 14 if she was a day!

14:26.198 --> 14:28.033
This is why I can't
trust you, Lauren.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.368
Or you, for that matter.

14:29.451 --> 14:30.786
This never would've happened
if I was here.

14:30.869 --> 14:32.162
But she wanted me
to buy some cookies

14:32.246 --> 14:33.414
so she wouldn't get
kicked out of her troop.

14:33.497 --> 14:34.915
I don't wanna hear it.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.084
Just go in the back and get
your stuff and get out, alright?

14:37.167 --> 14:38.502
I will lock up,
I will clean the mixers

14:38.586 --> 14:39.753
I'll make the deposits.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.630
I will do everything
because I'm the only one

14:41.714 --> 14:43.632
who can do anything around here!

14:43.716 --> 14:45.551
I can't believe you went
and got her some water.

14:45.634 --> 14:46.969
Oh, shut up,
or I'll have my niece

14:47.052 --> 14:48.971
come over and take you down!

14:50.139 --> 14:53.183
- I am so angry!
- 'You're angry?'

14:53.267 --> 14:55.352
[both ranting]

15:01.567 --> 15:02.568
(both)
What?

15:02.651 --> 15:05.362
[indistinct chatter]

15:05.446 --> 15:07.781
Hey, okay. You first.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.158
- Ben wrote a song about you?
- Yes.

15:09.241 --> 15:10.701
And he thinks
that he's actually

15:10.784 --> 15:12.870
playing it tonight
at Skids at 8 o'clock

15:12.953 --> 15:14.788
but I rearranged his schedule

15:14.872 --> 15:18.125
so he is playing it
at 2 a.m. Ha-ha-ha!

15:18.208 --> 15:20.169
That's a little harsh,
don't you think?

15:20.252 --> 15:22.588
Are you actually
taking his side?

15:24.131 --> 15:27.092
He wrote horrible things
about me.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.970
Well, you're the one
who was begging him to open up

15:30.054 --> 15:31.764
express his feelings.

15:31.847 --> 15:33.015
What did you expect?

15:33.098 --> 15:34.683
Well, I was expecting
for him to be mad

15:34.767 --> 15:39.146
but when he sang that song,
the words and his face..

15:39.229 --> 15:40.898
I didn't realize
how much I hurt him.

15:40.981 --> 15:44.193
Oh, my God,
I was so horrible to him.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.527
I wouldn't blame him
if he didn't want

15:45.611 --> 15:46.862
to be my friend.

15:46.945 --> 15:48.781
Oh, sweetie.

15:48.864 --> 15:49.907
You didn't mean to hurt him.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.368
I know, but I still hurt him.

15:52.451 --> 15:55.037
Well, if singing
that song is somehow--

15:55.120 --> 15:56.497
- Cathartic?
- What?

15:56.580 --> 16:00.959
You know, "emotionally purging,"
synonym, "purifying?"

16:01.043 --> 16:04.588
Well, I am gonna miss Ben's
influence on your vocabulary.

16:05.881 --> 16:08.425
I should let him sing the song,
shouldn't I?

16:08.509 --> 16:10.302
Just like you should
let Gary and Lauren--

16:10.386 --> 16:12.221
Oh, no, no, uh-uh.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.931
I'm too old to change.

16:14.014 --> 16:17.142
There's still time
for you, young 'un. Go on.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.812
Thank you.

16:21.855 --> 16:24.024
- Val..
- Oh.

16:24.108 --> 16:27.027
Hey. You guys need
someone to walk you home?

16:27.111 --> 16:30.781
You're gonna have to walk
by that scary pre-school.

16:30.864 --> 16:33.075
Okay, Val,
I know that you're mad

16:33.158 --> 16:35.160
but it doesn't mean
you can't trust me.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.662
Anyone can be robbed.

16:36.745 --> 16:38.789
No, not me. I would've been
paying attention.

16:38.872 --> 16:42.251
I wouldn't have been taken
by some sweet-faced little girl.

16:42.334 --> 16:45.671
Hi. We're back.

16:45.754 --> 16:48.799
And Karen has something
to give you.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.553
My wallet?

16:54.304 --> 16:57.599
It's not real Chanel.
That's why I'm giving it back.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.436
- 'Karen!'
- I'm sorry.

17:00.519 --> 17:03.272
The divorce has really been
messing with my head.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.107
But again, thanks for no cops.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.776
We won't be
bothering you anymore.

17:07.859 --> 17:10.695
Listen, I'm real sorry, lady.

17:10.779 --> 17:12.656
Aah! Karen!

17:16.660 --> 17:18.871
Huh. Oh, my God.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.080
Fake Chanel?

17:21.165 --> 17:22.750
You know, Val,
if you were paying attention

17:22.833 --> 17:24.334
maybe, you would've seen her
take your wallet.

17:24.417 --> 17:26.462
Mm-hmm, how are we gonna
trust you to run this place

17:26.545 --> 17:28.005
when we're not here?

17:28.088 --> 17:31.008
Look, I knew
she took the wallet.

17:31.091 --> 17:33.761
I was just trying to teach..

17:33.844 --> 17:35.971
...me a lesson.

17:36.054 --> 17:37.723
Man, that kid must
sandpaper her fingertips.

17:37.806 --> 17:39.391
I didn't feel a thing.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.935
Look, alright, I'm sorry.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.604
'It could've
happened to anybody.'

17:43.687 --> 17:46.857
And I am gonna start
trusting you more, alright?

17:46.940 --> 17:51.153
And to show my trust,
I am gonna come in ten minutes

17:51.236 --> 17:53.572
after we open tomorrow. Ha ha!

17:54.573 --> 17:55.991
Oh, it's not good enough.

17:56.074 --> 17:58.952
No. You need to go home
and trust us to close up.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.413
Deposit, lights,
lock up, everything.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.207
I was thinking more
like early Christmas bonuses?

18:03.290 --> 18:04.500
- Oh, that's better.
- That's better.

18:04.583 --> 18:05.751
I don't want
any more responsibility..

18:05.834 --> 18:06.919
I can come in late,
go home early.

18:07.002 --> 18:08.003
Get a good night's sleep..

18:08.086 --> 18:09.922
[indistinct chatter]

18:12.382 --> 18:14.676
[rock music]

18:21.475 --> 18:22.643
[applause]

18:25.270 --> 18:28.023
If you came to see me perform,
you're a tad early.

18:28.106 --> 18:29.733
Apparently, my manager
called and had my slot

18:29.817 --> 18:31.109
switched to 2 a.m.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.987
Yeah, well, your manager
was a little bitter earlier.

18:34.071 --> 18:35.948
But she called back.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.116
You're going on next.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.535
You did that?

18:39.618 --> 18:42.371
And I was thinking
about it and it's okay

18:42.454 --> 18:44.206
if you play
the "I Hate Holly" song.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.708
Actually, it's called
"Holly Tyler Sucks."

18:46.792 --> 18:48.585
Well, the point is,
you deserve to get

18:48.669 --> 18:50.921
through this
any way that you want.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.130
Thanks.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.049
And you know what else
I was thinking about?

18:54.132 --> 18:57.427
Throughout this whole thing,
I never said I was sorry.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.680
No, you didn't.

18:59.763 --> 19:02.432
Ben...listen

19:02.516 --> 19:03.475
I am so sorry.

19:03.559 --> 19:06.103
Now, Holly, Holly, it's okay.

19:06.186 --> 19:09.565
I know you didn't
do anything on purpose.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.817
You can't help
who you fall in love with.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.866
(male announcer)
'Coming up next,
Ben Sheffield!'

19:18.949 --> 19:20.492
Oh, go up there.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.619
Be all salutary.

19:22.703 --> 19:25.205
You know, "therapeutic."

19:27.624 --> 19:30.335
I hate to admit it,
