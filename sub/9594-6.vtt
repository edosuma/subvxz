00:29.830 --> 00:32.100
TITANS: Surprise!

00:32.200 --> 00:33.534
BIRDARANG:
A surprise party?

00:33.634 --> 00:37.071
Oh, happiest day of the birth,
beatboxing Birdarang!

00:37.171 --> 00:39.573
-Oh, dang! Dave!

00:39.673 --> 00:40.374
Super Robin!

00:40.474 --> 00:42.110
-Pain Bot.
-PAIN BOT: Pain.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.512
The whole gang is here.
You Titans are tops!

00:44.612 --> 00:49.083
You guys are all part
of the Titan family,
and we are so proud.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.318
You know it.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.052
-We all...
-ROBIN: Titans, listen up!

00:52.153 --> 00:54.522
I've prepared some longwinded
remarks for the occasion.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.490
It all began on that...

00:56.590 --> 00:58.592
-Thanks, Dave.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.094
ROBIN:
Down, Dave!

01:00.194 --> 01:02.096
I don't know what to say,
except...

01:02.196 --> 01:04.465
-Give me a beat!

01:10.871 --> 01:12.206
Pain. Pain.

01:14.408 --> 01:17.845
You are quite the dancer,
Super Robin.

01:17.945 --> 01:21.449
"Quite the dancer."
I can't believe she's fallen
for those lame moves.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.720
Crime alert in Jump City!
We'd better check it out!

01:26.820 --> 01:28.289
Titans, go!

01:28.389 --> 01:30.624
We'll be right back.
We need more ice anyway!

01:30.724 --> 01:32.626
Keep this party going!

01:32.726 --> 01:34.228
Roger that.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.407
This partay won't ever stop.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.190
You won't keep us
in here forever.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.657
THE BRAIN:
I won't have to.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.327
These last eight months
have been very productive.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.662
My project is nearly complete.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.798
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.267
Hey, Brian, we gonna eat soon?

02:13.367 --> 02:15.536
Brian

02:15.636 --> 02:17.171
You! You're Brian.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.273
No, my name is The Brain.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.275
The "A" is before the "I".

02:21.375 --> 02:23.411
What is this?
Reading school?

02:23.511 --> 02:25.179
Argh!

02:25.813 --> 02:26.914
Don't worry, Titans.

02:27.014 --> 02:29.350
I have the perfect
escape plan.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.419
Dude, will you give it up?

02:31.519 --> 02:33.421
You've been trying to escape
for eight months now.

02:33.521 --> 02:37.625
And every time it fails,
he gives us... the torture.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.795
What can we do, Robin?
He took away our powers.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.531
But, he didn't get mine.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.633
Because my powers are up here.

02:45.733 --> 02:46.634
And in here.

02:47.435 --> 02:49.303
And mostly... here.

02:51.439 --> 02:54.375
Face it, if we're going
to escape, it's all up to us.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.844
Now listen, here's the plan.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.279
Beast Boy creates a diversion.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.913
The Brain comes in
to check it out.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.217
I get the drop on him
and take him down.
It can't miss.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.852
Are you crazy, man?

03:04.952 --> 03:06.220
That'll never work.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.722
Please, do not make the
Beast Boy do it.

03:08.822 --> 03:12.326
Do it!
And don't deviate
from the plan!

03:13.327 --> 03:15.363
Ah, fine.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.269
Help! Help!

03:21.369 --> 03:24.638
I need a doctor!

03:29.009 --> 03:31.879
Just like I planned.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.647
THE BRAIN:
Trying to escape again?

03:33.747 --> 03:35.883
Perhaps this will
teach you a lesson.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.351
No! No!

03:37.451 --> 03:39.620
Robin made me!
Teach him a lesson!

03:39.720 --> 03:42.856
He's the one
who needs teaching!

03:54.502 --> 03:56.770
Titans, I have a new plan.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.524
BIRDARANG:
What's crackalackin, yo?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.593
A distress beacon?

04:19.693 --> 04:22.396
Oh, snap, I thought
it was a party light.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.401
A suicide mission
to rescue the other Titans?

04:27.501 --> 04:29.303
I'm down,
who else is in?

04:32.139 --> 04:33.707
Pain.

04:33.807 --> 04:34.775
That's what's up.

04:44.418 --> 04:45.786
BIRDARANG:
Boom!

05:09.443 --> 05:10.778
BIRDARANG:
My bad.

05:18.686 --> 05:21.689
BIRDARANG: Oh, man!
That move was off the hook!

05:23.023 --> 05:25.426
Dang, yo!

05:29.062 --> 05:30.698
That's a party foul.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.367
Got it.

05:33.467 --> 05:36.103
Now, if I can just reach
the shut-off switch.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.372
Can you reach your
shut

05:38.472 --> 05:39.540
You can't escape.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.974
Nobody's coming for us.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.810
Fine with me.
I'm happy here.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.813
Got my bucket,
and three meals a day.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.014
It is nice and quiet.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.350
And tomorrow is the
night of the grilled cheese.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.420
You'll thank me in a minute.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.689
This really hurts!

05:55.789 --> 05:57.425
Hey, hey, hey, keep it down!

05:59.593 --> 06:02.763
Bro, do us a solid,
and scream a little quieter.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.432
Please!

06:04.532 --> 06:06.634
This is the worst pain
I've ever experienced!

06:06.734 --> 06:10.471
You are risking the night
of the grilled cheese!

06:10.571 --> 06:12.473
THE BRAIN:
Another escape attempt?

06:20.047 --> 06:21.849
Peep this.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.651
Now is not the time
to feel like a bunch of
sad sacks, fellas.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.453
The Titans have been
so good to us.

06:25.553 --> 06:26.887
And now they need our help.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.690
Pain Bot, remember how
you felt before you met them?

06:29.790 --> 06:30.558
Pain.

06:31.258 --> 06:32.426
Word.
And how do you feel now?

06:32.526 --> 06:33.494
Pain.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.062
-Word!

06:35.162 --> 06:37.665
Word!
Word to your whole family.

06:37.765 --> 06:38.966
-Dang!

06:42.703 --> 06:44.805
-That was off the chain!

07:04.758 --> 07:07.427
Now, that's what I call
a distraction.

07:11.565 --> 07:12.600
The perfect escape.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.102
One man.
One spoon.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.436
Whatevs, dude.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.738
I ain't digging nothing.

07:17.838 --> 07:20.574
Brian said if we're good,
he'll let us have a TV.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.676
He is evil, but fair.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.045
Hey, hey, hey, wake up!

07:25.145 --> 07:27.815
We have to focus
on the tunnel.
Nobody is coming.

07:27.915 --> 07:30.050
-BIRDARANG: Hiya, fellas.

07:30.150 --> 07:33.053
We thought we'd throw you
a surprise rescue party.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.988
Guys! Guys! The tunnel!

07:35.088 --> 07:36.724
No one is coming for us!

07:36.824 --> 07:38.859
Look who has
come for us, Robin.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.561
Dig!

07:43.296 --> 07:45.132
I can't believe you found us.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.868
THE BRAIN: They have come
on a fool's errand.

07:58.211 --> 08:01.982
Fueled by your super powers,
behold Project Brain!

08:02.082 --> 08:06.486
"Brain's Robotic
Indestructible Armor Nexus."

08:06.587 --> 08:08.488
BEAST BOY:
That's Project Brian, dude.

08:08.589 --> 08:11.625
No, "Brain." B-R-I...

08:13.927 --> 08:16.864
Kilowatts, how could I
make that mistake?

08:18.899 --> 08:19.900
-Fellas, bust a move.

08:49.730 --> 08:53.834
No!

09:02.676 --> 09:04.244
Don't go, bro!

09:05.679 --> 09:07.781
Don't go, bro!

09:11.885 --> 09:13.754
Now, I will finish you all.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.823
Let's dance, Brian.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.136
Ahh!

10:45.813 --> 10:48.716
Focus, Titans.
The tunnel's our only hope!
