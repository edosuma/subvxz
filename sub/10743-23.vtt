00:19.053 --> 00:20.552
 Good morning,
 Major Healey.

00:20.554 --> 00:21.987
             Hi, Jeannie.
          Uh, where's Tony?

00:21.989 --> 00:23.088
                He asked me
              to pick him up.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.356
    Oh, he overslept.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.525
Would you like a cup of coffee
while you're waiting?

00:26.527 --> 00:27.526
                     No,
             I'm in a hurry. I--

00:27.528 --> 00:28.593
         Why?

00:28.595 --> 00:30.162
                Well, Friday is
              General Peterson's

00:30.164 --> 00:31.530
              10th anniversary
                as a general,

00:31.532 --> 00:33.732
      and, uh, well, Dr. Bellows
      wants to put on this show.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.501
     And I have to find somebody
            to take charge

00:35.503 --> 00:36.968
            of the entertainment
                 committee.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.438
Oh, Major Nelson is very good
at being in charge of things.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.805
                 Well, it's not
               a matter of that.

00:40.807 --> 00:42.908
         You gotta know somebody
        that's in show business.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.743
         You gotta have somebody
           that has a big act.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.811
         He doesn't know anybody
        in show business at all.

00:46.813 --> 00:48.446
      I will help him.

00:48.448 --> 00:50.114
              Well, you co-- No.
                Oh, no. Oh, no.

00:50.116 --> 00:52.016
He doesn't like you helping him.
          Don't do it.

00:52.018 --> 00:54.018
How would it look
if some other master's genie

00:54.020 --> 00:55.053
was in charge?

00:56.123 --> 00:57.255
                    Yeah, I see
                  what you mean.

00:57.257 --> 00:58.924
                   No! No, no.
                 Oh, no. Oh, no.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.992
He would enjoy himself.
            Forget-- Not me. No.

01:00.994 --> 01:03.294
He may not think so, but he
would enjoy himself a great--

01:03.296 --> 01:04.495
                    That's out.
     Major Healey,

01:04.498 --> 01:07.031
   if Major Nelson is not
       put in charge,

01:07.033 --> 01:08.734
     I can promise you
     that on the night

01:08.736 --> 01:10.268
of General Peterson's party,

01:10.270 --> 01:13.338
       there will be
   a terrible hurricane.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.039
             [♪♪♪]

01:15.041 --> 01:16.040
         The night of the party?

01:17.378 --> 01:19.044
       And a tidal wave.

01:19.046 --> 01:21.246
       General Peterson's party?

01:22.416 --> 01:23.881
         And a typhoon.

01:23.883 --> 01:26.884
 And we'll all be sitting around
        having cocktails?

01:28.021 --> 01:30.956
              Hm. Well, I guess
            that's it. Ha-ha-ha.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.957
   I guess we found the new head
         of our committee.

01:32.959 --> 01:34.893
          [LAUGHS]

01:36.329 --> 01:38.397
       Oh. And, shh,
not a word to Major Nelson.

01:38.399 --> 01:39.664
               Yeah, not a word.
                      Shh.

01:39.666 --> 01:40.766
               Yeah, not a word.
                    Oh, boy.

01:40.768 --> 01:41.900
                 Guess I'll be--

01:41.902 --> 01:45.337
Oh, hi, Roge.
I'm sorry. I overslept.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.338
     Do you know something?

01:46.340 --> 01:47.339
                      Huh, what?

01:47.341 --> 01:48.607
      You should've stayed
            in bed.

             [♪♪♪]

03:21.201 --> 03:22.534
          Frankly, Major Healey,

03:22.536 --> 03:24.736
      I would never have thought
       of Major Nelson for this.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.404
    Ah, well, frankly,
   neither did I, sir.

03:26.406 --> 03:27.906
   It just came to me
    out of the blue.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.408
  Do you think he can get a top
 entertainer for Friday evening?

03:30.410 --> 03:32.277
   Well, if he can't,
he knows someone who can.

03:32.279 --> 03:34.880
Uh, he's really quite anxious
to head the committee, though.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.982
      Oh, strange. He never said
        a word to me about it.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.516
    Well, you know
  how modest Tony is.

03:38.518 --> 03:40.118
    But he'll come up
   with someone great.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.087
               Ah, Major Nelson.
  Yes.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.789
          I just want to express
             my appreciation.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.256
Your appreciation, sir?

03:45.258 --> 03:47.859
For volunteering to take charge
  of General Peterson's party.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.561
     I haven't had a chance
       to tell you that--

03:49.563 --> 03:51.029
For volunteering
to take--?

03:51.031 --> 03:53.598
      Uh, Major Healey told me
   how anxious you are to do it.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.367
Oh, Major Healey
told you that,
did he? Thanks.

03:56.369 --> 03:57.969
       We were considering using

03:57.971 --> 03:59.705
   some of the amateur talent
          around here,

03:59.707 --> 04:01.807
but with all the people
in show business you know,

04:01.809 --> 04:03.274
that won't be necessary,
        will it?

04:03.276 --> 04:04.509
          People in show
           business I--

04:04.511 --> 04:06.211
                I told you he's
               modest. Ha-ha-ha.

04:06.213 --> 04:08.479
I don't know one single person
in the entertainment--

04:08.481 --> 04:10.281
             That's right.
       Most of them are married.

04:10.283 --> 04:13.418
 Well, it's in your hands now,
         Major Nelson.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.420
This is one of the most
important evenings

04:15.422 --> 04:17.389

04:32.205 --> 04:33.739

   Well, if you're not the head
  of the entertainment committee

04:36.309 --> 04:38.577
during General Peterson's party,
      there's going to be

04:38.579 --> 04:42.113
       a hurricane, a tidal wave
             and a typhoon.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.382

   Jeannie did that?

04:43.384 --> 04:44.383
               Not so loud.
                   Shh.

                   her mad, now.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.051

make you do that? Why?

 How would it look if some other
   genie's master got the job?

04:49.456 --> 04:51.656
      I mean, all you have to do
     is get a great entertainer.

04:51.658 --> 04:52.957
        Oh, sure.
   I don't know anybody

04:52.959 --> 04:54.760

       I just told--

04:54.762 --> 04:55.960
         Yeah, but Jeannie does.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.929
Yeah, I'm sure she does.
I can just see her now.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.598
Uh, uh, Shakespeare
will come out

04:59.600 --> 05:01.065
and introduce
Sarah Bernhardt,

05:01.067 --> 05:03.034
and then Ben Hur will do
a little chariot race.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.202
               Yeah, yeah.
              Wait a minute.

05:04.204 --> 05:06.671
            Then after Ben Hur,
          maybe some gladiators.

05:06.673 --> 05:08.273
              Wait a minute,
         you have the first act.

05:08.275 --> 05:09.675
                    Oh.
    You got the whole first act.

05:09.677 --> 05:10.942
             Now,
     I can't be the head

05:10.944 --> 05:12.410
     of the entertainment
          committee.

05:12.412 --> 05:14.145
            Why not?
Yeah, why not?

05:14.147 --> 05:16.347
I bet Jeannie knows a lot
of people in show business.

05:16.349 --> 05:17.348
                       Oh, yeah.
             Of course.

              thousands.

     me for-- For-- For this.

              for entertainment?

05:26.593 --> 05:27.592

                     Yeah, that.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.396
     Well, we could start
with a chariot race by Ben Hur

05:32.398 --> 05:33.498
     and then some gladiators.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.199

running along.

    turned out to be. I really--

            do this to me?

    you might like
