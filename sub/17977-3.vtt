10:34.767 --> 10:37.133
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE, LIKE,
MAYBE SPIN IT.

10:37.167 --> 10:38.734
TRY SPINNING IT.

10:38.767 --> 10:40.834

10:40.868 --> 10:42.901
OH, MY GOD, THAT'S YUMMY,

10:42.933 --> 10:45.000
BUT I THINK YOU CAN
BE EVEN BOLDER

10:45.033 --> 10:46.100
WITH THE GINGER.

10:46.133 --> 10:48.901
BE BOLD WITH THE GINGER, YEAH.

10:48.933 --> 10:49.968
WHAT'S THIS?

10:50.000 --> 10:50.968
JAMBON OR PROSCIUTTO?

10:51.033 --> 10:51.968
NO, IT'S SPECK.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.133
IT'S A SALT

10:53.167 --> 10:54.299
FROM THE NORTH OF ITALY.

10:54.334 --> 10:55.399

SPINNING IT NOW.

10:55.433 --> 10:58.399
WHAT THE FUCK...

10:58.433 --> 10:59.299
BRAVISSIMA,
CARA MIA.

10:59.334 --> 11:00.000
HEY, LISTEN,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.900
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
DOING ANY VEGAN SELECTIONS?

11:02.934 --> 11:04.434
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, CAN
YOU DO ANYTHING FABULOUS

11:04.466 --> 11:06.734
WITH SEITAN
OR TEMPEH?

11:06.767 --> 11:09.099
BILLIE,
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

11:09.132 --> 11:10.634
I WAS GOING OVER
THE NEW MENU WITH LARA,

11:10.666 --> 11:11.900
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

11:11.933 --> 11:14.300
A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITY
ARE VEGETARIANS,

11:14.333 --> 11:15.766
A LOT ARE VEGAN,

11:15.801 --> 11:17.132
AND GOD FORBID
WE SHOULD FORGET

11:17.167 --> 11:19.833
THOSE LACTOSE-INTOLERANT
LESBIANS.

11:19.867 --> 11:22.100
UH, BILLIE, WE DID NOT
DISCUSS CHANGING THE MENU.

11:22.132 --> 11:23.501
OH, COME ON, KIT,

11:23.533 --> 11:26.100
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH
EVERY SINGLE DETAIL WITH ME.

11:26.132 --> 11:27.100
I DON'T?

11:27.132 --> 11:28.234
NO.

11:28.266 --> 11:29.701
YOU WANT ME TO COME IN HERE,
TAKE CHARGE,

11:29.734 --> 11:31.234
AND FREE THINGS UP FOR YOU.

11:31.266 --> 11:32.600
HEY, DARLING.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

11:32.634 --> 11:34.734
AND THEN YOU CAN GO OFF
AND WRITE YOUR SONGS

11:34.767 --> 11:37.834
AND PERFORM YOUR MUSIC
AND MAKE YOUR RECORD.

11:37.868 --> 11:39.299
I DO?

11:39.334 --> 11:41.767
YES, YOU DO.

11:41.801 --> 11:43.399
YOU KNOW,
YOU JUST HAVE TO TRUST

11:43.433 --> 11:46.133
THAT BILLIE BLAIKIE
KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

11:46.167 --> 11:47.533
IT'S FUCKING
FREEZING IN HERE.

11:47.567 --> 11:48.533
OH-- DON'T YOU...

11:48.567 --> 11:49.634
STOP THAT.
DON'T TOUCH--

11:49.667 --> 11:50.767
IT'S BOILING IN HERE.

11:50.801 --> 11:52.500
I'M SO HOT.

11:52.533 --> 11:54.500
CHECK OUT THESE THINGS.

11:54.533 --> 11:55.701
ANYBODY IN HERE HOT?

11:55.734 --> 11:57.267
[EVERYBODY]: NO.

11:57.299 --> 11:58.267
ANYBODY COLD?

11:58.299 --> 11:59.299
[EVERYBODY]: YES!

11:59.334 --> 12:02.500
DEMOCRACY AT WORK.

12:02.533 --> 12:03.968
THE OTHER THING I WAS
THINKING ABOUT, KIT DARLIN',

12:04.067 --> 12:05.734
WAS THAT IT WOULD BE REALLY
NICE AND HOSPITABLE

12:05.767 --> 12:08.701
IF WE COULD, LIKE, HOOK UP
ONE OF THOSE VIRTUAL LANs

12:08.734 --> 12:10.067
AND HAVE A COUPLE OF
FREE TERMINALS.

12:10.067 --> 12:11.234
VIRTUAL WHAT?

12:11.266 --> 12:12.300
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
OUR PEOPLE,

12:12.333 --> 12:13.300
THEY'RE KIND OF USED
TO HAVING WIRELESS

12:13.333 --> 12:14.467

12:16.399 --> 12:17.367
WHOSE TRUCK IS THAT?

12:17.399 --> 12:18.367

15:48.968 --> 15:49.600
WHY ARE YOU GOING TO PIECES?

15:49.634 --> 15:51.133
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

15:51.167 --> 15:52.968
THE N.E.A. PULLED THE GRANT
FOR MY SHOW THIS MORNING

15:53.067 --> 15:55.067
BECAUSE WE LIVE IN THE MOST
REPRESSIVE POLITICAL CLIMATE

15:55.067 --> 15:56.100
IN THE LAST 50 YEARS.

15:56.133 --> 15:57.466
OH, THAT'S SO FUCKED UP.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.567
YEAH, AND
THEN SECONDLY,

15:59.600 --> 16:01.066
TINA IS SO
FREAKED OUT ABOUT MONEY

16:01.066 --> 16:02.567
THAT I'M BEGINNING TO THINK

16:02.601 --> 16:05.267
THAT MAYBE I SHOULD CONSIDER
TAKING THAT CITIBANK JOB,

16:05.299 --> 16:07.734
WHICH JUST MAKES ME
WANT TO KILL MYSELF.

16:07.767 --> 16:08.801
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT TAKING A JOB

16:08.833 --> 16:09.900
THAT DOESN'T
MAKE YOUR HEART SING.

16:09.933 --> 16:11.634
TELL IT LIKE IT IS, MANGUS.

16:11.666 --> 16:13.067
AND BEING ANGELICA'S NANNY?

16:13.067 --> 16:15.801
MAKES MY HEART SING, TOTALLY.

16:15.833 --> 16:17.300
YAY!

16:17.333 --> 16:18.300
YAY!

I'M GOING TO HAVE

16:54.366 --> 16:56.133

16:56.167 --> 16:57.634
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE FILM INDUSTRY,

16:57.667 --> 17:00.000
BUT I KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER

17:00.000 --> 17:02.766
SHAOLIN'S ONLY EVER

17:02.801 --> 17:05.868

FOR DEVELOPMENT.

17:16.900 --> 17:18.199
EXACTLY.

17:24.199 --> 17:27.833

17:35.067 --> 17:37.901

YOU HAVE MUCH MORE
EXPERIENCE AT THIS RACKET

17:40.133 --> 17:41.133
THAN I DO,

17:41.167 --> 17:42.868
SO YOU'D PRETTY MUCH
HAVE FREE REIGN

17:42.901 --> 17:44.567
TO DO WHATEVER YOU THINK BEST...

17:44.600 --> 17:47.533

18:01.734 --> 18:02.766
BUT YOU DON'T THINK

18:02.801 --> 18:04.166
HE'S GOING TO EAT
ANYTHING IN THERE, DO YOU?

18:04.200 --> 18:05.200
I HOPE NOT.

18:05.234 --> 18:06.400
HEY.

18:09.500 --> 18:10.833
EXCUSE ME,

18:15.567 --> 18:16.300
DO YOU WANT SOME HELP?

18:20.132 --> 18:22.634

18:22.667 --> 18:24.900

"OUR" BEDROOM.

18:24.934 --> 18:26.300
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.067
WELL, DON'T YOU
WANT TO FIND OUT?

18:28.067 --> 18:29.234
NO, THIS IS
JENNY'S HOUSE.

18:29.266 --> 18:31.367

SOME NOTICE

WHO ARE SICK OF HEARING ME RANT
ABOUT MY EX, DANA,

19:21.199 --> 19:23.766
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW
THIS IS NOT ABOUT HER.

19:23.800 --> 19:28.667
THIS CONTINUUM OF CONNECTEDNESS
IS ABOUT THE CAUSE AND EFFECT

19:28.701 --> 19:31.800
OF ONE PSYCHOTROPIC DRUG
AFTER ANOTHER

19:31.833 --> 19:34.901
TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE
MEDICATING YOUR MEDICATION.

19:34.933 --> 19:37.634
WHY DON'T WE START

19:37.667 --> 19:41.067

[AIR HISSING]

19:50.200 --> 19:51.466
SO THEN I SAID TO MY DOCTOR,

19:51.500 --> 19:54.067
"CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME
SOMETHING STRONG, REALLY STRONG,

19:54.067 --> 19:55.067
"THAT'LL JUST MAKE ME HAPPY?

19:55.100 --> 19:57.500
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?"

19:57.533 --> 20:00.000
SO HE GAVE ME LITHIUM.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.400
SO THIS ONE REALLY JUST MADE ME
HALLUCINATE THAT I WAS HAPPY.

20:04.434 --> 20:06.434

YOUR HAIR?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.734
THEN THE WITHDRAWAL
FROM THOSE TWO DRUGS

20:10.766 --> 20:14.199
GAVE ME A.D.D.

20:14.234 --> 20:15.433
SO I GOT THE A.D.D. DRUG.

20:15.467 --> 20:17.300

WHICH HE HIGHLY RECOMMENDS,

20:28.033 --> 20:32.834
BUT SAID, UNDER RARE CASES,
MAY CAUSE ME TO COMMIT SUICIDE.

20:37.567 --> 20:39.801
SO I WAS A LITTLE SCARED
TO TAKE THOSE,

20:39.834 --> 20:41.234

I WASN'T ON ANYTHING,

20:41.267 --> 20:44.667
WHICH MEANT I ACTUALLY
FELT LIKE HAVING SEX AGAIN...

20:49.634 --> 20:52.234

MADE ME WANT TO KILL MYSELF.

21:11.601 --> 21:17.833

IF YOU COULD TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

27:52.634 --> 27:54.267
WILL YOU CALL ANGUS

27:54.299 --> 27:57.167
AND MAKE SURE HE'S ON HIS WAY?

28:03.834 --> 28:08.801
HELENA PEABODY
OFFERED ME A JOB.

28:08.833 --> 28:11.367
HI...

28:11.400 --> 28:13.567
ARE YOU CONSIDERING IT?

28:15.067 --> 28:16.434
I DON'T KNOW YET.

28:16.466 --> 28:18.067
SOMEBODY IN THIS FAMILY'S
GOT TO MAKE A LIVING.

28:18.067 --> 28:21.734
I HAVE MADE A LIVING
FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS.

28:21.766 --> 28:23.266
I DON'T THINK MY ABILITY
TO MAKE A LIVING

28:23.300 --> 28:24.367
IS REALLY IN QUESTION.

28:24.399 --> 28:25.934
I'M NOT QUESTIONING
YOUR ABILITY.

28:25.968 --> 28:28.968
I'M QUESTIONING YOUR DESIRE.

28:30.466 --> 28:32.167
I THOUGHT YOU HATED
THE MOVIE BUSINESS.

28:32.200 --> 28:34.734
THERE'S A LOT I HATE
ABOUT THE MOVIE BUSINESS.

28:34.767 --> 28:36.299
I DEFINITELY
HAVEN'T SAID YES,

28:36.334 --> 28:40.067
BUT SHE MADE IT
VERY ATTRACTIVE.

28:40.100 --> 28:42.200
SO THEN THERE'S
NO REASON

28:42.234 --> 28:44.567
THAT I SHOULD FEEL THREATENED,
OR...

28:47.067 --> 28:48.634
NO, THERE'S NOTHING
BETWEEN US ANYMORE.

28:48.667 --> 28:49.868
NOTHING AT ALL.

28:52.133 --> 28:53.634
WELL, DID YOU TALK ABOUT MONEY?

28:53.667 --> 28:55.767
NO, NOT YET.

28:55.801 --> 28:58.868
I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW.

28:58.901 --> 29:00.000
I STILL DON'T KNOW
IF I'M OKAY WITH IT. I...

29:00.000 --> 29:03.166
I'M NOT SURE IT'S UP TO YOU.

29:05.067 --> 29:06.634
[ALICE]:
YOU KNOW WHAT,

29:06.666 --> 29:07.700
YOU GUYS,

29:07.734 --> 29:08.868
I TOTALLY THINK
IT'S AN EITHER/OR.

29:08.900 --> 29:10.467
I THINK JENNY CAN
HAVE ME AT THIS PARTY,

29:10.500 --> 29:12.234
OR SHE CAN HAVE
DANA AND LARA.

29:12.266 --> 29:14.333
JENNY'S GIRLFRIEND'S
A HUGE TENNIS FAN.

29:14.367 --> 29:16.333
SHE THINKS DANA'S FANTASTIC.

29:16.367 --> 29:17.734
WELL,
WHOOP-DE-FUCKING-DO.

29:17.766 --> 29:19.634
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

29:19.667 --> 29:20.701
WHY I'M ALWAYS
THE ONE

29:20.734 --> 29:22.501
WHO ALWAYS
HAS TO BEHAVE.

29:24.167 --> 29:25.533
[WHISPERING]:
SHANE.
YEAH.

29:25.567 --> 29:26.533
COME HERE.

29:26.567 --> 29:29.800
OH, MY GOD,
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?

29:29.833 --> 29:32.433
THAT'S NOTHING.
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE.

29:32.466 --> 29:33.433
HEY, AL,
CAN YOU HURRY UP?

29:33.466 --> 29:34.433
WE'RE LATE!

29:34.466 --> 29:36.200
OKAY!

29:36.234 --> 29:37.299
I'M EXCITED WE'RE
GOING TO TILE.

29:37.334 --> 29:38.399
IT WAS WRITTEN UP
LAST WEEK

29:38.433 --> 29:39.933
IN L.A. MAGAZINE.

29:39.968 --> 29:42.667

29:49.100 --> 29:50.200
I'M DONE WITH IT.

29:50.234 --> 29:51.167
I JUST HAVEN'T
GOTTEN AROUND TO IT, OKAY?

29:51.200 --> 29:52.334
YEAH. YEAH,

29:59.500 --> 30:00.000
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
BLOT IT A LITTLE BIT.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.800

DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING?

30:01.834 --> 30:02.900

30:08.000 --> 30:09.766

HOW IS SHE?
SHE SEEMS REALLY GOOD.

30:46.968 --> 30:48.100

30:52.399 --> 30:54.200
WHATEVER. THEY'RE BOTH
IN THE MIDWEST, RIGHT?

30:54.234 --> 30:55.500
BUT SHE'S OKAY?

30:55.533 --> 30:58.133
SHE'S HAPPY, SHE'S NOT...

31:00.000 --> 31:01.500

I THINK SHE'S BEEN
OUT OF THE HOSPITAL, NOW,

31:03.467 --> 31:04.634
FOR FIVE MONTHS.

31:04.666 --> 31:05.666
SHE SEEMS TO BE DOING
REALLY WELL.

31:05.700 --> 31:06.700
OH, GOOD.

31:06.734 --> 31:08.400
I HAD A COUSIN

32:06.700 --> 32:09.234

ALTHOUGH I'M SURE
IT DOESN'T COMPARE

32:57.334 --> 32:58.433
TO THE ONE LARA
MADE LAST WEEK.

32:58.466 --> 33:00.000
IT WAS AMAZING.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.067

33:02.067 --> 33:03.467
OH, YEAH, I WAS
GOING TO ASK YOU GUYS.

33:03.500 --> 33:07.299
WHEN YOU HAD MARTINA
AND TERESA OVER,

33:07.333 --> 33:07.934
WHAT DID THEY THINK
OF THAT SCULPTURE

33:07.968 --> 33:09.367
IN YOUR HOUSE?

33:09.400 --> 33:11.333
YOU KNOW THAT ONE
WITH TWO ATHLETE BODIES?

I'M SORRY.

33:26.367 --> 33:27.466
OH, YEAH.

33:27.501 --> 33:29.100
JENNY, TELL ME ABOUT YOUR BOOK,
YOUR EDITOR.

33:29.132 --> 33:31.067
HAVE YOU HEARD BACK
FROM THEM LATELY?

33:31.067 --> 33:32.834
NO, I THINK SHE HAS
A VERY BUSY SCHEDULE.

33:32.868 --> 33:33.801
OH...

33:33.834 --> 33:35.834
MOIRA, DO YOU READ
JENNY'S STUFF?

33:40.167 --> 33:40.968
THAT DOESN'T--
SO WHAT?

33:41.067 --> 33:42.133
DON'T SAY THAT.

33:42.167 --> 33:44.366
SO WHO IS THE EDITOR
THAT YOU SENT IT TO?

33:44.399 --> 33:45.466
THIS LADY

33:45.500 --> 33:46.968
NAMED JAN MARTIN.

33:47.067 --> 33:48.334
OH, MY GOD, JAN MARTIN.

33:48.366 --> 33:49.234
YOU KNOW HER?
YEAH, SHE'S FAMOUS.

33:49.267 --> 33:50.500
SHE'S THAT NEW YORK LADY

33:50.533 --> 33:51.567
YOU USED TO TELL ME ABOUT,
THE BIG EDITOR?

33:51.600 --> 33:52.834
THAT YOU ALWAYS
USED TO TALK ABOUT?

33:52.868 --> 33:54.399
DID YOU SEND IT TO HER DIRECTLY,

33:54.433 --> 33:56.634
OR DO YOU KNOW HER,
I MEAN, FROM SCHOOL?

33:56.667 --> 33:59.366
I MET HER BECAUSE HER DAUGHTER
WAS MY ROOMMATE IN THE HOSPITAL,

33:59.399 --> 34:02.334
SO JAN WOULD COME IN
AND VISIT HER.

34:02.367 --> 34:04.133
WAS HER DAUGHTER A...

34:04.166 --> 34:05.567
CUTTER, TOO?

34:05.601 --> 34:06.434
OH, GOD.

34:06.466 --> 34:08.199
ALICE...

34:08.234 --> 34:09.868
IT'S FINE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

34:09.900 --> 34:11.199
IT'S SO GOOD
TO TALK ABOUT IT,

34:11.234 --> 34:13.067
BECAUSE, FUCK IT,
IT HAPPENED,

34:13.067 --> 34:14.199
AND IT'S BETTER NOT
TO TIPTOE AROUND--

34:14.234 --> 34:16.132
WELL, THAT'S VERY GENEROUS
OF YOU.

34:16.167 --> 34:17.634
AND YOU'RE HEALTHY?

34:17.667 --> 34:18.867
I'M FINE.

34:18.900 --> 34:20.067
THAT'S ALL
THAT MATTERS, RIGHT?

34:20.067 --> 34:21.634
YUP.

34:21.667 --> 34:24.132
SO JAN MARTIN'S
DAUGHTER WAS SICK.

34:24.167 --> 34:26.132
SHE HAS AN EATING
DISORDER, AND THAT'S--

34:26.167 --> 34:28.501
OH, GOD, PLEASE, PLEASE.
THAT'S AWFUL.

34:28.533 --> 34:30.634
DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN
TO OUR DAUGHTER.

34:30.667 --> 34:31.701
I DON'T THINK IT'S
POSSIBLE TO CONTROL THAT,

34:31.734 --> 34:33.334
BUT I THINK
WHAT YOU CAN CONTROL

34:33.366 --> 34:35.067
IS HOW YOU COMMUNICATE WITH THEM
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED,

34:35.100 --> 34:36.234
GOING TO HAPPEN.

34:36.267 --> 34:37.734
WELL, I CAN
GUARANTEE YOU

34:37.767 --> 34:40.801
THAT NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO HER,
BECAUSE I WON'T LET IT.

34:40.834 --> 34:42.634
AW...

34:42.667 --> 34:43.834
I MEAN IT.

34:43.868 --> 34:44.868
AUNTIE SHANE.
I DO MEAN IT.

34:44.901 --> 34:47.533
[LAUGHTER]

34:47.567 --> 34:48.634
LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THIS
ANYMORE.

34:48.667 --> 34:49.968
IT'S GETTING TOO DARK.

34:50.067 --> 34:51.701
JUST TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE, OKAY?

34:51.734 --> 34:54.366
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

34:54.399 --> 34:55.399
I'M SORRY.

34:57.533 --> 34:59.200
SO YOU GUYS HAVE A KID?

34:59.234 --> 35:02.601
YEAH, A DAUGHTER.
SHE'S SIX MONTHS OLD.

35:02.633 --> 35:04.466
HER NAME'S ANGELICA.

IN WILMETTE,

35:07.466 --> 35:09.067
THEY'RE DOING THAT, TOO.

35:10.067 --> 35:11.199

35:34.234 --> 35:36.767
[SOFTLY]:
I THINK SHE'S ASLEEP.

35:42.234 --> 35:44.299
YOU SHOULD REALLY THINK

35:44.334 --> 35:46.100
ABOUT PUTTING OUT
YOUR OWN RECORD, KIT.

35:46.133 --> 35:50.267
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS...

35:50.299 --> 35:51.968
THIS INTERNET
AND DISTRIBUTION STUFF

35:52.067 --> 35:53.067
THAT THEY DO TODAY.

35:53.100 --> 35:54.500
IT'S EASY.

35:54.533 --> 35:57.366
MY BAND AND I ARE PUTTING OUT
OUR SECOND RECORD RIGHT NOW.

35:57.399 --> 35:59.133
REALLY?
