01:11.440 --> 01:12.640
Chapman!

01:15.280 --> 01:17.080
Chapman, let's go. Up, up, up.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.600
What? I'm up.

01:18.680 --> 01:19.840
On your feet.

01:19.920 --> 01:21.440
I thought...

01:21.520 --> 01:24.200
I thought that Foley was on duty tonight.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.680
Is it breakfast already?

01:27.760 --> 01:30.400
No, but if you're hungry, you
can lick yesterday's off the wall.

01:30.480 --> 01:31.440
Nasty.

01:31.520 --> 01:32.880
No, this...

01:34.120 --> 01:36.280
this... this is art.

01:37.360 --> 01:40.360
This is a yellow warbler
drinking out of a daffodil.

01:40.440 --> 01:43.280
She just cannot get enough.

01:44.240 --> 01:45.520
I'm calling it Thirsty Bird.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.600
It's almost done.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.720
Smells like old Easter in here.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.240
I hate cooked yolks.

01:50.320 --> 01:51.480
Well, you won't be finishing...

01:51.560 --> 01:52.680
Why? What's happening?

01:52.760 --> 01:53.920
... or annoying the living crap out of me.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.640
Stand up on your goddamn feet, inmate!

01:56.720 --> 01:57.800
Do you need to pee?

01:57.880 --> 02:00.000
I need to know what's going on.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.000
If there was a hearing, I
was entitled to be there.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.760
Are you taking...
am I going to max?

02:03.840 --> 02:05.200
Remember, I asked.

02:06.440 --> 02:09.600
That warbler looks like
the yellow Angry Bird.

02:11.040 --> 02:12.000
Please...

02:12.080 --> 02:14.880
is this about Pennsatucky?

02:14.960 --> 02:16.960
Please.

02:17.040 --> 02:19.360
What happened to her?

02:19.440 --> 02:20.600
Where are we going?

02:20.680 --> 02:22.720
Into this van.

02:22.800 --> 02:23.920
Am I going back to camp?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.240
Ask me more questions. Go ahead.

02:32.480 --> 02:35.200
Shit, you couldn't warm
this bitch up first?

02:35.280 --> 02:36.800
Not a lot of warning on this one.

02:36.880 --> 02:38.680
Please tell me where we're going.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.400
Are we going back to camp?

02:41.480 --> 02:43.040
Just a yes or a no.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.600
- Hey...
- A head nod?

02:44.680 --> 02:46.840
... what's up with the Mila
Kunis chick from New Year's?

02:46.920 --> 02:47.880
Total psycho.

02:47.960 --> 02:48.920
She texted me yesterday,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.080
"How about we meet before
10:00 p.m. sometime."

02:51.160 --> 02:53.280
With a period, not a question mark.

02:53.360 --> 02:54.320
The fuck?

02:54.400 --> 02:55.640
Ordering me around.

02:55.720 --> 02:58.400
And she's got that Kunis face, but
she does not have that Kunis ass.

02:58.480 --> 03:01.800
And you gotta have that Kunis ass if
you're gonna be tellin', not asking.

03:01.880 --> 03:02.880
You got to have the ass.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.920
Can't abide by demanding
flat-ass poochies.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.480
- Mmm-mmm.
- Poochies?

03:06.560 --> 03:09.200
Can't
say "bitches" no more.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.400
It's degrading.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.160
Van nine,
you're cleared to go.

03:27.440 --> 03:30.360
- Processing out.
- Processing out? Processing out?

03:30.440 --> 03:31.760
Processing out of the SHU?

03:31.840 --> 03:33.120
I'm digging the fresh shave.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.600
No?

03:34.680 --> 03:36.840
No. Then what am I processing out of?

03:37.640 --> 03:39.040
Come around back.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.280
What am I processing out of?

03:41.360 --> 03:43.360
Good luck with it, Chapman.

03:49.240 --> 03:51.520
Is that for me?

03:51.600 --> 03:53.600
Okay, these things...

03:53.680 --> 03:56.120
- These are really tight.
- Yep.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.720
I still have basic human rights.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.440
You cannot put me on a mystery
bus in the middle of the night

04:00.520 --> 04:02.760
and not tell me where I'm going.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.520
I demand to know where I am being taken!

04:04.600 --> 04:06.080
Can't abide demanding poochies.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.320
Get your flat ass on the bus.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.040
Take a seat.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.120
Inmate!

04:31.120 --> 04:32.400
Cool it.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.040
He's looking!

04:34.120 --> 04:36.080
- So?
- So we'll get in trouble.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.040
No one's getting in trouble, Piper.

04:38.120 --> 04:41.960
Last year, Marcy Klein broke her ankle.
She had to get pins in it or something.

04:42.040 --> 04:44.560
Yeah, 'cause she tried to
do a herkie on her way out.

04:44.640 --> 04:47.320
Come on, we're all going to Ryan's after.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.600
We're getting close. You guys ready?

04:50.520 --> 04:52.720
Ew, he wears cologne. It's gross.

04:53.880 --> 04:56.520
If my dad finds out, I'm
totally getting grounded.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.320
And if your dad doesn't find out,

04:58.400 --> 05:00.680
maybe we'll be invited to
Ryan's New Year's Eve party.

05:00.760 --> 05:05.440
Maybe we won't go into next semester
being the same lame losers we are now.

05:05.520 --> 05:08.160
I don't have to jump off
a bus to prove I'm fun.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.200
I'm fun.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.320
I know that. Just...

05:11.400 --> 05:13.200
no one else really does.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.800
Come on.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.440
Here we go.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.880
Have a rad Christmas, Ralph!

05:18.960 --> 05:19.920
Go!

05:33.400 --> 05:34.400
Hey...

05:34.480 --> 05:38.000
I understand Nicole and
Bojing, but why didn't you jump?

05:38.080 --> 05:41.440
I slowed to 5 miles an
hour. It's tradition.

05:41.520 --> 05:42.880
Unnecessary risk.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.480
You're one of those.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.720
My dad says I should have
strength of character,

05:46.800 --> 05:47.760
not be a lemming.

05:48.880 --> 05:52.040
Hey, daddy's girl, get
the door for me, will you?

06:19.560 --> 06:20.520
Hey...

06:21.720 --> 06:23.040
do you know where we're going?

06:23.120 --> 06:25.680
Hoping for Mississippi.

06:25.760 --> 06:26.800
What?

06:28.280 --> 06:30.240
How can they not tell us where we're going?

06:30.320 --> 06:31.280
This is so fucked!

06:31.360 --> 06:32.560
Hush it!

06:35.640 --> 06:37.200
Oh, I should've peed!

06:39.720 --> 06:40.680
Excuse me.

06:41.880 --> 06:44.480
Is there any way that we
can stop for a bathroom?

07:07.480 --> 07:09.160
Are we getting off?

07:10.360 --> 07:13.720
Why do you keep thinking I
know what the bus schedule is?

07:13.800 --> 07:15.800
I don't know shit... same as you.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.720
All the way to the back!

07:17.800 --> 07:19.560
It's just that I gotta pee so badly.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.840
They have to let us pee, right?

07:24.120 --> 07:26.640
You think I should ask
again? Should I ask...

07:26.720 --> 07:29.280
They ain't gonna let you pee. No
one told you to wear a pee pad?

07:29.360 --> 07:31.720
- A what?
- A pee pad.

07:31.800 --> 07:35.280
Two maxis stacked so
they like a maxi-maxi.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.600
And then you just let
out a little at a time.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.880
Now, some people do two down

07:40.960 --> 07:44.480
and then one across the front,
one across the back like a diaper,

07:44.560 --> 07:46.640
but me, I just do a double stack.

07:46.720 --> 07:49.600
Nobody told me. I've been
in seg for the last month.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.520
I'm doin' it right now.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.440
Here we go, ladies. Exit to the front.

08:09.520 --> 08:10.880
An airplane?

08:10.960 --> 08:12.160
We're getting on a fucking airplane?

08:12.240 --> 08:13.440
Let's go.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.120
Stick out your tongue.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.600
All right. Next!

08:28.360 --> 08:30.160
Stick out your tongue.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.280
Up.

08:33.360 --> 08:36.160
- Up!
- I got a tight lingual frenulum.

08:36.240 --> 08:37.480
I really don't need to know about that.

08:37.560 --> 08:40.960
Stick it up or I'll rip it out. Come on.

08:41.040 --> 08:42.800
Oh, Christ.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.720
That's not mine.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.000
Fucker.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.040
- Come on.
- Let me go!

08:47.120 --> 08:48.160
- Get her covered.
- Let me go!

08:48.240 --> 08:51.040
Write up assault and
occupational exposure, please.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.680
Next!

08:55.600 --> 08:56.840
You're not a spitter, are you?

08:56.920 --> 08:58.560
No, sir.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.240
Not hiding anything?

09:03.320 --> 09:05.720
Just a very, very full bladder.

09:05.800 --> 09:06.960
Stick out your tongue.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.880
Up.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.520
All right. Remind me on the
plane. I'll get you to a bathroom.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.200
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you for not peeing your pants.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.520
Hey, can you tell me where we're going?

09:14.600 --> 09:15.880
Nope. Next!

09:15.960 --> 09:17.520
Let's go. Today.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.240
Here.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.960
- What was that?
- It's normal.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.560
It's her first time on an airplane.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.640
I can't talk. I gotta pee.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.680
Can't walk and chew gum at the same time?

09:39.760 --> 09:41.440
Whatever.

09:45.320 --> 09:47.440
Sit. Stay.

09:48.560 --> 09:50.880
Sir... um...

09:50.960 --> 09:52.480
- the restroom?
- Oh, right.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.560
Let me just get you a female
Marshal here. Sit tight.

09:54.640 --> 09:57.120
No, see, I...  I've been sitting
tight for about five hours.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.400
Please, I'm all good with a male guard.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.000
I'm a Marshal. Guards work at the beach.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.920
Please don't mention anything that's
near a body of water right now.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.520
All right, follow me.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.160
Okay, thank you.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.600
- Where's the...
- No door. Let's go.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.400
Ohh.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.520
Everyone's on, sir.

10:28.600 --> 10:32.080
Great, tell the pilots we're
running final security check.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.800
Can you, uh... kind of hurry it up a bit?

10:35.880 --> 10:37.480
I'm going as fast as I can.

10:37.560 --> 10:39.600
Really? 'Cause it sounds a little light.

10:41.480 --> 10:42.640
Better.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.240
In the movies, there's always
this thing about oxygen masks.

10:49.320 --> 10:52.320
They come out of the ceiling or somethin'.
Is someone gonna tell us about those?

10:52.400 --> 10:53.360
Oh, excuse me.

10:53.440 --> 10:54.800
Polite.

10:57.840 --> 10:59.360
Damn. Tight.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.200
You must've really pissed
off whoever put these on.

11:01.280 --> 11:04.440
I was a demanding poochie.

11:04.520 --> 11:05.560
Do you tell us where we're going

11:05.640 --> 11:07.880
or do you guys hand out
blindfolds when we land?

11:07.960 --> 11:09.920
Oh, a frisky one.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.360
I like that.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.400
Seat belts.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.920
- All clear!
- All clear.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.880
- All clear.
- All clear.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.400
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, it's moving.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.960
We're moving.

11:26.040 --> 11:27.840
This thing must be,
like, a bazillion pounds.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.280
How's it gonna fly?

11:29.360 --> 11:31.800
You know, I read once that you
have a better chance of dying

11:31.880 --> 11:34.880
from the food on an airplane
than in an actual crash.

11:34.960 --> 11:39.040
Do they serve food on this flight?
Won't that make the plane heavier?

11:40.680 --> 11:41.840
Close the shade...

11:41.920 --> 11:44.240
and pretend you're on the subway.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.240
My cousin died in a subway crash.

11:49.800 --> 11:50.760
Okay.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.560
What the fuck? Is she asleep?

11:56.640 --> 11:58.440
Boy, I hope so.

11:58.520 --> 11:59.800
Do you think that I should get somebody?

11:59.880 --> 12:01.680
No! No, hell, no.

12:04.360 --> 12:06.240
It must be a stress thing.

12:06.320 --> 12:09.400
When I get agitated, I get
this really weird eye twitch.

12:09.480 --> 12:12.000
Although it's not happening right now.

12:13.520 --> 12:17.680
I think I've moved beyond stress
into something more deeply disturbing.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.160
I got Vaseline.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.400
A friend of mine, she took this flight,

12:23.480 --> 12:28.160
and she said it was so long and so dry
that her whole face almost cracked open.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.720
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.080
No, I got a whole glob
if you want some later.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.120
I don't want any.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.560
I'll take some of
that. It's dry as shit in here.

12:34.640 --> 12:35.760
Come on, help me out.

12:35.840 --> 12:36.880
Here.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.920
Even if I was willing to touch her ear glob

12:41.000 --> 12:42.800
and even if I could reach across the aisle

12:42.880 --> 12:45.760
with these shackles on
and no guard noticing,

12:45.840 --> 12:47.520
what makes you think that I could

12:47.600 --> 12:49.880
get up underneath that
mask and touch your lips?

12:49.960 --> 12:50.920
Fuck you then, bitch.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.440
You ain't even willin' to try?

12:53.520 --> 12:55.080
Sorry.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.040
Well, this one really thinks
shit through, don't she?

12:57.120 --> 13:01.120
Shut your ugly face. No one ever
tell you crack kills?

13:03.240 --> 13:05.920
Makes me miss when this one was conscious.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.080
Lolly.

13:09.160 --> 13:10.880
- Piper.
- Hey.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.920
Please tell me you know
where this plane is going.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Nope.

13:15.120 --> 13:18.800
But if it's got heat and a bed,
it's better than where I been.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.040
You do something really bad?

13:24.120 --> 13:25.840
Well, it wasn't good.

13:28.800 --> 13:33.080
I did something kind of bad...
and I was doing my time for it.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.720
Mmm-hmm.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.120
And then I did this, uh...

13:37.200 --> 13:39.040
I did this other thing.

13:41.680 --> 13:45.000
I did this
really, really bad thing...

13:45.080 --> 13:47.920
and I think maybe I'm going away for it...

13:48.000 --> 13:49.520
for a long time.

13:55.720 --> 13:58.000
What...
Did you...

13:58.080 --> 13:59.360
did you kill somebody?

13:59.440 --> 14:00.880
I don't know.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.760
I don't know.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.520
I mean, this girl...

14:06.560 --> 14:10.400
this girl, she was coming after
me and she was not gonna stop.

14:10.480 --> 14:11.840
And...

14:11.920 --> 14:13.920
she...

14:14.000 --> 14:15.040
is...

14:16.600 --> 14:17.720
or was...

14:19.760 --> 14:21.920
She was...

14:22.000 --> 14:23.120
relentless.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.760
I mean, just crazy.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.680
So...

14:27.760 --> 14:29.160
so...

14:29.240 --> 14:30.360
crazy.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.720
And I completely lost it.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.120
I just, uh...

14:37.560 --> 14:39.240
I just went there...

14:39.320 --> 14:41.440
and I didn't...

14:41.520 --> 14:46.240
I didn't even really know
that there was a there there.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.440
But, um...

14:49.560 --> 14:50.520
I don't know

14:50.600 --> 14:53.160
if it just grew there recently
or if it's always been there,

14:53.240 --> 14:56.120
but that really... that dark place.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.200
That place...

14:58.280 --> 15:00.360
that let me just keep on...

15:00.440 --> 15:02.080
hitting her...

15:02.160 --> 15:03.760
and hitting her...

15:04.920 --> 15:06.320
and... and, uh...

15:07.560 --> 15:08.880
hitting her.

15:12.480 --> 15:14.000
I couldn't stop.

15:15.800 --> 15:18.160
I couldn't stop.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.840
Hmm.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.360
That's some shit, man.

15:35.280 --> 15:37.800
Hello, passengers, we
wanna thank you for flying with us today.

15:37.880 --> 15:40.360
We know you have a choice in
your air travel...

15:40.440 --> 15:43.560
Kidding! You have no choice at all
'cause you're prisoners... our prisoners.

15:43.640 --> 15:47.160
Anyhoo, please note the exit rows
located in the middle of the plane.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.400
In the case of a water landing,

15:48.480 --> 15:51.080
we strongly suggest you do
not try and swim to freedom.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.640
Remember it's winter...
and hypothermia hurts.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.200
Your seat cushion may be
used as a floatation device.

15:56.280 --> 15:58.440
Please make sure your
seatbelts are securely fastened.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.120
If the oxygen masks come down,

16:00.200 --> 16:02.560
just push them back into
the panel above your seat.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.320
We're having some issues with those.

16:04.400 --> 16:07.280
Sit back, relax and enjoy
our in-flight entertainment,

16:07.360 --> 16:10.240
which is... staring off into space.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.680
Piper, will you please take
off those stupid glasses?

16:16.760 --> 16:19.960
Fine, but stop saying my
name. I'm Zoe. Call me Zoe.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.240
Okay, Zoe. Here he comes.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.840
Here you go. Two tix to Dazed and Confused.

16:24.920 --> 16:27.000
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.280
What if it's rated R because

16:28.360 --> 16:32.200
something really inappropriate happens,
something that scars us for life?

16:32.280 --> 16:35.720
Will you stop? We've got
the tickets. It's all cool.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.680
Why not try to enjoy it?

16:38.800 --> 16:40.280
Oh, my God, my father!

16:40.360 --> 16:42.520
Yeah, right.
Quit being such a spaz.

16:42.600 --> 16:43.840
No, seriously, look across the street.

16:45.040 --> 16:46.400
That's my dad!

16:46.480 --> 16:48.560
- Oh, shit.
- See?

16:49.840 --> 16:51.280
Oh, shit.

16:51.360 --> 16:52.640
Who is that?

17:00.160 --> 17:03.080
Maybe the movie will take your mind off it.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.440
I gave the guy 10 extra bucks
to buy the tickets for us.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.960
Fuck my shit!

17:19.040 --> 17:21.440
- Are we there?
- Oh, jeez, I'm sorry.

17:21.520 --> 17:23.200
We're somewhere.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.760
How long was I asleep for?

17:25.840 --> 17:28.880
I don't know. I left my
watch back with my freedom.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.520
All right, listen up. New
inmates will be joining us.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.440
Remember, there is no touching.

17:33.520 --> 17:37.040
Keep your hands and your feet and
your legs and your hair and your face

17:37.120 --> 17:39.240
and all your other body parts to yourself.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.400
If you cannot abide by this request,

17:41.480 --> 17:43.440
we'll arrange for a nice
little spot for you in seg

17:43.520 --> 17:44.720
upon your arrival.

17:44.800 --> 17:48.000
You wanna stay out of trouble,
just avoid eye-contact.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.400
Settle down, people.

17:53.480 --> 17:57.240
Oh, baby! I think you overshot first class.

17:58.920 --> 17:59.880
Jay?

17:59.960 --> 18:01.440
No way! Spongie?

18:01.520 --> 18:02.840
Shit, girl, you got picked up?

18:02.920 --> 18:04.720
Yeah, fuckin' Robbie.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.360
- Where he at?
- Not here.

18:06.440 --> 18:10.160
Gentlemen, sit your asses
in your assigned seats.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.840
I got a seat for you, mommy.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.400
Got it all warmed up for you.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.560
You a bad girl, huh?

18:19.640 --> 18:23.200
You think the suburbs over there
can pop her puss like a sister?

18:23.280 --> 18:25.760
Black men get all snow blind.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.000
Don't know how good they got it

18:27.080 --> 18:29.520
with a cinnamon queen that
knows how to handle her business.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.520
I got plenty for you too, boo.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.280
Mmm-hmm.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.760
Ain't that right, First Class?

18:37.120 --> 18:39.360
You can share.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.880
I can make you share.

18:43.480 --> 18:45.680
Eyes front. Eyes front.

18:52.640 --> 18:55.040
Hold up, hold up. Let me help you.

18:55.120 --> 18:56.160
Here.

18:57.840 --> 19:00.080
Oh, thank you. I'm starving.

19:01.360 --> 19:04.120
It's gonna be so weird
gettin' fed every day.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.200
I'm probably gonna get fat.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.600
I see mountains! I think
we're in the Midwest.

19:10.680 --> 19:13.320
Ain't no mountains in the Midwest, dumbass.

19:13.400 --> 19:15.840
There's plains and corn...

19:15.920 --> 19:18.320
and a shit ton of white people who
don't vote in their best interests.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.960
Excuse me, Carmen Sandiego.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.600
Didn't realize we had a
geography expert on board.

19:23.680 --> 19:26.640
Hell, maybe
we're going to Vegas, baby.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.320
Marshals,
prepare for landing.

19:33.160 --> 19:34.560
Chicago?

21:52.720 --> 21:56.920
Now, everyone, turn
around and grab your ankles.

22:00.320 --> 22:03.520
I said, turn around and grab your ankles.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.440
If you're feeling shy,

22:05.520 --> 22:08.520
I can set you up with a
private show and tell...

22:12.240 --> 22:13.880
in solitary.

22:18.240 --> 22:20.720
Let's get those moons rising, ladies.

22:25.600 --> 22:26.880
Line up!

22:26.960 --> 22:27.920
Females walking.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.480
Secure the unit!

22:30.880 --> 22:32.480
No talking!

22:35.960 --> 22:38.040
Against the wall.

22:43.240 --> 22:46.840
You, you, you, you... let's go.

22:46.920 --> 22:49.800
1278-1945?

22:49.880 --> 22:50.840
That's me.

22:50.920 --> 22:52.640
You're up here.

22:52.720 --> 22:55.480
Unit A, cell 21, bunk five.

22:55.560 --> 22:58.200
Will I be able to
speak with my counselor soon?

22:58.280 --> 23:01.280
I haven't been told why I'm
here or how long I'm staying.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.000
Have I been resentenced?

23:03.080 --> 23:06.800
All I know, unit A, cell 21, bunk five.

23:12.480 --> 23:13.640
Hey!

23:13.720 --> 23:14.880
Step off it!

23:14.960 --> 23:17.040
- Hey!
- Step off what... Oh, God!

23:17.120 --> 23:18.880
Yeah, you better be
prayin' to God about now.

23:18.960 --> 23:21.280
Him, Baby Jesus, Buddha, whoever else

23:21.360 --> 23:24.800
might look out for dumbass bitches
don't look before they stomp.

23:24.880 --> 23:28.080
I told you to
be overly cautious today.

23:28.160 --> 23:32.160
I said you've got to slow
down in order to excel.

23:32.240 --> 23:35.800
I told you to quit it with
that cosmic voodoo shit.

23:35.880 --> 23:37.040
Yeah, he's dead.

23:37.120 --> 23:38.920
She killed Yoda.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.280
I'm so sorry. Was Yoda
your pet or something?

23:41.360 --> 23:43.280
He was our prize, pendeja.

23:44.320 --> 23:46.320
I would be more than happy
to replace your prize.

23:46.400 --> 23:48.400
You think it's so simple to replace Yoda?

23:48.480 --> 23:50.480
You owe us a motherfucking master, bitch.

23:51.280 --> 23:53.320
Okay, what was he master of?

23:54.840 --> 23:56.040
These nuts...

23:56.120 --> 23:59.720
they train cockroaches to run smokes
back and forth to solitary, you know?

23:59.800 --> 24:01.760
Most of 'em make it one
way, if they're lucky,

24:01.840 --> 24:03.440
but Yoda always came back.

24:03.520 --> 24:05.560
He's not coming back this time.

24:06.720 --> 24:07.960
You guys are fucking with me.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.280
Yoda brought in 200 stamps last week.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.960
You owe us a new Yoda or 400 stamps a week.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.200
You said two.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.840
Well, now we sayin' four...
by week's end. And so you know,

24:16.920 --> 24:20.840
Celi's way of collecting debt
has not been approved by the FCC.

24:20.920 --> 24:24.720
It's gotta be at least two inches
long... but no longer than four.

24:24.800 --> 24:25.960
I'll do my best.

24:26.040 --> 24:28.320
That's right you will.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.320
Poor little Jedi never saw it comin'.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.400
Well, uh...

24:35.480 --> 24:37.320
we have two bunks available.

24:37.400 --> 24:41.600
Uh, one over Joyce and five's over me.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.880
What are you assigned to?

24:42.960 --> 24:44.600
Five... thankfully.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.320
Gemini?

24:47.400 --> 24:48.960
How did you know?

24:49.040 --> 24:51.200
- It's a thing.
- Oh.

24:51.280 --> 24:52.240
What's your birthday?

24:52.320 --> 24:53.400
June 7th.

24:53.480 --> 24:54.520
What year?

24:55.440 --> 24:56.400
1981.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.320
What time were you born?

25:01.640 --> 25:03.320
Um, I'm not sure.

25:03.400 --> 25:05.320
Your mom never told you your birth story?

25:05.400 --> 25:08.160
I was born in a huge snowstorm in October,

25:08.240 --> 25:09.920
which is weird for Michigan.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Muskegon.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.960
I was born at 4:00 in
the morning... on the dot.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.200
Are there instructions for making the bed?

25:17.280 --> 25:19.480
Have you never made a bed before?

25:21.680 --> 25:24.480
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't watch a lot of TV.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.920
Are you famous or something? Or...

25:28.000 --> 25:28.960
You're Lindsay Lohan.

25:29.040 --> 25:32.000
No, I mean for inspection. I'm Chapman.

25:32.080 --> 25:34.080
Oh! Mazall.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.880
So we spend all day in here together?

25:36.960 --> 25:38.600
Except meals...

25:38.680 --> 25:42.600
and one hour a day rec time
and one day a week in the yard.

25:42.680 --> 25:44.400
Otherwise, home sweet home.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.720
"Home sweet home."

25:47.800 --> 25:49.240
That's dinner.

25:51.480 --> 25:54.480
Keep them blue eyes on the floor, chica.

25:54.560 --> 25:56.600
And don't even bother with the fast ones.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.680
It's the slowbies that train the best.

26:05.560 --> 26:06.560
Are they for real?

26:07.920 --> 26:10.480
They're pretty serious about their roaches.

26:14.760 --> 26:16.400
... so
leave a message after the beep.

26:16.480 --> 26:18.800
Hey, it's me. It's Piper.

26:19.760 --> 26:20.800
Your name Piper?

26:22.000 --> 26:22.960
Yeah.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.400
You know Snazz?

26:24.480 --> 26:25.880
No.

26:25.960 --> 26:29.960
Snazzy told me a story once about a
girl she used to dance with named Piper.

26:30.040 --> 26:32.800
Said she could blow out candles
with her coochie.

26:32.880 --> 26:34.480
Sorry, different Piper.

26:35.440 --> 26:36.720
All right.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.520
Larry, I fucked up.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.400
I really fucked everything up...

26:45.480 --> 26:48.880
and not in a fun-loving
"Oh, that's so Piper" way...

26:48.960 --> 26:52.200
which I know was growing very old...

26:52.280 --> 26:53.360
but, um...

26:55.120 --> 26:56.880
this is serious...

26:56.960 --> 26:58.640
and I'm...

26:59.840 --> 27:02.360
I'm not sure it can be made right.

27:02.440 --> 27:03.960
And I'm sorry...

27:06.320 --> 27:10.200
I'm sorry to have to pull you back
into my Tilt-A-Whirl of a life...

27:10.280 --> 27:11.880
but I need you to call your dad for me...

27:12.600 --> 27:13.560
and tell him that

27:13.640 --> 27:16.800
I'm in the Metropolitan
Detention Center in Chicago.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.240
Tell him I need his help.

27:21.360 --> 27:23.400
Please, he's gotta help get me out of here.

27:23.480 --> 27:25.040
You guys will be feeders.

27:25.120 --> 27:28.280
Push the cart in, distribute
the trays, push the cart out.

27:28.360 --> 27:29.600
That's it.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.200
Cleaners'll do the rest.

27:31.280 --> 27:32.880
All right, let's keep walking.

27:34.640 --> 27:39.800
♪You're the key
to my peace of mind ♪

27:39.800 --> 27:43.000
♪ Cause you make me feel ♪

27:43.000 --> 27:46.480
♪ You make me feel ♪

27:46.480 --> 27:48.640

27:50.160 --> 27:54.320

27:54.360 --> 27:56.320
♪ Woman ♪

27:56.360 --> 27:58.880
Hey, white girl, how the search comin'?

27:59.880 --> 28:02.200
There are no real contenders
yet, but I remain hopeful.

28:02.280 --> 28:05.240
Let me...  tell you somethin'.

28:05.320 --> 28:09.160
Fucking Feds locked me up here
five months now waitin' for trial.

28:09.240 --> 28:10.880
I lost my job, my car.

28:10.960 --> 28:14.320
I'm scraping pennies together
to keep my kids in the apartment.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.200
You know where them pennies come from?

28:16.280 --> 28:20.040
Yodas... gremlins... Fred Savage IIIs.

28:20.120 --> 28:23.080
Now Celi over here workin'
hard to get Smokie up to speed,

28:23.160 --> 28:24.720
but it ain't goin' so well.

28:24.800 --> 28:27.640
So how about, instead of
you "remaining hopeful,"

28:27.720 --> 28:30.800
you go sit in front of that door and
start grabbin' what comes under it?

28:31.920 --> 28:34.080
I'm just supposed to grab it with my hands?

28:34.160 --> 28:35.120
And then what?

28:35.200 --> 28:37.160
Deliver. I mean it.

28:37.240 --> 28:40.480
Get on that floor, make like
you one giant, blonde crumb,

28:40.560 --> 28:42.960
and grab yourself a fine carachacha now.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.680
Mmm-hmm, that a girl.

28:51.920 --> 28:53.160
Hey...

28:53.240 --> 28:54.720
can you call your mom?

28:54.800 --> 28:56.640
I really need to know your time of birth.

28:56.720 --> 29:00.680
It'll help me figure out how strong
your powers of attraction are.

29:00.760 --> 29:03.760
That's mostly for sexual partners...

29:03.840 --> 29:05.120
not insects.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.160
Mom?

29:11.440 --> 29:12.560
A hand would be nice.

29:14.280 --> 29:16.320
Mom, I have to tell you something.

29:16.400 --> 29:17.920
What?

29:18.000 --> 29:19.240
Oh, good heavens.

29:19.320 --> 29:22.240
The Neals finally decide to
repaint and they choose that color?

29:22.320 --> 29:23.800
I've gotta call Barbara.

29:23.880 --> 29:25.400
Wait, Mom?

29:25.480 --> 29:26.800
What?

29:26.880 --> 29:29.840
I really wanna talk to
you about something I saw.

29:29.920 --> 29:32.920
Was it worse than the
Neals' puke-green house?

29:33.000 --> 29:33.960
Yes.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.680
Well, that's saying something.

29:35.760 --> 29:36.840
What is it, dear?

29:37.840 --> 29:41.440
Well, the other day, Sara and I
went to the movies at the Suffolk.

29:41.520 --> 29:44.760
- Sara B. or Sara H.?
- Sara H.

29:44.840 --> 29:46.880
Hmm. Go on.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.000
I... I saw Daddy.

29:50.760 --> 29:51.760
Okay.

29:52.720 --> 29:54.280
He was with someone.

29:56.440 --> 29:58.120
A lady someone.

29:58.200 --> 29:59.640
He kissed her.

30:03.760 --> 30:07.440
What movie did you and
Sara H. see at the Suffolk?

30:07.520 --> 30:09.320
Um, Dazed and
Confused, but...

30:09.400 --> 30:11.920
Piper Elizabeth
Chapman, you're grounded.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.160
What?

30:13.240 --> 30:16.480
That is an R-rated
movie and you are not 17,

30:16.560 --> 30:20.400
and I did not give you
permission to see that movie.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.600
How do you even get tickets?

30:22.680 --> 30:25.800
You know, I don't want you
hanging around with that Sara H.

30:25.880 --> 30:28.040
She is a bad influence.

30:29.560 --> 30:32.240
Please put away the groceries
while I call Barbara.

30:33.120 --> 30:36.600
You know, that color is
actually making me feel nauseous.

30:36.680 --> 30:37.840
I feel queasy.

30:43.240 --> 30:47.200
Grab a coat and a hat... if you dare.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.040
You're feelin' lucky.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.800
You lookin' for a pet there?

30:56.880 --> 30:57.840
Uh...

30:58.640 --> 31:01.680
No, it's a, uh... it's a long story.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.080
Come keep warm with us.

31:05.160 --> 31:07.680
We rotate every five minutes like penguins.

31:09.720 --> 31:11.480
Got someplace else to be?

31:12.760 --> 31:13.760
No.

31:17.520 --> 31:19.880
Tina, Birdie, Elaine Toromocho.

31:19.960 --> 31:22.160
- Chapman.
- Hello.

31:24.240 --> 31:27.080
Have a turn in the middle.

31:27.160 --> 31:30.240
Fuckin' penguin daddies are fuckin' men.

31:30.320 --> 31:33.680
Imagine our baby-daddies
staying in one spot,

31:33.760 --> 31:34.720
no food,

31:34.800 --> 31:38.800
taking care of the kids for months
all alone in the freezing cold.

31:38.880 --> 31:40.080
No way.

31:40.160 --> 31:41.520
You know...

31:41.600 --> 31:43.520
emperor penguins are set up for that...

31:44.600 --> 31:45.880
physiologically speaking.

31:45.960 --> 31:49.400
They have short feathers and
an underlayer of woolly down.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.680
I did a report on penguins once.

31:51.760 --> 31:53.720
Uh-huh.

31:55.840 --> 31:57.080
But yeah, fuckin' men.

31:57.160 --> 31:58.640
Piper!

31:58.720 --> 32:00.720
- How you holding up?
- Eh.

32:00.800 --> 32:02.560
Your voice annoys me.

32:02.640 --> 32:03.800
Keep walking.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.080
Fuck you. I'm saying hi to my friend.

32:05.160 --> 32:06.360
- She's your friend?
- Hey...

32:06.440 --> 32:07.960
We met on
the, uh...

32:08.040 --> 32:09.840
Yeah, I asked you a
yes-or-no question.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.480
Hey, I wouldn't start
shit with her if I was you.

32:12.560 --> 32:15.720
She's here 'cause she killed
another inmate with her bare hands.

32:16.720 --> 32:18.480
- Huh.
- You did.

32:18.560 --> 32:20.960
So you've been down before, princess?

32:22.480 --> 32:23.440
Litchfield.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.040
Knuckled her?

32:26.800 --> 32:29.440
Did you get to feel the bones crack?

32:30.760 --> 32:32.280
Yes, actually.

32:33.400 --> 32:34.600
So, Piper, what unit you in?

32:34.680 --> 32:36.440
Christ...

32:36.520 --> 32:39.200
you have to take that
molest-me-Daddy voice

32:39.280 --> 32:42.160
and go someplace else right now.

32:42.240 --> 32:44.120
Fuck you, Menopause.

32:44.200 --> 32:47.160
Fuck you, G.I. Jane Doe!

32:47.240 --> 32:48.200
Oh, that's what we gonna do now?

32:48.280 --> 32:49.520
Oh, we are gonna play.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.200
Fuck off, you piece of shit!

32:51.280 --> 32:52.480
You want to get in on me?

32:54.600 --> 32:56.880
Get down! Get down, you bitch! Fuck you!

32:58.760 --> 32:59.720
Piper!

32:59.800 --> 33:01.760
Inmates, up
against the wall! Let's go!

33:01.840 --> 33:02.960
Piper, help me.

33:03.040 --> 33:04.480
Everybody, line up!

33:04.560 --> 33:05.800
Outdoor time is over.

33:05.880 --> 33:07.520
B and C unit,
off the roof right now.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.080
Let's go. Let's go. Back to your cells.

33:09.160 --> 33:10.440
- Get up against the wall.
- Alex.

33:10.520 --> 33:11.520
Everyone, move.

33:11.600 --> 33:13.240
- Alex!
- Up against the wall now!

33:14.160 --> 33:17.200
Turn around. Come on, show's over.

33:18.160 --> 33:19.120
Alex!

33:20.240 --> 33:23.000
Move up against the
wall. Don't you mess around here.

33:24.960 --> 33:30.640
You have a Mercury trine Mars,
which is a really compelling dynamic.

33:34.760 --> 33:37.000
I'm gonna work your chart
and get back to you, okay?

33:38.000 --> 33:39.560
Hey!

33:39.640 --> 33:41.800
Roaches are usually found on the ground.

33:42.760 --> 33:45.520
I saw someone I know in the
yard. I need to find her.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.240
Uh... she might be in another unit.

33:48.320 --> 33:51.480
You know, we... we go out with
B and C, but we only eat with A.

33:51.560 --> 33:53.840
But we won't be out in
the yard for another week.

33:53.920 --> 33:55.600
Do we see any other
units at any other times?

33:55.680 --> 33:57.160
We have the same rec time,

33:57.240 --> 33:59.320
but the gate pretty much keeps us separate.

33:59.400 --> 34:01.880
Hey, did you get a chance to
get your birth information?

34:01.960 --> 34:04.000
'Cause Mercury's gonna
be in retrograde soon

34:04.080 --> 34:06.200
and you really don't wanna get
caught with your pants down.

34:06.280 --> 34:07.800
Can I have this?

34:07.880 --> 34:10.440
Um... That's... I need that...

34:12.880 --> 34:15.320
Hey, hey.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.280
Hey there, First Class.

34:19.280 --> 34:20.240
I need a favor.

34:20.320 --> 34:24.360
They said the fatties would
be the ones askin' for an extra tray.

34:24.440 --> 34:27.360
No, I need to get a note to somebody
and I'm not sure what unit she's in.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.680
I thought maybe you could,
um, pass this to her?

34:30.640 --> 34:31.840
What does she look like?

34:31.920 --> 34:36.480
5'9", long black hair... secretary glasses.

34:36.560 --> 34:37.640
Her name is Alex Vause.

34:38.640 --> 34:41.200
What are you willing to give?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.600
A kiss?

34:46.360 --> 34:47.320
This is important.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.520
I can feel that.

34:50.320 --> 34:51.600
Okay, with my hand?

34:53.360 --> 34:55.280
I'm a predator, bitch.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.920
Ain't no fun if you offer.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.720
Well, there's nowhere for you to
violently assault me in private here.

34:59.800 --> 35:00.760
So what do you want?

35:03.880 --> 35:05.520
Your panties.

35:06.480 --> 35:09.840
They haven't given us new ones yet.
I've been wearing these for four days.

35:10.880 --> 35:12.280
Even better.

35:14.640 --> 35:16.280
I'll be right back.

35:27.880 --> 35:29.200
Alex Vause.

35:34.040 --> 35:35.000
For a girl with a deadline,

35:35.080 --> 35:37.520
you sure got a lot of time for
socializing with the gun over there.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.200
- This ain't a game.
- Gun?

35:39.280 --> 35:42.000
My girl know him from the
outside. He kill people for money.

35:42.960 --> 35:43.920
He's a hitman?

35:44.000 --> 35:45.120
Mmm-hmm.

35:45.200 --> 35:47.800
Oh, I thought he was a
rapist. I'm so relieved.

35:47.880 --> 35:49.480
You fuckin' weird.

35:56.840 --> 35:58.720
I need you to tell me
what time you were born.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.520
- I don't know.
- Tell me!

36:03.520 --> 36:04.480
11:42.

36:04.560 --> 36:06.320
- A.M. or P.M.?
- A.M.

36:06.400 --> 36:07.840
Where?

36:07.920 --> 36:09.240
Connecticut.

36:10.720 --> 36:11.800
Thank you.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.840
You know, it's surprising you're in prison.

36:19.640 --> 36:20.840
Oh, yeah?

36:20.920 --> 36:25.120
Typically, people in prison have
been led astray by a powerful force.

36:25.200 --> 36:27.320
That's not in your chart.

36:28.240 --> 36:30.360
Bears and water, but not prison.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.200
You're sure you gave me
all the right information?

36:32.280 --> 36:33.240
Positive.

36:33.320 --> 36:35.640
All right. Well, I gotta
re-examine this then

36:35.720 --> 36:38.640
because there's definitely some
shit in your first and 12th houses.

36:38.720 --> 36:40.920
Something askew in your formative years.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.760
Were you led astray by a powerful force?

36:45.400 --> 36:47.600
I bit my girlfriend's
tongue off and swallowed it.

36:47.680 --> 36:49.760
Well, that was the beginning of the fall.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.560
Pretty straightforward manic rage stuff.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.160
Makes sense. Aries rising.

36:56.280 --> 36:58.000
Excuse me. I don't mean
to be rude but I gotta go.

36:59.680 --> 37:01.200
I'm liking that hustle!

37:06.680 --> 37:08.000
Alex.

37:08.080 --> 37:09.200
Alex.

37:09.280 --> 37:10.320
Alex, what are you doing here?

37:10.400 --> 37:11.960
Were you there? Did you see us?

37:12.040 --> 37:13.320
She's dead.

37:14.040 --> 37:15.040
I killed her, didn't I?

37:15.120 --> 37:16.080
- She's dead.
- Whoa, whoa. What're you talk...

37:16.160 --> 37:17.960
- Killed who? What are you talking about?
- Pennsatucky.

37:18.040 --> 37:20.800
What? Pennsatucky's not dead.

37:20.880 --> 37:24.160
You fucked her up pretty good... but
that piece of shit is very much alive.

37:24.240 --> 37:25.440
You know that for sure?

37:25.520 --> 37:27.280
I work in the laundry.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.840
Everyday there's a fucking progress
report on  Tucky.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.880
Pipes, you are many things,

37:31.960 --> 37:33.280
murderess is not one of them.

37:33.360 --> 37:34.680
Oh, my God.

37:34.760 --> 37:35.720
I didn't kill her?

37:37.280 --> 37:38.240
I didn't kill her?

37:38.320 --> 37:39.680
Nope, congratulations.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.760
So, what are you doing here?

37:44.840 --> 37:45.800
What am I doing here?

37:47.440 --> 37:49.040
For the trial, dumbass.

37:49.120 --> 37:50.960
Trial? What fucking trial?

37:51.040 --> 37:53.360
Kubra's. He's been extradited.

37:57.760 --> 38:00.120
So that means that all
of this is only temporary?

38:02.000 --> 38:03.040
Oh, my God!

38:06.440 --> 38:08.720
Oh, my God, I'm so relieved.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.320
I mean, I knew.

38:12.160 --> 38:14.120
I knew I went a little
crazy while I was in the SHU,

38:14.200 --> 38:17.520
but, man, coming in here and
not knowing but thinking...

38:17.600 --> 38:20.360
I was really on the brink.

38:20.440 --> 38:21.640
You hate me.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.360
In all of this shit, I
forgot that you hate me.

38:24.440 --> 38:26.560
But you're talking to me.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.560
So does this mean you
don't hate me anymore?

38:28.640 --> 38:30.680
It means that I'm not
holding grudges today.

38:32.120 --> 38:33.600
I'm happy to see you.

38:35.600 --> 38:36.920
No touching!

38:38.760 --> 38:40.120
Ooh, Alex, get that!

38:40.200 --> 38:41.600
- What?
- Get that bug!

38:41.680 --> 38:43.680
Oh, it's a slow one and it's a big one.

38:43.760 --> 38:45.600
Alex, it's a biggie slow!

38:45.680 --> 38:47.320
Come on, it might be Yoda!

38:47.400 --> 38:48.680
Jesus Christ!

38:48.760 --> 38:50.600
The SHU really did do a number on you.

38:50.680 --> 38:51.760
All right. I owe my bunkie,

38:51.840 --> 38:54.520
who takes four shits a day,
yes, four, out in the open,

38:54.600 --> 38:57.720
I owe her a cigarette-toting roach
or she's gonna sic tattoo face on me.

38:59.320 --> 39:00.880
When is the trial?

39:02.240 --> 39:04.560
Now, I guess. They can
call us in any minute.

39:05.360 --> 39:06.320
Listen...

39:07.200 --> 39:08.640
we cannot say that we knew Kubra.

39:09.680 --> 39:10.880
What?

39:10.960 --> 39:12.960
Revenge is part of his
business model, okay?

39:13.040 --> 39:16.160
Sick, deep revenge. Disassociate.

39:16.240 --> 39:18.320
You never knew him. You
never fucking met him.

39:19.280 --> 39:21.640
That means lying under oath.

39:21.720 --> 39:24.400
Jesus, it is so hard to keep up
with what's black and white with you.

39:25.360 --> 39:27.440
Kubra is never going down for this.

39:27.520 --> 39:30.480
There is no justice, Piper.
Don't you know that by now?

39:32.000 --> 39:35.520
So we will lie to protect ourselves...

39:35.600 --> 39:37.760
or I will...

39:37.840 --> 39:38.920
and I hope you do, too.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.360
Did you know my dad cheats on my mom?

39:46.080 --> 39:47.840
No, how'd you know that?

39:48.600 --> 39:52.080
I saw him kiss another woman and
then they got in a car together.

39:53.680 --> 39:55.840
Yeah, he's pretty much a big hypocrite.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.440
Oh, big word.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.520
Just learned it.

39:59.440 --> 40:02.920
And then I told my mom
and she got mad at me!

40:03.000 --> 40:03.960
I got grounded.

40:04.040 --> 40:06.400
Well, now, if
you really think about it,

40:06.480 --> 40:09.520
could you imagine your mom
having any other reaction?

40:11.440 --> 40:13.280
- No, not really.
- Mmm.

40:14.960 --> 40:16.400
Are you saying I should've shut up?

40:16.480 --> 40:17.920
He's a cheater. That's wrong!

40:18.000 --> 40:20.080
Sometimes it's not a
matter of right and wrong.

40:20.160 --> 40:24.920
It's about making a choice that will
cause the least amount of pain to others,

40:25.000 --> 40:26.480
keeping things to yourself,

40:26.560 --> 40:28.880
sitting on information and feelings

40:28.960 --> 40:30.720
and living with your secrets.

40:32.640 --> 40:34.640
That sounds horrible.

40:34.720 --> 40:35.840
Oh, it is, dear.

40:35.920 --> 40:37.240
- Um, Grandma?
- Yes, Cal?

40:37.320 --> 40:39.920
I was trying to launch
Whiskers up into outer space

40:40.000 --> 40:41.640
and now my room is kind of on fire.

40:44.960 --> 40:46.160
Mmm!

40:47.120 --> 40:48.160
Wow...

40:49.560 --> 40:52.480
Decent coffee runs a close
second to what I miss most.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.400
Larry.

40:57.720 --> 40:59.160
Larry is what I miss most.

41:00.480 --> 41:01.440
Larry's a "who," not a "what."

41:02.360 --> 41:04.160
Look, Piper, I've come here as your lawyer

41:04.240 --> 41:07.120
and I think it's best if
we just stick to the case.

41:09.480 --> 41:11.640
How was Hanukkah?

41:11.720 --> 41:14.200
Is Aunt Joanie still with the talker?

41:15.760 --> 41:18.800
Forty-five minutes I heard about
diseased cows on dairy farms,

41:18.880 --> 41:23.240
the horrors of genetic engineering and
the overuse of antibiotics in cattle.

41:23.320 --> 41:25.800
Lesson being, he takes his coffee black.

41:29.480 --> 41:32.000
All right, Kubra Balik...

41:32.080 --> 41:34.160
the big jewel in your drug ring...

41:34.240 --> 41:36.160
was extradited from Europe to stand trial.

41:36.240 --> 41:38.320
Prosecution needs to
nail down his timeline,

41:38.400 --> 41:40.640
they're looking for
testimony that helps do that.

41:40.720 --> 41:42.880
Did you ever meet Kubra Balik?

41:44.280 --> 41:46.160
It was a confusing time.

41:48.080 --> 41:50.200
I... I'm sure, but my question
is pretty straightforward.

41:50.280 --> 41:51.720
Did you ever meet Kubra Balik?

41:54.000 --> 41:55.040
Yeah.

41:55.920 --> 41:57.280
Yes, I knew him.

41:58.440 --> 41:59.440
In what capacity?

41:59.520 --> 42:03.680
Were you aware of his role in the
ring? Did you hear him give orders?

42:03.760 --> 42:05.920
These are the questions the
prosecution's gonna be drilling you on

42:06.000 --> 42:07.040
before you testify.

42:07.120 --> 42:09.760
Yes, but what about my safety if I testify?

42:09.840 --> 42:12.280
This guy is the real deal.

42:12.360 --> 42:13.800
And from what I've seen on The Sopranos,

42:13.880 --> 42:16.720
these types do not take too kindly
to those that they consider traitors.

42:16.800 --> 42:20.720
They hire killers with underwear
fetishes to take them out.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.600
They've been working on
this case for five years,

42:23.680 --> 42:25.520
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars.

42:25.600 --> 42:26.760
And I'm sure you, for one,

42:26.840 --> 42:28.400
can attest to how little
the Feds like to spend money.

42:28.480 --> 42:29.440
Mmm.

42:29.520 --> 42:33.280
Mr. Balik is a very bad man who's
going away for a long, long time.

42:33.360 --> 42:35.560
Lying is not an option.

42:37.640 --> 42:39.520
Do you always tell the truth?

42:41.800 --> 42:44.320
Sometimes when they ask if I wanna
donate a dollar for heart disease,

42:44.400 --> 42:45.360
I'll say I already gave,

42:45.440 --> 42:48.040
but mostly, yes, I tell the truth.

42:48.120 --> 42:49.240
Hmm.

42:50.840 --> 42:55.320
Telling the truth wasn't much
of a priority in my family.

42:55.400 --> 42:58.440
You know, as long as everybody smiled
pretty for the Christmas picture,

42:58.520 --> 42:59.680
just...

43:00.880 --> 43:02.160
lie it up.

43:03.840 --> 43:06.880
I wouldn't carry on your
family tradition here.

43:06.960 --> 43:10.080
This is about crime and
punishment and justice.

43:10.160 --> 43:11.600
You need to tell the truth.

43:15.760 --> 43:18.000
Yes, of course.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.160
Good.

43:21.240 --> 43:23.160
Let's go meet the prosecutors.

43:24.240 --> 43:26.040
Can I bring my coffee?

43:32.360 --> 43:34.880
One and three quarters.

43:34.960 --> 43:36.560
- No good.
- This is bullshit.

43:36.640 --> 43:42.760
I got grilled all day and all night and
still... I brought back a bug for you.

43:42.840 --> 43:46.880
A prosecutor trapped that
between a file and a coffee cup

43:46.960 --> 43:49.440
and I carried it back in my bra.

43:51.800 --> 43:54.280
You guys are full of shit.

43:54.360 --> 43:56.880
There's no roach business.

43:56.960 --> 43:58.600
I'm done. Fuck you.

43:58.680 --> 44:00.440
We heard of what you
done back in Litchfield.

44:00.520 --> 44:02.120
Don't think that scares us any.

44:02.200 --> 44:03.160
That's right.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.720
You... one.

44:05.800 --> 44:06.800
Me?

44:08.080 --> 44:09.600
- Thirteen.
- Mmm.

44:12.080 --> 44:13.040
Chapman...

44:13.120 --> 44:14.720
you're going to court.

44:14.800 --> 44:18.320
Don't think this gets you off
the hook. We'll be waitin'.

44:22.440 --> 44:23.720
I don't know if I can do it.

44:25.920 --> 44:26.880
What?

44:26.960 --> 44:29.320
You know, my lawyer said Kubra's
going away no matter what.

44:29.400 --> 44:31.960
Did you not hear everything I said?

44:32.040 --> 44:34.920
When you told me that
nothing bad was gonna happen?

44:35.760 --> 44:37.280
How long have you been
holding onto that one?

44:40.680 --> 44:42.360
We have got to go in united on this.

44:43.720 --> 44:46.760
It'll be a red flag if you say
you knew him and I say I don't.

44:46.840 --> 44:48.080
They'll know that I'm lying.

44:48.160 --> 44:50.080
Maybe we should both just be honest.

44:50.160 --> 44:51.120
This is...

44:54.400 --> 44:56.720
This is not the time to
take some moral high ground.

44:57.520 --> 45:00.600
You know, I only seem to be faced
with these extreme moral choices

45:00.680 --> 45:01.960
when I am with you.

45:02.680 --> 45:03.760
Exciting, right?

45:06.680 --> 45:08.800
Look, I wish I could
do this all over again,

45:08.880 --> 45:10.560
but I can't, okay?

45:12.240 --> 45:14.640
This is the only way I
can keep you safe now.

45:14.720 --> 45:16.560
You have to do what I'm telling you.

45:17.920 --> 45:19.120
Or what?

45:20.120 --> 45:21.280
We're over?

45:21.360 --> 45:23.360
No.

45:23.440 --> 45:24.560
I wanna be your prison wife.

45:25.800 --> 45:27.040
I'm glad you can make jokes.

45:29.200 --> 45:30.760
Alex...

45:30.840 --> 45:34.240
I need to do the right thing for a change.

45:34.320 --> 45:35.320
I have to.

45:38.160 --> 45:39.960
And truthfully, you...

45:41.200 --> 45:44.120
you can't keep me safe either way.

45:47.600 --> 45:49.480
Left hand, please.

45:49.560 --> 45:50.960
Raise your right.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.000
Do you solemnly swear

45:52.080 --> 45:54.400
that you will tell the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth,

45:54.480 --> 45:56.240
- so help you God?
- I do.

45:57.600 --> 45:58.880
Thank you.

46:00.080 --> 46:01.120
All right, we can begin.

46:01.200 --> 46:03.360
Will you state your full
name for the court, please?

46:04.280 --> 46:06.720
Piper Elizabeth Chapman.

46:06.800 --> 46:07.880
Thank you.

46:07.960 --> 46:09.360
Miss Chapman...

46:09.440 --> 46:10.720
you are currently serving

46:10.800 --> 46:13.000
a 15-month sentence in
a federal penitentiary

46:13.080 --> 46:15.760
for crimes associated with Mr. Kubra Balik,

46:15.840 --> 46:17.320
is that correct?

46:17.400 --> 46:18.560
Yes, that's correct.

46:18.640 --> 46:21.120
And when were these crimes committed?

46:21.200 --> 46:24.000
Crime. It was just one crime.

46:24.080 --> 46:25.920
In 2003.

46:26.000 --> 46:26.960
Right.

46:27.040 --> 46:28.120
And can you explain to me

46:28.200 --> 46:31.600
how you came to be associated
with Mr. Balik's drug ring?

46:33.400 --> 46:36.640
My girlfriend at the time... Alex.

46:36.720 --> 46:38.720
Is that Miss Alex Vause?

46:38.800 --> 46:39.840
Yes.

46:39.920 --> 46:41.920
Are you two still a couple?

46:43.440 --> 46:44.400
No.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.560
But in 2003...

46:47.640 --> 46:49.720
how would you describe the relationship?

46:51.280 --> 46:52.880
We were together.

46:55.000 --> 46:58.880
She was... the love of my life.

46:59.600 --> 47:03.280
And was it Miss Vause who
introduced you to Mr. Balik?

47:06.160 --> 47:07.400
I don't recall.

47:08.240 --> 47:09.360
I see.

47:10.800 --> 47:12.880
Someone else made the introduction?

47:13.680 --> 47:15.320
I don't recall.

47:18.120 --> 47:21.200
Are you saying you never met Mr. Balik?

47:22.640 --> 47:24.800
Not that I can recall.

47:27.280 --> 47:31.280
Miss Chapman, your
girlfriend... Miss Vause...

47:32.160 --> 47:34.440
was one of Mr. Balik's
most profitable traffickers.

47:34.520 --> 47:35.800
Were you aware of that?

47:37.680 --> 47:39.560
We didn't discuss her business much.

47:41.200 --> 47:43.040
But you must've been aware of her success.

47:43.120 --> 47:49.120
You... you traveled together to Bali,
Brussels, Paris, Turkey, Greece...

47:49.200 --> 47:50.800
all in the span of one year.

47:51.800 --> 47:53.440
We traveled a lot.

47:53.520 --> 47:59.000
And never in that time did she
introduce you to her boss, Kubra Balik?

48:02.120 --> 48:03.480
Not that I can recall.

48:08.400 --> 48:09.840
Miss Chapman...

48:10.920 --> 48:16.200
you are aware of the
consequences of lying under oath?

48:16.280 --> 48:17.760
Yes, of course.

48:17.840 --> 48:20.120
And your responses remain the same?

48:21.040 --> 48:22.760
I was there for Alex.

48:24.400 --> 48:26.680
She was what I paid attention to...

48:27.920 --> 48:29.800
who I paid attention to.

48:31.600 --> 48:33.600
Everything else was just...

48:35.120 --> 48:37.200
background.

48:42.160 --> 48:44.880
I'm sorry that I can't help you more.

48:44.960 --> 48:48.560
Prosecution has completed
examination with this witness.

49:00.920 --> 49:05.000
Since I'm not a half-wit like my son,

49:05.080 --> 49:07.520
I don't have to bother
asking why you did that.

49:07.600 --> 49:10.480
I guess the possibility of...

49:10.560 --> 49:13.960
added time or...
resentencing on new charges

49:14.040 --> 49:15.720
just isn't that big a deal for you.

49:17.120 --> 49:18.920
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.120
Disappointed me?

49:21.200 --> 49:23.680
You broke the law... again.

49:25.320 --> 49:29.080
I made a decision that I
don't expect you to understand.

49:30.280 --> 49:31.560
Well, I'm done.

49:32.640 --> 49:34.000
You live on this slippery slope, kid,

49:34.080 --> 49:37.280
and for some reason, you can't
seem to stop doing rain dances.

49:37.360 --> 49:38.920
Good luck, honey.

49:43.360 --> 49:44.640
Vause, you let me
down. You were a letdown.

49:44.720 --> 49:46.400
It was 3:00 a.m.

49:46.480 --> 49:49.160
I think that anything
after 2:00, it's like...

49:49.240 --> 49:50.880
you're not bailing, you're just tired.

49:50.960 --> 49:53.120
But you missed the live sex show.

49:53.200 --> 49:54.160
And the flamingos.

49:54.240 --> 49:56.960
Oh, the flamingos! That's right!

49:57.040 --> 49:58.400
There were flamingos.

49:58.480 --> 50:00.960
- Kubra had a front row seat to both.
- Uh-huh.

50:01.040 --> 50:02.400
So much pink.

50:12.440 --> 50:14.720
I think it's time for me to go call my dad.

50:14.800 --> 50:16.640
Oh, tell Bill I said, "Happy birthday."

50:16.720 --> 50:18.720
You don't exist, remember?

50:18.800 --> 50:21.440
That's right. I'm the invisible woman.

50:21.520 --> 50:24.880
Maybe I should switch careers and
become a jewel thief.

50:26.160 --> 50:27.360
Steal me something good.

50:32.320 --> 50:33.600
Yes, all good.

50:33.680 --> 50:35.840
But what about you? How was your day?

50:35.920 --> 50:39.400
Oh, it was nice. Nothing crazy.
Mom and I went out to dinner.

50:39.480 --> 50:41.000
How about you? You're still in Barcelona?

50:42.240 --> 50:43.600
No, we're in Paris now.

50:43.680 --> 50:45.280
Oh, that's exciting, honey!

50:45.360 --> 50:47.840
But please tell me you're
not staying in youth hostels.

50:47.920 --> 50:49.840
- I'm happy to wire you money.
- Don't worry.

50:49.920 --> 50:52.160
Polly has relatives here and
they're letting us stay with them.

50:52.240 --> 50:55.520
It's... beautiful and it's safe.

50:55.600 --> 50:57.400
It's on the Right Bank.

50:58.280 --> 50:59.280
Better than the wrong bank.

51:00.120 --> 51:01.520
Ha-ha, Dad.

51:01.600 --> 51:04.920
So you're loving it?
You girls getting along?

51:05.000 --> 51:06.600
Well, I mean, you know how Polly is.

51:06.680 --> 51:09.560
Yesterday she had us scheduled
from morning until midnight.

51:09.640 --> 51:12.000
You know if it's late, you
need to take a taxi, right?

51:12.080 --> 51:13.920
Yes...

51:14.000 --> 51:16.320
and always walk on the
well-lit side of the street

51:16.400 --> 51:20.200
and hold onto my wallet and don't
jump out of the back of buses.

51:20.280 --> 51:23.440
You taught me everything, Dad.

51:23.520 --> 51:25.200
You're a good girl.

51:26.560 --> 51:28.600
Thanks, Dad.

51:28.680 --> 51:30.000
I gotta go.

51:31.160 --> 51:32.880
Happy birthday, Daddy.

51:32.960 --> 51:35.560
Thanks, baby. Thanks for calling.

51:45.200 --> 51:46.280
Alex!

51:48.240 --> 51:49.440
Alex, I did what you said.

51:49.520 --> 51:51.440
Listen, Piper.

51:51.520 --> 51:53.640
Everything just happened so fast.

51:53.720 --> 51:54.960
What's going on?

51:55.960 --> 51:57.040
I had to tell the truth.

51:58.960 --> 52:00.800
- My lawyer said that...
- Are you kidding?

52:00.880 --> 52:02.880
- Piper, you don't understand.
- Are you...

52:02.960 --> 52:03.920
Are you fucking kidding me?

52:04.000 --> 52:05.440
Where are you going? Are you getting out?

52:05.520 --> 52:06.600
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, Piper.

52:06.680 --> 52:08.320
- I'll write you. I need to explain.
- You're getting out?

52:08.400 --> 52:09.600
Wait, what?

52:09.680 --> 52:11.880
What the fuck did you do, Alex?

52:11.960 --> 52:15.200
What the fuck did you do?

52:15.280 --> 52:16.480
Fuck you, Alex!

52:16.560 --> 52:17.760
Fuck you!

52:32.440 --> 52:37.240
