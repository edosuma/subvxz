WEBVTT

00:11.236 --> 00:13.534
Killer view.

00:14.239 --> 00:17.731
Good morning, Mr. Rickman.
Thank you for coming in.

00:17.910 --> 00:22.108
So, what can I do for
the Center for Environmental Protection?

00:22.581 --> 00:25.414
I heard your people were in Smallville
doing some surveying.

00:25.584 --> 00:29.042
I wanted to discuss your intentions.

00:29.922 --> 00:31.753
My intentions are to build a new plant.

00:35.027 --> 00:36.289
What's this?

00:36.462 --> 00:39.625
Ground water from the last town
where you built a plant.

00:39.798 --> 00:42.198
Well, I find that very hard to believe.

00:42.367 --> 00:46.201
Rickman Industries has always had a very
good relationship with the CEP, Paul.

00:47.873 --> 00:49.898
- Can I call you Paul?
- No.

00:50.075 --> 00:54.205
Tomorrow I'll have a restraining order
preventing you from moving into Smallville...

00:54.379 --> 00:57.871
...until every case against you is settled.

00:59.218 --> 01:02.881
It's too bad. I-
Well, I have my mind set on Smallville.

01:03.055 --> 01:07.617
This town has a special place in my heart.

01:08.460 --> 01:11.395
I don't suppose there's anything
I could do to change your mind.

01:11.563 --> 01:15.966
I'm afraid I'm not as easy to buy off
as my colleagues.

01:18.237 --> 01:20.797
I've never bought off a soul in my life.

01:20.973 --> 01:22.736
People listen to me because I'm right.

01:22.908 --> 01:24.773
When they do, they end up better for it.

01:24.943 --> 01:27.810
Tell that to the 96 cases
of vinyl chloride poisoning...

01:27.980 --> 01:31.472
...I've tied to your pesticide plants.

01:35.420 --> 01:39.982
Well, I see there's little else to do.

01:40.826 --> 01:43.761
Just want to tell you how much
I appreciate your candor.

01:44.263 --> 01:46.356
I wish you luck.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074

01:55.507 --> 01:59.375
Now, listen, Paul-
I can call you Paul, can't I?

02:02.614 --> 02:04.445
I guess.

02:04.850 --> 02:10.186
Now, you strike me
as a man of passion, Paul.

02:10.354 --> 02:13.119
Passion hurts, doesn't it?

02:13.358 --> 02:17.954
People don't understand. They don't see
how you devote yourself to what's right.

02:19.631 --> 02:21.155
I bet you're afraid.

02:21.533 --> 02:25.094
You give all that passion
to a job no one even cares about.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.033
No.

02:30.876 --> 02:32.309
- Yes.
- Yes.

02:36.882 --> 02:39.817
Look at that world out there, Paul.

02:40.219 --> 02:42.983
Is any part of it yours?

02:45.190 --> 02:47.215
No.

02:47.559 --> 02:52.223
All that pain you feel,
there's only one way to make it stop.

03:19.758 --> 03:21.589
Going down?

03:30.869 --> 03:33.030
Thanks.

03:42.381 --> 03:45.873
Tyler, bring the car around.
We're going to Smallville.

04:38.136 --> 04:41.071
Okay, here we go.

04:41.806 --> 04:44.741
I thought learning to drive
my dad's Volvo was difficult...

04:44.909 --> 04:47.139
...but at least the car had
windshield wipers.

04:47.312 --> 04:50.679
- Chloe, you're doing fine for your first time.
- No, no, we're turning.

04:51.916 --> 04:53.247
So how's Whitney holding up?

04:53.418 --> 04:57.252
His dad's still in the hospital, so he's
been working extra shifts at the store.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.322
It's tough running a family business.

04:59.491 --> 05:03.587
He secretly wants his dad to sell it.
He doesn't want it when he graduates.

05:03.762 --> 05:07.323
I don't blame him. I don't see myself
being a farmer when I grow up.

05:07.499 --> 05:10.161
- Well, what do you want to do?
- I'm not sure...

05:10.335 --> 05:14.271
...as long as it doesn't involve putting
on a suit and doing a lot of flying.

05:16.007 --> 05:18.840
I dropped my camera.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.344
What'd you bring that thing for anyway?

05:21.513 --> 05:24.175
I'm not out here doing
this butt-bashing thing for fun.

05:24.349 --> 05:27.113
These woods are like the Bermuda Triangle
of Smallville.

05:27.819 --> 05:29.787
People come in here,
and when they leave...

05:29.954 --> 05:34.288
...they can't remember a thing. There've
been dozens of incidents the past 10 years.

05:34.459 --> 05:38.122
- I'll go get you your camera.
- Thank you.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.700
The stories in these woods
go back to the Civil War.

05:44.869 --> 05:47.133
No, what I'm talking about
happened a week ago.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.830
Surveyors from Rickman Industries
came out screaming...

05:50.008 --> 05:52.875
- ... and can't remember what happened.
- I'm sure you have a theory.

05:53.211 --> 05:56.044
- Kyle Tippett.
- The guy who sells weird sculptures in town?

05:56.214 --> 05:59.513
Don't you think it's odd that he lives
all alone out here in the woods?

05:59.751 --> 06:00.740
Thoreau did.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.245
Yeah, Clark, so did the Unabomber.

06:05.657 --> 06:06.681
Lana.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.983
- Stay with the horses.
- Okay.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.925
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, okay.

06:13.098 --> 06:14.827
Easy, easy.

06:34.719 --> 06:36.687
Get away from her!

06:38.022 --> 06:41.856
- You okay?
- Yeah, it's okay. I'm fine.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.780
What do you think happened, son?

07:03.948 --> 07:08.078
I don't know, but it just doesn't look
like he's trying to hurt her.

07:10.288 --> 07:13.780
- Okay, Nell. Thanks. Bye.
- How's Lana?

07:13.958 --> 07:16.256
A mild concussion.
Other than that, she's fine.

07:16.427 --> 07:18.895
- And Nell?
- That's a different story.

07:19.063 --> 07:22.226
She wants Clark to go to the police
and say he saw Kyle...

07:22.400 --> 07:25.062
- ... spook Lana's horse and attack her.
- I didn't see that.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.431
I don't think we've heard the end of this.

07:28.072 --> 07:30.802
Did Kyle seem at all dangerous to you?

07:30.975 --> 07:34.604
He seemed scared.

07:34.779 --> 07:37.407
Chloe said some surveyors
were spooked last week...

07:37.582 --> 07:39.743
...and now us.
I wonder if there's a connection.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.250
Jonathan, go talk to Kyle.
Get this cleared up.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.183
- Yeah.
- No, I'll go.

07:44.355 --> 07:47.324
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- It's not like he can hurt me.

07:47.826 --> 07:49.350
That is not the point.

07:49.994 --> 07:54.829
Dad, I understand what it's like
to be hidden from the world.

07:54.999 --> 07:57.160
Give me a shot.

07:59.771 --> 08:03.434
- Do you know where Kyle lives?
- I just follow the trail of bad sculptures.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.945
Miss Hardwick, I'm surprised
to find you in Smallville.

08:15.119 --> 08:16.518
It grows on you after a while.

08:16.688 --> 08:19.020
Don't encourage him, Victoria.

08:19.524 --> 08:21.958
It's funny. I was just saying
what this town needs...

08:22.126 --> 08:24.526
...is more pesticides in the water supply.

08:24.696 --> 08:27.893
Now, don't tell me you mind
someone else sharing your little sandbox.

08:28.066 --> 08:30.967
Only when they're polluting it.
Hello, Bob.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.966
Lex?

08:34.472 --> 08:37.304
I'll leave you boys alone.

08:39.977 --> 08:43.539
Photos are a bit over the top,
but I like what you've done with the place.

08:43.715 --> 08:46.149
Oh, it's only temporary.

08:46.885 --> 08:49.046
Here, have a button.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.387
Enough of these, and they won't notice...

08:51.556 --> 08:54.992
- ... you're rendering the town uninhabitable.
- I'm just like you, Lex.

08:55.159 --> 08:58.322
A government employee sets
my emissions levels, and I abide.

08:58.496 --> 08:59.724
Do you have an objection?

08:59.898 --> 09:03.231
Let's call it an interest.
Smallville's my home now.

09:03.401 --> 09:07.497
That's right. Yes, Lionel had mentioned
that he'd exiled you here.

09:07.672 --> 09:11.005
- Had dinner with him a couple weeks ago.
- Yeah? What happened?

09:11.175 --> 09:14.076
Somebody more important cancel on him?

09:15.179 --> 09:19.513
Don't worry, Lex, I'll keep my concerns
away from the Luthors.

09:19.684 --> 09:24.678
I found the perfect place for the plant.
It's out of the way, it's near the river.

09:24.856 --> 09:27.017
The Kent farm?

09:27.358 --> 09:29.258
I assume you've approached them.

09:29.427 --> 09:30.621
It's just a formality.

09:30.929 --> 09:35.593
The way licenses and zoning permits
always seem to be a formality for you, Bob.

09:35.767 --> 09:40.534
I know the Kents, and not even you
can convince them to sell that farm.

09:41.539 --> 09:44.201
You'd be surprised.

09:44.609 --> 09:47.635
Trust me, Bob, you're not that charming.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.407
You're trespassing.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.143
How'd you do that?

10:29.320 --> 10:33.814
Magic. Haven't you heard of Crazy Kyle
who lives in the woods by himself?

10:33.992 --> 10:38.656
He's somewhere between Bigfoot
and the Blair Witch.

10:39.163 --> 10:43.065
- I'm-
- Clark Kent, Jonathan and Martha's son.

10:43.234 --> 10:44.496
How'd you know?

10:44.669 --> 10:47.604
I live in a trailer, not a cave.

10:50.808 --> 10:53.504
I wanted to talk to you about
what happened this afternoon.

10:53.678 --> 10:54.940
You mean the girl?

10:55.113 --> 10:57.775
The horse threw her,
and I made sure she was breathing.

10:57.949 --> 11:01.441
So you don't make a habit
of scaring people out of the woods...

11:01.619 --> 11:03.314
...and spooking their horses?

11:04.455 --> 11:08.016
If I wanted to explain myself all the time,
I'd get a job.

11:08.192 --> 11:12.856
But I left that world behind for a reason.
Goodbye.

11:14.198 --> 11:15.961
Why are you so unfriendly?

11:16.134 --> 11:19.126
- Because I'm not interested in friends.
- Everyone needs a friend.

11:19.370 --> 11:21.463
No, they don't...

11:22.373 --> 11:24.705
...because they'll always betray you
in the end.

11:34.619 --> 11:35.881
How are you feeling?

11:36.054 --> 11:38.386
Better, thanks.

11:39.390 --> 11:42.484
Nell said you're going to talk to the police.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.185
Actually, I went out and spoke to Kyle.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.358
You talked to that psycho?

11:49.667 --> 11:51.567
Yeah.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.870
He said he was making sure
Lana was okay.

11:56.407 --> 11:59.001
- Do you believe him?
- Yeah, I think I do.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.509
If I were there,
I would have done something.

12:07.085 --> 12:09.246
- Do you remember anything?
- Not really.

12:11.255 --> 12:14.088
I gotta get home. I'm glad you're okay.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.695
That looked uncomfortable.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.960
Listen, has Bob Rickman been by the farm?

12:25.369 --> 12:28.702
- Why would he be interested in us?
- He's interested in buying your land.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.434
You have met my dad.
Why are you even worried?

12:32.610 --> 12:36.706
I've seen Rickman talk people out
of house and home. He's a locust, Clark.

12:36.881 --> 12:40.214
He tears through a community
and betrays anyone who trusts him.

12:40.384 --> 12:43.046
Tell your dad to be careful.

12:44.455 --> 12:45.979
Okay.

12:49.127 --> 12:52.392
Hello, Kyle.
Wondering when you'd stop by.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.292
We had an agreement.

12:54.465 --> 12:58.401
You do whatever you want with the rest
of the world, but leave this town alone.

12:58.569 --> 13:02.130
Well, we made those rules a long time
ago. The world's changed, Kyle.

13:02.406 --> 13:06.069
Maybe it's time the public knew
the whole truth about Bob Rickman.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.510
The public believes whatever I tell them.

13:10.681 --> 13:13.741
I spent nine years honing my skill
while you hid in the woods...

13:13.918 --> 13:15.943
...because you were afraid.

13:17.655 --> 13:21.318
Take my hand. See how afraid I am.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.264
You've been warned.

13:43.014 --> 13:44.948
Kyle, what are you doing here?

13:45.116 --> 13:47.311
I just registered a complaint.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.515
What do you have against Rickman?

13:50.688 --> 13:53.555
There used to be a time when people
minded their own business.

13:53.724 --> 13:55.521
Hey, Tippett!

13:55.693 --> 13:57.456
- And what's your problem?
- You are.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.960
Touch Lana Lang again,
and I'll take care of you.

14:00.131 --> 14:03.862
- Whitney, back off.
- I've got my eye on you.

14:04.969 --> 14:07.631
- That's why I don't come into town.
- You want a ride home?

14:07.805 --> 14:09.067
Why are you being so nice?

14:09.307 --> 14:12.071
You're not a bad guy.
You're just not a people person.

14:12.543 --> 14:15.103
- What gave that away?
- You want a ride or not?

14:15.279 --> 14:17.144
Yeah, I gotta stop and get groceries.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.374
No problem.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.483
Excuse me.

14:26.390 --> 14:30.383
I'm sorry, I couldn't help overhearing. Are
you having a problem with Kyle Tippett?

14:30.561 --> 14:32.153
Yeah, he attacked my girlfriend.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.991
Bob Rickman.

14:35.499 --> 14:36.693
Maybe I can help.

14:44.642 --> 14:46.667
Thanks for the ride,
I really appreciate it.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.677
Next time, don't talk my ear off.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.680
Hey, why were you at Rickman's?

14:52.850 --> 14:54.681
Why were you at Rickman's?

14:54.852 --> 14:57.082
I heard a rumor he was trying
to buy our farm.

14:57.255 --> 14:59.689
Stay away from him.

15:00.258 --> 15:03.193
Do you miss it? Regular life, I mean?

15:05.196 --> 15:08.688
Some people weren't meant to have
a regular life, Clark.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.600
Thanks.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.364
Bye.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.393
Whitney.

16:39.523 --> 16:42.287
They're booking Kyle for assault.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.455
All right, what happened, guys?

16:45.629 --> 16:50.032
I saw Kyle in town. He blew me off,
so I came out here to talk.

16:50.201 --> 16:52.465
You drove out here in the middle
of the night?

16:52.970 --> 16:57.270
Yeah. I had a feeling
he was gonna attack Lana again.

16:57.441 --> 16:59.875
Next thing I know,
he attacks me with a bat.

17:00.044 --> 17:02.035
Is that what happened?

17:02.213 --> 17:04.443
I did see Kyle swing at Whitney, but...

17:05.316 --> 17:07.307
But what?

17:08.051 --> 17:10.816
Kyle says Whitney swung at him first.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.648
That's crazy. Why would I do that?

17:12.823 --> 17:15.290
I don't know. None of this
makes any sense.

17:15.459 --> 17:19.259
Yes, it does. First he attacks Lana,
then he comes after me.

17:19.463 --> 17:22.489
- The guy needs to be locked up!
- We've all had a rough night.

17:22.665 --> 17:25.066
- Just calm down.
- You saw it with your own eyes.

17:25.236 --> 17:29.400
That freak tried to kill me!
Now you're saying it's my fault?

17:41.018 --> 17:45.250
He's been a hermit for years, and suddenly
he's one of Smallville's most wanted.

17:45.423 --> 17:48.722
- Something must have made him snap.
- I think it's Bob Rickman.

17:48.893 --> 17:51.589
Yeah, but what does our rural Rodin
have against Rickman...

17:51.762 --> 17:54.526
...other than the obvious
poisoning-the-environment angle?

17:54.698 --> 17:57.929
I don't know. Could you do some digging,
find a connection?

17:58.102 --> 18:01.435
Yeah, absolutely.
Sounds like an interesting story.

18:01.605 --> 18:04.165
Tree-hugging hermit versus
pesticide tycoon.

18:06.444 --> 18:10.175
- What do you think they have in common?
- Definitely not their grooming habits.

18:11.916 --> 18:13.941
Lana.

18:15.719 --> 18:16.981
Hey, what's wrong?

18:17.455 --> 18:19.616
Can you give us a minute?

18:19.790 --> 18:21.883
Yeah.

18:25.796 --> 18:29.129
Whitney said you accused him
of attacking Kyle.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.325
I didn't accuse him.
I have some questions.

18:31.569 --> 18:33.560
- Like what?
- Like why was he there?

18:33.737 --> 18:35.705
He was just trying to talk to him.

18:35.873 --> 18:38.205
We both know Whitney can be
a little overzealous...

18:38.375 --> 18:40.809
...but his heart's in the right place.

18:40.978 --> 18:43.970
I just don't think Kyle would do that.
He doesn't seem violent.

18:44.315 --> 18:46.374
You can tell from knowing him
for two days?

18:46.984 --> 18:49.748
He's lived in the woods alone for 10 years.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.081
But that makes him odd, not dangerous.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.224
Whitney wouldn't attack anybody.

18:54.492 --> 18:56.255
He strung me up in a field.

18:59.497 --> 19:03.024
So that's what this is about?
You haven't forgiven him.

19:04.335 --> 19:07.327
Lana, I just think there's
something else going on here.

19:07.505 --> 19:11.032
Yeah, there is. You're looking for
an excuse to knock Whitney.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.570
You know what he's going through
right now with his dad.

19:15.112 --> 19:19.674
If you don't like him, just say it.
Don't pretend to be his friend.

19:38.636 --> 19:41.298
You know, a barn's no place
for shoes like that.

19:41.472 --> 19:43.440
Didn't like them that much anyway.

19:43.874 --> 19:45.967
Bob Rickman, Rickman Industries.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.202
I know who you are.

19:51.048 --> 19:52.572
You probably know why I'm here.

19:53.050 --> 19:58.078
I hear you're interested in this farm,
and you're a very persuasive fellow.

19:58.255 --> 20:02.248
I gotta tell you, there's not a snowball's
chance in hell I'd consider selling...

20:02.426 --> 20:05.054
...especially not to Rickman Industries.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.888
You got a problem with progress?

20:08.065 --> 20:11.660
I'm skeptical about anybody who thinks
they can solve my problems with money.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.393
Why is that?

20:13.571 --> 20:18.099
Well, because if I was interested
in money, I wouldn't be a farmer, would I?

20:18.275 --> 20:20.505
If you'll excuse me, I got
some real work to do.

20:31.255 --> 20:35.351
- What happened? You all right?
- Oh, I think I twisted my ankle.

20:36.427 --> 20:39.260
I guess you were right about these shoes.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.927
Could you give me a hand?

21:20.237 --> 21:23.673
Now, are you sure I can't convince you
to change your mind?

21:25.609 --> 21:29.978
How could you do this without telling me?
What happened to "This land is our legacy"?

21:30.147 --> 21:34.083
- What's going on, guys?
- Your father sold the farm to Bob Rickman.

21:34.318 --> 21:37.412
What? How?

21:37.588 --> 21:41.684
One minute I'm telling him he doesn't stand
a chance. The next, I got a signed contract.

21:41.859 --> 21:45.590
I called our lawyer. He said he can't do
anything until he sees the contract...

21:45.763 --> 21:49.164
...but the devil-made-me-do-it argument
wouldn't hold up in court.

21:49.333 --> 21:51.824
- Just can't believe I did this.
- What did Rickman do?

21:52.169 --> 21:54.433
He made his case, he shook my hand.
That was it.

21:54.605 --> 21:58.006
- It can't be that easy.
- How else do you explain my signature?

22:01.278 --> 22:03.109
- I know someone who can help.
- No!

22:03.514 --> 22:05.675
I will not owe Lex Luthor anything,
thank you.

22:05.849 --> 22:09.012
Right now, you don't have
anything to owe.

22:19.463 --> 22:22.455
So, what time are you working
at the store tomorrow?

22:28.972 --> 22:32.135
Ouch. What's that all about?

22:32.309 --> 22:35.836
I won't cave on my opinion of Kyle Tippett.
It put me on the outs with Lana.

22:36.146 --> 22:38.410
So you're Atticus.

22:38.582 --> 22:40.812
<i>Atticus Finch, To Kill a Mockingbird?</i>

22:40.984 --> 22:42.975
- Never read it.
- You should.

22:43.153 --> 22:46.816
You two have a lot in common.
Small-town heroes, believe in the truth...

22:46.990 --> 22:48.981
...not willing to back down.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.490
How's it end?

22:50.661 --> 22:53.824
It's not about the ending.
It's about the journey.

22:57.668 --> 23:01.297
What kills me is that I know I'm right.
I just wish I could get them to see it.

23:01.572 --> 23:03.904
That, my friend, is the key to leadership...

23:04.074 --> 23:06.338
...knowing you're right
and convincing everyone.

23:06.510 --> 23:09.172
If you can do that, the world's your oyster.

23:09.346 --> 23:12.008
Right now, I'd settle for getting
our farm back.

23:12.182 --> 23:15.674
The good news is,
the deal's three times market value.

23:15.853 --> 23:19.812
The bad news is, it's ironclad,
meaning it'll take a dozen extra lawyers.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.348
Fortunately, I've got an army of them.

23:23.827 --> 23:26.295
For once I think my parents will be glad
for your help.

23:26.663 --> 23:29.154
I wonder what Rickman said
to convince your father.

23:29.333 --> 23:32.825
I know the farm's in debt, but he'll pave
it and turn it into a wasteland...

23:33.003 --> 23:34.868
...hardly better than the offers I made.

23:35.038 --> 23:37.598
I just know my father
would never sell the farm.

23:37.775 --> 23:41.267
Except that he did. Rickman's known
for getting past people's defenses...

23:41.445 --> 23:45.541
...but that's just good business. Unless
you think there's more to it than that.

23:52.189 --> 23:53.383
Where are you going?

23:53.557 --> 23:54.785
Jail.

24:00.063 --> 24:02.964
Got a call you had a problem,
Mr. Rickman.

24:03.133 --> 24:06.398
Yes, thank you for coming by, deputy.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.796
No problem.

24:12.409 --> 24:15.810
I need you to take care of an old friend.

24:26.824 --> 24:31.591
Let's go, on your feet.
You have a visitor here.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.602
Kyle!

24:55.018 --> 24:56.042
No!

25:40.930 --> 25:42.591
How bad?

25:42.765 --> 25:47.702
It's no worse than when Ozzy snorted
that row of fire ants down in Queensland.

25:48.771 --> 25:50.238
Is this guy really a doctor?

25:50.873 --> 25:54.604
He was. Now he's more
of an on-call specialist.

25:54.777 --> 25:57.803
You know, actors, rock stars,
billionaires' sons.

25:58.214 --> 26:00.148
- How do you know him?
- Long story.

26:00.316 --> 26:02.716
What's a guy gotta do
to get a drink around here?

26:02.885 --> 26:04.716
Finish sewing.

26:04.887 --> 26:09.051
Don't worry, Toby appreciates discretion.
Nobody will ever know Kyle was here.

26:09.225 --> 26:10.385
Thanks.

26:10.560 --> 26:13.825
I'm curious, why did you think
I'd be willing to harbor a fugitive?

26:14.397 --> 26:18.891
My parents would freak, and if I took him
to a hospital, they'd put him back in jail.

26:19.068 --> 26:20.660
You're the only one I could trust.

26:20.837 --> 26:24.568
All in all, it's easier
than that knife wound of yours.

26:25.241 --> 26:29.507
Club Zero, remember that?
Blood all over my Mustang.

26:30.913 --> 26:34.974
- Can we talk to him now?
- I gave him something for the pain.

26:35.151 --> 26:37.915
It's lights out until the morning.

26:38.921 --> 26:40.980
My usual payment?

26:42.325 --> 26:45.158
Brown bag on my desk.

26:46.729 --> 26:50.426
- See you, Toby.
- Lex.

26:50.767 --> 26:52.598
You'd better get home. It's late.

26:56.606 --> 27:00.337
Hey, Atticus, you may want
to change your shirt.

27:24.133 --> 27:25.464
Hi, Clark.

27:25.635 --> 27:28.798
You're the last person I expected
to find here.

27:29.205 --> 27:31.799
I heard Kyle Tippett escaped.
I was a little freaked out.

27:32.375 --> 27:33.967
He's not coming after anybody.

27:34.644 --> 27:37.010
- How do you know?
- I just do.

27:39.816 --> 27:41.545
I'm sorry I bothered you.

27:41.884 --> 27:45.980
If you were worried, why did you walk
all the way over here instead of calling?

27:47.557 --> 27:50.492
I don't know. I thought you
might've changed your opinion.

27:50.660 --> 27:53.652
Well, if you came over for an apology,
you're out of luck.

27:53.830 --> 27:58.267
Clark, he escaped from jail.
You have to admit it looks pretty bad.

27:58.434 --> 28:01.767
- You don't know the whole story.
- Then tell me. What is it?

28:02.171 --> 28:06.164
I don't know yet. You've already made up
your mind about him, so what do you care?

28:07.243 --> 28:11.077
I wanted to clear the air
and preserve our friendship...

28:11.247 --> 28:14.182
...but now I don't even know
why I bothered.

28:21.824 --> 28:23.348
Here you go.

28:23.526 --> 28:25.426
Thank you.

28:27.597 --> 28:29.758
Hello, Lex.

28:34.036 --> 28:37.028
<i>Oh, come on, Lex,
this Art of War stuff is for amateurs.</i>

28:37.273 --> 28:39.867
It's not that. I just don't like you.

28:45.615 --> 28:49.449
So my attorney tells me that my purchase
of the Kent farm is being challenged.

28:49.619 --> 28:53.214
I warned you the Kents were
a tough nut to crack.

28:55.057 --> 28:59.619
I recognize LuthorCorp lawyers
when I see them. Why are you involved?

28:59.796 --> 29:03.288
Smallville's my home,
and the Kents are my friends.

29:07.737 --> 29:10.297
Well, with friends like you, Lex...

29:14.577 --> 29:16.977
Don't touch me.

29:18.581 --> 29:21.948
Speaking of old friends,
I heard Kyle Tippett escaped from jail.

29:23.419 --> 29:25.410
Now, why do you assume
we're old friends?

29:26.088 --> 29:27.453
Just a rumor.

29:28.257 --> 29:29.485
Have you seen him?

29:29.926 --> 29:34.158
I never met the man, but I'll be sure
to pass on your regards when I do.

29:39.001 --> 29:41.936
How'd you get my dad
to sign that contract?

29:42.104 --> 29:44.334
Oh, you must be the Kent boy.

29:44.507 --> 29:48.034
I'm a good businessman.
No hard feelings?

30:12.602 --> 30:16.299
I spent the morning delving into
the exotic world of agriculture equipment...

30:16.472 --> 30:19.498
...and it seems that Kyle and Rickman
were partners in the '80s.

30:19.675 --> 30:21.336
- They sold farm equipment?
- Yeah...

30:21.510 --> 30:24.775
...they were salesmen of the year
three years running, '89, '90, '91.

30:24.947 --> 30:28.246
<i>The next year, Rickman started
his own company, and Kyle went Walden.</i>

30:28.718 --> 30:30.583
- I wonder what happened?
- I don't know...

30:30.753 --> 30:33.221
<i>...but I found this story
in the Smallville Ledger.</i>

30:33.389 --> 30:35.152
"Salesmen trapped in car
after meteor shower."

30:35.324 --> 30:39.055
I'm guessing whatever's going on started
that sunny October day, 12 years ago.

30:39.829 --> 30:42.229
- Let's go ask him.
- Wait, you know where he is?

30:53.676 --> 30:54.768
Where's Kyle?

30:55.578 --> 30:57.512
Who?

30:58.681 --> 31:01.514
I think I know where he went.

31:15.197 --> 31:17.256
I appreciate the help,
but I'm done here.

31:17.433 --> 31:20.197
- We know Rickman was your partner.
- It was a million years ago.

31:20.369 --> 31:22.701
What happened to you guys
in that meteor shower?

31:22.872 --> 31:26.273
Trust me, you're not the only ones
that were affected by it.

31:26.442 --> 31:30.276
What's going on with you and Rickman?
How did he get my dad to sell our farm?

31:33.382 --> 31:37.716
You know, until that day, we were the
worst salesmen to ever carry a catalog.

31:37.887 --> 31:40.481
All that changed after they
pulled us out of that car.

31:40.656 --> 31:44.183
With a handshake we could get people
to do whatever we wanted them to do...

31:44.360 --> 31:46.794
...buy a tractor, stand on one leg.

31:46.963 --> 31:48.760
You had the power of persuasion?

31:48.931 --> 31:49.989
How long does it last?

31:50.166 --> 31:52.225
Until the person does
what I tell them to do.

31:52.401 --> 31:55.564
It could be two minutes, two hours.

31:55.738 --> 31:57.729
Then they come out of it
without a memory.

31:57.907 --> 31:59.465
What happens if they can't do it?

31:59.642 --> 32:03.942
They keep trying unless they're forcibly
snapped out of it, like your friend Whitney.

32:04.580 --> 32:07.674
Well, it sounds good in theory,
but how about you prove it?

32:07.850 --> 32:08.839
- Chloe.
- What?

32:09.018 --> 32:10.645
The guy lives in a crappy trailer.

32:10.820 --> 32:13.812
If he has this power, he'd use it
to sell these sculptures.

32:13.990 --> 32:16.254
It's dangerous.

32:16.592 --> 32:19.152
I'm used to living on the edge.

32:33.275 --> 32:38.542
You have feelings for Clark, don't you,
Chloe? You see him, and you want him.

32:38.714 --> 32:44.152
All this time, you've been hiding it.
Now you can show him.

33:07.476 --> 33:09.637
Okay, come on, I'm ready.

33:14.216 --> 33:17.242
What? Why are you looking
at me like that?

33:17.820 --> 33:20.687
And why is my mouth minty?

33:21.891 --> 33:24.189
Let's just say he proved his point.

33:25.995 --> 33:28.020
Oh, God, did I just...?

33:28.564 --> 33:31.431
Don't worry, it was fine.

33:32.701 --> 33:37.229
Well, now that the party trick's over,
I gotta hit the road.

33:38.074 --> 33:41.669
Wait, you have these gifts,
but you hid in the woods. Why?

33:41.844 --> 33:44.677
Because I was scared
that I wouldn't be able to control it...

33:44.847 --> 33:47.748
- ... and I'd wind up like Bob.
- What happened between you two?

33:47.917 --> 33:51.318
- Why does he want to kill you?
- He knows that I know his secret...

33:51.487 --> 33:54.183
...and I threatened to expose him
if he built a plant here.

33:54.356 --> 33:57.348
Yeah, but he's been destroying
communities like this for years.

33:57.526 --> 34:00.791
- How come you let him get away with it?
- I wanted to be left alone!

34:00.963 --> 34:04.865
- If it wasn't here, it wasn't my problem.
- My dad lost our farm because of you.

34:05.167 --> 34:08.193
Do you know what it's like to have
to hide because of who you are?

34:08.370 --> 34:10.270
Yes, I do.

34:10.438 --> 34:14.603
But when you have a gift, you can't just
hide in a hole and hope it goes away.

34:21.050 --> 34:22.312
How did you get in?

34:22.717 --> 34:26.119
Oh, your guard at the front gate
let me through. He's a great guy.

34:26.288 --> 34:28.119
I didn't realize we had a meeting.

34:28.456 --> 34:31.221
We don't. I come with an olive branch.

34:31.793 --> 34:33.920
You can call off your lawyers.

34:34.130 --> 34:37.099
I'm dropping the Kent farm
as a proposed site.

34:38.400 --> 34:41.130
What's the matter? Losing your touch?

34:43.906 --> 34:47.899
No, I've just decided Smallville
really isn't worth the hassle.

34:48.177 --> 34:50.804
At least I know where I'm not wanted.

34:50.980 --> 34:54.347
Okay, then. Thanks for stopping by.

34:54.650 --> 34:58.916
Well, since you won,
how about it? Truce?

35:16.172 --> 35:18.663
- Hello?
- Lex, it's me.

35:18.841 --> 35:20.502
What's going on?

35:20.676 --> 35:23.338
I'm with Kyle. He wants to go public
about Rickman.

35:23.512 --> 35:26.345
No kidding? What does he know?

35:26.515 --> 35:28.176
Enough to bring him down.

35:28.350 --> 35:31.717
All right, I'm coming to pick you up.
Where are you?

35:48.971 --> 35:51.462
<i>I called friends at the Planet
and the Inquisitor.</i>

35:51.707 --> 35:53.868
Would you be willing to talk to them?

35:54.043 --> 35:55.635
I'll do what I have to to stop him.

35:56.378 --> 35:59.575
Get in. I have to fill up
if we're going to Metropolis.

36:00.149 --> 36:01.377
Thanks, Lex.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.991
Lex?

36:26.075 --> 36:28.270
What's going on?

36:36.852 --> 36:38.945
Rickman's got to him!

37:08.050 --> 37:12.612
Clark, you have some explaining to do.

37:24.066 --> 37:25.966
What just happened?

37:26.135 --> 37:28.000
I have my suspicions.

37:28.170 --> 37:30.570
I hate to think that you failed
to get the job done.

37:30.739 --> 37:35.233
Relax, failing isn't something I do.

37:39.081 --> 37:41.413
Just in case.

38:00.102 --> 38:04.163
I always knew you were keeping
secrets from me, Clark.

38:05.174 --> 38:08.666
But I never thought they were this good.

38:21.290 --> 38:25.693
Clark, you know that guy
you're trying to protect?

38:25.861 --> 38:27.351
I'm gonna shoot him now.

38:28.630 --> 38:30.029
Lex.

38:30.199 --> 38:32.531
There you are.

38:34.970 --> 38:37.165
Don't do this. I'm your friend.

38:37.339 --> 38:42.709
Oh, please. You think I don't see
the way your parents look at me...

38:42.878 --> 38:47.372
...the way half the town looks at me?
You're no different.

38:47.649 --> 38:52.916
Friendship's a fairy tale, Clark. Respect
and fear are the best you can hope for.

38:53.155 --> 38:55.248
- Rickman's doing this to you.
- What if he did?

38:55.424 --> 38:58.825
- You hate Rickman.
- You can learn a lot from someone you hate.

40:04.059 --> 40:06.289
Hello, Bob.

40:13.402 --> 40:14.391
Lex!

40:26.482 --> 40:28.074
I always was the better salesman.

40:31.086 --> 40:32.110
Are you okay?

40:36.091 --> 40:38.082
I saw you get shot, Clark.

40:39.928 --> 40:43.796
Don't worry. Just don't hide
in the woods like I did.

40:44.933 --> 40:48.596
You got a gift.
Use it to do great things.

40:49.338 --> 40:51.363
I think I'll do the same with mine.

40:56.345 --> 40:58.870
I can't believe each one
of these bruises was a bullet.

40:59.448 --> 41:01.541
- Sorry.
- Guess that answers that question.

41:03.118 --> 41:06.849
It's weird. I get shot at,
and the bullets are fired by my best friend.

41:09.458 --> 41:12.359
- What do you think happened to Kyle?
- I don't know...

41:12.528 --> 41:15.964
...but I think he's out in the world
trying to make a difference now.

41:18.300 --> 41:21.633
Hi, I hope I'm not interrupting.

41:21.970 --> 41:24.131
No, come on in.

41:26.074 --> 41:28.542
We'll be outside.

41:31.980 --> 41:34.710
I didn't know if we were still talking.

41:35.817 --> 41:39.309
I'm not sure what happened with Kyle,
and it's really not important...

41:39.488 --> 41:43.652
...because I think our friendship
is worth more than one argument.

41:43.825 --> 41:45.918
Yeah, me too.

41:49.164 --> 41:51.655
You know, I thought
we were done there for a while.

41:51.833 --> 41:54.666
You and me are gonna be friends
for a very long time.

41:54.836 --> 41:58.499
We may have our ups and downs,
but that's just the way it works.

42:02.244 --> 42:04.371
Did Chloe really kiss you?

42:21.630 --> 42:23.097
Clark.

42:23.265 --> 42:24.755
Hey.

42:24.933 --> 42:31.202
Tell your dad I spoke to my lawyers.
Because of Rickman's untimely demise...

42:31.373 --> 42:34.604
...they're not expanding.
They ripped up the contract.

42:34.776 --> 42:37.370
- Thanks.
- Hey, what are friends for?

42:38.380 --> 42:40.280
How're you feeling?

42:40.449 --> 42:44.613
I still don't remember what happened.
Are you sure I didn't hurt you?

42:49.057 --> 42:51.651
I wonder where Kyle is now?

42:55.297 --> 42:57.288
I don't know.

42:57.466 --> 43:01.459
It's still strange to think he and Rickman
were once best friends.

43:03.405 --> 43:05.965
Think we'll ever end up like that?

43:07.142 --> 43:12.409
Trust me, Clark. Our friendship
is gonna be the stuff of legend.
