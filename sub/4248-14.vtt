WEBVTT

00:31.614 --> 00:35.076
OKAY GUYS, TIME TO FOCUS.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.786
IT'S THE BIG NIGHT TOMORROW.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.622
{\an1}DRESS REHEARSAL,
FIVE MINUTES.

00:39.706 --> 00:44.461
{\an4}AND THEN, AFTER WE LEFT, I
HEARD VICTOR SCREAM, LIKE
HE'D HAD A SHOCK.

00:44.544 --> 00:48.047
{\an4}IT SOUNDED LIKE A CROSS
BETWEEN A SICK WHALE AND
BROKEN PIANO.

00:48.131 --> 00:50.300
{\an1}VICTOR DEFINITELY PUT THE
PUZZLE PIECE BACK IN HIS SAFE.

00:50.383 --> 00:51.885
I CREPT BACK AND
SAW HIM DO IT.

00:51.968 --> 00:53.803
{\an1}THEN WE BREAK INTO THE SAFE
AND WE GET IT BACK!

00:53.887 --> 00:56.097
NO. HOW CAN WE? HE'D
KNOW IT WAS US.

00:56.181 --> 01:00.018
BUT WHAT IF, WHAT IF WE
HAVE THE PERFECT ALIBI.

01:00.101 --> 01:02.187
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:02.270 --> 01:03.104
I HAVE AN IDEA.

01:03.188 --> 01:07.150
{\an1}IT'S A LITTLE CRAZY, BUT
IT MIGHT JUST WORK.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.277
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.488
WHY CAN'T THE CACTUS SING?

01:11.571 --> 01:14.282
BECAUSE CACTI CAN'T SPEAK,
AMBER.

01:14.365 --> 01:15.158
{\an1}(Jerome) AND ANYWAY, YOU'VE
GOT A TERRIBLE VOICE.

01:15.241 --> 01:18.828
NO SHE HASN'T. TAKO
NOTICE FAIR CACTUS,

01:18.912 --> 01:21.039
{\an1}OKAY EVERYONE. LET'S
GET ON WITH IT.

01:21.122 --> 01:24.209
{\an1}WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THERE'S
MORE THAN ONE RELIC?

01:24.292 --> 01:28.505
{\an1}I CONFISCATED ANOTHER ONE FROM
NINA AND FABIAN LAST NIGHT.

01:28.588 --> 01:31.800
BUT, THE MARKINGS ON IT. YOU
WERE SO SURE, YOU SAID THAT,

01:31.883 --> 01:35.428
{\an1}WE WERE IN POSSESSION OF THE
ANKH ITSELF, YES.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.555
THE ONE TRUE RELIC.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.557
BUT, WE'RE NOT?

01:39.641 --> 01:44.103
NO. THERE ARE MORE.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.856
VICTOR, THE CHOSEN
HOUR APPROACHES!

01:46.940 --> 01:52.695
{\an1}DO YOU THINK I AM NOT
AWARE OF THAT!

01:52.779 --> 01:56.407
{\an1}WE HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO
WORRY ABOUT.

01:56.950 --> 02:03.873
{\an1}RUFUS ZENO HAS ESCAPED
FROM HOSPITAL.

02:06.125 --> 02:09.002
{\an1}OKAY GUYS, WELL DONE,
WELL DONE.

02:09.086 --> 02:16.553
{\an4}MICK, MARA - YOU DO REALISE YOU
WILL HAVE TO ACTUALLY KISS
TOMORROW NIGHT DON'T YOU?

02:16.636 --> 02:19.430
{\an1}SO, HIT US WITH THIS INSANE
PLAN THEN NINA.

02:19.514 --> 02:22.851
{\an4}OKAY SO TOMORROW NIGHT
EVERYONE WILL BE AT THE
PLAY RIGHT? EVEN VICTOR.

02:22.934 --> 02:26.145
SO ANUBIS HOUSE WILL
BE EMPTY.

02:26.229 --> 02:27.564
YEAH,

02:27.647 --> 02:30.233
{\an4}AFTER THE FIRST FEW SCENES,
I'M NOT ON AGAIN TILL THE
SECOND ACT.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.068
{\an1}SO, I'VE GOT ABOUT THIRTY
MINUTES TO SNEAK BACK,

02:32.151 --> 02:34.696
BREAK INTO THE SAFE,
GET THE PUZZLE PIECE

02:34.779 --> 02:37.407
{\an4}AND GET BACK TO THE PLAY
IN TIME FOR MY SECOND ACT
ENTRANCE.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.324
BRILLIANT!

02:38.408 --> 02:39.242
SIBUNA!

02:39.325 --> 02:40.076
{\an1}SIBUNA!

02:40.159 --> 02:41.953
ERM. AREN'T YOU FORGETTING
SOMETHING?

02:42.036 --> 02:42.912

02:45.456 --> 02:50.587
{\an1}(Mr Winkler) ALFIE AND JEROME,
WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU DOING?

02:50.670 --> 02:51.754
GET A MOVE ON, I'M
SWELTERING IN HERE.

02:51.838 --> 02:56.217
I CAN'T. THE ZIP'S
STUCK DUDE.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.556
{\an1}YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SLEEP
LIKE THAT.

03:01.639 --> 03:03.182
NO WAY. HIS FEET STINK!

03:03.266 --> 03:07.645
OKAY. DON'T GET THE HUMP.

WOAH!

03:17.697 --> 03:18.615
TRUDY GET ME OUT PLEASE.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.658
HANG ON.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.035
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:22.118 --> 03:26.289
{\an1}SSSH! I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER
SOMETHING.

03:38.718 --> 03:45.975
PEN AND PAPER. QUICK. QUICK.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.228
YOU'RE FREE!

03:49.312 --> 03:50.647
{\an1}I FEEL LIKE I'VE JUST BROKEN
OUT OF JAIL.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.316
A FUR-LINED JAIL.

03:53.399 --> 03:57.153
MAKE WAY. MAKE WAY.

03:58.237 --> 03:59.822
{\an1}HE PRESSED THE TOP RIGHT
ONE TWICE,

03:59.906 --> 04:02.283
THE MIDDLE ONE ONCE,

04:02.367 --> 04:06.162
AND THE BOTTOM LEFT
ONE ONCE... I THINK.

04:06.245 --> 04:07.413
YOU ONLY THINK?

04:07.497 --> 04:11.876
{\an1}WE NEED TO KNOW DEFINITELY.
NINA, YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.753
SARAH TRUSTED ME WITH
THE TREASURE.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.588
I CAN'T LET IT FALL
INTO VICTOR'S HANDS.

04:15.672 --> 04:19.384
I HAVE TO TRY...

04:19.466 --> 04:22.345
IT'S 3357.

04:27.725 --> 04:28.643
(Mick) GREAT SESSION.

04:28.726 --> 04:30.520

05:05.972 --> 05:08.224

FAVOURITE NEPHEW.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.438
ARE YOU TWO STEPPING OUT YET?

05:13.521 --> 05:15.231
STEPPING OUT? IS THAT A DANCE?

05:15.314 --> 05:16.983
NO, NO, NO WE'RE NOT.

05:17.066 --> 05:21.404
{\an1}SHAME. I LIKE THIS ONE. SHE
HAS CHEEK AND A GOOD APPETITE.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.740
WELL, I SUPPOSE I SHOULD GIVE
YOU THIS, SEEING AS I'M HERE.

05:23.823 --> 05:26.034

"UNLOCKING THE EYE".
THANK YOU UNCLE ADE.

05:28.911 --> 05:32.290

06:03.988 --> 06:06.783
IT SAYS OPEN IN PRIVATE ONLY.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.284
LET'S HAVE A LOOK,
DON'T BE SHY.

06:08.367 --> 06:11.079

NEW MAIL AND... OPEN.

06:28.387 --> 06:31.933
AND OPEN.

06:32.225 --> 06:37.438
OH DEAR.

06:42.443 --> 06:45.905
{\an4}IT'S A STORY ABOUT
TUTANKHAMEN'S SECRET
LOVER, AMNERIS.

06:45.988 --> 06:49.117
HERE, READ THIS.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.827
"BEFORE TUTANKHAMEN'S DEATH,

06:50.910 --> 06:54.163
{\an1}"THE GOD ANUBIS ENTRUSTED
AMNERIS WITH THE CUP OF ANKH.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.458
"THE CUP OF IMMORTALITY."

06:57.542 --> 07:00.169
"WHEN THE ELIXIR OF LIFE IS
DRUNK FROM THE CUP OF ANKH,

07:00.253 --> 07:02.839
"IT GRANTS IMMORTALITY TO
ALL WHO SUP FROM IT.

07:02.922 --> 07:06.676
{\an4}"IN THE WRONG HANDS, IT COULD
LEAD TO TYRANNY, DESPOTS AND
ALL OUT WAR."

07:06.759 --> 07:11.222
{\an4}"LEGEND HAS IT THAT AMNERIS
BURIED THE CUP OF ANKH WITH
HER LOVER,

07:11.305 --> 07:16.144
"INSIDE TUTANKHAMEN'S TOMB."

07:16.227 --> 07:19.063
"WHERE SHE HOPED IT WOULD
REMAIN HIDDEN FOREVER.

07:19.147 --> 07:22.066
{\an5}"BUT THERE ARE SOME WHO
BELIEVE THAT THE CUP WAS
FOUND AND REMOVED

07:22.150 --> 07:25.820
AT THE TIME OF THE TOMB'S
EXCAVATION IN 1922."

07:25.903 --> 07:31.284
{\an4}SO THE TREASURE WE'RE LOOKING
FOR IS A CUP THAT MAKES YOU
LIVE FOREVER?

07:31.367 --> 07:35.955
{\an1}NO WONDER SARAH IS SO
DESPERATE TO KEEP IT SAFE...

07:36.914 --> 07:39.417
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE
GIVING ME MY NOTICE?

07:39.500 --> 07:41.377
WHY? THE STUDENTS LOVE ME.

07:41.460 --> 07:46.716
{\an1}PERHAPS THE STUDENTS LOVE
YOU A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.136
WHO TOOK THESE?

07:50.219 --> 07:51.304
WE DON'T KNOW,

07:51.387 --> 07:53.931
{\an1}THERE IS NOTHING GOING ON
BETWEEN ME AND MICK CAMPBELL.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.725
I'M SORRY,

07:55.808 --> 08:00.521
{\an4}BUT THE SCHOOL CANNOT AFFORD
TO HAVE ANY SCANDAL ATTACHED
TO IT WHATSOEVER.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.648
<i>CURA UT VALEAS,</i> ESTHER.

08:02.732 --> 08:05.067
{\an1}WHICH MEANS "TAKE CARE
AND HAVE A LONG"

08:05.151 --> 08:07.820
YES, YES I KNOW WHAT IT
MEANS, ERIC.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.907
I'M NOT ACCEPTING THIS.

08:13.075 --> 08:15.036
THAT WENT WELL.

08:15.119 --> 08:21.000
GO AFTER HER ERIC. SHE
COULD RUIN EVERYTHING.

08:32.094 --> 08:35.139
THERE'S VICTOR.

08:35.222 --> 08:39.936
{\an4}WHAT IF IT'S A MISTAKE, TELLING
SARAH'S STORY IN FRONT OF THE
MAN WHO RUINED HER LIFE?

08:40.019 --> 08:48.069
{\an5}THERE'S YOUR UNCLE ADE!
AND IS THAT WHO I THINK IT
IS SITTING OVER THERE.

08:48.152 --> 08:50.863
WHAT'S RUFUS DOING HERE?

08:50.947 --> 08:56.911
{\an4}GUYS YOU'RE NOT ON TILL
THE SECOND ACT, CAN YOU
GET OFF STAGE PLEASE.

08:56.994 --> 08:58.287
MICK?

08:58.371 --> 09:00.122
{\an1}HELLO MISS ROBINSON. HAVE YOU
COME TO WISH ME GOOD LUCK?

09:00.206 --> 09:04.168
{\an4}NOT QUITE. ALTHOUGH YOU MAY
VERY WELL NEED IT AFTER
YOU'VE SEEN THESE.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.503
I'VE JUST BEEN KICKED OUT.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.672
AND I SUSPECT YOU MAY BE NEXT.

09:07.755 --> 09:10.007

09:20.393 --> 09:22.228
I WAS REALLY HOPING YOU
WOULD KNOW.

09:22.311 --> 09:23.980
{\an1}MAYBE IT'S A SECRET MESSAGE
FROM RUFUS?

09:24.063 --> 09:25.314
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

09:25.398 --> 09:26.315
HE'S IN THE AUDIENCE.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.734
WHAT? IS HE INSANE?

09:28.818 --> 09:32.613
WHAT IF VICTOR SEES HIM?

09:38.411 --> 09:41.455
{\an1}MAYBE IT'S HIS SEAT NUMBER?
ROW D. SEAT 4?

09:41.539 --> 09:43.082
NO RUFUS IS IN ROW G.

09:43.165 --> 09:45.876
