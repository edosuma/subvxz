WEBVTT

00:08.290 --> 00:09.460
just ignore it.

00:09.570 --> 00:11.320
Obviously.

00:13.150 --> 00:14.590
hey,what's going on?This is justin.

00:14.620 --> 00:16.920
Keep it brief,and I'll probably call you back.

00:17.050 --> 00:18.540
hey,justin,are you there?

00:18.650 --> 00:19.490
It's chelsea.

00:19.630 --> 00:22.880
I just tried calling your cell,but you didn't pick up,so...

00:22.910 --> 00:23.900
hello.

00:24.030 --> 00:25.530
Ey,chelsea.

00:25.730 --> 00:27.300
no,I'm fine.

00:27.410 --> 00:28.770
I was just,uh...

00:29.190 --> 00:30.690
running.

00:30.830 --> 00:31.420
Yeah.

00:31.900 --> 00:32.830
Uh,su-sure,yeah.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.060
Let's just--let's talk afr the meeting.

00:35.180 --> 00:36.980
Okay,all right.

00:39.680 --> 00:40.990
weren't we,uh...

00:41.120 --> 00:43.410
no.I thought she was getting a new sponsor.

00:43.510 --> 00:44.150
She will.

00:44.300 --> 00:45.490
She hasn't yet.

00:45.590 --> 00:47.060
Well,she seems awfully attached.

00:47.170 --> 00:49.520
Becca,I'm the only person in the program she's comfortable with.

00:49.630 --> 00:53.170
Maybe she would be more focused on her recovery if she wasn't so into you.

00:53.310 --> 00:54.550
she not into me.

00:54.660 --> 00:57.340
I'm just saying,she's very depdent,and I don't think it's healthy.

00:57.470 --> 00:59.150
She just wants someone to rely on,

00:59.260 --> 01:02.380
someone that's been there and made it out okay.And I'm doing okay.

01:02.490 --> 01:04.750
Check out my girlfriend.

01:04.870 --> 01:06.090
Does she even know you have a girlfriend?

01:06.200 --> 01:08.290
Yes,she knows I have A...

01:08.360 --> 01:09.530
you're jealous,aren't you?

01:09.550 --> 01:10.980
-No,I'm not.
-That's why I'm not getting any.

01:10.990 --> 01:11.810
-It's because you're jealous.
-No,I'm not.

01:11.840 --> 01:14.920
-Yes,youre.
-You're not getting any because I have to go to work.

01:14.980 --> 01:16.930
And you know ojai's finalizing the land deal today.

01:17.060 --> 01:17.980
Oh,that's awesome.

01:18.100 --> 01:19.050
-Justin!
-What?

01:19.100 --> 01:21.740
It's a big deal.It was my idea.

01:21.780 --> 01:24.840
Well,then stop worrying about chelsea,and come here and make out with me.

01:25.370 --> 01:26.610
I can't,I told you.

01:26.730 --> 01:30.360
I have to get to work,and I have to pick up kitty's baby-shower gift on the way.

01:30.390 --> 01:31.580
-All right.
-I'm sorry.

01:33.350 --> 01:35.510
Look,uh,chelsea's gonna drive me to my 5:00 meeting.

01:35.620 --> 01:38.120
Maybe you can swing by and pick me up after.

01:38.190 --> 01:40.440
What?You know my truck's in the shop.

01:40.530 --> 01:41.330
I didn't say a word.

01:41.430 --> 01:42.500
Yeah,but you're thinking it.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.060
I know what you were thinking.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.040
oh,I know I'm so foolish oh,sweetheart,it's perfect.

01:52.140 --> 01:53.520
You're a computer genius.

01:53.640 --> 01:56.670
I told you,paige,your video's gonna be the hit of the shower.

01:56.790 --> 01:58.530
Kitty is going to be thrilled.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.710
So i think we're done here,right?

02:00.820 --> 02:04.580
The favors you got are great,I picked up some jars of baby food.

02:04.660 --> 02:06.410
Wait,I thought we agreed-- no games.

02:06.490 --> 02:08.280
Oh,come on,it'll be fun.

02:08.370 --> 02:09.430
Well,kitty won't like it.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.420
She just wants a small,chic family shower.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.000
well,I don't want to argue about it now.

02:13.070 --> 02:14.040
I have a meeting.

02:14.140 --> 02:15.940
Mom,I just got an I.M.From julia.

02:16.050 --> 02:19.110
She wants to know why we're not inviting tommy.

02:19.210 --> 02:21.240
Honey,it's a baby shower.

02:21.340 --> 02:23.670
You only invite girls to baby showers.

02:23.770 --> 02:24.870
That's the tradition.

02:24.970 --> 02:30.160
But we're inviting kevin and scotty and saul.

02:30.880 --> 02:31.900
I get it.

02:32.010 --> 02:36.450
Yeah,well,I read recently it's all right to invite your gay friends and family.

02:36.560 --> 02:39.000
Well,thank you so much for coming,honey.

02:39.080 --> 02:39.950
Wait,what?What?

02:40.100 --> 02:44.140
I thought you wanted help hanging out the cute little clothesline of onesies and socks.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.020
I can do that.

02:45.110 --> 02:45.840
I don't mindelping.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.940
No,really,I need you to go.

02:48.060 --> 02:50.300
Roger's coming over for a meeting.

02:50.420 --> 02:53.640
Oh,rogeR.

02:53.740 --> 02:55.800
Okay,that's why I'm being kicked out.

02:55.890 --> 02:57.620
I'm not kicking you out.

02:57.720 --> 03:00.480
Sure,mom.You just want to go over your architectural plans.

03:00.580 --> 03:02.740
Paige,would you go upstairs and get your stuff together?

03:02.800 --> 03:04.090
I want to talk to your mother for a minute.

03:04.180 --> 03:04.840
About roger?

03:04.930 --> 03:06.240
Oh,go!

03:08.300 --> 03:12.620
What I'm about to say is all I'm going to say.

03:12.690 --> 03:15.140
You slept with him.

03:15.240 --> 03:17.650
Did you take your clothes off this time?

03:17.700 --> 03:18.630
yes.

03:19.040 --> 03:19.750
Oh,god.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.920
Mother,you little vixen.

03:22.010 --> 03:25.010
And this from a woman who accused me of being in sexual denial.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.710
Clearly I was wrong about that.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.430
How was it?

03:29.470 --> 03:30.860
I'm not gonna tell you.

03:30.890 --> 03:31.540
-Yes,you are.
-You're my daughter.

03:31.570 --> 03:32.910
-This is weird.
-Oh,come on.

03:32.990 --> 03:34.570
That's so un-- saved by the bell!

03:34.590 --> 03:35.680
Where's the phone?

03:37.310 --> 03:39.390
this has got to be the baby store.

03:39.390 --> 03:40.550
they're delivering the stroller.

03:40.560 --> 03:41.350
Hello.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.880
Hello.

03:43.900 --> 03:44.530
god.

03:44.570 --> 03:47.190
That's the second hang-up today.Damn crank calls.

03:47.240 --> 03:50.540
maybe it's roger wanting to hear you breathe.

03:50.590 --> 03:51.410
Oh,my god.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.100
What if they deliver the stroller right when you're...

03:54.220 --> 03:55.570
-go!Just go!All right,bye.
-Okay,

03:55.650 --> 04:00.080
but I'm coming back with kitty's cake,so make sure you're done before I-- go!

04:00.120 --> 04:05.310
Paigey,grandma has asked us to vacate the premises.

04:05.420 --> 04:06.640
Good-bye!

04:06.750 --> 04:07.760
Drive carefully!

04:07.880 --> 04:09.450
I love you!

04:14.660 --> 04:18.170
you know,the moment I picked up your book,I couldn't put it down.

04:18.290 --> 04:19.740
Oh,thank you.

04:19.829 --> 04:21.290
Th-thank you very much.

04:21.410 --> 04:27.690
I wish more of our graduates could bring this kind of personal insight into their work,

04:27.790 --> 04:31.410
the way you drew on your experiences growing up.

04:31.540 --> 04:32.740
I'm so sorry.

04:32.860 --> 04:34.250
I'm so sorry.

04:34.380 --> 04:36.650
It's just that this is so...

04:36.740 --> 04:38.600
strange.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.480
-Wh-what is? -I can see my dorm room from here.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.990
Do you see ramsey hall,third window from the right?

04:44.110 --> 04:45.500
that must bring back a lot of fond memories,huh?

04:45.600 --> 04:48.830
Well,I don't know about "fond," but definitely vivid.

04:49.420 --> 04:55.760
Well,kitty,our communications department is starting a new broadcast journalism program...

04:56.770 --> 04:58.740
And we need somebody to run it.

04:58.910 --> 05:02.090
Are--are you s-saying that you want me to...

05:02.200 --> 05:03.070
maybe run it?

05:03.220 --> 05:08.170
The truste specifically asked me to think outside the box,and when your name came up...

05:08.300 --> 05:09.430
my name came up?

05:09.450 --> 05:09.980
Oh,yeah.

05:10.030 --> 05:13.550
The,search committee has your name right at the top of the list.

05:13.650 --> 05:16.980
No,I-I know it doesn't sound as exting as a presidential campaign...

05:17.100 --> 05:18.180
no,no.No,no.

05:18.210 --> 05:19.750
The last thing I want is another campaign.

05:19.890 --> 05:25.860
I'm-- I actually think that a university environment might be a very nice change of pace.

05:25.980 --> 05:31.250
now the trustees want whoever we hire to hit the ground running,so

05:31.370 --> 05:35.300
do you have any prior commitments I should warn them about?

05:35.430 --> 05:36.490
no.

05:36.630 --> 05:42.260
No,no,the--the book tour is--is almost over,and...

05:42.390 --> 05:45.100
per-personally,no,no.

05:45.210 --> 05:46.140
Well,great.

05:46.250 --> 05:47.660
I'm really excited about this.

05:47.790 --> 05:48.870
Yeah,me,too.

05:48.970 --> 05:49.890
you have to go.

05:50.030 --> 05:51.540
Kitty's having a baby,saul.

05:51.670 --> 05:52.450
This is major.

05:52.570 --> 05:53.670
Great,and I'm happy for her.

05:53.780 --> 05:56.480
I also happen to be annoyed and in-insulted.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.160
Why would you be insulted?

05:58.240 --> 06:01.590
Well,first of all,I find this whole evite thing profoundly annoying.

06:01.700 --> 06:08.190
Whatever happened to proper triple-embossed paper with a nice response card and that sweet little tissue over it?

06:08.290 --> 06:11.220
So you would've gone if they'd sent you a proper paper invitation?

06:11.330 --> 06:12.290
No.

06:12.380 --> 06:15.360
No,I don't understand why the three of us would be more interested in going to a shower 

06:15.360 --> 06:19.240
than tommy or justin or even robert, who is the child's father.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.570
Because we're y,saul.

06:20.690 --> 06:22.510
We're supposed to like these kinds of things.

06:22.630 --> 06:24.040
Oh,come on,kevin that's reductive.

06:24.170 --> 06:27.070
I didn't come out of the closet to become a clich?

06:27.230 --> 06:31.630
Really.And I-I wouldn't go to a gay pride parade,either,and wear those leather things that they wear.

06:31.730 --> 06:32.310
Chaps?

06:32.420 --> 06:33.470
This is a baby shower,saul.

06:33.550 --> 06:36.340
You know,maybe,kevin,it's a generational thing.

06:36.440 --> 06:38.410
Well,what's the point of being gay if you're gonna act like this?

06:38.490 --> 06:39.540
There's no one way to be gay.

06:39.610 --> 06:42.450
Well,he's managed to pick the most dull,joyless version I've ever seen.

06:42.550 --> 06:44.220
What would your plus-one say about this?

06:44.330 --> 06:45.840
My what?

06:45.960 --> 06:47.530
Your boyfriend.

06:47.660 --> 06:49.800
Well,I'm sure he'd feel exactly the same way.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.450
He doesn't even know he's invited,does he?

06:53.010 --> 06:55.420
That's what this is all about.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.280
You're afraid to let him meet us,aren't you?

06:57.380 --> 06:59.300
Well,can you blame me for not wanting to throw him to the lions?

06:59.400 --> 07:00.530
We don't even know his name.

07:00.630 --> 07:01.190
Henry.

07:01.960 --> 07:02.890
Henry.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.180
His name is henry.

07:04.290 --> 07:05.820
-Scotty,the lamb was delicious.
-Oh,you're welcome.

07:05.910 --> 07:06.750
Whe are you going?

07:06.900 --> 07:09.200
I am not gonna stand here and be interrogated by "the view.

07:09.550 --> 07:11.400
" Well,I'm asking about your boyfriend.

07:11.490 --> 07:12.950
It's called showing an interest.

07:13.080 --> 07:15.420
Why don't you please just let me do it my way?

07:15.510 --> 07:16.930
But that's not who you are,saul.

07:17.030 --> 07:20.430
You haven't missed a family event your whole fe.

07:20.520 --> 07:21.810
Have a nice day.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.520
tell henry we said hello.

07:25.550 --> 07:27.090
that was quite a meeting.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.420
Thank god they didn't deliver the stroller.

07:30.530 --> 07:31.790
Well,maybe they did,and we never noticed.

07:31.890 --> 07:33.060
god,you're beautiful.

07:35.340 --> 07:36.290
Okay.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.050
I'm ready to go over the plans.

07:38.190 --> 07:42.690
yes,later.   I,I have something I want to discuss with you,

07:42.730 --> 07:44.830
but,I'm already late for my next meeting.

07:44.950 --> 07:47.080
Well,fine,I have a shower to throw,anyway.

07:47.210 --> 07:48.100
I'll call you later.

07:48.200 --> 07:51.250
I have to go to a site in malibu canyon,and the cell reception's a bit dodgy.

07:51.370 --> 07:52.590
-But can I see you tonight?
-Yes.

07:52.650 --> 07:55.110
-There's something I must talk to you about.
-All right.

07:55.210 --> 07:56.380
-Bye.
-ByE.

08:04.760 --> 08:08.010
Oh,roger!Ro-roger!

08:20.930 --> 08:23.620
Wendy?

08:25.610 --> 08:27.670
Oh,my god,he's married.

08:28.070 --> 08:31.380
<font color=#38B0DE>brothers.and.sisters.
Season 3 Episode 14</font>

08:31.830 --> 08:33.130
 Mama!

08:34.030 --> 08:40.780
one lemon and fresh violet cake delivered.I'm sure it's not as good as scotty's,but-- whoop.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.390
Can't compete with the chef.

08:42.780 --> 08:44.150
He's married.

08:44.260 --> 08:45.030
Who's married?

08:45.160 --> 08:47.210
Roger is married.

08:47.330 --> 08:49.040
He's been married for years.

08:49.150 --> 08:50.000
What?

08:50.090 --> 08:52.010
Oh,my god.

08:52.110 --> 08:54.470
How did you find out?

08:54.600 --> 08:58.000
We had just had the most amazing...

08:59.280 --> 08:59.930
goD.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.000
I can't even think about that right now.

09:02.180 --> 09:06.320
Afterward,I found his briefcase,and in it,just staring at me,

09:06.430 --> 09:16.580
was this invitation to some aritectural benefit hosted by roger and wendy grant.

09:16.780 --> 09:21.260
He didn't strike me as the type of guy who would...

09:21.390 --> 09:24.700
maybe it's his sister or...

09:24.820 --> 09:25.550
his mother.

09:25.660 --> 09:27.970
Oh,shut up.It's his wife.

09:28.060 --> 09:29.480
I googled him.

09:29.590 --> 09:33.910
She has a restaurant in london,which he designed.

09:34.020 --> 09:36.860
They were married in dorchester.

09:37.360 --> 09:38.540
Oh,my god.

09:38.660 --> 09:39.650
I'm the other woman.

09:39.760 --> 09:41.020
I'm holly harper.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.550
I could kill him.

09:42.660 --> 09:45.260
Look,there's got to be an explanation,you know?

09:45.370 --> 09:47.570
Oh,sarah,this is horrible.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.510
I-I like him so much.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.740
Well,then don't jump to conclusions.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.650
oh,god,what if that's him?

09:56.760 --> 09:58.590
Good,you should talk to him.

09:58.740 --> 09:59.600
Fine.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.400
Hold on.

10:02.650 --> 10:03.940
"private number.

10:08.670 --> 10:10.190
" hello.

10:10.520 --> 10:11.930
Hello.

10:13.590 --> 10:16.260
Another hang-up.Who keeps doing that?

10:16.740 --> 10:18.520
Oh,my god.

10:18.680 --> 10:19.330
It's her.

10:19.450 --> 10:20.510
It's wendy.

10:20.630 --> 10:22.140
Oh,mom,that's a huge leap.

10:22.260 --> 10:23.600
Who else could it be?

10:23.740 --> 10:24.860
Kids?

10:24.970 --> 10:26.600
A crank caller like you said?

10:26.710 --> 10:28.320
Sorry.

10:28.450 --> 10:31.960
Now I'm back to killing him.

10:32.180 --> 10:36.590
These contracts state that tommy walker and holly harper will each be tendering 2% 

10:36.590 --> 10:40.050
of their shares of ojai foods to kent barnes.

10:40.050 --> 10:41.510
This is because of you,rebecca.

10:41.610 --> 10:42.240
Oh,please.

10:42.340 --> 10:44.490
You--you guys worked out all the details.

10:44.610 --> 10:48.270
yeah,well,we could be making real money now.

10:48.370 --> 10:49.730
I need you to sign right here.

10:49.830 --> 10:55.100
This transfers the deed from crawford orchards to oi foods.

10:57.380 --> 10:58.380
okay.

10:58.510 --> 11:01.660
Ojai foods now owns a 2,000-ac established vineyard.

11:01.770 --> 11:04.090
We need the board's signatures,but they've already approved it,so...

11:04.210 --> 11:06.300
so we're all set now.

11:06.330 --> 11:07.700
Wait.

11:07.830 --> 11:09.370
There'S...one more thing.

11:09.490 --> 11:10.540
What?

11:12.060 --> 11:13.460
This...

11:13.570 --> 11:15.190
is for you.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.360
Welcome to ojai foods.

11:18.470 --> 11:19.790
all right.

11:21.720 --> 11:22.890
When do they want you to start?

11:23.010 --> 11:23.630
Immediately.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.240
Can you believe this?

11:25.380 --> 11:26.390
This is--this is crazy.

11:26.530 --> 11:28.380
I mean,I know it's not the best timing.

11:28.500 --> 11:33.890
My birth mother is due in four weeks,and I just got offered my-- my dream job.

11:34.010 --> 11:35.410
Well,will they give you a few months?

11:35.530 --> 11:36.980
What about maternity leave?

11:37.010 --> 11:37.590
I don't know.

11:37.610 --> 11:39.890
Can--can you leave before you've even started?

11:39.990 --> 11:41.420
Well,it's always worth asking.

11:41.530 --> 11:42.560
Well,that's kind of the thing.

11:42.670 --> 11:45.690
I actually,um,didn't tell them about-- about the baby?

11:47.840 --> 11:48.620
Oh,come on,sarah.

11:48.660 --> 11:51.950
I didn't want to scare them off.I mean,I can do this.I can do both.You do.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.070
Well,not when they were newborns.

11:53.210 --> 11:56.810
I took time off,and then when I went back,you know,joe was at home.

11:56.930 --> 11:58.910
Are you trying to tell me that I can't do this?

11:59.030 --> 12:02.910
No,kitty,I'must saying that the beginning is really intense,you know?

12:03.040 --> 12:04.500
To start a new job...

12:04.630 --> 12:07.390
look,sarah,I'm really excited about this.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.880
-I'm just saying,you're having a baby. -Thanks.

12:09.940 --> 12:11.280
I'm actually aware of that.

12:11.390 --> 12:14.520
Well,you might want to get a handle on how life-changing it is before you

12:14.520 --> 12:18.770
-- can you please,please just let me be excited about this for--for,like,a minute?

12:18.770 --> 12:20.800
Well,your baby shower's going to be very exciting.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.500
Mom and I are all over it.

12:22.620 --> 12:25.130
Though I have to warn you,she is planning games.

12:25.160 --> 12:26.620
Oh,come on,I said no games.

12:26.720 --> 12:27.360
I know.

12:27.460 --> 12:28.480
Grin and bear it.

12:28.610 --> 12:29.310
Fine.Okay.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.770
-Bye.
-Bye.

12:31.080 --> 12:31.680
hi!

12:32.550 --> 12:33.740
You're late.

12:33.950 --> 12:34.650
What's wrong with you?

12:34.780 --> 12:39.000
I'm just starting to feel that everybody's got more important things to do than focus on the shower.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.320
Kitty's just been offered a huge job,

12:41.320 --> 12:46.010
and mom-- I'm not even gonna pretend that I'm not gonna tell you-- is sleeping with roger.

12:46.130 --> 12:47.240
The architect?

12:47.360 --> 12:49.090
The married architect.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.220
I'm--I'm sorry.

12:51.330 --> 12:52.860
The world just shifted on its axis.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.420
My head just exploded.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.120
M,too.She just found out.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.350
She's reeling.

12:57.930 --> 13:00.480
So you gays better be there,focused and ready for fun.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.530
Yeah,I don't know how to tell you this.Saul's not coming.

13:02.530 --> 13:04.370
-What?
-He doesn't want to be marginalized.

13:04.470 --> 13:05.310
What are you talking about?

13:05.420 --> 13:06.830
-It's a long story.
-I don't wanna hear it.

13:06.830 --> 13:08.440
-Okay.
-What are you getting for kitty?

13:08.560 --> 13:09.690
-the bumper jumper?

13:09.690 --> 13:11.460
-Oh,no,you gotta get the bounce bounce baby.
--The jumper bumper?

13:11.640 --> 13:12.800
It is much more versatile.

13:12.900 --> 13:14.720
Keeps 'em entertained for hours.

13:15.150 --> 13:16.380
shower nazi.

13:16.390 --> 13:18.750
Oh,my god,can you believe sharon's story...

13:18.880 --> 13:21.580
-about the two D.U.I.S in two days?
-That's unreal.

13:21.580 --> 13:23.210
I mean,you better believe you're gonna get booked 

13:23.210 --> 13:27.240
when the cop asks you to walk a straight line and you pee your pants instead.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.080
-exactly.
-That's nasty.

13:29.250 --> 13:32.010
Hey,maybe I should ask her to be my sponsor.

13:32.130 --> 13:34.960
Yeah.You know,she-- she's come a long way.

13:35.070 --> 13:41.150
Okay,well,no offense to sharon,but I think that I connect with you much better.

13:41.270 --> 13:45.500
Yeah,but,you know,that can be a bit of a distraction.

13:45.620 --> 13:49.860
I mean,maybe-- maybe you should find somebody that,you know,can help you keep your focus a little more.

13:49.940 --> 13:52.800
Why?Do you think that I haven't been focused the last two weeks or something?

13:52.900 --> 13:54.910
No,I-- do you not want to be my sponsor anymore?

13:54.910 --> 13:55.500
No.

13:55.570 --> 13:57.450
Chelsea,I'm not allowed to be your sponsor.

13:57.460 --> 13:59.340
God.Am I that awful?

13:59.450 --> 14:00.280
No.

14:00.350 --> 14:05.660
But look,we agreed that this was temporary until you find seone-- a-a woman--that you're more comfortable with.

14:05.770 --> 14:08.330
Do you care about me at all?

14:08.750 --> 14:09.750
Yeah.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.500
You do?

14:11.650 --> 14:12.500
Of course I do.

14:12.610 --> 14:15.160
I think you're an amazing person.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.530
-whoa,chel--uh-- 
-justin!

14:23.650 --> 14:24.350
RebeccA.

14:24.460 --> 14:25.160
I'm so sorry.It's-- 

14:25.290 --> 14:26.860
no,I-I can explain.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.730
I'M...

14:37.800 --> 14:40.550
I love the way you hide the key under the watermelon cactus.

14:40.650 --> 14:42.680
In london,we don't have watermelon or cactus.

14:42.770 --> 14:43.990
We just have rain.

14:44.090 --> 14:45.870
Stay where you are.

14:46.170 --> 14:47.800
Uh,l right.Why?

14:47.830 --> 14:49.430
Put the key on the table.

14:50.270 --> 14:51.190
are we playing a game?

14:51.190 --> 14:53.250
Is this simon says?'Cause I'll do anything you say.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.320
This is not a game,roger.

14:55.430 --> 14:57.810
I am not a game.

14:57.910 --> 14:59.630
Are you married?

15:00.860 --> 15:02.160
Are you...

15:02.270 --> 15:03.530
married?

15:03.650 --> 15:06.100
This is what I've been trying to tell you,nora,before we got carried away.

15:06.110 --> 15:07.490
Carried away?

15:07.520 --> 15:09.370
You lied to me.

15:09.470 --> 15:10.730
How dare you do this to me?

15:10.820 --> 15:12.490
You know what I went through with william.

15:12.600 --> 15:13.830
Please,you don't understand.

15:13.920 --> 15:14.990
And your wife.

15:15.090 --> 15:17.230
God,your poor wife.

15:17.360 --> 15:19.560
My wife knows all about us.

15:19.680 --> 15:20.420
Oh,that's great.

15:20.530 --> 15:22.090
That is just great.

15:22.210 --> 15:24.100
That explains all the hang-ups I've been geing.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.740
She must be the one person on earth more furious than I am.

15:26.840 --> 15:29.900
Wendy's not furious at all.She's happy for us.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.160
Happy?

15:31.500 --> 15:34.270
This is what I've been trying to tell you,nora.

15:34.390 --> 15:36.420
We have an open marriage.

15:36.560 --> 15:37.810
What the hell does that mean?

15:37.910 --> 15:40.040
It means we stopped having sex years ago.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.600
In fact,it was never a big part of our relationship from the beginning.

15:42.700 --> 15:43.800
Well,then why don't you get a divorce?

15:43.900 --> 15:44.670
Because we're friends.

15:44.760 --> 15:45.520
We're good friends.

15:45.620 --> 15:49.520
It--it might sound odd,but,well...

15:49.620 --> 15:51.670
we're very happy roommates now.

15:51.750 --> 15:52.990
Roommates?

15:53.050 --> 15:54.470
How european of you.

15:54.560 --> 15:58.490
I know I should've told you earlier,but you and I happened so fast.

15:58.590 --> 16:00.480
I-I didn't know how to tell you without-- without?

16:00.600 --> 16:02.200
Without ruining it?

16:02.310 --> 16:03.210
Well,yes.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.310
I-I know it sounds selfish if you take-- it was selfish.

16:05.420 --> 16:08.650
You never asked me if I wanted to be a part of your little...

16:08.750 --> 16:09.450
arrangement.

16:09.570 --> 16:11.180
Well,I'm asking you now.

16:11.290 --> 16:12.870
It's not as complicated as you think.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.150
We're all adults.

16:15.250 --> 16:18.430
She lives 6,000 miles away.

16:18.570 --> 16:19.700
I think you should go.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.950
I have a shower to deal with.

16:24.300 --> 16:27.500
I never wanted to hurt you,nora.

16:29.890 --> 16:33.080
Please take your stuff and go.

16:54.060 --> 16:54.930
hey.

16:55.870 --> 16:58.960
You can,you can take the hat off now.

16:59.060 --> 17:01.020
I don't know.I kinda like it.

17:01.640 --> 17:02.590
Here.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.490
When am I gonna get the rest of my money?

17:05.589 --> 17:08.079
As soon as the deal clears and the shares land in my account.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.550
What if the board doesn't sign off?

17:09.660 --> 17:11.170
The board's not an issue.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.890
-Theyefer to us.
-What about holly?

17:12.980 --> 17:15.109
I gotta tell you,she didn't seem all that stupid to me.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.560
I never said she was stupid.

17:16.690 --> 17:19.270
I said she was too eager.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.310
Where'd you get the money to buy this land,anyway?

17:21.420 --> 17:21.970
It doesn't matter.

17:22.020 --> 17:24.920
What's important is she thinks she bought it from you.

17:25.030 --> 17:27.650
You must really hate her or love money.

17:27.750 --> 17:29.690
I'm not doing this for the money.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.710
I'm doing this for my family.

17:31.830 --> 17:37.050
This used to be our business,and I want it back.

17:37.170 --> 17:40.700
You're the boss.

17:43.640 --> 17:44.440
so what do you think?

17:44.550 --> 17:46.460
I mean,I have always thought about teaching.

17:46.560 --> 17:49.120
Well,would starting the program involve teaching?

17:49.190 --> 17:49.770
Well,yeah.

17:49.820 --> 17:52.120
Dr.Wilson said that I could pretty much do whatever I wanted.

17:52.220 --> 17:54.570
I-I can shape the entire curriculum.

17:54.660 --> 17:55.480
I mean...

17:55.630 --> 17:57.400
is this-- is this crazy?

17:57.490 --> 18:00.570
Well,kitty our plan has always been to keep pursuing our careers.

18:00.670 --> 18:03.740
I mean,I think you can work and be a dedicated,capable parent.

18:03.770 --> 18:04.360
-Right?-Right.

18:04.700 --> 18:05.920
You know,it--it's sarah.

18:06.010 --> 18:06.780
It's--it's sarah.

18:06.890 --> 18:08.060
She got me all confused.

18:08.150 --> 18:09.450
Well,she's a working mother.

18:09.530 --> 18:12.240
Well,yes,I know. she can speak to this.

18:12.630 --> 18:13.290
kit?

18:14.220 --> 18:15.180
oh,hi.Hey,kit.

18:15.270 --> 18:18.330
Hi.Shh.  Don't--don't tell mom that I'm here yet,okay?

18:18.430 --> 18:19.650
Never saw you.

18:19.870 --> 18:20.820
Thank you.

18:21.090 --> 18:21.920
oh,god.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.490
You know kevin's gonna have an opinion about this,too.

18:24.630 --> 18:25.160
Hi.

18:25.310 --> 18:26.020
How's it going?

18:26.130 --> 18:27.890
Where's kitty?She's not here yet.

18:27.930 --> 18:28.560
Really?

18:28.940 --> 18:30.620
Come on,mother.I can't do this without you.

18:30.740 --> 18:32.520
Julia,if the punch is ready,you can take it out.

18:32.620 --> 18:34.840
-Thank you so much.
-of course.

18:35.050 --> 18:37.420
So did you get a chance to talk to roger?

18:37.530 --> 18:39.690
I don't want this thing distracting you today.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.720
It's worse than I thought.

18:41.810 --> 18:43.430
She knows all about me.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.240
He told his wife?

18:45.370 --> 18:46.610
Oh,god.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.240
Is she furious?

18:48.380 --> 18:49.170
No.

18:49.280 --> 18:50.760
She could care less.

18:51.810 --> 18:54.990
Apparently they have an open marriage.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.530
Oh,my god.

18:57.580 --> 18:59.090
Well,that's fascinating.

18:59.220 --> 18:59.720
Fascinating?

18:59.830 --> 19:00.850
What,are you demented?

19:00.950 --> 19:02.380
Mom,could we please talk about this later?

19:02.500 --> 19:03.370
No.

19:03.550 --> 19:04.920
Give that to me.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.460
Pull yourself together.People are starting to arrive.

19:07.510 --> 19:09.970
You're right,you're right.This is my daughter's baby shower.

19:10.080 --> 19:10.850
I'm gonna let it go.

19:10.910 --> 19:12.370
That's right.Let it go.

19:12.480 --> 19:15.080
I can't believe you're sleeping with a married man.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.250
-Kevin!
-What?

19:16.360 --> 19:17.810
You told him?

19:17.930 --> 19:19.720
Oh,what do I care?

19:19.850 --> 19:23.600
Can you believe he wants me to be in an open relationship?

19:23.690 --> 19:25.360
A what?

19:26.510 --> 19:27.010
Oh,god.

19:27.030 --> 19:28.150
You didn't know that part,did you?

19:28.460 --> 19:29.830
This just gets better and better.

19:29.910 --> 19:32.090
Thanks,kevin.We were just winding down.

19:32.210 --> 19:38.670
Okaywell,if you want my opinion,I think it's great you're even considering having an open relationship.

19:38.670 --> 19:39.550
Did yojust hear that?

19:39.660 --> 19:40.760
Yes.

19:41.020 --> 19:43.290
All right,that's it.That's it.

19:43.420 --> 19:44.230
That's it.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.660
There will be no more talking about roger.

19:46.780 --> 19:49.590
For the next three hours,it's just baby,baby,baby.

19:49.700 --> 19:50.680
That's right.

19:50.790 --> 19:51.950
You can do it,mom.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.380
Of course.This is a shower.

19:53.380 --> 19:55.500
-This is what I do.
-Right.

19:55.540 --> 19:57.570
Where the hell is kitty?

19:57.620 --> 19:59.630
Damn it.I give her a time to be here...

19:59.830 --> 20:02.030
oh,god,honey.I gotta go.My mother's yelling.I love you.Bye.

20:02.170 --> 20:03.450
Okay.Bye-bye.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.890
Have we heard back on this?

20:05.000 --> 20:08.810
Yeah,we jusgot an e-mail from the R.N.C.Chairman.He is inclined to get behind your budget plan.

20:08.910 --> 20:10.870
Did I hear you telling kitty to take a job?

20:10.970 --> 20:11.570
Yes.

20:11.680 --> 20:14.680
Wexley university has asked her to start a broadcast journalism program.

20:14.770 --> 20:15.380
That's good timing.

20:15.480 --> 20:18.000
It might soften the blow when you tell her you're running forovernor.

20:18.090 --> 20:22.050
Hey,I happen to believe that you can work and be a parent,too.

20:22.150 --> 20:25.060
I also believe it'll help soften the blow when I tell her I'm running for governor.

20:25.130 --> 20:26.750
You don't have to convince me.I'm a workaholic.

20:26.880 --> 20:28.790
Well,get the hell back to work.

20:30.340 --> 20:35.430
Aunt kitty,I made this video for you and uncle robert to celebrate your baby.

20:35.430 --> 20:36.890
I hope you like it.

20:36.890 --> 20:38.180
Aww,paige.Thank you.

20:38.180 --> 20:39.740
Ready?

20:41.290 --> 20:43.370
Oh,come here,honey.You're so clever.

20:43.370 --> 20:47.540
-dear cousin,welcome to the story of the walker family.
-Paige,how did you do this?

20:47.540 --> 20:50.090
-First there was grandpa,who met grandma...
-this is great.

20:50.090 --> 20:51.940
And they fell in love and got married.

20:51.940 --> 20:54.260
Together,they planted the walker family...

20:54.260 --> 20:55.960
Sorry I'm late.

20:56.770 --> 20:59.340
We're watching paige's video.

21:00.210 --> 21:01.650
Uh,you know what,paige?

21:01.650 --> 21:04.470
Let's--let's go from the beginning.

21:04.470 --> 21:07.050
I'm sorry.I didn't mean to interrupt.But...

21:07.050 --> 21:09.220
everybody,this is henry.

21:09.220 --> 21:11.750
Henry,this is everybody.

21:11.750 --> 21:14.060
henry,hi.

21:16.010 --> 21:17.880
well,come on in.

21:24.940 --> 21:26.160
A fruit?

21:26.160 --> 21:27.720
What kind of fruit,kitty?

21:27.720 --> 21:29.680
That the game.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.950
You know what,mom?Actually,I think that this one might have gone off.

21:32.950 --> 21:34.270
That's what baby food smells like.

21:34.270 --> 21:35.810
-Nex mom,maybe we-- 
-sniff it,sarah.

21:35.810 --> 21:36.520
Sniff it.It's fun.Sniff it.

21:36.520 --> 21:39.180
No,no,I think everybody's getting tired of the games.

21:39.180 --> 21:40.270
Oh,come on,guys.

21:40.270 --> 21:42.150
This is what you do at baby showers.

21:42.150 --> 21:43.680
Okay.

21:44.040 --> 21:44.930
peach?

21:44.930 --> 21:46.440
No.Apricot.

21:46.440 --> 21:48.660
How could you not know that?You're a mother.

21:48.660 --> 21:50.040
mom,you just blew it.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.440
Henry was next.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.490
No,no,it's all right.

21:52.490 --> 21:54.390
I'm allergic to apricots anyway.

21:54.390 --> 21:56.520
I'm sorry,henry.I get so excited at showers.

21:56.520 --> 21:58.640
You know what?Maybe we should just open the presents.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.640
I'm up-- you know,I-I do--I think it's a great idea.

22:00.640 --> 22:01.290
-I agree.
-Good idea.

22:01.290 --> 22:04.100
Okay,fine.No one won.

22:04.100 --> 22:04.920
So...

22:04.920 --> 22:06.570
on to the gifts.

22:06.570 --> 22:07.650
okay,good.

22:07.650 --> 22:09.600
Okay,rebecca you take care of the trash.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.350
I need someone to record all the presents.

22:12.350 --> 22:13.150
I'll do that.

22:13.150 --> 22:14.950
You can't do that.You don't even know who anybody is.

22:14.950 --> 22:17.180
What better way to learn?

22:19.040 --> 22:20.080
He trying too hard,isn't he?

22:20.080 --> 22:21.820
Oh,relax.He's doing fine.

22:21.820 --> 22:22.780
-Really?
-Not at all.

22:22.780 --> 22:25.760
Okay,kitty,you sit here.

22:25.760 --> 22:26.500
No,I'm--I'm okay.

22:26.500 --> 22:27.840
You're the guest of honor.

22:27.840 --> 22:30.230
This is--this is where you're supposed to sit.

22:30.230 --> 22:31.920
Okay,fine.Fine.I'm--fine.

22:31.920 --> 22:34.110
Okay,I will.No problem at all.

22:34.110 --> 22:36.530
Here I am.Here I am.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.810
I'll get the gifts.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.470
Henry,it's so nice to meet you at last.

22:42.470 --> 22:43.430
You,too,kevin.

22:43.430 --> 22:44.960
Sauly's told me so much about you.

22:44.960 --> 22:46.520
Sauly?

22:46.520 --> 22:47.950
how did you two meet?

22:47.950 --> 22:48.860
At the symphony.

22:48.860 --> 22:49.830
Right.

22:49.830 --> 22:51.030
Whose gift is this?

22:51.030 --> 22:52.610
-We'd both just finished reading the same book.
-RighT.

22:52.610 --> 22:53.820
-Whose present is this?
-I was holding the book.

22:53.820 --> 22:55.400
-It was open,so he saw it.
-Pretentious book.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.950
-It was a brilliant book.
-what was it?

22:57.950 --> 23:00.800
Whose gift is this?Come on,people.Listen up.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.060
Oh,that's my gift.

23:02.060 --> 23:04.070
mom,just tone it down a notch.

23:04.070 --> 23:06.930
Fine,fine,fine,fine,fine.

23:06.930 --> 23:08.480
So start opening.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.630
We have a lot to get through.

23:13.730 --> 23:15.680
Hey,justin,it's me.I'm at the shower.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.680
Uh,just wanted to see if everything was okay,

23:17.680 --> 23:19.060
if you'd talked to chelsea.

23:19.060 --> 23:22.940
So,um,give me a call back.My phone's on.Bye.

23:28.590 --> 23:29.940
Can I help with the garbage?

23:29.940 --> 23:32.010
It's pretty rough out there.

23:32.010 --> 23:33.660
Yes,you may.

23:34.370 --> 23:35.900
Is everything all right with justin?

23:35.900 --> 23:39.490
Uh,yeah.We're just,um,kind of going through...

23:39.490 --> 23:40.620
a weird thing right now.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.190
Is he mad you're working so hard?

23:42.190 --> 23:44.660
I know tommy's been there morning,noon and night.

23:44.660 --> 23:46.820
Well,now that the deal's done.He'll have more time.

23:46.820 --> 23:47.750
What deal?

23:47.750 --> 23:49.970
You don't know?We bought an orchard.It's huge.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.760
No.He didn't say a word.

23:51.760 --> 23:52.780
Really?

23:52.780 --> 23:55.980
I guess that's why he's been so stressed.

23:56.450 --> 23:57.950
You want to hear something i do know?

23:57.950 --> 23:59.630
Is it about saul's boyfriend?

23:59.630 --> 24:01.000
No,about nora.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.730
I thought she was acting weird.

24:02.730 --> 24:04.200
You don't know the half of it.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.880
Wow,kev.I mean,it's-- it's so colorful.

24:06.880 --> 24:07.750
Sarah made me buy it.

24:07.750 --> 24:12.110
Babies live for this because-- look,it's so safe and very musical.

24:12.110 --> 24:13.150
-see?
-RighT.

24:13.150 --> 24:15.490
It's--it's very cool.It's very cool.I love it.

24:15.490 --> 24:18.310
Now for the pièce de résistance.

24:20.940 --> 24:22.810
I mean,I-I don't even know what to say.

24:22.810 --> 24:25.400
I mean,you guys have been so incredibly generous.

24:25.400 --> 24:29.780
And I-I guess I'm gonna have to build a new room in my house to fit all this stuff.

24:29.780 --> 24:30.860
I mean,come on,right?Who knew?

24:30.860 --> 24:34.670
Who knew that just a little baby was gonna need all this stuff?

24:34.670 --> 24:35.990
Welcome to motherhood.

24:35.990 --> 24:36.850
Right.Right.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.470
Well,I guess I did know.

24:38.470 --> 24:39.950
I mean,I did gister.

24:39.950 --> 24:43.240
But seeing it all here,it just seems like a lot.

24:43.240 --> 24:44.440
okay.

24:44.440 --> 24:46.100
Okay,here we go.

24:46.100 --> 24:47.080
Sit right there.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.600
I'm just gonna do this.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.260
Here it is.

24:52.450 --> 24:53.700
Oh,my god.

24:53.700 --> 24:54.660
You got that one?

24:54.660 --> 24:56.940
It's the most expensive stroller on the market.

24:56.940 --> 24:59.690
I didn't really need the most expensive stroller on the market.

24:59.690 --> 25:00.860
Yes,you do.

25:00.860 --> 25:02.610
-It is so light...
-it's so light.

25:02.610 --> 25:05.800
It collapses very easily,and you can turn baby to face you.

25:05.800 --> 25:06.900
So come here.I'll show you how to fold it.

25:06.900 --> 25:08.400
Not now.Not in front of everybody.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.250
No,I'm not--I'm not very good at gadgets.

25:10.250 --> 25:12.740
It's not a gadget,honey.It's a stroller.Come here,come here.

25:12.740 --> 25:14.450
Mom,there's a pedal there-- put your foot on this pedal,the left pedal.

25:14.450 --> 25:16.570
Here,put one hand here on that little button,

25:16.570 --> 25:18.250
and one hand on this little button.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.350
We don't need to do the pedals on this one.

25:20.350 --> 25:21.570
Just lift up.

25:21.570 --> 25:23.280
Pull the buttons toward you.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.870
Just pull up.Pull up.Pull up.

25:24.870 --> 25:25.950
-Try again.Try again.
-No,no,I can'T.

25:25.950 --> 25:27.190
Do it.Do it.

25:27.190 --> 25:29.090
-I can't do it.
-You can do it.

25:29.090 --> 25:31.950
Maybe kitty might like to watch the instructional dvd video.

25:31.950 --> 25:35.920
Sarah,I don't wanna have to watch an instructional video to learn how to work a stroller.

25:35.920 --> 25:38.440
I told you that I didn't want an expensive stroller anyway.

25:38.440 --> 25:41.830
And also told you that I didn't want the games.

25:41.830 --> 25:43.540
All right?I'm sorry.

25:43.540 --> 25:45.490
I'm sorry.

25:46.530 --> 25:49.150
I'm,uh,excuse me.

25:59.540 --> 26:01.840
Kitty,what's going on?

26:01.840 --> 26:02.860
Uh,n-nothing.

26:02.860 --> 26:03.870
Nothing.

26:03.870 --> 26:05.370
I-I-I just need to make a phone call.

26:05.370 --> 26:06.720
Now,during your shower?

26:06.720 --> 26:08.180
Mom,I-I have a lot going on.

26:08.180 --> 26:10.690
We all have a lot going on.

26:11.160 --> 26:13.070
Okay,fine.

26:13.070 --> 26:17.030
I was offered,um,an amazing job opportunity yesterday.

26:17.030 --> 26:19.030
Wexley university,they--

26:19.030 --> 26:23.830
well,they want me to run the new broadcast journalism program.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.190
When would it start?

26:28.190 --> 26:29.390
Immediately.

26:29.390 --> 26:30.600
I know.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.290
I'm having a baby.

26:32.290 --> 26:33.580
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

26:33.580 --> 26:36.290
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

26:36.290 --> 26:38.950
And--and frankly,today was just...

26:38.950 --> 26:39.980
I-I don't--I don't know.

26:39.980 --> 26:41.660
It was just a little bit more than I expected.

26:41.660 --> 26:43.640
I mean,I-I told you to cut the games and I told you that

26:43.640 --> 26:45.660
I didn't need the rolls-royce of baby strollers.

26:45.660 --> 26:48.470
And I just don't understand why people just can't have a baby without all of this--

26:48.470 --> 26:51.020
this pomp and circumstance.

26:51.020 --> 26:53.770
Is that what this is to you,pomp and circumstance?

26:53.770 --> 26:57.320
Well,I-I guess I'm just not as traditional as you are.

26:57.320 --> 26:58.820
Well,there you are.

26:58.820 --> 27:01.480
That's the problem.I'm just too traditional.

27:01.480 --> 27:03.770
Why should anyone listen to society's rules?

27:03.770 --> 27:06.110
They're just a bunch of outdated,prudish mandates.

27:06.110 --> 27:07.010
"Prudish"?

27:07.010 --> 27:08.130
What--what does that have to do with anything?

27:08.130 --> 27:10.080
Everything.Nothing.

27:10.080 --> 27:11.570
God,you know,I'm done.

27:11.570 --> 27:12.720
I'm done trying.

27:12.720 --> 27:16.980
Obviously I'm just a-a dithering old fuddy-duddy standing in the way of everyone's fun.

27:16.980 --> 27:18.820
So go ahead.Make your phone calls.

27:18.820 --> 27:20.650
Just pretend this baby isn't coming.

27:20.650 --> 27:23.210
Wh-- 

27:25.710 --> 27:26.860
what was that about?

27:26.860 --> 27:28.490
No.No.You know what?

27:28.490 --> 27:31.230
I don't need to hear it from you,too.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.390
It's not that I don't want to have a baby.

27:39.390 --> 27:41.410
Ofourse I do.You know I do.

27:41.410 --> 27:42.890
I know.

27:42.890 --> 27:44.130
Here.

27:44.810 --> 27:46.510
One of the perks of adoption.

27:46.510 --> 27:50.570
It's just that I just spent so much time worrying about whether or not

27:50.570 --> 27:52.740
it--it was going to happen that I never--

27:52.740 --> 27:55.970
had time to think about what it would be like when it did?

27:55.970 --> 27:58.140
Right.Right.

27:58.450 --> 27:59.880
Maybe I am in denial.

27:59.880 --> 28:03.440
I keep trying to pretend that my life isn't going to change.

28:03.440 --> 28:04.320
And that'S...

28:04.320 --> 28:05.570
I mean,my god,right?

28:05.570 --> 28:07.000
What's wrong with me 

28:07.000 --> 28:12.750
well,for a start,your body hasn't been telling you every hour of every day what's about to happen.

28:12.750 --> 28:14.720
Strangers haven't been rubbing your belly.

28:14.720 --> 28:18.180
You've escaped the fat ankles and stretch marks.

28:18.180 --> 28:20.760
Well,I'm terrified.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.060
Is...

28:22.060 --> 28:23.210
that part of the deal?

28:23.210 --> 28:25.860
Oh,yeah.You should've seen me before paige came.

28:25.860 --> 28:27.120
I did.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.120
You seemed fine.

28:28.120 --> 28:30.100
Yeah,on the outside.On the inside?

28:30.100 --> 28:32.670
I was a bundle of anxiety.

28:32.670 --> 28:35.530
I was worried that I'd have to go back toork too early,

28:35.530 --> 28:37.510
that I wouldn't be able to give paige what she needed,

28:37.510 --> 28:40.740
that I'd ruin her life,that she'd ruin mine.

28:40.740 --> 28:43.310
And then she came,and...

28:43.650 --> 28:48.560
everything was so much more amazing than I could've imagined.

28:50.360 --> 28:52.360
Did my present freak her out?

28:52.360 --> 28:53.120
no.

28:53.120 --> 28:54.770
I freaked her out.

28:54.770 --> 28:56.230
Well,you've had a lot on your mind.

28:56.230 --> 28:57.200
Yeah,no kidding.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.680
Kevin,you know what?Not now.

28:58.680 --> 28:59.890
it's okay.

28:59.890 --> 29:02.770
Nora,kevin told us what's going on,so it's fine.

29:02.770 --> 29:03.980
And what would that be,saul?

29:03.980 --> 29:05.870
What was kevin referring to?

29:05.870 --> 29:09.450
The fact that I find myself involved in an open relationship with roger

29:09.450 --> 29:13.570
or the fact that I was in there yelling at kitty and saying she was barely aware she's having a baby?

29:13.570 --> 29:14.670
You did that?

29:14.670 --> 29:16.480
yes,it's what I did.

29:16.480 --> 29:20.130
I just get so sick of everybody telling me I'm too traditional.

29:20.130 --> 29:24.640
My showers are too traditional,the choices in men are too traditional.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.060
Why do you care what people say?

29:26.060 --> 29:28.980
You've never had trouble standing up for what you believe before?

29:28.980 --> 29:32.630
Because I like him,and I don't want to stop seeing him.

29:32.630 --> 29:34.260
Well,then don'T.

29:34.260 --> 29:36.260
But then I'm doing something I don't believe in.

29:36.260 --> 29:38.520
Uh,may I,uh,say something?

29:38.520 --> 29:40.650
Oh,god.Henry.

29:40.650 --> 29:42.900
this is not how I wanted to meet you.

29:42.900 --> 29:46.810
Wh i was gonna say--I once heard of a couples' study.

29:46.810 --> 29:49.680
Uh,half the couples were in a monogamous relationship.

29:49.680 --> 29:52.000
The other half were in,uh,open ones.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.130
At the end,they ask everybody,"are you happy?

29:56.130 --> 30:00.850
" The result was exactly the same for both groups.

30:01.660 --> 30:03.070
What's your point?

30:03.070 --> 30:07.880
You can be happy in,uh,any kind of relationship.

30:08.740 --> 30:09.840
mom.

30:09.840 --> 30:11.410
I'm sorry.I'm so sorry.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.060
-No,no,I'm sorry.
-No,I'm so sorry.

30:13.060 --> 30:15.580
-You gave me wonderful shower...
-kitty,you're going to be a wonderful mother.

30:15.580 --> 30:17.710
-And I really do appreciate all your hard work.
-I'm gonna take that stroller back.

30:17.710 --> 30:18.950
You hate that stroller.

30:18.950 --> 30:19.700
-It's the wrong color.
-No,no,no,no.

30:19.700 --> 30:21.960
I love the stroller.I was being stupid.

30:21.960 --> 30:23.770
I-I...I'm sorry.

30:23.770 --> 30:26.430
-I'm so sorry.
-No,I'm so sorry.

30:26.430 --> 30:27.970
I'm sorry.

30:27.970 --> 30:30.300
-I'm sorry.
-Nice.

30:30.300 --> 30:32.390
Okay,well,uh,let's have cake.

30:32.390 --> 30:33.290
Where's paige?

30:33.290 --> 30:35.210
Oh,she's,uh,she's watching the video again with scotty.

30:35.210 --> 30:36.500
Wait,wait,wait,wait,wait,wait.

30:36.500 --> 30:40.770
Before we have cake,there's actually,uh,one more present.

30:40.770 --> 30:43.570
-Oh,god.
-It's something for mom.

30:43.570 --> 30:48.560
It's--robert and I,um,spoke with trish,and she said that

30:48.560 --> 30:51.990
it would be okay if we were in the delivery room for the birth.

30:51.990 --> 30:57.420
And we asked her if it would be okay if you were there,too.

30:57.420 --> 30:58.330
Oh,kitty.

30:58.330 --> 31:00.010
And she said that it would be fine.

31:00.010 --> 31:02.710
So,um,we--we really want you to be there,

31:02.710 --> 31:07.080
and I can't imagine anything that would mean more to me.

31:07.080 --> 31:08.950
So,um...

31:09.460 --> 31:10.220
would you?

31:10.220 --> 31:11.510
Of course.

31:11.510 --> 31:13.690
Of course I'll be there.

31:13.690 --> 31:15.250
Of course I'll be there.

31:15.250 --> 31:17.400
Thank you.

31:18.270 --> 31:19.110
thanks for your help.

31:19.110 --> 31:20.490
It was a great opportunity.

31:20.490 --> 31:21.270
Oh,thanks,man.Look,sorry.

31:21.270 --> 31:22.990
I just have to say good-bye to my mother.

31:22.990 --> 31:24.560
-All right.
-Take care.

31:24.560 --> 31:26.380
Mom,thanks.

31:26.380 --> 31:28.650
Well,no need to thank me.The vote was unanimous.

31:28.650 --> 31:32.140
I heard the,uh,shower was exciting.

31:32.540 --> 31:34.530
The shower w more like a thunderstorm.

31:34.530 --> 31:36.280
Talk to you later,honey 

31:37.600 --> 31:39.650
so how was your first board meeting?

31:39.650 --> 31:40.740
It was great.

31:40.740 --> 31:42.490
It's good to have this deal done.

31:42.490 --> 31:44.930
I've seen parties negotiate for years.

31:44.930 --> 31:48.240
I mean,tommy just called me two months ago.

31:48.970 --> 31:51.120
Two months ago?

31:51.120 --> 31:52.520
Yeah.

31:52.520 --> 31:55.250
Well,look,I,uh,I'm--I'm sure I'll be seeing you soon.

31:55.250 --> 31:56.990
Absolutely.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.730
Holly.

32:08.730 --> 32:09.970
Nora.

32:09.970 --> 32:11.740
I just wanted to say congratulations.

32:11.740 --> 32:16.430
Rebecca is doing so well,and I'm--i'm really happy for her.

32:16.430 --> 32:18.590
Thank you,nora.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.990
Holly,can I ask you a question?

32:26.990 --> 32:28.460
Sure.

32:29.180 --> 32:33.090
I have a friend who found out the man she's seeing is married,

32:33.090 --> 32:36.180
and she's--she's feeling...

32:37.620 --> 32:38.880
you're...

32:38.880 --> 32:41.850
dating a married man?

32:41.850 --> 32:42.890
YeS.

32:42.890 --> 32:44.920
oh,lord.

32:44.920 --> 32:46.530
I'm speechless.

32:46.530 --> 32:49.030
Well,I didn't know he was married when it started.

32:49.420 --> 32:50.450
He didn't tell you?

32:50.450 --> 32:51.550
No.

32:51.550 --> 32:55.250
Did william tell you,holly?

32:55.250 --> 32:58.710
Actually,he didn't,not at first.

32:58.710 --> 33:00.780
Well,there's a big difference in my situation.

33:00.780 --> 33:03.660
You see,his wife knows all about us.

33:03.660 --> 33:05.570
They have an open marriage.

33:05.570 --> 33:08.740
This just keeps getting better and betteR.

33:08.740 --> 33:11.890
What that little miss pasadena's in a 3-way thing?

33:11.890 --> 33:15.390
Well,it's just so very modern of you.

33:15.390 --> 33:19.420
Yes,well,I don't know that I'm actually happy about that...

33:19.920 --> 33:22.500
were you happy,holly?

33:22.780 --> 33:24.130
You mean...

33:24.130 --> 33:26.700
with your husband?

33:26.700 --> 33:29.440
Yes,with my husband.

33:30.290 --> 33:31.990
Nora,I-I just...

33:31.990 --> 33:35.700
don't look at life like your average girl.

33:35.700 --> 33:39.480
I like to just jump in there,have fun,let it roll.

33:39.480 --> 33:42.150
I like not being tied down.

33:42.150 --> 33:47.380
And it was convenient knowing that he had you to go home to.

33:48.550 --> 33:52.750
I just hope that's enough for you.

33:52.910 --> 33:56.060
Well,let us not forget there was someone else,

33:56.060 --> 34:00.980
and he managed to father ryan with that someone else.

34:00.980 --> 34:07.540
You asked me if I was happy,and I was,most of the time.

34:07.910 --> 34:10.460
But it wasn't easy.

34:33.770 --> 34:35.469
I thought you were gonna be at the office.

34:35.469 --> 34:37.120
I need to talk to you.

34:37.120 --> 34:40.440
If this is about the chelsea thing,I-I ended it,rebecca.

34:40.440 --> 34:43.370
No,it's not about chelsea.

34:43.690 --> 34:44.580
What's going on?

34:44.580 --> 34:47.300
Justin,there's something not right about this property deal.

34:47.300 --> 34:48.409
What's the matter?

34:48.409 --> 34:50.389
I don't know.This--this guy kent,

34:50.389 --> 34:52.550
he said that tommy called him two months ago.

34:52.550 --> 34:54.989
I didn'talk to tommy about buying the land two months ago.

34:54.989 --> 34:57.640
It was last month.So how could it be my idea?

34:57.640 --> 35:00.790
Maybe kent had the wrong date or maybe tommy called about something else.

35:00.790 --> 35:02.440
No,I looked at tommy's computer.

35:02.440 --> 35:05.170
He downloaded pictures of the crawford property back in december.

35:05.170 --> 35:07.060
Wait,you went through tommy's computer without him knowing?

35:07.060 --> 35:08.240
Are you listening to me?

35:08.240 --> 35:10.750
Tommy set this whole thing up.He didn't even talk to julia about it.

35:10.750 --> 35:12.240
I mean,he's been keeping this a secret.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.270
Rebecca,you're being paranoid.

35:13.270 --> 35:14.270
I don't think that I am.

35:14.270 --> 35:16.560
You're breaking into tommy's computer,all right?

35:16.560 --> 35:19.470
You haven't said one thing that's not complete speculation.

35:19.470 --> 35:20.560
What if it's about my mom?

35:20.560 --> 35:21.620
What if he's trying to get back at her?

35:21.620 --> 35:23.570
Let this go,all right?Please.

35:23.570 --> 35:25.420
We said we'd keep all this stuff separate from us,

35:25.420 --> 35:26.830
and tommy woulnever do that.

35:26.830 --> 35:27.710
What makes you so sure?

35:27.710 --> 35:28.880
Because he's my brother.

35:28.880 --> 35:33.260
Oh,my god.Could you stop being so loyal to your family for once in your life and just listen?

35:33.260 --> 35:37.470
And listen to what?Listen to my girlfriend,who's hacking into computers?

35:37.470 --> 35:39.980
-I walked up to see you kissing another girl.
-Oh,my god.

35:39.980 --> 35:41.210
She kissed me.

35:41.210 --> 35:43.680
Okay,and I'm doing my best to trust that that's true.

35:43.680 --> 35:44.640
What,you don't believe me?

35:44.640 --> 35:46.200
I do believe you.That's the point.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.710
I always give you the benefit of the doubt.

35:47.710 --> 35:49.390
I don't understand why you can't do the same r me.

35:49.390 --> 35:52.100
Because you're attacking my family,the people I love!

35:52.100 --> 35:54.710
What about me?Why is it always about your family?

35:54.710 --> 35:56.940
-I need to matt,too.
-You do matter.

35:56.940 --> 36:00.070
What-- no,I don't feel that way,justin.

36:00.440 --> 36:02.210
You know what?Forget it.

36:02.210 --> 36:04.610
Forget it.Maybe you're right.

36:05.260 --> 36:06.440
Rebecca,where are you going?

36:06.440 --> 36:09.800
I don't kn.I don't know anything anymore.

36:19.210 --> 36:21.100
I,uh,I took it as A...

36:21.100 --> 36:23.670
a positive sign that the key was still under the cactus.

36:23.670 --> 36:26.620
The key is always under the cactus.

36:26.780 --> 36:27.800
I'm glad to see you.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.670
I'm glad to see you,too.

36:29.670 --> 36:30.940
Now sit down.

36:30.940 --> 36:31.960
-No.
-Please.

36:31.960 --> 36:35.470
-I have something to say.
-I'd rather stand.

36:36.480 --> 36:38.380
Nora,um...

36:38.380 --> 36:42.480
your contrary nature is one of the things I love most about you.

36:42.690 --> 36:48.940
But,um,sometimes I think you denyourself certain pleasures out of sheer stubbornness.

36:48.940 --> 36:54.060
And I'm not gonna let you ruin a romance that we're both clearly enjoying a lot 

36:54.060 --> 36:57.420
because of some wrongheaded notion you have of what constitutes a marriage.

36:57.420 --> 36:58.770
You're just ing stubborn.

36:58.770 --> 37:00.560
That's not true.

37:00.560 --> 37:03.150
You have a right to arrange your marriage any way you want.

37:03.150 --> 37:05.810
Maybe if william and i had done it your way,

37:05.810 --> 37:08.400
I would've had a lomore interesting life.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.170
You're about to say "but," aren't you?

37:10.170 --> 37:12.640
-But-- 
-I knew it.

37:13.480 --> 37:14.880
BuT...

37:15.770 --> 37:18.760
I'm just not that kind of girl.

37:19.130 --> 37:24.270
There was one little moment I tried to convince myself it didn't matter.

37:24.270 --> 37:26.240
It was...

37:26.240 --> 37:27.130
exciting.
