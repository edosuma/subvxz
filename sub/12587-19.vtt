WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:03.633
Yep.

00:04.880 --> 00:06.382
Yep.

00:06.381 --> 00:07.883
Mm-hmm.

00:07.883 --> 00:11.262
So, what do you guys
want to do today?

00:11.261 --> 00:12.638
Well, hmm.

00:12.638 --> 00:14.811
We fixed Boomhauer's car.

00:14.806 --> 00:17.901
We've gotten Bill's house
as far as it's gonna go.

00:17.893 --> 00:21.488
Does anybody have anything
to varnish or weather-strip?

00:23.273 --> 00:24.741
I remember I need to...

00:24.733 --> 00:26.906
Oh, wait.

00:26.902 --> 00:27.903
Never mind.

00:27.903 --> 00:29.075
I did that this morning.

00:29.071 --> 00:31.665
Are you saying"-

00:31.657 --> 00:32.658
Oh, my God!

00:32.658 --> 00:34.456
We're out of projects!

00:34.451 --> 00:36.419
We have nothing to do.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:10.529 --> 01:12.452
And the sign-up sheet

01:12.447 --> 01:15.166
for the Asthma Olympics
is in the gym.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.876
And be sure
to pick up your tickets

01:17.035 --> 01:18.912
for this year's
homecoming dance.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.882
Dude, we got to ask someone
to the dance fast.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.967
More and more girls
are getting boobs,

01:23.959 --> 01:26.428
so there're not as many
desperate ones anymore.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.343
We can't rush
into a date, Joseph.

01:28.338 --> 01:32.809
It's just like when you go
to get ice cream at 61 Flavors.

01:32.801 --> 01:35.680
You don't just go
with the first tub of vanilla.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.807
You scope out the whole case.

01:37.806 --> 01:41.606
Dude, the football team got
most of the good ice cream.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.821
Vanilla sounds pretty
good right now.

01:43.979 --> 01:45.822
Oh, I need a girl.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.317
I need one now!

01:48.317 --> 01:51.287
You! Go to the
dance with me!

01:51.278 --> 01:52.575
Uh, okay.

01:52.571 --> 01:55.370
Eh, better than nothing.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.919
Oh, my God!

01:58.910 --> 02:00.912
I need better than nothing, too.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.335
I need to find a date.

02:10.839 --> 02:11.806
Oh, look.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.641
Spongy's up to my cans.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.850
Good-bye, little beer cans.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.019
You tried your best to help me.

02:22.434 --> 02:25.313
Well, that's an impressive cart
Spongy's got there.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.360
Yeah, man, talking 'bout
like, like a dang ol'

02:27.356 --> 02:28.699
Battle-Cart
Galactica, man.

02:28.690 --> 02:32.160
Superb handling,
excellent turning radius.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.904
How did Spongy do it?

02:33.904 --> 02:35.497
I wonder if it's
the ball bearings or...

02:35.489 --> 02:36.911
Gyroscope?

02:36.907 --> 02:39.205
I don't know, low center of
gravity on that dang ol'.

02:39.201 --> 02:41.545
Well, I guess the only way
to find out

02:41.536 --> 02:43.914
would be to build
a super cart of our own.

02:43.914 --> 02:46.212
We found a project!

02:50.879 --> 02:54.258
What was I thinking,
waiting this long to get a date?

02:54.257 --> 02:55.634
Oh.

02:55.634 --> 02:56.760
There's Kerry Harris.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.886
No one's asked her yet

02:57.886 --> 03:00.389
because she has
a tiny hole in her heart.

03:00.389 --> 03:01.857
Jackpot!

03:03.141 --> 03:04.859
Acne Pete is moving in!

03:04.851 --> 03:05.898
Go! Go!

03:05.894 --> 03:07.896
I...
Hi. You go to dance?

03:07.896 --> 03:10.524
I mean, you want to go
to the dance?

03:10.524 --> 03:12.526
I mean, you want, with me?

03:12.526 --> 03:13.903
I'm sorry.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.906
You're sweet,
but... no.

03:16.905 --> 03:17.906
I'm sorry.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.249
Thanks, but...

03:19.241 --> 03:21.084
Um, no.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.295
What do you think?

03:27.290 --> 03:29.759
Hmm, he's got possibilities.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.048
Could be a project.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.261
Agreed.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.848
You know, I always like
the way you say "project."

03:35.006 --> 03:38.681
It sounds so much nicer
than "target."

03:46.893 --> 03:50.318
Anyone sitting here?
I guess I am. Hi.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.906
Um, hi?

03:51.898 --> 03:52.899
Uh...

03:52.899 --> 03:54.901
Bobby Hill, I'm Bethany.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.903
Aw, you look so sad.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.905
A sad little Popsicle.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.328
Don't be a sad little Popsicle.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.497
I'm not sad, really.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.712
It's just that I'm probably
going to be alone

04:05.704 --> 04:08.048
for the rest
of my miserable life.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.718
Hey, we could be your buddies.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.633
We'll be Bobby buddies.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.881
Aren't you both from
the advanced class?

04:15.881 --> 04:18.725
Girls like you never
talk to guys like me.

04:18.716 --> 04:19.809
Oh, no!

04:19.801 --> 04:21.098
We're breaking rules.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.721
We'll be thrown in jail!

04:22.721 --> 04:24.644
Will you visit us
in jail, Bobby?

04:24.639 --> 04:25.811
I'd like you to.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.100
Hey ya, girls.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.317
Hmm...

04:28.310 --> 04:29.903
Where'd you snag the cuteness?

04:29.895 --> 04:31.897
Am I the cuteness?

04:31.897 --> 04:33.524
Ooh, Bethy,

04:33.523 --> 04:34.991
his hair feels nice.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.785
I've never thought
about it, but,

04:44.785 --> 04:48.915
yeah, if bear cubs could talk,
they'd sound like me.

04:48.914 --> 04:51.963
Oh, Bobby, could you
be more precious?

04:51.958 --> 04:54.757
After taking a moment
to confer with myself,

04:54.753 --> 04:57.051
I've decided no, you could not.

04:57.047 --> 05:00.893
Dude, he's like
the girl whisperer.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.137
If this school was
a deck of cards,

05:03.136 --> 05:05.059
Bobby would be
the king of hearts,

05:05.055 --> 05:06.898
two of us would be jokers

05:06.890 --> 05:09.894
and the other one would be
that card with the rules on it.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.521
So, uh, where are you guys at

05:12.521 --> 05:14.319
with the whole homecoming thing?

05:14.314 --> 05:16.533
Because if you need a date...

05:16.525 --> 05:18.152
Yes.
I can't wait!

05:18.151 --> 05:19.869
This is such a magical day!

05:19.861 --> 05:20.908
Really?

05:20.904 --> 05:24.579
So, uh, which one of you
do I get to go with?

05:24.574 --> 05:25.791
You're going with all of us.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.286
Otherwise we'd fight for you.

05:27.285 --> 05:28.537
It'd get ugly.

05:28.537 --> 05:29.709
Triple date.

05:29.704 --> 05:30.921
I guess I have to get

05:30.914 --> 05:33.633
three corsages, but whatever.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.003
You know, it's fine.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.808
Dude, you have, like, three
girlfriends at the same time.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.844
You're like a movie star.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.809
Or a normal guy in France.

05:46.805 --> 05:50.355
I have no idea why these girls
are being so nice to me,

05:50.350 --> 05:53.320
but they asked me
on a date tonight.

05:53.311 --> 05:54.654
To the mall.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.819
And not to the
crapster mall either.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.909
To the Northside Mall.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.575
Whoa, you just
jumped ahead two malls.

06:02.571 --> 06:05.165
On your left.

06:05.156 --> 06:08.080
Bobby, don't forget
about us tonight.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.078
'Kay, Boo-boo Bear?

06:13.540 --> 06:15.918
<i>So, big date tonight, huh?</i>

06:15.917 --> 06:19.342
See what happens when you focus
and don't aim for the top?

06:19.337 --> 06:22.841
Actually, Dad, these are
A-list college-prep girls,

06:23.008 --> 06:24.555
and they're all over me.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.645
In a conversational way.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.263
Really? Huh.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.231
So, what's the name of the girl
you're taking out?

06:30.223 --> 06:31.725
Girls.

06:31.725 --> 06:32.897
Three girls.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.611
I know guys who
are good at sports

06:34.603 --> 06:35.855
who never pulled that off.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.898
Three? How did that happen?

06:37.898 --> 06:41.027
Best as I can figure,
I'm giving something off.

06:47.908 --> 06:48.909
I don't know.

06:48.909 --> 06:49.910
Looks kind of tippy.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.834
Not as tippy as the last five.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.923
I think we got it right
this time.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.259
All right, Bill, let her rip.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.252
It's moving.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.799
It's moving!

07:00.795 --> 07:04.845
Glides effortlessly,
well-balanced.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.184
We pulled it off.

07:06.176 --> 07:07.803
It's not very pretty.

07:07.802 --> 07:08.894
I mean, it's functional,

07:08.887 --> 07:11.106
but personally,
I wouldn't be caught dead

07:11.097 --> 07:14.192
pushing a homeless cart
that looked like that.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.185
Huh.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.357
You're right.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.526
Well, I guess we could
gussy it up a bit.

07:18.521 --> 07:19.613
Bring it on back, Bill.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.619
Well, guys, I'm off to work.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.410
My job is making this day
a special one

07:27.405 --> 07:29.533
for three lucky ladies.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.119
Yeah!

07:33.119 --> 07:34.541
Three-sewer wheelie!

07:34.537 --> 07:35.584
A new record!

07:35.580 --> 07:36.672
Go for four!

07:36.665 --> 07:37.837
Woo-hoo!

07:37.832 --> 07:41.507
Bobby-boy,
you ready to roll?

07:41.503 --> 07:43.096
Just let me get my bike.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.886
Forget it, just hop
on behind Decca.

07:44.881 --> 07:45.848
Behind?

07:46.007 --> 07:47.429
Okay.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.859
Bobby, don't sit back there.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.603
What are you doing? Switch.

07:58.603 --> 07:59.820
Bobby!

07:59.813 --> 08:00.905
Don't worry.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.899
We'll have him home late.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.651
Oh, my God.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.700
My boy is a... a girl.

08:16.579 --> 08:19.583
Are you cooking bacon?

08:19.582 --> 08:20.925
What's wrong, Hank?

08:20.917 --> 08:22.214
Nothing.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.133
I just needed a
little something to...

08:25.880 --> 08:26.802
It's Bobby.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.137
Oh, honey.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.806
This can't still be because

08:29.801 --> 08:32.054
Bobby sat on the back
of a girl's bike.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.895
It's not just that, Peggy.

08:33.888 --> 08:36.812
The girls picked him up.
They decided where to go--

08:36.808 --> 08:38.650
All the stuff Bobby should do.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.863
I, for one, think it is
a step in the right direction.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.570
You and I would have
started dating

08:44.566 --> 08:47.285
a lot earlier if
it would have been acceptable

08:47.277 --> 08:49.905
for me to ask you out.

08:53.116 --> 08:56.461
Well, we finally got to
the bottom of Boomhauer's car.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.080
We thought it was
the starter motor,

08:58.079 --> 08:59.831
but it was actually
the alternator.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.750
You should see it sometime.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.923
I'm not doing anything
Friday night.

09:03.918 --> 09:04.919
Oh, good.

09:04.919 --> 09:06.796
I'll have Boomhauer
drive it over.

09:09.966 --> 09:12.890
I'm all for equal rights
and women wearing pants

09:12.886 --> 09:15.264
and dying in combat
if they want to,

09:15.263 --> 09:18.312
but there's still some things
boys need to do.

09:18.308 --> 09:20.902
Look what the girls
won me at the arcade!

09:20.894 --> 09:23.272
Decca's got quite an arm.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.699
I am still okay with this.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.121
Death blow.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.115
Boom goes the dynamite.

09:34.115 --> 09:37.289
Uh, son, why aren't you
playing the game, too?

09:37.285 --> 09:39.253
There's only three controllers.

09:39.245 --> 09:42.920
Besides, somebody's got to be
the snack-fetching boy.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.010
Bobby, soda.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.127
I'm on it.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.300
Why are you hanging around
with these girls?

09:52.300 --> 09:55.304
I bet you can't even tell me
which one's your girlfriend.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.805
Well, they all are, kind of.

09:56.971 --> 10:00.896
They take turns fussing over me,
combing my hair and stuff.

10:00.892 --> 10:01.893
It's great.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.895
But they don't treat you right.

10:03.895 --> 10:06.569
It doesn't look like they
have much respect for you.

10:06.564 --> 10:07.816
And self-respect, son...

10:09.234 --> 10:11.783
How cute.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.906
They want me to dance
like a monkey.

10:13.905 --> 10:16.909
See, this is the kind of thing
I'm talking about.

10:16.908 --> 10:20.879
Look, Dad, all I know is,
before, I was toast.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.874
And now I'm going to homecoming
with three girls.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.752
So if they want me
to dance like a monkey,

10:26.751 --> 10:29.470
then watch this monkey go!

10:36.302 --> 10:38.851
So, the dance is in two days.

10:39.013 --> 10:41.516
Are we here to pick out
dresses for you girls?

10:41.516 --> 10:43.314
Nope.
Oh.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.903
Well, we need to figure out
what you guys are wearing.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.614
I have a cummerbund
to color-coordinate.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.153
You're so cute, Bobby.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.402
Isn't he?

10:51.401 --> 10:52.493
Given.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.283
But what time
are you picking me up?

10:54.279 --> 10:55.656
Should we get a limo?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.532
I have a lot of questions.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.871
Hey, let's get Bobby pierced!

11:02.036 --> 11:03.913
What?
Even better,

11:03.913 --> 11:04.914
give him a makeover!

11:28.229 --> 11:30.197
I'm uncomfortable.

11:34.903 --> 11:37.372
Okay, Boomhauer, start her up.

11:46.581 --> 11:50.211
Behold, a great moment
in hillbilly science.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.384
Hillbillies discover that
four carts bigger than one.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.722
We did it.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.513
We built the ultimate
homeless guy super-cart.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.306
Dang it.

11:59.302 --> 12:02.181
I can't enjoy it
because my son is out there

12:02.180 --> 12:04.308
dancing like a monkey
for a bunch of girls.

12:04.307 --> 12:05.524
Face it, Hank:

12:05.516 --> 12:06.813
women are getting stronger

12:06.976 --> 12:08.819
and men are growing
more effeminate.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.855
In the future,
both men and women

12:11.022 --> 12:12.865
will visit the gynecologist,

12:13.024 --> 12:16.699
but only women will be getting
their money's worth.

12:16.694 --> 12:20.073
Thanks for letting us borrow
this man meat, Mr. Hill.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.080
Poor Bobby.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.501
It's sad when someone so young
gives up their self-respect.

12:26.496 --> 12:29.750
He's got so much time
left for that.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.468
I gotta get my mind off of this.

12:32.460 --> 12:35.634
Well, I suppose this is
as good a time as any

12:35.630 --> 12:37.758
to figure out the Internet.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.438
Now what do we do with our cart?

12:43.429 --> 12:45.682
Seems a shame to
just dismantle it.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.901
Man, talking 'bout no
dang ol' Spongy, man, I mean,

12:47.892 --> 12:50.611
dang ol' crazy, but man,
you know, he's people, man.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.900
Boomhauer's right.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.318
We should drive this thing
down to the park

12:53.314 --> 12:54.691
and give it to Spongy.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.785
Might be just the thing
that turns him around.

12:56.776 --> 13:00.451
Well, I was thinking
sell it to Spongy, but...

13:00.446 --> 13:03.199
As long as Spongy gets it.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.169
What is going on?

13:07.161 --> 13:08.913
Why don't you ring?!

13:08.913 --> 13:11.086
Now, ring!

13:12.500 --> 13:14.093
Personally, I've never
heard of anyone

13:14.085 --> 13:16.634
not being in the
mood for chicken,

13:16.629 --> 13:19.098
but fine, we'll
just order pizza.

13:19.090 --> 13:20.717
Don't touch it!

13:20.717 --> 13:24.187
Terry and the girls said
they'd call me an hour ago.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.897
Bobby, have you been sitting
like that the whole time?

13:26.889 --> 13:28.687
Ugh, what if they don't call?

13:28.683 --> 13:30.230
I don't know what I'll do!

13:30.226 --> 13:31.899
The dance is tonight!

13:31.894 --> 13:33.441
Just call them.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.406
we call.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.901
Men call and women get called.

13:37.900 --> 13:41.279
Now, Hank, that is
a backwards way of thinking.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.915
Hello?!

13:43.906 --> 13:45.749
Uh-huh, sounds cool!

13:45.742 --> 13:47.289
I am so there!

13:47.285 --> 13:48.912
They're picking me up
in an hour.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.879
I'm a mess.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.089
I have to do my hair!

13:53.291 --> 13:56.886
Hank, this is perfectly
acceptable behav...

13:56.878 --> 13:58.880
Oh, I'm sorry.
I honestly tried.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.427
Have at it.

14:00.423 --> 14:02.050
No. No fixing nothing.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.267
You're grounded.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.353
But... but what about the dance?

14:05.345 --> 14:07.643
You're not going anywhere
near these girls

14:07.638 --> 14:09.561
until you start
acting like a boy.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.730
How am I supposed to do that?

14:11.726 --> 14:13.774
You're just supposed to know!

14:17.565 --> 14:19.818
Psst! Hey!

14:19.817 --> 14:21.194
Boo-boo!

14:24.238 --> 14:25.706
Oh, no!

14:25.698 --> 14:27.871
Sad Popsicle!

14:27.867 --> 14:30.871
Sorry, girls, but my dad said

14:30.870 --> 14:33.669
that I can't go to the
dance with you guys.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.917
Well, we're not going
to the dance anyway.

14:35.917 --> 14:38.261
Yeah, during the
homecoming football game,

14:38.252 --> 14:39.845
there's a secret party
under the bleachers

14:39.837 --> 14:41.885
that only really old
kids know about.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.259
Kids who are like, 16.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.893
Well, my dad is always wishing

14:48.888 --> 14:51.858
I would go to more
football games.

14:58.022 --> 15:01.242
My tiny arms weren't
meant for this.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.862
Go on without me!

15:04.987 --> 15:08.867
No wonder the homeless are...
so thin.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.050
Hey, Hank Hill, I just
saw your hillbilly kid

15:17.041 --> 15:18.634
sneak out with those girls.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.924
I'm surprised they didn't
have to butter the window.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.888
What? But he's grounded.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.598
Well, he's gone now.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.592
They kept talking about
going under the bleachers.

15:26.592 --> 15:27.889
What's that redneck for?

15:27.885 --> 15:29.637
Under the bleachers?!

15:29.637 --> 15:33.562
Oh, no! That's where
kids at risk gather!

15:33.558 --> 15:34.901
I so with you!

15:34.892 --> 15:37.896
I want to see what underbelly
of underbelly look like.

15:40.106 --> 15:43.906
I said, "Dude, I'm not giving
away my car; I'm selling it..."

15:44.902 --> 15:46.870
Okay, lil' squirt...

15:49.323 --> 15:51.121
Come on. Let's go.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.963
Where did I go wrong?

16:03.963 --> 16:07.092
I can't believe Bobby
is under the bleachers.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.764
This is so hilarious!

16:08.759 --> 16:11.433
Leave it to hillbilly children
to think it's cool

16:11.429 --> 16:13.602
to hang out under
100 people's butts.

16:13.598 --> 16:17.478
Can somebody tell me
what's so great about this?

16:17.477 --> 16:21.482
I hear at the dance
there's punch and crepe paper.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.324
It sounds magical.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.168
Okay, this way.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.131
Hey, put that down, mister.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.124
You're not old enough to...

16:40.124 --> 16:41.296
Stay focused!

16:41.292 --> 16:43.010
We here to find your kid.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.846
Let nature and parole officers
take care of the rest.

16:53.137 --> 16:55.560
Oh, my God, there he is!

16:55.556 --> 16:57.524
I can't wait to see his face.

17:03.314 --> 17:04.861
Hey, Spongy!

17:04.857 --> 17:05.904
What?

17:05.900 --> 17:07.902
Man, we got, got
something for you,

17:07.902 --> 17:09.324
right, right here, man.

17:13.281 --> 17:15.159
Voilà!

17:15.159 --> 17:16.411
Your new home.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.881
Uh, yeah, this is great...

17:22.290 --> 17:26.421
If I want to get knifed
or murdered or poo-balled.

17:26.420 --> 17:29.344
Why don't you just paint
a target on my back?

17:30.800 --> 17:32.768
I will take the tarp, though.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.104
Uh...

17:39.100 --> 17:41.819
That was kind of a long walk
getting here.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.905
That stir-fry looks good.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.239
You, you want some?

17:45.231 --> 17:47.233
It's cat food.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.201
Hmm, yeah, okay.

17:54.115 --> 17:55.116
Great band, yeah.

17:55.116 --> 17:57.369
So sad.

17:57.368 --> 18:01.464
They have no idea this is the
highlight of their whole life.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.082
I go tell them.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.843
Why you hitting yourself, sucka?

18:10.006 --> 18:11.303
Bethany, are there gonna be

18:11.299 --> 18:13.768
any cute guys here
who aren't creeps?

18:13.759 --> 18:15.887
I thought we were
gonna meet some guys.

18:15.886 --> 18:16.887
Meet some...

18:16.887 --> 18:18.889
What do you mean,
meet some guys?

18:18.889 --> 18:20.891
I'm your guy right here.

18:20.891 --> 18:22.063
You?

18:22.059 --> 18:23.356
No, Bobby.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.899
I meant like a real guy.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.238
You don't count, Bobby.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.903
Don't tell me you
thought you counted.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.900
But you came and picked me up.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.902
That makes me your date.

18:31.902 --> 18:32.869
Doesn't it?

18:34.905 --> 18:37.249
I thought you girls liked me.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.744
I'm your Boo-boo Bear, remember?

18:39.744 --> 18:43.248
Bobby, you're not really
boyfriend material.

18:43.247 --> 18:46.547
You were just fun to play
around with. That's all.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.919
What?! You mean like

18:47.918 --> 18:49.886
a stuffed animal or something?!

18:49.879 --> 18:51.506
That's not a bad analogy.

18:51.505 --> 18:52.882
Oh.

18:52.882 --> 18:56.307
Well, it was fun
while it lasted.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.679
For you guys.

19:05.895 --> 19:06.862
There you are, Bobby.

19:07.021 --> 19:08.238
Okay, come with me.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.904
We are about to redefine
the word "grounded."

19:10.900 --> 19:12.618
Go ahead and yell at me,

19:12.610 --> 19:14.112
but there's nothing you can say

19:14.111 --> 19:16.864
that could make me feel worse
than I already do.

19:18.616 --> 19:21.165
Is everything all right?

19:21.160 --> 19:23.083
Those girls didn't like me.

19:23.079 --> 19:25.628
I was just some game to them.

19:25.623 --> 19:28.547
Come on. Let's just
go home, Dad.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.508
Evening, ladies.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.553
Man, all three of you are tens,

19:34.548 --> 19:36.596
so, that like, makes you a 30!

19:36.592 --> 19:38.139
Collectively speaking.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.137
You can tell I'm
good at math, right?

19:40.137 --> 19:43.732
In spite of my deceptively
disheveled facade?

19:43.724 --> 19:46.523
What on earth
are you talking about?

19:46.519 --> 19:48.863
Allow me to ensmoothen things.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.240
My name is Randall.

19:51.232 --> 19:54.236
Wait, are those guys
hassling the girls?

19:55.820 --> 19:58.619
Dang it. I gotta go
take care of this.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.833
Bobby, I think I'd
better be the one to...

20:00.825 --> 20:04.875
No, Dad, I'll handle it.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.712
Is everything all
right, gentlemen?

20:08.708 --> 20:10.426
Can I help you?

20:10.418 --> 20:12.637
Oh, easy, little fella.

20:12.628 --> 20:16.804
Look, these girls have been
a huge pain in my behind,

20:16.799 --> 20:19.143
but I can't have you
hassling them.

20:19.135 --> 20:22.856
If you need to beat me up,
so be it.

20:24.515 --> 20:26.893
Girls, while they're
beating on me,

20:26.892 --> 20:28.519
make a break for your bikes.

20:28.519 --> 20:29.816
Wow.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.814
The kid's a noble little dude.

20:31.981 --> 20:32.823
True.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.825
You girls are short-sighted
to overlook

20:34.984 --> 20:36.861
such outstanding sensibilities

20:36.861 --> 20:40.331
in this noble little
dude... and stuff.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.588
Let's go.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.379
I'm walking you out
so that I know that you're safe.

20:50.374 --> 20:54.345
And if there is a door,
I am opening it for you.

20:54.336 --> 20:57.840
Don't think you're so
awesome, Boo-boo Bear.

20:58.007 --> 20:59.554
We were leaving anyway.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.848
Yeah, let's go.

21:06.891 --> 21:10.111
Well, I know these girls
don't appreciate you,

21:10.102 --> 21:12.571
but one day there'll be
a girl who will.

21:12.563 --> 21:15.407
I hope she doesn't keep
me waiting too long.

21:15.399 --> 21:18.243
Bobby, women will always
keep you waiting.

21:18.235 --> 21:20.078
Did you know
it takes your mother

21:20.070 --> 21:22.823
20 minutes to get ready
in the morning?

21:22.823 --> 21:24.825
Eh, women.

21:58.275 --> 22:01.245
<i>Why you hitting
yourself, sucka?</i>
