00:04.917 --> 00:06.667
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:06.750 --> 00:08.625
Who is this little ballerina?

00:08.709 --> 00:12.208
It's Charlie, your fourth
and final child, right?

00:13.667 --> 00:15.208
Isn't that dress adorable?

00:15.250 --> 00:16.709
I bought it for her first ballet class,

00:16.792 --> 00:18.917
which you are taking her to,
because I have to work tomorrow.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.917
But, honey, I'm supposed
to... I'd be happy to.

00:23.959 --> 00:25.417
And I need you to videotape it,

00:25.500 --> 00:27.959
- because I don't want to miss a thing.
- But the camera I...

00:28.375 --> 00:29.792
I'd be happy to.

00:31.250 --> 00:33.834
Ballet... what a stupid thing to do.

00:34.166 --> 00:36.250
Actually, your father took ballet
in high school.

00:37.417 --> 00:38.750
Great.

00:39.417 --> 00:41.083
Another image to keep me up at night.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.959
Actually, our football coach
thought that taking ballet

00:45.041 --> 00:46.625
would help our agility and balance.

00:47.458 --> 00:49.834
Either that or he was just
really messing with us.

00:50.542 --> 00:53.250
You should've seen your dad in his tights.
He looked hot.

00:54.083 --> 00:55.750
Yeah, the whole idea of "hot"

00:55.834 --> 00:57.834
must've been different in the olden days.

- Uh, Mr. Piper, can I talk to you-
- Hold on.

02:07.875 --> 02:09.083
- See, it'll just...
- Eh!

02:10.583 --> 02:12.750
Now what is it?

02:12.834 --> 02:14.959
Oh, well, you're gonna laugh
when you hear this,

02:15.041 --> 02:17.250
but you actually made a mistake.

02:20.166 --> 02:22.583
So this is where you'd be laughing.

02:24.208 --> 02:25.792
Anyways, um,

02:25.875 --> 02:28.542
see, this answer here?
You marked it wrong.

02:28.625 --> 02:31.458
- It is wrong.
- But the correct answer is "B".

02:31.542 --> 02:35.583
Yes, but you did not completely
shade in the oval next to the "B."

02:35.667 --> 02:37.041
So, it is wrong.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.709
You're kidding, right?

02:40.041 --> 02:43.166
Miss Duncan, I haven't kidded since...

02:44.834 --> 02:46.083
I've never kidded.

02:49.667 --> 02:51.041
Good to know. Um...

02:51.125 --> 02:53.250
So you're gonna, you're gonna
change my grade, right?

02:53.375 --> 02:55.875
- No, I'm not.
- But that's not fair.

02:56.125 --> 02:58.834
This is me completely shading in

02:58.917 --> 03:01.458
the oval next to "I don't care."

03:02.583 --> 03:04.542
But, uh, that's, that's...

03:05.458 --> 03:06.500
Hmm?

03:14.125 --> 03:17.875
There she is. Happy one-week-aversary.

03:17.959 --> 03:19.542
Oh, PJ, you remembered.

03:19.625 --> 03:21.417
Yeah, and they said it wouldn't last.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.291
They did? Who are they?

03:25.291 --> 03:27.125
No, it's just an expression.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.959
Wow. It's so fun going out
with a smart guy.

03:33.959 --> 03:37.041
- I wrote a poem for you.
- Oh, let me see.

03:38.542 --> 03:40.667
"P is for the way you play guitar,

03:40.750 --> 03:42.542
J is for the jokes you tell."

03:42.625 --> 03:44.166
Oh, that's beautiful.

03:45.375 --> 03:47.750
Yeah, the hard part
was getting it to rhyme,

03:47.834 --> 03:48.959
so I didn't.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.542
Oh, oh, I have a gift for you too.

03:55.333 --> 03:56.959
- A necklace?
- Yeah.

03:57.959 --> 04:00.750
- What's this?
- It's a piece of churro.

04:01.250 --> 04:04.166
It is the last bite of the first snack
we ever shared.

04:04.583 --> 04:07.375
Oh, that makes me so happy.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.041
Now I'm sad.

04:12.125 --> 04:13.542
What's wrong?

04:13.959 --> 04:16.458
Oh, PJ, you know me so well.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.667
Something is wrong.

04:20.959 --> 04:24.208
My ex-boyfriend keeps texting me.
He wants to get back together.

04:24.375 --> 04:27.792
You're wearing my churro.
We're at the churro stage.

04:27.875 --> 04:30.333
Well, I'll talk to this guy,

04:30.417 --> 04:32.000
- set him straight.
- Would you?

04:32.083 --> 04:34.458
- Yeah. Who is he?
- His name's Brock

04:34.542 --> 04:36.333
and he's captain of the wrestling team.

04:36.417 --> 04:38.875
He thinks he's so great
just 'cause he's undefeated.

04:38.959 --> 04:41.750
Huh. So he's never lost a fight

04:41.834 --> 04:43.375
and I've never been in a fight.

04:43.709 --> 04:46.166
Huh. We should have lots to talk about.

04:48.250 --> 04:49.625
- See ya.
- See ya.

04:52.291 --> 04:54.500
Man, the churro stage is complicated.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.250
- Hello.
- Hi.

05:02.333 --> 05:04.417
Mom, could you sign this, please?

05:04.500 --> 05:05.875
- Sure, honey.
- Wait a second.

05:05.959 --> 05:08.208
I know that move. She's hiding something.

05:10.500 --> 05:13.041
- No, I'm not.
- Then move your hand away.

05:14.291 --> 05:15.834
I don't want to.

05:19.542 --> 05:21.250
A disciplinary notice?

05:22.250 --> 05:24.000
Yes! I knew it!

05:24.083 --> 05:26.959
Finally, Little Miss Perfect
did something bad.

05:27.041 --> 05:28.583
Okay, Teddy, honey, what did you do?

05:28.667 --> 05:31.375
What? Nothing. I just got mad at a teacher

05:31.458 --> 05:35.083
because he lowered my grade
for not filling in a stupid oval,

05:35.166 --> 05:38.417
so I snapped one of his stupid pencils.

05:40.834 --> 05:41.875
That's it?

05:42.458 --> 05:44.750
I've waited my whole life for that?

05:45.667 --> 05:48.208
Teddy, honey, I'm not hearing
that you did anything wrong.

05:48.250 --> 05:49.792
Well, that's because I didn't.

05:49.875 --> 05:51.917
Okay, I'll tell you what.
Maybe I should go down

05:52.000 --> 05:53.375
and have a little talk with this guy.

05:53.458 --> 05:56.500
- Oh, no, no, no, please don't.
- Why not?

05:56.583 --> 05:58.583
Well, because whenever you get involved

05:58.667 --> 06:00.792
in stuff like this, you turn into...

06:00.875 --> 06:02.375
- Mama Bear?
- Mm-hmm.

06:02.458 --> 06:04.458
Is that what you're worried about?

06:04.542 --> 06:05.709
Yes.

06:07.291 --> 06:09.291
Because whenever Mama Bear
comes out of her cave,

06:09.375 --> 06:10.834
bad things happen.

06:11.333 --> 06:12.959
Yeah, but they're usually entertaining.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.000
Teddy, honey, I am more than
capable of going down there

06:18.083 --> 06:20.083
and having a civilized discussion.

06:20.166 --> 06:21.917
Now who is this teacher?

06:22.500 --> 06:23.500
Mr. Piper.

06:23.583 --> 06:24.834
Ah-ha. Piper. Figures.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.333
Yeah, PJ had him. Gave him an "F"

06:26.417 --> 06:28.041
- when he clearly deserved a "D minus."
- Ooh.

06:28.375 --> 06:30.792
Can you please just promise me
you won't get involved?

06:30.875 --> 06:33.792
Okay, if it's that important
to you, I'll stay out of it.

06:33.875 --> 06:36.250
Mama Bear is going into hibernation.

06:36.667 --> 06:40.750
Well... Oh!
Great, she forgot to sign this.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.583
Here, let me have it.
I've got her signature down.

06:52.291 --> 06:53.834
Bob: Okay. Come on, Charlie.

06:53.917 --> 06:57.000
Come on. Spin. Spin.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.625
Come on, twirl around.

06:59.458 --> 07:01.041
Well, do something cute.

07:04.709 --> 07:06.667
And that's why we need the lessons.

07:07.667 --> 07:10.083
People. People.

07:10.166 --> 07:13.250
Welcome to Miss Donna's school of ballet.

07:13.417 --> 07:16.417
I'm Miss Donna, and I am passionate

07:16.500 --> 07:18.583
about teaching the art of ballet

07:18.667 --> 07:21.583
to the next generation of ballerinas.

07:22.667 --> 07:24.166
Did I get everyone's check?

07:26.625 --> 07:30.291
Very good. Now so the magic can begin,

07:30.375 --> 07:33.083
will the parents please
exit to the hallway?

07:34.250 --> 07:36.917
And there's no peeking in the window.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.333
It distracts the children.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.917
Um, um, Miss... Miss Donna?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.333
- Yes?
- Hi, Bob Duncan.

07:44.417 --> 07:47.458
Listen, I promised my wife
I'd videotape the class.

07:47.542 --> 07:49.709
Well, I'm sure a giant man

07:49.792 --> 07:52.750
with a shiny camera
won't distract the children.

07:54.041 --> 07:57.333
Okay, um, look,
if I don't get this on tape,

07:57.458 --> 07:59.166
I'm in really big trouble.

07:59.250 --> 08:01.792
It's not my problem
you're afraid of your wife.

08:02.792 --> 08:05.750
Okay, I am not afraid.

08:05.834 --> 08:08.083
I just have a very healthy respect.

08:10.333 --> 08:11.792
Miss Donna: All right, children,

08:11.875 --> 08:14.625
the first piece we're going to learn today

08:14.709 --> 08:17.792
is called "A Dance To Spring."

08:17.875 --> 08:19.667
If anyone needs to make a doody,

08:19.750 --> 08:21.917
please raise your hand.

08:22.333 --> 08:23.333
Daddy.

08:23.375 --> 08:27.417
- No, dear, I said "doody."
- Daddy.

08:43.041 --> 08:45.458
Um, Mr. Piper.

08:45.542 --> 08:49.041
Hi, I'm Amy Duncan, Teddy's mom.

08:49.125 --> 08:50.917
Ah. Teddy Duncan.

08:51.166 --> 08:52.709
She's one of my most...

08:53.875 --> 08:55.083
students.

08:56.333 --> 08:57.792
Right. Um, anyway,

08:57.875 --> 09:00.000
I wanted to talk to you
about her last quiz.

09:00.083 --> 09:03.834
Mrs. Duncan, parents must
schedule an appointment

09:03.917 --> 09:05.500
for any conference.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.208
Right, and I am so sorry,

09:07.250 --> 09:09.083
but I'm here now during my lunch hour,

09:09.166 --> 09:10.792
so if you could just make an exception.

09:10.875 --> 09:12.417
Oh, let me check over here

09:12.542 --> 09:14.333
where I posted the special rules

09:14.417 --> 09:16.000
that apply only to you.

09:16.792 --> 09:19.125
Oh, look, they don't exist.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.250
At any rate, as you can see by my desk,

09:21.417 --> 09:23.709
I am far too busy right now.

09:24.291 --> 09:25.959
Oh, okay.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.792
Mama Bear just cleared your schedule.

09:40.792 --> 09:43.333
Hey, Gabe, uh, do me a favor...

09:43.417 --> 09:45.000
Listen to this and tell me what you think.

09:45.083 --> 09:47.041
- What is it?
- Uh, well, I've gotta talk

09:47.125 --> 09:49.208
to Skyler's ex-boyfriend
and tell him to quit bothering her.

09:49.250 --> 09:51.166
Okay, let me stop you right there.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.792
- Go, go, go, go.
- What?

09:56.875 --> 10:00.250
Oh, I just wanted to stop you.
I'm not interested.

10:00.583 --> 10:02.250
Okay, this is what
I'm thinking about saying.

10:03.083 --> 10:05.291
"Hello, Brock, you don't know me,"

10:05.375 --> 10:07.375
but I've heard a lot
of great things about you.

10:08.166 --> 10:09.500
If it isn't too much trouble,

10:09.583 --> 10:12.250
could you please maybe stop
texting Skyler so much?"

10:12.333 --> 10:14.959
Are you trying to tell him off
or invite him to the prom?

10:16.750 --> 10:19.375
Tell him off... Nicely.

10:19.458 --> 10:21.875
So he won't get all punchy
and hurty on me.

10:21.959 --> 10:23.959
Then you've gotta be confident!

10:24.041 --> 10:26.375
- Show him you mean business.
- Oh, no.

10:26.500 --> 10:30.625
- What are you afraid of?
- Well, clowns, spiders, the dark...

10:30.709 --> 10:32.250
No, I mean with Brock.

10:32.333 --> 10:34.709
He's the captain of the wrestling team.

10:34.792 --> 10:37.333
Trust me... all tough guys are the same.

10:37.417 --> 10:40.208
You stand up to them,
they'll always back down.

10:40.250 --> 10:42.041
- All right, I'll... I'll try it.
- Yeah.

10:42.125 --> 10:43.750
- Okay.
- Yeah.

10:45.542 --> 10:46.625
Brock.

10:47.333 --> 10:49.375
This is PJ. Uh...

10:50.208 --> 10:52.083
Skyler is my girlfriend now

10:52.166 --> 10:54.583
and I want you to stop bothering her.

10:56.125 --> 10:59.375
Uh-huh. Works for me. Okay. Bye.

11:01.208 --> 11:02.458
He wants to meet after school.

11:03.125 --> 11:05.041
- To do what?
- I'm guessing homework.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.125
He said he was gonna teach me a lesson.

11:14.375 --> 11:16.834
Hi, uh, you wanted to see me,
Principal Hibbert?

11:16.917 --> 11:18.959
Yes, Teddy, have a seat.

11:20.542 --> 11:23.083
I want to show you something

11:23.417 --> 11:26.000
our security cameras caught earlier today.

11:26.417 --> 11:28.417
I think you'll find it interesting.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.500
Can we see what else is on?

11:34.834 --> 11:36.208
Shh, shh, shh!

11:36.542 --> 11:38.583
Here's my favorite part.

11:50.875 --> 11:54.041
- Why... why is it in fast motion?
- It's funnier that way.

11:57.959 --> 12:00.041
I... I don't know what to say.

12:00.125 --> 12:01.709
There's good news and bad news.

12:02.166 --> 12:04.959
Mr. Piper has agreed not to press charges,

12:05.500 --> 12:08.417
but your mother is banned from campus.

12:09.333 --> 12:10.583
What's the bad news?

12:12.667 --> 12:15.083
Mr. Piper is demanding an apology.

12:15.166 --> 12:16.750
Oh. Oh, okay, okay.

12:16.834 --> 12:19.333
Well, I'll say sorry to him
the next time I see him.

12:19.417 --> 12:21.417
Not from you.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.000
Ooh, there's the bad news.

12:34.542 --> 12:37.709
Hey, honey, how was Charlie's
first ballet class?

12:37.792 --> 12:39.709
Okay, you're not gonna like this,

12:39.792 --> 12:42.417
but Charlie got kicked out of class
because I was videotaping.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.250
But I'm gonna fix it,
so please don't yell at me.

12:46.250 --> 12:47.166
Okay.

12:48.458 --> 12:49.458
Cupcake?

12:52.208 --> 12:53.333
Cupcake?

12:56.875 --> 12:59.041
That's it? You're not mad?

12:59.125 --> 13:01.000
No! I'm not mad.

13:01.083 --> 13:04.875
Honey, everybody in this family
has to learn to be very forgiving people.

13:07.834 --> 13:09.417
What'd you do?

13:11.208 --> 13:12.208
Nothing.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.500
Teddy: Mom!

13:13.583 --> 13:16.166
Ooh, I think we're gonna find out
what "nothing" means.

13:17.125 --> 13:18.834
What's up, sweetie?

13:18.917 --> 13:21.375
I just saw the most
interesting nature film...

13:21.458 --> 13:22.583
- Mmm?
- ...in school today.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.500
Yeah, it was about a Mama Bear

13:24.583 --> 13:27.500
that wandered into a classroom
and chased a teacher.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.667
That's nice, dear. Cupcake?

13:31.750 --> 13:35.166
No. No, cupcakes only work on Dad.

13:35.917 --> 13:36.959
It's true.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.750
Mr. Piper is coming over tomorrow night

13:42.875 --> 13:44.667
and you will apologize to him.

13:44.750 --> 13:46.834
Fine, I'll apologize.

13:46.917 --> 13:49.333
I guess I got a little bit out of control.

13:49.417 --> 13:52.458
I don't know why I do it.
I just lose it sometimes.

13:53.959 --> 13:56.083
Did you see the part where
I chased him around the janitor?

13:56.166 --> 13:57.917
You have to admit
that was a little funny, right?

14:00.250 --> 14:01.500
Maybe a little.

14:07.959 --> 14:08.959
Miss Donna?

14:23.375 --> 14:25.208
- Oh, Mr. Duncan.
- Oh!

14:25.291 --> 14:28.250
Hey, hey. Hi. Huh.

14:28.333 --> 14:30.917
Miss Donna, you know, I was just...

14:31.000 --> 14:33.834
Demonstrating a well-executed plié.

14:33.917 --> 14:36.083
You have some ballet experience?

14:36.166 --> 14:38.291
Oh, it was a long time ago. I don't, uh...

14:38.375 --> 14:39.583
First position!

14:40.208 --> 14:41.542
Second position.

14:42.250 --> 14:44.250
Attitude.

14:47.583 --> 14:50.166
Now give me two grand jetés!

14:50.250 --> 14:52.500
Oh, no, no, no.

14:52.583 --> 14:53.625
Oh, all right.

14:56.291 --> 14:58.333
Very impressive.

14:58.709 --> 15:00.375
Thank you, thank you, but really I'm...

15:00.458 --> 15:03.709
I'm here 'cause I'm hoping that you'll
let Charlie back in the dance class.

15:03.792 --> 15:06.875
Well, I will if you'll help me
with something.

15:06.959 --> 15:10.709
I'm doing some choreography
for one of my advanced classes.

15:10.792 --> 15:13.875
Now I'm going to do
a stag leap into your arms.

15:13.959 --> 15:15.041
Lift me high

15:15.125 --> 15:18.458
and then release me gently onto the floor.

15:19.500 --> 15:22.375
You know, I... I only had,
like, three classes.

15:22.542 --> 15:24.000
Bob: Oh, boy!

15:29.583 --> 15:31.375
Miss Donna, are you okay?

15:31.458 --> 15:33.333
My head's in a wall.

15:34.125 --> 15:36.125
Uh, listen, about the Charlie thing,

15:36.625 --> 15:37.667
how are we feeling?

15:44.250 --> 15:47.166
- What's going on?
- Okay, so I gave you a little bad advice

15:47.250 --> 15:50.625
about Skyler's old boyfriend
and now I'm gonna make up for it.

15:53.792 --> 15:55.458
You bought me a ninja?

15:56.458 --> 16:00.542
- Dude.
- This is Matt, my karate teacher.

16:00.625 --> 16:02.500
- Oh. Hey.
- How you doing?

16:02.583 --> 16:03.667
Oh!

16:06.583 --> 16:09.333
Matt's made me the most feared kid
in the third grade.

16:09.417 --> 16:12.041
- You're in fifth grade.
- Hey, one grade at a time.

16:13.458 --> 16:15.792
Anyway, Matt's gonna help you win
your fight tomorrow.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.208
All right, PJ, let's see what you've got.

16:18.250 --> 16:19.500
Come at me, all right?

16:19.583 --> 16:21.375
I want you to punch, hit, kick.

16:21.458 --> 16:22.834
I don't... I don't want to hurt you.

16:22.917 --> 16:24.250
That's the whole point of this suit.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.917
You wearing this, can't feel a thing.

16:28.625 --> 16:31.625
Really? Then I have a better idea.

16:33.625 --> 16:34.875
How you doing?

16:35.417 --> 16:36.750
You PJ?

16:39.500 --> 16:42.375
You... Wait. You're Brock,

16:42.458 --> 16:44.750
the captain of the wrestling team?

16:44.834 --> 16:48.166
My coach says I'm 98 pounds
of white-hot fury.

16:49.542 --> 16:50.625
What's with the outfit?

16:51.041 --> 16:52.375
It's a self-defense suit.

16:52.875 --> 16:54.375
Fine by me.

16:54.709 --> 16:56.166
Oh, wait. Oh...

16:57.834 --> 16:58.750
Okay.

17:09.667 --> 17:11.166
We'll take a water break.

17:11.250 --> 17:13.875
No. Not until I'm done
teaching you a lesson.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.041
Forget it.

17:25.750 --> 17:28.542
I can't beat you up.
I can't get Skyler back.

17:28.834 --> 17:30.959
I can't wear skinny jeans
'cause they're too baggy.

17:34.125 --> 17:36.709
Man, I know it stinks
to get your heart broken,

17:37.375 --> 17:39.959
especially by someone
as beautiful and smart as Skyler.

17:40.125 --> 17:41.875
Well, beautiful.

17:43.834 --> 17:45.750
But you know,
fighting never solved anything.

17:45.834 --> 17:48.667
Yeah, I've really gotta work
on my people skills.

17:50.041 --> 17:51.500
You'll find someone else.

17:52.458 --> 17:53.917
Plenty of fish in the sea.

17:55.166 --> 17:58.291
Well, there is this one other girl
I kinda have a crush on.

17:58.375 --> 18:00.083
- Who?
- Teddy Duncan.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.542
Do you know her?

18:01.667 --> 18:02.917
As a matter of fact, I do,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.792
and I happen to know
she is totally available.

18:10.208 --> 18:12.917
Oh, there's Mr. Piper.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.333
Now, Mom, you promised you'd be good.

18:15.417 --> 18:17.375
Mama Bear has been declawed.

18:17.458 --> 18:20.208
- Open the door.
- Here we go.

18:22.125 --> 18:24.709
Ah. Mr. Piper, come on in.

18:25.917 --> 18:29.375
Ah. Wonderful. You remember my mom?

18:29.458 --> 18:31.667
Every time I close my eyes.

18:33.667 --> 18:34.834
Mom.

18:35.750 --> 18:38.250
Wasn't there something
you wanted to say to Mr. Piper?

18:39.166 --> 18:41.125
I'm sorry.

18:41.750 --> 18:42.792
For?

18:46.709 --> 18:48.875
Swiping everything off your desk.

18:48.959 --> 18:50.041
And?

18:50.125 --> 18:52.083
Chasing you through the hallway.

18:52.166 --> 18:54.083
- While?
- You screamed like a little girl.

18:54.166 --> 18:55.667
Okay!

18:56.917 --> 18:59.250
Good enough. All right, who's hungry?

19:00.083 --> 19:01.542
Oh, Dad, there you are.

19:01.625 --> 19:03.583
Mom, why don't you go check on dinner

19:03.667 --> 19:05.166
without saying anything else?

19:06.834 --> 19:08.959
- Bob Duncan.
- Peter Piper.

19:12.125 --> 19:13.291
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

19:13.375 --> 19:15.333
He's not kidding. Never has, never will.

19:17.291 --> 19:20.458
So, Bob, what do you do for a living?

19:20.542 --> 19:21.792
I'm an exterminator.

19:22.834 --> 19:25.333
The irony. You spend all day
getting rid of pests,

19:25.417 --> 19:27.417
then you come home
to the biggest one of all.

19:29.667 --> 19:30.834
Crudités?

19:33.458 --> 19:35.542
- You talking about my wife?
- Crudités?

19:38.041 --> 19:39.458
You know, Peter Piper,

19:40.000 --> 19:41.542
you're gonna be picking
your pickled peppers

19:41.625 --> 19:43.417
- out of the other side of your...
- Dad!

19:44.250 --> 19:47.125
- Are you threatening me?
- Oh, this is just the appetizers, people.

19:47.208 --> 19:48.709
Let's pace ourselves.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.917
Just say you're sorry.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.583
All right.

19:54.667 --> 19:56.667
I'm sorry you married a lunatic.

19:56.750 --> 19:58.000
That's it.

19:58.625 --> 20:01.125
Oh, no! It's happening again!

20:01.458 --> 20:03.125
Mini-quiche?

20:04.667 --> 20:07.166
Hey! Come back here, you little weasel!

20:07.250 --> 20:09.250
You're crazier than your wife!

20:11.667 --> 20:14.959
Hey! No one's crazier than my wife!

20:16.083 --> 20:18.875
Yeah! No one's crazier than me!

20:19.834 --> 20:21.083
See you in class!

20:24.875 --> 20:26.250
All: Hi, Mrs. Dabney.

20:33.166 --> 20:36.458
Hey, Charlie. So we're here at
your very first ballet recital

20:36.542 --> 20:38.125
and I'm gonna get the whole thing on tape.

20:38.208 --> 20:39.959
Ooh.

20:40.959 --> 20:41.917
That's odd.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.625
Some guy named Brock just asked me out.

20:45.125 --> 20:46.542
I wonder who he is.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.375
No idea.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.125
Ooh, it's starting.

20:53.291 --> 20:57.083
Welcome, everyone,
to Miss Donna's school of dance.

20:57.500 --> 21:00.250
In this performance,
the role of Miss Donna

21:00.333 --> 21:02.125
will be played by Bob Duncan.

21:02.208 --> 21:04.041
Whoo!

21:04.250 --> 21:05.625
Without further ado,

21:05.709 --> 21:07.917
a flower is born.

21:23.875 --> 21:25.875
Hey! Hey!

21:25.959 --> 21:28.000
Hey, hey, hey!

21:28.083 --> 21:31.208
Come on, I'm a friendly flower.
I'm a friendly flower...

21:31.291 --> 21:33.375
Hey! I'm friendly!

21:34.583 --> 21:35.959
Don't run!

21:36.458 --> 21:39.875
- Ooh! That was a very short recital.
- It was awesome!

21:39.959 --> 21:41.458
It was like a monster movie.

21:42.583 --> 21:45.625
I... I said no videotaping in here.

21:45.709 --> 21:49.125
Well, I just have to say really quick...
Good luck, Charlie!

21:54.834 --> 21:56.417
Okay, are you ready?

21:56.500 --> 21:57.709
I don't know, Dad.

21:58.375 --> 22:00.458
Teddy, would you trust me?
I know what I'm doing.

22:00.542 --> 22:02.208
Heard those words before.

22:02.291 --> 22:03.750
Well, this time...

22:04.959 --> 22:06.625
This time I mean it.

22:08.542 --> 22:11.000
All right, here we go.

22:19.458 --> 22:21.834
Man! I gotta work on my technique.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.709
All: Ya think?
