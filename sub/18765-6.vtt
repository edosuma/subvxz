WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.570
Previously on Grimm...

00:03.680 --> 00:05.600
I keep thinking I need
to be carrying that stick.

00:05.760 --> 00:07.683
And I wanna know what's
written on that cloth

00:07.760 --> 00:09.046
that's wrapped around it.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.201
Ah!

00:11.160 --> 00:12.446
Eve is here.

00:12.560 --> 00:13.766
What? Where?

00:13.880 --> 00:15.166
In the wall.

00:15.240 --> 00:16.685
She was drawing, too.

00:16.920 --> 00:17.920
You did this?

00:17.960 --> 00:19.928
I think it's connected
to what healed us.

00:20.160 --> 00:23.164
Well, this is a surprise.
There is a third heartbeat.

00:24.280 --> 00:25.327
I'm being haunted.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.124
Were you
responsible for the death?

00:27.240 --> 00:28.844
In a way.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.408
A mind is a terrible
thing to lose.

00:57.680 --> 01:00.490
Hey, Dan. Just try and
keep it down in your room.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.085
I'm tired of getting calls.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.650
You hear me?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.651
You hear me, Dan? No more calls!

01:11.440 --> 01:12.441
Hey!

01:12.960 --> 01:14.485
You did it again.

01:14.560 --> 01:17.245
People are trying
to sleep here, Dan.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.091
You know, you keep this up,

01:19.160 --> 01:21.766
and you're gonna end up
back out on the street!

01:29.720 --> 01:31.563
What are you
looking at, old man?

04:24.800 --> 04:26.290
Didn't mean to wake you.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.409
I don't sleep that much anyway.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.604
Do you remember
why you did this?

04:30.880 --> 04:32.644
I just remember I had to.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.524
Diana could see it, too.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.890
Yeah, Diana could see more symbols
on the cloth than I could.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.283
This has got to be
related to the stick.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.160
You think the seven Grimm
Crusaders knew what they had?

04:44.120 --> 04:45.963
It's probably
why they buried it.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.122
The answers must be
right in front of us.

05:05.440 --> 05:06.441
No!

05:09.240 --> 05:14.690
No, no, no, not again! Not again.
This is impossible!

05:21.920 --> 05:23.570
It's impossible!
It's impossible!

05:23.760 --> 05:26.843
I warned you, Dan! I told
you what would happen!

05:33.520 --> 05:36.285
I didn't... It's just...
I knew it was...

05:36.440 --> 05:37.965
It had to be the door.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.605
It had to be the door!

05:39.640 --> 05:41.216
There's no other way, right?
Excuse me. Be right back.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.766
I mean, there is no other way!
Hey, sir. Excuse me.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.576
I'm such an idiot. I should've
nailed the door shut.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.443
I should... What... Hey, sir!

05:48.920 --> 05:50.331
Do you need help?

05:50.760 --> 05:52.842
Is there someone
I can call for you?

05:53.120 --> 05:54.610
Listen, it's gonna be okay.

05:54.680 --> 05:56.887
I work at a shelter.
I could take you there.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.970
You can get a warm
meal and some sleep.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.964
You want me to sleep?

06:03.120 --> 06:04.804
I want you to be safe.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.281
It's you. Isn't it?

06:07.400 --> 06:08.447
What?

06:08.760 --> 06:10.922
How did you get into my room?
Your room?

06:11.040 --> 06:12.656
How did you get into my room?
What are you doing?

06:12.680 --> 06:15.411
How? How? How?

06:33.880 --> 06:35.484
First time
we translated the cloth,

06:35.560 --> 06:38.643
at least there were letters
with recognizable Latin roots.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.684
And only two words.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.683
You carved all this
into the walls?

06:42.920 --> 06:44.126
Yes.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.846
Okay, I think this one
is Sumerian.

06:47.320 --> 06:51.006
And this one is Aztec...
I mean, Mayan.

06:51.640 --> 06:53.856
Some of these don't have any
correlation to ancient texts.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.564
No, but it is some
kind of language.

06:55.800 --> 06:56.926
Or languages.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.571
Yeah, if you speak Hodge-podge.

06:59.920 --> 07:04.084
This appears to be alphabetic,
logographic, symbolic, syllabic.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.970
I mean, we need our own Rosetta
Stone to crack this mess.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.089
It has to mean something.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.360
Wait a minute.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.803
I think I know this...

07:17.360 --> 07:18.361
Seven.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.286
It's ancient.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.125
Seven stars!

07:22.280 --> 07:23.805
It's got to be the Pleiades.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.001
The constellation.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.206
Yeah, the Pleiades

07:26.280 --> 07:28.248
was a cluster of seven stars

07:28.320 --> 07:29.321
that held significance

07:29.400 --> 07:30.401
for literally every

07:30.480 --> 07:31.816
ancient civilization
you can think of.

07:31.840 --> 07:32.841
The Aztecs, the Celts,

07:32.920 --> 07:33.921
the Greeks, obviously.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.889
It's usually associated
with times of mourning.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.287
Like, sunrise "morning"?

07:37.360 --> 07:39.601
No, no. Dead "mourning," as in,

07:39.720 --> 07:41.882
you know, cemeteries,
Halloween, Day of the Dead.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.291
The reason we hold festivals

07:43.400 --> 07:45.289
celebrating the dead in the fall

07:45.400 --> 07:47.050
is because, between
the autumnal equinox

07:47.120 --> 07:48.121
and the winter solstice,

07:48.200 --> 07:51.761
these seven stars
rise as the sun sets.

07:52.040 --> 07:55.362
Seven stars,
seven Grimm Crusaders.

07:55.440 --> 07:56.487
Seven keys.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.800
Lucky seven!

07:57.880 --> 08:00.326
Except, I mean, maybe
not so much in this case.

08:00.800 --> 08:01.920
You know, when I was a teen,

08:02.000 --> 08:03.960
I used to wish upon the
first star I saw at night.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.406
What did you wish for?

08:05.640 --> 08:07.927
Oh, a way out of
my messed-up life.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.402
Well, I think
we all wished for that.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.286
Didn't do much good, did it?

08:12.400 --> 08:14.004
Nope. Not really.

08:14.080 --> 08:17.402
Well, except for that last wish.
That one came true.

08:21.760 --> 08:25.162
So we have exactly one symbol

08:25.240 --> 08:26.241
that we recognize.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.603
I wouldn't call that
much of a translation.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.331
It's a start.

08:34.480 --> 08:37.131
So how's it going
with the new roommate?

08:37.960 --> 08:39.291
A little strange.

08:39.360 --> 08:40.600
I can imagine.

08:40.679 --> 08:42.886
That is not what
I'm talking about.

08:44.760 --> 08:47.684
She, uh... She drew
this in the tunnels.

08:53.240 --> 08:54.651
Eve drew this?

08:55.080 --> 08:57.082
Scratched it into
the wall and ceiling

08:57.160 --> 08:58.650
while in some kind of trance.

09:00.720 --> 09:03.564
Yeah, that's kind of strange.
She say why she did that?

09:03.640 --> 09:05.722
She only sort of
remembers doing it.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.283
I showed Monroe and Rosalee.

09:08.800 --> 09:12.043
Monroe said this one is
the constellation Pleiades.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.961
And what is it? Some kind
of map of the universe?

09:15.280 --> 09:17.965
That's one possibility.

09:18.560 --> 09:19.686
Wu.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.640
Yeah, we're at the precinct.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.400
Northwest Park and Couch.
Got it.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.130
Yeah, we'll be there.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.770
Got a fun one.

09:27.840 --> 09:29.080
Someone woke up in a bad mood,

09:29.160 --> 09:30.844
smashed a guy's head
into the pavement.

09:32.040 --> 09:33.451
You're happy about this?

09:33.640 --> 09:36.086
No, but I'll take
a cold-blooded murder

09:36.160 --> 09:39.164
over an unsolvable ancient riddle
about the universe any day.

09:39.840 --> 09:43.322
The only big bang theory I wanna
deal with is the one from a gun.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.241
Who's our Vic?

09:47.320 --> 09:49.049
The winner for Good
Samaritan of the Year.

09:49.200 --> 09:52.443
Michael Sobek, 34, volunteers
at a nearby shelter.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.885
Eye-witnesses say
he was attempting

09:53.960 --> 09:55.371
to help a man in distress,

09:55.440 --> 09:57.568
screaming that someone
was trying to kill him.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.804
The screamer attacked Mr. Sobek

09:59.880 --> 10:02.247
and did, well, that.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.005
We know anything
about our killer?

10:08.080 --> 10:11.527
Fled the scene on foot. Uh, perp
was described as white male,

10:11.600 --> 10:13.921
late 30s, early 40s,
slender, disheveled,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.162
wearing only a white tank
and boxer shorts.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.571
Any idea which way he went?

10:17.640 --> 10:18.971
One of the witnesses
followed him

10:19.040 --> 10:20.336
around the block
and down the street,

10:20.360 --> 10:21.646
but lost him in the traffic.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.051
We set up a ten-block perimeter.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.176
Did he have any weapons on him?

10:24.200 --> 10:25.406
None reported.

10:25.520 --> 10:27.090
Witnesses say it
was all by hand.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.481
We just got a call.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.164
A man matching the
suspect's description

10:30.280 --> 10:31.884
was seen entering
the Englewood Hotel.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.564
I know it. Four blocks over.

10:46.920 --> 10:48.649
Oh, hey, I was just about
to call you guys.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.560
Anybody walk through here just wearing
underwear in the last 15 minutes?

10:51.680 --> 10:53.444
That would be Dan. He's a mess.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.010
Dan have a last name?
Yeah, Wells.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.809
He just came in
screaming about something,

10:56.880 --> 10:58.496
ran upstairs to his room,
and locked the door.

10:58.520 --> 10:59.520
What's his room number?

10:59.560 --> 11:01.005
308. How many rooms
on that floor?

11:01.080 --> 11:02.161
Um, ten.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.242
How many occupied? All of them!

11:04.360 --> 11:06.647
But the guests aren't in
at this time of day.

11:06.720 --> 11:07.767
The hell's going on?

11:07.840 --> 11:08.841
Sounds like hammering.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.325
Hey, are you the police?

11:11.440 --> 11:15.047
Oh, thank God someone finally called you.
That man never sleeps!

11:15.120 --> 11:17.440
Ma'am, you need to get in your
apartment and lock the door.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.005
Ooh, what's happening?
Now, ma'am.

11:22.960 --> 11:27.124
Dan Wells, Portland PD! We're
gonna need you to open the door.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.496
Dan, if you don't open the door,

11:29.520 --> 11:30.560
we're gonna break it down.

11:30.840 --> 11:33.650
If I let you in, it'll get me.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.003
Dan, it's just me
and my partner.

11:36.520 --> 11:39.126
No, no, no.
I can't open this door.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.242
I don't know how it
gets in, but it does.

11:43.680 --> 11:46.365
Last chance, Dan. Open the door.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.641
You don't understand.
It'll kill me!

11:53.120 --> 11:55.168
Ah!

12:04.960 --> 12:07.122
No, no, no! He'll come for me!

12:07.200 --> 12:10.409
He'll come for all of you!
He won't let you sleep!

12:10.480 --> 12:12.482
Calm down. Calm down.
No one's gonna hurt you.

12:12.640 --> 12:16.770
No, you can't hide from him!
He finds you wherever you are!

12:17.160 --> 12:19.128
Please! Please, no!

12:19.240 --> 12:21.736
He was afraid of something getting in here.
No, no! He'll come for me!

12:21.760 --> 12:24.081
I think whatever
it is is in his head,

12:24.160 --> 12:26.845
and it may be a little
late to nail that shut.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.009
So you're thinking
this is just mental?

12:30.600 --> 12:33.206
No, we're never
just thinking that.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.482
But one can always hope.

12:38.440 --> 12:42.729
We know he's our killer.
What are we looking for?

12:44.560 --> 12:46.085
A reason.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.487
I don't really know much
about anybody that stays here.

13:08.600 --> 13:11.922
I really don't wanna ask.
They really don't wanna tell.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.401
This is not exactly the deLuxe.

13:14.600 --> 13:17.490
Well, how long
has Wells stayed here?

13:17.560 --> 13:21.167
Uh, about two months. You know, I didn't
have a problem with him at first.

13:21.240 --> 13:23.641
Then he kind of got
weirder and weirder.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.563
I think he stopped
taking his meds,

13:25.720 --> 13:27.563
or he started taking
some he shouldn't.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.724
Do you know if he
was using drugs?

13:29.840 --> 13:32.684
Uh, no, I mean, I didn't
see it, but, you know,

13:32.760 --> 13:34.330
he acted like he did sometimes.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.085
Do you have that
previous address?

13:36.160 --> 13:40.051
Yes, actually, I do.
Another hotel, the Jensen.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.083
Also not the deLuxe.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.244
Do you know if anybody's
threatened Wells?

13:44.880 --> 13:49.090
I don't think anybody in the hotel did.
Outside, who knows?

13:49.440 --> 13:50.805
Well, did you know that his door

13:50.880 --> 13:52.769
and his windows were
completely nailed shut?

13:53.240 --> 13:55.846
Crap. I know he was
making a lot of noise.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.524
I didn't know that's
what he was doing.

13:58.080 --> 14:01.607
Eddie! Eddie, Eddie!
Get out here! I need you.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.523
Yeah, what is it?

14:03.600 --> 14:05.967
Uh, we've got a problem in 308.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.520
The idiot nailed shut
his windows and door.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.681
Go take care of it.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.445
Nobody goes in that room until
we're done with the investigation.

14:12.920 --> 14:16.049
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's what I meant.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.326
Thank you.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.731
I'll be around.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.889
Actually, the guy in the wheelchair?
Mmm-hmm.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.486
Did he have any contact with
Wells that you know of?

14:25.160 --> 14:29.006
Mr. Lynk? Spelled
with a Y, by the way.

14:29.760 --> 14:33.731
First name, Charles. Been here
since before anybody can remember.

14:33.880 --> 14:36.611
He don't make contact with
anybody as far as I know.

14:37.480 --> 14:38.845
No one's ever heard him speak.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.689
Thank you.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.490
Meisner?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.644
Meisner, are you here?

15:08.800 --> 15:10.882
Look, don't play games with me.
I'm tired of this!

15:20.600 --> 15:21.965
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

15:22.600 --> 15:26.082
We've spoken on the phone.
Lam Anselmo Baledin.

15:28.440 --> 15:29.680
What are you doing here?

15:30.480 --> 15:34.280
It's important that we talk
now that Bonaparte is dead

15:34.680 --> 15:36.648
and you've killed
your political career.

15:36.720 --> 15:39.929
Look, I told you.
The Grimm was responsible.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.807
You also told us
you can handle the Grimm.

15:43.520 --> 15:46.490
Instead, he seems to have
handled you, quite well.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.206
Well, he had help.

15:48.360 --> 15:49.486
So did you.

15:49.560 --> 15:52.404
Yes, but the help he had was
much better than what I had.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.928
I'm here to clean up
your mistakes.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.044
What exactly does that mean?

15:58.240 --> 15:59.890
Our goals have not changed.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.609
We want you to pick up
where we left off.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.525
You mean with everyone dead?

16:04.880 --> 16:06.291
Except you.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.205
You were the sole survivor.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.444
You said the Grimm
killed Bonaparte.

16:11.640 --> 16:14.325
How do you know this?
Were you there?

16:14.560 --> 16:15.891
I was there.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.402
The Grimm should be dead,
but he's not.

16:19.880 --> 16:21.405
Like I told you,
he's being protected

16:21.480 --> 16:23.084
by something very powerful.

16:23.720 --> 16:26.326
And that's the part I'm having
a hard time understanding.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.402
Well, maybe you can
understand this.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.289
I'm done taking orders.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.843
I'm done with Black Claw.

16:39.680 --> 16:41.205
And I'm done with you.

16:45.840 --> 16:49.242
You were right. It was
important that we talk.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.365
If these seven dots represent
the constellation Pleiades,

17:00.440 --> 17:01.680
could some of the other symbols

17:01.800 --> 17:03.131
represent other constellations?

17:03.440 --> 17:07.330
Okay. This is the Babylonian
symbol for the Pleiades,

17:07.440 --> 17:12.810
which means these two would
be Taurus and Orion.

17:14.319 --> 17:15.765
Then it's possible

17:15.839 --> 17:18.366
this could be some kind
of map of the universe?

17:18.560 --> 17:19.776
I mean, it totally makes sense.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.963
Ancient civilizations charted the
stars for all kinds of reasons.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.049
Religion, cartography, you know,

17:25.119 --> 17:26.201
timing the harvests

17:26.280 --> 17:28.089
based on what constellations
were visible.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.807
So maybe it could be
an ancient calendar.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.568
A calendar of when?

17:37.920 --> 17:41.083
Dan Wells has no
criminal record to speak of.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.889
He's been cited for
public intoxication

17:42.960 --> 17:44.200
and vagrancy a couple times,

17:44.280 --> 17:45.611
but never anything violent.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.170
Yeah, I'm still here.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.480
Uh, how long has Mr. Wells
been on welfare?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.001
Uh-huh.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.845
No, no, no. That's good
for now. Thank you.

17:58.360 --> 17:59.536
According to Housing Authority,

17:59.560 --> 18:02.643
Dan's been living on general
relief and hotel vouchers.

18:03.160 --> 18:06.323
So Wells didn't know the victim.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.084
There's no motive
that we know of.

18:08.160 --> 18:10.128
But he nailed his windows
and his doors shut

18:10.200 --> 18:13.204
because he was scared someone
or something could break in.

18:13.320 --> 18:16.005
And yet, to date, no
record of mental illness?

18:17.440 --> 18:19.807
How does this guy have no
record of mental health issues?

18:20.160 --> 18:23.448
Because whatever happened to
him probably just started.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.409
Yeah, people do have breakdowns.

18:26.720 --> 18:29.166
Especially when they
first encounter Wesen.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.284
Yeah, let's go ask him.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.644
Do you know why
you're here, Dan?

18:36.440 --> 18:38.169
Do you remember being attacked?

18:39.560 --> 18:41.881
Why did you nail the
windows and door shut?

18:44.160 --> 18:45.889
What else could I do?

18:48.880 --> 18:50.644
We're here to help.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.284
What are you afraid of?

18:54.200 --> 18:55.690
Sleeping-

18:57.480 --> 18:58.561
Why?

19:00.080 --> 19:02.321
Because that's when it gets me.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.244
That's why you can't sleep.
You can never sleep, ever!

19:05.400 --> 19:07.050
What gets you, Dan?

19:09.080 --> 19:11.048
I don't know what it is,

19:12.280 --> 19:14.726
but, when it's there,
I can't move.

19:15.720 --> 19:16.926
You're paralyzed?

19:17.040 --> 19:20.249
I said I can't move. At all!

19:23.160 --> 19:24.605
But I see it.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.083
And it's big.

19:29.960 --> 19:34.602
And it comes for me
with its disgusting breath,

19:36.480 --> 19:38.562
its huge mouth full of...

19:41.360 --> 19:43.089
Not teeth exactly...

19:44.040 --> 19:45.405
Then, what?

19:54.240 --> 19:57.005
Take it easy. Not gonna hurt you
in here again, okay? All right...

19:58.160 --> 20:00.128
We're gonna need a chemical
restraint in here!

20:03.400 --> 20:04.686
Or that.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.769
I am pretty sure

20:11.720 --> 20:13.927
this is a piece of
the Sumerian calendar.

20:14.280 --> 20:17.523
I think this one is associated
with the Mayan calendar.

20:17.920 --> 20:20.651
So how did the Sumerians get
mixed up with the Mayans?

20:21.000 --> 20:22.286
That's two different continents,

20:22.360 --> 20:25.489
two very different cultures,
two different times.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.136
Yeah, I mean, the Mayans
and the Sumerians

20:27.160 --> 20:29.208
are, like, 3,000 years apart,

20:29.280 --> 20:30.770
give or take a century or two.

20:30.840 --> 20:33.650
Unless they're connected
in a way we don't understand.

20:33.720 --> 20:35.370
What, you mean like
wormhole connected?

20:35.480 --> 20:36.811
Yeah, why not?

20:37.840 --> 20:39.046
Hey! Hi.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.485
Having any luck?

20:41.200 --> 20:43.521
We think this might
be an ancient calendar.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.927
So this is a calendar?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.923
Here's the deal.
We're thinking that,

20:49.040 --> 20:50.929
if this is a map
of the stars, right,

20:51.000 --> 20:52.843
and some of these symbols
are constellations,

20:53.040 --> 20:55.691
maybe a reason to map them out
this way is to tell time.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.766
What if this was some event
a very long time ago,

21:01.440 --> 21:03.920
and that might tell us
where the stick came from?

21:04.200 --> 21:05.690
That would be good to know.

21:06.080 --> 21:09.129
That would, but it's
not why we're here.

21:09.480 --> 21:10.606
You're looking for a Wesen?

21:10.680 --> 21:12.330
Have you ever heard of a Wesen

21:12.400 --> 21:14.562
with a big mouth, strange teeth?

21:14.760 --> 21:16.410
And it paralyzes you in bed.

21:17.320 --> 21:18.456
Hmm. Does it have bad breath?

21:18.480 --> 21:19.481
That's what he said.

21:19.560 --> 21:20.971
That sounds like an Alpe.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.486
An Alp? Like,
a Swiss mountain Alp?

21:23.560 --> 21:25.847
No, different kind of Alp.
"Alpe" with an E.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.126
I got this in one of my books.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.690
According to Germanic folklore,

21:28.760 --> 21:33.129
Alpen are responsible for
sleep paralysis and insomnia.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.328
Here it is. Check this out.

21:35.400 --> 21:38.768
When I was a teenager, a lot of
my family still lived in Germany,

21:39.280 --> 21:41.647
and I was spending the summer
with my great-aunt Ada.

21:41.720 --> 21:43.165
She was always a little loopy,

21:43.280 --> 21:44.656
which is why she was
my favorite aunt,

21:44.680 --> 21:47.889
but her mental state had
begun to seriously decline.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.690
And we didn't know
this until later,

21:49.760 --> 21:53.685
but the reason Ada was going
mad was because of an Alpe.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.604
These are definitely not teeth.

21:58.680 --> 22:03.368
Yeah, I don't know if there's a
word for them, but I know what they do.

22:04.360 --> 22:06.966
They get inside
your head and feed.

22:07.080 --> 22:08.081
On what?

22:08.240 --> 22:09.890
Well, they feed on your sleep.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.327
Basically, they steal it.
I mean, with good reason

22:12.400 --> 22:15.529
because Alpen go insane
if they don't feed nightly

22:15.600 --> 22:18.570
on the proteins our brains
create during REM sleep.

22:18.640 --> 22:20.608
But if the feeding
goes on for, like,

22:20.680 --> 22:21.886
a few too many nights,

22:21.960 --> 22:24.406
then it eventually makes
their victims go crazy,

22:24.480 --> 22:25.845
like my aunt Ada.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.684
How do these Alpen
find their next victims?

22:27.760 --> 22:29.808
Melatonin, lots of it.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.968
And the heavier the sleeper,
the more melatonin.

22:32.040 --> 22:35.089
And Alpen can sense that. It's
like a drug addict with a drug.

22:35.160 --> 22:37.527
But why would an Alpe keep
attacking the same victim?

22:37.600 --> 22:39.682
Because when the body
is overcompensating,

22:39.760 --> 22:42.331
the brain produces even more
melatonin when it's not sleeping.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.565
Where was this victim attacked?

22:44.880 --> 22:46.041
The Englewood Hotel.

22:46.120 --> 22:48.248
And how it got in
that room, we know not.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.163
Well, a hotel makes sense.

22:50.320 --> 22:52.129
Lots of sleeping victims
to choose from.

22:52.280 --> 22:53.725
So it could be
anyone in that hotel.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.643
Or who has access to the rooms.

22:56.280 --> 22:58.931
Over 35 people staying
at the Englewood Hotel

22:59.000 --> 23:00.923
the night before
Dan attacked our victim,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.446
not including the manager
or the maintenance man.

23:03.520 --> 23:05.045
Any one of them
could be an Alpe,

23:05.120 --> 23:06.804
but how can we
justify dragging them in

23:06.880 --> 23:09.451
for questioning if
it's about eating sleep?

23:09.640 --> 23:12.883
But Wells nailed
his windows and door shut.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.246
How did this Alpe get in?

23:14.320 --> 23:16.971
Well, maybe the Alpe was in
there, and Dan didn't know it.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.406
Not that big a room.

23:19.440 --> 23:24.241
Listen to this. In 1954, a
long-term guest killed a maid.

23:24.680 --> 23:26.569
That one was
linked to psychosis,

23:26.640 --> 23:28.496
but there have been
several problems since then,

23:28.520 --> 23:31.285
including six suicides
and three murders.

23:31.360 --> 23:32.771
So what are we thinking?

23:32.840 --> 23:34.808
This Alpe has been using
the Englewood Hotel

23:34.920 --> 23:36.843
as a buffet
for the last 60 years?

23:36.920 --> 23:39.480
Hey, what was the name of the old
guy, the one in the wheelchair?

23:39.520 --> 23:43.605
Lynk, with a Y. Charles.

23:43.840 --> 23:47.128
The manager said he had been in the hotel
a long time.

23:47.640 --> 23:50.610
Here it is. Middle name,
Herring. No record.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.205
Doesn't mean he's not a Wesen.

23:52.360 --> 23:54.806
Got your info on the once
lovely Englewood Hotel

23:54.880 --> 23:56.006
owned by Beverly Garwood.

23:56.080 --> 23:58.651
According to this, she lives in LA.
You have a number?

23:58.800 --> 24:00.370
No, it's my first day
on the job.

24:02.680 --> 24:04.648
She is in the 323.

24:10.680 --> 24:11.806
Hello?

24:11.880 --> 24:13.848
Beverly Garwood? Yes?

24:14.000 --> 24:16.287
This is Detective Burkhardt
from the Portland police.

24:16.360 --> 24:19.330
We're checking on a property you
own here, the Englewood Hotel.

24:19.720 --> 24:20.801
What's this about?

24:20.880 --> 24:23.042
One of your guests was involved
in a murder yesterday.

24:23.320 --> 24:25.288
Oh, my God! On the property?

24:25.400 --> 24:26.481
No.

24:26.560 --> 24:27.971
Well, how can I help you?

24:28.200 --> 24:30.016
We're looking for a
little background information

24:30.040 --> 24:31.769
on a couple of the employees,

24:32.160 --> 24:35.243
Scott Mudgett and Eddie Holmes.
You know them?

24:35.440 --> 24:38.250
I don't manage the
property on a day-to-day basis.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.766
I inherited it
from my grandfather.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.410
I can't tell you
much about them,

24:42.520 --> 24:44.249
except that they
keep the place running.

24:44.440 --> 24:46.249
It's not what it once was.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.360
Well, have you ever
had any problems there?

24:48.440 --> 24:49.566
What do you mean?

24:49.680 --> 24:52.729
There seem to have been a few
violent incidents over the years.

24:52.840 --> 24:54.001
That happens in every hotel.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.600
Is there something
out of the ordinary?

24:55.680 --> 24:56.886
No.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.525
Thank you for your time.

24:58.680 --> 25:00.842
Feel free to call me if
there's anything I can do.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.325
She was a big help.

25:04.440 --> 25:07.091
We still don't know how the
Alpe got in Dan's room

25:07.160 --> 25:08.605
'cause his place was a fortress.

25:08.720 --> 25:11.485
These things can't
walk through walls.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.245
Can they?

25:56.640 --> 25:57.680
I'm not here to haunt you.

25:57.800 --> 26:00.610
Really? Then why don't you go
wherever it is you go?

26:01.000 --> 26:02.536
Well, you might wanna
reconsider conversing

26:02.560 --> 26:04.130
with someone
no one else can see.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.646
I believe they're
going to kill you.

26:17.160 --> 26:18.161
Who?

26:18.440 --> 26:20.010
Two men waiting by your car.

26:22.720 --> 26:25.883
Why are you telling me this?
You trust me?

27:04.200 --> 27:07.249
You saved my life. Why?

27:08.760 --> 27:11.889
This time, you chose
the right side, Sean.

27:22.240 --> 27:23.605
Are we done?

27:44.280 --> 27:45.770
Oh, my God!

27:48.600 --> 27:49.601
Ah!

27:51.640 --> 27:53.051
Oh, my God.

28:04.080 --> 28:06.128
It's Laura Driscoll, room 305,

28:06.200 --> 28:08.089
across the hall from Dan Wells.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.767
I don't know what happened. I really
don't know why you guys are here.

28:11.840 --> 28:15.287
I mean, you know, she tripped. She fell.
These things happen.

28:15.440 --> 28:16.771
What, nobody saw it?

28:16.920 --> 28:19.651
Uh, no, I mean, we
just heard her scream,

28:19.760 --> 28:20.807
and then she fell.

28:20.960 --> 28:21.961
And who found the body?

28:22.040 --> 28:23.041
Uh, our maintenance man,

28:23.120 --> 28:24.360
Eddie.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.804
I got him in the office.
I'll get him.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.524
She's not dressed to go out.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.456
She ever wander the halls
in her pajamas before?

28:32.480 --> 28:34.801
Hey, guys, I don't
stay up all night.

28:34.920 --> 28:37.241
The guests are
gonna do what they do.

28:37.480 --> 28:38.840
How long has
she been staying here?

28:38.920 --> 28:40.206
About three months.

28:40.320 --> 28:42.322
You found the body? Yeah.

28:42.400 --> 28:45.609
I was covering the front desk
when I heard the scream.

28:45.800 --> 28:49.327
I didn't think much of it at first,
you know? We get that down here.

28:50.440 --> 28:52.602
- But then...
- Anyone else around?

28:52.680 --> 28:56.207
No. It was pretty early,
about 6:00 this morning.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.889
Let's go check out her room.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.526
Other than the bedding on the
floor, no signs of a struggle.

29:18.520 --> 29:22.844
Well, the windows are locked. At least
there are no chains or nails this time.

29:22.960 --> 29:25.327
I checked the door.
No sign of forced entry.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.209
Then why did she
run out of her room?

29:27.360 --> 29:30.762
Dan Wells was gone. Maybe she
was the Alpe's next meal.

29:30.840 --> 29:34.367
Well, if she was, how is
this Alpe getting in?

29:34.720 --> 29:37.246
I don't know, but I've got
the manager on my list.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.402
Looks like this window
was nailed shut before.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.729
All we got now is an accident.

29:46.200 --> 29:48.567
We need to catch
this Alpe in the act.

29:49.040 --> 29:52.203
So we think the Alpe is
using the Englewood Hotel

29:52.280 --> 29:54.282
as its own personal cafeteria.

29:54.680 --> 29:56.489
We need someone to spend
one night in there,

29:56.600 --> 29:59.570
so that we can catch it
the next time it strikes.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.768
Right. And it can't
be either of you guys

30:01.840 --> 30:03.280
since you've both
been there as cops,

30:04.560 --> 30:05.925
which is why
you're looking at me.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.331
I don't want him getting hurt.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.084
I'm in complete agreement
with her on that.

30:09.200 --> 30:10.736
Well, there will be
a camera inside the room,

30:10.760 --> 30:11.856
and he will be wearing a wire.

30:11.880 --> 30:12.961
And we'll be right outside.

30:13.080 --> 30:16.482
Look, just think of it
as payback for Aunt Ada.

30:18.360 --> 30:19.361
I guess.

30:19.440 --> 30:20.856
The only problem is,
Alpen are attracted

30:20.880 --> 30:22.609
to heavy sleepers,
which I am not.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.563
Well, melatonin is
the chemical in the brain

30:24.640 --> 30:25.736
that makes you sleep, right?

30:25.760 --> 30:27.171
That's why your
brain produces it.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.323
You can take melatonin.

30:29.400 --> 30:30.840
Couldn't you give him
a little boost?

30:30.880 --> 30:32.120
I can give him a big boost,

30:32.200 --> 30:34.726
but I'm still concerned about
that whole paralysis thing.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.936
It's never gonna get that far.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.040
Nick and Hank will be there

30:37.080 --> 30:39.560
the second the Alpe walks
in the room. Right?

30:40.040 --> 30:41.040
Yup! Yes.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.200
We will be monitoring Monroe

30:42.240 --> 30:44.641
from the second he steps
foot in that hotel.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.689
I'm not sleeping a wink
until you get home.

30:47.760 --> 30:49.125
That's very sweet.

30:49.240 --> 30:51.368
Now, how do we get
enough melatonin in me?

31:00.560 --> 31:01.561
Okay-

31:11.640 --> 31:14.041
Okay, be sure to
set up the camera

31:14.120 --> 31:15.645
so you have a view
of the whole room.

31:15.720 --> 31:16.721
Got it.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.256
Now, the only way you're
gonna be able to hear us

31:18.280 --> 31:19.406
is with this earbud,

31:19.520 --> 31:21.256
but don't put it in
until you're in the room.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.282
And here's your
Housing Authority voucher.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.810
We see or hear anything,
we're coming in. Good.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.121
Sure you're ready?

31:28.640 --> 31:30.216
If I don't get into that
hotel room pretty soon,

31:30.240 --> 31:31.685
I'm gonna fall asleep
in the lobby.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.007
All right.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.210
Need a room?

31:49.280 --> 31:50.805
Yeah.

31:55.840 --> 31:58.207
Just for one night?
It's all I need.

31:58.320 --> 32:00.721
Just passing through.

32:01.680 --> 32:05.890
Name, previous address if you have one.
Check out's 11:00.

32:11.680 --> 32:13.170
305.

32:14.400 --> 32:17.324
We have an elevator,
but it's not working.

32:18.480 --> 32:20.005
Thank you.

32:39.880 --> 32:40.881
Wow.

32:50.720 --> 32:53.007
Well, I'm in. Room 305.

32:53.080 --> 32:54.127
All right.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.766
Lock the door and windows.
Set the camera. Go to bed.

32:56.840 --> 32:58.330
Doing it now.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.325
Door locked.

33:05.240 --> 33:06.730
Window locked.

33:08.400 --> 33:09.925
Window locked.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.730
All right,

33:19.240 --> 33:23.131
so this is the room.

33:27.320 --> 33:30.005
It is... It... I mean, palatial.

33:32.560 --> 33:34.005
I'm gonna put
the camera right here

33:34.120 --> 33:35.610
on the dresser
across from the bed,

33:35.680 --> 33:37.205
so you can't miss me.

33:42.160 --> 33:44.481
Can you see me? Loud and clear.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.568
I'm going to bed.

33:51.240 --> 33:52.241
Whoa.

33:53.040 --> 33:54.565
No, I'm not,

33:56.120 --> 33:57.281
not in there.

34:05.120 --> 34:09.967
Boy, I hope this works fast because
this is a really uncomfortable bed-

34:11.920 --> 34:12.920
Can you still see me?

34:13.080 --> 34:14.286
Yeah, we got you.

34:14.480 --> 34:15.811
All right.

34:17.400 --> 34:18.400
Ugh.

34:32.280 --> 34:34.168
Anything? Nothing yet.

34:48.840 --> 34:50.524
This reminds me
of some foreign films

34:50.639 --> 34:52.244
my second wife
used to drag me to,

34:52.360 --> 34:54.248
except this one
has a better plot.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.923
What's going on?
Someone's in there.

35:38.840 --> 35:40.046
Back up!

35:55.400 --> 35:56.401
Monroe!

35:56.480 --> 35:57.641
Where did it go?

35:57.720 --> 36:00.326
Monroe, can you move?

36:01.400 --> 36:04.483
Camera got knocked over. It had to
have come from behind the dresser.

36:04.640 --> 36:05.880
All right, check behind it.

36:05.960 --> 36:07.325
It's hollow.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.360
It looks like it's
attached to the wall.

36:12.360 --> 36:13.486
Some kind of passageway.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.082
If he went out this way,
we've got to go in.

36:16.440 --> 36:17.566
We'll be back.

36:19.640 --> 36:21.290
It's getting away.
We've got to go.

36:24.320 --> 36:27.290
You can't leave me like this!

36:59.680 --> 37:01.523
Yeah. Hundjäger.

37:01.600 --> 37:02.601
Huh?

37:17.640 --> 37:20.016
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I
thought we were after an Alpe.

37:20.040 --> 37:21.405
Nick! Hank!

37:21.480 --> 37:22.686
In here.

37:24.160 --> 37:26.925
So I guess you were trying to
tell us that he was a Hundjäger.

37:27.040 --> 37:30.487
What? Scott, the manager.

37:30.960 --> 37:32.962
I didn't see any Hundjäger.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.088
Dude, I saw an Alpe!

37:35.440 --> 37:36.680
God...

37:37.200 --> 37:38.486
Where is he?

37:38.560 --> 37:40.449
There's got to be
another passageway.

37:59.520 --> 38:00.726
I hear him.

38:10.640 --> 38:13.120
Well, we've come this far.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.768
This is a welfare hotel?

38:32.080 --> 38:33.127
Oh, my God. Who are you?

38:33.200 --> 38:35.123
What are you doing here?
I'm calling the police.

38:39.200 --> 38:40.725
I left mine at home.

38:41.240 --> 38:44.164
Beverly Garwood. So you don't
live in Los Angeles, after all.

38:44.680 --> 38:45.806
What do you want?

38:46.000 --> 38:48.048
A little payback
for my great-aunt Ada.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.121
Huh?

38:50.560 --> 38:53.404
Oh, yeah, you're the Alpe.

39:04.360 --> 39:06.761
Oh, my God. You're a Grimm.

39:07.280 --> 39:10.170
So you can see we kind
of have a problem.

39:10.400 --> 39:12.482
Don't talk to me about problems.

39:12.560 --> 39:15.370
You don't know what it's like
to live without any sleep.

39:16.240 --> 39:20.962
Besides, what would you charge
me with, being an Alpe?

39:21.360 --> 39:23.203
I didn't kill anyone.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.964
I suggest you leave.

39:25.960 --> 39:29.806
The way I see it, Beverly,
you have two choices.

39:31.800 --> 39:35.361
One, you sell the hotel,

39:35.440 --> 39:38.011
give all the proceeds
to local homeless shelters,

39:38.280 --> 39:40.123
and you leave Portland forever.

39:40.280 --> 39:43.124
I don't think so.
What's the other?

39:43.600 --> 39:45.125
As you said,

39:45.800 --> 39:47.689
lam a Grimm.

39:48.880 --> 39:50.803
One less Alpe in the world,

39:53.960 --> 39:56.611
who's gonna lose
any sleep over that?

40:05.320 --> 40:06.731
I'll call my real estate agent

40:06.840 --> 40:08.171
first thing in the morning.

40:20.240 --> 40:21.241
Mmm.

40:30.880 --> 40:33.770
Well, like the man said,

40:34.640 --> 40:37.530
"Life is a nightmare that
prevents one from sleeping."

40:37.960 --> 40:39.200
So,

40:40.080 --> 40:41.206
sleep well.

40:57.880 --> 41:00.042
You know how the Mayan
calendar ended in 2012?

41:00.120 --> 41:01.121
Mmm-hmm.

41:01.200 --> 41:03.407
Well, the problem
is you can't predict

41:03.520 --> 41:04.726
specific years from the stars

41:04.840 --> 41:06.285
because they
don't actually move,

41:06.400 --> 41:07.925
but if we could map the position

41:08.040 --> 41:09.565
of the planets
in our solar system,

41:09.640 --> 41:11.324
wouldn't we be able
to figure it out?

41:12.440 --> 41:14.488
You mean because
our planets will never

41:14.600 --> 41:16.648
be in the exact same
alignment ever again.

41:17.320 --> 41:19.288
You know,
I actually have a program

41:19.360 --> 41:23.410
that could roughly calculate the
date based on planet position.

41:25.720 --> 41:29.247
Okay, cool, that's our
solar system. There's Earth.

41:29.320 --> 41:32.847
Now, if we can just try to
match the drawing on the cloth

41:32.920 --> 41:34.763
with our planet's position...

41:35.480 --> 41:39.280
I'll match with today's date
and work backwards from there.

41:43.080 --> 41:44.491
Is it working?

41:45.960 --> 41:47.166
Not really.

41:47.240 --> 41:49.607
The farther back I go, the
more out of alignment it gets.

41:50.200 --> 41:51.850
Maybe it isn't
a calendar after all.

41:51.920 --> 41:53.763
Hold up. Let me try it again.

41:54.520 --> 41:55.885
That looks right.

41:58.720 --> 42:00.290
No, I went way too far forward.

42:00.360 --> 42:01.646
No, what do you mean?
It matches.

42:01.720 --> 42:05.202
Yeah, but that's not in the past.
That's in the future.

42:05.560 --> 42:07.324
March 24th.

42:11.120 --> 42:13.009
So it is a calendar.

42:13.360 --> 42:14.850
I think it is.

42:16.160 --> 42:18.925
For something that
hasn't happened yet?
