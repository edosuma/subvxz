Narrator:
In New York City war on crime,

00:08.342 --> 00:12.017
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:12.045 --> 00:13.649
of the Major Case Squad.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.818
These are their stories.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.000
All she has to do is keep
her head elevated.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.509
Explain that to her.
You can do that, can't you?

00:31.532 --> 00:33.239
Going up again tomorrow, Doc?

00:33.267 --> 00:35.713
No. Next Saturday. Gives
you a whole week to clean it.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.682
Did my wife call?

00:37.704 --> 00:40.685
If she does, tell her I'll be
in the office in half an hour.

00:40.707 --> 00:44.678
I think people who have children to save
their marriage are just kidding themselves.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.850
Then why do you want to have children?

00:46.880 --> 00:51.158
I just think we lead a
selfish life, Peter and me.

00:51.184 --> 00:54.028
You know, with our dinners, and our hobbies.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.364
You think you'd make a good mother?

00:56.390 --> 00:57.869
I don't know.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.269
My friends who have kids, they didn't know.

01:00.294 --> 01:02.900
So you make this decision to have a child.

01:02.930 --> 01:06.844
What would you have to change
to make yourself ready?

01:09.670 --> 01:12.947
I would need to cut out
my little mood adjusters--

01:12.973 --> 01:14.850
once and for all this time.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.854
You think you could do that, Valerie?

01:25.018 --> 01:27.464
Peter. Hi, honey, how was your flight?

01:27.487 --> 01:30.661
I got six people here, plus
a patient out cold on the table.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.501
Okay, well, I just wanted to hear your voice.

01:33.527 --> 01:36.007
Oh, I found a couch at Palizetti.

01:36.029 --> 01:39.033
You want me to pay for the
couch, let me do my job.

01:43.036 --> 01:46.176
We decided on Martinique sometime in February.

01:46.206 --> 01:49.517
Two weeks in the sun. A romantic holiday.

01:49.543 --> 01:52.490
- Oh, right.
- Jen, don't start.

01:52.512 --> 01:55.186
I have to be downtown in 20 minutes.

01:55.215 --> 01:57.388
After all he's put you through?

01:58.719 --> 02:01.700
Just be my friend, okay?
I've got enough judges.

02:01.722 --> 02:04.362
Val, you need to leave Peter.

02:04.391 --> 02:08.634
That's not going to happen.
I wouldn't do that to my parents.

02:11.331 --> 02:14.005
You want to grasp the loose
skin on the upper arm

02:14.034 --> 02:17.481
and make an incision extending
from the elbow to the axilla.

02:17.504 --> 02:19.882
This is where you got to be precise.

02:19.906 --> 02:23.683
Steer clear of the ligaments,
underlying musculature, or...

02:26.346 --> 02:29.520
Her arm could come off like the wing
of a Thanksgiving turkey.

02:34.021 --> 02:36.831
You look good. How long can you stay?

02:36.857 --> 02:40.361
I've only got an hour. We need to talk.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.401
- Here you are, Dr. Kelmer.
- What's that?

02:46.433 --> 02:48.003
Somebody left it for your wife.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.345
- Give it to me.
- They said she has to sign for it.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.543
Give it to me. I'll get her signature.

03:14.161 --> 03:16.641
Valerie: Peter?

03:16.663 --> 03:18.506
In here.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.646
I bought something for the Promise Ball.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.674
It's a Judith Leiber.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.316
If you hate it, I'll take it back.

03:32.345 --> 03:34.347
It's nice.

03:35.682 --> 03:38.526
I'm a mess. I'll see you after my bath?

03:47.360 --> 03:49.840
- Forget something, Doc?
- No, I'm going up.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.036
I didn't get a chance to clean her.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.043
Pull the chocks.

03:56.703 --> 03:58.705
What about your flight plan?

04:05.645 --> 04:07.818
Your flight plan!

04:09.616 --> 04:11.755
( theme music playing )

04:56.530 --> 04:58.840
She left just after 1:00 Sunday afternoon.

04:58.865 --> 05:00.606
I went to the hospital around 2:00.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.205
I was in surgeries all evening.
I'm a cosmetic surgeon.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.772
I called her, no answer.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.115
When I got home early Monday morning,

05:07.140 --> 05:08.551
she still wasn't back.

05:08.575 --> 05:11.112
When she left, did she
say where she was going?

05:11.144 --> 05:14.455
No, we'd had a fight. We just needed
to go to our separate corners.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.291
- Do you fight a lot?
- No. Can I go on?

05:17.317 --> 05:19.558
Deakins: Have you talked to her friends?

05:19.586 --> 05:22.465
Yes. Friends, family, everyone I can think of.

05:22.489 --> 05:26.266
I made a list. All of
Valerie's friends, relatives,

05:26.293 --> 05:28.773
with their addresses and phone numbers.

05:30.230 --> 05:33.473
On Tuesday I filed a
report with Missing Persons.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.947
It's been three days. Nobody called,

05:36.970 --> 05:41.510
so a friend in the mayor's office
suggested I come here.

05:41.541 --> 05:43.578
What do you think happened to her?

05:44.845 --> 05:47.985
Before we met, Valerie had
had psychiatric problems.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.324
She'd attempted suicide 7 or 8 years ago.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.830
And you think she hurt herself?

05:52.853 --> 05:55.163
She threaten something like that?

05:55.188 --> 05:56.496
Not to me.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.163
On the list there's a
Dr. Nathanson, her therapist.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.401
I called him and gave him
permission to talk to you.

06:02.429 --> 06:03.999
That's very helpful, Doctor.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.101
I got a copy of the report
from Missing Persons.

06:06.132 --> 06:09.306
They checked with hospitals
and paramedics in all 5 boroughs.

06:09.336 --> 06:14.342
There's another thing-- occasionally,
Valerie did drugs with her girlfriends.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.116
Cocaine, amphetamines too.

06:17.143 --> 06:20.022
- We've had endless discussions about it.
- You don't use drugs?

06:21.314 --> 06:22.884
Of course not.

06:22.916 --> 06:26.557
Anyway, if something happened
to her while she was on drugs--

06:26.586 --> 06:29.362
well, you wanted to know what I thought.

06:32.592 --> 06:35.573
I put all my numbers on that sheet.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.632
As soon as we find
something, we'll call you.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.302
No, I want to get your numbers.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.334
I'll be calling you.

06:45.438 --> 06:47.543
I just don't want to be the last to know.

06:53.713 --> 06:56.922
How do we like being an annex
to the Missing Persons Bureau?

06:57.918 --> 07:01.798
This friends and neighbors list,
it's alphabetized.

07:01.821 --> 07:03.926
I should have him work on my sock drawer.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.937
Guy obviously being a barrel of laughs,

07:05.959 --> 07:08.269
I'm taking bets she doesn't
want him to find her.

07:08.295 --> 07:11.333
Her cousin Jennifer Barish filed
her own Missing Persons report

07:11.364 --> 07:13.469
a day before Kelmer did.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.208
She told them she suspects foul play.

07:19.973 --> 07:23.113
I knew the minute he
called me looking for her--

07:23.143 --> 07:25.623
I knew Peter had killed her.

07:25.645 --> 07:29.149
- A gut feeling?
- He has terrible temper.

07:30.317 --> 07:32.957
Valerie was scared to death of him.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.125
And she knew he had a mistress.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.759
Did she know who?

07:36.790 --> 07:38.633
No, she just knew there was someone.

07:38.658 --> 07:40.501
When's the last time you talked to her?

07:40.527 --> 07:44.270
Saturday. She came over for lunch.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.334
Did she seem depressed?

07:46.366 --> 07:48.346
Depressed?

07:48.368 --> 07:50.314
What did Peter tell you?

07:50.337 --> 07:52.010
That she was suicidal?

07:52.038 --> 07:53.608
She wasn't depressed at all.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.621
Dr. Kelmer told us
Valerie's been doing drugs.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.522
- Cocaine, uppers.
- Not that much.

07:59.546 --> 08:02.390
Who does she do them with?
Girlfriends? Boyfriends?

08:02.415 --> 08:03.689
This is unfair.

08:03.717 --> 08:06.926
Valerie told me her shrink warned her.

08:06.953 --> 08:10.958
He told her someday Peter
was really going to hurt her.

08:14.794 --> 08:17.274
I had to laugh when I got
the message from Peter

08:17.297 --> 08:19.777
giving me permission to talk to you.

08:19.799 --> 08:21.779
As long as she might be alive,

08:21.801 --> 08:25.374
Valerie is the only one who
can waive the confidentiality.

08:25.405 --> 08:27.976
As a doctor, Peter bloody well knows that.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.715
Let's put it this way--

08:29.743 --> 08:31.745
are you concerned about her safety?

08:31.778 --> 08:33.655
I'm concerned about any patient

08:33.679 --> 08:36.126
who misses 2 sessions without calling me.

08:36.149 --> 08:39.528
I still can't discuss her situation with you.

08:39.552 --> 08:42.032
I took a few psych classes in college.

08:42.054 --> 08:44.193
How about I give you my opinion?

08:44.224 --> 08:46.670
If you agree, you let me know.

08:47.827 --> 08:50.205
How? By coughing twice?

08:50.230 --> 08:52.107
Coughing's good.

08:53.666 --> 08:55.475
Here goes.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.812
Kelmer's a control freak.

08:57.837 --> 08:59.817
She's self-destructive.

08:59.839 --> 09:02.046
The more he tries to control her,

09:02.075 --> 09:03.418
the more she rebels.

09:03.443 --> 09:06.185
She takes a love; Kelmer panics,

09:06.212 --> 09:08.624
he gets angry, he kills hen

09:12.285 --> 09:13.923
Same scenario,

09:13.953 --> 09:16.092
except his efforts to control her

09:16.122 --> 09:18.762
lead her to feelings of depression,

09:18.792 --> 09:21.864
hopelessness. She suicides.

09:27.634 --> 09:29.910
She ran away and joined the circus?

09:29.936 --> 09:32.576
Oh, was I supposed to cough?

09:33.940 --> 09:36.284
Any scenario's possible, Detective.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.789
For now, I have to assume she's still alive.

09:38.812 --> 09:42.487
All right, you have our number.
If you hear from her, please call.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.392
Thank you.

09:46.986 --> 09:50.092
Among her friends and family,
even odds it's Kelmer.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.729
Found more candidates
in her cell phone records.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.672
These four gentlemen callers
weren't on Kelmer's list.

09:55.695 --> 09:58.676
This one, Warren D'Alacosta,
Friday and Saturday alone

09:58.698 --> 10:01.645
he and Valerie called each other
half a dozen times.

10:01.668 --> 10:04.148
I don't know any Valerie whatever.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.150
Must have been a wrong number.

10:06.172 --> 10:08.846
You want to rethink that
answer, Mr. D'Alacosta?

10:08.875 --> 10:11.651
We looked into your pedigree--
couple DUls, couple dope pops,

10:11.678 --> 10:14.454
delinquent on your child support.
You drive too fast,

10:14.481 --> 10:18.554
drink too much, don't meet your obligations,
don't give a damn about anybody.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.895
My partner has a fancy word
for people like you--

10:20.920 --> 10:23.901
Psychopath. I call them screw ups.

10:23.923 --> 10:27.530
If you want to join the 2 million of
your fellow psychopaths already in jail,

10:27.560 --> 10:30.598
just keep lying to the police.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.371
Okay, so I know her.

10:33.700 --> 10:37.307
Is there any reason why
you're not inviting us in?

10:40.707 --> 10:43.347
So, Warren, weren't you concerned

10:43.376 --> 10:46.050
when you didn't hear from Valerie for a week?

10:47.380 --> 10:51.795
- No. She said she wanted to stop seeing me.
- Why?

10:51.818 --> 10:55.561
She said she needed to get serious
about her life, her marriage.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.829
Must've been a big disappointment for you.

10:57.857 --> 11:00.269
I knew it wasn't going to last.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.738
Are one of these her?

11:03.296 --> 11:05.105
Can we see it, please?

11:15.842 --> 11:17.685
It's very nice.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.022
You couldn't pay me enough.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.992
I'll be there in a few hours.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.362
What size shirt do you wear?

11:27.387 --> 11:29.663
- (door opens)
- I have to go.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.669
All done, Doctor.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.918
Dr. Kelmer came in around 4:00 on Saturday.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.821
I gave him his mail and
the hand-delivered envelope

11:51.844 --> 11:53.152
addressed to Mrs. Kelmer.

11:53.179 --> 11:56.183
- When did she get home?
- Um... a few minutes after.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.196
Did you see her on Sunday?

11:58.218 --> 12:00.164
- Uh, no.
- How about him?

12:00.186 --> 12:02.291
No, no, no.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.962
Are there any other exits in here?

12:04.991 --> 12:08.666
No, but the basement connects
to the garage next door.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.335
He used to park next to me.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.642
Then he complained about these phantom dings,

12:15.668 --> 12:17.045
so he had the condo board

12:17.070 --> 12:20.142
move me over here next
to this beautiful column.

12:20.173 --> 12:23.620
- Were you down here Sunday?
- Yes. Around 2:00.

12:23.643 --> 12:26.487
My wife and I drove back
from the farm in Pennsylvania.

12:26.512 --> 12:29.152
Did you see Mrs. Kelmer or the doctor?

12:29.182 --> 12:30.661
Just him.

12:30.683 --> 12:32.663
We were unloading the car,

12:32.685 --> 12:35.325
and I heard a noise, turned
around, and there he was.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.493
Where?

12:36.522 --> 12:38.263
Over there, behind his car.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.168
He'd just closed the trunk.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.332
- Did you see what was in it?
- No.

12:42.362 --> 12:45.343
I heard this thunk, and then he
got in his car and drove away.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.506
It could've been his wife's body.
It could've been a beach ball.

12:51.537 --> 12:54.677
It could've been nothing.
There's no evidence she's even dead.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.084
I have a strong feeling she is.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.453
I stand corrected. Then she suicided.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.651
This was a woman, according
to her phone records,

13:00.680 --> 13:03.217
who spent hours on the phone
talking to her friends.

13:03.249 --> 13:06.025
But from Saturday afternoon on,
there's not a peep from her.

13:06.052 --> 13:07.861
Maybe she had laryngitis.

13:07.887 --> 13:11.164
I want to go at him with a search
warrant for his car, for his apartment.

13:11.190 --> 13:14.933
- Goren.
- What? Are we worried about the noses
he did at City Hall

13:14.961 --> 13:16.463
getting bent out of shape?

13:16.496 --> 13:19.375
(phone ringing)

13:19.399 --> 13:21.640
Major Case, Eames speaking.

13:21.668 --> 13:25.013
We'll be right there. The 2-0 caught a break.

13:29.676 --> 13:33.055
Man: I told the Officers her
hairstyle was different.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.820
More swept off her face, you know?

13:34.847 --> 13:36.986
But the minute I seen this poster outside,

13:37.016 --> 13:40.327
- I knew that's the one was in
here 2 days ago.
- Was she with anybody?

13:40.353 --> 13:42.333
- Nah.
- Did she seem okay?

13:42.355 --> 13:44.835
She ordered two pounds of Nova.

13:44.857 --> 13:46.666
You have an excellent memory.

13:46.693 --> 13:48.673
You wear those glasses while you work?

13:48.695 --> 13:49.935
Only when I'm slicing.

13:49.962 --> 13:52.033
When I'm talking to a customer, I drop them.

13:52.065 --> 13:55.012
Anyone else see her? What about him?

13:55.034 --> 13:56.672
He wouldn't know his own mother.

13:56.703 --> 13:59.343
Listen, black leather coat,

13:59.372 --> 14:01.283
gray shirt with black trim

14:01.307 --> 14:03.787
was what she wore when last seen, right?

14:03.810 --> 14:05.448
That's what she had on.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.719
Trust me, it was her.

14:13.152 --> 14:15.792
Man: I don't understand
your warrant application.

14:15.822 --> 14:17.961
Wasn't his wife seen in a deli a few days ago?

14:17.990 --> 14:19.970
The sighting's unreliable, Your Honor.

14:19.992 --> 14:22.802
- The witness is nearsighted.
- What's your bedrock evidence?

14:22.829 --> 14:25.309
Somebody who thought they heard
a car trunk slam shut?

14:25.331 --> 14:27.436
If we search his car and his apartment,

14:27.467 --> 14:29.913
and it turns out his wife is
alive, where's the harm?

14:29.936 --> 14:33.975
It's the Fourth Amendment,
Detective, not the 3 2/3 Amendment.

14:34.006 --> 14:37.078
Dr. Kelmer is entitled to its full protection.

14:37.110 --> 14:40.455
Well, if his wife is dead,
people won't see it that way.

14:40.480 --> 14:44.223
They'll see a judge protecting
a well-connected doctor.

14:44.250 --> 14:47.026
If I were you, I'd hedge my bets.

14:48.855 --> 14:51.165
I'll grant your warrant.

14:51.190 --> 14:53.500
But only for the auto.

14:53.526 --> 14:56.336
You want to poke around his apartment,

14:56.362 --> 15:00.037
you bring me probable cause on a platter.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.616
I like the blue. I do, too.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.777
It matches your eyes.

15:07.807 --> 15:11.380
I have to reschedule tomorrow afternoon.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.949
I'm getting together with my in-laws
to figure out the next move.

15:14.981 --> 15:16.961
Well, what about a private detective?

15:18.217 --> 15:20.663
If the police can't do anything,
maybe you should--

15:20.686 --> 15:23.633
Their incompetence amazes me.
I have to do everything.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.000
Why Valerie's doing this to me...

15:27.493 --> 15:29.302
My poor baby.

15:29.328 --> 15:31.308
Don't furrow your brow like that.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.139
Why? Am I getting lines?

15:33.166 --> 15:34.804
I can take care of them.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.815
And I'm going to do something
about those cheekbones.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.817
Aren't I beautiful enough for you?

15:39.839 --> 15:42.843
Well, why settle for beautiful
when you can have perfect?

15:45.478 --> 15:47.480
What room are you painting, anyway?

15:47.513 --> 15:49.356
The bathroom.

15:56.355 --> 15:58.961
No blood traces, no hair, no tissue.

15:58.991 --> 16:01.938
Car was detailed recently,
probably more than once.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.339
You can still smell the shampoo
in the floor mats.

16:04.363 --> 16:06.775
(phone ringing)

16:09.135 --> 16:13.447
Here's the receipt for aviation fuel from
Westchester Airport from two months ago.

16:13.473 --> 16:17.512
- He's a flyboy.
- Maybe he took his wife up for
a spin Sunday afternoon.

16:17.543 --> 16:20.649
Your doctor's bouncing off
the walls in the claims area.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.789
You steal my car, you rip it apart!

16:26.819 --> 16:29.459
Didn't you talk to the
witness who saw Valerie?!

16:29.489 --> 16:31.127
You know us, we're like dumb dogs.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.637
- We get a scent and we follow it.
- What scent is that?

16:33.659 --> 16:35.798
The husband's the obvious suspect.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.138
I've been nothing but cooperative with you.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.974
If you wanted to search my car,
all you had to do was ask.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.980
We appreciate it.

16:43.002 --> 16:46.006
Does it mean you'll consent
to a search of your apartment?

16:47.340 --> 16:51.345
You've exhausted my good will,
Detectives. Get a warrant.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.655
Couple of weeks ago, huh?

16:55.681 --> 16:57.490
Sunday. Yeah, I think so.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.430
Saturday he gave me crap
about not cleaning the plane.

17:00.453 --> 17:03.263
- Can we see the plane?
- Sure. It's over there.

17:03.289 --> 17:05.269
You get that a lot?

17:05.290 --> 17:07.271
Pilots giving you a hard time?

17:07.292 --> 17:09.102
Recreational pilots, you know.

17:09.127 --> 17:11.267
They all think they're Mercury astronauts.

17:11.297 --> 17:14.107
- Kelmer a good pilot?
- Instrument rated.

17:14.133 --> 17:15.612
But I wouldn't fly with him.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.944
Why not? Bad temper.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.450
Can we see his flight plan for Sunday?

17:20.473 --> 17:22.646
That's just it. He didn't file one.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.921
I got him renting a plane that Saturday,

17:27.946 --> 17:31.360
then the following Saturday,
nothing for Sunday.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.295
You keep records on the computer?

17:33.319 --> 17:35.731
I put them in the computer when I have time.

17:35.755 --> 17:38.133
I'm only one woman, sweetheart.

17:38.157 --> 17:39.898
Are you in here alone every day?

17:39.926 --> 17:42.668
Yes. From 7:00 to 6:00.

17:42.695 --> 17:45.335
Except when I have to go
to the little girl's room.

17:45.364 --> 17:48.641
- That's in the next building.
- You lock up?

17:48.668 --> 17:52.377
No. People got to get
to the vending machine.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.681
Do you always keep
the rental slips under there?

17:55.675 --> 17:58.155
Where I can get at them.

17:58.177 --> 18:01.090
- And so can everyone else.
- Thanks.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.494
I'm going to hire more people,
set up a phone bank,

18:05.518 --> 18:09.330
and I'm offering a reward of $10,000.

18:09.355 --> 18:11.357
$10,000.

18:11.390 --> 18:13.370
We'll find her, Eleanor.

18:14.994 --> 18:17.406
- What's wrong with her?
- You think we believe this?

18:17.430 --> 18:19.569
This act you're putting on?

18:19.599 --> 18:21.579
What did you do to my Valerie?

18:21.601 --> 18:23.808
Me?

18:23.836 --> 18:25.474
I can't look at you anymore.

18:25.504 --> 18:29.281
That's it, that's it. Go. You raised her.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.288
All her drugs, her mental problems,

18:31.310 --> 18:33.551
her screwing around, that's all on your head.

18:33.579 --> 18:36.059
God will punish you for what you've done.

18:36.082 --> 18:39.291
All I did was turn a shoe salesman's
daughter into a surgeon's wife.

18:39.318 --> 18:40.956
Did I ever hear any thanks from you?

18:40.987 --> 18:43.433
When do I get consideration
for what I'm going through?

18:49.328 --> 18:51.968
They make one accusation in public, I'll sue.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.306
You do that, Peter.

18:53.332 --> 18:55.437
Let the world see what a hypocrite you are.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.913
Valerie's the hypocrite.

18:56.936 --> 19:01.214
I'm no fool. They're be hell
to pay when she comes back.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.422
He left his apartment around 2:00

19:05.444 --> 19:07.720
and arrived at the hospital just before 5:00-

19:07.747 --> 19:08.885
roughly three hours.

19:08.914 --> 19:11.053
We're giving him half an hour to Westchester,

19:11.083 --> 19:14.428
15 minutes to get the plane ready,
assume the same on the other end.

19:14.453 --> 19:16.433
That leaves an hour and half flying time.

19:16.455 --> 19:19.459
A Cessna Turbo Stationaire makes 178 knots.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.268
That means he could cover this area.

19:22.294 --> 19:24.467
We're going with an ocean dump.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.068
Winds this time of year come from the north.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.807
That means the currents
are from east to west, onshore.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.008
Areas of search would be Long Island

19:32.038 --> 19:33.779
from Long Beach to Bridgehampton,

19:33.806 --> 19:37.310
and New Jersey from
Leonardo down to Cape May.

19:38.477 --> 19:40.479
Dibs on Long Island.

19:44.483 --> 19:46.292
Man: Forgive the facilities.

19:46.318 --> 19:49.265
Jersey legislature hasn't been very generous.

19:49.288 --> 19:52.963
Couple of joggers found her out
on the beach early Wednesday.

19:52.992 --> 19:57.134
I was going to get around
to an autopsy this weekend.

19:57.163 --> 20:00.144
Any idea on how long she'd been in the water?

20:00.166 --> 20:02.146
Two or three weeks.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.817
Here you go.

20:06.839 --> 20:10.013
Female caucasian from the
ribcage to the shoulders.

20:13.345 --> 20:15.325
You've found something, haven't you?

20:15.347 --> 20:17.418
- You found Valerie.
- We're not sure.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.760
That's why we need her DNA to identify her.

20:19.785 --> 20:22.391
Oh my God. What did he do to her?

20:22.421 --> 20:25.163
We can't talk about it, I'm sorry.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.228
Did she ever leave a hair clip,

20:27.259 --> 20:29.136
a hairbrush, anything like that?

20:29.161 --> 20:32.540
Last time she was here
she used one of my hairbrushes.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.677
You'll let me know, won't you?

20:44.710 --> 20:46.519
We will.

20:46.545 --> 20:49.321
Please don't talk about this with anybody.

20:49.348 --> 20:52.852
Especially Dr. Kelmer.
The less he knows, the better.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.922
There was only one hair root on the brush,

20:54.954 --> 20:56.524
but it was enough.

20:56.555 --> 20:59.035
Your bathing beauty is not Valerie Kelmer.

20:59.058 --> 21:01.129
She died from inhaling salt-water,

21:01.160 --> 21:03.299
otherwise known as drowning.

21:03.329 --> 21:05.309
As for the missing bits,

21:05.331 --> 21:07.641
the arms were wrenched from their sockets,

21:07.666 --> 21:11.478
and the neck and lower torso
were severed by crushing blows.

21:11.504 --> 21:15.919
- From what? An ax?
- No, a ship's propeller.

21:15.941 --> 21:19.684
So let's check our status here. No
corpus dilecti, no evidence of foul play.

21:19.712 --> 21:23.854
No evidence Dr. Kelmer is guilty of anything
except being a son of a bitch.
I miss anything?

21:23.883 --> 21:27.990
- Kelmer's mystery flight Sunday.
- There was no rental slip for it,
no flight plan.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.863
Kelmer could've nicked the rental slip.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.960
No flight plan because he didn't file one.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.767
According to the mechanic,
who was no fan of the doctor's.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.570
Are you moving Dr. Kelmer
out of the suspect column?

21:37.596 --> 21:40.668
I don't think he should be
the only one on there.

21:40.699 --> 21:42.178
He's the only one that matters.

21:42.201 --> 21:44.681
The woman had boyfriends
coming out of her ears.

21:44.703 --> 21:47.684
She was doing coke, she had
a history of suicide attempts.

21:47.706 --> 21:50.687
He thinks we're idiots. He's playing with us.

21:50.709 --> 21:53.952
I want to shove a stick in
Kelmer's cage, see what he does.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.219
What do you got in mind?

21:55.247 --> 21:57.591
A leak to the media about finding a torso.

21:57.616 --> 22:00.119
We're going to tell her family
it's not her though, right?

22:01.053 --> 22:02.464
No, he could find out.

22:02.488 --> 22:05.196
I made a promise to her cousin.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.604
I got to go with Bobby on this one.

22:18.971 --> 22:21.679
- Paper says it's her.
- Might be her.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.985
They said the body had surgical cuts.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.614
Why did they say that?

22:26.645 --> 22:29.489
Are you really stupid enough to
believe everything you read?

22:29.515 --> 22:32.655
Valerie's probably on a beach
with one of her cokehead boyfriends

22:32.685 --> 22:35.063
having a big laugh
because my life's a nightmare.

22:35.087 --> 22:37.761
She's a vindictive bitch.
Didn't I tell you that?

22:40.860 --> 22:44.034
If you really think I'm capable
of butchering her,

22:44.063 --> 22:46.134
maybe we should just end this.

22:46.165 --> 22:50.170
- No, Peter, please.
- I've had it with recriminations and
suspicions from Valerie.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.546
I don't need it from my next wife.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.015
Next wife?

22:56.041 --> 22:58.021
I'm divorcing Valerie.

22:59.011 --> 23:02.857
Once this is over, I'm moving my practice
to Boulder, and I want you to come with me.

23:04.316 --> 23:06.421
Oh, Peter, this is so sudden.

23:06.452 --> 23:08.591
Yes or no?

23:10.055 --> 23:12.194
Yes.

23:12.224 --> 23:16.297
Yes, I'll go with you. Yes, yes!

23:27.006 --> 23:29.008
Dr. Kelmer's on his way up.

23:55.367 --> 23:58.314
Sorry, just give me a minute here.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.749
Have a seat.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.777
What did you want to talk to us about?

24:04.810 --> 24:07.051
What was in the newspapers yesterday?

24:07.079 --> 24:08.956
We apologize for that.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.619
Somebody jumped the gun.

24:10.649 --> 24:12.629
There's been no positive ID.

24:12.651 --> 24:15.632
If there were one, you'd be
the first person we'd contact.

24:15.654 --> 24:17.565
So you haven't identified this body?

24:17.589 --> 24:19.569
No.

24:19.591 --> 24:23.129
- It's a difficult ID.
- What about fingerprints?

24:23.162 --> 24:25.802
It would help if there were fingers.

24:25.831 --> 24:28.311
What? The arms were cut off?

24:28.334 --> 24:30.974
We'd rather not discuss details right now

24:31.003 --> 24:33.040
until we have an identification.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.313
I can take a look and tell you
in a second if it's her.

24:35.341 --> 24:36.979
I'm a doctor. I'm not squeamish.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.579
It's not necessary. We appreciate it.

24:38.610 --> 24:42.183
Have you determined a cause of
death? Was it a suicide?

24:42.214 --> 24:46.424
Doctor, as I told you, until we have an ID--

24:46.452 --> 24:48.329
Damn it, it's like pulling teeth.

24:48.354 --> 24:49.992
I've told you everything I know,

24:50.022 --> 24:51.501
and you are telling me nothing.

24:51.523 --> 24:53.867
Is it because you're not making any progress?

24:53.892 --> 24:56.532
Fine. You really want to help us?

24:56.562 --> 24:59.372
How about answering a few questions?

25:05.804 --> 25:07.647
Go ahead.

25:09.808 --> 25:12.152
The Sunday your wife disappeared,

25:12.177 --> 25:15.351
you were seen in a garage putting
something in your trunk. What was it?

25:16.315 --> 25:18.795
My briefcase. I was going to work.

25:18.817 --> 25:20.956
I think I told you that.

25:20.986 --> 25:23.466
What time did you get to the hospital?

25:25.491 --> 25:28.335
I don't remember. Is this an interrogation?

25:28.360 --> 25:30.806
If it were one, we'd be
in the interrogation room.

25:30.829 --> 25:33.639
- When'd you get your pilot's license?
- Six years ago.

25:33.665 --> 25:36.646
- What does that --
- Do you fly every weekend?

25:36.668 --> 25:39.308
Yes. To relieve the stress.

25:39.338 --> 25:42.148
Sunday, after you put
your briefcase in your trunk,

25:42.174 --> 25:44.984
you drove to Westchester
Airport, isn't that right?

25:45.010 --> 25:47.490
Now you are interrogating me.

25:47.513 --> 25:49.823
I feel I should have an attorney.

25:49.848 --> 25:51.759
Why?

25:51.784 --> 25:53.695
You don't want to be helpful anymore?

25:53.719 --> 25:55.824
No. No, that's not it.

25:55.854 --> 25:59.927
Are we getting into an area
that's making you uncomfortable?

26:01.126 --> 26:03.128
No, the questions are fine.

26:09.968 --> 26:12.107
Okay.

26:12.137 --> 26:13.946
I didn't go to Westchester.

26:13.972 --> 26:16.953
About this body, you really want
to help us identify it?

26:16.975 --> 26:20.252
- Yes.
- We need a sample of your wife's DNA.

26:20.279 --> 26:23.419
She hasn't had any blood work in...

26:23.449 --> 26:26.555
Anything-- strands of hair from her brushes--

26:26.585 --> 26:29.225
She cleaned her brushes and combs every day.

26:29.254 --> 26:30.562
It was almost compulsive.

26:33.225 --> 26:35.262
I'm sure our technicians could

26:35.294 --> 26:37.274
find something in your apartment.

26:40.499 --> 26:42.376
You want to search my apartment?

26:42.401 --> 26:45.507
You said that you wanted
to helps us identify the body.

26:49.174 --> 26:51.916
As long as I can be there, be my guest.

26:57.683 --> 26:59.321
Fresh paint.

26:59.351 --> 27:01.592
- You had this room painted.
- Yes, last week.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.600
Valerie hates what was there before,

27:03.622 --> 27:05.659
but I thought-- it's going to sound stupid,

27:05.691 --> 27:08.433
but I thought if I paint it
the way she likes, she'll come back.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.339
She hates the bathmats, too?
I noticed these are all new.

27:11.363 --> 27:14.936
Valerie dropped a bottle
of nail polish before she...

27:14.967 --> 27:17.641
I just got around to replacing them.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.615
What are they doing?

27:22.641 --> 27:25.247
Checking the plumbing for your
wife's hair. Do you mind?

27:25.277 --> 27:27.655
As long as they don't break anything.

27:29.515 --> 27:32.223
Pipes look as new as the day
they were installed.

27:32.251 --> 27:34.197
Same story with the grouting.

27:34.219 --> 27:35.994
Either he didn't cut her up in here,

27:36.021 --> 27:38.160
or he went over this place with a toothbrush

27:38.190 --> 27:39.863
and some heavy duty cleansers.

27:39.892 --> 27:42.702
The kind of cleanser that might
be used in an operating room?

27:42.728 --> 27:45.402
Yeah, like that. They have
stuff that'll eat anything.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.981
It's called Virex 256.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.643
There's dozens of bottles
of it in the OR prep.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.982
Dr. Kelmer have access to it?

27:56.008 --> 27:58.716
He has access to whatever he wants.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.123
You want to tell me about it?

28:11.123 --> 28:13.933
He has women coming into
his office all day long

28:13.959 --> 28:15.495
taking their clothes off.

28:15.527 --> 28:19.100
- He takes advantage?
- Somebody thought he did.

28:19.131 --> 28:21.008
What do you mean?

28:21.033 --> 28:24.776
A few weeks ago, I met Kelmer for
lunch, for my bi-annual review.

28:24.803 --> 28:27.010
After he dropped me off at my car,

28:27.039 --> 28:28.575
while I was getting in,

28:28.607 --> 28:31.781
I saw a man writing down
my license plate number.

28:31.810 --> 28:34.552
I guarantee you, no one's following me.

28:36.782 --> 28:39.456
Valerie wouldn't hire
a detective to follow Peter.

28:39.484 --> 28:41.122
Didn't she think he was cheating?

28:41.153 --> 28:42.826
Well, she wasn't sure.

28:46.658 --> 28:49.332
That's not what you told us.

28:51.129 --> 28:54.269
You said that she knew there was someone.

28:54.299 --> 28:56.142
How did she know?

28:56.168 --> 28:57.875
Maybe I overstated.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.883
Ms. Barish...

29:00.939 --> 29:03.681
You hired the detective, didn't you?

29:08.947 --> 29:11.257
I thought if Valerie saw the truth

29:11.283 --> 29:13.092
that she'd have to end it with Peter.

29:13.118 --> 29:16.099
What did the detective find out?

29:16.121 --> 29:18.761
He saw Peter kissing another woman.

29:18.790 --> 29:22.033
Someone at the hospital. I don't know who.

29:22.060 --> 29:24.904
The detective told me
on Friday that he had the photos.

29:24.930 --> 29:28.104
That was the Friday before Valerie...

29:28.133 --> 29:30.443
I told him to send them to her.

29:30.469 --> 29:32.608
I don't know if she ever got them.

29:32.638 --> 29:35.619
The doorman at Valerie's
building said he gave Dr. Kelmer

29:35.641 --> 29:38.781
a large envelope addressed
to her that Saturday.

29:42.981 --> 29:44.983
He gave it to Peter?

29:48.654 --> 29:50.793
He must've seen the photos and...

29:53.358 --> 29:55.497
Oh my God!

29:56.728 --> 29:59.004
What did I do?

30:02.834 --> 30:05.314
Lisa Voight? I'm Detective Eames.

30:05.337 --> 30:07.317
This is Detective Goren,

30:07.339 --> 30:10.513
and this is a warrant allowing
us to search your apartment.

30:12.844 --> 30:15.154
What are you looking for exactly?

30:15.180 --> 30:17.182
It's all on the warrant.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.830
Do you know a Dr. Peter Kelmer?

30:20.852 --> 30:22.661
Yes.

30:22.688 --> 30:25.134
I'm an administrator
at the hospital where he works.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.693
I don't mean to be rude.

30:26.725 --> 30:28.932
Are you intimately involved with him?

30:30.062 --> 30:34.374
We work together. Any relationship
we have is strictly business.

30:36.134 --> 30:38.774
We got these photos from
a private investigator.

30:38.804 --> 30:41.614
This thing you're doing
to the doctor with your tongue,

30:41.640 --> 30:43.483
what business is that, strictly?

30:45.544 --> 30:47.683
Gray T-shirt with black trim,

30:47.713 --> 30:49.386
and...

30:50.515 --> 30:52.927
Been to Sarni's Delicatessen lately?

31:03.829 --> 31:07.299
Peter said if someone saw Valerie,
the police would have to stop

31:07.332 --> 31:09.972
wasting their time looking
for murder suspects.

31:10.001 --> 31:11.981
He's convinced you she's alive?

31:12.003 --> 31:15.314
Of course she's alive. She's hiding.

31:15.340 --> 31:17.342
She likes torturing Peter.

31:19.344 --> 31:20.982
In your apartment we found

31:21.012 --> 31:23.151
a real estate pamphlet for Boulder.

31:23.181 --> 31:25.957
- Are you moving there?
- Yes, with Peter.

31:25.984 --> 31:29.454
We're getting married
after he divorces Valerie.

31:30.455 --> 31:33.334
These other pamphlets about
cosmetic surgery, is that for you?

31:33.358 --> 31:35.668
Yes.

31:35.694 --> 31:40.336
- Dr. Kelmer's idea?
- Yes.

31:41.366 --> 31:44.210
Before you met Dr. Kelmer,
did you think you needed surgery?

31:44.236 --> 31:47.308
Peter has an eye for this kind of thing.

31:50.041 --> 31:52.521
You're a very beautiful woman.

31:52.544 --> 31:55.718
Did you try telling Peter that he's wrong?

31:58.550 --> 32:00.655
He's never wrong, is he?

32:03.321 --> 32:06.530
Of course I tried Lisa at
home. If she calls in,

32:06.558 --> 32:08.834
tell her Dr. Kelmer's
looking for her, all right?

32:08.860 --> 32:11.898
Hello, Doctor. You're under arrest
for the murder of your wife.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.410
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm going to handcuff you.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.310
- Just relax.
- Don't tell me what to do.

32:16.334 --> 32:18.644
- Hey, hey, down, boy.
- You're hurting me.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.980
- Settle down.
- You stupid idiots.

32:21.006 --> 32:24.010
Sticks and stones. Let's go.

32:31.349 --> 32:34.057
Okay, Doc, this is an interrogation.

32:36.721 --> 32:38.325
First thing,

32:38.356 --> 32:40.358
you sit here.

32:44.362 --> 32:49.243
You want the people on the other side of
that mirror to see my face? That's okay.

32:52.204 --> 32:54.707
I don't have anything to hide.

33:00.979 --> 33:04.222
Doctor, you're a very smart guy.

33:04.249 --> 33:06.229
Do you recognize this?

33:06.251 --> 33:08.128
It's a gray T-shirt with a black trim.

33:08.153 --> 33:10.861
Looks like what my wife was wearing
when she disappeared.

33:10.889 --> 33:13.961
How about that? This wig?

33:15.494 --> 33:18.031
Okay, you found these things at Lisa Voight's.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.805
You have her under arrest, is that it?

33:22.834 --> 33:26.543
I'm sure she explained our little
ruse and why it was necessary.

33:26.571 --> 33:28.881
Yes, you trained her very well.

33:30.509 --> 33:33.149
- I beg your pardon?
- Peter, let it go.

33:33.178 --> 33:36.057
No. He insulted a close friend of mine.

33:36.081 --> 33:38.891
She believes everything you tell her.

33:38.917 --> 33:43.059
She's giving up her life
to follow you to Colorado?

33:43.088 --> 33:45.159
She's even letting you hack into her face

33:45.190 --> 33:48.831
because you have an issue
with her cheekbones.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.840
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.342
Lisa Voight is in love with me.

33:53.365 --> 33:56.346
She's enthralled with you.
She's like a little puppy in your hands,

33:56.368 --> 33:58.405
pissing all over herself with excitement.

33:58.436 --> 34:00.473
- How dare you?
- But Valerie,

34:00.505 --> 34:02.576
Valerie didn't need you to feel alive.

34:02.607 --> 34:05.110
- She had her own boyfriends.
- You have no idea.

34:05.143 --> 34:06.986
Her own drugs, her own bad habits.

34:07.012 --> 34:08.491
You couldn't push her around.

34:08.513 --> 34:11.119
Where do you get these ridiculous ideas?

34:11.149 --> 34:13.150
You couldn't push her around, not like Lisa.

34:13.184 --> 34:14.356
She's under your thumb.

34:14.386 --> 34:15.922
That's where you like your women.

34:15.954 --> 34:17.797
Now, you just shut up!

34:17.822 --> 34:19.630
Valerie was a-- she was a...

34:27.165 --> 34:30.339
Okay, that's it. I'm
not saying anything else.

34:34.139 --> 34:37.813
I got a case without forensic
evidence, a case without--

34:37.842 --> 34:40.982
I can't even prove beyond a reasonable
doubt the victim is even dead.

34:41.012 --> 34:42.992
Everything he's done to cover his tracks

34:43.014 --> 34:44.652
is evidence of a guilty mind.

34:46.351 --> 34:48.331
Is there anything we might've missed?

34:48.353 --> 34:50.333
We took apart his car, the plane.

34:50.355 --> 34:53.165
We checked with air traffic control
along the eastern seaboard

34:53.190 --> 34:55.101
in case he turned up on somebody's radar.

34:55.126 --> 34:58.005
Short answer is, what you have now is all
the case you're gonna have.

34:58.029 --> 35:02.273
- "Trust me." Hell of a closing argument.
- He did it. You saw him.

35:02.300 --> 35:05.440
- You saw his rage.
- I did, Detective.

35:05.470 --> 35:08.451
But the jury never will,
and his lawyer is no fool.

35:08.473 --> 35:10.817
She'll never put him up on that stand.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.556
You put me on the stand.

35:18.683 --> 35:20.890
I'll get him up there.

35:27.192 --> 35:29.570
Dr. Kelmer made a point of telling us

35:29.594 --> 35:32.097
about his wife's psychiatric history,

35:32.130 --> 35:34.974
previous suicide attempts, drug use.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.641
He then gave us a list of his
wife's family and friends.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.651
Over 200 names and addresses

35:41.673 --> 35:43.653
in alphabetical order.

35:43.675 --> 35:46.485
- I found this odd.
- Why is that?

35:46.511 --> 35:49.822
Well, the man's wife
was allegedly missing.

35:49.848 --> 35:52.158
Any normal person would be far too upset

35:52.183 --> 35:55.164
or distracted to make alphabetical lists.

35:55.186 --> 35:57.666
Objection. He isn't qualified
to offer his opinion.

35:57.689 --> 36:01.933
Yes, sustained. The jury will
disregard the witness' last response.

36:01.960 --> 36:05.066
Carver: After interviewing Dr.
Kelmer, what did you do next?

36:05.096 --> 36:07.633
We interviewed the victim's cousin,
Jennifer Barish.

36:07.666 --> 36:10.476
She told us that Valerie 's therapist

36:10.502 --> 36:13.972
had warned her that some day
her husband was going to harm her.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.747
- Objection. Hearsay.
- Judge: Sustained.

36:16.775 --> 36:20.382
Detective, I know this isn't the first
time you've testified in court.

36:20.412 --> 36:22.585
The jury again will disregard.

36:22.614 --> 36:25.060
Did there come a time
when you had the opportunity

36:25.083 --> 36:26.892
to search Dr. Kelmer's apartment?

36:26.918 --> 36:29.296
- Yes.
- What, if anything, did you find?

36:29.320 --> 36:31.459
The bathtub drains in the master bathroom

36:31.489 --> 36:35.301
had been cleaned with Virex 256,
the same detergent

36:35.326 --> 36:38.466
used to clean the operating rooms
at Dr. Kelmer's hospital.

36:38.496 --> 36:41.170
And this was confirmed
by one of Dr. Kelmer's nurses,

36:41.199 --> 36:44.305
who also accused the doctor
of cheating on his wife--

36:44.335 --> 36:46.815
Objection! Your Honor, this is unbelievable.

36:46.838 --> 36:48.476
Yes, yes, Ms. Barbera.

36:48.506 --> 36:50.417
Detective, one more like that,

36:50.442 --> 36:52.581
you're off the stand.

36:52.610 --> 36:54.988
Again, the jury is instructed to disregard

36:55.013 --> 36:56.492
the witness 's comments.

36:56.514 --> 36:57.959
Go on, Mr. Carver.

36:57.982 --> 37:01.623
Detective, I'm directing you to
confine your answers to my questions.

37:01.653 --> 37:04.065
- Yes, sir.
- Now, what else, if anything,

37:04.089 --> 37:06.797
did you find in your search
of Dr. Kelmer's apartment?

37:06.825 --> 37:09.305
We found the bathmats had been replaced

37:09.327 --> 37:10.863
and the bathroom repainted.

37:10.895 --> 37:13.432
Did the defendant offer an explanation?

37:13.465 --> 37:16.378
Just a lot of double-talk, Mr. Carver.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.381
There's really only one conclusion.

37:18.403 --> 37:21.282
He tried to hide the evidence
of a horrible crime.

37:21.306 --> 37:23.616
- Murder and dismemberment--
- Objection!

37:23.641 --> 37:26.315
- There's no other explanation!
- That's enough.

37:26.344 --> 37:28.551
If there is, I'm sure we'd
all love to hear it!

37:37.155 --> 37:39.135
Do you take me for a moron?

37:39.157 --> 37:40.966
They heard what they heard.

37:40.992 --> 37:42.869
If I was on that jury, I'd convict me.

37:42.894 --> 37:44.965
I want to respond.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.532
I want to tell the jury my story.

37:46.564 --> 37:49.807
No, I can't advise you
more strongly against this.

37:49.834 --> 37:52.144
The prosecutor will crucify you.

37:52.170 --> 37:54.480
( scoffs )
He's a civil servant, Lauren.

37:54.506 --> 37:56.645
How tough can he be?

37:56.674 --> 37:58.517
Now, help get me ready.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.259
I felt the police had just given up

38:03.281 --> 38:04.555
on finding Valerie alive.

38:04.582 --> 38:07.756
I felt I had to do something
to keep them looking for her.

38:07.786 --> 38:10.767
I didn't care how suspicious it looked.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.928
I'd been totally open with the police.

38:12.957 --> 38:15.096
I'd given them all the information I had.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.265
I allowed them to search my apartment.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.434
And still Valerie's missing,

38:19.464 --> 38:21.535
and no one knows what happened to her.

38:21.566 --> 38:23.773
You didn't tell police you had a mistress.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.645
No.

38:26.805 --> 38:30.480
It's not easy to admit that
in spite of my feelings for Valerie,

38:30.508 --> 38:32.044
our marriage was in trouble.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.589
Dr. Kelmer, did you kill

38:34.612 --> 38:37.252
or cause to be killed,
your wife, Valerie Kelmer?

38:38.249 --> 38:42.720
No. As God is my witness...

38:43.988 --> 38:45.262
NO.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.303
Doctor,

38:51.329 --> 38:53.468
an earlier witness quoted you as saying

38:53.498 --> 38:55.637
that with a couple of well-placed cuts,

38:55.667 --> 38:57.305
you could remove an arm

38:57.335 --> 39:01.579
as effortlessly as a wing
on a Thanksgiving turkey.

39:02.774 --> 39:05.380
Would you mind showing us
where those cuts would be?

39:05.410 --> 39:07.083
Objection. Relevance.

39:07.111 --> 39:09.887
I'll allow it, subject to connection.
Go ahead, Doctor.

39:14.953 --> 39:17.331
Across that group of muscles right there.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.564
The deltoid, teres and pectoralis muscle?

39:21.659 --> 39:25.266
- Kelmer: Yes.
- The People's 47 through 64.

39:25.296 --> 39:29.073
These are the knives the police
found in your apartment.

39:29.100 --> 39:33.810
Now, to cut those muscles,
what's the best knife?

39:33.838 --> 39:36.011
The serrated one,

39:36.040 --> 39:38.247
or the boning knife here?

39:39.644 --> 39:42.488
- Which one, Doctor?
- Either one, I guess.

39:42.513 --> 39:44.754
I don't want you to guess.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.694
The boning knife would be fine.

39:47.719 --> 39:50.427
As a surgeon, what's the
right stroke? Like this?

39:51.422 --> 39:53.333
Only if you wanted to sprain your wrist.

39:53.358 --> 39:56.532
Ah. Please demonstrate the proper technique.

40:03.701 --> 40:05.544
You find this amusing, Doctor?

40:11.342 --> 40:13.185
Show us.

40:19.183 --> 40:22.756
Carver: You put a lot of thought
into your surgeries, don't you?

40:22.787 --> 40:24.562
Every incision is mapped out?

40:24.589 --> 40:26.000
Yes, of course.

40:27.225 --> 40:31.696
You bring the same attention to detail
to your flying, even to making lists.

40:31.729 --> 40:33.333
Now, that's not fair.

40:33.364 --> 40:35.503
I'm methodical and thorough,

40:35.533 --> 40:38.207
but you can't draw inferences from that.

40:38.236 --> 40:40.011
If you're so methodical and thorough,

40:40.038 --> 40:43.679
how did you end up married to a
promiscuous, suicidal drug addict?

40:43.708 --> 40:45.346
I resent that.

40:45.376 --> 40:47.378
Marrying Valerie was not a mistake.

40:47.412 --> 40:50.689
Well, she's missing, and you're
here on trial for her murder.

40:50.715 --> 40:54.185
- Wouldn't you say something went wrong?
- I did not make a mistake.

40:54.218 --> 40:56.459
She's the one doing drugs and sleeping around.

40:56.487 --> 40:58.057
She walked out on the marriage.

40:58.089 --> 41:00.865
How about severing a leg at the knee?
What muscles would you cut?

41:00.892 --> 41:03.930
- What?
- What muscles would you cut?

41:06.431 --> 41:10.038
The gracilis and vastus muscles.

41:10.068 --> 41:13.675
Before she met you, Valerie had never
traveled outside the country, right?

41:13.705 --> 41:15.343
Furthest she'd been was New Jersey.

41:15.373 --> 41:19.287
- Never been to a charity ball, eaten at a
four-star restaurant?
- No, of course not.

41:19.310 --> 41:22.814
Marrying a well-respected
plastic surgeon was a big step up.

41:22.847 --> 41:25.293
- I would think so.
- And she showed her gratitude

41:25.316 --> 41:27.819
by buying drugs with your money,

41:27.852 --> 41:29.593
having sex with strangers?

41:29.620 --> 41:33.033
- You'd have to ask her.
- Painters, personal trainers?

41:33.057 --> 41:35.833
- See what I put up with?
- You're no angel yourself, Doctor.

41:35.860 --> 41:38.568
You have affairs with all the hospital staff.

41:38.596 --> 41:41.099
Just with one individual.

41:41.132 --> 41:43.476
Her behavior drove you to have an affair.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.572
Yes, of course.

41:48.039 --> 41:51.543
- She made you do this.
- Yes.

41:51.576 --> 41:54.580
When you saw this, you thought
how dare she have you followed?

41:54.612 --> 41:57.252
How dare she question what you do?!

41:57.281 --> 41:58.555
Yes, yes.

41:58.583 --> 42:01.029
She is trying to get power
over you, this ingrate,

42:01.052 --> 42:03.123
this nobody who'd never been anywhere!

42:03.154 --> 42:05.794
- How dare she?!
- This is all your fault!

42:05.823 --> 42:07.928
You stupid cow!

42:07.959 --> 42:09.302
You and your low-rent family,

42:09.327 --> 42:11.637
you just couldn't mind your own damn business!

42:11.662 --> 42:13.608
You just had to meddle!

42:36.587 --> 42:37.895
Judge: Madam Foreman,

42:37.922 --> 42:39.799
on the sole count of the indictment,

42:39.824 --> 42:41.735
murder in the second degree,

42:41.759 --> 42:43.136
how do you find?

42:43.161 --> 42:45.664
We the jury in the above entitled action,

42:45.696 --> 42:49.041
find the defendant, Peter Kelmer, guilty.

43:10.154 --> 43:11.963
Did you see his face?

43:11.989 --> 43:14.833
- He couldn't believe it.
- He's not the only one.

43:14.859 --> 43:16.634
He wasn't convicted on the evidence.

43:16.661 --> 43:18.937
He was convicted because
the jury didn't like him.

43:18.963 --> 43:21.136
I make my living putting
my trust in juries.

43:21.165 --> 43:22.610
Now is not the time to stop.

43:22.633 --> 43:24.340
I'll take them any way they come.
