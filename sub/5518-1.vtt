HAPPY GILMORE

00:52.970 --> 00:55.138
My name is Happy Gilmore.

00:55.389 --> 00:59.226
Ever since I was old enough to skate,
I loved hockey.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.980
I wasn't really
the greatest skater.

01:03.814 --> 01:06.733
But that didn't keep my dad
from teaching me...

01:06.942 --> 01:09.319
...the secret of making
a great slap shot.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.867
My dad worshipped hockey.
My mom didn't.

01:15.284 --> 01:20.163
So she moved to Egypt, where there's
not a hockey rink within 1500 miles.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.917
Dad took me to games
to see our favorite player...

01:24.251 --> 01:26.545
...Terry O'Reilly,
"The Tasmanian Devil".

01:26.753 --> 01:30.924
He wasn't a big guy,
but he feared nobody, just like me.

01:31.341 --> 01:35.929
Handsome fellow, huh? He said
when I grew up, I could be anything.

01:36.263 --> 01:39.349
But all I ever wanted to be
was a hockey player.

01:40.517 --> 01:45.022
My childhood was going great,
but life is full of surprises.

01:52.821 --> 01:57.701
After the funeral, I was sent to live
with my grandma in Waterbury.

02:03.665 --> 02:06.793
I was nervous,
since I didn't know her that well.

02:07.836 --> 02:11.298
She dressed like Gene Simmons
from KISS to cheer me up.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.384
She's the sweetest person
in the world.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.891
After my dad died,
I developed a short fuse.

02:21.058 --> 02:23.060
That kid stole my party blower.

02:23.393 --> 02:27.439
Instead of asking for it back,
I hit him in the head repeatedly...

02:27.564 --> 02:28.398
with a hammer.

02:28.982 --> 02:32.569
Most of the time, I was quick to say
I was sorry.

02:34.446 --> 02:38.075
Years later, I played junior hockey
and still hold two league records...

02:38.367 --> 02:40.369
...most time spent
in a penalty box...

02:40.577 --> 02:44.873
...and I was the only guy to ever try
to stab someone with his skates.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.837
After I graduated, I had
a lot of different jobs.

02:49.962 --> 02:51.338
I was a road worker...

02:53.507 --> 02:55.092
...a janitor...

02:58.929 --> 03:00.931
...a security guard...

03:04.351 --> 03:06.520
...a gas station attendant...

03:09.773 --> 03:11.525
...and a plumber.

03:12.693 --> 03:16.530
Lately, I've been working
construction. It's not bad.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.740
I'm a good shot
with a nail gun.

03:19.032 --> 03:24.037
But one day my boss, Mr. Larson,
got in the way.

03:24.997 --> 03:29.042
Apparently, he also has a short fuse.
Look at the monster.

03:29.710 --> 03:33.547
He got in a few lucky punches,
but I feel I won the fight.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.716
Anyway, those jobs
weren't for me.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.887
I was put on this planet
for one reason... to play hockey.

03:41.388 --> 03:45.559
It's my puck, baby!
Don't you ever touch my puck!

03:46.059 --> 03:50.564
Is that Gilmore again?
How many times has he tried out?

03:50.856 --> 03:52.232
At least ten times.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.484
He has a lot of intensity.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.363
Not a strong skater, though.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.240
Nor the best puck handler.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.163
But, my God...

04:09.750 --> 04:11.418
What a shot.

04:12.544 --> 04:17.007
It that goal regulation size
or what?!

04:21.303 --> 04:22.971
Number one...

04:23.514 --> 04:26.600
...number fifty-two... number sixteen...

04:26.934 --> 04:29.937
They saw my power.
They won't dog me this year.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.188
...number nine...

04:32.147 --> 04:35.901
...and number forty-three.
The rest of you...

04:36.193 --> 04:38.529
...better luck next year.

04:39.029 --> 04:42.157
Coach, what's going on?
What about me?

04:42.574 --> 04:43.825
Gilmore.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.037
I called your number,
didn't I?

04:47.371 --> 04:48.956
No, you didn't.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.459
Well, better luck next year.

04:53.544 --> 04:55.629
That wasn't very nice!

05:02.177 --> 05:04.054
You think you're better
than me?!

05:09.476 --> 05:11.019
Where you going?
I got Subway.

05:11.353 --> 05:12.604
I already ate.

05:13.021 --> 05:16.567
I knew the guy working there,
so we got extra meatballs.

05:16.775 --> 05:18.652
Great. I got to run.

05:18.861 --> 05:21.071
Can you stay?
I had a rough day.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.072
Bye.

05:22.406 --> 05:24.074
- When will you be back?
- Never.

05:30.956 --> 05:31.874
Terry, wait!

05:32.207 --> 05:34.918
Wait! Hold on a second, babe.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.046
You're not going for good,
are you?

05:38.338 --> 05:40.841
You're going nowhere
and taking me with you.

05:41.091 --> 05:46.096
All you ever talk about is being a pro
hockey player, but you're not any good.

05:46.388 --> 05:50.142
I am good! You know what?
You're a lousy kindergarten teacher!

05:50.434 --> 05:53.770
I saw the finger paintings
you bring home... they suck!

05:55.439 --> 06:00.027
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
They're excellent finger paintings.

06:00.569 --> 06:01.945
Please don't go.

06:02.237 --> 06:05.032
I'm not spending the rest of my life
with a loser.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.283
I'm gone.

06:06.408 --> 06:11.121
Good! Get the hell out of my life!
Who needs you? Beat it!

06:12.122 --> 06:14.124
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

06:14.458 --> 06:17.252
I just yell
'cause I get so scared.

06:17.669 --> 06:19.963
Scared of being a nobody.

06:20.297 --> 06:23.634
Why don't you come back
upstairs, honey?

06:23.926 --> 06:27.262
I'll give you the old smoochy-smoo
kissy-wissy.

06:28.639 --> 06:32.142
You know Happy
will make everything okay.

06:39.483 --> 06:42.986
I want to kiss you all over

06:43.529 --> 06:45.489
And over and again

06:46.448 --> 06:49.785
I want to kiss you all over

06:52.704 --> 06:55.499
Till the night closes in

06:56.333 --> 06:59.169
Till the night closes in

07:01.171 --> 07:02.172
Terry!

07:18.021 --> 07:20.023
Sit tight.
I'll be right over.

07:26.905 --> 07:29.700
Hey, you don't want breakfast?

07:39.626 --> 07:40.377
Grandma?

07:43.589 --> 07:45.799
Put that down!
It's my grandmother's!

07:46.091 --> 07:48.719
Cut it out, kid.
We're just doing our job.

07:49.011 --> 07:50.554
What are you talking about?

07:50.804 --> 07:53.390
Your grandmother
hasn't paid taxes in 10 years.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.312
Grandma, you didn't pay
your taxes?

07:58.604 --> 08:01.398
I would have,
but I didn't have any money.

08:02.774 --> 08:04.318
Where are you taking her stuff?

08:04.651 --> 08:07.362
I'm not taking her stuff,
the government is.

08:07.571 --> 08:11.408
It's not like I'm taking her stuff
over to my place.

08:11.742 --> 08:13.076
Don't get mad at me.

08:13.410 --> 08:17.372
But she's an old lady.
Look at her. She's old.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.834
You can't just take her stuff.
She's too old.

08:21.126 --> 08:25.088
I'm sorry. I have no discretion.
Her stuff is now our stuff.

08:26.131 --> 08:28.926
Well, at least we got the house.

08:29.176 --> 08:32.679
I'll bring furniture from my place.
We'll be okay.

08:33.013 --> 08:36.433
Now you'll really be mad.
I'm taking the house, too.

08:36.767 --> 08:40.103
My grandfather built this house
with his bare hands.

08:40.312 --> 08:44.691
My grandma's been here over 60 years.
You can't take her house.

08:44.900 --> 08:49.613
Mrs. Gilmore owes the IRS
$270,000 in back taxes.

08:49.905 --> 08:52.282
We have to take the house.

08:52.616 --> 08:57.287
If you can't repay the money in 90
days, we sell the house to someone else.

08:57.621 --> 08:58.997
You hate me, don't you?

08:59.623 --> 09:01.083
No, I don't hate you.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.091
He hates me.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.221
Don't worry-
things will be okay.

09:14.930 --> 09:16.306
Look at this place.

09:16.598 --> 09:20.894
Silver Acres Rest Home.
It looks more like a country club.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.397
Nice grass, nice people.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.899
I hope you brought
your bathing suit.

09:26.275 --> 09:28.902
You're going to make friends
in no time.

09:29.236 --> 09:29.820
Mister!

09:30.988 --> 09:34.116
Get me out of here!!!

09:35.242 --> 09:38.287
Here, eat that!
Leave us alone!

09:39.663 --> 09:42.166
Grandma, you could come
live with me.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.751
Nonsense, dear.
You're a grown man.

09:45.043 --> 09:48.505
I wouldn't burden you
like that and that's final.

09:48.839 --> 09:51.758
Tell me, how is that nice girlfriend
of yours?

09:52.176 --> 09:54.261
She got hit by a car.
She's dead.

09:54.678 --> 09:58.432
Listen, I will get that $270,000
and get your house back.

09:58.849 --> 09:59.975
I promise.

10:00.184 --> 10:01.351
Oh, sure.

10:01.643 --> 10:05.606
In the meantime, just stay here
and have some fun.

10:06.023 --> 10:07.816
I will, dear. Don't worry.

10:09.443 --> 10:12.154
Pardon me,
but it's nap time.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.698
Nap time... that sounds nice.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.492
- You go.
- I love you.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.621
I love you, too, darling.

10:23.123 --> 10:26.668
Buddy, do me a favor.
You see that lady?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.171
She's very important to me.

10:29.463 --> 10:32.841
I want you to take
extra special care of her.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.718
You know what I mean?

10:35.010 --> 10:38.055
I can't accept that.
But this is what I can do.

10:38.347 --> 10:42.309
I can take extra special care
of that young lady for nothing.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.979
I appreciate that.

10:46.897 --> 10:48.482
Have a nice afternoon.

10:49.066 --> 10:53.862
Sir, could I trouble you for a glass of
warm milk? It helps put me to sleep.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.407
You could trouble me for a warm glass
of shut the hell up.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.703
Go to sleep
or I will put you to sleep.

11:01.912 --> 11:05.249
Check out the name tag.
You're in my world now, Grandma.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.251
Oh, dear.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.339
Bet you I can hit a ball
past that tree.

11:12.756 --> 11:14.716
Twenty bucks says you can't.

11:14.925 --> 11:17.970
Morons, I told you I want to watch
the hockey game.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.681
Cut the golf sissy crap
and finish up.

11:21.098 --> 11:22.015
Oh, relax.

11:22.349 --> 11:26.019
You can enjoy your grandma's
possessions for another half hour.

11:28.689 --> 11:31.441
Oh, you got a hold of that one!

11:31.525 --> 11:34.236
- You try it.
- It's not as easy as it looks.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.864
Sorry, ladies.
I'm not the golfing type.

11:37.155 --> 11:39.366
You hit a ball past my ball...

11:39.658 --> 11:43.120
...we'll finish work so you can watch
your hockey game.

11:43.412 --> 11:45.372
Give me the stupid club.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.130
Look at this stupid thing.

11:53.297 --> 11:56.884
This will be hilarious.
Look how he's standing.

11:57.593 --> 11:59.261
You like that?

12:13.317 --> 12:14.818
Holy shit.

12:15.110 --> 12:15.944
Back to work.

12:16.153 --> 12:18.030
That house is 400 yards away.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.156
Is that good?

12:19.489 --> 12:21.992
- That's unbelievable.
- Beginner's luck.

12:22.743 --> 12:24.494
I bet $20 you can't do it again.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.079
Bring it on.

12:39.510 --> 12:41.678
You boys are going to pay
for that...

12:44.097 --> 12:46.683
- You hit him!
- He shouldn't have been standing there.

12:47.017 --> 12:49.436
One more time.
Double or nothing.

12:49.603 --> 12:50.979
You better pay up.

13:01.198 --> 13:04.451
Oops. Maybe we should
get back inside.

13:04.868 --> 13:07.454
You made a bet.
Pay the man.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.391
Thanks. Tell your friends.

13:27.683 --> 13:29.643
Step right up, folks!

13:29.977 --> 13:34.773
See if you can outdrive the amazing
Golf Ball, uh, Whacker Guy!

13:37.693 --> 13:39.486
That's great.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.154
Very good.

13:42.281 --> 13:46.326
Bend your knees. Remember,
it's in the hips. You're doing great.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.245
It's in the hips.

13:48.537 --> 13:51.165
Fifty bucks I can hit it
over the highway.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.009
That's real good.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.512
So long, sucker.

14:10.434 --> 14:12.436
How often do you play?

14:12.603 --> 14:13.979
This is my first time.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.858
You should play
in the Waterbury Open tomorrow.

14:18.150 --> 14:20.110
Yeah, right, I'll see you there.

14:24.406 --> 14:26.074
He's going to play.

14:26.617 --> 14:28.869
And, by God,
he's going to win.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.215
Mister, you need a helmet.

14:41.507 --> 14:43.050
Don't worry about it.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.308
Yeah, bring that shit on.

14:52.226 --> 14:53.393
I love it.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.270
Awesome.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.898
God, that hurt,
but I'm okay.

14:58.315 --> 14:59.983
What the hell
are you doing?

15:00.150 --> 15:04.029
Just 364 more days till the next
hockey tryouts. I got to get tough.

15:06.323 --> 15:07.783
God, that felt good.

15:07.991 --> 15:10.285
Cut that out.
You're making me sick.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.581
So you're a hockey player.

15:14.998 --> 15:17.918
You got to give that up
and concentrate on golf.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.169
Who are you?

15:19.336 --> 15:21.839
I'm the club pro here...
Chubbs Peterson.

15:22.172 --> 15:26.426
I'm offering to teach you
how to play golf, personally, for free.

15:26.760 --> 15:27.678
No.

15:28.011 --> 15:29.763
You don't know who I am,
do you?

15:30.097 --> 15:31.348
No, I don't.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.767
Back in 1965...

15:34.184 --> 15:37.938
...Sports Illustrated said I would be
the next Arnold Palmer.

15:38.230 --> 15:39.189
What happened?

15:39.481 --> 15:41.692
I wasn't allowed
to play pro anymore.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.194
I'm sorry.
Because you're black?

15:44.486 --> 15:47.197
Hell, no.
An alligator bit my hand off.

15:47.614 --> 15:48.782
Oh, my God!

15:49.199 --> 15:52.536
Tournament in Florida.
My ball went down by a lake.

15:52.703 --> 15:56.999
Damn alligator just popped up!
Cut me down in my prime.

15:57.291 --> 16:01.587
But I tore one of that bastard's eyes
out. Look at that.

16:02.296 --> 16:03.964
You're pretty sick, Chubbs.

16:04.298 --> 16:05.883
I've never seen anyone...

16:06.049 --> 16:09.720
...who can hit the ball
half as far as you. You got real talent.

16:10.053 --> 16:14.516
That's nice of you to say, but
I trained all my life to play hockey.

16:14.808 --> 16:18.145
Golf is no different... requires talent,
self-discipline.

16:18.562 --> 16:21.064
Golf requires goofy pants
and a fat ass.

16:21.398 --> 16:24.234
Talk to my neighbor... a great golfer.
Huge ass.

16:24.526 --> 16:28.155
I bet your neighbor can't drive
the ball 400 yards.

16:28.488 --> 16:32.993
I bet your neighbor doesn't have a shot
to get on the Pro Tour.

16:33.911 --> 16:35.162
How would I do that?

16:35.496 --> 16:38.499
You win the Open tomorrow,
you're on the Pro Tour.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.919
Then, who knows? Maybe you'll win
the Tour Championship.

16:42.586 --> 16:44.254
Get that gold jacket
I never got.

16:44.755 --> 16:47.174
Gold jacket, green jacket...
who cares?

16:52.346 --> 16:55.516
Don't worry. It's made of wood...
real sturdy.

17:01.230 --> 17:03.190
Sorry about that.

17:03.524 --> 17:06.360
It was good to meet you,
but, uh...

17:08.111 --> 17:09.780
I'm out of here.

17:10.113 --> 17:12.199
This is not real smart, kid.

17:12.491 --> 17:15.828
I thought you were pro material,
primed for the big bucks.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.294
Hey, Chubbs...

17:24.586 --> 17:26.380
...what kind of big bucks?

17:33.470 --> 17:36.890
Stupid golf clubs.
Why the hell am I doing this?

17:40.727 --> 17:43.480
Whoa... must be Burt Reynolds
or something.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.401
Good morning!

17:47.943 --> 17:52.114
Isn't this great? Blue skies,
fresh-cut grass, birds chirping.

17:52.322 --> 17:56.785
You going to recite me a poem?
Geez, you love this golf stuff.

17:57.536 --> 18:00.873
A guy your size... why not play
a real sport, like football?

18:01.081 --> 18:04.334
My mama wouldn't let me.
Said it was too dangerous.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.295
Yeah, good call.

18:07.004 --> 18:08.505
Hey, who's that?

18:09.089 --> 18:12.968
The shorter guy is Doug Thompson,
president of the Tour.

18:13.260 --> 18:17.347
The other guy is Shooter McGavin,
leading money winner this year.

18:17.764 --> 18:18.932
Who's the girl?

18:19.099 --> 18:22.769
I'm Virginia Venit, Director
of Public Relations for the Tour.

18:23.103 --> 18:27.566
Of course. I've heard you've done
some really interesting things.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.611
Right now I'm working
on a promotion...

18:31.028 --> 18:34.448
You know what would be great?
If I could get a Pepsi.

18:34.990 --> 18:36.033
Sure.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.161
Oh, miss?

18:39.786 --> 18:40.704
Diet.

18:41.622 --> 18:42.998
Right.

18:44.041 --> 18:46.835
Hey, thanks for dressing up.

18:47.169 --> 18:50.797
If I wore clothes like those,
I'd have to kick my own ass.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.466
Good morning, everyone.

18:52.799 --> 18:57.471
Welcome to the Waterbury Open.
Before we begin, I have a treat for you.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.015
Ladies and gentlemen,
Shooter McGavin.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.775
Thank you, Doug.
I saw Doug play yesterday.

19:09.983 --> 19:13.445
He spends more time in the sand
than David Hasselhoff.

19:13.862 --> 19:16.365
Let me get serious.
You're all aware...

19:16.573 --> 19:20.744
...today's winner will be invited
to join the Pro Tour.

19:21.078 --> 19:23.747
Although only one will become
my colleague...

19:24.081 --> 19:26.166
...all of you are now my friends.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.214
Thank you.
Now go get 'em!

19:34.716 --> 19:39.721
Next up: Lafferty, Daniel
and Gilmore... Happy.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.434
Where you taking
those clubs, punk?!

19:46.812 --> 19:48.480
Mr. Gilmore,
I'm your caddy.

19:48.897 --> 19:51.191
Sorry. I'll carry these.

19:51.275 --> 19:53.360
They're my grandfather's.
They're pretty old.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.405
What should I do then?

19:56.697 --> 19:58.907
Why don't you just watch me...

19:59.116 --> 20:01.910
...and make sure
I don't do anything stupid?

20:04.538 --> 20:07.374
Mr. Gilmore, Mr. Lafferty
is teeing off now.

20:07.541 --> 20:09.543
Okay. Good luck, buddy.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.796
Get out of the way.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.223
Where were you that time,
dipshit?

20:37.070 --> 20:39.448
Probably the best I'll hit
all day.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.533
Mr. Gilmore, you're up.

21:03.847 --> 21:04.932
Damn it!

21:07.017 --> 21:08.018
Time!

21:08.852 --> 21:12.022
Relax. Do what we discussed.
Don't look at the green.

21:12.314 --> 21:15.442
Hit the ball. There's no goalie
anywhere to block it.

21:15.776 --> 21:19.279
Remember, it's all in the hip.
Come on. Work with me.

21:19.613 --> 21:22.950
It's all in the hips.
All in the hips.

21:23.367 --> 21:25.786
It's all in the hips.

21:26.203 --> 21:27.120
Get off me!

21:27.412 --> 21:30.374
Just easing the tension.
Just easing the tension.

21:30.666 --> 21:32.876
Well, ease it on someone else.

21:51.311 --> 21:52.980
What the hell?

21:56.817 --> 21:59.152
Good. Now we just worry
about putting.

21:59.570 --> 22:00.988
Oh, yeah. Putting.

22:02.990 --> 22:04.950
Remember what I said.

22:05.284 --> 22:08.203
Use your shoulders
to push the ball, not the arms.

22:08.412 --> 22:10.080
Don't break the wrist.

22:10.414 --> 22:14.668
Whoa, you're confusing me.
Just let me put the ball in the hole.

22:29.683 --> 22:30.726
Is he kidding?

22:51.288 --> 22:52.706
This is pathetic.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.055
Good shot.

23:08.472 --> 23:09.389
It's about time.

23:09.640 --> 23:14.228
True. I just couldn't get the ball in
the hole. I wanted to, but I couldn't.

23:45.175 --> 23:47.594
He shoots, he scores!

23:48.095 --> 23:53.016
That was much easier than putting.
I should try and do that every time.

23:53.308 --> 23:54.685
Good plan.

23:54.852 --> 23:56.854
- Did you see that?
- Yes. Nice.

23:57.187 --> 23:59.690
He got a hole in one
on a par four.

23:59.857 --> 24:01.233
I said I saw it.

24:01.441 --> 24:04.695
I hope he wins.
He's a publicist's dream.

24:04.987 --> 24:09.283
A guy who can drive the ball
that far... he could really draw a crowd.

24:09.575 --> 24:13.537
So could a golfer with an arm
growing out of his ass.

25:25.359 --> 25:28.946
Now, you make this one
in four or less shots...

25:29.238 --> 25:30.697
...you win the tournament.

25:30.906 --> 25:31.865
Four shots.

25:32.866 --> 25:36.870
Think of it this way. The other team
has pulled their goalie.

25:37.287 --> 25:40.707
It's wide open.
All you have to do is tap it in.

25:41.542 --> 25:43.126
I can do that.

26:02.396 --> 26:04.565
Don't worry.
You're doing fine.

26:04.898 --> 26:08.569
All you have to do is tap it in.
Just tap it in.

26:09.570 --> 26:11.780
Just tap it in.

26:18.162 --> 26:22.749
Just tap it in. Just tap it in.
Give it a little tappy.

26:23.167 --> 26:24.585
Tap, tap, tap-a-roo.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.424
Grandma, Grandma...

26:30.757 --> 26:32.926
...Grandma, Grandma.

26:36.180 --> 26:37.639
All right!

26:48.692 --> 26:51.111
He's going to be on the Tour.
Super.

26:54.615 --> 26:56.533
That's cute.

26:57.451 --> 27:02.372
Mr. Gilmore, Virginia Venit.
I'm P.R. Director of the Tour.

27:02.664 --> 27:03.624
Nice to meet you.

27:03.916 --> 27:05.375
Congratulations.

27:05.709 --> 27:09.463
I saw that hole in one on a par four.
That must be a record.

27:09.630 --> 27:11.632
I got a hockey record.

27:11.965 --> 27:15.719
I tried to stab someone with my skate.
Nobody else ever did that.

27:16.303 --> 27:17.471
That's wonderful.

27:17.804 --> 27:20.724
I am a bit bummed.
I thought we got money for this.

27:21.016 --> 27:26.021
Cheer up. Next week in Portland,
the winner takes home $216,000.

27:26.730 --> 27:28.315
And the guy
who comes in last?

27:29.066 --> 27:30.317
$2,400.

27:30.609 --> 27:33.320
So no matter what,
I'll get some money.

27:36.865 --> 27:40.327
Yeah. Well, I'll see you
next week then.

27:40.828 --> 27:42.162
Bye.

27:44.998 --> 27:48.335
I hate to admit this,
but this is my first trophy.

27:48.752 --> 27:51.171
I wish that goofy golf guy
wasn't on top.

27:51.255 --> 27:53.674
Maybe I'll put a hockey guy
on instead.

27:53.841 --> 27:55.759
Happy, shut your trap.

27:56.260 --> 27:58.554
- You were great out there today.
- Thank you.

27:58.762 --> 28:01.682
But not that great.
A lot of that was luck.

28:02.015 --> 28:04.810
Some might call it luck.
I like to call it...

28:05.018 --> 28:07.020
...well, luck, I guess.
So what?

28:07.312 --> 28:09.189
Don't join the Pro Tour yet.

28:09.690 --> 28:12.442
We got work to do
before you go against professionals.

28:12.609 --> 28:15.362
Forget it.
I'll pick up the rest as I go.

28:15.529 --> 28:19.533
Don't be a fool! People would kill
to hit the long ball like you.

28:19.825 --> 28:22.536
You got an advantage
over any other golfer.

28:22.870 --> 28:25.122
By developing the rest
of your game...

28:25.455 --> 28:27.040
...you'd be unstoppable.

28:27.457 --> 28:29.710
You're right,
but I need money.

28:30.043 --> 28:34.715
Don't be an asshole. Give me six
months. I'll work with you every day.

28:35.465 --> 28:40.262
No, I got to go. I appreciate
everything. Wish me luck.

28:44.433 --> 28:46.643
Best of luck, kid.
Best of luck.

28:46.935 --> 28:49.980
Marty, shut up
and I'll tell you.

28:50.272 --> 28:52.774
The price is $200 per quilt.

28:52.983 --> 28:55.694
Well, this is handmade
quality shit.

28:56.111 --> 28:58.822
When do you need them by?
Okay.

28:59.156 --> 29:00.824
Good doing business
with you.

29:00.991 --> 29:04.328
Okay, everyone. Turn up your volumes.
Announcement.

29:04.661 --> 29:07.789
Good news... arts and crafts time
is extended 4 hours.

29:07.998 --> 29:09.666
My fingers hurt.

29:10.083 --> 29:11.335
What's that?

29:12.169 --> 29:13.754
My fingers hurt.

29:15.839 --> 29:20.010
Well, soon your back will hurt
because you just got landscaping duty.

29:20.511 --> 29:22.095
Anyone else's fingers hurt?

29:24.056 --> 29:25.432
I didn't think so.

29:27.518 --> 29:30.103
Why do you make me act
like that, huh?

29:30.521 --> 29:33.440
Mr. Gilmore!
Toidy's to the right, dear.

29:33.774 --> 29:36.693
- How's Grandma?
- Super. It's arts and crafts time.

29:36.860 --> 29:38.654
Grandma is quite a quilter.

29:39.780 --> 29:41.698
That's a tremendous trophy.

29:41.990 --> 29:44.493
Happy, I'm so glad to see you.

29:44.701 --> 29:46.286
I'm glad to see you, too.

29:46.453 --> 29:48.789
I think about you all the time.

29:49.206 --> 29:51.792
Looks like everyone's
having fun here.

29:56.797 --> 30:00.133
Good news... I made
the Professional Golfers' Tour.

30:00.467 --> 30:01.593
That's lovely.

30:01.802 --> 30:04.304
You know what else is lovely?

30:04.721 --> 30:08.809
If I can beat those other guys...
we'll get the house back.

30:09.226 --> 30:13.397
Oh, thank God! I can't stand to live
in this place another minute!

30:13.689 --> 30:15.482
I thought you liked it here.

30:15.899 --> 30:18.485
That orderly is nice.
Don't you like him?

30:18.902 --> 30:20.153
Oh, I do.

30:20.487 --> 30:24.950
It's just that the air conditioner's
broken. I'm getting a little warm.

30:25.159 --> 30:27.327
Let the kid fix it for you.

30:27.870 --> 30:30.372
Get the little twisty knobs.

30:31.832 --> 30:34.334
That ain't doing it. Okay.

30:37.880 --> 30:39.673
Mister! Mister!

30:40.090 --> 30:42.342
Get this off of me! Mister!

30:42.676 --> 30:44.261
I'll be right down!

30:44.845 --> 30:49.016
You know that "Mister, mister" lady?
I think I killed her.

31:01.778 --> 31:05.699
Norman spends more time in the sand
than David Hasselhoff.

31:06.950 --> 31:08.327
Come on, that was funny.

31:08.535 --> 31:11.246
- It was the first time I heard it.
- Drink up.

31:11.538 --> 31:16.043
Anyone tapped the keg yet?
I'll pump. I'm Happy Gilmore.

31:16.376 --> 31:18.462
Mark Lye.
Welcome to the Tour.

31:18.754 --> 31:22.216
I heard about the ace you had
on a par four. Impressive.

31:22.382 --> 31:24.051
You heard about that?

31:24.384 --> 31:26.803
Cool. That's a nice jacket.

31:27.095 --> 31:29.890
You get one if you win
the Tour Championship.

31:30.224 --> 31:32.226
Oh, yeah? What's that?

31:32.518 --> 31:34.728
Only the biggest tournament
of the year.

31:35.020 --> 31:37.731
Oh, really? Where's yours?

31:37.940 --> 31:41.818
Good one. He's funny.
I'll have mine in three months.

31:42.110 --> 31:43.779
Not if I have anything
to do with it.

31:44.071 --> 31:46.073
Whoa, look out.

31:46.573 --> 31:47.950
You better look out.

31:48.242 --> 31:51.411
If you're free, join us at 9:00
on the ninth green.

31:51.703 --> 31:54.498
- What happens there?
- Secret of the pros.

31:54.832 --> 31:56.291
All right, cool.

31:56.583 --> 32:01.588
I'm out of here. I hear the Asteroids
machine calling my name. Peace.

32:02.130 --> 32:04.633
And, Happy... dress nice, huh?

32:04.925 --> 32:06.593
All right, all right.

32:16.937 --> 32:18.814
Almost nine o'clock.

32:41.211 --> 32:44.047
Public relations lady,
you seen Shooter McGavin?

32:44.381 --> 32:46.967
- No. Why?
- I need to beat the piss out of him.

32:47.301 --> 32:50.387
Let me guess... the ninth green
at nine trick.

32:50.721 --> 32:52.306
It would appear so.

32:52.598 --> 32:54.141
He does deserve a beating.

32:54.474 --> 32:58.437
But if you beat him up,
I'll have to explain to the papers...

32:58.645 --> 33:02.816
...why the new guy beat up
Shooter McGavin. More work for me.

33:03.150 --> 33:04.484
I don't want to do that.

33:04.818 --> 33:07.905
Forget about Shooter.
He's just threatened by you.

33:08.238 --> 33:10.532
He's afraid you'll steal
his thunder.

33:10.824 --> 33:12.743
That's nice of you to say.

33:14.912 --> 33:18.165
So, I'm going to go change now.

33:19.917 --> 33:23.587
My girlfriend's dead. She fell off
a cliff and died on impact.

33:23.879 --> 33:26.089
Really?
I'm sorry to hear that.

33:28.342 --> 33:32.429
You should get some sleep.
Tomorrow's a big day.

33:32.846 --> 33:34.515
You're right. It is.

33:46.193 --> 33:48.904
Hello. I'm Verne Lundquist,
with Jack Beard.

33:49.112 --> 33:53.200
We have a nice crowd here
on this sun-sational April morning...

33:53.367 --> 33:56.119
...for the 22nd annual
AT&T Invitational.

33:56.411 --> 33:59.540
Here today are elite golfers
from around the world.

33:59.873 --> 34:04.044
The favorite is Shooter McGavin.
He's won three of the last four.

34:07.881 --> 34:09.550
Thanks, man.

34:10.384 --> 34:11.718
Here's my last buck.

34:12.052 --> 34:13.637
This is the last time.

34:13.929 --> 34:17.808
He's just trying to make some money.
Leave him alone.

34:19.768 --> 34:21.728
I don't know why I'm winning.

34:22.062 --> 34:25.190
I'm in the zone.
The hole seems to get bigger.

34:25.399 --> 34:26.859
You like being the favorite?

34:27.067 --> 34:30.487
I'm not. With the great players here,
anyone could win.

34:30.821 --> 34:32.281
I'll just do my best.

34:32.489 --> 34:36.326
The real favorite is Portland. Every
time I visit, it's harder to leave.

34:36.660 --> 34:39.580
Must be something in the water.
Well, time to play golf.

34:39.913 --> 34:41.165
Good luck.

34:42.082 --> 34:44.918
I'm a hockey player
playing golf today.

34:45.085 --> 34:46.170
Name?

34:46.336 --> 34:47.504
Happy Gilmore.

34:47.921 --> 34:49.590
The guy with the long drive.

34:49.923 --> 34:52.843
- Caddy's name?
- You haven't given me one yet.

34:53.135 --> 34:55.429
On the Pro Tour,
you provide your own.

34:55.929 --> 34:57.306
Really?

34:59.183 --> 35:00.350
Okay.

35:02.519 --> 35:05.355
Easy with those clubs.
They're antiques.

35:07.608 --> 35:10.444
Gary Potter. Great to have you
on the Tour.

35:10.777 --> 35:15.240
I feel a lot of solid energy coming
out of you. Good positive aura.

35:15.449 --> 35:17.117
Nice to meet you.

35:17.534 --> 35:20.787
Is it always like this... TV cameras,
people and stuff?

35:21.079 --> 35:23.582
Yeah, a lot of pressure.
Rise above it.

35:23.790 --> 35:26.710
Harness in the good energy,
block out the bad.

35:27.044 --> 35:29.129
Harness energy, block bad.

35:29.546 --> 35:32.132
Feel the flow, Happy.
It's circular.

35:32.549 --> 35:34.009
It's like a carousel.

35:34.301 --> 35:37.221
You get on the horse.
It goes up, down and around.

35:37.554 --> 35:41.600
Circular. Circle. With the music,
the flow. All good things.

35:42.142 --> 35:45.395
Okay. Well, great. Thanks.
Nice to meet you.

35:46.230 --> 35:47.481
Psycho.

35:47.981 --> 35:50.400
Next to tee off,
Happy Gilmore.

35:52.027 --> 35:53.737
Give me a club.

35:55.489 --> 35:56.824
I'll get it.

36:08.836 --> 36:12.381
Fu..., sh..., fu..., ass...

36:21.765 --> 36:22.933
Sorry.

36:27.938 --> 36:28.856
Psycho.

36:45.205 --> 36:47.958
What a shot
by Happy Gilmore!

36:48.250 --> 36:50.043
Who the hell is
Happy Gilmore?

37:12.649 --> 37:14.109
Oh, yeah!

37:15.986 --> 37:17.154
I got it!

37:18.989 --> 37:19.948
Like that, baby?

37:20.240 --> 37:22.868
Plenty more
where that came from!

37:24.953 --> 37:27.247
Get Virginia Venit in here, now.

37:27.456 --> 37:28.999
Use a five iron.

37:29.249 --> 37:31.627
You think so?
Give me my wedge.

37:45.516 --> 37:48.810
Five iron, huh?
You're fired. Bye-bye.

38:03.325 --> 38:07.913
What are you doing, Happy... riding
a bull? You're acting like a damn fool!

38:14.086 --> 38:17.714
Doing the bull dance.
Feeling the flow. Working it.

38:18.006 --> 38:21.134
On the 18th green, Shooter McGavin
putts for the win.

38:21.468 --> 38:25.722
His crowd seems unusually small
for this type of moment.

38:31.395 --> 38:34.189
Most people are over watching
Happy Gilmore.

38:34.481 --> 38:36.149
He's the talk of the course...

38:36.400 --> 38:39.820
...with his huge drives
and bizarre behavior.

38:40.028 --> 38:44.408
He's on the 17th green right now,
having trouble closing out his day.

38:44.741 --> 38:49.204
Happy, the ball has its own energy
or life force, if you will.

38:49.621 --> 38:52.541
Its natural environment
is in the hole.

38:52.833 --> 38:54.501
Why don't you send him home?

38:55.252 --> 38:58.088
His bags are packed.
He has his plane ticket.

38:58.380 --> 39:00.048
Bring him to the airport.

39:00.674 --> 39:01.800
Send him home.

39:03.260 --> 39:05.762
Send him home.
I'll send him home.

39:06.096 --> 39:08.599
It's time to go home, ball.

39:12.686 --> 39:15.689
Son of a bitch ball!
Why didn't you go home?!

39:15.898 --> 39:20.068
That's your home! Are you too good
for your home?! Answer me!

39:20.486 --> 39:22.905
Suck my white ass, ball!

39:29.161 --> 39:33.081
Draft a press release stating Gilmore
is being thrown off the Tour.

39:33.415 --> 39:34.958
I want to see it by 6:00 P.M.

39:35.292 --> 39:39.463
You're right... his behavior is
completely unacceptable.

39:39.796 --> 39:43.133
But golf has been waiting
for a player like this.

39:43.425 --> 39:46.136
A colorful, emotional,
working class hero.

39:46.345 --> 39:49.556
I will not tolerate this behavior.
Gilmore is gone.

39:49.765 --> 39:51.642
I got a call
from the Dallas Open.

39:51.850 --> 39:55.521
They're deluged with calls
from people who want to see Happy.

39:55.812 --> 39:57.814
- They sold out.
- Already?

39:58.106 --> 40:01.360
I know he's a little rough.
Let me work with him.

40:03.654 --> 40:07.074
Okay. Fine.
But he's your responsibility.

40:07.491 --> 40:09.493
If he cleans up, he can stay.

40:09.701 --> 40:11.995
If he doesn't, it's your ass.

40:12.329 --> 40:13.997
And any more of this...

40:17.501 --> 40:18.961
...and he's gone.

40:27.010 --> 40:28.345
Shooter! Shooter!

40:28.595 --> 40:30.764
What do you think
of Happy Gilmore?

40:30.973 --> 40:34.184
I didn't see him play.
I was too busy winning.

40:34.518 --> 40:36.687
But a 450-yard drive
is impressive.

40:36.937 --> 40:41.275
Yeah. Where did he finish again?
Dead last? Yeah, he had a good day.

40:41.692 --> 40:43.277
Did he really make
a 450-yard ace?

40:43.485 --> 40:44.862
Where's my check?

40:45.154 --> 40:46.405
We mail them next week.

40:46.697 --> 40:47.948
I want mine now.

40:48.282 --> 40:49.616
I don't have any checks.

40:49.867 --> 40:53.370
He got one. Give me
one of them big ones, I don't care.

40:55.581 --> 40:56.832
Give me a beer, pal.

40:57.249 --> 40:58.500
Put that on my tab.

40:58.834 --> 41:01.628
You were the talk
of the tournament, Gilmore.

41:01.837 --> 41:03.380
Wow, thanks a lot.

41:03.714 --> 41:07.968
You sure crush the ball at the tee.
You'd do well in a long-drive contest.

41:08.302 --> 41:12.055
You'd make good money, traveling,
hustling at driving ranges.

41:12.264 --> 41:14.975
I know what you're doing
right now...

41:15.184 --> 41:20.189
...and I don't like it. So just shut
your trap before I put my foot in it.

41:22.566 --> 41:26.570
Don't turn your back on me.
Listen, this is Shooter's tour.

41:26.862 --> 41:30.115
I worked hard, paid my dues...
now it's Shooter's turn.

41:30.324 --> 41:34.578
Shooter won't let his reign at the top
be spoiled by some freak.

41:34.912 --> 41:36.371
Did you call me a freak?

41:36.872 --> 41:39.500
I was on this tour for one reason...
money.

41:39.583 --> 41:41.877
Now I got a new one...
kicking your ass.

41:42.294 --> 41:44.713
I'd like to see you try.

41:45.756 --> 41:46.798
Let's do it.

41:47.925 --> 41:49.259
I meant at golf.

41:49.510 --> 41:51.178
What's going on here?

41:51.470 --> 41:54.181
I was looking for the other half
of this bottle.

41:54.389 --> 41:57.226
Oh, there's some of it
right there.

41:57.518 --> 41:59.811
- Why don't you put it down?
- I know.

42:00.938 --> 42:04.942
Just stay out of my way.
Or you'll pay. Listen to what I say.

42:05.442 --> 42:07.402
Why don't I go eat some hay?

42:07.736 --> 42:10.948
I could make things out of clay
and lay by the bay.

42:11.281 --> 42:12.741
What do you say?

42:17.621 --> 42:20.249
Calm down or you'll get kicked
off the Tour.

42:20.666 --> 42:23.585
- That can't happen.
- It can, and I don't want it to.

42:24.002 --> 42:25.462
You could be a big star.

42:25.671 --> 42:27.631
I just want to make
some money.

42:27.965 --> 42:31.301
You won't be around long enough
to do that if you don't behave.

42:31.510 --> 42:33.387
What do you mean by "behave"?

42:33.595 --> 42:35.973
No swearing,
no throwing clubs...

42:36.223 --> 42:38.934
...and especially no hitting
other players.

42:39.142 --> 42:41.019
You mean no fun.

42:41.228 --> 42:42.771
You can have fun.

42:43.105 --> 42:47.651
That's why I think people come
to see you. But keep it within reason.

42:48.819 --> 42:53.615
I will work on what you call behaving.
But I won't act like a stiff.

42:54.032 --> 42:56.118
Fine. Thank you.

42:57.703 --> 42:59.163
Hey, um...

42:59.663 --> 43:01.331
...you want to get some food?

43:01.623 --> 43:04.334
No, thanks.
I don't date golfers.

43:04.668 --> 43:06.545
Good. I'm a hockey player.

43:09.047 --> 43:11.341
Just behave, okay?

43:14.469 --> 43:18.640
Happy Gilmore approaches the tee
in the 72nd annual Cleveland Classic.

43:19.057 --> 43:21.977
Happy Gilmore!
Drive it 400 yards!

43:22.394 --> 43:26.023
I can't believe I have fans.
I waited all my life for that.

43:28.025 --> 43:29.693
Don't be alarmed,
Mr. Gilmore.

43:29.902 --> 43:33.155
I know we had our problems,
but I'm proud of you.

43:33.363 --> 43:35.115
Thanks a lot, Mr. Larson.

43:35.324 --> 43:37.326
It's good to see you again.

43:37.701 --> 43:40.037
How's that, uh, thing feeling?

43:40.329 --> 43:42.706
Terrific. The nail comes out
next week.

43:43.040 --> 43:45.209
Well, you hardly even notice it.

43:49.379 --> 43:51.173
Let's make a little noise here.

43:53.550 --> 43:55.844
Come on!
I can't hear you!

44:22.454 --> 44:24.414
Trying to reach
the green from here?

44:24.665 --> 44:26.083
That's not possible, sir.

44:26.416 --> 44:27.376
I beg to differ.

44:27.459 --> 44:31.421
Happy Gilmore accomplished that feat
no more than an hour ago.

44:31.755 --> 44:35.592
Well, moron, good for Happy...
Oh, my God!

44:46.144 --> 44:47.187
Oh, my God.

44:54.987 --> 44:58.407
Hey, Shooter,
you forgot your nine iron.

45:02.703 --> 45:07.207
A large and economically diverse crowd
here at the Michelob Invitational.

45:07.499 --> 45:10.127
It's the tour sensation,
Happy Gilmore...

45:10.419 --> 45:15.215
...who's attracting all types
to this course. I even saw one guy...

45:15.424 --> 45:18.886
...wearing one of those
beer-dispensing helmets.

45:27.853 --> 45:30.731
Damn you people.
Go back to your shanties.

45:31.690 --> 45:35.319
This is a biggie, pal.
I got to make some real money.

45:35.569 --> 45:37.946
What do you think?
Slightly downhill?

45:38.238 --> 45:39.406
And slanting left.

45:39.615 --> 45:42.743
No, you think that
'cause you only got one shoe on.

45:44.495 --> 45:45.662
Oh, yeah.

46:00.052 --> 46:01.178
Happy Gilmore

46:32.167 --> 46:33.293
You got the ball?

46:42.886 --> 46:44.680
Happy Gilmore from nine feet.

46:45.097 --> 46:46.890
Here comes the putter throw.

46:47.182 --> 46:52.062
Wait. He's restrained himself.
Maybe this is a new Happy Gilmore.

46:56.358 --> 46:59.820
Another tournament here in Dallas,
and Shooter McGavin wins again.

47:00.112 --> 47:02.406
He's won here 3 years in a row.

47:15.752 --> 47:17.504
That son of a bitch!

47:17.921 --> 47:22.092
Give me my ball! Give it here!
Cough it up, you dirty bastard!

47:22.426 --> 47:23.760
I'll rip it out of you!

47:24.011 --> 47:25.012
Give me...

47:25.762 --> 47:27.097
Give me the ball.

47:32.227 --> 47:33.770
You have one eye.

47:35.439 --> 47:36.690
Chubbs.

47:37.441 --> 47:38.609
You took his hand.

48:21.318 --> 48:24.655
That Happy Gilmore is a real crack-up.
He's a hoot!

48:24.905 --> 48:27.908
He's bringing in
some big crowds.

48:28.242 --> 48:32.287
Today, one of his fans mooned me.
He had "HAPPY" written on his ass.

48:32.579 --> 48:35.916
"HA" was on one cheek
and "PPY" on the other.

48:36.250 --> 48:38.001
I love what he's doing for golf.

48:38.252 --> 48:42.089
- Well, I'm starting to come around.
- Everyone is.

48:42.297 --> 48:43.841
Well, I'm not, Doug!!

48:44.091 --> 48:45.759
This man is destroying golf.

48:46.051 --> 48:49.179
I saw two fat bikers in the woods
off 17 having sex.

48:49.388 --> 48:51.348
How can I chip
with that going on?

48:51.682 --> 48:55.644
- Kick him off the Tour.
- He hasn't broken any rules.

48:56.061 --> 48:57.437
He's a disgrace to the game!

48:57.729 --> 49:02.317
Yes, but our ratings are up.
We're attracting new, youthful sponsors.

49:02.860 --> 49:04.278
I'm sorry, Shooter.

49:04.611 --> 49:06.071
There's nothing I can do.

49:09.825 --> 49:12.619
Then I'll have to take care of this
myself.

49:13.579 --> 49:17.207
Grandma, I came in 9th place.
I won $35,000.

49:17.457 --> 49:19.126
So we'll get the house back?

49:19.418 --> 49:22.045
As long as I don't place last
the next two times...

49:22.337 --> 49:23.797
...we'll get the money in time.

49:24.006 --> 49:25.966
That's wonderful, Happy.

49:26.300 --> 49:27.885
I love you, Grandma. Bye.

49:28.177 --> 49:29.720
Good-bye, darling.

49:34.558 --> 49:38.187
We should go on that date.
I've been pretty good lately.

49:38.478 --> 49:41.815
Oh? I hear you broke a rake
and threw it in the woods.

49:42.065 --> 49:45.694
I didn't break it.
I was testing its durability.

49:45.986 --> 49:48.906
I put it in the woods
because it's made of wood...

49:49.031 --> 49:50.991
...and he should be
with his family.

49:52.493 --> 49:54.328
At least I didn't punch anyone.

49:55.412 --> 49:59.249
Okay, we'll go on a date.
But just as friends.

49:59.750 --> 50:02.669
Slow down. I don't want to be
more than friends.

50:03.003 --> 50:04.671
I just met you.

50:08.759 --> 50:10.093
Fit you okay?

50:10.427 --> 50:13.347
I haven't skated
since I was a little kid.

50:15.599 --> 50:18.435
Can we get a little time here?

50:19.603 --> 50:22.606
For Happy Gilmore, anything.

50:25.943 --> 50:27.611
You played ice hockey?

50:27.945 --> 50:29.071
Shut up.

50:31.156 --> 50:32.950
Oh, my God... power failure.

50:33.450 --> 50:35.452
It's very scary in here.

50:35.619 --> 50:36.787
Did you plan this?

50:37.120 --> 50:38.372
No.

50:42.709 --> 50:45.546
I thought we were going to be
just friends.

50:46.171 --> 50:49.633
What? Friends listen to "Endless Love"
in the dark.

51:03.689 --> 51:07.568
This song reminds me
of seventh grade.

51:07.734 --> 51:10.237
It reminds me
of my grandmother.

51:10.571 --> 51:11.822
That's kind of weird.

51:12.156 --> 51:14.241
She took me to see this movie.

51:14.324 --> 51:17.035
I had the biggest crush
on Brooke Shields.

51:18.162 --> 51:22.166
My grandma told me I should
write her a letter, so I did.

51:22.583 --> 51:25.502
I got a letter back
from Brooke two weeks later.

51:25.669 --> 51:28.422
But it was in my grandmother's
handwriting.

51:29.256 --> 51:30.924
Your grandma sounds sweet.

51:31.216 --> 51:34.845
She is sweet.
That's why I feel so terrible.

51:35.179 --> 51:36.346
Why?

51:37.681 --> 51:39.683
No, forget it.

51:40.601 --> 51:42.686
You can tell me.

51:43.520 --> 51:47.900
She's stuck in a nursing home.
The IRS repossessed her house.

51:48.525 --> 51:49.776
That's awful.

51:50.110 --> 51:51.528
That's why I joined the Tour.

51:51.862 --> 51:54.281
I'm close to getting
her house back.

51:54.448 --> 51:57.284
Don't tell anyone.
I'm kind of embarrassed.

51:58.744 --> 52:01.121
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone.

52:03.457 --> 52:04.875
I'll make you a bet.

52:05.959 --> 52:07.628
Do you always carry a puck?

52:07.794 --> 52:08.879
Yeah.

52:10.422 --> 52:14.384
Now, if you get that puck
in the net over there...

52:14.801 --> 52:17.721
...I’ll never bother you again.

52:18.222 --> 52:20.974
But if you miss...

52:21.808 --> 52:24.603
...you have to give me
a big, fat kiss.

52:25.020 --> 52:26.563
And you have to pretend
you like it.

52:27.105 --> 52:28.232
Really?

52:28.774 --> 52:29.817
Good luck.

52:43.163 --> 52:44.414
Shit.

52:45.249 --> 52:47.668
Talk about your all-time backfires.

52:49.086 --> 52:50.170
Happy...

52:53.799 --> 52:55.467
...I didn't see it go in.

53:08.272 --> 53:11.942
I'll give it all to you

53:13.610 --> 53:16.613
My love, my love, my love

53:17.364 --> 53:19.950
My endless love

53:37.718 --> 53:39.887
Welcome to soggy San Francisco...

53:40.220 --> 53:42.472
...site of this year's Pepsi Pro-Am.

53:43.015 --> 53:45.392
Hello, Happy.
I'm Bob Barker.

53:45.726 --> 53:47.728
What an honor.
Nice to meet you.

53:48.020 --> 53:50.230
We're playing together today.

53:51.148 --> 53:53.734
That's funny.
Who am I really playing with?

53:53.984 --> 53:56.778
In a Pro-Am, each golfer plays
with a celebrity.

53:56.987 --> 53:57.905
Wow.

53:58.155 --> 54:02.409
Nick Faldo and I won last year.
I'd like to win this year.

54:02.618 --> 54:04.495
I'll do my best.

54:05.120 --> 54:06.580
Hey, Gilmore?

54:06.914 --> 54:09.416
You suck, you jackass.

54:09.708 --> 54:11.168
Shut the hell up.

54:13.462 --> 54:17.216
I'd love to punch that guy in the face,
but I'd get in trouble.

54:17.508 --> 54:19.510
You get this
on "Let's Make A Deal"?

54:19.718 --> 54:21.178
"The Price Is Right", Happy.

54:22.012 --> 54:22.930
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

54:23.263 --> 54:25.682
It happens.
Let's play some golf.

54:31.104 --> 54:32.439
Jackass.

54:36.401 --> 54:38.070
The club went further
than the ball.

54:39.863 --> 54:41.406
What was that all about?

54:41.698 --> 54:46.703
It's just that it's rainy
and that guy... It just slipped.

54:53.627 --> 54:58.298
Get a blanket and suntan lotion,
'cause you'll never get off that beach.

54:58.799 --> 55:02.970
Just the way you never got
into the NHL, you jackass!

55:09.643 --> 55:11.436
The green's that way.

55:19.069 --> 55:22.072
You will not make this putt,
you jackass.

55:27.828 --> 55:29.371
Nice shooting, soldier.

55:33.834 --> 55:35.836
All right, Happy...

55:36.336 --> 55:38.338
...nice and easy.

55:43.552 --> 55:45.846
That was not nice and easy.

55:50.642 --> 55:52.436
That guy is driving me crazy.

55:52.728 --> 55:56.482
What's driving me crazy is
you not getting the ball in the hole.

55:56.899 --> 55:59.693
Don't push me, Bob.
Now's not the time.

56:04.531 --> 56:05.866
Jackass.

56:10.662 --> 56:12.539
This guy sucks!

56:13.582 --> 56:17.753
We haven't seen Gilmore play this badly
since his first day on tour.

56:18.045 --> 56:21.089
He and Bob Barker
are now dead last.

56:21.381 --> 56:25.552
You should be working at the snack bar,
not playing golf.

56:25.802 --> 56:27.137
Relax, Bob.

56:27.346 --> 56:31.808
There is no way you could have been
as bad at hockey as you are at golf.

56:32.226 --> 56:33.894
Okay, let's go.

56:35.270 --> 56:38.190
You like that, old man?!
You want a piece of me?

56:39.024 --> 56:42.152
I don't want a piece of you.
I want the whole thing!

56:57.376 --> 56:59.670
Now you're gonna get it,
Bobby!

57:19.898 --> 57:21.984
The price is wrong, bitch.

57:33.245 --> 57:34.788
I think you've had enough.

57:35.956 --> 57:36.874
No?

57:39.918 --> 57:41.587
Now you've had enough.

57:42.421 --> 57:43.797
Bitch.

57:46.592 --> 57:48.260
That couldn't have gone better.

57:48.385 --> 57:51.054
Instead of hitting you,
he hits Bob Barker.

57:51.305 --> 57:52.306
Perfect.

57:52.556 --> 57:54.641
So, see you
at the next tournament?

57:54.933 --> 57:58.896
No need. This was on national TV.
Gilmore is gone.

57:59.104 --> 58:02.983
Let's get something at the Red Lobster.
My treat.

58:03.275 --> 58:04.526
Some other time.

58:04.818 --> 58:06.612
I thought we were friends.

58:07.029 --> 58:09.323
We are. I just have to go.

58:09.656 --> 58:13.494
I'll be at the Red Lobster
in case you change your mind.

58:13.827 --> 58:15.245
God bless!

58:15.913 --> 58:17.247
There you are.

58:17.581 --> 58:19.833
Happy Gilmore,
come on down!

58:20.167 --> 58:22.252
Thank you, Shooter.
Sit down.

58:23.003 --> 58:26.840
So you got in a fight with a game show
host on national TV.

58:27.049 --> 58:28.717
That is not entertainment.

58:29.009 --> 58:32.262
This is not hockey,
no matter how much you want it to be.

58:32.471 --> 58:34.681
I know that and I'm sorry.

58:34.973 --> 58:36.934
But there was a guy out there...

58:37.267 --> 58:40.395
...giving me crap. It took all I had
not to hit him.

58:40.687 --> 58:44.358
So you head-butt Bob Barker?
Who won that fight, anyway?

58:44.691 --> 58:45.692
Enough, Shooter.

58:45.943 --> 58:48.111
The board has done the following:

58:48.320 --> 58:51.114
Fined you $25,000
and suspended you for one month.

58:51.448 --> 58:54.451
- What?! I got to play!
- What?! Kick him off the Tour.

58:54.993 --> 58:57.788
The board thinks
that might be extreme...

58:58.121 --> 59:01.458
...considering the fact
that our ratings were...

59:01.959 --> 59:03.627
...the highest we've ever had.

59:03.877 --> 59:06.547
My grandmother's house
got repossessed.

59:06.880 --> 59:10.717
If I don't win more prize money,
they'll sell it to someone else.

59:11.051 --> 59:13.345
Whoop-dee-doo.
Get out.

59:18.767 --> 59:23.230
It's over. My grandmother
will never see her house again.

59:23.480 --> 59:27.818
But you've made a lot of money.
You could buy her a nice condo.

59:27.943 --> 59:31.822
My grandfather didn't build
any condos with his bare hands.

59:32.239 --> 59:34.616
Damn it,
I hate that Bob Barker.

59:34.908 --> 59:38.078
There must be
another way to get the $50,000.

59:38.370 --> 59:42.124
I don't want to talk about it.
I failed, okay?

59:42.416 --> 59:45.878
Let me just enjoy the one thing
that makes me a bit happy...

59:46.170 --> 59:48.797
...this fresh, delicious, tasty...

59:49.089 --> 59:51.300
...meaty, turkey-filled...

59:51.592 --> 59:56.430
...Cold Cut Combo. I eat three
every day just to keep me strong.

59:56.722 --> 59:57.973
Hey, Happy...

59:58.265 --> 59:59.933
...can I have one of those?

1:00:00.267 --> 1:00:01.935
Coming right up!

1:00:07.441 --> 1:00:09.776
Talk about a hole in one.

1:00:10.068 --> 1:00:13.280
Subway sandwiches
will drive away your hunger.

1:00:14.364 --> 1:00:15.365
What do you think?

1:00:15.491 --> 1:00:18.827
I love it. He looks so handsome.
And it makes me hungry.

1:00:19.119 --> 1:00:22.789
They gave me a card
that gives us free Subway for life.

1:00:22.998 --> 1:00:24.124
That's lovely.

1:00:24.458 --> 1:00:26.460
You know what else is lovely?

1:00:26.752 --> 1:00:29.963
That commercial puts us up
to $275,000.

1:00:30.297 --> 1:00:32.466
Let's go get your house back.

1:00:42.184 --> 1:00:43.852
What the hell?

1:00:49.066 --> 1:00:50.400
What's going on here?

1:00:50.651 --> 1:00:54.488
It's exciting. We're auctioning off
your grandmother's house.

1:00:54.696 --> 1:00:58.033
You said if we got the money,
we could buy it back.

1:00:58.325 --> 1:00:59.576
You can buy it back.

1:01:00.327 --> 1:01:02.913
Bidding will start at $100,000.
Do I hear 100?

1:01:03.163 --> 1:01:05.415
This is the exciting part.
Have fun.

1:01:06.792 --> 1:01:10.420
Look at all these people.
What's going on, Happy?

1:01:10.838 --> 1:01:12.089
Thank you, two.

1:01:12.506 --> 1:01:14.174
They're auctioning it off.

1:01:14.424 --> 1:01:17.219
Good. We'll get it cheaper
than we thought.

1:01:17.511 --> 1:01:19.513
Two fifty, thank you.

1:01:20.138 --> 1:01:22.349
Maybe not. Two seventy-five!

1:01:22.641 --> 1:01:24.852
Two seventy-five. And three.

1:01:25.144 --> 1:01:26.520
Three fifty down front.

1:01:26.812 --> 1:01:30.149
I have three fifty.
Seventy-five anywhere?

1:01:30.566 --> 1:01:34.027
Three fifty... sold to the gentleman
in the white sweater.

1:01:34.319 --> 1:01:35.863
What just happened, Happy?

1:01:37.656 --> 1:01:39.449
Go wait in the car, Grandma.

1:01:41.285 --> 1:01:43.370
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1:01:43.620 --> 1:01:45.706
I enjoy real estate speculation.

1:01:47.124 --> 1:01:51.128
You touch me, I burn the house down
and piss on the ashes.

1:01:51.420 --> 1:01:52.963
What do you want for it?

1:01:53.630 --> 1:01:54.631
You know what.

1:01:55.048 --> 1:01:57.050
You off the Tour.

1:01:57.259 --> 1:01:59.761
Quit, and the house is yours.

1:02:00.053 --> 1:02:01.138
Fine. I quit.

1:02:01.430 --> 1:02:03.390
No way. Happy, come here.

1:02:03.640 --> 1:02:07.478
He's right. I don't belong in golf.
I'm a hockey player.

1:02:07.686 --> 1:02:10.063
- What team do you play for?
- Easy.

1:02:10.397 --> 1:02:13.317
Face it, Happy.
You are a golfer.

1:02:14.151 --> 1:02:18.655
I did this to get Grandma's house back.
Now I can. No regrets.

1:02:19.072 --> 1:02:24.077
What do you think she wants more... to
get her house back or see you succeed?

1:02:26.246 --> 1:02:29.917
Maybe she can have both.
Hey, Shooter.

1:02:30.626 --> 1:02:32.836
The Tour Championship
is next week.

1:02:33.545 --> 1:02:37.174
If I beat you, I get the house.
You beat me, I'll quit.

1:02:37.508 --> 1:02:40.427
You're going to beat me?
At golf?

1:02:42.513 --> 1:02:43.847
You're on.

1:02:44.389 --> 1:02:48.018
But you're in trouble. I eat pieces
of shit like you for breakfast.

1:02:48.268 --> 1:02:50.521
You eat pieces of shit
for breakfast?

1:02:52.439 --> 1:02:53.565
No.

1:02:58.445 --> 1:03:01.615
That was great.
I know you will kick his ass.

1:03:01.907 --> 1:03:03.575
That makes one of us.

1:03:03.867 --> 1:03:06.620
Take care of Grandma.
I'll walk from here.

1:03:06.912 --> 1:03:09.957
- Where are you going?
- To learn to play golf.

1:03:12.626 --> 1:03:15.128
I'm stupid, you're smart.

1:03:15.671 --> 1:03:17.756
I was wrong,
you were right.

1:03:18.298 --> 1:03:20.801
You're the best,
I'm the worst.

1:03:21.093 --> 1:03:24.972
You're very good-looking,
I'm not attractive.

1:03:25.264 --> 1:03:28.892
Okay, as long as you're willing
to admit that. Now...

1:03:29.143 --> 1:03:32.980
...are you ready to work
and do what I tell you?

1:03:33.313 --> 1:03:34.857
Believe me, I'm ready.

1:03:35.983 --> 1:03:37.651
Then let's get to work.

1:03:39.570 --> 1:03:42.072
I'm sorry. Here.

1:03:43.198 --> 1:03:44.658
Here's your pinky.

1:03:52.374 --> 1:03:54.168
"Happyland", just like me.

1:03:54.459 --> 1:03:56.753
Don't get excited.
I've been here before.

1:03:59.339 --> 1:04:03.510
This is embarrassing. I'm a
professional golfer, for God's sake.

1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:07.598
No, it's your short game
that's embarrassing. Let's go.

1:04:22.821 --> 1:04:26.158
Just line up the putt.
Don't even look at the hole.

1:04:26.575 --> 1:04:31.038
Aim for a spot six inches
in front of the hole. Line up with that.

1:04:31.371 --> 1:04:33.373
Okay. Six inches.

1:04:56.396 --> 1:04:58.398
This one's very tough.

1:05:03.278 --> 1:05:05.072
He's laughing, having fun.

1:05:05.364 --> 1:05:07.658
Yeah, laugh it up.
Enjoy your night.

1:05:08.575 --> 1:05:10.369
Happy, concentrate.

1:05:17.459 --> 1:05:19.002
I hate that clown.

1:05:19.336 --> 1:05:24.007
Easy. If you can't beat the clown,
how will you beat Shooter McGavin?

1:05:32.474 --> 1:05:34.143
You're gonna die, clown!

1:05:36.103 --> 1:05:39.022
Is that funny? I don't hear you
laughing now!

1:05:39.439 --> 1:05:40.607
Enough.

1:05:40.816 --> 1:05:42.359
What? I can't do it!

1:05:42.901 --> 1:05:46.113
Come with me, Happy.
Come on!

1:05:46.446 --> 1:05:48.532
You suck, you stupid clown!

1:05:50.826 --> 1:05:52.619
Remember, this isn't hockey.

1:05:52.911 --> 1:05:57.082
You don't play with raw emotion.
You can't putt angry.

1:05:57.499 --> 1:06:01.253
You must clear your mind
of everything else and stay focused.

1:06:06.133 --> 1:06:07.926
How can I do that?

1:06:08.343 --> 1:06:11.471
Think of a place
that's really perfect.

1:06:11.805 --> 1:06:13.974
Your own happy place.

1:06:14.308 --> 1:06:17.394
Go there and all your anger
will disappear.

1:06:17.811 --> 1:06:19.062
Then putt.

1:06:20.022 --> 1:06:21.273
Happy place.

1:06:21.690 --> 1:06:23.484
Happy place.

1:06:23.775 --> 1:06:25.652
Your happy place.

1:06:55.599 --> 1:06:56.600
Now how do you feel?

1:06:56.850 --> 1:06:57.851
Better.

1:06:58.519 --> 1:06:59.520
Now putt.

1:07:22.167 --> 1:07:23.544
Your happy place.

1:07:30.509 --> 1:07:33.011
We took some giant steps
tonight.

1:07:33.846 --> 1:07:35.514
I'm really proud of you.

1:07:36.056 --> 1:07:37.182
Here.

1:07:38.225 --> 1:07:40.519
I got something special
for you.

1:07:40.936 --> 1:07:41.895
Thanks, Chubbs.

1:07:42.187 --> 1:07:46.900
It's the putter I used when I played...
slightly modified, of course.

1:07:47.192 --> 1:07:49.695
Man, this is excellent.

1:07:50.946 --> 1:07:55.826
You got the spirit of a hockey player
in you, so I figured... why fight it?

1:07:56.076 --> 1:07:58.328
I got something for you, too.

1:07:58.871 --> 1:08:02.082
If not for you, none of this
would have happened...

1:08:02.332 --> 1:08:04.585
...so I wanted to show
my appreciation.

1:08:08.589 --> 1:08:10.549
This looks nice.
What is it?

1:08:10.841 --> 1:08:11.800
Open it.

1:08:12.092 --> 1:08:13.051
Shit.

1:08:13.760 --> 1:08:14.845
Oh, man.

1:08:15.137 --> 1:08:17.097
Remember the 'gator
that got your hand?

1:08:17.431 --> 1:08:19.099
I got his head.

1:08:31.612 --> 1:08:34.323
First my dad and now Chubbs.

1:08:34.615 --> 1:08:38.076
Anyone I get close to, dies.
If I were you, I'd run.

1:08:38.494 --> 1:08:40.871
You can't blame yourself
for this.

1:08:41.288 --> 1:08:44.458
I guess that alligator
finally finished the job.

1:08:44.958 --> 1:08:46.543
I'm going to miss you, pal.

1:08:55.302 --> 1:08:56.970
How am I going to play today?

1:08:57.262 --> 1:08:58.931
Just remember
what he taught you.

1:08:59.223 --> 1:09:03.227
Congratulations, murderer.
You killed a golf legend.

1:09:03.519 --> 1:09:04.561
Beat it, McGavin.

1:09:04.770 --> 1:09:09.233
I'm dedicating my performance at the
Tour Championship to Chubbs' memory.

1:09:09.650 --> 1:09:11.652
I'm playing for Chubbs.

1:09:11.860 --> 1:09:13.403
I called it first.

1:09:13.946 --> 1:09:17.157
You want to beat him?
Beat him on the course.

1:09:17.491 --> 1:09:20.202
Yeah, I'm gonna beat your ass
out there.

1:09:20.410 --> 1:09:22.579
Right. And Grizzly Adams
had a beard.

1:09:22.913 --> 1:09:24.665
Grizzly Adams did have a beard.

1:09:28.001 --> 1:09:29.795
The golfers
of the Tour Championship...

1:09:30.212 --> 1:09:33.549
...are ready to begin.
There may be 63 professionals...

1:09:33.841 --> 1:09:35.342
...vying for the title
of world's best...

1:09:35.425 --> 1:09:38.846
but in the minds of the spectators,
there are only two.

1:09:39.096 --> 1:09:41.056
Tour kingpin Shooter McGavin...

1:09:41.348 --> 1:09:44.685
...and bad boy Happy Gilmore,
just off suspension.

1:09:44.935 --> 1:09:47.938
Wouldn't you know it?
They've been paired together.

1:09:48.147 --> 1:09:51.775
I have some good interior design ideas
for Grandma's house.

1:09:52.109 --> 1:09:54.528
You know the bedroom
next to the stairs?

1:09:54.820 --> 1:09:56.071
Yeah, that was my room.

1:09:56.363 --> 1:09:58.866
I'm turning it
into my trophy room.

1:10:11.795 --> 1:10:13.463
It just may not be
big enough.

1:10:14.840 --> 1:10:15.966
All right.

1:10:30.272 --> 1:10:34.151
You know what's pathetic?
You've been playing golf all your life.

1:10:38.906 --> 1:10:41.325
Let me show you
how we do it in the pros.

1:10:48.624 --> 1:10:50.000
That's got to hurt.

1:10:58.217 --> 1:11:01.845
Happy learned how to putt.
Uh-oh.

1:11:03.847 --> 1:11:05.432
Here's a free lesson.

1:11:11.772 --> 1:11:13.774
Can't learn that
on a hockey rink.

1:11:25.244 --> 1:11:27.704
Somebody's closer.

1:11:29.790 --> 1:11:32.626
After one day,
Shooter McGavin is leading.

1:11:32.835 --> 1:11:36.046
But the big surprise
is young Happy Gilmore...

1:11:36.713 --> 1:11:40.050
...nipping at his heels,
trailing by only one stroke.

1:11:41.718 --> 1:11:42.970
Shooter from the sand.

1:11:43.262 --> 1:11:45.889
Playing like he really wants
that jacket.

1:11:51.895 --> 1:11:54.648
Happy Gilmore answers back
with a birdie.

1:12:08.412 --> 1:12:11.206
Happy with a long eagle opportunity.

1:12:13.292 --> 1:12:14.543
It's good!

1:12:15.294 --> 1:12:17.254
And Shooter can't believe it!

1:12:17.588 --> 1:12:20.591
He is now tied
with Happy Gilmore!

1:12:23.719 --> 1:12:26.763
Uh-oh. A little too much zip
on that one.

1:12:28.307 --> 1:12:31.226
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

1:12:31.643 --> 1:12:32.895
No!

1:12:36.732 --> 1:12:40.694
I didn't see that. Did it go in?
I wasn't watching.

1:12:41.111 --> 1:12:45.616
I wasn't watching. I saw it go up.
Did it go back in?

1:12:46.116 --> 1:12:49.244
At the end of day three,
Happy Gilmore has the lead.

1:12:49.578 --> 1:12:53.749
One has to be impressed with the vast
improvement in his short game.

1:13:13.352 --> 1:13:14.895
Donald, it's Shooter.

1:13:15.312 --> 1:13:17.940
Shooter!
It's great to hear from you!

1:13:18.232 --> 1:13:20.442
Want to go to Sizzler
and get some grub?

1:13:20.984 --> 1:13:22.402
No, thanks. Not hungry.

1:13:22.611 --> 1:13:27.115
This call is about business.
I need you here in the morning.

1:13:27.533 --> 1:13:29.743
It's the final day
of the Tour Championship...

1:13:29.827 --> 1:13:31.995
...and it promises to be
a classic.

1:13:32.454 --> 1:13:34.540
Happy Gilmore leads the pack.

1:13:34.832 --> 1:13:39.002
Is this a changing of the guard?
We'll know in 18 holes.

1:13:45.467 --> 1:13:48.262
Happy is really on today.

1:14:01.191 --> 1:14:02.234
There he is.

1:14:02.860 --> 1:14:04.111
That worm.

1:14:04.653 --> 1:14:06.321
Happy, look out!

1:14:12.452 --> 1:14:13.537
Are you okay?

1:14:13.704 --> 1:14:15.372
Volkswagen.

1:14:15.706 --> 1:14:17.291
Jackass!

1:14:33.223 --> 1:14:34.558
Jackass!

1:14:35.225 --> 1:14:39.188
You have no serious injuries.
Just keep off your feet for a few days.

1:14:39.480 --> 1:14:41.273
Forget it.
I have to finish.

1:14:41.565 --> 1:14:44.401
Do what you like. What do I know?
I'm just a doctor.

1:14:44.568 --> 1:14:46.028
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1:14:46.361 --> 1:14:49.490
There is no shame
in throwing in the towel.

1:14:49.698 --> 1:14:51.909
You must be careful
with your health.

1:14:52.201 --> 1:14:54.077
Let's just play some golf.

1:14:54.912 --> 1:14:56.455
I knew Happy Gilmore
was tough...

1:14:56.788 --> 1:15:00.417
...but I can't believe he's playing
after being hit by a car.

1:15:00.751 --> 1:15:03.045
Let's hope it doesn't affect
his game.

1:15:07.007 --> 1:15:10.552
That's the first time he's failed
to outdrive McGavin.

1:15:10.761 --> 1:15:14.431
Well, well, well. Happy Gilmore is
human after all.

1:15:15.432 --> 1:15:19.728
Happy Gilmore is in trouble
if he can't hit the long ball.

1:15:20.145 --> 1:15:21.396
If he has a chance...

1:15:21.688 --> 1:15:24.942
...of winning today, he must do it
on the green.

1:15:30.572 --> 1:15:35.285
He has to focus now.
He has to save this one for par.

1:15:38.497 --> 1:15:41.208
That bogey drops him
out of the lead.

1:15:41.625 --> 1:15:44.419
If he wants to stay in this thing...

1:15:44.753 --> 1:15:46.213
...he has to calm down.

1:15:53.095 --> 1:15:56.932
Don't worry about your grandma.
She can live with me... be my maid.

1:16:03.397 --> 1:16:05.399
Look at the cabbage
he's in now.

1:16:05.607 --> 1:16:09.236
Things just keep getting worse
for Happy Gilmore.

1:16:11.989 --> 1:16:14.491
Just remember what Chubbs said.

1:16:14.783 --> 1:16:16.743
"Go to a happy place."

1:16:17.202 --> 1:16:19.496
"Go to a happy place."

1:16:57.201 --> 1:16:58.452
God!

1:17:11.215 --> 1:17:13.800
This looks like the end
for Happy Gilmore.

1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:16.178
Shooter now has
a commanding lead.

1:17:35.906 --> 1:17:37.574
Happy, look who's here.

1:17:37.908 --> 1:17:39.243
Grandma.

1:17:40.077 --> 1:17:42.788
Happy, you look upset.
What's wrong?

1:17:43.080 --> 1:17:45.833
I stink.
I'm not going to win.

1:17:46.124 --> 1:17:50.712
Don't worry, sweetheart. The house
isn't important. It's just a house.

1:17:51.046 --> 1:17:53.423
Stop fraternizing with the help,
Gilmore.

1:17:53.715 --> 1:17:56.677
Just hit your ball,
if you can find it.

1:17:57.302 --> 1:17:58.428
Hi, Grandma.

1:17:59.471 --> 1:18:03.934
Forget him. I just want you
to be happy, darling.

1:18:06.562 --> 1:18:07.938
All right, Grandma.

1:18:14.486 --> 1:18:17.281
Grandma wants me
to be happy.

1:18:38.677 --> 1:18:41.889
Chin up, Happy.
Don't feel bad about me.

1:18:42.306 --> 1:18:44.099
I got my hand back, see?

1:18:46.477 --> 1:18:49.104
We've only just begun

1:18:51.315 --> 1:18:53.984
To live

1:18:55.777 --> 1:18:58.822
White lace and promises

1:19:00.991 --> 1:19:04.953
A kiss for luck
and we're on our way

1:19:14.546 --> 1:19:19.134
It ain't over yet, McGavin. The way
I see it, we've only just begun.

1:19:46.870 --> 1:19:49.998
Happy, the gold jacket's yours.
Shooter will choke.

1:19:55.420 --> 1:19:56.463
Unbelievable!

1:20:08.767 --> 1:20:12.855
Damn you people!
This is golf, not a rock concert!

1:20:19.695 --> 1:20:20.863
Putz!

1:20:40.257 --> 1:20:41.592
Happy...

1:20:42.134 --> 1:20:43.677
...rules!

1:20:57.441 --> 1:21:00.068
Happy Gilmore has charged
in the back nine...

1:21:00.194 --> 1:21:02.446
...and is now even
with Shooter McGavin.

1:21:02.779 --> 1:21:06.116
If Shooter doesn't get
out of the funk he's in...

1:21:06.450 --> 1:21:08.702
...he may miss out
on the gold jacket.

1:21:09.161 --> 1:21:13.415
Ladies and gentlemen, the 18th hole
is a par three, 160 yards.

1:21:13.624 --> 1:21:16.460
In the event of a tie,
there will be a play-off.

1:21:16.752 --> 1:21:19.254
Mr. Gilmore,
you have the honors.

1:21:20.506 --> 1:21:22.800
No matter what,
I'm having fun.

1:21:23.133 --> 1:21:25.385
You're starting
to sound like a golfer.

1:21:25.719 --> 1:21:27.596
I know. Keep it down.

1:21:47.616 --> 1:21:51.245
Nice shot! Fifteen feet
short of the hole.

1:22:03.173 --> 1:22:05.134
Shooter's ball is
in the woods.

1:22:05.467 --> 1:22:09.179
Happy's on the 18th green,
where a car driven by a crazed fan...

1:22:09.513 --> 1:22:11.098
...rammed the TV tower.

1:22:14.017 --> 1:22:16.478
Let me through...
I'm looking for my ball.

1:22:16.687 --> 1:22:20.649
This is golf, okay? Excuse me.
Thank you.

1:22:26.530 --> 1:22:27.656
Is this your ball?

1:22:28.490 --> 1:22:30.159
Yes, it is.

1:22:30.367 --> 1:22:32.119
It struck my foot.

1:22:32.578 --> 1:22:33.787
Doug!

1:22:35.164 --> 1:22:36.748
Do I get a drop?

1:22:37.875 --> 1:22:40.043
The rule says,
"Play it as it lies."

1:23:03.734 --> 1:23:05.402
That's two so far, Shooter.

1:23:05.736 --> 1:23:07.905
You can count.
Good for you.

1:23:08.238 --> 1:23:12.409
And you can count on me waiting
for you in the parking lot.

1:23:26.256 --> 1:23:27.591
You're still away.

1:23:27.925 --> 1:23:29.927
I'm aware of that.
Thank you.

1:23:31.053 --> 1:23:32.012
I can't see.

1:23:32.304 --> 1:23:33.347
Hey, up here.

1:23:46.902 --> 1:23:49.404
Shooter needs this
to put pressure on Happy.

1:23:49.738 --> 1:23:52.199
If he misses, Happy can two-putt
to victory.

1:24:03.168 --> 1:24:04.920
Choke on that, baby!

1:24:14.847 --> 1:24:15.973
Shooter.

1:24:24.857 --> 1:24:28.819
If Gilmore sinks this, it will cap
an amazing comeback.

1:24:46.545 --> 1:24:49.339
Great. Now I have a tower
blocking my ball.

1:24:49.673 --> 1:24:53.093
We'll get it moved and you'll finish
tomorrow. Right, Doug?

1:24:53.343 --> 1:24:56.972
No, he has to hit it now.
"Play it as it lies."

1:24:57.389 --> 1:25:01.852
I hit it off Frankenstein's fat foot.
Those are the rules.

1:25:02.186 --> 1:25:05.022
He's right.
Take your shot, Mr. Gilmore.

1:25:06.148 --> 1:25:10.027
Virginia, just so you know,
my jacket size is 44 long.

1:25:10.319 --> 1:25:13.655
And my right arm is a bit longer
than my left.

1:25:14.198 --> 1:25:18.660
Hit it around the tower, sink your putt
and we'll go to sudden death.

1:25:26.043 --> 1:25:28.045
Nah, I'll just beat him now.

1:25:29.713 --> 1:25:30.631
Good luck.

1:25:36.094 --> 1:25:38.555
Chubbs, I know
you'll help me here.

1:26:14.133 --> 1:26:16.218
Oh, my God.

1:26:17.052 --> 1:26:20.931
Incredible!
Happy Gilmore wins the gold jacket.

1:26:24.143 --> 1:26:26.436
I love you. I love you.

1:26:26.728 --> 1:26:28.438
And I love you.

1:26:29.148 --> 1:26:31.441
Doug! It's impossible!

1:26:31.775 --> 1:26:34.570
That's my jacket!
It's mine!

1:26:35.404 --> 1:26:37.281
He stole my jacket!

1:26:37.906 --> 1:26:40.117
I believe that's Mr. Gilmore's.

1:27:02.097 --> 1:27:04.475
I will get you, Shooter!

1:27:05.976 --> 1:27:07.644
Stop! Stop!

1:27:08.770 --> 1:27:10.314
Be still!

1:27:10.647 --> 1:27:11.815
Don't!!!

1:27:24.828 --> 1:27:26.163
- Coming?
- You bet.

1:27:26.497 --> 1:27:27.831
All right.

1:27:41.303 --> 1:27:44.014
Here's to Chubbs,
wherever he is.

1:27:47.559 --> 1:27:49.019
Hey, Happy.

1:27:51.730 --> 1:27:53.190
Nice jacket.

1:27:56.026 --> 1:27:58.195
Who are you waving at,
Happy?

1:27:59.863 --> 1:28:02.574
Nobody, Grandma.
Let's go home.
