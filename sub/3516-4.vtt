01:34.280 --> 01:35.805
It's there
for leverage,

01:35.880 --> 01:37.928
so that we can lock down
performance standards.

01:38.080 --> 01:39.684
You don't toss
around their right

01:39.760 --> 01:41.524
to collective bargaining
like a poker chip.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.045
If we don't,
they won't budge.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.929
Has Marty Spinella
seen this?

01:45.040 --> 01:46.405
Not in the version
I showed him.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.124
So you lied to his face? No.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.761
I revised the parameters
of my promise.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.001
Which is lying.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.121
Which is politics.

01:53.240 --> 01:55.481
The sort you're
well-versed in, Bob.

01:55.600 --> 01:56.965
Here's some
politics for you.

01:57.040 --> 01:59.168
I allow this to
go to the floor,

01:59.240 --> 02:00.810
I get murdered
next election.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.889
This is coming
from the President.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.964
Last time I checked, I was
still a Democrat, Frank,

02:06.360 --> 02:09.762
and you were, too. Are you
telling me the President isn't?

02:10.000 --> 02:12.480
Because he's acting a hell
of a lot like a Republican.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.245
I thought Bob
was on our team.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.727
Just sit him down with the President.
Ten minutes.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.564
We won't touch
collective bargaining.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.290
Are you interested
in my advice on this,

02:20.360 --> 02:21.725
or you just want me to
deliver the message?

02:21.800 --> 02:23.609
I'm always interested
in your advice, Frank.

02:23.680 --> 02:26.286
Birch is right. You're going
to burn a lot of bridges.

02:26.360 --> 02:27.646
The President should
at least sit down with him

02:27.760 --> 02:29.091
and let him
make his case.

02:29.160 --> 02:33.006
You tell Bob I'm happy to schedule
a meeting with the President

02:33.080 --> 02:35.128
once he's set a date to put
this bill on the floor.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.845
The President
can fuck himself.

02:36.920 --> 02:39.287
This is the platform.
It's what he ran on.

02:39.360 --> 02:43.604
I don't give a shit what he ran on.
He can't steamroll the House.

02:43.680 --> 02:46.411
And don't forget, you work
for me, Frank, not him.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.090
If he wants something
on the floor,

02:48.200 --> 02:49.850
he's gonna have to
talk to me directly.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.605
I know you take a lot of
pride in your manhood, Bob,

02:52.680 --> 02:54.409
and it's impressive,

02:54.480 --> 02:57.450
but as big as it is, Linda can
still shut the door on it.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.011
Tell Vasquez
the bill is dead.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.329
That's not the first time
he's pulled that stunt on me.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.526
Probably should
have held my tongue,

03:09.600 --> 03:12.046
but I just couldn't resist the
chance to see him shrivel.

03:15.920 --> 03:16.921
Good morning.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.041
Frank.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.606
Mr. President.

03:20.720 --> 03:22.529
Linda.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.843
Let's strike the anti-collective
bargaining provision from the bill.

03:25.920 --> 03:26.967
Linda and I have
talked it over,

03:27.040 --> 03:28.041
and I think
she's right on this.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.963
Tell Bob he can come by
tomorrow afternoon.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.724
Sir, respectfully,
I do not think

03:31.840 --> 03:33.569
you should give
him the satisfaction.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.161
Well, give me a reason.

03:35.240 --> 03:36.526
Makes us appear weak.

03:36.840 --> 03:39.366
This is an opportunity for you
to establish your supremacy.

03:39.800 --> 03:40.926
We should seize it.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.240
But without
Birch's cooperation,

03:42.360 --> 03:43.566
we're fighting
an uphill battle

03:43.640 --> 03:45.802
before we even get the bill to the floor.
Frank, we discussed this.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.644
Sir, if you
give in now,

03:47.880 --> 03:51.123
Birch will walk all over you
for the next four years.

03:51.320 --> 03:54.927
I can get this bill on the House floor as is.
I promise you.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.485
All right, Frank.
Show me what you can do.

04:00.560 --> 04:01.561
Thank you,
Mr. President.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.560
That was her trying to
take credit for my idea.

04:08.640 --> 04:11.246
Advice she wouldn't take
from me. Unacceptable.

04:11.320 --> 04:12.890
I will not allow
her to sell my goods

04:13.000 --> 04:14.570
when she cuts me
out of the profits.

04:14.640 --> 04:17.404
I specifically told
her no interviews.

04:17.480 --> 04:19.767
She disobeyed me,
not just once.

04:19.839 --> 04:21.444
<i>At least eight
times in the past month.</i>

04:21.519 --> 04:22.726
She stays, Tom.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.087
She has no respect for
my authority, Margaret.

04:25.280 --> 04:27.123
I said she stays.

04:27.440 --> 04:29.841
There are rules. There's
a way of doing things.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.251
<i>If I have a reporter
who won't listen...</i>

04:31.320 --> 04:34.130
Two freshmen girls are moving
into their dorm room together.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.249
One of them's from Georgia, one
of them's from Connecticut.

04:37.320 --> 04:40.324
Girl from Connecticut's helping
her mother put up curtains.

04:40.400 --> 04:44.086
Girl from Georgia turns to them and says, "Hi.
Where y'all from?"

04:44.600 --> 04:46.364
<i>Girl from Connecticut says,
"We're from a place</i>

04:46.440 --> 04:49.046
<i>"where we know not to end a
sentence with a preposition."</i>

04:49.120 --> 04:52.727
Girl from Georgia says,
"Beg my pardon.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.245
"Where y'all from...

04:54.320 --> 04:55.367
"Cunt?"

04:55.480 --> 04:57.244
<i>You heard that one before?</i>

04:58.280 --> 05:00.965
A version of it.
With softer language.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.122
Tom, we don't need people
who follow the rules.

05:03.240 --> 05:04.651
We need people
with personality.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.891
<i>We want Zoe's face,
her energy.</i>

05:08.280 --> 05:10.328
We want to get her on
TV as much as possible.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.641
<i>It helps us cut
through the noise.</i>

05:12.720 --> 05:14.529
<i>See what I'm saying?</i>

05:15.880 --> 05:17.006
I hear you, Margaret.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.205
Thank you, Tom.

05:22.160 --> 05:23.525
Thank you.

05:28.280 --> 05:29.884
Come in.

05:32.720 --> 05:35.007
Oh, I thought...

05:36.440 --> 05:37.805
I wanted to say
hi to Evelyn.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.526
Evelyn?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.244
This was her office.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.205
I don't think she
works here anymore.

05:43.680 --> 05:44.966
Oh.
Gillian Cole.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.650
I came on board
a couple weeks ago.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.201
Gillian. WorldWell.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.809
Yeah. I've heard great things.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.401
Remy Danton.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.130
You work with Claire?

05:54.200 --> 05:55.201
In a way.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.161
Hello, Remy.
Claire.

05:58.680 --> 05:59.681
I see you've
met Gillian.

05:59.880 --> 06:00.927
Yes, just now.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.083
She's doing fantastic work
for us, as you can see.

06:04.160 --> 06:08.324
Red is completed wells,
green, potential sites,

06:08.400 --> 06:12.121
yellow, approved sites, and blue
are the filtration centers.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.681
Nice. So you
liking it here?

06:15.040 --> 06:16.963
Yeah. My staff
and I are loving it.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.201
Claire's opened
a lot of doors for us.

06:18.640 --> 06:19.641
Sounds like Claire.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.769
Shall we head
to my office?

06:21.880 --> 06:25.009
Gillian, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.081
What happened?

06:26.920 --> 06:27.967
Things got complicated.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.885
SanCorp was in
a difficult situation.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.890
I would have thought you'd step
up when things were difficult,

06:35.080 --> 06:36.570
not hold the
donation hostage.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.484
Well, things are
less complicated now.

06:38.560 --> 06:39.561
The donation is
back on the table.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.167
I had to fire
half my staff.

06:45.240 --> 06:46.287
Now you can
hire them back.

06:47.160 --> 06:49.401
SanCorp is prepared to double
its initial commitment.

06:49.760 --> 06:52.491
$1.5 million,
lump sum, this quarter.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.403
Why? Public relations.
Same as before.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.450
And what do they
want from Francis?

06:57.920 --> 07:00.605
Things are square with Frank.
We're only talking about the CWI.

07:00.680 --> 07:01.681
But why double it?

07:01.760 --> 07:02.966
Because I said
they should.

07:03.160 --> 07:05.083
The more they give,
the more you can do.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.163
The more you can do,
the better they look.

07:07.280 --> 07:10.443
And that's why they hired Glendon
Hill, to make them look good.

07:10.520 --> 07:12.761
And they also hired you to
get traction in Congress.

07:12.840 --> 07:13.841
Not in this case.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.004
We want a long-term
partnership, Claire.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.164
This is an investment
in the future.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.085
We're not attaching strings.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.407
I'll think about it.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.125
They'd really love to
move quickly on this.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.887
I said I'll
think about it.

07:28.360 --> 07:31.204
Madeleine, you have to email me this shit.
I need it in writing.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.805
And with more than
an hour's notice.

07:34.840 --> 07:38.049
Yeah, I know that, but you have
to understand we have a plan.

07:38.120 --> 07:41.169
We have a way that we do
this, and when you...

07:44.400 --> 07:45.526
Okay

07:46.120 --> 07:47.690
Fine.

07:48.160 --> 07:50.242
Yeah. Yeah. Bye.

07:53.880 --> 07:57.805
Madeleine has decided to have a
spur-of-the-moment trip to Orlando

07:57.880 --> 07:59.325
with her latest
eHarmony catch.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.569
No heads-up, no warning.
The kids?

08:01.640 --> 08:03.722
They get out of
school at 2:30.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.928
I can do the
Shipbuilder's meeting.

08:06.040 --> 08:09.123
You sure? Yeah, it's just
their public affairs team.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.202
I'll brief you, and then you
can call them tomorrow.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.004
Go get your kids.
Mmm.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.006
H9)'-

08:33.600 --> 08:36.683
Remy came by this morning.
To the office.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.000
What does he want?

08:38.159 --> 08:39.366
The donation's
back on the table.

08:39.440 --> 08:42.250
They've doubled
it to $1.5 million.

08:42.440 --> 08:43.520
You said no, right?

08:43.679 --> 08:44.761
I didn't.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.931
He doesn't want anything
from you, Francis.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.684
Come on, Claire.
You know better than that.

08:49.880 --> 08:51.644
I specifically asked.

08:51.760 --> 08:55.606
Maybe not right now, but look, I
invented this guy, all right?

08:55.720 --> 08:56.721
It's a slippery slope.

08:56.800 --> 08:57.801
Think of what I can
do with this money.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.641
I can hire back
the people I let go.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.245
I can help
accelerate the funding

09:02.360 --> 09:03.930
for the projects that
Gillian has brought in.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.684
Let's find another
way to raise the money.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.410
But it's right
there at my feet.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.966
Claire, I have too much
on my plate right now.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.048
I can't have SanCorp breathing
down my neck again.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.924
I can't have Remy...

09:14.000 --> 09:15.047
Look, it is Remy.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.324
He knows me too well.
It's dangerous.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.328
Look at the
bigger picture here.

09:22.720 --> 09:23.721
I'm asking.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.240
No. You're not.

09:31.800 --> 09:32.847
Claire.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.251
I'll tell you
what I told him.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.763
Which was?
I'll think about it.

09:47.360 --> 09:48.805
I know there's
been some tension,

09:48.880 --> 09:51.531
and I'm probably more
to blame than you are.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.090
But I'd like to
put that behind us.

09:54.280 --> 09:57.727
Zoe, you're going to be our new
White House correspondent.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.247
What about Janine?

10:00.760 --> 10:02.410
I promoted her to
Midwest Bureau Chief.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.241
She's okay with that? She wants
to give up the White House?

10:05.320 --> 10:07.004
It's the decision
I've made.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.447
It's just that Janine
has so much experience.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.449
I thought you'd be
more excited about this.

10:13.360 --> 10:18.605
I'm sorry. I just thought you brought
me in here to... I don't know.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.330
To fire you.
Maybe.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.406
Water under the bridge.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.361
We're starting over.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.691
So are you ready
to take this on?

10:32.640 --> 10:33.687
Can I think about it?

10:34.800 --> 10:36.404
People usually don't
have to think about it

10:36.520 --> 10:38.045
when they're offered
the White House, Zoe.

10:38.120 --> 10:39.201
Just a day or two.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.402
Janine is booked for a
flight to Chicago on Friday.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.687
I'll let you know before then.
I just need to...

10:46.320 --> 10:48.322
Thank you.
Thank you, Tom.

10:56.320 --> 10:58.084
David Rasmussen is
the majority leader,

10:58.200 --> 10:59.929
which means he's
one step above me

11:00.000 --> 11:03.163
and one below Birch, which is akin
to being between a very hungry wolf

11:03.280 --> 11:04.691
and a very
quarrelsome sheep.

11:04.920 --> 11:07.685
Let's see if he stays with
the herd or joins the pack.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.603
David. You mind
if I join you?

11:09.680 --> 11:12.206
Please. A salad, huh?

11:12.280 --> 11:14.248
Yes. I'm trying to take
better care of myself.

11:14.360 --> 11:15.566
Good man. Diet?

11:15.640 --> 11:17.722
Diet, exercise,
everything.

11:19.840 --> 11:22.002
You ought to take better
care of yourself, too.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.367
Well, then they should stop
serving such good pizza.

11:24.440 --> 11:27.330
I'm not talking
about the food.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.050
I'm talking about Birch.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.045
You are never
going to be Speaker

11:33.120 --> 11:34.724
unless you do
something about it.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.604
I'm very satisfied
where I am.

11:36.680 --> 11:38.682
Oh, come on.
For the time being, yeah.

11:38.840 --> 11:39.966
Time being never.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.769
The only way
you become Speaker

11:41.880 --> 11:43.530
is if Birch loses his
district or retires,

11:43.640 --> 11:44.641
neither of which
is going to happen

11:44.720 --> 11:46.051
before you and
I have dentures.

11:46.240 --> 11:48.208
I'm not happy where this
conversation is going, Frank.

11:48.280 --> 11:51.682
If you want it, and I know
you do, there's a way.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.691
Okay. Right.
I can't...

11:53.760 --> 11:56.366
All you need is a simple majority.
218 votes.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.807
We're going to get at
least 205 out of the GOP,

11:58.880 --> 12:00.450
and after that, all you
need is 13 Democrats.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.130
You and I make two.

12:02.240 --> 12:03.287
Are you out
of your mind?

12:05.240 --> 12:08.244
Just consider it
for a moment.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.165
You want to collude
with the Republicans?

12:11.240 --> 12:14.608
I don't want to, but I would if you
become Speaker in the process.

12:14.680 --> 12:15.806
Never been done before.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.604
There's a first
time for everything.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.006
This is ridiculous.

12:19.080 --> 12:20.525
The Republicans
would love a chance

12:20.640 --> 12:22.165
to knock Bob
down a peg or two.

12:22.440 --> 12:23.566
And you want
to help them?

12:23.800 --> 12:24.961
I want to help us.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.287
Bob will not play ball
with the White House.

12:28.360 --> 12:31.603
Now, you're a reasonable
man, David, and he's not.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.448
You know what I am?

12:35.560 --> 12:37.244
I'm a discreet man.

12:37.360 --> 12:38.521
You're lucky for that.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.364
I'm not going to
mention this to Bob,

12:40.480 --> 12:42.289
but if you ever
bring it up again,

12:42.360 --> 12:44.089
I won't have a choice.

12:46.840 --> 12:49.411
Looks like he
opted for the herd.

12:55.280 --> 12:58.887
Claire. I'd like to put an
order for the water filters

12:58.960 --> 13:01.566
and the well-digging equipment
for the South Sudan project.

13:01.640 --> 13:02.880
Can we talk
about the budget?

13:02.960 --> 13:04.610
How much?
$200,000.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.240
For one project?

13:06.320 --> 13:07.321
I know it's a lot,

13:07.400 --> 13:10.085
but it'll be our flagship
project in Africa,

13:10.160 --> 13:13.130
and we would be the first organization
there to work on this scale.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.683
I'd like to go over
the specifics first.

13:15.760 --> 13:16.841
I have the budget
right here.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.809
Let me just grab my messages,
and then I'll come in to you.

13:18.880 --> 13:21.326
Okay. I'll be
in my office.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.729
Any calls
while I was out?

13:23.800 --> 13:26.929
They're on the desk,
and this came by messenger.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.403
Adam. It's Claire.

14:10.600 --> 14:14.207
Yes. I know. It has.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.651
No reason. I was just
thinking about you.

14:21.040 --> 14:25.284
You're right. It is a lie.
I do have a reason.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.249
I need to use you.

14:27.320 --> 14:30.290
The White House is where news goes to die.
Everything's canned.

14:30.360 --> 14:32.124
These perfectly
prepared statements...

14:32.200 --> 14:33.611
It's a prestigious
job, Zoe.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.401
Used to be, when I was in ninth grade.
Now it's a graveyard.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.369
The only halfway
interesting thing they do

14:39.560 --> 14:41.449
is throw a big dinner
party once a year

14:41.520 --> 14:43.204
where they pat
themselves on the back

14:43.360 --> 14:45.010
and rub shoulders
with movie stars.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.161
Who needs that?

14:46.320 --> 14:47.367
Every day since
you started here,

14:47.440 --> 14:49.124
you've begged me to move you
up, and now suddenly...

14:49.240 --> 14:52.130
My goal in life is not to
climb up The Herald's ladder

14:52.240 --> 14:53.890
one rung at a time until
I've got my own stationery.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.927
Some of us value a career
at a paper like this.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.724
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
for that to come off...

14:59.840 --> 15:01.842
Well, it did, and you skipped
a few rungs, by the way.

15:02.480 --> 15:03.527
Do what you
want to do, Zoe,

15:03.600 --> 15:04.965
but if you want me to
be your cheerleader

15:05.040 --> 15:06.690
and say, "Yeah, turn
it down," I won't.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.727
I would have killed for that job
when I first started here.

15:16.920 --> 15:19.207
Put Fichner in the
"leaning yes" column.

15:19.760 --> 15:20.807
Don't you think
he's a neutral?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.001
He hates Birch.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.889
Yeah, but he owes Birch for the
Ways and Means appointment.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.724
Put him in "neutral."
Who else?

15:28.040 --> 15:29.644
Ramirez as a neutral?

15:29.760 --> 15:32.081
Oh, this list
is so shaky.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.531
Any one of them
leaks it to Bob...

15:33.600 --> 15:35.170
No, what we need
is one name.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.610
One person who
can deliver 12.

15:39.520 --> 15:40.521
The Black Caucus.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.480
Womack.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.608
What can we offer him?
What does he need?

15:47.880 --> 15:49.211
Let me pull up his file.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.001
Here we go.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.163
McCuddin Airforce base employs
3,000 people in his district.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.285
It's on the DOD's
chopping block this year.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.521
Who do we know on
the BRAC commission?

16:01.800 --> 16:03.450
That's dangerous.

16:03.520 --> 16:06.444
The trail leads back to us trying
to influence the DOD or the BRAC.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.568
No, no,no. What we do is
we close another base.

16:08.640 --> 16:10.483
We leave enough money
in the DOD's budget

16:10.560 --> 16:12.210
to keep Womack's
base off the list.

16:12.280 --> 16:13.805
What we need...

16:19.480 --> 16:21.005
Is someone we own.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.329
Dad, I'm hungry.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.447
Coming, buddy.

16:28.840 --> 16:29.966
Here we go.

16:30.200 --> 16:33.170
With cheese.
Without cheese.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.530
Umm, Dad?

16:36.640 --> 16:37.641
Yeah.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.649
That looks
pretty disgusting.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.768
Yeah, it looks disgusting.

16:43.560 --> 16:45.324
It's not how it looks,
it's how it tastes.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.370
And a fork
would be nice.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.531
Shit. Okay. Hold on.

16:53.760 --> 16:54.841
Hello.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.041
<i>DOORMAN: Good evening,
Mr. Russo.</i>

16:56.200 --> 16:57.326
<i>There's a Mr. Underwood
here to see you.</i>

16:57.840 --> 16:58.841
Uh...

16:59.840 --> 17:00.921
Okay. Send him up.

17:15.319 --> 17:16.320
Hi, there.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.367
Hi.
Hi.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.369
This is Kevin,
this is Sarah.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.249
Hi. I'm Frank.
Nice to meet you both.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.169
Do you work with Dad?
I do.

17:24.240 --> 17:26.003
Congressman Underwood
is Daddy's boss.

17:26.359 --> 17:27.771
I thought you
didn't have a boss.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.401
Everybody has a boss,
sweetheart, even Congressmen.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.090
Why don't you take your dinner
and go into the bedroom?

17:33.200 --> 17:35.009
But I wanted to watch TV.
Go now.

17:36.440 --> 17:39.887
Cute kids. Yeah, I like them.
Can I get you a drink?

17:39.960 --> 17:41.769
No, I won't
be here long.

17:41.840 --> 17:44.002
Yeah. Have a seat.

17:44.400 --> 17:47.244
Thank you.
Is that a PS Vita?

17:47.320 --> 17:48.321
Uh...

17:51.040 --> 17:52.929
Which games
does he have?

17:53.000 --> 17:55.082
All of them.
I have a console at home.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.886
I play sometimes to relax. I ought
to get one of these for the car.

18:01.840 --> 18:06.084
So, Peter, we need to close the
shipyard in your district.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.931
The BRAC hearing is tomorrow. You
won't put up your usual fight.

18:09.040 --> 18:11.168
You have zero
testimony to add.

18:13.320 --> 18:15.209
I can't do that.
Yes, you can, Peter.

18:16.040 --> 18:17.929
I spent months
on that testimony.

18:18.040 --> 18:19.883
I lobbied the commission.
My entire office...

18:19.960 --> 18:21.530
I'm sure you've
done splendid work,

18:21.600 --> 18:23.409
but unfortunately, it
can't come to fruition.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.409
Why?
Politics.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.482
There's forces bigger than
either of us at play here.

18:27.760 --> 18:29.046
It's 12,000 jobs.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.326
I know.
It's a shame.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.528
Keeping that shipyard open
is what got me elected.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.041
Those people
are my friends.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.122
I'm not here to
debate this, Peter.

18:36.360 --> 18:38.522
The base will close.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.682
The only question is, will
you make it a swift death

18:40.760 --> 18:42.171
or a painful one?

18:43.520 --> 18:45.682
No way. I won't
sit on my hands.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.770
I sympathize that this is
gonna be difficult for you.

18:48.840 --> 18:50.569
And I don't
know how yet,

18:50.640 --> 18:52.881
but I will make it
up to you, Peter.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.729
I'm a powerful friend
to have right now,

18:56.800 --> 18:58.484
perhaps your
only friend,

18:59.200 --> 19:01.282
so don't defy me.

19:12.720 --> 19:15.291
Love of family.

19:15.480 --> 19:18.529
Most politicians are permanently
chained to that slogan.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.006
Family values.

19:20.440 --> 19:23.250
But when you cozy up to
hookers and I find out,

19:23.320 --> 19:25.846
I will make that
hypocrisy hurt.

19:29.680 --> 19:32.604
Did you get the
present I sent you?

19:33.560 --> 19:36.040
You wouldn't really
call it a present.

19:36.120 --> 19:39.249
Well, more of a
gentle reminder, maybe.

19:39.760 --> 19:42.604
More heavy-handed than
gentle, which surprised me.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.648
It's not really
your style, Francis.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.209
But, yes. I got it.

19:48.360 --> 19:50.681
I like that one.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.091
I do, too.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.486
But the first
one's better.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.686
You think?

19:55.360 --> 19:56.646
Something special tomorrow?

19:56.960 --> 19:58.928
Adam Galloway's coming
down from New York.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.001
What for?

20:00.160 --> 20:01.844
Because I need some
of his photographs

20:01.920 --> 20:05.049
for the silent auction
at the gala next month.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.121
You speak to Remy yet?

20:10.080 --> 20:11.081
I haven't.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.202
If you want to look inviting,
wear the black one.

20:20.360 --> 20:21.930
Hello.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.001
Oh...

20:23.480 --> 20:25.687
Okay. Great. Thanks.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.411
Adam?

20:41.880 --> 20:43.530
How is it the world
keeps spinning

20:43.640 --> 20:45.324
and you manage to
stay ahead of it?

20:48.880 --> 20:49.961
David's on board
with this?

20:50.080 --> 20:51.206
It was his idea.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.327
Then why
isn't he here?

20:52.400 --> 20:54.562
Well, we have to be careful
until it's a done deal.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.843
I don't know, Frank.
Think about it, Terry.

20:56.920 --> 20:59.810
You could become the first
African-American majority leader

20:59.880 --> 21:01.370
in the United States
Congress.

21:02.360 --> 21:05.091
Let's make some history.

21:05.880 --> 21:07.450
You don't care
about history.

21:07.640 --> 21:09.722
You just wanted me because
I can round up the votes.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.406
I need the votes, and I
do care about history,

21:12.480 --> 21:15.848
but most importantly, Terry,
you know how to lead.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.128
You're the head of the
Black Caucus for a reason.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.970
So David becomes speaker,
I become majority leader...

21:22.040 --> 21:23.530
And I stay on as Whip.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.122
Why don't you want majority
leader for yourself?

21:26.200 --> 21:27.850
I'm satisfied where I am.

21:27.920 --> 21:31.322
Maybe one day, when you become
Speaker, you'll bump me up.

21:31.400 --> 21:33.289
This is the sort of thing
that there's no turning back.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.524
I can throw a
cherry on top.

21:38.640 --> 21:39.971
McCuddin stays open.

21:41.880 --> 21:42.881
H ow?

21:42.960 --> 21:44.405
You don't want
to know how.

21:44.480 --> 21:47.927
You just want the headline when you
keep 3,000 jobs in your district.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.724
12 votes?
12 votes.

21:53.800 --> 21:55.643
I can get you 10,
probably 11.

21:56.320 --> 21:57.970
It's so refreshing
to work with someone

21:58.040 --> 21:59.610
who will throw a saddle
on a gift horse

21:59.680 --> 22:00.966
rather than look
it in the mouth.

22:10.920 --> 22:12.081
That's nice.

22:17.720 --> 22:18.721
Wow.

22:19.160 --> 22:22.369
I found her in
a village outside Amravati.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.090
Her name was Tyala.

22:24.160 --> 22:26.242
She died three weeks
after I took that picture.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.004
Oh, that's awful.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.730
You can have
them all if you like.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.689
I love your hair short.

22:37.120 --> 22:38.167
You have plans tonight?

22:40.960 --> 22:42.041
No.

22:42.120 --> 22:44.327
Is Frank
expecting you home?

22:44.400 --> 22:46.448
I'm sure he'll
be home late.

22:46.520 --> 22:47.521
Get dinner with me.

22:49.800 --> 22:50.881
What time is your train?

22:51.560 --> 22:53.085
I don't book
round-trip tickets.

22:56.520 --> 22:58.363
It's going to be a while
before I can leave.

22:58.480 --> 22:59.766
What time will
you be done?

23:02.720 --> 23:04.563
Probably around 8:00.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.929
I'll pick a place,
let you know.

23:22.440 --> 23:23.771
Ah, David.

23:24.520 --> 23:26.010
How are you, Joe?

23:26.880 --> 23:28.803
I'm behind you.
Let's do this.

23:28.960 --> 23:29.961
DO what?

23:31.720 --> 23:34.610
Keep your cards close.
I like that.

24:17.120 --> 24:21.045
Hi. Yeah.
This is room 1214.

24:21.120 --> 24:25.489
I'd like a bottle of
the Weinbach, please.

24:27.440 --> 24:30.410
Yeah. Actually, could you
make that two bottles?

24:31.320 --> 24:32.890
Thank you.

24:33.320 --> 24:34.970
Sit down. You're
making me nervous.

24:41.880 --> 24:44.486
You still smoke?
From time to time, yes.

24:46.720 --> 24:50.167
I quit. These are
an illusion.

24:51.960 --> 24:53.007
You want?

24:53.160 --> 24:54.207
Sure.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.049
What?

25:59.400 --> 26:00.561
Not now.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.240
OK3)'-

26:02.800 --> 26:04.245
I should go.

26:05.080 --> 26:06.127
I just...
assumed...

26:06.240 --> 26:07.321
I know.

26:09.560 --> 26:11.130
We can't start
this again.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.567
When I end something,
I end it.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.443
So Why'd you have me come all
the way down from New York?

26:18.880 --> 26:20.041
It was a mistake.

26:22.280 --> 26:24.931
I'm sorry, Adam. I should've
kept it business.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.724
Side of you
I like the least

26:41.280 --> 26:43.203
There are no
mistakes, Claire.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.649
Hi.
Hello.

27:02.840 --> 27:04.808
More wine?
Mmm-hmm.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.248
How was your day?

27:11.960 --> 27:13.928
Good.
Adam well?

27:14.360 --> 27:15.771
He is.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.130
We just had dinner.

27:19.560 --> 27:20.561
Hmm.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.886
I emailed Remy
on the way home.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.803
I told him I'm not
taking the money.

27:32.120 --> 27:36.045
Thank you. I appreciate
that this was not easy.

27:36.120 --> 27:38.122
Well, we don't
like easy, do we?

27:38.200 --> 27:41.568
All the evidence
would suggest it.

27:42.080 --> 27:43.241
Is it all right
if the Holburns

27:43.320 --> 27:44.651
come over for
dinner Wednesday night?

27:44.720 --> 27:46.961
I want Felicity to buy
some tables for the gala.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.486
Yeah, of course.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.928
I'm going to need Congressmen
and senators there.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.126
You need to
call in favors.

27:53.240 --> 27:54.366
Done.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.965
Not a few, a lot.

27:56.040 --> 27:58.441
I'll start making
calls in the morning.

27:59.960 --> 28:02.008
Adam donated
10 photographs.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.242
That was generous
of him.

28:07.640 --> 28:09.449
He's staying
at the Mandarin.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.966
And you?

28:14.040 --> 28:16.122
Here.

28:23.960 --> 28:25.849
<i>DALTON: But the Proving
Ground's importance</i>

28:25.920 --> 28:28.764
<i>stems far beyond its
strategic geographic value.</i>

28:29.120 --> 28:32.966
<i>APG's research and development
of military material</i>

28:33.040 --> 28:36.408
<i>is central to our nation's
counter-terrorism efforts.</i>

28:36.520 --> 28:40.047
<i>The base houses research laboratories
for preventative medicine</i>

28:40.120 --> 28:43.886
<i>as well as a wide variety of training
grounds for military personnel.</i>

28:44.400 --> 28:47.290
<i>APG is also a job creator.</i>

28:47.400 --> 28:51.450
<i>It provides $400 million
in payroll annually,</i>

28:51.680 --> 28:54.650
<i>and nearly $500 million
in contracts.</i>

28:55.040 --> 28:57.930
<i>Thank you for the opportunity
to testify before you today.</i>

28:58.040 --> 29:01.249
<i>Any questions for the
Congresswoman from Maryland?</i>

29:01.320 --> 29:03.163
No.

29:03.240 --> 29:06.483
<i>Those in favor of removing
the Aberdeen Proving Ground</i>

29:06.560 --> 29:08.483
<i>from the list of closures?</i>

29:08.600 --> 29:09.840
<i>Aye.
Aye.</i>

29:09.920 --> 29:11.649
<i>So noted and removed.</i>

29:13.240 --> 29:17.165
<i>Okay, we'll next consider the
Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.</i>

29:17.240 --> 29:19.766
<i>Would the congressman from
Pennsylvania's first district</i>

29:19.840 --> 29:21.604
<i>like to offer testimony?</i>

29:30.400 --> 29:32.243
I have no testimony to offer.

29:39.080 --> 29:41.287
Yeah, but the difference
that we're gonna make...

29:41.520 --> 29:43.887
Uh, Terry, let me
call you right back.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.651
Terry Womack?

29:46.720 --> 29:47.721
Possibly.

29:47.800 --> 29:49.529
I've had three members of
the Black Caucus tell me

29:49.640 --> 29:50.971
they're backing my
play for the speakership.

29:52.080 --> 29:53.570
Interesting.
I have a sense

29:53.640 --> 29:55.927
you've been disseminating
some misinformation.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.207
No. I'm afraid it's you
who are misinformed, David.

29:58.280 --> 30:01.170
You don't have three members backing you.
You have 10.

30:02.040 --> 30:04.486
I made it very clear I didn't
want any part of this.

30:04.560 --> 30:06.005
Yes, you made it
crystal clear.

30:06.080 --> 30:07.366
Then why are you
telling people?

30:07.440 --> 30:09.647
Because they don't know
you made it crystal clear.

30:09.960 --> 30:11.166
I have to go to
Bob with this.

30:11.320 --> 30:13.129
He'll think you
organized a coup,

30:13.200 --> 30:15.851
got cold feet, and are
making me the scapegoat.

30:17.160 --> 30:19.322
David, if I pick up
this phone right now

30:19.400 --> 30:20.686
and leak this story,

30:21.320 --> 30:23.926
Bob will have no
choice but to drop you,

30:24.000 --> 30:27.049
even if he believes
your version of events.

30:30.920 --> 30:32.046
You wanna take a seat?

30:36.200 --> 30:37.929
Ah, Freddy?
Yeah, Frank?

30:38.080 --> 30:39.570
You better make
it a half order.

30:39.640 --> 30:40.846
I got a big
dinner tonight.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.366
Sure thing.

30:43.640 --> 30:46.405
Slaw? Uh-huh. You got it.
Always.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.531
Here you go.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.281
So, what's the latest?

30:56.360 --> 30:58.203
You know, Frank.
Same old shit.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.610
Almost got killed
last weekend.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.361
Here?
No.

31:02.680 --> 31:04.091
State fair
down in Virginia.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.647
Me and my brother hauling
this smoker down there,

31:07.040 --> 31:09.884
and this fucking minivan
had a fridge strapped on top.

31:10.160 --> 31:13.607
A fridge strapped on
top of a minivan, Frank.

31:13.720 --> 31:16.166
That's stupid. Well, that
fridge slipped loose.

31:16.720 --> 31:19.849
Boom! Right in front of us. I had to
swerve to the left. Barely missed it.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.002
But now that smoker
is fishtailing,

31:22.120 --> 31:24.202
almost hit a hatchback
in the next lane.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.362
Swerved to the right.
Barely missed that, too.

31:26.440 --> 31:28.568
Jesus.
Oh, man, it was real.

31:28.840 --> 31:30.763
But, you know, that's
why God gave us reflexes.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.485
So we can move
the fuck out of the way

31:32.600 --> 31:33.965
when a fridge
come out of nowhere.

31:36.440 --> 31:37.646
How are them ribs?

31:37.760 --> 31:39.000
You know
how they are.

31:39.280 --> 31:40.725
You know I like
to hear it.

31:40.840 --> 31:42.330
Perfection, Freddy.

31:42.440 --> 31:44.761
Perfection.

31:44.920 --> 31:46.081
You go on ahead, Frank.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.401
Thank you, Freddy.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.405
Well, this is a surprise.

31:50.720 --> 31:52.609
<i>You usually text.
Where are you?</i>

31:52.960 --> 31:54.166
On the other side
of the tracks

31:54.280 --> 31:55.520
trying to find
the meaning of life.

31:56.600 --> 31:57.840
Find anything for me?

31:58.280 --> 31:59.645
You mean anything
newsworthy?

32:00.360 --> 32:02.601
I actually didn't
call to badger you.

32:02.920 --> 32:05.446
Yes, you did, but that's
part of your charm.

32:05.520 --> 32:08.205
No. I wanted to
tell you that

32:09.360 --> 32:12.091
I've been promoted to White
House correspondent.

32:17.400 --> 32:20.131
I'll have to travel with the
press corps, be at briefings,

32:20.200 --> 32:23.010
but I can work
around all that.

32:23.480 --> 32:25.323
If you need me. It won't
change anything.

32:25.720 --> 32:28.644
Oh, on the contrary.
This changes everything.

32:28.960 --> 32:30.166
No.I can
be flexible.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.563
I'm not interested in
someone who's flexible,

32:32.720 --> 32:34.643
I'm interested in
someone who's available.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.081
So you think I
should turn it down?

32:36.480 --> 32:37.925
That's entirely
up to you.

32:38.440 --> 32:40.681
Well, I mean,
it's not official yet.

32:40.800 --> 32:42.006
<i>I could... Oh, look,
I've got to go,</i>

32:42.120 --> 32:45.647
but call me, you know, if you
find yourself available again.

32:51.120 --> 32:54.442
You see, Freddy believes that if
a fridge falls off a minivan,

32:54.520 --> 32:56.363
you better swerve
out of its way.

32:56.440 --> 32:59.489
I believe it's the fridge's
job to swerve out of mine.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.323
Hey, Janine...

33:10.440 --> 33:12.807
Keep walking, Zoe. I really don't
want to talk to you right now.

33:13.480 --> 33:14.891
It's not like I
asked him for it.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.411
He just called me
into his office, and...

33:16.480 --> 33:18.767
Oh, please. You've
been gunning for my job

33:18.840 --> 33:21.525
since the day you bounced in here
with a lollipop in your mouth.

33:21.800 --> 33:22.847
Congratulations.

33:23.160 --> 33:24.889
I'll send you a bottle of
champagne from the Middle West,

33:25.320 --> 33:26.924
wherever the
fuck that is.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.970
I'm gonna turn it down.
You don't have to leave.

33:30.040 --> 33:31.690
Are you trying to rub
this in or something?

33:31.760 --> 33:34.161
Please believe me. You should
be in the White House.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.522
I don't want it.
I never did.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.446
I was hoping we could
go see Tom together.

33:40.520 --> 33:41.681
I want him to
know that we both...

33:41.840 --> 33:42.966
Get the fuck
out of my face.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.811
I'm asking. For real.
I don't want the job.

33:46.040 --> 33:48.611
Then you're an even bigger
idiot than I thought you were.

33:48.680 --> 33:50.125
Go. Before I get violent.

34:10.920 --> 34:12.967
Peter?

34:16.080 --> 34:17.525
Hello?

34:20.880 --> 34:24.771
Hi. My name is Christina.
I work with your dad.

34:24.840 --> 34:26.808
He's not here.
Where'd he go?

34:26.880 --> 34:29.201
I don't know. He said he'd
be back in a little while.

34:30.400 --> 34:31.925
When was that?

34:32.000 --> 34:35.368
When he dropped us
home from school.

34:36.440 --> 34:37.565
He left his phone here.

34:39.800 --> 34:42.326
Are you Dad's
girlfriend?

34:42.400 --> 34:45.927
No. No. I work
for your dad.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.809
Then why do you have the
keys to his apartment?

34:50.600 --> 34:52.090
Will you make us Pop-Tarts?

34:56.440 --> 34:58.329
It was just
sublime, Claire.

34:58.480 --> 35:00.448
- Thank you.
- I don't think I'll eat for a week.

35:00.680 --> 35:03.047
Does that mean no
room for dessert?

35:03.200 --> 35:05.282
I'd love to,
but none for me.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.370
Why don't you and
I head downstairs

35:07.480 --> 35:09.084
for a little brandy
and some cigars?

35:09.160 --> 35:10.207
Cubans?

35:10.280 --> 35:12.169
You don't think I smoke
anything legal, do you?

35:14.400 --> 35:16.243
Dessert for you?
No. No, thanks.

35:16.320 --> 35:18.129
But I will take a refill of
this Chardonnay, though.

35:18.240 --> 35:21.369
Of course. This is almost out.
I'll grab another.

35:37.680 --> 35:41.571
I hate how they just hit you
like that with no warning.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.688
You get night
sweats, too?

35:45.600 --> 35:47.204
I, umm...

35:48.560 --> 35:51.291
This is very
new to me.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.401
Does Frank know?

35:53.680 --> 35:56.684
I haven't...
We haven't... No.

35:58.160 --> 36:00.162
I'm sorry. We don't have
to talk about this.

36:00.240 --> 36:04.086
No. It's fine.
I'm just...

36:04.360 --> 36:07.204
It's fine.
I feel better now.

36:07.320 --> 36:08.845
Could I have a little bit more?
Sure.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.047
Just say when.

36:11.160 --> 36:12.286
Charles is driving
tonight, so...

36:13.760 --> 36:15.000
And when.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.923
Cheers.
Cheers.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.400
So, you mentioned, when
you invited me, the CWI.

36:26.520 --> 36:29.205
You're having a gala and
launching some new...

36:29.320 --> 36:30.845
Yes, that's right.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.525
We just brought on this
brilliant young woman

36:32.600 --> 36:35.968
who's going to help us
expand our efforts overseas.

36:36.040 --> 36:38.042
Claire, I will save
you the trouble.

36:38.320 --> 36:40.049
Charles and I would be
delighted to contribute.

36:41.320 --> 36:43.288
Well, that's very generous
of you, Felicity.

36:43.680 --> 36:46.286
Well, you were such a darling, getting
us tickets to the Jefferson Ball.

36:46.680 --> 36:47.727
Oh, that was nothing.

36:47.840 --> 36:48.887
It wasn't nothing.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.530
It was...

36:50.600 --> 36:54.730
People in this town don't go out of
their way to be nice to each other.

36:55.240 --> 36:58.642
Fourteen years Charles and
I have been here, and...

36:58.720 --> 37:00.848
Anyway, um...

37:00.960 --> 37:03.361
I'm grateful to
have a friend.

37:06.240 --> 37:07.571
How much
do you need?

37:19.560 --> 37:21.244
Christina, what the fuck
are you doing here?

37:21.360 --> 37:22.885
Shh! They're sleeping.

37:31.080 --> 37:32.730
Peter.

38:22.080 --> 38:24.003
Hey, Dad.
Hey, kiddo.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.005
Would you take your
brother downstairs?

38:26.080 --> 38:27.411
I'll be there
in a second.

38:27.520 --> 38:28.806
Okay.
Bye, Dad.

38:29.400 --> 38:30.731
Bye.

38:30.840 --> 38:32.251
Bye?
Where they going?

38:32.680 --> 38:35.081
I'm taking them to
their grandmother's.

38:35.160 --> 38:37.162
I was able to get a hold of
Madeleine, and I told her...

38:37.240 --> 38:38.366
Fuck. You didn't
tell her?

38:39.480 --> 38:43.201
No, I didn't.
But I should have.

38:43.320 --> 38:45.322
I told her that you had
to travel for work,

38:45.440 --> 38:47.761
which is the last time
lever lie for you.

38:49.840 --> 38:51.001
Lookâ€œ.

38:51.160 --> 38:52.366
What happened, Peter?

38:53.320 --> 38:56.324
I'm sorry about
the BRAC hearing.

38:56.920 --> 38:59.526
Fuck the BRAC hearing.
What about your kids?

39:03.440 --> 39:04.771
After I drop
them off, I'm done.

39:04.840 --> 39:07.286
I am no longer your girlfriend.
I no longer work for you.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.089
No. Hey, Christina...

39:09.200 --> 39:11.965
I don't want to hear it, Peter.
There's no excuse this time.

39:19.520 --> 39:20.681
I don't have
much time, Frank.

39:20.800 --> 39:21.961
I'll make it short.

39:22.040 --> 39:24.042
The President?
No. The speakership.

39:24.600 --> 39:25.601
David's making a play.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.929
What? He came to me for support.

39:28.040 --> 39:29.644
My first thought was
to tell you right away,

39:29.760 --> 39:32.206
but then my second thought was
to ignore my first thought,

39:32.280 --> 39:34.726
because we have
the votes, Bob.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.122
If there had been a party revolt,
I would've known about it.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.680
We don't need the whole party to revolt.
We need 13...

39:40.040 --> 39:42.088
Thirteen Democrats, plus the
other side of the aisle.

39:42.840 --> 39:44.251
Are you out
of your mind?

39:44.360 --> 39:46.044
People have been asking
me that a lot lately.

39:46.200 --> 39:47.964
I'm inclined to
start saying yes.

39:48.440 --> 39:50.044
Who are they, the 13?

39:50.120 --> 39:52.088
David and I are two,
Terry Womack,

39:52.200 --> 39:54.726
and 10 members of the Black
Caucus make another 11.

39:55.080 --> 39:56.445
Is the President
behind this?

39:56.520 --> 39:57.931
No. He doesn't
have a clue.

39:58.040 --> 40:00.691
This was David's
plan executed by me.

40:00.760 --> 40:02.922
But there is
an out for you, Bob.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.084
I can sway Womack
either way

40:05.160 --> 40:09.006
as long as you make him
the next majority leader.

40:09.080 --> 40:11.003
And...

40:11.080 --> 40:12.411
The Education Bill.

40:12.520 --> 40:13.851
Now we're on
the same page.

40:13.920 --> 40:15.888
I can't do that.
You know I can't.

40:16.040 --> 40:19.123
You're the Speaker, Bob. You
can do anything you'd like.

40:19.200 --> 40:21.567
And I have to say,
appointing the first

40:21.680 --> 40:24.001
African-American
majority leader,

40:24.080 --> 40:27.243
why, that isn't
a bad legacy to have.

40:28.880 --> 40:30.848
I'm sorry.
I changed my mind.

40:31.080 --> 40:32.127
I thought
about it, and--, andâ€œ.

40:32.240 --> 40:35.050
Thinking about it was what
those two days were for.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.521
And then I thought about it
some more, and I realized I...

40:37.600 --> 40:40.285
Jesus Christ, you're
fucking unbelievable.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.289
Look, Tom, I
appreciate the fact

40:42.360 --> 40:43.771
that you took
a chance on me, but...

40:43.840 --> 40:47.765
No, I don't think you do. I don't
think you appreciate anything.

40:47.880 --> 40:50.451
I think you're an ungrateful,
self-entitled little...

40:51.480 --> 40:52.481
Little what?

40:53.720 --> 40:55.449
Little what, Tom?
Say it.

40:55.880 --> 40:58.451
Cunt. You're a cunt.

41:03.480 --> 41:05.130
What are you doing?

41:05.640 --> 41:06.721
Don't you dare...

41:06.800 --> 41:09.007
You don't even
know what I'm typing.

41:09.120 --> 41:11.122
Get out, Zoe. Just a second.
I'm almost done.

41:12.280 --> 41:14.248
Get out.
You're fired.

41:14.320 --> 41:17.051
Whatever you have to
tell yourself, Tom.

41:17.160 --> 41:18.321
Get out!

41:20.480 --> 41:21.811
So should I
press send?

41:23.040 --> 41:24.087
I think I should.

41:27.280 --> 41:29.009
Call me whatever you want,

41:29.120 --> 41:31.407
but you should remember,
these days,

41:31.480 --> 41:34.609
when you're talking to one
person, you're talking to 1,000.

41:50.800 --> 41:53.087
<i>BOB: Well, you'll say you
wanted to spend more time</i>

41:53.160 --> 41:54.605
<i>focusing on
your home district.</i>

41:55.240 --> 41:58.005
You'll say Womack is the right
man to fill your shoes.

41:58.480 --> 42:01.165
You won't make waves.
You won't do interviews.

42:01.240 --> 42:03.766
You'll suck it up
and be a team player.

42:05.040 --> 42:06.371
This was Frank's idea.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.408
I told you he was gonna
try to blame me on it.

42:08.480 --> 42:09.641
Ask around.
Talk to Womack.

42:09.720 --> 42:11.688
I did. He said
you came to him.

42:11.880 --> 42:14.247
He's fucking lying, Bob!
I would never...

42:14.360 --> 42:15.771
Shut up, David.

42:16.080 --> 42:20.961
Do you understand how you're to
behave when we make the announcement?

42:21.040 --> 42:22.485
And if I don't
play along?

42:22.600 --> 42:25.649
Then the DCCC will pour
everything it's got

42:25.720 --> 42:28.644
into your primary opponent's
campaign next cycle.

42:28.720 --> 42:32.202
We'll cleave you from the herd and
watch you die in the wilderness.

42:34.760 --> 42:36.524
- Tell us now, David.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.404
If you think
it's best, Robert.

42:47.560 --> 42:50.484
And just think,
he could have been a wolf.

43:23.840 --> 43:25.808
You made yourself
available.

43:25.880 --> 43:29.601
I quit.
Fuck that place.

43:29.680 --> 43:32.331
It was a prison.
I'm free now.

43:32.800 --> 43:34.211
Congratulations.

43:34.280 --> 43:35.645
Where are you?

43:35.720 --> 43:36.846
<i>In a car.</i>

43:36.920 --> 43:37.921
So am I.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.206
Where you headed?

43:39.280 --> 43:40.691
<i>Home.</i>

43:40.800 --> 43:42.211
So am I.

43:42.280 --> 43:43.884
To your home or mine?

43:44.040 --> 43:45.451
Is that an invitation??

43:45.840 --> 43:47.808
It's whatever
you want it to be.

43:47.880 --> 43:49.086
You sound tipsy.

43:49.200 --> 43:50.361
<i>I am.</i>

43:50.480 --> 43:51.925
I just spent
the last two hours

43:52.040 --> 43:53.530
drinking Long
Island Iced Teas.

43:56.240 --> 43:57.730
What's your address?

45:04.000 --> 45:05.889
Do your parents know
you live like this?

45:06.880 --> 45:09.724
No.They
haven't visited.

45:11.360 --> 45:12.566
Are you cared for?

45:13.400 --> 45:14.561
How do you mean?

45:14.880 --> 45:18.362
Do you have a man
who cares for you?

45:18.720 --> 45:19.767
An older man.

45:19.880 --> 45:20.961
No.

45:22.760 --> 45:24.569
But you've been with
older men before?

45:25.720 --> 45:26.721
Yes.

45:27.800 --> 45:29.131
Then you know
they hurt you,

45:30.240 --> 45:31.651
and after
they hurt you,

45:32.840 --> 45:34.001
they discard you.

45:35.560 --> 45:37.164
You can't hurt me.

45:39.600 --> 45:41.170
Take your heels off.
