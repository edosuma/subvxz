00:02.603 --> 00:04.669
(theme music)

00:47.781 --> 00:49.815
(sighs)
- blazes!

00:49.950 --> 00:52.084
I told you not to fiddle
with that, henry.

00:52.086 --> 00:53.885
- I tell you, it's not fair.

00:53.921 --> 00:56.488
- What's not fair?
(clanging)

00:57.758 --> 00:59.825
- Why does he get time off?

00:59.827 --> 01:02.494
- Detective murdoch?
Well, he's just had a baby.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.430
- He didn't have a baby,
doctor ogden did.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.764
Did I get time off
when jordan was born?

01:06.801 --> 01:09.634
- Well, higgins,
you had nannies help.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.469
- I'm sure they could afford
a nanny.

01:11.505 --> 01:14.306
Look at me. I was back at work
the day after jordan was born.

01:14.375 --> 01:17.442
No time off for good old
henry higgins. No time off
at all.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.445
- But did you even ask for time
off, higgins?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.913
I'm sure the inspector would
have been glad to see
the back of you.

01:21.949 --> 01:24.983
- And why worry? Both george and
I were reared without a father.

01:25.052 --> 01:28.353
- That is not tremendously
reassuring, detective.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.523
Good lord!
- What is it?

01:31.592 --> 01:33.258
- Lads!

01:35.196 --> 01:37.595
- I-I-I am not here to hurt you,
george crabtree.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.732
I am here to surrender
to your custody.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.535
(sinister music)

01:50.144 --> 01:51.476
(door opening)

01:51.545 --> 01:54.412
(crowd catcalls)

01:57.451 --> 01:58.951
(bell ringing)

01:58.953 --> 02:00.752
- Hey! It's not last call yet.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.221
- It's not yet eight.

02:02.223 --> 02:04.355
- I'm looking for a man.

02:04.391 --> 02:05.857
- Bet you are.

02:05.860 --> 02:07.426
(laughter)

02:07.561 --> 02:09.561
- Well, you've come to
the right place, sweetheart.

02:09.696 --> 02:12.263
<i> -</i> His name is alan farrow.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.602
- Well, you're looking at him.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.316
So, what can I do for you?

02:31.385 --> 02:33.251
- You can tell me
where my son is.

02:34.521 --> 02:35.988
- I don't know what the devil
you're talking about.

02:36.123 --> 02:37.990
- Robert brackenreid.

02:37.992 --> 02:40.992
I was told
you know where he is.

02:41.061 --> 02:43.395
- Well, you were told wrong.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.530
- I'm an inspector's wife.

02:45.599 --> 02:48.934
No harm will come to me
if I shoot you.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.802
So...

02:53.807 --> 02:56.207
Where's my son?

03:01.549 --> 03:02.881
- Amelia.
- Mm-hmm?

03:03.016 --> 03:05.250
- Don't move.
- I won't.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.553
I won't! I surrender.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.823
I am sorry
for everything I've done.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.825
I am terribly, dreadfully sorry.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.694
- Where's dorothy?

03:15.696 --> 03:19.164
- She disappeared weeks ago.
I...

03:19.299 --> 03:22.634
I came home from the shops
on a Tuesday.

03:22.636 --> 03:25.503
And it, I mean, could
have been Wednesday.

03:27.507 --> 03:30.709
No,
it was definitely a Tuesday.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.844
- Could we move it along?

03:32.913 --> 03:35.113
Perhaps to the point
of all this.

03:35.115 --> 03:36.648
- My sister has vanished!

03:36.684 --> 03:40.252
She is gone! She took
all of her belongings.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.988
But it's not her you need
to worry about, it's me.

03:50.965 --> 03:52.764
- Why should I believe you?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.366
What's your game here, amelia?

03:56.770 --> 04:00.238
- I have no game, george.
I want to pay for my sins.

04:02.710 --> 04:05.944
Now, put me in jail,
I beg of you.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.880
Let me rot.
- Oblige her, lads.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.885
- Thank you. Oh, ow!
Not so rough.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.090
- Hey.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.961
Hello, ma'am.

04:23.998 --> 04:25.630
Ma'am.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.505
Pardon me, ma'am.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.109
May I?

04:39.980 --> 04:43.715
- Sir, there are plenty
of seats elsewhere.

04:45.119 --> 04:48.253
- My apologies. Are you-you
suggesting this seat's taken?

04:49.156 --> 04:51.323
- Well, no,

04:51.325 --> 04:53.625
But you needn't crowd.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.127
Wouldn't you enjoy more space?

04:56.196 --> 04:59.865
- No, if I sit somewhere else,
anyone could take the seat
beside me.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.134
Screaming child,
a fetid old man.

05:03.170 --> 05:04.602
Nobody wants that.

05:06.940 --> 05:10.609
- Well, then, I suppose
you can, if you must.

05:10.611 --> 05:11.943
- Thank you.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.679
- But mind your manners.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.550
- Why didn't you tell me
about this last night?

05:19.586 --> 05:21.018
- It was late.

05:21.055 --> 05:24.155
And she's given herself up,
effie. This is finally over.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.824
- I doubt that.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.962
She's up to something.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.098
- If she is, I can't imagine
what.

05:33.100 --> 05:36.300
I mean, what good does it do her
to go to prison?

05:36.337 --> 05:38.503
Maybe she's genuinely sorry.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.638
- Do you really believe that,
george?

05:40.708 --> 05:43.040
She's got the devil inside her.

05:43.077 --> 05:45.310
- More likely just a...
A disturbed mind.

05:45.445 --> 05:46.644
- I'll say.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.181
And she won't say
where dorothy is?

05:50.250 --> 05:52.984
- Just that she's disappeared.
(effie sighs)

05:53.020 --> 05:55.053
Effie, look, she's surrendered.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.287
This is over.

05:56.323 --> 05:57.522
(chuckles ruefully)

05:57.524 --> 05:58.990
- Our nightmare may be over,
george,

05:59.026 --> 06:00.926
But amelia's is just beginning.

06:08.268 --> 06:11.136
- I said I was sorry.
What more do you want?

06:11.271 --> 06:15.874
- So help me god,
I will prosecute you
to the full extent of the law.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.943
- What does that mean?

06:18.078 --> 06:21.078
- It means that you are going
to be very old when you get out
of prison.

06:21.115 --> 06:22.747
- Oh.

06:22.783 --> 06:23.949
- This is no game.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.550
- Oh.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.351
- Where's your sister?
- I don't know!

06:28.956 --> 06:31.756
I told you, she abandoned me.
I have no one.

06:31.792 --> 06:35.494
- Oh, maybe, if you're lucky,
you'll find a friend in jail.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.828
- Oh, I don't like you.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.663
- The feeling is mutual.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.634
- George, tell her
to stop being so horrible.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.241
Well, I was hoping
it wouldn't come to this, but...

06:50.577 --> 06:52.577
Can you please contact
this person?

06:56.183 --> 06:57.382
Thank you!

07:01.388 --> 07:02.987
- What did she give you?

07:03.023 --> 07:04.189
- A telephone number.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.657
- And you're going to call it?

07:05.659 --> 07:07.392
- Well, I ha... Effie,

07:07.527 --> 07:10.061
No matter what she did,
she has rights.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.530
Look, I completely understand
how you feel.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.632
- I don't think that you do.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.001
- Effie, she's not well.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.536
- George, I know!

07:17.538 --> 07:20.538
But she should not be out freely
wandering the streets.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.945
- Trouble in paradise?

07:26.947 --> 07:29.347
- Hopefully not for much longer.

07:29.483 --> 07:32.817
- I'd say that amelia woman
is in need of treatment,

07:32.886 --> 07:34.820
Not incarceration.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.089
- Well, try telling effie that.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.427
- Dog...

07:43.464 --> 07:45.964
Canis lupus.

07:46.033 --> 07:50.302
Cat - felis catus.

07:50.304 --> 07:54.672
Donkey - equus
africanus asinus.

07:56.276 --> 07:59.644
Radish -
raphanus sativus.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.113
You see, sweetheart,

08:02.249 --> 08:04.649
Everything in this world
has its purpose.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.518
Nothing is random.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.787
- You do realize she hasn't
the foggiest idea
what you're saying?

08:09.789 --> 08:12.323
- Not true, julia.
I am of firm belief

08:12.359 --> 08:15.326
That she does understand...
On a primal level.

08:15.362 --> 08:19.197
- Oh, you can't be serious,
william. She's a baby.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.667
Her only needs are satisfied
by touch and nourishment.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.003
Besides which,
she's asleep.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.005
- The subconscious is hard
at work.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.341
Have you learned nothing
from our friend, dr. Freud?

08:29.343 --> 08:33.477
- Oh, please! You said his ideas
were hogwash.

08:33.514 --> 08:36.147
Have you forgotten?
- Some have merit.

08:37.284 --> 08:40.351
Children drink in
their surroundings.

08:40.387 --> 08:43.487
Why should we not equip
our child

08:43.524 --> 08:45.890
With all of the tools
to excel?

08:45.893 --> 08:47.458
All of them.

08:48.495 --> 08:51.729
- Well, I'd wake her up
beforehand.

08:56.570 --> 08:57.969
- If you can, thank you.

08:58.104 --> 08:59.771
- She's out for blood,
inspector.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.239
I've never seen effie
like this before.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.708
- Well, you can't blame her. She
was kidnapped and put in a tree.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.646
- Sir, did you take time off
work when you had your boys?

09:07.781 --> 09:10.515
When you were a new father,
I mean, did you take leave
from work?

09:10.650 --> 09:12.116
- What? No.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.718
What sort of man does that?

09:13.720 --> 09:15.620
- That's my point exactly.
- Just there.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.456
- And what do fathers do,
anyway, except open their
child's bank account?

09:18.525 --> 09:21.593
Ah, although, maybe I should be
more involved.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.328
- If I was you, higgins,
I wouldn't bother.

09:23.463 --> 09:26.064
You're probably as useless
raising a child
as you are around here.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.267
What is this, this morning?!
Bloody piccadilly circus?
Put it in the tray.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.802
I'll tell you one thing.

09:30.871 --> 09:34.472
I didn't miss one day
at the station
when my lads were toddlers.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.341
Not one day!
By the way,

09:36.476 --> 09:38.476
Have either of you
seen my wife this morning?

09:38.612 --> 09:41.212
She was out the door
and gone without a word
by the time I woke up.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.647
- No, sir.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.616
- I haven't seen her, either.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.183
- Oh.

09:48.555 --> 09:51.022
No, no? Ah. Thank you.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.557
- I see.

09:52.692 --> 09:56.160
Then, could you please
tell mr. Strange
that llewellyn watts called?

09:56.229 --> 09:58.296
That's l-l-e--

09:58.431 --> 10:00.832
No, no, no, no.
It's two ls.

10:00.834 --> 10:04.769
Well, four altogether.
Ah, with a y.

10:14.514 --> 10:17.115
- You there! Give it back.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.851
I said, give it back!

10:22.923 --> 10:26.524
- Well advised to listen
to the lady. Go. Yeah.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.726
(man): Do you believe that?

10:38.538 --> 10:40.504
- That's some pistol.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.208
Army issue.

10:44.611 --> 10:46.477
Ah, sure looks it.

10:46.513 --> 10:50.081
Same one issued to me
in the boer war.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.949
- It's my husband's.

10:51.951 --> 10:53.317
- Ah!

10:54.621 --> 10:57.088
Yeah. I should have known.

10:57.223 --> 11:00.425
Of course, a woman like you
would be married.

11:00.494 --> 11:04.795
Good ones are, indeed,
always taken.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.904
- Well, he was meant to go to...

11:12.973 --> 11:14.706
Well, he was meant
to be sent to...

11:14.841 --> 11:16.107
- Serbia.
- Serbia.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.710
But the paperwork was mixed up
and they sent him to siberia.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.378
- Gentlemen.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.247
- Ah, good morning.
Inspector thomas brackenreid.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.782
How can we help you, ma'am?

11:24.918 --> 11:27.218
- You can take me to my client,
miss amelia ernst.

11:27.220 --> 11:30.321
- You're a lawyer?
I telephoned a lawyer?

11:30.323 --> 11:32.857
- Clever man. And now I am here.

11:32.992 --> 11:34.258
- And what's your name?

11:34.294 --> 11:35.794
- Edwina walmsley.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.595
And have you charged
miss ernst?

11:37.664 --> 11:38.863
- Not as of yet.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.798
- Then I would appreciate
talking to her.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.737
And you must be george crabtree?

11:45.739 --> 11:47.171
- Yes.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.539
- I see.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.078
Inspector, I would like this man
removed from any involvement
in this case.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.646
- Would you now?

11:54.648 --> 11:56.480
- Do you agree?
- I do not.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.483
- That will be duly reported.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.820
I'll not let that poor woman
be jailed without a fight.

12:03.289 --> 12:05.890
- I'll have constable crabtree
escort you to her right away.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.225
- Of course you will.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.329
Shall we?

12:14.768 --> 12:17.368
- So I took the first train.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.104
- Your son is fortunate
to have such devotion.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.174
- I appreciate you saying so.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.511
Bobby's a good boy, really.
We can fix this.

12:26.646 --> 12:28.445
- What does your husband advise?

12:29.649 --> 12:32.249
- Prefer not to talk
about him, if you don't mind.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.951
- Of course.

12:35.288 --> 12:36.654
(sighs)

12:36.723 --> 12:39.524
- He's washed his hands
of his own flesh and blood.

12:39.593 --> 12:42.660
How anyone can do that
is beyond me.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.530
But thomas...

12:45.599 --> 12:47.331
He's so stubborn.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.201
- Ah, I'm sure he's not
a bad man.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.903
He's just hurting.
You both are.

12:54.641 --> 12:56.607
- Well, he's difficult
when he wants to be.

12:57.577 --> 13:00.011
Won't budge
if it doesn't serve him.

13:01.414 --> 13:02.813
Anyway...

13:04.384 --> 13:05.750
Doesn't matter.

13:05.819 --> 13:09.020
What's important is that I find
my son before it's too late.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.021
- Any idea where he might be?

13:11.057 --> 13:14.092
- Mm, somewhere in windsor. Mm.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.093
I have a name.

13:17.163 --> 13:18.696
(clears throat)

13:20.133 --> 13:21.765
Jimmy seaton.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.435
- I know that name.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.837
Listen, I know the city.

13:26.873 --> 13:29.106
I know where
to find jimmy, too.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.709
- Thank you, mr. Appleby.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.778
- Call me charlie.

13:33.913 --> 13:35.579
- I will not.

13:35.615 --> 13:38.115
And I don't need your charity.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.984
I can take care of myself.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.919
(chuckling)
- so I've seen.

13:41.988 --> 13:45.390
But it would be wise to
have someone look out for you.

13:45.525 --> 13:48.326
And I'm not interested
in your charity either.

13:48.328 --> 13:52.530
I expect to be paid. 25 dollars
to look, 50 if I find him.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.000
- Why do you want to help me?

13:56.002 --> 13:57.801
- You're a veteran's wife.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.803
I need the money.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.275
- Sir, you have a deal.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.746
(laughs)
(clears throat)

14:15.288 --> 14:17.154
- Ooh. Oh...

14:23.763 --> 14:24.962
- Ooh.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.700
Well, I, uh...

14:28.835 --> 14:30.601
I can try the lodge
down the road.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.036
They might have something.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.571
- Oh, nonsense.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.606
I wouldn't put you
out in the cold.

14:35.642 --> 14:38.776
This will do just fine until
another room becomes available.

14:38.812 --> 14:40.645
- Ooh. Too kind, margaret.
- Hm.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.212
- Thank you.

14:44.517 --> 14:48.085
- It's late. Get a fresh
start in the morning.

14:50.857 --> 14:52.724
- I must tell you, margaret,

14:54.193 --> 14:56.994
I admire your determination.

14:57.063 --> 15:00.064
The strength it must have taken
to make this trip alone.

15:00.199 --> 15:01.666
- It's nothing.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.201
Any mother
would do the same.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.802
- I'm not so sure.

15:04.871 --> 15:07.672
You're a special woman,
margaret brackenreid.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.943
And if you were my wife, I'd
never let you out of my sight.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.478
- Well...

15:14.547 --> 15:17.415
He doesn't even know
that I've gone.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.550
He certainly
would have forbade it.
(chuckles)

15:19.552 --> 15:21.886
- So, you're a woman
who knows her own mind.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.822
- Yes.

15:24.891 --> 15:27.959
Yes, I suppose I am.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.293
Hm.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.233
- Amelia hired a lawyer?

15:35.235 --> 15:38.102
Why didn't you say so?
I could have done something.

15:38.237 --> 15:39.937
- Well, not last night
you couldn't have.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.173
I was trying
to save you undue stress.

15:42.175 --> 15:46.244
- Stop treating me like
I can't handle bad news, george!

15:47.347 --> 15:49.046
How utterly maddening.

15:55.155 --> 15:58.189
- Last time I checked, the boys
around here hang in this area.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.127
How you doing, jimmy?

16:03.262 --> 16:04.962
- Appleby. What do you want?

16:06.132 --> 16:08.232
- This is margaret.
We're looking for her son.

16:09.903 --> 16:13.004
- What the devil have I got
to do with this? I don't owe you
anything, or her.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.739
Your son got a name?

16:14.808 --> 16:17.408
- Ah, bobby brackenreid.
- Never heard of him.

16:19.446 --> 16:20.811
- Just a minute.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.415
Your cousin's
johnny meade, isn't he?

16:24.451 --> 16:26.017
- What's he got to do with this?

16:26.086 --> 16:27.384
- He's an old friend.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.087
He said I could always
count on you.

16:31.725 --> 16:34.492
- Roger shipley said he might
be taking on a new man.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.227
- Shipley, uh?

16:37.030 --> 16:39.097
- The auto shop off stanley.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.498
Last I saw roger, he was
with some strange sort.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.034
Could be your boy.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.441
Let's go, boys.

16:56.382 --> 16:58.716
(sinister music)

16:58.851 --> 17:00.318
- Do you think it's bobby?

17:00.453 --> 17:01.853
- Could be.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.721
- Thank you.

17:04.758 --> 17:08.459
It's so kind of you to help,
but why are you doing this?

17:08.461 --> 17:10.528
- I like you, margaret,

17:10.530 --> 17:12.129
You're a good woman.

17:12.198 --> 17:15.732
And I hope you find your son
and talk some sense into him.

17:15.769 --> 17:17.535
- Do you have any children?

17:17.670 --> 17:19.103
- I did.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.273
If my son were still with us,
he'd be about bobby's age.

17:23.309 --> 17:25.309
- You lost a son.

17:25.311 --> 17:27.345
I'm so sorry.

17:27.480 --> 17:31.115
- Margaret, I'm going to go see
about our friend, roger.

17:31.117 --> 17:34.017
Where I'm going
is no place for a lady.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.654
- I am going with you.
Bobby is my son!

17:36.723 --> 17:38.422
- No, you can't.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.691
I'll let you know
everything I find out.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.527
I'll see you tonight.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.500
- Ah!

17:50.336 --> 17:52.036
What's this, then?

17:52.171 --> 17:53.771
- Oh! Morning, sir.

17:53.840 --> 17:58.375
- William's been going on and on
about visual learning.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.245
He thinks susannah is the
cleverest baby in the world.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.447
Honestly, it's madness.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.652
Is everything all right?

18:08.721 --> 18:10.454
- I can't seem to find margaret.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.590
- What? My goodness.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.858
- What's happened?

18:13.860 --> 18:16.393
- Oh, I-I'll tell you
when I find her.

18:17.563 --> 18:19.530
You two have been working
together.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.698
Do you have a sense of
where she could have gone?

18:22.535 --> 18:24.001
- Uh...

18:25.738 --> 18:28.539
Well, she did take an interest
in a patient she was
tending to at the hospital.

18:28.674 --> 18:30.408
It was quite unusual.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.342
She was very secretive about it.

18:32.378 --> 18:34.278
Could that have anything
to do with it?

18:34.413 --> 18:37.014
- Possibly. Can you tell
me anything else?

18:37.083 --> 18:38.983
- Uh, the name...

18:39.052 --> 18:41.519
Donna farrow comes to mind.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.688
Do you recognize that name?

18:43.823 --> 18:45.356
- Thank you.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.559
- I'm sure she'll be all right.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.163
- Will you be requiring
my assistance, sir?

18:52.298 --> 18:54.632
- No, murdoch, this is purely
a personal matter.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.701
Right, I better be on my way.
Thank you for the tea.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.268
Good day.

19:00.740 --> 19:04.909
- Your client committed truly
reprehensible acts of violence.

19:04.978 --> 19:08.179
Abduction,
unwilful confinement.

19:08.248 --> 19:11.448
She threatened her victims at
both knife point and gun point.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.451
I swear to you,
miss walmsley,

19:13.586 --> 19:15.586
Amelia will face
severe consequences.

19:15.721 --> 19:17.188
She will never see daylight
again.

19:17.190 --> 19:20.791
- Can I just say,
I am a huge admirer of yours.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.827
Being here in this room with you
is such an honour.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.396
- I'm sor-- excuse me?

19:26.432 --> 19:29.867
- Were it not for you,
I might not be where I am today.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.003
Your courage as the first female
lawyer

19:32.138 --> 19:34.071
To graduate from
the university of toronto

19:34.140 --> 19:37.074
Inspired me
in ways you cannot fathom.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.676
- Thank you.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.344
- You're welcome.

19:40.479 --> 19:43.414
However, miss newsome,
you don't have a case.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.282
- What are you talking about?
Of course I have a case.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.485
- George crabtree lied
to my client.

19:47.487 --> 19:48.886
- Pants on fire!

19:49.021 --> 19:50.821
- Throw out everything
miss ernst said before.

19:50.957 --> 19:52.423
Amelia
recants her confession.

19:52.492 --> 19:53.957
- Are you mad?

19:53.993 --> 19:55.892
You've been spending too much
time with your client,
miss walmsley!

19:55.929 --> 19:58.429
- Whatever happened
between amelia ernst
and george crabtree

19:58.431 --> 20:00.498
Happened at
mr. Crabtree's insistence.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.500
He tricked her.
He wanted to marry her.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.502
Amelia is well within her rights

20:05.572 --> 20:08.872
To charge mr. Crabtree
with breach of promise.

20:10.076 --> 20:12.376
- The bartender told me
that you spoke to my wife.

20:12.511 --> 20:14.111
What were you talking about?

20:14.180 --> 20:16.647
- Didn't talk to her.
She went straight to farrow.

20:16.782 --> 20:19.984
- Bloody hell.
Where is that scumbag?

20:20.053 --> 20:23.387
- I don't know.
Your wife waved a gun at him.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.722
- A gun?

20:24.791 --> 20:26.924
- I saw it plain as day.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.859
- Any idea what he told her?

20:28.861 --> 20:30.861
- Sent her to windsor, I think.

20:30.863 --> 20:33.030
Something about her son.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.534
- Here, have one on me.

20:38.204 --> 20:40.370
(mysterious music)

20:44.210 --> 20:46.143
- Good evening, constable.

20:46.145 --> 20:49.013
This prisoner has requested
to speak with me.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.681
- No one told me that.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.083
- Please,

20:52.218 --> 20:54.451
I'm a lawyer.
I'll be quick.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.355
- Five minutes.

21:15.508 --> 21:18.108
- Are you supposed to be here?
- I make the rules.

21:18.177 --> 21:19.910
- Are you sure about that?

21:19.979 --> 21:22.980
George has gotten himself
into a real pickle over this.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.650
He's not who he pretends to be,
effie. You'll see.

21:26.686 --> 21:30.388
Have you any idea
the promises he's made?

21:30.390 --> 21:33.324
The lies he spewed?

21:33.459 --> 21:35.659
He lies and lies.

21:35.695 --> 21:39.196
- You're the liar, amelia.
You're not fooling anyone.

21:40.166 --> 21:41.932
- You think you're better
than me?

21:44.137 --> 21:46.470
You think
he won't leave you, too?

21:47.674 --> 21:50.273
Well, let's check
back in again in six months.

21:50.310 --> 21:51.809
Compare notes.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.411
- Sounds lovely.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.813
At least I'll know
where to find you.

21:57.383 --> 22:00.217
Now, what exactly did george
say to you that you find
so deceitful?

22:00.253 --> 22:03.821
- Oh, only that it was love
everlasting.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.690
That I was his one,
his only.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.558
The usual nonsense.

22:08.594 --> 22:10.561
- Nonsense?
- Of course.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.630
But who can blame him?

22:13.666 --> 22:16.100
He is but a man, he knows
not what he does.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.102
Men are so fickle,
aren't they?

22:18.237 --> 22:20.371
I don't need to tell you this.

22:20.440 --> 22:23.174
And let's not forget dear
emily grace,

22:25.078 --> 22:28.145
The woman george would have
married had he not failed
miserably to win her affection.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.582
- When I finish with you,

22:32.618 --> 22:35.786
No judge will let you walk free.

22:35.788 --> 22:38.522
Not after what you've done.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.326
It is only a matter of time.

22:42.395 --> 22:44.128
- Get away from her!

22:44.130 --> 22:47.330
Oh, how dare you approach
my client without
her lawyer present?

22:47.367 --> 22:50.267
You will get yourself in serious
trouble if you're not careful.

22:50.336 --> 22:52.803
- It's your client who needs
to watch herself.

22:52.938 --> 22:56.207
You should be careful, too,
if you know what's good for you.

22:57.844 --> 23:00.277
- Oh.
(mysterious music)

23:07.686 --> 23:09.319
- Bobby?

23:18.698 --> 23:21.365
- You shouldn't be out here
alone, lady.

23:21.434 --> 23:23.100
Lest that's what you want.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.768
- Just leave me alone!
Stop!

23:24.771 --> 23:28.172
Please! Stop. I'll give you
whatever you want, just stop!

23:28.174 --> 23:30.173
- I'll show you what I want.

23:30.209 --> 23:33.177
- You touch her again,
you won't walk out of here.

23:33.312 --> 23:35.379
(laughing)

23:36.349 --> 23:37.581
- Try me.

23:37.716 --> 23:39.650
(whimpers)

23:45.191 --> 23:47.991
You all right?
- Yes, yes.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.995
- From now on, you don't do
anything without me.

23:50.997 --> 23:53.730
Clear?
- Yes.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.599
- Come on.

24:04.477 --> 24:06.944
- Ah, good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.279
- I'm looking for someone who
may be staying here.

24:09.348 --> 24:11.147
Uh, the name's brackenreid,
margaret.

24:11.184 --> 24:12.549
Could I please see
your guest log?

24:13.486 --> 24:15.686
- I'm sorry, sir.

24:15.755 --> 24:19.490
- Look, there's only a handful
of respectable hotels downtown

24:19.492 --> 24:22.058
And I've checked all their guest
lists. I know she's here.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.629
Do I need to get a warrant?

24:27.333 --> 24:29.566
- Thank you.
- There you go.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.334
(sighs)

24:33.005 --> 24:34.505
- Margaret.

24:34.507 --> 24:36.173
- Thomas!
What are you doing here?

24:36.242 --> 24:38.642
- It's not what it looks like!
- Who the bloody hell are you?!

24:38.644 --> 24:40.844
- Will you please calm down?
- Who is he?

24:40.913 --> 24:43.447
- This man saved my life.

24:43.516 --> 24:44.982
He's helping me to find bobby.

24:45.117 --> 24:46.417
- You're not welcome
in any of this.

24:46.419 --> 24:48.185
- Wait a minute.

24:48.187 --> 24:51.455
Charlie knows someone
who might know where bobby is.

24:51.524 --> 24:53.524
- Well, he can tell me what
he knows and then bugger off.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.192
Well, go on, then... Speak!

24:55.194 --> 24:56.660
- You think you can shut me out,

24:56.729 --> 25:00.130
Turn your back on your son
and then come here
and tell me what to do?

25:00.166 --> 25:01.865
- I'll handle this, margaret.

25:01.868 --> 25:04.368
- You haven't and you won't.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.937
I paid charlie for his help.

25:06.973 --> 25:08.873
I'm sorry, thomas,

25:09.008 --> 25:11.408
But charlie stays.

25:15.815 --> 25:18.415
- All right.
- What on earth, william?

25:18.451 --> 25:22.286
- If I show her images
on these cards,

25:22.288 --> 25:25.689
Then tell her the word
and the sign language,

25:25.691 --> 25:29.560
Soon she'll be able to tell me
exactly what she needs

25:29.562 --> 25:31.695
Without saying a word.

25:31.830 --> 25:34.064
- She's just blinking, william.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.233
- But why not equip our child

25:36.235 --> 25:38.302
With the tools required

25:38.371 --> 25:41.572
So that there will be no limit
to what she can accomplish?

25:42.475 --> 25:44.041
(chuckles)

25:46.312 --> 25:50.047
C for circle.

25:50.116 --> 25:52.882
Circle. Uh...

25:54.253 --> 25:57.254
- I trust she will also be
brought up on weapons charges.

25:57.323 --> 26:00.390
- We will see to it that
miss ernst is indicted
on all four counts.

26:01.594 --> 26:04.595
- Well, that pleases us,
doesn't it, constable?

26:04.730 --> 26:07.430
- Yes. When is the trial?

26:08.334 --> 26:11.001
- Uh, eight weeks from today.

26:11.136 --> 26:12.268
- So far away?

26:13.772 --> 26:16.073
- In the meantime, miss ernst
and her lawyer

26:16.142 --> 26:18.942
Have requested
that she be transferred
to another facility

26:19.011 --> 26:21.011
While she awaits
prosecution.

26:21.013 --> 26:22.412
- Requested?
- Where will she go?

26:22.448 --> 26:25.215
- Ah, the woodmere correctional
institute.

26:26.185 --> 26:28.151
Well, if there's, uh,
nothing else?

26:30.089 --> 26:31.888
- Thank you, sir.
- Uh, sir.

26:32.691 --> 26:34.290
- Good day.

26:39.298 --> 26:42.365
- Well, that's good news,

26:42.401 --> 26:44.167
Isn't it?

26:44.203 --> 26:46.036
- Yes, it is.

26:48.441 --> 26:50.975
- You lied to me.
- Margaret.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.909
- He's our son, thomas!

26:52.945 --> 26:56.647
You could have gone after him,
but instead decided
he wasn't worth finding.

26:58.451 --> 27:02.052
- Have you considered that bobby
would lead a better life
if we don't bring him back?

27:02.187 --> 27:04.321
He'll go to prison, margaret.

27:05.324 --> 27:06.923
- You are his father.

27:06.959 --> 27:09.826
Does that honestly escape you?

27:16.068 --> 27:17.935
- I ought to put you
through that window.

27:17.937 --> 27:21.071
- Sorry if I crossed any lines,
but, man to man,
nothing happened.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.007
We're not that different,
you and I.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.542
- Oh, yes, we are.

27:25.611 --> 27:28.212
For starters, you wouldn't
catch me in a hotel room
with another man's wife.

27:28.347 --> 27:30.881
- We're both military men.
Both made it home.

27:30.950 --> 27:34.284
Both fathers of sons.
- That doesn't make us the same.

27:34.286 --> 27:35.819
- She loves your boy.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.354
And so do you.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.356
And, lucky for you, you still
have a chance with bobby.

27:39.358 --> 27:42.426
I won't see my boy again, ever.

27:42.561 --> 27:43.760
- Why's that?

27:45.064 --> 27:46.796
- That's a story for another
day, if that's all right.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.032
- Fine.

27:48.167 --> 27:51.235
But don't think you're gonna
get away with this so easily.

27:51.237 --> 27:53.036
Lucky for you,
she's in the other room.

27:53.039 --> 27:55.072
- You ought to step it up,
brother.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.173
You're but a stone's throw away
from losing your wife.

27:57.209 --> 27:58.842
- Thomas!

28:02.381 --> 28:05.782
- Right. I hate
to break this up,

28:07.519 --> 28:10.053
But I've got to go
and see someone from
the local constabulary.

28:10.122 --> 28:11.722
- Now?
- An old mate of mine.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.857
He might know something
about bobby.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.197
(groaning)

28:26.205 --> 28:28.272
(sinister music)

28:39.485 --> 28:41.285
- Yeah, I have seen him
around here.

28:41.420 --> 28:42.752
- Where?

28:42.788 --> 28:44.488
- I don't know
where he could be.

28:44.490 --> 28:45.889
- Any thoughts?

28:46.024 --> 28:49.559
- Well, he was seen with a local
troublemaker, roger shipley.

28:50.596 --> 28:52.563
- Are you familiar
with this shipley lad?

28:52.698 --> 28:54.898
- Yeah, he's known around here.

28:54.934 --> 28:56.966
A nasty record.

28:57.002 --> 28:59.035
Your bobby keeps up with him,

28:59.037 --> 29:00.570
Then he's headed down
a dark path.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.306
Ah?

29:03.375 --> 29:05.442
- What's all this?

29:05.577 --> 29:07.277
- Oh, can you excuse us?

29:08.580 --> 29:10.213
You followed me?

29:11.717 --> 29:13.650
Bobby's no better off
than he ever was.

29:13.652 --> 29:16.119
He's mixed up
with the wrong crowd.

29:16.122 --> 29:19.056
Margaret, let's go home.
He doesn't want to be found.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.258
We have to let him go.
You know that.

29:21.393 --> 29:25.094
- I won't go home with you
without him.

29:27.666 --> 29:30.200
Why don't you just go back
to your drink?

29:34.740 --> 29:37.207
- Someone will find you soon.

29:37.342 --> 29:39.142
Promise.

29:39.945 --> 29:41.478
(policemen groaning)

29:41.613 --> 29:44.214
Hurts, doesn't it?

29:46.218 --> 29:48.451
Oh! Thank you.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.223
(dramatic music)

29:57.062 --> 29:59.363
- Sorry to spoil your dinner,
george crabtree,

29:59.498 --> 30:01.398
But we have a date!

30:03.903 --> 30:05.969
Don't move!

30:05.971 --> 30:07.838
- Can I take the sauce
off the stove?

30:07.973 --> 30:09.773
Dangerous to leave a pan
over heat.

30:09.775 --> 30:11.575
- Yeah, hurry up.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.110
- Don't try anything.

30:16.114 --> 30:18.715
- When effie comes back

30:18.851 --> 30:23.053
For one of her sinful visits...

30:23.122 --> 30:26.522
She'll have the pleasure of
knowing what we have in store

30:26.559 --> 30:31.961
For mr. George crabtree.

30:33.132 --> 30:34.964
- Here...
(crying)

30:35.934 --> 30:38.534
- Margaret,
I know where bobby is.

30:39.738 --> 30:41.405
- You do?

30:41.540 --> 30:44.141
- When I left this afternoon,
I went to a place
off stanley street,

30:44.276 --> 30:46.943
A drinking den
in an auto repair shop.

30:47.079 --> 30:50.013
I think bobby
could be staying there
with roger and his cohorts.

30:51.884 --> 30:53.083
- You found bobby?

30:53.085 --> 30:54.351
- No, I said he might be there.

30:54.486 --> 30:57.754
Now, I can take you there now,
if you-- if you're ready.

30:59.458 --> 31:02.492
- Oh, I need to find thomas.

31:02.561 --> 31:03.927
- No...

31:05.030 --> 31:06.830
If your son sees your husband,
he'll run.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.699
First of all, he's a cop.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.703
You know, he might be
a nice guy, but he has a temper.

31:13.739 --> 31:14.971
- Mm.

31:15.007 --> 31:17.607
- Bobby knows he's been--
he's given up on him.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.979
- I still need to tell him.

31:21.981 --> 31:24.113
- You and me, we're not cops.

31:24.149 --> 31:26.249
You're his mother.

31:26.252 --> 31:28.852
If anyone can make him
show himself, it's you.

31:30.823 --> 31:32.322
- I don't know.

31:32.457 --> 31:35.858
- Once you talk to him,
you can decide
what you want to do with him.

31:37.129 --> 31:39.329
Look, I can't make him
come home, and neither can you,

31:39.398 --> 31:41.732
But I can give you
the chance you're looking for.

31:43.002 --> 31:44.734
Do you trust me?

31:48.007 --> 31:50.073
- I'll go with you.

31:50.075 --> 31:52.142
I just need you
to give me one moment.

31:52.211 --> 31:53.744
- Okay.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.752
(soft music)

32:15.567 --> 32:17.233
Let's go, margaret.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.836
Let's go find your son.
(margaret exclaims)

32:35.187 --> 32:38.121
- Who in their right mind
would go to a poetry reading?

32:39.591 --> 32:42.859
- You could expand your mind.
That might be worth the bother.

32:42.995 --> 32:44.728
- Have you seen george?

32:44.730 --> 32:46.530
- I've not seen him,
but I've only just arrived.

32:46.665 --> 32:48.065
- Bit late, isn't it?

32:48.200 --> 32:50.333
- Well, I just dropped off
jordan with ruth.

32:50.336 --> 32:52.736
Thought I needed a break.
Think I've deserved it.

32:53.839 --> 32:56.072
Fatherhood can be hard work.

32:56.208 --> 32:58.041
- Something's not right
about amelia's lawyer.

32:58.176 --> 33:00.610
- You mean past the fact
that she's amelia's lawyer?

33:01.813 --> 33:03.413
- I'm going to go
and look for george.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.148
- Can I be of assistance?

33:05.150 --> 33:08.084
- If you could find out
anything about miss walmsley,
I'd be most grateful.

33:08.220 --> 33:09.886
- Well, ah, me?

33:10.022 --> 33:12.622
- Just... Stay alert, henry.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.157
- Hm.

33:19.631 --> 33:20.964
George?

33:21.099 --> 33:23.099
(suspenseful music)

33:37.116 --> 33:39.850
<i> (amelia): George crabtree</i>
<i> is in good hands.</i>

33:39.852 --> 33:44.187
<i>However, we will not insult you</i>
<i> with assurances he will be</i>
<i> returned in one piece.</i>

33:44.322 --> 33:47.190
<i> And that depends</i>
<i> entirely on you.</i>

33:47.325 --> 33:50.393
<i> Livery stable number 64.</i>
<i> Come alone.</i>

33:52.330 --> 33:54.064
(panting)

33:54.066 --> 33:57.834
- Operator! Operator,
station house four, please.

34:02.341 --> 34:04.073
- Amelia's crazy.

34:04.109 --> 34:06.476
You're going down
a very dangerous road here.

34:06.545 --> 34:09.679
- Sorry, but you don't know
what you're talking about.

34:09.715 --> 34:12.015
And you're wrong about amelia.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.616
- No. I'm not.

34:13.685 --> 34:16.419
Look, just let me go,
we can both get out of here.

34:16.422 --> 34:19.189
(scoffs)
I swear you'll thank me later.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.925
- No one's going anywhere
tonight, george crabtree.

34:23.662 --> 34:25.562
- Dorothy?

34:25.564 --> 34:27.196
Where's amelia?

34:28.233 --> 34:29.633
- She's dead.

34:29.768 --> 34:32.002
- What are you talking about?

34:32.004 --> 34:34.037
Let me speak to her.

34:34.039 --> 34:36.039
- No, don't you get it,
you fool?

34:36.174 --> 34:38.374
Amelia's been gone for weeks.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.785
It was the worst thing
I ever saw.

34:48.787 --> 34:50.320
- Why should I believe you?

34:50.389 --> 34:51.988
Why would I believe
anything you said?

34:52.024 --> 34:53.689
- Please show him.

34:57.329 --> 34:58.828
Go.

35:04.002 --> 35:06.102
(macabre music)

35:11.543 --> 35:13.276
- I'm so sorry.
(grunts)

35:16.548 --> 35:17.947
Well...

35:18.016 --> 35:19.882
You know what they say,

35:19.918 --> 35:22.219
What's good for the gander
is good for the goose.

35:22.221 --> 35:24.387
- I don't think
that's the saying.

35:25.324 --> 35:27.757
- Oh, yeah? Well,
it's close enough

35:29.128 --> 35:30.460
- Come on.

35:39.505 --> 35:41.104
Hm...

35:44.709 --> 35:46.742
Here you go.

35:46.778 --> 35:49.078
(margaret sighs)
(glass clanking)

35:52.985 --> 35:55.251
- Oi. Whew.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.253
(grunts)

35:58.723 --> 36:00.523
- Go on.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.193
- Bobby...

36:06.665 --> 36:08.999
I just want to talk.

36:11.003 --> 36:14.471
You needn't come home,
if that isn't what you want.

36:14.606 --> 36:18.307
I just need to know that
you're all right.

36:19.111 --> 36:20.744
That's all.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.618
Maybe we should go.

36:28.753 --> 36:30.620
He's not here.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.423
- You sure about that?

36:36.962 --> 36:39.095
(suspenseful music)

36:39.164 --> 36:41.564
- Mother, please, just go home.

36:41.567 --> 36:43.366
- I will not.

36:43.501 --> 36:44.634
Not without you.

36:44.670 --> 36:46.502
- Not so fast!

36:47.806 --> 36:51.107
- What-what-what's going on?

36:51.176 --> 36:55.045
- I'm giving you
what you wanted,
a chance to talk to your son.

36:55.047 --> 36:57.980
And a kindness
I never got.

36:59.451 --> 37:01.517
At least you get to say goodbye.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.020
- Ah!
(indistinct crowd murmuring)

37:06.992 --> 37:08.524
- Oh, I love you.

37:08.560 --> 37:11.927
(chuckling)
- not as much as I love you.

37:11.964 --> 37:13.396
- Mm.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.401
- Mm...

37:21.740 --> 37:23.473
- Amelia, wait, wait! Wait!

37:23.542 --> 37:25.941
I-I-I haven't written
any of your story yet!

37:25.978 --> 37:27.277
There's so much left to write--

37:27.279 --> 37:30.413
- I'm not amelia, you idiot.

37:30.482 --> 37:32.749
And I don't believe
in happy endings.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.350
- Dorothy, don't, don't!
- George!

37:34.419 --> 37:36.353
- Don't!
- George!

37:37.589 --> 37:40.022
- Oh, why'd you have to go
and do that?

37:40.058 --> 37:42.325
We were just having fun,
miss newsome.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.393
(grunting)

37:47.065 --> 37:48.632
- I knew it was you!

37:48.767 --> 37:52.435
I should have known
when you spoke of emily grace!

37:52.471 --> 37:54.237
You're insane, dorothy!

37:54.372 --> 37:55.639
- George!
(gun cocks)

37:55.774 --> 37:58.508
- Oh, I knew it was you!
- No, you didn't!

37:58.510 --> 38:00.843
- You won't get away with this!
- Stop right there!
You're under arrest!

38:00.912 --> 38:02.712
- ...Won't die alone after all!

38:02.847 --> 38:04.180
George is probably
with her right now.

38:04.316 --> 38:05.715
- Shut up!

38:05.850 --> 38:08.984
- I'm just trying to help,
so you better let go
if you want him to live.

38:10.188 --> 38:11.654
Let him swing, effie!

38:11.657 --> 38:14.190
- George! Say something.
Say something, please!

38:14.259 --> 38:17.126
Please, I won't forgive myself
if you die like this!

38:18.263 --> 38:20.797
Please, please!
I love you, george crabtree.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.799
- He's not worth it, effie.

38:22.801 --> 38:25.535
- I love you.
I love you, george crabtree.

38:25.537 --> 38:26.870
- George, hold on!

38:27.005 --> 38:28.371
(grunts)

38:29.308 --> 38:30.774
- Uh...
- George?

38:30.776 --> 38:32.742
(gasping)

38:32.877 --> 38:35.078
- Effie?
Oh! Not too tight!

38:40.152 --> 38:41.484
(grunts)

38:42.420 --> 38:44.554
- How could you?

38:44.623 --> 38:45.622
- Drop the gun!

38:45.757 --> 38:47.090
- Oh, good. You're here.

38:47.225 --> 38:49.025
I wasn't sure you had it in you.

38:49.027 --> 38:51.027
- I said drop it.
- Why should I?

38:51.162 --> 38:53.162
My life is all but
worthless now.

38:53.198 --> 38:54.830
Your son killed my only son.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.065
- Your son?

38:56.134 --> 38:57.767
- Christopher was doing
legitimate time.

38:57.836 --> 39:01.404
Almost up for parole when bobby
beat him to death in prison.

39:01.406 --> 39:03.973
- Your son attacked me! He would
have killed me if I--
- shut it!

39:04.009 --> 39:06.041
- You were lying to me
this whole time?

39:06.078 --> 39:09.445
- I'm sorry, margaret.
You are a remarkable woman.

39:09.481 --> 39:12.649
I didn't mean to deceive you,
but your boy killed my boy.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.383
You understand?

39:15.354 --> 39:17.086
- Robert brackenreid.

39:18.323 --> 39:21.725
- Bobby was just defending
himself. Please, charlie!

39:21.860 --> 39:23.660
What's the use
of two dead boys?!

39:23.795 --> 39:25.061
- Shut your mouth!

39:25.196 --> 39:27.997
- I'm warning you!
Drop the gun, or I'll shoot!

39:30.769 --> 39:32.001
- No!

39:34.439 --> 39:36.339
- Margaret!
- Mother!

39:36.474 --> 39:38.274
- Go and get help.

39:38.343 --> 39:40.343
Bobby, go and get a doctor,
move it!

39:40.345 --> 39:42.545
And you better bloody come back!

39:42.547 --> 39:44.881
Press this on.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.215
(suspenseful music)

39:46.284 --> 39:47.950
- Oh, thomas.
(panting)

39:47.986 --> 39:49.552
- I'm so sorry.

39:54.659 --> 39:56.426
- You're lucky she's alive.

39:56.561 --> 39:58.027
- I didn't mean her harm.

39:58.163 --> 39:59.562
- I'm sorry about your son.

39:59.697 --> 40:02.264
- Yeah. That doesn't
bring him back.

40:03.368 --> 40:06.436
- I know, but neither would
killing my boy.

40:07.239 --> 40:08.771
Take him away, lads.

40:08.840 --> 40:11.273
- Done. Here.

40:16.481 --> 40:18.248
- You two aren't going to stop
chasing me, are you?

40:18.383 --> 40:20.049
- You're our son.

40:20.085 --> 40:22.118
I would chase you
to the ends of the earth.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.654
- You don't have to.
- I don't have a choice.

40:24.789 --> 40:26.923
- It's time you came home.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.258
I'll do what I can.

40:28.260 --> 40:29.592
- Go home to jail?

40:29.594 --> 40:31.461
- The first one was an accident.

40:31.463 --> 40:33.263
The second one was
self-defence.

40:33.398 --> 40:35.130
Listen to me, son.

40:35.167 --> 40:38.067
If you keep running,
you'll always be looking
over your shoulder.

40:39.003 --> 40:40.336
- Please, bobby.

40:40.472 --> 40:42.272
I can't lose you.

40:44.676 --> 40:46.008
- All right.

40:49.114 --> 40:52.815
Just don't do anything
like that again.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.284
Please.

40:54.419 --> 40:55.885
- Good boy.

41:03.562 --> 41:05.027
- Milo.

41:06.164 --> 41:08.297
- Llewellyn. What are
you doing here?

41:08.333 --> 41:11.301
- Well, I heard this was
the place

41:11.436 --> 41:14.537
To see the milo strange.

41:14.672 --> 41:16.973
Thought I could use
some poetry.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.374
- Hm.

41:18.376 --> 41:19.909
- Something wrong?

41:19.945 --> 41:23.446
- No, no. I just wasn't
expecting you.

41:23.581 --> 41:26.682
- Well, well, seeing
as you didn't invite me.

41:32.057 --> 41:34.390
But you did invite someone else?

41:34.526 --> 41:36.926
- Just a new admirer.
- I see.

41:36.928 --> 41:38.695
- I have many.

41:38.697 --> 41:41.697
- I've...
I have no doubt you do.

41:43.401 --> 41:46.869
- I'm sorry, llewellyn.
I thought I was clear.

41:49.474 --> 41:51.140
I will call on you.

41:51.943 --> 41:54.243
- Yes, of course, certainly.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.913
(sad music)

42:23.575 --> 42:26.576
- Dorothy will be coming
for you. Watch out.

42:27.412 --> 42:29.244
- Will she?

42:29.281 --> 42:32.448
- She loves me
and she will be back.

42:32.450 --> 42:35.051
- I don't think so,
miss walmsley.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.386
She was using you.

42:36.521 --> 42:37.987
- She loves me, you fool!

42:37.989 --> 42:39.789
You'll see!

42:39.924 --> 42:41.791
You'll see!!

42:46.331 --> 42:48.464
- You know what, george?

42:48.466 --> 42:50.800
I think it's time
we get married.

42:50.802 --> 42:51.800
- Effie?

42:51.836 --> 42:54.003
- Dorothy will come for us,
married or not.

42:54.039 --> 42:56.138
I think we should face her
together.

42:57.141 --> 42:58.808
What do you say?

43:00.979 --> 43:02.878
- I say yes.

43:06.451 --> 43:08.084
(joyful music)

43:08.153 --> 43:10.086
(baby babbling)

43:25.971 --> 43:28.771
- Watching these all day?

43:28.807 --> 43:31.774
I can't see how any good
can come of this.

43:36.581 --> 43:39.582
