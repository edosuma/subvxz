<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:32.156 --> 00:34.159
Bah!

00:34.159 --> 00:36.253
You're only gonna be
gone a few weeks.

00:36.245 --> 00:37.667
Why'd you pack the whole house?

00:37.663 --> 00:40.507
When you go to Laos, you have
to be prepared for anything.

00:40.499 --> 00:43.753
Fancy dinner party,
fishing on the Yangtow River,

00:43.752 --> 00:45.880
surprise lengthy hospital stay.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.052
Besides, I couldn't decide
what sandals to bring.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.517
You're in for one
leech-infested vacation, lady.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.432
Closed-toe all the way.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.428
Kahn, while we're gone,

00:53.428 --> 00:54.429
there's going to be a lot to do.

00:54.596 --> 00:55.939
You have to remember

00:55.931 --> 00:59.526
to turn off the sprinklers
every day at 6:00 p.m.,

00:59.518 --> 01:03.398
pay the gas bill online, and
refill your prescription.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.397
Fine, okay.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.071
Stop talking and leave already.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.364
I can't wait
to make my underwear

01:08.360 --> 01:10.328
my only-wear.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.492
Hello, Minh.

01:11.488 --> 01:12.956
Are you off on your big trip?

01:12.948 --> 01:16.168
Uh, I have a favor to ask.

01:16.159 --> 01:19.504
Kahn will be home alone
for the first time in years.

01:19.496 --> 01:22.500
Maybe Hank could check on him?

01:22.499 --> 01:24.422
Make sure he's all right.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.802
Don't you worry, Minh.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.512
I will have Hank check on Kahn.

01:27.504 --> 01:30.383
I know how hard it is
for Kahn to make friends.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.759
That's not what I said.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.180
Well, it's what you meant.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.349
Hurry up and get in cab

01:35.345 --> 01:37.188
before redneck neighbors
steal your luggage

01:37.180 --> 01:39.148
and take it to pawn shop.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.776
<i>All right, everyone.</i>

01:41.768 --> 01:44.487
Grillstravaganza
is in two weeks.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.982
Now, as you know, this
is the only time of year

01:46.982 --> 01:49.405
I ask you to take
your job seriously.

01:49.568 --> 01:52.071
Last year,
Thatherton cooked our chestnuts

01:52.070 --> 01:54.448
like a Parisian gypsy.

02:08.669 --> 02:11.799
We got to outsell Thatherton
this year, people.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.015
Ideas?

02:13.008 --> 02:15.477
How about we wrap a guy
in raw meat

02:15.469 --> 02:17.392
and put him on the grill?

02:17.387 --> 02:18.434
Just for a little while.

02:18.597 --> 02:19.723
How about we give away a monkey?

02:19.723 --> 02:21.521
A monkey with a hat.

02:21.516 --> 02:23.564
Well, we're not doing
a bikini car wash

02:23.560 --> 02:26.484
'cause I'm the only one
that ends up in a bikini.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.448
Oh, all right, I'll do it.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.735
Okay, we got the entertainment
taken care of. Good.

02:30.734 --> 02:33.078
Now, who's on promotions?

02:33.070 --> 02:34.788
Uh, no offense,
Mr. Strickland,

02:34.780 --> 02:38.410
but what does any of that have
to do with selling grills?

02:38.408 --> 02:41.503
Once again you have attempted
to cut through the crap.

02:41.495 --> 02:44.294
Now, let's see
if you can actually do it.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.508
But if you can't,
we're doing it my way,

02:46.500 --> 02:47.501
and the crap wins.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.503
I will give my all for you

02:49.503 --> 02:51.221
and propane.

02:51.213 --> 02:54.513
And to keep Donna's clothes on.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.510
<i>One of these boxes</i>

02:56.510 --> 02:59.229
has all of my old
Halloween costumes in it.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.689
Hold on a second.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.479
What have we here?

03:03.517 --> 03:06.521
Your dad used to like music?

03:06.520 --> 03:10.241
Dude, the computer this
goes in must be huge.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.484
Comedy?

03:11.483 --> 03:13.485
Joseph,

03:13.485 --> 03:15.954
to the turntable.

03:15.946 --> 03:20.167
As usual, Grillstravaganza
is all on my shoulders.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.206
And my shoulders
are drawing a blank.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.830
Why don't you change
the name to Grill?

03:24.830 --> 03:27.424
It's the stravaganza
part that's killing you.

03:27.416 --> 03:28.759
You guys want to head over

03:28.750 --> 03:30.502
to Mega Lo Mart with me?

03:30.502 --> 03:32.220
Maybe I'll get some ideas.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.464
I hear keys jingling.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.303
I bet you're going
somewhere fun.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.892
Why don't you
take Kahn with you?

03:39.177 --> 03:40.724
Good one.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.473
Uh, what?

03:42.472 --> 03:43.940
Why would I invite Kahn?

03:43.932 --> 03:46.026
Because I told Minh
you would spend time with him

03:46.017 --> 03:47.519
while she's out of town.

03:47.519 --> 03:50.944
And when I say no, Minh pretends
she doesn't speak English.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.486
All right, fine.

03:52.482 --> 03:53.859
I'll ask Kahn.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.156
Come on, guys.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.495
Welp, I'm out.

03:56.486 --> 03:59.205
I'm dang ol' not gonna
make it after all, man.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.199
<i>No hablo ingles, Hank.</i>

04:04.286 --> 04:06.505
My dad never laughs at anything,

04:06.496 --> 04:08.419
so this has got to be good.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.092
Hey, Johnson!

04:11.084 --> 04:13.303
Oh, you doesn't have to call me Johnson.

04:13.295 --> 04:15.844
My name is
Raymond J. Johnson Jr.

04:15.839 --> 04:19.012
Now, you can call me Ray
or you can call me Jay

04:19.009 --> 04:20.807
or you can call me R.J.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.520
or you can call me R.J.J.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.516
or you can call me R.J.J. Jr.,

04:25.515 --> 04:27.768
but you doesn't have
to call me Johnson.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.395
I don't get it.

04:30.395 --> 04:31.487
What are they laughing at?

04:31.480 --> 04:33.448
And who's he talking to?

04:33.607 --> 04:34.824
Is he talking to us?

04:34.816 --> 04:35.863
I'd like to hear more

04:35.859 --> 04:38.032
from the guy
who said, "Hey, Johnson."

04:38.028 --> 04:40.406
Maybe we have to play
it at a faster speed.

04:43.575 --> 04:46.795
Better, but still not funny.

04:50.457 --> 04:53.301
Well, the weather's
been nice, huh?

04:53.293 --> 04:55.796
Weather too dry
for my supple skin.

05:00.383 --> 05:04.433
So, uh, you're a
systems analyst, huh?

05:04.429 --> 05:07.308
That must be, uh, interesting.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.900
Yeah, occasionally
I get to consult

05:08.892 --> 05:11.145
for a company
with intelligent leadership,

05:11.144 --> 05:15.490
like Anderson Automotive, GCP,
Vogner, Southwest Paper...

05:15.482 --> 05:17.780
You consulted for Vogner?

05:17.776 --> 05:19.494
<i>The</i> Vogner Grills?

05:19.486 --> 05:21.079
Oh, Vogner make
a quality product.

05:21.071 --> 05:24.416
No one designs a better
flanged hood and side firebox

05:24.407 --> 05:27.081
for that special flavor
rednecks like.

05:27.077 --> 05:30.502
Now, this may sound weird,
but can you just talk?

05:30.497 --> 05:31.874
I want to listen to this.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.875
You know what I always wonder?

05:33.875 --> 05:35.969
Why no company has ever
souped up a grill--

05:35.961 --> 05:39.181
Made it a total
entertainment centerpiece.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.846
I have been saying that
for years.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.470
Think of all the peripheral
devices you could add:

05:44.636 --> 05:46.764
a minibar, a knife sharpener.

05:46.763 --> 05:50.393
Yeah, flat-screen TV,
face mister.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.520
Buck Strickland wanted
something exciting

05:52.519 --> 05:54.362
for the Grillstravaganza.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.777
Kahn, I want to
build that grill.

05:56.773 --> 05:57.945
Will you help me?

05:57.941 --> 05:59.113
I will, Hank Hill.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.453
I must.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.117
We call it
The Commander-in-Beef.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.495
It's the Swiss Army knife
of grills,

06:09.494 --> 06:10.495
but made by a country

06:10.495 --> 06:12.873
that's not afraid
to fight a war.

06:13.957 --> 06:17.507
Welcome to Strickland Propane.

06:17.502 --> 06:21.177
Well, what do you say
we get started, partner?

06:26.887 --> 06:28.514
Check it out, Hank.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.514
Miter saw.

06:29.514 --> 06:31.733
Perfect for cutting
bread. And look.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.148
We could add a snow cone
machine for the kids.

06:34.144 --> 06:37.694
Kahn, we stand
at the threshold of greatness.

06:37.689 --> 06:40.317
Oh, I got to go pick up
a prescription.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.740
I'll catch up with you
at the corn dog cart.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.741
Uh-oh, she's dealing
with an argumentative senior.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.243
I don't want it in a pill.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.495
I want it in an ointment.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.496
Oh, we'll be here all day.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.498
Maybe I <i>don't</i> need the medicine.

06:55.498 --> 06:56.750
I'm not sick.

06:56.750 --> 07:00.380
Minh only makes me take
them to even out my moods.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.756
Listen, if you're not sick,
don't worry about it.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.225
Wives have turned us
into pill-popping,

07:05.216 --> 07:08.311
baby-wearing,
teeth-whitening sissies.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.223
Yeah, you right.

07:11.222 --> 07:12.519
I think I'll
self-medicate

07:12.515 --> 07:16.395
with 50,000 BTUs of
ass-kicking hellfire.

07:21.399 --> 07:25.825
Mom, I found this comedy
album in the closet.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.448
Oh, Ray J. Johnson Jr.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.792
"You can call me this
and you can..."

07:32.202 --> 07:34.421
He's the man
who taught America to laugh.

07:34.412 --> 07:38.007
Well, if there was a Mr. 1976,
it was certainly him.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.468
He's the one who got us
through the second gas crisis.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.221
Well, did it come with a
booklet that you follow along?

07:43.213 --> 07:45.307
'Cause what's here is not funny.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.299
You're wrong.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.472
It is funny,
and let me tell you why.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.603
You can't explain comedy.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.067
Oh, hey, Kahn.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.365
Wow, you sure got
an early start here.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.910
I stayed up all night and
worked out every last detail.

08:08.905 --> 08:12.079
Entire project is designed
and diagrammed in my head.

08:12.075 --> 08:16.080
Well, just point me where I need
to be and put a tool in my hand.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.080
Welder.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.003
Over there.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.515
Boy, I'm telling you,
it's like somebody took Kahn

08:27.507 --> 08:30.511
and replaced him
with an actual human being.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.932
You're talking about Kahn?

08:31.928 --> 08:33.895
Our neighbor Kahn?

08:33.888 --> 08:36.732
Yes, he is a completely
different person,

08:36.725 --> 08:39.399
and in one day,
my liking of him went up

08:39.394 --> 08:41.943
from not very much to somewhat.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.487
Tell you what, man, talkin' 'bout one
dang ol' day ain't gonna make up

08:44.482 --> 08:47.952
for dang ol' seven dan-
dang ol' years, man.

08:47.944 --> 08:50.493
Well, maybe we never took
the time to get to know him.

08:50.488 --> 08:54.914
He's so outgoing and funny
and has such energy and passion.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.207
So how are his hands?

08:58.496 --> 09:01.090
When you're walking
down the street holding hands,

09:01.082 --> 09:02.083
are they soft?

09:02.083 --> 09:03.084
Enough talking.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.882
I want to meet the new Kahn.

09:19.517 --> 09:23.112
Hank, you said
Kahn had energy, but wow.

09:23.104 --> 09:26.483
He's accomplished more in ten
seconds than I have in a year.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.201
Hello, neighbors,
watch your step,

09:28.193 --> 09:29.945
but as always,
it's good to see you,

09:29.944 --> 09:31.287
and I just baked
delicious cookies

09:31.279 --> 09:33.498
that should be cooled off
in 35 seconds.

09:33.490 --> 09:37.165
Kahn, that self-
portrait is beautiful.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.413
Oh, last night I took
painting class on Internet

09:39.412 --> 09:41.380
and it teach the importance
of color and depth.

09:41.372 --> 09:42.999
And hey, who wants
piping hot delicious cookies?

09:47.170 --> 09:48.968
Is this our grill?

09:48.963 --> 09:51.011
Our new grill.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.726
Yeah, yeah,
new ideas hit me all the time.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.265
It now has every accoutrement

09:55.261 --> 09:57.059
a tailgating football junkie
could ever desire.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.524
Say, did you know Hank
is an anagram for Kahn?

09:59.516 --> 10:01.689
H-A-N-K, K-A-H-N.

10:01.684 --> 10:04.358
Looks like we destined
to be best friends, right?

10:07.148 --> 10:11.324
Wow, uh, you know, this grill--
It, it looks pretty elaborate.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.491
We only have a week.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.034
We can finish it no problem

10:14.030 --> 10:16.124
'cause I compute the amount
of work it will take

10:16.116 --> 10:18.494
and the amount of time
we have before the sale

10:18.493 --> 10:20.495
and I concluded that
we will finish it

10:20.495 --> 10:21.838
with five hours, three minutes,

10:21.830 --> 10:23.958
and eight seconds to spare.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.460
Yeah, that sounds right to me.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.435
That's some nice humming
there, Kahn,

10:35.593 --> 10:38.016
but I really need you to focus.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.891
Who you think tastes better
deep-fried-- Gribble?

10:40.890 --> 10:42.938
No, Dauterive.

10:42.934 --> 10:43.981
He'd be so delicious.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.399
We seal in all his juices...

10:45.395 --> 10:47.739
You know, I think it would be
easier to work with you

10:47.730 --> 10:49.448
if I had another beer.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.491
Hey, ol' top.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.411
I just thought I'd check in
on my two favorite laborers.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.167
Hot damn,

10:59.159 --> 11:00.752
that's a fine-
looking grill.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.872
You think this handsome guy do
anything less than perfect?

11:03.872 --> 11:06.751
But you know...

11:06.749 --> 11:07.966
it's coming to me.

11:07.959 --> 11:10.508
Stay with me
'cause it's going to kick you

11:10.503 --> 11:11.925
in the hillbilly ass.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.049
Automated flavor sensors
here and here,

11:14.048 --> 11:16.050
remote control operated trays,

11:16.050 --> 11:18.519
and mechanical arms
on either side,

11:18.511 --> 11:20.934
like a giant grill robot.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.022
Robot?

11:22.015 --> 11:23.642
How the heck are we going
to pull that off?

11:23.641 --> 11:25.143
It's crazy easy.

11:25.143 --> 11:27.896
We attach a couple motherboards,
some microprocessors,

11:27.896 --> 11:28.943
a few transistors...
Love it.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.781
Don't understand it,
but I love it.

11:30.773 --> 11:31.865
Get to work.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.702
Thatherton and I made a bet
Yakuza-style.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.413
I could lose a pinky.

11:41.284 --> 11:42.456
Hey, Johnson.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.713
Oh, you doesn't
have to call me Johnson.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.958
My name is Raymond J. Johnson Jr.

11:47.957 --> 11:51.336
Okay, see, you're laughing,
but I don't know why.

11:51.336 --> 11:54.465
Because you doesn't have
to call him Johnson.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.429
Hey, man, look, you see,

11:56.424 --> 11:58.142
he get-gets annoyed
because a man--

11:58.134 --> 12:00.512
The man only got his
dang ol' name, man, so call--

12:00.511 --> 12:02.980
You can call him Johnny,
don't have to call him Sonny,

12:02.972 --> 12:04.815
dang ol', dang,
dang ol' Junie, too, man.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.400
And then what?

12:06.392 --> 12:07.644
What more would you need?

12:11.356 --> 12:13.859
Oh...

12:22.492 --> 12:24.165
Kahn's not here?

12:24.160 --> 12:27.209
We also noticed
and discussed it at length.

12:27.205 --> 12:28.707
Dang it, he promised Strickland

12:28.706 --> 12:30.754
some kind of
robot super-grill,

12:30.750 --> 12:32.502
and I can't get him to focus.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.379
That Kahn's a ball of energy.

12:34.379 --> 12:35.847
Last night we popped some corn

12:35.838 --> 12:38.512
and solved
the JFK assassination.

12:38.508 --> 12:39.509
<i>And</i> Lincoln.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.011
We're halfway through McKinley.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.011
The other night

12:42.011 --> 12:44.184
he ghost-wrote
my autobiography.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.523
I came out great.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.813
I don't understand
what's gotten into Kahn.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.562
Only thing I can see that's
changed is that Minh left

12:50.561 --> 12:52.484
and he went off his medication.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.697
Interesting.

12:53.690 --> 12:56.409
Did he say
what the medicine was for?

12:56.401 --> 12:58.779
I don't know; he just said
that Minh made him take 'em

12:58.778 --> 13:01.827
to even out his moods
or something like that.

13:01.823 --> 13:04.497
Did he say that--
"even out his moods"?

13:04.492 --> 13:05.664
That's what they usually say

13:05.660 --> 13:07.913
about people
with manic depression.

13:07.912 --> 13:11.917
Uh, maybe we ought
to check on him.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.513
Kahn?

13:21.509 --> 13:24.854
Sadness covers me
like a blanket.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.520
Tuck me in. Let me die.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.196
Uh, maybe he's just sad.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.321
Nope.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.292
He's been swallowed whole
by soul-sucking depression.

13:45.283 --> 13:46.455
Yep.

13:46.451 --> 13:49.455
He reminds me of me when
I was just starting out.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.172
You've got a long way to go.

13:51.164 --> 13:55.169
I'm... just not... ever... good.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.465
Hey, Kahn, if you're depressed,

13:56.461 --> 13:58.338
maybe we could go out
for some ice cream

13:58.338 --> 14:00.306
or watch a funny movie.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.724
What if you gave him one
of coach's pep talks, Hank?

14:04.719 --> 14:06.562
Now, that's a great idea.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.852
Why don't you go
into the girls' locker room

14:08.848 --> 14:10.600
and put on a skirt, Wendy?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.068
Oh, what, you don't like that?

14:12.060 --> 14:14.062
Oh, you gonna cry, huh?

14:16.522 --> 14:20.447
Uh, I guess you are,
uh, going to cry.

14:20.443 --> 14:23.868
All right, we're going to
have to fix this somehow.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.240
I'll confiscate his shoelaces

14:25.239 --> 14:27.207
and the drawstring
from his pants.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.952
People forget the drawstring.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.170
We should try to get
his prescription filled.

14:31.162 --> 14:33.836
So, uh, Kahn, I was thinking

14:33.831 --> 14:35.708
maybe you could throw on
some pants

14:35.708 --> 14:37.927
and come
to the pharmacy with me.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.466
There's no use in going.

14:39.462 --> 14:41.385
I threw prescription away.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.850
Don't even know doctor's name.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.056
You know what I just realized?

14:50.056 --> 14:52.479
I'll never hear
another Huey Lewis song

14:52.475 --> 14:55.194
for the first time again.

14:55.186 --> 14:57.188
Man, I don't know what's
gonna be harder, man.

14:57.188 --> 15:00.192
Fixing dang ol' Kahn or fixing
your dang ol' grill, man.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.417
Grillstravaganza is in four days

15:09.409 --> 15:12.162
and I can't make sense
of Kahn's plans.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.163
I don't know anything
about computers

15:14.163 --> 15:16.165
and his writing
is microscopic...

15:16.165 --> 15:18.167
and in Laotian.

15:18.167 --> 15:22.422
This is like figuring out
a jigsaw puzzle made of clouds.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.174
I just wish this was a movie.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.641
Some music would play

15:25.633 --> 15:27.931
and we would just cut
to when we were all finished.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.099
Well, I've done it.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.607
I've glued a toaster
to a karaoke machine.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.771
Is that something
I was supposed to do, Hank?

15:35.810 --> 15:36.982
This is useless.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.730
We can't finish this
without Kahn,

15:38.729 --> 15:41.733
and Kahn can't finish this
without his medication.

15:41.732 --> 15:44.326
We could just get him the drugs
illegally from Mexico.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.787
They're the exact same medicine,
only cheaper.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.156
And spicier.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.326
Let's do it.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.747
Pardon me, Johnson.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.165
You can call me Ray

15:54.162 --> 15:56.540
or you can call me Jay

15:56.539 --> 15:58.041
or you can call me Ray J.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.166
Or you can call me R.J.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.761
or you can call me R.J.J.,

16:01.752 --> 16:04.426
but you doesn't have
to call me Johnson.

16:04.422 --> 16:05.844
Bobby, dinner!

16:05.840 --> 16:07.057
In a minute!

16:07.049 --> 16:10.178
I'm not coming out
until I crack this.

16:10.178 --> 16:11.600
Yo, Johnson!

16:11.596 --> 16:13.189
You can call me Ray

16:13.181 --> 16:15.104
or you can call me Jay

16:15.266 --> 16:17.189
or you can call me Ray J.

16:17.185 --> 16:18.812
Or you can call me R.J.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.189
or you can call me R.J.J.

16:21.189 --> 16:23.408
But you doesn't have
to call me Johnson.

16:23.399 --> 16:27.575
You doesn't
have to call him Johnson.

16:27.570 --> 16:30.073
Johnson got another one.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.984
I wonder how many pills
Kahn should take.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.198
Maybe, to be on the safe side,

17:04.190 --> 17:06.443
he should take them all.

17:12.073 --> 17:14.075
Oh, man, just, it dang
ol' happened, man.

17:14.075 --> 17:16.077
One minute, he's on couch.
He's all whimpering, whining,

17:16.077 --> 17:17.704
Next minute ol' up
and at 'em, man.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.329
Hank Hill,
about time you got here

17:19.329 --> 17:22.174
'cause I need a 5/16th-inch
drill bit right now, 5/16th.

17:22.165 --> 17:24.089
See, it's a good thing
I'm off my medication.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.878
Now I have lots of energy.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.050
Let's get to work.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.140
Oh, can you help me
move my couch, too?

17:29.131 --> 17:31.133
Actually, Kahn, we were
able to get your med...

17:31.133 --> 17:33.181
Glad to see
you're feeling better, Kahn.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.680
No use in wasting
this good mood, huh?

17:35.680 --> 17:37.603
I'll grab that drill bit.

17:42.645 --> 17:45.649
Peggy, I'm gonna be working
late tonight on the grill.

17:45.648 --> 17:48.151
So, I found a bottle of pills.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.327
It gets better.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.196
They are unlabeled pills.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.197
It gets better.

17:53.197 --> 17:56.417
They are from an unlicensed
Mexican pharmacy.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.628
You have one sentence
to explain.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.417
Uh, well, that's what happens

18:00.413 --> 18:03.132
when you let Boomhauer
borrow your pants.

18:06.377 --> 18:08.379
I accidentally made Kahn

18:08.379 --> 18:10.973
go off his medication
for manic depression,

18:10.965 --> 18:12.763
so I had to get more of it...

18:12.758 --> 18:14.135
from Mexico.

18:14.302 --> 18:16.521
So why are the pills
in your pants

18:16.512 --> 18:17.934
and not in Kahn?

18:17.930 --> 18:19.932
Well, if he goes back
on his medication,

18:19.932 --> 18:22.936
it'll even him out and we'll
never finish the grill.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.529
Grillstravaganza
is riding on this.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.491
Hank Hill, you cannot
withhold Kahn's medication

18:28.482 --> 18:30.860
for some stupid grill!

18:30.860 --> 18:32.077
Come on, Peggy.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.071
Look at him out there,
all full of energy.

18:34.071 --> 18:35.493
It's not hurting anyone.

18:44.332 --> 18:45.333
Huh.

18:46.334 --> 18:47.506
All right, fine.

18:47.501 --> 18:50.095
I'll give him his pills.

18:50.254 --> 18:53.098
Kahn, you have to stop building.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.679
Can't stop now.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.677
The Commander-in-Beef
is almost finished.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.179
Big sale starts tomorrow.

18:58.179 --> 18:59.852
You have to take
your medication.

18:59.847 --> 19:00.939
But I don't want it.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.183
I feel great.

19:02.183 --> 19:04.402
And when I'm off my meds,
I have so much pep.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.191
We're all friends.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.110
See?

19:08.105 --> 19:09.152
Friends.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.150
Well, we'll still be friends.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.152
Not taking your medication
is too risky.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.280
You could slip
into another one of your, uh,

19:15.279 --> 19:17.247
depressive states.

19:18.741 --> 19:21.119
Your health is more important
than the grill.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.120
I guess I see that now.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.964
Aw, Hank Hill,
you care about me.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.503
Well, go on now.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.174
Take 'em so you can get
back to normal.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.967
It's not immediate, Hank.

19:31.962 --> 19:34.806
It's gonna take a day or so
for the pills to work.

19:34.799 --> 19:35.846
Really?

19:35.841 --> 19:37.093
So what happens until then?

19:37.259 --> 19:39.853
I could be manic.
I could be depressed.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.189
Real crapshoot.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.149
Huh.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.401
The suspense is killing me.

19:49.397 --> 19:52.196
Yeah, Kahn's been lying down
for over an hour.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.363
What do you think that means?

19:53.359 --> 19:54.986
Which way is he gonna go?

19:54.985 --> 19:57.079
Oh, man, like a dang ol'
Billy Joel, man,

19:57.071 --> 20:00.166
like a dang ol' sadness
or euphoria, man.

20:03.160 --> 20:06.130
It's manic!

20:08.499 --> 20:11.423
Hey, check this out.

20:11.419 --> 20:14.047
Oh, cool.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.642
Hot damn, Hank!

20:18.634 --> 20:22.480
We just sold more grills than in
the last three years combined.

20:22.471 --> 20:25.395
Whoo! We dry-rubbed it
in Thatherton's face!

20:25.391 --> 20:27.359
Yes, sir, I believe we did.

20:42.283 --> 20:44.126
Hey, there, Kahn.

20:44.285 --> 20:45.457
You're looking well.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.171
You know, balanced.

20:47.163 --> 20:48.085
Yeah.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.466
I just came by to see
the grill in action.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.085
Looks good.
Good?

20:52.251 --> 20:55.425
She's a got-dang
masterpiece, Kahn.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.432
It even knew I was hungry.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.188
I know this grill
almost destroyed

21:04.180 --> 21:06.683
your fragile grasp
on sanity, but...

21:06.682 --> 21:09.185
that is a damn fine burger.

21:09.185 --> 21:12.155
Yeah, all in all, I have
to say it was worth it.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.075
You can taste the pain.

21:53.479 --> 21:56.403
<i>But you doesn't
have to call me Johnson.</i>
