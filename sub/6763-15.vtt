{\an1}I'm afraid it's just
getting worse out there.

01:59.577 --> 02:01.079
In here, too.

02:01.162 --> 02:02.372
{\an3}This is the second time
I've emptied this pot

02:02.455 --> 02:05.917
{\an3}since we got up
this morning.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.669
Honey, we got to do something.

02:07.752 --> 02:10.088
{\an1}There's nothing much we can do
until it stops raining.

02:10.170 --> 02:12.048
{\an1}And after weather
like this,

02:12.131 --> 02:14.384
{\an1}every roofer in town is going
to be backed up for weeks.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.845
{\an3}Well, I just hope it
doesn't get any worse.

02:16.928 --> 02:20.723
{\an3}We'll be having Thanksgiving
dinner in our raincoats.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.936
(both sigh)

02:29.524 --> 02:31.109
Well, I'll bet
your grandma puts out

02:31.192 --> 02:32.944
{\an3}a hell of a Thanksgiving
spread, doesn't she?

02:33.027 --> 02:35.155
{\an1}Yeah, right.
Try boiled chicken.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.699
{\an1}Besides, she went to see
her sister in Miami Beach.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.951
{\an3}So what are you going
to do for dinner?

02:40.034 --> 02:41.744
{\an1}Well, I'm supposed
to go with my parents

02:41.828 --> 02:44.747
to their friends, the Russells,
for a vegetarian Thanksgiving.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.750
{\an1}Every year they make this
tofu and carrot soufflé

02:47.834 --> 02:49.419
in the shape of a turkey.

02:49.502 --> 02:50.753
It's disgusting.

02:50.837 --> 02:51.254
{\an3}But very
politically correct.

02:51.337 --> 02:54.132
Very.

02:54.215 --> 02:57.385
{\an1}Meanwhile, I bet your family
is having a big, juicy

02:57.468 --> 03:01.472
{\an1}sage-rubbed turkey with that
cornbread sausage stuffing

03:01.556 --> 03:04.017
that we had at your house
for Christmas last year, right?

03:04.100 --> 03:06.269
{\an1}Fresh cranberry sauce,
oven-baked rolls,

03:06.352 --> 03:07.896
and pumpkin pie

03:07.979 --> 03:10.398
with real fresh whipped cream.

03:10.481 --> 03:13.443
You forgot Cindy's world-famous
bourbon sweet potatoes.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.361
It sounds great.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.487
Stop drooling, Andrea.

03:16.571 --> 03:17.405
We eat at 6:00.
We watch football all day.

03:17.488 --> 03:19.282
Come over when you want.

03:19.365 --> 03:22.160
Are you sure it's okay
with your folks?

03:22.243 --> 03:23.161
Andrea, would it be a holiday

03:23.244 --> 03:25.079
without a couple of strays
at our house, huh?

03:25.163 --> 03:26.706
Right. Come on.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.669
I was listening
to the ski report in the car.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.755
They're expecting two feet
of fresh powder in Big Bear

03:33.838 --> 03:34.797
by tomorrow morning.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.090
Have fun.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.091
{\an3}I can't believe
you're not going.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.134
{\an3}Don't you
love to ski?

03:38.217 --> 03:40.470
Yes, but I also love the
idea of being home alone.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.972
Mel and Jackie are going away
with the baby to Palm Springs

03:43.056 --> 03:44.766
{\an1}and I actually get
the house to myself.

03:44.849 --> 03:45.808
{\an3}God,
Thanksgiving alone.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.018
{\an3}That's, like, un-American
or something.

03:47.101 --> 03:48.144
Who's spending
Thanksgiving alone?

03:48.227 --> 03:49.062
{\an3}Kelly is.

03:49.145 --> 03:50.980
{\an1}No, you're not.
You're coming to my house.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.149
No, actually, Bren,
I'm looking forward

03:53.232 --> 03:54.984
{\an1}to spending some
quality time by myself.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.819
{\an3}Oh, no, I need
somebody to talk to

03:56.903 --> 03:58.196
during all those
football games.

03:58.279 --> 04:00.281
Please?
Well, okay.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.532
{\an1}But just because
you begged.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.035
{\an3}I don't mean
to start anything,

04:04.118 --> 04:05.703
{\an3}but do you know where
Dylan's spending Thanksgiving?

04:05.787 --> 04:07.830
No, I don't, and I
really don't care.

04:07.914 --> 04:08.873
Ditto.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.209
{\an3}Why don't I believe
you guys?

04:14.545 --> 04:16.172
How many more of these things
I gotta sign?

04:16.255 --> 04:17.173
Oh, just one.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.132
{\an3}You are 18, correct?
Yep.

04:19.216 --> 04:20.802
And this is a working

04:20.885 --> 04:21.844
{\an1}phone number?
Yeah.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.346
You don't have

04:23.429 --> 04:25.014
{\an6}call forwarding on
your line, do you?
No, why?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.933
Well, I'm going to have
to be calling there

04:27.016 --> 04:28.726
once in the morning and once
at bedtime to make sure

04:28.810 --> 04:30.853
your father's there--
with call forwarding,

04:30.937 --> 04:32.689
he could be anywhere
and we'd never know it.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.024
We don't have to, like, stay
in the house the whole time,

04:35.108 --> 04:36.484
{\an3}do we?
No.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.361
{\an3}But if you
go anywhere,

04:38.444 --> 04:39.487
{\an3}like a movie
or, uh, dinner,

04:39.570 --> 04:41.864
we'll need receipts.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.533
You're gonna have to be
with him at all times.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.910
Okay.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.412
This is a responsibility, Dylan.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.622
You sure you're up to it?

04:49.706 --> 04:51.874
{\an3}It's not like I have
a lot of choices.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.543
If you don't want to do this,

04:53.626 --> 04:56.546
just speak up now,
because your father

04:56.629 --> 04:57.547
is very eager
to make this visit.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.008
You should hear him
talk about you.

05:00.091 --> 05:00.675
Yeah, I'll bet.

05:00.758 --> 05:02.885
You know, the primary reason

05:02.969 --> 05:04.220
we permit holiday furloughs
like this

05:04.303 --> 05:06.597
{\an1}is to help
our population

05:06.681 --> 05:09.892
maintain some sort of normalcy,
particularly in

05:09.976 --> 05:11.853
{\an1}their family
relationships.

05:11.936 --> 05:14.397
This relationship wasn't
that normal to begin with.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.024
Give him a chance.

05:16.107 --> 05:19.402
{\an1}A year or so behind bars
can change a man.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.404
{\an3}Dylan...

05:21.487 --> 05:22.405
Hey, Jack.

05:22.488 --> 05:23.698
{\an3}Thanks for
doing this, kid.

05:23.781 --> 05:24.907
{\an3}It means
a lot to me.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.409
Ah, I didn't have
any other plans.

05:26.492 --> 05:27.702
Good luck, Jack.

05:27.785 --> 05:28.911
{\an1}I'll be calling
you tonight.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.288
{\an5}Frank, happy
Thanksgiving.
You, too.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.248
{\an3}Let's get the hell
out of here. Come on.

05:32.331 --> 05:33.833
{\an1}Take care.
Okay.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.353
Boy, am I glad you're here.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.104
Why? Can't be
many customers

05:55.188 --> 05:56.814
on a miserable
day like this.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.441
{\an1}No, not many.
Just one in particular.

05:58.524 --> 06:01.569
Who?
Sanders.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.946
{\an3}He's been here
all morning.

06:04.030 --> 06:04.781
{\an3}You gotta talk
to him, Brandon.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.450
{\an3}He's a nervous wreck.
You got it.

06:07.533 --> 06:11.496
(indistinct music playing)

06:19.545 --> 06:23.174
{\an3}Trying to drown your sorrows
in lactose there, Stevie?

06:23.257 --> 06:25.802
{\an1}I thought a couple milkshakes
might settle my stomach.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.262
{\an1}It's only making
matters worse.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.139
{\an3}You haven't told
your mom yet, huh?

06:30.223 --> 06:31.766
No. My mom's out of town.

06:31.849 --> 06:34.769
I don't think I should tell her
I got kicked out of school

06:34.852 --> 06:36.145
while she's on the phone.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.190
Well, seems to me,
no matter how you slice it,

06:39.273 --> 06:40.817
it's gonna be tough.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.820
I think you better just get a
hold of yourself and lay it out.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.447
How does this sound?

06:46.531 --> 06:49.909
{\an1}"Mom, there's no
easy way to say this,

06:49.992 --> 06:51.661
"so I'll just come
right out with it.

06:51.744 --> 06:55.373
I got kicked out of school.
It's no big deal."

06:55.456 --> 06:58.835
Well, that might work...
if she's in a sympathetic mood.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.628
Brandon, will you
come over tonight?

07:00.711 --> 07:03.756
Steve, I really think

07:03.840 --> 07:06.092
this is something
you should do on your own.

07:06.175 --> 07:09.095
I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.355
(knocking)

07:19.438 --> 07:22.024
Steve, darling.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.026
Mom.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.028
{\an3}Oh, how are you,
gorgeous?

07:26.112 --> 07:27.530
I missed you.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.031
How was your trip?

07:29.115 --> 07:29.866
Oh, the usual.

07:29.949 --> 07:33.327
You know those
small town ad agencies.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.830
I spend an hour
recording their commercial

07:35.913 --> 07:37.665
and the rest of the time

07:37.748 --> 07:38.708
{\an3}schmoozing
the clients.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.877
So, you all packed?

07:40.960 --> 07:42.712
For what?

07:42.795 --> 07:44.755
Steve, I told you weeks ago.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.550
We're going to Santa Barbara
to do <i> Escape of the Stars.</i>

07:47.633 --> 07:50.178
The television show?

07:50.261 --> 07:52.763
{\an6}Oh, no...
You forgot,
didn't you?

07:52.847 --> 07:54.557
That's okay.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.559
Just throw some things
in a bag and hurry.

07:56.642 --> 08:00.271
The limo will be here
in one hour.

08:00.354 --> 08:03.399
{\an1}Mom... do I have
to do this?

08:03.482 --> 08:04.692
{\an3}Yes.

08:04.775 --> 08:07.695
The producers insisted
that it be a family affair.

08:07.778 --> 08:10.364
{\an3}Now, be
a trooper, huh?

08:10.448 --> 08:11.407
{\an3}Besides,
you'll have fun.

08:11.490 --> 08:15.328
They tell me it is
the ultimate fantasy getaway.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.790
Honey, do you feel okay?

08:19.874 --> 08:22.084
Yeah, I'm fine.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.086
This isn't exactly how I thought

08:24.170 --> 08:25.755
I'd spend my Thanksgiving,
that's all.

08:25.838 --> 08:26.714
Don't worry.

08:26.797 --> 08:28.841
We're going to have
a fabulous time.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.888
(chuckles)

08:33.971 --> 08:35.890
(sighs)

08:38.893 --> 08:40.895
Nice house.

08:40.977 --> 08:42.104
Yeah, thanks.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.438
{\an3}Make yourself
at home.

08:43.522 --> 08:44.440
Where's the ice?

08:44.524 --> 08:45.608
Coming up.

08:45.691 --> 08:46.651
You don't know how good

08:46.734 --> 08:48.361
{\an1}the thought of a drink
feels right now.

08:48.444 --> 08:49.820
Yes, I do.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.785
You know, I've always loved
these Craftsman bungalows.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.329
In fact, I rented one
almost like this

08:58.412 --> 09:00.289
when I first came to California.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.084
{\an1}Didn't have any
money then either.

09:03.167 --> 09:04.085
Here you go.

09:04.168 --> 09:05.211
Thank you.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.883
Here's to freedom.

09:13.177 --> 09:16.931
It's okay, I mean, if I, uh,
if I drink around here, right?

09:17.014 --> 09:19.058
Oh, yeah.
Knock it back. Enjoy yourself.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.062
Well, in that case,
where's the phone at?

09:24.313 --> 09:25.273
I thought your
parole officer

09:25.356 --> 09:26.315
was supposed
to call you.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.483
Oh, he is, he is.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.609
He's gonna call me
around bedtime

09:28.693 --> 09:29.944
and make sure I'm tucked in.

09:30.027 --> 09:31.821
Well, I'm calling someone
who I'm gonna be tucked in with.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.323
{\an1}A drink's not the only thing
I got in mind right now.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.450
Jack, you never change.

09:36.534 --> 09:37.660
Dylan, come on.
I've got 48 hours of freedom,

09:37.743 --> 09:39.829
I'm gonna make damn sure
I enjoy every minute of it.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.914
{\an1}You'd do
the same thing.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.874
Or did AA tell you
to give up women, too?

09:43.958 --> 09:45.668
You think that's funny?

09:45.751 --> 09:48.087
(laughs):
Well, yes, I do.

09:49.463 --> 09:50.923
Come on, Dylan.
I'm only kidding around.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.926
I'm only gonna say this
one time, Jack.

09:54.010 --> 09:54.885
The only reason
I agreed to do this

09:54.969 --> 09:56.679
{\an3}was because of you,
all right?

09:56.762 --> 09:58.347
Your parole officer
thought it'd be good

09:58.431 --> 10:00.516
{\an3}to give you a chance to
re-bond with your family.

10:00.599 --> 10:01.892
{\an3}If you want to re-bond
with some bimbo,

10:01.976 --> 10:02.977
do it somewhere else.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.854
Christine is not a bimbo.
Fine.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.565
{\an3}So you call her, then you call
the Beverly Hills Hotel,

10:07.648 --> 10:08.858
'cause that's where you're
gonna be staying tonight.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.192
Look, Dylan, could we just be

10:10.276 --> 10:12.153
{\an6}a little rational
about this thing?
Yes, we can.

10:12.236 --> 10:13.821
Call your parole officer and let
him know where he can reach you.

10:13.904 --> 10:14.864
Where's it gonna be?

10:14.947 --> 10:16.532
What the hell is your problem?

10:16.615 --> 10:18.034
{\an3}I don't got
a problem. You do.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.201
You're acting like a child.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.328
{\an3}You think so?
Yes, I do.

10:20.411 --> 10:24.749
Okay, let's call it making up
for lost time,<i> Dad.</i>

10:50.858 --> 10:52.902
{\an1}Hey, hey...
what are you doing?

10:52.985 --> 10:55.905
{\an3}Singing in the rain.
What does it look like?

11:01.327 --> 11:03.245
Hey!

11:03.329 --> 11:05.790
{\an1}Why don't you buy
yourself some food?

11:10.961 --> 11:13.839
Thanks.

11:33.067 --> 11:36.070
Hey!

11:36.153 --> 11:38.239
Yo-ho!

11:38.322 --> 11:39.824
{\an3}What are you trying
to do, kill me?

11:39.907 --> 11:42.118
You're Canner, aren't you?
Jack Canner?

11:42.201 --> 11:44.495
Who the hell are you?
I'm Brandon Walsh.

11:44.578 --> 11:46.330
I met you at the beach
this summer.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.499
I don't remember that.

11:48.582 --> 11:50.126
{\an1}Remember?
I'm sure you remember.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.168
{\an1}The Beverly Hills
Beach Club.

11:51.252 --> 11:54.505
I got you a job interview,
but you never showed up.

11:54.588 --> 11:55.506
Or don't you remember that,
either?

11:55.589 --> 11:58.968
I just can't seem
to get rid of you, can I?

11:59.051 --> 12:02.179
No, I guess not.

12:02.263 --> 12:03.931
{\an3}Look, uh, I know
I look like hell...

12:04.014 --> 12:07.977
Yeah, that's what you said
the first time I met you.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.646
{\an3}Yeah. Well, sorry I can't
be more original.

12:10.729 --> 12:12.273
(laughs)

12:12.356 --> 12:13.232
You know, the forecast says

12:13.315 --> 12:16.569
{\an1}this isn't supposed
to let up for a few days.

12:16.652 --> 12:18.821
You can't stay
out here, man.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.323
Why not?

12:21.407 --> 12:23.325
Hey, Canner!

12:23.409 --> 12:24.702
Canner!

12:24.785 --> 12:25.953
What?!

12:26.036 --> 12:27.663
I work here, man.

12:27.746 --> 12:29.457
At least let me feed you, huh?

12:36.922 --> 12:39.175
Hey, Nat?

12:39.258 --> 12:40.009
{\an3}What'd you
forget, pal?

12:40.092 --> 12:41.927
Uh...
(clears throat)

12:42.011 --> 12:44.430
What's wrong?

12:44.513 --> 12:44.889
{\an1}Nothing.
This is Jack Canner.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.015
Is the coffee

12:46.098 --> 12:49.393
{\an1}still on?
I could put up a pot.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.021
Uh, Jack's a vet.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.898
He's a Marine.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.942
Go sit down, pal.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.866
Yo, come here.

13:06.827 --> 13:08.037
What gives here?

13:08.120 --> 13:10.372
I know this guy, Nat.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.666
{\an3}I tried to get him a job
this summer at the Beach Club.

13:12.750 --> 13:13.667
Found him out back

13:13.751 --> 13:15.503
going through
the Dumpster.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.757
You sure you know
what you're doing?

13:22.301 --> 13:23.469
No.

13:23.552 --> 13:26.388
(both laugh)

13:33.979 --> 13:36.899
How's the food?

13:36.982 --> 13:39.735
Oh, hey, this is great, really.

13:39.818 --> 13:40.736
Thanks a lot, man.

13:40.819 --> 13:41.153
{\an1}(sighs)

13:41.237 --> 13:42.071
You know, it's,

13:42.154 --> 13:44.865
it's a lot easier
to deal with things

13:44.949 --> 13:47.326
when you've got something
in your stomach.

13:47.409 --> 13:49.912
It's harder to get a handout
out in the rain.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.080
People don't like
to get their arms wet.

13:53.290 --> 13:55.084
{\an1}So, um,
you work here, huh?

13:55.167 --> 13:55.918
{\an3}Yeah.

13:56.001 --> 13:58.963
Yeah, I've been here
about two years now.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.923
You know, part-
time, weekends.

14:01.006 --> 14:01.423
Yeah, well, that's good.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.093

{\an3}They have a
shelter there.

14:12.893 --> 14:15.896
I could give you a ride
over there if you want.

14:15.980 --> 14:16.939
I don't go to the shelters, man.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.733
Well, why not?

14:19.817 --> 14:23.904
Well, I figure
if I can keep going on my own,

14:23.988 --> 14:26.115
you know, that means something,

14:26.198 --> 14:30.828

I go to one of those places

You know, all summer long

14:41.213 --> 14:43.966
camp out out there,
and pretend it was an adventure,

16:16.141 --> 16:18.310
{\an3}Well, Mom, I guess even
the houses in Beverly Hills

16:18.394 --> 16:19.937
{\an1}spring a leak
now and then, huh?

16:20.020 --> 16:21.105
{\an3}Yeah, well, it snowed
in Minneapolis,

16:21.188 --> 16:22.898
{\an3}but it never made
the roof leak.

16:23.857 --> 16:26.068
Hey, it smells good in here.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.069
Yeah, Mom's
been cooking

16:27.152 --> 16:27.903
{\an1}for hours.

16:27.986 --> 16:29.238
{\an3}Honey, come in and
close the door.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.073
{\an3}We got enough water
in here as it is.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.033
Well, I,
I kind of brought somebody home.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.034
{\an3}JIM:
Fine.

16:34.118 --> 16:34.952

{\an1}Uh... Mom, Dad, Brenda,
this is Jack Canner.

16:47.005 --> 16:51.885
Jack, this is my family.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.053
How do you do?

17:10.028 --> 17:12.239
Hello?

17:13.699 --> 17:14.867
I'm Samantha Sanders.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.285
This is my son Steve.

17:16.367 --> 17:17.118
Hi.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.787
Well, it would be nice

17:18.871 --> 17:20.580
if there was someone
here to meet us

17:20.664 --> 17:24.667
or, failing that, someone
who knows what they're doing.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.587
{\an3}This is going
to be fun.

17:26.670 --> 17:27.671
{\an3}Alyssa!

17:27.755 --> 17:29.715
The talent is here!

17:29.798 --> 17:31.300
{\an3}ALYSSA:
Oh, God, already?

17:31.383 --> 17:33.302
{\an3}I-I'll be
right down.

17:37.848 --> 17:39.558
I'm having fun.

17:39.641 --> 17:40.517
{\an3}Steve,

17:40.601 --> 17:41.977
behave yourself.

17:42.060 --> 17:43.812
{\an3}Absolutely.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.314
Hi, I'm Alyssa Garner.

17:45.397 --> 17:46.523
I'm the production assistant.

17:47.941 --> 17:49.151
{\an1}Mrs. Sanders, I would
recognize you anywhere.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.320
Thank you.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.781
{\an3}This is my
son Steve.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.449
{\an1}Hi.
Oh, you're Steve?

17:55.532 --> 17:58.494
{\an1}I was expecting
a little kid.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.454
{\an3}Sorry to
disappoint you.

18:00.537 --> 18:01.830
{\an1}Well, no,
I'm not disappointed,

18:01.914 --> 18:03.373
{\an1}but I guess I'll have
to cancel the toy delivery.

18:03.457 --> 18:04.374
(chuckles)

18:04.458 --> 18:06.335
Depends on the toys.

18:06.418 --> 18:07.878
{\an3}Uh, listen,

18:07.961 --> 18:11.381
if you don't mind, I'd like
to go to my room and unpack.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.382
Oh, of course.

18:12.466 --> 18:13.801
{\an1}It's right at the top
of the stairs,

18:13.884 --> 18:14.802
{\an1}second door
to your left.

18:14.885 --> 18:16.678
That's it?

18:16.762 --> 18:18.472
There's no one
to help with the bags?

18:18.555 --> 18:21.475
{\an1}Oh, no, uh, the staff
won't be here till tomorrow

18:21.558 --> 18:23.477
{\an1}and they're
all just actors anyway.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.230
But I was led to believe

18:26.313 --> 18:28.649
that these were
luxury accommodations.

18:28.732 --> 18:31.026
Uh... who may I speak to?

18:31.109 --> 18:32.069
Is your boss here?

18:32.152 --> 18:36.532
{\an1}No, nobody's here but me
and the crew, Mrs. Sanders.

18:36.615 --> 18:37.366
{\an1}Didn't anybody
explain this to you?

18:37.449 --> 18:38.367
{\an3}No.

18:38.450 --> 18:41.245
No one explained.

18:41.328 --> 18:45.040
My agent just told me
that this was a luxury getaway.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.166
Oh, come on, Mom.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.043
It's not going
to be that bad.

18:48.126 --> 18:49.336
{\an3}I'll help you
with your bags.

18:54.466 --> 18:57.553
{\an1}Whoever Brenda and Brandon had
for a Sunday school teacher

18:57.636 --> 18:59.429
{\an1}must have been
pretty damn good.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.890
{\an1}You ever seen
such a literal interpretation

19:01.974 --> 19:02.975
of the golden rule?

19:03.058 --> 19:04.351
{\an3}Oh, Jim, most parents
would give their eyeteeth

19:04.434 --> 19:06.395
{\an3}to be complaining
about kids like ours.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.729
I'm not complaining.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.231
{\an1}I just don't think
this is such a good idea.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.524
{\an1}I mean, we don't know
anything about that man.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.067
{\an3}Well, fine.

19:12.150 --> 19:14.236
{\an3}If that's the way you feel,
then ask him to leave.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.280
No. No, n-no, no.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.407
{\an1}I am not going to be cast
as the bad guy in this.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.409
Honey, please.

19:20.492 --> 19:25.372
{\an3}I mean, Brandon said he's lost
his home and his family.

19:25.455 --> 19:26.456
{\an3}We can put a cot up
in the garage.

19:26.540 --> 19:30.085
It's only for one night.

19:30.168 --> 19:31.211
(door opens)

19:36.842 --> 19:37.467
{\an1}Uh, your daughter
gave me

19:37.551 --> 19:39.720
some of your clothes, sir.

19:39.803 --> 19:41.221
I hope it's okay.

19:41.305 --> 19:45.642
{\an1}No... no...
it's quite all right.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.102
{\an1}You know,
it really feels good

19:47.185 --> 19:48.478
{\an1}to get into something
clean and dry.

19:48.562 --> 19:51.940
I almost feel
like a human again.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.734
{\an1}Are you hungry?
Oh, thanks,

19:53.817 --> 19:54.735
but no.

19:54.818 --> 19:55.694
Brandon and Nat
took care of that.

19:55.777 --> 19:57.988
{\an4}BRANDON:
Listen, guys,
I hope it's all right.

19:58.071 --> 20:00.282
I told Jack he could
sleep in the garage.

20:00.365 --> 20:00.866
No.

20:00.949 --> 20:02.409
{\an3}I-It's not
all right.

20:02.492 --> 20:05.454
Jim.

20:05.537 --> 20:08.957
I'm sure Mr. Canner would
be much more comfortable

20:09.041 --> 20:09.583
{\an3}on the living
room sofa.

20:09.666 --> 20:12.085
Uh, I-I couldn't do that.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.462
Well, nonsense.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.297
Oh, you can't go
back out there.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.506
Look, you'll stay here

20:16.590 --> 20:18.342
{\an1}and you'll have
Thanksgiving dinner with us.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.470
Thank you.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.931
(clears throat)

20:24.014 --> 20:25.349
Now I know where your son
got his good heart from.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.476
Oh.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.819
Good morning.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.488
{\an3}There's some coffee in the
kitchen if you want it.

20:40.530 --> 20:43.784
Don't do me any favors.

20:43.867 --> 20:46.828
Fine.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.330
You get a newspaper here?

20:48.413 --> 20:50.457
Check the porch.

21:02.719 --> 21:04.388
You know, Dylan...

21:04.471 --> 21:06.515
I might as well
have stayed in Lompoc.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.685
Just say the word,
we'll get the car.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.399
{\an1}What the hell did I do
to make you so damn angry?

21:15.482 --> 21:16.400
{\an1}You make it out
like I'm a pervert

21:16.483 --> 21:18.860
{\an1}'cause I want
to see an old friend.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.195
{\an3}Hey, look, if it's
that big a deal,

21:20.278 --> 21:21.238
the phone is
right there.

21:21.321 --> 21:22.531
{\an3}What do I
care anyway?

21:33.542 --> 21:35.502
Donna, David,
what are you two doing here?

21:35.585 --> 21:37.546
The snow was
up to here.

21:37.629 --> 21:38.547
The roads are closed.

21:38.630 --> 21:39.548
{\an1}My parents are already
up in Big Bear,

21:39.631 --> 21:41.717
{\an1}and we have
nowhere else to go.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.093
Got any turkey left?

21:43.176 --> 21:44.845
Mom, set two more!

21:44.928 --> 21:46.763
In, in, in, in.

21:46.847 --> 21:49.683
(football game playing
on television)

21:49.766 --> 21:50.684
Hi, Mr. Walsh.

21:50.767 --> 21:51.893
Happy Thanksgiving.

21:51.977 --> 21:52.602
I, uh, I hope
we're not intruding.

21:52.686 --> 21:53.645
{\an3}The more
the merrier.

21:53.729 --> 21:54.563
{\an3}(chuckles)

21:54.646 --> 21:56.815
How you doing?
How you doing?

21:58.066 --> 21:59.234
Uh, how do you do?

21:59.317 --> 22:00.402
I'm David Silver.
Hey.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.070
{\an3}Oh, hey, this
is Jack Canner.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.864
{\an3}We met at the Beach
Club this summer.

22:03.947 --> 22:05.866
Hi, I'm Donna.

22:05.949 --> 22:06.867
{\an3}Okay, let's
go, Dallas.

22:06.950 --> 22:07.868
Come on, baby.

22:07.951 --> 22:08.577
ANNOUNCER:
Here's Aikman.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.579
He's rolling out to his right.

22:10.662 --> 22:11.413
And he gets it away.

22:11.496 --> 22:12.414
Does he?

22:12.497 --> 22:14.583
What?

22:14.666 --> 22:17.586
Now they go without a huddle
from the 45.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.588
It's Emmett Smith up the middle,

22:19.671 --> 22:22.299
but a good defensive effort
stops him

22:22.382 --> 22:24.968
with about a three-yard gain.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.762
{\an4}DONNA:
You know, that guy
looks really familiar.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.056
{\an3}I think he's a patient
of my father's.

22:29.139 --> 22:30.223
I doubt that, Donna.

22:30.307 --> 22:31.767
He's homeless.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.101
{\an3}What?

22:33.185 --> 22:35.270
Yeah, Brandon dragged him
in off the street.

22:35.353 --> 22:35.771
Dallas with no time-outs left.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.981
You're kidding.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.441
Would I kid
about something like that?

22:39.524 --> 22:41.109
{\an4}BRANDON:
He's gone.
He's off to the races.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.152
{\an1}He's off
to the races!

22:42.235 --> 22:43.528
BOTH:
He... could...

22:43.612 --> 22:45.489
go... all... the...

22:45.572 --> 22:47.407
DAVID:
What happened?

22:47.491 --> 22:49.785
{\an1}(sighs)
The cable went out.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.620
{\an3}Man, this always
happens when it rains.

22:51.703 --> 22:52.788
Great. That's just great.

22:52.871 --> 22:53.789
{\an1}BRENDA:
Calm down.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.415
{\an1}It'll be
back on in a minute.

22:55.499 --> 22:56.458
{\an6}BRANDON:
That's easy
for you to say.

22:56.541 --> 22:58.376
{\an3}I got a lot of
money on this game.

23:00.462 --> 23:01.630
A lot?

23:01.713 --> 23:03.965
Just how much is a lot?

23:04.049 --> 23:06.301
{\an3}BRANDON:
Did I say "a lot"?

23:06.384 --> 23:07.302
(chuckles)

23:07.385 --> 23:09.638
I-I meant a little, Dad,
just-just a little.

23:11.681 --> 23:14.476
I like atlases, too.

23:14.559 --> 23:17.646
I love to fantasize about
the places I might visit.

23:17.729 --> 23:20.732
Actually, I'm just kind of
looking at where I've been.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.986
{\an3}You know, you're
the camp counselor

23:25.070 --> 23:26.446
{\an3}from the
beach, right?

23:26.530 --> 23:28.448
{\an3}The one with the kites
and the deaf kid.

23:28.532 --> 23:28.824
That's right.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.201
{\an3}Oh, yeah.

23:31.284 --> 23:33.662
You were pretty scared of
me the first time we met.

23:33.745 --> 23:37.290
A little.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.500
{\an1}You've been, um,
out there

23:38.583 --> 23:42.337
{\an1}living on the streets
this whole time, haven't you?

23:42.420 --> 23:45.257
Um, yeah, I have.

23:45.340 --> 23:47.008
So show me where you were.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.176
What do you mean?

23:48.260 --> 23:48.510
{\an1}In the Gulf--
where you were stationed.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.887
{\an3}Oh, well.

23:50.971 --> 23:53.014
{\an4}BRANDON:
Hey, Jack, why don't you
bring that over here?

23:53.098 --> 23:54.474
{\an1}We'd all like
to take a look.

23:54.558 --> 23:57.561
Come on. Come on.

23:57.644 --> 24:00.105
(sighs)

24:01.940 --> 24:03.483
Sure you want to see this?

24:03.567 --> 24:03.775
Yeah.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.694
Well...

24:05.777 --> 24:10.490
{\an1}Let's see, well,
the Marines started out

24:10.574 --> 24:10.907
about right here

24:10.991 --> 24:13.201
at Al Jubayl.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.494
That's just north of Dhahran

24:14.578 --> 24:16.705
{\an1}where you saw
the TV guys hanging out.

24:16.788 --> 24:19.708
{\an1}And then from there,
we moved, uh, into Kuwait.

24:19.791 --> 24:22.377
{\an4}As a matter of fact,
it was this time
last year that I

24:22.460 --> 24:23.753
{\an3}was having Thanksgiving
dinner with President Bush.

24:23.837 --> 24:28.049
{\an1}Now we're both
out of work.

24:28.133 --> 24:31.386
{\an3}Wait a minute-- wasn't
that, um, two years ago?

24:31.469 --> 24:33.430
{\an1}Oh, yeah, I guess
you're right.

24:33.513 --> 24:35.932
{\an1}Must have lost
a year somewhere.

24:36.016 --> 24:37.225
Well, at least
you were there.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.560
That's something
to be proud of.

24:38.643 --> 24:40.812
Yeah, I was there.

24:40.896 --> 24:43.648
{\an1}How about you, Mr. Walsh,
you ever serve?

24:46.318 --> 24:48.069
Uh, the only thing
I ever serve is drinks.

24:48.153 --> 24:50.113
Think your mother could
use some help right now.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.706
{\an3}So, how's it
going in here?

24:59.789 --> 25:00.707
{\an1}Oh, everything's
all brown and bubbly.

25:00.790 --> 25:03.084
{\an1}How are the troops
holding out?

25:03.168 --> 25:04.461
Great.

25:04.544 --> 25:07.130
{\an3}Our homeless guest
is playing war hero.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.548
Ah, Jim.

25:08.632 --> 25:09.549
So he was a Marine.

25:09.633 --> 25:10.926
So big deal.

25:11.009 --> 25:11.593
Look, honey, no matter
what you might think,

25:11.676 --> 25:13.595
{\an3}he did
sacrifice a lot.

25:13.678 --> 25:16.431
I mean, he lost his
home and his family.

25:16.514 --> 25:17.265
Well, whose fault is that?

25:17.349 --> 25:19.559
{\an1}Brandon said he tried
to get him a job,

25:19.643 --> 25:22.020
{\an1}the guy never even
showed up.

25:22.103 --> 25:24.481
Jim, just relax

25:24.564 --> 25:26.775
{\an3}and let him enjoy
Thanksgiving.

25:26.858 --> 25:29.653
{\an3}You, too.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.657
{\an1}Oh, and take this
to the kids.

25:33.740 --> 25:35.784
And be nice.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.085
(knocking at door)

25:48.421 --> 25:49.881
She's <i> your</i> bimbo.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.304
Christine.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.305
Honey.
Hi, lady.

25:57.389 --> 25:57.806
Oh, God.

25:57.889 --> 26:00.433
(kissing loudly)

26:00.517 --> 26:02.560
(Christine giggling)

26:02.644 --> 26:03.853
Oh, let me take
these from you.

26:03.937 --> 26:04.896
(chuckles):
Okay.

26:04.980 --> 26:05.981
{\an3}Dylan, make
yourself useful.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.941
{\an1}CHRISTINE:
I brought you some flowers.

26:08.024 --> 26:08.942
{\an1}JACK:
Great.

26:09.025 --> 26:11.444
Here we go.

26:11.528 --> 26:12.988
All right.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.490
{\an3}What, are we making
cranberry sauce?

26:15.573 --> 26:17.158
Hardly.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.995
{\an4}Do a lot of things
real well, but, uh,
cooking isn't one of them.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.289
(chuckles)
Let me take a look at you.

26:22.372 --> 26:23.748
{\an1}Oh, no,
wait till later.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.458
{\an1}Everything looks better
in the dark.

26:25.542 --> 26:26.876
(chuckles)

26:26.960 --> 26:29.337
{\an1}Christine, this is
my son, Dylan.

26:29.421 --> 26:30.380
How do you do?

26:30.463 --> 26:32.507
Nice to meet you.

26:32.590 --> 26:33.842
{\an1}Well, food smells good.
Where'd you go?

26:33.925 --> 26:35.677
{\an3}Oh, little place
I used to hang out

26:35.760 --> 26:37.637
{\an3}when I first came to L.A.
called the Peach Pit.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.347
{\an1}Place sure has been
through some changes,

26:39.431 --> 26:42.183
but the owner says the
food's still the same.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.019
You mean Nat?

26:44.102 --> 26:46.646
Yeah, that's him.

26:46.730 --> 26:47.647
You know him?

26:47.731 --> 26:49.524
{\an1}Yeah, I do.
Well,

26:49.607 --> 26:51.901
any friend of Nat's
is a friend of mine.

26:58.408 --> 27:00.869
(giggles)

27:03.830 --> 27:06.041
ALYSSA:
<i>Find anything good?</i>

27:06.124 --> 27:08.752
Yeah. Try this.

27:08.835 --> 27:10.170
Oh, thanks.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.006
Now, that's delicious.

27:13.089 --> 27:16.051
{\an6}So what does a
production assistant
do on a show like this?

27:16.134 --> 27:17.552
{\an1}Same thing a P.A.
does anywhere:

27:17.635 --> 27:19.554
absolutely everything.

27:19.637 --> 27:20.555
(laughs)

27:20.638 --> 27:21.264
Do you like it?

27:21.348 --> 27:24.059
Yeah. I get to
travel a lot.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.685
{\an3}And the upside
to that,

27:25.769 --> 27:28.438
{\an3}I get a lot of
frequent flier miles.

27:28.521 --> 27:30.774
{\an3}Of course, I never
have time to use them.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.817
So how about you?

27:32.901 --> 27:35.236
Did you live your whole
life in Beverly Hills?

27:35.320 --> 27:36.154
Yep.

27:36.237 --> 27:38.948
Well, that's not a
bad way to grow up.

27:39.032 --> 27:41.409
Mmm, I guess.

27:41.493 --> 27:42.952
{\an3}So did you decide what
college you're gonna go to?

27:47.624 --> 27:49.417
Yeah, I thought I did.

27:49.501 --> 27:50.043
{\an3}Let's see.

27:50.126 --> 27:52.921
{\an3}You want to
go to S.C.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.215
{\an1}(both laughing)
Oh, man.

27:55.298 --> 27:58.426
Yeah, well, not much chance
of that happening anymore.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.427
Why?

27:59.511 --> 28:01.221
I got thrown out.

28:01.304 --> 28:02.430
You're a bad boy?

28:02.514 --> 28:05.725
To put it mildly.

28:05.809 --> 28:09.062
When my mom finds out,
it's gonna break her heart.

28:09.145 --> 28:10.772
She's gonna kill me.

28:10.855 --> 28:12.440
Well, which is it?

28:12.524 --> 28:14.734
Is it gonna break her heart,
or is she gonna kill you?

28:14.818 --> 28:15.902
Ha, ha, ha.

28:15.985 --> 28:18.488
{\an3}Hey, what's
Samantha like?

28:18.571 --> 28:21.408
You can never tell with
celebrity types, you know.

28:21.491 --> 28:22.951
They act one way
when they're on camera,

28:23.034 --> 28:24.285
and then their personalities

28:24.369 --> 28:25.495
are totally different
when they're off.

28:25.578 --> 28:27.288
Yeah, my mom's just like that.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.374
In fact...

28:31.042 --> 28:34.796
She's a totally different person
when the camera's rolling.

28:39.467 --> 28:41.261
{\an3}Does anybody else want
a sandwich or something?

28:41.344 --> 28:43.471
Brandon, Mom will kill you
if you eat before dinner.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.598
{\an3}Just a little something
to tide me over.

28:51.062 --> 28:54.315
{\an1}So you're
homeless, huh?

28:54.399 --> 28:55.400
{\an1}BRENDA:
Donna...

28:58.570 --> 28:59.487
{\an1}I'm sorry.

28:59.571 --> 29:02.449
{\an1}I've just never met
a homeless person before.

29:02.532 --> 29:03.992
{\an4}KELLY:
You'll have to
forgive Donna,

29:04.075 --> 29:05.660
{\an6}Mr. Canner.
See, she thinks
it's a tragedy

29:05.743 --> 29:07.120
{\an3}to leave home without
her gold card.

29:07.203 --> 29:08.538
It's not funny.

29:08.621 --> 29:10.874
I mean, there are a lot of
people out there suffering.

29:10.957 --> 29:14.210
{\an3}A lot of people who have
somehow let life's loose ends

29:14.294 --> 29:16.045
{\an3}slip through their fingers,
and they can't get them back.

29:16.129 --> 29:19.048
{\an3}I mean, they're hungry,
their children are hungry,

29:19.132 --> 29:21.176
{\an3}their clothes are
wearing thin,

29:21.259 --> 29:22.302
they're out on
the street with

29:22.385 --> 29:23.887
{\an3}nowhere to sleep
except out in the rain.

29:23.970 --> 29:26.473
They got a few more problems to
worry about than whether or not

29:26.556 --> 29:29.517
{\an3}the cable TV is out or whether
or not they should have

29:29.601 --> 29:31.561
{\an3}a sandwich before they eat
their dinner, you know?

29:31.644 --> 29:33.396
{\an1}I think that's uncalled for,
Mr. Canner.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.190
{\an4}What?
You're a guest
in this house.

29:35.273 --> 29:36.900
I think it's unfair
to blame these kids

29:36.983 --> 29:38.359
for the problems
you might have.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.236
Well, what is fair, Mr. Walsh?

29:40.320 --> 29:41.654
{\an3}You don't know
what's fair

29:41.738 --> 29:43.364
until one of your kids
looks you in the eye

29:43.448 --> 29:45.492
and wonders why they don't have
a place to live.

29:45.575 --> 29:47.744
Where are your children,
Mr. Canner?

29:49.787 --> 29:51.164
{\an1}Yeah.

29:51.247 --> 29:54.417
That's the difference
between you and me.

29:54.501 --> 29:56.961
You never did serve your
country, did you, Mr. Walsh?

29:58.963 --> 29:59.881
Get out.

29:59.964 --> 30:01.007
Dad!

30:08.223 --> 30:10.391
{\an3}My clothes
still upstairs?

30:10.475 --> 30:11.559
{\an1}Yeah, why?

30:11.643 --> 30:12.602
{\an3}Do me a favor,
Brandon.

30:12.685 --> 30:14.187
Next time you see
me on the street,

30:14.270 --> 30:16.272
{\an3}pretend you
don't know me.

30:36.125 --> 30:37.752
I'm sorry, Jack.
I didn't think it would

30:37.835 --> 30:38.753
turn out like this.

30:38.836 --> 30:40.088
Ah, it's okay. Forget it.

30:40.171 --> 30:43.132
Listen, let me explain
about my father, okay?

30:45.134 --> 30:46.052
You really hit

30:46.135 --> 30:47.804
a sore spot with him.

30:49.722 --> 30:51.975
{\an3}See... his father
was a Marine.

30:52.058 --> 30:56.604
{\an3}And he wanted my dad to
enlist and go to Vietnam.

30:56.688 --> 31:00.108
{\an3}But my dad was
against the war.

31:00.191 --> 31:03.778
{\an3}They never really
talked much after that.

31:03.861 --> 31:06.114
{\an3}In fact, I never
even met my grandpa.

31:06.197 --> 31:07.198
{\an3}(chuckles)

31:15.582 --> 31:18.418
Listen, Brandon, uh...

31:18.501 --> 31:21.296
forget what I said about
not knowing me on the street.

31:22.213 --> 31:25.008
I'll never forget
your generosity.

31:25.091 --> 31:27.010
You're a good man.

31:30.179 --> 31:31.806
(loud crash)

31:31.889 --> 31:32.557
{\an1}CINDY:
Oh, my Lord!

31:32.640 --> 31:34.601
{\an3}Jim, you'd better
get in here!

31:38.229 --> 31:39.272
What are we gonna do?

31:39.355 --> 31:40.690
Call someone.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.942
Oh, Jim, who are we gonna call
at this time of day

31:43.026 --> 31:44.277
on Thanksgiving?

31:44.360 --> 31:45.653
CANNER:
Got any tarps?

31:45.737 --> 31:47.238
Yeah, in the garage.
How 'bout a ladder?

31:47.322 --> 31:49.991
{\an5}Yeah, that's in the
garage, too.
Well, we better
get up there.

31:50.074 --> 31:52.160
{\an5}On the roof? Now?
In the rain?
Doesn't look like

31:52.243 --> 31:54.871
{\an5}we have much of
a choice, ma'am.
Let's get on it.

31:54.954 --> 31:55.997
{\an1}Come on.
Let's do it.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.291
{\an3}Throw me that
flashlight up here!

31:58.374 --> 32:00.168
(thunder rumbling)

32:02.754 --> 32:04.005
{\an3}You got a lot of
cracked tiles up here.

32:04.088 --> 32:06.674
Soon as this rain lets up,

32:06.758 --> 32:07.258
you're gonna
have to get

32:07.342 --> 32:09.177
a good roofer up here.

32:09.260 --> 32:10.345
Right!

32:10.428 --> 32:13.014
{\an5}Brandon, hand me that plastic.
BRANDON:
You got it.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.433
This has got to be
the weirdest Thanksgiving ever.

32:15.516 --> 32:17.060
Just be careful.

32:17.143 --> 32:18.019
Yes, sir.

32:18.102 --> 32:20.146
Here you go.

32:20.229 --> 32:22.106
{\an5}BRENDA:
It's a good thing
Canner was here.

32:22.190 --> 32:24.692
I can't imagine Dad and Brandon
going up there alone.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.362
Ah, yes, it's strange how
things work out sometimes.

32:30.281 --> 32:32.575
Look, the leak stopped.

32:32.659 --> 32:33.284
(chuckles)

32:35.286 --> 32:37.205
DIRECTOR:
Action.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.714
{\an3}Happy Thanksgiving,
gorgeous.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.175
You, too, Mom.

32:49.258 --> 32:50.885
DIRECTOR:
And cut. Good.

32:50.968 --> 32:52.887
Okay, let's move
to the next setup.

32:52.970 --> 32:56.057
Steve, I need you

32:56.140 --> 32:57.266
to look at your mother,

32:57.350 --> 32:59.060
{\an1}and I need you
to give her

32:59.143 --> 33:03.189
your most heartfelt
Thanksgiving blessing.

33:03.272 --> 33:03.314
Okay?

33:07.318 --> 33:09.320
And... action.

33:14.325 --> 33:17.370
Mom...

33:17.453 --> 33:19.205
on this Thanksgiving,

33:19.288 --> 33:22.291
{\an1}I am especially thankful
for your kindness

33:22.375 --> 33:24.711
and your understanding.

33:24.794 --> 33:28.256
{\an1}And I hope you can find it
within yourself

33:28.339 --> 33:30.550
to be especially kind...

33:32.510 --> 33:34.554
and especially understanding...

33:36.389 --> 33:41.227
...under some rather
unfortunate circumstances.

33:41.310 --> 33:44.564
What circumstances are those,
gorgeous?

33:44.647 --> 33:46.274
{\an1}What are they doing?
We didn't rehearse this.

33:46.357 --> 33:49.277
Just let it roll, this
is a great TV moment.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.988
Mom, I've been looking
for the right...

33:52.071 --> 33:53.156
right time to tell you this.

33:53.239 --> 33:57.285
There just doesn't
seem to be a right time.

33:57.368 --> 34:00.329
Steven, what are you
trying to say?

34:02.415 --> 34:04.292
I got kicked out of school.

34:04.375 --> 34:05.251
What?!

34:05.334 --> 34:08.129
What the hell is he doing?

34:08.212 --> 34:09.255
I can't use this!

34:11.340 --> 34:13.301
I want to speak
with you privately.

34:13.384 --> 34:16.387
{\an3}Now.

34:19.223 --> 34:22.310
So, Dylan, Jack says you're

34:22.393 --> 34:24.437
{\an1}a senior
in high school.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.688
{\an4}Was.
JACK: Christine,
do me a favor.

34:26.773 --> 34:29.650
Convince this boy that there's
nothing cool about dropping out.

34:29.734 --> 34:32.235
Hey, I didn't do it
because I thought it was cool.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.946
Dropping out,
Dylan, why would you want

34:34.030 --> 34:34.739
to do a thing like that?

34:34.822 --> 34:36.282
{\an4}Long story.
JACK:
Boy did too well

34:36.364 --> 34:38.326
on his college boards,
they accused him of cheating.

34:38.409 --> 34:42.205
Oh, like father, like son?

34:42.288 --> 34:43.206
No, actually,

34:43.289 --> 34:44.831
there's a big difference.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.001
The difference being,
I didn't do anything wrong.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.128
Yeah, well,

34:49.212 --> 34:52.340
this cheating fiasco is just
a lot of small-time nonsense.

34:52.422 --> 34:54.675
Well, it doesn't seem like
"small-time" to me.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.219
So take the damn test again.
What's the big deal?

34:56.302 --> 34:57.303
The big deal

34:57.386 --> 35:01.140
is, it's a matter of principle
to me, okay, Jack?

35:01.224 --> 35:02.225
I mean, you're a jailbird,

35:02.308 --> 35:03.226
{\an3}I wouldn't expect you to
know much about principles.

35:03.309 --> 35:05.812
{\an1}Listen, I'm not gonna
sit hear and listen

35:05.895 --> 35:07.688
to your damn insults,
you got that?

35:07.772 --> 35:09.065
Now this damn jailbird's

35:09.148 --> 35:10.274
{\an5}the only father
you've got,
Ah...

35:10.358 --> 35:12.527
{\an1}whether you like it or not.
Stop it, both of you.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.153
Well, I'm not gonna
listen to his crap!

35:14.237 --> 35:15.863
So what're you gonna
do, Jack, walk away?

35:15.947 --> 35:17.114
{\an3}It's what you do
best anyway!

35:19.408 --> 35:22.829
How dare you insult
your father like that!

35:24.247 --> 35:25.373
You think what he's going
through is easy?

35:25.456 --> 35:28.668
I think he brought it
on himself.

35:28.751 --> 35:30.378
{\an1}Yeah, what do you
know about it, Dylan?

35:30.461 --> 35:32.046
Why don't you mind
your own business?

35:32.129 --> 35:34.757
Stop blaming your father

35:34.841 --> 35:37.051
for everything, Dylan,
and stop sulking

35:37.134 --> 35:37.885
{\an1}and get on
with your life.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.345
God knows that's all
Jack's trying to do.

35:39.428 --> 35:42.348
You've got the power here
now, not him,

35:42.431 --> 35:44.725
so stop taking advantage

35:44.809 --> 35:47.103
of the situation.

35:47.186 --> 35:48.354
Give him a break.

35:48.437 --> 35:51.858
Give yourself a break
while you're at it.

35:51.941 --> 35:54.110
How am I supposed to do that?

35:54.193 --> 35:56.612
Go in there and talk to him.

35:58.155 --> 36:00.908
{\an1}Let yourself
have a father.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.285
And let him have a son.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.718
Breaking into the school?

36:18.801 --> 36:20.094
What were you
thinking of?

36:20.177 --> 36:22.138
I'm sorry, I...

36:22.221 --> 36:23.139
{\an3}(sighs)

36:23.222 --> 36:23.931
{\an3}When I get
finished with you,

36:24.015 --> 36:26.267
{\an3}you won't know
what sorry means.

36:26.350 --> 36:28.728
There's more.

36:28.811 --> 36:29.604
{\an3}Wonderful.

36:29.687 --> 36:34.275
What could you have
possibly left out?

36:34.358 --> 36:35.776
You have to come

36:35.860 --> 36:37.278
{\an1}to the school
with me on Monday--

36:37.361 --> 36:38.613
makes it official.

36:38.696 --> 36:40.406
Official?

36:40.489 --> 36:42.992
They throw you out of school
without talking to me first

36:43.075 --> 36:44.118
and <i> I</i> have to make it official?

36:44.201 --> 36:46.829
What is it, some kind
of a ribbon-cutting ceremony?

36:46.913 --> 36:48.289
You have to sign
some papers, I think.

36:48.372 --> 36:50.791
Well, let me tell you

36:50.875 --> 36:51.626
something, Steven.

36:51.709 --> 36:53.544
{\an3}I will not be
signing any papers.

36:53.628 --> 36:56.297
And you will not be
expelled from school

36:56.380 --> 36:59.300
{\an3}like some lowlife
juvenile delinquent.

36:59.383 --> 37:00.509
I am Samantha Sanders,

37:00.593 --> 37:03.971
and you are my son.

37:04.055 --> 37:07.475
And I will not
take this lying down.

37:07.558 --> 37:10.311
I don't think we have
much of a choice.

37:10.394 --> 37:11.979
No.

37:12.063 --> 37:15.149
{\an1}<i>You</i> do not
have a choice.

37:15.232 --> 37:18.027
{\an3}I'm handling this
from now on.

37:18.110 --> 37:18.486
What do you mean?

37:18.569 --> 37:20.488
{\an3}What I mean

37:20.571 --> 37:24.325
is... that I am going
to save your keester

37:24.408 --> 37:26.160
one more time.

37:26.243 --> 37:27.119
{\an1}ALYSSA:
Excuse me.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.454
Uh, Mrs. Sanders,
I'm really sorry,

37:28.537 --> 37:30.957
but if we don't get this shot,
we are going to go

37:31.040 --> 37:31.457
into double time
and I'm gonna get fired.

37:31.540 --> 37:35.294
Of course.

37:35.378 --> 37:36.379
{\an3}Thank you.

37:38.422 --> 37:41.634
You were brilliant.

37:41.717 --> 37:43.719
{\an3}I was?
Yes.

37:44.720 --> 37:45.680
I tell you what.

37:45.763 --> 37:49.308
Why don't you come to my
room tonight about 11:00?

37:49.392 --> 37:52.269
And we could have a Thanksgiving
celebration of our own.

38:02.613 --> 38:05.366
{\an5}BRANDON:
All right, Jack,
that's all tied off.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.451
{\an5}CANNER:
Okay.
Come on, guys, let's go.

38:11.622 --> 38:12.415
JIM: Jack, can
I talk to you?

38:12.498 --> 38:14.542
{\an3}Sure.

38:19.755 --> 38:21.382
Thanks.
If it wasn't for you,

38:21.465 --> 38:23.384
we could've had a real
disaster on our hands.

38:23.467 --> 38:26.053
{\an1}Ah, it's okay, I'm just glad
I could help out.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.222
I'm sorry I lost it in there.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.891
No, that's okay.
You were right.

38:30.975 --> 38:33.060
{\an1}I never should've
walked out on my son.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.478
{\an1}But at the time,
it was the best I could do.

38:35.646 --> 38:39.233
It's not easy, is it?

38:39.317 --> 38:41.110
{\an3}I spent my whole life
trying to be a good father

38:41.193 --> 38:43.362
{\an3}to compensate
for the fact that

38:43.446 --> 38:44.572
my own dad didn't think
I was a very good son.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.076
{\an3}Listen, I can't
talk to my father.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.829
{\an3}He's gone, but, uh... you
still have a chance.

38:52.496 --> 38:56.125
{\an3}Don't make the same
mistake I did.

38:58.461 --> 39:01.047
{\an1}Listen, uh, can I use
your phone?

39:01.130 --> 39:03.215
Yeah.

39:18.397 --> 39:19.774
{\an1}Do you think you have
enough food, David?

39:19.857 --> 39:21.650
It's not like this
is your last meal.

39:25.404 --> 39:26.614
I can't eat.

39:26.697 --> 39:27.615
{\an3}Not when there's people out
there that have nothing.

39:27.698 --> 39:30.076
{\an4}ANDREA:
Donna, you don't
have to feel guilty.

39:30.159 --> 39:31.577
It's not gonna
help anybody.

39:31.660 --> 39:33.079
You know, she's right.

39:33.162 --> 39:34.580
Would you pass
the potatoes, please?

39:34.663 --> 39:35.623
{\an6}BRENDA:
Brandon, you've been
eating all day.

39:35.706 --> 39:38.292
Well, I'm a growing boy,
don't you know?

39:38.375 --> 39:41.712
Oh, good, I was afraid
I held you all up.

39:41.796 --> 39:43.589
{\an3}Oh... why don't you come
sit here next to me?

39:43.672 --> 39:45.633
Thank you.

39:45.716 --> 39:46.801
Is everything all right?

39:46.884 --> 39:49.470
Oh, yeah, everything's
going to be just fine.

39:49.553 --> 39:50.513
Glad to hear that.

39:50.596 --> 39:53.641
Uh, Jim, do you

39:53.724 --> 39:55.559
{\an3}think it'd be all
right if I said grace?

39:57.394 --> 39:59.563
I think that would be fine.

40:07.613 --> 40:09.490
You know, life is-is
very strange.

40:09.573 --> 40:13.494
Most of the time,
we walk around in a daze.

40:13.577 --> 40:14.662
Sometimes we're happy.

40:14.745 --> 40:17.373
Sometimes we're miserable.

40:17.456 --> 40:19.792
Most of the time
we're somewhere in between.

40:19.875 --> 40:22.670
And if you're lucky,
you never get to know

40:22.753 --> 40:25.172
real misery.

40:25.256 --> 40:26.674
{\an3}But for those
of us who have,

40:26.757 --> 40:28.759
{\an3}it's very hard to
keep any kind of faith.

40:30.761 --> 40:32.555
{\an3}But then, something
comes along.

40:32.638 --> 40:34.974
Someone who,

40:35.057 --> 40:38.519
I don't know, makes
us wonder if maybe,

40:38.602 --> 40:40.646
{\an3}just maybe,

40:40.729 --> 40:42.565
{\an3}there's somebody up there
looking out for us.

40:45.151 --> 40:47.611
People talk about the kindness
of strangers,

40:47.695 --> 40:51.240
but, um, you're not strangers.

40:52.491 --> 40:54.535
Not anymore.

41:05.629 --> 41:06.589
{\an1}(groans)

41:06.672 --> 41:08.716
{\an3}Mmm, St. Charles Place,
two hotels.

41:08.799 --> 41:11.010
That's mine and...

41:11.093 --> 41:13.012
{\an3}(whistles)
it's gonna cost you, Jack.

41:13.095 --> 41:14.722
{\an1}(chuckles)

41:14.805 --> 41:16.223
Well, that wipes me out.

41:16.307 --> 41:17.725
{\an1}I can't win
if I can't cheat.

41:17.808 --> 41:21.061
Can't I quit while I'm ahead?
I am really beat.

41:21.145 --> 41:23.731
{\an6}Oh, go ahead, I'm
just gonna sit here
and count my money.

41:23.814 --> 41:25.191
You do that.

41:25.274 --> 41:26.734
{\an6}You know what?
Since I'm feeling
really generous tonight,

41:26.817 --> 41:30.321
{\an3}you guys take my room,
I'll just bunk on the couch.

41:31.780 --> 41:33.407
{\an1}You got any other plans
this evening?

41:33.490 --> 41:33.741
All yours.

41:33.824 --> 41:36.243
I like that.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.329
Thank you.

41:40.831 --> 41:41.749
(sighs)

41:41.832 --> 41:44.710
Why don't you go on in?
I'll be right there.

41:44.793 --> 41:46.295
You got it.

41:47.296 --> 41:48.589
Hey, Dylan.
Huh?

41:48.672 --> 41:49.715
Give me a call sometime.

41:49.798 --> 41:50.758
You can buy me
a megaburger at the Pit.

41:50.841 --> 41:52.843
{\an3}You got it.

41:54.929 --> 41:57.431
(sighs)

41:59.683 --> 42:03.771
Listen, Dylan...

42:03.854 --> 42:06.732
{\an1}I know I can be a pain
in the butt most of the time,

42:06.815 --> 42:10.736
{\an1}but it is damn nice to have
family to come home to,

42:10.819 --> 42:14.823
{\an1}and I just wanted to say,
thank you very much.

42:15.824 --> 42:18.702
It's all right.

42:20.829 --> 42:22.831
Good night.

42:26.043 --> 42:27.586
Good night, Dad.

42:35.552 --> 42:37.554
(dice rattling)

42:57.866 --> 43:00.577
Well, I guess he finally
told his mom.

43:00.661 --> 43:01.829
Yeah.

43:05.582 --> 43:07.793
Steve? Steve, you okay?

43:07.876 --> 43:09.670
{\an3}I had the most
incredible weekend.

43:09.753 --> 43:11.672
What?

43:11.755 --> 43:13.465
I met an awesome girl.

43:13.549 --> 43:14.842
{\an1}SAMANTHA:
Steven! You'll have time

43:14.925 --> 43:16.343
to talk to your friends later.

43:16.427 --> 43:16.802
Sit down!

43:16.885 --> 43:19.263
Hi, Mrs. Sanders.

43:20.681 --> 43:23.058
{\an1}Mrs. Sanders, I've been
expecting you. Please come in.

43:23.142 --> 43:24.518
Thank you.

43:29.064 --> 43:30.858
(sighs)

43:40.784 --> 43:42.870
{\an3}Your mother and I had a very
interesting talk, Steven.

43:42.953 --> 43:44.872
And?

43:44.955 --> 43:47.416
And she's convinced me

43:47.499 --> 43:50.252
to allow you to remain
at West Beverly, on probation.

43:50.336 --> 43:51.837
Which-- if you pass
all your courses--

43:51.920 --> 43:54.381
you might actually graduate
with your class.

43:54.465 --> 43:55.299
That's great.

43:55.382 --> 43:56.884
{\an4}You know, I was
thinking that...
Steven.

43:56.967 --> 43:59.762
{\an6}TEASLEY:
The condition of
your probation is

43:59.845 --> 44:01.847
{\an3}that you're
required to attend

44:01.930 --> 44:04.433
double detention,
which means you'll arrive

44:04.516 --> 44:06.060
at school every morning at 7:15

44:06.143 --> 44:09.897
{\an3}and you will not leave school
until 4:45 every afternoon.

44:09.980 --> 44:14.193
And if you miss one detention,
we <i> will</i> enact the expulsion.

44:17.321 --> 44:18.739
Thank you, Mrs. Teasley.

44:18.822 --> 44:20.657
It's been my pleasure.

44:20.741 --> 44:21.200
Thanks, Mom.

44:21.283 --> 44:22.951
Don't even talk to me.

44:23.035 --> 44:23.952
Thanks, Mrs. Teas...

44:24.036 --> 44:25.913
{\an3}Don't talk
to me, either.

44:29.833 --> 44:31.877
(knocking on window)

44:33.837 --> 44:36.548
(chuckles)

44:36.632 --> 44:37.174
So what's the verdict?

44:37.257 --> 44:39.927
It's a piece of cake, Bran.

44:40.010 --> 44:41.887
You never cease to
amaze me, Sanders.

44:41.970 --> 44:43.013
Don't you forget it.

44:43.097 --> 44:45.391
{\an3}Bren, all the
Thanksgiving sales

44:45.474 --> 44:47.434
{\an3}on Rodeo are still
going on, you want to go?

44:47.518 --> 44:48.811
I can't afford those
clothes at 50% off.

44:48.894 --> 44:50.813
{\an3}Oh, come on, you'll
find something.

44:50.896 --> 44:52.606
{\an3}Or else you'll
just watch me buy.

44:52.689 --> 44:53.816
Oh, that sounds like fun.

44:53.899 --> 44:54.983
{\an6}Come on, I hate
to shop alone...
Hi, Kel.

44:55.067 --> 44:57.027
Hi, Bren. You guys have
a nice Thanksgiving?
