(serene music playing)

00:58.800 --> 01:00.533
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.467
Pussycat, I'm going
out with my friends.

01:07.533 --> 01:08.667
Can you give me some money?

01:08.734 --> 01:10.867
What happened to the money
I gave you last night?

01:10.934 --> 01:16.734
$10 went for cover charge,
$10 went for a round of drinks,

01:16.800 --> 01:18.767
and the other 10
went into the G-string

01:18.834 --> 01:22.233
of a very cute
male dancer named Mr. Big.

01:28.834 --> 01:30.467
I know that guy.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.767
That's just a stage name.

01:36.333 --> 01:40.066
Ma, I don't like this new crowd
that you're hanging out with.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.867
Why are you with these people?

01:41.934 --> 01:43.367
They're the in crowd.

01:43.433 --> 01:46.934
Look, the Senior Citizens' center
has three cliques,

01:47.000 --> 01:50.166
the hip group, the not-so-hip group,
and the broken-hip group.

01:52.066 --> 01:54.600
-Which group would you want to be in?
-When I was a kid,

01:54.667 --> 01:58.867
you always said it wasn't important
to belong to a popular clique.

01:58.934 --> 02:01.000
You always said, "just be yourself."

02:01.066 --> 02:03.000
That's because no one liked you.

02:05.100 --> 02:08.734
This is why when I was a kid,
I had an imaginary mother.

02:10.266 --> 02:11.867
I can't believe it.

02:11.934 --> 02:14.400
Buzz Mueller just called.
He's in town.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.500
Buzz Mueller?

02:15.567 --> 02:18.367
I haven't seen Buzz
in almost 40 years,

02:18.433 --> 02:20.367
since we were dating
in high school.

02:20.433 --> 02:23.867
I didn't think you dated
anyone before Charlie.

02:23.934 --> 02:27.433
Actually,
it was while I dated Charlie.

02:27.500 --> 02:32.066
Rose Nylund, you were in
a love triangle and never told us.

02:32.133 --> 02:33.734
I didn't think
you'd be interested.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.667
But you were certain
we'd be interested

02:35.734 --> 02:37.600
in the story about little Yiminy,

02:37.667 --> 02:40.000
the boy who was raised
by a wild Moose?

02:42.233 --> 02:44.633
May I remind you, Dorothy,

02:44.700 --> 02:47.433
that Moose didn't just
raise little Yiminy.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.734
He put him through
medical school.

02:51.834 --> 02:54.900
Why were you dating
both Buzz and Charlie?

02:54.967 --> 02:57.834
Because I didn't know
which one I liked better.

02:57.900 --> 02:59.834
They were so different.

02:59.900 --> 03:03.200
Charlie liked to do all the typical
teen-age things.

03:03.266 --> 03:06.633
At a drive-in movie,
he'd hide me in the trunk

03:06.700 --> 03:10.233
so we only had to pay
admission for one,

03:10.300 --> 03:13.367
and after the movie,
he'd let me out of the trunk

03:13.433 --> 03:15.467
and tell me all about it.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.367
But I was looking for
someone more exciting.

03:22.433 --> 03:24.400
That's when Buzz came along.

03:24.467 --> 03:29.100
He was St. Olaf's heppest cat,
a musician. You know the type.

03:29.166 --> 03:33.433
He once put a whole box of chiclets
in his mouth on a dare.

03:36.367 --> 03:37.467
Cool.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.967
Well, I almost married Buzz.

03:43.033 --> 03:46.633
We were discussing it when
the Spike Jones band called him.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.700
They needed someone
to make the "whoop" sound

03:48.767 --> 03:50.433
when Spike dropped his pants.

03:52.100 --> 03:55.333
Just before he went to New York,
Buzz said he'd be back,

03:55.400 --> 03:57.266
but I never saw him again.

03:57.333 --> 04:01.300
I waited for a while.
But one gig led to another.

04:01.367 --> 04:03.333
Meanwhile, Charlie and I got closer,

04:03.400 --> 04:05.166
and you know what happened
after that.

04:05.233 --> 04:06.767
Well, did Buzz ever get married?

04:06.834 --> 04:10.300
No, he just traveled the world,
playing his music.

04:10.367 --> 04:13.367
So how did you
finally get over Buzz?

04:13.433 --> 04:16.000
I never really did, entirely.

04:16.066 --> 04:18.567
To this day, whenever
I see a man drop his pants,

04:18.633 --> 04:21.200
some little part of me
wants to go, "whoop!"

04:25.467 --> 04:28.100
I know what you mean.

04:29.700 --> 04:33.800
(mellow music playing)

04:36.367 --> 04:38.200
Ma, we need to talk.

04:40.734 --> 04:44.033
I waited up for you
until 2 in the morning,

04:44.100 --> 04:46.000
and you still weren't home.

04:46.066 --> 04:49.800
Gertie and I and some of the girls
went to Wolfie's to pick up guys.

04:51.867 --> 04:55.633
I called Wolfie's at 11.
You weren't there.

04:55.700 --> 04:58.166
-Guess who got lucky.
-Oh, God!

05:01.400 --> 05:02.533
What can I say?

05:02.600 --> 05:05.166
A couple of egg creams,
the bright fluorescent lights,

05:05.233 --> 05:07.200
and a retired jeweler named Shlomo

05:07.266 --> 05:09.900
all conspired to make
a night of enchantment.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.100
Not for me.

05:13.166 --> 05:16.066
I can't tell you the horrible
thoughts I had

05:16.133 --> 05:17.633
about what might have
happened to you,

05:17.700 --> 05:20.967
although none as horrible as
what you just described.

05:22.934 --> 05:24.667
You're making too much of this.

05:24.734 --> 05:27.467
No, I'm not.
I'm putting my foot down.

05:27.533 --> 05:29.567
I don't like this new crowd.

05:29.633 --> 05:33.000
From now on,
I want you home at 11.

05:35.734 --> 05:37.433
They're my friends,
and I like them.

05:37.500 --> 05:42.000
This is how it will be
as long as you're living with me.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.266
Good morning.

05:44.333 --> 05:46.467
Blanche, I'm giving
you 30 days' notice.

05:46.533 --> 05:48.934
I don't want to live here anymore.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.400
I'm moving.

05:52.166 --> 05:53.967
Don't give it a second thought.

05:54.033 --> 05:55.900
Good morning, ladies.

05:55.967 --> 05:58.433
Hi, Miles.
How was the bird-watching?

05:58.500 --> 06:00.567
Oh, it was thrilling.

06:00.633 --> 06:03.433
Have you ever seen a purple martin
early in the morning?

06:04.633 --> 06:06.200
Yes, I have.

06:10.233 --> 06:11.667
Martin Gelman,

06:11.734 --> 06:15.633
Mr. "Watch me leapfrog over
this parking meter."

06:23.200 --> 06:26.333
Well, Rose, you want to go see
a movie tonight?

06:26.400 --> 06:29.633
Actually,
I'm expecting an old boyfriend.

06:29.700 --> 06:30.867
His name's Buzz Mueller.

06:30.934 --> 06:34.667
I haven't seen him in 40 years,
but if this really bothers you--

06:34.734 --> 06:37.667
Oh, no. I totally understand.

06:37.734 --> 06:41.066
It's too bad. I was going
to take you to see <i>Henry V.</i>

06:41.133 --> 06:42.900
It's just as well.

06:42.967 --> 06:45.033
By the time they get to number five,

06:45.100 --> 06:47.600
those sequels get
pretty predictable.

06:49.333 --> 06:51.567
-Goodbye, Rose.
-Goodbye.

06:54.266 --> 06:56.867
I can't believe you told him that.

06:56.934 --> 06:58.500
But it's true.

06:58.567 --> 07:01.867
Did you doubt for a minute Rocky
was going to beat that Russian?

07:03.433 --> 07:06.834
I mean, didn't you leave out
some important details

07:06.900 --> 07:08.834
about your relationship with Buzz?

07:08.900 --> 07:13.433
No! She did exactly the right thing.
I never tell men about my past.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.633
-Why?
-Takes too long.

07:19.967 --> 07:21.633
(doorbell rings)

07:25.867 --> 07:28.166
-Rose?
-Buzz!

07:28.233 --> 07:29.367
You're blonde.

07:29.433 --> 07:32.433
You let your eyebrows grow back.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.467
-You like them?
-Love them!

07:34.533 --> 07:35.633
Oh!

07:35.700 --> 07:39.133
Oh, you are incredibly beautiful.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.867
Oh, thank you, Buzz.

07:40.934 --> 07:43.467
These are my roommates
Dorothy and Blanche.

07:43.533 --> 07:44.533
Hello there.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.000
Pleased to meet you.

07:46.066 --> 07:49.500
Tell me, Buzz,
is Buzz short for something?

07:49.567 --> 07:54.066
No. Actually, it's not
an unusual name in St. Olaf.

07:54.133 --> 07:57.867
Everybody in my family
is named Buzz.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.367
Buzz and I are going out to lunch.

08:01.433 --> 08:03.500
You're kidding. Buzz is here too?

08:12.500 --> 08:15.300
Sorry, girls. This one's mine.

08:17.166 --> 08:21.333
(soft music playing)

08:24.767 --> 08:27.266
Ma, you're still here.

08:27.333 --> 08:28.633
I thought you were moving.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.367
I will be, smarty-pants.

08:30.433 --> 08:33.700
I found this agency that matches
elderly people with roommates.

08:33.767 --> 08:36.900
(ring)

08:36.967 --> 08:38.233
Hello.

08:38.300 --> 08:40.333
Hi, Miles.

08:40.400 --> 08:43.266
Oh, I'm sorry.
I can't make it tonight.

08:43.333 --> 08:46.467
I have a 24-hour Buzz, bug!

08:49.800 --> 08:52.300
Well, I'll call you tomorrow.

08:52.367 --> 08:54.500
Thanks. Bye-bye.

08:56.667 --> 09:00.133
I should have told him
I have a date with Buzz.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.066
God, I hate me right now.

09:02.133 --> 09:05.800
We finally have something
in common, and I'm moving.

09:07.867 --> 09:10.967
I've never done anything
like this before.

09:11.033 --> 09:15.367
Tell me, is it possible
to love two men at the same time?

09:15.433 --> 09:17.934
Set the scene.
Have we been drinking?

09:25.800 --> 09:28.934
Rose, are you saying
that you love Buzz?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.333
I don't know.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.367
These last few days with him
have been wonderful.

09:33.433 --> 09:34.467
(doorbell rings)

09:34.533 --> 09:38.066
When I'm with him,
it feels like old times.

09:39.600 --> 09:42.000
-Hi, adorable.
-Ladies.

09:46.834 --> 09:48.667
Wow, you're the first
sighted person

09:48.734 --> 09:51.400
I've ever seen
in a suit like that.

09:55.066 --> 09:57.500
I'm wearing this
because the band just rehearsed

09:57.567 --> 09:59.333
for our European tour.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.600
It's a beauty.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.900
Rose, how about some ice cream?

10:02.967 --> 10:04.367
Anyone care to join us?

10:04.433 --> 10:06.667
No. We don't want
to spoil our dinner.

10:06.734 --> 10:10.133
Not that that outfit
hasn't done a good job already.

10:14.600 --> 10:17.500
Buzz, I'm not sure I should go.

10:17.567 --> 10:20.533
You see, I haven't
been totally honest with you.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.567
I'm involved with someone else.

10:22.633 --> 10:25.500
Miles means a lot to me.

10:25.567 --> 10:29.033
I never should've
left you 40 years ago.

10:29.100 --> 10:33.633
I can still see you standing on
the platform as the train rolled by.

10:33.700 --> 10:34.967
Remember, Rose?

10:35.033 --> 10:39.100
You were walking alongside,
tears rolling down your cheeks.

10:39.166 --> 10:42.867
When the train picked up speed,
you started to run.

10:42.934 --> 10:45.600
Suddenly, you were out of sight.

10:45.667 --> 10:47.834
It was very painful for me.

10:47.900 --> 10:49.734
For me too.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.367
I ran face first
into the crossing signal.

10:54.500 --> 10:58.600
Rose...
have dinner with me tonight.

10:58.667 --> 11:01.467
Miles can have you
for the rest of his life,

11:01.533 --> 11:03.667
but I've only got tonight.

11:04.900 --> 11:08.867
Ok, but I don't want you
to stand out in that outfit.

11:08.934 --> 11:11.934
I'll go change into something plaid.

11:14.033 --> 11:17.734
(calm music playing)

11:20.900 --> 11:23.467
-Hi, girls.
-Hi, Rose.

11:23.533 --> 11:26.867
How was dinner with Buzz?

11:26.934 --> 11:28.834
He asked me to go
to Europe with him.

11:31.166 --> 11:33.166
Rose, what about Miles?

11:33.233 --> 11:36.200
I don't know.
I honestly don't know.

11:36.266 --> 11:39.467
For some reason, Buzz just
doesn't want to take Miles with us.

11:45.333 --> 11:48.533
Well, I'm leaving.
I found a compatible roommate.

11:51.266 --> 11:52.633
Here's my new address
and phone number.

11:52.700 --> 11:55.133
Come on, Ma. You're joking.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.700
It's no joke.

11:56.767 --> 12:01.066
<i>Ciao, Auf Wiedersehen,</i>
<i>arrivederci, </i>and <i>sayonara.</i>

12:03.934 --> 12:07.467
Gee, she could have
at least said goodbye.

12:09.200 --> 12:16.233
(serene music playing)

12:18.233 --> 12:19.266
Oh, it's you.

12:19.333 --> 12:23.433
-I thought maybe Sophia came home.
-She'll be back tomorrow.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.633
She's trying to teach me a lesson.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.000
I know my mother.

12:27.066 --> 12:31.333
Oh, really? You said
she wasn't going to leave.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.667
It's not just your mother who left.

12:33.734 --> 12:35.300
I feel like she's my mother too.

12:35.367 --> 12:37.567
I know. Don't worry. She'll be back.

12:37.633 --> 12:40.900
With her gone, who will I go to
in the middle of the night

12:40.967 --> 12:43.633
with my deepest
personal problems?

12:43.700 --> 12:47.700
You went to my mother's room
in the middle of the night?

12:47.767 --> 12:50.867
Many, many times,
two or three times a week.

12:50.934 --> 12:54.233
And she was always
so kind and comforting.

12:54.300 --> 12:55.433
I don't understand.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.166
Every time I'd knock
on her door late at night,

12:58.233 --> 13:02.433
she'd say, "not now,
I'm watching Bob Costas."

13:02.500 --> 13:04.433
Sophia doesn't have
a TV in her room.

13:04.500 --> 13:05.734
I know.

13:08.834 --> 13:10.200
Then after we finished talking,

13:10.266 --> 13:14.133
she'd always give me a piece
of hard candy and a kiss goodnight.

13:15.734 --> 13:18.166
I can't sleep,

13:18.233 --> 13:22.233
and what's worse, I went to Sophia's
room for one of our talks...

13:24.600 --> 13:28.266
and then I remembered she left,
thanks to you, Dorothy.

13:28.333 --> 13:30.600
You had late-night talks
with my mother?

13:30.667 --> 13:31.667
All the time.

13:31.734 --> 13:33.266
And she gave you hard candy?

13:33.333 --> 13:36.800
No. I'd ask, but she was
always afraid I'd choke on it.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.633
We've just gotta get her back.

13:42.700 --> 13:46.500
Oh, don't worry. One sleepless
night in a strange bed,

13:46.567 --> 13:47.400
it'll be enough for her.

13:47.467 --> 13:50.033
In the morning, I'll go talk to her
and bring her back.

13:50.100 --> 13:53.367
Sophia's not the only one with
a sleepless night ahead of her.

13:53.867 --> 13:57.600
To tell you the truth,
I don't know what to do about Buzz.

13:57.667 --> 14:01.433
This might be
a second chance at love.

14:01.500 --> 14:04.367
I'm thinking of going
to Europe with him.

14:04.433 --> 14:07.166
Quite frankly, I don't get it.

14:07.233 --> 14:10.133
What is this hold
Buzz has over you?

14:10.200 --> 14:12.433
I know what she's going through.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.867
First love can be very powerful.

14:14.934 --> 14:17.333
I felt the same way
about Heyward Boyle,

14:17.400 --> 14:20.066
the star pitcher on our high school
baseball team,

14:20.133 --> 14:22.100
an amazing athlete.

14:22.166 --> 14:24.433
That boy had exceptional control.

14:33.433 --> 14:35.900
He was always up for extra innings.

14:39.066 --> 14:42.800
-And his delivery, oh--
-All right, Blanche! Enough!

14:47.533 --> 14:49.834
Yeah. We get it.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.400
So, what was he like in bed?

14:56.100 --> 14:59.834
(mellow music playing)

15:07.166 --> 15:08.233
Good morning, Maria.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.200
Good morning, Mrs. Petrillo.

15:10.266 --> 15:11.900
Did you have trouble sleeping?

15:11.967 --> 15:12.900
No, why?

15:12.967 --> 15:14.166
Well, last night I woke up

15:14.233 --> 15:16.166
and you were sitting on
a chair in my room.

15:16.233 --> 15:17.600
Oh, yeah.

15:17.667 --> 15:21.967
Well, where I used to live,
the bathroom was across the hall.

15:25.867 --> 15:27.734
Sorry, it won't happen again.

15:29.867 --> 15:31.567
Should I draw your bath?

15:31.633 --> 15:34.266
I can draw my own bath.
I can do everything by myself.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.400
Okay, Mrs. Petrillo,
you're the boss.

15:36.467 --> 15:39.133
Look, I'm not the boss.
I'm a poor immigrant from Italy,

15:39.200 --> 15:41.066
and I feel uncomfortable
having somebody

15:41.133 --> 15:43.233
-wait on me hand and foot.
-(doorbell rings)

15:43.300 --> 15:44.600
-I'll get it.
-I'll get it.

15:44.667 --> 15:45.900
Sit.

15:50.834 --> 15:52.533
Oh, my God!

15:52.600 --> 15:54.567
Oh, Dorothy, look at this!

15:54.633 --> 15:55.633
Oh!

15:55.700 --> 15:57.400
What do you want?

15:57.467 --> 15:59.200
We were just
in the neighborhood.

15:59.266 --> 16:02.000
We came by to see
if you need anything.

16:02.066 --> 16:03.934
Obviously, better security.

16:05.700 --> 16:08.433
Oh, the art in this room
is magnificent.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.367
I work in a museum.
I'm an art expert.

16:11.433 --> 16:13.834
Ooh! Look at this Renoir.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.834
Actually, that's a Seurat.

16:15.900 --> 16:18.233
His signature style was pointillism.

16:18.300 --> 16:22.100
Notice how the dots of color
blend together from a distance?

16:22.166 --> 16:23.767
Oh, yeah.

16:26.900 --> 16:28.734
Wanna see the Jackson Pollock
in the John?

16:28.800 --> 16:30.066
I'd love to.

16:30.133 --> 16:32.066
I got to scrub the toilet anyway.

16:38.266 --> 16:39.900
Ma, we have to talk.

16:39.967 --> 16:41.767
There's nothing to talk about.

16:43.367 --> 16:46.000
Oh, here's my roomie.
Hi, Malcolm.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.200
Who's Malcolm?

16:49.266 --> 16:50.266
You are.

16:50.333 --> 16:51.367
Ok.

16:53.567 --> 16:55.967
Ma, he's a man.

16:56.033 --> 16:58.066
I didn't know you
moved in with a man.

16:58.133 --> 17:00.667
What's the difference?
He's over 100 years old.

17:00.734 --> 17:02.767
I'm not sure he knows I'm a woman.

17:04.633 --> 17:08.900
I think Amos and Andy
are on the wireless tonight.

17:08.967 --> 17:12.367
Why don't we stay home
and laugh our asses off?

17:14.233 --> 17:17.934
I told you I'm going out
with the girls tonight.

17:18.033 --> 17:21.633
Yeah, you always were
the ladies' man, Tommy.

17:26.266 --> 17:28.233
Ma, are you happy here?

17:28.300 --> 17:31.300
I live in a palace. I got a maid.

17:31.367 --> 17:32.900
A dream come true.

17:32.967 --> 17:35.900
I want you to come home.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.400
I miss you. We all miss you.

17:38.467 --> 17:41.667
We're your family,
and you belong with us.

17:41.734 --> 17:43.333
Can I still hang out
with my friends?

17:43.400 --> 17:44.300
No.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.800
Wrong answer.

17:46.867 --> 17:48.266
I'm not being arbitrary.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.033
I'm worried about you.

17:50.100 --> 17:51.934
Your friends are in their 80s.

17:52.033 --> 17:55.300
You're driving at night,
sometimes in bad weather.

17:55.367 --> 17:59.166
You eat spicy food at restaurants,
then you're sick for three days.

17:59.233 --> 18:01.533
Sorry. I can't say yes.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.367
-Bye.
-Ma!

18:05.000 --> 18:06.333
Ma!

18:06.400 --> 18:08.433
You must be Tommy's boy.

18:11.467 --> 18:14.100
How does the team
look this year?

18:15.700 --> 18:20.367
(soft music playing)

18:20.433 --> 18:22.567
(doorbell rings)

18:22.633 --> 18:23.834
Coming.

18:27.367 --> 18:31.133
-Miles, what are you doing here?
-Rose, I want the truth.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.834
Is something going on
between you and Buzz?

18:33.900 --> 18:36.433
Yes, there's something going on.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.400
I'm just not sure what it is.

18:41.233 --> 18:43.333
(doorbell rings)

18:43.400 --> 18:45.867
There's someone at the door.

18:45.934 --> 18:47.500
(ring)

18:47.567 --> 18:49.800
Aren't you going
to answer the door?

18:54.500 --> 18:55.667
Hi, cutie.

18:57.834 --> 18:59.500
Hello.

18:59.567 --> 19:01.133
Buzz, this is Miles.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.734
Miles, Buzz.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.000
So you're Buzz.

19:06.467 --> 19:08.066
So you're Miles.

19:09.667 --> 19:11.233
You're Buzz.

19:13.266 --> 19:15.433
You're Miles.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.567
Ha. Buzz.

19:18.734 --> 19:20.000
Miles.

19:21.967 --> 19:22.900
Rose.

19:22.967 --> 19:24.166
Huh?

19:24.667 --> 19:25.700
Oh.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.734
Rose, I'd like to talk
to you alone.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.200
I'm sure Buzz won't mind.

19:32.266 --> 19:35.100
I'll wait out on the <i>lanai,</i>
pumpkin.

19:39.266 --> 19:40.400
So...

19:41.900 --> 19:45.033
Is this the end of the road for us,
pumpkin?

19:45.100 --> 19:47.066
Oh, Miles, can't you see?

19:47.133 --> 19:49.533
I'm overwhelmed. I'm confused.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.900
I don't know what
I'm doing anymore.

19:51.967 --> 19:53.266
Fine.

19:53.333 --> 19:55.667
Let me help make it easy for you.

19:55.734 --> 19:58.066
Dump Buzz.

19:58.133 --> 19:59.800
I know it's asking a lot.

19:59.867 --> 20:02.233
I need time to figure this out.

20:02.300 --> 20:05.033
Ok, I understand.

20:05.100 --> 20:08.967
It's just that the thought
of losing you scares me.

20:09.033 --> 20:11.867
I love you, damn it.
I want us to be together.

20:14.033 --> 20:16.066
We should be together
because we want to be,

20:16.133 --> 20:18.834
not because I boxed you
into a corner with an ultimatum.

20:20.633 --> 20:23.233
Take all the time you need.

20:23.300 --> 20:24.700
I'll be waiting.

20:30.600 --> 20:31.633
Coast clear?

20:31.700 --> 20:32.900
Yeah.

20:32.967 --> 20:35.400
Buzz, I've been thinking.

20:35.467 --> 20:38.600
Let's spend some time getting
to know each other

20:38.667 --> 20:40.900
before we rush off to Europe.

20:40.967 --> 20:43.367
I know all I need to know.

20:43.433 --> 20:46.100
If you need more time,

20:46.166 --> 20:48.600
I'll go to Europe,
do what I have to do,

20:48.667 --> 20:50.166
then come back for you.

20:50.233 --> 20:52.266
That's what you
told me 40 years ago.

20:52.333 --> 20:54.500
You never came back.

20:54.567 --> 20:58.667
But you got married. We both
made mistakes. We're even.

20:58.734 --> 21:01.433
I don't think I made a mistake.

21:01.500 --> 21:05.133
I wouldn't trade my time
with Charlie for anything.

21:05.200 --> 21:11.100
I'm glad I didn't wait for you then,
and I won't wait for you this time.

21:11.600 --> 21:15.734
Well, then...
I guess I better get going.

21:17.533 --> 21:20.066
Get your hands off my woman!

21:20.133 --> 21:22.934
Don't hit me.
Don't hit me.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.500
I'm in the Arts.

21:27.333 --> 21:29.767
-Miles.
-I'm not finished, Rose.

21:29.834 --> 21:31.400
I take back everything.

21:31.467 --> 21:34.800
I won't sit around
eating my heart out.

21:34.867 --> 21:36.500
I want you to stop seeing Buzz!

21:36.567 --> 21:38.567
-Okey-dokey.
-Because if you don't...

21:40.867 --> 21:42.467
I'm sorry. What did you say?

21:42.533 --> 21:43.934
I said okey-dokey.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.166
Okey...

21:48.166 --> 21:50.767
okey...
I can't believe it.

21:50.834 --> 21:52.667
After all these years
of being sensitive,

21:52.734 --> 21:55.700
I barge in here
like some macho jerk

21:55.767 --> 21:57.767
and I get exactly what I want.

21:57.834 --> 22:01.667
Oh, Miles, I find this side of you
very exciting.

22:03.066 --> 22:06.133
Well, it's the jungle cat in me.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.800
I try to keep it carefully hidden,
of course.

22:08.867 --> 22:10.367
(growls)

22:16.400 --> 22:18.700
Oh, my God. Now she's with
the other boyfriend.

22:18.767 --> 22:20.600
It's like living with Cher.

22:25.834 --> 22:26.700
Ma.

22:26.767 --> 22:29.800
Sophia, you're here,
and you have your suitcase.

22:29.867 --> 22:31.533
Are you moving back?

22:31.600 --> 22:32.533
I don't get it.

22:32.600 --> 22:35.567
I'm gone a while, and the
dumb one's acting like a slut

22:35.633 --> 22:38.300
while the slut's being stupid.

22:40.934 --> 22:42.233
Of course, I'm back.

22:42.300 --> 22:46.367
Oh, Ma, it's so good
to have you home.

22:46.433 --> 22:47.767
I was wrong.

22:47.834 --> 22:52.266
I have no right to tell you how to
live or who your friends should be.

22:52.333 --> 22:53.934
You're obviously
doing something right.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.900
You've made it to 83.

22:55.967 --> 22:59.900
I guess it's just me
trying to hold on to you.

22:59.967 --> 23:02.867
No. You were right, Dorothy.

23:02.934 --> 23:04.567
I was with the wrong crowd.

23:06.467 --> 23:09.934
By the way, if anyone asks,
I was here last night.

23:19.300 --> 23:23.133
(theme music playing)
