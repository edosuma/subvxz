WEBVTT

00:08.076 --> 00:09.577
(chuckles)

00:09.610 --> 00:12.580
Dad, praying mantis!

00:12.613 --> 00:14.715
Oh, and it's a biggie.

00:16.584 --> 00:19.820
Dad, Dad, I found
a praying mantis.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.089
Now we finally have
something to fight

00:21.122 --> 00:22.123
that beetle
we've been saving.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.657
What are you doing
back here, Jimmy?

00:23.691 --> 00:25.226
That dog doesn't know you.
He'll kill you.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.430
Why is your shirt off?

00:29.463 --> 00:31.565
I was hot.
It's not that
hot today.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.234
Well, I was working,
and working made me sweat.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.835
You're dry,
and your nipples are hard.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.405
Your obsession
with my moisture and nipples

00:37.438 --> 00:39.273
is making me
uncomfortable.

00:39.307 --> 00:41.175
Plus, I think
it's pissing off the dog.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.177
Please just go
finish the front.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.478
It's just weird.

01:02.230 --> 01:03.664
Morning, Burt.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.500
I brought you
a slice of pound cake.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.336
Oh, I don't know
what's sweeter--

01:08.369 --> 01:09.637
you or that pound cake.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.106
(both chuckling)

01:12.140 --> 01:14.408
You know why they
call it pound cake?

01:14.442 --> 01:16.377
'Cause if you eat it,
you gain a pound.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.479
(both laugh)

01:18.512 --> 01:20.214
Or two pounds.
(laughs)

01:20.248 --> 01:22.683
Hey, hey, hey, three.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.285
(laughing)
Three.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.187
Mmm.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.521
(laughter)

01:31.692 --> 01:34.528
* Whoo!

01:34.562 --> 01:39.467
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
Daddy-o, oh, oh, oh *

01:39.500 --> 01:42.836
* Birth control, no, no, no

01:42.870 --> 01:46.307
* Let it roll, oh, oh, oh

01:46.340 --> 01:48.909
* Oh

01:48.942 --> 01:52.480
* Oh...

01:52.513 --> 01:57.551
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

02:00.454 --> 02:03.157
I'm not going to be
around forever,

02:03.191 --> 02:04.692
and I want
your little baby girl

02:04.725 --> 02:06.394
to have this, so she'll

02:06.427 --> 02:08.329
always remember who her...

02:08.362 --> 02:10.598
Who am I to her again?

02:10.631 --> 02:12.466
You're her great-great-maw maw.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.635
That is so sweet.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.270
Oh, I wonder what it is

02:16.304 --> 02:19.273
that makes me so great.

02:19.307 --> 02:20.474
BURT (chuckling):
Well, hey, sweetie.

02:20.508 --> 02:23.511
Don't you look glamorous?

02:23.544 --> 02:25.313
Boy, you just never
turn off the charm, do you?

02:25.346 --> 02:26.547
Here, why don't
you see

02:26.580 --> 02:27.781
if you can get
the Indian woman on the butter

02:27.815 --> 02:28.916
to blow you a kiss?

02:28.949 --> 02:30.784
Okay, we need to talk.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.220
Yes, you're damn right
we need to talk.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.421
What were you doing
with that lady today?

02:33.454 --> 02:34.788
Nothing.
Oh, come on.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.424
You had your shirt off,

02:36.457 --> 02:40.261
you were doing push-ups,
smiling with your mouth all...

02:40.294 --> 02:41.662
I wasn't doing that.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.697
I was doing this.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.466
- That's what I did.
- No, you did it all pervy.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.800
You were like...

02:46.834 --> 02:47.768
That's what you were doing.

02:47.801 --> 02:48.869
I was not.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.371
My mouth doesn't
even work that way.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.440
Tell me, are you trying
to sleep with that woman?

02:52.473 --> 02:53.907
Trying to sleep with what woman?

02:53.941 --> 02:55.343
With no woman.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.877
Jimmy saw a side

02:56.910 --> 02:59.780
of the business today that
I've sort of shielded him from.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.081
He's just trying to wrap
his brain around it.

03:01.114 --> 03:04.485
Well, now I'm trying to wrap
my brain around it, Burt.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.453
What did he see?

03:05.486 --> 03:06.854
BURT:
Uh...

03:06.887 --> 03:10.924
you know, there was a
client, she was a lady,

03:10.958 --> 03:13.361
I take my shirt off, stuff
like that, like you do.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.564
Happy now, Chicken Little?

03:16.597 --> 03:18.232
Sky's not falling.

03:18.266 --> 03:21.835
You took your shirt off
so she will look at you?

03:21.869 --> 03:25.806
Yeah.
I'm the pool guy.

03:25.839 --> 03:28.309
Oh, come on, Virginia,
don't act so naive.

03:28.342 --> 03:31.545
("I Want Candy"
by Bow Wow Wow playing)

03:31.579 --> 03:34.515
Everybody knows
the lawn and pool business

03:34.548 --> 03:37.318
isn't just about lawns
and pools.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.387
* I know a guy
who's tough but sweet... *

03:39.420 --> 03:41.855
Over the years I've learned
people want a little eye candy.

03:41.889 --> 03:46.360
* He's so fine,
he can't be beat *

03:46.394 --> 03:49.730
* He's got everything
that I desire *

03:49.763 --> 03:52.266
* Sets the summer sun
on fire... *

03:52.300 --> 03:54.868
And I got candy to give.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.405
* I want candy...

03:57.438 --> 03:59.473
Come holiday bonus time,

03:59.507 --> 04:03.777
we're lucky some customers have
a serious sweet tooth.

04:03.811 --> 04:06.714
* I want candy

04:08.449 --> 04:11.018
* I want candy...

04:11.051 --> 04:12.920
There's no physical contact.

04:12.953 --> 04:16.490
I'm not selling my body,
just selling the dream.

04:16.524 --> 04:18.726
* Hey!

04:18.759 --> 04:22.430
* Hey!
Who are you--
Burt Bigalow: Lawn Gigolo?

04:22.463 --> 04:25.433
I want you to have
my father's top hat.

04:25.466 --> 04:29.603
I'd rather...
Wear the top
hat, Burt.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.972
Wear it, then maybe you can
dig up Abe Lincoln's wife

04:32.005 --> 04:33.006
and flirt with her.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.880
Look, I'm just using

04:39.913 --> 04:41.515
my God-given gifts
to provide for my family.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.617
I won this
in a dance marathon.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.085
Thank you.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.421
Burt, don't act like
you're doing this for us.

04:47.455 --> 04:49.857
The truth is, you just
love being a sex symbol.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.425
It's not about that.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.961
It's about putting
food on the table.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.363
When it comes to being
a hunter-gatherer,

04:55.396 --> 04:56.597
I don't have
a lot of weapons.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.965
I'm not that bright,
I'm not that smart,

04:57.998 --> 04:59.099
and I don't have
a lot of intelligence,

04:59.132 --> 05:02.503
so believe me, I know how
lucky I am to have these guns.

05:04.372 --> 05:06.640
Really, Burt, the guns?

05:06.674 --> 05:07.908
Ah, who am I kidding?

05:07.941 --> 05:11.345
My real trophy is
my four-pack abs.
(groans)

05:11.379 --> 05:12.646
Call the police.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.048
A crook has stolen
everything from my room.

05:15.082 --> 05:18.051
Everything that is
precious to me is gone.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.432
So Burt flirted
with a woman?

05:31.465 --> 05:32.633
Who cares?

05:32.666 --> 05:34.034
Everybody flirts;
I do it all the time.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.936
You're kidding me.
And Donovan doesn't care?

05:35.969 --> 05:37.037
No, he does it, too.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.005
And you don't care?

05:38.038 --> 05:39.640
When Donovan flirts

05:39.673 --> 05:42.743
and I see a woman flirt back,
it kind of turns me on--

05:42.776 --> 05:45.078
unless she touches him,
and then I'll beat her ass,

05:45.112 --> 05:47.548
which always turns him on,

05:47.581 --> 05:48.849
so when he flirts,
one way or another,

05:48.882 --> 05:50.584
somebody's getting
turned on,

05:50.618 --> 05:51.852
which is a good thing
in a marriage.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.621
You should try it.

05:53.654 --> 05:54.688
Oh, no, I don't think I...

05:54.722 --> 05:55.723
Don't think.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.157
Do.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.460
Okay, well...

06:00.794 --> 06:03.130
That bra really makes
your boobs look perky.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.865
Not on me.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.033
The waiter.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.901
Oh, no, I
couldn't.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.903
Hey, Gary...

06:09.937 --> 06:11.171
(chuckles)

06:11.204 --> 06:13.841
...uh, is that an
inspirational stone

06:13.874 --> 06:15.943
in your pocket or are you
just happy to see me?

06:15.976 --> 06:17.411
(laughs)

06:17.445 --> 06:18.679
Oh, it's a stone.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.148
It says "Destiny."

06:21.181 --> 06:23.584
I like to believe
that there's something great

06:23.617 --> 06:25.519
out there waiting for me.
You know?

06:25.553 --> 06:27.855
Well, who knows?

06:27.888 --> 06:30.658
Maybe you could be waiter
to the President someday.

06:30.691 --> 06:33.160
Yeah.
You're sure
handsome enough.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.830
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

06:36.864 --> 06:40.133
Hey, you know, um, I just took
some scones out of the oven.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.835
Why don't I bring you ladies
a couple on the house?

06:43.804 --> 06:45.606
Oh, my God, I did it.

06:45.639 --> 06:46.640
You did it.

06:46.674 --> 06:47.741
Ah, I did it.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.479
What the hell is a scone?

06:58.952 --> 07:02.590
Hey, do you think I could
pull these earrings off,
or is it too busy?

07:03.591 --> 07:04.658
Jimmy!
Huh?

07:06.527 --> 07:08.629
Oh, yeah, that's,
that's really funny.

07:08.662 --> 07:11.565
You still preoccupied
about your parents?

07:11.599 --> 07:15.102
We both are, okay?
It's a big deal.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.704
You mentioned it Tuesday,
and it stuck with me.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.038
Oh.

07:18.071 --> 07:21.108
Parents don't realize
the scars they leave.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.510
Dude, cut it out.

07:22.543 --> 07:23.611
You're getting fish
guts in my neck hole.

07:23.644 --> 07:24.578
You know, I don't
know why your mom's

07:24.612 --> 07:27.648
so bummed out about this
whole flirting thing.

07:27.681 --> 07:28.816
Everybody does it.
It's fun.

07:28.849 --> 07:29.683
It's a good way
to get what you want.

07:29.717 --> 07:31.885
Whoa, whoa, you do it, too?
Oh, yeah.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.987
It's how I get Barney to
give me all the easy jobs.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.188
You know I work from
home on Thursdays?

07:36.690 --> 07:38.859
That is so unfair.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.127
It's just the way the
world works, Jimmy.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.862
You use what you got.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.864
Is it fair that I missed
the height requirement

07:43.897 --> 07:45.666
for America's Next Top
Model by 12 inches?

07:46.734 --> 07:48.168
Stop.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.103
I washed my hands.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.914
Hey, Burt,
awfully hot,
don't you think?

08:03.050 --> 08:04.818
Don't worry,
I've increased your chlorine

08:04.852 --> 08:07.688
to compensate
for the heat-induced algae.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.590
I meant your clothes.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.959
You're wearing
a lot of clothes.

08:11.992 --> 08:16.263
I also added muriatic acid,
so your pH is...

08:16.296 --> 08:17.931
My wife knows about us.

08:17.965 --> 08:18.966
What about us?

08:18.999 --> 08:20.601
Everything--
I came clean,

08:20.634 --> 08:22.035
told her all
about our flirting.

08:22.069 --> 08:25.072
Flirting? We were
just being friendly.

08:25.105 --> 08:29.076
Oh, come on--
the suggestive banter,
the pound cake,

08:29.109 --> 08:33.213
me topless skimming,
you doing slow karate
on that mat.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.749
I think we both crossed
the friendly line,

08:35.783 --> 08:38.586
and I was flirting
and it has to end.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.087
So no more pound cake?

08:40.120 --> 08:41.521
No more pound cake.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.707
(exhales)

08:59.740 --> 09:01.642
(grunts)

09:02.943 --> 09:05.713
Oh, man, these things
sure are the dickens.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.347
Oh, I couldn't have
said it better myself.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.348
Oh, here, let me,
let me give it a try.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.117
Well, thanks.

09:10.150 --> 09:13.587
I didn't expect
that from the boss.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.923
Whoa, that is a
lot of firepower

09:15.956 --> 09:16.990
you've got in
those guns.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.659
Oh, yeah, well, I--

09:18.692 --> 09:20.160
I've got some free weights
in my office.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.662
Wow, you're not
bulky either.

09:21.695 --> 09:22.663
You're strong
but you're lean.

09:22.696 --> 09:23.764
I mean, that's
the kind of body

09:23.797 --> 09:25.098
I want to have
when I'm 29.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.668
Ah, thanks, though I'm
a little bit older than 29,

09:27.701 --> 09:28.836
but not by much.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.738
Boy, I wish
I knew your tricks.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.640
Oh, why don't I show you
my workout routine?

09:32.673 --> 09:34.207
We can do it right now.
Oh, I'd love that,

09:34.241 --> 09:37.010
but I'm supposed to de-moth
some of the light fixtures.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.046
Ah, those moths
aren't going anywhere.

09:39.079 --> 09:42.015
(laughing):
Oh, man, the "moths
aren't going anywhere."

09:42.049 --> 09:43.050
That's hilarious.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.117
Well, the moths can't move,

09:44.151 --> 09:45.919
because they're dead.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.121
(laughing):
Ah, yep.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.890
Strong and funny.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.925
Mothers, lock up
your daughters.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.197
Eh, what's all this?

09:57.230 --> 09:58.331
I just picked up some
"reduced for quick sale"

09:58.365 --> 10:00.100
lunch meat
at the gas station.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.970
I know, I know, I was angry,
so I didn't cook for a week,

10:03.003 --> 10:05.338
but now I want to apologize.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.307
You do?
I was wrong.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.277
I was all crazy
about you flirting.

10:10.310 --> 10:13.647
Then I had lunch with Sylvia,
and she explained to me

10:13.681 --> 10:15.048
that everybody flirts,

10:15.082 --> 10:17.918
so I tried it with the
waiter and it worked.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.419
Gary gave me
all this free food.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.221
Gary-- You call him Gary?

10:21.254 --> 10:23.023
Yes, he told me
his name is Gary,

10:23.056 --> 10:25.125
but his full name is
also on his name tag--

10:25.158 --> 10:26.694
Gary Barista.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.329
I am starving.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.164
I didn't realize what
hard work flirting is.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.199
With Sabrina?

10:32.232 --> 10:34.101
No, even better.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.969
("Feels Like the First Time"
by Foreigner playing)

10:36.003 --> 10:37.437
* It feels
like the first time... *

10:37.470 --> 10:39.807
(exhales)

10:39.840 --> 10:41.274
* Feels like the very
first time... *

10:41.308 --> 10:43.677
Wow, this is harder
than I thought.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.045
That's what she said.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.680
What?
That's just
a joke

10:46.714 --> 10:48.215
a guy on a TV show
I used to watch says.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.983
Oh.

10:50.017 --> 10:52.252
Oh, ha-ha-ha,
oh, that's hilarious.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.988
It makes it seem like I said
something dirty, but I didn't.

10:58.025 --> 11:00.794
* Spend my time
so foolishly... *

11:00.828 --> 11:01.995
Foreigner is
pretty great, huh?

11:02.029 --> 11:03.463
They're awesome.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.898
I don't believe this.

11:04.932 --> 11:06.299
Everybody's flirting but me.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.301
Does this mean
flirting's back on?

11:08.335 --> 11:10.437
'Cause I would really
like to reopen my flirt
gates-- I miss it.

11:10.470 --> 11:11.705
Flirt away.

11:11.739 --> 11:12.806
Great!

11:12.840 --> 11:14.441
Jimmy, grab my razor.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.376
We got a neck to shave!

11:17.945 --> 11:19.112
Morning.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.882
Nice shorts.

11:21.915 --> 11:25.886
Not a lot of guys can pull off
the shorts and dark socks.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.856
Hey. I got some
detergent samples
in my bag.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.291
They're addressed to
"Resident." Interested?

11:33.060 --> 11:35.328
I'm a resident somewhere.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.901
Knock, knock.

11:40.934 --> 11:43.136
Knock Knock Knock.
Maid Service.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.205
MAN:
Down the hall and to your left.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.444
Mmm...

11:51.478 --> 11:52.746
Whoa!

11:52.780 --> 11:55.282
Oh! Um...

11:55.315 --> 11:57.818
Ah, oh, I think there's
been a mistake here.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.887
We're a legitimate
cleaning service.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.389
You called
Knock Knock Knock.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.991
I think you wanted
Knock Knock Nooky.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.525
Happens all the time.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.827
I think I have their
number in here somewhere.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.996
Virginia... it's me.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.799
Gary Barista?

12:13.867 --> 12:15.335
That's not the name
that's on here.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.043
Gary, I think you took
what I said the other day

12:23.076 --> 12:24.211
the wrong way.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.815
No. You're my destiny.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.149
I was just flirting.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.819
I am sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression,

12:31.852 --> 12:34.254
but I'm a married woman.
Hey,

12:34.287 --> 12:36.123
(phone ringing)
we all have baggage.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.791
Believe me,

12:37.825 --> 12:39.960
I have way too close
a relationship with my mother.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.829
Hi, Mom. Um, she's thinking
about it right now,

12:41.862 --> 12:43.396
so can you call back
in, like, ten?

12:43.430 --> 12:45.265
I am not thinking about it.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.235
I know you won't leave!

12:48.268 --> 12:49.569
Fate won't
let you leave.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.238
You are about to walk
right back in this room.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.876
You're about to walk
back in this apartment!

12:58.879 --> 13:00.213
There you are.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.883
I also have a coupon
for some free panties.

13:02.916 --> 13:06.486
Oh, my God,
I did it again.

13:06.519 --> 13:09.389
GARY: You're about to
walk back in this building!

13:11.424 --> 13:14.427
You're on trout-cleaning duty.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.063
Big shipment
just came in.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.265
I don't clean fish.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.400
Never have, never will.
Now, go ask Barney.

13:20.433 --> 13:23.370
I don't have to ask him,
'cause you're not my boss.

13:23.403 --> 13:26.206
My boss is the well-groomed,
tiny-handed man

13:26.239 --> 13:29.542
who told me to tell you
to clean the trout.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.948
(laughter)

13:34.982 --> 13:37.250
Mm. Mm.
Mm!

13:37.284 --> 13:41.121
This is the most
passionate passion fruit
iced tea I've ever had.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.056
Well, making it
is my passion.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.624
Barney?
(laughing)
Oh! Oh, man...

13:44.657 --> 13:46.526
Uh...

13:46.559 --> 13:51.131
those patriotic nut jobs are
picketing the hummus again.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.234
When will they learn that
chickpeas are not our enemies?

13:54.267 --> 13:56.937
(sighs)

13:56.970 --> 13:58.338
Two can play at that
flirting game, Sabrina.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.307
Oh, really?
Well, don't get

14:00.340 --> 14:02.442
too comfy in my
Snuggie, Chance.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.444
(whispers):
Nobody steals my man!

14:04.477 --> 14:06.546
I can't go out there
without this.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.192
Burt.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.460
What are you
doing here?

14:20.493 --> 14:22.329
Well, my wife said
she's totally cool

14:22.362 --> 14:23.997
with what we were doing.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.632
So the flirt train
is back on track.

14:25.665 --> 14:27.367
Whoo-whoo!

14:27.400 --> 14:29.436
Really?

14:29.469 --> 14:30.570
Okay.

14:33.306 --> 14:36.143
Whoo-whoo!

14:36.176 --> 14:39.379
So, um...

14:39.412 --> 14:41.081
it's really hot
out here today.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.315
Oh, yeah, we're-we're done
with the train thing?

14:42.349 --> 14:44.084
I think so.
Okay.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.153
Uh, yeah, it's really hot.

14:46.186 --> 14:47.520
It might be a record.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.322
Mmm!

14:49.356 --> 14:51.691
You want me to drink
out of the hose
or something?

14:51.724 --> 14:53.526
Okay. I'll turn it on for you.

14:59.499 --> 15:00.700
(grunts)

15:00.733 --> 15:02.669
It's still kind of hot.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.104
(chuckles)

15:07.174 --> 15:08.675
Oh, that's coppery.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.312
You're kind of coppery.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.580
(awkward chuckle)

15:13.613 --> 15:16.083
I'm sorry, forget it.
I can't do this.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.351
I know.
Now that we've talked
about it, it just feels...

15:18.385 --> 15:19.519
Disgusting.

15:24.992 --> 15:26.359
(Virginia stammers)

15:26.393 --> 15:28.728
Oh, no, that's
Grandma juice, baby.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.430
(knocking at door)

15:34.267 --> 15:36.203
What the hell?

15:36.236 --> 15:38.338
Virginia, you remember
Gary from the cafe?

15:38.371 --> 15:41.174
Sure. Gary, nice to see ya...

15:41.208 --> 15:42.976
dressed.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.311
Wha...?!

15:44.344 --> 15:45.678
Why did you bring him here?

15:45.712 --> 15:47.280
Well, I stopped
by the coffee shop

15:47.314 --> 15:49.082
to get a scone,
and Gary was crying,

15:49.116 --> 15:50.383
going on and
on about you

15:50.417 --> 15:52.119
with that sad
little face of his,

15:52.152 --> 15:53.620
and he wouldn't
let me leave!

15:53.653 --> 15:55.222
Eventually, I
realized that if

15:55.255 --> 15:57.090
I brought him here,
he'd be your problem.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.326
No. You are not leaving me
alone with that nut job.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.202
(chuckling)

16:09.236 --> 16:10.670
Oh, hey.

16:10.703 --> 16:13.006
You guys enjoy
your second TV break?
Yeah.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.474
Ice Road Truckers.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.143
Man, I can't believe
you were brave enough

16:16.176 --> 16:17.777
to go through
with that once.
Oh, well,

16:17.810 --> 16:20.380
it was really more of
a flower delivery van
in Topeka, Kansas.

16:20.413 --> 16:21.514
But the roads did
get pretty slick.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.183
(chuckles)
Oh, you know what, Barney,

16:23.216 --> 16:25.252
actually, this
came for you earlier.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.419
Oh, super.

16:26.453 --> 16:27.254
Hm.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.657
"Dear Mr. Hughes,
Congratulations

16:30.690 --> 16:33.760
"on being named winner
of MTV's Find the
Coolest Boss contest.

16:33.793 --> 16:34.794
You didn't.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.063
"Enclosed is

16:36.096 --> 16:37.430
"a $20 gift certificate

16:37.464 --> 16:39.432
"to TJ Muckracker's,
Home of

16:39.466 --> 16:41.668
"the Deep-Dish Onion
Ring, for you to share
with the employee

16:41.701 --> 16:43.603
who nominated you,
Sabrina Collins."

16:43.636 --> 16:46.439
Oh, my God, they told me
it was gonna be anonymous.

16:46.473 --> 16:49.676
Well, looks like you
and I have a date to go
to TJ Muckracker's tonight.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.578
Barney, I love that place!

16:51.611 --> 16:54.181
Oh, except you know what?
I'm scheduled to close.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.249
Oh, don't worry, uh, Jimmy
can stay and close up tonight.

16:56.283 --> 16:57.550
But I'm off at 6:00.
Good,

16:57.584 --> 17:00.087
then you can stay and devein
the shrimp until 9:00.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.721
I am gonna
call my ex-wife.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.356
I'll be Perfect Doug
doesn't have

17:03.390 --> 17:05.725
a plaque that says "MTV's
Coolest Hedge Fund Manager."

17:05.758 --> 17:07.094
(giggles)
Okay,

17:07.127 --> 17:08.595
you've won this
round, Collins.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.830
But you can't get Barney
a plaque every week.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.466
Well, my uncle owns
Discount Trophies and
Plaques, so actually I can.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.735
Oh, um, this came for you.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.173
BARNEY:
Well, apparently, Perfect Doug

17:20.207 --> 17:22.775
has several plaques
and a baby on the way.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.677
Let's go get drunk.

17:31.351 --> 17:32.719
Hi, Sylvia.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.354
Oh! I was just waiting
for you to get here

17:34.387 --> 17:35.755
so I can leave.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.291
Maw Maw keeps saying
I stole from her.

17:38.325 --> 17:39.426
Check her purse.

17:39.459 --> 17:42.429
I know she's got
my treasures!

17:42.462 --> 17:45.064
It's taken all I've got
not to slap her.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.635
I'm sure somewhere out there
there's a woman

17:48.668 --> 17:51.604
who wants to be lured into your
apartment to find you naked.

17:51.638 --> 17:54.541
Maybe you should
try Gregslist.

17:57.377 --> 17:58.611
VIRGINIA (whispers):
Hey.

17:58.645 --> 18:01.314
Remember that guy
I told you I flirted with,

18:01.348 --> 18:02.482
Gary the waiter?

18:02.515 --> 18:04.751
Well, now he's
Gary the stalker.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.819
So thanks
for encouraging
me to flirt.

18:06.853 --> 18:09.189
Well, exactly what did
you say when you flirted?

18:09.222 --> 18:11.458
I don't know,
just nice things.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.227
(sniffs)
Oh!

18:14.261 --> 18:15.895
Damn, son.
What is that smell?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.797
The poop of 800 shrimps.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.667
It's no use. Sabrina's just
way better at flirting than me.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.236
You two should have left the
flirting to a professional.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.572
Without the proper technique,
it can be a very dangerous game.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.175
You wait here,
I'll go take care of Gary,

18:28.208 --> 18:30.543
and you-- oh, man, you reek--

18:30.577 --> 18:32.179
Do something about that smell.

18:33.713 --> 18:36.349
Whuh-uh. You go out front
and rinse off with the hose.

18:36.383 --> 18:39.619
Your Maw Maw eats
in that bathtub.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.657
Hey, buddy.
(gasps)

18:44.691 --> 18:47.327
Please don't kill me.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.562
Whoa, man.
Why would I kill you?

18:49.596 --> 18:51.464
Because I'm stalking your wife
and lured her to my apartment

18:51.498 --> 18:53.433
so she could find me naked
on a bed of rose petals.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.269
You know, when somebody asks,
"Why would I kill you?"

18:56.303 --> 18:58.305
you shouldn't give him
such a good reason.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.939
But I'm not gonna kill you.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.308
Come on, have a beer.

19:06.579 --> 19:07.914
I'm sorry.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.749
It was just so exciting

19:09.782 --> 19:11.651
when your wife
complimented me.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.653
I'll never have
anyone like her.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.756
I'm not all muscular
and outdoorsy like you.

19:16.789 --> 19:20.260
A lot of women like
pale, indoorsy guys.

19:20.293 --> 19:23.496
All I got
are these muscles.
You got a good job.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.398
I'm a barista.
And I'm a Chance.

19:25.432 --> 19:27.534
Both good families.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.768
Plus, you're a waiter,
which means

19:28.801 --> 19:30.303
you're good at math,
so you're smart.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.504
And I don't think
you can do your job

19:31.538 --> 19:32.505
without being
a good listener.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.207
Women love
good listeners.

19:34.241 --> 19:35.475
Hey, that's true.
A lot of waiters

19:35.508 --> 19:37.577
say, uh, no substitutions,

19:37.610 --> 19:39.446
but I actually
encourage them.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.681
Plus, you pursued a
married woman who has
no interest in you.

19:41.714 --> 19:42.682
That means...

19:42.715 --> 19:44.551
I'm nuts?
No.

19:44.584 --> 19:45.918
You're a guy who
never gives up.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.520
Yeah.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.322
(phone rings)
Yeah.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.590
Hello?

19:50.623 --> 19:51.758
Hi, Mom.

19:51.791 --> 19:54.961
Uh, no,
it didn't work out.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.397
But I might have met
my new best friend.

19:57.430 --> 19:58.965
No?

19:58.998 --> 20:00.533
Never mind.
I'll call you back.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.536
Good luck with
everything, buddy.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.572
Thanks.
Hey, remember that Web site

20:05.605 --> 20:08.207
I was telling you about:
painfreetweezers.com.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.644
Hey.

20:11.678 --> 20:15.282
I don't think he'll
be stalking you anymore.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.750
You got a lot more going
for you than muscles.

20:17.784 --> 20:21.388
What you said to that guy
was really smart.

20:21.421 --> 20:24.957
I was in there for
45 minutes-- I couldn't
make a dent in that sap.

20:26.593 --> 20:30.330
It's not just flirting.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.632
It's the ability to
make people feel

20:32.665 --> 20:34.867
really good
about themselves.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.770
Maybe you're right.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.307
Maybe I am more than
just great on the outside.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.710
I'm great up here.

20:43.743 --> 20:44.711
(chuckles softly)

20:46.446 --> 20:48.715
(laughs)
What am I thinking?

20:48.748 --> 20:49.882
I'm gonna need a mirror.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.621
JIMMY:
Dad did have great insight.

20:54.654 --> 20:57.990
Well, about most things.

20:58.024 --> 21:00.560
He knew I was bummed
because things didn't work out

21:00.593 --> 21:04.063
with my flirting
at the grocery store.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.366
But he also knew
what it would take

21:06.399 --> 21:09.636
to make me feel
a lot better about myself.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.938
I'm passing
the torch, son.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.973
Remember,

21:14.006 --> 21:15.642
all you're selling
is the dream.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.624
Hilarious!
