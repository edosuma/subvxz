01:27.560 --> 01:32.407
<i>* I'm the King of my own land,</i>

01:37.400 --> 01:40.688
<i>* Facing tempests of dust,</i>

01:40.840 --> 01:45.562
<i>* I'll fight until the end.</i>

01:49.480 --> 01:55.328
* <i>Creatures of my dreams,
rise up and dance with me.</i>

02:03.880 --> 02:11.880
<i>* Now and forever,
* I'm your King.</i>

02:46.320 --> 02:49.927
Live for France, or die for the King.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.125
Your choice.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.766
How much are they paying you,
gentlemen?

02:56.200 --> 02:58.328
I assure you, it is not enough.

03:26.080 --> 03:29.084
I'm happy to return
home, but you're troubled?

03:31.240 --> 03:35.165
When I was young,
ten years old, I learned what fear was.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.882
I saw my mother scared to death.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.843
The nobles were coming.
She thought she was about to die.

03:43.040 --> 03:46.965
Ever since, I've had a plan
to keep it from happening again.

03:47.120 --> 03:48.360
You are protected.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.842
You have a guard, a palace,
an army that marches for you.

03:52.280 --> 03:53.611
They do not fear me.

03:54.640 --> 03:57.007
What power does any man have over you?

03:57.880 --> 04:00.565
Are we there yet?
I am bored.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.801
Decidedly so.

04:04.600 --> 04:05.600
Ugh.

04:05.680 --> 04:09.480
- Don't expect any wine.
- I'm looking for conversation.

04:09.880 --> 04:13.521
It's hard to make small talk
after killing so many Spaniards.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.401
- Why are we stopped?
- The rains, perhaps.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.562
Rains destroyed the road at Chaville.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.370
We're close.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.081
Stay here.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.004
A shipment from Paris,

04:48.160 --> 04:50.811
stripped of its valuables,
the company killed.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.206
You know that man?

04:54.520 --> 04:56.921
I do not, Sire, it pains me to say.

04:57.640 --> 04:58.880
He's breathing.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.611
- What is this?
- This one's alive!

05:12.320 --> 05:15.608
Deliver him to a doctor.
If he speaks, it will be to me.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.329
- Congratulations.
- For what?

05:32.320 --> 05:34.891
The treaty, our war has ended.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.201
Has it?

05:53.920 --> 05:56.287
So beautiful, so pure.

05:56.760 --> 05:59.604
Do you loiter often
in ladies' dressing rooms?

05:59.760 --> 06:00.760
Whenever I can.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.086
I live for it.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.891
There's nothing like
a lady at her toilette.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.122
- Is that so?
- No, I'm lying.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.126
I can think of five
more appealing things:

06:12.280 --> 06:14.851
warm fire, new stockings,

06:15.000 --> 06:18.482
down pillow,
a gentle breeze on a summer day...

06:19.680 --> 06:23.287
Cabbages, they're fun.
That reminds me, I love your hair.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.843
You are a kind and gentle soul.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.288
I am.
I only hope he's worth the trouble.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.640
Leave.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.844
He? Who would that be, he?

06:35.000 --> 06:38.368
Your husband, of course.
What other man could inspire you so?

06:38.520 --> 06:40.966
- The mind boggles.
- Doesn't it?

06:41.120 --> 06:43.691
Yours rattles,
like a dead mouse in a box.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.282
- I do enjoy your tongue.
- So do I.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.683
I'm a great admirer of its edge,
honed and keen,

06:50.200 --> 06:54.046
- a lacerating organ, if ever I saw one.
- No doubt you've seen a few.

06:54.200 --> 06:57.124
Do you know,
you remind me of a swan on a river?

06:57.280 --> 06:59.282
So graceful on top, but underneath

06:59.440 --> 07:02.762
two fat flippers, just thrashing away.

07:03.080 --> 07:06.448
- And a beak that can break your arm.
- Please don't.

07:07.120 --> 07:10.920
It's been a long campaign.
I hope you were patient.

07:11.400 --> 07:15.041
I adore waiting.
Just think of what it does for wine.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.530
Personally,
I think it all comes down to the grapes.

07:46.840 --> 07:49.446
We have won the peace.
We must use it.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.729
We will unite the country
in celebration here.

07:52.880 --> 07:56.202
We will host a grand entertainment
for the world to see.

07:56.360 --> 07:59.887
Every noble family will be represented.
Our victory is theirs.

08:00.040 --> 08:02.691
- Has Cassel replied to our invitation?
- No.

08:02.840 --> 08:03.841
Send another.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.129
Have Louvois tell my armies
there is work here,

08:07.280 --> 08:09.203
for any man who wants it

08:09.360 --> 08:11.124
The King grows impatient.

08:11.280 --> 08:14.170
The nobles, the building, the road.

08:14.320 --> 08:17.210
Your failure is beginning
to reflect on us all.

08:17.360 --> 08:18.725
He will have justice.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.446
The builders, I think.

09:12.960 --> 09:13.960
Welcome home.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.211
I brought you a gift.

09:27.720 --> 09:28.960
It's a book.

09:29.800 --> 09:33.202
- Is it now?
- I rescued it from a burning monastery.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.602
Sacred anthems
written by chaste men.

09:36.760 --> 09:39.366
Naturally, I thought of you.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.761
You know me so well.

09:42.360 --> 09:45.045
Someone scribbled in it, on every page.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.206
Give it back.
You shall have no present.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Here.

09:50.760 --> 09:51.966
Have a psalm.

10:03.560 --> 10:05.881
I have waited months for this.

10:13.120 --> 10:17.011
- Lies. You wait for no one!
- What has gotten into you?

10:17.160 --> 10:19.367
That's the interesting thing about war.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.522
You learn so much about yourself.

10:21.680 --> 10:24.445
Know what I discovered,
sweet Chevalier?

10:24.600 --> 10:26.204
When the enemy attacked,

10:26.360 --> 10:30.251
when the fighting was close and urgent,
the blood flowing bright,

10:32.120 --> 10:36.489
in the glorious moments nearest
my death, my heart thundered,

10:37.240 --> 10:40.642
and my breeches grew tight,

10:41.240 --> 10:45.006
because the sword inside
them was hard and full,

10:45.160 --> 10:48.528
like a baby's arm clenching his fist.

10:50.840 --> 10:52.126
Can you imagine?

10:54.640 --> 10:58.167
Being in the middle of a battle
with your prick about to burst?

10:59.040 --> 11:00.963
I never knew a Scotsman,

11:01.120 --> 11:04.408
but now I know
what a sporran's really for.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.690
Let me be!

11:12.120 --> 11:13.326
No!

11:33.800 --> 11:35.290
Have you tasted champagne?

11:39.920 --> 11:41.285
You may be about to.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.770
Honestly,
I don't know what you see in him.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.249
You're home but have not arrived.

12:39.800 --> 12:43.646
The body travels on wheels,
the soul travels on foot.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.326
You're not a faithful man, I know.

12:46.480 --> 12:49.370
You can deny it,
but I see it in your eyes.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.811
I never saw you in love
before Versailles.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.848
I never saw it shine in you.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.843
Now you want to share it,

13:04.400 --> 13:06.368
even with those who wish you ill.

13:09.760 --> 13:10.760
If they come.

13:11.160 --> 13:14.767
You reach for the stick
instead of offering the carrot.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.247
What is it that men truly want?

13:19.360 --> 13:21.249
It's simple if you are a woman.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.090
How was war?

13:47.840 --> 13:50.047
Full of mud, and death.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.370
What men do to each other.

13:52.520 --> 13:54.488
What we do to each other.

13:54.640 --> 13:55.640
We're so harsh?

13:56.480 --> 13:59.006
If war was run by women, what then?

13:59.240 --> 14:02.050
- There would be no cannons.
- And far fewer balls.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.440
Please.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.446
Not in front of the baby.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.526
A man can love more than one woman.

14:09.680 --> 14:13.002
They make space so they can
hold more hate in their heart.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.610
- She looks so sad.
- I wonder why.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.802
- It's not for us to judge.
- What else is there to do?

14:36.600 --> 14:41.162
- Do you recall the favor I asked?
- Of course.

14:42.600 --> 14:46.321
The King asked for time alone
in the chapel this afternoon.

14:46.960 --> 14:50.328
Perhaps today is a good day
to thank God for our victory.

14:50.800 --> 14:51.801
Hmm, lucky me.

14:53.640 --> 14:56.689
To have a friend like you,
the luck is all mine.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.603
- Cassel will come.
- And if he does not, Sire?

15:07.200 --> 15:08.200
Yes?

15:08.520 --> 15:13.162
If he does not, then neither will
De Havilland, De Menthon, De Gagnac,

15:13.320 --> 15:17.325
nor any of the northern nobles
who are Cassels' clients.

15:17.480 --> 15:19.881
You will be all alone, Sire.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.648
How kind of you to remind me.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.450
Watch your tongue.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.565
Unless you're twice
the idiot I think you are.

15:27.720 --> 15:29.688
I thought we won the war.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.320
We would have.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.125
If you had only let us.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.051
Official business, brother,
let the men work.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.685
Everyone knows
the reason the war is over.

15:42.560 --> 15:43.686
We're in it.

15:45.600 --> 15:49.650
Sire, your brother has returned
to court without remembering,

15:49.800 --> 15:51.211
perhaps, where he is.

15:51.360 --> 15:54.250
Unlike Louvois,
my brother knows just where he is.

15:54.400 --> 15:57.085
- Of that I'm sure.
- Three cheers then.

15:57.240 --> 16:01.529
Let us dance on the broken backs
of your bravest men.

16:02.480 --> 16:03.481
Cease.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.727
Sorry, what was that?

16:09.080 --> 16:11.845
Oh! You mean "Halt".

16:13.640 --> 16:14.640
A real order.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.848
Sire, your brother is not himself.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.048
If not himself, then who?

16:21.240 --> 16:24.642
I am the sound of distant thunder.

16:24.800 --> 16:25.801
Leave us.

16:32.080 --> 16:35.084
Your first act on returning
is to mortify me.

16:35.720 --> 16:36.960
You took my victory.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.251
So I take from you your pride,

16:40.560 --> 16:42.324
- Your victory?
- Your glory,

16:42.480 --> 16:45.563
- Your victory?
- And everything you hold dear.

16:46.320 --> 16:49.688
- You are not well.
- I wish you could see yourself.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.730
Death to advice, blinded by sin.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.201
Aware only of your own dreams.

16:57.240 --> 17:00.369
No matter how great,
you will have your palace.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.483
What did I say, in the wood?

17:02.840 --> 17:05.525
Good men died in the lie that you spun.

17:05.680 --> 17:06.886
I trusted you.

17:07.040 --> 17:10.806
You knew the outcome before
the first canon fired. A game!

17:10.960 --> 17:12.769
You said you had my back!

17:23.720 --> 17:25.006
Where am I now?

17:57.480 --> 18:00.404
Now the King invites me to a party.

18:03.080 --> 18:05.447
Those barrels are so familiar.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.802
Oh yes, of course, they're mine.

18:09.480 --> 18:12.211
Thieves, my lord, on the road.

18:12.360 --> 18:13.566
Is that so?

18:14.720 --> 18:15.846
Terrible business.

18:17.280 --> 18:21.524
You attack a cargo in the shadow
of the King's convoy and kill my driver?

18:21.800 --> 18:23.609
We had bad information.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.963
Has whoring got to your brain?

18:26.680 --> 18:29.411
Six thousand soldiers home from the war,

18:29.560 --> 18:33.121
new uniforms on the road,
a force to police it, all of it.

18:33.280 --> 18:37.001
Why didn't you attack earlier?
You had everything you needed.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.890
And, I appear to be missing a man.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.685
Tomas is dead.

18:43.320 --> 18:46.449
A fine servant.
The King may trace him back to me.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.762
No witnesses were left alive.

18:48.920 --> 18:52.402
You better be right.
You're the only one who hangs for this.

18:53.640 --> 18:56.405
Cheer up, Montcourt.
You can have Tomas' share.

18:57.160 --> 19:00.050
Just try and stay alive
long enough to spend it.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.611
The King commands you to save this man.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.650
His heart is still beating.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.768
I'm not medically minded,

19:22.920 --> 19:26.083
but I would consider that a good omen.

19:26.840 --> 19:30.003
- It would take a miracle to save him.
- So be it.

19:30.240 --> 19:33.449
The blue bottle on the table,
the kettle, the saw.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.447
Hand me your belt.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.886
I meant cure him, not cook him.

19:49.560 --> 19:52.484
He loses his life or his leg.
Your choice.

19:57.720 --> 19:58.721
Very well then.

20:03.320 --> 20:04.321
Hold him.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
I'm sorry.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.847
- I come here when I need to think.
- I do the same.

20:39.560 --> 20:43.849
I must confess, Sire,
my thoughts today concern you.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.121
And mine.

20:47.400 --> 20:50.290
I believe you know the Duc De Cassel.

20:56.320 --> 20:59.688
Yes, I am quite well acquainted
with that person.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.246
You've known him a long time, I'm told.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.523
As a girl, I knew him very well.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.325
I don't care to remember.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.204
I want you to go to him.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.921
He refuses to attend our celebration.

21:17.080 --> 21:20.527
Since he knows you so well,
he may listen to you.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.966
I need you to persuade him
he's wrong.

21:26.760 --> 21:29.047
You knew I would be here,
did you not?

21:30.480 --> 21:31.925
So you know my answer.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.283
Take whoever you need.

21:37.400 --> 21:40.529
- There is someone.
- And you shall have them.

21:41.600 --> 21:45.605
And when you return,
you shall also have your reward.

21:58.200 --> 22:02.171
Hurry up.
You mustn't keep Henriette waiting.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.846
- You go ahead, mother.
- Very well.

22:25.280 --> 22:27.044
- Give that back!
- Shut up.

22:28.640 --> 22:32.087
- You will not see him.
- You can't tell me who to speak to.

22:32.240 --> 22:36.370
You haven't the slightest clue
what you're dealing with or doing to me.

22:36.720 --> 22:39.803
- I'm late.
- Promise you will never see him.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.921
Or you'll destroy everything.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.650
Do you understand me?

22:44.800 --> 22:47.929
- What is wrong?
- The King wants proof. You must know.

22:48.080 --> 22:50.287
He's demanding we all show our proof.

22:50.440 --> 22:53.046
But it's coming from Pau, Mother.
You said it.

22:57.480 --> 22:59.005
It isn't coming, is it?

23:00.480 --> 23:03.882
- We're not who we claim to be.
- I don't understand.

23:04.440 --> 23:06.602
You were born a Huguenot, like me.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.524
Mother please, stop.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.048
I found a way to make us noble.

23:11.200 --> 23:15.046
If you act against me, you'll destroy
everything I've worked for.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.330
- If the King finds out?
- We hang with the rest!

23:20.560 --> 23:21.641
Oh dear.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.649
Are you scared?

23:24.800 --> 23:26.723
Is your mother scaring you?

23:29.320 --> 23:31.926
Let it out. I'm sorry. Let it out.

23:32.920 --> 23:33.920
Good girl.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.042
Oh!

23:36.200 --> 23:37.486
Never do that again.

23:40.240 --> 23:41.810
I don't believe you.

23:42.160 --> 23:46.165
You better. Your life depends
on doing what I tell you.

24:01.120 --> 24:02.201
There you are.

24:03.520 --> 24:04.806
Madame De Montespan.

24:04.960 --> 24:06.962
I need you for an errand.

24:07.120 --> 24:09.282
My lady will not permit it.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.044
At the King's request.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.402
What sort of errand?

24:14.800 --> 24:16.643
To help me deliver a message,

24:16.800 --> 24:19.644
to an old acquaintance,
the Duc De Cassel.

24:19.800 --> 24:23.327
Of course, the King expects you
to serve his request

24:23.480 --> 24:25.562
with full devotion.

24:40.280 --> 24:41.281
Benoît.

24:43.280 --> 24:45.487
I'll tell you what I've learned.

24:46.880 --> 24:49.565
A woman will bring you trouble,

24:50.680 --> 24:52.967
even when she isn't trying to.

25:08.120 --> 25:11.169
- A diverting volume?
- I'm afraid not.

25:13.840 --> 25:17.765
I've stolen your lady.
Madame De Montespan needed a young girl.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.081
I see.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.805
Of course. Anything for Athénaïs.

25:35.720 --> 25:36.720
And the book?

25:37.440 --> 25:40.967
My husband brought it back
from the front for the Chevalier.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.326
A hand-me-down.

25:43.600 --> 25:44.840
I'm used to it.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.929
Where did my brother find this?

25:58.120 --> 26:01.647
- How is Sophie settling in?
- She's showing promise.

26:01.800 --> 26:05.486
Why was she seen leaving
in a coach with Madame De Montespan?

26:06.040 --> 26:07.040
I had no idea.

26:07.800 --> 26:12.010
When she returns, I want a full report
on how Henriette spends her time,

26:12.160 --> 26:14.561
who she meets,
what she writes. All of it.

26:14.720 --> 26:16.643
That's why you placed her there.

26:17.720 --> 26:19.768
You surprise me, cousin.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.491
I thought you were two steps ahead.

26:22.640 --> 26:24.290
I would make sure of it.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.609
And get your papers in order!

26:32.120 --> 26:35.010
Your lack of compliance
reflects poorly on me.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.968
Our papers are to come by road.

26:38.520 --> 26:41.490
I would pray hard
for their swift arrival.

26:52.240 --> 26:56.165
This is a Cistercian codex
from the low countries.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.922
Very rare, almost forgotten.

26:59.080 --> 27:02.562
Used, it appears,
as an alternative to Roman numerals.

27:03.800 --> 27:07.043
- They're numbers?
- Which correspond to letters.

27:07.600 --> 27:11.366
The book hails from Cambrai
in the Spanish Netherlands,

27:11.840 --> 27:14.810
suggesting that the plot
to kill you started there.

27:15.920 --> 27:20.050
The Dutch were nervous of our war
and meant to stop it by any means.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.641
William of Orange would have me killed?

27:22.840 --> 27:24.763
I believe so, Sire.

27:24.920 --> 27:27.446
They were sent
to find a friendly face,

27:27.840 --> 27:30.411
which means they have
supporters among us,

27:31.160 --> 27:32.810
and they will try again.

28:13.800 --> 28:16.883
I wasn't expecting you tonight.
Oh, my king!

28:20.160 --> 28:22.640
I recognize your caress anywhere.

28:25.680 --> 28:29.241
- It runs in the family, my dear.
- Christ have mercy!

28:31.400 --> 28:34.688
He has great taste.

28:35.160 --> 28:37.811
Get out! Get out! I will tell the king.

28:37.960 --> 28:40.850
Tell him what? My dear heart.

28:42.600 --> 28:45.126
I am his brother and always will be.

28:45.280 --> 28:47.851
You are merely passing through.

28:48.600 --> 28:50.841
I'd enjoy it while you can,

28:51.520 --> 28:54.922
because it's warm when the sun shines,

28:55.080 --> 28:58.770
but believe me, when
he's done with you,

28:58.920 --> 29:02.129
all the lights go out.

29:03.280 --> 29:05.726
You are bathed in sin!

29:13.800 --> 29:15.006
Forgive me.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.849
I will do the talking,

29:43.000 --> 29:47.289
and if he does succeed
in cornering you, pretend to enjoy it.

29:47.440 --> 29:51.081
He loses interest
if there's no one to fight.

29:51.640 --> 29:53.404
- Yes, my lady.
- Good girl.

30:02.080 --> 30:04.811
You do not speak much, I like that.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.249
I'm here to serve you, Lady.

30:09.120 --> 30:10.929
And my king, of course.

30:11.080 --> 30:12.411
I'm in your debt.

30:13.560 --> 30:14.846
How is your husband?

30:16.160 --> 30:19.004
Oh dear, you were doing so well.

30:21.800 --> 30:23.040
Do you miss him?

30:23.760 --> 30:26.525
As a child,
I had dysentery, typhus and rickets.

30:26.680 --> 30:28.489
I miss them all more than him.

30:29.880 --> 30:32.201
Marry for power and rut for love.

30:32.360 --> 30:35.330
If you retain anything from this,
let it be that.

30:37.480 --> 30:40.450
My little fig, what an
unexpected pleasure.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.762
My Lord. Delightful to see you.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.446
Little Athénaïs, all grown up.

30:45.840 --> 30:49.128
So much beauty in one afternoon.
How lucky I am.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.886
I am here, Sir, on the king's business.

30:52.040 --> 30:54.327
You haven't responded
to his invite.

30:54.480 --> 30:57.563
Did I not reply?
How remiss. I've been indisposed.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.370
I'm so sorry.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.842
My apologies to His Majesty.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.447
I trust he will understand
that I cannot come to his party.

31:06.600 --> 31:10.082
As joyful <i>as</i> I am
at our glorious ceasefire.

31:11.520 --> 31:14.000
The gathering is a celebration,

31:14.160 --> 31:16.447
but it is also a memorial,

31:16.600 --> 31:19.524
an homage to those
who died for this peace.

31:19.680 --> 31:21.011
Thank His Majesty.

31:21.160 --> 31:24.607
But I would prefer to pay
my homages alone.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.402
I appreciate you coming so far
to act as the king's postman.

31:28.560 --> 31:32.007
I would be honored
if you and your lady dined with me.

31:32.160 --> 31:34.288
Be advised, my mind is made up.

31:34.600 --> 31:37.604
I hope I might be able
to persuade you otherwise.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.767
You have done well for yourself.

31:43.400 --> 31:44.640
I knew you would.

31:45.880 --> 31:48.611
I flatter myself
that you have come so far.

31:48.760 --> 31:52.128
Admit it. I taught you well, didn't I?

31:52.600 --> 31:56.844
Doesn't Christ teach that we reach
heaven only by going through hell?

31:58.000 --> 32:01.607
So I suppose yes,
I do have you to thank for that.

32:03.040 --> 32:04.769
Sweet Athénaïs,

32:06.560 --> 32:08.369
always fighting back.

32:16.920 --> 32:21.050
The first message is simple.
"Kill the men who bring the map."

32:23.080 --> 32:25.731
The second one is more intriguing.

32:26.240 --> 32:28.083
A riddle, in fact.

32:33.320 --> 32:34.924
The end is near.

32:36.480 --> 32:37.925
Make your peace with God.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.770
The King cannot imagine
his celebration without you,

32:54.160 --> 32:55.889
as I'm sure you're aware.

32:56.040 --> 32:58.611
His Majesty flatters me.

32:58.760 --> 33:03.402
He is aware of your love
of your lands, so he has an alternative.

33:04.400 --> 33:08.200
If you can't come to the party,
the party will come to you.

33:09.280 --> 33:10.611
What do you mean?

33:10.760 --> 33:14.765
You will host the party.
The King will move the court here.

33:15.480 --> 33:17.562
He will send an army of builders

33:17.720 --> 33:19.722
to rebuild the chateau,

33:20.240 --> 33:24.040
to be ready to receive
his thousands of guests.

33:24.320 --> 33:26.084
The King jokes at my expense.

33:26.240 --> 33:28.891
No, the party will be at your expense.

33:29.680 --> 33:32.604
- That wouldn't be a problem.
- Come now.

33:33.520 --> 33:35.488
I've seen your house before:

33:36.040 --> 33:38.771
frayed cushions and moldy walls.

33:39.720 --> 33:41.404
A bit like you, Cassel,

33:42.320 --> 33:44.971
a decent exterior, but underneath,

33:45.680 --> 33:47.250
rotten to the core.

33:50.680 --> 33:53.126
I am wealthy beyond your reckoning.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.809
You used to be.

33:56.560 --> 33:58.801
You brag of your proxies in Paris,

33:58.960 --> 34:01.042
but they're not working anymore.

34:01.200 --> 34:04.090
I bet your staff haven't
been paid in a while.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.606
It would be inconvenient
for his Majesty.

34:08.159 --> 34:11.243
Not as inconvenient
as your absence at Versailles.

34:16.760 --> 34:18.170
She's beautiful, no?

34:19.199 --> 34:22.647
So pure. She will, of course, be there.

34:22.800 --> 34:24.290
I promise.

34:27.600 --> 34:28.681
How old are you?

34:31.600 --> 34:32.806
Sixteen.

34:33.560 --> 34:34.686
Sixteen.

34:39.480 --> 34:40.561
Come here.

35:02.720 --> 35:05.041
I love when they play hard to get.

35:05.640 --> 35:08.291
Isn't that right, my little fig?

35:15.720 --> 35:16.801
Impressive.

35:17.960 --> 35:20.361
Help me, please.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.568
I shall call him Lazarus.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.440
And you,

35:25.880 --> 35:28.770
I do not yet know
what I shall call you.

35:29.520 --> 35:30.726
Who is this man?

35:31.360 --> 35:32.771
What did he do?

35:33.200 --> 35:34.281
He's done nothing,

35:36.360 --> 35:37.771
said nothing.

35:38.200 --> 35:40.521
Please, do not undo the work.

35:40.920 --> 35:42.160
Quiet, please.

35:48.640 --> 35:52.845
Charlotte Parthenay
died in my arms.

35:56.160 --> 35:57.889
Your musket, was it?

35:59.320 --> 36:01.482
I wouldn't try to run.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.171
Might give you a shock.

36:03.320 --> 36:05.527
<i>I</i> didn't kill her.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.245
But you were there.

36:11.520 --> 36:12.520
Who did?

36:13.200 --> 36:14.247
Who did?

36:14.680 --> 36:16.728
I did not see.

36:17.280 --> 36:18.611
You did not see?

36:20.120 --> 36:22.726
You were not looking.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.803
I guess you won't need this.

36:29.960 --> 36:31.200
Oh my god!

36:34.360 --> 36:37.569
- For your collection.
- Please let him live.

36:38.120 --> 36:41.567
I just need him to answer
a simple question.

36:42.320 --> 36:44.846
- Whom do you serve?
- De Cassel.

37:10.160 --> 37:13.642
He drank nine bumpers
of the Turin Rosa Solis after supper.

37:15.400 --> 37:19.007
And three more after arriving here.
Then he fell asleep.

37:24.240 --> 37:26.766
He's like a child when he sleeps.

37:28.440 --> 37:29.680
We all are.

37:38.920 --> 37:39.920
Oh, it's you.

37:41.640 --> 37:43.369
My brother,

37:44.400 --> 37:45.765
the magician.

37:46.280 --> 37:47.486
Magician?

37:49.600 --> 37:52.922
Her brother in England
with allies against you,

37:53.360 --> 37:57.604
the prospect of a winter campaign,
grain supplies running low.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.765
Only you could sign
a ceasefire and call it victory.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.441
- We'll talk tomorrow.
- Now, brother.

38:06.160 --> 38:09.562
I do not think I will be awake tomorrow.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.162
You haven't replied to the invite.

38:13.320 --> 38:14.526
Hmm.

38:14.880 --> 38:17.565
- I assume you are coming.
- Yes, sir!

38:17.960 --> 38:21.089
I do as commanded by my superiors.

38:22.680 --> 38:26.571
Drink your fill tonight.
You will not do this at the party.

38:27.200 --> 38:28.770
I will entertain myself.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.726
As you say, brother,

38:31.160 --> 38:34.289
the greatest glory
is to die for King and country.

38:34.440 --> 38:36.807
I have to disagree. From experience,

38:36.960 --> 38:39.406
the greater glory lies in living.

39:09.400 --> 39:10.970
What can war do to a man?

39:12.120 --> 39:14.202
You are no stranger to that, Sire.

39:16.240 --> 39:18.811
But when he returns home, for example?

39:20.000 --> 39:22.890
No man leaves a battlefield unchanged.

39:24.080 --> 39:25.491
Many see ghosts,

39:26.720 --> 39:29.690
even the sight of a fountain
can spark memories.

39:30.640 --> 39:33.723
Some go mad, some take to drink,

39:35.120 --> 39:36.804
some take their own lives.

39:37.960 --> 39:42.329
Others grow orange trees
for their kings.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.285
You returned as another?

39:46.040 --> 39:49.442
I felt aggrieved
only when I wasn't paid.

39:50.480 --> 39:53.962
- What happened then?
- I did whatever was necessary.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.722
What did your family think?

39:59.320 --> 40:01.482
I lost my family to war.

40:01.640 --> 40:02.846
How?

40:03.320 --> 40:05.288
Three sons, all dead.

40:06.440 --> 40:07.680
In your service.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.241
MY prayers.

40:12.200 --> 40:13.611
There's no need.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.648
God has no place for us.

40:17.200 --> 40:18.725
He does if you confess.

40:20.440 --> 40:24.843
I need no confession, Sire,
for I know I committed no sin.

40:26.120 --> 40:27.485
If you say so.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.283
May your gathering be glorious.

40:31.440 --> 40:34.205
I will make sure of it. I always do.

41:08.520 --> 41:09.885
Enchanting evening, isn't it?

41:10.040 --> 41:12.042
Yes, Sire, delightful.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.482
Cassel, you surprise me.

41:38.640 --> 41:40.369
How could I stay away?

41:41.920 --> 41:43.410
Sophie's done well.

41:44.280 --> 41:46.886
Perhaps Montespan's
the best place for her.

41:47.560 --> 41:50.245
I must return her.
She's not mine to give away.

41:50.400 --> 41:52.607
She's on loan. Go. Be free.

41:54.920 --> 41:56.206
You cunt.

41:56.640 --> 41:59.166
I know you meant that as an insult,

41:59.320 --> 42:01.243
but I am a proud cunt.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.801
You, if I remember right, are a prick,

42:03.960 --> 42:05.883
a tiny, shriveled prick.

42:06.680 --> 42:09.809
- You'll pay for this.
- I already have. Believe me.

42:21.440 --> 42:22.851
It is done, Sire.

42:52.200 --> 42:53.850
Bow to your King.

43:25.440 --> 43:27.169
You ignored my invitation.

43:28.120 --> 43:29.360
I could not come.

43:30.120 --> 43:32.043
My duty called me elsewhere.

43:32.640 --> 43:35.086
I want to believe you.

43:35.840 --> 43:36.887
Please try.

43:39.400 --> 43:41.528
- Follow me.
- No.

43:43.360 --> 43:46.409
You want to. I can tell.

43:47.600 --> 43:50.080
It can never be between us.

43:51.240 --> 43:52.287
I know.

43:53.280 --> 43:57.330
- <i>So...</i>
- So? Come with me.

44:06.600 --> 44:09.171
We are told not to play with fire,

44:10.400 --> 44:11.526
but they enjoy it.

44:13.800 --> 44:16.326
I see no merit in it, no skill.

44:16.480 --> 44:17.925
Oh I don't know.

44:18.080 --> 44:21.243
A little burning is good for the soul,
don't you think?

44:21.800 --> 44:24.770
Joan of Arc might disagree with you,
or Lucifer.

44:24.920 --> 44:28.720
I fancy that in another life,
we might have been friends.

44:28.880 --> 44:31.804
I don't have time
to give myself to fancy.

44:32.480 --> 44:35.324
- That's a surprise.
- Nor do I care for those.

44:37.240 --> 44:38.924
How unfortunate for you.

44:49.280 --> 44:52.602
- So soon?
- I've seen burning paper before.

44:56.960 --> 44:59.566
I'm leaving. Bring my horse.

45:04.200 --> 45:05.440
He's finally gone.

45:08.120 --> 45:09.360
Drink with me.

45:17.040 --> 45:18.690
You look splendid.

45:22.360 --> 45:24.442
I'm grateful you're here, brother.

45:24.920 --> 45:26.888
I believe you for once, brother.

45:35.400 --> 45:38.006
I was promised
a walk in the garden.

45:39.720 --> 45:41.529
We're in a garden now.

45:42.600 --> 45:43.886
So we are.

46:22.240 --> 46:23.321
Brother?

46:53.440 --> 46:54.726
Brother.

47:51.960 --> 47:56.329
On the field, I saw a man,
young like we were.

47:58.280 --> 48:01.841
He carried his brother
in a sack over his shoulder.

48:05.320 --> 48:09.211
He told me he had promised
their mother to take him home.

48:11.200 --> 48:13.089
Would you do that for me?

48:15.440 --> 48:17.169
I would, but you?

48:21.640 --> 48:22.880
I do not know.

48:23.680 --> 48:26.923
You think because I'm King,
I'm not also a brother?

48:27.480 --> 48:29.801
That I have everything
and want nothing?

48:31.560 --> 48:33.767
A King does not live the life he wants.

48:34.680 --> 48:36.842
You live those moments for me.

48:37.240 --> 48:40.403
You live the life a King yearns for.

48:43.160 --> 48:46.243
- The war still rages in you.
- It will never cease.

48:46.400 --> 48:47.526
You mean halt.

48:49.760 --> 48:52.525
You cannot resist the last word,
can you?

48:54.720 --> 48:57.929
- Brother...
- Don't. Leave me. I command you.

49:23.760 --> 49:26.411
When I was 12,
Cassel took away my childhood.

49:27.040 --> 49:28.451
What was left of it.

49:30.040 --> 49:31.644
I'm grateful to you, Madame.

49:32.760 --> 49:34.683
You understand more than anyone.

49:35.760 --> 49:37.171
Understand what, Sire?

49:37.840 --> 49:39.569
That in order to rule

49:39.720 --> 49:42.644
the first thing you must learn
is sacrifice.

50:44.640 --> 50:46.802
The King requires your papers.

50:48.320 --> 50:52.086
Your noble papers, Sire, your lineage.

50:54.720 --> 50:57.769
- They're ashes.
- Then you are without proof.

50:59.680 --> 51:03.651
Only true nobles are exempt from tax.
Arrears to be repaid in full.

51:05.080 --> 51:07.606
I have nothing. It's all gone.

51:08.240 --> 51:09.651
You're in his debt.

51:10.360 --> 51:12.044
Arrest this man.

51:13.305 --> 51:19.184
