PERFECT HAPPINESS

39:21.446 --> 39:22.838
MIGHT LIE WITH HER.

39:22.882 --> 39:24.884
NIGHT.
YEAH.

39:25.798 --> 39:29.149
Narrator:
AS THE PIE MAKER PONDERED
THE HAND THAT HE JUST HELD,

39:29.192 --> 39:33.719
HE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THE MANY
DIFFERENT FORMS LOVE COULD TAKE,

39:33.762 --> 39:36.809
EACH ONE PRECIOUS
IN ITS OWN WAY.

39:38.811 --> 39:41.422
AW. THANKS.

39:41.466 --> 39:45.774
Narrator: THOUGH SOME
WERE MORE UNIQUE THAN OTHERS.

39:48.124 --> 39:50.779
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE FOR ME.

39:50.823 --> 39:54.479
I KNOW
YOU FEEL THAT NOW, BUT...

39:54.522 --> 39:58.352
THERE ARE THINGS YOU WANT.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.354
THERE ARE THINGS
WE BOTH WANT.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.225
SO?
EVERYONE WANTS STUFF.

40:02.269 --> 40:04.227
WE WAKE UP EVERY DAY
WITH A LIST OF WISHES
A MILE LONG,

40:04.271 --> 40:07.143
AND MAYBE WE SPEND
OUR LIVES TRYING TO MAKE
THOSE WISHES COME TRUE.

40:07.187 --> 40:09.450
BUT...JUST BECAUSE
WE WANTTHEM

40:09.494 --> 40:11.844
DOESN'T MEAN WE NEEDTHEM
TO BE HAPPY.

40:13.367 --> 40:18.894
WHAT DO YOU NEED
TO BE HAPPY?

40:22.202 --> 40:22.768
YOU.
