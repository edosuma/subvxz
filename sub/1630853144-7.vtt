WEBVTT

00:00.968 --> 00:02.336
So we had an idea.

00:02.336 --> 00:04.972
It's a new feature for the app
called "CounterPro."

00:06.039 --> 00:08.709
I have been secretly feeding
Bulk Beauty intel

00:08.709 --> 00:10.477
on all of the brands
that they're going after.

00:10.477 --> 00:13.647
But because I had to sign
a non-compete agreement,

00:13.647 --> 00:15.949
I'm stuck here for two years.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.384
What am I gonna do?

00:17.384 --> 00:19.553
Non-compete agreements
aren't enforceable
in California.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.455
-Wait, what?
-Yes!

00:21.455 --> 00:23.056
Tanya and I split up.

00:23.056 --> 00:25.158
And I'd like to ask you
to be my primary.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.761
Angelica and I used to date.

00:27.761 --> 00:28.996
Do you know
if she's seeing anyone?

00:28.996 --> 00:30.264
I don't really know.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.999
I mean,
she hasn't mentioned anyone.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.767
I've made a decision
about your proposal.

00:34.101 --> 00:35.369
I'm pushing it forward.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.970
Now the real work begins.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.139
You can kiss
your personal life goodbye!

00:39.139 --> 00:41.508
You've read
Malika's proposal, right?

00:41.508 --> 00:42.809
It's not a top priority.

00:42.809 --> 00:44.478
My sister left home
eight years ago

00:44.478 --> 00:46.246
and I've no idea
where she's at.

00:46.246 --> 00:48.248
I think she might've lived here
at some point.

00:48.248 --> 00:49.349
How long have you been
homeless?

00:49.349 --> 00:50.350
Since I was 14.

00:50.350 --> 00:51.552
Can't get a regular job.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.020
And that's the thing
about being invisible.

00:53.020 --> 00:54.821
No one cares
when they erase you.

00:54.821 --> 00:56.623
Who are you
and how are you
doing my dance?

00:56.623 --> 00:58.592
Oh! Uh-uh, I am sorry.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.360
-- Alice, you're back!
-- Early!

01:00.360 --> 01:01.895
Margaret had
to cancel her tour

01:01.895 --> 01:02.963
'cause she booked a movie.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.364
I know you quit the tour.

01:04.364 --> 01:05.699
Why did you lie?

01:10.037 --> 01:12.573
I actually moved to LA
to be a waiter.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.775
Yeah, but it's a tough industry
to break into,

01:14.775 --> 01:18.078
so I'm doing stand-up comedy
on the side to pay the bills.

01:18.645 --> 01:20.514
I really think I'm about
to get my big break.

01:21.148 --> 01:23.550
I just met
at the Rancho Cucamonga
Olive Garden.

01:23.550 --> 01:27.287
Word on the street,
they're talking two-figure deal.

01:27.988 --> 01:29.523
Breadsticks for days.

02:32.219 --> 02:34.287
So how's the
women's center proposal
going?

02:36.123 --> 02:37.290
It's going great.

02:41.094 --> 02:45.332
I think you have done
excellent work.

02:46.566 --> 02:48.101
It's ready
to take to the floor.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.070
Oh, wow!

02:51.338 --> 02:53.206
-That is so exciting!
-It is.

02:53.206 --> 02:56.376
You just need
two council members
to sponsor it.

02:56.376 --> 02:58.679
So I suggest you approach
my closest allies,

02:58.679 --> 03:00.714
Councilmen Gonzales
and Brown.

03:00.714 --> 03:03.150
Gonzales and Brown,
got it.

03:03.550 --> 03:05.986
Even though Lucia has me
working day and night,

03:05.986 --> 03:06.987
it's been...

03:08.455 --> 03:09.523
worth it.

03:09.990 --> 03:13.026
I mean, I never could've
moved this fast

03:13.026 --> 03:14.494
in the nonprofit space.

03:14.494 --> 03:16.596
Mm. Mm-hmm.

03:16.596 --> 03:19.499
Maybe I was wrong
about you taking this job
in politics.

03:19.499 --> 03:21.168
Oh, yeah, you were
definitely wrong,

03:21.168 --> 03:22.569
but that's okay.

03:25.072 --> 03:25.906
So...

03:27.908 --> 03:30.577
have you thought about us
being each other's primaries?

03:33.714 --> 03:35.415
-I have.
-Yeah?

03:36.616 --> 03:37.751
And?

03:46.660 --> 03:47.794
Hey, thank you

03:47.794 --> 03:49.930
for your advice
about calling Callie.

03:51.498 --> 03:54.067
You were right.
It was exactly what I needed.

03:54.601 --> 03:56.336
All good.
I'm glad to hear that.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.040
It must be... hard for you

04:00.707 --> 04:02.442
not hearing from your sister
in so long.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.479
Yeah, it is.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.915
Can I ask
why she left home?

04:10.250 --> 04:13.954
Um, I don't really love
talking about that.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.890
-Oh, sorry. Sure.
-No, no, it's fine.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.024
Morning.

04:28.535 --> 04:31.671
Hey, Joaquin, I just read
your article on Luca.

04:31.671 --> 04:33.473
I didn't know he was unhoused.

04:33.473 --> 04:34.441
How do you know Luca?

04:34.441 --> 04:36.009
Uh, we met when he
crashed in your loft.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.012
Crashed?
Who crashed? When?

04:40.280 --> 04:41.915
Uh, it was just
a friend of mine,

04:41.915 --> 04:43.717
for like two nights
when I was out of town.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.486
Okay, well, notice
of any overnight guests

04:46.486 --> 04:47.921
must be submitted
to the manager,

04:47.921 --> 04:49.222
who is me.

04:49.222 --> 04:50.423
Without special permission,

04:50.423 --> 04:51.992
there's
a two-consecutive nights
rule.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.528
As if rules are ever
enforced around here.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.131
Listen up!

04:58.131 --> 04:59.299
That's gonna change
around here.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.968
No more Ms. Nice... Gal.

05:02.569 --> 05:05.939
I'm bringing back
the chore chart
and community service.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.407
And late fees on late rent!

05:07.407 --> 05:10.777
And no more showering
for more than 10--
10 minutes.

05:11.778 --> 05:12.679
You've got to be kidding me.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.447
And we have ants!

05:14.447 --> 05:16.683
Ugh! What's wrong
with you people?

05:17.150 --> 05:20.787
Okay. Uh, do you have any way
to get a hold of Luca?

05:20.787 --> 05:23.557
I think I might have
a job opportunity for him
if he's interested.

05:23.557 --> 05:26.827
Oh, um, you know,
I tried calling him
the other day,

05:26.827 --> 05:28.328
but his phone
was disconnected, so.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.430
Well, do you know
where I could find him?

05:31.264 --> 05:34.100
The last place I saw him
was an encampment
by Skid Row.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.336
-Okay. Thanks.
-Yeah.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.405
Hold on.
You're not going
down there alone.

05:38.405 --> 05:39.773
No, I'll be fine.

05:39.773 --> 05:40.707
No, I'm gonna go
down there with you.

05:40.707 --> 05:42.342
Just give me a minute
to change.

05:43.143 --> 05:43.977
Okay.

05:45.478 --> 05:48.315
And people keep leaving food
and dirty dishes around,

05:48.315 --> 05:50.417
which probably creates crumbs.

05:50.417 --> 05:51.685
Tasty little crumbs!

05:51.685 --> 05:52.986
No more eating in your lofts!

05:53.587 --> 05:55.555
-Damn it!
-What's up with her?

06:05.198 --> 06:06.032
What?

06:07.801 --> 06:09.169
I know you quit the tour.

06:11.404 --> 06:12.772
What's going on, Alice?

06:13.773 --> 06:15.075
Why did you lie?

06:17.177 --> 06:19.679
Because I don't want
to do stand-up anymore.

06:19.679 --> 06:21.348
And I didn't want
a bunch of questions.

06:21.348 --> 06:24.017
What?
But you love stand-up!

06:24.718 --> 06:26.620
Well, you know,
after being on tour

06:26.620 --> 06:28.755
and learning
what it's really like,
I changed my mind.

06:29.422 --> 06:31.558
-What--
-It's not what I want
to do anymore!

06:37.330 --> 06:38.265
I'll tell you later.

06:38.732 --> 06:42.002
If you see one ant,
there are thousands of ants

06:42.002 --> 06:44.437
in a colony
somewhere close by

06:45.805 --> 06:47.007
with a queen.

06:49.476 --> 06:52.379
Yo! Dennis, hey!
You got a minute?

06:52.379 --> 06:54.080
-Sure.
-Uh...

06:54.981 --> 06:56.149
What do you know
about this girl?

06:58.485 --> 06:59.953
Jenna?
She used to live here.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.890
She went by, like,
another name, right?

07:03.890 --> 07:05.058
Diana Graham?

07:05.058 --> 07:06.927
Uh, yeah.
I think she told me

07:06.927 --> 07:08.895
that she had to use
someone else's name on her lease

07:08.895 --> 07:11.264
'cause she had
a bad credit score or something.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.399
-You know her?
-Uh, yeah.

07:12.399 --> 07:13.967
We're just both from Oklahoma.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.535
I'm trying to track her down.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.137
I haven't seen her in a while,
but then again,

07:17.137 --> 07:18.405
I don't hang out
in clubs anymore.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.307
Oh, is that where you...
met her?

07:20.307 --> 07:21.875
Yeah. She used to come
to some of my shows.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.109
She actually
brought me back here.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.312
It's how I found out
about The Coterie,

07:25.312 --> 07:26.479
as a matter of fact.

07:26.479 --> 07:28.715
Hmm. She brought you
back here?

07:28.715 --> 07:30.050
-Yeah.
-Nice.

07:31.584 --> 07:33.520
You have her number
or anything?

07:33.520 --> 07:34.955
Uh, no.
Never got her number.

07:34.955 --> 07:38.558
But I do remember
that I bumped into her
a few months later

07:38.558 --> 07:39.960
at a bar called Mickey's.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.330
She was, uh, dating
the manager, I think,
named Chris.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.665
Don't remember his last name.
Not sure if he's still there.

07:45.665 --> 07:48.301
-You should check it out.
-Okay, cool. Yeah, thanks, man.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.369
-Good luck with that.
-Yeah.

07:54.441 --> 07:57.143
So, we have
a surprise for you.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.982
We finished the deck
for CounterPro!

08:01.982 --> 08:03.616
And we think it's ready
to pitch to Jackie.

08:07.187 --> 08:10.623
So... I have good news.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.326
Callie told me
that non-compete contracts

08:13.326 --> 08:15.562
aren't actionable
in the state of California,

08:15.562 --> 08:18.398
which means
I can leave Revitalize

08:18.398 --> 08:20.066
and officially come back
to Bulk Beauty.

08:20.066 --> 08:22.435
-Yes!
-This is such great news!

08:22.435 --> 08:25.005
-Group hug!
-Group hug!

08:25.005 --> 08:27.574
Oh, yay!
Now we're back!

08:27.574 --> 08:29.142
It's amazing.
It's great news!

08:29.142 --> 08:32.746
However, um...
there is one more problem.

08:35.782 --> 08:39.452
Ava and Raisa have
a big idea for the app,

08:39.452 --> 08:42.188
and I think
it might totally crush us.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.157
What is it?

08:45.625 --> 08:49.062
I can't say.
That would be stealing!

08:49.062 --> 08:51.865
And-- And we don't steal.
We're better than Jackie.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.668
But... I do have an idea.

08:56.302 --> 08:59.873
If my non-compete isn't binding,
neither is Ava and Raisa's.

09:00.373 --> 09:05.011
So what if we invite them
to join Bulk Beauty

09:05.011 --> 09:06.713
and they bring
their big idea to us

09:06.713 --> 09:08.148
before they pitch it
to Jackie?

09:09.349 --> 09:11.551
Would they leave Revitalize
to come here?

09:12.385 --> 09:13.453
I feel very confident.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.622
And if I explain everything,

09:15.622 --> 09:18.258
they won't want
any part of an app idea
that was stolen.

09:21.694 --> 09:22.962
So, you're a spy?

09:22.962 --> 09:25.131
Is this why Bulk Beauty
has been signing our brands?

09:26.099 --> 09:27.867
Because you've been
sabotaging us?

09:28.568 --> 09:32.338
No, no. I-- I--
I mean, maybe a little.

09:32.338 --> 09:35.008
But only because
Jackie stole our idea

09:35.008 --> 09:36.776
after we pitched it to her.

09:36.776 --> 09:38.311
And she manipulated you two

09:38.311 --> 09:40.213
into creating her own version
of Bulk Beauty.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.849
That's not true.
We came to Jackie.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.784
Yeah, we didn't rip off
anyone's idea.

09:44.784 --> 09:46.886
No, you didn't.

09:47.620 --> 09:50.156
But you did say

09:50.156 --> 09:52.225
that your original pitch
was about cleaning products,

09:52.225 --> 09:53.893
and that she steered you
into beauty.

09:54.828 --> 09:55.995
Don't you find it odd

09:55.995 --> 09:57.897
that the code
was already written?

09:58.832 --> 10:00.467
That was our code.

10:00.467 --> 10:03.736
She cloned it
and then changed it just enough
so we couldn't sue.

10:04.737 --> 10:06.473
So why are you
telling us this now? Hmm?

10:07.207 --> 10:10.310
Because I am asking you...

10:11.211 --> 10:14.280
to leave Revitalize
and come to Bulk Beauty,

10:14.280 --> 10:17.417
where we actually value
women in tech,

10:17.417 --> 10:19.486
and don't pit them
against each other.

10:20.887 --> 10:24.257
And you don't wanna
be a part of an idea
that's stolen, right?

10:25.758 --> 10:29.195
I don't know, Mariana.
You still lied to us.

10:29.195 --> 10:30.697
Agreed.

10:30.697 --> 10:32.866
This is a lot to digest.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.237
-We need to think about this.
-We need to think about this.

10:44.944 --> 10:47.247
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.
Have you seen this person?

10:47.247 --> 10:48.081
His name is Luca.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.250
No?

10:59.993 --> 11:00.994
So sorry to bother you

11:00.994 --> 11:03.229
but have
you seen this man, Luca?

11:04.264 --> 11:05.498
Long, brown hair?

11:06.533 --> 11:08.201
About 5'9".

11:08.201 --> 11:10.203
Mm-hmm. Sorry.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.342
Sadly, I think we might be

11:16.342 --> 11:18.378
looking for a needle
in a haystack.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.979
If you have stuff to do,
you can go on.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.414
Davia,
I'm here to help.

11:22.248 --> 11:23.183
Thank you.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.251
But if we don't find him
by the afternoon,

11:25.251 --> 11:26.319
the job will be filled.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.054
What is this job?

11:31.524 --> 11:33.693
Five, six, seven, eight.

11:35.094 --> 11:36.262
Feel it!

11:37.964 --> 11:38.998
And eight.

11:39.799 --> 11:43.036
Three, four, five,
shoulder, shoulder, shoulder.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.005
One, two, three,
four, five,

11:46.005 --> 11:48.608
leg, seven, eight,
and one.

11:48.608 --> 11:49.642
Nice!

11:50.243 --> 11:51.311
Ah!

11:53.012 --> 11:55.048
Great work.
Great work today!

11:56.649 --> 11:58.851
You are all
really coming together
as an ensemble.

11:58.851 --> 12:00.220
woman:
Yeah.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.590
Oh, unfortunately,
Jessie had to fall out.

12:03.590 --> 12:06.359
So I'm holding auditions
for a new dancer tomorrow,

12:06.926 --> 12:08.494
if anyone knows anyone
who's interested.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.836
Does it have to be a woman?

12:17.737 --> 12:20.006
I mean, could it be a man?

12:21.007 --> 12:22.342
Burlesque?

12:22.342 --> 12:24.777
That's amazing.
When did you get into that?

12:25.111 --> 12:27.981
Well, after I got fired
for that video,

12:27.981 --> 12:29.215
I just wanted
to do something

12:29.215 --> 12:31.784
that made me proud
of my body and myself.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.921
You know,
build my confidence back.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.156
We're gonna get invited
to this show?

12:37.156 --> 12:38.725
Yeah, we'll see
if I'm that confident.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.094
I don't know.
Luca's a dancer.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.630
I just didn't want him
to miss the opportunity

12:43.630 --> 12:45.331
if it was something
he'd be interested in.

12:48.901 --> 12:49.869
What?

12:50.603 --> 12:52.205
You're a good--
You're a good person.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.206
Oh, stop it.

13:12.258 --> 13:14.360
Well, apparently, I'm not
that good of a person.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.862
-Yeah, me either.

13:18.931 --> 13:20.066
We should
keep looking.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.869
Yeah, that's great.

13:22.869 --> 13:25.271
Councilman Gonzales.
Councilman Gonzales.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.274
Oh, hi, I was wondering
if you had a chance

13:28.274 --> 13:29.575
to read
my women's center proposal?

13:30.376 --> 13:31.778
So I just figured that--

13:31.778 --> 13:33.813
Councilman Brown isn't able
to sponsor your project.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.616
Uh, I'm sorry.
I can't support another motion
at this time.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.284
I'm sorry.

13:57.970 --> 13:58.938
You okay?

14:02.742 --> 14:05.445
Lucia told me to ask
Councilmen Gonzales and Brown

14:05.445 --> 14:07.814
to co-sponsor my proposal,
and they both said no.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.482
But I don't get it.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.017
They're supposed
to be Lucia's allies.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.187
Yeah.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.690
Look, I probably
shouldn't tell you this,

14:17.690 --> 14:20.193
but I have a friend
who's an aide
in Gonzales' office,

14:20.193 --> 14:22.729
and she told me
that Lucia asked him not to.

14:23.329 --> 14:25.164
Wait. What?

14:26.699 --> 14:27.934
Why would she do that?

14:27.934 --> 14:29.535
For some reason
she's not telling you,

14:29.535 --> 14:30.837
she obviously wants
to kill it.

14:31.437 --> 14:33.606
But... that's...

14:34.273 --> 14:36.409
so not okay!

14:36.409 --> 14:38.177
But that's so politics.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.098
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Chris.

14:59.098 --> 15:00.500
Does he still work here?

15:00.500 --> 15:02.602
Yeah, unfortunately.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.773
I'm Chris.
What can I do for you?

15:08.508 --> 15:10.877
Uh, just looking
for an old friend of mine,
Jenna Perez.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.548
What'd you say
your name was?

15:16.349 --> 15:18.618
I didn't.
Jake Davis.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.453
Like I said,
just an old friend of Jenna's.

15:20.453 --> 15:21.554
Just moved back to LA,

15:21.554 --> 15:23.256
so I'm just trying
to reconnect with her.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.590
Who told you
to come to me?

15:24.590 --> 15:26.192
Uh, a friend of hers.

15:26.192 --> 15:29.028
Said that you guys were,
like, an item or something.

15:29.028 --> 15:29.996
I wouldn't say that.

15:29.996 --> 15:32.665
I mean,
she used to hang out
at the bar.

15:34.333 --> 15:35.568
But I barely knew her.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.236
Any chance you know
where she is?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.339
I haven't seen her
in a long while.

15:40.807 --> 15:43.910
Gotcha. You don't have,
like, a number or an email or--

15:43.910 --> 15:45.845
I don't. Sorry.

15:46.512 --> 15:48.881
Wish I did,
but like I said,

15:48.881 --> 15:50.316
it's been a while.

15:50.316 --> 15:52.185
Hmm.
Help me out--

15:52.185 --> 15:53.886
I've gotta get
these bottles stocked, so...

15:55.321 --> 15:56.289
Sure.

15:57.657 --> 15:58.758
Thanks anyway, man.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.681
Hey, man,
you worked here long?

16:22.281 --> 16:23.149
Couple years.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.518
Yeah? How well
you know, uh, Chris?

16:25.518 --> 16:26.986
Well enough to know
he's an asshole.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.055
Here I was thinking
I was special.

16:29.789 --> 16:30.890
Let me ask you something.

16:30.890 --> 16:32.558
You know, uh...
You know this girl?

16:33.292 --> 16:35.361
Yeah, that's Chris' ex,
Jenna.

16:35.361 --> 16:37.163
Oh, ex.
So they were serious?

16:37.163 --> 16:38.731
They were living together.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.132
Pretty hot and heavy
for a while.

16:40.132 --> 16:41.434
I don't know what happened,
he didn't say.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.602
Just that they broke up.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.237
-Gotcha. Thanks, man.
-Yeah.

16:51.277 --> 16:52.712
What if he doesn't
want to do it?

16:52.712 --> 16:54.614
Well, he still needs
to know about it.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.315
Even if he doesn't
want to dance,

16:56.315 --> 16:58.551
we should still help him out,
he's a nice guy.

17:00.086 --> 17:01.220
Hey-- Davia!

17:06.826 --> 17:08.694
Luca! Hey!

17:08.694 --> 17:10.763
It's me, Davia.
Do you remember me?

17:10.763 --> 17:12.331
Oh, uh, yeah.
No, of course, I do.

17:12.331 --> 17:13.332
Dennis, this is Luca.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.835
-Hey.
-What happened to you?

17:16.369 --> 17:19.338
Oh, um, no, it's just,
um, this guy on the streets,

17:19.338 --> 17:20.773
like, been harassing me.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.375
You know, just, like,
trying to shake me down.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.510
That is terrible.
I'm so sorry.

17:24.510 --> 17:26.812
Yeah, it is what it is.

17:26.812 --> 17:29.382
I'm actually...
I'm on my way out of town.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.883
No! You can't leave.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.186
I mean, I have an opportunity
for you to dance.

17:34.186 --> 17:35.187
You have to stay.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.115
Can someone please
explain to me

18:03.115 --> 18:05.985
why our competitor
is landing more brands
than we are?

18:06.719 --> 18:09.255
We just won
the Archambeau Cosmetics pitch.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.156
Thanks to Mariana.

18:10.556 --> 18:12.458
I have my boss
coming down on me

18:12.458 --> 18:14.126
because I gave
a chance to you two.

18:14.126 --> 18:16.562
I gave you the code.
I gave you the idea.

18:16.562 --> 18:20.333
I handed it all over to you.
And what have you done for me?

18:20.600 --> 18:23.436
Do you have any ideas
of your own
you'd like to show me?

18:28.240 --> 18:29.241
Good news!

18:29.241 --> 18:31.143
Since Gonzales
and Brown declined

18:31.143 --> 18:33.045
to sponsor
the women's center proposal,

18:33.045 --> 18:34.880
I got two other
council members on board.

18:35.781 --> 18:36.649
What?

18:37.450 --> 18:38.517
Hernandez and Russo.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.357
I... I didn't ask you

18:44.357 --> 18:46.993
to approach
Hernandez and Russo.

18:46.993 --> 18:50.096
Those council members
are going to expect favors
from us in return.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.132
Oh.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.502
I'm so sorry.

18:56.502 --> 18:58.104
I know how invested you are

18:58.104 --> 19:00.039
in helping women
impacted by incarceration,

19:00.039 --> 19:01.574
and I didn't think
it would be a problem

19:01.574 --> 19:03.743
since the goal
was to get the proposal
to the floor.

19:04.610 --> 19:05.544
Right?

19:05.544 --> 19:08.848
You don't decide
what the goals are here.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.686
And neither do I.
She does.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.091
I mean, you don't wanna
kill it, do you?

19:21.494 --> 19:22.528
Of course not.

19:25.031 --> 19:29.135
Just next time,
ask before you take action.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.839
Absolutely, um, I will.

19:43.115 --> 19:45.084
That was not
a sincere apology.

19:45.084 --> 19:46.886
That was acting.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.154
And I would know because--

19:48.154 --> 19:50.990
I know, Will.
"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"
two episodes.

19:53.092 --> 19:54.193
You saw them!

20:10.309 --> 20:11.343
Are you serious?

20:11.343 --> 20:12.945
Who sent you?

20:18.884 --> 20:19.785
Gah!

20:33.933 --> 20:35.167
You're not gonna
see this coming.

20:36.168 --> 20:38.437
I'm gonna find you,
you tiny bitch!

20:39.572 --> 20:40.639
Yes, I will.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.076
What're you doing?

20:45.745 --> 20:48.781
I'm gonna flush out
the queen ant with lemon water.

20:49.381 --> 20:51.383
And when she sends
a signal to the colony

20:51.383 --> 20:52.952
that it's time to move,

20:52.952 --> 20:56.756
I'm gonna catch her, kill her,
and take her army down!

21:00.626 --> 21:05.664
Okay. Um, Sumi
told me that you...

21:06.632 --> 21:07.666
left the tour

21:08.100 --> 21:10.269
and that you don't wanna
do comedy anymore.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.404
What's up with that?

21:17.810 --> 21:18.711
Are you good?

21:21.347 --> 21:24.116
I'm fine. I'm fine!
I'm fine, I'm fine.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.152
Everything's fine. Yeah.

21:26.152 --> 21:28.220
God, why would
Sumi tell you that?

21:28.220 --> 21:31.023
Because I asked.
And I'm worried about you.

21:31.023 --> 21:33.159
Did you have
a bad night on stage?

21:35.294 --> 21:36.162
No.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.464
People's dreams change.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.167
And I don't wanna be
interrogated about it.

21:42.401 --> 21:43.235
Okay.

21:51.377 --> 21:55.147
But, you know, sometimes
we can hit a speed bump,

21:55.147 --> 21:57.516
or a wall even,

21:57.516 --> 21:59.151
but it doesn't mean
we have to quit.

22:01.253 --> 22:02.721
Remember when we saved
that bird?

22:04.256 --> 22:08.260
You know, sometimes
the closed windows of life
can knock us down,

22:08.260 --> 22:10.563
but we can always
get back up again

22:10.563 --> 22:11.864
and give things
another chance,

22:12.698 --> 22:15.000
whether that's a new thing

22:16.168 --> 22:17.236
or the old thing.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.943
In the meantime,
I bought ant traps.

22:26.145 --> 22:27.012
Maybe they'll help?

22:28.447 --> 22:30.649
At least until
you flush out the queen.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.563
So...

22:45.831 --> 22:46.966
What happened?

22:48.601 --> 22:49.602
Are they in?

22:49.602 --> 22:51.237
Oh, God,
it's bad news, isn't it?

22:52.905 --> 22:56.008
Do you have any ideas
of your own
you want to show me?

22:59.845 --> 23:01.046
I have a question.

23:02.581 --> 23:03.816
Who did write the code?

23:05.384 --> 23:07.386
What does that have to do
with anything?

23:07.853 --> 23:11.223
Your concern
is what you're bringing
to the table.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.792
I need
some fresh, new ideas.

23:14.627 --> 23:15.961
We'll get right on it.

23:15.961 --> 23:17.496
Yeah, we'll brainstorm

23:17.496 --> 23:19.932
some fresh, original ideas
for you.

23:20.266 --> 23:21.267
See that you do.

23:21.901 --> 23:22.835
Impress me.

23:23.736 --> 23:24.603
All of you.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.246
Raisa and Ava...

23:36.815 --> 23:37.716
are coming to Bulk Beauty.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.386
-Yes!
-No way!

23:40.386 --> 23:42.154
We just have
to go back to clean out
the rest of our stuff,

23:42.154 --> 23:43.889
and then tomorrow
will be our last day.

23:45.291 --> 23:46.659
This is fantastic!

25:54.420 --> 25:55.354
Jenna?

26:08.133 --> 26:09.168
What are you doing here?

26:09.168 --> 26:10.269
Can I come in
and talk to you
for a second?

26:10.269 --> 26:11.437
-No!
-Why? Is Jenna in there?

26:11.437 --> 26:12.905
-I just want to talk to her.
-No. No one's here.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.274
-Okay. Jenna! Jenna!
-Hey!

26:15.274 --> 26:16.508
-She's not here!
-Jenna, please!

26:16.508 --> 26:19.011
-Jenna--
-She's not here.

26:19.611 --> 26:21.380
Who the hell you think you are,
barging into my house?

26:21.380 --> 26:23.916
I'm her brother!
Okay, I'm her brother.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.717
And I know you lived together.
So why'd you lie?

26:28.420 --> 26:29.655
I didn't know
who the hell you were.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.458
Look, Jenna and I dated
for a few months,

26:32.458 --> 26:34.760
and she crashed here
for a while, but it was a mess.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.929
All we did was fight,
so we broke up.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.865
She asked me to drive her
to Palm Springs one night

26:39.865 --> 26:41.400
so she can stay with a friend.

26:42.734 --> 26:44.703
But on the way,
we got into it again.

26:44.703 --> 26:47.473
She told me to stop the car
or she'd jump out!

26:47.473 --> 26:50.375
So I stopped.
She got out, and that was it.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.444
-I haven't seen her since!
-You left her
in the middle of nowhere?

26:52.444 --> 26:53.512
I had no choice!

26:54.513 --> 26:56.115
Look, I don't care
if you're her brother or not.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.083
She's crazy.
I was tired of it.

26:58.083 --> 27:00.319
-You piece of shit!
-Call the cops.

27:00.319 --> 27:01.320
-You piece of shit!
-Call the cops!

27:04.756 --> 27:06.058
You better pray
nothing happened to her.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.383
No one really
comes down here.

27:31.383 --> 27:34.186
It's mostly used
for stage sets and props.

27:35.220 --> 27:37.556
There's a bathroom
right around the corner.

27:38.190 --> 27:39.658
Cool. Thank you.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.027
And, um,
you're sure you guys

27:42.027 --> 27:44.696
aren't gonna get
in any trouble for this?

27:44.696 --> 27:47.666
It's just temporary until
we figure something else out.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.569
You're not safe on the street.
You will be here.

27:50.569 --> 27:53.272
If you need food
or anything else, we got you.

27:58.477 --> 27:59.545
Why are you guys
doing this?

28:00.879 --> 28:03.115
Um, I guess

28:03.115 --> 28:05.217
we know what
it feels like to be alone.

28:06.051 --> 28:08.320
And that's one
of the reasons
we all live here,

28:08.320 --> 28:09.521
is to be there
for each other.

28:10.556 --> 28:11.490
Create a community.

28:13.659 --> 28:14.927
Um, just--

28:15.827 --> 28:17.029
Thank you.

28:17.596 --> 28:18.430
Seriously.

28:18.931 --> 28:22.201
No one's ever done anything
this kind for me.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.304
Of course.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.646
We gotta get you
a new cell phone
tomorrow, though.

28:34.646 --> 28:35.914
So... sleep well.

28:36.648 --> 28:37.482
I will.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.985
-Good night.
-Good night.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.795
All right, you guys,
thank you so much for your time.

28:49.795 --> 28:50.796
That is it. Thank you.

28:50.796 --> 28:53.332
And, uh,
I will see you guys later.

28:56.435 --> 28:58.403
emcee:
Aaron Therol, everybody.

29:00.539 --> 29:01.707
Let's keep it going, guys.

29:01.707 --> 29:05.978
Our next comedian
was recently on tour
with Margaret Cho.

29:05.978 --> 29:10.415
Please welcome to the stage,
Alice Kwan!

29:22.527 --> 29:24.763
So... what should I do?

29:30.836 --> 29:33.272
Don't say anything.
Don't tell anyone.

29:35.307 --> 29:38.910
Your mother is right.
Keep quiet.

29:38.910 --> 29:40.112
You understand?

29:41.847 --> 29:42.881
Mingbai ma?

29:45.584 --> 29:48.687
-Mingbai ma?
-Mingbai, okay, I won't.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.123
I won't.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.964
Let's hear it
for Alice Kwan!

30:26.191 --> 30:27.726
We'll see you
on the flip side.

30:27.726 --> 30:30.862
Yeah. Thanks for that
fresh, new idea, Marianna.

30:52.084 --> 30:53.018
You okay?

30:54.419 --> 30:56.388
I'm sorry. Um...

30:57.689 --> 31:00.625
Yeah, just, um,
Jackie came down
really hard on me.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.328
I think I'm gonna be fired.

31:05.330 --> 31:07.766
Jackie came down on all of us.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.101
Oh.

31:09.801 --> 31:11.203
Maybe I just suck.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.938
What? No.
Don't-- Don't say that.

31:13.739 --> 31:16.274
I think you're
a really good project manager.

31:17.843 --> 31:21.580
Jackie thinks that you have
to motivate by fear.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.249
That's not how you get
the best out of someone.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.418
Very true.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.490
I don't even know
why I'm crying.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.759
I'm not, like,
a leaky person.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.428
I just, um...

31:37.129 --> 31:38.263
I guess I'm scared.

31:40.198 --> 31:41.400
If I lose this job,

31:45.036 --> 31:46.071
who's gonna hire me?

31:53.245 --> 31:54.246
Look...

31:57.215 --> 31:59.084
I'm going back to Bulk Beauty,

32:00.952 --> 32:04.723
and I'm taking Ava
and Raisa with me.

32:06.425 --> 32:07.592
Why don't you come with us?

32:08.994 --> 32:11.496
Really? You'd want me?

32:12.297 --> 32:16.401
Yeah, we're all
super-talented, competent women.

32:17.302 --> 32:18.703
We deserve
to be our own bosses,

32:18.703 --> 32:22.941
not work under a toxic person
like Jackie.

32:24.776 --> 32:25.610
What do you say?

32:29.514 --> 32:30.449
Okay.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.084
Yeah. Let's do it.

32:33.952 --> 32:34.820
I'm in.

32:35.754 --> 32:36.721
Perfect!

32:37.222 --> 32:40.459
Okay, well, um,
I will text you
all the details.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.761
And in the meantime,
pack all your stuff.

32:42.761 --> 32:43.595
Will do.

32:44.596 --> 32:45.497
Mariana?

32:46.865 --> 32:47.799
Thank you,

32:49.000 --> 32:50.268
for believing in me.

32:50.836 --> 32:51.736
Of course.

33:25.170 --> 33:28.573
Basically, I asked
for forgiveness
instead of permission.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.042
Was she mad?

33:31.042 --> 33:33.311
Yeah, I think
she was pretty pissed off.

33:34.579 --> 33:38.016
And here I am talking about her
instead of you.

33:38.917 --> 33:41.086
So her diabolical plan
is working!

33:41.086 --> 33:42.287
Oh, no. Mm-hmm.

33:44.923 --> 33:46.258
-Oh, thank you.
-Yes.

33:48.326 --> 33:51.296
I'm sorry.
Let's talk about us.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.232
-Us?
-Mm-hmm.

33:54.232 --> 33:56.701
Let's do something fun
like take a trip.

33:57.736 --> 33:59.170
Hike the Grand Canyon

33:59.170 --> 34:02.274
or go to Kern River
and ride the rapids, hmm?

34:02.274 --> 34:04.809
Look at you,
suddenly Dora the Explorer!

34:04.809 --> 34:06.678
Well, I know
how much you like adventure,

34:06.678 --> 34:08.547
and I like you.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.216
And I wanna spend
more time with you.

34:12.350 --> 34:13.218
Me too.

34:15.887 --> 34:16.922
Well, what about Dyonte?

34:16.922 --> 34:18.790
I mean, now that he's not
with Tanya anymore,

34:18.790 --> 34:20.759
I'm sure he's gonna wanna
spend time with you too.

34:23.295 --> 34:25.130
Actually, um...

34:26.698 --> 34:30.835
Dyonte asked me
to be his primary.

34:33.405 --> 34:34.239
What did you say?

34:48.320 --> 34:52.090
I think it's a little too soon
after your breakup with Tanya.

34:53.625 --> 34:54.659
Don't you?

34:57.462 --> 34:58.997
Obviously not.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.538
Is that the only reason?

35:11.676 --> 35:12.544
No.

35:13.979 --> 35:19.451
I'm starting to have
strong feelings for Angelica.

35:21.653 --> 35:23.154
And I don't think
I'm ready to commit

35:23.154 --> 35:25.390
to taking that next step
with you right now.

35:29.928 --> 35:30.996
I understand.

35:34.232 --> 35:37.502
Not gonna lie,
I am a little jealous
though.

35:39.838 --> 35:44.509
Mr. Cool Poly Guy
getting jealous?

35:45.477 --> 35:48.413
-You getting jealous?
-I am human.

35:52.017 --> 35:54.419
No, no!
Okay, I just did my hair!

36:03.094 --> 36:05.230
So did I have anything
to do with your decision?

36:07.032 --> 36:07.999
You did.

36:10.735 --> 36:11.803
I'm glad to hear that.

36:21.513 --> 36:24.182
So are we getting
in this pool or... not?

36:26.017 --> 36:26.851
Let's do it.

36:28.386 --> 36:29.921
-Let's go.
-All right.

37:35.019 --> 37:35.854
Hey.

37:38.389 --> 37:39.224
Can you talk?

37:40.892 --> 37:41.726
Sure.

37:56.708 --> 37:57.842
My sister left

37:57.842 --> 38:00.612
because we grew up
in a really religious home.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.082
And our dad was--

38:05.116 --> 38:07.452
He was strict... and mean,

38:08.119 --> 38:10.822
and even violent sometimes.

38:13.258 --> 38:16.161
And when she said,
you know, she was leaving,

38:16.161 --> 38:19.164
he told her that
she wasn't his daughter anymore

38:20.665 --> 38:22.734
and that she was no longer
part of the family

38:22.734 --> 38:25.303
and wasn't allowed
in his house.

38:27.038 --> 38:30.141
So, you know, a few years later,
like, I got out of there too.

38:32.911 --> 38:36.314
I recently found out
that she had been here in LA,

38:36.314 --> 38:38.650
so I-- I've been here
looking for her.

38:42.821 --> 38:45.990
My-- My mom thinks
that she's dead.

38:48.193 --> 38:51.663
And you know, I thought,
like, my mom's just--

38:51.663 --> 38:53.298
She's being crazy, right?

38:57.936 --> 38:59.270
But, man, I'm...

39:00.238 --> 39:02.040
I'm-- I'm really worried

39:02.040 --> 39:04.275
that something horrible
happened to her,

39:08.213 --> 39:09.314
and that she's right.

39:15.119 --> 39:16.354
I'm so sorry.

40:36.534 --> 40:39.370
No. No, no, no, no.

40:46.144 --> 40:48.513
I-- I found the source
of the ants.

40:52.450 --> 40:55.586
It was me!
It was my fault!

40:56.454 --> 40:58.189
It was all my fault.

41:03.561 --> 41:05.997
It's not your fault.
It's okay.

41:05.997 --> 41:08.433
I didn't know.

41:08.433 --> 41:10.601
It's okay.
It's okay.

41:10.601 --> 41:14.172
Babe, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.
