WEBVTT

00:01.386 --> 00:02.979
What do you think
is going on around here?

00:03.207 --> 00:05.503
Well, Doc, I'll tell you.
This is the middle of America.

00:05.628 --> 00:07.799
Folks around here
don't get the big city blues.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.579
We worry about
the price of corn,

00:09.724 --> 00:11.007
not terrorist attacks.

00:11.131 --> 00:14.131
Wes! I don't want excuses,
I don't want theories,

00:14.234 --> 00:16.158
I want to know what
happened to that research.

00:16.262 --> 00:18.331
I think we should
sit down and talk to David.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.310
I think that Connor
McGuinn would like that.

00:21.805 --> 00:23.891
That'll get you in
anywhere you want to go.

00:24.061 --> 00:25.946
If you find what you're
looking for, let me know.

00:26.485 --> 00:27.840
I'm not the enemy.

00:28.244 --> 00:29.315
Fuck!

00:30.498 --> 00:31.572
What is that?

00:31.737 --> 00:33.642
Concentrated retrovirus in medium.

00:33.896 --> 00:35.160
Shower now!

00:37.347 --> 00:39.663
- You think the water might be poisoned?
- Could be.

00:39.837 --> 00:41.590
You think that's
what killed the deer?

00:42.135 --> 00:43.623
Ah shit!

00:44.556 --> 00:45.833
Parasitic worms.

00:46.028 --> 00:49.001
- Where are the worms coming from?
- They lay their eggs in the water.

00:49.206 --> 00:51.132
Okay, I'll alert the
Governor of Arkansas.

00:51.215 --> 00:52.971
You better alert the
Governor of Missouri, Iowa,

00:53.057 --> 00:54.310
and Illinois while you're at it.

00:54.465 --> 00:56.592
We don't know how far
this has spread up the Mississippi.

00:57.005 --> 00:59.463
- I have crystal.
- I'm clean these days.

00:59.688 --> 01:02.060
- Do you mind if I do?
- No, go ahead.

01:09.276 --> 01:11.660
Ramona! Come on! Come on!
Get up! Come on!

01:11.796 --> 01:12.822
She's dead.

01:14.218 --> 01:16.323
- I fucked up.
- Yeah, you did, Owen.

01:17.068 --> 01:19.242
You really did.

01:21.765 --> 01:23.123
<i>David?</i>

01:24.226 --> 01:25.372
Dad?

01:25.505 --> 01:27.373
Uh, David, uh...

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.187 --> 01:46.090
I don't have to tell
you everything I do.

01:46.346 --> 01:48.941
This is exactly why I got you
a caregiver in the first place.

01:49.025 --> 01:51.150
She couldn't have done
anything about the fire.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.663
She might have found your
pipe before it lit up the couch.

01:54.107 --> 01:56.853
No, I got it. I got it.
I got it. I got it.

02:02.646 --> 02:05.173
So this is where I'm going
to spend the rest of my life?

02:05.296 --> 02:06.353
Not bad, eh?

02:06.436 --> 02:07.810
A brick box.

02:08.425 --> 02:10.199
If you wanted a suite
at the Sutton Place,

02:10.308 --> 02:12.201
you should've been nicer
to me as a kid.

02:12.807 --> 02:13.840
What?

02:14.118 --> 02:15.263
Nothing.

02:22.405 --> 02:24.162
Come on, Dad.

02:25.766 --> 02:29.362
Well, they certainly spared
no expense on the decor, did they?

02:30.916 --> 02:32.522
Bed's nice and firm.

02:32.795 --> 02:34.322
No bed rails?

02:35.487 --> 02:37.282
Drawers don't stick.

02:37.406 --> 02:39.080
Cheap laminate.

02:40.457 --> 02:41.690
Nice.

02:42.415 --> 02:44.233
Oh yeah,
those are great.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.210
Well, at least
they're flame-retardant!

02:48.297 --> 02:50.293
You just won't leave
it the hell alone, will you?

02:50.427 --> 02:52.631
Dad, you could have
been killed in that fire.

02:52.888 --> 02:54.002
Yes...

02:54.188 --> 02:56.092
And for that one mistake,

02:56.178 --> 02:57.800
I will die here

02:58.366 --> 03:00.341
surrounded by ugliness.

03:00.627 --> 03:01.843
Jesus...

03:03.707 --> 03:05.263
What are you looking at?!

03:05.637 --> 03:06.912
What?

03:07.246 --> 03:09.660
Oh. Good morning...

03:10.777 --> 03:12.391
Excuse us.

03:14.425 --> 03:15.582
We'll upgrade you.

03:15.806 --> 03:19.162
I'm sure that suites become
available here all the time.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.661
Yes, because people die
here all the time.

03:22.308 --> 03:25.672
Whatever survived the fire will
be here in a couple of days, all right?

03:25.807 --> 03:29.382
We'll get some of your pictures
up on the wall, you know? Nice, nice...

03:29.636 --> 03:31.513
Make the place
look just like home.

03:33.806 --> 03:36.743
I have Alzheimer's.

03:41.757 --> 03:43.973
- Did you hear me?
- Yeah, I heard you.

03:47.158 --> 03:50.431
I was diagnosed a few weeks
before your mother died.

04:08.756 --> 04:10.112
So uh...

04:13.795 --> 04:15.410
I'll see you soon.

04:18.745 --> 04:20.293
Welcome to Toronto.

04:31.115 --> 04:32.521
Oh, God...

04:40.516 --> 04:42.742
Do you want to stay with me?

04:47.408 --> 04:48.893
I'd like that.

06:32.326 --> 06:35.420
2.11 - Fishy

06:50.675 --> 06:52.140
Jesus Christ!

06:54.146 --> 06:55.122
What the fuck you doing?

06:55.267 --> 06:57.483
Been eatin' that poison
for close to three years now.

06:57.666 --> 06:59.572
Not a big fan of halibut myself.

06:59.698 --> 07:02.030
You're the head guy on that panel.
Advised the government:

07:02.215 --> 07:05.322
told 'em that genetically modified
fish were safe for human consumption.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.882
- Well, everyone but that one.
- Look, I ain't in no mood for your humor.

07:08.118 --> 07:10.592
- I'll take my act somewhere else, then.
- I sent ya a hundred emails.

07:10.728 --> 07:12.002
- Jesus Christ.
- Earl Jordan.

07:12.395 --> 07:14.400
Earl at total email dot ca.

07:14.728 --> 07:18.060
Oh, great. Look, M. Jordan,
that panel was, like, four years ago.

07:18.235 --> 07:20.030
And  we debated genetically modified...

07:20.167 --> 07:22.631
- I know all about you and your bullshit...
- Well then you know

07:22.768 --> 07:25.820
that we didn't say the fish were safe,
we said there was nothing we could find

07:25.907 --> 07:27.861
to say the fish was unsafe.
You get the difference?

07:28.165 --> 07:29.850
I got something to show
you how wrong you are...

07:30.247 --> 07:31.823
That's my boy, Dr. Sandstrom.

07:32.366 --> 07:34.392
Perfectly healthy
until eight months ago.

07:34.517 --> 07:37.283
One day he's running in the yard,
the next he's all crippled up in pain.

07:37.476 --> 07:39.432
Whole body's paralyzed now.
Can't say a word...

07:39.666 --> 07:41.562
You think that genetically
engineered fish did this?

07:41.837 --> 07:44.811
My wife ate the fish when she was
pregnant. Now look what happened.

07:51.725 --> 07:54.863
I'm sorry about your kid
but there's a hundred...

07:55.055 --> 07:56.632
They took his blood,
they X-rayed his brain,

07:56.768 --> 07:58.060
they poked and prodded him

07:58.197 --> 08:00.902
with every goddamn surgical tool
they got in Newfoundland and nothing...

08:01.095 --> 08:03.132
They even sent us up
to Toronto for tests. Still nothing.

08:03.308 --> 08:06.051
- I know this is a touchy issue...
- Don't you patronize me,

08:06.286 --> 08:08.140
you son of a bitch, or
I'll put you on the windshield.

08:08.935 --> 08:12.132
There's only one reason that the fish
farms are allowed to do their business.

08:12.385 --> 08:13.990
'cause the government
said it was safe.

08:14.148 --> 08:16.272
Because you told the
government it was safe.

08:16.447 --> 08:18.631
- No, I never said--
- Look I know what you said...

08:19.315 --> 08:21.183
All  right. I get it.
You think I'm an asshole.

08:21.285 --> 08:23.182
Anything else I can
do for you today?

08:24.035 --> 08:25.061
Yeah.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.911
I got one more thing for you.

08:49.075 --> 08:50.941
Here's my boy's samples.

08:51.575 --> 08:53.623
Blood, urine...

08:55.038 --> 08:56.992
Look at his charts, his X-rays.

08:57.168 --> 09:00.040
If it ain't the fish that's doing
it to him, tell me what is.

09:06.995 --> 09:09.013
You ain't gonna help me, are ya?

09:11.486 --> 09:13.902
I kinda figured, driving up here.

09:14.916 --> 09:16.882
I promised his mother I would.

09:19.037 --> 09:20.580
She just stares at Kenny.

09:20.797 --> 09:23.212
Hopes he'll be
a healthy little boy again.

09:24.748 --> 09:26.062
Be able to just...

09:26.466 --> 09:29.021
see him smile at her
like the way he used to.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.770
He can't even smile no more.

09:36.616 --> 09:38.320
Seems like none of us can.

09:45.416 --> 09:47.541
Sorry about the windshield, Doc.

10:06.107 --> 10:07.363
Shit!

10:22.427 --> 10:24.393
- Hey.
- Hey, boss!

10:24.585 --> 10:27.023
- When did they let you out?
- About four hours ago.

10:27.538 --> 10:29.952
They decided they needed
the bed for a sick person, eh?

10:30.106 --> 10:32.460
- That's right.
- Get caught up on your reading?

10:32.546 --> 10:35.110
Yeah, and I'm still, like
a thousand hours behind

10:35.215 --> 10:38.043
on my retrovirus work because of
a crappy piece of lab equipment...

10:39.006 --> 10:40.571
That reminds me...

10:44.227 --> 10:45.533
What is this?

10:46.526 --> 10:47.912
Happy Homecoming.

10:50.671 --> 10:51.646
David...

10:52.155 --> 10:53.810
A brand new Vortexer.

10:54.184 --> 10:55.785
Ahh! Look at that.

10:56.158 --> 10:58.262
- It's silver.
- Yeah.

10:58.828 --> 11:00.493
It's very sweet of you, thank you.

11:00.878 --> 11:02.791
Yeah... Oh.

11:04.245 --> 11:05.982
And  there's more...

11:06.758 --> 11:07.942
You remember that Italian study

11:08.048 --> 11:10.441
on reactivation of retroviruses
you were wondering about...

11:10.637 --> 11:12.970
Using the mouse genome?
Yeah, they haven't published, yet.

11:13.076 --> 11:13.903
No...

11:14.797 --> 11:16.333
But they sent me
a pre-print copy.

11:16.526 --> 11:18.660
- You're kidding.
- I was going to bring it to you today.

11:19.686 --> 11:22.943
I only looked at the abstract,
but I think you're going to find it

11:23.176 --> 11:24.700
- pretty interesting.
- Give me that!

11:26.608 --> 11:28.690
Wow. Wow. Wow.

11:29.068 --> 11:31.302
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Oh! You're welcome.

11:31.445 --> 11:33.622
- It's good to be back.
- Good to have you back.

11:35.376 --> 11:37.590
It's good to see your back.

11:47.468 --> 11:48.390
Earl...

11:56.296 --> 11:57.950
Persistant bastard.

12:11.358 --> 12:12.922
Shit.

12:42.635 --> 12:45.353
Once inside the victim,
the worms began to secrete phorbol,

12:45.557 --> 12:48.642
which in turn
activates Protein Kinase C.

12:48.725 --> 12:49.903
What's that?

12:50.025 --> 12:52.672
A protein that's been
linked to depression in humans.

12:52.798 --> 12:54.620
So where do these
worms come from?

12:54.905 --> 12:58.400
We found some isolated cases
in a remote area of Haiti.

12:58.508 --> 13:01.382
We think they got to New Orleans
on the winds of hurricane Katrina.

13:01.557 --> 13:04.861
<i>- So is the condition treatable?
- Well we're showing some positive results</i>

13:04.958 --> 13:07.960
using an anti-parasitic
drug, niclosamide,

13:08.138 --> 13:09.990
used in animals to kill tape worms.

13:11.335 --> 13:12.660
<i>- Excuse me.
- Sure.</i>

13:12.787 --> 13:14.601
- Got a sec?
- I'm on hold with McGuinn.

13:14.966 --> 13:18.020
- I need to buy a new pencil.
- Can't this wait?

13:18.477 --> 13:20.713
Look, something has come up.
It's kind of eatin' at me.

13:20.877 --> 13:22.611
I just need to look into it.
Won't take long.

13:23.308 --> 13:24.592
<i>- You still there?
- Yeah.</i>

13:24.758 --> 13:26.620
- So that's okay?
- We'll talk later.

13:26.786 --> 13:28.231
Absolutely. Thanks.

13:28.605 --> 13:29.801
David!

13:29.938 --> 13:31.081
<i>- Caroline?
- Connor.</i>

13:31.215 --> 13:33.342
When do you think you
could get down to Washington?

13:34.236 --> 13:37.732
- What are we talking about?
- About dinner, a good night's sleep

13:38.027 --> 13:40.710
and then we sit down with the
Appropriations' Committee chairman,

13:40.795 --> 13:42.783
who happens to be from Arkansas

13:42.865 --> 13:44.783
and is anxious to hear
about your work down there.

13:44.915 --> 13:46.953
- I'm on my way.
- Good work, Caroline.

13:47.335 --> 13:48.440
Thanks.

13:52.646 --> 13:54.681
Something has come up.
It's kind of eatin' at me.

13:54.777 --> 13:56.963
I just need to look into it.
Won't take long.

13:57.256 --> 13:58.550
<i>- You still there?
- Yeah.</i>

13:58.768 --> 14:00.560
- So that's okay?
- We'll talk later.

14:00.686 --> 14:02.152
Absolutely! Thank you.

14:03.106 --> 14:04.200
David!

14:18.708 --> 14:20.480
I just need to borrow this.

14:48.347 --> 14:50.060
The thing is... Thank you.

14:50.215 --> 14:52.962
The thing is, some
fisherman from Newfoundland

14:53.086 --> 14:56.061
just tried to kill me
with a 15-pound halibut.

14:56.428 --> 14:59.042
- Fried or baked?
- The guy was both, if you ask me.

14:59.276 --> 15:01.020
Morning. Is that what
we're having for dinner tonight?

15:01.125 --> 15:01.991
You're coming?

15:02.058 --> 15:03.601
Not if that's what we're
having for dinner tonight.

15:03.817 --> 15:05.473
- Lamb shanks.
- Lamb shanks.

15:05.825 --> 15:08.613
I love your lamb shanks. With the herb
and garlic rub and the balsamic glaze?

15:08.788 --> 15:10.563
- Those'd be mine.
- Awesome.

15:10.685 --> 15:12.892
- I'll pick you up.
- Oh okay. So Mayko,

15:13.066 --> 15:16.233
see if you can dig up any recent public
health studies on GMO fish, alright?

15:16.417 --> 15:18.772
Why? You think there's
something fishy with the fish?

15:19.085 --> 15:21.852
Sorry. I guess
we've got other fish to fry.

15:22.045 --> 15:23.091
Stop it!

15:23.615 --> 15:26.030
- David, what's going on?
- I need to use your station.

15:26.166 --> 15:27.671
Okay. Why?

15:28.046 --> 15:28.891
Oh...

15:29.718 --> 15:32.070
What do you know
about halibut, Bob?

15:32.717 --> 15:35.141
They live at or near
the bottom of the water

15:35.368 --> 15:37.992
and they prefer a temperature
of 2 to 5 degrees Celsius.

15:38.188 --> 15:38.862
Okay.

15:39.896 --> 15:42.870
They can travel great distances.
As a matter of fact,

15:43.125 --> 15:46.783
one was tagged and then found
to have swam 2,500 miles.

15:46.995 --> 15:48.091
Ok, Thanks, Bob.

15:48.215 --> 15:49.703
- Or is it swum?
- Bob.

15:52.295 --> 15:55.931
You remember, about four years ago,
that panel I was on, about GMO...

15:56.096 --> 15:57.673
I disagreed
with your decision.

15:57.918 --> 16:00.273
Yes, but not
with the science.

16:00.758 --> 16:03.691
I mean, we found nothing
to say that GMO fish were...

16:03.968 --> 16:06.171
you know, gonna be
the next great plague.

16:07.756 --> 16:09.140
You called me closed-minded

16:09.225 --> 16:10.992
and told me I wasn't
thinking about the future.

16:11.117 --> 16:14.760
And you hurt my feelings because you didn't
understand the point that I was trying to make...

16:15.038 --> 16:17.201
- about the unknown ramifications.
- Yeah, okay, look.

16:17.888 --> 16:21.232
The fish got bigger and faster
and that's all they were supposed to do.

16:23.078 --> 16:25.470
But was it necessary to
genetically modify the fish?

16:25.637 --> 16:27.990
Well, five years ago,
up there in Fox Sound

16:28.158 --> 16:30.003
all the waters there
had been fished out.

16:30.126 --> 16:31.841
There's no work.
So yeah, it was necessary...

16:32.158 --> 16:35.342
- I wouldn't say it was necessary.
- The point I'm trying to make...

16:36.398 --> 16:38.792
is that they have been farming GMO fish

16:38.946 --> 16:41.261
in Fox Sound for the last four years.

16:41.508 --> 16:43.341
Pulling them out of the
water by the ton every day.

16:43.538 --> 16:46.862
And I just want to make sure that
this is the same GMO we approved.

16:47.287 --> 16:49.880
- Why would they be any different?
- Well for one thing,

16:50.045 --> 16:52.863
the fish that we tested were raised
in confined little tanks, right?

16:53.055 --> 16:55.803
Now they're raising them in
these great big undersea cages.

16:56.506 --> 16:59.592
You know what? Could you
just find out if there's anything

17:00.098 --> 17:02.551
weird in this DNA,
would you? Could you?

17:08.218 --> 17:09.490
Do  you think
you made a mistake?

17:09.607 --> 17:11.329
- No.
- So why are you doing this?

17:12.376 --> 17:14.403
Because I just want to be...

17:15.205 --> 17:18.430
- Because I just want to do it, okay?
- Whose blood is this, David?

17:21.665 --> 17:24.122
Okay, a guy came to me

17:24.226 --> 17:27.682
because  he thinks his little boy
is crippled as a result of

17:28.155 --> 17:31.360
of all this mutant fish
they've been eating up there.

17:31.886 --> 17:33.620
And you think the fish...

17:33.846 --> 17:35.692
- altered his DNA?
- I don't know, Bob.

17:35.836 --> 17:38.422
I just want to take a
look at it, alright. Okay?

17:39.045 --> 17:40.241
Okay.

17:47.915 --> 17:51.153
David, you are feeling guilty
about a decision you made years ago.

17:51.416 --> 17:52.402
No.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.110
It's good that you feel guilty.

17:56.098 --> 17:58.641
You do your best work
when you're feeling guilty.

18:40.618 --> 18:43.593
There's a one megabase
inversion on chromosome 13.

18:43.766 --> 18:46.840
Part of the little boy's
DNA is turned backwards.

18:47.057 --> 18:49.833
- What does that mean?
- Genetic abnormality?

18:50.716 --> 18:51.980
Could be.

18:52.705 --> 18:55.212
Has this inversion ever been
written up by anybody before?

18:55.418 --> 18:56.822
Not that I know of.

18:56.927 --> 18:59.343
Is there a disease related
to that part of our DNA?

18:59.496 --> 19:01.353
I can look into it.

19:01.607 --> 19:03.422
- Okay.
- It'll take some time.

19:03.907 --> 19:05.991
Okay, we're talking about
a rare genetic disorder.

19:06.156 --> 19:08.492
You are going to have to look
at the family's DNA history.

19:08.686 --> 19:11.313
- It's just the one little boy?
- So far.

19:11.747 --> 19:14.760
Well, what if there's more?
Has anybody checked into that?

19:14.935 --> 19:17.160
If there is more than one,
it could still be genetic.

19:17.316 --> 19:19.443
Or not. I mean
we're talking about Fox Sound,

19:19.527 --> 19:21.613
it's a little fishing village.
They live off the sea.

19:21.988 --> 19:24.653
What if, you know,
it's something in the food chain?

19:24.748 --> 19:28.272
What if the GMO fish are corrupting other
species that we don't even know about?

19:29.056 --> 19:30.680
- What?
- You want to check every fish

19:30.837 --> 19:33.791
- and crustacean off the coast of Newfoundland?
- OK, not every one but...

19:33.986 --> 19:36.213
Knock yourself out. I just
think you're wasting your time.

19:36.386 --> 19:37.682
What about the GMO halibut?

19:38.206 --> 19:40.922
I checked its DNA against the
wild halibut on the database.

19:41.128 --> 19:42.813
Only one significant change.

19:43.255 --> 19:44.533
What did they modify?

19:44.705 --> 19:46.622
Just what they said
they were going to modify.

19:46.707 --> 19:48.220
In the addition to the
growth hormone gene,

19:48.308 --> 19:49.950
they added
a strong promoter.

19:50.987 --> 19:52.352
No. Here, here.

19:52.827 --> 19:54.062
And they switched it "on",

19:54.148 --> 19:56.022
suddenly the fish started
pumping out growth hormone.

19:56.105 --> 19:58.063
Which is exactly what
they were supposed to do.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.241
- Hi!
- Hi, quarantine girl.

20:01.357 --> 20:02.552
- Hey, Jill! Hi!
- Hi Bob.

20:02.738 --> 20:05.052
Your welcome home dinner can
now be served. Oh, thank you.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.781
Oh, hang on one sec.
David..

20:08.246 --> 20:09.362
Hi.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.583
- Hey!
- Dad?

20:13.166 --> 20:15.443
- What's for dinner?
- How did you get here?

20:15.595 --> 20:17.083
- Cab.
- By yourself?

20:18.196 --> 20:19.042
Cab driver.

20:19.535 --> 20:21.711
Ah, right. Come in, come in.

20:21.835 --> 20:24.211
You met everybody.
You know Mayko and Bob.

20:24.427 --> 20:27.880
- This is Jill Langston, Carlos Serrano.
- It's nice to meet you.

20:28.146 --> 20:29.732
- Come in.
- Lamb shanks!

20:35.968 --> 20:37.972
What I'm saying is that most
of the stuff isn't even...

20:38.097 --> 20:41.403
Okay, we don't know what
the effects of these foods would be on...

20:41.715 --> 20:44.390
- Slow down!
- ... on the average person.

20:44.757 --> 20:46.433
- She's got a point.
- Thank you.

20:46.696 --> 20:49.680
Look, think about it,
if we take a gene from an animal

20:49.825 --> 20:51.770
and splice it with what...?
A tomato plant.

20:51.916 --> 20:55.280
- OK, that's really a little extreme.
- Will you let me finish, please?

20:55.438 --> 20:58.782
No, look, we've been eating
GMO soybeans for years, right?

20:59.118 --> 21:02.170
And corn. This little cotton shirt
is probably genetically modified.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.123
None of us have six toes.

21:04.346 --> 21:07.513
David, you know that none of those studies
have ever proven that GMOs are safe!

21:07.625 --> 21:09.720
- Are you hiding an extra digit?
- Maybe.

21:09.956 --> 21:11.340
I'll look later.
The point is,

21:11.435 --> 21:14.303
there's no evidence to
suggest that GMOs are unsafe.

21:14.447 --> 21:17.013
- is what I'm saying.
- David, there is no evidence

21:17.108 --> 21:18.933
that thalidomide would harm fetuses.

21:19.026 --> 21:22.022
A safe morning sickness pill
turned into a genetic nightmare.

21:28.226 --> 21:30.110
My point is,
we don't know for sure, okay?

21:30.297 --> 21:31.862
We're not going to know
for sure for years!

21:31.958 --> 21:35.402
You call yourself a scientist?
Your point is completely emotion-based.

21:35.746 --> 21:39.040
Mayko, biotech companies are about
growing food, growing more nutritious food

21:39.125 --> 21:41.360
and at the same time,
safeguarding the environment.

21:41.515 --> 21:44.632
Gracias amigo. GMOs are here to stay,
they are the future.

21:45.136 --> 21:47.511
- That's a load of horseshit.
- Excuse me?

21:48.218 --> 21:49.140
What you're not considering

21:49.337 --> 21:52.683
is that this technology invariably
goes where it wasn't meant to.

21:52.825 --> 21:54.981
Dad, I consider that
all the time, that's my job.

21:55.145 --> 21:57.171
- Really then, you should know...
- Do your homework.

21:57.376 --> 21:59.712
that GMO fish escape
from the farms and mate in the wild.

21:59.866 --> 22:01.520
- Yes...
- Pollen from GMO farms...

22:01.767 --> 22:04.432
- drift to non-GMO crops.
- Yes. Yes. That can happen

22:04.608 --> 22:06.592
- but there are safeguards--
- Okay, and also millions

22:06.728 --> 22:09.360
of dollars are spent lobbying
the Drug and Food Administration

22:09.447 --> 22:12.033
to prevent the labelling of GMO foods.

22:12.875 --> 22:15.370
So if it's so safe, then
what are they trying to hide?

22:16.596 --> 22:18.122
Because  we are the guinea pigs

22:18.207 --> 22:20.603
in the biggest science experiment, ever.

22:20.877 --> 22:23.461
Oh, Jesus Christ. Okay,
you know what, you're right.

22:23.647 --> 22:26.831
You're right. You're absolutely
right, it's all one big conspiracy.

22:26.926 --> 22:29.060
And when I come back,
I will regale you

22:29.196 --> 22:31.772
with the time the Grays kidnapped me

22:32.056 --> 22:34.430
and took me up to the mothership.

22:35.358 --> 22:36.302
Guinea pigs.

22:40.227 --> 22:41.271
Okay, I'm sorry,

22:41.356 --> 22:43.713
I have to know.
What was he like as a kid?

22:44.916 --> 22:48.772
David...
emerged from the womb fully formed.

22:50.428 --> 22:51.862
He was arrogant, brilliant,

22:52.118 --> 22:53.442
charming.

22:53.626 --> 22:56.351
It's taken him far
and it's held him back.

22:56.777 --> 22:58.423
He got it all from me.

23:00.125 --> 23:02.372
Let's hope that's
all he gets from me.

23:03.846 --> 23:05.660
So, Megan...

23:06.417 --> 23:08.023
- Oh... Mayko.
- Tell me...

23:08.198 --> 23:10.422
how long have you
and my son been married?

23:27.486 --> 23:29.610
Hey, Earl Jordan?

23:29.906 --> 23:31.442
Yeah, David Sandstrom.

23:31.526 --> 23:33.572
- Who?
- David Sandstrom.

23:33.876 --> 23:35.690
- You're kidding.
- Nope.

23:36.155 --> 23:38.951
- Listen, we did some tests.
- I appreciate that, Doc.

23:39.037 --> 23:41.203
All I can tell you is
that we didn't find anything

23:41.285 --> 23:43.450
linking the GMO fish
to your sons' problems.

23:43.607 --> 23:46.002
No... It's gotta be the fish.

23:46.085 --> 23:47.502
It's the only thing
that's changed up there

23:47.666 --> 23:48.902
<i>in the last four years...</i>

23:49.027 --> 23:51.093
What can I tell you, Earl,
we didn't find anything.

23:51.328 --> 23:52.370
<i>I have.</i>

23:52.717 --> 23:53.782
My son.

23:54.808 --> 23:58.061
<i>So... what am I supposed
to tell his mother, then?</i>

23:58.568 --> 24:02.570
You asked me to look into the GMOs
and give you my opinion and I did, okay?

24:02.816 --> 24:05.141
So that's it then.
You're in the clear.

24:06.655 --> 24:08.100
Thanks for the call.

24:08.455 --> 24:10.540
Wait. Earl?

24:12.886 --> 24:16.072
What your son does have is...

24:16.305 --> 24:17.972
genetic irregularities.

24:18.845 --> 24:21.741
There's a section of his DNA
that seems to be turned around.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.123
Turned around?

24:23.318 --> 24:25.203
Why? How?

24:26.197 --> 24:28.752
<i>We don't know. I mean...
That would take a lot more work.</i>

24:28.966 --> 24:30.322
You're looking into it?

24:30.678 --> 24:32.562
Yeah, we're looking into it.

24:33.106 --> 24:35.662
<i>I appreciate it, Dr. Sandstrom.
You know that.</i>

24:36.397 --> 24:37.653
I do, Earl.

24:37.887 --> 24:38.831
I do.

24:44.355 --> 24:47.373
Yeah, I'm looking
for children who exhibit

24:47.478 --> 24:49.950
a palsy-like paralysis,
but who remain undiagnosed.

24:50.147 --> 24:52.890
Well, if you know of anyone in any
of the outports of the Burin Peninsula,

24:53.146 --> 24:54.440
could you let me know?

24:54.868 --> 24:56.912
Yeah... Any other symptoms?

24:57.617 --> 25:00.153
Can you just send me
everything you have?

25:02.246 --> 25:03.750
Yeah, blood would be great.

25:03.948 --> 25:05.332
This is Mayko Tran from...

25:06.627 --> 25:08.960
It sounds like you
have your hands full.

25:09.366 --> 25:12.202
Yeah. I got your name
from Dr. Moorhead...

25:13.158 --> 25:14.880
Oh! Okay good.

25:15.227 --> 25:18.050
Yeah. Well, I understand that...

25:22.005 --> 25:24.693
Okay, so none of the kids
have the exact same symptoms,

25:24.857 --> 25:26.493
and Earl's kid has it the worst.

25:26.647 --> 25:29.161
But a lot of them seem to have
muscle development problems.

25:29.247 --> 25:30.933
So I think I might have
something here.

25:31.047 --> 25:34.192
But there are two others I want to check
in on. Henry Harbour and Scott's Bay.

25:34.278 --> 25:36.160
You want to tell me why
this isn't a wild goose chase?

25:36.695 --> 25:40.280
OK, well if this is one in a million,
you want to tell me why

25:40.475 --> 25:42.563
there are kids at either
side of the same peninsula?

25:42.687 --> 25:45.333
Some guy in San Francisco once
won the lottery twice in one day.

25:45.458 --> 25:48.011
What about the rest of these kids,
what if they have the genetic inversion?

25:48.118 --> 25:49.512
What are the odds of that?

25:51.348 --> 25:54.113
Okay, here's what we need to do.
Medical records on all the kids.

25:54.288 --> 25:56.132
- DNA from all the families.
- It'll be here tomorrow.

25:56.727 --> 25:58.503
And a lot more seafood.

25:58.606 --> 26:01.153
I got samples from the fishermen
from all around the Fox Sound area.

26:01.295 --> 26:03.591
You are not giving up
on this whole GMO link, are you?

26:03.768 --> 26:06.303
David look, I checked into their
dietary patterns, okay?

26:06.467 --> 26:09.573
And on average 75%
of their food intake

26:09.695 --> 26:11.523
comes from the sea.

26:11.607 --> 26:14.193
Come on, don't you think we should take
another look at what they're eating?

26:14.275 --> 26:17.250
Absolutely. If there's something
in the food that's causing all this

26:17.366 --> 26:20.540
we need to find out what it is.
But it's not the GMO fish.

26:40.608 --> 26:42.502
Ah! New cologne, Wes?

26:43.398 --> 26:46.142
- Does someone write those for you?
- No. You just inspire me.

26:46.435 --> 26:49.233
- Okay, so here's what I got--
- Let's get the whole gang in on this...

26:49.388 --> 26:51.582
Wes, why don't you be a doll,
go round up the usual suspects,

26:51.716 --> 26:53.432
tell them to meet us
in the conference room.

26:55.407 --> 26:57.163
Let me show you something.

27:03.958 --> 27:06.500
All department heads to
the conference room please.

27:06.686 --> 27:09.502
That's not half as much fun as watching
you running around looking for people.

27:09.897 --> 27:10.991
It is for me.

27:15.047 --> 27:16.363
So what's on the menu?

27:16.617 --> 27:18.363
Okay... I've got lobster,

27:18.556 --> 27:19.920
cod, halibut,

27:20.025 --> 27:21.921
squid, mussels, snow crab,

27:22.095 --> 27:24.123
- human DNA--
- Everything but dessert.

27:24.426 --> 27:25.790
Come on.

27:30.427 --> 27:32.471
I'm sorry, Caroline.
But this seems to take priority

27:32.625 --> 27:34.911
- over the Appropriations Committee.
- What happened?

27:35.526 --> 27:37.723
Actually, it's more
about what's happening.

27:40.658 --> 27:42.060
Last week...

27:42.376 --> 27:44.321
a National Guard unit in Canton, Ohio,

27:44.485 --> 27:46.361
was doing a routine endurance course.

27:46.575 --> 27:48.403
These are troops ramping up for Iraq.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.443
Excellent condition.

27:50.966 --> 27:53.031
They all came down
with the same symptoms.

27:53.218 --> 27:55.282
Double vision,
upper body weakness,

27:55.408 --> 27:57.682
- muscle pain.
- How many are we talking about?

27:57.805 --> 27:59.652
23 men. 7 women.

27:59.926 --> 28:01.841
They're not
responding to any treatment.

28:02.197 --> 28:04.261
I got an update
just before you arrived.

28:04.638 --> 28:06.783
Five appear to be comatose.

28:07.265 --> 28:09.023
Any clue what
we're dealing with?

28:09.456 --> 28:12.102
Homeland Security is hearing chatter.

28:12.436 --> 28:14.951
Credible threats by a
group linked to Al-Qaeda.

28:15.365 --> 28:18.752
More or less to the effect they're
going to attack "America's Heartland".

28:19.026 --> 28:20.800
Okay, any evidence this is connected?

28:21.095 --> 28:24.821
We have every reason to believe
there is a cell operating in Ohio.

28:25.327 --> 28:27.150
- Any leads on that?
- We're checking into it.

28:27.387 --> 28:28.232
Vigorously.

28:29.357 --> 28:31.583
FBI! Put your hands
where I can see them!

28:31.987 --> 28:33.490
- What are you doing?
- Don't move!

28:34.235 --> 28:35.563
- What's going on?
- Stay calm!

28:36.095 --> 28:38.641
I can have my people
working on this immediately.

28:39.038 --> 28:39.962
Good.

28:41.758 --> 28:43.493
I'm not signing this.

28:43.677 --> 28:45.721
It's just a standard
release form absolving NorBAC

28:45.877 --> 28:47.911
of any responsibility
for your accident.

28:48.218 --> 28:49.340
- Jill.
- Yeah?

28:49.615 --> 28:51.412
We're waiting for you
in the conference room.

28:51.836 --> 28:53.050
Okay, I'll be right there.

28:53.208 --> 28:55.571
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, it's fine.

28:55.786 --> 28:57.661
- ASAP.
- Okay.

28:58.917 --> 29:00.681
It wasn't an accident.

29:00.878 --> 29:02.983
An accident implies
I made a mistake

29:03.105 --> 29:06.232
- and I did not make a mistake.
- That's not the general consensus.

29:06.437 --> 29:08.400
I don't give a shit
about the general consensus.

29:08.557 --> 29:10.551
- I did not fuck up.
- Jill, what difference does it make?

29:10.845 --> 29:13.320
Mistakes were made.
You were exposed to an unknown retrovirus.

29:13.458 --> 29:16.282
I need you to sign these forms
that NorBAC is not legally responsible.

29:16.748 --> 29:18.502
You think I'm going to sue you?

29:20.097 --> 29:21.702
I don't know what
you're going to do, Jill.

29:22.247 --> 29:24.411
Jesus! Wes, I'll tell you what.
I'll sign those papers

29:24.546 --> 29:26.693
as soon as you start
doing your job around here.

29:26.836 --> 29:28.720
- And what is that supposed to mean?
- That means:

29:28.867 --> 29:30.333
figure out why things
are going missing.

29:30.508 --> 29:33.031
Find out who's fucking around
with my lab equipment.

29:33.237 --> 29:36.992
Actually manage the lab instead of
covering your ass with release forms.

29:37.267 --> 29:39.413
- Jill!
- Save it. I got a meeting.

29:40.927 --> 29:42.683
Here. Here's the background.

29:43.715 --> 29:46.321
Basically, we got a group of kids
with muscle development problems.

29:46.428 --> 29:48.222
We're looking into
their family histories,

29:48.377 --> 29:50.521
DNA samples, all of that.

29:50.668 --> 29:52.251
When do you expect
to receive them?

29:52.467 --> 29:54.630
- It's right here.
- Ah! OK.

29:55.078 --> 29:58.673
I'll start running the DNA
profiles on the new fish samples.

29:58.907 --> 30:02.373
- Bob, you do toxicology?
- I'll run an Ames test, see what I can find.

30:02.608 --> 30:04.923
- Get Jill to help you do it.
- Help you do what?

30:05.087 --> 30:07.593
- Analyze the seafood for any toxins.
- Okay.

30:08.066 --> 30:10.422
I'm going to get an epidemiologist
to look at what I have.

30:10.598 --> 30:14.112
OK, get these DNA samples to Scherer at
Sick Kids. Everybody know what they're doing?

30:14.257 --> 30:16.441
- What are you doing?
- I got some catching up to do.

30:16.988 --> 30:18.663
- Jill...
- Sorry.

30:27.438 --> 30:28.742
Caroline.

30:38.018 --> 30:40.083
- What?
- Hey, David.

30:40.297 --> 30:41.511
There'a military plane

30:41.726 --> 30:44.182
waiting for you at Downsview.
Get there as soon as possible.

30:44.396 --> 30:45.813
Where am I going?

30:46.148 --> 30:47.803
I can't tell you.

30:54.757 --> 30:57.563
NATIONAL GUARD FACILITY, OHIO

31:15.678 --> 31:17.841
These guys aren't
fucking around, are they?

31:17.995 --> 31:19.833
Full quarantine as of last week.

31:19.975 --> 31:22.290
This isn't out to anyone, David.
Next of keen, wives,

31:22.416 --> 31:24.812
parents of soldiers think
they're on a extended exercise.

31:24.947 --> 31:26.433
How many are
we talking about?

31:26.786 --> 31:29.021
Out of 32 members in the unit...

31:29.105 --> 31:32.411
30 are sick, 2 they
don't really know about.

31:32.535 --> 31:34.570
- What are they? AWOL?
- They don't really know.

31:34.655 --> 31:36.831
They haven't reported
to the base in two weeks.

31:51.637 --> 31:53.290
They sleep 24/7.

31:53.387 --> 31:56.323
If we wake 'em, all they want
to do is go back to sleep.

31:56.555 --> 31:57.983
Now some are
slipping into comas.

31:58.216 --> 32:00.192
- Treatment?
- We've tried everything.

32:00.388 --> 32:02.613
- Any success?
- Quiet, isn't it?

32:03.098 --> 32:05.240
OK, we're going
to need a full array of tests.

32:05.435 --> 32:08.380
Find out how contagious it is.
If it's airborne? Waterborne?

32:08.516 --> 32:11.013
- We've already tried that, we got nothing.
- Oh, shit.

32:11.217 --> 32:13.172
We're going to have to take
a look at everything you've got.

32:13.388 --> 32:15.860
Absolutely, I'll show you
where you can work.

32:16.018 --> 32:18.782
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I'd like to talk them if I could.

32:18.995 --> 32:20.523
By all means. Only...

32:20.625 --> 32:22.403
there is only a few
left who can talk to you.

32:34.975 --> 32:36.271
Sam...

32:37.457 --> 32:38.911
Hi, Sam, I'm David.

32:39.015 --> 32:40.682
Can you tell
me how you're feeling?

32:41.735 --> 32:43.340
It's so hot in the...

32:45.415 --> 32:47.011
...Bradley tank.

32:47.696 --> 32:48.973
Hot.

32:49.827 --> 32:52.030
Sam? You're still here.

32:52.147 --> 32:54.640
Where were you?
You said you were in a Bradley?

32:55.888 --> 32:57.212
Desert...

32:58.767 --> 33:00.152
Patrol...

33:00.247 --> 33:02.283
- We...
- What desert?

33:04.107 --> 33:05.812
It's snowing, isn't it?

33:08.628 --> 33:09.752
Yeah...

33:10.148 --> 33:11.672
Yeah, it's snowing.

33:12.128 --> 33:14.070
So you just stay warm, okay?

33:14.325 --> 33:16.131
You'll be all right.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.370
Any of these soldiers have relatives

33:25.508 --> 33:27.850
or friends who are sick
with the same thing?

33:28.377 --> 33:30.283
No, only the guards have symptoms.

33:31.155 --> 33:32.163
Okay.

33:32.538 --> 33:36.330
We're going to need a complete
timetable of everything they did together.

33:36.468 --> 33:39.383
They were on manoeuvers. Not in
contact with anyone but each other.

33:39.545 --> 33:42.903
Well, we're going to have to find
someone who knows what's going on.

33:43.177 --> 33:45.883
Well, that's the problem.
There is only a few left conscious.

33:46.255 --> 33:49.113
Anyone who knows is lying in that room!

33:51.386 --> 33:53.601
- Were these guys in Iraq?
- They weren't.

33:54.857 --> 33:58.253
- Are they all hallucating like this?
- There's some psychosis, yeah.

33:58.526 --> 34:00.010
Besides the psychosis,
what have we got?

34:00.195 --> 34:02.693
Couple of guys came
complaining of headaches,

34:02.776 --> 34:04.601
- flu-like symptoms.
- Fever?

34:04.775 --> 34:06.741
Mild, but then
there was blurred vision,

34:07.355 --> 34:10.350
weak upper body strength,
severe muscle pains.

34:10.505 --> 34:12.132
What about their physical
and mental responses?

34:12.246 --> 34:14.722
Getting slower,
then there was psychosis,

34:14.937 --> 34:17.623
then unconsciousness.
It all happened pretty quickly.

34:17.795 --> 34:20.080
- How quickly?
- From perfect health to this?

34:20.456 --> 34:21.801
Five days.

34:25.304 --> 34:28.989
So we ran DNA profiles on a variety
of different species of the fish.

34:29.465 --> 34:31.223
No obvious abnormalities.

34:31.725 --> 34:34.301
So it's possible that these
kids' chromosomal abnormalities

34:34.456 --> 34:36.061
are linked to inherited diseases.

34:36.337 --> 34:39.190
Okay, but we won't know that for sure
until I get the arrays from Sick Kids'.

34:39.335 --> 34:41.771
Guys I got something.
Bacterial counts for the fish.

34:46.275 --> 34:47.943
<i>- Radiodurans?
- What?</i>

34:48.308 --> 34:50.242
There is a predominance
of a particular species:

34:50.324 --> 34:52.989
<i>- D. Radiodurans.
- What are Radiodurans?</i>

34:53.297 --> 34:55.210
The cockroach of all bacteria.

34:55.648 --> 34:57.830
This shit's going to be around
when the sun swallows us up.

34:57.915 --> 35:00.571
They can fix themselves, even after
being blasted with radioactivity.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.513
Doesn't radioactivity
kill most bacteria?

35:02.716 --> 35:05.041
Exactly, so when you have
an abundance of 'durans,

35:05.186 --> 35:06.802
and little or no other bacteria...

35:06.886 --> 35:08.922
It could mean that there
are high levels of radioactivity.

35:09.138 --> 35:12.150
- Got it, OK.
- And radioactivity has been known

35:12.328 --> 35:14.330
to alter DNA,
cause abnormalities.

35:14.417 --> 35:16.312
But only in high dosages, Bob.

35:16.916 --> 35:18.803
Let's test the fish for radioactivity.

35:19.298 --> 35:20.370
Yeah.

35:22.758 --> 35:24.562
Trace amounts of radioactivity.

35:27.367 --> 35:30.380
- Where are the mussels from?
- Same area as the halibut.

35:30.616 --> 35:32.450
Off the coast of Port Big Horn.

35:33.305 --> 35:35.313
Okay, wait. So, why more
radiation in the mussels?

35:35.628 --> 35:37.410
Well, mussels are natural filters,

35:37.498 --> 35:39.710
trapping whatever passes
through their bodies.

35:40.356 --> 35:42.500
See we have mussels
from all over the peninsula.

35:43.048 --> 35:45.881
We should use them
as our standard measuring tool,

35:46.048 --> 35:48.072
seeing where the
concentrations are the highest.

35:49.028 --> 35:50.242
Okay, let's do it.

35:50.457 --> 35:51.493
Okay.

35:54.055 --> 35:55.500
These are higher.

35:56.097 --> 35:57.880
Off the coast of St. Lawrence.

36:26.517 --> 36:28.690
It's like a roadmap, pointing directly

36:28.817 --> 36:30.512
towards St. Pierre and Miquelon.

36:30.655 --> 36:32.701
Which, as you know,
are part of France.

36:33.157 --> 36:35.412
Yes, thank you, Bob.
Okay, look at this.

36:35.557 --> 36:38.040
These little symbols, right there.
What are those?

36:38.187 --> 36:40.140
- What do they stand for?
- Oil wells.

36:40.225 --> 36:42.853
When oil is dug up in
the ocean, you get NORM.

36:42.938 --> 36:45.400
Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material.

36:45.566 --> 36:47.811
So could that be where
the radiation originates from?

36:48.156 --> 36:49.972
No, the radiation is too high.

36:50.088 --> 36:51.441
Okay, so what else?

36:51.775 --> 36:53.763
I'm not a specialist in nuclear biology

36:53.865 --> 36:56.262
but I'd say we'd have to
be looking for something,

36:56.438 --> 36:58.821
- concentrations of--
- Oh shit, Bob.

36:58.978 --> 37:01.711
Are you saying that
something was dumped there?

37:03.776 --> 37:06.860
Okay, so who do we go after? Who are
the biggest shits in the nuclear world?

37:07.406 --> 37:08.530
Russians?

37:08.828 --> 37:10.022
Americans?

37:10.756 --> 37:11.893
No.

37:12.035 --> 37:13.370
Oh, my God.

37:14.386 --> 37:15.690
French.

37:16.138 --> 37:17.803
Comatose soldiers.
What do we got?

37:18.018 --> 37:20.260
So I spoke with Gary Katz,
at the Mayo Clinic.

37:20.356 --> 37:22.340
One of the best
diagnosticians out there

37:22.487 --> 37:24.262
- and he didn't have a clue.
- Blood work?

37:24.388 --> 37:26.412
The white blood
cell count is sky high.

37:26.568 --> 37:29.693
Cytokines also way up there.
The immune system is in overdrive.

37:29.957 --> 37:31.482
It's definitely an infection.

37:31.637 --> 37:33.093
- Bacterial?
- I doubt it.

37:33.215 --> 37:34.702
What about virology?

37:35.015 --> 37:37.760
Well we scanned for all
known viruses: nothing.

37:37.976 --> 37:39.232
But here's a weird one:

37:39.407 --> 37:41.870
we found what looked like
weak hits on all the retroviruses.

37:42.088 --> 37:43.660
Can't tell if it's background or what?

37:43.848 --> 37:46.410
Do you think something in
the blood could be cross-reacting

37:46.518 --> 37:48.600
- with retroviruses on the array?
- Maybe.

37:48.755 --> 37:51.253
- Maybe you didn't clean off the array very well.
- True.

37:51.586 --> 37:53.623
All right. Let's
assume it's a retrovirus.

37:53.706 --> 37:55.460
- Okay.
- If it is, we might find a cause

37:55.625 --> 37:57.903
for this syndrome.
So let's keep looking at that angle.

37:58.546 --> 37:59.761
Thanks guys.

37:59.977 --> 38:02.780
<i>- David, when are you coming back?
- Why, what's up?</i>

38:02.996 --> 38:06.010
<i>Well, we think we may have something
on the problem in Newfoundland.</i>

38:06.178 --> 38:07.120
What?

38:07.358 --> 38:09.071
Radioactivity in the fish.

38:09.218 --> 38:11.621
<i>Bob and Mayko think they have
a line on where it's coming from.</i>

38:11.827 --> 38:13.723
Enough to cause damage
to the genetic code?

38:13.896 --> 38:15.753
You're gonna have to
convince me of that one guys.

38:16.278 --> 38:17.493
<i>We're working on it.</i>

38:17.768 --> 38:19.290
All right, I'll be back tonight.

38:20.695 --> 38:22.503
- Ready to go?
- Yeah, let's do it.

38:49.995 --> 38:52.041
- You don't have any food!
- Jesus!

38:54.615 --> 38:55.952
Shit, Dad.

38:57.055 --> 39:00.633
You know, don't be surprised
if they put a bolt on your door.

39:05.355 --> 39:06.843
What you got there?

39:08.127 --> 39:10.001
I went looking for matches.

39:11.437 --> 39:13.441
I found this in your desk.

39:17.967 --> 39:19.293
You know, it's funny...

39:19.435 --> 39:20.900
I can get lost

39:21.058 --> 39:23.012
between my suite
and the dining hall.

39:25.975 --> 39:28.193
I memorized this piece of paper in...

39:28.395 --> 39:29.613
ten minutes.

39:31.566 --> 39:32.950
You know
what it says?

39:33.757 --> 39:35.532
I already know.

39:37.088 --> 39:38.122
"To Dad.

39:39.568 --> 39:43.002
I am taking Mom someplace better

39:43.476 --> 39:46.020
so you can never make
her feel bad again.

39:48.116 --> 39:50.320
You treat us like a big monster.

39:52.106 --> 39:54.031
You breathe fire...

39:54.286 --> 39:55.580
that hurts us.

39:57.116 --> 39:59.633
I want to pick up a big sword

40:00.236 --> 40:02.001
and cut your head off.

40:03.547 --> 40:05.461
But I don't have one,

40:07.088 --> 40:08.880
so goodbye.

40:10.028 --> 40:11.711
I hate you.

40:12.927 --> 40:14.843
From David."

40:22.495 --> 40:24.131
What did I do?

40:29.097 --> 40:30.941
It doesn't matter anymore.

40:35.036 --> 40:37.181
I was such a selfish prick.

40:39.546 --> 40:43.142
It was always about me.
I never thought anything else mattered.

40:47.365 --> 40:48.920
I miss your mother.

40:52.808 --> 40:54.112
Me too, Dad.

40:55.338 --> 40:57.460
I wish it could
have been me instead.

41:14.007 --> 41:15.823
I'm glad you're here, Dad.

41:20.895 --> 41:23.271
I have Alzheimer's disease.

41:23.755 --> 41:25.191
I know.

41:27.356 --> 41:28.771
I don't want it.

41:30.225 --> 41:33.432
I don't want to just fade away...

41:33.925 --> 41:36.613
as somebody no one recognizes.

41:46.027 --> 41:48.572
I don't want you to have it either.

42:21.757 --> 42:23.110
<i>From perfect health to this.</i>

42:23.357 --> 42:25.160
<i>Getting slower...
There's some psychosis. </i>

42:25.375 --> 42:27.152
<i>They came complaining
of headaches, flu-like symptoms. </i>

42:27.316 --> 42:29.073
<i>It all happened pretty quickly.
There was blurred vision,</i>

42:29.266 --> 42:32.032
<i>weak upper body strength,
severe muscle pain, unconsciousness. </i>

42:39.837 --> 42:41.550
Fuck, go away.

42:42.016 --> 42:44.162
Can't you at least say please?

42:44.868 --> 42:47.740
This thing is driving me crazy.
Everybody says there's no such disease.

42:47.906 --> 42:49.623
But I have seen this
somewhere before.

42:49.815 --> 42:51.633
Two of the soldiers
flatlined last night.

42:51.847 --> 42:53.683
They got 'em back
but it's not looking good.

42:53.788 --> 42:55.970
I'm working on it, Caroline.
You're not helping.

42:56.166 --> 42:58.352
Yeah, you're working on it
but what's your staff doing?

42:58.547 --> 43:00.793
- They're on it.
- What does a map of Newfoundland

43:00.946 --> 43:03.790
and a bunch of fish have to do
with 30 sick National Guardsmen?

43:05.395 --> 43:06.981
Ah, fuck. What, Bob?

43:07.275 --> 43:09.053
I know you're thinking and busy,

43:09.235 --> 43:11.283
but do you just have
a minute for the other thing?

43:12.325 --> 43:14.282
A minute is about
all you have, David.

43:14.498 --> 43:16.441
Look, I told you about
this in your office.

43:17.085 --> 43:18.943
No, we said
we'd talk about it later.

43:19.116 --> 43:21.032
Well, I've had my mind
on other things.

43:21.805 --> 43:23.540
Talk to me now.

43:25.606 --> 43:27.070
I'll be right there, Bob.

43:31.855 --> 43:33.862
I was looking into GMO fish,

43:33.985 --> 43:35.742
to see if they were fucking people up!

43:35.995 --> 43:37.460
- And?
- They're not.

43:37.858 --> 43:39.863
We don't know what it is.
I'm still looking.

43:40.168 --> 43:42.500
Tell your staff this is
going on the back burner.

43:44.427 --> 43:46.232
Why don't we
tell them together?

43:46.418 --> 43:47.420
Sure.

43:51.766 --> 43:53.312
Greenpeace had it all.

43:54.406 --> 43:57.181
Well we're going to have
to put it on hold for a while.

43:57.406 --> 43:59.273
Put it on hold,
that doesn't make any sense.

43:59.476 --> 44:02.642
We know where the nuclear rods are,
we need to get them out of there before--

44:02.915 --> 44:05.082
Bob, we've got more important
things to think about right now.

44:05.377 --> 44:07.750
I would say a completely
contaminated food chain

44:07.896 --> 44:09.900
is kind of important
to deal with, David.

44:10.075 --> 44:12.032
- Yeah, well, Mayko.
- Mayko's got a point.

44:12.557 --> 44:14.831
You really want us
to stop working on this.

44:15.827 --> 44:17.041
Caroline?

44:20.747 --> 44:22.651
Okay, I'll make some calls.

44:22.795 --> 44:25.713
I'll make the French
aware of the problem,

44:26.237 --> 44:28.521
ask them to clean up
after themselves

44:28.677 --> 44:30.983
and then... then we refocus.

44:31.355 --> 44:32.830
It's not that simple.

44:32.955 --> 44:35.833
There was a territorial dispute
with France over the islands and

44:36.026 --> 44:38.181
the Canadians took it
to an arbitration panel.

44:38.418 --> 44:41.183
So in 1992,
Canada won the territorial waters

44:41.296 --> 44:43.033
where the French dumped the fuel rods.

44:43.175 --> 44:45.091
The French won't clean up something

44:45.266 --> 44:46.873
that isn't in their waters.

44:47.088 --> 44:48.843
Okay, I'll deal with it...
I'll deal with it,

44:48.966 --> 44:51.472
and I want you all to deal with
an immobilized National Guard unit.

44:51.637 --> 44:54.243
- Caroline, we can't do both.
- I know you can't, David.

44:54.368 --> 44:57.672
But just think what you can
do if you focused on one thing.

44:58.487 --> 45:00.342
Right. You're absolutely right.

45:00.477 --> 45:01.813
Thank you.

45:06.176 --> 45:08.050
Good work, guys.
Okay, here's the deal.

45:08.148 --> 45:10.892
I don't think we've got enough radiation
to cause what we're talking about here

45:10.978 --> 45:14.061
and if we did have enough radiation, why isn't
everyone showing the same symptoms, you know?

45:14.185 --> 45:16.443
Why isn't everyone
showing signs of radiation sickness?

45:16.617 --> 45:18.621
Nausea, exhaustion, hair loss.

45:19.928 --> 45:20.893
You're right.

45:21.545 --> 45:25.180
You've got to look at the symptoms.
The symptoms don't lie.

45:28.206 --> 45:30.080
The symptoms, shit!

45:33.258 --> 45:35.073
- Jill!
- Yeah?

45:35.235 --> 45:37.312
I need your brain on this National
Guardmen's thing for a second.

45:37.438 --> 45:41.180
- OK. What's up?
- Symptoms, OK, we just keep an open mind,

45:41.418 --> 45:44.530
but we got headaches,
flu-like symptoms, mild fever.

45:45.157 --> 45:48.171
That turns into
muscle pain, slow physical

45:48.347 --> 45:51.682
and mental responses, sleepiness, right?

45:52.395 --> 45:54.701
- Okay.
- Sleepiness into coma.

45:55.457 --> 45:57.143
- Coma?
- Yeah...

45:59.986 --> 46:01.590
<i>Encephalitis Lethargica?</i>

46:01.728 --> 46:05.212
Highly contagious. Over 5 million
people got it, no one ever figured it out.

46:05.367 --> 46:08.692
No. David, it hasn't
been around since 1928.

46:08.818 --> 46:10.943
Spanish flu hadn't been
around for a long time, either.

46:16.166 --> 46:18.951
If Al Qaeda's got it and you're right...

46:19.436 --> 46:20.712
We're screwed.

46:31.725 --> 46:33.510
Yes, Sir.

46:33.937 --> 46:35.110
It's Wes.

46:37.226 --> 46:38.351
I see.

46:39.065 --> 46:40.301
I will.

46:41.096 --> 46:42.430
Yes, Sir.

46:43.756 --> 46:47.582
- Is that the DNA for the National Guard?
- No, for the Newfoundland families.

46:48.046 --> 46:49.980
I thought we were finished with that?

46:52.618 --> 46:54.120
Apparently not.

46:54.295 --> 46:56.190
So, the fish couldn't have
caused a genetic mutation.

46:56.457 --> 46:59.291
- No.
- And the nuclear rods were dumped in the 1950s?

46:59.375 --> 47:01.711
So the radiation didn't
cause any damage either.

47:01.865 --> 47:04.473
I believe this meeting
is called: "the Ohio virus".

47:04.595 --> 47:06.452
Guardsmen.
They're getting better.

47:08.936 --> 47:11.290
- What?
- What, you've got the cure?

47:11.588 --> 47:14.562
I do, indeed. I just
don't know what it was we did cure.

47:14.737 --> 47:17.890
I would really love to take a look at
what's in that vial. Can you get up here?

47:18.028 --> 47:20.191
I am just as interested
in this as you are, Doctor.

47:20.446 --> 47:22.821
- I can be up there tomorrow.
- Great, I'll see you then.

47:23.295 --> 47:25.240
David, I'm having a
hard time finding Henshaw.

47:25.525 --> 47:28.133
The guy has a cure for
Lethargica, Wes. Just find him.

47:28.285 --> 47:30.373
- Something strange is going on.
- And that is?

47:30.627 --> 47:32.962
We keep getting hits
on the same piece of DNA.

47:33.108 --> 47:34.961
It looks harmless,
but all the Guardsmen,

47:35.097 --> 47:38.711
their bodies are producing the same
obscure DNA fragment over and over again.

47:38.835 --> 47:39.663
Altered?

47:40.077 --> 47:42.530
<i>- You mean weaponized?
- They make the perfect weapon.</i>

47:42.767 --> 47:45.600
Something we've ignored
for the better part of a century.

47:45.966 --> 47:48.931
Something we haven't
got a clue how to fight.

47:49.845 --> 47:52.163
Things are getting a
little tense inside the lab.

47:52.428 --> 47:53.842
Everyone's working hard.

47:53.938 --> 47:55.880
So make sure you log in
for this week's mission.

47:56.355 --> 47:57.912
I'm counting on you.

47:58.098 --> 48:00.451

only you know the whole story.
