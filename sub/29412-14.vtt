Shaun is incapable
of deceit.

31:49.375 --> 31:52.078
He must have
genuinely thought
that you wouldn't mind.

31:52.111 --> 31:55.347
Well, then, he is completely
tone deaf and insensitive,

31:55.381 --> 31:57.849
which are not better qualities
in a boyfriend.

31:57.883 --> 31:58.917
True.

unanticipated

I am not jealous.

You don't need to justify.
I'm on team jealousy.

32:16.735 --> 32:19.705
It's flattering,
stimulating, it...

32:19.738 --> 32:21.507
It means you're committed
and you care.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.976
It's ugly and reflects
underlying trust issues

32:24.010 --> 32:25.077

and a lot will kill you.

32:28.814 --> 32:29.815

32:31.350 --> 32:33.619
Admit you're jealous,
give in to it,

was a success.

She had a cerebral ischemia.

could hang in the balance.

is also at stake.

This is an easy call.

There's only one reason
to tell her everything,

35:30.962 --> 35:33.332

feel guilty if you don't.

35:33.365 --> 35:36.034

No.

Dr. Murphy, I hope
you will limit your answers.

we'll begin her on statins

It's kind of like
dialysis,

to extract LDL
out of her blood.

Should get her cholesterol
to within normal range.
