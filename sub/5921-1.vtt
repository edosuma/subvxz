00:17.207 --> 00:22.568
Alice in Wonderland

00:23.610 --> 00:27.128
How do you get to Wonderland

00:27.213 --> 00:31.209
Over the hill or under land

00:31.296 --> 00:34.290
Orjust behind the tree

00:35.499 --> 00:39.541
When clouds go rolling by

00:39.622 --> 00:43.537
They roll away and leave the sky

00:43.624 --> 00:47.336
Where is the land beyond the eye

00:47.427 --> 00:50.819
That people cannot see

00:52.190 --> 00:54.831
Where can it be

00:55.873 --> 00:59.551
Where do stars go

00:59.636 --> 01:03.108
Where is the grass that blooms

01:03.198 --> 01:07.160
They must be somewhere

01:07.241 --> 01:11.556
Where is the sunny afternoon

01:13.365 --> 01:17.964
Alice in Wonderland

01:19.289 --> 01:22.807
Where is the path to Wonderland

01:24.133 --> 01:30.452
Over the hill or here or there

01:30.537 --> 01:35.979
I wonder

01:36.061 --> 01:37.973
Where

01:53.233 --> 01:56.193
"... for if he does
and had been of late...

01:56.276 --> 02:00.351
"much accustomed to
usurpation and conquest.

02:00.438 --> 02:04.320
"Edwin and Morcar, the earls
of Mercia and Northumbria,

02:04.401 --> 02:08.282
declared for him,
and even Stigand-"

02:08.363 --> 02:11.163
- Alice.
- Hmm?

02:11.245 --> 02:14.045
- Oh, I'm listening.
- "And even Stigand,

02:14.127 --> 02:17.840
"the Archbishop of Canterbury,
agreed to meet with William...

02:17.930 --> 02:19.762
and offer him the Crown. "

02:20.892 --> 02:23.328
"William's conduct
at first was model-"

02:23.414 --> 02:27.889
Alice. Will you kindly
pay attention to your history lesson?

02:27.977 --> 02:30.813
I'm sorry, but how can one
possibly pay attention...

02:30.899 --> 02:32.731
to a book with
no pictures in it?

02:32.821 --> 02:34.653
My dear child,

02:34.742 --> 02:38.579
there are a great many good books
in this world without pictures.

02:38.665 --> 02:42.103
In this world, perhaps,
but in my world,

02:42.188 --> 02:44.578
the books would be
nothing but pictures.

02:44.669 --> 02:47.310
Your world? Huh!
What nonsense.

02:47.391 --> 02:49.781
- Now, once more.
- Nonsense?

02:49.872 --> 02:51.352
- From the beginning.
- That's it, Dinah.

02:52.195 --> 02:55.792
If I had a world of my own,
everything would be nonsense.

02:55.877 --> 02:57.949
Nothing would be
what it is,

02:58.039 --> 03:00.270
because everything would be
what it isn't,

03:00.360 --> 03:04.116
and contrariwise,
what it is, it wouldn't be.

03:04.202 --> 03:06.673
And what it wouldn't be,
it would.

03:06.764 --> 03:09.326
You see?

03:09.407 --> 03:12.559
In my world, you
wouldn't say "meow. "

03:12.648 --> 03:16.087
You'd say,
"Yes, Miss Alice. "

03:16.171 --> 03:19.165
Oh, but you would. You'd be
just like people, Dinah.

03:19.253 --> 03:21.529
And all the other
animals too.

03:21.615 --> 03:23.447
Why, in my world:

03:23.536 --> 03:25.607
Cats and rabbits

03:25.697 --> 03:29.740
Would reside in
fancy little houses

03:29.820 --> 03:34.022
And be dressed in shoes
and hats and trousers

03:35.624 --> 03:40.018
In a world
of my own

03:40.107 --> 03:42.179
All the flowers

03:42.269 --> 03:46.345
Would have very
extra-special powers

03:46.432 --> 03:48.549
They would sit
and talk to me

03:48.633 --> 03:52.026
For hours,
when I'm lonely

03:52.116 --> 03:55.414
In a world
of my own

03:55.449 --> 03:58.711
There'd be new birds

03:58.800 --> 04:02.842
Lots of nice and friendly
how-de-do birds

04:02.923 --> 04:07.842
Everyone would have
a dozen bluebirds

04:07.927 --> 04:10.727
Within that world

04:10.809 --> 04:13.119
Of my own

04:13.210 --> 04:15.248
I could listen

04:15.332 --> 04:17.642
To a babbling brook

04:17.733 --> 04:23.415
And hear a song that
I could understand

04:23.498 --> 04:26.412
I keep wishing

04:26.500 --> 04:29.813
It could be that way

04:29.903 --> 04:32.783
Because my world would be

04:32.865 --> 04:37.383
A wonderland.

04:48.155 --> 04:52.949
Oh, Dinah. It's just a rabbit
with a waistcoat- and a watch!

04:53.039 --> 04:55.429
Oh, my fur and whiskers!
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!

04:55.520 --> 04:59.881
Now this is curious. What could
a rabbit possibly be late for?

04:59.964 --> 05:02.399
- Please, sir!
- I'm late, I'm late

05:02.485 --> 05:05.206
For a very important date
No time to say hello, Goodbye

05:05.287 --> 05:08.521
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late
- It must be awfully important.

05:08.610 --> 05:12.287
Like a party or something.
Mr Rabbit! Wait!

05:12.372 --> 05:15.093
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm overdue

05:15.174 --> 05:19.568
I'm really in a stew No time to say
goodbye, Hello I'm late, I'm late, I'm late

05:19.657 --> 05:23.334
My. What a peculiar place
to have a party.

05:25.061 --> 05:27.701
You know, Dinah,
we really shouldn't...

05:27.782 --> 05:29.615
um- be doing this.

05:30.865 --> 05:35.066
After all,
we haven't been invited,

05:36.348 --> 05:38.945
and curiosity often
leads to trouble.

05:39.031 --> 05:40.909
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

05:43.754 --> 05:47.306
Goodbye, Dinah.
Goodbye!

05:50.758 --> 05:53.070
Oh.

05:53.161 --> 05:56.393
Well, after this, I shall
think nothing of fall-

05:56.482 --> 05:58.634
Oh. Of falling down stairs.

06:25.023 --> 06:26.855
Oh!

06:28.505 --> 06:30.338
Ahh.

06:32.188 --> 06:34.419
Whoa!

06:34.509 --> 06:37.549
Goodness. What if I
should fall right through...

06:37.632 --> 06:40.067
the centre of the earth-

06:40.153 --> 06:42.988
Oh! And come out
the other side...

06:43.075 --> 06:45.192
where people walk
upside down?

06:45.276 --> 06:49.034
Oh, but that's silly.
Nobody- Oh!

06:53.683 --> 06:56.245
Oh, Mr Rabbit! Wait!

06:56.325 --> 06:59.285
Please!

07:13.976 --> 07:16.652
Curiouser and curiouser!

07:19.581 --> 07:23.623
- Ohh!
- Oh! Oh, I beg your pardon.

07:23.704 --> 07:27.585
Whew. Ha. It's quite all right,
but you did give me quite a turn.

07:27.667 --> 07:31.183
- You see, I was following-
- Rather good, what? Doorknob? Turn?

07:31.269 --> 07:33.660
- Please, sir.
- Swell, huh?

07:33.751 --> 07:37.747
One good turn deserves another.
What can I do for you?

07:37.834 --> 07:41.306
Well, I'm looking for a white rabbit,
so, um, if you don't mind-

07:41.396 --> 07:43.194
Eh? Oh!

07:43.277 --> 07:47.432
- There he is! I simply must get through.
- Sorry. You're much too big.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.592
- Simple impassable.
- You mean impossible.

07:49.682 --> 07:52.596
No, impassable.
Nothing's impossible.

07:53.525 --> 07:57.885
- Why don't you try the bottle on the table?
- Table? Oh!

07:57.968 --> 08:02.088
Read the directions and directly you'll
be directed in the right direction.

08:02.171 --> 08:04.083
"Drink me. "

08:04.172 --> 08:08.134
Hmm. Better look first,
for if one drinks much...

08:08.215 --> 08:10.411
from a bottle
marked "poison,"

08:10.496 --> 08:14.572
it's almost certain to disagree
with one sooner or later.

08:14.659 --> 08:18.337
- Beg your pardon?
- I was just giving myself some good advice.

08:18.422 --> 08:21.302
But- Mmm.

08:21.384 --> 08:23.854
Tastes like, uh,
cherry tart.

08:25.187 --> 08:28.977
Custard, pineapple,
roast turkey. Goodness!

08:30.350 --> 08:32.388
- What did I do?
- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

08:32.472 --> 08:34.828
You almost went out
like a candle.

08:34.913 --> 08:37.793
But look!
I'm just the right size.

08:37.875 --> 08:39.947
Oh, no use.

08:40.037 --> 08:41.948
I forgot to tell you.

08:42.038 --> 08:43.871
I'm locked!

08:43.960 --> 08:46.156
Oh, no!

08:46.241 --> 08:48.837
Uh, but of course, uh,
you've got the key, so-

08:48.923 --> 08:52.680
- What key?
- Now don't tell me you've left it up there.

08:53.726 --> 08:55.559
Oh, dear.

09:01.612 --> 09:05.733
- Whatever will I do?
- Try the box, naturally.

09:05.815 --> 09:07.886
Oh!

09:07.976 --> 09:11.733
"Eat me. " All right,
but goodness knows what this will do.

09:11.819 --> 09:15.177
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, oh!

09:17.103 --> 09:19.220
What did you say?

09:19.304 --> 09:22.298
I said, "A little of that
went a long way. "

09:23.347 --> 09:25.544
Well, I don't think
it's so funny.

09:25.629 --> 09:28.543
Now- Now I shall
n- never get home!

09:28.631 --> 09:32.069
Oh, come, come, now.
Crying won't help.

09:32.153 --> 09:34.350
I know, but I-I-

09:34.435 --> 09:36.792
I just can't-
I can't stop!

09:36.877 --> 09:39.996
Come! Oh! Say,
this won't do.

09:44.282 --> 09:47.754
It won't do at all.

09:47.844 --> 09:50.235
You! You up there!
Stop!

09:50.326 --> 09:52.158
I say! Oh, look!

09:52.247 --> 09:54.717
The bottle. The bottle!

10:05.216 --> 10:08.416
Oh, dear. I do wish
I hadn't cried so much.

10:14.824 --> 10:18.022
Oh, a sailor's life
is the life for me

10:18.105 --> 10:20.382
How I love to sail
on the bounding sea

10:20.467 --> 10:22.459
And I never, never, ever
do a thing about the weather

10:22.548 --> 10:24.985
For the weather never, ever
does a thing for me

10:25.070 --> 10:28.348
Oh, a sailor's life
is the life for me

10:28.432 --> 10:30.665
Tiddlee um pom pom
Deedle dum dum dee

10:30.754 --> 10:32.746
And I never, ev-
Ahoy!

10:32.836 --> 10:36.626
And other nautical expressions!
Land ho, by Jove!

10:36.718 --> 10:38.756
- Where away, Dodo?
- Dodo?

10:38.840 --> 10:41.640
Three points to starboard.
Pull away, me hearties.

10:41.722 --> 10:44.397
Have you in port
in no time at all.

10:44.484 --> 10:47.796
- Oh, yo-ho-ho and a bottle of sea
- Uh, Mr Dodo! Please!

10:47.887 --> 10:50.801
- We'll all fish fry as we sail the sea
- Please help me!

10:53.890 --> 10:56.487
Um, uh, uh, pardon me,
but, uh,

10:56.573 --> 11:00.250
would you mind
helping me, please?

11:00.335 --> 11:03.090
Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo!

11:03.177 --> 11:06.137
Help me. Please!
Won't you-

11:09.021 --> 11:12.618
Help me!

11:12.703 --> 11:15.663
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Come and join the chase

11:15.745 --> 11:18.580
Nothing could be drier
than a jolly caucus race

11:18.668 --> 11:21.582
Backward, forward, outward, inward
bottom to the top

11:21.670 --> 11:24.823
Never a beginning
There can never be a stop

11:24.912 --> 11:27.747
Hopping, skipping, hopping, skipping
Fancy-free and gay

11:27.834 --> 11:30.634
That's all they did tomorrow
but you finished yesterday

11:30.716 --> 11:33.994
Round and round and round
we go until forevermore

11:34.078 --> 11:36.878
Once we were behind
but now we find we are be-

11:36.960 --> 11:39.920
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Come and join the chase

11:40.002 --> 11:42.962
Nothing could be drier
than a jolly caucus race

11:43.044 --> 11:46.562
Ah, backward-
I say! You'll never get dry that way.

11:46.648 --> 11:49.209
- Get dry?
- Have to run with the others.

11:49.289 --> 11:51.406
First rule of
a caucus race, you know.

11:51.490 --> 11:54.290
But how can I-

11:54.372 --> 11:57.492
That's better. Have you
dry in no time now.

11:57.575 --> 11:59.931
No one can ever
get dry this way.

12:00.016 --> 12:03.489
Nonsense! Why, I'm
as dry as a bone already.

12:03.579 --> 12:06.459
- Yes, but-
- All right, chaps. Let's have it now.

12:06.541 --> 12:09.421
Look lively.

12:09.503 --> 12:13.260
The White Rabbit.
Mr Rabbit. M-Mr Rabbit-

12:13.346 --> 12:15.861
- Oh, my goodness! I'm late. I'm late.
- Oh-oh, don't go away.

12:15.947 --> 12:17.780
- I'll be right back.
- I'm late, I'm late.

12:17.869 --> 12:20.304
- I'm late, I'm late. - Don't step
on the fish! Uh, w-w-watch it there.

12:20.391 --> 12:23.385
Stop kicking that mackerel.
Brilliant!Jolly well-

12:26.155 --> 12:28.829
Mr Rabbit.
Oh, Mr Rabbit.

12:28.916 --> 12:32.468
Oh, dear, I'm sure
he came this way.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.756
Do you suppose
he could be hiding?

12:35.921 --> 12:37.993
Hmm.

12:38.083 --> 12:40.553
Not here.

12:40.645 --> 12:42.477
I wonder.

12:51.493 --> 12:53.405
No, I suppose
he must've-

12:53.494 --> 12:57.285
Oh! Why, what peculiar
little figures.

12:58.618 --> 13:02.215
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.

13:02.300 --> 13:05.100
If you think we're waxworks,
you ought to pay, you know.

13:05.182 --> 13:08.495
Contrary to wax, if you think
we're alive, you ought to speak to us.

13:15.029 --> 13:18.865
- That's logic.
- Well, it's been nice meeting you.

13:18.951 --> 13:20.784
Goodbye.

13:20.873 --> 13:22.705
You're beginning backwards.

13:22.795 --> 13:25.185
Aye, the first thing
in a visit is to say:

13:25.276 --> 13:28.395
How do you do and shake hands
Shake hands, shake hands

13:28.478 --> 13:32.394
How do you do and shake hands
and state your name and business

13:32.481 --> 13:35.281
- That's manners.
- Really?

13:35.363 --> 13:38.323
Well, my name is Alice, and I'm
following a white rabbit, so-

13:38.405 --> 13:41.922
- No, you can't go yet.
- No, the visit has just started.

13:42.007 --> 13:45.719
- I'm very sorry.
- Would you like to play hide-and-seek?

13:45.811 --> 13:48.565
- Or "Button, button, who's got the button"?
- No, thank you.

13:48.653 --> 13:51.122
If you stay long enough,
we might have a battle.

13:52.375 --> 13:55.927
That's very kind of you,
but I must be going.

13:56.018 --> 13:58.533
- Why?
- Because I'm following a white rabbit.

13:58.619 --> 14:02.170
- Why? - Well, I-I'm curious
to know where he's going.

14:02.262 --> 14:04.414
Oh, she's curious.

14:05.825 --> 14:08.545
The oysters were curious,
too, weren't they?

14:08.626 --> 14:11.426
Aye, and you remember
what happened to them.

14:12.989 --> 14:15.346
- Poor things.
- Poor things.

14:15.431 --> 14:17.708
Why? What did happen
to the oysters?

14:17.792 --> 14:20.263
- Oh, you wouldn't be interested.
- Oh, but I am.

14:20.355 --> 14:23.155
No, no, you're in
much too much of a hurry.

14:23.237 --> 14:26.469
- Well, perhaps I could spare a little time.
- You could?

14:26.558 --> 14:27.958
Well!

14:29.121 --> 14:31.636
"The Walrus
and the Carpenter. "

14:31.723 --> 14:35.320
Or "The Story of
the Curious Oysters. "

14:40.048 --> 14:43.725
The sun was shining on the sea
Shining with all its might

14:43.810 --> 14:47.931
He did his very best to make
the billows smooth and bright

14:48.013 --> 14:50.689
And this was odd
because it was

14:50.776 --> 14:53.007
The middle of the night

15:00.743 --> 15:02.621
The walrus
and the carpenter

15:02.704 --> 15:04.742
Were walking close at hand

15:04.826 --> 15:06.657
The beach was wide
from side to side

15:06.746 --> 15:08.659
But much too full of sand

15:08.748 --> 15:11.024
Mr Walrus
said the carpenter

15:11.110 --> 15:13.067
My brain begins to perk

15:13.151 --> 15:15.382
We'll sweep this clear
in half a year

15:15.473 --> 15:17.305
If you don't mind the work

15:17.394 --> 15:19.864
Work!

15:19.956 --> 15:22.425
- Th-The time has come
- The walrus said

15:22.517 --> 15:26.275
To talk of other things.:
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax

15:26.361 --> 15:28.192
And cabbages and kings

15:28.281 --> 15:32.358
And why the sea is boiling hot
and whether pigs have wings

15:32.445 --> 15:35.837
Calloo, callay
No work today

15:35.927 --> 15:39.080
We're cabbages and kings

16:09.551 --> 16:12.670
Oh, uh, oysters, come out
and walk with us.

16:12.752 --> 16:15.064
The day is warm and bright.

16:15.155 --> 16:17.545
A pleasant walk,
a pleasant talk,

16:17.636 --> 16:20.072
would be a sheer delight.

16:20.158 --> 16:22.913
Yes, and should we
get hungry on the way,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.277
we'll stop and, uh,
have a bite.

16:28.324 --> 16:30.840
But Mother Oyster
winked her eye

16:30.926 --> 16:33.077
And shook her heavy head

16:33.167 --> 16:35.728
She knew too well
this was no time

16:35.809 --> 16:38.371
To leave her oyster bed

16:38.451 --> 16:41.489
The sea is nice
Take my advice

16:41.573 --> 16:44.453
- And stay right here
- Mum said

16:44.535 --> 16:47.768
Yes, yes, of course, of course,
but, uh, ha-ha!

16:47.857 --> 16:49.690
The time has come
my little friends

16:49.779 --> 16:52.055
To talk of other things

16:52.140 --> 16:55.897
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax
of cabbages and kings

16:55.983 --> 17:00.377
And why the sea is boiling hot
and, uh, whether pigs have wings

17:01.747 --> 17:04.627
Calloo, callay
Come run away

17:04.709 --> 17:07.430
With cabbages and kings

17:45.418 --> 17:48.651
Well, now, uh,
let me see.

17:51.542 --> 17:54.297
Ah! A loaf of bread
is what we chiefly need.

17:58.747 --> 18:01.582
Listen, how 'bout some pepper
and salt and vinegar, eh?

18:01.669 --> 18:05.266
Well, yes, yes. Splendid idea.
Ha-ha. Very good indeed.

18:06.832 --> 18:09.302
Now, if you're ready,

18:09.394 --> 18:11.227
oysters, dear,

18:12.596 --> 18:15.032
we can begin the feed.

18:15.118 --> 18:17.714
- Feed?
- Oh, yes. Uh-

18:17.800 --> 18:21.239
The time has come my little friends
to talk of food and things

18:21.323 --> 18:24.681
Of peppercorns and mustard seed
and other seasonings

18:24.765 --> 18:27.918
We'll mix 'em all together
in a sauce that's fit for kings

18:28.007 --> 18:30.728
Calloo, callay
We'll eat today

18:30.809 --> 18:35.363
Like cabbages and kings

18:38.615 --> 18:41.495
I, uh- I-I weep for you.

18:41.577 --> 18:45.812
I- Oh, excuse me.
I deeply sympathize.

18:45.900 --> 18:48.131
For I've enjoyed
your company...

18:48.221 --> 18:51.694
oh, much more
than you realize.

18:51.784 --> 18:54.698
Little oysters.
Little oysters.

18:54.786 --> 18:57.507
But answer there came none

18:57.588 --> 19:00.502
And this was scarcely
odd because

19:00.590 --> 19:04.187
They'd been eaten, every one

19:05.714 --> 19:08.354
Well, uh-

19:10.077 --> 19:11.989
The time has come!

19:20.724 --> 19:23.001
With cabbages

19:23.086 --> 19:26.525
And kings

19:26.609 --> 19:29.444
- The end.
- That was a very sad story.

19:29.531 --> 19:31.727
Aye, and there's
a moral to it.

19:31.812 --> 19:34.931
Oh, yes, a very good moral,
if you happen to be an oyster.

19:35.014 --> 19:37.928
- Well, it's been a very nice visit-
- Another recitation.

19:38.017 --> 19:39.973
- I'm sorry, but-
- Entitled "Father William. "

19:40.057 --> 19:41.890
- But really, I'm-
- First verse.

19:41.979 --> 19:44.335
You are old, Father William
the young man said

19:44.420 --> 19:46.538
And your hair
has become very white

19:46.623 --> 19:48.579
And yet you incessantly
stand on your head

19:48.663 --> 19:50.656
Do you think at your age
it is right, it's right

19:50.745 --> 19:52.941
Do you think at your age
it is right

19:53.026 --> 19:57.068
Well, in me youth
Father William replied to his son

19:57.149 --> 19:59.142
I'd do it again
and again and again

19:59.231 --> 20:01.382
And I've done it again
and again and again

20:06.476 --> 20:08.433
I wonder who lives here.

20:09.958 --> 20:13.510
Mary Ann! Oh, drat that girl.
Where could she have put them?

20:13.601 --> 20:15.514
- Mary Ann!
- The rabbit!

20:15.602 --> 20:18.165
Mary Ann!

20:18.245 --> 20:21.045
No use! Can't wait! I'm awfully late.
Oh, me. Oh, my. Oh, me. Oh, my.

20:21.127 --> 20:23.323
Excuse me, sir, but-
but I've been trying to-

20:23.408 --> 20:25.764
Why, Mary Ann!
What are you doing out here?

20:25.849 --> 20:28.969
- Mary Ann?
- Don't just do something. Stand there. No, no! Go, go!

20:29.052 --> 20:31.567
- Go get my gloves. I'm late!
- But late for what?

20:31.653 --> 20:34.215
- That's just what I-
- My gloves!

20:34.295 --> 20:36.447
- At once! Do you hear?
- Goodness.

20:36.537 --> 20:39.737
I suppose I'll be taking
orders from Dinah next.

20:39.820 --> 20:42.130
Hmm. Now let me see.

20:43.542 --> 20:47.584
If I were a rabbit, where
would I keep my gloves?

20:47.665 --> 20:49.817
Oh! Thank you.

20:49.907 --> 20:52.376
Don't mind if I do.

20:57.112 --> 20:58.943
Oh, no, no, not again.

21:00.514 --> 21:02.631
Oh! Mary Ann!

21:05.277 --> 21:08.874
Now you see here,
Mary Ann. Help!

21:13.683 --> 21:15.959
I need help!
Whoo-hoo! Ha! Oh!

21:16.044 --> 21:18.321
No! Help!

21:18.406 --> 21:21.367
Monster! Help! Assistance!

21:25.971 --> 21:28.488
- Oh, dear.
- A monster! A monster, Dodo!

21:28.574 --> 21:31.772
- In my house, Dodo. Oh, my poor
little-bitty house. - The dodo.

21:31.855 --> 21:34.655
Steady. Steady, old chap. Can't
be as bad as all that, you know.

21:34.737 --> 21:39.177
Oh, my poor roof and rafters.
All my walls and- There it is!

21:39.261 --> 21:42.733
By Jove!
Jolly well is, isn't it?

21:42.824 --> 21:44.860
Well, do something, Doo-doo.

21:44.944 --> 21:47.859
Yes, indeed. An extraordinary
situation, but, uh-

21:47.947 --> 21:51.021
But, but, but, but, but what?

21:51.109 --> 21:53.579
But I have a very
simple solution.

21:53.671 --> 21:56.266
- Thank goodness.
- W-W-W-What is it?

21:56.352 --> 21:59.506
- Simply pull it out the chimney.
- Yes, g-g-go on, go on. Pull it out.

21:59.595 --> 22:02.316
Who, me?
Don't be ridiculous.

22:02.397 --> 22:04.469
What we need is a- Uh-

22:06.600 --> 22:10.198
- A lizard with a ladder!
- Hmm? Oh! Bill!

22:10.283 --> 22:14.119
Bill! We need a lazard with
a lidder- A lidder- A b-b-b-

22:14.205 --> 22:16.641
- Can you help us?
- At your service, governor.

22:16.727 --> 22:19.402
Bill, me lad, have you
ever been down a chimney?

22:19.489 --> 22:22.050
Why, governor, I've been
down more chimneys-

22:22.130 --> 22:25.648
Excellent, excellent.
You just pop down the chimney...

22:25.733 --> 22:27.612
and haul that monster
out of there.

22:27.695 --> 22:30.005
Righto, governor.
Monster?

22:38.142 --> 22:40.612
Steady now. There.
That's better.

22:40.703 --> 22:44.381
Bill, lad, you're passing up
a golden opportunity.

22:44.466 --> 22:46.537
- I am?
- You can be famous.

22:46.627 --> 22:48.665
- I can?
- Of course!

22:48.749 --> 22:51.549
There's a brave lad.
In you go now.

22:51.631 --> 22:54.147
Nothing to it, old boy.
Simply tie your tail...

22:54.233 --> 22:57.147
around the monster's neck
and drag it out.

22:57.235 --> 23:00.355
- B-But-But, governor-
- Good luck, Bill.

23:12.485 --> 23:15.844
Well, there goes Bill.

23:17.049 --> 23:19.246
- Poor Bill.
- Uh,

23:19.331 --> 23:23.042
perhaps we should try
a- a more energetic remedy.

23:23.133 --> 23:25.091
Yes! Anything, anything.
But hurry!

23:25.175 --> 23:28.931
Oh, I-I propose
that we, uh-

23:29.018 --> 23:32.092
- Yes, go on, go on. Yes, yes.
- I propose we, uh-

23:32.180 --> 23:34.011
Oh!

23:34.101 --> 23:37.140
By Jove! That's it.
We'll burn the house down.

23:37.223 --> 23:39.579
Yes. Burn the house- What?

23:39.664 --> 23:41.782
- Oh, no.
- Oh-ho-ho!

23:41.866 --> 23:44.177
Oh, we'll smoke
the blighter out

23:44.268 --> 23:46.146
We'll put the beast to rout

23:46.230 --> 23:48.062
Some kindling
A stick or two

23:48.151 --> 23:51.384
Ah, this bit of rubbish
ought to do

23:51.473 --> 23:54.273
- Oh, dear
- We'll smoke the blighter out

23:54.355 --> 23:58.556
- We'll smoke the monster out
- No, no! Not my beautiful bird house!

23:58.638 --> 24:01.916
Oh, we'll roast
the blighter's toes

24:02.001 --> 24:03.833
We'll toast
the bounder's nose

24:03.922 --> 24:06.039
Just fetch that gate
We'll make it clear

24:06.123 --> 24:09.003
- That monsters aren't welcome here
- Oh, dear. Oh, me, oh, my.

24:09.085 --> 24:11.647
- A match? Thank you.
- Match?

24:11.727 --> 24:16.121
Without a single doubt
we'll smoke the monster out

24:16.210 --> 24:18.601
We'll smoke the monster out
No! No!

24:18.692 --> 24:20.570
My poor house
and furniture.

24:20.654 --> 24:23.249
Oh, dear.
This is serious.

24:23.335 --> 24:25.976
I simply must- Ah!
A garden.

24:26.057 --> 24:30.930
Perhaps if I ate something,
it would make me grow smaller.

24:31.021 --> 24:32.978
Let go! Help!

24:33.062 --> 24:36.694
- I'm sorry, but I must eat something.
- Not me! You, you, you, you-

24:36.785 --> 24:40.336
You barbarian!
Help!

24:41.308 --> 24:43.904
Monster!

24:43.990 --> 24:45.982
Help!

24:46.071 --> 24:49.145
Ah! I'm late! Oh, dear.
I'm here. I should be there.

24:49.233 --> 24:51.590
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.
- I say, do you have a match?

24:51.675 --> 24:54.828
Oh, no. Must go. Goodbye.
Hello. I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.

24:54.917 --> 24:57.479
- Wait! Please wait!
- Ah, young lady.

24:57.559 --> 25:00.200
- Do you have a match?
- No, I-I'm sorry, but-

25:00.281 --> 25:03.593
- Mr Rabbit!
- No cooperation. No cooperation at all.

25:03.683 --> 25:05.834
Well, can't have
monsters about.

25:05.925 --> 25:08.122
Jolly well have to
carry on alone.

25:12.969 --> 25:15.930
Wait! Please!
Just a minute!

25:16.653 --> 25:20.807
Oh, dear. I'll never catch him
while I'm this small.

25:20.895 --> 25:24.095
Why, what curious
butterflies.

25:24.178 --> 25:26.295
You mean
bread-and-butterflies.

25:26.379 --> 25:28.292
Oh, yes,
of course, uh- Hmm?

25:29.942 --> 25:31.774
Now who do you suppose-

25:37.147 --> 25:41.063
A horsefly! I mean,
a- a rocking horsefly.

25:41.150 --> 25:43.985
- Naturally.
- I beg your pardon,

25:44.072 --> 25:46.189
but, uh, did you-

25:46.273 --> 25:49.905
Oh, that's nonsense.
Flowers can't talk.

25:49.996 --> 25:52.192
But of course
we can talk, my dear.

25:52.277 --> 25:54.554
If there's anyone
worth talking to.

25:54.639 --> 25:56.631
Or about.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.838
- And we sing too.
- You do?

25:58.922 --> 26:01.563
Oh, yes. Would you like to hear
"Tell It to the Tulips"?

26:01.644 --> 26:05.161
- No, let's sing about us.
- We know one about the shy little violets.

26:05.246 --> 26:08.446
- Oh, no, not that old thing.
- Let's do "Lovely Lily of the Valley. "

26:08.529 --> 26:10.839
- How 'bout a daisy duet? - Oh, she
wouldn't like that. - Oh, watch the rose.

26:10.930 --> 26:15.610
Girls! We shall sing
"Golden Afternoon. "

26:15.694 --> 26:18.163
That's about all of us.

26:18.255 --> 26:20.373
Sound your "A," Lily.

26:20.458 --> 26:22.734
La

26:22.819 --> 26:24.492
Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi
mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi

26:24.580 --> 26:26.094
La, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la

26:26.181 --> 26:27.854
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

26:27.942 --> 26:29.695
Dum du dum-dum

26:37.509 --> 26:41.425
Little bread-and-butterflies
kiss the tulips

26:41.512 --> 26:45.223
And the sun is like
a toy balloon

26:45.314 --> 26:49.105
There are
Get-up-in-the-morning glories

26:49.198 --> 26:53.113
In the golden afternoon

26:53.200 --> 26:56.911
There are dizzy daffodils
on the hillside

26:57.002 --> 27:00.793
Strings of violets
are all in tune

27:00.885 --> 27:04.881
Tiger lilies
love the dandelions

27:04.969 --> 27:07.564
In the golden afternoon

27:07.650 --> 27:10.485
The gold afternoon

27:10.572 --> 27:12.609
There are
dog- and cat-erpillars

27:12.693 --> 27:14.606
And a copper centipede

27:14.695 --> 27:17.211
Where the lazy daisies

27:17.297 --> 27:19.766
Love the very

27:19.858 --> 27:23.331
Peaceful life

27:23.421 --> 27:28.863
They lead

27:28.945 --> 27:32.701
You can learn a lot
of things from the flowers

27:32.787 --> 27:35.622
For especially
in the month ofJune

27:35.709 --> 27:37.542
Ah, ah, ah, ah
There's a wealth

27:37.631 --> 27:41.467
Of happiness
and romance

27:41.554 --> 27:44.946
All in the golden

27:45.036 --> 27:47.506
Afternoon

28:07.372 --> 28:09.649
All in the golden afternoon

28:09.733 --> 28:15.733
The golden afternoon

28:15.817 --> 28:21.214
You can learn a lot
of things from the flowers

28:21.301 --> 28:26.425
For especially
in the month ofJune

28:26.505 --> 28:28.736
There's a wealth
of happiness

28:28.826 --> 28:31.980
And romance

28:32.069 --> 28:34.379
All-

28:34.470 --> 28:39.070
The golden afternoon

28:41.315 --> 28:47.919
Ah

28:52.564 --> 28:55.125
- Oh, that was lovely!
- Thank you, my dear.

28:55.205 --> 28:57.801
What kind of garden
do you come from?

28:57.887 --> 28:59.401
Oh, I don't come
from any garden.

28:59.488 --> 29:01.639
Do you suppose
she's a wild flower?

29:01.729 --> 29:04.609
Oh, no.
I'm not a wild flower.

29:04.691 --> 29:08.483
Just what specie- or shall we
say genus- are you, my dear?

29:08.575 --> 29:10.406
Well, I suppose
you'd call me...

29:10.496 --> 29:13.649
a Genus Humanus Alice.

29:13.738 --> 29:16.048
Ever see an Alice with
a blossom like that?

29:16.139 --> 29:18.655
Come to think of it,
did you ever see an Alice?

29:18.741 --> 29:22.976
Yes. And did you
notice her petals?

29:23.064 --> 29:25.341
What a peculiar colour.

29:25.426 --> 29:27.737
And no fragrance.

29:27.828 --> 29:29.785
Just look at those stems.

29:29.870 --> 29:31.701
Rather scrawny, I'd say.

29:31.790 --> 29:33.544
I think she's pretty.

29:33.632 --> 29:35.864
- Quiet, bud.
- But I'm not a flower.

29:35.953 --> 29:38.264
Aha!Just as I suspected.

29:38.355 --> 29:42.476
She's nothing but a common
Mobile Vulgaris.

29:42.558 --> 29:44.515
Oh, no!

29:44.599 --> 29:47.162
- A common what?
- To put it bluntly:

29:47.242 --> 29:50.236
- A weed.
- I'm not a weed.

29:50.323 --> 29:53.602
- Well, you wouldn't expect her to admit it.
- Can you imagine?

29:53.686 --> 29:56.646
- Well, goodness!
- Don't let her stay here and go to seed.

29:56.728 --> 29:59.084
- Go on now. Don't you take root-
- Please, girls!

29:59.169 --> 30:01.640
We don't want weeds
in our bed.

30:01.732 --> 30:04.201
Move along, move along.

30:09.056 --> 30:12.016
All right, if that's
the way you feel about it.

30:12.098 --> 30:16.061
If I were my right size, I could pick
every one of you if I wanted to.

30:16.141 --> 30:18.452
And I guess
that would teach you.

30:24.548 --> 30:27.462
You can learn a lot
of things from the flowers.

30:27.550 --> 30:31.101
Hm! Seems to me they could learn
a few things about manners.

30:35.555 --> 30:37.990
A

30:38.077 --> 30:41.515
E- I-O-U

30:42.600 --> 30:46.073
A- E-I-O-U

30:47.243 --> 30:50.556
A- E-I-O-U

30:53.248 --> 30:55.717
Who

30:55.809 --> 31:00.124
U- E-I-O-A

31:00.212 --> 31:05.209
U- E-I-A

31:05.296 --> 31:10.693
A- E-I-O-U

31:18.024 --> 31:22.225
Who are you?

31:22.307 --> 31:24.983
Well, I-I-I
hardly know, sir.

31:25.070 --> 31:27.825
I've changed so many times
since this morning, you see-

31:27.912 --> 31:30.382
I do not see.

31:30.474 --> 31:32.113
Explain yourself.

31:32.195 --> 31:34.791
I'm afraid I can't
explain myself, sir,

31:34.877 --> 31:37.187
because I'm not myself,
you know.

31:37.278 --> 31:39.111
I do not know.

31:39.200 --> 31:43.161
Well, I can't put it any more clearly,
for it isn't clear to me.

31:43.242 --> 31:47.204
You? Who are you?

31:47.285 --> 31:49.926
Well, don't you think
you ought to tell me...

31:52.408 --> 31:55.767
who you are first?

31:55.851 --> 31:58.572
Why?

31:58.653 --> 32:01.692
Oh, dear, everything
is so confusing.

32:01.775 --> 32:04.416
- It is not.
- Well, it is to me.

32:04.497 --> 32:08.333
- Why? - Well, I can't remember
things as I used to, and-

32:08.420 --> 32:10.936
- Recite.
- Hmm?

32:11.022 --> 32:14.334
Oh. Oh, oh, yes, sir. Um-

32:14.424 --> 32:17.304
How doth the little
busy bee improve each shin-

32:17.386 --> 32:19.948
Stop.

32:20.028 --> 32:22.020
That is not spoken
correct-ically.

32:22.110 --> 32:23.942
It goes:

32:25.872 --> 32:27.704
How-

32:36.400 --> 32:38.596
How doth
the little crocodile...

32:38.681 --> 32:40.992
improve his shining tail...

32:41.083 --> 32:43.154
and pour the waters
of the Nile...

32:43.244 --> 32:46.124
on every golden scale?

32:47.167 --> 32:49.319
How cheer-

32:49.409 --> 32:52.528
How cheer-

32:58.135 --> 33:00.604
How cheerfully
he seems to grin.

33:00.696 --> 33:02.768
How neatly
spreads his claws...

33:03.979 --> 33:06.289
and welcomes
little fishes in...

33:06.380 --> 33:10.456
with gently smiling jaws.

33:10.543 --> 33:13.184
Well, I must say I've never
heard it that way before.

33:13.265 --> 33:16.065
I know.
I have improved it.

33:16.147 --> 33:19.540
Well- If you ask me-

33:19.630 --> 33:21.701
You? Heh!

33:21.791 --> 33:24.182
Who are you?

33:31.278 --> 33:33.110
Oh!

33:40.404 --> 33:43.284
Uh, you there. Girl!

33:43.366 --> 33:45.882
Wait! Come back!

33:45.968 --> 33:48.005
I have something
important to say.

33:49.050 --> 33:51.645
Oh, dear.

33:51.732 --> 33:53.849
I wonder what
he wants now.

34:05.942 --> 34:08.411
Well?

34:08.504 --> 34:10.655
Keep your temper.

34:12.266 --> 34:14.498
- Is that all?
- No.

34:16.589 --> 34:20.346
Exact-ically what
is your problem?

34:20.431 --> 34:23.107
Well, it's exact-ically-
exact-ical-

34:23.194 --> 34:25.471
Well, it's precisely this:

34:25.556 --> 34:27.866
I should like to be
a little larger, sir.

34:27.956 --> 34:30.837
- Why?
- Well, after all,

34:30.918 --> 34:33.196
three inches is such
a wretched height-

34:33.281 --> 34:36.002
I am exact-ically
three inches high!

34:36.083 --> 34:38.724
And it is a very good
height indeed!

34:40.846 --> 34:44.364
But I'm not used to it,
and you needn't...

34:44.449 --> 34:46.281
shout!

34:48.170 --> 34:52.531
- Oh, dear.
- By the way, I have a few more helpful hints.

34:52.614 --> 34:54.766
One side will make you
grow taller.

34:54.857 --> 34:59.330
- One side of what?
- And the other side will make you grow shorter.

34:59.419 --> 35:02.538
- The other side of what?
- The mushroom, of course!

35:06.784 --> 35:07.501
Hmm.

35:12.108 --> 35:15.068
One side will
make me grow-

35:15.150 --> 35:17.108
But which is which?

35:18.272 --> 35:21.551
Hmm. After all
that's happened, I-

35:21.635 --> 35:24.150
I wonder if I-
I don't care.

35:26.398 --> 35:28.868
I'm tired of being
only three inches high.

35:28.960 --> 35:32.238
Yi, yi, yi, yi, yi,
yi, yi, yi, yi, yi!

35:41.288 --> 35:44.009
A serpent! Help!

35:44.090 --> 35:46.242
Help! Serpent! Serpent!

35:46.332 --> 35:48.164
Oh, but please, please!

35:48.253 --> 35:52.044
Off with you! Shoo! Shoo!
Go away! Serpent! Serpent!

35:52.136 --> 35:55.733
- But I'm not a serpent.
- Ser- Indeed?

35:55.819 --> 35:59.052
- Then just what are you?
- I'm just a little girl.

35:59.141 --> 36:01.372
Little? Ha! Little?

36:02.983 --> 36:06.058
Well, I am.
I mean, I-I was.

36:06.146 --> 36:09.505
And I suppose you
don't eat eggs either.

36:09.588 --> 36:12.980
- Yes, I do, but, but, but-
- Ah! I knew it! I knew it.

36:13.071 --> 36:16.429
Serpent. Serpent!

36:16.513 --> 36:18.073
Oh, for goodness' sake.

36:19.155 --> 36:21.990
Hmm! And the
other side will-

36:22.077 --> 36:23.750
The very idea.

36:23.839 --> 36:26.991
Spend all my time laying eggs
for serpents like her.

36:36.447 --> 36:40.237
Goodness. I wonder if I'll
ever get the knack of it.

36:47.815 --> 36:49.808
There. That's much better.

36:51.017 --> 36:53.328
Hmm. Better save these.

36:57.501 --> 37:00.222
Now let's see.
Where was I?

37:02.945 --> 37:06.304
Hmm. I- I wonder
which way I ought to go.

37:06.388 --> 37:09.587
'Twas brillig

37:09.670 --> 37:11.502
And the slithy toves

37:11.591 --> 37:15.508
Did gyre and gimble
in the wabe

37:15.595 --> 37:19.556
All mimsy
were the borogroves

37:19.637 --> 37:23.997
And the mome raths
outgrabe

37:24.081 --> 37:26.915
Now where in the world
do you suppose that-

37:27.003 --> 37:29.154
- Lose something?
- Oh!

37:29.244 --> 37:32.238
Oh, uh- I-
I was- N-No.

37:32.326 --> 37:34.443
I- I-I mean, I-I was
just wondering-

37:34.527 --> 37:37.680
Oh, that's quite all right.
Uh, one moment, please.

37:39.131 --> 37:40.963
Ooh.

37:42.413 --> 37:43.289
Second chorus.

37:43.413 --> 37:45.849
'Twas brillig

37:45.935 --> 37:47.893
And the slithy toves

37:47.977 --> 37:52.690
Did gyre and gimble
in the wabe

37:52.781 --> 37:55.137
Why- Why, you're a cat.

37:55.222 --> 37:59.137
A Cheshire cat.
All mimsy

37:59.225 --> 38:01.217
Were the borogroves

38:01.306 --> 38:04.381
Oh, wait!
Don't go, please.

38:04.469 --> 38:06.586
There you are.
Third chorus.

38:06.670 --> 38:08.549
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you, but-

38:08.632 --> 38:11.067
But I just wanted to ask you
which way I ought to go.

38:11.153 --> 38:13.715
Well, that depends...

38:13.795 --> 38:16.789
on where you want
to get to.

38:16.877 --> 38:19.187
Oh, it really doesn't matter,
as long as I-

38:19.278 --> 38:22.193
Then it really
doesn't matter...

38:22.281 --> 38:24.558
which way you go.

38:28.686 --> 38:32.157
And the mome raths outgrabe

38:34.410 --> 38:37.050
Oh, by the way.

38:37.131 --> 38:39.522
If you'd really
like to know,

38:39.613 --> 38:42.003
he went that way.

38:43.096 --> 38:45.087
- Who did?
- The White Rabbit.

38:45.177 --> 38:47.374
- He did?
- He did what?

38:47.459 --> 38:49.052
- Went that way.
- Who did?

38:49.139 --> 38:51.336
- The White Rabbit.
- What rabbit?

38:51.421 --> 38:55.258
But didn't you just say-
I mean- Oh, dear.

38:55.344 --> 38:57.462
Can you stand
on your head?

38:57.546 --> 39:00.664
- Oh!
- However,

39:00.747 --> 39:04.790
if I were looking
for a white rabbit,

39:04.870 --> 39:07.340
I'd ask the Mad Hatter.

39:07.433 --> 39:10.904
The Mad Hatter? Um,
no, no, I-I don't think-

39:10.995 --> 39:14.034
Or there's the March Hare...

39:14.117 --> 39:16.235
in that direction.

39:16.319 --> 39:19.074
Uh, thank you. I-I think
I shall visit him.

39:19.161 --> 39:22.199
Of course,
he's mad too.

39:22.282 --> 39:24.879
Oh, but I don't want
to go among mad people.

39:24.965 --> 39:27.527
Oh, you can't help that.

39:27.607 --> 39:29.678
Most everyone's mad here.

39:33.971 --> 39:36.645
You may have noticed...

39:36.732 --> 39:40.775
that I'm not
all there myself.

39:44.178 --> 39:47.776
And the mome raths
outgrabe

39:48.461 --> 39:51.421
Goodness. If the people
here are like that, I-

39:51.503 --> 39:53.496
I must try
not to upset them.

39:55.946 --> 39:58.337
How very curious.

39:58.428 --> 40:01.706
If there are no objections
let it be unanimous

40:01.790 --> 40:05.307
- Oh, a very merry unbirthday
- A very merry unbirthday

40:05.392 --> 40:08.306
A very merry
unbirthday to us

40:25.647 --> 40:29.005
A very merry
unbirthday to me

40:29.089 --> 40:30.569
- To who - To
me - Oh, you

40:30.651 --> 40:32.290
A very merry
unbirthday to you

40:32.372 --> 40:33.964
- Who, me -
Yes, you - Oh, me

40:34.052 --> 40:36.966
Let's all congratulate us
with another cup of tea

40:37.055 --> 40:40.094
A very merry unbirthday

40:40.177 --> 40:43.455
To

40:43.540 --> 40:45.372
You

40:48.462 --> 40:50.614
- No room, no room, no room.
- No vacancy.

40:50.705 --> 40:54.416
- No room, no room, no room!
- But I thought there was plenty of room.

40:54.507 --> 40:56.704
Ah, but it's very rude to
sit down without being invited.

40:56.789 --> 41:01.229
I'll say it's rude.
It's very, very rude indeed.

41:01.311 --> 41:03.953
Very, very,
very rude indeed.

41:04.034 --> 41:05.866
Oh, I'm very sorry,

41:05.955 --> 41:08.550
but I did enjoy your singing,
and I wondered if you could tell me-

41:08.637 --> 41:10.515
You enjoyed our singing?

41:10.598 --> 41:12.955
Oh, what a delightful child.

41:14.521 --> 41:17.161
Things happen. I'm so excited!
We never get compliments.

41:17.243 --> 41:20.521
- You must have a cup of tea.
- Ah, yes, indeed, the tea.

41:20.605 --> 41:23.565
- You must have a cup of tea.
- That would be very nice.

41:23.647 --> 41:25.879
I'm sorry I interrupted
your birthday party.

41:25.969 --> 41:28.531
- Uh-uh, thank you.
- Birthday? Ha-ha-ha.

41:28.610 --> 41:31.002
My dear child, this is not
a birthday party.

41:31.093 --> 41:32.924
Of course not.

41:33.975 --> 41:36.285
This is an unbirthday party.

41:36.376 --> 41:40.531
Unbirthday? Oh, I'm sorry,
but I don't quite understand.

41:40.619 --> 41:42.975
It's very simple.
Now, 30 days hath Sept-

41:43.061 --> 41:46.294
No. Well. An unbirthday-

41:46.383 --> 41:48.819
If you have a birthday,
then, you-

41:50.786 --> 41:53.666
- She doesn't know what an unbirthday is.
- How silly!

41:54.989 --> 41:56.947
Well, I-

41:59.833 --> 42:02.109
I shall elucidate.

42:08.078 --> 42:11.756
Now statistics prove
prove that you've one birthday

42:11.841 --> 42:14.198
Imagine.:just one
birthday every year

42:14.283 --> 42:19.155
Ah, but there are
364 unbirthdays

42:19.246 --> 42:21.523
Precisely why we're
gathered here to cheer

42:21.608 --> 42:24.124
Why, then, today is
my unbirthday too.

42:24.210 --> 42:27.443
- It is?
- What a small world this is.

42:27.532 --> 42:29.968
In that case-

42:30.054 --> 42:33.252
- A very merry unbirthday
- To me

42:33.336 --> 42:35.932
- To you
- A very merry unbirthday

42:36.018 --> 42:37.930
- For me
- For you

42:38.019 --> 42:42.061
Now blow the candle out, my dear
and make your wish come true

42:45.344 --> 42:48.896
A very merry unbirthday

42:48.987 --> 42:50.979
To you

42:52.670 --> 42:55.823
Twinkle, twinkle,
little bat,

42:55.912 --> 42:58.382
How I wonder
what you're at.

42:58.474 --> 43:01.274
Up above the world
you fly...

43:01.356 --> 43:04.827
Like a tea-tray
in the sky.

43:04.918 --> 43:08.675
- Oh, that was lovely.
- And, uh, and now, my dear,

43:08.761 --> 43:11.960
uh, you were saying that
you would like to seek-

43:12.043 --> 43:14.513
Pardon me.

43:14.605 --> 43:17.599
Uh, you were seeking, uh, some
information of some kind?

43:17.687 --> 43:19.679
Oh, yes. You see,
I'm looking for a-

43:19.768 --> 43:23.002
Clean cup, clean cup.
Move down!

43:23.091 --> 43:25.162
- But I haven't used my cup.
- Drink up, drink up

43:25.252 --> 43:28.371
Move down, move down
Drink up, drink up, move down

43:28.454 --> 43:30.447
Would you like
a little more tea?

43:30.536 --> 43:34.053
Well, I haven't had any yet,
so I can't very well take more.

43:34.138 --> 43:36.973
Ah, you mean you can't
very well take less.

43:37.060 --> 43:40.533
Yes. You can always
take more than nothing.

43:40.623 --> 43:44.140
- But I only meant that-
- And now, my dear,

43:44.225 --> 43:46.695
something, uh, seems
to be troubling you.

43:47.868 --> 43:49.825
Uh, won't you tell us
all about it?

43:49.909 --> 43:53.029
- Start at the beginning.
- Yes, yes.

43:53.112 --> 43:55.707
And when you come
to the end,

43:55.794 --> 43:57.626
stop, see?

43:57.715 --> 43:59.547
Well, it all started...

43:59.636 --> 44:02.027
while I was sitting on
the riverbank with Dinah.

44:02.118 --> 44:04.793
Very interesting.

44:04.880 --> 44:08.477
- Who's Dinah?
- Why, Dinah's my cat. You see-

44:08.562 --> 44:10.998
Ah! Cat?

44:16.888 --> 44:20.486
- Get the jam. On his nose. Put it on his nose.
- On his nose, on his nose.

44:20.571 --> 44:24.327
- C-C-Cat.
- Oh. Oh.

44:24.413 --> 44:28.329
My goodness. Those are
the things that upset me.

44:28.416 --> 44:30.249
See all the trouble
you've started?

44:30.338 --> 44:32.569
- But really, I didn't think that-
- Ah, but that's the point.

44:32.659 --> 44:35.256
- If you don't think, you shouldn't talk.
- Clean cup, clean cup.

44:35.341 --> 44:37.811
Move down, move down, move down!

44:37.903 --> 44:39.735
- But I still haven't used-
- Move down, move down, move down

44:39.824 --> 44:41.703
Move down

44:41.786 --> 44:44.985
And now, my dear,
as you were saying?

44:45.068 --> 44:48.540
Oh, yes. I was sitting
on the riverbank with, uh,

44:48.630 --> 44:50.463
with you-know-who.

44:50.552 --> 44:52.510
I do?

44:52.593 --> 44:56.635
I mean my c-a-t.

44:56.716 --> 44:58.753
Tea?

44:58.837 --> 45:00.830
Just half a cup,
if you don't mind.

45:02.440 --> 45:05.435
Come, come, my dear.
Don't you care for tea?

45:05.522 --> 45:07.879
Why, yes, I'm very
fond of tea, but-

45:07.964 --> 45:11.595
If you don't care for tea, you could
at least make polite conversation.

45:11.686 --> 45:14.078
Well, I've been trying
to ask you-

45:14.168 --> 45:16.046
I have an excellent idea.

45:16.130 --> 45:18.201
Let's change the subject.

45:19.972 --> 45:23.011
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?

45:23.094 --> 45:25.291
Riddles?

45:25.376 --> 45:27.208
Let me see now.

45:27.297 --> 45:31.260
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?

45:31.341 --> 45:34.779
- I beg your pardon?
- Why is a raven like a writing desk?

45:34.863 --> 45:38.778
- Why is a what?
- Careful. She's stark, ravin' mad.

45:38.865 --> 45:41.904
But, but it's your silly riddle.
You just said-

45:41.988 --> 45:44.948
- Steady. Don't get excited.
- How about a nice cup of tea?

45:45.030 --> 45:49.105
Have a cup of tea, indeed. Well,
I'm sorry, but I just haven't the time.

45:49.273 --> 45:52.073
The time! The time!
Who's got the time?

45:52.155 --> 45:54.193
No, no, no, no. No time,
no time, no time.

45:54.277 --> 45:56.667
Hello. Goodbye.
I'm late. I'm late.

45:56.758 --> 45:58.954
- The White Rabbit!
- Oh, I'm so late.

45:59.039 --> 46:00.952
I'm so very, very late.

46:01.041 --> 46:05.675
Well, no wonder you're late. Why,
this clock is exactly two days slow.

46:05.765 --> 46:07.642
- Two days slow?
- Course you're late.

46:08.886 --> 46:10.958
My goodness.

46:11.048 --> 46:14.201
We'll have to look
into this. Aha!

46:14.291 --> 46:16.122
I see what's
wrong with this.

46:16.211 --> 46:18.648
Why, this watch
is full of wheels.

46:18.734 --> 46:22.969
Oh, my poor watch.
Oh, my wheels and springs.

46:23.057 --> 46:25.367
- But, but, but, but, but, but,
but, but- - Butter! Of course!

46:25.458 --> 46:28.258
It needs some butter.
Butter!

46:28.340 --> 46:31.140
- Butter!
- But-but-butter?

46:31.222 --> 46:34.102
Butter. Oh, thank you.
Butter. Yes, that's fine.

46:34.184 --> 46:36.700
Oh, no, no! No, no, no!
You'll get crumbs in it.

46:36.786 --> 46:39.825
Oh, this is the very best butter.
What are you talking about?

46:39.908 --> 46:42.788
- Tea?
- Tea! Oh, I never thought of tea! Of course.

46:42.870 --> 46:44.862
- Don't! Don't! Not tea!
- Tea.

46:44.951 --> 46:47.786
- Sugar?
- Sugar? Two spoons. Yes, y- Two spoons.

46:47.873 --> 46:50.469
- Thank you, yes.
- Oh, please be careful!

46:50.555 --> 46:52.513
- Jam?
- Jam! I forgot all about the jam.

46:52.597 --> 46:54.714
- No! Not jam!
- Just shows you what a person'll do.

46:54.798 --> 46:57.554
- Mustard?
- Mustard, yes! Mus-

46:57.640 --> 47:01.921
Mustard?
Don't let's be silly.

47:02.003 --> 47:04.917
Lemon- that's different.
That's- There.

47:05.005 --> 47:06.838
That should do it.

47:09.408 --> 47:11.480
- Look at that. - It's
going mad. - Oh, my goodness.

47:11.570 --> 47:14.132
- Oh, dear. - It's going mad.
Mad watch. - Oh, my goodness.

47:14.212 --> 47:16.045
- I can't understand it. It was the best butter.
- Mad watch. Mad watch.

47:16.134 --> 47:19.252
- Mad watch! - Oh, look. Do you
think the springs- Oh, my goodness!

47:19.335 --> 47:21.852
There's only one way
to stop a mad watch.

47:25.460 --> 47:27.418
Two days slow.
That's what it is.

47:27.502 --> 47:30.621
- Oh, my watch.
- It was?

47:30.703 --> 47:33.094
And it was an
unbirthday present too.

47:33.186 --> 47:36.737
- Well, in that case.
- A very merry unbirthday

47:36.828 --> 47:39.742
To

47:39.830 --> 47:42.425
- You
- Mr Rabbit.

47:42.512 --> 47:45.347
Oh, Mr Rabbit! Oh,
now where did he go to?

47:45.434 --> 47:52.028
A very merry unbirthday
to us, to us

47:52.119 --> 47:54.156
- If there are no objections let it be unanimous
- Of all the silly nonsense.

47:54.240 --> 47:58.794
This is the stupidest tea party
I've ever been to in all my life.

48:03.287 --> 48:05.243
Well, I've had
enough nonsense.

48:05.327 --> 48:08.720
I'm going home.
Straight home.

48:10.011 --> 48:14.964
That rabbit. Who cares
where he's going anyway?

48:15.055 --> 48:17.651
Why, if it hadn't
been for him, I-

48:17.737 --> 48:19.888
"Tulgey Wood. "

48:21.138 --> 48:23.290
Hmm. Curious.

48:23.381 --> 48:25.213
I don't remember this.

48:28.824 --> 48:30.737
Now let me see.

48:34.588 --> 48:37.104
Oh!

48:38.230 --> 48:41.748
Mmm, no, no, please.
No more nonsense.

48:46.357 --> 48:50.034
Now, if I came this way,

48:50.119 --> 48:53.079
I should go back this way.

48:53.161 --> 48:55.040
Oh, I-I beg your pardon.

49:13.936 --> 49:17.692
My goodness. When I get home,
I shall write a book about this place.

49:18.779 --> 49:21.853
If I- If I ever
do get home.

49:33.349 --> 49:36.149
Oh, uh, excuse me.

49:36.231 --> 49:38.269
Um, could one of you
tell me-

49:44.717 --> 49:46.869
Uh- Heh-heh. Never mind.

49:52.803 --> 49:56.081
Oh, dear. It's getting
dreadfully dark.

49:56.165 --> 49:57.997
And nothing
looks familiar.

50:08.773 --> 50:12.132
I shall certainly be glad
to get out of- Oh!

50:26.706 --> 50:33.547
Who. Who-who.

50:33.631 --> 50:35.464
Who.

50:35.553 --> 50:38.831
It would be so nice if something
would make sense for a change.

50:46.040 --> 50:48.191
Oh!

50:50.483 --> 50:55.002
"Don't step on
the mome raths. "

50:55.086 --> 50:57.966
The mome raths?

51:05.974 --> 51:09.685
A path!
Oh, thank goodness.

51:09.776 --> 51:13.897
Ah. I just knew I'd
find one sooner or later.

51:13.979 --> 51:17.372
If I hurry fast, I might even
be home in time for tea.

51:17.462 --> 51:20.535
Oh. Oh, won't Dinah
be happy to see me.

51:22.705 --> 51:25.346
Oh, I just can't wait
till I- Ah!

51:40.398 --> 51:43.198
Oh, dear. Now I-

51:43.280 --> 51:45.237
Now I shall never get out.

51:47.243 --> 51:50.282
Well, when-
when one's lost,

51:50.365 --> 51:54.246
I- I suppose
it's good advice...

51:54.328 --> 51:58.722
to stay where you are
until someone finds you.

51:58.811 --> 52:01.725
But- But who'd ever think
to look for me here?

52:04.775 --> 52:07.575
Good advice.

52:07.657 --> 52:11.539
If, If, If, If I'd listened
earlier, I-I wouldn't be here.

52:11.620 --> 52:14.694
But- But that's just
the trouble with me.

52:14.782 --> 52:17.821
I give myself
very good advice.

52:19.305 --> 52:22.777
But I very seldom
follow it

52:24.989 --> 52:27.106
That explains

52:27.190 --> 52:30.868
The trouble that
I'm always in

52:33.555 --> 52:35.467
Be patient

52:35.556 --> 52:38.197
Is very good advice

52:38.278 --> 52:42.911
But the waiting
makes me curious

52:43.001 --> 52:46.201
And I'd love the change

52:46.284 --> 52:49.005
Should something strange

52:49.086 --> 52:50.918
Begin

52:53.209 --> 52:56.920
Well, I went along
my merry way.

52:58.452 --> 53:02.368
And I never stopped
to reason.

53:04.216 --> 53:06.732
I should have known

53:06.819 --> 53:09.459
There'd be a price to pay

53:09.540 --> 53:14.942
Someday

53:15.024 --> 53:18.063
I give myself

53:18.146 --> 53:20.867
Very good advice

53:20.948 --> 53:23.908
But I very seldom
follow it

53:26.792 --> 53:29.388
Will I ever learn

53:29.474 --> 53:32.708
To do the things

53:32.796 --> 53:34.628
I should

53:36.239 --> 53:40.838
Will I ever learn

53:42.724 --> 53:46.925
Learn to do the things

53:47.007 --> 53:50.364
I should

53:56.813 --> 54:01.128
And the mome raths
outgrabe

54:01.216 --> 54:03.048
Oh, Cheshire Cat!
It's you!

54:03.137 --> 54:06.974
Whom did you expect?
The White Rabbit perchance?

54:07.061 --> 54:11.056
Oh, no, no, no.
I- I-I'm through with rabbits.

54:11.143 --> 54:13.818
I wanna go home!

54:13.905 --> 54:16.421
- But I can't find my way.
- Naturally.

54:16.507 --> 54:19.022
That's because
you have no way.

54:19.108 --> 54:24.392
All ways here, you see,
are the Queen's way.

54:24.472 --> 54:27.865
- But I've never met any Queen.
- You haven't?

54:27.955 --> 54:32.075
You haven't?
Oh, but you must!

54:32.158 --> 54:36.039
She'll be mad about you.
Simply mad.

54:36.120 --> 54:37.953
And the mome raths
outgrabe

54:38.042 --> 54:41.400
Please, please! Uh,
how can I find her?

54:41.485 --> 54:44.284
Well, some go this way.

54:44.367 --> 54:46.437
Some go that way.

54:46.528 --> 54:49.089
But as for me, myself,
personally,

54:49.169 --> 54:51.640
I prefer the short cut.

55:08.623 --> 55:10.455
Painting the roses red

55:10.544 --> 55:12.377
We're painting
the roses red

55:12.466 --> 55:14.298
We dare not stop
or waste a drop

55:14.387 --> 55:16.219
So let the paint be spread

55:16.308 --> 55:21.108
We're painting
the roses red

55:22.633 --> 55:25.752
Oh, painting
the roses red

55:25.835 --> 55:27.667
And many a tear we shed

55:27.756 --> 55:30.556
- Because we know
- They'll cease to grow

55:30.638 --> 55:33.280
In fact
they'll soon be dead

55:33.361 --> 55:36.638
Ohh, and yet
we go ahead

55:36.723 --> 55:41.242
Painting the roses red, red
red, red, red, red, red, red

55:41.326 --> 55:44.878
Painting the roses red
We're painting the roses red

55:44.968 --> 55:48.850
Oh, pardon me, but, Mr Three
why must you paint them red

55:48.932 --> 55:51.731
Huh? Oh!

55:51.814 --> 55:53.931
Well, the fact is, miss,

55:54.015 --> 55:58.534
we planted the white roses
by mistake, and-

55:58.618 --> 56:02.011
The Queen she likes them red
If she saw white instead

56:02.101 --> 56:03.932
- She'd raise a fuss
- And each of us

56:04.022 --> 56:06.583
- Would quickly lose his head
- Goodness!

56:06.663 --> 56:10.818
Since this is
the thought we dread

56:10.906 --> 56:14.026
- We're painting the roses red
- Oh, dear.

56:14.109 --> 56:15.941
Then let me help you.

56:16.030 --> 56:19.627
- Painting the roses red
- We're painting the roses red

56:19.712 --> 56:21.545
Don't tell the Queen
what you have seen

56:21.634 --> 56:24.993
Or say that's what we said but
we're painting the roses red

56:25.077 --> 56:27.273
Yes, painting
the roses red

56:27.358 --> 56:29.316
- Not pink - Not
green - Not aquamarine

56:29.400 --> 56:32.518
We're painting
the roses red

56:38.606 --> 56:40.724
- The Queen!
- The Queen!

56:40.808 --> 56:42.639
- Queen!
- The Queen!

57:39.409 --> 57:41.241
Cards, halt!

57:42.730 --> 57:43.527
Sound off!

57:43.852 --> 57:44.728
One, two, three,

57:44.812 --> 57:46.645
four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, jack!

57:50.576 --> 57:52.409
The rabbit.

57:54.378 --> 57:59.297
H- H-Her Imperial Highness,
Her, Her Grace,

57:59.382 --> 58:04.744
Her Excellency, Her Royal
Majesty, the Queen of Hearts!

58:07.428 --> 58:09.625
- And the King.
- Hooray!

58:20.236 --> 58:25.155
Hmm! Who's been
painting my roses red?

58:25.240 --> 58:28.872
Who's been painting
my roses red?

58:28.963 --> 58:31.479
Who dares to paint
with vulgar paint

58:31.565 --> 58:33.875
The Royal flower bed

58:33.967 --> 58:37.041
For painting my roses red

58:37.129 --> 58:39.246
Someone will lose his head

58:39.330 --> 58:42.005
Oh, no, Your Majesty, please!
It's all his fault!

58:42.092 --> 58:44.561
Not me, Your Grace!
The ace! The ace!

58:44.654 --> 58:47.011
- You? The deuce, you say?
- No! Two!

58:47.096 --> 58:49.737
- Not me! The trey!
- That's enough!

58:49.818 --> 58:51.889
Off with their heads!

58:55.101 --> 58:58.301
They're going to lose their heads
For painting the roses red

58:58.384 --> 59:01.264
It serves them right, they planted white
The roses should be red

59:01.346 --> 59:03.907
Oh, they're going to
lose their heads

59:03.987 --> 59:07.187
Silence!

59:07.270 --> 59:09.341
Oh, please, please.
They were only trying-

59:09.431 --> 59:13.586
- And who is this?
- Uh, well. Well, well, now, uh, uh, let me see, my dear.

59:13.674 --> 59:16.793
It certainly isn't a heart.
Uh, do you suppose it's a club?

59:16.876 --> 59:20.110
Why, it's a little girl.

59:20.199 --> 59:23.193
- Yes. A-And I was hoping-
- Look up. Speak nicely.

59:23.281 --> 59:25.922
And don't twiddle
your fingers!

59:26.003 --> 59:28.678
Turn out your toes. Curtsy.

59:28.765 --> 59:33.046
Open your mouth a little wider.
And always say:

59:33.128 --> 59:36.964
"Yes, Your Majesty. "

59:37.051 --> 59:40.363
"Yes, Your Majesty. "

59:41.854 --> 59:46.135
Now, um, where do you come from,
and where are you going?

59:46.217 --> 59:48.334
W- Well, I-I'm trying
to find my way home.

59:48.418 --> 59:52.893
Your way? All ways
here are my ways!

59:52.982 --> 59:55.703
Well, yes, I-I know.
But I was just thinking-

59:55.784 --> 59:59.665
Curtsy while you're thinking.
It saves time.

59:59.746 --> 01:00:02.023
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.
But I was only going to ask-

01:00:02.107 --> 01:00:03.747
I'll ask the questions!

01:00:03.909 --> 01:00:06.709
Do you play croquet?

01:00:06.791 --> 01:00:11.026
- Why, yes, Your Majesty.
- Then let the game begin!

01:00:13.716 --> 01:00:16.186
To your places. To your places. By order
of the King. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

01:00:17.519 --> 01:00:19.351
Shuffle deck!

01:00:20.361 --> 01:00:24.642
Card cut! Deal cards!

01:00:24.724 --> 01:00:27.445
Cards, halt!

01:00:57.827 --> 01:00:59.978
Silence!

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:02.388
Off with his head!

01:02:02.472 --> 01:02:05.864
Off with his head. Off with his head. By
order of the King. Uh, you heard what she said.

01:02:05.954 --> 01:02:09.472
- You're next, my dear.
- Oh, but-

01:02:10.918 --> 01:02:13.149
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.

01:02:33.534 --> 01:02:35.605
Oh!

01:02:38.137 --> 01:02:41.290
- Stop!
- Oh, of all the impossible-

01:02:41.379 --> 01:02:43.211
Do you want us both
to lose our heads?

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:46.055
- Uh-huh.
- Well, I don't.

01:03:18.365 --> 01:03:21.359
Uh, I say, how are
you getting on?

01:03:21.447 --> 01:03:23.564
- Not at all.
- Beg pardon?

01:03:23.648 --> 01:03:25.481
I said, not at all!

01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:27.846
Who are you talking to?

01:03:27.931 --> 01:03:31.210
- Oh, uh, a cat, Your Majesty.
- Cat? Where?

01:03:31.294 --> 01:03:34.129
There. Oh.

01:03:34.216 --> 01:03:37.130
- Oh, there he is again!
- I warn you, child,

01:03:37.218 --> 01:03:40.098
if I lose my temper,
you lose your head!

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:43.095
Understand?

01:03:43.183 --> 01:03:47.701
You know, we could make her
really angry. Shall we try?

01:03:47.785 --> 01:03:50.302
- Oh, no, no!
- Oh, but it's loads of fun.

01:03:50.388 --> 01:03:52.778
No, no, no! Stop!

01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:56.103
Oh, no!

01:03:56.192 --> 01:03:58.184
Oh, my fur and whiskers!

01:03:58.273 --> 01:04:00.505
Oh, dear! Save the Queen.

01:04:00.595 --> 01:04:03.064
Someone's head
will roll for this!

01:04:05.077 --> 01:04:07.388
Yours!

01:04:07.479 --> 01:04:10.279
- Off with her-
- But, but, but, but consider, my dear.

01:04:10.362 --> 01:04:14.277
Uh, couldn't she have
a trial? Huh? First?

01:04:14.364 --> 01:04:19.726
- Trial?
- Well, th-Just a, a little trial? Hmm?

01:04:19.808 --> 01:04:23.166
Hmm. Very well, then.

01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:26.041
Let the trial begin!

01:04:34.298 --> 01:04:38.453
Your Majesty.
Members of the jury.

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:41.660
Loyal subjects.

01:04:41.743 --> 01:04:44.053
And the King.

01:04:44.145 --> 01:04:48.106
The prisoner at the bar is charged with
enticing Her Majesty, the Queen of Hearts,

01:04:48.187 --> 01:04:50.784
into a game of croquet
and thereby willfully...

01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:53.670
- But- - and with malice
aforethought, teasing, tormenting...

01:04:53.752 --> 01:04:56.507
- and otherwise annoying our beloved-
- Never mind all that!

01:04:56.594 --> 01:04:59.394
Get to the part where
I lose my temper.

01:05:00.956 --> 01:05:02.789
Thereby causing the Queen
to lose her temper.

01:05:02.878 --> 01:05:07.910
Now, are you ready
for your sentence?

01:05:08.002 --> 01:05:10.723
Sentence? Oh, but there
must be a verdict first.

01:05:10.804 --> 01:05:14.002
Sentence first!
Verdict afterwards.

01:05:14.085 --> 01:05:17.239
- But that just isn't the way!
- All ways are-

01:05:17.328 --> 01:05:19.638
Your ways, Your Majesty.

01:05:19.729 --> 01:05:23.281
Uh, yes, my child.
Off with her-

01:05:23.372 --> 01:05:25.763
- But consider, my dear. Eh, we've called no witnesses.
- Huh?

01:05:25.854 --> 01:05:28.973
Uh, couldn't we hear maybe
one or two? Huh? Maybe?

01:05:29.056 --> 01:05:33.098
Oh, very well.
But get on with it!

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:36.811
- First witness. First witness. Herald, call the first witness.
- The March Hare.

01:05:41.865 --> 01:05:44.825
Uh, oh, oh, what do you know
about this, uh, unfortunate affair?

01:05:44.907 --> 01:05:46.978
- Nothing.
- Nothing whatever?

01:05:47.068 --> 01:05:51.190
- Nothing whatever!
- That's very important!

01:05:51.271 --> 01:05:53.628
Jury, write that down.

01:05:56.355 --> 01:05:59.315
Uh, unimportant, uh,
Your Majesty means of course.

01:05:59.398 --> 01:06:02.312
Silence! Next witness.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.231
The Dormouse.

01:06:09.044 --> 01:06:11.002
- Well-
- Shh!

01:06:11.086 --> 01:06:13.442
What have you to
say about this?

01:06:13.527 --> 01:06:17.808
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat.
How I wonder-

01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:21.772
That's the most important piece
of evidence we've heard yet.

01:06:21.853 --> 01:06:24.210
Write that down!

01:06:24.294 --> 01:06:26.936
- Twinkle, twinkle. Twinkle, twinkle.
- Twinkle, twinkle.

01:06:27.017 --> 01:06:29.977
Twinkle, twinkle.
What next?

01:06:30.058 --> 01:06:31.937
The Mad Hatter.

01:06:36.784 --> 01:06:40.175
- Off with your hat!
- Oh, my!

01:06:40.265 --> 01:06:43.100
And, uh, where were you when
this horrible crime was committed?

01:06:43.188 --> 01:06:45.305
I was home drinking tea.

01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:47.905
Today, you know,
is my unbirthday.

01:06:47.991 --> 01:06:51.225
Why, my dear, today is
your unbirthday too.

01:06:51.314 --> 01:06:53.351
- It is?
- It is?

01:06:53.435 --> 01:06:55.267
It is?

01:06:55.357 --> 01:06:58.431
- A very merry unbirthday
- To me?

01:06:58.519 --> 01:07:01.194
- Oh, no!
- To you! A very merry unbirthday

01:07:01.281 --> 01:07:03.112
- For me?
- For you!

01:07:03.201 --> 01:07:06.753
Now blow the candle out, my dear,
and make your wish come true.

01:07:09.727 --> 01:07:13.119
A very merry unbirthday

01:07:13.208 --> 01:07:16.328
To you

01:07:16.411 --> 01:07:18.563
Oh! Your Majesty.

01:07:18.653 --> 01:07:21.294
Uh, yes, my dear?

01:07:21.375 --> 01:07:23.206
Look! There he is now!

01:07:23.295 --> 01:07:26.256
- Huh? Wha- Who?
- The Cheshire Cat.

01:07:26.338 --> 01:07:28.170
- Cat!
- Cat?

01:07:28.259 --> 01:07:30.138
- Cat! Cat, cat, cat, cat!
- There he goes! There he goes!

01:07:30.221 --> 01:07:33.294
- Oh, this is terrible! Help! Help!
- Stop him! Stop him!

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:36.058
- Stop him. Catch him.
- Somebody help me. Catch him.

01:07:36.144 --> 01:07:39.742
- Get me the jam. The jam, quick.
- The jam! The jam! By order of the King.

01:07:39.827 --> 01:07:42.902
The jam. Let me have it!

01:07:46.352 --> 01:07:51.874
Somebody's head is
going to roll for this!

01:07:51.955 --> 01:07:55.634
- Aha!
- The mushroom.

01:07:55.719 --> 01:07:58.359
Off with her h-

01:08:02.763 --> 01:08:05.233
Oh, pooh. I'm not
afraid of you.

01:08:06.365 --> 01:08:09.007
Why, you're nothing
but a pack of cards.

01:08:09.088 --> 01:08:13.130
Rule 42: "All persons
more than a mile high...

01:08:13.211 --> 01:08:15.168
must leave the court
immediately. "

01:08:15.252 --> 01:08:18.212
I am not a mile high.
And I'm not leaving.

01:08:19.254 --> 01:08:21.406
Sorry. Rule 42, you know.

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:26.176
And as for you,
Your Majesty-

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:28.216
Your Majesty indeed.

01:08:28.301 --> 01:08:30.770
Why, you're not a queen.
You're just a,

01:08:30.863 --> 01:08:35.861
a fat, pompous, bad-tempered,
old ty- tyrant.

01:08:38.108 --> 01:08:42.627
And, uh, what were you
saying, my dear?

01:08:42.711 --> 01:08:46.912
Well, she simply said that you're a fat,
pompous, bad-tempered, old tyrant.

01:08:46.993 --> 01:08:49.305
Off with her head!

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.236
You heard what
Her Majesty said.

01:08:57.322 --> 01:08:59.154
Off with her head.

01:09:21.899 --> 01:09:24.288
Forward, backward, inward, outward
Here we go again

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.850
No one ever loses and
no one can ever win

01:09:26.942 --> 01:09:29.457
Backward, forward, outward, inward
bottom to the top

01:09:29.544 --> 01:09:31.341
- Never let the-
- Off with her head!

01:09:31.425 --> 01:09:33.622
Off with her head!

01:09:33.707 --> 01:09:37.224
Just a moment! You can't leave a tea party
without having a cup of tea, you know.

01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:39.904
- But I can't stop now.
- Ah, but we insist.

01:09:39.991 --> 01:09:42.666
You must join us
in a cup of tea.

01:09:46.156 --> 01:09:48.991
Off with her head!

01:09:49.078 --> 01:09:51.639
Mr Caterpillar,
what will I do?

01:09:51.719 --> 01:09:53.598
Who are you?

01:09:56.203 --> 01:09:59.322
There she goes.
Don't let her get away!

01:09:59.405 --> 01:10:01.556
Off with her head!

01:10:06.129 --> 01:10:09.249
Oh! Still locked, you know.

01:10:09.332 --> 01:10:12.087
But the Queen!
I simply must get out!

01:10:12.174 --> 01:10:14.849
- But you are outside.
- What?

01:10:14.936 --> 01:10:16.689
See for yourself.

01:10:16.777 --> 01:10:18.928
Why- Why, that's me!

01:10:19.018 --> 01:10:22.252
- I'm asleep.
- Don't let her get away!

01:10:22.341 --> 01:10:26.576
- Off with her head!
- Alice, wake up. Please wake up, Alice!

01:10:26.664 --> 01:10:30.102
- Alice! Please wake up, Alice!
- Off with her head!

01:10:30.186 --> 01:10:32.941
Alice! Alice. Alice.

01:10:33.028 --> 01:10:35.339
Alice. Alice.

01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:38.505
Will you kindly pay attention
and recite your lesson?

01:10:38.593 --> 01:10:43.430
Hmm? Oh. Oh! Uh, how doth the little
crocodile improve his shining tail?

01:10:43.516 --> 01:10:48.070
- And pour the waters of the-
- Alice, what are you talking about?

01:10:48.159 --> 01:10:51.676
Oh. I'm sorry. But you see,
the caterpillar said-

01:10:51.761 --> 01:10:55.359
Caterpillar?
Oh, for goodness' sake.

01:10:55.444 --> 01:10:59.918
Alice, I- Oh, well.
Come along. It's time for tea.

01:11:00.008 --> 01:11:05.165
Alice in Wonderland

01:11:05.251 --> 01:11:11.046
Over the hill
Or here or there

01:11:11.135 --> 01:11:16.771
I wonder where

01:11:28.547 --> 01:11:33.499
Alice in Wonderland

01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:37.473
How do you get
to Wonderland

01:11:37.553 --> 01:11:41.469
Over the hill
Or under land

01:11:41.556 --> 01:11:46.031
Orjust behind the tree

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:51.072
Alice in Wonderland

01:11:51.163 --> 01:11:56.036
Where is the path
to Wonderland

01:11:56.127 --> 01:12:01.602
Over the hill
Or here or there

01:12:01.691 --> 01:12:06.289
I wonder where
