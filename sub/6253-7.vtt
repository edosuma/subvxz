No, Daddy, I can’t.
Don’t make me.

00:06.716 --> 00:09.378
Sweetie, there’s no monster
in the toilet.

00:09.468 --> 00:11.845
I promise you, princess.
Okay?

00:12.847 --> 00:14.838
| poop by myself.

00:14.932 --> 00:18.299
And mommy poops
by herself. Right?

00:18.394 --> 00:21.511
You can too. Look at you.
You are a big girl now.

00:21.606 --> 00:23.062
But I’m scared.

00:23.149 --> 00:25.310
That’s okay, sweetie.
It’s okay.

00:25.401 --> 00:27.107
We’re all soared sometimes.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.777
But that’s why you get to have
as much ice cream as you want.

00:31.199 --> 00:33.235
And... a cat.

00:34.285 --> 00:36.276
Okay? Okay.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.326
Go ahead, sweetie.

00:38.414 --> 00:41.326
Daddy’s gonna stay
right here, princess.

00:43.377 --> 00:46.619
That’s a good girl.
Good, brave girl.

00:46.714 --> 00:50.047
Everything’s gonna be
just fine. I promise.

00:50.134 --> 00:53.126
I want a brown cat

[ Screams ]

- [Screaming Continues]

[ Both Screaming ]

01:10.655 --> 01:13.192
You’ll receive
excellent care
at St. George’s.

01:13.282 --> 01:16.490
Our maternity facilities
are number one
in all categories.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.568
Including the incidence
of staph infection.

01:18.663 --> 01:21.780
No, this is
a great hospital, okay?
They got great doctors.

01:21.874 --> 01:24.957
Plus, they have the best
lactation specialist
in the world.

01:25.044 --> 01:27.535
She’s so good, I bet
she could teach me
how to lactate.

01:27.630 --> 01:31.498
You’ve made your preference
for our baby being born in
a Catholic hospital very clear.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.548
Catholic has nothing
to do with it, okay?

01:33.636 --> 01:35.422
It’s an outstanding
hospital, all right?

01:35.513 --> 01:37.549
I want a home birth
where I can control things.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.631
It’s a lot safer
in the hospital, Bones.
Come on.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.716
No, on the contrary,
hospitals are breeding
grounds...

01:41.811 --> 01:43.597
for antibiotic-resistant
super germs...

01:43.688 --> 01:46.725
leading to a high incidence
of E. coli and staphylococcus
infection.

01:46.857 --> 01:49.940
I’m sorry. Is that true?
No,no.No.

- Brennan.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.076
Oh, Cam just found
an eyeball in a toilet.

02:08.212 --> 02:10.203
[ Booth ] Oh.
I didn’t check the toilets.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.414
Let’s get out of here.

02:12.508 --> 02:14.920
Great tour.
Great hospital.

02:15.011 --> 02:16.501
We’ll be in touch,
all right?

02:16.595 --> 02:19.052
I’ll get that lactation
specialist’s number
from ya, all right?

02:19.181 --> 02:21.558
Don’t need that.
Right. We’re gonna—
This is a great spot.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.805
There are no signs of anyone
being killed or dismembered
in the house.

02:24.895 --> 02:27.272
Which means the remains
must have come up
through the pipe.

02:27.356 --> 02:30.314
Wow! Okay, the rest
of the body’s probably
blocking the lines.

02:30.401 --> 02:33.484
This kid is gonna
have some serious issues
with toilet training, huh?

02:33.571 --> 02:40.238
Okay, I have a sphenoid
and what looks like several
fragments of the maxilla.

02:40.328 --> 02:43.695
You’re good.
I’m still trying to get
ahold of this eyeball.

02:43.789 --> 02:46.246
Hey, how did the, uh,
hospital tour go? May I?

02:46.334 --> 02:50.043
Booth liked it.
But he seems very
comfortable around germs.

02:50.129 --> 02:51.710
Yeah. Boys are like that.

02:51.797 --> 02:54.880
It was a great hospital—
shiny machines,
masks all over the place.

02:58.554 --> 03:01.762
I’ll need more bones
if we’re gonna learn
anything about this victim.

03:01.849 --> 03:05.137
Oh, local cops say roots
clogged up the sewer lines,

03:05.227 --> 03:07.639
and stuff is backing up
all over the neighborhood.

03:07.730 --> 03:10.642
Question is, how did the vic
wind up in so many pieces?

03:10.733 --> 03:14.351
The deceased could have
become trapped in the sewer
and then decomposed.

03:14.445 --> 03:16.857
Which I have never seen,
but I’d certainly like to.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.814
- I could write a paper
and— and cite you.
- It’s okay, Bones.

03:19.909 --> 03:22.241
Maybe the victim was flushed
down more than one toilet.

03:22.328 --> 03:24.193
Another
fascinating prospect.

03:24.288 --> 03:25.903
Okay. Sorry I asked.

03:25.998 --> 03:28.330
Animals could have eaten
the tendons and the cartilage,

03:28.417 --> 03:30.658
causing him to break apart
into multiple pieces.

03:30.753 --> 03:33.244
Bones, you don’t have to
get so excited, okay?
This is not a game.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.838
Yes, yes!
A winner.
Ooh.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.127

it’s called Tree of Heaven,

04:26.142 --> 04:28.258
and we find it
clogging a sewer pipe.

04:28.352 --> 04:31.594
There’s a joke in there somewhere,
if anyone wants to knock it loose.

04:31.689 --> 04:35.398
- Thanks. I’ll pass.
- | see the irony.
I don’t see the joke.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.224
But this stage
in my pregnancy,

04:37.319 --> 04:40.277
my |.Q. could be eight to 10 points
lower than normal.

04:40.364 --> 04:44.073
Which is why we all need
to pitch in and help out
every way we can.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.993

near my cervix, Ms. Wick.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.908
Just saying, should you
find yourself in need.

04:54.003 --> 04:55.584
I could stop
at the perineum.

04:55.671 --> 04:57.172
What I need to know...

04:57.256 --> 04:59.542
is what progress you’ve made
with the bones.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.841
We only have fragments,
so it’s difficult to determine much.

05:02.928 --> 05:05.385
But since there’s no
duplication of elements,

05:05.473 --> 05:07.589
the remains originate
from one victim.

05:07.683 --> 05:11.221
And I have found enough bones
that form the maxillary sinus...

05:11.312 --> 05:13.018
to indicate the victim is male.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.266

Ooh. What can you tell me
about the, uh, spice-a-chino?

06:11.080 --> 06:12.286
It’s like a cappuccino,

06:12.373 --> 06:14.364
but with four different spices.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.198
Just get on with this,
so I don’t have to
look at that thing.

06:16.335 --> 06:18.576
What do you have against
a cappuccino machine?
This is a diner.

06:18.671 --> 06:21.538
I come here because there is
no cappuccino machine.

Some things, they
need to be sacred.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.673

All right?

06:25.761 --> 06:29.720
In this country, there is a line
between coffee and foamy crap.

06:29.807 --> 06:32.173

people, they become animals.

- Rob Lazebnik.
- Lazebnik. That name
sounds familiar.

08:30.594 --> 08:33.051
Did you, uh, run it
through the N.C.|.C.?

08:33.138 --> 08:35.094
Yep. Lazebn/k
was a fugitive.

08:35.182 --> 08:39.676
He escaped from the federal
penitentiary at Jamestown
four weeks ago.

08:39.770 --> 08:43.103
Well, it looks ilke he was
better off behind bars.

08:45.484 --> 08:49.022
So someone killed my husband.
No surprise there.

08:49.113 --> 08:51.525
He was ripping off his clients.
It was a Ponzi scheme.

08:51.657 --> 08:53.943
Like a Bernie Madoff?
[ Chuckles ]
If only.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.525
Madoff’s wife ended up
with something to live on.

08:56.620 --> 08:59.783
Rob burned through
everything he ever had.

08:59.915 --> 09:03.703
Must have been fun
while it lasted.
Oh, yeah, for him.

09:03.794 --> 09:05.534
He got to act
like a high roller.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.210
He blew it all at casinos,
buying fancy yachts.

09:07.297 --> 09:08.628
And there were plenty
of hookers.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.502
There wasn’t a dime
left for me.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.298
Right. So who did your husband
try to contact...

09:12.386 --> 09:13.876
after he escaped from prison?

09:13.971 --> 09:15.552
For help? Nobody.

09:15.639 --> 09:17.300
Robby burned
every bridge he had.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.632
Which means that leaves you.
Did he try and contact you?

09:19.727 --> 09:21.012
Not a chance.

09:21.103 --> 09:23.344
I told that son of a bitch
I would slit his throat...

09:23.439 --> 09:25.054
if he ever tried
to talk to me again.

09:25.149 --> 09:26.810
Really?

09:28.485 --> 09:30.066
It’s a figure of speech.
Right.

09:30.154 --> 09:32.395
Probably best you don’t leave
town during this investigation.

09:32.489 --> 09:36.027
Don’t worry.
I can’t afford to.

09:38.454 --> 09:42.242
Almost all of the bones appear
to have been fractured postmortem.

09:42.332 --> 09:45.290
Yeah, well, they were
probably broken up so they
could fit down the drain.

09:45.377 --> 09:48.414
Booth is pressuring me
to have the baby in a hospital.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.006
Well, that’s not
his decision.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.581
Booth says that he’s worried
about complications,
but I’m healthy.

09:52.676 --> 09:57.295
And I don’t mean to be boastful,
but my mucosa! plug is superb.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.766
All right.
Girl’s got good plug.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.806
And now we all know.

10:01.894 --> 10:06.513
I ran a tox screen
on the ocular fluid,
and it came back negative.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.598
Which eliminates poison
as cause of death.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.273
You have anything?

10:10.360 --> 10:12.271
There’s a fragment
of the right ninth rib...

10:12.362 --> 10:14.774
with striations
that are consistent
with a stab wound.

10:14.865 --> 10:16.776
But there’s so little evidence,

10:16.867 --> 10:19.279
it would be irresponsible
for me to form a conclusion
at this point.

10:19.369 --> 10:22.202
Come on.
Just this once.

10:23.332 --> 10:24.788
No.
[ Saroyan ]
You can do it.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.283

it’s a stabbing.
I can’t.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.368

if you do.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.208
Well, I wanna be cool.

It’s adorable!

10:50.150 --> 10:51.811
What else
can you make it do?

10:51.902 --> 10:54.188
This is not a toy.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.440
Who am I kidding?
It’s the coolest toy ever.

10:56.532 --> 10:58.113
It’s a Sewerbot.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.192
And right now, its identical
twin is about to crawl
into the sewer pipes...

11:01.286 --> 11:03.618
by the house
with the magic toilet.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.367
Now, yourjob
is to stare at muck.

11:06.458 --> 11:10.076

if you see anything
that could be evidence.

[Clears Throat]

11:14.466 --> 11:17.003
Hmm. Nothing here.

Nothing yet.

11:21.098 --> 11:22.087
Nope.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.888
Still nothing.

Nothing there.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.551
Nada. Nothing.

11:27.646 --> 11:29.807

I thought—

11:30.816 --> 11:32.477
You’re right.

[ Exhales ]
Mm-mmm.

Mm-mmm.

Mm-mmm. Mm—

Do you think
| overstepped my bounds
by becoming a doula?

11:42.953 --> 11:44.909
Yes.
No, really.

11:44.997 --> 11:46.828
Yes, really.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.416
But it was so nice of me.

11:48.542 --> 11:51.033
It’s more creepy
than nice.
You’re joking.

11:51.128 --> 11:52.709
Wish I was.

12:06.351 --> 12:10.060
We have a lot of work today.
I don’t understand why we have
to spend any of it with Sweets.

12:10.147 --> 12:13.014
Bureau procedure.
You know how it is.
Right, Sweets?

12:13.108 --> 12:15.269
Yeah. Yeah.
So I need to, uh—

12:15.360 --> 12:18.568
I need to do a partner assessment
to see how you function,

12:18.655 --> 12:21.613
so Agent Booth can be paired
with the proper person
while you’re on leave.

12:21.742 --> 12:24.074
I’ve never heard
of such an assessment.
Well, it’s new.

12:24.202 --> 12:26.784
You know how the Bureau is.
[ Sweets ]
Yeah.

12:26.872 --> 12:28.612
[ Brennan]
Fine.

12:28.707 --> 12:31.039
- Then assess me.
- Let’s hurry it along here, Sweets.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.337
Okay. Uh, first question.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.379
Would you describe yourself
as overly cautious,

12:37.466 --> 12:39.206
uh, appropriately cautious...

12:39.301 --> 12:41.087
or a risk taker?

12:41.178 --> 12:43.009
Appropriately cautious.

12:44.514 --> 12:48.974
Okay. Do you tend
to make decisions
based on gut instinct...

12:49.061 --> 12:51.347
or on expertly compiled data?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.804
The latter.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.856
It’s— All right.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.309
Question three.

12:58.403 --> 13:02.612
How would it affect your
decision-making process if, uh,

13:02.699 --> 13:08.069
expertly compiled data
proved something conclusively...

13:08.163 --> 13:09.824
despite your belief system?

13:09.957 --> 13:12.619
I’d have to have
an example.
An example.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.995
Um, I don’t know.
Uh, out of nowhere?

13:15.087 --> 13:18.454
Uh, say, the safest place
to give birth...

13:18.548 --> 13:21.711
is in a well-respected
hospital or—

13:21.802 --> 13:23.713
Why are you looking
at me like that?

13:23.804 --> 13:27.717
You are using this partner
assessment to influence me
on a personal matter.

13:27.849 --> 13:30.010
That is extremely
unethical.
Wait.

13:30.102 --> 13:32.684
Assuming that psychologists
have ethics. I don’t know.

13:32.813 --> 13:37.807
Okay. Dr. Brennan,
perhaps the emotions that you’re
experiencing during pregnancy...

13:37.901 --> 13:41.564
are affecting what should be
a carefully reasoned decision.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.943
I mean, for your sake and
the baby’s, the safest place
to give birth is a hospital.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.900
No, that’s not true.
Are you the one who
has to undergo...

13:47.995 --> 13:50.486
wave after wave
of mind-searing pain...

13:50.580 --> 13:53.868
that only ends
after a writhing,
screaming object...

13:53.959 --> 13:57.747

a jack—o’-lantern...

No.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.090
- I thought you used
the word “watermelon.”
- I couldn’t think of the word.

14:04.177 --> 14:07.214
When you give birth to a baby,
you can make the decisions.

14:07.305 --> 14:10.092
Right now, I don’t want to
hear any more about this
from you. Understood?

14:10.183 --> 14:11.719
- Yes, ma’am.
- Sweets.

14:11.810 --> 14:14.517
The two of you should be
ashamed of yourselves!

14:14.604 --> 14:16.856
- Nice going.
- Oh, okay, okay.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.397

our friendship stronger.
No soccer.

Don’t say that.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.281
This looks like
part of his tibia.
And some teeth.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.533
Yeah, well, enjoy it,
’cause it’s our last.

14:34.624 --> 14:37.912
The Sewerbot’s reached
the end of the line.

14:38.003 --> 14:41.086
Why would there be bars
in a sewer?

14:41.173 --> 14:42.959
I don’t know.

14:47.471 --> 14:50.178
Because the sewer line ends
at Jamestown federal prison.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.426
Wait a minute.
This guy never escaped.

14:52.517 --> 14:56.101
He was killed in prison
and then dumped in the sewer.

15:04.362 --> 15:06.739
Jamestown’s a hard-core
lockup, all right,

15:06.823 --> 15:08.438
so just stay close to me.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.525
No eye contact.
And I want you to keep
an arm’s length from the bars.

15:11.620 --> 15:14.282
Prisoners won’t hurt a child.
It’s one of their strongest taboos.

15:14.372 --> 15:18.115
And since I am obviously
just a few weeks from delivery,

15:18.210 --> 15:20.292

I will be safe.

15:20.378 --> 15:22.369

okay,Bones?

how to compromise.
- I can compromise.

Mm-hmm.

15:32.390 --> 15:35.678

It helps them make sense
of the world.

and so does your Bible.

won’t let her stay there,

and I will make sure

Anything new, Ms. Wick?

16:11.012 --> 16:15.051
We have so many pieces of bone,
and I haven’t found any evidence
of kerf marks.

So, he wasn’t cut up
with a knife or a saw.

16:17.978 --> 16:20.435
Absolutely not.
His bones are fractured.

[ Exhales ]

16:22.816 --> 16:25.478
Do you smell roses?
Yes. Rosewater.

16:25.569 --> 16:28.652
It’s a uterine relaxant.
I learned about it
in doula class.

16:28.738 --> 16:31.275
Uh, it’s inert, so it won’t
compromise the bones.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.152
You put rosewater
on the bones?

16:33.243 --> 16:38.283
Yep! So, when Dr. Brennan’s working,
she will also be relaxing, uterinely.

16:38.373 --> 16:41.957
And the bones needed
a little freshening up
after four weeks in the sewer.

16:42.043 --> 16:44.295
Who— Who wouldn’t?

16:44.379 --> 16:47.997
Not all these breaks
happened after he died.

16:48.091 --> 16:51.504
I found some remodeled
fracturing of the manubrium,

16:51.595 --> 16:55.053
the distal end
of the left clavicle
and two of the upper ribs.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.847
Those breaks occurred
about a year ago.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.266
That’s when Lazebnik
went to jail.

17:00.353 --> 17:03.015
He must’ve been beaten
when he got there.

show evidence that he
was beaten a year ago.

17:14.326 --> 17:16.567
No surprise there.
The food here’s
all cooked by the inmates.

17:16.661 --> 17:19.619
- The beef stew isn’t half bad.
- So you know about the beatings?

17:19.748 --> 17:22.410
He was probably beaten to
learn the prison hierarchy.
Exactly.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.411
Hey, you want some beef stew,
you let me know.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.663
My wife was always starving
before she burst.

but I’m a vegetarian.
So’s my wife.

Then she can’t eat enough cow.
You should try the lasagn—

17:32.302 --> 17:35.886
I’m not your wife.
Lazebnik was dumped into
the sewer system in pieces.

17:35.972 --> 17:39.556
I’ll need to see the blueprints
for the prison to see what
drains could have been used.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.515
Sure. Operations
should have those.
Right.

17:41.645 --> 17:43.260
How about a cookie then?
Who did it, pal?

17:43.355 --> 17:45.220
- | baked it myself.
- No, the beating.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.930
Which one of these
Boy Scouts beat him?

17:47.025 --> 17:49.767
It’s impossible to tell.
They pick their target.

17:49.861 --> 17:52.523
They form a ring around.
You can’t see inside.
Then they go to town on him.

17:52.614 --> 17:55.481
Another prisonerjumped in
and broke it up before any
of us guards got out there.

17:55.617 --> 17:57.949
You know
who broke it up?
Yep. He’s right there.

But he won’t talk.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.823
Ha. Let me give him a try.
You check out the blueprints.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.827
So, Daisy said the bones
were so fragmented...

18:08.922 --> 18:11.914
that it could take days
to piece them back together
by hand.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.385
So I did a digital
reconstruction.

18:15.762 --> 18:19.129
Now, the red
indicates the bones
that we’re missing.

18:19.224 --> 18:21.886
Dr. Brennan found striations
on the right ninth rib...

18:21.977 --> 18:24.013
that indicated
the possibility
of a stab wound.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.560
Once we had more bones
to look at,

18:25.647 --> 18:28.810
I found a nick
on the anterior aspect
of the L1 vertebra...

18:28.900 --> 18:31.277
that confirmed the victim
was stabbed in the abdomen.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.562
Because she’s Brennan.

18:35.657 --> 18:38.820
Okay, so, the knife
went in at the rib...

18:38.910 --> 18:40.901
and stopped
when it hit the spine.

18:40.996 --> 18:43.203
That’s nine inches
and change.

18:43.290 --> 18:46.123
And it’d be difficult to find
a knife that long in prison.

18:46.209 --> 18:48.666
Hmm. What if he doubled over?

18:51.298 --> 18:54.085
This compresses the distance
between the rib and the L1.

18:54.175 --> 18:57.167
Yes, to 3.75 inches.

18:57.262 --> 19:00.095
Is it possible to add
the major abdominal
blood vessels?

19:00.181 --> 19:01.512
Sure.

19:03.018 --> 19:05.930
If the weapon began
at the right ninth rib
and nicked the L1,

19:06.021 --> 19:08.683
the inferior vena cava would
be directly in its path.

19:08.773 --> 19:11.105
That would cause massive
internal hemorrhaging.

19:11.192 --> 19:13.399
Looks like we have
our cause of death.

19:16.614 --> 19:19.105
If they say I knew Lazebnik,
then I guess I knew him.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.906
But I didn’t
help him escape.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.950
I’ve only got two weeks
left in here.

19:23.038 --> 19:24.699
I wouldn’t risk
screwing up now.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.743
Lazebnik didn’t escape.
What do you mean?

19:27.876 --> 19:29.787
He was killed in here.
What?

19:29.919 --> 19:31.625
Yeah.
Do they know who did it?

19:31.713 --> 19:33.419
No, but you should.

19:33.506 --> 19:37.169
We know you stepped in
and saved Lazebnik from getting
a beating about a year ago.

19:37.260 --> 19:40.002
So, we know you two
were looking out
for each other, right?

19:40.096 --> 19:43.179
I just did what
I would do for a friend.
That’s it.

19:43.266 --> 19:45.973
Tell me about the beating.
Who was after him?

19:47.020 --> 19:48.510
I told you.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.812
I’m getting released
in two weeks.

19:50.899 --> 19:53.891
But it ain’t gonna mean much
if I’m dead before that.

19:53.985 --> 19:55.816
I can make sure
that doesn’t happen.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.105
- Not a chance.
- Fine. I’ll just extend your stay.

20:00.241 --> 20:01.777
You can’t do that.
Oh, yeah?

[ Man ]
Fifteen minutes.

20:13.588 --> 20:15.453
Okay.

20:18.635 --> 20:21.217
The last time I saw Lazebnik,

20:21.304 --> 20:23.716
the warden had just pulled him
off his job in accounting...

20:23.807 --> 20:25.388
because she needed to see him.

20:25.517 --> 20:29.180
Why?
Dude was in here for
financial fraud or whatever.

20:29.270 --> 20:31.647
Then he does the books
for this place.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.398
Put it together yourself.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.897
All I know is...

20:37.987 --> 20:41.650
he went to the warden’s office,
and I never saw him again.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.778
Just don’t say
you heard it from me.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.244
They sic a guard on me,

20:48.331 --> 20:51.789
I might wind up in a wheelchair
for the rest of my life.

20:53.461 --> 20:55.838
I don’t know how Lazebnik
got assigned to accounting.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.753
Is that not
your responsibility?

20:57.841 --> 21:00.583
l have a lot of responsibilities.
That’s why I delegate.

21:00.677 --> 21:03.589
When I found out
where he was assigned,
I pulled him off thejob.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.545
That’s all that matters.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.427
There are over 500 drains
that Lazebnik could’ve
been dumped in.

21:08.518 --> 21:12.056
It would take weeks
for us to check
every single one of ’em.

21:12.147 --> 21:15.139
Should you be on a case?
You look like you’re ready
to give birth here.

21:15.233 --> 21:18.145
That’s exactly why we’d
like to move this along.
Shall we now?

21:18.236 --> 21:20.443
I don’t know
how he got the job
in the first place,

21:20.530 --> 21:24.443
but it was a no-brainer for me
to transfer him once I found
some funds had gone missing.

21:24.534 --> 21:27.025
Gone missing? I’m sorry.
Why didn’t you tell me
that on the phone?

21:27.120 --> 21:29.577
Lazebnik siphoned off
a small amount—
Iess than 500.

21:29.664 --> 21:32.155
- I nipped it in the bud.
- Doesn’t make you look good,
now, does it?

21:32.250 --> 21:34.081
A prisoner
stealing from you.

21:34.169 --> 21:36.706
Rob Lazebnik was a criminal,
and criminals steal.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.502
There was nothing unusual
about it.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.668
The judge would’ve given him
another six months.
[Cell Phone Rings]

21:43.011 --> 21:45.593
- [Cell Phone Rings, Beeps]
- This is Brennan.

21:45.680 --> 21:50.424
I’ve got a new one
for your big book
of stereolithographic firsts.

21:50.518 --> 21:52.804
I don’t have that book.
Okay.

21:52.896 --> 21:54.602
Doesn’t matter.

21:54.731 --> 21:57.814
I used the vector points of
the victim’s internal wounds—
[ Beeping ]

21:57.901 --> 22:00.108
to make a negative
of the murder weapon.

22:00.195 --> 22:05.906
And from that, I could print out
a positive 3-D image of it.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.529
It’s conical,
3.75 in length.

22:08.620 --> 22:10.110
it’s a Shiv.

22:10.205 --> 22:13.072
The dimensions
of the murder weapon
indicate that it was a shiv.

22:13.166 --> 22:14.997
So when’s the last time
you tossed the cells?

22:15.084 --> 22:17.917
We did a full sweep
just last week.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.173
Oh. Wow.

22:24.302 --> 22:26.088
Knock yourself out.
All right. Wow.

22:26.179 --> 22:28.010
There’s a lot of ’em
here, huh, Bones?

22:28.097 --> 22:30.053
Lots of blood too.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.516
This is really excellent
field technique.

22:40.610 --> 22:45.730
Each one of these shivs
is tagged with the number of
the cell in which it was found.

22:45.823 --> 22:48.951
It will be useful if I find
the likely murder weapon.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.447
Bones, don’t you think
you’d be better off
backinthelab?

22:51.538 --> 22:54.746
No. We are far more
effective on-site.

22:54.832 --> 22:57.039
Plus, we have the equipment
from the infirmary.

22:57.126 --> 22:59.913
You’re about to pop,
and I’m looking at 148
homemade murder weapons.

23:00.004 --> 23:02.495
I think you’d be better off
back at the lab.
More effective.

23:02.590 --> 23:04.797
- Okay, let’s go.
- Booth, look at this one.

23:04.926 --> 23:07.918
It’s nasty.
It matches the photo
Angela sent us.

23:08.012 --> 23:10.298
I am quite certain
this is the murder weapon.

23:10.390 --> 23:12.426
Eh, we could have
a winner, huh?

23:12.517 --> 23:17.102
The tag on this one
says that it was found
in cell number YZO3.

23:17.188 --> 23:19.304
Y203 isn’t a cell.
It’s an area of the yard.

23:19.399 --> 23:22.391
- Who has access to that?
- Every convict who isn’t
sick or in solitary.

23:22.485 --> 23:24.692
Looks like this is
made from paper.

23:24.779 --> 23:27.191
- Paper?
- Strong, heavy stock.

23:27.282 --> 23:29.944
Tightly compressed,
glued together.

23:30.034 --> 23:32.411
It’s a very effective weapon.

23:32.495 --> 23:33.996
[ Booth ]
Now what?

23:49.846 --> 23:51.632
There’s something
printed on this.

23:51.723 --> 23:56.012
If Angela can find out where
this paper came from, it might
lead us back to the killer.

24:08.906 --> 24:11.283
How’s it goin’?

24:11.367 --> 24:13.107
Not well.

24:13.202 --> 24:16.365
I thought it! sat at
Dr. Brennan’s desk and looked
at these bones like she does,

24:16.456 --> 24:18.913
it would clarify things
for me.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.163
Eh! It’s no use!
I still can’t figure it out!

24:22.253 --> 24:27.247
There are no kerf marks
at the ends of the humeri,
the tibias or either femur.

24:27.342 --> 24:30.049
Uh, why is that a problem?

24:30.136 --> 24:33.970
Because it means that
the body wasn’t dismembered
with a cutting implement.

24:34.057 --> 24:36.639
I have no idea
how the remains
were broken up.

24:36.726 --> 24:39.513
- You’ll get it.
- You know what might help?

24:39.604 --> 24:42.471
No.No,uh,Da—
We can’t.

24:42.565 --> 24:44.601
Not in this office.
Not in any office.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.774
Well, I need
a distraction.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.986
It clears the mind.

24:51.074 --> 24:55.864
Daisy, we can’t!
The walls are glass.

24:55.953 --> 24:58.410
We don’t
have to take off
all our clothes.

24:58.498 --> 25:00.864
And those crates
will block us.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.117
I know you want to.
I don’t. I don’t.

25:05.213 --> 25:08.455
Your nose is growing,
Pinocchio.

25:10.093 --> 25:11.958
All right.
[ Laughing ]

25:15.932 --> 25:19.095
Oh, wait, Lance!
[Giggling]

25:19.185 --> 25:20.721
Ooh!

25:20.812 --> 25:23.269
Oh, no! Oh, no.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.273
- Wait a minute.
- Really?

25:27.360 --> 25:28.896
There’s micro-pitting
on these.

25:28.986 --> 25:30.647
And I totally
missed the point.

25:30.738 --> 25:33.980
I thought it was decomp
from the sewage,
but it’s not.

25:34.075 --> 25:36.361
It means the bones
were exposed to acid.

25:36.452 --> 25:38.317
That could be how
the body was dismembered.

25:38.413 --> 25:41.655
See, I told you that I just
needed to clear my mind.

25:41.749 --> 25:43.785
- This is great!
- Not so much for me.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.492
I have to show these
to Dr. Hodgins.

25:46.587 --> 25:47.997
Now?

25:48.089 --> 25:49.545
Uh-huh!

25:49.632 --> 25:52.795
Thank you, Lancelot!
Thank you!

25:55.263 --> 25:57.128
All right.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.965
Oh. Hi.
l was looking for, uh—

26:00.101 --> 26:01.841
Hmm.
I dropped a thing
down here.

26:01.936 --> 26:04.302
Why is my coat like that?
I looked— l was looking for—

26:04.397 --> 26:06.763
l’m down here
’cause I— I lost a—

26:07.650 --> 26:09.390
[Sighs]

26:11.821 --> 26:13.812
[ Man Shouting]

26:15.908 --> 26:19.025
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Ho-ho!

26:19.120 --> 26:21.156
This is
the Mailbox Works.

26:21.247 --> 26:24.330
The prison’s been building
them for the postal service
since 1957.

26:24.459 --> 26:26.199
And they use acid
in the process?
Sure.

26:26.294 --> 26:29.627
They clean the mailboxes
in an acid bath
before the paint goes on.

26:29.714 --> 26:32.456
- Hydrochloric.
- Definitely could’ve dropped
a body in there, Bones.

26:32.550 --> 26:33.881
Certainly large enough.

26:33.968 --> 26:36.334
I’ll take samples
and have them sent back
to the lab...

26:36.429 --> 26:38.340
to see if the acid matches
the damage to the bones.

26:38.431 --> 26:41.218
Look, I need a roster of
the work crew for the night
that Lazebnik disappeared.

26:41.350 --> 26:43.432
You got it?
You got it.

26:43.519 --> 26:48.684
[Man ] Yeah, /’ve been
supervisor of the Mai/box Works
for 0 ver a year now. So ?

26:48.775 --> 26:51.391
So, Lazebnik, he took
advantage of your parents,
didn’t he, huh?

26:51.486 --> 26:54.444
- Wiped out their
entire life savings?
- I’m sayin’ nothin’.

26:54.530 --> 26:57.863
Somebody does that
to my family,
I’d wanna kill him too.

26:59.243 --> 27:01.359
What would I do?
I’d make myself a shiv.

27:01.496 --> 27:04.158
I didn’t make no shiv.
You’re in charge of the
paint crew, aren’t you?

27:04.248 --> 27:06.625
You could’ve easily
disposed of the body
in the acid bath.

27:06.709 --> 27:09.075
Look, I didn’t kill Lazebnik.
I never killed anybody.

27:09.170 --> 27:11.456
You gave him a good beating
when he showed up
in Jamestown.

27:11.547 --> 27:14.004
- What was that, about a year ago?
- Who told you about that?

27:14.801 --> 27:16.917
That was a lucky guess.

27:17.011 --> 27:19.753
You’re getting things
out of me I didn’t say,
so we’re done here.

27:19.847 --> 27:21.257
I’ll tell you
when we’re done.

27:21.349 --> 27:23.590
I may have to sit here.
Nothin’ I can do about that.

27:23.684 --> 27:26.016
But I’m sayin’ nothin’ else
without a lawyer, so—

27:29.148 --> 27:31.309
[ Booth ] There you go.
Trust me, okay?
He’s the guy.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.812
Okay, what, I’m just supposed
to accept your hunch?

27:33.903 --> 27:36.189
He’s got motive.
He’s got his own
personal acid bath.

27:36.322 --> 27:39.439
What more do you want?
That is all circumstantial,
Booth, and you know it.

27:39.575 --> 27:41.566
You’re pressuring me.
You look tired.

27:41.661 --> 27:43.697
I mean,
you look exhausted.
I can see it.

27:43.788 --> 27:45.995

aren’t going anywhere.

Let’s just—
Let’s just get back home.
We’ll get some sleep.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.672
We’ll come back
if we have to.

27:53.756 --> 27:55.667
Look, Bones, you’re
not Superwoman, okay?

27:55.758 --> 27:58.670
You’re nine months pregnant.
You can’t overexert yourself.

27:58.761 --> 28:00.262
Even you know that.

28:01.264 --> 28:02.800
Look at me. Hey.

28:02.890 --> 28:04.346
I love you.

28:04.433 --> 28:08.267

to this child, I would die.

get some rest.

28:11.524 --> 28:14.266

tomorrow. Okay?

28:15.611 --> 28:17.067

28:19.615 --> 28:21.116
Oh. Brennan.
Tomato.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.112
I just finished testing
hydrochloric acid
on some bone,

28:24.203 --> 28:26.535
all different
concentrations.

28:26.622 --> 28:28.874
The micro-pitting
does not match.

28:28.958 --> 28:31.074
There is another kind
of acid in that prison.

28:31.168 --> 28:32.874
Now what?
We have to go back in.

28:32.962 --> 28:34.702
No, we do not
have to go back in.

28:34.797 --> 28:37.504
It wasn’t hydrochloric acid,
Booth. There’s some other
acid in there.

28:37.592 --> 28:39.708
I know how fast word
travels in prison.

28:39.802 --> 28:41.838
And the killer could be
destroying evidence already.

28:41.929 --> 28:44.545
No, Bones, we don’t
have to go back in.
Let’s just turn around and—

28:44.640 --> 28:46.631
What did Ijust say?
We don’t have to go back in.

28:48.853 --> 28:51.560
[Alarm Beeps ]
We have to do this,
Booth.

28:51.647 --> 28:53.228
I’ll give you 15 minutes.

28:53.316 --> 28:55.773
I need to find out
if there’s another source
of acid in the prison.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.475
And I need you
to do that fast for us.

28:57.570 --> 29:00.152
There’s only hydrochloric
in the Mailbox Works.
I can’t think of any other.

- Bones, you all right?

29:03.242 --> 29:05.574
Yes. It’s just

for the past month.

Then that’s exactly
why we should—
Brennan.

29:08.998 --> 29:10.659
[Alarm Beeping ]
Oh!

29:10.750 --> 29:14.163
I was able to restore part of
the text from the paper scraps
that you sent me.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.835
One contains
a fraction— one-third.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.831
And the letters A-R—G—A-R.
Turn around.

29:19.926 --> 29:22.087
It comes from the word
“margarine.”

29:22.178 --> 29:24.669
And the one-third
is a one-third of a cup.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.846
The papers were
from a cookbook.

29:26.974 --> 29:30.387
Eight different pages.
Well, is there any way
to tell which cookbook?

29:30.478 --> 29:33.686
I ran the typeface through
the Library of Congress database,

29:33.773 --> 29:35.934
and I got the name
and the date of publication...

29:36.025 --> 29:38.482
and a lot of tips
on how to cook
for prisoners.

29:38.569 --> 29:43.108
it’s the Gordon Institutional
Recipe Index, 7993 edition.

29:43.199 --> 29:45.406
A pparent/y prisoners
really like cookies.

29:45.493 --> 29:49.202
Okay, we need a copy of
The Gordon institutional
Recipe lndeX.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.950
The 1993 edition.
There should be at least
eight pages missing.

29:52.041 --> 29:54.783
-l have no idea what that is.
-That’ll be in the kitchen, ace.

29:54.877 --> 29:57.334
Oh, sure. Uh, I’ll get it
for you right now.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.332
No, just show us
where the kitchen is.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.080
I’d like to see it
in context.
No,no,no.

30:01.217 --> 30:03.082
You’re gonna sit tight, okay?
I’ll go get it.
Why?

30:03.219 --> 30:05.255
’Cause I don’t want
our baby born in a prison.
Why not?

30:05.346 --> 30:07.337
Their infirmary is an accredited
health care facility.

30:07.431 --> 30:08.932
Isn’t that what you wanted?

30:10.184 --> 30:12.175
That drain
by the coffee makers,

30:12.269 --> 30:15.557
uh, is big enough
to flush the bones.

30:16.691 --> 30:19.933
Hey, look at that, Bones.
No screws.

30:20.027 --> 30:23.611
- Found it.
- Found it. Okay, great.
Let’s head back. Come on.

30:23.698 --> 30:25.359
Come on.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.573
And there’s pages missing.

30:28.661 --> 30:31.494
Whoever ripped these out
must’ve left their prints
on the opposite page.

30:31.580 --> 30:33.866
- Let’s head to the lab
so you can pull the prints.
- No time.

30:33.958 --> 30:36.700
- We have to lift the prints here.
- We don’t have a print kit.

30:36.794 --> 30:38.284
We do now.

30:38.379 --> 30:40.995

Right. Cocoa.

30:41.090 --> 30:43.376
[ Guard ]
Cocoa?

30:57.106 --> 30:59.347
I’ll send these prints
to Angela.

30:59.817 --> 31:02.809
I found some particulates in the pitting.
Ran them through the mass spec.

31:02.903 --> 31:04.689
They turned out
to be a synthetic rubber.

31:04.780 --> 31:08.022
Look, this formulation
is made by one...

31:08.117 --> 31:10.699
and only one manufacturer—
in Dayton, Ohio.

31:10.786 --> 31:13.277
They use it
to make shoes
for prisoners.

31:14.498 --> 31:16.204
Yes, of course!

31:16.292 --> 31:20.410
His bones would be super brittle
after being immersed
in hydrochloric acid.

31:20.504 --> 31:23.871
The killer stomped on his bones
so they’d fit down a drain.

31:23.966 --> 31:27.083
And that’s how
the rubber got on them.
We are brilliant!

31:27.178 --> 31:31.091
Yeah. Except it wasn’t
hydrochloric acid.

31:31.182 --> 31:34.299
And there don’t seem
to be any other acids
at the prison.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.975
Angela said that Lazebnik
was killed with a cookbook.

31:37.104 --> 31:39.846
Are there any acids
in a kitchen?
Hmm, I mean, vinegar.

31:39.940 --> 31:43.603
But a little hard to dissolve
someone in salad dressing.

31:45.279 --> 31:46.940
Unless—

31:49.784 --> 31:52.321
This is gonna be good,
isn’t it?
I hope so.

31:53.704 --> 31:57.162
