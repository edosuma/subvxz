WEBVTT

00:15.143 --> 00:16.936
Good morning, angel.

00:18.939 --> 00:20.941
Get up. Let's go shopping.

00:52.889 --> 00:56.560
What you don't even know,
I'm a deadbeat man

00:56.643 --> 00:58.061
Never know when to fold

00:58.145 --> 00:59.604
What's wrong, Leia?
It's a little bumpy.

00:59.688 --> 01:01.273
You're hittin' the brakes
a little too much.

01:01.898 --> 01:03.942
Fuckin' up the vibe back here.
What's goin' on?

01:06.235 --> 01:08.780
Far away from my home

01:08.864 --> 01:11.907
In this hot ass town,
but my blood still cold

01:11.992 --> 01:15.662
And better let them know

01:15.746 --> 01:21.168
When you see them that you
make sure they pay you

01:21.251 --> 01:24.628
Pay you in cash

01:24.713 --> 01:27.674
I don't do favors

01:27.758 --> 01:31.261
I don't do that

01:31.344 --> 01:34.764
You don't want to see me

01:34.848 --> 01:38.143
See me get mad

01:38.226 --> 01:41.730
No matter how bad you

01:41.813 --> 01:46.485
You think I am, am

01:46.568 --> 01:48.528
I'm a lesser man

01:49.404 --> 01:51.406
A lesser man

01:51.907 --> 01:55.077
A lesser man than you think I am

01:55.160 --> 01:56.369
Oh, Valentino.

01:56.453 --> 01:57.537
Right there.
Stop right here, stop right here!

02:00.457 --> 02:02.751
I'm a lesser man

02:07.130 --> 02:10.092
I'm a lesser man

02:10.175 --> 02:11.760
Hi, how are you?

02:13.678 --> 02:14.513
Joss?

02:17.557 --> 02:18.642
Thank you.

02:23.772 --> 02:25.649
Thank you so much.

02:28.944 --> 02:30.570
Hi, how are you?

02:32.823 --> 02:34.074
-Hi.
-Welcome in.

02:34.157 --> 02:36.827
-Thank you.
-Good to see you. Welcome.

02:50.382 --> 02:53.218
-You see that young lady over there?
-Yeah.

02:53.301 --> 02:55.554
Got anything in the store
as beautiful as she is?

02:55.637 --> 02:57.389
-I think we can find some things.
-Great.

02:58.682 --> 03:00.350
It's good champagne, what is this?

03:00.434 --> 03:02.227
It's a Valentino exclusive.

03:02.310 --> 03:03.478
Oh, my God.

03:04.020 --> 03:05.439
-Oh, my God.
-You like it?

03:05.522 --> 03:06.731
It's so fuckin' sexy.

03:06.815 --> 03:08.650
I just wanna fuckin' tear this
right off of you.

03:09.818 --> 03:11.153
That looks amazing.
Alright, what else they got?

03:11.236 --> 03:12.112
What else they got? Look at that.

03:15.532 --> 03:17.993
Love that. Oh, my God.
Beautiful.

03:18.076 --> 03:20.078
I mean, you can make it a little
more skimpier somehow.

03:20.162 --> 03:21.496
Just this with heels? All you need.

03:21.580 --> 03:23.206
Joss, we're gonna try these shoes out.

03:23.290 --> 03:25.417
I don't like flats. Do you like these?

03:25.500 --> 03:27.544
Yeah, they're cute. It's for the house.

03:27.627 --> 03:28.879
There you go. Look at that.

03:28.962 --> 03:30.547
Are these a seven?

03:30.630 --> 03:32.799
Yes. I believe so.

03:32.883 --> 03:34.134
Thank you.

03:36.636 --> 03:37.929
Think they look nice.

03:38.013 --> 03:39.848
Baby, I believe that you're a star

03:39.931 --> 03:42.350
But this is great, though.
Let me keep this. Great job.

03:42.434 --> 03:44.144
How about this top here?
It will go well with--

03:44.227 --> 03:45.395
No, it's trash.

03:45.479 --> 03:47.272
What's up with this guy over here?
What's his story?

03:47.856 --> 03:50.358
He's great. He's been with us for a while.
Yeah.

03:50.442 --> 03:51.985
-Really? Can't be that good.
-Yeah.

03:52.069 --> 03:54.821
This is a beautiful top here.
I think she'll love this one.

03:54.905 --> 03:55.906
I don't think so.

03:55.989 --> 03:57.824
-Oh my--
-That's a great look.

03:59.284 --> 04:00.410
-Do you like it?
-Yeah.

04:01.912 --> 04:03.914
Let me catch you lookin' at her again.

04:04.873 --> 04:06.500
Let me catch you lookin' at her again.

04:06.583 --> 04:08.585
-I'm not--
-Let me catch you lookin' at her again.

04:08.668 --> 04:09.795
-I'm sorry. I'm not--
-Let me fuckin' catch you

04:09.878 --> 04:11.713
lookin' at her again,
I'll fuckin' drag you down Rodeo

04:11.797 --> 04:14.299
by your fuckin' ass,
just fuckin' stomp you.

04:14.382 --> 04:15.759
-I'll fuckin' curb-stomp you.
-I'm sorry.

04:15.842 --> 04:17.719
I'll fuckin' curb-stomp you.

04:17.803 --> 04:20.430
I'm sorry. I don't--
I'm not sure what you were interpreting,

04:20.514 --> 04:21.848
-but I wasn't doing anything.
-Let me see it.

04:21.932 --> 04:23.475
-Let me see it.
-Chaim?

04:23.558 --> 04:25.811
Leia, I called you 14 fucking times,
where are you?

04:25.894 --> 04:27.354
Wait, are you at the house?

04:27.437 --> 04:28.772
Of course, I'm at the fucking house.

04:28.855 --> 04:30.941
You say, "911," I come to the house, Leia.

04:31.024 --> 04:33.944
Yo, I told you.
This bitch is fuckin' brain-dead.

04:34.027 --> 04:35.112
Chaim, I'm really scared.

04:35.195 --> 04:38.657
This guy, Tedros, has just,
like, taken over the fucking house.

04:40.033 --> 04:41.284
Gun. Gun.

04:42.452 --> 04:44.621
What does that mean,
"He's taken over the house," Leia?

04:44.704 --> 04:46.832
Well, this morning
I'm sitting in the kitchen

04:46.915 --> 04:48.166
and I'm talking to Andrés.

04:48.250 --> 04:50.836
He just walks in, and he fires him.

04:50.919 --> 04:52.254
Look, Leia,
I don't give a fuck about any of this.

04:52.337 --> 04:53.672
Where is Jocelyn right now?

04:53.755 --> 04:56.883
Well, we're shopping.

04:56.967 --> 04:59.386
You're fucking shop-- They're shopping.

04:59.469 --> 05:01.638
-This is some bullshit, man!
-What's the matter with you?

05:01.721 --> 05:03.974
I don't got time for this shit, man.

05:04.057 --> 05:05.809
I mean, are you fucking kidding?

05:05.892 --> 05:07.269
-It's hot as hell out here.
-You're shopping?

05:07.352 --> 05:09.563
Yo, I told you. This bitch is brain-dead.

05:09.646 --> 05:11.606
Like really, you have to see it.

05:11.690 --> 05:15.026
He's taken control of the house,
like, mentally.

05:15.110 --> 05:16.737
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm workin' with Jocelyn.

05:16.820 --> 05:19.322
Money's not an issue.
Yeah, I need him here today.

05:20.282 --> 05:21.867
So, when Mike Dean gets here,

05:21.950 --> 05:24.119
-that's Kanye's producer.
-Yeah.

05:24.202 --> 05:25.996
Where should he set up?

05:26.079 --> 05:28.039
I will talk to Jocelyn about it.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.668
I know it might be hard for you to,

05:31.752 --> 05:34.546
to digest this right now,
but I'm running the show.

05:34.629 --> 05:35.630
Okay.

05:37.299 --> 05:40.677
Sure, but I still have to talk to Jocelyn.

05:46.266 --> 05:47.476
Leia,

05:49.269 --> 05:50.812
are you fuckin' retarded?

05:51.772 --> 05:53.148
What did I just say?

05:54.107 --> 05:56.026
I'm running the show now.

05:58.361 --> 06:00.405
Cat-walk, cat-walk. Buy it.

06:00.489 --> 06:02.324
-We're getting this one.
-Should I try this?

06:02.407 --> 06:03.617
Love that.

06:04.409 --> 06:05.994
-Love that.
-It's a good look.

06:06.078 --> 06:08.080
-Maybe she does this one next?
-No. No, nope.

06:08.163 --> 06:10.165
-Nope. Nope.
-Sure?

06:12.459 --> 06:14.294
Fuckin' bitch.

06:14.836 --> 06:19.007
Chaim, you don't understand,
he's forcing us to shop.

06:19.091 --> 06:22.219
No, but he's brainwashed her.

06:22.302 --> 06:23.678
Okay? He has her brainwashed.

06:23.762 --> 06:26.640
-How're the probiotics working?
-So good. Look.

06:26.723 --> 06:28.683
-Oh, my God.
-So much better.

06:29.518 --> 06:30.977
You look amazing.

06:31.061 --> 06:33.396
So much better, right?

06:33.480 --> 06:37.067
Your body's just so tight.

06:37.150 --> 06:38.652
-You look amazing.
-Andrés!

06:39.736 --> 06:41.279
Do you mind not groping my girl?

06:42.781 --> 06:45.242
Tedros, you don't understand.

06:45.325 --> 06:46.743
-He's a--
-Boundaries.

06:46.827 --> 06:49.246
-My family are doctors.
-Are you a doctor?

06:49.329 --> 06:51.331
No, I'm not, but my sister and my father,

06:51.415 --> 06:52.874
they're both gastrointestinal doctors, so.

06:52.958 --> 06:54.876
My friend's a gynecologist.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.670
You don't see me stickin' my finger
in everybody, do you?

06:59.339 --> 07:02.175
Baby. Baby. It's okay.

07:06.805 --> 07:09.391
There's nothing okay about
what this creep just fuckin' did.

07:09.474 --> 07:10.350
Right?

07:16.606 --> 07:17.774
Get the fuck outta here.

07:18.734 --> 07:21.778
I'm sorry,
but I only take orders from my boss.

07:21.862 --> 07:23.405
Who? Her? Right there?

07:35.459 --> 07:38.170
Andrés, I'm really sorry, I just don't...

07:38.253 --> 07:41.256
I don't know
if this is the right fit anymore.

07:48.388 --> 07:49.556
It's been a real pleasure
working with you.

07:49.639 --> 07:50.974
I just--

07:51.725 --> 07:54.227
I wish you, like, all the best.

07:54.311 --> 07:57.230
That translates to
"get the fuck outta here," Andrés.

07:57.314 --> 07:58.648
Like, I'm serious.

07:58.732 --> 07:59.858
I'm driving down the road,

07:59.941 --> 08:01.485
he's eating her out
in the back of the car,

08:01.568 --> 08:02.944
like, I don't know what to do.

08:03.028 --> 08:05.197
And then he's, like,
making eye contact with me.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.575
And I'm pretty sure
that he called the paparazzi himself.

08:08.658 --> 08:10.202
-And like...
-Hold on.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.163
Hold on a second, Leia.

08:14.331 --> 08:15.916
Fink, what can I do for you?

08:15.999 --> 08:18.585
Chaim, are you trying to kill me?

08:19.294 --> 08:20.504
Not today.

08:20.587 --> 08:21.421
No, why?

08:21.505 --> 08:23.298
Do you want my children
to grow up without a father?

08:23.381 --> 08:24.257
Is that what this is?

08:24.341 --> 08:26.218
Fink, why would I wish that on anybody?

08:26.301 --> 08:27.636
Well, then let's cancel the tour.

08:27.719 --> 08:29.304
Fink, why are you saying this?

08:29.387 --> 08:31.389
The tour's gonna make millions of dollars.
What happened?

08:31.473 --> 08:33.767
Millions of doll-- Right now,
she's making me have IBS.

08:33.850 --> 08:36.561
I'm fuckin' shitting more blood
than a kid at Epstein's island.

08:36.645 --> 08:38.063
Has she ever let you down?

08:38.688 --> 08:42.234
Yeah. About 6.7 million times.
Remember that?

08:42.317 --> 08:44.653
Okay.
Except for that one unique circumstance.

08:45.404 --> 08:47.364
Why do you like
picking out clothes so much?

08:49.366 --> 08:50.951
Just need some taste, that's it.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.247
I have taste.

08:57.082 --> 08:57.916
Really?

08:58.500 --> 08:59.960
I know like when I was younger
but like now,

09:00.043 --> 09:01.294
you don't think I have taste?

09:02.671 --> 09:04.089
Not really, no.

09:05.799 --> 09:07.801
Last couple of days,
you had a lot of taste.

09:08.927 --> 09:10.220
You know what I think it is?

09:10.303 --> 09:13.098
-What?
-I think you're gay.

09:19.771 --> 09:20.981
I ain't gay.

09:23.066 --> 09:25.110
Even the way you said that
sounded really gay.

09:29.698 --> 09:32.367
Talk shit, huh? Talk shit, huh?
Talk shit?

09:32.451 --> 09:34.035
Talk shit? Talk shit?

09:34.494 --> 09:35.871
Talk shit? Come here.

09:41.543 --> 09:44.129
Nikki just called me and told me that
she's throwing away "World Class Sinner."

09:44.212 --> 09:45.630
The only fucking song

09:45.714 --> 09:47.424
that's actually selling
the fucking tickets.

09:47.507 --> 09:49.384
-She's fuckin' throwing it away?
-Hold on, hold on one second.

09:49.468 --> 09:50.510
-Is that true?
-Hold on.

09:50.594 --> 09:51.845
Turn up the car radio very loud.

09:51.928 --> 09:53.388
-Really loud.
-Okay, okay.

09:53.472 --> 09:54.598
Okay, I got it.

09:56.141 --> 09:57.476
Fink, I'm sorry, it's hard to hear.

09:57.559 --> 09:58.602
We're at the studio.

09:59.352 --> 10:01.313
You're with--
You're with Jocelyn right now?

10:01.396 --> 10:02.606
She just played me two new songs,

10:02.689 --> 10:04.441
they're gonna be fuckin'
massive by the way.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.360
Jocelyn has new music?

10:07.444 --> 10:09.905
Of course, she has music.
What's the matter with you?

10:09.988 --> 10:11.990
Well, why the fuck haven't I heard it?

10:12.074 --> 10:14.242
-Joss, hey, Joss?
-Yeah?

10:14.326 --> 10:16.203
It's Fink, he's completely freaking out.

10:16.286 --> 10:17.954
-Oh, my God! Why?
-No, no, no, no, no!

10:18.038 --> 10:18.997
Don't fuckin' tell her I'm worried!

10:19.081 --> 10:21.708
But he's not worried.
He's got complete faith in you.

10:21.792 --> 10:23.126
Okay, good.

10:23.210 --> 10:24.878
Tell him he needs to come over.

10:24.961 --> 10:27.089
-I miss him.
-Okay, Joss misses you, Fink.

10:27.172 --> 10:28.673
Well, fuckin' send the songs--

10:28.757 --> 10:30.133
Put me on speaker. Let me hear it.
I wanna hear 'em.

10:30.217 --> 10:31.593
We're really in the middle here.

10:31.676 --> 10:33.804
Let me, let me, let me hit you back.
Okay, man?

10:33.887 --> 10:34.930
No, no, no--

10:52.531 --> 10:53.365
Choke me.

10:53.448 --> 10:54.282
Oh fuck!

10:54.366 --> 10:55.826
Oh fuck.

10:55.909 --> 10:59.788
Oh fuck. Yeah, make me take it, Daddy.

11:01.540 --> 11:03.875
-Oh, I'm gonna cum! I'm gonna cum.
-No, don't cum inside me.

11:03.959 --> 11:05.293
-I'm gonna cum inside you.
-Don't cum inside me.

11:05.377 --> 11:06.503
-I'm gonna cum inside you.
-No, don't.

11:07.379 --> 11:08.505
-What?
-You can't cum inside me.

11:08.588 --> 11:09.714
That fuckin' hurt.

11:10.173 --> 11:11.133
-I'm sorry.
-Fuck's wrong with you?

11:11.216 --> 11:12.134
You can't cum inside me.

11:12.217 --> 11:13.260
Almost bent my fuckin' dick.

11:14.261 --> 11:15.720
What am I supposed to do?

11:15.804 --> 11:18.557
I don't know. Figure it out.

11:21.184 --> 11:22.769
-What are we gonna do, Chaim?
-Hold on, hold on.

11:22.853 --> 11:24.104
Turn the music down. You still there?

11:24.187 --> 11:25.939
I'm, like, really fucking scared.

11:26.022 --> 11:27.899
Like, what he was doing was just--

11:29.693 --> 11:31.194
It was just, like,
the scariest thing ever.

11:31.278 --> 11:33.905
Okay, calm down.
We'll be waiting here at the house.

11:38.326 --> 11:40.954
Soul to soul

11:41.621 --> 11:45.250
Keep fillin' up,
hips been unlocked, and I can't

11:47.377 --> 11:52.507
It's 2 in the morning, heels are gone

12:03.310 --> 12:04.561
-Hi.
-Hi.

12:04.644 --> 12:06.188
Keep fillin' up, hips been unlocked

12:06.271 --> 12:09.065
And I can't go

12:18.533 --> 12:19.743
Fuck.

12:26.958 --> 12:28.627
You're disgusting.

12:28.710 --> 12:30.712
I can't go

12:33.340 --> 12:35.634
Yeah, yeah, yeah

12:35.717 --> 12:37.552
Let's get the fuck outta here.

12:44.476 --> 12:46.937
'Scuse me, 'scuse me.

12:50.565 --> 12:52.401
Oh, my gosh. I love you so much!

12:53.276 --> 12:54.653
To satisfy

12:54.736 --> 12:58.490
Move, move!
I need you guys to fucking move!

13:04.621 --> 13:06.123
That's amazing.

13:52.961 --> 13:53.879
Here, you like that?

13:56.047 --> 13:57.257
Tedros.

13:58.550 --> 13:59.468
Chaim.

13:59.551 --> 14:00.552
Pleasure to meet you.

14:00.635 --> 14:02.220
This is Destiny, my partner.

14:02.304 --> 14:04.097
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

14:04.806 --> 14:06.099
What are you guys doing here?

14:06.183 --> 14:08.268
I can't just come by to say hello to you?

14:08.351 --> 14:10.937
You can. It's just usually you wanna
talk to me about something.

14:11.021 --> 14:14.149
Well, actually that song
you guys made together,

14:14.232 --> 14:15.692
I can't stop thinking about it.

14:15.776 --> 14:18.236
That's just one night of working together.

14:18.320 --> 14:19.488
Fuck off. Really?

14:20.155 --> 14:21.156
One night?

14:21.865 --> 14:23.408
So, you produced that song?

14:26.119 --> 14:28.080
Kinda produced it together.

14:28.163 --> 14:29.998
I know you guys are killing the song, but

14:30.082 --> 14:32.834
I really wanted to add choirs on it.

14:33.502 --> 14:36.797
I think choirs would sound
really good on that song.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.965
He just knows so much about music.

14:39.049 --> 14:40.550
It's kind of incredible.

14:40.634 --> 14:41.593
-It is.
-It really is.

14:41.676 --> 14:44.721
I mean, it's really impressive
for someone who's self-taught.

14:45.597 --> 14:47.390
I mean, it's almost unbelievable.

14:47.474 --> 14:48.642
I know. Almost.

14:48.725 --> 14:50.435
To what do we owe this good fortune?

14:50.519 --> 14:51.937
I mean, where are you from, man?

14:52.020 --> 14:53.855
How the fuck did you get here?

14:54.689 --> 14:57.067
-I'm from here. I'm--
-You're from LA?

14:57.150 --> 14:59.403
-Yeah.
-Yeah, but nobody's fuckin' from LA.

14:59.486 --> 15:00.779
-Right.
-Which part?

15:01.446 --> 15:02.697
Hollywood.

15:02.781 --> 15:04.199
-You grew up in Hollywood?
-Yeah.

15:05.700 --> 15:06.576
Me too.

15:06.660 --> 15:09.538
-No shit.
-Yes. Born and raised.

15:10.288 --> 15:11.665
What school did you go to?

15:12.624 --> 15:14.584
I wasn't the best student, unfortunately.

15:14.668 --> 15:16.294
I'm a little embarrassed.

15:16.378 --> 15:18.672
-Oh, you had got kicked out of school?
-Yeah.

15:18.755 --> 15:20.799
-So, what school? I--
-Dee.

15:20.882 --> 15:22.592
Why are you tryin' to, like,
make him feel bad

15:22.676 --> 15:24.636
about getting kicked out of school?

15:24.719 --> 15:26.138
Oh, my God.

15:26.555 --> 15:29.182
I am so sorry. Is that how you felt?

15:29.891 --> 15:32.185
I mean, to be honest,
I was kicked outta school, too.

15:32.269 --> 15:34.479
-The similarities, man.
-You got kicked out of high school?

15:34.563 --> 15:36.815
-I got kicked outta high school.
-Why?

15:36.898 --> 15:38.942
Beatin' fake-ass bitches' asses.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.444
No way.

15:43.947 --> 15:45.991
Why am I not surprised?

15:46.074 --> 15:49.786
So, Joss, you asked me
to buy you two weeks, yeah?

15:49.870 --> 15:52.748
So, do you folks have a plan?

15:52.831 --> 15:54.624
What's the next step here?

15:54.708 --> 15:55.751
I'm an amateur, right?

15:55.834 --> 15:57.210
So, I wanted to bring in somebody

15:57.294 --> 16:00.046
that can really synthesize
some of my ideas,

16:00.130 --> 16:01.715
so I reached out to Mike Dean.

16:01.798 --> 16:03.383
Are you familiar with Mike Dean?

16:03.467 --> 16:05.719
I mean, he's great.
I mean, he comes to my club all the time.

16:05.802 --> 16:07.846
Am I familiar with Mike Dean?

16:08.597 --> 16:09.890
Mike fuckin' Dean?

16:09.973 --> 16:11.391
His vibe is what is needed.

16:11.475 --> 16:12.559
I mean, he's the greatest.

16:12.642 --> 16:13.727
And she deserves the greatest.

16:13.810 --> 16:14.770
Yeah, she does.

16:14.853 --> 16:16.897
Okay, so you two keep doin'
what you're doin'.

16:16.980 --> 16:20.067
Three songs in two weeks.
Yeah? Hits.

16:20.150 --> 16:21.651
-Not songs, hits.
-Hits.

16:21.735 --> 16:23.612
-Undeniable.
-Undeniable.

16:23.695 --> 16:25.447
-Nothing less.
-Nothing less.

16:25.530 --> 16:27.282
Yeah, I know you're
having a good time here,

16:27.365 --> 16:29.159
but can you fuckin' focus with this guy?

16:29.242 --> 16:30.285
Yes.

16:30.368 --> 16:33.872
'Cause I gotta tell you,
nobody fuckin' believes in you right now.

16:33.955 --> 16:35.957
-Come on.
-No, no, no. She has to know the truth.

16:36.041 --> 16:37.709
-You gotta know what the stakes are.
-Okay, but you don't

16:37.793 --> 16:39.127
-have to freak her out like that.
-Yeah, no.

16:39.211 --> 16:41.838
-It's too much pressure.
-Join the freak-out club, okay?

16:41.922 --> 16:43.465
I'm freaked out, she's freaked out.

16:43.548 --> 16:45.926
If you had any sense,
you would be fuckin' freaked out

16:46.009 --> 16:47.719
because it's do or die, all right?

16:47.803 --> 16:50.305
-It is. He's not lying.
-No fucking room to fail here.

16:50.388 --> 16:51.848
I mean, use it as motivation,

16:51.932 --> 16:54.518
but that's what's happening.

16:55.852 --> 16:57.229
And you got Mike Dean comin' here?

16:58.396 --> 17:01.566
Well, then what the fuck you wasting time
talking to me? Get to work.

17:01.650 --> 17:03.902
-Come on.
-I got you.

17:03.985 --> 17:05.362
Three massive hits.

17:06.071 --> 17:07.739
I'll deal with Nikki. Just try not

17:07.823 --> 17:09.116
to end my fuckin' career, okay?

17:09.199 --> 17:10.575
I will do my very best.

17:10.659 --> 17:11.535
Or yours either.

17:13.662 --> 17:15.664
-Bye, Dee.
-Bye, sweetie.

17:16.790 --> 17:18.250
I fuckin' love that guy.

17:21.378 --> 17:22.337
He's amazing.

17:27.968 --> 17:29.845
That went better than I expected.

17:30.971 --> 17:31.972
Yeah.

17:43.734 --> 17:45.402
I think our girl's in trouble.

17:46.653 --> 17:50.407
My grandmother said
you never trust a dude with a rat tail.

17:59.207 --> 18:00.041
Oh, again.

18:00.125 --> 18:02.377
Yeah. Spank me again.

18:40.707 --> 18:43.752
-Incredible. Absolutely incredible.
-Right?

18:47.881 --> 18:49.674
It was amazing.

19:08.652 --> 19:10.695
Why don't you sing about your mom?

19:10.779 --> 19:12.989
I don't know. I feel like it's, like,

19:13.865 --> 19:16.201
not something anybody
wants to hear about.

19:17.619 --> 19:20.205
And, like, that's not
what they want from me.

19:20.288 --> 19:22.249
I don't know. It kinda scares me.

19:22.332 --> 19:23.750
-No.
-Like

19:25.502 --> 19:29.631
I feel like the more you let people in,
the more reason they have not to

19:29.714 --> 19:32.175
want you anymore, you know?

19:32.259 --> 19:33.260
Okay.

19:34.761 --> 19:35.720
Yeah.

19:35.804 --> 19:38.682
But I've never really sung about anything,

19:38.765 --> 19:40.434
-like, truthful.
-Yeah.

19:40.517 --> 19:43.061
Or anything that, like,
really means anything to me.

19:44.062 --> 19:46.648
Maybe just a lyric every once in a while.
Like a secret.

19:46.731 --> 19:48.275
Nobody has to know.

19:48.358 --> 19:50.318
Yeah, you're right.
Nobody has to know.

19:51.486 --> 19:52.612
Just you and me.

20:20.223 --> 20:24.311
Was it really hard when she,
when she died?

20:24.394 --> 20:25.979
Yeah.

20:26.062 --> 20:27.063
Sorry.

20:27.522 --> 20:30.776
She was really sick for a long time, and

20:32.194 --> 20:36.239
I was holding her hand
when she closed her eyes.

20:36.323 --> 20:37.532
I'm sorry.

20:40.619 --> 20:42.621
But I feel like she's still here.

20:44.581 --> 20:46.291
It's weird.
It's like she's still in this house,

20:46.374 --> 20:47.876
like she's in all the walls,

20:48.877 --> 20:53.381
and all the windows,
and all the mirrors.

21:10.357 --> 21:12.901
I just can feel her like she's still

21:14.236 --> 21:15.654
watching me.

21:16.238 --> 21:17.322
Thank you.

21:18.448 --> 21:20.492
Look, Xander,
I brought you up here to tell you that

21:21.993 --> 21:24.788
creative direction fuckin' sucks
with Jocelyn.

21:24.871 --> 21:26.957
I don't disagree.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.418
You don't disagree?
You're the fuckin' creative director.

21:29.501 --> 21:31.128
-What do you mean you don't disagree?
-I know.

21:31.211 --> 21:34.423
What is it with this fuckin' industry?
Everybody hates what they fuckin' do.

21:34.506 --> 21:36.633
Welcome to the music business, yeah.

21:36.716 --> 21:38.718
How do you put out something you hate?

21:39.636 --> 21:41.346
I'm fuckin' forced to.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.640
-What do you mean "forced to"?
-I could have

21:43.723 --> 21:47.310
the greatest fucking idea in the world,
and often, I fucking do.

21:47.394 --> 21:50.730
And at the end of the day, it's whatever
the fucking label and Jocelyn wants.

21:50.814 --> 21:52.482
What do you think about "I'm a Freak"?

21:52.566 --> 21:54.234
-The song?
-Yeah.

21:54.317 --> 21:55.152
It's fine.

21:55.569 --> 21:57.571
-Fine?
-It's fucking middle of the road,

21:57.654 --> 21:59.614
not enough of a re-invention,

21:59.698 --> 22:03.452
fucking manufactured bad girl.

22:03.535 --> 22:04.953
When was the last

22:05.036 --> 22:08.915
truly fucking nasty, nasty, bad pop girl?

22:10.292 --> 22:12.461
All right,
let's say you had carte blanche, right?

22:12.544 --> 22:13.962
What would you do?

22:19.050 --> 22:22.345
I would take that photo
with the fucking cum on her face

22:23.430 --> 22:25.140
and I'd make it her album cover.

22:30.896 --> 22:33.064
-I fuckin' would.
-Wow, that's a great idea.

22:33.982 --> 22:35.358
You're fuckin' smart.

22:38.236 --> 22:39.571
You wanna do some coke?

22:40.906 --> 22:43.200
No. All the coke in LA has fentanyl in it.

22:46.536 --> 22:47.621
Not mine.

22:48.038 --> 22:52.250
You used to be the prototype
when I fantasized

22:52.334 --> 22:56.004
Now I fantasize 'bout fuckin' you
with open eyes

22:56.088 --> 22:57.964
Put the indica down

22:58.048 --> 22:59.966
Am I not turning you on

23:00.050 --> 23:01.927
'Cause you're turnin' me on

23:02.010 --> 23:03.845
Yeah, you're turnin' me

23:03.929 --> 23:10.936
Oh, it's hotter than the truth

23:11.561 --> 23:13.730
Ooh, take every--

23:14.314 --> 23:16.191
That's-- Nah, can we stop it?

23:16.733 --> 23:18.568
Please stop it. Please, stop, yeah.

23:18.652 --> 23:20.278
-I mean, come on, man.
-I'm not feelin' it, I'm sorry.

23:20.362 --> 23:21.738
-Why did you stop that one?
-I don't know.

23:21.822 --> 23:23.115
-I'm gonna take it back.
-Come on, man.

23:23.198 --> 23:25.033
That was so good. I was in a trance.

23:25.117 --> 23:28.120
No, no. I think it was so much better,
like, three takes ago.

23:28.203 --> 23:30.330
-Nah, you trippin'.
-What did you think?

23:32.416 --> 23:34.668
I think I just fell in love with you.

23:36.878 --> 23:39.047
Sing with me on this next one then.

23:39.131 --> 23:39.965
No.

23:40.799 --> 23:43.468
-No?
-No.

23:43.552 --> 23:47.556
If Tedros heard you say that,
you'd be in huge trouble.

23:48.181 --> 23:49.099
What?

23:49.182 --> 23:50.225
Yeah, you trippin'.

23:50.308 --> 23:52.060
Yeah, you're not allowed to say no.

23:52.144 --> 23:54.020
You're not allowed to say no?

23:54.563 --> 23:56.148
-Yeah.
-Why?

23:56.231 --> 24:00.652
Because by saying no,
you're denying yourself an experience.

24:01.945 --> 24:04.364
Yeah, but not all experiences are good.

24:04.448 --> 24:05.824
Debatable.

24:05.907 --> 24:08.785
That's a really simple way
of looking at things, Joss.

24:09.286 --> 24:10.245
What do you mean?

24:10.328 --> 24:13.665
Some of the most
terrible experiences in life

24:13.749 --> 24:16.626
can be the most valuable,
like artistically.

24:16.710 --> 24:17.711
Yeah.

24:20.172 --> 24:22.758
I don't know.
I guess, like, to a degree.

24:24.134 --> 24:25.594
Okay, Robert Plant

24:25.677 --> 24:27.971
had a son who died
when he was five years old,

24:28.054 --> 24:30.056
and he wrote "All My Love" after that,

24:30.140 --> 24:33.101
and it's one of the most
beautiful songs ever written.

24:33.185 --> 24:35.687
Yeah, but I think if Robert Plant
had a say in it,

24:35.771 --> 24:38.857
he would've chosen his son's life.

24:38.940 --> 24:41.193
And that'd be a pretty big loss
for the world.

24:41.276 --> 24:43.987
-You really believe that?
-Yes.

24:44.071 --> 24:46.573
That's really fucked up.

24:46.656 --> 24:48.325
That's, like, actually fucked up.

24:48.408 --> 24:50.077
How often do people
come up to you and tell you

24:50.160 --> 24:52.579
that your music saved their lives?

24:52.662 --> 24:54.331
-A lot.
-A lot.

24:54.414 --> 24:56.500
And do you believe them when they say it?

24:56.583 --> 24:58.210
Yes. I do.

24:59.336 --> 25:01.546
Okay.
Now imagine if you were Robert Plant.

25:02.547 --> 25:05.008
Or imagine if you had lost
someone that you loved

25:05.092 --> 25:09.304
and you'd written one of
the greatest love songs of all time.

25:10.430 --> 25:12.015
Then what?

25:12.099 --> 25:14.267
So, you think that by losing his son,

25:14.351 --> 25:18.146
he was able to write something that saved
a lot of people's lives.

25:18.230 --> 25:19.856
-Yes.
-And because of that,

25:19.940 --> 25:22.609
you'll say yes to anything
anyone asks you to do?

25:22.692 --> 25:23.693
Yes.

25:23.777 --> 25:27.197
-Yes.
-Literally, anything?

25:27.280 --> 25:28.281
Anything.

25:29.324 --> 25:30.534
Interesting.

25:32.994 --> 25:34.704
Izaak, get up and kiss Ramsey.

25:49.302 --> 25:50.387
See?

25:51.388 --> 25:52.222
Yes.

25:53.223 --> 25:55.225
Would you have done that
if Leia was in the room?

25:56.184 --> 25:58.478
Yes, that wouldn't change anything,
Jocelyn.

25:58.562 --> 26:00.772
Even if it really hurt her feelings?

26:00.856 --> 26:02.232
Yes.

26:02.315 --> 26:04.151
Feelings can shift.

26:04.234 --> 26:06.778
What you make and what you put
out into the world,

26:06.862 --> 26:08.947
that's the shit that lasts forever.

26:09.030 --> 26:10.991
Not Leia's fuckin' feelings.

26:12.284 --> 26:13.744
Would you kiss me?

26:14.035 --> 26:15.203
Would I kiss you?

26:15.287 --> 26:17.456
-That's not a good idea.
-Yeah.

26:18.248 --> 26:19.249
Why?

26:20.292 --> 26:22.586
You know Tedros would fuckin' kill me.

26:31.052 --> 26:32.345
-A little toast.
-Speech?

26:35.223 --> 26:38.226
When my Mom bought this house,
it was so big

26:38.310 --> 26:42.063
that I was always afraid
it was gonna make me feel lonelier,

26:42.147 --> 26:44.065
because it was so hard to fill up.

26:45.067 --> 26:47.652
And I know that I haven't, like,

26:47.736 --> 26:51.490
gotten to know everyone here
super well yet,

26:51.573 --> 26:53.742
but I just wanted to say,

26:53.825 --> 26:55.535
thank you for coming into my life

26:55.619 --> 27:01.249
and filling it with music,
and inspiration, and love.

27:02.667 --> 27:05.295
Yeah, it's just-- It's really meant,
like, the world to me,

27:05.378 --> 27:07.964
and I don't know if I've

27:08.048 --> 27:11.551
felt this happy in a really long time.

27:12.052 --> 27:14.846
-Joss.
-So thank you for that.

27:14.930 --> 27:17.766
And Tedros,

27:20.102 --> 27:23.647
thank you for teaching me
how to have fun again.

27:26.400 --> 27:27.818
To finding your family.

27:27.901 --> 27:29.486
To finding your family.

27:30.487 --> 27:31.822
Cheers, cheers.

27:32.864 --> 27:35.283
Cheers.

28:04.813 --> 28:06.731
So, Xander had a brilliant idea today.

28:07.232 --> 28:08.066
No.

28:08.150 --> 28:09.317
Yeah, he did.

28:09.401 --> 28:11.361
-Yes, you did.
-Tell me.

28:11.445 --> 28:14.197
No, I would like to sleep on it,
I think.

28:14.281 --> 28:16.074
-No. No sleeping on it.
-What?

28:16.158 --> 28:17.451
-Oh, come on.
-Tell it. It's brilliant.

28:17.534 --> 28:19.327
Yeah, wait, I'm so excited.

28:19.911 --> 28:22.122
-Come on.
-Okay.

28:24.583 --> 28:26.668
I was thinking and,

28:27.836 --> 28:31.715
if your lovely label
is so fucking obsessed

28:31.798 --> 28:34.009
with making you a bad girl,

28:35.177 --> 28:38.805
we should take the photo
with the cum on your face

28:40.432 --> 28:43.518
and we should make it your album cover.

28:45.145 --> 28:46.938
-Brilliant.
-That's a bar.

28:47.022 --> 28:48.106
-No.
-Brilliant. Genius.

28:48.190 --> 28:49.649
You're kidding. You're kidding?

28:49.733 --> 28:51.151
-I'm not kidding.
-No.

28:51.234 --> 28:52.611
-Absolutely not.
-Why? Literally why?

28:52.694 --> 28:53.695
Give me one reason why.

28:53.779 --> 28:55.155
Because she h--

28:55.238 --> 28:57.240
So many young girls look up to you.

28:57.324 --> 28:58.200
Oh, my God.

28:58.283 --> 28:59.826
Yeah, and they've all
probably seen the photo.

28:59.910 --> 29:02.120
They've all definitely
seen the photo, actually.

29:02.204 --> 29:05.707
Yeah, okay, but it's different if you,
like, embrace it.

29:05.791 --> 29:08.919
So, what? It's only okay if the internet,
like, uses it against me?

29:09.002 --> 29:11.963
-Preach.
-No. The internet is on your side.

29:12.047 --> 29:15.342
-No.
-Literally, every outlet.

29:15.425 --> 29:18.970
They all wrote
beautiful pieces defending you

29:19.054 --> 29:21.431
and your right to grow up
and have a sex life.

29:21.515 --> 29:24.267
There is no difference between the people
making fun of me

29:24.351 --> 29:25.977
and the people supporting me.

29:26.061 --> 29:27.521
They're all capitalizing off of it

29:27.604 --> 29:29.189
and they're just driving
more people to look it up.

29:29.272 --> 29:32.317
That's exactly why you should make it
your album cover.

29:32.401 --> 29:34.486
I don't have an album. I threw it away.

29:34.569 --> 29:36.363
Okay, fine. Your first single.

29:36.446 --> 29:37.406
I mean

29:37.989 --> 29:41.076
we could make the caption like,
"New music coming soon."

29:41.618 --> 29:42.452
That's hard.

29:42.536 --> 29:44.830
It's fire. It's fucking fire.

29:44.913 --> 29:46.456
I'm rockin' with that.

29:46.540 --> 29:47.916
I will think about it.

29:47.999 --> 29:49.167
-I will think about it.
-Just think about it.

29:49.251 --> 29:53.171
I'm not sure I wanna restart
the whole, like, jizz-rag Jocelyn hashtag.

29:53.255 --> 29:55.674
I feel like that had its moment.
I'm not sure I want--

29:55.757 --> 29:56.967
Who gives a fuck?

29:58.260 --> 30:00.095
Because it's actually humiliating

30:00.178 --> 30:02.472
and, like,
makes me feel really bad about myself.

30:03.098 --> 30:04.099
Why?

30:05.142 --> 30:08.145
Because, like, it just, like--
I wanna be--

30:08.979 --> 30:11.773
It just sucks. It actually sucks.
It does.

30:11.857 --> 30:14.526
No, what were you, what were you about
to say just now?

30:17.529 --> 30:20.741
I was gonna say, you know, I...

30:21.950 --> 30:24.244
I wanna be taken seriously.

30:25.537 --> 30:26.538
Why?

30:27.330 --> 30:28.749
Because I do.

30:29.416 --> 30:30.709
But why?

30:30.792 --> 30:34.087
Because I wanna have a career
that lasts and is meaningful

30:34.171 --> 30:36.631
and isn't like a fucking joke.

30:36.715 --> 30:39.384
And you will, Joss.
You will. Trust me.

30:39.468 --> 30:41.303
No, not if she doesn't take risks.

30:42.804 --> 30:46.391
I mean, that's easy to say if you're not
the one taking the risks.

30:46.475 --> 30:49.311
Yeah, but, Joss, this is, like,
the right risk at the right time.

30:49.394 --> 30:50.562
-You've got great people--
-There's no such thing

30:50.645 --> 30:53.064
as "the right risk at the right time."

30:53.815 --> 30:55.859
If it's risky, it's risky for a reason.

30:55.942 --> 30:57.944
No, but if it's the right risk

30:58.028 --> 31:00.530
then you, like, basically,
know how it's gonna play out.

31:00.614 --> 31:02.449
No, that's the exact opposite of a risk.

31:02.532 --> 31:06.411
That's playing it safe.
That's what everyone else does.

31:07.454 --> 31:08.663
Is that what you do?

31:09.331 --> 31:13.043
Why are you talking to me like I'm, like,
new to the music industry?

31:13.126 --> 31:14.753
I'm not. You are.

31:15.170 --> 31:16.379
True.

31:21.176 --> 31:22.886
-Don't be rude.
-I'm not being rude.

31:22.969 --> 31:26.598
It's just, like, I've been doing this
for over a decade, so.

31:27.474 --> 31:30.352
-And you're stuck.
-Yeah, I'm stuck.

31:30.435 --> 31:33.105
-I'm stuck at the moment.
-At the moment?

31:33.188 --> 31:35.398
What was the last song you wrote, Jocelyn?

31:40.320 --> 31:41.279
"Daybreak."

31:41.363 --> 31:42.948
-"Daybreak"!
-"Daybreak."

31:43.031 --> 31:45.242
-Oh, my God.
-"Daybreak" on your second album.

31:45.325 --> 31:46.785
That was my favorite song

31:46.868 --> 31:48.453
-on the album. It's so good.
-Of course, it was.

31:48.537 --> 31:51.039
Okay, what was that, like a year ago?
Year and a half?

31:51.123 --> 31:52.791
Yeah, something like that.

31:54.709 --> 31:56.086
I mean, I don't think that's,
like, a big deal.

31:56.169 --> 31:58.338
Like, I think it's gotta be
the right song.

31:58.422 --> 32:00.257
You mean the right risk.

32:01.091 --> 32:02.759
Yeah, I mean the right risk.

32:02.843 --> 32:07.556
And what I'm saying is, I think,
maybe that's why you can't write a song.

32:08.306 --> 32:11.184
Yeah, 'cause she's fucking
overthinking everything.

32:11.268 --> 32:13.937
-Exactly.
-You...

32:14.020 --> 32:17.357
of all people should know it's a bit more
fucking complicated than that.

32:18.233 --> 32:20.110
I mean, it is and it isn't.

32:20.193 --> 32:22.195
I think that what Tedros is saying
makes a lot of sense.

32:22.279 --> 32:25.949
I think you care way too fucking much
about what people think.

32:26.032 --> 32:27.784
I think if I didn't care
what people thought,

32:27.868 --> 32:28.910
I wouldn't have a career.

32:28.994 --> 32:32.789
I think if you care too much,
you won't have a career.

32:32.873 --> 32:36.126
How can you complain about making
superficial music all the time,

32:36.209 --> 32:39.171
about not being able to write anything
honest, when

32:39.254 --> 32:42.257
all you think about is what people
are gonna fucking say?

32:42.716 --> 32:47.262
You make superficial music because
you think about superficial things.

32:47.929 --> 32:49.598
I'm sorry. I don't think it's superficial

32:49.681 --> 32:51.516
to wanna make music
that connects with people.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.268
-Not at all.
-Right? Like--

32:53.351 --> 32:54.936
Why don't you just--

32:55.020 --> 32:57.522
Why don't you just be yourself, Jocelyn?

32:58.315 --> 33:01.151
Because there's nothing about me
that's relatable.

33:01.902 --> 33:03.528
You sure about that?

33:04.362 --> 33:06.907
Okay, what do you think
is relatable about me?

33:07.324 --> 33:09.785
I don't know. All the dark shit
you've been through in your life.

33:12.245 --> 33:16.208
I think the dark shit I've been through
is pretty fucking unique, too.

33:16.291 --> 33:18.126
Yeah, I would agree.

33:23.006 --> 33:26.635
Her mom was like a rare breed.

33:32.390 --> 33:33.475
How so?

33:35.143 --> 33:38.230
I don't really feel like talking about it
in front of everyone.

33:39.648 --> 33:40.732
Too late.

33:44.653 --> 33:45.862
Tedros.

33:46.738 --> 33:47.739
Please.

33:48.865 --> 33:49.741
Not now.

33:49.825 --> 33:52.661
Jocelyn, I don't keep secrets
from anyone at this table.

33:52.744 --> 33:55.330
Well, that's, that's your prerogative.

33:55.414 --> 33:57.416
I'm not gonna let you keep secrets either.

33:58.542 --> 34:02.212
I think that's a little easier to say
when you don't actually know the details.

34:02.295 --> 34:05.173
Baby, there's nothing
that you're gonna reveal to me right now

34:05.257 --> 34:07.634
that's gonna make me love you any less.

34:07.717 --> 34:10.720
I think I speak for everyone
at the table when I say that.

34:11.555 --> 34:14.141
You're safe here. I promise.

34:34.995 --> 34:36.413
She did a lot of things.

34:38.248 --> 34:40.667
A lot of things. Her...

34:41.418 --> 34:45.046
her favorite was probably
hitting me with a hairbrush.

34:46.256 --> 34:47.674
Hitting you where?

34:49.092 --> 34:50.719
My butt, my...

34:51.595 --> 34:53.305
thighs, my stomach, my back.

34:53.388 --> 34:56.099
Like, just anywhere
people wouldn't notice.

34:57.434 --> 34:59.936
-Why'd she do that?
-To focus.

35:00.729 --> 35:04.733
She did it as, like,
a form of motivation, I guess.

35:07.527 --> 35:09.154
Kinda like a dog.

35:10.530 --> 35:15.535
She'd do it to help me remember my lines,
to remember dance moves, to finish songs.

35:16.161 --> 35:18.580
She'd do it to keep me
from falling asleep

35:19.831 --> 35:22.042
to help me wake up on time.

35:23.794 --> 35:25.420
She'd do it if she caught me

35:26.588 --> 35:28.757
smoking or drinking

35:28.840 --> 35:32.177
or flirting with someone
she didn't approve of.

35:35.305 --> 35:37.766
She'd do it if I overate,
if I didn't exercise,

35:37.849 --> 35:40.393
or if she ever caught me

35:42.104 --> 35:44.106
smiling to myself.

35:50.779 --> 35:52.989
How long did this go on for?

35:53.824 --> 35:57.285
Until the chemo made her so weak
she couldn't lift up a hairbrush anymore.

35:57.953 --> 35:59.996
You didn't fight back?

36:00.080 --> 36:02.040
-No.
-Why not?

36:03.625 --> 36:06.336
Because there's just some battles
you're never gonna win.

36:13.009 --> 36:14.219
That's so sad.

36:16.763 --> 36:19.349
-And no one said anything?
-Nope.

36:25.814 --> 36:27.023
What about you?

36:29.943 --> 36:32.070
I don't know what we could've done.

36:32.779 --> 36:34.322
You sure about that?

36:37.075 --> 36:39.494
I did the best that I could at the time.

36:40.287 --> 36:41.747
-Really?
-Yeah.

36:43.707 --> 36:45.208
How hard did she hit you, Jocelyn?

36:46.960 --> 36:49.004
Hard enough to break skin.

36:49.087 --> 36:50.547
Jesus Christ.

36:54.843 --> 36:56.845
And you felt like Xander
was there for you?

37:01.433 --> 37:03.852
In a lot of ways, yeah.

37:03.935 --> 37:07.522
So, I'm guessing no one said anything
because you're getting paid?

37:07.606 --> 37:09.483
Okay, that fucking wasn't it.

37:09.566 --> 37:10.609
-No?
-No.

37:10.692 --> 37:12.110
What do you think?

37:15.030 --> 37:17.657
I think it was just such a horrible,
fucked-up situation

37:17.741 --> 37:20.744
that no one really knew what
the right thing to do was.

37:26.249 --> 37:28.126
Is there a part of you that wonders

37:28.210 --> 37:32.047
if the reason you're stuck is because
your mother's not around?

37:40.639 --> 37:42.349
Yeah, absolutely.

37:44.017 --> 37:46.645
So, you, you miss it?

37:48.021 --> 37:49.147
Getting hit?

37:50.857 --> 37:52.401
The motivation it gave you.

38:00.659 --> 38:02.077
Sometimes.

38:06.832 --> 38:09.251
If you loved the music you were making

38:10.961 --> 38:12.754
would you have felt like it was worth it?

38:25.976 --> 38:27.185
Yeah.

38:43.368 --> 38:45.579
Leia, you look tired.

38:45.662 --> 38:48.081
Izaak, you should take her to bed.

38:50.333 --> 38:52.252
Yeah, all right.

38:55.756 --> 38:56.757
Come on.

38:57.549 --> 38:58.633
It's okay.

39:17.235 --> 39:18.445
Hey,

39:18.987 --> 39:23.200
all that trauma,
you're gonna turn into inspiration.

39:24.534 --> 39:26.369
You're gonna tap into it.

39:27.412 --> 39:29.247
You're gonna feel it.

39:29.664 --> 39:31.500
You're gonna face it.

39:31.833 --> 39:33.668
You're gonna remember it.

39:34.711 --> 39:37.339
And you're gonna let it wash all over.

39:42.219 --> 39:44.304
You still got that hairbrush?

39:45.347 --> 39:46.348
Yeah.

39:47.724 --> 39:49.142
Go get it.

39:56.817 --> 39:57.818
Okay.

40:30.976 --> 40:34.187
Mmm, mm-mm

40:35.772 --> 40:38.358
I've been manipulated a hundred times

40:38.442 --> 40:43.989
But none of them
felt so soft and kind and

40:44.072 --> 40:47.993
Hell is a place for what we tried but

40:48.076 --> 40:51.163
It never felt so wrong in my mind and

40:52.080 --> 40:55.292
Never understood why Mama cried

40:56.084 --> 40:59.504
Could it be because our secret time

41:00.130 --> 41:04.009
I always thought
someday you'd find us but

41:04.092 --> 41:07.971
Waiting for you is like slowly dying

41:09.097 --> 41:11.391
'Cause you kept me warm

41:11.475 --> 41:17.230
You held me close until you let me go

41:17.314 --> 41:19.483
Now my blood is cold

41:19.566 --> 41:24.780
I never had the time to let you know

41:24.863 --> 41:28.867
Take me back, take me back

41:28.950 --> 41:32.204
Take me back

41:33.038 --> 41:37.000
Take me back, take me back

41:37.084 --> 41:41.046
Take me back

41:41.129 --> 41:44.758
All of me, take all of me

41:45.258 --> 41:49.137
All of me, all of me

41:49.221 --> 41:53.308
Take me back, take me back

41:53.391 --> 41:57.270
Take me back

41:57.354 --> 42:00.565
Where do we go from here

42:01.274 --> 42:05.445
Hold my heart and set me free

42:05.529 --> 42:09.449
Where do we go from here

42:09.533 --> 42:13.370
Kiss me with each melody

42:13.453 --> 42:17.457
You're someone I used to fear

42:17.541 --> 42:21.545
Because I loved your forbidden touch

42:21.628 --> 42:25.632
The thought of you cut so deep

42:25.715 --> 42:30.387
So, I'll open up my scar

42:30.470 --> 42:34.683
'Cause you keep me warm,
just hold me close

42:34.766 --> 42:38.311
I'll never let you go

42:38.395 --> 42:40.772
'Cause now my blood is cold

42:40.856 --> 42:46.069
I'm waitin' for the day
you call my phone

42:46.153 --> 42:50.157
Take me back, take me back

42:50.240 --> 42:53.326
Take me back

42:53.410 --> 42:54.745
This is really gonna hurt.

42:54.828 --> 42:56.371
Take me back

42:56.455 --> 43:00.625
But if you push through the pain,
it'll be beautiful.

43:02.461 --> 43:06.465
All of me, take all of me

43:06.548 --> 43:10.510
All of me, all of me

43:10.594 --> 43:14.556
Take me back, take me back

43:14.639 --> 43:17.976
Take me back

44:05.857 --> 44:07.734
Thank you for taking care of me.

44:42.936 --> 44:45.856
Where do we go from here?

44:50.944 --> 44:53.739
Where do we go from here?

44:59.202 --> 45:02.247
Where do we go from here?

45:03.165 --> 45:07.002
Hold my heart and set me free

45:07.502 --> 45:10.380
Where do we go from here?

45:11.381 --> 45:14.926
Kiss me with each melody

45:15.427 --> 45:18.346
Where do we go from here?

45:19.431 --> 45:23.101
Kiss me with each melody
