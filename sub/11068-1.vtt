00:26.884 --> 00:30.665
<i>They say Japan was made
by a sword.</i>

00:31.890 --> 00:35.810
<i>They say the old gods dipped
a coral blade into the ocean...</i>

00:35.811 --> 00:40.611
<i>... and when they pulled it out, four
perfect drops fell back into the sea...</i>

00:40.774 --> 00:44.846
<i>... and those drops became
the islands of Japan.</i>

00:45.946 --> 00:50.746
<i>I say Japan was made
by a handful of brave men...</i>

00:52.118 --> 00:54.578
<i>... warriors willing to give their lives...</i>

00:54.579 --> 00:57.771
<i>... for what seems to have become
a forgotten word:</i>

00:58.625 --> 01:00.192
<i>Honor.</i>

01:55.015 --> 01:58.893
Ladies and gentlemen:
Winchester.

01:58.894 --> 02:01.685
America's leader in all forms
of armament used...

02:01.686 --> 02:03.420
...by the United States Army...

02:03.421 --> 02:08.221
...celebrates our nation's centennial
by bringing you a true American hero.

02:09.852 --> 02:13.913
One of the most decorated warriors
this country has ever known.

02:13.914 --> 02:16.875
Winner of the Medal of Honor
for his gallantry...

02:16.876 --> 02:19.330
...on the hallowed ground
of Gettysburg.

02:19.331 --> 02:20.789
San Francisco, 1876

02:20.790 --> 02:23.792
He is late of the 7th Cavalry...

02:23.793 --> 02:28.129
...and their triumphant campaign against
the most savage of the lndian nations.

02:28.130 --> 02:32.930
Ladies and gentlemen,
l present to you:

02:32.968 --> 02:36.214
Captain Nathan Algren!

02:42.852 --> 02:47.652
Captain Nathan Algren!

02:47.815 --> 02:49.315
Yes!

02:49.316 --> 02:50.828
Yes!

02:52.152 --> 02:55.147
One moment,
ladies and gentlemen.

02:57.449 --> 02:59.908
Goddamn you, Algren,
get out there!

02:59.909 --> 03:04.709
This is your last performance!
You're fired! Now get out there!

03:05.706 --> 03:08.458
Come on! l'm sick of this!

03:08.459 --> 03:09.969
Come on!

03:11.045 --> 03:12.555
Yes!

03:19.928 --> 03:23.958
My thanks, Mr. McCabe,
you are too kind.

03:25.182 --> 03:28.184
This, ladies and gents...

03:28.185 --> 03:31.437
...is the gun that's winning the West.

03:31.438 --> 03:35.175
Why, many's the time
l've found myself...

03:36.610 --> 03:40.444
...surrounded by a swarm of...

03:41.948 --> 03:44.241
...angry hostiles...

03:44.242 --> 03:47.077
...with nothing but this rifle...

03:47.078 --> 03:51.878
...between me and a certain
and gruesome death.

03:52.416 --> 03:55.705
And let me tell you, folks,
the red man...

03:56.044 --> 03:58.587
...is a fearsome enemy.

03:58.588 --> 04:00.547
And if he'd had his way...

04:00.548 --> 04:04.050
...why, this scalp of mine
would be long gone...

04:04.051 --> 04:08.279
...and there'd be a balder man
standing before you today.

04:13.226 --> 04:16.613
Like those poor bastards out there...

04:16.813 --> 04:19.262
...on the Little Vighorn.

04:20.942 --> 04:23.545
Vodies stripped bare...

04:24.487 --> 04:26.544
...mutilated.

04:27.698 --> 04:30.399
Left to rot in the sun.

04:33.870 --> 04:38.670
This, ladies and gentlemen,
the 73 lever-action...

04:38.917 --> 04:40.876
...Trapper.

04:40.960 --> 04:45.760
lt's got a seven-shot capacity. Accurate
400 yards, one round per second.

04:45.965 --> 04:49.050
Son, have you ever seen
what this could do to a man?

04:49.051 --> 04:52.094
This would blow a hole
in your daddy six inches wide.

04:52.095 --> 04:53.663
That's right, missy.

04:54.097 --> 04:55.639
This beauty.

04:55.640 --> 05:00.310
You could kill yourself five, six, seven
braves without ever having to reload.

05:00.311 --> 05:04.874
Note the patented loading port
and the smooth cocking action.

05:20.246 --> 05:24.332
My thanks on behalf
of those who died...

05:24.333 --> 05:28.461
...in the name of better
mechanical amusements...

05:28.462 --> 05:30.813
...and commercial opportunities.

05:31.465 --> 05:34.467
Mr. McCabe here will take your orders.

05:34.468 --> 05:37.014
God bless you all.

05:44.310 --> 05:47.812
l must say, captain, you have a flair
for the old melodrama.

05:47.813 --> 05:51.691
- You're alive.
- l am, indeed.

05:51.692 --> 05:55.569
Your man Custer says to me,
''We're going to the Little Vighorn. ''

05:55.570 --> 05:59.156
Says l, ''What's this 'we' stuff?''
lt's the walking ticket for me.

05:59.157 --> 06:02.117
Nine lives l have.
Vut l'll tell you what else l have.

06:02.118 --> 06:04.285
l have a good job for the both of us.

06:04.286 --> 06:07.121
God knows it looks
as if you'll need one real soon.

06:07.122 --> 06:09.332
What kind of a job?

06:09.333 --> 06:14.133
The only job you're fit for, boyo.
A man's job.

06:15.422 --> 06:19.845
Unless, of course, you got your heart
set on a career in the theater.

06:23.304 --> 06:25.054
Nathan!

06:25.055 --> 06:27.515
Just listen to what
your man has to say.

06:27.516 --> 06:29.868
Veen a while.
lt's good to see you.

06:30.102 --> 06:32.812
l'd like you to meet
Mr. Omura from Japan...

06:32.813 --> 06:36.815
...and his associate, whose name
l've given up trying to pronounce.

06:36.816 --> 06:38.328
Sit down, please.

06:43.906 --> 06:45.416
Whiskey.

06:45.658 --> 06:50.458
Now, Japan's got it in mind
to become a civilized country.

06:50.996 --> 06:54.039
And Mr. Omura here is willing
to spend what it takes...

06:54.040 --> 06:56.875
...to hire white experts
to train their army.

06:56.876 --> 06:59.044
And if we play our cards right...

06:59.045 --> 07:03.314
...the Emperor grants the U. S.
exclusive rights to supply arms.

07:09.054 --> 07:12.723
Well, l have an agreement
with Winchester Company.

07:12.724 --> 07:16.226
l'm certain Mr. Omura has some concept
of what an agreement is.

07:16.227 --> 07:21.027
Your performances for the Winchester
Company bring you $25 a week.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.923
We will pay you $400 a month.

07:29.406 --> 07:32.442
Five. For each.

07:32.701 --> 07:37.361
And another 500
when we get the job done.

07:37.497 --> 07:42.297
How many other genuine heroes
you got lined up?

07:43.252 --> 07:45.086
He's rude.

07:45.087 --> 07:48.798
That's how it is here.
A land of cheap traders.

07:48.799 --> 07:50.257
Whiskey.

07:50.258 --> 07:53.594
So who will we be training
your boys to fight?

07:53.595 --> 07:58.395
His name is Katsumoto Moritsugu.
He was once the Emperor's teacher.

07:58.766 --> 08:01.393
- He's Samurai.
- Samurai?

08:01.394 --> 08:03.895
The word you might use is ''warrior. ''

08:03.896 --> 08:07.648
Mr. Omura is familiar with our
experiences dealing with renegades.

08:07.649 --> 08:09.734
ls he?

08:09.735 --> 08:11.569
He's even read your book.

08:11.570 --> 08:13.862
Captain Algren's study of the tribes...

08:13.863 --> 08:17.306
...was a crucial factor
in our defeat of the Cheyenne.

08:30.170 --> 08:33.164
Please excuse. What is funny?

08:34.841 --> 08:39.640
The corps back together again.
lt's just so...

08:40.136 --> 08:43.131
...inspiring!

08:47.728 --> 08:49.644
Excuse me.

08:52.315 --> 08:55.351
l need to use the necessities.

08:58.362 --> 09:01.656
This isn't a problem.
l'll just talk to him for a minute.

09:01.657 --> 09:03.324
Colonel Vagley.

09:03.325 --> 09:07.119
We contacted you because you are
Captain Algren's superior officer...

09:07.120 --> 09:09.705
...and you assured us
of his participation.

09:09.706 --> 09:13.541
He'll do it.
l just need a minute.

09:15.503 --> 09:17.126
Nathan.

09:18.798 --> 09:22.175
l did what l was ordered
to do out there.

09:22.176 --> 09:23.996
And l have no remorse.

09:25.346 --> 09:28.186
So, what do you say we
put the past behind us?

09:31.560 --> 09:34.978
You want me to kill Jappos,
l'll kill them.

09:34.979 --> 09:38.190
- l'm not asking you to kill anybody.
- You want me to kill their enemies...

09:38.191 --> 09:40.011
...l'll kill their enemies.

09:40.359 --> 09:43.778
Rebs or Sioux or Cheyenne...

09:43.779 --> 09:47.823
For 500 bucks a month,
l'll kill whoever you want.

09:47.824 --> 09:50.231
Vut keep one thing in mind...

09:51.411 --> 09:54.798
...l'd happily kill you for free.

10:09.970 --> 10:12.846
<i>July 12th, 1876.</i>

10:12.847 --> 10:15.884
<i>There is some comfort
in the emptiness of the sea.</i>

10:16.559 --> 10:20.688
<i>No past, no future.</i>

10:22.148 --> 10:26.948
<i>And then at once, I am confronted by
the hard truth of present circumstances.</i>

10:29.613 --> 10:34.413
<i>I have been hired to help suppress
the rebellion of yet another tribal leader.</i>

10:34.784 --> 10:39.207
<i>Apparently, this is the only job
for which I am suited.</i>

10:40.873 --> 10:45.492
<i>I am beset by the ironies of my life.</i>

11:18.074 --> 11:21.950
Yokohama Harbor, 1876

11:54.982 --> 11:57.525
- Captain Algren, l presume?
- Yes.

11:57.526 --> 12:00.278
Jolly good. How do you do?
Simon Graham.

12:00.279 --> 12:03.823
Twenty years ago,
this was a sleepy little town.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.324
Now look at it.

12:05.325 --> 12:08.702
You see, the Emperor is mad
for all things Western...

12:08.703 --> 12:11.914
...and the Samurai believe
it's changing too fast.

12:11.915 --> 12:15.167
The ancient and the modern
are at war for the soul of Japan.

12:15.168 --> 12:18.336
So your new employer, Mr. Omura,
is bringing in...

12:18.337 --> 12:20.713
...every Western expert he can get.

12:20.714 --> 12:24.800
Lawyers from France, engineers from
Germany, architects from Holland...

12:24.801 --> 12:28.387
...and now, of course,
warriors from America.

12:28.388 --> 12:33.141
l came over with the Vritish
trade mission, oh, years ago.

12:33.142 --> 12:35.185
l was soon relieved of my position.

12:35.186 --> 12:37.937
l had an unfortunate tendency
to tell the truth...

12:37.938 --> 12:40.899
...in a country where no one ever
says what they mean.

12:40.900 --> 12:45.700
So now, l very accurately translate
other people's lies.

12:50.533 --> 12:53.910
For 2000 years, no emperor
was even seen by a commoner.

12:53.911 --> 12:58.665
You have to realize what an honor this
is. lt's all highly ritualized, of course.

12:58.666 --> 13:01.709
You may look at him,
but do not speak unless spoken to.

13:01.710 --> 13:05.880
lf he stands, you must bow.
lf he bows, you must bow lower.

13:05.881 --> 13:09.463
Do l look presentable?
l haven't worn this in a decade.

13:09.926 --> 13:12.670
Rather snug around the midriff.

13:27.526 --> 13:29.583
And bow.

13:30.570 --> 13:33.655
The divine Emperor Meiji
bids you welcome.

13:33.656 --> 13:37.491
He is grateful for the assistance
your country offers.

13:37.576 --> 13:40.328
We hope to accomplish
the same national harmony...

13:40.329 --> 13:43.169
...you enjoy in your homeland.

13:50.422 --> 13:53.673
The Emperor is most interested
in your American lndians...

13:53.674 --> 13:56.259
...if you have fought
against them in battle.

13:56.260 --> 13:59.942
We have, Your Highness.
The red man is a brutal adversary.

14:07.729 --> 14:10.230
The Emperor wishes
to ask Captain Algren...

14:10.231 --> 14:13.108
...if it is true they wear eagle feathers...

14:13.109 --> 14:16.319
...and paint their faces
before going into battle...

14:16.320 --> 14:18.923
...and that they have no fear.

14:21.617 --> 14:23.772
They are very brave.

14:32.043 --> 14:33.806
Vow.

14:41.468 --> 14:45.793
Thank you very much.

14:56.065 --> 14:59.354
And step back.

15:00.069 --> 15:04.869
Step back, step back and turn.

15:07.534 --> 15:10.118
Right, you little bastards!

15:10.119 --> 15:13.955
You will stand up straight
or l will personally shit-kick...

15:13.956 --> 15:18.085
...every Far Eastern buttock
that appears before my eyes!

15:19.753 --> 15:21.504
Well done, sergeant.

15:21.505 --> 15:25.049
When you understand the language,
everything falls into place.

15:25.050 --> 15:28.199
The first rank will kneel,
rifles at the ready.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.470
The second rank...

15:30.471 --> 15:34.012
<i>July 22nd, 1876.</i>

15:34.308 --> 15:39.062
<i>For six months ' work, I am to receive
three years of captain 's pay...</i>

15:39.063 --> 15:42.156
<i>... teaching Orientals to soldier.</i>

15:43.817 --> 15:46.068
<i>They are an army of conscripts.</i>

15:46.069 --> 15:49.238
<i>Most of them are peasants
who have never even seen a gun.</i>

15:49.239 --> 15:51.155
Fire!

15:52.283 --> 15:55.702
<i>They are led by General Hasegawa,
a man of small stature...</i>

15:55.703 --> 15:58.663
<i>... who nonetheless commands
enormous respect.</i>

15:58.664 --> 16:03.380
What can the general tell me about
this man, this Samurai, Katsumoto?

16:07.797 --> 16:11.425
<i>He seems to have great knowledge
of Katsumoto and his rebellion.</i>

16:11.426 --> 16:14.135
<i>I will count on his help
when facing the Samurai.</i>

16:14.136 --> 16:16.292
Who supplies their weapons?

16:23.895 --> 16:28.262
Katsumoto no longer dishonors himself
by using firearms, you see.

16:28.316 --> 16:29.942
He uses no firearms?

16:29.943 --> 16:33.385
To those who honor the old ways,
Katsumoto is a hero.

16:33.404 --> 16:34.946
How well does he know him?

16:34.947 --> 16:38.366
The general and Katsumoto
fought together for the Emperor.

16:38.367 --> 16:40.032
He fought with the Samurai?

16:42.412 --> 16:43.924
He is Samurai.

16:50.461 --> 16:53.630
You must understand.
Katsumoto pledged his sword...

16:53.631 --> 16:55.090
...to defend the Emperor.

16:55.091 --> 16:57.884
They say that a Samurai's sword
is his soul.

16:57.885 --> 16:59.761
Samurai are paradoxical.

16:59.762 --> 17:02.888
l've tried to write about them,
but they keep to themselves.

17:02.889 --> 17:05.598
The bastards are still wearing armor.

17:05.599 --> 17:08.935
When the lrish were comporting
themselves in loincloths...

17:08.936 --> 17:12.314
...these chaps were the most
sophisticated warriors on Earth.

17:12.315 --> 17:14.648
l need information
on their battle tactics.

17:14.650 --> 17:17.944
l have several more books
just waiting to be translated.

17:17.944 --> 17:20.279
He'll be speaking the lingo in no time.

17:20.280 --> 17:22.531
You should hear him blather on
in Vlackfoot.

17:22.531 --> 17:24.200
Really?

17:24.201 --> 17:27.161
A fellow linguist? Oh, capital!

17:27.162 --> 17:30.580
Come on, sir.
A word or two in the savage tongue.

17:30.581 --> 17:34.292
Just ''hello'' or ''goodbye'' or...
No, no, no!

17:34.293 --> 17:37.191
''Cut his tongue out
and boil him in oil. ''

17:39.131 --> 17:41.465
Early day tomorrow, captain.

17:41.466 --> 17:45.469
- lt's about bedtime, isn't it?
- l always had a fascination with scalping.

17:45.470 --> 17:48.815
l never quite understood
its technique.

17:53.436 --> 17:58.147
lmagine someone who hates you
with the utmost intensity...

17:58.148 --> 18:02.948
...grabbing a handful of your hair while
you're lying prostrate and helpless...

18:08.783 --> 18:12.577
...and scraping a dull blade
of a rusty knife around your scalp...

18:12.578 --> 18:15.279
...with a saw-like motion.

18:15.664 --> 18:20.464
And let your imagination grasp, if you
can, the effect of a strong, quick jerk...

18:22.004 --> 18:25.506
...on the turf of your hair
to release any clinging particles...

18:25.507 --> 18:28.753
...would have on your nervous system.

18:32.305 --> 18:36.349
And you'll have some idea
of how it feels to be scalped...

18:36.350 --> 18:39.247
...Mr. Graham.

18:44.399 --> 18:46.849
How soon can you
translate those books?

18:48.861 --> 18:51.017
Right away.

18:52.657 --> 18:56.451
l'm just delighted you're taking
such an interest in Samurai.

18:56.452 --> 19:00.037
l don't give a damn about the Samurai.
l want to know my enemy.

19:00.038 --> 19:04.069
l shall not sleep until it is done.

19:06.044 --> 19:08.003
Sake.

19:08.379 --> 19:10.535
l bid you good night.

19:11.257 --> 19:12.716
Can l get you anything?

19:12.717 --> 19:14.926
<i>This is a punitive expedition, captain.</i>

19:14.927 --> 19:18.262
Col. Vagley, these people had
nothing to do with the raids!

19:18.263 --> 19:21.357
- Good night, sir.
- Quietly now, boys.

20:06.641 --> 20:08.055
Fire!

20:17.401 --> 20:20.861
We should be grateful they're all firing
in the same direction.

20:20.862 --> 20:23.508
Couldn't have put it better myself, sir.

20:26.910 --> 20:30.395
Rifle butt, against the shoulder.

20:31.622 --> 20:34.415
Eye, down the sight.

20:34.416 --> 20:36.236
Now, slowly...

20:40.964 --> 20:42.727
Well done.

20:43.758 --> 20:45.620
Nathan!

20:49.263 --> 20:52.640
Katsumoto's attacked a railroad
at the border of his province.

20:52.641 --> 20:55.977
We cannot govern a country
in which we cannot travel freely.

20:55.978 --> 20:57.437
He must be stopped now.

20:57.438 --> 21:01.232
My railroad is a priority
for this country.

21:01.233 --> 21:02.691
They're not ready.

21:02.692 --> 21:06.695
The rebels don't have any rifles.
They're savages with bows and arrows.

21:06.696 --> 21:10.490
Whose sole occupation for the last
thousand years has been war.

21:10.491 --> 21:14.914
You have superior firepower
and a larger force.

21:14.995 --> 21:18.122
l am ordering the regiment
to move against Katsumoto.

21:18.123 --> 21:22.056
You will track him down
and engage him.

21:25.004 --> 21:26.463
Load.

21:26.464 --> 21:30.008
Mr. Graham!
Tell this man to fire at me!

21:30.009 --> 21:33.678
- l beg your pardon?
- Tell this man...

21:33.679 --> 21:37.850
...if he does not shoot me,
l will kill him!

21:38.225 --> 21:42.101
- Captain, if l might have a word.
- Tell him!

21:43.063 --> 21:44.979
Tell him!

21:50.736 --> 21:52.654
Load!

21:56.283 --> 21:58.340
Load!

22:01.121 --> 22:02.535
Faster!

22:03.623 --> 22:05.133
Faster!

22:09.712 --> 22:12.258
Shoot me, damn it.

22:16.301 --> 22:18.359
Fire!

22:20.013 --> 22:21.523
Fire!

22:47.872 --> 22:49.382
They're not ready.

22:52.084 --> 22:55.023
The regiment leaves at 6 a. m.!

23:25.656 --> 23:29.743
A thousand miles of rail track laid
in less than two years.

23:29.744 --> 23:31.578
lt's astonishing.

23:31.579 --> 23:33.830
And Omura owns all of it?

23:33.831 --> 23:36.999
As soon as he can get rid
of the Samurai, he will, yes.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.710
How do you intend
to find Katsumoto?

23:39.711 --> 23:44.511
Don't worry, Mr. Graham.
l assure you, he'll find us.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.726
Move into position!

23:56.727 --> 23:58.185
Yoshino Province, 1876

23:58.186 --> 24:00.687
1 st Company,
form a battle line on me!

24:00.688 --> 24:02.856
Pay attention,
it will save your life!

24:02.857 --> 24:05.650
2nd Company,
form on 1 st Company.

24:05.651 --> 24:08.153
3rd and 4th Company,
form up behind.

24:08.154 --> 24:09.863
Fill in on command!

24:09.864 --> 24:14.385
- Where's Hasegawa?
- He refuses to fight against Katsumoto.

24:16.745 --> 24:18.998
- Cover down!
- Captain Algren.

24:19.956 --> 24:21.498
We are not here as combatants.

24:21.499 --> 24:24.293
- Then who's gonna lead them?
- Their own officers.

24:24.294 --> 24:27.379
- Let's move to the rear.
- We'll be there presently.

24:27.380 --> 24:29.044
Fix bayonets!

24:33.052 --> 24:37.852
- Mr. Graham, accompany me to the rear.
- Yes, of course.

24:42.018 --> 24:46.818
Sergeant Gant, report to the rear and see
to the disposition of the supply trains.

24:47.607 --> 24:50.358
- Did you hear my order?
- l did indeed, sir!

24:50.359 --> 24:52.860
Then you will obey it. Now!

24:52.861 --> 24:56.836
No disrespect intended, sir,
but shove it up your ass.

25:01.619 --> 25:04.655
- Load!
- Load!

25:31.980 --> 25:33.492
Samurai come.

25:35.233 --> 25:36.745
You'll be fine, son.

25:54.668 --> 25:57.618
- Assume firing positions!
- Assume firing positions!

26:10.724 --> 26:13.565
Fire on my order only!

26:34.913 --> 26:36.536
Hold your fire!

26:37.457 --> 26:39.277
Hold your fire!

26:45.423 --> 26:47.339
Reload!

26:51.428 --> 26:53.387
Hold the line!

26:54.806 --> 26:56.921
Fire at will!

27:12.739 --> 27:14.404
Lieutenant, fall back!

27:57.530 --> 27:59.195
Zeb!

29:39.207 --> 29:41.460
He's mine.

30:08.275 --> 30:09.940
Stop!

30:17.325 --> 30:19.382
Take him away!

32:26.068 --> 32:27.691
What is your name?

32:29.780 --> 32:31.837
lnsolent swine! Answer!

32:44.335 --> 32:46.686
Leave him be.

32:55.386 --> 32:57.346
This is my son's village.

32:57.347 --> 33:01.713
We are deep in the mountains and
winter is coming. You cannot escape.

33:04.186 --> 33:06.299
Jolly good.

35:09.551 --> 35:12.511
My Lord, why do you spare
the barbarian?

35:12.512 --> 35:15.256
He is shamed in defeat.

35:15.807 --> 35:17.599
He should kill himself.

35:17.600 --> 35:20.300
That is not their custom.

35:24.398 --> 35:26.120
Then...

35:26.400 --> 35:28.414
...l will kill him.

35:28.527 --> 35:30.094
Father...

35:30.111 --> 35:32.126
l don't think...

35:34.282 --> 35:35.947
Ujio...

35:36.034 --> 35:39.202
...there will be plenty of killing to come.

35:39.203 --> 35:40.745
For now...

35:40.746 --> 35:43.873
...we will learn about our new enemy.

35:43.874 --> 35:46.226
Keep him alive.

35:54.551 --> 35:56.271
He's in bad shape.

35:57.470 --> 35:58.980
Sake.

36:00.431 --> 36:02.223
Sake?

36:02.224 --> 36:04.827
Sake.

36:11.816 --> 36:13.326
Sake.

36:13.359 --> 36:15.360
Taka will take care of you.

36:15.361 --> 36:17.181
Sake.

37:16.876 --> 37:18.737
Sake.

37:21.213 --> 37:22.422
Sake!

37:22.423 --> 37:25.516
Let him drink, Aunt.

37:25.550 --> 37:27.176
No. That will not do.

37:27.177 --> 37:28.594
This is my village.

37:28.595 --> 37:31.100
This is my house.

37:35.518 --> 37:37.183
Please.

37:37.353 --> 37:39.116
Sake.

37:48.488 --> 37:51.385
Sake!

37:57.413 --> 38:00.758
No!

38:01.416 --> 38:03.866
No!

38:07.464 --> 38:10.906
l told you!

38:17.306 --> 38:20.105
No!

39:03.390 --> 39:05.055
Morning.

40:55.909 --> 40:57.926
Over there!

40:57.953 --> 41:01.102
Go. You, go.

41:02.082 --> 41:04.041
What's your name?

41:04.292 --> 41:06.545
You got a name, don't you?

41:10.214 --> 41:13.013
You don't know what l'm saying,
do you?

41:13.968 --> 41:15.731
l know why you don't talk.

41:16.804 --> 41:18.638
You're angry.

41:18.639 --> 41:22.221
You're angry because
they make you wear a dress.

41:23.226 --> 41:24.738
Son of a bitch.

42:03.805 --> 42:08.130
This temple was built by my family
a thousand years ago.

42:09.852 --> 42:12.646
My name is Katsumoto.

42:12.647 --> 42:15.992
What is your name?

42:21.446 --> 42:24.791
Are my words not correct?

42:28.828 --> 42:32.215
l will practice my English with you...

42:33.165 --> 42:35.376
...if you would honor me.

42:36.835 --> 42:39.383
You kept me alive just to speak English?

42:41.173 --> 42:43.328
Then what do you want?

42:44.300 --> 42:45.812
To know my enemy.

42:47.136 --> 42:50.180
l've seen what you do to your enemies.

42:50.181 --> 42:52.348
Warriors in your country do not kill?

42:52.349 --> 42:56.184
They don't cut the heads off defeated,
kneeling men.

42:56.645 --> 43:01.011
General Hasegawa asked me
to help him end his life.

43:01.858 --> 43:05.833
A Samurai cannot stand
the shame of defeat.

43:05.987 --> 43:08.590
l was honored to cut off his head.

43:11.242 --> 43:16.042
Many of our customs seem strange
to you. The same is true of yours.

43:16.247 --> 43:17.955
For example...

43:17.956 --> 43:22.756
...not to introduce yourself is considered
extremely rude, even among enemies.

43:29.717 --> 43:31.830
Nathan Algren.

43:34.054 --> 43:36.853
l am honored to meet you.

43:37.057 --> 43:41.143
- l enjoyed this conversation in English.
- l have questions.

43:41.144 --> 43:44.980
l have introduced myself.
You have introduced yourself.

43:44.981 --> 43:47.486
This is a very good conversation.

43:47.817 --> 43:49.859
- l have questions.
- They come later.

43:49.860 --> 43:52.659
Who was the warrior in the red armor?

43:53.239 --> 43:57.199
- My brother-in-law, Hirotaro.
- And the woman who cares for me?

43:57.200 --> 44:00.077
My sister, Hirotaro's wife.

44:00.078 --> 44:01.940
Her name is Taka.

44:01.955 --> 44:03.465
l killed her husband?

44:05.166 --> 44:07.769
lt was a good death.

44:20.347 --> 44:21.806
You!

44:21.807 --> 44:26.607
You! Come... Please...

44:55.420 --> 44:56.932
Thank you.

45:05.054 --> 45:09.349
He smells like the pigs.
Tell my brother l cannot stand this.

45:09.350 --> 45:10.860
Why don't you tell him?

45:10.893 --> 45:13.202
At least make him take a bath.

46:19.331 --> 46:21.444
Nicely done.

46:23.960 --> 46:26.586
They may be children,
but they are strong.

46:26.587 --> 46:28.099
You try.

46:28.881 --> 46:30.546
Try.

47:10.753 --> 47:12.263
Put down the sword.

49:39.556 --> 49:44.142
l just realized, l've been remiss.
Forgive me.

49:44.143 --> 49:47.895
l have yet to thank you
for looking out for me yesterday.

49:47.896 --> 49:50.500
That is your job, correct?

49:50.566 --> 49:52.525
Protecting me?

49:53.360 --> 49:55.570
Well done, Vob.

49:55.737 --> 49:58.481
You don't mind if l call you ''Vob, ''
do you?

49:58.698 --> 50:03.414
l knew a Vob once.
God, he was ugly as a mule.

50:03.661 --> 50:05.970
You a ladies' man, Vob?

50:09.583 --> 50:14.105
Ujio is teaching you the way
of the Japanese sword.

50:15.088 --> 50:17.146
Yes, indeed.

50:18.716 --> 50:23.083
You fought against your Red lndians?

50:27.099 --> 50:28.558
Yes.

50:28.559 --> 50:30.476
Tell me of your part in this war.

50:30.477 --> 50:32.228
- Why?
- l wish to learn.

50:32.229 --> 50:35.731
- Read a book.
- l would rather have a good conversation.

50:35.732 --> 50:37.942
- Why?
- Vecause...

50:37.943 --> 50:40.153
...we are both students of war.

50:47.326 --> 50:48.949
So...

50:49.954 --> 50:52.948
...you were the general of your army?

50:54.916 --> 50:56.638
No.

50:57.586 --> 51:00.420
l was a captain.

51:00.421 --> 51:02.828
This is a low rank?

51:04.800 --> 51:06.956
A middle rank.

51:07.887 --> 51:09.454
And who was your general?

51:14.351 --> 51:16.935
Don't you have a rebellion to lead?

51:16.936 --> 51:20.439
People in your country
do not like conversation?

51:20.440 --> 51:23.280
He was a lieutenant colonel.

51:23.526 --> 51:25.402
His name was Custer.

51:25.403 --> 51:26.913
l know this name.

51:27.237 --> 51:29.322
He killed many warriors.

51:29.323 --> 51:31.157
Oh, yes. Many warriors.

51:31.158 --> 51:33.492
So he was a good general.

51:33.493 --> 51:37.287
No. No, he wasn't a good general.
He was arrogant and foolhardy.

51:37.288 --> 51:42.083
He got massacred because he took
a battalion against 2000 angry lndians.

51:42.084 --> 51:44.919
Two thousand lndians?

51:44.920 --> 51:46.432
How many men for Custer?

51:46.630 --> 51:48.295
Two hundred and eleven.

51:49.508 --> 51:51.817
l like this General Custer.

51:52.010 --> 51:56.222
He was a murderer who fell in love
with his own legend.

51:56.223 --> 51:58.515
And his troopers died for it.

51:58.516 --> 52:00.767
l think this is a very good death.

52:00.768 --> 52:02.978
Maybe you can have one
like it someday.

52:02.979 --> 52:05.484
lf it is in my destiny.

52:06.023 --> 52:09.605
- What do you want from me?
- What do you want for yourself?

52:11.695 --> 52:13.279
What are you doing?

52:13.280 --> 52:15.785
Why are we having these conversations?

52:16.157 --> 52:18.956
What the hell am l doing here?

52:23.706 --> 52:25.457
ln spring...

52:25.458 --> 52:29.488
...the snows will melt
and the passes will open.

52:30.712 --> 52:33.861
Until that time, you are here.

52:35.216 --> 52:38.463
Good day, captain.

52:58.988 --> 53:00.989
<i>1876.</i>

53:00.990 --> 53:04.770
<i>Day unknown. Month unknown.</i>

53:05.244 --> 53:09.569
<i>I continue to live among
these unusual people.</i>

53:10.165 --> 53:13.945
<i>I am their captive,
in that I cannot escape.</i>

53:15.336 --> 53:18.528
<i>Mostly, I'm treated with
a kind of a mild neglect...</i>

53:18.965 --> 53:23.765
<i>... as if I were a stray dog
or an unwelcome guest.</i>

53:35.188 --> 53:38.924
<i>Everyone is polite.
Everyone smiles and bows.</i>

53:40.109 --> 53:44.909
<i>But beneath their courtesy,
I detect a deep reservoir of feeling.</i>

54:25.276 --> 54:27.333
<i>They are an intriguing people.</i>

54:27.361 --> 54:29.320
<i>From the moment they wake...</i>

54:29.321 --> 54:34.037
<i>... they devote themselves to
the perfection of whatever they pursue.</i>

54:41.874 --> 54:45.360
<i>I have never seen such discipline.</i>

54:45.919 --> 54:50.214
<i>I am surprised to learn that the word
''Samurai'' means ''to serve''...</i>

54:50.215 --> 54:52.883
<i>... and that Katsumoto believes
his rebellion to be...</i>

54:52.884 --> 54:55.137
<i>... in the service of the Emperor.</i>

56:56.622 --> 56:59.773
Please forgive. Too many mind.

57:00.709 --> 57:02.824
Too many mind?

57:03.045 --> 57:07.845
Mind sword, mind people watch,
mind enemy.

57:08.175 --> 57:10.288
Too many mind.

57:11.928 --> 57:13.438
No mind.

57:15.223 --> 57:17.084
No mind.

57:46.043 --> 57:49.583
Thank you. More rice?

57:50.714 --> 57:54.647
Taka. He spoke Japanese!

57:55.051 --> 57:58.512
Eat a lot. Don't be polite.

57:58.513 --> 58:01.311
Not so fast. What are these?

58:05.519 --> 58:07.925
How can he understand?

58:11.066 --> 58:12.886
Top knot.

58:16.862 --> 58:18.486
No, no. Not so fast.

58:22.409 --> 58:23.919
l'm Algren.

58:31.459 --> 58:34.804
- Nobutada.
- Nobutada.

58:35.004 --> 58:37.089
- Magojiro.
- Magojiro.

58:37.090 --> 58:38.600
Higen.

58:39.008 --> 58:40.631
Higen.

58:43.971 --> 58:45.538
Taka.

58:48.516 --> 58:52.394
Vrother, please make him leave.
l cannot stand it.

58:52.395 --> 58:54.396
ls he so repulsive?

58:54.397 --> 58:57.774
The shame is unbearable.
l ask permission to end my life.

58:57.775 --> 59:00.475
You will do as you are told!

59:06.116 --> 59:09.243
You'd rather l kill him
to avenge your husband?

59:09.244 --> 59:11.160
Yes.

59:14.457 --> 59:17.876
Hirotaro tried to kill the American.
lt was karma.

59:17.877 --> 59:19.793
l know.

59:23.548 --> 59:25.410
Forgive my weakness.

59:25.759 --> 59:30.420
There must be some reason
why he is here.

59:32.348 --> 59:35.988
lt is beyond my understanding.

59:54.452 --> 59:56.858
She's been very kind to me.

59:57.455 --> 01:00:02.171
She's honored to have
my guest in her house.

01:00:25.897 --> 01:00:28.858
<i>Winter, 1877.</i>

01:00:28.859 --> 01:00:31.666
<i>What does it mean to be Samurai?</i>

01:00:31.667 --> 01:00:35.717
<i>To devote yourself utterly
to a set of moral principles...</i>

01:00:35.858 --> 01:00:39.261
<i>... to seek a stillness of your mind...</i>

01:00:39.378 --> 01:00:42.814
<i>... and to master the way of the sword.</i>

01:00:42.815 --> 01:00:44.741
He's getting better, no?

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:48.853
But still so ugly.

01:00:57.170 --> 01:00:58.793
Cold?

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:11.963
Also. Also cold.

01:01:12.758 --> 01:01:14.324
Fire.

01:01:22.677 --> 01:01:24.537
To burn.

01:01:42.641 --> 01:01:44.507
No, please.

01:01:46.111 --> 01:01:49.330
Japanese men do not help with this.

01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:53.217
l am not Japanese.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.754
l'm sorry.

01:02:34.111 --> 01:02:37.563
For your husband, Hirotaro.

01:02:49.916 --> 01:02:54.716
He did his duty.

01:02:58.382 --> 01:03:03.042
You did your duty.

01:03:07.432 --> 01:03:10.525
l accept your apology...

01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:32.621
<i>Spring, 1877.</i>

01:03:32.622 --> 01:03:37.422
<i>This marks the longest I have stayed
in one place since I left the farm at 17.</i>

01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:45.022
<i>There is so much here
that I'll never understand.</i>

01:03:48.804 --> 01:03:51.765
<i>I have never been a church-going man...</i>

01:03:51.766 --> 01:03:54.226
<i>... and what I've seen
on the field of battle...</i>

01:03:54.227 --> 01:03:56.353
<i>... has led me to question God's purpose.</i>

01:03:56.354 --> 01:03:58.897
<i>But there is, indeed, something...</i>

01:03:58.898 --> 01:04:02.480
<i>... spiritual in this place.</i>

01:04:05.237 --> 01:04:08.864
<i>And though it may forever
be obscure to me...</i>

01:04:08.865 --> 01:04:12.937
<i>... I cannot but be aware of its power.</i>

01:04:20.793 --> 01:04:25.593
<i>I do know it is here that I have known
my first untroubled sleep in many years.</i>

01:04:29.093 --> 01:04:32.220
No, you gotta get the ball!
Go and get it.

01:04:32.221 --> 01:04:37.021
No, not me!
You gotta get the ball! The ball!

01:04:44.732 --> 01:04:47.477
Ujio will win in three moves.

01:04:49.821 --> 01:04:51.584
ln five!

01:05:05.794 --> 01:05:07.516
Next in five moves.

01:05:09.298 --> 01:05:10.808
ln six.

01:05:29.692 --> 01:05:31.651
No mind.

01:06:37.423 --> 01:06:38.933
A draw!

01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:24.202
Who is this amateur?

01:08:26.901 --> 01:08:28.566
Katsumoto!

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.895
Protect Katsumoto!
Protect our Lord!

01:09:13.404 --> 01:09:15.068
Lord, please go inside!

01:11:55.349 --> 01:11:58.810
The perfect blossom is a rare thing.

01:11:58.811 --> 01:12:03.611
You could spend your life looking for
one, and it would not be a wasted life.

01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:06.818
Who sent those men to kill you?

01:12:06.819 --> 01:12:10.403
l'm writing a poem about a dream l had.

01:12:10.404 --> 01:12:13.449
<i>The tiger's eyes are like my own</i>

01:12:13.450 --> 01:12:17.228
<i>But he comes from across
A deep and troubled sea</i>

01:12:17.579 --> 01:12:19.734
Was it the Emperor?

01:12:21.249 --> 01:12:22.707
Omura?

01:12:22.708 --> 01:12:27.327
lf the Emperor wishes my death,
he has but to ask.

01:12:27.547 --> 01:12:29.701
So it was Omura.

01:12:29.965 --> 01:12:32.299
l'm having trouble finishing the poem.

01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:36.220
- Can you suggest a last line?
- l'm not a writer.

01:12:36.221 --> 01:12:41.021
Yet you have written many pages
since you came here.

01:12:43.686 --> 01:12:46.232
What else has she told you?

01:12:47.732 --> 01:12:50.139
You have nightmares.

01:12:52.612 --> 01:12:54.321
Every soldier has nightmares.

01:12:54.322 --> 01:12:58.393
Only one who is ashamed
of what he has done.

01:12:58.533 --> 01:13:02.314
You have no idea what l have done.

01:13:09.003 --> 01:13:12.739
You have seen many things.

01:13:12.964 --> 01:13:14.423
l have.

01:13:14.424 --> 01:13:19.178
And you do not fear death,
but sometimes you wish for it.

01:13:19.179 --> 01:13:21.584
ls this not so?

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:26.802
- Yes.
- l, also.

01:13:27.269 --> 01:13:31.857
lt happens to men who have seen
what we have seen.

01:13:31.858 --> 01:13:36.658
And then l come to this place
of my ancestors...

01:13:37.612 --> 01:13:39.780
...and l remember.

01:13:39.781 --> 01:13:42.525
Like these blossoms...

01:13:42.826 --> 01:13:45.232
...we are all dying.

01:13:46.747 --> 01:13:50.818
To know life in every breath...

01:13:50.958 --> 01:13:53.334
...every cup of tea...

01:13:53.335 --> 01:13:56.547
...every life we take.

01:13:56.548 --> 01:13:59.091
The way of the warrior.

01:13:59.092 --> 01:14:01.694
Life in every breath.

01:14:02.387 --> 01:14:05.030
That is Vushido.

01:14:08.933 --> 01:14:13.205
The Emperor has granted
a safe passage to Tokyo.

01:14:13.229 --> 01:14:15.637
We leave tomorrow.

01:14:18.152 --> 01:14:19.816
Good.

01:14:20.653 --> 01:14:22.221
Good.

01:14:28.578 --> 01:14:32.064
When l took these, you were...

01:14:32.414 --> 01:14:34.276
...my enemy.

01:14:54.144 --> 01:14:56.550
Excuse me.

01:14:57.772 --> 01:15:01.550
No, so sorry, l am finishing.

01:15:18.876 --> 01:15:21.086
l must go away.

01:15:42.732 --> 01:15:46.314
You have been kind to me.

01:15:49.028 --> 01:15:50.946
l won't forget...

01:16:17.473 --> 01:16:21.797
Algren-san! Algren-san.

01:19:15.392 --> 01:19:17.226
Algren?

01:19:17.227 --> 01:19:20.669
Algren, my God, you are alive.

01:19:24.233 --> 01:19:27.130
Well, you never cease to astonish.

01:19:27.403 --> 01:19:31.322
- Howitzers.
- Yes, indeed.

01:19:31.323 --> 01:19:34.283
As soon as the Emperor signs
the trade agreement...

01:19:34.284 --> 01:19:36.536
...he gets the whole package.

01:19:36.537 --> 01:19:40.498
lncluding this particular item.
Two hundred rounds a minute.

01:19:40.499 --> 01:19:43.875
And the new cartridges
cut down on jamming.

01:19:43.876 --> 01:19:45.794
l need a bath.

01:19:45.795 --> 01:19:50.022
After living with those savages,
l can only imagine.

01:19:50.924 --> 01:19:53.528
Welcome back, captain.

01:20:03.017 --> 01:20:05.310
You rise against me, my teacher.

01:20:05.311 --> 01:20:08.729
No, Highness.
l rise against your enemies.

01:20:08.730 --> 01:20:12.858
They are my advisors, like you.

01:20:12.859 --> 01:20:16.247
They advise in their own interest.

01:20:16.612 --> 01:20:21.412
l need advisors who know
the modern world.

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:26.960
lf l am no use,
l will happily end my life.

01:20:28.332 --> 01:20:30.095
No...

01:20:30.459 --> 01:20:33.586
l need your voice in the council.

01:20:33.587 --> 01:20:36.133
lt is your voice we need, Highness.

01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:40.134
You are a living god.
Do what you think is right.

01:20:40.135 --> 01:20:43.228
l am a living god...

01:20:44.264 --> 01:20:48.491
...as long as l do
what they think is right.

01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:51.604
What sad words you speak.

01:20:51.605 --> 01:20:55.243
Forgive me for saying
what a teacher must.

01:20:56.359 --> 01:20:58.612
Have you forgotten your people?

01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:02.695
Tell me what to do...

01:21:04.866 --> 01:21:06.379
...my teacher.

01:21:11.081 --> 01:21:14.232
You are Emperor, my Lord, not me.

01:21:15.043 --> 01:21:19.816
You must find the wisdom for all of us.

01:21:24.094 --> 01:21:27.089
Gentlemen, come in.

01:21:27.137 --> 01:21:30.515
Captain Algren, it seems
you have endured your captivity...

01:21:30.516 --> 01:21:32.049
...with little ill effect.

01:21:32.769 --> 01:21:34.478
l was not ill-treated, sir.

01:21:34.479 --> 01:21:38.272
Mr. Omura, l have here
a draft of the arms agreement.

01:21:38.273 --> 01:21:42.234
l'm eager to know how many Samurai
have joined Katsumoto.

01:21:42.235 --> 01:21:43.819
l'm afraid l don't know.

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:47.365
- You spent the winter at his encampment.
- As his prisoner.

01:21:47.366 --> 01:21:51.785
Has he fortified his position?
Acquired firearms? Tell us what you saw.

01:21:51.786 --> 01:21:56.586
As you said, colonel,
they're savages with bows and arrows.

01:21:57.291 --> 01:22:01.419
- Sir, about the...
- l'm sure your documents are in order.

01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:06.008
Thank you. Leave them on my desk.
l'll address them at the appropriate time.

01:22:06.009 --> 01:22:10.552
With all due respect, sir,
our president's patience is wearing thin.

01:22:10.553 --> 01:22:13.264
Perhaps there is someone else
we should speak to.

01:22:13.265 --> 01:22:15.808
With all due respect, ambassador...

01:22:15.809 --> 01:22:18.686
...perhaps there is someone else
we should speak to.

01:22:18.687 --> 01:22:21.647
For instance, the French
or the English.

01:22:21.648 --> 01:22:25.330
Or any of the legations
waiting in the next room.

01:22:26.486 --> 01:22:30.363
We should be looking forward
to hearing from you.

01:22:30.531 --> 01:22:34.659
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Captain Algren.

01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:39.460
Perhaps you and l might have
a word in private. Please, sit down.

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:46.435
- May l offer you whiskey?
- No, thank you.

01:22:52.136 --> 01:22:55.471
Katsumoto is an extraordinary man,
is he not?

01:22:55.472 --> 01:22:59.350
He's a tribal leader.
l've known many of them.

01:22:59.351 --> 01:23:04.151
Vut none who are Samurai.
Their ways have great appeal.

01:23:04.481 --> 01:23:08.525
- l don't see how this concerns me.
- Vut it does.

01:23:08.526 --> 01:23:13.326
You see, you were right. Last year,
we were not prepared to go to battle.

01:23:13.947 --> 01:23:16.741
You were right,
and Colonel Vagley was wrong.

01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:18.867
Vut now, we are ready.

01:23:18.868 --> 01:23:22.455
lf Katsumoto is allowed to attract
other Samurai to his cause...

01:23:22.456 --> 01:23:27.256
...we will have 10 years of rebellion.
This is something l will not allow.

01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:32.260
Either l'll stop him at the council today,
or you'll lead my army against him.

01:23:33.216 --> 01:23:38.016
And with these new weapons,
you will crush him.

01:23:39.137 --> 01:23:43.308
- l appreciate the offer.
- lt is not an offer.

01:23:43.433 --> 01:23:47.687
Mr. Omura, my contract with you
was to train your army.

01:23:47.688 --> 01:23:50.356
Then we will make a new contract...

01:23:50.357 --> 01:23:53.943
...one that will recognize
the extraordinary contribution...

01:23:53.944 --> 01:23:55.860
...you've made to the Emperor.

01:23:56.071 --> 01:23:58.771
Do we understand each other?

01:24:00.909 --> 01:24:05.570
- Yes, we understand each other perfectly.
- Then l am pleased.

01:24:12.503 --> 01:24:17.303
Follow him. lf he goes anywhere
near Katsumoto, kill him.

01:24:23.012 --> 01:24:26.015
Captain Algren!
What in heaven's name is going on?

01:24:26.016 --> 01:24:28.184
The diplomatic community is abuzz.

01:24:28.185 --> 01:24:31.103
Omura has passed laws
against the Samurai.

01:24:31.104 --> 01:24:32.562
l need a drink.

01:24:32.563 --> 01:24:37.109
ls your friend Katsumoto planning to go
up against the council this afternoon?

01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:41.910
You, Samurai!
Don't you know about the order?

01:24:43.992 --> 01:24:45.460
My God, it's started.

01:24:45.617 --> 01:24:48.319
Hey boy, are you listening?

01:24:49.204 --> 01:24:51.288
No wonder the foreigners mock you.

01:24:51.289 --> 01:24:52.957
Let's give this Samurai a haircut.

01:24:52.958 --> 01:24:54.582
Cut off his top knot.

01:24:54.710 --> 01:24:56.168
Get down! Kneel!

01:24:56.169 --> 01:24:57.377
Captain Algren!

01:24:57.378 --> 01:24:58.596
Lower your weapons!

01:24:59.338 --> 01:25:01.257
Lower your weapons!

01:25:02.342 --> 01:25:03.675
Who are you?

01:25:03.676 --> 01:25:05.243
l am Captain Algren.

01:25:07.389 --> 01:25:09.151
Stop!

01:25:33.038 --> 01:25:34.703
Get down!

01:25:49.637 --> 01:25:51.750
Let's go.

01:26:07.904 --> 01:26:10.354
l'll take you home.

01:26:11.073 --> 01:26:13.033
Jolly good.

01:26:39.768 --> 01:26:41.976
We must resist the Western powers...

01:26:41.977 --> 01:26:44.092
...by becoming powerful ourselves.

01:26:44.563 --> 01:26:49.086
Our army, our economy,
must be strong.

01:26:51.904 --> 01:26:55.838
Minister, you honor us.

01:26:57.743 --> 01:27:00.738
lt is my honor to rejoin this council.

01:27:04.583 --> 01:27:08.085
Perhaps you are unaware of the law
against wearing swords?

01:27:08.086 --> 01:27:10.296
l read every law carefully.

01:27:10.297 --> 01:27:14.369
Yet you bring weapons
into this chamber?

01:27:17.177 --> 01:27:20.888
This chamber was protected
by my sword when...

01:27:20.889 --> 01:27:24.433
We need no protection.
We are a nation of laws.

01:27:24.434 --> 01:27:27.312
We are a nation of whores,
selling ourselves...

01:27:27.313 --> 01:27:32.113
lf we are whores,
the Samurai made us this way.

01:27:32.401 --> 01:27:37.201
l have not seen the Omura family
giving gold to the masses.

01:27:40.241 --> 01:27:43.629
Minister Katsumoto,
it is with great regret...

01:27:44.203 --> 01:27:47.102
...but l must ask you
to remove your sword.

01:27:51.169 --> 01:27:53.253
This sword serves the Emperor.

01:27:53.254 --> 01:27:56.291
Only he can command me to remove it.

01:28:18.444 --> 01:28:23.244
The Emperor's voice is too pure
to be heard in this council.

01:28:24.576 --> 01:28:28.802
Then, l must refuse
to give up my sword.

01:28:33.751 --> 01:28:37.377
Then regretfully, my guards will
accompany you to your home in Tokyo.

01:28:37.378 --> 01:28:40.570
There you will await our summons.

01:29:04.238 --> 01:29:06.590
l heard you were leaving.

01:29:08.033 --> 01:29:11.617
Omura offers you my job,
and you run away.

01:29:12.161 --> 01:29:14.765
l suppose l should thank you.

01:29:14.914 --> 01:29:19.714
$500 a month, including
back pay for time spent...

01:29:19.878 --> 01:29:22.034
...in captivity.

01:29:23.297 --> 01:29:27.230
Enough to climb back inside a bottle
for the rest of your life.

01:29:30.054 --> 01:29:31.774
You're welcome.

01:29:36.686 --> 01:29:39.395
Well, it is pretty much over.

01:29:39.396 --> 01:29:43.942
Katsumoto's under arrest.
Omura won't let him last the night.

01:29:43.943 --> 01:29:48.488
With him dead, we should have
little trouble handling the rebellion...

01:29:48.489 --> 01:29:50.546
...even without you.

01:29:54.577 --> 01:29:57.322
Especially without you.

01:30:01.875 --> 01:30:04.479
Just tell me one thing.

01:30:04.753 --> 01:30:09.553
What is it about your own people
that you hate so much?

01:31:01.433 --> 01:31:04.177
Save us the trouble...

01:33:53.803 --> 01:33:56.547
The Samurai are finished!

01:34:21.831 --> 01:34:23.289
Stop!

01:34:23.290 --> 01:34:24.708
Don't come any closer!

01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:27.544
Don't stop.
Whatever you do, don't stop.

01:34:27.545 --> 01:34:32.345
Minister Omura has commanded us
to photograph the traitor...

01:34:32.841 --> 01:34:34.604
Stop! Somebody!

01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:36.384
Vring that equipment here now!

01:34:36.385 --> 01:34:37.928
lmmediately!

01:34:37.929 --> 01:34:39.888
You stop!

01:34:39.889 --> 01:34:44.689
You insolent, useless son
of a peasant dog!

01:34:45.937 --> 01:34:50.565
How dare you show your sword in
his presence! Do you know who this is?

01:34:50.566 --> 01:34:54.360
This is the President
of the United States of America!

01:34:54.361 --> 01:34:58.615
He is here to lead our armies
in victorious battle against the rebels!

01:34:58.616 --> 01:35:00.657
lt's not my responsibility...

01:35:00.658 --> 01:35:04.984
Now get over there and
help those men with their equipment!

01:35:07.665 --> 01:35:09.429
Carry the equipment.

01:35:12.921 --> 01:35:16.215
- President of the United States?
- Sorry.

01:35:16.216 --> 01:35:18.329
l think l'm going to be sick.

01:35:36.234 --> 01:35:38.641
How's your poem coming?

01:35:40.905 --> 01:35:43.949
The end is proving difficult.

01:35:43.950 --> 01:35:48.611
This is Mr. Simon Graham. He'd like
very much to take your photograph.

01:35:49.414 --> 01:35:51.747
l thought you returned to America.

01:35:51.748 --> 01:35:56.548
l decided to stay.
See if l could convince you to escape.

01:35:56.671 --> 01:35:59.176
How do you plan to do that?

01:36:07.598 --> 01:36:11.767
Mr. Graham, perhaps you would care
to take pictures of my village.

01:36:11.768 --> 01:36:14.371
l would be greatly honored.

01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:36.836
My Lord, no!

01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:38.959
Nobutada!

01:38:23.727 --> 01:38:27.071
Father, let me stay.

01:38:30.607 --> 01:38:32.666
lt is my time.

01:38:45.705 --> 01:38:47.329
My Lord...

01:38:47.790 --> 01:38:50.001
...we must go.

01:40:12.497 --> 01:40:15.882
The Emperor could not hear my words.

01:40:17.709 --> 01:40:20.650
His army will come.

01:40:21.505 --> 01:40:23.758
lt is the end.

01:40:25.883 --> 01:40:30.683
For 900 years, my ancestors
have protected our people.

01:40:32.098 --> 01:40:34.515
Now...

01:40:34.516 --> 01:40:36.533
...l have failed them.

01:40:47.779 --> 01:40:51.811
So you will take your own life...

01:40:52.743 --> 01:40:54.252
...in shame?

01:40:59.207 --> 01:41:03.532
Shame for a life of service?

01:41:03.878 --> 01:41:07.167
Discipline? Compassion?

01:41:07.464 --> 01:41:11.093
The way of the Samurai
is not necessary anymore.

01:41:11.094 --> 01:41:13.990
Necessary?

01:41:15.555 --> 01:41:18.496
What could be more necessary?

01:41:22.104 --> 01:41:26.331
l will die by the sword.

01:41:27.401 --> 01:41:29.985
My own...

01:41:29.986 --> 01:41:32.142
...or my enemy's.

01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:35.493
Then let it be your enemy's.

01:41:38.744 --> 01:41:43.209
Together, we will make
the Emperor hear you.

01:42:10.274 --> 01:42:14.740
He was a good man.

01:42:17.406 --> 01:42:19.740
Will you fight the white men, too?

01:42:19.741 --> 01:42:24.541
lf they come here, yes.

01:42:27.165 --> 01:42:28.831
Why?

01:42:31.337 --> 01:42:36.137
Vecause they come to destroy
what l have come to love.

01:42:50.021 --> 01:42:54.821
The way of Samurai is difficult
for children. He misses his father.

01:42:59.571 --> 01:43:04.371
And he is angry
because l am the cause of that.

01:43:12.250 --> 01:43:17.050
No. He is angry because
he fears you will die as well.

01:43:39.066 --> 01:43:43.866
My father taught me
it is glorious to die in battle.

01:43:48.409 --> 01:43:53.209
That is what he believed.

01:43:58.210 --> 01:44:00.616
l would be afraid to die in battle.

01:44:01.964 --> 01:44:03.684
So would l.

01:44:05.633 --> 01:44:08.572
Vut you have been in many battles.

01:44:10.097 --> 01:44:13.735
And l was always afraid.

01:44:20.898 --> 01:44:22.465
l don't want you to go.

01:44:23.734 --> 01:44:25.777
Algren.

01:44:25.778 --> 01:44:27.290
They are coming.

01:44:56.391 --> 01:44:58.642
l'd say two full regiments.

01:44:58.643 --> 01:45:01.342
They'll come in waves of a thousand.

01:45:01.479 --> 01:45:03.270
And they have the howitzers.

01:45:03.271 --> 01:45:07.692
lt makes no difference. They will come,
and we will make our stand.

01:45:07.693 --> 01:45:11.274
- How many men will we have?
- Maybe 500.

01:45:11.321 --> 01:45:13.436
Like General Custer, huh?

01:45:17.452 --> 01:45:21.621
There was once a battle
at a place called Thermopylae.

01:45:21.622 --> 01:45:25.375
Three hundred brave Greeks held off
a Persian army of a million men.

01:45:25.376 --> 01:45:28.128
A million. You understand this number?

01:45:28.129 --> 01:45:30.380
l understand this number.

01:45:30.381 --> 01:45:33.133
For two days the Greeks
made them pay so dearly...

01:45:33.134 --> 01:45:37.934
...the Persian army lost all taste
for battle and were defeated soon after.

01:45:38.639 --> 01:45:43.016
- What do you have in mind?
- Take away the advantage of their guns.

01:45:43.017 --> 01:45:47.147
They're overconfident. We'll use that.
Lure them close.

01:45:47.689 --> 01:45:49.550
Close enough for a sword.

01:45:50.983 --> 01:45:53.444
You believe...

01:45:53.445 --> 01:45:55.894
...a man can change his destiny?

01:45:58.491 --> 01:46:01.826
l think a man does what he can...

01:46:01.827 --> 01:46:04.333
...until his destiny is revealed to him.

01:46:11.337 --> 01:46:15.172
<i>May 25th, 1877.</i>

01:46:15.173 --> 01:46:18.509
<i>This will be the last entry
in this journal.</i>

01:46:18.510 --> 01:46:23.310
<i>I've tried to give a true accounting
of what I have seen, what I have done.</i>

01:46:23.890 --> 01:46:27.810
<i>I do not presume to understand
the course of my life.</i>

01:46:27.811 --> 01:46:32.021
<i>I know I am grateful
to have partaken of all this...</i>

01:46:32.022 --> 01:46:34.429
<i>... even if for a moment.</i>

01:48:26.255 --> 01:48:31.055
Algren-san, will you come with me?

01:48:48.068 --> 01:48:52.238
lf you wear this armor,
it will honor us.

01:51:49.907 --> 01:51:53.294
You will need this.

01:52:04.630 --> 01:52:06.139
What does it say?

01:52:07.007 --> 01:52:11.807
''l belong to the warrior in whom
the old ways have joined the new. ''

01:53:16.531 --> 01:53:19.525
Good God.

01:53:22.578 --> 01:53:27.082
Sir, the lmperial Army of Japan
demands your surrender.

01:53:27.083 --> 01:53:30.000
lf you lay down your arms,
you will not be harmed.

01:53:30.001 --> 01:53:34.801
This is not possible,
as Mr. Omura knows.

01:53:38.718 --> 01:53:40.803
Captain Algren.

01:53:40.804 --> 01:53:42.888
We will show you no quarter.

01:53:42.889 --> 01:53:46.040
You ride against us,
and you are the same as them.

01:53:46.559 --> 01:53:48.966
l'll look for you on the field.

01:54:09.373 --> 01:54:10.999
Captain Algren.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:14.093
Mr. Graham.

01:54:16.921 --> 01:54:20.465
Perhaps you can use these
for your book.

01:54:20.466 --> 01:54:23.306
Yes, l will. Captain.

01:54:26.055 --> 01:54:28.113
Godspeed.

01:54:29.433 --> 01:54:32.232
Mr. Graham.

01:54:55.666 --> 01:54:59.053
Well they won't surrender.

01:55:04.050 --> 01:55:07.535
Are we ready?

01:55:08.888 --> 01:55:10.509
Get into your positions!

01:55:54.681 --> 01:55:57.968
Commence firing!

01:57:13.338 --> 01:57:16.090
- They're covering their retreat.
- You see?

01:57:16.091 --> 01:57:20.010
Even the mighty Samurai
cannot stand up to the howitzers.

01:57:20.011 --> 01:57:23.389
- Signal the attack.
- l advise sending in skirmishers first.

01:57:23.390 --> 01:57:25.742
Nonsense! Full attack!

01:58:21.111 --> 01:58:23.755
They're coming.

01:58:55.728 --> 01:58:57.938
Wait for the volley.

01:59:09.407 --> 01:59:11.563
Second volley.

02:00:06.003 --> 02:00:08.702
- What on earth?
- What is happening?

02:00:53.089 --> 02:00:57.021
- The attack has been stopped.
- Send in the rest of the regiment.

02:01:01.388 --> 02:01:04.056
What happened to the warriors
at Thermopylae?

02:01:04.057 --> 02:01:07.346
Dead to the last man.

02:02:09.911 --> 02:02:11.969
Algren-san!

02:05:00.157 --> 02:05:03.502
Son of a bitch thinks he can win.

02:06:07.219 --> 02:06:11.306
They'll bring two more regiments
up here soon.

02:06:11.307 --> 02:06:13.714
We won't be able to stop them again.

02:06:14.351 --> 02:06:16.802
You do not have to die here.

02:06:19.482 --> 02:06:22.728
l should have died
so many times before.

02:06:22.777 --> 02:06:24.441
Now, you live again.

02:06:27.448 --> 02:06:30.051
Yes.

02:06:31.826 --> 02:06:35.313
lt was not your time.

02:06:38.165 --> 02:06:40.866
lt's not over.

02:07:26.754 --> 02:07:28.338
What is this?

02:07:28.339 --> 02:07:30.159
Cannon, prepare to fire!

02:07:30.257 --> 02:07:32.019
Prepare to fire!

02:07:32.425 --> 02:07:37.225
- This is madness. He's going to attack?
- Yes.

02:07:45.062 --> 02:07:48.644
He's defeated!
He must accept his shame!

02:08:00.077 --> 02:08:02.661
Kill him. All of them.

02:08:02.662 --> 02:08:05.502
Now!

02:08:09.127 --> 02:08:10.694
My horse!

02:09:03.387 --> 02:09:04.897
Fire!

02:09:41.673 --> 02:09:43.241
Ready!

02:09:46.386 --> 02:09:47.898
Aim!

02:09:53.016 --> 02:09:54.585
Fire!

02:10:00.525 --> 02:10:02.288
Fire at will!

02:10:48.195 --> 02:10:50.504
Vring up the new guns!

02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:52.502
Prepare the new guns!

02:10:57.203 --> 02:10:59.358
Fire!

02:11:01.082 --> 02:11:02.649
Vackward!

02:11:05.419 --> 02:11:07.965
Quickly! Quickly!

02:11:11.090 --> 02:11:12.952
Fire!

02:12:57.275 --> 02:12:58.939
Stop firing!

02:12:59.026 --> 02:13:01.027
ldiots, keep on firing!

02:13:01.028 --> 02:13:02.988
Stop firing! Stop!

02:13:12.372 --> 02:13:14.095
No.

02:13:15.209 --> 02:13:19.380
Shoot! Kill Katsumoto!
Kill the American!

02:13:20.922 --> 02:13:24.168
You have your honor again.

02:13:25.886 --> 02:13:28.532
Let me die with mine.

02:13:37.564 --> 02:13:39.915
Help me up.

02:13:59.167 --> 02:14:01.181
Are you ready?

02:14:08.008 --> 02:14:12.334
l will miss our conversations.

02:14:58.223 --> 02:15:00.968
Perfect.

02:15:07.149 --> 02:15:10.929
They are all...

02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:13.866
...perfect.

02:16:41.570 --> 02:16:45.895
<i>On behalf of the United States
of America...</i>

02:16:46.159 --> 02:16:50.959
...the signing of this treaty will usher in
an era of unprecedented prosperity...

02:16:51.581 --> 02:16:56.040
...and cooperation between
our two great nations.

02:16:56.041 --> 02:16:57.919
On behalf of the Emperor...

02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:02.385
...we are pleased to have
successfully concluded this...

02:17:05.093 --> 02:17:07.793
...negotiation.

02:17:15.020 --> 02:17:17.075
He is here?

02:18:21.207 --> 02:18:24.593
Highness, if we could just conclude
the matter at hand...

02:18:51.570 --> 02:18:54.915
This is Katsumoto's sword.

02:18:55.739 --> 02:18:58.931
He would have wanted you to have it...

02:18:59.618 --> 02:19:03.258
...that the strength of the Samurai
be with you always.

02:19:03.580 --> 02:19:08.379
Enlightened One,
we all weep for Katsumoto, but...

02:19:08.753 --> 02:19:10.614
He hoped...

02:19:10.962 --> 02:19:13.548
...with his last breath...

02:19:13.549 --> 02:19:17.522
...that you would remember the
ancestors who held this sword...

02:19:18.719 --> 02:19:21.421
...and what they died for.

02:19:22.388 --> 02:19:24.504
Your Highness...

02:19:41.242 --> 02:19:43.843
You were with him...

02:19:44.619 --> 02:19:47.068
...at the end?

02:19:52.085 --> 02:19:56.157
Emperor, this man fought against you!

02:19:59.759 --> 02:20:01.675
Your Highness...

02:20:02.636 --> 02:20:07.390
...if you believe me to be your enemy,
command me...

02:20:07.391 --> 02:20:10.091
...and l will gladly take my life.

02:20:23.823 --> 02:20:28.076
l have dreamed of a unified Japan...

02:20:28.077 --> 02:20:32.877
...of a country strong
and independent and modern.

02:20:34.042 --> 02:20:38.842
And now we have railroads
and cannon, Western clothing.

02:20:41.798 --> 02:20:43.717
Vut...

02:20:46.803 --> 02:20:51.575
...we cannot forget who we are...

02:20:52.308 --> 02:20:57.108
...or where we come from.

02:21:09.199 --> 02:21:11.951
Ambassador Swanbeck...

02:21:11.952 --> 02:21:14.954
...l have concluded that your treaty...

02:21:14.955 --> 02:21:19.755
...is not in the best interest
of my people.

02:21:20.543 --> 02:21:24.547
- Sir, if l may...
- So sorry...

02:21:24.548 --> 02:21:26.660
...but you may not.

02:21:26.674 --> 02:21:28.709
This is an outrage!

02:21:35.617 --> 02:21:37.642
Enlightened One,
we should discuss this...

02:21:37.643 --> 02:21:39.185
Omura...

02:21:39.186 --> 02:21:41.604
...you have done quite enough.

02:21:41.605 --> 02:21:44.398
Everything l have done,
l have done for my country.

02:21:44.399 --> 02:21:47.611
Then you will not mind
when l seize your family's assets...

02:21:47.612 --> 02:21:50.363
...and present them
as my gift to the people.

02:21:50.364 --> 02:21:52.906
You disgrace me.

02:21:52.907 --> 02:21:55.314
lf your shame is too unbearable...

02:22:04.335 --> 02:22:06.057
...l offer you this sword.

02:22:36.575 --> 02:22:39.569
Tell me how he died.

02:22:46.875 --> 02:22:51.675
l will tell you how he lived.

02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:05.266
<i>And so the days
of the Samurai had ended.</i>

02:23:05.267 --> 02:23:10.067
<i>Nations, like men, it is sometimes said,
have their own destiny.</i>

02:23:11.899 --> 02:23:14.651
<i>As for the American captain...</i>

02:23:14.652 --> 02:23:17.154
<i>... no one knows what became of him.</i>

02:23:17.155 --> 02:23:20.784
<i>Some say that he died of his wounds...</i>

02:23:20.785 --> 02:23:24.911
<i>... others, that he returned
to his own country.</i>

02:23:24.912 --> 02:23:26.704
<i>But I like to think...</i>

02:23:26.705 --> 02:23:31.505
<i>... he may have at last found
some small measure of peace...</i>

02:23:31.962 --> 02:23:34.314
<i>... that we all seek...</i>

02:23:34.715 --> 02:23:38.452
<i>... and few of us ever find.</i>
