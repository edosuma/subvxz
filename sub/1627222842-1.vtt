00:04.738 --> 00:08.042
Wha!

00:25.493 --> 00:28.696
* Waking up with glitter
in my eyes *

00:28.762 --> 00:31.865
* Living in a neon paradise *

00:31.932 --> 00:34.935
* Can't have too many pillows
in my life *

00:35.002 --> 00:38.772
* It's a lot,
but that's all right *

00:38.839 --> 00:42.009
* Find the double-time
in every step *

00:42.076 --> 00:45.346
* Speak my mind
straight up with no regrets *

00:45.413 --> 00:48.449
* I know I'm out
my engine's like a jet *

00:48.516 --> 00:51.719
* I'm revving up,
and that's all right *

00:51.785 --> 00:54.855
* All in, that's who I am *

00:54.922 --> 00:58.559
* I always jump
at the chance to *

00:58.626 --> 01:00.294
* Reach for the stars *

01:00.361 --> 01:01.729
* Glow in the dark *

01:01.795 --> 01:03.264
* Dance through the day *

01:03.331 --> 01:05.499
* Dance, dance
through the day *

01:05.566 --> 01:08.469
* Light up the room,
turn up the tunes *

01:08.536 --> 01:09.903
* Dance through the day *

01:09.970 --> 01:11.905
* Dance, dance through
the day *

01:11.972 --> 01:13.641
* Do my thing, flex my wings *

01:13.707 --> 01:15.409
* Nothing gonna
get me down *

01:15.476 --> 01:17.711
* Anything, bring it,
I'm ready *

01:17.778 --> 01:20.348
* You know I'm gonna
reach for the stars *

01:20.414 --> 01:22.049
* Glow in the dark *

01:22.116 --> 01:23.384
* Dance through the day *

01:23.451 --> 01:25.953
* Dance, dance
through the day *

01:26.019 --> 01:28.956
* Hit the road, just like
my shoes got wheels *

01:29.022 --> 01:32.226
* Spinning around like life's
a Ferris wheel *

01:32.293 --> 01:35.429
* All of the smiles
are giving me the feels *

01:35.496 --> 01:38.799
* It's a lot,
but that's all right *

01:38.866 --> 01:41.969
* All in, that's who I am *

01:42.035 --> 01:45.539
* I always
jump at the chance to *

01:45.606 --> 01:47.241
* Reach for the stars *

01:47.308 --> 01:48.742
* Glow in the dark *

01:48.809 --> 01:50.278
* Dance through the day *

01:50.344 --> 01:52.313
* Dance, dance
through the day *

01:52.380 --> 01:53.714
* Light up the room *

01:53.781 --> 01:55.349
* Turn up the tunes *

01:55.416 --> 01:56.817
* Dance through the day *

01:56.884 --> 01:58.919
* Dance, dance
through the day *

01:58.986 --> 02:00.621
* Do my thing, flex my wings *

02:00.688 --> 02:02.089
* Nothing gonna get me down *

02:02.156 --> 02:04.592
* Anything, bring it,
I'm ready *

02:04.658 --> 02:07.228
* You know I'm gonna
reach for the stars *

02:07.295 --> 02:08.729
* Glow in the dark *

02:08.796 --> 02:10.331
* Dance through the day *

02:10.398 --> 02:11.965
* Dance,
dance through the day *

02:12.032 --> 02:15.669
* Laugh when it don't
go my way *

02:15.736 --> 02:18.806
* Drink it up like lemonade *

02:18.872 --> 02:20.408
* The world is mine *

02:20.474 --> 02:22.543
* Yeah, one big stage *

02:22.610 --> 02:25.613
* I never wanna
change this life *

02:27.548 --> 02:30.150
- Hey! What up, roomies?

02:30.218 --> 02:33.254
all: * Friends forever,
apart or together *

02:33.321 --> 02:36.557
* If someone doesn't like it,
we say whatever *

02:36.624 --> 02:38.592
- Ooh, new high tops?

02:38.659 --> 02:39.927
- You know it.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.029
- Love, it looks like
you got here by unicorn.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.131
- I did!

02:44.198 --> 02:45.165
- Jojo, you can't be late.

02:45.233 --> 02:47.501
You're the team captain,
and FYI,

02:47.568 --> 02:49.970
Nina just volunteered
to lead warm-up for you.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.272
- So nice of her!

02:51.339 --> 02:53.941
See, I told you!
Nina loves me!

02:55.142 --> 02:57.778
- Hey, it's Jojo!

02:57.845 --> 02:59.980
- Hey, so kind of you
to join us.

03:00.047 --> 03:01.982
- Hey, kid.
- Sorry I'm late.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.784
- Were you dancing
with the mailman again?

03:03.851 --> 03:06.787
- What? Me, and mailman?
No, I don't--

03:06.854 --> 03:09.022
Maybe.

03:09.089 --> 03:11.925
- Are you all warmed up?
- I'm always warmed up.

03:11.992 --> 03:16.530
- All right, they're all yours.
- Five, six, seven, eight!

03:16.597 --> 03:18.299
* Reach for the stars *

03:18.366 --> 03:19.833
* Glow in the dark *

03:19.900 --> 03:21.034
* Dance through the day *

03:21.101 --> 03:23.103
* Dance, dance
through the day *

03:23.170 --> 03:26.607
* Light up the room,
turn up the tunes *

03:26.674 --> 03:27.808
* Dance through the day *

03:27.875 --> 03:29.877
* Dance, dance
through the day *

03:29.943 --> 03:31.612
* Do my thing, flex my wings *

03:31.679 --> 03:33.647
* Nothing gonna get me down *

03:33.714 --> 03:35.383
* Anything,
bring it, I'm ready *

03:35.449 --> 03:38.419
* You know I'm gonna
reach for the stars *

03:38.486 --> 03:39.753
* Glow in the dark *

03:39.820 --> 03:41.021
* Dance through the day *

03:41.088 --> 03:44.157
* Dance, dance
through the day *

03:47.395 --> 03:48.829
- All right, that's was great.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.398
Are you all warmed up?

03:50.464 --> 03:53.967
- Yeah!
- Okay, there's something

03:54.034 --> 03:56.003
I would like to talk
with you girls about.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.971
- Ooh! Are we picking out
new competition costumes?

03:58.038 --> 03:59.673
Because I feel like this year,

03:59.740 --> 04:01.141
we've gotta go
head-to-toe flippy sequins.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.943
You know, the ones
where you flip them one way

04:03.010 --> 04:04.312
and they're a happy face
and then you flip them back

04:04.378 --> 04:05.379
and they're something else?

04:05.446 --> 04:06.847
- No, this isn't
about costumes.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.382
- Then, are we learning
our new competition routine?

04:08.449 --> 04:10.117
- Oh!
- No, this is not about

04:10.183 --> 04:12.353
a new routine.
- Hold on a second!

04:12.420 --> 04:14.888
Are we finally getting
that new vending machine.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.224
Please tell me
there's Sour Patch Kids.

04:17.291 --> 04:20.060
- This isn't about
a vending machine.

04:20.127 --> 04:23.063
This is about my future
here at the studio.

04:25.198 --> 04:28.135
After 30 years of teaching
dance, it's time for me

04:28.201 --> 04:30.804
to turn the studio
over to new management.

04:30.871 --> 04:33.374
- Val, no, you can't leave.

04:33.441 --> 04:36.076
- You're not just our coach,
you're our mentor.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.845
- A second mother.
- You taught us

04:37.911 --> 04:40.314
about expressing ourself
through movement.

04:40.381 --> 04:43.250
- And living in the moment.
- And freestyle Fridays.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.819
- Look, girls, I don't want
to view this

04:45.886 --> 04:48.288
as something to be sad about.

04:48.356 --> 04:52.092
I want you to look at this
as an exciting change.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.666
- I put a lot of thought into
who should take over the studio

04:58.732 --> 05:00.634
and I found someone.

05:00.701 --> 05:04.171
Someone who is just
as passionate about dance

05:04.237 --> 05:06.807
and developing young,
creative spirits.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.976
I know you'll be in good hands.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.545
Girls, I'd like you
to meet

05:11.612 --> 05:15.383
your new dance instructor,
Poppy.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.728
- Do you hear that?
- Yeah.

05:27.795 --> 05:30.498
It's like she has
her own theme song.

05:34.368 --> 05:37.638
- Not now, Mom.
I'm changing lives.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.509
It's Coach Poppy,
and thanks for the intro,

05:41.575 --> 05:43.944
but I got it from here.
- But I thought we discussed

05:44.011 --> 05:45.513
that I was gonna--
- Yeah, yeah,

05:45.579 --> 05:47.047
I'm totally going to foster
their young, creative spirits

05:47.114 --> 05:48.549
and move their delicate minds
and all that jazz.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.317
- But the gradual transition...
- Transition you out,

05:50.384 --> 05:51.752
though, first,
- Where I was going to stay

05:51.819 --> 05:52.720
for a while and make sure
the girls are okay.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.054
- Build, build as a team.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.322
- I just have one more thing
I want to say--

05:55.389 --> 05:56.490
- Thanks so much!
We don't validate anymore.

05:56.557 --> 05:59.292
Sorry. Bye, bye.
Whew! There.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.594
That's better.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.730
Now where was I? Yes?

06:02.796 --> 06:05.265
- Bonding and team building.
- Right.

06:05.332 --> 06:08.436
Speaking of which, would you
like to be my special helper.

06:08.502 --> 06:11.071
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.541
Here.
Take this and build me a latte.

06:13.607 --> 06:16.577
Four shots, five Splendas,
no foam, it's annoying.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.111
- This is a dollar.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.213
- Then feel free
to get yourself an ice water.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.716
Okay, go on. Go. Go, go.

06:24.918 --> 06:29.089
Aw, cheer up ladies.
This is going to be fun.

06:29.156 --> 06:33.326
So, so fun,
as long as follow my rules.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.698
- Number one, if you're not
five minutes early,

06:37.765 --> 06:40.367
then you are late and if you
are late, you are locked out.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.838
- Can you hear
my heart beating?

06:44.905 --> 06:46.239
- It's cool, we got it.
We got it.

06:46.306 --> 06:50.277
- Here's the deal.
I am here to build the A Team,

06:50.343 --> 06:53.413
but right now, you guys
are just the Okay Team.

06:53.481 --> 06:56.416
So starting today, every class
will now include

06:56.484 --> 06:59.052
boot camp-style conditioning.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.988
Aw, we're all disappointed.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.223
Aw, I'm sorry.
I don't make the rules.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.192
Oh, wait, hold on.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.394
Yes I do!

07:07.461 --> 07:08.829
Back up and form three lines.

07:08.896 --> 07:12.666
Let's go!
Burpees till it burns.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.635
Lunge for days.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.203
Push-ups till you throw up.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.372
- Breathe. I am strong.
I can do hard things.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.675
- And finally, every dancer
must wear

07:21.742 --> 07:23.511
the same uniform in gray.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.546
- Not gray.

07:25.613 --> 07:28.081
Did I just say that out loud?

07:29.216 --> 07:32.185
- And you are?
- I'm Jojo.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.622
I've been taking dance here
since I was, like, mm, five.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.958
- Aw, cute! And does Jojo,
who's been taking dance here

07:38.025 --> 07:41.161
since she was, like, five,
have a problem with gray?

07:41.228 --> 07:43.463
- No! I mean--

07:43.531 --> 07:45.733
well, yeah.
- Yeah.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.936
- It's just so gray.
- Oh, yeah.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.604
- Could we possibly
like juj it up.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.005
- Juj.
- Yeah!

07:52.072 --> 07:55.609
We could add some color,
maybe even some sparkles.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.678
- Sparkle?
- Yeah!

07:57.745 --> 07:59.279
- You know what?
That is a great idea.

07:59.346 --> 08:02.516
You know, let me think
about that for a second.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.352
Nope! Moving on!

08:05.418 --> 08:09.022
Oh, before I forget.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.058
No high tops, no ponytails,

08:11.124 --> 08:13.026
and absolutely positively

08:13.093 --> 08:15.963
no bows.

08:20.367 --> 08:26.373
- Did you just say no--
- Bows.

08:26.439 --> 08:29.076
Knees up! Let's go!

08:29.142 --> 08:31.945
That is not--what is this?
Get those knees up!

08:32.012 --> 08:33.814
Knees, knees, knees!
I said knees!

08:43.691 --> 08:45.392
- Hey!
- Hey, guys!

08:51.264 --> 08:55.535
- You okay, Jojo?
- Me? Oh, sure. I'm great.

08:55.603 --> 08:56.870
- Yeah.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.872
This is a tough transition
for all of us,

08:58.939 --> 09:01.842
but we know it's been
extra hard on you.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.977
- What? No, I'm good. I'm good!

09:04.044 --> 09:06.379
Plain gray,
it's actually my favorite.

09:06.446 --> 09:07.915
Uh, you know,

09:07.981 --> 09:13.486
it's like we're twirling,
leaping, cinder blocks!

09:14.788 --> 09:16.023
Enough about me!

09:16.089 --> 09:17.424
Someone's about
to have a birthday

09:17.490 --> 09:19.793
and we have some major planning
we've got to do.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.929
- Oh, you guys don't have to go
to a ton of trouble.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.230
- Are you kidding me?

09:23.296 --> 09:25.532
It's your sweet sixteen,
of course we do!

09:25.599 --> 09:27.000
We've got to do it up big!

09:27.067 --> 09:29.670
- Yeah, like a Velcro wall
or a mechanical bull.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.171
- Ooh! Yeah!

09:31.238 --> 09:33.473
- Well, I did see this one guy
on Instagram

09:33.540 --> 09:36.710
who can make a life-size
cotton candy sculpture of you.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.445
- Done!
- Absolutely.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.681
- Jojo, please don't break
the dress code again.

09:40.748 --> 09:43.516
My quads are still burning
from all the extra squats

09:43.583 --> 09:44.885
we had to do last practice,

09:44.952 --> 09:47.020
when you forgot
to take out your bow.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.189
- Oh, I'm so sorry
about that, Nina.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.258
It won't happen again,
I promise.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.528
Hey, guys, ready to go in?

09:55.595 --> 09:57.230
- Jojo, your bow.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.603
- Val gave me this bow.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.107
Told me she hoped
that I would always dance

10:07.174 --> 10:08.876
to the beat of my own drum.

10:12.846 --> 10:15.749
I don't know
if I can do it, guys.

10:15.816 --> 10:20.788
Looking the same as everyone
just doesn't feel right.

10:20.854 --> 10:23.824
- I know this is hard, Jojo,
but you know the rules.

10:23.891 --> 10:27.060
- If she catches you with a bow
again, you're off the team.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.940
- Hear me out.

10:40.007 --> 10:43.010
What if--

10:43.076 --> 10:45.645
What if she doesn't see it?

10:48.215 --> 10:53.386
- The doors will be closing
in five, four, three--

10:53.453 --> 10:54.855
- We're here, we're here!
Ready to boogie!

10:54.922 --> 10:59.292
- Two!

10:59.359 --> 11:02.362
Delightful.
Gather around.

11:02.429 --> 11:05.766
Now, as you may know, our first
opportunity to compete

11:05.833 --> 11:09.636
will be at the upcoming
Main Street Dance Competition.

11:09.703 --> 11:12.539
Small potatoes, but we are
going for two reasons:

11:12.605 --> 11:16.343
One, to scope
out the competition.

11:16.409 --> 11:20.147
And two,
to practice crushing them.

11:20.213 --> 11:23.216
That way, we'll be ready
for the real competition.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.551
- The real competition?

11:24.617 --> 11:26.987
- The First Position
Competition,

11:27.054 --> 11:29.456
the only competition
that matters.

11:33.994 --> 11:37.831
Ooh, I look good.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.533
Look at me.

11:40.600 --> 11:41.835
Anyway, I digress.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.037
First things first,
to the mirror! Voila!

11:44.104 --> 11:47.174
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

11:47.240 --> 11:50.911
Now, when you look
in the mirror, what do you see?

11:50.978 --> 11:55.548
- Cement? Storm clouds.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.117
Statue of me.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.786
- Gigi.
- Jojo.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.354
- Okay. When I ask a question,

12:01.421 --> 12:02.956
I don't actually
want an answer.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.457
- You don't?

12:04.524 --> 12:07.160
- No, I want you to wait
an appropriate amount of time,

12:07.227 --> 12:09.229
till you feel just
the right amount of awkward,

12:09.296 --> 12:11.531
and then I will answer it
for you.

12:11.598 --> 12:12.532
Do you understand?

12:12.599 --> 12:14.167
- But I was just--
- No!

12:14.234 --> 12:16.136
Again, that is a question

12:16.203 --> 12:18.505
I don't actually
want an answer for.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.041
- Okay, but I was just being--
- Moving on!

12:21.108 --> 12:23.576
Ciao!

12:23.643 --> 12:27.547
All right, who here can tell me
why we practice so hard?

12:27.614 --> 12:31.084
Oh, that's actually a question
I do want an answer to.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.786
- To express
what's inside of us?

12:32.853 --> 12:33.854
- Nope.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.655
- So we can bond as a team?

12:35.722 --> 12:37.090
- Not even close.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.591
- To squash the dreams
of our competitors.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.727
- Ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding!

12:40.794 --> 12:42.830
Yes! I smell a winner!

12:42.896 --> 12:43.931
Go ahead, Tina!

12:43.997 --> 12:46.766
- It's Nina.
- Back up! Listen!

12:46.834 --> 12:49.402
Now, it's time for me
to make you all into winners.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.572
All right? Back up! Spread out!

12:52.639 --> 12:54.007
Two lines! Let's go!

12:58.445 --> 12:59.679
No!

12:59.746 --> 13:03.150
- * Boom, boom
thunder in the room *

13:03.216 --> 13:05.152
* Don't make a wrong move *

13:05.218 --> 13:08.121
* What do I do? *

13:08.188 --> 13:11.291
* Knock, knock,
I see that road block *

13:11.358 --> 13:13.126
* Won't let the show stop *

13:13.193 --> 13:16.429
- What is this lallygagging?
- * You don't know what I got *

13:16.496 --> 13:20.200
* One chance, go and get it
don't you quit it *

13:20.267 --> 13:22.669
- No! Ahh!
- * Give it one chance *

13:22.735 --> 13:24.304
* Go and face it,
don't you waste it *

13:24.371 --> 13:26.339
* You get one chance *

13:26.406 --> 13:28.175
- Come on! Come on, ladies!

13:28.241 --> 13:31.411
- * And it's my one chance,
one chance *

13:31.478 --> 13:32.679
- That is not low.
You call that low?

13:32.745 --> 13:35.015
Low, low, low, low!

13:35.082 --> 13:39.286
* One, one chance *

13:39.352 --> 13:41.621
* One, one, one chance *

13:41.688 --> 13:44.691
* Hey, hey, haters in my way *

13:44.757 --> 13:49.596
* Not throwing my game,
nothing can phase me *

13:49.662 --> 13:55.302
* Won't stop, you know
I'm so not ready to give up *

13:55.368 --> 13:59.639
* As long as I still got
one chance *

13:59.706 --> 14:01.508
* Go and get it,
don't you quit it *

14:01.574 --> 14:04.111
* Give it one chance *

14:04.177 --> 14:06.113
* Go and face it,
don't you waste it *

14:06.179 --> 14:08.115
* You get one chance *

14:08.181 --> 14:10.283
* Hear it calling,
going in all in *

14:10.350 --> 14:17.190
* It's my one chance,
one chance *

14:17.257 --> 14:19.359
* One, one, one chance *

14:19.426 --> 14:23.096
- Precision, ladies!
- * One, one, one chance *

14:23.163 --> 14:24.764
- Stop!
Everybody freeze.

14:24.831 --> 14:29.236
Freeze, freeze, freeze.
What is going on around here?

14:29.302 --> 14:32.739
And by here, I mean here.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.141
- What?

14:34.207 --> 14:37.677
- Jojo, your personality
is poking me in my eyeball.

14:37.744 --> 14:39.980
You're sticking out
and pulling focus.

14:40.047 --> 14:42.415
You know what you are?
You're a pop-a-color.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.584
- Yeah!
- No, that is not a compliment.

14:44.651 --> 14:48.155
Stop popping!
There's no popping. Pop it off!

14:48.221 --> 14:52.092
Miss Thing,
you have to blend in.

14:52.159 --> 14:56.296
- You--you want me to--ha.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.865
- Yeah, get it out.
You can do it.

14:58.932 --> 15:02.002
both: Blend.
- In.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.071
- Um, Coach Poppy?
- You are?

15:04.137 --> 15:09.309
- Afraid. Oh, I mean, hi.
I'm Ruby D and she's Ruby M,

15:09.376 --> 15:11.244
but most people just call us
the Rubies.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.980
Apparently, it was
a very popular name

15:13.046 --> 15:14.181
the year we were born.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.949
There's also two Olivias,
four Sophias,

15:16.016 --> 15:17.117
and a growing number of Avas--

15:17.184 --> 15:18.418
- I'm sorry,
are you still talking?

15:18.485 --> 15:19.752
I stopped listening.

15:19.819 --> 15:22.389
The glare from your glasses
is distracting.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.623
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.258
- I think what Ruby
is trying to say

15:25.325 --> 15:29.529
is that Jojo is a great dancer,
maybe the strongest we have.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.498
If you find yourself drawn
to watching Jojo,

15:31.564 --> 15:34.267
doesn't that just mean--
- No! No, no, no, no, no!

15:34.334 --> 15:37.270
I don't want to see
individual faces.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.906
I don't want to see
none of this...

15:39.973 --> 15:42.009
or this...

15:42.075 --> 15:44.111
or this.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.113
None of it.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.615
I just want one glorious,

15:48.681 --> 15:51.318
homogenized blob
of perfect technique

15:51.384 --> 15:53.586
and if the Rubies can't get
with the program,

15:53.653 --> 15:56.589
then, well, maybe the Rubies
can start a Jojo fan club

15:56.656 --> 15:58.992
with all the free time
you have on your hands

15:59.059 --> 16:00.760
when you're off my team.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.065
- I'll do it.
- What?

16:05.132 --> 16:06.433
- What?
- I'll do it.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.800
I'll try harder to blend in.

16:07.867 --> 16:10.070
- Terrific. Moving on.
- I love this place.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.571
- And she's still talking.

16:11.638 --> 16:15.775
- It's my second home,
and you guys, you guys

16:15.842 --> 16:17.744
are all like my sisters.

16:17.810 --> 16:21.614
Most weeks, I spend more time
here than I do at my own house

16:21.681 --> 16:24.584
and when I'm here, I feel like
I'm at my favorite place

16:24.651 --> 16:27.887
and I'm with
my favorite people.

16:27.954 --> 16:31.291
So I'll do it.
I can blend, watch!

16:33.126 --> 16:35.328
See, look at me.

16:35.395 --> 16:39.332
I'm a dancing robot.
I feel nothing.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.803
Totally dead inside.

16:49.909 --> 16:52.845
That good, eh?

16:52.912 --> 16:54.914
- What is that?
- What? What is what?

16:54.981 --> 16:57.484
- That glittering monstrosity
on your head.

16:59.952 --> 17:02.222
- Oh, this!
This is a new product

17:02.289 --> 17:03.723
to fluff my bun, actually.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.326
It's called a bun fluffer.
- That's not a bun fluffer.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.027
That's a bow.

17:08.095 --> 17:10.730
A big, happy, glittering bow,

17:10.797 --> 17:12.699
and I do not
like glitter, Jojo.

17:12.765 --> 17:15.302
- Who doesn't like glitter?

17:15.368 --> 17:17.404
- Look, Poppy,
if you want to be part

17:17.470 --> 17:19.005
of Mr. Melody's Glitter Girls,

17:19.072 --> 17:20.240
then I'm going to need you
to sparkle.

17:20.307 --> 17:21.541
Give me sparkle!

17:23.276 --> 17:27.947
Sparkle! Sparkle!

17:28.014 --> 17:30.783
Ugh, stop.

17:30.850 --> 17:34.987
Halt! Poppy, cease and desist!

17:35.054 --> 17:36.856
I need some expression!

17:36.923 --> 17:43.596
Give me this and this,
and this!

17:43.663 --> 17:45.265
Show her how it's done, girls.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.669
- See, see, see!
Look at your little sister!

17:49.736 --> 17:52.405
If Rosie can sparkle,
why can't you?

17:52.472 --> 17:56.909
Yes, Rosie, yes!
Give me Madonna!

17:56.976 --> 17:58.878
Paula Abdul!

17:58.945 --> 18:03.350
And Miss Jackson,
'cause you're in control!

18:03.416 --> 18:05.084
And I'm never going to stop.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.988
- Uh, uh, uh, excuse me, madam,

18:09.055 --> 18:11.858
but there is no crying
in Mr. Melody's Glitter Girls.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.427
- But I saw you crying
in the parking lot.

18:16.062 --> 18:17.397
- Out!

18:17.464 --> 18:19.666
You are hereby banished
from the Glitter Girls.

18:22.969 --> 18:28.275
And FYI, Poppy, you will never
success if you can't sparkle.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.944
- What do you think
is happening right now?

18:32.011 --> 18:35.148
- Maybe she's having
a flashback.

18:35.215 --> 18:38.251
- I am, I'm almost done.

18:38.318 --> 18:41.421
Okay, I'm done. Where was I?

18:41.488 --> 18:42.789
- Ooh, I know!

18:42.855 --> 18:46.025
And I do not
like glitter, Jojo!

18:46.092 --> 18:49.529
- Right. And I do not
like glitter, Jojo!

18:49.596 --> 18:52.031
And you are like human glitter,

18:52.098 --> 18:54.801
and I just don't think you're
the right fit for this team.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.337
- What? No, no, no!
I will do anything.

18:57.404 --> 18:58.971
- Anything?
- Anything!

18:59.038 --> 19:01.708
- Okay, well, if you want
to stay on this team,

19:01.774 --> 19:05.978
then I suggest that you find
your sparkle switch

19:06.045 --> 19:07.480
and turn it off.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.118
- Okay.

19:45.718 --> 19:50.089
- Moving on.
Form two lines, eyes on me.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.399
- Okay. We've got my bags.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.434
Desi! Hey!

20:01.501 --> 20:04.103
- Jojo! Hi!

20:04.170 --> 20:05.472
- Aw, how are you?

20:05.538 --> 20:08.675
- I'm good.
Girl, should I call 9-1-1?

20:08.741 --> 20:10.777
Because someone's
stolen your sparkle.

20:10.843 --> 20:13.280
I didn't even recognize you
without your bow.

20:13.346 --> 20:17.750
- Yeah. Me neither.
New coach, new rules.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.587
You, though--
you look fabulous!

20:20.653 --> 20:22.355
- I know, right?

20:22.422 --> 20:24.691
The only good part about moving
away from my mom's new job

20:24.757 --> 20:26.693
is that I could start fresh
at a new school,

20:26.759 --> 20:30.263
new dance studio
and just be who I really am,

20:30.330 --> 20:33.199
and this, is who I really am.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.668
- Aw, I love it!

20:35.735 --> 20:38.971
You seem so happy,
and that makes me really happy.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.673
So your new studio,
are they good.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.709
- Oh, it'll do.
But I miss you guys.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.277
It's just not the same.

20:44.344 --> 20:47.580
- Trust me, literally nothing
is the same.

21:06.132 --> 21:09.001
- These are some warm-up suits.
What does P-PAC stand for?

21:09.068 --> 21:10.703
- Poppy's Performing
Arts Center.

21:10.770 --> 21:14.574
Jojo, be like Beyonce
and get in formation.

21:14.641 --> 21:17.209
- Oh, these are so heavy.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.678
See you, Desi.
- Bye.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.947
- And there's so many.

21:21.013 --> 21:25.151
Excuse me, guys.
Don't mind me! Sorry.

21:59.886 --> 22:02.254
- And now, formerly known
as Dance Mentions.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.023
from Poppy's Performing
Art Center,

22:04.090 --> 22:07.226
please welcome the P-PAC!

22:54.907 --> 22:57.844
- Wow, so precise and in sync!

22:57.910 --> 23:02.081
- So graceful, and yet,
I'm intimidating by them.

23:02.148 --> 23:03.550
Almost scared.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.452
- That's exactly
what I was going for.

23:10.790 --> 23:15.695
- What in human combination?

23:15.762 --> 23:18.330
Jojo, knock it off!

23:24.403 --> 23:26.172
- Jojo, knock it off!

23:37.984 --> 23:39.418
- Then that lift
at the beginning,

23:39.486 --> 23:41.554
that was like the best time
we ever did it! I--

23:41.621 --> 23:43.656
- Hey, Desi! Congrats!

23:43.723 --> 23:45.291
Oh my gosh,
your team was amazing.

23:45.357 --> 23:47.994
- Stop, you're too kind.
Tell me more.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.362
- And you guys are fantastic.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.531
I loved your solo.

23:51.598 --> 23:54.066
- Yeah. Nice solo, Jojo.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.935
- Apparently a fourth place
trophy is too embarrassing

23:56.002 --> 23:57.369
to even bring home.

23:57.436 --> 23:58.938
- Don't even sweat it.
This competition is just

23:59.005 --> 24:00.940
a warm-up to the first position
competition.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.074
I'll see you there, right?

24:02.141 --> 24:04.844
- Of course you will--
- Jojo!

24:04.911 --> 24:06.445
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

24:06.513 --> 24:09.081
- Congratulations?
How about you're welcome,

24:09.148 --> 24:10.917
'cause you basically
gave 'em first place!

24:10.983 --> 24:12.418
I mean, look at her.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.153
What am I supposed to do--
take this little thing.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.222
Everybody else
was giving fierce blue steel

24:16.288 --> 24:19.058
while you were out there
looking like human jazz hands

24:19.125 --> 24:20.392
with a glitter manicure

24:20.459 --> 24:24.564
and you know
I do not like glitter, Jojo!

24:24.631 --> 24:27.133
- I'm sorry, guys.

24:27.199 --> 24:30.169
Listen, I tried to turn off my
sparkle switch, I really did.

24:30.236 --> 24:31.904
Then it was like
the beat kicked in

24:31.971 --> 24:33.606
and I just felt it in my bones.

24:33.673 --> 24:36.075
It was like, my brain knew that
I wasn't supposed to sparkle,

24:36.142 --> 24:37.910
but nothing
told my feet or my face.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.211
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:39.278 --> 24:40.747
You know what,
this isn't working out.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.214
We're breaking up with you.

24:42.281 --> 24:46.085
- What? We are?
- No, we're not. We're not.

24:46.152 --> 24:51.057
- Then I am!
It's not you, Jojo, it's me.

24:51.123 --> 24:52.725
- What?
- No, who we are kidding.

24:52.792 --> 24:55.494
It's totally you.
P-PAC your bags.

24:55.562 --> 24:59.031
Oh, and FYI, you will never
success if you don't learn

24:59.098 --> 25:01.433
how to turn off your sparkle.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.969
- I--
- No, no.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.838
- Please just--
- Zip it!

25:05.905 --> 25:08.808
Moving on!

25:09.842 --> 25:11.410
- Guys.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.653
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.688
You know,
I've gone to that studio

25:55.755 --> 25:58.124
almost every day
that I can remember

25:58.190 --> 26:02.328
and without it,
I don't know where to go.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.997
- Oh, sweetheart.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.133
You know she tricked me.

26:07.199 --> 26:09.902
Told me she wanted to cultivate
a competitive spirit

26:09.969 --> 26:12.404
in our youth
and foster creativity.

26:12.471 --> 26:13.673
- Yeah.
- Uh-uh.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.107
Then she changed the locks

26:15.174 --> 26:17.710
and didn't even invite me
to the competition.

26:17.777 --> 26:20.046
- That's why you weren't there!

26:20.112 --> 26:23.149
Oh, and she also changed
the name of the studio.

26:23.215 --> 26:24.851
- She didn't.
- She did.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.386
To Poppy's Performing
Art Center.

26:27.453 --> 26:29.521
P-PAC for short.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.290
- P-PAC?
- P-PAC.

26:31.357 --> 26:34.560
- Oh, I'd like to P-PAC her
right in the face.

26:34.627 --> 26:37.463
- Oh, wow.

26:37.529 --> 26:41.634
I am so sorry, Jojo.
I feel like this is my fault.

26:41.701 --> 26:44.203
- It's not your fault, and I
don't want you to be sorry.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.305
Coach Poppy is
who should be sorry.

26:46.372 --> 26:49.976
- Hey! We had a feeling this
is where you would be.

26:50.042 --> 26:53.813
- Are you okay, Jojo?

26:53.880 --> 26:57.049
- Okay, girls, come with me.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.651
I want to show you something.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.720
Even though it seems
everybody else is doing things

27:00.787 --> 27:03.990
one way doesn't mean
it's the right way for you.

27:04.056 --> 27:07.326
You don't need that studio
to do what you love.

27:07.393 --> 27:10.362
If you really want to perform,

27:10.429 --> 27:12.832
you'll find a way
to do it anywhere.

27:12.899 --> 27:17.169
- Wow! Look at this place!

27:17.236 --> 27:19.171
- What is all this stuff?

27:19.238 --> 27:22.608
- Odds and ends, just things
I've collected from decades

27:22.675 --> 27:26.078
of putting on dance recitals
and shows.

27:26.145 --> 27:29.281
- Are there mirrors in here?
- Oh, lots of 'em.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.350
- Do you guys see what I see?

27:31.417 --> 27:35.254
- Three, possibly four,
different kinds of spiders.

27:35.321 --> 27:39.125
No. Potential.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.365
* Another day
in a crazy world *

27:46.432 --> 27:48.334
* Hanging on
for another curve *

27:48.400 --> 27:52.504
* Every bend, every kiss
can turn you round and round *

27:52.571 --> 27:54.440
* Holding on,
it's a wild ride *

27:54.506 --> 27:56.809
* It's all new when
you blink your eyes *

27:56.876 --> 28:00.813
* Suddenly everything inside
goes upside down *

28:00.880 --> 28:02.915
* Don't matter what's up next *

28:02.982 --> 28:05.084
* Close my eyes
and take a step *

28:05.151 --> 28:09.021
* I'm ready for whatever,
here we go *

28:09.088 --> 28:13.192
* Oh, oh, oh it's
only getting better *

28:13.259 --> 28:17.096
* Oh, oh, oh don't want
to catch my breath *

28:17.163 --> 28:19.065
* We'll race through
every open door *

28:19.131 --> 28:21.333
* Find everything we're hoping
for *

28:21.400 --> 28:23.335
* As long as we're together *

28:23.402 --> 28:25.738
* It's only getting better *

28:30.076 --> 28:32.211
* Another day, it's a mystery *

28:32.278 --> 28:34.280
* A million possibilities *

28:34.346 --> 28:38.417
* Taking a chance,
it'll all be easier in time *

28:38.484 --> 28:40.452
* Every day
is a new adventure *

28:40.519 --> 28:42.521
* Turn the page,
it's a whole new chapter *

28:42.588 --> 28:46.959
* Something great up ahead
will make you feel alive *

28:47.026 --> 28:48.527
* I'm hoping for the best *

28:48.594 --> 28:51.030
* Close my eyes
and take that step *

28:51.097 --> 28:54.834
* I'm ready for whatever,
here we go *

28:54.901 --> 28:58.905
* Oh, oh, oh
it's only getting better *

28:58.971 --> 29:03.042
* Oh, oh, oh don't want
to catch my breath *

29:03.109 --> 29:05.077
* We'll race through
every open door *

29:05.144 --> 29:07.046
* Find everything
we're hoping for *

29:07.113 --> 29:11.150
* As long as we're together,
it's only getting better *

29:11.217 --> 29:15.387
* It's changing in an instant
and everything is different *

29:15.454 --> 29:17.523
* But I'm ready for whatever *

29:17.589 --> 29:21.093
* I'm ready for whatever *

29:27.834 --> 29:30.436
* Getting better *

29:36.775 --> 29:38.644
* Here we go *

29:38.710 --> 29:42.882
* Oh, oh, oh it's only
getting better *

29:42.949 --> 29:47.086
* Oh, oh, oh I don't wanna
catch my breath *

29:47.153 --> 29:49.088
* We'll race through
every open door *

29:49.155 --> 29:51.157
* Find everything
we're hoping for *

29:51.223 --> 29:53.059
* As long as we're together *

29:53.125 --> 29:57.729
* It's only getting better
it's only getting better *

29:57.796 --> 30:00.666
* Oh, oh, oh *

30:04.203 --> 30:05.571
Guys! I have an idea!

30:05.637 --> 30:08.607
- Ooh, breakfast for dinner.
- Close!

30:08.674 --> 30:10.209
Why don't we
start our own team?

30:10.276 --> 30:12.111
- Uh, like a dodgeball team?

30:12.178 --> 30:14.246
- No, no, no,
like a dance team.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.681
Jojo and the Rubies.

30:15.747 --> 30:17.449
We're already sound
like a rock band,

30:17.516 --> 30:19.818
and there's still so much time.
We can make up a routine

30:19.886 --> 30:22.521
and register for
the First Position Competition.

30:22.588 --> 30:25.691
- I don't know, Jojo.
It's a fun idea.

30:25.757 --> 30:28.794
So fun, but the thing is,

30:28.861 --> 30:31.163
Poppy says we're going to
win Nationals this year

30:31.230 --> 30:33.966
and I've never won anything.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.801
Not even "Solitaire."

30:35.868 --> 30:38.270
- Yeah. Part of me
totally wants to quit the team

30:38.337 --> 30:40.873
and joins yours,
but the other part of me

30:40.940 --> 30:42.841
knows my folks will kill me
because they already paid

30:42.909 --> 30:45.377
for my competition costumes,

30:45.444 --> 30:46.946
and since I'm both
a people pleaser

30:47.013 --> 30:49.248
and a chronic rule follower,
I'm not quite sure

30:49.315 --> 30:51.517
which particular part
to pick presently.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.452
- It's all right, guys.
It was just an idea.

30:53.519 --> 30:54.786
- JoJo.
- No, really.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.956
If you guys want to stay
in the P-PAC, I get it.

30:57.023 --> 30:58.224
It's totally okay.

30:58.290 --> 30:59.892
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.994
- We're still going to hang out
on my birthday, right?

31:02.061 --> 31:04.730
- Are you kidding?
We better be.

31:04.796 --> 31:07.766
all: * Friends forever,
apart or together *

31:07.833 --> 31:11.971
* If someone doesn't like it
We say, "Whatever" *

31:12.038 --> 31:14.540
- Again.
Five, six, seven, eight.

31:14.606 --> 31:16.675
And one, two, three, four.

31:16.742 --> 31:19.845
Lines, lines,
seven, eight, two, two.

31:19.912 --> 31:21.113
What are you doing?

31:21.180 --> 31:23.015
Five, six,
you're looking janky.

31:23.082 --> 31:26.118
Stop.
Oh, y'all look a hot mess.

31:26.185 --> 31:28.187
Y'all got my choreo
looking basic.

31:28.254 --> 31:31.190
Take five and go get better.
Just--would you?

31:31.257 --> 31:33.359
- Hey, remember this?

31:36.462 --> 31:39.331
- Hey. What is that?

31:39.398 --> 31:41.133
- What? What was what?
Who? What? Where?

31:41.200 --> 31:43.269
Knock-knock. Who's there?

31:43.335 --> 31:44.836
- What's that move?
Do it again.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.173
- What move? This move?

31:48.574 --> 31:50.509
- Oh, I like it.
We're putting it in.

31:50.576 --> 31:53.179
Let's go!

31:55.081 --> 31:57.349
- You're all right, Bobo?

31:57.416 --> 32:00.052
I know, we haven't been
to a park in a while,

32:00.119 --> 32:03.956
but suddenly I have a lot
of free times on my hands,

32:04.023 --> 32:05.724
so you better get ready
because it looks like

32:05.791 --> 32:09.161
we're gonna be doing this
a lot more often.

32:12.898 --> 32:16.202
Hold on. You stay here.
I'll be right back.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.539
* What you gonna do when
they're telling you no *

32:20.606 --> 32:22.074
* You're going to get
your team together *

32:22.141 --> 32:23.509
* 'Cause you're ready to go *

32:23.575 --> 32:27.313
* All day, all night, our way *

32:27.379 --> 32:28.614
* Yeah, we do it right *

32:28.680 --> 32:29.748
* Headed for the goal *

32:29.815 --> 32:31.050
* That's the way that we roll *

32:31.117 --> 32:32.584
* Yeah, we got
a lot of confidence *

32:32.651 --> 32:33.852
* We taking control *

32:33.919 --> 32:38.057
* Our move, our shot,
can't lose *

32:38.124 --> 32:39.691
* Never giving up *

32:39.758 --> 32:41.893
* Slam dunk, knockout, think
we're going to slow down *

32:41.960 --> 32:43.062
* Don't blink now *

32:43.129 --> 32:44.496
* We'll get you
on the rebound *

32:44.563 --> 32:47.199
* Me, you, this is what we do *

32:47.266 --> 32:49.668
* Gonna show 'em who we are *

32:49.735 --> 32:51.937
* One crew,
everything to prove *

32:52.004 --> 32:55.307
* Say hello
to the new all-stars *

32:55.374 --> 32:57.609
* Our game, our rules *

32:57.676 --> 32:59.711
* Everybody on their mark *

32:59.778 --> 33:01.213
* Hit it out of the park *

33:01.280 --> 33:02.714
* Hit it out
of the park *

33:02.781 --> 33:05.284
* Going to hit it, hit it,
hit it out of the park *

33:10.556 --> 33:12.691
* Try to keep us out,
we just do it our way *

33:12.758 --> 33:14.393
* We'll be stepping up
like champions *

33:14.460 --> 33:15.661
* Who came here to play *

33:15.727 --> 33:19.665
* Our move, our shot,
can't lose *

33:19.731 --> 33:21.233
* Give it all we got *

33:21.300 --> 33:23.635
* Slam dunk, knockout, think
we're in a free fall *

33:23.702 --> 33:24.936
* Don't blink now *

33:25.003 --> 33:26.272
* We'll get you
with the curveball *

33:26.338 --> 33:28.807
* Me, you, this is what we do *

33:28.874 --> 33:31.543
* Gonna show them who we are *

33:31.610 --> 33:33.845
* One crew,
everything to prove *

33:33.912 --> 33:37.149
* Say hello
to the new all-stars *

33:37.216 --> 33:39.385
* Our game, our rules *

33:39.451 --> 33:41.453
* Everybody on their mark *

33:41.520 --> 33:43.889
* Hit it out of the park,
hit it out of the park,

33:43.955 --> 33:46.658
* Gonna hit it, hit it,
hit it out of the park *

33:46.725 --> 33:49.195
* Hit it out of the park,
hit it out of the park *

33:49.261 --> 33:52.164
* Gonna hit it, hit it, hit it
out of the park *

33:52.231 --> 33:53.399
* Roll up our sleeves *

33:53.465 --> 33:54.666
* Don't you see the potential *

33:54.733 --> 33:55.801
* All for the team *

33:55.867 --> 33:57.569
* We can be something special *

33:57.636 --> 34:00.005
* Hold up your dreams
to a whole 'nother level *

34:00.072 --> 34:02.674
* What you gonna do
when they're telling you no *

34:02.741 --> 34:05.544
* Me, you, this is what we do *

34:05.611 --> 34:08.380
* Gonna show them who we are *

34:08.447 --> 34:10.349
* One crew,
everything to prove *

34:10.416 --> 34:13.552
* Say hello to the new
all-stars *

34:13.619 --> 34:15.821
* Our game, our rules *

34:15.887 --> 34:17.956
* Everybody on their mark *

34:18.023 --> 34:20.659
* Hit it out of the park,
hit it out of the park *

34:20.726 --> 34:23.162
* Gonna hit it, hit it, hit it
out of the park *

34:23.229 --> 34:25.831
* Hit it out of the park,
hit it out of the park *

34:25.897 --> 34:28.434
* Gonna hit it, hit it,
hit it out of the park *

34:30.902 --> 34:35.274
- Looks like I'm gonna
need more hot chocolate.

34:35.341 --> 34:37.176
- You wanna win?

34:37.243 --> 34:43.382
Well, winning costs, and right
here is where you start paying.

34:46.218 --> 34:51.523
- Uh, yeah, so I knew
you would agree, girl.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.625
Yeah, so I'm going to just
talk to you later, okay?

34:53.692 --> 34:56.762
Bye-bye. Beep.

34:56.828 --> 34:58.930
- That was a really great
practice today, coach,

34:58.997 --> 35:01.099
really great.
- Spit it out, Phoebe.

35:01.167 --> 35:03.435
- Ruby.
- Right.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.103
- I was just wondering
if we can end practice

35:05.171 --> 35:08.240
on time next Saturday,
I'm having a few friends over.

35:08.307 --> 35:09.908
- How nice.
What's the occasion?

35:09.975 --> 35:12.043
- Oh, it's nothing,
my birthday.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.645
- Oh, fun!

35:13.712 --> 35:15.814
- So we can end practice
on time?

35:15.881 --> 35:20.319
- Of course not.
We will stop when we're done.

35:20.386 --> 35:22.421
- Oh.
- Also, what should I bring?

35:23.622 --> 35:25.557
- Excuse me?
- To the party.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.294
- Oh, it's not a party,
more of a get-together.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.695
- Oh, even better.

35:29.761 --> 35:32.631
It will be a bonding experience
for all of us.

35:32.698 --> 35:34.800
- All of us?
- Yup, the whole team.

35:34.866 --> 35:38.204
See you at 6:00,
and no glitter.

35:40.005 --> 35:43.975
- Hey, what's this?
- A dance team?

35:44.042 --> 35:45.844
But we're not dancers.

35:45.911 --> 35:47.779
- Technically, I saw you dance.

35:47.846 --> 35:52.618
You're just not a technical
dancer technically yet.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.453
- Huh?
- I'll show you.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.154
Pepper, remember when you were
playing football

35:56.222 --> 35:58.624
and you--you faked right,
you ran to the left.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.326
You did a little twist-twist,
and then you spun,

36:00.392 --> 36:01.960
and then you spiked the ball
after the touchdown?

36:02.027 --> 36:03.362
- Yeah.
- Let me see that.

36:03.429 --> 36:07.933
- Okay.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.335
- Hey!

36:09.401 --> 36:10.902
All right, all right.

36:10.969 --> 36:16.275
Jess, let me hear a little...
something.

36:20.346 --> 36:24.416
Seven, eight.

36:24.483 --> 36:26.385
Hey!

36:26.452 --> 36:29.020
See, now that was a dance.

36:29.087 --> 36:32.824
Sunnie, let me see
your best soccer move.

36:32.891 --> 36:33.992
- Okay.

36:38.764 --> 36:41.800
- Hey!
That was incredible.

36:41.867 --> 36:44.102
Jess.
- I've got it.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.246
- Hey!

36:54.313 --> 36:55.447
- I did that?

36:55.514 --> 36:57.416
- You did that.
Should we all try?

36:57.483 --> 36:58.650
all: Yeah.

37:01.253 --> 37:07.593
- Five, six, seven, eight.

37:07.659 --> 37:10.429
- Whoo!
- Hey!

37:10.496 --> 37:11.763
I wanna show you guys
this little dance

37:11.830 --> 37:13.198
that I've been working on.

37:13.265 --> 37:14.966
This is called the JoJo Jam.

37:15.033 --> 37:16.167
Here you go.

37:16.234 --> 37:20.506
You go back, forward,
pump, pump, kick,

37:20.572 --> 37:22.841
kick,
a twist, twist, slide.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.243
Hey!

37:25.311 --> 37:27.846
You see, dance is all
about expressing yourself.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.748
Everyone has
a little sparkle in them.

37:29.815 --> 37:31.583
You've just got to let it out.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.752
Jess, let's hear
a little funky beat.

37:36.955 --> 37:38.424
Hey!

37:41.327 --> 37:43.629
- Hey, let's go.
- Hey!

37:48.266 --> 37:51.537
- Hey, wait.
Why are we doing this again?

37:51.603 --> 37:52.871
- Yeah, what gives?

37:52.938 --> 37:55.541
Why do you want us to be
part of your dance team?

37:55.607 --> 37:58.744
- Well, my coach kicked me
off the team.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.479
She said that I needed
to find my sparkle switch

38:00.546 --> 38:02.414
and turn it off.

38:02.481 --> 38:05.050
And I tried.
I really did.

38:05.116 --> 38:08.454
But what can I say?
I'm sparkly.

38:10.522 --> 38:13.359
So now I'm all on my own.

38:13.425 --> 38:15.694
- No you're not I'm in.

38:15.761 --> 38:17.796
My first season,
I missed a penalty kick

38:17.863 --> 38:20.766
that could have won
my team the championship game.

38:20.832 --> 38:22.768
When I cried on the field,
my coach called me "Weepy"

38:22.834 --> 38:23.969
for the rest of the year.

38:24.035 --> 38:25.537
- In third grade, Max Cohen
said

38:25.604 --> 38:27.105
I couldn't play football
with him at lunch

38:27.172 --> 38:28.774
because he said
I played like a girl.

38:28.840 --> 38:32.411
So I practiced every day
since to prove him right.

38:32.478 --> 38:33.679
I'm in too.

38:33.745 --> 38:34.846
- My step-mom told me
cheerleading

38:34.913 --> 38:36.314
isn't a real sport,

38:36.382 --> 38:37.983
so she wouldn't let me
try out for the team,

38:38.049 --> 38:39.851
so now I make up cheers
around the house

38:39.918 --> 38:41.186
encouraging her
to cook something

38:41.252 --> 38:43.955
that actually tastes good.
I'm in too.

38:44.022 --> 38:45.657
- You know, it sounds like
we've all been told

38:45.724 --> 38:47.258
that we don't fit in before.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.696
On my last team,
we all had to be the same.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.731
What if on this team

38:52.798 --> 38:55.534
we celebrated
everyone being unique?

38:55.601 --> 38:57.736
- Yeah.

38:57.803 --> 39:00.071
all: * We put the U and I
in unified *

39:00.138 --> 39:02.140
* We put the U and I
in unique *

39:02.207 --> 39:04.309
* We put the U and I
in universe *

39:04.376 --> 39:06.745
* U and I, U and I,
U and I, hey *

39:06.812 --> 39:09.047
* We put the U and I
in unified *

39:09.114 --> 39:11.316
* We put the U and I
in unique *

39:11.383 --> 39:13.752
* We put the U and I
in universe *

39:13.819 --> 39:15.887
* U and I, U and I,
U and I hey *

39:15.954 --> 39:18.089
* You be you, I be I *

39:18.156 --> 39:21.192
* Together it's U and I,
U and I hey *

39:21.259 --> 39:23.261
* I knew from
the day we met *

39:23.328 --> 39:27.599
* What you see is what you get,
and we're not done yet *

39:27.666 --> 39:30.301
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

39:30.368 --> 39:32.771
* Get your shine on,
raise the bar *

39:32.838 --> 39:34.906
* Singing like
we're Bruno Mars *

39:34.973 --> 39:36.742
* Show 'em who we are *

39:36.808 --> 39:39.144
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

39:39.210 --> 39:41.747
* We'll stand out big
in the crowd *

39:41.813 --> 39:43.849
* One in a thousand smiles *

39:43.915 --> 39:46.652
* They'll hear us laughing
out loud *

39:46.718 --> 39:48.820
* Feel like a million miles *

39:48.887 --> 39:50.989
* And everything else
that we do *

39:51.056 --> 39:52.891
* There's nothing else
like me and you *

39:52.958 --> 39:57.128
* U and I, U and I, U and I *

39:57.195 --> 39:59.865
* We put the U and I
in unified *

39:59.931 --> 40:02.133
* We put the U and I
in unique *

40:02.200 --> 40:04.369
* We put the U and I
in universe *

40:04.436 --> 40:07.005
* U and I, U and I, U and I
hey *

40:07.072 --> 40:09.107
* We put the U and I
in unified *

40:09.174 --> 40:11.276
* We put the U and I
in unique *

40:11.342 --> 40:13.712
* We put the U and I
in universe *

40:13.779 --> 40:15.947
* U and I, U and I,
U and I *

40:16.014 --> 40:18.149
* You be you, I be I *

40:18.216 --> 40:21.152
* Together it's U and I,
U and I hey *

40:21.219 --> 40:23.388
* It's like we've always
been a crew *

40:23.455 --> 40:25.991
* Crack me up,
show me those moves *

40:26.057 --> 40:27.659
* Now we're coming through *

40:27.726 --> 40:30.529
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

40:30.596 --> 40:32.831
* Music turned up all the way *

40:32.898 --> 40:35.166
* Singing like we're Beyoncé *

40:35.233 --> 40:39.270
* Let me hear you say,
yeah, yeah, yeah *

40:39.337 --> 40:42.073
* We'll stand out big
in the crowd *

40:42.140 --> 40:43.875
* One in a thousand smiles *

40:43.942 --> 40:46.712
* They'll hear us
laughing out loud *

40:46.778 --> 40:48.780
* Feel like a million miles *

40:48.847 --> 40:50.982
* And everything else
that we do *

40:51.049 --> 40:52.951
* There's nothing else
like me and you *

40:53.018 --> 40:57.789
* U and I, U and I, U and I *

40:57.856 --> 40:59.991
* We put the U and I
in unified *

41:00.058 --> 41:02.160
* We put the U and I
in unique *

41:02.227 --> 41:04.329
* We put the U and I
in universe *

41:04.395 --> 41:06.865
* U and I, U and I,
U and I hey *

41:06.932 --> 41:09.034
* We put the U and I
in unified *

41:09.100 --> 41:11.202
* We put the U and I
in unique *

41:11.269 --> 41:13.772
* We put the U and I
in universe *

41:13.839 --> 41:15.674
* U and I, U and I,
U and I hey *

41:15.741 --> 41:18.076
* You be you, I be I *

41:18.143 --> 41:20.679
* Together it's U and I,
U and I hey *

41:23.348 --> 41:25.684
- Guys! Oh, yeah!

41:25.751 --> 41:27.352
- Who are all those people?

41:27.418 --> 41:30.155
- Looks like she found
some new friends.

41:30.221 --> 41:32.157
Are you still going to tell her
we're using her moves?

41:32.223 --> 41:33.391
- Are you still gonna
tell her

41:33.458 --> 41:35.326
that she's uninvited
to your birthday?

41:39.230 --> 41:41.432
- You guys,
we can totally do this.

41:41.499 --> 41:42.801
- Do what, exactly?

41:42.868 --> 41:45.103
- Register for the
First Position Competition.

41:45.170 --> 41:48.206
- If you finish top three,
you qualify for nationals.

41:48.273 --> 41:49.808
This year
they're in Springfield,

41:49.875 --> 41:51.810
which is just
a couple hours away.

41:51.877 --> 41:53.144
- Do you really think
we have a shot?

41:53.211 --> 41:56.047
- Judging by what I just saw,
I know we do.

41:56.114 --> 41:58.183
- Oh, my gosh!

41:58.249 --> 42:01.553
- If I tell JoJo I gave away
her moves, she could ask me

42:01.620 --> 42:04.189
to tell Coach Poppy
that she can't have them.

42:04.255 --> 42:05.757
- I'm sure that would
go over well.

42:05.824 --> 42:07.425
- And if you tell JoJo
that Coach Poppy

42:07.492 --> 42:10.929
is coming to your birthday,
she'll be nice and come anyway.

42:10.996 --> 42:13.832
- But Coach Poppy said
no glitter,

42:13.899 --> 42:16.501
and we both know
what that means.

42:16.568 --> 42:18.169
- So what do we do?

42:18.236 --> 42:20.038
- Hey, good practice,
everybody.

42:20.105 --> 42:21.807
I'll see you tomorrow.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.208
Good day, good day, good day.

42:23.274 --> 42:25.644
That was awesome. We did it.

42:25.711 --> 42:28.279
- Yeah. Hey, girls.
- Hi.

42:28.346 --> 42:29.648
- My Rubies!

42:29.715 --> 42:31.917
Man, it's good to see you guys.
Come on, come on.

42:31.983 --> 42:33.885
You gotta come in.
Check this out.

42:37.288 --> 42:41.359
- Wow, it looks great in here.
- Thanks.

42:41.426 --> 42:45.163
- It's so weird not seeing you
every day. We miss you.

42:45.230 --> 42:48.333
- I know. I miss you guys too,
but hey, at least we're gonna

42:48.399 --> 42:50.401
see each other at
the First Position Competition.

42:50.468 --> 42:52.270
- Awesome.
You're gonna come watch?

42:52.337 --> 42:56.207
- Close. I'm actually
competing with my new team.

42:56.274 --> 42:58.576
- Cool.
- So cool.

42:58.644 --> 43:00.011
- Wow, so that's your new team.

43:00.078 --> 43:01.813
I thought those were
just some new friends.

43:01.880 --> 43:04.082
- Well, I mean,
they're that too.

43:04.149 --> 43:06.885
- Bonus.
- Yay for new friends.

43:06.952 --> 43:08.419
- You guys, you're going
to love 'em.

43:08.486 --> 43:11.422
Oh, actually,
hold on one second.

43:11.489 --> 43:14.693
Sunnie, she forgot her ball,
which is so Sunnie.

43:14.760 --> 43:16.561
I'll be right back.

43:18.864 --> 43:21.532
- "Which is so Sunnie."

43:21.599 --> 43:25.070
Oh, my gosh.
I just made fun of her.

43:25.136 --> 43:28.039
Why did I do that?
I don't make fun of people.

43:28.106 --> 43:31.677
I'm a nice person,
or maybe I'm not.

43:31.743 --> 43:33.044
Maybe I'm a terrible person

43:33.111 --> 43:34.746
that doesn't want JoJo
to replace us.

43:34.813 --> 43:38.049
- All right. Take a breath.
It's perfectly normal for us

43:38.116 --> 43:40.919
to feel jealous
about her making new friends.

43:40.986 --> 43:44.155
- She looks so happy.
I don't want to tell her

43:44.222 --> 43:47.458
she can't come to my birthday
and bum her out again.

43:47.525 --> 43:49.895
- I can't believe JoJo
has got a new team.

43:49.961 --> 43:52.798
- And she's competing
against us.

43:52.864 --> 43:54.232
- Do we tell Coach Poppy?

43:54.299 --> 43:57.468
- I don't want to
bum her out either.

44:03.742 --> 44:05.143
- There she is.

44:05.210 --> 44:07.078
Ladies and gentlemen,
the girl who kicked so high

44:07.145 --> 44:09.347
in fifth grade
she gave herself a concussion.

44:09.414 --> 44:12.751
The only Jo who's so extra
she needed an extra Jo.

44:12.818 --> 44:15.821
JoJo the Baroness of Bows
is back.

44:15.887 --> 44:17.522
- Desi, you are too much,

44:17.588 --> 44:20.992
which by the way happens
to be the perfect amount.

44:21.059 --> 44:22.593
- Someone looks like
herself again.

44:22.660 --> 44:23.829
- What do you mean, my bow?

44:23.895 --> 44:25.897
- No, no, it's more
like your smile.

44:25.964 --> 44:27.398
- This old thing?

44:27.465 --> 44:29.167
- I'm glad to see you're back
to being

44:29.234 --> 44:31.336
the rainbow glitter sparkle
dream queen that you are.

44:31.402 --> 44:33.772
- I mean, you're not wrong.

44:33.839 --> 44:36.674
- So where are the Rubies
and the rest of the team?

44:36.742 --> 44:38.309
- I've got my own team now.

44:38.376 --> 44:42.080
- Remember, ladies, second
place is just first losers.

44:42.147 --> 44:45.917
First loser.
Loser.

44:45.984 --> 44:47.685
- Don't worry about her, guys.

44:47.753 --> 44:48.920
- What are you doing here?

44:48.987 --> 44:51.823
- I'm competing
with my new team.

44:51.890 --> 44:53.391
Didn't you guys tell her?

44:54.760 --> 44:58.730
-  It must have
slipped their minds.

45:01.166 --> 45:03.201
- Hey, Nina, long time no see.

45:05.603 --> 45:07.238
You guys look great,
by the way.

45:07.305 --> 45:09.040
- It's good to see you, JoJo.
You look--

45:09.107 --> 45:12.978
- Like, I don't know
what team you belong to.

45:13.044 --> 45:14.345
You guys don't even match.

45:14.412 --> 45:16.281
- That's because
we're all unique.

45:16.347 --> 45:19.584
- Cute.
So, JoJo, are you sad

45:19.650 --> 45:21.386
that you're not with
the A-Team anymore?

45:21.452 --> 45:24.823
- No 'cause now she's
on the J Team.

45:24.890 --> 45:26.057
- That's right.

45:28.259 --> 45:30.762
- I think your mom is calling.
- No, that's not my mama.

45:30.829 --> 45:32.430
- Mama, mama.

45:32.497 --> 45:34.465
- Oh, you don't know
my mother's ringtone.

45:34.532 --> 45:36.701
- Yeah, I do.
Tell her I say, "Hi."

45:36.768 --> 45:38.003
- Ooh!

45:38.069 --> 45:39.670
Mama, what?

46:04.362 --> 46:07.999
- Whoo-hoo!
Go, J Team, go!

46:20.611 --> 46:21.746
- That's our move.

46:21.813 --> 46:24.649
That human sequin
stole my choreography.

46:35.626 --> 46:38.696
Hey!

46:41.632 --> 46:43.969
- And now give it up
for The P-PAC!

46:44.035 --> 46:46.204
- All right, ladies.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

46:46.271 --> 46:48.606
I want those lines.
Hustle.

46:48.673 --> 46:50.608
- JoJo, I have
to tell you something.

46:50.675 --> 46:52.110
- Reba, will you please?

46:52.177 --> 46:55.780
- It's Ruby.
- Join the crew. Thank you.

47:25.076 --> 47:26.811
- Did I just see
what I think I saw?

47:26.878 --> 47:29.547
- Yeah, they just did
the JoJo Jam.

47:32.250 --> 47:34.219
- Are they pulling out
jump ropes?

47:34.285 --> 47:36.054
- Is that even legal?

47:55.340 --> 47:56.874
- Our third place winner,

47:56.942 --> 47:59.911
who will be continuing on
to nationals, is Troop TNT.

48:01.579 --> 48:06.017
- We're going to nationals.
Thank you. Thank you.

48:06.084 --> 48:07.218
- Guys, don't stress,
all right?

48:07.285 --> 48:08.586
We danced our hearts out.

48:08.653 --> 48:10.989
We don't need some gimmick
like jump ropes.

48:11.056 --> 48:13.558
- Second place, also headed
to the national level of

48:13.624 --> 48:16.427
the First Position Competition,
goes to

48:16.494 --> 48:20.465
The J Team!

48:20.531 --> 48:23.101
- Thank you so much!

48:23.168 --> 48:27.472
- And the regional winner of
the All-American First Position

48:27.538 --> 48:31.242
Dance Competition
goes to The P-PAC!

48:31.309 --> 48:36.714
- Whoo, yes! That's mine!
Give it to me! Oh, I won.

48:36.781 --> 48:39.517
- Congratulations.

48:39.584 --> 48:41.953
Don't think I didn't notice
you trying to steal my moves.

48:42.020 --> 48:43.588
Nice try, but it didn't work.

48:43.654 --> 48:47.292
- Your moves?
- I'm so good.

48:47.358 --> 48:49.527
This is perfect.
- Right.

48:49.594 --> 48:51.196
Good luck at nationals.

48:51.262 --> 48:53.331
- Only losers need luck, honey.

48:53.398 --> 48:55.566
Moving on!

48:58.203 --> 49:00.471
- JoJo, I can explain.
I'm so sorry.

49:00.538 --> 49:03.708
- Winners never apologize.
Moving on!

49:03.774 --> 49:05.576
Girl, when I say,
"Moving on," move it on.

49:05.643 --> 49:09.347
Come on now, child,
we move on when we win.

49:09.414 --> 49:11.849
- Guys, we did it!

49:24.329 --> 49:26.597
- JoJo, this was all my fault.

49:26.664 --> 49:27.732
- I know.

49:27.798 --> 49:30.135
- And I take
full responsibility.

49:30.201 --> 49:31.769
- You should.

49:31.836 --> 49:35.006
- And I'm pretty sure your
neighbor is calling 911 on us.

49:35.073 --> 49:37.808
Can we come in please?

49:40.211 --> 49:42.947
- Did you get the fruit shaped
like flowers I sent?

49:43.014 --> 49:44.449
- I did. Thank you.

49:44.515 --> 49:46.584
- And the flowers shaped
like fruit?

49:46.651 --> 49:47.718
- Mm-hmm.

49:47.785 --> 49:49.254
- Are you just going
to ghost us?

49:49.320 --> 49:51.189
- I've been busy.
It's nothing personal.

49:51.256 --> 49:54.292
- I don't know if you saw any
of the TikToks I tagged you in

49:54.359 --> 49:57.395
or the embroidered pillow
I had sent over.

49:57.462 --> 49:59.264
- You really can find anything
on the Internet.

50:01.666 --> 50:03.268
- Like the pillow says,

50:03.334 --> 50:05.603
"I didn't offer
your moves to Poppy.

50:05.670 --> 50:08.073
"She saw me doing them
and then put it in the routine

50:08.139 --> 50:09.707
because she loved it,"

50:09.774 --> 50:12.843
partly because
it's great choreography

50:12.910 --> 50:16.314
and partly because
I'm such a skilled dancer.

50:19.717 --> 50:23.488
- I mean, do you know
how it felt to see my moves

50:23.554 --> 50:26.257
in the hands of the coach
that kicked me off the team?

50:26.324 --> 50:28.293
- We are terrible,
terrible people.

50:28.359 --> 50:31.529
- I know I should have told her
that she couldn't have them,

50:31.596 --> 50:35.700
but she scares me,
and for a split second,

50:35.766 --> 50:38.336
it felt like
she almost liked me.

50:38.403 --> 50:40.071
- I get it.

50:40.138 --> 50:42.907
I threw away my first bow
to try and get her to like me.

50:44.342 --> 50:45.710
Guys, we can't let Coach Poppy

50:45.776 --> 50:48.779
or anyone come
between us, okay?

50:48.846 --> 50:51.082
- Okay.
- It's a deal.

50:51.149 --> 50:52.650
- I miss you guys.

50:52.717 --> 50:56.020
I'm so excited to party
at your birthday on Saturday.

50:56.087 --> 50:58.989
- Actually, I wanted to talk
to you about that.

50:59.056 --> 51:00.958
- What?

51:01.025 --> 51:03.928
What is it?
We're still hanging out, right?

51:03.994 --> 51:06.297
- Our practice schedule
is so crazy right now,

51:06.364 --> 51:10.000
I just think we should postpone
until after nationals.

51:10.067 --> 51:12.803
- What? No way. No.

51:12.870 --> 51:14.405
- All of us are under
so much pressure.

51:14.472 --> 51:16.541
It's just not the right time
for my birthday.

51:16.607 --> 51:18.109
- Not the right time?
Are you kidding?

51:18.176 --> 51:21.112
It's your sweet 16.
We've got to do something.

51:21.179 --> 51:22.613
- It's not a big deal.

51:22.680 --> 51:26.251
Seriously, we'll party
after the competition.

51:30.521 --> 51:33.858
- Okay, I'm going
to get a picture.

51:33.924 --> 51:36.327
Yes.
- That was awesome.

51:36.394 --> 51:38.028
The lights,
the crowd, the energy.

51:38.095 --> 51:39.564
- Yeah.

51:39.630 --> 51:41.832
- You think that was awesome,
just wait until nationals.

51:41.899 --> 51:44.169
- Who knew second place
could feel this good?

51:44.235 --> 51:45.670
- Hey, we made top three.

51:45.736 --> 51:48.105
We get to move on.
That's all that matters.

51:48.173 --> 51:49.574
- I'll tell you what matters.

51:49.640 --> 51:51.476
That Poppy person
needs to be put in her place.

51:51.542 --> 51:53.178
- Yeah, I second that.
She is not cool.

51:53.244 --> 51:56.080
- Agreed. Part of me
wants to win at nationals

51:56.147 --> 51:58.216
just to see her face.

51:58.283 --> 51:59.984
I think we can do it.

52:00.050 --> 52:01.486
- Look, you all did well,

52:01.552 --> 52:03.521
but if you really want a chance
to win at nationals--

52:03.588 --> 52:05.156
- And squash Poppy's dreams.

52:05.223 --> 52:06.357
- That too.

52:06.424 --> 52:08.593
- Then we'll do
whatever it takes.

52:08.659 --> 52:10.828
- Okay. Well, here's the thing,

52:10.895 --> 52:12.930
it's not enough
to do your best.

52:12.997 --> 52:15.966
You really need
to push yourselves further.

52:16.033 --> 52:18.569
You can't just dance
with your body.

52:18.636 --> 52:20.638
You've got to dance
with your soul.

52:20.705 --> 52:23.908
- Wait, did we learn that move?
- It's not a move.

52:23.974 --> 52:26.010
It's a feeling.

52:26.076 --> 52:27.312
Do you ever have that feeling
in your gut

52:27.378 --> 52:29.547
when you wanted
something so bad

52:29.614 --> 52:31.115
and everyone told you
you can't have it?

52:31.182 --> 52:32.583
- I think she means like
when you're in overtime

52:32.650 --> 52:34.051
in the finals

52:34.118 --> 52:35.920
and you see the other team
starting to celebrate,

52:35.986 --> 52:37.888
so you decide to school them
with a penalty kick that lands

52:37.955 --> 52:40.758
with the sweet sound of you
ruining that pizza party

52:40.825 --> 52:42.360
they thought
they were about to just have.

52:42.427 --> 52:45.863
- Oh, why didn't you
just say that?

52:45.930 --> 52:47.832
- Are you guys ready for this?
- Yeah.

52:47.898 --> 52:50.435
- 'Cause we're about to go
to the next level.

52:50.501 --> 52:52.237
J Team on three.

52:52.303 --> 52:53.504
One, two, three.

52:53.571 --> 52:55.139
all: J Team!

52:56.707 --> 52:59.109
- Hey, thanks for coming
on such short notice.

52:59.176 --> 53:01.379
I'm a big fan of your work.

53:01.446 --> 53:03.381
Whoa, it's like looking
in a mirror.

53:03.448 --> 53:05.316
this thing is oddly realistic.

53:05.383 --> 53:07.285
You're very talented.
Hold up, I've gotta go get

53:07.352 --> 53:12.056
the birthday girl to see this.

53:16.527 --> 53:18.763
Sounds like someone's home.

53:22.400 --> 53:27.638
- Surprise! Happy sweet 16.

53:29.707 --> 53:31.442
You're having a party.

53:31.509 --> 53:33.911
- More of a get-together.

53:36.180 --> 53:38.249
- Without me.

53:38.316 --> 53:42.520
- I thought everybody was here.
Is that the pizza guy? Oh.

53:42.587 --> 53:45.556
- Yeah.

53:45.623 --> 53:48.125
It's just the pizza guy.

53:48.192 --> 53:49.260
- JoJo, wait.

53:49.327 --> 53:51.128
- Happy birthday.

53:57.335 --> 54:00.438
- How you doing?

54:00.505 --> 54:03.207
- Okay.
- Really?

54:03.274 --> 54:05.209
It seems like you've got the
weight of the world

54:05.276 --> 54:08.546
on your shoulders.

54:08.613 --> 54:11.649
- Kind of feels like somebody
put my heart

54:11.716 --> 54:14.452
in a blender and hit puree.

54:14.519 --> 54:17.555
- Ouch.

54:17.622 --> 54:20.591
- I think I lost my best
friends.

54:20.658 --> 54:23.761
One of them stole my moves,
and...

54:26.897 --> 54:31.302
the other,
she had a party without me.

54:31.369 --> 54:33.571
- I'm so sorry.

54:33.638 --> 54:36.507
- I thought I knew them
so well.

54:36.574 --> 54:37.775
I know that Ruby D.

54:37.842 --> 54:40.845
isn't capable of staying up
past 10,

54:40.911 --> 54:44.382
and I know that she has
an irrational fear of frogs.

54:44.449 --> 54:47.885
- Frogs?
- Right. And Ruby M.,

54:47.952 --> 54:51.422
I know that she has
a secret crush on her neighbor,

54:51.489 --> 54:54.892
and I also could tell you
exactly how she orders pizza,

54:54.959 --> 54:57.628
pepperoni,
pineapple, no cheese.

54:57.695 --> 55:00.798
- No cheese?
- Exactly.

55:00.865 --> 55:05.603
So how is it that I know
so much about these girls,

55:08.005 --> 55:09.407
but I never could
have predicted

55:09.474 --> 55:12.276
they would do this to me?

55:12.343 --> 55:16.947
- Oh, come here. Oh.

55:17.014 --> 55:20.451
- How they betrayed me
feels awful,

55:20.518 --> 55:23.521
and it makes me not want to be
friends with them anymore,

55:23.588 --> 55:30.595
but then I think about not
having them in my life, and--

55:30.661 --> 55:32.930
and that feels worse.

55:35.299 --> 55:41.238
- You know, sometimes friends
outgrow each other,

55:41.305 --> 55:43.941
and that's okay,

55:44.008 --> 55:48.479
but try to understand
what was in their hearts

55:48.546 --> 55:50.448
and at least
consider forgiveness

55:50.515 --> 55:53.451
before you walk away.

55:53.518 --> 55:56.721
People make mistakes.

55:56.787 --> 55:58.222
- It was all just
so much easier

55:58.288 --> 56:02.292
when we were at the old studio
and you were our coach.

56:02.359 --> 56:03.861
Now with my own team, I--

56:03.928 --> 56:08.633
I'm just afraid
I'm going to let everyone down.

56:08.699 --> 56:12.937
- No way.
You are a born leader, JoJo.

56:13.003 --> 56:14.739
- Am I?
- Yes.

56:14.805 --> 56:16.807
- I just keep thinking
about nationals,

56:16.874 --> 56:18.676
and I keep feeling
all this pressure.

56:18.743 --> 56:21.779
Pressure to come up
with something different

56:21.846 --> 56:23.213
to set us apart
from everyone else.

56:23.280 --> 56:26.383
You know, Coach Poppy,
she busted out jump ropes,

56:26.451 --> 56:29.820
and that really seemed
to wow the judges.

56:29.887 --> 56:33.323
- Yeah, well, she's a doozy,
all right.

56:33.390 --> 56:35.192
- I just feel like we need
something,

56:35.259 --> 56:38.929
something different to show
them how special we really are.

56:40.998 --> 56:43.200
- I want you to
close your eyes.

56:44.502 --> 56:48.539
Go on.

56:48.606 --> 56:50.875
Now I want you to envision

56:50.941 --> 56:53.410
what your ultimate dream
performance would be.

56:55.279 --> 56:58.516
- My ultimate
dream performance.

56:58.583 --> 57:00.951
My ultimate dream performance.

57:04.622 --> 57:06.924
Singing.

57:06.991 --> 57:09.760
It's always been my dream.

57:09.827 --> 57:12.129
In my ultimate dream
performance,

57:12.196 --> 57:14.532
it would be
dancing and singing.

57:14.599 --> 57:16.867
- In front of a huge audience?

57:16.934 --> 57:19.537
- How did you know?

57:19.604 --> 57:22.306
I was a kid just like you.

57:22.372 --> 57:26.043
- Too bad it's only
a dance competition.

57:26.110 --> 57:28.479
- Is it?

57:28.546 --> 57:31.181
I mean, just because everybody
is doing things one way

57:31.248 --> 57:33.851
doesn't mean
it's the right way for you.

57:35.385 --> 57:37.822
- But what if they
disqualify me

57:37.888 --> 57:40.658
for doing things differently?

57:40.725 --> 57:44.762
- Well, at least you gave them
your dream performance.

57:51.435 --> 57:54.539
- Guys, I got a big idea
for nationals,

57:54.605 --> 57:56.774
but no risk, no reward.

57:56.841 --> 57:58.943
Are y'all with me?
all: Yeah.

57:59.009 --> 58:01.045
- Heck yeah! J Team on three!

58:01.111 --> 58:03.781
One, two, three!
all: J Team!

58:06.784 --> 58:08.553
- Five, six, seven, eight.

58:13.090 --> 58:17.061
Awesome day, everybody.
J Team, whoo!

58:17.127 --> 58:18.863
- You guys are looking great.

58:18.929 --> 58:20.330
- Thank you.

59:00.270 --> 59:03.040
- JoJo!
- Whoa! Y'all scared me.

59:03.107 --> 59:06.476
- Sorry. We didn't want
to go in because--

59:08.145 --> 59:12.282
- What are you guys doing here?
Need some more moves?

59:12.349 --> 59:14.251
Or are you here to
uninvite me to something else?

59:17.688 --> 59:20.524
Sorry, I thought that was going
to feel better than it did.

59:25.195 --> 59:27.331
- I feel awful about
what I did on my birthday.

59:27.397 --> 59:28.833
- I know.

59:28.899 --> 59:33.671
I got your texts and snaps,
DMs, PMs--

59:33.738 --> 59:35.539
218 to be exact.

59:35.606 --> 59:37.541
- Coach Poppy invited herself
to my party,

59:37.608 --> 59:39.576
and I was too scared
to uninvite her

59:39.644 --> 59:43.814
so instead I uninvited you.

59:43.881 --> 59:46.383
- It's all right, Ruby.

59:46.450 --> 59:47.718
- It is?

59:47.785 --> 59:50.020
- Yeah. Friends outgrow
each other all the time.

59:50.087 --> 59:51.488
- No, JoJo, please.

59:51.555 --> 59:53.691
- We were supposed to be
friends forever,

59:53.758 --> 59:54.725
apart or together.

59:54.792 --> 59:56.694
- We are.

59:56.761 --> 59:59.630
- We were.

59:59.697 --> 1:00:01.165
- Practicing your JoJo Jam?
- Oh, come on.

1:00:01.231 --> 1:00:02.900
I've been practicing all week.

1:00:02.967 --> 1:00:06.036
- You're right.
We messed up bad,

1:00:08.773 --> 1:00:10.207
and I'll understand

1:00:10.274 --> 1:00:12.509
if you never want
to be friends with us again.

1:00:12.576 --> 1:00:14.645
- Good, great, terrific.

1:00:20.818 --> 1:00:22.319
- Where did you get that?

1:00:22.386 --> 1:00:24.488
- We took it out of the trash
and saved it.

1:00:24.554 --> 1:00:28.158
The three of us are a team.
We always have been,

1:00:28.225 --> 1:00:30.695
and we need to be
on the same team again.

1:00:30.761 --> 1:00:33.731
- We want you to come back.

1:00:33.798 --> 1:00:35.833
- Am I missing something here?

1:00:35.900 --> 1:00:37.868
It's Coach Poppy
who calls the shots.

1:00:37.935 --> 1:00:40.004
- She wants you back
on the team, too.

1:00:40.070 --> 1:00:42.472
She said she made
a huge mistake.

1:00:42.539 --> 1:00:44.842
- Coach Poppy wants me back
on the team?

1:00:44.909 --> 1:00:46.911
- We all do. The whole team.

1:00:46.977 --> 1:00:50.414
Even Nina said the team's not
the same without your sparkle.

1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:51.682
We'll do anything

1:00:51.749 --> 1:00:54.084
if you'll just come back
and dance with us again.

1:00:54.151 --> 1:00:55.319
- Come on. Let's get out of
here.

1:00:55.385 --> 1:00:59.189
- Wait.
Maybe it's not what we think.

1:01:08.598 --> 1:01:10.835
- My team does need
a lot of work.

1:01:10.901 --> 1:01:13.037
- Let's go.

1:01:13.103 --> 1:01:15.740
- But I made a commitment
to them.

1:01:15.806 --> 1:01:17.207
- And Coach Poppy was right.

1:01:17.274 --> 1:01:19.844
I do not belong in the P-PAC.

1:01:19.910 --> 1:01:23.347
I'm me, and I like
bows and sparkles

1:01:23.413 --> 1:01:25.850
and being exactly who I am.

1:01:25.916 --> 1:01:27.317
And letting my team know

1:01:27.384 --> 1:01:30.054
that they should be
exactly who they want to be.

1:01:31.455 --> 1:01:33.523
- Do you think there's a way
we can still be friends?

1:01:33.590 --> 1:01:39.897
- Maybe, but I'm still sad,
and hurt.

1:01:39.964 --> 1:01:41.131
But we can try.

1:01:41.198 --> 1:01:42.532
- We'll take it.

1:01:42.599 --> 1:01:46.070
And we promise we'll never
betray your trust again.

1:02:02.186 --> 1:02:06.791
- Oh. Well, did--
did you get her back?

1:02:06.857 --> 1:02:09.693
- Um. No.

1:02:11.261 --> 1:02:14.364
She said she doesn't want to
come back and be on the team.

1:02:16.033 --> 1:02:19.403
-  Good.

1:02:19.469 --> 1:02:21.238
- Good?

1:02:21.305 --> 1:02:24.074
- Well, yeah. Oh, come on.
You didn't actually think

1:02:24.141 --> 1:02:25.876
she was going to
leave her team, did you?

1:02:29.613 --> 1:02:32.482
Oh, cute! You did.

1:02:32.549 --> 1:02:35.219
- Well, then why did you ask us
to go get her back?

1:02:35.285 --> 1:02:37.121
- Because I wanted to poke
a few holes in that pesky

1:02:37.187 --> 1:02:38.923
self-confidence of hers.
You know.

1:02:38.989 --> 1:02:40.724
Make her wonder whether
she made the right choice,

1:02:40.791 --> 1:02:43.127
and hopefully drive a wedge
between her and her team

1:02:43.193 --> 1:02:45.162
as a bonus.

1:02:45.229 --> 1:02:46.763
We can't risk her winning.

1:02:46.831 --> 1:02:50.835
- You sent us to sabotage
our friend's team?

1:02:50.901 --> 1:02:53.503
- You used us.

1:02:53.570 --> 1:02:56.807
- Well, duh!

1:02:56.874 --> 1:03:01.178
I told you we were
going to win the nationals.

1:03:01.245 --> 1:03:03.647
And we will.

1:03:05.983 --> 1:03:08.218
- Hey, guys. What's the deal?

1:03:08.285 --> 1:03:09.786
Nationals are just
a few days away.

1:03:09.854 --> 1:03:11.288
- What do you care?

1:03:11.355 --> 1:03:13.223
Don't you have another team
to go practice with now?

1:03:13.290 --> 1:03:14.658
- What are you talking about?

1:03:14.724 --> 1:03:18.328
- Your old team,
who doesn't need so much work.

1:03:18.395 --> 1:03:19.930
We know you're
going back to them.

1:03:19.997 --> 1:03:22.166
We saw you with them
at Val's house this morning.

1:03:22.232 --> 1:03:23.968
- Who? The Ruby's?
- Yeah.

1:03:24.034 --> 1:03:25.469
The girls who stole your moves.

1:03:25.535 --> 1:03:27.237
- And didn't invite you
to their party.

1:03:27.304 --> 1:03:28.873
- Look.
I know they messed up,

1:03:28.939 --> 1:03:31.241
but they're my friends, too.

1:03:31.308 --> 1:03:33.777
People make mistakes.
- Yeah, we know.

1:03:33.844 --> 1:03:36.646
Just like the mistake we made
wasting our time on the J-Team.

1:03:36.713 --> 1:03:38.215
- No, no, no.
Just hear me out, please.

1:03:38.282 --> 1:03:41.018
- Go ahead.
Go running off to your friends.

1:03:41.085 --> 1:03:42.486
Don't worry about us.

1:03:42.552 --> 1:03:45.322
- Yeah.
We'll make it easy for you.

1:03:45.389 --> 1:03:46.891
We quit the J-Team.

1:03:46.957 --> 1:03:49.459
- Jess. Pepper. Sunnie.

1:03:49.526 --> 1:03:53.197
Guys, just hear me out. Wait.

1:04:03.307 --> 1:04:06.510
- No thanks.
I'm not in the mood.

1:04:09.613 --> 1:04:12.049
Any of the J-Team
answer your calls?

1:04:12.116 --> 1:04:15.519
- Not yet,
but I'll keep trying.

1:04:15.585 --> 1:04:19.890
- How did I get here?
I have no team to perform with,

1:04:19.957 --> 1:04:23.193
but even worse,
I let all of my friends down.

1:04:23.260 --> 1:04:25.896
- JoJo.
- I never meant to hurt anyone.

1:04:25.963 --> 1:04:27.231
- I know that.

1:04:27.297 --> 1:04:30.867
- All I ever wanted to do
is perform.

1:04:30.935 --> 1:04:37.274
But, now I feel like the
universe is telling me not to.

1:04:37.341 --> 1:04:41.778
Do I just listen
and give it all up?

1:04:41.845 --> 1:04:46.783
- Do you remember that day
I gave you your first bow.

1:04:46.850 --> 1:04:49.619
You were so upset you couldn't
nail your triple pirouette

1:04:49.686 --> 1:04:53.090
you wanted to quit.

1:04:53.157 --> 1:04:55.059
But once you had that bow
in your hair

1:04:55.125 --> 1:04:57.527
and the music started,

1:04:57.594 --> 1:04:59.696
there was no stopping you.

1:04:59.763 --> 1:05:01.565
- I think I practiced all day
and night

1:05:01.631 --> 1:05:03.767
until I wore a hole
in my kitchen floor.

1:05:03.833 --> 1:05:07.604
- I remember.
Nothing's changed.

1:05:07.671 --> 1:05:10.840
If you really want to perform,

1:05:10.907 --> 1:05:13.743
nothing will stop you.

1:05:33.998 --> 1:05:37.367
* One day I'm circling
the stratosphere *

1:05:37.434 --> 1:05:40.870
* Next day I've hit
the ground *

1:05:40.937 --> 1:05:44.608
* Why should I believe
that I can win *

1:05:44.674 --> 1:05:48.212
* I've been lost
in the clouds *

1:05:48.278 --> 1:05:50.114
* I'm just trying to keep up *

1:05:50.180 --> 1:05:51.715
* Always trying to be what *

1:05:51.781 --> 1:05:55.185
* Everyone expects of me *

1:05:55.252 --> 1:05:57.187
* I know it isn't hopeless *

1:05:57.254 --> 1:05:58.755
* I just need to focus *

1:05:58.822 --> 1:06:01.325
* On bringing back
the best of me *

1:06:01.391 --> 1:06:02.426
* When lights go down *

1:06:02.492 --> 1:06:05.229
* And spark goes out *

1:06:05.295 --> 1:06:08.365
* It's just me at the mirror
with my mistakes *

1:06:08.432 --> 1:06:10.334
* And the girl I see *

1:06:10.400 --> 1:06:12.002
* Staring back at me *

1:06:12.069 --> 1:06:15.439
* She's trying to remind me
that I've still got strength *

1:06:15.505 --> 1:06:20.377
* It's like I've got the weight
of the world on my shoulders *

1:06:20.444 --> 1:06:22.479
* Questions dancing through
my mind *

1:06:22.546 --> 1:06:24.648
* When the lights go down *

1:06:24.714 --> 1:06:26.483
* And the spark goes out *

1:06:26.550 --> 1:06:28.918
* I can't forget about her *

1:06:28.985 --> 1:06:32.022
* I've got to get back
to that girl *

1:06:38.228 --> 1:06:40.097
* So free *

1:06:40.164 --> 1:06:41.498
* Spinning with the courage *

1:06:41.565 --> 1:06:43.433
* To break free *

1:06:43.500 --> 1:06:45.402
From all of the noise

1:06:45.469 --> 1:06:46.936
Might fall

1:06:47.003 --> 1:06:49.173
* But every move
is beautiful *

1:06:49.239 --> 1:06:50.707
* Graceful *

1:06:50.774 --> 1:06:54.511
* True to that voice
I don't need to keep up *

1:06:54.578 --> 1:06:56.413
* I just need to be what *

1:06:56.480 --> 1:06:59.783
* Everyone expects of me *

1:06:59.849 --> 1:07:03.320
* I can see what hope is
I just need to focus *

1:07:03.387 --> 1:07:05.655
* On bringing back
the best of me *

1:07:05.722 --> 1:07:07.023
* When the lights go down *

1:07:07.091 --> 1:07:09.926
* And spark goes out *

1:07:09.993 --> 1:07:12.996
* It's just me at the mirror
with my mistakes *

1:07:13.063 --> 1:07:14.298
* And the girl I see *

1:07:14.364 --> 1:07:15.699
* Staring back at me *

1:07:15.765 --> 1:07:17.367
* And the girl I see
Staring back at me *

1:07:17.434 --> 1:07:20.003
* She's trying to remind me
that I've still got strength *

1:07:20.070 --> 1:07:24.774
* It's like I've got the weight
of the world on my shoulders *

1:07:24.841 --> 1:07:26.310
* Questions dancing through
my mind *

1:07:26.376 --> 1:07:28.745
* When the lights go down *

1:07:28.812 --> 1:07:31.081
* And the spark goes out *

1:07:31.148 --> 1:07:33.517
* I can't forget about her *

1:07:33.583 --> 1:07:37.221
* I've got to get back
to that girl *

1:08:02.512 --> 1:08:05.014
- Ha. Well, well, well.

1:08:05.081 --> 1:08:06.350
Look what we have here.

1:08:06.416 --> 1:08:09.119
It's JoJo, everybody.
What does she have on?

1:08:09.186 --> 1:08:10.520
- Hey, guys.

1:08:10.587 --> 1:08:11.955
- You know, I was really bummed
to hear

1:08:12.021 --> 1:08:15.192
that you didn't want
to come back and join us.

1:08:15.259 --> 1:08:17.227
Where's the rest of the J-Team.

1:08:17.294 --> 1:08:20.197
- Oh. It's just me
that'll be competing today.

1:08:20.264 --> 1:08:22.899
The rest of my team quit.

1:08:22.966 --> 1:08:26.170
- Oh.
I'm really sorry to hear that.

1:08:26.236 --> 1:08:27.737
- Thanks.

1:08:27.804 --> 1:08:30.574
- It's okay, though, because
I'm still going to perform.

1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:31.908
I love performing.

1:08:31.975 --> 1:08:34.043
My favorite thing, ever.
Nothing can stop me.

1:08:34.110 --> 1:08:36.880
- Cute. Good luck with that.
Moving on!

1:08:44.654 --> 1:08:48.425
- And now, the P-PAC!

1:08:54.631 --> 1:08:56.833
- We're about to start.
Where are the Rubies?

1:08:56.900 --> 1:08:59.569
- I don't know. I've looked
for them everywhere.

1:08:59.636 --> 1:09:01.571
What are you doing here?
You should be on the stage.

1:09:01.638 --> 1:09:03.773
Go back out there, Sheena.
- It's Nina!

1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:08.077
- Sheena be working my nerves.
I swear I ain't gonna let her.

1:10:07.704 --> 1:10:08.805
- Ha ha!
- The Ruby's parts

1:10:08.872 --> 1:10:10.206
are coming up.
- I know. Hold this.

1:10:10.274 --> 1:10:11.541
Turn around.

1:10:11.608 --> 1:10:13.042
I've got to put this on me
for one second.

1:10:13.109 --> 1:10:14.411
You know what? You're going
to have to cover for them.

1:10:14.478 --> 1:10:15.345
- But I don't know their parts.
- Yeah, yeah.

1:10:15.412 --> 1:10:16.846
The show must go on, Trina.

1:10:16.913 --> 1:10:18.114
- Nina!
- Who cares.

1:10:18.181 --> 1:10:20.650
- My part isn't over!

1:10:23.620 --> 1:10:27.757
- Yeah, Honey!
That is my girl--

1:10:27.824 --> 1:10:29.259
Get me down! Get me down!

1:10:29.326 --> 1:10:31.595
Ahh! What's your name?
What's your name? Help me!

1:10:31.661 --> 1:10:35.799
Help me! Oh!
Ooh! Ooh!

1:10:35.865 --> 1:10:38.134
- That was unexpected.

1:10:38.201 --> 1:10:41.237
- I always knew she had
a little sparkle on the inside.

1:10:46.443 --> 1:10:49.212
- Well, you're next, kid.

1:10:49.279 --> 1:10:52.582
- Val. I don't know if I can
do it. Not alone.

1:10:52.649 --> 1:10:54.150
- Yes, you can.

1:10:54.217 --> 1:10:55.919
- But it's a team competition,
and we're--

1:10:55.985 --> 1:10:58.855
- Listen. None of that matters.

1:10:58.922 --> 1:11:00.990
Winning isn't the goal anymore.

1:11:01.057 --> 1:11:04.761
- And now, please welcome
The J-Team.

1:11:04.828 --> 1:11:07.130
- You remember that ultimate

1:11:07.196 --> 1:11:09.299
performance you imagined?

1:11:09.366 --> 1:11:13.537
Your only goal now
is to go out there and do it.

1:11:13.603 --> 1:11:16.205
Just live your dream.

1:11:16.272 --> 1:11:20.744
- Just live my dream.

1:11:20.810 --> 1:11:27.050
- We love you J-Team!

1:11:27.116 --> 1:11:30.920
* Nobody
no, no, nobody, no *

1:11:30.987 --> 1:11:34.591
* Nobody can change me *

1:11:34.658 --> 1:11:37.561
* Nobody

1:11:37.627 --> 1:11:39.763

1:11:42.065 --> 1:11:45.535

1:11:45.602 --> 1:11:48.905
* Not just gonna listen,
woah-oh *

1:11:48.972 --> 1:11:52.175
* I'm doing my own thing *

1:11:52.241 --> 1:11:55.545
* And it's a real
good feeling *

1:11:55.612 --> 1:11:56.680

* I feel everything *

1:12:02.452 --> 1:12:03.587
* My life *

1:12:03.653 --> 1:12:06.155
* I choose who to be *

1:12:06.222 --> 1:12:09.593
* So I'ma be me *

1:12:09.659 --> 1:12:12.596
* I wear my heart
on my sleeve *

1:12:12.662 --> 1:12:13.963
* Won't hide *

1:12:14.030 --> 1:12:15.899
* I am who you see *

1:12:15.965 --> 1:12:19.168
* I wear my heart
on my sleeve, now *

1:12:19.235 --> 1:12:24.808
* Nobody can change me
nobody, no, no *

1:12:24.874 --> 1:12:27.544
* Nobody, no
nobody, no, no *

1:12:27.611 --> 1:12:29.746

1:12:33.282 --> 1:12:36.319
* Change me *

1:12:36.386 --> 1:12:39.756
* I follow my own lead *

1:12:39.823 --> 1:12:41.891
* Once you get to know me *

1:12:41.958 --> 1:12:46.262
* You'll see
got all these emotions *

1:12:46.329 --> 1:12:48.732
* They're guiding
every moment *

1:12:48.798 --> 1:12:50.567
* My life *

1:12:50.634 --> 1:12:51.735
* My rules *

1:12:51.801 --> 1:12:52.936
* My dreams *

1:12:53.002 --> 1:12:55.271
* It's real
I feel everything *

1:12:55.338 --> 1:13:00.243

* Change me *

1:13:29.806 --> 1:13:32.976
* The world can
try to stop me *

1:13:33.042 --> 1:13:36.780
* Just watch me try to care *

1:13:36.846 --> 1:13:39.048

1:14:07.110 --> 1:14:09.479
* Hey, hey, hey
Let's hear it, J-Team *

1:14:09.546 --> 1:14:10.847
* Let's go *

1:14:10.914 --> 1:14:14.150
* I wear my heart

1:14:14.217 --> 1:14:17.721
* Won't hide
I am who you see *

1:14:17.787 --> 1:14:20.690
* I wear my heart

1:14:20.757 --> 1:14:24.528
* No, nobody can change me *

1:14:24.594 --> 1:14:26.195
* Nobody, no, no *

1:14:26.262 --> 1:14:29.332
* Nobody, no
Nobody, no, no *

1:14:29.398 --> 1:14:33.002
* Nobody, no, no

1:14:33.069 --> 1:14:37.206
* Nobody can change me *
change me

1:14:37.273 --> 1:14:40.443
* The world can
try to stop me *

1:14:40.510 --> 1:14:44.113
* But I'm already here *

1:14:44.180 --> 1:14:46.650
* Yeah
nobody, no, no *

1:14:46.716 --> 1:14:49.986
* Nobody, no
Nobody, no, no *

1:14:50.053 --> 1:14:53.056
* Nobody, no, no
Nobody, no, no *

1:14:53.122 --> 1:14:57.961
* Nobody can change me
change me *

1:15:06.903 --> 1:15:08.738
- What made you guys
change your mind?

1:15:08.805 --> 1:15:10.373
- The Rubies told us
everything.

1:15:10.439 --> 1:15:12.375
- We should have listened to
you when you tried to explain.

1:15:12.441 --> 1:15:14.611
- We just assumed you'd want
to go back to your old team,

1:15:14.678 --> 1:15:17.480
because you'd have
a better chance at winning.

1:15:17.547 --> 1:15:19.115
- Are you kidding me?

1:15:19.182 --> 1:15:22.518
Whatever the result of this
competition, I already won.

1:15:22.586 --> 1:15:24.453
- Pardon me. Make way.
Coming through.

1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:26.656
Hi.
I need to speak to a manager.

1:15:26.723 --> 1:15:28.625
How very dare of you
to put the rest of us to shame.

1:15:28.692 --> 1:15:29.993
Why do we even bother.

1:15:30.059 --> 1:15:32.528
- Aw, stop it Desi.
Your team was amazing.

1:15:32.596 --> 1:15:34.598
What I want to know
is how you did that one move.

1:15:34.664 --> 1:15:37.166
The one where you're like
"bam, oomf, cappa."

1:15:38.501 --> 1:15:40.369
- That's the JoJo Jam.
- Of course it is.

1:15:40.436 --> 1:15:42.171
I demand you teach it
to me ASAP.

1:15:42.238 --> 1:15:44.908
- Anything for you, my friend.
- I knew her first, girls.

1:15:49.378 --> 1:15:51.781
- Here you go, Jess.
- Woah!

1:15:51.848 --> 1:15:55.384
- Yeah!

1:15:57.954 --> 1:16:00.289
- And Pepper,
this bow is for you,

1:16:00.356 --> 1:16:03.727
'cause it's spicy,
just like you are.

1:16:03.793 --> 1:16:07.096
- Oh, yeah.

1:16:07.163 --> 1:16:08.965
- Each one of these bows
is unique.

1:16:09.032 --> 1:16:10.834
Just like all of you.

1:16:10.900 --> 1:16:13.770
It represents
how we're all different,

1:16:13.837 --> 1:16:16.740
but we're all on the same team.

1:16:16.806 --> 1:16:20.476
- Congrats, J-Team.
- Yeah, you guys were awesome.

1:16:20.543 --> 1:16:22.979
- Did Poppy kick you
off the team?

1:16:23.046 --> 1:16:24.648
- She tried to,
but we quit first.

1:16:24.714 --> 1:16:25.949
- Mm-hmm.

1:16:26.015 --> 1:16:28.151
- Well, technically
she kicked us off

1:16:28.217 --> 1:16:30.654
while we were quitting,
but that's besides the point.

1:16:30.720 --> 1:16:31.955
- It was mutual.

1:16:32.021 --> 1:16:34.390
- JoJo. We wanted ask--

1:16:34.457 --> 1:16:36.125
and it's cool
if you want to say no,

1:16:36.192 --> 1:16:38.862
we'll totally understand.

1:16:38.928 --> 1:16:40.997
- Can we be on the J-Team?

1:16:45.134 --> 1:16:47.403
- Well, since we are on our way

1:16:47.470 --> 1:16:49.538
to the First
Position Competition

1:16:49.605 --> 1:16:54.477
World Championships.

1:16:54.543 --> 1:16:58.447
- I think we could use a few
extra J-Team ladies.

1:17:00.917 --> 1:17:03.386
- All right, you guys.
We've got a lot of work to do.

1:17:03.452 --> 1:17:05.254
so we should get started
right away.

1:17:05.321 --> 1:17:06.656
are you guys warmed up.

1:17:06.723 --> 1:17:07.991
all: Yes.

1:17:08.057 --> 1:17:10.393
- Good, 'cause it's time
to party!

1:17:17.266 --> 1:17:18.467
* Every day is different *

1:17:18.534 --> 1:17:20.403
* But my dream
is still the same *

1:17:20.469 --> 1:17:21.971
* Every day I wake up saying *

1:17:22.038 --> 1:17:23.472
* Let's go win the game *

1:17:23.539 --> 1:17:24.941
* Something's
gonna happen here *

1:17:25.008 --> 1:17:26.575
* But I don't know what it is *

1:17:26.642 --> 1:17:28.144
* Something's
gonna happen here *

1:17:28.211 --> 1:17:30.379
* And I think it's really big,
'cause *

1:17:30.446 --> 1:17:32.916
* All I ever wanted
was to see the world *

1:17:32.982 --> 1:17:34.684
* High up in the sky *

1:17:34.751 --> 1:17:36.619
* Hop on a plane like *

1:17:36.686 --> 1:17:38.755
* All the stars that
I would always see *

1:17:38.822 --> 1:17:40.156
* On TV *

1:17:40.223 --> 1:17:42.491
* I believed that I would be
like them *

1:17:42.558 --> 1:17:44.060
* See my face on the screen *

1:17:44.127 --> 1:17:45.528
* See my name in the lights *

1:17:45.594 --> 1:17:47.063
* Got to focus
on your passion *

1:17:47.130 --> 1:17:48.264
* If you want to get it right *

1:17:48.331 --> 1:17:49.665
* Got to work real hard *

1:17:49.733 --> 1:17:51.034
* To have the life *

1:17:51.100 --> 1:17:54.370
* Ever since I was little
I would D-R-E-A-M *

1:17:54.437 --> 1:17:55.939
* You can do it if you see it *

1:17:56.005 --> 1:17:57.273
* If you see it you can be it *

1:17:57.340 --> 1:17:58.875
* You believe it
you achieve it *

1:17:58.942 --> 1:18:00.343
* You just D-R-E-A-M *

1:18:00.409 --> 1:18:02.011
* If you live it,
love it, breathe it *

1:18:02.078 --> 1:18:03.379
* And you really,
really mean it *

1:18:03.446 --> 1:18:05.081
* If you believe it

1:18:05.148 --> 1:18:07.784
* You just D-R-E-A-M *

1:18:07.851 --> 1:18:11.487

* D-R-E-A-M
5-6-7-8 *

1:18:20.930 --> 1:18:22.065
* Nothing's ever perfect *

1:18:22.131 --> 1:18:23.833
* But that's part
of all the fun *

1:18:23.900 --> 1:18:25.068
* If you practice really hard *

1:18:25.134 --> 1:18:26.302
* Then we can all be Number 1 *

1:18:26.369 --> 1:18:27.670
* Got to work hard *

1:18:27.737 --> 1:18:28.905
* Got to play hard *

1:18:28.972 --> 1:18:30.239

1:19:54.690 --> 1:19:58.061
* Waking up with glitter

1:19:58.127 --> 1:20:01.064
* Living in a neon paradise *

1:20:01.130 --> 1:20:04.300
