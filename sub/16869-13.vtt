00:54.760 --> 00:57.889

It's been two weeks since he disappeared.

I mean, no one's seen
or heard from him since.

01:29.040 --> 01:31.771
Slow down.
Just start from the beginning, okay?

01:31.920 --> 01:33.843
Why did your dad go to Gorilla City?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.001
<i>JOE: Wait. Can we slow down even further?</i>

01:35.160 --> 01:36.207
What the hell is a Gorilla City?

01:36.360 --> 01:37.407
Okay,

01:37.560 --> 01:39.881
(CLEARS THROAT) so there are sentient,

01:40.040 --> 01:42.202
highly intelligent evolved gorillas
in Earth-2.

01:42.360 --> 01:45.011
And they all live in a city
deep in the heart of Africa.

01:45.160 --> 01:47.208
We sent Grodd there
when he went after Fay Wray here.

01:47.360 --> 01:48.725
- Grodd's there?
-Mmm.

01:48.920 --> 01:51.207
Why on Earth, any Earth,
would your father wanna go there?

01:51.360 --> 01:53.886
I mean, we received a mathematical
cryptogram at our S.T.A.R. Labs.

01:54.040 --> 01:56.725
It was highly complex.
It took a week to decode it,

01:56.880 --> 01:58.120
but my dad and I did.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.281
What did it say?

01:59.440 --> 02:01.363
It was an invitation

02:02.040 --> 02:03.565
from the gorillas to my dad.

02:04.240 --> 02:06.766
- Why Harry?
-They wanted to meet him.

02:07.520 --> 02:10.285
So he mounted an expedition
with 10 other people,

02:10.479 --> 02:12.084
and they went into the jungle.

02:12.240 --> 02:15.562
But they failed multiple check-ins,
and a search party went in after them.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.209
(INHALES) But all they found
were the bodies,

02:19.120 --> 02:20.724
all of them beaten to death.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.528
But no one's seen my dad.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.481
(SNIFFLES) I mean, is he--

02:28.640 --> 02:30.449
No. No, he's alive.

02:30.600 --> 02:34.844
They went to a lot of trouble to get him
there. They need him for something.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.128
We're gonna figure out what that is.

02:37.440 --> 02:40.171
Oh... There you guys are!
I've been looking all over for you.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.765

02:49.800 --> 02:53.521
Jesse, that's not who you think it is.
This is H.R.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.921
You met him briefly
before you left last time.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.161
At your service, Madame.

02:57.360 --> 02:58.964
He's Harry's replacement.

02:59.120 --> 03:00.929
Some would say "improvement."

03:01.080 --> 03:03.003
- Um, this is Harry's daughter.
-Yeah.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.440
He's been kidnapped.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.046
Eep! I didn't know. I'm so-- I thought--

03:07.200 --> 03:08.440
Sorry about that.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.046
I'm sorry, too.
I'm sorry I took the smile from your face.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.206
This headline from the future,

03:23.360 --> 03:25.089
"City Still Recovering
From Gorilla Attack."

03:25.240 --> 03:28.961
So you're thinking this headline
and Harry being taken are tied together?

03:29.120 --> 03:31.487
I mean, it can't be a coincidence, right?

03:31.640 --> 03:34.803
Harry getting lured to Gorilla City.
Grodd must be planning something.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.883
Seems like he's planning
to come back to this Earth.

03:37.040 --> 03:38.644
And not alone, by the sound of it.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.963
If we rescue Harry, then maybe that stops
whatever Grodd's planning here,

03:42.120 --> 03:43.485
and maybe that changes the future.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.688
- Which would change my future.
-JOE: Mmm.

03:46.200 --> 03:49.443
So we save Harry, we save Iris.
But you're not sure.

03:49.600 --> 03:52.490
No, but I'm going either way.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.007
Harry's my friend.
I'm not gonna just abandon him.

03:55.160 --> 03:57.003
I'm going back to Earth-2.

03:57.160 --> 03:59.561
And I suppose you'll want
somebody to come with you

03:59.760 --> 04:01.330
who's gonna open those breaches for you?

04:01.480 --> 04:03.960
We had so much fun last time.

04:04.120 --> 04:06.691
<i>Fun-Eh. I'm 'm.</i>

04:07.720 --> 04:10.200
I'm gonna come, too.
I have a special connection with Grodd.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.885
Maybe we can use that
to get through to him.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.041
Yes, okay.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.247
Great, yeah, I'm coming, too.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.204
No, I'm sorry, Jesse. No.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.368
Look, I didn't come here
for you to take all the risk.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.521
I'm going to help.

04:19.680 --> 04:22.160
Your dad would kill me
if I let you come along.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.328
I'm a speedster now, okay?
I can take care of myself.

04:24.480 --> 04:26.767
I know, which is exactly why
I need you to stay here.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.526
I mean, this city needs protecting
while we're gone.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.444
Besides, maybe you can teach Wally
a thing or two.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.281
- Wait. What is he talking about?
-Um...

04:38.440 --> 04:39.680
- Wow.
-(CHUCKLES)

04:39.960 --> 04:41.803
So, you're a speedster now.

04:41.960 --> 04:43.086
Yeah, we're both speedsters now.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.882
Great. Yeah, that's, uh...

04:46.560 --> 04:48.483
(CLEARS THROAT) That's awesome.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.931
I, um, thought she'd be
more excited than that.

04:57.400 --> 05:00.324
Hey, Julian, would you maybe
be able to cover for me at work

05:00.480 --> 05:01.891
for the next few days?

05:02.040 --> 05:03.690
"Few days"? Why?

05:03.840 --> 05:06.320
I just have a thing where...

05:06.480 --> 05:08.881
-it's just... It's Flash stuff.
-Such as?

05:09.560 --> 05:10.561
(SIGHS)

05:11.400 --> 05:14.404
A friend of ours is lost
on a parallel Earth,

05:14.560 --> 05:16.369

05:16.520 --> 05:18.409
-"A parallel Earth"?
-Yeah, a--

05:18.560 --> 05:21.245
This is the... This is the multi-verse.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.081
(SCOFFS)

05:24.000 --> 05:26.924
Fascinating!
And do you often travel to other Earths?

05:27.080 --> 05:28.809
No, I... Well, when I have to.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.884
Look,JuHan,
will you just tell Singh that,

05:32.040 --> 05:33.724
I don't know,
I'm under the weather or something?

05:33.880 --> 05:36.770
You know, it is kind of what we do
on Team Flash. We cover for each other.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.685
What does Caitlin think of all this
multi-verse hopping? Does she approve?

05:39.840 --> 05:40.887
She's coming with me.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.769
- You're letting her go?
-it's her choice.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.729
Allen, it's not a wise move, surely.

05:45.880 --> 05:48.281
She can barely control her cold powers
as is, I mean...

05:48.440 --> 05:49.930
We might need her for Grodd.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.285
Grodd?

05:52.920 --> 05:54.922
- Telepathic gorilla?
-Yeah.

Where are you going?
Are you going to <i>Planet</i> of the <i>Apes?</i>

05:57.400 --> 05:59.767
No, it's just a city of them.
Okay, will you cover for me?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.371
<i>Are you</i> going <i>to Planet of the Apes?</i>

06:01.520 --> 06:04.285
I'm not going to <i>Planet</i> of the <i>Apes,</i> okay?
Calm down. Will you cover for me?

06:04.440 --> 06:05.601

08:40.039 --> 08:43.726
How exactly does saving someone
on this Earth prevent an attack on ours?

08:43.880 --> 08:47.009
If Grodd is planning to attack, he's gonna
need to open a breach to our Earth,

08:47.160 --> 08:49.083

that can open one is--

08:49.240 --> 08:50.241
CAITLIN: Harrison Wells.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.526
Harrison Wells, yeah.

08:51.680 --> 08:54.604
So, if we save him from Grodd,
then he can't get to our Earth,

08:54.800 --> 08:57.804
the attack never happens,
we change the future,

08:57.960 --> 09:00.440

09:12.640 --> 09:14.290
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

09:23.840 --> 09:24.966
Yeah, or other people.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.246
That is not what I meant.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.722
No, look, I get it. Trust me.

39:01.600 --> 39:02.931
I consider myself a genius.

39:03.080 --> 39:04.445
Okay, yeah, we're gonna go now.

39:04.600 --> 39:05.601
- Yeah.
-Yeah.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.569
Okay. Great.

39:07.720 --> 39:10.291
Congratulations, I'm happy for you.

39:10.440 --> 39:12.442
Invite me to the wedding.

39:14.760 --> 39:16.922
He's gonna be so pissed.

39:21.120 --> 39:23.122
Caitlin, wait.

39:26.240 --> 39:30.006
Listen, if I overstepped,
then I apologize.

39:31.240 --> 39:32.366
Just, after drinks the other night--

39:32.520 --> 39:34.921
You were willing to risk your life for me?

39:35.280 --> 39:38.489
(SIGHS) I've been doing
a lot of silly things recently.

39:38.640 --> 39:40.483
I thought adding one more to the list
wouldn't do any harm.

39:40.640 --> 39:42.642
I like you, Julian. I do.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.801
And I like that you like me,

39:45.960 --> 39:48.167
but I'm also afraid of my powers,

39:48.360 --> 39:49.885
and not what they could do to me,

39:50.040 --> 39:52.850
but what they could do to anyone
who gets close to me.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.287
- Caitlin, I'm not afraid.
-You should be.

39:56.120 --> 39:57.849
Fear me, Julian.

39:58.640 --> 40:02.042
It's not a threat, just good advice.

40:05.400 --> 40:08.847
Okay. Fine. I'll fear you.

40:10.840 --> 40:13.650
You know what really helps me
when I'm scared?

40:13.800 --> 40:14.801
What?

40:15.480 --> 40:17.323
Just a good fillet steak.

40:18.160 --> 40:21.323
Little Béarnaise on the side,
mashed potatoes.

40:21.520 --> 40:22.931
- Does the trick every time.
-Really?

40:23.080 --> 40:24.081
I promise.

40:24.240 --> 40:29.406
I think we should find a local steak house
and be terrified together.

40:30.880 --> 40:32.644
Sure, together it is.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.126
Well,

40:44.280 --> 40:45.281
We did it.

40:45.440 --> 40:46.566
You did it.

40:46.720 --> 40:50.042
No, we all did it.

40:50.200 --> 40:53.921
We changed the future
without changing who we are.

40:55.080 --> 40:58.368
If we can keep doing this,
we can stop Savitar.

40:58.960 --> 41:01.566
Wherever he is, however he's gonna
come at us, I can stop him.

41:01.720 --> 41:02.721
I know it now.

41:03.400 --> 41:04.481
How do you do that?

41:04.640 --> 41:05.846
Do what?

41:06.000 --> 41:08.207
Stay positive
in the face of overwhelming odds?

41:09.600 --> 41:10.601
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

41:12.080 --> 41:14.242
Because I plan on living
a long life with you,

41:15.400 --> 41:16.890
and nothing's gonna
take that away from me.

41:17.560 --> 41:18.561
Good.

41:21.120 --> 41:22.724
So does that mean no more nightmares?

41:22.880 --> 41:24.644
You're finally gonna get
some sleep tonight?

41:25.720 --> 41:29.042
Well, that last part
is entirely up to you.

41:29.560 --> 41:30.561
Oh?

41:41.560 --> 41:45.690
<i>GRODD: Like I told Flash,
always think ahead.</i>

41:46.640 --> 41:49.371
<i>Now you will open the breaches,</i>

41:49.520 --> 41:55.880
<i>and very soon,
Central City will fall before Grodd!</i>
