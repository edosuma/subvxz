NARRATOR:
Previously onX-Men...

00:03.875 --> 00:05.833
My psychic abilities
have discovered a creature
with more power

00:05.833 --> 00:08.458
than even
you can imagine!

00:08.458 --> 00:10.166
Do tell.

00:10.166 --> 00:12.625
FROST: They call her
the Phoenix.

00:12.625 --> 00:16.958
She was the guardian
of the fantastically
powerful M'Kraan Crystal.

00:16.958 --> 00:21.458
The Phoenix flew with
the crystal into
the burning heart of the sun!

00:21.458 --> 00:23.833
The Phoenix
destroyed herself?

00:23.833 --> 00:26.500
No! It lived!

00:26.500 --> 00:31.708
After depositing the crystal
in the sun, this primal force
returned to Earth.

00:33.083 --> 00:36.458
XAVIER: Phoenix, why do you
still inhabit Jean's body?
Your work is done.

00:36.458 --> 00:38.833
You do her harm
by remaining!

00:38.833 --> 00:41.333
The Phoenix
could be the source
of limitless power!

00:41.333 --> 00:47.250
Tradition demands that
such power be wielded by us,
the Inner Circle.

00:48.166 --> 00:51.875
She's asleep.
I'm in her mind.

00:51.875 --> 00:53.875
You may now enter.

00:53.875 --> 00:56.333
WYNGARDE: And once
I'm in her mind,

00:56.333 --> 01:00.375
I can use my power
of illusion to create
whatever reality I choose.

Not Jean.
I am Phoenix!

Good work,
my love.

01:14.583 --> 01:18.333
Thank you, my husband!

Do you read? Over.
Come in. Over.

02:35.458 --> 02:37.833
His communicator
must be down.

02:56.250 --> 02:59.958
Who would know
how to block
my psychic probe?

02:59.958 --> 03:02.458
Cerebro, help me
break through.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.458
Cerebro, why can we
not contact the X-Men?

03:24.875 --> 03:28.458
CEREBRO: Dual barriers,
one human, one electronic.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.708
Together they are confusing,
impenetrable.

03:31.708 --> 03:35.708
Keep probing.
I need a moment's rest.

03:38.708 --> 03:41.458
All right, Shaw.
You have them.

03:41.458 --> 03:43.458
Now what are
we going to
do with them?

03:43.458 --> 03:45.583
Whatever you like, Leland.

03:45.583 --> 03:49.333
You doubted my work.
Admit it,
you were wrong.

03:49.333 --> 03:51.000
I admit nothing!

03:51.000 --> 03:54.208
Why not just dispose of them
and be done with it?

03:54.208 --> 03:58.458
The mighty X-Men?
Are you mad?

03:58.458 --> 04:01.583
They'll make nice lab rats,
don't you think?

04:01.583 --> 04:05.000
Xavier has been trying
to contact
the X-Men psychically.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.958
I blocked the probe,
but I don't know
how long I can hold it off.

Get away from her!

04:25.500 --> 04:28.833
You cannot escape.
Nor can you hope
to be rescued.

The Circle Club is
an impregnable fortress.

05:23.375 --> 05:26.000
Question is,
"Can I get Wolverine

05:26.000 --> 05:29.083
before he turns me
into shish kebab
with those claws?"

05:29.083 --> 05:32.166
Well, bub, seeing as how
these claws are adamantium,

05:32.166 --> 05:34.083
the strongest metal known,

05:34.083 --> 05:36.125

vanadium steel

freshen up in here,

You say
she loves you, Wyngarde.

Would you two geniuses
think for a second?

We can't deceive

I need no help from a woman
to destroy the X-Men.

15:52.250 --> 15:57.375
I can absorb
all their powers.
Go ahead. Try it.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.250
(SHAW SCREAMS)

16:02.083 --> 16:05.125
Thanks, mon ami.
Leave the others
to Gambit.

16:05.125 --> 16:07.291
I'll hang on
to this one.

16:07.291 --> 16:08.291
(GAMBIT GRUNTS)

16:12.291 --> 16:14.291
She play rough!

16:14.291 --> 16:16.291
(GRUNTING)

16:19.291 --> 16:21.208
You're half bronco!

16:23.333 --> 16:24.708
Stop them!

16:26.333 --> 16:27.958
What in the world?

16:27.958 --> 16:28.958
(ROGUE GRUNTS)

16:30.750 --> 16:34.500
I'll get my queen.
I can still control her.

16:50.333 --> 16:55.250
Winds, rise and sweep
the thorns from our path!

16:57.333 --> 16:59.333
(MERCENARIES SCREAMING)

17:01.958 --> 17:04.833
People, mop up in here.
I have to find Jean.

17:07.166 --> 17:11.583
Forgive me, Mr. Shaw,
for dropping in uninvited.

17:11.583 --> 17:15.000
There's the fat pig
who dumped me in the sewer.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.458
Let's dance.

17:16.458 --> 17:18.500
Keep away! Uh-oh!

17:22.291 --> 17:24.000
SHAW: Stop it!

17:24.000 --> 17:26.958
You cannot absorb
what is not
focused upon you.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.375
Clever, but ineffective.

17:29.375 --> 17:33.166
My mutant power absorbs
the energy you use against me.

17:36.875 --> 17:40.208
The Inner Circle is
not so easily defeated!

17:40.208 --> 17:44.291
Ice, snow,
vent your fury!

17:44.291 --> 17:47.500
(STUTTERING)
You can't do this to me!

17:50.500 --> 17:52.208
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

17:52.208 --> 17:53.875
FROST: Get out of my way!

18:00.416 --> 18:03.416
Jean?
Jean, where are you?

18:05.750 --> 18:09.708
Lowlifes, pretenders!
I'll show you!

18:10.458 --> 18:11.458
(STORM GRUNTS)

18:15.000 --> 18:18.333
No one can defeat
Sebastian Shaw.

18:22.416 --> 18:26.000
You couldn't manage
a heat wave,
by any chance?

18:37.583 --> 18:39.625
Thanks for
the hand, sugar!

18:39.625 --> 18:43.416
I bet these cybernetic things
cost an arm and a leg.

18:49.458 --> 18:51.166
This way!

18:51.166 --> 18:53.500
We've lost because of
Wyngarde's incompetence!

18:53.500 --> 18:59.250
But the Inner Circle lives.
We will get our revenge.

19:05.458 --> 19:09.500
GAMBIT: Look like
the hotshot Inner Circle
high-tailed it out of here.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.833
But where's Jean
and Cyclops?

19:16.750 --> 19:20.208
My dearest, you have
succumbed to your nightmare
again, my darling.

19:20.208 --> 19:22.208
But fear not.

19:22.208 --> 19:24.583
I have come to rescue you,
to take you back
to your real life.

19:24.583 --> 19:27.250
To our life together.

19:28.583 --> 19:33.583
Your pathetic attempt
to use me
has opened my eyes!

19:34.458 --> 19:38.291
No! Please!
I cared for you! I...

19:40.458 --> 19:44.208
You had me do evil
to gain you power.

19:44.208 --> 19:47.750
But through this body,
I felt the thrill
of that evil.

19:47.750 --> 19:51.125
Now I thirst for more!

19:52.208 --> 19:53.583
(CHOKING)

19:54.291 --> 19:57.583
I am too powerful
for your illusions.

19:58.458 --> 20:03.208
Let the world see
how truly ugly you are.

20:04.208 --> 20:09.000
Would you like to
see me as I truly am,

20:09.583 --> 20:11.708
my love?

20:20.500 --> 20:22.500
Jean? Jean?

20:23.958 --> 20:28.000
The mortal Jean Grey
is no more.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.583
I am fire made flesh!

20:31.583 --> 20:34.125
Power incarnate!

20:34.125 --> 20:38.875
I am the Dark Phoenix!

20:38.875 --> 20:41.500
Jean? No!

20:46.000 --> 20:47.875
