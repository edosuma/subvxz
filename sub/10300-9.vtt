01:17.080 --> 01:18.672
Where's Dad? It's almost time.

01:18.880 --> 01:21.792
Well, the shoe store closed
about five minutes ago.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.718
He's gotta count the day's receipts...

01:23.920 --> 01:26.150
...so he should be walking in
any second now.

01:26.360 --> 01:28.555
The day has finally come.

01:28.760 --> 01:31.593
Perhaps the proudest day
in the history of the Bundy household.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.711
I want the whole family
to share in this.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.394
Buck, you ready, boy?

01:38.920 --> 01:40.751
Calm down, Buck.

01:41.880 --> 01:43.472
- Where's Mom?
- She's out shopping.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.989
Good. Then the whole family is here.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.433
Man, what a day.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.437
After all the praying, the dreaming...

01:50.640 --> 01:53.473
...the saving of every penny,
the Bundys have finally arrived.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.159
Today...

01:55.360 --> 01:56.952
...we get cable TV.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.991
Yes. Yes.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.112
- Can I get a "whoa cable"?
- Oh, yeah.

02:03.320 --> 02:05.914
Whoa, cable!

02:08.080 --> 02:10.958
All right. Now, kids,
the cable should come on any minute.

02:11.160 --> 02:14.232
But to make every day our birthdays,
I have a very special gift.

02:14.440 --> 02:18.433
May I present the Cadillac
of television controls:

02:18.640 --> 02:22.076
The Channelmaster 2000.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.672
Hey, don't touch it, you swine.
It's mine.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.358
Man, this baby can do anything.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.755
Changes channels backwards,
changes them forward.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.996
It's like having a wife
crouching by the TV...

02:33.200 --> 02:35.191
...except I wouldn't mind
sleeping with this.

02:37.960 --> 02:40.793
And it's got a half-a-mile radius.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.676
Why, I could control Marcie's TV
sitting right here by my command post.

02:45.880 --> 02:47.757
Matter of fact...

02:49.120 --> 02:51.714
- Oh, Dad, you shouldn't do that.
- Oh, Dad.

02:53.640 --> 02:57.918
All right, enough frivolity.
Kids, man the cable book.

02:58.120 --> 03:01.590
I am turning on the TV.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.272
What's this?

03:04.480 --> 03:07.040
It's the Japanese Channel, Dad.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.751
- What's this?
- It's the Polka Channel.

03:13.040 --> 03:16.794
- What's this?
- That's the Stained Glass Network.

03:17.840 --> 03:19.910
There doesn't seem to be much
on cable either.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.394
Kids, fear not.

03:21.600 --> 03:25.718
We still have
78 more channels to go.

03:28.320 --> 03:29.548
Well, what's wrong, Dad?

03:29.760 --> 03:33.548
I just never thought I could be
so happy sitting next to you two.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.550
All right, guys, get ready.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.513
In front of us lies
all the entertainment...

03:41.720 --> 03:44.996
...that the great minds
of show business can provide.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.152
Well, Dad...

03:57.960 --> 04:01.555
...you've been sitting there
for 36 hours straight now.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.559
I will not give up.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.069
I am paying $60 a month
to be entertained...

04:06.280 --> 04:10.319
...and I will be entertained
if I never enjoy another day in my life.

04:11.480 --> 04:13.118
Oh, now, this is better.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.755
Yeah, here's the
Sally Struthers Whining Channel.

04:17.440 --> 04:20.079
Oh, look at the starving children.

04:20.279 --> 04:23.113
Boy, man, now we're having fun.

04:23.840 --> 04:27.310
And stay tuned for Cagney & Lacey.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.948
Oh, Daddy, I have been so wronged.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.434
You have been so wronged?

04:33.640 --> 04:36.393
Look what I'm spending
60 bucks a month for.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.353
Well, at least l... At least I got this.

04:44.840 --> 04:46.956
Now I feel lucky.

04:47.160 --> 04:51.756
Today on the Medical Channel,
Doctor Bob removes an ovary.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.475
Well, you may as well bore me
with your problems.

04:56.680 --> 04:57.908
Okay.

04:58.120 --> 05:01.635
Well, my whole modelling class went
down to be on public-access television.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.434
You know,
for our poise-and-personality tests.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.995
So, what'd you do?
Spin diaphragms on your fingers...

05:07.200 --> 05:09.475
...while singing
"Somewhere in the Night"?

05:13.120 --> 05:14.519
Anyway...

05:14.720 --> 05:16.517
...every girl was supposed
to be on TV.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.712
But did I get a turn?
Ask me if I got a turn.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.036
Ask me. Just go ahead and ask me.

05:25.960 --> 05:28.599
No, I did not.
And you know why?

05:28.800 --> 05:31.473
Because my teacher, Mrs. Jones,
doesn't like me.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.753
Because one day she wore
a pair of jeans that said "Guess"...

05:34.960 --> 05:37.428
...and I guessed size 42.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.950
Instead of giving me a prize,
she cops an attitude.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.878
Anyway...

05:48.840 --> 05:50.512
So every girl got to be on TV...

05:50.720 --> 05:52.870
...but then they ran out of time
before my turn.

05:53.080 --> 05:56.277
Now I don't even have a tape
for when it comes time for my grade.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.879
Now, come on, Kel.

05:58.080 --> 06:01.516
There's gotta be plenty of
videotapes of you lying around.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.628
Now, what's wrong with...

06:05.840 --> 06:09.594
...the " I can make my dress go this
high" classic from the third grade?

06:10.280 --> 06:11.599
Gee, Bud, it's Friday night.

06:11.800 --> 06:15.588
Shouldn't you be taking a shower,
getting dressed up and going to bed?

06:21.280 --> 06:23.077
Oh, Daddy, my life is over.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.236
I wish I was dead.
What should I do?

06:25.440 --> 06:28.432
Well, honey,
I'm glad you've come to me.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.315
- Because I have plenty...
- Look, Dad. Look. Hooters!

06:31.520 --> 06:34.273
- Where? Where?
- Right there.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.555
That's an elbow, son.

06:42.160 --> 06:44.879
Well, look whose word
you were taking.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.678
Hi, Al.

06:51.200 --> 06:54.158
You know, the weirdest thing's
been happening over at my house.

06:54.360 --> 06:57.796
The channels on the TV
began changing all by themselves.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.479
Would you do me a favour?

07:01.680 --> 07:05.116
Could you turn on the Public Access
Channel? Marcie's gonna be on.

07:05.320 --> 07:08.630
Oh, great, even the old and boring
get on before me.

07:14.280 --> 07:17.875
Welcome back to
Short-Haired Women in Banking.

07:18.080 --> 07:22.232
And now for the question our financial
experts have been dying to ask. ;

07:22.440 --> 07:27.116
How does a short-haired woman
juggle a career, carry a baby...

07:27.320 --> 07:30.915
...and still manage
to sexually satisfy her man?

07:32.720 --> 07:34.836
Well, it's not easy.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.793
Actually my husband has
been feeling a little left out...

07:38.000 --> 07:39.513
...because the baby's coming.

07:39.720 --> 07:43.349
So we've been playing out
my role as Mommy in bed.

07:43.560 --> 07:47.553
Sometimes he's a bad boy
and needs a good spanking.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.076
Well, I guess I was wrong.
Marcie's not gonna be on.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.553
As a matter of fact,
he used to have a little problem...

08:01.760 --> 08:04.752
...with, shall we say, hang time.

08:06.280 --> 08:09.272
But I told him not to worry,
it's not him.

08:09.920 --> 08:13.754
"I just have some banking problems
on my mind."

08:18.920 --> 08:20.797
Hey, how'd she get on TV anyway?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.433
It's public access.

08:22.640 --> 08:26.235
Anyone with $35 and a pack of lies
to tell about her husband can get on.

08:26.440 --> 08:30.194
- Here we go.
- Can I have $35 to be on TV, please?

08:30.400 --> 08:32.515
Honey, we're not millionaires.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.875
Now, honey,
I know you're disappointed.

08:36.080 --> 08:39.231
But if this counts for anything,
you'll always be my little girl...

08:39.440 --> 08:41.669
...and I'll always have time for you.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.279
Oh, Daddy.

08:43.480 --> 08:46.313
Now that's a hooter.
You see what I mean?

08:46.560 --> 08:48.994
Oh, my gosh.

08:58.920 --> 09:03.710
And stay tuned for
The All White Guys Slam Dunk Contest.

09:05.400 --> 09:08.233
Dad, you haven't left the house
in three days now.

09:08.440 --> 09:10.590
Not that it would matter
if you lost your job...

09:10.800 --> 09:14.713
...but it's embarrassing having your
old Dodge parked out front all day.

09:15.840 --> 09:18.274
I mean, what if people
start thinking it's mine?

09:19.120 --> 09:22.112
I am not getting off the couch
until I find something to watch.

09:24.240 --> 09:27.710
Well, there you go,
Roger Ebert's Dance Party.

09:28.640 --> 09:31.518
It's almost time for Kelly's debut
on the Public Access Channel.

09:31.720 --> 09:35.429
Oh, good. That won't bring
any more shame to the family.

09:36.520 --> 09:37.873
What do you think she'll do?

09:38.080 --> 09:41.197
A scholarly discussion
of Ezra Pound's poetry?

09:41.400 --> 09:43.197
Or getting her hair stuck
in her mouth...

09:43.400 --> 09:45.868
...and chasing it around
the way a dog chases its tail?

09:46.080 --> 09:47.752
Like a dog.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.234
Am I on yet? Am I on yet?

09:52.440 --> 09:55.876
- Is that me?
- It's a cartoon, honey.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.591
Oh, it's coming on. It's coming on.

09:59.800 --> 10:04.316
Everyone expected a piece of fluff, but
we wanted to do something important...

10:04.520 --> 10:06.875
...something the youth of America
could relate to.

10:07.080 --> 10:09.753
You know, issue stuff.

10:17.440 --> 10:21.672
Today's topic: Cute butts
and the men they're attached to.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.354
Hi, welcome to my show. I'm Kelly.

10:30.320 --> 10:33.551
Now, as you all know,
it costs $35 to put on a show...

10:33.760 --> 10:38.072
...so I asked my Dad for the money,
but he's a shoe salesman.

10:39.120 --> 10:43.272
So I had to turn to my unemployed
teenage friends for the money.

10:43.520 --> 10:45.238
I just plugged you, Daddy.

10:45.440 --> 10:48.079
Yes, you did, pumpkin.

10:48.760 --> 10:51.149
And now I would like
to introduce my guests.

10:51.360 --> 10:55.114
Cyndy, she gave $10. As did Roberta.

10:55.320 --> 10:59.996
And Samantha, who's rich because her
dad knocks off convenience stores...

11:00.840 --> 11:02.353
...gave $14.50.

11:02.800 --> 11:06.236
And my very special guest,
who gave an eye-popping 50 cents...

11:06.440 --> 11:08.829
...Mr. Vinnie Verducci.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.276
So, what would you like
to talk about, Vinnie?

11:19.720 --> 11:23.235
Well, I'd like to take
the pro or con side...

11:23.440 --> 11:25.112
...whichever is against...

11:25.320 --> 11:28.915
...the enforcement of
motorcycle helmet laws.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.793
I mean, say I pull up to some chick.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.915
Now, I'm doing a conservative 75
in a 30-mile-an-hour zone...

11:37.120 --> 11:41.557
...so of course I only have seconds
to seduce her with my eyes.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.911
You see this look?

11:46.920 --> 11:51.038
How are they supposed to see it
with Tupperware strapped to my head?

11:51.440 --> 11:55.035
I'd look like that dork the Rocketeer
for God's sakes...

11:55.240 --> 11:59.153
...which, by the way,
was death at the box office.

11:59.360 --> 12:03.069
Now, I've fallen on my head
100 times...

12:03.280 --> 12:07.558
...and you don't hear me crying,
"I can't think. I can't think."

12:11.520 --> 12:13.715
What were we talking about?

12:15.160 --> 12:16.388
Men's butts.

12:17.280 --> 12:20.829
I'd like to see them try
and get a helmet on my butt.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.312
Thank you, Vinnie.
Your 50 cents is up. Get out.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.475
And now I would like
to introduce our band:

12:36.680 --> 12:38.989
Joanie and the Slashettes!

12:42.280 --> 12:45.078
One, two, three, four.

12:46.280 --> 12:48.157
Soda!

12:53.080 --> 12:56.993
Do you believe that they wrote that
in the elevator coming up here.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.953
The mind wobbles, doesn't it?

13:02.520 --> 13:06.433
Okay. Now, as I recall, we were right
in the middle of men's butts.

13:06.680 --> 13:08.477
Cyndy...

13:09.440 --> 13:11.192
...who do you think
has the cutest butt?

13:11.400 --> 13:13.356
I do.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.996
No, we're talking about men's butts.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.758
Mel Gibson.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.474
Lethal Weapon...

13:22.280 --> 13:24.714
Okay. Okay, girls. Let's get serious.

13:24.920 --> 13:26.956
Two, three, four.

13:28.360 --> 13:29.793
Serious!

13:30.600 --> 13:32.875
Which brings us to a tragic story.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.833
A girl... We'll call her Jeannie.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.235
- Got a bad perm.

13:43.880 --> 13:46.235
I know that this must be
very hard for you, Jeannie.

13:46.440 --> 13:49.716
Thank you for being here today.
Now...

13:50.320 --> 13:54.632
...what went through your mind
when you first saw your perm?

13:54.840 --> 13:56.034
I screamed.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.709
I cried. I ran the gamut.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.673
You poor thing.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.394
Remember, folks,
it's up to you to help.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.990
You can make a difference.
Phone your pledges in now.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.714
Call 555-PERM.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.631
Ladies and gentlemen...

14:15.840 --> 14:18.559
...this could happen to you!

14:20.360 --> 14:23.670
And now another number
from our band.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.636
Two, three, four.

14:29.240 --> 14:30.719
Spit!

14:35.200 --> 14:37.634
Makes you think, doesn't it?

14:38.200 --> 14:41.397
Okay, now it's time
for my favourite part of the show.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.797
We're gonna talk about girls
that we don't like.

14:46.040 --> 14:50.477
The Vital Social Issues 'N Stuff
with Kelly slut of the week is:

14:50.680 --> 14:53.069
Two, three, four.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.157
Slut!

14:57.040 --> 14:58.268
Thank you.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.755
Is Vicki.

15:12.360 --> 15:17.115
Now, not only is Vicki too cheap
to give $1.50 to be on the show...

15:17.320 --> 15:19.993
...but she also borrows clothes
and doesn't give them back.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.952
And if she does...

15:22.160 --> 15:24.594
...she doesn't give them back
with the hanger.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.995
- She's trash.
- She's dirt.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.599
She gave me this perm.

15:34.280 --> 15:35.998
So for all these things...

15:36.200 --> 15:40.876
...we all give you, Vicki,
a big get-a-yeast-infection salute.

15:47.840 --> 15:51.230
And now on to career talk.

15:52.840 --> 15:55.274
- What?
- Ask me the question.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.675
Oh, right. Say, Kelly...

15:57.880 --> 16:00.792
...we understand that you go
to modelling school.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.958
Well, I'm glad that you
brought that up, Roberta.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.634
My classmates
are a bunch of skanks.

16:09.240 --> 16:10.719
And my teacher stinks.

16:10.920 --> 16:14.071
They wouldn't let me be on TV.
It's because they're jealous.

16:14.280 --> 16:16.589
But I'm on now, aren't I?

16:17.880 --> 16:21.714
Well, I can see by the clock
on the wall that it's...

16:22.040 --> 16:24.349
Five, 10, 15, 20...

16:28.960 --> 16:30.632
But before we go...

16:30.840 --> 16:34.196
...I would like to do a number
with the band that I wrote myself.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.277
Ladies.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.474
Two, three, four.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.232
I'm on TV and you are not
Drop dead, Mrs. Jones

16:53.040 --> 16:54.234
Die!

16:54.440 --> 16:57.079
Size 42

17:01.440 --> 17:03.431
Two, three, four.

17:13.319 --> 17:14.992
So, what'd you think?

17:19.680 --> 17:21.989
I mean, it was great, right?

17:26.160 --> 17:28.037
Well, honey...

17:28.240 --> 17:30.879
...we're gonna have
a little meeting over here.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.273
Kelly, you go over there.

17:38.920 --> 17:40.148
Now, she tried really hard.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.918
- We can't hurt her feelings.
- Yeah.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.350
We gotta think of something nice
to say to her.

17:44.560 --> 17:45.879
How about, "At least they didn't...

17:46.080 --> 17:48.674
...send the Energizer Bunny
through the show"?

17:51.960 --> 17:54.235
Let's be nice to her this one time.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.793
Now... I know.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.675
Let's go over and say
that we didn't see it.

18:05.280 --> 18:08.431
Honey, we have something to tell you.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.875
Well, I have something to tell you too.

18:11.080 --> 18:13.594
They love me.
I'm gonna be on every week.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.950
So, what were you gonna say?

18:19.200 --> 18:22.636
Dad's dramatic reading in a pathetic
attempt to get on Kelly's show.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.637
Take six.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.476
Thank you, Daddy. Thank you.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.875
Honey, now to help you choose...

19:15.080 --> 19:17.640
...do you think I should do
"The Girl from Ipanema" again?

19:17.840 --> 19:19.717
No. Please, no, Daddy.

19:20.040 --> 19:24.955
Now, listen, I appreciate
whatever it was that you were doing...

19:25.160 --> 19:28.550
...but the station wants a show with me
and the girls. And I'm really having fun.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.478
Why can't you
just be proud of me?

19:30.680 --> 19:34.719
Well, I am proud of you, pumpkin.

19:35.520 --> 19:39.798
I hope the show does even better
so that I can be more proud of you.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.955
Little untalented and ungrateful
flash in the pan.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.151
Out of the way!

19:47.200 --> 19:48.428
Oh, boy, that was painful.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.835
I'm glad I don't have
to go through that again.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.152
Kel...

20:33.720 --> 20:37.030
...you gotta picture the whole
thing in a pair of Speedos.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.074
That's what we think.

20:43.280 --> 20:46.909
Tell us what you think on the subject. ;
Briefs or boxers?

20:47.120 --> 20:49.953
Don't let it be his decision.

20:52.720 --> 20:55.553
Dad, it's been three weeks
and Kelly's show is still on.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.239
I think it's taken off.

20:57.440 --> 21:01.433
Can it be that we were wrong?
Can this be a success?

21:01.640 --> 21:04.154
Well, son, I don't know anything
about TV...

21:04.360 --> 21:06.430
...don't know anything
about the world...

21:06.640 --> 21:09.837
...don't know anything
about Siegfried & Roy's home life.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.675
But I do know that Kelly is a Bundy.

21:13.880 --> 21:17.714
And there's no way in the world
a Bundy will succeed at anything.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.912
Does that make you feel better, son?

21:21.640 --> 21:23.915
Oh yeah, Dad. I'm high as a kite now.

21:25.600 --> 21:30.116
Good. Because any time now, she's
gonna come through that door crying:

21:30.320 --> 21:34.791
"Daddy, Daddy, it's all over.
People realize my show stinks.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.150
I should have had you on.

21:37.840 --> 21:42.595
Only you, the mighty duke of Earl,
could have saved my show.

21:43.080 --> 21:45.674
But now it's too late and I failed."

21:48.760 --> 21:51.069
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

21:51.280 --> 21:52.633
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

21:52.840 --> 21:56.116
Well, pumpkin,
what could have happened?

21:56.760 --> 21:59.069
They contacted me
down at the station.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.432
And?

22:01.840 --> 22:04.070
A real network wants
to put my show on prime time.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.077
- I'm going to Hollywood!
- What?

22:06.280 --> 22:08.350
- Yes! Yes!
- Hollywood?

22:11.280 --> 22:12.679
Get on out of here!
