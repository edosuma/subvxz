01:20.120 --> 01:25.035
Sir, we've located the black
box. You should get something now.

01:25.240 --> 01:30.712
Confirmed. Ident details
- SSS Esperanto. Ocean seeding ship.

01:30.880 --> 01:34.555
Mission to introduce oceanic
life to potential S-3 planets.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.235
This was a recon trip. A
three-year check, strictly routine,

01:38.400 --> 01:41.358
to make sure the amino acids had taken.

01:41.560 --> 01:46.031
They'd been trying some new
technique to accelerate evolution.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.873
Topped even their best projections.

01:49.080 --> 01:53.232
They got five million years of
evolution in three solar years.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.749
So what happened?

01:56.560 --> 02:01.793
Final entry, routine stuff. They spent the
day cataloguing and indexing new life forms.

02:01.960 --> 02:04.554
- Then it stops.
- The question which occurs:

02:04.720 --> 02:08.758
all these new life
forms, where are they all?

02:08.960 --> 02:11.599
- What are you implying?
- No implication, sir.

02:11.800 --> 02:15.315
Yes, there is. You're saying
there's some huge damn fish?

02:15.480 --> 02:21.555
Some kind of gigantic pre-historic leviathan
who's porked its way through the ocean.

02:21.760 --> 02:24.479
- That's one option.
- Any alternatives?

02:24.680 --> 02:27.797
- None that occur.
- Hey, wait a minute. I've got it.

02:27.960 --> 02:31.999
- Don't fish swim south for the winter?
- No, that's birds, sir.

02:32.200 --> 02:36.273
Birds swim south for the
winter? How do they breathe?

02:38.240 --> 02:39.673
Guys.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.195
Rimmer, you getting this?

02:42.400 --> 02:44.755
It looks like Norman Bates's mum.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.429
Human, male, Caucasian.

02:49.600 --> 02:55.118
Cause of death - gunshot wound to the head.
From the wounds, most likely self-inflicted.

02:55.280 --> 02:57.077
Here's another one!

02:58.680 --> 03:02.355
- Two suicides?
- There's more!

03:04.400 --> 03:07.551
Oh, male. Oriental. Clearly,
he committed seppuku.

03:07.720 --> 03:10.359
Hey! Look what I found.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.994
Species
- unknown. Similar to Earth haddock.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.038
Cause of death
- suffocation. What?

03:16.200 --> 03:19.397
- What is it?
- This fish suffocated in water.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.710
It voluntarily closed its own gills.

03:21.920 --> 03:24.309
Are you saying this
haddock committed suicide?

03:25.120 --> 03:27.156
I'm merely stating the known facts.

03:27.320 --> 03:32.599
This fish relinquished its life
of its own free will. Damn fool!

03:33.640 --> 03:36.393
Why would a haddock kill itself?

03:36.560 --> 03:39.358
Why am I even asking that question?

03:39.560 --> 03:41.915
Hang five, guys. I'm getting something.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.674
He committed suicide,
he committed suicide,

03:44.840 --> 03:47.991
he committed suicide and
the fish committed suicide.

03:48.160 --> 03:51.277
There's some kind of link here.

03:51.480 --> 03:54.870
Hang on a minute, guys. Check this.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.715
It's an unknown compound.

04:00.880 --> 04:05.112
Best guess is some sort of hallucinogenic
venom secreted by a piscine source,

04:05.280 --> 04:08.238
not unlike the Earth
octopus or giant squid.

04:08.400 --> 04:12.279
- This is octopus ink?
- I'm just completing a chemical analysis.

04:12.440 --> 04:13.839
- Oh. Er...
- What?

04:14.040 --> 04:16.190
- Come on!
- What's happening?

04:16.920 --> 04:19.798
- We have to go!
- Kryten, what's going on?

04:20.000 --> 04:23.231
- Entering air lock.
- Repressurising now.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.277
Some kind of sea creature, a life form

04:25.278 --> 04:27.598
never encountered before,
attacked this ship.

04:27.800 --> 04:31.998
Its defence mechanism is curious.
It secretes a venom, a poison,

04:32.160 --> 04:36.472
possibly even a hallucinogenic, which
disfunctions its prey by inducing despair.

04:36.680 --> 04:39.990
That's why the crew members
and that fish committed suicide.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.760
Unfortunately, we
have been contaminated.

04:42.920 --> 04:47.789
It's a greatly reduced dose
but we may experience moments...

04:47.960 --> 04:50.269
. of despair and anguish.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.431
What about Lister and the Cat?

04:52.600 --> 04:55.717
I'm OK. I don't seem to be affected.

04:55.880 --> 04:59.839
I don't think anyone's
loved me in my entire life,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.070
but there's nothing new about that.

05:02.240 --> 05:06.358
What's gotten into you? It's like
Saturday night at the Wailing Wall.

05:06.520 --> 05:09.273
Why is it always me
that has to be strong?

05:09.440 --> 05:12.273
You guys just fall apart.

05:12.440 --> 05:17.275
We should get back and take a mood
stabiliser. I suggest lithium carbonate.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.676
I know this isn't what
you want to hear right now

05:22.840 --> 05:29.313
but there's a blob on the scope the size
of New Mexico and it's heading your way.

05:29.520 --> 05:33.195
I think the Suicide Squid is
about to make an appearance.

05:33.400 --> 05:37.552
- Where is it precisely?
- Right above you, 2,000 fathoms and diving.

05:37.760 --> 05:42.117
Oh, thanks, Rimmer. You
know the state we're in!

05:42.320 --> 05:47.030
- You couldn't have lied?
- I was lying. It's only 1,000 fathoms.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.635
We're entering Starbug's airlock now.

05:56.360 --> 05:58.351
What's it doing?

05:58.520 --> 06:02.115
It's trying to work out
what we are. Cut the power.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.830
This venom, are we safe in here?

06:05.040 --> 06:08.635
It penetrated the hull
of a class D seeding ship.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.870
In comparison, we're a sardine tin.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.559
- It's moving.
- Where?

06:12.760 --> 06:14.478
- Down.
- Speed?

06:14.680 --> 06:16.989
- 15 knots... 16... 18...
- It's diving.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.792
- Course?
- Collision.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.231
- Do we move or stay?
- 25 knots... 35... 50...

06:22.440 --> 06:26.877
- It's coming straight for us.
- It thinks we're a threat, food or a mate.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.799
It's gonna kill us, eat us or hump us.

06:29.960 --> 06:34.351
We either persuade him that we're not
that kind of vessel or scarper pronto.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.996
Diddled by a giant
squid on a first date?

06:38.600 --> 06:43.549
OK, we're going to try and
outrun it. Holly, give me manual.

06:50.840 --> 06:54.310
Change bearing, one zero five.
There's some natural caverns.

06:54.480 --> 06:59.076
- It might give us some cover.
- That's a yo, Holly. New course set.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.999
- It's hit us!
- Look out!

07:25.480 --> 07:31.271
You have been engaged in the Total
Immersion Video Game Red Dwarf.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.751
As with all role-playing adventures,

07:33.920 --> 07:38.198
you will experience a certain amount
of disorientation on leaving the game.

07:38.360 --> 07:42.797
It will be several minutes before
your real-life memories return.

07:42.960 --> 07:47.317
In the meantime, please disengage
the game-playing machinery and relax

07:47.480 --> 07:51.075
until an attendant is free
to answer your questions.

07:51.240 --> 07:57.713
On behalf of Leisure World International,
may we say welcome back to reality.

08:04.320 --> 08:08.108
This is a very, very bad dream, right?

08:13.040 --> 08:15.952
- I'm not a hologram.
- I'm half human.

08:16.160 --> 08:19.311
What the hell's happened to my teeth?!

08:24.080 --> 08:26.913
I can open beer bottles
with my overbite.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.195
All right. How you feeling?

08:30.360 --> 08:35.354
Bit wonky? Perfectly normal. You'll
be as right as rain in 20 minutes.

08:35.520 --> 08:40.434
If you'd move into the recuperation lounge,
I'll get things ready for the next lot.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.154
- Next lot?
- Yeah, very popular, Red Dwarf.

08:43.360 --> 08:46.557
It's got a two-year
waiting list on 20 machines.

08:46.760 --> 08:50.389
- So, how'd you get killed, then?
- Some kind of squid.

08:50.560 --> 08:53.154
The Despair Squid? That
shouldn't have killed you.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.629
Why didn't you use the laser cannons?

08:55.840 --> 08:59.549
Starbug doesn't - didn't -
have laser cannon capability.

08:59.760 --> 09:04.151
You twonk! You use the laser cannons
on the crashed wotsit... Esperanto.

09:04.320 --> 09:09.189
- That's how you get out of it.
- How could we know, you Brummie git?

09:09.360 --> 09:11.430
Esperanto. That's a clue, isn't it?

09:11.600 --> 09:15.832
Esperanto, hope. Hope defeats
despair, the Despair Squid.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.514
It's a blatant clue, isn't it? Blatant.

09:18.680 --> 09:21.752
You must have been
playing like puddings!

09:21.920 --> 09:24.275
Which one was playing Lister, then?

09:24.440 --> 09:27.034
- Me.
- Did you get Kochanski?

09:27.920 --> 09:30.036
Was I supposed to?

09:30.200 --> 09:34.318
Supposed to? That's the objective
of the game for Lister, you twonk.

09:34.480 --> 09:40.112
You get separated to begin with. It's a love
story across time, space, death and reality.

09:40.280 --> 09:45.229
You must have got the easy stuff. What
about the planet of the nymphomaniacs?

09:45.440 --> 09:49.797
- The planet of the what?!
- You missed that? Oh! That's a riot.

09:49.960 --> 09:52.269
Some people spend years on that.

09:54.040 --> 09:57.239
Are you seriously telling
me you were playing

09:57.240 --> 10:00.229
the prat version of
Rimmer for four years?

10:00.400 --> 10:03.710
Oh-ho! That's a classic,
that is. That's a classic.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.989
All right, lads. Which one's Lister?

10:07.720 --> 10:12.350
Right. Got your food bag, bio-feedback,
catheter... It's all there.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.715
You can start plugging yourself in.

10:14.880 --> 10:18.111
Here, don't confuse the
food pipe with the catheter.

10:18.280 --> 10:23.513
Some bloke did, we didn't spot it for
two days. OK, Kryten. In you go, son.

10:23.720 --> 10:27.429
OK, Cat, Rimmer... Give
us some room here, chaps?

10:27.640 --> 10:31.110
Well, where do we go? Our
memories haven't returned yet.

10:31.320 --> 10:35.279
The re-cup-er-a-tion
lounge. I keep telling you!

10:35.480 --> 10:38.995
Blimey! No wonder you
only scored four per cent.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.509
Cor! What a bunch of twonks.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.789
I'm not Lister, then. I'm not me, am I?

10:50.000 --> 10:53.072
None of us are who we
thought we were, sir.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.396
- I'm not Rimmer, then?
- No.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.789
I'm not a hologram. I'm not Rimmer.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.231
Well, who the hell are we?

11:02.440 --> 11:06.956
The kind of sad acts who spend
four years playing a computer game.

11:07.120 --> 11:11.830
Either we're running from God knows
what or have nothing worth living for.

11:12.040 --> 11:15.237
- Is there a Duane Dibbley here?
- Pardon?

11:15.440 --> 11:17.476
- Duane Dibbley?
- No, sorry.

11:17.680 --> 11:22.276
How do you know there's no one called
Duane Dibbley here? It could be you.

11:22.480 --> 11:27.838
No, this is right. This is the Dibbley
party. Which one's Duane Dibbley?

11:34.200 --> 11:39.035
No. No, no, please, no! I
don't want to be Duane Dibbley.

11:39.240 --> 11:44.155
It's you. Here are your party's possessions.
The medical officer will be down soon.

11:44.360 --> 11:46.920
Duane Dibbley? How
can I be Duane Dibbley?

11:47.080 --> 11:51.198
It's true. It's got your photograph,
name, address on it and everything.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.071
There's an anorak in here!

11:56.480 --> 11:59.472
White socks... nylon shirt...

11:59.640 --> 12:04.350
plastic sandals... Aertex vest...

12:04.560 --> 12:09.588
cardigan... oh, and a key
to the Salvation Army hostel.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.391
It doesn't make sense.

12:13.560 --> 12:17.235
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
it makes perfect sense...

12:17.400 --> 12:18.753
Duane!

12:19.920 --> 12:23.390
Imagine a guy with no elan, no style
- a misfit.

12:23.560 --> 12:30.113
Wouldn't this hapless creature give his buck
teeth to play the Cat in a computer game?

12:30.680 --> 12:33.114
So this is really me?

12:33.280 --> 12:38.593
A no-style gimbo with teeth the druids
could use as a place of worship?!

12:39.160 --> 12:42.232
- All right, this one's you.
- Oh. Who am I?

12:43.280 --> 12:46.431
Wow! You're a detective

12:46.600 --> 12:49.592
in the cybernautic division
of the police department.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.519
Oh... ha... Golly. Really?

12:52.720 --> 12:56.349
- Yeah. This is your badge.
- A detective? What's my name?

12:56.560 --> 12:59.074
Jake. Jake Bullet.

13:02.040 --> 13:06.909
Jake Bullet, cybernautic
detective. I like that.

13:06.944 --> 13:08.591
Duane Dibbley?

13:10.200 --> 13:12.634
So, whoever you are, who's next?

13:12.800 --> 13:18.636
- I don't want to know. Someone else look.
- Stand aside. Let the law handle this.

13:19.560 --> 13:23.838
Hmm... No photograph. Name
- Billy Doyle.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.797
Not necessarily. It's
not necessarily me.

13:27.960 --> 13:31.839
Billy Doyle. That's a name from
the wrong side of the tracks.

13:32.700 --> 13:34.816
It's yours.

13:34.980 --> 13:38.609
- What?
- It's yours... Bill.

13:38.820 --> 13:43.052
- No.
- Check the ugly mug on the ID, then, man.

13:43.220 --> 13:45.211
"William Doyle".

13:45.380 --> 13:49.293
William Doyle. Good ol' Bill Doyle.

13:49.460 --> 13:52.691
That sounds like a hell of a good name.

13:52.860 --> 13:57.456
Probably connected with the Boston
Doyles. Old money, blue-chip stock.

13:57.620 --> 13:59.815
It's all coming back to me now.

14:00.900 --> 14:04.575
What puzzles me is why a
man of such good breeding

14:04.740 --> 14:07.023
would be wearing a coat that smells

14:07.024 --> 14:10.610
like an elderly yak has
taken a leak in both pockets.

14:10.780 --> 14:13.419
- Well, isn't it obvious?
- No, it isn't.

14:14.860 --> 14:20.571
Oh, my God. My name is Billy Doyle
and my cologne is Eau de Yak Urine.

14:21.300 --> 14:23.530
So who am I, then?

14:33.620 --> 14:36.180
Wow! Look at my gear!

14:37.580 --> 14:40.253
This stuff's really, really expensive.

14:40.460 --> 14:42.815
Are you sure this isn't my box?

14:43.020 --> 14:48.333
- Who are you? What do you do?
- I work for some company - CGI.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.412
I've got a limo in
the long-term car park.

14:51.580 --> 14:56.017
Clearly, you were privy to all the
breaks that life denied William Doyle.

14:57.060 --> 15:02.737
Sir, I think you should take a look at
this. William, meet your brother Sebastian.

15:05.620 --> 15:10.375
Well, half-brothers.
Uterinal - same mother.

15:12.340 --> 15:17.130
This is a crazy idea. We can't leave
now. Our memories haven't returned yet.

15:17.300 --> 15:23.455
We've got to find out more. I can't be
his alky, yak-coat-wearing half-brother.

15:24.780 --> 15:27.055
Duane Dibbley?!

15:39.100 --> 15:42.490
Are you crazy, Lister?
Are you totally nuts?

15:42.660 --> 15:45.936
You risk everybody's
neck just to save my life?

15:46.100 --> 15:49.137
- Do that again and I'll kill you.
- Hey, Kochanski.

15:51.780 --> 15:53.896
Shut up.

16:08.420 --> 16:13.813
"Vote Fascist for a third glorious
decade of total law enforcement"?!

16:13.980 --> 16:17.689
"Be a government informer.
Betray your family and friends"?

16:17.860 --> 16:20.533
"Fabulous prizes to be won"?!

16:26.540 --> 16:28.531
Here it is.

16:33.380 --> 16:37.009
- This is your car?
- Bay 47.

16:37.220 --> 16:40.735
Halt or I'll fire! Move, voters!

16:40.940 --> 16:45.650
Move one inch and I'll crush
every bone in your body.

16:47.300 --> 16:50.576
You helped an enemy of democracy escape.

16:50.740 --> 16:53.573
She was stealing an apple of the people.

16:54.620 --> 16:58.135
- Bullet, cybernautics.
- That's traffic control.

17:01.300 --> 17:03.655
Kneel, voters.

17:03.820 --> 17:07.050
You are under sentence of death.

17:08.540 --> 17:11.134
Come out of the shadows, voter.

17:11.300 --> 17:14.656
What's the beef? Did
she steal your lunch box?

17:14.819 --> 17:19.176
Many apologies, Voter Colonel.
Had I known it was you...

17:22.579 --> 17:24.491
- Forgive me.
- You know me?

17:24.700 --> 17:26.816
Of course, Voter Colonel.

17:27.020 --> 17:31.252
- Who am I?
- You are Colonel Sebastian Doyle.

17:31.420 --> 17:36.016
Section chief of CGI. Head
of the Ministry of Alteration.

17:36.220 --> 17:42.090
Remind me a little. What exactly do
we do at the Ministry of Alteration?

17:42.300 --> 17:46.418
You... change people, Voter Colonel.

17:47.380 --> 17:51.578
- In what way?
- You change them from being alive people

17:51.740 --> 17:55.130
to being dead people,
to purify democracy.

17:55.340 --> 17:57.774
- Purify?
- No one has done more

17:57.940 --> 18:01.137
to purge the ballot boxes
than the Voter Colonel.

18:01.340 --> 18:08.018
- So why has he been away for four years?
- Voter Colonel, is this some sort of test?

18:08.220 --> 18:10.017
Answer him.

18:11.020 --> 18:15.855
The rumour was that you had grown
weary of your glorious duties

18:16.020 --> 18:21.458
and had gone away, in
secret, to renew yourself.

18:24.580 --> 18:27.652
Halt!

18:32.940 --> 18:35.090
I killed him.

18:37.900 --> 18:40.016
Lets get out of here! In the car!

18:40.220 --> 18:42.495
- Get in the car!
- I killed him!

18:42.660 --> 18:44.651
We haven't got time for that!

18:44.860 --> 18:48.057
- I killed a human!
- In the car!

18:50.940 --> 18:53.329
Look out! Fascist cops! They're armed.

18:54.180 --> 18:55.852
You're hit!

18:56.060 --> 18:59.939
Hello. For the 3,000th time, you're
hallucinating. Can anyone hear me?

19:00.100 --> 19:02.091
Uh-oh! Speed bumps!

19:06.780 --> 19:08.577
Chicane!

19:11.980 --> 19:13.971
Look out. The barrier.

19:14.220 --> 19:16.575
Brace yourselves!
We're going through it!

19:19.980 --> 19:23.655
Motorcycles. They're carrying
personal rocket launchers.

19:23.860 --> 19:26.693
- That bridge, think we can make it?
- It's raising!

19:26.900 --> 19:30.051
- Got any better ideas?
- Just do it!

19:31.820 --> 19:35.096
Whooooa!

19:38.140 --> 19:42.133
We made it! Nice
driving! So long, suckers!

19:43.980 --> 19:46.540
Uh-oh! Helicopters.

19:47.940 --> 19:51.012
Oh, I'm going to have to dump the limo!

19:53.660 --> 19:56.493
OK! Come on! Go! Go! Go!

20:00.460 --> 20:02.849
Down that alley!

20:10.780 --> 20:13.578
I killed him. I killed a human.

20:14.740 --> 20:16.219
Damn.

20:16.380 --> 20:18.038
What are you doing?!

20:18.039 --> 20:21.579
It is fundamental
that I never take a life.

20:21.740 --> 20:25.528
I could have stunned him.
I must terminate myself.

20:25.700 --> 20:30.569
This is a nightmare. I'm on the
run with a murderer, a mass murderer

20:30.740 --> 20:33.129
and a man in a bri-nylon shirt.

20:33.300 --> 20:38.499
I'm a human-wreckage sputum-bag
who smells like a yak latrine.

20:38.660 --> 20:43.859
Now I'm about to be splattered with an
android's brain. I'm after you with the gun.

20:44.020 --> 20:46.329
- Yeah, count me in too.
- Ditto.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.775
But there's only one bullet left.

20:48.940 --> 20:53.934
We could put our heads together and
the bullet could go down the line.

20:54.140 --> 20:57.928
Kryten, I'm using a higher
frequency. Can you hear me now?

20:58.140 --> 21:02.372
- Did somebody say something?
- You're hallucinating. Put the gun down.

21:02.580 --> 21:05.811
I think I'm going to put the gun down.

21:06.020 --> 21:11.697
- Walk forward three paces.
- I'm going to walk forward three paces.

21:12.820 --> 21:14.554
Well, he's cracking up.

21:14.555 --> 21:17.814
I'm going to pick up
this fire extinguisher

21:18.020 --> 21:20.250
and twist the release wheel.

21:20.460 --> 21:22.610
Have you quite finished being strange?

21:25.260 --> 21:29.048
I'm sorry, sir. I don't
know what came over me.

21:31.020 --> 21:33.250
- OK?
- OK.

21:33.420 --> 21:35.695
You're hallucinating.

21:35.900 --> 21:37.891
You're hallucinating.

21:38.060 --> 21:40.130
- What?
- You almost didn't make it.

21:40.340 --> 21:42.649
- Welcome back.
- What happened?

21:42.860 --> 21:47.012
You had a group hallucination,
brought on by the Despair Squid.

21:47.180 --> 21:53.096
You were about to commit suicide
until the mood-stabiliser saved you.

21:53.260 --> 21:56.889
- The lithium carbonate.
- We really would have killed ourselves?

21:57.060 --> 22:01.611
Of course. The hallucinations
were designed to induce despair.

22:01.780 --> 22:06.900
To attack the very things we each
consider quintessential to our self-esteem.

22:07.060 --> 22:11.656
Take Mr Rimmer. He could no longer
blame his failings on his parents,

22:11.860 --> 22:15.978
because he shared an upbringing with you,
his richer, more important half-brother.

22:16.140 --> 22:19.655
Cat lost his cool, and life
no longer had any meaning

22:19.820 --> 22:22.050
because he is so
mind-meltingly shallow.

22:22.260 --> 22:25.138
Right. Superficial is my middle name.

22:25.900 --> 22:30.974
And you have always prided yourself
on being a man of moral courage.

22:31.140 --> 22:33.966
So, when you thought
you were a mass-murderer

22:33.967 --> 22:36.055
in a totalitarian state, despair.

22:36.220 --> 22:39.098
Despair destined to
drive you over the edge.

22:39.980 --> 22:43.859
- And with you it was taking a human life.
- Precisely.

22:44.060 --> 22:47.018
- I'm not Duane Dibbley?
- No.

22:47.220 --> 22:49.211
I AM Rimmer?

22:49.380 --> 22:51.177
I'm afraid so.

22:52.140 --> 22:56.850
- What happened to the Despair Squid?
- I took care of that. Limpet mines.

22:57.020 --> 22:59.898
The fried calamari out
there could feed Italy.

23:00.100 --> 23:03.536
- Let's get out of here.
- Flight coordinates programmed.

23:03.700 --> 23:06.134
Switching to pilot
cooperation until we surface.

23:08.180 --> 23:13.459
Those planet engineers really screwed up
in a big way here, didn't they? Playing God.

23:13.660 --> 23:19.257
The evolutionary process threw up a life
form more deadly than any other species.

23:19.420 --> 23:22.173
Damn near wiped out
everything on the planet.

23:22.340 --> 23:26.333
Spreading despair and destruction
wherever it stuck its ugly mush.

23:26.340 --> 23:29.015
Hmm, sounds rather
reminiscent of a species

23:29.016 --> 23:31.812
sitting not a million
miles away from me now.

23:34.940 --> 23:38.774
You probably have to be a
mechanoid to appreciate that one.

23:39.460 --> 23:42.258
Kryten, no one likes
a smart alec android.

23:42.460 --> 23:44.690
Hit the retros.

23:44.860 --> 23:46.851
We're on our way, sir.
