WEBVTT

00:43.460 --> 00:46.963
This is the first one that I started
when I was 13.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.299
And it says,

00:49.382 --> 00:53.094
"My life, my career, my... my dream...

00:53.178 --> 00:55.055
...my reality."

00:57.223 --> 01:00.143
For a while, I wrote with quill and ink.

01:00.226 --> 01:03.021
That was a phase I went through.
Like, I had a glass quill

01:03.146 --> 01:04.688
with, like, an ink jet.

01:07.525 --> 01:11.529
You know, my entire moral code,
as a kid and now,

01:12.155 --> 01:15.658
is a need to be thought of as good.

01:15.992 --> 01:18.828
That's dangerous. That's not...
That's dangerous for you.

01:20.246 --> 01:23.083
It was all I wrote about.
It was all I wanted.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.918
It was the complete and total...

01:25.585 --> 01:28.088
belief system
that I subscribed to as a kid.

01:30.006 --> 01:31.382
Do the right thing.

01:31.466 --> 01:32.926
Do the good thing.

01:33.009 --> 01:36.513
And obviously,
I'm not a perfect person by any stretch,

01:36.596 --> 01:40.475
but overall, the main thing
that I always tried to be was...

01:40.975 --> 01:41.975
um...

01:43.269 --> 01:44.479
like, just...

01:45.313 --> 01:46.356
like, a good girl.

01:51.569 --> 01:53.947
<i>And now,
to perform the national anthem,</i>

01:54.030 --> 01:57.617
<i>a multitalented performing artist

01:58.618 --> 02:00.703
<i>Please welcome Taylor Swift!</i>

02:00.787 --> 02:03.790
Hey, everybody.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.542
- Um...
- Hi, Taylor.

02:05.625 --> 02:06.668
You know,

02:06.751 --> 02:10.880
one of my first memories of country music
was when I was six years old,

02:10.964 --> 02:13.299
and my parents took me
to see LeAnn Rimes in concert.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.135
Guitar!

02:15.218 --> 02:18.346
I... am...

02:19.013 --> 02:20.013

02:20.306 --> 02:22.142
<i>...twelve-year-old Taylor Swift!</i>

02:22.225 --> 02:23.101
Whoo!

02:23.184 --> 02:25.064
Hey, everybody. I'm Taylor.

02:25.436 --> 02:30.066
<i>I'd been trained to be happy
when you get a lot of praise.</i>

02:30.567 --> 02:31.860
Hi, Taylor.

02:32.235 --> 02:35.989
See, that's...
that's Sony Music, right there.

02:36.406 --> 02:40.160
Sony is gonna listen to her CD today.

02:42.245 --> 02:46.374
<i>I had that praise of, "Taylor,
you're doing a good job at your work."</i>

02:46.457 --> 02:50.044
Hey, this is Taylor Swift, and thanks

<i>Like, those pats on the head
were all I lived for.</i>

02:58.303 --> 03:01.097

'cause it's my home video, but...

03:01.181 --> 03:02.557

10:55.279 --> 10:57.990

I-I'm really happy for you.

17:02.146 --> 17:04.565
One of the best videos of all time!

17:16.577 --> 17:17.869
I was standing onstage,

17:17.953 --> 17:21.707
and I was really excited
because I had just won the award,

17:21.790 --> 17:24.960
and then I was really excited
because Kanye West was on the stage.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.211
And then I, um...

17:27.003 --> 17:28.714
then I wasn't so excited anymore.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.306
Hey, Taylor,
are there any hard feelings towards him?

17:37.556 --> 17:40.684
I-I don't know him,
and I-I've never met him, so...

17:40.768 --> 17:42.936
- So, were you a fan before?
- Um...

17:43.479 --> 17:44.959
- ...yeah.
- Oh.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.149
- He's Kanye West.
- Mm-hmm.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.151
Are you still a fan? I take it no?

17:49.318 --> 17:52.047
You know, I just... I don't know him,
and I don't wanna start anything

17:52.071 --> 17:54.865
'cause I just, you know,
I had a great night tonight.

17:54.948 --> 17:57.618
Everyone is talking
about this Kanye West thing, aren't they?

17:57.701 --> 17:58.869
In case you're lucky enough

17:58.952 --> 18:01.914
to have missed it,
Kanye West interrupted a young singer

18:01.997 --> 18:03.332
named Taylor Swift while she...

18:03.415 --> 18:06.585
President Obama
calling Kanye West a "jackass."

18:06.668 --> 18:09.171
I can name you ten or 15 people

18:09.254 --> 18:11.590
that he wouldn't have gone up
and taken that mic away from.

18:11.673 --> 18:14.551
But he did it with a 17-year-old girl
because he could.

18:20.974 --> 18:22.893
It was so echoey in there.

18:23.727 --> 18:26.522
At the time, I didn't know
they were booing <i>him </i> doing that.

18:27.022 --> 18:28.774
I thought that they were booing <i>me.</i>

18:29.483 --> 18:32.569

their whole belief system

18:32.653 --> 18:35.739

18:36.573 --> 18:38.200
the whole crowd booing...

18:38.659 --> 18:39.743

23:06.259 --> 23:10.305

I just had never tried one.

23:35.372 --> 23:37.833
Twenty-nine? I remember those days.

23:42.462 --> 23:43.672
How do you feel about that?

23:44.423 --> 23:45.465
I mean...

23:46.383 --> 23:48.552
yeah, there's a part of me
that feels like I'm 57,

23:48.635 --> 23:50.195
but there's a part of me that's like...

23:52.431 --> 23:54.141
definitely not ready to have kids,

23:54.224 --> 23:56.309
definitely not ready
for all this grown-up stuff.

23:56.393 --> 23:57.477
- Yeah.
- So...

23:58.645 --> 24:01.189
I don't think anybody's ever ready
for that stuff.

24:01.606 --> 24:04.109
You just figure it out
when it happens.

24:04.317 --> 24:07.195
I kind of don't really have
the luxury of...

24:07.696 --> 24:10.490
...figuring stuff out
because my life is planned, like, in...

24:10.574 --> 24:12.334
- like, two years ahead of time.
- Mm.

24:12.367 --> 24:13.743
Like, literally, in two months,

24:13.827 --> 24:15.867
they'll come to me with the dates
for the next tour.

24:15.912 --> 24:17.789
- Right.
- They'll be like, "So...

24:18.039 --> 24:19.958
you'll be at Foxborough Stadium,

24:20.041 --> 24:22.794

or whatever year, you know?

24:22.878 --> 24:24.296
- Like, it's...
- Wow. Yeah.

24:26.006 --> 24:27.174
So, yeah.

24:30.969 --> 24:33.472

24:42.564 --> 24:43.564

24:44.274 --> 24:45.692
- Incoming.
- Yup.

24:45.775 --> 24:47.527

24:47.611 --> 24:49.446
- Whoa. Oh.
- Oh, no!

24:49.529 --> 24:50.780
No!

24:51.907 --> 24:53.867
Not the steak!

24:53.950 --> 24:55.452
No, no, not on your forehead!

24:55.535 --> 24:58.872
Yeah, well, I don't know. I...
Either that or the lap. I don't know.

24:58.955 --> 25:01.058
- Oh, shit.
- This is a Rihanna shirt.

25:01.082 --> 25:02.751
Oh, my God, it's all over me.

25:03.418 --> 25:06.046
Want a bite? Want a bite?

25:06.546 --> 25:08.590
She goes, "What is the panic?"

25:09.466 --> 25:13.178
She did a better job of bracing herself
for takeoff than we did.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.931
It is like traveling
with a pony.

25:16.806 --> 25:17.974
But I love her.

25:18.058 --> 25:20.185
- Oh, I know.
- But I love her.

25:20.268 --> 25:24.022
She's... Okay, so what you're...
what you're seeing here... is...

25:24.105 --> 25:27.275
...is exactly what Mom decided to do

25:27.359 --> 25:29.152
when both of her kids were out
of the house.

25:29.236 --> 25:33.782
She decided to get a third child,
like, a human-sized dog.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.825
She's actually my cancer dog.

25:36.201 --> 25:39.120
After I... found that out, I...

25:40.413 --> 25:41.873
I decided to, um...

25:43.166 --> 25:45.835
to do something I'd always wanted to do,
which was...

25:46.711 --> 25:48.088
get a-a really big dog.

25:49.172 --> 25:51.341
- That's good, Mom.
- Yeah. Well, that's what it is.

25:51.424 --> 25:54.094
I'm happy that worked out for you.
I'm sor... sorry you had cancer.

25:54.177 --> 25:56.846
I'm sorry.
That's really what it is.

25:58.807 --> 26:01.601
<i>She got cancer several years ago.</i>

26:02.310 --> 26:05.063

26:14.114 --> 26:15.490
Like, into the microphone.

26:19.327 --> 26:21.162
<i>It woke me up from this...</i>

26:21.663 --> 26:24.082

26:24.374 --> 26:26.334
- Hi, Dad.
- How you doing, babe?

26:26.543 --> 26:29.004
<i>But, like, do you really care</i>

26:29.588 --> 26:32.132

27:03.580 --> 27:05.915
Can I get some white wine?
Oh, you got the red wine?

27:05.999 --> 27:08.477
- Does that make me a difficult guest?
- It's for the recipe.

27:08.501 --> 27:10.420
I'm happy to switch.
It's too adult for me,

27:10.503 --> 27:11.963
- let's be honest.
- Yeah.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.466
Oh.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.718
And... ah, yes.

27:16.801 --> 27:17.927
Okay, that's dinner.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.824
I'm gonna get some ice
for my wine. You want any?

27:21.848 --> 27:22.848
Yeah.

27:24.351 --> 27:26.978
Oh, that's fine.
That's honestly just what I wanted.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.938
- Yeah.
- You're like... "Uh..."

27:29.022 --> 27:30.065
Eh.

27:30.899 --> 27:33.002
- You know, Claire just had a baby.
- Mm-hmm.

27:33.026 --> 27:35.278
And, like, I went over to see her, and...

27:36.029 --> 27:37.149
How's she doing...

27:37.197 --> 27:38.716
- She was just...
- ...with motherhood?

27:38.740 --> 27:40.825
Well, she's the best 'cause she's like,

27:40.909 --> 27:44.371
"Just so you know, this is what it is.

27:44.454 --> 27:48.166
- You feed 'em, change 'em, they sleep.
- Yeah.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.437
- You feed 'em, change 'em, they sleep.
- You do it all over. Yeah.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.797
- You feed 'em." Like...
- It's just...

27:53.880 --> 27:56.383
She's... And I was like,
"So, it's like a Tamagotchi?"

27:56.466 --> 27:58.593
- Oh, my God.
- Like...

27:59.344 --> 28:01.262
- Like, exactly, so...
- Yeah.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.890
- You'd be an excellent mother.
- Thanks.

28:03.973 --> 28:05.058
No questions.

28:05.141 --> 28:08.353
Mmm. Mmm. This is so good.

28:10.146 --> 28:12.375
- I'm gone for a month after this.
- Mm.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.449
- We got three.
- Okay.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.575
Huh?

28:23.868 --> 28:24.911
Three paps.

28:24.994 --> 28:27.080
- Three?
- Three paps now.

28:27.163 --> 28:29.082
Three of 'em, you say?

28:29.165 --> 28:32.669
Well, good luck sellin' this picture.

28:47.642 --> 28:49.894
Oh, my God!

28:58.486 --> 28:59.946
Taylor!

29:00.029 --> 29:01.531
I love you!

29:02.073 --> 29:03.073
Well...

29:04.617 --> 29:06.745
So, this is my front yard...

29:09.581 --> 29:10.790
...and...

29:11.332 --> 29:14.043
I'm highly aware of the fact that
that is not normal.

29:16.045 --> 29:17.714
I've learned over the years...

29:19.883 --> 29:22.135
...it's not good for me

29:22.218 --> 29:26.222
to see pictures of myself every day

29:26.306 --> 29:27.766
'cause I have a tendency,

29:28.183 --> 29:29.601
and it's only happened...

29:31.060 --> 29:33.897
a few times,
and I'm not in any way proud of it,

29:33.980 --> 29:35.064
but I get...

29:35.148 --> 29:38.860
I tend to get triggered by something,
whether it's a picture of me

29:38.943 --> 29:41.738
where I feel like I looked like my tummy
was too big

29:41.821 --> 29:45.784
or... or, like, someone said
that I looked pregnant or something,

29:45.867 --> 29:47.786
and that'll just trigger me to just...

29:48.411 --> 29:52.373
s-starve a little bit, just stop eating.

29:55.210 --> 29:58.171
I thought that I was just, like,
supposed to feel like I was gonna pass out

29:58.254 --> 30:00.048
at the end of a show
or in the middle of it.

30:00.131 --> 30:01.508
I thought that was how it was,

30:01.591 --> 30:02.592
and now I realize:

30:02.675 --> 30:06.262
no, if you eat food, have energy,
get stronger,

30:06.346 --> 30:09.265
you can do all these shows
and not feel it.

30:10.350 --> 30:11.684
Which is...

30:11.768 --> 30:13.311
...a really good revelation...

30:13.937 --> 30:18.441
because I'm a lot happier with who I am,
and I'm happier with, like...

30:18.525 --> 30:19.525
I don't...

30:19.943 --> 30:21.611
I don't care as much if, like...

30:22.237 --> 30:24.489
somebody points out
that I have gained weight.

30:24.572 --> 30:27.534
It's just something
that makes my life better,

30:27.659 --> 30:29.828
the fact that I'm, you know...

30:30.995 --> 30:33.832
I'm a size six
instead of a size double zero.

30:34.457 --> 30:38.169
I mean, that... that wasn't...
how my body was supposed to be.

30:38.253 --> 30:39.712
I just didn't really...

30:40.505 --> 30:43.758
understand that a-at the time.
I really don't think I knew it.

30:44.843 --> 30:48.847
I would've defended it to anyone
who said, "I'm concerned about you."

30:48.930 --> 30:51.182
I was like, "What are you talking about?
Of course I eat.

30:51.266 --> 30:53.601
It's perfectly normal.
I just exercise a lot."

30:54.310 --> 30:57.021
And I did exercise a lot,
but I wasn't eating.

30:57.981 --> 30:58.981
And...

30:59.732 --> 31:01.401
you can't...

31:01.609 --> 31:02.610
I just...

31:04.404 --> 31:08.658
I don't think you know you're doing that
when you're doing it gradually.

31:10.159 --> 31:12.287
There's always some standard of beauty

31:12.370 --> 31:13.788
that you're not meeting.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.374
'Cause if you're thin enough

31:16.457 --> 31:18.918
then you don't have that ass
that everybody wants.

31:19.002 --> 31:21.588
But if you have enough weight on you
to have an ass,

31:21.671 --> 31:23.548
then your stomach isn't flat enough.

31:23.965 --> 31:25.383
It's all just...

31:26.843 --> 31:28.803
fucking impossible.

31:30.597 --> 31:33.242
You don't ever say to yourself,
"Look, I've got an eating disorder,"

31:33.266 --> 31:35.706
but you know you're, like,
making a list of everything you put

31:35.768 --> 31:38.354
in your mouth that day,
and you know that's probably not right,

31:38.438 --> 31:41.357
but then again, there's so many diet blogs
that tell you that that...

31:41.441 --> 31:43.109
that that's what you should do.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.989
This would cause me to go into, like,
a real shame...

31:48.072 --> 31:49.198
like, hate spiral.

31:49.741 --> 31:50.575
This.

31:50.658 --> 31:53.661
And, like, I caught myself yesterday
starting to do it, and I was like,

31:53.745 --> 31:56.581
"Nope, we don't do that anymore.
We do not do that anymore,

31:56.664 --> 31:58.791
because it's better to look...

31:58.875 --> 32:01.419
to think you look fat
than to look sick.

32:01.836 --> 32:04.964
And we don't do that anymore,
and you just...

32:05.048 --> 32:07.342
We're just...
We're changing the channel in our brain,

32:07.425 --> 32:09.719
and we're not...
we're not doin' that anymore.

32:10.053 --> 32:12.055
That didn't end us up in a good place."

32:15.767 --> 32:19.354
As your career goes like this,
the magnifying glass goes like that.

32:22.315 --> 32:24.901
Taylor Swift could not take herself
more seriously.

32:24.984 --> 32:27.779
I think
that there's plenty of annoying women.

32:27.862 --> 32:30.323
I-I think that Taylor Swift,
she is annoying.

32:30.406 --> 32:33.701
She's too good.
She's too skinny. It bothers me.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.663
All of her model friends.
And it's just like, come on!

32:36.746 --> 32:37.866
Lock and load, boys.

32:37.914 --> 32:39.666
Yo, Taylor!
You fucked him, Taylor?

32:39.749 --> 32:42.269
We've got a roundup
of the guys that Miss Swifty has

32:42.293 --> 32:43.962
at one point been romantic with,

32:44.045 --> 32:46.506
and there are a lot of hotties
on this list.

32:46.589 --> 32:48.091
Holy date life.

32:48.174 --> 32:49.592
...meet the parents?

32:49.676 --> 32:52.595
She's going through guys like a train.

32:52.679 --> 32:54.847
- Can we get a pan down?
- It's beautiful.

32:54.931 --> 32:57.725
I wanted to show the legs,
'cause as I was telling you,

32:57.809 --> 33:00.436
you're gonna walk home with more
than maybe just a trophy tonight.

33:00.520 --> 33:01.562
I think lots of men.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.564
I'm not gonna walk home
with any men tonight.

33:05.149 --> 33:06.567
Watch... watch out, guys!

33:06.651 --> 33:09.070
We give you the latest
can't-look-away twist

33:09.153 --> 33:11.489
in one of America's
favorite celebrity feuds.

33:11.572 --> 33:13.372
<i>Kanye West
recently dissed Taylor</i>

33:13.449 --> 33:14.492
<i>in his new song, "Famous."</i>

33:14.575 --> 33:18.913
The song contains a lyric
calling Taylor Swift the b-word.

33:19.288 --> 33:21.749
<i>♪ I feel like me and Taylor
Might still have sex ♪</i>

33:21.833 --> 33:23.918
<i>♪ Why? I made that bitch famous ♪</i>

33:24.002 --> 33:26.754
Kanye had said all along
that he got permission. Taylor denied it.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.799
<i>Kim Kardashian released video
of Kanye West</i>

33:29.882 --> 33:32.093
<i>secretly recording his conversation.</i>

33:32.176 --> 33:35.138
<i>I mean, thanks for being,
like, so cool about it.</i>

33:35.430 --> 33:37.491
- <i>Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.</i>

33:37.515 --> 33:41.144
<i>Um, yeah, I really appreciate it.
Like, the heads-up is so nice.</i>

33:41.519 --> 33:44.564
She posted on Instagram,
"Where in the video is Kanye telling me

33:44.647 --> 33:45.807
he was gonna call me 'that...

33:45.857 --> 33:47.501
- biatch' in his song?"
- Yeah.

33:47.525 --> 33:48.605
<i>Swift writing,</i>

33:48.651 --> 33:51.821
<i>"I would very much like to be excluded
from this narrative,</i>

33:51.904 --> 33:55.575
<i>one that I have never asked
to be a part of, since 2009."</i>

33:55.658 --> 33:59.620
I don't buy the story
that she was so insulted by that one line.

33:59.704 --> 34:03.082
I think she saw an opportunity
to be victimized here,

34:03.166 --> 34:05.585
and she thought
everybody was gonna get on her side.

34:05.668 --> 34:08.795

34:08.880 --> 34:10.715

34:17.096 --> 34:22.935
Fuck Taylor Swift! Fuck Taylor Swift!
Fuck Taylor Swift! Fuck Taylor Swift!

34:31.819 --> 34:33.696
When people decided I was...

34:35.322 --> 34:38.826
wicked and evil and conniving

34:38.909 --> 34:41.329
and not... a good person,

34:41.913 --> 34:44.373
that was the one
that I couldn't really bounce back from

34:44.456 --> 34:46.793
'cause my whole life was centered
around it.

34:54.175 --> 34:56.886
#TaylorSwiftIsOverParty
was the number one trend

34:56.969 --> 34:58.179
on Twitter worldwide.

35:00.848 --> 35:04.018
Know how many people have to be tweeting
that they hate you for that to happen?

35:17.573 --> 35:19.325
We're people who got
into this line of work

35:19.408 --> 35:20.993
because we wanted people to like us,

35:21.077 --> 35:23.454
'cause we were intrinsically insecure,

35:23.538 --> 35:26.040
because we liked the sound
of people clapping

35:26.124 --> 35:28.918
'cause it made us forget how much
we feel like we're not good enough.

35:29.001 --> 35:32.755
And I've been doing this for 15 years,
and it's just, I'm tired of it.

35:33.256 --> 35:35.007
I'm just tired of the...

35:36.092 --> 35:37.927
...just...

35:41.097 --> 35:44.517
...it just feels like it's
more than music now at this point.

35:44.851 --> 35:47.228
And, just, most days, I'm like, "Okay."

35:47.311 --> 35:49.355
But then sometimes, I'm just like...

35:53.276 --> 35:55.903
...it just gets loud sometimes.

48:01.378 --> 48:03.171
I really, really care about my home state,

48:03.255 --> 48:04.965
and I know that in this...

48:05.382 --> 48:06.967
at this point in time, like,

48:07.384 --> 48:09.636
my home state is a huge,

48:10.178 --> 48:12.347
hugely important part
of this midterm election.

48:12.431 --> 48:16.101
Tennessee's US senate race
figures to be crucial

48:16.184 --> 48:19.646
in both parties' efforts to try
to control the US Senate after this year.

48:19.730 --> 48:23.317
Marsha Blackburn,
a self-described hard-core conservative,

48:23.400 --> 48:26.194
proclaims her support
for President Trump often.

48:26.278 --> 48:31.450
I know the left calls me "a wingnut"
or "a knuckle-dragging conservative."

48:31.533 --> 48:34.453
And you know what? I say,
"That's all right. Bring it on."

48:35.037 --> 48:37.307
One of the things that, like,
outraged me so much

48:37.331 --> 48:40.000
is that she voted
against the reauthorization

48:40.083 --> 48:41.627
of the Violence Against Women Act,

48:41.710 --> 48:44.463
which tries to protect women
from stalking,

48:44.546 --> 48:46.214
from date rape, from domestic violence.

48:46.298 --> 48:48.884
And then, obviously,
it's a no for gay marriage,

48:48.967 --> 48:51.553
it's a no
for them to have any rights whatsoever.

48:53.180 --> 48:54.806
I think I'll be really upset...

48:55.223 --> 48:57.559
if people think that Tennessee...

48:59.353 --> 49:01.021
stands for those things.

49:07.819 --> 49:10.322
You've been very secretive
about how you vote,

49:10.405 --> 49:11.531
what you're voting for.

49:11.615 --> 49:14.993
Well, I mean,
I just figure, I'm a 22-year-old singer,

49:15.077 --> 49:16.828
and, you know, I don't know

49:16.912 --> 49:19.373
if people really want to hear
my political views.

49:19.456 --> 49:21.496
I think they kind of just want
to hear me sing songs

49:21.541 --> 49:24.002
about breakups and feelings.

49:25.879 --> 49:28.298
<i>Part of the fabric

49:34.888 --> 49:36.723
<i>That is grilled into us.</i>

49:38.058 --> 49:39.935
These three women have been
the reigning queens

49:40.018 --> 49:41.436
of pop and country music.

49:41.520 --> 49:44.272
They're the biggest-selling female artists
of all time,

49:44.356 --> 49:47.526
nearly 30 million records sold
and even more fans

49:47.609 --> 49:50.237
who always used to love
their high-spirited style,

49:50.320 --> 49:52.656
their music, and their moxie.

49:54.241 --> 49:56.618
Well, that racy magazine cover
on the stands today

49:56.702 --> 49:58.453
pretty much sums up
some of the names

49:58.537 --> 50:01.456
the Dixie Chicks are being called
in America these days:

50:01.540 --> 50:04.501
"traitors, the Dixie Sluts,
anti-American,"

50:05.002 --> 50:07.087
all because of one split-second comment

50:07.170 --> 50:10.048
aimed at President Bush
right before the war with Iraq.

50:16.596 --> 50:17.889
Their opinion is so ignorant.

50:17.973 --> 50:19.653
They don't know
what they're talking about.

50:19.725 --> 50:22.185
I think they are the Ditzy Twits.

50:22.269 --> 50:25.731
These are the dumbest, dumbest bimbos,
with due respect, I have seen.

50:25.814 --> 50:28.734
These are callow, foolish women
who deserve to be slapped around.

50:28.817 --> 50:29.901
Absolutely.

50:33.655 --> 50:35.095
<i>Throughout my whole career,</i>

50:35.157 --> 50:38.160
<i>label executives
and publishers would just say,</i>

50:38.702 --> 50:40.370
<i>"Don't be like the Dixie Chicks."</i>

50:40.454 --> 50:43.665
<i>And... I loved the Dixie Chicks.</i>

50:47.377 --> 50:51.131
<i>But a nice girl doesn't force
their opinions on people.</i>

50:51.715 --> 50:53.800
<i>A nice girl smiles and waves</i>

50:53.884 --> 50:55.177
<i>and says thank you.</i>

50:55.343 --> 50:59.431
<i>A nice girl doesn't make people feel
uncomfortable with her views.</i>

51:00.098 --> 51:01.224
It's my right to vote,

51:01.308 --> 51:04.394
but it's not my right
to tell other people what to do.

51:04.478 --> 51:06.354
- Right there, sister.
- Yes, thank you.

51:06.438 --> 51:08.356
- Come on. Come on. Come on!
- All right.

51:10.817 --> 51:13.779
<i>I was so obsessed
with not getting in trouble,</i>

51:13.862 --> 51:14.863
<i>that I was like,</i>

51:14.946 --> 51:18.617
<i>"I'm just not gonna do anything
that anyone could say anything about."</i>

51:28.043 --> 51:29.628
I'm just getting... I'm just...

51:29.920 --> 51:32.172
I'm getting to the point where I can't...

51:33.006 --> 51:35.342
listen to people telling me,
"No, stay out of it.

51:35.425 --> 51:36.593
Stay out of it."

51:44.392 --> 51:46.770
- Yeah. Is that right? C to the A minor?
- Yeah.

51:46.853 --> 51:48.813
Let me... just...
Can you not play for one second?

51:48.855 --> 51:51.334
'Cause I'm trying to figure out this...
I like what I was doing,

51:51.358 --> 51:53.235
but I can't figure out what key it was in.

51:53.318 --> 51:55.654
It's like 4:00 a.m.,

52:35.152 --> 52:37.571

Do you wanna start...
Maybe if you start a vibe...

52:55.881 --> 52:58.258
- Yeah.
- ...then this'll just write itself.

53:00.635 --> 53:01.928
It must be so exhausting.

53:02.429 --> 53:05.432
You must have to be thinking
about this shit all the fucking time.

53:05.515 --> 53:09.603
You are kind of doing a constant strategy
in your head

53:09.686 --> 53:12.272
as to how not to be shamed
for something...

53:12.355 --> 53:14.024
- Yeah.
- ...on any given day.

53:14.733 --> 53:17.277
But then you get accused

53:17.360 --> 53:19.070
- for having a strategy.
- Mm.

53:19.863 --> 53:22.449
- So, it's like...
- It's just a lose-lose situation.

53:22.532 --> 53:23.533
Yeah, it's...

53:24.034 --> 53:26.494
I mean, I'm good, but it's been, uh...

53:26.953 --> 53:29.456
You sort of do have to twist yourself
into a pretzel

53:29.539 --> 53:32.292
- on an hourly basis.
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

53:32.792 --> 53:34.628
Do you like this for a second verse?

53:35.003 --> 53:37.881
Lyric: "They'd say I hustled,
put in the work,

53:38.215 --> 53:41.551
instead of shake their heads
and question how much of this I deserve.

53:41.635 --> 53:44.054
And what was I wearing,
or if I was rude.

53:44.137 --> 53:45.805

53:56.274 --> 53:58.026
- That sounds...

<i>♪ Could all be separated

54:03.698 --> 54:05.242

54:13.124 --> 54:15.877
Just more movement.

54:19.256 --> 54:20.423
That's really cool.

54:22.342 --> 54:25.095

Taylor Swift the singer,
she goes to court today

55:20.650 --> 55:23.778
against a former radio DJ
she says once groped her.

55:24.487 --> 55:26.698
<i>Swift says this picture
shows the moment</i>

55:26.781 --> 55:30.535
<i>Mueller inappropriately grabbed her,
putting his hand up her skirt.</i>

55:31.328 --> 55:34.122
<i>This had happened to me.
We told his boss.</i>

55:34.539 --> 55:36.916
<i>They did an investigation.
He got fired,</i>

55:37.584 --> 55:39.586
<i>then he sued me for millions of dollars,</i>

55:39.669 --> 55:41.421
<i>so I countersued for one dollar.</i>

55:46.676 --> 55:48.428
<i>You walk into a courtroom,</i>

55:49.012 --> 55:53.266
<i>and then there's this person
sitting in a swivel chair,</i>

55:53.350 --> 55:56.061
<i>staring at you
like </i> you <i> did something to </i> him.

56:00.440 --> 56:02.817
<i>The first thing they say to you in court</i>

56:03.485 --> 56:05.278
<i>is, "Why didn't you scream?</i>

56:06.780 --> 56:08.323
<i>Why didn't you react quicker?</i>

56:09.407 --> 56:11.576
<i>Why didn't you stand
further away from him?"</i>

56:14.329 --> 56:17.582
<i>Then he has a lawyer get up
and just lie.</i>

56:19.793 --> 56:22.796
<i>There were seven people
who saw him do this,</i>

56:22.879 --> 56:24.714
<i>and we had a photo of it happening.</i>

56:26.883 --> 56:28.301
<i>And I was so angry.</i>

56:29.094 --> 56:31.930
<i>I was angry that I had to be there.</i>

56:32.222 --> 56:34.432
<i>I was angry that this happens to women.</i>

56:34.724 --> 56:39.020
<i>I was angry that people are paid
to antagonize victims.</i>

56:39.562 --> 56:42.315
<i>I was angry
that all the details had been twisted.</i>

56:44.818 --> 56:48.446
<i>You don't feel a sense of </i> any <i> victory
when you win...</i>

56:49.155 --> 56:51.741
<i>because the process is so dehumanizing.</i>

56:55.954 --> 56:58.790
<i>This is with seven witnesses and a photo.</i>

56:59.207 --> 57:02.419
<i>What happens when you get raped,
and it's your word against his?</i>

57:16.057 --> 57:19.769
So, um, I just wanted to...

57:21.020 --> 57:22.939
Just kind of looking back, um...

57:23.731 --> 57:27.610
this exact day a year ago, um...

57:31.030 --> 57:31.948
...I was, uh...

57:32.031 --> 57:35.368
I was not playing a sold-out stadium
in Tampa,

57:35.452 --> 57:40.165
I was... I was in a courtroom
in Denver, Colorado, um...

57:44.836 --> 57:48.381
Honestly, I-I was there
for a sexual assault case,

57:48.465 --> 57:49.465
and...

57:49.632 --> 57:54.554
t-this day, a year ago,
was the day that, um...

57:55.680 --> 57:58.850
...uh, the day
that the jury decided in my favor

57:58.933 --> 58:00.560
and said that they believed <i>me.</i>

58:07.817 --> 58:10.445
I guess I just think about all the people
that weren't believed,

58:10.528 --> 58:12.030
people who haven't been believed,

58:12.113 --> 58:15.867
or the people who are afraid to s-speak up
because they think they won't be believed.

58:15.950 --> 58:16.950
And...

58:19.579 --> 58:21.998
And I just...
I just wanted to say that, um...

58:23.166 --> 58:26.044
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
to anyone who ever wasn't believed

58:26.127 --> 58:31.174
because I don't know h... what turn
my life would have taken if somebody'd...

58:31.257 --> 58:32.926
if people didn't believe me

58:33.009 --> 58:35.261
when I said
that something had happened to me.

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:54.108
We are less than three weeks out
until the midterms,

01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:57.570
and Tennessee's senate candidate
Marsha Blackburn is up in the polls.

01:00:57.654 --> 01:00:59.974
Congratulations, I know you've got
a little momentum going.

01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:03.409
This is the third poll in a row
that has shown you in the lead.

01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:08.039
My team's really not happy
with me right now.

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:13.753
All I've talked about for the last couple
of months is the election in Tennessee.

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:15.713
It's not that I want to step into this.

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:18.007
I just...
I can't <i>not </i> at this point. Like...

01:01:18.758 --> 01:01:21.386
something is different in my life,

01:01:21.469 --> 01:01:25.682
completely and unchangeably different
since the sexual assault trial last year.

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:30.436
Like, and no... no man in my organization
or in my family

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:33.356
will ever understand what that was like.

01:01:38.152 --> 01:01:40.321
For 12 years,
we've not got involved

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:41.656
with politics or religion.

01:01:41.739 --> 01:01:43.616
Yeah, but this is on the home front.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.536
And also,
back in the presidential election,

01:01:47.245 --> 01:01:49.914
I was in such a horrendous place

01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:53.126
that I wasn't gonna pop my head
out of the sand for anything.

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:54.210
Why would you?

01:01:54.293 --> 01:01:56.796
I mean, does Bob Hope do it?
Did Bing Crosby do it?

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:59.775
- Does... Does Mick Jagger do it?
- Honey, what the hell? Come on!

01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:02.069
- What I'm saying is...
- Bob Hope and Bing Crosby?

01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:04.178
First of all,
these aren't your dad's celebrities,

01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:05.972
and these aren't your dad's Republicans.

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:09.016
Imagine if we came to you
and said, "Hey, we've got this idea

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:12.195
that we could halve the number of people
that come to your next tour."

01:02:12.937 --> 01:02:15.177
The other thing,
just from a security standpoint,

01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:17.442
"Taylor Swift comes out against Trump."

01:02:17.525 --> 01:02:19.152
I don't care if they write that!

01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:24.031
I'm sad that I didn't two years ago,
but I can't change that.

01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:26.701
I'm saying right now

01:02:26.784 --> 01:02:28.504
that this is something
that I know is right,

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:32.290
and, you guys,
I need to be on the right side of history.

01:02:32.373 --> 01:02:33.374
And if he doesn't win...

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:36.627
- ...then at least I tried.
- Taylor, here's the problem.

01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:39.314
I just want to read you what I wrote,
and I'm gonna try to start...

01:02:39.338 --> 01:02:41.883
I just want you to know
that this is important to me. This is...

01:02:41.966 --> 01:02:43.944
- I totally agree with the issue,
- Have...

01:02:43.968 --> 01:02:45.863
- but let me explain to you...
- Have you heard her?

01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:47.305
I've read the entire thing,

01:02:47.388 --> 01:02:49.766
and the bottom line right now:
I'm terrified.

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:51.809
I'm the guy that went out
and bought armored cars.

01:02:52.351 --> 01:02:55.271
I worry for her safety
as much as anybody does.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:56.605
Maybe more.

01:02:57.565 --> 01:02:59.942
It really is a big deal to me.

01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:03.738
She votes against...
against fair pay for women,

01:03:03.821 --> 01:03:05.865
she votes against
the reauthorization of the...

01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:07.575
of the Violence Against Women Act,

01:03:07.658 --> 01:03:09.452
which is just basically protecting us

01:03:09.535 --> 01:03:11.746
from domestic abuse
and stalking. Stalking!

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:15.625
She votes... She thinks that...
that if you're a gay couple

01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:17.251
or even if you look like a gay couple,

01:03:17.335 --> 01:03:19.837
you should be allowed to be kicked out
of a restaurant.

01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:23.966
It's really basic human rights,
and it's right and wrong at this point,

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:26.636
and I can't see another commercial...

01:03:28.012 --> 01:03:32.308
and see her disguising these policies

01:03:32.391 --> 01:03:35.144
behind the words
"Tennessee Christian values."

01:03:35.228 --> 01:03:37.230
Those aren't Tennessee Christian values.

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:39.857
I live in Tennessee. I am a Christian.

01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:41.400
That's not what we stand for.

01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:44.946
I need to do this. I need you to just...

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:48.708
Dad, I just need you to forgive me
for doing it, 'cause I'm doing it.

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:54.622
- Okay, so...
- I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little nervous.

01:03:54.705 --> 01:03:56.374
- You should be.
- Ooh.

01:03:56.457 --> 01:03:58.334
- I want to do this.
- Okay, so...

01:03:58.709 --> 01:04:01.146
I always have to bring up everything
that could go sideways...

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:02.648
- everything we need to expect.
- Yeah.

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:05.359
- One: the president could come after you.
- Fuck that, I don't care.

01:04:05.383 --> 01:04:07.426
If I get bad press for saying,

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:12.056
"Don't put a homophobic racist in office,"
then I get bad press for that.

01:04:12.139 --> 01:04:14.576
- I really don't care.
- I would stand behind that 1,000 times.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.600
- Me too.
- Yeah.

01:04:15.643 --> 01:04:19.814
I think that it is so frilly
and spineless of me

01:04:19.897 --> 01:04:23.276
to stand onstage and go,
"Happy Pride Month, you guys,"

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:24.902
and then not say this...

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:27.697
when someone's literally coming
for their neck.

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:28.780
Yeah.

01:04:29.615 --> 01:04:31.426
- All right, cheers.
- Cheers, ladies.

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:33.786
- God help us all.
- Cheers to the resistance.

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:36.247
To the resist... Stop it.

01:04:36.581 --> 01:04:38.082
It's gonna be okay.

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:42.378
Oh...

01:04:43.462 --> 01:04:46.007
Oh, my God.

01:04:47.341 --> 01:04:49.343
Oh, it's so scary. This is the picture.

01:04:51.345 --> 01:04:54.140
- One...
- ...two, three...

01:04:54.515 --> 01:04:55.641
...go.

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:59.812
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, my goodness.

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:11.198
Taylor Swift broke her silence
on politics over the weekend,

01:05:11.282 --> 01:05:13.659
publicly backing two Democrats
in Tennessee.

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:16.579
Taylor Swift is taking
her first political stand,

01:05:16.662 --> 01:05:18.414
backing Democrat Phil Bredesen.

01:05:18.497 --> 01:05:23.169
The superstar making it clear
to her 112 million followers on Instagram,

01:05:23.252 --> 01:05:25.546
and the world, where she stands.

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:28.341
Taylor Swift's jumping
into politics. What do you say?

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:32.553
Let's say that I like Taylor's music
about 25% less now, okay?

01:05:33.304 --> 01:05:36.033
<i>The 28-year-old pop star
made her statement on Instagram.</i>

01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:37.857
<i>She broke
her longstanding policy</i>

01:05:37.892 --> 01:05:38.932
<i>of not talking politics...</i>

01:05:38.976 --> 01:05:40.736
<i>...using her voice in a new way.</i>

01:05:40.811 --> 01:05:43.481
<i>This is so out of the norm
for Taylor Swift, who...</i>

01:05:43.564 --> 01:05:45.983
<i>Republicans for years have thought</i>

01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:48.903
<i>that Taylor Swift
was a crypto-conservative, and she just...</i>

01:05:48.986 --> 01:05:51.197
<i>It is a risky move for an entertainer</i>

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.324
<i>to step into politics at her age,</i>

01:05:53.407 --> 01:05:55.910
<i>- at her stage in her career.
- Vote.org reporting</i>

01:05:55.993 --> 01:06:00.164
<i>more registrations in the last day
since Taylor's post than in all of August.</i>

01:06:01.999 --> 01:06:03.960
According to vote.org on Monday,

01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:08.047
nationwide there have been
51,308 new registrations

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:09.715
- in the past 24 hours.
- Whoa!

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:10.967
Yeah!

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:15.262
- So proud of you.
- Congratulations.

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:16.657
- Thank you.
- Go, Taylor.

01:06:16.681 --> 01:06:18.766
Do you think it'll... Do you think...

01:06:19.308 --> 01:06:22.478
I think it could, definitely.
It's your first race, so...

01:06:22.561 --> 01:06:25.856
I really hope it actually,
actually does something.

01:06:26.565 --> 01:06:30.194
But you know what?
Donald Trump likes my music 25% less.

01:06:33.739 --> 01:06:35.282
I feel 200 pounds lighter.

01:06:35.366 --> 01:06:38.452
I just feel like a... I just feel...
I've been feeling this way for months.

01:06:38.536 --> 01:06:39.829
Perez Hilton just posted,

01:06:39.912 --> 01:06:43.165
"Note how Republicans are attacking
Taylor Swift's intelligence

01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:44.500
instead of her ideas.

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:47.211
They don't respect women enough
to debate them."

01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:49.380
Wow.

01:06:49.755 --> 01:06:50.881
It's not not true.

01:06:57.263 --> 01:06:59.306
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:03.978
- Stunning and sexy.
- I look like a melted-down disco ball.

01:07:05.104 --> 01:07:07.773
- I love it.
- My God, you look amazing.

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:09.442
- I am...
- Oh my God.

01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:11.420
- Gorgeous.
- ...a Pop-Tart wrapper.

01:07:12.403 --> 01:07:14.963
- Try this on that ear.
- She's got that...

01:07:14.989 --> 01:07:16.824
You know what?
This is gonna sound ridiculous,

01:07:16.907 --> 01:07:18.719
- but I can't move past here.
- Ooh, you got it.

01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:20.703
You got it.

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:26.000
That's how this dress makes me feel.

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:27.835
- Oh.
- Hmm?

01:07:27.918 --> 01:07:29.118
Can you breathe?

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:31.338
- I can brea... I can.
- Yeah.

01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:33.758
- Is it easy? No.
- The other one's better.

01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:49.815
Don't block her.

01:07:51.108 --> 01:07:53.736
- Taylor! Taylor!
- Taylor!

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.830
To your right! On your right!

01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:11.422
Taylor, look over to your right!

01:08:15.132 --> 01:08:16.466
Thank you for this.

01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:18.886
And I just wanted to make a mention
of the fact

01:08:18.969 --> 01:08:22.598
that this award
and every single award given out tonight

01:08:23.307 --> 01:08:24.767
were voted on by the people.

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:27.144
And you know what else is voted on
by the people...

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:32.733
...is the midterm elections
on November 6th.

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:34.109
Get out and vote. I love you.

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:45.621
Pre-chorus.
Six, seven, eight.

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:48.348
One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

01:08:48.415 --> 01:08:50.084
One, two, three, four five,

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:53.587
six, seven, eight. Three!
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:56.006
Chorus.
Six, seven, eight.

01:08:58.509 --> 01:09:00.176
Yeah, I need to work on my face.

01:09:01.554 --> 01:09:04.557
I look like I have a mean face sometimes
when I'm not trying to.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.808
Know what I mean?

01:09:07.852 --> 01:09:08.852
Um...

01:09:10.187 --> 01:09:12.606
I think you might be more sensitive
than me to that.

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:15.024
Yeah, I have a really slappable face.

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:17.694
- Slappable? Ouch!
- Yeah, you just want to be like...

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:19.363
"What are you plotting?

01:09:19.779 --> 01:09:22.575
What's she planning?"
I'm not meaning to look like that.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.118
You looked confident and strong.
It's the chorus.

01:09:25.202 --> 01:09:27.037
You got it. All right, we'll...

01:09:27.121 --> 01:09:29.247
I'm gonna try to be more likable
on the next one.

01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:30.875
All right, all right. Perfect.

01:09:32.126 --> 01:09:35.296
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight. One...

01:09:36.046 --> 01:09:40.593
I wish I didn't feel like
there's a better version of me out there.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:42.553
I feel that way all the time.

01:09:43.636 --> 01:09:46.473
You know what we call this?
This is "last rhino of the stampede,"

01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:48.434
up here, just...

01:09:48.893 --> 01:09:51.604
Everybody else is runnin'. Limping.

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:53.689
First to get eaten.

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:57.067
I keep looking down
because I'm afraid.

01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:58.277
Afrai...?

01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.361
And it shows.

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:03.949
It's a lot to process
because we do exist in this society

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:08.162
where women in entertainment
are discarded in an elephant graveyard

01:10:08.245 --> 01:10:10.365
by the time they're 35.

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:13.459
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:15.544
Three!

01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:20.507
Everyone's a shiny, new toy
for, like, two years.

01:10:32.686 --> 01:10:34.366
The female artists that I know of

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:38.651
have reinvented themselves 20 times more
than the male artists.

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:40.694
They have to...

01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:43.239
or else you're out of a job.

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:47.534
Constantly having to reinvent,

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:53.457
constantly finding new facets of yourself
that people find to be shiny.

01:10:54.792 --> 01:10:58.379
Be new to us, be young to us,

01:10:58.963 --> 01:11:01.590
but only in a new way
and only in the way we want.

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:03.092
And reinvent yourself,

01:11:03.175 --> 01:11:05.469
but only in a way
that we find to be equally comforting

01:11:05.552 --> 01:11:07.137
but also a challenge for you.

01:11:09.306 --> 01:11:10.474
Live out a narrative

01:11:10.557 --> 01:11:13.227
that we find to be interesting enough
to entertain us,

01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:16.272
but not so crazy
that it makes us uncomfortable.

01:11:22.236 --> 01:11:26.365
This is probably one
of my last opportunities as an artist

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:29.994
to grasp onto that kind of success.

01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:32.996
So...

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:36.709
I don't know, like,
as I'm reaching 30, I'm like...

01:11:37.042 --> 01:11:38.585
"I want to work really hard...

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:40.920
um...

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:46.427
while society is still tolerating me
being successful."

01:11:49.513 --> 01:11:52.391
We have another result
from the Senate. Marsha Blackburn...

01:11:52.474 --> 01:11:56.145
we were just talking about that...
Marsha Blackburn will win the Senate seat.

01:11:56.228 --> 01:12:00.607
The Bredesen camp was very much hoping
for the "Swift lift," as they called it,

01:12:00.691 --> 01:12:03.986
because young voter turnout spiked here
by sevenfold

01:12:04.069 --> 01:12:07.239
from the previous midterm election,
and yet that wasn't enough.

01:12:10.659 --> 01:12:13.787
I guess Tay Tay didn't have
that much sway-sway.

01:12:20.919 --> 01:12:22.671
I can't believe it. I can't believe it.

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:27.134
I can't believe that she gets to be
the first female senator in Tennessee

01:12:27.217 --> 01:12:29.094
and she's... she's Trump in a wig.

01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:32.181
She represents no female interests.

01:12:34.558 --> 01:12:37.853
She won by being a female applying

01:12:37.936 --> 01:12:40.981
to the kind of female
males want us to be

01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:44.485
in a horrendous... 1950s world.

01:12:45.986 --> 01:12:47.654
So, for the next two years,

01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:50.449
we have to build on what started here.

01:13:05.297 --> 01:13:08.050
The first verse I want to be all about,
like, hearing the news.

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:11.345
You know, if you were, like,
a kid who, like, loved Beto

01:13:11.428 --> 01:13:13.472
and thought that was the future
of Texas,

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:15.641
or you really thought Stacey Abrams
was gonna win

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:17.976
and you went door-to-door,
trying to make it happen,

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.300
and then she still gets beat...

01:13:19.353 --> 01:13:21.247
- It didn't happen.
- And it didn't happen.

01:13:21.271 --> 01:13:23.232
But it's like, statistically,

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:25.567
you know, we have, what?

01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:29.530
Three to four million people turning 18
in the next two years before the next one?

01:13:29.613 --> 01:13:30.489

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:33.492

I think we just need to,

01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:31.647
because we really do need people
to put the pressure on those senators

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:32.773
to pass the Equality Act.

01:17:32.856 --> 01:17:35.984
If they are forced to vote on it
and they do vote against it publicly,

01:17:36.068 --> 01:17:37.908

then we have their numbers,

01:17:37.944 --> 01:17:39.071

About a year.

01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:24.574

that I really like having cute nails,

01:18:24.658 --> 01:18:27.828

Taylor Swift, "You Need to Calm Down."

01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:11.455

half a million signatures, which...
