01:29.841 --> 01:32.961
Wow! Bob, take it easy!

01:33.052 --> 01:38.473
- Easy? Where does that get you?
- On dry land, I hope!

01:44.522 --> 01:47.274
It's doing 150 or better.

02:03.249 --> 02:06.452
He's coming in, believe it or not.

02:12.091 --> 02:14.167
Help Miss Daniels off.

02:18.890 --> 02:21.677
- I'm making another run.
- It's not safe out there!

02:21.768 --> 02:23.310
That's why you'll just watch.

02:23.394 --> 02:28.222
- It's starting to kick up, Mr Merrick.
- You keep this engine toned, that's all.

02:44.874 --> 02:47.448
What's wrong with him?
Hasn't he got any brains?

02:47.544 --> 02:50.544
He doesn't have to.
He's got four million bucks.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.568
He must be doing
better than 180 now.

03:24.873 --> 03:27.708
I knew that would happen!

03:27.792 --> 03:31.375
Miss Daniels, phone Emergency right
away! Come on, Joe, hurry up!

03:42.557 --> 03:47.100
- He's starting to breathe, Bill.
- I'll switch off the ventilator.

03:47.187 --> 03:50.306
- That was a close one.
- Bob Merrick just lives right.

03:52.317 --> 03:55.686
- Is that the ambulance?
- Yeah. Nothing more we can do here now.

03:55.778 --> 04:00.025
All right, everybody. There's nothing
to see. You can take off now.

04:00.116 --> 04:03.532
181. Come in, 181. 181, come in.

04:05.496 --> 04:06.528
Go ahead.

04:06.623 --> 04:11.166
Return the resuscitator to Dr Phillips'
home as soon as possible. Emergency.

04:11.252 --> 04:12.711
181. Understood.

04:12.795 --> 04:15.500
They want the resuscitator
right away, Bill.

04:15.590 --> 04:19.504
Leaving assignment now. Victim being
picked up by a hospital ambulance.

04:19.594 --> 04:22.215
- Return the resuscitator...
- Yes, I know.

04:22.305 --> 04:24.974
Returning the resuscitator
to Dr Phillips.

04:35.777 --> 04:40.688
- Did they say why they wanted it?
- Just to rush it back to Dr Phillips' house.

04:52.085 --> 04:54.327
Hurry. Dr Phillips. An accident.

04:54.879 --> 04:59.672
- What's the trouble, Miss Ashford?
- Take it inside to Dr Phillips, Bill.

04:59.759 --> 05:03.424
- Did you see Mrs Phillips' car anywhere?
- No, we didn't.

05:03.513 --> 05:06.051
Oh, I hope they get back in time.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.217
181 reporting.
We're at Dr Phillips'.

05:12.063 --> 05:16.974
Is it too chilly to eat on the terrace? We
could fix the tables with hurricane lamps.

05:17.068 --> 05:21.695
Helen, it's a lot of swank for practically
no reason. You bought out half the town.

05:21.781 --> 05:25.197
Isn't a wedding anniversary
enough reason to have a party?

05:25.285 --> 05:28.404
- Wait till you get married.
- But a six months anniversary?

05:28.496 --> 05:32.873
I've never been married six months before
and I want to tell the world that I love it.

05:32.959 --> 05:35.830
Shouldn't you have
given Dad some hint?

05:35.920 --> 05:39.503
I should say not! He'd have
nine reasons at the hospital

05:39.591 --> 05:41.667
why he couldn't come
home for dinner.

05:41.759 --> 05:45.128
Wayne can invent an emergency
operation at the drop of a hat

05:45.221 --> 05:48.306
if he knows he's to be the guest
of honour at a dinner party.

05:48.391 --> 05:50.680
Now what's the matter?

05:50.768 --> 05:53.556
I was just thinking of the
toast I'd give you two.

05:53.646 --> 05:58.771
To Wayne Phillips, a great surgeon,
a fine man and my wonderful father.

05:58.860 --> 06:01.565
And to you. Love and
affection to my mother.

06:01.654 --> 06:04.525
Mother? Oh, Joyce, you wouldn't.

06:04.616 --> 06:08.863
You married my father. You're certainly
the only mother I've ever known.

06:08.953 --> 06:11.195
And I'm all in favour
of the arrangement.

06:22.091 --> 06:24.167
I sure feel sorry for them.

06:28.890 --> 06:33.433
Oh, Joyce, it's so pleasant. We can have
dinner outside without any trouble at all.

06:33.520 --> 06:37.138
- Helen...
- Nancy, what are you doing over here?

06:37.232 --> 06:39.473
- Oh, Helen...
- What's the matter?

06:39.567 --> 06:41.061
- It's Wayne.
- What?

06:41.152 --> 06:43.394
He's had an accident.
Dr Dodge is with him.

06:43.488 --> 06:46.157
- Where is he?
- Here. Oh, Helen...

06:52.830 --> 06:55.072
Helen...

06:55.166 --> 06:59.034
- Wayne had an attack and...
- No.

06:59.128 --> 07:01.204
Dad!

07:04.759 --> 07:06.835
Those poor girls.

07:12.016 --> 07:15.432
He was such a wonderful man.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.726
He did so much for people.

07:20.275 --> 07:23.229
Why, Dr Dodge? Why?

07:23.319 --> 07:26.439
How many times I've been
asked that question.

07:26.531 --> 07:28.856
I've never learned the answer.

07:31.578 --> 07:34.151
Nancy, you go in with her.

07:41.880 --> 07:45.295
Joyce, I know there's
nothing I can say.

07:46.551 --> 07:48.959
What happened, Derwin?

07:49.053 --> 07:53.181
Nancy and I had come from the hospital
to go sailing with him this afternoon.

07:53.266 --> 07:56.967
He must have had the occlusion just
a few minutes before we got here.

07:57.061 --> 08:00.680
We saw him down at the
pier, all slumped over.

08:02.609 --> 08:06.737
- The resuscitator didn't help at all?
- No. It wasn't here.

08:06.821 --> 08:08.695
- It wasn't here?!
- No.

08:08.781 --> 08:13.740
But Dad's kept it here for years because
he had a coronary. You knew that.

08:13.828 --> 08:16.319
In heaven's name, where was it?

08:16.414 --> 08:19.450
Bob Merrick capsized his boat
at the other end of the lake.

08:19.542 --> 08:23.706
- The police came for it just before this...
- Bob Merrick!

08:25.465 --> 08:28.038
Oh, you don't know him. I do.

08:29.844 --> 08:33.296
He's a stupid, spoilt darn fool.

08:34.349 --> 08:39.770
And now, to think Bob Merrick is
alive because of Dad's resuscitator

08:39.854 --> 08:42.179
and Dad is dead...

08:42.273 --> 08:44.349
I could kill him!

08:52.408 --> 08:54.484
Helen...

08:59.874 --> 09:01.950
Helen...

09:04.546 --> 09:07.463
I loved him so much, Derwin.

09:07.549 --> 09:10.218
With all my heart.

09:10.301 --> 09:14.169
And we only had these few
short months together.

09:43.543 --> 09:48.584
I don't know how you're supposed to do it.
Just take the barge out and get her up.

09:48.673 --> 09:51.294
Don't bother me with
excuses. Get it done.

09:51.384 --> 09:54.136
When does Campbell
get in from Detroit?

09:54.220 --> 09:57.589
I don't want anybody else touching
those engines. Don't argue.

09:57.682 --> 10:02.261
- If I may take your temperature.
- Nonsense. I'm not even lukewarm.

10:02.353 --> 10:07.015
That's better. And have Jerry call me as
soon as he hears about the insurance.

10:07.108 --> 10:10.773
- Am I getting out of here today?
- The very instant you're able to leave

10:10.862 --> 10:13.151
we shall be happy to
sign your discharge.

10:13.239 --> 10:16.359
- But first...
- This is ridiculous. I'm perfectly healthy.

10:16.451 --> 10:20.947
A small respiratory infection, a slight
concussion, but no subdural clot.

10:21.039 --> 10:25.416
A subdural clot, Doctor, is a haematoma
anywhere in the cranial cavity.

10:25.502 --> 10:29.546
Thank you. I merely wondered where
you acquired that piece of information.

10:29.631 --> 10:32.585
Let me have a line. I was in med
school when my father died.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.335
I haven't wasted all my time.

10:34.427 --> 10:36.752
Why did you quit?
Too rough for a Merrick?

10:36.846 --> 10:39.468
I'll tell you why.
My father died at 42...

10:39.557 --> 10:41.301
Hello. Val?

10:41.392 --> 10:42.851
Who?

10:42.936 --> 10:44.394
No.

10:44.479 --> 10:48.773
Suddenly it seemed sensible to enjoy life
while I could. Let me have another line.

10:48.858 --> 10:52.227
My, how you've succeeded

10:55.907 --> 10:59.192
Hello, Val. How have
you been, baby?

11:00.703 --> 11:04.867
Don't go in, Nancy. You have to make a
formal request to take his temperature.

11:04.958 --> 11:07.662
When I think Dr Phillips died
so that he could live.

11:07.752 --> 11:10.124
Yes. What a complete waste.

11:11.130 --> 11:15.080
- Have you talked to Helen today?
- No. Not since yesterday.

11:15.176 --> 11:18.759
She's coming over this morning to
go through the doctor's things.

11:18.847 --> 11:22.262
You can count on it, baby.
It's a date. Goodbye.

11:25.353 --> 11:29.814
Would you do me a favour? Get Dr Phillips
down here to look at me so I can get out.

11:29.899 --> 11:33.315
- Here.
- Look, I haven't got a temperature.

11:33.403 --> 11:35.645
It's immaterial to me, Mr Merrick,

11:35.738 --> 11:40.696
but I'm going to take your
temperature one way or another.

11:40.785 --> 11:43.620
- A human being.
- Under the tongue, please.

11:43.705 --> 11:45.781
Where have you been all week?

11:45.874 --> 11:48.874
What kind of an establishment
is this? Will you tell me?

11:48.960 --> 11:52.661
I've been here five days and I'm
treated like a leper. No visitors.

11:52.755 --> 11:55.507
- It seemed advisable.
- My doctor doesn't even come.

11:55.592 --> 11:58.083
No, when Dr Albert
talked to Dr Dodge,

11:58.178 --> 12:02.222
he agreed the case didn't warrant his
coming up. He's very busy in New York.

12:02.307 --> 12:05.806
Then why don't I get Wayne Phillips?
It's his hospital, isn't it?

12:05.894 --> 12:08.266
It's obvious I get to pay his bill.

12:08.354 --> 12:13.396
- Don't look shocked. I'm used to it.
- I wasn't shocked, Mr Merrick.

12:13.484 --> 12:16.189
- I was only thinking.
- You were thinking what?

12:16.279 --> 12:20.442
I was thinking, when your father left
you the Merrick Motor Company millions,

12:20.533 --> 12:24.697
what a pity he couldn't also bequeath
you a little common courtesy.

12:24.787 --> 12:28.322
I don't know where you got those
pyjamas, or these cigarettes...

12:28.416 --> 12:31.370
your pharyngitis is bad
enough without them.

12:31.461 --> 12:36.039
In words of one syllable, Mr
Merrick, you talk too much.

12:36.132 --> 12:41.471
Now that's settled, how about getting Doc
Phillips to give me my separation papers?

12:41.554 --> 12:45.599
The reason the staff may have
seemed so distant, Mr Merrick,

12:45.683 --> 12:48.518
is that Dr Phillips
died a few days ago.

12:48.603 --> 12:53.598
It was rather sudden and he was
quite admired by all of us.

12:53.691 --> 12:58.400
- All you had to do was tell me.
- It hasn't been easy to talk about.

12:58.488 --> 13:02.023
When will I get out? I have too
many things to do that can't wait.

13:02.116 --> 13:05.034
I can't say. Perhaps in a few days.

13:08.915 --> 13:10.457
Wanna bet?

13:15.755 --> 13:18.044
Brightwood Hospital.

13:18.132 --> 13:22.925
- Miss Phillips, these came this morning.
- Oh, thanks.

13:24.138 --> 13:26.676
- Is Mrs Phillips in?
- Yes, she is.

13:27.892 --> 13:32.056
They're still coming. Amazing,
isn't it? Oh, I'm sorry.

13:32.146 --> 13:36.559
Yes, thank you. All right,
we'll see you. Goodbye.

13:37.110 --> 13:40.111
That was Tom. He's in the
village and coming over.

13:40.196 --> 13:42.652
He seemed a little more
urgent than he had to be.

13:42.740 --> 13:47.034
I suspect that lawyer of mine just
wanted to spend the afternoon with you.

13:47.120 --> 13:50.820
Dottore Vittorio Laradetti, Rome.

13:50.915 --> 13:55.376
I had no idea there were so many
people who respected Dad so much.

13:55.461 --> 13:58.961
And who felt so much in his debt.
From all over the country.

13:59.048 --> 14:01.124
From all over the world.

14:02.135 --> 14:03.843
Listen to this, Joyce.

14:03.928 --> 14:08.970
"Dear Mrs Dr Phillips, you don't know me,
but I owe everything to Dr Phillips."

14:09.058 --> 14:11.051
Yes, come in.

14:12.604 --> 14:15.770
Sorry, but there's another lady
here to see you. A Mrs Eden.

14:15.857 --> 14:17.933
She says she has to talk to you.

14:18.026 --> 14:22.070
- Want me to talk to her?
- No... Have her come in, Nancy.

14:22.155 --> 14:23.732
- Mrs Eden.
- Thank you.

14:23.823 --> 14:26.314
- Mrs Phillips, Mrs Eden.
- How do you do, my dear?

14:26.409 --> 14:29.493
- How do you do? Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

14:31.122 --> 14:34.538
We'll have to be very firm
about visitors, for her sake.

14:34.626 --> 14:38.789
Yesterday afternoon there were eight.
This morning it's beginning again.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.916
Apparently Dad had helped
them meet some crisis.

14:42.008 --> 14:45.424
- Money?
- No, not always. Sometimes just advice.

14:45.512 --> 14:50.173
But when you try to pin them down as
to how they became indebted to Dad,

14:50.266 --> 14:55.890
they stammer and dodge, as though they
belonged with him to some secret society.

14:55.980 --> 14:58.602
It's strange.

14:58.691 --> 15:03.152
Dr Phillips insisted
that it be kept secret.

15:03.238 --> 15:07.366
But now that he's dead, I suppose
I can talk about it, don't you?

15:07.450 --> 15:08.648
Certainly.

15:08.743 --> 15:13.868
It came to $4,000 all together,
and I want to pay you back.

15:13.957 --> 15:16.792
Why didn't you return
it to Dr Phillips?

15:16.876 --> 15:19.913
Oh, my dear, I tried so many
times, but he wouldn't take it.

15:20.004 --> 15:23.124
He'd become excited and say,
"You haven't told anyone?"

15:23.216 --> 15:25.588
I'd say, "Of course not.
You told us not to."

15:25.677 --> 15:31.347
Then he'd say, "That's right, Mrs Eden.
Any help I give you is just between us."

15:31.432 --> 15:36.260
- And he wouldn't let you repay it?
- He said he couldn't because...

15:36.354 --> 15:38.975
he'd already used it all up.

15:39.065 --> 15:42.730
And then he'd say to invest it.
"Invest in what?" I'd say.

15:42.819 --> 15:45.274
And he'd say, "Any poor devil."

15:45.363 --> 15:47.901
Wasn't that strange?

15:47.991 --> 15:52.154
Mrs Eden, what did he mean
when he said "used it all up"?

15:52.245 --> 15:55.365
I've tried to think so many times.

15:55.456 --> 15:58.208
Don't you know, Mrs Phillips?

15:58.293 --> 16:03.667
No. It's very odd. In four letters this
week, there's exactly the same expression.

16:03.756 --> 16:06.710
But it is a debt, and I
want to take care of it.

16:06.801 --> 16:09.375
You don't owe me
anything, Mrs Eden.

16:09.470 --> 16:13.136
If Dr Phillips couldn't accept
this, then neither can I.

16:13.224 --> 16:17.269
Well... if that's what you
want, Mrs Phillips, but...

16:17.353 --> 16:20.888
You keep it and use it...
for any poor devil.

16:20.982 --> 16:23.224
All right.

16:23.318 --> 16:27.102
He was a very remarkable
man, wasn't he?

16:27.197 --> 16:29.273
Yes, he was.

16:30.992 --> 16:35.321
Perhaps more remarkable
than any of us knew.

17:00.605 --> 17:04.768
- Hello, darling. How are you?
- Much better now that you're here.

17:04.858 --> 17:08.061
- How's Helen feeling?
- Oh, you know.

17:08.154 --> 17:12.900
- Oh, golly, Tom. I've missed you.
- I've missed you too.

17:23.752 --> 17:26.243
Hello, Tom. Thank you for
coming all this way.

17:26.339 --> 17:30.716
Helen. I wish I'd been able to come
up Sunday, but I've been swamped.

17:30.802 --> 17:34.550
I wanted to talk to both
of you about the estate.

17:34.639 --> 17:37.308
The estate? I hadn't
even thought of it.

17:37.392 --> 17:40.179
Neither had I. I should have
been a better attorney.

17:40.270 --> 17:45.644
I've made a complete survey
of Wayne's finances, and I...

17:45.733 --> 17:51.902
- I doubt you'll have any money at all.
- Not even insurance?

17:51.990 --> 17:56.237
Wayne had a $100,000 policy,
but he borrowed the maximum on it.

17:56.327 --> 18:00.455
- The rest might pay the taxes and debts.
- But what happened, Tom?

18:00.540 --> 18:03.457
But some of Dad's fees...
the Talleyrand operation...

18:03.543 --> 18:08.501
When Wayne removed the neoplasm from
the Talleyrand boy, he received $25,000.

18:08.590 --> 18:13.465
It was all withdrawn within seven weeks
in four cheques, all made out to "cash".

18:13.553 --> 18:18.131
The account's full of cash withdrawals.
Where did all this money go, Helen?

18:18.224 --> 18:21.593
Wayne didn't discuss money with me.
I really wouldn't know.

18:21.686 --> 18:24.936
That leaves you and Joyce with
the house and little else.

18:25.023 --> 18:28.273
And the hospital is liable to
be in very rocky shape too.

18:28.359 --> 18:30.732
Can't something be worked out, Tom?

18:30.820 --> 18:34.652
I want to go over his records and find
out what other assets he might have.

18:34.741 --> 18:37.232
Those you'll let me
collect for you, that is.

18:37.327 --> 18:40.826
And after that, well, we'll
see where you stand exactly.

18:40.914 --> 18:43.914
Well, thank you very much
for all your trouble.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.120
And you do as you feel best.

18:47.212 --> 18:49.288
- Will you excuse me?
- Certainly.

18:49.380 --> 18:54.007
I have to go to the house. The gardener's
confused about what bulbs to lift this fall.

18:54.093 --> 18:57.047
I promised I'd do it.
It can't wait any longer.

18:57.138 --> 18:59.890
I'll see you both at the house.

19:20.161 --> 19:25.072
- Can I help?
- I suspect you could help... tremendously.

19:25.583 --> 19:27.659
Are you all right?

19:28.711 --> 19:31.285
Adequate as can be.

19:31.381 --> 19:34.417
- Going to the village?
- Yes. Can I give you a lift?

19:34.509 --> 19:36.133
You certainly can.

19:36.219 --> 19:38.710
I'll make it. I'll make it.

19:42.141 --> 19:48.394
- What seems to be the trouble?
- Long story. You wouldn't be interested.

19:53.111 --> 19:55.518
You live around here?

19:55.613 --> 19:56.942
Yes.

19:57.031 --> 20:00.116
I should have collapsed on
one of these roads long ago.

20:01.327 --> 20:03.865
- I meant it in the nicest way.
- I'm sure you did.

20:03.955 --> 20:07.953
- You don't sound like it.
- I'm sorry, but I have a lot on my mind.

20:08.042 --> 20:10.118
That's all right. So do I.

20:10.211 --> 20:13.545
Can't we talk about it better
after I take you to lunch?

20:13.631 --> 20:15.707
I think not.

20:17.719 --> 20:24.172
Before you decide I'm just a character
who stumbled out of the woods, Miss P...

20:24.267 --> 20:27.517
Monogram on your purse.
20/20. Always keep 'em open.

20:27.604 --> 20:30.605
My name is Phillips...
Mrs Wayne Phillips.

20:32.650 --> 20:34.726
Oh.

20:34.819 --> 20:37.441
I'm sorry, Mrs Phillips.

20:37.530 --> 20:41.362
You know, I just heard
about your husband.

20:41.451 --> 20:45.947
I'm really sorry. He must have
been a really great person.

20:46.039 --> 20:48.708
It's a rough way to go.

20:48.791 --> 20:51.365
Maybe they'll get another
resuscitator now.

20:51.461 --> 20:54.331
Resuscitator? Did they
try to use one on him?

20:54.422 --> 20:57.873
We'd have had his at the house, but
there was an accident on the lake

20:57.967 --> 21:00.375
and the police took it there.

21:00.470 --> 21:02.676
You mean...

21:02.764 --> 21:05.302
the accident Bob Merrick had?

21:06.017 --> 21:08.722
Yes. Bob Merrick.

21:11.898 --> 21:14.270
So...

21:14.359 --> 21:17.977
Bob Merrick is alive,

21:18.071 --> 21:20.941
and only because your husband...

21:23.159 --> 21:26.196
Let me out up here, will you?

21:28.915 --> 21:32.450
- Thanks.
- Are you sure you're all right?

21:54.607 --> 21:57.810
He can't have just disappeared.
Miss O'Malley, flash Dr Dodge.

21:57.902 --> 22:00.227
All right, thanks.

22:00.321 --> 22:01.863
There's work to do.

22:01.948 --> 22:06.242
Have Dr Dodge report to the
front desk immediately.

22:08.997 --> 22:12.531
- Helen. What's the matter?
- I just gave a man a ride on the lake road.

22:12.625 --> 22:14.951
He's in shock or exhausted.
He's in the car.

22:15.044 --> 22:17.120
Frank, get a stretcher.

22:22.177 --> 22:24.253
It's Bob Merrick.

22:25.096 --> 22:27.172
Who?

22:30.101 --> 22:33.850
Come on. I want you to rest
a little while, Helen.

22:33.938 --> 22:38.018
It's... It just came
before I was ready for it.

22:38.109 --> 22:40.185
I know, darling.

22:41.362 --> 22:45.194
- I'm all right, Nancy.
- Don't talk about it.

22:47.285 --> 22:50.072
Come in and lie down
a little while.

22:52.123 --> 22:56.251
I don't know, Nancy.
Maybe it's just as well.

22:58.129 --> 23:00.916
I'll never have to see him again.

23:10.099 --> 23:11.677
Brightwood Hospital.

23:11.768 --> 23:15.468
Mrs Phillips?
I'm sorry, I can't ring her.

23:15.563 --> 23:16.761
Yes, Mr Merrick?

23:16.856 --> 23:18.730
- Is my bill ready?
- Yes, sir.

23:18.816 --> 23:23.028
Mrs Phillips is in Dr Phillips' office
and she's asked me to hold her calls.

23:23.112 --> 23:26.944
Thank you. I will give Mrs
Phillips your message.

23:28.284 --> 23:30.360
Your bill, Mr Merrick.

23:44.300 --> 23:49.046
You've answered so many questions that
have been puzzling me, Mr Randolph.

23:49.138 --> 23:53.385
Several people in the last few days
have mentioned Wayne's way of life.

23:53.476 --> 23:58.601
And when they talk about "using it all up",
I had no idea what they meant.

23:58.690 --> 24:01.062
I'm so happy that
you could tell me.

24:02.110 --> 24:04.517
You don't talk much
about this belief.

24:04.612 --> 24:06.984
When someone's ready for
it, they accept it.

24:07.073 --> 24:12.447
Perhaps Wayne felt you weren't ready...
or that you were pretty perfect without it.

24:12.537 --> 24:14.411
Well, I must be going.

24:14.497 --> 24:18.329
Wayne mentioned so many times how
anxious he was for me to meet you.

24:18.418 --> 24:20.743
I'm sorry it was under
these circumstances.

24:20.837 --> 24:25.380
I flew up from Mexico as soon as I heard.
I thought possibly I might be able to...

24:25.466 --> 24:28.337
Make it a little easier for me?
Well, you have.

24:28.428 --> 24:29.708
Thank you.

24:29.804 --> 24:33.754
- We'll be seeing you very soon, I hope.
- Yes. I'll be back in my studio now.

24:37.020 --> 24:39.262
Mrs Phillips,
I want to talk to you.

24:39.355 --> 24:41.929
- I'm very busy.
- Oh, I was just leaving.

24:42.025 --> 24:44.895
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, and thank you.

24:51.951 --> 24:54.240
You and I don't have
anything to talk about.

24:54.329 --> 24:57.164
- I know how you feel about me.
- Please leave me alone.

24:57.248 --> 24:59.324
Your husband was an
eminent surgeon.

24:59.417 --> 25:04.542
Everybody's saying that a character like me
is still around while your husband is...

25:04.631 --> 25:06.707
Here.

25:09.052 --> 25:13.002
- And what is that supposed to do?
- Supposed to do?

25:13.097 --> 25:15.173
Most people'd be
very glad to get it.

25:15.266 --> 25:17.971
Will paying thousands help
you forget it happened?

25:18.061 --> 25:22.390
It's all very simple to you... a cheque
can take care of anything, any time.

25:22.482 --> 25:25.317
Most people would be very
happy to receive $25,000.

25:25.401 --> 25:28.355
Was it my fault? I didn't ask
you for your resuscitator.

25:28.446 --> 25:30.818
Smash up somebody's car,
write out a cheque.

25:30.907 --> 25:33.362
Get in a mess with a showgirl,
write out a cheque.

25:33.451 --> 25:37.401
And when a man dies, write out a cheque
to his widow... account paid in full.

25:37.497 --> 25:39.988
- Listen...
- Leave me alone!

25:50.927 --> 25:55.174
When you go to Mexico City,
you must hear Rosario.

25:55.265 --> 25:59.476
His voice is just divine.
It does things for me.

25:59.561 --> 26:03.095
Good for you. But he doesn't
sound like my type.

26:03.189 --> 26:04.220
Pardon me.

26:04.315 --> 26:07.649
It's one of the most beautiful
things I've ever seen.

26:07.735 --> 26:10.820
- The owner must have spent a fortune.
- Good for him.

26:10.905 --> 26:15.199
It's got all kinds of gadgets.
It's got... red-spoke wheels...

26:18.371 --> 26:22.072
What did they do to
you in that joint?

26:22.166 --> 26:26.116
I know your big trouble, honey.
You need Val to take care of you.

26:26.212 --> 26:29.166
The principal
difficulty seems to be,

26:29.257 --> 26:35.046
the anaesthetics you get in these bars are
never as effective as the customer hopes.

26:35.138 --> 26:38.258
- What, honey?
- Good night, baby.

26:42.896 --> 26:46.311
- How about a drink, Val?
- No, thank you.

26:49.861 --> 26:54.606
- Don't you want to take me home?
- That's an interesting idea.

26:54.699 --> 26:57.819
I'll call you.
So long and farewell.

28:29.335 --> 28:33.499
- Yes?
- I'm sorry to bother you this time of night.

28:33.590 --> 28:36.294
I just clobbered my car
in the ditch. Look.

28:36.384 --> 28:39.053
That's all right. Come in.

28:39.137 --> 28:42.387
Thank you for your hospitality.

28:42.473 --> 28:46.720
It's a nice place you have here.
A very nice place indeed.

28:46.811 --> 28:50.145
- Are you all right?
- Me? Of course.

28:50.231 --> 28:54.063
It takes more than pranging up a car
to incapacitate old Bob Merrick,

28:54.152 --> 28:55.895
pride of the Merrick clan.

28:55.987 --> 28:57.861
You're Bob Merrick, eh?

28:57.947 --> 29:00.355
- Who are you?
- Edward Randolph.

29:00.450 --> 29:04.494
- How do you... Who?
- It's all right. I live here.

29:04.579 --> 29:11.293
Edward... may I please bother you...
for a telephone, please?

29:11.377 --> 29:12.955
- Of course.
- Wait a minute.

29:13.046 --> 29:15.963
Gotta call somebody to
come and pick me up.

29:16.049 --> 29:19.667
- Must tell 'em to wear their safety belts.
- Right back here.

29:19.761 --> 29:22.252
- Where?
- Right back here.

29:22.347 --> 29:24.423
Oh.

29:27.602 --> 29:29.678
Go slow.

29:35.485 --> 29:36.944
Hello?

29:37.028 --> 29:38.606
Hello there.

29:38.696 --> 29:42.315
- Ed, did you do these pictures?
- Yes.

29:42.408 --> 29:43.440
Nice.

29:43.535 --> 29:46.108
As far as I'm concerned,
Art is just a guy's name.

29:46.204 --> 29:48.280
- Williams?
- Shouldn't you dial?

29:48.373 --> 29:50.033
Shh! Williams.

29:50.124 --> 29:52.829
This is Robert Merrick Esquire.

29:52.919 --> 29:57.913
I had a little trouble with my car. Would
you come over and pick me up, please?

29:58.007 --> 29:59.881
Williams?

29:59.968 --> 30:03.668
Don't snore, old man. Wake up.

30:03.763 --> 30:07.262
Hardest thing these days,
getting good help.

30:07.350 --> 30:10.553
Very nice job.

30:10.645 --> 30:16.066
Where have we met? Don't tell
me, don't tell me. I met you...

30:17.902 --> 30:21.900
- Is that?
- It's a portrait I did of Wayne Phillips.

30:21.990 --> 30:24.066
Phillips.

30:24.909 --> 30:26.985
Phillips.

30:28.663 --> 30:31.580
He's the man who's haunting me.

30:33.751 --> 30:35.709
You know what?

30:35.795 --> 30:40.007
I almost drowned, but a resuscitator
saved me. Whose is it? Dr Phillips'.

30:40.091 --> 30:44.219
They shoot me to a hospital to make old
Merrick good for another 20,000 miles.

30:44.304 --> 30:46.759
Whose hospital? Dr Phillips'.

30:46.848 --> 30:50.264
Then I meet her. A girl.
A girl who is...

30:50.351 --> 30:52.593
a very beautiful girl.

30:52.687 --> 30:56.305
Whose wife is she? One guess, pal.

30:56.399 --> 30:59.566
- Now look here, Merrick...
- Tell me where we've met.

30:59.652 --> 31:02.487
In the hospital.
In Dr Phillips' office.

31:02.572 --> 31:04.648
Dr Phillips.

31:05.950 --> 31:08.026
You see?

31:08.786 --> 31:11.242
He is haunting me.

32:01.923 --> 32:06.134
- I'm glad you made it.
- I'm not sure I have.

32:06.219 --> 32:08.295
Try this anyway.

32:12.517 --> 32:15.720
Do you mind telling
me what happened?

32:17.021 --> 32:20.141
Oh... I wrecked the
car, in a ditch.

32:20.233 --> 32:24.859
Yes. The right front wheel. I called your
house and asked someone to come over.

32:24.946 --> 32:27.567
- I hope you don't mind.
- Not at all.

32:27.657 --> 32:30.230
- Think a shower'd help?
- I certainly do.

32:30.326 --> 32:33.446
Make it a cold one. Up those
stairs and to the right.

32:33.538 --> 32:35.614
Thanks a lot.

32:44.299 --> 32:46.872
I hope I wasn't too much
trouble last night.

32:46.968 --> 32:49.637
When I pass out, I usually
like to be in my own bed.

32:49.721 --> 32:51.345
No trouble.

32:51.431 --> 32:56.223
Oh, I know where I saw you.
With Helen Phillips.

32:56.311 --> 33:00.143
That's right, Merrick.
Will you take these?

33:04.611 --> 33:08.062
- Have you known her long?
- No.

33:08.156 --> 33:12.070
But Wayne Phillips was
the best friend I had.

33:12.160 --> 33:13.903
Coffee's ready.

33:13.995 --> 33:16.486
Yes, the portrait you did of him.

33:16.581 --> 33:19.333
It's really good.
You're quite a painter.

33:19.417 --> 33:21.623
Well, maybe I am now.

33:21.711 --> 33:25.839
If so, I have Phillips to thank. He's
the one who unlocked everything.

33:25.924 --> 33:28.331
- Phillips did?
- Yes. I met him some years ago

33:28.426 --> 33:32.376
when I was still trying to find my
way in painting, getting nowhere.

33:32.472 --> 33:36.801
I spent my life making fairly
adequate copies of the masters.

33:36.893 --> 33:39.562
I always wanted to
create like they did.

33:39.646 --> 33:41.934
But I just never could.

33:42.023 --> 33:44.644
Until Phillips showed me
how to get what I wanted.

33:44.734 --> 33:47.605
How did he do that?
How could a surgeon help?

33:47.695 --> 33:49.771
Well, he taught me...

33:50.907 --> 33:54.857
He showed me how to establish contact
with a source of infinite power.

33:54.953 --> 33:57.989
That sounds fine.
What does it mean?

33:58.081 --> 34:00.453
Well, let me put it this way.

34:01.459 --> 34:03.535
This lamp isn't working now.

34:03.628 --> 34:08.585
It's cold, and it's dark. All the parts
are there, it's a perfect light, but...

34:08.675 --> 34:10.583
- It's just not turned on.
- Right.

34:10.677 --> 34:14.840
But if I turn the switch
and establish contact,

34:14.931 --> 34:17.552
the bulb will draw power
from the powerhouse

34:17.641 --> 34:20.678
and it'll do what it was meant
to do, which is to make light.

34:20.770 --> 34:24.139
So you're saying that people
have a sort of powerhouse too.

34:24.232 --> 34:27.766
Establish contact with that and you
can do what you're meant to do.

34:27.860 --> 34:32.772
- You can fulfil your destiny.
- I can turn on a light.

34:32.866 --> 34:35.902
I don't think that's your destiny.

34:35.994 --> 34:39.362
- Do you?
- No, I guess not.

34:39.455 --> 34:44.793
Assuming there is a power of some kind,
how do you establish contact with it?

34:44.878 --> 34:49.005
It's very simple: Just be
of real service to people.

34:49.090 --> 34:51.498
Find people who need
help, and help them.

34:51.592 --> 34:54.344
But always in secret.
Never let it be known.

34:54.429 --> 34:56.587
And never ask to be repaid.

34:56.681 --> 34:59.137
But why does it have
to be kept secret?

34:59.225 --> 35:03.934
That's probably the most
important part of this belief.

35:04.022 --> 35:06.347
Let's go back to the powerhouse.

35:06.441 --> 35:10.818
If the wires in the dynamo are
not protected by insulation,

35:10.904 --> 35:13.940
the power will be dissipated.
The same goes for us.

35:14.032 --> 35:18.029
Most personalities are just grounded.
That's all that ails them.

35:18.119 --> 35:21.037
I see. You mean keeping
these good deeds secret

35:21.122 --> 35:23.827
is like insulating the
power of your personality.

35:23.917 --> 35:29.871
- Yeah, that's near enough.
- If it works, fine. Obviously it helped you.

35:29.964 --> 35:32.634
Isn't there anything in
the world that you need

35:32.717 --> 35:35.504
that you haven't been able
to get in the ordinary way?

35:35.595 --> 35:37.671
Not a thing.

35:39.307 --> 35:41.465
Except...

35:41.559 --> 35:44.513
I'd like to square myself
with Helen Phillips.

35:44.604 --> 35:45.517
Oh?

35:45.605 --> 35:51.690
But if I just help out some poor joker, why
does it follow that she'll listen to me?

35:51.778 --> 35:55.194
I think you might be
surprised at what follows

35:55.281 --> 35:57.855
after trying this way of life.

35:59.953 --> 36:06.205
Well, if it's as simple as all that,
why, I'll certainly give it a chance.

36:07.168 --> 36:08.579
Wait, Merrick.

36:08.670 --> 36:13.047
Don't try this unless you're ready. You
can't just try it for a week like a new car.

36:13.132 --> 36:17.296
And if you think you can feather your
own nest with it, just forget it.

36:17.387 --> 36:20.590
Besides, this is dangerous stuff.

36:22.267 --> 36:24.555
One of the first men who used it

36:24.644 --> 36:28.476
went to the cross at the age of 33.

36:32.861 --> 36:34.937
Excuse me.

36:38.575 --> 36:41.860
- Won't you come in, please?
- I understand that Mr Merrick...

36:41.953 --> 36:45.618
- I'm here, Williams.
- Good morning, Mr Merrick.

36:46.624 --> 36:52.045
Well, goodbye. And thanks. You take
good care of a drunk and his hangover.

36:52.130 --> 36:55.795
I ought to know how by this time.
I've been there myself.

37:21.075 --> 37:24.076
Mr Merrick! It's good to
see you around again.

37:24.162 --> 37:25.989
Hello, Dan.

37:26.080 --> 37:28.156
No. Another look you owe me.

37:28.249 --> 37:31.914
- How's the family?
- Not so hot. We lost the baby, you know.

37:32.003 --> 37:34.708
- Oh?
- The missus is still in the hospital.

37:34.797 --> 37:39.625
- The bills are pretty rough.
- I'm sorry to hear it, Dan.

37:50.522 --> 37:53.606
- Say, Dan.
- Yes, Mr Merrick?

37:53.691 --> 37:56.396
How much do you need
for all the expenses?

37:56.486 --> 37:58.977
About $300 would do it.

38:00.532 --> 38:03.651
- Mr Merrick...
- It's yours. On two conditions.

38:03.743 --> 38:05.819
- Anything.
- Don't tell anybody.

38:05.912 --> 38:08.699
- I've got to tell my wife.
- No, not even your wife.

38:08.790 --> 38:11.791
And never try to pay it back.
I don't want it.

38:11.876 --> 38:13.536
- Anything you say.
- Good.

38:13.628 --> 38:16.997
But this is sure a funny way
to help a guy out, isn't it?

38:17.090 --> 38:20.007
I think you're absolutely right.

38:24.097 --> 38:28.047
- I don't believe it!
- Your order, Mr Merrick?

38:29.227 --> 38:30.472
It does work.

38:30.562 --> 38:34.939
Thank you, Phyllis. Joyce and I will see
you again soon. We won't hibernate.

38:35.024 --> 38:37.562
- I'm glad of that.
- Goodbye.

38:38.862 --> 38:42.906
Mrs Phillips. This is more than just a
coincidence. I've got to talk to you.

38:42.991 --> 38:46.525
- I was just leaving.
- You have two minutes, haven't you?

38:46.619 --> 38:51.412
Perhaps I wasn't as diplomatic as I could
have been, but I did mean well, really.

38:51.499 --> 38:55.331
We've all been under a strain. Sorry
if I said anything I shouldn't have.

38:55.420 --> 39:00.627
What I can't understand is how we've
avoided knowing each other before this.

39:00.717 --> 39:02.709
It wasn't intentional,
I assure you.

39:02.802 --> 39:05.922
I think we ought to correct
that mistake. Don't you?

39:06.014 --> 39:08.172
Of course. I'm very late.

39:08.933 --> 39:11.009
Mrs Phillips.

39:11.102 --> 39:14.553
We haven't decided where we're
going to have dinner tonight.

39:14.647 --> 39:18.182
I have a previous engagement.
Excuse me.

39:19.694 --> 39:22.232
Please don't go!

39:22.322 --> 39:25.192
I'd like to ask you... about
this theory of Dr Phillips'

39:25.283 --> 39:27.739
that Edward Randolph
was telling me about.

39:27.827 --> 39:31.492
- Why would he talk to you about it?
- I guess he believes in it.

39:31.581 --> 39:34.154
I guess I'm starting to,
after meeting you here.

39:34.250 --> 39:36.243
What has meeting me
got to do with it?

39:36.336 --> 39:39.206
Well, I... I just did something.

39:40.340 --> 39:43.958
I'm going to go find somebody that
needs a couple of thousand bucks

39:44.052 --> 39:45.843
and my worries will be over.

39:45.929 --> 39:51.054
I think you've twisted my husband's
beliefs into something very cheap.

39:51.142 --> 39:53.218
Taxi!

39:53.978 --> 39:56.054
Wait a minute!

39:57.482 --> 40:01.065
- 15 Lake Drive, please.
- Mrs Phillips.

40:03.363 --> 40:06.280
- I wouldn't offend you for the world.
- Just drive on.

40:06.366 --> 40:09.699
- Wait here. Mrs Phillips...
- Please don't start a scene.

40:09.786 --> 40:12.573
I'm only trying to tell you that...

40:13.748 --> 40:15.207
Look out!

40:31.474 --> 40:33.348
Brightwood Hospital.

40:33.434 --> 40:36.139
The line is busy. Will you hold?

40:36.896 --> 40:40.514
I'll try to locate him for you.

40:40.650 --> 40:42.726
Brightwood Hospital.

40:42.819 --> 40:44.895
I'll take a message.

40:47.490 --> 40:49.530
I can connect you now.

40:51.119 --> 40:52.862
Brightwood Hospital.

40:57.292 --> 41:00.079
- Is there any chance at all?
- No.

41:01.129 --> 41:03.999
How about the x-ray findings?

41:04.090 --> 41:07.957
They leave no hope.
She's lucky to be alive.

41:08.052 --> 41:10.341
Will you tell them, Nancy?

41:11.639 --> 41:13.299
- All right.
- Thank you.

41:16.853 --> 41:18.929
Miss Ashford...

41:19.898 --> 41:21.974
Joyce.

41:22.066 --> 41:24.392
She's going to live.

41:25.695 --> 41:27.652
And she'll be all right in time?

41:27.739 --> 41:30.656
Not completely. There's
an inoperable lesion.

41:30.742 --> 41:33.149
- What is it?
- Where?

41:33.244 --> 41:35.118
Well... Her eyes.

41:35.205 --> 41:37.778
Tell me, Nancy.
Let me have it straight.

41:37.874 --> 41:39.534
She'll be blind.

41:39.626 --> 41:42.295
- Blind?
- It can't be.

41:43.630 --> 41:46.915
Oh, no!

41:47.008 --> 41:51.800
- Miss Ashford, could I see her?
- Haven't you done enough?!

41:51.888 --> 41:55.506
- Joyce...
- It's the truth. Why shouldn't I say it?

41:55.600 --> 42:02.053
She'll never see again, thanks to you.
Write a cheque for that, Mr Merrick!

42:24.462 --> 42:27.167
No, Nancy. No.

42:27.257 --> 42:30.507
Darling, don't you think if
you just talk to him once...

42:30.593 --> 42:35.054
What good would it do?
What could he possibly say?

42:35.139 --> 42:38.093
And what difference
would it make now?

42:40.895 --> 42:44.098
I don't blame him for
anything, Nancy.

42:44.190 --> 42:48.270
It's just that I feel it's better
if I don't see him at all.

42:48.361 --> 42:51.860
Well... I'll send him away.

43:03.918 --> 43:05.994
I'm sorry, Mr Merrick.

43:07.297 --> 43:09.373
She won't see you.

43:27.609 --> 43:29.352
Nancy?

43:29.444 --> 43:31.602
Yes, darling.

43:31.696 --> 43:34.483
I know I'm right.

43:34.574 --> 43:36.780
He'll finally give up.

44:00.391 --> 44:03.428
- Your things are on the beach, Helen.
- Thank you, Nancy.

44:03.520 --> 44:05.845
- Is Judy there?
- Yes. She's waiting for us.

44:05.939 --> 44:08.726
- Call me when you're ready to go down.
- I will.

44:08.816 --> 44:11.105
- Some more tea, Helen?
- Yes, thank you.

44:11.194 --> 44:12.937
- Is Nancy staying with you?
- No.

44:13.029 --> 44:16.113
She comes and takes me down
to the beach, picks me up later,

44:16.199 --> 44:18.868
whenever she can get
away from the hospital.

44:18.952 --> 44:22.949
- I'm going to miss you terribly, Ed.
- Well, I hate to say goodbye.

44:23.039 --> 44:25.328
But I've refused the
gallery so many times,

44:25.416 --> 44:28.287
and I do have to be in Chicago
at least once this year.

44:28.378 --> 44:33.040
You've been wonderful all these months,
and I apologise for being a handful.

44:33.132 --> 44:35.006
Uh-uh, Helen. Quiet.

44:35.093 --> 44:38.793
Well, I'd have thrown me in the
drink if I were me. Thank you.

44:39.681 --> 44:44.390
But, Ed, I get so tired of
learning how to eat and dressing

44:44.477 --> 44:46.802
and finding out where
the heck things are.

44:46.896 --> 44:51.357
I get so tense, and then I'm
a problem to everybody.

44:51.442 --> 44:54.479
Of course you have to have
people around to help you.

44:54.571 --> 44:57.240
So do several geniuses
that I could mention.

44:57.323 --> 44:59.695
But you're such a good friend.

44:59.784 --> 45:02.405
- And don't forget that.
- No.

45:02.495 --> 45:05.282
Sorry I had to miss Joyce.
Say goodbye for me.

45:05.373 --> 45:08.908
Yes, I will. She's in town. It's
about that accident insurance.

45:09.002 --> 45:11.374
Thank goodness for that.
It's kept us going.

45:11.462 --> 45:14.167
Well, goodbye.
You'll be hearing from me.

45:14.257 --> 45:15.917
God bless you.

45:16.009 --> 45:18.167
- I'll get Nancy.
- No, not yet.

45:18.261 --> 45:20.669
Where's my radar?

45:21.598 --> 45:26.260
No, no, no. As a farewell present for
you, I'm going to try something.

45:28.271 --> 45:32.103
For the first time, in your honour,
down to the cove all by myself.

45:32.192 --> 45:36.141
- But you've never gone down there alone.
- Well, it's about time I start.

45:36.237 --> 45:39.902
- I'd better go partway with you.
- Oh, no. Just stay and watch.

45:39.991 --> 45:42.743
I know these steps by heart.

45:42.827 --> 45:45.152
One...

45:45.246 --> 45:47.702
two...

45:47.790 --> 45:48.822
three...

45:49.417 --> 45:51.493
Helen?

45:52.545 --> 45:54.621
Where did Helen go?

46:01.346 --> 46:04.465
- That's progress for you.
- It's remarkable!

46:09.854 --> 46:11.847
Judy!

46:11.940 --> 46:14.016
Hi, Helen!

46:17.028 --> 46:18.985
Say, what do you know!

46:19.072 --> 46:22.405
- You started exploring by yourself!
- How about that!

46:22.492 --> 46:26.324
- I'm sorry I'm late, Judy.
- Me too. I gotta get back early.

46:26.412 --> 46:30.244
I thought you weren't coming, so I
went ahead and read the whole chapter.

46:30.333 --> 46:33.251
Serves me right for being late.
What happened?

46:33.336 --> 46:37.464
Well, old Huckleberry's on
this crazy raft with Jim,

46:37.549 --> 46:40.503
and they run into this
old, deserted houseboat.

46:40.593 --> 46:43.511
- Huck... Here's a step.
- Oh. Thank you.

46:43.596 --> 46:46.266
One, two, three, four, five steps.

46:46.349 --> 46:49.350
Now let's see.
Where was I? Oh, yes.

46:49.435 --> 46:52.009
Huck thinks maybe they
can scrounge something,

46:52.105 --> 46:56.399
so he starts to investigate in
all this dirt and disorder.

46:56.484 --> 47:01.645
He opens this door and finds two fellas
talking in a very rough fashion.

47:01.739 --> 47:05.405
Well, here we are.
Take it easy, now.

47:06.953 --> 47:09.989
These characters are
very hostile indeed.

47:10.081 --> 47:11.492
And?

47:11.583 --> 47:15.082
Tune in tomorrow,
same time, same station.

47:15.170 --> 47:16.961
Shall do.

47:17.046 --> 47:19.169
What's going on out
on the lake, Judy?

47:19.257 --> 47:21.962
Oh, I'd say there's
about a ten-knot blow,

47:22.051 --> 47:25.551
and about a half-dozen
snipes having a race.

47:25.638 --> 47:29.303
And a couple of stars foolin'
around by the yacht club.

47:29.392 --> 47:33.472
And a real gone daddy zoomin'
around with his inboard.

47:33.563 --> 47:38.355
Aw, some babe's water-skiing.
Not so hot. She's usin' both hands.

47:38.443 --> 47:41.563
- Sounds like a big day.
- Yeah!

47:41.654 --> 47:44.988
Hate to rush, Helen, but OK
if I do the newspaper now?

47:45.074 --> 47:46.948
Sure. But what's the hurry?

47:47.035 --> 47:50.569
Mother stuck me with Susan
Shacker's birthday party.

47:50.663 --> 47:53.700
Can you imagine me in a dress?

47:53.791 --> 47:57.575
Well... In Europe,
things aren't so hot.

47:57.670 --> 48:00.624
In the Pacific,
things aren't so hot.

48:00.715 --> 48:02.340
And in Washington...

48:02.425 --> 48:06.589
If you want to know my opinion,
things are pretty fouled up all over.

48:08.348 --> 48:13.175
Page 3. Here's a girdle and bra ad... which
I won't be needing for quite a while.

48:14.062 --> 48:18.059
I'm a dog to run off, I know. But what
can you do with parents, eh, Helen?

48:18.149 --> 48:20.854
Nothing, I guess. But we'll
be together tomorrow.

48:20.944 --> 48:22.829
Sure. Want me to
take you back up?

48:22.855 --> 48:25.547
No, I think I'll sit here for
a while. I'm all right.

48:25.615 --> 48:28.320
OK. You're a big girl now.

48:28.409 --> 48:30.034
- See you!
- Bye.

48:39.003 --> 48:41.043
Hey, handsome!

48:41.130 --> 48:42.838
Yeah, you, Tarzan!

48:42.924 --> 48:47.004
I'm stuck! Wanna help
me launch my boat?

48:51.558 --> 48:57.810
A girl's in real tough shape when she's
got no figure and no muscles either.

49:01.192 --> 49:05.107
Thanks! Stick around!
I think we can use you!

49:05.196 --> 49:07.070
Bye, Helen!

49:07.156 --> 49:08.236
Goodbye!

49:16.624 --> 49:18.700
Thank you for your help.

49:19.752 --> 49:20.997
Sure.

49:21.087 --> 49:25.132
I didn't know anyone else was here.
Do you come to the cove often?

49:25.884 --> 49:29.087
Well... lately a little.

49:29.179 --> 49:32.797
I've noticed you and
Judy a few times.

49:33.808 --> 49:36.382
Well, I'm Mrs Phillips.

49:38.396 --> 49:41.397
And I hope any friend of
Judy's is a friend of mine.

49:41.482 --> 49:43.274
How do you do, Mrs Phillips?

49:43.359 --> 49:47.606
- And you're?
- Rob... My name's Robinson.

49:48.448 --> 49:52.825
Well, you know, it's a bit
chillier than I thought.

49:52.911 --> 49:56.860
Oh, dear. I'm sorry, but would you
help me find my shawl? I don't see.

49:56.956 --> 49:58.700
Of course.

49:58.791 --> 50:02.872
I'm very awkward, I guess, but
Judy's a wonderful builder-upper.

50:02.962 --> 50:06.877
I don't think anybody could come
through any better than you have.

50:06.966 --> 50:12.387
- With a subdural haematoma like yours...
- That's where I met you. At the hospital.

50:12.472 --> 50:16.635
- You're a doctor.
- No. We've never met.

50:18.186 --> 50:22.764
I know a little about medicine.
I studied to be a surgeon once.

50:22.857 --> 50:27.852
- But I have heard your voice, haven't I?
- I don't think so, Mrs Phillips.

50:29.614 --> 50:35.237
- Is there anything else I can do?
- No, thank you. I'm very comfortable.

50:35.328 --> 50:38.448
Mrs Phillips, I wonder...

50:39.874 --> 50:43.706
Would it be all right if
I came by occasionally?

50:43.795 --> 50:47.045
Just for launching outboards
and general morale purposes?

50:47.131 --> 50:49.420
- I hope I'm not imposing.
- Of course not.

50:49.509 --> 50:51.632
We'll hope to see you
again very soon.

50:51.719 --> 50:53.795
Yes. Soon.

50:54.639 --> 50:56.715
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

51:23.751 --> 51:27.085
I hope that I've been able
to make myself clear.

51:27.172 --> 51:30.837
What you say you want to do is the
best news that anyone could tell me.

51:30.925 --> 51:34.425
But I warn you, the investment
of one's life in others

51:34.512 --> 51:38.889
and the alignment of oneself with
the forces that lead up and on,

51:38.975 --> 51:41.846
- this does not come cheap.
- I don't expect it to be.

51:41.936 --> 51:46.598
Once you go into it, you're bound.
You'll never be able to give it up.

51:46.691 --> 51:52.030
You'll find this furnishes your
motive power. It will obsess you.

51:52.113 --> 51:56.905
But, believe me, it'll be
a magnificent obsession.

52:18.389 --> 52:21.390
- Thank you, Williams.
- A Mr Masterson is here.

52:21.476 --> 52:24.311
- Any mail?
- Yes, sir. On your desk.

52:26.272 --> 52:28.395
- Sorry I'm late.
- I haven't waited long.

52:28.483 --> 52:30.772
- Cigarette?
- Yes. Thank you.

52:32.320 --> 52:34.063
How are plans developing?

52:34.155 --> 52:37.275
I made the last deposit to
Mrs Phillips' account today.

52:37.367 --> 52:38.612
Sit down.

52:38.701 --> 52:40.990
That completes the
amount you wanted paid.

52:41.079 --> 52:43.996
- Good. Any problems?
- No, but...

52:44.999 --> 52:47.786
Joyce asked some very
pertinent questions.

52:47.877 --> 52:51.329
It is a lot of money. But they're
both convinced it was insurance.

52:51.422 --> 52:53.830
- You haven't mentioned this to anyone?
- No.

52:53.925 --> 52:55.882
Good.

52:55.969 --> 52:58.673
- You don't approve of me, do you?
- Well, I...

52:58.763 --> 53:02.262
Perkins and Little have been the
Merrick attorneys for years.

53:02.350 --> 53:04.841
So I thought it strange
you called me last month.

53:04.936 --> 53:09.183
That's why. Nobody would suspect anything
from you as originating with me.

53:09.274 --> 53:13.437
And you can start practising some more,
because here comes a high, fast one.

53:13.528 --> 53:15.817
I talked to Dr Giraud
at the medical centre.

53:15.905 --> 53:19.440
- The brain man?
- Yes. Best diagnostician in the country.

53:19.534 --> 53:21.194
I once studied with him.

53:21.286 --> 53:25.283
He says there's some chance...
a very, very small chance...

53:25.373 --> 53:28.374
that Helen Phillips' prognosis
may not be hopeless.

53:28.459 --> 53:29.289
Really?

53:29.377 --> 53:33.754
He says if doctors like Emil Hofer in
Zürich, Fuss in Vienna, Lehman in Munich

53:33.840 --> 53:39.047
could be persuaded to take her case, they
might be able to devise a way to operate.

53:40.054 --> 53:43.174
But you couldn't get them all
over here in a million years.

53:43.266 --> 53:48.142
We could get her over there. Hofer won't
leave Zürich, so it has to be Switzerland.

53:48.229 --> 53:52.393
Today Dr Giraud heard from Fuss. He
and Lehman could be there this spring

53:52.483 --> 53:54.393
for periodic consultations.

53:54.485 --> 54:00.654
They're willing to tell her they're taking
the case as a gesture to her late husband.

54:00.742 --> 54:04.574
You get all kinds of people to do
what you want, don't you, Merrick?

54:04.662 --> 54:10.083
That's fine, but... the expense. Somebody
will have to be with her all those months.

54:10.168 --> 54:12.623
Persuade her and Joyce
to sell the house.

54:12.712 --> 54:13.743
Who'd buy it?

54:13.838 --> 54:17.207
I know somebody who needs a
place exactly like that.

54:17.300 --> 54:21.214
He'll pay what some people might
think is a lot more than it's worth.

54:21.304 --> 54:25.432
Think it over. Figure out the best
way to present it all to her.

54:25.517 --> 54:29.431
Of course, don't let anyone
know about this either.

54:29.521 --> 54:33.055
- No one.
- No, of course not.

54:34.192 --> 54:38.024
Um... What are you going
to do with the house?

54:38.112 --> 54:42.525
I don't want any part of it.
You'll find a worthy use for it.

54:42.617 --> 54:44.693
Merrick, I, uh...

54:44.786 --> 54:48.736
I take back a lot of things
I thought about you.

54:50.667 --> 54:53.039
That's nice of you to say so.

54:54.295 --> 54:56.965
- What's all this?
- False knots.

54:57.048 --> 54:59.586
One of the first things
you learn in med school.

54:59.676 --> 55:04.219
You are wrapped up in this. Well,
goodbye. I'll be talking to you.

55:04.305 --> 55:06.631
Thanks. I'll find my way out.

55:16.276 --> 55:20.984
What you're asking is to change your manner
of living... which is your business...

55:21.072 --> 55:24.322
but also to pick up a
career which you dropped.

55:24.409 --> 55:27.326
Probably the most demanding
career you could choose.

55:27.412 --> 55:31.706
If you don't go on this time, we've tied
up good people and priceless facilities...

55:31.791 --> 55:34.911
- which is my business.
- I'm still asking it.

55:35.003 --> 55:41.752
If I can go back and graduate, will you
let me intern here at the medical centre?

55:47.432 --> 55:50.101
All right, Bob Merrick.
We'll try it.

55:50.185 --> 55:53.803
I've done a lot of things in medicine
I was warned were impossible.

55:53.897 --> 55:55.272
You won't regret it.

55:55.356 --> 55:59.057
When you studied with me years ago,
why weren't you so enthusiastic?

55:59.152 --> 56:04.490
- What a lot of time you've wasted!
- Yes, what a lot of time.

56:05.408 --> 56:07.484
Thank you, Doctor.

56:10.705 --> 56:14.240
The marshal gets on his white horse
and rides off with Wise Eagle.

56:14.334 --> 56:18.830
The marshal says, "Wise Eagle, ya reckon
them varmints'll head through the pass?"

56:18.922 --> 56:21.210
- Wise Eagle says...
- "Ug!"

56:21.299 --> 56:24.383
The marshal says, "We gotta
head 'em off. Come on."

56:24.469 --> 56:27.386
Next picture's the sheriff's office.
The marshal says:

56:27.472 --> 56:32.300
"Sheriff, what idea you got in that ornery
head of yours to stop them desperadoes?"

56:32.393 --> 56:34.185
The sheriff says...

56:34.270 --> 56:39.098
"Marshal, I don't like using shootin'
irons, but if I gotta use shootin' irons,

56:39.192 --> 56:42.228
I tell you, there ain't no
hombre this side of the Pecos

56:42.320 --> 56:45.191
is any better with shootin'
irons, less'n it's you."

56:45.281 --> 56:46.775
And Wise Eagle says...

56:46.866 --> 56:49.274
Oh. "Ug!"

56:49.369 --> 56:51.112
We're gettin' better!

56:51.204 --> 56:56.162
Listen, you two. Forget about the funnies.
I can't keep quiet any longer.

56:56.251 --> 56:59.999
- Silence, Judith.
- OK, Helen. Shoot.

57:00.088 --> 57:04.216
First of all, some of the best eye
doctors in Europe are interested in me,

57:04.300 --> 57:05.960
because of my husband, I guess.

57:06.052 --> 57:08.625
They want me to come
over for a consultation.

57:08.721 --> 57:12.589
- Helen, I couldn't be happier.
- Gee, that's marvellous! For free?

57:12.684 --> 57:16.302
Practically. But not the trip itself...
that's the other good news.

57:16.396 --> 57:18.721
So many wonderful
things have happened.

57:18.815 --> 57:22.978
We have the most fabulous offer for
the house and the lake frontage.

57:23.069 --> 57:25.145
Enough for an income
for Joyce and me.

57:25.238 --> 57:30.030
If the buyer takes the Brightwood acreage,
the hospital will be in good shape too.

57:30.118 --> 57:32.075
It's about time your life turned.

57:32.161 --> 57:38.200
It's ironic... I've never been to Europe,
and when I go, I won't be able to see it.

57:38.293 --> 57:41.294
But what a place to open your eyes.

57:41.379 --> 57:44.582
I have to leave by the end of
the month for Switzerland.

57:44.674 --> 57:47.675
I'll miss you two, for a long time.

57:47.760 --> 57:50.596
Heck, Helen. I'll write.

57:51.431 --> 57:54.348
Heck, Helen. I'll write.

57:54.434 --> 58:00.519
Switzerland sounds dreamy! You can get
a Swiss watch and learn to yodel!

58:00.607 --> 58:04.818
She's practically lived on the beach.
This Robinson must be a dreamboat.

58:04.903 --> 58:09.611
- Haven't you met him yet?
- She's keeping him all to herself.

58:09.699 --> 58:14.444
I think it's wonderful. It looks as if
they really mean a lot to each other.

58:14.537 --> 58:17.871
You know, it's very strange
knowing you only like this.

58:17.957 --> 58:21.042
So well, it seems, and yet...

58:23.171 --> 58:25.460
I've never seen your face.

58:28.051 --> 58:30.127
- Hi, Joyce!
- Hi, Judy!

58:30.220 --> 58:33.635
- Any room left on the beach for us?
- Sure. You kiddin'?

58:33.723 --> 58:38.266
Helen, the news sounds just wonderful,
but I'm afraid I have to go.

58:38.353 --> 58:43.430
Oh, no. No, don't go. It's Joyce, and
now you'll have a chance to meet her.

58:43.525 --> 58:45.316
Joyce!

58:45.401 --> 58:48.521
Happy Sunday, Helen.
Joyce dragged me along.

58:48.613 --> 58:52.860
At long last, everybody. This is
Joyce Phillips, Tom Masterson,

58:52.951 --> 58:56.616
and this is Robbie Robinson I've
been telling you so much about.

58:56.704 --> 59:00.073
- Hello.
- How do you do, Mr... Robinson?

59:00.166 --> 59:01.791
How do you do?

59:01.876 --> 59:06.040
I'm sorry. I'm just on my way to the
village. I'm glad to have met you.

59:06.130 --> 59:08.206
Don't forget tomorrow.

59:10.051 --> 59:12.293
Goodbye, Helen.

59:12.387 --> 59:14.463
Goodbye.

59:16.224 --> 59:18.430
- Mr Robinson!
- Joyce!

59:18.518 --> 59:20.178
Could I ask you a favour?

59:20.270 --> 59:22.179
- Tom!
- Yes, Helen?

59:22.272 --> 59:25.308
- Tom, what's wrong?
- Why, nothing, Helen.

59:25.400 --> 59:29.267
- What is this?
- Look, Joyce, you don't understand.

59:29.362 --> 59:33.739
I sure don't. Hasn't she had enough trouble
from you without this fantastic lie?

59:33.825 --> 59:38.701
Believe me, I'm only trying to make
her life a little less lonely.

59:38.788 --> 59:43.746
Fine. Wouldn't it be wonderful for her to
fall in love with someone named Robinson

59:43.835 --> 59:46.124
and then open her eyes
and see that it's you?

59:46.212 --> 59:49.961
That would make us all glad
we're living, wouldn't it?

59:50.049 --> 59:54.296
Get out, Merrick. Get out
of her life and stay out.

59:58.766 --> 01:00:00.842
So long, pardner!

01:00:10.361 --> 01:00:13.481
- Goodbye, Helen.
- Goodbye, Tom.

01:00:13.573 --> 01:00:15.032
Come on, Helen.

01:00:15.116 --> 01:00:16.907
- Goodbye, Tom.
- Goodbye, Nancy.

01:00:16.993 --> 01:00:18.820
Hurry up, Joyce.

01:00:18.912 --> 01:00:20.703
I love you, darling.

01:00:23.082 --> 01:00:24.707
I'm coming.

01:00:24.792 --> 01:00:27.081
- Bye, darling.
- Goodbye, dear.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.636
Hello, Merrick.

01:00:46.814 --> 01:00:49.934
Everything's going to be all right.

01:01:59.929 --> 01:02:04.390
Now, Mrs Phillips, tell me
if you see a little light.

01:02:09.272 --> 01:02:11.311
Do you?

01:02:11.399 --> 01:02:13.475
No.

01:02:18.323 --> 01:02:20.481
Do you notice a light now?

01:02:21.868 --> 01:02:23.742
No, I'm sorry, gentlemen.

01:02:37.717 --> 01:02:40.920
Mrs Phillips, do you
have headaches?

01:02:42.096 --> 01:02:43.128
Yes.

01:02:43.223 --> 01:02:46.556
Constantly, or periodically?

01:02:46.643 --> 01:02:48.931
- Periodically.
- Mm-hm.

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:51.392
Where?

01:02:51.481 --> 01:02:54.054
In the back of my head.

01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:56.226
Any dizzy spells?

01:02:57.820 --> 01:02:59.363
Occasionally.

01:02:59.447 --> 01:03:01.736
Difficulties in walking?

01:03:02.992 --> 01:03:05.662
No... No.

01:03:06.788 --> 01:03:10.620
Well, I think that
does it for today.

01:03:10.708 --> 01:03:13.959
Well, Doctors? What's the verdict?

01:03:14.045 --> 01:03:17.331
You must be patient, Mrs
Phillips, you know.

01:03:17.423 --> 01:03:19.796
There are tests and tests.

01:03:19.884 --> 01:03:22.506
We are making progress.

01:03:22.595 --> 01:03:27.969
But I did distinguish some light yesterday,
and it was the same test, wasn't it?

01:03:28.059 --> 01:03:29.518
What does it mean?

01:03:29.602 --> 01:03:34.264
If you can bear with us, madame,
in time we'll find out.

01:03:54.586 --> 01:03:58.286
Oh, I don't know how
they dare call this tea.

01:03:58.381 --> 01:04:00.919
Back home it'd be a
six-course lunch.

01:04:03.136 --> 01:04:06.053
Why did I ever memorise
that calorie chart?

01:04:06.139 --> 01:04:09.674
I'm glad that's finished. Now I'm
only three letters behind Tom.

01:04:09.767 --> 01:04:12.389
- Want some tea, dear?
- Yes, thank you, Nancy.

01:04:12.478 --> 01:04:14.555
- Joyce?
- Yes?

01:04:14.647 --> 01:04:20.483
I'd like to send a note to Robbie Robinson,
if it wouldn't be too much trouble.

01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:21.981
Well, no.

01:04:22.071 --> 01:04:26.021
- Aren't you tired? It can wait, can't it?
- You should rest and relax,

01:04:26.117 --> 01:04:31.574
- not worry about your social obligations.
- It's no obligation. He'll be interested.

01:04:31.664 --> 01:04:34.868
And I want it to make the next
plane... just a note, Joyce.

01:04:34.959 --> 01:04:37.533
And you can say...

01:04:37.629 --> 01:04:39.752
that the tests have started

01:04:39.839 --> 01:04:42.674
and we're all very optimistic.

01:04:42.759 --> 01:04:46.803
And, uh... tell him
that I miss him...

01:04:46.888 --> 01:04:50.387
and to say hello to Judy...

01:04:50.475 --> 01:04:55.386
and the only part of Switzerland that
we've encountered is a hospital.

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:58.315
is a hospital.

01:05:05.073 --> 01:05:09.699
How do you explain it, Doctor? Her letter
sounds so optimistic, yet your reports...

01:05:09.786 --> 01:05:14.033
Now, now, Bob. How long has
she been there? A few weeks?

01:05:14.123 --> 01:05:16.697
Only Fuss and Hofer
have seen her so far.

01:05:16.793 --> 01:05:19.960
Naturally their reports to us
are going to sound cautious.

01:05:20.046 --> 01:05:23.296
Cautious? I'd say they
were pessimistic.

01:05:23.383 --> 01:05:28.923
Don't worry so much. Everything which
can be done for her is being done.

01:05:29.013 --> 01:05:30.342
I know.

01:05:30.431 --> 01:05:37.478
After all, we never anticipated more
than a medical possibility, did we?

01:05:38.898 --> 01:05:41.983
A medical possibility.

01:05:50.785 --> 01:05:53.490
Mrs Phillips! Good morning.

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:55.987
- You're Dr Fuss?
- Yes. Dr Fuss.

01:05:56.082 --> 01:05:59.498
- Please, sit down, Mrs Phillips.
- Oh, and you're Dr Hofer.

01:05:59.586 --> 01:06:01.662
- Jawohl.
- Good morning, madame.

01:06:01.754 --> 01:06:03.996
- And you're Dr Lehman.
- You're right.

01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:07.755
You see? I'm beginning
to recognise all of you.

01:06:07.844 --> 01:06:10.335
Well, at long last, the great day.

01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:13.633
I want you to know that
I've shot the works, too.

01:06:13.725 --> 01:06:18.054
That's American slang. That
means a new dress, a new hat...

01:06:21.441 --> 01:06:24.857
Now I want to know when you're going
to make a new girl out of me.

01:06:24.944 --> 01:06:28.693
Mrs Phillips, you have been close
to medicine for a few years.

01:06:28.781 --> 01:06:32.482
You know the relationship
of doctor and patient.

01:06:32.577 --> 01:06:38.829
You know that there is very little to
be gained by not facing the facts.

01:06:38.917 --> 01:06:40.993
Why, of course.

01:06:42.045 --> 01:06:44.452
By all means, face the facts.

01:06:46.382 --> 01:06:48.624
What are they?

01:06:48.718 --> 01:06:51.339
We are very sorry, Mrs Phillips,

01:06:51.429 --> 01:06:55.723
but we are agreed that, for the
present, we can do nothing.

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.596
No operation?

01:07:01.648 --> 01:07:05.313
- Nothing?
- We've searched every avenue, I believe.

01:07:05.401 --> 01:07:08.237
That's not to say there is no hope.

01:07:08.321 --> 01:07:11.238
In a case like yours, after
several years sometimes...

01:07:11.324 --> 01:07:12.984
Several years, Doctor?!

01:07:13.076 --> 01:07:18.746
We feel that it would be unwise and
unkind to submit you to surgery now.

01:07:18.831 --> 01:07:22.615
But you know that I'll let you experiment
if there's any chance at all...

01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:24.917
the longest chance in the world.

01:07:25.004 --> 01:07:29.465
We regret to say, but the
indications are not there.

01:07:30.927 --> 01:07:32.587
Oh.

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:38.674
Well, if the indications
aren't there, then...

01:07:38.768 --> 01:07:41.259
I guess that's that.

01:07:43.106 --> 01:07:46.391
You've done everything
that you could.

01:07:46.484 --> 01:07:49.189
It was a gamble.

01:07:49.279 --> 01:07:53.407
We all knew that it was
a gamble and I just...

01:07:53.491 --> 01:07:56.065
well, I just lost, that's all.

01:07:57.328 --> 01:08:01.575
But... I want to thank you.

01:08:01.666 --> 01:08:05.533
I want to thank you for
being so kind to me and...

01:08:05.628 --> 01:08:08.582
and giving me all your time.

01:08:09.632 --> 01:08:12.836
I really can't thank you enough.

01:08:12.927 --> 01:08:15.501
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:08:15.597 --> 01:08:18.514
- And...
- Goodbye, Mrs Phillips.

01:08:20.225 --> 01:08:22.716
The last must be Dr Lehman.

01:08:22.812 --> 01:08:25.303
My child...

01:08:25.398 --> 01:08:28.149
I am so sorry.

01:08:28.234 --> 01:08:33.904
Well, I... I thought I was
going to get rid of these.

01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:38.451
Isn't it nice that... that
I didn't throw them away?

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:04.136
She's sound asleep.

01:09:06.898 --> 01:09:10.848
What has she done that
all this happens to her?

01:09:11.778 --> 01:09:14.483
Golly. How she took it today...

01:09:16.658 --> 01:09:19.823
I don't know how she stands
up under everything.

01:09:19.911 --> 01:09:24.038
If it happened to me, I'd go to pot
in a handbasket. I think I'd even...

01:09:24.122 --> 01:09:27.290
I'm proud of you, Joyce.

01:09:27.377 --> 01:09:31.125
It hasn't been an easy
year for you either.

01:09:32.506 --> 01:09:36.125
Well, I'll go get these drops and
this new prescription filled.

01:09:36.219 --> 01:09:41.095
- Nancy, do me a favour.
- Of course. What?

01:09:41.182 --> 01:09:45.678
Stay away from here for a while
and relax yourself for a change.

01:09:45.770 --> 01:09:50.765
All right. I do need some fresh air.
I'll be back in an hour.

01:10:10.003 --> 01:10:14.297
- Darling. I thought you were asleep.
- I heard the door. Was it Nancy?

01:10:14.382 --> 01:10:19.009
Yes. She went out for a while. I can get
you one of your pills and some hot milk.

01:10:19.095 --> 01:10:21.669
Joyce, I don't need any sleep.

01:10:24.309 --> 01:10:26.385
Oh, yes, I do too.

01:10:27.437 --> 01:10:29.513
It's so awful in bed.

01:10:31.608 --> 01:10:35.985
It's funny, but... the
night-time is the worst time.

01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:38.740
It does get darker, you know.

01:10:39.991 --> 01:10:43.407
And then, when I finally
do get to sleep,

01:10:43.494 --> 01:10:48.571
I know that, when I wake up in the
morning, there won't be any dawn.

01:10:51.503 --> 01:10:52.961
Joyce...

01:10:53.046 --> 01:10:55.715
Joyce, forgive me.

01:10:55.798 --> 01:10:59.464
I didn't mean to
parade my emotions.

01:11:01.763 --> 01:11:04.384
Maybe I do need a pill.

01:11:04.474 --> 01:11:07.143
Would you mind getting
me some warm milk?

01:11:07.227 --> 01:11:09.800
Of course not.

01:11:09.896 --> 01:11:12.387
Just sit down here.

01:11:15.276 --> 01:11:17.068
I'll only be gone a moment.

01:11:17.153 --> 01:11:22.029
I'll just go down to the hotel
kitchen and warm some milk.

01:11:29.082 --> 01:11:32.700
- Are you all right?
- Yes, dear, I'm all right.

01:13:45.176 --> 01:13:46.421
Joyce?

01:13:48.137 --> 01:13:50.214
No.

01:13:54.018 --> 01:13:56.094
It's Rob.

01:13:57.564 --> 01:13:59.640
Rob?

01:14:12.078 --> 01:14:13.952
Oh, I can't believe it.

01:14:14.038 --> 01:14:17.039
- It's been so long.
- Much too long.

01:14:19.127 --> 01:14:23.705
When you didn't come to the plane,
and you hardly wrote all these months...

01:14:23.798 --> 01:14:26.716
Oh, I'm so glad you're here!

01:14:26.801 --> 01:14:29.257
You must have known how
much I need you now.

01:14:29.345 --> 01:14:30.626
Darling.

01:14:32.015 --> 01:14:35.763
Robbie, my trip has been wasted.

01:14:36.895 --> 01:14:41.640
- I found out today my case is hopeless.
- Don't talk about it.

01:14:41.733 --> 01:14:45.066
I came to tell you you're gonna
have the time of your life with me.

01:14:45.153 --> 01:14:49.649
I'll take you all the places you've been too
busy to visit, show you how to have fun.

01:14:49.741 --> 01:14:52.777
- But I'll be such trouble.
- Listen, Helen.

01:14:52.869 --> 01:14:57.863
You used to let me read you the funnies.
Let me be your eyes again.

01:14:57.957 --> 01:15:01.825
Now get dressed. Something
to bowl everybody ever.

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:05.917
I'm not only gonna show you the town,
I'm gonna show the town you.

01:15:06.007 --> 01:15:08.083
Oh, Robbie.

01:15:13.306 --> 01:15:14.551
Joyce?

01:15:15.058 --> 01:15:16.600
Joyce?

01:15:16.684 --> 01:15:19.389
Yes, Helen?

01:15:19.479 --> 01:15:24.022
Look who's here. Robbie Robinson.
It's like Old Home Week.

01:15:24.108 --> 01:15:25.900
This is a surprise.

01:15:25.985 --> 01:15:27.645
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:15:27.737 --> 01:15:32.399
We're gonna get dressed up to the teeth.
I'm going to initiate that new net dress.

01:15:34.244 --> 01:15:37.659
Joyce, will you please
come and help me?

01:15:38.248 --> 01:15:39.279
Oh!

01:15:39.374 --> 01:15:42.707
Oh, I'm all right.
I won't be very long.

01:15:50.593 --> 01:15:54.342
- I'll be back in just a moment, Helen.
- All right, Joyce.

01:15:58.226 --> 01:16:00.681
Bob Merrick, I...

01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:02.846
I want to apologise.

01:16:04.065 --> 01:16:05.310
You? For what?

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:11.153
That girl you just saw is quite a
change from the girl this afternoon.

01:16:11.239 --> 01:16:14.109
They told her she's
never going to see.

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:17.865
I know. I just came
from the institute.

01:16:17.954 --> 01:16:20.789
They've been keeping
in touch with me.

01:16:20.874 --> 01:16:24.741
Anybody that can do what you've
done for her is OK with me.

01:16:24.836 --> 01:16:27.541
I never believed names
were too important anyway.

01:16:27.630 --> 01:16:29.919
- Joyce!
- Coming!

01:16:41.519 --> 01:16:44.437
It's wonderful being with you.

01:16:44.522 --> 01:16:47.938
I don't want it to end, ever.

01:16:48.026 --> 01:16:51.359
Let's not think of it.
Tonight is our night.

01:16:51.446 --> 01:16:53.735
Yes, tonight is our night.

01:16:55.074 --> 01:16:59.452
Oh, and the fragrance
in the air... What is it?

01:16:59.537 --> 01:17:01.660
- Lilacs?
- Mm-hm.

01:17:01.748 --> 01:17:05.911
And there's a moon...
as there should be.

01:17:06.002 --> 01:17:11.245
Oh, and just ahead there's
lights of a little old town.

01:17:11.341 --> 01:17:14.757
Just as there should be.

01:17:24.646 --> 01:17:26.722
Excuse me a second, darling.

01:17:31.569 --> 01:17:34.606
- Ich nehme diesen hier.
- Danke.

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:37.944
I thought you might like these.

01:17:39.035 --> 01:17:41.407
- Lilacs?
- Mm-hm. For luck.

01:17:42.622 --> 01:17:44.698
And more lilacs.

01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:47.031
What's going on?

01:17:47.126 --> 01:17:48.325
Let's find out.

01:17:48.419 --> 01:17:50.661
Wenn ich das erklären darf?

01:17:50.755 --> 01:17:53.791
- Das ist ein lokales Volksfest.
- It's a local festival.

01:17:53.883 --> 01:17:56.588
- Man verbrennt die Hexe.
- They're burning a witch.

01:17:56.678 --> 01:17:59.548
- Damit wir eine gute Ernte haben.
- For a good harvest.

01:17:59.639 --> 01:18:02.759
- Mit Musik und Feuerwerk.
- With music and fireworks.

01:18:25.707 --> 01:18:31.211
There she is, darling. Way up on top of
a pile of branches about 20 feet high.

01:18:31.296 --> 01:18:35.245
Poor old gal's stuffed with straw,
just like our scarecrows back home.

01:18:35.341 --> 01:18:40.418
And on the ground just below her, boys
and girls in peasant dress are dancing.

01:19:05.371 --> 01:19:08.159
Now they're setting fire to her.

01:19:14.547 --> 01:19:16.456
There she goes.

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:23.389
Fireworks bursting
all over the place.

01:19:34.526 --> 01:19:38.144
- Now everybody's starting to dance.
- I'd like to dance too.

01:19:38.238 --> 01:19:39.898
You would?

01:19:39.989 --> 01:19:43.275
I always dance with my
eyes closed anyway.

01:20:31.958 --> 01:20:35.125
- I won't tell you what time it is.
- I don't want it to stop.

01:20:35.211 --> 01:20:38.829
I don't want to lose this place,
or the music, or the night.

01:20:38.923 --> 01:20:40.880
You don't have to lose it.

01:20:40.967 --> 01:20:44.134
I'd forgotten how happy I could be.

01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:48.847
You've helped me know that the world
isn't such a bad place after all.

01:20:48.933 --> 01:20:52.551
- You don't hate it any more?
- Not any more.

01:20:53.438 --> 01:20:56.522
Could you... forgive anything now?

01:20:56.608 --> 01:20:58.351
I think so.

01:20:58.443 --> 01:21:00.519
Yes.

01:21:00.612 --> 01:21:02.688
Even... Bob Merrick?

01:21:04.657 --> 01:21:06.733
Why...

01:21:10.455 --> 01:21:12.447
Yes, Bob.

01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:14.200
Of course.

01:21:14.292 --> 01:21:16.368
How long have you known?

01:21:16.461 --> 01:21:21.965
I don't really remember when I first had
the feeling that... Does it really matter?

01:21:22.050 --> 01:21:26.344
I love you, and I
want to marry you.

01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:30.348
Darling, if we only could.

01:21:30.433 --> 01:21:34.645
But I couldn't have you pitied
because of me. I love you too much.

01:21:34.729 --> 01:21:39.806
- Helen, I need you more than anything.
- Bob... Tomorrow.

01:21:41.736 --> 01:21:44.488
Let me tell you tomorrow.

01:21:45.406 --> 01:21:47.482
All right.

01:21:48.576 --> 01:21:51.826
Starting tomorrow,
we'll never be apart.

01:21:53.248 --> 01:21:55.324
Tomorrow.

01:22:07.554 --> 01:22:11.682
Well... it's really
good night this time.

01:22:11.766 --> 01:22:13.972
Oh, I wish it weren't.

01:22:26.281 --> 01:22:29.365
There's a brand-new
day in a few hours.

01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:31.075
Even better.

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.652
Nothing could be better, darling.

01:22:33.746 --> 01:22:35.822
I love you.

01:22:35.915 --> 01:22:37.991
Oh, Bob.

01:22:41.671 --> 01:22:43.747
Oh. The key.

01:22:46.759 --> 01:22:48.835
The key.

01:22:55.685 --> 01:22:57.761
Helen!

01:22:58.563 --> 01:23:01.268
- Did you have a good time?
- A wonderful time.

01:23:01.357 --> 01:23:02.900
How pretty.

01:23:02.984 --> 01:23:05.689
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:23:05.778 --> 01:23:08.779
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Yes.

01:23:11.034 --> 01:23:13.951
- Good night.
- Good night, Nancy.

01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:24.789
I'll take the flowers, Helen.

01:23:24.881 --> 01:23:27.798
Oh, they're so pretty.

01:23:27.884 --> 01:23:30.801
It was too wonderful, Nancy.

01:23:30.887 --> 01:23:33.378
He wants to do so much for me.

01:23:33.473 --> 01:23:36.758
Helen, what's the matter?

01:23:38.269 --> 01:23:40.677
He wants to marry me, Nancy.

01:23:40.772 --> 01:23:43.227
I love him. I can't let him do it.

01:23:43.316 --> 01:23:47.100
- Well, if you love him and he loves you...
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:23:47.195 --> 01:23:49.401
I don't know anything any more.

01:23:49.489 --> 01:23:52.490
- Nancy, please don't leave me.
- Of course I won't.

01:23:52.575 --> 01:23:54.651
You've got to help me.

01:24:11.135 --> 01:24:13.212
Helen?

01:24:14.305 --> 01:24:16.381
Nancy?

01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:19.176
Where is everybody?

01:24:27.527 --> 01:24:29.603
Hello?

01:24:30.238 --> 01:24:32.990
Oh, yes, please. Have him come up.

01:24:33.074 --> 01:24:34.699
Helen, Rob...

01:24:57.974 --> 01:25:01.141
Hello? Get me the desk, please.

01:25:07.734 --> 01:25:09.358
Come in.

01:25:09.444 --> 01:25:10.475
I see.

01:25:10.570 --> 01:25:13.690
Good morning. Couldn't order
a better day if we tried.

01:25:13.781 --> 01:25:16.070
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:25:17.076 --> 01:25:20.825
Is Helen dressed? I hope
you're not allergic to lilacs.

01:25:20.914 --> 01:25:24.579
Bob... What happened
to you two last night?

01:25:24.667 --> 01:25:30.207
- Did you tell her who you were?
- Yes. But she knew anyway. Joyce...

01:25:30.298 --> 01:25:32.836
I, uh... I asked her to marry me.

01:25:35.261 --> 01:25:37.337
Oh, Bob.

01:25:38.681 --> 01:25:42.216
- She's gone.
- She's?

01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:45.145
- Where?
- I don't know.

01:25:45.230 --> 01:25:48.100
Away with Nancy,
early this morning.

01:25:48.191 --> 01:25:51.311
Oh, here. She left
this note for you.

01:25:59.536 --> 01:26:02.655
"Dear Bob. Goodbye."

01:26:02.747 --> 01:26:06.033
"I'm sure this is
best for both of us."

01:26:06.125 --> 01:26:10.289
"You have your study and work now,
and I could only be a burden."

01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:13.297
"If you love me,
don't try to find me."

01:26:13.383 --> 01:26:18.009
"Just know you made me happier than
I dreamed I could ever be again. Helen."

01:26:20.431 --> 01:26:24.429
I phoned downstairs. Nobody
knows where she went.

01:26:24.519 --> 01:26:26.595
- We've got to go after her.
- But, Bob...

01:26:26.688 --> 01:26:30.021
We'll talk about it on the way.
We've got to find her.

01:26:31.734 --> 01:26:36.396
Miss Phillips, Mr Merrick, we are
doing everything to trace them...

01:26:36.489 --> 01:26:38.612
as are the police all over Europe.

01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:43.575
But from Milano... nothing to report.
Paris... no findings. Rome... nothing.

01:26:43.663 --> 01:26:46.699
You'd think in five weeks we'd
be able to find some trace.

01:26:46.791 --> 01:26:48.285
I am truly sorry, sir.

01:26:48.376 --> 01:26:50.665
But, you know,
even in your country,

01:26:50.753 --> 01:26:54.537
if someone really wants to
disappear, it is not too difficult.

01:26:56.009 --> 01:27:00.505
- However, we shall not give up.
- Thank you, Captain. Goodbye.

01:27:02.891 --> 01:27:06.094
I know what a sense of loss and
disappointment you both have,

01:27:06.186 --> 01:27:07.810
but look at these telegrams.

01:27:07.896 --> 01:27:11.395
Our Inter-Europa Agency has
tried everything, I assure you.

01:27:11.482 --> 01:27:14.234
Da ist ein Telegramm für mich?
Dankeschön.

01:27:14.319 --> 01:27:18.981
We have exhausted
all possibilities.

01:27:19.073 --> 01:27:20.354
Inter-Europa.

01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:24.364
Oui, madame. Lundi,
cinq... Exactement.

01:27:24.454 --> 01:27:26.446
Pas de quoi, madame.

01:27:32.545 --> 01:27:36.329
But we will be in touch
with our New York people.

01:27:36.424 --> 01:27:38.962
And I will keep on the lookout here

01:27:39.052 --> 01:27:41.673
for the two of them booking
passage to America.

01:27:41.763 --> 01:27:45.677
Here are your tickets.
Bon voyage. Have a nice trip.

01:27:45.767 --> 01:27:48.340
It was a pleasure serving you.

01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:11.328
Darling, you're home.

01:28:11.417 --> 01:28:13.493
Oh, am I glad to see you!

01:28:14.921 --> 01:28:17.626
- Welcome home, Bob.
- Hello, Tom. Good to see you.

01:28:17.715 --> 01:28:21.250
- Nothing? No trace?
- None.

01:28:21.344 --> 01:28:26.136
She must come back to the States.
Sooner or later they'll get in touch.

01:28:26.224 --> 01:28:29.924
- Strange how things work out, isn't it?
- Yeah, strange.

01:28:30.019 --> 01:28:31.977
What are your plans?

01:28:32.063 --> 01:28:37.270
I don't know. I guess I'll...
go up to Brightwood for a while.

01:29:00.675 --> 01:29:04.210
The marshal gets on his white horse
and rides off with Wise Eagle.

01:29:04.304 --> 01:29:08.432
The marshal says, "Wise Eagle, ya reckon
them varmints'll head through the pass?"

01:29:08.516 --> 01:29:10.473
- Wise Eagle says...
- "Ug"

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.459
- Mr Merrick?
- Yes.

01:29:35.543 --> 01:29:39.078
Mr Randolph had to leave
Brightwood for a few months.

01:29:39.172 --> 01:29:42.256
Will you excuse me? I just came
over to close up the house.

01:29:42.342 --> 01:29:44.418
Yes, certainly.

01:30:01.152 --> 01:30:05.280
Once you go into it, you're bound.
You'll never give it up.

01:30:05.365 --> 01:30:09.943
You'll find it'll furnish your motive
power. It will obsess you.

01:30:10.036 --> 01:30:14.081
But, believe me, it'll be
a magnificent obsession.

01:30:59.169 --> 01:31:01.494
- Chris, here's Doctor.
- Dr Merrick!

01:31:01.588 --> 01:31:03.960
- All ready to leave us, Chris?
- All set.

01:31:04.048 --> 01:31:06.124
- Good!
- I wanna show you something.

01:31:06.217 --> 01:31:08.293
Oh. All right.

01:31:09.345 --> 01:31:11.421
Look at me.

01:31:12.098 --> 01:31:14.969
Not dizzy or anything. You
sure know how to operate!

01:31:15.059 --> 01:31:17.597
Dr Barnes had more to
do with it than I did.

01:31:17.687 --> 01:31:23.808
Now I can go to that new school out in
the country. They got horses and dogs.

01:31:23.902 --> 01:31:26.819
That's just fine. Goodbye, Chris.

01:31:26.905 --> 01:31:30.902
Just a minute, Doctor. Chris,
I want to talk to Doctor a minute.

01:31:30.992 --> 01:31:33.198
Dr Merrick, you've
been wonderful to us.

01:31:33.286 --> 01:31:35.113
Not just here in the hospital.

01:31:35.205 --> 01:31:40.032
You arranged that school for Chris,
and my husband's job at the plant.

01:31:40.126 --> 01:31:44.171
- You haven't told him that I?
- No. That's just between us, like you said.

01:31:44.255 --> 01:31:47.505
But in a few years, when Chris
understands about money...

01:31:47.592 --> 01:31:50.344
No, Mrs Miller. I told you
there's nothing to repay.

01:31:50.428 --> 01:31:52.753
In a few years it'll
be all used up anyway.

01:31:52.847 --> 01:31:56.382
- All used up?
- That's right, Mrs Miller. Goodbye.

01:32:00.605 --> 01:32:05.979
I had quite an experience at the golf club.
After 20 years I almost got a hole in one.

01:32:06.069 --> 01:32:11.063
I took her to a beautiful French restaurant,
but all she wanted was spaghetti.

01:32:11.157 --> 01:32:12.651
Bob Merrick!

01:32:12.742 --> 01:32:15.114
Dr Giraud! For heaven's sake!
How are you?

01:32:15.203 --> 01:32:18.287
- You're underweight, but you look fine.
- I feel fine.

01:32:18.373 --> 01:32:22.322
Doctors, please! This
is a very tense moment.

01:32:22.919 --> 01:32:23.950
Check.

01:32:24.045 --> 01:32:26.002
Say, what are you doing here?

01:32:26.089 --> 01:32:30.039
Just been seeing your chief. He told me
you did a nice job on that trephining.

01:32:30.134 --> 01:32:34.179
I told him I taught you all you know.
You'll be a real neurosurgeon after all.

01:32:34.264 --> 01:32:35.722
That's the idea, Doctor.

01:32:35.807 --> 01:32:38.594
Never hurts to take time off
to build up the batteries.

01:32:38.685 --> 01:32:42.184
I took a week off. Went to Joyce
and Tom Masterson's wedding.

01:32:42.272 --> 01:32:44.145
- When was that?
- Well, let's see.

01:32:44.232 --> 01:32:48.099
She's in Maternity now with her first baby.
It must have been a year ago.

01:32:48.194 --> 01:32:50.768
Maybe work is the best answer.

01:32:51.531 --> 01:32:54.448
You... never heard anything again?

01:32:54.534 --> 01:32:59.362
No. I never heard from her. Supposedly
she and Nancy came back to the States.

01:32:59.455 --> 01:33:01.448
Dr Merrick, please.

01:33:01.541 --> 01:33:04.411
You're being paged. Must be
an important man, Doctor.

01:33:04.502 --> 01:33:08.749
Don't stay away so long, Doctor.
We need critics around here. Goodbye.

01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:16.637
The book says if they don't
gain it back in five days...

01:33:16.723 --> 01:33:21.135
Book, shmook. There ought to be a law
new fathers couldn't read anything.

01:33:21.227 --> 01:33:23.516
Come in.

01:33:23.813 --> 01:33:25.188
- Hello, Doctor.
- Tom.

01:33:25.273 --> 01:33:27.515
- How's the little mother?
- A lot littler.

01:33:27.609 --> 01:33:32.152
I have a formal complaint. Some nurse
came and took my baby away.

01:33:32.238 --> 01:33:36.817
All you can supply is psychological
nourishment, which she doesn't need yet.

01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:39.483
- Everything all right?
- Fine. I go home Monday.

01:33:39.579 --> 01:33:42.200
Good. I'll look in on you tomorrow.

01:33:42.290 --> 01:33:46.240
- Give little Helen an extra hug for me.
- Sure.

01:33:48.004 --> 01:33:50.293
Goodbye, Doctor.

01:33:50.381 --> 01:33:52.754
He's doing his life
over the hard way.

01:33:52.842 --> 01:33:57.006
I imagine any other way
would be the hard way now.

01:34:03.686 --> 01:34:08.265
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Good evening, Williams. Thank you.

01:34:14.322 --> 01:34:17.572
- Hello, Bob.
- Edward Randolph. Good to see you.

01:34:17.659 --> 01:34:20.197
How long have you been here?

01:34:20.286 --> 01:34:23.786
I phoned the hospital. They
said you were on your way home.

01:34:23.873 --> 01:34:25.782
And...

01:34:26.751 --> 01:34:28.791
What is it?

01:34:28.878 --> 01:34:31.500
Helen.

01:34:31.589 --> 01:34:34.080
- Do you know where she is?
- Nancy called.

01:34:34.175 --> 01:34:37.260
Said she was breaking her word...
thank goodness she did.

01:34:37.345 --> 01:34:40.631
- Helen must be desperately ill, Bob.
- What?!

01:34:40.723 --> 01:34:44.851
They're afraid of pneumonia,
other complications.

01:34:45.728 --> 01:34:48.765
- Where are they?
- In a little hospital in New Mexico.

01:34:48.857 --> 01:34:50.933
Shadow Mountain.

01:34:54.654 --> 01:34:57.489
I've already called about tickets.

01:34:57.574 --> 01:35:02.816
- How soon can we leave?
- The 9:00 plane. We'll get there at dawn.

01:35:16.342 --> 01:35:18.631
Doctor, that's their car.

01:35:33.985 --> 01:35:35.728
- At last you're here.
- Finally.

01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:38.655
- I've only done what she asked me.
- I know. How is she?

01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:41.860
In a coma. No change since
you called from the airport.

01:35:41.951 --> 01:35:47.159
- Dr Allan, Dr Merrick, Mr Randolph.
- How do you do? This way, Doctor.

01:35:48.333 --> 01:35:49.993
Nancy...

01:35:58.468 --> 01:36:00.959
She was admitted a month ago.

01:36:24.661 --> 01:36:27.234
May I see the history, please?

01:36:33.586 --> 01:36:36.124
It's the pneumonococcus now.

01:36:36.214 --> 01:36:39.001
When she was admitted,
headaches, nausea,

01:36:39.092 --> 01:36:41.298
not connected with her
blindness at all.

01:36:41.386 --> 01:36:43.924
It's pressure. Have you
done a spinal puncture?

01:36:44.013 --> 01:36:48.722
One. Starting yesterday, she
deteriorated so fast, we had to.

01:36:48.810 --> 01:36:53.602
Another odd thing. This apparent paralysis
of the left arm and the respiratory centre.

01:36:53.690 --> 01:36:57.770
Couldn't be a stroke.
The onset was so gradual.

01:36:57.861 --> 01:37:01.609
No. But it could be a fibroma.

01:37:01.698 --> 01:37:03.525
Her old injury.

01:37:03.616 --> 01:37:06.534
I know something about it.
It might have caused a clot

01:37:06.619 --> 01:37:08.778
which became organised
and fibrotic.

01:37:16.254 --> 01:37:17.914
I...

01:37:19.007 --> 01:37:21.295
always dance...

01:37:21.384 --> 01:37:24.883
with my eyes closed.

01:37:26.389 --> 01:37:30.256
Well, Doctor? What do you suggest?

01:37:30.351 --> 01:37:33.555
If we could only get Henry
Giraud to fly out here.

01:37:33.646 --> 01:37:35.935
There isn't time for that.

01:37:38.151 --> 01:37:40.393
Is there?

01:37:43.656 --> 01:37:46.326
No, there's no time for that.

01:37:46.409 --> 01:37:49.743
I agree. We should operate
as soon as possible.

01:37:49.829 --> 01:37:51.656
Let's have a look at Surgery.

01:37:54.292 --> 01:37:55.786
- Doctor...
- This way?

01:37:55.877 --> 01:37:59.328
Doctor, I couldn't do it.
I've never used a Hudson Burr.

01:37:59.422 --> 01:38:04.131
- Isn't there anyone else?
- Here? This is just a private sanatorium.

01:38:04.219 --> 01:38:09.177
Four of us on the staff. Not one of
us could take that responsibility.

01:38:09.265 --> 01:38:11.341
- Do you want it?
- I?

01:38:12.477 --> 01:38:15.229
I don't have enough experience.

01:38:15.313 --> 01:38:18.100
- You can't expect me to...
- Bob.

01:38:21.736 --> 01:38:24.144
A chance in a thousand.

01:38:24.239 --> 01:38:26.397
A chance in a million.

01:38:26.491 --> 01:38:29.408
You've got to give it to her.

01:38:33.998 --> 01:38:36.205
Edward, I can't.

01:38:36.292 --> 01:38:40.919
You're not gonna let everything you've
lived for all these years slip away?

01:38:41.005 --> 01:38:44.457
You've gone so far, Bob. So far.

01:38:46.761 --> 01:38:49.881
I'd give my life to save her.

01:38:49.973 --> 01:38:54.635
You just give your skill.
You're ready for it.

01:38:54.727 --> 01:39:01.394
Now you're gonna repay that old, old
debt in a way that you never imagined.

01:39:15.582 --> 01:39:18.286
Nancy, will you help scrub?

01:39:18.376 --> 01:39:20.250
I'll be glad to, Doctor.

01:40:14.641 --> 01:40:16.099
Remove the dressing.

01:40:20.730 --> 01:40:22.888
2cc of Pentothal sodium.

01:40:31.741 --> 01:40:33.817
We're almost ready, Doctor.

01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:35.986
Dr Merrick?

01:40:41.125 --> 01:40:46.333
- What's the trouble?
- Doctor, you begin. I'll stand by.

01:40:46.422 --> 01:40:48.748
Just a moment, please, Doctor.

01:40:48.842 --> 01:40:53.669
You can't let that girl down.
You just can't!

01:40:53.763 --> 01:40:56.254
Nancy, I'm not up to it.

01:40:57.517 --> 01:40:59.675
I just won't be able to...

01:41:14.617 --> 01:41:16.277
Nancy, let's start.

01:41:20.665 --> 01:41:23.500
- Ready?
- Go ahead.

01:41:23.585 --> 01:41:25.661
All right, Doctor.

01:42:37.534 --> 01:42:42.279
It was the longest and
roughest operation I ever saw.

01:42:42.372 --> 01:42:45.657
Pretty feathery there
for a while, wasn't it?

01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:49.582
It's going to be feathery
until she comes to.

01:43:42.182 --> 01:43:46.594
- You'd better get some rest now.
- No.

01:43:46.686 --> 01:43:49.806
Thank you, Nancy,
but I couldn't sleep.

01:43:50.732 --> 01:43:54.480
- I'll make some coffee for you.
- All right.

01:44:35.818 --> 01:44:37.895
Doctor.

01:44:41.741 --> 01:44:43.983
Nancy?

01:44:44.077 --> 01:44:46.746
Nancy's here. I'm here.

01:44:47.747 --> 01:44:50.368
- Doctor?
- Yes.

01:44:50.458 --> 01:44:52.866
You must be quiet.

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:55.996
It doesn't hurt so much.

01:44:58.842 --> 01:45:01.415
You're going to get better.

01:45:02.345 --> 01:45:04.421
Who is it?

01:45:06.307 --> 01:45:08.383
Who's here?

01:45:10.228 --> 01:45:12.304
It's Bob.

01:45:14.065 --> 01:45:16.141
Bob?

01:45:17.151 --> 01:45:20.651
Oh, Bob, I'm so glad you're here.

01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:25.029
Hold me.

01:45:25.118 --> 01:45:27.194
Hold me close.

01:45:29.163 --> 01:45:31.240
I didn't know.

01:45:32.208 --> 01:45:34.284
You didn't tell me.

01:45:35.336 --> 01:45:37.412
Lie still. Please.

01:45:44.345 --> 01:45:46.836
What is that?

01:45:46.931 --> 01:45:49.683
Helen, you've got to be quiet.

01:45:50.935 --> 01:45:53.224
But I think I see some light.

01:45:54.272 --> 01:45:56.728
Are you sure?

01:45:56.816 --> 01:45:59.983
You mustn't talk. Just rest.

01:46:01.112 --> 01:46:04.730
But I'm going to see! I know I am!

01:46:06.701 --> 01:46:08.777
Am I?

01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:11.159
Yes, my darling.

01:46:11.247 --> 01:46:13.785
You are going to see.

01:46:15.043 --> 01:46:16.751
I can see you.

01:46:18.046 --> 01:46:21.628
Please lie still. You must.

01:46:22.926 --> 01:46:25.547
Don't get excited. Not today.

01:46:27.472 --> 01:46:31.801
May I... May I get excited tomorrow?

01:46:32.894 --> 01:46:34.139
Yes.

01:46:35.813 --> 01:46:37.605
And you'll be with me?

01:46:37.690 --> 01:46:42.103
Yes, darling. I'll be
with you tomorrow.

01:46:46.241 --> 01:46:48.482
Starting tomorrow,

01:46:48.576 --> 01:46:50.652
we'll never be apart.

01:46:51.621 --> 01:46:53.080
Tomorrow.

01:46:54.290 --> 01:46:56.366
Tomorrow.

01:46:58.545 --> 01:47:00.621
Oh, tomorrow.

01:47:06.344 --> 01:47:10.591
Once you find the
way, you'll be bound.

01:47:10.682 --> 01:47:12.805
It'll obsess you.

01:47:12.892 --> 01:47:17.353
But, believe me, it'll be
a magnificent obsession.
