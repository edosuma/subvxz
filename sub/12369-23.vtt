00:02.168 --> 00:03.211
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:03.294 --> 00:05.338
IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.422 --> 00:06.715
- HEY, EVERYBODY.

00:06.798 --> 00:08.383
OUR GROUP BIRTHDAY
IS COMING UP,

00:08.466 --> 00:11.219
AND I KNOW EXACTLY WHO I WANT
TO BE FIXED UP WITH.

00:11.302 --> 00:13.555
I MET A MAN THIS YEAR
WHO TOUCHED ME DEEPLY.

00:13.638 --> 00:17.892
- THAT COULD BE
HALF OF CLEVELAND.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.603
- IT'S OUR POETRY PROFESSOR--
ROBIN YORK.

00:20.687 --> 00:23.273
HE'S SO SPIRITUAL
AND SENSITIVE.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.400
- WELL, I WANT THAT GUY
THAT WE MET

00:25.483 --> 00:27.777
AT THE PETSMART CHARITIES
ADOPTION THING.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.280
HIS NAME IS REX.

00:30.363 --> 00:33.074
OR MAYBE HIS DOG'S NAME
IS REX.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.076
- WELL, NOW THAT
I'M ENGAGED,

00:35.160 --> 00:37.287
OF COURSE I DON'T NEED
AN ACTUAL DATE.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.497
WHICH IS A GOOD THING,
CONSIDERING THE FREAKS

00:39.581 --> 00:41.458
YOU GUYS
HAVE SET ME UP WITH--

00:41.541 --> 00:43.752
MAN BOOBS,
CONJOINED TWINS,

00:43.835 --> 00:46.254
HUMAN TAIL.

00:46.337 --> 00:48.757
- OH, COME ON.
THAT LAST GUY WAS PERFECT,

00:48.840 --> 00:49.799
EXCEPT FOR THE TAIL.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.927
- DID YOU HEAR
WHAT YOU JUST SAID?

00:53.011 --> 00:55.263
NO, NO, THIS TIME,
I JUST WANT A BUSINESS DATE.

00:55.346 --> 00:57.974
I REALLY WANT A PART
IN THE NEXT WES O'ROURKE MOVIE.

00:58.057 --> 00:59.768
- THE INDIE FILM DIRECTOR?
- YEAH.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.603
- HE WENT TO SCHOOL
WITH MY FILM PROFESSOR.

01:01.686 --> 01:03.104
I CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.147
- EXCELLENT.

01:04.230 --> 01:04.980
[knock on door]

01:05.063 --> 01:08.318
- KNOCK, KNOCK.
LOOK WHAT I BROUGHT.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.779
- OOH, BREAKFAST WINE.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.948
- IT'S GLOB WINE,
WHICH STANDS

01:14.032 --> 01:17.160
FOR "GORGEOUS LADIES
OF BOWLING..."

01:17.243 --> 01:18.828
WINE.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.289

- THAT WAS OUR TEAM.

01:22.791 --> 01:26.503
1962 AND '63
CITY CHAMPIONS.

01:26.586 --> 01:29.631
- THEY PREEMPTED
THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS SPEECH

01:29.714 --> 01:33.343
FOR OUR
CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.636
- YOU COULDN'T WALK
AROUND THIS CITY

01:34.719 --> 01:37.013
WITHOUT HEARING THE SOUND
OF FALLING PINS

01:37.096 --> 01:38.765
AND PEOPLE CRYING
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT

01:38.848 --> 01:41.851
THE WORLD WAS
GOING TO END.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.146
- WE BOUGHT THIS WINE
AND SAID WE'D DRINK IT TOGETHER

01:45.230 --> 01:46.689
IN 50 YEARS.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.359
- ONLY, WE LOST TRACK
OF THE OTHERS.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.528
- THAT'S WHAT I WANT
FOR MY BIRTHDATE--

01:51.611 --> 01:54.030
REUNITE THE OLD GANG.

01:54.113 --> 01:57.742
- WELL, I CAN DO THAT.
WHO ARE THEY?

01:57.826 --> 01:59.494
- THERE'S ELKA AND ME.

01:59.577 --> 02:03.706
ALL WE NEED TO FIND
IS DIANE, ANGIE, AND PEG.

A FRIEND OF YOURS
WANTED DINNER WITH ME,

04:03.534 --> 04:05.954
IT WAS JUST YOUR CLEVER WAY

JOY, SHOULD WE, UH,

04:27.433 --> 04:30.395

04:36.109 --> 04:38.653
BUT YOU ALMOST SEEM
DISAPPOINTED TO BE WITH ME

04:38.736 --> 04:39.696

04:51.582 --> 04:56.004
YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHT
SHINING FROM HER SOUL.

AFTER ALL.

06:55.373 --> 06:56.374
- OKAY, LADIES,
THIS WINE'S GONNA TAKE

06:56.457 --> 06:58.501
ABOUT 20 MINUTES
TO BREATHE.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.212
- LOOK AT US--
BACK TOGETHER.

07:01.295 --> 07:02.755
[all laughing]
- OH.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.132
- LET'S SEE,
ELKA WAS THE BOMBSHELL,

07:04.215 --> 07:06.801
I WAS THE LEGS,
DIANE WAS THE BRAINS...

07:06.884 --> 07:07.844
- NO.

07:07.927 --> 07:08.845
- AND MAMIE SUE
WAS THE DITZ.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.013
- NO, YOU
WERE THE BOMBSHELL,

07:11.097 --> 07:13.474
DIANE WAS THE LEGS,
AND MAMIE SUE

07:13.558 --> 07:17.145
WAS THE DITZ.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.396
- I WAS THE LEGS.

07:18.479 --> 07:19.689
[chuckles]

07:19.772 --> 07:21.566
ANGIE WAS THE BRAINS,

07:21.649 --> 07:24.402
AND MAMIE SUE
WAS THE...

07:24.485 --> 07:27.196
DITZ.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.365
- WELL, THE JOKE'S
ON ALL OF YOU.

07:29.448 --> 07:31.409
YOU'RE NOT
ANY OF THOSE THINGS ANYMORE,

07:31.492 --> 07:35.872
BUT I'M STILL DITZY.

07:40.168 --> 07:44.547
- LOOKING AROUND THIS TABLE,
I HAVE TO ASK ONE QUESTION.

07:44.630 --> 07:49.218
HOW DID YOU ALL
GET SO OLD?

07:50.845 --> 07:52.763
- WELL, IT'S GREAT
TO SEE YOU GUYS.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.933
- HOW DID WE LET
SO MANY YEARS GO BY?

07:56.017 --> 07:57.643
- I KNOW.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.437
BECAUSE AFTER
WE WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP,

07:59.520 --> 08:01.439
THE FAME WENT
TO OUR HEADS,

08:01.522 --> 08:02.857
AND YOU ALL BECAME DIVAS,

08:02.940 --> 08:05.902
WHICH LED
TO A VERY UGLY BREAKUP.

08:07.528 --> 08:09.030
- THANKS, MAMIE SUE.

08:09.113 --> 08:12.408
I THINK THAT WAS MORE
OF A RHETORICAL QUESTION.

08:12.491 --> 08:15.411
- FAME DID NOT GO
TO MY HEAD.

08:15.494 --> 08:17.622
- OH, YEAH?
WHO GOT THE SPONSOR

08:17.705 --> 08:20.666
TO CUT THE REST OF US
OUT OF THAT OVALTINE COMMERCIAL?

08:20.750 --> 08:22.293
- HE ONLY WANTED ME.

08:22.376 --> 08:24.420
- YEAH, AND AFTER
HE HAD YOU,

08:24.503 --> 08:27.632
YOU WERE IN,
AND WE WERE OUT.

08:27.715 --> 08:31.260
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU WERE THE TRAMP.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.722
- NO, ELKA WAS THE TRAMP.

08:34.804 --> 08:36.307
ALWAYS BACKING UP
INTO A HAND DRYER,

08:36.390 --> 08:39.809
SO IT WOULD BLOW
HER BOWLING SKIRT UP.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.647
- THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

08:42.730 --> 08:45.233
EVERY TIME.

08:46.984 --> 08:49.403
AT LEAST I DIDN'T LEAVE
FOR ANOTHER TEAM.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.782
- I JUST COULDN'T STAND DIANE
AND ANGIE ALWAYS FIGHTING.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.284
- YEAH, YOUR FIGHT
RUINED OUR CHANCE

08:55.368 --> 08:57.161
AT THE <i> LIFE</i> MAGAZINE COVER.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.288
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT REALLY
BROKE UP THE TEAM.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.164
- YEAH.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.582
- HOW COME SHE GOT
TO BE IN THE CENTER

09:01.666 --> 09:03.501
OF EVERY PICTURE?

09:03.584 --> 09:07.088
- BECAUSE I HAD
THE SMILE.

09:07.171 --> 09:08.839
- YEAH, YEAH,
YOUR SMILE WAS SO BIG,

09:08.923 --> 09:11.342
IT PUSHED THE REST OF US
OUT OF FRAME.

09:11.425 --> 09:15.763
- BETTER MY SMILE
THAN YOUR HIPS.

09:15.846 --> 09:18.808
- WATCH IT, SUNSHINE.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.977
WATCH THAT MOUTH.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.228
- SHE WAS JUST KIDDING.
- YOU HAVE ALWAYS SAID

09:22.311 --> 09:23.312
CATTY THINGS--

09:23.396 --> 09:25.815
- STOP IT, YOU GUYS!
- OH, THERE'S LOTS OF STUFF--

09:25.898 --> 09:30.027
- IT'S 1963
ALL OVER AGAIN.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.946
THE WINE NEEDS
20 MINUTES TO BREATHE,

09:32.029 --> 09:34.532
AND I THINK WE DO TOO.

09:34.615 --> 09:37.159
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A BREAK
AND GET SOME FRESH AIR?

09:37.243 --> 09:41.664
- MAMIE SUE,
WE'RE ALREADY OUTSIDE.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.207
- FINE.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.502
I'M GOING INSIDE
FOR SOME STALE AIR.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.296
- ME TOO.

09:48.379 --> 09:51.632
- ME TOO.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.344
- AREN'T YOU GOING?

09:55.428 --> 09:58.055
- WHY SHOULD I GO?
YOU GO.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.890
- I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.852
- WELL, FINE.
NEITHER AM I.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.646
- FINE.
- FINE.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.731
- WE'LL JUST SIT HERE

10:06.814 --> 10:08.858
AND SAY NOTHING
TO EACH OTHER.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.068
NOTHING AT ALL.
NOT A THING.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.695
NOT A WORD.
NOT ONE WORD.

10:12.778 --> 10:16.115
- COULD THAT START NOW?

10:18.534 --> 10:20.244
- QUESTION.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.747
WHO ARE YOUR TOP FIVE
JAPANESE DIRECTORS?

10:22.830 --> 10:25.708
- ONLY FIVE?

10:25.791 --> 10:27.543
I WILL ANSWER
THAT EXCELLENT QUESTION

10:27.626 --> 10:29.545
AS SOON
AS WE'VE ORDERED DINNER.

10:29.628 --> 10:33.132
AND I AM CERTAINLY NOT THE TYPE
OF PERSON WHO WOULD SAY,

10:33.215 --> 10:37.261
"SIRI, WHO ARE THE TOP FIVE
JAPANESE DIRECTORS?"

10:37.345 --> 10:39.722
- LET'S SEE,
WHAT'S GOOD HERE?

10:39.805 --> 10:42.725
HUH.

10:48.606 --> 10:52.276
I'M THINKING
ABOUT THE DUCK.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.697
- SO AM I.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.077
- MY DATE
IS A PLASTIC SURGEON.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.578
TAKE A LOOK
AT ME RIGHT NOW.

11:02.661 --> 11:05.956
THIS IS THE WORST
I'M EVER GONNA LOOK.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.292
- WE SHOULD INTRODUCE HIM
TO MY DATE...

11:08.376 --> 11:11.253
WHO HAS
WEBBED HANDS.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.254
- WHAT?
YOU MEAN LIKE A FROG?

11:12.338 --> 11:16.550
- OH, SURE, LIKE A FROG
OR A DUCK, A PLATYPUS,

11:16.634 --> 11:20.763
NONE OF WHICH WOULD DRAW COMMENT
IF WE WERE DINING IN A POND.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.390
- JOY, HOW'S YOUR DATE?

11:22.473 --> 11:23.808
- HARD TO SAY.

11:23.891 --> 11:26.227
- YOU'RE NOT SURE?
- NO.

11:26.310 --> 11:29.313
THE WORDS ARE LITERALLY
HARD TO SAY.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.690
HE PREFERS ELKA TO ME.

11:31.774 --> 11:35.653
A 91-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
TO ME.

11:35.736 --> 11:39.240
- WEBBED HANDS.

11:39.323 --> 11:42.827
- PLASTIC SURGEON.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.621
SORRY.
IT'S REALLY FUN TO WIN.

11:45.704 --> 11:48.082
- OKAY, I JUST HAVE
TO GO OUT THERE

11:48.165 --> 11:50.292
AND SHOW HIM
THAT I AM A DEEP ACTRESS,

11:50.376 --> 11:53.295
WHO IS UNCONCERNED
WITH SUPERFICIAL THINGS,

11:53.379 --> 11:56.632
AND JUST IGNORE
THE SLIGHT THWAPPING SOUND

11:56.715 --> 11:59.093
WHENEVER HE GESTURES.

11:59.176 --> 12:04.014
- I HAVE GOT TO SHOW ROBIN
THAT I'M JUST AS DESIRABLE

12:04.098 --> 12:09.145
AS A WOMAN PUSHING 100.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.521
- WELL, I JUST NEED
TO PLAY IT COOL.

12:10.604 --> 12:11.981
I CAN'T LET HIM KNOW
HOW MUCH I WANT HIM

12:12.064 --> 12:14.984
TO KNOCK ME OUT
AND CUT ME UP.

12:15.067 --> 12:18.988
'CAUSE THAT'S
THIRD-DATE TALK.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.532
- AND THERE ARE
SO MANY EXCITING NEW WAYS

12:21.615 --> 12:23.951
TO TEASE THE FILM
ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.953
THERE'S TWITTER,
UH, PODCASTS,

12:26.036 --> 12:29.081
WEBISODES.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.295
- [shakily] PLEASE TELL ME
MORE ABOUT YOUR FILM.

12:34.378 --> 12:36.714
THE PART OF NORA
REALLY SPEAKS TO ME.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.466
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

12:38.549 --> 12:41.343
SHE'S A TORTURED,
GRITTY CHARACTER.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.512
YOU'RE PRIMARILY KNOWN
AS A SOAP ACTRESS.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.514
- OH, PLEASE,
AFTER THE WOODY ALLEN MOVIE,

12:45.598 --> 12:47.016
PEOPLE DON'T EVEN
THINK OF ME THAT WAY.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.602
- HEY!
YOU'RE HONOR ST. RAVEN.

12:49.685 --> 12:52.646
YOU WERE ON THAT SOAP.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.607
- EXCUSE ME.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:54.690 --> 12:56.859
- OH, I'M WITH THE OLD BROADS,
BUT THEY'RE FIGHTING,

12:56.942 --> 13:01.405
SO I'D RATHER SIT WITH YOU
AND RAGGEDY ANDY HERE.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.662
- THAT'S NICE.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.790
- WOW, YOU DON'T
SEE THAT EVERY DAY.

13:13.292 --> 13:16.212
- MAYBE IT WAS A MISTAKE
TO GET THE OLD GANG TOGETHER.

13:16.295 --> 13:19.048
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE
THE GHOSTS FROM THE PAST.

13:19.131 --> 13:22.051
- THAT'S FROM YOUR POEM.
UH, "MIDNIGHT LANE."

13:22.134 --> 13:24.720
IT TOUCHED MY SOUL.

13:24.803 --> 13:27.264
- YOU KNOW WHAT POEM
TOUCHED MY SOUL?

13:27.348 --> 13:30.392
YOUR POEM, "SHADOW LIGHTS,"
IN <i> THE NEW YORKER.</i>

13:30.476 --> 13:32.853
I SAW THE SUN
AS A METAPHOR

13:32.937 --> 13:35.773
FOR ALL THE RADIANT BEAUTY
THAT'S JUST BEYOND OUR REACH.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.733
- TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST
WITH YOU,

13:37.816 --> 13:40.861
THE INSPIRATION IS
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.241
YOU CAN SEE THE RADIANCE.
DON'T YOU, JOY?

13:45.324 --> 13:46.575
- YES.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.910
BUT LIKE THE SUN, IT'S--

13:47.993 --> 13:50.454
IT'S BEST NOT TO LOOK
DIRECTLY AT IT.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.251
- MELANIE, YOU'RE
THE PEACEMAKER IN YOUR GROUP.

13:55.334 --> 13:58.087
WHAT CAN I DO
TO MAKE THE OTHERS GET ALONG?

13:58.170 --> 13:59.922
- MAMIE SUE, I'M--
I'M KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE

14:00.005 --> 14:01.715
OF A DATE RIGHT NOW.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.301
- OH, I'M SORRY.
I'M BEING RUDE.

14:04.385 --> 14:07.096
I'M MAMIE SUE JOHNSON.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.764
- DR. REX SWANSON.

14:08.847 --> 14:10.724
- DOCTOR?
WHAT'S YOUR SPECIALTY?

14:10.808 --> 14:12.601
- I'M A PLASTIC SURGEON.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.896
- OH, MELANIE,
YOU MUST BE SO EXCITED!

14:18.023 --> 14:21.944
A PLASTIC SURGEON
IS HER NUMBER ONE DREAM DATE.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.113
- NO. WHAT?
[laughs]

14:24.196 --> 14:25.781
DON'T BE SILLY,
MAMIE SUE.

14:25.864 --> 14:27.449
DR. SWANSON
IS JUST MY DATE.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.119
I HAVE NO INTEREST
IN ANY NEW PROCEDURES

14:30.202 --> 14:33.122
OR FILLERS OR CUTTING-EDGE
SCULPTING AND LIFTING TECHNIQUES

14:33.205 --> 14:34.957
THAT COULD MAKE ME LOOK
FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS YOUNGER

14:35.040 --> 14:37.626
WITH MINIMUM
RECOVERY TIME.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.336
- MELANIE,
YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.754
I WOULDN'T
CHANGE A THING.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.923
- OH, YOU'RE VERY SWEET.
[chuckles]

14:43.007 --> 14:44.133
YEAH,
BUT JUST FOR FUN,

14:44.216 --> 14:46.468
IF I WAS TO COME IN
FOR A CONSULTATION,

14:46.552 --> 14:47.928
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU MIGHT MAKE

14:48.012 --> 14:50.764
JUST A LITTLE
TEENSY BIT BETTER?

14:55.519 --> 14:57.980
I'M A MONSTER!

14:58.063 --> 15:01.317
HE MARKED THINGS
I NEVER EVEN NOTICED!

15:01.400 --> 15:03.319
- DON'T LET
THAT DOCTOR SEE JOY.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.821
HE'LL RUN OUT OF INK.

15:05.904 --> 15:08.324
- OH, THERE'S
THAT BEAUTIFUL SOUL

15:08.407 --> 15:11.452
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.203
- JOY, HE'S STILL A GUY.

15:13.287 --> 15:16.165
HIKE UP YOUR SKIRT AND SHOW HIM
HOW PROFOUND YOU ARE.

15:17.916 --> 15:19.084
- WHAT ARE YOU ALL
DOING HERE?

15:19.168 --> 15:23.339
- THIS IS WHERE WE HANG OUT
WHEN OUR BIRTHDATES ARE TANKING.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.799
- WELL, I CAME
TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.801
I DON'T WANT US
TO FIGHT.

15:27.885 --> 15:30.012
- I DON'T WANT US
TO FIGHT EITHER.

15:30.095 --> 15:33.974
I'M SORRY I SAID ALL THOSE
AWFUL THINGS ABOUT YOU.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.142
- BUT YOU DIDN'T.

15:35.225 --> 15:39.521
- CHECK YOUR FACEBOOK PAGE.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.857
- COME ON, CHICKENS,
IT'S WINE TIME!

15:41.940 --> 15:43.192
- ELKA AND I MADE UP.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.568
- OH, PLEASE,
WHO EVEN REMEMBERS

15:44.652 --> 15:45.694
WHAT WE FOUGHT ABOUT?

15:45.778 --> 15:46.695
- THAT'S A GOOD ATTITUDE.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.531
- NO, I HONESTLY
DON'T REMEMBER.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.868
- SO WE'RE ALL FRIENDS,

15:52.951 --> 15:55.829
BUT DO YOU THINK
DIANE AND ANGIE EVER WILL BE?

15:55.913 --> 16:00.209
- HOW ABOUT WE GO
DRINK THAT WINE AND FIND OUT?

16:00.292 --> 16:02.044
[chuckles]

16:02.127 --> 16:04.588
- PLASTIC SURGEON?

16:04.672 --> 16:05.839
- YEP.

16:05.923 --> 16:10.511
- I HAD MY BOOBS DONE
LAST YEAR.

16:10.594 --> 16:13.389
NO, I DIDN'T.

16:17.643 --> 16:20.771
- SO.
- SO.

16:20.854 --> 16:23.148
- [scoffs]
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

16:23.232 --> 16:26.235
WE BOTH KNOW THE REAL REASON
THE TEAM BROKE UP.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.028
- YES, WE DO.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.905
- I SHOWED UP TONIGHT

16:29.988 --> 16:33.409
HOPING THAT WE COULD LET
BYGONES BE BYGONES.

16:33.492 --> 16:36.662
ALSO HOPING
THAT YOU HAD GOTTEN FAT.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.709
- WELL, I DIDN'T GET FAT.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.877
AND I DIDN'T DO
A LOT OF THE THINGS

16:43.961 --> 16:45.421
THAT YOU BLAME ME FOR.

16:45.504 --> 16:48.090
- YOU STOLE
MY BOYFRIEND, DIANE.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.591
- HE CHASED ME.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.803
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO LET HIM CATCH YOU.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.638
YOU TWO STILL MARRIED?

16:54.722 --> 16:56.473
- NO.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.767
HE WAS A PUTZ.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.563
- HEY, I TAUGHT YOU THAT WORD.
- YES, YOU DID.

17:02.646 --> 17:05.441
- YOU KNOW,
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

17:05.523 --> 17:07.776
HE WAS A PUTZ.

17:07.859 --> 17:09.611
- MM-HMM.
- OH.

17:09.694 --> 17:12.156
YOU MAY HAVE
DONE ME A FAVOR.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.324
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

17:14.407 --> 17:16.242
AND I'M SORRY.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.369
- OH, NO.
- OH.

17:27.463 --> 17:30.924
- MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
ALL THE TENSION WAS ABOUT.

17:37.848 --> 17:40.893
- WOW, THAT DRESS IS AS SHORT
AS A HAIKU NOW.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.813
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.982
- OH, DO YOU?

17:47.066 --> 17:48.317
- YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,

17:48.400 --> 17:50.652
BUT I DON'T VALUE
OUTWARD BEAUTY MUCH.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.155
PERHAPS THAT'S
BECAUSE I'M...

17:53.238 --> 17:56.658
SO BEAUTIFUL MYSELF.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.535
- I GIVE UP.

17:58.619 --> 17:59.828
- WELL, IT DOESN'T MEAN
I WOULDN'T TOSS YOU A BONE

17:59.912 --> 18:01.914
AND SLEEP WITH YOU.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.500
- I OUGHT TO SLAP YOU.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.419
- IF ONLY ELKA
WERE SAYING THOSE WORDS.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.633
- OH, REX,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:12.716 --> 18:15.552
YOU'VE BEEN
VERY SWEET,

18:15.636 --> 18:17.805
BUT ALL I KEEP THINKING ABOUT
IS ALL THE FLAWS

18:17.888 --> 18:19.681
THAT YOU'RE SEEING.

18:19.765 --> 18:23.185
YOU KNOW WHAT, I JUST DON'T
THINK THIS IS GONNA WORK.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.521
- OH, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.147
NOW THAT YOU'VE TURNED ON
THE DOCTOR SWITCH,

18:27.231 --> 18:28.690
ALL I CAN SEE ARE
THE 12 OBVIOUS WAYS

18:28.774 --> 18:32.736
YOU CAN BE IMPROVED.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.155
- Y--YOU ONLY
MARKED TEN.

18:35.239 --> 18:39.117
- THAT'S WHEN I THOUGHT
WE WERE STILL ON A DATE.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.869
- HOW DARE YOU?

18:40.953 --> 18:45.207
YOU KNOW, BUT DO
LEAVE YOUR CARD.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.377
- AND DID YOU RECOGNIZE
WHICH SCENE WAS MY HOMAGE

18:48.460 --> 18:50.379
TO EISENSTEIN'S <i> POTEMKIN?</i>

18:50.462 --> 18:52.923
- LOOK, I--
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

18:53.006 --> 18:56.552
I HAVEN'T UNDERSTOOD ONE WORD
YOU'VE SAID ALL NIGHT.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.720
I DON'T KNOW
JAPANESE DIRECTORS.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.390
I'M NOT INTROSPECTIVE
OR ESOTERIC,

19:01.473 --> 19:03.725
BUT I CAN DO THIS PART.
I SWEAR I CAN.

19:03.809 --> 19:07.145
- FINALLY, THAT'S THE HONESTY
I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.439
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT THE CHARACTER NEEDS.

19:09.523 --> 19:12.943
SHOW ME MORE
OF THAT HONESTY.

19:13.026 --> 19:15.279
DEEPER, DARKER.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.406
HURT ME WITH IT.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.241
- I'M SELFISH.
- YES.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.743
- AND I'M VAIN.
- YES.

19:21.827 --> 19:25.330
- AND I'M REALLY FREAKED OUT
BY YOUR WEBBED HANDS.

19:26.331 --> 19:29.376
- WELL, THAT'S JUST MEAN.

19:29.459 --> 19:32.337
[deep pop]

19:37.676 --> 19:39.428
- LOOK, I'M REALLY,
REALLY SORRY.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.762
BUT YOU SAID
TO HURT YOU.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.140
TELL ME HOW
I CAN MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

19:43.223 --> 19:44.725
- GET ME A JOB
DIRECTING A TV SHOW.

19:44.808 --> 19:46.101
- WHAT?
- THERE'S NO MONEY

19:46.184 --> 19:47.561
IN INDEPENDENT FILMS.
LAST NIGHT'S DINNER

19:47.644 --> 19:48.979
WAS A SLIM JIM
AND A CIGARETTE.

19:49.062 --> 19:52.357
YOU GOT THIS, RIGHT?

19:55.861 --> 19:58.572
- DID I SAY STOP?

20:02.201 --> 20:03.619
- NO MORE FIGHTING?

20:03.702 --> 20:06.955
- YES, THE PAST IS THE PAST.
RIGHT, KID?

20:07.039 --> 20:09.124
- YOU BETCHA.

20:09.207 --> 20:11.460
- WE'RE ALL GONNA
TALK NICE TO EACH OTHER.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.295
[light laughter]

20:18.550 --> 20:21.470
- SO UM,
DO YOU HAVE GRANDKIDS?

20:21.553 --> 20:23.972
- EIGHT.
ALMOST ALL GROWN.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.974
- OH, ISN'T THAT NICE?

20:26.058 --> 20:29.019
- IT REALLY IS.

20:32.022 --> 20:34.775
IT REALLY IS.

20:34.858 --> 20:37.194
- NO, IT ISN'T.
IT'S BORING.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.529
THIS ISN'T US.
- SHE'S RIGHT.

20:39.613 --> 20:42.115
WE DIDN'T COME HERE
FOR OLD LADY CHITCHAT.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.284
WE CAME HERE
BECAUSE WE'RE CHAMPIONS.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.285
[laughter]

20:45.369 --> 20:46.828
- WE WERE PRETTY GOOD.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.372
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

20:48.455 --> 20:50.290
WE WERE THE BEST
THERE EVER WAS.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.501
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- A CLASSIC.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.170
- EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT,
ALL EYES WERE ON US.

20:55.253 --> 20:57.839
- THAT'S TRUE.
THEY EVEN LIKED THIS ONE.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.841
- WELL, I HAD SEX APPEAL.

20:59.925 --> 21:03.136
IN FACT, UH,
I STILL DO.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.309
- REALLY?
WHERE DO YOU KEEP IT?

21:09.393 --> 21:12.020
THE BASEMENT?

21:12.104 --> 21:13.021
- MAN.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.774
- NOW, THIS IS US.

21:18.443 --> 21:19.528
- YEAH,
WE HAD OUR DIFFERENCES,

21:19.611 --> 21:22.030
BUT WE WENT OUT
ON TOP.

21:22.114 --> 21:25.701
- YEAH,
JUST LIKE MY HUSBAND.

21:29.413 --> 21:32.499
- AT LEAST HE DIED
DOING SOMETHING HE LOVED.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.336
- THAT'S RIGHT--
CHEATING ON ME.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.383
[overlapping chatter]
