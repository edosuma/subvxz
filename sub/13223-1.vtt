00:52.317 --> 00:55.588
If you're ever tucked
inside Laurel Canyon,

00:55.620 --> 00:58.190
this is the street
my two sisters used to live on.

01:07.466 --> 01:09.702
If you listen carefully,

01:09.734 --> 01:14.340
you can almost always hear
a distant howling.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.568
My name is Emily.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.670
And I was born
without a heartbeat.

01:45.704 --> 01:48.140
I'd have been
the middle sister.

01:48.174 --> 01:52.711
Right between Elle,
the oldest,

01:52.744 --> 01:55.247
and Joy,
the youngest.

01:59.085 --> 02:03.156
The three of us
would have lived on Weepah Way.

02:03.189 --> 02:05.258
This would have been
our neighborhood.

02:06.692 --> 02:10.729
We would have been
three wild animals.

02:12.044 --> 02:15.044
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

02:20.307 --> 02:23.307
<b>WEEPAH WAY FOR NOW</b>

02:23.308 --> 02:25.777
I'm here to show you
the last week my sisters spent

02:25.811 --> 02:27.080
on Weepah Way.

02:28.180 --> 02:29.549
At the time,

02:29.581 --> 02:31.483
Elle and Joy
were eight months removed

02:31.516 --> 02:33.686
from moving in
to Laurel Canyon,

02:33.718 --> 02:37.622
an historic neighborhood
between sunset and ventura.

02:37.656 --> 02:40.826
Two years removed from moving
out of the family house

02:40.860 --> 02:43.830
and in with our
newly divorced mother.

02:43.862 --> 02:47.432
Three years from discovering
our father was cheating.

02:47.466 --> 02:51.671
Four years removed from starting
anti-anxiety medication.

02:51.704 --> 02:53.672
And eight years
since releasing

02:53.706 --> 02:57.143
their last album
as recording artists.

02:57.176 --> 03:00.780
Shit.

03:00.813 --> 03:02.348
-Okay.
-God.

03:02.380 --> 03:04.683
-Different bowl.
-What the shit?

03:04.717 --> 03:06.252
Shit.
I think it's on fire.

03:06.284 --> 03:08.121
Let me tell you
about them.

03:08.153 --> 03:10.555
Elle liked making budgets,
but never kept them.

03:10.588 --> 03:12.592
She loved knowing
what job paid

03:12.624 --> 03:15.393
for every item
in her life.

03:15.426 --> 03:17.729
Joy would report
Elle's spending to our mother.

03:17.762 --> 03:19.831
The separation
from our parents

03:19.865 --> 03:23.603
didn't trigger any addictions
or odd behavior.

03:23.635 --> 03:25.805
There was
no real acting out.

03:25.837 --> 03:28.840
Although the trauma
might have accentuated

03:28.873 --> 03:31.309
the habits
my sisters already had.

03:31.343 --> 03:33.746
This is my father, John.

03:33.778 --> 03:35.347
This is my mother, Lynn.

03:35.380 --> 03:38.550
On the rare occasions
Elle and Joy saw him,

03:38.583 --> 03:41.287
they invariably went out
sailing on the canals

03:41.319 --> 03:43.288
around his new
bachelor's retreat.

03:43.321 --> 03:45.790
Mom claimed to enjoy
her freedom.

03:45.824 --> 03:50.463
Especially her freedom to stop as
frequently as she wanted on car trips.

03:50.496 --> 03:52.265
Joy, my younger sister,

03:52.297 --> 03:55.500
was the last to let go
of the image of our father

03:55.533 --> 03:58.170
as a great man.

03:58.204 --> 03:59.171
Look at this one.

04:00.906 --> 04:03.710
All of the ties to their
youth were slipping away.

04:11.550 --> 04:14.520
This is Elle
at 24.

04:14.552 --> 04:17.322
This is Joy
at 22.

04:17.356 --> 04:19.791
This is the house
my mom shared with cowboy Lou,

04:19.825 --> 04:21.827
her boyfriend of two weeks

04:21.858 --> 04:24.396
who owned a winery
in Paso Robles.

04:24.429 --> 04:27.465
She moved in with him
only days after discovering

04:27.498 --> 04:31.469
she had two years before
her savings would run out.

04:31.503 --> 04:34.774
Elle and Joy, tucked into the
hillside of Laurel Canyon

04:34.806 --> 04:38.577
believed it would all
come together.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.480
All of it for the good.

04:43.616 --> 04:46.419
Elle, roadie threw up all over
herself on her Gandalf beard.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.221
And it's dripping.

04:48.253 --> 04:50.823
Here, stay in the shower.
Stay there, stay there. Stay!

04:50.856 --> 04:54.226
Welcome to a typical morning
with my sisters.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.796
What the fuck?
Were you just touching that?

04:56.828 --> 04:58.730
You're vile,
why is that out?

04:58.763 --> 05:00.633
-Why are you in here?
-I'm in here because I don't wanna

05:00.666 --> 05:02.702
drain roadie's vomit beard
in my shower.

05:02.734 --> 05:05.003
-That's nice.
-You okay, honey?

05:05.037 --> 05:06.871
I'm sorry you had
to go through that.

05:06.904 --> 05:08.440
You're disgusting, you should
be ashamed of yourself.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.243
Mom warned me about this.

05:10.275 --> 05:11.643
That it would be really hard
living together,

05:11.676 --> 05:13.979
because I do all the work
around here

05:14.012 --> 05:16.282
-while you sit here vibrating.
-She said that? That's interesting.

05:16.315 --> 05:16.912
'Cause she said the
same thing about you.

05:16.913 --> 05:17.211
Are you kidding me?

05:17.212 --> 05:18.340
Why are you here?

05:18.341 --> 05:20.386
I do so much and mom knows
I don't use a vibrator

05:20.419 --> 05:22.955
-to distract me from everyday living.
-Great.

05:22.988 --> 05:24.824
Don't use one
in the bath either,

05:24.856 --> 05:26.291
you'll get electrocuted.
Don't even look at that.

05:26.325 --> 05:28.294
Electrocuted?
It's battery operated.

05:28.327 --> 05:29.895
And by the way,
that was not me.

05:29.928 --> 05:31.797
No, that was some weird noise
in the house. Good night.

05:31.830 --> 05:33.866
I really don't think
we should have the party here.

05:33.899 --> 05:35.701
I think everything we've been doing
right now is destined to fail.

05:35.734 --> 05:37.335
No, no, no. We are having
a party here. Stop.

05:37.368 --> 05:38.503
I don't think
anyone is gonna show.

05:38.537 --> 05:39.938
And last year
for Halloween,

05:39.972 --> 05:42.275
we ordered 15 pumpkins
and carving stations,

05:42.308 --> 05:44.777
and how many people came?
Just tell me.

05:44.810 --> 05:46.379
Remind me, for fun.

05:46.412 --> 05:48.481
Two. Hard to forget,
isn't it?

05:48.513 --> 05:50.315
It doesn't matter, okay?
People are gonna show up.

05:50.349 --> 05:52.618
They have to.
We're leaving the country.

05:52.650 --> 05:54.185
They're gonna be asshole
friends if they don't.

05:54.186 --> 05:54.953
They are asshole friends.

05:54.986 --> 05:56.421
Half of them are musicians or
actors. They're not gonna show up.

05:56.455 --> 05:58.791
By the way,
when does terminix come?

05:58.823 --> 06:01.760
8:00-12:00. Fuckers never
give an exact time,

06:01.794 --> 06:03.395
so the guy's window
is huge.

06:03.428 --> 06:05.530
Who says 8:00-12:00?

06:05.563 --> 06:07.499
That's like me saying "I'll show up
to an audition from 8:00-12:00."

06:07.532 --> 06:09.701
What time are we expecting her?
I don't know, 8:00-12:00.

06:09.734 --> 06:11.469
Could be 9:30...
Could be 10:15...

06:11.503 --> 06:13.606
Could be 11:52...
Could be past 12:00.

06:13.638 --> 06:14.606
Then that's
really fucked.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.342
Yeah, no shit.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.511
You gotta get up at 8:00
in case they come at 8:00.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.846
Then you have to live your life staying
here just to wait for the Rat Man.

06:20.878 --> 06:22.614
Shit.
Well, it's better that

06:22.647 --> 06:24.082
than it comes out
during the party.

06:24.116 --> 06:26.919
It's like...

06:28.620 --> 06:30.556
It still smells like
something died in here.

06:30.589 --> 06:32.558
It on...
Every time I walk in.

06:32.590 --> 06:34.392
My thing
that I'm worried about

06:34.426 --> 06:35.895
is that this house isn't going
to look good for our party.

06:35.928 --> 06:38.331
'Cause when dad shows up
I don't want him doubting us.

06:38.363 --> 06:40.543
I don't want him saying,
"There's Rats..."

06:40.544 --> 06:41.633
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

06:41.666 --> 06:44.102
"When dad comes?"

06:44.135 --> 06:46.438
-I might've invited him.
-You told our father

06:46.472 --> 06:48.573
-to come to our going away party?
-Yeah, 'cause he's our dad.

06:48.606 --> 06:50.342
-That's so nice.
-He's blood, you know?

06:50.375 --> 06:52.544
Thanks...
You fucked up.

06:52.577 --> 06:53.177
Why?

06:53.178 --> 06:54.979
You fucking invited him,
when you shouldn't have.

06:55.012 --> 06:56.715
And I know why you did it.

06:56.748 --> 06:58.049
Because in your little,
weird, strange, obsessive mind,

06:58.082 --> 06:59.719
you're sitting there
in your room

06:59.751 --> 07:01.453
and your mind is racing,
your heart is beating fast.

07:01.486 --> 07:03.054
-You're like...
-You know what? He's blood.

07:03.087 --> 07:05.457
And we need to just fucking
stop pussying out about dad

07:05.491 --> 07:06.959
and getting scared about what
he's gonna do at a party.

07:06.991 --> 07:08.426
Admit that you fucked up.
And I will let it go.

07:08.460 --> 07:09.762
Just say,
"you know what, Elle?

07:09.794 --> 07:10.962
You're right.
I did something wrong.

07:10.996 --> 07:12.464
It's my issue."

07:12.498 --> 07:14.400
Admit it right now,
you fucked up.

07:17.169 --> 07:19.404
Was that just you?

07:19.438 --> 07:21.574
Was that the smell of you?
Your life? Your being?

07:21.606 --> 07:23.943
-Yes.
-It smells like an aquarium.

07:23.976 --> 07:27.146
-Yeah, it smells nice...
-It smells like a fucking fish tank.

07:27.178 --> 07:29.414
That is rude. And by the way,
who cares about my little...

07:29.448 --> 07:31.750
-you made her pant harder.
-Who cares if I'm a little stinky.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.118
That's disgusting.

07:33.152 --> 07:34.919
You think my problems
of o. C.D. Are a problem.

07:34.952 --> 07:36.522
You need
to fucking bathe.

07:36.554 --> 07:38.556
I'm sorry, I sweat
like a normal human being.

07:40.159 --> 07:41.926
-Do you wash?
-Shut up.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.496
-Yes I do.
-Do you clean?

07:43.529 --> 07:45.831
Really?
Are you asking that question?

07:45.863 --> 07:48.566
Yeah, I am, because your
sister is very clean.

07:48.599 --> 07:50.736
Clean skin, clean nails.
Clean face.

07:50.769 --> 07:52.071
I... my vagina
is always clean.

07:52.104 --> 07:54.005
-My breath never smells.
-Your vagina never...

07:54.039 --> 07:55.215
how do you know that
your vagina never smells?

07:55.216 --> 07:55.608
I got a physical.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.609
-No, I don't go down and smell.
-Yep, mom!

07:57.642 --> 07:59.445
-Vagina's clean. What?
-My nails are clean and always done.

07:59.477 --> 08:00.812
My skin is clean.

08:00.846 --> 08:02.681
I wash my feet
so they don't smell.

08:02.714 --> 08:05.084
I don't sweat that much
because I have the ac on.

08:05.116 --> 08:06.818
I think about these things.

08:06.851 --> 08:09.020
Okay, let me fucking text
all of your ex-boyfriends

08:09.053 --> 08:10.455
and ask if your vagina never smelled
the entire time you were with them.

08:10.488 --> 08:11.856
Sure, they'll all have
the same answer.

08:11.890 --> 08:13.692
Every once in a while
you'll have a bad day

08:13.724 --> 08:15.660
because you're on your period
and it gets a little stinky.

08:15.693 --> 08:17.462
All right, put the female stuff
aside. Clean, all the time.

08:17.496 --> 08:18.563
Yeah, well, at least
I didn't lose my virginity

08:18.597 --> 08:21.099
to a 33-year-old
fucking creep.

08:21.133 --> 08:23.101
Yeah, that's right.
He was 33.

08:23.135 --> 08:24.537
That's Christ's age. Okay?

08:24.570 --> 08:25.538
That's a powerful age
right there

08:25.570 --> 08:26.905
to lose your virginity.

08:26.938 --> 08:28.140
"Powerful age to lose
your virginity to?"

08:28.173 --> 08:30.476
Are you shitting me
right now?

08:30.508 --> 08:32.034
That's a very important
age in the biblical times.

08:32.035 --> 08:32.544
Is it?

08:32.577 --> 08:34.179
So Christ was just 33 the entire
time he was in the Bible?

08:34.212 --> 08:35.813
-I didn't know he was frozen in time.
-Not saying that.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.817
Most famous age was 33.
Crucifixion.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.485
Okay.
Crucifixion.

08:39.518 --> 08:40.919
In my mind
I feel like maybe

08:40.952 --> 08:43.020
when he was a baby
that was a pretty big deal.

08:43.054 --> 08:45.056
When he was like, in a manger
in swaddling clothes

08:45.090 --> 08:46.525
and Mary gave birth to him.
I think that was a big deal.

08:46.558 --> 08:48.626
Most famous age
would be crucifixion.

08:48.659 --> 08:50.829
-Anyone would tell you that, 33.
-Really? Is that right? Is that right?

08:50.862 --> 08:53.097
-Is it, is it really that age?
-Yeah, it was 33.

08:53.130 --> 08:54.766
Interesting.

08:54.799 --> 08:56.168
Because I would say
that if the wise men were here,

08:56.201 --> 08:57.770
they would probably agree
with me and say...

08:57.803 --> 08:59.038
Would you talk
to the wise men like that,

08:59.071 --> 09:00.806
with that
"valley girl" accent?

09:00.838 --> 09:03.508
Yo, wise men, what was
the most famous age of Christ?

09:03.542 --> 09:06.612
They would say, 100 percent
that it was when he was a baby.

09:06.645 --> 09:09.048
-No, no, no. Get her.
-No, no, no.

09:09.081 --> 09:10.883
No, no, she's fine.

09:10.915 --> 09:12.684
I don't feel good
about what's been going on.

09:12.717 --> 09:14.118
I'm... I'm fucking upset.

09:14.151 --> 09:16.254
Because we keep getting
bad rejection.

09:16.288 --> 09:17.388
And I feel like how
roadie looks right now.

09:17.389 --> 09:17.755
Really?

09:17.789 --> 09:19.690
What... yeah.
With barf on your face?

09:19.691 --> 09:20.745
-Yes.
-Yeah, that's how I feel too.

09:20.746 --> 09:22.895
I feel like we're just standing
there with barf and shit on our face,

09:22.928 --> 09:24.663
like,
"here's our record."

09:24.696 --> 09:27.066
These small comedies,
they don't work.

09:27.098 --> 09:29.834
Just last week, I saw a few
that my clients were in.

09:29.867 --> 09:31.503
I wanted
to poke my eyes out.

09:31.536 --> 09:33.738
And now you want to make
a small, independent comedy,

09:33.771 --> 09:35.940
heartfelt or not,
nobody's gonna see it.

09:35.973 --> 09:38.643
Hello, down there.

09:40.111 --> 09:42.146
Everyone's so little
from up here, aren't they?

09:42.179 --> 09:43.616
Look at that lady.

09:43.649 --> 09:45.583
She doesn't know
what's going on up here.

09:45.616 --> 09:47.719
She doesn't know what's going on
up here in this office, does she?

09:47.752 --> 09:49.153
It's crazy, right?

09:49.187 --> 09:50.722
We're just up here
doing whatever we're doing,

09:50.755 --> 09:52.558
and she's down there
walking her fucking kid.

09:52.591 --> 09:54.092
What were we
talking about?

09:54.125 --> 09:56.261
I really love
that you guys want to produce.

09:56.294 --> 09:59.698
It's one of the reasons I was
interested in representing you.

09:59.731 --> 10:00.832
This is not the one.

10:00.866 --> 10:02.635
Let's put it on the table.

10:02.668 --> 10:04.904
Let's focus on the things
that are working for you.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.972
Would the indie financing department
be willing to take a look?

10:07.005 --> 10:08.807
That's kinda
why we're here.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.576
Can I ask you one more question
before we change the subject?

10:10.608 --> 10:12.277
Yeah.

10:12.310 --> 10:14.913
Can we talk
about the tour?

10:14.947 --> 10:16.948
-Yeah.
-The tour...

10:16.981 --> 10:18.550
Not a good idea.

10:18.583 --> 10:20.285
Why did you change
your hair color?

10:20.318 --> 10:21.553
How did that happen?

10:21.587 --> 10:22.788
I mean,
this is for a role.

10:22.821 --> 10:24.957
So it's been like this
for like a year.

10:24.990 --> 10:27.092
-Like a role in a movie?
-In a film.

10:27.125 --> 10:29.562
-Yeah, yeah.
-Like a studio pic?

10:29.595 --> 10:31.446
No, no. This really great
little independent I did.

10:31.447 --> 10:32.064
Fuck it.

10:32.097 --> 10:33.966
Fuck that shit.

10:33.999 --> 10:36.869
God damn it,
I need to pee.

10:36.901 --> 10:38.803
I always wondered
if I could jump

10:38.837 --> 10:41.640
from the top of this building
to the top of that building.

10:41.673 --> 10:43.676
I think
I could make it.

10:43.708 --> 10:46.111
I think I could make it.

10:46.144 --> 10:48.780
Do like some parkour shit
down the side of the building

10:48.813 --> 10:50.049
if I miss...
Only if I miss.

10:50.082 --> 10:51.817
In the case
that I did miss,

10:51.850 --> 10:53.919
but I think I could just...
Clear shot right over there.

10:53.952 --> 10:56.621
Anyway, when can you change
your hair back?

10:56.654 --> 10:59.024
Actually, first of all,
we're going to Turkey

10:59.057 --> 11:00.960
is our first leg of the tour...

11:00.992 --> 11:02.226
-We're going to Europe.
-Turkey...

11:02.260 --> 11:05.197
Yeah, and then I also really...

11:05.230 --> 11:07.366
Everybody in Turkey's poor.

11:07.399 --> 11:09.635
There's no money there.
Go to Dubai.

11:09.668 --> 11:12.938
So close. It's just... the
production sounds a little like a...

11:16.375 --> 11:18.077
Dumbed...
Dumbed down.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.379
It was...
It feels dumbed down.

11:20.411 --> 11:22.080
That's hard to say,
"dumbed down."

11:22.114 --> 11:23.148
Try that.

11:23.180 --> 11:26.150
"Dumbed down."

11:26.183 --> 11:28.153
Dumbed down.

11:28.185 --> 11:28.930
Yeah, but see, you're
missing the second "d."

11:28.931 --> 11:29.981
Say, "dumbed down."

11:29.982 --> 11:31.531
-It's weird, it sounds...
-"Dumbed down."

11:31.532 --> 11:33.092
I don't think...
Don't say it.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.094
"Dumbed down. You guys
dumbed her down."

11:35.126 --> 11:36.728
By the way, it's freezing in
here. Please turn the air off.

11:36.761 --> 11:38.664
Look at me,
I'm fucking dripping.

11:38.697 --> 11:40.399
You're gross.
You're like a miniature mom.

11:40.432 --> 11:42.000
-I'm really hot.
-You're menopausing at 22 like her.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.702
It would help you.

11:43.735 --> 11:45.704
You wouldn't wake up
in a bath of aquarium water

11:45.736 --> 11:48.272
if you actually turned on the AC
and helped yourself.

11:48.305 --> 11:50.074
You know what? I'm gonna
have a house when I'm older.

11:50.107 --> 11:52.645
When I'm an adult,
when I'm like a grown human,

11:52.678 --> 11:55.713
I'm gonna have my children, that are
gonna be fucking adorable and hot.

11:55.746 --> 11:59.885
-And guess what?
-Okay. Depends on who you marry.

11:59.918 --> 12:01.120
We're not gonna
have any AC ever.

12:01.153 --> 12:02.254
-Ever?
-No AC. Nope.

12:02.286 --> 12:03.821
-Just fans.
-You live in California.

12:03.855 --> 12:05.658
You can't come over
with mom

12:05.691 --> 12:07.026
and turn the air conditioning
on, 'cause there isn't one.

12:07.058 --> 12:08.193
That's fine.
I don't wanna be invited over.

12:08.226 --> 12:09.395
Good, yeah, well,
guess what...

12:09.428 --> 12:11.230
You're just really
a mean person.

12:11.263 --> 12:13.365
-You don't care about your family.
-Unlike you, unlike you,

12:13.398 --> 12:15.868
I can be by myself and not have a
panic attack in my own bed, like...

12:16.899 --> 12:19.737
Really? We're gonna fucking talk
and joke about my panic attacks?

12:19.770 --> 12:21.240
I'm a creative being.

12:21.273 --> 12:23.375
I suffer with anxiety and OCD.

12:23.408 --> 12:26.010
Just like people
like Beethoven and Mozart.

12:26.044 --> 12:28.179
Those people had
the same fucking issues.

12:28.212 --> 12:29.847
And they ended up
killing themselves because of...

12:29.880 --> 12:31.049
So now you're wishing
that you're dead.

12:31.082 --> 12:32.818
That's first of all,
really dark.

12:32.851 --> 12:35.220
-Bye. Let's go there. I'm dead.
-Really bad. You're dead?

12:35.252 --> 12:36.493
Okay, good night.
Good bye. Bye. I miss you.

12:36.494 --> 12:37.321
Good night. Bye. I just died.

12:37.355 --> 12:40.192
-I'll miss you. I'll think of you.
-Bye. I died of natural causes.

12:40.225 --> 12:42.127
Okay. I don't know why you're still
talking because you're dead, right?

12:42.159 --> 12:44.429
And you're gonna be
a terrible mother, very selfish.

12:44.462 --> 12:46.164
-Go text mom about it.
-Maybe I will. You know what?

12:46.198 --> 12:48.033
Mom, I ate a tuna
fish sandwich today.

12:48.066 --> 12:50.235
Mom, I had steak for dinner.
Mom, I wiped my butt.

12:50.268 --> 12:52.204
-I already left the room.
-Mom, I brushed my teeth.

12:52.236 --> 12:53.771
I already left the room.
Your words can't hurt me.

12:53.804 --> 12:54.972
I... mom,
I changed my underwear.

12:55.005 --> 12:56.408
Should I change
my underwear again,

12:56.441 --> 12:58.310
'cause I think there
was some ovulation in it.

12:58.342 --> 13:01.380
-I'm gonna change it a third time.
-Okay... okay...

13:01.413 --> 13:03.948
Come on. We both
went a little too far.

13:03.981 --> 13:06.117
Look at me.

13:06.150 --> 13:08.286
Look me in the eye.

13:09.954 --> 13:11.389
You were rude and rude.

13:11.423 --> 13:13.158
You were rude.

13:13.191 --> 13:14.359
We need to treat
each other with respect,

13:14.391 --> 13:15.760
we're all we got.

13:15.794 --> 13:17.929
Who is it?

13:17.962 --> 13:19.164
My gyno.

13:19.197 --> 13:22.366
Hello?

13:22.400 --> 13:23.935
Yes.

13:23.968 --> 13:24.969
Don't forget to wash roadie.

13:25.002 --> 13:29.073
I know. Go.

13:29.106 --> 13:30.909
Hey, Claudia.

13:30.942 --> 13:34.145
Yeah.

13:41.153 --> 13:42.888
Okay, but is this actually
a serious thing?

13:42.920 --> 13:44.188
'Cause last time
that I came over,

13:44.222 --> 13:47.458
you guys lost
my pee sample.

13:47.491 --> 13:49.361
Hey, Joy?

13:49.394 --> 13:52.898
When's the last time
I had sex?

14:04.042 --> 14:06.044
My son is my only one.

14:06.077 --> 14:07.946
Claudia had cleaned
our family house

14:07.978 --> 14:09.280
for more than a decade.

14:09.313 --> 14:11.884
We'd been there
for the senseless deaths

14:11.917 --> 14:14.119
of three of her family members.

14:14.151 --> 14:17.054
She couldn't leave the country
for any of their funerals.

14:17.087 --> 14:19.491
She told my sisters
about mom's drinking.

14:19.524 --> 14:22.461
But before anyone intervened,

14:22.494 --> 14:28.967
mom moved in with cowboy Lou and
no one ever brought it up again.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.870
And then he
looking at me like...

14:31.903 --> 14:35.174
Very bad...
Very mad to me.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.375
He say,
"I don't want it, this kid."

14:37.409 --> 14:40.813
I said, "you don't want it,
but I want my son."

14:40.846 --> 14:44.216
You no want to be with us,
the door is open.

14:44.249 --> 14:46.018
-You're out.
-Yeah.

14:46.050 --> 14:48.286
-Lot of women, single mom.
-True.

14:48.319 --> 14:50.988
He don't want my son. He don't
want to give it the last name.

14:51.021 --> 14:54.358
I say, "no problem. My son
is gonna have my last name."

14:54.391 --> 14:56.127
-No problem.
-What's the difference?

14:56.160 --> 14:58.830
You don't wanna give it?
Okay. Keep it.

14:58.864 --> 15:00.866
Anyway, when you die
you're gonna take it.

15:00.899 --> 15:01.900
Who's gonna need it.

15:02.967 --> 15:04.236
Yeah, what do you think?

15:04.269 --> 15:05.604
Well, should we put
one up there?

15:05.636 --> 15:08.005
No, no, no.
Because the bigger the cheese,

15:08.039 --> 15:11.342
the more of an aroma
it sends off

15:11.375 --> 15:13.111
and these rats
come sniffing.

15:13.144 --> 15:14.546
Yeah, I mean we do,

15:14.578 --> 15:17.049
let's kill 'em.
We wanna kill 'em.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.250
You do or you don't.

15:18.283 --> 15:22.353
I mean, I charge 120 to
extract a rat or a opossum...

15:22.386 --> 15:24.121
All right, yeah.
No, we're gonna do it.

15:24.154 --> 15:26.424
-You are?
-Yeah. I think we should, right?

15:26.457 --> 15:29.895
How about you give me
your number and I'll call you

15:29.928 --> 15:31.996
and then I'll
have your number.

15:32.029 --> 15:33.598
It's always worked
in the past.

15:33.631 --> 15:36.167
Don't fix it
if it's not broke.

15:36.201 --> 15:37.870
-Right, okay.
-Right, right.

15:37.903 --> 15:40.272
I don't have to worry
in case one of you are showering

15:40.304 --> 15:42.039
or busy trying stuff on.

15:42.073 --> 15:44.175
-You know what?
-That way we can always...

15:44.208 --> 15:45.611
Let's get
both of yours.

15:45.644 --> 15:48.380
-I'll do it. I'll do it.
-No, no, no.

15:48.413 --> 15:49.641
We're gonna put our mom's cell.

15:49.642 --> 15:51.383
I think... yeah, mom's
cell is the safest.

15:51.415 --> 15:53.284
You'll get a hold
of her easy. It's fine.

15:53.318 --> 15:57.054
She's a robust,
young, 39...4...

15:57.087 --> 15:58.557
What would you say,
early 40s?

15:58.590 --> 16:01.026
-No, she's in her 50s.
-Okay...

16:01.058 --> 16:02.437
Yeah, but she's healthy.
She's doing good.

16:02.438 --> 16:03.127
Yeah, she's great.

16:03.160 --> 16:05.097
-That could work, I could do that.
-She'll be the one...

16:05.130 --> 16:07.164
-Yeah, she'll let you know.
-She'll answer...

16:07.198 --> 16:08.500
Yeah, she'll answer
any questions...

16:08.533 --> 16:11.202
She's not...
Like tight around the waist?

16:11.236 --> 16:13.505
I'm good, I'm good.

16:13.538 --> 16:14.573
That's all I need.

16:14.606 --> 16:15.975
Got a couple visuals.

16:20.010 --> 16:22.079
That was interesting.

16:22.112 --> 16:23.314
There's a date
right there for me.

16:26.483 --> 16:28.419
What's mom doing?
Have you texted her yet?

16:28.452 --> 16:30.222
Pfft, no. I don't know
what she's doing today.

16:30.255 --> 16:32.957
I think she has
ballet class again.

16:32.991 --> 16:34.558
So you haven't
heard from her then?

16:34.592 --> 16:36.127
No.

16:36.160 --> 16:38.095
You did a a tic after that.

16:38.129 --> 16:40.332
Okay, well,
you have your own weird habits.

16:40.365 --> 16:42.100
I know I do, Elle.
I have to do it.

16:42.132 --> 16:43.668
-It makes me feel good.
-No, you don't have to do it.

16:43.702 --> 16:45.202
You can have self control.

16:45.236 --> 16:46.438
Well, we both do it.

16:46.471 --> 16:48.941
It's our OCD.
Can't help it.

16:48.973 --> 16:50.275
Okay, well,
your habits are getting worse.

16:50.308 --> 16:51.510
Just saying.

16:51.543 --> 16:53.512
Yours are.

16:53.544 --> 16:55.546
-You're taking long showers again.
-No, I'm not.

16:55.579 --> 16:57.515
Yes, you are.
Because mine are getting cold.

16:57.549 --> 17:00.084
And you're touching windows,
and doorknobs,

17:00.117 --> 17:01.252
and fucking curtains and shit.

17:01.285 --> 17:02.688
I don't do that any more.

17:02.721 --> 17:04.089
So you're telling me
that you don't touch walls

17:04.121 --> 17:06.290
or shampoo or conditioner.

17:06.323 --> 17:08.392
Maybe the shampoo and
conditioner bottles sometimes.

17:08.425 --> 17:10.162
Yeah.

17:10.194 --> 17:11.563
-You just did it again.
-Yeah, well, you made me nervous.

17:11.595 --> 17:13.265
Yeah, well,
that's too bad.

17:13.297 --> 17:15.499
At least I'm not touching
random shit like this.

17:15.532 --> 17:17.234
What, do you watch me
in the shower, you weirdo?

17:17.267 --> 17:19.003
I don't do it
like that either.

17:19.036 --> 17:20.137
I do it like this.

17:20.170 --> 17:21.707
Okay.
That makes sense.

17:21.739 --> 17:23.240
Not that you deserve to know.

17:26.343 --> 17:27.411
What?

17:27.444 --> 17:28.746
Dad texted us.

17:28.780 --> 17:30.182
What did he say?

17:30.215 --> 17:31.616
He wants to bring
Susan on friday.

17:31.649 --> 17:33.318
Well, hell no.

17:33.351 --> 17:35.486
This is exactly why we don't
invite him to things.

17:35.519 --> 17:37.455
-Think about mom.
-When mom meets her, she'll be nice.

17:37.488 --> 17:39.156
She's nice to everyone.

17:39.189 --> 17:40.158
Okay, still,
fuck no.

17:40.190 --> 17:42.526
I agree.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.329
Sorry, okay?
I know, I did it again.

17:44.361 --> 17:45.730
Fuck.

17:48.065 --> 17:49.266
Okay. Yes. I know.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.534
My gosh.

17:50.567 --> 17:52.336
Stop. It's a problem.

17:52.370 --> 17:53.371
Stop. Don't.

17:55.140 --> 18:00.012
Don't. You'll make me
do it the whole ride.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.183
Shit.
What did I start?

18:10.354 --> 18:12.490
We could just have mom do it.

18:12.524 --> 18:15.726
Wait...
Shit, I gotta get...

18:15.759 --> 18:17.496
Really?

18:17.528 --> 18:19.097
Smells like piss.

18:25.203 --> 18:26.805
Didn't get my keys
on purpose.

18:26.838 --> 18:29.274
Joy insisted on taking
all dry cleaning

18:29.306 --> 18:31.308
to the commons
in calabasas.

18:31.342 --> 18:32.643
The man who ran the store

18:32.677 --> 18:34.780
always complimented
their taste in clothing.

18:34.813 --> 18:38.417
Something Joy refused
to let go of.

18:38.449 --> 18:41.319
It can be oddly important,
encouragement.

18:42.687 --> 18:44.488
What's going on here?

18:44.522 --> 18:47.225
With the drinking in the
middle of the day on tuesday?

18:47.257 --> 18:49.193
I mean, I like it,
don't get me wrong.

18:49.226 --> 18:51.530
It's cool.
But it's not like you.

18:51.563 --> 18:53.832
We might as well be honest.

18:53.864 --> 18:55.400
-We are...
-We're depressed.

18:55.432 --> 18:56.834
-incredibly depressed.
-So you are sad.

18:56.868 --> 18:58.203
I didn't know if you were
just like partying

18:58.236 --> 18:59.603
or if you're actually sad.

18:59.637 --> 19:01.640
Partying in calabasas?
Yeah.

19:01.672 --> 19:03.842
No, we're upset.
We're hanging on.

19:03.874 --> 19:04.842
This is Dan.

19:04.876 --> 19:06.545
This is us upset.

19:06.578 --> 19:08.547
Why, why do you feel...

19:08.580 --> 19:09.714
What face are you doing?

19:09.746 --> 19:12.183
He's one of my favorites.

19:12.217 --> 19:14.186
It's like we're not getting support
when it comes to the record coming out,

19:14.218 --> 19:16.654
help with this film
we wanna get made.

19:16.688 --> 19:17.711
They don't want us to tour,
they want us to be here...

19:17.712 --> 19:18.223
They don't want us to tour.

19:18.255 --> 19:19.791
Auditioning for horrible
little slasher films.

19:19.823 --> 19:22.526
Where you die naked
in a really weird scene.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.696
-Like literally, shit like that.
-It's great... yeah...

19:24.728 --> 19:26.497
-It's like...
-Okay, well let me ask you this.

19:26.531 --> 19:27.698
You should've listened
to the audition

19:27.732 --> 19:29.134
that we had to run
the other day

19:29.167 --> 19:30.435
for a movie
called "the divide."

19:30.467 --> 19:31.669
-It was appalling.
-It was appalling.

19:31.703 --> 19:33.305
And this is like
a movie that literally

19:33.338 --> 19:35.540
they would give their
left arm for us to book.

19:35.573 --> 19:38.276
The den is a dark place.
I never wanna go back.

19:39.811 --> 19:42.680
I can't believe
you really did fall.

19:42.714 --> 19:44.850
What was captivity like?

19:46.484 --> 19:48.820
I don't wanna go into it.

19:48.852 --> 19:51.622
But Jessup,
he lost his arm.

19:51.656 --> 19:53.792
And Jonah,

19:53.824 --> 19:55.459
he has no leg...

19:55.493 --> 19:57.329
Legs.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.870
Those are always
the first to go.

20:09.239 --> 20:11.509
That boy loved to climb.

20:14.245 --> 20:15.546
Let me ask you,

20:15.580 --> 20:19.384
what is your ultimate goal
would you say?

20:19.417 --> 20:22.486
Like what if you had to tell
somebody in five to ten years

20:22.519 --> 20:26.390
this is where I wanna be,
what is that?

20:26.423 --> 20:29.860
I wanna be super legit.

20:29.893 --> 20:31.729
For sure.
But can we like...

20:31.763 --> 20:33.165
Narrow that down
a little bit.

20:33.198 --> 20:34.533
Be more specific.

20:34.565 --> 20:36.735
That's definitely...
Yeah, that's a wide...

20:37.968 --> 20:39.603
I think just respected.

20:39.637 --> 20:42.174
I wanna be the greatest
comedic actress of my time.

20:42.207 --> 20:45.310
Of like, my age.

20:45.342 --> 20:46.811
Well, shit.

20:46.843 --> 20:48.246
I'll cheers to that.

20:48.278 --> 20:49.613
Not something
I've never heard before

20:49.647 --> 20:50.782
-but sure, I liked it.
-But you know what?

20:50.814 --> 20:51.815
That, that's totally possible.

20:51.849 --> 20:53.952
You could do that.

20:53.985 --> 20:56.188
It's just about setting the
intention and moving towards it.

20:56.220 --> 20:58.522
But people also don't really
have trust in women

20:58.555 --> 21:00.391
-being able to make movies either.
-Right.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.394
So that's, I think,
maybe the biggest part.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.961
Honestly, I should've
been born with a dick.

21:03.962 --> 21:05.115
-So we wanna be men.
-We'd be a lot happier.

21:05.116 --> 21:07.232
We wanna be men.
That's what we wanna be.

21:07.265 --> 21:09.434
-We missed you, Dan.
-I missed you guys.

21:09.467 --> 21:13.838
You know what we need, is we
need a Dan, Elle, and Joy hang.

21:13.871 --> 21:15.607
-A little smoky-smoke time.
-For sure.

21:15.640 --> 21:16.908
-In your bed.
-Absolutely.

21:16.940 --> 21:18.309
-With some chips.
-I miss that.

21:18.342 --> 21:19.611
-Chip bed!
-Chip bed!

21:19.643 --> 21:21.246
Then we'd smoke
and get the munchies

21:21.278 --> 21:23.247
and the little chips
would be everywhere.

21:23.281 --> 21:24.783
And the chips would... you guys
always thought that was weird.

21:24.815 --> 21:27.552
It's strange. It was
abnormally crumb heavy.

21:27.584 --> 21:29.453
It was a lot of crumbs.
Heavy on the crumbs.

21:29.486 --> 21:32.323
It was almost kinda like you just
took the bag and just went...

21:32.357 --> 21:34.559
It was almost... it's nice
to lay on a bed of crumbs.

21:34.592 --> 21:36.695
There's almost
an erotic quality to it.

21:36.727 --> 21:38.362
Does this affect women when you try
to bring them over to your house

21:38.396 --> 21:39.798
-and they notice it too?
-What, all the chips? No.

21:39.831 --> 21:41.265
Do they ever like get
in there and go like,

21:41.298 --> 21:42.700
-"it hurts."
-A little crunchy.

21:42.734 --> 21:44.436
Most girls like it.
It's intriguing.

21:44.468 --> 21:45.970
You know, they don't know
what they're feeling.

21:46.004 --> 21:47.505
It's a little bit of pain.
A little bit of pleasure.

21:47.537 --> 21:49.006
They're like is...

21:49.040 --> 21:51.743
Is that a chip in my ass or...

21:51.775 --> 21:53.945
That's a chip in your ass, baby.

21:53.977 --> 21:56.380
And I'ma get it.

21:56.413 --> 21:57.815
I eat that chip.

21:59.383 --> 22:02.286
No. No.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.855
Is that a
tortilla or is that a...

22:03.888 --> 22:05.256
Is that a...
Is that a...

22:08.726 --> 22:10.361
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

22:10.394 --> 22:11.695
I'm just saying,
I know you got cute girls

22:11.728 --> 22:13.832
that you could
throw my way.

22:13.864 --> 22:15.699
-It won't come to that.
-No, we're not doing that.

22:15.733 --> 22:17.969
Anyway...

22:18.002 --> 22:20.538
I'm gonna hook up
with all your friends.

22:20.571 --> 22:22.874
-You're a jerk.
-Whether you like it or not,

22:22.907 --> 22:24.743
I'm gonna kiss
all your friends.

22:24.775 --> 22:26.443
-You're already bad enough with us.
-How many female friends

22:26.476 --> 22:27.579
-have you made out with?
-Since when?

22:27.611 --> 22:28.679
-Since...
-In my life?

22:28.713 --> 22:30.649
I don't know,
since chip bed.

22:30.681 --> 22:31.665
What?

22:31.666 --> 22:34.618
We kissed that night.
You don't remember?

22:34.651 --> 22:36.353
What are you
talking about?

22:36.387 --> 22:37.956
What are you talking about?

22:37.988 --> 22:39.757
What are you talking about
that I'm talking about?

22:39.791 --> 22:41.893
Have you... did you...
Have you told her that?

22:41.926 --> 22:43.962
Or was that first... no,
it's coming out now I'm sorry.

22:43.995 --> 22:45.664
We maybe...

22:45.697 --> 22:47.832
-Had sex? What the fuck?
-No.

22:47.864 --> 22:50.792
Got fingered with a chip?
I mean, what are you...

22:50.793 --> 22:51.769
My gosh!

22:51.803 --> 22:53.772
What? No.
We... we made out.

22:53.804 --> 22:55.840
We had a little make-out
session on the chip bed.

22:55.872 --> 22:58.309
-When you were asleep.
-Well yeah, I mean, it was years ago.

22:58.342 --> 23:00.378
-It was like for a second...
-how many Dan?

23:00.410 --> 23:02.580
-How many have you kissed?
-Why are you doing this?

23:02.612 --> 23:04.448
-It's getting weird now.
-How many girls?

23:04.482 --> 23:06.351
-It is...
-Just stop. Stop yourself.

23:06.383 --> 23:10.020
You're getting a little weird.
How is your mom?

23:10.053 --> 23:12.390
Mama Lynn.
It's been too long.

23:14.992 --> 23:17.428
-It's good.
-She's good.

23:17.461 --> 23:18.428
She's good. Thanks again.

23:18.429 --> 23:20.364
That was the least
convincing, "she's great."

23:20.398 --> 23:22.634
-She is dating a guy named, cowboy Lou.
-You know what, she's happy.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.601
-And he's not a cowboy.
-Yeah...

23:24.634 --> 23:26.904
He like works
at a winery, I think.

23:26.938 --> 23:28.540
She's dating a cowboy that
works at a... that's cool.

23:28.541 --> 23:29.341
They're living together.

23:29.373 --> 23:31.108
-They're literally living together.
-She's known him for two weeks.

23:31.141 --> 23:32.409
-Two weeks and they're living together?
-Yeah.

23:32.442 --> 23:34.645
Is she happy?

23:34.678 --> 23:35.579
She's really happy.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.381
Well, then that's all
that matters, right?

23:37.415 --> 23:39.384
I don't know.

24:04.675 --> 24:05.777
Now bring it back.
Bring it back.

24:06.878 --> 24:07.913
Yeah.

24:11.114 --> 24:12.683
Can you please not
get on the freeway?

24:12.717 --> 24:14.060
Go up the hill
to our old house.

24:14.061 --> 24:15.219
Why?

24:15.220 --> 24:17.621
'Cause I wanna be there
for memory purposes.

24:17.655 --> 24:19.624
What? You're so weird.
And no.

24:19.657 --> 24:21.092
You have to get past
the gate, dummy.

24:21.124 --> 24:22.626
You think they're
gonna forget us?

24:22.659 --> 24:23.995
Pervert Sam is probably
still working there,

24:24.027 --> 24:25.729
he'll let us in.

24:28.064 --> 24:30.501
-I'm serious.
-I wanna hop the fence and take a swim.

24:30.534 --> 24:32.836
It'll feel adventurous,
and nice.

24:32.870 --> 24:34.572
I wanna do it.
They're not in town right now.

24:34.604 --> 24:36.841
They're in France in June.
You know that.

24:36.873 --> 24:37.736
Yeah, but there's
probably somebody

24:37.737 --> 24:38.742
there that's waiting,
watching the house.

24:38.775 --> 24:40.978
There's no way they have
someone there that's waiting.

24:41.012 --> 24:42.679
No way.
We can easily do this.

24:42.713 --> 24:44.649
We talk about being spontaneous
all the fucking time.

24:44.681 --> 24:46.016
And today
I wanna be spontaneous.

24:46.050 --> 24:48.787
I wanna sit there
and feel like a kid.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.588
Yeah...
I miss being a kid.

24:50.621 --> 24:52.023
'Kay. This roundabout,
turn around.

24:52.055 --> 24:55.192
-Fine.
-I knew that would work.

24:55.226 --> 24:58.103
Do I have to show some
cleavage or something?

24:58.104 --> 24:59.063
Yep.

24:59.095 --> 25:02.433
-That's high-collared.
-Shit.

25:02.467 --> 25:03.534
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, you're bait.

25:03.567 --> 25:05.002
-Hi, hey.
-Hi, Sam.

25:05.035 --> 25:06.837
-Hey.
-Yeah. It's so good to see you.

25:06.871 --> 25:08.806
-How are you?
-Very nice to see you too. Go on in.

25:12.142 --> 25:14.111
-I think we should do it now.
-Well, if we just... right now?

25:14.144 --> 25:17.047
Yes, today.
We keep fucking putting it off.

25:17.081 --> 25:20.819
My sisters found out our father
was cheating before our mom did.

25:20.851 --> 25:22.219
Waiting for how much longer?

25:22.253 --> 25:24.054
I don't know,
it's already been three weeks.

25:24.088 --> 25:26.157
It was agonizing watching
them decide when to tell her.

25:28.025 --> 25:29.794
It's frustrating.

25:29.826 --> 25:32.630
Well, I'm sorry,
it's not the right time.

25:32.662 --> 25:34.031
-When is the right time?
-In a half hour.

25:34.064 --> 25:37.534
Okay...

25:37.567 --> 25:39.670
I was more upset that they
had to tell her

25:39.704 --> 25:43.975
than that he had done it
in the first place.

25:44.007 --> 25:46.510
You know,

25:46.544 --> 25:49.746
the worst part is that...

25:49.780 --> 25:53.118
My dad can really be
a wonderful person.

25:54.552 --> 25:56.920
Always when you
least expect.

25:57.955 --> 25:59.890
Truly wonderful.

25:59.923 --> 26:01.859
What if she just
finds out on her own?

26:01.892 --> 26:03.627
No.

26:03.660 --> 26:05.129
No, I'm saying, what if she
just fucking figures it out

26:05.161 --> 26:06.630
because he starts to become
more lazy about it.

26:18.042 --> 26:19.677
-Ready?
-Yep.

26:19.709 --> 26:20.678
-Okay, on the count of three.
-Okay.

26:20.710 --> 26:24.582
One... two...

26:24.614 --> 26:25.816
Three!

27:27.311 --> 27:29.714
It's too cold out
when you're holding it under.

27:29.746 --> 27:31.917
The game's not the same.

27:36.187 --> 27:39.223
A lot of people say my sisters
need to let go of the past

27:39.255 --> 27:43.361
but I can see why
they don't want to.

27:43.393 --> 27:46.130
This house is amazing.

27:50.834 --> 27:52.603
-Elle?
-Yeah?

27:52.637 --> 27:54.639
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay. Are you?

27:54.671 --> 27:56.740
-You with me?
-Yeah.

28:02.079 --> 28:04.382
Shit, life was so much easier
when we lived here.

28:04.415 --> 28:06.184
Yeah, no kidding.

28:06.217 --> 28:07.819
You never realize it
in the moment, do you?

28:07.851 --> 28:09.853
Never.

28:09.887 --> 28:11.923
It's like, "mom, can you
make me a sandwich.

28:14.025 --> 28:17.195
Dad, can you
wash my car?"

28:20.965 --> 28:22.667
I just wanna be
a kid again.

28:22.699 --> 28:24.101
No kidding.

28:25.369 --> 28:27.071
It's the best.

28:27.103 --> 28:29.373
It really is.

28:29.407 --> 28:31.943
I want that feeling again,
you know?

28:31.976 --> 28:34.812
It's gone. It's not
coming back anytime soon.

28:34.844 --> 28:36.113
Shit.

28:38.416 --> 28:40.351
When we have kids though,
we'll get it back.

28:40.383 --> 28:43.353
And we'll live vicariously
through them.

28:43.387 --> 28:47.325
Yeah...

28:53.430 --> 28:55.232
I just wanna go back.

29:05.376 --> 29:07.211
And all of a sudden, bam.

29:07.244 --> 29:10.313
Our mom taught my sisters
how to train squirrels

29:10.346 --> 29:13.016
but never had
a well-trained dog.

29:13.050 --> 29:16.053
She arrived for flights
hours in advance.

29:16.086 --> 29:19.122
She never packed sexy panties
on her trips with our dad.

29:19.156 --> 29:23.194
She punished Joy for intentionally
stripping her vocal cords at school.

29:23.226 --> 29:26.063
She encouraged her girls
to bring friends over

29:26.096 --> 29:29.733
but never respected parents
who didn't introduce themselves.

29:29.766 --> 29:33.871
She had my sisters stop eating
fast food at 18 and 16.

29:33.903 --> 29:38.108
She loved to cook, but never
taught my sisters how.

29:38.141 --> 29:40.711
Maybe she wanted
to be needed.

29:40.745 --> 29:44.282
Gardening was a therapy that she
guilted them for not helping with.

29:46.484 --> 29:48.820
She realized
when my sisters moved out

29:48.852 --> 29:52.090
that she had
almost no friends.

30:03.033 --> 30:04.502
-excuse me?
-Hi.

30:04.534 --> 30:06.204
Are you guys supposed
to be here?

30:49.345 --> 30:51.082
Don't you think it's kinda weird

30:51.114 --> 30:54.217
that we go all the way
to calabasas for dry cleaning?

30:54.251 --> 30:56.788
No, I like going
to the commons, it's sweet.

30:56.821 --> 30:59.157
Yeah, we should probably find a
new place that's like closer.

31:06.362 --> 31:07.966
I need to stop.

31:13.003 --> 31:23.014
Hey, if I tell you something,
do you promise not to tell mom?

31:19.476 --> 31:23.014
It kinda depends on what it is.

31:23.046 --> 31:24.582
No, you just have to agree that
you're not going to tell mom.

31:24.614 --> 31:26.284
Because this is
between you and I

31:26.316 --> 31:29.853
and it's something private.
So... just say that.

31:29.887 --> 31:32.223
I don't like that.

31:32.255 --> 31:34.324
No, it's not a big deal,
just promise me

31:34.358 --> 31:35.592
just to stay calm
and not freak out

31:35.626 --> 31:37.228
-and not tell mom.
-No, I won't.

31:37.261 --> 31:40.865
Can we stop up here, please?

31:40.898 --> 31:42.132
Hold on, hold on.

31:42.166 --> 31:43.568
I just gotta
catch my breath.

31:43.601 --> 31:46.904
The fuck?

31:46.937 --> 31:49.540
-You're out of shape.
-Gotta do more cardio.

31:49.573 --> 31:51.376
Yeah, no kidding.

31:55.312 --> 31:58.248
Okay, I need you to come
with me to the gyno tomorrow

31:58.282 --> 32:00.385
because they think
I have cervical cancer.

32:02.585 --> 32:03.487
Cancer?

32:18.569 --> 32:21.973
Elle always ordered
what Joy did at restaurants.

32:22.005 --> 32:25.976
Even though Joy was younger,
she was the first to kiss a boy,

32:26.009 --> 32:29.146
first to have her period,
first to lose her virginity.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.515
My sisters
truly believed

32:32.548 --> 32:36.419
angels watched
over them as children.

32:36.453 --> 32:38.423
I'm not sure
they still do.

32:42.392 --> 32:44.060
That's cute.

32:44.093 --> 32:48.632
-Right? Farewell, ladies.
-Yeah.

32:48.666 --> 32:50.434
Seeing Dan made me think

32:50.467 --> 32:54.505
that I haven't been
on a date in ten months.

32:55.605 --> 32:58.909
-Come here.
-Yeah.

33:03.514 --> 33:06.250
That's him on set.
He booked a fucking movie.

33:06.283 --> 33:08.619
-With her?
-Yeah!

33:08.651 --> 33:10.453
I guarantee
it's a small role.

33:10.486 --> 33:12.689
Has to be.
Not listed in the trades.

33:12.723 --> 33:14.191
No fan sites are
listing about it.

33:14.224 --> 33:15.993
No blogs.

33:16.025 --> 33:17.594
-Okay, you did your research.
-He looks horrible there.

33:17.628 --> 33:20.097
That's bad. Who would part
their hair like that?

33:20.130 --> 33:21.332
I like it,
it's kinda messy.

33:23.367 --> 33:25.269
That's bad,
the teeth are really bad there.

33:25.302 --> 33:27.071
Well, I think he kind of like
got them fixed a little bit.

33:27.103 --> 33:28.471
He got caps.

33:28.505 --> 33:31.141
No, I don't think so.
I think that's him.

33:31.142 --> 33:31.960
They look like dentures.

33:31.961 --> 33:34.044
No, I think he just got
them like shaved a little.

33:34.078 --> 33:34.620
Shaved?

33:34.621 --> 33:36.247
Yeah, you know how
they just even them out.

33:36.280 --> 33:37.715
-They look bigger.
-No, it looks cute.

33:37.747 --> 33:40.150
Just fucking agree with me
like I want you to.

33:40.184 --> 33:41.485
I'm just being real with
you, bro. He looks good.

33:41.517 --> 33:43.219
Fuck. No.
Most of these are bad.

33:43.253 --> 33:44.455
They're probably dating.

33:44.487 --> 33:46.090
They could be.

33:46.122 --> 33:47.457
No, they're definitely dating.
You can tell.

33:47.490 --> 33:49.292
-They have like a thing.
-Shut up.

33:49.325 --> 33:51.495
-Are you a little jealous?
-I know what you're doing.

33:51.527 --> 33:53.029
"They're dating."

33:53.063 --> 33:54.532
-Yeah?
-See? That one's ugly.

33:54.564 --> 33:55.666
He looks awesome.

33:55.698 --> 33:57.234
-Say that one's bad.
-Hot.

33:59.303 --> 34:01.237
Work with me.

34:01.271 --> 34:03.674
Fine. He looks okay
in some of these.

34:03.707 --> 34:05.575
Don't be bitter.
There, there.

34:05.609 --> 34:07.144
No, I'm over it anyway.

34:07.177 --> 34:08.610
That's what we all say.

34:08.643 --> 34:11.315
Over it enough
to look it up.

34:17.085 --> 34:18.420
Do I look good?

34:18.454 --> 34:20.690
-I feel round.
-What do you mean?

34:20.724 --> 34:22.994
My butt. It's full.

34:23.025 --> 34:24.260
It likes to come out.

34:24.293 --> 34:26.996
Dudes like that.

34:27.030 --> 34:29.299
Yeah...

34:29.331 --> 34:31.202
I shouldn't have
canceled Jerry.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.635
I feel like shit.

34:32.668 --> 34:34.337
Cancelling Jerry
for one session

34:34.371 --> 34:36.005
is not gonna change
your entire body.

34:36.039 --> 34:38.007
Hold on, though.
If you're saying that,

34:38.041 --> 34:39.610
that means you kind
of agree.

34:39.641 --> 34:41.110
-So I am. I look bigger.
-No, no, no, no, no.

34:41.143 --> 34:42.380
I'm not.
No, I'm not.

34:42.411 --> 34:44.347
I mean, what,
how much do you weigh?

34:44.380 --> 34:46.083
I'm like five pounds
over what I usually am.

34:46.114 --> 34:49.052
That's bad?

34:49.085 --> 34:50.353
no.

34:50.387 --> 34:54.025
That was a bad reaction.

34:54.056 --> 34:55.592
-Sorry.
-It's muscle.

34:55.626 --> 34:57.428
Please.
I hate when people say that.

34:57.461 --> 34:59.263
I know, I hate it too
but it's kinda true.

34:59.296 --> 35:00.564
That your butt is muscle.

35:00.597 --> 35:05.336
No, that muscle
adds pounds.

35:05.369 --> 35:07.137
So that's
most of it, I guess.

35:07.171 --> 35:10.341
-I think you look great, more or less.
-"More or less?"

35:10.374 --> 35:12.109
Actually we would probably
create the ultimate human being.

35:12.142 --> 35:14.378
The perfect human being!
Yeah.

35:14.410 --> 35:16.514
Visually it would have
our best attributes.

35:16.546 --> 35:18.314
My eye shape
with your lashes,

35:18.347 --> 35:20.784
with my lips,
with my teeth,

35:20.818 --> 35:22.486
with your nose,

35:22.519 --> 35:25.122
with your hair...

35:25.155 --> 35:28.825
-I like that.
-With your butt.

35:28.858 --> 35:31.094
Willow,
what do you think?

35:31.128 --> 35:34.664
I think I know what she's
been thinking about.

35:34.697 --> 35:37.834
She's been thinking about you
telling mom about your tests.

35:37.867 --> 35:40.770
She told me.

35:40.803 --> 35:44.575
"Elle, will you please
tell mommy about your testings."

35:44.608 --> 35:47.311
She needs to know.
She really does.

35:47.343 --> 35:48.746
And I feel like
if she comes

35:48.778 --> 35:50.280
before the party
really gets going...

35:50.314 --> 35:51.682
Joy, we're not telling mom
about my test.

35:51.715 --> 35:52.749
-Really?
-No.

35:52.782 --> 35:54.451
We're not gonna
tell her.

35:54.485 --> 35:56.486
Joy, we're waiting
until she's here at the house

35:56.519 --> 35:58.822
and by the way, she's gonna
be late like she always is.

35:58.856 --> 36:00.424
No, no, no.
Tell her here at the party.

36:00.456 --> 36:02.445
Set aside, go to another
room, and explain it to her.

36:02.446 --> 36:04.428
Yeah, except then
she'll start drinking,

36:04.461 --> 36:05.696
and she'll accidentally say
something to one of our friends

36:05.729 --> 36:07.665
'cause she's like drunk
and having fun.

36:07.697 --> 36:09.566
And she thinks
it's funny to say something.

36:09.599 --> 36:11.434
I'm sorry,
I'm not doing that.

36:11.468 --> 36:12.703
I don't know why you're so weird
about me having to tell her.

36:12.735 --> 36:14.504
I know...
I don't...

36:14.537 --> 36:16.873
Because you keep saying saturday
and that's the day we leave.

36:16.907 --> 36:18.609
I mean, yeah,
I'll text her at the airport.

36:18.642 --> 36:21.544
We can't just send you
on the road if there's an issue.

36:21.577 --> 36:23.346
I don't think
the news is gonna be bad,

36:23.380 --> 36:24.849
I'm just saying we should
be ready to tell mom soon.

36:24.881 --> 36:26.650
Okay, well, I'm not...
I'm not telling mom, period.

36:26.682 --> 36:28.818
You tell her every single
little detail about your life

36:28.852 --> 36:30.354
and I don't have to do
the exact same thing too.

36:30.387 --> 36:31.722
We're two
different people.

36:31.755 --> 36:34.291
So don't say anything
until we know for sure.

36:39.229 --> 36:40.832
Sorry.

36:49.673 --> 36:52.543
She's mad at me.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.736
The only thing Elle
really loved about the house

37:19.769 --> 37:22.805
was the view of the canyon
from her bed.

37:22.838 --> 37:27.378
It was a simple view
that you grew to love.

37:27.410 --> 37:30.447
You can grow
to love almost anything.

37:30.479 --> 37:32.150
It's god's gift.

37:35.718 --> 37:38.588
Are you sad 'cause
your mommies fight?

37:40.923 --> 37:42.826
Are you sad
because your mommies fight?

37:50.601 --> 37:53.604
I'm sorry.

37:53.637 --> 37:56.474
It's sad...

38:05.782 --> 38:08.352
Joy wanted
Elle to demonstrate repeatedly

38:08.385 --> 38:09.954
how much
she needed her.

38:09.986 --> 38:12.590
Elle wanted Joy
not to need her so much.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.639
-Elle, look at this.
-Yeah?

38:28.671 --> 38:31.407
-What?
-It's like a big dick.

38:31.441 --> 38:34.778
-What?
-Look it.

38:37.914 --> 38:39.783
I can't find the power...
Shit!

38:41.485 --> 38:42.885
We're good.

38:42.918 --> 38:45.589
Yes! Yes!
Come to mama.

38:46.889 --> 38:48.791
You're gonna fall.

38:48.825 --> 38:50.561
-The gardeners are fired.
-No shit.

38:50.593 --> 38:52.396
-Text them.
-I can't do that. It's rude.

38:52.428 --> 38:53.530
Let's ask mom
what we should do.

38:53.563 --> 38:55.532
Joy, we text mom
about everything

38:55.564 --> 38:56.800
about 500 times a day.

38:56.832 --> 38:58.269
I think we can
handle this on our own.

38:58.302 --> 38:59.637
She's not gonna be
around forever

38:59.669 --> 39:01.338
-for us to ask her questions.
-All right.

39:01.371 --> 39:03.606
I'm sick of you fucking saying
things like that.

39:03.639 --> 39:04.941
-Really?
-Yes, it's rude.

39:04.974 --> 39:06.309
Because if I was her,

39:06.343 --> 39:07.778
I would be super annoyed
with you.

39:07.811 --> 39:09.579
-Really?
-Yeah, I'd fucking hate it.

39:09.613 --> 39:12.448
How's this for annoying?

39:12.481 --> 39:16.019
-Joy. Joy stop.
-Yeah, you like that?

39:16.052 --> 39:17.453
Are you
out of your mind?

39:17.486 --> 39:19.389
-That good?
-Joy, stop!

39:19.423 --> 39:20.890
Good, you feel good?
You feel blown?

39:20.923 --> 39:21.958
Stop.

39:23.593 --> 39:26.030
You are a very disturbed
young woman.

39:26.063 --> 39:27.997
Hey, John!

39:28.030 --> 39:29.663
Did the gardeners
come for you?

39:29.664 --> 39:31.835
Yeah, I think so.
What happened to your pants?

39:31.836 --> 39:33.469
We're good, we're
gonna get rid of them.

39:33.503 --> 39:36.039
You're in your underwear,
you freak.

39:36.072 --> 39:38.441
-He's gay.
-So he's gay?

39:38.474 --> 39:40.810
Okay, so that means it's fine
for you to be in your underwear?

39:40.843 --> 39:42.679
Next time
terminix comes over,

39:42.713 --> 39:44.615
why don't you just greet him
at the door in your underwear.

39:44.648 --> 39:46.450
Ernie's different.

39:46.483 --> 39:50.653
I'm a little
worried sometimes.

39:50.686 --> 39:53.790
About what?
Me? The gyno stuff?

39:53.823 --> 39:55.959
No, no, no, no.
I think you're gonna be fine.

39:55.992 --> 39:58.696
-Thanks.
-I do.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.931
I've been praying
about it.

40:00.963 --> 40:03.733
I worry about mom.
Just her and cowboy Lou.

40:03.767 --> 40:05.569
Like she tends to just
disappear and do her own thing.

40:05.602 --> 40:07.738
-Yeah.
-I don't wanna lose her.

40:07.771 --> 40:09.807
I feel like we've
already lost dad

40:09.840 --> 40:13.044
and it's kinda redundant
and horrible if we lose both.

40:17.546 --> 40:19.983
We're not
gonna lose mom.

40:30.093 --> 40:32.363
We are doing the dance.

40:34.030 --> 40:35.466
This is my cocktail.

40:38.802 --> 40:40.838
My girl drinks heavy.

40:42.506 --> 40:45.542
I... saw you sitting
at the bar.

40:45.575 --> 40:47.410
And wanted you
to dance with me.

40:47.443 --> 40:49.579
Do I know you?

40:49.613 --> 40:52.082
-Gregory.
-Gregory?

40:52.115 --> 40:54.352
-Pleasure. Janet.
-Pleasure.

40:57.686 --> 41:00.556
That was too masculine,
I shouldn't do that move.

41:00.590 --> 41:02.626
Yeah.

41:02.659 --> 41:04.528
Shall we set down
our drinks?

41:12.802 --> 41:15.405
What are you doing later?

41:15.439 --> 41:17.908
-I'm going to Jimmy's bar?
-Jimmy's bar?

41:17.941 --> 41:20.611
Yeah. You never heard of it?
I love that place.

41:20.644 --> 41:22.513
My tits are shaking.

41:22.546 --> 41:23.914
Does that ever
happen to you?

41:23.947 --> 41:26.117
Only on the weekends
when I let 'em loose.

41:31.621 --> 41:34.023
You're the guy,
you can't have boobs.

41:34.057 --> 41:36.593
Yes, guys sometimes
have man titties.

41:36.626 --> 41:38.528
-So Gregory's out of shape?
-Yes.

41:38.561 --> 41:40.063
-All right.
-He's a little thick in the waist.

41:40.095 --> 41:42.099
I know, it's good to know
for our story.

41:42.131 --> 41:43.934
Gregory,
you work out often?

41:43.967 --> 41:45.735
No, I just
drink whiskey.

41:45.769 --> 41:47.705
I feel like you look
a little soft.

41:50.474 --> 41:52.575
Sorry, that's rude,
we just met.

42:45.095 --> 42:47.197
-Hey, Elle?
-Yeah.

42:47.229 --> 42:49.867
You're killing me up here with the
nail Polish fumes and the smoke.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.901
Why are you doing this?

42:51.934 --> 42:53.603
I'm sorry. I'm stressed and I
want my nails to look nice.

42:55.137 --> 42:56.706
We're getting ready for a party
and our mother is here.

42:56.740 --> 42:58.742
Hold on! We're coming down.

42:58.775 --> 43:00.811
-Can you get the gate?
-She always does this. She has a key.

43:00.843 --> 43:02.211
-Please get the gate.
-I don't have a damn key.

43:02.244 --> 43:04.213
-Mom, use your key.
-Mom, we're trying to get ready.

43:04.247 --> 43:05.916
We gave you two keys.

43:05.948 --> 43:08.584
I don't have
a key with me.

43:08.617 --> 43:09.820
There's an extra key
in that pot.

43:09.852 --> 43:11.621
We can't come down
right now.

43:11.655 --> 43:13.090
I want somebody to come down
and let me in.

43:13.122 --> 43:14.791
No, this is really rude.
I just drove all the way...

43:14.823 --> 43:16.994
If you face the gate
to your left, there's a pot.

43:17.026 --> 43:19.862
And in the pot there's a little hose
head that looks like it's fake.

43:19.896 --> 43:22.164
I don't wanna have to dig
through it and look for it.

43:22.197 --> 43:22.875
I just... we're here...

43:22.876 --> 43:24.233
Okay, all right, all
right, all right, all right.

43:24.267 --> 43:26.469
Just let me... Joy,
what is wrong with you?

43:26.470 --> 43:27.571
I'm coming down.

43:27.604 --> 43:28.639
She's been emotional.

43:28.671 --> 43:30.006
Will you shut up, please?

43:30.039 --> 43:31.874
What? You have.
And it was dumb to invite dad.

43:31.907 --> 43:34.911
No, I'm sorry I like sharing
things with my family.

43:34.945 --> 43:36.580
Like cancer tests.

43:36.613 --> 43:38.081
Cancer tests?

43:38.113 --> 43:40.117
Elle had a test this week
for cervical cancer.

43:40.150 --> 43:41.651
They were worried
they found something.

43:41.684 --> 43:43.719
It's nothing.
It's nothing. They just...

43:43.753 --> 43:45.889
They wanna make sure that
it's an abnormal test result.

43:45.921 --> 43:47.023
It was a follow up.

43:47.057 --> 43:48.225
How do you not
tell me this?

43:48.258 --> 43:49.960
Thanks for keeping
a secret, Joy.

43:49.992 --> 43:52.328
I'm sorry, I don't like secrets
when it comes to family.

43:52.361 --> 43:53.764
This is mom, okay?
No. Had to.

43:53.796 --> 43:54.865
Well, she wants
to have her own life.

43:54.898 --> 43:56.033
So I'm letting
her have it.

43:56.066 --> 43:57.267
Well, Elle,
that's different.

43:57.300 --> 43:59.135
-That is completely unfair.
-Yeah.

43:59.168 --> 44:01.137
Well, you were the one that
said we come to you too much.

44:01.171 --> 44:03.073
And you want this new era where
you're living your own life,

44:03.106 --> 44:04.707
so there you go.

44:04.740 --> 44:06.175
It's completely reasonable
that your mom would want

44:06.209 --> 44:08.879
to make her own friends
and go on trips

44:08.912 --> 44:12.282
and take care
of the things in her life.

44:12.314 --> 44:15.985
My mom died when she was ten
years older than I am right now.

44:16.019 --> 44:18.755
Ten years,
I have to live those ten years

44:18.787 --> 44:20.023
as fully as I can.

44:20.055 --> 44:22.592
And if that means,
horses and hiking

44:22.626 --> 44:23.794
and spending time
with my lover,

44:23.827 --> 44:25.861
then that's what
I need to do.

44:25.894 --> 44:27.898
But that doesn't mean I'm not
concerned if you're in a hospital.

44:27.930 --> 44:30.700
Mom, you're not gonna die
in ten years from now.

44:30.733 --> 44:32.768
That's so young. How can you
say something like that?

44:32.802 --> 44:34.171
And I'm not
in a hospital.

44:34.204 --> 44:35.639
And this lover of yours

44:35.671 --> 44:37.073
you've known
for two weeks.

44:37.106 --> 44:38.275
-What did they say?
-That's true.

44:38.307 --> 44:40.677
They don't know.
I'll find out tomorrow.

44:40.709 --> 44:42.278
Don't get
carried away, god.

44:42.311 --> 44:44.046
-Told her, she should tell you.
-Shut up, Joy.

44:44.079 --> 44:46.182
Okay.

44:46.215 --> 44:48.384
My heart did start to beat a little
too fast there for a minute.

44:48.418 --> 44:49.986
Yeah. Mine too.

44:50.019 --> 44:53.389
Now, Elle's right.
We shouldn't get worried.

44:53.423 --> 44:56.193
Until we actually know that there's
something to be worried about.

44:56.226 --> 44:58.928
Joy's worried you're
moving too fast with Lou.

44:58.961 --> 45:00.997
We're getting married.

45:01.030 --> 45:02.765
I know it,
he's the one.

45:02.798 --> 45:05.001
I am totally in love.

45:05.035 --> 45:07.971
-Mom...
-Okay, that's great mom...

45:08.003 --> 45:10.339
But you've known this guy
for two weeks.

45:10.372 --> 45:12.775
-Two weeks.
-Okay. And his name is Lou.

45:12.809 --> 45:14.745
-Say it out loud, "Lou."
-"Lou."

45:14.778 --> 45:17.014
I know, I know.
I get it.

45:17.046 --> 45:20.050
I told him, if I'm gonna take your last
name, you have to change your first.

45:20.082 --> 45:21.785
Okay. Wait. Hold on.

45:21.818 --> 45:23.285
You're talking
about name changes

45:23.318 --> 45:24.353
and marriage already.

45:24.387 --> 45:26.189
What is going on?

45:26.222 --> 45:29.092
If you guys could hear the
messages he leaves for me.

45:29.124 --> 45:31.961
Your father isn't even capable
of kindness like this.

45:31.994 --> 45:34.263
I know. We love
that Lou is sweet to you.

45:34.296 --> 45:36.198
Mom, but we've
also noticed

45:36.231 --> 45:38.200
you're drinking
a lot more with him.

45:38.233 --> 45:40.436
Stop it. I hardly drink
at all with him.

45:40.470 --> 45:42.839
No, no, no, no. No drinking
tonight. It's not happening.

45:42.872 --> 45:44.174
You could say it
a little nicer.

45:44.206 --> 45:46.342
Maybe I'll just bust out
the vaporizer.

45:46.376 --> 45:48.278
Okay, see this is why
you have to be real with her.

45:48.311 --> 45:49.345
-Don't... definitely don't do that.
-Or she doesn't listen.

45:49.378 --> 45:51.781
I'm not drinking tonight.

45:51.814 --> 45:53.749
Okay, just...
Just protect yourself.

45:53.782 --> 45:55.351
That's all I'm saying.

45:55.385 --> 45:56.419
Because who knows if all the
things he's telling you

45:56.452 --> 45:58.255
end up actually
being true, mom.

45:58.287 --> 45:59.889
Yeah, look at Syd. I didn't
know his issues right away.

45:59.923 --> 46:01.058
Still invited
him tonight.

46:01.090 --> 46:02.425
I still have
feelings for him.

46:02.459 --> 46:03.897
-You invited Reed.
-Yeah, has no issues.

46:03.898 --> 46:04.657
He's poor.

46:04.658 --> 46:06.363
That is not why I
broke up with him, Joy.

46:06.396 --> 46:08.765
You both like having
a man around.

46:08.798 --> 46:10.066
That's okay.
It's normal.

46:10.099 --> 46:11.735
Yeah, thank you.
Very normal.

46:11.767 --> 46:15.271
Just don't fall
into bad habits.

46:15.305 --> 46:18.875
Okay. Well let's agree to be cautious
with all men. How about that?

46:18.907 --> 46:20.376
Yeah, but with Lou
I know...

46:20.410 --> 46:23.980
I mean,
it's as clear as...

46:24.012 --> 46:27.016
It's just love.
I know he's younger.

46:27.050 --> 46:29.720
I mean, he is.
But not really.

46:29.753 --> 46:31.354
I met his friends
and I look, you know,

46:31.355 --> 46:33.756
pretty much as young as
they do for the most part.

46:33.789 --> 46:36.192
Take your time, mom.
Just move slow.

46:36.226 --> 46:38.894
'Cause right now, it's like
you're hanging out with him

46:38.927 --> 46:40.396
and we feel like
we're kinda losing you.

46:40.430 --> 46:43.366
And you're on your own.
And you don't call us as much.

46:43.398 --> 46:45.067
Okay, mom.
That's all we're saying.

46:45.101 --> 46:46.970
But this is the kind of love
I've been waiting for.

46:47.003 --> 46:48.905
And he treats me so well.

46:48.938 --> 46:51.173
Okay, well, that's great.
We're really happy for you.

46:51.206 --> 46:52.742
But we're just saying,

46:52.776 --> 46:54.978
that you don't know him
after just two weeks.

46:55.010 --> 46:55.619
No, you don't.

46:55.620 --> 46:57.447
So when you've known him
more, you can say that.

46:57.479 --> 47:00.349
And stop talking about marriage.
It's not allowed. Okay?

47:00.383 --> 47:01.351
I mean, you obviously didn't
know dad well enough.

47:01.383 --> 47:03.320
So I can't trust you.

47:03.352 --> 47:06.822
And that's the point. This is
already completely different.

47:06.856 --> 47:09.226
And while we're there,

47:09.258 --> 47:10.827
he was a great dad
to you guys.

47:10.860 --> 47:12.496
He gave you
a great childhood.

47:12.528 --> 47:15.297
It was good. It was good
when we were little.

47:15.331 --> 47:17.267
Yeah, just that fun thing,
he just lost that.

47:17.300 --> 47:19.903
-Whatever that thing was. Lost that.
-Completely.

47:19.936 --> 47:21.048
Did he ever have it?

47:21.049 --> 47:23.273
Yeah. No. He was
actually kind of adorable.

47:25.842 --> 47:28.278
All I'm saying is, if you're
gonna get married again,

47:28.311 --> 47:30.013
you better do it
the right way.

47:30.046 --> 47:34.284
I knew what I was getting.

47:34.316 --> 47:36.052
But... did you really?

47:36.084 --> 47:37.987
'Cause then you should've
just gotten an annulment.

47:42.492 --> 47:45.128
Yeah, I think I did.

47:45.160 --> 47:47.363
You knew?

47:47.396 --> 47:49.398
I think I did.

47:52.535 --> 47:54.437
Look what
came out of it.

47:54.470 --> 47:58.241
How could I
possibly regret that?

47:58.273 --> 48:00.376
I guess, but you could've still
had really awesome children

48:00.410 --> 48:01.578
with some other dude.

48:01.610 --> 48:03.246
Yeah, but they wouldn't
be you guys.

48:03.278 --> 48:04.514
-True. But you don't know.
-You don't know that.

48:04.546 --> 48:05.849
-You would never know.
-No regrets.

48:05.881 --> 48:07.983
-You would never know...
-no regrets.

48:08.017 --> 48:09.452
-You would never know...
-never any regrets.

48:09.485 --> 48:12.488
-Shut up.
-I love you, mama.

48:12.521 --> 48:15.025
No regrets.

48:15.057 --> 48:18.027
I love you, baby.

48:18.061 --> 48:19.396
So what are you guys
wearing tonight?

48:19.428 --> 48:21.831
We are wearing
really cute dresses.

48:21.865 --> 48:23.099
They're vintage.

48:23.131 --> 48:25.034
And mine looks
kinda like a little...

48:25.068 --> 48:27.204
Like a little sailor girl.
It's really cute.

48:27.236 --> 48:30.072
Adorable.
And what about Joy?

48:30.106 --> 48:33.343
Hers is... Like a heart
shaped little dress,

48:33.376 --> 48:36.345
that is gray and has like
a little shift bottom.

48:36.378 --> 48:38.480
Darlings, darling girls.

48:38.514 --> 48:39.916
You requested some tea.

48:39.948 --> 48:42.084
Is it tea time?
Is it about that time?

48:42.117 --> 48:44.186
All right, this is what dad
would always do.

48:44.220 --> 48:45.322
He'd come in
as Rogers, right?

48:45.354 --> 48:46.555
He'd play
this really really

48:46.588 --> 48:49.058
kind of frothy english
character.

48:49.092 --> 48:50.182
And he had a horrible
accent and we were

48:50.183 --> 48:51.193
these two little
girls he worked for.

48:51.227 --> 48:53.330
And he'd come down
and he'd go,

48:53.363 --> 48:56.032
"girls, it's time for tea. Would
you like a little tea before bed?"

48:56.064 --> 48:57.066
And then he'd trip,
of course.

48:57.099 --> 48:58.400
And then
we would be like,

48:58.434 --> 49:00.035
"Rogers, you can't trip
all over our things.

49:00.068 --> 49:01.371
This is
a very upscale bedroom.

49:01.403 --> 49:02.872
You're working
for two princesses.

49:02.905 --> 49:04.206
Don't get our things wet."

49:04.240 --> 49:05.976
And so he'd come on the bed
and he'd go,

49:06.008 --> 49:07.309
"I'm so sorry. Rogers has
just had a horrible day.

49:07.343 --> 49:09.613
Very busy in the kitchen."

49:09.646 --> 49:11.514
And he'd come sit down and he'd show us
his little array of different flavors.

49:11.546 --> 49:14.316
He'd go, "there's one
that's hibiscus, hydrangea.

49:14.349 --> 49:18.287
There's a Berry bliss
and a mandarin orange flavor.

49:18.320 --> 49:19.288
Which one
are you feeling?

49:19.322 --> 49:20.957
And we'd pick a flavor.

49:20.990 --> 49:22.225
And of course we'd have
to fake that flavor and go,

49:22.258 --> 49:23.593
"it's so good.

49:23.626 --> 49:25.495
Rogers.
We love when you make us tea."

49:25.528 --> 49:27.430
And he'd sit there and we'd kind
of talk about our days

49:27.463 --> 49:29.499
just, I don't know,
school or just hanging out.

49:29.532 --> 49:30.901
Or what we were up to.

49:30.934 --> 49:32.269
And then at the end,
he would go,

49:32.302 --> 49:33.403
"all right,
well, Rogers is off the clock.

49:33.436 --> 49:34.905
It's been a very busy day.

49:34.938 --> 49:36.171
My two little princesses
fall asleep now."

49:36.204 --> 49:37.606
And he'd kind of walk
out of the room

49:37.639 --> 49:40.242
and gather up his tea set
and trip on the way out.

49:40.276 --> 49:41.912
And we'd go, "Rogers, you're
getting our things wet."

49:41.945 --> 49:43.345
He'd go, "I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry.

49:43.378 --> 49:45.948
Rogers is a very clumsy man.
Thank you. Sorry."

49:45.981 --> 49:47.983
And he'd do that thing
where he pulls his head back.

49:48.017 --> 49:49.452
"Sorry.
I'm being pulled.

49:49.485 --> 49:51.320
I'm being summoned
by my housekeeper."

49:54.122 --> 49:55.691
-Man.
-And that's it, that's my story.

49:55.724 --> 49:57.627
I wish Rogers was real.

50:26.389 --> 50:28.124
You do know like
two or three people

50:28.157 --> 50:30.293
are gonna show up
tonight, right?

50:30.325 --> 50:33.162
Yeah... yep.

50:36.231 --> 50:37.500
Foti fotat.

50:46.275 --> 50:48.711
Foti fotat.

51:23.613 --> 51:25.281
-That was beautiful.
-That's nice, that's nice.

51:25.314 --> 51:27.350
-I love it. Don't stop.
-Nice, nice, nice.

51:27.383 --> 51:28.785
-So cool.
-So pretty, Brian.

51:28.818 --> 51:30.285
Wonderful.

51:30.318 --> 51:33.188
So I was thinking
about, "boy" and

51:33.222 --> 51:35.624
I'm not sure that we should
go with the intro first.

51:35.657 --> 51:38.394
I think we should try
to pick up from the verse.

51:38.427 --> 51:39.795
-Okay.
-Where we just start with the verse.

51:39.829 --> 51:42.032
-Yeah. Instead of just going...
-Right on the vocal.

51:42.064 --> 51:43.700
Yeah, I think it
kind of hits harder.

51:43.733 --> 51:44.767
A little bit
more emotion.

51:44.800 --> 51:46.268
-Okay, cool.
-Now...

51:46.302 --> 51:49.171
So one, two, three, four.

51:56.244 --> 51:57.713
I like that.

52:04.220 --> 52:05.388
Nice.

52:23.238 --> 52:24.441
Right into the chorus.

52:39.255 --> 52:40.756
One more time.

52:54.403 --> 52:55.839
Nice.

52:55.872 --> 52:57.307
We changed that melody
actually going up.

52:58.773 --> 52:59.923
-Which I think is better.
-It's better.

52:59.924 --> 53:01.492
Okay. Okay. Cool.

53:01.493 --> 53:03.240
I don't know why, we just...
it's not on the record.

53:03.241 --> 53:04.680
-But who cares.
-Yeah, whatever.

53:04.713 --> 53:06.315
But that's
the good thing about live,

53:06.349 --> 53:08.151
is that you can do
whatever you want.

53:08.184 --> 53:10.452
-It doesn't have to be like the record.
-Yeah, yeah.

53:10.485 --> 53:11.787
And then not doing the intro
I think helped, as well.

53:11.788 --> 53:12.221
I think so too.

53:12.255 --> 53:14.224
-Yeah, you know what I mean?
-The energy immediately goes up.

53:14.256 --> 53:16.325
And regardless of where
we place it in a set,

53:16.358 --> 53:18.694
that doesn't affect anything
that it just goes right away.

53:18.727 --> 53:20.061
No, you just don't
say anything for it.

53:20.062 --> 53:20.729
Just a count off.

53:20.762 --> 53:21.696
You just go right
in from another song.

53:21.697 --> 53:22.164
Okay, cool, yeah.

53:22.197 --> 53:24.233
-No.
-From the top, one more time.

53:24.267 --> 53:25.293
I mean, even if I'm trying
to think what would be a...

53:25.294 --> 53:25.635
Okay.

53:25.668 --> 53:27.637
You know even ending
on a "hothouse" ending

53:27.669 --> 53:28.838
and then going right into this
would be really pretty.

53:28.871 --> 53:30.372
-Yeah, that would.
-Yeah.

53:30.405 --> 53:31.907
'Cause in rehearsal
it didn't... it felt good

53:31.941 --> 53:33.743
but it felt too relaxed
or something to intro it.

53:33.776 --> 53:34.878
-It was kinda disjointed.
-Like it was, okay good night.

53:34.910 --> 53:37.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:37.313 --> 53:38.689
Okay. Let's start it
from there one more time.

53:38.690 --> 53:39.148
All right here...

53:39.182 --> 53:41.151
Here we go.
One, two, three, four.

53:47.756 --> 53:49.559
Nice.

54:29.231 --> 54:31.200
Nice. Again.

54:44.380 --> 54:48.218
Nice. Now break down,
break down the hook.

55:03.599 --> 55:05.401
Nice.

55:20.015 --> 55:22.651
-And into the bridge, right?
-And into the bridge.

55:38.534 --> 55:41.938
You can tell when somebody
is like vibing on your man.

55:41.970 --> 55:42.699
Like you know what I mean?

55:42.700 --> 55:43.905
-Yeah, that's like...
-Yeah, that's true.

55:43.939 --> 55:44.907
You're kinda like,

55:44.939 --> 55:46.309
"yeah, like you're friends,

55:46.342 --> 55:48.510
but like she
would go for it."

55:48.543 --> 55:50.012
-And that's... and I know.
-Yeah, right. That's weird.

55:50.046 --> 55:52.314
-And mama knows.
-"Mama knows?"

55:52.347 --> 55:53.882
"Mama knows.
Mama knows best."

55:53.916 --> 55:55.918
Mama knows
and mama doesn't like that.

55:55.950 --> 55:58.287
Has that ever happened to you,
like personally?

55:58.320 --> 56:01.590
The guy that I was supposed
to lose my virginity to...

56:01.624 --> 56:02.725
-Supposed to!
-Supposed to!

56:02.758 --> 56:04.660
-My...
-In my house.

56:04.693 --> 56:05.794
-Like it was very, it was planned...
-i planned it out.

56:05.827 --> 56:07.530
-My room.
-I planned it out.

56:07.563 --> 56:09.465
I kind of did do that
but then...

56:09.497 --> 56:11.867
No, my best friend actually
had sex with him

56:11.901 --> 56:13.836
underneath my nose, twice!

56:13.869 --> 56:15.604
No, sweetheart.

56:15.637 --> 56:17.539
The girls
are here for you

56:17.572 --> 56:19.341
just as much
as for your sister.

56:19.374 --> 56:20.709
-They're your friends, too.
-That's I think what it is.

56:20.742 --> 56:22.378
Sometimes I feel like
we're just like a unit.

56:22.410 --> 56:24.447
Like you get one,
you get the other.

56:24.479 --> 56:25.814
But do you think... some
people don't want the other.

56:25.847 --> 56:27.516
See, I think
it's coming from you.

56:27.550 --> 56:29.785
I think other people perceive
you as a separate thing.

56:29.818 --> 56:32.621
You are not your sister, you're
not an extension of your sister.

56:32.655 --> 56:36.793
You're you. You're this glorious,
talented, beautiful girl.

56:36.825 --> 56:38.760
And I think that's
what people see, honey.

56:38.793 --> 56:41.430
Yeah.

56:41.463 --> 56:43.999
Of course, I'm in here
with mom in the bathroom.

56:44.032 --> 56:46.435
What could be better?

56:46.468 --> 56:47.765
Had sex with her the
night before and was

56:47.766 --> 56:48.970
about to have sex
with her that night.

56:49.003 --> 56:51.106
-No.
-My god.

56:51.139 --> 56:53.342
No, no, nothing with me.
We made out, I was like...

56:53.376 --> 56:54.811
were you
devastated?

56:54.843 --> 56:56.378
But you weren't like
official yet?

56:56.412 --> 56:58.514
No, we were official.
He fully cheated on me.

56:58.546 --> 57:00.682
Were you devastated?

57:00.715 --> 57:02.517
Yeah, but I was so mad at
him because she told me...

57:02.518 --> 57:03.118
Obviously...

57:03.151 --> 57:06.521
-This ended the friendship.
-No. It ended the relationship.

57:06.555 --> 57:09.792
She told me in the car
and she's like...

57:09.825 --> 57:12.061
the way she did it
was so creepy...

57:12.093 --> 57:13.729
and she looked at me
and she's like,

57:13.762 --> 57:16.465
and she was the driver,
I didn't have a license yet,

57:16.499 --> 57:18.434
and she's just like,
"I had sex with Richard."

57:18.467 --> 57:20.135
And she was smiling.

57:20.168 --> 57:22.637
She was like, "perfect.
She played right into it.

57:22.671 --> 57:25.140
And like he was like crying,
it was very sad.

57:25.173 --> 57:27.409
-He cried?
-Yeah, he was very upset.

57:27.443 --> 57:30.046
-Well, why the fuck did he do it?
-Exactly.

57:30.079 --> 57:32.548
Because he's just a stupid man.
Motherfucker.

57:32.581 --> 57:34.984
I mean, he had like
played like this like...

57:34.985 --> 57:35.785
I'm sorry.

57:35.818 --> 57:37.520
Remember, John,

57:37.552 --> 57:41.423
"share, care,
and beware."

57:44.427 --> 57:46.829
You got this.

57:46.861 --> 57:48.497
Thanks, babe.

57:50.832 --> 57:55.604
John brought Susan to the party
against my sister's wishes.

57:55.637 --> 57:58.140
Sometimes "John" feels better
than saying "dad."

58:10.586 --> 58:11.788
Hey, man.

58:16.624 --> 58:17.893
What's up?

58:19.628 --> 58:20.863
Hi, Syd.

58:23.032 --> 58:24.633
-Joy.
-Do you like my coat?

58:24.666 --> 58:25.668
-I love it.
-Thank you.

58:42.218 --> 58:44.053
Come on, take it off.

58:44.086 --> 58:45.121
Why are you doing this?
It's cold.

58:45.153 --> 58:46.688
I brought
a water slide.

58:46.722 --> 58:49.091
-Water slide?
-You brought a water slide?

58:49.124 --> 58:49.769
Yes, I brought a water slide.

58:49.770 --> 58:51.060
Sorry, tight arms. You
got me too small of a size.

58:51.093 --> 58:52.595
-Where are you gonna put a water slide?
-What the hell?

58:55.631 --> 58:57.700
Books are different.

58:57.733 --> 58:59.135
Yeah.

59:03.639 --> 59:05.907
You wanna show me
around?

59:05.941 --> 59:07.176
Yeah.

59:07.209 --> 59:10.146
I'll show you
some other new things.

59:12.213 --> 59:14.851
Here's my room.

59:14.883 --> 59:15.985
It's lovely.

59:16.017 --> 59:18.954
Don't need
to see that.

59:18.988 --> 59:21.858
Come on, you pussies,
do a shot with me.

59:21.890 --> 59:24.494
i haven't
even seen them.

59:24.526 --> 59:25.994
Give them a break.

59:26.028 --> 59:27.997
I was at pumpkin carving thing
a couple years ago.

59:28.030 --> 59:29.798
The pumpkin
carving party.

59:29.831 --> 59:31.032
-Yeah. Dan was there.
-That was so painful.

59:31.066 --> 59:32.535
I wasn't invited
to a pumpkin carving...

59:32.568 --> 59:34.537
That's 'cause only
two of us showed up.

59:34.570 --> 59:36.138
Don't get all butthurt about the
pumpkin carving party, okay?

59:36.171 --> 59:38.073
What... you didn't even know
them until like a year ago.

59:38.106 --> 59:39.541
-A year and a half ago.
-We go back.

59:39.575 --> 59:40.943
-We're the old friends.
-We're old school.

59:40.976 --> 59:42.111
-You're new school.
-Well, you know what?

59:42.144 --> 59:44.213
Who goes back,
me and Lynn.

59:44.246 --> 59:46.148
-Don't get me started on Lynn.
-We go way, way back.

59:46.180 --> 59:47.749
No, you can't
claim this woman

59:47.782 --> 59:48.985
-this woman has known me...
-No, she's mine.

59:49.017 --> 59:50.820
Since I was a toddler
practically.

59:50.852 --> 59:52.287
Nice.

59:52.320 --> 59:54.756
-Those are dudes'.
-Those are lady boxers.

59:54.789 --> 59:58.561
I mean, really...
Yes.

59:58.593 --> 01:00:01.063
Look,
all you have to do,

01:00:01.095 --> 01:00:03.832
is try my slide
and I'll leave you alone.

01:00:03.865 --> 01:00:05.534
You actually found
my favorite suit.

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:10.039
Believe it or not.
Turn around.

01:00:10.072 --> 01:00:12.974
By the way, I hear you have a
new little man in your life.

01:00:13.008 --> 01:00:14.710
Yeah, I do.

01:00:14.742 --> 01:00:16.111
You guys would love him.

01:00:16.144 --> 01:00:18.880
He's super grounded,
super down to earth.

01:00:18.914 --> 01:00:20.682
He he wishes
he could be here.

01:00:20.715 --> 01:00:22.784
-Where is he tonight?
-He had to work.

01:00:22.818 --> 01:00:24.653
How long
you guys been dating?

01:00:24.686 --> 01:00:25.987
It's been
a little while.

01:00:26.021 --> 01:00:27.189
-Yeah?
-All right.

01:00:27.222 --> 01:00:29.825
-Fun.
-Hey, where are the girls?

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:34.196
-My god.
-What? I've barely seen them.

01:00:34.229 --> 01:00:37.198
I think Joy
is in her room.

01:00:37.231 --> 01:00:39.235
Well, you know,
I will go and get them out.

01:00:39.267 --> 01:00:41.570
But before I do,
does anybody want...

01:00:41.604 --> 01:00:43.072
What?

01:00:44.372 --> 01:00:45.775
-A smoke?
-Coming in hot.

01:00:45.807 --> 01:00:48.110
This is why
I love you, Lynn.

01:00:48.142 --> 01:00:50.612
You're the coolest mom
of all time.

01:00:50.646 --> 01:00:51.191
I wish my mom was like you.

01:00:51.192 --> 01:00:52.281
A little present, a
little present from mommy.

01:00:52.314 --> 01:00:54.984
I thought I was the only one who
brought crack to this party.

01:00:55.017 --> 01:00:56.752
Apparently not.

01:00:56.785 --> 01:00:58.020
I'm in good company.

01:00:58.052 --> 01:01:00.055
-No peeking.
-All right.

01:01:00.088 --> 01:01:03.224
-Okay. Very good. My... okay.
-Move the long hair, just a little bit.

01:01:03.258 --> 01:01:04.727
All right. Okay.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:06.062
A little precaution.

01:01:06.095 --> 01:01:08.798
Put up the shield
of protection.

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:10.131
Shield?

01:01:10.164 --> 01:01:11.199
Are you kidding me
with the double doors?

01:01:11.233 --> 01:01:12.834
Why am I
turned around then?

01:01:12.867 --> 01:01:14.169
Because,
it's important to me.

01:01:14.202 --> 01:01:16.072
No, no, no, no, no.
We're making a deal.

01:01:16.104 --> 01:01:18.907
Now this is
definitely your bed.

01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:21.276
Yes,
do you like the new artwork?

01:01:21.309 --> 01:01:23.345
-I do.
-Good.

01:01:23.378 --> 01:01:26.348
-It's a nice addition.
-Yeah, I agree.

01:01:26.381 --> 01:01:28.050
Is it a little weird
that it's above my bed?

01:01:28.082 --> 01:01:30.019
No, no.
It's completely normal.

01:01:30.052 --> 01:01:30.561
It's...

01:01:30.562 --> 01:01:32.088
Does that say
something bad about me?

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:34.189
My back has been
bothering me lately.

01:01:34.222 --> 01:01:36.191
No.

01:01:36.224 --> 01:01:37.892
You know what? When you're...
when you're first with somebody

01:01:37.925 --> 01:01:39.961
and like, you just wanna be
doing it all the time.

01:01:39.994 --> 01:01:42.030
And you wanna try
all these new positions.

01:01:42.064 --> 01:01:43.165
And you know...

01:01:43.197 --> 01:01:44.400
Like from the back,

01:01:44.432 --> 01:01:46.001
and with the shoulders
and the hair...

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:47.737
I don't know,
I tweaked something in my hip

01:01:47.769 --> 01:01:49.304
and I got
a little back spasm.

01:01:49.338 --> 01:01:51.006
Shit.
I gotta meet this guy.

01:01:51.039 --> 01:01:52.374
I'm not gonna stop
doing it.

01:01:52.407 --> 01:01:54.043
This place is like camping.
I'm sorry.

01:01:54.075 --> 01:01:55.644
You know
what that means.

01:01:55.677 --> 01:01:57.145
This place is nothing
like camping, though.

01:01:57.178 --> 01:01:58.381
Yes, it is.

01:01:58.414 --> 01:02:00.116
Okay, I'm sorry,
I'm a little spoiled.

01:02:00.148 --> 01:02:03.218
But I do not like bugs,
and creatures, and flies,

01:02:03.251 --> 01:02:04.853
and fucking dead rats

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:06.789
and leaves falling
all over me on the patio.

01:02:06.822 --> 01:02:08.024
That's just how I feel.

01:02:08.057 --> 01:02:09.725
I don't know about you.

01:02:09.758 --> 01:02:13.029
Everyone loves this place.
Yeah, I know they do.

01:02:13.061 --> 01:02:14.863
But we didn't know what we were
getting ourselves into, okay?

01:02:14.896 --> 01:02:16.097
If it was me, I would
still be living out

01:02:16.131 --> 01:02:17.800
in calabasas, right now.

01:02:17.832 --> 01:02:19.135
In the life of luxury.

01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:21.336
Instead,
I'm in a fucking 1920s cottage

01:02:21.369 --> 01:02:23.171
dealing with death
around every corner.

01:02:23.204 --> 01:02:24.239
That is my life.

01:02:25.974 --> 01:02:31.113
Well, trust me, Joy.
You haven't lost anything.

01:02:31.146 --> 01:02:33.716
Really?

01:02:33.749 --> 01:02:35.117
Yeah, really.

01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:37.352
What makes you
say that?

01:02:37.385 --> 01:02:40.288
You might've
even got hotter.

01:02:40.322 --> 01:02:44.860
Happens with age.

01:02:44.892 --> 01:02:47.195
Look, I'll tell you what.
I'll make a deal.

01:02:47.229 --> 01:02:49.765
I won't make a move
on you all night,

01:02:49.798 --> 01:02:51.167
just let me watch.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.968
Does it look like that,

01:02:53.001 --> 01:02:55.104
-or does it look like that?
-Or like that?

01:02:55.137 --> 01:02:56.738
-The latter... no I said...
-So what's the confusion?

01:02:56.771 --> 01:02:58.807
Well, no,
I was pretty sure.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:01.810
I just, you know, I'm always a
little uncertain which is which.

01:03:01.843 --> 01:03:03.979
-So...
-You don't know...

01:03:04.012 --> 01:03:07.541
Like, is circumcised mean
it's been snipped or not?

01:03:07.542 --> 01:03:08.718
Exactly.

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:10.352
But you know
what you are,

01:03:10.385 --> 01:03:12.121
-you just don't know what the word is.
-Right.

01:03:12.153 --> 01:03:14.222
It's like flammable
and inflammable.

01:03:14.256 --> 01:03:16.425
They mean the same thing
actually.

01:03:16.457 --> 01:03:18.727
They both mean flammable.

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.262
-I mean...
-It's tricky though.

01:03:20.294 --> 01:03:23.331
How do you know? You haven't
had to deal with rat death.

01:03:23.365 --> 01:03:25.101
Well, no.
But the smell's lingering.

01:03:25.133 --> 01:03:26.869
I mean,
it's gotta be something.

01:03:26.901 --> 01:03:29.871
-It's gotta be...
-clinging to the clothes?

01:03:29.905 --> 01:03:31.173
-No.
-Maybe.

01:03:31.206 --> 01:03:32.474
Check the rodarte dress.

01:03:32.508 --> 01:03:33.943
Row-dente?

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:35.144
No, rodarte.

01:03:35.177 --> 01:03:36.512
-Okay...
-That one.

01:03:36.544 --> 01:03:38.347
-What does that mean?
-It's just...

01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:40.115
It's a label.
It's a designer person.

01:03:40.148 --> 01:03:41.282
Please.

01:03:41.316 --> 01:03:43.319
No.
No that one on the right.

01:03:43.352 --> 01:03:45.121
On the right.
On the right...

01:03:45.153 --> 01:03:46.121
-Yeah.
-Smell that. Sniff it.

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:48.224
Go...

01:03:48.256 --> 01:03:50.525
-Does it smell bad?
-I don't think so, actually.

01:03:50.559 --> 01:03:52.294
Really? It doesn't?

01:03:52.327 --> 01:03:54.063
Sorry.

01:03:55.463 --> 01:03:57.032
That's good.

01:03:58.432 --> 01:04:00.335
Have a seat.

01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:10.345
Okay.

01:04:10.378 --> 01:04:12.981
We're gonna make it a show
if that's what you want.

01:04:23.492 --> 01:04:25.494
My god.

01:04:25.526 --> 01:04:27.862
It's a miracle.
It's perfect.

01:04:30.131 --> 01:04:32.066
-Happy?
-Yes.

01:04:33.401 --> 01:04:35.137
It's not bad
in here.

01:04:35.169 --> 01:04:37.039
It's not like
your calabasas closet.

01:04:37.072 --> 01:04:40.008
Yeah, hello. This is what it's
like to be a poor person.

01:04:40.041 --> 01:04:43.344
It's not as bad
as your closet, but...

01:04:43.378 --> 01:04:46.816
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:04:54.289 --> 01:04:56.158
-No, I nailed it.
-You did?

01:04:56.191 --> 01:04:58.360
-I did.
-How did you do that?

01:04:58.392 --> 01:05:00.396
Because I was... and I was
reading with him too.

01:05:00.428 --> 01:05:02.331
My... well,
but that's why,

01:05:02.363 --> 01:05:04.066
because he's so good
so you're like...

01:05:04.099 --> 01:05:06.001
The chemistry was there.

01:05:06.034 --> 01:05:08.470
Although like, we were supposed
to be brother and sister.

01:05:08.503 --> 01:05:10.372
But that's okay.

01:05:10.405 --> 01:05:12.240
There's always
that weird dynamic

01:05:12.273 --> 01:05:13.942
-between brother and sisters.
-There's a couple Oscar movies

01:05:13.976 --> 01:05:15.945
that have touched
on that issue I think.

01:05:15.977 --> 01:05:19.481
-Issue?
-Yeah the... issue.

01:05:19.514 --> 01:05:21.383
Incest is best.

01:05:21.416 --> 01:05:24.019
Actually, I used to...
They... there's a...

01:05:24.052 --> 01:05:25.588
-there's a...
-incest is best.

01:05:25.621 --> 01:05:27.555
Put your sibling
to the test.

01:05:27.588 --> 01:05:28.490
There, no...
Really.

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:19.275
-Did you ever find them?
-Yeah. They're coming.

01:07:15.463 --> 01:07:17.166
Okay, you saw
this coming.

01:07:17.198 --> 01:07:19.434
But when John arrived
at the party,

01:07:19.468 --> 01:07:22.438
Joy was so surprised
to see Susan standing there

01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:24.706
that she fell down.

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.542
Hi, dad.

01:07:26.575 --> 01:07:28.577
Hey, sweetie...

01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:33.215
I don't know about the water
slide out here at night.

01:07:33.247 --> 01:07:35.985
It wasn't
our idea, I promise.

01:07:36.017 --> 01:07:38.220
-Here you go, I know you like purple.
-Thank you.

01:07:38.253 --> 01:07:40.189
-Yeah. Hey, Joy.
-Hi.

01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:42.591
-Hi.
-Joy, this is susie, Susan.

01:07:42.624 --> 01:07:45.561
-This is... This is Joy.
-Hi.

01:07:45.593 --> 01:07:47.563
-Hello.
-I've heard so much about you.

01:07:47.595 --> 01:07:49.030
-Thank you. Sorry, I'm kinda wet.
-Nice to meet you.

01:07:49.064 --> 01:07:50.466
Nice to meet you.

01:07:50.499 --> 01:07:52.034
It's not nice
what happened next.

01:07:52.066 --> 01:07:54.369
Let's skip ahead
and just say this.

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:56.171
Susan stayed in the car.

01:07:56.204 --> 01:07:57.706
John went inside.

01:07:57.738 --> 01:08:02.510
And Joy went upstairs
to change back into her dress.

01:08:20.828 --> 01:08:22.096
Can you get the back?

01:08:44.652 --> 01:08:49.057
-Is it weird seeing him?
-I mean...

01:08:49.090 --> 01:08:50.291
I mean, yeah,
it was like awkward

01:08:50.325 --> 01:08:51.827
when I came down
like the steps.

01:08:51.859 --> 01:08:54.328
It was weird
because you know when you like

01:08:54.362 --> 01:08:57.131
still have that...

01:08:57.165 --> 01:08:58.567
That rapport or that...

01:08:58.599 --> 01:09:00.736
-Right.
-I don't know, it's like...

01:09:00.768 --> 01:09:03.638
It kind of floods back
all of a sudden.

01:09:03.671 --> 01:09:06.442
So you kind
of miss him...

01:09:06.474 --> 01:09:08.544
-Yeah.
-You have feelings for him still.

01:09:08.576 --> 01:09:11.078
-You're like, yes...
-Yeah.

01:09:11.112 --> 01:09:12.380
Sometimes you need it
from a man.

01:09:12.413 --> 01:09:13.682
You know what I mean?

01:09:13.714 --> 01:09:15.082
It's like...
And then he blamed it on,

01:09:15.116 --> 01:09:16.084
"well you're just close
to your mom.

01:09:16.117 --> 01:09:17.685
You know
what I mean?

01:09:17.719 --> 01:09:18.687
That's all you, you guys
are like three musketeers.

01:09:18.719 --> 01:09:20.188
And you leave me out."

01:09:20.221 --> 01:09:23.157
And it's like,
no, like, I love my dad.

01:09:23.191 --> 01:09:25.227
You know, I wanna be
in a relationship with him.

01:09:40.241 --> 01:09:42.643
But did you see
her dress?

01:09:42.676 --> 01:09:45.481
-It was so ugly.
-I know.

01:09:45.513 --> 01:09:46.881
-It looked like...
-That thing was offensive.

01:09:46.915 --> 01:09:49.185
Palm Springs meets Vegas.

01:09:55.857 --> 01:10:00.429
-Hey, dada.
-Sweetie.

01:10:00.461 --> 01:10:02.531
Hey, how are ya.

01:10:02.563 --> 01:10:05.666
Look
at you creatures.

01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:08.237
Look at you.

01:10:08.269 --> 01:10:09.871
What's going on here?

01:10:09.905 --> 01:10:12.241
What is that?
I almost let you kiss me.

01:10:12.273 --> 01:10:13.642
What? What's wrong?

01:10:13.674 --> 01:10:16.512
-It's okay, okay sweetie.
-What happened?

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:17.813
I think she just
threw up in her face.

01:10:17.845 --> 01:10:18.813
Dad said it looked like
she was...

01:10:18.847 --> 01:10:20.314
Honey.

01:10:20.348 --> 01:10:22.451
Yeah, here.
There's some on the floor.

01:10:22.483 --> 01:10:25.419
Honey.

01:10:25.452 --> 01:10:29.423
That smells
like bleach.

01:10:29.456 --> 01:10:31.259
-Really?
-No, this is cum.

01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:32.460
What?

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:34.429
That's not...
No, that's not possible.

01:10:34.461 --> 01:10:35.763
Where's my shotglass?

01:10:35.796 --> 01:10:36.932
Dad brought Susan.

01:10:36.964 --> 01:10:38.534
Dad what?

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:39.701
He fucking brought Susan.
I'm gonna lose it.

01:10:39.733 --> 01:10:40.936
I'm gonna pass
the fuck out.

01:10:42.403 --> 01:10:44.339
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where is she?

01:10:44.371 --> 01:10:45.706
Outside. In the car.
Past the gate.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:46.808
I told him
if he brought her in

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:48.477
that he wasn't
my dad anymore.

01:10:48.509 --> 01:10:50.445
-Okay. That's great.
-My god.

01:10:50.478 --> 01:10:51.747
-All right...
-I'm so hot.

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.447
I'm just...
It's fine, it's no big deal.

01:10:53.481 --> 01:10:55.483
Elle, everything okay?

01:10:55.517 --> 01:10:57.719
Elle, why the hell
is there cum on the floor?

01:10:57.751 --> 01:10:59.254
-My god.
-There's what?

01:10:59.286 --> 01:11:01.255
What the fuck?

01:11:01.289 --> 01:11:03.592
-There's what?
-My god.

01:11:03.625 --> 01:11:05.761
Wait, wait.

01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:07.763
-I'm sorry.
-Hold on. Hold the fuckin' phone.

01:11:07.795 --> 01:11:09.630
-There's cum on the floor?
-That's not really cum, right?

01:11:09.664 --> 01:11:11.332
-It does look like cum.
-It is.

01:11:11.366 --> 01:11:12.668
What?

01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:14.303
-What?
-That's fucking cum?

01:11:14.335 --> 01:11:16.304
-My god.
-That's fucking cum?

01:11:16.338 --> 01:11:18.974
-What the fuck?
-I don't know. Maybe the dog came.

01:11:19.006 --> 01:11:20.842
What the fuck?

01:11:20.875 --> 01:11:23.245
You... you two... when the hell
did this fuckin' happen?

01:11:23.277 --> 01:11:24.713
Not me.

01:11:24.745 --> 01:11:26.714
Elle wasn't wearing panties,
and it leaked out.

01:11:26.747 --> 01:11:28.250
Wasn't wearing pant... okay.

01:11:28.282 --> 01:11:29.584
Thank you, Reed.
Thank you.

01:11:29.617 --> 01:11:30.919
-Thank you for that.
-Shit happens.

01:11:30.951 --> 01:11:32.720
We understand
how that happened.

01:11:32.754 --> 01:11:34.256
-You weren't wearing a condom?
-Yeah, I mean,

01:11:34.289 --> 01:11:35.857
your dad would never
even have sex with me

01:11:35.889 --> 01:11:39.695
-if he didn't have a condom.
-Okay, mom, stop.

01:11:39.728 --> 01:11:41.697
You get the fuck out
of here.

01:11:41.729 --> 01:11:42.187
Okay, I'm gone.

01:11:42.188 --> 01:11:43.564
You just go. Get some
panties on, harlot.

01:11:43.598 --> 01:11:45.434
-Really, Reed?
-What's with not wearing a condom?

01:11:45.467 --> 01:11:47.302
What...

01:11:47.335 --> 01:11:48.804
-what is wrong with you?
-That smell...

01:11:48.836 --> 01:11:50.805
My god.

01:11:50.839 --> 01:11:52.341
You really...

01:11:52.374 --> 01:11:53.976
Have to be
more responsible.

01:11:54.009 --> 01:11:55.510
I'm sure she's on
the pill, but what?

01:11:55.543 --> 01:11:57.478
You wanna get
herpes from her?

01:11:57.512 --> 01:11:58.847
-I don't know if she has herpes or not.
-Mom, stop it.

01:11:58.879 --> 01:12:00.548
She doesn't have herpes.
You're embarrassing him.

01:12:00.581 --> 01:12:02.351
Well, you know, you wear
condoms for a reason.

01:12:04.419 --> 01:12:07.389
-Ahem... after you.
-Thanks.

01:12:07.421 --> 01:12:09.558
I'm actually just gonna
wait out here for a friend.

01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:11.727
It's not 'cause
I have a sword, right?

01:12:11.759 --> 01:12:14.729
It's not real.
It's...

01:12:14.763 --> 01:12:17.265
It's actually for wine.

01:12:17.299 --> 01:12:18.867
-Awesome.
-Dan.

01:12:20.067 --> 01:12:22.036
Cool.

01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:25.040
John's girlfriend Susan
had told her friends

01:12:25.072 --> 01:12:27.575
that she was planning
to spend more time together

01:12:27.608 --> 01:12:30.044
with John's family.

01:12:30.077 --> 01:12:33.482
They wanted proof before they
would support the relationship.

01:12:35.817 --> 01:12:36.818
Selfie.

01:12:38.385 --> 01:12:40.888
That was so slutty of you.
I'm embarrassed.

01:12:40.921 --> 01:12:43.025
And who changes?

01:12:43.058 --> 01:12:44.893
Who changes right here in front of
this open door for everyone to see?

01:12:44.925 --> 01:12:46.762
And who designed
this piece of shit?

01:12:46.795 --> 01:12:48.764
Who... I mean,
it's literally open windows.

01:12:48.796 --> 01:12:51.633
Hi. Hi, I'm naked.
Hello.

01:12:51.665 --> 01:12:53.968
-I don't get it.
-Okay, very funny.

01:12:54.001 --> 01:12:55.504
What are you...
What are you doing in here?

01:12:55.536 --> 01:12:56.905
Are you getting
all freshened up?

01:12:56.937 --> 01:12:58.372
Are you about to go round two?
What's going on?

01:12:58.406 --> 01:12:59.875
-Yeah, I am,
-I mean, Lacey panties.

01:12:59.907 --> 01:13:01.709
What...
What're you doing?

01:13:01.742 --> 01:13:03.077
This is the time where you
get comfortable now, right?

01:13:03.111 --> 01:13:04.780
You already had sex.
We get it, okay.

01:13:04.812 --> 01:13:06.480
You trailed your business
all over the floor.

01:13:06.513 --> 01:13:08.382
We understand
what happened.

01:13:08.415 --> 01:13:08.765
Right?

01:13:08.766 --> 01:13:09.817
No, I did not trail
all over the floor.

01:13:09.851 --> 01:13:11.987
-It was in one spot.
-That we know of.

01:13:12.019 --> 01:13:13.688
Who knows what dad saw.
Who knows what he heard.

01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:15.857
Dad didn't see anything.
He already left.

01:13:15.889 --> 01:13:17.659
No, he didn't.

01:13:17.692 --> 01:13:18.994
He's still
fucking here?

01:13:19.027 --> 01:13:21.363
No...
Unless the man out there

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:22.863
is... is...
Is not my father.

01:13:22.897 --> 01:13:24.499
Get the broseph
to fucking leave.

01:13:24.531 --> 01:13:25.800
He won't. And she's
still out here, too.

01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:27.469
She's on the fucking
street in the car.

01:13:27.501 --> 01:13:29.470
-Susan's still down here?
-Yes, she was smoking.

01:13:29.504 --> 01:13:31.340
Okay, well,
what just happened, actually,

01:13:31.372 --> 01:13:32.808
should have made him leave.
So, there you go.

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.976
You got anything left
to trail around?

01:13:35.009 --> 01:13:37.679
Actually, yeah, I could
fucking squeeze it out for you.

01:13:37.711 --> 01:13:39.348
-My god.
-You weirdo.

01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:40.948
Okay, all right, we're done.
We can't...

01:13:40.982 --> 01:13:42.884
I can't talk about your
sexual activity anymore.

01:13:42.916 --> 01:13:44.753
-Were you safe?
-Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

01:13:44.786 --> 01:13:46.855
What does he hate?
He hates movies.

01:13:46.888 --> 01:13:48.590
-He hates movies...
-He hates movies.

01:13:48.622 --> 01:13:49.924
Well, that's a natural thing
to put on at a party.

01:13:49.957 --> 01:13:51.793
We're too loud.
We're too fucking loud.

01:13:51.826 --> 01:13:53.862
-Animated movies he hates.
-He hates animated movies.

01:13:53.894 --> 01:13:55.530
And he hates
subtitled films.

01:13:55.562 --> 01:13:56.831
If we put them on,
it'll give him a headache.

01:13:56.865 --> 01:13:58.700
-Perfect.
-Will other people leave?

01:13:58.732 --> 01:14:00.568
-Shit.
-What if our friends leave?

01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:02.070
By the way, a shit ton
of people showed up.

01:14:02.103 --> 01:14:04.439
-I know they did.
-You, me, mom, dad.

01:14:04.472 --> 01:14:07.608
-Alice, Lauren, Reed...
-You can't count us. We live here.

01:14:07.642 --> 01:14:09.778
Fuck, wait, hold on.
Yeah, we can.

01:14:09.811 --> 01:14:11.813
You came.
You came twice.

01:14:11.845 --> 01:14:14.148
Very funny.
Hold on. Brian...

01:14:14.182 --> 01:14:15.883
You have to go pee?
Why are you like that?

01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:16.451
A little bit.

01:14:16.483 --> 01:14:17.451
You have to pee after sex.

01:14:17.485 --> 01:14:18.687
I haven't done it yet.

01:14:18.719 --> 01:14:20.554
Hold on.
The landlords.

01:14:20.588 --> 01:14:21.790
They count. They're
still in our territory.

01:14:21.822 --> 01:14:23.424
-The landlords.
-Yeah, yeah.

01:14:23.457 --> 01:14:25.427
-They count.
-Wait. Do we count Susan?

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.596
Sure, count Susan.
Yeah, yeah, she's here.

01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:29.631
She's on the street, we didn't
even let her in the house.

01:14:29.664 --> 01:14:30.276
Susan, the landlords...

01:14:30.277 --> 01:14:31.500
You don't fucking count
Susan, you dumbass!

01:14:31.532 --> 01:14:33.000
-You're a fucking dumbass.
-Now, hurry up.

01:14:33.034 --> 01:14:34.536
Shut up.

01:14:34.568 --> 01:14:36.670
No more slutty behavior.
That was disgusting.

01:14:40.707 --> 01:14:41.942
You weirdo.

01:14:41.976 --> 01:14:43.577
This is open.
Anyone could do that.

01:14:43.611 --> 01:14:44.845
-I know it is!
-Potentially, anyone could...

01:14:44.879 --> 01:14:46.680
-Shuffle.
-Shuffled. He did it.

01:14:46.714 --> 01:14:49.551
So basically there's
townspeople and there's mafia.

01:14:49.584 --> 01:14:51.052
There's more
townspeople than mafia.

01:14:51.085 --> 01:14:53.855
You have to figure out
who the mafia are.

01:14:53.888 --> 01:14:56.024
-Preach it.
-Everyday you wake up

01:14:56.057 --> 01:14:58.026
-and then you go back to sleep.
-I don't understand...

01:14:58.058 --> 01:14:59.561
I'm not gonna
be able to do this.

01:14:59.594 --> 01:15:01.096
The card picks
who's what.

01:15:01.129 --> 01:15:04.633
So, so basically the mafia
has to lie to everyone else

01:15:04.665 --> 01:15:06.500
and tell them
they're not the mafia.

01:15:06.534 --> 01:15:07.835
And then if they get
to the end of the game

01:15:07.869 --> 01:15:09.704
and nobody discovers
they are the mafia,

01:15:09.737 --> 01:15:11.173
-then they win.
-Also...

01:15:11.205 --> 01:15:13.974
So they basically
have to lie and deceive and...

01:15:14.008 --> 01:15:15.477
Your dad would probably be
pretty good at this.

01:15:17.144 --> 01:15:19.481
-That's probably true.
-That's true. He would.

01:15:21.915 --> 01:15:24.585
He lied to us for
fucking, what, 20, 25 years.

01:15:24.619 --> 01:15:26.955
If I was in the mafia,
I wouldn't want to be

01:15:26.987 --> 01:15:28.622
adopted by your dad,
though, 'cause...

01:15:28.656 --> 01:15:30.091
It's
a really good game.

01:15:30.124 --> 01:15:31.960
Could you come here?

01:15:37.098 --> 01:15:38.066
Dad, wait. Wait.

01:15:38.098 --> 01:15:39.467
-Wait.
-Look.

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:40.802
This is all about Susan,
all right?

01:15:40.835 --> 01:15:42.671
You shouldn't have
fuckin' brought her.

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:43.170
We told you not to.

01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:44.104
Daddy, you've done
this multiple times.

01:15:44.138 --> 01:15:45.707
-All the time, uninvited.
-You never let me

01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:47.209
introduce this woman
to you. Okay?

01:15:47.241 --> 01:15:49.177
-She's the woman in my life.
-She's not invited.

01:15:49.210 --> 01:15:51.613
-You need to accept...
-This is the woman you were with

01:15:51.646 --> 01:15:54.215
when you were with our mother.
We will not respect her.

01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:55.784
I never hurt your mother
on purpose, ever.

01:15:55.817 --> 01:15:57.719
Okay? You have no idea
what was happening.

01:15:57.751 --> 01:15:59.254
You always make it
like we're the bad guy.

01:15:59.286 --> 01:16:00.655
You have no idea
the things that she said.

01:16:00.687 --> 01:16:01.789
The things that she would say.

01:16:01.822 --> 01:16:03.525
Okay, I never touched her.

01:16:03.558 --> 01:16:05.060
I was never physical with her.
Ever! I never hit her.

01:16:05.093 --> 01:16:07.262
-That's a given!
-That's not the point.

01:16:07.295 --> 01:16:09.564
You're not supposed to be physical
as a husband. You two talk to me

01:16:09.597 --> 01:16:11.566
-like I'm a subcontractor!
-So you're still emotionally abusive.

01:16:11.598 --> 01:16:13.101
I don't work for you! I don't
work for you! You look at me!

01:16:13.134 --> 01:16:14.669
-Elle!
-Elle, help us out.

01:16:16.670 --> 01:16:17.471
Was I ever physical?

01:16:17.472 --> 01:16:19.073
Who gives a shit if
you would've cussed?

01:16:19.107 --> 01:16:21.142
It would have been a lot
better than what you've done.

01:16:21.174 --> 01:16:22.878
She would call me
a son of a bitch.

01:16:22.911 --> 01:16:24.779
A motherfucker,
every single fucking day.

01:16:24.812 --> 01:16:26.515
Okay? Fuck this, fuck that.

01:16:26.548 --> 01:16:28.116
-She had a mouth like a sailor.
-Mom?

01:16:28.148 --> 01:16:30.919
I wish you would have cussed
her out all the fucking time...

01:16:30.951 --> 01:16:32.119
-Okay. Really?
-It would have been way better

01:16:32.152 --> 01:16:33.722
than fucking another woman, dad.

01:16:38.726 --> 01:16:41.963
I wish you would have fucking
swore at our whole family.

01:16:41.995 --> 01:16:45.866
Cause at the end of the day,
that shit doesn't matter.

01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:48.269
We're a family we're gonna
fucking do those things,

01:16:48.303 --> 01:16:49.970
but you don't fuck
another woman.

01:16:50.004 --> 01:16:53.075
That's what you don't do.

01:17:02.817 --> 01:17:04.753
This is so fucking
embarrassing, I'm sorry.

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:06.755
If you knew
my younger sister,

01:17:06.787 --> 01:17:09.790
you'd know this is something
she wouldn't get over,

01:17:09.823 --> 01:17:12.160
honey, it's okay. It's okay.
It's just stressing me out

01:17:12.192 --> 01:17:14.019
and I couldn't stay
much longer, anyway.

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:16.027
I know because I have to
get home and let rivers out.

01:17:16.028 --> 01:17:19.768
Okay sweetie, I'm fine. I'll...
I'll call Lou on the way home,

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.169
-and get it out.
-I...

01:17:23.737 --> 01:17:24.738
Okay, honey.

01:17:24.772 --> 01:17:26.608
It's okay.

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:27.842
We're sorry we didn't...

01:17:27.875 --> 01:17:29.644
I'll see you
in the morning.

01:17:29.677 --> 01:17:31.313
-Okay.
-It's okay. I love you.

01:17:31.345 --> 01:17:33.214
Okay.

01:17:33.246 --> 01:17:35.082
-I love you, baby.
-I love you mom, I'm sorry.

01:17:35.116 --> 01:17:36.751
Don't be sorry.

01:17:36.784 --> 01:17:39.019
It's important,
I think, to say that

01:17:39.053 --> 01:17:42.323
this is the last time Elle and
Joy saw our mother alive.

01:17:46.193 --> 01:17:48.095
When she crashed
into a retaining wall,

01:17:48.129 --> 01:17:52.233
at the base of the canyon
while texting Lou.

01:17:52.265 --> 01:17:55.803
No one at the party heard the sound
reverberate through the canyon.

01:17:55.836 --> 01:17:57.037
At the bottom
of the canyon...

01:17:57.071 --> 01:17:59.006
Mom? Mom!

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.108
The girls didn't
go running down

01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:01.142
to the scene
of the accident.

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:06.648
For a little while,
no one knew but me.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:08.316
you seem to be pointing
it down, though.

01:18:08.348 --> 01:18:09.918
-Don't even worry about that.
-The patio got real small...

01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:11.953
-Well, I'm scared.
-Just right through it.

01:18:11.986 --> 01:18:13.354
This cuts through
something you shouldn't...

01:18:13.388 --> 01:18:14.889
Just go through it.
Just stroke through it.

01:18:14.921 --> 01:18:16.825
It's like a weird scene
in "the notebook."

01:18:16.857 --> 01:18:18.025
It's like a scene
that got cut...

01:18:18.058 --> 01:18:19.326
Shit.

01:18:21.028 --> 01:18:23.130
That was good.

01:18:23.164 --> 01:18:25.032
My god, you took
half the bottle out.

01:18:25.066 --> 01:18:27.135
That was amazing.

01:18:27.168 --> 01:18:29.004
There's no point
in showing you the grief

01:18:29.036 --> 01:18:31.171
Elle and Joy experienced
when they heard the news.

01:18:31.205 --> 01:18:35.677
There's no point in showing
certain things, to anyone.

01:18:37.411 --> 01:18:41.415
We can choose to focus on
other things if we want to.

01:18:41.448 --> 01:18:43.317
It's god's gift.

01:19:23.357 --> 01:19:26.127
Mom was on life support
for several weeks

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:28.162
before they had to decide
to let her go.

01:19:30.897 --> 01:19:33.416
I'd like to tell you
there was a reconciliation

01:19:33.417 --> 01:19:34.969
between Elle,
Joy, and John.

01:19:37.104 --> 01:19:40.340
Sometimes, I imagine how it might
have gone if there had been.

01:19:40.374 --> 01:19:42.711
You know, I really should
be going back to London.

01:19:42.744 --> 01:19:44.278
Is this...
No!

01:19:44.312 --> 01:19:47.148
Shit, it's just
a little too much for me.

01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:48.817
Actually was, a,
a real trip.

01:19:48.849 --> 01:19:51.352
Not fake
like it used to be,

01:19:51.384 --> 01:19:53.287
anyways,
I have some delicious teas

01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:54.789
that are herbal
from the deep,

01:19:54.821 --> 01:19:58.792
dark, forests of...
Bombay,

01:19:58.826 --> 01:19:59.894
you know that place.

01:19:59.927 --> 01:20:02.229
And here
is your lovely tea,

01:20:02.263 --> 01:20:04.099
just a little bit
of it spilled, my dear.

01:20:04.131 --> 01:20:05.500
Let me just get it.

01:20:05.532 --> 01:20:09.838
Some Joy always
replaces the hurt.

01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:13.741
My sisters went back to praying
together like they had in calabasas.

01:20:13.775 --> 01:20:16.076
This especially
pleased my mom.

01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:18.213
She hoped they wouldn't
get married young,

01:20:18.245 --> 01:20:22.249
or stop singing if
they couldn't sell records

01:20:22.282 --> 01:20:24.885
sure, she wasn't on
their patio in the morning,

01:20:24.919 --> 01:20:27.488
or, around to take
their phone calls,

01:20:27.522 --> 01:20:29.823
she couldn't hold
their hands at appointments

01:20:29.857 --> 01:20:32.127
or be there
at their first birth.

01:20:34.228 --> 01:20:36.765
But almost
all of their choices

01:20:36.798 --> 01:20:39.901
could still be
traced to her.

01:20:44.338 --> 01:20:45.907
This image
is of my sisters

01:20:45.939 --> 01:20:49.210
a few months after
my mother died.

01:20:49.242 --> 01:20:52.179
It's my favorite image
of them because

01:20:52.213 --> 01:20:56.550
it's the first time in months
that they smiled.

01:20:56.584 --> 01:20:59.320
I'm not sure why
it happened here.

01:20:59.353 --> 01:21:01.523
But it just did.

01:21:05.358 --> 01:21:07.428
We understand you!

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:08.896
We speak your language!

01:21:13.835 --> 01:21:16.237
You there!

01:22:04.085 --> 01:22:05.854
Turkey was cancelled,

01:22:05.887 --> 01:22:07.155
but their
team managed to set up

01:22:07.187 --> 01:22:10.157
a more lucrative one
in Dubai.

01:22:10.191 --> 01:22:13.862
So, they'd always have
that you know,

01:22:13.894 --> 01:22:17.131
"that time in Dubai."

01:22:46.661 --> 01:22:49.531
They said goodbye to the house like
they were leaving it for good.

01:24:36.403 --> 01:24:37.604
Are we past it?

01:24:43.277 --> 01:24:45.079
We can't keep doing
this every day.

01:25:02.295 --> 01:25:05.098
I love my sisters.

01:25:05.131 --> 01:25:07.736
I love everything
about them.

01:25:13.573 --> 01:25:17.577
This is Elle, at 24.

01:25:17.611 --> 01:25:21.182
This is Joy at, 22.
