00:00.849 --> 00:02.349
<i>Previously on</i> Blue Bloods:

00:03.695 --> 00:05.563
What's going on, kid?

00:09.852 --> 00:11.986
Something you should hear.

00:11.987 --> 00:13.855
JOE
Getting close,

00:13.856 --> 00:16.658
but the Templar
may have made me.

00:16.659 --> 00:17.726
That's Joe.

00:17.727 --> 00:19.060
The night he
was killed.

00:19.061 --> 00:23.364
He was working with the FBI,
investigating the Blue Templar.

00:23.365 --> 00:25.333
What?

00:25.334 --> 00:28.203
I should have told you
a long time ago, Danny.

00:28.204 --> 00:30.205
Does Dad know?

00:30.206 --> 00:32.540
No.

00:40.883 --> 00:44.185
After I broke off
communications with the FBI,

00:44.186 --> 00:45.553
I started looking into the death

00:45.554 --> 00:47.288
of Detective Gonsalves
on my own.

00:47.289 --> 00:48.690
Long story short, she had left

00:48.691 --> 00:52.160
a sort of last testament
with her sister.

00:52.161 --> 00:54.362
Wrote that when she
arrived on the scene,

00:54.363 --> 00:56.965
Detective Malevsky
had killed the two dealers

00:56.966 --> 00:59.701
and then told her
that they had shot Joe.

01:05.241 --> 01:07.275
She didn't believe him,

01:07.276 --> 01:08.676
so the Blue Templar realized

01:08.677 --> 01:10.612
that, clearly,
that made her a liability.

01:12.381 --> 01:15.216
Why didn't you come to us
when all this started?

01:16.252 --> 01:19.220
Because Joe had kept it
from you, I...

01:20.856 --> 01:22.190
...thought maybe
this was something

01:22.191 --> 01:24.025
he left behind
for me to...

01:24.026 --> 01:27.028
carry on, and...

01:29.915 --> 01:32.267
I wanted to honor my brother.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.241
Now I'm in over my head.

01:40.242 --> 01:42.744
I mean, uh...

01:42.745 --> 01:45.613
who the hell are these guys?

01:53.722 --> 01:55.924
We're going in the front.

01:57.426 --> 02:00.595
Copy that.
We're at the fire escape.

02:03.866 --> 02:07.435
After Serpico
and the Knapp Commission

02:07.436 --> 02:10.038
and all the static
that came with it,

02:10.038 --> 02:13.508
we started the Blue Templar as
a way to police the police.

02:13.509 --> 02:16.477
There was a world of hurt
in the ranks

02:16.478 --> 02:18.413
because a few bad apples had...

02:18.414 --> 02:20.415
brought such disgrace
to the whole department.

02:20.416 --> 02:23.184
We thought it would be
a good thing

02:23.185 --> 02:25.186
to have a band of brothers

02:25.187 --> 02:27.789
who kept a lookout
from the inside.

02:29.258 --> 02:31.960
And it served a purpose
for awhile.

02:31.961 --> 02:34.462
We had a good man in I.A.

02:34.463 --> 02:37.165
who appreciated
what we were trying to do.

02:37.166 --> 02:40.001
And we avoided
some potential disasters

02:40.002 --> 02:42.003
from the rank.

02:42.004 --> 02:46.474
But after a while, the...
the core group retired,

02:46.475 --> 02:48.476
and the Templar became

02:48.477 --> 02:50.945
just a bunch of guys
telling war stories

02:50.946 --> 02:53.481
about the bad old days.

02:55.851 --> 02:58.653
I was never much of a joiner.

02:58.654 --> 03:02.123
When I was tapped, there was
some new blood in the Templar.

03:02.124 --> 03:04.959
Thought we could do
some good again.

03:04.960 --> 03:07.295
Just dissolved into
a bunch of blowhards

03:07.296 --> 03:09.030
sitting around
strip clubs

03:09.031 --> 03:10.598
where the girls
know every cop's name

03:10.599 --> 03:13.201
and a bill never shows up
for the drinks.

03:13.202 --> 03:15.403
I got out quick.

03:17.556 --> 03:18.890
Police! Don't move!

03:20.000 --> 03:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:30.452 --> 03:32.820
Come on, come on, come on.

03:35.524 --> 03:37.725
When I came on
as commissioner,

03:37.726 --> 03:41.262
I conducted a thorough review
of all the department's

03:41.263 --> 03:43.498
fraternal organizations
with I.A.,

03:43.499 --> 03:47.068
including the Blue Templar.

03:47.069 --> 03:51.773
I never saw anything
that would cause concern,

03:51.774 --> 03:54.342
much less alarm.

03:56.645 --> 04:00.148
I guess I just saw
what I was supposed to see.

04:07.723 --> 04:10.525
Who was your FBI contact?

04:10.526 --> 04:12.860
A female agent--
Anderson.

04:12.861 --> 04:15.663
She just made it sound like
Joe was working with them.

04:15.664 --> 04:17.265
Anybody else? I.A.?

04:17.266 --> 04:19.100
Lieutenant Bello
interviewed me from I.A.

04:19.101 --> 04:21.269
when I was seen in Chinatown
with Anderson.

04:21.269 --> 04:24.605
She came forward and...
and backed up my... my story.

04:30.346 --> 04:32.213
You lied to I.A.

04:34.817 --> 04:38.252
I didn't know
who knew what. I...

04:39.388 --> 04:42.457
You should have come to me
right away, son.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.934
Yeah.

04:53.769 --> 04:55.503
No, you go ahead.

04:55.504 --> 04:57.238
I'll meet you there.

05:12.554 --> 05:13.638
Hey. What do we got?

05:13.639 --> 05:15.556
Hey. Uh, well, all
four were packing.

05:15.557 --> 05:17.141
None of them
got off a shot.

05:17.142 --> 05:19.594
We got two earwitnesses
that heard some commotion

05:19.595 --> 05:22.797
and then a lot of gunfire
in a short amount of time.

05:22.798 --> 05:24.098
We gathering the shell casings?

05:24.099 --> 05:25.299
Yeah, but both witnesses said

05:25.300 --> 05:26.801
they heard
voices-- plural--

05:26.802 --> 05:29.270
shouting what sounds like,
"Police. Don't move."

05:29.271 --> 05:30.971
Right.
"Police. Don't move,"

05:30.972 --> 05:32.907
but nobody stops
to take a peek, right?

05:32.908 --> 05:34.492
Right, well, in a
building like this,

05:34.493 --> 05:35.643
"Police. Don't move..."

05:35.644 --> 05:38.179
Even the cockroaches
run the other way.

05:39.014 --> 05:41.382
Hey.

05:42.251 --> 05:44.619
Hey.

05:46.522 --> 05:49.357
Hey, look wedged in right there.

05:50.492 --> 05:52.527
See it?

05:52.528 --> 05:54.462
Is that Kevlar?

05:54.463 --> 05:56.664
Yeah, looks like it.

05:59.601 --> 06:02.370
That's a Kevlar glove,
same as the police use.

06:02.371 --> 06:03.571
They're shouting
police commands.

06:03.572 --> 06:04.972
Right. Police
impersonators?

06:04.973 --> 06:06.307
Yeah.

06:06.308 --> 06:08.376
Or maybe, uh, dirty cops.

06:08.377 --> 06:10.778
We had an incident
in Brooklyn South last weekend.

06:10.779 --> 06:12.280
Could be a pattern.

06:12.281 --> 06:14.715
Let's canvass the building.
Okay.

06:18.320 --> 06:19.587
Hey, Dad.

06:19.588 --> 06:22.924
We, uh... we might have stumbled
upon something here.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.664
<i>In the massacre last night,</i>

06:29.665 --> 06:31.399
one of the dead
in the ambush

06:31.400 --> 06:33.367
was a confidential
DEA informant.

06:33.368 --> 06:34.669
He was also
in business

06:34.670 --> 06:35.937
with some of
your detectives.

06:35.938 --> 06:37.305
Do you have proof?

06:37.306 --> 06:40.007
Copies of the wire recordings
are being made as we speak.

06:40.008 --> 06:42.510
We have a voice,
but no name to go with it.

06:43.345 --> 06:44.779
Just one?

06:44.780 --> 06:46.347
Just one on tape.

06:46.348 --> 06:49.550
Clearly, this isn't
just a one-man show.

06:49.551 --> 06:51.452
How much money
we talking about?

06:51.453 --> 06:53.154
Given the chatter
leading up to this,

06:53.155 --> 06:56.491
I'd estimate the haul to be
around $12 million in cash,

06:56.492 --> 06:58.526
another 12 in pure heroin.

06:58.527 --> 07:00.995
That's a hell of a pension.

07:00.996 --> 07:03.030
What's the DEA's stance?

07:03.031 --> 07:05.867
We've got almost two years
staked in the operation.

07:05.868 --> 07:08.736
We'd rather not come out of
the shadows for some rogue cops.

07:08.737 --> 07:10.671
We're pulling all our guys out.

07:10.672 --> 07:12.106
Safety Net's
been cleared

07:12.107 --> 07:13.774
for your department
to move ahead.

07:13.775 --> 07:15.877
I appreciate that, Don.

07:17.412 --> 07:18.846
I'm sorry, Commissioner.

07:18.847 --> 07:21.215
I realize this
is the worst kind of news

07:21.216 --> 07:22.984
someone in your position
can get.

07:24.620 --> 07:26.621
No.

07:26.622 --> 07:29.323
But it's a close second.

07:30.926 --> 07:33.060
<i>If you're wearing</i>
<i>gloves, you want</i>

07:33.061 --> 07:35.363
to get to your gun quick,
so you do this--

07:35.364 --> 07:37.365
you reach the gun,
but if you do anything else

07:37.366 --> 07:38.866
with your arm,
the glove drops wherever.

07:38.867 --> 07:40.368
Yeah, so they came
through the window.

07:40.369 --> 07:42.102
Yeah, I'm figuring there
were at least four

07:42.103 --> 07:43.788
if they had to move
that much weight out.

07:43.789 --> 07:45.506
So two through the door
and two through the window.

07:45.507 --> 07:47.441
Right.
You talking to I.A.?

07:47.442 --> 07:48.676
Uh-uh.

07:48.677 --> 07:49.944
Not even Bello?

07:49.945 --> 07:51.045
Why not?

07:51.046 --> 07:52.480
I trust Alex, but he won't know

07:52.481 --> 07:54.515
if the Templar has eyes
and ears over there.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.751
Jamie was there
on a related incident.

07:56.752 --> 07:58.519
I don't want to set off alarms.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.555
But you can't handle this
on your own, Dad.

08:00.556 --> 08:02.823
I'm not going to.
I have you.

08:02.824 --> 08:04.125
And I got Danny.

08:04.126 --> 08:05.526
Can we trust Detective Curatola?

08:05.527 --> 08:06.961
She's solid.

08:06.962 --> 08:08.196
What about me?

08:08.197 --> 08:09.697
I know this is going to be hard

08:09.698 --> 08:12.099
for you, Jamie, but they do
have eyes and ears on you,

08:12.100 --> 08:14.202
so for now, you got to go
about your business

08:14.203 --> 08:16.837
like it's
any other day.

08:16.838 --> 08:18.573
So we have five, six,

08:18.574 --> 08:21.242
and how many men and women
in the NYPD?

08:21.243 --> 08:22.877
We're looking for a few
out of...

08:22.878 --> 08:24.946
35,000, maybe?

08:24.947 --> 08:26.981
Is there anyone else
we can trust?

08:26.982 --> 08:29.350
Yeah, and I will bring them in
at the right time,

08:29.351 --> 08:31.719
but right now,
we don't know how high up

08:31.720 --> 08:33.821
or how deeply this infection
has spread,

08:33.822 --> 08:37.758
so for now,
this operation stays in-house.

08:37.759 --> 08:40.061
In this house.

Oh, my God!
You're okay. You're okay.

09:32.693 --> 09:34.727
It's all right. What happened?
Oh, my God.

09:34.728 --> 09:36.362
I got away.

09:36.363 --> 09:37.864
They tried to kidnap me.

09:37.865 --> 09:40.833
Okay. All right.

09:40.834 --> 09:43.086
All right. Central.

09:43.087 --> 09:45.905
I thought we were going
to keep it in the family,

09:45.906 --> 09:47.473
not bring in
any more cops.

09:47.474 --> 09:48.541
He's not a cop.

09:48.542 --> 09:49.675
Cliff's a
former Marine.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.210
He served with Danny
in Fallujah.

09:51.211 --> 09:52.812
Cliff was the, uh,
surveillance ears

09:52.813 --> 09:54.464
tracking Saddam Hussein
in Baghdad.

09:54.465 --> 09:56.682
Believe me, Saddam farted,
Cliff could tell you

09:56.683 --> 09:58.484
what kind of kebab
he had for lunch.

09:58.485 --> 10:01.988
Goat was a deep bass,
poultry more a squeaky treble.

10:01.989 --> 10:03.689
Nice. And that's
qualifications for...

10:03.690 --> 10:05.108
Sit.

10:05.109 --> 10:07.643
Listen to the DEA tape.

10:08.729 --> 10:11.664
MAN You already
told me you wanted in.

10:11.665 --> 10:14.167
What you didn't tell me
is what you're bringing.

10:14.168 --> 10:15.468
What's your ticket to the game?

10:15.469 --> 10:16.402
That's the DEA mole.

10:16.403 --> 10:17.637
Should be Panamanian

10:17.638 --> 10:18.905
or Costa Rican.

10:18.906 --> 10:20.406
MAN 2:
What I bring is--

10:20.407 --> 10:22.308
I can't believe
you're asking me this--

10:22.309 --> 10:24.143
kind of a guarantee
you can't get anywhere.

10:24.144 --> 10:27.446
Call it my friends
and family plan.

10:27.447 --> 10:29.448
That's our bad cop.

10:29.449 --> 10:30.917
Room service.

10:32.970 --> 10:34.620
Reagan.

10:35.722 --> 10:38.391
Well, run the ballistic
evidence through IBIS

10:38.392 --> 10:40.660
and see if the weapons
were ever in our system.

10:40.661 --> 10:43.196
To make a crossover comparison,
I need a sample of his voice.

10:43.197 --> 10:44.564
Where do you want to start?

10:44.565 --> 10:46.499
Sonny Malevsky.
That's a leap.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.734
Come on. We're in the business
of making leaps right now.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.002
Sonny Malevsky is the name

10:50.003 --> 10:51.704
that's been popping up
over and over again.

10:51.705 --> 10:53.372
I can't buy a warrant with that.

10:53.373 --> 10:55.491
I'm not
asking you to buy one.

10:55.492 --> 10:57.743
Are we wired to record calls

10:57.744 --> 10:59.111
from the house?
Sure.

10:59.112 --> 11:01.647
Okay, Grandpa, you got this
charity you work for

11:01.648 --> 11:03.316
for the kids.
What is it?

11:03.317 --> 11:04.584
PSL Yankee Stadium Night?

11:04.585 --> 11:06.252
Okay, great.
How about we have Grandpa

11:06.253 --> 11:07.887
make a call
to Sonny Malevsky

11:07.888 --> 11:09.455
asking him
to make a donation?

11:09.456 --> 11:11.157
Call the son of a bitch.

11:11.158 --> 11:12.592
Right.

11:12.593 --> 11:13.793
It's ringing.

11:14.628 --> 11:16.379
Okay.

11:16.380 --> 11:18.831
WOMAN
Manhattan North.

11:18.832 --> 11:21.067
Detective Malevsky, please.
Henry Reagan calling.

11:21.068 --> 11:23.336
Just a moment, please.

11:23.337 --> 11:24.837
Henry? How are you?

11:24.838 --> 11:27.440
I'm good, thank you,
Detective. And you?

11:27.441 --> 11:28.574
You know, hanging in there.

11:28.575 --> 11:30.509
Good, good, good.
Listen.

11:30.510 --> 11:32.411
I need you to take
a leadership role

11:32.412 --> 11:34.881
with the PSL
Yankee Stadium Night.

11:34.882 --> 11:36.065
You know, where we...

11:36.066 --> 11:38.284
Put me down for two grand.
Oh.

11:38.285 --> 11:40.286
Oh, that's very
generous of you.

11:40.287 --> 11:42.321
Thank you very much,
Detective.

11:42.322 --> 11:44.490
Sure thing.
Thank you.

11:44.491 --> 11:47.059
Well, there's a couple of grand
we'll probably never see.

11:49.296 --> 11:51.163
I'd say it's a match
to the voice on the DEA tape.

11:51.164 --> 11:52.832
You're sure?
I'm sure.

11:52.833 --> 11:54.000
Well?

11:54.001 --> 11:55.134
I heard tickets

11:55.135 --> 11:56.402
and friends and family plan,

11:56.403 --> 11:58.304
and that's going
to buy us zip in court.

11:58.305 --> 12:02.425
We got a dead DEA mole talking
turkey with Sonny Malevsky.

12:02.426 --> 12:04.277
That's got to be enough
to buy us

12:04.278 --> 12:05.444
a surveillance
warrant, at least.

12:05.445 --> 12:07.212
I can't promise that.
I can try.

12:07.213 --> 12:09.815
This particular can of worms
only opens from the inside.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.651
We need the warrant.

12:12.552 --> 12:14.687
Ma'am.

12:15.906 --> 12:17.490
Thank you...
Oh.

12:17.491 --> 12:18.858
...um, Officer...?

12:18.859 --> 12:20.826
Reagan. Jamie.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.561
Thank you.

12:22.562 --> 12:23.896
We're almost finished,

12:23.897 --> 12:25.965
and then you'll talk
to the detectives, okay?

12:25.966 --> 12:29.969
Okay, and, um, you don't have
to talk to me like I was eight.

12:30.837 --> 12:33.239
Uh, I'm not. Um...

12:33.240 --> 12:36.309
"And then you'll talk
to the nice detectives."

12:36.310 --> 12:40.079
Uh... I didn't say "nice."

12:41.882 --> 12:43.416
Is there anyone
that you can think of

12:43.417 --> 12:44.917
that might have motive
to kidnap you?

12:48.155 --> 12:51.691
My father was CEO
of Mainways Mortgage.

12:51.692 --> 12:54.560
When things went south
a couple of years ago,

12:54.561 --> 12:57.029
thousands of people got slammed,

12:57.030 --> 13:00.166
but he walked away with millions
of dollars, scot-free.

13:00.167 --> 13:02.168
Throw a rock in Greater Boston,

13:02.169 --> 13:04.136
and you'll hit someone
with a motive.

13:04.137 --> 13:05.838
That must suck for you.

13:05.839 --> 13:07.873
Which is why I'm in New York

13:07.874 --> 13:12.111
for a job interview
with a museum in Abu Dhabi.

13:12.112 --> 13:14.146
That's far.

13:14.147 --> 13:16.182
It's far enough, I hope.

13:17.084 --> 13:19.051
Sit up straight.

13:19.052 --> 13:22.171
Here come the nice detectives.

13:52.753 --> 13:54.787
Reagan.

13:55.655 --> 13:57.540
Sonny Malevsky.

13:57.541 --> 13:59.425
What are you doing up here?

13:59.426 --> 14:01.460
This your car?

14:01.461 --> 14:02.628
Yeah.

14:02.629 --> 14:04.530
Got the hemi, huh?

14:04.531 --> 14:05.898
Got to get the hemi.

14:05.899 --> 14:07.700
Go big or go home.
That's right.

14:07.701 --> 14:09.168
Try not to drool on it.

14:09.169 --> 14:10.469
Hard not to.

14:10.470 --> 14:12.304
So what are you doing up here?

14:12.305 --> 14:13.973
Figured you for nosebleeds

14:13.974 --> 14:15.541
north of Times Square.

14:15.542 --> 14:18.811
Yeah. Just came to, uh, close
a few cases up with Sizowitz.

14:20.614 --> 14:21.947
So, you love the car, huh?

14:21.948 --> 14:24.617
I do. You're thinking
about getting one?

14:24.618 --> 14:26.419
Uh, you know,
wife and two kids--

14:26.420 --> 14:28.821
every check is spoken for.

14:28.822 --> 14:30.740
Reagan?

14:30.741 --> 14:32.358
Sizowitz is off today.

14:32.359 --> 14:38.130
Yeah. He, um, said he'd leave
the files on the desk.

14:39.099 --> 14:41.467
Drive safe.

14:50.811 --> 14:52.912
Reagan?

14:52.913 --> 14:56.198
Interested in some overtime today?
If you need me, Captain, sure.

14:56.199 --> 14:58.134
You'll be stationed outside
Ms. Peck's hotel room.

14:58.135 --> 14:59.735
Seriously?

14:59.736 --> 15:02.121
The incident occurred within the
confines of our precinct, and

15:02.122 --> 15:03.489
until we have
a better assessment

15:03.490 --> 15:05.091
of the ongoing threat,
I offered her

15:05.092 --> 15:06.358
police escort
as a courtesy.

15:06.359 --> 15:08.160
You can stay in your
street clothes.

15:08.161 --> 15:10.096
We're not trying
to broadcast the situation.

15:10.097 --> 15:11.864
10-4.

15:27.013 --> 15:29.181
Um...

15:31.184 --> 15:32.268
You want something?

15:32.269 --> 15:34.437
Oh, just a chair
for out in the hall.

15:34.438 --> 15:36.889
I've kind of been
on my feet all day, so...

15:36.890 --> 15:38.324
This one okay?

15:38.325 --> 15:39.592
Of course.

15:39.593 --> 15:40.860
All right.

15:42.496 --> 15:46.198
Um... I don't really feel
like talking to anybody.

15:50.203 --> 15:52.138
If you do have a visitor, though,
you'll give me a heads-up?

15:52.139 --> 15:53.305
Of course.
Okay.

15:53.306 --> 15:56.442
Um, which of their teams
are you a fan of?

15:56.443 --> 15:57.743
Their teams?

15:57.744 --> 15:58.944
Of Harvard's.

15:58.945 --> 16:00.796
Oh, uh,

16:00.797 --> 16:02.715
I don't really follow
college sports.

16:02.716 --> 16:04.416
This is from when I went there.

16:04.417 --> 16:07.253
You went to Harvard?
The law school.

16:07.254 --> 16:08.954
Really?

16:08.955 --> 16:11.490
Going to be a great day
when me saying "Harvard"

16:11.491 --> 16:14.360
isn't followed by someone
else saying, "Really?"

16:14.361 --> 16:16.862
No, I didn't mean that...

16:16.863 --> 16:19.198
It's just a surprise.

16:19.199 --> 16:21.466
I know. Um, I'll
be right outside.

16:27.207 --> 16:28.574
Who is it?

16:28.575 --> 16:30.609
It's Billy.
It's...

16:30.610 --> 16:32.111
It's okay.

16:32.112 --> 16:33.913
Hi.
Oh, hi.

16:33.914 --> 16:37.316
I came from work the
second I heard. Oh.

16:37.317 --> 16:38.650
Oh, you poor thing.

16:38.651 --> 16:40.035
I'm okay now.

16:40.036 --> 16:42.154
Oh, now that I'm here.

16:43.890 --> 16:45.357
I'll just be outside.

16:45.358 --> 16:47.626
Oh, um, Billy Coffin,

16:47.627 --> 16:49.895
Police Officer Reagan.

16:49.896 --> 16:51.931
Hi.

16:51.932 --> 16:53.516
They gave you a bodyguard?

16:53.517 --> 16:55.935
Just a presence
at Ms. Peck's option.

16:55.936 --> 16:57.636
Well, thanks for being here.

16:57.637 --> 16:59.772
I'll be outside.

17:10.617 --> 17:12.351
Hey, Dad, it's me.

17:12.352 --> 17:13.652
What have we got?

17:13.653 --> 17:14.853
We're making progress.

17:14.854 --> 17:16.922
We got eyes and ears
on Malevsky.

17:16.923 --> 17:18.223
Thanks for checking in.

17:18.224 --> 17:20.192
All I'm saying is,
if they go 30 seconds

17:20.193 --> 17:21.527
bitching about their wives
or whatever,

17:21.528 --> 17:22.895
you need
to minimize the wire.

17:22.896 --> 17:24.063
Minimize the wire?

17:24.064 --> 17:25.330
Cut the feed.

17:25.332 --> 17:27.132
Just drop in 30 seconds later.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.268
Hopefully, they've changed the
subject to something we can use

17:29.269 --> 17:30.886
in court.
That's crazy.

17:30.887 --> 17:32.421
That's the law.

17:32.422 --> 17:34.173
You can't just listen till
you get what you're looking for.

17:34.174 --> 17:35.908
You can't just pan
for gold, Cliff.

17:35.909 --> 17:39.478
I miss Marine Intelligence,
though you're a lot prettier.

17:40.546 --> 17:42.565
Incoming from Malevsky's cell.

17:42.566 --> 17:43.816
Yeah. Malevsky.

17:43.817 --> 17:45.784
Sonny, Damon.

17:45.785 --> 17:46.819
What's up?

17:46.820 --> 17:48.153
We got a problem.
There was a guy

17:48.154 --> 17:49.221
at the thing we
didn't know about.

17:49.222 --> 17:50.422
What kind of guy?

17:50.423 --> 17:51.957
A spook. What agency,

17:51.958 --> 17:53.225
bureau, we don't know.

17:53.226 --> 17:54.593
Who's sniffing?

17:54.594 --> 17:56.962
- Nobody yet, that we know of.
- What do we know?

17:56.963 --> 18:00.916
That a guy got Reagan'ed,
and we didn't even know it.

18:00.917 --> 18:02.835
All right.
Tell everyone to get ready.

18:02.836 --> 18:05.570
We're moving
the party up.

18:08.642 --> 18:10.776
They gave it Joe's name.

18:15.448 --> 18:19.518
"Damon Camia, Rego Park"?

18:19.519 --> 18:23.155
Camia. Camia and Malevsky worked
in Warrants with Joe.

18:23.156 --> 18:25.024
Yeah.

18:25.025 --> 18:26.358
So, what have we got?

18:26.359 --> 18:28.894
No physical evidence,

18:28.895 --> 18:30.696
no eyewitnesses.

18:30.697 --> 18:32.898
Not enough
for what we want them for.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.302
Go ahead, Baker.

18:36.303 --> 18:40.105
Who was the supervisor
that signed off on it that day?

18:45.712 --> 18:47.746
Thank you, Baker.

18:50.116 --> 18:54.219
Let's cover these guys
from every possible angle.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.504
Let's get eyes on their
homes, text messages,

18:55.505 --> 18:56.822
e-mails, GPS on their cars
and ears on their phones.

18:56.823 --> 18:58.691
I'm on it.

18:58.692 --> 19:01.560
Erin, get the necessary
warrants on Camia.

19:01.561 --> 19:04.463
I'm gonna go see an old friend.

19:25.485 --> 19:27.036
Frank!

19:27.037 --> 19:29.038
I mean, Commissioner.

19:29.039 --> 19:31.824
Hello, Alice.
Could Gerry come out?

19:31.825 --> 19:34.043
Oh, yeah. Gerry?

19:34.044 --> 19:37.162
Gerry, you are never gonna guess
who's out here.

19:37.163 --> 19:38.663
Oh, I'm sorry.
My manners.

19:38.664 --> 19:40.049
Please come on in.

19:40.050 --> 19:42.351
No, that's okay.
This'll just take a minute.

19:42.352 --> 19:44.103
Police business.
Commissioner.

19:44.104 --> 19:46.805
Alice, don't leave the
man standing there.

19:46.806 --> 19:50.075
She didn't, Gerry.
Walk with me.

19:52.062 --> 19:54.279
So, uh, how's
your family?

19:54.280 --> 19:57.282
They're all good.
Thanks for asking. Yours?

19:57.283 --> 19:59.385
Uh, Sean's coaching
lacrosse at Stony Brook.

19:59.386 --> 20:01.870
Tina's got a third
baby girl on the way.

20:01.871 --> 20:03.589
That's good to hear.

20:03.590 --> 20:05.624
So, isn't your, uh,
Jamie a rookie...?

20:05.625 --> 20:07.159
On January 9, you signed off

20:07.160 --> 20:09.228
on a cache
of confiscated weapons

20:09.229 --> 20:11.130
as being destroyed,

20:11.131 --> 20:12.748
but a number of Glock nines

20:12.749 --> 20:15.567
never made the trip
to the furnace.

20:15.568 --> 20:17.503
Who'd you give them to?

20:19.038 --> 20:21.256
Oh.

20:24.544 --> 20:26.729
Ah, geez.

20:27.714 --> 20:30.099
You got ten seconds, or no deal.

20:31.684 --> 20:33.652
What deal?

20:33.653 --> 20:35.554
The only deal
that's out there for you.

20:35.555 --> 20:37.089
Nine, eight...
All right.

20:37.090 --> 20:38.257
...seven, six...

20:38.258 --> 20:39.658
All right, all right.

20:39.659 --> 20:42.227
Art Buchanan and Will Atwater,

20:42.228 --> 20:44.279
Narcotics, Manhattan North.

20:44.280 --> 20:45.364
That's it?

20:45.365 --> 20:47.733
Those are the two I dealt with.

20:47.734 --> 20:49.501
There's another name.

20:49.502 --> 20:50.953
Whoever reached out to you

20:50.954 --> 20:52.805
and brought you in
in the first place.

20:52.806 --> 20:54.940
I'll find the match.
You know I will.

20:54.941 --> 20:57.810
Three, two, one.

20:57.811 --> 21:00.262
Teddy Chapin, the 31 Precinct.

21:14.561 --> 21:16.595
What deal?

21:16.596 --> 21:18.197
I want your shield and guns

21:18.198 --> 21:20.365
on your chief's desk
first thing tomorrow,

21:20.366 --> 21:22.067
and your only pension's

21:22.068 --> 21:25.070
whatever you made
working your little side deal.

21:25.071 --> 21:27.406
I don't want to see you
near a precinct,

21:27.407 --> 21:28.874
or at a retirement party,

21:28.875 --> 21:31.376
or even wearing
an NYPD baseball cap.

21:31.377 --> 21:33.579
And not a word to anybody.

21:33.580 --> 21:37.049
Thank you.

21:38.985 --> 21:41.086
And that's that.

21:53.539 --> 21:55.107
Got a second?

21:55.166 --> 21:57.300
Yeah, what's up,
partner?

21:58.669 --> 22:02.038
I need you to slap a tracker
on a guy, stake him out.

22:02.039 --> 22:04.307
The warrant's
on the way.

22:04.308 --> 22:06.076
We pick up a case
I don't know about?

22:06.077 --> 22:07.544
Not from Gormley.

22:08.379 --> 22:10.480
Okay.

22:10.481 --> 22:12.449
I'm gonna ask you to
do something, Jack,

22:12.450 --> 22:15.352
I know you're not going
to want to do it.

22:15.353 --> 22:17.387
The guy's on the job.

22:17.388 --> 22:21.925
It's Damon Camia-- he's a
detective with the 27 squad.

22:24.195 --> 22:25.141
I'm not a rat, Danny,

22:25.142 --> 22:26.342
- I know.
- I don't want to be.

22:27.765 --> 22:29.733
I know.

22:29.734 --> 22:32.035
I'm not a rat either,
Jack, but I need this.

22:32.036 --> 22:36.439
You know I would walk
on nails for you...

22:36.440 --> 22:40.043
but you are asking me to go
against everything that I am.

22:40.044 --> 22:41.678
They killed my brother, Jackie.

22:43.147 --> 22:45.882
Camia and the Blue Templar--
they killed Joe.

23:10.041 --> 23:12.008
Hey.

23:12.009 --> 23:13.610
Yeah, Camia left
in his personal car

23:13.611 --> 23:15.679
an hour before end of tour.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.113
DANNY
Wherever he goes, you go.

23:17.114 --> 23:18.381
Yeah, I'll stay with.

23:22.854 --> 23:25.488
Ms. Peck, your food is here.

23:28.609 --> 23:30.527
I ordered plenty
for both of us.

23:30.528 --> 23:31.628
Come on in.

23:31.629 --> 23:35.131
Um... I, uh...

23:35.132 --> 23:36.633
Please.

23:36.634 --> 23:38.301
I'd appreciate the company.

23:38.302 --> 23:41.104
If I eat alone tonight,
I won't eat, and I'm starving.

23:41.105 --> 23:43.440
All right.

23:43.441 --> 23:45.175
Cliff, what do
you got for me?

23:45.176 --> 23:46.442
Nothing--

23:46.443 --> 23:48.161
no calls going out, incoming
straight to voice mail,

23:48.162 --> 23:49.980
and hang-ups.

23:49.981 --> 23:52.682
I'm afraid they all
took up vows of silence.

23:52.683 --> 23:53.817
When was the last outgoing call

23:53.818 --> 23:55.001
from any of
these guys?

23:55.002 --> 23:56.303
Let me take a look.

24:10.368 --> 24:13.036
How could I not see it?

24:13.037 --> 24:15.505
There's nothing
down that road, Dad.

24:17.441 --> 24:19.042
It's a dead end.

24:34.875 --> 24:36.376
Well, it wasn't
a lightning bolt exactly,

24:36.377 --> 24:38.595
but I was sitting around
with a bunch

24:38.596 --> 24:40.363
of other 1-L classmates
at dinner one night

24:40.364 --> 24:41.998
and everyone was talking
about what firms offer

24:41.999 --> 24:45.685
what starting salaries
and what bonus so and so got

24:45.686 --> 24:48.305
their second year
at Dewey, Screwem and Howe.

24:48.306 --> 24:51.474
But that's any grad
school-- law, med.

24:51.475 --> 24:54.477
Right, but what struck me is--

24:54.478 --> 24:56.947
and this is going to sound
naive or idealistic

24:56.948 --> 24:59.249
or whatever, but I don't care
because it's true--

24:59.250 --> 25:02.085
in all those years
of family dinners,

25:02.086 --> 25:04.621
I never once heard them talk
about the job

25:04.622 --> 25:06.056
in terms of what they made.

25:06.057 --> 25:07.757
I mean, what they made
just wasn't the reason

25:07.758 --> 25:08.925
they did
what they did.

25:08.926 --> 25:10.126
What was?

25:10.127 --> 25:12.028
The work itself.

25:12.029 --> 25:14.664
Um, you know, the stories
that you lived to tell.

25:14.665 --> 25:16.466
I mean,
you could sit my dad

25:16.467 --> 25:19.703
or my brother down
next to a king, a rock star,

25:19.704 --> 25:21.271
a billionaire, I-I don't care,

25:21.272 --> 25:23.606
that person is going to ask
for just one more story

25:23.607 --> 25:24.741
all night long.

25:24.742 --> 25:26.076
So you became a cop

25:26.077 --> 25:28.578
to be the most sought-after
guest at dinner parties.

25:28.579 --> 25:29.512
Yes.

25:29.513 --> 25:31.414
Yeah.

25:32.416 --> 25:35.752
Um, I became a cop
to make a difference

25:35.753 --> 25:38.822
in-in a good way,
a real way,

25:38.823 --> 25:41.024
and if I get to live some
great stories along the way,

25:41.025 --> 25:43.293
that's just icing on the cake.

25:45.279 --> 25:48.248
Excuse me.

25:48.249 --> 25:50.600
Uh, Billy, I'll call you
back in a bit, okay?

25:50.601 --> 25:51.801
Love you.

25:51.802 --> 25:54.371
Bye.

25:54.372 --> 25:57.574
Uh, listen,
thank you for dinner.

25:57.575 --> 25:59.642
Oh.

25:59.643 --> 26:03.246
Wow, um, I'm flattered.

26:03.247 --> 26:04.547
Billy's gay,

26:04.548 --> 26:06.016
you know.

26:06.017 --> 26:08.184
He locks himself in the closet
because of his family,

26:08.185 --> 26:11.154
but he's been all about the boys
since we were ten.

26:12.123 --> 26:16.393
Um, no, I didn't,
but, um, um, no matter.

26:16.394 --> 26:18.061
My relief will probably be here
any minute,

26:18.062 --> 26:21.731
so I should get back outside.

26:23.567 --> 26:25.768
Jamie.

26:28.372 --> 26:30.640
Um...

26:32.143 --> 26:33.676
Uh, will you be
back tomorrow?

26:33.677 --> 26:36.212
Um, if that's my
assignment, yeah.

26:36.213 --> 26:38.114
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

26:58.986 --> 27:01.354
Reagan, it's Petrillo,
I'm your relief.

27:01.355 --> 27:04.157
Uh, right-right there.

27:04.158 --> 27:07.343
Um, good night.
Good night.

27:54.973 --> 27:56.073
DANNY Jackie.
Yeah.

27:56.113 --> 27:57.814
- Where the hell have you been?
- I was busy, okay?!

27:57.815 --> 27:59.015
Just listen up.

27:59.016 --> 28:00.350
Okay, hold on, hold on.

28:00.351 --> 28:02.452
Let me put you
on speakerphone.

28:02.453 --> 28:04.454
All right, go ahead.

28:04.455 --> 28:06.356
Listen, a car, a car,
not Camia's car--

28:06.357 --> 28:10.760
another, another SUV, a black
SUV with New York plates--

28:10.761 --> 28:12.295
he, uh, followed me
from the airport,

28:12.296 --> 28:14.965
and I... I thought I lost him,
but he came up behind me

28:14.966 --> 28:17.267
and he just pushed me
off the side of the road.

28:17.268 --> 28:19.569
I think I'm okay--
just a few bruises

28:19.570 --> 28:21.538
from-from the airbag.

28:21.539 --> 28:23.406
But, listen,
he dropped off his wife

28:23.407 --> 28:25.242
and his kids at JFK

28:25.243 --> 28:28.111
with enough luggage
to go on a Bon Jovi tour.

28:28.112 --> 28:29.579
It was Jet Blue international,

28:29.580 --> 28:31.731
I don't know
where it was headed to,

28:31.732 --> 28:34.017
but I got close enough
to hear the good-byes,

28:34.018 --> 28:36.253
and he said he'd be seeing them
in a few days.

28:36.254 --> 28:37.420
Okay, where's Camia now?

28:37.421 --> 28:38.421
Wait.

28:38.422 --> 28:43.043
Um... uh, yeah...

28:43.044 --> 28:45.579
it looks like Camia's back
at his house, but listen to me--

28:45.580 --> 28:48.231
these guys are definitely
getting the hell out of Dodge.

28:48.232 --> 28:49.466
All right, good work.

28:49.467 --> 28:50.600
Keep your phone on.

28:50.601 --> 28:52.402
Yeah.

28:52.403 --> 28:54.271
We can't take chances
waiting any longer.

28:54.272 --> 28:55.772
They're cornered
and they know it.

28:55.773 --> 28:57.140
Erin,

28:57.141 --> 28:59.142
I can bring
in Buchanan and Atwater

28:59.143 --> 29:02.712
for receiving the weapons
out of Property, but Camia...

29:02.713 --> 29:05.815
If we assume the wife is
traveling with a pile of cash,

29:05.816 --> 29:08.251
we can run the manifests
for Jet Blue,

29:08.252 --> 29:10.620
alert Customs on the end,
and sweat the wife,

29:10.621 --> 29:11.788
but that's an "if."

29:11.789 --> 29:13.957
Where do I start?

29:13.958 --> 29:15.525
Malevsky first.

29:15.526 --> 29:17.127
Great.

29:18.229 --> 29:20.230
Cliff, feed me his location.

29:20.231 --> 29:21.364
Got your back.

29:33.344 --> 29:34.945
This is Officer Reagan.

29:34.946 --> 29:38.181
Are Detectives Trotta or Stanton
still there?

29:38.182 --> 29:39.382
I-I'm sorry, Detective,

29:39.383 --> 29:40.850
I-I'm just trying
to get this straight.

29:40.851 --> 29:42.218
DCPI hasn't released
any information

29:42.219 --> 29:44.321
regarding the kidnap attempt?

29:44.322 --> 29:45.455
The father's traveling
in Europe,

29:45.456 --> 29:46.856
we haven't been able
to reach him.

29:46.857 --> 29:48.959
We wanted to see
if he had any insights

29:48.960 --> 29:50.493
before we went wide with this

29:50.494 --> 29:53.730
and scared the crap out
of every female tourist in town.

29:53.731 --> 29:55.532
You playing detective, rookie?

29:55.533 --> 29:57.801
No, no, sir,
thanks for your time.

30:03.140 --> 30:05.175
Laura Peck, room 1103.

30:42.997 --> 30:45.882
Father, Detective
Reagan with the NYPD.

30:45.883 --> 30:47.617
Sonny Malevsky--
is that his car?

30:47.618 --> 30:49.686
Oh, my,
is it stolen?

30:49.687 --> 30:52.322
No, no, Malevsky...
He donated it for the raffle.

30:52.323 --> 30:53.256
Is he here now?

30:53.257 --> 30:54.424
He was just here.

30:54.425 --> 30:55.892
He just dropped it off

30:55.893 --> 30:57.293
about ten minutes ago.

30:57.294 --> 30:58.461
Okay, I'm sorry to trouble you.

30:58.462 --> 30:59.829
Thank you.

31:00.765 --> 31:02.298
Dad, yeah.

31:02.299 --> 31:03.967
No, Malevsky dumped
the car, Dad.

31:03.968 --> 31:05.802
No, he's off the grid.

31:05.803 --> 31:07.003
Buchanan?

31:07.004 --> 31:08.171
Okay, I'm after him.

31:08.172 --> 31:11.074
All right, yeah, I'm on it.

31:16.180 --> 31:17.781
Billy, someone tried
to kidnap me this morning.

31:17.782 --> 31:19.115
Would you feel safe?

31:19.116 --> 31:20.383
You need to get out.

31:24.488 --> 31:25.705
Laura!

31:25.706 --> 31:27.523
You're with me.
Laura!

31:27.524 --> 31:29.292
Have a few laughs.

31:33.097 --> 31:34.214
No, no!

31:35.249 --> 31:37.717
No, no!

31:37.718 --> 31:39.069
No!

31:39.970 --> 31:42.072
No, no!

31:42.073 --> 31:44.140
Hey, police!

31:46.444 --> 31:47.210
Hey!

31:52.983 --> 31:54.818
On your stomach!
On your stomach!

31:54.819 --> 31:56.052
Hands behind your back.

31:56.053 --> 31:57.253
Are you okay?

31:57.254 --> 31:59.689
I'm okay. I'm okay.

31:59.690 --> 32:01.691
Come on, come one,
let's get inside.

32:01.692 --> 32:03.726
Don't move, you stay right where
I can see you, Coffin.

32:03.727 --> 32:04.961
What?

32:04.962 --> 32:06.096
You heard me--
you stay

32:06.097 --> 32:07.197
right there.

32:07.198 --> 32:08.932
Call 911!

32:11.769 --> 32:14.337
I'm still sitting
across from Buchanan's, Dad.

32:14.338 --> 32:16.806
No sign of him,
no lights on, nothing.

32:16.807 --> 32:19.175
No, Jackie says
there's no sign of him either.

32:19.176 --> 32:20.910
She thinks he's not home.

32:20.911 --> 32:22.145
This doesn't look good, Dad.

32:22.146 --> 32:23.713
I'm thinking we should maybe
put it over the air.

32:23.714 --> 32:25.281
Hold on, hold on.

32:25.282 --> 32:26.433
Okay, he was home after all.

32:26.434 --> 32:28.184
He must have been watching
the street.

32:28.185 --> 32:29.752
And he's on the move.

32:31.122 --> 32:33.656
Okay, Dad, I'm gonna see
where the party's at.

32:45.884 --> 32:48.652
Boston PD had both the driver
and your wounded

32:48.661 --> 32:51.630
in their system, a couple
of enforcers for a Southie crew

32:51.631 --> 32:55.067
with a lot of kidnapping
and extortion on their resumes.

32:55.068 --> 32:56.201
Coffin's waiting for his lawyer,

32:56.202 --> 32:58.704
but why don't you put it
all together for me?

32:58.705 --> 33:00.372
Uh, I can't do that.

33:00.373 --> 33:01.874
No theory, Officer?

33:02.709 --> 33:04.643
First thing Coffin said was,

33:04.644 --> 33:08.013
"I left work
as soon as I heard."

33:08.014 --> 33:10.582
I guess it just didn't sit right
with me in the back of my mind,

33:10.583 --> 33:13.285
and then when I checked
with you, the nickel dropped.

33:13.286 --> 33:15.087
Ms. Peck hadn't
called anyone yet.

33:15.922 --> 33:17.623
Coffin could have only
heard about it

33:17.624 --> 33:19.792
through the guys
that tried to snatch her, so...

33:19.793 --> 33:21.059
And when you you checked with me

33:21.060 --> 33:22.494
is when you should have
said something.

33:24.330 --> 33:26.265
I'm just glad
I made it back here in time.

33:26.266 --> 33:28.033
First time
you shot someone, kid?

33:28.034 --> 33:30.436
Yes, sir.

33:30.437 --> 33:32.638
Enjoy the paperwork.

33:42.182 --> 33:44.166
Hey, Dad.

33:44.167 --> 33:46.752
You okay?

33:49.956 --> 33:51.990
Ms. Peck,
I got to get going.

33:51.991 --> 33:54.993
Please, can't you just
stay for a little while?

33:54.994 --> 33:57.729
Uh, I really can't.
My family needs me.

33:57.730 --> 34:00.365
Okay. Uh, then...

34:00.366 --> 34:02.367
thank you.

34:02.368 --> 34:04.136
Yeah.

34:10.810 --> 34:13.812
If you need anything, you know
I work out of the 12th.

34:13.813 --> 34:14.980
Look me up.

34:14.981 --> 34:17.349
Okay.

34:17.350 --> 34:19.150
And if Abu Dhabi
doesn't work out,

34:19.150 --> 34:21.652
we have a lot
of nice museums right here.

34:29.963 --> 34:32.848
Okay, Dad.

34:32.849 --> 34:34.650
Buchanan just picked up Malevsky

34:34.650 --> 34:36.235
at a diner off of the BQE.

34:36.235 --> 34:37.735
They're back on it
and heading north.

34:37.737 --> 34:39.905
Atwater and Camia both
just got off the BQE

34:39.906 --> 34:41.406
just north
of the Pulaski Bridge.

34:41.407 --> 34:42.875
They're on side streets
in Greenpoint.

34:42.876 --> 34:44.176
They're gonna meet.

34:44.177 --> 34:45.476
I'll stay with Malevsky
and call in the location.

34:45.478 --> 34:47.228
Dad, if this is
what I think it is,

34:47.230 --> 34:49.447
we're going to need some backup,
and it's gonna have to be guys

34:49.449 --> 34:50.748
that are gonna actually
back us up.
