WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.037
She's coming in hot.
She's The Mick.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.173
-Yaah!
-I just built that.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.407
It didn't take.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
And check out our other Fox
programs-- Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
The Last Man on Earth and
Ghosted.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.548
I don't really know how
to do any of this stuff.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.321
(laughter)

00:20.354 --> 00:21.755
-Oh...
-MICKEY: All right.

00:21.789 --> 00:24.425
Like the energy in here.
Catch me up to speed.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.260
Oh. Uh, Benny found
Chip's dad's rap sheet,

00:26.294 --> 00:28.329
and we're just making fun of
his face and his life and stuff.

00:28.362 --> 00:31.065
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.600
-Do it, do it.
-Okay, I got one.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.202
(deep voice):
Uh, hello, my name is Bert.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.104
Uh, despite
my four drunk driving arrests,

00:36.137 --> 00:39.673
I totally intend
to get my life back on track.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.276
(laughs)

00:42.310 --> 00:43.711
What? Are you serious?

00:43.744 --> 00:46.580
There's no way this guy
could get his life ba...

00:47.915 --> 00:49.517
Hey. What's up?

00:49.550 --> 00:51.085
It's private stuff.
Give it-- give it back.

00:51.119 --> 00:52.953
Well, it's actually not.

00:52.986 --> 00:55.789
It's-it's sort of public record.

00:55.823 --> 00:58.126
-Sorry, Chip. We just wanted
to know more about... -What?

00:58.159 --> 01:01.262
That I'm the bastard of some
craphead strip club owner?

01:01.295 --> 01:02.696
Okay, well, now you know. The...

01:02.730 --> 01:04.132
the cat's out of the bag.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.567
(doorbell rings)

01:06.600 --> 01:08.502
(quietly):
Excuse me.

01:12.973 --> 01:13.974
CHIP:
What...?

01:15.976 --> 01:17.311
Mackenzie Molng?

01:20.080 --> 01:21.982
(grunts)
Oh...

01:24.918 --> 01:25.886
You okay?

01:25.919 --> 01:27.755
Yeah, I'm good. How are you?

01:27.788 --> 01:29.290
I have information
regarding James Shepherd.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.825
What, did he shoplift
a hot dog or something?

01:31.859 --> 01:32.960
(laughter)

01:32.993 --> 01:33.827
He's dead.

01:35.996 --> 01:38.432
(laughs)

01:40.033 --> 01:42.670
Found him in the East River.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.839
This is, uh, all he had on him.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.746
(exhales)

01:52.780 --> 01:54.114
Ready?

01:54.148 --> 01:56.384
Yeah.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.756
(sighs)

02:02.790 --> 02:06.627
Yup. That is him, all right.

02:06.660 --> 02:10.264
What? That is not Jimmy, that's
just some fat mustached man.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.865
What?
Jimmy was a fat mustached man.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.467
Yes, I understand that,
but not nearly

02:13.501 --> 02:15.436
as fat and mustached
as this man.

02:15.469 --> 02:19.507
Oh, Mickey, you-you know, denial
is the first stage of grief.

02:19.540 --> 02:22.009
Sir, can you flip him over,
please?

02:22.042 --> 02:23.110
We need to see his ass.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.144
Jimmy had a burned ass.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.279
Can you flip him over, please?

02:25.313 --> 02:26.180
I can't do that.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.783
Right. Right,
of course you can't.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.385
Been here before.

02:31.419 --> 02:33.887
Um, can you do it now?

02:33.921 --> 02:36.190
No, I mean physically.
He's 200 pounds.

02:36.224 --> 02:37.625
(laughs)
Soaking wet.

02:37.658 --> 02:38.892
-Alba.
-Hmm?

02:38.926 --> 02:40.694
-Have some respect for the dead.
-I...

02:40.728 --> 02:43.231
Now go grab one of his legs
so I can look inside his ass.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.399
-You, too, sir. Come on.
-ALBA: Oh, Mickey, no.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.870
Ew.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.074
Great news. Jimmy's alive.
Actually,

02:54.107 --> 02:56.677
don't really know that for sure,
but that's not his body.

02:56.710 --> 02:57.878
So what happens to him now?

02:57.911 --> 02:59.413
Uh... I don't know, pal.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.482
But it can't be good
if his wallet's washing up

03:01.515 --> 03:03.351
in the pocket
of some bloated hobo.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.052
Not Jimmy, the body.

03:05.085 --> 03:07.588
Oh. I don't know. I guess
they bury it or burn it, or...

03:07.621 --> 03:09.223
Come on, let's roll.

03:09.257 --> 03:11.525
Hold on. We waste half a day
getting to the city,

03:11.559 --> 03:13.060
and Jimmy's not even dead?

03:13.093 --> 03:14.695
We should stop by the penthouse.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.664
-You told me you sold that?
-I did tell you that.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.733
So why were we living
in some burned down death trap?

03:19.767 --> 03:21.335
Oh, because my room was fine.

03:21.369 --> 03:23.170
And on the weekends,
I would sleep in the penthouse.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.539
-You're sick.
-ALBA: Wait, hey, hey, hey.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.841
How about we go see Hamilton
while we're here?

03:27.875 --> 03:29.410
Y-You can't get tickets,
it's impossible.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.445
-I've seen it twice.
-It's so frickin' moving.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.281
-What? -All right,
tickets are impossible to get

03:33.314 --> 03:35.549
unless you're
a-a spoiled jackass.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.719
Okay, I'm gonna go. Do a little
shopping, get some lunch. Ooh.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.053
We should go
to Mom's old strip club

03:40.087 --> 03:41.389
and try to get eyes on your dad.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.923
No way, I am not going there.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.125
Ay, Chip, you at least
need to see the guy.

03:45.158 --> 03:47.428
The last time you said that,
I got my frickin' heart stomped.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.597
-Wha...
-All right, listen. Chip.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.599
I know it's not easy,
but the guy's your dad.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.701
So I think it's pretty important
that you go see him.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.570
-How bad could he be?
-Oh, I-I bet he's horrific.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.872
But you need to see what
you're gonna turn into one day.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.641
You know?

04:00.674 --> 04:02.776
All right, gang.
Let's go to that penthouse, huh?

04:02.810 --> 04:05.313
No. We can't just
leave him here.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.114
Are you talking about
that dead body again?

04:07.147 --> 04:08.982
Yes. He's a person.
He deserves better.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.285
I won't leave without him.

04:14.622 --> 04:15.756
* You know I smashed her

04:15.789 --> 04:17.391
* You know
I smashed her *

04:17.425 --> 04:18.626
* You know I smashed her...

04:18.659 --> 04:21.128
BERT:
No, shut up. Shut up!

04:21.161 --> 04:23.631
You're late again,
and it's back to Pittsburgh.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.833
Now, get out there and shake
whatever that cake tray is

04:25.866 --> 04:28.168
you call an ass! Go!

04:28.201 --> 04:29.937
* Yeah, bro, I passed her...

04:29.970 --> 04:31.238
What the...?

04:31.271 --> 04:34.141
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
come on.

04:34.174 --> 04:35.509
No. No, no, no.
What? What are we...

04:35.543 --> 04:36.777
what are we,
letting kids in now?

04:36.810 --> 04:38.612
How'd you get past the bouncer?

04:38.646 --> 04:39.980
There was no bouncer.

04:40.013 --> 04:40.981
No bouncer?

04:41.014 --> 04:42.182
You didn't see Ronnie out there?

04:42.215 --> 04:45.152
-No.
-Hey! Where the hell is Ronnie?

04:45.185 --> 04:46.787
Why do I pay anybody?

04:46.820 --> 04:48.622
I-I-I have no idea.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.090
What do you know?
Like, who are you?

04:50.123 --> 04:51.291
Let's start there.

04:51.325 --> 04:54.628
I am your son.

04:56.196 --> 04:59.533
(chuckles)
Yeah, yeah. Nice try.

04:59.567 --> 05:02.135
Nice try, 'cause I've never seen
this broad before in my life.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.871
I'm not his mom, I'm his sister.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.138
You're his sister?

05:05.172 --> 05:06.474
You're not his mom?

05:06.507 --> 05:08.008
Hey, how you doing?

05:08.041 --> 05:09.377
-My name is Bert.
-Listen, we think our mom

05:09.410 --> 05:10.878
used to work here.
Poodle Pemberton.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.647
Poodle Pember...
Nah, I don't know that name.

05:13.681 --> 05:14.948
You're probably
at the wrong place,

05:14.982 --> 05:17.150
so... come on, guys, get out.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.787
-Go. Get out. -Now what about,
uh, Pamela Molng?

05:19.820 --> 05:21.889
Oh, Pamela Molng. Yeah, yeah.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.123
Great ass.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.492
Terrible dancer.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.159
Yeah, Pamela Molng, okay.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.396
All right. Yeah.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.230
What do you want?

05:30.263 --> 05:33.401
Nothing really, I guess
I just wanted to meet you.

05:35.403 --> 05:36.837
Oh, geez.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.239
Um...

05:39.272 --> 05:42.175
I feel bad, like a jerk.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.878
You know? Let me make it up
to you. Let me-- let me get you

05:44.912 --> 05:46.480
something to drink.
You-you... can you drink?

05:46.514 --> 05:48.248
Do you drink? Can you?
I... there's so much

05:48.281 --> 05:49.750
I don't know about you.

05:49.783 --> 05:50.918
Hey, let's start with a tour.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.185
You want to come with us?

05:52.219 --> 05:53.353
-You guys go ahead.
-Just the boys.

05:53.387 --> 05:54.755
That's better, then. Okay?

05:54.788 --> 05:56.924
What do you say?
Come on, buddy.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.394
Where do you want
to be scattered, mister?

06:00.428 --> 06:03.764
Yankee Stadium, off the top
of the Empire State Building?

06:03.797 --> 06:06.199
Wherever we go,
it's gonna be special.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.368
It'd better be. I had to kick
that creepy guy 60 bucks

06:08.402 --> 06:09.870
to get those ashes.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.505
(sighs)
Yeah.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.541
I'm still not convinced
that isn't Jimmy.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.175
Ah, Jimmy's fine.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.077
Ashes probably took his wallet,
beat him up a bit,

06:17.110 --> 06:18.546
and then sent him on his way.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.780
And that makes you happy?

06:19.813 --> 06:21.181
I'm not happy 'cause of that.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.750
Happy 'cause I won the breakup.

06:22.783 --> 06:23.917
Congratulations.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.052
Yeah, thanks.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.087
-Ooh.
-Ah. This place is nice.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.623
I see why Sabrina kept it
from me.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.759
-Are-are you eating
a shrimp? -Mm. Mm-hmm.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.360
Where'd you get that? We've been
here for four seconds.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.362
-I mean, boy, girl, who cares?
It's Thailand. -(men laughing)

06:35.395 --> 06:37.765
(laughs, gasps)

06:37.798 --> 06:38.766
Jimmy?

06:42.570 --> 06:44.304
-Don't freak out.
-Don't freak out?

06:44.337 --> 06:46.273
I was just down at the morgue
staring at some dead guy's ass,

06:46.306 --> 06:48.776
-wondering if it was you.
-Please be quiet, okay?

06:48.809 --> 06:50.611
I have company.
My bosses are here.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.713
-You have a job?
-Okay, listen.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.115
Come here, come here, get up.

06:55.148 --> 06:57.651
Okay, listen to me. When I got
here, things were bad, okay?

06:57.685 --> 07:00.387
I was sleeping on the streets,
I almost froze to death.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.055
And then my friend Dusty,
he gave me a sleeping bag.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.891
Now, sadly, he froze to death.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.325
So I had to put my wallet
into his pants

07:05.358 --> 07:06.727
and float him down the river.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.463
-Why? -I needed a fresh start.
Jimmy Shepherd had to go.

07:09.497 --> 07:12.633
Do not ruin this like you ruin
everything else in my life.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.734
What is that supposed to mean?

07:13.767 --> 07:15.268
It means you burnt my ass! Okay?

07:15.302 --> 07:17.905
You are the worst thing
that has ever happened to me.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.007
-WES: Yo, Benny, what is taking
so long? -Oh, yeah.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.509
Plus I stole Ben's identity.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.577
-What?
-Ho! There they are. Hey, guys.

07:23.611 --> 07:25.245
I want to introduce you
to some old friends of mine.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.815
This is Mickey, this is Alba,

07:27.848 --> 07:29.950
and this is little Jimmy.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.452
-I'm Jimmy. -You guys joining us
for dinner? -No, they're not.

07:32.486 --> 07:34.922
-They're jumping on a train...
-I could eat. -Terrific.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.990
-I'll add three to the
reservation. -ALBA: Oh, no.

07:37.024 --> 07:40.594
Ben-- Jimmy and I are going
to try and get Hamilton tickets.

07:40.628 --> 07:43.363
-I can get you tickets.
-No, Wes, come on.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.165
-We should take Dusty.
-Yeah.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.600
Boom. Tomorrow night.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.268
Two tickets waiting for you
at the box office.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.770
Shall we?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.772
(Alba chuckles)

07:51.805 --> 07:52.740
Shall we?

07:55.008 --> 07:58.445
Come on in. This right here is,
uh, is my office.

07:58.478 --> 08:02.516
Desk. The window... Also...

08:03.984 --> 08:08.722
...my bedroom. Look at this.

08:08.756 --> 08:11.058
Uh, but I know what you're
thinking, "My pop's a loser."

08:11.091 --> 08:13.393
But, you know what,
this is only temporary.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.296
Can I share with you something

08:16.329 --> 08:18.498
that I don't really share
with anybody?

08:18.532 --> 08:19.700
Sure-sure.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.869
-I guess.
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

08:21.902 --> 08:25.172
Okay.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.574
Go ahead, open it.

08:26.607 --> 08:29.877
Go ahead. It's not
an animal or nothing.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.312
Oh! Yeah. Look at that.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.481
I call it "The Gentle Man."

08:34.514 --> 08:37.250
It's a throwback to when
strip clubs had class. Right?

08:37.284 --> 08:38.485
You got yourself a-a black tie

08:38.518 --> 08:40.420
dress code,
there's a cigar room,

08:40.453 --> 08:43.557
and all the finest trim
that Florida has to offer.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.425
It's, uh... it's in Florida?

08:45.458 --> 08:47.394
You bet it's in Florida, kid.
You bet. Right?

08:47.427 --> 08:49.329
I can taste the oranges already.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.399
I-I got almost $100 grand
stashed away, off the books.

08:52.432 --> 08:53.834
RUSSIAN WOMAN:
Aw, cute!

08:53.867 --> 08:58.105
Bertie made a new friend
to share his toys with.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.173
Get out! Get out right now!

09:00.207 --> 09:02.643
(coughing)

09:03.944 --> 09:06.279
(groaning)

09:09.449 --> 09:10.784
* Need that fast cash

09:10.818 --> 09:12.586
* Big ol' bankroll

09:12.620 --> 09:13.787
* Yeah, we need
that fast cash... *

09:13.821 --> 09:14.922
Let's go. We're leaving.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.790
Already? Why? Something happen?

09:16.824 --> 09:18.692
Ew, did he touch you?
You can tell me.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.527
-No... -Actually, wait.
I don't want to know.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.595
No, he didn't touch me.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.230
I invited him over for dinner.
Let's go.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.564
Absolutely not.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.066
Wha... You're the one
who told me to meet the guy.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.567
I said you should see the guy.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.569
You're the idiot that had
to go over and talk to him.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.571
All righty. (grunts)

09:31.605 --> 09:34.608
All right, let's boogie.
Cab is on me. Okay?

09:34.642 --> 09:36.043
-Hey!
-Hey!

09:36.076 --> 09:37.210
I'm taking my cut.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.379
Then we'll do
the polenta mac and cheese,

09:39.412 --> 09:41.548
the artichoke, and a round
of clam chowders.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.883
New England or Manhattan?

09:42.916 --> 09:45.118
Come on, pal.
What city do you think this is?

09:45.152 --> 09:47.220
Every time with the chowder,
this guy.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.422
So, uh, what do you guys
do exactly?

09:49.456 --> 09:50.658
Finance.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.760
We just left Goldman and
opened up our own little shop.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.328
Shop? Like, what, like a store?

09:55.362 --> 09:56.496
(chuckles)

09:56.529 --> 09:58.065
No, Mick, like a brokerage firm,
you know?

09:58.098 --> 09:59.733
I mean, basically if there's
a buck to be made,

09:59.767 --> 10:01.434
these hounds are gonna
sniff it out.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.502
-To big Ben.
-To Ben.

10:02.535 --> 10:03.503
-(phone ringing)
-Thanks, guys.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.740
Oh, God, it's Nielsen.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.242
(sighs) Excuse me while I go
talk this idiot off a ledge.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.610
No, please, Wes.

10:10.644 --> 10:14.281
Enjoy the meal, all right?
It's what you guys pay me for.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.185
Findale Partners.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.586
Yes, Mr. Nielsen.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.521
I don't have him right now,
but can I take a message?

10:21.554 --> 10:25.358
Oh, well, I'm glad you got that
out of your system.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.194
Now, what do you really want me
to tell him?

10:30.297 --> 10:33.266
Yeah. I think that's
a very smart move,

10:33.300 --> 10:34.868
and I will send over
the paperwork

10:34.902 --> 10:37.504
first thing in the morning.

10:37.537 --> 10:39.472
Looks like you boys
got yourself another fish.

10:39.506 --> 10:40.708
He's in for $100 grand.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.976
Oh! (laughs)

10:43.010 --> 10:45.378
Whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no, no.
We got ourselves another fish.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.014
No, no, no, no, no.
That's your fish.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.149
You guys reel them in,
I just club them in the head

10:49.182 --> 10:51.484
so it doesn't bite your hand
while you rip out the hook.

10:51.518 --> 10:52.485
(laughter)

10:52.519 --> 10:54.487
You guys are fishermen now.

10:54.521 --> 10:56.857
Well, whatever it takes, Mick.

10:56.890 --> 11:00.127
Yeah, yeah. I see that. And
you're, like, their secretary.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.029
-No. I'm not the secretary.
-No?

11:02.062 --> 11:03.163
I'm the gofer.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.632
Oh, um, what's the difference?

11:05.665 --> 11:07.835
Well, a secretary
sits at the desk

11:07.868 --> 11:10.503
and lets the AC blow up
her skirt all day. You know?

11:10.537 --> 11:13.006
And I'm out there picking up
coffee and rolling calls,

11:13.040 --> 11:14.074
grabbing dry cleaning.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.575
-Yeah, yeah.
-Cheers. -Cheers.

11:15.608 --> 11:18.045
It just kind of seems
like a waste to me, fellas.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.914
-Well, how do you mean? -Well,
Ben here is a born salesman.

11:20.948 --> 11:22.850
Okay, you know what, Mick?
That's not really...

11:22.883 --> 11:24.551
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
I-I-I'm helping. -Not what...

11:24.584 --> 11:26.153
I'm helping.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.654
See, uh, he sells.
He's a seller.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.889
That's what he does.
He sells things.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.825
He always has, and he's gonna
continue to sell things

11:31.859 --> 11:33.827
'cause that's what
he's always done.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.595
So the question becomes:

11:35.628 --> 11:37.364
Is he going to be
selling for you,

11:37.397 --> 11:40.233
or is he gonna be selling
for your competitor?

11:40.267 --> 11:42.102
Okay, that's when Mick
goes over the board and...

11:42.135 --> 11:45.005
No, no, no. No. No, no, no, no.
Come on. Come on.

11:45.038 --> 11:48.375
If these guys are gonna mess
their shorts for a hundred Gs,

11:48.408 --> 11:51.044
they might as well let this dog
off the leash. Let him hunt.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.212
I'll tell you what, Ben.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.281
If you can reel in
a tuna that big,

11:54.314 --> 11:55.949
I'll give you the office
next to mine.

11:55.983 --> 11:59.552
Oh! There we go.
That sounds like a deal to me.

11:59.586 --> 12:01.088
What do you think, Ben?

12:01.121 --> 12:04.091
-That's a deal.
-Yeah!

12:04.124 --> 12:07.494
-All right!
-Big Ben the seller.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.132
Dude, that's your dad.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.967
He's not a well man, Sabrina.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.135
I'm gonna go drop a deuce.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.369
(grunts)

12:16.403 --> 12:18.438
Is the plunger already
in there, or...?

12:18.471 --> 12:19.539
I-I don't know.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.274
See if you can dig one up
for me, okay?

12:23.276 --> 12:25.412
We have to get that guy
to Florida.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.247
Had to get involved,
didn't you?!

12:27.280 --> 12:29.116
Just when I'm back
on my own two feet,

12:29.149 --> 12:31.885
you come by with a crowbar
and take me out at the knees.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.753
-Whoa! Jimmy's alive?
-And well.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.889
-Like, you look well.
-Thank you, Sabrina.

12:35.923 --> 12:36.890
I was doing well

12:36.924 --> 12:38.225
until your aunt showed up

12:38.258 --> 12:40.493
and decided to ruin
my dreams again.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.796
I'm sorry for fast-tracking
your career.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.197
I didn't want you to do that.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.934
What do you want, Jimmy?

12:46.967 --> 12:49.736
I want to put
my head down and work hard.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.405
Then, maybe someday they give me
the fancy office with the window

12:52.439 --> 12:53.907
and a chair that swivels.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.275
So a chair
is what you're after?

12:55.308 --> 12:56.309
It's something, Mick,

12:56.343 --> 12:58.178
and it's more than I've had
in a long time.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.180
What are you guys talking about?

13:00.213 --> 13:02.115
-Oh, Jimmy's mad at me 'cause
I got him a promotion. -Yeah.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.350
That's right.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.652
And all I have to do
is find a six-figure investor.

13:05.685 --> 13:07.520
Tell me, Mick, where am I
gonna find somebody

13:07.554 --> 13:08.655
with that kind of Do-Re-Mi?

13:08.688 --> 13:10.623
Do-Re-Mi?

13:10.657 --> 13:12.792
-Yeah, it's a New York thing.
-It is not a New York thing.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.461
It is. "You got that kind of
Do-Re-Mi." It means money.

13:14.494 --> 13:15.528
No one's ever said it.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.965
False alarm, kiddo.
It was all gas.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.199
I didn't know we had company.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.601
How are you?
I'm, I'm Bert Bellinger.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.503
I'm... I'm Chet's dad.

13:23.536 --> 13:24.637
-Chip.
-Yup.

13:24.671 --> 13:25.873
I recognized you
from your picture.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.340
-Thank you.
-Mm...

13:27.374 --> 13:30.310
Hey, you're-you're Chip's dad?
I'm Ben Pemberton.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.678
-What?
-I've been keeping your spot

13:31.711 --> 13:32.980
warm for a couple months.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.647
He's a great kid.
You're gonna love him.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.049
If I don't love him,
can I return him?

13:36.083 --> 13:38.185
(chuckles) I'm just kidding.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.519
Actually, you know what?

13:39.552 --> 13:41.889
I think you two might be able
to help each other.

13:46.393 --> 13:49.897
I like the way it looks. I mean,
it's-it's typed on paper.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.699
These guys are legit, Bert.
Let me ask you a question.

13:52.732 --> 13:54.367
You ever hear of Goldman Sachs?

13:54.401 --> 13:57.137
Oh, man, that's the guy
O.J. cut up, right?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.572
No, that's, uh, Ron Goldman.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.708
This is a big financial firm.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.343
Okay, that sounds impressive.
That does.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.312
Yeah. Yeah.
It's just I've been saving

14:05.345 --> 14:08.048
all of my money to open
this club in Florida.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.250
Bert, I can assure you
that everybody in this room

14:10.283 --> 14:12.719
-is fully committed to you going
to Florida. -Absolutely.

14:12.752 --> 14:16.924
I don't know. Uh, Chip.

14:16.957 --> 14:20.493
What do you think about
all this? Can you vouch?

14:20.527 --> 14:22.129
W-Well...

14:26.399 --> 14:29.202
Yeah. Yeah,
I think you should do it.

14:29.236 --> 14:32.139
I think it's a, a good idea.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.042
I'm gonna do it! I'm in.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.543
Oh, yeah!

14:36.576 --> 14:38.278
-Good job! Yeah.
-Congratulations, Bert.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.947
I'll have the guys
draw up the paperwork.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.448
-We'll sign it at dinner, yeah?
-Yes.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.018
You sure this
is the right place?

14:45.052 --> 14:47.220
I mean, it was the address
on the card.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.688
(gasps)

14:48.721 --> 14:51.591
-You know what this is?
-No.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.927
It's a boiler room.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.728
-What's that?
-Like the movie.

14:55.762 --> 14:57.530
-I haven't seen it.
-Really?

14:57.564 --> 14:59.266
These shady finance bros
who trick people

14:59.299 --> 15:01.068
into making bad investments and
then they steal all their money

15:01.101 --> 15:02.902
and spend it on Quaaludes.

15:02.936 --> 15:04.537
Ah, like fricking
Wolf of Wall Street.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.306
Didn't even see it. Nah.
Didn't look interesting to me.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.441
But this makes perfect sense.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.944
Jimmy didn't win the breakup.
I did.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.646
I won the breakup. Right?

15:13.680 --> 15:16.649
Of course I did.
And I-I got to tell you, Chip,

15:16.683 --> 15:19.819
it feels...

15:19.852 --> 15:21.888
not great.
It doesn't feel great.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.625
Oh, Jimmy. Oh, man.
He was so excited about this.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.327
My dad is pouring all his money
into this.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.761
I... I-I got to stop him.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.663
No, no, no, no. No.
Don't do that.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.565
'Cause if Jimmy finds out
he stepped in crap again,

15:32.599 --> 15:33.800
it'll kill him.

15:33.833 --> 15:36.069
And I mean that literally.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.737
He might...
he might kill himself.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.672
Come on, Benito. This way.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.308
-Yeah, yeah.
-I want candy.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.310
What... okay. Quickly.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.811
-What do you want?
-MAN: What can I get for you?

15:44.844 --> 15:47.347
-I want chocolate,
I want gummies -Okay.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.249
and I want Pixie Scoop
for Dusty.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.251
Okay. Uh, and a white wine.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.020
You know, in case
Dusty gets thirsty.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.989
*

15:58.992 --> 16:01.828
-Hey.
-Oh, hey.

16:01.861 --> 16:03.263
Music down.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.931
-(music fades)
-FEMALE VOICE: Music down.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.467
-What are you drinking?
-A Manhattan.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.037
Really leaning into
this Manhattan thing, huh?

16:10.070 --> 16:11.304
Greatest city in the world.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.939
Huh. I remember you
calling New York

16:12.972 --> 16:15.542
the unwiped anus of America.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.444
Jimmy Shepherd said that.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.779
He said a lot of dumb things.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.681
Yes. That's definitely true.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.283
He was a child, Mick.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.453
I stand before you
a man in a suit.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.288
Jimmy, are you sure
you want to do this?

16:28.321 --> 16:29.289
All right, you know what?

16:29.322 --> 16:30.557
I know what you're doing,
and stop it.

16:30.590 --> 16:31.458
Stop what?

16:31.491 --> 16:33.160
This pathetic jealous charade.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.394
Why would I be jealous?

16:34.427 --> 16:36.563
Uh, I don't know, maybe
because I won the breakup.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.631
You can't win a breakup.
That's ludicrous.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.167
-(phone ringing)
-I got to take this.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.568
No... just wait a second.
I have to tell you something...

16:41.601 --> 16:42.869
No. I don't want to hear it.
All right?

16:42.902 --> 16:44.804
I am done playing
your little mind games.

16:44.837 --> 16:48.041
For the first time in a long
time, I'm proud to be me.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.476
Ben Pemberton.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.044
-Come on, Jimmy.
-Yeah, buddy.

16:51.078 --> 16:53.213
I'm on my way.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.747
That's how you wave now?

16:54.781 --> 16:57.084
Music. Jazz.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.852
-(jazz music playing)
-FEMALE VOICE: Jazz.

16:59.886 --> 17:02.021
I mean, there's this
primordial goo, right?

17:02.055 --> 17:03.856
They're inside of it. Their
mouth becomes their butt...

17:03.890 --> 17:05.725
Four Manhattan clam chowders.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.594
Careful. They are hot.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.762
Uh. Whoa. I didn't...
I didn't order this.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.364
I ordered it, Bert. Okay?

17:11.398 --> 17:13.733
Because here at Findale
Partners, we take care of you.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.668
So, whether we're putting soup
in your belly

17:15.702 --> 17:17.437
or money in your pocket,
I want you to know

17:17.470 --> 17:19.072
that as soon as you hand over
that check...

17:19.106 --> 17:21.908
-Cash.
-What's that?

17:21.941 --> 17:24.111
I brought a lot of cash.
I hope that's okay.

17:24.144 --> 17:27.046
WES:
You brought... oh.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.848
Oh. Oh.

17:28.881 --> 17:29.916
Brought cash.

17:29.949 --> 17:32.419
We will make it work.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.753
All right, we're in business.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.021
WES:
I'll hold that if you want.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.956
No? Okay.

17:36.989 --> 17:38.858
Are those idiots
eating more chowder?

17:38.891 --> 17:40.393
CHIP:
Shh. They're coming.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.862
MICKEY:
Soup's on, boys.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.397
Gentlemen, so sorry
to interrupt your dinner.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.433
-We're with the IRS. -Can't you
see that we are with a client

17:46.466 --> 17:48.601
-right now? -No. You know what,
Wes? I can handle this.

17:48.635 --> 17:49.936
And you're also with the firm?

17:49.969 --> 17:52.139
No. Not officially,
but I will be soon.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.940
Ben Pemberton.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.409
Nice, Jimmy. Hand your fake ID
to a federal agent.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.978
(laughter)

17:59.011 --> 18:00.447
-JIMMY: That's what I'm saying.
-What is happening?

18:00.480 --> 18:01.914
-Absolutely.
-Am I a walrus?

18:01.948 --> 18:03.483
I don't know. Maybe I'm...

18:03.516 --> 18:05.285
Arrest those frickin' boilers.

18:05.318 --> 18:08.555
-Well, everything seems
to be above board here. -Yeah.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.989
-Sorry for the inconvenience.
-Absolutely.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.424
And you have our information
if you need it.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.326
(clearing throat):
Yeah, thank you.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.396
Oh. I don't think
I got your name.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.064
Ah, my...
(clears throat)

18:18.097 --> 18:19.266
...mine? Me?

18:19.299 --> 18:20.667
Yeah. My name is, uh, you know,

18:20.700 --> 18:22.602
I'm just...
(grunts)

18:23.703 --> 18:26.005
Oh! Oh!

18:26.038 --> 18:28.007
Oh! Oh! Oh!

18:28.040 --> 18:30.643
(overlapping shouting)

18:30.677 --> 18:32.512
-Secure him, secure him. -Oh,
no, sir! These are my dreams.

18:32.545 --> 18:33.946
-Don't fight me.
-Get off of me.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.115
It's not Florida,
but that'll work.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.189
(laughs) Amazing! I...
Five stars. Two thumbs up.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.923
-It was incredible!
-Yeah.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.359
-Do you think Dusty liked it?
-Oh, Dusty loved it.

18:46.393 --> 18:48.328
You know what? I think Dusty
loved it so much,

18:48.361 --> 18:50.763
that we should
scatter his ashes here,

18:50.797 --> 18:52.532
under the bright lights
of Broadway.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.834
-That's a great idea.
-Yeah.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.503
Yeah. Hey, Dusty,
what do you think of that?

18:56.536 --> 18:58.705
Sound good to you?

18:58.738 --> 19:00.973
Ben, I-I thought you ate
the Pixie Scoop.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.543
I did.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.313
Oh, boy.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.780
I'm cooperating.
What's the matter with you?

19:07.814 --> 19:09.649
Hey, get off of me.
That's my money, anyway.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.384
Who's got it?
You want to tax something?

19:11.418 --> 19:12.852
Why don't you tax my ass?

19:12.885 --> 19:15.121
I need more tape.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.557
How you doing, Jimmy?

19:17.590 --> 19:19.192
Some idiot called in and said

19:19.226 --> 19:20.960
we were running a boiler room
out of the offices.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.829
We haven't even moved
into the offices.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.665
-Huh.
-JIMMY: Oh.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.734
Guys, I owe you a big apology.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.470
-No, it's fine.
-Really?

19:30.503 --> 19:32.171
Well, obviously we can't work
with you anymore.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.640
WES:
Also, that cop said your name's

19:33.673 --> 19:37.910
not even Ben, which... is weird.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.746
Yeah.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.114
We got to go.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.153
-Jimmy.
-No. No.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.756
-I am a loser.
-You are not a loser.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.157
I am, Mick. I got nothing.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.559
I'm just some freak

19:52.592 --> 19:55.262
with burned-up genitals
and an ass to match.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.564
Listen, um...

20:00.032 --> 20:03.670
...some people just have
bad luck. You know?

20:03.703 --> 20:05.572
Yeah. Thanks.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.041
Yeah.

20:09.075 --> 20:10.176
Do you want some help?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.944
(exhales)
No, no, no.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.880
I got to learn how
to do this on my own.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.615
(groans)

20:17.717 --> 20:21.120
I'll see you around, Mick.

20:21.153 --> 20:22.355
Well...

20:22.389 --> 20:24.657
(groans) Just...

20:25.792 --> 20:27.594
Jimmy!

20:29.729 --> 20:30.930
Jimmy!

20:30.963 --> 20:32.465
Mick, I'm not in the mood.

20:32.499 --> 20:34.501
I did it.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.104
Did what?

20:38.137 --> 20:40.307
I did all of it. Your ass,
your, you know, your nuts.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.042
I burned them all.
It was all me.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.944
Why?

20:44.977 --> 20:46.813
(laughs):
I don't know. I mean, your ass

20:46.846 --> 20:48.815
'cause I thought it'd be funny.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.083
It didn't...
it didn't turn out to be.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.586
But your nuts, that was because
I didn't want you

20:53.620 --> 20:55.455
to get mixed up
in a boiler room.

20:55.488 --> 20:56.756
-You did that?
-Yeah.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.391
It was all me.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.226
Everything bad that's
ever happened in your life,

21:00.259 --> 21:02.194
it was 'cause of me, not you.

21:03.463 --> 21:06.366
And you won the breakup.

21:08.468 --> 21:11.838
No, Mickey.
I didn't win the br...

21:11.871 --> 21:13.806
I lost.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.976
I lost you.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.381
Can you come home?

21:22.849 --> 21:25.318
Ugh.

21:25.352 --> 21:27.019
It... You just...

21:27.053 --> 21:28.588
You stink like clams.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.623
-Yeah. I've been eating
a lot of chowder. -Mm-hmm.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.258
Cool. Can you...?

21:32.291 --> 21:34.861
-Oh, yeah. -Yeah, I just don't
want it on me, you know.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.863
Right.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.366
-Let's go home.
-Yeah.

21:42.001 --> 21:42.969
You all right there?

21:43.002 --> 21:44.637
I mean, you burned my nuts off.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.172
Are we gonna start
with this already?

21:46.205 --> 21:47.173
Well, that's what happened.

21:47.206 --> 21:48.975
I said I was sorry.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.044
MICKEY: Your ass, nuts--
I burned them all.

I can help you.
