Hubert, great work
on the cafeteria gravy story.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.882
Answered a lot of questions
but raised a lot more.

00:14.915 --> 00:16.350
(door opens)

00:16.384 --> 00:20.988
I come bearing the thing
you journalists hate most: news.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.491
The Daily Fourth Gradian
is hemorrhaging money.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.493
Last month the paper lost...

00:25.526 --> 00:27.528
$32.

00:27.561 --> 00:28.696
(all gasping)

00:28.729 --> 00:30.731
But you can't put a price
on the truth.

00:30.764 --> 00:33.067
I finally got a source
to go on the record

00:33.101 --> 00:35.002
about dodgeball concussions.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.004
Bombardment, bombardment.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.940
(crying):
Bombardment.

00:39.973 --> 00:42.776
I'm sorry, but I have no choice
but to bring in a new editor.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.245
The fifth grader who somehow

00:44.278 --> 00:46.114
turned
the school poetry magazine

00:46.147 --> 00:49.950
into a cash-blasting fire hose:
Billy.

00:49.983 --> 00:52.553
Preschool is over, news skanks.

you're a real talent.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.630
Get out. You're fired.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.465
See? No one's safe.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.037
Hubert's a good journalist.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.706
Good journalism ain't paying
the pizza man, toots.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.975
We are going online only:

01:15.008 --> 01:17.645
pop-culture quizzes,
sponsored lists,

01:17.678 --> 01:19.880
headlines that grab you
by the book bag:

01:19.913 --> 01:22.416
"You Won't Believe
What Milhouse Looks Like Now."

01:22.450 --> 01:24.084
You bet your book bag I won't.

01:24.118 --> 01:26.220
But you can't just turn
the school paper

01:26.254 --> 01:27.621

01:27.655 --> 01:29.390

-I'm a recapper.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.067
Huh? What?

01:40.100 --> 01:41.969
A TV recapper.

01:42.002 --> 01:45.139
I watch every episode of a show,
then write a summary,

01:45.173 --> 01:48.142
followed by snarky comments
and a letter grade.

01:48.176 --> 01:49.977
Well, sometimes I do worry

01:50.010 --> 01:53.814
I have the wrong opinions
about what I've just seen.

spew out an endless stream

02:03.491 --> 02:05.759

02:05.793 --> 02:07.995

at Thanksgiving

02:08.028 --> 02:10.631
and stuffing at Halloween.

02:10.664 --> 02:14.302

of strong opinions.

02:14.335 --> 02:17.305

a familiar formula,

10:35.836 --> 10:37.504

19:33.673 --> 19:36.309
He gave Outlander a B-minus.

19:36.343 --> 19:39.646
That show knows what it wants
to be. Come on.

19:39.679 --> 19:43.483
Ooh, I've heard that gets really
good about eight episodes in.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.151
Krusty, you're free to go.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.086
-(laughs)
-Mmm.

19:47.119 --> 19:48.588
(elephant trumpets)

19:50.022 --> 19:52.992
Is there room on that train
for one more clown?

19:53.025 --> 19:54.894
Well, he did save the circus.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.329
What do you say, Scuzzo?

19:56.363 --> 19:59.332
(crying):
Please, I'm not Krusty anymore.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.601
I'm a circus clown.

20:01.634 --> 20:04.737
I'm Soggy.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.006
You're a, you're a TV clown.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.577
The greatest TV clown
I've ever had the honor to know.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.078
But you're a traitor
to our kind.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.126
Goodbye, circus.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.561
Goodbye.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.597
(gurgles)

20:35.302 --> 20:38.271
-(Mr. Teeny grumbles)
-Another terrible show.

20:38.305 --> 20:41.274
-Thanks a lot, Chris Pine.
-(chatters)

20:42.642 --> 20:44.611
And now the bad recap.

20:44.644 --> 20:47.880
They always find some new chump
to tear me down.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.749
"A"? I got an "A"?

20:49.782 --> 20:51.818
Everything I've ever done
has been great!

20:51.851 --> 20:53.820
I'll never be sad again.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.822
(both chuckling)

20:55.855 --> 20:57.490
"A" is for Ralph.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.505
Dad, look, they posted our story
this morning.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.474
Hmm.

21:14.507 --> 21:17.477
Together we've exposed
the truth.

21:17.510 --> 21:20.146
It'll be the one legitimate
piece of journalism

21:20.179 --> 21:21.748
on the whole site.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.651
What's with this boring
Peak TV article?

21:24.684 --> 21:27.587
My patience is growing shorter
than Rachel Maddow's crew cut.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.456
How many times do I have
to tell you:

21:29.489 --> 21:30.990
no bait, no clicks.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.625
Hey, you, yeah, gummy bear,

21:32.659 --> 21:34.927
put up a slideshow
that'll get me some eyeballs.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.363
Eyeballs!

21:38.398 --> 21:40.400

21:44.036 --> 21:46.038
Ooh.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.077
Shh!
