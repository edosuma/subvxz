00:07.760 --> 00:09.560
Let's go!
Let's go!

00:09.590 --> 00:10.720
Okay, everybody.
This is it!

00:10.760 --> 00:12.330
The activity fair.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.630
A great opportunity for you guys

00:13.660 --> 00:15.730
to blend in with the big kids.

00:15.760 --> 00:18.730
Well, then, not so sure the
preschool safety rope is helping.

00:20.740 --> 00:23.670
Look, as advisor
to the A.N.T. Program,

00:23.710 --> 00:26.440
I need to make sure that you all stay safe,

00:26.470 --> 00:29.680
so that I don't get fired.

00:29.710 --> 00:33.380
So, if you get lost, just
blow your panic whistle.

00:34.650 --> 00:38.450
Gibson, are you lost again?

00:38.490 --> 00:41.320
Nope, not a problem anymore,
Principal Skidmore.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.660
My A.N.T. Pad
has a GPS app.

00:49.330 --> 00:51.300
As soon as I learn to speak Korean,

00:51.330 --> 00:52.630
this will be really helpful.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.310
Wow, look at all these choices!

00:58.340 --> 01:01.610
Physics Club, French Club.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.640
Ooh! Club Sandwich Club!

01:08.620 --> 01:10.280
What are you doing?

01:11.320 --> 01:14.320
Chyna, this school is a jungle.

01:14.360 --> 01:16.390
We're baby gazelles, prancing around,

01:16.420 --> 01:18.330
all wide-eyed
and innocent.

01:18.360 --> 01:19.530
"Oh, look, a watering hole.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.530
"I think I'll stop
and take a drink."

01:23.260 --> 01:24.600
Next thing you know, snap!

01:24.630 --> 01:28.340
A crocodile bites your head off!

01:28.370 --> 01:30.570
You really need to stop
watching those nature specials.

01:30.610 --> 01:33.470
Sometimes, they show them pooping.

01:36.640 --> 01:40.250
Look, we're only required to do
one extracurricular activity

01:40.280 --> 01:42.350
and you already signed up
for the school musical.

01:42.380 --> 01:43.420
To audition.

01:43.450 --> 01:44.650
But I'm up against Lexi,

01:44.690 --> 01:46.320
so who knows if I'll even get a good part.

01:46.350 --> 01:47.520
I mean, the play could be <i>Cats,</i>

01:47.560 --> 01:50.320
and I could end up being the litter box.

01:52.690 --> 01:54.360
Hello, ladies.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.630
Ooh! See?
There you go.

01:56.660 --> 01:58.500
Fletcher's getting into
the spirit of things.

01:58.530 --> 02:00.400
He's signing up for the Renaissance Club.

02:00.440 --> 02:04.570
No! I'm wearing this to protect
myself from the big kids.

02:04.610 --> 02:08.210
Hey, could you pull that down for me?

02:08.240 --> 02:10.580
Yeah. While I'm inside
this, nothing can hurt me.

02:17.320 --> 02:21.490
Wow, the Physics Club is
very desperate for members.

Whoo!

03:14.310 --> 03:17.480
Try out for cheer!
Sign up here!

03:17.510 --> 03:20.410
Jump up and wave your arms!

03:20.450 --> 03:22.420
Don't set off the fire alarms!

03:24.620 --> 03:27.350
What?
That's a really good message.

03:30.290 --> 03:32.390
Cameron, you joined Photography Club?

03:32.430 --> 03:33.530
Nope.

03:34.530 --> 03:35.560
Yearbook?

03:35.600 --> 03:37.230
Nope.

03:38.500 --> 03:39.500
Uh-oh.

03:41.340 --> 03:42.540
There's Lexi,

03:42.570 --> 03:44.470
the biggest,
of them all.odile.

03:44.510 --> 03:46.440
Unfortunately, unlike the chameleon

03:46.470 --> 03:48.580
or the Indonesian mimic octopus,

03:48.610 --> 03:51.480
we have no natural camouflage abilities.

03:53.210 --> 03:54.580
Oh, maybe we do.

03:54.620 --> 03:56.550
Here, just put that on.

04:02.590 --> 04:03.620
Hey, Chyna.

04:06.260 --> 04:08.300
What are you so happy about?

04:11.370 --> 04:13.370
Hey, Lexi.
Hey, Paisley.

04:19.540 --> 04:21.510
So, Chyna,

04:21.540 --> 04:23.410
are you going to try out for cheerleading?

04:23.440 --> 04:25.310
You totally should.

04:25.550 --> 04:27.210
You think?

04:27.250 --> 04:30.150
Don't stop to drink!
Don't stop to drink!

04:30.180 --> 04:31.350
Yeah, you'd be great!

04:31.390 --> 04:33.190
You're good at music and dance.

04:33.220 --> 04:35.620
And you've got a really great smile.

04:37.390 --> 04:38.530
Maybe I will sign up.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.330
I can't let you do this.

04:40.630 --> 04:42.260
Ow!

04:44.600 --> 04:48.270
Ooh! I found a pen.
Score!

04:51.170 --> 04:53.310
Forget it.
I am not joining the cheerleaders.

04:53.340 --> 04:56.140
It goes against everything
I stand for as a feminist.

04:56.180 --> 04:57.440
Plus, I'm scared of them.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.410
Besides, we'd make total
fools of ourselves.

05:01.450 --> 05:03.450
My dad says if you really
commit to something

05:03.480 --> 05:06.320
and do your best, you will
never look like a fool.

05:06.350 --> 05:08.420
Of course, he wears black
knee socks with sandals,

05:08.460 --> 05:10.260
but we will overlook that.

05:12.130 --> 05:15.230
Come on, it won't be fun
unless we do it together.

05:15.260 --> 05:17.360
Well, I'm nothing if not fun.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.530
Oh, hey, Fletcher.

05:21.570 --> 05:24.140
How did it go at the Chess Club?

05:24.170 --> 05:25.310
Not well.

05:31.350 --> 05:33.580
Next up is Alive.

05:33.610 --> 05:35.280
Um, my name is Olive.

05:35.320 --> 05:36.480
Oh, okay, Olive!

05:36.520 --> 05:39.220
You can go since this Alive
girl didn't show up.

05:41.490 --> 05:42.560
Okay,

05:42.590 --> 05:45.230
I'm going to do a cheer that I wrote myself

05:45.260 --> 05:47.590
in honor of our beloved
team, the Webster Wolves.

05:50.360 --> 05:53.130
Wolves are tough!
Wolves are strong!

05:53.170 --> 05:55.500
Wolves are typically
60-inches long!

05:55.540 --> 05:58.410
<i>Canis lupus</i>
<i>they're called in Latin!</i>

05:58.440 --> 06:01.470
On badgers, mice, and fox they fatten!

06:01.510 --> 06:04.480
Howling consists of
a fundamental frequency,

06:04.510 --> 06:07.410
which lies between 150 and 780 hertz,

06:07.450 --> 06:10.450
and consists of up to 12
harmonically related overtones!

06:13.250 --> 06:14.490
Why are you blowing your whistle?

06:14.520 --> 06:16.120
Is someone lost?

06:20.430 --> 06:25.100
Olive, your cheer was very educational.

06:25.130 --> 06:26.270
I learned that

06:26.300 --> 06:27.470
I hate you.

06:27.500 --> 06:28.570
Next!

06:32.240 --> 06:33.270
Mmm.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.140
Ka-hyna?

06:35.180 --> 06:37.280
It's Chyna.

06:37.310 --> 06:40.210
People shouldn't sign up
if they're not going to show.

06:42.550 --> 06:44.250
Okay. So.

06:45.590 --> 06:48.120
Shake it to the left!
Shake it to the right!

06:48.160 --> 06:50.190
Stand up, Wolves, and fight, fight, fight!

06:50.220 --> 06:52.290
Push them back!
Push them back!

06:52.330 --> 06:54.330
Wolves attack!

06:54.360 --> 06:57.200
Ow! My nose!

06:57.230 --> 06:59.270
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry!

06:59.300 --> 07:00.530
I think it's bleeding!

07:00.570 --> 07:03.370
Oh, wait, no, you're supposed
to tilt your head forward.

07:04.270 --> 07:05.410
Ow!

07:10.540 --> 07:13.250
My wolf cheer isn't looking
so bad now, is it?

07:20.290 --> 07:23.160
Uh, I must have the wrong room.

07:23.190 --> 07:26.030
I was hoping to join
the End Hunger Today Club?

07:26.060 --> 07:27.130
Sorry,

07:27.160 --> 07:29.130
we're full.

07:31.370 --> 07:34.170
But there is no one here except you.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.070
Fine. Look,
we'll take a vote.

07:37.100 --> 07:39.240
All in favor of letting
Fletcher into the club?

07:40.470 --> 07:42.180
All opposed?

07:44.150 --> 07:46.180
Sorry, it's unanimous.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.420
Are you even trying to end hunger?

07:50.450 --> 07:52.420
You're just eating Buffalo wings.

07:52.450 --> 07:55.160
And thus, ending my hunger.

07:55.190 --> 07:57.460
I feel if I can help just one person, then,

07:57.490 --> 07:59.290
I'm making a difference.

08:00.290 --> 08:01.530
So the End Hunger Today Club

08:01.560 --> 08:04.400
just uses school funds
to buy Buffalo wings?

08:04.430 --> 08:06.430
That was the founder's vision.

08:11.340 --> 08:13.110
Mmm.

08:13.140 --> 08:16.340
Well, I don't think Principal
Skidmore would approve of this.

08:17.380 --> 08:20.250
What's your point, Ant?

08:20.280 --> 08:24.050
Let me in your club or I'll tell
her about your little scam.

08:25.390 --> 08:28.120
Everyone, let's welcome
our new member, Fletcher!

08:32.330 --> 08:34.190
Well, Olive, you were right.

08:34.230 --> 08:36.260
Our tryouts were a complete disaster.

08:36.299 --> 08:38.130
We'll do something else together.

08:40.470 --> 08:44.400
Uh, Paisley, I am so, so,
so sorry about your nose.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.140
Oh, don't be.

08:46.170 --> 08:47.240
I'm hoping it's broken,

08:47.270 --> 08:50.240
so my mom will finally
let me get a nose job!

08:52.080 --> 08:55.080
So, Chyna, about your audition...

08:55.120 --> 08:56.420
No, it's okay.

08:56.450 --> 08:58.520
Being a cheerleader isn't
even important to us anymore.

08:58.550 --> 09:01.420
Olive and I are going to find
something better to do together.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.020
Chyna, you made the squad!

09:05.060 --> 09:06.330
Oh, my gosh!
I'm a cheerleader!

09:06.360 --> 09:09.130
This is the greatest day of my life!

09:09.160 --> 09:12.330
Oh, and by the way, Olive, even
though you didn't make the squad,

09:12.370 --> 09:14.030
I did type up your wolf cheer

09:14.070 --> 09:16.270
and turn it in as my biology paper.

09:16.300 --> 09:18.200
A-plus.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.270
Come on, Chyna.
Let's go get your uniform.

09:25.210 --> 09:27.110
Hey, Olive.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.480
Aw, you look sad.

09:30.180 --> 09:31.280
Tissue?

09:40.440 --> 09:42.500
Angus! Angus!
He's our man.

09:42.530 --> 09:45.430
If he can't hack into the
CIA classified database,

09:45.470 --> 09:46.700
nobody can!

09:48.800 --> 09:51.500
Hey, uh, why are you talking like that?

09:51.540 --> 09:52.810
Lexi says to do it right,

09:52.840 --> 09:54.670
I must cheer both day and night!

09:57.750 --> 10:00.710
Okay, um, where were you at lunch?

10:00.750 --> 10:02.550
Sorry I didn't eat with you!

10:02.580 --> 10:04.620
Cheerleaders met
from 1:00 to 2:00!

10:07.760 --> 10:09.760
Uh, fine. Um.

10:09.790 --> 10:11.660
Hey, wanna come over after school then?

10:11.690 --> 10:15.560
We can make historical hats for my turtle.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.430
The squad is getting their hair done!

10:17.460 --> 10:18.770
Lexi says it's lots of fun!

10:18.800 --> 10:20.570
Can I take a rain check...

10:20.600 --> 10:22.570
Cheer again, I'll punch your neck.

10:25.470 --> 10:27.570
I can't believe you're
making friends with Lexi.

10:27.610 --> 10:29.680
I mean, it's not natural.

10:29.710 --> 10:34.580
Have you ever seen a gazelle and a
crocodile sign each other's yearbooks?

10:34.620 --> 10:36.520
She's not so bad!
Now I have to leave!

10:36.550 --> 10:38.450
It takes forever to get a weave!

10:40.650 --> 10:42.760
Well...
Whatever!

10:42.790 --> 10:44.720
I have plenty of other friends!

10:44.760 --> 10:48.460
I'll just hang out with Angus instead!

10:48.500 --> 10:51.500
All right! I've been
waiting for this moment.

11:09.420 --> 11:11.820
As President of the End Hunger Today Club,

11:11.850 --> 11:13.820
I call this meeting to order.

11:13.850 --> 11:16.690
First item of business, Buffalo wings.

11:18.860 --> 11:20.590
Uh, President?

11:20.630 --> 11:22.860
I don't remember us having an election.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.830
Fine, look, we'll have an election.

11:24.870 --> 11:26.700
Who votes for Cameron?

11:32.570 --> 11:35.680
I can't help it.
You're just so darn charismatic.

11:35.710 --> 11:36.810
Okay.

11:36.840 --> 11:38.850
So, what did you order?

11:38.880 --> 11:42.650
"Mild, mild medium, medium, medium hot,

11:42.680 --> 11:45.890
"hot, extra hot, or 'Ah!
Get this out of my mouth!'"

11:45.920 --> 11:47.620
Just see for yourself.

11:50.860 --> 11:53.760
Aah! Get this
out of my mouth!

11:53.790 --> 11:55.860
Actually, those are the medium.

11:55.900 --> 11:57.930
I don't care, get this out of my mouth.

12:02.700 --> 12:04.600
Ready?
Okay!

12:04.640 --> 12:06.570
Front to back!
Left to right!

12:06.610 --> 12:08.740
Come on, Wolves!
Let's fight, fight, fight!

12:13.410 --> 12:14.410
Oh!

12:16.850 --> 12:20.690
Chyna, you may be an Ant, but
you need to sound like a Wolf.

12:20.720 --> 12:21.750
Oh.

12:27.630 --> 12:28.830
Just be louder.

12:28.860 --> 12:30.400
Okay.

12:30.430 --> 12:31.760
Let's form a cheer line!

12:36.640 --> 12:37.670
Ow!

12:37.710 --> 12:38.710
Ooh!

12:42.480 --> 12:44.680
Okay, let's work on our basket toss.

12:44.710 --> 12:45.850
Yay!

12:48.620 --> 12:51.820
Chyna!
Get in the basket.

12:51.850 --> 12:54.390
Did you say basket or casket?

12:54.420 --> 12:55.720
Come on, it's fun!

12:56.590 --> 12:57.660
Okay.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.560
Ready?

13:02.600 --> 13:03.830
No, actually...

13:07.500 --> 13:08.600
Where'd she go?

13:08.640 --> 13:10.370
I'm over here.

13:12.080 --> 13:14.670
Can somebody please help me down?

13:18.280 --> 13:19.480
Never mind.

13:21.180 --> 13:23.350
Okay, now we practice
pom-poms.

13:23.380 --> 13:26.190
Good.
That sounds safer.

13:26.220 --> 13:28.190
For night games!

13:28.220 --> 13:30.220
Hot! Hot!

13:31.630 --> 13:33.430
It's too bad we don't have marshmallows.

13:33.460 --> 13:35.360
We can make s'mores.

13:42.370 --> 13:45.240
Okay, Chyna, why don't you
lead us in the final cheer?

13:45.270 --> 13:46.510
Come on!
Nice and loud!

13:46.540 --> 13:50.210
Big smile!
Let me see those teeth!

13:50.240 --> 13:52.580
I think there may be a couple
over there on the floor.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.420
Ready? Let's go!

13:58.450 --> 13:59.590
Give me a "W"!

13:59.620 --> 14:01.150
"W"!

14:01.190 --> 14:03.220
Give me an "O"!
"O"!

14:03.260 --> 14:05.190
Give me a...

14:11.300 --> 14:13.500
Oh, no!
You lost your voice?

14:15.140 --> 14:16.540
This is terrible.

14:16.570 --> 14:20.210
Now, you won't be able to
lead us in the final cheer

14:22.140 --> 14:24.610
or audition for the
school musical tomorrow.

14:27.550 --> 14:32.250
Oh, are those tears coming out of
your one eye that isn't swollen shut?

14:35.360 --> 14:37.520
Sorry, I don't have any tissues.

14:40.330 --> 14:42.360
Someone say they needed a tissue?

14:57.090 --> 15:00.090
Care to make a donation?
Donation.

15:00.120 --> 15:01.930
Care to make a donation?

15:01.960 --> 15:03.130
Mr. Zimbaldi.

15:03.160 --> 15:05.260
Care to make a donation
a better place? E world.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.100
Are you trying to cure baldness?

15:07.130 --> 15:08.300
No.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.870
There you are, man.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.140
Look, I've been sitting here for an hour

15:15.170 --> 15:16.970
and all we've got is 35 cents,

15:17.010 --> 15:19.180
a chewed up piece of gum,
and an arcade ticket.

15:19.210 --> 15:20.980
Ooh, I collect those.

15:21.010 --> 15:22.250
What's the point?

15:22.280 --> 15:24.210
You need like a million
tickets to get anything good.

15:24.250 --> 15:27.120
No, I meant the chewed up gum.

15:27.150 --> 15:29.320
Look, you said we were going to make money!

15:29.350 --> 15:31.920
But nobody's giving us anything.

15:31.960 --> 15:34.160
They just need a little incentive.

15:37.160 --> 15:40.000
Oprah? How did you get
Oprah to endorse us?

15:40.030 --> 15:43.000
I simply looked up the number
to her headquarters in Chicago,

15:43.030 --> 15:46.340
called her, and when they wouldn't put
me through, I made the poster anyway.

15:51.140 --> 15:53.010
Uh-huh.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.080
Usually when I cornrow Chyna's hair,

15:55.110 --> 15:58.110
I don't actually find corn in it.

15:58.150 --> 16:01.120
Oh, so that's where that went!

16:02.950 --> 16:04.920
Ew, gross.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.220
If you're going to be all judgy,

16:06.260 --> 16:08.320
maybe you should find
someone else to play with.

16:16.930 --> 16:18.130
No, Angus!

16:21.140 --> 16:23.040
You'll come around.

16:30.980 --> 16:32.080
Ugh!

16:33.350 --> 16:36.150
Chyna?
What happened to you?

16:37.320 --> 16:39.020
You lost your voice?

16:40.260 --> 16:42.030
Then act out what happened.

16:44.300 --> 16:48.360
You were at the airport
helping planes land.

16:55.370 --> 16:59.940
Oh, oh, oh! But the union guys didn't like
that, did they? So they roughed you up.

17:02.380 --> 17:04.210
Use the voice app
on my A.N.T. Pad.

17:04.250 --> 17:06.119
Just type in what you want to say.

17:13.190 --> 17:14.319
Use your tongue.

17:21.030 --> 17:25.839
<i>You wore rigatoni about Lexi.</i>
<i>She is oval.</i>

17:25.869 --> 17:28.870
<i>I shoulder have</i>
<i>licensed to you.</i>

17:28.910 --> 17:30.940
Oh, my gosh.
Lexi did this?

17:33.280 --> 17:35.080
<i>I am soupy.</i>

17:36.010 --> 17:37.880
Apology accepted.

17:40.280 --> 17:41.320
<i>Ow.</i>

17:43.890 --> 17:46.090
Well, what are you going
to do about the musical?

17:47.290 --> 17:48.860
What?

17:48.890 --> 17:50.860
Look, but you have to audition.

17:51.960 --> 17:54.260
You may be bloodied, grotesque and

17:54.300 --> 17:56.070
near impossible to look at,

17:57.970 --> 18:00.940
but as my best friend once said,

18:00.970 --> 18:03.910
"If you really commit to
something and do your best,

18:03.940 --> 18:05.980
"you'll never
look like a fool."

18:06.010 --> 18:08.140
I don't remember saying that.

18:12.120 --> 18:13.920
This is fantastic.

18:13.950 --> 18:18.050
Like for so many others,
our dreams come true.

18:18.090 --> 18:19.890
Yeah.

18:19.920 --> 18:22.960
But instead of the bling
bling, we got the wing wing!

18:25.130 --> 18:28.060
Don't ever say that again.

18:28.100 --> 18:30.200
Seriously, strike that from the minutes.

18:32.840 --> 18:36.310
So, this is the End Hunger Today Club?

18:37.210 --> 18:39.040
It was his idea!

18:39.080 --> 18:40.280
Oh, Cameron.

18:40.310 --> 18:42.280
You should be commended.

18:42.310 --> 18:45.250
It's wonderful to see students

18:45.280 --> 18:48.150
get behind a worthwhile cause like this.

18:48.190 --> 18:51.990
Well, Principal Skidmore, the
one hunger that will never end

18:52.020 --> 18:54.090
is my hunger to help people.

18:54.120 --> 18:56.130
Uh-oh, our wings are here!

18:56.160 --> 18:59.900
Uh, he means our angel wings,

18:59.930 --> 19:03.130
which we've earned by doing such good work.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.040
What?
These are Buffalo wings.

19:09.070 --> 19:11.170
Get these out of my sight.

19:11.210 --> 19:13.140
Just set them outside.

19:13.180 --> 19:14.980
Wait!

19:15.010 --> 19:17.210
I know what's going on here.

19:17.250 --> 19:20.780
You two have created a fake club

19:20.820 --> 19:23.890
and are using school funds
and fraudulent donations

19:23.920 --> 19:26.190
to sit here and eat Buffalo wings!

19:26.220 --> 19:27.960
He thought up the fundraiser!
He started the club!

19:27.990 --> 19:30.830
I am an innocent pawn.
And he the one that called Oprah!

19:30.860 --> 19:32.930
I don't care who did what.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.160
What's important here is...

19:35.230 --> 19:36.770
I want in!

19:40.140 --> 19:41.800
Thank you.

19:41.840 --> 19:42.970
<i>Next!</i>

19:44.140 --> 19:45.780
<i>Lexi! Lexi...</i>

19:45.810 --> 19:48.780
Oh, there you are.

19:48.810 --> 19:52.110
For my audition, I will be
singing a song that I wrote.

19:54.250 --> 19:58.150
<i>♪ Marshmallow marshes</i>
<i>and gumdrop trees</i>

19:58.190 --> 20:02.160

20:10.870 --> 20:13.100
Aw, wonderful, Lexi!

20:13.140 --> 20:15.240
That was so sweet, I'm worried
about my blood sugar.

20:15.270 --> 20:16.940
Oh, thank you.

20:16.970 --> 20:18.170
No, seriously, I may faint.

20:20.910 --> 20:22.250
Next up, uh, Chyna!

20:22.280 --> 20:24.910
<i>Chyna! Chyna!</i>

20:26.050 --> 20:28.020

20:33.990 --> 20:34.990
Okay.

20:56.150 --> 20:58.850
What are you all looking at?

20:58.880 --> 21:00.120
Stop staring at me!

21:01.080 --> 21:03.990
You think I asked to be like this?

21:04.020 --> 21:07.120
I just want to belong and to fit in.

21:07.160 --> 21:10.060
I may look hideous, but I have feelings!

21:11.030 --> 21:13.960
I am not a freak!

21:14.870 --> 21:17.900
I am a human being!

21:23.840 --> 21:25.880
Chyna, that was amazing!

21:25.910 --> 21:29.080
That was the best monologue
I've ever heard.

21:29.110 --> 21:32.110
That was from <i>The Hunchback</i>
<i>of Notre Dame,</i> right?

21:32.600 --> 21:35.500
Uh. Sure.

21:36.560 --> 21:41.270
I mean, I knew you could sing,
but your acting skills, wow!

21:41.280 --> 21:44.850
Not to mention your amazing talent with prosthetic make up.

21:45.460 --> 21:46.930
I don't need to see anybody else.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.750
Chyna's gonna be the lead of the school play.

21:48.750 --> 21:52.030
- What?
- Chyna's gonna be the lead of the school play.

21:56.750 --> 22:00.140
Gibson, Lexi needs a tissue.

22:04.020 --> 22:05.710
Oh, there you are, fletcher.

22:05.740 --> 22:07.290
Mmm!

22:07.320 --> 22:08.510
What do you want?

22:08.550 --> 22:12.330
Well, I still need
activity. Urricular.

22:12.370 --> 22:15.230
Is this
uh, I want to join. Y club?

22:15.260 --> 22:16.450
Sorry, we're full!

22:19.470 --> 22:21.400
But there's only three people here.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.500
I said we're full!

22:24.430 --> 22:25.530
Come on, guys...

22:25.560 --> 22:27.230
Before I eat it all.
