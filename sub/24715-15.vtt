-African gray parrot.

00:05.630 --> 00:07.507
Sergeant Gibson brought it
in this morning.

00:07.590 --> 00:09.300
Alex was shot to death this morning.

00:09.426 --> 00:12.137
His buddy said he was having an affair
with a girl named Janet.

00:12.303 --> 00:13.513
Your husband know you been stepping out?

00:13.847 --> 00:15.974
-We’re separated.
-The ring says different.

00:16.307 --> 00:18.685
Well, I wear this ’cause he sees me
without it, and he goes off.

00:18.893 --> 00:20.186
-What happened?
-He came home drunk

00:20.353 --> 00:21.604
and started yelling at me.

00:21.813 --> 00:23.940
He went and got a bat
and started breaking things up,

00:24.107 --> 00:25.400
And then he came at me.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.027
If he had his gun on him,
he would've shot me.

00:27.193 --> 00:29.362
Stan Hatcher. The borough’s assigned me
to your squad.

00:29.446 --> 00:30.655
-Effective when?
-Today.

00:30.780 --> 00:32.198
Wilmer, you’re so full of crap,

00:32.323 --> 00:34.534
-it’s no wonder your skin is brown.
-(SPEAKING SPANISH)

00:35.577 --> 00:38.079
-Start talking English, asshole!
-All right, all right, enough!

00:38.163 --> 00:40.206
You need to lay back
and see how this squad works.

00:40.498 --> 00:42.459
Fine, I'd like to fit in
with the team here.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.794
So, how about tomorrow
we make a fresh start?

00:45.086 --> 00:47.672
JOHN: Oh, man.
You are going to hell for this.

00:47.797 --> 00:50.216
It’s always been my hope
that guy got a sense of humor.

-Morning, bright eyes. You’re in early.
-Fives.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.991
You’re huggable as a porcupine, Sipowicz,

01:15.075 --> 01:17.869
-but you got an admirable work ethic.
-Thanks, Sarge.

-Permission to board, Colonel.
-Douche bag. (SQUAWKS)

01:24.542 --> 01:27.212

there’s something wrong with your bird.

-COLONEL: Douche bag.
-It’s been saying that

01:29.089 --> 01:30.340
-ever since I got in, loud.
-COLONEL: Douchebag.

-Uh... nothing.

01:39.557 --> 01:40.934
(COLONEL WHISTLING) Douche...

01:41.017 --> 01:44.104
That was nothing. Uh-huh.
Thanks, inspector.

01:45.313 --> 01:48.024
DOA 488 Forsyth. I’ll call the others.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.944
Gibson, we’ve got crime victims
that come in here.

01:51.027 --> 01:53.613
Those assholes on night watch,
Boyce and Debrovsky.

01:53.738 --> 01:55.657
They probably sat in here
all night chanting it.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.659
Crime victims on the worst day
of their life,

01:57.992 --> 01:59.744
giving statements of items stolen
from their home

01:59.869 --> 02:02.372
or descriptions of loved ones
that went missing or worse.

02:02.622 --> 02:05.125
They’ve got to be called Douche bag
by a bird,

02:05.208 --> 02:06.376
you don’t think we’ll get complaints?

02:06.668 --> 02:09.337
You know, the voice of that sounds
an awful lot like you, Sipowicz.

02:09.629 --> 02:12.465

-STAN: Super.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.389
Her boss stopped by
off her missing two days of work.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.850
-He got the super to open the door.
-Where’s her boss?

03:45.975 --> 03:47.477
I got his statement and kicked him.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.020
-You kicked him?
-STAN: Yeah.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.941
-I got his info. I could get him back.
-(SIGHS)

03:53.775 --> 03:56.027
-Where’d she work?
-Saint Luke’s hospital, nightshift,

03:56.361 --> 03:57.654
clerical job.

03:58.154 --> 03:59.948
Boss say she’d been depressed lately?

04:00.114 --> 04:02.158
He said he hadn’t noticed,
but she was never real talkative.

04:02.367 --> 04:03.826
-How long she work there?
-STAN: One year.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.536
-ANDY: She got family?
-STAN: Not in town.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.580
-ANDY: Boyfriend?
-STAN: He didn’t think so.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.040
-Why?
-STAN: She was a loner?

04:09.332 --> 04:11.709
Want me get the boss back?
I got his home, cell, pager,

04:12.126 --> 04:14.545
height, weight, date of birth,
astrological sign.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.590
When it’s my case, I just generally like
to speak face-to-face

04:17.715 --> 04:19.509
-with people involved.
-Sure.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.680
Uh... start a canvass,
see what the neighbors say?

04:26.057 --> 04:27.058
Later.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.939
Did you see this suicide note
on the counter? It’s a long one.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.525
ANDY: What’s your take on this Hatcher?

04:35.608 --> 04:37.527
If he stays out of my way,
I got no beef with him.

04:38.194 --> 04:39.487
(CLEARS THROAT) The note?

04:41.322 --> 04:44.075
It says she was kidnapped
and held for two months last year.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.452
A guy drugged and raped her,
kept her starving and naked.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.037
She didn’t report it to the police
out of shame,

04:48.204 --> 04:50.790
but she got a partial plate
on the perp’s van.

04:53.209 --> 04:55.670
"I never saw him when he abducted me
or when he let me go,

04:55.795 --> 04:58.464
"and I never got a clear look at his face,
when I was in a basement.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.466
"I was fed through a slot In the door,

05:00.675 --> 05:02.802
"and I would always fall asleep
after I ate.

It would be hours later,

That was the DOA'S stepmother
in Waukegan.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.646
She says she uh...
talked to Helen two weeks ago.

05:14.188 --> 05:15.398
She sounded normal.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.817
Stepmom know anything
about the girl being kidnapped?

05:18.526 --> 05:19.694
First she’d heard of it.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.030
What about going missing
two months last year?

05:22.447 --> 05:25.783
The stepmom said that Helen
was pretty sporadic calling home,

05:25.867 --> 05:27.035
so they wouldn’t have noticed.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.995
DOA. have any history of mental illness?

05:29.203 --> 05:32.373
None, but she did have
a nasty Meth problem in high school.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.875
Two stints in rehab.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.879
(SIGHS) Neighbors said the DOA kept
to herself, no visitors.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.340
Landlord said she missed last July
and August's rent.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.300
Out of the blue she reappeared
and paid up.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.093
She didn’t say nothing
about this to anybody?

05:45.595 --> 05:48.014
Got a hit off the partial plate
in the DOA's note.

to a Paul Grady, Queens' address.

-This Grady got a record?
-Nothing.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.233
Making progress. Ten minutes
he hasn’t mentioned the word,

05:59.317 --> 06:00.902
just a matter of negative conditioning.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.488
So, when if he says the word again,

06:03.988 --> 06:05.990
you got to nail him
with a quick "naughty bird."

06:06.157 --> 06:08.785
Yeah, yeah we’re gonna be running around
like lunatics all day,

06:08.868 --> 06:09.911

-Who?

06:12.663 --> 06:13.748
I’ll fill you in, Sarge.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.920

-Just a talking parrot, Ma’am.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.242
Well, a family member stole something
from you?

06:49.659 --> 06:52.912
A diamond ring, it was a gift
from my late husband.

06:53.287 --> 06:55.915
-Who is it you think might have taken it?
-My nephew Tim.

06:56.374 --> 06:59.210
He’s staying at my house
in the spare room.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.254
His mother’s in California,

07:01.379 --> 07:04.924

until he gets work.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.553
I... Is your nephew the only one
with access to the apartment?

07:08.719 --> 07:13.975
No, I have a maid and a... a handyman
came through last week, but it’s Tim.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.018
He’s had his struggles.

07:17.061 --> 07:20.773
-Drugs?
-Mainly, but he insists he’s clean. Uh...

07:22.108 --> 07:24.777
-I don’t know.
-Have you talked to him about the ring?

07:24.986 --> 07:26.112
He denies it.

07:26.571 --> 07:29.365
But... my maid has been
with me for 30 years,

07:29.490 --> 07:31.534
my handyman for 20, so...

07:31.742 --> 07:34.620
-Well, we’ll have a conversation with him.
-What if it wasn’t Tim?

07:34.871 --> 07:37.165
I don’t want to alienate him or my sister.

07:38.124 --> 07:42.462
Um... how about we tell your nephew
that you’re not behind the investigation,

07:42.837 --> 07:45.298
that it’s a mandatory requirement
of the insurance company.

07:45.923 --> 07:48.426
Oh, that would be very kind.

07:50.344 --> 07:53.181
Uh... if you don’t mind,
we need you to make out a report.

07:53.431 --> 07:54.724
Of course.

07:57.768 --> 08:00.396
Sit down. This your first time
in a Police Station, Mr. Grady?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.481
Yeah, you bet.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.733
ANDY: Now, we’ll make it painless
as we can.

08:04.692 --> 08:08.279
You drive a blue Dodge van with...

08:08.988 --> 08:11.491
-this license plate right there?
-Yes.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.743
You the main person driving
or other people, too?

08:13.910 --> 08:17.538
Well, Atilio, who works for me,
he drives it sometimes Marcus, also.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.790
Depends on who’s doing the deliveries
on a given day.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.293
We’re a full-service laundry.
So, why do you ask?

08:22.585 --> 08:24.378
You know a woman named Helen Stoles?

08:25.129 --> 08:27.173
-I don’t think so.
-She says she knows you.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.342
I don’t think I’ve ever heard the name.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.135
I’m gonna show you a photograph,
Mr. Grady.

08:31.469 --> 08:32.887

if you recognize the woman in it?

-Yeah.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.103
And we think there’s a possibility
you had contact with her

08:41.187 --> 08:42.188
when she was alive.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.024
If that’s the case, Mr. Grady,
We need to know now.

08:45.316 --> 08:46.651
Study the picture a little more.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.404
You know...

08:51.739 --> 08:55.576
about six months ago this uh...
this disturbed woman came to our door

08:55.660 --> 08:56.911
around two in the morning.

08:57.036 --> 09:01.082
This filthy, dirty, clothes all torn,
glassy-eyed.

09:01.457 --> 09:04.168
-That might be her.
-She came to your door and did what?

09:04.544 --> 09:07.046
Just asked if she could and sit down
and have some water.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.715
-And you let her?
-I thought she had been attacked.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.301
I was gonna call the police,
but then she started screaming

09:12.385 --> 09:15.179
and calling me all kinds of names,
and then she just ran out the door.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.597
Your wife see this woman?

09:16.931 --> 09:18.724
Absolutely, there was no sleeping
through it.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.476
Did you ever call the police that night?

09:21.269 --> 09:23.729
I just wanted her out
and the door locked behind her.

09:24.313 --> 09:27.191
I guess I should have,
especially if that’s her in the photo.

09:29.318 --> 09:31.028
Would you mind sticking around
for a little bit?

09:31.529 --> 09:33.406
-We need to check a few things out.
-Okay.

09:40.788 --> 09:42.957
Tim Lewis? Detectives Jones and Medavoy.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.500
-Mind if we come in?
-About?

09:44.584 --> 09:47.795
Your aunt’s missing ring.
She’s making an insurance claim.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.089
She needs a police report uh...
with interviews.

09:50.965 --> 09:51.966
Right.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.511
All right... come on in.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.723
You know anything
about how the ring went missing?

09:58.848 --> 10:00.516
Like I told her, I don’t.

10:01.392 --> 10:04.312
You uh... have a criminal record, Tim?

10:04.770 --> 10:07.732
-I’ll bet you know that I do.
-Yeah, possession and sales.

10:08.691 --> 10:11.611
-You been getting high lately?
-Not in nine months.

10:11.902 --> 10:13.779
You willing to take a urine test
to prove it?

10:13.988 --> 10:17.158
Sure, but before you go wading
through my whiz,

10:17.450 --> 10:19.493
did my aunt tell you
about the little trip to mars

10:19.577 --> 10:21.203
she’s been on for the last six months?

10:21.912 --> 10:23.164
What does that mean?

10:23.831 --> 10:26.917
My uncle died, like, five years ago
and since then,

10:27.001 --> 10:29.629
she’s made some pretty dramatic
lifestyle changes,

10:29.920 --> 10:31.964
and as far as the dangers concerned
with those changes,

10:32.048 --> 10:35.551
like getting ripped off...
she’s neck deep in denial.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.137
That’s the personal ad she took out.

10:38.804 --> 10:43.017
"Autumn spirit, sexually liberated,
seeks partners, any age."

10:43.684 --> 10:45.603
From the traffic in
and out of her bedroom,

10:45.728 --> 10:46.854
she’s had a lot of response.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.815
And any guy answering an ad
to bang a broad her age

10:49.982 --> 10:51.484
doesn’t exactly make him high quality.

10:52.234 --> 10:54.945
-You get any names?
-I don’t know if she does.

10:55.446 --> 10:57.990
-Exactly how old is your aunt?
-Late 60s.

of stealing something

-Fifty guys?

11:04.872 --> 11:06.749
Maybe, more than 50.
Honestly, I lost count.

You want to find out
who took the ring, talk to them.

11:45.621 --> 11:46.664
Our DOA I’m talking about.

11:46.997 --> 11:49.041
Yeah, I heard you. Maybe she made it up.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.293
-It’s still pretty elaborate.
-STAN: Thank you.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.461

11:53.129 --> 11:55.131
I got something might be worth
looking into.

11:55.214 --> 11:57.383
A girl named Gina Belle
reported being abducted

11:57.508 --> 11:59.969
off Orange Street in Brooklyn Heights
two years ago.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.763
-Case is still active.
-She got abducted? That it?

12:02.847 --> 12:05.599
Well, she said she was held
for a few weeks, drugged, raped.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.518
-She lives on Clinton.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.264
Can I ask why you’re looking
into my case now?

12:45.723 --> 12:47.892
-So long after it happened?
-We found similar circumstances

12:48.100 --> 12:49.226
in another case.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.770
-Another girl?
-ANDY: It’s possible.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.855
We need to hear what happened
to you to be sure.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.274
Your report said you were abducted
in Brooklyn?

12:55.941 --> 12:58.152
I worked for a printing company.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.697
Walking home,
a car pulled up next to me.

13:01.947 --> 13:06.285
I really didn’t even notice it,
and then there was a wet rag over my face

13:06.535 --> 13:09.163
that smelled sort of sweet.

13:09.538 --> 13:11.290
And I woke up in a dark room.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.417
-Did you see the man who grabbed you?
-No.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.461
JOHN: Do you remember
what kind of car he drove?

13:15.836 --> 13:17.004
I never really saw it.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.048
Can you describe the room
that you were held in?

13:19.131 --> 13:21.342
It was a long time ago, dark...

13:22.426 --> 13:25.679
concrete floor, I just can’t think
of anything else.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.598
When you were picked up by the police,

13:27.681 --> 13:29.725
you told them you were held
for at least two weeks.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.520
Right, but I was a little panicked,
I think.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.773
I... I’m embarrassed to say it,
but I may have exaggerated.

13:35.898 --> 13:38.359
-So, it was more like...
-Two days maybe.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.779
-Were you sexually assaulted?
-I don’t think so, no.

13:42.279 --> 13:44.365
Your rape kit indicated you were.

13:44.573 --> 13:45.991
Well, if it did happen,

13:46.492 --> 13:48.869
It must’ve been when I was asleep,
drugged.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.205
But I don’t remember any kind
of sexual assault.

13:51.413 --> 13:52.957
You remember being picked up
by the police?

13:53.207 --> 13:58.712
I woke up in an alley,
and I just, sort of, got up

13:58.838 --> 14:00.881
and found someone to call a cop.

14:01.048 --> 14:03.384
Police report said
you were found wandering naked,

14:03.592 --> 14:06.762
-disoriented.
-Right. That’s right.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.223
I’m not trying to downplay what happened.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.810
Because it was a scary experience,
but I was pretty young,

14:13.018 --> 14:17.064
and I think I made it
into something it wasn’t.

14:17.273 --> 14:20.484
Still we’d like to show you
a photo array of possible suspects.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.111
I never got much look at the man.

14:22.736 --> 14:24.947
Something might come up.
We’ll be right back.

14:29.577 --> 14:33.706
When Tim said 50 men,
I’m sure he said it spitefully.

14:33.789 --> 14:36.292
But really, it’s not too terribly far off.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.085
Have they all been to your apartment?

14:38.210 --> 14:42.923
Not all. Sometimes I go to theirs,
or we go to a hotel or a motel.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.593
Do you have names and addresses?

14:45.801 --> 14:48.846
Yeah, exactly how much do
You get to know

14:48.929 --> 14:50.973
about these men b... before, uh...

14:51.348 --> 14:55.686
As much as can be gleaned
during a dinner or a lunch or coffee,

14:55.936 --> 14:59.440
and, uh... then there’s sometimes
a look in his eye,

14:59.565 --> 15:00.900
and I know it’s right.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.235
So, I muddle it with a lot of chatter?

15:03.319 --> 15:06.572
Women get to a certain age,
and the culture just gives up on us.

15:07.031 --> 15:10.200
Since no one was knocking
at my door, I threw up a flag,

15:10.284 --> 15:11.827
and it was a good thing I did, too.

15:11.952 --> 15:15.998
It’s afforded me some amazing
sexual experiences with some...

15:16.790 --> 15:18.250
amazing men.

15:18.417 --> 15:21.503
Uh... is there a possibility
one of them took the ring?

15:21.629 --> 15:24.965
Well, if I had thought that,
I would’ve said it when I came in.

15:25.466 --> 15:26.717
I’ve got nothing to hide.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.053
Um... still, and we’re not ruling him out,

15:29.136 --> 15:32.014
but your nephew taking the ring
and him being so available

15:32.097 --> 15:33.641
doesn’t fit the standard profile.

15:34.141 --> 15:35.893
Neither does his willingness
to take a drug test.

15:36.268 --> 15:39.688
I really don’t want to drag anyone
in here unjustly.

-Sure.

A couple months back,
I put in for a transfer

16:25.025 --> 16:26.568

-Yeah, why wouldn’t I be?

16:36.161 --> 16:38.831
You calling early intervention
on Scott got a lot of the cops talking.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.375
And I'm the first one to stand up and say

16:41.458 --> 16:42.751
it was the smartest thing
anyone could have done,

16:42.835 --> 16:46.005
but my being at the 15th
might bring that kind of talk here.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.716
-I got no problem with it.
-You know how cops can be.

16:48.799 --> 16:51.385
Yeah, I do know,
and I got no problem with it.

to the transfer.

See you around the house.

17:05.065 --> 17:09.194
I was in the West Village about 11:00
at night, walking back from dinner.

17:09.570 --> 17:12.614
A man grabbed me from behind,
and I guess he must’ve injected me

17:12.698 --> 17:14.575
with some kind of sedative
’cause I went right out.

17:14.950 --> 17:17.244
-And where’d you wake up?
-In this man’s basement.

17:17.661 --> 17:18.746
It was like a torture chamber.

17:19.496 --> 17:22.124
Like torture instruments?
Could you be specific.

17:23.042 --> 17:27.004
There was a table with restraints on it,
handcuffs chained to the wall.

17:27.629 --> 17:29.423
He’d bring in a bamboo cane

17:29.506 --> 17:32.134
that he’d use to beat the back of my legs.
I was medieval.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.679
Uh... you mentioned being held
almost a month.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.515
-How were you fed?
-Through a slot in the door.

17:39.933 --> 17:45.355
I’d eat, then wake up... very sore,
sexually violated, bruised.

17:45.522 --> 17:48.567
RITA: Was there anyone else involved
or just the one man?

17:48.734 --> 17:51.653
Sometimes I did hear a second voice
through the wall,

17:51.737 --> 17:53.197
but he was the only one I saw.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.948
You saw the man’s face?

17:55.741 --> 17:58.202
Once... for a second.

17:58.702 --> 18:00.746
When I finally figured out
the food was drugged,

18:00.996 --> 18:02.915
I stopped eating, hoping to escape.

18:03.582 --> 18:06.251
He opened the door,
and I saw him in the light.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.170
Then he closed the door right away,

18:08.253 --> 18:10.380
and came back with a mask on
and a Taser gun.

18:10.881 --> 18:14.510
He subdued me and gave me an injection,
and then he raped me.

18:14.885 --> 18:17.888

saying...

All you need is a limp,
drugged-out body to torture.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.105
You’ve got me confused with somebody else.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.398
You were identified, Paul.

19:09.606 --> 19:11.400
You snatched her off the street,
held her for six weeks.

19:11.525 --> 19:14.486
-I'm... I totally baffled by all this.
-We are gonna go to your house,

19:14.611 --> 19:16.363
we’re gonna scour your kidnap van,

19:16.446 --> 19:18.407
we’ll gather mountains
of evidence against you,

19:18.532 --> 19:21.451
-so talk now or be buried by it.
-I’m a dry cleaner.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.537
That’s why I have a van,
not to kidnap people.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.038
You were identified!

19:25.164 --> 19:26.957
That means you are under arrest.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.126
That means you could take your shot
at a trial

19:29.209 --> 19:32.462
or give us an explanation
of why you kidnapped this woman

19:32.629 --> 19:34.423
and raped her and tortured her.

19:34.756 --> 19:37.551
So we can find some way
to present you as a decent human being.

19:37.676 --> 19:40.679
-Then we’ll talk about Helen Stoles...
-I already said, I don’t know her.

19:40.762 --> 19:43.098
...who told the exact same story
as Martha Henstridge.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.976
Kidnapped in your van
and held in your dungeon.

19:46.226 --> 19:49.021
Only Helen told the story
in a suicide note.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.190
Yeah, you drove her to suicide, Paul.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.150
How do you think a judge
is gonna look at that?

19:53.692 --> 19:56.320
That woman in the photo you showed me,
she committed suicide?

19:56.528 --> 20:00.032
We getting through now?
It’s not just rape and kidnapping!

20:00.282 --> 20:01.700
Now you’re looking at a murder.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.327
I’m not saying I did anything,

20:03.410 --> 20:05.829
but how could a suicide
ever be considered murder?

20:05.954 --> 20:09.416
Anytime someone dies as a result
of a crime, it’s felony murder.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.086
I need a minute to think.

20:13.420 --> 20:15.881
Great. We’ll use that time
to search your house.

20:15.964 --> 20:17.591
You don’t have my permission for that.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.843
I think we’ll be able to get a warrant,
let’s go.

-Yes.

20:28.852 --> 20:31.104
-Have you seen her recently?
-JONATHAN: Last week.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.232
-Where?
-Her apartment.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.693
-What’s Veronica saying that I did?
-A piece of her jewelry went missing,

20:36.777 --> 20:39.404
so uh... we’re talking
to some of her acquaintances.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.032
Yeah, specifically the ones
with criminal records.

20:42.199 --> 20:46.411
What I did was not criminal.
I’m an actor, it was a performance piece.

20:46.703 --> 20:48.789
What we got here is indecent exposure.

20:49.831 --> 20:52.834
Maybe you shouldn’t have been performing
so close to a high school.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.796
Either way, I didn’t take any
of Veronica’s jewelry.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.507
Do you support yourself
with your uh... performance?

20:58.715 --> 21:01.635
-I also teach yoga.
-GREG: But a little subsidy wouldn’t hurt.

21:01.843 --> 21:03.929
Like a 15,000 dollar diamond ring.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.597
I didn’t take the ring.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.433
I would never take from someone
who’s given me so much.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.436
What, like a few dollars here
or there for the companionship?

21:11.687 --> 21:14.022
She’s never given me a dime.
What she has given me

21:14.189 --> 21:18.694
are my most spiritual
and uplifting sexual experiences.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.364
-Really?
-Contact yoga.

21:22.906 --> 21:24.116
Full-contact yoga.

21:24.825 --> 21:29.246
Tantric love lust. (INHALES DEEPLY)

21:30.163 --> 21:32.040
It’s not a relationship
I’m looking to burn.

-Are you in debt?
-No.

21:36.336 --> 21:38.672

She did everything that he did.

32:26.819 --> 32:27.987
Oh, my God.

32:29.364 --> 32:30.615
Oh, my God.

32:31.908 --> 32:34.452
(SOBBING)

32:48.591 --> 32:51.636
We got another girl
who’s gonna testify against your husband.

32:51.761 --> 32:52.762
Oh, Lord.

32:52.845 --> 32:55.056
She’s also gonna testify
that you were involved.

32:55.264 --> 32:56.265
Me?

32:56.599 --> 32:58.226
What does that mean? Involved how?

32:58.351 --> 33:00.019
With the torture, the sex.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.313
No, no, no, no.
That’s just not accurate.

33:02.438 --> 33:05.316
She saw your face.
She remembers what you did to her.

33:05.400 --> 33:08.152
Well, the girl is lying
or you put ideas into her head.

33:08.236 --> 33:10.488
-Right.
-I was beaten the same as those girls.

33:10.780 --> 33:14.701
I was raped. I feared for my life.
Why am I being treated like a criminal?

33:14.826 --> 33:18.121
Testify against your husband.
It could get time off your sentence.

33:18.204 --> 33:20.373
But you playing victim ain’t gonna work.

33:29.382 --> 33:31.050
Paul brought home girls.

33:31.592 --> 33:32.969
They’d been drugged.

33:33.928 --> 33:35.388
He put them in the basement,

33:35.513 --> 33:37.682
then he’d go down there
and come up hours later,

33:37.849 --> 33:40.560
-sometimes covered in blood.
-Okay.

33:40.810 --> 33:43.438
When I asked him what he was doing,
he said he was a deprogrammer.

33:43.521 --> 33:44.731
No, no, no. We’re way past this.

33:44.897 --> 33:48.109
And when I said I didn’t believe him,
he beat me and threatened my life.

33:48.192 --> 33:49.819
ANDY: Get to how you participated
in the torture.

33:49.902 --> 33:51.070
Never. I never did.

33:51.279 --> 33:55.116
Do you understand? We have a girl
who saw you a girl with no reason to lie!

33:55.241 --> 33:57.785
Well, she is lying because
I was never down there!

33:58.036 --> 34:01.080
I will tell you who the girls were
that my husband kidnapped,

34:01.289 --> 34:04.000
and how long he kept them,
but I will never tell you

34:04.083 --> 34:06.294
that I had anything to do
with what happened in the basement.

34:07.336 --> 34:10.923
Now, I am sick with guilt
that I didn’t do more to help those girls,

34:11.007 --> 34:12.550
but I was scared for my life.

34:13.718 --> 34:15.219
And that’s all I’m gonna say.

34:21.100 --> 34:24.395
(GASPS) Oh, thank god.

34:24.687 --> 34:26.814
-Just as you remember it?
-Exactly.

34:29.484 --> 34:31.277
(LAUGHS) I'm sure it is.

34:31.486 --> 34:33.946
And as far as charges against your nephew,

34:34.072 --> 34:37.366
if you still have a mind
not to file and opt for rehab,

34:37.742 --> 34:39.077
there’s some recommendations I could make.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.203
I spoke to his mother,

34:40.286 --> 34:42.872
and she has a center set
for him in California.

34:42.955 --> 34:44.248
There you go. That’s for the best.

34:44.457 --> 34:45.541
I think so, too.

34:46.542 --> 34:47.543
(SIGHS) Well.

34:48.169 --> 34:50.171
I can’t thank you enough.

34:50.463 --> 34:51.464
(CHUCKLES)

34:52.048 --> 34:54.967
You’ve handled this matter
with such grace,

34:55.218 --> 34:57.512
you and detective Jones.

34:58.721 --> 35:01.599
-Uh... please tell him I said thank you.
-I will, absolutely.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.769
Well, is there anything else
you need me for?

35:04.936 --> 35:06.312
Papers to sign?

35:06.979 --> 35:08.689
Anything you’d like to talk about?

35:09.649 --> 35:12.110
Well, if something comes to mind,
you have my number.

35:15.363 --> 35:17.657
You really do have a sweetness, detective.

35:17.824 --> 35:20.827
I could tell that the first second
I saw you.

35:22.245 --> 35:23.246
Hmm.

35:29.919 --> 35:32.463
Gina Belle saw a photo array
with Susan Grady in it?

35:32.713 --> 35:33.965
But she couldn’t ID.

35:34.173 --> 35:35.800
It’s got to be worth something
that she identified

35:35.883 --> 35:37.301
there was a female present.

35:37.426 --> 35:39.053
-Could've been anyone.
-There’s only one woman

35:39.262 --> 35:41.180
-it could have been.
-VALERIE: You know it. I know it.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.265
but without a clear I.D.,

35:42.390 --> 35:44.559
and with Susan Grady playing up
the battered wife...

35:44.851 --> 35:47.228
She’ll make an immunity deal
for testimony against her husband.

35:47.770 --> 35:50.106
He’ll go away forever.
You can take comfort in that.

35:50.314 --> 35:51.941
-Yeah.
-I’ll be in touch.

35:53.651 --> 35:54.819
If the husband hadn’t lawyered up,

35:54.902 --> 35:56.154
we might have gotten him
to turn on the wife.

35:56.487 --> 35:57.655
And played them off each other,

35:57.989 --> 35:59.240
maybe found out why the hell
all this happened

35:59.323 --> 36:02.034
in the first place which now
we never will.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.459
I’m gonna get Grady to central booking.

I was mad about it a long time.
I’m still mad about it.

But I learned it’s got to have its place.

to Marcy get into the work,

who taught him that word,

to ask is...
