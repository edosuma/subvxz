00:08.700 --> 00:11.670
All right, it's time for our
weekly team Austin meeting.

00:11.710 --> 00:14.350
Trish is late as usual,

00:14.390 --> 00:15.950
So I'll just call the
meeting to order.

00:20.670 --> 00:22.740
Man, I love gaveling.

00:24.440 --> 00:27.380
Guess who got a job
at it's a racquet?

00:27.410 --> 00:29.350
The tennis store?

00:29.380 --> 00:31.320
Why would they hire you?
You stink at tennis.

00:31.350 --> 00:34.290
You're right. But I
don't stink at this.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.560
Hey, don't do that to my friend.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.300
Without doing it to me too!

00:47.400 --> 00:49.540
Guys, come on, turn that off.

00:51.340 --> 00:52.710
Ally.

00:54.450 --> 00:56.280
Oh sorry. All right,

00:56.320 --> 00:57.520
First order.

00:57.550 --> 00:59.390
Progress report.

00:59.420 --> 01:00.636
I just finished a
great new song.

01:00.660 --> 01:02.183
- Austin. - I came up with

01:02.195 --> 01:03.730
some sweet new dance moves.

01:09.730 --> 01:12.600
Love it. Dez, what's up
with our next video?

01:12.640 --> 01:14.540
I don't want to
give too much away,

01:14.570 --> 01:16.510
But I'm going to
need a helicopter,

01:16.540 --> 01:18.670
A giraffe and a red pen.

01:18.710 --> 01:21.480
No, no and here.

01:22.710 --> 01:24.650
Trish, manager report...
whatcha got?

01:24.680 --> 01:27.520
Well, you know,

01:27.550 --> 01:29.580
I've got some music
stuff in the works,

01:29.620 --> 01:31.590
Some video stuff.

01:31.620 --> 01:35.460
And a bunch of other stuff too.

01:35.490 --> 01:38.700
Wow, that's a lot of stuff.

01:38.730 --> 01:41.400
What about the Miami
jam-a-thon next weekend?

01:41.430 --> 01:44.400
- Have you booked me yet?
- I'm working on it, I swear.

01:44.440 --> 01:47.740
Okay, great. Now time to
read Austin's fan emails.

01:47.770 --> 01:51.640
"turn the tennis ball
launcher back on"?

01:51.680 --> 01:53.680
Dez, did you write this?

01:53.710 --> 01:55.680
No.

01:58.590 --> 02:00.620
Austin moon, just the
man I'm looking for.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.530
I saw your last Webcast online.

02:04.560 --> 02:06.630
And I think you're
going to be a star.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.530
Awesome!

02:08.570 --> 02:10.470
Who are you?

02:10.500 --> 02:12.340
Demonica Dixon.

02:16.740 --> 02:19.280
Rihanna? Great.

02:19.310 --> 02:21.480
Make that eight.

02:21.510 --> 02:23.480
How'd you like to be nine?

02:23.510 --> 02:24.650
I kind of like being 15

02:24.680 --> 02:27.280
'cause when I was nine
I had chicken pox.

02:28.390 --> 02:30.490
I mean I want to represent you.

02:30.520 --> 02:33.390
Whoa whoa. I am
Austin's manager.

02:33.420 --> 02:34.660
Slow your roll, lady.

02:34.690 --> 02:38.530
Yeah, please obey the speed
limit on your roll, lady.

02:40.460 --> 02:42.470
Miss Dixon.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.670
We're happy with
our friend Trish.

02:44.700 --> 02:46.500
Oh how sweet,

02:46.540 --> 02:49.370
You're represented
by your friend.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.310
But it's called "show business,"

02:52.340 --> 02:55.580
Not "show friendness."
ooh, write that down.

02:56.580 --> 02:58.620
Is "friendness" two words?

02:58.650 --> 02:59.720
Not you, Dez.

03:01.790 --> 03:04.720
The point is, if I'm
Austin's manager,

03:04.760 --> 03:07.260
He'll be one of the
biggest stars on earth.

03:07.290 --> 03:08.290
Visual aid.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.630
Wow, that would
make me so happy.

03:13.660 --> 03:14.700
Visual aid.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.700
Austin, ignore her.
She's clearly all talk.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.340
If she was any kind
of real manager,

03:21.370 --> 03:24.380
She'd be wooing you over
a fancy gourmet lunch.

03:24.410 --> 03:26.440
Oh, you mean like this? Lunch!

03:29.620 --> 03:31.650
What, no music?

03:31.680 --> 03:33.580
Music!

Hate to break it
to you, demonica,

04:36.720 --> 04:38.690
But you can't be
having lunch here.

04:38.720 --> 04:41.690
Ally has a strict
no-eating-in-the-store rule.

04:41.720 --> 04:44.730
- Right, Ally?
- Hmm?

04:48.300 --> 04:51.570
Thanks, demonica. I've ever had.
St meal.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.500
Mine's a little tough.

04:53.540 --> 04:56.510
You're supposed to take the
meat out of the Shell.

04:56.540 --> 04:59.340
Oh.

04:59.380 --> 05:01.610
Mmm. Much better.

05:02.780 --> 05:05.550
So, Austin, what do you say?

05:05.580 --> 05:08.390
Ready to sign with
team demonica?

05:08.420 --> 05:10.290
I have team Austin.

05:10.320 --> 05:14.490
Ally writes the songs, Dez directs
the videos and Trish manages us.

05:14.530 --> 05:17.260
Yeah, nice try,

05:17.300 --> 05:19.430
But it takes a lot more
than a fancy lunch.

05:19.460 --> 05:22.700
And some background music
to impress Austin.

05:22.730 --> 05:26.400
Check it out! They turned
my leftovers into a swan!

05:27.670 --> 05:30.410
Austin, let me make
this easier for you.

05:30.440 --> 05:32.680
What's your wildest dream?

05:32.710 --> 05:35.580
That's easy. I'm being chased
through a candy cane forest.

05:35.610 --> 05:38.350
By a viking, my grandma
and a peanut vendor.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.320
They're throwing
cantaloupes at me.

05:40.350 --> 05:42.320
Then it gets weird.

05:43.490 --> 05:46.620
Career. I think she meant
your wildest career dream.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.260
Oh.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.300
Well, ever since I was a
kid, I've always wanted.

05:52.330 --> 05:54.560
To perform in Times
Square on new year's eve.

05:54.600 --> 05:57.700
If you perform there, it means
you've totally made it.

05:57.730 --> 06:01.470
And if you let me manage
you, I can make that happen.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.510
You really think you
can buy Austin.

06:03.540 --> 06:06.410
With a crazy promise
and some lobster?

06:06.440 --> 06:09.240
Can you believe this lady, Ally?

06:09.280 --> 06:12.210
Hmm?

06:12.250 --> 06:15.450
Think about it, Austin.
I can change your life.

06:15.490 --> 06:17.350
Dramatic exit!

06:23.390 --> 06:25.300
There's something wrong
with this cupcake.

06:25.330 --> 06:27.300
You have to take the paper off.

06:27.330 --> 06:28.730
Oh.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.510

Another great song, Ally.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.320
Thanks. I can't wait
to hear you sing it.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.320
When Trish books you
at the jam-a-thon.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.560
If Trish books me
at the jam-a-thon.

06:55.700 --> 06:58.660
What? Demonica would have
snapped her fingers.

06:58.700 --> 07:02.300
And I'd be jammin' all
over that 'thon right now.

07:02.340 --> 07:05.570
Don't tell me you're even
considering changing managers.

07:05.610 --> 07:08.340
I don't know.

07:11.580 --> 07:13.480
Hey guys.

07:13.510 --> 07:15.350
I've been thinking
about demonica Dixon,

07:15.380 --> 07:18.480
That finger-snapping,
bluetooth-wearing, puppy-hating thief!

07:18.520 --> 07:21.320
How do you know she
hates puppies?

07:21.350 --> 07:23.390
I don't. I just
needed a third thing.

07:23.420 --> 07:26.260
Anyway, she made me realize

07:26.290 --> 07:28.360
I needed to step up
my game, so I did.

07:28.390 --> 07:30.400
I booked you at the
Miami jam-a-thon.

07:30.430 --> 07:33.530
That's awesome! I
never doubted you.

07:35.600 --> 07:39.370
And to celebrate, we're going to have a
fancy lunch with some background music.

07:43.710 --> 07:46.380
- Thanks, Trish.
- No, not him.

07:46.410 --> 07:47.710
<i>That's</i> my guy.

07:48.750 --> 07:50.520

Hi, we're here to check
in for the jam-a-thon.

08:08.270 --> 08:10.310
My client Austin
moon is performing.

08:10.340 --> 08:12.270
He was supposed to
perform at 1:00.

08:12.310 --> 08:13.710
It's 4:00 now.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.480
What? There must be a mistake.

08:17.510 --> 08:19.250
Can he still sing anyway?

08:19.280 --> 08:21.620
Of course. Just not here.

08:23.250 --> 08:25.620
Try the bathroom. It's
got lovely acoustics.

08:28.260 --> 08:29.690
I can't believe this.

08:29.730 --> 08:32.429
Trish, you said I was
supposed to perform at 4:00.

08:32.460 --> 08:35.630
Because you were. And I can prove
it because I wrote it on a napkin.

08:37.570 --> 08:39.500
No, that's my
homework assignment.

08:39.539 --> 08:41.270
I must have written
it somewhere else.

08:41.299 --> 08:42.600
What's that on your hand?

08:42.640 --> 08:44.610
That's my work schedule.
I don't need that.

08:45.710 --> 08:47.680
You wrote something
on my back today.

08:51.650 --> 08:54.380
- That just says you're a bozo.
- Oh.

08:55.620 --> 08:59.720
Well, if it isn't team Austin.

08:59.750 --> 09:03.460
I thought you were supposed
to go on three hours ago.

09:03.490 --> 09:06.430
Trish mixed up the
times, so we were late.

09:06.460 --> 09:10.230
- Now I can't perform.
- I didn't mix anything up.

09:10.270 --> 09:12.430
These things wouldn't happen
if I were your manager.

09:12.470 --> 09:15.540
Maybe you take being his manager
a little too lightly, Trish.

09:15.570 --> 09:18.310
That's ridiculous.
Right, Austin?

09:18.340 --> 09:21.540
Well, sometimes you are a little
late to our team Austin meetings.

09:21.580 --> 09:23.350
That's not true.

09:23.380 --> 09:25.596
I showed up 30 minutes early
for our meeting on Wednesday.

09:25.620 --> 09:28.520
The meeting was Tuesday.

09:28.550 --> 09:30.450
Ally, back me up here.

09:30.490 --> 09:32.590
Trish just has her own style.

09:32.620 --> 09:35.620
She is not that disorganized.

09:35.660 --> 09:37.430
What is that on your elbow?

09:37.460 --> 09:41.700
Oh, that's just
Trish's grocery list.

09:41.730 --> 09:45.370
Apparently she needs
milk, eggs and paper.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.640
Austin, don't you think it's
time you sign with someone.

09:47.670 --> 09:50.270
Who will take your
career more seriously?

09:51.740 --> 09:54.710
- I guess.
- Great. Let's shake on it.

09:54.750 --> 09:57.380
Shake!

10:00.520 --> 10:01.750
Oh!

10:04.360 --> 10:05.590
Do you think she's really mad?

10:17.760 --> 10:19.600
Hey, Ally.

10:19.630 --> 10:21.930
What's wrong? You're
cleaning like a maniac.

10:21.970 --> 10:24.570
No, I'm not.

10:30.840 --> 10:33.680
I just can't stop thinking
about firing Trish.

10:33.710 --> 10:35.580
I clean when I'm upset.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.750
- Trish!
- Ally.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.620
So you're still mad at us.

10:41.650 --> 10:44.950
Why would I be mad? Just
because my best friend.

10:44.990 --> 10:46.960
Stabbed me in the back.

10:46.990 --> 10:49.690
And fired me from the
only job I ever liked?

10:49.730 --> 10:51.860
See, Ally? She's fine.

10:53.900 --> 10:55.770
Yeah, my life's great.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.630
I got a new job at
meatballas restaurant.

10:57.670 --> 10:59.940
"we got game and unlimited
breadsticks, fool!"

11:02.910 --> 11:04.810
And I'm managing a new client.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.740
- Who?
- Him.

11:09.510 --> 11:11.950
That's a person? I
just polished him.

11:13.720 --> 11:17.490
Statue guy's the next big thing
in stationary performance.

11:17.520 --> 11:18.850
Now if you'll excuse me,

11:18.890 --> 11:21.490
I've got some big managing
stuff in the works.

11:22.830 --> 11:24.590
C'mon, statue guy.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.760
Told you he was good.

11:30.770 --> 11:32.470
Client stealer.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.700
I'd insult you back,

11:33.740 --> 11:35.640
But you have meatballs
on your head.

11:35.670 --> 11:37.770
Do I need to?

11:38.910 --> 11:40.610
Great, we're all here.

11:40.640 --> 11:42.810
- Now we can start the team Austin meeting.
- Chair!

11:47.520 --> 11:49.550
She thinks that guy's a chair.

11:50.890 --> 11:52.650
I still feel bad about Trish,

11:52.690 --> 11:55.960
But at least there's one thing
that always makes me happy.

11:55.990 --> 11:57.890
Sweetie, let me handle that.

11:57.930 --> 11:59.630
Gavel!

12:02.730 --> 12:04.900
Man, I love gaveling.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.530
Gaveling's <i>my</i> thing.

12:08.570 --> 12:11.700
Progress report. Ally?

12:11.730 --> 12:13.570
Ooh, I have a great new song.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.670
Fantastic. I'll
listen to that later.

12:15.710 --> 12:17.810
Dez?

12:17.840 --> 12:19.840
I've got a cool video idea.

12:19.880 --> 12:22.910
It's inspired by my
favorite Spike Stevens.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.880
He's the best video
director in the business.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.450
That gives me a great idea.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.880
Spike? Demonica.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.750
How'd you like to direct.

12:31.790 --> 12:34.590
My new client Austin
moon's next video?

12:34.620 --> 12:36.560
Fantastic.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.790
You just got the
best video director.

12:38.830 --> 12:41.530
In the business. You're welcome.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.560
Cool exit!

12:49.770 --> 12:51.540
No way!

12:51.570 --> 12:53.710
Spike Stevens is gonna
direct my next video!

12:53.740 --> 12:55.740
That's so awesome! Happy dance!

12:55.780 --> 12:57.740
Happy dance! Happy dance!

12:57.780 --> 12:59.580
Happy dance!

12:59.610 --> 13:01.610
Wait a minute.

13:01.650 --> 13:03.750
I think you just talked
yourself out of the job.

13:03.780 --> 13:05.880
Aw, sad dance.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.430
You're really upset, huh?

13:19.460 --> 13:21.600
Is it that obvious?

13:21.630 --> 13:24.800
Well, you frowny-faced
all your pancakes.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.770
I'm really bummed about Dez.

13:28.810 --> 13:30.810
Dez is easygoing.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.840
I'm sure he's gotten
over it by now.

13:34.810 --> 13:36.950
I'll never get over this.

13:38.650 --> 13:40.950
See? He's fine.

13:42.620 --> 13:43.920
You guys want to eat with us?

13:43.950 --> 13:46.690
Can't. We're having lunch
with my new client.

13:50.960 --> 13:55.860
Dez, thanks again for suggesting
spike Stevens. Brilliant.

14:00.600 --> 14:03.470
I listened to your song.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.700
Awesome! I didn't like it.

14:05.740 --> 14:07.510
Not awesome.

14:07.540 --> 14:09.540
So here's what I did.

14:09.580 --> 14:11.880
I hired a team of
experienced songwriters.

14:11.910 --> 14:14.880
And we're going to take
Austin to the next level.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.880
But Ally's my partner.

14:17.920 --> 14:21.450
Look, I want you singing
a professional song.

14:21.490 --> 14:23.450
In front of the whole world.

14:23.490 --> 14:26.690
When you play Times
Square on new year's eve.

14:26.730 --> 14:27.860
Visual aid!

14:30.700 --> 14:33.600
What?! I'm playing
Times Square?!

14:33.630 --> 14:36.500
You hired me to make your
dream come true and I did.

14:36.530 --> 14:38.740
We're announcing it at a big
press conference tomorrow.

14:38.770 --> 14:40.740
Triumphant exit.

14:47.580 --> 14:48.810
Congratulations.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.680
Ally, I'm so sorry.

14:51.710 --> 14:53.680
It's okay, I get it.

14:53.720 --> 14:55.820
Playing Times Square
is your dream.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.690
Looks like I'm one of you now.

15:07.720 --> 15:09.430
Are you gonna eat that?

15:20.310 --> 15:23.650
I can't believe I just played
Times Square on new year's eve!

15:23.680 --> 15:27.490
And the best part is I got to live out
my dream with my three best friends.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.660
Thank you, Austin.

15:31.690 --> 15:34.590
I didn't know you felt
that way about us.

15:34.630 --> 15:37.300
Ah! This must be a nightmare!

15:41.600 --> 15:46.310
No-o-o-o!

15:49.310 --> 15:52.280
Oh cool. Peanuts.

15:55.620 --> 15:58.450
No-o-o-o-o!

16:05.630 --> 16:09.530
- What are you doing?
- Directing statue guy's first video.

16:09.560 --> 16:12.570
Okay, you're standing there.
Keep standing, keep standing.

16:12.600 --> 16:16.370
You're still standing.
Still standing.

16:17.540 --> 16:20.640
This is gonna be the
most boring video ever.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.550
You're not going to believe
what I found in the trash...

16:23.580 --> 16:26.210
The mp3 player I gave demonica.

16:26.250 --> 16:28.420
She never even
listened to my song!

16:28.450 --> 16:32.250
I'm starting to think she's
kind of a bad person.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.390
Guys, I've been made a fool of!

16:36.430 --> 16:39.330
It's okay, we've gotten
used to the meatball hat.

16:40.630 --> 16:42.630
No, I'm talking about demonica!

16:42.670 --> 16:45.300
She was behind the
jam-a-thon mix-up.

16:45.330 --> 16:47.500
She had her assistant
pose as me on the phone.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.270
Show her.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.470
Hello?

16:51.510 --> 16:53.480
Miami jam-a-thon promoter?
This is Trish.

16:53.510 --> 16:55.640
I'd like to change
Austin moon's set time.

16:55.680 --> 16:56.680
See?

17:00.320 --> 17:02.320
That doesn't sound
anything like you.

17:03.320 --> 17:06.220
Guys, I made a huge mistake!

17:06.260 --> 17:07.636
I shouldn't have let
demonica fire you.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.329
What happened? What made
you change your mind?

17:10.359 --> 17:11.630
I had the worst nightmare.

17:11.660 --> 17:14.500
I was playing new year's
eve without you guys.

17:14.530 --> 17:16.530
And I was out of peanuts.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.400
But mostly the new
year's eve thing.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.339
Well, I'm glad you're back.

17:23.369 --> 17:25.616
You're never gonna believe what
we found out about demonica.

17:25.640 --> 17:28.610
She threw away my song without
even listening to it.

17:28.640 --> 17:32.250
And she sabotaged your jam-a-thon
gig to make me look bad.

17:32.280 --> 17:34.350
And she broke the
keyboard on the wall,

17:34.380 --> 17:37.550
And put it back up there to make it
look like nothing happened to it.

17:40.290 --> 17:41.720
Dez?

17:43.390 --> 17:46.460
Fine, I broke it!

17:46.490 --> 17:49.530
But she's still a
very bad person.

17:49.560 --> 17:53.540
Well, I have a way to show demonica
that I don't need her anymore.

17:53.570 --> 17:55.400
And I have a way
to show demonica.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.570
That she messed with
the wrong people.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.680
Team Austin is back.

17:59.710 --> 18:03.480
Yeah, I don't want to be
famous without my friends.

18:03.510 --> 18:05.580
Thanks, Austin. We missed you.

18:08.390 --> 18:10.320
Welcome back, buddy.

18:12.460 --> 18:14.520
I guess we're hugging.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.530
And hug over.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.700
Thank you for coming.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.640
From the moment I laid
eyes on Austin moon

18:32.680 --> 18:35.510
I knew that, with my guidance,

18:35.550 --> 18:38.550
He would become a superstar.

18:38.580 --> 18:42.350
Together we are going to kick butt.
Visual aid!

18:47.490 --> 18:50.560
Now to say a few words,
my newest client,

18:50.600 --> 18:52.400
Austin moon.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.700
It's always been my dream
to perform in Times Square,

18:58.740 --> 19:01.640
But I've realized that if
you're living your dream.

19:01.670 --> 19:05.410
Without your friends, it's
more like a nightmare.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.450
What are you talking about?

19:07.480 --> 19:10.580
I have team Austin and this is
what we can do without <i>you.</i>

That song was written
by my partner Ally,

20:35.570 --> 20:38.300
<i>The video was shot by
my best friend Dez</i>

20:38.340 --> 20:41.640
And the whole thing was put
together by my manager Trish.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.580
- Come on up here, guys.
- I'm good right here.

20:49.780 --> 20:53.690
Your <i>manager</i> Trish?
I'm your manager.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.650
Not anymore. You're fired.

20:55.690 --> 20:58.320
In your face, finger-snapper!

20:58.360 --> 21:01.360
You're going to
regret letting me go.

21:01.390 --> 21:04.330
And you're gonna regret
wearing a nice outfit.

21:04.360 --> 21:07.500
- Why?
- Sweet sweet revenge.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.500
Meatballs.

21:14.440 --> 21:18.340
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

21:33.430 --> 21:34.690
Blah!

21:47.780 --> 21:50.410
Boo!

21:50.440 --> 21:52.480
Man, you're good.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.550
Sorry I was late.

21:56.580 --> 21:59.420
I was doing it won't
ever happen again.

21:59.450 --> 22:01.420
Oh, I've heard that before.

22:01.460 --> 22:04.290
Trish, you're fired.

22:04.330 --> 22:08.300
Come on kids, let's go.
