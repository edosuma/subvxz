01:04.472 --> 01:05.670
Hey.

01:05.706 --> 01:07.372
Who's that?

01:08.534 --> 01:09.869
You can trust him.

01:12.876 --> 01:14.849
The uh,

01:14.884 --> 01:15.705
the place is under
construction,

01:15.741 --> 01:18.284
so don't worry about any alarms.

01:19.978 --> 01:22.754
If I hear anything go out
on the radio,

01:22.790 --> 01:25.086
I'll head it off.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.977
I got a bad feeling about this,
man.

02:26.955 --> 02:28.689
Didn't Frank pass in this job?

02:28.724 --> 02:30.422
I need the money, Kevin.

02:32.759 --> 02:33.659
We're in.

02:33.694 --> 02:35.486
Let's go.

03:38.483 --> 03:40.294
Jackpot!

03:41.830 --> 03:43.726
That's what we came for.

03:52.071 --> 03:53.868
What the fuck is that?

03:58.143 --> 04:00.707
It's a motion sensor.

04:06.448 --> 04:07.484
What do we do now?

04:07.520 --> 04:09.416
If a call went out,
I'm sure Zwick got it.

04:09.451 --> 04:10.249
I can't get caught, man.

04:10.284 --> 04:11.150
April...

04:11.185 --> 04:12.256
I'm all she got.
What-- what do we do?

04:12.291 --> 04:14.125
Kev--
Kev, it's gonna be okay.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.554
Your sister's gonna be fine.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.757
But let's get a move on.

04:16.792 --> 04:18.863
Pack up that stuff
and take it to the van.

04:18.899 --> 04:19.957
I got this.

04:19.993 --> 04:22.428
Dispatch, this is DC 11,
I'm in the area.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.864
I'll swing by.

05:16.649 --> 05:17.655
This one's dead.

05:20.995 --> 05:22.455
What the fuck, man?

05:22.490 --> 05:23.427
You shot him!

05:23.462 --> 05:24.897
Put your hands up
on your head!

05:24.933 --> 05:25.930
You piece of shit!

05:25.965 --> 05:27.632
Do it now!

05:32.105 --> 05:33.836
Come on, turn around.

05:35.909 --> 05:36.971
Let's go.

05:38.610 --> 05:41.112
Now, listen to me
very carefully, Miller.

05:41.147 --> 05:43.917
Your friend had a gun.

05:43.952 --> 05:46.018
He shot twice at me.

05:46.053 --> 05:48.647
And I defended myself.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.580
Do I have that right?

05:49.615 --> 05:50.349
Fuck you!

05:51.983 --> 05:54.686
Think of Beth and the baby.

05:58.029 --> 06:00.294
Okay.

06:00.329 --> 06:01.798
Let's go.

06:08.737 --> 06:10.642
PRISON OFFICER 1:
Open two!

07:53.147 --> 07:54.680
Welcome to the world.

07:59.311 --> 08:03.188
We gonna get you back
on your feet.

08:03.223 --> 08:05.290
I need a locksmith.

08:05.326 --> 08:08.160
Figured I could get you set up.

08:08.195 --> 08:10.458
Except I'm a felon.

08:10.494 --> 08:11.459
They took my cert.

08:11.494 --> 08:12.296
You know that.

08:12.331 --> 08:13.130
Oh, we'll put you down

08:13.166 --> 08:15.828
as handyman on the books
for your PO.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.102
Just until you get sorted.

08:17.138 --> 08:19.133
Whatever it takes.

08:21.105 --> 08:23.467
I just want to make things
right with Beth and Lindsay.

08:24.911 --> 08:27.680
Did you ever tell them what
really went down that night?

08:37.890 --> 08:41.661
FRANK:
Say hello
to your new accommodations.

08:43.962 --> 08:46.858
There's a shower next
to the shitter in the back.

08:46.893 --> 08:48.058
Man, you have no idea

08:48.093 --> 08:49.133
how happy I am to hear that.

08:52.934 --> 08:55.041
I think you two have met before.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.370
You kidding me?

08:56.405 --> 08:57.041
Yeah.

08:57.076 --> 08:58.207
What?

08:59.243 --> 09:01.171
I thought this thing would be
a bunch of spare parts by now.

09:01.206 --> 09:03.309
Man, I kept it running
for you.

09:03.344 --> 09:06.153
Kept it just the way
you like it, dents and all.

09:06.188 --> 09:08.017
Even added a few new ones.

09:09.223 --> 09:10.888
Thank you, Frank.

09:12.225 --> 09:14.056
Something else.

09:14.756 --> 09:16.756
This is my old phone.

09:16.791 --> 09:18.495
I got you a cheap plan.

09:18.531 --> 09:22.169
You pay the first every month.

09:22.204 --> 09:25.496
And uh, here's an advance.

09:32.213 --> 09:34.846
Lock up after you leave.

09:36.318 --> 09:39.976
Hey Frank, what's up with April?

09:40.012 --> 09:41.213
As far as I know,

09:41.248 --> 09:44.347
she stayed
in that foster care situation.

09:44.383 --> 09:46.620
I took my stab at being
mentor material

09:46.656 --> 09:48.360
to you and Kevin.

09:48.395 --> 09:51.256
You see how that worked out.

09:51.292 --> 09:55.360
Uh, after the trial,
I reached out to her.

09:55.396 --> 09:58.705
She didn't seem interested
in staying in touch.

10:00.469 --> 10:02.038
Alright.

10:02.937 --> 10:05.208
Don't burn down the place.

10:05.243 --> 10:06.937
I won't.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.161
<i>BETH :</i>
<i>This is Fisher.</i>

10:57.196 --> 10:58.431
Hi Beth.

10:58.466 --> 11:00.232
<i>BETH :</i>
<i>Miller?</i>

11:00.267 --> 11:03.135
I just got out.

11:03.171 --> 11:04.368
Can we meet?

11:04.404 --> 11:07.004
Can I see Lindsay?

11:30.163 --> 11:31.330
Hi.

11:31.365 --> 11:32.331
ROSIE:
Hi Lindsay.

11:32.366 --> 11:33.331
You're sticking to me.

11:34.234 --> 11:35.826
Say hello.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.500
Hi.

11:37.535 --> 11:38.303
Let's sit down.

11:38.338 --> 11:39.740
Yeah, thanks.

11:41.374 --> 11:42.407
Oh my gosh!

11:42.442 --> 11:43.935
Lindsay, you're so big.

11:45.339 --> 11:47.838
What are you in like,
fifth grade now?

11:47.873 --> 11:48.479
Sixth.

11:48.514 --> 11:50.311
MILLER:
Ah, sixth.

11:55.052 --> 11:57.313
Hey Linds,
why don't you go over to Rosie,

11:57.349 --> 11:59.685
and grab us a few slices of pie.

11:59.720 --> 12:00.293
Yeah?

12:00.328 --> 12:01.820
Any flavor you want.

12:01.855 --> 12:02.387
I'll pick.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.194
You pick, you choose.

12:03.229 --> 12:03.695
Okay.

12:12.934 --> 12:15.006
You look great, Beth.

12:18.211 --> 12:18.836
Miller.

12:18.871 --> 12:19.740
What?

12:19.775 --> 12:20.939
What is this?

12:20.975 --> 12:23.040
What do you mean?

12:23.075 --> 12:25.216
This is lunch.

12:25.251 --> 12:26.111
Right.

12:26.147 --> 12:28.047
Two slices of lemon meringue.

12:28.082 --> 12:29.790
And what does your dad like?

12:31.490 --> 12:33.420
I'm not sure.

12:37.965 --> 12:40.292
And what are we doing meeting
here of all places?

12:40.328 --> 12:42.569
Oh, we used to come here
all the time.

12:42.604 --> 12:44.697
So,
I just had good memories here.

12:44.732 --> 12:46.104
Right.

12:46.139 --> 12:49.401
Something about those nights
sitting up at that counter.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.707
Waiting for you to finish
your shift.

12:50.742 --> 12:52.109
And I remember coming back

12:52.144 --> 12:55.310
and having to work doubles
after you went inside.

13:00.584 --> 13:02.378
I'm sorry.

13:02.414 --> 13:07.556
Miller, I'm here for Lindsay.

13:07.592 --> 13:09.258
You know...

13:13.966 --> 13:18.328
I came to see if I can
let our daughter

13:18.364 --> 13:20.240
have a relationship with you.

13:20.275 --> 13:22.574
I'm her father.

13:22.609 --> 13:25.307
Not for the last 10 years.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.853
This is no excuse
but 10 years ago,

13:33.888 --> 13:37.984
I was afraid I couldn't provide
for you guys.

13:38.019 --> 13:39.483
And so I fucked up.

13:39.519 --> 13:44.029
I made a really, really
bad decision.

13:45.433 --> 13:48.200
A really bad decision.

13:48.235 --> 13:50.134
Jesus.

13:51.867 --> 13:54.666
Kevin died.

14:03.316 --> 14:03.910
Look.

14:05.853 --> 14:08.452
I want you to spend time
with her, okay?

14:08.488 --> 14:10.385
I really do.

14:11.324 --> 14:13.025
So, I...

14:13.061 --> 14:17.353
I need to know that you're not
gonna abandon her again.

14:17.388 --> 14:19.194
She can't handle that.

14:19.229 --> 14:22.034
What do I have to do
to prove it to you?

14:24.504 --> 14:26.698
Stick around.

14:34.648 --> 14:38.017
A lunch date isn't enough.

14:40.587 --> 14:42.521
You got to be patient.

14:42.556 --> 14:43.686
It's been 10 years.

14:43.722 --> 14:45.216
FRANK:
I get it.

14:45.251 --> 14:46.359
You've been in there.

14:46.394 --> 14:47.651
Nothing to do

14:47.687 --> 14:51.096
but think about who you have
on the outside.

14:51.131 --> 14:53.832
And then you get on the outside
and you realize that

14:53.867 --> 14:56.567
everybody else has been
moving on.

14:56.602 --> 14:58.031
Except for you.

14:58.066 --> 14:58.736
FRANK:
Except me?

14:58.771 --> 15:01.002
What do you mean except me?

15:01.038 --> 15:02.899
You see this empire I've built?

15:02.934 --> 15:05.503
No, I just mean that you
didn't turn your back on me.

15:05.538 --> 15:08.539
No, I'd never turn my back
on you.

15:08.575 --> 15:12.678
Beth moved on
and you fucked up bad.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.718
Thanks, Frank.

15:14.754 --> 15:16.279
FRANK:
I mean real bad.

15:16.314 --> 15:17.183
Yeah, I get it.

15:17.219 --> 15:19.789
She bounced back all by herself.

15:19.824 --> 15:21.852
She doesn't need you.

15:21.887 --> 15:26.698
But if you're patient,
if you keep your nose clean,

15:26.733 --> 15:27.998
if you're good to Lindsay,

15:28.033 --> 15:30.597
and if you take care
of yourself,

15:30.633 --> 15:33.796
someday she might remember
what you two used to have

15:33.831 --> 15:37.472
and want just a little bit
of that back.

15:40.472 --> 15:45.315
Man, when'd you get so deep?

15:45.350 --> 15:50.122
I'm just a man who made
a lot of mistakes in life.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.122
Rise and shine,
Good Behavior.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.462
You got a job.

15:58.497 --> 16:00.462
Okay.

16:01.302 --> 16:02.497
Okay.

16:19.785 --> 16:21.681
You're the locksmith?

16:22.547 --> 16:23.653
You called us, didn't you?

16:23.689 --> 16:25.652
That's cute.

16:26.654 --> 16:29.659
These digital locks,
they're the best, right?

16:29.695 --> 16:30.886
Definitely.

16:30.922 --> 16:33.497
And I can change the code
whenever I want?

16:33.532 --> 16:35.266
I guess.

16:35.301 --> 16:38.528
GARRETT:
You think you could do
a few more units?

16:38.564 --> 16:40.130
Yeah, I got more stock in here.

16:40.165 --> 16:40.804
Great.

16:40.839 --> 16:42.939
Let's get it going.

16:42.975 --> 16:44.741
So, all these rentals are yours?

16:44.776 --> 16:45.668
GARRETT:
Yeah.

16:45.704 --> 16:46.769
With tenants coming
and going,

16:46.805 --> 16:50.012
it'll be nice just to be able
to reset some codes.

16:50.047 --> 16:52.644
Looks like business is good.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.350
You know,
you came highly recommended.

16:54.385 --> 16:57.182
Well, there's not a lock
that Frank can't fix.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.348
No, not Frank.

16:58.383 --> 17:01.021
Miller, right?

17:01.056 --> 17:02.020
Miller Graham.

17:02.055 --> 17:03.354
Yeah.

17:03.389 --> 17:04.530
Someone referred you.

17:04.565 --> 17:05.465
I doubt it, man.

17:05.500 --> 17:06.497
I just started.

17:06.532 --> 17:07.758
No.

17:07.793 --> 17:08.799
April Reyes,
this girl that works for me,

17:08.834 --> 17:09.692
she said you were good

17:09.728 --> 17:11.528
and I thought,
"good locksmith?"

17:11.564 --> 17:12.396
What the fuck does that mean?

17:12.431 --> 17:13.636
April works for you?

17:13.671 --> 17:14.531
Mm-hmm.

17:14.567 --> 17:15.933
And she lives right over here.

17:17.042 --> 17:19.678
I give her a break on the rent.

17:19.713 --> 17:21.576
She a friend of yours?

17:22.647 --> 17:23.374
Yeah.

17:23.409 --> 17:24.479
I used to know her.

17:24.514 --> 17:27.652
Well, you must have left quite
an impression.

18:14.967 --> 18:17.770
I'm looking for a locksmith.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.772
Think you can help me out?

18:19.808 --> 18:21.664
No, sorry I'm just a handyman.

18:21.699 --> 18:23.734
But I'll see if Frank's in.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.542
What about that job
I just got you?

18:31.584 --> 18:32.883
April?

18:32.918 --> 18:35.081
You didn't recognize me.

18:35.117 --> 18:37.115
I just uh...

18:37.150 --> 18:39.052
Damn.

18:39.087 --> 18:39.790
You're...

18:39.826 --> 18:43.421
What... an adult?

18:43.456 --> 18:45.455
All grown up, yeah.

18:48.265 --> 18:49.903
Thanks for getting me that job.

18:49.938 --> 18:50.934
Kevin would have wanted
to see you

18:50.969 --> 18:52.832
get back on your feet.

18:57.805 --> 19:02.138
So, what are you up to
now that you're out?

19:03.674 --> 19:05.443
You're looking at it.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.947
No more safe cracking?

19:06.982 --> 19:08.713
No.

19:08.749 --> 19:11.591
That's a mistake
I won't make again.

19:11.626 --> 19:12.882
That's too bad.

19:12.917 --> 19:14.825
I heard you were pretty good
at it.

19:14.861 --> 19:16.628
Yeah, people talk.

19:16.664 --> 19:17.421
Oh, come on.

19:17.456 --> 19:18.764
You were good.

19:18.799 --> 19:19.730
You were really good.

19:19.766 --> 19:21.291
I was okay.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.697
Okay?

19:24.032 --> 19:24.837
Alright.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.602
I was pretty fucking great.

19:28.436 --> 19:29.638
Well, for jobs like that,

19:29.674 --> 19:33.510
it must be really hard
to find a good partner, right?

19:36.016 --> 19:39.142
Someone you can trust entirely.

19:42.883 --> 19:45.957
I wish I never brought him
there that night.

19:45.992 --> 19:48.118
I'm not talking about Kevin.

19:50.391 --> 19:51.992
I need money, Miller.

19:52.027 --> 19:53.790
Bad.

19:53.826 --> 19:54.865
Are you in some kind
of trouble

19:54.900 --> 19:56.192
or something?

19:57.603 --> 20:00.636
I'll tell you if you say
you'll help me get out of it.

20:06.871 --> 20:09.744
You know I'd do anything
for you.

20:16.887 --> 20:17.657
Hey!

20:17.692 --> 20:18.852
Hey, wait a sec.

20:18.887 --> 20:20.393
No, people always say
they'll do anything for you

20:20.428 --> 20:22.653
right before they tell you
why they won't do anything.

20:22.688 --> 20:24.327
April, the shit I was doing,

20:24.362 --> 20:25.823
it's the kind
of stuff people do,

20:25.858 --> 20:27.199
when they're trying
to cut corners.

20:27.234 --> 20:29.658
And I promise it catches up
with you.

20:29.694 --> 20:30.496
I did time for it.

20:30.531 --> 20:31.769
Yeah, you did time for it.

20:31.804 --> 20:32.905
And Kevin?

20:32.941 --> 20:34.566
What exactly are you asking me?

20:34.602 --> 20:35.802
Oh, I'm not asking you anything.

20:35.837 --> 20:38.910
You're not gonna help me,
so I'm not asking.

20:38.945 --> 20:40.878
Did that do it for Beth?

20:40.913 --> 20:42.810
"I did my time".

20:47.720 --> 20:48.381
Okay.

20:48.416 --> 20:50.314
Just wait a second.

20:50.349 --> 20:51.118
Hold on.

20:51.154 --> 20:52.688
Let's talk.

21:08.634 --> 21:11.235
Sounded good out there.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.279
I think April just asked me
to help her with a robbery.

21:14.314 --> 21:15.946
That's not someone your PO
would want you

21:15.982 --> 21:17.878
to associate with.

21:19.452 --> 21:21.787
Still, I got to find some way
to help her.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.714
Not like that.

21:23.749 --> 21:25.919
Keep your eyes on the prize.

21:28.092 --> 21:29.553
You're right.

21:51.943 --> 21:53.984
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

22:23.675 --> 22:24.917
Hi officers.

22:24.952 --> 22:26.676
Is there a problem?

22:53.541 --> 22:55.943
Early release, huh?

22:57.182 --> 22:58.946
For good behavior.

23:01.756 --> 23:03.049
Come out.

23:04.385 --> 23:05.716
Let's go!

23:05.751 --> 23:07.860
Step out of the vehicle.

23:17.763 --> 23:19.769
What do you want, Zwick?

23:22.734 --> 23:25.475
You know, I...

23:25.510 --> 23:27.144
I don't know what sorts
of thoughts

23:27.179 --> 23:28.078
go through a man's head

23:28.114 --> 23:29.380
when he's locked in a box
for 10 years.

23:29.416 --> 23:31.076
But I just thought I'd pay you
a visit.

23:31.112 --> 23:33.882
You know, bring you up
to speed on a few things.

23:35.615 --> 23:37.818
I'm retiring.

23:37.854 --> 23:39.984
I'm gonna spend my afternoons
playing golf

23:40.019 --> 23:42.427
and getting buzzed on
Bud Lights.

23:42.462 --> 23:44.929
And I have you to thank partly
for that.

23:44.965 --> 23:45.797
Busting you

23:45.832 --> 23:46.824
and your friend was one
of the things

23:46.860 --> 23:49.198
that got bumped to Lieutenant.

23:49.233 --> 23:52.128
But you know,

23:52.163 --> 23:56.003
these gentlemen
are not retiring.

23:56.777 --> 23:57.706
Miller,

23:57.741 --> 24:00.071
please meet Detectives Perez
and Jones.

24:00.106 --> 24:04.746
Detectives Perez and Jones,
meet Miller.

24:04.781 --> 24:06.611
Man, you told me to never
breathe a word.

24:06.646 --> 24:07.449
And I didn't.

24:07.484 --> 24:08.380
And I commend you for that.

24:08.415 --> 24:08.919
I do.

24:08.954 --> 24:09.448
I do.

24:09.483 --> 24:10.153
I just...

24:10.189 --> 24:11.120
Just hey, come on.

24:11.156 --> 24:12.448
Hey, hey...

24:14.327 --> 24:17.189
I need you to know something.

24:17.224 --> 24:20.831
That if you ever try
and fuck with me in any way,

24:20.866 --> 24:24.999
these gentlemen can and will
make your life miserable.

24:31.969 --> 24:32.735
What are you doing?

24:43.288 --> 24:45.151
We got something.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.286
Well, well, well Miller.

24:49.230 --> 24:50.924
He's a convicted felon, Chief.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.622
He had his locksmithing
certification revoked.

24:52.657 --> 24:53.830
Yeah,

24:53.865 --> 24:55.865
but did you actually see him
use the kit though?

24:57.136 --> 24:58.130
I mean, no sir,

24:58.165 --> 24:59.429
but you got to understand,
is this guy here--

24:59.465 --> 25:02.674
Then what the hell is he doing
in my station in cuffs?

25:05.146 --> 25:07.173
Are you out of your mind?

25:08.213 --> 25:09.805
It was Zwick.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.183
Oh, come on.

25:11.219 --> 25:12.481
Zwick wasn't anyone near this.

25:12.517 --> 25:14.053
I was making a run for Frank.

25:14.088 --> 25:15.847
It's a locksmith van.

25:15.883 --> 25:17.148
There's equipment in the back.

25:17.184 --> 25:19.417
Then, don't drive around
in a locksmith van.

25:19.452 --> 25:22.460
They would have pulled me over
if I was on roller blades.

25:22.496 --> 25:23.726
It didn't matter
what I was driving.

25:23.761 --> 25:25.690
Everything matters
at this point, Miller.

25:25.726 --> 25:27.122
You're on parole.

25:27.158 --> 25:29.828
Another mistake and you're done.

25:29.863 --> 25:31.661
Look, next time, detectives,

25:31.696 --> 25:35.575
just use a little due diligence
before you haul someone in here.

25:44.184 --> 25:44.817
Detective Fisher.

25:44.852 --> 25:46.619
Chief.

25:48.253 --> 25:50.555
Mr. Graham.

25:50.591 --> 25:53.817
You can't locksmith
without a certificate.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.017
I know that, sir.

25:55.052 --> 25:56.360
I'm just a handyman.

25:56.395 --> 25:57.527
Yeah, you mentioned that.

25:57.562 --> 26:00.166
But I don't know
if I believe it.

26:00.201 --> 26:01.290
But as there's no evidence

26:01.326 --> 26:03.200
of any illegal activity
on your part,

26:03.236 --> 26:04.493
you're free to go.

26:04.528 --> 26:07.233
But if I ever see you
in this station again,

26:07.269 --> 26:10.075
I will call your parole
officer, you understand that?

26:10.110 --> 26:11.809
I understand.

26:14.115 --> 26:15.673
You're free to go.

26:15.709 --> 26:17.276
Uncuff him.

26:25.983 --> 26:27.386
SHARON:
Okay.

26:27.421 --> 26:30.260
Let's start with having you
come by two times a week.

26:30.295 --> 26:31.255
Twice a week?

26:31.290 --> 26:33.296
Late to your first meeting,
Mr. Graham.

26:33.331 --> 26:34.530
Not a good look.

26:34.566 --> 26:35.901
That's not gonna happen again.

26:35.936 --> 26:37.303
Good.

26:37.338 --> 26:39.736
I'll see you next Monday
on time.

26:39.772 --> 26:42.141
Oh, and grab the cup
on that window outside

26:42.176 --> 26:43.901
with your name on it.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.242
Bathroom's to the left.

26:45.278 --> 26:46.243
When you're done,

26:46.279 --> 26:48.079
put your sample on the tray
with the others.

26:48.115 --> 26:49.473
Yes, ma'am.

26:51.175 --> 26:53.083
MILLER:
Frank, you here?

26:53.118 --> 26:54.984
Yeah.

26:59.853 --> 27:02.184
You missed a job.

27:02.219 --> 27:03.293
Guy said you stood him up.

27:03.328 --> 27:05.324
Yeah, I'm sorry.

27:05.359 --> 27:08.258
Some shit came up today
that was beyond my control.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.159
FRANK:
Look, I know you just got out.

27:10.195 --> 27:12.529
But you can't be missing jobs.

27:12.564 --> 27:15.235
They got something called
“Yelp” nowadays.

27:17.868 --> 27:19.910
Hey uh,

27:19.946 --> 27:22.312
you think you could take me on
as an actual handyman?

27:22.347 --> 27:24.279
Actual handyman.

27:24.314 --> 27:25.643
Huh.

27:25.678 --> 27:27.053
Okay.

27:27.088 --> 27:29.144
No bump in pay.

27:29.179 --> 27:30.582
There are some benefits.

27:30.617 --> 27:31.986
Yeah?

27:32.021 --> 27:35.918
You get your own special mop
and bucket.

27:40.300 --> 27:41.332
Okay, Indie, paw, paw.

27:41.368 --> 27:42.234
BETH:
Linds, come on!

27:42.269 --> 27:43.432
We're gonna be late.

27:43.468 --> 27:44.432
I'm almost ready.

27:44.468 --> 27:46.765
Shake, good.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.336
Yes, good job.

27:48.371 --> 27:48.998
Ready?

27:49.034 --> 27:50.941
This isn't ready.

27:50.976 --> 27:53.468
Is that what you're wearing
to the party tonight?

27:53.504 --> 27:55.478
I'm not going
to the party tonight.

27:55.513 --> 27:56.781
Allison can't come over,

27:56.817 --> 28:00.009
so I thought you
and I could make some popcorn

28:00.045 --> 28:02.321
and watch a movie.

28:02.356 --> 28:04.055
Why, what's wrong with this?

28:04.090 --> 28:04.585
Nothing.

28:04.620 --> 28:06.490
It looks fine.

28:06.525 --> 28:08.794
Why don't you just ask dad?

28:08.829 --> 28:10.823
I think your father needs just
a little more time

28:10.858 --> 28:12.731
getting settled in.

28:12.766 --> 28:15.427
If he's not busy,
I'm sure he can handle it.

28:15.462 --> 28:17.365
And you can go to the party
and have fun for once.

28:17.928 --> 28:18.633
Fun?

28:18.668 --> 28:20.338
Remind me what that is?

28:20.373 --> 28:21.030
I'll think about it.

28:21.066 --> 28:22.434
Come on, let's go.

28:24.872 --> 28:26.310
Guys, yeah, alright.

28:26.346 --> 28:28.008
Alright, alright.

28:28.044 --> 28:29.945
Lieutenant Zwick's work
with this force

28:29.980 --> 28:32.542
has been a deep service
to our community

28:32.577 --> 28:36.321
and I would like to personally
congratulate him

28:36.356 --> 28:38.356
on an incredible career.

28:38.391 --> 28:40.091
OFFICERS:
Yeah.

28:40.126 --> 28:41.519
Speech!

28:45.496 --> 28:47.500
Um, I'm just...

28:47.535 --> 28:49.401
I'm happy
to have left the streets

28:49.437 --> 28:51.894
of Dos Caminos a little safer.

28:51.929 --> 28:53.298
And uh,

28:53.334 --> 28:55.508
serving with some of the
Borderland's finest

28:55.543 --> 28:59.311
has been the honor
of my lifetime.

28:59.346 --> 29:02.246
And so uh, thank you.

29:02.281 --> 29:04.843
Um, and...

29:04.878 --> 29:05.950
One more thing.

29:07.513 --> 29:10.512
Miller Graham,
the man I put away the night

29:10.548 --> 29:12.581
I was under fire
in the line of duty

29:12.616 --> 29:15.760
has recently been released
from prison.

29:15.795 --> 29:19.392
So uh, watch your six out
there, fellas.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.594
Oh, and of course,

29:23.629 --> 29:27.371
attendance at my party later on
is mandatory, alright.

29:27.407 --> 29:28.808
Fisher, my office.

29:34.673 --> 29:40.182
Beth, with my retirement
we are down a man on Vice.

29:41.819 --> 29:45.189
I'd like you to fill that slot.

29:45.224 --> 29:45.751
Wow.

29:46.821 --> 29:48.392
Really, um....

29:48.428 --> 29:50.494
Here you go, boys.

29:50.529 --> 29:52.329
I'm just a little um...

29:52.364 --> 29:54.056
Surprised?

29:55.102 --> 29:55.367
Yes.

29:55.402 --> 29:57.392
Yeah.

29:57.427 --> 29:59.562
I'm not as stupid as I look.

29:59.597 --> 30:02.441
And I'm sure it hasn't always
been easy

30:02.476 --> 30:04.109
having me as a supervisor

30:04.144 --> 30:07.503
given what happened between me
and that asshole ex of yours.

30:07.539 --> 30:09.507
Just consider this my way
of saying,

30:09.543 --> 30:12.049
I always thought you were
good police, Fisher.

30:15.113 --> 30:16.083
Oh well, I--

30:16.118 --> 30:19.122
I can't just drop
my other cases.

30:20.493 --> 30:21.485
Yeah, by the way,

30:21.520 --> 30:23.825
I wouldn't worry too much
about that.

30:23.861 --> 30:26.495
Those will all get transitioned.

30:26.530 --> 30:27.590
This is--

30:27.626 --> 30:29.693
this is the real police work
here, you know.

30:31.831 --> 30:35.974
Beth, these men can't drink
their whisky until you accept.

30:43.515 --> 30:44.039
Then I accept.

30:44.074 --> 30:44.810
Whoo!

30:44.846 --> 30:45.812
There it is.

30:49.653 --> 30:50.353
Ah, there it is.

30:50.388 --> 30:51.049
Alright.

30:51.084 --> 30:52.114
Out of here, all of you.

30:52.149 --> 30:52.986
Thank you.

30:53.022 --> 30:53.621
We'll see you out there, Fisher.

30:53.656 --> 30:54.652
Yes, yes.

31:00.566 --> 31:02.528
Oh, Lieutenant, um...

31:02.564 --> 31:04.961
What is it exactly that you'd
like me to jump into?

31:04.996 --> 31:06.229
Oh.

31:06.264 --> 31:07.332
Yeah, just you know,

31:07.367 --> 31:08.300
just really dig
into the case files.

31:08.335 --> 31:10.206
Get a sense of what we're
working on here.

31:12.212 --> 31:13.411
Sir.

31:35.301 --> 31:36.694
Alright.

31:39.470 --> 31:40.572
Hello?

31:40.607 --> 31:41.765
<i>BETH :</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

31:41.801 --> 31:45.403
Um, there's this thing tonight
at the King of Spades.

31:45.438 --> 31:46.611
<i>MILLER :</i>
<i>The cop bar?</i>

31:46.646 --> 31:47.879
<i>BETH :</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:47.915 --> 31:49.679
I was wondering if you could
pick Lindsay up

31:49.714 --> 31:50.882
from her piano lesson

31:50.917 --> 31:52.941
and spend a little bit
of time with her.

31:52.976 --> 31:55.487
I usually ask the neighbor,
but she's not around.

31:55.522 --> 31:56.379
No, I would love that.

31:56.414 --> 31:57.515
<i>BETH :</i>
<i>Great.</i>

31:57.550 --> 31:59.557
Okay, so,
you got to go over her homework,

31:59.592 --> 32:00.450
make sure she's done it.

32:00.486 --> 32:01.818
<i>MILLER :</i>
<i>Hold on.</i>

32:04.264 --> 32:05.924
Okay.

32:05.959 --> 32:06.862
Homework.

32:06.898 --> 32:10.028
And no fast food, real dinner.

32:10.063 --> 32:12.070
No fast food.

32:12.670 --> 32:14.229
Okay, what else?

32:14.264 --> 32:15.174
That's it.

32:15.209 --> 32:16.701
Oh.

32:17.768 --> 32:19.609
I can drop her off at your
house after...

32:19.644 --> 32:20.236
Uh no, no, no.

32:20.271 --> 32:21.039
The bar is fine.

32:21.074 --> 32:22.511
Uh, I gotta go.

32:22.546 --> 32:23.073
Okay.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.546
Beth, um...

32:24.581 --> 32:26.043
Yeah?

32:26.078 --> 32:28.253
Thank you.

32:28.288 --> 32:29.813
You bet.

32:55.882 --> 32:57.407
MISS DANDUS:
See you next week, okay.

32:57.443 --> 32:58.240
LINDSAY:
Bye, Miss Dandus.

32:58.275 --> 32:59.810
Thank you.

33:02.388 --> 33:02.947
Hi, dad.

33:02.982 --> 33:04.688
Hey.

33:04.723 --> 33:06.489
That sounded so good.

33:06.524 --> 33:07.625
Thanks.

33:07.660 --> 33:08.920
Got all your stuff?

33:08.955 --> 33:09.693
Yeah.

33:09.728 --> 33:10.955
Alright, let's bounce.

33:10.990 --> 33:12.262
Okay.

33:14.627 --> 33:16.431
Do you anything you're really
good at?

33:17.832 --> 33:19.698
Hm.

33:21.002 --> 33:22.564
Not really.

33:22.599 --> 33:24.775
What about picking locks?

33:24.810 --> 33:27.479
Mom told me you're the best.

33:27.515 --> 33:29.105
She did, did she?

33:29.140 --> 33:29.972
Mhmmm.

33:33.752 --> 33:35.120
Will you show me?

33:39.087 --> 33:40.019
I see that smile.

33:42.956 --> 33:43.961
Alright.

33:43.997 --> 33:45.658
Give me a couple
of your bobby pins.

33:49.094 --> 33:50.458
Okay.

33:50.494 --> 33:51.529
Most people think

33:51.564 --> 33:53.566
picking locks
is like mysterious.

33:53.602 --> 33:56.568
But locks are actually kind
of easy to crack.

33:56.603 --> 33:58.239
You don't even need a kit
like I use.

33:58.275 --> 34:01.745
Alright,
so this is your tension lever.

34:01.780 --> 34:04.774
And this is your pick.

34:04.809 --> 34:06.182
So, we're going
to take the tension lever

34:06.217 --> 34:08.811
and stick it in the bottom
of the lock.

34:08.847 --> 34:10.689
Okay, now there's five pins
in this lock.

34:10.724 --> 34:12.685
We're gonna take the pick

34:12.720 --> 34:16.851
and put it in the lock
just above the tension lever.

34:16.887 --> 34:20.231
And we're going to feel
for the pins.

34:20.266 --> 34:22.391
Now, one of the pins is
gonna be harder to push up

34:22.426 --> 34:23.735
than the others.

34:23.771 --> 34:25.794
It's called the "seized pin".

34:25.830 --> 34:28.538
And that's the one
we're looking for.

34:28.573 --> 34:30.574
So...

34:30.610 --> 34:31.567
Okay there.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.002
There, there, there, that guy.

34:33.038 --> 34:37.149
Right now push him up
while you turn the tension lever

34:39.784 --> 34:41.978
and guess what?

34:47.218 --> 34:48.052
Hey.

34:48.087 --> 34:49.392
Hey.

34:50.721 --> 34:53.222
Oh, looks like someone had fun.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.292
Yeah.

34:54.327 --> 34:55.499
We had a good time.

34:55.534 --> 34:56.729
We did.

34:58.171 --> 35:01.263
Homework is done
and we had a nice dinner.

35:01.298 --> 35:02.800
Great.

35:02.835 --> 35:05.236
And you are my excuse
for a quick exit, so...

35:05.944 --> 35:06.642
Let's get you home, missy.

35:06.677 --> 35:07.404
Okay.

35:07.439 --> 35:08.746
That's a lot of people.

35:08.781 --> 35:10.548
What's the occasion?

35:10.583 --> 35:11.339
Hey, baby?

35:11.374 --> 35:12.212
Yeah?

35:12.248 --> 35:13.550
Why don't you wait in the car?

35:13.585 --> 35:14.311
Sure.

35:14.346 --> 35:15.385
BETH:
Okay.

35:17.017 --> 35:20.252
Um...

35:20.287 --> 35:22.889
Zwick's retirement.

35:22.924 --> 35:24.563
Mm.

35:24.598 --> 35:27.455
Miller, come on.

35:27.491 --> 35:28.733
I had to go.

35:28.768 --> 35:31.632
Yeah, it's your job.

35:31.668 --> 35:37.940
Well, with Zwick out,
there's an opening on Vice, so.

35:37.975 --> 35:40.841
And you're taking it?

35:40.876 --> 35:42.847
Yeah.

35:42.883 --> 35:45.307
Anyway, thank you for tonight.

35:45.342 --> 35:47.076
Yeah.

35:48.686 --> 35:50.312
Night.

35:50.347 --> 35:52.257
Night.

35:58.828 --> 36:00.823
Miller!

36:00.858 --> 36:04.936
Did uh,
Beth tell you the good news?

36:04.972 --> 36:07.170
That you no longer have
a badge?

36:07.205 --> 36:08.771
Yeah, I'm going home
to celebrate.

36:10.374 --> 36:13.168
That's--
That's actually pretty funny.

36:14.345 --> 36:20.018
You know uh,
Vice is a dangerous unit.

36:20.054 --> 36:23.946
I mean things happen out there,
okay.

36:23.981 --> 36:25.482
And all you got
are your fellow detectives

36:25.517 --> 36:27.325
to watch your back.

36:29.922 --> 36:32.990
It's a good thing she's got
Perez and Jones.

36:48.611 --> 36:51.112
April, what the hell are you
doing here?

36:51.147 --> 36:53.510
I'm in trouble, Miller.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.478
The man I work for...

36:55.513 --> 36:57.381
Real estate guy?

36:57.416 --> 36:58.950
That's a front.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.360
A front for what?

37:09.934 --> 37:12.161
He runs girls.

37:14.940 --> 37:17.235
So, you're like a...

37:17.271 --> 37:18.772
A call girl.

37:21.873 --> 37:26.411
Don't you dare fucking
judge me.

37:26.446 --> 37:28.813
I didn't choose this.

37:28.848 --> 37:32.156
After Kevin died,
I didn't have anyone.

37:32.191 --> 37:34.892
There was no one there
to stop it.

37:34.927 --> 37:37.692
He won't let me go.

37:37.727 --> 37:40.957
Last year, I tried to run
and he beat me so bad

37:40.992 --> 37:43.935
I was in the hospital
for three weeks.

37:43.970 --> 37:46.364
And he's still hurting me.

38:02.748 --> 38:04.053
We have to go to the police now.

38:04.088 --> 38:05.921
No, they're in on it.

38:05.957 --> 38:06.883
Beth's not.

38:06.919 --> 38:09.554
I'm telling you
it is not gonna work.

38:09.589 --> 38:11.087
I need to get out of town.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.854
I need to go somewhere
they will never find me.

38:12.889 --> 38:14.029
And I need money to do it.

38:14.065 --> 38:16.467
You know I can't.

38:16.502 --> 38:17.934
So, you're just gonna
let them keep hurting me?

38:17.970 --> 38:18.928
I swore to myself

38:18.963 --> 38:20.597
when I walked through
those gates

38:20.632 --> 38:21.397
that I'd stay clean

38:21.433 --> 38:23.065
and I'd spend the rest
of my life

38:23.100 --> 38:24.468
making it up to you, Beth,
and Lindsay.

38:24.503 --> 38:25.539
APRIL:
Yeah.

38:25.574 --> 38:27.746
Just not necessarily
in that order.

38:27.781 --> 38:28.939
Hey, that's...

38:28.974 --> 38:30.940
Look, you don't give a shit
about me.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.909
You say you want to make it up
to me,

38:32.944 --> 38:34.309
but just tell me
the fucking truth.

38:34.344 --> 38:36.052
You just care about getting
your real family back.

38:36.087 --> 38:36.951
You're family, too.

38:36.986 --> 38:37.681
No.

38:37.716 --> 38:40.983
Kevin was my real family.

38:41.018 --> 38:43.260
He was the only family
I ever had.

38:43.296 --> 38:44.896
And none of this
would have happened

38:44.931 --> 38:46.365
if he was still alive.

38:51.035 --> 38:53.603
What's the job?

38:55.974 --> 38:58.303
A poker game.

38:58.339 --> 38:59.843
Easy money.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.846
You hit it.

39:01.881 --> 39:04.639
I take the cash.

39:04.674 --> 39:05.648
And I run.

39:06.979 --> 39:09.212
APRIL:
Then you'll have made it up
to me.

39:10.983 --> 39:12.923
It'll just be
a few questions, ma'am.

39:26.169 --> 39:27.696
BETH:
Hm.

39:27.731 --> 39:29.705
I know this one.

39:29.740 --> 39:31.634
Used to run around
with my friend's younger sister.

39:31.669 --> 39:32.667
PEREZ:
Yeah?

39:32.703 --> 39:33.977
Small town.

39:47.557 --> 39:49.719
Zero record
of prostitution arrests

39:49.754 --> 39:51.988
in the last three years.

39:52.023 --> 39:54.156
Like I said,
Fisher, small town.

39:54.192 --> 39:56.666
What, people don't pay
for sex in small towns.

39:59.837 --> 40:02.104
MILLER:
Yo, I thought you said
this was a poker game.

40:02.139 --> 40:03.442
APRIL:
It is.

40:04.443 --> 40:07.044
Looks like a whole fucking
party to me.

40:07.079 --> 40:08.739
That's a lot of eyes.

40:08.775 --> 40:11.742
It's nothing you can't handle.

40:11.778 --> 40:13.050
Garrett does this every month.

40:13.085 --> 40:14.076
He dresses up the game

40:14.111 --> 40:17.379
like it's some
classy casino night.

40:17.414 --> 40:19.984
Charges a high buy-in,
the buy-in goes into the pot.

40:20.019 --> 40:21.322
And then he takes a big cut
for hosting,

40:21.357 --> 40:22.559
on top of what he makes

40:22.594 --> 40:24.193
from the girls working
the players all night.

40:24.228 --> 40:25.389
And who are the players?

40:25.424 --> 40:27.159
Execs.

40:27.194 --> 40:29.056
Business types that drive
into town just for the game.

40:29.092 --> 40:31.032
They're definitely not trouble.

40:32.698 --> 40:34.371
So, you take the money,

40:34.406 --> 40:35.898
and I'll meet you back
at Frank's

40:35.933 --> 40:37.040
when I'm done for the night.

40:37.075 --> 40:39.340
What's the take?

40:39.375 --> 40:40.604
Half a million dollars.

40:40.639 --> 40:41.609
MILLER:
What?

40:41.645 --> 40:43.112
That's a fucking shit ton
of money.

40:43.147 --> 40:44.139
APRIL:
Yeah.

40:44.174 --> 40:45.484
Enough for me
to start a new life.

40:48.078 --> 40:50.912
MILLER:
So, what about security?

40:50.947 --> 40:52.315
You're looking at it.

40:57.393 --> 40:59.025
Why am I not surprised?

41:00.164 --> 41:01.423
Three years ago,

41:01.459 --> 41:03.595
all these women were picked up
on prostitution charges.

41:03.630 --> 41:05.803
Then arrests dry up.

41:05.838 --> 41:06.598
Okay.

41:06.633 --> 41:07.635
So, we booked them,

41:07.670 --> 41:08.600
they stopped turning
their tricks.

41:08.635 --> 41:10.137
Sounds like a win to me.

41:10.172 --> 41:11.032
No, no.

41:11.068 --> 41:12.841
Come here, look at the files.

41:19.179 --> 41:21.646
Each woman gives the same
street as their address.

41:21.681 --> 41:22.780
The same development.

41:22.815 --> 41:24.419
All owned by Garrett Field.

41:24.454 --> 41:26.421
Okay, so I'm not following.

41:26.456 --> 41:28.418
Well, maybe you're right.

41:28.453 --> 41:31.726
Maybe they all just found
different forms of occupation.

41:31.761 --> 41:34.124
Or, maybe whoever
they're working for

41:34.160 --> 41:36.624
just got a little bit better
at hiding it.

41:37.160 --> 41:38.201
WOMAN AT PARTY:
Go high, boys.

41:39.036 --> 41:40.162
Piece.

41:40.197 --> 41:42.765
MAN AT PARTY:

42:36.185 --> 42:37.153
MAN 1:
Where are we going?

42:37.188 --> 42:38.162
WOMAN 1:
We should have some privacy.

42:38.197 --> 42:39.028
MAN 1:
Like that.

42:39.063 --> 42:39.722
Yeah.

43:24.075 --> 43:25.039
Shit!

43:27.276 --> 43:28.170
Fuck.

43:28.205 --> 43:29.411
I'm so sorry.
Let me see that.

43:29.446 --> 43:30.913
Um, let me help you.

43:32.878 --> 43:34.185
I'll help you carry it.

43:35.815 --> 43:37.411
It was an accident.

43:37.447 --> 43:38.387
GARRETT:
Do you know how embarrassing--

43:38.422 --> 43:39.418
Get over here and sit.

43:39.453 --> 43:40.223
Ow!

43:40.259 --> 43:41.357
You're hurting me.

43:42.427 --> 43:45.128
MAN 2:

43:45.163 --> 43:45.756
Thank you.

44:36.807 --> 44:37.848
Come on!

44:46.289 --> 44:46.982
Let go!

44:52.196 --> 44:53.556
Hey.

44:56.493 --> 44:58.768
You better know how
to use that thing.

44:58.803 --> 45:01.300
You're gonna need it
to get out of here.

45:03.243 --> 45:04.275
What are you doing?

45:04.310 --> 45:05.843
You-- you got the money!

45:07.246 --> 45:08.676
Don't be stupid.

45:08.712 --> 45:10.380
There are 30 people out there.

45:10.415 --> 45:11.348
You pull that trigger,

45:11.383 --> 45:13.213
you'll be dead before
you reach the door.

45:21.227 --> 45:23.227
Who are you?

45:39.268 --> 45:40.242
Hey, stop right there!

45:40.277 --> 45:41.109
Freeze!

45:52.083 --> 45:53.521
Hey, stay calm, man.

45:53.556 --> 45:54.025
MILLER:
You!

45:54.060 --> 45:54.889
Back off

45:54.924 --> 45:56.050
or I'll blow
her fucking brains out.

45:56.085 --> 45:56.922
Let me go!

45:56.958 --> 45:57.756
You don't wanna do this, man.

45:57.791 --> 45:59.094
I said back off!

46:01.357 --> 46:02.225
JONES:
Be the smart guy.

46:02.261 --> 46:03.560
We can all walk away
from this.

46:05.269 --> 46:06.101
Come on.

46:07.130 --> 46:08.030
Hey, hey, hey!

46:19.778 --> 46:21.446
Fuck!

46:23.213 --> 46:24.680
Enjoying your cocktail?

46:26.158 --> 46:27.381
Useless!

46:27.416 --> 46:28.457
And where the hell were you?

46:28.493 --> 46:30.017
He overpowered me.

46:30.052 --> 46:31.926
Really?

46:31.962 --> 46:33.396
You got something
to say about that?

46:33.431 --> 46:34.798
Just save it.

46:34.834 --> 46:37.297
Just find out who he is
and get my money back.

46:41.438 --> 46:42.874
Fucking...

47:08.527 --> 47:09.598
<i>APRIL :</i>
<i>Hey, it's April.</i>

47:09.633 --> 47:11.166
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

47:16.508 --> 47:17.031
<i>Hey, it's April.</i>

47:17.066 --> 47:18.001
Shit!

47:51.573 --> 47:53.542
April?

48:05.950 --> 48:07.886
April?

48:22.140 --> 48:25.267
Please tell me your father
didn't teach you that?

48:25.302 --> 48:27.036
I saw it on YouTube.

48:27.072 --> 48:28.236
Yeah, right!

48:28.271 --> 48:29.274
Hand 'em over

48:29.309 --> 48:30.613
before I throw you
in the slammer!

48:30.648 --> 48:32.139
Oh no, not the slammer.

48:34.586 --> 48:35.712
Eat your breakfast.

48:37.652 --> 48:38.550
Okay.

48:40.688 --> 48:41.522
Tanya?

48:41.557 --> 48:42.524
Beth.

48:42.559 --> 48:43.458
Long time.

48:43.493 --> 48:44.394
Yeah.

48:44.429 --> 48:45.462
Uh, Linds,

48:45.497 --> 48:46.331
why didn't you finish
getting ready for school?

48:46.366 --> 48:46.925
Uh, take Indie.

48:46.960 --> 48:47.793
Come on, Indie.

48:47.828 --> 48:48.255
Thank you.

48:48.291 --> 48:49.594
Come on in.

48:50.568 --> 48:51.400
There you go.

48:51.435 --> 48:53.563
Thanks.

48:53.598 --> 48:58.399
Um, so April and I,
we work together,

48:58.434 --> 49:01.269
you know like um...

49:01.304 --> 49:02.571
entertaining.

49:02.606 --> 49:04.648
TANYA:
At first, I really liked it.

49:04.683 --> 49:06.383
You know, I had nice things.

49:06.419 --> 49:08.216
A home, car.

49:08.251 --> 49:10.112
So, when Garrett asked me
to April about it,

49:10.148 --> 49:11.352
I just did.

49:11.387 --> 49:14.082
You mean, Garrett Field,
the real estate developer?

49:14.117 --> 49:15.950
Yeah.

49:15.985 --> 49:18.392
And I mean I wouldn't have
asked April about it,

49:18.427 --> 49:20.963
if I knew that it was gonna
turn into what it did.

49:20.998 --> 49:24.600
You know, the car
and the clothes;

49:24.636 --> 49:25.467
none of its ours.

49:28.039 --> 49:30.498
He even puts us up
in these nice places,

49:30.534 --> 49:32.568
but he owns them all, you know.

49:32.603 --> 49:35.138
If any of us ever try
to get out,

49:35.173 --> 49:36.781
it would be bad.

49:36.816 --> 49:39.942
Here, I want to show you
something.

49:39.978 --> 49:42.680
I don't know what'll happen
if he finds out I took these.

49:50.525 --> 49:53.229
April's been having a lot
of issues with Garrett.

49:53.265 --> 49:55.633
The other day she shows me
these bruises on her arm.

49:55.668 --> 49:56.667
And then last night I hear

49:56.702 --> 49:58.734
what sounds like a break-in
at her apartment.

49:58.769 --> 50:00.832
And now, she's just...

50:00.867 --> 50:02.402
gone.

50:02.437 --> 50:05.366
This morning I see Miller going
into her place.

50:05.401 --> 50:07.302
BETH:
Miller?

50:07.337 --> 50:09.171
Are you sure?

50:09.207 --> 50:11.049
It was him.

50:15.585 --> 50:17.550
Shit.

50:23.061 --> 50:26.658
This is a job April asked you
to pull.

50:31.834 --> 50:33.830
Are you insane?

50:34.540 --> 50:35.698
I can explain...

50:35.733 --> 50:38.202
No, that's a serious question
I'm asking

50:38.237 --> 50:39.776
and I need an answer.

50:39.811 --> 50:41.710
Are you out of your mind?

50:41.745 --> 50:42.744
They took her.

50:42.779 --> 50:44.139
She's missing.

50:44.174 --> 50:45.306
Oh.

50:45.341 --> 50:46.684
Oh, I'm--

50:46.719 --> 50:49.814
I'm trying to understand,

50:49.849 --> 50:55.222
why you would get yourself
involved in something like this?

50:55.257 --> 50:57.728
Do you want to go back
to prison?

50:57.763 --> 50:59.829
They're hurting her, Frank.

50:59.864 --> 51:02.032
She showed me the bruises.

51:02.067 --> 51:03.925
Okay, this girls needs
to get out of town

51:03.960 --> 51:05.668
and this was the only way
she could think of

51:05.704 --> 51:06.604
to get the money.

51:06.639 --> 51:08.666
The part I'm missing is,

51:08.702 --> 51:12.841
you explaining how
that's your responsibility.

51:12.876 --> 51:15.475
'Cause I owe her.

51:15.510 --> 51:17.775
What am I supposed to do
just let her get killed?

51:21.450 --> 51:26.256
Look, I know you have
a tough choice to make.

51:28.123 --> 51:30.584
But you made the wrong one.

51:30.619 --> 51:32.256
You gotta go to Beth.

51:32.291 --> 51:34.258
She's the one you owe.

51:34.293 --> 51:35.766
Take this cash back.

51:35.801 --> 51:37.701
Tell her to go find April.

51:37.736 --> 51:38.801
And let her do her job.

51:38.836 --> 51:40.703
It's not that simple.

51:40.739 --> 51:41.664
Zwick's involved.

51:41.699 --> 51:42.765
Well, that's even more
of a reason

51:42.801 --> 51:44.840
why you need to tell her
to watch your back.

51:44.875 --> 51:46.878
It's too dangerous.

51:46.913 --> 51:48.878
Trust me,
she's safer not knowing.

51:48.914 --> 51:50.211
I gotta handle this on my own.

51:50.246 --> 51:52.749
You better hope
that you find her

51:52.784 --> 51:55.645
before they find you.

51:55.680 --> 51:57.655
Just gonna go back
to Garrett's.

51:57.690 --> 51:59.488
She's there, I know it.

51:59.523 --> 52:02.919
Can I please just keep this
in the safe for one night?

52:06.898 --> 52:07.695
I want it out by morning.

52:07.730 --> 52:09.790
Okay.

52:09.826 --> 52:12.130
After this I'm done,
I promise.

52:31.720 --> 52:33.447
<i>GARRETT :</i>
<i>What the hell happened here?</i>

52:33.483 --> 52:34.916
<i>ZWICK :</i>
<i>I caught this one</i>
<i>with half her take</i>

52:34.951 --> 52:36.151
<i>stuffed in the bottom</i>
<i>of her purse.</i>

52:36.186 --> 52:37.925
<i>GARRETT :</i>
<i>So, you beat her half to death?</i>

52:37.961 --> 52:39.929
<i>ZWICK :</i>
<i>You want me</i>
<i>to protect your money or not?</i>

52:39.965 --> 52:42.199
<i>GARRETT :</i>
<i>Just not the face, Zwick.</i>
<i>Why do you keep doing this?</i>

52:42.234 --> 52:44.131
<i>She's worthless to me</i>
<i>for what, a month?</i>

52:44.167 --> 52:45.932
<i>That is coming out of your end.</i>

52:45.967 --> 52:47.371
<i>ZWICK :</i>
<i>Bullshit it's coming out</i>
<i>of my end--</i>

52:47.406 --> 52:48.470
<i>GARRETT :</i>
<i>I don't have time for this.</i>

52:48.505 --> 52:50.103
<i>Just take the girls back</i>
<i>to the development.</i>

52:50.138 --> 52:52.172
<i>ZWICK :</i>
<i>Perez and Jones will make sure</i>
<i>they get back alright.</i>

52:52.208 --> 52:54.108
<i>You and I, we're having a talk.</i>

52:54.143 --> 52:56.871
TANYA:
Garrett is nasty.

52:56.907 --> 52:59.014
But uh,
when he wants something done,

52:59.050 --> 53:00.776
it's usually one of those three.

53:00.811 --> 53:03.985
So, I couldn't go
to anyone else.

53:04.020 --> 53:07.049
Beth, can you help her?

53:08.892 --> 53:11.053
I'm gonna try.

53:19.804 --> 53:21.164
Hey Miller?

53:21.199 --> 53:22.871
Yo.

53:22.906 --> 53:24.367
You got a sec?

53:24.402 --> 53:25.639
Yeah, of course.

53:27.912 --> 53:29.339
Can I get you something?

53:29.374 --> 53:30.714
Beer, or water?

53:30.749 --> 53:31.715
Uh, I'm on duty.

53:31.750 --> 53:33.383
Thanks though.

53:35.014 --> 53:38.355
Hey, have you seen April at all
since you were released?

53:39.987 --> 53:40.821
No.

53:40.856 --> 53:42.716
No?

53:42.751 --> 53:44.018
Why is something wrong?

53:44.053 --> 53:47.564
Well, Tanya,
you remember Tanya, right?

53:47.599 --> 53:48.323
Yeah.

53:48.358 --> 53:49.331
Yeah.

53:49.366 --> 53:51.233
She lives across the street
from April.

53:51.269 --> 53:53.093
Thinks she saw something
the other night.

53:53.129 --> 53:56.540
So, I stopped by April's,
no one answered.

53:56.575 --> 53:57.871
So...

53:57.906 --> 53:59.876
Hm.

53:59.911 --> 54:02.236
I'm sure she's fine.

54:08.419 --> 54:09.780
You want to tell me
what really went down

54:09.815 --> 54:12.323
the day Perez
and Jones pulled you over?

54:14.090 --> 54:16.287
Exactly what you think.

54:16.322 --> 54:17.825
I was an idiot.

54:17.860 --> 54:22.029
I was driving around with a van
that says locksmith on the side.

54:22.064 --> 54:24.093
Miller, I know.

54:25.463 --> 54:26.903
You know what?

54:26.938 --> 54:29.604
I know they're dirty.

54:40.780 --> 54:44.081
The reason I fell in love
with you,

54:44.117 --> 54:47.490
it's because you do anything
for the people you care about.

54:48.392 --> 54:51.087
That's also the reason
I let you go.

54:53.432 --> 54:56.367
'Cause I know the way
your mind works, Miller.

54:57.893 --> 54:59.369
And I came here to tell you,

54:59.405 --> 55:01.939
that if you know anything
about what's going on,

55:01.974 --> 55:03.737
you gotta stay out of it.

55:05.072 --> 55:06.267
Okay.

55:06.302 --> 55:09.111
But I really don't know
what you're talking about.

55:09.146 --> 55:11.613
You gotta stay out of it.

55:12.816 --> 55:14.781
Promise.

55:15.621 --> 55:17.047
Okay.

55:20.416 --> 55:23.420
Oh uh, you taught Lindsay
how to pick my handcuffs?

55:23.456 --> 55:26.921
Uh, not directly.

55:26.956 --> 55:28.997
'Cause she's really good at it.

55:32.502 --> 55:35.065
Well, you've done a hell
of a job with her.

55:36.709 --> 55:37.933
You know,

55:37.968 --> 55:39.537
it's been nice seeing the two
of you

55:39.572 --> 55:40.778
spend some time together.

55:40.813 --> 55:42.479
She missed you.

55:50.713 --> 55:51.787
I'll see you.

55:51.822 --> 55:53.347
See ya.

56:26.717 --> 56:28.888
What's in the envelope?

56:28.924 --> 56:32.089
Just some narcotics stats
Stern wanted me to chase.

56:34.029 --> 56:35.492
Fisher?

56:54.111 --> 56:56.947
With this
and Tanya Saunders' testimony,

56:56.982 --> 56:58.781
we have enough to implicate
all of them.

56:58.817 --> 57:01.692
Tanya Saunders is a prostitute.

57:02.556 --> 57:03.455
Sir, with all due respect--

57:03.491 --> 57:07.056
Now you and I are gonna
investigate this.

57:07.092 --> 57:08.696
I'm gonna need to bring this
to State Police.

57:08.731 --> 57:11.392
I wanna be well-armed
for that conversation.

57:13.972 --> 57:15.163
In the meantime,

57:15.198 --> 57:18.968
we got a potential
missing person's case.

57:19.004 --> 57:21.571
Uh, can you find me
another witness,

57:21.606 --> 57:23.003
besides Tanya?

57:23.038 --> 57:24.072
I mean is there anyone else

57:24.108 --> 57:25.549
that might know something
about this

57:25.584 --> 57:29.143
that you can talk to
without kicking up any dust?

57:29.178 --> 57:31.755
Let me give it some thought,
sir.

57:31.790 --> 57:33.491
Okay.

57:38.457 --> 57:39.290
Uh, Beth?

57:39.325 --> 57:40.086
Yeah?

57:40.122 --> 57:42.225
Thanks for bringing this to me.

57:42.261 --> 57:44.266
We have a lot of cops
on the other side of that door

57:44.302 --> 57:45.632
who will not feel the same way.

57:45.668 --> 57:48.000
You understand what I'm trying
to say?

58:47.623 --> 58:54.572
Well, the cat burglar returns
to the scene of the crime.

58:55.737 --> 58:59.676
You're not big on doorbells,
huh?

58:59.711 --> 59:03.545
You've got some meaty balls
for a coward in a mask.

59:03.580 --> 59:06.175
Why don't you take
that thing off

59:06.210 --> 59:07.475
and tell me
where my fucking money is?

59:07.510 --> 59:09.917
If you let her go,
I'll make sure you get it back.

59:13.221 --> 59:13.980
Drink?

59:14.016 --> 59:16.025
I said let her go.

59:16.061 --> 59:17.959
I heard you.

59:17.994 --> 59:21.130
I just have no fucking idea
what you're talking about.

59:21.166 --> 59:23.032
Where's my money?

59:23.068 --> 59:24.034
April Reyes.

59:24.070 --> 59:25.135
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

59:25.170 --> 59:28.067
Easy, we're talking.

59:29.240 --> 59:31.070
Help me understand.

59:31.105 --> 59:33.410
Obviously, you've realized
you're over your head.

59:33.445 --> 59:35.371
And you want to give me
my money back.

59:37.380 --> 59:38.907
Where does April fit in?

59:38.942 --> 59:40.377
I know you have her.

59:40.413 --> 59:43.984
I came here to make a trade,
but I'm running out of patience.

59:45.154 --> 59:46.750
Alright.

59:46.785 --> 59:49.217
Money for April Reyes?

59:49.253 --> 59:51.788
The girl you used
as a human shield?

59:51.823 --> 59:53.260
I can make that deal.

1:00:30.368 --> 1:00:31.793
I don't-- I don't have her!

1:00:38.704 --> 1:00:39.504
Where is she?

1:00:39.539 --> 1:00:40.375
Please...

1:00:40.410 --> 1:00:43.142
I don't-- I don't know.

1:00:49.685 --> 1:00:51.981
Stop it.
I was fucking lying.

1:00:52.016 --> 1:00:53.387
I was-- I was just stalling.

1:00:53.423 --> 1:00:54.322
I don't have her.

1:00:54.357 --> 1:00:56.984
Then who does?

1:00:57.019 --> 1:00:58.260
I don't know.

1:01:09.865 --> 1:01:11.436
Zwick!

1:01:11.471 --> 1:01:12.371
Zwick!

1:01:15.306 --> 1:01:17.438
I told him to get
to the bottom of this.

1:01:17.474 --> 1:01:20.982
If she's a part of it,
he probably has her.

1:01:45.243 --> 1:01:46.968
That's your cue.

1:02:02.887 --> 1:02:05.389
Fuck, Zwick!

1:02:05.424 --> 1:02:08.222
Doesn't anybody use
the goddamn doorbell anymore?

1:02:08.258 --> 1:02:10.257
What the hell happened to you?

1:02:10.292 --> 1:02:12.735
The guy who hit the game.

1:02:12.770 --> 1:02:14.403
The fucking psycho actually
came back,

1:02:14.438 --> 1:02:16.062
was asking about...

1:02:16.098 --> 1:02:17.163
April Reyes.

1:02:17.199 --> 1:02:18.041
You believe that?

1:02:18.076 --> 1:02:19.707
Oh yeah.

1:02:19.742 --> 1:02:22.309
You uh,
get a good look at him?

1:02:22.344 --> 1:02:24.340
Oh yeah.

1:02:24.376 --> 1:02:27.881
Some piece of shit locksmith
did a job for me

1:02:27.916 --> 1:02:30.254
over the Heavenly Arches
Development.

1:02:30.289 --> 1:02:32.185
Yeah, Miller Graham.

1:02:34.590 --> 1:02:37.124
What's with the gloves?

1:02:45.337 --> 1:02:47.902
What the fuck is this?

1:02:47.938 --> 1:02:50.866
You know it never really made
sense to me.

1:02:50.901 --> 1:02:52.574
In a way.

1:02:52.609 --> 1:02:55.103
Why am I working for you?

1:02:55.138 --> 1:02:57.105
Is this about money?

1:02:57.140 --> 1:02:58.576
I'll get you more money.

1:02:58.611 --> 1:03:00.547
Eh.

1:03:00.582 --> 1:03:02.450
I want it all.

1:03:02.485 --> 1:03:06.280
Ian, buddy...

1:03:06.315 --> 1:03:08.254
That's not very reasonable.

1:03:09.490 --> 1:03:11.323
I know.

1:03:28.637 --> 1:03:31.475
I thought you were looking
for April.

1:03:32.210 --> 1:03:33.383
What the hell happened to you?

1:03:33.418 --> 1:03:35.111
He didn't have her.

1:03:35.146 --> 1:03:37.010
But I think I know who does.

1:03:37.045 --> 1:03:38.455
Zwick.

1:03:38.490 --> 1:03:41.314
No, it's time to go to Beth.

1:03:41.349 --> 1:03:42.451
Just give her the money

1:03:42.487 --> 1:03:45.157
and hopefully she can get you
out of this.

1:03:45.192 --> 1:03:47.088
I don't think April has
that kind of time.

1:03:47.123 --> 1:03:48.497
FRANK:
Miller.

1:03:48.532 --> 1:03:50.632
We tried it your way.

1:03:50.667 --> 1:03:52.500
Your way made things worse.

1:03:52.535 --> 1:03:54.167
I know it did.

1:03:54.203 --> 1:03:56.472
But if Beth gets any closer
to Zwick on this,

1:03:56.507 --> 1:03:58.266
he's gonna kill her.

1:03:58.302 --> 1:04:00.471
We know what he's capable of.

1:04:02.579 --> 1:04:04.145
I just need to think.

1:04:12.723 --> 1:04:15.358
I think someone decided for you.

1:04:39.551 --> 1:04:40.682
You sure it's here, man?

1:04:40.718 --> 1:04:42.050
Maybe he took it home with him.

1:04:42.085 --> 1:04:44.317
No, it's here.
I'd seen him put it in the desk.

1:04:46.692 --> 1:04:47.986
He's gonna know
it was us, Hector.

1:04:48.021 --> 1:04:48.886
PEREZ:
It's alright, man.

1:04:48.921 --> 1:04:49.850
We need answers.

1:04:56.025 --> 1:05:00.228
Let's go see what that snitch
was so eager to show Stern.

1:05:00.263 --> 1:05:03.670
And this one right here.

1:05:03.706 --> 1:05:05.234
You're very good.

1:05:05.270 --> 1:05:08.402
I'll move my little horsey...

1:05:08.438 --> 1:05:11.278
Gallop, gallop, gallop, boof.

1:05:12.483 --> 1:05:13.849
She needed help.

1:05:13.884 --> 1:05:15.376
So, you helped her
with a robbery?

1:05:15.411 --> 1:05:16.344
They were gonna kill her.

1:05:16.379 --> 1:05:17.545
They probably already have.

1:05:17.580 --> 1:05:19.281
Look, I have evidence on all
of them.

1:05:19.316 --> 1:05:20.680
I can take this to the DA,

1:05:20.716 --> 1:05:21.724
but I need you
to tell me everything.

1:05:21.760 --> 1:05:23.160
And I need you to go
on record.

1:05:23.195 --> 1:05:24.261
No.

1:05:24.296 --> 1:05:25.721
Bad idea.

1:05:25.757 --> 1:05:28.090
Garrett could have half
the department in his pocket.

1:05:28.125 --> 1:05:29.091
Stern's clean.

1:05:29.126 --> 1:05:30.698
Please tell me you
didn't tell him anything.

1:05:30.733 --> 1:05:32.929
Of course, I told him.

1:05:32.964 --> 1:05:34.500
Oh, no...

1:05:34.536 --> 1:05:36.537
Well, then you gotta go to him
and convince him to drop it.

1:05:36.572 --> 1:05:37.698
Oh, what?

1:05:37.733 --> 1:05:39.601
So, you can keep taking care
of things?

1:05:39.636 --> 1:05:41.269
'Cause that's working out
real well.

1:05:41.304 --> 1:05:42.543
No, Miller, fuck it!

1:05:42.579 --> 1:05:44.280
You're out!

1:05:48.278 --> 1:05:50.018
Beth, that night.

1:05:50.053 --> 1:05:52.753
The reason why I had
to take the deal.

1:05:52.788 --> 1:05:54.547
Zwick planted that gun.

1:05:54.582 --> 1:05:56.217
What are you talking about?

1:05:56.253 --> 1:05:57.484
He murdered Kevin.

1:05:57.519 --> 1:05:59.722
I swear to God it's true.

1:06:01.125 --> 1:06:02.223
Did April know?

1:06:02.258 --> 1:06:03.224
MILLER:
No.

1:06:03.260 --> 1:06:05.398
Just me and Frank.

1:06:05.434 --> 1:06:08.263
And I couldn't tell you,
because you guys were in danger.

1:06:08.298 --> 1:06:10.966
Zwick made threats.

1:06:11.001 --> 1:06:12.471
Okay.

1:06:13.677 --> 1:06:15.876
You gotta trust me.

1:06:15.911 --> 1:06:18.281
Do you still have the money?

1:06:18.316 --> 1:06:19.449
Yeah.

1:06:19.484 --> 1:06:20.308
BETH:
Okay.

1:06:20.343 --> 1:06:21.610
It's material evidence.

1:06:21.645 --> 1:06:25.048
I can take it directly
to Stern tonight.

1:06:25.083 --> 1:06:26.286
If I cooperate,

1:06:26.321 --> 1:06:28.491
there's a lot that's gonna
come out about me.

1:06:28.527 --> 1:06:30.917
It's the only way.

1:06:30.952 --> 1:06:33.956
If you help us,
maybe we can work something out.

1:06:33.991 --> 1:06:35.830
Yeah.

1:06:35.866 --> 1:06:37.630
<i>LINSAY:</i>

Hey, we could be a duet.

1:06:58.816 --> 1:06:59.982
Yeah.
That'd be good.

1:07:00.017 --> 1:07:00.721
Okay.

1:07:00.756 --> 1:07:01.650
It's your move.

1:07:01.685 --> 1:07:04.518
You've always had a way
with her, Frank.

1:07:04.553 --> 1:07:06.630
Even when she was a baby.

1:07:06.665 --> 1:07:09.322
Well, yeah, she's family.

1:07:09.358 --> 1:07:11.101
So are you.

1:07:13.595 --> 1:07:16.972
You be careful out there.

1:07:17.007 --> 1:07:19.168
You keep an eye
on my little girl.

1:07:59.879 --> 1:08:00.745
Hey.

1:08:00.780 --> 1:08:02.241
<i>ZWICK :</i>
<i>Yeah, it's done.</i>

1:08:02.277 --> 1:08:04.416

anonymous tip to the station

1:08:04.451 --> 1:08:06.354
about a disturbance

1:08:07.790 --> 1:08:09.050
Listen to me!

1:08:09.086 --> 1:08:11.986
You two need to figure out a
way to plant that gun on Miller

1:08:12.021 --> 1:08:13.895
and get the money
before homicide brings him in.

1:08:13.931 --> 1:08:15.697
Didn't see my texts, did you?

1:08:15.733 --> 1:08:17.398
I didn't see what?

1:08:20.738 --> 1:08:21.903
What the fuck are these?

1:08:21.938 --> 1:08:23.630
Fisher gave 'em to Stern.

1:08:23.665 --> 1:08:24.836
There-- there's audio, too.

1:08:24.871 --> 1:08:27.607
Listen.

1:08:27.642 --> 1:08:29.369
<i>GARRETT :</i>
<i>What the hell happened here?</i>

1:08:29.405 --> 1:08:30.739

<i>Just not the face, Zwick.</i>
<i>Why do you keep doing this?</i>

1:08:37.882 --> 1:08:38.722

Alright!

1:08:40.150 --> 1:08:41.356
Enough!

1:08:42.650 --> 1:08:44.584
Stern heard this, too?

1:08:44.620 --> 1:08:46.728
<i>JONES :</i>
<i>It was on a drive that</i>
<i>we pulled from his desk drawe.</i>

1:08:46.763 --> 1:08:49.257
Motherfucker!

1:08:49.293 --> 1:08:51.531
Goddamn it!

1:08:54.799 --> 1:08:57.372
That snake Garrett was
cooperating with Fisher.

1:08:57.408 --> 1:09:01.736
I told you we should have
taken him out months ago!

1:09:01.771 --> 1:09:02.779
<i>JONES :</i>
<i>What do we do?</i>

1:09:02.814 --> 1:09:03.738
Well, if Stern's heard this,

1:09:03.774 --> 1:09:05.347
so it's a little too late,
isn't it?

1:09:06.781 --> 1:09:07.841
Okay.

1:09:07.877 --> 1:09:10.279
So, uh, you two get over
to Frank's shop.

1:09:10.314 --> 1:09:11.485
Grab the cash.

1:09:11.521 --> 1:09:13.481
Kill Miller if you have to,
but I don't give a fuck.

1:09:13.516 --> 1:09:14.483
Kill anybody, alright.

1:09:14.518 --> 1:09:18.695
Just grab the fucking money.

1:09:18.730 --> 1:09:20.328
We're gonna need it.

1:09:20.364 --> 1:09:23.123
Meet back here at the motel
when you're done.

1:09:24.268 --> 1:09:25.801
You said that after we took
care of Garrett,

1:09:25.836 --> 1:09:26.803
the money was mine.

1:09:26.838 --> 1:09:29.096
Yeah, well, plans change.

1:09:29.131 --> 1:09:30.966

as a fucking dollar,

1:11:25.783 --> 1:11:26.615
you better hope she brings
it back.

1:11:26.651 --> 1:11:28.054
Please, man.
I'm begging you.

1:11:28.089 --> 1:11:29.022
I'm begging you.

1:11:32.058 --> 1:11:32.793
Lindsay!

1:11:32.828 --> 1:11:33.629
Lindsay!

1:11:33.664 --> 1:11:35.255
Lindsay!

1:11:52.617 --> 1:11:53.449
Frank!

1:11:56.954 --> 1:11:58.921
Frank, you still here?

1:12:17.372 --> 1:12:19.408
-Beth, they took her.
-No!

1:12:19.443 --> 1:12:21.008
-But we're gonna get her back!
-No, no, no, no.

1:12:21.043 --> 1:12:22.912
No, no, no...

1:12:22.947 --> 1:12:23.813
Whose blood is that?

1:12:23.848 --> 1:12:24.439
It's Frank's,

1:12:24.474 --> 1:12:25.241
He's dead.

1:12:25.276 --> 1:12:26.441
Frank?

1:12:26.476 --> 1:12:27.313
He's dead?

1:12:27.349 --> 1:12:28.313
How could you let this happen?

1:12:28.348 --> 1:12:29.247
It's April's fault.

1:12:29.282 --> 1:12:30.952
She's working with them
and they took her.

1:12:30.987 --> 1:12:31.713
No.

1:12:31.748 --> 1:12:32.982
All they want is the money.

1:12:33.018 --> 1:12:34.347
We get the money to them,
they'll let her go.

1:12:37.691 --> 1:12:39.019
<i>ZWICK :</i>
<i>You got my money?</i>

1:12:39.054 --> 1:12:39.896
<i>MILLER :</i>
<i>I have it.</i>

1:12:39.931 --> 1:12:41.022
<i>Where do I meet you?</i>

1:12:41.057 --> 1:12:44.460
Abandoned stone yard
off Lohman Avenue.

1:12:44.496 --> 1:12:46.661
You can't miss it.

1:12:46.696 --> 1:12:48.262
You can't afford to.

1:12:51.734 --> 1:12:52.709
We're gonna get her.

1:12:52.744 --> 1:12:53.610
Oh my God.

1:12:53.645 --> 1:12:54.675
I promise you,
we're gonna get her back.

1:13:14.194 --> 1:13:16.163
Handcuffs?

1:13:16.198 --> 1:13:17.459
That's a nice touch.

1:13:17.494 --> 1:13:18.991
She's 12.

1:13:19.026 --> 1:13:21.130
Yeah, well, you never know.

1:13:22.973 --> 1:13:25.332
Wait, Jones?

1:13:31.841 --> 1:13:34.081
Got you a little present.

1:14:06.050 --> 1:14:07.915
Where are you going?

1:14:07.950 --> 1:14:09.752
Huh?

1:14:09.787 --> 1:14:10.652
Hey!

1:14:15.191 --> 1:14:17.190
What the fuck is this?

1:14:17.226 --> 1:14:18.050
She's just a kid.

1:14:18.086 --> 1:14:20.228
This was never part of the plan.

1:14:20.263 --> 1:14:21.095
You want to get out of here?

1:14:21.131 --> 1:14:23.159
We need leverage.

1:14:24.167 --> 1:14:25.760
God, you make me sick.

1:14:25.795 --> 1:14:27.094
Oh, don't be so naive.

1:14:27.130 --> 1:14:29.506
You knew what
you were getting into.

1:14:56.265 --> 1:14:58.029
I'm going for a smoke.

1:15:19.146 --> 1:15:21.151
MILLER:
Hey, look at this.

1:15:23.854 --> 1:15:25.518
BETH:
Day's End Motel.

1:15:25.554 --> 1:15:27.929
That's down the street
from where you're meeting Zwick.

1:15:27.964 --> 1:15:28.658
Alright.

1:15:28.693 --> 1:15:29.762
So, you go get Lindsay.

1:15:29.797 --> 1:15:31.592
I'll try to stall Zwick
as long as I can.

1:15:31.627 --> 1:15:32.459
No.

1:15:32.495 --> 1:15:33.531
April is the one who got
Lindsay taken

1:15:33.566 --> 1:15:34.334
in the first place.

1:15:34.369 --> 1:15:35.664
We can't trust her.

1:15:35.700 --> 1:15:37.132
She was after me.

1:15:37.167 --> 1:15:39.037
She didn't even know
Lindsay was there.

1:15:41.578 --> 1:15:44.339
Zwick has no reason
to keep you alive.

1:15:45.616 --> 1:15:48.541
If you can save Lindsay,
it's all that matters.

1:15:57.355 --> 1:15:59.992
You haven't heard anything
about that bomb, have you?

1:16:02.559 --> 1:16:04.459
<i>ACTRESS ON TV:</i>

1:16:08.737 --> 1:16:11.063

1:16:14.168 --> 1:16:16.903
<i>Well, this case is over.</i>

1:16:56.781 --> 1:16:58.382
Easy now, Miller.

1:16:58.417 --> 1:16:59.078
Easy.

1:16:59.113 --> 1:17:00.221
Where's my daughter?

1:17:00.256 --> 1:17:01.147
ZWICK:
Nearby.

1:17:01.182 --> 1:17:03.054
Don't do anything stupid.

1:17:03.089 --> 1:17:05.851
You hand her over to me,
and the money's yours.

1:17:05.886 --> 1:17:06.859
Yeah.

1:17:06.894 --> 1:17:08.087
I think you got your order
of operations

1:17:08.122 --> 1:17:09.457
all fucked up there.

1:17:11.800 --> 1:17:15.103

kill me?

April?

1:17:54.473 --> 1:17:55.305
Zwick?

1:18:00.611 --> 1:18:01.116
Come on.

1:18:01.151 --> 1:18:02.184
Let's go.

1:18:02.219 --> 1:18:04.285
Get the money.

1:18:04.320 --> 1:18:04.813
It's in here.

1:18:04.849 --> 1:18:06.316
Well, get it out.

1:18:08.718 --> 1:18:09.290
Come on.

1:18:09.325 --> 1:18:10.423
Quit stalling.

1:18:10.458 --> 1:18:11.483
One phone call,

1:18:11.519 --> 1:18:12.458

about your little girl

1:18:12.494 --> 1:18:13.659

1:18:19.828 --> 1:18:21.698
April!

1:18:21.733 --> 1:18:22.997
Where you at?

1:18:29.344 --> 1:18:30.202
Let's go.

1:18:30.237 --> 1:18:31.644
Throw the gun over here.

1:18:31.680 --> 1:18:32.678
You think I'm a fucking idiot?

1:18:32.714 --> 1:18:34.341
I think you're out of options.

1:18:34.376 --> 1:18:36.010
I think we're both out
of options.

1:18:36.045 --> 1:18:37.082

1:18:37.118 --> 1:18:40.114
I will make this phone call
right fucking now.

1:18:40.149 --> 1:18:41.923
Throw that gun over here.

1:18:44.094 --> 1:18:45.861
Okay.

1:18:54.898 --> 1:18:55.730
There you go.

1:18:55.765 --> 1:18:57.205
Finally.

1:18:57.241 --> 1:18:57.899
No, no, no.

Kid, stop!

1:19:46.289 --> 1:19:47.714
Come back!

1:19:49.819 --> 1:19:50.885
Lindsay!

1:19:50.920 --> 1:19:51.690
Come here.

1:19:51.726 --> 1:19:53.429
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1:19:53.464 --> 1:19:54.360
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

1:19:54.395 --> 1:19:55.561
Okay.

1:19:55.597 --> 1:19:56.958
Stay close to me.

1:19:56.994 --> 1:19:58.359
Yeah, super tight.

1:19:58.395 --> 1:20:00.236
Now, I need you
to sit down here, baby.

1:20:00.271 --> 1:20:01.127
Close your eyes.

1:20:01.162 --> 1:20:01.962
Close your eyes.

1:20:10.172 --> 1:20:12.271
Lindsay, stand up, baby.

1:20:12.306 --> 1:20:13.414
Okay, come with me.

1:20:13.450 --> 1:20:14.545
You see that car?

1:20:14.580 --> 1:20:14.974
Yeah.

1:20:15.009 --> 1:20:15.708
Okay.

1:20:15.744 --> 1:20:16.712
-We need to get into it.
-Okay.

1:20:16.747 --> 1:20:18.184
Okay?

1:20:24.493 --> 1:20:25.592
Get down, baby.

1:20:25.627 --> 1:20:26.956
Where are we going, mom?

1:20:26.991 --> 1:20:28.491
To save your father.

1:20:42.845 --> 1:20:46.344
How'd you convince April
to do this?

1:20:48.979 --> 1:20:51.848
Ah, Miller.

1:20:51.883 --> 1:20:54.521
It was her idea.

1:20:54.556 --> 1:20:57.416
You're lying.

1:20:57.451 --> 1:20:58.991
Why would she work with you?

1:20:59.027 --> 1:21:03.596
Well, we do have one thing
in common.

1:21:03.632 --> 1:21:05.165
We both hate you.

1:21:07.235 --> 1:21:10.297
Lock the doors behind me
and don't let anyone in here

1:21:10.332 --> 1:21:11.833
either than me or your dad.

1:21:11.868 --> 1:21:13.309
Okay?

1:21:30.419 --> 1:21:32.284
And then faking her kidnapping.

1:21:32.320 --> 1:21:33.054
Ah, there you go.

1:21:33.089 --> 1:21:34.486
That was genius.

1:21:34.521 --> 1:21:37.191
Led you straight to Garrett.

1:21:37.226 --> 1:21:39.529
Oh, you haven't heard?

1:21:43.605 --> 1:21:46.573
Garrett's dead.

1:21:46.608 --> 1:21:48.703
You killed him.

1:21:55.585 --> 1:21:57.751
That's right Miller.

1:21:57.787 --> 1:22:01.413
She would keep all that money.

1:22:01.448 --> 1:22:03.784
And I will take over.

1:22:04.626 --> 1:22:07.088
But here we are.

1:22:28.512 --> 1:22:32.277
I never believed
what you said about Kevin.

1:22:32.313 --> 1:22:35.649
But April...

1:22:35.685 --> 1:22:37.785
My brother wouldn't
pull a gun on anyone.

1:22:40.121 --> 1:22:43.131
No.

1:22:46.327 --> 1:22:47.896
Jesus Christ.

1:22:47.931 --> 1:22:49.830
April.

1:22:52.400 --> 1:22:55.710
I thought that you...

1:22:55.745 --> 1:22:57.475
You thought what, Miller?

1:22:59.016 --> 1:23:00.574
Zwick might have pulled
the trigger that night,

1:23:00.610 --> 1:23:01.583
but Kevin never would
have been there

1:23:01.618 --> 1:23:03.184
if it weren't for you.

1:23:08.823 --> 1:23:11.894
And now you get to walk?

1:23:11.929 --> 1:23:15.891
You get to start over
and have a family.

1:23:15.926 --> 1:23:17.523
Come on.

1:23:17.558 --> 1:23:19.094
You don't have to do this.

1:23:19.130 --> 1:23:23.704
I want to do this.

1:23:23.739 --> 1:23:25.599
You and the monster

1:23:25.635 --> 1:23:26.806
that murdered my brother
kill each other

1:23:26.841 --> 1:23:29.512
in a pile of rocks.

1:23:29.547 --> 1:23:30.871
That's what happens.

1:23:32.109 --> 1:23:34.380
BETH:
April!

1:23:35.212 --> 1:23:37.548
Put the gun down.

1:23:38.313 --> 1:23:40.122
Put it down.

1:23:42.385 --> 1:23:45.694
You helped us find Lindsay.

1:23:45.729 --> 1:23:47.987
You've done a good thing.

1:23:48.828 --> 1:23:49.660
I'm sorry.

1:23:49.696 --> 1:23:51.366
I never meant
to get Lindsay involved.

1:23:51.401 --> 1:23:52.426
I know.

1:23:52.462 --> 1:23:54.529
MILLER:
April, you're right.

1:23:54.564 --> 1:23:57.363
I did get Kevin killed
that night.

1:23:57.398 --> 1:23:58.866
It was my fault.

1:23:58.901 --> 1:24:03.502
And I thought about it everyday
for the last 10 years.

1:24:03.537 --> 1:24:05.576
He was my best friend.

1:24:07.576 --> 1:24:09.617
I can't change what happened.

1:24:09.652 --> 1:24:11.183
I wish I could.

1:24:11.218 --> 1:24:15.722
And I know
I fucked everything up.

1:24:15.757 --> 1:24:17.658
Including you.

1:24:17.693 --> 1:24:19.361
And I'm sorry.

1:25:44.981 --> 1:25:47.407
SHARON:
Two jobs, Mr. Graham.

1:25:47.442 --> 1:25:49.710
I'm impressed.

1:25:49.745 --> 1:25:52.119
Your employers speak highly
of you.

1:25:52.154 --> 1:25:54.787
Gotta get that
college fund started.

1:25:54.823 --> 1:25:56.687
How is she?

1:25:59.921 --> 1:26:04.158
There's uh, good days
and bad days.

1:26:04.193 --> 1:26:05.833
Mhmmm.

1:26:05.868 --> 1:26:08.727
It's gonna take time.

1:26:08.762 --> 1:26:11.673
But she's gonna be alright.

1:26:11.708 --> 1:26:14.601
Yeah, I hope so.

1:26:14.636 --> 1:26:16.707
STERN:
Detective Fisher.

1:26:20.715 --> 1:26:21.777
Chief?

1:26:21.813 --> 1:26:22.842
Well, there'll be more pomp
and circumstance,

1:26:22.877 --> 1:26:26.046
but figured
I should tell you now.

1:26:32.753 --> 1:26:35.462
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

1:26:37.326 --> 1:26:39.866
Thank you.
