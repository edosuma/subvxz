00:06.840 --> 00:10.469
Wakey, wakey,
two days till my birthday cakey.

00:10.577 --> 00:13.546
Sleepy, sleepy,
please shut up-y.

00:13.646 --> 00:15.910
- Did you get me a present yet?
- Randy.

00:16.015 --> 00:18.951
Randy. Yeah, I'm glad
you brought that up.

00:19.052 --> 00:22.385
Since I'm gonna be a little older
in a few days...

00:22.489 --> 00:25.049
I'd like you to start callin' me
by my proper name- Randolph.

00:25.158 --> 00:28.821
- Your name's Randall.
- It is?

00:28.928 --> 00:30.896
Is that even a real name?

00:30.997 --> 00:35.229
I mean, Randolph's a name
I've actually heard before...

00:35.335 --> 00:38.065
like Randolph Hitler.

00:38.171 --> 00:40.139
Randall sounds so weird.

00:40.240 --> 00:43.732
I mean, Mom and Dad might as well
have named me Pork Chop-

00:43.843 --> 00:45.811
Pork Chop Hickey.

00:45.912 --> 00:47.880
Hey, I kind of like that.

00:47.981 --> 00:50.279
- Earl, will you-
- No, I will not.

00:50.383 --> 00:53.910
I'll just make it
my birthday wish then.

00:54.020 --> 00:56.818
Randy, you can't say your wish,
or it won't come true.

00:56.923 --> 00:59.357
Damn it!

00:59.459 --> 01:01.427
Next year.

01:04.563 --> 01:06.759
Good mornin', Earl.

01:06.866 --> 01:09.596
Good mornin', Randy.

01:09.702 --> 01:12.262
<i>My name is Earl.</i>

01:15.675 --> 01:19.111
<i>[Earl Narrating] I'd put a lot of thought</i>
<i>into Randy's birthday present this year...</i>

01:19.212 --> 01:21.180
<i>and even though</i>
<i>it was two days early...</i>

01:21.281 --> 01:23.681
<i>it wasn't the kind of thing</i>
<i>I could hide in the closet.</i>

01:23.783 --> 01:27.116
- Nice ride, Earl.
- Thanks.

01:27.220 --> 01:29.916
- It's a birthday present for Randy.
- Wow.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.684
This is nicer than your car.

01:31.791 --> 01:35.352
I know he's your brother, but I'd like
to remind you that for my last birthday...

01:35.462 --> 01:37.930
you gave me a mug that said
"Happy bat mitzvah."

01:38.031 --> 01:40.625
I thought it meant
"Happy birthday" in Spanish.

01:40.733 --> 01:42.894
Besides, it's not
just a birthday gift.

01:43.002 --> 01:44.970
I'm crossin' somethin' off the list.

01:45.071 --> 01:49.167
Number 213- never let Randy
have anything better than me.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.766
<i>[Earl Narrating] Our whole lives,</i>
<i>whenever me and Randy got stuff...</i>

01:51.878 --> 01:54.472
<i>I always just took</i>
<i>the better thing for myself.</i>

01:57.717 --> 02:02.177
Randy, you'd look so cool
in this thing.

02:02.288 --> 02:05.189
- <i># You can't always trust a woman #</i>
- <i>Whether it was stuff we stole-</i>

02:05.291 --> 02:07.316
Men wear these?

02:07.427 --> 02:11.557
- <i># You can't always trust your best friend #</i>
- Mm-hmm.

02:11.664 --> 02:16.067
- <i>or girls.</i>
- Sorry, I'm saving myself for marriage.

02:16.169 --> 02:18.296
I'm not.

02:18.404 --> 02:20.497
Uh, this one's mine.

02:20.607 --> 02:22.700
Uhh-

02:22.809 --> 02:26.176
So, uh, do you want
to talk about the Lord?

02:26.279 --> 02:28.179
All right.

02:29.215 --> 02:31.342
<i>Even when we moved into the motel.</i>

02:33.620 --> 02:37.920
Bad news, Randy.
Your side's got a big bloodstain on it.

02:41.094 --> 02:45.588
Randy deserves to finally get somethin' better
than me, and he's always loved Rancheros.

02:45.698 --> 02:49.031
They're his favorite
kind of car- and eggs.

02:49.135 --> 02:51.103
<i>## [Blues: Man Singing, Indistinct]</i>

02:55.575 --> 02:57.543
- Hey, Randy-
- Not now.

02:57.644 --> 03:00.169
It's "Catch Your Own Lunch" Day.
He's pickin' himself an entrï¿½e.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.214
I bet this was more fun
when they were alive.

03:02.315 --> 03:04.943
It's not my fault.
The water heats up under the lights.

03:05.051 --> 03:08.418
The good news is you can eat the crab
right out of the prize slot.

03:08.521 --> 03:13.015
I know it's two days early, but I got you
a birthday present- really cool one.

03:13.126 --> 03:17.790
So, a parkin' space.
What made you think of that?

03:17.897 --> 03:20.127
Well, uh, I know how you're
always jealous of handicapped people...

03:20.233 --> 03:22.133
'cause they get their own spots.

03:22.235 --> 03:24.465
I can't believe someone stole it.

03:24.571 --> 03:27.665
<i>[Earl Narrating] There was a reason I was</i>
<i>so surprised my car had been stolen.</i>

03:27.774 --> 03:30.436
<i>In Camden County,</i>
<i>there were only two rules:</i>

03:30.543 --> 03:33.603
<i>Never snitch, and crooks</i>
<i>don't steal from other crooks.</i>

03:36.583 --> 03:39.416
- Earl?
- [Groans]

03:39.519 --> 03:41.783
Earl!

03:41.888 --> 03:44.823
Creepy Rodney?
What the hell, man?

03:44.924 --> 03:47.722
I'm sorry, buddy.
I didn't know it was you.

03:47.827 --> 03:50.318
- Man, I'm a jerk.
- No biggie.

03:50.430 --> 03:53.126
When'd you start
workin' with the rock?

03:53.233 --> 03:56.066
- What happened to your knife?
- Rocks are misdemeanors.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.399
Good to know.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.402
Come on, Joy.

04:00.506 --> 04:03.168
I just want to know who's been
stealin' cars around town.

04:03.276 --> 04:06.370
I'll tell you who's not stealin' cars-
that dipstick who carjacked me.

04:06.479 --> 04:08.379
Found him sleepin' in the Brat.

04:08.481 --> 04:11.473
Beat the snot out of him with that
Razor scooter I'd been ridin' around on.

04:11.584 --> 04:15.645
Long story short, got the Brat back,
but the Razor scooter pulls to the left.

04:15.755 --> 04:19.623
Look, I don't need to know who's <i>not</i>
rippin' off cars. I need to know who is.

04:19.726 --> 04:22.490
Crap! Stole my bait.
Fish are too damned smart.

04:22.595 --> 04:25.530
I'm gonna have to dumb 'em down.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.595
Babe, you're underminin'
the spirit of the game.

04:29.702 --> 04:33.160
This ain't the Olympics, Darnell.
It's a freakin' buffet.

04:33.273 --> 04:37.767
Look, Earl, you were smart to come to me.
I am excellent at solvin' mysteries.

04:37.877 --> 04:43.008
Forty-five minutes into <i>CSI,</i> I always know
what happened. So give me a little more info.

04:43.116 --> 04:47.212
- The car was just stolen from
the parking lot five minutes ago.
- Was it a stick shift?

04:47.320 --> 04:51.347
- No, automatic.
- Hmm. On the column or on the floor?

04:51.457 --> 04:55.393
- Column. Why?
- You're looking for Clyde Fowler
and his little buddy Bed Bug.

04:55.495 --> 04:58.225
H-How can you possibly know that?

04:58.331 --> 05:01.892
Clyde and Bed Bug were in here this morning,
sayin' they were lookin' to steal a car.

05:02.001 --> 05:04.060
Damn it, Darnell!
I was mind-freakin' him!

05:05.938 --> 05:08.099
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>I went way back with Clyde and Bed Bug.</i>

05:08.207 --> 05:11.973
<i>I knew 'em when they werejust Clyde</i>
<i>and Clyde's friend from out of town.</i>

05:13.246 --> 05:16.647
Earl Hickey.
Well, this is a blast from the past.

05:16.749 --> 05:19.217
Hey, how's that hot wife of yours?

05:19.319 --> 05:22.755
Didn't she run off with some black dude,
but you didn't do nothin'...

05:22.855 --> 05:25.085
because you found Jesus
or his grocery list or somethin'?

05:25.191 --> 05:27.659
<i>I made a list of all the things</i>
<i>I've done wrong.</i>

05:27.760 --> 05:31.059
Was number one lettin' some black dude
steal your woman? [Laughing]

05:31.164 --> 05:33.962
Yeah.
So, uh, anyway, fellas...

05:34.067 --> 05:37.559
the reason I stopped by
is that Ranchero there.

05:37.670 --> 05:41.003
- Ain't she a beauty?
- She sure is.

05:41.107 --> 05:43.701
Here's the thing.
The car is mine.

05:45.445 --> 05:47.037
- You're kiddin' me.
- Sorry.

05:47.146 --> 05:50.513
I hate to bring you down off
what I'm sure was a real good stealin' high...

05:50.616 --> 05:55.644
but I should probably just, you know,
take the car and get goin'.

05:55.755 --> 05:58.451
Well, now-now-now, look.
L- I hate to bring you down...

05:58.558 --> 06:03.427
from what must be a real good
"I found my car" high, but- [Clears Throat]

06:03.529 --> 06:05.463
You're not gettin'
that Ranchero back.

06:05.565 --> 06:08.295
What are you talkin' about, Clyde?
It's me.

06:08.401 --> 06:12.201
- Guys like us have a rule.
- But you ain't guys like us no more.

06:12.305 --> 06:15.968
<i>You see, chief, nowadays</i>
<i>you fall more in the, uh...</i>

06:16.075 --> 06:19.533
civilian/victim
column of the ledger.

06:19.645 --> 06:22.671
<i>Look, I don't know what a ledger is,</i>
<i>but I've paid my dues.</i>

06:22.782 --> 06:25.444
And I'll be damned if you two losers
are gonna keep my car!

06:25.551 --> 06:29.647
- [Barks, Growls]
- Well, I don't think Dubya likes your tone, Earl.

06:29.756 --> 06:33.590
But we're reasonable people.

06:33.693 --> 06:35.752
You can have the car back.

06:35.862 --> 06:38.763
- For $1,500.
- [Laughing]

06:38.865 --> 06:40.924
Hell, no!
I'm not buyin' it back.

06:41.033 --> 06:43.160
We're takin' this problem
to Mr. Wallace.

06:43.269 --> 06:45.071
<i>[Earl Narrating] Mr. Wallace was Camden's</i>
<i>oldest, toughest and most respected criminal.</i>

06:45.071 --> 06:47.437
<i>[Earl Narrating] Mr. Wallace was Camden's</i>
<i>oldest, toughest and most respected criminal.</i>

06:47.540 --> 06:51.169
<i>So when two crooks had a beef,</i>
<i>they went to him.</i>

06:51.277 --> 06:53.768
<i>He also worked part-time</i>
<i>as a crossing guard for the health insurance.</i>

06:53.880 --> 06:57.680
Hold it, boys, hold it.
I have a client.

06:59.118 --> 07:02.781
Okay, I've heard enough.
Earl, you are no longer one of us.

07:02.889 --> 07:05.756
You want the car back,
you'll have to pay.

07:05.858 --> 07:09.350
- Pay? That's bullcrap!
- Hey, watch your language there!

07:09.462 --> 07:13.228
<i>And if you ever come to me again</i>
<i>with a problem this small...</i>

07:13.332 --> 07:15.300
I will shoot you in the face...

07:15.401 --> 07:20.202
<i>and splatter your brains all over</i>
<i>this crosswalk and everybody in it.</i>

07:21.240 --> 07:23.674
But not on you, sweetheart.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.540
We wouldn't want to ruin
that pretty little dress. Hmm?

07:29.081 --> 07:31.675
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>As soon as I paid up and got the car back...</i>

07:31.784 --> 07:35.481
<i>I went straight over to the Crab Shack</i>
<i>to give Randy his present A.S.A.P.</i>

07:35.588 --> 07:40.321
<i>I decided I wasn't gonna let those two dirtbags</i>
<i>ruin what was gonna be a great birthday.</i>

07:40.426 --> 07:44.260
<i>Randy deserved this car,</i>
<i>no matter what thejudge said about his driving.</i>

07:44.363 --> 07:46.490
<i>Didn't matter</i>
<i>how much it cost me.</i>

07:46.599 --> 07:50.160
<i>The look on his face was gonna</i>
<i>make everything worth it.</i>

07:50.269 --> 07:52.567
Hmm.

07:52.672 --> 07:56.836
- <i>Uh, another parkin'space.</i>
- Son of a bitch.

07:56.943 --> 08:01.971
It's one thing not to be treated like
a fellow criminal, but stealin' my car twice?

08:02.081 --> 08:03.912
Now they're treatin' me like a punk.

08:04.016 --> 08:06.416
You are a punk,
sittin' here complainin' like a little bitch.

08:06.519 --> 08:08.919
The old Earl would just get drunk,
go steal a city bus...

08:09.021 --> 08:10.921
and drive it right
through their kitchen.

08:11.023 --> 08:14.481
<i>Of course, if you were the old Earl, they wouldn't</i>
<i>have stolen your car in the first place.</i>

08:14.594 --> 08:17.529
True dat.
Oh, what a tangled web we weave...

08:17.630 --> 08:20.098
when first we practice
to make a stupid-ass list.

08:20.199 --> 08:22.827
I hate to say it,
but if they're gonna treat me like a civilian...

08:22.935 --> 08:24.869
I might have to act like one.

08:24.971 --> 08:27.735
- <i>[Bell Dinging]</i>
- I might have to go to the police.

08:27.840 --> 08:31.332
Earl, you can't snitch.
You know the order.

08:31.444 --> 08:34.436
Regular people, fat people...

08:34.547 --> 08:36.447
cops, Al-Qaeda...

08:36.549 --> 08:38.448
stuff you squeeze out of a zit...

08:38.551 --> 08:40.451
and then snitches.

08:40.553 --> 08:44.250
Well, then I don't know what to do.
But I gotta get Randy's car back.

08:46.859 --> 08:50.693
When did you move fat people
above Al Qaeda and stuff inside a zit?

08:50.796 --> 08:54.232
Saw this thing on <i>Dateline</i>
about thyroids.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.528
Broke my heart.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.865
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>I was so mixed up, I went walkin'for hours.</i>

08:59.972 --> 09:02.805
<i>Before I knew it,</i>
<i>I was near the police station.</i>

09:02.909 --> 09:05.377
<i>But I still wasn't</i>
<i>prepared to go in.</i>

09:05.478 --> 09:07.810
<i>I had to work out</i>
<i>all the pros and minuses.</i>

09:07.914 --> 09:11.577
Joy might be right about the code,
but Clyde and Bed Bug said themselves...

09:11.684 --> 09:13.584
I'm not one of'em anymore.

09:13.686 --> 09:15.745
But snitches
are the lowest of the low.

09:15.855 --> 09:18.050
Do I want to be known as that?
No way.

09:18.157 --> 09:21.888
But why do I care what a bunch
of lowlifes think of me? I don't.

09:21.994 --> 09:25.760
Ah, I'm lyin'.
I do care.

09:25.865 --> 09:29.767
But Randy deserves that car,
and I'm gonna make sure he gets it.

09:29.869 --> 09:32.167
[Cooing]

09:32.271 --> 09:34.671
Thank you.

09:37.209 --> 09:41.077
<i>[Earl Narrating] In the end, the most</i>
<i>important thing was gettin'Randy's car back.</i>

09:41.180 --> 09:43.478
<i>So what choice did I have?</i>

09:43.583 --> 09:46.313
So you car's been stolen.
Man, that's the pits.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.751
Well, sit down.
We'll fill out some forms.

09:48.854 --> 09:52.688
By the way, there's coffee and a Bundt cake
in the break room if you're an emotional eater.

09:52.792 --> 09:55.352
Guilty as charged, Your Honor.
[Chuckles]

09:55.461 --> 09:59.192
Look, I was hopin' we could skip the forms,
and I'd just tell you who did this...

09:59.298 --> 10:03.325
off the record, just between us,
and... you can go get my car.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.461
You know who did it?
That's great.

10:05.571 --> 10:09.598
Findin' out who did it is the part
of this job that I hate. Who was it?

10:11.544 --> 10:13.512
Clyde Fowler and Bed Bug.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.309
Wow, Earl.
I never pegged you for a snitch.

10:16.415 --> 10:18.474
- I wasn't left with a lot of choices.
- <i>[Hand Thuds]</i>

10:18.584 --> 10:21.883
- Well, you know what snitches get.
- Their tongues cut out?

10:21.988 --> 10:24.183
No. You get to pick a prize
from our goody drawer.

10:24.290 --> 10:28.386
We got anything you could want in here.
We got candy, trinkets, novelties.

10:28.494 --> 10:33.830
- How about my self-respect?
- Sure. We got comic books,
pizza coupons, marijuana.

10:33.933 --> 10:36.197
That's not supposed to be in here.

10:36.302 --> 10:39.100
<i>[Earl Narrating] I walked around for a while</i>
<i>hatin'the fact that I snitched...</i>

10:39.205 --> 10:41.196
<i>but what was done was done.</i>

10:41.307 --> 10:44.538
<i>At least it was all over.</i>

10:51.450 --> 10:53.350
<i>Or maybe not.</i>

10:59.759 --> 11:04.093
I agree. It's probably got something
to do with you snitching.

11:04.196 --> 11:06.721
Ooh! Earl, there's a present
in the sink...

11:06.832 --> 11:09.323
from either a very large dog
or a very small man.

11:26.952 --> 11:31.184
Earl Hickey just fingered Clyde Fowler
and Bed Bug for all those car thefts.

to sunny Tallahassee. [Chuckles]

- Uh, it's H-l-

You ever think about that?
- Hmm!

11:47.406 --> 11:50.341
Might as well just take you to Clyde's house
so you can bring him in...

11:50.443 --> 11:53.276
