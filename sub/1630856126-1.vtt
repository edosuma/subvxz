WEBVTT

01:54.625 --> 01:56.375
"It was the end of the '90s."

01:56.916 --> 01:59.125
"We weren't even 16 years old,

01:59.750 --> 02:03.416
and my cousin Lorenzo
was already pretty crazy,

02:03.500 --> 02:04.833
as my mom would say."

02:05.666 --> 02:08.708
"We were supposed to watch
an action movie at the cinema."

02:09.500 --> 02:12.291
"I had just moved to Guadalajara
from Los Altos,

02:12.791 --> 02:17.250
and my cousin brought two friends
to meet and discuss a business idea."

02:17.333 --> 02:18.625
A golf course, cuz.

02:18.708 --> 02:21.041
It's a friend's brother's
father-in-law's land.

02:21.125 --> 02:23.500
We're pitching the project
at the Industrialists' Club.

02:23.583 --> 02:25.166
The only problem is water.

02:25.250 --> 02:28.791
But we have leverage with the nephew
of the director of Jalisco's water agency.

02:28.875 --> 02:33.041
He'll get his cut when we find
an investor with the rest of the money.

02:33.125 --> 02:35.500
So, are we watching the movie or not?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.625
Nah, I have a better idea.

02:42.291 --> 02:44.708
Oh God, yes! So much spunk!

02:44.791 --> 02:48.166
-They talk so weirdly in Spain.
-"So much spunk, mate!"

02:48.250 --> 02:52.416
All right, dipshits. Five minutes each,
while the others wait in the other room.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.750
-Okay?
-Hold up!

02:53.833 --> 02:55.750
We can each choose our section.

02:56.291 --> 02:57.916
I'm first because it's my house.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.666
-Come in.
-Hi.

03:07.375 --> 03:09.458
Hello, good morning.

03:10.708 --> 03:11.875
Is anyone home?

03:13.875 --> 03:14.708
Hi!

03:15.375 --> 03:16.875
I'm here to fix the lamp.

03:19.458 --> 03:20.875
-Hi.
-Hi.

03:20.958 --> 03:22.958
-Please follow me.
-Sure.

03:24.833 --> 03:27.166
God… Wow.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.583
You know, you have a beautiful cock.

03:33.125 --> 03:34.000
Come closer.

03:35.000 --> 03:35.833
Yes.

03:44.583 --> 03:47.708
I don't expect anyone to believe me.

03:59.000 --> 03:59.833
Vale!

03:59.916 --> 04:01.875
-What?
-We're going to Barcelona!

04:01.958 --> 04:03.541
-What?
-I got the scholarship!

04:03.625 --> 04:04.583
-No way!
-Yeah!

04:04.666 --> 04:06.583
-No way!
-No kidding!

04:14.166 --> 04:15.666
Hey, congratulations.

04:23.291 --> 04:25.791
BEFORE GOING TO BARCELONA,

04:25.875 --> 04:30.791
I WENT TO GUADALAJARA
TO SAY GOODBYE TO MY PARENTS.

04:30.875 --> 04:34.750
WHEN THEY CAME TO PICK ME UP, MY MOM…

04:34.833 --> 04:37.250
-Careful!
-Yeah, I saw it.

04:37.333 --> 04:40.041
-Did you pay for parking?
-You pay at the exit.

04:40.125 --> 04:44.208
-What are those machines for, then?
-Dad, if you want, I'll go pay.

04:44.291 --> 04:45.291
Don't worry, son.

04:45.375 --> 04:48.000
You can pay either at the machines
or at the exit.

04:48.083 --> 04:50.458
Anyway, the machines don't give change.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.083
Hey, how's Vale?

04:52.166 --> 04:54.291
-She's fine, Dad. She's great.
-Cool.

04:54.375 --> 04:58.708
She stayed behind to lock up the house
and everything, but she sends her love.

04:59.208 --> 05:01.083
-Give her a hug from us.
-Sure.

05:01.166 --> 05:03.583
By the way, you know who else is there?

05:03.666 --> 05:05.375
The daughter of my friend Lourdes.

05:05.958 --> 05:08.666
She's studying to be a chef.
Her name is Paola.

05:08.750 --> 05:11.333
We said we'd put you two in touch.

05:11.916 --> 05:14.208
Son, I don't know what it is,

05:14.291 --> 05:17.250
but something tells me
you're not coming back.

05:17.333 --> 05:20.791
-Mom.
-No, really. I hope it's true.

05:20.875 --> 05:24.541
I'd love for you to stay there
and make a life for yourself.

05:24.625 --> 05:28.041
I'd love for you
to get a great job at a university.

05:28.125 --> 05:31.250
To become a professor. Imagine!

05:32.416 --> 05:34.500
-Well, yes, it'd be good.
-So good.

05:34.583 --> 05:35.750
Let's see what happens.

05:36.958 --> 05:39.083
-Is this bathroom working?
-Supposedly.

05:39.166 --> 05:41.875
I had to call a plumber
my brother recommended

05:42.500 --> 05:44.458
because you know how your dad is.

05:45.500 --> 05:49.833
The other guy was trying to rip him off.
He said we had to change a ton of pipes.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.625
Anyway, it's not true.

05:52.708 --> 05:55.708
The other bathroom has better pressure.
Shower there if you like.

05:56.250 --> 05:58.000
Sure, Mom. Thanks.

05:58.541 --> 06:00.708
All right. I'll go make the salad.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.250
-Okay.
-And I'll order the sodas.

06:04.416 --> 06:05.875
I'll be right down.

06:05.958 --> 06:07.916
Hi, sweetheart. I've arrived.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.291
I'm unpacking at my parents' house.
They picked me up from the station.

06:11.791 --> 06:14.916
They spend all day
kissing each other nonstop.

06:15.416 --> 06:17.541
Promise me we'll never be like that.

06:18.041 --> 06:19.958
I'll call you later. I love you.

06:21.583 --> 06:23.791
I can totally imagine, my love.

06:24.375 --> 06:27.500
I'm about to get enchiladas
with my dad and Nayeli.

06:27.583 --> 06:28.791
Talk later, okay?

06:29.291 --> 06:30.208
I love you.

06:32.958 --> 06:35.375
Juanpa, son. There you are.

06:36.750 --> 06:37.583
It's Lorenzo.

06:37.666 --> 06:41.083
He couldn't come but he wants
to talk to you before you leave.

06:41.166 --> 06:43.500
You're not answering his messages.

06:43.583 --> 06:45.333
Well… okay.

06:46.083 --> 06:46.916
Thanks.

06:48.458 --> 06:51.416
-What's up, cuz?
-How are you, shithead?

06:51.500 --> 06:53.916
I need to talk to you before you go, man.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.791
I have an interesting project.
You can meet my associates.

06:56.875 --> 06:59.750
-What time are you free tomorrow?
-I don't know if I can.

06:59.833 --> 07:03.458
Don't be a fucking asshole, Juanpis.
We're family, man.

07:03.541 --> 07:05.750
It won't take more than half an hour.

07:06.333 --> 07:10.458
-Why don't you come over? We're all here.
-No fucking way.

07:10.541 --> 07:13.666
We might be family,
but those dinners are a drag.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.916
Tomorrow I need to go get a book,
go to the bank--

07:16.000 --> 07:18.333
Half an hour, man! You won't regret it.

07:18.833 --> 07:22.041
Especially since that scholarship
won't stretch far over there.

07:22.125 --> 07:23.916
Living in Europe is expensive.

07:31.875 --> 07:33.541
Hi, can I ask you something?

07:36.750 --> 07:39.375
Instructions for Living in Mexico.
Do you have it?

07:40.416 --> 07:41.875
Like the one in your hand?

07:42.958 --> 07:46.125
Yes, but I'm looking for a cheaper edition

07:46.833 --> 07:48.125
to highlight, and…

07:54.000 --> 07:55.833
No, that's the only one in stock.

07:56.541 --> 07:58.000
Okay. Thanks.

08:00.708 --> 08:03.416
Hey. Are you the cousin
of your asshole cousin?

08:03.958 --> 08:05.500
-No.
-Don't fuck with me.

08:06.166 --> 08:07.291
Yes, you are. Look.

08:09.125 --> 08:09.958
Let's go.

08:13.041 --> 08:15.125
-Where?
-To see your asshole cousin.

08:23.250 --> 08:25.583
I have to pay for this.

08:27.916 --> 08:28.750
Fine.

08:31.458 --> 08:32.666
-Good afternoon.
-Hi.

09:07.500 --> 09:08.333
Go on, man.

09:14.333 --> 09:15.750
Is this guy your cousin?

09:17.250 --> 09:20.416
He said you're off to Barcelona
to get your master's. Is that true?

09:23.958 --> 09:25.208
Answer, asshole.

09:25.875 --> 09:29.000
One can't shut his trap,
and the cat got the other one's tongue.

09:29.750 --> 09:31.416
More like a pussycat, right?

09:32.875 --> 09:34.666
Well, yeah, I'm getting a PhD.

09:35.666 --> 09:36.500
Anyway,

09:37.583 --> 09:39.416
why is he tied up like that?

09:39.500 --> 09:41.958
This asshole lost us a shitload of money.

09:42.500 --> 09:45.166
He says you two have a project
that we could use.

09:45.250 --> 09:46.083
Is that right?

09:54.166 --> 09:56.125
Isn't it too soon to make a mess?

09:56.625 --> 09:58.125
No, Chucky, it's not too soon.

09:58.208 --> 10:00.666
We have to get things straight
from the start.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.416
Call me back when it's done.

10:03.916 --> 10:04.833
José!

10:20.541 --> 10:21.541
Am I on speaker?

10:21.625 --> 10:24.291
Yes. Shall I switch to video?

10:25.083 --> 10:27.000
No need. Just bring the phone closer.

10:32.166 --> 10:33.000
Juan Pablo.

10:33.958 --> 10:34.958
Answer him.

10:38.416 --> 10:39.291
Yes?

10:39.375 --> 10:42.375
That was to show you
we're not fucking around, okay?

10:42.458 --> 10:44.125
How's Valentina, by the way?

10:46.666 --> 10:48.166
Who is this?

10:48.250 --> 10:49.458
I'm "The Graduate."

10:50.000 --> 10:52.958
Your cousin told us about your master's.
Where will you study?

10:53.458 --> 10:54.500
In Barcelona.

10:54.583 --> 10:56.125
Which university, asshole?

10:57.666 --> 10:58.500
Pompeu.

10:58.583 --> 10:59.916
And what's your major?

11:02.708 --> 11:07.041
A PhD about the limits of humor
in 20th-century Latin American literature.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.208
What?

11:08.291 --> 11:11.791
A PhD about the limits of humor
in 20th-century Latin American literature.

11:11.875 --> 11:15.083
I heard you, asshole.
But what the fuck does that mean?

11:16.083 --> 11:19.250
It's basically about sanctioning
what is acceptable to laugh about.

11:19.750 --> 11:23.125
Like whether we can make jokes
about killing your cousin?

11:24.500 --> 11:27.125
-Yes, something like that.
-And what do you think?

11:30.791 --> 11:32.958
-Well, it depends.
-On what?

11:34.583 --> 11:35.958
On the narrator, right?

11:36.708 --> 11:39.791
If it were my cousin telling the joke--

11:39.875 --> 11:41.000
Fuck off.

11:41.083 --> 11:44.291
Dead people don't tell jokes.
Listen up, fucker.

11:44.375 --> 11:47.083
Go to Barcelona with your girl,
go to the university,

11:47.166 --> 11:48.750
and wait for my instructions.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.875
No joking around, understood?

11:53.291 --> 11:56.583
-If that's Valentina, don't pick up.
-It's not my phone.

11:57.291 --> 11:59.250
It's mine. Get it from my purse.

12:04.625 --> 12:06.208
-It's Dad.
-Answer it.

12:06.791 --> 12:08.166
-But--
-Hey, Dad.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.666
Put it on speaker. You just press here.

12:12.541 --> 12:14.791
-Hello?
-Hello, honey.

12:15.583 --> 12:16.958
-Yes?
-What happened?

12:17.583 --> 12:21.333
They were devastated.
I've never seen my brother like that.

12:21.416 --> 12:23.750
It's the worst pain in the world.

12:23.833 --> 12:25.208
Totally against nature.

12:25.875 --> 12:28.625
Children bury their parents,
not the other way around.

12:28.708 --> 12:31.541
So, did they find out anything else?

12:32.500 --> 12:36.041
Imagine how bad it is,
they wouldn't even let me in as a doctor.

12:37.583 --> 12:39.791
They say reconstruction isn't possible.

12:39.875 --> 12:41.875
We have to have a closed casket.

12:41.958 --> 12:43.583
My God, how awful.

12:43.666 --> 12:45.291
I don't understand.

12:45.375 --> 12:49.083
How on earth did the truck tire
run over his head?

12:49.958 --> 12:53.583
I don't know.
Maybe he got hit by a different car first.

12:53.666 --> 12:56.750
I don't know. The truth is,
I didn't really want to ask.

12:57.250 --> 12:58.541
I'm sorry, but,

12:59.791 --> 13:01.875
could he have jumped or something?

13:02.750 --> 13:03.791
Of course not!

13:04.666 --> 13:08.041
No, my brother says
Lorenzo was super excited

13:08.125 --> 13:11.041
about a new project
that seemed really promising.

13:12.750 --> 13:13.625
Anyway, son!

13:14.125 --> 13:14.958
Yes, Dad?

13:15.458 --> 13:19.041
I wanted to wish you a good trip.
Have fun, enjoy!

13:20.333 --> 13:21.416
Yeah, thanks, Dad.

13:22.125 --> 13:26.458
Hey, I told your uncle and aunt
that your mom's taking you to the airport.

13:26.958 --> 13:31.291
Try to give them a call
or at least text them.

13:33.833 --> 13:34.875
Attention, passengers.

13:34.958 --> 13:39.500
Due to a delay, we've been asked to remain
on the runway until further notice.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.833
Thank you for your patience.
This is beyond the airline's control.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.875
Juan Pablo Villalobos?

13:56.250 --> 13:58.041
-Yes?
-Please come with us.

13:59.541 --> 14:01.166
-Is there a problem?
-I don't know.

14:01.250 --> 14:03.708
We were asked
to remove you from the aircraft.

14:04.458 --> 14:06.291
-No, I have to get to--
-Get him off!

14:06.375 --> 14:09.083
Come on, Officer.
We're all delayed because of him.

14:23.708 --> 14:24.541
It's for you.

14:30.416 --> 14:32.625
-Hello?
-Where's your girlfriend, pal?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.500
-Who is this?
-Vicente.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.791
-Who?
-It's Chucky, dickhead. Where's Valentina?

14:38.875 --> 14:39.875
Well,

14:40.750 --> 14:42.583
she's not coming.

14:42.666 --> 14:44.625
The thing is, we broke up.

14:45.208 --> 14:48.333
The only way to protect her
and everyone you care about

14:48.416 --> 14:51.291
is for you to do abso-fucking-lutely
everything we tell you.

14:51.375 --> 14:54.458
So change the flight,
go get her, and put her on the plane.

14:55.166 --> 14:59.541
But I don't think she'll want to come.
I was quite cruel to her.

15:00.041 --> 15:03.708
Not as cruel as my friends will be
if you don't get her on the plane.

15:12.875 --> 15:13.750
Oh, sis.

15:14.458 --> 15:18.791
I don't know if I can ever forget
the horrible things Juan Pablo said to me.

15:20.833 --> 15:24.083
The worst is he's trying to pretend
nothing happened.

15:24.583 --> 15:30.125
Well, it was a shitty thing to do,
but I think you should turn the page--

16:22.833 --> 16:23.666
Hey, buddy!

16:24.833 --> 16:27.416
Make sure the dishes are dry
before you put them away.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.500
-Sure, you got it.
-All right?

16:32.875 --> 16:35.916
Oh, Ale's coming tomorrow.
Her mom's dropping her off.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.458
-That's cool.
-Yeah, you guys will meet her.

16:38.541 --> 16:40.583
-Great.
-Well, good night.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.791
-Good night.
-Turn the light off after, okay?

16:42.875 --> 16:45.083
-The bills are crazy here.
-Sure, no worries.

ROBERTO BOLAÑO
THE SAVAGE DETECTIVES

17:14.958 --> 17:18.333
"Sometimes I think about the fight
as if it were a dream."

17:18.875 --> 17:21.791
"Sometimes it makes me laugh.
Other times it doesn't."

17:37.708 --> 17:40.541
"One day,
the police will catch Belano and Lima,

17:41.208 --> 17:43.291
but they'll never find us."

17:43.375 --> 17:44.208
"Oh, Lupe,

17:44.833 --> 17:47.291
how I love you, but how wrong you are."

18:43.666 --> 18:45.791
I'm researching the private journals

18:45.875 --> 18:48.375
of female Argentinian
and Uruguayan writers

18:48.458 --> 18:50.083
who chose suicide.

18:50.166 --> 18:54.500
I'm interested in identity
as transgression or denial,

18:54.583 --> 18:58.416
as well as the manifestation
of the will to power, for example.

18:59.791 --> 19:00.791
Very interesting.

19:01.625 --> 19:02.541
Let's continue.

19:03.125 --> 19:06.791
Hi, I'm Nina.
I'm from Chile. I'm 27 years old.

19:06.875 --> 19:11.125
My project is about
the appropriation of political correctness

19:11.208 --> 19:14.750
by the most reactionary,
purportedly libertarian discourses

19:15.708 --> 19:17.125
that defend the idea

19:17.208 --> 19:20.375
that it doesn't matter
where humor is created

19:20.458 --> 19:22.750
when really that's where the problem lies.

19:22.833 --> 19:26.291
I'm working with the notions
of hierarchy and ownership

19:26.791 --> 19:29.750
and concepts like above-below, inside-out.

19:29.833 --> 19:35.375
DOCTORAL RESEARCH PROPOSAL
BY JUAN PABLO VILLALOBOS

19:35.458 --> 19:38.083
FILE - NEW DOCUMENT - BLANK DOCUMENT

19:38.666 --> 19:42.833
THE REASON I HADN'T BEEN ABLE
TO WRITE A NOVEL BEFORE NOW

19:42.916 --> 19:48.750
IS BECAUSE NOTHING WORTH WRITING ABOUT
HAD EVER HAPPENED TO ME

20:39.958 --> 20:40.791
Hi, Vale.

20:41.291 --> 20:42.958
This exhibit looks cool, right?

20:43.041 --> 20:43.875
TODAY

20:48.000 --> 20:49.708
I'll pick you up if you want to go.

20:49.791 --> 20:51.833
Okay, I'll wait for you here.

20:52.333 --> 20:55.666
Vale, have some toast
with dulce de leche if you like.

21:03.125 --> 21:04.833
Sweetie, what are you up to?

21:06.500 --> 21:08.416
Look, Dad, I drew her.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.916
-Who, Vale?
-Yes.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.291
I guess. Why did you make her Black?
Vale isn't Black.

21:13.375 --> 21:15.875
It's the closest match
from the colors I have.

21:15.958 --> 21:18.291
Stop messing around.
Make her a nice drawing.

21:18.833 --> 21:21.791
She's brunette.
Look at that gorgeous hair of hers.

21:22.333 --> 21:23.166
Here.

21:34.541 --> 21:37.708
"And loneliness
is not being able to say it."

21:38.208 --> 21:40.666
"And the gray pier and red houses."

21:42.625 --> 21:44.500
Just nonsense her mother taught her.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.125
Want some toast?

21:52.958 --> 21:54.833
The Graduate wants to talk to you.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.958
I can't. I have plans.

22:09.208 --> 22:10.833
Hey, how much longer?

22:14.333 --> 22:17.041
It's just that… I have plans.

22:18.041 --> 22:19.541
Someone's waiting for me.

22:22.666 --> 22:24.833
Next station…

22:24.916 --> 22:26.500
How's the apartment?

22:26.583 --> 22:29.833
It's way over our budget.

22:30.333 --> 22:32.416
So eat fewer tapas, jackass.

22:32.500 --> 22:36.291
Chino says it's a neighborhood the police
only go in when an old person dies.

22:36.375 --> 22:39.375
Anyway, hang tight
and wait for instructions.

22:40.833 --> 22:43.833
Son, your cousin's funeral
was very sad, very shabby.

22:43.916 --> 22:46.541
A so-called girlfriend of his
from Cozumel showed up.

22:46.625 --> 22:48.041
Carla, Karina, or something.

22:48.125 --> 22:50.583
She came with some friends,
all short and thick

22:50.666 --> 22:54.583
and with the tiniest feet,
as if for climbing the pyramids.

22:55.083 --> 22:59.416
They looked like they were about
to sell hammocks at the funeral.

22:59.500 --> 23:04.416
And your uncle's work colleagues
sent a wreath made of pink carnations.

23:04.500 --> 23:06.708
They thought your cousin was a woman.

23:06.791 --> 23:08.875
They blamed the secretary.

23:08.958 --> 23:12.500
So she sat crying
in a corner all night, poor thing.

23:12.583 --> 23:17.375
Your uncle was very upset, so your dad
had to prescribe him sedatives,

23:17.458 --> 23:22.541
those strong ones they keep in safes
so that drug addicts won't steal them--

23:27.791 --> 23:28.625
Vale.

23:29.791 --> 23:31.750
Juan Pablo would've loved this.

23:36.958 --> 23:40.166
I went because I thought
a bit of normality would do us good.

23:40.250 --> 23:41.291
But, dude!

23:41.916 --> 23:44.250
And we're living
in a stuck-up neighborhood.

23:44.333 --> 23:48.250
I swear there were cheaper options,
but Juan Pablo insisted on it.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.375
It's like he's a stranger.

23:50.458 --> 23:53.958
I feel like he brought
his family's prejudices in his suitcase.

24:00.250 --> 24:03.333
Guess what happened the other day
at the local supermarket.

24:03.416 --> 24:04.333
Excuse me, girl.

24:04.833 --> 24:06.958
Can you get me
the big jar of tomato sauce?

24:07.666 --> 24:09.041
-This one?
-Yes, thank you.

24:09.708 --> 24:10.583
Here.

24:10.666 --> 24:13.416
Come help me get the milk.
It's too heavy for me.

24:16.083 --> 24:18.083
Then she stared at me and said:

24:18.166 --> 24:21.125
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you worked here.

24:22.041 --> 24:23.583
You're very pretty though.

24:24.208 --> 24:26.416
I can't make sense of this city, man.

24:26.916 --> 24:28.250
I can't get used to it.

24:28.833 --> 24:33.416
I don't know if it's because I feel shit,
but it's like there's no hurry here.

24:34.541 --> 24:37.625
As if it's a place
that attracts those who feel lost.

24:44.041 --> 24:47.416
I feel like I'm slowly giving in
to not doing anything.

24:48.166 --> 24:52.125
As if something told me that this way,
at least things can't get any worse.

24:52.208 --> 24:57.291
OCCUSPACE

25:01.583 --> 25:02.916
I met an Italian guy.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.625
Kind of grumpy but funny. Jimi.

25:05.708 --> 25:09.125
Hey, leave that girl alone.
Don't bother her. Come here.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.208
-What's your name?
-His name is Ugo.

25:11.875 --> 25:14.000
He's from Naples
but lives here with his dog.

25:14.083 --> 25:17.416
-I'm from Mexico.
-From Messico? What are you doing here?

25:19.583 --> 25:23.250
We started talking, and honestly,
it made me feel less miserable.

25:23.333 --> 25:25.958
YES TO HOUSING - MORE THAN 1,000 HOMES

25:27.333 --> 25:30.166
At least you can drink
in the street here, sis.

25:36.166 --> 25:39.458
You think you can't forgive him, right?
Listen to your body.

25:39.541 --> 25:42.416
Don't feel bad for hating him
if it's what your body says.

26:07.500 --> 26:11.125
Look who I ran into!

26:12.958 --> 26:13.958
Hey, Vale.

26:20.375 --> 26:22.875
Looks like Juan Pablo just got a message.

26:25.958 --> 26:27.125
It's my classmates.

26:28.291 --> 26:29.666
We're going for a drink.

26:30.625 --> 26:32.625
-Want to come?
-Listen to this!

26:32.708 --> 26:36.708
Juan Pablo asking his girlfriend out.
We have to celebrate. Let's go.

26:39.666 --> 26:42.291
Elizondo was shocked.

26:42.375 --> 26:43.791
She asked me if I knew.

26:43.875 --> 26:45.291
-No idea.
-I had no idea!

26:45.375 --> 26:46.375
-Did you know?
-No.

26:46.458 --> 26:50.541
I had no-- Speak of the devil! Here he is!

26:50.625 --> 26:53.875
-Ask him yourselves.
-Juan Pablo, you changed your thesis?

26:53.958 --> 26:58.375
I had my first tutorial with Elizondo.
Frankly, you left her in a foul mood.

26:58.458 --> 27:01.125
Excuse me. We were sitting there.

27:02.958 --> 27:05.333
-We stepped outside for a smoke.
-Sure, sit.

27:05.416 --> 27:07.708
-What did she say to you?
-Nothing.

27:07.791 --> 27:09.791
-Nothing?
-She didn't take it well.

27:09.875 --> 27:11.125
How did it go? Tell us.

27:11.791 --> 27:12.666
Come in.

27:15.750 --> 27:16.958
-Hello.
-Hello.

27:19.125 --> 27:20.541
-How are you?
-What's up?

27:24.041 --> 27:26.750
Well, I wanted to talk because

27:28.041 --> 27:33.958
I'd like to change my tutor
for my doctoral research project.

27:34.791 --> 27:36.875
Who do you have in mind to replace me?

27:36.958 --> 27:39.166
-Write this down.
-Hang on.

27:40.041 --> 27:40.875
One second.

27:55.708 --> 27:56.833
Yes?

27:56.916 --> 27:58.958
Do you have a pen? A ballpoint?

28:04.625 --> 28:05.458
Thank you.

28:12.125 --> 28:13.125
Okay, ready.

28:13.625 --> 28:18.875
-R-I-P-O-L-L.
-Yes.

28:20.375 --> 28:21.208
Ripoll.

28:21.291 --> 28:22.291
Meritxell?

28:23.000 --> 28:23.833
Yes.

28:25.833 --> 28:29.208
I'd like to know what your project
has to do with gender studies.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.416
I won't lift a finger
to get you a change of tutor.

28:32.500 --> 28:35.416
Do it yourself,
and bring me the papers to sign.

28:35.500 --> 28:36.500
Okay.

28:37.208 --> 28:39.583
-Are you from Guadalajara too?
-What?

28:39.666 --> 28:43.000
-Are you from Guadalajara too?
-No, I'm from Veracruz.

28:43.791 --> 28:45.291
The land of son jarocho.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.416
So, how do you know Juan Pablo?

28:57.375 --> 28:59.458
Excuse me. I'm going to the ladies' room.

28:59.541 --> 29:03.791
I'm sure she already knew
what you were going in there for.

29:03.875 --> 29:05.875
Definitely. I'm sure she knew.

29:06.375 --> 29:08.708
-Yeah.
-Sure, I guess.

29:08.791 --> 29:09.708
What a pain.

29:14.166 --> 29:15.500
Are you there, dude?

29:16.375 --> 29:17.791
Let me know if I can call you.

29:17.875 --> 29:21.208
It's pretty loud in here,
but text me, and I'll call you.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.541
Any problem with the change?

29:38.625 --> 29:41.250
No. I just have to do some paperwork.

29:41.333 --> 29:43.416
When do you have class with Ripoll?

29:43.500 --> 29:45.208
There's a seminar next week.

29:45.291 --> 29:46.791
Good. Listen up.

29:47.291 --> 29:49.625
Find out everything you can
about Laia Carbonell.

29:50.291 --> 29:54.250
She's one of Dr. Ripoll's students.
I'm sure she'll be at the seminar.

29:54.333 --> 29:55.875
Laia Carbonell.

29:55.958 --> 29:58.083
-Who is she?
-Get close to her.

29:58.166 --> 30:01.250
I need you to make contact.
Don't fuck it up, asshole.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.625
Learn all the gender study buzzwords.

30:03.708 --> 30:06.833
But that's not my specialty.
What will I say to her?

30:07.875 --> 30:10.541
Get up to speed, or you're dead.

30:11.875 --> 30:13.583
What do I have to do, then?

30:14.666 --> 30:15.958
You're gonna screw her.

30:16.541 --> 30:17.416
What?

30:17.500 --> 30:20.333
You're going to fuck Laia, asshole.

30:21.791 --> 30:23.958
Have you forgotten how we speak in Mex--

30:48.791 --> 30:51.750
-Hello.
-Hi, dude. Where are you?

30:52.375 --> 30:54.375
I don't know. It's like a parking lot.

30:55.541 --> 30:56.625
Why are you there?

30:56.708 --> 30:59.291
I went to a bar
with Juan Pablo and his classmates.

31:00.458 --> 31:01.583
How was it?

31:01.666 --> 31:02.708
It fucking sucked.

31:02.791 --> 31:04.083
Know what I found out?

31:05.458 --> 31:06.791
Are you drunk?

31:06.875 --> 31:08.958
No, I'm taking a piss.

31:09.041 --> 31:11.000
Dude, check this out.

31:11.083 --> 31:14.291
I ran into him by chance
as he was going out,

31:14.375 --> 31:17.250
so the prick
had no choice but to invite me.

31:17.333 --> 31:19.458
Obviously, I didn't know anyone there.

31:19.541 --> 31:21.166
When we arrived, I realized

31:21.250 --> 31:24.250
he hadn't told his classmates
he had a girlfriend.

31:24.958 --> 31:26.708
Why don't you talk to him?

31:26.791 --> 31:28.666
What are you doing? Get out of here!

31:29.250 --> 31:31.250
-Shit, hold on.
-What is it?

31:31.333 --> 31:33.250
A guy just caught me, man.

31:33.333 --> 31:35.166
-I'll call you tomorrow, okay?
-Okay.

32:02.625 --> 32:03.625
Hey, Vale!

32:04.250 --> 32:05.208
Everything okay?

32:06.875 --> 32:08.625
Would you like an empanada?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.666
Hey, I didn't see you there.
Want an empanada?

32:13.208 --> 32:14.041
They're good.

32:14.541 --> 32:16.166
They're homemade and fresh.

32:17.166 --> 32:18.000
Yeah?

32:18.750 --> 32:19.958
They're spectacular.

32:21.375 --> 32:22.750
Go on. Sit down.

32:22.833 --> 32:24.958
Are you going to eat it like a taco?

32:25.041 --> 32:26.750
Go on. Sit down. Enjoy it.

32:26.833 --> 32:30.208
Come on. Why are you so shy?

32:31.625 --> 32:33.041
Want a glass of wine?

32:33.125 --> 32:34.791
-No. I'm fine.
-Sure?

32:34.875 --> 32:36.375
-Well, cheers.
-It's good.

32:36.875 --> 32:37.708
See?

32:42.500 --> 32:43.333
Dude,

32:44.416 --> 32:46.166
you know what I like about you?

32:47.458 --> 32:49.875
You're not like those fools
who come to Barcelona

32:49.958 --> 32:53.000
and spend all day on La Rambla like idiots

32:53.083 --> 32:55.291
until a Gypsy takes their wallet.

32:55.375 --> 32:56.458
You're different.

32:57.041 --> 32:57.875
Aren't you?

32:59.958 --> 33:04.250
Have I got you pegged, or what?
You're different. You do your own thing.

33:04.333 --> 33:07.750
You don't let this fake city
dazzle you with its glitter.

33:09.916 --> 33:13.458
Listen, a Chilean couple
used to live in your room.

33:13.958 --> 33:18.083
They'd come home every night
going on about parks and museums.

33:18.166 --> 33:22.333
Like, I live here, dude!
I don't do tourist shit.

33:23.291 --> 33:24.875
Anyway, they fought.

33:24.958 --> 33:28.666
She hooked up with a Catalan guy,
and he kicked her to the curb.

33:29.166 --> 33:30.208
And this guy,

33:30.791 --> 33:34.916
instead of making the best
of a bad situation

33:35.000 --> 33:39.500
and going around the world in 80 girls,
because you can do that here.

33:39.583 --> 33:42.375
You can put little flags
on the map. It's crazy.

33:42.458 --> 33:47.333
You have Chinese, African,
Scandinavian, Latin girls…

33:47.416 --> 33:48.625
And what does he do?

33:49.416 --> 33:50.916
He goes back to Santiago.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.500
Santiago, dude.

33:53.000 --> 33:57.041
You know? Not Mexico City, Buenos Aires…

33:57.541 --> 33:59.333
You know? Not Bogotá.

33:59.416 --> 34:00.916
No, Santiago.

34:01.416 --> 34:02.291
Want a line?

34:02.375 --> 34:03.208
Sure?

34:03.708 --> 34:05.000
Do you mind if I do it here?

34:12.041 --> 34:15.000
Dude, what's going on
with you and Juan Pablo?

34:15.500 --> 34:17.375
The other day I asked him
where he was going.

34:17.458 --> 34:19.416
He said, "Catalan class."

34:19.500 --> 34:21.541
Are you kidding me? Catalan classes?

34:21.625 --> 34:24.083
Catalans don't want us to speak Catalan.

34:25.666 --> 34:27.500
You don't want a bump? No?

34:28.583 --> 34:29.708
Dude, I see you.

34:30.583 --> 34:34.916
I know you like to walk around
in those rags like a Parisian girl

34:35.000 --> 34:37.875
who likes to dress like that,
sexy with messy hair,

34:37.958 --> 34:39.666
smokes, and has coffee breath.

34:39.750 --> 34:42.916
But you're something else.
You're Latina. Don't kid yourself.

34:43.000 --> 34:43.916
Look at you.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.791
You're gorgeous, Vale.
You're Latina. You have--

34:46.875 --> 34:48.083
-No, Facundo!
-What?

34:48.166 --> 34:49.958
-What the hell, man?
-What?

34:50.041 --> 34:53.750
I live here with Juan Pablo, you jerk.
This is the last thing I need.

34:53.833 --> 34:55.375
-For fuck's sake.
-But you…

34:55.875 --> 35:00.125
You couldn't be more stupid if you tried.
What does Juan Pablo have to do with it?

35:00.208 --> 35:02.916
Juan Pablo and you
are going in opposite directions.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.583
You're one of those typical couples
that Barcelona breaks up.

35:06.666 --> 35:09.750
The couples that come here
can't handle it, so they split up.

35:09.833 --> 35:12.583
You know why? Barcelona is a real bitch.

35:12.666 --> 35:14.333
I'm talking from experience.

35:15.083 --> 35:18.125
You know what Juan Pablo
is doing right now?

35:18.208 --> 35:21.333
He's screwing some girl
he picked up in a bar.

35:21.416 --> 35:24.958
A girl as dumb as you but a bit hotter.

35:26.166 --> 35:29.541
No wonder
people don't like Argentinians, asshole.

35:35.208 --> 35:37.375
Fuck off. Who do you think you are?

35:37.458 --> 35:40.208
So dignified! Are you María la del Barrio?

35:46.083 --> 35:48.000
Hey! It's The Graduate.

35:51.833 --> 35:53.666
You don't hang up on me, asshole.

35:53.750 --> 35:55.708
Your dad will go first.

35:56.916 --> 36:00.708
I sent one of my guys to him
the other day to get a spot checked.

36:01.666 --> 36:03.166
He wanted to run tests,

36:03.250 --> 36:05.333
but it was just a bruise
from chasing an idiot

36:05.416 --> 36:07.916
who was trying to give us the runaround.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.541
A fine doctor, Mr. José Luis.

36:14.666 --> 36:17.458
-I need to talk to Dad.
-Can't you wait?

36:17.541 --> 36:20.958
Can't you see
your parents need a bit of privacy?

36:21.041 --> 36:22.916
Don't worry, son.

36:23.416 --> 36:24.250
Come in.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.416
-Lorenzo--
-What about Lorenzo, Juan Pablo?

36:30.500 --> 36:34.000
-It wasn't a hit-and-run--
-Son, your rash is back!

36:34.083 --> 36:36.875
Seems like Juan Pablo
is having a nightmare.

36:38.250 --> 36:39.958
And neurodermatitis.

36:40.041 --> 36:41.291
It's allergies.

36:41.375 --> 36:44.958
He's allergic to introducing
his girlfriend to his classmates.

36:45.041 --> 36:46.666
What are you talking about?

36:47.208 --> 36:50.250
Maybe he left the bar 'cause he's ashamed
of his dermatitis and his girlfriend.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.916
You left without saying a word.

36:55.333 --> 36:57.125
At least we had an argument today.

37:13.166 --> 37:16.416
As you can see,
this is an artist whose work comprises

37:16.500 --> 37:19.583
many of the topics we've been working on,

37:19.666 --> 37:24.000
like opacity, rejection, fragmentation.

37:24.083 --> 37:26.000
Let's open the floor. Who wants to start?

37:27.375 --> 37:28.833
Over there, Laia.

37:29.375 --> 37:31.708
I understand the artist's intention

37:31.791 --> 37:35.000
and mostly agree
with her research and questions.

37:35.083 --> 37:37.416
But I also think that,
from our current perspective,

37:37.500 --> 37:39.625
there's something problematic
about her gaze.

37:39.708 --> 37:43.083
You could say
that she inadvertently perpetuates

37:43.166 --> 37:47.208
the ideas of fragility, poeticism,
and abstract representation,

37:47.291 --> 37:49.625
as characteristics of femininity.

37:49.708 --> 37:50.875
Fragility.

37:50.958 --> 37:54.916
Did anyone else see that
or want to comment on it?

37:55.000 --> 37:56.083
-Mahle?
-Sure.

37:56.166 --> 38:00.500
I think there's a myriad of possibilities
in the spaces and the gazes.

38:00.583 --> 38:01.958
To each their own.

38:02.041 --> 38:07.625
Today we have female directors
making straight, hardcore porn.

38:07.708 --> 38:10.166
I think it's great
if it's from their perspective.

38:10.250 --> 38:12.458
You really think that's great, Mahle?

38:12.541 --> 38:14.291
Laia Carbonell, please.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.500
Let's keep it constructive.

38:16.583 --> 38:20.750
All I'm saying is we've gone over and over

38:20.833 --> 38:26.000
how, despite the purest
and most righteous intentions,

38:26.083 --> 38:29.833
the patriarchy perpetuates
the false idea of equality

38:29.916 --> 38:32.000
and empowerment, so I disagree.

38:32.083 --> 38:36.750
I also think that to suggest machismo
and objectification are exclusive to men

38:36.833 --> 38:38.500
is shortsighted and unhelpful.

38:38.583 --> 38:40.833
Why would you assume we all want the same?

38:40.916 --> 38:43.333
When you watch porn, you do it to orgasm.

38:43.416 --> 38:46.208
Or do you wait for the credits
to see who directed it

38:46.291 --> 38:48.291
and decide whether you liked it?

38:48.375 --> 38:53.041
Mahle and Laia Carbonell,
these are very interesting points,

38:53.125 --> 38:57.375
but let's move on to the next video,
directed by Miguel Silveira,

38:57.458 --> 39:00.625
who runs a research group
in Santiago de Compostela

39:00.708 --> 39:04.083
on the oppression and repression
of phallic discourse.

39:04.166 --> 39:05.208
Laura, lights.

39:08.708 --> 39:11.041
Hi, my name is Miguel Silveira.

39:11.583 --> 39:15.208
And this is my piece,
The Oppression of the Phallus,

39:15.916 --> 39:19.416
which I made with my partner, Xavi.

39:20.125 --> 39:21.583
It includes

39:22.833 --> 39:24.916
the following elements.

39:26.041 --> 39:26.916
When

39:28.250 --> 39:29.125
I call…

39:37.041 --> 39:40.833
By the way, before we go,
we have a new classmate.

39:40.916 --> 39:44.041
Juan Pablo, could you
introduce yourself, please?

39:46.500 --> 39:47.625
Hi.

39:47.708 --> 39:49.958
I'm Juan Pablo. I'm from Mexico.

39:50.041 --> 39:52.125
In my thesis,

39:53.083 --> 39:56.708
I analyzed the stories
of Mexican writer Jorge Ibargüengoitia.

39:58.875 --> 40:01.166
Tell us a bit about your project.

40:03.291 --> 40:06.125
Well, my research project is about…

40:08.041 --> 40:12.083
Well, I explore humor
that is misogynistic and

40:12.916 --> 40:14.041
perhaps homophobic.

40:18.333 --> 40:21.541
For example, in one of his stories,
there's a person who thinks

40:21.625 --> 40:26.291
that the greatest humiliation is
for his doctor to put a finger up his ass.

40:26.375 --> 40:28.875
In his anus. I mean--

40:28.958 --> 40:31.333
Is it funny to you
that he finds it humiliating?

40:31.916 --> 40:36.458
Well, the truth is,
when I read it, it made me laugh.

40:36.958 --> 40:42.750
But it's a matter of cultural context
and character construction.

40:42.833 --> 40:45.625
I don't personally think
it's humiliating, but--

40:45.708 --> 40:47.708
Don't you think
celebrating a story like that

40:47.791 --> 40:50.458
reinforces homophobic stereotypes?

40:51.375 --> 40:53.916
I mean, it depends.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.708
If by "celebrating" you mean

40:57.791 --> 41:01.875
that I've spent
all these years studying this,

41:01.958 --> 41:03.916
then honestly, no. Right?

41:04.541 --> 41:08.000
At the end of the day,
that's why we're having this conversation.

41:08.083 --> 41:10.916
So, what do you think it means
that you found it funny?

41:11.000 --> 41:13.125
It depends, right?

41:13.750 --> 41:17.458
Because I mean, right now I don't think
it's funny that I found it funny.

41:18.041 --> 41:23.291
But if I told someone else about
what's happening between me and you all,

41:23.375 --> 41:26.916
I think it offers a lot of room
for something to be humorously inclusive--

41:27.000 --> 41:29.041
Thank you, Juan Pablo.

41:30.833 --> 41:32.916
Welcome. See you all next week.

41:33.958 --> 41:37.416
Don't forget to send your topics
if you haven't already.

41:37.500 --> 41:42.041
…equally, that is just like, privileged…

42:23.083 --> 42:23.916
Hello.

42:25.416 --> 42:28.125
I was just with you all
in Dr. Ripoll's class.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.125
Yes, we remember.

42:31.833 --> 42:33.083
It was half an hour ago.

42:33.750 --> 42:35.791
Ten more minutes,
and you'd have been lynched.

42:42.500 --> 42:45.625
Actually, someone had already
fired them up a bit, no?

42:48.333 --> 42:49.166
What's up?

42:55.875 --> 42:57.958
So you're researching sexist humor.

42:59.208 --> 43:03.541
Well, I'm actually more interested
in the limits of humor.

43:04.208 --> 43:07.083
But these are difficult times
to talk about that stuff.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.583
Better not discuss
that last video we saw, then.

43:12.166 --> 43:15.125
Actually, one thing did interest me.

43:15.208 --> 43:18.958
It reminded me of an article
by Gayle Rubin and Judith Butler.

43:19.041 --> 43:21.500
-Who?
-Gayle Rubin and Judith Butler.

43:22.166 --> 43:25.375
They interpret the history of sexuality
through history of materials.

43:25.458 --> 43:27.333
-Among other things.
-What things?

43:27.416 --> 43:31.416
Well, it talks about
urban planning and Chinatowns.

43:31.958 --> 43:33.166
I mean…

43:34.000 --> 43:37.208
And dark spaces,
where there's no electricity, for example.

43:37.291 --> 43:39.375
But what's that got to do with the video?

43:40.291 --> 43:44.375
Well, it's impossible
to understand the history of fetishism

43:44.458 --> 43:47.416
without understanding
the history of rubber

43:47.500 --> 43:49.500
and the exploitation
of the Amazonian Indians

43:49.583 --> 43:52.000
by English companies in the 19th century.

43:52.500 --> 43:53.333
That is…

43:54.041 --> 43:54.875
I mean,

43:56.291 --> 43:59.500
Dr. Silveira and his partner
wouldn't have been able to achieve

44:00.208 --> 44:03.291
those "feats," so to speak,

44:04.125 --> 44:09.958
without an industry
producing these sexual prostheses,

44:10.458 --> 44:14.750
without going back to
the exploitation of the Putumayo Indians.

44:14.833 --> 44:17.041
But what are you trying to say? That…

44:18.666 --> 44:22.166
that we should feel guilty
every time we cum with a dildo?

44:24.000 --> 44:24.875
Well, I mean,

44:26.125 --> 44:30.541
I guess it'd be enough to apologize
for your colonialist mentality

44:30.625 --> 44:32.041
before pulling up your panties.

44:33.625 --> 44:36.000
-I mean…
-What was your name, Mexican boy?

44:36.583 --> 44:37.416
Juan Pablo.

44:37.500 --> 44:41.625
Look, Juan Pablo, to talk about fetishism,
you should also analyze misogyny

44:41.708 --> 44:44.416
because many of these
"good savages" you're defending

44:44.500 --> 44:46.041
were misogynistic as fuck.

44:46.958 --> 44:48.750
Do you know the legend of Pygmalion?

44:49.666 --> 44:51.458
I thought of that because…

44:51.541 --> 44:54.458
Well, this is our stop.

45:05.916 --> 45:07.916
-What's up?
-This…

45:08.666 --> 45:10.458
I can't do what you asked me.

45:10.958 --> 45:13.958
-What are you talking about?
-Can't I just befriend her?

45:15.125 --> 45:16.500
Friends with a Catalan?

45:17.166 --> 45:20.416
You keep making jokes.
You think you're so clever.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.625
Make an effort, asshole.

45:22.708 --> 45:25.000
Show us why they gave you
that scholarship.

45:43.458 --> 45:46.791
"Some experiences are presumed
to be more valuable than others."

45:46.875 --> 45:50.666
"It is known that in the times
of capitalism, the stuff that life,

45:50.750 --> 45:54.250
time, or the memory
of a previous time is made of

45:54.333 --> 45:57.208
has become,
like everything else, a commodity."

45:57.291 --> 46:00.208
"Traveling through Latin America,
Thailand, and Canada."

46:00.291 --> 46:04.291
"Living in New York, Madrid, or Paris
because that's where things happen."

46:04.375 --> 46:09.166
"Consuming youth in search of a body
that is always one step further away."

46:09.750 --> 46:13.791
"These are all trivial consequences
of applying economic theory

46:13.875 --> 46:15.666
to this new commodity form."

46:15.750 --> 46:16.875
"Free time."

46:17.416 --> 46:18.875
"And the expression is perverse

46:18.958 --> 46:21.708
because it implies
the existence of time that isn't free."

46:21.791 --> 46:22.958
"That is someone else's."

46:29.708 --> 46:31.125
Thanks very much, Munir.

46:31.208 --> 46:33.208
Living Things. An excellent debut novel.

46:33.291 --> 46:35.750
Please don't forget to buy it. Now…

46:35.833 --> 46:39.208
Everything is auto-fiction, really.
Don't you think?

46:40.000 --> 46:41.666
-Well…
-Do you write too?

46:43.208 --> 46:44.208
Yes.

46:44.291 --> 46:46.416
I'm waiting to apply for a master's.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
Waiting for what?

46:49.583 --> 46:51.625
To be eligible for a scholarship.

46:51.708 --> 46:55.125
In Mexico, you have to wait
two years after getting a grant--

46:55.208 --> 46:56.541
Sorry to interrupt.

46:56.625 --> 46:57.875
They're closing here,

46:57.958 --> 47:00.708
and we're going for a drink
at a nearby bar.

47:00.791 --> 47:03.125
Okay, I'll get my things and say goodbye.

47:03.208 --> 47:04.125
Are you coming?

47:05.875 --> 47:06.708
Come.

48:02.166 --> 48:03.041
Hi.

48:04.375 --> 48:05.208
Hello.

48:05.958 --> 48:08.875
Did you see the email I sent you?

48:09.625 --> 48:14.458
I came across your email address
on Dr. Ripoll's seminar list,

48:15.125 --> 48:17.375
so I sent you the article we talked about.

48:17.458 --> 48:20.541
Yes, I saw it,
but I haven't opened it yet.

48:21.833 --> 48:23.166
Do you know this book?

48:27.333 --> 48:28.958
Yes, but I haven't read it.

48:29.833 --> 48:31.958
It's good. It's really good.

48:32.666 --> 48:35.208
I was thinking,

48:35.833 --> 48:38.500
would you like to go
for a coffee with me sometime?

48:39.500 --> 48:40.375
Let's go.

48:41.791 --> 48:42.791
Right now?

48:42.875 --> 48:45.166
Yes, I feel like getting coffee. Let's go.

48:46.833 --> 48:49.916
But don't get your hopes up, Mexican.
I like women.

48:50.000 --> 48:50.833
Okay.

48:50.916 --> 48:52.166
We already knew that.

48:52.791 --> 48:55.291
-This is where Valentina comes in.
-What?

48:55.375 --> 48:58.083
We need to access Laia's inner circle.

48:58.166 --> 49:00.458
And the easiest, fastest way

49:00.541 --> 49:02.166
is through sex.

49:02.250 --> 49:04.208
-I'll go to the police.
-Will you?

49:04.708 --> 49:07.458
If you go to the Urban Guard,
ask for Gimeno.

49:07.541 --> 49:08.916
Give him a hug from me.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.750
If you go with the Mozos,
say hi to Riquer.

49:11.833 --> 49:14.375
-What will you even say?
-I'll tell them about Lorenzo--

49:14.458 --> 49:16.291
Your cousin was hit by a truck.

49:17.208 --> 49:20.083
I'll send you a copy
of the death certificate if you want.

49:21.958 --> 49:23.166
Listen, asshole.

49:23.666 --> 49:25.625
Write down this phone number.

49:25.708 --> 49:27.708
Call this guy for me.

49:28.583 --> 49:30.500
He'll give you what you need.

49:30.583 --> 49:34.458
I'm not stupid enough
to trust your skills in seduction.

49:36.500 --> 49:37.666
Thanks, Chino.

49:44.458 --> 49:46.708
Your hand. Hold out your hand.

49:47.916 --> 49:48.750
Take it.

49:49.833 --> 49:50.750
That's it.

49:53.583 --> 49:55.916
What happened to your face, man?

49:56.583 --> 49:59.208
I just have a few allergies.

49:59.291 --> 50:00.166
Jesus.

50:00.250 --> 50:02.250
Have you been here long?

50:02.750 --> 50:05.041
-Well…
-Not long, right?

50:05.125 --> 50:07.625
Barcelona is a bit idealized, you know?

50:07.708 --> 50:11.833
This city used to be awesome,
but now it's gone to shit.

50:11.916 --> 50:14.208
The tourists, the vibe, I don't know.

50:14.291 --> 50:18.875
It's totally whored out to tourism.
It's good for me, but it's shit.

50:18.958 --> 50:20.500
Yeah, I guess.

50:24.291 --> 50:26.958
Right. The beer's on you, okay?

50:27.041 --> 50:28.541
The pills are paid for.

50:31.458 --> 50:34.750
By the way,
these are the best pills out there.

50:34.833 --> 50:38.208
There's nothing stronger.
The best aspirin in Europe.

50:38.291 --> 50:40.000
-Yeah.
-People kill over them.

50:40.083 --> 50:43.125
They kill each other.
And you get them for free.

50:43.208 --> 50:44.875
-Yeah.
-Who the hell are you?

50:46.458 --> 50:49.625
Anyway, see you around, yeah?

50:50.208 --> 50:52.583
Chino, he'll get the beer.

50:53.291 --> 50:56.000
Have a good day, fam. Later.

51:25.583 --> 51:27.833
If literature has taught me anything,

51:27.916 --> 51:31.875
it's that in order to achieve
what is impossible, absurd, or magical,

51:31.958 --> 51:34.125
you just need
to meet a series of requirements.

51:37.625 --> 51:40.708
Worst case scenario, you make a new world.

51:41.625 --> 51:44.458
Wow. Juan Pablo's invited me to a party.

51:44.541 --> 51:47.000
See? Maybe you manifested it.

51:47.083 --> 51:50.125
Giuseppe, for a squatter,
you're pretty New Age.

51:50.708 --> 51:51.791
How's it going?

51:51.875 --> 51:53.875
One with different operating rules.

52:05.708 --> 52:07.000
-Hey!
-Hi! How's it going?

52:07.083 --> 52:08.541
Good. How are you?

52:08.625 --> 52:10.208
-Good, and you?
-Good.

52:10.291 --> 52:12.708
-Hi.
-This is Laia, Valentina. My girlfriend.

52:12.791 --> 52:14.708
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

52:15.291 --> 52:18.916
Best case scenario,
you just need to follow a narrative logic.

52:20.750 --> 52:22.875
And let the characters come to life.

52:44.958 --> 52:45.791
Vale!

52:49.541 --> 52:50.375
Vale?

52:51.291 --> 52:52.416
What are you doing?

53:37.541 --> 53:38.583
Want a shot?

53:40.833 --> 53:41.916
Want one?

53:42.833 --> 53:44.500
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

53:59.750 --> 54:03.666
Then, you just have to let
the narrative causes and effects flow.

54:07.416 --> 54:08.250
Taxi!

54:09.666 --> 54:10.500
And then,

54:11.333 --> 54:12.708
like in a classic novel,

54:14.125 --> 54:15.791
the impossible materializes.

54:23.083 --> 54:24.791
Do you like to watch, Mexican?

54:26.416 --> 54:28.750
Juan Pablo would've loved this too.

54:35.666 --> 54:42.666
A FEW DAYS AND A FEW FIGHTS
THAT I'D RATHER NOT WRITE ABOUT LATER,

54:42.750 --> 54:46.000
VALENTINA ENDED UP LEAVING,

54:48.041 --> 54:50.791
BUT NOT LEAVING BARCELONA.

54:50.875 --> 54:53.208
Dude, after giving it a lot of thought,

54:53.291 --> 54:57.416
I think this story is the classic tale
of the hero's transformation,

54:57.500 --> 54:59.916
which is ultimately
the essence of every story.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.083
In order to transform his future,

55:02.166 --> 55:04.708
the hero must betray his past
and his people.

55:05.208 --> 55:08.416
When I say "hero,"
I mean that fucking piece of shit.

55:09.875 --> 55:14.541
All that was missing was the promise,
the reason for his fucking transformation.

55:15.041 --> 55:16.125
Laia.

55:16.208 --> 55:17.666
That fucking night,

55:17.750 --> 55:20.791
the past, present, and future
went to bed together.

55:21.375 --> 55:23.375
But in the morning,
the present was the past,

55:23.458 --> 55:25.291
and the future was taking over.

55:27.458 --> 55:29.875
In conclusion,
I shouldn't have come to Barcelona

55:29.958 --> 55:33.375
or been stupid enough
to think our relationship could work.

55:42.958 --> 55:45.500
Will the princess pay for the gas bill?

55:45.583 --> 55:46.416
What?

55:46.500 --> 55:49.541
You left the heating on,
and that's paid separately.

55:50.333 --> 55:52.708
And you didn't tell me the dog was so big.

55:53.208 --> 55:56.791
You didn't tell me the gas was separate.
It's cold as fuck.

55:56.875 --> 55:59.208
So buy a blanket at the dollar store.

56:19.916 --> 56:21.833
What's up, dude? How are you?

56:22.750 --> 56:25.083
I'm just here, looking after Ugo.

56:26.083 --> 56:28.666
Though I'm no longer sure
who is looking after whom.

56:29.458 --> 56:32.000
Turns out squatters
also celebrate Christmas,

56:32.083 --> 56:33.666
so Jimi went to see his family.

56:34.166 --> 56:36.500
I don't really understand his ideology.

56:36.583 --> 56:38.833
Truth is,
I don't understand anything anymore.

56:38.916 --> 56:39.750
Here.

56:40.833 --> 56:42.333
The biscuits are for him.

56:43.500 --> 56:45.000
Thanks, Giuseppe.

56:45.083 --> 56:47.500
Dude, holy shit.
You won't believe what I did.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.375
I went to Jules Verne Street
and waited for Juan Pablo to come out.

56:51.458 --> 56:54.875
He was with that bitch.
Wasn't she supposed to be a lesbian?

56:54.958 --> 56:57.166
The rash on his face has spread.

56:57.250 --> 56:58.166
Poor guy.

56:59.333 --> 57:00.791
He was wearing a new coat.

57:00.875 --> 57:01.958
According to Jimi,

57:02.500 --> 57:03.541
Scandinavian design.

57:06.125 --> 57:07.625
You're obsessed.

57:07.708 --> 57:11.000
That jerk did you dirty.
You gotta move on.

57:11.083 --> 57:13.875
Go have fun, fuck someone, but get a grip.

57:14.583 --> 57:16.666
Your sister's right.
You can't go on like this.

57:16.750 --> 57:19.083
Sometimes revenge is healthy, you know?

57:22.875 --> 57:24.458
I don't know, Giuseppe.

57:24.541 --> 57:27.041
Maybe I've been too harsh
since we got here.

57:27.125 --> 57:30.291
I don't think so.
If you want, I can scare him.

57:30.375 --> 57:34.166
Give me the address, I'll pay him a visit,
and he'll shit his pants.

57:34.250 --> 57:35.750
And you'll feel better.

58:25.666 --> 58:27.375
I want my Christmas present.

58:28.875 --> 58:29.833
I'm cold.

58:31.208 --> 58:32.500
My coat was stolen.

58:34.625 --> 58:37.708
I can't afford another one.
I can't afford anything.

58:38.291 --> 58:41.333
I want the one you just bought.
I'm coming over.

58:43.666 --> 58:45.000
Vale, wait.

58:45.083 --> 58:47.916
I told you a thousand times
I'd pay for your flight home.

01:00:05.666 --> 01:00:08.041
What's up? Juanchi says you can have it.

01:00:26.583 --> 01:00:30.958
THEN I REMEMBERED
HOW SENSITIVE VALENTINA WAS TO THE COLD,

01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:35.333
HER FEET USED TO BE FREEZING
EVEN IN MEXICO.

01:00:35.416 --> 01:00:39.125
I NEARLY WENT DOWNSTAIRS
TO TELL HER EVERYTHING,

01:00:39.208 --> 01:00:42.125
BUT I CAN'T PUT HER AT RISK.

01:00:43.875 --> 01:00:46.416
I'LL HAVE TO GET A NEW COAT.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:49.000
You can't call your mom at Christmas, son?

01:00:49.625 --> 01:00:54.208
Your dad waited up all night,
but I told him it was late in Europe.

01:00:54.916 --> 01:00:57.583
You're not back with Valentina, are you?

01:00:58.083 --> 01:01:01.416
You know I've always respected
your decisions, don't you?

01:01:01.916 --> 01:01:05.083
But now that you've finally
opened your eyes,

01:01:05.166 --> 01:01:08.916
I can tell you the truth,
that Valentina isn't for you.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.500
Named after chili sauce, eyes like a toad,
and a mouth fit to shuck corn.

01:01:13.583 --> 01:01:15.375
No, son…

01:01:46.458 --> 01:01:47.916
Don't greet me, idiot.

01:01:49.125 --> 01:01:49.958
Walk.

01:01:52.458 --> 01:01:53.958
What's that on your face?

01:01:54.041 --> 01:01:56.708
It's acute neurodermatitis.

01:01:57.541 --> 01:01:59.750
May I ask what the hell you're doing?

01:01:59.833 --> 01:02:02.083
I never told you to dump Valentina.

01:02:02.166 --> 01:02:04.583
You're always breaking up
with the poor girl.

01:02:04.666 --> 01:02:05.916
She wanted to leave.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.875
-I can't force her--
-That's bullshit.

01:02:09.041 --> 01:02:12.708
Did you believe
all that crap you read to hoodwink Laia?

01:02:14.583 --> 01:02:16.125
I told you eleven o'clock.

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:17.666
Want me to wait?

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:21.333
I want it to look like you came over
to sell us beer, and we said no.

01:02:21.958 --> 01:02:22.916
Take a hike.

01:02:28.708 --> 01:02:31.958
That fucker behind us…
Don't turn around, asshole!

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:36.208
-Your girlfriend's family sent him.
-She's not my girlfriend.

01:02:37.166 --> 01:02:41.125
You raised suspicions, asshole.
Exactly what we didn't want.

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:44.416
You shouldn't have
broken up with Valentina.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.458
Because of you, we'll have to gamble
everything on one card.

01:02:49.958 --> 01:02:52.208
Tell Laia that your godfather visited you,

01:02:52.291 --> 01:02:54.708
that he got his master's
in Barcelona a few years back,

01:02:54.791 --> 01:02:56.791
and her father was his teacher.

01:02:58.458 --> 01:03:03.208
Tell her it's a crazy coincidence
we only just figured out.

01:03:04.041 --> 01:03:06.291
"My godfather
speaks very highly of your dad."

01:03:06.375 --> 01:03:08.083
"They're very fond of each other,

01:03:08.166 --> 01:03:10.833
and he'd love
to surprise him with a visit."

01:03:10.916 --> 01:03:12.208
-No!
-Okay, no.

01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:35.041
-Hi!
-Hi!

01:03:35.125 --> 01:03:36.500
-How are you?
-Great.

01:03:36.583 --> 01:03:38.000
Ori, what a pleasure!

01:03:39.291 --> 01:03:40.708
Auntie Laia!

01:03:41.333 --> 01:03:42.875
-What's up, kids?
-For you.

01:03:42.958 --> 01:03:43.791
How are you?

01:03:43.875 --> 01:03:45.458
-Come play with us!
-Yes, please!

01:03:45.541 --> 01:03:47.666
Okay. I'll leave you to talk, okay?

01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:48.708
-Yes.
-Come on.

01:03:51.041 --> 01:03:51.875
Shall we?

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:04.958
What are you trying to prove?

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:07.791
That you can get to my family
using this freak?

01:04:07.875 --> 01:04:11.458
Honestly, I was thinking
of something less conventional.

01:04:11.541 --> 01:04:14.208
A toxic relationship with a young woman.

01:04:14.291 --> 01:04:16.166
Juan Pablo's ex-girlfriend, actually.

01:04:16.666 --> 01:04:18.500
But you can't trust these people.

01:04:18.583 --> 01:04:20.625
-Academic types.
-Morons.

01:04:22.333 --> 01:04:23.625
Turn that shit off.

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:25.916
Exactly.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.958
In Mexico, we call them assholes.

01:04:28.625 --> 01:04:30.250
You know what's funny, Ori?

01:04:30.791 --> 01:04:32.708
You dragged Laia into this.

01:04:33.333 --> 01:04:36.166
You asked me to watch her
in Playa del Carmen, remember?

01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:37.083
What was it?

01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:40.458
-Were you afraid she'd be kidnapped?
-Is that a threat?

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.416
We're in your home,

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:46.208
sitting next to a scabby moron
who looks like an infected anus.

01:04:46.791 --> 01:04:48.041
That's the real threat.

01:04:48.875 --> 01:04:50.916
All I want right now is whiskey.

01:04:52.416 --> 01:04:53.833
Let's have a whiskey.

01:04:54.333 --> 01:04:58.375
You have until I finish my drink
to explain what the hell you want from me,

01:04:58.458 --> 01:05:01.583
and it better be interesting,
or I'll call the Mozos.

01:05:02.291 --> 01:05:06.166
You know very well
that in this country, unlike yours,

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:08.083
the justice system still works.

01:05:09.708 --> 01:05:11.583
That's the Ori I know.

01:05:11.666 --> 01:05:13.333
Always telling jokes.

01:05:14.125 --> 01:05:14.958
Fuck off.

01:05:34.708 --> 01:05:35.541
Hello?

01:05:35.625 --> 01:05:37.541
I saw you called me. Are you okay?

01:05:37.625 --> 01:05:38.833
Why are you whispering?

01:05:39.333 --> 01:05:40.375
What's up?

01:05:40.458 --> 01:05:42.666
What's with the 50 euros in the coat?

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:44.250
You said you had no money.

01:05:44.333 --> 01:05:47.583
So? Are you gonna give me money
every time I need it?

01:05:47.666 --> 01:05:49.958
Is that your way
of clearing your conscience?

01:05:50.041 --> 01:05:51.958
No, but I can help you change your flight.

01:05:52.041 --> 01:05:54.833
I'm not leaving,
even if you can't wait for me to go!

01:05:55.541 --> 01:05:56.375
Vale?

01:06:01.916 --> 01:06:03.083
Everything okay?

01:06:03.166 --> 01:06:04.000
Yeah.

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:36.500
Jimi, remember that thing
you offered to do?

01:06:37.875 --> 01:06:39.083
I think, yeah.

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:41.083
Do it.

01:06:51.875 --> 01:06:53.791
Son, make the most of being there.

01:06:53.875 --> 01:06:56.583
Find yourself a nice girl,
someone worthy of you.

01:06:56.666 --> 01:06:58.750
A classy European girl.

01:06:58.833 --> 01:07:02.333
Son, forgive me, but just think
where you would've ended up

01:07:02.416 --> 01:07:03.875
if you'd stayed with Valentina.

01:07:03.958 --> 01:07:08.250
Teaching in a middle school in Pachuca
or living in social housing?

01:07:08.333 --> 01:07:09.625
Think about it. It's true…

01:07:09.708 --> 01:07:12.458
Turn that shit off.
No wonder you're so thick.

01:07:18.291 --> 01:07:19.666
Bring him in, Chucky.

01:07:26.875 --> 01:07:27.708
Got a light?

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:35.541
Hey.

01:07:35.625 --> 01:07:37.125
We met the other day.

01:07:37.208 --> 01:07:39.583
Is that contagious?

01:07:40.125 --> 01:07:41.166
Silence, damn it.

01:07:42.833 --> 01:07:44.041
He might have leprosy.

01:07:44.125 --> 01:07:46.625
Please! We're not in your fucking country.

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:01.791
This jerk is the asshole

01:08:01.875 --> 01:08:05.875
that the family of this other asshole's
new girlfriend sent to watch him.

01:08:05.958 --> 01:08:07.875
Piece of shit immigrants!

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.208
Any last words?

01:08:10.708 --> 01:08:13.208
Leave the dog alone. It's not her fault.

01:08:13.291 --> 01:08:14.541
What dog, Chucky?

01:08:14.625 --> 01:08:16.083
She's tied up outside.

01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:21.583
Take this.

01:08:22.625 --> 01:08:23.458
Chino.

01:08:30.958 --> 01:08:32.500
-Go on.
-Fucking take it.

01:08:34.666 --> 01:08:37.666
We need you to prove
your commitment to the project.

01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:41.125
I don't even know what the project is.

01:08:41.625 --> 01:08:43.083
Nothing too crazy.

01:08:43.166 --> 01:08:46.958
-We want your girlfriend's father to--
-He knows enough, asshole.

01:08:47.875 --> 01:08:49.375
What do you want then?

01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:53.625
For us to send the sadistic team
to Mom and Dad at Jacarandas 32?

01:08:53.708 --> 01:08:57.166
What they did to your cousin
was nothing compared to--

01:08:59.333 --> 01:09:00.708
That's enough!

01:09:03.375 --> 01:09:05.458
You're tough after all, pretty boy.

01:09:33.083 --> 01:09:35.083
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE

01:09:45.708 --> 01:09:47.625
Stupid asshole!

01:09:53.375 --> 01:09:57.083
-Hello?
-The deal was 15, but Chino brought me 87.

01:09:57.166 --> 01:09:59.333
-Who's this?
-Don't mess with me, moron.

01:09:59.416 --> 01:10:00.833
That's not how things are done.

01:10:00.916 --> 01:10:04.500
Tell your boss we can't move that much
without Interpol coming after us.

01:10:04.583 --> 01:10:05.500
I won't do it.

01:10:06.666 --> 01:10:08.208
Juan Pablo Villalobos?

01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:09.541
I know what you did!

01:10:40.333 --> 01:10:41.666
The horror of the world.

01:10:43.208 --> 01:10:44.875
The empty stare of the dead.

01:11:11.666 --> 01:11:13.041
The horror of the world.

01:11:13.541 --> 01:11:16.708
The empty stare of the dead.
A stare that forced me…

01:11:21.625 --> 01:11:23.333
The horror of the world.

01:11:23.416 --> 01:11:25.416
The empty stare of the dead.

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:26.416
A stare that…

01:11:29.208 --> 01:11:30.500
A stare that…

01:11:33.125 --> 01:11:35.250
left me speechless and forced me to write.

01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:52.875
There was once a Mexican,
a Chinese man, and a Muslim

01:11:52.958 --> 01:11:56.916
in a meeting with some Mexican gangsters
at an abandoned warehouse in Barcelona.

01:11:59.041 --> 01:12:01.250
Except the Muslim wasn't exactly a Muslim.

01:12:02.125 --> 01:12:03.541
He was an atheist Pakistani.

01:12:03.625 --> 01:12:04.791
Kill her.

01:12:04.875 --> 01:12:05.791
Honestly,

01:12:06.583 --> 01:12:09.375
none of them knew exactly
how the business worked.

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:13.583
The Mexican, especially,
didn't understand anything.

01:12:16.083 --> 01:12:17.958
Are you watching porn, man?

01:12:18.458 --> 01:12:19.541
Come on, man.

01:12:19.625 --> 01:12:21.958
Put headphones in
and shut the door. The kid's here.

01:12:22.041 --> 01:12:22.875
Yeah.

01:12:23.375 --> 01:12:27.583
She's staying a few weeks, by the way.
Her mom had to go to Argentina urgently.

01:12:27.666 --> 01:12:30.250
"We had to write for no one."

01:12:30.333 --> 01:12:32.625
-What did she say?
-Poetry, man.

01:12:35.291 --> 01:12:39.083
"There is no silence here.
Only the sentences you avoid hearing."

01:12:55.583 --> 01:12:58.208
Juan Pablo Villalobos
constructs in his novel

01:12:58.291 --> 01:13:01.500
a unique world
full of endearing and eccentric characters

01:13:01.583 --> 01:13:04.583
who are put into strange,
highly amusing situations.

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.583
Through the odyssey of a normal man,

01:13:07.666 --> 01:13:10.708
who finds himself involved
in the most bizarre adventures,

01:13:10.791 --> 01:13:13.750
Villalobos has found
a tone and rhythm of his own

01:13:13.833 --> 01:13:17.083
unlike any other
in contemporary Mexican literature.

01:13:17.583 --> 01:13:19.250
He draws laughter from absurdity.

01:13:19.333 --> 01:13:21.833
And in doing so,
reveals the nonsense of the world.

01:13:22.333 --> 01:13:25.208
By unanimous decision,
this year's Best Novel Award

01:13:25.291 --> 01:13:27.666
goes to the work
of this promising young man.

01:13:28.166 --> 01:13:30.166
A round of applause
for Juan Pablo Villalobos

01:13:30.250 --> 01:13:33.666
and his novel entitled
I Don't Expect Anyone to Believe Me.

01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:36.000
HERRALDE LITERARY AWARD

01:13:36.083 --> 01:13:38.875
Presenting the award, Mr. Jorge Herralde.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.875
Congratulations. If you please…

01:13:53.875 --> 01:13:55.958
The situation determines everything.

01:13:56.041 --> 01:13:58.583
Of course, he did the work,
but we can't deny

01:13:58.666 --> 01:14:02.208
that the sheer scale of the events
was a great source of inspiration.

01:14:07.083 --> 01:14:09.250
People don't like
to speak ill of the dead,

01:14:09.333 --> 01:14:11.916
but some dead people
don't stop making trouble.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.708
Cuz! Shithead.

01:14:13.791 --> 01:14:15.791
Shoot. Just shoot.

01:14:55.666 --> 01:14:59.750
I write without guilt,
without shame, as a release, with an itch.

01:15:00.791 --> 01:15:02.250
I don't write to say sorry.

01:15:02.333 --> 01:15:06.000
I write because, in the end, I'm a cynic
who only wants to write a novel.

01:15:06.083 --> 01:15:07.750
One like those I like to read.

01:15:07.833 --> 01:15:10.708
The only reason
I haven't jumped out my window yet

01:15:10.791 --> 01:15:12.500
is that I have to finish this novel.

01:15:13.083 --> 01:15:14.625
I have to make it to the end.

01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:18.916
And though I exaggerate a bit,
everything in the novel is true.

01:15:19.541 --> 01:15:20.791
I can prove it.

01:15:20.875 --> 01:15:24.625
I don't expect anyone to believe me,
and I won't go to the police either.

01:15:50.791 --> 01:15:51.625
Let's go.

01:15:53.250 --> 01:15:54.916
Are you sure he was Italian?

01:15:55.833 --> 01:15:56.666
I'd say so.

01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:00.333
Fucking Italians,
they want to fuck up our plans.

01:16:00.833 --> 01:16:03.333
How long have you been working
for The Graduate?

01:16:03.416 --> 01:16:05.500
I just came to Barcelona to do a PhD.

01:16:06.625 --> 01:16:08.833
All we need now is for the National Police

01:16:08.916 --> 01:16:13.291
to start issuing
student residence cards to offenders.

01:16:13.833 --> 01:16:16.625
I wouldn't be surprised.
They're such morons.

01:16:19.333 --> 01:16:20.458
See you next week.

01:16:20.958 --> 01:16:23.375
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year, García.

01:16:24.625 --> 01:16:25.666
Relax.

01:16:26.333 --> 01:16:28.166
You're among friends.

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:30.666
You think you'd be here
if that weren't the case?

01:16:31.791 --> 01:16:33.916
Fuck those Italians.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.375
They think Barcelona is a sewer

01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:39.833
where they can dump
all their anti-establishment bullshit.

01:16:40.916 --> 01:16:41.791
That's him.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.625
Free yourself, sister.

01:16:44.708 --> 01:16:48.625
From Juan Pablo and the fucking euro.
Come home. We'll pamper you.

01:16:50.458 --> 01:16:51.791
What's up, Nayelson?

01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:55.833
I just wanted to wish you
a Happy New Year.

01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:58.458
I'm at a new job.

01:16:58.541 --> 01:17:01.166
-So I'll call you later.
-Take his coffee.

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:02.583
I love you.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.500
-Hey.
-What's up?

01:17:21.583 --> 01:17:23.750
-Are you leaving?
-Yeah. We're running late.

01:17:28.458 --> 01:17:29.291
Bye.

01:17:30.833 --> 01:17:32.750
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

01:18:36.041 --> 01:18:38.125
Jesus! What happened to your face?

01:18:38.708 --> 01:18:41.250
I'm allergic to smoke.

01:18:41.333 --> 01:18:42.166
I see.

01:18:42.708 --> 01:18:44.625
-Can I ask you a question?
-Yeah.

01:18:45.583 --> 01:18:49.208
I don't want to devalue
your connection with Laia, really.

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:52.541
But are you comfortable with all this?
You're not, are you?

01:18:53.041 --> 01:18:54.500
I don't want to pry, you know.

01:18:55.416 --> 01:18:57.375
But maybe you're a whim of hers.

01:18:57.458 --> 01:19:00.791
Laia Carbonell questions everything,
analyzes everything.

01:19:00.875 --> 01:19:02.666
She even questions what she questions.

01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:06.083
You're a fucking project.
Don't you realize, honey?

01:19:07.708 --> 01:19:09.500
Okay, Mexican?

01:19:09.583 --> 01:19:11.166
-You're in a daze, sweetie.
-Sorry.

01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:14.208
I have to call my family in Guadalajara.
I'll be right back.

01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:23.750
What's up, bro?

01:19:23.833 --> 01:19:27.375
You like the pills?
Want to ring in the new year with a bang?

01:19:27.458 --> 01:19:30.250
Yeah, listen… Do you have a dog?

01:19:30.333 --> 01:19:33.041
"Dog"? I have the usual. What dog?

01:19:33.541 --> 01:19:34.625
No, I mean,

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.208
I need a vet urgently.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.833
Bro, don't tell me your dog ate a pill.

01:19:40.916 --> 01:19:42.041
Do you know anyone?

01:19:42.791 --> 01:19:46.708
It'll cost you. Bring money.
It's a holiday. It's expensive.

01:19:46.791 --> 01:19:48.666
I told you they were strong.

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:49.750
Yeah, yeah.

01:19:50.416 --> 01:19:51.291
All right.

01:19:58.458 --> 01:19:59.291
Yeah?

01:19:59.375 --> 01:20:01.750
Chino, do you have Ahmed's phone number?

01:20:02.333 --> 01:20:04.583
It's just, what if the dog has a chip?

01:20:06.625 --> 01:20:09.250
DAD
WHATSAPP VIDEO CALL

01:20:22.625 --> 01:20:23.666
Okay.

01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:26.375
You win, stupid fucking city. I'm leaving.

01:20:49.291 --> 01:20:51.083
A Gypsy and a Moor walk into a bar.

01:20:51.166 --> 01:20:53.125
They order coffee
from the Spanish waitress,

01:20:53.208 --> 01:20:56.333
and when she turns around,
the Gypsy says to the Moor,

01:20:56.416 --> 01:20:59.708
"Check this out." He takes a cupcake
and puts it in his pocket.

01:20:59.791 --> 01:21:02.375
The Gypsy says,
"That's nothing. Watch and learn."

01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:05.000
He calls over the Spanish waitress.
"Come here!"

01:21:05.083 --> 01:21:07.916
"Come here. I'll show you a magic trick."

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.791
She doesn't say anything.

01:21:09.875 --> 01:21:12.750
The Gypsy takes a cupcake
and eats it in one go.

01:21:12.833 --> 01:21:15.083
The waitress says, "Where's the magic?"

01:21:15.583 --> 01:21:18.000
"Check out the Moor's pocket,"
says the Gypsy.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.250
It's not Moor. It's Maghrebi.

01:21:22.333 --> 01:21:24.791
It's always been "fucking Moor"
where I'm from.

01:21:24.875 --> 01:21:27.458
You just don't get it
because you're foreigners.

01:21:27.958 --> 01:21:29.166
It's not fucking funny.

01:21:29.250 --> 01:21:31.208
And it perpetuates the stereotype

01:21:31.291 --> 01:21:33.958
that Maghrebis
and the Romani people are thieves.

01:21:34.041 --> 01:21:37.291
"The Romani people"?
Where did you find these guys?

01:21:37.375 --> 01:21:38.958
Anyway, it's demeaning.

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:44.083
Dude, it's a fucking joke
that you guys reminded me of.

01:21:44.166 --> 01:21:46.583
You guys look like the set-up of a joke.

01:21:46.666 --> 01:21:49.166
A Mexican, a Muslim, and a Chinese man.

01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:51.083
I'm not Muslim. I'm an atheist.

01:21:51.166 --> 01:21:53.500
The worst part
is that the waitress is Spanish.

01:21:53.583 --> 01:21:56.750
You're implying immigrants come here
to steal from the Spanish.

01:21:57.875 --> 01:22:00.208
-Here's the code for--
-Let's see.

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:03.333
Will the search leave a trace?

01:22:03.416 --> 01:22:05.625
Are you stupid, man? Write down the code.

01:22:05.708 --> 01:22:07.583
What? Why?

01:22:07.666 --> 01:22:10.791
You're going to let that prick
get his way? Then what?

01:22:10.875 --> 01:22:13.375
-And Ugo has become fond of you.
-Ugo?

01:22:20.875 --> 01:22:21.708
Come here.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.791
-Vale.
-I'll miss you too, Jimi.

01:22:38.541 --> 01:22:39.541
Giuseppe Savardi?

01:22:40.083 --> 01:22:41.166
Papers, please.

01:22:41.875 --> 01:22:44.250
-What?
-Papers, please.

01:22:46.041 --> 01:22:46.916
Fuck.

01:22:53.416 --> 01:22:54.333
Here you go.

01:22:57.916 --> 01:22:58.750
What a change!

01:23:03.250 --> 01:23:04.458
Papers.

01:23:04.541 --> 01:23:06.541
-Me?
-No, the bottle.

01:23:11.333 --> 01:23:13.500
-I left it at home.
-Where are you from?

01:23:13.583 --> 01:23:15.083
You don't have to answer.

01:23:16.083 --> 01:23:18.541
-I'm from Mexico.
-Do you live in Barcelona?

01:23:19.041 --> 01:23:21.666
Yes, but I'm going back
to Mexico next week.

01:23:23.375 --> 01:23:25.958
She's Mexican
but she's not carrying any papers.

01:23:26.041 --> 01:23:28.500
-Are you registered?
-Yes, I think so.

01:23:28.583 --> 01:23:29.708
At which address?

01:23:29.791 --> 01:23:32.625
2 Jules Verne Street,
but I don't live there anymore.

01:23:35.541 --> 01:23:36.458
Here, Giuseppe.

01:23:37.041 --> 01:23:39.916
There's the date, time,
and place of your hearing.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.333
I suggest you show up.

01:23:41.416 --> 01:23:43.833
You haven't even told me what it's about.

01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:47.708
I know your ways.
You think I'm scared of you?

01:23:47.791 --> 01:23:49.458
It's a fascist trick to intimidate--

01:23:49.541 --> 01:23:52.291
You've been reported
for a threat made on December 28th.

01:23:52.375 --> 01:23:54.708
Right at the address
your girlfriend mentioned.

01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:56.708
Where do you live now?

01:23:57.833 --> 01:23:59.000
Where do you live now?

01:23:59.083 --> 01:24:01.708
Don't answer. I know the law.

01:24:01.791 --> 01:24:05.250
Besides, I was here that night.
I have a ton of witnesses.

01:24:05.333 --> 01:24:07.750
Shut your mouth or you're coming with us.

01:24:08.791 --> 01:24:11.583
We have to verify your current address.
Come with us.

01:24:11.666 --> 01:24:14.416
One moment, please. I know my rights.

01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:17.958
Jimi, what the hell? Please tell me
you didn't do anything to Juan Pablo.

01:24:18.041 --> 01:24:19.500
I only did what you asked.

01:24:19.583 --> 01:24:21.916
Who the fuck files a report
over a shove? Dude.

01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:26.166
I'm the only one on your side.
Don't turn against me.

01:24:26.250 --> 01:24:28.500
And you know what?
He bought the same coat!

01:24:28.583 --> 01:24:31.750
And he's ugly with that rash on his face.
Don't regret it.

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:34.041
-I do regret it. Now I'm in trouble.
-Move.

01:24:35.125 --> 01:24:37.166
-Hold on.
-I don't know what you did.

01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:39.333
Are you that scared of the Mozos?

01:24:39.416 --> 01:24:41.583
Call yourself Mexican?
You don't deserve Zapata!

01:24:41.666 --> 01:24:45.125
-You should've told me.
-Isn't it strange they found me here?

01:24:45.208 --> 01:24:46.916
-Want me to come with you?
-No.

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:51.208
You're fascists! You're bothering
my friend because she's Latina.

01:24:51.291 --> 01:24:54.416
You plundered America's gold
and now gripe about immigration.

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:56.458
Fucking Nazis. Look at them.

01:25:08.666 --> 01:25:10.333
My things are in my bedroom.

01:25:11.416 --> 01:25:12.250
This way.

01:25:32.375 --> 01:25:34.333
Listen, for the moment,
there's no problem.

01:25:34.416 --> 01:25:38.041
Giuseppe's court date is in March,
and you'll be in Mexico by then.

01:25:38.125 --> 01:25:41.666
But you should still do
the consular registration.

01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:43.458
It seems like dumb jealousy

01:25:43.541 --> 01:25:46.125
until some idiot snaps and tragedy ensues.

01:25:46.625 --> 01:25:47.875
I've seen it many times.

01:25:48.458 --> 01:25:52.125
I know it sounds dumb, and no one wants
to go to the police until it's too late.

01:25:55.333 --> 01:25:57.625
-No, it's not that. It's--
-Give it to me.

01:25:57.708 --> 01:25:58.916
-What?
-The card.

01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:04.125
I'll give you my number.

01:26:14.791 --> 01:26:15.625
Laia?

01:26:16.125 --> 01:26:17.000
That's my name.

01:26:21.458 --> 01:26:22.375
Thank you.

01:26:29.333 --> 01:26:30.208
I found it.

01:26:30.291 --> 01:26:31.666
Her name is Viridiana.

01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:34.000
She's registered with Perea Carbonell.

01:26:34.541 --> 01:26:36.291
Holy shit. A relative of Laia's.

01:26:36.375 --> 01:26:37.333
Who's Laia?

01:26:38.208 --> 01:26:40.708
-Oriol's daughter.
-Well, the chip is deactivated.

01:26:40.791 --> 01:26:43.333
-We have to tell The Graduate.
-What for?

01:26:43.416 --> 01:26:45.083
He said only if it's urgent.

01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:47.750
Chino, call The Graduate.

01:26:48.250 --> 01:26:49.791
-No.
-Come on, Chino.

01:26:50.291 --> 01:26:52.166
You left and let him keep the dog.

01:26:53.916 --> 01:26:57.125
-Ahmed should call him.
-I don't even work for The Graduate.

01:26:57.208 --> 01:26:59.833
-You don't?
-I work for The Graduate's boss.

01:27:00.541 --> 01:27:02.125
Call him yourself if you want.

01:27:03.583 --> 01:27:06.250
You can only put your thumb up or down.

01:27:06.333 --> 01:27:09.666
Okay? Only once I've said, "Odd one out."

01:27:10.416 --> 01:27:12.041
Whoever's the odd one out

01:27:12.541 --> 01:27:14.083
has to call The Graduate.

01:27:14.166 --> 01:27:15.500
Let's do a practice one.

01:27:15.583 --> 01:27:16.791
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:27:17.541 --> 01:27:20.416
One, two, three. Odd one--

01:27:28.125 --> 01:27:28.958
Hello?

01:27:30.083 --> 01:27:30.916
Understood.

01:27:31.916 --> 01:27:33.625
Yes, I can do that.

01:27:41.125 --> 01:27:42.291
I'll think of something.

01:27:42.791 --> 01:27:43.666
Yes.

01:27:46.750 --> 01:27:49.291
-Who was that?
-It was The Graduate.

01:27:49.375 --> 01:27:50.333
What did he say?

01:27:50.875 --> 01:27:55.125
He asked me to find more information
to put more pressure on Oriol.

01:27:55.208 --> 01:27:59.458
He said it was too soon to mail him
an ear or a finger from the dead guy.

01:28:00.083 --> 01:28:04.041
Also, he knows the dog is here.
You should leave. I have work to do.

01:28:04.833 --> 01:28:06.375
Ivonne and I need to rest.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:07.833
Ivonne?

01:28:08.375 --> 01:28:10.750
The Graduate told me to change her name.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:12.958
I'm heading out.

01:28:23.958 --> 01:28:24.791
Hey, man.

01:28:25.833 --> 01:28:27.000
Please leave.

01:28:27.666 --> 01:28:34.208
THEY DON'T NEED US ANYMORE,
THEY HAVE WHAT THEY WANTED NOW.

01:28:34.291 --> 01:28:41.291
IF I WANT TO SAVE VALENTINA
AND FINISH MY NOVEL,

01:28:41.375 --> 01:28:47.625
I'LL HAVE TO GO TALK TO THE GRADUATE.

01:29:11.083 --> 01:29:11.916
Who is it?

01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:16.333
-It's the brunette, Dad.
-What's up?

01:29:16.416 --> 01:29:18.708
-Hi. I'm looking for Juan Pablo.
-Listen, dude.

01:29:18.791 --> 01:29:21.500
It's two boxes.
Don't bust my balls right now.

01:29:21.583 --> 01:29:23.583
Tell him I'll give him a freebie later.

01:29:23.666 --> 01:29:25.416
-Hello.
-Hi, Ale. How are you?

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:29.041
Bad. My mom went to Argentina,
and my dad can't take care of me.

01:29:29.125 --> 01:29:32.541
Come on. Give me a break.
She's mad I can't stay with her.

01:29:33.041 --> 01:29:34.541
Have you seen Juan Pablo?

01:29:34.625 --> 01:29:37.041
No, he's probably with Laia.
Have you called him?

01:29:37.125 --> 01:29:39.958
The brunette can look after me!

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:42.833
Stop it. You have a sitter.
What will I say to Pilar?

01:29:42.916 --> 01:29:46.583
I don't like Pilar. She's stupid.
I want the brunette to watch me.

01:29:46.666 --> 01:29:48.125
Listen, Vale.

01:29:48.625 --> 01:29:52.208
Would you stay with her this afternoon?
I can pay you seven euros an hour.

01:29:52.291 --> 01:29:55.666
Since her mom left, she's been difficult.
Even the sitter can't stand her.

01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:57.416
But it's different with you.

01:29:57.500 --> 01:30:00.625
It'd be weird
if Juan Pablo gets back, and I'm here.

01:30:00.708 --> 01:30:04.708
You won't see Juan Pablo.
He's a ghost. He barely lives here.

01:30:04.791 --> 01:30:06.000
I'll be back first.

01:30:06.083 --> 01:30:11.458
You go to the park, come back, hang out,
give her a shower, and I'll be back.

01:30:11.541 --> 01:30:13.166
What do you say? Ten euros.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.666
An hour. Is it a deal?

01:30:16.708 --> 01:30:20.250
Is this about the other day?
Do you want me to apologize?

01:30:20.833 --> 01:30:24.875
Is that it? Okay, I'm sorry, Valentina.
I fucked up. There we go.

01:30:24.958 --> 01:30:28.750
Come on. Let's turn the page.
Anyway, you could take it as a compliment.

01:30:28.833 --> 01:30:31.708
No, Facundo. Don't make it worse.

01:30:32.875 --> 01:30:35.125
Honestly, I need the money.

01:30:35.208 --> 01:30:36.291
I'll stay.

01:30:36.375 --> 01:30:39.208
Charly, don't worry.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

01:30:39.291 --> 01:30:41.500
You'll have to blow me
until tomorrow morning.

01:30:42.041 --> 01:30:42.875
Come in.

01:30:56.375 --> 01:30:57.583
VALENTINA
I'M LEAVING

01:30:57.666 --> 01:31:01.458
I'M GOING BACK TO MEXICO,
I WANT TO SEE YOU, WE NEED TO TALK.

01:31:08.666 --> 01:31:09.750
IT'S FOR THE BEST,

01:31:09.833 --> 01:31:12.666
LET ME KNOW
IF YOU NEED ME TO CHANGE YOUR FLIGHT.

01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:16.250
I CAN DO IT, OR TRANSFER YOU THE MONEY.

01:31:20.125 --> 01:31:23.791
They found the Italian guy.
Guess who he was with?

01:31:24.916 --> 01:31:27.458
You shouldn't have
broken up with Valentina.

01:31:28.583 --> 01:31:30.416
The detective was Laia's uncle.

01:31:31.166 --> 01:31:35.000
Do you think I'm stupid enough
to get an asshole to kill another asshole

01:31:35.083 --> 01:31:36.416
without knowing who he is?

01:31:37.791 --> 01:31:40.916
No, but you said
the family had hired him--

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.083
I told you the family had sent him,

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.500
not that they had hired him.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
But I was wrong.

01:31:47.583 --> 01:31:49.291
Fucking European bourgeoisie.

01:31:49.958 --> 01:31:52.916
Two shocks on his balls,
and he spilled the beans.

01:31:54.333 --> 01:31:56.958
He thought you wanted
to use Laia for residency.

01:31:58.750 --> 01:32:02.458
What if the family
reports that he's gone missing?

01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:06.375
Who do you think
you're working for, dumbass?

01:32:06.875 --> 01:32:10.250
We have his cell phone.
We're using it to text his family.

01:32:15.625 --> 01:32:18.166
You shouldn't have
broken up with Valentina.

01:32:21.041 --> 01:32:22.416
I told you.

01:32:24.208 --> 01:32:26.166
I didn't want it to come to this.

01:32:26.708 --> 01:32:27.875
I like Valentina.

01:32:28.583 --> 01:32:30.708
I like people who come from nothing.

01:32:31.250 --> 01:32:33.000
But there's no other way.

01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:37.041
You shouldn't have let her go. I told you.

01:32:40.291 --> 01:32:43.750
"…transfer you the money."
Come and face me, asshole.

01:32:46.583 --> 01:32:47.416
Ale!

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.125
Ale!

01:32:49.208 --> 01:32:51.750
-Ale! Come here.
-What?

01:32:51.833 --> 01:32:55.416
You mustn't throw sand at them.
It'll go in their eyes.

01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:57.708
-They started it.
-Shall I call Pilar?

01:32:57.791 --> 01:33:00.250
-No.
-So apologize, and we'll leave.

01:33:00.333 --> 01:33:01.708
Let's just leave.

01:33:07.666 --> 01:33:08.750
Buttheads!

01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:11.000
-Hey.
-What?

01:33:11.083 --> 01:33:12.833
While the rose water dries,

01:33:13.375 --> 01:33:14.208
the roller.

01:33:14.291 --> 01:33:17.125
I like to roll it over the same spots
as the gua sha stone.

01:33:17.208 --> 01:33:18.416
JUAN PABLO
WHATSAPP AUDIO

01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:20.208
Always roll outwards.

01:33:20.291 --> 01:33:22.208
This is one of my favorite questions…

01:33:22.291 --> 01:33:23.125
Ale!

01:33:24.250 --> 01:33:25.083
DAD
WHATSAPP AUDIO

01:33:25.166 --> 01:33:26.250
Bath is almost ready.

01:33:27.166 --> 01:33:29.791
Let me see. I have to answer this.

01:33:30.958 --> 01:33:31.791
Hi, Dad!

01:33:33.125 --> 01:33:35.750
Good, I'm looking after
my friend's daughter.

01:33:38.583 --> 01:33:42.541
I think so. I'll call the airline now
and call you back, okay?

01:33:44.375 --> 01:33:45.791
Okay, Dad. Bye!

01:33:47.625 --> 01:33:48.458
Ale?

01:33:50.041 --> 01:33:53.083
-Ale, what are you doing?
-Welcome to Aeroméxico.

01:33:53.166 --> 01:33:56.625
If you would like
to talk to an agent, press 1.

01:33:56.708 --> 01:33:58.166
Talk to an agent.

01:33:59.166 --> 01:34:01.916
Aeroméxico, hello. My name is Margarita.
How can I help you?

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.125
Hello, Margarita.

01:34:03.208 --> 01:34:06.833
I'm on a waiting list for a flight,
Barcelona-Mexico, on Thursday.

01:34:06.916 --> 01:34:10.541
-I wanted to know if there's a space, or--
-Do you have a reservation code?

01:34:10.625 --> 01:34:12.750
-Yes, one moment.
-Dad took the tablet.

01:34:12.833 --> 01:34:14.666
I want to keep watching the video!

01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:18.125
Ale, I'll just finish this call,
and you can use my phone.

01:34:18.625 --> 01:34:22.458
The code is L-F-P-P-7-1.

01:34:22.541 --> 01:34:24.375
-Please hold.
-Ale!

01:34:25.166 --> 01:34:27.708
The flight is Thursday,
January 11th, right?

01:34:27.791 --> 01:34:30.083
Yes, or an earlier one
if it isn't much more.

01:34:30.166 --> 01:34:32.208
-Put in the code.
-This is Juan Pablo's room.

01:34:32.291 --> 01:34:34.625
-Put in the code.
-You can't come in here. Come.

01:34:35.125 --> 01:34:37.916
Put in the code,
or I'll tell my dad you hit me!

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.458
I didn't hit you, Ale!

01:34:40.083 --> 01:34:41.583
One second, please.

01:34:44.333 --> 01:34:45.958
Come on, get out of here.

01:34:46.041 --> 01:34:49.125
You can't go into places
that aren't yours, Ale!

01:34:51.041 --> 01:34:55.500
Margarita, I'm still here.
Can you reserve me a seat?

01:34:55.583 --> 01:34:59.125
No, unfortunately not.
Can I help you with anything else?

01:34:59.208 --> 01:35:00.708
No, thanks, Margarita.

01:35:00.791 --> 01:35:03.708
-Thank you for calling Aeroméxico…
-Fuck!

01:35:03.791 --> 01:35:05.916
Fuck! You're kidding me.

01:35:08.875 --> 01:35:09.958
Goddammit.

01:35:10.541 --> 01:35:15.208
What's up, cuz?
Tell me you didn't get this fucking video.

01:35:15.291 --> 01:35:18.333
-What's that?
-I don't know. It started on its own.

01:35:18.416 --> 01:35:20.041
-What did you do?
-Nothing!

01:35:20.125 --> 01:35:22.541
There was a banner up here,
and I clicked on it.

01:35:22.625 --> 01:35:23.875
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:35:23.958 --> 01:35:27.333
You'll meet the project partners,
and everything will be great.

01:35:27.833 --> 01:35:29.166
-I'm just…
-What?

01:35:29.250 --> 01:35:34.125
…scheduling this to send later
just in case those assholes kill me.

01:35:35.250 --> 01:35:37.416
Leave it on! I like how he talks.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.916
Ale, let's take a bath,
and then we'll do whatever you want.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.208
-We can put makeup on, okay?
-Okay.

01:35:45.291 --> 01:35:48.125
But only ten minutes,
and then you do my makeup.

01:35:48.791 --> 01:35:50.375
Yes, I promise.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.666
How did I die? Knowing those assholes,
I bet I was run over, right?

01:35:59.750 --> 01:36:01.958
That's how those assholes always do it.

01:36:03.208 --> 01:36:06.000
Juan Pablo, it's Valentina.
Call me, please.

01:36:06.083 --> 01:36:08.416
I just saw a video
your dead cousin sent you.

01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:11.708
I'm at your house.
I don't understand. Call me.

01:36:17.375 --> 01:36:18.625
-Juan Pablo!
-Vale!

01:36:19.125 --> 01:36:21.458
-Where are you? Listen.
-I'm in your house.

01:36:21.541 --> 01:36:24.041
What's with the video
your cousin sent you?

01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:27.625
Juan Pablo?

01:36:30.791 --> 01:36:32.458
Juan Pablo, what's going on?

01:36:32.541 --> 01:36:33.541
Juan Pablo?

01:36:51.166 --> 01:36:52.000
Yes?

01:36:55.291 --> 01:36:57.666
-Sorry, I rang the wrong doorbell.
-Okay.

01:37:25.541 --> 01:37:26.625
Vale.

01:37:26.708 --> 01:37:29.250
Stay where you are,
and don't open the door. Do as I say.

01:37:29.333 --> 01:37:31.333
I'm coming. I'll explain everything.

01:37:40.208 --> 01:37:43.333
Vale, stay where you are,
and don't open the door.

01:37:43.833 --> 01:37:47.000
Do as I say. I'm coming.
I'll explain everything.

01:37:48.208 --> 01:37:51.250
I'm just sending this scheduled email

01:37:51.333 --> 01:37:55.083
because I'm prudent,
and you have to be in business, Juanpis.

01:37:55.166 --> 01:37:57.875
You have to think
of all the fucking variables.

01:37:58.583 --> 01:38:01.916
If those assholes killed me,
they can't get away with it.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.416
So pay close attention
to everything I'm going to tell you.

01:38:05.916 --> 01:38:08.875
Look, about two years ago,

01:38:08.958 --> 01:38:12.125
I met two Catalan chicks in Cancún.

01:38:12.208 --> 01:38:16.875
To be honest, I wanted
to fuck one of them, but guess what?

01:38:16.958 --> 01:38:18.791
She turned out to be a lesbian.

01:38:19.875 --> 01:38:23.958
My instinct told me to treat them right.

01:38:24.875 --> 01:38:26.666
So I started investigating,

01:38:27.208 --> 01:38:31.666
and I found out that one of them,
Laia is her name, Laia Carbonell,

01:38:32.166 --> 01:38:35.291
is the daughter of a Catalan politician.
A real big shot.

01:38:36.333 --> 01:38:41.291
No one in Catalonia dares to fart
without this prick's permission.

01:38:44.041 --> 01:38:47.791
Damn it, cuz.
Tell me you didn't get this fucking video.

01:38:49.125 --> 01:38:51.125
But you know what? I can sense it.

01:38:51.208 --> 01:38:54.833
I can sense that that fucker,
The Graduate, wants to kill me.

01:38:54.916 --> 01:38:59.125
He wants to kill me
all because of a project that went slowly.

01:38:59.208 --> 01:39:03.375
It was slow, but we were barely
in the start-up phase. Come on.

01:39:05.291 --> 01:39:08.916
If those assholes try to get you too,
you'd better listen up.

01:39:09.416 --> 01:39:13.458
Don't even think about going to the police
because those bastards control them too.

01:39:14.875 --> 01:39:18.375
No, the key here
is the guy they call Chucky.

01:39:19.125 --> 01:39:20.500
Chucky, shithead.

01:39:20.583 --> 01:39:23.083
You'll meet him tomorrow. He's a good guy.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.041
My instinct also tells me that that guy

01:39:26.125 --> 01:39:30.166
is fed up with that asshole, The Graduate,
and he wants to do him in.

01:39:30.666 --> 01:39:32.166
So speak to Chucky.

01:39:32.250 --> 01:39:37.625
Convince him. Get him in
on the plan to do in The Graduate.

01:39:37.708 --> 01:39:39.416
Listen to me, cuz.

01:39:40.291 --> 01:39:41.625
Listen to me, asshole.

01:39:42.125 --> 01:39:43.500
They can't get away with--

01:39:47.666 --> 01:39:49.541
-Hello?
-You're a good runner.

01:39:49.625 --> 01:39:51.625
I didn't expect that from a bookworm.

01:39:51.708 --> 01:39:53.833
I want to negotiate Valentina's return.

01:39:53.916 --> 01:39:55.458
Again with the jokes, man.

01:39:55.541 --> 01:39:58.041
I have some info.
I'm serious. I'm coming over.

01:39:58.125 --> 01:40:01.000
-Tell Chino not to hurt me, okay?
-Okay, come over.

01:40:01.083 --> 01:40:03.291
But it better be worth it.

01:40:03.375 --> 01:40:04.208
Yes.

01:40:42.375 --> 01:40:43.750
Can we talk in private?

01:40:49.541 --> 01:40:50.375
Follow me.

01:41:03.083 --> 01:41:05.125
Ahmed and Chucky want to fuck you over.

01:41:05.625 --> 01:41:07.125
What are you talking about?

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.333
Well, Ahmed is the one
in touch with the big boss, right?

01:41:11.416 --> 01:41:12.875
-No.
-He's not?

01:41:14.583 --> 01:41:16.541
Then what I came to say
doesn't make sense.

01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:19.333
Sorry.

01:41:21.041 --> 01:41:24.458
The faggot works for an associate
of the people at the top.

01:41:25.083 --> 01:41:27.166
He provides a service, so to speak.

01:41:28.791 --> 01:41:30.708
Tell me what you have to say.

01:41:35.583 --> 01:41:38.958
Ahmed thinks Chucky is better qualified.

01:41:39.666 --> 01:41:41.916
And that it's better
to deal with him directly.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.916
It seems that he told the top guy,
and they agreed.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.666
Why are you telling me this?

01:41:47.541 --> 01:41:48.916
You expect me to believe you?

01:41:49.833 --> 01:41:52.125
They say you're too violent.

01:41:52.833 --> 01:41:55.250
That you're constantly
jeopardizing the organization.

01:41:56.666 --> 01:41:58.083
Those fucking faggots.

01:41:59.666 --> 01:42:00.833
I want to make a deal.

01:42:09.125 --> 01:42:09.958
Vicente?

01:42:17.958 --> 01:42:19.500
What do you think, Vicente?

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.708
That fucking Chucky
wants to pull the rug out from under me.

01:43:06.166 --> 01:43:07.541
Evening!

01:43:08.541 --> 01:43:09.375
Hi.

01:43:12.583 --> 01:43:13.500
How's it going?

01:43:14.416 --> 01:43:16.375
-How's the kiddo?
-She's fine.

01:43:17.041 --> 01:43:17.875
She's asleep.

01:43:17.958 --> 01:43:21.291
She wanted to wait up,
but I told her you'd be back late.

01:43:22.125 --> 01:43:23.041
Good.

01:43:24.458 --> 01:43:25.291
Okay.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.500
How about a beer? My treat.
I won't take it out of your fee.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.208
No, thanks.

01:43:33.083 --> 01:43:36.208
Facundo, I'm staying here
until Juan Pablo gets home.

01:43:38.583 --> 01:43:39.500
No, dude.

01:43:40.208 --> 01:43:41.291
No, really.

01:43:41.375 --> 01:43:45.083
I'm grateful you stayed with Ale today,
but I don't want trouble with Juanpi.

01:43:45.166 --> 01:43:46.458
Don't worry, dude.

01:43:46.958 --> 01:43:48.791
I'll help you with Ale tomorrow.

01:43:54.250 --> 01:43:55.541
You're clever.

01:43:57.208 --> 01:43:58.083
All right.

01:43:59.083 --> 01:44:02.333
I'll tell him you forced your way in
if he makes a fuss.

01:44:02.833 --> 01:44:05.333
And you'll stay with Ale all day tomorrow.

01:44:06.583 --> 01:44:07.416
Okay.

THIS IS THE STORY OF MYSELF,
JUAN PABLO, AND VALENTINA…

01:45:26.083 --> 01:45:28.083
THE MEXICAN SHOOTS.

01:45:40.125 --> 01:45:42.375
CHUCKY SHOOTS.

01:45:55.416 --> 01:45:57.916
Hey, Laia. This is Valentina.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.041
You gave me your number, remember?

01:46:00.125 --> 01:46:01.500
I need to speak to you.

01:46:02.958 --> 01:46:05.541
This is what your ex wrote?
It's like a novel.

01:46:05.625 --> 01:46:08.250
Yes, it's a novel,
but it's autobiographical.

01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:11.041
What he says is true,
even though he uses fiction.

01:46:11.125 --> 01:46:14.000
How do you know? You broke up a while ago.

01:46:14.083 --> 01:46:17.208
Yes, but Juan Pablo
was being odd a while before that.

01:46:17.291 --> 01:46:19.708
He tried to stop me
from coming to Barcelona with him.

01:46:19.791 --> 01:46:22.416
He dumped me and then took it back,
like in the novel.

01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:24.375
Now I know they ordered him to do it.

01:46:25.625 --> 01:46:27.708
Come on, already! We have to go!

01:46:27.791 --> 01:46:31.000
Ale, we have 15 minutes.
Wait for me a moment.

01:46:31.083 --> 01:46:34.375
You must admit that the idea
of a criminal organization

01:46:34.458 --> 01:46:36.666
running your ex's love life is ridiculous.

01:46:36.750 --> 01:46:38.708
It was all part of a plan.

01:46:38.791 --> 01:46:40.791
Look, it's all in here, seriously.

01:46:41.666 --> 01:46:44.625
Read this.
It describes when he went to the police.

01:46:49.375 --> 01:46:51.375
-Fucking hell.
-Look at this.

01:46:58.291 --> 01:46:59.791
-Damn.
-Do you recognize him?

01:47:00.375 --> 01:47:03.541
-He's Laia's dad.
-Of course I know him. Everyone does.

01:47:03.625 --> 01:47:05.583
He's a big shot. A public figure.

01:47:06.166 --> 01:47:07.375
Can you help me?

01:47:07.458 --> 01:47:08.458
I don't know.

01:47:08.541 --> 01:47:12.708
I'm not big on literature,
and this is like a mix of truth and lies.

01:47:12.791 --> 01:47:16.583
If half of your ex's writing were true,
this would be a bombshell.

01:47:16.666 --> 01:47:17.916
What are we talking about?

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:21.541
A conspiracy by Mexican drug lords
to launder money in Catalonia?

01:47:21.625 --> 01:47:23.916
Through Oriol Carbonell?
Through the party?

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.333
Sheltered by someone
within Mozos de Escuadra? Come on!

01:47:28.208 --> 01:47:30.333
Please help me find Juan Pablo.

01:47:30.833 --> 01:47:32.708
I can't activate the protocol yet.

01:47:33.291 --> 01:47:34.625
I'll keep an eye out.

01:47:34.708 --> 01:47:37.125
-All right.
-In the meantime, I'll read this.

01:47:37.791 --> 01:47:38.833
Ale, let's go.

01:47:46.375 --> 01:47:48.000
"I had nightmares last night."

01:47:48.083 --> 01:47:51.291
"I dreamed Vale was going back,
and they made her get off the plane too."

01:47:51.375 --> 01:47:55.500
"I woke up, and Chino took me to see a cop
called Riquer to identify the Italian."

01:47:55.583 --> 01:47:59.208
"The office had a signed
Espanyol jersey on the wall."

01:47:59.291 --> 01:48:00.125
Shit.

01:48:07.666 --> 01:48:08.500
Valentina!

01:48:30.875 --> 01:48:33.666
I kept thinking
about the verb "disappear."

01:48:35.250 --> 01:48:37.625
When they told me you hadn't "appeared,"

01:48:38.833 --> 01:48:40.833
it made me think of a magic trick.

01:48:42.666 --> 01:48:44.958
A magician who makes something disappear

01:48:45.583 --> 01:48:47.541
and then makes it reappear.

01:48:49.875 --> 01:48:51.250
But you don't reappear.

01:48:52.083 --> 01:48:52.916
Hello, son.

01:48:53.708 --> 01:48:57.416
Your mother hasn't lost hope
that you're receiving my messages.

01:48:58.166 --> 01:49:01.833
And for some reason
your mother can't understand,

01:49:01.916 --> 01:49:03.458
we haven't heard from you.

01:49:04.041 --> 01:49:07.666
Maybe you went to teach in Botswana
with Valentina. I don't know, son.

01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:08.666
MISSING

01:49:09.250 --> 01:49:12.500
Well, your mother wanted to tell you
she's in Barcelona.

01:49:13.375 --> 01:49:19.375
Yes, I was invited to a conference
for the relatives of missing persons.

01:49:20.250 --> 01:49:25.375
Your dad's doctor wouldn't let him travel,
so your mother came by herself.

01:49:28.125 --> 01:49:29.416
Guess what, son?

01:49:30.125 --> 01:49:32.041
Your mother met Laia.

01:49:32.125 --> 01:49:33.916
Very briefly though.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.500
She's gorgeous!
So elegant and well-mannered.

01:49:39.083 --> 01:49:41.750
She apologized
for bringing her family lawyer,

01:49:41.833 --> 01:49:44.791
but her father insisted
in case he could help.

01:49:45.708 --> 01:49:47.458
Anyway, son,

01:49:47.541 --> 01:49:51.916
your mother is wandering around
this beautiful city,

01:49:52.875 --> 01:49:57.208
hoping that…
that you might appear at any moment.

01:49:57.833 --> 01:50:00.500
Because you can't leave
your story halfway.

01:50:01.125 --> 01:50:02.833
Stories need an ending.

01:50:02.916 --> 01:50:05.833
A happy ending, or a sad one,

01:50:06.583 --> 01:50:07.458
but an ending.

01:50:08.208 --> 01:50:09.625
-Listen to me!
-What?

01:50:09.708 --> 01:50:11.208
I knew Valentina.

01:50:11.291 --> 01:50:13.833
The head of the Mozos
and Laia Carbonell's father

01:50:13.916 --> 01:50:17.291
are involved in the murders
of Juan Pablo, Valentina, and the girl.

01:50:17.375 --> 01:50:20.416
That's not true. I spoke to Riquer
and Minister Carbonell.

01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:23.375
-They're working hard to find them.
-They're the murderers!

01:50:23.458 --> 01:50:25.791
Also, a Mexican criminal organization.

01:50:25.875 --> 01:50:27.958
They haven't found any bodies.

01:50:28.041 --> 01:50:30.500
They made them disappear. Same thing.

01:50:30.583 --> 01:50:32.583
Ma'am, I was a cop.

01:50:32.666 --> 01:50:34.958
They fired me
for trying to uncover the truth.

01:50:35.041 --> 01:50:36.541
They tried to silence me.

01:50:37.041 --> 01:50:39.166
Know what they did to Jimi,
Valentina's friend?

01:50:39.250 --> 01:50:40.875
-I don't know him.
-They killed him!

01:50:40.958 --> 01:50:43.166
And said it was an overdose.

01:50:43.250 --> 01:50:47.750
And it's all linked to Lorenzo's death.
It's all here, written by your son.

01:50:47.833 --> 01:50:49.958
If you don't believe me,
at least believe him…

01:50:52.083 --> 01:50:53.750
despite the title he chose.

01:51:01.833 --> 01:51:04.500
I'm not going to read this.
Leave me alone.

01:56:38.541 --> 01:56:43.541
