01:45.806 --> 01:48.878
You look completely different
out of your uniform.

01:51.244 --> 01:53.485
Is, is that loaded?

02:09.930 --> 02:12.069
Steady, son. Steady.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.941
Don't push till I tell you.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.744
Who? Oh...

02:53.674 --> 02:55.347
Yes? Who is it?

02:58.045 --> 02:59.718
Jesus, I'm late!

03:08.221 --> 03:09.962
Shit! Feck it.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.631
Hello. I can't stop, I slept late.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.470
Oh, for God's sake!

03:21.068 --> 03:22.911
Jesus. Feck it.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.544
Shit!

03:29.242 --> 03:30.915
Feck it. Get in!

03:40.187 --> 03:43.862
Oh, that's me now back on time.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.377
Wait a minute.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.719
This shouldn't be here.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.887
That's better.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.390
This is the movie!

04:16.456 --> 04:18.458
- Winnie!
- Hiya.

04:19.291 --> 04:22.296
- Morning, Fat Annie.
- Good morning, Agnes.

04:22.395 --> 04:25.069
Do you think the carrots will be
as expensive today as they were yesterday?

04:25.132 --> 04:27.237
If they are, I hope they're small ones,

04:27.300 --> 04:30.144
'cause the wholesaler
can shove them up his arse.

04:40.313 --> 04:43.783
Cathy starts her new job today.
An office job.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.625
Imagine being stuck in an office all day.

04:45.719 --> 04:50.168
Not me, Annie. I'm an independent trader.
Born to it and lovin' it.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.931
Morning, Father Damien.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.100
- Mornin'.
- This is the life.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.004
- Mornin'!
- Ooh, thank you.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.243
Come on, girls!

05:29.496 --> 05:31.169
Good morning!

07:08.128 --> 07:10.074
Good morning, Dublin!

07:12.132 --> 07:16.911
Get the finest of fruit and vegetables
from all over the world right here!

07:18.638 --> 07:22.916
The best of fruit! The greenest of greens!

07:24.311 --> 07:26.587
And the friendliest of service!

07:27.247 --> 07:28.920
Tom, if you're not buying, fuck off.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.089
There goes Perry Mason.

07:33.153 --> 07:36.259
Yeah. He wouldn't get a
prison guard out of prison.

07:38.091 --> 07:41.095
- Morning, Agnes.
- Hello, Jasper. What have you got for me?

07:41.161 --> 07:42.799
That'll be the Revenue Office.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.968
Just as well it's brown, so
they won't see me wiping my arse with it.

07:48.101 --> 07:51.446
Beautiful kumquats, Brussels sprouts
and prickly pears!

07:51.504 --> 07:53.824
How are you, love?
Do you want to squeeze my prickly pears?

07:56.977 --> 07:58.615
- Morning, Mammy.
- Hello, Dermot son.

07:58.678 --> 08:00.351
- Hello, Maria.
- Hello, Mrs Brown.

08:00.447 --> 08:02.449
And how's my lovely triplets today?

08:02.515 --> 08:04.426
George has a touch of wind.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.430
What's the matter? What's the matter?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.159
Oh, that's Ringo.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.764
Hey, you big lizard!

08:10.824 --> 08:14.271
It's a frog, you blind bastard.
Ribbit, ribbit!

08:14.327 --> 08:16.000
No, Dermot, you're a gecko.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.550
I've been saying "ribbit, ribbit" all week.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.506
I'll be off. I have to meet Buster.

08:21.601 --> 08:24.309
- How is Buster, love?
- He's fine.

08:25.105 --> 08:28.314
Are we "not guilty" again today, Buster?

08:28.375 --> 08:30.048
We are.

08:31.378 --> 08:36.054
So, Mr Cunningham, will you tell the court
how many horses do you own?

08:36.149 --> 08:40.154
Seven.
But six now, since that bastard stole one.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.325
Justice, I object.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.835
He is pointing at my client.

08:44.891 --> 08:47.201
That is prejudicial.

08:47.327 --> 08:51.332
That, Mr Crews,
is because your client is on trial here.

08:51.398 --> 08:53.241
That's fair enough, I suppose, isn't it?

08:55.902 --> 08:57.575
He's good, isn't he?

09:00.573 --> 09:02.211
Morning, Ma.

09:02.308 --> 09:04.185
Hello, Mark. Hello, Betty.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.188
- Great news, Ma.
- You're pregnant?

09:07.247 --> 09:10.922
Oh, thank God. A brother for Bono.
I'll start knitting.

09:11.017 --> 09:12.758
It's not a brother for Bono.

09:12.852 --> 09:15.162
A sister for Bono. I'll wife knitting.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.361
- I'm not pregnant.
- Are you sure?

09:18.425 --> 09:21.599
- It's a job, Ma.
- For Bono? He's only six, love.

09:22.328 --> 09:24.604
Mark's got a new carpentry contract.
A big one.

09:24.864 --> 09:26.571
Congratulations, love.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.841
Poor Bono. Growing up an only child.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.844
See you later, Ma.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.746
Hello, Evelyn.

09:36.843 --> 09:39.221
She's looking great. Hope
she paid for that...

09:39.279 --> 09:42.192
- Morning, Agnes.
- My fuckin' foot!

09:42.248 --> 09:45.388
Will you two feckin' talk to each other,
and don't be texting.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.193
I see you, Laura, I see you.

09:48.788 --> 09:50.768
Hello, Braden. Look at you.

09:50.857 --> 09:53.235
- He's getting hairy like his father.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.899
- A very good morning to you, Agnes.
- Hello, Rab.

09:55.962 --> 09:59.239
- Out last night doing a bit of reggae'?
- I am not from Jamaica.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.973
? Lie down girl
Let me push it up, push it up ?

10:03.136 --> 10:06.117
Here, Rasta man... Take
the air out of that.

10:11.377 --> 10:13.288
Mr Cunningham...

10:13.379 --> 10:17.759
Is it true that you starve your animals?

10:18.284 --> 10:20.890
Tom Crews, solicitor. C-R-E-W-S.

10:21.621 --> 10:25.831
In fact, were you not found guilty
of the mistreatment of your horses

10:25.925 --> 10:30.271
on four occasions over the past 12 months?

10:30.330 --> 10:32.241
Justice. if I may...

10:32.298 --> 10:34.608
Mr Cunningham is not on trial here.

10:34.667 --> 10:37.113
Go somewhere else, please, Mr Crews.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.480
With, with, with the questions.

10:39.906 --> 10:42.113
Yeah, the...

10:42.175 --> 10:45.019
He...

10:46.446 --> 10:48.517
- A horse. He...
- Psst!

10:50.083 --> 10:51.756
Come.

10:55.021 --> 10:57.126
Do we have a question, Mr Crews?

10:59.959 --> 11:01.632
Mr Cunningham,

11:01.694 --> 11:06.143
what is the name of this horse
that you allege my client stole?

11:06.199 --> 11:09.339
I just called him "horsey".
Like, "Come here, horsey, horsey'.

11:09.435 --> 11:13.315
No, not what you called it.
The name-name of this horse.

11:13.373 --> 11:17.150
I mean, it would be on the papers
that you have for this horse.

11:19.779 --> 11:22.692
I don't have papers.
He didn't come with papers.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.155
You have a photograph of this horse?

11:25.652 --> 11:29.156
What the fuck would I be doing
taking a photograph of a horse for?

11:31.724 --> 11:36.002
Justice, without any evidence
of the existence of this horse,

11:36.062 --> 11:40.067
how can my client be
accused of stealing it?

11:40.166 --> 11:44.171
To all intents and purposes,
this horse does not even exist.

11:46.739 --> 11:48.719
I have a very busy day ahead of me.

11:48.808 --> 11:52.722
I cant spend time on the theft
of an invisible horse.

11:52.812 --> 11:54.485
Case dismissed.

12:00.720 --> 12:04.361
How can a one-pound box of chocolates
put on five pounds?

12:04.424 --> 12:06.097
It's beyond my apprehension.

12:07.427 --> 12:10.101
Cathy's talking about getting me
something nice for my birthday.

12:10.196 --> 12:12.005
Really? What?

12:12.065 --> 12:14.170
Tickets to go to Placido Dodominigo.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.113
Oh, lovely. For a week or 10 days?

12:20.907 --> 12:24.411
Speaking of birthdays, I don't know what
to get my Sharon for hers next week.

12:24.510 --> 12:27.116
- Get her a book.
- No, she has one.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.530
You know, Winnie,
I live for these little chats of ours.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.361
- Me, too, Agnes.
- Here, come on.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.367
Off with you. I have work to do.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.096
OK.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.865
Yes, love?

12:40.927 --> 12:43.088
What's the difference between
those apples for 50 cents

12:43.129 --> 12:44.972
and those for apples for 75?

12:45.064 --> 12:48.477
Well these ones are low fat.
They're called Granny Smith Lite.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.942
I'll take of the low fat 75 cent ones.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.446
That's 1.50, love, please.

12:55.541 --> 12:57.214
There you go.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.984
Have a nice day.

12:59.078 --> 13:02.753
You're a gas, Agnes.
The low fat ones should be cheaper.

13:02.815 --> 13:04.920
- Winnie, off with you. Go on, go.
- Right.

13:06.653 --> 13:08.633
Farm-fresh eggs!

13:08.721 --> 13:11.827
So fresh the hen doesn't
even know they're missing yet!

13:17.430 --> 13:20.434
Are you all right there, Maggie?
Can you manage, love?

13:22.935 --> 13:24.915
That's 15 stalls in six months.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.284
Bastards.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.812
They won't be happy
till they close us all down.

13:32.912 --> 13:35.415
Then there won't be a Moore Street Market.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.189
Well, they won't take me without a fight,
Fat Annie.

13:39.018 --> 13:40.691
Whoever they are.

13:58.971 --> 14:01.042
Another one gone, Ivan.

14:04.944 --> 14:10.724
Now all we need are four more,
and we can start building.

14:11.317 --> 14:13.991
And once we have started building,

14:14.053 --> 14:18.126
all of the other stall holders
will just shut up shop.

14:24.464 --> 14:27.384
He says get building shopping centre,
or he will rip off your fucking head

14:27.400 --> 14:29.073
and sheet down your neck.

14:29.869 --> 14:35.319
The working class can fuck my ass.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.151
- "Kiss my arse". What?

14:38.211 --> 14:42.887
The words are "kiss my arse".
"Fuck my arse" is an entirely...

14:45.184 --> 14:47.425
Calm down, Ivan.

14:47.920 --> 14:51.094
Your money is safe. No need to worry.

14:51.190 --> 14:53.830
We've started on planning
permission already.

14:58.197 --> 14:59.938
Now...

15:00.032 --> 15:04.947
Let's see which stall will be
the next one to go, shall we?

15:06.606 --> 15:08.347
This one.

15:09.776 --> 15:12.347
- Jesus.
- Are you all right, Agnes?

15:12.412 --> 15:15.916
I got a shiver,
like somebody just walked over me grave.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.225
Annie.

15:23.289 --> 15:26.759
Keep an eye here, will you? I want to
run this up to Cathy at her new job.

15:26.859 --> 15:28.532
No bother, Agnes.

15:30.696 --> 15:33.370
To Cathy.
Good luck in your new job.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.310
I believe in you. Mammy.

15:37.970 --> 15:39.643
Settling in OK there, little lady?

15:39.739 --> 15:41.480
Well, sort of, Mr Bullwhip.

15:41.941 --> 15:45.718
Calm down.
We don't stand on ceremony here, honey.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.884
And it's Cathy. Not
"honey" or "little lady'.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.621
Very good.

15:52.251 --> 15:53.992
Yoo-hoo!

15:55.555 --> 15:57.262
I'm at the window.

15:57.323 --> 16:00.896
- I'm still not sure of my role here.
- I have fruit.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.406
- Look, Cathy...
- Bananas.

16:03.463 --> 16:07.673
People buy something
not because they need it...

16:09.502 --> 16:12.278
but because we, the
advertising geniuses,

16:12.338 --> 16:16.309
try to find a way to convince them
that they want it.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.782
- Do you?
- You mean, "Do we", babe.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.519
Who the fuck is he?

16:23.516 --> 16:25.189
Right, well...

16:27.520 --> 16:29.193
Settle in, sweetheart.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.002
- Madam.
- Fuckface.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.201
I beg your pardon?

16:37.296 --> 16:40.675
Nice... Nice place, I said. Good place.

16:42.368 --> 16:44.439
Mammy! Get in here.

16:47.273 --> 16:48.980
"Settle in, sweetheart."

16:49.041 --> 16:50.987
I know. I heard.

16:51.043 --> 16:54.820
You wouldn't have to put up with that shit
if you worked for yourself.

16:55.214 --> 16:57.854
I'm not taking over the stall!

16:57.950 --> 17:00.055
I'm just saying, wife all I did...

17:00.820 --> 17:02.493
I'm just... I...

17:03.356 --> 17:05.029
I'm just saying!

17:05.124 --> 17:06.728
Didn't hurt.

17:11.897 --> 17:14.037
Come on, Winnie. While it's warm.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.480
- Agnes...
- What?

17:21.540 --> 17:26.012
How come Father Damien always gives you
more penance than he gives me?

17:26.078 --> 17:27.819
Because I've a lot more sins.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.553
No, you don't.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.356
Oh, I do.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.900
Bless me, Father, for l have sinned.

17:47.867 --> 17:50.575
- This box is already in use.
- Winnie, get out.

17:50.670 --> 17:55.016
Not until I've heard your sins.
Father, I'm much more sinful than her.

17:55.074 --> 17:58.419
- What?
- Will you get out, for Jesus' sake?

17:58.511 --> 18:01.287
Mrs Brown' do not take
the Lord's name in vain.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.954
Sorry, Father, I'll add it on
to my list in a minute.

18:04.050 --> 18:05.723
- Mammy?

18:05.785 --> 18:09.096
- Father, is that my Cathy?
- I had impure thoughts, Father.

18:09.188 --> 18:10.895
Shut up, Winnie.

18:11.290 --> 18:12.963
Hello, Father Damien.

18:13.059 --> 18:14.902
Hello, Cathy.

18:14.961 --> 18:16.634
Look, if you need to talk...

18:16.729 --> 18:19.642
- Mammy, what is this?
- I can't see.

18:21.133 --> 18:22.874
It's an envelope.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.074
- I robbed a bank.
- A bank?

18:25.137 --> 18:27.117
You did not, Winnie. Shut up!

18:27.206 --> 18:30.881
It's a letter from the tax office.
"Final Notice" it says.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.581
Why haven't you done something about it?

18:32.645 --> 18:36.058
I don't pay tax. I changed
my name to Google.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.096
Look ladies, if you wanna chat,
why don't you go somewhere else?

18:39.151 --> 18:40.824
Shush, Father.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.730
That is a letter about my business,
about my stall,

18:43.789 --> 18:45.496
and you have made it perfectly clear...

18:45.591 --> 18:47.502
It's a demand for a payment.

18:47.593 --> 18:49.334
This is not the place.

18:49.428 --> 18:51.101
Yes, it is.

18:51.163 --> 18:53.803
Apparently my grandmother
owes them £96.

18:53.899 --> 18:56.937
And as the current owner
of the business, I'm liable.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.347
- I had sex with a farm animal.
- What?

18:59.438 --> 19:01.111
A goat.

19:01.607 --> 19:03.644
No, you did not.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.189
Not even a goat would
give her a shag, Father.

19:06.278 --> 19:09.282
That's it! That's it, ladies. Out!

19:09.348 --> 19:11.021
Come on! Out now!

19:12.785 --> 19:16.028
Give me penance. Come on, lay it on me.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.828
Do your worst!

19:19.692 --> 19:21.672
You better take this serious.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.139
Fine. I'll go to the tax
office in the morning.

19:24.196 --> 19:27.006
Mrs McGoogan, are you licking my shoes?

19:28.701 --> 19:30.374
£96.

19:30.469 --> 19:33.177
Even with interest and penalties,
it cant be that bad.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.779
Are you feckin' mad? How much?

19:37.877 --> 19:40.323
Four million Euro.

19:41.113 --> 19:42.820
Four million Euro?

19:43.683 --> 19:46.061
Ah, listen, love, there
must be some mistake.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.896
Jesus, now you've killed her.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.528
How much?

19:54.694 --> 19:57.402
So, I've had quite a large tax bill.

19:58.230 --> 19:59.903
Four million Euro.

20:00.399 --> 20:02.072
But you mustn't worry.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.428
I'm not worrying. It's not my problem.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.901
Your mummy's right.
There's nothing to worry about.

20:23.989 --> 20:27.436
The man in the Revenue Office
said it was probably a mistake.

20:27.526 --> 20:30.700
- When did he say that?
- Just after you passed out.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.767
- But why didn't you tell me?
- You were passed out.

20:34.100 --> 20:37.172
For God's sake, sometimes you're
as useless as a knitted condom.

20:37.937 --> 20:40.383
- Well, he said he'd ring you.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.381
Wish me luck.

20:45.444 --> 20:47.754
- Hello?

20:50.249 --> 20:51.922
Wish me luck.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.023
Hello? How do you do?

20:56.188 --> 20:58.065
Speaking.

20:58.124 --> 21:01.401
It's him. It is a mistake?

21:02.728 --> 21:04.969
I only owe 3.8 million?

21:07.299 --> 21:11.213
Well, that's a relief.
I won't have to sell the feckin' yacht.

21:12.972 --> 21:15.111
I think you will have to sell the yacht.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.607
- How long have you had a yacht?
- How much is a yacht worth?

21:17.643 --> 21:20.146
I don't have a feckin' yacht!

21:21.147 --> 21:24.219
I know. You go on hunger strike.
Refuse to eat until they cancel the bill.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.230
They'd have to cancel it in 20 minutes.
I'm fuckin' starvin'.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.732
I have a better idea.

21:30.990 --> 21:34.904
I get the old unit together.
We blow up the Revenue Office,

21:34.960 --> 21:37.463
then we barricade ourselves in here,

21:37.563 --> 21:39.804
prime the place with booby traps

21:39.899 --> 21:42.607
and take out the first
tax man that comes near.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.780
They'll never take you alive.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.755
Somebody get his feckin' tablets.

21:53.279 --> 21:54.952
What we need is a lawyer, Mammy.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.016
All right, but a cheap one.

22:00.519 --> 22:04.592
Now, I can't make head nor tails of this.

22:04.657 --> 22:09.834
According to this reference number,
you need a licence to import cobra snakes.

22:10.129 --> 22:12.973
That's not a reference number. It's a date.

22:15.768 --> 22:18.647
I said cheap. I didn't
mean this fucking cheap.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.508
Offer the tax people a euro a week.

22:22.608 --> 22:24.315
Winnie, don't be ridiculous.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.682
I'm not, Agnes.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.486
They might not accept it

22:28.547 --> 22:32.393
but once you make an offer
the courts have to consider it.

22:32.484 --> 22:34.157
She's right.

22:34.220 --> 22:36.393
How do you know all this, Mrs McGoogan?

22:36.956 --> 22:38.731
I worked in the Revenue Office.

22:40.392 --> 22:42.497
You were a tax collector?

22:42.561 --> 22:44.802
Cleaner. But I heard things.

22:46.398 --> 22:48.742
If that's the case,
it'll give us time to set up a fund.

22:49.235 --> 22:52.216
- A fund?
- "The Mrs Brown Defence Fund."

22:52.304 --> 22:55.649
I'm liking this. Who'll be treasurer?

22:55.708 --> 22:57.381
Not you.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.495
Hello, Mrs Brown.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.331
Hello. Can I help you?

23:12.391 --> 23:15.201
Actually, it's me who's here
to help you, madam.

23:17.096 --> 23:21.738
I don't get it. Why would you want
to buy my mother's stall and licence?

23:22.334 --> 23:24.109
My client is a well-known retailer.

23:24.203 --> 23:28.242
Who, I'm sure you'll appreciate,
I'm not at liberty to reveal at this time.

23:28.340 --> 23:32.117
And he sees this as an opportunity
to invest in the community.

23:33.279 --> 23:34.952
30,000 is a lot of money.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.458
Over 200 years is a lot of heritage.

23:39.618 --> 23:42.622
It was my great, great grandmother
that started the stall.

23:43.355 --> 23:46.700
It's been handed down to the eldest girl
in the family ever since.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.567
Since 1802.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.769
The times they are a-changing.

23:53.198 --> 23:55.576
- There's one problem.
- And that is?

23:56.035 --> 23:57.742
Show him the tax letter.

24:03.409 --> 24:05.082
Not a problem.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.987
It's now 3.8 million.

24:07.713 --> 24:11.889
My client brings a lot of investment
and employment to Ireland.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.989
Once we agree the sale,
we can make this go away.

24:16.322 --> 24:19.565
- Really? Just like that?
- Just like that.

24:21.493 --> 24:23.837
Right then. I'll leave that with you.

24:23.929 --> 24:26.432
You have my card.

24:26.498 --> 24:28.171
I'll see you out.

24:42.081 --> 24:43.788
I'm sorry, Granny.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.156
I've let you down.

24:48.654 --> 24:50.531
There's my grandmother.

24:52.424 --> 24:54.131
They were false teeth.

24:55.027 --> 24:56.802
They were a wedding present.

24:58.197 --> 25:01.644
Only If we are united can
we save Moore Street Market.

25:01.700 --> 25:05.477
So, does anyone have a question
for our political representative, Mr lnuin?

25:08.374 --> 25:10.354
Silence!

25:10.442 --> 25:14.322
Now, look, I am here to assure you

25:14.380 --> 25:19.022
that as long as I am the representative
for this constituency,

25:19.351 --> 25:22.560
Moore Street Market is hereto stay!

25:25.057 --> 25:27.628
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
if you will excuse me,

25:27.693 --> 25:29.798
I have some government
business to attend to.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.808
Very good. Thank you.

25:34.666 --> 25:37.545
Lots of shite about nothing.
Living the dream, what?

25:38.170 --> 25:39.843
Living the dream.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.187
Mrs Brown. You came.

25:45.177 --> 25:48.488
I forgot this was even on.
We're just here for a drink, that's all.

25:48.547 --> 25:52.188
But, Agnes, you are the most important
of all the stallholders in Moore Street.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.356
- Well...
- Not for long.

25:54.420 --> 25:57.833
- What? What does she mean?
- Nothing, nothing.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.063
- She's selling her stall.
- Winnie, move.

26:06.532 --> 26:09.035
- Can I have your attention, please?
- Show us your cock!

26:09.101 --> 26:10.774
- Shh!

26:11.203 --> 26:15.049
I have an important announcement
concerning Mrs Agnes Brown.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.547
Wife he feckin' saying?

26:18.610 --> 26:20.283
They have won again.

26:22.347 --> 26:26.193
Mrs Brown is selling her stall
and leaving Moore Street.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.969
Shit, do something.

26:40.232 --> 26:41.905
Stop it.

26:44.236 --> 26:46.375
I'm thinking about it.
I haven't made a decision yet.

26:47.539 --> 26:49.246
Don't look at me like that!

26:51.210 --> 26:54.419
Wife nothing to do
with Rab's imaginary "them".

26:54.480 --> 26:57.927
I have a tax bill.
I can't afford to pay it. wife it.

26:57.983 --> 27:00.088
But we all love you, Mrs Brown.

27:00.152 --> 27:03.929
If you cannot pay it' we will all
chip in and help you pay it.

27:03.989 --> 27:06.333
- We are family.
- Yes.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.427
I've no fucking family in Jamaica.

27:08.494 --> 27:10.565
I'm not Jamaican.

27:11.430 --> 27:14.274
Hands up those that will chip in
to help Mrs Brown.

27:17.836 --> 27:19.679
The tax bill's about four million Euro.

27:23.442 --> 27:27.686
There you are, Rab. Look, Mr Patel...
I don't know, maybe you're right.

27:27.779 --> 27:30.692
Maybe there is a "them“,
but it makes no difference.

27:31.316 --> 27:32.989
Exactly. No difference.

27:33.652 --> 27:37.862
Agnes doesn't care who it is. She'll not
leave Moore Street without a fight.

27:37.956 --> 27:39.629
- Exactly.

27:39.925 --> 27:43.498
No, wait, wait. Winnie, what the fuck are you...
Winnie, get back here!

27:44.363 --> 27:47.173
Did you think for one minute Agnes Brown
would go without a fight?

27:47.266 --> 27:48.973
Wife!

27:49.034 --> 27:51.640
When they tried to double the price
of the licence, who beat them down?

27:51.703 --> 27:53.376
Agnes.

27:53.472 --> 27:56.646
When the Corporation tried to reduce
the stall space, who told them to...

27:56.708 --> 27:58.551
Agnes!

27:59.044 --> 28:00.785
Jesus Christ.

28:03.382 --> 28:07.159
Oh, Winnie. What have you feckin' started?

28:07.219 --> 28:09.529
? Oh, we're going to Jamaica

28:09.621 --> 28:13.194
? Oh, back to the palm trees ?

28:33.879 --> 28:35.552
Rip off heads!

28:59.271 --> 29:00.944
Not yet.

29:07.846 --> 29:10.520
Mr Bogmonovitch
doesn't like public meetings.

29:10.582 --> 29:13.392
This Mrs Brown, she has a mouth on her.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.523
I was there, remember?

29:16.255 --> 29:20.795
Now I wouldn't be getting too worried
about a little local public meeting.

29:20.892 --> 29:25.238
Mr Bogmonovitch says that we should
rip off her head and sheet down her neck.

29:25.297 --> 29:28.608
Well, yes, Gregor, if the need arises.

29:28.700 --> 29:32.773
But for now, let's keep the whole thing
under the radar.

29:33.372 --> 29:36.751
Let's keep this quiet, hmm?

29:55.427 --> 29:58.271
Mummy' they're talking
about Granny on the TV.

30:00.799 --> 30:04.611
But what we know is Agnes Brown
is a mother of six children

30:04.670 --> 30:06.513
whom she reared alone.

30:06.605 --> 30:09.779
Her only income
is from her Moore Street stall

30:09.841 --> 30:13.118
which has been handed down from
mother to daughter for generations

30:13.178 --> 30:16.455
- and which, I believe, is now under threat.
- Yes, Eamonn,

30:16.515 --> 30:19.519
I'm here on Moore Street with Rab Patel...

30:19.618 --> 30:22.326
- A shop owner originally from Jamaica.

30:22.421 --> 30:26.096
Tell me, Mr Patel, what exactly
is the threat facing this market?

30:26.158 --> 30:27.796
This is not new.

30:27.859 --> 30:31.636
There is someone trying to drive us
all out of Moore Street Market.

30:31.697 --> 30:33.608
A developer. And he knows who he is!

30:43.842 --> 30:46.322
OK, enough now. Move on.

30:50.315 --> 30:53.728
Seriously, go now. I have work to do.

30:56.288 --> 30:58.791
Hey! Fuck off!

31:02.060 --> 31:03.733
Move it! Shoo!

31:03.829 --> 31:05.831
Well, you've certainly made a splash.

31:05.897 --> 31:07.843
I've no time for that shite, Annie.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.474
Fresh fruit and vegetables!

31:12.170 --> 31:13.911
As seen on TV!

31:16.641 --> 31:18.985
Just the one, love? That'll be 75 cents.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.923
75 fucking cent.

31:30.522 --> 31:32.593
Now it's a smoothie. That's 2.50.

31:33.091 --> 31:36.163
Hey! You sell your stall, you stupid bitch!

31:36.228 --> 31:37.901
Excuse me a moment.

31:44.102 --> 31:45.945
Anything else, love?

31:46.037 --> 31:49.075
- I'll be back.
- Hasta la vista, Arnie.

31:50.275 --> 31:53.415
And you'll want to bring more
than the Blues Brothers.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.355
You'll fucking need them.

31:56.782 --> 31:58.455
Are you all right, Mammy?

31:58.550 --> 32:01.429
Rab Patel is right.
Somethings going on, Dermot.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.625
I've just been threatened by Russian thugs.

32:04.890 --> 32:07.302
Russian?
- I think they'll be back.

32:07.392 --> 32:09.065
Why?

32:09.127 --> 32:11.266
'Cause he said "I'll be back".

32:15.734 --> 32:19.272
Hiya, Gloria. I'm looking for Buster Brady.
Is he doing something here?

32:19.371 --> 32:22.978
- That little shit. He's down the big hall.
- Thank you.

32:32.584 --> 32:35.087
You must use your senses.

32:36.655 --> 32:38.328
Trust them.

32:39.157 --> 32:41.831
They will tell you where the glass is.

32:42.327 --> 32:45.501
You're like a cheetah in the dark,

32:45.597 --> 32:48.271
but you'd know exactly
where to place your foot.

32:49.634 --> 32:51.614
You're invincible.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.343
A human radar.

32:55.006 --> 32:57.953
Hiya, Dermot. Here, I'll
leave that with you.

32:59.778 --> 33:01.621
What the hell are you doing?

33:01.680 --> 33:03.318
Just helping Mr Wang.

33:05.450 --> 33:07.589
Ah, you dope.

33:07.652 --> 33:09.859
- Medic!
- On my way.

33:10.755 --> 33:13.634
Mr Wang hurt his leg,
so I just said I'd help out.

33:15.594 --> 33:17.437
Ninja, for the blind?

33:17.996 --> 33:20.806
Hello, friend of Misser Busser.

33:20.866 --> 33:26.009
You're very welcome to Mr Wang
number one Ninja School for the Brind.

33:26.638 --> 33:29.050
- He's not even Chinese!

33:29.140 --> 33:33.213
Herro, Mr Taliban! I'm
from Sichuan Province.

33:33.879 --> 33:35.517
He's from Finglas.

33:35.614 --> 33:38.288
Everybody look at me and say
"What you doing in my country?"

33:38.350 --> 33:41.991
I say "Ha, Chinese". They go...

33:44.456 --> 33:46.129
- Keep going.
- I'm sorry.

33:47.125 --> 33:49.071
Your spit went past me.

33:50.395 --> 33:52.341
You only see brind people.

33:52.397 --> 33:55.901
You do not see that
they see more than you see.

33:56.001 --> 33:57.844
Please, show some respect.

34:00.171 --> 34:02.082
You brind fucker. I kill you!

34:03.241 --> 34:06.313
Come on, let's get out of here.
I need to talk to you.

34:07.145 --> 34:10.149
Mammy has a problem,
and I think the Russians are involved.

34:10.215 --> 34:13.059
The Russians?
I'm not getting involved in that.

34:13.150 --> 34:15.188
Marie is thinking about setting up a fund.

34:15.253 --> 34:16.994
A fund? I'm in.

34:17.856 --> 34:21.599
I kill you! You can't run, you can't hide!
I kill you!

34:26.097 --> 34:29.010
A quiz night.
That should raise at least 200 Euro.

34:30.235 --> 34:33.273
This lawyer and the barrister
could cost up to 25,000.

34:33.605 --> 34:36.051
I've a sponsor here who'll pay 5,000 Euro

34:36.107 --> 34:38.587
if somebody agrees
to swim across the Channel.

34:38.677 --> 34:41.418
- No.
- Wait, I'll do that.

34:41.513 --> 34:44.551
Really?
- Oh, Maria, he's a great swimmer.

34:44.616 --> 34:47.790
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. How hard can it be?

34:47.886 --> 34:51.129
We could make it really big.
It could be the launch of the whole thing.

34:51.556 --> 34:54.092
Right' then, let's do it. This weekend.

34:54.693 --> 34:57.071
What? Do you not need
to train for a few weeks?

34:57.128 --> 35:00.200
- Not at all.
- A wonderful swimmer.

35:00.966 --> 35:02.639
A dolphin.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.916
I thought she said the canal.

35:11.042 --> 35:12.715
Shh.

35:13.244 --> 35:16.748
Now just do your best.
Just go as far as you can.

35:16.815 --> 35:18.556
You're very brave.

35:19.384 --> 35:21.057
I have this, thank you' Barbara.

35:21.319 --> 35:23.321
Fine.

35:23.421 --> 35:25.924
This is an injustice
of mammoth proportions.

35:25.991 --> 35:29.803
A widow being persecuted
while the bankers and developer barons

35:29.894 --> 35:31.601
ride roughshod over the law!

35:39.838 --> 35:44.116
Five, four, three, two, one.

35:48.513 --> 35:50.186
Go!

36:12.837 --> 36:15.943
It's freezing!

36:18.476 --> 36:20.854
Rory! Rory!

36:21.446 --> 36:23.187
Barbara, towel.

36:23.948 --> 36:25.655
Rory!

36:29.120 --> 36:30.793
Rory!

36:32.123 --> 36:34.034
Rory, come back!

36:37.495 --> 36:40.408
OK, when we get in here,
let me do the talking.

36:40.498 --> 36:43.707
These Russians don't scare loo easy,
so let's try and sort this diplomatically.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.475
OK.

36:45.537 --> 36:48.643
And you know the drill. If it looks like
it's gonna kick off, what do we do?

36:48.707 --> 36:50.380
- Run like fuck.
- Exactly.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.223
Excuse me.

37:08.159 --> 37:10.833
We don't want any bad blood between us,

37:10.895 --> 37:14.206
but one of you lot threatened my
mother, and I'm not having that.

37:22.707 --> 37:24.380
What the fuck?

37:24.442 --> 37:27.889
I think he said everybody can be friends.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.687
How do you know'?

37:29.748 --> 37:32.126
I used to have a Russian girlfriend.

37:32.217 --> 37:35.391
Well, "girlfriend's" a bit strong.
She gave me a discount.

37:36.221 --> 37:38.030
Well, tell him that we want to be friends.

38:07.152 --> 38:08.961
Way to go, Buster. Well done.

38:14.793 --> 38:19.401
I will not kill your mother
because her name is Agnes.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.344
It was my grandmother's name.

38:24.903 --> 38:26.576
- He said...
- I heard him.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.479
- And what is your name?
Buster.

38:31.776 --> 38:33.949
But all my friends call me Agnes.

39:15.053 --> 39:17.033
These are a serious bunch.

39:17.121 --> 39:19.863
Maybe. But they don't have what we have.

39:22.126 --> 39:23.969
Ninjas.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.701
Shut up, Buster.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.472
Give me that phone here.

39:41.679 --> 39:43.352
Hello?

39:44.082 --> 39:47.928
This is Red Dog.
We need to get the unit together.

39:49.187 --> 39:50.860
I have a little job.

40:08.006 --> 40:10.577
- So that's them'?
- Yeah.

40:11.776 --> 40:14.222
Time we sent them a little message.

40:14.279 --> 40:17.055
- A bomb?
- Yeah.

40:17.115 --> 40:21.029
Just enough to turn that
coffee bar into a car park.

40:21.085 --> 40:23.065
And who's making the device?

40:23.121 --> 40:24.862
He should be here any minute.

40:27.859 --> 40:30.465
Here he is now' right on time.

40:39.304 --> 40:43.810
He's priming the device.
Then he'll drive it up to the target.

40:44.943 --> 40:47.981
That looks likes "The Hammer“ Murphy.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.753
It is. The best in the business.

40:51.649 --> 40:55.222
Ah... And I thought he had Parkinson's.

41:05.263 --> 41:07.573
Oh, shit. Scatter.

41:17.175 --> 41:20.782
Eileen, did you see somebody blew up
the Parkinson's charity shop last night?

41:20.845 --> 41:23.291
I did. Disgraceful.

41:23.348 --> 41:25.089
Should be ashamed of themselves.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.157
Agnes Brown.

41:28.920 --> 41:31.127
- Philomena Nine Warts.
- There you are.

41:31.189 --> 41:33.533
I was looking for you everywhere.

41:33.624 --> 41:35.297
Well I wasn't feckin' hiding.

41:35.860 --> 41:37.635
I wanted to tell you something.

41:37.695 --> 41:39.368
This is all very dramatic.

41:39.464 --> 41:44.675
I just didn't want to be discussing your
private business in front of everybody.

41:48.373 --> 41:50.046
My private business.

41:51.876 --> 41:57.155
I was at the bingo last night and I was
talking to the girls about your tax thing.

41:57.215 --> 41:59.024
- My private tax thing?
- Yeah.

41:59.117 --> 42:00.790
Go on.

42:00.852 --> 42:03.162
- The next thing, my granny...
- Mary Moccasin.

42:03.221 --> 42:08.034
She said she was in the Revenue Office
paying her tax

42:08.126 --> 42:10.402
the same day your granny was there

42:10.495 --> 42:14.341
and she saw your granny paying the bill.

42:14.399 --> 42:16.140
- Wife my granny paid it'?
- Yep.

42:16.667 --> 42:19.147
- Wife love to talk to your granny.
- Wife problem.

42:20.405 --> 42:22.908
Droopy drawers. 44.

42:23.875 --> 42:26.412
Two fat ladies, 88.

42:27.078 --> 42:28.751
Hello, Mary.

42:29.814 --> 42:35.355
Now Mary, can you tell us what you remember
about that morning in the Revenue Office?

42:36.354 --> 42:38.095
She's a bit deaf.

42:38.189 --> 42:40.362
Oh, right. Sorry, right.

42:41.259 --> 42:45.207
Mary! Can you tell me...

42:45.263 --> 42:48.107
Excuse me. She said "deaf" not "retarded".

42:49.000 --> 42:52.538
Gran, can you tell the man

42:52.603 --> 42:55.015
about the Revenue Office

42:55.073 --> 42:57.747
with Mrs Brown's granny.

42:57.842 --> 43:00.618
Um, yeah. Hmm-mmm.

43:01.446 --> 43:03.119
That's fantastic.

43:03.214 --> 43:06.684
Now can you get Mary to the law library
on Friday morning?

43:06.751 --> 43:11.257
We'll get a sworn affidavit and submit
it to the court. This is fantastic.

43:11.355 --> 43:14.199
- Oh, the... <i>Um...</i>
- What?

43:14.258 --> 43:16.397
No, no, no... We'll need a barrister.

43:16.461 --> 43:18.873
And I know just the man.

43:26.104 --> 43:29.483
I was born and raised in a cottage
on the banks of the Royal Canal.

43:30.241 --> 43:32.084
Bluebell Cottage, it was called.

43:32.143 --> 43:35.090
My father and mother lived there
all their married life.

43:35.813 --> 43:40.159
When my father died in 1999, my mother,
of course, was brokenhearted.

43:40.918 --> 43:44.991
But that cottage had so much
of my father in it, in every corner.

43:45.490 --> 43:47.163
It kept her strong.

43:47.959 --> 43:49.632
That's nice.

43:50.228 --> 43:51.935
Can we get on to my case, please?

43:51.996 --> 43:54.567
Agnes. Give the lad a chance.

43:55.399 --> 43:57.072
Go on, son.

43:57.135 --> 44:00.275
Well, in 1999 the PR Irwin Company

44:01.405 --> 44:03.442
bought most of the canal bank cottages.

44:04.275 --> 44:07.984
They wanted to build apartments,
but my mother wouldn't sell.

44:09.847 --> 44:14.262
Then one day she went out to buy some
brake pads for her Honda Gold Wing...

44:16.521 --> 44:20.162
And when she returned,
the cottage had been levelled.

44:22.960 --> 44:25.964
Everything that made up
her 73 years of life,

44:26.697 --> 44:29.177
all in one big pile of rubble.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.273
Can they do that?

44:32.436 --> 44:34.313
Oh, it was a mistake, they claimed.

44:34.372 --> 44:37.717
The contractor had bulldozed
the wrong house, they said.

44:38.476 --> 44:43.016
The contractor was fined, my mother got
quite a large sum in compensation,

44:43.114 --> 44:45.560
but within months she was dead.

44:46.817 --> 44:48.694
Died of a broken heart?

44:48.786 --> 44:50.788
No, it was a paragliding accident.

44:53.491 --> 44:56.631
Irwin is the local representative.
I mean, it may not be him.

44:56.694 --> 44:58.867
Oh, Irwin is behind this all right.

44:59.830 --> 45:04.074
I checked the records out of curiosity.
He's up to his old tricks again.

45:04.168 --> 45:08.514
The land around your market is owned by
Harbour Master Investments.

45:09.640 --> 45:12.052
And Harbour Master Investments
is owned by...

45:12.143 --> 45:13.816
PR Irwin.

45:13.878 --> 45:17.587
No, another company. Tiny Tool Limited.

45:18.883 --> 45:21.193
Whose shares are in the name of...

45:21.252 --> 45:22.993
PR Irwin.

45:23.054 --> 45:25.364
- No.
- Feck's sake.

45:25.423 --> 45:29.428
Three shareholders
who all are connected to...

45:31.095 --> 45:33.666
- PR lnuin.
- Feck it!

45:34.665 --> 45:38.704
So if we beat the Revenue, we beat Irwin.

45:40.705 --> 45:42.548
Are you on board, Mr Maydo Archer?

45:43.207 --> 45:46.416
Mrs Brown, has Mr Crews here
informed you about my condition?

45:47.211 --> 45:49.782
Condition? What condition?

45:50.047 --> 45:52.926
When under pressure,
lam prone to bouts of Tourette's.

45:53.017 --> 45:55.258
For fuck's sake. What the fuck is that?

45:55.853 --> 45:58.459
Nothing that might bother you. I'm in.

46:09.066 --> 46:10.909
I've got myself a lovely barrister.

46:12.103 --> 46:13.776
A very handsome-looking man.

46:15.106 --> 46:17.643
- Well, you know, you're never too old.
- Ha!

46:19.043 --> 46:23.082
Now Mary, when we get in here,
all you have to do is sign an affidavit,

46:23.147 --> 46:25.423
just to say that my granny paid her tax.

46:26.250 --> 46:28.059
That way my stall will be safe.

46:31.922 --> 46:33.959
Oh, for fuck's sake.

46:40.965 --> 46:44.412
You'd think in 102 years she'd have
learned to cross the fucking road.

46:44.468 --> 46:48.439
And so we lay to rest our dearly departed,

46:48.506 --> 46:51.180
Mary Moccasin, mother of seven...

46:51.275 --> 46:53.516
Mother of sorrows, look at her.

46:55.846 --> 46:58.793
Philomena, God love you,
you must be devastated.

46:59.450 --> 47:01.123
Not really.

47:01.185 --> 47:04.132
What a pity. Now we have
to find that receipt.

47:04.188 --> 47:05.826
Receipt?

47:05.923 --> 47:09.084
Well, if your grandmother paid it, they'll
have a receipt in the Revenue Office.

47:09.126 --> 47:12.699
She sold second hand
shoes and illegal fireworks from her stall.

47:12.797 --> 47:15.971
Let us all take a silent moment
now to recall...

47:16.033 --> 47:18.980
Father, move it. Faster, faster!

47:19.036 --> 47:21.107
- Lord hear us.
- Lord graciously hear us.

47:21.172 --> 47:22.981
As it is now and shall it always be,
world without end.

47:23.040 --> 47:24.678
Amen.

47:24.775 --> 47:26.448
In the name of the Father, Son,
the Holy Spirit. Amen.

47:26.510 --> 47:28.183
Go, go, go, go, go.

47:37.788 --> 47:40.064
- How do you do?
- Hello?

47:41.325 --> 47:42.998
Fuck.

47:45.396 --> 47:47.034
Two chips, one small cod.

47:50.368 --> 47:52.006
- Do you want salt and vinegar'?
- Yeah.

47:52.069 --> 47:54.208
Salt and vinegar on one, please.

48:04.548 --> 48:06.186
How do you do?

48:06.250 --> 48:08.753
We're looking to get a receipt
and we were told we could get it here.

48:08.853 --> 48:10.560
National Records Service.

48:10.654 --> 48:12.759
Yes, so this is the
National Records Service, then?

48:12.857 --> 48:14.837
- No, you're through to the wrong building.
- Oh.

48:14.892 --> 48:17.031
- What's this, then?
- Hello?

48:17.862 --> 48:19.535
Hello.

48:19.597 --> 48:21.270
National Records Service.

48:22.600 --> 48:24.375
Excuse me.

48:24.435 --> 48:28.906
Listen very carefully.
Is this the National Records Service?

48:29.006 --> 48:31.452
Yes, this is the National Record Service.

48:31.542 --> 48:34.386
- Shall we get a receipt here then?
- Hold on, please.

48:34.445 --> 48:36.083
- OK.
- OK what?

48:36.180 --> 48:37.853
- We're holding on.
- For what?

48:37.915 --> 48:39.553
You're going to show us
where to get the receipt.

48:39.617 --> 48:41.597
National Records Service.

48:41.685 --> 48:45.633
Listen, fuckface,
how do I see the actual receipts?

48:46.957 --> 48:49.437
- Get your feckin' hands off me!
- On your way, ladies.

48:49.527 --> 48:51.200
I have four sons.

48:51.462 --> 48:53.135
Now what?

48:53.230 --> 48:55.870
I don't know. We have to get in there.

48:56.901 --> 48:58.608
Maybe if you disguise yourself.

48:59.136 --> 49:00.809
- Disguise?
- Yeah.

49:01.405 --> 49:04.318
You could disguise yourself as a man.

49:06.811 --> 49:08.586
No, Winnie, I'd never get away with it.

49:08.646 --> 49:10.421
I know who'll get in there for us.

49:14.952 --> 49:16.932
It's all up to you now' son.

49:30.468 --> 49:32.778
So, what's the plan, Dermot?

49:32.837 --> 49:35.010
See that restricted area over there?

49:36.407 --> 49:38.114
Over there?

49:38.175 --> 49:39.848
Don't point!

49:41.011 --> 49:42.684
Sorry, Dermot.

49:42.780 --> 49:45.021
You walk over with me,
and when we get there,

49:45.115 --> 49:48.255
you do something to
distract the security guard.

49:48.319 --> 49:50.799
- I'll slip past him.
- You have it, Dermot.

50:23.854 --> 50:25.527
Can I help you?

50:26.557 --> 50:29.003
Yeah... No. I'm grand.

50:38.335 --> 50:40.474
You said a distraction.

50:40.538 --> 50:42.245
I know what I said.

50:45.075 --> 50:47.851
Dermot, I'll get that
receipt for your mammy.

50:48.579 --> 50:50.581
I have a plan. Do you want to hear it?

50:52.149 --> 50:54.356
Does it involve blind ninjas?

50:55.352 --> 50:57.764
- Maybe.
- Nope.

51:15.406 --> 51:17.181
OK, come on. Hully, hully.

51:17.241 --> 51:19.380
Oh, you squeezed my scrotum. Don't do that.

51:19.443 --> 51:22.049
K, follow me. Come on. Come on.

51:22.112 --> 51:24.217
Come on, hurry.

51:24.281 --> 51:29.287
OK, men, the camera and the
spotlight scans the area every 20 seconds.

51:29.386 --> 51:31.798
Once it passes, we have
to get to that door.

51:31.889 --> 51:36.770
We scale the railings first, and then
everybody wait for my "Go" before moving.

51:36.860 --> 51:38.806
- Excellent plan.

51:38.896 --> 51:41.103
OK'? So the word is "Go".

51:43.267 --> 51:45.975
- What the fuck?
- You said "Go"!

51:46.070 --> 51:48.107
I think he's dead. I can't feel a pulse.

51:48.205 --> 51:50.082
That's because you're holding his torch.

51:51.542 --> 51:53.818
- Pick him up and put him in the van.
- Right you are.

51:53.911 --> 51:57.415
Right, we still have four.
We can still make this a go.

52:00.718 --> 52:03.562
- What the fuck?
- Stop saying it.

52:03.621 --> 52:05.498
Saying what? "Go"?

52:09.093 --> 52:10.834
Oh, for fuck's sake.

52:13.464 --> 52:17.276
And you can call us on 0890107-252.

52:17.334 --> 52:21.009
Now In the studio with me today,
I have the wonderful Agnes Brown,

52:21.105 --> 52:23.449
Moore Street trader and mother of six.

52:25.776 --> 52:28.814
We've had many calls, Agnes,
from people who are full of admiration

52:28.912 --> 52:32.655
for, for you, not just
as a market stallholder

52:32.750 --> 52:35.196
but as a mother. A super mother.

52:35.486 --> 52:39.992
No, Joe, no, Joe, I'm just
an ordinary, well, you know...

52:40.090 --> 52:44.436
Now hang on. We've Melanie on line three.
Go ahead, Melanie. Talk to Joe.

52:44.795 --> 52:47.469
Agnes Brown is also a super mother

52:47.531 --> 52:50.034
to all of us who work a!
Moore Street Market.

52:50.134 --> 52:53.047
Without her we've no hope of
<i>keeping</i> Moore Street alive.

52:53.170 --> 52:58.381
She's our hero Joe, and a hero
to bring up six children all alone.

52:58.642 --> 53:01.145
She's right, Agnes. You are a hero.

53:01.211 --> 53:06.889
Oh, Joe, look, no, I'm not.... Well, yes,
it was difficult to, yes, it was, yeah.

53:06.984 --> 53:11.228
Well, in those days women would have
seen their children taken into care.

53:13.057 --> 53:14.798
What do you mean? What?

53:14.858 --> 53:17.134
I mean, I know they were different times,

53:17.194 --> 53:21.540
but if a parent passed away, their children
would have been taken into care.

53:21.632 --> 53:24.306
And yours were all babies, weren't they?

53:35.312 --> 53:38.225
Cheer up, Agnes, that receipt will turn up.

53:38.916 --> 53:40.657
It's not that.

53:41.585 --> 53:43.258
L...

53:45.489 --> 53:47.162
What?

53:48.759 --> 53:50.534
Well, you see, when Redser died...

53:50.594 --> 53:54.337
Well, I was living in London with Jacko
then, but I remember the telegram.

53:56.767 --> 53:58.542
I put the kids into care.

53:58.602 --> 54:00.275
What?

54:02.573 --> 54:05.577
They never mentioned it,
so I presumed they'd forgotten.

54:05.676 --> 54:10.056
But with all this talk about me being
the best mother in the world, and...

54:12.449 --> 54:14.190
I couldn't cope.

54:16.787 --> 54:18.892
Jesus, if they find out.

54:18.956 --> 54:20.629
Stop it now.

54:22.126 --> 54:25.403
Shush. There's no need for anyone to know.

54:30.367 --> 54:32.040
Good morning, Mrs Brown.

54:32.102 --> 54:33.740
Oh, Father Damien. How are you'?

54:33.804 --> 54:37.081
Grand, thanks. Sad about Mary, isn't it?

54:37.141 --> 54:40.611
Yes, very, very sad, Father.
Here, two euro, please.

54:42.880 --> 54:44.621
Father, are you doing confessions today?

54:45.149 --> 54:47.755
- I'm heading there right now. - l'll
follow you over in about five minutes.

54:47.818 --> 54:49.491
Grand.

54:57.895 --> 55:01.274
Annie, I have to go on an errand.
Keep an eye on the stall for me, will you?

55:01.498 --> 55:03.171
Do you need me to?

55:11.175 --> 55:13.314
Cathy, what are you doing?

55:13.410 --> 55:16.016
- I came down to see you.
- Can you hang on a few minutes?

55:16.280 --> 55:17.953
Sure.

55:18.015 --> 55:19.688
Thanks, love.

55:42.806 --> 55:45.013
- Are you there, Father?
- I am.

55:53.350 --> 55:55.489
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

55:55.552 --> 55:57.657
Go ahead.

55:57.721 --> 56:01.635
Father, everybody's talking about me
in the newspaper, the radio,

56:01.692 --> 56:03.672
as being the perfect mother.

56:05.562 --> 56:07.235
But I'm not.

56:08.031 --> 56:09.738
I've done a terrible thing.

56:10.367 --> 56:12.506
Just a second, Mrs Brown.

56:12.569 --> 56:15.072
What you've done, is it a sin?

56:16.006 --> 56:17.713
What?

56:17.808 --> 56:20.254
You don't have to tell me
anything unless it's a sin.

56:22.813 --> 56:24.520
Really think, now.

56:25.983 --> 56:28.520
Well, I don't know if it's a sin, but

56:28.585 --> 56:31.088
I put my children into care

56:31.188 --> 56:34.101
when they were babies,
when my husband died.

56:34.758 --> 56:36.431
I see.

56:36.526 --> 56:39.530
Well, that's no harm and no sin,

56:39.596 --> 56:41.234
so don't tell me any more.

56:41.331 --> 56:43.743
There is one sinful bit about it.

56:44.601 --> 56:48.242
I carried on collecting the children's
allowance while they were in care.

57:02.119 --> 57:04.463
Thank you very much, Father.
I feel much better.

57:13.130 --> 57:15.872
This is day one of the
court case that the country is dubbing

57:15.933 --> 57:17.708
Molly Malone versus Big Business,

57:17.768 --> 57:19.475
David versus Goliath.

57:19.569 --> 57:23.039
Muhammad Ali versus
anybody small who doesn't box.

57:23.106 --> 57:25.279
This could be the shortest
court battle on record,

57:25.375 --> 57:27.753
as it seems that once
the trader in question,

57:27.811 --> 57:30.121
mother of six, Mrs Agnes Brown,

57:30.213 --> 57:33.251
produces a receipt for the payment,
it's case over.

57:33.583 --> 57:35.893
Irma Byke at Dublin's courts.

57:36.987 --> 57:39.228
All rise for Justice Cannon.

57:44.294 --> 57:46.069
You may be seated.

57:48.165 --> 57:49.838
Do we have all the parties here?

57:50.167 --> 57:54.513
Yes, I am the
solicitor for the defendant, Tom Crews.

57:55.405 --> 57:57.248
And, Justice, I am Senior Counsel.

57:57.574 --> 58:00.646
- Let me guess. Tom Hanks?

58:00.744 --> 58:04.453
- Mr Maydo Archer.
- Mr Maydo Archer.

58:04.514 --> 58:07.358
I have not seen you in a
courtroom for a very long time.

58:07.451 --> 58:11.331
- Indeed, Justice.
- Do we still have that Tourette's thing?

58:11.421 --> 58:14.834
Not nearly as much, Justice. And I do
not anticipate it affecting this case.

58:14.925 --> 58:18.702
Ah, well, welcome back.
Who have we here for the State?

58:18.795 --> 58:21.639
Michael Gibney, solicitor, Justice. I...

58:22.632 --> 58:24.612
await Senior Counsel.

58:27.037 --> 58:28.710
Here, Justice.

58:29.139 --> 58:30.812
Wank, wank.

58:30.874 --> 58:32.615
What did
you say, Mr Maydo Archer?

58:32.676 --> 58:36.385
- He said "wank. wank".
- Nothing, Justice. Just clearing my throat.

58:36.480 --> 58:39.893
- A wank won't clear your throat, son.
- Agnes, shut up, please.

58:42.019 --> 58:44.693
- Good morning, Mrs Brown.
- Morning.

58:44.788 --> 58:47.064
I won't keep you very long.

58:47.157 --> 58:52.004
Mrs Brown, can you show the
court the receipt in question?

58:54.664 --> 58:57.338
- No.

58:57.401 --> 59:00.177
The receipt is in the National Records.

59:00.237 --> 59:04.014
But I was told by Philomena Nine Warts's
granny, Mary Moccasin,

59:04.074 --> 59:06.884
that she stood beside my
grandmother when she paid it.

59:07.244 --> 59:11.920
Well then, let's have Mrs Moccasin
up here to tell us that.

59:12.516 --> 59:14.189
She's dead.

59:15.719 --> 59:17.426
How unfortunate.

59:18.422 --> 59:23.201
Justice, with no receipt in
existence and no witness,

59:23.260 --> 59:25.501
well, I believe we're in
a position for judgement.

59:25.562 --> 59:27.235
Justice...

59:27.330 --> 59:30.903
Mrs Brown is a well-regarded member of the
community of traders in Moore Street.

59:32.736 --> 59:36.548
Her integrity as a stallholder
and as a mother is beyond reproach.

59:39.109 --> 59:41.521
"Beyond reproach"?

59:43.613 --> 59:46.457
Let's examine that, then, shall we?

59:50.220 --> 59:53.895
You don't mind a little examination,
Mrs Brown, do you?

59:53.957 --> 59:55.630
Not as long as I can leave my clothes on.

59:58.795 --> 01:00:02.641
Mrs Brown, this isn't the first time you
have defrauded the State of money, is it'?

01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:06.811
Silence in court, please!

01:00:08.238 --> 01:00:09.911
I beg your pardon.

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:14.321
I am referring to the weeks
after your husband's death,

01:00:14.644 --> 01:00:17.454
and the children's allowance you collected.

01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:19.424
MAYDO; Justice...

01:00:19.483 --> 01:00:21.485
This woman had just become a widow.

01:00:21.585 --> 01:00:24.725
She had six children at home to feed.

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:27.166
Mrs Brown was only collecting
what was rightfully hers.

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:30.767
- Silence, please! Silence!

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:35.666
Did you, Mrs Brown...

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:42.110
Did you have six children at home to feed?

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:56.631
Please answer the question, Mrs Brown.

01:00:57.754 --> 01:01:02.362
Did you have six children at home to feed?

01:01:06.296 --> 01:01:08.469
- No.

01:01:09.866 --> 01:01:11.607
That's correct.

01:01:12.536 --> 01:01:17.007
Because, in fact, you had put
your children into care!

01:01:17.107 --> 01:01:20.281
Will you be quiet, please!

01:01:21.778 --> 01:01:23.485
Isn't that correct?

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:27.021
Yes, I did.

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:33.566
- I'm so sorry.

01:01:33.657 --> 01:01:35.967
- Order! Order! Order!

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:42.165
Justice, I presume you are ready
to pass judgement on this.

01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:44.906
Mr Maydo Archer'?

01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:48.847
Justice' at the preliminary, fuck, hearing,

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:51.408
you asked us to produce, shit...

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:54.579
Produce the receipt in two weeks, wanks.

01:01:56.012 --> 01:01:58.583
Those two weeks end tomorrow.

01:01:58.682 --> 01:02:01.526
Gobble, gobble, nice, nice, give it a rub.

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:07.193
Reconvene tomorrow morning at 10:30 a.m.

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:28.919
What do you think of that?

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.953
- Think of what?
- Forget it.

01:02:33.617 --> 01:02:36.723
Right, lads, who wants to join me
in a real ninja mission?

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:38.527
Yes!

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:41.228
- Yeah!

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:42.964
Over here, lads.

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:58.953
It's too short.

01:03:01.044 --> 01:03:02.751
Pull me up.

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:10.325
Guys, you've got to see this.

01:03:12.155 --> 01:03:13.793
You gonna call the cops?

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:16.598
No, the Russians said to wait
till they were leaving.

01:03:17.661 --> 01:03:20.505
Nice one, lads.
Oh yeah, brilliant.

01:03:22.432 --> 01:03:24.105
Oh, sorry.

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:25.908
Excuse me.

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:28.911
I hope you're recording this, mate.

01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:31.475
This would get a million
hits before midnight.

01:03:31.574 --> 01:03:33.247
That's it.

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:36.784
Right' lads, I'm down.

01:03:37.013 --> 01:03:40.256
- How do we get down?
- Lt's not that high. Just drop.

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:04.374
You were all just babies,
and it was only for a couple of weeks.

01:04:05.275 --> 01:04:06.982
- I kinda remember.

01:04:07.711 --> 01:04:09.713
- I just thought we were on a holiday.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.853
Has Mammy come home, then?

01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:15.726
Then we need to get out there and find her.

01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:02.104
Mark, I have her. Tell the others.

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:04.739
See you at home.

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:10.943
Everybody's looking for you.

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:14.045
Are they?

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:16.021
You'd wonder why.

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:18.059
Because they're worried.

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:21.553
We want you home safe.

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:23.791
I wanted all youse home safe.

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:27.064
I just couldn't cope.

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:30.732
Mammy, it was what it was.

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:33.067
Nobody blames you.

01:05:35.965 --> 01:05:37.808
I do.

01:06:02.926 --> 01:06:04.928
You know, they asked me...

01:06:09.232 --> 01:06:10.905
The nuns.

01:06:13.503 --> 01:06:16.450
They asked me if I could manage
with any of youse.

01:06:17.841 --> 01:06:19.514
I said, "Maybe two."

01:06:22.679 --> 01:06:24.784
So they lined youse all up.

01:06:28.017 --> 01:06:30.327
And she said, "Pick two."

01:06:34.691 --> 01:06:36.364
I couldn't.

01:06:40.964 --> 01:06:42.773
Sophie's choice.

01:06:48.037 --> 01:06:49.948
Come on...

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.815
Let's get you home.

01:06:55.044 --> 01:06:56.887
Who the fuck is Sophie?

01:06:59.816 --> 01:07:03.025
OK, lads, now we're in,
how do we find the receipt?

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.859
It will be in a box.

01:07:14.831 --> 01:07:16.504
This is like walking in a maze.

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:19.046
If Mary Moccasin's receipt is 4-5-8,

01:07:19.135 --> 01:07:20.842
then it has to be 4-5-9.

01:07:20.904 --> 01:07:22.747
Hmm.

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:25.080
4-5-5.

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:29.316
4-5-6, 4-5-7, 4-5-8, 4-6-0.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.689
It's missing.

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:48.202
- The Russians must have got here before us.
- Russians, Dermot.

01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:50.676
Herro, Dermot. Dermot, it's gone.

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:54.271
- There's no receipt here.
- No receipt. 4-5-9 missing!

01:07:55.038 --> 01:07:57.245
Ask him did Liverpool win.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:05.089
Well, any news?

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:07.525
Still looking. They're still looking.

01:08:15.291 --> 01:08:18.033
You know, just before my father die...

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:21.770
He look into my eyes, and he say to me...

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:28.774
What does it say?

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:30.544
What, Joe?

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:32.917
The card. Mrs Moccasin's card.

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:34.649
What does it say? Read it.

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:37.747
Moccasin, paid 34 pounds.

01:08:37.814 --> 01:08:41.261
- Agent Betty Beacon.
- Betty Beacon.

01:08:41.317 --> 01:08:44.560
She was the first blind person
employed by the Irish Civil Service Board.

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:46.259
Brind?

01:08:46.322 --> 01:08:48.825
The government had to spend 500 pounds
on a Braille typewriter.

01:08:48.925 --> 01:08:50.598
So?

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:53.435
The Russians might have got
the regular typewritten receipt.

01:08:53.496 --> 01:08:55.270
There must also be one in Braille, too.

01:08:58.334 --> 01:09:00.006
We need to find the Braille section.

01:09:05.608 --> 01:09:07.609
Gregor, there's something
going on down here.

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:09.314
What do you mean?

01:09:09.412 --> 01:09:11.448
They're all going mad down there.

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:13.288
Where are they now'?

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:18.627
You're kidding me.

01:09:18.688 --> 01:09:20.497
Braille?

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:32.475
It's Buster.

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:35.109
Hello, Buster.

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:37.048
We have it, Dermo'. We have it!

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:38.813
Buster, are you there?

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:40.548
Shush, everybody.

01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:43.051
I think someone's coming.

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:49.492
Hey, you!

01:09:49.551 --> 01:09:51.691
Oh, shit. Gotta go, Dermo'.

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:53.495
Coppers! Everybody hide!

01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:04.208
Well?

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.211
I dunno. He was breaking up.

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:20.485
Right, let's get to the courts.

01:10:22.251 --> 01:10:24.390
I wanna go down to Moore Street first.

01:10:25.755 --> 01:10:27.757
I owe them all an apology.

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:31.499
If they're even talking to me.

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:34.704
I gave them all hope.

01:10:35.264 --> 01:10:36.937
"Good old Agnes."

01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:42.376
And then I let them all down.

01:10:42.939 --> 01:10:44.850
Want me to go with you?

01:10:44.941 --> 01:10:46.614
No.

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:50.747
This I have to do myself.

01:11:19.542 --> 01:11:21.249
Shit.

01:11:22.211 --> 01:11:23.884
That's that, then.

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:41.506
? When I am down

01:11:42.565 --> 01:11:45.842
? and, oh my soul, so weary

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:50.947
? When troubles come

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:54.418
? and my heart burdened be

01:11:56.179 --> 01:11:59.285
? Then, I am still

01:11:59.348 --> 01:12:01.828
? and wait here in the silence

01:12:04.854 --> 01:12:08.427
? Until you come and sit awhile with me ?

01:12:12.028 --> 01:12:13.769
We believe in you, Agnes!

01:12:38.721 --> 01:12:41.395
Right, let's face these fuckers.

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:43.670
Careful, your Tourette's is kicking in.

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:46.563
No, they're just fuckers.

01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:49.835
? You raise me up... ?

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:57.685
Buster, where are you?

01:12:58.174 --> 01:12:59.881
I'm in an air vent.

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:03.083
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:07.220
No, I'm still in an air vent.

01:13:22.431 --> 01:13:24.206
Mr Maydo Archer.

01:13:24.267 --> 01:13:28.181
I don't care what you do,
but delay everything as long as you can.

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:30.239
- What is it, Dermot?
- We have the receipt.

01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:32.114
I just need time to get it here.

01:13:32.208 --> 01:13:34.245
Oh, hold on, son.
You're not going anywhere without me.

01:13:34.343 --> 01:13:37.381
- What am I supposed to do?
- BAILIFF; All rise for Justice Cannon.

01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:43.529
You stay here and keep saying "Wank,
wank, gobble gobble" till I get back.

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:51.137
Ah, Mr Bluster. It no good.
I can't go no further.

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:54.468
You must leave me. Save yourself.

01:13:57.199 --> 01:13:59.042
OK. Good luck.

01:14:00.303 --> 01:14:04.217
Uh, Justice, before I call the witness...

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:08.119
I'd like to recount a little of
the history of traders in Dublin,

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:10.816
by way of context, if you see what I mean.

01:14:10.913 --> 01:14:12.950
I don't see what you mean, but carry on.

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:15.592
We need to do this quick, Dermot.

01:14:15.651 --> 01:14:19.997
Maydo Archer can only waffle for so long
with his "blonk, blonk, blank, blank."

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:22.660
Buster, I have the plans.
Listen very closely.

01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:24.465
Yeah, I'm going straight on.

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:28.437
Turn left at the next junction
and keep straight.

01:14:28.497 --> 01:14:30.170
Keep going. Keep going.

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:32.510
- I can feel the air, Dermot.
- That's it.

01:14:32.601 --> 01:14:34.603
Hurry, move towards the air vent.

01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:37.344
We need a screwdriver.

01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:43.183
I keep it for the bingo. You never know.

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:56.330
Dermo'.

01:14:57.693 --> 01:14:59.366
I have it.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:01.998
- Brilliant!
- I love you, Dermo'.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.207
Not so fast.

01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:09.679
I'll take that, thank you.

01:15:10.606 --> 01:15:14.952
Oh, son, no, please. You don't want
to hurt a poor defenseless old...

01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:16.854
- ...woman!

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:19.318
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:15:19.382 --> 01:15:21.453
How are we gonna get to the courtroom?

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:25.329
- We could take Mr Wang's car.
- Mr Wang! Mr Wang!

01:15:25.388 --> 01:15:27.388
- Don't leave me here!
- Mr Wang, you're all right.

01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:29.163
We won't go anywhere without you.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.863
- Fuck him, leave him there.

01:15:35.164 --> 01:15:36.837
Mr Bluster, I stuck!

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:42.576
Buster, only you could call this a car.

01:15:44.006 --> 01:15:45.815
Take your time. Oh...

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:47.650
That's nice. That's nice.

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:49.583
Hello. Oh!

01:15:53.516 --> 01:15:55.427
Left, left!
Right, right, right!

01:15:56.852 --> 01:15:58.889
Right, right! Jesus, right.

01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:02.026
Right, right, right. Left! Oh!

01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:07.104
Bye-bye.

01:16:09.832 --> 01:16:11.368
It was in 841 AD

01:16:11.434 --> 01:16:13.243
when the Vikings

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:17.750
first started trading in
Dovelinn, or "black pool",

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:21.049
from which, of course,
Dublin gets its name.

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:26.753
Justice, context is one thing,
but 841 AD, seriously?

01:16:26.849 --> 01:16:30.228
At least he didn't begin
"In the beginning there was Heaven".

01:16:30.286 --> 01:16:33.096
- Silence, please.

01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:37.365
I shall allow you a little leeway,
Mr Maydo Archer, but don't push me.

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:41.431
Well, of course, it was Hasculf
Thorgillsson who is well remembered for...

01:16:44.467 --> 01:16:46.242
lce cream!

01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:50.076
Balloons, balloons!

01:16:50.139 --> 01:16:52.141
What... Jesus Christ almighty...

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:55.987
I feel a little bit of wee coming out.

01:16:58.147 --> 01:16:59.820
Cops!

01:17:00.216 --> 01:17:02.628
Left, left, for feck's sake!

01:17:02.718 --> 01:17:06.291
Keep her going. Keep her going.
Go on, son, go on. We're in the clear.

01:17:08.224 --> 01:17:11.103
Wait, Russians. Stop.
Turn around, turn around.

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:13.668
Take it back.

01:17:15.564 --> 01:17:17.237
Go, go!

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.575
Hold it! More cops.

01:17:28.244 --> 01:17:30.349
- Now what do we do?
- I dunno.

01:17:33.983 --> 01:17:35.690
Where's that music coming from?

01:17:40.289 --> 01:17:41.996
Granddad!

01:17:42.258 --> 01:17:43.999
Come on, Granddad.

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:49.336
Oh...

01:17:58.874 --> 01:18:00.547
Jump!

01:18:01.377 --> 01:18:03.323
On three. Three!

01:18:03.546 --> 01:18:06.550
Ah! Mammy, mammy, mammy...

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:13.166
lam a swan.

01:18:13.222 --> 01:18:14.895
Timber!

01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:21.971
Shit! Every man for himself!

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:32.045
Leading us to where we are today.

01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:39.215
Thank you for that, Mr Maydo Archer.

01:18:39.315 --> 01:18:43.263
Do we have anything judicial to present?

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:46.889
I... Indeed I do, Justice.

01:18:49.325 --> 01:18:51.703
Perhaps I should call a witness?

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.501
Perhaps you should.

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:56.603
Come on, Mammy.

01:18:56.699 --> 01:18:58.770
Dermot, l think I have crabs.

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:03.376
- Move it, son. Move it.
- Oh, God.

01:19:07.376 --> 01:19:09.117
Shit! Russians!

01:19:09.211 --> 01:19:11.555
Russians, Russians. - Where?

01:19:11.614 --> 01:19:13.287
Come on.

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:19.891
- Now what?

01:19:20.956 --> 01:19:23.197
- Get in here, boys!
- No. Wait.

01:19:24.026 --> 01:19:26.199
Buster, give me the receipt.
We need to split up.

01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:27.935
You get them to chase you out of town.

01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:30.306
I'll get the receipt to the courts. Go!

01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:33.807
Go, go, go.

01:19:45.648 --> 01:19:48.151
I'm dry!

01:19:49.318 --> 01:19:50.991
I love the movies.

01:20:36.598 --> 01:20:40.205
I would like to call, uh, Mr Rory Brown.

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:49.178
I didn't do anything, Justice' I swear.

01:20:51.013 --> 01:20:52.686
I think I'm going to be sick.

01:20:52.781 --> 01:20:54.783
- Hold tight.

01:20:55.884 --> 01:20:58.364
Betty, you can just drop
us at the bus stop.

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:02.131
Seriously, Betty.
We don't mind taking a bus, do we, Buster?

01:21:02.624 --> 01:21:04.399
Buster. Busier!

01:21:07.996 --> 01:21:10.135
- Where is he?
- Cops.

01:21:11.233 --> 01:21:12.906
Russians.

01:21:22.411 --> 01:21:24.084
Get back in the fucking car.

01:21:31.587 --> 01:21:33.260
Receipt?

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:35.027
- Big Issue. Receipt?

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:36.763
Cash only.

01:21:55.711 --> 01:21:57.850
Shit!

01:21:58.113 --> 01:22:01.560
And I said, "Oh, there's an
awful smell off that."

01:22:02.684 --> 01:22:05.392
And he said, "If you think wife bad..."

01:22:05.454 --> 01:22:09.869
- Look what I have here in my hand!
- Yeah. Or something like that.

01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:13.065
Justice, I believe that the evidence
we've been waiting for has arrived.

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:24.243
20 euro each way Mia's Twin,

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:25.979
at 5 to 1.

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:30.082
Mrs Brown, this is a betting slip.

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:34.485
No. It can't be.

01:22:34.817 --> 01:22:38.321
Oh, Nelly, spank my monkey,
lick my love pump, fuck, fuck!

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:40.660
Call Mark.

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:51.800
Well done, Betty.
Now how do we keep this chase going?

01:22:52.568 --> 01:22:54.241
Piece of crap.

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:57.415
Buster gave my ma a betting slip.

01:22:58.106 --> 01:23:02.680
Shit! Now we have to find Buster
and get the receipt to the court.

01:23:03.445 --> 01:23:06.483
Not by car. The cops
have every road blocked.

01:23:07.249 --> 01:23:08.922
Now what will we do?

01:23:08.984 --> 01:23:11.965
- Dermo'!

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:14.466
Hi-ho, Silver! Away!

01:23:15.591 --> 01:23:17.298
It's a horse!

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:23.162
Mrs Brown' will you please tell the court
what you believe is going on here?

01:23:23.699 --> 01:23:26.179
Justice, this is irrelevant.

01:23:26.268 --> 01:23:30.307
There is no receipt, so the woman
should simply sell the stall

01:23:30.372 --> 01:23:33.376
for the 30,000 and let
that be the end of it.

01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:36.383
How do you know how much I was offered?

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:40.883
Mr lrwin, do we have
a con? ict of interest here?

01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:43.327
Certainly not.

01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:46.059
I was told by one of my researchers.

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:47.827
Whatever.

01:23:47.890 --> 01:23:50.564
Anyway, that is not the point here.

01:23:51.793 --> 01:23:54.672
Then we will hear what
Mrs Brown has to say.

01:23:59.902 --> 01:24:02.974
Buster, would this be the horse
you didn't steal?

01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:04.745
Maybe.

01:24:07.543 --> 01:24:09.318
It's a tough life

01:24:10.746 --> 01:24:13.659
standing at that stall, day in, day out.

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:17.730
Oh, it's beautiful on a sunny day.

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:21.334
The market is buzzing and

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:23.836
you stand there with a smile on your face,

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:26.839
and the sun beating down on your back.

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:29.102
But you try that in January,

01:24:29.932 --> 01:24:32.037
when the wind is whipping around your f...

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:33.773
Legs.

01:24:34.937 --> 01:24:37.213
And your hands are so cold

01:24:37.272 --> 01:24:39.377
you can't even make change.

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:43.450
And why do I do it?

01:24:45.047 --> 01:24:46.890
Because my mother did it.

01:24:46.949 --> 01:24:49.589
And her mother before her, and so on.

01:24:52.454 --> 01:24:54.695
It's not just about the stall.

01:24:57.626 --> 01:25:00.470
It's about being part of something bigger.

01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:04.804
It, it's about...

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:10.443
Dublin.

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:16.622
It's about being a part of Dublin.

01:25:19.648 --> 01:25:23.095
You won't find the real Dublin
in the financial centre,

01:25:23.151 --> 01:25:25.995
or the banks, or trendy nightclubs.

01:25:27.122 --> 01:25:29.227
Or even here in this court.

01:25:29.992 --> 01:25:32.097
The heart,

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.436
the pulse of real Dublin

01:25:34.896 --> 01:25:36.773
is in Moore Street.

01:25:39.668 --> 01:25:41.670
Look in the gallery here.

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:45.441
Immigrants from India, Nigeria, Pakistan,

01:25:45.507 --> 01:25:47.282
Iraq, Jamaica...

01:25:47.342 --> 01:25:49.344
I'm not fucking Jamaican!

01:25:51.346 --> 01:25:54.350
They've all blended
seamlessly into Dublin culture.

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:57.691
The new Dublin, they call it.

01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:01.497
But there isn't any new Dublin.

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:05.802
Moore Street has always welcomed the needy,

01:26:05.861 --> 01:26:09.934
the lonely, the lost of this city's people,

01:26:09.998 --> 01:26:12.376
and did so with an open heart.

01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:16.013
It doesn't matter who you are,

01:26:16.104 --> 01:26:18.710
you will be welcomed in Moore Street.

01:26:19.708 --> 01:26:22.552
It's something my mother is very proud of

01:26:23.478 --> 01:26:25.981
and something I will be proud of

01:26:26.882 --> 01:26:28.725
when it's my turn.

01:26:29.384 --> 01:26:32.365
When I take over the family stall
from my mother.

01:26:37.726 --> 01:26:40.400
There are those who would clear it out,

01:26:40.495 --> 01:26:45.535
put Moore Street away and morph this city
into a faceless copy of any other city.

01:26:47.636 --> 01:26:49.411
But they can't,

01:26:50.005 --> 01:26:52.007
and they won't.

01:26:52.474 --> 01:26:54.249
Because we won't let them.

01:26:57.713 --> 01:27:02.025
We are Moore Street
and we are going nowhere.

01:27:17.165 --> 01:27:20.942
So, then, no more evidence,
Mr Maydo Archer?

01:27:21.670 --> 01:27:23.343
Um...

01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:31.284
No, Justice.

01:27:37.352 --> 01:27:40.856
- We're screwed.
- No, we're not. Hold on, Dermo'.

01:27:47.195 --> 01:27:48.902
Yeah!

01:27:49.698 --> 01:27:51.405
Wife!

01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:57.077
I knew I could do it.

01:27:57.139 --> 01:28:00.086
You bastard. Don't ever try
anything like that again.

01:28:00.142 --> 01:28:03.055
- Please, not the stairs.
- Hold on, Dermo. Come on, giddy up!

01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:08.088
We have it!

01:28:17.159 --> 01:28:18.900
Hello, Buster.

01:28:19.327 --> 01:28:21.170
Justice Dickie.

01:28:21.263 --> 01:28:23.402
Back down the stairs on the right.

01:28:24.065 --> 01:28:25.806
Thank you.

01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:32.745
Despite the assertion of Mrs Brown
that this debt has been settled,

01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:35.652
there is no evidence to prove this.

01:28:36.678 --> 01:28:41.423
So then, in the matter of The Revenue
Department v. Mrs Agnes Brown...

01:28:48.924 --> 01:28:51.427
- What is this?
- Lt's the cavalry.

01:28:55.797 --> 01:28:58.141
- Or clowns.

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:00.373
Justice, here's the receipt.

01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:03.972
It's in Braille.

01:29:04.039 --> 01:29:06.610
Is there anyone in court who reads Braille?

01:29:08.476 --> 01:29:10.478
Don't fucking look at me.

01:29:10.679 --> 01:29:12.352
I read Braille.

01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:28.906
The court finds in favour of Mrs Brown.

01:30:07.869 --> 01:30:10.873
You see, it all works out
the way it's supposed to.

01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:06.128
Lovely kumquats, Brussels sprouts
and prickly pears!

01:31:06.227 --> 01:31:08.571
How are you, love?
You wanna feel my prickly pears?

01:31:10.332 --> 01:31:12.676
Come back quick, I'll give you a gobble.

01:31:14.502 --> 01:31:17.483
We won't use that last bit.
We won't use that last bit.

01:31:18.173 --> 01:31:21.017
Jesus, look, now you've killed her!

01:31:21.109 --> 01:31:22.782
How much?

01:31:27.849 --> 01:31:29.522
Release me.

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:35.967
It was my great, great grandmother
that started the stall.

01:31:36.024 --> 01:31:39.870
And it's been handed down ever since to
the eldest girl in the family.

01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:45.038
Since 1802.

01:31:50.305 --> 01:31:52.444
Somebody has a line, and it's not me.

01:31:59.381 --> 01:32:01.452
And action.

01:32:01.516 --> 01:32:03.223
How much?

01:32:04.219 --> 01:32:06.631
Four... Fucking shitbags.

01:32:07.389 --> 01:32:09.528
It's a lot to remember, take your time.

01:32:17.165 --> 01:32:18.838
Whoa.

01:32:19.634 --> 01:32:21.341
Hello, Buster.

01:32:22.137 --> 01:32:23.980
Sorry.

01:32:24.039 --> 01:32:26.747
Goodbye, Buster.

01:32:28.309 --> 01:32:30.186
Well, you've certainly made a splash.

01:32:30.245 --> 01:32:32.418
I've no time for that shite, Annie.

01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:36.255
Fresh fruit and vegetables!

01:32:36.885 --> 01:32:38.865
As seen on TV.

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:52.071
- Look, now you've killed her.
- How much?

01:33:00.008 --> 01:33:02.614
- Ladies and gentlemen, Ben Kellett.
- Yeah!

01:33:04.612 --> 01:33:06.558
Jesus Christ, if they find out.

01:33:07.382 --> 01:33:09.055
Stop it now.

01:33:10.885 --> 01:33:14.799
Shush, there's no need for
anyone to find... To know.

01:33:14.889 --> 01:33:16.562
- To find to know'?
- To find to know.

01:33:20.361 --> 01:33:22.136
Mammy, shut up.

01:33:25.467 --> 01:33:27.879
I'm getting an itch around my anus.

01:33:27.936 --> 01:33:30.280
You should see someone about that.

01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:32.248
Would it be thrush?

01:33:34.876 --> 01:33:37.447
Set and action.

01:33:37.545 --> 01:33:39.218
How much?

01:33:43.418 --> 01:33:45.091
Keep rolling, keep rolling.

01:33:45.153 --> 01:33:48.259
- Why does she keep repeating herself?
- Lt's the phone thing.

01:33:48.323 --> 01:33:50.599
National Records Service.

01:33:50.658 --> 01:33:53.264
Excuse me, fucker-face.

01:33:53.328 --> 01:33:56.070
How do I get to see the actual receipts?

01:34:02.837 --> 01:34:04.612
I landed right on my cock.
