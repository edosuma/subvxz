OLIVIA: I'M STILL
NOT SURE IF ANYONE'S
ACTUALLY LISTENING TO ME.

00:03.050 --> 00:05.550
-NOBODY IS.
-SHUT UP, JORDAN.

00:07.510 --> 00:10.060
WELCOME TO "LIV THE TRUTH."

00:10.060 --> 00:14.940
I STARTED THIS PODCAST BECAUSE
NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE KNOW

00:14.940 --> 00:17.230
WHAT'S HAPPENING OUTSIDE OF
THEIR OWN LITTLE WORLD.

00:17.230 --> 00:22.780
AND UNTIL RECENTLY,
I WAS ONE OF THEM.

00:22.780 --> 00:26.660
BUT THAT CHANGED AFTER THE
INCIDENT WITH CRENSHAW CATHY,

00:26.660 --> 00:31.700
THE OWNER OF THE NOW DAILY
PICKETED BUNCH-O FRO-YO.

00:31.700 --> 00:33.750
THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED

00:33.750 --> 00:36.460
I WAS LIVING IN MY BEVERLY HILLS
BUBBLE.

00:43.670 --> 00:49.350
BECAUSE I'M CUT OFF
FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD,

00:49.350 --> 00:53.020
BUT THERE'S A WORLD OUT THERE
WHERE PEOPLE AREN'T SO LUCKY,

00:53.020 --> 00:57.690
A WORLD WHERE YOU CAN'T BARBECUE
WHILE BLACK,

00:57.690 --> 01:02.190

BUY MENTOS WHILE BLACK,

01:02.190 --> 01:05.150

01:08.160 --> 01:10.410
GET ON AN ELEVATOR WHILE BLACK,

01:10.410 --> 01:12.370
SWIM IN YOUR POOL WHILE BLACK,

01:12.370 --> 01:15.040
STUDY IN YOUR COLLEGE DORM

01:25.010 --> 01:27.760

01:27.760 --> 01:31.300
WELL, I WANT THESE TO STOP.

01:31.300 --> 01:36.730
THIS WORLD IS NOT OK.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.150
AND IT'S A LOT CLOSER
THAN YOU THINK.

01:39.150 --> 01:44.530

YOU CAN SAY
"NICE PASS," RIGHT?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.410
NICE PASS.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.750

02:04.170 --> 02:06.340
REALLY? 'CAUSE THE PERSON
I SAW OUT THERE

02:06.340 --> 02:08.010
AIN'T LOOK LIKE HE WAS DONE.

02:16.810 --> 02:18.810
I KNOW HE WOULDN'T
WANT ME TO QUIT.

EVERYTHING I LOVED
ABOUT THE GAME

02:22.770 --> 02:24.900

ON THE FIELD,

WALK AWAY FROM THIS, FAM.

THERE WAS ALWAYS GONNA
BE AN AFTER FOOTBALL, MAN.

SOONER THAN I THOUGHT.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.080
OLIVIA: EVERYONE DESERVES
TO FEEL SAFE--

02:40.080 --> 02:43.840

SAFE FROM POLICE BRUTALITY,

GANG VIOLENCE,

02:45.710 --> 02:48.300
JUST SAFE TO BE.

02:55.140 --> 02:58.390

MM.

03:07.940 --> 03:09.400

TOGETHER.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.700

WHATEVER.

03:13.030 --> 03:14.820

OH. STOP. NO.

CHECK MYSELF BACK IN.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.670
NO. DON'T YOU DARE.
YOU'RE COMING TO MY
COTILLION.

03:27.670 --> 03:30.880
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU'RE
EXCITED FOR A FANCY BALL.

03:30.880 --> 03:32.430
WHO SAID I WAS EXCITED?

03:32.430 --> 03:34.090
I MEAN, IF I HAVE TO TRY ON

03:34.090 --> 03:35.470
ONE MORE PAIR
OF FRILLY WHITE GLOVES,

03:35.470 --> 03:37.760
I WILL CUT MY HANDS OFF
IN PROTEST.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.310
YOU WOULD STILL NEED
GLOVES FOR THE STUMPS,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

03:39.310 --> 03:41.270
-THAT'S TRUE.
-NO?

03:41.270 --> 03:43.650
HEY, SHE'S BEEN DREADING
THIS THING SINCE SHE
HEARD ABOUT IT.

03:43.650 --> 03:45.440
WHY? I THINK IT'S
GONNA BE FUN.

ASHER, AND I

03:49.150 --> 03:50.440
HAVE TO BE THERE
EARLY TO LINE UP

03:50.440 --> 03:51.530

PRESENTATION.

03:51.530 --> 03:53.110

UH, KIA DIDN'T HAVE
AN ESCORT,

03:55.320 --> 03:57.200

OLIVIA: UH, YOU'RE
DEFINITELY THE BEAST,

04:08.290 --> 04:10.340
BUT ONLY BECAUSE YOU'VE
BEEN WORKING OUT SO MUCH.

04:10.340 --> 04:12.170
YOU BEEN HITTING IT
PRETTY HARD?

04:12.170 --> 04:14.720
OLIVIA: ONLY IF 2 OR 3 TIMES
A DAY IS PRETTY HARD.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.140
SPENCER: 3?

04:16.140 --> 04:19.100
WELL, YOU LEFT BIG
CLEATS TO FILL, MAN.

04:19.100 --> 04:20.680
WE'RE NOT ALL SPENCER JAMES.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.560
I MEAN, YOU COULD'VE TAKEN
A BREAK

04:22.560 --> 04:25.270
TO MAKE AT LEAST ONE
OF MY DANCE PRACTICES.

04:25.270 --> 04:27.190
I MEAN, THAT'S EXERCISE,
TOO, YOU KNOW?

04:27.190 --> 04:29.360
YOU SAID IT WAS
EASY TO LEARN, SO...

04:29.360 --> 04:32.530
IT IS, BUT THERE'S
ONLY ONE PRACTICE LEFT.

04:32.530 --> 04:35.910
AND I WILL BE THERE.

04:35.910 --> 04:39.780
THE BEAST WILL BE READY,
I PROMISE.

-FANCIFIED?
-YEAH, IT'S A WORD.

04:53.010 --> 04:54.420

04:54.420 --> 04:56.510
THAT'S A VERY
SPECIFIC DEFINITION.

04:56.510 --> 04:59.010
I'VE BEEN RESEARCHING.
I EVEN GOOGLED "COTILLION."

04:59.010 --> 05:01.640
IT'S A COMING-OUT PARTY,
LIKE A FREE GAY PROM.

05:01.640 --> 05:03.930
HOW PERFECT IS THAT?

05:03.930 --> 05:06.390
I DON'T THINK I'VE
EVER SEEN YOU THIS
EXCITED BEFORE.

05:06.390 --> 05:10.400
LOOK, I JUST WANT US
TO GET OUT AND HAVE
A GOOD TIME.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.070
IT'S BEEN A WHILE,
YOU KNOW?

05:12.070 --> 05:14.030
YEAH.

05:14.030 --> 05:15.610
I'M SURE IT'LL BE FUN.

05:15.610 --> 05:17.530
YOU DON'T SEEM SO SURE.

05:17.530 --> 05:19.240
I'M GOOD, REALLY.

05:19.240 --> 05:22.790
I WILL TRY TO GET ALL
HOTIFIED FOR YOU.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.410
YEAH, THAT'S NOT A WORD.

05:24.410 --> 05:25.830
IT'S NOT?

05:30.080 --> 05:31.880
-OOH.
-UH-HUH.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.010
I'LL BET YOU
NEVER GET TIRED
OF SEEING THAT.

05:34.010 --> 05:36.420
MAN, I SEE IT EVERY NIGHT
WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES.

05:36.420 --> 05:40.010
YEAH. I WORE MY
SUPER BOWL RING ON
A CHAIN AROUND MY NECK

05:40.010 --> 05:42.680

BEFORE I REALIZED
HOW STUPID I LOOKED.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.390

HAVING ME OUT
HERE THIS WEEK.

05:44.390 --> 05:46.350
AH, NO PROBLEM.

05:46.350 --> 05:48.100
YEAH, MAN, RETIREMENT
HASN'T BEEN
WHAT I THOUGHT.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.810
I, UH, STARTED
A GARDEN.

05:49.810 --> 05:52.270
I EVEN HAVE
A LEMON TREE.
I HATE LEMONS.

05:52.270 --> 05:55.900
HA HA! WELL, MY BOYS
ARE GONNA GO NUTS
ONCE THEY SEE YOU.

05:55.900 --> 05:57.780
WHAT MADE, UH--WHAT
MADE YOU REACH OUT?

05:57.780 --> 05:59.660
I WANTED TO CHECK OUT
YOUR PROGRAM.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.280
IF IT'S AS GOOD
AS I HEAR,

06:01.280 --> 06:02.410

06:27.600 --> 06:29.310

06:29.310 --> 06:32.060

SAY WE LOOK ALIKE...

HOW DID YOU--HOW
DID YOU GET HIM?

06:46.700 --> 06:48.160
HE CAME TO US.

06:49.290 --> 06:51.170
BILLY: YEAH.

07:03.470 --> 07:05.300
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

07:05.300 --> 07:08.060
WHY WOULDN'T I BE HERE?
THE FOOD BAD OR SOMETHING?

07:08.060 --> 07:10.940
NEVER HAD
TRUFFLE FRIES.

07:10.940 --> 07:13.520
GOT TO BE BETTER
THAN THE CRAP THEY
SERVE IN JAIL.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.560
I'LL GET YOU
SOMETHING TO GO.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.440
YOU EVER BEEN TO JAIL?

07:16.440 --> 07:18.440
NAH, I DIDN'T THINK SO.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.110
ANYBODY TRY TO TAKE
YOUR FUTURE AWAY?

07:21.110 --> 07:23.160
YOU DID THAT TO
YOURSELF, TY.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.450
NAH. ACTUALLY, I HAD
A LITTLE HELP,

07:25.450 --> 07:29.200
BUT IT DON'T MATTER
MUCH SEEING THAT I'M
A FREE MAN NOW.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.170

GOOD THESE DAYS.

07:32.170 --> 07:34.960
CAN'T SAY THE SAME FOR

07:34.960 --> 07:36.920
OR YOUR LITTLE
BOYFRIEND COOP.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.880

07:38.880 --> 07:40.920
IT'S A DAMN SHAME.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.760

07:42.760 --> 07:45.510
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T
WANT TO EAT HERE NO MORE.

07:45.510 --> 07:49.770
THE PLACE SEEMS
A LITTLE SKETCHY.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.810
LIFE'S TOO SHORT.

08:04.900 --> 08:06.440
CAN I OPEN MY EYES NOW?

08:06.440 --> 08:07.730
I NEVER TOLD YOU
TO CLOSE THEM.

08:07.730 --> 08:09.980
I JUST SAID I HAD
A GIFT FOR YOU.

08:09.980 --> 08:12.150
YES, YOU CAN OPEN THEM.

08:12.150 --> 08:13.610

PLEASE DON'T LET IT BE
SOME PINK, FRILLY
PRINCESS THING.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.790
OPEN IT.

08:27.630 --> 08:30.630
DANG. I--I--

08:30.630 --> 08:32.630
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO SAY.

08:32.630 --> 08:35.470
YOU CAN START BY APOLOGIZING
FOR INSULTING MY TASTE

08:35.470 --> 08:36.640
AND THEN END WITH
"THANK YOU."

08:36.640 --> 08:39.140
I'M SO, SO SORRY, MA.

08:39.140 --> 08:41.390
BUT THANK YOU, THANK
YOU, THANK YOU.

08:41.390 --> 08:45.730
I LOVE IT. THIS IS
SO DOPE. WHAT!

08:49.730 --> 08:52.240
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, MA.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.610
OK.

08:55.740 --> 08:57.780
-HA HA!
-PATIENCE.

08:57.780 --> 08:59.200
OH, HEY.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.040
YOU DIDN'T GET MY
TEXT EARLIER?

09:01.040 --> 09:03.620
UH, YEAH, SORRY. UH,
LUNA, THIS IS MY GIRL COOP.

09:03.620 --> 09:05.830
AND, COOP, THIS IS
MY FRIEND LUNA.

09:05.830 --> 09:07.960
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOU
WERE DATING SOMEONE

09:07.960 --> 09:10.090
AND THAT SHE'S STUNNING.

09:10.090 --> 09:11.710
PATIENCE: WELL, YOU DIDN'T TELL
ME YOU WERE COMING TO TOWN.

09:11.710 --> 09:13.420
I KNOW HOW YOU
LIKE SURPRISES.

09:13.420 --> 09:14.800
PATIENCE: OK, SO LUNA JUST
CAME BACK FROM COLLEGE

09:14.800 --> 09:17.180
FOR THE COTILLION. SO...

09:17.180 --> 09:19.390
OH, OK. YOU PART OF
THE SoLA MUSE?

09:19.390 --> 09:21.640
MM-HMM. COTILLIONAIRE
FOR LIFE. YOU?

09:21.640 --> 09:24.020
NAH. MY HOMEGIRL OLIVIA
INVITED US, SO...

09:24.020 --> 09:25.890
WE CAN'T PASS UP ON
THOSE LITTLE HOT DOGS.

09:25.890 --> 09:27.770
HA HA. YEAH.

09:27.770 --> 09:29.690
COOP: BUT, ANYWAY, I'LL LET
YOU ALL FINISH CATCHING UP.

09:29.690 --> 09:31.820
OK. UH, I'LL CALL
YOU LATER, YEAH?

09:31.820 --> 09:33.820
-MM-HMM.
-BYE.

09:33.820 --> 09:37.110
BYE.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.620
LUNA: SHE'S SO PRETTY.

09:46.120 --> 09:49.630
WHOO-HOO-HOO. WHOO!

09:51.340 --> 09:52.460
YO, SPENCER IS GONNA
FREAK OUT WHEN HE

09:52.460 --> 09:54.010
HEARS ABOUT THIS.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.720
WELL, HOPEFULLY,
NOT AS MUCH AS YOU.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.840
MAYBE TAKE IT DOWN
A NOTCH.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.720
WHATEVER, MAN.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.890
HEY, YOU USED TO PRETEND
TO BE HIM WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

10:01.890 --> 10:03.140
I STILL DO.

10:03.140 --> 10:04.850
MAYBE DON'T SAY THAT TO HIM.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.150
MATT: HEY, HOLD UP, BOYS.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.730
YOU KNOW WHAT I SEE
WHEN I LOOK AT YOU TWO?

10:11.730 --> 10:14.650
THE HEART AND SOUL
OF THIS TEAM.

10:14.650 --> 10:17.150
WHEN THE EAGLES WIN
STATE AGAIN, IT'LL BE
BECAUSE OF YOU TWO.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.030
YOU HAVE THIS GREAT
RHYTHM OUT HERE.

10:19.030 --> 10:20.740
BUT I THINK WITH
A LITTLE HELP FROM ME,

10:20.740 --> 10:22.370
YOU CAN BOTH GO D-I.

10:22.370 --> 10:24.740
I WOULD DO ANYTHING
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

10:24.740 --> 10:26.790
YOU THINK YOU CAN WORK
THAT KIND OF MAGIC
IN JUST A FEW DAYS?

10:26.790 --> 10:28.460
THAT MIGHT BE
PUSHING IT,

10:28.460 --> 10:30.580
BUT DEFINITELY BY
NEXT SEASON.

10:30.580 --> 10:35.260
WE CAN START TODAY
IF YOU BOYS WANT
TO STICK AROUND.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.760
NAH, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
AT A DANCE PRACTICE.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.760
MY BAD, BILLY ELLIOT.

10:40.760 --> 10:43.350
THOUGHT YOU
WANTED TO BE
A FOOTBALL PLAYER.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.930
IT'S FINE. I CAN--
I CAN MISS IT.

10:47.930 --> 10:48.850
OK.

10:54.900 --> 10:56.820
DOWN. SET.

10:56.820 --> 10:58.740
WIDE 60...

10:58.740 --> 10:59.990
HUT.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.370
TEAM'S LOOKING GOOD,

11:06.370 --> 11:09.000
BUT MATT SPRINGER
ISN'T SPENCER JAMES.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.540
YOU MAY HAVE TO GIVE UP
YOUR BEDROOM IF YOU WANT
HIM TO PLAY FOR YOU.

11:11.540 --> 11:12.830
YOU'RE FUNNY.

11:12.830 --> 11:14.790
YOU'RE ALSO
ON MY FIELD.

11:14.790 --> 11:17.010
YOU CAN GET AN AUTOGRAPH
IN THE PARKING LOT

11:17.010 --> 11:18.760
'CAUSE, UH, PRACTICES
ARE OFF-LIMITS.

11:18.760 --> 11:22.430
WOW. EVEN TO THE MAN
WHO GOT A NFL STAR

11:22.430 --> 11:24.300
TO COME ON OUT TO BEVERLY?

11:26.510 --> 11:28.930
WAIT. YOU--YOU DIDN'T
THINK HE WAS HERE
BECAUSE OF YOU, DID YOU?

11:28.930 --> 11:30.850
HA HA! OH, NO.

11:30.850 --> 11:32.940
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
ACCEPT THE FACT THAT

11:32.940 --> 11:35.400
I'M GONNA RUN
MY TEAM MY WAY?

11:35.400 --> 11:37.230
YOU CAN GO AHEAD
AND BRING ON

11:37.230 --> 11:38.990
THE DALLAS COWBOY
CHEERLEADERS
FOR ALL I CARE.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.990
IT AIN'T GONNA MAKE
NO DIFFERENCE.

11:40.990 --> 11:42.450
MY BOYS CAN'T BE BOUGHT.

11:42.450 --> 11:44.990
JORDAN: HEY, DAD.
BILLY: YEAH?

11:44.990 --> 11:46.990
UM, IS IT COOL IF I
SKIP THE MOVIE TONIGHT?

11:46.990 --> 11:48.790
SPRINGER WANTS
TO RUN ROUTES
WITH ME AND ASH.

11:48.790 --> 11:49.950
-YEAH. OK.
-COOL?

11:49.950 --> 11:51.750
-YUP.
-THANK YOU.

11:51.750 --> 11:55.250
HEH! AH, YOU SURE
ABOUT THAT, COACH?

11:57.960 --> 12:00.050
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.
ONE MORE TIME.
ONE MORE TIME.

12:00.050 --> 12:02.590
ONE MORE TIME, GUYS.

12:02.590 --> 12:04.840
COOP: PATIENCE WAS JUST
STANDING THERE

12:04.840 --> 12:06.890
WHILE THIS HIPPIE MOON
GODDESS WAS CRAWLING
ALL OVER HER.

12:06.890 --> 12:08.970
LOOK, PATIENCE
WOULDN'T DO YOU
DIRTY, ALL RIGHT?

12:08.970 --> 12:10.980
YOU SHOULD TALK TO HER.
I'LL COME WITH YOU
IF YOU WANT.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.350
BRO, YOU BEEN FOLLOWING
ME AROUND LIKE A LOST-ASS
PUPPY LATELY.

12:13.350 --> 12:15.400
I CAN TALK TO MY
GIRLFRIEND BY MYSELF.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.020
WELL, EXCUSE ME FOR
WANTING SOME COOP TIME.

12:17.020 --> 12:18.440
WE NEVER HANG
NO MORE.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.990
WE JUST HUNG YESTERDAY
AND THE DAY BEFORE THAT.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.240
LOOK, SPENCE. LOOK,
I CAN TAKE YOU

12:23.240 --> 12:24.990
WITHOUT A GIRLFRIEND
OR WITHOUT FOOTBALL.

12:24.990 --> 12:27.830
BUT WITHOUT EITHER, BRO,
YOU TOO DAMN MUCH.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.830
WHY YOU BEEN ACTING
SO WEIRD LATELY?

12:29.830 --> 12:31.870
YOU SEEN TYRONE?

12:31.870 --> 12:34.580
NO. AND I AIN'T BEEN
LOOKING FOR HIM NEITHER.

12:34.580 --> 12:36.380
AIN'T YOU THE ONE
THAT TOLD ME,
FORGET ABOUT HIM?

12:36.380 --> 12:39.670
YEAH. MAYBE I WAS WRONG.

12:39.670 --> 12:42.050
HE ROLLED THROUGH MY WORK,
MAKING CRYPTIC THREATS.

12:42.050 --> 12:44.300
IF TYRONE GONNA DO
SOMETHING TO ME,
HE GONNA DO IT.

12:44.300 --> 12:46.640
AIN'T NO SENSE
IN WORRYING ABOUT IT.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.050
I MEAN, LIKE
EVERYBODY SAID,

12:48.050 --> 12:51.390
I GOT TO LIVE MY LIFE
BY MYSELF.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.730
EH. YOU STAY.

12:57.730 --> 12:59.070
IT'S LIKE THAT?

13:05.950 --> 13:08.120
THANKS
FOR MEETING ME.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.870
ALL GOOD, LOVED ONE.

13:09.870 --> 13:11.120
THINK I KNOW WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.080
TYRONE BEEN POPPING UP
ALL OVER THE HOOD,

13:13.080 --> 13:14.870
BRAGGING ABOUT BEATING
THOSE CHARGES.

13:14.870 --> 13:16.540
HE POPPED UP IN
BEVERLY HILLS, TOO,

13:16.540 --> 13:18.040
TALKING SOME NONSENSE
ABOUT THE FUTURE

13:18.040 --> 13:19.250
AND THE FOLKS WHO
SET HIM UP.

13:19.250 --> 13:21.000
SO SPEAK ON IT. WHAT
YOU NEED FROM ME?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.340
MY MOMS AND DILLON
IS OUT OF TOWN.

13:23.340 --> 13:24.880
AND I THINK MRS. BAKER IS
SAFE IN BEVERLY HILLS,

13:24.880 --> 13:26.470
BUT I'M WORRIED
ABOUT COOP.

13:26.470 --> 13:29.220
PSSH. I GOT EYES
ALL OVER THE HOOD.

13:29.220 --> 13:31.140
LOOK, I APPRECIATE YOU,
BUT YOU AND YOUR BOYS
CAN'T BE EVERYWHERE, MAN.

13:31.140 --> 13:32.720
TRUE THAT. WE CAN'T.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.850
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS FOR.

13:34.850 --> 13:36.980
STAY UP, MAN.

14:00.580 --> 14:02.630
I AIN'T TOUCHED A GUN
MY WHOLE LIFE,

14:02.630 --> 14:04.210
AND I AIN'T ABOUT
TO START NOW.

14:04.210 --> 14:05.550
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
FLIP WAS THINKING.

14:05.550 --> 14:07.470
YOU KNOW WHO HE IS.

14:07.470 --> 14:08.880
HE'S BEEN LIVING THAT LIFE
SINCE HE WAS OUR AGE.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.640
WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING?

14:10.640 --> 14:12.890
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M TIRED
OF FEELING HELPLESS.

14:12.890 --> 14:16.430
WELL, THAT'S WHAT MY UNCLE
WAS TRYING TO DO--HELP.

14:16.430 --> 14:19.650
HE KNOWS GUYS LIKE TYRONE
ONLY RESPOND TO INTIMIDATION.

14:19.650 --> 14:23.270
INSTRUCTOR: BREATHE, EVERYONE.
RELAX INTO THE DANCE.

14:29.190 --> 14:32.070
IT'S FINE. JUST
PRETEND I'M NOT HERE

14:32.070 --> 14:34.780
JUST LIKE MY BOYFRIEND.

14:36.610 --> 14:39.070
-YOU OK?
-MM-HMM.

14:39.070 --> 14:41.740
LOOK, I CAN DANCE
WITH YOU AGAIN.

14:41.740 --> 14:43.660
OR THERE'S ALWAYS
MRS. PHILPOTT.

14:43.660 --> 14:45.790
HEAD UP. NICE.

14:45.790 --> 14:48.460
-YEAH. SHE'S TOO HANDSY.
-HA HA.

14:48.460 --> 14:50.210
AT THIS POINT, I'VE
PRACTICED ENOUGH THAT

14:50.210 --> 14:51.710
I CAN DO ASHER'S PART, TOO.

14:51.710 --> 14:54.760
AND LOOKS LIKE I'M
GONNA HAVE TO.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.670
I'M SURE HE HAS
A GOOD REASON
FOR BAILING.

14:56.670 --> 14:58.340
HE SAID HE HAD TO STAY
AFTER PRACTICE

14:58.340 --> 15:00.720
TO WORK WITH SOME GUY
NAMED MATT SPRINGER.

15:00.720 --> 15:03.720
MATT SPRINGER'S
AT THEIR PRACTICE?

15:03.720 --> 15:06.480
I MEAN, YEAH. HE SHOULD
BE HERE.

15:08.730 --> 15:11.690
I'M GONNA NEED TO
FIND ANOTHER ESCORT
IF IT ISN'T TOO LATE.

15:11.690 --> 15:13.270
WHAT'S JORDAN
DOING?

15:13.270 --> 15:14.860
EW. NO, I AM NOT
GOING WITH MY BROTHER.

15:14.860 --> 15:16.490
NO. I MEANT MAYBE I
COULD GO WITH HIM

15:16.490 --> 15:18.030
AND SPENCER COULD
TAKE YOU.

15:18.030 --> 15:19.860
YOU'D BE ALL RIGHT
WITH THAT?

15:19.860 --> 15:22.490
IF JORDAN IS.
HE'S CUTE.

15:22.490 --> 15:24.660
SPENCER,
WHAT YOU THINK?

15:24.660 --> 15:26.080
I MEAN, HE'S ALL RIGHT.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.170
YOU DON'T THINK ASHER STILL
HAS TIME TO LEARN THE DANCE?

15:30.170 --> 15:32.880
NO. HE HAS HAD
PLENTY OF TIME.

15:32.880 --> 15:36.130
I NEED SOMEONE
I CAN COUNT ON.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.930
WHERE'S ASHER?

15:44.930 --> 15:47.140
JORDAN: WHOA!
BOUNDARIES, LIV.

15:47.140 --> 15:49.310
LIV, WHAT THE HELL?

15:49.310 --> 15:50.890
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK
FOR COTILLION. I FOUND
ANOTHER ESCORT.

15:50.890 --> 15:53.150
W--WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:53.150 --> 15:55.400
I ASKED IF IT WAS OK THAT
I SKIPPED THE PRACTICE.
YOU SAID IT WAS FINE.

15:55.400 --> 15:56.940
WHAT WAS I
SUPPOSED TO SAY?

15:56.940 --> 15:59.530
"PLEASE DON'T BREAK YOUR
PROMISE TO ME AGAIN"?

15:59.530 --> 16:02.820
UH, YES. OR EVEN,
"NO, IT'S NOT FINE."
AT LEAST I WOULD'VE KNOWN.

16:02.820 --> 16:05.700
WHAT GUY DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT "FINE" MEANS?

16:05.700 --> 16:08.790
YOU REALLY WANTED ME
TO PASS UP THE CHANCE TO WORK
WITH A SUPER BOWL MVP?

16:08.790 --> 16:11.790
NO. I WANTED YOU
TO CARE ABOUT WHAT'S
IMPORTANT TO ME, TOO.

16:11.790 --> 16:14.210
I DO, BUT THIS IS
MY FUTURE THAT WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT, LIV, OK?

16:14.210 --> 16:16.300
NOT SOME DANCE FOR SOME
STUPID CLUB YOU

16:16.300 --> 16:18.880
DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO JOIN
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.720
WELL, IF THAT'S REALLY
HOW YOU FEEL,

16:22.720 --> 16:25.890
THEN IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU'RE NOT GOING.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.560
LIV, WAIT. I'M--

16:37.020 --> 16:38.430
YOUR FRIEND LUNA
SEEMS COOL.

16:38.430 --> 16:42.230
YEAH. YOU COULD'VE
JOINED US, YOU KNOW?

16:42.230 --> 16:45.520
YOU DIDN'T EXACTLY
INVITE ME.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.150
SO HOW DO YOU
KNOW HER?

16:47.150 --> 16:51.860
I WORKED WITH HER
A FEW YEARS AGO.

16:51.860 --> 16:55.240
AND WE KIND OF LIKE--
KIND OF DATED FOR A WHILE.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.250
WELL, WHY YOU AIN'T
JUST TELL ME THAT?

16:59.250 --> 17:03.250
WAS I SUPPOSED TO
INTRODUCE HER AS
MY EX-GIRLFRIEND?

17:03.250 --> 17:05.130
I DON'T KNOW. I FIGURED
I'D TELL YOU LATER,

17:05.130 --> 17:07.050
WHICH IS WHAT I'M
DOING RIGHT NOW.

17:07.050 --> 17:08.670
WELL, YOU DEFINITELY
COULD'VE TOLD ME

17:08.670 --> 17:10.130
YOU WAS GOING TO
MEET UP WITH HER.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.260
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE
WAS IN TOWN.

17:12.260 --> 17:14.220
COME ON. YOU KNEW
SHE'D BE BACK FOR THAT
COTILLION, RIGHT?

17:14.220 --> 17:16.470
WHY WOULD I PUT
THAT TOGETHER?

17:16.470 --> 17:19.100
I'M NOT
NANCY DREW, LIKE.

17:19.100 --> 17:22.020
I DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE
MAKING, LIKE, WAY TOO
MUCH OF A DEAL OF THIS.

17:22.020 --> 17:24.060
IF IT WASN'T A BIG
DEAL, YOU'D HAVE
TOLD ME ABOUT HER

17:24.060 --> 17:25.980
OR TOLD HER ABOUT ME.

17:25.980 --> 17:29.400
OK, COOP, FINE.
MY EX, LUNA, IS IN TOWN,

17:29.400 --> 17:32.820
AND SHE'LL BE
AT THE COTILLION. HAPPY?

17:34.280 --> 17:38.410
♪ I'M CHECKIN' MY FEET,
I'M SPEAKING THE TRUTH... ♪

17:47.170 --> 17:50.210
YOU WORK HERE, TOO?

17:50.210 --> 17:51.920
WHEW. HEY,
TIMES MUST BE ROUGH.

17:51.920 --> 17:54.050
I'VE BEEN THINKING
'BOUT WHAT YOU SAID,

17:54.050 --> 17:55.470
'BOUT YOUR FUTURE.

17:55.470 --> 17:57.720
THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

18:00.140 --> 18:02.060
IT CAN GO ONE OF
TWO WAYS, TY.

18:02.060 --> 18:06.100
YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT
COOP AND MRS. BAKER.

18:06.100 --> 18:08.190
YOU TAKE THE WIN
AND YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE.

18:08.190 --> 18:10.610
WHAT'S THE SECOND,
LITTLE G?

18:10.610 --> 18:15.240
KEEP PUSHING. MAYBE
YOU HURT SOMEBODY,

18:15.240 --> 18:17.450
AND THEN THE WHOLE
HOOD TURNS ON YOU.

18:17.450 --> 18:19.490
I GOT 'EM
TO DO IT ONCE.
I CAN DO IT AGAIN,

18:19.490 --> 18:21.750
ONLY MAYBE IT DON'T
WORK OUT SO GOOD
FOR YOU THIS TIME.

18:21.750 --> 18:25.830
SPENCER JAMES
COMING IN STRONG.

18:25.830 --> 18:27.540
THE DAYS OF YOU
RUNNING AROUND

18:27.540 --> 18:29.920
LIKE SOME LITTLE SUPERHERO
CALLING THE SHOTS

18:29.920 --> 18:31.090
IS GONE.

18:31.090 --> 18:32.920
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

18:34.300 --> 18:36.180
I THINK YOU JEALOUS.

18:36.180 --> 18:38.890
YOU JEALOUS THAT
A 17 YEAR OLD

18:38.890 --> 18:40.430
GETS MORE RESPECT
THAN YOU'LL EVER HAVE

18:40.430 --> 18:42.970
AND I AIN'T HAD TO HURT
NOBODY TO GET IT.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.730
LOOK UP, LITTLE HOMIE.

18:48.730 --> 18:51.320
YOU AIN'T GOT YOUR LITTLE
FOOTBALL HAT ON NO MORE.

18:51.320 --> 18:53.150
DON'T NOBODY GIVE
A DAMN ABOUT YOU.

18:53.150 --> 18:55.700
YOU JUST SOME NEGRO
OUT HERE ON THE STREETS

18:55.700 --> 18:57.990
WITH NOTHING TO OFFER.

18:57.990 --> 18:59.910
IF I AIN'T GOT NOTHING
TO OFFER, THEN I AIN'T
GOT NOTHING TO LOSE.

18:59.910 --> 19:02.330
SO IF YOU DO COME BACK
TO COOP OR MRS. BAKER,

19:02.330 --> 19:05.750
AIN'T NOTHING GONNA STOP
ME FROM COMING FOR
YOUR ASS, YOU HEAR ME?

19:08.960 --> 19:10.710
NOTHING.

19:31.050 --> 19:33.800
PATIENCE: OOH. EVERYONE'S
LOOKING SO GOOD.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.380
BUT NOT AS GOOD
AS YOU, THOUGH.

19:35.380 --> 19:37.300
MM. YOU TOOK THE WORDS
RIGHT OUT OF MY MOUTH.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.140
IF MY MOM WASN'T
HERE, I'D MAKE
A MOVE ON YOU.

19:39.140 --> 19:40.890
STOP.

19:40.890 --> 19:42.680
OK. STAND OVER THERE.
I WANT TO GET A PICTURE.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.690
-OK.
-WHOA, MOM.

19:44.690 --> 19:46.270
YOU TOOK, LIKE,
100 PICTURES SINCE
WE LEFT THE HOUSE.

19:46.270 --> 19:48.060
I SPENT GOOD MONEY
TO BE HERE THIS EVENING.

19:48.060 --> 19:49.940
AND YOU BEST BELIEVE
I'M GONNA GET

19:49.940 --> 19:51.320
EVERYTHING I CAN OUT OF IT.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.690
PICTURE, PLEASE.

19:55.530 --> 19:58.160
YOU DO APPRECIATE WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE, DON'T YOU?

19:58.160 --> 20:01.080
YOUR MOM, THE WOMAN WHO
THREW YOU OUT OF HER HOUSE,

20:01.080 --> 20:04.830
IS NOW PLAYING PAPARAZZI
WITH HER GAY DAUGHTER

20:04.830 --> 20:06.620
AND HER GAY DAUGHTER'S
GIRLFRIEND. OK?

20:06.620 --> 20:08.130
WELL, SINCE YOU PUT
IT LIKE THAT.

20:08.130 --> 20:09.920
SMILE.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.460
SMILE.

20:12.460 --> 20:14.550
LUNA: WELL,
LOOK AT YOU TWO.

20:14.550 --> 20:16.260
-HEY.
-HOW ARE YOU?

20:16.260 --> 20:18.090
-I'M GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
-I'M GOOD.

20:18.090 --> 20:20.890
HEY.

20:20.890 --> 20:22.560
YOU BOTH LOOK
BEAUTIFUL.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.970
MOM: DON'T THEY, THOUGH?
PATIENCE: THANK YOU.

20:23.970 --> 20:25.480
UH, YOU DON'T LOOK
TOO BAD YOURSELF.

20:25.480 --> 20:26.940
LUNA: THANKS, PAY.

20:26.940 --> 20:28.100
WELL, I'LL SEE YOU
INSIDE?

20:28.100 --> 20:29.230
YEAH. I'MA SEE
YOU INSIDE.

20:29.230 --> 20:30.900
ALL RIGHT.

20:30.900 --> 20:33.860
PAY, THAT'S JUST LAZY.

20:33.860 --> 20:35.360
LET IT GO.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.280
"YOU DON'T LOOK
SO BAD YOURSELF."

20:37.280 --> 20:38.700
MAYBE YOU TWO SHOULD
TAKE A PICTURE TOGETHER.

20:38.700 --> 20:41.200
I WAS BEING POLITE. WHAT
AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

20:41.200 --> 20:42.870
UH, NOTHING.

20:42.870 --> 20:44.700
THAT'S WHAT I SAID IN
CASE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE.

20:45.910 --> 20:47.120
YEAH, I NOTICED.

20:49.120 --> 20:53.340
BILLY: HUH. WHEN
I GIVE MY CAPTAINS
THE KEY TO THE GYM,

20:53.340 --> 20:54.760
IT'S NOT SO THAT
THEY CAN LIVE HERE.

20:54.760 --> 20:56.970
-HEY, COACH.
-WHAT'S HAPPENING?

20:56.970 --> 20:59.180
SHOULDN'T YOU BE AT
THE COTILLION?

20:59.180 --> 21:02.930
YEAH. I WAS ON MY WAY,
BUT THEN I SAW YOUR CAR.

21:02.930 --> 21:04.890
I THOUGHT I'D GET
ANOTHER WORKOUT IN.

21:04.890 --> 21:06.930
YOU'VE BEEN HITTING IT
PRETTY HARD LATELY, HUH?

21:06.930 --> 21:09.310
WHATEVER IT TAKES,
RIGHT?

21:09.310 --> 21:11.520
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I USED TO THINK SO.

21:11.520 --> 21:18.200
UH, WHEN I PLAYED,
FOOTBALL WAS WHAT
ALWAYS CAME FIRST.

21:18.200 --> 21:22.620
EVERYTHING ELSE WAS
A DISTANT SECOND,
INCLUDING MY FAMILY.

21:22.620 --> 21:24.620
AND THAT WAS
A BIG MISTAKE.

21:24.620 --> 21:26.500
WELL, I DON'T HAVE
MUCH FAMILY THESE DAYS,

21:26.500 --> 21:30.170
SO I DOUBT THEY'LL NOTICE.

21:30.170 --> 21:33.130
WELL, I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY, ASH.

21:33.130 --> 21:35.300
OLIVIA IS MY DAUGHTER.

21:35.300 --> 21:39.590
THAT'S MY BABY GIRL,
AND TONIGHT'S VERY
IMPORTANT TO HER.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.550
SHE TOLD ME NOT
TO COME, COACH.

21:44.260 --> 21:47.020
LOOK,
YOU'RE YOUR OWN MAN.

21:47.020 --> 21:49.230
YOU CAN MAKE YOUR
OWN CHOICES,

21:49.230 --> 21:52.940
BUT I WOULD THINK LONG
AND HARD BEFORE YOU DO.

21:52.940 --> 21:54.570
YES, SIR.

21:54.570 --> 21:57.780
OK. LOCK UP
BEFORE YOU LEAVE.

22:13.580 --> 22:16.880
I'M PRETTY SURE
THE COTILLION ISN'T
GONNA COME TO YOU.

22:16.880 --> 22:20.420
WELL, HAVING A LITTLE BIT
OF TROUBLE GOING IN THERE.

22:20.420 --> 22:22.380
WELL, MAYBE I CAN HELP.

22:22.380 --> 22:24.390
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE ESCORTING
SOMEONE TONIGHT?

22:24.390 --> 22:28.560
YEAH. YOU...
TO YOUR TABLE.

22:30.390 --> 22:32.390
COME ON.

22:33.900 --> 22:35.480
WE GOT TO HURRY, THOUGH.
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

22:35.480 --> 22:36.860
OK. HA HA.

22:39.860 --> 22:42.820
THANKS FOR BEING
MY ESCORT.

22:42.820 --> 22:45.030
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH ASHER.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.490
HE'S UNDER A LOT OF
PRESSURE.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.410
YEAH, PRESSURE HE
PUTS ON HIMSELF.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.700
HEY, THAT'S THE WORST KIND.
YOU SHOULD GO EASY ON HIM.

22:50.700 --> 22:53.080
I ALWAYS DO. BUT
TONIGHT'S A REALLY
BIG DEAL FOR ME,

22:53.080 --> 22:54.630
AND I JUST FEEL LIKE
HE DOESN'T EVEN CARE.

22:54.630 --> 22:56.630
DID YOU TELL HIM THAT?

22:56.630 --> 22:58.500
'CAUSE ALL I'VE HEARD
OUT YOUR MOUTH IS HOW
IT AIN'T A BIG DEAL.

22:58.500 --> 22:59.880
HE SHOULD KNOW BETTER.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.630
NOT ALL GUYS
CAN READ MINDS, LIV.

23:01.630 --> 23:04.180
-YOU CAN.
-YEAH, BUT I'M SPECIAL.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.810
DID I REALLY GIVE UP MY DATE
FOR YOUR BROTHER?

23:08.810 --> 23:11.430
IF HE DOESN'T SHOW,
I'M TAKING SPENCER BACK.

23:11.430 --> 23:13.520
SPECIAL.

23:13.520 --> 23:15.810
HE WAS IN HIS ROOM
ALL NIGHT TRYING TO
LEARN THE DANCE.

23:15.810 --> 23:17.400
HE WOULDN'T DO THAT
FOR NOTHING.

23:17.400 --> 23:20.360
HE'LL BE HERE.
I PROMISE.

23:20.360 --> 23:23.490
LORETTA: GOOD EVENING,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

24:09.530 --> 24:12.790
I CAN EITHER SMILE OR
I CAN BREATHE, NOT BOTH.

24:12.790 --> 24:15.750
YOU CAN EITHER LIVE LOOKING
MISERABLE OR DIE SMILING.

24:15.750 --> 24:17.670

26:27.840 --> 26:29.210
YOU LOOK GREAT.

26:29.210 --> 26:30.720
ALL I WAS SAYING IS,

26:30.720 --> 26:32.800
IF YOU HAD BEEN STRAIGHT
WITH ME FROM THE JUMP,

26:32.800 --> 26:35.430
ALL OF THIS WOULD'VE
BEEN SQUASHED.

HEY. MIND IF I JOIN YOU?

26:39.060 --> 26:40.680

READ THE TABLE.

26:43.270 --> 26:45.060
OH, I'M--I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS
INTERRUPTING ANYTHING.

26:45.060 --> 26:47.440
NO, NO, NO. YOU AREN'T.

27:08.670 --> 27:11.260
OLIVIA: LOOKS LIKE
SPENCER STOLE YOUR DATE.

27:11.260 --> 27:14.510
ALL THAT DANCING ALONE
IN YOUR ROOM FOR NOTHING.

27:14.510 --> 27:16.090
OH, I'M GONNA KILL
OLIVIA.

ROYALLY SCREW IT UP

27:28.730 --> 27:31.190

27:31.190 --> 27:34.150
LAYLA, YOU'RE TALKING
TO THE KING OF SCREW-UPS.

27:34.150 --> 27:37.120

IS TRY TO BE BETTER
MOVING FORWARD.

EVERY LITTLE DETAIL
OF THEIR LIVES

28:54.650 --> 28:57.280
LIKE IT'S
BREAKING NEWS.

28:57.280 --> 28:59.160
ACTUALLY, LIV, IT'S COOL.

28:59.160 --> 29:01.370
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH OF LUNA

29:23.310 --> 29:25.770
YOU LOOKED GOOD
OUT THERE.

29:25.770 --> 29:28.520
HUH. ONLY 'CAUSE
THE PRETTIEST GIRL IN THE
ROOM WAS DANCING WITH ME.

29:30.850 --> 29:33.270
I HAVEN'T HAD THE CHANCE
TO THANK YOU.

29:33.270 --> 29:35.280
COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN EASY TELLING
YOUR GIRLFRIEND

29:35.280 --> 29:37.240
SHE'S A CRAY-CRAY.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.200
NAH, YOU WAS JUST IN PAIN.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.870
WHEN SOMEBODY YOU
LOVE IS HURTING,

29:41.870 --> 29:43.240
YOU DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES TO HELP, RIGHT?

29:43.240 --> 29:45.410
WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT
TO DO IT.

29:45.410 --> 29:48.290
AND, YOU KNOW, I'M
SORRY FOR HOW I REACTED.

29:48.290 --> 29:50.080
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN EASY
BEING TOLD YOU WERE

29:50.080 --> 29:51.670
CRAY-CRAY.

29:52.920 --> 29:54.710
YOUR WORDS, NOT MINE.

29:58.760 --> 30:00.720
I MISSED THAT LAUGH.

30:00.720 --> 30:03.430
I MISSED YOU.

30:16.570 --> 30:20.860
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY. I--

30:20.860 --> 30:23.320
OH, MY GOD. UM...

30:23.320 --> 30:26.580
SORRY.
I MUST'VE MISREAD
THE SITUATION IF--

30:26.580 --> 30:28.750
YOU DIDN'T MISREAD
NOTHING, ALL RIGHT?
I WANT TO KISS YOU.

30:28.750 --> 30:30.710
I WANT TO BE
WITH YOU. I DO.

30:30.710 --> 30:33.380
SO WHAT AM I MISSING?

30:33.380 --> 30:36.290
I READ THAT YOU SHOULDN'T
JUMP BACK INTO RELATIONSHIPS

30:36.290 --> 30:37.880
DURING EARLY STAGES
OF RECOVERY, SO...

30:37.880 --> 30:40.050
YOU READ ABOUT IT?

30:40.050 --> 30:41.880
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE I SAID.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.720
WHEN SOMEBODY YOU LOVE
IS HURTING,

30:43.720 --> 30:45.140
YOU DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

30:45.140 --> 30:46.810
HEY, LOOK, IF YOU CAN
HONESTLY SAY THAT

30:46.810 --> 30:48.850

TO MAKE THIS WORK,

30:48.850 --> 30:50.730
THEN I'M ALL IN.

30:50.730 --> 30:53.810
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO MESS THINGS UP
BY RUSHING IT.

30:56.110 --> 31:00.570
THEY DID SAY I SHOULD
FOCUS ON MYSELF
DURING RECOVERY.

31:00.570 --> 31:02.990
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW
LONG THAT'S GONNA BE.

31:02.990 --> 31:04.700
HOW EVER LONG IT IS,
I'LL WAIT.

31:04.700 --> 31:06.910
SPENCER, YOU
DON'T KNOW THAT.

31:06.910 --> 31:08.620
YOU KNOW, WHAT IF
OUR TIMING NEVER
SYNCS UP AGAIN?

31:08.620 --> 31:10.910
HEY, LAYLA,

31:10.910 --> 31:13.210
I'M NOT GOING NOWHERE.

31:13.210 --> 31:14.710
I'LL WAIT.

31:20.760 --> 31:21.920
PATIENCE.

31:24.220 --> 31:26.340
NO WONDER YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO TAKE
A PICTURE WITH LUNA.

31:26.340 --> 31:28.850
YOU GOT A THOUSAND.

31:28.850 --> 31:31.930
SO NOW YOU'RE
STALKING HER?

31:31.930 --> 31:34.020
I DON'T HAVE CONTROL
OVER LUNA'S INSTAGRAM.

31:34.020 --> 31:36.310
MAYBE NOT, BUT YOU SURE
AS HELL HAVE CONTROL
OVER YOUR OWN LIES.

31:36.310 --> 31:37.900
WHAT DID I LIE ABOUT?

31:37.900 --> 31:39.940
WELL, FIRST YOU SAID SHE
WAS JUST AN OLD FRIEND.

31:39.940 --> 31:43.320
THEN YOU SAID SHE
WAS JUST SOME EX, BUT SHE'S
NOT JUST SOME EX.

31:43.320 --> 31:46.950
SHE'S THE EX, YOUR
FIRST, THE ONE WHO
USED TO PAINT YOU.

31:46.950 --> 31:50.240
"I CALL THIS ONE
'PAY IN A TOWEL.'"

31:50.240 --> 31:53.200
"I CALL THIS ONE
'PAY WITHOUT
A TOWEL.'"

31:53.200 --> 31:55.040
MAYBE LUNA JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DRAW CLOTHES.

31:55.040 --> 31:57.460
YOU KNOW WHAT I CALL
THIS RIGHT NOW?

31:57.460 --> 31:59.540
A GIRL WHO'S LOSING
HER DAMN MIND
FOR NO REASON.

31:59.540 --> 32:01.960
FOR NO REASON?
SHE'S THE GIRL WHO
HELPED YOU COME OUT

32:01.960 --> 32:03.340
JUST LIKE YOU DID ME.

32:03.340 --> 32:04.970
HOW COULD YOU NOT
TELL ME THAT WAS LUNA?

32:04.970 --> 32:06.680
'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
YOU ACTING CRAZY,

32:06.680 --> 32:08.970
LIKE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW,
BY THE WAY.

32:08.970 --> 32:11.470
WHEN DID YOU STOP
TRUSTING ME?

32:13.180 --> 32:14.850
RIGHT AFTER YOU
STARTED LYING TO ME.

32:14.850 --> 32:18.860
OK. AND WHO STARTED
LYING FIRST?

32:18.860 --> 32:21.820
SO YOU PUNISHING ME
FOR THE J.P. MISTAKE?

32:21.820 --> 32:24.360
I KNEW YOU WERE STILL MAD.

32:24.360 --> 32:26.400
I CAN'T DO THIS.

32:26.400 --> 32:28.160
LIKE, YOU FREAKED OUT

32:28.160 --> 32:29.870
BECAUSE J.P. WAS MORE
INTERESTED IN ME

32:29.870 --> 32:31.700
AS AN ARTIST THAN
HE WAS IN YOU.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.620
AND NOW YOU'RE
FREAKING OUT

32:33.620 --> 32:35.960
BECAUSE I'M STILL
FRIENDS WITH
MY EX-GIRLFRIEND?

32:35.960 --> 32:38.920
I'M FREAKING OUT
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.300
I KNOW.

32:44.300 --> 32:47.840
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO BE LOVED LIKE THIS.

32:49.510 --> 32:51.970
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE SUFFOCATING ME.

32:51.970 --> 32:55.680
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD
JUST TAKE SOME TIME APART.

32:55.680 --> 32:59.480
I THINK WE
CAN USE A BREAK.

33:02.070 --> 33:03.530
PRETTY CONVENIENT TIME
TO TAKE A BREAK

33:03.530 --> 33:04.900
WITH LUNA IN TOWN.

33:09.450 --> 33:10.910
GOOD-BYE, TAMIA.

33:26.250 --> 33:28.170
OK, MAYBE WE SHOULD
STOP THE CREEPING.

33:28.170 --> 33:29.630
YOU SAW HOW THAT
WORKED OUT FOR COOP.

33:29.630 --> 33:31.290
YEAH, WELL. IT'S--
IT'S MATT SPRINGER.

33:31.290 --> 33:33.960
GOD. I'M REALLY STARTING
TO HATE THIS GUY.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.130
ME, TOO.

33:35.130 --> 33:37.260
HEY, DAD.

33:37.260 --> 33:39.890
LORETTA: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
EVERY YEAR WE PRESENT

33:39.890 --> 33:43.970
AN AWARD FOR OUR MOST PROMISING
COTILLIONAIRE.

33:43.970 --> 33:49.730
NOT ONLY HAS THIS YOUNG LADY
VOLUNTEERED OVER 100 HOURS,

33:49.730 --> 33:52.520
SHE ALSO STARTED A PODCAST TO
BRING ATTENTION

33:52.520 --> 33:54.320
TO SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES,

33:54.320 --> 33:57.150
AND DOING THIS
WHILE ATTENDING HIGH SCHOOL.

33:57.150 --> 34:00.910
OLIVIA BAKER, WOULD
YOU COME UP HERE, PLEASE?

34:09.750 --> 34:12.210
AT LEAST WE
DID SOMETHING RIGHT.

34:12.210 --> 34:15.130
WELL, SHE TAKES
AFTER HER MOTHER.

34:15.130 --> 34:17.010
THANK YOU.

34:24.180 --> 34:26.390
IT'LL BE NICE TO HAVE AN AWARD
IN OUR HOUSE THAT

34:26.390 --> 34:29.520
ISN'T A FOOTBALL TROPHY
OR A SOBRIETY CHIP.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.400
WHEN I FIRST JOINED
SoLA MUSE,

34:37.400 --> 34:39.610
I WAS LOST.

34:39.610 --> 34:43.320
I THOUGHT IT WAS A CLUB FOR
WOMEN WHO LIKED TO WEAR WHITE

34:43.320 --> 34:45.530
AND DO BRUNCH.

34:45.530 --> 34:49.830
BUT MY BRILLIANT MOTHER
TOLD ME TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE.

34:49.830 --> 34:53.500
AND I'M SO HAPPY THAT SHE DID
BECAUSE I SOON REALIZED THAT

34:53.500 --> 34:55.790
THESE WERE WOMEN OF SUBSTANCE,

34:55.790 --> 34:58.300
WOMEN OF ACTION.

34:58.300 --> 35:02.550
THEY INSPIRED ME AND HELPED ME
FIND MY PURPOSE.

35:02.550 --> 35:05.390
AND I COULDN'T BE PROUDER TO BE
ONE OF THEM.

35:08.140 --> 35:12.190
AND, LUCKILY, I ALSO LIKE
WEARING WHITE AND DOING BRUNCH.

35:15.230 --> 35:16.360
THANK YOU.

35:21.360 --> 35:22.860
BILLY: SO GOOD. SO GOOD.

35:22.860 --> 35:25.950
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

35:25.950 --> 35:27.080
BEAUTIFUL, HONEY.

35:27.080 --> 35:28.200
THANKS, MOM.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.240
SO PROUD.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.330
-THANKS, DAD.
-SO PROUD.

35:32.330 --> 35:33.460
ALL RIGHT.

35:33.460 --> 35:35.250
HA HA!

35:36.880 --> 35:38.210
NOT BAD, KID.

35:44.050 --> 35:46.390
-CONGRATULATIONS.
-THANKS.

35:57.190 --> 36:00.440
CONGRATULATIONS, I GUESS.

36:00.440 --> 36:02.110
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOU
WERE GETTING AN AWARD.

36:02.110 --> 36:04.240
I DIDN'T KNOW.

36:04.240 --> 36:06.660
WELL, I CAME TO APOLOGIZE
TO MY GIRLFRIEND,

36:06.660 --> 36:09.280
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE,
UH, YOU'RE DOING
JUST FINE WITHOUT ME.

36:09.280 --> 36:13.120
I WANTED YOU HERE,
BUT YOU MADE YOUR
PRIORITIES CRYSTAL CLEAR.

36:13.120 --> 36:15.330
FOOTBALL IS ALL
THAT I HAVE, LIV.

36:15.330 --> 36:17.210
I DON'T GET TO PICK
AND CHOOSE

36:17.210 --> 36:19.460
AND GET AN AWARD
FOR WHATEVER I
WANT, ALL RIGHT?

36:19.460 --> 36:20.800
WHAT THE HELL'S
WRONG WITH YOU?

36:20.800 --> 36:22.340
BILLY: EASY.

36:22.340 --> 36:24.050
I THINK YOU SHOULD--
YOU SHOULD LEAVE, ASH.

36:26.340 --> 36:27.800
FINE.

36:31.890 --> 36:34.230
-YOU ALL RIGHT?
-YEAH.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.110
WAIT. DAD, HEY, HEY.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

36:40.110 --> 36:41.690
LET HIM--LET HIM
COOL OFF, OK?

36:41.690 --> 36:43.900
ASHER'S THE LEAST OF
YOUR PROBLEMS.

36:43.900 --> 36:46.070
I THINK MATT SPRINGER'S
TRYING TO TAKE YOUR JOB.

36:46.070 --> 36:48.320
SAY WHAT?

36:48.320 --> 36:51.080
READ THE COMMENTS.

36:51.080 --> 36:52.870
"LEMON TREE LOOKS GREAT."

36:52.870 --> 36:54.370
NO. BELOW THAT.

36:54.370 --> 36:55.540
"GOOD LUCK, COACH.

36:55.540 --> 36:57.460
THEY'D BE LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU..."

36:57.460 --> 36:59.080
"AT BEVERLY."

36:59.080 --> 37:00.920
THIS IS JUST FANS
GUESSING, RIGHT?

37:00.920 --> 37:03.050
MAYBE, BUT HE SAID
SOME STUFF AT PRACTICE

37:03.050 --> 37:04.710
THAT MADE IT SEEM LIKE
HE WAS STICKING AROUND
NEXT SEASON.

37:04.710 --> 37:06.430
HUH.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.140
WELL, THANKS
FOR TELLING ME, SON.

37:11.140 --> 37:12.510
YEAH.

37:12.510 --> 37:15.270
A FEW WEEKS AGO, YOU
WOULD'VE LOOKED FORWARD

37:15.270 --> 37:19.100
TO ME BEING REPLACED BY
YOUR FAVORITE HEISMAN
TROPHY-WINNING QB.

37:19.100 --> 37:21.770
NAH. I'M TEAM BAKER
ALL THE WAY.

37:21.770 --> 37:24.320
I EVEN GOT THE NAME
ON THE BACK
OF MY JERSEY.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.280
-MY MAN.
-ALL RIGHT.

37:29.530 --> 37:31.530
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
WALK ME OUT.

37:31.530 --> 37:33.700
FLIP: YEAH. IT
SHOULD'VE BEEN THAT
JORDAN KID. HA HA.

37:33.700 --> 37:36.370
HE JUST HAD A BIT OF
A FAMILY EMERGENCY.

37:36.370 --> 37:38.000
OH. HMM.

37:39.880 --> 37:43.130
HEY, UH, MY BAD

37:43.130 --> 37:45.550

AND I MADE IT CLEAR TO
TYRONE WHAT WILL HAPPEN
IF HE TOUCH COOP,

37:47.800 --> 37:50.180
SO, HOPEFULLY,
HE'LL JUST MOVE ON.

37:50.180 --> 37:52.390
DUDES LIKE TYRONE,
THEY JUST DON'T MOVE ON.

37:52.390 --> 37:54.430
THEY FEEL BY HATE.

37:54.430 --> 37:56.680
ALL THEY WANT TO DO
IS HURT SOMEBODY.

37:56.680 --> 37:59.520
IF IT'S NOT
COOP, TRUST ME,

37:59.520 --> 38:01.270
IT'S GONNA BE
SOMEONE ELSE.

38:06.820 --> 38:09.150
ANYBODY

38:09.150 --> 38:10.780
NAH, YOU GOOD.

OR WHAT?

38:20.580 --> 38:22.380
THAT'S THE PLAN.

38:22.380 --> 38:24.210
FROM WHAT I HEARD,
YOU JUST THE MAN
TO DO IT.

38:24.210 --> 38:26.170
JUST MAKE SURE
YOU DON'T GET HURT.

38:41.390 --> 38:43.150
HEY, WHERE YOU BEEN, BABY?

38:47.570 --> 38:49.740
NO, I HAVE NOT.

38:49.740 --> 38:53.610
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
WITH YOU AND PATIENCE?

38:53.610 --> 38:58.370
I CAN TELL WHEN MY
DAUGHTER'S UNHAPPY.

38:58.370 --> 39:00.580
I MESSED UP.

39:00.580 --> 39:02.750
IT'S LIKE I HAVEN'T
BEEN ACTING LIKE
MYSELF LATELY.

39:02.750 --> 39:08.050
I WAS INSECURE,
PARANOID, AND JEALOUS.

39:08.050 --> 39:10.840
LIKE, I DON'T
BLAME PATIENCE FOR NOT
WANTING TO BE WITH ME.

39:10.840 --> 39:13.260
I WOULD NOT WANT
TO BE WITH ME EITHER.

39:13.260 --> 39:16.220
HEY.

39:16.220 --> 39:19.520
THAT'S MY DAUGHTER
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

39:19.520 --> 39:24.190
AND TAMIA IS KIND,
THOUGHTFUL, SMART,

39:24.190 --> 39:26.310

39:26.310 --> 39:28.520
AND I'M NOT GONNA LET
ANYBODY TALK ABOUT
HER LIKE THAT,

39:28.520 --> 39:31.400
NOT EVEN YOU.

39:31.400 --> 39:33.610
EVERYBODY MAKES
MISTAKES, BABY.

39:33.610 --> 39:36.200
YOU'RE GONNA WORK IT OUT
WITH PATIENCE.

39:55.890 --> 39:58.430
I GUESS YOU DO
HAVE IT COVERED.

39:58.430 --> 40:00.350

IT'S WHERE WE FEEL LOVED.

40:14.610 --> 40:18.570
