SYLVIA: Wander, the whole galaxy is gonna
get pulled into this black

00:37.246 --> 00:40.707
hole if we don't find a way to plug
this sucker up!

00:40.791 --> 00:43.752
We'll find the perfect portal plug

00:43.836 --> 00:46.713
don't you worry, Sylvia!

00:46.880 --> 00:49.049
Wander!

00:53.220 --> 00:55.681
I'll be grop darned. You did it, buddy!

00:55.764 --> 00:57.808
Perfect portal plug procured.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.529
So, uh, now what?

01:10.612 --> 01:13.282
You're just going to stand there? Forever?

01:13.365 --> 01:18.495
Nah, I'm positive my hat can produce a
permanent patch for this pesky puncture.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.597
So, uh... Yeah.

01:36.847 --> 01:39.600
Looks like I'll be standing here, forever.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.059
Don't worry, buddy.

01:41.185 --> 01:43.604
I will scour the galaxy for
the perfect plug

01:43.687 --> 01:47.024
no matter what terrifying dangers I must
face, and amazing feats

01:47.149 --> 01:51.445
-I must accomplish, I will find a way!
-yeah! Let's go!

01:52.654 --> 01:54.114
Oh, right.

01:54.198 --> 01:55.407
I'll be back.

01:55.490 --> 01:56.491
No rush, Syl.

01:56.575 --> 02:00.120
There's plenty of ways to while away the
time 'till you get back.

02:28.899 --> 02:32.236
Just... Wanna... Sit!

02:37.950 --> 02:39.868

05:11.353 --> 05:13.146
Am I glad to see you!

You see, this little black hole is
threatening to destroy the entire galaxy

05:16.608 --> 05:19.236
while Sylvia went off to find
something to plug it up permanently

05:19.319 --> 05:20.779
I've been stuck here all day.

05:20.863 --> 05:23.115
At first I didn't think
it would be a problem,

05:23.198 --> 05:26.994
but I tell you, friend, it's been a battle
with the burden of boredom, and I

05:27.077 --> 05:29.872
don't know if I can take this anymore!

05:30.789 --> 05:36.044
-Any way you can help a buddy out?
-You? Need my help?

05:39.506 --> 05:41.925
This is a very interesting situation

05:42.009 --> 05:44.845
One doesn't get in a situation
like this every day.

05:45.095 --> 05:48.390
-Tell me about it
-I mean, you can't even do this.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.309
Look at me, two hands!

06:03.739 --> 06:05.157
Thanks. I love apples.

06:07.743 --> 06:11.038
LORD HATER: Gah! I hate apples!
WANDER: Aw man! Oh well

06:11.121 --> 06:13.207
Hey, since you're a friend, indeed.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.542
How's about helping your friend, in need?

06:15.667 --> 06:19.630
Like maybe zip-zappin' the hole shut with
some of your cosmic lightning bolt?

06:19.713 --> 06:20.923
What's the rush?

06:21.006 --> 06:26.011
You said you were bored. Let's have
some fun... friend.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.181
LORD HATER (SINGING): When you wander

06:29.264 --> 06:30.933
Over yonder

06:31.642 --> 06:34.561
And you wear a stupid hat

06:34.645 --> 06:36.313
Tag, you're it!

(MOCKINGLY): Wander!

06:45.697 --> 06:47.533
Oh, that was very rude.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.034
What did you have for lunch?

06:49.117 --> 06:50.827
Oh, right, sorry. You're starving.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.121
Okay, this may be fun for you, but

06:53.330 --> 06:56.583
-This may be fun for you but
-Okay, I get it

06:56.667 --> 06:58.085
Okay, I get it.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.003
Lord Hater, I thought you came here-

07:00.087 --> 07:03.048
(MOCKINGLY): Lord Hater,
I thought you came here-

07:03.215 --> 07:06.218
-to help.
-To help.

07:06.301 --> 07:07.344
Sorry. Sorry.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.847
Let me see what I can do.

07:10.055 --> 07:13.517
It's ringing. Hello, Sylvia?

07:13.725 --> 07:16.061
Yes, this is Lord Hater.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.396
Yeah, I know.

07:17.479 --> 07:18.981
Funny hearing from me.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.900
Is she okay? Has she found something
to plug up the hole?

07:22.025 --> 07:24.486
Yeah, so I'm here trying to help Wander.

07:24.570 --> 07:28.407
And I was wondering if you... Mm-hmm. Yeah

07:28.490 --> 07:29.992
(LAUGHS): Oh, grop

07:30.158 --> 07:31.743
Yeah. Tell me about it.

07:31.827 --> 07:33.328
What?

07:33.412 --> 07:35.205
Oh, sure.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.249
Uhuh, all right.

07:37.374 --> 07:41.920
LORD HATER: I'll tell him. You too, you
flab-dresser! Mm-hmm. Bye.

07:43.213 --> 07:46.175
She says you have a dumb face,
and she doesn't like you

07:46.258 --> 07:50.345
and she never liked you, and she's never
coming back because your face is so dumb!

07:50.429 --> 07:53.891
What's the matter? The power of friendship
didn't save you?

07:59.521 --> 08:03.442
Oh, man, that was... that was really mean,
wasn't it?

08:03.734 --> 08:05.485
Have I always been that mean?

08:05.819 --> 08:10.532
I'm finally seeing the error of my ways.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.201
-Really?
-Yeah

08:12.326 --> 08:14.244
LORD HATER: You really need my help.

08:14.453 --> 08:16.538
Here I am being an insensitive jerk.

08:17.956 --> 08:21.668
I'd probably feel a lot better if someone
just hugged me right now.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.671
Gosh, if I even got the littlest hug,

08:24.796 --> 08:28.509
LORD HATER: I would totally reform and not
be evil anymore.

08:28.759 --> 08:31.970
Hater, I'm right here for you, buddy

08:32.054 --> 08:34.806
Too bad there's no one here
to make me feel better.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.683
Yo, right here!

08:36.850 --> 08:39.811
A one-armed hug still comes
with a wide open heart.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.813
Well, no takers.

08:41.897 --> 08:44.816
Guess I'll just stay evil. Ha!

08:44.900 --> 08:46.026
You're finished.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.862
Useless! Bye bye good guy!

08:48.946 --> 08:51.907
You can't even wander any more

08:52.032 --> 08:55.702
You're more like... Stander! Over there!

08:58.080 --> 09:01.875
You know what you are? You're
just a whole lotta nothing!

09:02.209 --> 09:05.546
Never hurts to help! Ha!

09:06.296 --> 09:10.509
If I can't even give a friend a hug,
then what good am I at all?

09:11.510 --> 09:14.680
LORD HATER: Never hurts to help.
Never hurts to help.

09:14.847 --> 09:17.182
Never hurts to help.

09:17.266 --> 09:18.642
LORD HATER: Wait, what now?

09:18.725 --> 09:21.645
I was, selfishly thinking about
how I was suffering

09:21.728 --> 09:24.690
totally forgetting about
all the folks I'm helping

09:24.773 --> 09:28.193
by not letting the galaxy get sucked
into this black hole

09:28.443 --> 09:30.445
And shucks. I'm even helping you!

09:30.529 --> 09:31.822
Wait. What?

09:31.905 --> 09:34.241
-No!
-Never hurts to help

09:34.324 --> 09:35.784
Thanks for reminding me, pal.

09:35.868 --> 09:37.494
That was just the help I needed.

09:39.329 --> 09:42.541
Don't you dare find a positive
in this terrible, horrible thing.

09:46.003 --> 09:48.338
Who's helping now?

09:58.557 --> 09:59.808
Oh no

10:00.976 --> 10:02.311
Wow! Lord Hater.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.188
You're saving the galaxy too!

10:04.271 --> 10:08.984
-I knew there was good in you way,
-No, no, no, no

10:09.067 --> 10:12.863
But don't worry, you kept me company
in my darkest hour

10:12.946 --> 10:18.368
and I'll happily do the same for you.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.721
Stupid Peepers, stupid horse.

15:29.805 --> 15:32.224
I'm the greatest, you're the worst!

15:37.604 --> 15:41.358
Who's not gonna stop rockin'
till love comes a-knockin'?

15:41.525 --> 15:43.986
Ha!

16:11.722 --> 16:15.350
Who is the universe's awesomest evil-doer?

16:15.434 --> 16:19.104
Hater!

16:29.031 --> 16:32.075
We have been Lord Hater
and the Harbingers of Doom

16:32.159 --> 16:34.912
and before we go, we have one
more thing to say to you.

16:38.081 --> 16:39.791
WANDER: One, two, three, four!

16:39.875 --> 16:44.755
LORD HATER (SINGING): Who is the universe
awesomest evil-doer? Hater!

16:45.839 --> 16:48.926
But how? I'm exhausted.

16:49.301 --> 16:51.011
How are they still going?

16:53.639 --> 16:54.973
(BOTH LAUGH)

16:58.727 --> 17:01.480
Whoo! One more time!

17:03.941 --> 17:09.071
(SINGING): Who is the universe
awesomest evil-doer? Hater!

17:09.196 --> 17:10.739
Faster!

17:11.031 --> 17:14.159
Who is the universe's
awesomest evil-doer? Hater!

17:14.243 --> 17:15.827
Faster

17:15.911 --> 17:18.330
Who is the universe awesomest
evil-doer? Hater!

17:18.413 --> 17:20.332
En Español!

17:24.253 --> 17:29.049
Quien es el mas awesomest malhechor
del universo? Hater!

17:30.717 --> 17:32.845
Now backwards.

17:34.137 --> 17:38.809
(SINGING BACKWARDS)

17:38.892 --> 17:41.728
Faster! faster!

17:41.812 --> 17:43.981
Who is the- Who is the-

17:48.652 --> 17:55.450
We have been Lord Harry and
the Happy Burgers of Boom

17:57.244 --> 17:59.246
(ALL CHEERING)

18:03.208 --> 18:05.752
Hater, you can't stop now.

18:05.836 --> 18:07.087
Dominators not

18:11.133 --> 18:12.426
here.

18:29.443 --> 18:32.112
PEEPERS: We're doomed! I knew
this was a stupid plan!

18:36.992 --> 18:38.702
But I gotta help him, Syl.

18:38.869 --> 18:41.496
He's finally choosing love over hate

18:48.879 --> 18:51.965
Who is...

18:52.049 --> 18:53.926
Universe's

18:59.765 --> 19:01.600
Wander!

19:01.725 --> 19:05.896
Hater may be out of his mind, but
at least his heart's in the right place.

19:21.912 --> 19:25.165
WANDER (SINGING AS HATER): one, two,
three, four.

19:25.249 --> 19:28.877
Who is the universe's awesomest evil-doer?

19:29.002 --> 19:32.130
Hater! Alright!

19:32.464 --> 19:34.883
PEEPERS: He's out of his mind.

19:34.967 --> 19:37.469
But at least his heart's
in the right place

19:38.136 --> 19:39.263
Come on.

19:40.931 --> 19:42.933
PEEPERS: Oh no, this is ridiculous.

19:43.058 --> 19:44.935
Well, I'll be blasted to smithereens.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.187
Or maybe it'll work, either way.

19:47.271 --> 19:49.189
It will be a heck of a show stopper.

19:50.524 --> 19:52.776
(PEEPERS PLAYS DRUMS)

19:59.241 --> 20:05.080
Who's super strong and shoots
out scary green lighting? Hater!

20:06.290 --> 20:11.753
Who set the record for galactic
explosions, Hater!

20:13.297 --> 20:14.715
She stopped firing!

20:14.798 --> 20:16.425
It's working?

20:16.508 --> 20:22.556
Who's really happy that his friends
will support him? Hater!

20:22.931 --> 20:28.854
Who's make and found love and is on
the path to be a good guy? Hater!

20:29.229 --> 20:33.233
Who tries to conquer and rule just
'cause he wants to be cool?

20:33.317 --> 20:37.613
Who pushes and shoves just 'cause
he wants to be loved?

20:37.696 --> 20:40.782
Who likes a lady villain, wants
to show her he's willin'?

20:40.866 --> 20:46.496
Who's is insecure and lonely? Your
sensitive puppy-lovin' one and only

20:58.842 --> 20:59.968
It worked.

21:01.053 --> 21:03.347
Who can't believe,

21:03.430 --> 21:05.933
How amazingly stupid this is.

21:06.058 --> 21:07.809
Dominator!

21:14.191 --> 21:17.152
(SYLVIA AND PEEPERS TOGETHER): That
totally didn't work.

21:17.444 --> 21:20.989
Did you see? She was, like, so into it.

21:21.198 --> 21:23.867
Next time, we need three,
no, six drummers!

21:25.661 --> 21:27.162
SYLVIA: No!
PEEPERS: No!
