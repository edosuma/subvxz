Brother meeting.

00:48.047 --> 00:51.760
Our temporary roommate situation
is at crisis level.

00:51.926 --> 00:53.553
There's been enough bloodshed.

00:54.971 --> 00:57.515
Sorry about that, Templeton.
I got a little carried away.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.019
-Our sacred brothership is strong.
-Rock solid.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.937
And I think if we come up
with ground rules,

01:03.021 --> 01:04.314
things can go even better.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.858
I concur. A contract.

01:08.902 --> 01:12.947
Rule number one:
When I work, I need a quiet, calm space.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.491
A mouse fart should be alarming.

01:14.824 --> 01:18.953
Second rule number one:
Don't touch my stuff.

01:19.037 --> 01:23.208
That's actually the only one I need,
but it would be in really big letters.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.667
We're agreed on terms.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.128
So, how will these rules be enforced?

01:27.337 --> 01:29.047
We'll figure that out as we go.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.801
[baby monitor chiming]

01:34.385 --> 01:36.262
-Gah! Templeton, what--?
-Spit wad.

01:36.346 --> 01:39.182
I believe there was a rule
about touching my stuff.

01:39.933 --> 01:43.478
So I said,
"Is this Acquisitions, or is it..."

01:43.561 --> 01:45.480

01:45.563 --> 01:47.732

-Ow! Templeton.
-Shh.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.487
Quiet work space.
[whispers] Mouse farts.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.156
That was my rule! Ow! [growls]

01:55.240 --> 01:57.617
How are you so precise
with these spit wads?

02:00.370 --> 02:02.080
[grunting]

02:02.163 --> 02:03.498
I didn't do anything!

[Tim] Ugh!

02:25.687 --> 02:28.690
-I got a little in my mouth.
-Oh, me too.

02:30.358 --> 02:31.776
I'm impressed you tried, Tim,

02:31.860 --> 02:34.946
but I'm not sure you can reason
with a baby.

02:35.029 --> 02:37.240
Maybe you can use the room
for the first half of the day

02:37.323 --> 02:39.117
and let the baby play in there
in the afternoon.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.619
Unacceptable. It's my room.

02:42.328 --> 02:43.621
[crying]

02:43.913 --> 02:46.124
Did you try spit wads
like I've been training you?

02:46.207 --> 02:48.459
Please don't teach him
to spit wad the baby.

02:48.543 --> 02:51.254
Spit wads are a harmless,
long-range way

02:51.337 --> 02:53.256
to keep a kid
on a straight and narrow path.

02:53.339 --> 02:55.425
How do you think my Ted
turned out so sweet?

02:55.592 --> 02:56.968
I'd soak him in the things.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.094
Flashback!

02:58.177 --> 03:00.889
And there goes my appetite. Ah!

03:00.972 --> 03:02.932
-Finish your dinner.
-Yes, Mother.

03:04.100 --> 03:07.687
Tim, I shared a room with six siblings,
all horrible.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.523
Three of them just passed gas non-stop.
Drove me crazy.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.901
So when spit wads didn't work,
you know what I did?

03:12.984 --> 03:14.736
I got out in the neighborhood
and kept busy.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.239
[Tim] So in conclusion,

03:18.323 --> 03:21.159
I want to take
Super Cool Big Kids Incorporated

03:21.242 --> 03:23.745
to the next level: making money.

03:23.828 --> 03:25.496
You had me at "money."

03:25.580 --> 03:27.165
-So, ideas.
-[Boss Baby cooing]

03:27.248 --> 03:28.875
What should our business be?

03:28.958 --> 03:31.044
[gasps] Gum testers.

03:31.127 --> 03:35.089
[gasps] Business bees.
We catch bees for business.

03:35.173 --> 03:36.174
[sighs]

03:36.341 --> 03:38.927
Fart detectors. Who farted? We're on it.

03:39.177 --> 03:40.011
[shocked coo]

03:40.094 --> 03:41.721
We could be turtlesitters.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.474
We would be awesome turtlesitters.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.227
Do we just watch awesome turtles
or cruddy ones, too?

03:47.310 --> 03:49.479

-Eh, we shouldn't discriminate.

03:51.439 --> 03:53.650
What's with your brother? Diaper problems?

03:53.733 --> 03:55.235
He must be hungry or something.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.364
What do you mean "terrible ideas"?

03:59.447 --> 04:01.241
A word of professional advice:

04:01.324 --> 04:03.451
if you want
to build a successful business--

04:03.534 --> 04:05.828
-I'm good.
-Uh, sorry?

04:05.912 --> 04:09.123
I'm trying to find a way for us
to spend some time apart,

04:09.207 --> 04:10.500
for the sake of our brothership.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.877
You're starting a business
without my help?

04:13.086 --> 04:15.255
Would you also do surgery
without a doctor,

04:15.338 --> 04:18.007
or go into space without an astronaut?

04:18.091 --> 04:20.718
Second one, yes. First one, maybe.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.929
[laughing, grunts]

04:23.012 --> 04:25.431
I'm gonna write down rake-punchers.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.850
We're gonna be so rich. [grunts]

04:27.934 --> 04:30.770
See? We already have too many great ideas.

04:30.853 --> 04:32.981
-I do like the confidence.
-[grunts]

04:33.064 --> 04:34.315
A gentleman's wager, then.

04:34.399 --> 04:38.611
You and Danny make, say, $20
by the time the streetlights come on.

04:38.861 --> 04:43.574
Do that, you get exclusive daytime use
of our room for the summer.

04:43.658 --> 04:46.995
If not, this place is mine.
And no more spit wads.

04:47.078 --> 04:50.123
-Twenty dollars before dark.
-The room is the prize.

04:50.206 --> 04:53.626
And some time apart
is the cherry on top. Deal.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.506
[chuckles] Feels nice to come
to an agreement with you,

04:58.589 --> 04:59.632
like the old days.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.759
Hey, you should come
into the office with me.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.136
It's Peg's birthday,

05:03.219 --> 05:05.805
and Hendershot brought
way too much chocolate cake.

05:05.888 --> 05:08.308
Cookie crumbles on top, trick candles.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.977
Yes! Those are hilarious. I'm in.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.228
Wait.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.815
You're just trying to trick me
into getting distracted from my business.

05:15.898 --> 05:18.192
What? Me? No.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.236
Yes. Had to try. Good luck.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.529
Don't need it.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.201
[Turtleneck]
Close your eyes for one second.

05:27.285 --> 05:28.369
Now open them.

05:28.453 --> 05:32.999
Welcome to right now,
formerly known as one second from now.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.417
What's going on?

05:34.500 --> 05:37.754
I think they finally re-figured out how
to make Stinkless Serum.

05:37.837 --> 05:40.840
They've done it?
Then Turtleneck's ready to step down.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.467
They'll need a new CEO.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.302
You're gonna be the boss, boss.

05:44.385 --> 05:49.891
R&D Baby Simmons, tireless, genius.
Hear her speak.

05:49.974 --> 05:52.018
I haven't slept in a week. Whoo!

05:52.226 --> 05:54.395
I think it's affecting my brain. Brain.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.439
Brain, brain, brain, brain, brain, brain.

05:56.522 --> 05:59.317
You ever say a word so much,
it doesn't even sound like a word anymore?

05:59.400 --> 06:02.361
Brain. [laughs]

06:03.446 --> 06:05.615
But I do know this.

06:05.698 --> 06:08.743
We just reinvented Stinkless Serum.

06:08.993 --> 06:10.244
[all gasping]

06:10.411 --> 06:14.082
Now I also haven't showered in a week.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.834
Uh, we know. We can smell.

06:16.918 --> 06:20.713
[chuckles] Good, 'cause now you can watch
those bad smells disappear

06:20.797 --> 06:25.176
through the raw power of Stinkless Serum.

[Danny] We sell pizzas,
but only the toppings.

06:52.912 --> 06:56.374
No. Soda pop with just the bubbles.

Wait. The insides of hot dogs.

06:59.877 --> 07:02.839
-I got it!
-Okay, but I got plenty more in the tank.

07:02.922 --> 07:05.591
Look at these people
just walking around the neighborhood.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.844
I bet they'd love to hire a taxi.

07:07.927 --> 07:11.264
But a taxi won't go
from their porch to their mailbox.

07:11.347 --> 07:15.309
That's where we come in.
We give the rides too short for taxis.

07:15.393 --> 07:18.187
Yes!

07:18.396 --> 07:20.731
We need a wagon and a chair.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.694
-[gasps] What happened?
-Simmons.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.864
Did she get the formula wrong?
Yes, colossally.

07:28.030 --> 07:31.742
She's made herself
the stinkiest baby on the planet.

07:31.826 --> 07:35.621
I can fix it. Just need brain.

07:35.705 --> 07:39.125
Oh. Look how fast my eyes move.
Whoa, whoa. There it goes. Whoa.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.711
No sleep for a week and bad serum.

07:41.794 --> 07:45.840
Totally cuckoo and totally poo-poo.
[chuckles]

07:45.923 --> 07:48.092
Rhymes. How amusing.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.927
I see why music is so popular.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.429
Solution, give me one.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.265
She needs a dose
of original Stinkless Serum.

07:54.348 --> 07:56.225
The vial's still safe. I can bring it in.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.395
No. Spies everywhere.
Serum stays in the field.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.771
Take her to it.

08:00.855 --> 08:04.442
You want me to take her into the field?
Ma'am, that's a huge risk.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.195
My job is making sure people love babies.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.696
What happens when they smell a baby

08:08.779 --> 08:11.073
that stinks like a wet dog
threw up a ham salad?

08:11.157 --> 08:15.203
Solutions haunt us
like the ghosts of our failures.

08:15.286 --> 08:20.583
A true innovator, a future CEO,
fears neither.

08:20.666 --> 08:23.503
So fear is a bronco to be tamed?

08:23.586 --> 08:27.423
You're talking nonsense.
It confuses and enrages me. Stop it.

08:27.590 --> 08:30.092
Uh, yes, ma'am.
Don't worry. I'll take care of this.

08:30.843 --> 08:33.471
[gasping]

08:33.638 --> 08:35.139
You okay? We have work to do.

08:35.223 --> 08:37.350
Too weak to move.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.436
The smell, worse than Jimbo's diapers.

-[coughs]

08:42.230 --> 08:45.900

08:48.110 --> 08:51.948
Right. Looks like it's just you and me,
loopy, sleep-deprived Simmons.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.534
Oh, I have 13 toes.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.286
[Tim] We're the Picker-Uppers.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.289
We pick you up
so you'll never have to walk again.

09:00.373 --> 09:06.003
No trip is too short.
Hop aboard our comfortable chair-agon.

09:06.087 --> 09:10.091
-A wagon with a chair on top.
-But not just any chair.

09:10.174 --> 09:13.844
The finest, most comfortable chair
I could find at the dump.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.973
Did I hear you shouting
about giving rides?

09:18.808 --> 09:19.850
[laughing]

09:19.934 --> 09:22.311
Hey, this is kinda fun.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.236
Ow. Ow! Ow.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.572
[grunting] Ow!

09:32.655 --> 09:34.574
My Teflon shinbone!

09:35.032 --> 09:36.951
Sorry. We'll give you a discount.

09:38.494 --> 09:40.621
A half-hour for a tow truck?

09:40.705 --> 09:43.666
Ah! But all the good crimes
are happening now.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.961
[imitates siren blaring]

09:47.044 --> 09:48.963
Let's get that speeder, boys.

09:50.715 --> 09:53.593
Just three dollars? We worked all morning.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.262
Are you kidding? We did great.

09:56.345 --> 09:57.972
That's at least two candy bars

09:58.055 --> 10:00.433
and tons of change left
to throw at squirrels.

10:00.683 --> 10:03.978
But I need to make $20
before the streetlights come on.

10:04.061 --> 10:06.814
-How do we make more faster?
-I have an idea.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.900
Quick, give me a quarter.
I see you, squirrel!

10:10.067 --> 10:11.652
Eat two bits!

10:12.320 --> 10:14.780
Think, Templeton. Gotta win this bet.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.867
More passengers,
faster trips, higher fares.

10:17.950 --> 10:21.245
Ugh. Missed him. But totally worth it
for the life experience.

10:21.537 --> 10:24.457
We need to upgrade our vehicle.
Do you know anyone with a go-kart?

10:24.790 --> 10:27.084
What? No.

10:27.168 --> 10:31.464
Why would I know anyone with a...
what did you say? Glo-klart?

10:31.547 --> 10:33.299
-[chuckles]
-Do you have a go-kart?

10:33.591 --> 10:36.135
She's not ready for the road yet!

10:36.427 --> 10:37.428
[sniffs]

10:37.511 --> 10:39.472
Fine. Sheesh.

10:39.555 --> 10:41.349
I hope you like fun.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.435
Well, that's the smell contained at least.

10:44.518 --> 10:46.729
If I go grab the serum,
you'll be good here?

10:46.812 --> 10:50.608
Ooh. I've never been out
in the real world before.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.902
I must see everything! [inhales]

10:52.985 --> 10:55.571
Oh. The trees are calling to me.

10:55.988 --> 10:58.366
Business is booming.
So fun being successful.

10:58.574 --> 11:00.326
Just need to quickly grab a helmet.

11:00.701 --> 11:02.161
-Here I come, trees!
-[gasps]

11:03.079 --> 11:04.955
Templeton, were you born in a barn?

11:05.039 --> 11:08.751
Hey, what's Simmons doing here?
And why is she in a ball thing?

11:08.834 --> 11:11.420
Tell me, what's the worst smell
you've ever smelled?

11:11.504 --> 11:12.838
-Dad's socks.
-Fine.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.091
Now imagine those socks
pulled from the gut of a fish.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.008
Ugh!

11:16.092 --> 11:18.803
That's what Simmons smells like,
times a thousand.

11:18.886 --> 11:21.222
If this thing cracks
and anyone smells her,

11:21.305 --> 11:23.224
baby love may never recover.

11:23.307 --> 11:26.268
But if I fix this,
I'm on the fast track to CEO.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.230
I just need a sec.
Can you watch her for me?

11:29.313 --> 11:31.190
I guess if you really need me to--

11:31.273 --> 11:32.274
Wait.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.652
Watch her until the streetlights
come on, right?

11:34.735 --> 11:36.779
I get what you're trying, Sneaky Pete.

11:36.987 --> 11:38.239
What are you talking about?

11:38.322 --> 11:41.367
The wager we made this morning?
I don't even care about that anymore.

11:41.450 --> 11:44.120
Sure. This is a prank, right?

11:44.328 --> 11:47.748
Nothing is real. Not even my eyes.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.793
Ha! I knew it. You almost had me.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.962
-See ya.
-Templeton, wait! [sighs]

11:53.170 --> 11:54.463
Stay put.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.340
[Gigi] High noon. Time for lunch.

11:56.424 --> 11:57.925
Gah! I forgot about Gigi!

11:58.342 --> 11:59.593
Do not move!

12:02.680 --> 12:05.099
No nap yet, mister. Lunchtime.

12:05.182 --> 12:08.227
You're staying on Gigi's strict
character-building schedule.

12:10.938 --> 12:12.982
Here I come, trees!

12:14.108 --> 12:15.443
-[tires screech]
-[gasps]

12:15.651 --> 12:18.696
That's so amazing!

12:18.779 --> 12:21.198
Me and my dad built her
from parts we found at the dump.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.242
She's my Thunder Dumpling.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.368
Wow!

12:24.452 --> 12:25.619
Even feels fast.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.581
Half horsepower engine.
That's triple the power.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.416
And with the backseat
and the wagon attached,

12:30.583 --> 12:32.501
we've doubled our passenger load.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.880
Watch out, neighborhood.
You're about to get picked up.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.882
Let's be successful.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.216
Yeah!

12:39.300 --> 12:40.384
This baby's touchy.

12:40.468 --> 12:43.846
You gotta punch this
and pull that and twist this,

12:43.929 --> 12:45.723
and then a slap on the dash.

12:48.476 --> 12:51.812
-How do you make it go faster?
-Engage thunder pedal.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.565
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

12:57.568 --> 12:59.778
Wow. Love to see that initiative.

13:01.697 --> 13:03.908
[grunting, sighs]

13:04.909 --> 13:06.619
Come on, tummy. We can do this.

13:06.702 --> 13:09.038
Gotta get back to Simmons
before she bolts.

13:10.831 --> 13:13.209
Timmy! Lunchtime!

13:18.047 --> 13:19.173
[coos]

13:19.256 --> 13:20.841
I'm gonna make a sandwich for Tim.

13:21.008 --> 13:23.302
-Be with you in a minute.
-[giggling]

13:23.385 --> 13:25.930
-[ball thuds]
-[Simmons giggling]

13:26.430 --> 13:28.516
Gah! [gasps, cries]

13:28.599 --> 13:31.143
I hear ya. Nap time it is.

13:31.227 --> 13:34.355
But you're waking up in two hours
on the dot.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.234
No, no, no, no, no!

13:42.988 --> 13:46.200
Serum, serum, serum, serum.
[gasps] There you are.

13:50.162 --> 13:51.413
Hire the Picker-Uppers!

13:51.497 --> 13:53.707
Feel the raw power of Thunder Dumpling.

13:53.916 --> 13:57.169
A registered subsidiary
of Super Cool Big Kids Incorporated.

13:58.462 --> 14:00.923
-Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
-What is it?

14:01.006 --> 14:05.010
I got a way to billionaire supercharge
our business. Watch.

14:05.844 --> 14:06.804
Hi, Mr. Willis.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.390
How's the garage sale going?
Where are your customers?

14:09.682 --> 14:12.977
Well, I don't know, Tim.
Maybe I didn't put up enough signs.

14:16.855 --> 14:19.984
You know, Danny and I
have a neighborhood taxi business.

14:20.067 --> 14:23.237
We can drive around,
spread the word about your garage sale,

14:23.320 --> 14:25.197
and give customers rides here.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.115
Sold.

14:28.033 --> 14:31.245
You didn't buy anything?
I'm eyeing one of those spatulas.

14:31.579 --> 14:35.833
He's paying us to bring him customers,
who will pay us to bring them to him.

14:35.916 --> 14:40.754
By the time the streetlights come on,
you'll be buying every spatula in town.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.424
[giggles]
It's like you're reading my dream journal.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.472
Simmons? Simmons?

14:51.348 --> 14:52.766
Where are you?

14:52.850 --> 14:55.060
[panting] Trees, sidewalks.

14:55.144 --> 14:58.147
[grunts] I love outside!

15:01.025 --> 15:04.528
I don't know if you heard,
but Mr. Willis is having a garage sale.

15:05.487 --> 15:08.407
-[gasps]
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! [grunts]

15:08.741 --> 15:13.329
Oh, a small fellow. I wanna pet you.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.331
How do I open it? Aha!

15:18.834 --> 15:21.211
No! Don't let them smell you!

15:21.295 --> 15:24.173
[sniffs] Ah! [retching]

15:25.466 --> 15:28.052
What's your name, huh?

15:28.510 --> 15:29.637
[sniffs] Ah!

15:29.720 --> 15:31.096
What's that smell?

15:31.263 --> 15:32.932
Fried throw-up and onions?

15:33.098 --> 15:35.601
Hi, Mr. Fried Throw-Up and Onions.

15:35.684 --> 15:39.855
I'm R&D Baby Simmons. Very tired brain.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.900
Who wants to watch me run? I do!

15:42.983 --> 15:44.151
[panting, laughing]

15:44.234 --> 15:46.779
No! Simmons, you stop right there!

15:50.407 --> 15:52.201
[coins clinking]

15:52.284 --> 15:55.287
So many customers. Golly!

15:55.371 --> 15:57.206
Think you can find more
where they came from?

15:58.290 --> 16:00.960
[laughing]

16:01.043 --> 16:03.295
[gasps] Ha! Whoa! Ha, ha!

16:03.963 --> 16:06.340
Ah! [retches, coughs]

16:07.383 --> 16:09.510
That smell... [coughs]

16:09.593 --> 16:11.595
Hard to breathe.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.472
Goodbye, baby love.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.933
It was nice knowing you.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.351
[Staci] We got her, BB.

16:17.434 --> 16:20.020
Reinforcements! Ha, ha! I love my team.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.939
Oh, wait. Wait. Your masks!

16:22.022 --> 16:23.607
[Jimbo laughs, gasps]

16:23.691 --> 16:25.567
Clam farts! [grunts]

16:25.651 --> 16:29.113
Diarrhea sushi! [grunts]

16:30.572 --> 16:32.116
Oh, fart poop duty.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.160
Whoa! [grunts]

16:35.369 --> 16:37.746
Just a couple more cartloads,
and we'll make our goal.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.249
Stop at Mrs. Dingle's.
She loves a good bargain.

16:40.332 --> 16:41.166
Sure thing.

16:42.960 --> 16:43.919
-Huh.
-What?

16:44.003 --> 16:45.087
[Danny] Brakes don't work.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.505
-What?
-I told you

16:46.588 --> 16:48.465
Thunder Dumpling
wasn't ready for the road.

16:48.549 --> 16:51.010
What are we gonna do?
Find a safe place to crash.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.429
I'm not crashing this beautiful machine.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.806
We'll just have to drive
until we're out of gas.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.768
Huh. Funny. Nothing's happening.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.062
What do you mean nothing's happening?

17:03.022 --> 17:05.065
Good news. Something happened.

17:05.149 --> 17:08.152
We're about to go down the steepest hill
in the neighborhood.

17:08.235 --> 17:09.570
Hill Street?

17:09.653 --> 17:13.032
Yeah, and it leads down
to the busiest street in town.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.450
Busy Street?

17:14.533 --> 17:16.452
What? No. Main Street.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.537
We'll be crushed! Let's bail.

17:18.620 --> 17:20.539
I'm not bailing on Thunder Dumpling.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.875
It's our lives or your Thunder Dumpling.

17:22.958 --> 17:26.712
If you don't care about Dumpling,
you jump. I'm staying.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.881
-I'm not going without you.
-[car horns honking]

17:28.964 --> 17:30.591
Oh, no.

17:33.886 --> 17:34.928
[horns honking]

17:35.012 --> 17:37.014
[both scream]

17:37.097 --> 17:39.099
-I'm outta here.
-What? You just said--

17:41.643 --> 17:43.520
[grunting]

17:45.481 --> 17:47.858
[screaming]

17:52.362 --> 17:55.115
Out of gas. Boy, we really lucked out.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.619
I almost died and peed.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.245
Psst! Templeton.

18:01.955 --> 18:03.290
[sighs] I need to take a walk.

18:03.791 --> 18:06.085
Cool. I'll see if I can fix Dumpling.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.882
-Ah!
-This Simmons thing, it's real.

18:11.965 --> 18:13.926
She's out of the bubble, and she stinks.

18:14.009 --> 18:16.011
You stink at lying.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.973
You know what's actually real?
I'm this close to winning our bet.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.684
Room, room. Room, room, room,
room, room, room, room!

18:22.851 --> 18:25.187
-How much have you made so far?
-Around $15.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.522
Already?

18:26.814 --> 18:29.691
Let me hire you.
Five dollars to help me catch Simmons.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.360
-What?
-That gets you to 20.

18:31.443 --> 18:32.986
You win the bet, you get the room.

18:33.070 --> 18:35.697
I thought we were spending time apart,
to save our brothership?

18:35.781 --> 18:38.033
I need your help. You need my help.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.120
What's a brothership good for
if we can't come together in a crisis?

18:41.203 --> 18:42.955
[Danny retches, coughs]

18:44.998 --> 18:49.753
Why does this baby smell like a skunk
who eats other skunks' butts?

18:49.837 --> 18:52.172
Oh, it's so sick.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.423
[laughing]

18:53.507 --> 18:54.341
Simmons!

18:54.424 --> 18:56.093
[retching]

18:56.176 --> 18:59.555
It's like dog poop learned how
to poop other poop.

18:59.638 --> 19:02.516
I told you I wasn't lying, this time.

19:02.599 --> 19:05.018
She slowed down, but she's making her way
to that garage sale

19:05.102 --> 19:06.270
at the bottom of the hill.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.480
How are there so many people
at a garage sale?

19:08.564 --> 19:11.692
'Cause I'm a great, boom, businessman.

19:11.859 --> 19:14.486
I'm impressed,
but that crowd only makes this worse.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.781
If they get a whiff of stinky Simmons,
baby love might never recover.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.450
Forget the CEO job. My career is over.

19:20.534 --> 19:24.204
-Can we take the go-kart?
-I mean, it's totally broken, but...

19:27.708 --> 19:28.542
The plan again?

19:28.625 --> 19:31.503
Can't steer or stop.
We need a perfect glide.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.422
If she still stinks, we'll faint.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.883
Then it's all up
to your disgusting talent.

19:35.966 --> 19:39.970
One shot, one chance.
It's stinkless or get stunk.

19:40.053 --> 19:42.764
Trust me.
I can spit wad anything that moves.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.475
That's disgusting but comforting. Scooch!

19:49.521 --> 19:51.190
[laughing]

19:52.983 --> 19:54.067
Hey, Simmons!

19:55.360 --> 19:56.904
Templeton, now!

20:01.742 --> 20:02.659
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

20:02.743 --> 20:04.995
No more stinky Simmons. That was easy.

20:05.078 --> 20:05.996
[Tim screams]

20:06.079 --> 20:07.581
-[all gasping]
-What the-- What, what?

20:07.664 --> 20:09.666
[screaming]

20:09.750 --> 20:11.001
[man] Whoa!

20:12.044 --> 20:14.379
[both grunt]

20:14.671 --> 20:16.673
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

20:16.757 --> 20:20.844
Boss Baby, giant hot dog person. [laughs]

20:20.928 --> 20:23.347
I've been awake for all the hours.

20:23.430 --> 20:26.725
[snoring]

20:26.808 --> 20:28.477
Well, it's been a long day.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.563
[elevator dings]

20:31.647 --> 20:34.233
-[Simmons] Hello.
-[all gasping]

20:34.316 --> 20:38.320
-Fear not, babies. She stinks no more.
-[all] Phew!

20:40.447 --> 20:45.035
Boss Baby,
that was CEO-quality problem-solving.

20:45.118 --> 20:48.914
In you, I see our future.

20:49.539 --> 20:52.918
Simmons! How's my rock star change agent?

20:53.001 --> 20:55.295
That was CEO-quality risk-taking.

20:55.545 --> 20:58.590
In you, I see our future.

20:58.674 --> 21:02.261
Uh, I thought I was being groomed
to be the next CEO.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.805
Of course you are. As is everyone else.

21:04.888 --> 21:09.935
Eating a carrot kills hunger,
but chasing a carrot births innovation.

21:10.018 --> 21:12.062
Cutthroat. I like it.

21:12.854 --> 21:15.399
-No, I don't.
-[Turtleneck] Nice pants, Hendershot.

21:15.482 --> 21:18.902
In them, I see our future.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.616
What happened to my kart?

21:24.783 --> 21:26.201
It crashed down the hill.

21:26.285 --> 21:30.163
And I had to pay Mr. Willis our profits.
We just have a few cents left.

21:30.956 --> 21:31.957
I'm really sorry.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.543
Maybe you and I aren't meant
to be business partners.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.545
-I'm happy just being your--
-Squirrel!

21:36.753 --> 21:39.506
Watch your tail, acorn smuggler!

21:40.549 --> 21:42.050
[crickets chirping]

21:43.051 --> 21:44.803
Well, good news for you.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.514
I lost the bet, you won. Enjoy the room.

21:47.597 --> 21:48.807
Oh, forget the bet.

21:48.890 --> 21:51.560
You made more money in a half-day
than I thought you could in a week.

21:51.643 --> 21:54.062
You helped me with Simmons
and saved my career.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.815
Certainly, we can figure out
how to share this room.

21:56.898 --> 21:58.650
I do have a few ideas.

22:00.277 --> 22:01.653
It's raining dinosaurs.

22:03.363 --> 22:06.033
How will Timothy Thrasherton,
Jurassic rock star,

22:06.116 --> 22:07.367
make it to the big show?

22:07.451 --> 22:08.785
Thrasherton!

22:10.120 --> 22:12.289
I'm interested in becoming your manager.

22:12.581 --> 22:15.459
I can protect you from dino rain,
but I take 20%.

22:15.542 --> 22:17.377
[strikes note] 10%!

22:17.586 --> 22:19.880
Well, have fun being crushed by dinosaurs.

22:19.963 --> 22:22.049
-Fifteen.
-Deal. Hop on.

22:22.132 --> 22:24.760
-A rake?
-This is no ordinary rake.

22:24.843 --> 22:27.971
And away we go!
Fend off the dinosaurs!

22:28.055 --> 22:31.308
It's so fast!
I bet no dinosaur could catch up with us.

22:31.391 --> 22:34.478
[Boss Baby] Bye-bye, triceratops!
Take that, tyrannosaurus!

22:34.561 --> 22:36.980
