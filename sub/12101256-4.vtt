14:14.688 --> 14:16.429
Huh?

14:16.464 --> 14:18.606
What does that mean?

14:23.012 --> 14:25.521
What does that mean?

14:25.532 --> 14:29.609
I'm experimenting
with a new serum.

14:29.685 --> 14:31.611
It's all a little jazz hands-y
right now

14:31.646 --> 14:35.031
but I think I figured out
the mixture.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.699
It's the dosage
that's a little tricky.

14:36.710 --> 14:37.867
Oh.

14:37.878 --> 14:41.537
You stuck me again,
didn't you, Doc?

14:41.548 --> 14:44.165
You know how much
I hate needles.

14:44.241 --> 14:46.718
Well, it was either that
or dying, bud.

14:47.578 --> 14:48.127
Axel?

14:48.162 --> 14:49.387
He's fine.

14:49.464 --> 14:50.880
He's itching to get out of here

14:50.891 --> 14:54.050
but we're not gonna go anywhere
until you're better.

14:54.060 --> 14:54.967
Leave me.

14:55.002 --> 14:55.718
What?

14:55.729 --> 14:56.652
No, you gotta leave me now.

14:56.654 --> 14:58.721
Violet and Jack,
they need your help.

14:58.732 --> 14:59.639
Now.

14:59.674 --> 15:00.565
Ok, you need to calm down.

15:00.642 --> 15:03.643
No, you don't get it.
They are the answer.

15:03.678 --> 15:05.019
They just-

15:05.096 --> 15:07.030
Ok, you need to calm down.

15:09.058 --> 15:11.409
We'll get to them, I promise.

15:19.777 --> 15:21.377
[exhales]

15:25.908 --> 15:30.503
Axel told me you never
gave up on me.

15:30.538 --> 15:33.514
Looks like it's mutual.

15:37.128 --> 15:39.178
[alarm sounds]

15:39.255 --> 15:40.930
What's that?

15:40.941 --> 15:42.098
Be right back.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.733
Ok.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.602
I'll be right here.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.437
Hey! Hey!

15:48.448 --> 15:49.939
That's a perimeter breach.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.774
The door's sealed,
there's no sign of entry.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.776
Then what? False alarm?

15:53.787 --> 15:55.495
Yeah, maybe.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.698
Do you know how to shut
this thing off?

15:58.733 --> 16:01.534
No, and I'm a little gun shy
about pulling plugs

16:01.610 --> 16:03.536
seeing as all the doors have
electric locks.

16:03.612 --> 16:05.037
Yeah, fair enough.

16:05.072 --> 16:06.580
[alarm continues]

16:06.657 --> 16:08.916
What's going on with that one?

16:08.993 --> 16:10.584
Could it be there?

16:10.661 --> 16:12.962
It's just an air duct, can't be
more than a few feet wide.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.765
Yeah, those things can't fit
in there.

16:16.718 --> 16:17.892
[alarm stops]

16:20.296 --> 16:21.938
False alarm?

16:23.674 --> 16:25.191
Yeah, maybe.

16:28.062 --> 16:29.404
Ok.

16:44.111 --> 16:45.670
Two echo Charlie.
Detention level.

16:45.747 --> 16:46.787
Threat level alpha.

16:46.864 --> 16:47.997
Seal all exits.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.507
Get me a list of every person

16:49.584 --> 16:52.051
who's exited every goddamn door
in this place.

16:53.204 --> 16:55.680
Um... Sergeant?

16:55.757 --> 16:56.514
You said Fort Collins is still

16:56.591 --> 16:58.683
under presidential lockdown,
right?

16:58.760 --> 17:00.518
Got the place surrounded
with motion sensors

17:00.595 --> 17:04.764
so how would they get past your
perimeter without you knowing?

17:04.799 --> 17:05.765
I don't know.
You tell me.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.183
They escaped on your watch.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.601
I mean- it doesn't make sense.

17:08.636 --> 17:09.852
It's a dead end.

17:09.863 --> 17:10.953
What'd you find?

17:10.955 --> 17:15.241
Apparently I just accessed
utilities room B.

17:15.869 --> 17:17.985
And where exactly is this?

17:18.062 --> 17:19.120
Stay down!

17:19.873 --> 17:21.614
We just wanna show
you something.

17:21.690 --> 17:23.199
After that we're all yours.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.058
You have our word.

17:24.135 --> 17:27.670
Your word doesn't count
for shit.

17:28.289 --> 17:32.208
Maybe we should execute you
traitors right here, right now.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.401
What if you're wrong?

17:33.477 --> 17:37.638
Ask yourself "why would
they erase the security tapes?".

17:40.167 --> 17:41.884
Maybe you two did that.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.969
The only way to know for sure
is to hit the space bar

17:44.046 --> 17:46.939
on that computer.

17:52.146 --> 17:55.573
My father kept a back up server
of all the security footage.

17:55.650 --> 17:58.076
They didn't know it's down there
so it never got erased.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.588

18:47.127 --> 18:51.287
Blue bullets are just a failed
prototype but these?

18:51.297 --> 18:55.875
These'll take out daywalkers.

18:55.910 --> 18:59.804
I don't know if it'll take down
those monsters outside,

18:59.881 --> 19:02.423
I suppose we'd have to shoot one
to find out.

19:02.499 --> 19:07.094
But hopefully it slows them up
enough for us to escape.

19:07.171 --> 19:07.928
<i> Doc?</i>

19:08.005 --> 19:09.272
Huh?

19:16.397 --> 19:18.698
One down, 300 more to go.

19:22.311 --> 19:24.245
[dripping]

19:32.914 --> 19:33.854
Hey.

19:33.931 --> 19:37.791
I think I have a solution
to our problem.

19:37.868 --> 19:39.793
That's great, Doc.

19:39.870 --> 19:41.295
What?

19:41.372 --> 19:42.463
I don't know.

19:42.539 --> 19:44.006
Something.

19:44.017 --> 19:44.849
Hold this for a sec?

19:44.926 --> 19:46.017
Yeah.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.266
I thought you said they couldn't
get up into the vent.

19:54.343 --> 19:56.268
No, you said that.

19:56.345 --> 19:57.278
I...

19:58.305 --> 20:00.981
Fine, but you agreed.

20:01.058 --> 20:02.992
Maybe we're both right.

20:08.857 --> 20:10.833
Nothing, right?

20:14.571 --> 20:16.038
What?

20:16.049 --> 20:17.089
It's in the duct.

20:18.158 --> 20:19.166
One of them tore the other apart
so it would fit.

20:19.243 --> 20:20.176
Shit.

20:20.795 --> 20:22.461
[hissing]

20:22.496 --> 20:24.964
Uh, I'll get Julius to the OR,
there's a vault back there.

20:25.040 --> 20:25.890
Go for it.

20:25.967 --> 20:26.891
Woah, woah, woah!
Woah, woah, woah, woah.

20:26.968 --> 20:28.059
No, no, no, no, no.

20:28.135 --> 20:29.393
You're not thinking of throwing
that in there, were you?

20:29.470 --> 20:30.469
Well, I kinda was.

20:30.504 --> 20:32.012
No. Gas lines run throughout
this entire place.

20:32.089 --> 20:33.222
You'll kill us all.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.348
Um...

20:34.425 --> 20:35.891
Why does it always gotta
be the hard way?

20:35.902 --> 20:36.751
Hold on.

20:36.827 --> 20:38.811
I got a bullet that
needs testing.

20:38.846 --> 20:40.780
It's perfect. It's perfect!

20:42.057 --> 20:44.316
I got different ideas
about perfect, Doc.

22:28.122 --> 22:31.515
Just about enough to piss him
off some more.

22:31.592 --> 22:33.842
He knows that's the only way
in and out of here.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.512
He'll try and coax us
into a trap, I'm sure of it.

22:36.522 --> 22:37.688
How do you know that?

22:37.765 --> 22:40.307
Because that's Dr. Marcello.

22:40.384 --> 22:42.434
Oh, a friend of yours.

22:42.511 --> 22:43.977
He designed that orange shit.

His ego's the reason
we're in this mess.

27:47.908 --> 27:49.741
otherwise I'd be in a chopper
on my way to D.C.

27:49.818 --> 27:53.412
with your heads in a cooler
right now.

27:53.447 --> 27:54.713
Oh, thank god.

27:59.453 --> 28:02.421
[amulet whispering]

28:02.456 --> 28:04.297
What?

28:04.374 --> 28:06.466
What is it?

28:06.543 --> 28:08.343
[whispering continues]

28:08.354 --> 28:11.397
It's... it's like the blood
has changed somehow.

28:17.271 --> 28:18.237
Violet, no!

28:21.942 --> 28:24.151
The Dark One got inside
my head.

28:24.227 --> 28:27.112
I wasn't prepared.

28:27.189 --> 28:28.488
Last time I saw smoke
like that

28:28.565 --> 28:32.200
was when the Dark One
emerged from Sam.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.837
What if this smoke is somehow
a piece of her?

28:40.368 --> 28:41.334
So it's true.

28:41.411 --> 28:43.170
You're addressing the nation?

28:43.246 --> 28:45.338
On live television.

28:45.415 --> 28:46.890
For what reason?

28:46.967 --> 28:49.727
And why wasn't I briefed?

28:49.803 --> 28:51.395
You of all people should know
that the matters

28:51.472 --> 28:55.274
of the president are on
a need-to-know basis.

29:05.393 --> 29:09.237
Madam President,

29:09.248 --> 29:12.541
you're not acting like
the leader I swore to follow.

29:14.495 --> 29:19.206
Checks and balances.

29:19.282 --> 29:22.760
That's what this democracy
was founded on.

29:22.836 --> 29:29.141
A term designed to quell
the masses.

29:38.778 --> 29:42.687
Moments like this.

29:42.764 --> 29:45.407
They define a presidency.

29:47.644 --> 29:51.196
Make sure you're on the right
side of history

29:51.273 --> 29:54.291
or the people will rise up.

30:01.408 --> 30:03.342
[message alert]

30:05.453 --> 30:07.254
[sighs]

30:07.330 --> 30:10.549
Excuse me, I have to take
a call from Fort Collins.

30:10.584 --> 30:12.810
The executions must be over.

30:17.007 --> 30:20.234
[door opens, closes]

30:20.844 --> 30:22.528
Perfect.

30:22.896 --> 30:26.481
How did a piece of the dark
one get inside the amulet?

30:26.492 --> 30:28.367
It's not possible.

30:28.685 --> 30:30.994
Ladies, I'm afraid you're
gonna have to speed up.

30:31.071 --> 30:33.989
Washington didn't buy
my execution story.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.333
They'll have boots on the
ground in less than four hours.

30:36.410 --> 30:37.784
That doesn't give us
much lead time.

30:37.861 --> 30:39.578
Well, we're gonna have to figure
it out on the run.

30:39.613 --> 30:40.929
The less I know the better.

30:40.931 --> 30:42.831
I'll have my men get you geared
up and out as soon as possible.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.916
Thank you for believing in us.

30:44.951 --> 30:46.385
Huh.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.004
I'm country first.

30:49.014 --> 30:52.591
If some demon has our nation
under her thumb

30:52.667 --> 30:55.510
I'm willing to do whatever it
takes to cut that thumb off.

30:55.521 --> 30:56.854
Let's move it.

30:56.930 --> 30:58.355
Alright, you see this?

30:58.432 --> 30:59.598
Look.

30:59.633 --> 31:03.026
This is all you need.

31:03.103 --> 31:04.019
You got it?

31:04.029 --> 31:04.811
I got it.

31:04.888 --> 31:06.530
I'm serious.

31:06.607 --> 31:08.940
I don't know how stable
this new serum is.

31:08.975 --> 31:10.609
It'll help you
heal incrementally,

31:10.644 --> 31:12.944
you might even feel
enhanced adrenaline,

31:12.979 --> 31:16.615
enhanced strength, but even
this small amount is danger-

31:16.650 --> 31:18.450
Hey, Julius.

31:18.485 --> 31:21.036
Any more than this and
your heart could explode.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.662
More than a drop,
ticker goes pop.

31:22.739 --> 31:24.539
I get it.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.716
Truck's ready to roll.

31:25.792 --> 31:28.501
Fort Collins has got me on hold,
can you believe that shit?

31:28.578 --> 31:29.595
Let's load up.

31:30.464 --> 31:32.505
<i> Violet: Attention unit.</i>
<i> Are you there?</i>

31:32.582 --> 31:34.007
This is sunshine unit.

31:34.084 --> 31:35.342
<i> That you, Violet?</i>

31:35.418 --> 31:36.560
Axel?

31:36.637 --> 31:37.469
<i> How's Jack?</i>

31:37.504 --> 31:39.679
We gotta talk.
We're heading back soon.

31:39.756 --> 31:41.306
Jack never came back.

31:41.341 --> 31:41.973
<i> It was the Dark One.</i>

31:42.008 --> 31:43.007
<i> She killed the President,</i>

31:43.085 --> 31:44.851
<i> took her form and escaped</i>
<i> with the Oracle.</i>

31:44.928 --> 31:45.810
<i> We're headed-</i>

31:45.845 --> 31:48.688
Stop talking! This is
not a secure line.

31:48.765 --> 31:49.814
Do not tell me where
you're going.

31:49.891 --> 31:51.566
Don't tell anyone.

31:51.577 --> 31:54.486
<i> I'll find you. You hear me?</i>

31:54.562 --> 31:55.695
<i> I know you will, Axel.</i>

31:55.772 --> 31:56.854
One other thing,

31:56.932 --> 31:58.698
there's some orange powder
floating around out here.

31:58.775 --> 32:00.584
<i> It's deadly to both humans</i>
<i> and vampires.</i>

32:00.661 --> 32:02.419
<i> You gotta avoid it at all costs</i>

32:02.496 --> 32:04.037
<i> Use masks whenever you can,</i>
<i> you got me?</i>

32:04.114 --> 32:04.913
Got it.

32:04.924 --> 32:06.298
<i> See you soon.</i>

32:06.866 --> 32:08.926
<i> That was Vi.</i>
<i> Change of plans.</i>

32:09.002 --> 32:10.418
We gotta move.

32:10.429 --> 32:11.044
I'll explain on the way.

32:11.121 --> 32:12.045
Is she ok?

32:12.122 --> 32:13.597
Seems so.

32:14.749 --> 32:16.016
Doc, you coming?

32:18.178 --> 32:20.720
No.

32:20.797 --> 32:23.515
This is the end of the road
for me.

32:23.550 --> 32:26.685
I um...

32:26.720 --> 32:29.688
I made as many bullets
as I could

32:29.723 --> 32:35.035
so please use them sparingly.

32:37.197 --> 32:38.530
You sure about this?

32:38.606 --> 32:41.583
You told me where
to find Jolene so...

32:44.129 --> 32:46.630
It's been a good ride.

32:56.583 --> 32:58.016
Nacho cheese.

32:58.477 --> 32:59.718
Nacho cheese.

32:59.753 --> 33:02.396
[laughs]

33:04.007 --> 33:06.975
Are you gonna be ok?

33:06.986 --> 33:10.061
Yeah, I will.

33:10.138 --> 33:11.947
When I find her.

33:14.517 --> 33:15.567
Ok, ok.

33:15.602 --> 33:15.993
You guys, go.

33:16.069 --> 33:17.536
Go. Go.

33:26.246 --> 33:27.504
[beep]

33:27.581 --> 33:29.673
[door opens, closes]

33:33.495 --> 33:35.003
Ever since the rising we have
been fighting

33:35.014 --> 33:38.631
against an unspeakable evil.

33:38.708 --> 33:41.468
We thought we had turned a
corner and taken the fight back

33:41.544 --> 33:46.014
to them when a recent broadcast
showed a woman

33:46.025 --> 33:51.144
turning a vampire human again,
giving us new hope.

33:51.221 --> 33:54.939
Sadly, I have learned that
this broadcast was a hoax,

33:55.016 --> 33:58.818
perpetrated by a new breed
of vampire.

33:58.895 --> 34:03.448
Vampires that tried
to assassinate me.

34:03.525 --> 34:05.700
Yes, we have a new threat
to America,

34:05.711 --> 34:10.830
one that we must be
extra vigilant in fighting.

34:10.907 --> 34:14.959
These vampires can appear human
at will and we have credible

34:15.036 --> 34:19.839
intelligence that they walk
among us as I speak to you now.

34:19.916 --> 34:22.801
They can be anyone.

34:22.836 --> 34:29.516
A neighbour, a co-worker,
even a friend.

34:29.592 --> 34:34.145
Now, I know this sounds
frightening, because it is.

34:34.222 --> 34:36.314
It is my sworn duty to protect
this nation

34:36.349 --> 34:38.149
under the powers
of the constitution

34:38.184 --> 34:41.236
and that is what
I intend to do,

34:41.246 --> 34:45.490
so I hear by declare martial law
effective immediately.

34:45.567 --> 34:46.741
There will be a curfew.

34:46.752 --> 34:49.086
Search warrants will no longer
be required,

34:49.162 --> 34:52.089
and my personal security team
will run the White House.

34:52.165 --> 34:55.592
Now, I know this
sounds unpleasant.

34:55.669 --> 34:58.586
Even unAmerican.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.673
But it is a small sacrifice
to ensure that we survive,

35:01.708 --> 35:07.011
not only as Americans,
but as a species.

35:07.088 --> 35:08.680
Fear not.

35:08.756 --> 35:14.561
I know how to track this threat
and pluck them like weeds.

35:14.637 --> 35:19.023
Trust in me and we will survive.

35:19.100 --> 35:25.497
Fight against me... well, that
would be siding with the enemy.

35:26.867 --> 35:32.003
Ask yourself what side
are you on, America?

35:40.046 --> 35:42.806
<i> Did one last sweep of 'em.</i>
<i> That's the last one.</i>

35:42.883 --> 35:44.683
<i> Everybody's on board.</i>

35:45.385 --> 35:46.718
-Jolene.
-What?

35:46.753 --> 35:48.553
It's time to go.

35:48.588 --> 35:49.813
We can't wait here,
you said it yourself.

35:49.890 --> 35:50.647
It's not safe.

35:50.724 --> 35:52.732
Yeah, I guess I did.

36:21.588 --> 36:24.297
[cries softly]

36:24.374 --> 36:25.932
You found me.

36:31.130 --> 36:33.523
I never lost you.

36:58.959 --> 37:02.877
Through thick and thin.

37:02.888 --> 37:09.509
Good and bad.

37:09.585 --> 37:12.854
All I ever wanted was you.

38:36.056 --> 38:39.223
Your speech was magnificent.

38:39.258 --> 38:42.894
I could feel all their eyes
upon me.

38:42.929 --> 38:49.868
The fear and adulation radiating
out of them was intoxicating.

38:55.241 --> 38:57.784
What is it, master?

38:57.860 --> 39:04.007
I had hoped this feed would
give me vigour but,

39:04.084 --> 39:07.919
alas, not until I am whole again
will I have my full strength.

39:07.954 --> 39:10.797
We'll find what has been lost.

39:10.873 --> 39:12.507
We will.

39:12.517 --> 39:17.595
I will have it delivered.

39:17.630 --> 39:20.765
Along with the
Van Helsing's head,

39:20.800 --> 39:23.568
as I have promised.

39:27.107 --> 39:33.528
Your loyalty to me, Bathory,
is the only thing that I trust.

39:33.538 --> 39:39.918
It is your methods
I find ineffective.

39:46.218 --> 39:47.926
Hmm.

39:49.295 --> 39:54.057
Tell me, my dear,
what did you see?

39:54.134 --> 39:56.059
A vision?

39:56.136 --> 40:01.731
I... I saw your victory,
my love.

40:01.808 --> 40:06.069
You standing atop the corpses
of your enemies.

40:06.146 --> 40:07.812
Together?

40:07.889 --> 40:09.823
Of course.

40:19.659 --> 40:23.962
[cards shuffling]

40:41.797 --> 40:46.651
[whispering]

40:48.613 --> 40:51.489
[evil laughter]

41:11.994 --> 41:15.138
I can feel my power returning.

41:15.215 --> 41:17.924
But only just a taste.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.686
Part of me still
remains captive.

41:34.159 --> 41:38.286
From my blood comes death.

41:40.648 --> 41:43.666
Darkness brings my death.

41:44.694 --> 41:51.674
From the realm of darkness,
rise, my child.

41:53.202 --> 41:55.053
Rise!

41:56.706 --> 41:58.014
By what hand?

42:01.836 --> 42:03.686
The fool.

42:03.763 --> 42:05.855
Bringer of chaos.

42:05.932 --> 42:08.024
Go, my pet.

42:08.101 --> 42:10.818
Fetch what I desire.

42:22.732 --> 42:23.957
Jack.

42:27.987 --> 42:29.587
Violet.

42:30.990 --> 42:32.382
Vanessa.

42:33.492 --> 42:34.926
Jack.

42:36.996 --> 42:38.263
Violet.

42:40.300 --> 42:41.641
Vanessa.

42:42.710 --> 42:43.643
Jack...

42:47.173 --> 42:48.139
Stop!

42:48.215 --> 42:51.150
[cackling]
