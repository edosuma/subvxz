A Dutch baby pancake.

Derived from
the German <i>Pfannkuchen.</i>

that Mom is out of a job?

02:56.419 --> 02:58.022
I understand.

02:58.022 --> 03:00.895
It is a time of transition,

I mean, that's...
Hold up.

19:31.675 --> 19:34.413
No, my left stung then,
it stings now, believe that.

19:34.413 --> 19:36.016
Oh, we believe that,
we believe...
RIGGS: Well, no, no, no.

19:36.016 --> 19:37.787
It kind of stings
like a baby mosquito.

19:37.787 --> 19:39.489
And, I mean, that's when you
were in your prime, which...

19:39.489 --> 19:41.427
Did he just say
"stings like a mosquito"?

19:41.427 --> 19:42.295
RIGGS:
No, no, no,

19:42.295 --> 19:43.331
I said a "baby mosquito."

19:43.331 --> 19:45.034
They're like a mosquito,
but they're just,

19:45.034 --> 19:46.571
they're tiny and they're
much cuter and...

19:46.571 --> 19:47.640
Riggs, what are you doing?

19:47.640 --> 19:50.913
Well, I'm trying to pay
the man a compliment.

19:50.913 --> 19:52.315
I mean, he went 12 rounds

19:52.315 --> 19:53.919
with an actual champ
and has no left hook.

19:53.919 --> 19:55.321
Like, that's impressive.

19:55.321 --> 19:56.658
No left hook? You know what?

19:56.658 --> 19:57.960
Tell your friend here...
MURTAUGH: He's a partner.

19:57.960 --> 20:00.532
It's not an ideal situation.

20:00.532 --> 20:03.805
You know, I'd be happy...
to show you my left hook.

20:03.805 --> 20:07.680
Oh. Well, I'd love
to try it on for size.

20:07.680 --> 20:08.615
I'm gonna give you

20:08.615 --> 20:11.588
one free shot, off
the books, right here.

20:11.588 --> 20:12.857
Right here.
What do you say?

20:13.592 --> 20:14.459
(grunts)

20:15.562 --> 20:16.598
(groans)

20:20.839 --> 20:22.643
(sighs)

20:22.643 --> 20:24.112
You happy now?

20:24.112 --> 20:26.150
Ow.

20:26.150 --> 20:27.887
Getting there.

20:31.594 --> 20:33.064
AVERY: So you're saying
the only way Riggs

20:33.064 --> 20:35.168
could get an analysis
of the ring was to have

20:35.168 --> 20:37.005
a heavyweight champion
punch him in the face?

20:37.005 --> 20:38.240
No. There were other options.

20:38.240 --> 20:40.813
Riggs just chose the one that
got him punched in the face.

20:40.813 --> 20:42.482
Does this boxer Benny
have a motive?

20:42.482 --> 20:43.752
Control of Jesse.

20:43.752 --> 20:45.622
Benny had a lot invested in him.

20:45.622 --> 20:48.762
He wanted to manage his career,
but Steven wasn't into it.

20:48.762 --> 20:49.964
He didn't trust Benny.

20:49.964 --> 20:51.668
Managing Jesse could
be a huge payday.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.705
When Marcus Hart went pro
from Coastal State,

20:53.705 --> 20:55.509
he signed a
$7 million deal.

20:55.509 --> 20:58.047
How do you know everything
about every Coastal player?

20:58.047 --> 20:59.917
It's not like
you even played.

20:59.917 --> 21:02.155
Oh, I played‐‐
in the marching band.

21:02.155 --> 21:04.159
You have to practice
the same amount of hours.

21:04.159 --> 21:05.596
I probably logged
more field hours...

21:05.596 --> 21:06.898
Stop.

21:06.898 --> 21:08.167
Just stop.

21:08.167 --> 21:10.171
Okay. Get Bailey
on surveillance.

21:10.171 --> 21:12.008
Maybe Benny'll
give us something

21:12.008 --> 21:14.012
that'll attach him
to the shootings.

21:14.012 --> 21:15.816
And the French horn
is very difficult.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.953
It's much more difficult
than the regular horn

21:17.953 --> 21:20.091
because it's French.

21:23.765 --> 21:24.767
(electronic chime)

21:24.767 --> 21:26.538
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Please say a command.

21:26.538 --> 21:28.074
Call Roger Murtaugh.

21:28.074 --> 21:30.178
Calling Roger Murtaugh on cell.

21:30.178 --> 21:31.915
(phone rings)

21:31.915 --> 21:33.919
Hey, what's up, Mike?

21:33.919 --> 21:35.556
Hey, I got a proposition
for you.

21:35.556 --> 21:36.825
Come on, you know
I'm married.

21:36.825 --> 21:37.827
(chuckles)

21:37.827 --> 21:40.699
Consider taking my job.

21:40.699 --> 21:43.538
I'm gonna retire,
and I already mentioned you

21:43.538 --> 21:45.108
to the guy that makes
the decisions here, so...

21:45.108 --> 21:46.578
Ho‐Hold on.

21:46.578 --> 21:49.750
I know you love
being a cop, Roger.

21:49.750 --> 21:51.253
I did, too.

21:51.253 --> 21:54.627
I thought I was gonna miss
my gun and my badge,

21:54.627 --> 21:57.499
chasing bad guys, but I don't.

21:57.499 --> 21:58.635
Not even a little.

21:58.635 --> 22:00.606
Is that your tooth?

22:00.606 --> 22:04.079
Yeah. Can you come over here
and hold it for me?

22:04.079 --> 22:07.987
Look, the point is,
the perks go on and on.

22:07.987 --> 22:10.926
I'm talking a suit allowance,
a sleek Ford Explorer,

22:10.926 --> 22:12.563
the whole package.

22:12.563 --> 22:14.967
I mean, you're at
the last exit ramp, man.

22:14.967 --> 22:18.942
You want to be stuck
where you are forever?

22:18.942 --> 22:20.846
MURTAUGH: <i>The guy gets himself</i>
<i>punched in the face</i>

22:20.846 --> 22:23.117
and then, boop, he puts
the tooth back in his head

22:23.117 --> 22:24.587
with rubber cement.

22:24.587 --> 22:25.956
I ju‐‐ I just can't.

22:25.956 --> 22:28.728
(laughs)
So, get him a dentist.

22:28.728 --> 22:31.568
Or there's another option.

22:31.568 --> 22:32.636
Hmm?

22:32.636 --> 22:33.705
I got a job offer.

22:35.141 --> 22:38.848
A job offer?
What kind of job?

22:38.848 --> 22:40.986
Head of security
at Coastal State.

22:40.986 --> 22:44.159
Head of security? Whoa.

22:44.159 --> 22:45.762
That's like
a real job offer.

22:45.762 --> 22:47.031
Mm‐hmm.

22:47.031 --> 22:48.902
What does it entail?

22:48.902 --> 22:50.639
Well, for starters,
there's no Riggs.

22:50.639 --> 22:52.743
It's a 9:00 to 5:00,

22:52.743 --> 22:56.216
low stress, I get tickets
to the game and free tuition.

22:56.216 --> 22:58.788
Plus, I'll be making almost
triple what I'm making now.

22:58.788 --> 22:59.790
RIANA:
Hell yeah!

22:59.790 --> 23:00.959
Get that in writing.

23:00.959 --> 23:03.598
Go. You're not supposed to be
listening or cussing.

23:03.598 --> 23:04.867
I'm always doing both.

23:04.867 --> 23:05.969
(whispers):
Hey.

23:07.138 --> 23:08.975
Look, it's not a done deal yet,

23:08.975 --> 23:10.879
but it doesn't hurt to
take the meeting, right?

23:10.879 --> 23:12.983
RIANA:
Take the meeting!

23:24.272 --> 23:25.909
(groans)

23:25.909 --> 23:28.314
PALMER:
Hey, it's me.

23:28.314 --> 23:30.619
Uh, pretty sure
I was amazing in the sack,

23:30.619 --> 23:32.556
and yet you haven't called,

23:32.556 --> 23:35.762
which means, (chuckles) like,
you overdosed on spray cheese?

23:35.762 --> 23:37.633
Try to get clean
by tomorrow night.

23:37.633 --> 23:39.637
Same hotel, room service.
Or not.

23:39.637 --> 23:42.241
You know, I can eat
ten sliders on my own anyway.

23:42.241 --> 23:44.045
(phone beeps)

23:47.118 --> 23:49.089
♪ ♪

24:19.115 --> 24:21.052
♪ ♪

24:36.082 --> 24:38.153
(thunder rumbling softly)

24:46.904 --> 24:48.040
What's up? How we doing?

24:48.040 --> 24:49.375
What the hell happened
to your head?

24:49.375 --> 24:51.012
What?

24:51.012 --> 24:52.114
Oh.

24:52.114 --> 24:53.250
Are you okay?

24:53.250 --> 24:54.854
Oh, yeah. It's nothing.

24:54.854 --> 24:56.858
Just a, uh...

24:56.858 --> 24:58.862
You should see
the other guy. You know?

24:58.862 --> 25:00.732
So, what do we got?

25:00.732 --> 25:02.669
BAILEY: Surveillance
on Benny Barnes.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.807
He's been waiting at the table
for about 40 minutes.

25:04.807 --> 25:07.278
You didn't happen to order
a chili‐cheeseburger, did you?

25:07.278 --> 25:08.715
I'm starving.

25:08.715 --> 25:09.884
I'm a vegetarian.

25:09.884 --> 25:11.219
Hmm.

25:11.219 --> 25:12.990
We've had
this conversation before.

25:12.990 --> 25:15.762
And I was there
when we had that conversation?

25:17.699 --> 25:19.235
Oh.

25:19.235 --> 25:20.739
Here we go.

25:20.739 --> 25:21.908
Looks like Benny's
date arrived.

25:25.982 --> 25:27.719
(camera clicking)
Wait a minute,
I know that guy.

25:27.719 --> 25:29.389
How do you
know that guy?

25:29.389 --> 25:31.126
He was at the
hospital yesterday

25:31.126 --> 25:33.397
visiting Jesse.

25:33.397 --> 25:35.067
Some big alumni booster.

25:35.067 --> 25:36.604
Walter Hancock.

25:38.675 --> 25:40.144
Hey. Look, you stay with Benny.

25:40.144 --> 25:41.881
I'm gonna go follow Hancock.
I'm on it.

25:41.881 --> 25:44.285
Oh, and by the way,

25:44.285 --> 25:46.757
really good conversation
that we had here.

25:46.757 --> 25:48.360
Really‐‐ I'm gonna
remember that.

25:54.305 --> 25:55.942
Hi. How are you?

25:55.942 --> 25:57.345
I am look...

25:57.345 --> 25:59.850
(gentle piano music playing,
quiet chatter)

26:05.127 --> 26:07.131
...hire who you want.

26:07.131 --> 26:10.270
Well, Roger, the job
offers complete autonomy.

26:10.270 --> 26:13.076
Would be your department
to run as you see fit.

26:13.076 --> 26:15.147
I hire who I want?

26:15.147 --> 26:17.284
HANCOCK: Of course.
You know better than we do

26:17.284 --> 26:19.923
who you want to
work with, right?

26:19.923 --> 26:21.159
Hey!

26:21.159 --> 26:22.829
Well, this is
unexpected.

26:22.829 --> 26:24.933
What are you
doing here, Riggs?

26:24.933 --> 26:26.369
Well, usually,
I come for the strudel.

26:26.369 --> 26:27.906
Because the strudel

26:27.906 --> 26:29.308
is delicious,

26:29.308 --> 26:31.112
but if you're about
to question a suspect,

26:31.112 --> 26:32.783
maybe a full meal.
How's the fish?

26:32.783 --> 26:34.185
There is no fish.

26:34.185 --> 26:37.324
And Mr. Hancock
is not a suspect.

26:37.324 --> 26:38.928
Mm.

26:38.928 --> 26:40.464
Anchovy. Anchovy's a fish,
is it not?

26:40.464 --> 26:41.934
MURTAUGH:
Riggs,

26:41.934 --> 26:43.270
you need to leave.

26:43.270 --> 26:44.873
Oh.

26:44.873 --> 26:46.209
Hold on. I lost my tooth.

26:46.209 --> 26:47.813
I think it's in the salad.

26:49.883 --> 26:51.386
Oh, this is, uh...
this is weird.

26:51.386 --> 26:53.123
Why don't you visit
with your friend

26:53.123 --> 26:55.227
and we'll talk later.
Yeah.

26:58.901 --> 27:01.039
You just ruined
my job interview.

27:01.039 --> 27:04.378
Coastal State wanted me
as their new head of security.

27:04.378 --> 27:05.982
Oh, seriously?

27:05.982 --> 27:07.986
You mean riding around
on a little golf cart?

27:07.986 --> 27:10.224
You would be awesome at that.
You'd hate it, though.

27:10.224 --> 27:12.929
No, you know why? Because I got
three kids going to college,

27:12.929 --> 27:14.332
a wife that's out of work,

27:14.332 --> 27:17.404
and a partner that just
makes my life miserable!

27:17.404 --> 27:19.075
Yeah, but you'd be working
for a murderer.

27:19.075 --> 27:20.745
Do I seriously
make your life miserable?

27:20.745 --> 27:23.951
So, you just decided
that Mr. Hancock is a murderer?

27:23.951 --> 27:24.953
Yeah, Rog.

27:24.953 --> 27:25.955
I just decided.

27:25.955 --> 27:27.124
I just pulled it out of the air.

27:27.124 --> 27:28.360
No. I followed him here.

27:28.360 --> 27:29.830
Okay? Not expecting
to see you.

27:29.830 --> 27:31.099
And guess what.

27:31.099 --> 27:32.368
This isn't his first meeting
tonight.

27:32.368 --> 27:33.971
He met with Benny Barnes
on the way here.

27:33.971 --> 27:35.975
Benny?
Yeah, Rog, Benny.

27:35.975 --> 27:37.846
Why would he want
to meet with Benny?

27:37.846 --> 27:39.382
I don't know. That's a really
good question, isn't it, Rog?

27:39.382 --> 27:40.552
And I'd love to delve into that,

27:40.552 --> 27:42.054
but first
I need to find my tooth.

27:44.893 --> 27:46.396
Oh.

27:46.396 --> 27:47.398
Eureka.

27:47.398 --> 27:48.534
Now,

27:48.534 --> 27:49.536
should we look at the entrees?

27:49.536 --> 27:50.738
Maybe get something to go?

27:58.320 --> 28:00.558
I had them wrap up
your salad to go

28:00.558 --> 28:03.096
after you stormed out
of the restaurant.

28:03.096 --> 28:05.434
You mean the salad that
your tooth fell into?

28:05.434 --> 28:08.741
I'm sorry, are you saying
you don't want the salad now?

28:14.118 --> 28:16.122
So, did you hear
from your buddy?

28:16.122 --> 28:17.424
Hancock?

28:17.424 --> 28:19.395
After you demolished
my interview?

28:19.395 --> 28:21.399
Look, I did you a favor.

28:21.399 --> 28:23.203
All right?
The guy's literally

28:23.203 --> 28:24.205
a murder suspect, Rog.

28:24.205 --> 28:26.543
For once...

28:26.543 --> 28:27.913
I had hope.

28:29.415 --> 28:31.887
A picture of a beautiful future.

28:31.887 --> 28:34.091
Oh, hey, look, a free dessert.

28:34.091 --> 28:36.429
Murtaugh, you
got a minute?

28:36.429 --> 28:38.935
I have all the time
in the world.

28:43.310 --> 28:45.314
Are you seriously
considering leaving

28:45.314 --> 28:47.051
to take this job at State?

28:47.051 --> 28:48.587
No. Where'd
you hear that?

28:48.587 --> 28:51.192
Riggs. It's not
gonna happen.

28:51.192 --> 28:53.330
Trish is gonna get another job,
you know that.

28:53.330 --> 28:55.334
It's‐‐ she's not just
gonna stop being Trish.

28:55.334 --> 28:57.071
I don't know that.

28:57.071 --> 28:59.275
She loves not working‐‐

28:59.275 --> 29:02.147
running charities,
German pancakes.

29:02.147 --> 29:03.416
You should see her.

29:03.416 --> 29:06.189
I mean, she looks great,
which I love, but...

29:06.189 --> 29:07.559
(sighs)

29:07.559 --> 29:09.462
It's not just Trish.
Riggs?

29:09.462 --> 29:11.165
I got something
on the Raines case:

her debt's paid in full.

29:22.589 --> 29:24.492
On a waitress salary.

29:24.492 --> 29:26.997
Okay, well, that's worth
another conversation with her.

29:26.997 --> 29:29.001

running into each other.

29:38.621 --> 29:39.956

29:39.956 --> 29:41.092
What are you, drunk?

29:41.092 --> 29:42.227
God, I wish.

29:42.227 --> 29:43.664
I'm on the wagon, Wally.

29:43.664 --> 29:46.637
My colleagues and I
have to get to a meeting.

29:46.637 --> 29:48.106
If you don't mind.

29:48.106 --> 29:49.643
Ooh, what's the meeting about?

29:49.643 --> 29:52.114
Is this about bribing recruits
or killing kids that get

29:52.114 --> 29:54.118
in the way of
bribing recruits?
Hey, look, this is harassment!

29:54.118 --> 29:56.322
I'm very good friends
with the police chief.

29:56.322 --> 29:57.391
I'm gonna give him a call.

29:57.391 --> 29:58.661
Oh, please, give him a call.

29:58.661 --> 30:00.263
Tell him that you hired

30:00.263 --> 30:02.267
Benny Barnes to kill
Steven Raines, right?

30:02.267 --> 30:04.338
And before you say,
"Who the heck is Benny?"

30:04.338 --> 30:07.010
I have got a phone
full of photos

30:07.010 --> 30:09.482
of you guys all cozy'd
up at the burger joint.

30:09.482 --> 30:12.287
Oh, this one
brings out your eyes.

30:12.287 --> 30:14.024
I've been friends
with Benny for years.

30:14.024 --> 30:15.293
The photos only prove it.

30:15.293 --> 30:17.064
Thought you might say that.
So, that's why

30:17.064 --> 30:18.701
we're getting a warrant
to go through Benny's accounts.

30:18.701 --> 30:21.105
And if we find one
payment from you‐‐

30:21.105 --> 30:24.378
and by the look on your face,
might have‐‐

30:24.378 --> 30:26.650
well, that's NCAA
rules violation and...

30:26.650 --> 30:28.386
I don't know, maybe
a first‐degree murder charge.

30:28.386 --> 30:30.190
Hey, any of you guys an
attorney, by any chance?

30:30.190 --> 30:31.727
Okay, okay, okay.

30:31.727 --> 30:35.200
Look, I wanted Jesse at State.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.070
His cousin
was getting in the way,

30:37.070 --> 30:38.641
so maybe I...

30:38.641 --> 30:41.479
asked Benny to persuade Steven
to get on board.

30:41.479 --> 30:42.682
Persuade?

30:42.682 --> 30:45.153
By persuade, you mean, like,
rough up and then shoot him?

30:45.153 --> 30:46.489
God, no.

30:46.489 --> 30:48.126
If Benny roughed Steven up,
or worse,

30:48.126 --> 30:49.361
that was his idea.

30:49.361 --> 30:51.299
And that money

30:51.299 --> 30:55.240
that I got to Benny,
that was for Jesse's family.

30:55.240 --> 30:56.777
They were
in a tough situation.

30:56.777 --> 30:58.681
I wanted to help out.

30:58.681 --> 31:00.250
His mother?

31:00.250 --> 31:02.054
The last thing
I would want to do

31:02.054 --> 31:04.659
is hurt anyone over a recruit.

31:04.659 --> 31:06.597
It might permanently
damage the program.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.470
Good point, Wally.

31:10.470 --> 31:13.276
Hey, Wally,
do me a favor.

31:13.276 --> 31:16.215
Stay the hell away
from my partner.

31:19.623 --> 31:21.492
Come on, Tanya!
Level with me.

31:21.492 --> 31:24.031
$20,000 bills just don't
pay themselves off.

31:24.031 --> 31:26.102
My aunt died.

31:26.102 --> 31:27.437
Money came from her.

31:27.437 --> 31:28.507
Generous. And
what's her name?

31:30.377 --> 31:32.114
I think you were taking payouts.

31:32.114 --> 31:35.120
All those schools' boosters
trying to get a piece of Jesse.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.659
Someone sent a taste your way?
Benny? Hancock?

31:37.659 --> 31:41.265
Those men were just looking out
for Jesse's best interests.

31:41.265 --> 31:43.537
And so was Steven,
and now he's dead!

31:43.537 --> 31:46.075
Steven was full of himself.

31:46.075 --> 31:49.148
Thinking he knew best what was
right for Jesse and me.

31:49.148 --> 31:51.152
Did Steven know you
were taking payouts?

31:51.152 --> 31:52.822
And he went to Benny?

31:52.822 --> 31:54.759
TANYA: I think
it's time that you left.

31:54.759 --> 31:56.495
And you got scared,

31:56.495 --> 31:58.701
because if Steven made trouble,
they'd stop paying you.

31:58.701 --> 31:59.703
Did you tell
any of those men

31:59.703 --> 32:01.439

were going to that night?

32:01.439 --> 32:03.009
Get out! Now!

32:06.583 --> 32:09.121
Yo, Rog. I figured it out.

32:09.121 --> 32:11.727
Benny and Hancock
were giving money...

32:11.727 --> 32:13.262
Jesse's mother. Yeah, I know.

32:13.262 --> 32:14.264
Yeah.

32:14.264 --> 32:16.335
Where were you?

32:16.335 --> 32:18.306
I went to go see Hancock.

32:18.306 --> 32:20.310
Yeah, you're not
gonna get that job.

You know who's car
made these tracks?

32:28.493 --> 32:31.165
You got three dollars?

That's his going rate
for cops, Rog.

That's Wendell's car.

32:42.320 --> 32:44.592
His ride's so low
that his muffler drags.

32:44.592 --> 32:45.861
And who's Wendell?

32:45.861 --> 32:47.464
Are you serious?

32:47.464 --> 32:50.236

run things around here.

when you first got here.

sense of smell?

32:56.148 --> 32:57.150
Yep.
All right.

also buys us a last name.

What did you do?

33:01.258 --> 33:02.427
He was family!

33:02.427 --> 33:04.699

of dollars to people...

You're supposed to be the
main one who's here for me.

33:07.705 --> 33:10.310
But you just ruined my
life and took Steven's.

33:10.310 --> 33:12.180
Why? Because he
got in the way?

33:12.180 --> 33:14.451

taken that other job?

because I'm not working?

39:05.052 --> 39:06.421
Be honest.

39:06.421 --> 39:07.824
RIANA:
I knew it.

39:07.824 --> 39:09.562
We have to move, don't we?

39:09.562 --> 39:10.697
Dad didn't get the job.

39:10.697 --> 39:12.433

with my résumé
tied behind my back.

39:13.836 --> 39:15.005
Mm‐hmm.
Riana calm down.

39:15.005 --> 39:17.443
I only quit less than a
week ago. We're not moving.

39:17.443 --> 39:20.684
And even if we were,
that wouldn't matter.

39:20.684 --> 39:21.786
Not to you.

39:21.786 --> 39:23.790
I don't want to
share a room with RJ.

39:23.790 --> 39:25.594
Okay, listen. A big
house and nice things

39:25.594 --> 39:27.798

happy in this life.
