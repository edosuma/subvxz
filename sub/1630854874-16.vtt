00:32.135 --> 00:32.700
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:32.769 --> 00:34.035
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:34.104 --> 00:34.735
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:34.804 --> 00:35.403
US.

00:35.472 --> 00:36.737
IT HAS BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:36.806 --> 00:39.474
ISRAEL CONTINUED TO REJECT CALLS

00:39.543 --> 00:40.775
FOR EVEN A HUMANITARIAN PAUSE

00:40.844 --> 00:42.510
UNTIL ITS HOSTAGES ARE RETURNED,

00:42.579 --> 00:43.578
WHILE ITS RELENTLESS BOMBING OF

00:43.647 --> 00:44.846
GAZA HIT BOTH A REFUGEE CAMP AND

00:44.915 --> 00:46.581
AN AMBULANCE.

00:46.650 --> 00:47.849
MEANWHILE HERE IN THE U.S.,

00:47.918 --> 00:49.083
SAM BANKMAN-FRIED WAS FOUND

00:49.152 --> 00:50.518
GUILTY ON SEVEN COUNTS OF FRAUD

00:50.587 --> 00:52.220
AND CONSPIRACY, AND RON DESANTIS

00:52.289 --> 00:53.488
CONTINUED TO BE DOGGED BY

00:53.557 --> 00:56.090
ALLEGATIONS THAT HE WEARS LIFTS

00:56.159 --> 00:59.460
IN HIS BOOTS, SOMETHING THAT

00:59.529 --> 01:00.261
PROMPTED THIS ACTUAL POLITICO

01:00.330 --> 01:01.796
HEADLINE, "3 EXPERT SHOEMAKERS

01:01.865 --> 01:02.730
SAY RON DESANTIS IS PROBABLY

01:02.799 --> 01:05.066
WEARING HEIGHT BOOSTERS," AND

01:05.135 --> 01:06.200
DONALD TRUMP TO SHARE AN IMAGE

01:06.269 --> 01:07.335
CAPTIONED "TELL ME HE'S NOT

01:07.404 --> 01:10.037
WEARING HIDDEN HEELS."

01:10.106 --> 01:11.072
WELL, THIS WEEK, DESANTIS

01:11.141 --> 01:12.406
RESPONDED TO THAT WITH HIS

01:12.475 --> 01:13.674
TRADEMARK WIT.

01:13.743 --> 01:15.009
>> I KNOW DONALD TRUMP AND A LOT

01:15.078 --> 01:16.744
OF HIS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING

01:16.813 --> 01:18.312
ON THINGS LIKE FOOTWEAR.

01:18.381 --> 01:20.348
I'LL TELL YOU THIS.

01:20.417 --> 01:21.215
YOU KNOW, IF DONALD TRUMP CAN

01:21.284 --> 01:22.350
SUMMON THE BALLS TO SHOW UP TO

01:22.419 --> 01:23.718
THE DEBATE, I'LL WEAR A BOOT ON

01:23.787 --> 01:25.520
MY HEAD.

01:25.589 --> 01:27.155
THIS IS A TIME FOR SUBSTANCE.

01:27.224 --> 01:28.589
>> John: WHAT?

01:28.658 --> 01:30.224
OKAY, FIRST, YOU CAN'T CLAIM

01:30.293 --> 01:31.926
IT'S A TIME FOR SUBSTANCE JUST

01:31.995 --> 01:33.294
AFTER PROMISING TO WEAR A BOOT

01:33.363 --> 01:34.529
ON YOUR HEAD.

01:34.598 --> 01:35.530
BUT SECOND, YOU'RE SO BAD AT

01:35.599 --> 01:36.497
THIS.

01:36.566 --> 01:37.598
EVEN IF YOU WEREN'T RUNNING

01:37.667 --> 01:39.967
AGAINST ONE OF THE WORLD'S

01:40.036 --> 01:41.102
GREATEST BULLIES, IT LOOKS SO

01:41.171 --> 01:42.270
PATHETIC THAT YOU THOUGHT THAT

01:42.339 --> 01:43.938
WAS A GOOD COMEBACK.

01:44.007 --> 01:45.640
NEVER BEFORE HAS A POLITICIAN

01:45.709 --> 01:47.642
HAD SUCH "KID WITH THE ROLLING

01:50.514 --> 01:51.679
AND LOOK, THERE'LL BE PLENTY OF

01:51.748 --> 01:53.548
TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE 2024

01:53.617 --> 01:55.616
ELECTIONS, IN 2024.

01:55.685 --> 01:56.784
BUT WE'RE GOING TO DIVE STRAIGHT

01:56.853 --> 01:57.585
IN TO OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT,

01:57.654 --> 01:58.619
WHICH CONCERNS THE ELECTIONS

01:58.688 --> 01:59.921
HAPPENING AROUND THE COUNTRY IN

01:59.990 --> 02:01.489
TWO DAYS.

02:01.558 --> 02:02.757
THERE'S THE USUAL BARRAGE OF

02:02.826 --> 02:04.425
NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN ADS HAPPENING

02:04.494 --> 02:06.394
RIGHT NOW, PERHAPS NONE MORE

02:06.463 --> 02:13.067
MEMORABLE THAN THIS ONE, IN A

02:13.136 --> 02:13.568
PENNSYLVANIA D.A. RACE.

02:13.637 --> 02:14.001
>> YOU'VE SEEN THOSE

02:14.070 --> 02:14.602
MOTIVATIONAL SIGNS PEOPLE HAVE

02:14.671 --> 02:15.002
IN THEIR OFFICES?

02:15.071 --> 02:16.304
MATT DUGAN'S OFFICE HAD A SIGN,

02:16.373 --> 02:17.472
TOO.

02:17.541 --> 02:19.006
AS REPORTED BY KDKA ANNOUNCER,

02:19.075 --> 02:21.843
IT READS: "[BLEEP] THE POLICE."

02:21.912 --> 02:24.278
>> John: WOW.

02:24.347 --> 02:25.480
THAT IS A STRIKING AD.

02:25.549 --> 02:27.048
NOW, DUGAN'S PUSHED BACK ON

02:27.117 --> 02:28.349
THAT, SAYING THAT'S NOT HIS

02:28.418 --> 02:29.350
OFFICE, IT BELONGED TO A

02:29.419 --> 02:33.821
DIFFERENT ATTORNEY.

02:33.890 --> 02:34.422
BUT IF SO, I NOW WANT TO KNOW

02:34.491 --> 02:35.022
EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM INSTEAD,

02:35.091 --> 02:36.057
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE THE ONLY

02:36.126 --> 02:37.725
PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO HAS A

02:37.794 --> 02:39.160
"FUCK THE POLICE" SIGN NEXT TO A

02:39.229 --> 02:39.794
BOBBLEHEAD OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE

02:39.863 --> 02:41.829
JAMES MADISON.

02:41.898 --> 02:44.599
NOT JUST THAT, THAT'S NEXT TO A

02:44.668 --> 02:46.100
STATUE OF AUDREY II FROM

02:46.169 --> 02:48.202
"LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS," WHO IN

02:48.271 --> 02:49.670
TURN IS NEXT TO A BOBBLEHEAD OF

02:49.739 --> 02:50.138
TEDDY ROOSEVELT.

02:50.207 --> 02:51.672
THOSE ARE NOT USUALLY SHARED

02:51.741 --> 02:53.608
INTERESTS.

02:53.677 --> 02:54.509
THAT FASCINATING INDIVIDUAL

02:54.578 --> 02:57.845
CONTAINS MULTITUDES.

02:57.914 --> 03:01.048
BUT WHILE SOME LOCAL RACES ARE

03:01.117 --> 03:01.716
UNDERSTANDABLY FOCUSED ON "LIVE,

03:01.785 --> 03:03.718
LAUGH, FUCK THE POLICE" OFFICE

03:03.787 --> 03:04.318
SIGNAGE, MANY OTHERS WILL BE

03:04.387 --> 03:05.753
FOCUSED ON REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS.

03:05.822 --> 03:07.789
ABORTION IS A HUGE ISSUE IN THE

03:07.858 --> 03:08.990
KENTUCKY GOVERNOR'S RACE, AND

03:09.059 --> 03:09.957
THE RACE TO CONTROL VIRGINIA'S

03:10.026 --> 03:11.125
STATE SENATE.

03:11.194 --> 03:12.827
AND IN OHIO, THERE'S AN

03:12.896 --> 03:14.462
AMENDMENT ON THE BALLOT TO

03:14.531 --> 03:15.830
ENSHRINE THE RIGHT TO ABORTION

03:15.899 --> 03:17.632
IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION.

03:17.701 --> 03:18.332
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

03:18.401 --> 03:20.067
ABORTION.

03:20.136 --> 03:21.502
AS YOU KNOW, 16 MONTHS AGO, THE

03:21.571 --> 03:23.171
SUPREME COURT'S DOBBS DECISION

03:23.240 --> 03:26.207
OVERTURNED ROE V. WADE.

03:26.276 --> 03:26.808
AND SINCE THEN IT MAY'VE BEEN

03:26.877 --> 03:28.676
TEMPTING -- ESPECIALLY IF YOU

03:28.745 --> 03:29.277
LIVE IN A STATE UNIMPACTED BY

03:29.346 --> 03:30.411
THE DOBBS RULING -- TO AVOID

03:30.480 --> 03:31.813
WATCHING THE FALLOUT FROM IT TOO

03:31.882 --> 03:32.447
CLOSELY, KNOWING HOW DEPRESSING

03:32.516 --> 03:35.016
IT'D BE.

03:35.085 --> 03:35.616
AND I'LL BE HONEST, THINGS ARE

03:35.685 --> 03:37.151
BLEAK.

03:37.220 --> 03:38.252
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND

03:38.321 --> 03:42.490
EXACTLY HOW BLEAK.

03:42.559 --> 03:43.024
CURRENTLY, 14 STATES HAVE

03:43.093 --> 03:43.658
ENACTED NEAR TOTAL ABORTION BANS

03:43.727 --> 03:45.092
AND TWO HAVE IMPOSED SIX-WEEK

03:45.161 --> 03:47.161
LIMITS.

03:47.230 --> 03:48.029
AND THOSE BANS HAVE PROMPTED

03:48.098 --> 03:49.430
MANY TO DESPERATELY TRY TO

03:49.499 --> 03:51.432
MAINTAIN ABORTION ACCESS FOR

03:51.501 --> 03:53.267
THOSE WHO NEED IT, AND SOMETIMES

03:53.336 --> 03:55.103
IN TRULY IMAGINATIVE WAYS.

03:55.172 --> 03:57.205
>> A CALIFORNIA DOCTOR IS

03:57.274 --> 03:58.773
PROPOSING A FLOATING ABORTION

03:58.842 --> 04:00.074
CLINIC AS A WAY TO BYPASS LAWS

04:00.143 --> 04:01.542
IN SOME STATES THAT ARE

04:01.611 --> 04:03.211
RESTRICTING THE PROCEDURE.

04:03.280 --> 04:04.545
SHE SAYS THE CLINIC WOULD

04:04.614 --> 04:05.780
OPERATE ON A BOAT FLOATING IN

04:05.849 --> 04:07.748
FEDERAL WATERS JUST OFF THE GULF

04:07.817 --> 04:09.050
OF MEXICO, SO TECHNICALLY MAKING

04:09.119 --> 04:11.552
IT OUT OF REACH TO ANY STATE

04:11.621 --> 04:12.987
LAWS HERE.

04:13.056 --> 04:14.455
>> John: WOW, LAWLESS TERRITORY,

04:14.524 --> 04:16.557
NO RULES, ANYTHING GOES.

04:16.626 --> 04:18.326
IT'S NOT ONLY A FOOLPROOF PLAN,

04:18.395 --> 04:20.895
IT'S ALSO THE PREMISE FOR THE

04:20.964 --> 04:21.963
MOVIE "MONEY PLANE."

04:22.032 --> 04:23.431
NO, YOU DIDN'T HALLUCINATE THAT

04:23.500 --> 04:24.532
DURING PEAK COVID.

04:24.601 --> 04:25.833
THERE REALLY WAS A FILM ABOUT A

04:25.902 --> 04:27.368
CASINO IN THE SKY FULL OF

04:27.437 --> 04:28.402
THIEVES, CARTELS, AND ARMS

04:28.471 --> 04:29.370
DEALERS, WHO CAN NEVER BE

04:29.439 --> 04:30.338
ARRESTED BECAUSE THE MONEY PLANE

04:30.407 --> 04:31.372
IS ALWAYS MOVING IN

04:31.441 --> 04:32.607
INTERNATIONAL AIRSPACE.

04:32.676 --> 04:33.841
IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, YOU

04:33.910 --> 04:35.009
SHOULD FRANKLY STOP WATCHING

04:35.078 --> 04:36.611
THIS SHOW RIGHT NOW, AND GO

04:36.680 --> 04:38.012
WATCH THAT INSTEAD.

04:38.081 --> 04:39.881
IF YOU POP AN EDIBLE

04:39.950 --> 04:42.917
IMMEDIATELY, IT SHOULD START TO

04:42.986 --> 04:43.785
KICK IN RIGHT AROUND WHEN YOU

04:43.854 --> 04:45.319
MEET THE FILM'S VILLAIN, DARIUS

04:45.388 --> 04:47.021
EMMANUEL GROUCH THE THIRD,

04:47.090 --> 04:48.923
A.K.A. "THE RUMBLE," PLAYED BY

04:48.992 --> 04:50.191
KELSEY GRAMMER, AND HE EXPLAINS

04:50.260 --> 04:52.894
THE "MONEY PLANE" LIKE THIS.

04:52.963 --> 04:53.928
>> WHATEVER YOU WANT TO WAGER

04:53.997 --> 04:54.529
ON, THE "MONEY PLANE" HAS YOU

04:54.598 --> 04:55.429
COVERED.

04:55.498 --> 04:56.397
YOU WANNA BET ON A DUDE FUCKING

04:56.466 --> 04:57.832
AN ALLIGATOR?

04:57.901 --> 04:59.233
"MONEY PLANE."

04:59.302 --> 05:04.005
>> John: YEAH.

05:04.074 --> 05:04.505
FUCKING YES.

05:04.574 --> 05:04.939
THAT MOVIE IS REAL.

05:05.008 --> 05:06.941
IT'S THE "FRASIER" REBOOT WE

05:07.010 --> 05:08.075
DESERVED.

05:08.144 --> 05:09.877
ANYWAY, BACK TO ABORTION.

05:09.946 --> 05:11.379
THE DOBBS DECISION CAUSED

05:11.448 --> 05:13.014
IMMEDIATE CONFUSION AND PANIC.

05:13.083 --> 05:13.815
ESPECIALLY IN STATES THAT HAD

05:13.884 --> 05:15.650
"TRIGGER LAWS" ALREADY ON THE

05:15.719 --> 05:17.151
BOOKS, WHICH KICKED IN ALMOST

05:17.220 --> 05:22.056
IMMEDIATELY, CAUSING CHAOS FOR

05:22.125 --> 05:22.590
BOTH PATIENTS AND ABORTION

05:22.659 --> 05:22.857
PROVIDERS.

05:22.926 --> 05:23.591
>> AS SOON AS WE HEARD THE

05:23.660 --> 05:26.461
DECISION, WE CLOSED EVERYTHING

05:26.530 --> 05:27.995
DOWN, LEAVING OVER 70 WOMEN IN

05:28.064 --> 05:30.264
WISCONSIN WITH APPOINTMENTS THAT

05:30.333 --> 05:32.233
WE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO FOR THEM.

05:32.302 --> 05:34.502
>> I REMEMBER ASKING, "WHEN IS

05:34.571 --> 05:35.570
THE LAW GONNA CHANGE?

05:35.639 --> 05:36.304
HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE TO GET

05:36.373 --> 05:38.206
READY FOR IT?"

05:38.275 --> 05:39.807
AND THEY STARTED TO TEXT BACK

05:39.876 --> 05:40.441
AND SAY, "THE LAW HAS ACTUALLY

05:40.510 --> 05:40.875
CHANGED RIGHT NOW."

05:40.944 --> 05:42.076
>> YOU KNOW, WE CALLED PATIENTS,

05:42.145 --> 05:42.944
IT'S, LIKE, I'M ALREADY ON MY

05:43.013 --> 05:45.446
WAY.

05:45.515 --> 05:46.881
AND THEY THOUGHT, WELL, I'M

05:46.950 --> 05:47.815
ALREADY ON MY WAY.

05:47.884 --> 05:48.683
IT'LL BE OKAY.

05:48.752 --> 05:50.118
AND IT'S, LIKE, NO, IT'S

05:50.187 --> 05:50.651
IMMEDIATE.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.386
IT'S IMMEDIATE.

05:52.455 --> 05:53.554
>> John: LOOK, SOMEONE CANCELING

05:53.623 --> 05:54.822
PLANS WHEN YOU'RE ALREADY ON

05:54.891 --> 05:55.990
YOUR WAY IS ANNOYING IN ANY

05:56.059 --> 05:57.692
CIRCUMSTANCE, BUT IT'S DIFFERENT

05:57.761 --> 05:59.494
WHEN THAT PLAN IS AN ABORTION.

05:59.563 --> 06:01.395
IF DINNER PLANS FALL THROUGH,

06:01.464 --> 06:02.730
THAT'S A BUMMER, BUT AT LEAST IT

06:02.799 --> 06:03.898
WON'T END WITH SOMETHING

06:03.967 --> 06:04.932
ALIEN-ING OUT OF YOUR BODY.

06:05.001 --> 06:06.234
UNLESS, THAT IS, YOU RESCHEDULE

06:06.303 --> 06:07.401
THAT DINNER TO LONG JOHN

06:07.470 --> 06:09.370
SILVER'S.

06:09.439 --> 06:11.806
NOW, THANKFULLY, ABORTION

06:11.875 --> 06:13.741
REMAINS LEGAL IN MANY STATES, SO

06:13.810 --> 06:15.276
AT LEAST THEORETICALLY, SOMEONE

06:15.345 --> 06:16.878
NEEDING ONE CAN TRAVEL TO ONE OF

06:16.947 --> 06:18.446
THOSE STATES INSTEAD.

06:18.515 --> 06:19.847
BUT AS THIS DOCTOR POINTS OUT,

06:19.916 --> 06:20.381
IN PRACTICE, THAT CAN BE

06:20.450 --> 06:22.984
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT.

06:23.053 --> 06:24.318
>> WE HAVE SUCH INEQUALITY THAT,

06:24.387 --> 06:26.721
FOR SOME, IT'S AS EASY AS, OKAY,

06:26.790 --> 06:29.056
LET'S TAKE A WEEKEND TRIP TO

06:29.125 --> 06:29.657
COLORADO TO GET YOUR ABORTION.

06:29.726 --> 06:30.691
AND FOR SOMEONE ELSE, IT'S A

06:30.760 --> 06:32.059
COMPLETELY LIFE-ALTERING THING

06:32.128 --> 06:34.929
THAT YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER,

06:34.998 --> 06:36.998
AND YOU'RE FORCED TO GIVE BIRTH.

06:37.067 --> 06:37.732
THE TRAJECTORY OF THOSE TWO

06:37.801 --> 06:38.666
PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE COMPLETELY

06:38.735 --> 06:40.268
DIFFERENT.

06:40.337 --> 06:40.701
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

06:40.770 --> 06:42.003
FOR MANY, TRAVELING ACROSS STATE

06:42.072 --> 06:44.772
LINES ISN'T FEASIBLE -- EVEN

06:44.841 --> 06:45.440
BEFORE YOU CONSIDER THAT, IN

06:45.509 --> 06:46.808
STATES WHERE ABORTION REMAINS

06:46.877 --> 06:48.242
LEGAL, IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'VE HAD

06:48.311 --> 06:49.944
A SUDDEN SURGE IN PROVIDERS TO

06:50.013 --> 06:51.779
HANDLE OUT-OF-STATE PATIENTS.

06:51.848 --> 06:53.481
SO THERE ARE NOW SIGNIFICANT

06:53.550 --> 06:54.982
BACKLOGS, MEANING THAT WOMEN WHO

06:55.051 --> 06:56.651
TRAVEL TO ANOTHER STATE MAY HAVE

06:56.720 --> 06:58.319
MORE DIFFICULTY GETTING

06:58.388 --> 06:59.754
APPOINTMENTS, AND IT MAY EVEN

06:59.823 --> 07:01.689
BECOME HARD FOR THOSE LIVING IN

07:01.758 --> 07:03.024
SOME STATES WHERE IT REMAINS

07:03.093 --> 07:04.258
LEGAL.

07:04.327 --> 07:05.660
WHICH CLEARLY ISN'T GREAT!

07:05.729 --> 07:06.861
ABORTION ISN'T ONE OF THOSE

07:06.930 --> 07:08.396
THINGS YOU CAN KEEP PUTTING OFF

07:08.465 --> 07:09.697
INDEFINITELY, LIKE TAKING UP

07:09.766 --> 07:11.599
POTTERY OR FIGURING OUT WHO

07:11.668 --> 07:12.667
THESE GUYS ARE AND WHY THEY'RE

07:12.736 --> 07:13.768
LIKE THAT.

07:13.837 --> 07:14.769
I SAY THIS WITH ZERO MALICE, BY

07:14.838 --> 07:15.236
THE WAY.

07:15.305 --> 07:16.137
THEY SEEM VERY WHOLESOME.

07:16.206 --> 07:17.338
I JUST DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND

07:17.407 --> 07:18.539
WHAT THEIR WHOLE DEAL IS.

07:18.608 --> 07:20.141
I AM GONNA GET AROUND TO IT, BUT

07:20.210 --> 07:20.641
TO BE HONEST, IT'S NOT A

07:20.710 --> 07:22.977
PRIORITY.

07:23.046 --> 07:23.511
AND SOME ARE RESORTING TO

07:23.580 --> 07:25.813
DRASTIC MEASURES.

07:25.882 --> 07:26.514
LISTEN TO THIS WOMAN WHO DID

07:26.583 --> 07:28.449
MANAGE TO GET ACROSS STATE LINES

07:28.518 --> 07:30.051
TO NEW MEXICO FOR AN ABORTION,

07:30.120 --> 07:32.320
DESCRIBE WHAT'S HAPPENED TO HER

07:32.389 --> 07:33.688
FRIENDS WHO WEREN'T ABLE TO.

07:33.757 --> 07:34.989
>> WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IF

07:35.058 --> 07:35.990
YOU COULDN'T COME TO NEW MEXICO

07:36.059 --> 07:37.558
FOR AN ABORTION?

07:37.627 --> 07:39.827
>> GOD, WHO KNOWS?

07:39.896 --> 07:41.596
'CAUSE I WAS ALREADY ASKING

07:41.665 --> 07:42.663
PEOPLE LIKE, HEY, WHAT COULD I

07:42.732 --> 07:45.366
DO?

07:45.435 --> 07:47.835
I'VE KNOWN SOME WOMEN TO JUST

07:47.904 --> 07:49.403
KIND OF TAKE IT INTO THEIR OWN

07:49.472 --> 07:51.205
HANDS AND DO, LIKE, THEIR OWN

07:51.274 --> 07:52.173
ABORTION.

07:52.242 --> 07:54.041
LIKE I HAD A FRIEND TELL ME SHE

07:54.110 --> 07:56.244
DRANK A CAP OF BLEACH, YOU KNOW?

07:56.313 --> 07:58.212
I HAD ANOTHER WOMAN TELL ME,

07:58.281 --> 07:59.580
GIRL, LIKE JUST TAKE A WHOLE

07:59.649 --> 08:01.883
BUNCH OF VITAMIN C.

08:01.952 --> 08:03.518
>> John: LISTEN, THERE ARE A LOT

08:03.587 --> 08:04.886
OF VERY GOOD SECRET TIPS THAT

08:04.955 --> 08:06.454
WOMEN RIGHTLY SHARE WITH EACH

08:06.523 --> 08:08.289
OTHER LIKE, "BANANAS ARE GOOD

08:08.358 --> 08:09.757
FOR CRAMPS" OR "LIPSTICK WORKS

08:09.826 --> 08:12.393
AS BLUSH IN A PINCH" OR "BLOCK

08:12.462 --> 08:14.328
COACH BRETT FROM YOUR INSTAGRAM

08:14.397 --> 08:14.595
STORIES."

08:14.664 --> 08:16.197
BUT "DRINK BLEACH OR VITAMIN C

08:16.266 --> 08:17.598
TO END A PREGNANCY" IS NOT ONE

08:17.667 --> 08:18.299
OF THEM.

08:18.368 --> 08:19.500
AND UNFORTUNATELY, DANGEROUS

08:19.569 --> 08:20.935
MEASURES LIKE THOSE MAY NOW

08:21.004 --> 08:22.603
BECOME MORE COMMON, AS

08:22.672 --> 08:23.771
ANTI-ABORTION ACTIVISTS HAVE NO

08:23.840 --> 08:25.740
INTENTION OF STOPPING THEIR PUSH

08:25.809 --> 08:26.941
FOR RESTRICTIONS.

08:27.010 --> 08:28.042
FOR EXAMPLE, THEY'RE ALSO GOING

08:28.111 --> 08:29.710
AFTER MEDICATION ABORTIONS,

08:29.779 --> 08:30.411
WHICH ARE ESTIMATED TO MAKE UP

08:30.480 --> 08:32.613
HALF OF ALL ABORTIONS.

08:32.682 --> 08:34.081
A LAWSUIT TO REVOKE THE FDA'S

08:34.150 --> 08:35.550
APPROVAL OF MIFEPRISTONE -- ONE

08:35.619 --> 08:37.051
OF TWO KEY DRUGS IN MEDICATION

08:37.120 --> 08:38.519
ABORTIONS -- IS CURRENTLY

08:38.588 --> 08:39.954
WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE

08:40.023 --> 08:41.255
COURTS.

08:41.324 --> 08:42.056
AND IF THAT WERE TO SUCCEED, IT

08:42.125 --> 08:43.458
WOULDN'T JUST IMPACT STATES WITH

08:43.527 --> 08:44.492
ABORTION BANS, IT WOULD AFFECT

08:44.561 --> 08:45.760
ACCESS ACROSS THE ENTIRE

08:45.829 --> 08:48.062
COUNTRY.

08:48.131 --> 08:49.297
SO, ABORTION LAW IN AMERICA IS

08:49.366 --> 08:49.730
CURRENTLY A COMPLETE

08:49.799 --> 08:50.364
CLUSTERFUCK, WITH MANY CONFUSED,

08:50.433 --> 08:52.033
AND OTHERS CONSIDERING DRINKING

08:52.102 --> 08:53.968
BLEACH.

08:54.037 --> 08:55.937
AND YET, THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE

08:56.006 --> 08:58.239
AND PASSED THESE LAWS, LIKE THIS

08:58.308 --> 08:58.806
TEXAS STATE LEGISLATOR, WILL

08:58.875 --> 09:00.441
INSIST IT'S ALL WORTH IT, BASED

09:00.510 --> 09:03.344
ON WHO, PRECISELY AND

09:03.413 --> 09:04.979
EXCLUSIVELY, THEY PROTECT.

09:05.048 --> 09:05.580
>> THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND

09:05.649 --> 09:07.782
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD

09:07.851 --> 09:09.317
HAVE CHOSEN TO HAVE AN ABORTION

09:09.386 --> 09:10.585
NOW DON'T HAVE THAT CHOICE.

09:10.654 --> 09:11.552
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

09:11.621 --> 09:12.120
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE

09:12.189 --> 09:12.720
PEOPLE?

09:12.789 --> 09:13.454
>> THOSE ARE THOUSANDS AND

09:13.523 --> 09:14.889
THOUSANDS OF LITTLE BABIES THAT

09:14.958 --> 09:17.258
ARE NOW ALIVE.

09:17.327 --> 09:18.025
WE ARE A VERY SAFE PLACE FOR

09:18.094 --> 09:19.460
LITTLE BABIES.

09:19.529 --> 09:21.129
>> WHAT ABOUT WOMEN?

09:21.198 --> 09:22.964
>> WE ARE VERY SAFE SPACE FOR

09:23.033 --> 09:24.932
LITTLE -- FOR WOMEN AS WELL.

09:25.001 --> 09:26.834
>> John: OOPS, NEARLY SAID THE

09:26.903 --> 09:27.668
QUIET PART OUT LOUD THERE,

09:27.737 --> 09:28.970
DIDN'T WE?

09:29.039 --> 09:30.338
ALSO, IT'S A PRETTY SAD STATE OF

09:30.407 --> 09:31.639
AFFAIRS WHEN "BUT WHAT ABOUT

09:31.708 --> 09:32.673
WOMEN?"

09:32.742 --> 09:33.775
GENUINELY COUNTS AS A GOTCHA

09:33.844 --> 09:35.743
QUESTION.

09:35.812 --> 09:37.311
BECAUSE FOR THE RECORD: ABORTION

09:37.380 --> 09:38.913
BANS ARE, OBJECTIVELY, NOT SAFE

09:38.982 --> 09:40.081
FOR WOMEN, AND CAN NEEDLESSLY

09:40.150 --> 09:42.950
PUT THEM THROUGH HELL.

09:43.019 --> 09:44.552
TAKE WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS WOMAN

09:44.621 --> 09:46.087
IN TEXAS, WHOSE ULTRASOUND NOT

09:46.156 --> 09:47.488
ONLY REVEALED NO CHANCE OF

09:47.557 --> 09:50.391
SURVIVAL FOR THE FETUS, BUT ALSO

09:50.460 --> 09:50.958
POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING

09:51.027 --> 09:52.126
COMPLICATIONS FOR HER.

09:52.195 --> 09:54.328
>> KAILEE'S DOCTOR WAS CLEAR.

09:54.397 --> 09:55.263
>> WHEN HE'S BORN, HE'S GOING TO

09:55.332 --> 09:56.664
SUFFOCATE TO DEATH.

09:56.733 --> 09:58.366
HE MAY LIVE FOR A FEW MINUTES,

09:58.435 --> 09:59.100
HE MAY LIVE FOR AN HOUR, BUT

09:59.169 --> 10:01.035
HE'S GOING TO DIE.

10:01.104 --> 10:03.371
>> HER DOCTORS SAID THEY COULD

10:03.440 --> 10:04.205
NOT PERFORM AN ABORTION, NOTING

10:04.274 --> 10:05.773
IN HER RECORDS, "TERMINATION IS

10:05.842 --> 10:06.307
NOT LEGAL IN THE STATE OF

10:06.376 --> 10:07.241
TEXAS."

10:07.310 --> 10:09.777
>> HOW COULD YOU BE SO CRUEL AS

10:09.846 --> 10:11.879
TO PASS A LAW THAT YOU KNOW WILL

10:11.948 --> 10:14.482
HURT WOMEN AND THAT YOU KNOW

10:14.551 --> 10:16.784
WILL CAUSE BABIES TO BE BORN IN

10:16.853 --> 10:17.685
PAIN?

10:17.754 --> 10:19.253
HE WAS GOING TO DIE A PAINFUL

10:19.322 --> 10:21.055
DEATH.

10:21.124 --> 10:21.889
SO HOW IS THAT HUMANE?

10:21.958 --> 10:24.292
HOW IS THAT SAVING ANYBODY?

10:24.361 --> 10:25.893
>> THEY DESPERATELY WANT TO HAVE

10:25.962 --> 10:27.061
ANOTHER BABY, BUT THERE'S A HIGH

10:27.130 --> 10:29.831
LIKELIHOOD SOMETHING WILL GO

10:29.900 --> 10:30.798
WRONG AGAIN.

10:30.867 --> 10:31.999
>> THE LAST TIME I SAW MY OB,

10:32.068 --> 10:33.267
SHE SAID, "DO NOT GET PREGNANT

10:33.336 --> 10:34.936
IN TEXAS RIGHT NOW."

10:35.005 --> 10:36.571
>> John: WOW.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.239
THAT'S NOT ONLY DEVASTATING, IT

10:38.308 --> 10:40.208
IS A TRULY HORRIBLE THING TO

10:40.277 --> 10:41.008
HAVE TO ADD TO THE LIST OF

10:41.077 --> 10:41.742
THINGS PREGNANT WOMEN ARE NOT

10:41.811 --> 10:43.177
SAFE TO DO.

10:43.246 --> 10:44.512
SO IT'S NOW OFFICIALLY: RIDE A

10:44.581 --> 10:45.746
ROLLERCOASTER, EAT SUSHI, DYE

10:45.815 --> 10:47.181
YOUR ROOTS, AND SIMPLY "EXIST IN

10:47.250 --> 10:50.184
THE STATE OF TEXAS."

10:50.253 --> 10:51.385
MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ARE NOW

10:51.454 --> 10:52.653
FINDING THEMSELVES CAUGHT IN THE

10:52.722 --> 10:53.855
MIDDLE BETWEEN TRYING TO DO WHAT

10:53.924 --> 10:55.189
THEY KNOW IS MEDICALLY RIGHT FOR

10:55.258 --> 10:56.891
THEIR PATIENTS WHILE ALSO NOT

10:56.960 --> 10:58.059
RUNNING AFOUL OF THE LAW, OR

10:58.128 --> 10:59.527
HAVING THEIR LICENSE REVOKED.

10:59.596 --> 11:01.129
ONE DOCTOR SAID HER COLLEAGUES

11:01.198 --> 11:02.630
WERE SO UNSURE OF WHETHER OR NOT

11:02.699 --> 11:04.098
THEY COULD LEGALLY RECOMMEND

11:04.167 --> 11:06.067
THEIR PATIENTS SEEK ABORTIONS

11:06.136 --> 11:07.535
ELSEWHERE THAT THEY RESORTED TO

11:07.604 --> 11:08.035
SAYING THINGS LIKE "THE

11:08.104 --> 11:09.270
WEATHER'S REALLY NICE IN NEW

11:09.339 --> 11:10.638
MEXICO RIGHT NOW.

11:10.707 --> 11:12.173
YOU SHOULD GO CHECK IT OUT."

11:12.242 --> 11:13.307
OR, "I'VE HEARD TRAVELING TO

11:13.376 --> 11:15.243
COLORADO IS REALLY NICE THIS

11:15.312 --> 11:17.044
TIME OF YEAR."

11:17.113 --> 11:17.945
WHICH ISN'T JUST ABSURD, I'M NOT

11:18.014 --> 11:19.080
EVEN SURE THOSE ARE EFFECTIVE

11:19.149 --> 11:20.548
HINTS.

11:20.617 --> 11:22.150
NEW MEXICO AND COLORADO ARE TWO

11:22.219 --> 11:24.152
OF THE MOST OBJECTIVELY

11:24.221 --> 11:25.753
BEAUTIFUL STATES IN THE NATION.

11:25.822 --> 11:27.088
THAT COULD JUST BE A NICE

11:27.157 --> 11:28.389
VACATION TIP.

11:28.458 --> 11:30.024
NOW, IF THE DOCTORS WERE

11:30.093 --> 11:31.492
RECOMMENDING VISITING NEWARK OR

11:31.561 --> 11:33.094
NEW JERSEY, OR SAYING, "I'VE

11:33.163 --> 11:33.861
HEARD BUFFALO'S NICE THIS TIME

11:33.930 --> 11:35.029
OF YEAR," THEN SURE, YOU'D KNOW

11:35.098 --> 11:36.931
SOMETHING ELSE WAS CLEARLY BEING

11:37.000 --> 11:38.800
COMMUNICATED.

11:38.869 --> 11:40.034
AND WHILE YOU MIGHT THINK

11:40.103 --> 11:41.335
DOCTORS FACING EMERGENCY

11:41.404 --> 11:42.870
SITUATIONS SHOULD SIMPLY TAKE IT

11:42.939 --> 11:44.505
UPON THEMSELVES TO QUIETLY

11:44.574 --> 11:46.407
PERFORM ABORTIONS ANYWAY, AS

11:46.476 --> 11:47.842
THIS OB-GYN POINTS OUT, IT'S

11:47.911 --> 11:50.077
JUST NOT THAT SIMPLE.

11:50.146 --> 11:50.878
>> SOME PEOPLE SAY, "WELL,

11:50.947 --> 11:52.213
DOCTORS SHOULD JUST DO IT.

11:52.282 --> 11:53.314
YOU SHOULD JUST GO TAKE THAT

11:53.383 --> 11:53.948
PATIENT TO THE OR, AND DO THAT

11:54.017 --> 11:55.516
ABORTION."

11:55.585 --> 11:56.651
I DON'T KNOW OF ANY DOCTOR WHO

11:56.720 --> 11:57.151
DOES AN ABORTION JUST BY

11:57.220 --> 11:58.519
THEMSELVES.

11:58.588 --> 11:59.587
IT REQUIRES AN ANESTHESIA TEAM,

11:59.656 --> 12:01.589
A NURSING TEAM, SUPERVISING TEAM

12:01.658 --> 12:03.858
TO GET YOU INTO THE OR.

12:03.927 --> 12:05.026
SO, IN ORDER FOR SOMEBODY TO --

12:05.095 --> 12:06.260
TO AGREE WITH ME AS I WANT TO

12:06.329 --> 12:07.228
TAKE THAT PATIENT TO THE OR,

12:07.297 --> 12:09.197
THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO

12:09.266 --> 12:10.364
ARE GOING TO WEIGH IN, TOO, AND

12:10.433 --> 12:11.165
BE SCARED AND SAY, "NO, NO, WE

12:11.234 --> 12:11.899
HAVE TO WAIT FOR LEGAL TO SIGN

12:11.968 --> 12:13.134
OFF."

12:13.203 --> 12:15.770
AND THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE DIE.

12:15.839 --> 12:17.138
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

12:17.207 --> 12:19.040
"WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR LEGAL TO

12:19.109 --> 12:20.842
SIGN OFF" IS NOT SOMETHING YOU

12:20.911 --> 12:21.442
WANT TO HEAR BEFORE RECEIVING

12:21.511 --> 12:23.678
URGENT MEDICAL CARE.

12:23.747 --> 12:25.079
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SAY

12:25.148 --> 12:26.814
WHEN WE WANT TO SHOW THIS PHOTO

12:26.883 --> 12:28.015
WHILE SAYING THE SENTENCE, "SEX

12:28.084 --> 12:30.852
CRIMES ARE BAD," OR PLAYFULLY

12:30.921 --> 12:32.620
ACCUSE A COAL BARON OF BEING THE

12:32.689 --> 12:33.521
ZODIAC KILLER.

12:33.590 --> 12:34.288
I SHOULDN'T JOKE ABOUT THAT,

12:34.357 --> 12:34.655
THOUGH.

12:34.724 --> 12:36.190
I'M SURE BOB MURRAY IS PROBABLY

12:36.259 --> 12:37.325
A LOT MORE SYMPATHETIC TO BLACK

12:37.394 --> 12:38.993
LUNG VICTIMS NOW THAT HE'S

12:39.062 --> 12:41.729
BURNING IN HELL.

12:41.798 --> 12:42.864
BUT THE LARGER POINT REMAINS

12:42.933 --> 12:44.232
THAT EVEN IF YOU DO HAVE ONE

12:44.301 --> 12:45.333
DOCTOR WILLING TO BREAK THE LAW

12:45.402 --> 12:46.567
AND ASSUME THE RISKS, YOU STILL

12:46.636 --> 12:48.069
MIGHT NOT HAVE A WHOLE TEAM.

12:48.138 --> 12:49.704
ABORTIONS ARE LIKE IMPROV.

12:49.773 --> 12:51.372
EVERYONE INVOLVED HAS TO BE

12:51.441 --> 12:53.674
FULLY ON BOARD.

12:53.743 --> 12:54.709
AND IF JUST ONE PERSON DOESN'T

12:54.778 --> 12:56.644
COMMIT, IT'S OVER.

12:56.713 --> 12:57.411
ALSO, EVEN WHEN IT GOES WELL,

12:57.480 --> 12:57.845
YOU'RE LIKE, "OKAY.

12:57.914 --> 12:58.646
THAT WAS FINE.

12:58.715 --> 12:59.380
CAN I GO HOME NOW?

12:59.449 --> 13:00.181
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME COME BACK

13:00.250 --> 13:02.150
NEXT WEEK."

13:02.219 --> 13:04.118
AND THE CRUSHING THING IS, THAT

13:04.187 --> 13:05.153
DOCTOR ISN'T EVEN BEING OVERLY

13:05.222 --> 13:06.420
CAUTIOUS THERE.

13:06.489 --> 13:07.889
BECAUSE WHILE THESE LAWS DO HAVE

13:07.958 --> 13:09.190
EXCEPTIONS IN INSTANCES WHERE

13:09.259 --> 13:10.558
THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER IS IN

13:10.627 --> 13:11.959
DANGER, THERE'S A HUGE

13:12.028 --> 13:13.427
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "LIFE" OF THE

13:13.496 --> 13:13.961
MOTHER AND "HEALTH" OF THE

13:14.030 --> 13:16.130
MOTHER.

13:16.199 --> 13:18.065
ALL OF THESE STATES HAVE NEAR

13:18.134 --> 13:19.634
TOTAL ABORTION BANS THAT DO NOT

13:19.703 --> 13:21.135
MAKE EXCEPTIONS CONSIDERING THE

13:21.204 --> 13:23.104
HEALTH OF THE MOTHER.

13:23.173 --> 13:23.905
BUT EVEN IN STATES THAT DO HAVE

13:23.974 --> 13:25.673
THOSE EXCEPTIONS, THEY'RE OFTEN

13:25.742 --> 13:26.274
WRITTEN SO VAGUELY OR NARROWLY

13:26.343 --> 13:27.475
THAT DOCTORS CAN BE UNSURE HOW

13:27.544 --> 13:30.845
TO APPLY THEM.

13:30.914 --> 13:37.914
TAKE TEXAS AGAIN, WHERE HEALTH

13:39.689 --> 13:40.254
EXCEPTIONS ONLY APPLY FOR A FEW

13:40.323 --> 13:42.290
HIGHLY SPECIFIC CONDITIONS.

13:42.359 --> 13:42.890
SO DOCTORS ARE WAITING UNTIL A

13:42.959 --> 13:43.458
PATIENT IS AT ACTUAL RISK OF

13:43.527 --> 13:44.025
IMMINENT DEATH TO INTERVENE.

13:44.094 --> 13:44.625
LISTEN TO THIS WOMAN DESCRIBE

13:44.694 --> 13:45.226
WHAT SHE WENT THROUGH AFTER A

13:45.295 --> 13:46.861
FATAL FETAL CONDITION WAS

13:46.930 --> 13:48.629
DIAGNOSED DURING HER PREGNANCY.

13:48.698 --> 13:50.097
>> I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL ONE OF

13:50.166 --> 13:51.132
THREE THINGS HAPPENED.

13:51.201 --> 13:52.834
EITHER HER HEART STOPPED

13:52.903 --> 13:54.602
BEATING, I WENT INTO LABOR

13:54.671 --> 13:57.071
NATURALLY, OR I BECAME SO SICK

13:57.140 --> 13:58.339
THAT MY LIFE WAS IN DANGER.

13:58.408 --> 14:00.708
AND AT THAT POINT, BECAUSE OF

14:00.777 --> 14:01.876
THE LAWS, THE DOCTORS WOULD BE

14:01.945 --> 14:04.612
ABLE TO INDUCE ME, AND WE COULD

14:04.681 --> 14:05.847
BEGIN THE DELIVERY PROCESS.

14:05.916 --> 14:06.881
I WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED ON

14:06.950 --> 14:09.984
TUESDAY, AND IT TOOK UNTIL

14:10.053 --> 14:12.320
FRIDAY FOR ONE OF THOSE THREE

14:12.389 --> 14:13.921
THINGS TO OCCUR.

14:13.990 --> 14:14.555
AND FOR ME, WHAT HAPPENED WAS, I

14:14.624 --> 14:16.390
GOT REALLY, REALLY SICK, REALLY,

14:16.459 --> 14:17.158
REALLY FAST.

14:17.227 --> 14:19.994
OBVIOUSLY, WE LIVE IN THE MIDDLE

14:20.063 --> 14:20.862
OF TEXAS, WHICH IS A GIANT

14:20.931 --> 14:21.762
STATE.

14:21.831 --> 14:23.564
SO, TO GET OUT OF TEXAS, AND TO

14:23.633 --> 14:25.733
GET TO A NEIGHBORING STATE WHERE

14:25.802 --> 14:26.367
WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN HEALTHCARE,

14:26.436 --> 14:28.102
WE WOULD'VE EITHER HAD TO DRIVE

14:28.171 --> 14:30.037
AT LEAST EIGHT HOURS OR FLY

14:30.106 --> 14:32.473
SOMEWHERE.

14:32.542 --> 14:34.108
>> John: OKAY, JUST SO WE'RE ALL

14:34.177 --> 14:35.009
PERFECTLY CLEAR, WHEN WE SAY

14:35.078 --> 14:35.910
THAT THESE LAWS TAKE AWAY

14:35.979 --> 14:37.178
PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO CONTROL THEIR

14:37.247 --> 14:38.246
OWN BODY.

14:38.315 --> 14:38.780
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING

14:38.849 --> 14:40.982
ABOUT.

14:41.051 --> 14:41.616
SHE HAD TO WAIT FROM TUESDAY TO

14:41.685 --> 14:42.650
FRIDAY TO GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO

14:42.719 --> 14:45.119
DYING TO BE SAVED.

14:45.188 --> 14:46.420
PREEMPTIVELY CHOOSING TO SAVE

14:46.489 --> 14:48.256
HER OWN LIFE WAS ILLEGAL IN HER

14:48.325 --> 14:49.624
STATE, A STATE THAT, REMEMBER,

14:49.693 --> 14:50.958
THIS MAN SAYS IS SAFE FOR LITTLE

14:51.027 --> 14:52.827
-- SORRY, FOR WOMEN.

14:52.896 --> 14:55.129
AND WHEN YOU TAKE ALL OF THIS

14:55.198 --> 14:56.097
INTO ACCOUNT, IT'S NO WONDER

14:56.166 --> 14:57.431
THAT WOMEN IN STATES WITH

14:57.500 --> 14:58.966
ABORTION BANS ARE NEARLY THREE

14:59.035 --> 15:00.501
TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE DURING

15:00.570 --> 15:01.436
PREGNANCY, CHILDBIRTH, OR SOON

15:01.505 --> 15:02.870
AFTER.

15:02.939 --> 15:03.838
AND THIS IS ONLY EXACERBATED FOR

15:03.907 --> 15:04.906
PEOPLE OF COLOR, WHO ALREADY

15:04.975 --> 15:06.908
FACED SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN

15:06.977 --> 15:08.209
MATERNAL AND INFANT HEALTH

15:08.278 --> 15:10.945
BEFORE THE DOBBS DECISION.

15:11.014 --> 15:12.380
AND AT THIS POINT, LET'S TALK

15:12.449 --> 15:14.081
ABOUT WHO IS MAKING THESE LAWS.

15:14.150 --> 15:16.083
BECAUSE THE RHETORIC AROUND THE

15:16.152 --> 15:17.385
DOBBS DECISION WAS THAT IT

15:17.454 --> 15:18.386
SIMPLY "RETURNED DECISIONS ON

15:18.455 --> 15:19.520
ABORTION TO THE STATES."

15:19.589 --> 15:22.790
WHICH IS A VERY NICE WAY TO SAY

15:22.859 --> 15:24.125
IT WAS REMOVING DECISIONS FROM

15:24.194 --> 15:25.359
INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR DOCTORS,

15:25.428 --> 15:26.727
AND PLACE THEM IN THE HANDS OF

15:26.796 --> 15:28.996
STATE LEGISLATORS.

15:29.065 --> 15:29.597
AND THOSE POLITICIANS ARE NOW

15:29.666 --> 15:31.065
LEGISLATING MEDICINE WITHOUT

15:31.134 --> 15:31.599
EVEN A MODICUM OF MEDICAL

15:31.668 --> 15:33.734
UNDERSTANDING.

15:33.803 --> 15:34.402
WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLY

15:34.471 --> 15:35.970
INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING FOR

15:36.039 --> 15:38.473
PEOPLE LIKE THIS OB-GYN.

15:38.542 --> 15:40.007
>> THERE'S THE FEELING THAT YOUR

15:40.076 --> 15:42.310
EXPERTISE -- NO ONE CARES.

15:42.379 --> 15:43.778
[LAUGHS]

15:43.847 --> 15:44.846
NO ONE CARES.

15:44.915 --> 15:45.446
WENT TO SCHOOL FOR 12 YEARS OF

15:45.515 --> 15:48.516
MY LIFE, DONE THIS FOR 33 YEARS,

15:48.585 --> 15:52.053
BUT THAT GUY FROM DOWN SOUTH IN

15:52.122 --> 15:55.156
OKLAHOMA, HE'S NEVER PICKED UP A

15:55.225 --> 15:55.790
MEDICAL TEXTBOOK IN HIS LIFE, HE

15:55.859 --> 16:00.128
KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT.

16:00.197 --> 16:00.595
I MEAN, THERE'S -- YOU

16:00.664 --> 16:01.162
DEFINITELY FEEL NO ONE CARES

16:01.231 --> 16:01.996
WHAT YOU THINK AS AN EXPERT.

16:02.065 --> 16:03.231
NO ONE CARES.

16:03.300 --> 16:04.499
>> John: RIGHT, AND I'D GIVE

16:04.568 --> 16:05.800
LITERALLY ANYTHING FOR

16:05.869 --> 16:07.068
LEGISLATORS IN OKLAHOMA TO HAVE

16:07.137 --> 16:08.703
TO EXPLAIN THEIR REASONING TO

16:08.772 --> 16:09.670
THIS DOCTOR, WHO LAUGHS LIKE A

16:09.739 --> 16:11.405
WOMAN WHO HAS SPENT 45 YEARS OF

16:11.474 --> 16:12.874
HER LIFE SMILING ON THE OUTSIDE

16:12.943 --> 16:14.742
AND SAYING "GO FUCK YOURSELF" ON

16:14.811 --> 16:15.710
THE INSIDE.

16:15.779 --> 16:17.745
WHICH I DO REALIZE SOUNDS LIKE

16:17.814 --> 16:19.213
THE TITLE OF A GUIDE TO BEING A

16:19.282 --> 16:20.782
WOMAN IN AMERICA.

16:20.851 --> 16:23.151
AND IT'S NOT JUST THAT THOSE

16:23.220 --> 16:24.051
PUSHING THESE LAWS ARE

16:24.120 --> 16:25.553
NON-EXPERTS -- THEY'RE ALSO

16:25.622 --> 16:26.521
OVERWHELMINGLY BEING PUSHED BY

16:26.590 --> 16:27.388
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET PREGNANT,

16:27.457 --> 16:29.223
EITHER.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.024
WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE SO-CALLED

16:30.093 --> 16:31.325
"TRIGGER LAWS" THAT BANNED

16:31.394 --> 16:34.428
ABORTION SO QUICKLY AFTER DOBBS,

16:34.497 --> 16:36.164
84% OF THE LAWMAKERS WHO

16:36.233 --> 16:37.131
SPONSORED THEM WERE MEN, AND

16:37.200 --> 16:38.065
LOOK -- CLEARLY, THEY'RE THE KEY

16:38.134 --> 16:39.967
PROBLEM HERE.

16:40.036 --> 16:41.469
BUT LET'S ALSO TAKE A SECOND FOR

16:41.538 --> 16:43.104
THE 16% OF LAWMAKERS WHO WERE

16:43.173 --> 16:44.338
WOMEN.

16:44.407 --> 16:45.940
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE A WOMAN VOTING

16:46.009 --> 16:47.508
AGAINST ABORTION ACCESS, YOU ARE

16:47.577 --> 16:48.910
-- AND I'M TOLD THAT THIS IS THE

16:48.979 --> 16:50.845
MEANEST THING THIS VOICE IS

16:50.914 --> 16:52.146
ALLOWED TO SAY -- NOT A GIRL'S

16:52.215 --> 16:54.749
GIRL.

16:54.818 --> 16:56.384
AND SOME OF THOSE MALE

16:56.453 --> 16:58.319
LEGISLATORS TRULY DIDN'T KNOW

16:58.388 --> 17:00.054
WHAT THEY WERE DOING -- AND

17:00.123 --> 17:01.456
THAT'S BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION.

17:01.525 --> 17:04.358
THIS IDAHO REPUBLICAN VOTED FOR

17:04.427 --> 17:05.893
AN ABORTION BAN AND HAS SINCE

17:05.962 --> 17:07.094
HAD SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW

17:07.163 --> 17:08.763
BROAD IT REALLY IS.

17:08.832 --> 17:09.997
BUT LISTEN TO HIM EXPLAIN JUST

17:10.066 --> 17:14.202
HOW LITTLE THOUGHT HE PUT INTO

17:14.271 --> 17:14.669
HIS ORIGINAL DECISION.

17:14.738 --> 17:15.436
>> IT REALLY WASN'T UP HIGH ON

17:15.505 --> 17:18.372
MY RADAR, OTHER THAN I'M A

17:18.441 --> 17:21.476
PRO-LIFE GUY, AND I RAN THAT

17:21.545 --> 17:23.111
WAY, BUT I DIDN'T SEE IT AS IT

17:23.180 --> 17:24.278
HAD A REAL -- HAVING A REAL BIG

17:24.347 --> 17:25.513
COMMUNITY IMPACT.

17:25.582 --> 17:26.747
>> THEN HE STARTED TALKING WITH

17:26.816 --> 17:28.116
LOCAL DOCTORS.

17:28.185 --> 17:29.250
>> WHAT I'M WONDERING IS, FOR

17:29.319 --> 17:30.384
YOU PERSONALLY, DID YOU THINK

17:30.453 --> 17:33.654
ABOUT ABORTION AS IT RELATES TO

17:33.723 --> 17:34.689
OBSTETRIC CARE FOR PREGNANT

17:34.758 --> 17:36.157
WOMEN?

17:36.226 --> 17:39.861
>> NO, I DON'T THINK I -- YOU

17:39.930 --> 17:40.695
KNOW, IT'S LIKE ANYTHING.

17:40.764 --> 17:42.497
YOU GET EXPOSED TO SOMETHING

17:42.566 --> 17:43.264
AND, ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU GO,

17:43.333 --> 17:44.999
WOW, THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY TO

17:45.068 --> 17:49.003
LOOK AT THIS.

17:49.072 --> 17:50.438
>> John: LOOK, PART OF ME WANTS

17:50.507 --> 17:51.839
TO WELCOME THAT MAN'S ABILITY TO

17:51.908 --> 17:53.241
RECOGNIZE HIS OWN BLIND SPOTS

17:53.310 --> 17:54.075
THERE.

17:54.144 --> 17:54.976
BUT ARE YOU REALLY SAYING YOU

17:55.045 --> 17:56.444
DIDN'T THINK ABOUT HOW YOUR VOTE

17:56.513 --> 17:57.945
WOULD AFFECT LITERALLY HALF OF

17:58.014 --> 17:59.714
YOUR CONSTITUENTS?

17:59.783 --> 18:01.249
YOU'RE A FUCKING LEGISLATOR.

18:01.318 --> 18:03.184
THAT'S NOT A CUTE LITTLE OOPSIE.

18:03.253 --> 18:04.485
IT'S NOT LIKE JOKING THAT

18:04.554 --> 18:05.686
TIMOTHEE CHALAMET COULD PLAY A

18:05.755 --> 18:07.555
YOUNG WILLY WONKA AND THE STUDIO

18:07.624 --> 18:08.689
IMMEDIATELY GREENLIT IT AND NOW

18:08.758 --> 18:09.323
YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

18:09.392 --> 18:11.492
FUCK THAT MEANS.

18:11.561 --> 18:13.427
THAT IS A DERELICTION OF DUTY.

18:13.496 --> 18:16.330
SO, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

18:16.399 --> 18:17.365
WELL, FIRST, DO FEEL FREE TO

18:17.434 --> 18:18.833
SCREAM -- INTO A PILLOW, WHEN

18:18.902 --> 18:21.002
YOU'RE ON THE BUS, ON THE KISS

18:21.071 --> 18:22.069
CAM AT A BASKETBALL GAME.

18:22.138 --> 18:23.671
THERE'S NO INAPPROPRIATE TIME TO

18:23.740 --> 18:24.939
BE SCREAMING ABOUT THIS.

18:25.008 --> 18:27.341
BUT KNOW THAT WE CAN ALSO STILL

18:27.410 --> 18:28.643
ACT HERE.

18:28.712 --> 18:30.378
SOME HAVE TAKEN SOME SMALL STEPS

18:30.447 --> 18:31.145
IN THE LAST YEAR THAT ARE, IF

18:31.214 --> 18:32.246
NOTHING ELSE, IMMENSELY

18:32.315 --> 18:33.514
SATISFYING -- LIKE THIS ONE,

18:33.583 --> 18:37.251
THAT WAS COVERED BY A CATHOLIC

18:37.320 --> 18:37.819
NEWS NETWORK.

18:37.888 --> 18:40.788
>> AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP NAMED

18:40.857 --> 18:42.557
AFTER SATAN WILL SOON OPEN ITS

18:42.626 --> 18:43.157
FIRST ABORTION BUSINESS IN THE

18:43.226 --> 18:44.692
UNITED STATES.

18:44.761 --> 18:46.060
THE SATANIC TEMPLE, WHICH CLAIMS

18:46.129 --> 18:47.028
TO "NOT BELIEVE IN A LITERAL

18:47.097 --> 18:48.863
SATAN," WILL PROVIDE TELEHEALTH

18:48.932 --> 18:50.331
SCREENINGS AND PRESCRIBE

18:50.400 --> 18:51.466
ABORTION PILLS FOR PATIENTS IN

18:51.535 --> 18:53.634
NEW MEXICO.

18:53.703 --> 18:54.502
THE NAME OF THE SOON TO BE

18:54.571 --> 18:56.938
FACILITY?

18:57.007 --> 18:57.572
THE SAMUEL ALITO'S MOM'S SATANIC

18:57.641 --> 18:59.540
ABORTION CLINIC.

18:59.609 --> 19:01.275
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

19:01.344 --> 19:02.910
>> John: INCREDIBLE.

19:02.979 --> 19:04.145
VERY WELL-PLAYED.

19:04.214 --> 19:05.880
NOW, IS THAT GOING TO FIX

19:05.949 --> 19:06.681
EVERYTHING?

19:06.750 --> 19:07.815
OF COURSE NOT.

19:07.884 --> 19:08.449
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO RESPONDING

19:08.518 --> 19:10.351
TO SUCH WIDE-SPREADING

19:10.420 --> 19:11.619
DEVASTATION, YOU COULD DO A LOT

19:11.688 --> 19:12.887
WORSE THAN THE SINGLE BEST

19:12.956 --> 19:15.356
"YOUR MOM" JOKE OF ALL TIME.

19:15.425 --> 19:16.891
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ADD IN THAT

19:16.960 --> 19:17.925
ONE OF THAT GROUP'S COFOUNDERS

19:17.994 --> 19:19.460
EVEN SAID, IN 1950, SAMUEL

19:19.529 --> 19:22.263
ALITO'S MOTHER DID NOT HAVE

19:22.332 --> 19:25.867
OPTIONS, AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.

19:25.936 --> 19:27.635
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR

19:27.704 --> 19:28.569
YOU TO DO RIGHT NOW IS -- AND I

19:28.638 --> 19:30.605
APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE FOR EVEN

19:30.674 --> 19:33.040
SAYING THIS -- TO VOTE.

19:33.109 --> 19:33.641
ABORTION RIGHTS ARE -- FOR ALL

19:33.710 --> 19:34.876
THE ATTACKS ON THEM -- STILL

19:34.945 --> 19:37.378
WIDELY POPULAR.

19:37.447 --> 19:37.812
SIX STATES HAVE HAD

19:37.881 --> 19:39.313
ABORTION-RELATED MEASURES ON THE

19:39.382 --> 19:40.148
BALLOT SINCE DOBBS, AND IN ALL

19:40.217 --> 19:42.083
SIX, VOTERS PRESERVED ACCESS TO

19:42.152 --> 19:43.818
ABORTION.

19:43.887 --> 19:45.253
AND THAT WAS EVEN TRUE IN RED

19:45.322 --> 19:46.988
STATES LIKE MONTANA, KANSAS, AND

19:47.057 --> 19:48.623
KENTUCKY.

19:48.692 --> 19:49.490
THIS IS GENUINELY A CASE WHERE

19:49.559 --> 19:50.758
VOTING CAN HAVE IMMEDIATE, AND

19:50.827 --> 19:52.426
LASTING, EFFECT.

19:52.495 --> 19:54.195
TO THAT END, AS I'VE MENTIONED,

19:54.264 --> 19:55.563
THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT

19:55.632 --> 19:56.864
ELECTIONS ON TUESDAY WHERE IT'S

19:56.933 --> 19:58.399
GOING TO BE CRUCIAL TO CONTINUE

19:58.468 --> 19:59.734
THAT STREAK.

19:59.803 --> 20:01.002
IF YOU LIVE IN VIRGINIA,

20:01.071 --> 20:02.837
DEMOCRATS LOST THE HOUSE AND

20:02.906 --> 20:04.338
GOVERNOR'S SEAT IN 2021, BUT

20:04.407 --> 20:06.574
STILL CONTROL THE STATE SENATE.

20:06.643 --> 20:07.875
AND ONLY BECAUSE OF THAT WERE

20:07.944 --> 20:09.243
THEY ABLE, EARLIER THIS YEAR

20:09.312 --> 20:10.511
THEY WERE ABLE TO STOP THREE

20:10.580 --> 20:11.712
BILLS THAT WOULD HAVE RESTRICTED

20:11.781 --> 20:12.313
ABORTION.

20:12.382 --> 20:13.681
BUT IF THEY LOSE THE SENATE NEXT

20:13.750 --> 20:14.315
WEEK, THAT WILL CLEARLY CHANGE.

20:14.384 --> 20:15.550
MEANWHILE, IN KENTUCKY, THE

20:15.619 --> 20:16.184
INCUMBENT GOVERNOR, ANDY BESHEAR

20:16.253 --> 20:19.387
IS BEING CHALLENGED BY

20:19.456 --> 20:22.623
CONSERVATIVE AG DANIEL CAMERON

20:22.692 --> 20:23.691
-- WHO YOU MIGHT REMEMBER FROM

20:23.760 --> 20:27.295
DISASTROUS HANDLING OF THE

20:27.364 --> 20:27.728
BREONNA TAYLOR CASE.

20:27.797 --> 20:28.162
HE'S ALSO SAID IN A

20:28.231 --> 20:28.763
QUESTIONNAIRE CIRCULATED BY AN

20:28.832 --> 20:29.363
ANTI-ABORTION GROUP THAT HE'D

20:29.432 --> 20:30.331
SUPPORT CODIFYING PERSONHOOD

20:30.400 --> 20:30.832
FROM THE MOMENT OF

20:30.901 --> 20:31.766
FERTILIZATION, AND CRIMINALIZING

20:31.835 --> 20:36.270
PROVIDERS WHO PERFORM ABORTIONS.

20:36.339 --> 20:36.871
AND WHILE ALL THAT'S OBVIOUSLY

20:36.940 --> 20:37.505
TERRIBLE -- HOW EXACTLY DOES HE

20:37.574 --> 20:39.040
INTEND TO ENFORCE LIFE BEGINNING

20:39.109 --> 20:40.508
"AT FERTILIZATION?"

20:40.577 --> 20:41.109
DOES EVERYONE HAVE TO FUCK IN

20:41.178 --> 20:46.247
FRONT OF HIM?

20:46.316 --> 20:47.782
NO THANK YOU VERY MUCH, DANIEL!

20:47.851 --> 20:48.382
THE ONLY KENTUCKIAN WHO SHOULD

20:48.451 --> 20:49.117
ENJOY THAT PRIVILEGE IS THE

20:49.186 --> 20:51.185
COLONEL.

20:51.254 --> 20:51.752
AND NO, NOT THAT ONE -- I'M

20:51.821 --> 20:52.753
TALKING ABOUT THE REBA COLONEL.

20:52.822 --> 20:55.256
THERE WE GO.

20:55.325 --> 20:57.325
SIR, MADAM, ENBY ICON: IT WOULD

20:57.394 --> 20:58.459
BE AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE TO

20:58.528 --> 21:02.130
FORNICATE IN YOUR PRESENCE.

21:02.199 --> 21:02.697
AND FINALLY, IF YOU LIVE IN

21:02.766 --> 21:05.166
OHIO, A BALLOT MEASURE ON

21:05.235 --> 21:05.766
TUESDAY WOULD ENSHRINE A RIGHT

21:05.835 --> 21:06.334
TO ABORTION IN YOUR STATE'S

21:06.403 --> 21:07.368
CONSTITUTION.

21:07.437 --> 21:08.169
IT'S A MEASURE THAT'S CURRENTLY

21:08.238 --> 21:09.203
BEING TARGETED BY ITS OPPONENTS

21:09.272 --> 21:09.837
IN SOME WILDLY MISLEADING

21:09.906 --> 21:13.241
CAMPAIGN ADS.

21:13.310 --> 21:13.775
>> THE ABORTION INDUSTRY'S

21:13.844 --> 21:14.909
PROPOSED AMENDMENT WOULD ALLOW

21:14.978 --> 21:20.281
NO LIMIT ABORTIONS IN OHIO,

21:20.350 --> 21:23.818
ABORTIONS WHEN THE BABY CAN FEEL

21:23.887 --> 21:26.654
PAIN, EXCRUCIATING PAIN.

21:26.723 --> 21:29.891
ON TOP OF THAT, THE SAME RADICAL

21:29.960 --> 21:30.424
GROUPS WANT TO TEAR AT THE

21:30.493 --> 21:33.795
FABRIC THAT HOLDS OUR FAMILIES

21:33.864 --> 21:34.428
TOGETHER, ALLOW OUR CHILDREN TO

21:34.497 --> 21:36.631
GET ABORTIONS WITHOUT OUR

21:36.700 --> 21:38.166
CONSENT AND REMOVE ALL

21:38.235 --> 21:40.568
PROTECTIONS FOR THE UNBORN.

21:40.637 --> 21:41.102
AS PARENTS, IT'S OUR WORST

21:41.171 --> 21:43.070
NIGHTMARE.

21:43.139 --> 21:44.305
>> John: WOW, THAT AD'S ARGUMENT

21:44.374 --> 21:45.773
IS BASICALLY, "ABORTION RIGHTS

21:45.842 --> 21:47.074
ARE AN ASSAULT ON THE

21:47.143 --> 21:48.276
TRADITIONAL AMERICAN FAMILY: "A

21:48.345 --> 21:50.144
FATHER, A MOTHER, AND ANOTHER

21:50.213 --> 21:54.081
MOTHER WHO'S TWELVE."

21:54.150 --> 21:54.849
ALSO, IF, AS A PARENT, YOUR

21:54.918 --> 21:56.484
WORST NIGHTMARE IS YOUR CHILD

21:56.553 --> 21:57.485
GETTING PREGNANT AND NOT HAVING

21:57.554 --> 21:58.953
TO STAY THAT WAY IF THEY DON'T

21:59.022 --> 22:00.221
WANT TO, I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS

22:00.290 --> 22:00.688
WE JUST HAVE DIFFERENT

22:00.757 --> 22:02.123
NIGHTMARES.

22:02.192 --> 22:03.591
BECAUSE THERE'S AN OBJECTIVELY

22:03.660 --> 22:05.193
CORRECT HIERARCHY OF PARENTAL

22:05.262 --> 22:05.827
FEARS AND IT'S: ONE, LOSING ONE

22:05.896 --> 22:06.561
OF YOUR CHILDREN.

22:06.630 --> 22:07.061
TWO, SOMETHING TERRIBLE

22:07.130 --> 22:08.963
HAPPENING TO ONE OF YOUR

22:09.032 --> 22:09.864
CHILDREN.

22:09.933 --> 22:10.465
THREE, LOSING ONE OF THEM BUT

22:10.534 --> 22:11.766
NOT IN A DEAD WAY, IN THE "OH,

22:11.835 --> 22:12.400
FUCK, I CAN'T FIND THEM" WAY AND

22:12.469 --> 22:14.902
THEN YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER

22:14.971 --> 22:15.870
TO LOOK FOR THEM ON YOUR OWN, OR

22:15.939 --> 22:17.105
LET SOMEONE KNOW IMMEDIATELY

22:17.174 --> 22:18.072
THAT THEY'RE MISSING.

22:18.141 --> 22:18.673
BECAUSE IF SOMETHING'S REALLY

22:18.742 --> 22:19.474
WRONG, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED

22:19.543 --> 22:19.674
HELP.

22:19.743 --> 22:21.142
BUT IF THEY'RE JUST KIND OF

22:21.211 --> 22:22.376
AROUND LOOKING FOR LEGO SETS,

22:22.445 --> 22:23.978
YOU DON'T WANT TO ANNOUNCE TO

22:24.047 --> 22:25.246
THE TARGET EMPLOYEES THAT YOU'RE

22:25.315 --> 22:26.147
A NEGLIGENT PARENT WHO MISPLACED

22:26.216 --> 22:27.415
YOUR CHILD.

22:27.484 --> 22:28.649
NUMBER FOUR, YOUR CHILDREN

22:28.718 --> 22:29.550
HATING YOU FOR EXACTLY THE

22:29.619 --> 22:30.585
PERSON YOU ARE, THAT'S NOT

22:30.654 --> 22:31.619
BECAUSE OF ANY MISUNDERSTANDING

22:31.688 --> 22:32.753
OR ANYTHING.

22:32.822 --> 22:34.188
YOUR KIDS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT

22:34.257 --> 22:34.655
YOU'RE ABOUT AND THEY

22:34.724 --> 22:35.857
JUSTIFIABLY WANT NOTHING TO DO

22:35.926 --> 22:37.592
WITH YOU.

22:37.661 --> 22:38.392
AND FINALLY, NUMBER FIVE, YOUR

22:38.461 --> 22:38.926
CHILD GETS REALLY GOOD AT

22:38.995 --> 22:41.095
SWIMMING.

22:41.164 --> 22:42.497
BECAUSE THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO

22:42.566 --> 22:44.165
TAKE THEM TO THE POOL BY 5 A.M.

22:44.234 --> 22:44.699
EVERY OTHER MORNING FOR 10

22:44.768 --> 22:48.402
FUCKING YEARS.

22:48.471 --> 22:49.370
A CHILD EXERCISING BODILY

22:49.439 --> 22:50.738
AUTONOMY IS NOWHERE NEAR A WORST

22:50.807 --> 22:52.440
NIGHTMARE SCENARIO.

22:52.509 --> 22:53.341
EXCEPT FOR MAYBE THE SWIMMING

22:53.410 --> 22:55.343
THING.

22:55.412 --> 22:57.211
LOOK, THIS PAST YEAR AND A HALF

22:57.280 --> 22:58.212
HAS CLEARLY BEEN DEVASTATING

22:58.281 --> 22:58.746
WHEN IT COMES TO ABORTION

22:58.815 --> 22:59.480
RIGHTS.

22:59.549 --> 23:00.715
AND TO BE CLEAR, I'M NOT JUST

23:00.784 --> 23:01.749
TALKING ABOUT THE QUOTE

23:01.818 --> 23:02.583
"UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES" AROUND

23:02.652 --> 23:04.886
WANTED PREGNANCIES.

23:04.955 --> 23:07.121
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE INTENDED

23:07.190 --> 23:07.722
ONES FOR UNWANTED PREGNANCIES,

23:07.791 --> 23:09.056
TOO.

23:09.125 --> 23:09.557
AN ABORTION IS A MEDICAL

23:09.626 --> 23:11.592
DECISION BETWEEN A PATIENT AND

23:11.661 --> 23:13.327
THEIR DOCTOR, FULL STOP.

23:13.396 --> 23:15.163
AND IT'S MADDENING TO SEE SOME

23:15.232 --> 23:16.464
PUSH TO MAKE THEIR STATES SAFE

23:16.533 --> 23:17.765
FOR LITTLE BABIES, WHILE ALSO

23:17.834 --> 23:19.567
MAKING IT FAR MORE DANGEROUS FOR

23:19.636 --> 23:22.570
THE PEOPLE THEY GROW UP TO BE.

23:22.639 --> 23:23.938
BUT THE HOPE HERE, AND THERE

23:24.007 --> 23:26.340
ACTUALLY IS HOPE, IS THAT AS

23:26.409 --> 23:27.742
MUCH AS THE NEEDS, LIVES, AND

23:27.811 --> 23:28.876
CHOICES OF WOMEN HAVE BEEN

23:28.945 --> 23:30.645
DISMISSED, IS ALSO HOW MUCH

23:30.714 --> 23:31.712
THEIR ANGER AND TENACITY HAS

23:31.781 --> 23:34.182
BEEN UNDERESTIMATED.

23:34.251 --> 23:34.816
YOU'VE SEEN DOCTORS AND MEDICAL

23:34.885 --> 23:37.251
PROFESSIONALS OFFERING THEIR

23:37.320 --> 23:38.820
SELVES AND SERVICES.

23:38.889 --> 23:41.022
AND YOU'VE SEEN PEOPLE LIKE

23:41.091 --> 23:42.256
THESE, BRAVELY AND SELFLESSLY

23:42.325 --> 23:43.291
RELIVING PRIVATE, OFTEN

23:43.360 --> 23:44.025
DIFFICULT MOMENTS, TO EDUCATE

23:44.094 --> 23:46.461
AND GALVANIZE OTHERS.

23:46.530 --> 23:48.362
SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORKING

23:48.431 --> 23:49.564
TIRELESSLY TO MAKE THIS BETTER.

23:49.633 --> 23:50.998
AND I WISH THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO.

23:51.067 --> 23:52.300
I WISH THEY COULD DEVOTE THEIR

23:52.369 --> 23:53.067
LIVES AND TALENTS TO SOMETHING

23:53.136 --> 23:55.136
BESIDES PUBLICLY FIGHTING FOR

23:55.205 --> 23:56.304
BASIC, NECESSARY HEALTHCARE.

23:56.373 --> 23:57.872
BUT THEY CAN'T.

23:57.941 --> 23:59.574
BECAUSE THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

23:59.643 --> 24:00.708
AND ONE THAT REQUIRES ACTION

24:00.777 --> 24:02.210
FROM ALL OF US.

24:02.279 --> 24:03.778
AND HOPEFULLY, ONE DAY, WE CAN

26:27.457 --> 26:28.256
>> John: YES, IT'S NEW ZEALAND'S

26:28.325 --> 26:29.991
BIRD OF THE CENTURY COMPETITION.

26:30.060 --> 26:31.993
AND KUDOS FOR STEALING THE THEME

26:32.062 --> 26:33.094
FROM "VEEP" THERE, TO REALLY

26:33.163 --> 26:34.061
DRIVE HOME THE GRAVITY OF THE

26:34.130 --> 26:35.830
CONTEST.

26:35.899 --> 26:37.665
BECAUSE THIS IS A BIG DEAL.

26:37.734 --> 26:39.634
NEW ZEALANDERS LOVE BIRDS.

26:39.703 --> 26:40.868
THEY'RE FAMOUSLY KNOWN AS

26:40.937 --> 26:42.603
"KIWIS," AFTER THE KIWI BIRD.

26:42.672 --> 26:43.805
AND BIRDS FEATURE PROMINENTLY ON

26:43.874 --> 26:44.472
THEIR CURRENCY.

26:44.541 --> 26:45.706
WHICH IS FRANKLY MUCH BETTER

26:45.775 --> 26:46.908
THAN WHAT U.S. BILLS HAVE ON

26:46.977 --> 26:48.509
THEM, WHICH IS "ASSORTED RACISTS

26:48.578 --> 26:52.413
AND TRACE AMOUNTS OF COCAINE."

26:52.482 --> 26:53.948
NEW ZEALAND ALSO HAS A LOT OF

26:54.017 --> 26:55.316
UNIQUE BIRDS.

26:55.385 --> 26:57.218
A 2017 GOVERNMENT REPORT FOUND

26:57.287 --> 26:59.821
THAT OF THE 168 SPECIES OF

26:59.890 --> 27:00.888
NATIVE BIRDS IN NEW ZEALAND, 93

27:00.957 --> 27:01.489
WERE ENDEMIC, MEANING THEY'RE

27:01.558 --> 27:04.358
FOUND NOWHERE ELSE.

27:04.427 --> 27:05.460
BUT IN THE PAST COUPLE OF

27:05.529 --> 27:06.894
CENTURIES, THE NUMBERS OF NATIVE

27:06.963 --> 27:07.628
BIRDS THERE HAVE DROPPED

27:07.697 --> 27:09.997
DRAMATICALLY.

27:10.066 --> 27:10.731
THAT'S WHY THE CONSERVATION

27:10.800 --> 27:12.667
ORGANIZATION FOREST & BIRD

27:12.736 --> 27:13.668
STARTED A "BIRD OF THE YEAR"

27:13.737 --> 27:15.069
COMPETITION BACK IN 2005 TO

27:15.138 --> 27:16.537
RAISE AWARENESS OF NATIVE BIRDS

27:16.606 --> 27:18.639
AND THE THREATS THEY FACE.

27:18.708 --> 27:20.341
AND THIS YEAR, IT'S "BIRD OF THE

27:20.410 --> 27:20.942
CENTURY," WHICH IS CLEARLY THE

27:21.011 --> 27:23.144
BIGGEST ONE YET.

27:23.213 --> 27:24.412
BUT FOR A WELL-MEANING

27:24.481 --> 27:25.913
COMPETITION, IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN

27:25.982 --> 27:26.881
A BIT OF A LIGHTNING ROD FOR

27:26.950 --> 27:27.915
CONTROVERSY IN THE PAST.

27:27.984 --> 27:28.950
JUST TAKE THE REACTION TO WHAT

27:29.019 --> 27:29.550
HAPPENED AHEAD OF LAST YEAR'S

27:29.619 --> 27:31.652
CONTEST.

27:31.721 --> 27:33.488
>> THE WORLD'S FATTEST PARROT,

27:33.557 --> 27:34.255
THE KAKAPO, HAS BEEN KICKED OUT.

27:34.324 --> 27:35.623
MELISSA, WHY?

27:35.692 --> 27:36.991
>> WELL, BECAUSE IT'S WON TWO

27:37.060 --> 27:38.759
TIMES PREVIOUSLY, 2020 AND 2008.

27:38.828 --> 27:41.229
>> TOO BIG FOR ITS BOOTS.

27:41.298 --> 27:42.130
>> WELL, WHAT THEY'RE WORRIED

27:42.199 --> 27:43.264
ABOUT IS THAT IT'S TAKING THE

27:43.333 --> 27:43.831
SPOTLIGHT FROM LESSER-KNOWN

27:43.900 --> 27:45.967
BIRDS.

27:46.036 --> 27:48.136
>> John: IT'S TRUE, THIS BIRD,

27:48.205 --> 27:49.737
THE KAKAPO, WAS DISQUALIFIED

27:49.806 --> 27:51.072
BECAUSE IT HAD ALREADY WON

27:51.141 --> 27:51.706
TWICE.

27:51.775 --> 27:53.541
WHICH IS BULLSHIT.

27:53.610 --> 27:54.308
WE DON'T DO THAT FOR OTHER

27:54.377 --> 27:55.543
AWARDS.

27:55.612 --> 27:56.444
"SORRY, BEYONCE, BUT SINCE

27:56.513 --> 27:57.912
YOU'VE ALREADY WON 32 GRAMMYS,

27:57.981 --> 27:59.247
YOU'RE DISQUALIFIED FROM NOW ON

27:59.316 --> 28:00.515
SO THAT SOMEONE WORSE THAN YOU

28:00.584 --> 28:00.948
CAN WIN.

28:01.017 --> 28:03.317
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND!"

28:03.386 --> 28:05.253
BESIDES, THE KAKAPO EARNED THOSE

28:05.322 --> 28:06.120
WINS.

28:06.189 --> 28:09.791
IT'S THE WORLD'S FATTEST PARROT.

28:09.860 --> 28:10.925
AND IF YOU'RE NOT ALREADY ON

28:10.994 --> 28:11.926
BOARD: THEY'RE ALSO FRIENDLY,

28:11.995 --> 28:13.828
AND THEY SMELL NICE.

28:13.897 --> 28:14.796
THOSE ARE TWO QUALITIES I HAVE

28:14.865 --> 28:16.397
NEVER ASSOCIATED WITH ANY BIRD,

28:16.466 --> 28:19.767
PRESENT COMPANY INCLUDED.

28:19.836 --> 28:21.068
AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY OF

28:21.137 --> 28:22.236
ALL, THE KAKAPO GIFTED THE WORLD

28:22.305 --> 28:26.340
WITH THIS INCREDIBLE CLIP.

28:26.409 --> 28:27.408
>> A TYPICAL MALE, SIROCCO IS

28:27.477 --> 28:29.644
CLEARLY ONLY INTERESTED IN ONE

28:29.713 --> 28:33.948
THING.

28:34.017 --> 28:34.282
>> OH, HELLO!

28:34.351 --> 28:37.552
>> OH, LOOK AT THAT!

28:37.621 --> 28:39.720
>> OW!

28:39.789 --> 28:43.224
GOD, HE'S GOT SHARP CLAWS.

28:43.293 --> 28:43.991
>> HE'S GETTING A BIT FRISKY.

28:44.060 --> 28:47.261
>> OW, OW!

28:47.330 --> 28:48.362
>> DO YOU THINK IT IS A -- HE'S

28:48.431 --> 28:50.331
ACTUALLY ATTEMPTING A SORT OF

28:50.400 --> 28:51.332
MATING RITUAL?

28:51.401 --> 28:53.768
HE IS?

28:53.837 --> 28:57.705
OH, MARK, YOU ARE BEING SHAGGED!

28:57.774 --> 28:59.407
>> OW, WOW IT'S SHARP.

28:59.476 --> 29:01.709
>> LOOK, HE'S SO HAPPY!

29:01.778 --> 29:03.077
I'M SORRY, BUT IT'S ONE OF THE

29:03.146 --> 29:06.747
FUNNIEST THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN.

29:06.816 --> 29:08.182
YOU ARE BEING SHAGGED BY A RARE

29:08.251 --> 29:11.119
PARROT.

29:11.188 --> 29:13.321
HE THINKS YOU ARE A FEMALE.

29:13.390 --> 29:14.155
>> OW!

29:14.224 --> 29:16.390
>> HE'S REALLY GOING FOR IT.

29:16.459 --> 29:17.758
WOW, YOU'VE CHOSEN HIM.

29:17.827 --> 29:18.526
IS IT -- ACTUALLY, YOU ARE IN

29:18.595 --> 29:20.261
PAIN, AREN'T YOU?

29:20.330 --> 29:21.229
>> John: SPECTACULAR.

29:21.298 --> 29:22.630
JUST SPECTACULAR.

29:22.699 --> 29:23.498
THOUGH SPARE A THOUGHT FOR THAT

29:23.567 --> 29:24.565
KAKAPO.

29:24.634 --> 29:25.800
I KNOW HE LOOKS HAPPY THERE BUT

29:25.869 --> 29:27.769
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW INSECURE HE

29:27.838 --> 29:29.036
ALSO MUST HAVE FELT?

29:29.105 --> 29:30.371
IMAGINE THIS: YOU'VE JUST MET

29:30.440 --> 29:31.339
SOMEONE THAT YOU INSTANTLY

29:31.408 --> 29:32.406
CONNECT WITH, YOU BRING THEM

29:32.475 --> 29:33.841
BACK TO YOUR PLACE, UNDRESS, GET

29:33.910 --> 29:35.176
IN BED, START TO HAVE SEX -- YOU

29:35.245 --> 29:37.845
KNOW WHAT, NO, MAKE LOVE.

29:37.914 --> 29:41.449
BUT THE WHOLE TIME STEPHEN FRY

29:41.518 --> 29:43.251
IS RIGHT NEXT TO YOU POINTING,

29:43.320 --> 29:44.385
LAUGHING, AND SAYING "THIS IS

29:44.454 --> 29:46.154
ONE OF THE FUNNIEST THINGS I'VE

29:46.223 --> 29:46.454
EVER SEEN?"

29:46.523 --> 29:47.054
THEN SOMEONE TAKES THAT SEXUAL

29:47.123 --> 29:47.655
HUMILIATION AND PUTS IT UP ON

29:47.724 --> 29:49.157
YOUTUBE, WHERE IT'S VIEWED

29:49.226 --> 29:51.926
25 MILLION TIMES?

29:51.995 --> 29:53.361
THEN, SOME ASSHOLE ON HBO SHOWS

29:53.430 --> 29:54.762
IT TO HIS STUDIO AUDIENCE, AND

29:54.831 --> 29:56.597
THEY ALL LAUGH, TOO?

29:56.666 --> 29:57.665
THE VERY FACT THAT THIS BIRD HAS

29:57.734 --> 29:59.167
BEEN ABLE TO KEEP HIMSELF

29:59.236 --> 30:02.370
AROUSED, HUMPING, AND FOCUSED ON

30:02.439 --> 30:03.805
HIS PARTNER, THAT ZOOLOGIST'S

30:03.874 --> 30:05.907
HEAD, IS, FRANKLY, HEROIC TO ME.

30:05.976 --> 30:06.841
BUT AMAZINGLY, THE KAKAPO'S

30:06.910 --> 30:08.643
DISQUALIFICATION WAS ACTUALLY A

30:08.712 --> 30:10.778
STEP UP FROM 2021, WHEN THERE

30:10.847 --> 30:12.547
WAS AN ABSOLUTE UPROAR AFTER A

30:12.616 --> 30:13.414
BAT WAS AWARDED BIRD OF THE

30:13.483 --> 30:15.383
YEAR.

30:15.452 --> 30:17.051
SPECIFICALLY, THIS ABSOLUTE

30:17.120 --> 30:17.819
GOOBER OF A BAT, THE LONG-TAILED

30:17.888 --> 30:19.620
BAT.

30:19.689 --> 30:21.189
AND FORGET BIRD OF THE YEAR, I

30:21.258 --> 30:22.056
WOULDN'T EVEN GIVE THAT BAT

30:22.125 --> 30:24.525
"BAT OF THE YEAR."

30:24.594 --> 30:25.059
APPARENTLY IT "TECHNICALLY

30:25.128 --> 30:26.727
QUALIFIED" BECAUSE IT WAS

30:26.796 --> 30:27.361
ENTERED USING THE TERM MANU, THE

30:27.430 --> 30:29.497
MAORI WORD FOR BIRD, WHICH

30:29.566 --> 30:31.098
GENERALLY MEANS WINGED CREATURE.

30:31.167 --> 30:33.000
BUT COME ON.

30:33.069 --> 30:34.335
JUST BECAUSE IT HAS WINGS,

30:34.404 --> 30:36.771
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH?

30:36.840 --> 30:38.072
VOTERS SHOULDN'T USE THE SAME

30:38.141 --> 30:41.476
CRITERIA AS SOMEONE BOARDING A

30:41.545 --> 30:42.543
SOUTHWEST AIRLINES FLIGHT.

30:42.612 --> 30:43.678
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THE YEAR

30:43.747 --> 30:44.278
BEFORE, THERE WAS YET ANOTHER

30:44.347 --> 30:46.414
SCANDAL.

30:46.483 --> 30:47.882
>> NEW ZEALAND'S BIRD OF THE

30:47.951 --> 30:49.684
YEAR COMPETITION HAS BEEN ROCKED

30:49.753 --> 30:52.120
WITH REVELATIONS OF A SLEW OF

30:52.189 --> 30:53.087
FRAUDULENT VOTES STREAMED IN

30:53.156 --> 30:56.190
OVERNIGHT FOR THE LITTLE SPOTTED

30:56.259 --> 30:57.959
KIWI WHICH PUSHED IT INTO AN

30:58.028 --> 31:00.561
UNEXPECTED AND FALSE LEAD.

31:00.630 --> 31:03.498
>> John: YEAH, BIRD VOTER FRAUD!

31:03.567 --> 31:05.166
AND I THINK MY FAVORITE PART

31:05.235 --> 31:05.766
ABOUT THAT IS THE NEWS ANCHOR

31:05.835 --> 31:07.268
CALLING THE LITTLE SPOTTED

31:07.337 --> 31:12.673
KIWI'S LEAD "UNEXPECTED."

31:12.742 --> 31:13.241
BECAUSE THAT IS AN EXCELLENT

31:13.310 --> 31:13.508
BIRD NEG.

31:13.577 --> 31:14.108
"YEAH, OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE WAS

31:14.177 --> 31:14.742
SHOCKED WHEN THEY SAW THE LITTLE

31:14.811 --> 31:15.676
SPOTTED KIWI IN THE LEAD AND

31:15.745 --> 31:17.078
IMMEDIATELY KNEW SOMETHING WAS

31:17.147 --> 31:17.278
AFOOT.

31:17.347 --> 31:18.846
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO WAY THIS

31:18.915 --> 31:19.781
LITTLE FLIGHTLESS FREAK COULD

31:19.850 --> 31:21.149
EVER WIN ANYTHING LEGITIMATELY,

31:21.218 --> 31:22.283
EXCEPT MAYBE A FUCKED-UP FERRET

31:22.352 --> 31:25.052
LOOKALIKE CONTEST."

31:25.121 --> 31:26.354
AND THE THING IS, THERE ACTUALLY

31:26.423 --> 31:27.622
HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF

31:27.691 --> 31:28.623
VOTE-STUFFING SCANDALS OVER THE

31:28.692 --> 31:30.291
YEARS.

31:30.360 --> 31:32.927
IN 2015, TWO 15-YEAR-OLD TWINS

31:32.996 --> 31:35.129
USED THEIR PARENTS' BUSINESS

31:35.198 --> 31:36.697
EMAIL ACCOUNT TO MAKE HUNDREDS

31:36.766 --> 31:38.966
OF FAKE EMAILS, TO VOTE OVER 200

31:39.035 --> 31:39.534
TIMES FOR THE KOKAKO -- THIS

31:39.603 --> 31:42.069
BLUE THING.

31:42.138 --> 31:43.271
THEN, TWO YEARS LATER, ANOTHER

31:43.340 --> 31:45.306
VOTER FRAUD ATTEMPT WAS

31:45.375 --> 31:46.007
DISCOVERED WHEN OVER A HUNDRED

31:46.076 --> 31:47.608
FRAUDULENT VOTES WERE CAST FOR

31:47.677 --> 31:48.876
THE WHITE-FACED HERON --

31:48.945 --> 31:50.144
SOMETHING FOREST & BIRD TOOK IN

31:50.213 --> 31:51.412
STRIDE, SAYING: "WE'RE NOT MAD,

31:51.481 --> 31:53.047
JUST IMPRESSED THAT SOMEONE

31:53.116 --> 31:54.382
CARES ENOUGH ABOUT NEW ZEALAND'S

31:54.451 --> 31:54.882
NATIVE BIRDS TO RIG THE

31:54.951 --> 31:57.151
COMPETITION."

31:57.220 --> 32:04.091
AND I'M GLAD THEY WEREN'T MAD

32:04.160 --> 32:04.525
BUT I DEFINITELY AM.

32:04.594 --> 32:05.059
BECAUSE THIS FUCKING THING

32:05.128 --> 32:05.660
DOESN'T DESERVE TO BE ANYWHERE

32:05.729 --> 32:06.861
NEAR THE BIRD OF THE YEAR AWARD.

32:06.930 --> 32:07.428
IT LOOKS LIKE A PIGEON TOOK

32:07.497 --> 32:10.465
ANABOLIC STEROIDS.

32:10.534 --> 32:11.299
I HATE THIS BIRD!

32:11.368 --> 32:11.933
BUT THIS ALL SPEAKS TO HOW MUCH

32:12.002 --> 32:12.467
THE PEOPLE OF NEW ZEALAND

32:12.536 --> 32:13.801
JUSTIFIABLY LOVE THIS

32:13.870 --> 32:14.102
COMPETITION.

32:14.171 --> 32:14.735
THERE ARE CAMPAIGN MANAGERS FOR

32:14.804 --> 32:16.704
EACH BIRD CANDIDATE, AND THE

32:16.773 --> 32:20.541
ELECTIONEERING CAN BE INTENSE.

32:20.610 --> 32:21.142
IN 2019, THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE

32:21.211 --> 32:23.411
ROCKHOPPER CREATED A SERIES OF

32:23.480 --> 32:25.012
MOVIE PARODY POSTERS, INCLUDING

32:25.081 --> 32:26.814
"ROCKY HOPPER PICTURE SHOW" AND

32:26.883 --> 32:28.716
"SCHOOL OF ROCKHOPPER."

32:28.785 --> 32:29.183
WHICH ARE BOTH CLEARLY

32:29.252 --> 32:30.084
EXCELLENT.

32:30.153 --> 32:32.053
BUT MY FAVORITE ENDORSEMENT CAME

32:32.122 --> 32:33.087
FROM ADULT TOY MEGASTORE -- AN

32:33.156 --> 32:35.356
ONLINE RETAILER WHICH CAMPAIGNED

32:35.425 --> 32:36.657
FOR THE HIHI BIRD, CLAIMING THAT

32:36.726 --> 32:38.326
THE "MALE HIHI HAVE THE LARGEST

32:38.395 --> 32:40.795
TESTICLES IN THE BIRD WORLD" AND

32:40.864 --> 32:45.099
"THE HIHI IS THE SEX-POSITIVE

32:45.168 --> 32:45.666
POLYAMOROUS IDOL OF THE BIRD

32:45.735 --> 32:46.300
WORLD WITH THE BIGGEST BALLS TO

32:46.369 --> 32:47.668
BOOT."

32:47.737 --> 32:48.369
THERE ARE EVEN HONEST-TO-GOD

32:48.438 --> 32:50.171
BIRD OF THE YEAR DEBATES, WHERE

32:50.240 --> 32:51.305
CAMPAIGNERS FACE OFF AGAINST

32:51.374 --> 32:52.640
EACH OTHER.

32:52.709 --> 32:53.274
>> I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO YOUR

32:53.343 --> 32:55.877
BEST IMPRESSION OF YOUR BIRD'S

32:55.946 --> 32:56.778
CALL.

32:56.847 --> 32:57.779
SO, WE'RE GONNA START WITH

32:57.848 --> 32:58.913
FRANCES.

32:58.982 --> 33:01.349
GOOD LUCK.

33:01.418 --> 33:01.949
>> REEEEH!

33:02.018 --> 33:03.384
REEEEEEH!

33:03.453 --> 33:04.018
>> EE EE EE EE EE EE EE EE EE EE

33:04.087 --> 33:04.485
EE!

33:07.257 --> 33:08.122

33:09.159 --> 33:10.825

33:10.894 --> 33:13.795

33:13.864 --> 33:14.629

33:14.698 --> 33:15.763
NEW ZEALAND RADIO!

33:15.832 --> 33:16.998
AND JUST IMAGINE TURNING THAT

33:17.067 --> 33:17.899
DEBATE ON MIDWAY THROUGH,

33:17.968 --> 33:20.535
WITHOUT HEARING THE QUESTION.

33:20.604 --> 33:22.203
IT'D SOUND LIKE YOU'RE LISTENING

33:22.272 --> 33:28.943
TO AN ORGY OF HAUNTED DOLLS.

33:29.012 --> 33:29.610
NOW, AT THIS POINT, YOU MIGHT BE

33:29.679 --> 33:30.645
THINKING, "WOW, I WISH THERE WAS

33:30.714 --> 33:32.613
A BIRD OF THE YEAR COMPETITION

33:32.682 --> 33:33.948
THIS SPECTACULAR HERE IN THE

33:34.017 --> 33:34.549
U.S. THAT WE COULD PARTICIPATE

33:34.618 --> 33:35.783
IN."

33:35.852 --> 33:37.251
AND WELL, I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS AND

33:37.320 --> 33:39.120
BAD NEWS.

33:39.189 --> 33:41.022
THE BAD NEWS IS: THERE ISN'T.

33:41.091 --> 33:42.590
THE GOOD NEWS IS: NEW ZEALAND'S

33:42.659 --> 33:44.258
CONTEST IS NOT ACTUALLY

33:44.327 --> 33:46.761
RESTRICTED TO JUST NEW ZEALAND.

33:46.830 --> 33:47.829
ANYONE IN THE WORLD CAN VOTE, AS

33:47.898 --> 33:49.263
LONG AS THEY HAVE A VALID EMAIL.

33:49.332 --> 33:50.264
AND NOT JUST THAT.

33:50.333 --> 33:51.566
FOREST & BIRD THEMSELVES SAY

33:51.635 --> 33:53.000
THEY "ENCOURAGE ANYONE WHO IS

33:53.069 --> 33:54.168
PASSIONATE ABOUT THEIR FAVORITE

33:54.237 --> 33:55.837
NATIVE BIRD TO CAMPAIGN

33:55.906 --> 33:57.371
THROUGHOUT THE COMPETITION."

33:57.440 --> 33:58.473
AND BY NOW, I'M PRETTY SURE YOU

33:58.542 --> 34:00.842
KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING.

34:00.911 --> 34:01.909
BECAUSE WE ARE HEREBY ANNOUNCING

34:01.978 --> 34:03.478
OURSELVES AS THE OFFICIAL

34:03.547 --> 34:04.645
CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR WHAT WE

34:04.714 --> 34:06.214
BELIEVE TO BE THE BEST CANDIDATE

34:06.283 --> 34:07.582
FOR NEW ZEALAND'S BIRD OF THE

34:07.651 --> 34:08.850
CENTURY.

34:08.919 --> 34:12.720
I'M TALKING, OF COURSE, ABOUT

34:12.789 --> 34:13.754
THE PUTEKETEKE, ALSO KNOWN AS

34:13.823 --> 34:14.589
THE AUSTRALASIAN CRESTED GREBE.

34:14.658 --> 34:17.325
LOOK AT THIS BEAUTY!

34:17.394 --> 34:17.925
IT LOOKS LIKE PAULY D FUCKED A

34:17.994 --> 34:20.128
SWAN.

34:20.197 --> 34:22.163
EVEN ITS NAME IS EVEN FUN TO

34:22.232 --> 34:23.131
SAY.

34:23.200 --> 34:24.799
PUTEKETEKE.

34:24.868 --> 34:25.700
PUTEKETEKE.

34:25.769 --> 34:26.367
IT FEELS LIKE YOUR TONGUE IS

34:26.436 --> 34:28.336
TAP-DANCING.

34:28.405 --> 34:29.303
AND THERE ARE SO MANY FUN FACTS

34:29.372 --> 34:29.871
ABOUT IT, LIKE THE FACT THAT

34:29.940 --> 34:31.038
THEY'RE KNOWN FOR CARRYING THEIR

34:31.107 --> 34:32.940
BABIES ON THEIR BACKS LIKE THIS,

34:33.009 --> 34:34.308
WHICH, YES, IS ADORABLE.

34:34.377 --> 34:35.643
AND BOTH PARENTS WILL INCUBATE

34:35.712 --> 34:37.612
THE EGGS AND TEND TO THE CHICKS.

34:37.681 --> 34:38.212
THEY GIVE EACH OTHER SPACE TO

34:38.281 --> 34:39.247
CO-PARENT.

34:39.316 --> 34:40.148
THEY DON'T STIFLE EACH OTHER,

34:40.217 --> 34:41.182
YOU KNOW?

34:41.251 --> 34:41.949
AND YOU WANT ELEGANCE?

34:42.018 --> 34:44.418
I'LL GIVE YOU ELEGANCE.

34:44.487 --> 34:46.087
THEY HAVE A MATING DANCE WHERE

34:46.156 --> 34:47.622
THEY BOTH GRAB A CLUMP OF WET

34:47.691 --> 34:49.290
GRASS AND CHEST-BUMP EACH OTHER,

34:49.359 --> 34:50.424
BEFORE STANDING AROUND, UNSURE

34:50.493 --> 34:53.127
OF WHAT TO DO NEXT.

34:53.196 --> 34:55.263
I HAVE NEVER IDENTIFIED WITH

34:55.332 --> 34:56.764
ANYTHING MORE IN MY FUCKING

34:56.833 --> 35:01.469
LIFE.

35:01.538 --> 35:02.336
[LAUGHTER AND CHEERING]

35:02.405 --> 35:03.404
PUTEKETEKES ALSO -- AND THIS IS

35:03.473 --> 35:04.005
TRUE -- EAT THEIR OWN FEATHERS

35:04.074 --> 35:05.072
BY THE HUNDREDS TO PROTECT THEIR

35:05.141 --> 35:06.140
STOMACHS DURING DIGESTION, AND

35:06.209 --> 35:08.676
THEN WILL THROW UP A BALL OF

35:08.745 --> 35:10.611
FEATHERS AND FISH BONES.

35:10.680 --> 35:11.846
THEY'RE WEIRD PUKING BIRDS WITH

35:11.915 --> 35:13.114
COLORFUL MULLETS!

35:13.183 --> 35:14.515
WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE HERE?

35:14.584 --> 35:15.750
AND THERE'S ANOTHER REASON THAT

35:15.819 --> 35:16.984
YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR THE

35:17.053 --> 35:18.953
PUTEKETEKE, AND THAT'S THAT ITS

35:19.022 --> 35:19.787
EXISTENCE IS UNDER THREAT.

35:19.856 --> 35:21.589
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT ITS NEW

35:21.658 --> 35:22.223
ZEALAND POPULATION NUMBERS FEWER

35:22.292 --> 35:23.691
THAN 1,000 BIRDS.

35:23.760 --> 35:25.693
AND YET, TRAGICALLY, IT'S NEVER

35:25.762 --> 35:27.795
WON BIRD OF THE YEAR BEFORE.

35:27.864 --> 35:28.996
ALTHOUGH, TO BE HONEST, IT'S

35:29.065 --> 35:30.465
ALSO NEVER HAD US CAMPAIGNING

35:30.534 --> 35:32.366
FOR IT BEFORE, HAS IT?

35:32.435 --> 35:34.302
AND I DO THINK WE CAN DO THIS.

35:34.371 --> 35:35.770
LAST YEAR, WHEN THE ROCK WREN

35:35.839 --> 35:38.406
WON, IT DID SO WITH 2,894 NUMBER

35:38.475 --> 35:39.040
ONE VOTES, SO I'M PRETTY SURE WE

35:39.109 --> 35:42.977
CAN BEAT.

35:43.046 --> 35:43.644
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE'VE PUT

35:43.713 --> 35:45.079
TOGETHER A CAMPAIGN WHICH COULD

35:45.148 --> 35:46.314
REASONABLY BE DESCRIBED AS

35:46.383 --> 35:50.051
"ALARMINGLY AGGRESSIVE."

35:50.120 --> 35:51.385
FIRST, WE PUT UP ADS IN

35:51.454 --> 35:53.087
NEW ZEALAND PROMOTING THE

35:53.156 --> 35:54.722
PUTEKETEKE AS

35:54.791 --> 35:56.424
"THE LORD OF THE WINGS," WHICH

35:56.493 --> 36:00.361
IS ALREADY VERY EXCITING.

36:00.430 --> 36:00.995
BUT LOOK, WE DIDN'T STOP THERE.

36:01.064 --> 36:01.629
BECAUSE REMEMBER, THE POTENTIAL

36:01.698 --> 36:02.430
VOTERS ARE EVERY SINGLE

36:02.499 --> 36:03.498
INHABITANT OF EARTH.

36:03.567 --> 36:04.765
SO FOR THE LAST WEEK, THERE'S

36:04.834 --> 36:06.033
ALSO BEEN A BUNCH OF BILLBOARDS

36:06.102 --> 36:06.601
UP IN THE CENTER OF MUMBAI,

36:06.670 --> 36:08.169
INDIA.

36:08.238 --> 36:09.504
LOOK AT THEM!

36:09.573 --> 36:10.538
THERE THEY ARE!

36:10.607 --> 36:11.806
A CITY OF OVER 12 MILLION PEOPLE

36:11.875 --> 36:12.373
-- THAT'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL

36:12.442 --> 36:14.041
VOTES RIGHT THERE.

36:14.110 --> 36:21.110
WE ALSO DESIGNED THIS STRIKING

36:23.253 --> 36:23.751
ANIMATED AD IN JAPAN, IN THE

36:23.820 --> 36:24.252
CENTER OF TOKYO, IN THE

36:24.321 --> 36:24.852
SO-CALLED "BUSIEST CROSSING IN

36:24.921 --> 36:25.453
THE WORLD," SO HOPEFULLY THAT

36:25.522 --> 36:26.020
SHOULD BRING IN A FEW VOTES,

36:26.089 --> 36:27.021
TOO.

36:27.090 --> 36:28.189
NOW, WE TRIED TO GET THIS POSTER

36:28.258 --> 36:29.757
PUT UP IN PARIS, BUT THEY

36:29.826 --> 36:31.192
WOULDN'T DO IT, BECAUSE THE BIRD

36:31.261 --> 36:33.728
WAS SMOKING, AND APPARENTLY

36:33.797 --> 36:35.163
CIGARETTES ARE APPARENTLY BANNED

36:35.232 --> 36:35.897
IN ADVERTISING THERE, WHICH

36:35.966 --> 36:36.998
SEEMS RIDICULOUS, CONSIDERING

36:37.067 --> 36:37.632
THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF FRANCE

36:37.701 --> 36:41.035
SMOKES.

36:41.104 --> 36:42.069
SO WE RELUCTANTLY TWEAKED IT AND

36:42.138 --> 36:44.572
PUT THIS NON-SMOKING VERSION UP

36:44.641 --> 36:46.808
ON THE CHAMPS D'ELYSEE, RIGHT

36:46.877 --> 36:48.042
NEXT TO THE ARC DE TRIOMPHE,

36:48.111 --> 36:48.776
WHICH HAS FRANKLY NEVER LOOKED

36:48.845 --> 36:50.111
BETTER.

36:50.180 --> 36:51.846
MEANWHILE, IN LONDON, WE MADE

36:51.915 --> 36:53.214
THIS MOBILE AD TELLING EVERYONE

36:53.283 --> 36:54.816
THERE TO "HELP US CROWN A REAL

36:54.885 --> 36:57.952

36:58.021 --> 36:59.554
THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AND ALL

36:59.623 --> 37:00.288
AROUND THE CITY.

37:00.357 --> 37:01.389
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "THAT'S

37:01.458 --> 37:01.956
GREAT, JOHN, BUT WHAT ABOUT

37:02.025 --> 37:02.423
BRAZIL?

37:02.492 --> 37:03.458

37:17.908 --> 37:19.107

37:19.176 --> 37:21.075

37:21.144 --> 37:21.642
THIS BILLBOARD IN MANITOWOC,

37:21.711 --> 37:24.312
WISCONSIN.

37:24.381 --> 37:24.946
BECAUSE HEY, NOT EVERYONE LIVES

37:25.015 --> 37:25.580

37:25.649 --> 37:26.781
AND IF YOU LIVE IN MANITOWOC, WE

37:26.850 --> 37:28.349
NEED YOUR SUPPORT, TOO.

37:28.418 --> 37:28.950
