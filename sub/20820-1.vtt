[♪♪♪]

01:02.631 --> 01:04.063
What is your problem?

01:04.065 --> 01:05.465
You don't have
to push me like that.

01:05.467 --> 01:06.500
My problem is you.

01:06.502 --> 01:07.601
You can't keep
your mouth shut.

01:07.603 --> 01:09.269
What'd I say?
I didn't say anything.

01:09.271 --> 01:10.771
Right! Flashing all
the cash in your wallet

01:10.773 --> 01:11.905
isn't saying anything?

01:11.907 --> 01:13.307
I wanted to buy
some girls some drinks.

01:13.309 --> 01:15.041
You don't need to be
buying people drinks.

01:15.043 --> 01:16.276
You're going
to get us caught.

01:16.278 --> 01:17.877
Will you stop? You're
so uptight lately.

01:17.879 --> 01:19.446
I should've never
gotten you involved.

01:19.448 --> 01:21.047
You can't
keep it together.

01:21.049 --> 01:23.149
I've got a lot
on the line here.

01:23.151 --> 01:24.217
You know what?

01:24.219 --> 01:25.452
I'm gonna buy you
a drink next time,

01:25.454 --> 01:27.053
so you can relax and
realize that nothing is--

01:27.055 --> 01:28.955
We've been I.D.ed.

01:33.829 --> 01:37.664
[♪♪♪]

02:01.457 --> 02:02.823
You are gonna love
this book.

02:02.825 --> 02:06.660
I stayed up half the night
to finish it when I read it.

02:06.662 --> 02:07.961
Okay, Lillian.

02:07.963 --> 02:09.229
I'm heading out.

02:09.231 --> 02:11.498
You still have three minutes
on your shift.

02:11.500 --> 02:14.267
Oh, well, maybe you could
spot me a minute or two.

02:14.269 --> 02:16.002
Mother's throwing
John Queensland

02:16.004 --> 02:17.337
a birthday party tonight.

02:17.339 --> 02:18.805
Yes, I heard.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.476
You know, if you're up
for a party,

02:22.478 --> 02:23.510
you're welcome to come.

02:23.512 --> 02:25.512
Oh, I'm sure "welcome"
is a strong word.

02:25.514 --> 02:27.581
No, it's
the right word.

02:27.583 --> 02:29.349
We would love to have you.

02:29.351 --> 02:31.084
I almost believe you.

02:31.086 --> 02:33.953
But I'm sure
the party will be thick

02:33.955 --> 02:36.222
with your morbid
"Real Murders Club" people.

02:36.224 --> 02:38.157
Yes, there will be
some of us there.

02:38.159 --> 02:39.893
I'll think about it,

02:39.895 --> 02:41.695
but don't get
your hopes up.

02:41.697 --> 02:44.197
I won't.

02:44.199 --> 02:45.198
[cell phone ringing]

02:46.835 --> 02:49.302
Martin.
How's your day going?

02:49.304 --> 02:50.537
It's about
to get a whole lot better.

02:50.539 --> 02:51.772
<i>Why is that?</i>

02:51.774 --> 02:54.474
Because I am leaving work
and heading to see you!

02:54.476 --> 02:57.043
<i>Aww! I can't wait</i>
<i>to see you, too.</i>

02:57.045 --> 02:58.412
Hey! Will you make a detour,

02:58.414 --> 02:59.946
and pick up a bottle of
champagne for the party?

02:59.948 --> 03:01.014
<i>Okay.</i>

03:01.016 --> 03:04.017
See you soon.
Bottle of bubbly in hand.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.488
[knocking on door]

03:13.128 --> 03:13.927
Hi!

03:13.929 --> 03:15.495
Can I help you?

03:15.497 --> 03:16.763
I hope
you're Aurora Teagarden

03:16.765 --> 03:17.898
and I'm in the right place.

03:17.900 --> 03:19.399
Yeah, that's me.

03:19.401 --> 03:21.000
I don't think
I know you, though.

03:21.002 --> 03:22.969
No, but you know
my uncle Martin.

03:22.971 --> 03:24.938
I just went by his office
and they said

03:24.940 --> 03:26.306
he'd left to come here,
so...

03:26.308 --> 03:27.140
I'm Regina.

03:28.276 --> 03:29.576
Regina...

03:29.578 --> 03:31.745
Oh! Regina!

03:31.747 --> 03:32.846
Yes!

03:32.848 --> 03:34.714
I've seen your pictures
on Martin's wall.

03:34.716 --> 03:36.616
Yeah, he's told me about you.
Please come in.

03:36.618 --> 03:37.484
Thank you.

03:39.721 --> 03:42.088
He hasn't seen you
in a few years.

03:42.090 --> 03:44.524
He said you lost touch
after your mother died.

03:44.526 --> 03:47.494
Oh. Yeah, I just...
I couldn't do family for awhile.

03:47.496 --> 03:49.996
He probably doesn't even
know I got married.

03:49.998 --> 03:52.632
Oh. Or had a baby!

03:52.634 --> 03:54.668
Yes, I did.

03:54.670 --> 03:56.402
This is Hayden.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.371
Beautiful little Hayden.

03:58.373 --> 04:00.106
Oh, hi, Hayden!

04:00.108 --> 04:03.977
Aw, he is beautiful.
And so little!

04:03.979 --> 04:06.880
He's just two weeks.

04:06.882 --> 04:07.914
And suddenly, I just had
to show him off

04:07.916 --> 04:08.782
to my uncle Martin.

04:10.085 --> 04:12.385
He is coming here, right?

04:12.387 --> 04:13.954
Oh, any minute.

04:13.956 --> 04:14.788
Oh.

04:14.790 --> 04:16.857
Yeah.
Please sit down.

04:23.298 --> 04:24.498
Here you go.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.366
Oh, thanks.

04:28.704 --> 04:30.003
Here you go.

04:31.607 --> 04:32.906
Look at him go!

04:32.908 --> 04:35.008
He must be hungry.

04:35.010 --> 04:36.342
I haven't had
a chance to feed him

04:36.344 --> 04:37.611
since we left Corinth.

04:37.613 --> 04:38.712
That's where I live now.

04:38.714 --> 04:40.079
Oh, Corinth?

04:40.081 --> 04:41.615
That's only an hour away.

04:41.617 --> 04:42.883
I don't think Martin knew
you lived so close.

04:42.885 --> 04:45.151
Oh, we just moved there
four months ago.

04:45.153 --> 04:46.452
Me and Craig.
That's my husband.

04:46.454 --> 04:47.453
Oh.

04:47.455 --> 04:48.822
His grandparents
actually live there,

04:48.824 --> 04:49.723
so they helped us get a place.

04:51.760 --> 04:54.628
I've been meaning to drive out
and surprise Uncle Martin,

04:54.630 --> 04:56.530
but my pregnancy
was a little rough, so...

04:56.532 --> 04:57.998
Oh.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.099
-[door opens]
-Aurora? It's me!

05:00.101 --> 05:01.434
In the kitchen!

05:01.436 --> 05:04.303
Any idea whose red car
that is in the drive...

05:05.473 --> 05:06.740
Hi, Uncle Martin.

05:06.742 --> 05:08.642
Regina?

05:08.644 --> 05:10.410
Y-- And son.

05:10.412 --> 05:12.812
And son?

05:12.814 --> 05:14.614
[laughs]
Well, hi!

05:14.616 --> 05:16.416
Hi!

05:16.418 --> 05:17.651
Wow.

05:19.021 --> 05:21.755
I can definitely
see your mother in him.

05:21.757 --> 05:23.489
His eyes, huh?

05:23.491 --> 05:27.060
But his mouth and his chin
and everything is all Craig.

05:27.062 --> 05:28.261
That's my husband.

05:28.263 --> 05:30.063
See?

05:30.065 --> 05:31.898
That's our wedding photo.

05:34.269 --> 05:36.202
Isn't he handsome?

05:36.204 --> 05:37.403
Oh, yes!

05:37.405 --> 05:39.639
And where is
this husband of yours?

05:39.641 --> 05:41.374
Oh. He had to go
out of town on a job,

05:41.376 --> 05:42.475
so he couldn't come.

05:42.477 --> 05:44.343
Job doing what?

05:44.345 --> 05:46.179
Construction stuff.

05:48.016 --> 05:49.883
Well, I hope he's good enough
for you.

05:49.885 --> 05:52.185
He's very sweet,
and he loves me.

05:52.187 --> 05:54.153
you probably wouldn't
like him, though.

05:54.155 --> 05:55.455
Why do you say that?

05:55.457 --> 05:57.757
Because. You're always
so suspicious of everybody.

05:57.759 --> 05:58.959
Ah. [chuckles]

05:58.961 --> 06:00.226
She knows you well.

06:00.228 --> 06:02.996
Do I have reason to be
suspicious of the guy?

06:02.998 --> 06:04.998
I mean, I want
to know everything.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.767
You know, where you've been
for the past four years,

06:07.769 --> 06:09.402
why you lived
just an hour away

06:09.404 --> 06:10.770
and didn't tell me.

06:10.772 --> 06:13.339
Well, maybe if you didn't
grill her like a suspect...

06:13.341 --> 06:14.774
Okay, I will
tell you everything

06:14.776 --> 06:16.643
eventually, I promise.

06:16.645 --> 06:18.612
After all, I'll be...

06:18.614 --> 06:19.946
staying with you
a couple days.

06:21.683 --> 06:23.083
Staying with me?

06:23.085 --> 06:24.818
Well, only if it's all right.
I don't--

06:24.820 --> 06:26.786
Well, yeah! Yeah, of course.
Of course.

06:26.788 --> 06:28.722
I'll, uh...

06:28.724 --> 06:30.156
I'll have to drag
an air mattress

06:30.158 --> 06:31.557
out of the garage.

06:31.559 --> 06:32.692
Um, I've had a crew
in there,

06:32.694 --> 06:33.994
doing renovations--

06:33.996 --> 06:35.862
You know what, Regina?
Why don't you just stay with me?

06:35.864 --> 06:37.163
I have plenty of room.

06:37.165 --> 06:38.231
[Regina]: Really?

06:38.233 --> 06:39.699
I would love that.
Thank you.

06:39.701 --> 06:40.700
Yeah. I'll show you
the guest room.

06:40.702 --> 06:42.502
Okay.

06:42.504 --> 06:44.137
And Martin, I'm sure my mother
will understand

06:44.139 --> 06:45.805
if you want to skip the party
and visit with your niece.

06:45.807 --> 06:47.073
Oh, no, no, no, no.

06:47.075 --> 06:49.442
No, do not change your plans
because of me. Honestly.

06:49.444 --> 06:51.678
Hayden and I are super-tired
anyways, so,

06:51.680 --> 06:53.346
we're probably just gonna
take a nap.

06:53.348 --> 06:54.313
Well...

06:54.315 --> 06:55.381
Honestly, Uncle Martin.

06:55.383 --> 06:57.784
It's fine.
We'll be okay. Go!

06:59.021 --> 07:01.320
Okay. Okay.

07:01.322 --> 07:03.757
Party it is.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.793
[background chatter
and buzz]

07:06.795 --> 07:08.327
-Hello.
-Hi!

07:09.464 --> 07:11.430
Mm! Smells good in here.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.199
Oh, that's because
Doreen May is catering.

07:13.201 --> 07:15.001
And Martin...

07:15.003 --> 07:17.070
You look so dapper!

07:17.072 --> 07:19.706
Aida, radiant, as always.

07:19.708 --> 07:20.740
Thank you.

07:20.742 --> 07:22.709
Where's the birthday boy?

07:22.711 --> 07:23.843
Oh! His favorite.

07:23.845 --> 07:25.545
He's in the other room,
chatting.

07:26.948 --> 07:29.849
There is a little group
of your Real Murders Club here,

07:29.851 --> 07:31.484
and I want you
to promise me

07:31.486 --> 07:33.452
that there'll be no talk
about murder cases.

07:33.454 --> 07:34.587
[Aida snaps
to cut her off]

07:34.589 --> 07:36.056
Not a peep.

07:38.493 --> 07:40.359
[sweetly]: Come in.

07:47.035 --> 07:48.401
It's a great turnout, John.

07:48.403 --> 07:49.569
I don't know
if it's for me,

07:49.571 --> 07:51.604
or because no one throws
a party like your mother.

07:51.606 --> 07:53.573
[Sally]:
Mm! Tell me about it.

07:53.575 --> 07:55.208
These crab cakes taste so good,

07:55.210 --> 07:56.743
I'm embarrassed
by how many I've eaten.

07:56.745 --> 07:59.312
I actually stuffed a few
in my pocket for later.

07:59.314 --> 08:00.313
Your pocket?

08:00.315 --> 08:01.380
Mm-hmm.

08:01.382 --> 08:03.316
Um, Wait a minute.
Who-- Who are you?

08:03.318 --> 08:04.918
I'm Jason Dell.

08:06.454 --> 08:08.722
Wait, Dell,
as in Perry Dell?

08:08.724 --> 08:09.689
Yeah!

08:09.691 --> 08:11.057
Yeah, he's my cousin.

08:11.059 --> 08:12.025
Where is Perry?

08:12.027 --> 08:13.159
He's out of town.

08:13.161 --> 08:14.694
But he said
you Real Murders Club people

08:14.696 --> 08:16.229
have great meetings
and good food,

08:16.231 --> 08:17.897
so thought
I'd check it one out.

08:17.899 --> 08:19.099
But this isn't
actually a meeting.

08:19.101 --> 08:20.233
That reminds me,

08:20.235 --> 08:21.534
I have a question about

08:21.536 --> 08:23.069
the talk you gave
to the club, John.

08:23.071 --> 08:25.205
The Madeleine Smith case?
Arsenic poisoning?

08:25.207 --> 08:26.873
Cool.

08:26.875 --> 08:29.508
[John]: We were thrilled to have
you join the club, Madame Mayor.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.277
Just "Terry" is fine when
I'm not on official business.

08:31.279 --> 08:32.477
[John]: "Terry" it is.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.080
[Terry]: What's your theory

08:34.082 --> 08:36.750
about how
Madeleine disguised the taste?

08:36.751 --> 08:38.051
You know,
I saw the weather report.

08:38.053 --> 08:40.153
This weekend,
I heard it's gonna rain.

08:40.155 --> 08:41.921
Did anyone else hear that?

08:44.359 --> 08:47.326
[awkward silence
over background chatter]

08:51.867 --> 08:53.032
Hey, Arthur!

08:53.034 --> 08:55.568
I hear you got moved from
Robbery to Homicide

08:55.570 --> 08:58.204
now that your lovely wife
is the new Chief.

08:58.206 --> 09:00.974
Yep. Here's hoping
I'll be bored for awhile.

09:00.976 --> 09:03.276
O-Or not.

09:05.113 --> 09:07.113
Lynn, you look so nice.

09:07.115 --> 09:09.249
Well, I understand
it's customary

09:09.251 --> 09:11.184
to dress up for a party.

09:13.822 --> 09:15.855
Must be nice
to have a date night.

09:15.857 --> 09:18.224
Yeah, a little
"Mommy free-time."

09:18.226 --> 09:19.659
Yeah, actually, it is.

09:19.661 --> 09:22.662
Almost makes it worth
the awkward conversations.

09:22.664 --> 09:23.629
[quiet sigh]

09:23.631 --> 09:24.664
Kind of like this one.

09:26.601 --> 09:28.268
Lynn, I keep thinking

09:28.270 --> 09:31.370
you and I, we're eventually
going to be friends.

09:31.372 --> 09:32.806
I'm sure we will.

09:33.942 --> 09:36.209
Any time now.

09:37.913 --> 09:39.879
She really does like you.

09:41.683 --> 09:43.416
I'm sure she does.

09:45.921 --> 09:47.821
[smooch]

09:47.823 --> 09:49.755
I'm gonna check
on the birthday boy.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.357
Hey, Martin!

09:51.359 --> 09:53.126
Hey! How's
my favorite reporter?

09:53.128 --> 09:54.260
Oh, good. Thanks.

09:54.262 --> 09:55.561
Good! Good!

09:55.563 --> 09:58.031
Martin seems
to be in high spirits.

09:58.033 --> 09:59.632
Yeah, well,
his long-lost niece, Regina,

09:59.634 --> 10:00.599
showed up tonight,

10:00.601 --> 10:01.667
with a baby.

10:01.669 --> 10:02.902
"Long-lost?"

10:02.904 --> 10:05.138
Well, Martin's sister
died a few years back,

10:05.140 --> 10:07.173
and-and her daughter,
she just disappeared,

10:07.175 --> 10:08.908
stopped returning phone calls,

10:08.910 --> 10:10.977
and they kind of
lost track of her.

10:10.979 --> 10:13.046
But Martin's ex-C.I.A.
Couldn't he have found her?

10:13.048 --> 10:14.848
He wanted to give her space.

10:14.850 --> 10:18.084
But, really, I think he just
felt stung that she pulled away,

10:18.086 --> 10:20.320
which is why he's in
such a good mood tonight.

10:20.322 --> 10:22.355
Oh! I love a happy ending.

10:22.357 --> 10:23.156
Yeah.

10:41.977 --> 10:43.542
Craig! Rory!

10:43.544 --> 10:45.745
[exhales]
Where have you been?

10:45.747 --> 10:47.313
We left as soon
as we got out.

10:47.315 --> 10:48.748
Shh! The baby's upstairs,
sleeping.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.383
Okay, sorry.

10:53.355 --> 10:55.054
Everything go okay?

10:55.056 --> 10:56.822
-How's the baby?
-He's fine...

10:56.824 --> 10:58.358
...but I'm really worried.
What if they--

10:58.360 --> 10:59.392
They won't. I promise.

10:59.394 --> 11:02.262
-[car approaches]
-Dude--

11:02.264 --> 11:03.596
Tell me you didn't.

11:03.598 --> 11:04.663
I didn't!
I didn't! I swear.

11:04.665 --> 11:05.932
We've got
to get out of here now.

11:07.402 --> 11:09.769
-It's too late.
-It's not.

11:11.106 --> 11:13.439
[♪♪♪]

11:13.441 --> 11:14.307
They're here.

11:19.014 --> 11:20.213
[John]: I'm gonna see
how much birthday magic

11:20.215 --> 11:21.614
I can squeeze out of the day.

11:21.616 --> 11:23.983
I plan to propose
to Aida again.

11:23.985 --> 11:26.085
Ho-ho!
You are a persistent man.

11:26.087 --> 11:27.353
How many times
will that be?

11:27.355 --> 11:28.621
Four.

11:28.623 --> 11:30.723
Well, five, if you count
the time I did it by email.

11:30.725 --> 11:32.358
But tonight,

11:32.360 --> 11:35.028
it'll be roses, champagne,
and back down on one knee.

11:35.030 --> 11:37.363
I should've bought you
knee pads for your birthday.

11:37.365 --> 11:39.365
You should
get some for yourself.

11:39.367 --> 11:41.434
Teagarden women don't like
to give up their independence.

11:41.436 --> 11:43.436
If you want
Roe to marry you,

11:43.438 --> 11:45.939
then you might
want to get started.

11:45.941 --> 11:48.741
[laughing]

11:48.743 --> 11:50.876
Well, you gentlemen seem
to be enjoying one other.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.711
Oh, it's
the latest meeting

11:52.713 --> 11:54.880
of the "Teagarden
Women Fan Club."

11:54.882 --> 11:57.716
Oh! Well, thank you.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.118
Are you having fun?

11:59.120 --> 12:01.354
I'm having a fabulous time.
Thank you.

12:01.356 --> 12:03.556
[♪♪♪]

12:06.794 --> 12:08.727
Thanks for inviting
Regina to stay.

12:08.729 --> 12:11.230
Oh, you seemed
so happy to see her.

12:11.232 --> 12:12.932
Oh, I am. I am.

12:12.934 --> 12:14.434
She was always
such a great kid.

12:14.436 --> 12:16.869
She's the one
who made me look forward

12:16.871 --> 12:18.771
to being a dad someday.

12:21.276 --> 12:24.577
We've never really had
the "kid" talk yet,

12:24.579 --> 12:25.811
have we?

12:25.813 --> 12:27.280
[stammers]

12:27.282 --> 12:29.849
I always assumed
I would have kids.

12:29.851 --> 12:31.184
Someday.

12:31.186 --> 12:32.285
Hey!

12:32.287 --> 12:35.088
Wasn't Regina
driving a red car?

12:35.090 --> 12:36.722
Yes, she was.

12:36.724 --> 12:38.958
I'm gonna go see
if Regina and the baby

12:38.960 --> 12:41.094
are still in the house.

12:43.198 --> 12:45.465
[♪♪♪]

12:48.970 --> 12:50.169
[gasps]

12:50.171 --> 12:51.104
Martin!

12:58.980 --> 13:00.013
What the...?

13:01.682 --> 13:06.185
It looks like the man
in the picture Regina showed us.

13:06.187 --> 13:08.721
I think
that's her husband...

13:08.723 --> 13:09.955
-I think he's dead.
-Regina!

13:12.527 --> 13:14.427
[Martin, shouting]:
Regina? Regina!

13:30.111 --> 13:31.310
Her bag's still here,

13:31.312 --> 13:33.146
but Regina
and the baby are gone.

13:33.148 --> 13:35.048
They could've
been abducted.

13:35.050 --> 13:37.083
Or, if they got into a fight,
maybe she killed him.

13:37.085 --> 13:38.484
I'm calling the police.

13:38.486 --> 13:41.087
Wait, wait, wait.
Let me think.

13:41.089 --> 13:42.355
Martin.

13:42.357 --> 13:44.823
Whatever happened to Regina,
we have to find her.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.059
She's in trouble.

13:48.163 --> 13:49.462
You're right.

13:49.464 --> 13:51.497
You're right.
Call them.

13:54.402 --> 13:57.236
[radio crackling indistinctly]

14:02.510 --> 14:04.944
Lynn, would you like
some tea or coffee?

14:04.946 --> 14:05.911
No, thank you.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.846
I am curious, though,

14:07.848 --> 14:10.283
if you think it's finally time
to sell this house.

14:10.285 --> 14:11.984
Why would I sell my house?

14:11.986 --> 14:13.719
Because it seems
to attract dead bodies.

14:13.721 --> 14:16.489
Then again,
maybe that's just you.

14:16.491 --> 14:17.723
I thought you had

14:17.725 --> 14:19.492
a security system
installed in here?

14:19.494 --> 14:20.726
She had it taken out.

14:20.728 --> 14:22.095
I told you,

14:22.097 --> 14:23.563
I didn't want to feel
like a prisoner in my own home.

14:23.565 --> 14:25.664
Well, you might want
to reconsider.

14:25.666 --> 14:27.833
The I.D. in the wallet
of the deceased

14:27.835 --> 14:29.435
says his name
is Craig Walker.

14:29.437 --> 14:30.536
The car in the driveway

14:30.538 --> 14:32.105
is registered
to the same name.

14:32.107 --> 14:33.239
That's my niece's
husband.

14:33.241 --> 14:34.307
You're sure about that?
They were married?

14:34.309 --> 14:35.874
She showed us
their wedding picture.

14:35.876 --> 14:39.112
Did she happen to say that
they weren't getting along?

14:39.114 --> 14:41.714
No. No, she--

14:41.716 --> 14:42.848
No, it was
the opposite.

14:42.850 --> 14:44.917
She seemed proud
to show us the photos.

14:44.919 --> 14:46.152
Called him handsome,

14:46.154 --> 14:47.720
pointed out how much
the baby looked like him.

14:49.124 --> 14:50.789
Look, I just don't think

14:50.791 --> 14:51.790
we should be rushing
to judgment here.

14:51.792 --> 14:53.726
My niece
may have been kidnapped.

14:53.728 --> 14:55.228
Which is why
we're asking these questions.

14:55.230 --> 14:57.763
You said
she left a bag.

14:57.765 --> 14:59.265
Can we see it?

14:59.267 --> 15:00.799
You know,
it seems really strange

15:00.801 --> 15:01.800
that Regina left her purse,

15:01.802 --> 15:04.003
no matter how big
of a hurry she was in.

15:04.005 --> 15:05.070
Yeah, that does
make it seem

15:05.072 --> 15:06.139
more like
a kidnapping.

15:06.141 --> 15:07.740
Or she could have
staged it.

15:07.742 --> 15:09.708
This is why we don't speculate
in front of civilians

15:09.710 --> 15:11.244
on open cases.

15:11.246 --> 15:13.212
Right. I...

15:13.214 --> 15:15.281
I'll take this
to forensics.

15:15.283 --> 15:18.184
Then I'll help with
the search downstairs.

15:18.186 --> 15:20.052
[sighs] There's nothing
but clothes in here.

15:20.054 --> 15:22.888
Well, nothing but shirts
and blouses, anyway.

15:22.890 --> 15:24.723
So, no pants?

15:24.725 --> 15:26.592
No. No pants...

15:26.594 --> 15:27.860
no socks, nothing.

15:27.862 --> 15:29.562
So, maybe like

15:29.564 --> 15:30.963
she just emptied
one drawer into that bag,

15:30.965 --> 15:32.931
like she was leaving
in a big rush?

15:32.933 --> 15:34.267
We'll be back
to finish searching.

15:34.269 --> 15:35.635
Maybe more evidence
will turn up.

15:35.637 --> 15:37.136
In the meantime,

15:37.138 --> 15:39.138
I need you to try and remember
everything that Regina told you

15:39.140 --> 15:40.473
about why she showed up here.

15:41.742 --> 15:43.509
I pretty much told you
everything.

15:43.511 --> 15:45.511
Well, is it "pretty much"
everything,

15:45.513 --> 15:47.346
or was it actually everything?

15:49.050 --> 15:51.350
I thought Arthur was
handling this investigation.

15:53.254 --> 15:54.587
He will.

15:54.589 --> 15:56.155
He's just never been
the lead detective

15:56.157 --> 15:58.357
on a murder investigation
before, and I'm...

15:58.359 --> 15:59.225
[babbling]

16:00.361 --> 16:02.228
What was that?

16:07.735 --> 16:08.967
[baby cooing]

16:08.969 --> 16:11.737
I think it's coming
from in there.

16:17.645 --> 16:19.612
[baby cooing]

16:31.125 --> 16:33.593
Regina
left her baby.

16:37.298 --> 16:39.498
[♪♪♪]

16:40.702 --> 16:43.135
[radio cracking indistinctly]

16:44.939 --> 16:46.405
[Arthur]: Okay, this doesn't
make any sense.

16:46.407 --> 16:47.540
[Lynn]: I mean,
why would your niece

16:47.542 --> 16:49.174
leave her baby in the tub?

16:49.176 --> 16:50.776
They-They must have
been trying to hide him.

16:50.778 --> 16:52.278
[Arthur]: From whom?
Her husband?

16:52.280 --> 16:54.179
Well, if they were
fighting over him...

16:54.181 --> 16:55.914
Then why leave him behind
after he was dead?

16:55.916 --> 16:58.150
[befuddled sigh]

16:58.152 --> 17:00.119
The most important
question is,

17:00.121 --> 17:01.887
what are we gonna
do with him now?

17:01.889 --> 17:03.723
Well, we can call
Social Services.

17:03.725 --> 17:05.324
What will
they do with him?

17:05.326 --> 17:06.626
First, they'll try

17:06.627 --> 17:07.760
to place him
with a relative,

17:07.762 --> 17:08.894
until we can find
the mother.

17:08.896 --> 17:10.396
I'm a relative.
He should stay with me.

17:10.397 --> 17:11.464
What?

17:11.465 --> 17:12.565
You're gonna
take care of that baby?

17:12.567 --> 17:14.031
You'll help me, right?

17:14.034 --> 17:16.969
Yeah-- Yeah, I'm happy to help.
I just...

17:16.971 --> 17:20.473
I don't know that much
about taking care of babies.

17:20.474 --> 17:21.741
[Martin]: Neither do I,

17:21.742 --> 17:24.877
but I'm sure we can
figure it out for one night.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.579
Besides, Craig's grandparents
are in Corinth, right?

17:27.582 --> 17:29.515
We can take the baby
to them tomorrow.

17:29.517 --> 17:30.816
You said you needed
next-of-kin info--

17:30.818 --> 17:31.850
my phone's in the kitchen.

17:31.852 --> 17:32.718
Great.

17:34.756 --> 17:37.022
See? There you go.

17:40.595 --> 17:42.094
[Hayden fussing]

17:42.096 --> 17:44.129
Oh, um...

17:45.900 --> 17:47.600
Do you have any advice?

17:49.270 --> 17:51.069
[Hayden cries]

17:51.071 --> 17:52.371
Well... for starters,

17:52.373 --> 17:55.441
he needs a diaper change.

17:55.443 --> 17:57.443
Oh! Oh...

17:57.445 --> 17:59.011
Um...

17:59.013 --> 18:01.079
You're a mother.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.615
You know how.

18:02.617 --> 18:05.884
Well, I think
you'll figure it out.

18:12.059 --> 18:13.626
Did you come
with an instruction book?

18:13.628 --> 18:16.061
Because I am very good
with books.

18:16.063 --> 18:16.995
[Hayden fusses]

18:28.576 --> 18:31.176
Oh, John.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.411
What are you doing?

18:32.413 --> 18:35.047
I've had
a wonderful birthday, Aida,

18:35.049 --> 18:37.817
but I still have
one more birthday wish.

18:37.819 --> 18:39.585
You know...

18:39.587 --> 18:41.854
I carry this
with me everywhere.

18:41.856 --> 18:45.791
And I will keep carrying it
until the day you say yes.

18:47.261 --> 18:49.995
Aida, will you
do me the honor--

18:49.997 --> 18:52.465
[phone rings]

18:55.670 --> 18:57.970
It's Aurora. Hello?

18:57.972 --> 18:59.405
<i>Mother? I need help.</i>

18:59.407 --> 19:01.374
I'll be right there.

19:01.376 --> 19:02.541
We have to go.

19:04.412 --> 19:07.212
Okay, so you can take the tab,
but you tuck the front in,

19:07.214 --> 19:09.147
and put it on the side,
right--

19:09.149 --> 19:10.349
no, tighter.

19:10.351 --> 19:12.585
A-Are you sure?
That's not gonna hurt him?

19:12.587 --> 19:13.853
No, you have to make it
tight enough

19:13.855 --> 19:15.020
so that the diaper doesn't
fall off the child.

19:16.323 --> 19:17.956
Here, let me show you.

19:20.795 --> 19:22.060
He's so cute.

19:22.062 --> 19:23.161
Oh, my gosh.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.930
Yes.

19:24.932 --> 19:26.699
Okay, so you wrap it like this,

19:26.701 --> 19:29.368
and you make it nice and tight,

19:29.370 --> 19:31.404
so it's nice and snug, right?

19:31.406 --> 19:32.705
Yes!

19:32.707 --> 19:35.708
[scoffs] Aurora,
you're not even watching.

19:35.710 --> 19:39.044
What? No.
Yeah. I saw.

19:39.046 --> 19:40.979
I just need to figure out

19:40.981 --> 19:43.449
who killed
this poor baby's father,

19:43.451 --> 19:45.317
and find his mother.

19:45.319 --> 19:47.453
Well, being with him right now
is much more important

19:47.455 --> 19:48.987
than anything
that's going on out there.

19:50.691 --> 19:51.857
Yeah, you're right.

19:53.461 --> 19:55.428
[police radios crackling]

19:55.430 --> 19:57.262
But would you watch him?

19:57.264 --> 19:58.363
Just-- Just for a minute?

19:59.600 --> 20:01.734
I don't mind.

20:03.838 --> 20:06.338
[indulgently]:
I don't mind at all, do I?

20:06.340 --> 20:07.673
No, I don't.

20:07.675 --> 20:09.274
[Lynn]: All right. Thanks.

20:09.276 --> 20:11.243
Your niece's husband,
Craig Walker,

20:11.245 --> 20:13.278
was just released from
county jail this morning.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.413
He was there for two days.

20:14.415 --> 20:15.414
[Martin]:
What was the charge?

20:15.416 --> 20:16.615
Check fraud.

20:16.617 --> 20:18.116
Well, at least that's not
a violent crime.

20:18.118 --> 20:19.985
The neighbor to the north was
walking their dog around 6:30,

20:19.987 --> 20:22.721
he said he saw a red car
pull out of the driveway.

20:22.723 --> 20:23.856
Yeah, Regina
drives a red sedan.

20:23.858 --> 20:25.157
Well, he saw
two people in the car.

20:25.159 --> 20:27.860
The driver was a woman,
long hair, light in color.

20:27.862 --> 20:29.027
What about
the passenger?

20:29.029 --> 20:30.195
All he saw was shadows.

20:30.197 --> 20:31.864
He couldn't tell
if it was a man or a woman.

20:31.866 --> 20:33.265
That sounds like
a kidnapping to me.

20:33.267 --> 20:35.935
Whoever killed Craig
forced Regina to go with him.

20:35.937 --> 20:37.670
Or it could have been
her accomplice in the murder.

20:37.672 --> 20:39.304
We're just going
to have to wait and see.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.940
I was just about to say that.

20:40.942 --> 20:42.107
That's all for now.

20:44.912 --> 20:48.013
[Aida]: Okay, the baby
is sound asleep,

20:48.015 --> 20:50.215
and I made an extra bottle
and put it in the fridge.

20:50.217 --> 20:52.317
How will I know
when to give it to him?

20:52.319 --> 20:55.120
Oh, he'll let you know
when he's hungry.

20:55.122 --> 20:57.756
He has complete faith in you.

20:57.758 --> 20:59.692
So do I.

20:59.694 --> 21:02.027
Thank you
for staying late.

21:02.029 --> 21:03.796
Mm. Call me
if you need anything, okay?

21:03.798 --> 21:06.431
Let us know if
we can help in any way.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.734
I'm sure your niece
will be found safe.

21:08.736 --> 21:10.435
Thanks, John.

21:11.572 --> 21:13.205
Good night.

21:14.441 --> 21:17.643
Whoever killed Craig may
be coming back for that baby.

21:17.645 --> 21:19.512
I'm staying in
the guest room tonight.

21:19.514 --> 21:21.346
Okay.

21:26.120 --> 21:28.286
[♪♪♪]

21:37.464 --> 21:38.497
[Aurora cries out]

21:40.401 --> 21:41.734
Aurora? What's the matter?

21:41.736 --> 21:43.602
Found another body!

21:43.604 --> 21:44.770
What?

21:45.907 --> 21:47.339
Hey.

21:47.341 --> 21:48.206
Ah!

21:51.546 --> 21:52.711
[grunts]

21:52.713 --> 21:54.146
What is going on?

21:54.148 --> 21:54.980
That's what
you're gonna tell me.

21:58.351 --> 21:59.484
-Who are you?
-I'm Rory!

21:59.486 --> 22:02.187
I'm Rory Brown.
I'm Craig's friend.

22:02.189 --> 22:04.389
[grunts]

22:04.391 --> 22:06.324
You came here
with Craig?

22:06.326 --> 22:07.525
Yeah, that's right.

22:07.527 --> 22:08.593
We got let out of
the county jail this morning.

22:08.595 --> 22:09.960
We drove down
to see Regina.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.563
Just ask her!

22:11.565 --> 22:12.897
Regina's not here.

22:12.899 --> 22:14.732
W-- Where is she?

22:14.734 --> 22:16.000
That's a good
question.

22:16.002 --> 22:16.867
Who're you hiding from
in the closet?

22:18.938 --> 22:20.004
You don't have to look
at me like that.

22:20.006 --> 22:20.838
Just ask Craig.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.608
Craig's not here either.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.176
Craig's dead.

22:25.178 --> 22:26.277
Someone shot him.

22:27.614 --> 22:29.247
No.

22:29.249 --> 22:31.316
No, that can't be true.

22:31.318 --> 22:33.851
[shouts]: Craig!
Craig! Where are you?

22:36.289 --> 22:38.556
Hey, Craig. Craig!
We gotta get outta here!

22:38.558 --> 22:40.858
He's gone.
He was shot on the porch.

22:44.797 --> 22:47.232
There's blood...

22:47.234 --> 22:49.066
[quiet gasp]

22:51.538 --> 22:53.371
[voice cracks]:
He's really dead?

22:55.642 --> 22:57.842
I'm getting my phone
and calling Lynn.

22:57.844 --> 23:00.311
Please--
please, don't do that.

23:00.313 --> 23:01.713
[hushed]: Martin,

23:01.715 --> 23:03.848
we have to call the police
and let them deal with that...

23:03.850 --> 23:04.815
guy.

23:04.817 --> 23:05.650
If we do,

23:05.652 --> 23:07.017
they'll take him into custody,

23:07.019 --> 23:09.186
and I won't be able to get
anything out of him.

23:09.188 --> 23:10.888
What do you expect
to get out of him?

23:10.890 --> 23:12.089
He knows
who took Regina.

23:12.091 --> 23:14.259
Why else was he hiding
in that closet?

23:14.261 --> 23:15.493
I just need to convince him
to tell me.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.228
He may seem harmless,

23:17.230 --> 23:19.764
but we don't really know
how dangerous he is.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.666
I can handle him.

23:22.935 --> 23:25.202
I let Regina down before.

23:25.204 --> 23:27.272
After her mother died,
I wasn't there for her.

23:27.274 --> 23:28.773
I need to be here for her.
I need to find her.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.577
Just give me
a few hours with him

23:32.579 --> 23:34.445
to see
what he might tell me.

23:34.447 --> 23:37.482
You can go upstairs,
get some sleep,

23:37.484 --> 23:39.584
and, in the morning,
if you still want to call Lynn,

23:39.586 --> 23:41.218
I won't try to talk you
out of it.

23:41.220 --> 23:42.086
I won't.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.924
Okay.

23:56.836 --> 23:59.304
[♪♪♪]

24:03.910 --> 24:05.777
I'm pretty sure the Chief
never shadowed you

24:05.779 --> 24:07.244
when it was your case.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.280
Well, maybe I'm
a different kind of Chief.

24:09.282 --> 24:10.881
Maybe I'm the kind
that rolls up my sleeves

24:10.883 --> 24:12.183
and pitches in.

24:12.185 --> 24:14.919
Yeah... or...

24:14.921 --> 24:18.423
maybe you just don't think
I can get the job done right.

24:18.425 --> 24:20.725
Arthur... no.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.761
I know you're a good detective.

24:23.763 --> 24:26.364
I just...

24:26.366 --> 24:28.299
I don't know how
to stop being one yet.

24:28.301 --> 24:31.836
Well, if that's all this is,
then...

24:31.838 --> 24:33.404
I'm happy to work together
on this case.

24:34.641 --> 24:38.042
You're a good detective.

24:38.044 --> 24:39.844
And even better husband.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.846
Yes, I am.

24:41.848 --> 24:42.947
Now come on.

24:42.949 --> 24:45.149
Let's do this.

24:50.289 --> 24:51.889
[knocking]

24:55.027 --> 24:56.728
Can I help you?

24:56.730 --> 24:58.229
[Arthur]: Are you
Thelma Walker?

24:58.231 --> 24:59.464
Grandmother
of Craig Walker?

24:59.466 --> 25:00.598
Yes.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.699
I'm Detective Arthur Smith

25:01.701 --> 25:03.033
of the Lawrenceton
Police Department.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.302
This is Captain Smith.

25:05.304 --> 25:07.304
I'm afraid
we have some bad news.

25:10.343 --> 25:13.110
We told Craig
over and over again,

25:13.112 --> 25:14.579
"If you don't fly right,

25:14.581 --> 25:16.113
it's gonna come back
to bite you."

25:16.115 --> 25:18.916
Never thought
it would bite this hard.

25:18.918 --> 25:21.218
[Thelma]: No.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.220
Craig didn't always
follow the rules...

25:23.222 --> 25:25.155
His record
shows six arrests.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.290
For little things...

25:26.292 --> 25:27.859
like, shoplifting.

25:27.861 --> 25:29.293
We did the best we could,

25:29.295 --> 25:32.730
raising him after
his mom and dad passed away.

25:32.732 --> 25:35.433
And he had a good heart.

25:35.435 --> 25:38.469
I can't imagine
who'd want to hurt him.

25:38.471 --> 25:41.773
Well, I'm sure the baby
will be a big comfort to you.

25:43.443 --> 25:44.809
Baby?

25:46.212 --> 25:48.579
[♪♪♪]

26:08.067 --> 26:09.233
Morning!

26:09.235 --> 26:10.334
Morning.

26:10.336 --> 26:11.569
Get any sleep?

26:11.571 --> 26:13.504
Uh, some.
How about you?

26:13.506 --> 26:17.207
Nope. I was
watching Rory all night.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.409
I started a bottle.

26:18.411 --> 26:19.510
Oh, thank you.

26:19.512 --> 26:21.512
So what did you find out
from him?

26:21.514 --> 26:23.314
He was very forthcoming

26:23.316 --> 26:25.616
about his bad
check-writing spree with Craig.

26:25.618 --> 26:27.985
But he swears he has no idea
who killed him,

26:27.987 --> 26:29.921
or took Regina.

26:29.923 --> 26:32.289
Maybe he really doesn't know.

26:32.291 --> 26:34.124
No, he knows.
I'm sure of that.

26:35.462 --> 26:37.795
Well, then maybe Lynn and Arthur
can find out the truth from him.

26:39.432 --> 26:42.066
Um, i-if we call the police,

26:42.068 --> 26:43.568
he'll go back to jail

26:43.570 --> 26:46.504
for violating the terms
of his release,

26:46.506 --> 26:49.139
which includes ending
his association with Craig...

26:49.141 --> 26:52.242
Oh, please don't say what
I think you're going to say.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.044
If I can gain his trust

26:54.046 --> 26:56.380
by not calling
the police,

26:56.382 --> 26:58.950
and having him tag along with us
to Corinth,

26:58.952 --> 27:00.818
then maybe
he'll feel comfortable enough

27:00.820 --> 27:02.487
to tell us who showed up here
yesterday

27:02.489 --> 27:04.021
and scared him so badly,

27:04.023 --> 27:05.389
he ended up
in your closet.

27:05.391 --> 27:06.724
Maybe he was hiding
in the closet

27:06.726 --> 27:08.359
because he's the one
that shot Craig.

27:08.361 --> 27:09.827
I thought about that.

27:09.829 --> 27:14.064
But do you remember his reaction
when we told him Craig was dead?

27:14.066 --> 27:15.265
Did that seem
manufactured to you?

27:15.267 --> 27:17.067
No.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.435
But either way,

27:18.437 --> 27:20.605
you said that you wouldn't
stop me from calling Lynn.

27:20.607 --> 27:22.974
I'm not.

27:22.976 --> 27:24.542
I'm just asking...

27:24.544 --> 27:26.744
what if it were
Sally that went missing?

27:26.746 --> 27:29.313
Or your mom?

27:34.921 --> 27:36.621
Hey. What
are you doing?

27:36.623 --> 27:38.222
Oh, uh, I was-- I was

27:38.224 --> 27:40.224
seeing how many diapers
the little guy had left.

27:42.094 --> 27:43.561
Is that
coffee I smell?

27:43.563 --> 27:45.429
Hi, little guy!

27:47.500 --> 27:49.901
[♪♪♪]

28:05.217 --> 28:06.717
Care to explain this?

28:08.454 --> 28:10.788
Uh, it's a load of cash.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.690
Yeah. It's $10,000.

28:12.692 --> 28:13.958
Found it in the diaper bag.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.793
And I found him
looking for it.

28:17.163 --> 28:19.329
Where'd this money
come from, Rory?

28:20.733 --> 28:23.267
Look, I've tried
the "good cop" routine with you.

28:23.269 --> 28:24.735
You do not want to see
my bad side.

28:24.737 --> 28:25.903
Martin, no.

28:25.905 --> 28:28.105
Okay, okay,
it came from the bad checks.

28:28.107 --> 28:31.341
Craig was gonna pay the midwife
who delivered Hayden.

28:31.343 --> 28:33.711
Midwife?

28:33.713 --> 28:35.245
Regina didn't deliver him
at a hospital?

28:35.247 --> 28:36.581
No, ma'am.

28:36.583 --> 28:38.015
She wanted to do it
all natural.

28:38.017 --> 28:40.051
But I guess
a midwife isn't cheap,

28:40.053 --> 28:42.219
and he still owed her
a lot of money.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.154
You expect us to believe

28:44.156 --> 28:46.156
that you wrote
a string of bad checks

28:46.158 --> 28:47.191
to pay for a midwife?

28:47.193 --> 28:48.993
Well, I never met her
or anything.

28:48.995 --> 28:51.228
[Aurora]: I don't think I put
Hayden's diaper on tight enough.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.830
It's leaking,

28:52.832 --> 28:55.232
and I didn't see
any other sleepers

28:55.234 --> 28:56.300
to change him into,

28:56.302 --> 28:57.534
so, um...

28:57.536 --> 28:58.970
um, here.

28:58.972 --> 29:00.004
What?

29:00.006 --> 29:01.271
Watch him,
please?

29:01.273 --> 29:03.307
I'm gonna go to the store
and buy him a new sleeper.

29:04.677 --> 29:07.044
You're just going to leave me
here with him?

29:07.046 --> 29:09.113
Yes, "Uncle Martin."

29:09.115 --> 29:10.514
Bottle's right there.

29:10.516 --> 29:11.782
But... he's leaking!

29:11.784 --> 29:13.784
What if he cries?

29:13.786 --> 29:15.452
Mm. He hardly ever cries.

29:15.454 --> 29:16.754
Nobody's asking you.

29:22.128 --> 29:24.428
[♪♪♪]

29:45.118 --> 29:48.886
Here's the key Mr. Walker
gave us to enter the house.

29:50.356 --> 29:52.723
[woman]: Excuse me.

29:52.725 --> 29:54.224
Hi. Um...

29:54.226 --> 29:56.861
[stammers]

29:56.863 --> 29:58.529
I can't help but notice
the police car.

29:58.531 --> 30:00.064
Is everything okay
with Craig and Regina?

30:04.637 --> 30:08.706
Oh, thanks for going with me
to get the baby stuff.

30:08.708 --> 30:10.675
I'm not sure
how much help I was.

30:10.677 --> 30:12.877
It's hardly my area
of expertise.

30:12.879 --> 30:15.412
Are you sure we got
the right size?

30:15.414 --> 30:17.447
Well, it says "newborn."
He's brand-new, isn't he?

30:17.449 --> 30:19.383
Yeah, but he's heavy.

30:19.385 --> 30:20.751
I mean, he must be heavy

30:20.753 --> 30:24.088
because my arms are already
sore from carrying him.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.792
You know, last night,
Martin asked me

30:27.794 --> 30:30.260
if I wanted to have
children someday,

30:30.262 --> 30:33.230
and I said "yes."

30:33.232 --> 30:34.799
And now
I'm just overwhelmed

30:34.801 --> 30:37.367
buying a baby
a sleeper!

30:37.369 --> 30:39.636
So tell me more
about this Rory guy.

30:39.638 --> 30:40.905
You're really not
gonna turn him over

30:40.907 --> 30:42.239
to Lynn and Arthur?

30:42.241 --> 30:43.340
I know, we should,

30:43.342 --> 30:45.442
but Martin's
probably right.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.311
Our best hope of
getting this kid

30:47.313 --> 30:48.478
to tell us
anything he knows

30:48.480 --> 30:49.714
is to earn his trust.

30:49.716 --> 30:52.717
And I don't think he's gonna
trust anyone with a badge.

30:52.719 --> 30:53.918
Plus, Martin's C.I.A.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.319
He knows how
to get information.

30:55.321 --> 30:56.486
That makes sense.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.122
It's just...

30:58.124 --> 31:00.024
my editor wants me
to write about this case

31:00.026 --> 31:02.259
and I think I'm gonna
have a hard time

31:02.261 --> 31:04.628
pretending to know
nothing about Rory

31:04.630 --> 31:06.797
when I meet with Arthur
in five minutes.

31:06.799 --> 31:07.898
Yeah, you really do

31:07.900 --> 31:09.299
have the world's
worst poker face.

31:09.301 --> 31:10.534
[heavy sigh] I know.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.369
A reporter needs
a poker face!

31:12.371 --> 31:13.971
Anyway,
I have to go.

31:13.973 --> 31:15.039
I have to find out

31:15.041 --> 31:17.241
if there are any new
developments in my case.

31:17.243 --> 31:18.508
Well, I'll go with you.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.344
I can stop you
if you start to blab.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.747
Oh, good idea.

31:22.749 --> 31:25.182
[♪♪♪]

31:28.121 --> 31:29.153
Oh!

31:29.155 --> 31:30.420
Hey, Arthur.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.256
We're just coming to see you
for that interview.

31:32.258 --> 31:33.457
Oh, hey.

31:33.459 --> 31:34.859
I am gonna need
a few minutes.

31:34.861 --> 31:36.060
We just got back
from Corinth.

31:36.062 --> 31:38.129
Something odd came up.

31:38.131 --> 31:40.297
[Lynn]: You're gonna to need
more than a few minutes,

31:40.299 --> 31:41.565
so you should
probably reschedule.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.167
Wait! What came up?
What's going on in Corinth?

31:43.169 --> 31:44.534
Craig's grandparents
had no idea

31:44.536 --> 31:46.370
Regina was expecting a baby.

31:46.372 --> 31:49.073
[♪♪♪]

31:49.075 --> 31:50.174
What?

31:53.150 --> 31:55.950
[Martin]: So I went upstairs
to put the baby down for a nap,

31:55.952 --> 31:57.752
I come back down,
Rory's gone.

31:57.754 --> 32:00.522
I'm pretty sure
he's headed back to Corinth.

32:00.524 --> 32:01.889
Well, we're just gonna have
to find him there, then.

32:03.260 --> 32:05.393
I'm still trying to make sense
of what Arthur told me.

32:06.729 --> 32:09.864
Could Rory have made up
that she delivered to a midwife?

32:09.866 --> 32:13.435
Did Craig and Regina
adopt a baby?

32:13.437 --> 32:17.138
You said Rory was adamant
she had that baby.

32:17.140 --> 32:18.739
Well, it's pretty clear now
that the guy can't be trusted.

32:20.677 --> 32:22.710
Maybe Craig's grandparents
will give us some clues.

32:24.381 --> 32:27.148
[♪♪♪]

32:30.720 --> 32:32.554
Ballistics just came back.

32:32.556 --> 32:33.921
Craig Walker had
a .270-caliber bullet

32:33.923 --> 32:34.922
in his chest.

32:34.924 --> 32:36.991
That is a big bullet.

32:36.993 --> 32:38.359
That is a bullet
from a hunting rifle.

32:40.197 --> 32:42.630
Can you picture
Bartell's 22-year-old niece

32:42.632 --> 32:44.999
carting around a newborn
and a rifle?

32:45.001 --> 32:45.933
Doesn't fit.

32:45.935 --> 32:46.834
Yeah.

32:48.071 --> 32:51.072
Corinth P.D. gave us
Walker's arrest records.

32:51.074 --> 32:52.373
In his last arrest,
three days ago,

32:52.375 --> 32:53.408
check fraud?

32:53.410 --> 32:54.609
Apparently he had
a partner in crime.

32:54.611 --> 32:56.811
Rory Brown.

32:56.813 --> 32:58.746
He was released the same day
as Walker.

32:58.748 --> 33:00.648
Rory Brown, huh?

33:00.650 --> 33:01.782
I wonder where he is.

33:02.919 --> 33:04.185
Good question.

33:04.187 --> 33:05.320
I told Craig

33:05.322 --> 33:08.089
that Rory Brown
is a bad influence,

33:08.091 --> 33:10.558
but did he
listen to me? No.

33:10.560 --> 33:11.792
And now he's dead.

33:11.794 --> 33:13.861
I don't know why Craig
didn't tell us

33:13.863 --> 33:16.131
Regina was expecting.

33:16.133 --> 33:18.199
Unless he's not the father.

33:18.201 --> 33:19.434
[Ed]: Ah, Rory spent

33:19.436 --> 33:21.936
a little too much time
hanging around Regina.

33:23.173 --> 33:24.472
Regina told us

33:24.474 --> 33:27.342
she thought the baby
looked very much like Craig.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.245
Do you think he does, Ed?

33:32.516 --> 33:33.748
[chuckles warmly]

33:33.750 --> 33:34.749
We thought
you might like

33:34.751 --> 33:36.518
to spend some time
with the baby.

33:36.520 --> 33:38.486
Maybe have him
stay here with you?

33:38.488 --> 33:40.921
Well, I don't...
I mean...

33:40.923 --> 33:43.057
We want him
to have a good home.

33:43.059 --> 33:46.494
My husband isn't well,
and...

33:46.496 --> 33:47.629
And it's just
not the right time.

33:51.234 --> 33:52.700
All right.

33:52.702 --> 33:55.002
If you're Regina's uncle,

33:55.004 --> 33:57.938
maybe you should be the one
to keep the baby?

33:57.940 --> 34:00.675
Me? Uh, well...

34:00.677 --> 34:02.109
I think
he'll need some time

34:02.111 --> 34:03.911
to think about
that, too.

34:05.114 --> 34:06.514
Do you have any idea

34:06.516 --> 34:08.949
where we might
find Rory?

34:08.951 --> 34:10.985
You could try his mother's.

34:10.987 --> 34:12.152
Or, like I said before,

34:12.155 --> 34:14.188
he spent lot of time
at Craig and Regina's.

34:14.190 --> 34:15.989
They rent the place from us.

34:15.992 --> 34:17.792
Oh!

34:17.793 --> 34:19.427
Do you think we could
stop by there?

34:19.429 --> 34:21.563
We need to find

34:21.565 --> 34:23.431
anything that will
lead us to Regina.

34:24.601 --> 34:26.467
And to help us bring
whoever killed your grandson

34:26.469 --> 34:27.368
to justice.

34:28.938 --> 34:30.804
I'll get the key for you.

34:36.079 --> 34:37.911
Hey, if you give me

34:37.914 --> 34:39.280
the key Craig's
grandfather gave you,

34:39.282 --> 34:41.349
I can check
the house out for Rory.

34:44.621 --> 34:45.753
Excuse me?

34:45.755 --> 34:48.322
Hello? Uh...

34:48.324 --> 34:49.556
I'm Margaret Granberry,

34:49.559 --> 34:50.891
and I just have to ask

34:50.893 --> 34:52.927
if you've heard anything
about Regina?

34:52.929 --> 34:55.196
We've been worrying
over it all day.

34:55.197 --> 34:56.864
You know Regina?

34:56.866 --> 34:58.099
I do.

34:58.101 --> 34:59.667
We talked to the police
this morning,

34:59.669 --> 35:01.469
and they told us
what happened to Craig,

35:01.471 --> 35:03.238
and that they didn't know
what happened to Regina.

35:03.240 --> 35:05.273
Oh, it's just awful!

35:05.275 --> 35:06.474
Yeah.

35:06.476 --> 35:08.243
Unfortunately,
Regina's still missing.

35:08.245 --> 35:10.111
Oh.

35:11.281 --> 35:12.847
That's my friend, Cathy.

35:12.849 --> 35:15.983
She's so upset
about Regina, too.

35:15.985 --> 35:18.085
I thought
I saw a little baby.

35:18.087 --> 35:20.221
Can I take a look?

35:20.223 --> 35:22.189
Ohh!

35:22.191 --> 35:23.090
What a cutie!

35:23.092 --> 35:24.759
Can I hold him?

35:24.761 --> 35:26.060
Uh, let me
introduce you

35:26.062 --> 35:27.094
before you go
grabbing her baby.

35:27.096 --> 35:28.463
[awkward chuckling]

35:28.465 --> 35:30.598
This is Cathy Davis.
And you are?

35:30.600 --> 35:31.866
Aurora Teagarden.

35:31.868 --> 35:32.767
Oh.

35:34.437 --> 35:37.505
Uh, and that's
Regina's Uncle Martin.

35:37.507 --> 35:38.473
Oh...

35:38.475 --> 35:40.408
he looks worried sick.

35:41.645 --> 35:43.378
Hi. Rory's not here.

35:43.380 --> 35:45.313
I'm gonna check
his mom's house.

35:45.315 --> 35:47.415
Door's open.

35:49.452 --> 35:51.319
Oh, I think he's hungry.

35:51.321 --> 35:53.187
I'd better go inside
and give him a bottle.

35:53.189 --> 35:55.055
If you'd like help,
I'd just love to.

35:55.057 --> 35:57.358
Oh! Uh...

35:57.360 --> 35:58.559
[sighs]

35:58.561 --> 36:01.195
Yeah, help would be nice.

36:03.366 --> 36:06.634
Here, let me take that
for you.

36:08.438 --> 36:11.872
I bet you don't give
anyone any trouble at all,

36:11.874 --> 36:13.675
do you, angel?

36:13.677 --> 36:15.376
She has baby fever.

36:15.378 --> 36:19.747
We're trying to have a baby, but
it just hasn't happened.

36:19.749 --> 36:24.084
I was made to be a mother
and my husband a father.

36:26.155 --> 36:27.622
Your baby looks
like your husband.

36:27.624 --> 36:30.325
Oh, that wasn't my husband.

36:30.327 --> 36:32.827
And that's not my baby.
That's Regina's baby, Hayden.

36:32.829 --> 36:35.029
I didn't know
Regina was pregnant.

36:35.031 --> 36:36.964
Did you know that,
Margaret?

36:36.966 --> 36:38.999
[Margaret]: Well, the police
stopped by this morning

36:39.001 --> 36:40.267
and said she'd had a baby.

36:40.269 --> 36:43.037
I mean, I told them I didn't
see how it was possible.

36:43.039 --> 36:46.273
I suppose I thought she'd gained
a little weight, but...

36:46.275 --> 36:48.343
When was the last time
you talked to her?

36:48.345 --> 36:51.446
Uh, maybe a month,
two months?

36:51.448 --> 36:53.180
So you weren't close?

36:53.182 --> 36:54.382
Well, we talked
quite a bit

36:54.384 --> 36:55.750
when they first moved
in here last fall, but...

36:55.752 --> 36:57.485
Well, I met her
a few times.

36:57.487 --> 36:59.687
I can't remember
the last time I saw her,

36:59.689 --> 37:02.757
but I think I would've
noticed a baby bump.

37:02.759 --> 37:06.193
I mean, I notice
all baby bumps.

37:06.195 --> 37:07.495
Mm.

37:07.497 --> 37:10.832
Aren't babies just
the most magical creatures?

37:10.834 --> 37:12.900
See what I mean?

37:12.902 --> 37:14.134
Baby fever.

37:18.241 --> 37:21.175
[station chatter]

37:22.612 --> 37:24.912
Hi. I'm Sally Allison.
<i>Lawrenceton Times.</i>

37:24.914 --> 37:25.880
Oh, I know who you are,
Miss Allison.

37:27.216 --> 37:29.950
I have an appointment
to interview Detective Smith,

37:29.952 --> 37:31.085
and, oh...

37:31.087 --> 37:33.488
I think I see him now,
so I'll just go on back.

37:33.490 --> 37:35.456
I've been asked to escort
you to your meeting.

37:37.193 --> 37:38.826
Oh, okay.

37:41.464 --> 37:44.198
Hey. You heard anything
from Corinth on Rory Brown yet?

37:44.200 --> 37:45.733
Nope. Nothing.

37:45.735 --> 37:48.235
Well, I got a call into
Craig Walker's public defender.

37:48.237 --> 37:49.871
-A guy named Alan Perkins.
-Alan Perkins?

37:49.873 --> 37:51.238
I know that name!

37:51.240 --> 37:52.707
I interviewed him
for a story once.

37:52.709 --> 37:53.974
Hi, Lynn!

37:53.976 --> 37:55.643
Sorry, Detective.
She got away from me.

37:55.645 --> 37:57.412
That's okay.
She does that.

37:57.414 --> 37:59.514
Hey, Sally.
A story on what?

37:59.516 --> 38:00.715
Well, it, was...

38:02.652 --> 38:04.752
...About
an illegal adoption ring.

38:04.754 --> 38:06.921
Wait. As in baby adoption?

38:06.923 --> 38:08.589
Yes.

38:08.591 --> 38:10.658
You'd better head
back up to Corinth.

38:10.660 --> 38:13.060
Yeah, I'll follow up
on Rory Brown while I'm there.

38:13.062 --> 38:15.563
-Rory Brown?
-Yes.

38:15.565 --> 38:16.597
Why?

38:16.599 --> 38:19.133
Nothing, I just...

38:19.135 --> 38:21.201
think the name is interesting.

38:22.572 --> 38:24.439
Can I tag along with you
for my story?

38:24.441 --> 38:26.407
Yeah, I don't think
that's a good idea.

38:26.409 --> 38:28.976
Well, it's her lead...

38:28.978 --> 38:30.845
And it's my case.

38:32.482 --> 38:35.215
Okay. Fine.
You, don't get in the way.

38:36.453 --> 38:37.418
I mean it!

38:37.420 --> 38:39.554
Okay. Let's go.

38:40.723 --> 38:42.657
[Hayden crying]

38:45.462 --> 38:47.194
Rory's nowhere
to be found.

38:47.196 --> 38:49.330
I think it's time
to give up on Rory.

38:49.332 --> 38:50.397
Oh, no.

38:50.399 --> 38:51.799
I'm going to find
that slippery kid.

38:51.801 --> 38:53.568
And no more trying
to reason with him

38:53.570 --> 38:54.735
so he'll talk to me.

38:54.737 --> 38:55.703
[Hayden crying]

38:55.705 --> 38:57.037
He's wet.

38:57.039 --> 38:59.540
Do you mind getting a sleeper
out of the diaper bag,

38:59.542 --> 39:01.375
and a diaper?

39:04.481 --> 39:06.313
Whoa. You got a lot of stuff.

39:06.315 --> 39:08.916
I know.
I had to buy him everything.

39:08.918 --> 39:11.085
So tiny.

39:12.755 --> 39:14.522
Wait, Martin...

39:14.524 --> 39:17.291
I had to buy him
all new clothes because...

39:17.293 --> 39:19.527
Regina didn't pack him any.

39:19.529 --> 39:22.229
And I looked through
the whole house.

39:22.231 --> 39:25.265
There-- There isn't a crib,
there isn't a bassinet,

39:25.267 --> 39:26.534
there isn't anything in here

39:26.536 --> 39:29.236
that says Craig and Regina
were expecting a baby.

39:30.473 --> 39:32.172
What are you saying?

39:35.845 --> 39:39.580
I'm saying I think
Regina kidnapped this baby.

39:51.124 --> 39:52.958
Hey, thanks for coming.

39:52.960 --> 39:55.361
I called you guys,
because--

39:55.363 --> 39:56.595
Because Roe has this theory

39:56.597 --> 39:58.831
that Regina kidnapped
somebody else's baby,

39:58.833 --> 40:00.065
which is absurd.

40:00.067 --> 40:01.767
[Arthur]: Well... maybe not.

40:01.769 --> 40:03.902
So the attorney who
represented Craig Walker

40:03.904 --> 40:04.837
with his check fraud

40:04.839 --> 40:06.204
is the same attorney
who represented

40:06.206 --> 40:08.206
the leader of
an illegal adoption ring.

40:08.208 --> 40:10.275
I wrote a story on it.
I had to interview him!

40:10.277 --> 40:13.178
I knew it!
See? That would explain so much.

40:13.180 --> 40:15.013
No. Regina did not
take someone else's child.

40:15.015 --> 40:16.715
Martin, I know
it's hard to believe

40:16.717 --> 40:18.250
that Regina could
do such a thing,

40:18.252 --> 40:20.318
and I really hope
that it's not true,

40:20.320 --> 40:22.621
but she didn't have
any baby clothes,

40:22.623 --> 40:25.591
and there are no baby
things in that house.

40:25.593 --> 40:27.459
But if Regina snatched him
from someone,

40:27.461 --> 40:29.695
and came to hide out
at Uncle Martin's,

40:29.697 --> 40:31.062
and the real parents
followed her there...

40:31.064 --> 40:32.431
Which is not what happened.

40:32.433 --> 40:34.433
[Arthur]: Well, we can find out
with a DNA test, okay?

40:34.435 --> 40:36.535
I'll get a tech out here to get
a sample from you and the baby.

40:36.537 --> 40:38.069
The tests are fast,

40:38.071 --> 40:39.371
we'll know pretty quickly
if you guys are related.

40:39.373 --> 40:40.873
Yeah, and if you're not,

40:40.875 --> 40:42.374
that would give us a motive
for Craig's murder.

40:42.376 --> 40:43.809
Or a motive
for taking Regina.

40:43.811 --> 40:45.243
I mean, if she convinced them

40:45.245 --> 40:46.845
that the baby wasn't with her,
that he was somewhere else,

40:46.847 --> 40:48.847
they'd want to take her
for leverage to get him back.

40:48.849 --> 40:52.818
Uh-huh. And what about
the money in the diaper bag?

40:52.820 --> 40:54.085
How would it
explain that?

40:54.087 --> 40:55.086
Wait.

40:55.088 --> 40:57.122
What money?

40:57.124 --> 40:59.425
We found $10,000
in Hayden's diaper bag.

40:59.427 --> 41:01.693
But Rory said that Craig
was gonna use the money

41:01.695 --> 41:04.162
to pay the midwife
to deliver the... baby.

41:04.164 --> 41:05.230
Rory?

41:05.232 --> 41:06.832
As in Rory Brown?
You've talked to him?

41:06.834 --> 41:09.668
We found him hiding
in my linen closet last night.

41:09.670 --> 41:10.836
What? And--

41:10.838 --> 41:12.370
You're just
telling me this now?

41:12.372 --> 41:13.772
That was my doing.

41:13.774 --> 41:15.340
I thought I could
get him to talk to me.

41:15.342 --> 41:16.809
It was a bad decision.

41:16.811 --> 41:18.209
He gave me the slip.

41:18.211 --> 41:20.846
You found a guy hiding
in your house after a murder,

41:20.848 --> 41:23.081
making him the prime suspect
in that murder,

41:23.083 --> 41:25.584
and you chose not to tell me?
I mean, that's...

41:25.586 --> 41:27.052
obstruction of justice!
I--

41:27.054 --> 41:28.420
Ohh!

41:28.422 --> 41:29.721
If you weren't Aurora's...

41:29.723 --> 41:31.757
I-I don't even know.

41:31.759 --> 41:33.459
I've never seen Arthur mad.
Have you seen Arthur mad?

41:34.895 --> 41:36.662
Rory was no longer a suspect
in my mind.

41:36.664 --> 41:38.363
I conducted a thorough search
of Roe's house

41:38.365 --> 41:39.965
and the grounds,
for a gun,

41:39.967 --> 41:41.500
ruling him out.

41:41.502 --> 41:42.701
Wait. I didn't know that.
You didn't tell me.

41:44.137 --> 41:46.371
Okay. Okay.

50:11.150 --> 50:12.083
I could tell you.

50:13.186 --> 50:14.719
Oh! Jason. Dell.

50:14.721 --> 50:15.687
Perry's cousin,
remember?

50:15.689 --> 50:16.854
Yeah.

50:16.856 --> 50:17.855
What are you
doing here?

50:17.857 --> 50:19.290
Ah, I'm here
to see Mr. Perkins.

50:19.292 --> 50:20.625
How do you know him?

50:20.627 --> 50:22.227
He used to be my lawyer
back in the day.

50:22.229 --> 50:24.562
Got me and a friend of mine
out of some trouble.

50:24.564 --> 50:25.896
Now I do a mentor program
with him,

50:25.898 --> 50:27.865
it's like a "Big Brother"
sort of thing.

50:27.867 --> 50:28.933
Good for the kids.

50:28.935 --> 50:30.401
Oh, that's
really sweet.

50:30.403 --> 50:31.836
W-- Wait a minute.

50:31.838 --> 50:35.340
Are all of you Dell boys
in... with criminals?

50:35.342 --> 50:36.608
-Sally.
-Well, I--

50:36.610 --> 50:37.808
It's okay.

50:37.810 --> 50:39.444
Perry and I certainly had
our run-ins with the law,

50:39.446 --> 50:40.545
but we're both on
the straight and narrow now.

50:40.547 --> 50:41.812
You can ask Perkins.

50:41.814 --> 50:44.014
He's the one who talked us
into the good deed thing.

50:44.016 --> 50:46.417
Oh, he did?

50:46.419 --> 50:48.219
Yeah, so that should probably
answer your question about him.

50:48.221 --> 50:49.854
My question?

50:49.856 --> 50:51.756
Well, weren't you wondering
whether if he was an honest guy?

50:51.758 --> 50:53.157
Oh, right.

50:54.494 --> 50:56.694
Perry'll tell you the same thing
when he's back in town.

50:56.696 --> 50:57.828
Him and my buddy, Rory.

50:57.830 --> 50:59.364
Wait. Rory?

50:59.366 --> 51:01.165
You don't mean
Rory Brown, do you?

51:01.167 --> 51:02.933
I do.

51:02.935 --> 51:05.069
Him and I were in juvenile
detention at the same time.

51:05.071 --> 51:06.871
He's also a client of Perkins.

51:06.873 --> 51:08.873
Jason knows Rory Brown!

51:12.779 --> 51:15.012
[Lillian]:
I just changed his diaper.

51:15.014 --> 51:17.047
[Aurora]: Well, thank you
for doing that for me.

51:17.049 --> 51:19.049
Oh, I didn't do it for you,
I did it for him.

51:19.051 --> 51:20.785
Aurora?

51:20.787 --> 51:22.820
Why didn't you call and tell me

51:22.822 --> 51:24.589
that you were getting to work
late today?

51:24.591 --> 51:26.357
[Aurora]: How did you
know I was--?

51:26.359 --> 51:28.225
I feel terrible
that I left him here,

51:28.227 --> 51:30.060
thinking you were going
to be here any minute.

51:30.062 --> 51:32.497
I'm sorry,
but-but he was fine.

51:32.499 --> 51:34.098
Lillian took
very good care of him.

51:34.100 --> 51:36.000
I took excellent
care of him.

51:36.002 --> 51:39.970
You can't just pass
a baby around like a hot potato.

51:39.972 --> 51:44.509
You need to set up a schedule,
give him a routine.

51:44.511 --> 51:46.143
I can look after him
on my days off. He likes me.

51:46.145 --> 51:48.346
Well, he adores me!

51:49.649 --> 51:51.549
And I think I can find
the time to spend with him.

51:51.551 --> 51:54.084
Uh, I appreciate that.

51:55.322 --> 51:57.221
In fact, why don't I
take one of you up

51:57.223 --> 51:58.889
on that offer right now?

51:58.891 --> 52:00.858
[both]: Oh!

52:07.233 --> 52:09.099
So all of that--

52:09.101 --> 52:11.001
no one knowing
Regina was pregnant,

52:11.003 --> 52:12.470
no baby things
in the house,

52:12.472 --> 52:14.271
no delivering
at a hospital--

52:14.273 --> 52:16.574
it all points to Regina
kidnapping that baby.

52:16.576 --> 52:18.443
But why? They were young,
why not have a kid of their own?

52:18.445 --> 52:20.378
Well, Roe thinks they may
have planned to offer him

52:20.380 --> 52:22.747
to one of those adoption rings
I wrote about a while back.

52:22.749 --> 52:23.815
I read
that story.

52:23.817 --> 52:25.182
You said wealthy couples

52:25.184 --> 52:26.851
who want to bypass
normal channels

52:26.853 --> 52:29.354
might pay $50,000 or more
to get a baby.

52:29.356 --> 52:32.089
I heard of one couple
that paid $200,000.

52:32.091 --> 52:34.859
The woman had
a criminal history.

52:34.861 --> 52:36.561
No judge was going
to approve that adoption.

52:36.563 --> 52:38.529
That might explain
the money in the diaper bag.

52:38.531 --> 52:40.898
Craig and Regina could've
been given a downpayment

52:40.900 --> 52:42.800
to procure a baby.

52:42.802 --> 52:44.301
Why don't I look for
news reports of missing babies?

52:44.303 --> 52:46.738
Well, as the mayor,
I do have connections

52:46.740 --> 52:47.839
inside
the county records office.

52:47.841 --> 52:48.873
He can tell me

52:48.875 --> 52:50.307
if a birth certificate
was filed

52:50.309 --> 52:52.510
with Regina Walker's name on it
anywhere in the state.

52:52.512 --> 52:54.144
I was gonna look into that
at the library tomorrow,

52:54.146 --> 52:55.680
but if you can find it out
faster...

52:55.682 --> 52:58.683
Hey, Roe, didn't Craig's friend
say the money in the diaper bag

52:58.685 --> 52:59.950
was to pay a midwife?

52:59.952 --> 53:02.653
Yeah, but we think
he was lying.

53:02.655 --> 53:03.855
Okay.

53:03.857 --> 53:05.490
I remember,
from my story research,

53:05.492 --> 53:07.759
that there are shady midwives
that couples can pay

53:07.761 --> 53:09.894
to file false
birth certificates.

53:09.896 --> 53:12.263
Well, then we should start
looking into midwives.

53:12.265 --> 53:13.798
Especially the shady kind.

53:13.800 --> 53:16.300
It's too bad Perry Dell
isn't in town.

53:16.302 --> 53:17.769
I'm sure he could
give you some insight

53:17.771 --> 53:18.969
on how to go about that.

53:18.971 --> 53:21.773
Well... we don't have Perry,

53:21.775 --> 53:24.074
but we have his cousin, Jason,
helping us out.

53:24.076 --> 53:25.242
Doing what?

53:25.244 --> 53:27.945
He's helping Martin
track down Rory Brown.

53:31.618 --> 53:34.351
All right, guys, thank you.

53:36.322 --> 53:38.656
Okay, so I figured if Rory
was gonna look up anybody,

53:38.658 --> 53:39.757
it'd be those guys.

53:39.759 --> 53:41.225
And?

53:41.227 --> 53:42.527
They saw him
last night.

53:42.529 --> 53:43.761
Told him he should
go talk to the cops,

53:43.763 --> 53:45.463
that it'd be better
than chasing after them.

53:45.465 --> 53:46.531
Uh-huh.

53:46.533 --> 53:48.065
Rory's not the brightest bulb,
you know?

53:48.067 --> 53:49.233
He was always
a fear-based person,

53:49.235 --> 53:50.435
even back in juvie.

53:50.437 --> 53:53.103
Jason, do these guys know
where Rory is or not?

53:53.105 --> 53:54.872
Yeah. Yeah, they said he's
staying at his old boss's place.

53:54.874 --> 53:56.106
Place called Hollister's.

53:56.108 --> 53:57.041
You know the one?

53:57.043 --> 53:58.543
No, I don't know Hollister's.

53:58.545 --> 54:00.010
Oh, it's a bar down the street.

54:00.012 --> 54:01.178
I think we passed it
on the way.

54:01.180 --> 54:02.079
Okay.

54:02.081 --> 54:02.947
Let's go.

54:06.943 --> 54:08.408
Well, what were the odds
we were gonna find

54:08.410 --> 54:09.543
the midwife's number

54:09.545 --> 54:11.045
just lying around
the house anyway?

54:11.047 --> 54:12.646
Well, it was
worth a shot.

54:12.648 --> 54:14.081
You know, while
we're in Corinth,

54:14.083 --> 54:15.182
I could use a few quotes

54:15.184 --> 54:16.550
from people who knew
Craig and Regina.

54:16.552 --> 54:18.819
Do you mind introducing
me to the neighbors?

54:18.821 --> 54:20.588
Oh. Okay.

54:20.590 --> 54:22.923
Great.

54:22.925 --> 54:24.792
Are they nice?

54:24.794 --> 54:25.960
Yeah.

54:25.962 --> 54:26.927
[doorbell chimes]

54:26.929 --> 54:28.996
Aurora Teagarden. Hello!

54:28.998 --> 54:30.263
Hi.

54:30.265 --> 54:32.099
I hope you're here to tell us
they found Regina.

54:32.101 --> 54:33.467
No, sorry.

54:33.469 --> 54:35.769
I'm here because
my friend, Sally Allison,

54:35.771 --> 54:38.105
she's a reporter for
the Lawrenceton Times.

54:38.107 --> 54:39.673
I was wondering if I could
ask you a few questions,

54:39.675 --> 54:41.341
if you've got a moment?

54:41.343 --> 54:42.309
Oh! The lady
with the baby's here?

54:43.613 --> 54:44.745
You didn't bring the baby
with you?

54:44.747 --> 54:46.714
Oh, no, Cathy. I...

54:46.716 --> 54:49.083
You didn't hand him over
to foster care, did you?

54:49.085 --> 54:50.150
No.

54:50.152 --> 54:51.451
No, he's back
in Lawrenceton.

54:51.453 --> 54:52.486
[relieved sigh]

54:52.488 --> 54:54.822
Who made you
the baby police anyway?

54:54.824 --> 54:56.790
Just because
you don't want kids, Margaret...

54:56.792 --> 54:58.125
Would cramp her style.

54:58.127 --> 54:59.960
Might get in the way
of the big trip to Europe

54:59.962 --> 55:00.961
that they've been planning.

55:00.963 --> 55:02.029
Okay, stop.

55:02.031 --> 55:04.331
Well, I was thinking,

55:04.333 --> 55:06.667
maybe we could just
start with--

55:06.669 --> 55:08.368
Excuse me. I'll be
back in a minute.

55:08.370 --> 55:11.338
There's something I forgot
I need to do next door.

55:11.340 --> 55:14.474
[♪♪♪]

55:14.476 --> 55:17.377
So, we could just start with
your names for the record.

55:17.379 --> 55:18.245
Sure.

55:24.987 --> 55:27.888
[♪♪♪]

55:33.696 --> 55:35.428
[sighs] Electric bill.

55:38.300 --> 55:41.769
[Sally]: You're not sure
the last time you saw Regina,

55:41.771 --> 55:42.970
but what about Craig?

55:42.972 --> 55:44.204
Luther, honey,

55:44.206 --> 55:46.807
we're being interviewed
by the Lawrenceton Times.

55:46.809 --> 55:49.176
Why's that woman climbing
into Craig and Regina's trash?

55:55.317 --> 55:57.751
[♪♪♪]

56:01.924 --> 56:03.657
Cell phone bill!

56:05.394 --> 56:08.962
You know, I think I have
all the information that I need.

56:08.964 --> 56:11.031
Thank you so much for your time.

56:22.144 --> 56:24.211

56:24.213 --> 56:26.180

I don't know you now.

56:36.458 --> 56:39.159
[♪♪♪]

56:40.429 --> 56:43.864
Hey, Bob. Looking for Rory.
Heard he was here.

56:43.866 --> 56:44.932
He is.

56:44.934 --> 56:46.366
Just put him
to work.

56:47.569 --> 56:48.702
Thank you.

56:52.241 --> 56:54.441
Well, if it isn't
Rory Brown.

56:55.644 --> 56:57.711
Jason Dell!
Are you kidding me?

56:57.713 --> 56:59.279
-We got--
-[slam]

57:01.450 --> 57:04.885
[Martin]: Rory, open the door!
I just want to talk to you!

57:04.887 --> 57:06.120
Just leave me alone!

57:06.122 --> 57:07.788
[Jason]: Come on, Rory,
just talk to the guy!

57:10.192 --> 57:12.359
He's going out the window.

57:22.972 --> 57:25.405
[♪♪♪]

57:32.014 --> 57:35.015
[Sally]: So Craig called that
midwife four times in one day?

57:35.017 --> 57:37.317
[Aurora]: That's why
I called that number first.

57:37.319 --> 57:38.585
Okay, but if he called
that many times,

57:38.587 --> 57:40.287
doesn't that seem like
a husband nervous

57:40.289 --> 57:41.955
because his wife is in labor?

57:41.957 --> 57:44.591
Or a man nervous that his wife
just kidnapped a baby,

57:44.593 --> 57:46.593
and needs a midwife
to file a fake birth certificate

57:46.595 --> 57:49.296
so they can pretend that
they're giving their own kid up

57:49.298 --> 57:50.664
to the illegal adoption ring.

57:50.666 --> 57:52.800
But Terry told us
her contact at county services

57:52.802 --> 57:55.002
didn't find a birth certificate
anywhere in the state

57:55.004 --> 57:56.270
for a "Hayden Walker."

57:57.639 --> 57:59.706
Maybe the midwife wouldn't
file the birth certificate

57:59.708 --> 58:01.675
until Craig
gave her enough money.

58:01.677 --> 58:03.777
Maybe Rory was telling
the truth about that.

58:03.779 --> 58:06.780
[♪♪♪]

58:09.885 --> 58:11.952
That looks like Rory.

58:11.954 --> 58:13.586
Is that Jason?

58:15.524 --> 58:16.723
[brakes screech]

58:23.365 --> 58:25.398
[♪♪♪]

58:29.305 --> 58:31.071
I could've killed you!

58:31.073 --> 58:33.307
Yeah. Thank you for stopping.

58:34.443 --> 58:36.944
What are you two
doing in Corinth?

58:36.946 --> 58:38.578
Well, we're trying
to find the midwife

58:38.580 --> 58:39.813
Rory was talking about.

58:39.815 --> 58:40.848
We have a pretty good lead.

58:40.850 --> 58:42.282
Wait, I thought
you didn't believe

58:42.284 --> 58:43.516
Regina delivered that baby.

58:43.518 --> 58:45.719
She doesn't.

58:45.721 --> 58:47.087
She thinks Craig
was going to pay the midwife

58:47.089 --> 58:48.956
to give them
a fake birth certificate

58:48.958 --> 58:50.390
that they could use
to put the baby they kidnapped

58:50.392 --> 58:51.992
up for adoption.

58:51.994 --> 58:53.360
[sighing] Roe...

58:53.362 --> 58:54.794
I know.

58:54.796 --> 58:56.196
The little girl
you carried on your back

58:56.198 --> 58:57.697
could never do
something like that.

58:57.699 --> 58:59.699
You know, I could try

58:59.701 --> 59:01.434
some of my contacts to see
if she has any connections

59:01.436 --> 59:02.402
with private
adoption attorneys.

59:02.404 --> 59:03.670
Yes, please do that.

59:05.741 --> 59:07.107
He got away from me.

59:07.109 --> 59:09.676
Man, that kid
is fast.

59:09.678 --> 59:10.710
Well, thanks
for trying.

59:10.712 --> 59:12.212
He must know something
really messed up

59:12.214 --> 59:14.047
to make him
run that fast.

59:15.284 --> 59:16.850
What if he was running

59:16.852 --> 59:19.619
because he's the one
that did something messed up?

59:19.621 --> 59:22.155
Maybe we were too quick
to rule him out as a suspect.

59:22.157 --> 59:24.424
What if he's involved
in the adoption ring,

59:24.426 --> 59:28.728
and he got in a fight with Craig
over dividing up the cash?

59:28.730 --> 59:30.430
I don't know.
Rory's sketchy,

59:30.432 --> 59:31.431
but he's really not
that kind of guy.

59:31.433 --> 59:33.133
Yeah, but can you be sure?

59:34.937 --> 59:36.370
Got a text from Arthur.

59:36.372 --> 59:38.471
Wants to meet me.

59:38.473 --> 59:41.074
Maybe he knows
something about Regina.

59:41.076 --> 59:43.543
"We can meet at..."
your house?

59:43.545 --> 59:45.445
Okay.

59:45.447 --> 59:47.614
Something just
isn't adding up.

59:52.309 --> 59:54.108
[Arthur]: So we know the type
of hunting rifle

59:54.110 --> 59:55.444
Craig's killer used,

59:55.446 --> 59:56.945
and we have the model
of the tires from the vehicle

59:56.947 --> 59:58.513
used to transport Regina.

59:58.515 --> 59:59.815
Plus, we have an APB
out on Rory Brown,

59:59.817 --> 01:00:01.683
which wouldn't
have been necessary

01:00:01.685 --> 01:00:04.085
if you had called
when you found him.

01:00:04.087 --> 01:00:06.421
Well, if I do find him,
you'll be the first to know.

01:00:06.423 --> 01:00:07.722
Oh, I don't want you
looking for him.

01:00:07.724 --> 01:00:09.324
You're just pushing him
further into hiding.

01:00:09.326 --> 01:00:10.926
He's more afraid of you
than he is of me.

01:00:12.062 --> 01:00:13.628
-[frustrated chuckle]
-Okay.

01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:14.863
Okay, okay.

01:00:14.865 --> 01:00:17.432
We also got the results back
from the DNA test.

01:00:17.434 --> 01:00:19.501
Baby Hayden is definitely
related to Martin.

01:00:19.503 --> 01:00:21.035
He's Regina's baby.

01:00:21.037 --> 01:00:22.303
So it wasn't
a kidnapping.

01:00:22.305 --> 01:00:24.506
That doesn't make sense.

01:00:24.508 --> 01:00:27.175
Nobody knew
she was pregnant.

01:00:27.177 --> 01:00:29.177
The birth
wasn't registered.

01:00:29.179 --> 01:00:31.012
So Rory was
telling the truth,

01:00:31.014 --> 01:00:33.715
she did use a midwife
for the delivery.

01:00:33.717 --> 01:00:34.683
That phone bill
that you found

01:00:34.685 --> 01:00:35.984
at Regina's house--

01:00:35.986 --> 01:00:37.118
What phone bill?

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.487
Um, I was gonna
give it to you.

01:00:38.489 --> 01:00:40.355
I was!

01:00:40.357 --> 01:00:42.824
I found it stuck to the side
of a trash can.

01:00:42.826 --> 01:00:45.193
I called the number
right there.

01:00:45.195 --> 01:00:46.962
It belongs to a midwife
named Bobbie Sunday.

01:00:46.964 --> 01:00:49.865
She's in Taborville,
it's between here and Corinth.

01:00:49.867 --> 01:00:52.066
So maybe the midwife

01:00:52.068 --> 01:00:53.668
waited to register
baby Hayden's birth

01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:54.803
until she got
what she was owed.

01:00:56.272 --> 01:00:58.339
Well, that's the first question
I'm gonna ask her tomorrow.

01:00:58.341 --> 01:00:59.407
No!

01:00:59.409 --> 01:01:00.976
Do not go
and talk to the midwife.

01:01:00.978 --> 01:01:02.544
No medical practitioner
can legally

01:01:02.546 --> 01:01:04.112
give you any information
on a patient.

01:01:04.114 --> 01:01:06.648
It's called confidentiality.
Maybe you've heard of it?

01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:08.683
We'll get a subpoena
for Regina's records

01:01:08.685 --> 01:01:09.751
in the morning,

01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:11.152
but thank you
for passing this on.

01:01:11.154 --> 01:01:12.587
[Arthur quietly
clears his throat]

01:01:13.857 --> 01:01:15.289
Oh, yes.

01:01:15.291 --> 01:01:18.393
Thank you, Roe, for
your trash-digging talents.

01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:21.162
Really?

01:01:23.734 --> 01:01:25.033
Listen.

01:01:25.035 --> 01:01:27.301
I will call you as soon as
we learn anything new.

01:01:27.303 --> 01:01:29.170
Okay?

01:01:34.411 --> 01:01:35.777
You're gonna
go to Corinth

01:01:35.779 --> 01:01:37.512
to try and find Rory
tonight, aren't you?

01:01:43.921 --> 01:01:48.857
[♪♪♪]

01:01:54.364 --> 01:01:55.664
[Aurora]: I have to say,

01:01:55.666 --> 01:01:58.266
it's really nice
having a baby around.

01:01:58.268 --> 01:01:59.701
Yes.

01:01:59.703 --> 01:02:01.937
Babies make
your heart grow.

01:02:03.173 --> 01:02:04.338
[weary sigh]

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:06.441
It's also exhausting
having a baby around.

01:02:06.443 --> 01:02:09.544
I never knew how much time
and effort they take.

01:02:09.546 --> 01:02:10.645
Even when he's sleeping,

01:02:10.647 --> 01:02:11.813
I feel like
I can't leave the room.

01:02:11.815 --> 01:02:14.783
Which... is why
I got you these.

01:02:17.287 --> 01:02:18.587
Mother...

01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:22.090
This may be the best gift
you have ever given me.

01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:29.831
[♪♪♪]

01:02:34.871 --> 01:02:37.939
I just talked to a guy
who saw Rory about an hour ago.

01:02:37.941 --> 01:02:39.107
He was buying beer at a market
on the East side of town.

01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.975
That's where
we'll head to next.

01:02:39.977 --> 01:02:41.009
All right.

01:02:41.011 --> 01:02:42.944
[♪♪♪]

01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:49.317
[phone ringing]

01:03:03.233 --> 01:03:04.966
Hello?

01:03:04.968 --> 01:03:06.635
Roe? Did I wake you?

01:03:06.637 --> 01:03:07.836
Mm-hmm.

01:03:07.838 --> 01:03:09.971
<i>Never mind, one of</i>
<i>my sources just told me</i>

01:03:09.973 --> 01:03:11.873
that Bobbie Sunday
has been investigated twice

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:13.274
for filing inaccurate
birth certificates

01:03:13.276 --> 01:03:15.243
in private adoptions.

01:03:15.245 --> 01:03:17.112
Really? Okay,
then we shouldn't wait

01:03:17.114 --> 01:03:18.813
for Arthur
to get that subpoena.

01:03:18.815 --> 01:03:19.914
<i>Well, I'm ready</i>
<i>to go talk to her</i>

01:03:19.916 --> 01:03:21.215
<i>whenever you are.</i>

01:03:21.217 --> 01:03:23.084
Uh, okay, yeah,

01:03:23.086 --> 01:03:25.553
it'll just take me a minute
to get the baby ready

01:03:25.555 --> 01:03:27.388
<i>and drop him off</i>
<i>at Mother's.</i>

01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:28.523
Just have
John go with you now,

01:03:28.525 --> 01:03:29.758
and I'll get there
as soon as I can.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.659
Okay. Great.

01:03:39.502 --> 01:03:41.369
What in the world?

01:03:51.081 --> 01:03:52.781
I'm with the press.

01:03:52.783 --> 01:03:54.649
Thank you.

01:03:59.455 --> 01:04:02.857
That's the best number
to reach me at.

01:04:02.859 --> 01:04:05.060
Excuse me,
are you Bobbie Sunday?

01:04:05.062 --> 01:04:06.027
Yes.

01:04:06.029 --> 01:04:07.328
Hi. I'm Sally Allison.

01:04:07.330 --> 01:04:09.130
I'm a reporter with
<i>the Lawrenceton Times.</i>

01:04:09.132 --> 01:04:11.199
This is my associate,
John Queensland.

01:04:11.201 --> 01:04:13.201
Can you tell us
what happened here?

01:04:13.203 --> 01:04:16.805
Uh, the police officer said
it was a burglary.

01:04:16.807 --> 01:04:18.139
Or vandalism.

01:04:18.141 --> 01:04:19.440
Or both.

01:04:19.442 --> 01:04:20.575
[sighs]

01:04:20.577 --> 01:04:23.211
My records room
has been ransacked.

01:04:23.213 --> 01:04:25.947
Why are you so interested
in my office?

01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:27.515
Because whoever broke
into your office

01:04:27.517 --> 01:04:30.318
might be
looking to hurt... you.

01:04:32.956 --> 01:04:35.289
[♪♪♪]

01:04:38.394 --> 01:04:39.627
[Sally]:
Oh, good, Roe's here.

01:04:39.629 --> 01:04:41.529
I got here as fast
as I could.

01:04:41.531 --> 01:04:43.798
Who would do such a thing?
And why?

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:44.799
Bobbie, hi.

01:04:44.801 --> 01:04:45.967
I'm Aurora Teagarden.

01:04:45.969 --> 01:04:47.802
Another associate of mine.

01:04:47.804 --> 01:04:49.904
I'm so sorry
that this has happened,

01:04:49.906 --> 01:04:51.139
but we believe
the break-in

01:04:51.141 --> 01:04:52.273
was to cover

01:04:52.275 --> 01:04:54.008
the tracks of the person
that killed Craig Walker

01:04:54.010 --> 01:04:54.943
in Lawrenceton

01:04:54.945 --> 01:04:56.577
and kidnapped his wife, Regina.

01:04:56.579 --> 01:04:57.979
You knew them...

01:04:57.981 --> 01:05:00.581
didn't you?

01:05:00.583 --> 01:05:02.050
We also believe

01:05:02.052 --> 01:05:04.185
that the murder also involved
their baby,

01:05:04.187 --> 01:05:06.921
a baby
we think you delivered.

01:05:08.625 --> 01:05:10.225
Look... [sighs]

01:05:10.227 --> 01:05:11.960
I don't want any trouble.

01:05:11.962 --> 01:05:13.094
Bobbie, we just
want to help you.

01:05:13.096 --> 01:05:14.295
And protect you.

01:05:14.297 --> 01:05:16.430
So, please, tell us.

01:05:16.432 --> 01:05:18.599
Did you deliver
Craig and Regina's baby?

01:05:20.403 --> 01:05:21.803
Yes.

01:05:21.805 --> 01:05:23.872
Why didn't
you register the birth?

01:05:23.874 --> 01:05:25.807
Was it because
they owed you money?

01:05:25.809 --> 01:05:28.342
Or because they wanted to put
the baby up for adoption?

01:05:30.113 --> 01:05:31.146
That. Yes.

01:05:32.382 --> 01:05:33.314
To whom?

01:05:33.316 --> 01:05:34.415
[sighing wearily]

01:05:34.417 --> 01:05:35.683
I don't know.

01:05:35.685 --> 01:05:37.886
Regina was supposed to call
and give me the name

01:05:37.888 --> 01:05:39.420
of the adoptive parents,

01:05:39.422 --> 01:05:41.122
so I could put them
on the birth certificate.

01:05:41.124 --> 01:05:42.690
But she never did.

01:05:42.692 --> 01:05:44.793
She never did?
Not a lawyer?

01:05:44.795 --> 01:05:47.996
She didn't want
to involve lawyers.

01:05:47.998 --> 01:05:50.298
Look, these are people
she knew in Corinth.

01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:53.234
She said-- she said they'd give
the baby a good home.

01:05:53.236 --> 01:05:54.335
And they wanted to be able

01:05:54.337 --> 01:05:56.805
to raise him
as their biological child.

01:05:56.807 --> 01:05:58.072
Did she say why?

01:05:58.074 --> 01:06:00.175
No. But, uh...

01:06:00.177 --> 01:06:02.310
she was supposed to be
getting a lot of money.

01:06:02.312 --> 01:06:03.411
And she was supposed
to give you a cut?

01:06:03.413 --> 01:06:05.346
Then she didn't?

01:06:06.749 --> 01:06:08.216
No. She didn't.

01:06:08.218 --> 01:06:11.319
But I haven't done
anything wrong.

01:06:11.321 --> 01:06:13.321
Technically, not yet.

01:06:13.323 --> 01:06:15.556
That's why Regina
concealed the pregnancy

01:06:15.558 --> 01:06:17.058
and didn't buy anything
for the baby.

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:18.693
Because she and Craig
were gonna

01:06:18.695 --> 01:06:20.394
put the baby up
for a private adoption.

01:06:20.396 --> 01:06:22.496
Then Regina changed her mind and
took off with the baby.

01:06:22.498 --> 01:06:24.365
The adoptive
parents probably

01:06:24.367 --> 01:06:26.467
followed him straight
to Regina and the baby

01:06:26.469 --> 01:06:27.501
at my house.

01:06:27.503 --> 01:06:29.137
Then Craig tried
to defend his family,

01:06:29.139 --> 01:06:30.538
and they killed him.

01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:32.606
[Sally]: And then they took
Regina to make her tell them

01:06:32.608 --> 01:06:34.542
where the baby is.

01:06:34.544 --> 01:06:36.878
Okay, but why do they want
to hurt me?

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.779
I mean, I don't even know
who they are.

01:06:40.951 --> 01:06:42.516
Maybe you know more
than you think.

01:06:43.854 --> 01:06:46.921
Did you ever hear Regina
mention the name Cathy Davis?

01:06:46.923 --> 01:06:49.357
[Bobbie exhales]

01:06:49.359 --> 01:06:52.093
Yes. I think that was
the name of the woman

01:06:52.095 --> 01:06:54.695
who drove Regina to one
of her prenatal appointments.

01:06:54.697 --> 01:06:56.664
[♪♪♪]

01:07:02.805 --> 01:07:05.104
Thank you.

01:07:06.274 --> 01:07:08.007
Thanks, man.

01:07:08.009 --> 01:07:09.209
Hey, Rory.

01:07:11.747 --> 01:07:13.747
[♪♪♪]

01:07:17.353 --> 01:07:18.752
Nowhere left to run, Rory.

01:07:23.625 --> 01:07:25.525
I quoted her
for my story!

01:07:26.662 --> 01:07:28.061
Cathy Davis.

01:07:28.063 --> 01:07:30.430
Saying she had no idea
that Regina was pregnant.

01:07:30.432 --> 01:07:32.298
It's in the paper
this morning.

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:34.835
And yet she was taking her
to prenatal appointments.

01:07:34.837 --> 01:07:37.136
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

01:07:38.273 --> 01:07:41.007
Okay, Corinth P.D. says

01:07:41.009 --> 01:07:43.176
there's no one home
at the Davis residence.

01:07:43.178 --> 01:07:44.511
Neighbor told them

01:07:44.513 --> 01:07:46.312
that Cathy and her husband
left last night

01:07:46.314 --> 01:07:47.881
for an out-of-town trip.

01:07:49.184 --> 01:07:50.784
But what if
they planned

01:07:50.786 --> 01:07:52.686
to keep on driving
to Lawrenceton?

01:07:52.688 --> 01:07:53.820
They know
Hayden's there!

01:07:53.822 --> 01:07:55.756
They could be
looking for him.

01:07:55.758 --> 01:07:57.290
I need to get back
to the baby.

01:07:57.292 --> 01:07:58.392
I'll call Lynn
and make sure

01:07:58.394 --> 01:08:00.093
there's an officer
posted up at your house.

01:08:00.095 --> 01:08:01.795
Thank you,
and I'll call my mother,

01:08:01.797 --> 01:08:02.929
warn her, too.

01:08:02.931 --> 01:08:04.297
We'll stay with you
for a bit.

01:08:04.299 --> 01:08:06.600
[phone ringing]

01:08:06.602 --> 01:08:07.768
<i>Martin, hi.</i>

01:08:07.770 --> 01:08:09.636
Hey! Finally got Rory.

01:08:09.638 --> 01:08:11.471
I'm about to haul him
back to Lawrenceton,

01:08:11.473 --> 01:08:13.206
to hand him over
to Lynn and Arthur.

01:08:13.208 --> 01:08:14.508
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>Lawrenceton's</i>

01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:15.876
<i>a good place</i>
<i>to be right now.</i>

01:08:15.878 --> 01:08:17.676
Do remember the woman
I told you about?

01:08:17.679 --> 01:08:21.014
The friend of Regina's neighbor
who kept asking to hold Hayden?

01:08:21.015 --> 01:08:22.416
Yeah, what about her?

01:08:22.417 --> 01:08:25.350
<i>She might be the killer,</i>
<i>and I think she's headed there.</i>

01:08:29.925 --> 01:08:32.225
[♪♪♪]

01:08:36.932 --> 01:08:40.600
Oh, you are such a good baby.

01:08:40.602 --> 01:08:41.734
Yes, you are!

01:08:41.737 --> 01:08:42.836
[cell phone ringing]

01:08:42.837 --> 01:08:45.839
I'll be finished
in just a moment, Aida.

01:08:45.841 --> 01:08:50.209
Oh, actually, Lillian,
my appointment canceled,

01:08:50.211 --> 01:08:53.046
so, uh, I'll just keep Hayden
the rest of the day.

01:08:53.048 --> 01:08:54.981
But it's my turn
to watch him.

01:08:54.983 --> 01:08:58.885
I plan to play my Mozart CDs,
to increase his intelligence.

01:08:58.886 --> 01:09:00.987
I doubt that passive listening
will do that.

01:09:00.988 --> 01:09:04.023
No, no. He needs
a more stimulating toy.

01:09:04.024 --> 01:09:06.059
Like this one.

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:07.560
Oh, that flashing thing

01:09:07.563 --> 01:09:09.429
will give him a taste
for common entertainments.

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:11.465
We want him to be
more discerning, don't we?

01:09:11.466 --> 01:09:13.667
Are you calling
my tastes "common"?

01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:18.404
Mother, thank you
for keeping an eye on him.

01:09:18.406 --> 01:09:20.474
Hi, sweet boy.

01:09:20.475 --> 01:09:22.908
Lillian, I need
to take a sick day.

01:09:22.911 --> 01:09:24.578
Oh. You look fine to me.

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:26.011
Call it
a "family emergency."

01:09:26.014 --> 01:09:27.080
An emergency?

01:09:27.082 --> 01:09:28.281
What is
going on, Aurora?

01:09:28.283 --> 01:09:30.283
I'll call you later,
fill you in.

01:09:39.595 --> 01:09:41.260
Hey. I was getting
worried about you.

01:09:41.261 --> 01:09:42.395
Yeah, I tried
to call you to tell you

01:09:42.397 --> 01:09:43.796
I was almost here.

01:09:45.033 --> 01:09:46.666
Phone's out of juice.

01:09:46.667 --> 01:09:48.702
Where's Jason?

01:09:48.703 --> 01:09:50.103
His friend came
to pick him up.

01:09:50.104 --> 01:09:51.270
He's done enough.

01:09:51.272 --> 01:09:52.572
Besides, it's getting
too dangerous.

01:09:52.573 --> 01:09:55.609
Which is why you may want
to get me out of the house.

01:09:55.611 --> 01:09:57.143
Not until you tell me
who has Regina,

01:09:57.145 --> 01:09:59.880
or the Lawrenceton cops
come to get you.

01:09:59.882 --> 01:10:01.047
Those are your options.

01:10:01.049 --> 01:10:02.448
How many times
do I have to tell you, okay?

01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:04.217
I don't know who took her.

01:10:04.219 --> 01:10:05.785
Can you--

01:10:07.188 --> 01:10:08.522
Rory.

01:10:08.524 --> 01:10:11.124
I just talked to the midwife
who delivered Hayden.

01:10:11.126 --> 01:10:14.694
She told me that Regina planned
to put the baby up for adoption.

01:10:17.499 --> 01:10:18.965
She told you?

01:10:18.967 --> 01:10:20.099
A private adoption

01:10:20.101 --> 01:10:22.002
that nobody else
was supposed to know about.

01:10:22.004 --> 01:10:23.637
Except you knew
about it.

01:10:23.639 --> 01:10:27.106
And you also knew that
Regina changed her mind

01:10:27.108 --> 01:10:28.474
after she and Craig
already spent

01:10:28.476 --> 01:10:30.777
whatever money
they'd been given.

01:10:30.779 --> 01:10:32.546
So that's why
you and Craig

01:10:32.548 --> 01:10:34.180
started to write bad checks.

01:10:35.551 --> 01:10:38.585
Craig was scared.
He wanted to pay them back.

01:10:38.587 --> 01:10:39.719
Pay who off?

01:10:39.721 --> 01:10:40.754
I told you,

01:10:40.756 --> 01:10:42.989
I-I don't know who.

01:10:42.991 --> 01:10:44.390
I think
I know who.

01:10:44.392 --> 01:10:47.093
It was the woman who drove
Regina to the midwife once.

01:10:47.095 --> 01:10:48.461
A woman by the name
of Cathy Davis.

01:10:50.165 --> 01:10:52.599
You know who that is,
don't you?

01:10:53.802 --> 01:10:55.569
Tell us what
you know, Rory.

01:10:55.571 --> 01:10:59.072
Were Cathy Davis and her husband
supposed to adopt Hayden?

01:10:59.074 --> 01:11:01.074
Is that
who has Regina?

01:11:05.413 --> 01:11:08.782
If I tell you that...
I am as good as dead.

01:11:08.784 --> 01:11:12.085
So just let me
out of this house, okay? Please!

01:11:12.087 --> 01:11:13.419
Shh, you're gonna
wake the baby.

01:11:13.421 --> 01:11:16.056
Do you want to put him
in the bedroom?

01:11:16.058 --> 01:11:17.791
[Aurora]: Yeah.

01:11:22.497 --> 01:11:25.599
All right, look.
Rory, it's gonna be okay.

01:11:25.601 --> 01:11:27.000
It's not
gonna be okay.

01:11:27.002 --> 01:11:28.001
Okay?

01:11:28.003 --> 01:11:29.869
It is so not gonna be okay!

01:11:29.871 --> 01:11:31.938
If we can catch
whoever did this,

01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:33.106
then you can go home.

01:11:33.108 --> 01:11:34.207
[Rory on monitor]:
<i>I'll feel safe</i>

01:11:34.209 --> 01:11:36.943
<i>when you let me</i>
<i>out of this house.</i>

01:11:36.945 --> 01:11:38.812
[Martin]: <i> If you don't</i>
<i>feel safe telling me,</i>

01:11:38.814 --> 01:11:40.346
<i>why not tell the police, huh?</i>

01:11:40.348 --> 01:11:42.448
They'll bring you
into protective custody.

01:11:42.450 --> 01:11:43.783
Yeah, they'll never
let me out of jail.

01:11:43.785 --> 01:11:45.485
Just let me out of this house.

01:11:45.487 --> 01:11:46.686
<i>Please?</i>

01:11:46.688 --> 01:11:48.788
<i>I can't do that</i>
<i>because you won't tell me--</i>

01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:50.490
-...who has Regina.
-It's her own fault!

01:11:50.492 --> 01:11:51.524
Not mine.

01:11:51.526 --> 01:11:53.693
Everything that happened,
it's on her!

01:11:53.695 --> 01:11:55.161
-[shot rings out]
-Ah!

[Rory groaning on baby monitor]

01:11:58.366 --> 01:11:59.265
I got shot!

01:12:01.637 --> 01:12:02.368
Get down!

01:12:05.306 --> 01:12:06.472

01:12:09.377 --> 01:12:10.243

01:12:15.717 --> 01:12:17.784
Martin! Oh... Martin.

01:12:17.786 --> 01:12:21.220
No, don't. Martin, talk to me.
Talk to me.

01:12:21.222 --> 01:12:22.388
I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.

01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:24.257
Rory.

01:12:27.929 --> 01:12:29.996
[♪♪♪]

01:12:29.998 --> 01:12:32.231
Roe. Get over here.

01:12:32.233 --> 01:12:34.167
He's breathing. I think
the bullet just grazed him,

01:12:34.169 --> 01:12:35.535
but he's passed out.

01:12:35.537 --> 01:12:36.903
Listen. A red shirt.

01:12:36.905 --> 01:12:39.105
I saw
a red-checked shirt.

01:12:39.107 --> 01:12:40.740
I have to stop that bleeding.

01:12:45.814 --> 01:12:47.881
Listen to me, Roe.

01:12:47.883 --> 01:12:49.482
I'm probably gonna
go into shock,

01:12:49.484 --> 01:12:50.483
just so you know.

01:12:51.653 --> 01:12:52.686
Martin--

01:12:52.688 --> 01:12:54.187
Hold this.

01:12:54.189 --> 01:12:56.489
I need to call 911.

01:12:58.293 --> 01:13:01.227
Oh! My phone!
It's in the car.

01:13:03.565 --> 01:13:04.998
Is everything okay?

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.200
It's Luther Granberry,
from across the street!

Hey. I thought
I heard gunshots.

01:13:13.241 --> 01:13:14.140
Is everything
all right?

01:13:14.142 --> 01:13:15.075
Yeah. Yeah.

01:13:15.077 --> 01:13:16.576
Aw, no.

01:13:16.578 --> 01:13:17.977
Oh, you've got hurt people.

01:13:17.979 --> 01:13:19.378
Okay, uh...

01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:20.947
I got a first-aid kit
in my truck.

01:13:20.949 --> 01:13:22.348
I'll run and get it.

01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:24.250
And call 911
so I can stay with Martin.

01:13:24.252 --> 01:13:25.418
[exhales]

01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:28.054
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay.

01:13:28.056 --> 01:13:29.856
Uh, I'll be right back.

01:13:31.359 --> 01:13:32.192
Roe.

01:13:34.930 --> 01:13:36.830

01:13:40.969 --> 01:13:42.769
Martin!

01:13:42.771 --> 01:13:44.470
Martin, he was wearing

01:13:44.472 --> 01:13:46.039
a red-checked shirt
underneath his jacket.

01:13:48.877 --> 01:13:51.211
Roe! Come back here!

<i>Come on, sweet baby.</i>

01:14:19.374 --> 01:14:21.374
<i>Time to come home.</i>

01:14:27.849 --> 01:14:28.915

01:14:28.917 --> 01:14:31.217
Give me Hayden.

01:14:31.219 --> 01:14:33.052
His name is Trevor.

01:14:34.984 --> 01:14:36.650
You sure you don't
want us to stay

01:14:36.652 --> 01:14:38.219
until your sister
gets here?

01:14:38.221 --> 01:14:39.586
No, the police
are still here.

01:14:39.588 --> 01:14:40.988
I'll be okay.

01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:42.390
Okay, one more thing.

01:14:42.392 --> 01:14:44.892
My editor's gonna want a photo
to go along with my story,

01:14:44.894 --> 01:14:46.360
and I found some pictures
of Cathy Davis

01:14:46.362 --> 01:14:47.561
from her online profile.

01:14:47.563 --> 01:14:49.663
This is the woman
who brought Regina

01:14:49.665 --> 01:14:51.098
to her appointment, right?

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:52.466
No, not her.

01:14:52.468 --> 01:14:53.267
It was this woman.

01:14:55.805 --> 01:14:59.106
Margaret Granberry
used Cathy Davis's name.

01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:01.309
Hey, you got a minute?

01:15:01.311 --> 01:15:03.377
I just got a message
from Sally Allison,

01:15:03.379 --> 01:15:04.445
saying Cathy Davis

01:15:04.447 --> 01:15:06.347
is not the person
we should be looking at.

01:15:06.349 --> 01:15:08.316
Yeah, well, she's right.
Have a look at this.

01:15:08.318 --> 01:15:09.750
A list of customers
from Corinth Tires,

01:15:09.752 --> 01:15:10.918
people who bought

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.653
the model of tire
that matches the tracks we found

01:15:12.655 --> 01:15:13.754
next to Regina's car.

01:15:13.756 --> 01:15:15.356
You see a name
that looks familiar?

01:15:17.226 --> 01:15:19.360
Luther Granberry?

01:15:19.362 --> 01:15:20.694
You want to call Corinth P.D.,
or should I?

01:15:20.696 --> 01:15:23.530
You're the lead detective
on this case, aren't you?

01:15:23.532 --> 01:15:26.167
Yes, Chief, I am.

01:15:32.041 --> 01:15:33.740
Regina!

01:15:35.778 --> 01:15:38.012
The Granberrys'
basement.

01:15:38.014 --> 01:15:40.314
Is this is where
you've been the whole time?

01:15:40.316 --> 01:15:42.016
Yeah. I thought
I heard Hayden crying.

01:15:42.018 --> 01:15:43.917
Is he here?

01:15:43.919 --> 01:15:46.653
Yes. Yeah, Margaret has him.

01:15:46.655 --> 01:15:47.554
I'm so sorry.

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:53.027
I was hoping
to keep him away from them,

01:15:53.029 --> 01:15:54.295
but...

01:15:54.297 --> 01:15:56.697
they said that
once Craig and Rory brought him,

01:15:56.699 --> 01:15:58.432
they'd let me go.

01:15:58.434 --> 01:16:00.601
So...

01:16:00.603 --> 01:16:02.136
They'll be really good
to Hayden, though,

01:16:02.138 --> 01:16:03.804
won't they?

01:16:03.806 --> 01:16:05.206
I mean,
they must love him

01:16:05.208 --> 01:16:07.708
to go through all this trouble
just to get him back.

01:16:07.710 --> 01:16:09.443
It'll be hard
without Hayden,

01:16:09.445 --> 01:16:12.279
but Craig and I still
have each other,

01:16:12.281 --> 01:16:14.448
right?

01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:16.650
Oh, Regina,
I am so sorry

01:16:16.652 --> 01:16:19.353
to say this, but...

01:16:19.355 --> 01:16:22.156
Craig is dead.

01:16:25.428 --> 01:16:28.029
No.

01:16:28.031 --> 01:16:31.065
No, Craig is fine.

01:16:31.067 --> 01:16:34.402
No. I-I saw him
in front of your house.

01:16:34.404 --> 01:16:36.337
He was talking
to Luther.

01:16:36.339 --> 01:16:39.873
I convinced them that Rory was
just taking the baby for a walk,

01:16:39.875 --> 01:16:42.410
but I had Hayden hidden
in the bathtub.

01:16:42.412 --> 01:16:43.844
Luther promised

01:16:43.846 --> 01:16:46.680
that he wouldn't hurt Craig
if I went with Margaret, so--

01:16:46.682 --> 01:16:48.715
Luther broke his promise.

01:16:50.486 --> 01:16:52.853
He shot Craig.

01:16:52.855 --> 01:16:55.423
I'm so sorry.

01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:59.060
Craig must have tried
to overpower Luther,

01:16:59.062 --> 01:17:01.095
and Luther panicked...

01:17:01.097 --> 01:17:03.431
he shot him.

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.368
Craig didn't bring the baby?

01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:09.537
No.

01:17:10.773 --> 01:17:12.940
[♪♪♪]

01:17:16.679 --> 01:17:18.345
[sobs]

01:17:22.218 --> 01:17:25.986
Luther just shot Martin
and Rory through the window.

01:17:25.988 --> 01:17:27.555
I don't know
how bad it is,

01:17:27.557 --> 01:17:29.690
and I wasn't able
to call an ambulance.

01:17:29.692 --> 01:17:32.259
We have to get out of here.

01:17:34.029 --> 01:17:37.565
[gasps weakly]

01:17:39.368 --> 01:17:40.401
Rory.

01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:45.772
Rory.

01:17:47.042 --> 01:17:48.041
Rory!

01:17:50.113 --> 01:17:54.115
Ah, you're gonna
be fine.

01:17:54.117 --> 01:17:57.751
Back pocket.

01:18:05.194 --> 01:18:06.860
<i>[line ringing]</i>

01:18:06.862 --> 01:18:10.464
I thought I was
doing a good thing.

01:18:10.466 --> 01:18:12.566
We weren't ready
to have a baby.

01:18:12.568 --> 01:18:15.603
Craig didn't
even have a job.

01:18:15.605 --> 01:18:19.373
Luther and Margaret
wanted a baby so badly.

01:18:19.375 --> 01:18:21.442
But she couldn't.

01:18:21.444 --> 01:18:24.612
They'd been trying to adopt
and they'd saved all this money,

01:18:24.614 --> 01:18:26.947
but they kept getting
turned down

01:18:26.949 --> 01:18:29.416
because Luther
had been in prison.

01:18:32.188 --> 01:18:34.555
We thought
he deserved a second chance.

01:18:34.557 --> 01:18:35.922
I mean,
Craig had been in prison,

01:18:35.924 --> 01:18:37.991
and he was nice.

01:18:39.195 --> 01:18:42.062
Luther and Margaret
seemed so nice, too.

01:18:43.332 --> 01:18:45.732
They are not
nice people, Regina.

01:18:45.734 --> 01:18:47.968
They would do anything
to cover their tracks,

01:18:47.970 --> 01:18:49.703
even if it means killing us.

01:18:49.705 --> 01:18:51.872
We have to get out of here.

01:18:53.108 --> 01:18:55.276
Let them kill me then.
I don't care.

01:18:55.278 --> 01:18:56.610
I don't want to live
without Craig.

01:18:56.612 --> 01:18:58.546
Hey. Hey!

01:18:58.548 --> 01:19:01.014
Listen to me.

01:19:01.016 --> 01:19:03.016
Your baby is upstairs.

01:19:03.018 --> 01:19:04.552
Do you really
want Hayden being raised

01:19:04.554 --> 01:19:06.019
by the people
who killed his father?

01:19:08.558 --> 01:19:11.358
Then you need
to help me figure this out.

01:19:13.862 --> 01:19:15.362
I've tried everything
I can think of

01:19:15.364 --> 01:19:17.198
to get out of here.

01:19:21.136 --> 01:19:23.170
Just last month,
I read about a case

01:19:23.172 --> 01:19:25.272
in which three women

01:19:25.274 --> 01:19:26.773
were trapped
in a basement,

01:19:26.775 --> 01:19:29.042
and they managed
to escape.

01:19:29.044 --> 01:19:31.011
They used a ruse.

01:19:32.281 --> 01:19:34.548
[♪♪♪]

01:19:41.156 --> 01:19:45.158
Aren't you going
to come admire your new son?

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.194
[chuckles]

01:19:47.196 --> 01:19:48.829
I'll be able to more later.

01:19:48.831 --> 01:19:50.197
We gotta get outta here now.

01:19:50.199 --> 01:19:51.565
Just a matter of time

01:19:51.567 --> 01:19:53.667
before the cops show up
and check out those gunshots.

01:19:55.104 --> 01:19:56.403
You hear that, Trevor?

01:19:56.405 --> 01:19:58.004
We're going on a trip.

01:19:59.942 --> 01:20:00.974
-[thudding downstairs]
-What was that?

01:20:07.283 --> 01:20:09.650
[♪♪♪]

01:20:10.819 --> 01:20:12.419
[door opens]

01:20:15.124 --> 01:20:16.657
Martin!

01:20:16.659 --> 01:20:18.425
[louder]: Martin!

01:20:18.427 --> 01:20:20.060
He's all right.

01:20:20.062 --> 01:20:22.329
We were on our way over here
when we heard your 911 call.

01:20:22.331 --> 01:20:23.530
There's an ambulance
is on the way.

01:20:23.532 --> 01:20:24.998
-Granberrys.
-Yeah. We know. We're just--

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:25.832
waiting for local police to get
here with a search warrant.

01:20:25.834 --> 01:20:28.535
Aurora went over there.

01:20:30.706 --> 01:20:32.139
Where's your friend?

01:20:32.141 --> 01:20:34.642
She got out.

01:20:34.644 --> 01:20:35.676
That's impossible.

01:20:36.779 --> 01:20:37.844
[crashing]

01:20:37.846 --> 01:20:38.979
Go!

01:20:38.981 --> 01:20:40.347
Go, go, go!

01:20:42.418 --> 01:20:44.117
-[grunting]
-Go!

01:20:44.119 --> 01:20:45.051
Go get Hayden!

01:20:55.097 --> 01:20:56.530
Give me my baby.

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.567
[both grunting]

01:21:07.677 --> 01:21:08.842

01:21:13.783 --> 01:21:14.748
[thud]

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:28.529
You need to give Hayden
back to his mother now.

01:21:30.165 --> 01:21:32.132
[♪♪♪]

01:21:38.173 --> 01:21:39.873
Where's Martin?
Did you find Martin?

01:21:39.875 --> 01:21:41.408
On Craig
and Regina's couch,

01:21:41.410 --> 01:21:43.043
and yes, he's
still breathing.

01:21:43.045 --> 01:21:44.345
The paramedics should
be there soon.

01:21:44.347 --> 01:21:45.412
Well, go!

01:21:45.414 --> 01:21:46.413
He needs you.

01:21:46.415 --> 01:21:47.514
Okay.

01:21:47.516 --> 01:21:49.115
On your lead?

01:21:49.117 --> 01:21:51.652
No. I'm just back-up.

01:21:57.326 --> 01:21:59.793

01:22:02.965 --> 01:22:04.898
[grunts]

01:22:07.069 --> 01:22:09.002
Did you hear
what they said in there?

01:22:09.004 --> 01:22:11.972
Your wound isn't severe.
You're gonna be okay.

01:22:11.974 --> 01:22:13.407
And Regina?

01:22:13.409 --> 01:22:15.308
She's over there.

01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:17.043
She's fine,
Hayden's fine.

01:22:17.045 --> 01:22:19.646
Lynn's gonna bring them
to the hospital to see you.

01:22:19.648 --> 01:22:21.582
What about the Granberrys?

01:22:21.584 --> 01:22:23.751
On their way
to Corinth jail.

01:22:23.753 --> 01:22:26.286
Thanks to you.

01:22:26.288 --> 01:22:27.521
Oh, my goodness!

01:22:27.523 --> 01:22:29.356
I'm so happy
you're both okay.

01:22:29.358 --> 01:22:30.524
Thank you, Sally.

01:22:30.526 --> 01:22:33.326
Hey, John.
Did you ask her?

01:22:33.328 --> 01:22:34.561
Not yet.

01:22:34.563 --> 01:22:36.864
I think I better wait
a while after all this.

01:22:36.866 --> 01:22:38.031
Get better.

01:22:39.201 --> 01:22:40.233
Let's go get
some quotes.

01:22:41.437 --> 01:22:43.136
What was that all about?

01:22:43.138 --> 01:22:47.240
Oh, just about the stubbornness
of the Teagarden women.

01:22:48.611 --> 01:22:51.011

01:22:58.587 --> 01:23:01.588

Aww, he's getting big.

It's great to see
Regina so happy.

01:23:05.961 --> 01:23:08.629
I'm glad she's getting
a second chance.

01:23:09.832 --> 01:23:11.965
She loves that baby.

I like the way
you're looking at me right now.

01:23:23.913 --> 01:23:25.913
Well, that's the way
a woman looks

01:23:25.915 --> 01:23:29.115
at the man she hopes will be
the father of her children.

01:23:30.419 --> 01:23:32.152
Does she, now?
