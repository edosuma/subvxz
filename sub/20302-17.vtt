00:01.001 --> 00:03.461
NARRATOR: <i>In the last episode</i>
<i>of</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:03.545 --> 00:04.921
(siren blaring)

00:05.005 --> 00:06.923
I begin to wonder if our desire to protect

00:07.007 --> 00:08.842
one of our own
hasn’t muddied our thinking.

00:08.925 --> 00:10.802
-Meaning what?
-Meaning maybe

00:10.885 --> 00:13.638
there was only one unarmed kid
in that alley that night.

00:13.722 --> 00:15.640
If Weeks gets away with the shooting,

00:15.724 --> 00:16.766
righteous or not,

00:16.850 --> 00:18.852
the entire community
will perceive cover-up.

00:18.935 --> 00:21.104
They will scream cover-up,

00:21.187 --> 00:23.857
and you’ll have a full-blown
riot on your hands.

00:23.940 --> 00:26.401
Why don’t you jump back
in your police car,

00:26.484 --> 00:29.070
-white lady, before something happens?
-Just a second, son.

00:29.154 --> 00:32.323
Don’t "just a second, son" me.
I ain’t your son.

00:32.407 --> 00:34.409
(yelling)

00:34.492 --> 00:35.410
Lock the doors.

00:35.493 --> 00:38.329
-Request additional backup here.
-(racket)

00:38.413 --> 00:40.707
-Don’t take my babies from me.
-I got no say about it.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.208
-You can do it.
-I can’t do it.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.419
I’ve never seen you so up.

00:44.502 --> 00:45.587
Well, it’s Otis.

00:45.670 --> 00:46.546
Otis?

00:48.214 --> 00:49.174
Redman?

00:50.425 --> 00:51.551
Your orthopedist?

00:52.052 --> 00:54.054
Well, he’s much more than my orthopedist.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.556
You’re a drunk, my friend.
You’re a screw-up.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.308
-Brakes, J.D., brakes!
-(siren wailing)

00:58.391 --> 00:59.392
-(siren fades)
-(crash)

00:59.476 --> 01:00.977
-(glass shatters)
-(tires screech)

01:03.563 --> 01:05.857
PHIL: Item 12, the, uh,

01:05.940 --> 01:09.402
US Weather Service’s
long-range forecast indicates

01:09.486 --> 01:11.529
a stagnating low-pressure system.

01:12.030 --> 01:16.201
This means that we can expect
continuing unseasonable warmth

01:16.284 --> 01:18.078
with predictable consequences

01:18.161 --> 01:20.205
(stumbling on stairs)

01:20.288 --> 01:22.874
violence-wise, drug-wise,
and hormone-wise.

01:22.957 --> 01:25.043
So let’s be particularly alert out there.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.963
Item 13, operation dust and clean,

01:29.047 --> 01:31.466
otherwise known as "D" and "C,"
will commence this a.m.

01:31.549 --> 01:33.051
(groaning)

01:33.134 --> 01:35.887
Lieutenant Hunter’s emergency action team,

01:35.970 --> 01:38.223
along with units from Von Steuben Avenue,

01:38.890 --> 01:42.685
St. James Park, and Northeast
will make a weapons sweep

01:42.769 --> 01:44.771
of the Jefferson Avenue playground.

01:44.854 --> 01:46.564
-(jeering)
-Not again.

01:46.648 --> 01:50.401
Yeah, again. Ours is not
to question why, cowboy, it’s just to--

01:50.485 --> 01:52.403
-Go down and don’t ask why.
-That's right.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.738
Female personnel.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.991
As you may recall
from last year at this time,

01:57.075 --> 01:59.994
the Women’s Police Officers
Association confronted division

02:00.078 --> 02:04.082
over the required wearing
of a supportive undergarment.

02:04.165 --> 02:06.334
(laughter)

02:06.417 --> 02:10.421
It was determined that for reasons
of safety, comfort, and administration,

02:10.505 --> 02:14.384
and in spite
of individual characteristics or tastes,

02:14.467 --> 02:17.095
said supportive undergarment stays on.

02:17.178 --> 02:19.430
(men groaning)

02:20.473 --> 02:23.893
We’re all sorry about that, ladies.

02:24.644 --> 02:28.189
The last item, as you’re all
no doubt well aware,

02:28.273 --> 02:31.901
we have been decimated
by the Asian-type flu bug.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.362
Night shift has been
particularly hard hit.

02:34.946 --> 02:37.615
So I’ve taken the liberty
of volunteering several of you

02:37.699 --> 02:39.159
for a double shift.

02:39.242 --> 02:42.287
Lyle, Hill, Renko.

02:44.747 --> 02:45.582
Uh-uh.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.751
All right, that’s it. Let’s roll.

02:49.210 --> 02:50.295
And, hey...

02:51.379 --> 02:53.339
let’s be careful out there.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.216
(all chattering)

02:57.260 --> 02:59.137
What does-- What does "maybe" mean?

02:59.220 --> 03:01.472
LUCY: It means maybe.

03:01.556 --> 03:02.682
I got school tonight.

03:02.765 --> 03:04.142
You mean you got Sandra tonight.

03:04.225 --> 03:06.019
-Same difference.
-Not the same difference.

03:06.102 --> 03:08.771
-Don’t argue. Same difference.
-It’s not the same difference.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.025
Hey, J.D.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.694
Don’t you eat dinner?

03:14.777 --> 03:17.155
Joe, my man, you have
the opportunity of a lifetime

03:17.238 --> 03:19.824
right in front of you,
you take my shift tonight.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.285
-Forget about it.
-Joe, I’m begging you on my knees here.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.662
-It’s my education, Joe.
-I have plans, too, Renko.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.039
We’ll take it.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.543
-What are you talking about?
-Lucy, my swan, you are a soul mate.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.796
You have a rare understanding
of the male hormonal imperative.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.173
Yeah, you can say that again.

03:35.256 --> 03:37.175
-What are friends for?
-Lucy, my--

03:37.258 --> 03:40.136
-Hey, hey, come on, man.
-Hey, J.D. J.D.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.556
-What happened to you last night, boy?
-Want to get it out of your system, Renko?

03:43.640 --> 03:45.725
My partner was just wondering
how you got that car

03:45.808 --> 03:48.311
situated in that showroom last night.
I said, "It’s simple.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.355
Drive through the front window,
turn left, and park."

03:50.438 --> 03:51.981
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Renko.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.025
-Yeah, yeah--
-Dog breath.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.487
What’s the matter?
You didn’t get any of my messages?

04:00.865 --> 04:02.408
Yeah...

04:02.492 --> 04:06.454
Excuse me. Come here.
I got a bulletin for you.

04:06.537 --> 04:09.165
That sweep, that sweep comes down today.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.834
That means warrants, arrests,
the whole <i>schmeer.</i>

04:11.918 --> 04:13.711
If you didn’t take care
of that problem of yours,

04:13.795 --> 04:16.047
if you were hoping it was
going to go away or something,

04:16.130 --> 04:17.548
you better take care of it now.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.509
Look, Mick. Mick, look.

04:19.592 --> 04:22.262
The broad’s a stewardess,
you know, fly now, pay later?

04:22.345 --> 04:24.597
I haven’t been able to get to her yet.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.641
Hey, come on,
can’t you help me out on this?

04:26.724 --> 04:28.977
-Pull the paper or something.
-No.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.729
You’re overdrawn at this bank, hair bag.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.274
Thanks, man. Yeah, right.
Thanks a hell of a lot.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.526
Remind me to give you a hand sometime
when you’re hurting.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.070
Oh, come on. There aren’t enough hands
in this whole department

04:39.153 --> 04:40.863
to help what’s hurting you, John.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.038
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch, we have a 9-11.</i>

04:49.122 --> 04:51.207
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

04:51.291 --> 04:54.961
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:55.044 --> 04:57.005
(theme music playing)

06:03.112 --> 06:04.489
(grunting)

06:04.572 --> 06:06.491
(shouting)

06:10.995 --> 06:13.331
-MAN: Look out! The cops.
-(tires screech)

06:13.414 --> 06:15.541
Nicely done.

06:17.126 --> 06:19.587
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

06:19.670 --> 06:23.591
you will face the fence, spread your legs,

06:24.842 --> 06:28.513
and grasp the fence firmly with each hand.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.934
-WOMAN: You can’t take my name.
<i>-Lo siento, senorita.</i>

06:33.017 --> 06:35.895
Bobby, I don’t understand
what we’re doing here.

06:35.978 --> 06:37.688
If we’re not making arrests,
what’s the point?

06:37.772 --> 06:39.315
The point is two-fold, cowboy.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.525
Two-fold.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.902
That’s right. Fold number one
is we were told to do it.

06:42.985 --> 06:44.862
Fold number two is
that we get these weapons

06:44.946 --> 06:46.322
and no one gets killed.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.158
Whoa. You got enough stuff here
to start your own South American--

06:49.242 --> 06:50.993
Hey, amazon lady. Where’s your warrant.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.412
-You got no--
-Hey!

06:53.663 --> 06:56.374
Respect. Okay?

06:56.457 --> 06:57.583
All right.

06:57.667 --> 06:58.835
All right, what?

06:59.794 --> 07:01.254
All right, officer ma’am.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.550
And what’s this?

07:05.633 --> 07:08.553
I’m into personal grooming.
You want a shave?

07:10.763 --> 07:12.849
(indistinct chatter)

07:18.896 --> 07:20.690
I know what you’re thinking, Bates.

07:22.358 --> 07:23.943
You’re thinking that I’m thinking

07:24.026 --> 07:27.447
that a patrol person
of your particular gender

07:27.530 --> 07:30.116
has no right being near this battlefield.

07:30.199 --> 07:31.659
Oh, no, that’s not true, sir.

07:31.742 --> 07:33.619
Bates, I’ve been keeping
a close eye on you,

07:33.703 --> 07:37.415
and I must admit you really
cut the cheese out there.

07:37.498 --> 07:38.416
Sir?

07:39.125 --> 07:40.877
That is to say that, uh,

07:40.960 --> 07:43.421
you know how to handle
yourself in the clinches.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.631
MAN: Lou, bring the squad
around to the corner.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.300
Thank you, Lieutenant.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.886
You can call me Howard.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.429
Howard.

07:51.512 --> 07:54.140
The fact is, though,
heretofore I have always felt

07:54.223 --> 07:56.684
more comfortable fraternizing with men.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.520
Lorraine has sensitized me.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.397
Lorraine?

08:01.481 --> 08:03.608
It’s a very special woman
I’ve come to know.

08:03.691 --> 08:07.528
She has really rotated
my sexual orientation, uh,

08:07.612 --> 08:09.780
if you acknowledge my drift.

08:10.781 --> 08:13.951
But what I wanted you to know is
that as far as I’m concerned,

08:14.994 --> 08:19.957
you are simply... a person, like me.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.880
Thank you, Howard. (chuckles nervously)

08:26.547 --> 08:28.508
Keep up the good work, Bates.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.887
JENNY: <i>You have no right to take it.</i>
<i>I came here last night, and it was gone.</i>

08:32.970 --> 08:36.265
Listen, I thought I’d been robbed.
I was suspecting my roommates, my friends.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.059
Get me back my jewelry, J.D., or I swear--

08:38.142 --> 08:40.311
I will. Hey, relax, will you?
It’s no big thing.

08:40.394 --> 08:43.064
No big thing?
A diamond necklace is no big thing?

08:43.147 --> 08:45.900
I needed the jewelry for this scam
I’ve been running with the Feds.

08:45.983 --> 08:48.361
If you were here,
I could’ve explained it to you.

08:48.444 --> 08:50.780
It’s kind of complicated,
but it goes like this.

08:51.239 --> 08:54.033
I had to hock the jewelry
for $1,900 in marked money.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.201
I got it right here.

08:55.284 --> 08:57.620
Then I was supposed to take
the money and make a dope buy.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.622
Then when the Feds dropped
the net on the dealers,

08:59.705 --> 09:01.582
the money’s retrieved,
you get your jewelry back.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.418
Oh, that is so lame, J.D.,
it won’t stand up on crutches.

09:07.213 --> 09:10.091
You stole my jewelry, plain and simple,
and I want it back

09:10.174 --> 09:12.093
or I’m going to go to the police.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.055
Okay, the truth, all right.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.020
I had an emergency.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.231
I needed the dough to bail myself out.

09:25.314 --> 09:26.774
I was going to replace the jewelry.

09:26.857 --> 09:28.401
Honest to God, I was.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.612
It turned hinkey on me. I got caught.

09:31.696 --> 09:35.199
I don’t know which one of us
is more pathetic, me or you.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.034
You didn’t think I was so pathetic

09:37.118 --> 09:39.161
the first night we spent in bed together.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.788
Oh, that was pathetic, too.

09:42.164 --> 09:44.125
You were so bombed,
you just don’t remember.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.251
(sighs)

09:48.045 --> 09:50.881
Oh, God, my life is such a mess, Jen.

09:52.049 --> 09:55.386
(exhales forcefully) Baby, baby,

09:55.469 --> 09:56.804
you got to go to my boss.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.765
You got to tell him
you loaned me that jewelry.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.684
Why the hell should I?

10:01.767 --> 10:03.436
Because I can take a heavy fall on this.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.313
Because my life can go down the drain.

10:05.396 --> 10:09.275
Jenny, please. Please. I’m begging.

10:12.653 --> 10:13.863
All right.

10:15.656 --> 10:18.367
Oh, boy. Really? Oh, baby.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.078
Baby, I’ll make it up to you.
I swear I will.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.332
I only want one thing in return, J.D.

10:24.415 --> 10:27.001
You name it, you got it.

10:27.752 --> 10:31.005
Turn around, open the door, walk through,
and don’t ever come back.

10:31.088 --> 10:32.381
-Jen--
-I mean it.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.550
Lose my phone number.
I don’t ever want to see you again.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.718
Get out.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.223
(exhales forcefully)

10:47.229 --> 10:48.147
Hello?

10:50.191 --> 10:51.025
Hello?

10:51.984 --> 10:54.195
Hey, what do you know? What do you say?

10:54.278 --> 10:56.155
Hey, what a terrific place
you got here, pal.

10:56.238 --> 10:59.617
Thanks. Yes, sir,
you got some smart merchandise here.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.619
-So, tell me, how are you doing?
-Good. Good.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.287
You got something there
you’d like to sell?

11:03.371 --> 11:05.790
Yes, sir, I sure do. You got a guy here,

11:05.873 --> 11:07.541
sort of a short guy with a mustache?

11:07.625 --> 11:08.834
Oh, you mean Shecky.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.252
That’s the guy, Shecky. Right.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.463
Yeah, well,
he’s kind of tied up right now,

11:12.546 --> 11:14.715
but I will be glad to help you.

11:14.799 --> 11:18.427
Yeah? No, no, thanks. No.
Oh, hey, no offense made.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.137
You could be the best in the business.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.806
My friends told me stick with Shecky.

11:21.889 --> 11:24.266
He’s a very good dealer,
a little rough around the edges,

11:24.350 --> 11:26.018
but you can trust him, you know?

11:26.102 --> 11:29.480
Yeah, well, he’s out to lunch,
so you’ll just have to deal with me.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.358
You see what happens
when you put your help on commission?

11:32.441 --> 11:33.609
You got to be Shecky, right?

11:33.693 --> 11:35.528
-You got it, pally.
-Hey, Shecky.

11:35.611 --> 11:38.447
So what are we gonna do,
stand around and <i>schmooze</i> all day?

11:38.531 --> 11:39.990
You gonna show me your wares? What?

11:40.074 --> 11:41.992
These are imported from Havana.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.370
They are hand-rolled Imperiales.

11:44.453 --> 11:46.914
Right from the boat to you
for three bucks apiece.

11:46.997 --> 11:48.541
In Miami, you get $5 for these--

11:48.624 --> 11:50.209
That’s if and when you can get them.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.460
We’ll take them.

11:52.586 --> 11:55.256
They’re from Cuba
and I’m Fidel Castro. Come on.

11:55.339 --> 11:56.632
You’re putting me on. Please.

11:56.716 --> 11:57.758
Uh-uh.

12:00.970 --> 12:01.887
They took me.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.808
(exhales) Uh. Oh.

12:05.891 --> 12:06.809
(grunts)

12:09.562 --> 12:10.688
Look, Shecky,

12:11.397 --> 12:14.066
I’m busted, man.
This is bottom line, you know?

12:14.859 --> 12:15.693
Broke.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.236
(exhales)

12:17.319 --> 12:19.822
I’ll give you the chair, man.
$200, take it.

12:19.905 --> 12:22.742
Please, don’t do that.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.285
I can’t take your chair.

12:24.368 --> 12:27.580
$175, man, that’s the bottom line.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.123
Look at this chair. It’s a beauty.

12:29.206 --> 12:31.917
It’s worth at least $600.
Have a heart, will you, Shecky?

12:32.001 --> 12:34.503
$175, it’s your chair.
It’s got everything, man.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.298
Look, it’s got reverse gears. Look.
See that go backwards? Look.

12:37.381 --> 12:40.342
Go forwards, two-two gears.
Goes to the right like this.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.303
Watch this go. Look at this thing corner.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.889
This corners like a dream.
Look at this thing corner.

12:44.972 --> 12:48.559
This is all chrome.
That’s not tin there, that’s chrome.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.144
Watch this thing go through here.

12:50.227 --> 12:51.353
-Look at this.
-(honks horn)

12:51.437 --> 12:53.606
Shecky, it’s got two rearview mirrors.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.400
It’s got a 16-inch wheelbase.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.319
It’s got low center of gravity.

12:58.402 --> 13:01.071
It’s got everything. Wait a second.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.573
Knock you out with this.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.912
Look at this.
Look at the undercarriage, Shecky.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.663
Look at that. Huh?

13:11.165 --> 13:12.792
Is that a beautiful thing?

13:13.584 --> 13:16.462
I drove that right out
of the Chippewa sickroom supply

13:16.545 --> 13:18.756
with $300 worth of suppositories.

13:18.839 --> 13:20.299
You don’t dare stop a cripple.

13:22.593 --> 13:24.011
You’re smart.

13:24.094 --> 13:26.722
I mean, you’re very smart.
You’re a regular genius.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.808
-Thank you.
-(Shecky laughing)

13:28.891 --> 13:29.892
Right out.

13:31.393 --> 13:36.148
Here you go, 175 smackolas.

13:36.232 --> 13:39.360
Thank you. Thank you.
Hey, can I tell you something?

13:39.443 --> 13:41.278
It’s a pleasure to do business with you.

13:41.362 --> 13:45.616
Thank you.
The feeling is mutual, dog breath.

13:49.912 --> 13:53.207
On the level, Captain,
she loaned me the jewelry.

13:53.290 --> 13:56.627
No lie. I’ll have her in here
the first thing tomorrow morning.

13:56.710 --> 13:58.754
She’ll verify it
with receipts, everything.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.798
Sorry, John. Francis, you’re running late.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.174
FRANK: Thanks, Phil.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.426
Maybe you’d like to come with me, J.D.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.012
I have to go back downtown
and explain to Chief Daniels

14:07.096 --> 14:09.139
how we managed to turn a routine stakeout

14:09.223 --> 14:11.767
into $30,000 in property damages

14:11.851 --> 14:13.602
and a near riot last night.

14:14.478 --> 14:16.856
Hey, you know, I’m really
sorry about the car, Captain,

14:16.939 --> 14:19.024
but it’s not my fault
that those brakes failed.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.026
"I’m sorry" and "It’s not my fault."

14:21.110 --> 14:23.362
Just one thing after another, La Rue,

14:23.445 --> 14:25.823
and somehow, it’s never your fault, is it?

14:25.906 --> 14:28.075
Did you make that phone call
I suggested last night?

14:29.201 --> 14:31.912
You need help, J.D.
You should have made that call.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.081
That’s funny. I-I meant to, you know,

14:34.164 --> 14:35.583
but with one thing and another--

14:35.666 --> 14:37.167
Don’t bother, LaRue.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.920
I just can’t have drunks working for me.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.757
Hey, come on, Captain.

14:43.841 --> 14:46.427
I suggest you put through a transfer, J.D.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.346
I don’t want you around here anymore.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.144
(indistinct chattering)

14:56.729 --> 15:00.149
LARUE:
Hey! You think I need this crap, Furillo?

15:00.900 --> 15:03.527
$490 a week

15:03.611 --> 15:05.988
to cozy up to the slime of this city

15:06.071 --> 15:07.364
for 10 hours a day.

15:07.448 --> 15:08.782
You think I need that?

15:08.866 --> 15:09.950
(gasps)

15:10.034 --> 15:11.827
Let me tell you something, man.

15:12.369 --> 15:15.915
I put my butt on the line
for 12 years for this department.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.042
I got three citations.

15:18.125 --> 15:21.837
I got a higher arrest tally
than any clown in this room,

15:21.921 --> 15:25.299
and if I got-
if I got a few personal problems,

15:25.382 --> 15:30.596
it’s this lousy, stinking,
rotten job that gave them to me.

15:30.679 --> 15:34.099
(panting)

15:34.183 --> 15:37.311
S-Sit there, you lunch buckets.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.813
Go ahead! One of your own’s in trouble,

15:39.897 --> 15:42.316
and-- and you sit there
like-- like you’re watching

15:42.399 --> 15:44.109
some kind of a freak show or something.

15:45.694 --> 15:48.447
(bin clatters)

15:49.823 --> 15:51.575
(footfalls fading)

15:51.659 --> 15:53.661
(door slamming)

16:00.459 --> 16:01.961
Hey, no offense to you, Henry,

16:02.044 --> 16:04.004
but it will go a lot easier
if I do the talking, okay?

16:04.088 --> 16:06.131
Yeah, looks like we came at a bad time.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.633
Yeah, any time’s a bad time.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.946
Hey, look, you got it all wrong if you
think we came up here to trouble you.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.280
Just that there’s certain things

16:30.364 --> 16:32.408
about your brother’s death
we don’t quite understand.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.534
Like what?

16:34.410 --> 16:39.456
Why your man only used two slugs
instead of the routine six?

16:40.708 --> 16:43.711
We were wondering what, uh,
Curtis might have been doing

16:43.794 --> 16:45.504
in that alley
at three o’clock in the morning.

16:45.587 --> 16:48.882
Look, I just went through all that

16:48.966 --> 16:51.010
with that other salt-and-pepper team

16:51.093 --> 16:53.846
from internal affairs about an hour ago.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.849
So suppose you guys just
clear yourselves on out of here

16:56.932 --> 16:59.268
and go ask them what we talked about.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.895
We’d rather hear it from you, Mr. Gilford.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.231
You’re going to have to talk to us.

17:04.314 --> 17:06.275
Why don’t we just go inside
and get it over with?

17:06.358 --> 17:07.568
WOMAN: Montel...

17:09.695 --> 17:10.696
what is it?

17:10.779 --> 17:11.697
Nothing, Mama.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.198
Who’s out there?

17:13.282 --> 17:17.036
It’s nothing to worry about.
Go back in with the others.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.554
Hey, I can dig the honky, man,

17:36.930 --> 17:39.391
but how do you figure into this?

17:39.475 --> 17:42.061
Are you the front window company nigger?

17:42.144 --> 17:44.521
Is that how you make your living,

17:45.105 --> 17:49.234
jive-talking us brothers
into letting another white cop walk?

17:50.652 --> 17:52.196
I got a good mind

17:52.279 --> 17:54.656
to kick your pale butt right out of here.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.075
Let’s go, Neal.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.786
Our condolences to your family.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.245
Come on. Let’s go.

18:01.663 --> 18:02.498
Daddy...

18:04.583 --> 18:06.960
I buried my brother this morning,

18:07.544 --> 18:11.590
and your man Weeks, he gonna pay for that.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.218
See, this time,

18:14.301 --> 18:17.262
they shot down the wrong man.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.600
You see, everybody knew
how special Curtis were.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.478
He was even headed
for college in the fall.

18:25.896 --> 18:29.316
You tell your white bosses

18:30.317 --> 18:35.781
that open season on us is over, gray meat.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.283
For the sake of simplicity, Frank,

18:39.201 --> 18:41.411
let’s put aside all the peripheral issues

18:41.495 --> 18:44.164
raised here by the media,
the community action groups,

18:44.248 --> 18:45.457
to the lawyers.

18:46.458 --> 18:47.709
In case you haven’t heard,

18:47.793 --> 18:49.962
the owner of that building
your boys demolished

18:50.045 --> 18:52.756
is filing a $200,000 suit
against the city.

18:54.049 --> 18:56.552
But just for the moment,
let’s forget all that.

18:59.513 --> 19:02.683
You see, Frank, what I want to know,

19:02.766 --> 19:04.434
what the mayor’s office wants to know is

19:04.518 --> 19:07.271
what in hell you were doing
up there in the first place

19:07.354 --> 19:09.523
four days after a major riot,

19:09.606 --> 19:11.608
risking the peace of an entire community

19:11.692 --> 19:13.694
for a damned routine drug bust.

19:15.279 --> 19:18.740
Excuse me, sir, but that was far
from being just a routine bust.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.160
You’re telling me...

19:23.579 --> 19:26.665
11 units, 28 personnel,

19:26.748 --> 19:29.001
two tow trucks, four paramedics,

19:29.084 --> 19:30.586
and over 200 spectators--

19:31.628 --> 19:34.089
That’s a nice crowd
for 1:00 in the morning, Frank.

19:34.631 --> 19:37.509
And I suppose it was just
a happy coincidence

19:37.593 --> 19:39.344
that this all went down

19:39.428 --> 19:42.389
on the same damn block
where the Gilford kid was shot.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.933
We had a reason
for being there, a good one.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.769
That operator we busted
last night was the same one

19:47.853 --> 19:50.022
Weeks was staking out
the night of the shooting.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.232
No one gives a damn about that.

19:52.316 --> 19:55.736
All the public sees is a police blitzkrieg

19:55.819 --> 19:58.780
to scrounge up a last-minute alibi
for one of their own.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.743
You screwed up, Furillo.

20:02.826 --> 20:04.411
I told you to cool it up there.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.747
You deliberately went against my orders.

20:07.456 --> 20:11.084
It was the only way
we could prove Weeks’ credibility.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.379
At this point,
it may be the only defense he has.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.256
Forget Weeks.

20:18.967 --> 20:21.011
Even if I think he may be innocent?

20:21.720 --> 20:24.932
I said forget him.
He’s a write-off, Furillo.

20:26.850 --> 20:30.229
In less than four hours, the man is headed
straight from that coroner’s inquest

20:30.312 --> 20:32.022
to a Board of Rights hearing,

20:32.105 --> 20:34.608
after which I am personally and publicly

20:34.691 --> 20:36.944
going to hang him out to dry.

20:37.819 --> 20:38.820
And believe me,

20:38.904 --> 20:40.572
it couldn’t come at a better time.

20:41.865 --> 20:42.950
Understand?

20:44.952 --> 20:46.245
Oh, yes, sir.

20:50.582 --> 20:54.044
No, I want my babies back home today
or I’m getting me a lawyer.

20:54.127 --> 20:55.295
I don’t want to hear no more.

20:55.379 --> 20:58.131
You’re not here to tell us anything, girl.
You’re here to listen.

20:58.715 --> 21:01.385
The only reason
you’re not in jail this very moment

21:01.468 --> 21:02.803
for felony child endangerment

21:02.886 --> 21:05.430
is that Officer Hill had
a word with his captain

21:05.514 --> 21:07.057
on your behalf.

21:10.018 --> 21:12.020
You just get this
through your head, Shirret.

21:12.604 --> 21:14.439
Those children of yours
are going to remain

21:14.523 --> 21:18.026
right where they are
until they can be placed in a decent home.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.281
It’s a closed case, girl.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.784
You don’t have any say in it anymore.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.090
Why are you doing this to me?

21:42.134 --> 21:43.635
It ain’t right to take them.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.762
It just ain’t right.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.765
Listen to me, Shirret.

21:48.849 --> 21:51.018
(pulls chair)

21:51.101 --> 21:52.352
Listen to me.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.689
I know how you feel about us right now,

21:56.356 --> 21:59.609
and I know you think that we’ve done you
some terrible wrong.

22:01.153 --> 22:05.699
Well, it is not about you... or us.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.827
It is about April and Chris.

22:11.496 --> 22:12.914
For once, just for a minute,

22:12.998 --> 22:15.917
stop and think
about what is best for them.

22:17.919 --> 22:20.005
You can’t take care of them,

22:21.214 --> 22:24.092
not at this point in your life,
not the way they need.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.055
And even if you could get them back,

22:28.138 --> 22:30.849
you know in your heart
that things would be the same,

22:31.725 --> 22:34.061
that you would leave them
alone again one day.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.981
Not today or tomorrow...

22:39.733 --> 22:41.276
but definitely one day.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.740
And if on that day...

22:48.617 --> 22:51.745
something were to happen to those kids...

22:54.414 --> 22:56.291
how do you think you’d feel?

23:06.718 --> 23:08.553
Does this mean I can’t ever get them back?

23:08.637 --> 23:12.057
No, it doesn’t mean that. Of course not.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.852
But a lot of that depends on you.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.871
You just watch, both of you.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.583
I’m going to make things change
for me but good.

23:40.794 --> 23:43.130
I’m going to get me a nice job...

23:45.257 --> 23:48.135
a decent place to live,
somewhere out of the pit...

23:51.555 --> 23:53.140
maybe even a steady man...

23:56.935 --> 23:58.520
and I’m going to come back here and...

23:59.938 --> 24:01.606
take my babies home.

24:05.193 --> 24:06.695
I hope you do, Shirret.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.159
I really do.

24:13.243 --> 24:16.163
(sad music playing)

24:35.515 --> 24:37.476
(people chattering)

24:37.559 --> 24:39.227
You know, I’m not usually this cynical,

24:39.311 --> 24:42.647
but I guess after eight years
of just keeping the lid on,

24:42.731 --> 24:44.983
well, I wonder what I’m doing up here.

24:45.066 --> 24:47.736
Well, I know exactly
what I’m doing up here.

24:47.819 --> 24:50.655
At least, what I’m trying to do.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.951
It better be a hell of a lot more

24:55.035 --> 24:57.287
than just trying to keep
a lid on this place.

24:58.288 --> 25:01.500
You’re not exactly your average cop,
are you, Robert?

25:03.210 --> 25:04.961
How about dinner?

25:05.045 --> 25:07.547
And then you can find out for yourself.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.009
Oh, God.

25:11.092 --> 25:14.429
(laughing)

25:14.513 --> 25:16.765
Sounds just like a pickup artist line.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.601
(laughs)

25:22.270 --> 25:23.271
I’m sorry.

25:24.397 --> 25:27.275
But I would like to take you
out to dinner sometime,

25:27.359 --> 25:28.443
anytime.

25:32.614 --> 25:35.742
Please-- please don’t take this wrong,

25:36.826 --> 25:40.080
but I spend five days
a week with uniforms.

25:40.705 --> 25:42.707
This is not a tattoo.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.417
These blues come off at night.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.504
I bet they do.

25:58.306 --> 25:59.474
Robert...

26:03.103 --> 26:05.105
I don’t make it a habit
of giving my number out

26:05.188 --> 26:06.648
in public buildings...

26:09.484 --> 26:10.735
but here.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.662
I’ll call you for Friday night.

26:20.745 --> 26:24.291
Ooh, man, so now she’s your date,
sugar daddy.

26:24.374 --> 26:26.293
(shouting in Spanish)

26:26.376 --> 26:27.586
Move it. Come on.

26:28.169 --> 26:30.922
MAN: Hey, no lip from you, buddy.
Come on. All right.

26:34.217 --> 26:37.262
(clapping) Okay, ladies.
Ready, hup, two, three, four.

26:37.345 --> 26:40.682
Step, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

26:40.765 --> 26:43.435
Circle, three, four, five, six.

26:43.518 --> 26:45.520
Upstage, upstage, upstage.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.606
Three, four, hips, hips.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.733
Over the shoulder at the audience.

26:49.816 --> 26:52.277
Five, six, seven, eight. Good.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.613
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.448
Hips, hips.

26:56.531 --> 26:58.408
Five, six, seven, eight.

26:58.491 --> 27:00.869
Circle. Three, four, five, six.

27:00.952 --> 27:03.163
Upstage, upstage, upstage.

27:03.246 --> 27:05.582
Three, four. Hips, hips...

27:05.665 --> 27:07.125
BEE GEE: Hey.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.421
You’re the early one today.

27:11.504 --> 27:13.256
Say, Bee Gee, how’s the girl, huh?

27:13.882 --> 27:15.216
Oh, pretty okay.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.636
Nothing a few hours’ sleep wouldn’t cure.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.348
What is this, your day off?

27:21.431 --> 27:23.642
Ha. Yeah, you could say that.

27:23.725 --> 27:26.394
PERRY:
...four, five, six, seven, eight. Turn.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.771
Turn. Five--

27:27.854 --> 27:31.650
Well, if I had a day off like this,
I’d be up on the roof catching some rays.

27:31.733 --> 27:34.903
I mean, look at me. I’m white as a sheet.

27:35.820 --> 27:38.865
Had such a great tan last summer.
Remember?

27:38.948 --> 27:43.328
PERRY: Hips, hips.
Five, six, seven, eight. Hips.

27:43.411 --> 27:45.372
Step. Step, step, step, step.

27:45.455 --> 27:46.956
-Come on, sell it, girls.
-(sighs)

27:47.040 --> 27:48.833
So, what’s your pleasure?

27:48.917 --> 27:52.420
Uh, scotch rocks.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.339
-Coming up.
-Hold it, Bee Gee.

27:54.422 --> 27:56.174
-What?
-Tell him.

27:56.257 --> 27:57.342
Perry...

27:57.425 --> 27:58.551
Tell him.

28:02.138 --> 28:04.015
What?

28:04.099 --> 28:05.809
Tell me what?

28:05.892 --> 28:08.561
Perry wants to know

28:08.645 --> 28:12.023
if you’re paying this with cash or what.

28:13.316 --> 28:16.111
He says no more on the tab.
You’re way over the limit.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.239
-I’m sorry.
-It’s okay.

28:19.739 --> 28:21.491
That’s gratitude for you, though.

28:22.117 --> 28:25.036
I brought that little creep
over a hundred customers.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.664
It’s all right. You tell him
I’ll pay the stinking tab.

28:28.373 --> 28:29.958
I’ll send him a check in the mail

28:30.041 --> 28:32.711
’cause I’m never walking
in this toilet again.

28:35.296 --> 28:36.673
-J.D., here.
-No, no, thanks.

28:36.756 --> 28:38.425
-It’s on me.
-No, that’s all right.

28:39.342 --> 28:40.260
John.

28:40.343 --> 28:42.762
PERRY: Come on. Let’s stop
standing around. Back to work.

28:44.180 --> 28:46.683
Please. It’s already poured.

28:49.269 --> 28:50.562
You’re a good kid, Bee Gee.

28:50.645 --> 28:54.065
PERRY: Right, right foot,
circle hips, into the circle.

28:56.234 --> 28:57.318
Hey!

29:00.697 --> 29:01.740
Hey.

29:05.493 --> 29:07.412
(exhales)

29:08.288 --> 29:09.998
Oh, Frank, thank God you’re here.

29:10.081 --> 29:12.333
I have to talk to you, Frank.
It’s really important.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.585
Is this going to take long?

29:13.668 --> 29:15.628
I don’t know how long
it’s going to take, Frank.

29:15.712 --> 29:16.963
It’ll take as long as it takes.

29:17.046 --> 29:18.631
All right. What’s the trouble?

29:18.715 --> 29:19.924
(exhales)

29:20.467 --> 29:21.384
It’s not Frank Jr.

29:21.468 --> 29:24.220
No, no, no, no. It’s not Frank Jr.

29:24.304 --> 29:26.097
I, however, am in big trouble.

29:26.181 --> 29:27.182
What kind of trouble?

29:27.265 --> 29:29.309
I received a phone call
at work this morning

29:29.392 --> 29:32.145
threatening my life if I go
to St. Louis with Otis.

29:32.228 --> 29:34.355
Oh, Fay, I’m so sorry.

29:34.939 --> 29:38.693
These kinds of phone calls
are just racist filth,

29:38.777 --> 29:40.737
and those cowards
never identify themselves.

29:40.820 --> 29:42.113
This coward did.

29:42.947 --> 29:45.533
Good. Then we can file a complaint.
Who was it?

29:45.617 --> 29:46.701
Mrs. Redman.

29:46.785 --> 29:47.786
Uh-oh.

29:47.869 --> 29:49.120
Her exact words were,

29:49.204 --> 29:51.331
"If you ever see my husband again,

29:51.414 --> 29:53.875
I’m going to cut your heart out
and feed it to you."

29:54.375 --> 29:56.336
Am I in any danger, Frank?

29:56.419 --> 29:58.880
Not if you don’t see her husband anymore.

30:04.761 --> 30:07.639
You are planning to terminate
the relationship, aren’t you, Fay?

30:11.100 --> 30:12.352
Fay?

30:12.435 --> 30:14.395
Imagine the gall of that guy.

30:15.271 --> 30:16.272
Ah...

30:18.066 --> 30:20.443
I should have known.
It was just too good to be true.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.529
Where does this leave you with Harvey?

30:22.612 --> 30:25.865
Oh, Harvey-- Harvey is boiled beef, Frank.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.242
I want escargot.

30:28.117 --> 30:30.620
You know, I had more fun
with Otis in one week

30:31.204 --> 30:33.540
than I had with Harvey
the whole last year.

30:34.123 --> 30:35.917
Well, then maybe it was
worth it after all.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.168
(exhales)

30:40.839 --> 30:42.257
I suppose you’re right.

30:43.091 --> 30:45.844
So you don’t think I need
police protection or anything like that?

30:45.927 --> 30:47.053
No, I don’t think so.

30:47.971 --> 30:50.056
Well, you’re the expert, Frank.

30:50.139 --> 30:51.307
But, I mean, let’s face it.

30:51.391 --> 30:53.560
You know I’m as liberal
as the next person, but...

30:54.727 --> 30:57.188
some of these women
have been known to carry razors.

30:59.440 --> 31:03.027
(indistinct chattering)

31:04.612 --> 31:06.614
Hey, come on. Wake up. That’s it.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.449
Hey, friend. Wake up, will you?

31:08.533 --> 31:10.118
No sleeping on the bar. That’s it.

31:10.201 --> 31:12.453
(rock music playing on stereo)

31:15.957 --> 31:18.293
Hey, pal. What’s it going to be, pal?

31:18.376 --> 31:23.423
J.D.: (coughs) Um, a shot and a beer.

31:24.632 --> 31:26.301
A shot and a beer. All right.

31:28.386 --> 31:30.972
Hey, uh, let’s see some money on the bar.

31:40.398 --> 31:42.233
Come on, pal. I ain’t got all day.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.404
That’s it. Look in all the pockets.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.619
All right, look, you either put some money
on the bar or get the hell out of here.

31:55.330 --> 31:56.998
Come on. Come on. Get out.

32:13.848 --> 32:18.061
-(horns honking)
-(traffic noises)

32:24.275 --> 32:26.486
Four days ago, my man,
out back in the alley,

32:26.569 --> 32:28.905
we had a chat about
that shooting that went down.

32:28.988 --> 32:31.741
I’m Detective Washington,
and this is Sergeant Goldblume.

32:31.824 --> 32:33.826
Oh, yeah, right, right.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.620
The retailers tax office tells us

32:35.703 --> 32:38.331
that this business is owned
by a Mr. Abraham Mevdez.

32:38.414 --> 32:39.749
-Is that right?
-Uh-huh.

32:39.832 --> 32:41.876
I take it you manage the store from here.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.503
That’s right. (sniffs)

32:43.586 --> 32:45.546
Abe runs the store downtown,

32:45.630 --> 32:48.341
and his son Bernie runs the one
out in Jefferson Heights.

32:48.424 --> 32:51.260
So, like, uh, I’m just one of the family.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.304
That shooting in the alley out back,

32:53.388 --> 32:55.556
the more we investigate,
the more it's looking like

32:55.640 --> 32:58.101
the victim and his pals
were leaving the back of this place.

32:58.184 --> 33:01.896
We’ve been through all that, brother.
Two times, once with you

33:01.980 --> 33:04.774
and once with those dudes
from, uh, Internal Affairs.

33:04.857 --> 33:07.151
Hey, hey, why don’t you talk
to the guy next door?

33:07.235 --> 33:08.569
He’s a strange dude, brother.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.780
If anything, they came out
of the back of his place.

33:10.863 --> 33:12.532
I don’t know, Mr. Monroe.

33:12.615 --> 33:14.534
We canvassed every merchant on this block.

33:14.617 --> 33:16.244
And the cop says it was your door.

33:16.953 --> 33:18.246
Then the man was wrong.

33:18.329 --> 33:19.497
(sniffs, coughs)

33:19.580 --> 33:21.332
This place was locked up tight.

33:21.416 --> 33:24.043
(sniffs) I got this hay fever
allergy problem, you know.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.670
First couple days of spring...

33:25.753 --> 33:28.798
Why don’t you tell your man there
to go get himself a cup of coffee?

33:28.881 --> 33:31.175
-What for?
-Because I think it’s a good idea.

33:31.259 --> 33:34.220
-(sighs) Ernie.
-Yeah?

33:34.303 --> 33:35.972
-Take a break.
-You’re the boss.

33:36.055 --> 33:38.141
All right, my man,
this is how the situation goes.

33:38.224 --> 33:39.559
It’s your word against the cops

33:39.642 --> 33:41.686
that the kids were leaving
the back door of this place.

33:41.769 --> 33:43.021
I’ll believe the cop.

33:43.104 --> 33:45.189
Uh-uh, man. No way.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.026
What are you doing?

33:48.109 --> 33:50.695
Turn around. Assume the position. Now!

33:51.446 --> 33:52.947
-HENRY: Aw--
-(exhales)

33:58.369 --> 34:01.372
Oh, you got a real expensive
hay fever allergy here, Monroe.

34:01.456 --> 34:03.291
We got enough toot here
to call you a dealer.

34:03.374 --> 34:05.293
Man, that’s nothing.
That’s just for myself.

34:05.376 --> 34:06.502
Turn around, sucker.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.465
This the reason those kids were here
at three o’clock in the morning,

34:10.548 --> 34:13.634
-to get their nose packed?
-Oh, come on, man. No way. No way.

34:13.718 --> 34:15.803
Henry, tell the man about the Delaney Act.

34:17.138 --> 34:20.308
One-year mandatory incarceration
for possession of that much cocaine.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.642
So you got one choice, my man.

34:21.726 --> 34:25.229
You talk to us or we stick it to you.
You dig?

34:25.313 --> 34:26.189
Oh, man--

34:26.272 --> 34:27.482
Neal.

34:28.107 --> 34:31.486
Okay, look, there’s these boys.
They work the garment district,

34:31.569 --> 34:34.739
ripping off what they can from the racks.
The menswear they bring up here,

34:34.822 --> 34:37.784
I-I work it in with the regular
merchandise for cash.

34:37.867 --> 34:39.577
-Does the owner know about this?
-No, no,

34:39.660 --> 34:41.579
Abe’s got a bad heart.
I don’t want him to know.

34:41.662 --> 34:45.625
Look, look, look, look, you either buy
what they got or they take you down hard.

34:45.708 --> 34:48.377
I mean, they’ll cut you for fun.
They don’t care. They’re crazy.

34:48.461 --> 34:50.463
Yeah, me too, sucker.

34:50.546 --> 34:51.714
(pants)

34:58.262 --> 35:00.598
-All right, ain’t no need to shove, man.
-Right.

35:01.641 --> 35:03.059
NEAL: Which one’s Roland Dewitt?

35:03.142 --> 35:04.393
This one here.

35:04.477 --> 35:05.728
This your car here, Roland?

35:06.729 --> 35:07.688
Any car keys?

35:07.772 --> 35:08.940
Yeah, right here.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.655
Oh, man. (chuckles)

35:16.155 --> 35:18.741
That’s quite a little business
you got going on here, Roland.

35:19.867 --> 35:23.246
Yeah, yeah.
Better call in for an impound truck.

35:23.329 --> 35:25.039
OFFICER: You got it.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.791
Hey, what have we got here, Roland?

35:27.834 --> 35:30.628
-New license plate?
-This is unit 026...

35:30.711 --> 35:32.255
Yeah, let’s see here.

35:32.338 --> 35:35.174
OFFICER: Impound truck. I’m at 427...

35:35.258 --> 35:36.092
Uh-huh.

35:40.638 --> 35:44.767
(chuckles) Bingo. Yeah.

35:44.851 --> 35:47.937
Bullet hole real good, Roland.
Just like Weeks said.

35:48.020 --> 35:51.983
(chattering)

35:52.066 --> 35:54.402
Uh, they ruled it was
a justifiable shooting.

35:54.485 --> 35:56.737
WOMAN: Captain Furillo? Captain Furillo?

35:56.821 --> 35:59.198
(indistinct chatter)

35:59.282 --> 36:01.159
MAN: Chief Daniels?

36:01.242 --> 36:02.618
Well, Frank, you did it.

36:02.702 --> 36:04.620
White men exonerating white men.

36:04.704 --> 36:06.539
From the ghetto, it all looks the same.

36:06.622 --> 36:09.542
Everything in that inquest
is part of the public record.

36:09.625 --> 36:11.002
It sure as hell isn’t a secret.

36:11.085 --> 36:13.087
You can bet it will be
on the five o’clock news.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.964
You just won’t get it, will you, Frank?

36:15.548 --> 36:17.633
A white cop killed a black kid,

36:17.717 --> 36:19.468
and all the people on the Hill
are gonna see

36:19.552 --> 36:22.638
is that white cop walking away the way
white cops have always walked away.

36:22.722 --> 36:24.140
Gee, it’s that simple, huh?

36:24.223 --> 36:25.516
That simple.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.226
Maybe not so simple.

36:28.936 --> 36:30.771
Maybe you’re underestimating something.

36:33.316 --> 36:35.776
Maybe there’s more integrity
and intelligence on the Hill

36:35.860 --> 36:36.903
than you recall.

36:37.445 --> 36:38.779
I, for one, think so.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.239
Let’s hope so.

36:45.494 --> 36:48.497
(rumbling)

36:53.920 --> 36:57.089
Surprise, my hot little darling.
Andy Renko to the rescue.

36:57.173 --> 37:01.385
Okay, okay, I wasn’t expecting you, Andy.
I wish you had called.

37:01.469 --> 37:02.929
I did call. Nobody was there.

37:03.012 --> 37:06.265
So I thought what the heck, I’d come down.
You look real hot and real pretty.

37:06.349 --> 37:08.351
I’m gonna take this bag for you. Come on.

37:09.685 --> 37:11.938
So what’s the matter?
I say something wrong? What?

37:12.021 --> 37:14.065
Yeah, I don’t like being ambushed, okay.

37:14.148 --> 37:15.858
-It throws me off.
-I thought I'd call by.

37:15.942 --> 37:17.818
I’ll take these groceries
upstairs for you,

37:17.902 --> 37:19.320
then I’ll leave. I got homework--

37:19.403 --> 37:22.198
Andy, thank you.
I’ll take it from here, okay?

37:25.159 --> 37:26.494
I’ll call you.

37:32.792 --> 37:35.211
You got someone waiting
up there for you, don’t you?

37:39.924 --> 37:42.510
Why didn’t you just say that?
I can understand that.

37:43.886 --> 37:45.930
Actually, I can’t understand that, Sandy.

37:50.893 --> 37:52.144
Andy, uh...

37:53.479 --> 37:55.189
(sighs)

37:55.273 --> 37:57.483
I haven’t been very honest with you.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.654
You see, what happened is, uh,

38:02.363 --> 38:05.574
I’d been seeing somebody
for a long time, and...

38:07.159 --> 38:09.578
well, we’ve had our problems on and off.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.456
So you were just sort of
filling in with me, huh?

38:12.540 --> 38:13.708
No.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.501
I’d like to know
what it was we were doing.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.129
You said a lot of things to me.

38:21.632 --> 38:23.884
I can’t believe
you didn’t mean those things you said.

38:23.968 --> 38:26.762
Andy, you don’t understand. He needs me.

38:28.431 --> 38:29.932
He really needs me.

38:30.016 --> 38:31.267
What, I don’t?

38:32.393 --> 38:33.644
I don’t need you?

38:34.270 --> 38:35.229
No.

38:36.647 --> 38:38.065
Not like him.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.611
Now, that’s no answer at all.

38:42.695 --> 38:43.821
Sandy...

38:44.905 --> 38:48.284
this whole thing does not make any sense,
not after what we’ve been through.

38:48.367 --> 38:51.454
Now, you either love somebody
or you don’t...

38:52.830 --> 38:54.123
and you love me.

38:54.665 --> 38:56.292
And if you haven’t got the nerve to go up

38:56.375 --> 38:58.336
and say something to him, then I will.

38:58.919 --> 39:01.505
Andy, oh, damn it!
Will you just get out of here?

39:01.589 --> 39:03.966
-What? What?
-Please, just go.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.217
Is it my job?

39:05.301 --> 39:07.928
I know us cop types don’t exactly make it
in the academic world.

39:08.012 --> 39:10.556
What, is he some tweed coat-wearing
college professor

39:10.639 --> 39:13.642
who speaks seven languages, makes love
to you in French? Is that it, huh?

39:13.726 --> 39:15.227
-Is that it, huh?
-He’s a writer.

39:15.311 --> 39:16.854
Yeah, I bet he is!

39:20.149 --> 39:21.942
Well, let me tell you something, lady,

39:22.026 --> 39:24.153
I haven’t exactly been honest
with you, either.

39:24.862 --> 39:27.073
See, I score a lot
and I never get involved.

39:28.074 --> 39:30.409
Sort of like a hobby with me, you know?

39:30.493 --> 39:33.496
I do teachers, dental hygienists.

39:33.579 --> 39:36.123
Next on my list is a six-foot tall CPA.

39:38.417 --> 39:40.002
Six-foot tall!

39:44.590 --> 39:45.758
I need you.

39:49.261 --> 39:50.596
I do.

39:52.515 --> 39:53.974
(sad music playing)

40:04.902 --> 40:07.071
MAN: Folks... (tapping with gavel)

40:07.154 --> 40:09.573
Folks, can we bring the meeting to order?

40:09.657 --> 40:11.283
Joe. Come on, Joe. Come on.

40:12.993 --> 40:15.204
All right, this is
the Tuesday night meeting

40:16.163 --> 40:19.125
of the mid-town chapter
of Alcoholics Anonymous.

40:19.625 --> 40:21.877
My name is Ben, and I’m an alcoholic.

40:21.961 --> 40:24.004
Hi, Ben.

40:24.505 --> 40:26.257
I’ve identified myself as such.

40:26.340 --> 40:29.593
Now, are there
any other alcoholics in the room?

40:29.677 --> 40:31.387
(all chattering)

40:31.470 --> 40:33.431
Great, great. Looking good, looking good.

40:33.514 --> 40:36.934
Now, not to embarrass you,

40:37.017 --> 40:40.020
but to get to know you better
and say hello at the break,

40:40.104 --> 40:43.023
are there any newcomers here
in their first 30 days of sobriety?

40:43.107 --> 40:45.317
If so, would you raise your hand, please?

40:50.448 --> 40:51.991
Would you stand up for us, please?

40:58.080 --> 40:59.623
Can you tell us your first name?

41:01.625 --> 41:03.544
Uh, my name’s John.

41:06.547 --> 41:09.049
I-I guess I’m an alcoholic.

41:09.133 --> 41:11.010
Hi, John.

41:11.093 --> 41:12.595
MAN: How are you doing, J.D.?

41:14.013 --> 41:17.975
(emotional music playing)

41:28.986 --> 41:30.988
BEN: You’re most welcome
at this meeting, John.

41:31.071 --> 41:33.574
There’s a new life
for you here if you want it...

41:35.159 --> 41:36.785
and we all hope you do.

41:41.499 --> 41:42.750
There you go.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.043
Thank you. Thank you.

41:44.126 --> 41:46.212
No sweat. Just come back again, you hear?

41:49.507 --> 41:50.633
Dinner is served.

41:50.716 --> 41:52.510
Great. Hey, what do I owe you?

41:52.593 --> 41:54.011
On the cuff.

41:54.094 --> 41:56.180
Wait a minute.
Joe, you got to let me pay my own way.

41:56.263 --> 41:57.973
Hey, the guy wouldn’t take my money.

41:58.057 --> 42:00.643
He said we’d be doing him a favor
if we sat out here and ate.

42:02.895 --> 42:05.314
(grunts) I am starved.

42:13.030 --> 42:14.490
Will you stop it?

42:15.950 --> 42:17.034
I can’t help it.

42:17.785 --> 42:19.203
I love looking at you.

42:19.286 --> 42:22.540
It’s hot enough without you
adding to the steam.

42:23.165 --> 42:26.210
Yeah, well, it wasn’t me who chose this
over a ride to the shore.

42:28.170 --> 42:30.005
You missed a great opportunity, Luce.

42:31.173 --> 42:33.092
I know this great nude beach.

42:33.842 --> 42:34.885
Very secluded.

42:35.928 --> 42:37.096
Are you into that?

42:37.846 --> 42:39.056
Yeah, all the time.

42:39.682 --> 42:42.059
There’s a nude beach around here? Where?

42:42.560 --> 42:43.519
My bathtub.

42:45.020 --> 42:46.188
You're a character.

42:47.523 --> 42:49.733
Hey, look, it’s not too late
to change your mind.

42:49.817 --> 42:52.361
-Great.
-I’ll throw some sand around my bathroom,

42:52.444 --> 42:54.405
and then we can put on Beach Boys albums.

42:54.488 --> 42:55.489
(laughs)

42:55.573 --> 42:57.199
You’re not gonna give up, are you?

42:58.158 --> 42:59.618
I figure if I stay with it...

43:01.120 --> 43:02.746
I’ll wear you down by July,

43:02.830 --> 43:04.665
and you can move in by September.

43:08.043 --> 43:10.129
I don’t know what I’m going
to do with you, Joe.

43:11.213 --> 43:14.258
-I do. You’re gonna say yes.
-(horn blares)

43:14.341 --> 43:15.843
(brakes squeal)

43:15.926 --> 43:16.927
(yelling)

43:17.011 --> 43:19.847
WOMAN: Hey, you idiot!
Don’t you know how to drive?

43:21.098 --> 43:23.017
JOE: Oh, man, he’s going the wrong way.

43:24.059 --> 43:25.102
Go for it.

43:25.185 --> 43:27.187
(engine starts)

43:28.564 --> 43:30.399
(siren wailing)

43:30.482 --> 43:32.651
(people cheering)

43:34.612 --> 43:40.659
Dispatch, we’re in pursuit of vehicle
bearing license plate 100292. Over.

43:40.743 --> 43:42.620
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Repeat, please, unit 1-6.</i>

43:42.703 --> 43:44.288
<i>Our reception is breaking up.</i>

43:44.371 --> 43:47.333
(siren wailing)

43:48.917 --> 43:50.586
(siren fades)

44:00.596 --> 44:02.348
License and registration, please.

44:03.724 --> 44:04.975
(shot)

44:05.059 --> 44:07.394
(tires screech)

44:07.478 --> 44:08.896
Bargain?

44:08.979 --> 44:11.023
These two weeks
are going to cost a fortune.

44:12.775 --> 44:14.902
Furillo, don’t start.

44:17.571 --> 44:20.532
Well, I’m not used to going on the arm,

44:21.825 --> 44:25.037
even if the arm is attached
to a beautiful shoulder.

44:27.706 --> 44:30.042
You’re having separation anxiety.

44:31.001 --> 44:32.753
Lots of your workaholic types,

44:32.836 --> 44:35.172
of which I consider you one,

44:35.255 --> 44:38.926
break out in hives at the very thought
of going on a vacation.

44:39.009 --> 44:40.344
Uh-oh. I’m that bad, huh?

44:40.427 --> 44:41.345
Uh-huh.

44:42.054 --> 44:44.723
Worse than I am, pizza man,
and I’m pretty bad.

44:45.766 --> 44:47.518
Could we just close this book now?

44:47.601 --> 44:49.603
No, no. Just-- just let me finish this.

44:51.063 --> 44:52.272
No, now.

44:54.525 --> 44:57.444
I have a sudden need
for your undivided attention.

45:00.114 --> 45:01.240
Uh-huh.

45:03.867 --> 45:06.995
(pager beeping)

45:07.079 --> 45:08.706
(both groan)

45:10.708 --> 45:12.876
So much for undivided attention.

45:14.545 --> 45:16.463
Don’t worry and don’t move.

45:17.464 --> 45:20.676
The urgency of the need lingers on.

45:20.759 --> 45:22.261
(Joyce chuckling)

45:22.344 --> 45:24.555
(indistinct police radio chatter)

45:30.561 --> 45:32.146
When does it stop, Francis?

45:33.856 --> 45:35.357
I wish I knew, Phil.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.111
Is he gonna make it?

45:39.194 --> 45:40.529
I don’t know.

45:40.612 --> 45:42.197
They rushed him to County Medical.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.324
Where’s Bates?

45:44.992 --> 45:46.076
She’s over there.

45:50.038 --> 45:52.040
(sirens blaring)

46:05.512 --> 46:07.139
He’s gonna die. I know he is.

46:09.516 --> 46:11.059
If I had said yes...

46:12.644 --> 46:14.146
it would have never happened.

46:15.898 --> 46:17.316
Said yes to what?

46:22.029 --> 46:23.697
Oh, I should have gone with him.

46:25.157 --> 46:27.409
(sad music playing)

46:29.828 --> 46:31.079
(sobbing)

47:19.670 --> 47:22.297
(theme music playing)
