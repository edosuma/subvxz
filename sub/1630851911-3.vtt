00:11.200 --> 00:14.600
BASED ON AN UNSOLVED CRIME

00:17.840 --> 00:19.400
Damn. That was good.

00:20.880 --> 00:24.600
We have three kronor in the pot,
but we need one more.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.440
-What about Stig?
-No.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.560
Right?

00:29.640 --> 00:30.760
Uncle Stig!

00:30.840 --> 00:33.000
Three kronor in the pot, you're in.

00:35.680 --> 00:38.320
-You know how to play bridge, right?
-Yes.

00:39.520 --> 00:40.880
-Right?
-Almost.

00:40.960 --> 00:42.200
Almost?

00:42.840 --> 00:46.960
It can't be known that there's someone
in our dorm who doesn't play bridge.

00:47.680 --> 00:50.040
Sit. We'll show you how to play.
Right, guys?

00:50.120 --> 00:52.600
-Yeah.
-First you shuffle the deck.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.560
Watch closely.

00:58.400 --> 00:59.240
Pay attention.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.520
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.760
How's it going, Stig?
You aren't cheating, are you?

01:23.840 --> 01:24.760
-No.
-No.

01:25.480 --> 01:29.400
I've been thinking about something.
You look a lot like…

01:30.160 --> 01:31.440
How can I put it?

01:31.520 --> 01:33.320
You look like-- Einar!

01:33.400 --> 01:36.600
You have a pool table.
What color is the 5-ball?

01:36.680 --> 01:40.120
-I seem to recall it's somewhat orange.
-Exactly!

01:40.200 --> 01:42.080
You look like a 5-ball, Stig!

01:42.880 --> 01:43.920
No…

01:44.480 --> 01:45.520
Right?

01:47.040 --> 01:48.240
You're so silly.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.200
-Are you offended?
-No.

01:51.280 --> 01:52.520
No.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.560
Why wasn't Engström at the reconstruction?

02:43.280 --> 02:47.280
Göran, what did Engström say
when you called him to the reconstruction?

02:47.800 --> 02:50.720
Well, this and that.

02:50.800 --> 02:55.160
First, I couldn't get ahold of him.
Then he didn't have time.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.880
It was just a damn mess.

02:58.920 --> 03:02.160
They're a few men short
down at the information hotline.

03:02.920 --> 03:03.760
Can you fill in?

03:07.880 --> 03:08.920
Who's that?

03:09.880 --> 03:10.720
Engström.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.480
-Are you still looking into that clown?
-Yes.

03:14.320 --> 03:18.400
As long as we can't place him
on Sveavägen, we have no choice.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.200
Don't lose focus, Arne.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.080
No time for that.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.080
Maybe.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.920
It's possible that Engström shot Palme.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.600
From what you told me,
it's incomprehensible

03:38.680 --> 03:41.600
that they prioritized another lead.

03:41.680 --> 03:45.240
If Engström and Stay-behind
are behind the murder,

03:45.320 --> 03:46.760
we need more.

03:46.840 --> 03:50.320
We're not going to be the mouthpiece
for yet another conspiracy theory.

03:50.960 --> 03:54.760
-We'll go to print if we have the truth.
-Print?

03:54.840 --> 03:57.920
-What do you mean?
-Then we'll go for it.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.680
We'll start with a long article in Filter.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.480
Then we'll publish
the book about Engström.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.760
-What book?
-The one you're going to write.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.680
This is how Engström got to Grand
without anyone noticing,

04:16.440 --> 04:17.800
through this back door.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.760
The alarm was going off
for almost 50 minutes.

04:22.560 --> 04:25.680
That gives him plenty of time
to walk there and back.

04:27.240 --> 04:31.480
So Engström goes to Grand to shoot Palme,
but changes his mind?

04:32.720 --> 04:34.000
That's my guess.

04:34.840 --> 04:36.800
But I don't know why he changes his mind.

04:38.120 --> 04:41.080
And when he gets back here,
what does he do then?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.960
He needs to catch the bus.

04:44.040 --> 04:48.800
He doesn't have time to leave the weapon,
so he goes to the main entrance,

04:49.320 --> 04:50.880
probably via the elevator.

04:52.800 --> 04:57.440
Then he went here and clocked out
two and a half minutes before the murder.

04:57.520 --> 04:58.920
Okay.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.840
We should talk about this in my office.

05:05.560 --> 05:08.640
After Engström comes back
through the back door…

05:09.760 --> 05:13.200
he walks out on Sveavägen
to catch the night bus.

05:13.280 --> 05:16.560
He doesn't get far
before he runs into the Palme couple.

05:16.640 --> 05:21.720
That only happens because Lisbeth Palme
wants to window-shop.

05:21.800 --> 05:26.040
That's why they cross Sveavägen
and end up by Engström.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.240
Otherwise, Palme would still be alive.

05:32.560 --> 05:37.040
Engström couldn't have anticipated this,
but he still has the weapon.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.600
He's just met the Palmes on Sveavägen,
so he changes direction and follows them.

05:45.680 --> 05:48.440
The sidewalk is almost empty.

05:48.520 --> 05:52.760
He only encounters
the witnesses Fauzzi and Anders Björkman.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.440
Engström soon catches up with Palme.

06:01.480 --> 06:03.200
Write a memo about Engström.

06:03.800 --> 06:08.040
Who here would want to read that?
Only you can finish this.

06:11.040 --> 06:14.840
Besides, there's a certain clock
that keeps ticking.

06:14.920 --> 06:16.400
You know that, right?

06:18.400 --> 06:20.520
Only you can get Engström convicted.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.000
You're forgetting Fors, Granström.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.480
Others are working on this.

06:28.080 --> 06:31.320
But you don't piss yourself
as soon as Holmér shows up.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.280
Can you hear the clock?

06:45.200 --> 06:51.760
THE PALME MURDER
HALF A MILLION KRONOR REWARD

06:51.840 --> 06:58.560
THE PALME MURDER
"WE USED REGULAR STICKY TAPE"

07:15.560 --> 07:18.000
The government wants
a status report today.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.200
You have to do it.

07:21.320 --> 07:26.800
A couple of days ago,
a Finnish drunk demanded to speak to you.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.760
-A Finnish drunk?
-He had a lead.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.200
Are we that desperate?

07:31.280 --> 07:35.200
Apparently, the Finn did time together
with a real tough bastard.

07:35.920 --> 07:39.200
One night,
they were watching TV and suddenly,

07:39.280 --> 07:41.000
Palme appeared on screen.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.320
According to the Finn, the guy said…

07:45.920 --> 07:48.280
"Olof Palme is going to die."

07:52.000 --> 07:55.560
I wanted to check who this guy was,

07:55.640 --> 07:58.200
who was so sure
that Palme was going to die.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.680
When did this conversation
about Palme take place?

08:08.760 --> 08:10.760
A few weeks before the murder.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.440
From now on, it's a race.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.520
Holmér is up to something.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.240
Up to what?

08:21.320 --> 08:25.480
Only Holmér and his inner circle knows,
and we're not a part of it.

08:26.960 --> 08:30.480
But they have something
that they call "the main lead."

08:31.320 --> 08:32.800
"The main lead"?

08:33.720 --> 08:36.440
-That tells us nothing.
-Which is the point.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.760
Holmér wants control.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.680
So, it's a race…

08:42.840 --> 08:45.800
between the main lead and the Skandia Man.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.760
-You wanted to speak to me.
-Yes. Hi, Gösta.

08:56.840 --> 08:57.880
Thanks for coming.

08:59.400 --> 09:02.360
-Do you recognize this guy?
-Yes, of course I do.

09:02.440 --> 09:05.120
-From where?
-Well, from TV, newspapers, and…

09:05.880 --> 09:07.320
Not from the crime scene?

09:07.400 --> 09:10.360
No, definitely not.
Engström wasn't there. No.

09:10.440 --> 09:12.440
Engström says he was there,

09:13.040 --> 09:15.600
and that he helped trying to resuscitate…

09:15.680 --> 09:17.360
I know what he's saying.

09:17.440 --> 09:20.600
-That he helped perform CPR, huh?
-Yeah.

09:20.680 --> 09:23.200
And got the description from Lisbeth.

09:23.840 --> 09:28.200
And tried to give a statement
to an officer who refused to listen.

09:28.280 --> 09:29.560
It's all lies.

09:32.040 --> 09:35.520
-Are you sure?
-He wasn't there. He's lying.

09:53.320 --> 09:56.080
The Danish Security Service has a contact.

09:56.720 --> 09:59.840
-The Finn was right.
-Yes, but the contact wants payment.

09:59.920 --> 10:02.280
I won't let money stand in my way.

10:02.360 --> 10:05.760
We'll call it
"preliminary investigation expenses."

10:05.840 --> 10:08.280
-How much?
-One hundred thousand…

10:08.360 --> 10:09.320
-Oh!
-…D-Mark.

10:10.680 --> 10:14.640
-But that's almost 400,000 kronor.
-It'll be worth it.

10:15.720 --> 10:16.760
I promise.

10:17.480 --> 10:20.280
Command center. I'm still here.

10:20.360 --> 10:23.360
I've already told them what I saw.

10:23.440 --> 10:27.440
Yes, I know, Yvonne.
But I'd like you to tell it again,

10:27.520 --> 10:28.560
for me as well.

10:29.800 --> 10:30.840
Yes, okay.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.480
It was late Friday night,

10:34.560 --> 10:38.040
and I was walking
along David Bagares gata with my friend.

10:38.120 --> 10:42.440
We were heading towards the stairs
that go down to Sveavägen.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.280
-Did you hear the shots?
-No…

10:46.080 --> 10:48.920
But I saw a man running down the street.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.960
He was running in our direction,
away from Sveavägen.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.280
-And your thoughts?
-That he was running away.

10:57.360 --> 11:00.160
He checked if he was being followed.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.760
Did you see his face?

11:02.360 --> 11:03.400
No…

11:04.480 --> 11:09.200
but he was wearing a dark coat
that was rustling in the breeze…

11:10.200 --> 11:13.400
so I guess it wasn't buttoned up,
dark pants…

11:13.480 --> 11:17.120
and low shoes that made him slip.

11:17.200 --> 11:21.240
And he was doing something with his hands.
He had a wrist bag

11:21.320 --> 11:23.840
that he was trying
to shove something into.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.720
Did you see what it was?

11:26.400 --> 11:27.680
No.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.800
You're sure it was a wrist bag?

11:31.720 --> 11:33.040
Yes.

11:33.120 --> 11:36.040
Me and Stefan Glantz
tried to save his life.

11:36.960 --> 11:40.240
I gave him CPR,
and Stefan tried mouth-to-mouth,

11:40.320 --> 11:43.440
but there was so much blood.

11:44.960 --> 11:48.720
I guess he was dead,
because nothing happened.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.400
And you're sure it was just you?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.800
I think so.
I don't remember seeing anyone else.

11:58.440 --> 12:01.720
You didn't see him at the scene?

12:03.920 --> 12:04.960
No.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.400
No.

12:08.400 --> 12:12.080
How do you know
that it was right after the murder?

12:13.080 --> 12:17.920
Shortly after we reached the stairs,
we met that witness there.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.840
-Jeppsson?
-Yes.

12:19.920 --> 12:23.400
He said that a man
had been shot on Sveavägen,

12:23.480 --> 12:28.280
and that the perpetrator just escaped
the same way we came.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.040
It must've been him I saw.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.200
He says that you helped each other.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.640
So, you're getting close?

12:43.920 --> 12:44.840
Maybe.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.040
My contact is prepared
to give you important information.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.640
You won't be disappointed.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.320
What have you got?

12:57.480 --> 13:00.840
One hundred thousand D-Mark
has been transferred to you.

13:08.160 --> 13:10.720
The names of those
who were at the meeting.

13:16.120 --> 13:17.560
Is this your main lead?

13:20.280 --> 13:24.000
-The Danish police have sources.
-How trustworthy is your source?

13:24.680 --> 13:28.360
The names on the list are good.
We know they had a meeting.

13:28.440 --> 13:29.760
About murdering Palme?

13:31.400 --> 13:34.960
-It sounds a bit vague.
-I'm just giving you the information.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.120
Was he shot with a Llama?

13:42.080 --> 13:44.640
-And the numbers are…?
-The serial number.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.720
Yes.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.000
A journalist wants to speak to you.

14:11.360 --> 14:14.320
-I'm not interested.
-No, I assumed as much.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.480
I'll just put the number here.

14:36.080 --> 14:39.880
None of the main witnesses
saw Engström at the murder scene.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.000
Not Glantz, not Jeppsson, not Hage.

14:44.240 --> 14:47.600
Have you asked Lisbeth Palme
if she recognizes Engström?

14:48.280 --> 14:50.080
You know she was hysterical.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.640
Should I have asked permission?

14:57.400 --> 14:59.520
You ran things the first few hours.

15:02.520 --> 15:03.560
Then I took over.

15:09.240 --> 15:12.440
I think we'll have to arrest Engström.

15:13.040 --> 15:17.280
-Or we can't continue investigating him.
-It wasn't exactly a normal Saturday.

15:17.360 --> 15:21.200
The country's Prime Minister
executed in the street.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.640
I should've asked for permission.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.240
I realize that now.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.360
Or at least apologized.

15:33.760 --> 15:34.800
Friends?

15:40.000 --> 15:42.040
I had bought opera tickets…

15:44.200 --> 15:45.680
Come in. We're done here.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.400
-Hi.
-Hi.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.480
Hi.

16:21.280 --> 16:25.040
"MURDER SOON SOLVED"
THE BEST POLICE INVESTIGATOR IS CERTAIN

16:51.360 --> 16:52.560
What…?

16:52.640 --> 16:54.720
What-- What are you doing up?

17:04.920 --> 17:05.960
Yes…

17:07.600 --> 17:08.800
Yes…

17:28.840 --> 17:29.880
Try to sleep.

18:07.200 --> 18:11.080
Guys, he's on his way here!
Shut up, everybody! He's coming.

18:24.360 --> 18:25.560
Arne!

18:25.640 --> 18:28.640
FINALLY, ARNE!

18:28.720 --> 18:30.520
Arne!

18:30.600 --> 18:32.840
Ladies and gents, Arne Irvell!

18:46.840 --> 18:48.640
The best ones always leave.

18:50.400 --> 18:51.400
But you, Arne…

18:52.440 --> 18:55.400
You are among the best of the best.

18:57.760 --> 18:59.160
We find ourselves…

19:00.080 --> 19:05.240
in the middle of the biggest
murder investigation in Swedish history.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.560
It's also the most
difficult and dangerous.

19:09.320 --> 19:12.280
So, naturally, the question is…

19:15.200 --> 19:17.240
How will we manage without Arne?

19:18.200 --> 19:21.760
Who will provide your wisdom?

19:21.840 --> 19:22.880
Your calmness?

19:24.800 --> 19:25.840
Who?

19:28.800 --> 19:32.000
Today is your last day
as a police officer.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.960
Tomorrow, you'll be one of the "others."

19:38.360 --> 19:43.400
The ones out there who have no idea
what happens inside these walls.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.040
But we…

19:47.200 --> 19:49.960
we who remain,
we know what Arne is made of.

19:51.240 --> 19:52.240
Because you…

19:53.480 --> 19:56.560
are among the best of the best.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.400
And when we have…

20:01.520 --> 20:04.280
Olof Palme's murderer…

20:05.280 --> 20:07.600
behind bars, because we will get him…

20:10.120 --> 20:13.440
then you should enjoy
the luxury of thinking…

20:16.160 --> 20:19.080
"I knew all along that it was…

20:21.600 --> 20:22.440
them."

20:25.440 --> 20:29.680
Put your hands together for Arne
who retires today.

20:30.280 --> 20:31.880
Bravo!

20:48.040 --> 20:49.120
Is it time?

20:49.880 --> 20:52.880
POLICE

21:03.280 --> 21:04.320
Congratulations.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.440
Sveavägen, over.

21:42.520 --> 21:44.240
Tunnelgatan/Sveavägen.

21:44.320 --> 21:45.160
Yes.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.760
A guy's been shot.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.240
Has there been a shooting or…?

21:51.320 --> 21:54.800
-Yes, they've shot some poor guy here.
-Really?

21:54.880 --> 21:56.800
On Tunnelgatan/Sveavägen.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.120
Okay.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.440
It just happened.

21:59.520 --> 22:02.560
-Apparently, he was shot in the chest.
-The chest?

22:02.640 --> 22:03.640
-Yeah.
-Yes.

22:05.600 --> 22:08.480
-Is it really Olof Palme?
-Yes.

22:09.120 --> 22:09.960
Yes.

22:12.080 --> 22:15.200
So 20 minutes after the murder,
Engström wanted to get back in?

22:15.280 --> 22:18.480
Yes, and he was completely different.

22:18.560 --> 22:19.480
Shocked.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.760
Yes, he was extremely worked up.

22:22.840 --> 22:26.120
He'd seen Palme get shot, but still…

22:27.600 --> 22:30.000
-And then that thing he said…
-What?

22:30.840 --> 22:31.880
What did he say?

22:33.360 --> 22:35.160
So he thought Palme looked small?

22:35.240 --> 22:39.600
After the second shot, he stood there
and saw the body lying on the ground.

22:40.280 --> 22:42.200
He thought Palme seemed small.

22:43.240 --> 22:45.400
Why did he return to Skandia?

22:46.080 --> 22:48.360
It must've been his only option.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.360
-Have you read the draft?
-Yes.

22:52.600 --> 22:56.760
But you're way too eager.
Just stick to what we know.

22:56.840 --> 23:00.920
Like the weapon, for example.
We have no idea where he got it.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.880
-He bought it at Plattan.
-That's pure speculation.

23:05.640 --> 23:07.760
And it probably isn't true.

23:09.320 --> 23:12.920
-So he happened to have it at the office?
-I don't know.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.520
That's the point.

23:15.320 --> 23:21.800
Don't give Holmér a reason to dismiss this
because of some damn wild guesses.

23:22.520 --> 23:24.200
Stick to what you know.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.160
We're close to a raid.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.440
You'll have to rearrange a bit, huh?

23:51.960 --> 23:55.080
How many chubby
50-year-old compulsive liars

23:55.160 --> 23:57.720
have you arrested for premeditated murder?

23:58.520 --> 24:00.840
There's a first time for everything.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.440
Can you imagine Engström as the murderer?

24:06.160 --> 24:08.920
-Given what we know from the scene--
-No, not that.

24:09.760 --> 24:12.480
Given what we know about him as a person,

24:12.560 --> 24:14.960
can you imagine him shooting Palme?

24:15.720 --> 24:16.680
Yes.

24:19.520 --> 24:20.560
And you?

24:21.480 --> 24:25.320
Well, it can be difficult
to understand what Engström was thinking--

24:25.400 --> 24:28.080
Difficult or impossible?

24:28.800 --> 24:32.600
If we arrest Engström,
we can get a better picture of his mind.

24:32.680 --> 24:33.720
Impossible.

24:46.520 --> 24:47.400
Cheers, boys.

24:47.480 --> 24:48.440
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.920
Okay, tell me. Any news?

24:59.280 --> 25:00.960
It's business as usual.

25:01.640 --> 25:05.200
Every time I turn on the news, I think,
"Here it comes."

25:06.720 --> 25:10.240
"Fifty-two-year-old man from Täby
arrested for the Palme murder."

25:13.320 --> 25:18.400
Come on, don't be stingy with the details.
When are you going to bring Engström in?

25:22.360 --> 25:23.480
Well?

25:27.520 --> 25:29.000
Engström has gone cold.

25:31.800 --> 25:34.400
What he did on Sveavägen,
we may never find out.

25:34.480 --> 25:36.640
That in itself is a damn shame.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.800
-But he's not a priority--
-How the hell can he go cold?

25:42.400 --> 25:45.520
Well, maybe we pushed the angle too hard.

25:45.600 --> 25:49.800
Nieminen sees a man on David Bagares gata
in a coat and with a wrist bag

25:49.880 --> 25:51.680
fleeing the murder scene,

25:51.760 --> 25:54.440
and you're telling me
that it's no longer Engström?

25:54.520 --> 25:55.360
Like he said…

25:56.760 --> 26:00.160
there are some things that
we may never find out regarding Engström,

26:00.840 --> 26:03.520
but solving the murder
is the important thing.

26:05.760 --> 26:06.840
You started again?

26:09.400 --> 26:11.400
So Holmér got you in the end.

26:12.080 --> 26:15.440
-Did you even put up a fight?
-Cut it out, Arne.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.040
Listen, Göran.

26:17.760 --> 26:21.520
I understand why Engström
wasn't a part of the reconstruction.

26:22.640 --> 26:23.760
How did you put it?

26:24.520 --> 26:27.120
That he was busy. Did you even call him?

26:28.640 --> 26:29.720
You didn't, right?

26:32.120 --> 26:35.520
Have you ever believed
that it was Engström?

26:38.640 --> 26:40.480
Enlighten an old fool like me.

26:40.560 --> 26:43.960
If Engström didn't shoot Palme,
who the hell did?

26:44.040 --> 26:45.080
It's coming.

26:45.960 --> 26:47.840
Just keep following the news.

26:53.120 --> 26:56.080
A large police raid
against the PKK last night.

26:56.160 --> 26:59.360
The murder of Olof Palme
might be close to a solution.

26:59.960 --> 27:05.040
Earlier today, around 20 people were
arrested in raids in and around Stockholm.

27:05.600 --> 27:08.240
These individuals
were suspected of complicity

27:08.320 --> 27:11.040
in the murder of Olof Palme
almost one year ago.

27:11.640 --> 27:15.560
The murderer was alleged
to be an assassin hired by the PKK.

27:15.640 --> 27:17.440
Maybe it's finally over.

27:17.520 --> 27:19.920
The police have taken interest in…

27:20.000 --> 27:20.960
Yes, maybe.

27:21.040 --> 27:25.800
…20 people suspected of complicity
in the murder of Olof Palme.

27:25.880 --> 27:28.000
-And this is the main lead?
-Yes.

27:28.080 --> 27:32.880
Like I said, our efforts today
were a part of our main lead.

27:32.960 --> 27:35.160
It started early this morning,

27:35.240 --> 27:41.160
when the officers who were to participate
gathered in headquarters on Kungsholmen…

27:41.240 --> 27:43.800
It was pretty bold of Hans Holmér.

27:43.880 --> 27:48.120
-He really went all-in with the PKK.
-He didn't have a choice.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.120
Without the PKK, he had nothing.

27:50.720 --> 27:53.560
But Holmér knew
that he would be questioned.

27:54.280 --> 27:57.840
That's why he had
to get rid of all alternative theories,

27:58.440 --> 27:59.960
above all the Skandia Man.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.920
How do you get rid
of a possible perpetrator?

28:03.000 --> 28:05.640
It turned out to be surprisingly easy.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.800
The question was who would do it.

28:11.200 --> 28:14.720
Holmér knew exactly
who should be given the assignment.

28:15.240 --> 28:16.600
Göran Fors.

28:19.480 --> 28:22.400
All evidence had to be invalidated.

28:23.680 --> 28:28.960
Göran Fors started by establishing
that Stig Engström had been at the scene,

28:29.040 --> 28:30.080
as a witness.

28:31.480 --> 28:36.560
One witness had approached a parked car
and said that he had seen the murder.

28:36.640 --> 28:39.560
This was a misunderstanding,
which Fors knew.

28:39.640 --> 28:43.160
They knew that it wasn't Engström
who approached the car.

28:43.840 --> 28:46.960
Despite that,
Göran Fors declared that was the case.

28:47.640 --> 28:52.480
But the main problem
was still David Bagares gata.

28:53.320 --> 28:55.400
Who was the man seen running there?

29:08.840 --> 29:10.600
I don't recognize the coat.

29:12.560 --> 29:15.800
The one I saw was thinner and unbuttoned.

29:15.880 --> 29:18.480
So the coat is not right.

29:21.280 --> 29:23.520
But of course the coat was wrong.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.960
Engström hadn't been photographed

29:26.040 --> 29:29.080
in the clothes that he wore
on the night of the murder.

29:30.840 --> 29:31.880
Anything else?

29:34.840 --> 29:37.000
No, otherwise, it looks right.

29:37.080 --> 29:40.160
The length of the coat,
the person's build,

29:40.240 --> 29:42.960
those shoes and the wrist bag.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.440
That's how I remember him.

29:55.680 --> 30:00.000
How tall would you say
that the man you saw running was?

30:00.640 --> 30:03.640
A bit above average. Maybe 1.85 meters.

30:09.520 --> 30:11.360
How tall do you think he is?

30:13.520 --> 30:15.760
Maybe 1.80.

30:15.840 --> 30:18.360
Stig was 1.82.

30:18.440 --> 30:21.920
Nieminen was off by two centimeters,

30:22.000 --> 30:23.840
which was enough for Fors.

30:31.240 --> 30:32.320
FOLLOW-UP: STIG ENGSTRÖM

30:32.400 --> 30:34.080
Do we have time for one more item?

30:34.600 --> 30:35.720
Stig Engström…

30:36.560 --> 30:39.400
-You've all read the memo.
-Yes.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.680
We'll probably never know
where on Sveavägen Stig Engström was,

30:45.760 --> 30:48.520
but we're ruling him out as…

30:49.760 --> 30:51.720
having been at the scene.

30:51.800 --> 30:52.880
-Good.
-Lunch.

30:57.920 --> 30:58.920
I'll take it.

31:09.160 --> 31:12.160
Coming from a cop, it makes you wonder.

31:12.720 --> 31:15.960
My view is that they are totally wrong
about the weapon.

31:16.040 --> 31:19.480
They say Smith & Wesson,
but they weren't there.

31:19.560 --> 31:21.560
I heard both shots,

31:21.640 --> 31:26.000
and the revolver didn't sound as if it had
a caliber as large as a .357 Magnum.

31:26.880 --> 31:31.240
I'm also thinking about the second shot,
the one aimed at Lisbeth.

31:31.960 --> 31:35.240
The murderer must've felt great anguish
in the moment before.

31:35.320 --> 31:40.240
I mean, shooting Lisbeth must have been
like shooting an innocent animal.

31:47.480 --> 31:49.120
ENGSTRÖM WAS DRESSED…

31:53.640 --> 31:57.280
HE EXPRESSED DOUBT…

32:03.800 --> 32:08.720
…THAT THE MURDER WEAPON WAS
A SMITH & WESSON.

32:25.960 --> 32:28.120
POLICE HEADQUARTERS
THE PALME GROUP

33:26.320 --> 33:29.440
REPORT REGARDING STIG ENGSTRÖM
THE PALME MURDER

33:29.520 --> 33:31.400
SINCERELY, SVEN ANÉR

33:46.560 --> 33:50.640
ENGSTRÖM WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY
AT THE MURDER SCENE, BUT NOT AS A WITNESS.

33:50.720 --> 33:54.360
ACCORDING TO THE POLICE (IRWELL),
ENGSTRÖM WASN'T PRESENT AT THE SCENE.

33:54.440 --> 33:59.120
It's strange that nothing happened
after Häggström sent his memo.

34:00.720 --> 34:04.840
So the CIA hire Stay-behind
to murder Olof Palme.

34:04.920 --> 34:05.880
Why?

34:06.600 --> 34:09.240
Palme was too friendly with the Russians.

34:10.320 --> 34:11.800
The Cold War was ongoing.

34:12.600 --> 34:14.720
The CIA saw Palme as a threat.

34:15.560 --> 34:18.640
So Stay-behind hires Stig Engström?

34:18.720 --> 34:21.320
That's why Palme was shot
outside of Skandia.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.880
STIG ENGSTRÖM
HEAD OF ADVERTISING, SKANDIA

34:25.960 --> 34:26.920
MONDAY, MARCH 3

34:27.000 --> 34:29.360
1. ENGSTRÖM CLOCKED IN AT 8:10 A.M…

34:29.440 --> 34:31.600
Skandia used to have vision.

34:32.960 --> 34:37.000
Not just Skandia, but all of Sweden.
There was a will.

34:37.080 --> 34:38.120
Nowadays…

34:41.960 --> 34:44.960
Nowadays, no one pays attention
to my work anymore.

34:46.320 --> 34:50.160
They're only interested in how long
it takes Mr. Engström to do his sketches.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.120
-Do you know what that's called?
-No.

34:55.080 --> 34:56.560
The beginning of the end.

34:59.560 --> 35:00.600
And nothing.

35:02.040 --> 35:04.080
As long as your guy stays away.

35:05.640 --> 35:06.680
Palme…

35:09.040 --> 35:10.640
That disgusting rat.

35:24.280 --> 35:26.080
Time to go back

35:26.960 --> 35:29.960
and try to please
the geniuses in marketing.

35:30.720 --> 35:34.000
Stig! It's really you.

35:34.920 --> 35:36.080
Anna!

35:36.160 --> 35:37.520
-Hi!
-Hi.

35:37.600 --> 35:40.040
This is Anna Eckerman.
Anders from accounting.

35:40.120 --> 35:41.360
-Hi, Anna.
-Pleasure.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.040
-Stig's ex-wife.
-Yeah.

35:43.120 --> 35:44.440
-See you.
-Yes.

35:45.920 --> 35:48.280
-Do you live around here?
-No.

35:48.360 --> 35:50.840
I work at-- at Skandia.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.360
I have a senior position at the company.

35:54.440 --> 35:57.240
I live in-- Thank you. In Täby.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.080
In a spacious house.

35:59.160 --> 36:01.280
-Nice.
-Yes, it's-- Thanks.

36:01.360 --> 36:04.280
Yes, it's…
Täby has a well-ordered existence.

36:04.880 --> 36:06.000
High society.

36:09.320 --> 36:10.800
This is my son Rickard.

36:10.880 --> 36:12.840
-Yes. Hello.
-Hi.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.560
-How old are you?
-I'm 15.

36:15.160 --> 36:16.800
-Right.
-Do you have any?

36:17.600 --> 36:18.480
No.

36:20.040 --> 36:22.320
No, it… it just never happened.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.640
Too much work and…

36:30.560 --> 36:31.480
We'd better get…

36:32.760 --> 36:34.440
-Nice to see you.
-Yeah.

36:34.520 --> 36:35.560
-See you.
-Yeah.

36:35.640 --> 36:36.480
-Bye.
-Bye.

36:58.280 --> 37:01.440
Now Palme's going to
let his son study at Harvard.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.080
-He's not paying tax on the perk.
-Scandalous.

37:04.160 --> 37:05.080
Ridiculous.

37:05.160 --> 37:09.240
If I ever run into Palme,
I'll give him a piece of my mind.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.720
I see Palme now and again. He--

37:11.800 --> 37:16.080
Start by asking him why he let
that Soviet sub escape from Hårsfjärden.

37:16.160 --> 37:17.560
We only had to sink it.

37:17.640 --> 37:19.760
We eat at the same place. They--

37:19.840 --> 37:24.440
Palme's failure in the East.
That's a threat to our entire nation.

37:24.520 --> 37:29.080
I bet that's what he wants.
To make Sweden a puppet state of the USSR.

37:29.160 --> 37:32.760
-If we're not already.
-Somebody should put a bullet in Palme.

37:43.040 --> 37:47.720
PALME MET REAGAN LAST NIGHT

37:53.960 --> 37:56.240
Stig, come here a minute.

37:56.760 --> 37:57.800
I'm busy.

37:59.200 --> 38:00.560
Stig, please.

38:13.040 --> 38:17.160
Happy birthday to you!

38:17.240 --> 38:22.840
Happy birthday to you!

38:22.920 --> 38:24.920
Happy birthday, dear Stig!

38:25.000 --> 38:30.000
Happy birthday to you!

38:30.080 --> 38:33.040
Four cheers for our loyal friend, Stig!

38:38.200 --> 38:40.520
Yes! My friends. My wonderful friends.

38:40.600 --> 38:43.600
-And now for the important part.
-Oh, wow.

38:43.680 --> 38:46.480
-From all of us to our 51-year-old.
-Yes.

38:46.560 --> 38:48.920
What's this? Shall we open it?

38:49.000 --> 38:50.520
-Yes.
-Huh?

38:53.600 --> 38:56.440
How about that? Wonderful!

38:59.840 --> 39:02.200
Can I offer you some employee funds?

39:04.440 --> 39:06.640
Wait! We have another gift for Stig.

39:06.720 --> 39:07.600
-Here you go.
-Really?

39:08.520 --> 39:10.560
-Happy birthday.
-What's this?

39:11.720 --> 39:13.000
No!

39:13.080 --> 39:14.240
Wow!

39:14.320 --> 39:17.960
Stig, here's an empty glass. Fill it up.

39:18.040 --> 39:20.000
Right now? Should I?

39:21.000 --> 39:22.320
We have to try it.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.800
-But, Dad…
-What is it now, Petronella?

39:25.400 --> 39:30.200
-You can't buy Stig a bunch of wine.
-Why not? He's like a child at Christmas.

39:30.920 --> 39:32.720
You know he drinks too much.

39:33.840 --> 39:35.520
Who cares? It's only Stig.

39:38.800 --> 39:40.880
-Thank you. Cheers.
-Happy birthday.

39:40.960 --> 39:44.040
Thank you. This was fantastic. Cheers.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.360
We're thirsty again.

39:46.400 --> 39:50.280
The decision last night
came after ten hours of drama.

39:50.360 --> 39:54.000
Holmér was forced to leave
the Palme investigation after 341 days.

39:54.080 --> 39:55.560
They could not agree how to carry on

39:55.640 --> 40:01.200
after the failed police crackdown
on the Kurdish organization PKK.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.080
Media around the world

40:04.160 --> 40:07.400
are describing the actions
of the police as a failure.

40:07.480 --> 40:10.440
This is a national disappointment.

40:10.520 --> 40:14.360
The Swedish people believed
that the police had found the killer.

40:14.440 --> 40:16.920
The search for the murderer continues.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.840
The first reward for a crucial tip-off
was promised a few days after the murder.

40:21.920 --> 40:25.920
Now it's increased again,
to 50 million kronor.

40:26.000 --> 40:31.240
Hans Ölvebro is 42 years old
and has been a police officer since 1966.

40:31.880 --> 40:34.320
He'll take over the difficult job

40:34.400 --> 40:37.360
of leading the search
for Olof Palme's murderer,

40:38.000 --> 40:41.160
two years after the crime was committed.

40:41.240 --> 40:46.840
Ölvebro does not share Holmér's opinion
that a group must be behind the murder.

40:46.920 --> 40:47.960
So…

40:48.880 --> 40:51.120
they're back to a single shooter.

40:51.200 --> 40:54.240
The amount of information is immense.

40:54.320 --> 40:58.160
Are you optimistic
that you'll be able to handle it?

40:58.240 --> 41:04.880
Yes, I believe the information that's been
gathered will help us find the murderer.

41:04.960 --> 41:07.760
Even though
the amount of data is massive,

41:07.840 --> 41:11.600
Ölvebro thinks that it's good
that the Palme investigation…

41:20.280 --> 41:22.640
-Hello, Stig.
-Hi.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.920
Well… okay.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.800
Long time no see.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.200
Yes, indeed.

41:33.920 --> 41:37.440
I was just visiting.
I've been keeping track of you.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Really?

41:40.080 --> 41:45.240
They bought out my contract at Skandia.
I spent too much time on the Palme murder.

41:47.160 --> 41:49.800
It's an interest you and I share.

41:52.080 --> 41:53.920
Yes. Yes, maybe.

41:54.000 --> 41:59.160
It must be incredibly stressful
to walk around with that secret.

42:00.280 --> 42:02.200
I can see it's taking its toll.

42:03.680 --> 42:04.920
How can you stand it?

42:09.480 --> 42:11.240
-I don't know what--
-I have a proposal.

42:14.080 --> 42:17.880
We both know
that you'll get caught sooner or later.

42:18.840 --> 42:21.800
I might be the one to catch you,
or someone else.

42:23.400 --> 42:24.920
Only death can save you.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.760
So how about we share the money?

42:37.720 --> 42:41.720
If you give me
enough information to nail you,

42:41.800 --> 42:44.040
you'll get 40 million.

42:44.120 --> 42:45.320
I'll settle for ten.

42:46.200 --> 42:47.920
You'll be out in 15 years.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.960
You'll be rich and famous.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.080
What do you say?

43:05.520 --> 43:08.160
-Well, I…
-I'm just joking, Stig.

43:09.640 --> 43:11.280
I'd never let you have a dime.

43:12.800 --> 43:16.160
But interesting that you considered it.

43:17.480 --> 43:18.520
See you.

43:31.760 --> 43:34.600
Based on the book The Unlikely Murderer
by Thomas Pettersson.

43:34.680 --> 43:37.360
It has not been proved
that Stig Engström murdered Olof Palme,

43:37.440 --> 43:39.840
but the Swedish police
and Prosecution Authority suspect him.
