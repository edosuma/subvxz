00:10.977 --> 00:13.079
So, what is the point
of skateboarding?

00:13.146 --> 00:14.514
With you there's
always got to be a point.

00:14.581 --> 00:16.649
It's skateboarding,
it's fun,
it just is.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.721
-Careful!
-(BOYS LAUGHING)

00:21.788 --> 00:23.757
So Clyde fights
Slitheens and Gorgons,

00:23.823 --> 00:26.326
and that's okay with you,
but a bit of skateboarding

00:26.393 --> 00:28.161
and whoa! (LAUGHS)

00:28.228 --> 00:30.196
I know! Oh, shame on me.

00:30.263 --> 00:32.832
Well, I've changed
since I've met you lot,
I've gone all mumsy.

00:32.899 --> 00:34.634
Yeah, change for the better
if you don't mind me saying.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.002
Do you remember that first day
we moved in?

00:36.069 --> 00:37.504
-Talk about frosty!
-(GASPS)

00:37.570 --> 00:38.471
I was not!

00:39.072 --> 00:41.241
Yes, you were!

00:41.307 --> 00:43.610
No, no, no, no.
You've got it all wrong.

00:43.676 --> 00:46.279
You've got to bend your legs.
If you wanna wallie,
really bend your legs.

00:46.346 --> 00:47.480
That's how you
get the biggest pop.

00:47.547 --> 00:48.982
Okay, and you would
know exactly what?

00:50.517 --> 00:52.118
Well, as it happens...

00:55.088 --> 00:57.190

Romford 1992.

00:57.257 --> 00:59.025

01:11.938 --> 01:13.673

Gotta get pictures of this.

01:17.977 --> 01:19.712
-Oh, no, I'll take them.
-No, that's all right.
You get in.

01:19.779 --> 01:22.182
-Loose tracks.
-ALL: Loose tracks.

01:22.248 --> 01:23.983

01:25.752 --> 01:27.720
Come on, Sarah Jane,
let's get one
of you on your own.

01:27.787 --> 01:29.856
Just a minute. Ready.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.157

01:32.459 --> 01:34.060
-(WIND WHOOSHING)
-What's up?

01:36.729 --> 01:38.932
Somebody just walked
over my grave.

01:41.568 --> 01:42.936
Come on, quick.

01:43.136 --> 01:44.871
Okay, ready, smile!

01:46.272 --> 01:47.273
That's it.

01:47.340 --> 01:48.608

-ALAN: Too old am I?
-(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

02:10.729 --> 02:12.232
So why did you give it up?

02:12.298 --> 02:13.933
Ah, you can't make
a living out
of a skateboard.

02:14.133 --> 02:15.835
Actually, Mum said.

02:15.902 --> 02:18.705
Yeah, well, now she's gone,
maybe I'll get
my board down...

02:18.771 --> 02:20.273
Please say you're joking.

02:20.340 --> 02:21.741
What? I'm good, why can't I?

02:21.808 --> 02:23.476
Well, even if you are good,
Mr Jackson,

02:23.543 --> 02:26.412
you're still too
old for a skateboard.
Sorry. See ya!

02:28.615 --> 02:30.149
Bend your knees.

02:30.216 --> 02:31.284
Come on,
let's get some tea on.

02:31.351 --> 02:32.752
I'll just be a minute.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.587
Luke borrowed a text book
and I need it back.

02:34.787 --> 02:36.923
I don't know,
what goes on over there?

02:36.990 --> 02:38.324
What do you mean?
Nothing.

02:38.391 --> 02:40.693
I reckon you're having
secret parties without me.

02:41.394 --> 02:42.128
Hurry up, then.

02:44.631 --> 02:46.799
Mr Smith, I need you.

02:46.866 --> 02:48.501
(HISSING)

02:54.707 --> 02:56.042
MR SMITH: <i>Hello, Sarah Jane.</i>

02:56.109 --> 02:59.078
Report the position
of Meteor K67, please.

02:59.145 --> 03:01.848
<i>Meteor K67,</i>

<i>V magnitude brightening</i>
<i>from 11 to 3.3</i>

<i>with a sky motion</i>
<i>of 11.3 degrees.</i>

03:11.424 --> 03:13.960
It's heading straight
for the Earth and
the authorities can't see it.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.029
Because it's coming right
through a radar blind spot.

03:16.095 --> 03:18.831
Of course,
why didn't I realise that?

03:18.898 --> 03:21.401
Well, if it hits us,
bang, end of the world.

03:21.467 --> 03:23.269
You're being a bit calm!

03:23.336 --> 03:24.871
Oh, there's no need to worry.

03:24.938 --> 03:28.007
When it's in range, Mr Smith
will create a magnetic pulse,

03:28.074 --> 03:30.310
and bounce
the meteor back out
into space.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.612
All in a day's work.

03:32.679 --> 03:35.381
You're gonna save the world,
and no one even
knows about it?

03:35.448 --> 03:37.784
No, I like it better that way.

03:37.850 --> 03:40.520
Mr Smith, how long do we have?

03:40.587 --> 03:44.524
<i>The meteor will be in range</i>
<i>of the magnetic pulse</i>
<i>at 2:45 p.m. tomorrow.</i>

03:44.591 --> 03:46.426
<i>All systems are prepared.</i>

03:46.492 --> 03:48.361
You see? No worries.

03:48.428 --> 03:50.663
I know, but you can't help
thinking if it wasn't
for Sarah Jane,

03:50.730 --> 03:53.032
we'd all be dead!

03:53.099 --> 03:55.201
Tell you what, Luke.
Go put the kettle on,
I'm parched.

03:55.268 --> 03:56.636
-Be down in a sec.
-Sure.

03:57.437 --> 03:58.738
See you later, Maria.

04:00.940 --> 04:02.675
(LOW) Just wanted
a word in private.

04:16.689 --> 04:18.992
This is for you.

04:20.026 --> 04:20.860
Wow!

04:23.429 --> 04:25.365
It's beautiful.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.633
Where'd you get it?

04:26.699 --> 04:28.101
Remember
that Verron soothsayer

04:28.167 --> 04:30.003
we helped fly home
the other week?

04:30.069 --> 04:31.871
It's from him.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.373
What's it for?

04:34.173 --> 04:36.142
I don't know.

04:36.209 --> 04:38.511
He said, "Remember."

04:38.578 --> 04:40.847
Just, "Remember".
Whatever that means.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.950
So why are you
giving it to me?

04:44.017 --> 04:47.053
He said, "Give it
to the person you
trust the most."

04:48.821 --> 04:50.990
And that's you.

04:51.057 --> 04:53.493
But it's probably best
not to tell Luke
that bit.

04:54.427 --> 04:56.229
(BOTH LAUGH)

04:56.295 --> 04:57.997
-MARIA: What's in it?
-Have a look.

05:02.268 --> 05:04.037
How do you open it?
It's impossible.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.243
-Which you knew.
-I tried.

05:10.309 --> 05:14.647
Mr Smith said
there's nothing in it.
Just a puzzle box

05:14.714 --> 05:16.616
and I forgot about it
till this afternoon.

05:18.117 --> 05:20.119
But there, it's yours.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.489
Thank you.

05:23.556 --> 05:25.558
Pop over tomorrow,
let me know how you get on.

11:42.568 --> 11:44.870
I can't help it
if I'm so popular.

11:44.937 --> 11:46.072
The birthday girl!

11:47.907 --> 11:48.874
Maria?

11:50.709 --> 11:53.012
Hang on, love,
where are you going?

11:53.079 --> 11:54.914
Hi, sorry.
Um, is Maria over here?

11:54.980 --> 11:56.382
It's just she was a bit upset
or something...

11:56.449 --> 11:58.451
-Yeah, she's just taken off
up there.
-What?

11:58.517 --> 11:59.985
Maria?

12:00.052 --> 12:02.755
-Do you know what's going on?
-Not a clue.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.826
(PANTING)

12:15.367 --> 12:16.836
Where is she?

12:16.902 --> 12:17.670
I don't know
who you're talking about,
love.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.105
Sarah Jane Smith!

12:20.673 --> 12:22.541
Never heard of her.

12:22.608 --> 12:24.443
Maria, come on.
I think you and me should
just go back to the house.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.412
But Sarah Jane lives here!

12:26.479 --> 12:28.781
In this house!
With her son Luke!

12:28.848 --> 12:29.849
Where are they?

12:32.151 --> 12:33.853
Mr Smith I need you!

12:37.156 --> 12:38.424
Mr Smith?

12:38.491 --> 12:39.859
Sweetheart...

12:41.594 --> 12:43.395
There is no Mr Smith.

12:43.462 --> 12:44.730
There's no Sarah Jane.

12:44.797 --> 12:46.599
No Smiths at all.

12:48.534 --> 12:52.471
-Dad...
-Right.
We're going home. Come on.

12:52.538 --> 12:53.939
Sorry about this.

12:55.674 --> 12:57.943
(FOOTSTEPS RECEDING)

12:59.612 --> 13:02.815
Sarah Jane Smith.

13:06.385 --> 13:08.354
Okay. So,

13:09.421 --> 13:11.023
yesterday evening,
what did we do?

13:11.090 --> 13:13.492
Right. Uh, I picked you
up from school,

13:13.559 --> 13:15.794
we walked home,
went to the park.

13:15.861 --> 13:17.029
We went with Andrea?

13:17.096 --> 13:18.430
Oh, no,
she was just passing by.

13:18.497 --> 13:20.799
We bumped into a lad
you know from school. Clyde.

13:20.866 --> 13:22.701
Who I don't know really know.

13:22.768 --> 13:24.470
Well, you said
you knew him vaguely,
he's in some of your classes.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.674
And you showed off
your skateboarding to him?

13:28.741 --> 13:30.442
And you were cringing, thanks.

13:30.509 --> 13:32.511
So when did I meet Andrea?

13:33.579 --> 13:34.747
Look...

13:37.383 --> 13:39.752
That's us outside,
the day we moved in.

13:39.818 --> 13:41.420
Andrea came over
and gave us a hand.

13:42.855 --> 13:44.790
But Sarah Jane was there,

13:44.857 --> 13:46.358
that's when we met her,

13:46.425 --> 13:48.928
and...
And she was all frosty.

13:49.128 --> 13:50.462
You've got to remember that.

13:50.529 --> 13:53.032
You said so. Frosty.

13:53.098 --> 13:56.569
No, just Andrea.
And she was lovely.

13:56.635 --> 13:58.704
Invited us over
straightaway.

13:58.771 --> 14:01.740
She's always having parties,
lives life to the full,
does Andrea.

14:03.108 --> 14:05.044
But I don't remember
any of that.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.679
Maybe you should
get some sleep.

14:06.745 --> 14:08.514
Nice little kip, then maybe
you'll feel better, yeah?

14:09.782 --> 14:11.717
You want me
to forget Sarah Jane?

14:11.784 --> 14:13.485
There is no Sarah Jane.

14:13.552 --> 14:15.621
I mean, come on,
this meteor thing
destroying the Earth,

14:15.688 --> 14:18.390
it's just a...
It's a bit silly,
isn't it?

14:19.425 --> 14:20.826
But... (SIGHS)

14:21.727 --> 14:24.196
I can see it all so clearly.

14:24.263 --> 14:25.864
Sarah Jane was so real to me.

14:27.066 --> 14:28.634
All the things we did,

14:28.701 --> 14:31.470
all the incredible things
we saw.

14:31.537 --> 14:35.741
Something happened last night,
and Sarah Jane vanished.

14:35.808 --> 14:38.611
Nobody remembers,
but I do.

14:38.677 --> 14:42.281
(STAMMERING) And somehow,
when everything
changed,

14:42.348 --> 14:43.716
I got protected.

14:45.584 --> 14:47.119
I'm telling you, Dad,
I'm right.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.655
(SIGHS)
And I'm gonna show you!

14:50.689 --> 14:53.559
"Sarah Jane Smith, solicitors.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.995
"Sarah Jane Smith,
Guernsey Women's Football..."

14:56.061 --> 14:57.563
Ugh.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.865
-There must be something.
-I don't think there will be.

15:02.501 --> 15:03.936
Hang on.

15:04.136 --> 15:07.539
<i>My Poems</i> by Carla Morgan
for Sarah Jane Smith.

15:07.606 --> 15:12.878
"For Sarah Jane Smith,
who left us
13th July 1964."

15:12.945 --> 15:15.714
The woman that wrote this,
she's the same age
as Sarah Jane.

15:15.781 --> 15:16.849
So?

15:16.915 --> 15:18.050
1964.

15:20.019 --> 15:22.454
Have they got newspapers in
the library, old newspapers?

15:22.521 --> 15:24.223
Should have, yeah.
(SNIFFLES)

15:24.290 --> 15:25.858
Come on, then,
off to the library!

15:35.334 --> 15:37.202
ALAN: Right, what have we got?

15:37.269 --> 15:40.372
MARIA: "Schoolgirl
Sarah Jane Smith, 13,

15:40.439 --> 15:43.042
"died after falling
from the edge
of Westport Pier yesterday

15:43.108 --> 15:44.543
"in a tragic accident."

15:44.610 --> 15:46.912
It's just the same name,
darling.

15:46.979 --> 15:49.815
"A second girl, Andrea Yates,
is being treated for shock."

15:50.215 --> 15:51.950
What?

15:52.017 --> 15:54.420
That's our Andrea,
from across the road,
she's Andrea Yates.

15:54.486 --> 15:55.487
You see?

15:55.688 --> 15:57.489
I'm not lying,
there's a connection!

15:57.556 --> 15:59.825
Did Andrea tell you
about this accident?

15:59.892 --> 16:01.126
Is that where
you know the name from?

16:01.193 --> 16:03.662
Why would I do that?
I'm telling the truth!

16:04.730 --> 16:05.864
SARAH JANE: <i>Maria!</i>

16:09.501 --> 16:12.271
Dad, did you see that?

16:12.338 --> 16:14.506
The names, they swapped over!

16:14.573 --> 16:17.543
-SARAH JANE:
<i>Maria! Help me, Maria!</i>
-(GASPS)

16:17.609 --> 16:20.045
And that's Sarah Jane's voice.

16:20.112 --> 16:21.747
It's her voice,
can you hear her?

16:21.814 --> 16:22.648
You can hear a voice?

16:22.715 --> 16:24.116
Dad, it was her!

16:24.183 --> 16:25.718
(SHUSHING)

16:26.652 --> 16:28.520
Maria, you need to calm down.

16:28.587 --> 16:29.822
But you've seen the evidence!

16:29.888 --> 16:30.956
There is no evidence.

16:31.023 --> 16:33.292
But I've worked it out.

16:33.359 --> 16:35.394
Andrea's done something,
and Sarah Jane's gone,

16:35.461 --> 16:37.930
just as that meteor
is about to smash into us.

16:38.130 --> 16:39.865
Sweetheart, that's enough.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.500
I think I should
take you to see a doctor.

16:43.902 --> 16:46.572
Maybe Andrea did say
something about the accident.

16:46.638 --> 16:48.707
Well, that must be it.

16:48.774 --> 16:51.210
And that nightmare,

16:51.276 --> 16:53.479
perhaps I've got it
all mixed up.

16:53.545 --> 16:55.914
I'm really sorry.

16:55.981 --> 16:58.050
-Of course I know Andrea.
-Maria.

17:00.552 --> 17:03.622
I have been so worried.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.958
I didn't hear a voice.
I was just making that up.

17:06.023 --> 17:07.626
But why, sweetheart?

17:07.693 --> 17:10.229
I don't know,
I think I just...

17:10.295 --> 17:11.663
I just wanted some attention.

17:11.730 --> 17:13.232
Is there something else wrong?
Something at school?

17:13.298 --> 17:16.435
-Have I done something wrong?
-No. It's just me.

17:16.502 --> 17:17.869
If there's anything you wanna
talk about,

17:17.935 --> 17:20.372
I'll give you all
the attention in the world.

17:20.439 --> 17:21.773
Thanks, Dad.

17:23.142 --> 17:25.644
But I think I should
go and see Andrea.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.479
I should go and say sorry.

17:27.546 --> 17:30.115
Oh, that's all right, love.

17:30.182 --> 17:32.785
There's no need to apologise.

17:32.851 --> 17:34.787
I remember when
I was your age,

17:34.853 --> 17:37.689
the thoughts
that would come
into my head sometimes.

17:37.756 --> 17:39.958
I don't know
where I got that name.

17:40.025 --> 17:41.794
Sarah Jane Smith.

17:41.860 --> 17:44.229
Means nothing to me, love.

17:44.296 --> 17:45.531
Positive?

17:46.498 --> 17:47.866
Positive.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.135
But how could you forget?

17:50.903 --> 17:52.805
1964.

17:52.871 --> 17:54.139
School trip. The pier.

17:54.206 --> 17:55.841
She fell. She died.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.109
And you were with her.

17:58.677 --> 18:00.979
-What?
-You lived, and she died.

18:01.046 --> 18:02.848
Only that wasn't
meant to happen.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.185
The key moment,

18:06.251 --> 18:08.153
when everything
in the world changed.

18:08.220 --> 18:09.855
Andrea, help me.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.558
Oh! What happened?
Take my hand!

18:13.559 --> 18:14.927
(SCREAMING)

18:14.993 --> 18:15.994
(SPLASH)

18:18.730 --> 18:19.865
Get out of my house!

18:22.100 --> 18:24.002
This isn't your house.

18:24.069 --> 18:26.205
This is some
kind of time gone wrong,

18:26.271 --> 18:27.639
because in my world,

18:27.706 --> 18:30.142
the way things
should have been,
you died!

18:30.909 --> 18:32.544
Get out!

18:32.611 --> 18:35.113
Enough of this.
I'm phoning your dad.
Get out!

18:35.180 --> 18:36.682
Just to let you know,

18:36.748 --> 18:38.283
I'm gonna sort things out,

18:38.350 --> 18:39.918
I'm gonna work out
how time got changed,

18:39.985 --> 18:41.787
I'm gonna find Sarah Jane,

18:41.854 --> 18:44.122
and then
I'm gonna bring her back,

18:44.189 --> 18:46.425
and nothing is gonna stop me.

18:50.996 --> 18:51.930
(DOOR SLAMS)

18:52.130 --> 18:52.931
No.

18:54.500 --> 18:55.667
Oh, no.

19:01.740 --> 19:04.409
That day. The pier.

19:05.177 --> 19:06.478
Oh, Sarah!

19:18.757 --> 19:22.361
MAN:
<i>Remember, Andrea.</i>

19:22.427 --> 19:24.930

19:50.289 --> 19:51.690
(WHISPERING) <i>Remember.</i>

19:53.058 --> 19:54.860
<i>Remember.</i>

19:56.795 --> 19:57.996
I forgot you.

20:00.399 --> 20:02.534
I forgot what I did that day.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.440
All these years,
living this life.

20:08.507 --> 20:11.143
<i>You forgot me, Andrea Yates.</i>

20:11.209 --> 20:13.879
<i>I never forgot you.</i>

20:21.687 --> 20:23.388
The day she died...

20:24.756 --> 20:26.558
You gave me this box.

20:26.625 --> 20:27.826
<i>My gift.</i>

20:30.095 --> 20:31.897
<i>Why are you calling me now?</i>

20:32.931 --> 20:35.867
Maria Jackson, over the road,

20:35.934 --> 20:39.605
all of a sudden, she keeps
going on about Sarah Jane.

20:39.671 --> 20:40.872
She knows.

20:42.307 --> 20:45.010
She knows what I did that day

20:46.945 --> 20:48.947
and she's made me remember.

20:49.781 --> 20:51.850
<i>She's just a child.</i>

20:53.318 --> 20:54.786
<i>Nobody will listen.</i>

20:54.853 --> 20:56.688
But I can't bear it.

20:57.789 --> 20:59.658
How could I forget?

21:00.459 --> 21:01.793
What I did.

21:03.495 --> 21:04.863
What we agreed.

21:08.734 --> 21:10.936
Did you make me forget?

21:11.136 --> 21:13.705
Your life is better,
is it not?

21:15.207 --> 21:18.076
-Yeah.
-Then what do you
want from me?

21:18.143 --> 21:20.912
Change her back
the way she was.

21:20.979 --> 21:22.681
The girl over the road.

21:22.748 --> 21:24.249
Make her forget.

21:24.316 --> 21:25.684
<i>I can't.</i>

21:25.751 --> 21:27.352
<i>There is a barrier.</i>

21:27.419 --> 21:30.155
<i>She is protected somehow.</i>

21:31.390 --> 21:33.492
<i>But I can remove her for you.</i>

21:33.558 --> 21:35.260
No! Not killing.

21:35.327 --> 21:37.429
<i>I cannot kill.</i>

21:37.496 --> 21:40.632
<i>But I can stop her</i>
<i>from ruining your life.</i>

21:41.633 --> 21:43.869
<i>One night's sleep</i>

<i>forget everything</i>
<i>once more.</i>

21:50.142 --> 21:51.476
Remove her where?

21:51.543 --> 21:53.545
<i>This need not concern you.</i>

21:54.713 --> 21:56.682
<i>But I need your agreement.</i>

21:56.748 --> 21:58.850
<i>Do I have your agreement?</i>

22:01.553 --> 22:03.689
-Yes!
-It shall be arranged.

22:05.223 --> 22:08.994
<i>But first, Andrea Yates,</i>

22:09.061 --> 22:12.397
<i>you must separate</i>
<i>the child from her father.</i>

SARAH JANE'S:
<i>Maria, please, help me.</i>

22:24.676 --> 22:27.145
(STAMMERING) What can I do?

22:27.212 --> 22:28.480
How do I start?

22:28.547 --> 22:31.016
The meteor! I can't
do anything to stop it.

22:32.551 --> 22:34.553
Why's it only me
who remembers you?

22:34.619 --> 22:35.854
<i>Maria, please.</i>

22:47.032 --> 22:48.934
Um, you sure you
don't mind giving me a hand?

22:49.134 --> 22:51.970
-No.
-It's just I've got
this banner for my birthday,

22:52.037 --> 22:53.205
and I want to put it up
over the door.

22:53.271 --> 22:54.706
Need another pair of hands.

22:54.773 --> 22:55.841
Sure you don't mind?

22:55.907 --> 22:57.743
No, it's not a problem.
Least I can do.

23:00.779 --> 23:01.847
(SIGHS)

23:15.494 --> 23:16.528
Yes!

23:18.063 --> 23:21.032
I've been so thick.

23:21.099 --> 23:23.568
You see, I've never really
gone big on birthdays
myself, you know.

23:23.635 --> 23:25.971
I don't like being
the centre of attention,
really.

23:26.037 --> 23:27.873
I used to when
I was a kid, you know.

23:27.939 --> 23:31.109
I had big birthday parties
there and bouncy castles
and stuff.

23:31.176 --> 23:32.644
Dad, I've worked it out.

23:32.711 --> 23:34.813
It's this box,
it protected me.

23:37.015 --> 23:38.116
Dad?

23:38.183 --> 23:39.451

23:55.634 --> 23:57.936
Maria? You okay?

24:00.105 --> 24:01.006
Maria?

24:11.383 --> 24:12.517
Maria?

24:26.198 --> 24:27.532

25:01.299 --> 25:03.768
-Help!
-CHRISSIE: Alan!

25:04.436 --> 25:05.837
Alan!

25:06.571 --> 25:08.106
Alan!

25:08.173 --> 25:09.407
(PANTING)

25:10.742 --> 25:12.811
Back door was wide open.

25:12.878 --> 25:15.947
-You wanna be careful.
-What was that?

25:16.014 --> 25:18.483
What was what?
Come on,
let's get over to Andrea's.

25:18.550 --> 25:21.353
-And what about Maria?
-Who?

25:21.419 --> 25:24.489
Ah, don't say you've finally
got yourself a new woman.

25:24.556 --> 25:27.092
-Maria was in here,
I think she's run off.
-What, already?

25:27.158 --> 25:29.928
Sensible woman,
whoever she is.
Took me 14 years.

25:30.128 --> 25:31.796
I mean Maria, our Maria.

25:31.863 --> 25:33.164
What do you mean, "Ours"?

25:33.231 --> 25:34.499
She's our daughter!

25:35.934 --> 25:37.702
Oh, Alan,
don't start messing about.

25:37.769 --> 25:40.438
I know you wanted kids,
but I never did.

25:40.505 --> 25:42.607
As if I've got
a maternal bone in my body!

25:42.674 --> 25:44.876
Chrissie, stop this now.
Maria's our daughter.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.512
There is no Maria.

25:47.579 --> 25:48.847
Maria doesn't exist!

26:29.988 --> 26:31.189
Come on, it'll be a laugh,

26:31.256 --> 26:33.191
better than that
crummy museum again!

26:33.258 --> 26:35.927
But it's dangerous,
they told us not to.

26:35.994 --> 26:38.163
-Oh, you're no fun!
-(SCOFFS)

26:38.229 --> 26:39.531
MAN: Candy floss!

26:39.597 --> 26:40.865
Excuse me.

26:42.500 --> 26:45.470
I'm gonna sound mad,
but where is this?

26:45.537 --> 26:47.405
You've got a nerve,
going out dressed like that.

26:47.472 --> 26:48.640
(LAUGHING) Look at her!

26:48.707 --> 26:50.475
Don't be so rude.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.544
-Are you all right?
-You look a bit lost.

26:52.610 --> 26:53.878
I think I am.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.114
I was in London.
I'm Maria Jackson.

26:57.716 --> 26:59.818
Pleased to meet you, Maria.
I'm Sarah Jane Smith.

27:05.390 --> 27:07.125
MARIA: July 13th, 1964!

27:07.192 --> 27:09.260
Sarah Jane,
you've got to believe me,

27:09.327 --> 27:11.262
you mustn't go down there.

27:11.329 --> 27:15.367
I took you to aid
the coming of darkness.

27:15.433 --> 27:17.869
Your life was so important

27:17.936 --> 27:21.406
and I found the right moment
to snuff it out.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.842
-You were meant to die.
-Meant?

27:23.908 --> 27:25.910
Who says I'm meant to die?

27:25.977 --> 27:28.346
I will return when
the Earth is no more.

27:28.413 --> 27:32.150
Don't you dare!
Don't you dare!

27:32.217 --> 27:33.718
Can you hear it? That's it.
