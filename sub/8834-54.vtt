How 'bout I do a little up-draft surfing?

01:18.250 --> 01:20.750

Oh, no!

[Kit] [screaming] Papa Bear!

01:46.959 --> 01:48.542
Kit, you OK?

01:49.291 --> 01:51.375
Yeah, I think so.

01:51.834 --> 01:54.208
[laughing] Cowabunga, Chief.

01:54.291 --> 01:58.458
[huffing] Real funny. What was that?

01:58.792 --> 02:02.458
You just shook hands
with a giant condor, my boy.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.583
-[Kit] A what?
-A local bird.

02:05.667 --> 02:06.875
Well, forget him.

02:07.375 --> 02:08.583
[Baloo] Ah, cheer up.

02:08.667 --> 02:12.291
Once we make this delivery
we've got a whole free weekend.

[villagers laughing]

02:17.917 --> 02:20.125
[indistinct chatter]

02:22.125 --> 02:24.625
[Baloo] Hey, Kit. Whatta you think?

02:25.125 --> 02:28.166
You think Becky'd like
one of these llama hats?

02:38.291 --> 02:39.792
[orgle]

02:40.417 --> 02:43.792
[groans] Easy, fuzzy. I'm not your mother.

02:44.291 --> 02:47.583
Kit? Hey, where'd you go?

02:48.041 --> 02:49.333
<i>Muchas gracias, señor.</i>

02:50.417 --> 02:54.375
That kid knows he's supposed
to stick close in strange places.

Kit!

02:56.083 --> 02:58.375
[Kit laughing]

02:59.375 --> 03:01.917
Hey, not my cap, little fellow.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.917
[in Spanish accent] Here, <i>muchaco</i>.
He likes to play with these.

03:05.333 --> 03:06.333
Thanks, lady.

03:06.792 --> 03:09.709
[panting] Now, where'd that kid go?

03:09.792 --> 03:11.041
[Kit] Hey, Baloo!

03:12.458 --> 03:16.542
Oh, Kit. I told you
not to go running off like that.

03:16.625 --> 03:18.959
-Sorry, Papa Bear.
-[woman gasps]

03:19.041 --> 03:21.458
-You have come at last.
-Huh?

03:21.542 --> 03:24.917
Welcome, oh, Great Llama.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.125
[mimicking Spanish accent]
Great Llama? [laughing]

03:27.208 --> 03:28.542
Oh, yeah, the hat.

03:29.458 --> 03:31.041
Good. No one saw you.

03:31.458 --> 03:34.750
At last. I have been expecting you.

03:34.834 --> 03:37.875
Listen, lady. I'm no Great Llama,

03:37.959 --> 03:40.041
just an Ordinary Joe with a silly hat.

03:40.125 --> 03:41.417
Sit. Sit.

03:41.959 --> 03:46.542
You have come to see Una
about the Idol of Doom.

03:46.959 --> 03:49.000
Idol? Lady, I...

03:49.208 --> 03:54.166
I am Una, the last of a line
of fortune tellers to inherit this.

03:54.250 --> 03:58.667
A long time we have waited
for you to come and claim it.

03:59.208 --> 04:00.917
Nice art work, but--

04:01.000 --> 04:06.917
Long ago, a horrible sorcerer
created a powerful weapon...

04:07.000 --> 04:10.083
The Idol of Doom.

04:10.166 --> 04:14.583
The sorcerer used it
to terrorize our people.

04:14.917 --> 04:19.458
So they finally rose up
and took it from him.

04:19.875 --> 04:22.375
But, alas,
they could not destroy the Idol.

04:22.458 --> 04:25.500
So they hid it in a deep secret temple

04:26.000 --> 04:31.500
until the day when a hero would come
to destroy the evil forever.

04:31.583 --> 04:35.000
Oh, boy. Look at the time.
I gotta run. [nervous chuckle]

04:35.083 --> 04:37.792
-Whoa!
-Here. Take this band.

04:38.208 --> 04:42.458
It will lead you
and protect you on your quest.

04:42.542 --> 04:46.542
Oh, no, no.
I don't go in much for flashy jewelry.

04:46.625 --> 04:50.375
You must find the Idol
before it falls into evil hands.

04:51.333 --> 04:52.917
It is your destiny.

04:53.417 --> 04:56.500
Your quest awaits, oh, Great Llama.
Do not fail us.

04:57.667 --> 04:58.500
Hey!

05:00.750 --> 05:03.667
Gee, Kit, where'd you dig up that fossil?

05:03.750 --> 05:06.709
Wow, Baloo! She said you're on a quest.

05:07.208 --> 05:10.542
Well, I'll be off it in just a second.

05:10.625 --> 05:12.041
I don't know, Baloo.

05:12.125 --> 05:14.083
Maybe you should keep it on.

05:14.166 --> 05:17.000
Una said it's supposed
to lead you on your quest.

05:17.083 --> 05:20.375
For the last time, Kit,
I'm not going anywhere.

05:20.458 --> 05:22.166
Whoa!

05:22.250 --> 05:24.417
[Kit] Hold on tight, Papa Bear!

05:24.500 --> 05:27.250
[Baloo] But I'm trying to let go.

05:28.166 --> 05:29.583
Whoa!

05:33.166 --> 05:35.041
[Kit straining]

05:35.125 --> 05:37.166
-[Baloo groans]
-Whoa!

05:39.125 --> 05:42.583
[Kit and Baloo yelling]

05:51.542 --> 05:53.250
Baloo! Are you OK?

05:53.792 --> 05:57.417
Give me a month to recover
and I'll let you know.

05:58.250 --> 06:01.125
[El Gato, in Spanish accent]
Where is the Idol, old woman?

06:01.667 --> 06:03.291
Safe from your evil hands.

06:03.375 --> 06:05.458
[cawing]

06:05.959 --> 06:11.041
I've been searching for years
and now I've found you at last!

06:12.333 --> 06:14.500
You're too late, El Gato.

06:14.583 --> 06:18.458
The Great Llama
is already searching for it.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.625
-[laughing] Great Llama, indeed.
-[bird laughing and cawing]

06:23.709 --> 06:24.542
Find him!

06:27.250 --> 06:31.125
[Baloo] Ouch! I just wanna go home.

06:31.625 --> 06:32.959
Wait a sec, Baloo.

06:33.041 --> 06:35.417
The map says we should go that way.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.333
Nuh-uh, Little Britches.
Nope, <i>nada </i>, no way.

06:38.417 --> 06:39.750
I'm outta here.

06:39.834 --> 06:42.166
But what about your destiny?

06:42.250 --> 06:45.000
[Baloo] Repeat:
I do not believe in that stuff.

06:45.583 --> 06:48.583
[grunts] Give me a hand
with this junk jewelry, kiddo.

06:49.083 --> 06:53.250
[grunts] OK, Baloo, but I think
we should check this map out.

06:53.333 --> 06:57.083
Uh-uh.
The only thing that's checking out is me.

06:57.166 --> 07:00.417
[yelling and grunting]

07:00.917 --> 07:01.709
[Kit] Baloo!

07:02.083 --> 07:05.667
Call the coast guard!

07:05.750 --> 07:09.375
[screaming]

07:12.000 --> 07:14.583
Somebody get me a lifeguard!

07:14.667 --> 07:17.542
[screaming, gurgling]

07:20.917 --> 07:22.709
We will find him.

07:22.792 --> 07:25.542
The first thing is to look for clues.

07:26.041 --> 07:29.709
The smallest detail
should not be overlooked.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.125
Just what do you think you are doing?

07:33.208 --> 07:36.875
Don't you see me over here detectiving
while you sit in the shade?

07:36.959 --> 07:39.208
I want you to make like a bloodhound.

07:39.875 --> 07:43.125
Sniff-sniff-sniff. Get the scent.
Sniff it out. You understand?

07:43.208 --> 07:44.500
[cawing]

07:44.583 --> 07:48.041
Oh, chihuahua! Pick up the scent, idiot!

07:53.000 --> 07:54.125
[caws]

07:56.333 --> 07:58.583
We're not talking hygiene here.

07:58.667 --> 08:01.250
Think llama, llama.

08:01.333 --> 08:02.500
Now go!

08:03.208 --> 08:05.417
Keep flapping!

08:09.792 --> 08:12.583
I hate their feathers,
their beady little eyes,

08:12.667 --> 08:14.625
and those boney little knees.

08:16.041 --> 08:18.834
Whoa!

08:20.792 --> 08:21.625
[caws]

08:22.792 --> 08:25.583
What you are staring at?
I'm taking a break.

08:27.375 --> 08:29.125
Pick up the trail.

08:29.959 --> 08:31.250
Am I close?

08:31.333 --> 08:33.207
Give me a signal.

08:33.291 --> 08:37.332
Am I warmer? Am I colder? What?

08:37.417 --> 08:41.332
Am I... [gasps, screams]

08:42.875 --> 08:44.375
[loud thud]

08:46.083 --> 08:47.834
[cawing]

08:47.917 --> 08:51.542
[El Gato] [echoing] Somehow,
I expected more from you.

08:51.834 --> 08:54.125
Only I, the boss, takes breaks.

08:54.208 --> 08:55.375
Not the crow!

08:56.250 --> 08:57.208
[cawing]

08:57.291 --> 08:58.291
Did you find somethings?

09:05.667 --> 09:08.208
I stay here. You bring me a sign back.

09:08.875 --> 09:14.792
I have to calculate factors
such as distance and wind condition,

09:14.875 --> 09:18.000
the position of the Sun...
Little type things.

09:19.834 --> 09:22.417
Not a <i>sign </i> sign, you flea bag.

09:22.500 --> 09:23.834
A sign!

09:25.458 --> 09:27.458
Wait, wait, wait. <i>Uno momento.</i>

09:33.542 --> 09:35.417
Baloo? Baloo!

09:37.959 --> 09:40.333
[hooting]

09:40.417 --> 09:43.083
[screaming]

09:45.041 --> 09:46.875
Baloo! Baloo!

09:46.959 --> 09:48.250
You all right?

09:48.792 --> 09:50.792

09:52.834 --> 09:55.792
[Kit laughing hysterically]

09:55.875 --> 09:58.625
Oh, poor wittle Baloo.

09:58.709 --> 10:01.333
Did he fall down and go boom?

10:01.417 --> 10:04.917
Well, ha ha. Here's mud in your eye.

10:05.041 --> 10:07.709
[Kit laughing] Here.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.709
Baloo, it's the temple.

10:11.792 --> 10:15.041
-[Baloo gulps]
-[Kit] This really is your destiny.

10:15.125 --> 10:20.041
No. I'd say this is
nature's plan to ruin my weekend.

10:21.750 --> 10:22.917
Baloo, look.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.875
The llama from the scroll.

10:25.375 --> 10:30.750
Just because this is an old temple
doesn't mean the Idol of Doom is in there.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.041
Uh-oh! Hey, let go! [grunting]

10:35.125 --> 10:37.458
-Close sesame!
-[loud thud]

10:37.709 --> 10:39.792
[yelling]

10:43.166 --> 10:44.208
Destiny.

10:44.291 --> 10:46.709
Stop saying that.

10:46.792 --> 10:48.875
Wow! Come on, Baloo.

10:48.959 --> 10:51.959
OK, we'll give it a look-see.

10:56.083 --> 10:57.041
Careful, Kit.

10:58.208 --> 11:00.875
Whoa! What kind of tunnel is this?

11:00.959 --> 11:02.583
[laughing] A wind tunnel.

11:04.417 --> 11:07.208
According to this,
the Idol's in the next chamber.

11:07.291 --> 11:11.083
If there is an idol in there,
then I'm a groundhog.

11:12.834 --> 11:16.375
Baloo, you better start
looking for your shadow.

11:16.458 --> 11:17.291
Huh?

11:17.375 --> 11:19.667
[Kit] The Idol of Doom!

11:19.667 --> 11:22.583
Who'd have guessed the old lady was right?

11:24.041 --> 11:25.250
Wow!

11:25.333 --> 11:28.625
Probably worth a couple of bucks too.

11:28.709 --> 11:30.750
[bird cawing]

11:33.250 --> 11:34.083
Hey!

11:37.917 --> 11:40.750
[Baloo] Hey, pal, we found that first.

11:40.834 --> 11:45.542
So, you are the legendary Great Llama.

11:45.625 --> 11:48.000
Well, not exactly.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.375
I thought not.

11:49.458 --> 11:52.917
Imagine trusting the Idol
to a buffoon like you.

11:53.000 --> 11:53.959
Now hold on.

11:54.041 --> 11:56.208
But since you are here,

11:56.291 --> 11:59.583
I will give you
a demonstration of its power.

11:59.667 --> 12:02.959
Idol of Doom, storm and fire,

12:03.041 --> 12:06.208
blast this cavern per my desire.

12:07.917 --> 12:09.125
[screaming]

12:11.667 --> 12:13.417
Enjoy the show.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.667
[laughing villainously]

12:18.959 --> 12:20.834
[rumbling]

12:21.875 --> 12:23.417
Let's climb out of here.

12:25.250 --> 12:26.417
Oh, great!

12:28.834 --> 12:30.834
I got an idea!

12:38.000 --> 12:40.125
Baloo, catch!

12:42.959 --> 12:46.041
Whoa!

12:54.458 --> 12:58.583
[grunts] I hated this stuff in gym class.

12:59.583 --> 13:02.875
Oh, man, this is supposed
to be my weekend off.

13:02.959 --> 13:04.709
Shh.

13:05.792 --> 13:08.625
[grunts] I blasted this place too hard.

13:10.709 --> 13:12.667
No, no. That's no good.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.959
-Here. Take the idol.
-[Baloo] You shouldn't have.

13:16.041 --> 13:16.875
What?

13:18.083 --> 13:21.250
See, Kit? I told you
he'd give it back nicely.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.917
Now how's that little ditty go again?

13:26.417 --> 13:29.125
Idol of Doom, storm and fire...

13:29.208 --> 13:31.917
Oh, yeah. Idol of Doom, storm and fire...

13:32.000 --> 13:34.041
[grunting]

13:34.125 --> 13:35.417
Look out!

13:36.375 --> 13:38.500
Flatten that creep like a bicycle tire.

13:38.583 --> 13:39.417
[ding]

13:46.000 --> 13:49.834
Not bad for a buffoon, huh? Ta-ta.

13:49.917 --> 13:52.458
[El Gato] [echoing]
I'll follow you wherever you go.

13:52.542 --> 13:56.333
[laughing] Good luck, pal.
We've got the only plane in town.

13:56.417 --> 14:00.041
[El Gato] [echoing]
It doesn't matter. I'll get you!

14:00.959 --> 14:02.834
Now you have to destroy it, Baloo.

14:03.250 --> 14:04.250
Nothing doing.

14:04.333 --> 14:08.542
Once I take it back
to the old lady, it's her problem.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.000
[Kit] Why is the door open?

14:14.500 --> 14:16.125
Ah, hello.

14:16.208 --> 14:17.250
Lady?

14:17.709 --> 14:19.083
Oooh!

14:21.041 --> 14:24.125
Oh, my. I'm sorry. It's you.

14:24.208 --> 14:26.500
I'm sorry it's me too.

14:26.875 --> 14:29.291
Come in. Come in.

14:31.291 --> 14:32.917
OK, lady, here it is.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.375
[gasps] Oh, good. El Gato didn't get it.

14:35.458 --> 14:36.959
You mean the guy with the crow?

14:37.041 --> 14:39.208
Yes. He was here.

14:39.291 --> 14:41.250
You mean he did this?

14:43.291 --> 14:47.834
Picking on defenseless people...
I wish I could teach that jerk a lesson.

14:47.834 --> 14:51.709
But you can.
Destroy the Idol before he gets it.

14:51.792 --> 14:54.291
Complete your destiny.

14:54.375 --> 14:56.125
Stop saying that.

14:56.208 --> 15:00.083
Uh! Lady, listen.
I don't know how to get rid of this thing.

15:00.166 --> 15:04.583
Of course, Great Llama.
Forgive an old lady.

15:04.667 --> 15:07.709
[groans] OK. OK.

15:07.792 --> 15:09.750
I'll see what I can do.

15:09.834 --> 15:11.917
But then I've really got to leave.

15:14.959 --> 15:18.083
[Baloo] This thing is driving me crazy!

15:18.166 --> 15:20.834
Come on, you!

15:21.709 --> 15:22.500
[ding]

15:23.709 --> 15:25.375
[screaming]

15:25.458 --> 15:28.750
Whoa!

15:31.333 --> 15:32.500
Ouch!

15:32.583 --> 15:34.375
I'm not even gonna ask.

15:35.208 --> 15:39.542
I can't bust this thing! [screaming]

15:39.625 --> 15:42.000
Easy. Don't lose it, Papa Bear.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.458
Lose it. Lose it.

15:44.542 --> 15:48.959
Yeah. That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

15:50.375 --> 15:53.542
[Baloo] OK, Kit,
let's deep six this bookend.

15:53.625 --> 15:55.959
Bye-bye, sweetheart.

16:05.000 --> 16:09.083
Give me the quickest way
out of this country, Little Britches.

16:09.375 --> 16:13.083
Baloo! Four o'clock!
Unidentified flying... idol?

16:14.208 --> 16:15.041
Oh, baby.

16:24.041 --> 16:27.000
[panting]

16:29.375 --> 16:30.792
Uh-oh. Guess who wants in.

16:31.250 --> 16:32.208
[Baloo] Oh, no, no, no.

16:33.041 --> 16:34.458
I said, no!

16:34.875 --> 16:36.709
Why are you following me?

16:36.792 --> 16:38.375
'Cause you're the Great Llama?

16:38.583 --> 16:40.125
Oh, man.

16:40.208 --> 16:43.792
Maybe there's something
to this destiny thing after all.

16:47.834 --> 16:49.417
What's happening?

16:50.083 --> 16:51.417
Jumping canaries!

16:51.500 --> 16:54.125
[both yelling]

16:56.709 --> 16:58.750
-[squawking]
-[Kit] What is it?

16:58.834 --> 17:00.458
It's a giant condor!

17:04.458 --> 17:06.458
I told you I'd find you.

17:06.875 --> 17:08.709
It's that crazy El Gato.

17:09.916 --> 17:11.750
[both screaming]

17:17.625 --> 17:21.165
[laughing] At last, it's mine!

17:24.709 --> 17:27.416
Idol of Doom, storm and fire,

17:27.500 --> 17:30.500
blast that plane higher and higher.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.291
[thunder rumbling]

17:37.750 --> 17:39.959
[Baloo and Kit screaming]

17:47.583 --> 17:50.667
I never liked this insignificant town.

17:50.750 --> 17:53.500
Idol of Doom, storm and fire,

17:53.583 --> 17:56.792
blast that hill, 'tis my desire.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.542
[villagers screaming]

18:12.792 --> 18:17.208
[laughing] That's it. Run, you ants.

18:19.917 --> 18:22.208
Come on, baby. Come on.

18:26.291 --> 18:29.458
[grunts] Good going, sweetheart.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.458
Look, Baloo. He's wrecking the city.

18:32.583 --> 18:35.959
That tears it!
Kit, let's buzz that buzzard.

18:36.041 --> 18:37.291
Roger that.

18:46.792 --> 18:47.625
[buzzing]

18:47.709 --> 18:48.542
[squawks]

18:51.875 --> 18:55.083
Hey, I can't see
nothing but tail feathers.

18:58.250 --> 19:00.125
Pull up, Baloo! Go!

19:01.041 --> 19:02.291
[Baloo] Think thin!

19:06.083 --> 19:08.083
[growls] Get him!

19:15.542 --> 19:18.250
[Kit] Baloo, he's got the aileron!

19:18.667 --> 19:20.000
She's jammed!

19:29.834 --> 19:32.166
Sit tight, Kit.
I've got to knock it loose.

19:39.291 --> 19:40.166
Great.

19:40.291 --> 19:41.250
Whoa!

19:45.625 --> 19:48.625
Oh, baby. You saved me.

19:48.709 --> 19:50.291
Just like Una said.

19:50.792 --> 19:51.792
[squawking]

19:51.875 --> 19:53.166
[screaming]

19:55.542 --> 19:56.750
Baloo!

19:57.875 --> 19:59.792
I come here for a quiet weekend

19:59.875 --> 20:03.375
and I end up fighting
an overgrown parakeet.

20:03.458 --> 20:06.000
OK, pal, we're in this together.

20:06.083 --> 20:08.041
Do you stuff, bangle.

20:10.041 --> 20:11.583
What is going on?

20:11.667 --> 20:14.125
[Baloo] A present from the Great Llama.

20:14.208 --> 20:18.166
-[El Gato grunting]
-[bird squawking]

20:19.583 --> 20:22.709
[laughing] Pop fly to shortstop.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.375
[screaming]

20:27.125 --> 20:30.375
Well, what do you know? I got her unstuck.

20:30.458 --> 20:34.750
OK, my turn. Idol of Doom, storm and fire,

20:34.834 --> 20:37.667
come on, Little Llama, grant my desire.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.417
Pluck that chicken.

20:41.250 --> 20:43.166
[squawking]

20:50.000 --> 20:55.834
Can anyone direct me
to the nearest bus stop?

20:55.917 --> 20:57.625
[El Gato groans]

21:03.709 --> 21:08.417
Well, you were right, lady.
This little baby saved my life.

21:08.834 --> 21:10.917
Then its work is done.

21:12.917 --> 21:14.834
But yours is not.

21:15.792 --> 21:18.375
You still must destroy the Idol.

21:18.458 --> 21:19.542
Yeah, Baloo.

21:19.625 --> 21:24.291
Hey, no sweat, folks.
The Great Llama's got all the answers.

21:25.542 --> 21:29.166
Idol of Doom, storm and fire,

21:29.250 --> 21:32.792
in a swirl of smoke you will expire.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.959
[gasps] You did it, Great Llama.

21:37.875 --> 21:41.500
See? It was your destiny.

21:42.458 --> 21:47.250
Maybe it was at that.
Well, so long, sister.

21:47.333 --> 21:50.208
Thanks for a wild weekend.

21:52.166 --> 21:54.667
You were a great Great Llama, Baloo.

21:54.750 --> 21:57.291
Yeah, and I predict the future too.

21:57.375 --> 22:00.250
I see you and me sitting at Louie's,

22:00.333 --> 22:04.583
sharing a triple-decker hot fudge sundae,

22:04.667 --> 22:06.542
with extra sprinkles.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.250
How'd you know that?

22:08.333 --> 22:11.417
I'd say it's our destiny.
