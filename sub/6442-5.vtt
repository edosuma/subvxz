00:24.457 --> 00:26.425
Scientists are calling today's impact...

00:26.593 --> 00:30.222
...one of the most significant
astronomical events of the last century.

00:30.397 --> 00:34.128
The enormous solar flare
has already caused power surges....

00:34.300 --> 00:35.961
Clark!

00:36.636 --> 00:39.002
Hey, Clark. Son, you wanna
give us a hand here?

00:39.172 --> 00:42.141
Yeah. Sorry, I must've got sucked in.

00:42.308 --> 00:44.606
You caught me in the middle
of this news special.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.439
What's the topic?

00:46.613 --> 00:49.104
Solar flares and the effects
on Earth's atmosphere.

00:49.282 --> 00:52.080
According to NASA, the sun took
a direct hit from a comet...

00:52.252 --> 00:54.413
...causing one of the biggest
solar flares ever.

00:54.587 --> 00:57.715
-You sound intrigued.
-Actually, it's a relief to be researching...

00:57.891 --> 01:01.019
...a cosmic disaster that has
nothing to do with me.

01:01.961 --> 01:04.896
I gotta go. I told Pete I'd meet him
at the Talon to swap notes.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.193
-You need a ride?
-No, I think I'll run it.

01:08.368 --> 01:10.165
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:10.336 --> 01:14.466
--precipitates huge explosions
with powerful, far-reached effects.

01:14.641 --> 01:17.041
The shock wave from this type
of CME is so strong...

01:17.210 --> 01:21.943
...that it smashes the Earth 's magnetic
field, unleashing a geomagnetic storm.

01:22.115 --> 01:24.379
In layman 's terms,
people should expect....

01:24.551 --> 01:27.850
Do you believe that there are powers
greater than we can know...

01:28.021 --> 01:30.080
...somewhere in the universe?

01:30.256 --> 01:31.780
Sure.

01:32.859 --> 01:36.022
Look, do you mind if I switch
back to the game?

01:40.467 --> 01:45.962
That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for the Metropolis Sharks.

01:49.676 --> 01:51.541
To Littleville, Kansas...

01:51.711 --> 01:54.145
...and all the little "Kans-ass-ians" in it.

01:57.283 --> 02:00.184
-One more.
-Look, pal, we don't want any trouble here.

02:00.353 --> 02:02.685
I think you might have had enough.

02:03.189 --> 02:07.523
If you want trouble,
you just try cutting me off.

02:15.902 --> 02:17.301
Don't come back.

02:19.305 --> 02:22.069
Small-town friendly, my butt.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.087
No-- Yeah--

02:36.256 --> 02:38.349
No, I'll find it.

02:38.525 --> 02:40.459
Yeah, I know. This--

02:41.060 --> 02:44.223
Yeah. No. No, I have not been drinking.

02:44.397 --> 02:46.365
Thank you for caring.

03:31.644 --> 03:32.872
You okay?

03:33.046 --> 03:37.073
You pulled the door right off the car
with your bare hands?

03:37.750 --> 03:42.653
-You walked right through the power lines.
-You're a little drunk, Mr....

03:43.957 --> 03:45.481
White.

03:45.658 --> 03:47.853
Perry White.

05:15.048 --> 05:18.245
-Take it easy, Clark.
-I misjudged my strength.

05:18.418 --> 05:20.386
I just got off the phone
with the hospital.

05:20.553 --> 05:23.351
It seems your Mr. Perry White
checked himself out last night.

05:23.523 --> 05:25.320
His Breathalyzer was off the charts.

05:25.491 --> 05:29.825
-What do you think he saw, son?
-He probably doesn't remember my name.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.960
Clark! Clark Kent!

05:34.334 --> 05:36.029
Thank you.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.473
Yeah.

05:42.475 --> 05:44.875
Last time I saw you,
you were Frisbee-ing the door...

05:45.044 --> 05:47.308
...off my car and ignoring
the high-voltage lines.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.742
Mr. White.

05:48.915 --> 05:52.874
I was trying to figure out which of the four
Clarks to thank when they hauled me off.

05:53.052 --> 05:54.815
-You must be Mr. Kent.
-Yes, I am.

05:54.987 --> 05:58.423
-I'm certainly glad you're feeling better.
-Well, that's relative.

05:58.591 --> 06:00.081
My car is crunched.

06:00.259 --> 06:05.287
This hillbilly cartoon you have as a sheriff
has suspended my license on a DUl...

06:05.465 --> 06:08.093
...and my assignment editor is
screaming for my head.

06:08.267 --> 06:09.859
You're a reporter?

06:10.136 --> 06:12.263
In a past life.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.799
At the moment,
I'm the advance man for X-Styles...

06:15.975 --> 06:18.603
...cable TV's one stop
for the paranormally inclined.

06:18.778 --> 06:20.370
What brings you here to Smallville?

06:20.546 --> 06:22.946
I'm researching a piece
about the meteor shower...

06:23.116 --> 06:25.812
...and the bizarre phenomena
that it spawned.

06:25.985 --> 06:30.354
-Don't tell me you believe any of that.
-It's right up there with the tooth fairy.

06:35.628 --> 06:38.995
Don't you need tools for a job like that?

06:40.233 --> 06:44.067
Mr. White, you really didn't come
all this way just to thank me, did you?

06:44.971 --> 06:48.065
No, I didn't. I thought
we should discuss a settlement.

06:48.241 --> 06:52.143
-Settlement?
-I didn't off-road my car for laughs.

06:52.311 --> 06:54.404
I swerved to miss your son.

06:56.682 --> 06:59.014
Look, I'll make this easy on you.
I need a local...

06:59.185 --> 07:02.211
...who knows the territory
to ferry me around.

07:02.388 --> 07:05.653
You loan me Clark for a couple days,
we'll call it even.

07:12.598 --> 07:17.626
My father went for historical accuracy
when he had the mansion reconstructed...

07:17.804 --> 07:21.205
...but I was thinking of taking
some liberties with the decor.

07:21.374 --> 07:25.276
Move away from the artifacts
and period pieces...

07:25.445 --> 07:27.470
...and go with something more modern.

07:27.647 --> 07:29.808
Even abstract.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.083
Any thoughts, doctor?

07:32.251 --> 07:35.948
Only that I hoped today's session
would be more productive.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.654
I believe the psychological term...

07:38.825 --> 07:42.420
...for refusing to accept
the inevitable is "denial."

07:42.595 --> 07:46.224
And no amount of probing can uncover
emotional issues that don't exist.

07:46.399 --> 07:50.426
-Now who's in denial?
-Trust me, I have nothing to hide.

07:52.004 --> 07:53.699
Then tell me about the island.

07:53.873 --> 07:58.537
The fisherman who found you said you
were raving about some imaginary enemy.

07:59.245 --> 08:01.645
I was ill, suffering from malaria.

08:01.814 --> 08:05.773
I saw your blood work, Lex.
There was no trace of disease.

08:06.085 --> 08:09.612
But even some fictitious illness
would not explain your reluctance...

08:09.789 --> 08:13.725
...to discuss your conflicted feelings
towards your father. Until we understand--

08:13.893 --> 08:17.829
What I understand, doctor,
is that LuthorCorp's insurance carrier...

08:17.997 --> 08:21.990
...insisted that I submit to five
psychiatric therapy sessions.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.931
So I've submitted.

08:27.073 --> 08:31.737
And sadly, our final hour is up.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.270
I'll miss our sessions.

08:53.132 --> 08:55.600
Two meteor craters?
You don't wanna see anything else?

08:55.768 --> 08:58.703
Well, blown-out buildings and sinkholes
are background, Clark.

08:58.871 --> 09:02.568
I'm looking for substance, texture...

09:03.209 --> 09:05.404
...the human dimension.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.576
Clark, is everything all right?

09:07.747 --> 09:10.375
Pete waited for you until
after 1 0:00 last night.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.815
-It's a long story.
-Hi. Perry White.

09:13.986 --> 09:18.150
I'd like a triple cappuccino and a couple
of those glazed crullers...

09:18.324 --> 09:21.157
...and an interview...

09:21.594 --> 09:24.358
...with Smallville's very own cover girl.

09:28.634 --> 09:30.625
What are you doing?

09:30.937 --> 09:32.564
It's called getting the story.

09:32.738 --> 09:35.332
Nothing fancy, Miss Lang,
just a simple q and a.

09:35.741 --> 09:40.644
You know, how's Little Miss Meteor coping
1 4 years after the big bang?

09:41.881 --> 09:46.147
Maybe this is a joke to you,
but my parents died that day.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.549
And I'm sorry,
but that makes you newsworthy.

09:50.189 --> 09:51.816
That's it. You're leaving.

09:52.525 --> 09:55.858
Either she talks to me now,
or she faces the cameras in the morning.

09:56.028 --> 09:58.428
-Clark, I can't believe you're with this guy.
-Lana.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.964
Maybe you should both leave.

10:02.201 --> 10:04.533
You didn't tell me Lana was
part of your agenda.

10:04.704 --> 10:06.695
You didn't tell me you knew her.

10:06.872 --> 10:09.705
Sorry if I hurt her feelings,
but she's a legitimate source.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.968
-She's not anymore.
-lt doesn't work that way.

10:12.144 --> 10:14.612
I still have to find faces
to put on camera.

10:14.780 --> 10:18.511
Your high school paper has developed
quite a rep in the bug-eyed monster circles.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.845
Why would you say that?

10:21.354 --> 10:25.518
Because I did, like, three minutes
of research before I came to town.

10:25.725 --> 10:28.558
Think the editor would know something
about the meteor shower?

10:28.728 --> 10:30.457
How would I know?

10:31.797 --> 10:35.699
"' Principal Authorizes New Gym Mats'
by Clark Kent."

10:36.235 --> 10:38.635
I know I was riveted.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.334
I think we should go.

10:46.512 --> 10:50.004
Boy, I thought our stuff was off-the-wall.
This is incredible.

10:50.182 --> 10:52.116
It's also all true.

10:52.284 --> 10:55.082
Chloe, Mr. White is interested
in the meteor shower.

10:55.254 --> 10:57.848
-I thought he could take a look.
-I have nothing to hide.

10:58.024 --> 11:02.427
Oh, good. I think we've already borrowed
two or three of your ideas for our show.

11:02.595 --> 11:06.656
Now, do you make it all up yourself,
or do you pull in other writers?

11:07.667 --> 11:12.229
-Excuse me?
-Oh, just professional curiosity.

11:12.405 --> 11:15.465
It's rare that I meet another journalist
interested in the bizarre.

11:15.641 --> 11:18.075
-X-Styles?
-Yeah.

11:18.244 --> 11:22.476
I have a penchant for the truth, something
your TV show gave up around episode two.

11:22.648 --> 11:24.878
That's it. We're done.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.982
Wait, wait, wait.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.683
You're the Perry White?

11:39.231 --> 11:41.358
It's okay. I'm gonna hoof it
back to the motel.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.161
You young lovers patch things up...

11:43.335 --> 11:46.566
...and then later on you can swing by,
and we'll pick up the tour.

11:49.508 --> 11:53.137
Clark, do you have any idea
who that was?

12:13.799 --> 12:15.289
Lex.

12:16.235 --> 12:20.035
-I'm sorry. I'm interrupting.
-No.

12:20.339 --> 12:22.136
It's strange.

12:22.308 --> 12:25.402
When I was on the island,
I came to hate the roar of the ocean.

12:25.778 --> 12:29.578
Since coming back, I find
it's the only thing that relaxes me.

12:30.983 --> 12:33.543
You must think about what happened
every day.

12:34.620 --> 12:37.987
And I'm sure you didn't come
all this way to discuss that.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.757
What did you wanna see me about?

12:43.863 --> 12:47.230
This tabloid television reporter
came by the Talon today...

12:47.399 --> 12:51.335
...and he wanted to do an interview
with me about the meteor shower.

12:51.570 --> 12:54.198
A succinct "no comment"
didn't dissuade him?

12:55.407 --> 13:00.344
Not really. He said he'd come back
tomorrow, this time with a camera crew.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.340
And you don't want that.

13:02.882 --> 13:06.978
I've spent the last 1 4 years
trying to put that day behind me.

13:07.153 --> 13:09.713
And in an instant...

13:09.889 --> 13:11.447
...he brought it all back.

13:14.026 --> 13:16.551
I know it's a lot to ask...

13:17.163 --> 13:21.031
...but I was hoping that you might
be able to do something.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.032
I'm surprised you didn't go
to Clark with this.

13:29.608 --> 13:31.269
Clark's with him.

13:34.013 --> 13:36.140
So you want me to run him out of town?

13:37.650 --> 13:39.481
I want him to stop.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.851
He must've been very persistent.

13:43.022 --> 13:46.287
-What was his name?
-Perry White.

13:48.928 --> 13:51.556
I'll make sure he never bothers you again.

14:00.606 --> 14:03.370
Mr. White, I've been looking for you.

14:03.709 --> 14:05.199
And here I am.

14:05.377 --> 14:08.312
You may have the makings
of a reporter yet, Kent.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.107
Like you used to be?

14:11.784 --> 14:14.116
Chloe and I did some checking
after you left.

14:15.454 --> 14:19.288
Memories fade,
but a Google search never forgets.

14:19.458 --> 14:21.790
And another drink isn't gonna
erase the fact...

14:21.961 --> 14:25.692
...that you used to be one of the best
reporters in Metropolis.

14:26.065 --> 14:27.464
What happened?

14:28.901 --> 14:31.392
Life is a journey, grasshopper.

14:31.570 --> 14:34.869
And sometimes the trip is smoother
with a little lubricant.

14:36.342 --> 14:38.469
What's it to you, anyway?

14:40.045 --> 14:42.513
Maybe it's the journalist in me...

14:42.681 --> 14:46.515
...or that I realized, if you have a gift,
you shouldn't turn your back on it.

14:49.355 --> 14:52.483
I made exactly two mistakes
in my life, kid.

14:52.658 --> 14:55.126
The first was getting into journalism.

14:55.494 --> 14:59.658
-What was the second?
-Thinking it mattered.

15:00.332 --> 15:04.200
-One more.
-No, he's had enough.

15:06.272 --> 15:08.297
I don't get you, kid.

15:08.474 --> 15:11.068
I strong-armed your parents,
picked on your girlfriend...

15:11.243 --> 15:12.870
...and ticked off your lady editor.

15:13.045 --> 15:15.775
Still, here you are,
trying to play the hero.

15:15.948 --> 15:19.577
Sometimes Clark's faith in his fellow
man outweighs his common sense.

15:22.221 --> 15:23.984
Lex?

15:24.857 --> 15:27.655
It's all right, Clark.
I'll deal with Mr. White from here.

15:27.826 --> 15:29.817
I may have underestimated you, kid.

15:31.196 --> 15:33.164
Clark doesn't have anything
to do with this.

15:33.332 --> 15:37.200
Look, if this is your old man's idea, tell him
I got the message back in Metropolis.

15:37.369 --> 15:40.805
-I have no intention of revisiting the past.
-This isn't about my father.

15:40.973 --> 15:44.465
-It's about you.
-Lex, don't you think you're overreacting?

15:44.643 --> 15:48.636
Considering the way he went after Lana,
I thought you'd admire my restrain.

15:51.050 --> 15:54.247
-Let's go.
-Thanks for the ride, kid.

16:17.977 --> 16:22.607
You know, this "get out of Dodge" routine
is pretty heavy-handed, even for a Luthor.

16:22.781 --> 16:25.978
So is ambushing a teenage girl
for a sound bite.

16:26.151 --> 16:29.120
Of course, using people
always came easy to you.

16:29.288 --> 16:32.280
You know, our one and only
encounter was years ago.

16:33.292 --> 16:36.227
Even in boarding school,
I was good at sniffing out reporters...

16:36.395 --> 16:39.728
...but you played the "just a friendly
conversation" card very well.

16:40.099 --> 16:43.296
As I recall, it was a full 1 0 minutes
before I told you to go to hell.

16:43.736 --> 16:47.001
I was just doing my job,
and you were a legitimate source.

16:47.172 --> 16:50.107
I was 1 6, and you were scrounging
for dirt on my father.

16:50.576 --> 16:52.908
That's what this is really about, isn't it?

16:53.078 --> 16:54.670
Your father's secrets?

16:56.048 --> 16:59.347
If you really had anything on him,
it would've come out then.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.783
If you actually believe that,
I almost feel sorry for you.

17:03.922 --> 17:06.117
Just make sure you're on the 4:00 bus.

17:26.211 --> 17:30.113
Well, so much for not drinking before 5.

17:30.949 --> 17:32.507
Hey, Dad.

17:32.684 --> 17:34.242
Hey.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.980
Hey, Clark.
I wasn't expecting you till later.

17:37.156 --> 17:39.624
-Where's Mr. White?
-He left.

17:39.792 --> 17:43.523
I think he realized that Smallville wasn't
quite as friendly as he first thought.

17:43.762 --> 17:46.731
I've been trying to wrestle this thing
up on a block for an hour.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.867
-You wanna give me a hand?
-Sure.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.677
What's the matter?

18:04.083 --> 18:07.314
I don't know.
It's like I've lost all my strength.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.586
Why don't you give it one more try.

19:16.188 --> 19:17.917
Mr. Kent.

19:18.357 --> 19:20.917
You wanna tell me how your tractor
wound up scattered...

19:21.093 --> 19:24.187
-...over two lanes of county blacktop?
-Yeah.

19:24.363 --> 19:28.356
We were pulling up to the farm, and we saw
somebody had put it on a flatbed.

19:28.534 --> 19:31.867
-So you're saying someone was stealing it?
-I tried to follow them.

19:32.037 --> 19:34.301
By the time I got here,
it must've fallen off.

19:34.473 --> 19:36.532
I'm telling you, it fell out of the sky.

19:37.776 --> 19:42.145
And last night, you were begging the nurses
to keep the flying monkeys out of your room.

19:42.314 --> 19:45.249
Kid, you're saying you had nothing
to do with this?

19:45.717 --> 19:48.584
To be honest, sheriff,
I'm not sure what happened.

19:49.454 --> 19:51.752
Well, he's hiding something, chief.

19:52.791 --> 19:54.383
Mr. White.

19:56.361 --> 19:58.659
There's another bus in about an hour.

19:58.830 --> 20:03.233
I suggest you catch it.
And don't call me "chief."

20:07.906 --> 20:10.374
I'm really sorry about the tractor.
It's a total loss.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.510
Clark, I'm not concerned
about the tractor.

20:12.678 --> 20:14.646
Whatever's going on with your abilities...

20:14.813 --> 20:18.544
...our family's wound up smack dab
in the middle of Perry White's radar.

20:29.361 --> 20:30.953
Wise decision coming inside.

20:31.129 --> 20:35.498
Weather service expects a shower of
threshing machines followed by combines.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.862
Guess I deserve that.

20:39.338 --> 20:42.796
If you tell me what you're looking for,
I'm sure I could help you find it.

20:43.275 --> 20:45.038
Now, why would you wanna do that?

20:45.577 --> 20:49.308
Because you were once the kind
of reporter that I would like to be.

20:50.882 --> 20:54.249
Though I'm curious how one goes
from multiple Pulitzer nominations...

20:54.419 --> 20:56.614
...to walking the Bigfoot beat.

20:56.788 --> 21:00.485
You know the thing that's worse than
never landing that story of a lifetime?

21:00.659 --> 21:02.820
-What?
-Having it...

21:02.995 --> 21:04.963
...and being afraid to write it.

21:06.732 --> 21:10.224
Perry "The Pit Bull" White
backing off a story?

21:10.402 --> 21:11.835
That's hard to believe.

21:12.004 --> 21:14.973
Well, Lionel Luthor can be
remarkably persuasive.

21:18.844 --> 21:22.371
Are you saying he had something
to do with your career slide?

21:23.882 --> 21:27.818
Let's just say that not everyone respects
good investigative journalism...

21:27.986 --> 21:31.888
...especially when it treads on the toes
of the rich and vengeful.

21:36.728 --> 21:38.559
Isn't that the Kent farm?

21:39.765 --> 21:41.528
Good eye.

21:41.900 --> 21:46.735
The police chalked it up to hyperactive
frat boys going crop circles on the barn.

21:47.806 --> 21:49.103
Why?

21:49.975 --> 21:52.307
Call it professional interest.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.411
Your friend Clark intrigues me.

22:04.056 --> 22:07.321
You've thrown some Hail Marys,
but to think your problems have to do...

22:07.492 --> 22:09.426
...with a solar flare? It's a stretch.

22:09.594 --> 22:13.223
I know, Dad, but my powers started
to glitch when the comet impacted.

22:13.398 --> 22:16.367
-Maybe there's a connection.
-Make that "probably."

22:16.535 --> 22:17.900
-Did you find something?
-Yes.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.436
Yesterday's cosmic fender-bender...

22:20.605 --> 22:22.869
...produced the largest solar flare
ever recorded.

22:23.041 --> 22:25.771
I'm talking communication glitches,
power surges--

22:25.944 --> 22:27.536
That's what's been happening to me.

22:27.713 --> 22:30.273
One second I'm helpless,
and the next, I'm in overdrive.

22:30.449 --> 22:33.907
Well, we always have wondered
about the source of your abilities.

22:34.553 --> 22:39.047
Maybe my strength and my speed, all the
things I can do, they come from the sun.

22:39.224 --> 22:41.954
It's like you're some sort of walking
solar battery.

22:42.127 --> 22:45.995
According to this, the effects of the solar
flare ought to be done by tomorrow night.

22:46.164 --> 22:47.995
Maybe your accidents are gonna stop.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.734
As long as I don't use my abilities till then,
we should be okay?

22:53.872 --> 22:56.602
Hey, Clark. I thought I'd give you
a heads-up.

22:56.775 --> 23:00.677
-Our resident ghostbuster is still on the job.
-Perry White?

23:02.247 --> 23:05.739
-I thought he went back to Metropolis.
-Evidently, he had a change of heart.

23:05.917 --> 23:09.546
And he seems to be especially
interested in you, Clark.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.082
What the hell are you trying to do?

23:15.260 --> 23:17.660
-Lex, calm down.
-Why?

23:17.829 --> 23:20.354
You've already made up your mind
about my mental state.

23:20.532 --> 23:23.660
You're refusing to sign off
on my psychological release.

23:23.835 --> 23:28.033
You're recommending even more sessions
to be continued on an indefinite basis?

23:28.206 --> 23:32.108
I have an ethical obligation
to report my conclusions honestly.

23:32.277 --> 23:35.644
Or maybe the nothing shrink
from Metropolis wanted more face time...

23:35.814 --> 23:39.113
...with her celebrity patient.
You must be loving this.

23:39.284 --> 23:41.275
I took no pleasure in my recommendation.

23:41.453 --> 23:44.889
-Then how do you explain it?
-I think you need help, Lex.

23:45.223 --> 23:49.353
Between the island, your failed marriage
and everything that's happened since...

23:49.528 --> 23:53.965
...you have experienced incredible
emotional and physical trauma.

23:54.132 --> 23:56.362
And your prescription's
more time on the couch?

23:56.535 --> 23:59.197
We just spent five sessions
exploring my psyche.

23:59.371 --> 24:02.363
No, we spent five hours discussing
your art collection...

24:02.541 --> 24:04.509
...your fascination with expensive cars...

24:04.676 --> 24:09.272
...everything except the most
traumatic moments of your life.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.576
Lex, if you don't let your demons out,
they could consume you.

24:12.751 --> 24:16.312
-We've been over this, doctor.
-We haven't even scratched the surface.

24:16.488 --> 24:19.048
This control-freak thing
might fool your father...

24:19.224 --> 24:22.318
...but did you really think
you could snow me?

24:22.494 --> 24:24.655
-Lex, please--
-Get out.

24:24.896 --> 24:26.864
Get out!

24:39.678 --> 24:41.839
Morning, Clark.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.306
-What are you doing here?
-You inspired me.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.078
If you've got a gift,
you should use it, remember?

24:48.253 --> 24:50.050
-You're drunk.
-Maybe.

24:50.222 --> 24:53.953
Nonetheless, I finally found my story.

24:55.527 --> 24:57.461
For some insane reason, it's me.

24:57.629 --> 25:00.325
-Chloe told me. I don't think it's funny.
-It's not a joke.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.865
I got the facts to back it up.

25:03.034 --> 25:06.231
-What kind of facts are those?
-The accident, the power lines...

25:06.404 --> 25:09.771
...your magical appearance as your
family's tractor drops out of the sky.

25:09.941 --> 25:13.274
-I explained that.
-"lt fell off a truck."

25:13.445 --> 25:16.437
That's not an explanation,
that's a punch line.

25:16.615 --> 25:21.279
I spent the morning combing through
police records and newspaper stories.

25:21.453 --> 25:25.787
You're Johnny-on-the-spot, Clark.
You're Smallville's own hero on deck.

25:25.957 --> 25:28.926
Trust me, Mr. White,
there's nothing special about me.

25:29.094 --> 25:30.789
Oh, that's where you're wrong, kid.

25:30.962 --> 25:35.058
So far, I got you pegged as really strong
and shock-resistant.

25:35.233 --> 25:38.066
Question is, what other tricks
have you got up your sleeve?

25:38.603 --> 25:42.004
Clark! Clark, could you give me a hand?

25:42.173 --> 25:44.198
I've gotta go.

25:44.442 --> 25:47.741
I've been stonewalled
by the best of them!

25:50.181 --> 25:51.739
You can run, but you...

25:56.788 --> 25:59.018
...can't hide.

26:14.039 --> 26:16.371
-Clark, you all right, son?
-It's been a weird day.

26:16.541 --> 26:20.477
-My light-speed gave out around Lake Tahoe.
-That's gotta be 1 000 miles.

26:20.645 --> 26:24.206
I know. One second I'm racing across
the country, the next, I can barely jog.

26:24.382 --> 26:28.182
I tried to make it home, my super-speed
gave out again around Colorado Springs.

26:28.353 --> 26:30.344
I barely had enough money
for a bus ticket.

26:30.522 --> 26:33.218
This thing's getting
way out of control, Clark.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.820
Don't worry. I'm glued to the couch
until this solar flare passes.

26:38.997 --> 26:41.488
I'm afraid it's not gonna be
that easy, son.

26:41.666 --> 26:44.396
Perry White saw you disappear.

26:44.569 --> 26:48.562
Now, your mother got him off the farm,
but I don't think he's gonna give up.

26:50.542 --> 26:53.067
Not that easy, anyway.

26:58.483 --> 27:01.509
When they told me you were at the gate,
I could hardly believe it.

27:01.686 --> 27:04.018
Yeah, you and me both.

27:04.189 --> 27:07.249
-I just thought we should talk.
-We have nothing to talk about.

27:07.425 --> 27:10.622
Oh, sorry to hear that.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.889
Now I guess you'll never find out
what I have on your father.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.301
If it's personal, I don't care.

27:17.469 --> 27:21.235
If it's legal, the statute of limitations
must've passed long ago.

27:21.406 --> 27:23.670
That depends.

27:25.977 --> 27:28.946
If this information is so damning...

27:29.114 --> 27:32.277
...why did my father stop at simply
destroying your career?

27:33.218 --> 27:38.121
Multiple copies plus multiple attorneys
all with, in the event of my death...

27:38.289 --> 27:41.349
...instructions to disseminate--
Well, you do the math.

27:42.761 --> 27:44.752
It's all yours.

27:45.096 --> 27:46.791
I just want one thing in return.

27:46.965 --> 27:50.958
-What did you have in mind?
-Everything you know about Clark Kent.

27:52.103 --> 27:55.470
-Clark?
-Yeah.

27:55.640 --> 27:59.098
Two years ago, you drove
your Porsche off a bridge.

27:59.277 --> 28:00.642
I went over the police photos.

28:00.812 --> 28:03.076
There's no way you could've
survived that crash...

28:03.248 --> 28:06.149
...without the miracle that is Clark Kent.

28:06.718 --> 28:11.678
Imagine my surprise when I discovered you'd
actually cultivated a friendship with this kid.

28:12.057 --> 28:14.116
So now you're going after Clark.

28:14.292 --> 28:16.783
This is a new low, even for you.

28:16.961 --> 28:20.419
The Lex I knew wouldn't shake your hand
without an ulterior motive.

28:20.598 --> 28:22.327
You must have something.

28:22.500 --> 28:25.367
Give it to me,
and I'll deliver you a story...

28:25.537 --> 28:29.871
...that'll bring new meaning to the phrase,
"sins of the father."

28:31.943 --> 28:34.776
You may have been able to neutralize
my father, but not me!

28:34.946 --> 28:37.779
-Looks like the jungle living took a toll.
-I'm warning you...

28:37.949 --> 28:40.679
...stay away from me
and stay away from my friends.

28:40.852 --> 28:43.082
Trust me, there won't be
any blood on my hands...

28:43.254 --> 28:45.814
...when they find what's left of you.

29:06.878 --> 29:09.312
Clark, I never thought you'd rate
your own paparazzi.

29:09.848 --> 29:13.409
Perry White must've called in a million
favors to get a camera crew.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.281
Yeah. Well, the good news is,
there's only one.

29:16.788 --> 29:18.881
If this solar-flare theory's correct, then...

29:19.057 --> 29:22.356
...your tractor-tossing days
will be over by tonight.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.660
I don't believe this.

29:28.333 --> 29:31.928
I can't believe this. I mean,
I feel like a prisoner in my own house.

29:32.103 --> 29:33.866
I just....

29:35.173 --> 29:36.834
Clark?

29:37.809 --> 29:39.504
Pete, get down!

29:45.950 --> 29:47.941
-Mom, Dad.
-Clark, wait.

29:48.119 --> 29:50.747
-Jonathan, hurry.
-Son.

29:52.891 --> 29:54.415
Clark, get back.

30:00.265 --> 30:01.664
Clark.

30:03.034 --> 30:05.400
-What's wrong with your hand?
-I burned it.

30:05.570 --> 30:07.060
My powers, they're gone again.

30:07.238 --> 30:09.638
Remember, all you have to do
is get through today.

30:09.808 --> 30:13.938
And hope that I don't get another
solar-flare burst and burn the farm down.

30:14.145 --> 30:16.010
Next time, I could hurt you or Mom.

30:16.181 --> 30:19.116
And Perry White will be there
to catch the whole thing on tape.

30:22.020 --> 30:24.215
Dad, I can't stay here.

30:34.199 --> 30:36.099
Clark!

30:36.634 --> 30:38.295
Clark, come back!

30:42.607 --> 30:46.475
He's running. Come on. Let's go.

31:08.199 --> 31:10.997
Keep it rolling! I want it all on tape.

31:14.138 --> 31:18.802
Clark is not here. And he's not coming back
until you people are gone.

31:18.977 --> 31:21.775
So why don't you just leave
my family alone.

31:31.823 --> 31:35.418
-Come on, Clark. They're long gone.
-Thanks for doing all this, Pete.

31:35.593 --> 31:38.323
You know I'm always up
for a little Undercover Brother.

31:38.496 --> 31:42.557
So we'll camp out tonight, check in
with your parents in the morning.

31:53.211 --> 31:57.807
"We reserve the right to refuse service
to anyone."

31:58.182 --> 32:00.878
I think you'd be more comfortable
at the Wild Coyote.

32:01.052 --> 32:03.850
Well, I was, until they threw me out.

32:04.722 --> 32:07.384
Either way, I'd like you to leave.

32:08.126 --> 32:10.560
Please, Miss Lang--

32:13.264 --> 32:18.668
Sometimes I let my enthusiasm for a story
outweigh my good sense.

32:19.537 --> 32:21.698
Is that your idea of an apology?

32:21.873 --> 32:26.207
No, look. Okay. Okay, I'm a jerk.

32:26.377 --> 32:30.541
And I've got the broken engagements
and the sleepless nights to prove it.

32:31.249 --> 32:35.379
If your job bothers you so much,
why don't you stop?

32:36.454 --> 32:38.854
Because I'm a journalist.

32:39.090 --> 32:41.183
It's in my blood.

32:41.693 --> 32:44.753
And sometimes you have to push
to get the truth...

32:44.929 --> 32:47.193
...even when it hurts.

32:49.534 --> 32:54.062
Well, if you're finished,
I'm gonna call you a cab.

32:54.238 --> 32:56.206
It won't come.

32:56.407 --> 32:59.467
It's a little issue
over nonpayment of fares.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.839
-But I'll make you a deal.
-Mr. White--

33:02.013 --> 33:05.449
I will trade permanently staying
out of your life...

33:05.616 --> 33:07.345
...for a ride to the bus stop.

33:09.854 --> 33:11.719
Let me get my coat.

33:25.303 --> 33:26.861
Hello.

33:27.038 --> 33:28.665
Lana?

33:28.973 --> 33:32.636
What? No, don't do anything.
I'll be right there.

33:32.810 --> 33:36.610
-Clark, what's going on?
-I gotta get to Saunders Gorge right now.

33:41.419 --> 33:43.512
Your speed thing still out?

33:43.888 --> 33:45.753
I got nothing, Pete. It's all gone.

33:46.524 --> 33:47.991
Get in. I'll drive.

34:04.976 --> 34:08.639
-Lana, you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine, but....

34:09.679 --> 34:12.581
I was driving him to the bus stop,
and he pretended to be sick.

34:12.750 --> 34:16.150
I pulled over, and he ran out to the
viewpoint and got out on the ledge...

34:16.320 --> 34:19.380
...and said he would kill himself
unless I called you.

34:23.895 --> 34:27.295
Look, Clark, be careful. He's really drunk.

34:28.399 --> 34:30.629
Not unless iced tea packs a punch.

34:32.469 --> 34:36.304
I knew you'd never show for me,
so I had to trick Lana into making the call.

34:36.474 --> 34:39.500
-Mr. White, don't do this.
-See, the way I figure it...

34:39.677 --> 34:43.806
...you're strong, you're shockproof,
and you're incredibly fast.

34:44.282 --> 34:46.512
Plus, you're cursed
with this hero complex.

34:46.684 --> 34:50.313
Yeah, why don't you come back down
on the deck, and we'll talk about that.

34:51.155 --> 34:54.681
-Not until I have my story.
-Wait, Mr. White.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.359
Look, you're wrong about me.

34:57.728 --> 35:00.390
-I'm betting you'll save me, Clark.
-No, I can't save you!

35:00.898 --> 35:04.527
Well, I guess we'll find out, huh?

35:22.854 --> 35:27.382
Okay, fun's over. Time to unleash
those incredible powers there, Clark.

35:27.725 --> 35:29.886
I don't have any powers!

35:39.170 --> 35:42.298
Pete! The camping gear,
there should be a rope!

35:42.473 --> 35:44.270
Okay.

35:44.442 --> 35:47.570
-Hold on, Mr. White!
-Hurry!

35:49.647 --> 35:51.080
Kid.

35:52.383 --> 35:54.851
Pete, it's not gonna hold!

35:55.753 --> 35:57.516
Come on!

36:09.300 --> 36:11.860
-Grab the rope!
-Hang on, kid.

36:22.446 --> 36:25.745
-Hold on!
-Hang on, kid.

36:27.885 --> 36:30.012
Go!

36:38.029 --> 36:40.827
Good! Keep going!

36:44.302 --> 36:45.997
Come on!

36:46.971 --> 36:48.563
Kid.

36:49.140 --> 36:50.903
-Okay?
-Yeah. Hurry.

36:51.075 --> 36:52.940
-All right.
-I can't hold on much longer.

36:53.110 --> 36:55.408
Pete, get moving!

37:16.534 --> 37:18.934
Here, give me your hand.

37:32.583 --> 37:34.608
Oh, Clark.

37:54.639 --> 37:57.904
I'm sure you understand the need
for confidentiality.

37:58.075 --> 38:01.442
I will be revealing things that are
deeply personal, even hurtful.

38:01.612 --> 38:05.309
That's the point of therapy, Lex.
To regain control...

38:05.483 --> 38:09.579
...Iet the bad feelings go and start
recovering from the traumas of the past.

38:09.754 --> 38:13.656
Then tomorrow. 1 0 a.m.

38:27.538 --> 38:30.735
-Clark, breakfast is almost ready.
-Great. I'll be done in a second.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.633
So you're sure everything's okay now?

38:38.416 --> 38:41.408
Once the effects of the flare faded,
things went back to normal.

38:41.585 --> 38:44.053
Including your sense of humor.

38:46.090 --> 38:49.218
-Hi, Lana. This is a surprise.
-Hi, Mrs. Kent.

38:49.393 --> 38:52.157
-I hope I didn't come at a bad time.
-No, not at all.

38:52.330 --> 38:56.096
-Clark, I'll keep a plate warm for you.
-Bye.

38:59.437 --> 39:00.870
Hey, Lana.

39:01.038 --> 39:03.131
You know, I was gonna stop
by the Talon later.

39:03.307 --> 39:07.767
Just, with all the craziness,
I didn't get a chance to thank you.

39:08.079 --> 39:10.309
I still don't understand
why Mr. White thought...

39:10.481 --> 39:13.712
...you could do all those incredible things.

39:13.884 --> 39:16.785
But I'm glad I was able to help.

39:16.954 --> 39:19.889
You know, I wasn't just talking
about the gorge.

39:20.257 --> 39:23.090
Whether I meant to or not,
I helped dredge up your memories...

39:23.294 --> 39:25.228
...about the meteor shower.

39:25.396 --> 39:28.229
I wanted to thank you for forgiving me.

39:29.433 --> 39:32.664
Well, that's part of the reason
why I came by.

39:33.137 --> 39:35.401
I went to the graveyard this morning.

39:35.973 --> 39:38.601
Bet your parents were happy to see you.

39:41.512 --> 39:45.073
Suddenly, I realized I hadn't been there
for months.

39:45.616 --> 39:47.140
At first, I felt guilty.

39:47.318 --> 39:50.219
You know, like I had done
something wrong.

39:50.554 --> 39:56.754
But then I realized that that is the last
thing they would have ever wanted for me.

39:58.195 --> 40:01.790
-So, what did you tell them?
-The truth.

40:03.067 --> 40:05.968
That I never meant to ignore them.

40:06.137 --> 40:07.798
But...

40:08.305 --> 40:11.399
...there's someone else in my life now.

40:11.575 --> 40:13.668
Someone I really care about.

40:13.844 --> 40:16.244
-Lana--
-Clark.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.245
It's okay.

40:20.384 --> 40:25.117
I also told them that we were
in a kind of strange place right now.

40:25.890 --> 40:28.723
But I'm still hoping
that we can work it out.

40:32.363 --> 40:34.957
The important thing is...

40:36.000 --> 40:39.629
...they know they will always be
in my thoughts.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.266
I better go.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.218
Thanks again for the ride.

41:29.386 --> 41:32.355
It's the only way I could be sure
you'd get on the bus.

41:33.524 --> 41:35.082
What?

41:35.326 --> 41:38.124
You really are kind of a freak,
you know that?

41:38.562 --> 41:42.123
-Mr. White.
-I'm serious.

41:42.299 --> 41:44.859
You try to help people,
even fools like me...

41:45.035 --> 41:47.731
...and you never ask for anything
in return.

41:47.905 --> 41:50.373
When I saw your face up there
after it was all over...

41:50.541 --> 41:54.272
...I suddenly realized I was about
to tear down a good person.

41:54.445 --> 41:59.075
I just couldn't believe there was
actually anyone like you out there.

41:59.316 --> 42:01.375
Trust me, Mr. White, I'm not that good.

42:01.552 --> 42:05.420
Well, I'm just glad nobody got hurt.

42:05.589 --> 42:09.320
Chalk it up to hallucinations or the D.T.'s.

42:09.493 --> 42:11.984
All I know is, I got a wake-up call.

42:12.162 --> 42:17.566
I am exactly 1 7 hours
and five minutes sober.

42:18.302 --> 42:21.169
Well, I'm glad some good came
out of all this.

42:22.640 --> 42:26.303
-So, what's next?
-lf you found the guts to go over that cliff...

42:26.477 --> 42:30.208
...maybe I can find the courage
to finish the one story I let go.

42:30.748 --> 42:33.478
Something tells me we haven't
seen the last of Perry White.

42:33.651 --> 42:35.881
Something tells me you're right.

42:36.387 --> 42:39.948
Rumor has it, I still have a friend or two
on the Daily Planet.

42:41.225 --> 42:45.958
Oh, by the way, I went over a couple more
of your Torch stories.

42:46.697 --> 42:48.460
And?

42:48.632 --> 42:51.658
Well, they're rough, and half the time,
you bury the lead.

42:51.835 --> 42:53.996
But I see a glimmer of hope.

42:54.171 --> 42:57.436
If you ever make it to Metropolis,
look me up. I owe you one.
