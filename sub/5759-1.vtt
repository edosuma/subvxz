WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:03.067
CHEERS!
(woman) I'M GOING
TO TELL YOU A STORY

00:03.100 --> 00:05.193
THAT DOESN'T HAVE
A HAPPY ENDING.

00:05.230 --> 00:07.289
IT'S ABOUT FIVE PRETTY GIRLS

00:07.340 --> 00:08.762
IN THE PERFECT TOWN
OF ROSEWOOD.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.769
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?
WE'LL BE FRIENDS FOREVER.

00:11.810 --> 00:13.471
THEY WERE
THE BEST OF FRIENDS...

00:13.510 --> 00:14.636
YOU GUYS PASSED THE TEST.

00:14.680 --> 00:17.342
AND BEST FRIENDS SHARE SECRETS.

00:17.380 --> 00:19.746
IF THEY ASK ABOUT IT,
YOU HAVE TO LIE.

00:19.780 --> 00:21.145
(thunderclap)
ONE NIGHT...

00:21.180 --> 00:22.181
WHERE'S ALI?

00:22.220 --> 00:23.812
THE FAIREST OF THEM ALL
DISAPPEARED.

00:23.850 --> 00:25.442
I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE
FOR HER.

00:25.490 --> 00:27.651
I THINK I HEARD HER SCREAM.

00:27.690 --> 00:29.419
(cell phone alerts chime)
AND THEN THERE WERE FOUR.

00:30.660 --> 00:32.548
AREN'T YOU GONNA GET THAT?

00:32.600 --> 00:34.249
THE MYSTERY REMAINED
UNSOLVED...

00:34.300 --> 00:36.097
LOOK, WE'VE TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING THAT WE KNOW,

00:36.130 --> 00:37.666
JUST LIKE WE DID
THE NIGHT SHE WENT MISSING.

00:37.700 --> 00:40.339
BUT THE REAL TROUBLE
WAS ONLY BEGINNING.

00:40.370 --> 00:42.634
AAH!
"SHE KNEW TOO MUCH. --A."

00:42.670 --> 00:44.308
WHAT HAS "A" DONE TO YOU?
(gaSPS)

00:44.340 --> 00:47.434
IT'S HER! DON'T YOU GET IT?!
SHE'S EVERYWHERE.

00:48.810 --> 00:50.141
THERE WERE NEW SECRETS
TO KEEP.

00:50.180 --> 00:51.272
WE MADE A PROMISE.

00:51.310 --> 00:53.778
THE PRE'ITY GIRLS TOLD
SOME UGLY LIES...

00:53.820 --> 00:55.310
(automated girl's voice)
I'M TAKING YOU TO HER.

00:55.350 --> 00:56.442
GO ALONE.

00:58.650 --> 01:00.515
HANNA!
(engine revs)

01:00.560 --> 01:03.279
(thud)

01:03.330 --> 01:06.390
NOW THEY'RE IN DEEPER
THAN THEY EVER IMAGINED.

01:06.430 --> 01:08.489
SOMEONE WAS IN HERE.
PLEASE!

01:08.530 --> 01:10.293
(gaSPS)
AND WITH NOWHERE TO TURN...

01:10.330 --> 01:11.592
(Alison) IF YOU EVER
COME BACK TO ROSEWOOD...

01:11.630 --> 01:13.495
(fire whooshes)
I'LL BURY YOU.

01:13.540 --> 01:15.167
THERE'S JUST ONE QUESTION
TO ASK.
(screams)

01:15.200 --> 01:16.303
"YOU'RE MINE NOW."
(hatch squeaks)

01:16.340 --> 01:18.160
HOW DID WE GET HERE?

01:18.210 --> 01:21.179
(cell phones ringing)

01:21.210 --> 01:22.848
**

01:22.880 --> 01:25.849
-- Captions by VITA --

01:25.880 --> 01:28.747
OH, MY GOD. IS IT TRUE?

01:28.780 --> 01:30.179
WAIT. WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL US?

01:30.220 --> 01:31.482
TELL US WHAT?

01:31.520 --> 01:33.112
(indistinct conversations)

01:33.160 --> 01:34.388
HI, YOU GUYS!

01:34.420 --> 01:37.218
IF YOU IGNORE IT,
IT WILL GO AWAY.

01:37.260 --> 01:39.592
(Mona) AH, CLASSIC ALISON.

01:39.630 --> 01:40.619
THAT'S ME.

01:40.660 --> 01:42.764
THEY USED TO CALL ME
"LOSER MONA,"

01:42.800 --> 01:45.724
AND I'VE KNOWN THESE GIRLS
FOR A LONG TIME.

01:45.770 --> 01:48.432
**

01:48.470 --> 01:52.133
ALISON DiLAURENTIS WAS
THE QUEEN BEE OF ROSEWOOD HIGH

01:52.180 --> 01:54.705
AND RULED THE SCHOOL
WITH A VELVET FIST.

01:54.740 --> 01:57.379
SHE WAS THE KIND OF GIRL
WHO BOYS WANTED TO BE WITH

01:57.410 --> 01:58.741
AND GIRLS WANTED TO BE.

01:58.780 --> 02:00.611
DON'T RUIN A PERFECT DAY,
SPENCER.

02:00.650 --> 02:02.880
SHE KNEW
WHAT EVERYONE WAS HIDING

02:02.920 --> 02:05.548
AND WASN'T SHY ABOUT
USING IT AGAINST THEM.

02:05.590 --> 02:06.852
ARE YOU REALLY GONNA EAT THAT,
SWEETIE?

02:06.890 --> 02:09.188
I'M BEING A FRIEND, HANNA.

02:09.230 --> 02:12.324
"HEFI'Y" HANNA MARIN
STUFFED HER FEELINGS WITH PIE

02:12.360 --> 02:13.497
WHEN HER PARENTS BROKE UP.

02:13.530 --> 02:14.622
(sniffles)

02:14.660 --> 02:16.491
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL
THIS WAY.

02:16.530 --> 02:18.794
I CAN SHOW YOU HOW
TO GET RID OF IT.

02:18.830 --> 02:22.505
EMILY FIELDS WAS A SWEETHEART
AND A STAR SWIMMER

02:22.540 --> 02:24.531
WITH A SECRET CRUSH ON ALISON.

02:24.570 --> 02:27.232
JUST BECAUSE WE KISSED
IN THE LIBRARY, EMILY,

02:27.280 --> 02:28.577
DOESN'T MEAN
I'M INTO YOU LIKE THAT.

02:28.610 --> 02:31.374
I LIKE BOYS. AND TRUST ME,
IF I'M KISSING YOU,

02:31.410 --> 02:33.640
IT'S BECAUSE IT'S PRACTICE
FOR THE REAL THING.

02:35.620 --> 02:38.544
ARIA MONTGOMERY DIDN'T HAVE
A CARE IN THE WORLD...

02:38.590 --> 02:40.251
ISN'T THAT YOUR DAD'S CAR?

02:40.290 --> 02:41.757
UNTIL THE DAY SHE SAW
HER FATHER GIVING

02:41.790 --> 02:45.328
ONE OF HIS STUDENTS
A HANDS-ON EDUCATION.

02:45.360 --> 02:46.292
ARIA, YOU JUST SAW YOUR DAD

02:46.330 --> 02:47.627
MAKING OUT WITH SOMEONE
WHO IS NOT YOUR MOM.

02:47.660 --> 02:50.561
YOU--YOU HAVE TO TELL HER.
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO TELL HER THAT?

02:50.600 --> 02:53.933
I DON'T KNOW, BUT YOU HAVE TO,
BEFORE SOMEBODY ELSE DOES.

02:55.600 --> 02:58.808
SPENCER HASTINGS CAME FROM
A LONG LINE OF OVERACHIEVERS

02:58.840 --> 03:01.331
AND ALWAYS FELT LIKE
A SECOND-CLASS CITIZEN.

03:01.380 --> 03:03.940
BUT IT TURNS OUT
LIVING IN YOUR SISTER'S SHADOW

03:03.980 --> 03:05.641
HAS ITS PERKS.
LIKE THIS.

03:05.680 --> 03:08.342
OKAY, RIGHT THERE.
MM-HMM.

03:08.380 --> 03:11.508
WHEN MELISSA'S BOYFRIEND IAN
PUT THE MOVES ON SPENCER,

03:11.550 --> 03:13.689
GUESS WHO SAW EVERYTHING.

03:13.720 --> 03:15.688
IT LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE
INTO IT.
WELL, I WASN'T.

03:15.720 --> 03:20.498
I HOPE NOT. BECAUSE IF YOU WERE,
THAT WOULD MAKE YOU A SKANK.

03:20.530 --> 03:23.522
(thunderclap)

03:23.570 --> 03:24.696
(thunder rumbling)

03:24.730 --> 03:25.799
(laughs)
IT'S BAD, HUH?

03:25.830 --> 03:28.663
IT STARTED OUT LIKE
ANY OTHER NIGHT...

03:28.700 --> 03:29.837
(whispers)
SOMETHING'S OUT THERE.

03:29.870 --> 03:31.701
(door creaks)
(whispers) GUYS.

03:31.740 --> 03:33.571
BEST FRIENDS HAVING
A SLEEPOVER...

03:33.610 --> 03:34.702
GOTCHA!
(girls scream)

03:34.740 --> 03:36.276
PLAYING TRICKS...

03:36.310 --> 03:38.505
SO NOT FUNNY, ALISON.
(speaks indistinctly)

03:38.550 --> 03:40.313
JUST GIRLS BEING GIRLS.

03:40.350 --> 03:41.442
ALI, DID YOU DOWNLOAD
THE NEW BEYONC?

03:41.480 --> 03:43.380
OH, NOT YET.

03:43.420 --> 03:44.614
I'M LOVING HER NEW VIDEO.

03:44.650 --> 03:45.981
MAYBE A LITTLE TOO MUCH, EM.

03:46.020 --> 03:47.749
(Alison giggles)

03:47.790 --> 03:50.486
YOUR TURN. COME ON.

03:50.530 --> 03:51.929
CAREFUL, ARIA.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.793
TAKE TOO MUCH, AND YOU'LL
TELL US ALL YOUR SECRETS.
(gIrls laugh)

03:54.830 --> 03:56.593
FRIENDS SHARE SECRETS.

03:56.630 --> 03:59.337
THAT'S WHAT KEEPS US CLOSE.

03:59.370 --> 04:01.031
DRINK UP.

04:01.070 --> 04:04.506
AFTER A NIGHT OF FUN,
THEY FINALLY FELL ASLEEP.

04:04.540 --> 04:07.600
AND WHEN THEY WOKE UP,
ALI WAS GONE.

04:07.640 --> 04:10.700
ALI?
I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE
FOR HER.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.547
I THINK I HEARD HER SCREAM.

04:14.780 --> 04:16.338
**

04:16.390 --> 04:17.482
(thunderclap)

04:17.520 --> 04:21.889
A YEAR LATER,
ALISON WAS STILL MISSING.

04:21.920 --> 04:24.559
LIFE IN ROSEWOOD WAS SLOWLY
GE'I'I'ING BACK TO NORMAL...

04:24.590 --> 04:26.899
DID YOU SEE THE PAPER TODAY?

04:26.930 --> 04:28.022
YEAH.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.426
SHE'S GONE,
BUT SHE'S EVERYWHERE.

04:30.470 --> 04:31.721
AND I HAD A NEW B.F.F.

04:31.770 --> 04:34.898
WOW. TALK ABOUT
A MAKEOVER.

04:34.940 --> 04:36.362
"HEFI'Y HANNA" AND "LOSER MONA"

04:36.410 --> 04:39.004
WERE NOW THE MOST POPULAR GIRLS
IN SCHOOL.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.031
THE FIRST ONE'S
FOR MY BESTIE.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.379
AND ONE FOR EACH OF YOU,
MY BESTIE'S OTHER FRIENDS.

04:44.410 --> 04:45.445
I DITCHED THE GLASSES,

04:45.480 --> 04:47.414
AND HANNA REPLACED
HER LOVE OF SWEETS

04:47.450 --> 04:48.815
WITH A TASTE FOR SHOPLIFI'ING.

04:48.850 --> 04:51.489
NICE SCARF.
NICE GLASSES.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.408
WE MADE A GREAT TEAM.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.520
(doorbell rings)

04:56.560 --> 04:57.754
HAN NA MARIN?

04:57.790 --> 04:59.052
YEAH. WHY?

04:59.090 --> 05:01.092
IS YOUR MOTHER HOME?

05:01.130 --> 05:04.793
WE RECEIVED A CALL
FROM ROSEWOOD MALL SECURITY.

05:04.830 --> 05:06.798
COULD YOU TURN AROUND?
(handcuffs rattle)

05:06.840 --> 05:08.933
IN A TOWN LIKE ROSEWOOD,
THIS KIND OF SECRET

05:08.970 --> 05:12.599
COULD RUIN YOUR REPUTATION
IN ONE STROKE...
(cell phone alert chimes)

05:12.640 --> 05:15.905
AND SOMEONE ALREADY HAD
THE SCOOP.

05:21.980 --> 05:23.117
WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:23.150 --> 05:24.686
LET'S GO.
REALLY?

05:24.720 --> 05:26.950
INSTEAD OF PAYING
FOR HER CRIME,

05:26.990 --> 05:29.083
HANNA'S MOTHER ASHLEY
STEPPED IN,

05:29.120 --> 05:30.519
TAKING THE LAW
INTO HER OWN HANDS

05:30.560 --> 05:31.959
TO HAVE THE CHARGES DROPPED.

05:31.990 --> 05:33.423
I'M REALLY SORRY, MOM.

05:33.460 --> 05:34.654
FOR WHAT?

05:34.700 --> 05:35.894
THE COP.

05:35.930 --> 05:38.797
IT'S OVER. OKAY?

05:38.830 --> 05:40.661
YOU WON'T BE SEEING HIM
AGAIN.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.804
EMILY STILL WASN'T OUT
TO ANYONE,

05:42.840 --> 05:44.967
BUT WHEN A NEW GIRL NAMED MAYA
MOVED TO TOWN...

05:45.010 --> 05:47.831
YOU'RE... CRAZY BEAUTIFUL.

05:47.880 --> 05:51.976
SHE COULDN'T DENY HER FEELINGS
ANY LONGER.

05:52.010 --> 05:54.877
BUT HER SECRET WAS ALREADY OUT,

05:54.920 --> 05:58.811
BECAUSE SOMEONE KNEW
HER HEART'S DESIRE.

06:00.990 --> 06:05.029
JUST BEFORE SCHOOL STARTED,
ARIA MET EZRA.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.823
SO DO YOU GO TO HOLLIS?

06:06.860 --> 06:08.851
JUST GRADUATED.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.822
I'M GONNA START
MY FIRST TEACHING JOB.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.737
YEAH? I-I THINK I'D LIKE
TO TEACH.

06:13.770 --> 06:15.988
IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT...

06:16.040 --> 06:17.132
I'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE
ABOUT YOU.

06:17.170 --> 06:19.138
I'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE
ABOUT YOU, TOO.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.707
AND THERE WAS NO HOLDING BACK.

06:21.740 --> 06:24.072
BUT WHO WOULD'VE GUESSED THAT
THE BOY FROM SATURDAY NIGHT

06:24.110 --> 06:26.874
WOULD BE HER ENGLISH TEACHER
ON MONDAY MORNING?

06:26.920 --> 06:28.012
HOLY CRAP.

06:28.050 --> 06:29.586
HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF...

06:29.620 --> 06:31.110
(cell phone alert chimes)

06:31.150 --> 06:34.051
AND SOMEONE KNEW ARIA'S SECRET.

06:37.590 --> 06:39.899
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

06:39.930 --> 06:42.660
SPENCER'S SISTER MELISSA
BROUGHT HOME A FIANC.

06:42.700 --> 06:43.826
I'M WREN.

06:43.870 --> 06:47.590
AND "A" PREDICT ED WHERE
THINGS WERE HEADED.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.562
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT
YOU WERE INTO DESIGN.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.703
YEAH. I APPRECIATE BEAUTY.

06:55.810 --> 06:59.940
WHEN MELISSA SAW THEM TOGETHER,
THE WEDDING WAS OFF.

06:59.980 --> 07:03.541
FOR THE LAST TIME,
HE MADE THE MOVE ON ME!

07:03.590 --> 07:05.615
DON'T, SPENCER, PLEASE.
RIGHT, AND YOU JUST SAT THERE
LIKE A TH ROW PILLOW

07:05.650 --> 07:07.550
WITH YOUR TONGUE
DOWN HIS THROAT.

07:07.590 --> 07:10.525
THE MESSAGES FROM "A" COULD
ONLY MEAN ONE THING.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.027
(Aria) ALISON?

07:12.060 --> 07:13.152
THEY FOUND YOUR FRIEND.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.498
I KNEW SHE WAS BACK.
IS SHE INSIDE?

07:15.530 --> 07:18.567
EMILY...
THEY FOUND ALISON'S BODY.

07:21.570 --> 07:23.231
AND THAT'S WHEN
THESE LITTLE LIARS

07:23.270 --> 07:26.569
REALLY GOT SCARED...

07:26.610 --> 07:29.579
BECAUSE IF "A" DIDN'T STAND
FOR "ALI,"

07:29.610 --> 07:33.068
THEN SOMEONE ELSE KNEW
THEIR DIRTY LITTLE SECRETS.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.942
I HEARD THE COPS TOOK HANNA
TO THE POLICE STATION TODAY.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.719
YOU--YOU DON'T THINK
SHE'D EVER TALK ABOUT...

07:38.750 --> 07:41.617
THE JENNA THING?

07:41.660 --> 07:45.050
WE MADE A PROMISE.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.729
AND THAT'S
HOW THE GAME BEGAN.

07:51.230 --> 07:52.538
(bell tolling)

07:52.570 --> 07:54.094
CAN YOU BELIEVE
WHAT A SCENE THIS IS?

07:54.140 --> 07:56.506
ALISON WOULD'VE LOVED IT.

07:56.540 --> 07:59.771
POPULAR IN LIFE AND DEATH.

07:59.810 --> 08:02.108
THE WHOLE TOWN TURNED OUT
TO LAY ALISON TO REST.

08:02.140 --> 08:05.507
BUT THE PAST ISN'T ALWAYS
_SO_ EASILY BURIED.
(IndIstInct murmurIng)

08:05.550 --> 08:08.110
(whispers) OH, MY GOD.
IT'S JENNA.

08:08.150 --> 08:09.617
(murmuring continues)

08:09.650 --> 08:10.617
AND WHEN JENNA MARSHALL

08:10.650 --> 08:13.619
MADE A SURPRISE RETURN
TO ROSEWOOD...

08:15.020 --> 08:16.988
THE GIRLS REALIZED THEIR
TROUBLES WERE JUST BEGINNING.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.555
OH, MY GOD.
I GOT ONE, TOO.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.750
(gaSPS)
"I'M STILL HERE, BITCHES"...

08:21.800 --> 08:24.894
(all) "AND I KNOW EVERYTHING.
__Alll

08:24.930 --> 08:27.262
NONE OF THEIR SECRETS
WERE SAFE,

08:27.300 --> 08:28.289
AND THEIR WORST SECRET OF ALL

08:28.340 --> 08:30.729
WAS NOW STARING THEM
IN THE FACE--

08:30.770 --> 08:32.032
EVEN IF SHE COULDN'T SEE.

08:32.070 --> 08:34.106
WHEN DID YOU GET BACK,
JENNA?

08:34.140 --> 08:35.300
WE HEARD THAT YOU WERE
IN PHILADELPHIA

08:35.340 --> 08:38.104
AT A SCHOOL FOR
THE... VISUALLY IMPAIRED.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.072
YOU CAN SAY BLIND, SPENCER.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.269
IT'S OKAY.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.140
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.114
**

08:46.150 --> 08:49.586
JENNA IS THE STEPSISTER
OF TOBY CAVANAUGH.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.621
SHE MOVED TO ROSEWOOD
AS A FRESHMAN...

08:51.660 --> 08:53.890
I'M JENNA.
I'M ALISON.

08:53.930 --> 08:54.897
I KNOW.

08:54.930 --> 08:57.091
AND IMMEDIATELY MADE
AN IMPRESSION.

08:57.130 --> 09:00.293
I CAN MAKE IT REALLY EASY
FOR YOU TO FIT IN HERE.

09:00.340 --> 09:03.901
I REALLY APPRECIATE
THE OFFER...

09:03.940 --> 09:07.307
BUT I LIKE TO PICK
MY OWN FRIENDS.

09:07.340 --> 09:09.228
BAD MOVE, JENNA.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.645
WHEN YOU REJECT ALI...

09:10.680 --> 09:11.977
(fireworks exploding)

09:12.010 --> 09:13.875
YOU PLAY WITH FIRE.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.615
ARE WE SURE
HE'S NOT IN THERE?

09:15.650 --> 09:16.685
IT'S A STINK BOMB,
FOR GOD SAKES.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.915
WE'RE NOT NUKING THE PLACE.

09:18.950 --> 09:20.850
(firecracker hissing)

09:20.890 --> 09:22.016
(explosion)
(Jenna screams)

09:22.060 --> 09:23.322
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A HARMLESS PRANK...

09:23.360 --> 09:25.021
ALI, WHAT DID YOU DO?

09:25.060 --> 09:27.051
(siren wailing)
BUT JENNA WAS BLINDED,

09:27.100 --> 09:29.819
AND ALI BLACKMAILED TOBY
INTO TAKING THE BLAME.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.792
(indistinct conversations)

09:31.830 --> 09:33.366
(cell phone alert chiming)

09:33.400 --> 09:35.231
IF THE TRUTH EVER GOT OUT...

09:35.270 --> 09:37.101
AREN'T YOU GONNA GET THAT?

09:37.140 --> 09:39.973
THE GIRLS WOULD PAY THE PRICE,
AND THEY KNEW IT.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.002
BUT THE JENNA THING WASN'T
THEIR ONLY PROBLEM.

09:46.050 --> 09:50.146
AND WHEN YOU THREE WOKE UP
IN THE BARN, ALISON WAS GONE?

09:50.190 --> 09:52.078
NOW THAT ALISON'S BODY
HAD BEEN FOUND,

09:52.120 --> 09:55.089
THE POLICE WERE NO LONGER
INVESTIGATING A MISSING PERSON.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.656
THEY WERE INVESTIGATING
A MURDER.

09:56.690 --> 09:58.328
IS THAT HOW YOU REMEMBER IT,
HANNA?

09:58.360 --> 10:00.089
YEAH.

10:00.130 --> 10:01.825
LOOK, WE'VE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING
THAT WE KNOW,

10:01.860 --> 10:03.361
JUST LIKE WE DID
THE NIGHT SHE WENT MISSING.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.697
I KNOW. I KNOW.

10:04.730 --> 10:05.958
AND YOU SEE, THE THING IS,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.889
IT'S ALMOST EXACTLY WHAT
YOU SAID LAST YEAR.

10:08.940 --> 10:11.636
ALMOST LIKE IT WAS REHEARSED.

10:11.670 --> 10:13.706
DETECTIVE WILDEN WAS CONVINCED
THE GIRLS KNEW

10:13.740 --> 10:14.968
MORE THAN THEY WERE LETTING ON.

10:15.010 --> 10:16.329
ARE YOU SPYING ON ME?

10:16.380 --> 10:17.904
JUST DOING MY JOB.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.838
YOU SEE,
THE THING IS, HANNA,

10:19.880 --> 10:20.949
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU WERE DRINKING

10:20.980 --> 10:23.813
THE NIGHT
ALISON WENT MISSING.

10:23.850 --> 10:25.886
WHAT I CARE ABOUT IS YOU
AND YOUR PRETTY LITTLE FRIENDS

10:25.920 --> 10:27.148
KNOWING WHO KILLED HER.

10:27.190 --> 10:28.282
WHAT?

10:28.320 --> 10:29.457
YOUR MOM MAY BE HOT, HANNA,

10:29.490 --> 10:33.153
BUT SHE'S NOT HOT ENOUGH
TO MAKE THAT GO AWAY.

10:33.200 --> 10:37.125
SO THE GIRLS LAUNCHED
AN INVESTIGATION OF THEIR OWN,

10:37.170 --> 10:39.320
AND "A" GAVE THEM
THE LEAD THEY NEEDED.

10:39.370 --> 10:41.292
"ALISON LOVES IAN"?

10:42.810 --> 10:45.699
**

10:45.740 --> 10:49.847
IAN THOMAS WAS AN OLD FLAME
OF SPENCER'S SISTER MELISSA.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.404
HE STAYED THE NIGHT?

10:51.450 --> 10:54.146
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE STRANGERS.

10:54.180 --> 10:57.183
WE WENT OUT FOR TWO YEARS,
AND WE HAD A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

10:57.220 --> 10:59.142
HE WAS BACK IN ROSEWOOD...

10:59.190 --> 11:00.418
OH. HEY.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.951
AND SPENCER CONFRONTED HIM.

11:02.990 --> 11:04.082
YOU THINK
I HAD SOMETHING TO DO

11:04.130 --> 11:05.688
WITH WHAT HAPPENED
TO ALISON DiLAURENTIS?

11:05.730 --> 11:07.698
I DIDN'T, THOUGH I'M NOT
SURPRISED SHE ENDED UP THAT WAY.

11:07.730 --> 11:09.357
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

11:09.400 --> 11:11.766
YOU KNOW, IT MEANS
YOUR FRIEND ALISON WAS

11:11.800 --> 11:14.837
A PSYCHO STALKER WHO WOULDN'T
TAKE "NO" FOR AN ANSWER.

11:14.870 --> 11:16.394
OKAY? SOMEONE ELSE PROBABLY
HAD ENOUGH OF HER.

11:16.440 --> 11:19.000
DESPITE SPENCER'S OBJECT IONS,

11:19.040 --> 11:20.769
IAN WAS HERE TO STAY.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.107
WE'RE MARRIED.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.300
(Melissa and Ian laugh)

11:23.350 --> 11:26.103
YOU...
YOU'RE WHAT?

11:26.150 --> 11:27.447
WE ELOPED.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.345
SPENCER'S WORLD
WAS UPSIDE-DOWN,

11:29.380 --> 11:32.178
BUT SHE FOUND COMFORT
IN AN UNLIKELY NEW FRIEND.

11:32.220 --> 11:33.448
"GOOFBALL. "

11:33.490 --> 11:37.756
YOU CAN PUT DOWN 104 POINTS
FOR ME.

11:37.790 --> 11:40.122
TOBY CAVANAUGH WAS BACK
FROM REFORM SCHOOL.

11:40.160 --> 11:42.321
SO I GUESS
WE'RE LAB PARTNERS.

11:42.360 --> 11:43.918
YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

11:43.970 --> 11:46.393
HIS REPUTATION
MADE THE GIRLS NERVOUS,

11:46.430 --> 11:49.490
BUT HE AND SPENCER HAD
AN UNDENIABLE CONNECTION.

11:49.540 --> 11:52.976
LOOK, I'VE NEVER HAD
A SAFE PLACE TO LAND.

11:53.010 --> 11:55.103
I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU.

11:55.140 --> 11:58.109
I LOVE KNOWING THAT.

12:04.220 --> 12:06.780
HANNA HAD A THING
FOR BAD BOYS, TOO.

12:06.820 --> 12:10.483
SHE FOUND OUT CALEB RIVERS
WAS SLEEPING AT SCHOOL

12:10.530 --> 12:12.225
AND DECIDED
TO TAKE IN A STRAY.

12:12.260 --> 12:14.399
(Ashley) HANNA?
I'M IN THE SHOWER, MOM!

12:17.200 --> 12:20.363
WHAT IS WITH THIS CHARGER?

12:20.400 --> 12:21.890
I REALLY CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW,
MOM.

12:21.940 --> 12:23.498
I'M GETTING SHAMPOO
IN MY MOUTH.

12:23.540 --> 12:25.132
ALL RIGHT.
SEE YOU AT DINNER.

12:28.410 --> 12:31.345
AS HANNA AND CALEB GREW CLOSER,

12:31.380 --> 12:33.314
ARIA WAS HAVING
A DIFFICULT TIME

12:33.350 --> 12:35.739
DENYING HER FEELINGS
FOR EZRA FITZ.

12:38.420 --> 12:42.117
BUT THE MYSTERIOUS "A" KNEW
ALL ABOUT THEIR FORBIDDEN LOVE.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.186
WHO'S "A"?
I DON'T KNOW.

12:45.230 --> 12:47.027
HOW MANY OF YOUR FRIENDS
DID YOU TELL?
I DIDN'T.

12:47.060 --> 12:48.527
'CAUSE IF "A" KNOWS,
I'M THINKING "B" AND "C"

12:48.560 --> 12:49.458
AND EVERYBODY ELSE DOES, TOO.

12:49.500 --> 12:53.231
THE PERSON WHO SENT THIS
IS NOT MY FRIEND.

12:53.270 --> 12:55.989
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE
MATURE ENOUGH TO HANDLE THIS.

12:56.040 --> 12:57.530
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF THE SCHOOL BOARD

12:57.570 --> 12:59.128
OR--OR IF--IF ANYBODY--
I DIDN'T TELL ANYONE.

12:59.170 --> 13:01.070
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.
WELL, I DON'T.

13:01.110 --> 13:05.149
"A" HAD A WAY OF AFFECTING
EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR LIVES...

13:05.180 --> 13:06.818
"DON'T SAY I NEVER
GAVE YOU ANYTHING.

13:06.850 --> 13:08.545
TURN ON YOUORHCOMPUTER.

13:08.580 --> 13:11.981
INCLUDING THEIR INVESTIGATION
INTO ALI'S MURDER.

13:12.020 --> 13:14.580
(girls laughing)
(Aria) SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN
SPYING ON US FOR YEARS.

13:14.620 --> 13:17.259
AND ALI DIDN'T TAKE THE VIDEO.
SHE'S IN IT.

13:17.290 --> 13:19.429
SHE'S IN A LOT OF THEM.
OH, MY GOD.

13:19.460 --> 13:21.291
IF THE GIRLS KNEW
I WAS SEEING YOU?

13:21.330 --> 13:23.195
OH, MY GOD.
THEY'D NEVER SHUT UP ABOUT IT.

13:23.230 --> 13:25.221
(Spencer) THIS WAS THE NIGHT
THAT ALISON DISAPPEARED.

13:25.270 --> 13:27.431
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

13:27.470 --> 13:29.529
I HAVE TO GET BACK
BEFORE THEY WAKE UP.

13:29.570 --> 13:32.459
(chuckles)
I KNOW YOU WANNA KISS ME.

13:36.480 --> 13:39.005
(gasps
(gasps) OH, IV!Y GOD.

13:39.050 --> 13:40.938
(Ian) COME CLOSER.

13:40.980 --> 13:42.140
(rustling)

13:42.180 --> 13:43.545
(clatter)

13:43.590 --> 13:45.808
(thud)
(girls gasp)

13:46.890 --> 13:47.879
(girls gasp)

13:49.360 --> 13:52.056
IAN'S BEEN WATCHING US
FOR YEARS.

13:52.090 --> 13:54.957
AND HE KILLED ALISON TO
MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY FOUND OUT.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.197
(Mona)
HOLDING THE VIDEOS AS RANSOM,

13:58.230 --> 14:00.095
THE GIRLS HAD ALL THEY NEEDED
TO BUST IAN.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.368
(gaSPS)
LOSE SOMETHING?

14:01.400 --> 14:03.504
BUT HE WASN'T ABOUT
TO ROLL OVER.

14:03.540 --> 14:06.236
ASKING FOR MONEY--
THAT WAS CLEVER.

14:07.540 --> 14:09.235
ARE YOUR FRIENDS WAITING
FOR ME?

14:09.280 --> 14:11.441
YOU GONNA TAKE CARE OF ME
LIKE YOU TOOK CARE OF ALISON?

14:12.680 --> 14:15.342
HUH? IS THAT WHY
YOU KILLED HER?

14:15.380 --> 14:18.315
'CAUSE SHE FOUND
YOUR HOME MOVIES?

14:18.350 --> 14:19.886
(memory stick clatters)

14:21.960 --> 14:25.225
(panﬁng)

14:25.260 --> 14:27.148
(metal clanks)
(gasps) AAH!

14:27.200 --> 14:28.952
(shouts indistinctly)

14:29.000 --> 14:30.365
(gasping and panting)

14:30.400 --> 14:32.561
AAH!
IAN ALMOST
SHUT HER UP FOR GOOD,

14:32.600 --> 14:35.569
BUT JUST AS SPENCER WAS
LOSING HER GRIP,

14:35.600 --> 14:37.306
A STRANGE ALLY SHOWED UP.

14:37.340 --> 14:39.160
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:39.210 --> 14:41.098
UHH! OH! AAH!

14:41.140 --> 14:42.334
(thud)

14:42.380 --> 14:46.043
(bell tolling)

14:46.080 --> 14:47.240
SPENCER?

14:47.280 --> 14:49.544
SPENCER! SPENCE!

14:49.580 --> 14:51.116
ARE YOU OKAY?

14:51.150 --> 14:52.242
(tolling continues)

14:52.290 --> 14:54.019
OH, MY GOD.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.948
(tolling continues,
wood creaks)

14:55.990 --> 14:57.321
YOU DID WHAT
YOU HAD TO DO, OKAY?

14:57.360 --> 14:59.089
(voice breaking) NO, I DIDN'T.

14:59.130 --> 15:00.256
SOMEONE ELSE DID.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.621
NO, SPENCER,
THERE'S NOBODY ELSE HERE.

15:02.660 --> 15:04.127
MAYBE HE FELL.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.126
ALL I SAW WAS
A BLACK HOODIE.

15:06.170 --> 15:07.432
"All?

15:07.470 --> 15:08.562
(tolling continues)

15:11.570 --> 15:13.379
"A" TURNED UP JUST IN TIME

15:13.410 --> 15:15.708
TO SAVE SPENCER
FROM A VERY BAD ENDING...

15:15.740 --> 15:17.048
(police radio chatter)

15:17.080 --> 15:19.298
(cell phone alerts chime)

15:19.350 --> 15:22.569
BUT THE GAME
WAS FAR FROM OVER.

15:22.620 --> 15:24.212
OH, MY GOD.

15:24.250 --> 15:25.387
DOES THIS MEAN...

15:25.420 --> 15:27.718
"IT'S NOT OVER
UNTIL I SAY IT IS."

15:27.760 --> 15:29.011
"SLEEP TIGHT"...

15:29.060 --> 15:32.120
(all) "WHILE YOU STILL CAN,
BITCHES.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.297
__A. ll

15:40.100 --> 15:41.965
IAN THOMAS WAS HISTORY,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.560
AND ROSEWOOD BREATHED
A COLLECTIVE SIGH OF RELIEF,

15:44.610 --> 15:47.431
BELIEVING ALISON'S KILLER
WAS DEAD AND GONE.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.040
BUT THE "A" TRAIN ROLLED ON.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.308
THE MESSAGES CONTINUED

15:51.350 --> 15:53.409
AND DIRECTED THEM
TO ALI'S GRAVE.

15:53.450 --> 15:54.542
THIS ISN'T OVER.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.047
AND I THOUGHT
I'D FEEL DIFFERENTLY

15:56.080 --> 15:57.718
ONCE WE BURIED IAN,
BUT I DON'T.

15:57.750 --> 16:00.651
AND IT'S BECAUSE "A" IS STILL
ALIVE AND CALLING THE SHOTS.

16:00.690 --> 16:03.989
UGH. I'M CONFUSED AND I'M
STEPPING ON SOMETHING MUSHY.

16:05.530 --> 16:07.555
(Alison giggles)
(girls gasp)

16:07.600 --> 16:09.591
I KNOW YOU WANNA KISS ME.

16:09.630 --> 16:11.291
(girls gasp)

16:11.330 --> 16:14.163
(giggles)

16:15.400 --> 16:17.163
OH, MY GOD!

16:17.210 --> 16:19.235
SHE WAS STILL ALIVE.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.602
(kisses)

16:21.640 --> 16:24.074
(Mona)
IAN DIDN'T KILL ALISON...
(AlIson giggles)

16:24.110 --> 16:27.216
BUT HE WAS SECRETLY VIDEOTAPING
THE GIRLS,

16:27.250 --> 16:29.070
AND HE TRIED TO KILL SPENCER
IN THE BELL TOWER

16:29.120 --> 16:31.441
TO AVOID BEING EXPOSED.

16:31.490 --> 16:34.482
**

16:34.520 --> 16:38.786
HIS OLD YEARBOOK HELD A CLUE
TO WHAT HE WAS HIDING.

16:38.830 --> 16:40.127
WAIT. STOP. THERE HE IS.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.252
N.A.T. CLUB?

16:41.300 --> 16:42.494
NEVER HEARD OF IT.

16:42.530 --> 16:45.260
IAN WAS A FOUNDING MEMBER
OF THE N.A.T. CLUB.

16:45.300 --> 16:48.690
"NOS ANIMADVERTO TOTUS"?

16:48.740 --> 16:49.991
N.A.T.

16:50.040 --> 16:53.373
IT WAS A SECRET SOCIETY
DEVOTED TO SPYING ON PEOPLE.

16:53.410 --> 16:55.628
"WE SEE ALL."

16:55.680 --> 16:59.241
ALISON'S OLDER BROTHER JASON
WAS ALSO A MEMBER,

16:59.280 --> 17:01.771
ALONG WITH GARRETT REYNOLDS,
A NEWBIE COP

17:01.820 --> 17:05.312
WHO WAS WORKING ON ALI'S CASE
WITH DETECTIVE WILDEN...
(computer beeps)

17:05.350 --> 17:07.818
WHILE SEEING JENNA ON THE SLY.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.282
IT'S OVER, JENNA.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.254
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
TO LINK US TO THAT NIGHT.

17:11.290 --> 17:14.225
SHE DESERVED TO DIE
LIKE THAT.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.198
**

17:18.230 --> 17:20.198
ON THE HUNT FOR MORE ANSWERS,

17:20.240 --> 17:23.403
THE GIRLS DEVISED A SCHEME
TO CORNER "A."

17:23.440 --> 17:25.169
WE LIED TO YOU,
AND YOU BELIEVED US.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.132
THAT WAS YOUR MISTAKE.

17:27.180 --> 17:30.149
BUT THE CLOSE ENCOUNTER GOT
OUT OF CONTROL FAST.

17:30.180 --> 17:31.841
NO! AA
ALI! H!

17:31.880 --> 17:34.314
(crying)
(metal clanks)

17:36.450 --> 17:38.486
(glass shatters)
(girls scream)

17:40.720 --> 17:42.085
(brakes screech)

17:42.120 --> 17:43.121
(thud)

17:49.730 --> 17:52.369
(panﬁng)

17:52.400 --> 17:55.164
DID I JUST HIT
WHO I THINK I DID?
YES!

17:55.200 --> 17:56.428
AND NOW THEY'RE GONE!

17:56.470 --> 17:58.438
WE'VE GOT NOTHING!

17:58.470 --> 18:01.200
BUT THEY DID HAVE SOMETHING.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.379
(whispers)
THAT'S "A's" CELL PHONE.

18:03.410 --> 18:05.378
WHAT'S THAT NUMBER?

18:05.410 --> 18:08.140
TELLS ME HOW MUCH DATA'S
CURRENTLY LOADED ON THE PHONE.

18:08.180 --> 18:09.511
IT'S A LOT.

18:09.550 --> 18:12.587
(beeping)
HANNA'S HO'I'I'IE CALEB
HELPED THEM DECRYPT IT

18:12.620 --> 18:15.453
AND FOUND A VIDEO
FROM THE NIGHT ALI DISAPPEARED.

18:15.490 --> 18:16.718
WHAT THE HELL
ARE JENNA AND GARRETT DOING

18:16.760 --> 18:18.580
IN ALISON'S BEDROOM?

18:18.630 --> 18:19.881
N.A.T. CLUB FIELD TRIP?

18:19.930 --> 18:21.522
I JUST LEFT ALISON.

18:21.560 --> 18:23.198
I TRIED TO GET HER
TO HAND OVER OUR VIDEOS,

18:23.230 --> 18:24.128
BUT SHE WASN'T
GOING FOR IT.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.661
HEY,
THIS IS YOUR FAULT, IAN.

18:26.700 --> 18:27.837
I KNEW YOU'D GO TOO FAR

18:27.870 --> 18:28.996
AND THOSE VIDEOS WOULD
COME BACK TO BITE US.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.304
THAT'S WHY I BAILED
ON THIS MESSED-UP CLUB.

18:31.340 --> 18:34.605
OH, YEAH?
WELL, WELCOME BACK.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.143
NOW HELP ME FIND THEM
BEFORE THAT BITCH SHOWS UP.

18:37.180 --> 18:38.408
(Jenna) SHE'S COMING UPSTAIRS.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.475
ARE WE ABOUT
TO SEE ALISON GET KILLED?

18:40.520 --> 18:42.476
(girls gasp)

18:42.520 --> 18:43.612
WHERE IS SHE?

18:43.650 --> 18:45.208
OH, MY GOD.
(gaSPS)

18:45.250 --> 18:46.649
IT'S MELISSA.

18:46.690 --> 18:47.657
(gasps)

18:47.690 --> 18:49.487
MELISSA, WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN ALISON'S BEDROOM

18:49.520 --> 18:51.181
THE NIGHT
OF HER DISAPPEARANCE?

18:51.230 --> 18:52.424
I THOUGHT WE WERE
BEYOND THIS.

18:52.460 --> 18:54.496
I JUST WANNA HELP YOU, MELISSA.
BECAUSE IF YOU DID SOMETHING--

18:54.530 --> 18:56.157
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.225
I WAS IN THAT HOUSE
LOOKING FOR IAN.

18:58.270 --> 18:59.362
OKAY, SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ANYBODY

18:59.400 --> 19:00.628
THAT YOU SAW
GARRETT AND JENNA THERE?

19:00.670 --> 19:01.796
JUST BECAUSE THEY WANTED
TO SEE ALI DEAD

19:01.840 --> 19:03.364
DOESN'T MEAN
THEY KILLED HER.

19:03.410 --> 19:06.334
HALF THIS TOWN WANTED THAT GIRL
TO DISAPPEAR.

19:06.370 --> 19:07.598
(Mona) HOT ON A's TRAIL,

19:07.640 --> 19:10.768
THE GIRLS DUG THROUGH A BAG
OF ALI'S OLD THINGS...

19:10.810 --> 19:12.300
(Aria) DOUGHERTY'S LANDING?

19:12.350 --> 19:14.409
IT'S A TINY AIRSTRIP
OFF OF HIGHWAY 30.

19:14.450 --> 19:17.647
TRYING TO RETRACE HER STEPS
ON THE DAY SHE DISAPPEARED.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.578
THE LOST WOODS RESORT.

19:19.620 --> 19:21.508
THIS HAS TO BE
WHERE SHE WENT.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.324
**

19:24.360 --> 19:26.248
GUYS, HE WAS A MESSENGER.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.827
THERE'S SOMETHING
FOR EACH OF US.

19:30.330 --> 19:32.560
AN INVITATION FROM "A"...

19:32.600 --> 19:34.795
"BE THERE WHEN THE CLOCK
STRIKES MIDNIGHT."

19:34.840 --> 19:35.864
MEANT THE GIRLS
WOULD ONCE AGAIN

19:35.900 --> 19:37.868
BE FACE-TO-FACE
WITH THEIR TORMENTOR.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.798
"A" WANTS TO PLAY
HIDE-AND-SEEK.

19:39.840 --> 19:42.308
AT THE MASQUERADE BALL,

19:42.340 --> 19:44.740
THE GIRLS KEPT THEIR EYES
PEELED FOR SIGNS OF "A"

19:44.780 --> 19:47.476
WHILE SLOW DANCING
WITH THEIR SWEETHEARTS.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.817
THIS IS OUR FIRST DANCE.

19:48.850 --> 19:50.818
I WANNA SEE YOU.

19:52.350 --> 19:54.910
SPENCER, DON'T GO OUT THERE
ALONE. JUST WAIT FOR US.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.827
NO, I DON'T WANT US ALL
TO LEAVE. WE CAN'T TIP "A" OFF.

19:57.860 --> 20:00.294
AND BESIDES, I'M NOT ALONE.
I'M WITH MONA.

20:00.330 --> 20:01.422
SPENCER RECRUITED ME

20:01.460 --> 20:03.894
TO HELP INVESTIGATE
THE LOST WOODS RESORT.

20:05.630 --> 20:08.463
BUT WHEN WE GOT THERE...

20:08.500 --> 20:09.797
OH, MY GOD.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.809
SHE WAS SHOCKED
BY WHAT SHE FOUND.

20:12.840 --> 20:15.877
THIS IS A's LAIR.

20:18.910 --> 20:19.899
I'LL CALL HANNA.

20:23.620 --> 20:27.386
(door closes)
SPENCER'S A VERY SMART GIRL.

20:27.420 --> 20:28.512
GUM?

20:28.560 --> 20:30.721
UH, NO, THANKS.
OKAY.

20:30.760 --> 20:33.593
THERE WERE CLUES
ALL OVER THE PLACE...

20:33.630 --> 20:35.996
CASHMERE SWEATERS.

20:36.030 --> 20:37.327
YOU WANT A SWEATER SET?

20:37.370 --> 20:38.769
CASHMERE BLEND.

20:38.800 --> 20:42.463
AND SHE FINALLY
PUT IT ALL TOGETHER.

20:42.500 --> 20:46.960
YOU DIDN'T CALL HANNA,
DID YOU?

20:47.010 --> 20:47.999
BECAUSE YOU'RE "A."

20:48.040 --> 20:50.975
CONGRATULATIONS, SPENCER.

20:51.010 --> 20:52.272
(gasps)

20:52.310 --> 20:55.370
YOU FIGURED IT OUT.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.411
(slaps
UHH!)

20:57.450 --> 20:59.281
WHEN SPENCER CAME TO...
(groans)

20:59.320 --> 21:01.550
SHE FOUND HERSELF
ON THE RIDE OF HER LIFE...

21:01.590 --> 21:04.024
(tires screeching)
AND I WAS AT THE WHEEL.

21:04.060 --> 21:06.654
I ADMIRE YOU, SPENCER.
(revs engine)

21:06.690 --> 21:09.898
THAT'S WHY YOU GET TO DECIDE
HOW THIS ENDS TONIGHT.

21:09.930 --> 21:12.592
YOU CAN JOIN THE A-TEAM,

21:12.630 --> 21:14.291
OR YOU CAN DISAPPEAR.

21:16.900 --> 21:17.935
Why did you do it?
(engine revs)

21:17.970 --> 21:19.904
How could you be everywhere?

21:19.940 --> 21:22.079
YOU WERE ALWAYS
ONE STEP AHEAD OF US.

21:22.110 --> 21:25.739
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY GENIUS
IN THIS CAR.

21:25.780 --> 21:27.816
You bitches
underestimated me.

21:27.850 --> 21:28.874
OH, MY GOD.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.512
IT'S MONA.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.484
(rewing engine)

21:32.520 --> 21:33.782
WE ARE NEVER GONNA MAKE IT
TO LOOK OUT POINT

21:33.820 --> 21:35.515
IF YOU DON'T SLOW DOWN.

21:35.560 --> 21:36.754
(tires screech)

21:36.790 --> 21:40.396
THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK OUT POINT.
I JUST A SHORTCUT. COME ON.

21:40.430 --> 21:42.648
YOU DESERVED EVERYTHING
YOU GOT.

21:42.700 --> 21:44.463
(tires screech)

21:45.700 --> 21:46.769
(tires screech)

21:46.800 --> 21:49.030
(brake clicks, tires screech)

21:49.070 --> 21:51.800
(thud)
AAH!

21:51.840 --> 21:56.072
(panﬁng)

21:56.110 --> 21:59.876
HANNA, STOP!
HANNA! HANNA, STOP!

21:59.910 --> 22:01.343
HAN NA!
HAN NA!

22:01.380 --> 22:04.417
(brakes screech)

22:04.450 --> 22:06.714
(pants)

22:08.160 --> 22:10.378
AAH! AH!

22:10.430 --> 22:11.829
(Aria) CHASE HER!
AAH!

22:11.860 --> 22:13.828
UHH! AAH!

22:13.860 --> 22:15.691
(gasping)
(wood cracks)

22:15.730 --> 22:17.049
AAH!
MONA! MONA!

22:17.100 --> 22:19.625
(thudding)
OH, MY GOD!

22:19.670 --> 22:21.695
(girls gasping)

22:21.740 --> 22:23.435
I SURVIVED THE FALL...

22:23.470 --> 22:26.007
(alert beeps)
BUT NOT THE FALLOUT.

22:26.040 --> 22:28.975
GRANTED, MENTAL PATIENT WASN'T
MY BEST LOOK.

22:29.010 --> 22:30.875
(door creaks)
BUT CARRYING OUT
A VENGEFUL PLOT

22:30.910 --> 22:32.468
WHILE HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT

22:32.510 --> 22:34.842
TAKES ITS TOLL ON A GIRL.

22:34.880 --> 22:38.384
THANK GOODNESS
FOR VISITING HOURS.

22:40.020 --> 22:43.581
I DID EVERYTHING
YOU ASKED ME TO.

22:51.770 --> 22:53.692
FIVE MONTHS HAD PASSED

22:53.740 --> 22:56.061
SINCE I WAS OUTED AS "A."

22:56.100 --> 22:59.661
WHILE I WAS EATING JELL-O
IN THE RADLEY SANITARIUM...

22:59.710 --> 23:01.678
WELCOME BACK.
CHEERS.

23:01.710 --> 23:03.746
THE GIRLS TOASTED RED CUPS
AT A SLUMBER PARTY

23:03.780 --> 23:05.998
TO CELEBRATE THE START
OF SENIOR YEAR.

23:06.050 --> 23:07.108
HAN NA.

23:07.150 --> 23:09.869
BUT AFTER A FEW
TOO MANY REFRESHMENTS...

23:09.920 --> 23:12.480
I NEED AN ASPIRIN
AND A TROUGH OF WATER.

23:12.520 --> 23:14.818
THEY WOKE TO FIND
EMILY MISSING.

23:14.860 --> 23:15.918
I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.558
(cell phone rings)

23:20.600 --> 23:22.556
(thunderclap)
AND WHEN SHE FINALLY TURNED UP,

23:22.600 --> 23:25.967
SHE WAS STANDING AT THE FOOT
OF ALI'S DUG-UP GRAVE,

23:26.000 --> 23:29.037
AND THE COFFIN WAS EMPTY.

23:29.070 --> 23:32.130
(thunderclap)

23:32.170 --> 23:33.501
YOU DON'T THINK
THAT SHE HAD ANYTHING

23:33.540 --> 23:35.428
TO DO WITH THIS, DO YOU?
NO.

23:35.480 --> 23:37.175
I MEAN,
WHO WOULD DO THIS TO ALI?

23:37.210 --> 23:40.179
EMILY HAD NO MEMORY
OF THE NIGHT'S EVENTS.

23:40.210 --> 23:43.145
THE STUNT HAD "A" WRITTEN
ALL OVER IT.

23:43.180 --> 23:44.784
YOU GUYS, THIS IS A SETUP.
(thunderclap)

23:44.820 --> 23:46.549
WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.
NOW.

23:46.590 --> 23:47.614
BUT THE GIRLS HAD A HUNCH

23:47.660 --> 23:49.958
THERE WAS ANOTHER BITCH
ON THEIR TAILS,

23:49.990 --> 23:52.049
AND THEY WERE ALL SEEING RED.

23:52.090 --> 23:54.593
EVEN EMILY, WHOSE MEMORIES
OF THAT LOST NIGHT

23:54.630 --> 23:55.824
WERE COMING BACK.

23:55.860 --> 23:57.498
STOP! (muffled cry)

23:57.530 --> 23:58.667
(Emily) THE GIRL...

23:58.700 --> 24:01.464
THE GIRL IN THE RED COAT.

24:02.670 --> 24:03.830
(engine starts)

24:03.870 --> 24:05.804
BUT A FLASHBACK OF BLIND JENNA
BEHIND THE WHEEL

24:05.840 --> 24:07.068
DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

24:07.110 --> 24:08.702
SHE WAS DRIVING THAT NIGHT,
GUYS.

24:08.740 --> 24:10.173
I REMEMBERED, CLEARLY.

24:10.210 --> 24:11.700
HONESTLY, I-I DON'T THINK

24:11.750 --> 24:13.638
THAT YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING
CLEARLY FROM THAT NIGHT.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.773
SHE CAN SEE. SHE'S PROBABLY
ON MONA'S PAYROLL.

24:15.820 --> 24:17.685
NO, MONA DOES NOT HAVE
ANY CASH.

24:17.720 --> 24:18.914
THEY WON'T EVEN LET HER
HAVE FLOSS.

24:18.950 --> 24:21.748
BUT EMILY CONVINCED THE GIRLS
TO FOLLOW JENNA.

24:21.790 --> 24:22.950
THAT'S THE CAR, ISN'T IT?

24:22.990 --> 24:24.821
THAT'S THE ONE.

24:24.860 --> 24:26.782
AND I WOULD'VE LOVED TO SEE

24:26.830 --> 24:29.219
THE LOOK ON HER FACE
WHEN THEY CAUGHT HER.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.693
(brakes squeal)

24:30.730 --> 24:32.266
WOW, JENNA.

24:32.300 --> 24:34.564
WHAT A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.091
(Spencer) ALL THIS TIME,
YOU COULD SEE.

24:37.140 --> 24:38.835
FROM THE VERY FIRST
OPERATION?

24:38.870 --> 24:40.064
YES.
(siren wailing in distance)

24:40.110 --> 24:42.578
HOW COULD YOU LIE
ABOUT THIS?

24:42.610 --> 24:44.168
IF PEOPLE THINK
THAT YOU'RE BLIND,

24:44.210 --> 24:45.973
THEY GET CARELESS.

24:46.010 --> 24:48.069
YOU SEE WHAT THEY DON'T THINK
YOU CAN SEE.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.246
GOD, YOU ARE SO TWISTED.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.510
I WONDER HOW I GOT
THAT WAY.

24:52.990 --> 24:54.719
THE GIRLS WERE STILL TRYING
TO MAKE SENSE

24:54.760 --> 24:55.909
OF ALI'S GRAVE ROBBING,

24:55.960 --> 24:59.657
SO HANNA BECAME
MY REGULAR VISITOR AT RADLEY.

24:59.690 --> 25:02.124
WE THOUGHT YOU BEING IN HERE
WAS THE END OF IT, AND IT'S NOT.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.560
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.727
THE QUESTION IS,
HOWYOU KNOW?

25:06.770 --> 25:08.988
HANNA WANTED ANSWERS,
AND I KNOW SHE DESERVED THEM,

25:09.040 --> 25:10.962
BUT I COULDN'T GIVE HER
WHAT SHE NEEDED.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.261
NOT YET.

25:12.310 --> 25:15.234
**

25:15.280 --> 25:17.236
(bell dings)

25:17.280 --> 25:19.601
EVERYONE LOVES
A HALLOWEEN PARTY.

25:19.650 --> 25:21.015
I LIKE THIS.

25:21.050 --> 25:23.712
TRAVEL IS SO ROMANTIC.

25:23.750 --> 25:26.287
AND ALL THE GIRLS ENJOYED
A FEW TRICKS

25:26.320 --> 25:27.856
WITH THEIR FAVORITE TREATS.

25:27.890 --> 25:29.289
(metal squeals)

25:29.320 --> 25:31.254
GARRETT HAD SOMETHING
TO GET OFF HIS CHEST.

25:31.290 --> 25:34.691
I TOOK JENNA OUTSIDE TO LET IAN
AND MELISSA TALK THINGS OVER.

25:34.730 --> 25:36.027
WHERE DID YOU GO WITH JENNA?

25:36.060 --> 25:37.823
BEHIND THE DiLAURENTIS HOUSE.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.599
WHERE THE GROUND
WAS DUG UP?

25:39.630 --> 25:40.836
(bell dings)

25:40.870 --> 25:43.759
WE SHOULDN'T LEAVE
THOSE TWO TOGETHER, GARRETT.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.038
WE CAN'T TRUST THEM.

25:45.070 --> 25:46.628
THERE'S NOTHING
THEY CAN DO TO US

25:46.670 --> 25:48.774
WITHOUT SCREWING EVERYTHING UP
FOR THEMSELVES.

25:48.810 --> 25:51.005
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

25:51.050 --> 25:53.143
DIDN'T FIND WHAT YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR IN MY BEDROOM?

25:53.180 --> 25:54.317
DO SOMETHING.

25:54.350 --> 25:57.046
AAH! AAH!
(thudding)

25:57.080 --> 25:58.889
IS SHE DEAD?

25:58.920 --> 26:01.753
(Garrett)
SHE WAS ALIVE WHEN I LEFT.
(thunderclap)

26:01.790 --> 26:03.280
(train horn blows)
I DIDN'T KILL ALISON.

26:03.320 --> 26:05.788
BUT JENNA THINKS I DID.

26:05.830 --> 26:07.798
APPARENTLY
SOMEONE DIDN'T APPRECIATE

26:07.830 --> 26:09.798
GARRETT SPILLING THE BEANS,

26:09.830 --> 26:12.025
BECAUSE AFTER
THE QUEEN OF HEARTS

26:12.070 --> 26:14.095
SLIPPED ARIA A MICKEY...

26:14.140 --> 26:15.835
(grunts)

26:15.870 --> 26:18.805
SHE WOKE UP IN HER OWN
PRIVATE QUARTERS WITH GARRETT.

26:18.840 --> 26:20.159
AAH!

26:20.210 --> 26:22.678
AND HE DIDN'T WAKE UP
AT ALL.
AAH!

26:22.710 --> 26:24.177
(train whistle blows,
bell dings)

26:24.210 --> 26:27.077
TWO MEMBERS OF THE N.A.T. CLUB
DEAD.

26:27.110 --> 26:29.817
TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THAT ROOM
THE NIGHT THAT ALI WAS KILLED.

26:29.850 --> 26:31.818
THE POLICE PUT THE TRAIN
ON LOCKDOWN...

26:31.850 --> 26:32.942
(police radio chatter)

26:32.990 --> 26:34.218
WHY DON'T YOU TELL THE COPS
YOU DID IT

26:34.260 --> 26:35.955
SO THE REST OF US
CAN GO HOME?

26:35.990 --> 26:37.014
YOU KNOW WHAT?
CAN IT, NOEL.

26:37.060 --> 26:38.925
AND THAT'S WHEN THINGS
GOT INTERESTING.

26:38.960 --> 26:40.052
BACK OFF.

26:40.090 --> 26:42.229
OR WHAT?

26:42.260 --> 26:44.228
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW,
NOEL.

26:44.270 --> 26:47.194
(clattering)

26:50.170 --> 26:51.967
(gasps)

26:52.010 --> 26:54.706
EVEN DRESSED
IN A BODY BAG...
(p0p5)

26:54.740 --> 26:57.971
ALISON HAD A KNACK
FOR MAKING AN ENTRANCE.

26:58.010 --> 27:00.979
THE GIRLS BEGAN TO REALIZE
THAT YOURS TRULY

27:01.020 --> 27:02.715
MIGHT NOT
HAVE BEEN WORKING ALONE.

27:02.750 --> 27:04.411
FOR ALL WE KNOW, IT'S NOT
JUST MONA AND HER MINION.

27:04.450 --> 27:06.839
MAYBE SHE'S BUILT
THIS WHOLE "A" ARMY.

27:06.890 --> 27:09.085
WE STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT HER END GAME IS.

27:09.120 --> 27:10.883
LET'S JUST WAIT. WE'LL TALK
ABOUT IT IN THE MORNING.

27:10.930 --> 27:12.124
(jangles key)

27:12.160 --> 27:13.855
SPENCER JUST COULDN'T LEAVE
WELL ENOUGH ALONE.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.219
I GOTTA GET READY
FOR TONIGHT.

27:17.200 --> 27:21.739
AND THE HEART SHE WAS ABOUT
TO BREAK WAS HER OWN.

27:21.770 --> 27:23.362
IS THIS WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?

27:23.400 --> 27:26.301
SOMETIMES THE ONLY THING WORSE
THAN A LIE...

27:26.340 --> 27:28.274
(thunderclap)

27:28.310 --> 27:30.232
IS THE TRUTH.

27:30.280 --> 27:32.248
(key clatters)

27:32.280 --> 27:33.349
(sniffles)

27:37.080 --> 27:38.786
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN?

27:40.250 --> 27:44.129
SPENCER FOUND THE I.D.
THAT TOBY USED

27:44.160 --> 27:46.287
TO MEET ME AT RADLEY.

27:46.330 --> 27:47.957
(woman) SPENCER?

27:49.930 --> 27:51.022
(thunderclap)

27:51.070 --> 27:53.766
LUCKY FOR ME,
I DIDN'T NEED IT ANYMORE.

27:53.800 --> 27:56.234
(gasps)

27:56.270 --> 27:58.135
(gasps and pants)

27:58.170 --> 28:00.775
IS THIS A BAD TIME?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

28:00.810 --> 28:03.028
MY DOCTORS RELEASED ME.
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?

28:03.080 --> 28:05.071
LOOK, HANNA,
I NEED YOUR HELP.

28:05.110 --> 28:07.169
MY PARENTS ARE FORCING ME
TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL,

28:07.210 --> 28:09.349
AND I'M...
LOOK, I'M SO SCARED.

28:09.380 --> 28:11.211
MONA--
EVERYONE KNOWS
WHAT I'VE DONE,

28:11.250 --> 28:13.309
AND I HAVE NO ONE
IN MY CORNER.

28:13.350 --> 28:15.056
IF YOU'RE EXPECTING ME
AND MY FRIENDS TO FORGIVE YOU--

28:15.090 --> 28:17.149
I DON'T EXPECT THEM TO,
BUT...

28:17.190 --> 28:19.784
HANNA, YOU'RE DIFFERENT.

28:19.830 --> 28:21.923
(keys jangle)

28:21.960 --> 28:23.291
(sniffles)

28:23.330 --> 28:25.389
(keys jangle)

28:25.430 --> 28:27.125
SPENCER ALWAYS SAYS...
(crYIng)

28:27.170 --> 28:30.333
"HOPE BREEDS ETERNAL MISERY."

28:30.370 --> 28:32.201
AND I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

28:32.240 --> 28:35.175
(Spencer crying) PLEASE...

28:35.210 --> 28:37.940
(sniffles) JUST TELL ME THAT
THERE'S MORE TO THE STORY.

28:37.980 --> 28:39.902
(continues crying)

28:39.950 --> 28:43.113
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I DON'T KNOW.

28:43.150 --> 28:45.516
A GIRL CAN ONLY TAKE
SO MUCH...

28:45.550 --> 28:48.110
(continues crying)
PLEASE. PLEASE, TOBY.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.287
BEFORE SHE BREAKS.

28:55.930 --> 28:57.818
THEY'VE RELEASED ALI'S REMAINS
TO MY FAMILY.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.223
THERE'S GONNA BE
A REINTERNMENT.

28:59.270 --> 29:00.464
SHE'S BEING BURIED AGAIN?

29:00.500 --> 29:02.434
NOT IN THE GROUND.
IN A MAUSOLEUM.

29:02.470 --> 29:04.506
I'LL TEXT YOU
WHEN I KNOW THE DETAILS

29:04.540 --> 29:06.132
ABOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE TO ALI.

29:06.170 --> 29:09.230
DON'T BOTHER. I'VE SAID ALL
THE GOOD-BYES I WANT TO SAY.

29:09.280 --> 29:11.441
UH, SPENCER...
(Spencer) WHAT?

29:11.480 --> 29:13.038
I MEAN, SHE'S SAINT ALI NOW?

29:13.080 --> 29:14.877
ARE HER BONES
HOLY RELICS OR SOMETHING?

29:14.920 --> 29:16.273
OKAY, YOU NEED
TO DIAL IT BACK.

29:16.320 --> 29:18.117
NO, YOU DIAL IT BACK.
OKAY?

29:18.150 --> 29:19.811
I'M FINISHED WITH ALL OF THIS.

29:19.850 --> 29:22.114
YOU GUYS WANT TO PAY A VISIT TO
THE CRYPT KEEPER, THAT'S FINE.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.425
IT'S YOUR BUSINESS.
BUT KEEP ME OUT OF IT.

29:25.460 --> 29:27.155
POOR SPENCE.

29:27.190 --> 29:29.420
SHE WAS SO UPSET ABOUT
TOBY'S TURN ON THE A-TEAM,

29:29.460 --> 29:31.394
AND SHE STILL HADN'T TOLD
HER FRIENDS ABOUT IT.

29:31.430 --> 29:34.035
SPENCER, I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T
WANT A FRIEND RIGHT NOW,

29:34.070 --> 29:36.561
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
YOUR FRIENDS DON'T NEED YOU.

29:36.600 --> 29:40.104
ARIA WAS OFFERING SPENCE
A WAY OUT,

29:40.140 --> 29:41.971
BUT SHE WAS IN
OVER HER HEAD, TOO.

29:42.010 --> 29:43.432
HELLO.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.243
EZRA FOUND OUT HE HAD A SON,

29:45.280 --> 29:47.009
AND LITTLE FITZ WAS HERE
TO STAY.

29:47.050 --> 29:49.541
MALCOLM, THIS... IS ARIA.

29:49.580 --> 29:52.185
NICE TO MEET YOU.

29:52.220 --> 29:53.414
I STILL CANNOT BELIEVE

29:53.450 --> 29:55.008
THAT YOU'RE BABYSITTING
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S KID.

29:55.060 --> 29:56.880
YEAH? YEAH, WELL,
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE

29:56.920 --> 29:59.024
THAT MY BOYFRIEND
HAS A KID.

29:59.060 --> 30:03.997
SO WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IF
MALCOLM AND MAGGIE MOVE HERE?

30:04.030 --> 30:05.588
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
(closes refrigerator)

30:05.630 --> 30:07.564
WELL, WHEN THEY WERE
IN DELAWARE,

30:07.600 --> 30:09.158
THAT WAS ONE THING,

30:09.200 --> 30:10.565
BUT IF THEY COME HERE...
(lquId pourlng)

30:10.600 --> 30:12.966
WHERE DOES THAT
LEAVE YOU AND EZRA?

30:13.010 --> 30:15.331
I DON'T KNOW.

30:15.380 --> 30:18.247
BUT WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
WE ALWAYS DO.

30:18.280 --> 30:21.169
**

30:21.220 --> 30:25.316
ANOTHER CHAPTER FROM ALI'S PAST
WAS BLOWN WIDE OPEN

30:25.350 --> 30:27.511
WHEN AN OLD FRIEND OF HERS
SHOWED UP IN ROSEWOOD.

30:27.550 --> 30:28.983
I'M CeCe.

30:29.020 --> 30:30.988
OUR FAMILIES RENTED SUMMER HOMES
IN CAPE MAY.

30:31.030 --> 30:33.624
WE WENT THROUGH AN INTENSE
COUPLE WEEKS TOGETHER.

30:33.660 --> 30:35.958
I DATED HER BROTHER JASON.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.264
SHE TALKED ABOUT ALL OF YOU.

30:38.300 --> 30:39.562
FROM THE DETAILS
IN ALI'S NOTEBOOK,

30:39.600 --> 30:43.468
THE GIRL WHO WAS ALWAYS
IN CONTROL FINALLY LOST IT.

30:43.500 --> 30:44.603
I THINK I'M IN TROUBLE.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.232
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:46.270 --> 30:48.977
I'M LATE.

30:49.010 --> 30:50.329
HAVE YOU TOLD HIM?

30:50.380 --> 30:51.608
I CAN'T.

30:51.650 --> 30:55.518
LOOK, IF HE FINDS OUT,
HE'S GONNA KILL ME.

30:55.550 --> 30:56.778
EMILY WENT TO JASON

30:56.820 --> 30:59.288
TO FIND OUT WHO SAW
ALI'S TAN LINES THAT SUMMER.

30:59.320 --> 31:00.514
WILDEN.

31:00.550 --> 31:02.552
CeCe TOLD YOU
SHE DIDN'T KNOW HIM?

31:02.590 --> 31:05.479
WHY'D SHE LIE?
IS SHE PROTECTING HIM?

31:05.530 --> 31:07.225
MIGHT BE
PROTECTING HERSELF.

31:07.260 --> 31:08.488
WHY?

31:08.530 --> 31:10.589
MAYBE THEY HAD
THEIR OWN THING GOING ON.

31:10.630 --> 31:12.962
MAYBE SHE PLANNED ON
MEETING UP WITH HIM THAT NIGHT.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.560
WHAT NIGHT?

31:15.600 --> 31:18.569
THE LAST NIGHT
MY SISTER WAS ALIVE.

31:18.610 --> 31:21.238
JASON'S MEMORY WAS HAZY...

31:21.280 --> 31:22.975
(girls speaking indistinctly)
BUT HE KNEW WHO HE'D SEEN
THAT NIGHT.

31:23.010 --> 31:24.238
(water running)
ALI?

31:25.680 --> 31:27.477
(thunderclap)

31:27.510 --> 31:30.274
(thunder rumbling)

31:30.320 --> 31:32.686
JASON SAID HE SAW YOU
AT HIS HOUSE

31:32.720 --> 31:35.086
THE NIGHT ALI DISAPPEARED.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.452
HE TOLD YOU THAT?

31:37.490 --> 31:39.526
GOD, THIS IS SO MESSED UP.

31:39.560 --> 31:40.652
WHY WERE YOU THERE?

31:40.690 --> 31:42.123
ALI CALLED.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.594
SHE WAS FREAKING OUT
ABOUT SOME VIDEOS.

31:44.630 --> 31:46.029
EVERYONE WANTED 'EM,

31:46.070 --> 31:48.664
SPENCER'S BIG SISTER
MORE THAN ANYONE.

31:48.700 --> 31:51.669
WHEN I SHOWED UP,
SHE BEGGED ME TO TALK TO ALI,

31:51.710 --> 31:53.109
SO I DID.

31:53.140 --> 31:55.438
THEN ALI LEFT
TO GO GET THEM.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.209
NEXT DAY,

31:57.240 --> 31:59.299
SHE WAS MISSING.

32:01.450 --> 32:04.248
WHO TOOK THAT PICTURE?

32:04.290 --> 32:06.588
YOU THREE ON A SAILBOAT--
WHO TOOK IT?

32:08.090 --> 32:09.455
MELISSA HASTINGS.

32:11.590 --> 32:14.491
**

32:14.530 --> 32:17.419
WHEN HANNA STARTED MAKING NOISE
ABOUT ALI AND WILDEN,

32:17.460 --> 32:19.166
HE REACHED OUT TO ASHLEY,

32:19.200 --> 32:21.293
AND IT WASN'T TO TALK ABOUT
THE GOOD OLD DAYS.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.558
TEENAGERS AREN'T AWARE
OF THE RAMIFICATIONS

32:23.600 --> 32:25.534
OF WHAT THEY SAY.

32:25.570 --> 32:28.437
IF IT'S OUTRAGEOUS,
WHY DO YOU SEEM SO NERVOUS?

32:28.480 --> 32:30.277
IN A TOWN LIKE THIS,

32:30.310 --> 32:33.700
AN ACCUSATION LIKE THAT
WOULD BE THE END OF ME.

32:33.750 --> 32:35.240
(indistinct conversations)

32:35.280 --> 32:36.508
(siren whooping)

32:36.550 --> 32:38.188
ANY CROOKED COP KNOWS
THAT SOMETIMES

32:38.220 --> 32:40.279
YOU NEED TO USE
THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW

32:40.320 --> 32:41.412
TO APPLY MORE PRESSURE.

32:41.460 --> 32:42.984
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

32:43.020 --> 32:44.749
HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING?

32:44.790 --> 32:46.348
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32:46.390 --> 32:47.527
PLEASE STEP OUT
OF THE CAR.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.425
(police radio chatter)

32:49.460 --> 32:51.724
CAN YOU KEEP HANNA QUIET
OR NOT?

32:51.770 --> 32:53.226
(sighs) IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE
THIS DISCUSSION,

32:53.270 --> 32:54.430
CALL MY LAWYER.

32:54.470 --> 32:56.199
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
WITH SECRETS.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.333
DON'T THREATEN ME.
HEY.

32:58.370 --> 33:00.668
LET GO OF ME.

33:00.710 --> 33:03.338
HEY, WE'RE NOT DONE HERE.
GET OUT OF MY WAY!

33:03.380 --> 33:04.506
(engine starts)
I CAN'T LET YOU GO.

33:04.550 --> 33:06.074
GET OUT OF MY WAY!
(honks horn)

33:06.110 --> 33:08.169
EITHER YOU SHUT HANNA UP,
OR I WILL!

33:10.280 --> 33:11.588
(gasps)

33:11.620 --> 33:14.088
OH!

33:14.120 --> 33:16.008
(Ashley) THERE.

33:16.060 --> 33:18.722
RETURNING TO THE SCENE
IS A ROOKIE MISTAKE.

33:18.760 --> 33:20.489
I DON'T WANT YOU
SEEING THIS.

33:20.530 --> 33:22.725
LOOK, I'M NOT LETTING YOU
DO THIS ALONE.

33:22.760 --> 33:24.591
BUT IF THERE'S NO BODY...

33:24.630 --> 33:26.222
(Hanna) WHERE'S WILDEN?

33:26.270 --> 33:28.295
I DON'T KNOW.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.637
THERE'S NO CRIME.

33:29.670 --> 33:31.558
SAME GOES FOR EVIDENCE.

33:31.610 --> 33:34.499
KNOWING THAT THE SQUAD CAR
RECORDED EVERYTHING...

33:34.540 --> 33:37.634
(splash)
HANNA RECRUITED ARIA
TO DEEP-SIX IT.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.375
(gurgling)
IF THEY FIND IT

33:39.410 --> 33:41.378
AND THEY TRACE IT BACK TO US,
WE ARE TOTALLY SCREWED.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.775
YEP.

33:46.390 --> 33:49.257
**

33:49.290 --> 33:51.520
WE ALL KNOW THESE BITCHES
CAN'T KEEP A SECRET.

33:51.560 --> 33:53.551
AND SPENCER FINALLY TOLD
HER FRIENDS

33:53.590 --> 33:55.251
THE TRUTH ABOUT TOBY.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.393
(crying) TOBY IS "A."

33:57.430 --> 33:58.465
(gasps)

33:58.500 --> 34:01.264
(Emily) OKAY, WE ALL KNOW
HOW MUCH TOBY LOVES YOU.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.291
THIS CAN'T BE TRUE. THERE HAS TO
BE MORE TO THE STORY.

34:03.340 --> 34:05.137
IF HE LOVED ME,

34:05.170 --> 34:07.138
HE WOULD NOT HAVE LET ME
SIT OUTSIDE OF HIS LOFT

34:07.170 --> 34:09.400
BAWLING MY EYES OUT
FOR HOURS.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.806
I AM SO SORRY, SPENCE.
(continues crying)

34:11.850 --> 34:15.149
THE TOBY I KNOW WOULD NEVER
DO ANYTHING TO HURT ANY OF US.

34:15.180 --> 34:18.149
(laughs)

34:18.190 --> 34:19.680
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

34:19.720 --> 34:22.587
YOU TRYING TO MAKE SENSE
OF THIS.

34:22.620 --> 34:24.827
YOU NEED TO STOP THINKING
ABOUT TOBY

34:24.860 --> 34:26.555
AS THE PERSON
THAT YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW

34:26.590 --> 34:28.626
AND START LOOKING AT HIM
FOR WHO HE REALLY IS.

34:28.660 --> 34:31.595
THE QUICKER YOU WRAP YOUR MIND
AROUND THIS, THE BETTER.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.690
(sniffles)

34:34.740 --> 34:37.493
SPENCER SUSPECT ED I REALLY
WASN'T ALL BETTER NOW,

34:37.540 --> 34:40.259
AND SHE FOLLOWED ME
INTO THE WOODS.

34:40.310 --> 34:42.369
BUT CURIOSITY CAN BE
A REAL KILLER.

34:43.710 --> 34:47.100
TOBY'S TATTOO
WAS UNMISTAKABLE.

34:47.150 --> 34:48.378
(Mona) HE'S DEAD.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.445
(sobs)
AND THE SHOCK PUT SPENCER
OVER THE EDGE.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.482
(sobbing)

34:52.520 --> 34:53.839
(man) No name?

34:53.890 --> 34:54.788
YEP. JANE DOE.

34:54.820 --> 34:58.586
NO ID. NO CELL PHONE.
NO KEYS. NOTHING.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.780
SHE WOUND UP
RIGHT WHERE I WANTED HER...

35:00.830 --> 35:02.195
(lock clicks, keys jangle)

35:02.230 --> 35:04.425
IN MY OLD ROOM AT RADLEY.

35:04.470 --> 35:06.461
IT WAS ONLY POLITE
TO PAY A VISIT.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.730
I BET YOU WERE SURPRISED
TO SEE ME.

35:08.770 --> 35:10.499
YOU'RE TAKING A BIG RISK,

35:10.540 --> 35:12.508
COMING HERE.

35:12.540 --> 35:15.873
LOOK AT ALL THAT'S HAPPENED
SINCE YOU TURNED ME DOWN

35:15.910 --> 35:17.878
ON OUR LITTLE DRIVE
UP THE MOUNTAIN.

35:17.910 --> 35:20.470
ALL THE PAIN AND DISAPPOINTMENT
AND LOSS

35:20.510 --> 35:23.343
BECAUSE YOU WERE STUBBORN.

35:23.380 --> 35:25.245
(Mona) YOU NEED ME.

35:25.290 --> 35:28.214
OTHERWISE, YOU'LL NEVER REALLY
KNOW ANYTHING FOR SURE.

35:28.260 --> 35:31.229
(Spencer) YOU DON'T
HAVE TO ASK ME AGAIN, MONA.

35:31.260 --> 35:33.251
I'M IN.

35:37.530 --> 35:39.623
OH, YOU GOTTA LOVE
THE HASTINGS.

35:39.670 --> 35:41.638
I JUST GET RELEASED
FROM A MENTAL HOSPITAL,

35:41.670 --> 35:44.707
AND THEY WELCOME MY FRIENDS
WITH TEA AND CRUMPETS.

35:44.740 --> 35:46.503
HOW ARE YOU, SPENCE?

35:46.540 --> 35:47.905
I'M ALL RIGHT.

35:47.940 --> 35:50.329
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PRETEND TO BE OKAY FOR US.

35:50.380 --> 35:55.249
WHEN I SAW TOBY
IN THE WOODS... LIKE THAT,

35:55.280 --> 35:56.747
I JUST GAVE UP.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.543
SO WHAT CHANGED?

35:58.590 --> 36:00.717
YOU SEEM LIKE
YOU'RE BACK TO YOURSELF.

36:00.750 --> 36:04.186
I DECIDED I DIDN'T WANT
TO BE A VICTIM ANYMORE.

36:06.430 --> 36:08.227
THAT'S NOT WHO I AM.

36:08.260 --> 36:10.319
SPENCER WAS PLAYING
FOR TH E HOE-RFEAM NOW.

36:10.360 --> 36:13.295
AND SHE KNEW THESE GIRLS
WERE ALWAYS UP FOR A PARTY.

36:13.330 --> 36:14.763
I COULD REALLY USE
SOME SUPPORT.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.688
CAN YOU GUYS PLEASE COME?

36:16.740 --> 36:17.798
OF COURSE.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.262
SURE.

36:19.310 --> 36:20.663
YEAH. YOU KNOW
WE'D DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.

36:20.710 --> 36:22.837
I'M COUNTING ON THAT.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.848
SHE HAD BEEN FOLLOWING
MY ORDERS

36:24.880 --> 36:26.302
SINCE_HER RELEASE FROM_RADLEY.
(chlldren speaking lndlstlnctly)

36:26.350 --> 36:29.444
AND SHE EARNED MY TRUST
WHEN SHE BORROWED EZRA'S SON

36:29.480 --> 36:31.289
ON ARIA'S WATCH.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.344
I'M HERE TO PICK UP MALCOLM.

36:32.390 --> 36:35.553
OH, HE WAS ALREADY PICKED UP
ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO.

36:35.590 --> 36:38.252
WHEN THE KID WENT MISSING
FOR A FEW HOURS...

36:38.290 --> 36:40.224
I SWEAR, IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO
THAT LITTLE BOY BECAUSE OF ME,

36:40.260 --> 36:41.659
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.589
IT WAS ENOUGH TO SCARE ARIA
INTO CALL IT QUITS WITH EZRA.

36:44.630 --> 36:47.519
(crying) NOTHING ABOUT US
FEELS RIGHT ANYMORE.

36:47.570 --> 36:50.892
THINGS AREN'T EASY,
BUT THEY CAN STILL BE GOOD.

36:50.940 --> 36:52.567
IT SHOULDN'T BE
THIS HARD.

36:52.610 --> 36:54.339
(continues crying)

36:55.480 --> 36:57.675
ARIA, WAIT, WAIT.

36:57.710 --> 36:58.904
I LOVE YOU.

37:00.980 --> 37:02.971
(cries)

37:03.020 --> 37:04.487
**

37:04.520 --> 37:06.886
(beeping)

37:08.860 --> 37:10.714
WE LIKE YOUR PLAN.

37:10.760 --> 37:14.719
THOSE BITCHES ARE FINALLY
GONNA GET WHAT THEY DESERVE.

37:14.760 --> 37:17.729
I THOUGHT SHE'D STARTED
TO SEE THINGS OUR WAY,

37:17.760 --> 37:19.864
BUT SH E'D ALREADY
GONE ROGUE.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.731
SPENCER.

37:21.770 --> 37:25.308
(crying) YOU LET ME BELIEVE
THAT YOU WERE DEAD?

37:25.340 --> 37:27.638
WHAT WE HAD WAS REAL.

37:27.670 --> 37:29.479
I'VE BEEN PRETENDING
TO WORK WITH MONA

37:29.510 --> 37:32.343
SO I COULD KEEP YOU SAFE.

37:32.380 --> 37:34.473
I NEED YOU TO BELIEVE ME.

37:34.520 --> 37:37.444
IT CAN BE HARD TO KNOW
WHO TO TRUST,

37:37.480 --> 37:38.981
BUT YOU CAN'T FOOL
YOUR FRIENDS,

37:39.020 --> 37:40.578
AND THE GIRLS
WERE ON TO SPENCER.

37:40.620 --> 37:41.951
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED AT RADLEY,

37:41.990 --> 37:43.685
BUT SPENCER WENT IN THERE
AT ROCK BOTTOM,

37:43.720 --> 37:46.029
AND THEN SHE CAME OUT
LIKE A SHINY NEW PENNY.

37:46.060 --> 37:47.618
MONA ASKED SPENCER
TO JOIN THE A-TEAM

37:47.660 --> 37:49.525
THE NIGHT
OF THE MASQUERADE BALL.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.562
DID SPENCER FINALLY
TAKE HER UP ON IT?

37:51.600 --> 37:52.965
YEAH, BUT WHY NOW?

37:53.000 --> 37:54.968
THERE'S A WAY TO PROVE
THAT SPENCER'S STILL WITH US.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.299
AND IF MONA'S WATCHING,
IT WON'T PUT SPENCER AT RISK.

37:58.340 --> 38:01.776
(indistinct conversations)

38:01.810 --> 38:04.779
TRACKING A RED COAT IN A SEA
OF RED COATS IS TRICKY,

38:04.810 --> 38:06.869
BUT SPENCER FELL FOR IT.

38:10.350 --> 38:11.442
WHAT IS THIS?

38:11.490 --> 38:12.980
YOU FOLLOWED ME HERE.

38:13.020 --> 38:16.057
THAT MEANS YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO SHE IS EITHER.

38:16.090 --> 38:17.512
(gasps)

38:17.560 --> 38:18.652
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO SHE IS,

38:18.690 --> 38:19.782
THAT MEANS YOU'RE STILL
ONE OF US.

38:19.830 --> 38:21.491
WE WANT TO HELP YOU.

38:21.530 --> 38:23.020
THIS PARTY TOMORROW,
IT'S A SETUP.

38:23.060 --> 38:25.392
RED COAT JUST WANTS US ALL
TO BE TOGETHER.

38:25.430 --> 38:26.897
WHY? WH-WHAT'S SHE GONNA
DO TO US?

38:26.930 --> 38:28.397
I DON'T KNOW.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.658
BUT WE'RE NOT
GONNA LET IT HAPPEN.

38:30.700 --> 38:32.930
AS WORD
OF SPENCER'S PARTY SPREAD,

38:32.970 --> 38:35.530
THE BUGS CRAWLED OUT
OF THE WOODWORK.

38:35.580 --> 38:39.471
LIKE MOTHS TO A FLAME, EVERYONE
WAS FLUTTERING IN THE DARK.

38:39.510 --> 38:40.772
I'VE MISSED YOU.
(huffs)

38:40.810 --> 38:44.689
BUT JENNA FOUND HER WAY
WITH HER NEW SQUEEZE SHANA.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.585
THEY'LL ALL BE TOGETHER
THIS FRIDAY.

38:46.620 --> 38:48.611
YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

38:48.660 --> 38:52.824
YEAH. WHAT DID THE DOCTOR
SAY ABOUT YOUR EYES?

38:52.860 --> 38:56.091
UM, I'LL HAVE GOOD DAYS
AND BAD DAYS.

38:56.130 --> 38:59.691
EVENTUALLY,
THEY'LL ALL BE BAD.

38:59.730 --> 39:03.769
ON YOUR DARKEST DAYS,
YOU KNOW I'LL BE HERE FOR YOU.

39:05.810 --> 39:08.574
THE MISCHIEVOUS TWOSOME
BECAME A DEVIOUS THREESOME

39:08.610 --> 39:11.033
WHEN EMILY SPOTTED JENNA
AND SHANA

39:11.080 --> 39:12.377
WITH MELISSA_ HASTINGS.
(Jenna speaks lndlstlnctly)

39:12.410 --> 39:13.502
NO, I DO UNDERSTAND,

39:13.550 --> 39:15.745
BUT THOSE BITCHES ARE GONNA
BE AT THE LODGE AT 9:00.

39:15.780 --> 39:17.008
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

39:17.050 --> 39:18.517
(Jenna, Shana, and Melissa
speak indistinctly)

39:18.550 --> 39:21.451
**

39:21.490 --> 39:23.788
IT WAS TIME TO GET
THIS PARTY STARTED.

39:23.820 --> 39:26.084
SHE'S EXPECTING ALL OF YOU
TO BE HERE.

39:26.130 --> 39:27.984
AND WE WILL BE.

39:30.830 --> 39:34.698
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT SHE'S CAPABLE OF, SPENCER.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.766
TRUST ME. YOU DON'T WANT
TO DISAPPOINT HER.

39:37.800 --> 39:39.700
(helicopter blades whirring)

39:39.740 --> 39:43.176
(Mona) How far away are you?
It's safe for you to land.

39:43.210 --> 39:46.145
WITH SPENCER AND TOBY
BOTH ON THE INSIDE...

39:46.180 --> 39:48.000
GOING SOMEWHERE?

39:48.050 --> 39:50.109
THE GIRLS MANAGED TO GET
ONE STEP AHEAD OF ME.

39:50.150 --> 39:53.449
YOU ARE MAKING
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

39:53.490 --> 39:54.980
THAT'S NOT HOW WE SEE IT.

39:55.020 --> 39:57.989
BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE. YOU HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

39:58.020 --> 39:59.157
WE KNOW ENOUGH.

39:59.190 --> 40:00.748
(helicopter blades whirring)

40:00.790 --> 40:02.894
RED COAT WAS COMING IN
FOR A LANDING

40:02.930 --> 40:04.818
WHILE SPENCER AND TOBY
WAITED IN THE WINGS.

40:04.870 --> 40:06.895
REMEMBER WHY WE'RE HERE,
SPENCER.

40:06.930 --> 40:10.161
YOU SEE HER,
SHE DOESN'T SEE YOU.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.394
(clinks)

40:11.440 --> 40:14.432
BUT THERE WERE OTHERS
IN THE WOODS THAT NIGHT.

40:14.480 --> 40:17.438
(flames crackling)

40:18.950 --> 40:20.975
(fire whooshes)

40:21.010 --> 40:22.568
(crackling)

40:22.620 --> 40:23.769
(girl)
MONA, TRY YOUR PHONE.

40:23.820 --> 40:24.912
NOTHING.

40:24.950 --> 40:26.042
HOW CAN YOU NOT HAVE
A SIGNAL?

40:26.090 --> 40:27.182
WE SAW YOU MAKE A CALL.

40:27.220 --> 40:28.517
IT'S HER.
DON'T YOU GET IT?

40:28.560 --> 40:29.913
SHE CAN DO ANYTHING.
SHE'S EVERYWHERE,

40:29.960 --> 40:31.985
AND SHE'S NOWHERE.

40:32.030 --> 40:33.088
COME ON.
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

40:33.130 --> 40:34.825
(glass shatters)

40:36.560 --> 40:38.198
(gasps) OH!

40:38.230 --> 40:40.790
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE.
WE'RE ALL GONNA BURN.

40:40.830 --> 40:41.933
SHUT UP, MONA!

40:41.970 --> 40:44.097
I'M NEVER GONNA KNOW
WHO SHE WAS!

40:44.140 --> 40:45.960
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

40:46.010 --> 40:47.807
(flames crackling)

40:47.840 --> 40:50.707
RED COAT. I DON'T KNOW
WHO SHE IS, EITHER.

40:55.820 --> 40:56.912
(door opens)

40:58.920 --> 41:01.115
IT WAS HARD TO BE SURE
IN THE FOG,

41:01.150 --> 41:04.551
BUT RED COAT HAD
A FAMILIAR WAY ABOUT HER.

41:04.590 --> 41:05.659
ALI?

41:05.690 --> 41:09.091
AND WHOEVER
WAS WORKING IN THE DARK...

41:09.130 --> 41:10.222
(smack)
(man grunts)

41:10.260 --> 41:13.024
WANTED TOBY TO GO DOWN.

41:13.070 --> 41:15.561
(clinks)

41:15.600 --> 41:19.138
(crackling)

41:20.870 --> 41:24.101
NONE OF US INSIDE THE HOUSE
WOULD'VE SURVIVED THE FIRE...

41:24.140 --> 41:25.903
MM.

41:28.750 --> 41:29.944
(coughs)

41:29.980 --> 41:32.244
(glass shatters)
DID ANYONE SEE HER?

41:32.290 --> 41:33.780
SEE WHO?

41:33.820 --> 41:35.811
ALISON.
SHE PULLED ME OUT OF THERE.

41:35.860 --> 41:37.282
SHE PULLED US ALL OUT.

41:37.320 --> 41:38.821
NO.
YOU'RE HALLUCINATING.

41:38.860 --> 41:40.748
SHE WAS HERE.
I SWEAR IT.

41:40.790 --> 41:42.690
I SAW HER, TOO.

41:45.130 --> 41:47.189
SO DID I.

41:47.230 --> 41:51.098
ALI IS RED COAT.

41:51.140 --> 41:53.028
(flames crackle)

41:54.270 --> 41:58.036
SO ALL OF THIS STARTED
WHEN YOU WERE AT RADLEY?

41:58.080 --> 41:59.900
I MADE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL,

41:59.950 --> 42:02.839
AND SHE GAVE ME A WAY
IN AND OUT OF THAT PLACE.

42:02.880 --> 42:07.146
AT FIRST IT WAS FUN,
HAVING A PARTNER.

42:07.190 --> 42:08.885
BUT THEN THE GAME CHANGED.

42:08.920 --> 42:10.854
SHE STOLE YOU FROM ME.

42:10.890 --> 42:12.778
SO WHAT HAPPENED
THAT NIGHT?

42:12.830 --> 42:14.593
WERE YOU THERE
AT THE CEMETERY?

42:14.630 --> 42:16.154
DID YOU DRUG ME?
DID YOU TAKE ALI'S BODY?

42:16.200 --> 42:18.259
I DON'T KNOW
WHO DRUGGED YOU.

42:18.300 --> 42:21.167
BUT I WAS AT THE CEMETERY,
AND SO WAS RED COAT.

42:21.200 --> 42:23.168
HOW COULD YOU NOT SEE
WHO IT WAS?

42:23.200 --> 42:25.907
SHE WAS WEARING A MASK.

42:25.940 --> 42:30.877
SHE LOOKED JUST...
LIKE ALI.

42:30.910 --> 42:33.299
WELL, THAT'S... PROBABLY
WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT.

42:33.350 --> 42:35.818
IT--IT WASN'T ALI.
IT WAS A MASK.

42:35.850 --> 42:38.739
GUYS.

42:38.790 --> 42:40.314
OH, WAIT. IS THAT...

42:40.350 --> 42:43.353
SOMEONE HAD PULLED
DETECTIVE WILDEN'S SQUAD CAR

42:43.390 --> 42:44.948
FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE LAKE...

42:44.990 --> 42:46.423
(Wilden)
WE'RE NOT DONE HERE.

42:46.460 --> 42:50.089
(Mona) WITH VIDEO
OF THE HIT-ANEéRPN ON REPLAY.

42:50.130 --> 42:52.064
WE HAVE TO GET THIS
OUT OF HERE.

42:52.100 --> 42:54.967
(thud)

42:55.000 --> 42:56.137
(static crackles)

42:56.170 --> 42:57.364
WAIT. THERE'S MORE.

42:57.400 --> 42:59.630
IT'S JENNA.

42:59.670 --> 43:01.979
(girl) AND SHANA?
(girl) THEY KNOW WILDEN?

43:03.080 --> 43:04.809
GUYS?

43:04.850 --> 43:06.738
LOOK AT THE TRUNK.

43:06.780 --> 43:09.715
(cell phone alerts beeping
and chiming)

43:11.380 --> 43:12.688
(beep)

43:12.720 --> 43:14.085
"YOU'RE MINE NOW.

43:14.120 --> 43:15.382
KISSES."

43:15.420 --> 43:17.058
""A."

43:19.060 --> 43:21.028
(creaks)

43:21.060 --> 43:23.620
(all gasp)

43:23.660 --> 43:26.823
(thunderclap)
THE NIGHT'S EVENTS LEFT US
ALL WONDERING...

43:26.870 --> 43:28.963
(rustles)

43:32.810 --> 43:34.300
IS ALISON ALIVE?
