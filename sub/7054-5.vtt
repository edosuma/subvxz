WEBVTT

00:00.435 --> 00:01.688
<i>Previously on Fringe...</i>

00:01.849 --> 00:04.817
An unstable wormhole was
quarantined by Fringe Division.

00:04.897 --> 00:08.625
Citizens encased in quarantine amber
have been ruled legally dead.

00:08.761 --> 00:09.945
This is gonna sound nuts...

00:10.128 --> 00:12.560
When she was having her breakdown,
she kept on and on

00:12.658 --> 00:15.537
about how they were trying to make her
believe she was somebody else.

00:15.961 --> 00:17.048
What if she's telling the truth?

00:17.161 --> 00:20.297
- What if it's not the real her?
- That is nuts.

00:20.632 --> 00:22.694
You're right.

00:22.778 --> 00:23.862
How does she seem?

00:23.946 --> 00:25.230
Like Olivia Dunham.

00:25.314 --> 00:28.533
For all intents and purposes,
she is Agent Dunham.

00:28.617 --> 00:30.452
You're not
from this world, Olivia.

00:30.519 --> 00:31.603
You're not real.

00:31.670 --> 00:34.089
Real is just
a matter of perception.

00:34.156 --> 00:36.875
And I'm a part of you
that you have to hold on to.

00:36.959 --> 00:39.477
You can't forget
who you are, Olivia.

00:41.363 --> 00:45.032
You've been back with
Fringe Division for a week now?

00:45.084 --> 00:46.501
Uh... For eight days.

00:46.552 --> 00:49.304
Any headaches
or lingering symptoms...

00:49.371 --> 00:52.557
Mood swings, insomnia?

00:52.641 --> 00:53.808
No. Although
I do feel like

00:53.876 --> 00:56.878
I keep getting asked the same question
over and over again.

00:56.929 --> 00:58.396
Is that a lingering symptom?

00:58.481 --> 01:00.348
You are recovering from
a severe mental break,

01:00.399 --> 01:02.383
Agent Dunham...
I have to ask you these questions.

01:02.435 --> 01:03.818
Yeah.
I know.

01:03.886 --> 01:06.020
Please accept my apologies

01:06.071 --> 01:07.739
for the poking and prodding,
Agent Dunham.

01:07.823 --> 01:09.991
Uh, Mr. Secretary.

01:10.058 --> 01:11.359
You look well.

01:11.410 --> 01:13.027
I am.
Good as new.

01:13.078 --> 01:14.896
Did you get the dossier
I sent over?

01:14.947 --> 01:16.063
Yes, sir.

01:16.115 --> 01:17.499
So you really believe

01:17.566 --> 01:20.368
that the other Olivia Dunham
can cross between universes.

01:20.419 --> 01:22.537
It would appear so.

01:22.588 --> 01:25.340
Thus far, we've developed
some means of our own,

01:25.407 --> 01:27.425
but each of them
has dangerous side effects.

01:27.510 --> 01:32.514
But it seems their Olivia can
travel between worlds safely,

01:32.581 --> 01:36.534
which is the real reason
you're here today.

01:36.602 --> 01:40.221
We believe you may be
able to do the same.

01:40.272 --> 01:42.256
How would I be able to do that?

01:42.308 --> 01:45.610
I don't know... yet.

01:45.694 --> 01:47.345
But with your permission,

01:47.413 --> 01:50.264
we'd like to put you through
a series of experiments

01:50.316 --> 01:52.484
to see if we're right.

01:56.238 --> 01:58.873
I'm sure you understand...

01:58.941 --> 02:02.377
what this would mean
to our cause.

02:02.444 --> 02:06.047
We'd be able to defend ourselves
against the other side.

02:08.383 --> 02:12.554
But... I know you've
been through a lot, Olivia.

02:12.621 --> 02:16.808
So if you're not up to it,
you should just say so.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:32.641 --> 02:35.360
You can take as many pills
as you want.

02:35.444 --> 02:38.413
I'm not going anywhere.

02:38.480 --> 02:40.281
You're not here.

02:40.332 --> 02:43.868
Look, I understand why
you agreed to take the test.

02:43.953 --> 02:46.170
You just want things
to go back to normal,

02:46.255 --> 02:48.873
to be the Olivia
that you think you should be,

02:48.958 --> 02:50.792
but unfortunately,
that's not gonna happen.

02:50.843 --> 02:52.877
Because you're not their Olivia.

02:52.962 --> 02:55.263
And you can keep on telling
yourself that you're fine,

02:55.330 --> 02:57.215
but you're not fine.

02:57.299 --> 02:59.300
You're not sleeping.

02:59.351 --> 03:01.970
And I'm not
a lingering symptom.

03:02.021 --> 03:05.356
You can't ignore me.

03:40.593 --> 03:42.260
All right, easy.

03:43.896 --> 03:46.213
- Got it?
- Yep.

03:46.265 --> 03:47.765
Careful.

03:47.850 --> 03:49.767
I said careful!

03:54.657 --> 03:56.824
Have your gun?

03:56.892 --> 03:59.060
Okay, ready?

03:59.111 --> 04:00.895
Uhh!
I got it.

04:00.946 --> 04:03.414
I got it.

04:11.624 --> 04:14.375
- He's not breathing.
- He's dead.

04:14.426 --> 04:16.543
No, he's not dead.
Gimme... Gimme the syringe.

04:16.595 --> 04:19.514
Gimme the syringe!

04:22.351 --> 04:25.470
Come on, buddy, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

04:31.259 --> 04:32.860
Nothing.

04:38.100 --> 04:39.100
Come on!

04:39.151 --> 04:40.735
Come on!

04:40.786 --> 04:42.904
<i>Warning.</i>

04:42.971 --> 04:44.706
<i>Quarantine area breach.</i>

04:44.773 --> 04:46.624
The cops are gonna
be here any minute.

04:46.709 --> 04:48.242
- We gotta move.
- Breathe!

04:48.293 --> 04:50.078
Come on, breathe!
Come on!

04:53.448 --> 04:55.750
Okay, you're okay.
Cut him out, cut him out!

04:55.801 --> 04:57.085
- You okay?
- Yeah...

04:57.136 --> 04:59.387
Okay, give me a minute.
We're gonna cut you out, okay?

05:04.793 --> 05:08.096
Come on, pick it up!

05:10.983 --> 05:12.266
Wilner.
Wilner!

05:12.317 --> 05:14.268
- Oh, God.
- Here.

05:14.319 --> 05:15.603
Pull.
Come on, come on, pull.

05:15.654 --> 05:18.656
Just pull. Come on!
Pull, come on, pull!

05:18.741 --> 05:21.475
Come on, man, come on,
come on, pull!

05:24.246 --> 05:26.414
Help me.
Please!

05:26.481 --> 05:28.249
Wilner, I'm sorry.

05:28.316 --> 05:30.334
- He's my brother.
- No! Please!

05:30.419 --> 05:32.503
Don't leave me!

06:00.586 --> 06:02.837
Homemade laser knife.

06:02.922 --> 06:06.124
It's clean.
There's no fingerprints.

06:06.175 --> 06:09.294
Pretty sophisticated tech
for looters.

06:09.345 --> 06:10.778
Well, you gotta hand it to 'em.

06:10.846 --> 06:13.031
No one's ever removed anything
from the quarantine zone,

06:13.098 --> 06:14.065
yet they keep trying.

06:14.133 --> 06:17.302
Lotta purses
and wallets in there.

06:17.353 --> 06:18.937
Like Cary Grant said...

06:19.004 --> 06:21.839
"The stuff
that dreams are made of."

06:21.891 --> 06:23.358
Oh...

06:23.442 --> 06:25.009
You got something?

06:25.060 --> 06:26.344
I don't know yet.

06:26.395 --> 06:28.696
I'll be right back.

06:30.399 --> 06:32.450
- Hey.
- Well, look who's here.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.985
Yeah.
Traffic.

06:34.036 --> 06:35.519
Third time this week.

06:35.571 --> 06:37.155
You gotta stop taking
the Nixon Parkway.

06:37.206 --> 06:38.623
Yeah.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.959
You okay?
You seem a little run down.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.660
Oh, yeah.
Frank's on assignment,

06:42.711 --> 06:45.046
and I never sleep
very well when he's away.

06:45.130 --> 06:47.665
So you gonna
bring me up to speed?

06:47.716 --> 06:50.552
<i>In 1989, these isolated
tears in the fabric of our universe</i>

06:50.636 --> 06:52.536
<i>began to increase in frequency.</i>

06:52.588 --> 06:54.806
<i>Some of them expanded
into micro black holes</i>

06:54.873 --> 06:56.540
<i>with devastating consequences.</i>

06:56.592 --> 06:57.809
<i>To contain these events,</i>

06:57.876 --> 06:59.861
<i>scientists designed
a quarantine protocol</i>

06:59.929 --> 07:01.646
<i>using a chemical substance,
Amber 31422.</i>

07:01.713 --> 07:03.047
All right, just fast forward.

07:03.098 --> 07:04.482
What are you looking for?

07:04.549 --> 07:06.601
I was just watching this
a couple of weeks ago.

07:06.685 --> 07:09.087
I just... remember something
a little differently.

07:09.154 --> 07:10.538
Right there. Freeze it.

07:10.606 --> 07:12.556
Thanks.

07:14.610 --> 07:17.061
Four years ago,
this station was sealed.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.665
Now it looks like
we have a new addition.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.367
Meet our thief.

07:22.418 --> 07:24.902
Must have gotten caught
in the reseal.

07:24.954 --> 07:28.623
Mark Wilmer.
Couple counts of burglary.

07:28.707 --> 07:30.708
You know, breaking into amber

07:30.759 --> 07:32.794
seems awfully ambitious
for a small-time crook.

07:36.915 --> 07:40.602
Something tells me
he wasn't after purses.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.602
So this is where
the powerful hide out.

07:58.654 --> 08:01.155
Just those that need
to do some thinking

08:01.240 --> 08:02.940
before they head home.

08:02.992 --> 08:05.493
Thank you for meeting me.

08:08.414 --> 08:10.081
I understand you're
working on a case...

08:10.132 --> 08:11.582
A man removed from amber.

08:11.634 --> 08:13.117
Franklin Street Station.

08:13.168 --> 08:14.886
We're trying to determine
why someone

08:14.953 --> 08:17.805
would go to all that
trouble to steal him.

08:17.890 --> 08:21.426
When I first developed the amber,

08:21.477 --> 08:24.962
the universe was degrading
at an alarming rate.

08:25.014 --> 08:27.949
People were becoming
afraid to leave their homes.

08:28.017 --> 08:31.102
I remember the first time
we instigated the protocol.

08:31.153 --> 08:37.125
It was October 17, 1989.

08:37.192 --> 08:39.344
I remember I woke...

08:39.410 --> 08:41.496
particularly happy that day.

08:41.580 --> 08:45.016
And then there was
the breach at Harvard Yard.

08:45.084 --> 08:46.284
If we hadn't contained it,

08:46.335 --> 08:48.386
half of Boston
would have been swallowed up.

08:48.454 --> 08:52.957
63 civilians were trapped
in amber that day...

08:53.008 --> 08:55.693
and... hundreds since.

08:55.761 --> 08:57.128
It sickens me.

08:57.196 --> 08:59.464
Sir...

09:01.383 --> 09:03.851
It's a tragic,
but a small price to pay

09:03.936 --> 09:05.820
for the greater good.

09:05.888 --> 09:07.671
People understand that.

09:07.723 --> 09:09.440
Perhaps.

09:12.778 --> 09:15.563
But if they were to find out

09:15.647 --> 09:19.200
that the amber victims could be
removed and resuscitated,

09:19.284 --> 09:22.453
I'm afraid the outcry
would be akin to revolt.

09:22.521 --> 09:25.206
Quarantine victims are alive?

09:25.290 --> 09:27.575
Theoretically.

09:27.659 --> 09:29.327
But to remove them

09:29.378 --> 09:32.380
would weaken the structural
integrity of the amber.

09:34.917 --> 09:37.735
We'll recover them before
anyone finds out, sir.

09:39.988 --> 09:43.057
Oh, and another thing.

09:43.142 --> 09:45.676
Olivia Dunham has agreed
to submit to the tests

09:45.728 --> 09:47.428
developed by Science Division.

09:47.513 --> 09:51.015
As I've said,
these tests are stressful.

09:51.066 --> 09:52.984
If she becomes unstable
in any way...

09:53.051 --> 09:56.154
If I see any unusual behavior,
I'll let you know.

10:00.192 --> 10:05.163
Nature doesn't recognize
good and evil, Phillip.

10:05.230 --> 10:09.450
Nature only recognizes
balance and imbalance.

10:12.121 --> 10:16.758
I intend to restore balance
to our world.

10:16.842 --> 10:18.876
Whatever it takes.

10:23.132 --> 10:25.383
Really?
You never did that before?

10:25.434 --> 10:27.885
- Make my own Popsicles?
- Yeah.

10:27.936 --> 10:31.439
My mom used to have
these plastic molds,

10:31.523 --> 10:33.591
and you'd pour fruit juice
into them

10:33.642 --> 10:35.476
and then stick them
in the freezer.

10:35.561 --> 10:36.727
- My mom...
- Mm?

10:36.779 --> 10:38.095
Made me get her cigarettes.

10:38.147 --> 10:39.430
- Aw!
- Aw!

10:39.481 --> 10:42.567
Ah. So who's
the Popsicle?

10:48.490 --> 10:49.907
Joshua Rose.

10:49.958 --> 10:53.661
I worked his case with
Fringe Division four years ago.

10:53.745 --> 10:55.329
He's a bank robber.

10:55.414 --> 10:56.631
Well, why would Fringe Division

10:56.715 --> 10:58.166
be appointed
to investigate a robber?

10:58.250 --> 10:59.801
Rose used some kind of device

10:59.885 --> 11:01.285
that allowed him
to access the vaults

11:01.336 --> 11:03.421
without setting off
the bank alarms.

11:03.472 --> 11:05.590
But what it also did was cause
molecular degradation.

11:05.641 --> 11:07.141
Man-made breaches.

11:07.226 --> 11:08.759
We studied that case
back at the academy.

11:08.811 --> 11:10.895
You guys had to quarantine what...
Half a dozen areas?

11:10.962 --> 11:12.763
One very every job Rose pulled.

11:12.815 --> 11:16.067
The bank above Franklin Station
was Rose's last job.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.685
He got caught
in the quarantine.

11:17.769 --> 11:19.770
Now, it's possible
that he was taken out

11:19.822 --> 11:21.656
in order to be revived.

11:21.740 --> 11:23.474
Revived?

11:23.525 --> 11:25.476
What I'm about to tell you
is classified.

11:25.527 --> 11:27.745
The people entombed in amber

11:27.812 --> 11:29.580
are in a state
of suspended animation.

11:29.648 --> 11:31.916
Sir.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.868
If people knew
that their loved ones

11:33.952 --> 11:35.036
were still alive in there...

11:35.120 --> 11:36.754
I understand, Agent Dunham.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.322
Which is why we need
to recover Rose,

11:38.373 --> 11:40.007
whatever state he's in,
as soon as possible.

11:40.092 --> 11:43.845
He had an apartment that
was sealed after he was ambered.

11:43.929 --> 11:46.013
Start there.

11:57.359 --> 12:00.144
Shh, shh, shh.
Just rest.

12:00.195 --> 12:03.614
You'll be fine.

12:12.875 --> 12:15.209
He just needs time to recover,
Danielle.

12:24.503 --> 12:26.871
My first partner got caught

12:26.939 --> 12:28.673
in an amber quarantine
in Boston.

12:28.724 --> 12:31.475
His little girl
just turned six last week.

12:43.071 --> 12:44.989
If I get ambered...

12:45.056 --> 12:46.890
Just leave me in there.

12:51.496 --> 12:54.665
Does that feel familiar?

12:54.733 --> 12:57.735
Two people
who look exactly alike.

13:01.790 --> 13:03.741
You find anything?

13:06.261 --> 13:09.046
What do we know
about Rose's family?

13:09.097 --> 13:11.015
Never married.

13:11.082 --> 13:12.800
No kids.
Parents are dead.

13:12.884 --> 13:15.603
He has a brother Matthew,
an accountant.

13:15.687 --> 13:17.087
Broyles said
he was very cooperative

13:17.139 --> 13:18.556
in their investigation.

13:18.607 --> 13:22.059
Okay. Uh, maybe we should
talk to him again.

13:26.648 --> 13:28.098
Hey, guys.

13:36.107 --> 13:37.959
Jackpot.

13:43.131 --> 13:44.832
Anybody recognize
any of this stuff?

13:44.916 --> 13:48.586
Some of it.
Ion lasers.

13:48.637 --> 13:51.422
Pneumo drills.
Some kinda gas.

13:51.473 --> 13:52.956
Looks like he
was trying to build

13:53.008 --> 13:54.792
some kind of
negative matter ring.

13:54.843 --> 13:56.560
Okay, Mr. Wizard.

13:56.628 --> 13:57.979
Some of us don't
have a fancy degree.

13:58.063 --> 14:00.231
Creates high frequency
vibrations.

14:00.298 --> 14:03.651
Which could weaken the atomic
structure of the bank's walls.

14:03.735 --> 14:06.470
That would explain how Rose
was able to get inside.

14:06.521 --> 14:08.773
- He walked through walls?
- It's possible.

14:08.824 --> 14:11.025
Okay, now I know you
pulled that outta your ass.

14:11.109 --> 14:14.111
Shh!
Listen.

14:17.666 --> 14:18.666
Go! Now!

14:33.492 --> 14:35.877
- This might sting a bit.
- Okay.

14:35.961 --> 14:38.496
Dinner is on me tonight, Liv.

14:38.547 --> 14:40.014
Evvia, Pimlico.
Whatever you want.

14:40.099 --> 14:41.683
Big spender.

14:41.767 --> 14:43.334
What's the occasion?

14:43.385 --> 14:45.470
Olivia saved our lives.

14:45.521 --> 14:47.272
She heard the bomb
before it went off,

14:47.339 --> 14:49.941
and we had enough time
to get out the apartment.

14:50.008 --> 14:53.061
- Good work, Agent.
- Thank you, sir.

14:53.145 --> 14:54.529
You I.D. the the symbol
on those tanks?

14:54.613 --> 14:57.615
Ferrocene. It's a compound
used in negative matter rings.

14:57.683 --> 14:59.567
Oh ho!
What did I say?

14:59.652 --> 15:01.069
Anyone ever tell you
gloating isn't attractive?

15:02.321 --> 15:03.738
Hold still, Agent Francis.

15:06.826 --> 15:07.859
Oh!

15:07.910 --> 15:10.027
That looks pretty bad.

15:10.079 --> 15:12.530
Why don't you take this off?
I'll get the doctor.

15:12.581 --> 15:14.299
Okay.

15:33.486 --> 15:35.720
Liv?

15:37.656 --> 15:38.907
Soon as we're done,

15:38.991 --> 15:40.942
we're gonna go talk
to Joshua Rose's brother.

15:41.010 --> 15:42.944
Okay.

16:02.915 --> 16:05.466
You got it?
I'll be right back, all right?

16:05.551 --> 16:07.635
- I'll be right back.
- Matthew Rose?

16:07.720 --> 16:09.304
Yeah.
What can I do for you?

16:09.388 --> 16:11.088
Agent Lee, Fringe Division.

16:11.140 --> 16:12.423
This is Agent Dunham.

16:12.474 --> 16:13.691
What's goin' on?

16:13.759 --> 16:15.360
What we're about to ask you
is classified.

16:15.427 --> 16:17.428
It's about your brother
Joshua...

16:17.479 --> 16:19.898
Any idea about his whereabouts?

16:19.949 --> 16:21.933
You know, four years ago
you people told me

16:21.984 --> 16:25.286
that he was trapped in amber.

16:25.371 --> 16:27.121
You telling me you were wrong?

16:27.206 --> 16:30.041
We can't go into detail.

16:30.108 --> 16:33.328
But if we were wrong,
would he contact you?

16:33.412 --> 16:35.713
My... My brother...

16:35.781 --> 16:38.166
ripped families apart, okay?

16:38.250 --> 16:39.717
Mothers and husbands
trapped in amber

16:39.785 --> 16:41.803
because of the crimes
he committed.

16:41.887 --> 16:44.472
He'd know better
than to contact me.

16:44.557 --> 16:47.175
Do you have any idea
what it was like for me

16:47.259 --> 16:49.510
when Joshua's face started
showing up on the news?

16:49.595 --> 16:51.980
I mean, every time I went
to the market, to a movie,

16:52.064 --> 16:53.798
take my kids to little league...

16:53.849 --> 16:55.633
People would look at me
and see him.

16:55.684 --> 16:57.969
That must have been
very difficult for you.

17:00.606 --> 17:02.306
You know,
just because we look alike,

17:02.358 --> 17:05.242
it doesn't mean we have
anything in common.

17:07.445 --> 17:09.696
We appreciate your time,
Mr. Rose.

17:09.781 --> 17:12.148
If you hear anything...

17:13.752 --> 17:16.421
Yeah.

17:19.258 --> 17:23.493
All this time I thought my
brother was a pain in the ass.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.048
Oh...

17:27.132 --> 17:29.684
Gotta go to the D.O.D.
They're ready for me.

17:29.768 --> 17:31.019
You sure you're up for this?

17:31.103 --> 17:33.688
I mean, you just
started back to work.

17:33.772 --> 17:35.690
Yeah.

17:35.774 --> 17:38.693
I can handle it.
But thank you...

17:38.777 --> 17:40.612
Mom.

17:59.131 --> 18:00.581
Where's Danielle?

18:00.666 --> 18:03.301
She, uh...
She's at the store.

18:03.368 --> 18:05.253
She's gonna be back
in a minute.

18:14.346 --> 18:16.714
I don't know
how to say this, but...

18:16.765 --> 18:19.017
You, uh...

18:19.068 --> 18:21.769
You came to the bank
to try and stop me,

18:21.854 --> 18:23.938
but you were too late.

18:26.224 --> 18:27.775
I mean, I didn't know.

18:27.860 --> 18:30.078
I couldn't know
you were coming.

18:33.615 --> 18:36.000
You were trying to stop me
from robbing a bank,

18:36.068 --> 18:39.537
and I ended up stealing your life.

18:39.588 --> 18:42.173
But you're free now.

18:42.240 --> 18:46.077
It took me longer than I thought,
but I never gave up.

19:17.609 --> 19:19.777
How are our boys?

19:19.828 --> 19:21.746
They're so big,
you're not gonna believe it.

19:21.797 --> 19:24.415
They're giants.

19:29.605 --> 19:33.374
It's okay.
It's okay.

19:35.394 --> 19:37.645
Genetically, you're exact replicas,

19:37.730 --> 19:41.065
you and the other Olivia.

19:41.133 --> 19:42.850
Which means, theoretically,

19:42.935 --> 19:45.353
you both should be capable
of the same thing.

19:45.437 --> 19:46.804
In the isolation tank,

19:46.855 --> 19:49.857
you'll be freed
from sensory distractions,

19:49.942 --> 19:51.826
and so the part of your brain

19:51.910 --> 19:55.413
which enables you
to travel between universes

19:55.480 --> 19:57.365
should be more accessible.

19:57.449 --> 19:59.917
And we will help
the process along

19:59.985 --> 20:02.920
by giving you a number
of psychotropic drugs.

20:02.988 --> 20:04.672
There's a speaker in the tank,

20:04.757 --> 20:06.257
so you'll be able to hear us.

20:06.324 --> 20:09.343
And we'll be
monitoring you closely.

20:09.428 --> 20:11.546
- Okay.
- Ready?

20:11.630 --> 20:14.832
Just like riding the roller coaster
at Coney Island, right?

20:34.653 --> 20:36.020
Close it.

20:44.196 --> 20:46.964
Olivia, can you hear me?

20:48.967 --> 20:52.036
We'll start the drugs now.

21:04.016 --> 21:05.650
Now we wait.

21:17.279 --> 21:19.614
It's not working.

21:22.367 --> 21:24.502
Increase the doses.

21:24.569 --> 21:29.373
5,000 milligrams Neurontin,
2,000 Elavil.

21:29.424 --> 21:30.758
Sir, are you really...

21:30.843 --> 21:33.294
Only those who risk
going too far

21:33.378 --> 21:35.930
find out how far they can go.

21:37.382 --> 21:38.382
Do it.

21:58.270 --> 22:00.404
Oh, hell!

22:00.455 --> 22:01.956
Uh...

22:02.040 --> 22:03.958
Her heart rate is 183.

22:04.042 --> 22:05.576
Blood pressure is falling.

22:26.148 --> 22:28.266
Cameron.

22:30.552 --> 22:32.970
I told you not
to touch anything.

22:41.980 --> 22:44.148
I went somewhere.

22:44.199 --> 22:46.317
To a gift shop.
There was a boy.

22:47.786 --> 22:50.755
It worked!

22:50.822 --> 22:53.708
You crossed over.

23:04.213 --> 23:06.247
Makes sense now, doesn't it?

23:07.967 --> 23:10.585
Why they needed you to take
their test voluntarily.

23:10.636 --> 23:15.256
Why they needed you to believe
that you were their Olivia.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.651
They know you can cross over.

23:26.736 --> 23:28.470
You've done it before.

23:28.537 --> 23:31.790
That's how you ended up
here in the first place.

23:43.586 --> 23:46.671
- Mom. Hey.
- Hi.

23:46.756 --> 23:48.640
Come in.

23:48.724 --> 23:49.758
It's Tuesday.

23:49.809 --> 23:51.125
Yeah.

23:51.177 --> 23:53.311
Oh!
Lunch.

23:53.396 --> 23:56.481
I'm sorry.
It just slipped my mind.

23:56.565 --> 23:58.099
It's just been
really hectic and...

23:58.150 --> 24:00.652
Yeah.
You know.

24:00.736 --> 24:03.271
Frank does most of
the real cleaning around here.

24:03.322 --> 24:04.739
He's still away.

24:04.807 --> 24:06.107
He's still in north Texas

24:06.158 --> 24:10.495
trying to put a stop to
that smallpox outbreak...

24:10.579 --> 24:13.982
Olive...
Is everything okay?

24:23.325 --> 24:27.128
Mom, I'm just tired,
and I keep seeing...

24:27.179 --> 24:28.997
I knew a pair of
twins in high school...

24:29.065 --> 24:30.899
Nina and Gina.

24:30.966 --> 24:33.151
One of them was always so much
brighter than the other one,

24:33.219 --> 24:35.837
but they both managed
to get straight As.

24:35.888 --> 24:38.423
I'll give you one guess
how they did that.

24:41.510 --> 24:42.894
- Olivia.
- Yeah.

24:42.978 --> 24:47.866
I asked you when is he
coming back in town?

24:47.950 --> 24:49.951
Mom, I've gotta go.

24:50.018 --> 24:51.786
Um...
I'm sorry.

24:51.854 --> 24:54.706
Do you mind if you...
If you let yourself out?

25:00.320 --> 25:01.937
Sir?

25:01.988 --> 25:05.440
Uh...
They switched.

25:05.492 --> 25:07.526
- Who?
- The twins.

25:07.610 --> 25:10.078
When we spoke
to Matthew Rose today,

25:10.146 --> 25:12.698
when he was talking
about Joshua's crimes,

25:12.782 --> 25:16.668
he wasn't angry or...
Or upset.

25:16.753 --> 25:18.670
He was... ashamed.

25:18.755 --> 25:20.255
I... It wasn't like
he was embarrassed.

25:20.323 --> 25:22.257
It was more like he was guilty.

25:22.325 --> 25:23.491
You think Joshua Rose

25:23.543 --> 25:25.177
was pretending to be
his brother.

25:25.261 --> 25:28.347
I think the man we spoke to today
committed those crimes.

25:28.431 --> 25:30.766
I think that they switched on us.

25:32.302 --> 25:34.770
What is this about?

25:42.695 --> 25:44.846
Identical twins
have the same DNA.

25:44.898 --> 25:49.117
But fingerprints and retinas
are unique.

25:49.185 --> 25:51.787
He's who he says he is.
He's Matthew Rose.

25:51.854 --> 25:54.289
No. Something's not right.

25:54.357 --> 25:58.026
Dunham, it was just a hunch.

25:58.077 --> 26:00.028
They switched again.

26:00.079 --> 26:01.863
- Liv...
- I'll prove it to you.

26:01.915 --> 26:04.166
Dunham.

26:08.555 --> 26:10.222
You switched with your brother.

26:11.507 --> 26:12.641
What are you talking about?

26:12.708 --> 26:14.092
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

26:14.177 --> 26:15.344
- Olivia.
- Hang on.

26:15.395 --> 26:17.346
Okay, we went to your
house yesterday.

26:17.397 --> 26:19.064
What did we talk about?

26:19.148 --> 26:20.399
What?

26:20.483 --> 26:21.567
At your house.

26:21.651 --> 26:25.153
What did we talk about?

26:32.495 --> 26:36.398
Your partner
did most of the talking.

26:36.449 --> 26:38.834
I told you how hard it was
for me and my family

26:38.901 --> 26:40.335
when Joshua was robbing banks.

26:40.403 --> 26:42.037
He told him.

26:42.088 --> 26:43.755
What we looked like,
what we talked about.

26:43.840 --> 26:46.041
They're in this together.
His brother told him.

26:46.092 --> 26:48.210
- Dunham.
- They're messing with us. They switched.

26:48.261 --> 26:49.461
Dunham.

26:49.545 --> 26:51.346
Outside.

26:57.437 --> 26:58.586
He's lying.

26:58.638 --> 27:00.105
And you can't prove
that I'm wrong.

27:00.189 --> 27:02.140
We can't prove
you're right either.

27:02.225 --> 27:03.475
- Liv...
- They're twins.

27:03.559 --> 27:04.693
Are you telling me

27:04.760 --> 27:05.944
that it's not in the realm
of possibility

27:06.029 --> 27:07.529
that they took
each other's place?

27:07.596 --> 27:11.950
Look, even if you're right,
we can't hold him on a hunch.

27:13.936 --> 27:16.989
Colonel, you've got
a visitor upstairs.

27:22.745 --> 27:24.963
Colonel Broyles,
I'm not sure that you remember me.

27:25.048 --> 27:26.999
Of course, Mrs. Dunham.

27:30.053 --> 27:31.803
What can I do for you?

27:33.289 --> 27:36.308
Olivia would be furious
with me, but...

27:36.392 --> 27:38.844
I think she went back
to work too soon.

27:38.928 --> 27:41.813
She just hasn't been
herself and...

27:41.898 --> 27:44.983
I'm worried that
there's something wrong.

27:51.741 --> 27:52.974
Hey.

27:53.026 --> 27:54.826
You okay?

27:54.911 --> 27:57.579
I mean, that depends.
Do you believe me?

27:58.865 --> 28:00.749
Break-in at Langdon chemical
two weeks ago.

28:00.816 --> 28:03.985
- Guess what they stole?
- Three tanks of ferrocene.

28:04.037 --> 28:06.154
Who uses ferrocene again?

28:06.205 --> 28:08.757
So Joshua Rose
is planning another heist.

28:10.326 --> 28:12.294
Uh...
Sir.

28:17.166 --> 28:19.334
Lee, go check it out.
Take Francis.

28:19.385 --> 28:21.436
Oh... D...
Don't do this to me.

28:21.504 --> 28:23.438
Please don't take me
off the case.

28:23.506 --> 28:26.308
I think you've been
pushed too hard.

28:26.359 --> 28:28.143
- Go.
- Sir, I'm not crazy.

28:28.194 --> 28:29.978
- I know I'm right about this.
- Dunham...

28:30.029 --> 28:32.447
If I could just
follow it through, I...

28:32.515 --> 28:35.517
Dunham, go home.

28:56.395 --> 28:59.197
<i>- How'd it go?</i>
- They know.

28:59.264 --> 29:01.316
One of the agents,
she knows, man.

29:01.400 --> 29:02.467
<i>She knows it was you
who spoke to her at the house</i>

29:02.535 --> 29:04.035
<i>- and we switched.</i>
- But they let you go?

29:04.103 --> 29:05.987
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:06.072 --> 29:08.206
Matty, are you being followed?

29:08.273 --> 29:10.325
I don't see anyone.

29:10.409 --> 29:11.943
You wouldn't see anybody.
That's the point.

29:11.994 --> 29:13.545
What are we gonna do?

29:13.612 --> 29:16.414
Just, um...

29:16.465 --> 29:18.416
Run some errands.

29:18.467 --> 29:20.118
Go get a cup of tea.

29:20.169 --> 29:21.836
<i>Just don't come home yet.
I need a couple of hours.</i>

29:21.921 --> 29:23.621
<i>- I'll take care of this.</i>
- How?

29:23.673 --> 29:25.957
Just do what I said.

29:28.961 --> 29:30.395
Wasn't supposed to be
like this.

29:30.462 --> 29:33.565
They weren't supposed
to be this close.

29:33.632 --> 29:36.735
Look, I'm doing my best here...
You know that.

29:36.802 --> 29:39.487
Do you know what it was
like for him?

29:39.572 --> 29:42.691
In the amber?
Did he tell you?

29:42.775 --> 29:44.642
Well, he told me.

29:44.694 --> 29:46.778
He was aware of every moment.

29:46.829 --> 29:49.480
His mind was stuck
in the last thought he had

29:49.532 --> 29:51.616
before he was trapped.

29:51.667 --> 29:56.004
This horrible feeling of fear...
And loss.

29:56.072 --> 29:58.656
Wondering about his family,
how we would get along.

29:58.708 --> 30:01.593
Can you imagine that?

30:01.660 --> 30:03.011
I have a plan.

30:03.095 --> 30:05.496
Oh. What?
You gonna rob a bank?

30:05.548 --> 30:09.167
One last score to get lost
and stay lost, Joshua?

30:09.218 --> 30:11.636
If you really cared about him,
you would turn yourself in,

30:11.687 --> 30:15.356
because that is
the only way out of this.

30:29.538 --> 30:31.522
Oh, nice goal!

30:31.574 --> 30:33.792
Whoo!

30:48.279 --> 30:51.092
Agent Farnsworth, would you mind
taking a look at something for me?

30:51.177 --> 30:54.179
If Joshua Rose
was about to hit another bank,

30:54.230 --> 30:56.397
where would it be,
given his profile and M.O.?

30:56.482 --> 30:58.382
I ran that scenario
for Agent Lee an hour ago.

30:58.434 --> 30:59.684
I understand,
but would you mind

30:59.735 --> 31:02.437
taking another look for me?

31:04.089 --> 31:07.242
There are 37 likely targets
based on that criteria.

31:07.326 --> 31:09.327
Okay, what assumptions
did you make?

31:09.394 --> 31:11.446
Assuming that Joshua Rose
was taken out of the amber,

31:11.530 --> 31:13.081
necessary parameters
would include

31:13.165 --> 31:15.233
a subterranean vault,
a minimum of $50,000,

31:15.284 --> 31:17.535
- proper getaway routes...
- Wait... Sorry.

31:17.586 --> 31:19.504
Assuming that Joshua
was removed from the amber?

31:19.571 --> 31:22.257
We know that he was
taken out of the amber.

31:22.341 --> 31:24.542
We know that someone
was taken from the amber.

31:24.593 --> 31:25.927
Joshua's a twin.

31:26.011 --> 31:27.879
There's a 50% chance that
his brother was in the amber

31:27.930 --> 31:29.514
and that Joshua broke him out.

31:29.581 --> 31:30.965
And Joshua
is a brilliant criminal

31:31.050 --> 31:34.769
with expertise in breaking into
impenetrable areas.

31:34.854 --> 31:36.387
Matthew is an accountant.

31:36.438 --> 31:37.806
Yes.

31:37.890 --> 31:40.308
Okay, so if it was Matthew
who was in the amber,

31:40.392 --> 31:42.277
then Joshua's M.O.
may have changed.

31:42.361 --> 31:45.113
I don't follow your logic.

31:45.197 --> 31:47.065
Okay. I think I spoke
to Joshua yesterday.

31:47.132 --> 31:48.933
He was clearly ashamed.

31:48.984 --> 31:51.269
I mean, if he spent
the past four years

31:51.320 --> 31:54.489
living with the guilt of
trapping his brother in amber,

31:54.573 --> 31:56.658
then he's not gonna want
to hurt people like that again.

31:56.742 --> 31:59.577
Less human traffic.
A remote area.

31:59.628 --> 32:01.579
Reduced collateral damage.

32:01.630 --> 32:04.132
That would narrow the list
of likely targets

32:04.216 --> 32:07.418
down to three...
Three banks.

33:33.328 --> 33:35.329
Anomalous energy
signature detected.

33:35.381 --> 33:36.514
Class two breach.

33:36.599 --> 33:37.999
Where's the location?

33:38.050 --> 33:40.334
Parameters match events
from 2006.

33:40.386 --> 33:44.022
79% probability it was
caused by Joshua Rose.

33:44.106 --> 33:45.773
I need a location.

33:45.841 --> 33:47.192
Riverdale Mutual.
The Bronx.

33:47.276 --> 33:48.610
Let's go, people.

33:48.677 --> 33:49.777
She was right.

33:49.845 --> 33:52.013
Who?

33:52.064 --> 33:53.815
Agent Dunham.

34:15.304 --> 34:18.223
I want science
and risk reports now!

34:18.306 --> 34:20.808
That's Olivia's car.

34:20.876 --> 34:22.427
Chief!

34:22.511 --> 34:25.063
Molecular degradation
is increasing.

34:25.147 --> 34:27.398
We're looking at
a 200-meter quarantine.

34:27.483 --> 34:30.150
Set a perimeter.
Best way in is through the main entrance.

34:30.217 --> 34:32.570
I want three canisters
in the main lobby.

34:32.655 --> 34:34.722
A three-point spread
with dispersion tubes

34:34.773 --> 34:38.493
to the basement
and the second floor.

34:38.560 --> 34:40.561
We got a busted lock
on the subway gate.

34:40.612 --> 34:42.996
- She could be down there.
- She could be anywhere.

34:43.065 --> 34:44.398
The quarantine protocol's
already in place.

34:44.449 --> 34:47.034
- Sir, if she's in there...
- It's a class two breach.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.087
We have to seal it before
we lose this whole block.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.237
Five minutes.
Give us five minutes.

34:54.842 --> 34:55.960
You got three.

34:59.515 --> 35:02.934
<i>Warning.
Quarantine protocol imminent.</i>

35:04.303 --> 35:08.139
<i>Warning.
Protocol initiation imminent.</i>

35:12.561 --> 35:13.811
What are you doing here?

35:13.896 --> 35:16.781
I found the blueprints.

35:16.865 --> 35:20.868
Realized what you're up to,
and I can't let you do this again.

35:20.936 --> 35:23.655
Olivia!

35:23.739 --> 35:25.456
- Dunham!
- Liv!

35:28.777 --> 35:29.827
Warning.

35:29.912 --> 35:31.629
All right, we gotta move.

35:31.714 --> 35:33.381
Okay. Wait.
Joshua Rose is in there...

35:33.448 --> 35:34.949
We gotta go!

35:35.000 --> 35:37.118
<i>Quarantine protocol initiated.</i>

35:37.169 --> 35:38.285
We gotta go!

35:38.337 --> 35:40.171
<i>Massive loss of life
will result.</i>

35:40.255 --> 35:42.340
Matt, you gotta leave.
There's no time for this.

35:42.424 --> 35:43.457
You gotta go right now.

35:43.509 --> 35:45.960
You don't need the money!

35:50.933 --> 35:52.984
Where are your tools?

35:53.068 --> 35:55.903
Unless they think they have me,
they'll never stop.

35:57.773 --> 35:58.856
There's no other way.

35:58.941 --> 36:00.274
If I turn myself in,
they'll figure it out...

36:00.326 --> 36:01.609
They'll know I wasn't
the one in the amber.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.277
They'll take you.

36:03.329 --> 36:06.364
You're the only person alive
that survived the quarantine.

36:06.448 --> 36:09.167
They'll experiment on you
for the rest of your life.

36:09.251 --> 36:10.668
You know that.

36:11.887 --> 36:16.374
Matty...
Matt, you gotta go.

36:16.458 --> 36:18.343
I'm not taking your life twice.

36:20.262 --> 36:22.714
Josh... No...

36:22.798 --> 36:24.799
Matt...

36:24.850 --> 36:27.101
Let me do this one good thing.

36:55.581 --> 36:56.914
Quarantine protocol complete.

36:56.982 --> 36:59.700
One casualty.
Joshua Rose.

36:59.752 --> 37:01.552
Let's clean up and go home.

37:03.505 --> 37:05.673
Dunham, you hang back.

37:09.595 --> 37:12.480
Are you aware of how many
protocols you broke?

37:19.888 --> 37:21.522
Good work.

37:21.573 --> 37:24.525
Thank you, Colonel.

37:31.867 --> 37:34.869
All civilians must now evacuate the area.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.922
This area is now
under quarantine.

37:43.429 --> 37:45.379
Hello.

37:49.084 --> 37:51.185
We found your brother.

37:51.253 --> 37:52.386
And I'm sorry to say

37:52.438 --> 37:56.140
he was caught in a quarantine
protocol last night.

37:56.225 --> 37:57.558
Where?

37:57.609 --> 37:59.861
Riverdale Mutual.

37:59.928 --> 38:01.395
In the Bronx.

38:01.447 --> 38:03.481
He was attempting to break in.

38:05.284 --> 38:07.652
Well, thank you
for telling me, Agent.

38:07.736 --> 38:10.288
I'm sorry.

38:16.995 --> 38:18.279
True or false?

38:18.330 --> 38:19.997
I take this to my lab,

38:20.065 --> 38:21.649
get them to run
this skin sample,

38:21.717 --> 38:23.050
they'd tell me
this was from a man

38:23.118 --> 38:26.721
who spent the past
four years in amber.

38:26.788 --> 38:30.174
Hey, Dad, Mom needs you to
stick the steaks on the grill.

38:30.259 --> 38:32.260
Okay, buddy.

38:42.771 --> 38:44.655
Have a good day.

38:44.740 --> 38:49.527
And you can consider
this investigation closed.

38:58.253 --> 39:01.122
You know why
you let him go, don't you?

39:01.173 --> 39:03.875
It's 'cause you can understand
what he's going through.

39:03.959 --> 39:05.209
Trapped in that amber.

39:05.294 --> 39:07.011
Just like you're trapped over here.

39:10.349 --> 39:14.302
Only difference is
nobody's going to save you.

39:14.353 --> 39:16.270
Only you can save yourself.

39:17.839 --> 39:19.340
You listened to me
about the case.

39:19.391 --> 39:21.392
I don't understand why you
won't listen to me about this.

39:21.476 --> 39:23.945
Why do you refuse
to believe who you are?

39:24.012 --> 39:25.846
Why do you want to deny
the truth about yourself?

39:25.898 --> 39:27.865
You know, you can't prove
anything that you're saying.

39:27.950 --> 39:29.567
But I know things.

39:29.651 --> 39:32.353
You're in my head.

39:32.421 --> 39:35.907
Exactly. Which means
you know things too.

39:35.991 --> 39:37.875
Things about the other side.

39:37.960 --> 39:41.662
Things you couldn't possibly
know unless you'd been there.

39:41.730 --> 39:44.215
Unless you were from there.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.252
Like what?

39:48.337 --> 39:50.721
On the other side,
the twin towers have fallen.

39:50.806 --> 39:52.924
On the other side,
your sister Rachel is still alive.

39:53.008 --> 39:55.042
She lives in Chicago.
Her husband took a job there.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.644
They live at 1934 Sherman...

39:56.711 --> 39:58.379
See, now I know you're lying,

39:58.430 --> 39:59.764
because Rachel hates Chicago.

39:59.848 --> 40:01.265
Your beautiful niece
Ella is alive.

40:01.350 --> 40:03.951
She was born,
and it's her birthday today.

40:04.019 --> 40:07.004
She turns seven.

40:07.072 --> 40:09.607
There's no way to prove it.

40:11.393 --> 40:13.527
Yes, there is.

40:18.116 --> 40:20.284
Brandon.

40:20.369 --> 40:22.536
I wanna go back in the tank.

40:22.588 --> 40:26.040
You're not scheduled
for another test until tomorrow.

40:45.394 --> 40:47.094
Anything new?

40:47.145 --> 40:48.396
No.

40:48.447 --> 40:51.148
But something interesting.

40:51.233 --> 40:56.704
About twenty minutes ago,
her brain chemistry spiked.

40:56.772 --> 41:00.908
It seems there's some
dormant chemical in her brain.

41:00.959 --> 41:04.011
Hmm. Some sort of
synthetic compound.

41:04.079 --> 41:05.796
From the way it's bound
to her neurons,

41:05.881 --> 41:09.467
I'd say it's been there
since she was a child.

42:23.125 --> 42:24.858
<i>Ella: Hello?</i>

42:24.910 --> 42:26.377
Hi.

42:26.461 --> 42:27.712
<i>Aunt Liv?</i>

42:27.796 --> 42:30.664
<i>I knew you wouldn't
forget my birthday.</i>

42:34.086 --> 42:36.887
<i>Aunt Liv?</i>

42:48.316 --> 42:51.268
What happened?

42:51.353 --> 42:53.654
It didn't work.

42:53.721 --> 42:57.241
Nothing happened.
All I saw was black.
