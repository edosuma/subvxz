00:48.620 --> 00:52.249
Morgan, your friend's resort better be
as nice as you say it is.

00:52.250 --> 00:53.456
Hey, I never said it was his.

00:53.460 --> 00:57.669
He just manages the place, but trust me
when I tell you it is off the hook.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.787
Hot sunny days, cool breezes at night,

01:00.790 --> 01:03.532
never-ending tropical drinks
with the little umbrellas and nothing

01:03.540 --> 01:06.828
but young, beautiful adults looking
to make vacation memories.

01:06.830 --> 01:10.118
-Male and female, right?
-Elle, two weeks of pure heaven.

01:11.210 --> 01:14.919
I can't imagine what two weeks away
from this place is going to feel like.

01:14.920 --> 01:16.740
Well, you know, you better
thank your man upstairs

01:16.750 --> 01:17.876
for making it the whole team.

01:17.880 --> 01:19.199
Otherwise, you know they'd find a reason

01:19.210 --> 01:21.496
-to bring us back up in here.
-Why? They got other teams.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.206
Okay, you can go on believing
that if you want to,

01:23.210 --> 01:24.666
but I am not answering my cell phone.

01:24.670 --> 01:26.160
Okay.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.286
Oh, there he is.

01:28.290 --> 01:31.202
Pretty boy. Last chance.

01:31.210 --> 01:34.168
I can get my man to swing you
a hotel room for practically nothing.

01:34.170 --> 01:36.286
Even you might get
a little loving out there.

01:36.290 --> 01:37.496
Thanks anyway.

01:37.500 --> 01:40.537
-Oh, come on, Reid, live a little, huh?
-I have to go. Going home.

01:40.540 --> 01:42.872
-Have a good one, guys.
-Bye.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.410
He look okay to you?

01:47.420 --> 01:48.705
He looks about the way I would

01:48.710 --> 01:50.496
if I was going to spend two weeks
with my family.

01:50.500 --> 01:51.819
Hey, don't knock family.

01:51.830 --> 01:54.207
I'm going to get nothing but
for the next 336 hours.

01:54.210 --> 01:55.325
Good for you.

01:55.330 --> 01:57.321
Haley's got a list of chores
a mile long and I can't wait.

01:57.330 --> 01:59.537
The biggest decision I gotta make
is what I'm gonna do first.

01:59.540 --> 02:01.952
I bet you she has a thought or two
about that as well.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.825
-Bring it on.
-I'll be lost in a cabin in the woods

02:03.830 --> 02:06.037
for the next two weeks.
Do not call me for anything.

02:06.040 --> 02:08.110
Have a great time.
You all deserve a break.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.111
Seriously, don't call.

02:10.460 --> 02:11.529
Don't worry.

02:51.250 --> 02:52.535
Yes?

02:54.080 --> 02:55.707
Thank you.

03:06.540 --> 03:08.201
Darling?

03:10.040 --> 03:14.329
My darling,
I must go out now for a while.

03:17.040 --> 03:22.034
But I promise you,
it will all be over soon.

03:22.920 --> 03:27.698
One way or another, it will all be over.

04:21.290 --> 04:22.416
MONTEGO BAY, JAMAICA

04:22.420 --> 04:24.069
Writer Elbert Hubbard said,

04:24.080 --> 04:28.449
"No man needs a vacation so much
as the man who has Just had one."

04:33.080 --> 04:35.742
-Come on, did I lie to you?
-You did not lie.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.076
-Oh, yes. Thank you.
-Thank you.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.205
Cheers.

04:42.210 --> 04:43.575
Welcome to paradise.

04:43.580 --> 04:48.529
-There you are.
-Yes, sir. My man, Mr. Gerald Dupree.

04:48.540 --> 04:50.701
-How you doing, man?
-I'm wonderful. I'm wonderful.

04:50.710 --> 04:52.029
Look at you holding it together.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.701
-Look at him.
-Hey, I'm trying, baby.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.668
This right here is my partner
from the FBI, Ms. Elle Greenaway.

04:56.670 --> 04:58.376
You didn't tell me she was beautiful.

04:58.380 --> 05:00.325
Would that have gotten me
a better deal on the room?

05:00.330 --> 05:02.412
You want me to show you a brochure
with the real rates?

05:02.420 --> 05:03.705
Hey, hey, I'm done.
I'm done. I'm done.

05:03.710 --> 05:06.110
-Your resort is beautiful.
-Hey, thank you.

05:06.120 --> 05:08.873
I always wondered what it would be
like to work in paradise.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.575
Turns out it's not half bad.

05:10.580 --> 05:13.208
-Anything else you need?
-Yeah, I think...

05:13.960 --> 05:15.575
Ooh! Wait a minute.

05:15.580 --> 05:19.459
Look at that right there.
Lord have mercy.

05:19.460 --> 05:21.416
I think I need to handle something.

05:22.460 --> 05:25.167
-You need any backup?
-Uh, you better watch your mouth.

05:25.170 --> 05:27.786
-Elle, you going to be all right?
-Oh, no, I'm fine. You go.

05:27.790 --> 05:31.374
-That's such a good answer.
-Get out of here. Get out of here.

05:31.380 --> 05:33.109
So, how about you

05:33.120 --> 05:34.917
Oh, thank you,
I'll let you know if there's anything.

05:34.920 --> 05:37.036
-Thank you, Gerald.
-I'll be around.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.530
-All right.
-All right.

05:38.540 --> 05:39.825
Ladies, ladies.

05:40.540 --> 05:41.666
Hi.

05:42.790 --> 05:43.916
Hey.

05:48.420 --> 05:51.287
-Sorry about that.
-No problem.

05:51.620 --> 05:55.784
-Hey, you alone?
-Completely.

05:56.120 --> 05:58.111
Do you want to play?

05:59.420 --> 06:00.785
Yeah.

06:20.040 --> 06:23.419
Honey, you're supposed to be
dumping things, not examining them.

06:23.420 --> 06:25.376
-Pirate Number Four.
-Cute.

06:25.380 --> 06:28.872
Yeah, but do you really want to remember
your first and last appearance on stage?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.207
I wasn't very good,
but I was very committed.

06:32.210 --> 06:36.453
-Yeah. I'd dump it.
-Do I have to?

06:37.540 --> 06:39.076
Okay, I'll make you a deal.

06:39.080 --> 06:42.038
Come up with a good reason
by the end of the day and it stays.

06:42.040 --> 06:43.450
You drive a hard bargain.

07:31.540 --> 07:35.658
My "humble servant"

07:37.500 --> 07:42.039
My heart doth swell at the sight of thee,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.537
my brave Sir Kneighf.

07:45.540 --> 07:48.498
I shall follow where you lead.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.876
-Hey.
-You're still here?

07:49.880 --> 07:52.610
Yeah, I don't get the same vacation
time as the rest of the team.

07:52.620 --> 07:54.281
Got to make sure
there's plenty of work for them

07:54.290 --> 07:55.496
-when they get back.
-Right.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.957
-What are you doing?
-I'm in Camelot.

07:57.960 --> 08:01.418
-Camelot

08:01.420 --> 08:03.820
I'm just outside
the magical city of Camelot,

08:03.830 --> 08:07.322
adventuring with
the incredible Sir Kneighf.

08:07.330 --> 08:10.493
-Oh, the incredible Sir Kneighf.
-JJ, this guy is amazing.

08:10.500 --> 08:13.492
Oh, gosh, please tell me you don't have
a crush on a fictional character.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.458
He's not fictional. He's the online
alter ego of a real person.

08:16.460 --> 08:17.779
Mmm-hmm.

08:17.790 --> 08:21.499
But you don't know anything about him,
or even if he is a him.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.615
Okay, you know what? I...

08:22.620 --> 08:26.954
Look, we meet online at specified times
that he is never late to.

08:27.380 --> 08:32.113
We spend hours adventuring
and chatting, during which time

08:32.120 --> 08:36.819
I have his undivided attention
and he lavishes me with flattery.

08:36.830 --> 08:37.956
Wow.

08:37.960 --> 08:40.451
When was the last time
you had a date go that well?

08:44.500 --> 08:46.661
See if he's got a fictional brother,
all right?

08:46.670 --> 08:48.285
Yeah, he doesn't.

08:48.290 --> 08:51.612
Cousin, uncle, grandfather, whatever.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.326
BENNINGTON SANITARIUM, NEVADA

09:07.210 --> 09:09.747
-I heard a rumor you were here.
-Hi.

09:10.120 --> 09:13.499
-How's she doing?
-Schizophrenia's a lifetime illness.

09:13.500 --> 09:17.709
The meds stabilize the worst of her
symptoms, but she still has bad days.

09:17.710 --> 09:22.488
What makes her most happy
are her journals and your daily letters.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.378
-She is exceptionally proud of you.
-She is?

09:25.380 --> 09:30.079
Talks about you all the time to anyone
who will listen. Staff, other patients.

09:30.080 --> 09:33.117
Her journals are filled with the cases
you write her about.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.031
Calls them your adventures.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.452
Mom's of the belief
that you can find adventure

09:37.460 --> 09:39.246
all around you if you just look.

09:39.250 --> 09:42.413
That's what happens when you're
a professor of 15th century literature.

09:42.420 --> 09:43.739
Well, she's going to be so excited

09:43.750 --> 09:46.787
that you were finally able
to get here in person.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.911
Maybe it's better
if I just let her rest today.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.320
-Rest?
-Yeah, I'll come back tomorrow.

09:53.330 --> 09:55.958
-But, Doctor, she's...
-Hey, can you give this to her?

09:55.960 --> 09:58.611
It's Margery Kempe, her favorite.

09:58.620 --> 10:00.531
It would really be good for her
if you could just...

10:00.540 --> 10:02.701
Please? Thank you so much. Thanks.

10:27.290 --> 10:30.168
Well, you all right, there, Greenaway?

10:30.170 --> 10:32.035
-Go away.

10:34.040 --> 10:36.998
-See you tomorrow?
-Afternoon.

10:37.540 --> 10:41.658
-Afternoon?
-Don't speak.

10:53.710 --> 10:59.285
He's sound asleep,
so we have a few hours to ourselves.

11:00.830 --> 11:04.493
Dinner was amazing.

11:04.790 --> 11:06.917
Well, it's nice to have someone here
to cook for.

11:06.920 --> 11:11.038
-Well, it's nice to be here.
-What you looking at?

11:11.920 --> 11:14.741
-Reflections 1987.
-Oh, boy.

11:15.500 --> 11:19.118
I remember the day I got this.
It was the end of my junior year.

11:19.580 --> 11:25.246
I was walking down the hall
and I accidentally walked

11:25.250 --> 11:28.663
into a theatre club rehearsal
and I saw you.

11:30.250 --> 11:33.037
And I knew I was going to marry you.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.200
Aw!

11:34.790 --> 11:39.375
And I went home that night
and I looked you up.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.918
-Haley Brooks, 10th grade...
- Oh, look at my hair.

11:43.920 --> 11:48.823
...and I thought, "How could
I have missed you for two years?"

11:49.580 --> 11:53.368
So, the next day
I knew I had to meet you,

11:54.080 --> 11:56.571
so I went in and I joined
the theatre club.

11:56.580 --> 11:58.878
And that's how I was
in The Pirates of Penzance

11:58.880 --> 12:02.873
as the worst Fourth Pirate in history.

12:09.580 --> 12:13.493
-Aaron? Keep the hat.
-Okay.

12:23.790 --> 12:26.418
I always forget
what a great cook you are.

12:27.790 --> 12:28.950
Wine?

12:28.960 --> 12:33.408
Jason, you know I'm not responsible
for myself after two. Thank you.

12:46.120 --> 12:49.578
Do I sound old ifI say they
don't make music like this any more?

12:49.580 --> 12:50.877
Yes.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.240
Mmm.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.708
Hmm. It's good to be old.

13:29.420 --> 13:31.991
Agent Hotchner.

13:32.830 --> 13:38.325
Don't waste time on the first victims.
They were unrepentant, bad men.

13:38.330 --> 13:40.378
She's the important one.

13:40.380 --> 13:44.202
Remember,
everything starts at the beginning.

13:44.210 --> 13:46.781
-Who is this?-There won't be much time.

13:46.790 --> 13:49.418
The youngest holds the key.

13:49.420 --> 13:52.378
You must help him save her.

13:55.540 --> 13:57.872
What's going on?

13:59.830 --> 14:01.377
I don't know.

14:04.250 --> 14:07.458
Okay, it was an anonymous call.
A man.

14:07.710 --> 14:10.372
He said there had been a murder
in Room 19.

14:10.380 --> 14:13.747
I called Security to check it out,
but when they saw the...

14:15.170 --> 14:17.286
I thought it would be best
if I called you right away.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.076
-You have a key?
-Yeah.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.740
What the hell?

14:56.920 --> 14:58.956
"All work and no play."

15:04.920 --> 15:09.209
No, no, no, no.

15:09.460 --> 15:12.668
No, no, no, no.

15:12.670 --> 15:13.910
Oh, my...

15:14.750 --> 15:16.877
No. No.

15:37.210 --> 15:40.031
Sorry. No one should be coming here.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.917
Go wait in the bedroom.

15:52.580 --> 15:55.117
-Jason Gideon?
-Yeah.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.610
-What is it?
-Nellie Fox.

16:38.380 --> 16:42.703
-Let go! Stop! Stop it! Stop it!
-Please, get down. Stay down.

16:42.710 --> 16:47.113
-Let go of me! No! Let go!
-Hold still. Hold still.

16:48.380 --> 16:51.747
Who are you

16:59.540 --> 17:02.998
I'm sorry. I just... I just never, ever
saw anything like this before.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.661
Here. Come here.
Get in my car. I'll drive you.

17:04.670 --> 17:07.286
Oh, okay. Thank you.

17:12.120 --> 17:13.951
Contact me at the BAU
when you're finished.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.666
I want to know
who the hell that used to be.

17:15.670 --> 17:17.240
-Do you know anybody in Jamaica?
-No.

17:17.250 --> 17:19.707
That's the postal zone where it seems
the package was sent from.

17:19.710 --> 17:20.870
Montego Bay, Jamaica.

17:20.880 --> 17:23.826
What, you think I didn't see that?
I don't know anybody in Jamaica.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.161
Then how did the blood
get outSIde your door?

17:28.170 --> 17:31.913
I have no idea. There wasn't
any blood lnSIde, was there?

17:31.920 --> 17:33.990
-Who was _the victim?

17:34.000 --> 17:37.663
For the hundredth time,
I didn't even know that there was a victim

17:37.670 --> 17:39.615
until you dragged me out of bed!

17:39.620 --> 17:41.747
Where's the victim's head?

17:42.670 --> 17:44.740
Well, I must have dropped it
on my way in here.

17:44.750 --> 17:47.412
Come on, you know that I have nothing
to do with this.

17:47.420 --> 17:51.322
I'm an American FBI agent.
I'm here on vacation, man.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.285
I'm the police, just like you.

18:05.080 --> 18:08.288
-Are you the "her"

18:19.210 --> 18:20.950
I don't care where
the blood led, Detective.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.030
You've made a mistake.
We are FBI agents.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.076
BAU profilers here on vacation.

18:25.080 --> 18:30.165
-Profilers_? _ _
-Yes, we handle serial criminals.

18:30.170 --> 18:31.910
We consult police departments
all over the world.

18:31.920 --> 18:36.243
Oh, so if I called you to consult on this,
would it be your advice

18:36.250 --> 18:39.617
to let the woman who we found
at the end of the blood trail go?

18:39.620 --> 18:41.076
Agent Greenaway is not a killer.

18:41.080 --> 18:44.038
Well, can you explain why the blood
went right to her door?

18:44.040 --> 18:46.201
Obviously somebody
would like you to think she is.

18:46.210 --> 18:48.610
Look, my supervisor's flying down here
from Virginia.

18:48.620 --> 18:52.454
He'll be here anytime, and when
he gets here, we will figure this out.

18:52.460 --> 18:55.281
His name was Marty Harris.
At least that's who rented this room.

18:55.290 --> 18:59.203
-Hey, why are you telling him?
-I'm sorry. I just...

19:00.790 --> 19:02.200
My mistake. I'm sorry, ma'am.

19:02.210 --> 19:03.916
When did this Harris check in?

19:03.920 --> 19:06.286
A couple of days ago, with another man.

19:06.290 --> 19:08.781
Giles. Frank Giles.
He has the adjoining room.

19:08.790 --> 19:11.827
We tried calling him,
but he doesn't answer.

19:22.580 --> 19:25.538
Well, it looks like
Frank Giles is in the wind.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.952
You might have yourself
a real suspect now.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.110
I'll get crime scene men in here.

19:39.790 --> 19:43.374
All work and no play, huh

19:43.380 --> 19:46.167
You just wait till I am through with you.

19:47.460 --> 19:49.872
-What?
-Garcia, I need a rundown on a guy.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.825
-No.
-What?

19:51.830 --> 19:53.707
The information superhighway is closed.

19:53.710 --> 19:55.246
What are you talking about?

19:55.250 --> 19:58.037
Someone_ had the nerve to run a black
hat op Into my computers, Morgan.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.246
They hacked me. Okay?

19:59.250 --> 20:00.820
But you can bet your sweet ass
I will find them.

20:00.830 --> 20:04.072
I've got honeypot farms hidden
behind UML kernel data packets

20:04.080 --> 20:07.379
and a first-generation honeynet
I personally programmed.

20:07.380 --> 20:10.668
My Snort log lists every visitor,
every server request,

20:10.670 --> 20:12.570
every keystroke on this entire network.

20:12.580 --> 20:15.879
IfI have to back-hack his IP
all the way to the freaking Stone Age,

20:15.880 --> 20:18.531
I will find this son of a bitch.
Okay? So bye.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.327
-Gideon, I've been trying to call you.
-Why?

20:24.330 --> 20:26.616
-Someone sent you a head?
-From Jamaica.

20:26.620 --> 20:29.327
Morgan and Elle are in Jamaica right now.
There was a murder.

20:29.330 --> 20:31.207
The body was headless.
Elle's been arrested for it.

20:31.210 --> 20:32.871
-What?
-Hotch headed down there last night

20:32.880 --> 20:34.825
with some Bureau lawyers
and a crime scene unit.

20:34.830 --> 20:36.616
He should be there by now.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.706
If you talk to him,
have him call me right away.

20:39.710 --> 20:40.916
Yes, sir.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.114
-Gideon.
-Yeah.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.497
The baseball card and envelope
that were attached to the box.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.377
We processed them. There's nothing,

20:46.380 --> 20:49.611
and we're still working
on identifying the head.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.609
Try contacting the Montego Bay Police.

20:51.620 --> 20:53.417
Apparently they have
a headless homicide victim.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.569
Got it.

20:54.580 --> 20:56.787
What time did you go to bed?

20:56.790 --> 21:00.829
Around midnight, I think.
I don't really know. It was late.

21:01.250 --> 21:02.877
Were you alone?

21:03.210 --> 21:05.747
By the time I got back to my room, yeah.

21:06.170 --> 21:09.617
Detective St. Pierre, I'm SSA Hotchner.

21:09.620 --> 21:12.418
-I'm Agent Greenaway's superior.
-We're not finished here.

21:12.420 --> 21:15.321
Agent Greenaway only arrived
in your country yesterday afternoon.

21:15.330 --> 21:16.570
-Thank you.
-So?

21:16.580 --> 21:18.161
I brought a forensics expert

21:18.170 --> 21:20.570
and he's examined the body at your morgue,

21:20.580 --> 21:23.879
and he's put the time of death
at no less than 24 hours ago.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.745
Now, this is based on
advanced rigor mortis

21:25.750 --> 21:28.571
and the contents of the stomach,
which contained a meal that he ordered

21:28.580 --> 21:29.990
from room service two days ago.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.787
Your coroner concurs with the findings.

21:32.790 --> 21:34.872
What this means is that
Agent Greenaway wasn't even here

21:34.880 --> 21:35.915
when this man was killed.

21:36.750 --> 21:39.116
Now, I appreciate
that you have a difficult situation

21:39.120 --> 21:40.576
and Agents Morgan and Greenaway

21:40.580 --> 21:42.286
are happy to cooperate
in any way that they can,

21:42.290 --> 21:46.112
but they'll do it from our offices
in Quantico, Virginia.

21:55.170 --> 21:57.912
Oh, well, that's great, Hotch.

21:57.920 --> 22:01.412
Gideon wants you to call him
as soon as you can.

22:01.420 --> 22:02.569
Uh...

22:02.580 --> 22:05.913
I think I better let him tell you.

22:05.920 --> 22:08.741
Okay, call me
if you need anything. Bye.

22:43.670 --> 22:45.376
Oh, Dr. Reid?

22:45.920 --> 22:48.707
Someone delivered this to the desk
last night for you.

22:48.710 --> 22:50.029
What?

23:18.920 --> 23:20.490
Come in.

23:21.540 --> 23:24.668
Hey, um, I just got
a really strange delivery.

23:24.670 --> 23:27.161
Strange as a head
in the middle of the night?

23:29.380 --> 23:32.167
That's a Pale Clouded Yellow butterfly.

23:32.170 --> 23:34.456
They're indigenous to Europe.
Britain mainly.

23:34.460 --> 23:37.748
"She has been searched for
yet never found."

23:44.040 --> 23:46.076
What the hell is going on here?

24:13.290 --> 24:15.747
You guys, you sure you don't want
to go home and get some rest?

24:15.750 --> 24:17.991
-Take a shower?
-Like hell.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.456
I'm good.

24:19.460 --> 24:21.416
How much sleep have you gotten
in the last 24 hours?

24:21.420 --> 24:23.911
Hotch, I spent half of the night
in an interrogation room.

24:23.920 --> 24:26.411
I am not sleeping
until I find this Frank Giles.

24:26.420 --> 24:29.492
Frank Giles left Jamaica last night
on the redeye.

24:29.500 --> 24:32.287
Flew to Florida, then got onto another
flight to Virginia.

24:32.290 --> 24:34.781
Virginia

24:34.790 --> 24:38.419
I don't know if he's from here,
but this is where he flew to. Arlington.

24:38.420 --> 24:42.709
He's got a long criminal record.
Manslaughter, robbery, rape.

24:42.710 --> 24:45.167
What about the victim, Marty Harris?

24:45.170 --> 24:47.786
Uh, he's a two-time
convicted fetish burglar,

24:47.790 --> 24:49.951
-registered child sex offender...
-And we have his head.

24:49.960 --> 24:53.168
CSU just positively identified
the one delivered to my cabin.

24:53.170 --> 24:54.660
"Don't waste time on the first victims.

24:54.670 --> 24:58.492
"They were unrepentant, bad men.
They only got what they deserved."

24:58.500 --> 25:00.456
-What is that?
-I got a phone call last night

25:00.460 --> 25:01.779
before you called from Jamaica.

25:01.790 --> 25:03.746
Any mention of a "her"?

25:03.750 --> 25:05.786
"You must help him save her."

25:05.790 --> 25:07.781
Oh, so there's a "him" now, too?

25:07.790 --> 25:09.701
-I think he means Reid.
-Reid?

25:09.710 --> 25:11.530
We need to regroup.

25:13.960 --> 25:16.997
So, clearly we have a psychopath
intent on drawing us into his game.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.571
-Playing with us.
-Then let's return the favor.

25:19.580 --> 25:23.459
He kept telling us repeatedly
to save her. What "her"?

25:23.460 --> 25:25.576
Items he's sent
must be some kind of clues.

25:25.580 --> 25:26.740
Let's get them up on the board.

25:26.750 --> 25:32.245
I got a Nellie Fox baseball card
from 1963 and I got a head in a box.

25:32.250 --> 25:34.787
I got a rare butterfly in a shadow box.

25:34.790 --> 25:36.951
And repeated messages to "save her."

25:36.960 --> 25:39.201
I got the decapitated body

25:39.210 --> 25:41.576
and a nice visit
to the Jamaican Police Headquarters.

25:41.580 --> 25:42.956
Reid called from Nevada.

25:42.960 --> 25:46.168
He's on the way back here with
a skeleton key and a note he got, too.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.616
And the guy who called me said,
"The youngest one holds the key."

25:48.620 --> 25:50.030
-That's Reid.
-Okay, but wait a minute.

25:50.040 --> 25:52.531
UnSubs, they don't contact us this way.

25:52.540 --> 25:54.610
I mean, they might taunt us,
dare us to catch them,

25:54.620 --> 25:56.076
but they don't drag us into their fantasy.

25:56.080 --> 25:59.322
-Why not?
-Because they're sexual fantasies.

25:59.330 --> 26:03.619
I mean, taunting us is a show of power,
but making us the object is...

26:03.620 --> 26:05.611
I don't know what the hell that is.

26:05.620 --> 26:08.202
There's something else
about the baseball card.

26:08.210 --> 26:11.668
Nellie Fox was one of the stars
of the 1959 White Sox.

26:11.920 --> 26:15.993
I went to almost every game with
my father that year. Fox was my hero.

26:17.710 --> 26:19.701
So is it a coincidence
that he sends this to me,

26:19.710 --> 26:20.950
or does he know how I feel about him?

26:22.170 --> 26:24.991
I collected butterflies
when I was a little girl.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.286
That's how I knew what butterfly
was in the box.

26:27.290 --> 26:30.327
-So then he knows us?
-I got an anonymous message.

26:30.330 --> 26:31.911
I got a police raid.

26:31.920 --> 26:33.820
But he knew exactly where we were.

26:33.830 --> 26:36.321
Hotel in Jamaica, Gideon at the cabin,

26:36.330 --> 26:37.911
Reid in Vegas, you at your home.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.535
He got that from the Bureau computers.

26:40.670 --> 26:43.878
Your locations are always in there
so they can find you if they need you.

26:43.880 --> 26:47.031
And I checked the log. The hacker
was definitely in the personnel folders.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.531
There were ro_om numbers
to the hotel In Jamaica,

26:49.540 --> 26:51.451
the address of Gideon's cabin...

26:52.670 --> 26:54.820
There's a lot of information
in those databases.

26:54.830 --> 26:57.458
Have you figured out how he was able
to get into the Bureau's computers?

26:58.790 --> 27:00.246
I'm still working on that.

27:02.460 --> 27:05.327
-Garcia, if you know something...
-No, it's, um...

27:06.960 --> 27:09.451
It'sjust... I...

27:10.580 --> 27:12.878
I was playing a game yesterday.

27:14.420 --> 27:16.035
An online game.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.491
-A game?
-Not on the Bureau computers, sir.

27:19.500 --> 27:22.287
-On my own personal laptop.
-No, Garcia. No, no, no.

27:22.290 --> 27:23.575
I don't understand.

27:23.580 --> 27:25.207
Wireless Internet.

27:25.210 --> 27:28.577
By wirelessly hooking
into the Net here to get online,

27:28.580 --> 27:30.662
the hacker could have gotten
into my computer first,

27:32.170 --> 27:35.242
and I have far less protection
on my own laptop.

27:35.250 --> 27:38.822
And he could have gotten into the entire
Bureau computer system this way?

27:38.830 --> 27:40.070
Yeah, it's possible.

27:40.080 --> 27:41.411
Playing a game?

27:43.500 --> 27:45.661
How could you be that stupid?

27:45.670 --> 27:48.457
Information, files.
You have a responsibility.

27:48.460 --> 27:50.746
I know, sir. I'm so sorry.

27:55.330 --> 27:56.957
-But I found him.
-You what?

27:56.960 --> 27:59.747
I know who he is, the hacker.
His name is Giles. Frank Giles.

27:59.750 --> 28:01.456
He lives in Arlington, Virginia,
four miles from here.

28:01.460 --> 28:03.530
-I have his address.
-Garcia, you said Giles?

28:47.210 --> 28:48.700
-Clear!
-Dooﬂ

28:48.710 --> 28:50.610
Okay here.

28:51.080 --> 28:54.572
-Frank Giles? FBI.
-Come out, Giles!

29:03.960 --> 29:05.746
You've got to be kidding me.

29:06.960 --> 29:11.329
Hotch! Gideon! Ithink you're
going to want to see this.

29:31.080 --> 29:34.163
-He's definitely playing with us.
-His identification checks out.

29:34.170 --> 29:36.070
That's Frank Giles.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.662
There's a big old bag of money
sitting right here on the dresser.

29:38.670 --> 29:41.207
So Giles took Harris to Jamaica
to kill him

29:41.210 --> 29:42.825
and then the UnSub killed Giles.

29:42.830 --> 29:44.320
Yeah, but he paid him first.

29:44.330 --> 29:46.616
-And left the cash?
-Well, he's apparently well-funded.

29:46.620 --> 29:48.997
He said these were
"unrepentant, bad men."

29:49.000 --> 29:50.615
Are we looking for some kind of vigilante?

29:50.620 --> 29:54.454
No. The bodies are nothing
but a way to get us interested.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.826
They're game pieces.
The killings are secondary.

29:56.830 --> 29:59.822
Well, this guy likes to write things
in blood on walls.

29:59.830 --> 30:02.037
All kinds of cult
and demonic significance to that.

30:02.040 --> 30:06.818
"Thy Quest?
Thy quest doth truly begin."

30:06.830 --> 30:08.707
I mean, why start phrasing things
like this now?

30:08.710 --> 30:10.530
Yeah, all the other messages
were in modern English.

30:10.540 --> 30:13.327
Maybe this is the first one
the UnSub actually wrote.

30:13.330 --> 30:14.615
So we're looking for Shakespeare?

30:14.620 --> 30:16.076
-Hey, guys?
-Yeah.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.412
There's something etched on the blade.

30:20.330 --> 30:26.109
"To learn of what should next be done,
leave the blade till the hour be none."

30:26.120 --> 30:28.327
-"Hour be none"?
-"Leave the blade."

30:28.790 --> 30:31.611
Elle, move for a second.
Move to your left.

30:31.620 --> 30:34.282
-The bed's in the middle of the room.
-Which isn't by chance.

30:34.290 --> 30:37.874
And maybe the light from here casts
a shadow and points to something.

30:37.880 --> 30:40.371
Come on. Are we in the middle
of an Indiana Jones movie?

30:40.380 --> 30:41.529
"The hour be none."

30:41.540 --> 30:44.247
Well, midnight is 0000 hours
in 24-hour time. Would that be none?

30:44.250 --> 30:46.787
-Midnight wouldn't cast a shadow.
-"Hour be none."

30:46.790 --> 30:48.075
00 pm.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.287
Hey, guys.
Garcia told me where to find you.

30:50.290 --> 30:51.917
00 p.m.?
-It's medieval.

30:51.920 --> 30:54.036
The days used to be broken
into hourly intervals,

30:54.040 --> 30:55.530
the canonical hours of the breviary.

30:55.540 --> 31:00.455
00 am, terce, 9:00 am,
sext, 12:00 noon, none, 3:00 p.m.,

31:00.460 --> 31:01.870
00 pm.

31:01.880 --> 31:03.416
Reid, do not ever go away again.

31:03.420 --> 31:05.456
Medieval.
That's why the language changed.

31:05.460 --> 31:06.609
"Doth."

31:06.620 --> 31:08.281
Everything this guy does is a clue.

31:08.290 --> 31:10.076
35.
What do we do?

31:10.080 --> 31:11.616
00 pm. tomorrow?

31:11.620 --> 31:13.668
Not if we can block that window out.

31:13.670 --> 31:15.615
Do you have any spotlights in your car?

31:15.620 --> 31:17.668
-Sure.
-Thanks, Gina.

31:17.670 --> 31:21.162
00 pm.

31:21.170 --> 31:25.322
Morgan, follow the shadow
as I move the light higher.

31:31.580 --> 31:34.242
-Okay, and do what?
-Tap.

31:41.620 --> 31:42.780
It's hollow.

31:42.790 --> 31:44.872
Definitely an Indiana Jones movie.

31:44.880 --> 31:46.825
Feels like the wallpaper's been replaced.

31:46.830 --> 31:48.115
Tear it open.

31:56.710 --> 31:58.109
Take it out.

31:58.120 --> 32:00.327
-Wait, are we sure that's safe

32:00.330 --> 32:02.412
You think he'd be playing this game
just to blow us up?

32:02.420 --> 32:06.038
He'd have already done that as long
as we've been standing here.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.490
It's locked. You want me to break it?

32:15.500 --> 32:17.161
No, we should process it first.

32:17.170 --> 32:19.320
"The youngest holds the key."

32:44.710 --> 32:48.328
Schubert. The Trout Quintet.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.786
Five people fishing.

32:52.540 --> 32:57.455
"Never would it be night, but always
clear day to any man's sight."

32:57.460 --> 32:59.075
Well, that was worth it.

33:00.540 --> 33:03.953
The lid.
Little tab right under the lock.

33:10.830 --> 33:12.206
Oh, God.

33:16.790 --> 33:18.701
-Do you have that evidence bag?
-Here you go.

33:18.710 --> 33:20.496
"Thy quest."

33:32.580 --> 33:34.070
He moves funny.

33:34.670 --> 33:36.069
It's like he's injured or something.

33:36.080 --> 33:40.870
I assure you, you will all understand
in the end why it must be this way.

33:40.880 --> 33:42.199
You might even thank me.

33:42.210 --> 33:43.700
Don't hold your breath, scumbag.

33:43.710 --> 33:45.917
You know now you're on a quest.

33:45.920 --> 33:48.992
A young girl's life depends
on the successful completion of it.

33:49.000 --> 33:53.664
As you can see, she is quite beautiful
and in distress.

33:54.120 --> 33:55.701
Now please listen closely,

33:55.710 --> 33:59.419
for there is one rule
and this rule must be followed.

34:05.670 --> 34:10.164
Jason Gideon, Aaron Hotchner,
Derek Morgan, Elle Greenaway,

34:10.170 --> 34:13.708
Spencer Reid,
Jennifer Jareau, Penelope Garcia.

34:13.960 --> 34:18.579
A quest must be completed in
the proper way or it isn't a quest, is it?

34:18.580 --> 34:22.664
That's it. One rule. Simple.

34:22.670 --> 34:25.571
Now, you will be receiving an item soon

34:25.580 --> 34:28.413
that will hold the final clue
you will need to finish the quest.

34:28.420 --> 34:31.492
You will find you will also need
a book which has inspired

34:31.500 --> 34:33.741
many an adventure like mine.

34:33.750 --> 34:37.538
Believe me when I tell you
I truly hope to see you all soon.

34:37.540 --> 34:44.321
It will mean a successful end
to this adventure for all of us.

34:46.670 --> 34:49.377
-This guy's got pictures of us

34:49.380 --> 34:51.245
Well, the lock of hair's
being analysed for DNA.

34:51.250 --> 34:52.490
There might be something on file.

34:52.500 --> 34:54.707
I'll get Video to enhance
the shots of the girl.

34:54.710 --> 34:56.200
Let's get the clues up on the board.

34:56.210 --> 34:57.780
Maybe we can make some sense of something.

34:57.790 --> 34:59.280
Wait, we're going
to play this guy's game?

34:59.290 --> 35:01.110
Do we have a choice?

35:02.670 --> 35:05.070
Be right back.
You guys keep working.

35:05.080 --> 35:06.320
Jason?

35:07.620 --> 35:08.780
Jason!

35:16.120 --> 35:18.202
What is it What's the matter with you?

35:18.210 --> 35:22.874
I... I just have nothing left.

35:23.210 --> 35:25.826
-Yeah, I'm tired, too.
-No, no, no.

35:26.500 --> 35:31.199
I needed a place where I didn't
have to know what was out there.

35:31.210 --> 35:36.910
_ Where I could
just close my eyes and not see

35:38.960 --> 35:42.873
bodies torn to pieces
or hear children calling out for help.

35:45.500 --> 35:48.742
That cabin was the only thing I had left,

35:49.750 --> 35:51.536
and this guy took it away from me.

35:52.790 --> 35:55.167
-Jason...
-Maybe I'm out of gas.

35:59.540 --> 36:01.826
I'd like to be alone, please.

36:15.920 --> 36:17.820
-Mrs. Hotchner.
-Hey.

36:20.210 --> 36:21.325
Haley.

36:24.670 --> 36:25.819
I've been trying to call you,

36:25.830 --> 36:27.240
but you haven't
been answering your cell.

36:27.250 --> 36:29.286
Oh, no, my battery died.
We just got back. What's wrong?

36:29.290 --> 36:32.248
A man came to the door with something
he said you would need right away.

36:32.250 --> 36:34.115
That a girl's life depended on it.

36:34.120 --> 36:36.782
-He came to the door?
-Yeah.

36:49.170 --> 36:50.660
What's going on, Aaron?

36:50.670 --> 36:52.820
Honey, what did the guy look like
who came to the door?

36:52.830 --> 36:56.618
Look like? Um, I don't know.
Young. Dark hair.

36:56.620 --> 36:58.167
Did he look injured?

36:58.170 --> 36:59.569
-Injured?
-Yeah.

36:59.580 --> 37:01.957
I mean,
did he seem injured in any way?

37:01.960 --> 37:04.246
No. He was just a guy.

37:04.250 --> 37:06.536
He told me what he was giving me,
you needed right away,

37:06.540 --> 37:08.997
that a girl's life depended on it.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.036
-Well, that's not a normal delivery.
-No.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.246
What do you mean?

37:12.250 --> 37:14.320
Well, they don't come
with detailed messages like that.

37:14.330 --> 37:17.072
Did he say all these things to you

37:17.080 --> 37:18.707
No, he said them.

37:18.710 --> 37:21.326
If he isn't the UnSub,
he probably talked to him.

37:21.330 --> 37:23.958
-What's going on?
-It's the case we're working on.

37:23.960 --> 37:25.496
What did he deliver?

37:26.330 --> 37:28.321
Um, a piece of paper with numbers on it.

37:28.330 --> 37:29.911
The team's got it.
It's in the conference room.

37:33.790 --> 37:36.418
My eyes are so heavy
I can barely see it.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.285
I think it's a
coded message of some sort.

37:38.290 --> 37:40.781
The UnSub said we needed
a book, didn't he?

37:40.790 --> 37:42.781
Yeah. "A book that inspired
many an adventure."

37:42.790 --> 37:44.166
It's a book code.

37:44.170 --> 37:46.786
Each one of these sets of numbers
represents a particular word.

37:46.790 --> 37:50.578
For instance, page 118,
line 30, word three.

37:50.580 --> 37:52.912
We need to figure out what the words are
and fill in the blanks.

37:52.920 --> 37:55.206
-Yeah, but from what book?
-I don't know.

37:55.210 --> 37:57.201
The trouble is, it has to be
the exact same edition

37:57.210 --> 37:59.030
of the exact same book that he used.

37:59.040 --> 38:01.668
Just got a DNA hit on the lock of hair.
Rebecca Bryant.

38:01.670 --> 38:04.537
She's been missing out of Boston
for two years.

38:04.540 --> 38:05.996
Two years?,

38:07.120 --> 38:10.374
Guys, how are we supposed to figure out
which book this code was copied out of?

38:10.380 --> 38:12.166
I have no idea.

38:17.580 --> 38:20.913
We need Haley to sit with a sketch artist
and get a picture of this guy.

38:20.920 --> 38:23.457
We can have JJ get it out
on the newswires. Tell the world.

38:23.460 --> 38:24.575
Tell the world?

38:24.580 --> 38:26.377
Well, he may have seen
this son of a bitch.

38:26.380 --> 38:28.530
Didn't he say that we had to keep this
within the team?

38:28.540 --> 38:29.575
Yeah.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.411
Get a sketch artist up here.

38:34.670 --> 38:37.662
He said we have everything needed
to complete the quest.

38:37.670 --> 38:39.991
The answer's got to be up there somewhere.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.116
JJ, get some reporters here
as soon as possible.

38:42.120 --> 38:45.248
-For what?
-Just say we need help on a new case.

38:47.750 --> 38:49.240
Press conference?

38:54.040 --> 38:55.371
Thank you all for coming.

38:55.380 --> 38:57.245
Haley and the baby get into a hotel?

38:57.250 --> 38:59.616
-Yeah.
-Good.

39:00.380 --> 39:02.166
Think this is going to work?

39:02.170 --> 39:04.491
I think it's going to send
the right message.

39:04.500 --> 39:07.242
We're looking for this man
in connection with several murders.

39:07.250 --> 39:09.821
He is approximately 25 years of age.

39:09.830 --> 39:12.742
He delivered a package
to one of our agents last night.

39:12.750 --> 39:16.038
If anyone has any information
regarding this subject,

39:16.040 --> 39:19.578
please contact
your local FBI office immediately.

39:19.580 --> 39:21.662
No, no, no, no.

39:26.540 --> 39:28.030
Rebecca?

39:28.540 --> 39:31.703
I'm afraid I must go out again.

39:34.620 --> 39:38.408
A Pale Clouded Yellow butterfly
indigenous to Great Britain?

39:38.750 --> 39:40.160
How's it going?

39:40.170 --> 39:42.320
The answer to what book
we need has to be in here.

39:42.330 --> 39:45.037
-Yeah, but we sure as hell can't see it.
-Yet.

39:46.120 --> 39:47.610
-Elle?
-I'm awake.

39:47.620 --> 39:50.202
-I'm sending you home.
-No.

39:50.210 --> 39:52.610
You need to get some rest,
and we won't do anything without you.

39:52.620 --> 39:53.826
-I promise.
-Elle, seriously,

39:53.830 --> 39:56.572
we're not any closer than we were.
Get out of here. Go home.

39:56.580 --> 39:58.571
-But. ..
-It's an order.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.496
Let's go.

40:11.170 --> 40:12.205
Come on.

40:14.080 --> 40:16.992
-Anderson, take Greenaway home.
-Yes, sir.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.912
-No, I'm fine.
-I'll have your car brought over later.

40:19.920 --> 40:22.206
All right, come on, Anderson.

40:22.960 --> 40:25.030
-Get some sleep.
-Yeah.

40:29.750 --> 40:33.288
I sent Elle home with Anderson.
She hasn't slept in 36 hours.

40:34.250 --> 40:35.569
Good.

41:55.120 --> 41:58.669
-I told you there was one rule.
-No.

41:58.670 --> 42:02.208
One rule, Agent Greenaway.

42:02.210 --> 42:04.781
-Stop.
-Do you not consider

42:04.790 --> 42:08.829
that holding a press conference
is going outside the team for help?

42:08.830 --> 42:10.491
-Listen.
-One rule!

42:10.500 --> 42:12.115
Listen to me!
We can talk about this.

42:12.120 --> 42:14.372
I told you this was important!
