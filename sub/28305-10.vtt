WEBVTT

00:01.653 --> 00:03.003
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, boy, oh, boy. You'll recall

00:03.046 --> 00:04.743
we last left our Jane
working with her father

00:04.787 --> 00:05.744
onThis Is Mars, which,
you'll recall, was a remake

00:05.788 --> 00:07.529
ofThe Passions
of Steve and Brenda,

00:07.572 --> 00:10.271
which, of course, was a remake
ofThe Passions of Santos.

00:10.314 --> 00:13.100
But the creative juices
weren't flowing for everyone.

00:13.143 --> 00:16.799
Mateo is really struggling
with his reading.

00:16.842 --> 00:18.714
He is quite far behind
the rest of the class.

00:18.757 --> 00:19.802
Just read a lot to him.

00:19.845 --> 00:22.109
Play word games.
Just engage him.

00:22.152 --> 00:24.720
And so Jane and Rafael tried
to put their feelings aside

00:24.763 --> 00:26.939
to focus on their son.Art?

00:26.983 --> 00:29.072
But this was easier said
than done for poor Jane.

00:29.116 --> 00:32.554
See, she still loved Rafael,
but he'd moved on,

00:32.597 --> 00:34.817
and Jane was trying to as well.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.558
JANE:
It was the first time
I've been with him in weeks

00:36.601 --> 00:38.212
where my heart
didn't just break.

00:38.255 --> 00:40.475
It was brief, but still,
there was a moment.

00:40.518 --> 00:42.390
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Also trying to move forward?

00:42.433 --> 00:44.218
Petra and J.R. See,

00:44.261 --> 00:45.741
J.R. lost her job
because Petra had lied.

00:45.784 --> 00:48.570
But they decided
to work through it.

00:48.613 --> 00:50.224
Aw, I heart them.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.400
Only problem?RAMOS: My mentor.

00:52.443 --> 00:54.315
She thinks she found me
a job opportunity.

00:54.358 --> 00:55.968
What? That's amazing.

00:56.012 --> 00:58.667
Thing is, the job's in Houston.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.234
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Also facing a big decision...

01:00.277 --> 01:03.193
Rafael and Jane let Mateo meet
his Aunt Luisa.

01:03.237 --> 01:05.021
But unfortunately...DENNIS: Rafael.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.676
It's Dennis. Do you know
where your sister is?

01:07.719 --> 01:09.199
Yes, I do.

01:09.243 --> 01:10.461
Well, we just found out

01:10.505 --> 01:12.289
that all the money
from Rose's Satin Road

01:12.333 --> 01:14.204
was funneled into an account
under her name.

01:14.248 --> 01:15.901
We think they're still
working together.

01:15.945 --> 01:18.078
I know!
Straight out of a telenovela,

01:18.121 --> 01:20.254
which this is, after all.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.954
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva
was 30 years old...

01:24.997 --> 01:26.129
I'm pregnant. Huh?

01:29.176 --> 01:30.525
Wait, what?

01:30.568 --> 01:32.396
I didn't even have sex.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.528
Okay, now I'm really confused.

01:33.571 --> 01:34.746
ROGELIO:
Jane!

01:34.790 --> 01:37.053
I have big news.

01:38.402 --> 01:39.969
Ah, I see.

01:40.012 --> 01:42.363
She's writing her novel.

01:42.406 --> 01:44.974
Sorry, I lost focus
for a second.

01:45.017 --> 01:47.585
Juggling a lot of things.So?

01:47.629 --> 01:49.457
What are you working on?

01:49.500 --> 01:51.459
Since Alba and Jorge
are on their honeymoon,

01:51.502 --> 01:54.201
I'm taking advantage of the
quiet time to work on my novel.

01:54.244 --> 01:55.202
Well, quiet time is over!

01:55.245 --> 01:57.029
The network liked your

01:57.073 --> 01:59.031
This Is Marsoutline so much,

01:59.075 --> 02:02.426
they want you
to write the pilot script.

02:02.470 --> 02:05.647
What? That's amazing.
Oh, my God.

02:05.690 --> 02:06.909
Are you serious?

02:11.479 --> 02:14.264
Mm!
So amazing.

02:14.308 --> 02:16.527
They did insist,
however,

02:16.571 --> 02:18.616
that you be paired
with a senior writer.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.618
Just to help guide you.

02:20.662 --> 02:23.621
Oh, I'll take all the guidance
I can get. Who'd they hire?

02:23.665 --> 02:27.190
It's actually Dina, since she
worked on the original Santos.

02:27.234 --> 02:30.976
Really? Dina's willing
to work with you again?

02:31.020 --> 02:32.195
Well...

02:32.239 --> 02:34.023
No way in hell.

02:34.066 --> 02:36.330
You never respected
me as a writer.

02:36.373 --> 02:38.462
I was constantly putting out
fires you created,

02:38.506 --> 02:40.334
and you cut me out

02:40.377 --> 02:42.031
of your American version
of The Passions of Santos

02:42.074 --> 02:43.554
even though I created it.

02:43.598 --> 02:46.470
To be honest, she called
the prospect of working with me

02:46.514 --> 02:50.518
again "a real life low."

02:50.561 --> 02:53.738
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And that was after she called
him "a real lowlife."

02:53.782 --> 02:56.741
But money talks,
and the network met her price.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.700
So get ready to live on Mars.

03:09.754 --> 03:11.539
Uh, one more thing.

03:11.582 --> 03:12.757
Hmm.

03:12.801 --> 03:13.932
$7,500?

03:13.976 --> 03:15.934
Holy crap.

03:15.978 --> 03:19.242
I can... I can
actually pay my bills.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.766
And you'll get more
when you finish the script.

03:21.810 --> 03:23.725
Though, of course, you'll
have to split it with Dina.

03:23.768 --> 03:26.249
That's fine with me,
I'm just, uh...

03:26.293 --> 03:27.946
RAMOS:
So overwhelmed.

03:27.990 --> 03:30.079
You're right,
taking out the sweaters.

03:30.122 --> 03:32.342
See? I have no idea
what to pack.

03:32.386 --> 03:34.779
I mean, I've never
even been to Houston.

03:34.823 --> 03:37.217
What am I supposed to do there?

03:37.260 --> 03:40.263
Eat barbecue
and talk about the Astros?

03:40.307 --> 03:42.570
PETRA:
Always a good idea to talk
about football in Texas.

03:42.613 --> 03:46.487
The Astros are
baseball, not football.

03:46.530 --> 03:49.229
Same difference.

03:49.272 --> 03:52.841
You know, it's funny,
I never saw myself

03:52.884 --> 03:56.671
working for a non-profit,
or in public policy,

03:56.714 --> 03:59.282
but...

03:59.326 --> 04:04.244
I should at least
go check it out, right?

04:04.287 --> 04:05.767
Yes, absolutely.

04:05.810 --> 04:07.421
This is a really
good opportunity,

04:07.464 --> 04:10.424
and you shouldn't
second-guess it.

04:10.467 --> 04:13.253
What's taking you
so long in there?Here I come.

04:16.647 --> 04:19.998
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, hey,
it's Houston Petra, y'all.

04:23.175 --> 04:25.221
Wow.I wanted to show you

04:25.265 --> 04:27.092
that when I come to Houston,
I can fit

04:27.136 --> 04:29.443
right in with all
your new friends.

04:29.486 --> 04:31.314
You're really sweet...

04:32.446 --> 04:34.056
...and so crazy.

04:34.099 --> 04:37.538
Look, if we have to do
long distance, we will.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.888
I'm sorry, Petra, that hair...

04:39.931 --> 04:42.325
Oh, I'm not Petra.

04:42.369 --> 04:44.458
No, I'm Patti, tonight.

04:44.501 --> 04:47.417
Well, come here, Patti.

04:47.461 --> 04:49.419
MARLENE:
I'm so into this.

04:49.463 --> 04:51.726
The writing is great,
the story moves,

04:51.769 --> 04:53.249
this first chapter just works.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.772
Who is your mentor?

04:54.816 --> 04:57.427
Oh, right, me.

04:57.471 --> 05:00.604
Marlene, what has gotten
into you? You're so happy.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.693
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, I don't think
I've ever seen

05:02.737 --> 05:05.000
Marlene's teeth before.
They are white.

05:05.043 --> 05:07.437
Because the writing is so great.

05:08.612 --> 05:12.007
Okay, and I also
have a new lover!

05:12.050 --> 05:14.705
But really, I would
have been this happy anyway,

05:14.749 --> 05:16.359
because of your writing.

05:16.403 --> 05:18.492
Okay, a click less happy
but still very happy.

05:18.535 --> 05:20.189
You're doing
great, Jane.

05:20.232 --> 05:21.277
Keep it up.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.497
Thank you. I-I plan to.

05:23.540 --> 05:25.499
Although,
now I have to divide my time

05:25.542 --> 05:28.589
between my novel
and my dad's telenovela.

05:28.632 --> 05:30.373
Oh, well, don't lose focus
on your novel.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.680
Because I would love to show it
to a friend in the industry.

05:32.723 --> 05:34.595
Really? That would be...Okay, okay.

05:34.638 --> 05:36.858
The friend is actually my lover.

05:36.901 --> 05:39.687
She's in publishing,
and she's a genius.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.732
That's amazing.She's amazing.

05:41.776 --> 05:44.909
You're amazing.
Write that novel, you have to.

05:44.953 --> 05:47.564
I will. I will work on it
in the mornings,

05:47.608 --> 05:49.392
and the telenovela
in the afternoons.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.394
I will have new material
for you to show your lover

05:51.438 --> 05:53.048
in a couple weeks.

05:53.091 --> 05:55.224
Great. We'll probably
be married by then.

05:55.267 --> 05:56.747
Oh!
I'm kidding.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.401
Oh, maybe I'm not. Ah!

05:58.445 --> 05:59.881
Okay, I got to go.

05:59.924 --> 06:01.317
I have a meeting
with Mateo's teacher.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.972
He's having trouble
learning to read.

06:04.015 --> 06:05.190
Oh, that's funny,

06:05.234 --> 06:07.236
because you're a writer.

06:07.279 --> 06:09.064
Yeah, funny.

06:09.107 --> 06:10.935
Hadn't thought of that.

06:13.329 --> 06:15.505
You seem a little
wired this morning.

06:15.549 --> 06:17.812
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR :
Maybehe has a new lover.

06:17.855 --> 06:20.423
I am just excited.

06:20.467 --> 06:23.339
I am close to selling
my first million dollar house,

06:23.383 --> 06:24.688
and there is a couple coming

06:24.732 --> 06:27.299
for their second appointment
this week.

06:27.343 --> 06:29.476
Ms. Everette, hi.Thanks for coming in.

06:29.519 --> 06:30.781
Thank you.
Of course.So I just thought

06:30.825 --> 06:32.261
we should discuss
Mateo's progress.

06:32.304 --> 06:34.959
Great. We wanted to
check in, too. At home,

06:35.003 --> 06:37.614
his rhyming is improving, but
he'd still rather build castles

06:37.658 --> 06:39.790
with his flashcards
than do his work.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.575
Yeah, but who wouldn't?I wouldn't.

06:41.618 --> 06:43.533
Besides you.Well, one
of the reasons

06:43.577 --> 06:46.841
I called you in is because I'm
wondering whether there might be

06:46.884 --> 06:49.539
something else
going on with Mateo.

06:49.583 --> 06:50.975
There's no cause
for alarm,

06:51.019 --> 06:52.890
but sometimes
when kids are struggling

06:52.934 --> 06:54.718
more than they should,
just, you know,

06:54.762 --> 06:56.241
makes sense to have them tested.

06:57.286 --> 07:00.463
Uh, tested for what, exactly?

07:00.507 --> 07:03.597
Could be any number of things.
Could be a learning disability,

07:03.640 --> 07:05.555
it could be a sensory
processing disorder,

07:05.599 --> 07:07.775
ADHD, dyslexia,

07:07.818 --> 07:09.298
or it could be nothing at all.

07:09.341 --> 07:11.169
This just could be who Mateo is.

07:11.213 --> 07:12.780
But there's
enough red flags

07:12.823 --> 07:14.259
that I do think it's worthwhile,

07:14.303 --> 07:16.479
having him evaluated
by a professional.

07:20.309 --> 07:23.486
So, uh, I'll call the doctor
and make an appointment today.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.575
You really think
that's necessary?

07:25.619 --> 07:26.750
He's only six.

07:26.794 --> 07:28.143
And the teacher
said it herself,

07:28.186 --> 07:30.145
it all might just be
his personality.

07:30.188 --> 07:32.930
But she also said she thought
Mateo should get tested.

07:32.974 --> 07:35.629
Well, I don't want to. No.

07:35.672 --> 07:37.500
Wait, what do you mean, "No"?

07:37.544 --> 07:39.328
He's just a kid
with a lot of energy.

07:39.371 --> 07:41.025
I had a lot of energy
when I was a kid.

07:41.069 --> 07:43.767
Uh, boys in general
have a lot of energy.

07:43.811 --> 07:46.291
Great, so then what's the harm
of getting him tested?

07:46.335 --> 07:47.989
Because they'll find something,
even if there's nothing to find.

07:48.032 --> 07:50.121
People these days, they hand out
diagnoses like Halloween candy.

07:50.165 --> 07:53.168
I'm sorry,
but I am putting my foot down.

07:53.211 --> 07:55.475
You're putting your foot down?

07:55.518 --> 07:57.912
He is not getting tested,
end of story.

07:59.043 --> 08:02.307
Now I got to get back to work.

08:02.351 --> 08:03.700
"End of story."

08:03.744 --> 08:05.528
Well, you know what?

08:05.572 --> 08:09.184
I'm the writer,
I'll end the story.

08:09.227 --> 08:11.186
Hi, this is Jane Villanueva.
I'd like to make

08:11.229 --> 08:14.189
an urgent appointment for my son
as soon as possible.

08:14.232 --> 08:16.365
Yes, I'll hold.

08:21.022 --> 08:22.589
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Man, I can't believe Jane made

08:22.632 --> 08:25.417
that doctor's appointment
behind Rafael's back.

08:25.461 --> 08:26.723
Oops. Wrong appointment.

08:26.767 --> 08:27.942
Boy, I really got to focus.

08:27.985 --> 08:29.509
Hi, good to see you.

08:29.552 --> 08:31.293
Let's jump in. I have
a lot of notes, and we need

08:31.336 --> 08:34.557
to turn a finished script in
to the studio in two weeks.

08:34.601 --> 08:35.689
Wow, that fast, huh?

08:35.732 --> 08:37.473
Yeah. That's how it works in TV.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.780
Everybody's on deadline
all the time, and we need to do

08:39.823 --> 08:41.477
rounds and rounds
of rewrites for the studio

08:41.521 --> 08:42.870
and then again
for the network.

08:42.913 --> 08:44.088
The work never stops.

08:45.176 --> 08:46.264
Is that too much for you?

08:46.308 --> 08:47.744
Of course not.
Agreed.

08:47.788 --> 08:49.441
Of course not. I'm
excited to get started.

08:49.485 --> 08:51.008
ROGELIO: All right,
the dream team.

08:51.052 --> 08:54.795
With your talent and passion
combined with Dina's

08:54.838 --> 08:57.449
decades of experience...One more thing.

08:57.493 --> 08:59.843
I will only speak to you.

08:59.887 --> 09:02.150
Any thoughts
your dad may have

09:02.193 --> 09:05.240
must only be relayed
through you.

09:05.283 --> 09:06.110
What?

09:08.635 --> 09:11.420
Uh, ask her "What?"

09:11.463 --> 09:13.901
What?
No need for "what."
You got it.

09:13.944 --> 09:17.165
Now your father needs to leave
so I can give you my notes.

09:17.208 --> 09:20.690
Dina, I assure you,
I'll be nothing but...Jane?

09:20.734 --> 09:22.910
Is someone speaking?

09:22.953 --> 09:25.390
You know what, Dad? Maybe
it's best if you go.

09:25.434 --> 09:27.915
Dina and I can take
care of it from here.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.047
Uh...

09:30.091 --> 09:32.093
Of course.Okay.

09:40.318 --> 09:42.103
Dad...

09:43.234 --> 09:45.628
Okay. Let's get to work.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.370
It worked.

09:48.413 --> 09:50.198
Our scientists did it.

09:50.241 --> 09:53.636
They've made the air
sustainable for life,

09:53.680 --> 09:56.247
which resulted in this...

09:56.291 --> 09:57.640
Wow...

09:57.684 --> 10:00.600
...the first-ever
Martian flower.

10:00.643 --> 10:03.951
It is an amazing achievement
for our administration.

10:03.994 --> 10:06.431
Wow. This should be the symbol

10:06.475 --> 10:08.782
on the new
Martian-American flag.

10:08.825 --> 10:11.523
Crumple it.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.743
Crumple the flower.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.484
Don't listen to
that Earth child.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.660
You can't crumple the
first Martian flower.

10:17.704 --> 10:20.315
See?

10:20.358 --> 10:22.317
That's what happens
to your virginity.

10:22.360 --> 10:25.886
Once it's gone,
you can never, ever get it back.

10:25.929 --> 10:27.627
Please,
it's a little late for that.

10:27.670 --> 10:30.891
My flower's been crumpled
for 96 Martian years.

10:30.934 --> 10:34.459
What is she talking about?
What is this?

10:50.519 --> 10:52.086
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Good, Jane.

10:52.129 --> 10:54.349
Focus on the telenovela.

10:54.392 --> 10:56.656
RAFAEL:
Flowers are not gonna make
me forgive you, Luisa.

10:56.699 --> 11:00.703
Your signature was
all over Rose's bank accounts.

11:00.747 --> 11:04.576
The woman can forge faces, I'm
sure she can forge a signature.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.840
I promise,
I'm not part of...

11:06.883 --> 11:09.712
whatever criminal things
she's doing.And I don't believe you.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.758
You have lied
too many times before.

11:11.801 --> 11:13.368
But I'm not lying now.

11:13.411 --> 11:16.414
Come on, Rafael.
Think of how far we've come.

11:16.458 --> 11:19.243
I'm sorry. Rose is too
dangerous. I can't risk it.

11:22.769 --> 11:25.380
How did it go?
Did he believe you?

11:25.423 --> 11:26.860
No.

11:26.903 --> 11:29.253
Well, don't give up, girl.

11:29.297 --> 11:30.690
Get him some proof
that you're innocent.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.736
You're so sweet to care so much.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.217
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, sweet, or diabolical,

11:36.260 --> 11:39.046
conniving and working for
your psychopath ex-girlfriend.

11:39.089 --> 11:41.875
Oh, you know
who you have to go see?Who?

11:41.918 --> 11:43.877
Your psychopath ex-girlfriend.

11:43.920 --> 11:44.791
"Sociopath."

11:44.834 --> 11:46.227
Oh, my bad. Mine, too.

11:46.270 --> 11:47.619
Maybe she could
help with proof.

11:47.663 --> 11:49.578
No. It's too hard
for me to see her.

11:49.621 --> 11:51.275
That woman's all hair
and cheekbones.

11:51.319 --> 11:53.408
Luisa, you are stronger
than you know.

11:53.451 --> 11:55.584
And your brother's
worth it, right?

11:55.627 --> 11:57.804
Come on. You got this, girl.

11:57.847 --> 11:59.240
PETRA:
Girls, Mommy needs

11:59.283 --> 12:00.458
some privacy. Stay in your room

12:00.502 --> 12:03.984
and play with your toys.

12:04.027 --> 12:05.812
RAMOS :
You've reached Jane Ramos.

12:05.855 --> 12:07.988
Please leave a message.Hey, J.R.,

12:08.031 --> 12:09.946
it's me. I'm-I'm sorry
I keep missing you.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.774
Call me back when you can.

12:11.818 --> 12:12.949
Oh, it's, uh,

12:12.993 --> 12:14.864
it's Patti, by the way.

12:14.908 --> 12:17.214
Who's Patti?:
Don't you knock?

12:17.258 --> 12:20.000
I did.
I guess Patti didn't hear me.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.610
Okay, well...

12:21.653 --> 12:24.221
if you must know,
J.R. is in Houston right now,

12:24.265 --> 12:25.832
and we haven't spoken
since she left.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.790
We keep missing each other.I'm sorry.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.097
That sucks. And Patti?

12:30.140 --> 12:31.446
Never mind about Patti.
Look, the girls

12:31.489 --> 12:32.708
will be ready for you
in a second. Girls!

12:32.752 --> 12:34.797
Uh-- stop playing. Let's go!

12:34.841 --> 12:36.799
Oh, I should warn you,
they're obsessed

12:36.843 --> 12:38.453
with their new circuit builder.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.107
They can't focus
on anything else.

12:40.150 --> 12:42.500
Maybe we should
have them tested, too.

12:43.588 --> 12:45.765
Uh, Mateo's teacher suggested

12:45.808 --> 12:47.810
getting him tested
for a learning disability

12:47.854 --> 12:50.073
or an attention thing
and Jane's all for it.

12:50.117 --> 12:53.207
But it's ridiculous,
because there's nothing wrong.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.164
Really?

12:54.208 --> 12:56.210
He's six. He's rambunctious.

12:56.253 --> 12:57.820
Or there's a real problem

12:57.864 --> 12:59.953
that needs to be addressed.There isn't.

12:59.996 --> 13:02.346
Rafael, your daughters
are in therapy,

13:02.390 --> 13:03.826
you're on antidepressants.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.350
Your son may also need
some professional help.

13:07.656 --> 13:10.964
Okay, look, I know
it's hard, all right?

13:11.007 --> 13:13.618
But, hey, as Patti would say,

13:13.662 --> 13:16.317
when you dig a ditch,
that dirt's got to go somewhere.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.319
What the hell does that mean?:
It means

13:18.362 --> 13:20.495
get over yourself and have Mateo
take the damn test.

13:24.716 --> 13:27.981
Okay, so I thought
about what you said,

13:28.024 --> 13:29.852
and I think
you're right.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.462
We should get Mateo tested.

13:31.506 --> 13:32.942
So, I will

13:32.986 --> 13:34.161
call the doctor.

13:34.204 --> 13:36.685
Oh, no, wait, um... I'll do it.

13:36.728 --> 13:38.295
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
She already did it!

13:38.339 --> 13:40.863
But later. I-I just want
to be in front of my computer

13:40.907 --> 13:43.213
so that I can take notes
if they say anything important.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.650
Oh, it's okay. I have a pen.
I'll just take notes.Um...

13:45.694 --> 13:48.828
You're gonna lose your tip.
Go. I'll handle this.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.703
Sorry.

13:54.746 --> 13:57.010
Hi, I'd like
to make an appointment.

13:57.053 --> 13:59.186
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Focus, Jane!

13:59.229 --> 14:02.842
Hey, hey, hey...Oh! Oh, oh--
shoot. Oh, sorry.

14:08.586 --> 14:10.762
Wow.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.808
What are the, uh, chances?

14:12.852 --> 14:14.984
They already have an appointment
scheduled for a boy

14:15.028 --> 14:18.161
named Mateo Gloriano Rogelio
Solano Villanueva.

14:18.205 --> 14:20.598
Who knew
it was such a popular name?

14:20.642 --> 14:22.731
You went behind my back?
Seriously?
It's just, uh,

14:22.774 --> 14:25.212
the doctor's really hard to get
into, so I didn't want to wait,

14:25.255 --> 14:27.997
plus, everything I've read
about these learning issues

14:28.041 --> 14:31.174
says that early diagnosis
is extremely important,

14:31.218 --> 14:33.611
and I just felt like you were
acting irrationally, so...

14:33.655 --> 14:34.786
Oh, so you're diagnosing me,
too, now, Doctor?

14:34.830 --> 14:36.527
I just meant...I don't want to hear it,

14:36.571 --> 14:37.964
I will see you at the test.

14:45.145 --> 14:48.148
And then he walked away.
Didn't even say bye.

14:48.191 --> 14:49.932
Yikes, that's bad.
Right?

14:49.976 --> 14:52.152
You just went behind his back
and made the appointment?

14:52.195 --> 14:54.154
I know, I know. It's awful.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.071
It's Marlene. Hey.

14:58.114 --> 14:59.681
Jane, I have to tell you
something,

14:59.724 --> 15:01.378
but you have to promise
not to get mad at me.

15:01.422 --> 15:02.727
I gave your pages to my lover!What...

15:02.771 --> 15:04.642
And my lover loved your pages

15:04.686 --> 15:07.210
and can't wait to see the next
installment in two weeks.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.865
Uh, wait, I-I won't be
done with it in two weeks.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.998
The telenovela writing
is taking up more of my time.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.738
No, Jane, you cannot
let the novel languish.

15:13.782 --> 15:17.917
Opportunities like this are
rare, and so is inspiration.

15:22.095 --> 15:23.705
You're right. Okay.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.054
Who needs sleep?

15:25.098 --> 15:27.883
Not me and Jill.
Now get to work.

15:32.453 --> 15:33.933
I'm beginning to think we need
to put our phone calls

15:33.976 --> 15:35.151
on the calendar if we're ever

15:35.195 --> 15:37.023
gonna be able to talk.I know.

15:37.066 --> 15:40.417
Long distance sucks.
But I do have 15 minutes before

15:40.461 --> 15:42.071
my next round of interviews.PETRA: Okay!

15:42.115 --> 15:43.943
What's the most important thing
for us to talk about?

15:43.986 --> 15:46.946
The people? The weather?
The chicken?

15:46.989 --> 15:52.777
Actually, I'm not really
in the mood to talk.

15:52.821 --> 15:54.779
Oh.

15:54.823 --> 15:57.130
Well, do you want me
to get Patti?

15:58.435 --> 16:01.438
No. I think I want Petra.

16:01.482 --> 16:04.528
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aw...

16:04.572 --> 16:07.053
Ooh, they nasty.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.452
What are you doing here?Uh, nothing.

16:15.496 --> 16:18.499
I-I, I wanted to talk to Petra
but sounds like she's busy,

16:18.542 --> 16:20.457
so I'll come back.What's going on out here?

16:20.501 --> 16:22.372
Nothing.She was spying on you.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.374
I wasn't.Mind your own business, Temp.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.811
And get me a water, I'm parched. I bet.

16:26.855 --> 16:30.293
Um, are you alone in here?

16:30.337 --> 16:32.295
Well, if you must know,

16:32.339 --> 16:34.123
J.R. and I were
just having FaceTime sex.

16:34.167 --> 16:35.690
Ooh.
Because out
of the blue,

16:35.733 --> 16:37.822
a job opportunity came up,
but it's in Houston.

16:37.866 --> 16:39.824
Houston.Yes. It's in immigration,

16:39.868 --> 16:41.478
and I'm really happy for her.

16:41.522 --> 16:43.480
Of course you are.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.743
Then again,
Houston is pretty far away.

16:45.787 --> 16:49.182
Oh, people make long distance
work all the time.Come on, Petra.

16:49.225 --> 16:50.835
Okay, fine. I'm terrified
of what will happen,

16:50.879 --> 16:52.663
but I can't stand in the way
of her happiness.

16:52.707 --> 16:54.883
Has J.R. looked
for immigration jobs in Miami?

16:54.926 --> 16:56.319
I don't know.

16:56.363 --> 16:57.668
It's worth a conversation.

16:57.712 --> 16:59.148
Speaking of jobs,

16:59.192 --> 17:00.758
can I have nights off
for the next two weeks?

17:00.802 --> 17:02.021
I need more writing time.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.152
Yeah, sure.

17:03.196 --> 17:04.806
How's the telenovela going?

17:04.849 --> 17:07.896
Yeah-- it's definitely
out there.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.551
Do not worry.

17:10.594 --> 17:12.422
I had our spacesuits customized

17:12.466 --> 17:14.772
so we could make
love in outer space.

17:14.816 --> 17:17.036
Oh, good. Thank God.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.173
It's okay, we're married.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.613
Who is this chick?

17:33.965 --> 17:35.967
Dios mío!

17:39.536 --> 17:40.929
Wha...?

17:49.503 --> 17:52.201
How's it going?

17:52.245 --> 17:55.509
Eh, balancing the novel
and the telenovela

17:55.552 --> 17:57.946
is turning out to be
a lot harder than I thought.

17:57.989 --> 17:59.426
Oh-- don't worry,

17:59.469 --> 18:01.341
I won't let Dad down.

18:01.384 --> 18:03.647
I'll just put the novel aside
for a while,

18:03.691 --> 18:06.085
and focus on finishing
the telenovela.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.564
And you're okay with that?

18:07.608 --> 18:11.220
Of course. Ready to go,
Mr. Sweetface? Mwah.

18:15.311 --> 18:16.878
JANE: Do you remember
what we talked about earlier?

18:16.921 --> 18:18.880
You're gonna have a fun day.

18:18.923 --> 18:22.231
And you get to play fun games,
and a lot of kids do this,

18:22.275 --> 18:26.975
so don't worry, 'cause it's
gonna be really, really fun.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.194
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Maybe overselling the fun...

18:28.237 --> 18:30.892
And when you're done,
we can go get ice cream.

18:30.935 --> 18:32.894
Hey.

18:32.937 --> 18:34.896
Hi, guys.Hi.

18:34.939 --> 18:36.811
So the evaluation will
take about three hours.

18:36.854 --> 18:38.117
Feel free to go
get a cup of coffee

18:38.160 --> 18:39.988
and come back when
it's all done.

18:40.031 --> 18:40.989
BOTH:
Thank you.

18:41.032 --> 18:42.730
Ready, Mateo?

18:42.773 --> 18:44.732
Bye, Mr. Sweetface. Mwah.

18:44.775 --> 18:46.951
See you soon, buddy.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.218
I'm really sorry.

18:52.261 --> 18:54.655
I-I know I overstepped.

18:54.698 --> 18:57.788
Yeah, you're right, which is why
I've decided to get a lawyer,

18:57.832 --> 18:59.486
so we can adjust our custody
agreement to make sure

18:59.529 --> 19:01.444
you never make another
medical decision for Mateo

19:01.488 --> 19:03.011
without my input again.

19:04.317 --> 19:07.146
Uh, uh...

19:08.234 --> 19:09.626
A lawyer?

19:09.670 --> 19:11.889
U-Uh, isn't that
a little extreme?

19:11.933 --> 19:14.153
Rafael, can we at least talk?No.

19:14.196 --> 19:15.980
What do you mean, "No"?

19:16.024 --> 19:17.982
I mean, I have to open a house
to potential buyers,

19:18.026 --> 19:20.202
and I got a bunch
of muffins in my trunk.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.986
Muffins? Is that a euphemism?

19:22.030 --> 19:24.815
I'll be back to pick up my son
after the evaluation.

19:24.859 --> 19:26.339
Wait, you can't
just leave like that.

19:28.384 --> 19:30.081
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Don't do it, Jane.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.910
Just focus on Mateo.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.044
Oh, no.

19:36.087 --> 19:37.872
Looks like we got ourselves
a high-speed car chase.

19:39.743 --> 19:42.529
Well, more like
a "going the speed limit

19:42.572 --> 19:44.226
and obeying stop signs" chase.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.446
Are you chasing me?

19:46.489 --> 19:48.622
JANE:
Yes! Because it's not okay

19:48.665 --> 19:50.798
to say something like,
"I'm getting a lawyer,"

19:50.841 --> 19:52.234
and then run away.

19:52.278 --> 19:53.844
Oh, but it's okay
to go behind my back

19:53.888 --> 19:54.976
to make a major medical decision

19:55.019 --> 19:56.238
about our son?

19:56.282 --> 19:58.240
I understand
that you're upset with me,

19:58.284 --> 20:00.938
but I really don't think
we need to get lawyers involved.

20:00.982 --> 20:02.549
Go screw yourself!

20:02.592 --> 20:04.246
Are you kidding me right now?

20:04.290 --> 20:06.248
You cannot talk to me like that.

20:06.292 --> 20:07.771
No, I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to the guy

20:07.815 --> 20:09.730
in front of me driving
like a complete ass!

20:09.773 --> 20:11.471
Maybe if you weren't driving
like a maniac...

20:11.514 --> 20:12.950
RAFAEL:
See you, sucker.

20:12.994 --> 20:15.344
Was that to someone else?Nope.

20:15.388 --> 20:17.390
Rafael, can we please
talk about this?

20:24.310 --> 20:26.094
RAFAEL: Damn it.Are you okay?

20:26.137 --> 20:27.138
Yeah. I got
into a fender bender.

20:35.277 --> 20:36.496
Are you hurt?RAFAEL:
No, I'm fine.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.062
But I have a showing
and now I have

20:38.106 --> 20:39.368
to wait for the police
to show up.

20:39.412 --> 20:41.283
Let me go to the house.

20:41.327 --> 20:42.980
What?Text me the address and I'll

20:43.024 --> 20:44.591
stall the buyers
until you get there.

20:44.634 --> 20:46.070
Just give me your muffins.

20:46.114 --> 20:48.595
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us to...

20:48.638 --> 20:50.161
Jane the Realtor.

20:50.205 --> 20:53.034
Oh, uh,
we were expecting...

20:53.077 --> 20:54.514
Mr. Solano, I know.

20:54.557 --> 20:58.126
I'm his associate, uh,
he should be here any minute.

20:58.169 --> 21:00.128
Uh, but, he just asked me
to show you around.

21:00.171 --> 21:01.651
Great. Well, I'm excited
to show

21:01.695 --> 21:03.740
my husband Kenny the place.
He missed the open house,

21:03.784 --> 21:05.307
but I absolutely
fell in love with it.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.048
KENNY:
Can't wait. Let's see it.

21:07.091 --> 21:09.659
Sure. Uh, but first

21:09.703 --> 21:12.662
would you like to just
take a beat and enjoy a muffin?

21:12.706 --> 21:14.882
No, thanks.
Just the tour.

21:14.925 --> 21:16.405
Great.

21:16.449 --> 21:20.061
Uh, well, um, th-this here
is the living room.

21:20.104 --> 21:23.107
As you can see,
it is very... roomy,

21:23.151 --> 21:25.588
uh, really built for living.

21:26.633 --> 21:27.895
Right.

21:27.938 --> 21:31.681
And, uh, over here we have...

21:31.725 --> 21:34.118
the bathroom.

21:34.162 --> 21:36.425
I-I, I don't know why
I said that so surprised.

21:36.469 --> 21:38.297
It's a bathroom.

21:39.820 --> 21:42.605
What year was this house built?

21:42.649 --> 21:44.694
Mmm...

21:44.738 --> 21:46.957
uh...

21:47.001 --> 21:47.958
why don't you take a guess?

21:48.002 --> 21:48.959
MORGAN:
Uh...

21:49.003 --> 21:50.004
the '90s?

21:51.005 --> 21:53.224
Ding, ding, ding!

21:53.268 --> 21:55.009
Good eye.

21:56.489 --> 21:58.578
Oh, look! Here we have a...

21:58.621 --> 22:00.449
another bathroom.

22:00.493 --> 22:01.798
Why don't you check
this one out?

22:01.842 --> 22:03.626
You know, take your time.

22:03.670 --> 22:05.628
You know, feel free to check
the water pressure,

22:05.672 --> 22:07.500
really get to know the space.
I'll wait out here.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.823
I'd love to know
the walkability score.Uh...

22:26.867 --> 22:28.651
yes, that-that
is good to know.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.349
Um... I can
personally attest

22:30.392 --> 22:32.351
that it's
very... flat.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.353
Like most of Florida.

22:34.396 --> 22:36.050
You know, easy to
walk here. No hills.

22:36.093 --> 22:39.053
I meant access to local shops
and restaurants.

22:39.096 --> 22:41.403
Of course, I was just
getting to that.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.187
Excellent access.

22:43.231 --> 22:46.016
Yeah, you can,
you can really

22:46.060 --> 22:48.410
get to so many
things, um...

22:48.454 --> 22:50.934
gas stations,
coffee shops,

22:50.978 --> 22:52.936
other stores.LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hurry up, Rafael.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.677
I can't watch this.

22:54.721 --> 22:56.766
So how much longer
is this gonna take?

22:58.115 --> 23:00.379
Never mind,
take your time.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.381
So, the microwave
is built into the cabinet.

23:02.424 --> 23:03.686
Pretty cool.

23:03.730 --> 23:08.996
Uh, a-as you can see,
the stove is, uh, gas.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.650
What about the HVAC?

23:10.693 --> 23:12.739
Is that gas
or electric?

23:12.782 --> 23:16.264
That is a great question.
You guys came prepared.

23:16.307 --> 23:17.657
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Someone had to.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.746
Let me just pull up the specs.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.187
What's wrong?
Is there something

23:26.230 --> 23:27.710
you're not telling us
about the HVAC?

23:27.754 --> 23:30.365
No, of course not.
The, the HVAC is amazing.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.933
Top of the line.
Have you tried the muffins?

23:32.976 --> 23:35.065
What my associate
is trying to say

23:35.109 --> 23:37.372
is that the HVAC was
just updated last year.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.853
It's eco-friendly and it uses
an electric heating coil.

23:39.896 --> 23:41.332
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, thank God, I was about

23:41.376 --> 23:43.291
to put in an offer
just to end this misery.

23:43.334 --> 23:45.598
They also have questions
about the walkability score.

23:45.641 --> 23:48.209
Hmm, 80, which is great.
Not only are you blocks

23:48.252 --> 23:49.471
from the grocery score,
but you could even

23:49.515 --> 23:50.733
walk to your
local elementary school.

23:50.777 --> 23:52.082
KENNY:
That's good to hear.

23:52.126 --> 23:54.520
But it is
in a flood zone.

23:54.563 --> 23:56.957
This is Miami.
Everything's in a flood zone.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.480
That's what insurance is for.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.177
RAFAEL:
Exactly.

24:00.221 --> 24:01.614
If you plan
when things are good,

24:01.657 --> 24:03.442
then you are covered
if things are bad.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.142
I mean, can't you
just imagine our son

24:08.185 --> 24:11.101
growing up here? We could
put in a swing set,

24:11.145 --> 24:12.451
there's plenty of
room in the den

24:12.494 --> 24:14.278
for his blanket forts,
and look at that tree--

24:14.322 --> 24:15.758
you've been wanting to
build a tree house forever.

24:15.802 --> 24:17.281
It's pretty idyllic.

24:17.325 --> 24:20.589
And as he gets older, he can
really grow into that room.

24:20.633 --> 24:22.286
Okay, let's do it.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.724
MORGAN:
We'll have our agent
put in the offer tonight.

24:24.767 --> 24:27.422
Perfect. Come on.
I'll walk you guys out.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.337
Yeah.

24:32.862 --> 24:36.213
Congratulations,
expert real estate guy.

24:38.781 --> 24:41.349
Sorry, but that was stressful
and I missed breakfast.

24:41.392 --> 24:43.960
Thanks for covering my ass.

24:44.004 --> 24:46.659
It was the
least I can do.

24:48.182 --> 24:50.445
And I'm so sorry...

24:50.489 --> 24:51.968
for going behind
your back.

24:52.012 --> 24:53.796
And for chasing you down
the streets of Miami.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.146
Obviously, we can
say without a doubt

24:56.190 --> 24:58.497
I'm in the wrong.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.849
That was really hard,
you know?
What?

25:02.892 --> 25:05.634
Hearing that couple talk
about their kid's future.

25:05.678 --> 25:07.375
Just kind of hit me.

25:07.418 --> 25:09.725
What if Mateo
really has an issue?

25:09.769 --> 25:10.987
We don't know
that he does.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.336
But what if he does?

25:12.380 --> 25:14.164
Then we'll deal with it.I know.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.688
But I think you just
want your kid to have,

25:15.731 --> 25:17.951
like, a normal life.

25:17.994 --> 25:19.474
Whatever that means.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.780
It will be.

25:20.823 --> 25:22.172
His normal.

25:23.347 --> 25:25.480
Look, here's
what I know.

25:25.524 --> 25:28.962
Mateo is the same
amazing kid today

25:29.005 --> 25:30.354
as he was yesterday.

25:30.398 --> 25:32.922
And now it's just up
to us to figure out

25:32.966 --> 25:34.533
how we can support that
kid that we both love

25:34.576 --> 25:36.665
so much as best we can.

25:36.709 --> 25:38.406
And we will.

25:38.449 --> 25:40.930
Because no matter what,
we're in this together.

25:40.974 --> 25:43.542
And...

25:43.585 --> 25:45.587
I'm sorry I acted
like we weren't.

25:45.631 --> 25:48.547
You are forgiven.

25:48.590 --> 25:50.244
And thank you.

25:52.725 --> 25:55.205
Muffin bottom?

25:55.249 --> 25:56.816
Yeah.

26:00.341 --> 26:03.605
So, uh, one of us
should go pick up Mateo.

26:03.649 --> 26:05.215
The only thing
more traumatizing

26:05.259 --> 26:06.826
than a three-hour doctor
appointment is to get out

26:06.869 --> 26:09.045
to find out that your
parents forgot about you.

26:09.089 --> 26:11.874
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I can think of something
more traumatizing.

26:11.918 --> 26:13.702
Wow.

26:13.746 --> 26:15.356
Just...

26:15.399 --> 26:16.705
beautiful.

26:16.749 --> 26:18.402
My prison girlfriend

26:18.446 --> 26:19.839
has nothing on you.

26:19.882 --> 26:22.537
Oh. So you're dating?

26:22.581 --> 26:25.845
Mostly I just close my eyes
and pretend she's you.

26:25.888 --> 26:29.239
As flattering as that is...

26:29.283 --> 26:31.067
that is not why I'm here.

26:32.286 --> 26:34.027
There are these bank documents,

26:34.070 --> 26:35.855
and my name is on them,
and obviously

26:35.898 --> 26:38.553
I never signed them, so I need
you to tell my brother that.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.250
I'll tell him whatever you want.

26:40.294 --> 26:41.817
Thank you.

26:41.861 --> 26:43.558
But you did sign them.What?

26:43.602 --> 26:45.168
No, I didn't.Remember that night

26:45.212 --> 26:47.910
on the submarine?

26:47.954 --> 26:50.434
When we dressed up
as Victoria's Secret Angels?

26:50.478 --> 26:52.219
In Liverpool?

26:52.262 --> 26:53.612
Madagascar.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.178
You were in the
Giselle sequin wings,

26:55.222 --> 26:58.007
I was in the Naomi feathers.

27:00.314 --> 27:02.621
You were drunk and
insecure about us.

27:02.664 --> 27:05.362
And I said I'd prove
my love to you

27:05.406 --> 27:07.538
by giving you everything I had?

27:07.582 --> 27:09.105
I gave you...

27:09.149 --> 27:11.542
all of my accounts.

27:11.586 --> 27:13.849
You signed the documents,
putting everything in your name.

27:13.893 --> 27:15.938
Oh, my God, I do remember.

27:18.506 --> 27:20.639
I signed the papers
and then that man that said

27:20.682 --> 27:22.292
that he works for
Paul Manafort came on board

27:22.336 --> 27:24.120
and took everything.Exactly.

27:24.164 --> 27:26.035
And after Michael
started sniffing around,

27:26.079 --> 27:28.124
I had to do something
to stop him, didn't I?

27:28.168 --> 27:29.560
So you...

27:29.604 --> 27:31.388
Would do anything
to protect you?

27:31.432 --> 27:33.782
Even though you're the
reason I'm in prison?

27:33.826 --> 27:35.871
Yes.

27:37.177 --> 27:39.222
Why are you trying
to claw your way

27:39.266 --> 27:41.703
back into Rafael's life
when you have someone

27:41.747 --> 27:43.313
who loves you?

27:43.357 --> 27:45.533
Unconditionally.

27:45.576 --> 27:47.361
I even sent someone
to watch over you.

27:48.449 --> 27:49.842
"Girl"?

27:49.885 --> 27:51.800
Girl. Girl. Girl.

27:51.844 --> 27:53.976
Go to him, Luisa.

27:54.020 --> 27:56.587
Then I'll know you love me, too.

27:59.765 --> 28:02.115
That will never happen.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.727
We'll see.

28:14.388 --> 28:17.565
Listen up,
everyone, focus.

28:17.608 --> 28:20.002
I assure you we are
addressing our oxygen shortage.

28:20.046 --> 28:22.613
Our Martian filters
will deliver

28:22.657 --> 28:24.615
breathable air
very soon.

28:24.659 --> 28:26.835
Yes, you.

28:26.879 --> 28:28.184
Mr. President,
what about the rumored affair

28:28.228 --> 28:30.447
with your interplanetary
ambassador?

28:30.491 --> 28:34.190
For the last time,
my relationship with Blooki

28:34.234 --> 28:36.192
is strictly professional.

28:36.236 --> 28:38.760
REPORTER:
So you deny the rumors?

28:38.804 --> 28:41.197
She doesn't even
have a mouth.

28:43.939 --> 28:45.288
What about the milkshake?

28:48.204 --> 28:49.292
I'm gonna have a baby?

28:49.336 --> 28:50.641
MATEO:
Yes, me, Mommy.

28:50.685 --> 28:52.818
Mom? Mommy.
What about me?

28:52.861 --> 28:53.993
I can't focus.

28:54.036 --> 28:55.603
Mommy, Mommy. Mommy!

28:55.646 --> 28:57.605
ALL :
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy...

28:57.648 --> 28:59.912
Oh, boy.

28:59.955 --> 29:01.783
Is it a bad time?

29:01.827 --> 29:04.394
Nope. Actually,
I can use a break.

29:04.438 --> 29:06.570
But don't worry,
I'll get Dina the pages.

29:06.614 --> 29:08.572
Actually, that's
why I'm here.

29:08.616 --> 29:10.183
Uh...

29:10.226 --> 29:12.707
I spoke to
your mother...

29:12.751 --> 29:14.753
and I want to let
you off the hook.

29:14.796 --> 29:17.016
What do you mean?Well, you can quit
the telenovela

29:17.059 --> 29:18.757
if you'd rather
be writing your novel.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.759
No, no. I-I'm just
feeling overwhelmed.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.456
There's a lot going on
right now.

29:22.499 --> 29:24.893
You won't hurt my feelings
if you don't want to do it.

29:24.937 --> 29:26.895
Thanks, Dad.

29:26.939 --> 29:29.289
But it's also a lot of money.

29:29.332 --> 29:32.727
Well, being paid
to make art is tricky.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.729
Money can buy a lot of things.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.426
But passion isn't one of them.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.733
You have to follow
your passion.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.604
And, frankly, I need

29:40.648 --> 29:43.390
someone who will live
and breathe the telenovela.

29:43.433 --> 29:45.261
Because this is my passion.

29:45.305 --> 29:47.873
My novel has been calling to me.

29:47.916 --> 29:50.440
Then answer the muse.
Dina will write the show.

29:50.484 --> 29:52.051
But she won't even speak to you.

29:52.094 --> 29:54.444
Let me worry about that.
You get your book done.

29:54.488 --> 29:56.751
PETRA:
Oh, thank God.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.666
I missed you so much.
Mmm.

29:58.709 --> 30:01.234
It's just been
a few days.
Mmm.

30:01.277 --> 30:03.497
I know, but I missed you
every minute of those days.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.847
Mmm.

30:05.891 --> 30:08.284
So?
Drumroll.

30:08.328 --> 30:10.112
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
On it.

30:10.156 --> 30:12.114
They offered me the job.

30:12.158 --> 30:13.507
Really?

30:13.550 --> 30:15.465
Congratulations.
Wait.

30:15.509 --> 30:16.945
That's not even
the biggest news.

30:16.989 --> 30:18.468
I got another job offer

30:18.512 --> 30:20.644
on the way back
from the airport.

30:20.688 --> 30:23.604
From the Florida
Immigrant Commission.

30:23.647 --> 30:25.171
Oh, that's great news.

30:25.214 --> 30:26.694
They don't even want
to interview me.

30:26.737 --> 30:29.697
They said I came
so highly recommended.

30:29.740 --> 30:31.830
Yes.

30:31.873 --> 30:34.658
By one of their biggest donors.

30:34.702 --> 30:37.139
Wait, you did this?

30:37.183 --> 30:38.793
I sit on the board

30:38.837 --> 30:41.491
of several charitable
organizations in Miami.

30:41.535 --> 30:43.319
When I learned
you were interested
in immigration policy,

30:43.363 --> 30:45.887
I put out feelers for any
similar opportunities here.

30:45.931 --> 30:48.847
Without asking me first?

30:48.890 --> 30:50.283
I thought you'd be happy.

30:50.326 --> 30:51.850
You don't have
to move to Houston.

30:51.893 --> 30:53.286
We don't have
to do long distance.

30:53.329 --> 30:55.897
I can't believe
you did that.

30:55.941 --> 30:57.333
There was a problem,
and I solved it.

30:57.377 --> 30:58.987
Wh-What's the issue?

30:59.031 --> 31:01.685
The issue is I want a
girlfriend, not a headhunter.

31:01.729 --> 31:04.514
Don't you think you've
done enough for my career?

31:04.558 --> 31:06.386
I was only trying to help.After what happened

31:06.429 --> 31:09.432
last time, your help is...

31:09.476 --> 31:10.999
the last thing I need.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.439
I know there's a lot
of anxiety for parents

31:16.483 --> 31:17.876
around this
whole process,

31:17.919 --> 31:19.529
so I'll cut
to the chase.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.836
I believe Mateo does have ADHD.

31:25.753 --> 31:27.276
I w...

31:27.320 --> 31:30.323
What does that mean
for him, specifically?

31:30.366 --> 31:32.542
Well, Mateo really struggles
with both inattention

31:32.586 --> 31:33.848
and impulsivity.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.241
His executive functions

31:35.284 --> 31:36.938
are somewhat impaired,
which is why

31:36.982 --> 31:40.942
tasks aren't completed, why he
has trouble self-regulating.

31:42.552 --> 31:44.554
It's just harder
for Mateo to focus

31:44.598 --> 31:46.861
and prioritize
than it is for other kids.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.515
How can we help him?

31:48.558 --> 31:50.038
Well, there are
treatment options that range

31:50.082 --> 31:52.780
from behavior interventions
to medication.

31:52.823 --> 31:54.651
I'm happy to go over
all of that with you.

31:54.695 --> 31:56.175
Thank you.

31:57.828 --> 32:00.135
Sorry, I...

32:00.179 --> 32:03.269
just trying to imagine
what it feels like for Mateo.

32:03.312 --> 32:06.011
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
You know what? Let me show you
what it feels like.

32:06.054 --> 32:07.926
Oh, wait, look at that.

32:07.969 --> 32:10.232
Whoops. Spoiler alert.

32:10.276 --> 32:11.755
Oh, hello, Alba.

32:11.799 --> 32:13.757
Ooh, pretty bug.

32:13.801 --> 32:16.325
Now, where were we?

32:20.112 --> 32:24.072
You okay?Yeah. Fine.

32:24.116 --> 32:25.595
Oh, come on.

32:25.639 --> 32:28.903
You were the strong one
for me yesterday.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.384
I promise I'm good,
so if you need to fall apart

32:31.427 --> 32:34.082
a little... I'm here.

32:34.126 --> 32:38.086
I'm just scared.

32:38.130 --> 32:40.436
And a little sad.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.612
Yeah, I know.

32:42.656 --> 32:46.965
I just want him
to have a good life.He will.

32:47.008 --> 32:48.923
I don't want it
to be harder.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.055
It might be.Oh...

32:50.098 --> 32:52.971
But, hey, that's
all he knows.

32:53.014 --> 32:56.235
I just keep thinking
about something

32:56.278 --> 32:58.367
a friend of mine said.

32:58.411 --> 33:01.501
How Mateo's the same great kid
today as he was yesterday.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.987
That friend sounds
super smart.

33:09.030 --> 33:11.641
She can be.

33:11.685 --> 33:15.689
We've got this.
Together.

33:23.349 --> 33:25.046
All right, I'm going to win Dina
over with this super-sized

33:25.090 --> 33:27.918
cupcake I made.
What do you think?

33:29.529 --> 33:30.834
Isn't that just a cake?

33:30.878 --> 33:33.359
It's-- oh.

33:33.402 --> 33:34.838
No baked goods,

33:34.882 --> 33:36.927
Rogelio, that won't help.

33:36.971 --> 33:38.929
Hey.

33:38.973 --> 33:40.235
Hey.

33:40.279 --> 33:42.020
You doing okay?

33:42.063 --> 33:43.847
How are you feeling about Mateo?

33:43.891 --> 33:47.895
Uh, I'm still processing,
but okay.

33:47.938 --> 33:49.157
Good.

33:49.201 --> 33:50.680
And you and Rafael?

33:50.724 --> 33:52.900
Also better.

33:52.943 --> 33:55.729
But we are adjusting
our custody agreement.

33:56.599 --> 33:57.557
It's kind of like

33:57.600 --> 33:58.558
homeowner's insurance.

33:58.601 --> 34:00.038
You get it when things are good

34:00.081 --> 34:01.604
to protect when things aren't.

34:03.215 --> 34:04.390
I think that's smart.

34:04.433 --> 34:07.567
And I also think
you look sad.

34:07.610 --> 34:09.569
I just don't want to prepare
for a future

34:09.612 --> 34:12.224
where Rafael and I
aren't together.

34:12.267 --> 34:15.444
But it's like Mateo's diagnosis.

34:15.488 --> 34:18.665
I don't like it, it's hard,
but I have to accept it.

34:18.708 --> 34:21.363
Relationships change,
people change.

34:21.407 --> 34:25.106
Yes. That's so true.

34:26.499 --> 34:28.066
And you know what?

34:28.109 --> 34:31.156
That's exactly why I don't need
this giant cupcake.

34:33.984 --> 34:36.726
I mean, I would
have had some.

34:38.859 --> 34:40.730
Oh.

34:43.298 --> 34:46.693
I was very clear. I will only
speak to you through Jane.

34:46.736 --> 34:49.435
I know. And that's actually
what I'm here about.

34:49.478 --> 34:51.698
Jane is no longer
working on this project.

34:51.741 --> 34:55.049
Therefore, is no longer
available to act as our buffer.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.442
Then I'm off the project.

34:56.485 --> 34:57.660
Please, Dina.

34:57.704 --> 35:00.054
I don't trust anyone else
to get it right.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.795
You were there
from the beginning,

35:01.838 --> 35:03.971
and you're the only one
who has the passion for it.

35:04.014 --> 35:05.277
Well, you should have
thought about that

35:05.320 --> 35:06.930
one of the numerous times
you so egregiously

35:06.974 --> 35:08.584
mistreated and disrespected me!

35:08.628 --> 35:11.935
You're right. I was a selfish
and inconsiderate man.

35:11.979 --> 35:14.199
But I've changed since
we last worked together.

35:14.242 --> 35:16.070
Why should I believe that?

35:16.114 --> 35:17.637
I thought you
might ask that,

35:17.680 --> 35:19.595
which is why it's not my word
I'm asking you to believe.

35:19.639 --> 35:21.119
It's theirs.

35:26.776 --> 35:27.995
I have also

35:28.038 --> 35:30.258
egregiously mistreated
and disrespected

35:30.302 --> 35:31.781
each of these women.

35:31.825 --> 35:34.175
He abandoned me for his career.

35:34.219 --> 35:37.657
He broke his contract
and ruined my reality show.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.137
He burned off my eyebrows,

35:39.180 --> 35:40.312
got my toe bitten off by a wolf,

35:40.355 --> 35:42.401
and paralyzed half my face.

35:42.444 --> 35:44.229
Oh, my God.

35:44.272 --> 35:46.013
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Geez, how is this guy
still standing?

35:46.056 --> 35:49.234
And yet they have
all forgiven me.

35:49.277 --> 35:50.583
I had a baby with him.

35:50.626 --> 35:52.411
I married him.

35:52.454 --> 35:55.153
I signed on to spend
the next seven to ten years

35:55.196 --> 35:56.937
of my life with him.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.765
And they did that because
I've grown and changed.

35:58.808 --> 36:01.420
Sort of.
A little.

36:01.463 --> 36:02.986
His heart's in the right place.

36:03.030 --> 36:04.988
ROGELIO:
Dina, I promise,

36:05.032 --> 36:06.860
if you decide to work with me
on this pilot,

36:06.903 --> 36:08.731
I will not repeat the mistakes
of the past.

36:08.775 --> 36:10.472
And because you have

36:10.516 --> 36:13.301
zero reason to believe the
words coming out of my mouth,

36:13.345 --> 36:16.957
I've even put it
in writing.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.351
I've made us a contract.
For insurance.

36:19.394 --> 36:21.527
So we have
rules in place

36:21.570 --> 36:23.181
in case things go bad.

36:23.224 --> 36:26.009
And these three women
are your guarantee

36:26.053 --> 36:27.489
that it
will be enforced.

36:27.533 --> 36:29.230
One toe out of line,

36:29.274 --> 36:31.058
and I will have these three
in my ear.

36:31.101 --> 36:33.495
I mean, seriously, like...

36:36.629 --> 36:37.891
...from every direction.

36:37.934 --> 36:38.935
Shut it, Rogelio!

36:42.722 --> 36:44.202
Okay.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.204
Yougot a deal.

36:46.247 --> 36:47.596
Thank you.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.511
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

36:49.555 --> 36:51.078
You won't regret this.

36:51.121 --> 36:53.123
To Mars we go.

36:54.473 --> 36:55.952
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, sorry.

36:55.996 --> 36:57.345
Lost focus for a second.

36:57.389 --> 36:58.651
Here we are.

36:58.694 --> 37:00.566
I didn't mean to overstep.

37:00.609 --> 37:02.263
I love you.

37:02.307 --> 37:05.048
I would never do anything
to undermine your happiness.

37:05.092 --> 37:06.963
I know I overreacted.

37:07.007 --> 37:09.444
Yeah, you were just
trying to help.

37:09.488 --> 37:12.360
Honestly, I think
I was just...

37:12.404 --> 37:15.711
looking for a fight.

37:15.755 --> 37:17.365
Why?

37:17.409 --> 37:19.062
Thing is...

37:19.106 --> 37:21.891
spending time in Houston
made me realize

37:21.935 --> 37:25.721
how much I need
a fresh start.

37:25.765 --> 37:28.681
Nobody there
knows my history

37:28.724 --> 37:31.074
or looks at me like
I'm a criminal or...

37:31.118 --> 37:32.728
a bartender.

37:32.772 --> 37:34.252
Really...

37:34.295 --> 37:36.689
the idea of starting over

37:36.732 --> 37:39.866
is even more appealing
than the job itself.

37:39.909 --> 37:41.259
Oh.

37:41.302 --> 37:43.043
I am so sorry.

37:43.086 --> 37:45.480
No. I get it.

37:45.524 --> 37:48.004
I understand the need
for a fresh start.

37:48.048 --> 37:50.180
We'll just...

37:50.224 --> 37:52.922
make long distance work.

37:52.966 --> 37:55.316
Patti's been begging me
for a comeback.

37:55.360 --> 37:59.277
No, I mean a...
complete fresh start.

38:00.713 --> 38:02.410
Being away for a few days

38:02.454 --> 38:04.107
helped me understand...

38:04.151 --> 38:06.588
that it's impossible
for me to look at you

38:06.632 --> 38:08.808
without seeing all
of our baggage.

38:08.851 --> 38:11.114
I've forgiven you,
but I want to put

38:11.158 --> 38:13.378
the trauma of this
past year behind me.

38:15.075 --> 38:17.991
And I can't do that
with you in my life.

38:18.034 --> 38:20.167
What?

38:20.210 --> 38:21.951
No.

38:21.995 --> 38:23.605
I'm so sorry.

38:23.649 --> 38:27.957
But I... need
to start over.

38:28.001 --> 38:31.657
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And as Petra's heart broke
into a million pieces,

38:31.700 --> 38:33.311
Jane was finally able

38:33.354 --> 38:35.791
to put the pieces
of her novel together.

38:35.835 --> 38:38.620
See, as soon as she cleared the distractions from her mind,

38:38.664 --> 38:41.623
her executive functions
began to, well...

38:41.667 --> 38:44.322
really function.

38:44.365 --> 38:45.453
Jane, I need to talk to you.

38:45.497 --> 38:47.455
I need you to lock
your front door.

38:47.499 --> 38:50.023
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, looks like Jane
included Petra in the novel.

38:50.066 --> 38:51.372
Jane!

38:51.416 --> 38:52.982
Oh, my bad.

38:53.026 --> 38:54.070
What's wrong? S-Sit.

38:56.203 --> 38:58.814
Can I use this rag?

38:58.858 --> 39:01.643
Well, that's my sweatshirt...

39:01.687 --> 39:05.343
J.R.'s taking the
job in Houston

39:05.386 --> 39:07.432
and she broke up with me,

39:07.475 --> 39:11.000
and I feel like someone cut
out a piece of my heart.

39:11.044 --> 39:12.828
Oh, Petra.

39:12.872 --> 39:14.308
I'm fine. I should go.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.179
I just thought
you'd want to know.

39:16.223 --> 39:18.268
Sit your butt back down here.

39:18.312 --> 39:20.401
You're not
going anywhere.

39:20.445 --> 39:23.926
Okay. Can I sleep
here tonight?

39:23.970 --> 39:25.972
Of course.
Just give me a second.

39:33.109 --> 39:36.417
You want to hear
something really stupid?

39:38.637 --> 39:41.248
I-I was gonna propose.

39:41.291 --> 39:43.424
Oh, no.

39:43.468 --> 39:45.644
Hey, it could be
a friendship ring.

39:45.687 --> 39:47.994
Ah, it's already engraved.

39:48.037 --> 39:49.909
"Petra and Jane."

39:53.216 --> 39:55.654
Thank you for letting
me stay here.

39:55.697 --> 39:58.352
That's what sisters are for.

39:58.396 --> 39:59.832
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aw.

39:59.875 --> 40:02.748
If only our story
could end there.

40:02.791 --> 40:05.664
But this is a telenovela
after all.

40:05.707 --> 40:07.448
Luisa, you have
to stop calling me.

40:07.492 --> 40:10.973
I just needed to tell you
something important.

40:11.017 --> 40:15.064
I did sign my name
to Rose's accounts.

40:15.108 --> 40:16.457
I knew it.

40:16.501 --> 40:18.067
You are such a liar.

40:18.111 --> 40:20.940
No, I wasn't lying.
I just didn't remember doing it.

40:20.983 --> 40:23.595
It was years ago when I was...
I was blackout drunk.

40:23.638 --> 40:25.466
Oh, of course.But I am not...

40:25.510 --> 40:27.729
still working with Rose.

40:27.773 --> 40:29.514
I promise.Luisa.

40:29.557 --> 40:31.646
Enough. I'm done.

40:31.690 --> 40:34.519
Don't come near me
or my family again.

40:41.526 --> 40:43.136
Hey, girl, what's up?

40:43.179 --> 40:44.442
I'm in.

40:44.485 --> 40:46.792
What does Rose need me to do?

40:48.141 --> 40:49.229
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, boy.

40:49.272 --> 40:50.970
I don't want to focus on that.
