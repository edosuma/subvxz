WEBVTT

01:35.763 --> 01:36.764
Begin.

01:37.515 --> 01:42.353
The capitol bombing was carried out
with great success.

01:42.853 --> 01:47.149
Fifty-two casualties.
Mostly high-ranking government officials.

01:48.818 --> 01:49.652
More.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.445
Um...

01:53.239 --> 01:57.743
The prime minister of Costa Verde
has refused our request to meet.

01:58.744 --> 02:01.163
I have exhausted all options.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.346
What about the girl?

02:28.816 --> 02:32.152
Her real name is Yuki Mifune.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.447
She's working for the United States...

02:36.615 --> 02:40.160
under a code name, Lady Death.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.914
Do we know where she is?

02:45.916 --> 02:46.750
Not yet.

02:53.215 --> 02:54.216
Find her.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.428
At any cost!

03:02.725 --> 03:04.018
At any cost.

03:34.256 --> 03:36.800
Yeah, it's a bummer.
I was looking forward to that game.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.471
But duty calls,
so I gave the tickets to my ex-wife.

03:40.471 --> 03:41.388
Hm.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.308
Sidney mentioned how excited he was to go.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.101
That's big of you.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.103
What do you mean?

03:48.896 --> 03:52.316
Not everyone's on such good terms
with their ex-wife's new husband.

03:52.816 --> 03:55.611
No, no. Not that. I mean,
what do you mean, "Sidney mentioned"?

03:57.029 --> 03:59.698
Last time we were on the phone.
He said how pumped he was.

04:00.199 --> 04:01.617
He invited me, actually.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.747
You were on the phone?

04:06.747 --> 04:12.211
When were you on the phone
with my ex-wife's new husband?

04:14.046 --> 04:19.510
Well, it wasn't just him. Shelly too.
We were Zooming and she popped in and...

04:21.553 --> 04:24.515
Don't worry. I told them I couldn't go,
if that's what you're thinking.

04:25.182 --> 04:28.310
- No. No, that's not what I'm thinking.
- Okay. Good.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.980
What I'm thinking is, you were Skyping
with my ex-wife's husband.

04:30.980 --> 04:32.982
- Zooming.
- Zooming. Right. My bad.

04:32.982 --> 04:35.025
Why the hell were you Zooming?

04:35.025 --> 04:36.485
This time? Uh...

04:36.485 --> 04:39.321
This time? There've been other times?

04:39.321 --> 04:43.867
I mean, yeah. Every now and then,
when it's too hard to meet up in person.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.744
Okay.

04:45.744 --> 04:49.206
Just you, Shelly, and Sidney.
That's lovely.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.710
It is. Really is.

04:54.837 --> 04:56.547
Oh, no, by all means, continue.

04:57.923 --> 04:59.466
Gentlemen, I've got good news.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.678
Lady Death is alive.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.431
I didn't know
we thought she was dead, sir.

05:05.431 --> 05:06.932
Is she okay?

05:06.932 --> 05:09.768
For the past six months,
while you two were in Colombia,

05:10.477 --> 05:13.605
I sent her on a mission
to terminate Ivan Bubalo.

05:15.024 --> 05:16.025
The cult leader?

05:16.025 --> 05:19.111
Oh, no, no.
He's much more than a cult leader.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.488
They call him Bubalo the Conqueror.

05:21.488 --> 05:25.534
<i>His regime is quickly gaining
the political and territorial foothold</i>

05:25.534 --> 05:27.619
<i>to cause serious unrest in the region.</i>

05:27.619 --> 05:31.290
<i>Where he was once at war
with the legitimate government of Malta,</i>

05:31.290 --> 05:36.503
<i>he and his cronies have now managed to put
an entirely new administration in place,</i>

05:36.503 --> 05:38.964
<i>one with which he works hand-in-hand.</i>

05:38.964 --> 05:43.719
<i>His cult, or terrorist cell,
call themselves the State of Aragon.</i>

05:43.719 --> 05:49.016
<i>And unlike al Qaeda and Hezbollah,
their allegiance is not to God or Allah.</i>

05:49.016 --> 05:50.476
<i>It is to Bubalo.</i>

05:50.476 --> 05:53.270
- This is good for us.

05:53.270 --> 05:56.732
I feel if we can cut off the head,
we can kill the snake,

05:56.732 --> 05:59.902
and the State of Aragon
will come to a swift end.

05:59.902 --> 06:02.863
The head will need to be not only Bubalo's

06:02.863 --> 06:04.573
<i>but its top-ranking officials.</i>

06:05.074 --> 06:06.075
<i>Five in total.</i>

06:06.075 --> 06:08.285
And you sent LD to do just that,
I take it?

06:08.285 --> 06:09.828
Six months ago.

06:09.828 --> 06:12.998
After she infiltrated the base,
I lost contact.

06:12.998 --> 06:15.959
I haven't heard from her since. Until now.

06:15.959 --> 06:20.839
She sent an SOS signal from a phone
that we traced back to Bubalo's palace.

06:21.465 --> 06:24.218
Gentlemen,
your mission is to extract Lady D...

06:24.968 --> 06:26.512
and finish what she started.

06:26.512 --> 06:29.556
Find LD and cut off
the head of the snake. Copy.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.058
All six snakes.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.936
The CIA can't officially be involved.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.605
That's where we come in.

06:36.605 --> 06:39.066
Okay. Let's get to work.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.520
And now.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.484
- There you go, buddy. Sweet dreams.

07:23.944 --> 07:24.778
Okay.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.084
Hello, Ana.

09:02.084 --> 09:06.296
Ana Costa. The State of Aragon's
minister of propaganda.

09:06.296 --> 09:09.591
<i>She keeps the followers in check,
with fear and intimidation,</i>

09:09.591 --> 09:13.428
so Bubalo can keep the appearance
of benevolent savior.

09:14.471 --> 09:17.307
Sounds great. Consider her dead, sir.

09:17.307 --> 09:21.353
Moving on, don't we have
some sort of "No shirt, no shoes" policy?

09:27.526 --> 09:31.029
Oh, Ana, you couldn't
just make this easy for me.

09:31.655 --> 09:35.450
Come on, buddy.
Why don't you go take a walk?

09:35.450 --> 09:37.536
<i>B, I'm in the upstairs bathroom.</i>

09:38.120 --> 09:40.247
<i>Seems like
you'd have a perfect shot up here.</i>

09:40.247 --> 09:42.791
Ah. Good to know. Thanks.

09:46.628 --> 09:49.923
I'm gonna take these curtains down
so you have this shot all day.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.217
<i>Good thinking. How are you gonna--?</i>

09:54.511 --> 09:57.055
Oops. Someone needs to make a Target run.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.057
Hope they have green.

10:31.423 --> 10:33.008
I've got eyes on Mario 1.

10:34.384 --> 10:37.721
Mario Fava, Bubalo's head of security.

10:38.347 --> 10:40.515
Perhaps the most ruthless
of the entire bunch.

10:40.515 --> 10:43.435
<i>He delights
in turning the faithful followers</i>

10:43.435 --> 10:45.228
<i>into mindless war machines</i>

10:45.228 --> 10:49.107
<i>and uses routine death matches
to separate the weak from the strong.</i>

10:50.776 --> 10:54.029
Katrina wants to see you on the terrace.

10:54.029 --> 10:55.197
It's private.

10:57.199 --> 10:58.367
Miss Costa?

10:59.451 --> 11:00.786
It's private.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.419
You hear that?
I'm sending Mario 1 up to the terrace.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.880
<i>Yeah, I heard that. You speak Maltese?</i>

11:11.880 --> 11:13.924
No. No, just that one phrase.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.885
Gotta be prepared, B. Do your research.

11:17.969 --> 11:18.970
Old-fashioned.

11:25.685 --> 11:30.899
Katrina Costa. Sister of Ana Costa
and Bubalo's personal accountant.

11:31.483 --> 11:34.820
<i>The person in charge
of Bubalo's astronomical wealth.</i>

11:34.820 --> 11:38.990
<i>She's forced much of the Maltese
working poor into abject poverty.</i>

11:40.367 --> 11:45.372
At which point, allegiance to
the State of Aragon is their only way out.

11:46.748 --> 11:49.918
Mario Fava wants to see you
on the terrace.

11:53.004 --> 11:54.089
It's private.

11:56.842 --> 11:57.676
Excuse me.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.263
<i>Katrina Costa is
en route to join Mario 1 on the terrace.</i>

12:01.263 --> 12:03.723
<i>Should be a BOGO for you. How you doing?</i>

12:03.723 --> 12:05.517
Still waiting on the sister.

12:06.184 --> 12:09.062
She's a sitting duck, but she's got
a bodyguard that ain't budging.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.857
<i>Good luck with that.
I'm gonna keep hunting for Lady Death.</i>

12:21.992 --> 12:22.993
Oh, shit.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.746
Mario Muscat, aka Mario 2,

12:26.746 --> 12:29.458
on account of there being
another high-ranking Mario.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.501
<i>Bubalo's attorney.</i>

12:31.501 --> 12:35.005
<i>His back-channel influence
and bullish political sway</i>

12:35.005 --> 12:37.424
have made Bubalo untouchable.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.094
-  Done.
-  Done.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.108
Aw, man. Just like Elvis.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.943
So long, asshole.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.828
Zero, I need cleanup on Aisle 5.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.581
Yeah, I don't know
what the hell that means.

13:09.581 --> 13:13.043
- I just shot Mario 2 on the toilet.
- The window thing worked?

13:13.043 --> 13:15.837
Someone will need to use the bathroom.
We're gonna be blown.

13:15.837 --> 13:18.089
Yeah. Don't worry about it.
It's right around the corner.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.758
I'll take care-- Oh, shit.

13:19.758 --> 13:22.093
<i>- What?</i>
- Nothing.

13:24.846 --> 13:28.099
Bubalo wants to see you on the terrace.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.227
It's private.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.646
What is this?

13:32.646 --> 13:34.189
I need to use the bathroom.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.816
Bubalo...

13:36.816 --> 13:39.194
Bubalo wants to see you on the terrace.

13:39.694 --> 13:40.946
It's private.

13:40.946 --> 13:43.740
Why would Bubalo want to see me?
Who are you?

13:43.740 --> 13:44.699
Hm.

13:45.534 --> 13:48.411
Bubalo wants to see you on the terrace.

13:51.873 --> 13:54.376
Okay. Then I must go...

13:55.460 --> 13:56.711
if the master calls.

14:00.757 --> 14:01.967
How do I look?

14:05.011 --> 14:06.096
It's private.

14:14.229 --> 14:16.940
You couldn't have shot
the 110-pound woman on the toilet?

14:25.323 --> 14:26.700
There you go, bucko.

14:52.434 --> 14:53.476
Ah.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.064
Mario 1.

14:58.940 --> 15:02.110
From what I hear, Katrina Costa wants
to see you on the terrace.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.613
So where the hell is she?

15:06.239 --> 15:07.073
Ah.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.867
There you are.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.703
So who's first?

15:12.203 --> 15:13.246
So...

15:13.246 --> 15:15.582
So, what? You asked to see me?

15:17.500 --> 15:20.879
- I was told you wanted to see me.
- No. There must be some misunderstanding.

15:24.674 --> 15:27.636
Well, while we're alone... there is
something I need to talk to you about.

15:29.179 --> 15:30.221
It's private--

15:36.686 --> 15:37.687
How about both?

15:47.447 --> 15:49.574
-  Zoran Zoric.

15:49.574 --> 15:50.909
Bubalo's doctor.

15:50.909 --> 15:53.870
In addition to-- Oh, the hell with it.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.580
<i>Read your dossier.</i>

15:55.580 --> 15:58.667
He's bad. Take him out. Go!

16:28.780 --> 16:29.781
Who are you?

16:30.323 --> 16:33.243
The piper.
And your balance is long overdue.

16:38.123 --> 16:39.499
He saved my life.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.000
He's a friend.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.670
We gotta get you out of here.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.088
He's coming with us.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.299
Okay, doc. Lead the way.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.930
I have LD and the doctor.
It's a long story.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.349
Your radio's on. I heard everything.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.810
<i>Even that part
about his balance being overdue.</i>

16:58.810 --> 16:59.936
Okay. Shut up.

16:59.936 --> 17:02.188
<i>Three down, two to go.
Let's finish and get out of here.</i>

17:02.188 --> 17:03.231
Working on it.

17:11.614 --> 17:14.075
Oh, what's that? Better go investigate.

17:31.843 --> 17:32.844
Dr. Zoric.

17:35.430 --> 17:38.391
-  Is this not...?
-  These are two new recruits.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.518
Happy day.

17:41.186 --> 17:43.813
This is the traitor.
She tried to kill Bubalo.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.815
No! You have her confused.

17:49.944 --> 17:52.864
He wasn't on the hit list,
but he didn't seem like a very good guy.

17:53.865 --> 17:57.994
B, we've been made!
You need to take care of Bubalo now.

18:55.593 --> 18:58.680
I have him.
But he's completely surrounded.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.641
- Do you have an exit strategy?
-  <i>Working on it. Take him out.</i>

19:01.641 --> 19:03.268
<i>Is Yuki safe?</i>

19:10.024 --> 19:12.652
Yeah, she's fine. Get Bubalo. Let's go.

19:22.912 --> 19:27.000
May God bless the State of Aragon!

19:32.839 --> 19:36.175
Today and forever.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.779
We're out of here, B.
We'll meet you at the rendezvous point.

19:59.657 --> 20:03.286
I'd say that went pretty well,
all things considered.

20:23.014 --> 20:27.310
<i>Dr. Zoric, we owe you a debt of gratitude.
Thank you.</i>

20:27.977 --> 20:28.978
<i>Is that Beckett?</i>

20:29.479 --> 20:30.396
 Evening, sir.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.441
<i>Congratulations
on a very successful mission.</i>

20:33.441 --> 20:36.819
- I'm just happy to see Yuki alive.
<i>- Yeah, aren't we all?</i>

20:37.820 --> 20:40.406
<i>A chopper will be there bright and early
to lift you out.</i>

20:40.907 --> 20:44.869
<i>For now, batten down the hatches.
Get some rest.</i>

20:46.955 --> 20:51.584
Dr. Zoric, this is Brandon.
Brandon, you're familiar.

20:53.044 --> 20:54.170
I am.

20:57.882 --> 20:59.717
I owe this man my life.

21:00.343 --> 21:04.430
<i>It took three months for them to trust me
and truly accept me.</i>

21:04.430 --> 21:07.850
<i>But once they did,
I quickly became a favorite.</i>

21:08.893 --> 21:11.646
<i>Bubalo would personally request
her presence.</i>

21:11.646 --> 21:13.314
<i>He always took a special liking</i>

21:13.314 --> 21:17.360
<i>to those that made him feel as though
his influence stretched across the globe.</i>

21:17.986 --> 21:19.570
<i>I was with him regularly,</i>

21:19.570 --> 21:22.240
<i>playing along, waiting for the moment
when I could strike.</i>

21:22.240 --> 21:24.742
<i>But Bubalo is never alone.</i>

21:25.868 --> 21:28.871
-  <i>Well, almost never.</i>

21:37.714 --> 21:39.549
<i>I finally got my chance, but...</i>

21:39.549 --> 21:41.426
<i>Ana Costa.</i>

21:41.426 --> 21:45.555
<i>The only person we all feared
more than Bubalo himself.</i>

21:53.479 --> 21:55.940
<i>I was shot four times in the back</i>

21:55.940 --> 21:57.942
<i>and barely managed to escape.</i>

22:02.530 --> 22:05.783
<i>By sheer luck, I found her, unconscious.</i>

22:06.784 --> 22:10.538
<i>Had I been even one minute later,
she would have certainly died.</i>

22:11.039 --> 22:14.542
<i>If not from her wounds,
then from a patrolling guard.</i>

22:15.918 --> 22:18.212
He risked his own life to save mine.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.175
We're very grateful.

22:23.259 --> 22:24.093
Thank you.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.472
We've all had a long day.

22:27.472 --> 22:30.475
Let's get some shut-eye.
Be ready for the chopper in the morning.

22:30.475 --> 22:31.726
I call floor!

22:53.790 --> 22:54.624
Hey.

22:55.833 --> 22:56.834
Jeep's gone.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.977
- Doctor.
- No. Please, please, please.

24:03.985 --> 24:05.278
Shit.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.038
Whoa.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.168
It's password-protected, asshole.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.594
Okay. Not bad.

25:24.315 --> 25:25.483
Go for Reggie.

25:25.483 --> 25:27.610
Hey, Reggie. Zeke Rosenberg.

25:27.610 --> 25:29.654
Listen, I need you
to ping a laptop for me.

25:29.654 --> 25:33.074
Look, I'm afraid
without consent from the laptop's owner,

25:33.074 --> 25:37.161
I'm not at liberty to... what have you.

25:37.161 --> 25:39.997
What the hell are you talking about?
Patriot Act.

25:39.997 --> 25:43.292
<i>Of course.
But I would still need a proper warrant.</i>

25:43.292 --> 25:45.253
<i>I assume it's sensitive.</i>

25:45.836 --> 25:49.257
I won't pry.
Can you obtain the documentation for me?

25:49.257 --> 25:52.593
Just do it, and I promise
I won't even mention your name. Okay?

25:52.593 --> 25:54.387
I don't even know you. What's your name?

25:54.387 --> 25:55.763
Reggie.

25:55.763 --> 25:58.808
No, I know.
I just-- I mean, like, who are you?

25:58.808 --> 26:00.393
What's the meaning of this call?

26:01.018 --> 26:05.940
You called me.
You wanted me to ping a laptop.

26:05.940 --> 26:08.693
Reggie. Can you help me or not?

26:11.028 --> 26:14.031
- No. Apologies.
- Yeah.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.118
Oh...

26:35.594 --> 26:37.805
- Hello.
- Intelligence Pete.

26:37.805 --> 26:38.848
Zero.

26:38.848 --> 26:42.518
Hey. Listen, I need a favor, buddy.

26:43.227 --> 26:46.480
What do you need? Wait, are you moving?

26:46.480 --> 26:49.483
No. Listen, it's probably impossible.

26:49.483 --> 26:52.820
G.R.I.T.'s techie couldn't do it,
so I figured I'd just call just in case.

26:52.820 --> 26:55.823
Oh, G.R.I.T.'s techie couldn't do it?
Come on, Zero. What is it?

26:55.823 --> 26:57.325
If I give you an address,

26:57.325 --> 26:59.702
<i>could you ping a laptop within,
say, the nearest--?</i>

26:59.702 --> 27:04.373
I got three laptops and a dozen or so
cell phones in your immediate vicinity.

27:04.373 --> 27:07.168
- Do you want me to go out further?
- I didn't even give you an address.

27:07.168 --> 27:09.879
You're talking to me on a GPS device.

27:10.671 --> 27:16.969
Okay, hotshot. The three laptops.
There's one in a café across from me.

27:19.388 --> 27:20.473
There's two.

27:20.473 --> 27:24.310
<i>- Okay. What's on the first one?</i>
- The Bed Bath & Beyond website.

27:24.310 --> 27:27.355
Looks like they're in the market
for an air fryer. Oh, and towels.

27:27.355 --> 27:29.315
The air fryer's in the cart.
But the towels--

27:29.315 --> 27:31.776
Yeah, that's good. Good.
Great. And the second one?

27:31.776 --> 27:35.863
Okay. Um, you know, I don't really
feel comfortable with this, Zero.

27:36.530 --> 27:40.368
IP. Come on. I need you to tell me, buddy.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.329
Listen. It isn't always easy
saving the world. Okay?

27:43.329 --> 27:46.082
Yeah, it's just, I don't think
you're gonna want to hear this.

27:46.082 --> 27:47.166
IP.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.251
Okay, if you insist.

27:49.835 --> 27:53.506
She is holding a banana, Zero,
and not with her hands,

27:53.506 --> 27:55.633
and he is peeling it.

27:55.633 --> 27:58.219
Okay, okay. Okay. No, no, no.

28:01.722 --> 28:05.643
Okay, so we have Bed Bath & Beyond
and banana. That's it?

28:05.643 --> 28:07.853
No, you know what? There's three.

28:07.853 --> 28:10.231
<i>Okay, this one's interesting, Zero.</i>

28:10.231 --> 28:14.110
He's on the dark web.
Guy does not appear to be an amateur.

28:14.110 --> 28:17.571
What is he doing? Give me everything.
Can you mirror it to my phone?

28:18.155 --> 28:20.449
Maybe. Give me a minute.

28:21.367 --> 28:25.996
Okay, he's chatting with someone
calling themselves Prince Caspian.

28:25.996 --> 28:28.374
They're coordinating an exchange...

28:28.874 --> 28:29.708
Whoa.

28:30.251 --> 28:31.836
<i>Prince Caspian is paying 5.2 million</i>

28:31.836 --> 28:35.214
<i>for something code-named
the Maltese Falcon.</i>

28:35.214 --> 28:36.215
Like the movie?

28:36.215 --> 28:39.927
Or the book, but, yes, sure,
the movie, if that helps you.

28:39.927 --> 28:43.681
Uh-- Oh, hang on. Looks like
it's going down in a couple hours.

28:43.681 --> 28:45.766
I have coordinates.
I can send them to you.

28:45.766 --> 28:48.853
Intelligence Pete, you've done it again,
my friend. Thank you.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.856
Prince Caspian has exited the vehicle.

29:33.856 --> 29:35.441
He's got a bodyguard with him.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.849
All right, guys, I can't see shit.

30:08.849 --> 30:11.477
Give me a heads-up when they're done
and I'll follow Caspian.

30:11.477 --> 30:13.187
<i>- Copy?</i>
- Copy.

30:16.398 --> 30:17.399
LD?

30:20.486 --> 30:21.779
Yuki, you copy?

30:24.949 --> 30:26.283
<i>B, you got eyes on Yuki?</i>

30:28.285 --> 30:29.453
I do not.

30:29.453 --> 30:30.621
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

30:30.621 --> 30:33.541
Yes, Zero. Lady Death has gone rogue.

30:33.541 --> 30:34.875
Shocker.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.879
- The Maltese Falcon?
- Right here.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.884
- The code?
- The diamonds?

31:05.656 --> 31:07.658
Two, seven, two, seven.

31:13.539 --> 31:16.000
What's the problem?
I can show you how to use it.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.835
What is this bullshit?

31:20.004 --> 31:22.840
It was working perfectly
the last time I checked. What's wrong?

31:23.882 --> 31:25.217
Wave if you're okay.

31:30.306 --> 31:33.684
Either this thing's broken
or she's in my car.

31:33.684 --> 31:37.479
And according to my driver,
that's not the case, so--

31:49.992 --> 31:51.285
Zero, we have a problem.

31:51.285 --> 31:53.746
Prince Caspian jumped in his car
and he's headed your way.

31:53.746 --> 31:56.665
Aw, shit! What happened to my heads-up?

31:56.665 --> 31:59.335
Lady Death happened.
I told you not to park so far away.

31:59.335 --> 32:02.421
B, we've been over this.
He knows what our car looks like!

32:02.421 --> 32:03.589
I'm heading down.

32:29.239 --> 32:31.825
How do you know him?
What's your business with him?

32:31.825 --> 32:33.160
LD, he's dying.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.496
- Answer me!
- He's bleeding out. He won't make it.

32:35.496 --> 32:37.498
Tell me what you were selling to him!

32:37.498 --> 32:38.624
Back up. Back up.

32:38.624 --> 32:42.211
- Who are you? Who are you?
- He's dead!

32:42.711 --> 32:43.921
How do you know him?

32:43.921 --> 32:46.465
- Yuki. Yuki! He's dead.
- Tell me!

32:47.091 --> 32:49.218
- What happened?
- Tell me!

32:52.638 --> 32:53.472
Yuki?

33:32.469 --> 33:34.888
That man was Soshi Mifune.

33:37.975 --> 33:39.059
My father.

33:39.727 --> 33:44.648
<i>My birth parents died
when I was 5 years old, and he adopted me.</i>

33:44.648 --> 33:49.862
<i>He loved me and cared for me
until my 10th birthday.</i>

33:50.529 --> 33:52.781
<i>On that day, everything changed.</i>

33:55.701 --> 33:59.204
<i>He blindfolded me
and told me he had a surprise.</i>

33:59.913 --> 34:01.874
<i>I thought I was getting a pony.</i>

34:10.257 --> 34:11.550
<i>I don't know where he took me,</i>

34:11.550 --> 34:14.720
<i>but he kept me locked inside
for six weeks,</i>

34:15.345 --> 34:18.098
<i>with only enough rice and water
to keep me alive.</i>

34:30.944 --> 34:34.531
<i>He broke me
and rebuilt me into an assassin.</i>

34:37.367 --> 34:40.788
<i>When I was 15,
I was ready for my first assignment.</i>

34:40.788 --> 34:44.041
<i>A cook who had stolen money
from my father.</i>

34:47.586 --> 34:48.712
<i>Supposedly.</i>

34:53.467 --> 34:56.720
<i>By 21, I was his most trusted assassin.</i>

35:07.064 --> 35:09.441
<i>Until my 25th birthday...</i>

35:10.067 --> 35:12.778
<i>when I killed him and escaped.</i>

35:12.778 --> 35:14.863
Sayonara, Papa.

35:23.664 --> 35:25.207
At least, I thought I did.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.154
Before you start spouting lies,

35:56.780 --> 36:02.244
let me say that we have security footage
of you doing business with Dr. Zoric.

36:03.745 --> 36:06.582
You have one chance to tell us

36:06.582 --> 36:11.920
where to find that treacherous
little bitch, Lady Death,

36:12.838 --> 36:15.841
or you'll be as dead
as that man on the floor behind you.

36:20.846 --> 36:23.724
I appreciate
how it looks from your cameras...

36:24.641 --> 36:28.604
but you've misunderstood
my dealings with your Dr. Zoric.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.567
You see, we have a common enemy.

36:34.651 --> 36:36.570
I want her as dead as you do.

36:36.570 --> 36:38.322
I don't know about that.

36:39.072 --> 36:43.327
Well, on this,
you'll just have to take my word.

36:45.495 --> 36:47.164
And thanks to the good doctor...

36:58.592 --> 37:00.802
I'm in possession of a tracking device

37:00.802 --> 37:03.388
that will tell us
exactly where to find her.

37:05.307 --> 37:08.769
So I suggest,
rather than get in each other's way,

37:09.353 --> 37:11.104
we pool our resources.

37:13.023 --> 37:16.068
I know the password. And you have an army.

37:17.486 --> 37:18.904
We want the same thing.

37:25.869 --> 37:26.954
Mister...?

37:28.080 --> 37:29.081
Mifune.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.251
Mr. Mifune.

37:34.503 --> 37:35.963
You have 48 hours.

37:38.632 --> 37:39.466
Go.

37:40.217 --> 37:43.387
- Our resources are at your disposal.
- Fantastic.

37:46.390 --> 37:47.683
Let's start with him.

38:46.742 --> 38:48.994
Ugh.
That was the worst meal I've ever had.

38:53.206 --> 38:54.666
Intel Pete's calling.

38:55.542 --> 38:56.376
Answer it.

40:06.113 --> 40:07.489
Who the hell was that?

40:20.252 --> 40:22.963
Six missed calls from Intelligence Pete.

40:22.963 --> 40:24.548
- Better see what he wants.
- Yeah.

40:32.013 --> 40:32.848
It's about time.

40:32.848 --> 40:35.517
Hey. You're on speaker
with Brandon and LD.

40:35.517 --> 40:39.312
Good. Listen, I kept digging
into the Prince Caspian thing.

40:39.312 --> 40:41.940
I figured out what the Maltese Falcon is.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.442
LD, there's a tracking device on you.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.445
<i>That asshole auctioned off your location
to the highest bidder.</i>

40:47.445 --> 40:49.990
Prince Caspian won, whoever that is.

40:50.574 --> 40:51.616
Thanks, IP.

40:52.409 --> 40:54.661
Zoric gave you a phone
to call the Colonel, right?

40:55.162 --> 40:58.123
- Did he let you keep it?
- Did he insist that you keep it?

41:11.469 --> 41:13.930
We spent the night
in the same room with this guy.

41:13.930 --> 41:17.017
We can't be too safe.
We should get rid of all our phones.

41:17.017 --> 41:18.101
Yeah.

41:25.358 --> 41:29.279
Okay, all right.
Both of you. On three, ready?

41:29.279 --> 41:31.990
One, two, three.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.952
- I think Yuki got that one.
- It was me.

41:36.536 --> 41:37.537
That was me.

41:37.537 --> 41:41.124
Yeah. Fine.
Listen, we can't stop with our phones.

41:41.124 --> 41:43.501
He had access to our cars,
clothes, computers.

41:43.501 --> 41:47.839
- He could have tagged anything.
- You're right. So we destroy everything.

41:50.759 --> 41:52.969
Probably should have told the colonel
we were going AWOL

41:52.969 --> 41:54.638
before we destroyed our phones.

42:14.282 --> 42:15.116
Hello.

42:16.034 --> 42:17.410
About time. Wow.

42:17.410 --> 42:19.996
I'd like the grilled cheese
and tomato soup.

42:19.996 --> 42:21.790
No pickles, please.

42:21.790 --> 42:22.999
Oh.

42:22.999 --> 42:25.085
And what kind of orange pop do you have?

42:25.085 --> 42:29.589
Orange pop? You're in a brewery.
You're not gonna order a beer?

42:29.589 --> 42:32.259
No. And again, no pickles. Please.

42:32.259 --> 42:36.137
It's very important that no pickle juice
comes into contact with my crust. Okay?

42:36.137 --> 42:37.097
Thanks.

42:37.097 --> 42:39.391
I've lost contact with my team.

42:39.891 --> 42:41.643
We last spoke when they were on their way

42:41.643 --> 42:43.979
to intercept something
called the Maltese Falcon

42:43.979 --> 42:46.481
from someone called Prince Caspian,

42:46.481 --> 42:49.651
on the advice
of someone called Intelligence Pete.

42:50.360 --> 42:53.905
Now I need help finding them,
assuming they're still alive.

42:55.240 --> 42:56.449
Let's get a table.

42:56.449 --> 42:59.703
I actually prefer the bar.
I just like to be higher up--

42:59.703 --> 43:01.830
Okay. A table's fine.

43:02.956 --> 43:05.750
- They've gone dark?
- Completely off the grid.

43:05.750 --> 43:08.336
- That's good. Smart thinking.
- What now?

43:10.505 --> 43:14.467
The Maltese Falcon is a tracking number.
Yuki's been bugged.

43:14.968 --> 43:17.429
Someone wanted to find her. Very badly.

43:17.429 --> 43:18.513
Shit.

43:20.932 --> 43:22.475
Cameras.

43:22.475 --> 43:23.935
<i>The coordinates you gave them</i>

43:23.935 --> 43:27.647
<i>led them to an abandoned fortress,
recently acquired by Ivan Bubalo.</i>

43:27.647 --> 43:30.066
<i>All of his properties are equipped
with cameras.</i>

43:30.066 --> 43:32.068
But the footage is on a local network.

43:32.569 --> 43:35.488
I can take us there,
if you can get us past the firewall.

43:36.323 --> 43:39.367
I'm sure I can. But where are we going?

43:39.951 --> 43:40.785
Malta.

43:41.661 --> 43:44.706
Right. Yeah. Okay, I'm in.

43:44.706 --> 43:47.375
I'll just need to swing home
to get my keyboard and mouse.

43:50.462 --> 43:53.840
- I can probably use whatever you have.
- Good.

43:55.342 --> 43:56.593
Intelligence Pete...

43:57.844 --> 43:59.054
call your mom.

44:00.347 --> 44:01.473
Tell her you love her.

44:02.015 --> 44:04.351
Because if I find out
you've set my team up,

44:05.226 --> 44:06.478
you won't be coming home.

44:09.064 --> 44:10.523
Grilled cheese. No pickle.

44:10.523 --> 44:13.818
It's important that no pickle juice
come in contact with his crust.

44:16.613 --> 44:18.490
And an orange pop, please.

44:22.827 --> 44:24.079
Okay, we should split up.

44:24.079 --> 44:27.040
You get the guns.
You get the clothes. I'll get the car.

44:28.333 --> 44:31.461
Kind of sexist to assume
that LD wants to get the clothes.

44:31.461 --> 44:33.088
No, no, no. That's not what I meant.

44:33.088 --> 44:35.465
I just didn't want to tell anyone else
to steal the car.

44:35.465 --> 44:38.676
Could have told me to
get the guns and him to get the clothes.

44:38.676 --> 44:39.594
Fine.

44:39.594 --> 44:41.221
However you want to do it.

44:41.221 --> 44:43.556
Hey, someone doesn't speak Japanese, so...

44:43.556 --> 44:45.850
Car, guns, clothes.

44:50.897 --> 44:54.359
I'd like a slim-fit bootcut.
Uh, waist, 31.

44:54.359 --> 44:55.610
Fuck off!

45:11.376 --> 45:12.961
Do you have this in a medium?

45:12.961 --> 45:14.462
What's your poison?

45:15.630 --> 45:17.382
- Barrett M82.

45:18.133 --> 45:21.052
Kid's toy.
I got something better. How about this?

45:22.512 --> 45:25.306
That's the kid's toy.
Just give me the Remington there.

45:25.306 --> 45:28.143
Well, your loss.
Okay, Remington it is. Scope?

45:28.143 --> 45:29.811
Schmidt & Bender. Day.

45:30.478 --> 45:31.771
Marine, huh?

45:31.771 --> 45:35.066
Fresh out of those,
but I got this Russian puppy.

45:36.276 --> 45:38.695
- I'll take that one.
- Nah, that's a hunting scope.

45:39.279 --> 45:41.614
Yeah, well, I grew up hunting, so...

45:42.365 --> 45:44.868
Okay, whatever.
Um, anything else you need?

45:44.868 --> 45:47.078
Uh, DOPE book, rangefinder?

45:47.829 --> 45:51.166
Take these three Berettas.
Uh, gonna need a couple of knives.

45:51.833 --> 45:53.501
- That an Uzi?
- Yeah.

45:53.501 --> 45:55.128
What else you got in here?

46:00.800 --> 46:01.634
Wait.

46:02.719 --> 46:03.720
One more thing.

46:11.478 --> 46:14.731
- Well, you got clothes in there for me?
- Oh, I sure do.

46:21.279 --> 46:23.948
- Really?
- Yeah. That's all they had in your size.

46:24.782 --> 46:28.870
So you're telling me that in all of Malta,
they didn't have one size-large T-shirt?

46:28.870 --> 46:31.164
Yes. Very limited selections here.

46:31.789 --> 46:34.876
- Man, you're a real piece of--
- Guys!

46:34.876 --> 46:36.586
I think we should get going.

46:37.337 --> 46:38.338
I agree.

46:38.338 --> 46:40.507
I don't speak Japanese!

46:40.507 --> 46:41.799
Let's go!

46:42.258 --> 46:43.760
Now, was that so hard?

46:48.765 --> 46:49.766
Hey, B.

46:55.146 --> 46:56.356
You got me aviators?

47:00.777 --> 47:02.362
I got you an Uzi.

47:03.196 --> 47:04.364
Thanks, man.

47:35.603 --> 47:37.313
Sorry we're not flying private.

47:38.147 --> 47:40.024
G.R.I.T. is very black ops...

47:43.111 --> 47:45.154
which has its advantages.

47:45.154 --> 47:48.116
Unfortunately, it prohibits me
from using our better toys,

47:48.825 --> 47:50.451
especially on such short notice.

47:51.411 --> 47:52.537
Nah, it's cool.

47:54.581 --> 47:56.749
I've never flown anything but commercial.

47:56.749 --> 47:59.544
I mean, usually first class, but...

48:01.379 --> 48:02.505
coach is fine.

48:02.505 --> 48:04.924
- Again, the short notice.
- Yeah, no...

48:06.009 --> 48:08.052
Um, maybe just...

48:08.052 --> 48:10.346
Maybe just take
your assigned window seat.

48:10.346 --> 48:12.181
You know, give us a little buffer.

48:12.181 --> 48:13.933
I assumed we'd make an offer

48:13.933 --> 48:17.061
to trade whoever has the middle seat
so we can talk.

48:17.061 --> 48:18.146
But if you prefer...

48:20.106 --> 48:20.940
Yeah.

48:26.237 --> 48:29.157
- What can I get you?
- Scotch on the rocks, please.

48:30.742 --> 48:31.743
Nothing for him.

48:31.743 --> 48:34.871
I'll take a Sunkist or Fanta,
whatever you have.

48:42.337 --> 48:44.005
Big choice for an airline.

48:45.340 --> 48:48.176
- Is this gonna be a problem?
- It might be.

49:07.070 --> 49:07.904
My God.

49:09.530 --> 49:11.574
- Good, bad?
- It's...

49:13.159 --> 49:14.827
How have I not known about this?

49:16.621 --> 49:17.789
It's perfect.

49:18.539 --> 49:20.667
Here. Try it.

49:20.667 --> 49:21.793
No, I'm okay.

49:22.502 --> 49:25.046
You don't understand. You need to try it.

49:25.755 --> 49:27.507
I don't think it goes well with Scotch.

49:27.507 --> 49:30.593
It goes well with anything. Try it.

49:43.981 --> 49:45.983
Okay. Fine. Have it your way.

49:50.947 --> 49:53.449
Hey, what--? Whoa. That's not cool.

49:54.033 --> 49:56.369
He's gonna have to report that.
Stranger touched his belongings.

49:57.161 --> 49:59.997
Our mission is in here.
I need you to get it out.

50:00.832 --> 50:04.419
- In the--? Wait, this guy's with us?
- Take the laptop.

50:13.594 --> 50:15.596
- Do you have the password?
- Nope.

50:16.180 --> 50:17.014
I see.

50:17.849 --> 50:18.850
Okay.

50:25.898 --> 50:29.485
- All right, what am I looking for?
- Find it and tell me.

50:30.653 --> 50:31.654
All right.

50:32.780 --> 50:33.698
Um...

50:33.698 --> 50:37.452
Photos of him with his family, his dog.

50:37.452 --> 50:40.288
Okay, here's last year's taxes,
bank statements,

50:40.288 --> 50:42.707
his Social Security number.
Is there something specific?

50:44.542 --> 50:47.170
Hey. Hey, that's my laptop, asshole.

50:47.879 --> 50:50.590
These are my bank statements.
What the hell are you doing?

50:50.590 --> 50:53.509
- Ma'am! Ma'am!
- Sorry, what's the problem?

50:53.509 --> 50:56.971
Uh, yeah, this guy stole my laptop
while I was sleeping!

50:56.971 --> 51:01.058
It's all fine. I'm in the CIA.
Do you have any more of this Crash?

51:01.058 --> 51:02.769
-  Right?!

51:18.826 --> 51:19.827
Anything?

51:21.329 --> 51:22.330
Nope.

51:23.581 --> 51:26.459
We've been on this impromptu stakeout
for nine hours.

51:27.126 --> 51:29.086
I think it's safe to say
that we destroyed that bug

51:29.086 --> 51:30.713
when LD blasted her phone.

51:32.340 --> 51:35.051
Yeah. You're probably right.

51:35.051 --> 51:37.595
It's just that everything
we brought to Malta is in that truck.

51:37.595 --> 51:40.431
If it wasn't the phone,
then the doctor's tracker's down there.

51:41.140 --> 51:43.643
We just give it one more hour,
see if he takes the bait.

51:45.812 --> 51:48.147
You're not the one stuck out here
on your stomach.

51:48.147 --> 51:49.357
Isn't that what you do?

51:53.236 --> 51:54.237
One more hour.

52:14.048 --> 52:16.384
-  Oh, shit!

52:21.931 --> 52:23.015
What the hell?

52:34.485 --> 52:35.444
Hang on, B!

52:36.487 --> 52:37.572
We'll shake him!

52:56.757 --> 52:58.342
What is with this guy?

53:11.439 --> 53:13.107
What the fuck?

53:13.983 --> 53:18.237
This doesn't make any goddamn sense.
We put everything we had down there.

53:18.237 --> 53:20.364
He saw us, followed us.

53:20.364 --> 53:21.782
Bullshit!

53:21.782 --> 53:24.535
We took every precaution,
there is no way he saw us.

53:24.535 --> 53:26.203
But he knew we were up there.

53:26.996 --> 53:28.998
LD, are you sure you got--?

53:28.998 --> 53:30.124
Listen!

53:30.124 --> 53:32.335
Zero, we got made...

53:32.335 --> 53:34.629
somewhere along the line
while we were setting that trap.

53:34.629 --> 53:36.380
No way. There's no way.

53:37.298 --> 53:39.759
He knew. Somehow.

53:45.473 --> 53:46.390
Oh, shit.

53:47.224 --> 53:48.059
What?

53:49.393 --> 53:52.104
Why the hell are you
looking at me like a creepy old man?

53:52.104 --> 53:53.814
- Ah, shit.
- Yeah.

53:53.814 --> 53:54.941
What?

53:54.941 --> 53:56.651
Zoric didn't put it on you.

53:57.526 --> 53:58.986
It's in you.

53:58.986 --> 54:01.364
He stitched it into your bullet wound.

54:02.156 --> 54:04.575
We don't have a choice, LD.
We gotta cut it out.

54:10.331 --> 54:11.332
Which one?

54:14.919 --> 54:19.215
Okay. There's a 25% chance
we only have to do this once.

54:19.215 --> 54:21.801
- Just do it.
- You sure you know what you're doing?

54:21.801 --> 54:24.053
No, I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

54:24.053 --> 54:26.430
But I'm the one
with the most field training, remember?

54:26.430 --> 54:29.976
- But does that really make you qualified?
- You're the one who said it.

54:29.976 --> 54:31.936
I'm sorry, I'm just really nervous.

54:31.936 --> 54:33.354
- You're nervous?
- Sorry.

54:33.354 --> 54:35.773
- Can I please go?
- Go!

54:42.321 --> 54:43.531
Little more light.

54:47.660 --> 54:49.370
- Light. Light.
- I don't know what you want.

54:49.370 --> 54:51.580
- You gotta be more specific.
- I want more light!

54:55.251 --> 54:56.752
Sorry. Sorry.

54:56.752 --> 55:00.214
I can't really see anything,
so I'm just trying to go a little deeper.

55:01.924 --> 55:03.926
You're done. Zero, you do it.

55:03.926 --> 55:05.469
Oh, yeah. I don't know, LD.

55:05.469 --> 55:06.929
- Do it!
- Okay.

55:07.888 --> 55:08.723
Okay.

55:12.768 --> 55:13.769
Okay.

55:14.478 --> 55:18.524
I'm so sorry. Here we go.

55:24.071 --> 55:26.991
- You a fucking butcher?
- I'm certainly not a doctor!

55:28.242 --> 55:29.869
Ah, shit.

55:34.540 --> 55:37.460
- Anything?
- No. Nothing. Sorry.

55:38.711 --> 55:41.672
- So you want me to go to the other one?
- No! Brandon!

55:41.672 --> 55:42.757
Okay.

55:57.646 --> 56:00.149
- Light.
- Holy shit. I'm gonna fucking punch you.

56:04.028 --> 56:05.905
- Bingo.
- Oh, hell, yes!

56:06.947 --> 56:09.492
Okay. Now we just need to get it out.

56:10.993 --> 56:12.912
Tweezers probably would have been
a good idea.

56:12.912 --> 56:15.706
Yes, Captain Hindsight,
that would have been ideal.

56:16.499 --> 56:18.334
I'm gonna go as quickly as possible, okay?

56:18.334 --> 56:19.293
Uh-huh.

56:24.715 --> 56:27.259
- Got it! Got it! Done.
- Oh, thank God.

56:31.430 --> 56:32.848
Now we just gotta destroy it.

56:33.641 --> 56:34.892
No.

56:34.892 --> 56:38.229
This time, we'll set a trap
that actually works.

56:49.532 --> 56:53.077
<i>♪ You can run on for a long time ♪</i>

56:53.077 --> 56:58.707

59:49.920 --> 59:53.090
Okay. Now we destroy this damn chip.

59:54.466 --> 59:55.968
Would you like to do the honors?

01:00:11.567 --> 01:00:13.152
Is it done?

01:00:13.152 --> 01:00:14.528
<i>No, it isn't.</i>

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:16.947
Hello, Papa.

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:22.286
Hello, Yuki.

01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:24.288
<i>If you want me...</i>

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:27.166
I say where and when.

01:00:27.166 --> 01:00:30.919
Come alone. I'll do the same.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:32.588
Send the address.

01:01:56.088 --> 01:01:59.425
If I navigated this correctly,
and I know I did,

01:01:59.425 --> 01:02:02.511
we're directly beneath Bubalo's palace.

01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:03.846
I'll keep a lookout.

01:02:04.805 --> 01:02:06.723
You find the security footage.

01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:10.102
We're still not close enough
for me to access the local network.

01:02:10.102 --> 01:02:13.105
- We're directly beneath it.
- Yeah, in a cave.

01:02:13.105 --> 01:02:17.651
Not a great place to get a strong signal.
We're gonna have to go in on foot.

01:02:24.575 --> 01:02:26.201
Still no sign of a network.

01:02:27.161 --> 01:02:28.954
We need to get closer.

01:02:28.954 --> 01:02:30.205
How much closer?

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:33.625
We're practically in the goddamn house.

01:02:46.388 --> 01:02:47.431
Nothing?

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:48.640
Still nothing.

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:54.480
Damn it!

01:02:55.647 --> 01:02:58.066
- I'll have to boost you over this gate.
- I got it.

01:02:58.066 --> 01:03:00.944
- The footage?
- Not so fast.

01:03:00.944 --> 01:03:02.237
I have signal.

01:03:02.237 --> 01:03:06.950
Now I just need to get into the network.

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:08.327
Boom. In.

01:03:09.077 --> 01:03:11.622
That was ridiculously easy.

01:03:11.622 --> 01:03:14.833
For a man of Ivan Bubalo's status,
he really needs to up his IT game.

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:16.502
Security footage, please.

01:03:17.085 --> 01:03:18.795
Yeah. What was the date?

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.297
Three days ago.

01:03:21.215 --> 01:03:22.549
Okay.

01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:25.427
Seriously, who is running his IT?

01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:27.387
The whole database is super unorganized.

01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:30.933
We'll leave your résumé in the mailbox.
Right now, we need the footage.

01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:34.770
Whoa! What?

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:41.652
Okay.

01:03:44.363 --> 01:03:47.157
Okay, that was close.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:03:47.908 --> 01:03:49.201
Okay, okay, okay.

01:03:50.994 --> 01:03:52.996
Okay. Okay, I found the footage.

01:03:53.789 --> 01:03:58.961
But there's, like, a dozen angles
and the files are encrypted.

01:03:58.961 --> 01:04:01.964
What are you saying?
That we came all this way for nothing?

01:04:01.964 --> 01:04:03.715
No, no. I should be able to decrypt it.

01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:06.510
I mean, this IT guy is seriously amateur.

01:04:10.931 --> 01:04:15.727
Yeah. Wow, that was just too easy.
Okay, we're good.

01:04:15.727 --> 01:04:21.066
And I have eyes on Brandon
and a very angry-looking Japanese man.

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:23.068
Soshi Mifune.

01:04:23.777 --> 01:04:26.196
We need to find him. He's our only lead.

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:29.616
-  How do you propose we do that?
- Do you know who I am?

01:04:30.576 --> 01:04:31.618
- Okay.

01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:32.703
What the--?

01:04:34.413 --> 01:04:36.582
-  Let's go. We gotta jam.
- No, no. My laptop.

01:04:36.582 --> 01:04:38.333
-  Forget the damn laptop.
-  No!

01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:12.951
Looks like your intel was right.

01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:15.746
- That's him.
-  I read about this.

01:05:15.746 --> 01:05:18.498
This is Bubalo's version
of Guantanamo Bay.

01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:24.171
Okay. I guess we're going in on foot.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:26.423
We?

01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:30.594
I'm sorry, sir, I wanna help,
but my weapon is my computer,

01:05:30.594 --> 01:05:32.054
which I no longer have.

01:05:32.054 --> 01:05:34.765
I know. And you're damn good.

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:38.894
But today, G.R.I.T. needs more out of you.

01:05:39.561 --> 01:05:42.522
With all due respect, sir,
I'm not officially a member of G.R.I.T.

01:05:47.819 --> 01:05:48.904
You are now.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:51.615
Let's go.

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:54.284
I don't even know how to use this.

01:05:55.494 --> 01:05:56.495
I'll teach you.

01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:58.288
Do this.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:00.874
Let's move.

01:06:06.713 --> 01:06:07.798
Ah, fuck.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.480
There's gotta be another way in.

01:06:34.741 --> 01:06:36.118
Wait, wait, wait.

01:06:37.119 --> 01:06:38.620
My laptop's still at the palace.

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:40.956
I should be able to access it
with my phone.

01:06:41.832 --> 01:06:44.292
And access
all of Bubalo's security cameras?

01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:45.419
Exactly.

01:06:52.968 --> 01:06:54.636
-  I'm in.
-  Okay, let's go.

01:06:58.682 --> 01:07:01.017
Uh, let's see. There's a lot of cameras.

01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:05.814
I think we're... Let me just find them.

01:07:07.065 --> 01:07:08.442
Oh, okay. That's us.

01:07:08.442 --> 01:07:12.988
So... Okay, looks like
that guard is right--

01:07:12.988 --> 01:07:14.072
Oh, shit.

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.079
Good going, Pete.

01:07:21.079 --> 01:07:23.832
You shot him. You shot him.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:28.879
Wait, let me get my footing here.

01:07:28.879 --> 01:07:32.132
We're on Camera 6, so that's probably--

01:07:32.132 --> 01:07:33.759
Wait, wait, wait!

01:07:42.851 --> 01:07:43.685
Clear.

01:08:03.622 --> 01:08:06.249
- I found Prince Caspian.
- Lead the way.

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:08.084
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:08:08.794 --> 01:08:11.213
- There's people in there.
- Sounds like it.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:13.965
Well, that guy had keys.

01:08:13.965 --> 01:08:15.509
Eyes on the mission.

01:08:21.181 --> 01:08:23.225
Oh, shit. They have LD.

01:08:23.934 --> 01:08:25.227
They have LD!

01:09:00.095 --> 01:09:01.096
Yuki.

01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:03.765
Lady Death.

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:07.143
Daughter.

01:09:08.562 --> 01:09:10.480
I'm not your daughter.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:16.027
No, I suppose not.

01:09:19.489 --> 01:09:21.241
I'm as impressed by you as ever.

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:24.786
But you know...

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:28.164
as you've always known...

01:09:29.291 --> 01:09:31.585
it would all catch up to you one day.

01:09:33.044 --> 01:09:34.129
You've lost.

01:09:37.924 --> 01:09:39.342
You're with her?

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:41.595
Ah.

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:44.848
We realized we had similar interests.

01:09:46.641 --> 01:09:47.809
Namely...

01:09:48.727 --> 01:09:49.686
seeing you dead.

01:09:53.315 --> 01:09:54.608
Does that upset you?

01:09:54.608 --> 01:09:55.525
Hm?

01:09:57.235 --> 01:09:58.695
Do you feel you're being treated unfairly?

01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:02.699
I don't feel anything.

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:09.247
Because you realize, I have no choice.

01:10:10.332 --> 01:10:11.541
There's a code.

01:10:11.917 --> 01:10:12.834
There's a system.

01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:16.171
Lest we forget...

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:19.174
you tried to kill me first.

01:10:21.968 --> 01:10:24.930
Even if I wanted to let you live...

01:10:27.432 --> 01:10:28.600
it's not my choice.

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:33.688
Do you want to let me live?

01:10:47.035 --> 01:10:47.869
No.

01:10:54.209 --> 01:10:55.627
Then do it.

01:11:14.896 --> 01:11:16.314
Come on...

01:11:19.484 --> 01:11:20.485
Papa.

01:11:31.663 --> 01:11:32.497
Wait!

01:11:36.418 --> 01:11:38.294
I want to pull the trigger.

01:11:45.051 --> 01:11:46.720
LD? Oh, shit.

01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:49.681
They have Zero and Brandon.

01:11:51.766 --> 01:11:53.435
God, a little heads-up!

01:11:53.435 --> 01:11:55.061
Sorry. I was getting into it.

01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:56.604
Okay, okay.

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:04.112
Wait, wait, wait.

01:12:18.043 --> 01:12:18.877
He dead?

01:12:19.586 --> 01:12:20.420
Yeah, looks like it.

01:12:21.212 --> 01:12:22.630
What's going on with the other guys?

01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:28.261
Sorry, we couldn't let you go alone.

01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:29.929
But you don't worry about us.

01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:32.223
You wanna kill him, you kill him.

01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:33.767
You do what you have to do.

01:12:52.494 --> 01:12:54.162
You're such a disappointment.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:58.500
I always win.

01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:01.127
God. Shoot him
in his fucking head right now.

01:13:16.684 --> 01:13:17.685
Always.

01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:53.638
Cover me.

01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:57.725
- How did you find us?
- We'll tell you later.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.275
Okay.

01:14:06.526 --> 01:14:08.987
Use your phone.
Find a safe route back to the car.

01:14:08.987 --> 01:14:11.197
Anybody comes at you, you know what to do.

01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:16.244
Exactly. Go.

01:16:23.705 --> 01:16:25.832
My fight is not with any of you.

01:16:25.832 --> 01:16:27.417
Please just let me pass.

01:16:56.779 --> 01:16:59.782
It's okay. It's okay, I'm here to help.

01:17:01.743 --> 01:17:02.910
Take these.

01:17:04.454 --> 01:17:07.540
Go to the cells.
Get everybody out. I'll cover you.

01:17:13.588 --> 01:17:14.964
You might need this.

01:17:35.902 --> 01:17:39.072
Honestly, that was pretty easy.
Thought there'd be more of them.

01:20:53.057 --> 01:20:55.059
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:24:59.136 --> 01:25:00.262
Hey, I got him.

01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:02.306
You sure did, son.

01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:07.186
You sure did.

01:25:51.188 --> 01:25:52.731
<i>And in international news,</i>

01:25:52.731 --> 01:25:55.985
<i>the trial of Soshi Mifune,
one of Interpol's Most Wanted,</i>

01:25:55.985 --> 01:25:57.570

01:25:57.570 --> 01:26:00.739
<i>Mifune has finally been deemed fit
to stand trial</i>

01:26:00.739 --> 01:26:02.074

01:26:10.416 --> 01:26:12.293
<i>Fred, what do you make of this trial?</i>

01:26:12.293 --> 01:26:14.879
<i>Well, first, Preston,
thanks so much for having me on.</i>

01:26:14.879 --> 01:26:16.505
<i>This is a very interesting trial</i>

01:26:16.505 --> 01:26:20.009
<i>that many believed
would never really actually happen.</i>

01:26:20.009 --> 01:26:23.888
<i>Let's face it, Soshi Mifune had once

01:26:23.888 --> 01:26:25.055

<i>What do you make of that?</i>

01:26:29.643 --> 01:26:31.604
<i>Well, to me, that is a clear sign</i>

01:26:31.604 --> 01:26:33.480
<i>that the authorities want
to send a message</i>

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:37.568

01:26:37.568 --> 01:26:40.029

And end just as fast.

01:26:45.075 --> 01:26:46.619
He'll get a slap on the wrist

01:26:46.619 --> 01:26:48.954
and a short stay
in a minimum-security prison.

01:26:48.954 --> 01:26:50.456
Such bullshit.

01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:58.213
- Oh, snap!

01:26:58.797 --> 01:27:02.760
<i>Soshi Mifune appears

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:05.846
