We love candy apples!

00:35.600 --> 00:39.126
I love exploring corn mazes
that smell like poo.

00:40.692 --> 00:42.912
And I enjoy playing
in the fall leaves,

00:42.955 --> 00:46.263
which trigger
the seasonal allergies.

00:51.442 --> 00:52.878
Halloween is the best, yo!

00:55.838 --> 00:59.233
Hey, Robin, you almost finished
with that jack-o'-lantern?

00:59.711 --> 01:03.672
Just one more eye, and done!

01:05.761 --> 01:07.719
Truly, this is
the greatest jack-o'-lantern

01:07.763 --> 01:09.504
the world has ever seen.

01:09.547 --> 01:10.853
Hey! I've got an idea.

01:10.896 --> 01:13.334
We should turn
this jack-o'-lantern

01:13.377 --> 01:14.465
into a pumpkin man!

01:14.509 --> 01:15.640
Whoa!

01:17.033 --> 01:19.818
This big pumpkin will make
a nice round booty.

01:19.862 --> 01:22.517
And this medium-sized
pumpkin will create

01:22.560 --> 01:24.388
the sensible midsection.

01:24.432 --> 01:25.824
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

01:25.868 --> 01:28.653
These sticks will
make great arms!

01:28.697 --> 01:30.438
And a scarf to keep him warm.

01:31.569 --> 01:33.397
That looks great, guys.

01:33.441 --> 01:34.529
But what do we call him?

01:34.572 --> 01:36.400
How about Scary Davey?

01:36.444 --> 01:38.620
Ooh, El Gordo!

01:38.663 --> 01:39.664
The Oatmeal?

01:39.708 --> 01:41.013
How about Scary Davey?

01:41.057 --> 01:45.453
I know! We should call him
Pepo the Pumpkinman!

01:45.496 --> 01:47.759
Pepo!

01:47.803 --> 01:50.762
I wish Pepo could come to life
and have some fun with us.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.634
Well, I can make that happen.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.549
All I need is a magic hat.

01:58.553 --> 01:59.858
Well, what are you waiting for?

01:59.902 --> 02:03.166
Azarath Metrion Zinthos!

02:08.563 --> 02:10.478
Happy Halloween!

02:10.521 --> 02:11.827
No way! He's alive!

02:11.870 --> 02:14.612
It is the Halloween miracle.

02:14.656 --> 02:17.311
Hey, friends.
It's nice to meet--

02:18.399 --> 02:19.791
Hey! What gives?

02:19.835 --> 02:21.706
Pepo can only stay alive
while he's wearing the hat.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.360
Halloween Magic rules.

02:23.708 --> 02:25.710

Yo, let me try.

02:33.414 --> 02:34.806

02:34.850 --> 02:36.982
You guys are all right.
Now, what do you say

02:37.026 --> 02:39.768
we go scare some kids
and take their candy?

03:25.814 --> 03:29.339
Well, I'm sure glad
you guys had fun.

03:31.776 --> 03:34.431
Uh, what's up
with your face, bro?

03:35.650 --> 03:36.955
And what's with that smell?

03:36.999 --> 03:38.914
You smell like
hot garbage, man.

03:38.957 --> 03:42.265
Ooh. I know
what's going on here.

03:44.746 --> 03:46.748
Pepo is starting to decompose.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.141
Oh, no! This is terrible.

03:49.185 --> 03:51.883
I don't want to become
a pile of stinky mush.

03:51.927 --> 03:54.930
We must do something
to save our new friend.

03:54.973 --> 03:57.715
Don't worry. I've read
that petroleum jelly

03:57.759 --> 03:59.630
can keep
a jack-o'-lantern fresh.

03:59.674 --> 04:01.415
Now, let's give it a try.

04:02.938 --> 04:04.766
Do you feel the fresh?

04:04.809 --> 04:06.115
No. Just slimy.

04:06.158 --> 04:09.597
Mm. Maybe you have to coat
the insides as well.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.426
Oh, I don't feel so--

04:14.689 --> 04:16.604
Please! No more!

04:16.647 --> 04:17.953
Ugh. Now what?

04:17.996 --> 04:20.477
My mom always sprayed
her pumpkins with bleach.

04:26.701 --> 04:27.702
Is it working?

04:27.745 --> 04:29.138
No, it just burns!

04:29.181 --> 04:31.880
Oh. Then, perhaps
the ice will preserve

04:31.923 --> 04:34.317
our winter squash friend.

04:36.537 --> 04:37.668
This feels good.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.104
Good thinking, Star.

04:39.148 --> 04:40.845
But we need to figure out
a more permanent solution.

04:40.889 --> 04:43.021
I know. We should take Pepo
to the North Pole

04:43.065 --> 04:45.763
where the cold temperatures
will keep him fresh year round.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.983
Great idea!
But how do we get there?

04:48.026 --> 04:50.290
It's going to be
an epic journey.

04:50.333 --> 04:53.771
<i>First, we must ride through
the Haunted Hollow,</i>

04:53.815 --> 04:55.207
<i>past the Witch's Gate,</i>

04:55.251 --> 04:58.733
<i>and finally face
the Abominable Snowman.</i>

04:59.908 --> 05:01.866
This trip
sounds dangerous.

05:01.910 --> 05:03.955
Yes, but for a new friend
we barely know

05:03.999 --> 05:06.828
it's worth the risk.
Titans, go!

05:06.871 --> 05:09.396
Save Pepo the Pumpkinman!

05:17.882 --> 05:19.101
How much further
till we get out of these woods?

05:19.144 --> 05:21.669
This place is
giving me the creeps.

05:21.712 --> 05:22.931
Look. Maybe we can find out

05:22.974 --> 05:25.499
from that short fellow
on the horse.

05:26.848 --> 05:27.979
That dude's not short!

05:28.023 --> 05:30.591
He's like, headless, man!

05:35.900 --> 05:37.859
It's the headless horseman.

05:37.902 --> 05:39.208
And he's after Pepo's head!

05:39.251 --> 05:41.210
Get away from him,
you headless jerk!

05:41.253 --> 05:45.649
Never! His head belongs
to me!

05:50.785 --> 05:53.744
Ugh, he's all gross.

05:53.788 --> 05:55.267
And he's leaking
all over my cape.

05:55.311 --> 05:58.923
Oh! Now I'm gonna
have to get this dry cleaned.

06:01.230 --> 06:04.668
I'm sorry that
I ever ran into you jerks.

06:07.845 --> 06:10.500
Phew! That was close.

06:13.155 --> 06:15.810
Yo, this must
be the Witch's Gate.

06:15.853 --> 06:16.941
But it's so big.

06:16.985 --> 06:18.769
How are we gonna get past it?

06:18.813 --> 06:20.467
Simple. We knock.

06:24.993 --> 06:27.909
Oh, trick-or-treaters.

06:27.952 --> 06:29.389
- Hello.
- Sorry to bother you,

06:29.432 --> 06:32.740
but we need to get through
so we can save our friend.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.002
Sure, sure.

06:34.045 --> 06:36.004
It'll cost you though.

06:36.047 --> 06:37.701
We don't have any money.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.921
Then how about that hat?

06:39.964 --> 06:41.096
No way. This hat is

06:41.139 --> 06:43.054
the only thing keeping
our friend alive.

06:43.098 --> 06:45.927
So it's a magic hat.
Even better.

06:45.970 --> 06:47.232
How about I trade you for it?

06:47.276 --> 06:49.974
I've got some wonderful
Halloween treats.

06:50.018 --> 06:54.414
Like these
brand new toothbrushes.

06:55.023 --> 06:58.722
- No.
- Then what about
this bag of pennies?

06:58.766 --> 06:59.897
- No.
- Wow.

06:59.941 --> 07:01.421
You kids drive a hard bargain.

07:01.464 --> 07:04.989
But I've got something
no trick-or-treater can resist.

07:05.033 --> 07:08.558
A great big can
of tomato soup!

07:08.906 --> 07:10.038
Nah, girl.

07:10.081 --> 07:12.780
Very well. If you won't
give me the hat,

07:12.823 --> 07:13.998
then I'll just have to--

07:14.042 --> 07:15.739
- Yoink!
- Hey!

07:15.783 --> 07:17.611
Let that go!

07:17.654 --> 07:18.612
Ow!

07:19.874 --> 07:21.266
Happy Halloween!

07:21.310 --> 07:24.008
Let's get
out of here, yo!

07:24.052 --> 07:26.533
You're not going anywhere.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.505
Rotten kids!

07:47.031 --> 07:48.859
We're almost there, Pepo.

07:48.903 --> 07:50.252
What a relief.

07:50.295 --> 07:53.734
I don't think I'm going to
last much longer.

07:57.912 --> 07:59.130
Oh, no. We can't bring in

07:59.174 --> 08:01.698
- any fruits or vegetables.

08:02.133 --> 08:04.527
Quick! Help Pepo hide.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.753
Welcome to the North Pole.

08:12.796 --> 08:14.015
Anything to declare?

08:14.058 --> 08:16.844
Uh, nothing but this boring,
lifeless hay.

08:25.113 --> 08:26.157
Contraband!

08:27.463 --> 08:30.814
I'll teach you to ignore
customs regulations.

09:01.149 --> 09:02.890
It's up to you now, Pepo.

09:03.847 --> 09:05.196
But look at me.

09:05.240 --> 09:08.025
I'm in no shape to stop him.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.331
Yes, you can.

09:09.374 --> 09:11.855
You just need to unleash
the magic from your hat.

09:12.987 --> 09:15.642
My hat. Of course!

09:19.254 --> 09:22.213
You leave my friends alone!

09:22.257 --> 09:26.130
Halloween night
frights, attack!

09:26.174 --> 09:29.743
No. No, no. Help.

09:31.048 --> 09:33.094
You did it, Pepo! You did it.

09:37.228 --> 09:39.448
Oh, no. He is
the wasting way!

09:39.491 --> 09:42.669
We have to get him
across the border now.

09:50.024 --> 09:52.722
I'm not going to make it.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.986
Pepo, don't go.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.379
You have so much of the scaring

09:57.422 --> 10:01.078
of the innocent children
still to do.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.602
Hey.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.212
It's cool.

10:04.255 --> 10:05.561

10:05.605 --> 10:08.433
to head to the big,
abandoned department store

10:08.477 --> 10:10.435
that turns
into a Halloween shop

10:10.479 --> 10:14.309
one month out of the year...
in the sky.

10:14.352 --> 10:18.052
But we'll never
forget you, Pepo.

10:20.924 --> 10:23.013
Goodbye.

10:23.057 --> 10:28.018
And Happy... Halloween.

10:32.370 --> 10:35.199
Hi, everybody! Welcome to the--

on there.
