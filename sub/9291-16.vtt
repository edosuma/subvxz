00:14.280 --> 00:19.560
Whatever you've planned next is going to fail,
just like everything else you've tried today.

00:19.640 --> 00:24.200
Almost 40 dead in the train crash, many more
near the San Gabriel Island nuclear plant.

00:24.280 --> 00:27.640
We managed to stop the other 103
power plants from melting down.

00:27.720 --> 00:30.160
That's what America will remember,
that we stopped you.

00:30.600 --> 00:34.440
No. This country will be afraid
to let their leaders appear in public.

00:34.520 --> 00:39.640
For all the hatred that you have for this
country, you don't understand it very well.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.520
Marwan.

00:45.600 --> 00:51.440
In the next few minutes CTU will be alerted
that the pilot and his family are missing.

00:51.520 --> 00:52.599
What do you think we should do?

00:52.600 --> 00:56.000
We have to make sure CTU is too busy
to realise its significance.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.640
Jack Bauer is alive and in my custody.

00:58.720 --> 01:02.480
I will return him to you unharmed
in exchange for Behrooz Araz.

01:03.320 --> 01:07.440
This is Bill Buchanan from Division.
He'll be overseeing the operation.

01:07.520 --> 01:10.360
What happens if we don't
agree to the exchange?

01:10.440 --> 01:13.760
- We don't get Bauer back.
- That can't be the deciding factor.

01:13.840 --> 01:18.280
If we don't go through with this,
we may lose an opportunity to trap Marwan.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.680
Is my mother in the van?
She was working with you. Where is she?

01:22.760 --> 01:25.560
- I don't know.
- I don't wanna die.

01:27.920 --> 01:31.360
Sniper's down! Move out!

01:31.440 --> 01:32.720
Why'd you give 'em that kid?

01:32.800 --> 01:35.840
He's double-tagged.
We'll be tracking him.

01:35.920 --> 01:39.400
I managed to short-circuit
some phone lines.

01:39.480 --> 01:43.240
If you can find two service obstructions at
the same coordinates, we can get to Marwan.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.640
We have a location
where Marwan was holding Jack.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.400
- Yes.
- There's a problem.

01:51.480 --> 01:54.240
As I was about to do a pre-flight check,
they grounded the plane.

01:54.320 --> 01:55.920
Resolve this now.

01:56.320 --> 01:59.640
- Did you report to the chief officer?
- I'm about to head over there now.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.160
Don't let me hold you up.

02:02.240 --> 02:05.560
- It's just a false alarm.
- All right. I'll clear it for takeoff.

02:16.960 --> 02:21.320
We placed multiple trackers on Behrooz Araz
but those are no longer transmitting,

02:21.400 --> 02:24.160
which means that Marwan's men
destroyed them.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.880
- "Are you close to finding Marwan?"
- " We may be.

02:26.960 --> 02:29.840
Bauer tagged the location
where he was being held.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.400
We're preparing to mount a raid as we speak.

02:32.480 --> 02:37.800
I want Marwan found now. I've asked
Secret Service to secure a landing site

02:37.880 --> 02:41.520
so I can be on the ground
to address the nation before 11 o'clock.

02:41.600 --> 02:44.160
Sir, we believe that you're safer in the air.

02:44.240 --> 02:49.120
I have been flying for 20 hours. The people
need to hear from me now, not tomorrow.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.120
Then may I suggest
you do it from Air Force One?

02:52.200 --> 02:55.720
It may not be optimal,
but at least you'll get your message across.

02:55.800 --> 03:01.000
I appreciate your concerns, but I'm going
to give my speech when I get to Los Angeles.

03:01.080 --> 03:05.240
I'll inform the press corps,
give them enough time to notify their outlets.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.420
Yes, sir.

03:06.440 --> 03:10.040
Make sure I'm briefed on Bauer's progress
before I go on the air.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.320
Of course.

03:14.720 --> 03:16.640
What's Jack's status?

03:16.720 --> 03:19.920
His team just arrived.
They'll be in place in a few minutes.

03:30.360 --> 03:33.640
- " CTU."
- Strike teams are moving into final position.

03:33.720 --> 03:38.440
- We're five minutes out. How's your end?
- We're coordinating backup teams.

03:38.520 --> 03:41.200
- Chloe?
- It's me. Michelle brought me back in.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.360
Good. Are the satellites in position?

03:43.440 --> 03:48.080
Yes. We've been monitoring the area,
but there's been no activity.

03:48.160 --> 03:52.440
- How's Paul doing? Is he still in surgery?
- Uh, no, he just got out.

03:52.520 --> 03:56.560
Chloe, I'm glad to have you back.
We're gonna need your help. Is Audrey there?

03:56.640 --> 03:59.440
- I think so.
- Let me speak to her.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.520
Hold on.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.800
- Hello?
- Audrey, I have Jack on the line.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.960
- "Are you there?"
- Yeah, I'm here.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.240
- Hold for Jack.
- OK.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.520
- " Audrey."
- Jack, you OK?

04:23.600 --> 04:26.080
Yeah, I'm fine. How's Paul doing?

04:26.560 --> 04:29.880
They just finished operating,
but they said he's gonna make it.

04:29.960 --> 04:34.760
- I'm waiting to talk to the doctors.
- Good, I'm glad.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.400
Look.

04:37.480 --> 04:43.080
Audrey, I know we have to talk
about how I handled everything with Paul.

04:43.160 --> 04:45.800
Yeah, we do. It's just...

04:47.720 --> 04:51.800
- It's really hard right now.
- Yeah, I-I understand.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.800
- Are you out in the field?
- We're getting ready to move on Marwan.

04:56.880 --> 05:01.000
- Be careful.
- Yeah. I'll call you as soon as it's done.

05:01.520 --> 05:03.000
Yeah.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.960
Right.

05:12.840 --> 05:15.960
I got off the phone with DOD.
They wanna know our status.

05:16.040 --> 05:19.440
Jack's team has been deployed.
He should begin the assault soon.

05:19.520 --> 05:23.960
- Do you know how many hostiles are inside?
- Based on the infrared scan, eight.

05:24.040 --> 05:26.960
Did voice transmission indicate
one of them is Marwan?

05:27.040 --> 05:30.160
No, but we know he was there
25 minutes ago when Jack left.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.600
If that hard drive is discovered
by the Americans,

05:33.680 --> 05:36.080
it'll jeopardise the next phase of our plan.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.840
- It's not here.
- You haven't looked hard enough.

05:38.920 --> 05:41.640
I've been searching for almost an hour.

05:41.720 --> 05:45.640
Aziz told one of his men he hid a backup copy
of those files in his apartment.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.880
Why didn't Aziz tell you where he hid it?

05:47.960 --> 05:50.840
Because he was killed
before he could tell me.

05:50.920 --> 05:55.520
Anderson shared this apartment with Aziz.
Maybe he knows where the hard drive is.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.440
Keep looking. I'll try to contact him.

06:05.960 --> 06:09.160
Bravo three-niner in the air, heading 552.

06:09.240 --> 06:12.920
Roger Bravo three-niner.
You are cleared for 35,000ft.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.960
Bravo three-niner ascending to 35,000ft.

06:16.040 --> 06:18.280
Copy that.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.640
I'm in the air.
I should reach the target in 45 minutes.

06:33.720 --> 06:36.000
- We have a problem.
- "What kind of problem?"

06:36.080 --> 06:40.560
Aziz. He hid a backup copy of his files
in your apartment on hard drive.

06:40.640 --> 06:43.200
- We haven't been able to find it.
- Ask Aziz.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.640
Aziz is dead.

06:48.520 --> 06:52.240
- I don't know about a hard drive.
- You have no idea where it might be?

06:52.320 --> 06:55.560
If I knew where it was, I'd tell you.

06:56.720 --> 07:00.520
- I just don't want to get myself killed.
- "I'll get back to you."

07:33.560 --> 07:37.160
In order to flush Marwan out,
lead your men down the main corridor.

07:37.240 --> 07:41.160
- He'll try and escape through the left flank.
- Tac teams are ready to go in.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.280
- Have they set the charges?
- Yes.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.040
Gentlemen, we are go.

07:46.120 --> 07:50.920
We've got a green light.
Teams A and B, move into position.

07:59.840 --> 08:04.400
- All teams move in on target.
- " All teams, all teams..."

08:04.480 --> 08:07.200
Prepare to ignite charges on my mark.

08:07.280 --> 08:10.200
Three, two, one,

08:10.280 --> 08:12.240
blow the door!

08:22.560 --> 08:23.920
Go, go! Move!

08:29.720 --> 08:32.679
Delete the files. Delete everything.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.440
They're down! They're down!

09:11.520 --> 09:13.240
All right, let's go!

09:59.000 --> 10:01.440
- Hold your fire!
- Clear!

10:14.480 --> 10:17.200
Marwan's not here. Notify the perimeter.

10:17.280 --> 10:22.200
" Teams one and two, Marwan is not
in the building. Maintain your perimeter.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.360
Come on!

10:26.000 --> 10:29.200
I can't stop this thing from deleting.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.560
This doesn't make sense.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.920
This room's hot. Get your men out.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.960
Get your men outta here right now!

10:59.680 --> 11:02.160
What's happening?
What's going on over there?

11:02.240 --> 11:04.000
- You OK?
- I think so.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.120
- Check your men!
- Jack, if you can hear me, respond.

11:07.200 --> 11:11.520
Michelle, Marwan's escaped. He just blew up
the hard drive to all his computers.

11:11.600 --> 11:17.480
He's covering his tracks. I'm going off comm.
If you want me, I'm gonna be on my cell.

11:18.600 --> 11:24.500
Chloe, get data forensics in there now,
and start a hard target search for Marwan.

11:29.960 --> 11:32.840
Get me a medic! Medic!

11:32.920 --> 11:36.160
Too late. You can't stop it.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.240
Stop what?

11:39.400 --> 11:42.000
Within the hour.

11:42.080 --> 11:45.160
What's gonna happen within the hour?

11:45.360 --> 11:48.440
What's gonna happen within the hour?

12:12.280 --> 12:14.320
- Mrs Raines?
- Yes.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.040
- Your husband's in recovery.
- How is he?

12:17.120 --> 12:20.440
He's stable. One of the bullets
did some damage to his spine.

12:20.520 --> 12:24.320
Right now he's paralysed
from the waist down.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.720
- Is it permanent?
- It's too early to tell.

12:27.800 --> 12:31.760
It'll take weeks or months before we
fully understand the extent of damage.

12:31.840 --> 12:34.280
So he could regain the use of his legs.

12:34.360 --> 12:36.560
It's possible, yes.

12:39.360 --> 12:43.240
- But not likely?
- Again, it's too early to tell.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.360
We could go over the details later,

12:45.440 --> 12:50.200
but I'd be lying to you
if I told you I was optimistic.

12:50.280 --> 12:53.440
A lot depends on his attitude,
his support system,

12:53.520 --> 12:55.720
emotional as well as medical.

13:01.360 --> 13:04.080
- Does he know?
- Yes, I just told him.

13:05.640 --> 13:09.120
- I'm sure he'd like to see you.
- Thank you.

13:28.200 --> 13:32.640
Excuse me, can you give us a minute, please?
Thank you.

13:37.040 --> 13:40.680
Oh, no, don't you even
think of feeling sorry for me.

13:40.760 --> 13:43.360
Whatever they say, I'm gonna walk again.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.560
I know you will.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.080
So, where's Jack?

13:59.160 --> 14:01.320
He's still out in the field.

14:01.400 --> 14:06.520
He called a little while ago
and wanted to know how you were doing.

14:07.560 --> 14:10.800
He knows that bullet was meant for him.

14:10.880 --> 14:14.680
I was trying to push him out of the way.
I didn't expect to get shot myself.

14:14.760 --> 14:19.360
What you did was very, very brave, Paul.

14:34.320 --> 14:38.840
LAPD's widening the search perimeter,
but so far they're coming up empty.

14:38.920 --> 14:42.480
- Something might happen within the hour.
- We're gonna find him.

14:42.560 --> 14:46.880
- Did you secure Marwan yet?
- He must have slipped through the perimeter.

14:46.960 --> 14:50.040
- How could you let that happen?
- It doesn't matter how.

14:50.120 --> 14:54.400
What matters is that he's gone and we're
doing everything we can to find him.

14:54.480 --> 14:57.200
What exactly are you doing to find him?

14:57.280 --> 15:02.520
We've widened the perimeter, set up a search
grid. State police are conducting a sweep.

15:02.600 --> 15:06.560
- Jack says he's got something.
- Put him on speaker.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.920
It's Michelle.
You're also on with Tony and Bill Buchanan.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.080
OK, look. Marwan had an area
set up for forging documents.

15:13.160 --> 15:17.200
Some of them survived the explosion.
We secured a number of names and faces.

15:17.280 --> 15:21.400
Castle's uploading them now.
Cross-reference them with the watch list.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.360
- We'll do it now.
- Get back to me if you've got a match.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.720
Edgar.

15:25.800 --> 15:29.120
- I'm initialising the software now.
- Good.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.200
" Michelle.

15:33.080 --> 15:36.480
Listen, um, I'm sorry if I snapped.

15:37.360 --> 15:40.840
It's OK. We're all under a lot of pressure.

15:41.680 --> 15:43.640
You holding up?

15:43.720 --> 15:45.800
I'm fine.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.360
- Edgar, how's that uplink?
- Coming up.

15:57.680 --> 16:00.520
Chloe, how long's Buchanan
been at Division?

16:00.600 --> 16:05.760
I don't know. It took them a while to fill
Chappelle's position. Six months?

16:05.840 --> 16:09.480
- Where was he before that?
- Seattle, I think.

16:09.560 --> 16:10.660
Seattle?

16:10.720 --> 16:14.320
That's where Michelle was posted
while you were in jail, right?

16:14.400 --> 16:16.120
Yeah.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.040
Thanks.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.080
We got a match.

16:25.480 --> 16:28.240
This is Bauer.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.480
We have a match on one of those photos.
He's on the FBI watch list.

16:31.560 --> 16:34.400
- His name is Mitch Anderson.
- What do we got on him?

16:34.480 --> 16:37.960
Ex-military,
arrested for drug possession, served time,

16:38.040 --> 16:40.560
was dishonourably discharged
four years ago.

16:40.640 --> 16:43.760
He's been hired as a mercenary
in a number of conflicts.

16:43.840 --> 16:47.240
- Came back to the US about a year ago.
- Is he under investigation?

16:47.320 --> 16:50.440
He was moved up the list,
but he wasn't made a priority.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.880
The bureau sent an agent to his apartment.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.680
- Has the agent checked in?
- They may be in transit.

16:55.760 --> 16:59.280
OK. Get me an address on Anderson,
start digging up information,

16:59.360 --> 17:01.320
and get me a number for the FBI agent.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.520
I'm on it.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.839
FBI. I'm looking for Mitch Anderson.

17:14.839 --> 17:18.640
This is FBI Agent Drake.
Please open the door.

17:52.840 --> 17:56.360
- Agent Drake.
- Hi. My name is Jack Bauer. I work with CTU.

17:56.440 --> 17:59.800
Your office said you were
investigating Mitch Anderson.

17:59.880 --> 18:03.040
- I got to his apartment a few minutes ago.
- He's not there?

18:03.120 --> 18:06.880
No. Why is CTU involved?
Is there new information about Anderson?

18:06.960 --> 18:09.920
We have evidence connecting him
to a man named Marwan.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.480
Marwan's responsible
for all the terrorist activity today.

18:13.560 --> 18:17.280
- We believe he's planning another attack.
- How is Anderson involved?

18:17.360 --> 18:21.000
- I'll advise you when I get there.
- How far away are you?

18:21.080 --> 18:24.280
- About ten minutes out.
- I'll be here.

18:24.360 --> 18:26.360
Thank you.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.800
" Yes."

19:06.880 --> 19:09.280
We had a delay.
We're heading over there now.

19:09.360 --> 19:13.080
- "What about Anderson?"
- He's in the air, on his way to the target.

19:13.160 --> 19:15.760
He's on schedule. Are your people in place?

19:15.840 --> 19:18.040
Yes. We're ready to deploy.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.920
Good. I'll see you when we arrive.

19:28.280 --> 19:31.960
I'm sorry, but this just isn't cutting it.
The tone is all wrong.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.000
Maybe I could give them
a clearer idea of what you want.

19:35.080 --> 19:38.600
This is one of the most traumatic days
in this country's history.

19:38.680 --> 19:42.960
What I want is a speech
that is equal to the occasion.

19:48.960 --> 19:53.440
Give me a few minutes, will you, Robert?
Let me think about this a little while longer.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.440
Of course, Mr President.

19:55.520 --> 19:58.480
Oh, and Robert,
ask my son to step in, will you?

19:58.560 --> 20:00.560
Yes, sir.

20:08.120 --> 20:10.520
Dad?

20:10.600 --> 20:16.400
A quick trip to Mexico, a low-key state visit,
then we'd have some time to spend together.

20:16.480 --> 20:21.360
It's OK. The, uh, press corps
has been keeping me entertained.

20:21.440 --> 20:26.320
You know, ever since your mother died,
I promised myself I'd be there for you.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.560
You were doing what you had to do.

20:31.600 --> 20:37.360
I could use your help right about now. I'm
gonna address the nation in about one hour.

20:37.440 --> 20:41.200
- I still don't have a speech I'm happy with.
- I'm no speech writer.

20:41.280 --> 20:44.480
No, I know, but you've got a level head,

20:45.280 --> 20:48.600
and you're about
the most decent person I know.

20:48.680 --> 20:53.520
As far as I'm concerned, you represent
the very best this country has to offer.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.680
So.

20:56.120 --> 21:01.800
What do you wanna hear the president say
when he addresses you tonight?

21:01.880 --> 21:03.880
The truth.

21:09.320 --> 21:12.640
We've been attacked by terrorists.

21:12.720 --> 21:16.480
Americans are dead.
The man responsible is still at large.

21:16.560 --> 21:20.200
We are by no means certain
we can catch him before he strikes again.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.920
What happened earlier...

21:23.840 --> 21:27.640
may be nothing
compared to what happens next.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.880
That's the truth, Kevin.

21:32.840 --> 21:35.720
Is that what you think I should say?

21:37.400 --> 21:39.400
I don't know.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.640
Neither do I,

21:42.720 --> 21:45.040
but the fact remains...

21:45.840 --> 21:47.920
I have to say something.

21:51.040 --> 21:54.240
Do you want me to help you figure it out?

21:57.160 --> 21:59.160
Absolutely.

22:14.680 --> 22:17.160
" Agent Drake?

22:21.960 --> 22:23.960
Agent Drake?

22:33.880 --> 22:36.760
- Drop the weapon now!
- Are you Agent Bauer?

22:36.840 --> 22:39.560
- Yes! Holster your weapon!
- I need to see your ID.

22:39.640 --> 22:43.240
I don't have ID.
I'm working with CTU on a provisional basis.

22:43.320 --> 22:46.680
I talked to you ten minutes ago.
You can confirm with Division.

22:46.760 --> 22:51.840
Agent Drake, just take it easy.
He's with me. Agent Hart, CTU.

22:51.920 --> 22:54.120
Now I'm gonna holster my gun,

22:54.200 --> 22:57.440
and I'm gonna show you my credentials.

23:04.400 --> 23:07.200
I'm sorry.
But with everything that happened today,

23:07.280 --> 23:09.640
- you can't be too careful.
- I understand.

23:09.720 --> 23:15.480
We just intercepted a call indicating Anderson
was in possession of computer files

23:15.560 --> 23:17.760
that could tell us Marwan's next target.

23:17.840 --> 23:23.560
- What's the source of the intercepted call?
- I'm still waiting for the details.

23:23.640 --> 23:29.360
- Did you find the apartment like this?
- No. There may be a backup copy of the files.

23:29.440 --> 23:31.840
I was trying to find it.

23:34.440 --> 23:39.400
Right now Anderson's our only lead. We're
gonna stay here and help you finish the job.

23:39.480 --> 23:42.400
Do a canvass. I'll take upstairs.

23:59.800 --> 24:02.120
- Where are you?
- I'm almost in position.

24:02.200 --> 24:05.360
- What's the problem?
- Is my cover in place?

24:05.440 --> 24:09.480
I've told you before, yes.
You'll be 100 per cent safe.

24:09.920 --> 24:13.320
Marwan, they have to believe I'm dead.

24:13.400 --> 24:16.320
They will. My people have taken care of this.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.480
They better,

24:18.560 --> 24:22.040
cos once this is done,
the entire world is gonna be looking for me.

24:38.680 --> 24:42.600
Recovery teams aren't gonna
be allowed in there for a few weeks.

24:42.680 --> 24:45.680
- I understand.
- "Would you pass along our condolences?"

24:45.760 --> 24:47.880
- I'll tell him.
- "Sorry we couldn't help."

24:47.960 --> 24:49.960
Thanks, Ruben.

24:54.520 --> 24:56.600
- Edgar.
- Yeah?

24:56.680 --> 25:01.200
I have some bad news. Do you want me
to tell you here or somewhere private?

25:01.280 --> 25:02.400
What?

25:02.480 --> 25:06.360
Ruben Weiss from OSHA said they're not
gonna be able to get into the area

25:06.440 --> 25:09.200
where your mother died
for a few weeks or months.

25:09.280 --> 25:11.440
- Why not?
- Think about it.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.480
Half-life? Radiation?

25:13.560 --> 25:16.360
- What does that mean?
- Well, he didn't spell it out,

25:16.440 --> 25:21.280
but I think that means you're gonna have
to have your funeral without the body.

25:21.880 --> 25:24.960
- Of your mother.
- I can't deal with this right now, Chloe.

25:25.040 --> 25:28.680
Michelle needs a prioritised list
for Marwan's pursuit plan.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.200
Oh.

25:30.280 --> 25:32.680
OK, good.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.080
- Do you want me to do that for you?
- No.

26:06.080 --> 26:10.600
LAPD's locked down the area where Marwan
was last seen. Review the search grid.

26:10.680 --> 26:12.440
- All right.
- Thanks.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.600
Michelle.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.600
- When were you planning on telling me?
- About what?

26:20.680 --> 26:23.360
" About you and Buchanan.

26:24.160 --> 26:27.200
Never, because it's none of your business.

26:27.280 --> 26:28.440
Michelle.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.800
Before you worked with him at Division,
you worked with him in Seattle.

26:33.880 --> 26:36.880
- Yeah.
- We were still married then.

26:37.720 --> 26:39.800
Legally, yes.

26:39.880 --> 26:43.320
Did you sleep with him
while we were married?

26:43.400 --> 26:45.120
No.

26:45.200 --> 26:48.080
- I didn't.
- But you are now.

26:49.160 --> 26:52.400
Like I said, it's none of your business.

26:55.080 --> 26:59.360
- Edgar, where are those updates?
- Coming right up.

27:11.480 --> 27:14.160
Edgar, what are you doing?

27:22.240 --> 27:24.320
- Ms Dessler. What?
- Edgar, wait.

27:24.400 --> 27:29.560
Wait. I made a mistake. I used row-major
format instead of column-major.

27:29.640 --> 27:33.680
Why would you do that, Chloe? Row-major
isn't compatible with our software.

27:33.760 --> 27:37.760
- It'll bring all our processors to a crawl.
- I know. It was a mistake.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.920
Well, fix it.

27:43.240 --> 27:46.600
- Chloe, why did you cover for me?
- You're welcome.

27:46.680 --> 27:49.480
You'd have your job back
if I'd handed her that disk.

27:49.560 --> 27:52.440
I thought you had a lot on your mind.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.800
- Agent Bauer?
- Yeah.

28:50.520 --> 28:53.320
I checked with the neighbours.
Nobody's seen him.

28:53.400 --> 28:59.120
- Did you talk to the manager?
- He kept to himself, paid his rent on time.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.240
OK, thanks.

29:01.320 --> 29:03.400
- Agent Drake?
- Yes.

29:03.480 --> 29:07.800
Anderson was ex-military.
This bag is from Vanguard Mills.

29:07.880 --> 29:12.560
They make medals for the armed forces.
There's a date stamp on it, three months old.

29:12.640 --> 29:16.960
- Anderson left the military four years ago.
- You think he's posing as military?

29:17.040 --> 29:20.640
There's a possibility.
Let your people know. We'll do the same.

29:20.720 --> 29:25.200
- Have this scanned. Send it over to Chloe.
- You got it.

29:34.920 --> 29:40.820
This is Special Agent Drake. Can you put me
through to Dawson, please? Thank you.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.480
- "CTU, Almeida."
- Tony, it's Jack.

29:53.560 --> 29:58.720
Anderson might be posing as military. Update
the profile and see if anything comes back.

29:58.800 --> 30:01.920
- All right, I'm on it.
- OK, thanks.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.240
Yeah, this is Drake.
Listen, we just found credible evidence

30:05.320 --> 30:08.480
suggesting that Anderson
is disguised as military.

30:08.560 --> 30:10.960
That's right. Yes.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.800
Fine.

30:21.240 --> 30:23.040
Yes.

30:26.040 --> 30:28.280
No, that's not a problem.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.560
Good. All right, well, thanks.

30:30.640 --> 30:34.200
I'll let you know if we find anything else.

30:35.400 --> 30:36.640
" Hey.

30:36.720 --> 30:42.620
I found something. It's an external hard drive.
This is exactly what we're looking for.

30:43.520 --> 30:46.240
That's good work.

31:31.080 --> 31:32.640
Drop the weapon!

32:03.760 --> 32:06.040
Son of a bitch.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.760
Come on.

32:29.240 --> 32:32.560
Edgar Stiles.

32:32.640 --> 32:36.320
- It's Jack. Where's Chloe?
- She's busy doing a systems update.

32:36.400 --> 32:42.040
Tell Michelle and Tony that the FBI agent was
an impostor working for Marwan. I killed her.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.920
She took out my backup.
CTU needs to send out a team,

32:45.000 --> 32:47.480
lock down the apartment and investigate.

32:47.560 --> 32:51.680
- Do you wanna tell 'em yourself?
- No. Help me pull some data off a hard drive.

32:51.760 --> 32:56.120
The directory's locked. Hold on one second.
I'm gonna put you on speakerphone.

32:56.200 --> 32:58.320
- "Go ahead."
- Can you get into the root?

32:58.400 --> 33:04.280
- Yeah, but I can't open the files.
- Hold down tab arrow until the code appears.

33:06.200 --> 33:07.300
OK.

33:07.360 --> 33:10.240
What are the last three digits
on the part code?

33:10.320 --> 33:11.840
R-2-5.

33:11.920 --> 33:17.820
Escape out and enter pass code C-T-l-S-8-3-R.
That should backdoor you into the files.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.560
Oh, my God.

33:32.440 --> 33:36.000
- Jack, did it work?
- I'm in. I need to speak to Michelle now!

33:36.080 --> 33:40.520
- Hold on, I'll get 'em. Jack's on the line.
- Jack, what is it?

33:40.600 --> 33:43.960
I pulled some data off a hard drive
in Anderson's apartment.

33:44.040 --> 33:48.240
On it is a flight simulator and full schematics
to an F117 A Stealth fighter.

33:48.320 --> 33:52.880
- Anderson's an experienced pilot.
- I know. I also think he's posing as military.

33:52.960 --> 33:56.520
I believe Mitch Anderson's
trying to steal a Stealth fighter.

34:09.040 --> 34:11.960
- Almeida.
- Have you got anything from the air force?

34:12.040 --> 34:14.760
Hang on, it's coming through.

34:14.840 --> 34:20.040
An F117 A Stealth fighter took off on
a scheduled mission about 40 minutes ago.

34:20.120 --> 34:22.159
The pilot did not call in on schedule.

34:22.239 --> 34:26.440
That was about six minutes ago.
All attempts to contact that pilot have failed.

34:26.520 --> 34:29.440
OK. We have to assume
Anderson's flying that plane.

34:29.520 --> 34:31.560
- I agree.
- Is the aircraft armed?

34:31.639 --> 34:36.360
- Yeah, standard non-nuclear ordinance.
- We need a list of obvious possible targets.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.400
Yeah, right. I'm working that up right now.

34:39.480 --> 34:40.760
Wait.

34:40.840 --> 34:43.280
Air Force One is headed to LA.

34:43.360 --> 34:47.040
- Jack, did you hear that?
- Yeah. What's the ETA?

34:49.400 --> 34:52.000
11pm.

34:52.080 --> 34:55.320
Oh, my God.
They're going after the president.

34:55.400 --> 34:58.200
- I'll call Air Force One.
- We don't have a lot of time.

34:58.280 --> 35:03.160
Get me the recall frequency for that squadron
and send Anderson's bio over to my screen.

35:03.240 --> 35:05.240
- I'm on it.
- Where's Buchanan?

35:05.320 --> 35:09.000
- He's in tactical.
- He has to tell the Joint Chiefs of Staff

35:09.080 --> 35:13.080
that we believe the likely target
is President Keeler aboard Air Force One.

35:14.440 --> 35:20.340
You really have been helpful, Kevin.
I think this speech strikes just the right note.

35:20.840 --> 35:23.600
I'm sorry to interrupt. It's Dessler at CTU.

35:23.680 --> 35:28.440
- She says it's urgent.
- Yes, what is it, Ms Dessler?

35:28.520 --> 35:33.920
Mr President, we have reason to believe that
a Stealth fighter has been stolen by a terrorist,

35:34.000 --> 35:36.120
and is in your airspace as we speak.

35:36.200 --> 35:41.520
This plane is due to land. I'm about to address
the country. Just how sure are we about this?

35:41.600 --> 35:43.520
It's a near certainty.

35:43.600 --> 35:48.000
Your pilot is preparing to combine
evasive action with immediate descent.

35:48.080 --> 35:50.520
You're cleared to land in Palm Springs.

35:50.600 --> 35:54.240
I'm sure my escort fighters
are capable of protecting Air Force One.

35:54.320 --> 35:58.360
Mr President, this is a Stealth aircraft,
invisible to radar.

35:58.440 --> 36:02.160
If he finds you, he may be on you
before your fighter escort can react.

36:02.240 --> 36:05.280
- What are the chances he'll find us?
- I can't be sure,

36:05.360 --> 36:10.920
but the radar signature of a 747
and four fighter planes is unmistakeable.

36:11.000 --> 36:15.720
You're telling me that this stolen Stealth
plane will attempt to shoot me down?

36:15.800 --> 36:18.920
It looks that way, Mr President.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.200
I see.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.160
Dad?

36:23.920 --> 36:25.760
It's gonna be OK.

36:25.840 --> 36:29.440
Our plane may come under attack.
We're gonna take some precautions.

36:29.520 --> 36:33.640
- Get me the vice president on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

36:44.640 --> 36:47.400
All right.
It should be coming through right now.

36:47.480 --> 36:50.480
- Yeah, I got it.
- Not much to go on. Parents deceased.

36:50.560 --> 36:55.520
Has a sister named Alicia. It looks like
they lived together, so they might be close.

36:55.600 --> 36:58.360
- Any contact information?
- I can find that for you.

36:58.440 --> 37:01.880
- No time. Have you got the recall frequency?
- Yeah.

37:01.960 --> 37:06.640
- "Get ready to patch me through to Anderson."
- Copy that.

37:09.560 --> 37:12.080
Air Force One is descending
through 20,000ft.

37:12.160 --> 37:17.000
- The fighters have formed a protective shield.
- How long before it touches down?

37:17.080 --> 37:19.960
- Nine minutes.
- And no sign of the Stealth aircraft?

37:20.040 --> 37:23.040
- Not yet.
- Maybe it's not there.

37:23.120 --> 37:29.000
It's there. We just can't see it.
We're being beaten by our own technology.

37:29.080 --> 37:33.400
When you hit your intercom button,
you're patched through to the Stealth fighter.

37:33.480 --> 37:35.560
Copy that.

37:44.800 --> 37:48.120
Mitch Anderson, can you hear me?

37:48.200 --> 37:54.100
Captain Anderson, do you read me?
My name is Jack Bauer. I'm a federal agent.

37:54.640 --> 37:59.040
We know who you are,
we know what you're trying to do.

37:59.120 --> 38:01.520
Sir, I know you can hear me.

38:02.480 --> 38:06.120
Nothing you've done so far can't be undone.

38:06.200 --> 38:10.320
All you have to do is change your vector
to heading 115 southeast.

38:10.400 --> 38:14.760
That'll put you on a fast track to Edwards
Air Force Base. Once you touch down,

38:14.840 --> 38:19.800
then we can discuss how you wanna
handle this. Please just talk to me.

38:19.880 --> 38:25.000
Explain to me what you're trying to do,
what you're trying to accomplish.

38:25.080 --> 38:27.080
Why?

38:33.480 --> 38:37.360
I've been going over your service record.
It's very impressive.

38:37.440 --> 38:40.200
Graduated top of your class,
Air Force Academy.

38:40.280 --> 38:46.180
Highly decorated for your service in Desert
Storm including Air Force Silver Star.

38:46.440 --> 38:49.000
What happened to you?

38:49.080 --> 38:51.240
Explain it to me,

38:51.320 --> 38:57.220
because what you're trying to do right now,
I don't think that's who you are.

38:57.480 --> 39:01.320
I don't think that's how
you wanna be remembered.

39:02.560 --> 39:05.960
If I go down, you have to stay the course.
Do you understand?

39:06.040 --> 39:08.240
I'm sure it won't come to that.

39:08.320 --> 39:12.280
Charles, you're the vice president.
The nation will be relying on you.

39:12.360 --> 39:16.960
If the worst happens,
think of me as a casualty of war.

39:17.040 --> 39:21.320
Don't waste time,
just pick up the torch and move forward.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.640
Yes, sir, Mr President.

39:28.560 --> 39:32.280
We think CTU is in communication
with the pilot of the stolen aircraft.

39:32.360 --> 39:34.760
" Patch it through.

39:34.840 --> 39:39.000
I've just been notified by the FBI
that they've contacted your sister, Alicia.

39:39.080 --> 39:41.600
They've advised her of what's happening.

39:41.680 --> 39:44.680
She's scared.
She wants to talk to you.

39:46.200 --> 39:52.100
All you have to do, Captain Anderson, is
respond to me and I'll put her right through.

39:56.680 --> 39:59.080
Captain Anderson? Captain Anderson?

39:59.160 --> 40:01.760
We've been cut off.
Is there an override channel?

40:01.840 --> 40:05.080
He cut off all communication circuits.
We can't do anything.

40:05.160 --> 40:06.260
Dammit!

40:23.840 --> 40:25.080
Dad.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.480
I'm scared.

40:52.880 --> 40:53.980
Oh, my God.

41:01.840 --> 41:03.920
Was Air Force One just hit?

41:04.000 --> 41:06.560
Was Air Force One just hit?

41:08.680 --> 41:11.240
Escort pilots report...

41:11.320 --> 41:15.360
Air Force One has suffered an indirect hit
by an air-to-air missile.

41:16.960 --> 41:20.760
Pieces are falling to the ground
over the desert.

41:51.640 --> 41:54.800
