01:36.872 --> 01:39.472
LOOK, IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THIS,
IN TECH AND IN LIFE:

01:39.474 --> 01:42.244
IF YOU'RE NOT DISRUPTING,
YOU'RE NOT INNOVATING.

01:44.945 --> 01:47.413
YOU HAVEN'T SAID A WORD
IN TWO HOURS.

01:47.415 --> 01:49.748
OH, SORRY,
I WAS WATCHING SIMON LANG.

01:49.750 --> 01:51.416
- I...
- SIMON LANG?

01:51.418 --> 01:53.152
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA INTERACT
WITH REAL PEOPLE

01:53.154 --> 01:54.886
WHO ARE RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU?

01:54.888 --> 01:57.021
YOU KNOW, THE GREAT THING
ABOUT COLLEGE IS

01:57.023 --> 01:59.359
IT'S THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE
FRIENDSHIPS THAT LAST A LIFETIME.

02:01.161 --> 02:02.994
DO YOU KNOW WHO
YOUR ROOMMATE'S GONNA BE?

02:02.996 --> 02:05.896
A GUY NAMED LANCE BLACK.

02:05.898 --> 02:07.231
I BET HE'S LOVELY.

02:07.233 --> 02:09.900
DID YOU CALL
TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF?

02:09.901 --> 02:12.769
I DID, I DID.
I LEFT HIM A VOICEMAIL.

02:12.771 --> 02:16.039
- NEVER CALLED BACK.
- WELL, DID YOU SOUND LIKE A NERD?

02:16.041 --> 02:18.774
SORRY.
SOUNDED LIKE MYSELF.

02:18.776 --> 02:20.477
YEAH, THAT'S WHY
HE DIDN'T CALL BACK.

02:20.479 --> 02:23.445
OH, ASHLEY.
GUYS, PLEASE.

02:23.447 --> 02:25.316
- ENTREZ-NOUS.
- OKAY.

02:26.917 --> 02:27.984
HERE WE GO.

02:30.353 --> 02:32.120
OH, IT'S, UM...

02:32.122 --> 02:34.891
IT'S A LITTLE SMALLER
THAN IT LOOKED IN THE BROCHURE.

02:36.159 --> 02:37.392
I THINK IT'S BIG ENOUGH
FOR TWO PEOPLE.

02:37.394 --> 02:40.093
WHAT IF YOU WANT
TO HAVE FRIENDS OVER?

02:40.095 --> 02:43.497
LET'S GET REAL, MOM.
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

02:43.499 --> 02:46.433
JAMES, PLEASE DON'T LET THE
COMPUTER BE YOUR ONLY FRIEND.

02:46.435 --> 02:47.802
JAMES: IT'S NOT.

02:50.339 --> 02:51.473
IT'S HOPELESS.

02:53.775 --> 02:55.840
OKAY.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.376
ONE DAY,
I WILL CODE AN APP

02:57.378 --> 02:59.077
THAT WILL REALLY
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

02:59.079 --> 03:02.247
JAMES, I KNOW IT'S
NOT PRINCETON OR M.I.T.

03:02.249 --> 03:03.984
NO, MOM, DON'T DO THAT.
IT'S OKAY.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.252
I JUST REALLY HOPE

03:07.254 --> 03:09.187
MY ROOMMATE'S, LIKE,
AT LEAST A LITTLE SMART.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.922
MOM, LET'S GO.

03:11.924 --> 03:14.258
I'VE GOT A PARTY
TO GET TO TONIGHT.

03:14.260 --> 03:17.161
OKAY.
AAH.

03:17.163 --> 03:19.263
THIS IS WHERE I LEAVE YOU.

03:19.265 --> 03:21.498
OOH, I LOVE YOU,
I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.369
OKAY, JAMES... HAVE FUN.

03:25.904 --> 03:28.104
- BYE, JAMES.
- BYE, JAMES.

03:28.106 --> 03:30.139
BE GOOD.
NO, DON'T BE GOOD.

03:30.141 --> 03:32.140
BE ROTTEN,
BUT EAT GOOD,

03:32.142 --> 03:35.944
- AND HAVE FUN, AND...
- MOM, LET'S GO.

03:35.946 --> 03:37.847
I'M SURE YOUR ROOMMATE
WILL BE LOVELY.

04:06.073 --> 04:07.074
JAMES: OH.

04:08.442 --> 04:11.143
HI.
YOU MUST BE LANCE.

04:11.145 --> 04:16.615
YEAH. YOU MUST BE MY SOON-TO-BE-TRANSFERRED-
TO-ANOTHER-COLLEGE ROOMMATE.

04:16.617 --> 04:18.583
OH, OKAY.
UM...

04:18.584 --> 04:20.184
SO THIS IS YOUR SIDE
OF THE ROOM.

04:20.185 --> 04:22.320
I HAVE LEFT IT
COMPLETELY UNTOUCHED.

04:22.322 --> 04:24.087
DO YOU NEED HELP
BRINGING ANYTHING IN?

04:24.089 --> 04:26.358
NO, I GOT IT COVERED.
THANKS, THOUGH.

04:27.860 --> 04:29.361
HEY, DO YOU WANT TO GRAB
SOMETHING TO EAT?

04:30.862 --> 04:32.895
ACTUALLY, YEAH,
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I DO.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.230
- YEAH.
- OKAY, COOL.

04:34.232 --> 04:35.865
I'LL SEE YOU, MAN.

04:35.867 --> 04:37.634
UH, OKAY, NO, YEAH.

04:37.636 --> 04:39.568
THAT'S... THAT'S COOL.
I HAVE SOMETHING TO DO.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.404
I WAS GONNA FINISH UP
ON SOME WORK THAT I WAS DOING,

04:41.406 --> 04:44.640
SO MAYBE WE COULD CHAT ABOUT IT
LATER OVER SOME CHAI TEA,

04:44.642 --> 04:47.177
OR... OKAY.

04:56.486 --> 04:59.286
HERE YOU GO, MAN.
HAVE A NICE NIGHT.

04:59.288 --> 05:01.457
WOMAN: ORDER NUMBER SEVEN
IS READY!

05:08.897 --> 05:10.832
GOD, I JUST WANT TO KISS YOU.

05:12.634 --> 05:14.300
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME.

05:14.302 --> 05:16.001
OH, IT'S... UH, IT'S ROB.

05:16.003 --> 05:19.571
ROB.
WHAT'S YOUR LAST NAME, ROB?

05:19.573 --> 05:22.507
WHY DO YOU
NEED SO MUCH INFORMATION?

05:22.509 --> 05:25.410
YOUR LAST NAME IS
"SO MUCH INFORMATION"?

05:25.412 --> 05:27.446
WELL, YEAH.

05:27.448 --> 05:29.882
LOOK, YOU SEE THIS?

05:30.683 --> 05:32.116
WHAT? IT'S A PHONE.

05:32.118 --> 05:33.451
NO, NO, NO,
IT'S NOT A PHONE.

05:33.453 --> 05:36.953
THIS IS A 24/7 PORTAL
TO ALL THE SEX THAT

05:36.955 --> 05:39.489
I COULD EVER DREAM ABOUT.

05:39.491 --> 05:41.224
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS CLICK.

05:41.226 --> 05:42.692
SO...?

05:42.694 --> 05:46.363
SO, I MEAN,
YOU'RE OBSOLETE.

05:46.365 --> 05:49.599
OKAY, LIKE, I'M NOT GONNA TELL
YOU WHAT MY LAST NAME IS,

05:49.601 --> 05:51.400
AND I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU
WHERE I'M FROM

05:51.402 --> 05:54.470
OR WHERE I GO TO SCHOOL
OR WHAT I DO AT SCHOOL, OKAY?

05:54.472 --> 05:57.038
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THE BEST PART IS?

05:57.040 --> 05:59.409
I DON'T HAVE TO, OKAY?

06:02.345 --> 06:04.645
HEY, HEY, WESLEY, MAN.
WAIT UP, MAN.

06:04.647 --> 06:06.381
WESLEY.

06:06.383 --> 06:07.582
HE WAS CUTE.

06:07.584 --> 06:10.317
- I GUESS.
- WHY'D HE LEAVE?

06:10.319 --> 06:12.652
HE WOULDN'T EVEN TELL ME
HIS LAST NAME.

06:12.654 --> 06:14.521
SO?

06:14.523 --> 06:15.988
SO I'M GOING HOME.

06:15.990 --> 06:17.324
HEY, WAIT.

06:17.326 --> 06:19.293
MIND IF I HOOK UP WITH HIM?

06:20.228 --> 06:21.529
WHATEVER, RACHEL.

06:23.398 --> 06:25.698
HEY, WAIT UP.
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR NAME IS,

06:25.700 --> 06:27.468
FIRST OR LAST.

06:29.604 --> 06:30.605
HANNAH?

06:32.172 --> 06:35.573
- YOU GO TO SCHOOL HERE?
- YEP.

06:35.575 --> 06:38.710
- ME, TOO.
- OKAY, COOL.

06:38.712 --> 06:40.445
I MEAN, I HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU SINCE...

06:40.447 --> 06:43.013
SINCE PROM NIGHT IN MAY.

06:43.015 --> 06:45.048
YEAH, JAMES, LET'S PLEASE
NOT TALK ABOUT IT.

06:45.050 --> 06:47.317
LOOK, I WAS JUST
TRYING TO IMPRESS YOU.

06:47.319 --> 06:50.454
- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT.
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID SO WRONG.

06:50.456 --> 06:53.122
I MEAN, I...
WAS MY VOICE THAT BAD?

06:53.124 --> 06:55.591
NO, YOUR VOICE WAS GREAT.

06:55.593 --> 06:58.261
THEN WHAT DID I DO WRONG?

06:58.263 --> 07:00.061
JAMES.

07:00.063 --> 07:02.498
YOU KNOW HOW SHY I AM.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.366
WHEN YOU PICKED UP
THAT MICROPHONE

07:04.368 --> 07:06.568
AND ANNOUNCED MY NAME IN FRONT
OF A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE,

07:06.570 --> 07:09.504
400 PAIRS OF EYES
TURNED TO FACE ME.

07:09.506 --> 07:12.607
I WAS MORTIFIED.
I UNDERSTAND

07:12.609 --> 07:15.609
THAT YOU WANTED TO EXPRESS
YOUR FEELINGS TO ME,

07:15.611 --> 07:18.746
BUT THERE'S A WAY BETTER WAY OF
DOING THAT THAN HUMILIATING ME.

07:18.748 --> 07:22.348
HANNAH, I'M REALLY SORRY.
SERIOUSLY, MY INTENTIONS

07:22.350 --> 07:24.217
WERE THE EXACT OPPOSITE
OF THE RESULTS,

07:24.219 --> 07:26.352
AND I WAS JUST TRYING
TO SHOW YOU THAT I LIKED YOU

07:26.354 --> 07:28.388
BEFORE WE GRADUATED
AND WENT OFF TO COLLEGE,

07:28.390 --> 07:32.559
AND I TRIED FOR FOUR YEARS
AND NOTHING WORKED.

07:32.561 --> 07:37.129
PLEASE JUST WALK ME TO MY DORM
AND THEN LEAVE ME ALONE.

07:37.131 --> 07:38.730
I'M JUST NEVER
GONNA SING AGAIN.

07:38.732 --> 07:40.399
NO, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT,

07:40.401 --> 07:42.668
AND YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT FOR ME.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.670
I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR YOU,
HANNAH.

07:44.672 --> 07:49.042
THEN PLEASE, LEAVE ME ALONE IN
MY QUIET SPACE WITH MY BOOKS.

07:53.312 --> 07:55.145
IF YOU WANT TO READ,
I'LL WATCH THE GROUND

07:55.147 --> 07:57.481
SO YOU DON'T TRIP
ON ANYTHING ELSE.

07:57.483 --> 07:58.484
OKAY.

07:59.785 --> 08:01.785
AT LEAST TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE READING.

08:01.787 --> 08:04.690
- "SENSE AND SENSIBILITY" BY JANE AUSTEN.
- JANE AUSTEN.

08:05.791 --> 08:07.690
HAVE YOU READ HER WORK?

08:07.692 --> 08:10.226
I LOVE JANE AUSTEN, YEAH.

08:10.228 --> 08:13.496
- ME, TOO.
- WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE PART ABOUT HER?

08:13.498 --> 08:17.232
SHE WRITES COMPLEX,
STRONG FEMALE CHARACTERS.

08:17.234 --> 08:19.667
HER CHARACTERS
ARE SO EXTRAVAGANT.

08:19.669 --> 08:23.505
THEIR NAMES ARE SO PRECISE,
KINDA LIKE IP ADDRESSES.

08:23.507 --> 08:28.043
YEAH, I MEAN, YOU CAN TELL SO MUCH
ABOUT A PERSON BY THEIR NAME.

08:40.221 --> 08:41.222
WELL...

08:45.693 --> 08:50.328
HEY, UM,
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT...

08:50.330 --> 08:52.533
THERE'S A CHASM BETWEEN
MY INTENTIONS AND MY RESULTS.

08:56.102 --> 08:58.337
I KNOW
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

08:59.505 --> 09:00.839
I'LL SEE YOU IN CS.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.774
- ELEVATOR: FLOOR NUMBER FIVE.
- YES, YEAH.

09:03.776 --> 09:06.244
- I'LL SEE YOU AS WELL.
- ELEVATOR: GOING UP.

09:15.654 --> 09:17.720
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! JUST

09:17.722 --> 09:19.254
I GOT COMPANY.

09:19.256 --> 09:20.890
WHAT? WHY?
WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO SLEEP?

09:20.892 --> 09:24.259
NOT HERE.

09:24.261 --> 09:27.863
JUST FIGURE IT OUT, MAN.

09:27.865 --> 09:31.165
YEAH, JUST ATE DINNER,
TUCKED IN FOR BED NOW.

09:32.535 --> 09:35.303
REALLY COMFORTABLE, ACTUALLY.

UH, YEAH,

09:36.739 --> 09:39.372
THEY'RE REALLY SOFT.

09:39.374 --> 09:40.710
USING THEM A LOT.

09:42.411 --> 09:44.344
LANCE SEEMS...

09:44.346 --> 09:46.145
PRETTY ACCEPTING OF ME.

10:04.197 --> 10:05.396

VIA WINDOW.

10:19.845 --> 10:21.344

10:21.346 --> 10:22.545

12:17.919 --> 12:19.784

12:34.633 --> 12:36.700
THAT, MY FRIEND, PUTS YOU ON
THE FAST TRACK TO GETTING AN A,

12:36.702 --> 12:37.903
OKAY?

12:42.674 --> 12:45.942
UH...

12:45.944 --> 12:50.712
ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T DO IT,
IT WAS A DIFFERENT ONE.

12:50.714 --> 12:52.681
I DIDN'T COMPLETE IT AT ALL,
ACTUALLY.

12:52.683 --> 12:54.583
UH-HUH.

12:54.585 --> 12:57.085
GOD, I MISS NEW HAVEN.

12:57.087 --> 12:58.787
LISTEN...

12:58.789 --> 13:02.723
...THIS CLASS IS YOUR DOORWAY
TO EVERY OTHER

13:02.725 --> 13:06.660
COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSE
IN THIS ENTIRE COLLEGE.

13:06.662 --> 13:08.763
IT IS A REQUIREMENT
THAT I MAKE IT TOUGH.

13:08.765 --> 13:10.597
WHY IS THAT A REQUIREMENT?

13:10.599 --> 13:12.365
TO WEED OUT THE UNWORTHY.

13:12.367 --> 13:14.567
THE CODING FIELD IS OVERCROWDED
WITH DABBLERS,

13:14.569 --> 13:16.836
AND I FOR ONE...
EXCUSE ME, TAKE THOSE OFF!

13:16.838 --> 13:18.838
THANK YOU.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.340
AND STOP LOOKING
AT YOUR NAILS, THANK YOU.

13:21.342 --> 13:24.510
SO, IF YOU WANT TO TAKE ANY
OTHER COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES

13:24.512 --> 13:25.811
AT THIS COLLEGE, OR YOU WANT
A CAREER IN IT,

13:25.813 --> 13:27.513
YOU HAVE TO TAKE MY CLASS,

13:27.515 --> 13:31.516
AND IN ORDER TO PASS MY CLASS,
YOU HAVE TO WORK...

13:31.518 --> 13:33.551
VERY HARD.

13:33.553 --> 13:35.288
CLASS DISMISSED.

13:47.866 --> 13:49.868
- WHAT'S UP?
- HEY, SQUARE.

13:51.502 --> 13:53.036
LISTEN,
ME AND THE OTHER STUDENTS,

13:53.038 --> 13:55.771
WE KINDA... WE'VE COME UP
WITH A PLAN.

13:55.773 --> 13:56.906
FOR WHAT?

13:56.908 --> 13:59.508
TO PASS CS.

13:59.510 --> 14:01.110
UH, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

14:01.112 --> 14:05.080
BRO, ARE YOU GONNA
SLEEP WITH PROFESSOR BARNES?

14:05.082 --> 14:06.514
- NO, I'M NOT GONNA SLEEP WITH PROFESSOR BARNES.
- THAT'S GNARLY.

14:06.516 --> 14:08.483
DON'T DO IT.

14:08.485 --> 14:11.052
SHE WOULD PROBABLY FALL INTO A
DEPRESSION, EVEN THOUGH SHE DIGS ME.

14:11.054 --> 14:12.987
THE THING IS I WOULD GET
EXPELLED AND WE DON'T WANT THAT,

14:12.989 --> 14:15.489
SO WE HAVE TO DO THIS
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

14:15.491 --> 14:16.723
HERE'S WHAT I'M THINKING,

14:16.725 --> 14:20.093
SHE CAN'T FAIL ALL OF US
AT ONCE, OKAY?

14:20.095 --> 14:23.396
SO WE EITHER SINK TOGETHER
OR WE DROWN TOGETHER.

14:23.398 --> 14:25.498
ISN'T THAT THE SAME THING?
I THINK IT'S THE SAME THING.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.699
YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S THE POINT.

14:26.701 --> 14:28.501
I... I KNOW.

14:28.503 --> 14:31.070
I'M GONNA TELL YOU IF
AND WHEN WE DO THE ASSIGNMENTS,

14:31.072 --> 14:32.138
OKAY?

14:32.140 --> 14:33.538
HOW ARE YOU GONNA LEARN?

14:33.540 --> 14:36.608
WHAT?

14:36.610 --> 14:39.044
HOW ARE WE GONNA LEARN?
BRO, WE DON'T WANNA LEARN.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.412
WE JUST WANNA PASS
THE CS REQUIREMENTS.

14:41.414 --> 14:44.049
NO, SPEAK FOR YOURSELF,
WESLEY.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.417
SORRY, I HATE HIM.
I WANT TO LEARN.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.054
SEE, HE WANTS TO LEARN.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.590
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE PLAN
OR NOT?

14:52.592 --> 14:55.792
- HE WANTS TO...
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?

14:55.794 --> 15:00.163
- I UNDERSTAND.
- GOOD.

15:00.165 --> 15:01.965
WE'LL BE IN CONTACT.

15:01.967 --> 15:05.134
TILL THEN, DO YOU,
BOO-BOO.

15:05.136 --> 15:06.635
COME ON GUYS, LET'S GO.

15:06.637 --> 15:08.570
- SEE YOU LATER, ALLIGATOR.
- OKAY, OKAY.

15:08.572 --> 15:09.838
- REMEMBER THAT.
- LOVE YOU.

15:09.840 --> 15:11.607
WHAT?

15:11.609 --> 15:14.776
ALL RIGHT, NOW GUYS, WHAT
DATING APP WOULD YOU RECOMMEND?

15:14.778 --> 15:16.444
NONE OF 'EM, MAN,
DATING IS FOR PUTZES.

15:16.446 --> 15:18.146
WHY WOULD I WASTE MY MONEY
ON A MOVIE?

15:18.148 --> 15:20.648
- OR DINNER?
- OR FLOWERS?

15:20.650 --> 15:22.550
YOU KNOW, I NEVER
GAVE A GIRL FLOWERS.

15:22.552 --> 15:25.086
HEY, DON'T DISS FLOWERS,
MY DAD GIVES MY MOM FLOWERS

15:25.088 --> 15:26.653
ALL THE TIME AND IT
ALWAYS MAKES HER HAPPY.

15:26.655 --> 15:27.955
THAT WENT OUT
WITH THE 20TH CENTURY.

15:27.957 --> 15:29.123
I'M GONNA
FALL.

15:29.125 --> 15:30.624
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME
AND MONEY.

15:30.626 --> 15:32.092
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S A NUMBERS GAME.

15:32.094 --> 15:35.862
SEE, THE MARKET IS SATURATED
IN SINGLE, SLUTTY GIRLS,

15:35.864 --> 15:37.898
AND IT'S A BUYER'S MARKET.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.632
HEY, LANCE, DO YOU HAVE
A MINUTE?

15:39.634 --> 15:41.100
ACTUALLY NO, WE'RE IN
A BOARD MEETING,

15:41.102 --> 15:45.503
- IT'S KINDA PRIVATE.
- OH, YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME?

15:45.505 --> 15:47.106
WELL, DO I KNOW YOU?

15:47.108 --> 15:50.541
UH, YEAH,
WE SLEPT TOGETHER.

15:50.543 --> 15:53.177
- UM...
- YOU NEVER CALLED.

15:53.179 --> 15:55.747
I WILL CALL YOU.

15:55.749 --> 15:57.514
I PROMISE, I WILL CALL YOU.

15:57.516 --> 15:59.850
OKAY?

15:59.852 --> 16:00.918
BYE.

16:00.920 --> 16:04.821
HE IS NOT GONNA CALL YOU.

16:04.823 --> 16:07.090
SO WHAT WOULD YOU GUYS SAY
IS THE BEST HOOK-UP APP?

16:07.092 --> 16:09.659
UM...

16:09.661 --> 16:12.195
WELL, I GUESS THE PERFECT APP
HASN'T EVEN BEEN CREATED YET.

16:12.197 --> 16:14.630
- WHOA.
- HELLO.

16:14.632 --> 16:17.499
YEAH, BUT WHAT FEATURES
DO YOU THINK WE NEED?

16:17.501 --> 16:20.269
YOU KNOW, IT WOULD HAVE
A GIRL AIRLIFTED OUT OF MY BED

16:20.271 --> 16:22.238
- THE SECOND I'M FINISHED WITH HER.
- OOH!

16:22.240 --> 16:25.840
YIKES, I DON'T THINK TELEPORTATION
EXISTS YET, LANCE, SO...

16:25.842 --> 16:27.842
I WAS BEING THEORETICAL.

16:27.844 --> 16:29.510
YEAH, THEORETICAL.

16:29.512 --> 16:32.613
YOU KNOW, IT WOULD HAVE TO
MAKE SURE THAT A GIRL

16:32.615 --> 16:34.648
COULDN'T FIND ME AFTER,
YOU KNOW?

16:34.650 --> 16:35.983
OR EVEN IF
SHE WANTED TO FIND ME

16:35.985 --> 16:38.518
SHE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
BECAUSE THE INFORMATION

16:38.520 --> 16:41.088
WOULD GET LOST OR MAYBE
IT WOULD JUST MORPH MY ACCOUNT

16:41.090 --> 16:42.789
INTO SOME OTHER ACCOUNT.

16:42.791 --> 16:44.557
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, NO, NO,
I GET WHAT YOU MEAN,

16:44.559 --> 16:47.560
LIKE, YOU COULD MIX UP
OUR IDENTITY OR SOMETHING.

16:47.562 --> 16:50.096
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY MUCH EXACTLY
WHAT I JUST SAID.

16:50.098 --> 16:52.265
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

16:52.267 --> 16:54.766
WHY DON'T WE JUST CREATE
AN APP LIKE THAT.

16:54.768 --> 16:58.236
OH, YOU KNOW HOW TO CODE?

16:58.238 --> 17:00.538
BUT WE'RE TAKING A COMPUTER
SCIENCE CLASS,

17:00.540 --> 17:02.040
WE CAN LEARN.

17:02.042 --> 17:04.642
NO, WE CAN'T. NOT TO DO
SOMETHING THAT SOPHISTICATED.

17:04.644 --> 17:06.042
WE DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND
THE BOOK.

17:06.045 --> 17:08.948
YEAH, WE CAN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND
THE SYLLABUS.

17:14.618 --> 17:16.319
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

17:16.321 --> 17:18.154
DISRUPTION IS NOT AN APP.

17:18.156 --> 17:20.056
DISRUPTION IS NOT GADGET.

17:20.058 --> 17:22.624
DISRUPTION IS NOT
A BUSINESS MODEL.

17:22.626 --> 17:26.895
DISRUPTION IS CATACLYSMIC CHANGE
IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR

17:26.896 --> 17:29.231
BROUGHT ON BY CONSENSUS.

17:29.233 --> 17:31.233
I'M NOT DOING THE HOMEWORK,
I'M JUST READING THE BOOK.

17:31.235 --> 17:32.968
YOU DIDN'T SAY I COULDN'T
READ THE BOOK, IS THAT OKAY?

17:32.970 --> 17:36.037
RELAX.
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE BOOK?

17:36.039 --> 17:38.006
IT'S ON THE SYLLABUS.

17:38.008 --> 17:40.241
IT'S "PROGRAMMING SOCIAL
ENGAGEMENT PLATFORMS."

17:40.243 --> 17:42.110
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

17:42.112 --> 17:43.910
- YOU'RE KIDDING.
- I NEVER KID.

17:43.912 --> 17:45.746
WELL, I THINK THAT MIGHT
BE A PROBLEM, JAMES.

17:45.748 --> 17:47.281
- HEY, THAT'S MINE.
- WELL, IT'S A NICE PHONE CASE.

17:47.283 --> 17:49.583
- THANK YOU.
- IT'S BIRDS.

17:49.585 --> 17:51.885
- MM-HMM.
- IS THE BOOK HARD?

17:51.887 --> 17:52.886
I'VE READ IT BEFORE.

17:52.888 --> 17:53.987
I MEAN THE ORIGINAL EDITION.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.755
WHAT, IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS?

17:55.757 --> 17:57.226
NO, WHEN I WAS
IN SIXTH GRADE.

17:59.127 --> 18:01.260
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN CODING FOR?

18:01.262 --> 18:05.697
- SINCE I WAS SEVEN.
- HMM.

18:05.699 --> 18:06.698
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:06.700 --> 18:08.767
OH, YOU'VE BEEN PROMOTED.

18:08.769 --> 18:10.869
YOU'RE INVITED
TO MY BOARD MEETING.

18:10.871 --> 18:12.072
COME ON, GRAB YOUR STUFF.

18:17.109 --> 18:19.344
GRAB A CHAIR.

18:19.346 --> 18:21.045
WHOA, OKAY.

18:21.047 --> 18:24.614
ALL RIGHT, UH, DANIEL, WESLEY,
YOU REMEMBER JAMES.

18:24.616 --> 18:26.383
JAMES, THIS IS DANIEL
AND WESLEY.

18:26.385 --> 18:27.984
- WHAT'S UP?
- HOW'S IT GOING, BUDDY?

18:27.986 --> 18:29.886
OKAY, IF THIS IS
ABOUT COMPUTER SCIENCE,

18:29.888 --> 18:31.621
I'M JUST GONNA SAY,

18:31.623 --> 18:33.990
MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL DO
THE HOMEWORK, I'M JUST SAYING.

18:33.992 --> 18:36.725
UH, YOU HAVEN'T QUITE GOTTEN
TO VOTING STATUS YET,

18:36.727 --> 18:40.396
SO FOR RIGHT NOW
YOU'RE JUST CONSULTANT, OKAY?

18:40.398 --> 18:41.897
OF COURSE, YEAH.

18:41.899 --> 18:43.665
- SO, I HAVE AN IDEA.
- WHOA!

18:43.667 --> 18:45.033
- HEY.
- WE HAVE AN IDEA,

18:45.035 --> 18:47.802
AND WE WOULD LIKE
TO HIRE YOU.

18:47.804 --> 18:50.137
TO DO WHAT?

18:50.139 --> 18:51.338
TO BUILD AN APP.

18:51.340 --> 18:52.973
WE NEED TO INTERVIEW HIM
FIRST

18:52.975 --> 18:54.707
BEFORE WE GIVE HIM ANY JOB.

18:54.709 --> 18:56.243
TRUE, TRUE.

18:56.245 --> 18:57.911
HAVE YOU EVER BUILT
AN APP BEFORE?

18:57.913 --> 18:59.079
YES.

18:59.081 --> 19:00.713
OKAY, WELL,
TELL US ABOUT IT.

19:00.715 --> 19:03.650
- WHICH ONE?
- WHOA, WHOA! WHICH ONE?

19:03.652 --> 19:05.151
LIKE THERE'S MULTIPLE APPS
THAT YOU'VE MADE?

19:05.153 --> 19:09.755
UH, WELL, YEAH,
I'VE BUILT 17 FOR IOS,

19:09.757 --> 19:11.156
AND 12 FOR ANDROID.

19:11.158 --> 19:13.125
OKAY, SO WHAT DO THEY DO?

19:13.127 --> 19:17.229
UH, OKAY, WELL, ONE OF THEM LEAD
HOMELESS PEOPLE TO SHELTERS,

19:17.231 --> 19:18.930
ANOTHER ONE ASSISTED
THE BLIND,

19:18.932 --> 19:21.333
UH, ONE PUBLIC
THOROUGH FARES,

19:21.335 --> 19:24.368
ANOTHER ONE HOSTED
LOCAL FOOD DRIVES, UM...

19:24.370 --> 19:27.171
OKAY, WELL, IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO
DO SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT.

19:27.173 --> 19:30.674
HEY, CAN YOU GUYS BELIEVE THAT
THIS GENIUS IS MY ROOMMATE?

19:30.676 --> 19:31.975
I MEAN, HOW PERFECT IS THAT?

19:31.977 --> 19:33.110
OOH-HOO-HOO-HOO!
THIS IS PERFECT.

19:33.112 --> 19:34.711
MM-HMM, I LOVE IT.

19:34.713 --> 19:38.348
JAMES, YOU ARE GOING TO BUILD
ONE MORE APP,

19:38.350 --> 19:41.184
AND THIS APP WILL TAKE
THE WORLD BY STORM.

19:41.186 --> 19:42.818
WELL, WHAT'S IT GONNA DO?

19:42.820 --> 19:43.819
JAMES, IT'S QUITE SIMPLE.

19:43.821 --> 19:45.321
WE TAKE MEN AND WOMEN

19:45.323 --> 19:47.755
AND WE PUT THEM TOGETHER
SO THEY CAN MEET UP.

19:47.757 --> 19:49.691
- SO, A DATING APP.
- NOT A DATING APP.

19:49.693 --> 19:51.793
HOOK-UPS.

19:51.795 --> 19:53.194
THERE'S ALREADY HOOK-UP APPS
OUT THERE.

19:53.196 --> 19:55.763
NO, BUT NOT LIKE THIS ONE.

19:55.765 --> 19:57.198
WHAT'S SO DIFFERENT
ABOUT THIS ONE?

19:57.200 --> 20:00.734
THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT TO BE
ON THIS APP,

20:00.736 --> 20:02.970
YOU HAVE TO AGREE TO CERTAIN
TERMS AND CONDITIONS

20:02.972 --> 20:04.805
THAT WILL MAKE SURE
THAT YOU, ONE,

20:04.807 --> 20:06.206
DO NOT ASK FOR NAMES,

20:06.208 --> 20:09.042
TWO, YOU WILL NOT ASK
TO SEE THE PERSON AGAIN,

20:09.044 --> 20:12.712
AND, THREE, BY NO MEANS,
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE,

20:12.714 --> 20:15.281
WILL YOU DATE
ANYBODY ON THE APP.

20:15.283 --> 20:17.083
AND THAT MEANS THAT ALL
THE GUYS ARE GONNA BE ON IT.

20:17.085 --> 20:18.484
AND ALL THE GIRLS ARE GONNA
HAVE TO BE ON IT

20:18.486 --> 20:21.887
IF THEY WANT TO BE WITH ANYONE.
MM-HMM.

20:21.889 --> 20:25.157
OKAY, WHAT'S SO WRONG
WITH A GIRL KNOWING YOUR NAME,

20:25.159 --> 20:26.158
OR EVEN WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE?

20:26.160 --> 20:28.393
WHAT'S SO BAD?

20:28.395 --> 20:29.827
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S
FOR ME TO KNOW

20:29.829 --> 20:31.697
AND YOU TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO CODE.

20:35.469 --> 20:38.135
DO YOU THINK...

20:38.137 --> 20:41.405
ALL THE GIRLS WILL BE
ON THE APP?

20:41.407 --> 20:44.040
OH, OKAY.
SO HE DOES LIKE GIRLS.

20:44.042 --> 20:45.442
PAY UP.

20:45.444 --> 20:46.776
DUDE, I'M NOT GAY.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.978
I DO... I LIKE ONE GIRL.

20:48.980 --> 20:50.213
I'M NOT SAYING WHO IT IS.

20:50.215 --> 20:53.116
STICK AROUND, OKAY?
LISTEN TO ME,

20:53.118 --> 20:57.920
AND SHE'LL BE EATING
OUT OF THE PALM OF YOUR HAND.

20:57.922 --> 20:59.888
WHOA, WHOA, JAMES, JAMES,
COME ON.

20:59.890 --> 21:01.423
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
COME BACK.

21:01.425 --> 21:02.725
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

21:05.195 --> 21:06.495
SO IT'S A MAYBE.

21:06.497 --> 21:09.363
OKAY, FINE, WELL,
YOU WON FAIR AND SQUARE.

21:09.365 --> 21:11.532
PAY UP.

21:11.534 --> 21:13.234
SO, HOW WAS THE HONEYMOON?

21:13.236 --> 21:15.436
IT WAS THE BEST ONE YET.

21:15.438 --> 21:17.471
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS,
JAMES.

21:17.473 --> 21:20.273
I TOLD HER,
"JUST BRING A PASSPORT."

21:20.275 --> 21:24.277
YOU KNOW, AN ANNUAL HONEYMOON
WOULD SAVE ANY MARRIAGE.

21:24.279 --> 21:26.779
I WISH YOU AND LEAH WOULD HAVE
TRIED IT, HONEY.

21:26.781 --> 21:29.915
THANKS FOR
THE EARLY WARNING, MOM.

21:29.917 --> 21:32.817
UH, JAMES, HAVE YOU
MET ANYONE YET?

21:32.819 --> 21:34.986
YEAH, I'VE MET A LOT
OF PEOPLE.

21:34.988 --> 21:36.422
ANY GIRLS?

21:36.424 --> 21:39.525
NO, DAD, I'M TRYING TO FOCUS
ON MY STUDIES.

21:39.527 --> 21:42.093
I'M GONNA ASK
FOR A PATERNITY TEST.

21:42.095 --> 21:44.529
HEY, I SHOULD ASK
FOR A PATERNITY TEST.

21:44.531 --> 21:47.197
- OUCH!
- VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE GARDENER.

21:47.199 --> 21:49.099
- OH, PHIL.
- DAD, I WAS ONLY KIDDING.

21:49.101 --> 21:50.801
ME TOO, ME TOO.

21:50.803 --> 21:54.870
JAMES, IF YOU WANT ANY
ADVICE ABOUT THE FAIRER SEX,

21:54.872 --> 21:56.973
YOU SHOULD ASK
YOUR GRANDFATHER.

21:56.975 --> 21:59.242
THEY DON'T ACT MUCH FAIRER.

21:59.244 --> 22:03.579
YOU'RE NOT BECOMING
AN ANTI-FEMINIST, ARE YOU JAMES?

22:03.581 --> 22:06.047
I DON'T KNOW GRANDPA, I'M
STILL STUDYING THE SITUATION.

22:06.049 --> 22:08.317
DAD, I DON'T THINK YOUR
ROMANTIC ADVICE PERTAINS

22:08.319 --> 22:09.851
TO JAMES' GENERATION.

22:09.853 --> 22:11.052
THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING
ON THEIR PHONE NOW.

22:11.054 --> 22:12.387
THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE.

22:12.389 --> 22:14.222
I MEAN, THAT'S HOW
THEY MEET EACH OTHER.

22:14.224 --> 22:16.824
AND HOOK-UP WITH EACH OTHER
AND BREAK-UP WITH EACH OTHER.

22:16.826 --> 22:18.859
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY,
WOMEN AND MEN

22:18.861 --> 22:20.995
HAVE NOT CHANGED
FOR 10,000 YEARS.

22:20.997 --> 22:23.097
PHIL...

22:23.099 --> 22:26.200
...I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THAT.

22:26.202 --> 22:28.103
HMM, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT.

22:43.617 --> 22:45.284
WHAT?
IS THE WELL DRY?

22:45.286 --> 22:48.553
NO, I JUST HAVE TO WAIT
FOR MY DAD'S CHECK TO CLEAR.

22:48.555 --> 22:50.087
YOU THINK ABOUT MY OFFER?

22:50.089 --> 22:51.322
- TO MAKE THE HOOK-UP APP?
- MM-HMM.

22:51.324 --> 22:53.057
YEAH, AND THE ANSWER IS NO,
OKAY?

22:53.059 --> 22:55.126
THAT'S THE LAST THING
THAT I WANT TO DO.

22:55.128 --> 22:58.095
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT
THE RIGHT GUY FOR IT ANYWAY.

22:58.097 --> 23:00.464
I MEAN,
IF YOU WERE SO SMART,

23:00.466 --> 23:03.233
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED
TO PRINCETON OR M.I.T.,

23:03.235 --> 23:04.968
OR MAYBE EVEN HARVARD,
RIGHT?

23:04.970 --> 23:07.404
I GOT INTO PRINCETON,
M.I.T., HARVARD, AND STANFORD.

23:07.406 --> 23:09.071
OH, YEAH,
THEN WHY AREN'T YOU THERE?

23:09.073 --> 23:11.441
BECAUSE...

23:11.443 --> 23:13.110
MY PARENTS DON'T HAVE
THE MONEY.

23:15.513 --> 23:17.613
YEAH, WELL IF YOU WERE
SO SMART,

23:17.615 --> 23:20.249
I'M SURE YOU'D HAVE
A SCHOLARSHIP, RIGHT?

23:20.251 --> 23:22.050
THE IVYS DON'T GIVE
ACADEMIC SCHOLARSHIPS

23:22.052 --> 23:23.519
AND WITH MY FAMILY'S BUSINESS,
IT JUST...

23:23.521 --> 23:24.919
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEVER MIND.

23:24.921 --> 23:26.554
JAMES, I AM
YOUR SAVING GRACE.

23:26.556 --> 23:29.324
I MEAN, IF YOU DO THIS APP,
I WILL GIVE YOU ALL THE MONEY

23:29.326 --> 23:32.292
TO GO TO WHEREVER YOU WANT
TO GO FOR SCHOOLING.

23:32.294 --> 23:33.894
THINK ABOUT IT.

23:33.896 --> 23:36.897
YOU'LL BE LIKE STEVE JOBS
OR STEVE WOZNIAK.

23:36.899 --> 23:38.265
BILL GATES
AND PAUL ALLEN.

23:38.267 --> 23:40.966
MATT DAMON
AND BEN AFFLECK.

23:40.968 --> 23:43.938
LET ME KNOW.
OKAY?

23:48.376 --> 23:52.977
SO, UH, WHAT TIME
IS YOUR NEXT CLASS?

23:52.979 --> 23:54.379
AN HOUR.

23:54.381 --> 23:56.047
YEAH?

23:56.049 --> 23:57.916
I NEED MY DESK
AND MY CHAIR.

23:57.918 --> 24:00.085
WELL, THIS ISN'T GONNA
TAKE LONG, RIGHT? IT'S QUICK.

24:00.087 --> 24:01.653
WELL I NEED IT NOW
IF YOU WANT MY HELP.

24:01.655 --> 24:04.955
WAIT, HOLD ON,
YOU DECIDED TO DO IT?

24:04.957 --> 24:06.056
WELL,
THERE ARE CONDITIONS.

24:06.058 --> 24:07.925
LIKE, NO GIRLS,
NO PARTIES,

24:07.927 --> 24:09.960
NO STAYING UP
UNTIL 3:00 AM WITH FRIENDS.

24:09.962 --> 24:11.395
THIS WILL BECOME
A CODING SANCTUARY.

24:11.397 --> 24:13.062
OH, NO, NO, NO.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

24:13.064 --> 24:15.566
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST CODE
IN THE STUDY ROOM DOWN THE HALL?

24:15.568 --> 24:18.101
- NO.
- WELL, I NEED MY ROOM, DUDE.

24:18.103 --> 24:20.269
WELL, I NEED MY ROOM.

24:20.271 --> 24:23.071
OKAY, WAIT!
YES, YES, YEAH, YEAH,

24:23.073 --> 24:25.209
YOU CAN CODE IN HERE.

24:28.011 --> 24:29.311
WILL YOU ALSO
MAKE ME BREAKFAST?

24:29.313 --> 24:32.481
NO, I WILL NOT MAKE YOU
BREAKFAST, JAMES.

24:32.483 --> 24:36.250
BUT SHE SERIOUSLY DOES
HAVE TO GO.

24:36.252 --> 24:38.052
YEAH, OKAY,
YOU HEARD THE MAN.

24:38.054 --> 24:40.054
TIME TO SKEDADDLE,
GET OUT.

24:40.056 --> 24:42.022
- WILL YOU CALL ME LATER?
- PROBABLY NOT.

24:42.024 --> 24:43.357
HE WON'T.

24:43.359 --> 24:45.225
OKAY, I'LL COME BY
AFTER CLASS.

24:45.227 --> 24:47.661
NO, NO, NO, JAMES AND I
HAVE VERY IMPORTANT WORK TO DO

24:47.663 --> 24:50.397
AND WE NEED PEACE AND QUIET,
BUT, THANK YOU.

24:50.399 --> 24:52.167
SERIOUSLY.

24:54.068 --> 24:55.735
I HAVE ONE MORE CONDITION.

24:55.737 --> 24:58.070
I ALREADY TOLD YOU, I'M NOT
MAKING BREAKFAST FOR YOU IN BED.

24:58.072 --> 25:00.606
IT'S NOT THAT.
I WANT TO DO THIS ANONYMOUSLY.

25:00.608 --> 25:02.441
WELL, THEN WHO IS GONNA
TAKE THE CREDIT

25:02.443 --> 25:04.008
FOR DEVELOPING THE APP?

25:04.010 --> 25:05.677
WELL, CONSIDERING
I HAVE NOT BEEN ACCORDED

25:05.679 --> 25:07.278
VOTING RIGHTS, STILL.

25:07.280 --> 25:09.213
I WOULD SAY, YOU WOULD
TAKE THE CREDIT.

25:09.215 --> 25:10.214
WHO? ME?

25:10.216 --> 25:12.016
- YEAH, YOU.
- WHY?

25:12.018 --> 25:14.318
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT PEOPLE
TO KNOW I'M A PART OF THIS.

25:14.320 --> 25:15.720
WHAT PEOPLE
DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW

25:15.722 --> 25:17.020
THAT YOU'RE A PART
OF THIS APP?

25:17.022 --> 25:18.455
MY MOTHER, FOR ONE.

25:18.457 --> 25:20.290
OH!

25:20.292 --> 25:22.726
WAIT, WE CAN'T TELL MOMMY?
WHY NOT?

25:22.728 --> 25:24.728
OKAY, DO YOU WANT MY HELP
OR NOT?

25:24.730 --> 25:26.663
YEAH, NO, YEAH,
OBVIOUSLY.

25:26.665 --> 25:28.232
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

25:31.536 --> 25:32.570
LET'S GET STARTED.

25:37.442 --> 25:39.608
I FELT LIKE IT WAS
A BAPTISM.

25:40.610 --> 25:42.210
HEY, WHERE'VE YOU GUYS BEEN?

25:42.212 --> 25:44.546
OH, UH...
WE'VE BEEN STUDYING.

25:44.548 --> 25:45.747
FOR REAL?

25:45.749 --> 25:48.115
UH-HUH.
YEAH, WE'RE ACTUALLY CODING

25:48.117 --> 25:50.451
A NEW BREAKTHROUGH PROJECT.

25:50.453 --> 25:51.618
MM-HMM, AND IT'LL BE OUT SOON,
LADIES, SO DON'T FRET.

25:51.620 --> 25:53.287
THAT SOUNDS COOL,
WHAT IS IT?

25:53.289 --> 25:55.556
OH, NO, IT'S...
WE HAVEN'T MADE IT PUBLIC YET.

25:55.558 --> 25:57.691
WHAT LANGUAGE IS IT IN?

25:57.693 --> 26:02.028
- WHAT...
- TELL HER.

26:02.030 --> 26:04.330
- ENGLISH.
- YEAH, ENGLISH.

26:04.332 --> 26:05.598

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.400
YEAH, WE KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT,
WE'RE NOT GONNA TELL YOU THAT,

26:07.402 --> 26:09.067
OKAY?
IT'S PRIVATE.

26:09.069 --> 26:10.538
WE'RE GONNA KEEP IT UNDER WRAPS
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

26:20.179 --> 26:25.716
UH, JAMES...
WHAT IS THIS?

26:25.718 --> 26:27.518
YOU WERE LATE
FOR OUR MEETING.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.720
- WHERE IS THE TV?
- IT'S IN THE CLOSET.

26:29.722 --> 26:32.255
- WHAT ABOUT MY FUTON?
- DEFLATED, FOLDED NEATLY,

26:32.257 --> 26:34.324
- AND TUCKED UNDER THE BED.
- WHAT? NO, DUDE!

26:34.326 --> 26:36.359
I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT
MY FUTON.

26:36.361 --> 26:38.428
AND I CAN'T CODE ANONYMOUSLY
EXCEPT FOR IN THIS ROOM,

26:38.430 --> 26:39.429
AND I CAN'T CODE AT ALL

26:39.431 --> 26:41.733
UNLESS THIS IS MY SANCTUARY.

26:44.435 --> 26:48.136
OKAY, THEN WHAT
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO HERE?

26:48.138 --> 26:49.505
I'D LIKE A TURKEY
AND SWISS ON RYE

26:49.507 --> 26:51.640
WITH LETTUCE, TOMATO,
AND MAYONNAISE, PLEASE.

26:51.642 --> 26:53.775
OH, AND BY THE WAY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANTED ME TO DO WITH THIS.

26:53.777 --> 26:55.443
THAT'S PERFECT RIGHT THERE,

26:55.445 --> 26:57.111
AND I AM NOT GONNA
BE YOUR WAITER.

26:57.113 --> 26:59.447
- DUDE.
- WAIT... OKAY, FINE!

26:59.449 --> 27:02.650
UNLESS IT KEEPS YOU
FROM CODING, SIT DOWN.

27:02.652 --> 27:05.218
DO YOUR THING.

27:05.220 --> 27:09.189
UH, AND WHAT
LANGUAGE ARE WE DOING THIS IN?

27:09.191 --> 27:11.190
ENGLISH.

27:11.192 --> 27:13.860

THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.

27:13.862 --> 27:16.095

- OH, WAS IT A JOKE?

27:16.097 --> 27:18.631
- WAS IT FUNNY?
- NO.

27:18.633 --> 27:21.534
DON'T TRY IT AGAIN, 'CAUSE FUNNY
STUFF DOESN'T WORK FOR YOU, OKAY?

27:21.536 --> 27:23.368
OKAY, I'M SORRY,
I WON'T DO IT AGAIN.

27:23.370 --> 27:26.538
DUDE, WHAT'S THE PROGRAMMING?
I NEED TO BE ABLE TO TELL PEOPLE

27:26.540 --> 27:27.672
WHAT WE'RE DOING IN HERE.

27:27.674 --> 27:29.407
C, JAVA, HTML,
AND RUBY.

27:31.244 --> 27:35.212
OH, DON'T YOU DARE EVEN THINK
ABOUT GETTING SICK ON ME, OKAY?

27:35.214 --> 27:38.515
- OKAY.

27:38.517 --> 27:41.117
WHEN AM I GETTING PAID?

27:41.119 --> 27:43.252
IN TIME FOR YOU

27:48.259 --> 27:50.560
ALL RIGHT GUYS, SO, UH,
I THINK IT'S TIME

27:50.562 --> 27:52.228
FOR A LITTLE POP QUIZ

27:52.230 --> 27:54.129
JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE CAUGHT
UP IN ALL YOUR READING.

27:54.131 --> 27:58.199
HEY, UH, TEACH. YEAH,
I'D LIKE TO BE EXEMPT

27:58.201 --> 28:00.435

28:00.437 --> 28:02.136
ON THE GROUNDS THAT
I'M DEVELOPING A REAL APP

28:02.138 --> 28:03.705
THAT NEEDS MY TIME.

28:03.707 --> 28:07.174
I MEAN, I THINK THAT YOU'D FIND
THAT IT MORE THAN FULFILLS

28:07.176 --> 28:09.476
THE COURSE REQUIREMENTS.

28:09.478 --> 28:11.278
COME OVER HERE, LANCE.

28:11.280 --> 28:14.815
COME ON, I WON'T BITE YA,

28:14.817 --> 28:17.250
I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST
SHARE WITH THE CLASS

28:17.252 --> 28:19.319
DETAILS ABOUT YOUR PROJECT,
HM?

28:19.321 --> 28:20.620
- YOU KNOW, I WOULD...
- OH.

28:20.622 --> 28:23.256
I REALLY WOULD,
BUT MY CONTRACT WITH NASA

28:23.258 --> 28:24.757
PROHIBITS ME
FROM SAYING ANYTHING.

28:24.759 --> 28:26.626
GOSH, YOU KNOW,
I'M REALLY GOOD FRIENDS

28:26.628 --> 28:27.627
WITH THE DIRECTOR OF NASA.

28:27.629 --> 28:29.328

28:29.330 --> 28:32.631
OH, YEAH! WELL, WE'RE WORKING

28:32.633 --> 28:34.266
YOU'RE WORKING ON DNA?

28:34.268 --> 28:37.603
NO, NO, NO. WE'RE WORKING
ON A CODING PROJECT.

28:37.605 --> 28:40.471
OH, SO SIGNED A NON DISCLOSURE
AGREEMENT, AN NDA.

28:40.473 --> 28:41.906
YEAH, AN NDA,
A NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT.

28:41.908 --> 28:43.608
- RIGHT.

28:43.610 --> 28:44.942
- OH, A STANDARD.

28:44.944 --> 28:46.309
A STANDARD ONE, OKAY, GREAT.

28:46.311 --> 28:47.912
YEAH, SO THAT MEANS,
YOU KNOW,

28:47.914 --> 28:49.814
IF WE WERE EVER
TO SAY ANYTHING,

28:49.816 --> 28:51.181
WE WOULD BE...

28:51.183 --> 28:52.415
DEAD, KILLED IN OUR SLEEP.

28:52.417 --> 28:54.584
- AND WHO WOULD WANT THAT?
- NOT ME.

28:54.586 --> 28:56.218
ALL RIGHT,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

28:56.220 --> 28:58.554
I THINK YOU CAN SHARE
WITH THE CLASS

28:58.556 --> 28:59.823
WHAT LANGUAGE
YOU'RE WORKING IN.

28:59.825 --> 29:02.458

29:02.460 --> 29:03.792
- OH, YEAH?
- WOULD THAT BE ENGLISH, LANCE?

29:03.794 --> 29:06.562
NAH, NO. THAT WOULD NOT
BE ENGLISH.

29:06.564 --> 29:09.566
ACTUALLY, WE'RE WORKING IN C,
JAVA, HTML, AND RUBY, SO...

29:12.636 --> 29:13.935
DOES THIS
PROJECT HAVE A NAME?

29:13.937 --> 29:16.236
DOES THIS PROJECT
HAVE A NAME,

29:16.238 --> 29:18.775
YES, IT HAS A NAME.
IT'S CALLED "JUNGLE."

29:20.877 --> 29:23.543
ALL RIGHT, LANCE,
I'LL EXPECT A SUMMARY

29:23.545 --> 29:25.479
WITH ALL PROPRIETARY

THEN, FINE, YOU CAN MISS OUT

29:29.618 --> 29:32.218
ON A FEW QUIZZES.

29:32.220 --> 29:34.553

HEY, HEY! COULD YOU
HOLD IT DOWN?

30:07.452 --> 30:09.986
PLEASE, I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER
ALL THESE TERMS.

30:09.988 --> 30:10.987
I THINK I'M GETTING SICK.

30:10.989 --> 30:13.321
I'M GOING TO BED NOW.

30:13.323 --> 30:15.290
ALL RIGHT, BUT JUST,

30:25.334 --> 30:28.536
I CAN'T, I CAN'T.
I'VE GOT A BAD COLD.

30:28.538 --> 30:31.706
OH, NO, NO, NO. HOW LONG
IS THAT GONNA SET US BACK?

30:31.708 --> 30:34.507
LET'S SEE...

30:34.509 --> 30:37.644
IF IT'S JUST A COLD,
A COUPLE DAYS.

30:37.646 --> 30:42.314
IF IT'S A SINUS INFECTION,
IT COULD BE A COUPLE WEEKS.

30:42.316 --> 30:44.750
WELL... OKAY, WHAT...
OKAY THEN, WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO

30:44.752 --> 30:47.753
TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T TURN
INTO THE INFECTION THING?

30:47.755 --> 30:52.658
UH, WELL, MY MOM WOULD USUALLY
MAKE ME A POT OF HOT TEA,

30:52.660 --> 30:53.892
ALTERNATING WITH SOME
ORANGE JUICE,

30:53.894 --> 30:58.796
WITH 6,000 GRAMS
OF VITAMIN C CRYSTALS.

30:58.798 --> 31:01.032
OH, AND SOME CHICKEN
NOODLE SOUP, OF COURSE.

31:01.034 --> 31:03.400
I'M NOT YOUR MOM, JAMES.

31:03.402 --> 31:05.803
OKAY.

31:05.805 --> 31:08.407
SHOULD LAST NO MORE
THAN A MONTH.

31:18.583 --> 31:20.585
HEY!

31:32.095 --> 31:33.995
LANCE! LANCE!

31:33.997 --> 31:35.697
UH, YEAH?

31:35.699 --> 31:39.333
UH, LISTEN, I JUST FINISHED
READING YOUR PROPOSAL.

31:39.335 --> 31:41.535
I'M REALLY IMPRESSED.

31:41.537 --> 31:44.772
YOU EXEMPLIFY EVERYTHING I AM
TRYING TO CULTIVATE

31:44.774 --> 31:46.874
IN THIS CLASS.
I'M BLOWN AWAY BECAUSE AT FIRST

31:46.876 --> 31:49.742
I THOUGHT, UGH!
BUT YOU'VE SURPRISED ME.

31:49.744 --> 31:51.644
SO I THINK I CAN AGREE
TO YOUR TERMS.

31:51.646 --> 31:55.681
OF COURSE, PENDING THE SUBMISSION
OF YOUR CODED PROGRAM.

31:55.683 --> 31:57.016
OF COURSE,
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

31:57.018 --> 31:59.818
ALL RIGHT.

31:59.820 --> 32:02.689

32:12.131 --> 32:17.402

- THEY ARE GOING TO BUILD A SHRINE TO MY GREATNESS!

32:23.975 --> 32:25.775
HEY!

32:25.777 --> 32:28.379
I'M WORKING,
COME BACK TOMORROW.

32:30.015 --> 32:33.415
YES, YES, HE'S WORKING
ON GETTING "JUNGLE" RIGHT NOW,

32:33.417 --> 32:35.753
I HAVE EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL.

32:40.857 --> 32:42.890
OKAY.

32:42.892 --> 32:47.061
I THINK "JUNGLE" IS OFFICIALLY
READY FOR BETA ROLL OUT.

32:47.063 --> 32:49.531
- WHAT? REALLY?
- YEAH.

32:56.939 --> 32:59.505
AH, DUDE.

32:59.507 --> 33:01.874
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS, DUDE.

33:01.876 --> 33:04.643
THERE COULD BE
A SLIGHT PROBLEM, THOUGH.

33:04.645 --> 33:06.445
WHAT PROBLEM?
WHAT IS IT?

33:06.447 --> 33:09.514
UM, I MEAN THERE'S NO LOGICAL
INCENTIVE FOR THE USERS

33:09.516 --> 33:14.452
OF OTHER HOOK-UP APPS
TO TRANSFER OVER TO JUNGLE,

33:14.454 --> 33:15.954
- YOU KNOW?
- I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT.

33:15.956 --> 33:19.090
YEAH. I MEAN, THERE'S GOTTA BE
A MATHEMATICAL THEOREM

33:19.092 --> 33:21.758
TO CONVINCE THEM.

33:21.760 --> 33:24.095
ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
MY BOY LANCE RIGHT NOW

33:24.097 --> 33:25.863
IS GONNA BREAK IT DOWN
FOR Y'ALL RIGHT NOW.

33:25.865 --> 33:27.731
LISTEN UP, Y'ALL.
WE GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT.

33:27.733 --> 33:29.132
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO,

33:29.134 --> 33:32.035
IS GET OFF OF ALL OF
THE OTHER MATING APPS

33:32.037 --> 33:33.703
AND GET ONTO JUNGLE.

33:33.705 --> 33:35.605
MY BOY DANIEL HERE,
HE DID ALL THE MATHEMATICS,

33:35.607 --> 33:36.873
HE'S GONNA BREAK IT DOWN
FOR YOU.

33:36.875 --> 33:38.708
IT'S ALL HERE,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

33:38.710 --> 33:40.176
I HAVE COME UP
WITH A SIMPLISTIC

33:40.178 --> 33:42.510
YET INTUITIVE
MATHEMATICAL FORMULA

33:42.512 --> 33:44.846
THAT WORKS 10 OUT OF 10 TIMES,
AND IT'S QUITE EASY.

33:44.848 --> 33:46.982
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS DITCH
THE OTHER HOOK-UP APPS

33:46.984 --> 33:49.517
AND SWITCH TO "JUNGLE"
AND THE RESULTS

33:49.519 --> 33:51.186
WILL ASTOUND YOU,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

33:51.188 --> 33:53.054
- THEY WILL ASTOUND YOU.
- OH!

33:53.056 --> 33:54.822
- AND THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.
- MM-HMM.

33:54.824 --> 33:57.458
- WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME...
- NOPE.

33:57.460 --> 33:58.859
- ...TO KNOW A GIRL'S NAME.
- NOPE.

33:58.861 --> 34:01.561
WE DON'T THE TIME
FOR THEM TO KNOW OUR NAMES!

34:01.563 --> 34:03.496
- WHO DOES?
- WE GOT SCHOOL!

34:03.498 --> 34:04.597
DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO PAY FOR A MOVIE?

34:04.599 --> 34:05.598
- NO!
- OR FLOWERS?

34:05.600 --> 34:07.167
NO!

34:07.169 --> 34:08.868
I'M GONNA SAY THE C-WORD,
I KNOW WE DON'T LIKE TO SAY IT,

34:08.870 --> 34:10.069
- ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
- DON'T DO IT TO 'EM.

34:10.071 --> 34:11.971
COMMITMENT.

34:11.973 --> 34:14.139
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE GIRLS
IN YOUR APARTMENTS,

34:14.141 --> 34:16.141
IN YOUR DORMS,
ON A DAILY BASIS,

34:16.143 --> 34:18.577
LINE UP RIGHT NOW
AND GET THESE DIRECTIONS.

34:18.579 --> 34:19.578
ORDERLY FASHION, GENTLEMEN.

34:19.580 --> 34:21.112
THIS HAS NO AGE RESTRICTION.

34:21.114 --> 34:22.813
GIVE IT TO YOUR FIVE-YEAR-OLD
COUSIN, IF YOU NEED TO.

34:22.815 --> 34:24.482
OH, HAND IT TO YOUR FRIENDS,
YOUR FRIEND'S FRIEND.

34:24.484 --> 34:26.650
I GOT ANOTHER ONE!
GIVE IT TO YOUR FRATERNITIES,

34:26.652 --> 34:28.886
GIVE IT TO YOUR BROTHERS,
GIVE IT TO YOUR FRIENDS,

34:28.888 --> 34:30.987
YOUR FRIENDS' FRIENDS,
YOUR COUSINS, YOUR UNCLES,

34:30.989 --> 34:32.889
- ALL OF 'EM!
- YOU NEPHEWS, ALL OF 'EM!

34:32.891 --> 34:34.824
'CAUSE EVERYBODY
SHOULD BE ON JUNGLE.

34:34.827 --> 34:36.828
- WHOO!
- SPREAD THE WORD, Y'ALL.

34:41.233 --> 34:43.833
- TELL HIM ABOUT THE TIME...
- HEY!

34:43.835 --> 34:45.634
- WHOA.
- WE GOT A QUESTION FOR THE DUDE

34:45.636 --> 34:47.036
THAT DEVELOPED
THE "JUNGLE" APP.

34:47.039 --> 34:49.170
- YEAH.
- YO, SO, YOU TELLING ME THESE GIRLS,

34:49.172 --> 34:50.739
INSTEAD OF NAMES,
THEY JUST SEND

34:50.741 --> 34:51.840
A PHOTO OF THEMSELVES
IN THEIR UNDERWEAR?

34:51.842 --> 34:52.841
NO EXCEPTIONS?

34:52.842 --> 34:54.009
I MEAN, THAT'S THE PLATFORM.

34:54.011 --> 34:55.810
- OOH!
- HEY, MAN, I JUST WANTED TO SAY,

34:55.812 --> 34:58.213
- YOU ROCK!
- THAT'S PRETTY SWEET.

34:58.215 --> 34:59.981
YOU ROCK, MAN.

34:59.983 --> 35:03.785
HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU GUYS DOING?

35:03.787 --> 35:05.920
SO FAR I'VE GOTTEN
FOUR SWIPES.

35:05.922 --> 35:07.621
I'VE GOTTEN 19.

35:07.623 --> 35:09.923
I'VE GOTTEN TWO,
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

35:09.925 --> 35:12.159
LET ME SEE
YOUR PROFILE PICTURE?

35:12.161 --> 35:15.762
IT'S OBVIOUS,
YOU NEED TO STAND OUT.

35:15.764 --> 35:18.731
HOW DO YOU STAND OUT
IN YOUR UNDERWEAR?

35:18.733 --> 35:20.533
WITHOUT THEM, OF COURSE.

35:21.970 --> 35:23.736
WELL, I DIDN'T HAVE TO, BUT...

35:23.738 --> 35:26.138
HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE, HANNAH?

35:26.140 --> 35:27.173
ZERO.

35:27.175 --> 35:29.975
OH, HANNAH.

35:29.977 --> 35:32.177
DO YOU NEED US TO HELP YOU
WITH YOUR PROFILE PHOTO?

35:32.179 --> 35:33.745
NO.

35:33.747 --> 35:35.914
I'M NOT GONNA PLAY
WITH THAT APP.

35:35.916 --> 35:37.748
MORE GUYS FOR US.

35:37.750 --> 35:40.118
I JUST DON'T SEE
HOW IT BENEFITS US.

35:40.120 --> 35:42.886
HANNAH, DO YOU WANT TO BE
ALONE FOREVER?

35:42.888 --> 35:45.122
- NO.
- THEN YOU NEED TO GET ON BOARD

35:45.124 --> 35:47.825
AND GET WITH THE APPS.
THAT'S WHERE THE GUYS ARE.

35:47.827 --> 35:49.692
THAT'S TRUE.

35:49.694 --> 35:52.195
SO, WHO HAVE YOU MET?

35:52.197 --> 35:55.598
WELL, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO CALL IT MEETING ANYONE.

35:55.600 --> 35:58.234
BECAUSE YOU JUST HOOK-UP
WITH THEM ONE TIME.

35:58.236 --> 36:00.069
UNLESS THE GUY HITS
A CERTAIN BUTTON

36:00.071 --> 36:01.570
THAT BRINGS YOU BACK
A SECOND TIME.

36:01.572 --> 36:03.005
BUT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO SAY HIS NAME.

36:03.007 --> 36:05.974
- OR TELL HIM YOURS.
- OR ASK HIM ANY QUESTIONS.

36:05.976 --> 36:07.342
OR THEY'LL KICK YOU OFF
THE PLATFORM,

36:07.344 --> 36:08.743
AND YOU HAVE TO WAIT
TWO WEEKS

36:08.745 --> 36:10.078
FOR A RE-TRAINING PERIOD.

36:10.080 --> 36:15.249
OKAY, THAT SOUNDS VERY
LIBERATING, GIRLS,

36:15.251 --> 36:17.286
BUT I'M GONNA GO STUDY.

36:19.322 --> 36:21.621
I WORRY ABOUT HANNAH.

36:21.623 --> 36:23.923
SHE JUST DOESN'T GET IT,
SHE'S SO 20TH CENTURY.

36:23.925 --> 36:26.659
I THINK SHE'S LIKE A BORN
AGAIN CHRISTIAN OR SOMETHING.

36:26.661 --> 36:29.329
THAT EXPLAINS IT.

36:33.168 --> 36:37.369
THESE KIDS HAVE NO IDEA
HOW EASY THIS IS.

36:37.371 --> 36:42.007
"JUNGLE" HAS JUST MOVED IT UP
A WHOLE 'NOTHER LEVEL.

36:42.009 --> 36:46.611
I THINK YOU MEAN DOWN
A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.

36:46.613 --> 36:48.679
- NO.
- HEY, GUYS, GUYS,

36:48.681 --> 36:50.314
HOW'D YOU GUYS LEARN
ABOUT "JUNGLE?"

36:50.316 --> 36:53.617
- UH, MY DENTIST.
- MY ACCOUNTANT.

36:53.619 --> 36:56.920
GOSH! DID YOU JUST HEAR THAT?

36:56.922 --> 36:59.022
"JUNGLE" IS NOW OUT
OF THE CAMPUS

36:59.024 --> 37:01.624
AND OUT INTO THE REAL WORLD,
MY FRIEND.

37:01.626 --> 37:02.992
- OH, WHOO-HOO-HOO.
- THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

37:02.994 --> 37:05.295
GET READY FOR SOME
MAJOR BANK.

37:05.297 --> 37:07.263
- INSANE.
- YOU GUYS, SERIOUSLY,

37:07.265 --> 37:10.066
YOU SHOULD, HOP ON "JUNGLE"
'CAUSE I WOULD LOVE TO SWIPE YOU.

37:10.068 --> 37:12.001
OH!

37:12.003 --> 37:15.304
WHO'S GOT LOW SELF-ESTEEM?
THIS GUY, LET'S GO.

37:16.907 --> 37:19.974
SERIOUSLY, SERIOUSLY,
LET'S SWIPE SOME TIME.

37:19.976 --> 37:22.210
I'M SENSING DISRUPTION
FORM A NEW HOOK-UP APP

37:22.212 --> 37:23.710
CALLED "JUNGLE."

37:23.712 --> 37:25.246
BUT I'M NOT GONNA
WEIGH IN ON IT YET.

37:25.248 --> 37:28.115
FIRST, I'M GONNA EVALUATE
THE AUTHENTICITY.

37:28.117 --> 37:31.285
FAKE NEWS...

37:49.736 --> 37:53.038
SHE CALLED ME
COMPLETELY HYSTERICAL.

37:53.040 --> 37:56.073
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
HAD A GOOD TIME ON "JUNGLE."

37:56.075 --> 37:57.342
THIS DOES NOT LOOK LIKE
A GOOD GUY!

37:57.344 --> 37:59.310
YEAH, MELODY,
THIS GUY WAS A FREAK.

37:59.312 --> 38:01.445
WELL, THE CUTE FREAKS
ARE ON THE APP, SO...

38:01.447 --> 38:05.715
I THINK WE'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT.

38:07.853 --> 38:09.752
DO YOU GUYS THINK
LANCE MADE THE APP?

38:09.754 --> 38:10.920
YEAH, WHY NOT?

38:10.922 --> 38:12.789

AT CODING.

38:12.791 --> 38:16.326
YEAH, WELL, SOMEONE'S
HELPING HIM.

38:16.328 --> 38:18.361
LOOK, ALL I KNOW IS,
WHOEVER MADE THIS APP

38:18.363 --> 38:22.998
IS A HORRIBLE PERSON.

THANK YOU GUYS
FOR COME GETTING ME.

38:24.935 --> 38:27.869
OF COURSE.
WE'RE SORRY, RACHEL.

38:27.871 --> 38:32.974
YOU ARE A SMART AND INTELLIGENT
AND KIND AND FUNNY HUMAN BEING.

38:32.976 --> 38:34.475
YOU NEED TO BE ON THIS APP.

38:34.477 --> 38:38.044
- THIS IS NOT WORTH IT.
- THANK YOU.

38:38.046 --> 38:39.247
'CAUSE YOU'RE THE BEST.

38:42.784 --> 38:45.218
MERRY CHRISTMAS,

UH, YEAH.
I MEAN, LANCE IS THE MAN.

39:47.343 --> 39:50.344
SOME CODING,
MAYBE SOME STUDYING.

39:50.346 --> 39:54.047

41:32.305 --> 41:33.936
- YEAH, BUT NOT WITH GIRLFRIEND.
- NO.

41:33.938 --> 41:35.572
WAIT, IS JUSTIN SEEING
SOMEONE ALREADY?

41:35.574 --> 41:38.409
ALREADY? IT'S BEEN 10 MONTHS
SINCE LEAH'S DIVORCE.

41:38.411 --> 41:39.409
HE'S PROBABLY HAD LIKE
FIVE GIRLFRIENDS.

41:39.411 --> 41:41.077
NO, NO, NO, NO.

41:41.079 --> 41:43.446
I WANT TO KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT HIS DATING HISTORY.

41:43.448 --> 41:45.181
OH, THAT'S JUST BECAUSE OF THE
RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST YOU.

41:45.183 --> 41:47.383
OH, OKAY, IT WAS NOT
A RESTRAINING ORDER,

41:47.385 --> 41:50.285
IT WAS A...
A COUNSELOR'S EVALUATION.

41:50.287 --> 41:51.553
A COUNSELOR'S EVALUATION
TO STOP BREAKING INTO

41:51.555 --> 41:53.121
JUSTIN'S NEW APARTMENT.

41:53.123 --> 41:54.456
I WANT MY CHINA BACK.

41:54.458 --> 41:55.590
WE NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT
MORE SUPPORTIVE

41:55.592 --> 41:57.158
AND GIVE HER SOME CREDIT.

41:57.160 --> 41:58.393
SHE HASN'T BROKEN INTO
JUSTIN'S APARTMENT SINCE

41:58.395 --> 42:00.127
SHE STARTED THE MEDICATION.

42:00.129 --> 42:02.596
I JUST CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
JUSTIN WITH A GIRLFRIEND.

42:02.598 --> 42:06.133
JUST SAYING THE WORDS,
"JUSTIN'S GIRLFRIEND," BLEGH.

42:06.135 --> 42:09.002
I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT WE HAVE
THE EXES AT THE HOLIDAY DINNER.

42:09.004 --> 42:10.604
I MEAN, WE'RE ALL STILL
A FAMILY.

42:10.606 --> 42:12.906
BUT YOU'RE DIVORCED.
YOU'RE NOT A FAMILY ANYMORE.

42:12.908 --> 42:15.908
- YES WE ARE.
- I MEAN, TECHNICALLY WE'RE FAMILY, RIGHT?

42:15.910 --> 42:18.143
AT LEAST, THE KIDS,
AND I DO LIVE WITH HIS PARENTS.

42:19.514 --> 42:21.914
WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE
IT'S TIME THAT YOU

42:21.916 --> 42:23.615
FIND SOMEBODY NEW
AND MOVE ON.

42:23.617 --> 42:26.984
GUYS THAT ARE SINGLE
ARE EITHER TOO YOUNG OR TOO OLD.

42:26.986 --> 42:29.253
OKAY, SO WHERE ARE
THE AGE-APPROPRIATE MEN

42:29.255 --> 42:30.622
IN THEIR 40S AND 50S?

42:30.624 --> 42:32.457
THEY HAVEN'T HAD
THEIR DIVORCES YET.

42:32.459 --> 42:34.592
I HAVE FOUND A NEW WAY
TO MEET PEOPLE.

42:34.594 --> 42:36.561
OOH, SHARE.

42:36.563 --> 42:38.129
IT'S CALLED "JUNGLE."

42:38.131 --> 42:40.665
I'VE HEARD OF "JUNGLE."

42:40.667 --> 42:42.199
YEAH, MY HAIRDRESSER
WAS TELLING ME ALL ABOUT IT.

42:42.201 --> 42:43.701
SHE SAYS THAT'S WHERE
ALL THE GUYS ARE.

42:43.703 --> 42:45.969
YEAH, BUT I HEAR THERE
ARE, LIKE, WEIRD CONDITIONS.

42:45.971 --> 42:48.405
YEAH, AND THE CONDITIONS
ONLY POP UP ON YOUR PHONE

42:48.407 --> 42:50.239
IN TINY PRINT WHEN YOU'RE
ON YOUR WAY TO YOUR DATE.

42:50.241 --> 42:51.475
UH-UH, NOT A DATE.

42:51.477 --> 42:54.176
BUT THEY SHOW UP
WHEN IT'S TOO LATE.

42:54.178 --> 42:56.579
YOU KNOW, A REAL PIECE OF WORK
MUST HAVE MADE THAT "JUNGLE."

42:56.581 --> 42:58.547
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT.

42:58.549 --> 43:01.249
YOU DESERVE TO MEET
SOMEBODY ELSE.

43:01.251 --> 43:02.951
- YEAH.
- TO "JUNGLE."

43:02.953 --> 43:04.986
TO "JUNGLE."

43:04.988 --> 43:10.327
...TO EVERYONE,
FOR CHRISTMAS.

43:14.163 --> 43:15.529
I THINK I HEAR DAD.

43:15.531 --> 43:17.133
OH, I'LL GET HIS GIFT.

43:19.268 --> 43:21.435
HEY, HEY, HEY!
THERE SHE IS!

43:21.437 --> 43:23.336
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL!

43:23.338 --> 43:24.605
MERRY CHRISTMAS, BABY.

43:24.607 --> 43:26.139
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU, TOO.

43:26.141 --> 43:27.740
- MERRY CHRISTMAS!
- SHE'S KINDA YOUNG.

43:27.742 --> 43:29.275
OH, SWEET JESUS.

43:29.277 --> 43:30.610
OH, ASHLEY,
THIS IS TIFFANY.

43:30.612 --> 43:31.644
IS THERE A POWDER ROOM
I CAN USE?

43:31.646 --> 43:33.178
I JUST WANNA CHECK MY FACE

43:33.180 --> 43:35.046
- BEFORE I...
- OH, YEAH, SURE, SURE, SURE.

43:35.048 --> 43:37.584
IT'S RIGHT DOWN THE HALL
OVER THERE TO THE RIGHT.

43:39.253 --> 43:41.520
- UM, DAD?
- OH, YEAH.

43:41.522 --> 43:44.489
I DON'T THINK IS MOM
IS GONNA BE OKAY WITH... THAT.

43:44.491 --> 43:46.123
OH, COME ON,
SHE'LL BE FINE.

43:46.125 --> 43:48.559
LISTEN, YOUR MOTHER AND I
ARE THE BEST OF FRIENDS.

43:48.561 --> 43:50.194
MOM AND I
HAD A COOL DIVORCE.

43:50.196 --> 43:51.228
- OKAY.
- HELLO, HELLO.

43:51.230 --> 43:54.465
- MERRY CHRISTMAS.
- HI!

43:54.467 --> 43:55.733
- HERE.
- OH, THANK YOU.

43:55.735 --> 43:57.135
YOU CAN OPEN IT
NOW OR LATER.

44:00.272 --> 44:02.372
HEY, THANKS FOR COMING.

44:02.374 --> 44:05.409
IT MEANS A LOT TO THE KIDS,
AND TO YOUR PARENTS.

44:07.211 --> 44:10.312
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU FOR THIS,

44:10.314 --> 44:12.550
UH, WE GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU TOO.

44:15.351 --> 44:17.285
OOH.

44:17.287 --> 44:19.253
YEAH, OKAY.

44:19.255 --> 44:22.459
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT SETTLED IN
TO MY PARENTS HOUSE HERE.

44:23.726 --> 44:25.258
WE HAD TO SETTLE SOMEWHERE

44:25.260 --> 44:26.727
AFTER YOU BLEW THROUGH
YOUR INHERITANCE

44:26.729 --> 44:30.230
AND FORECLOSED
ON OUR HOUSE.

44:30.232 --> 44:33.098
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

44:33.100 --> 44:36.235
IT'S IN THE PAST.

44:36.237 --> 44:40.372
YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S JUST
HAVE A LOVELY HOLIDAY.

44:40.374 --> 44:43.542
I AM FOR THAT.

44:43.544 --> 44:45.109
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

44:45.111 --> 44:48.246
UH. THIS IS SPECIAL CHOCOLATE
FROM SWEDEN.

44:48.248 --> 44:49.447
SWITZERLAND.

44:49.449 --> 44:51.483
UM, ARE YOU
ASHLEY'S FRIEND?

44:51.485 --> 44:54.219
- NO, I'M...
- NO, NO, THIS IS TIFFANY.

44:54.221 --> 44:57.356
- UH, SHE'S MY GIRLFRIEND.
- HE FOUND ME ON "JUNGLE."

44:59.291 --> 45:03.160
I THINK I'LL GO KISS
MY MOTHER NOW.

45:03.162 --> 45:05.127
HI.

45:05.129 --> 45:07.431
THE DRESS IS A LITTLE HIGHER
THAN IN YOUR DAY

45:07.433 --> 45:08.732
AND MY DAY.

45:08.734 --> 45:11.100
- I DON'T MIND IT.
- OH, MY GOD.

45:11.102 --> 45:13.669
I MEAN, I'M NOT SAYING THAT
IT'S PROPER IN OUR DAY,

45:13.671 --> 45:15.070
BUT IT'S PROPER
IN THEIR DAY.

45:15.072 --> 45:16.372
WHAT IS HE THINKING?

45:16.374 --> 45:18.075
I, UM...

45:20.110 --> 45:22.544
I DIDN'T KNOW JUSTIN
HAD A GIRLFRIEND.

45:22.546 --> 45:24.112
WE'RE KEEPING IT
UNDER THE RADAR

45:24.114 --> 45:25.680
SINCE
YOUR LAST BREAK-IN, BUT...

45:25.682 --> 45:27.616
...NOW THAT I'M MOVING IN,

45:27.618 --> 45:29.751
- IT'S KIND OF PUBLIC.
- MOVING IN?

45:29.753 --> 45:32.086
YEAH! AND I WOULD LIKE
TO COMPLIMENT YOU

45:32.088 --> 45:35.155
- ON YOUR TASTE IN CHINA.
- MY CHINA.

45:35.157 --> 45:37.591
MM-HMM. THE PLATE SETTINGS THAT
JUSTIN HAS AT HIS APARTMENT.

45:37.593 --> 45:40.761
YEAH, YEAH, THE LENNOX
WITH THE LITTLE PINK FLOWERS.

45:40.763 --> 45:42.830
AND DON'T WORRY,
I ONLY BROKE ONE DINNER PLATE,

45:42.832 --> 45:45.798
BUT I'M GONNA BE SUPER CAREFUL
FROM NOW ON.

45:45.800 --> 45:48.635
THAT'S THE CHINA MY GRANDMOTHER
GOT US ON OUR WEDDING DAY.

45:48.637 --> 45:50.703
WELL, I THINK
SHE'S VERY ATTRACTIVE.

45:50.705 --> 45:52.671
SHE'S LIKE 12 YEARS OLD,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

45:52.673 --> 45:55.340
YEAH, IT'S PERFECT. I'M GONNA
DECORATE THE WHOLE APARTMENT

45:55.342 --> 45:57.342
AROUND THE COLOR SCHEME,
SO, THANK YOU!

46:02.482 --> 46:05.449
YOU'RE WELCOME,
YOU'RE WELCOME.

46:05.451 --> 46:06.884
I MEAN, YOU'RE NAKED,
BUT...

46:06.886 --> 46:09.522
...YOU'RE WELCOME.

46:11.624 --> 46:13.858
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

46:13.860 --> 46:16.459
- NICE TO MEET YOU, TIFFANY.
- HI, NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.

46:16.461 --> 46:18.193
ARE YOU ONE OF
ASHLEY'S FRIENDS?

46:18.195 --> 46:19.629
- OH, NO.
- NO, MOM, THAT'S MY TIFFANY.

46:19.631 --> 46:21.263
EVERYONE KEEPS
ASKING ME THAT.

46:21.265 --> 46:24.233
CAN I GET ANYBODY A DRINK?
WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK?

46:24.235 --> 46:27.336
MAYBE SOME, LIKE...
CHOCOLATE MILK.

46:27.338 --> 46:30.539
UM, YOU GUYS GOING
TO A CLUB AFTER DINNER?

46:30.541 --> 46:32.108
I HOPE SO.

46:38.582 --> 46:41.283
I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE
TO THE ROOM, JAMES.

46:43.887 --> 46:47.723
UM, AREN'T YOU TAKING
ANY TIME OFF FOR CHRISTMAS?

46:49.224 --> 46:51.357
I'M TRYING TO CATCH UP
ON SOME WORK.

46:51.359 --> 46:55.261
ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN.

46:55.263 --> 46:56.596
CAN WHAT?

46:56.598 --> 46:59.699
WELL, I DON'T THINK
YOU CAN CATCH UP

46:59.701 --> 47:02.434
WITH WHATEVER
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

47:02.436 --> 47:04.502
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING
AT A COMPUTER

47:04.504 --> 47:06.840
AND A PHONE ALL DAY.

47:10.744 --> 47:12.410
WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR?

47:12.412 --> 47:15.312
WELL,
I'M NOT SURE,

47:15.314 --> 47:18.782
BUT I AM SURE THAT YOU
HAVE TO FACE PEOPLE

47:18.784 --> 47:21.852
FACE TO FACE
TO FIND IT.

47:21.854 --> 47:23.188
COME ON.

47:24.890 --> 47:26.257
NAH-AH-AH.

47:33.397 --> 47:36.665
- MERRY CHRISTMAS.
- MERRY CHRISTMAS, JAMES.

47:36.667 --> 47:38.400
I HAVE A FAVOR TO ASK.

47:38.402 --> 47:41.603
I WANT YOU TO HELP ME
FACE THE FAMILY.

47:41.605 --> 47:44.438
LET'S GO DOWN THERE
AND YOU TELL AUNT GILDA

47:44.440 --> 47:49.377
THAT YOU CAN'T SEE THAT SHE
HAD ANY BAD PLASTIC SURGERY.

47:49.379 --> 47:51.814
THE RUMOR IS
A DEER SHOT HER.

47:55.317 --> 47:57.384
SWEETHEART,
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE A TOAST?

47:57.386 --> 47:58.986
A SHORT ONE,
A SHORT TOAST.

47:58.988 --> 48:02.889
OKAY, UM...
A TOAST.

48:02.891 --> 48:05.992
I'VE... WHILE WE'RE TOGETHER
I'D LIKE TO HAVE A DINNER,

48:07.628 --> 48:10.996
THAT REALLY MEANS A LOT MORE
THAN JUST EATING.

48:10.998 --> 48:13.932
THESE TWO PEOPLE,
JACK AND KAREN

48:13.934 --> 48:17.502
HAVE BEEN, REALLY, MY EXAMPLE
THAT I'VE LIVED BY.

48:18.973 --> 48:21.639
THEY'VE GONE THROUGH
SO MUCH TOGETHER,

48:21.641 --> 48:25.777
AND THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE HERE
AND THAT WE'RE STILL TOGETHER,

48:25.779 --> 48:28.412
IT'S THOSE THINGS THAT REALLY
MEAN SOMETHING IN OUR LIFE,

48:28.414 --> 48:31.782
THAT LASTS, THAT NOT THE THINGS
THAT ARE MOMENTARY.

48:31.784 --> 48:35.786
I'VE KNOWN MANY,
I'VE LIKED A FEW,

48:35.788 --> 48:37.453
LOVED ONE,

48:37.455 --> 48:38.554
AND HERE'S TO YOU.

48:38.556 --> 48:39.722
- AWW.
- AWW.

48:39.724 --> 48:41.957
MERRY CHRISTMAS,
SWEETHEART.

48:41.959 --> 48:43.626
MERRY CHRISTMAS,
EVERYONE.

48:43.628 --> 48:44.860
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

48:44.862 --> 48:46.962
AWW, MERRY CHRISTMAS...
AWW, THANK YOU.

48:46.964 --> 48:49.865
- THAT WAS SWEET, DAD.
- THAT WAS SO SWEET.

48:49.867 --> 48:53.568
LET'S UH, EMBARGO THE PHONES
FOR DINNER, HUH?

48:53.570 --> 48:55.670
SO, EVERYBODY
JUST GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.

48:55.672 --> 48:57.438
I'LL TAKE YOUR PHONE.

48:57.440 --> 49:00.407
THAT'S A GREAT PICTURE.
UH, THIS...

49:00.409 --> 49:02.876
GIMME...
JAMES, JAMES...

49:02.878 --> 49:05.446
I NEED YOUR PHONE,
WE'RE EMBARGOING THE PHONES.

49:05.448 --> 49:07.648
PLEASE ASHLEY,
YOU CAN TALK LATER.

49:07.650 --> 49:10.918
UM, YOU'D ONLY TEXT ANYWAY.

49:10.920 --> 49:12.487
UH, BILLY...

49:14.522 --> 49:19.859
PUT IT UP.
NOT BAD, NOT BAD.

49:19.861 --> 49:23.495
I CAN'T SEE MY FACE.

49:27.334 --> 49:28.767
I CAN'T SEE MY FACE.

49:28.769 --> 49:30.804
HOW DO I...

49:33.740 --> 49:35.840
HEY, MOM! CAN I...

49:37.043 --> 49:39.677
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

49:39.679 --> 49:42.579
I'M...

49:42.581 --> 49:44.681
I'M TAKING A PICTURE,

49:44.683 --> 49:47.417
BUT ARMS
AREN'T LONG ENOUGH,

49:47.419 --> 49:49.018
SO I NEED YOU
TO TAKE IT FOR ME.

49:49.020 --> 49:50.385
UM, WHAT IS IT FOR?

49:50.387 --> 49:52.088
OH, DON'T TAKE THAT,
TAKE THAT.

49:52.090 --> 49:54.523
IT'S FOR MY COLLECTION.

49:54.525 --> 49:56.658
OKAY, I'M NOT DOING IT UNLESS
YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

49:56.660 --> 49:59.027
- I AM SCARED.
- DON'T BE SCARED,

49:59.029 --> 50:01.063
THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE AFRAID,

50:01.065 --> 50:05.466
IT'S ALL GOOD IN THE HOOD.

50:08.004 --> 50:12.539
IT'S JUST A PICTURE.
READY?

50:12.541 --> 50:17.677
READY?
ONE, TWO, THREE, WINE.

50:18.914 --> 50:21.447
OKAY, LET ME SEE.

50:21.449 --> 50:22.851
IT'S GOOD.

50:24.685 --> 50:28.053
CAN YOU PHOTOSHOP OUT
ABOUT FIVE POUNDS?

50:28.055 --> 50:29.655
IS THERE AN APP FOR THAT?

50:29.657 --> 50:31.757
MOM, THERE'S AN APP
FOR EVERYTHING.

50:31.759 --> 50:33.759
OH, DOWNLOAD IT.

50:33.761 --> 50:35.827
- OKAY, WE DON'T HAVE TO...
- DOWNLOADING!

50:35.829 --> 50:37.929
WAITING FOR THE BLUE LINE.

50:37.931 --> 50:39.564
MOM, WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THAT.

50:39.566 --> 50:40.698
- NO.
- YOU TAKE THIS.

50:40.700 --> 50:42.767
- OKAY.
- I'LL BE TAKING THIS.

50:42.769 --> 50:44.501
OKEY-DOKE.

50:44.503 --> 50:46.104
GOOD NIGHT, HONEY.

50:46.106 --> 50:47.871
GOOD NIGHT.

50:47.873 --> 50:50.707
I'LL SEE YOU MAÑANA.

50:50.709 --> 50:52.810
I WILL SEE YOU...

50:54.113 --> 50:55.948
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

50:59.050 --> 51:02.151
WHAT'S UP, YOU BIG LOSERS?
NO PLANS TONIGHT?

51:02.153 --> 51:04.854
NO, I'M STILL TIRED
FROM YESTERDAY.

51:04.856 --> 51:06.621
I NEED A SPA VACATION
AFTER AN EVENING

51:06.623 --> 51:08.057
TALKING TO AUNT GILDA.

51:08.059 --> 51:09.825
I'M STILL STUDYING
FOR NEXT SEMESTER.

51:09.827 --> 51:11.927
ONLY A PSYCHO DOES THE WORK
A SEMESTER AHEAD OF TIME.

51:13.462 --> 51:15.563
MOM, ARE YOU GOING OUT
WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

51:15.565 --> 51:18.799
- UM, A NEW FRIEND.
- WHO?

51:18.801 --> 51:21.135
I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME,
BUT WE'RE MEETING AT A CAFE.

51:21.137 --> 51:22.903
UH, WHERE DID YOU
MEET HIM?

51:22.905 --> 51:25.706
WELL, WE HAVEN'T
ACTUALLY MET.

51:25.708 --> 51:27.707
I DON'T THINK
I CAN SAY MEET.

51:27.709 --> 51:29.709
I'M SORRY, THERE'S A LOT
OF FUNNY CONDITIONS.

51:29.711 --> 51:30.844
CONDITIONS TO WHAT?

51:30.846 --> 51:32.879
TO WHAT I CAN SAY.

51:32.881 --> 51:35.782
ALL I KNOW IS HE REALLY LIKED
MY PHOTO PROFILE.

51:35.784 --> 51:38.617
OKAY, WHAT PHOTO?

51:38.619 --> 51:40.419
MOM! NO!

51:40.421 --> 51:43.488
IT'S OKAY, HONEY, REALLY,
EVERYONE IS DOING IT.

51:43.490 --> 51:45.423
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I JUST SAID THAT OUT LOUD.

51:45.425 --> 51:47.491
OKAY, MOM,
I DO NOT APPROVE.

51:47.493 --> 51:50.661
OKAY, WELL, IT IS NOT FOR YOU
TO APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE,

51:50.663 --> 51:53.531
ALL RIGHT? I'M GOING
AND I WILL BE BACK LATER.

51:53.533 --> 51:54.866
OKAY, WELL AT LEAST TELL ME
WHERE YOU MET THIS GUY

51:54.868 --> 51:56.100
SO I CAN DO SOME RESEARCH.

51:56.102 --> 51:58.835
FINE, IT'S CALLED "JUNGLE,"
OKAY?

51:58.837 --> 52:01.039
LOVE YOU BOTH!
BYE!

52:05.911 --> 52:09.179
WHAT ARE WE EVEN DOING
FOLLOWING MOM ON HER DATE?

52:09.181 --> 52:11.847
IT'S NOT A DATE.
YOU CAN TRUST ME ON THAT.

52:11.849 --> 52:14.617
I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL THAT
YOUR MOTHER'S SEEING PEOPLE.

52:14.619 --> 52:17.518
SHE NEEDS
TO GET OUT MORE.

52:17.520 --> 52:19.221
I JUST FLORENCE.
I WANT TO MOVE THERE

52:19.223 --> 52:22.457
AND JUST IMMERSE MYSELF
IN THE CULTURE AND THE ART,

52:22.459 --> 52:24.125
JUST THE SHAPES
AND THE COLOR.

52:24.127 --> 52:25.793
ALL RIGHT, SO WE BOTH
LOVE ITALY.

52:25.795 --> 52:27.161
YOU LOVE ITALY, TOO?

52:27.163 --> 52:29.630
YEAH, YEAH, I CAN EAT
PIZZA ALL DAY LONG.

52:29.632 --> 52:31.531
LISTEN, I THINK WE KNOW
EACH OTHER WELL ENOUGH,

52:31.533 --> 52:32.532
LET'S GO.

52:32.534 --> 52:34.101
ARE WE GOING TO EAT PIZZA?

52:34.103 --> 52:36.003
NO, I'VE INVESTED MORE TIME
THAN I WAS PLANNING,

52:36.005 --> 52:38.038
I'M NOT GONNA SPEND
MONEY ON YOU.

52:38.040 --> 52:39.505
I CAN BUY PIZZA.

52:39.507 --> 52:42.575
APARTMENT 754,
JUST FOLLOW ME, OKAY?

52:42.577 --> 52:45.912
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- THAT'S AGAINST THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

52:45.914 --> 52:48.714
ARE YOU COMING?

52:48.716 --> 52:53.685
- NO, NO, I'M NOT.
- I GOTTA GO.

52:53.687 --> 52:55.487
MY NEXT APPOINTMENT'S
WAITING FOR ME.

52:55.489 --> 52:57.589
BUT LISTEN, DON'T PLAY
SO HARD TO GET, LADY!

52:59.226 --> 53:01.259
- YOU OKAY?
- NO, IT WAS AWFUL, I WANT TO GO HOME.

53:01.261 --> 53:03.627
NO, NO, NO, LEAH,

53:03.629 --> 53:05.629
- I WANT TO GO HOME.

53:05.631 --> 53:07.531
HE'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.
HERE, GIVE ME THIS.

53:07.533 --> 53:08.699
GIVE ME THIS, LET'S SEE.

53:08.701 --> 53:09.967
OOH, YOU GOT SOME
NEW SWIPES.

53:09.969 --> 53:11.601
- THAT'S A GOOD SIGN, HONEY.
- NO, NO.

53:11.603 --> 53:13.170
OKAY, LET'S SEE, LET'S LOOK
AT THESE OPTION...

53:13.172 --> 53:16.606
OH! SIGH, INTERESTING.

53:16.608 --> 53:19.108
OH, MY EX-HUSBAND, OKAY.

53:19.110 --> 53:20.877

53:20.879 --> 53:24.613
- YEAH!
- GUYS, THAT'S JUSTIN'S COUSIN, BILL.

53:24.615 --> 53:27.117
YOUR MOTHER'S
LEAVING THE CAFE.

53:28.519 --> 53:31.753
- SHE'S ALONE. BAD SIGN.
- GOOD SIGN.

53:31.755 --> 53:35.090
- OUR WORK IS DONE.
- IT'S JUST BEGUN.

53:35.092 --> 53:38.759
CAN WE TAKE THEM HOME NOW
SO WE CAN GO OUT?

53:38.761 --> 53:40.094
OUT?
IT'S 1:00 AM.

53:40.096 --> 53:41.998
THAT'S WHEN THE CLUBS OPEN.

53:46.702 --> 53:48.170
JAMES.

53:50.138 --> 53:51.938
JAMES.

53:51.940 --> 53:53.108
JAMES.

53:57.212 --> 53:59.211
HONEY, GO TO BED.

53:59.213 --> 54:01.981
- WHERE'D YOU GO?
- OUT.

54:01.983 --> 54:03.581
NO, I MEAN,
AFTER THE CAFE.

54:03.583 --> 54:07.219
YOU LEFT THE CAFE
HOURS AGO.

54:07.221 --> 54:10.788
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE I WAS
AND WHAT TIME I LEFT?

54:10.790 --> 54:12.656
NEW APP.

54:12.658 --> 54:14.092
OH.

54:14.094 --> 54:16.927
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- ABOUT WHAT?

54:16.929 --> 54:19.029
ABOUT MEETING PEOPLE?

54:19.031 --> 54:23.200
OH, WELL...

54:23.202 --> 54:28.604
I GUESS I'M GONNA HAVE TO WRAP
MY HEAD AROUND HOW THINGS ARE,

54:28.606 --> 54:31.273
AND, UM...

54:31.275 --> 54:33.778
I DON'T KNOW,
GET USED TO IT.

54:37.814 --> 54:40.749
I LOVE YOU, JAMES.

54:40.751 --> 54:43.051
GOOD NIGHT.

55:00.702 --> 55:03.136
- WHAT DID YOU DO?
- GET OUT OF MY ROOM.

55:03.138 --> 55:04.871
IT'S MY ROOM NOW.

55:04.873 --> 55:06.172
IF YOU COME IN THIS ROOM
AGAIN WHILE I'M HOME

55:06.174 --> 55:07.873
OR WHILE I'M AWAY,
I'LL SEND OUT A MESSAGE

55:07.875 --> 55:10.343
AND IT'LL GO VIRAL
THAT YOU HAVE AN STD.

55:10.345 --> 55:12.077
OKAY, WELL,
THAT'S A LIE.

55:12.079 --> 55:15.013
- I HAVEN'T EVEN...
- EVEN BETTER, A VIRGIN.

55:15.015 --> 55:18.050
ABSTINENCE IS FAR WORSE
STIGMA IN PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL.

55:18.052 --> 55:20.751
NOTHING WILL RUIN
YOUR SOCIAL STANDING FASTER.

55:20.753 --> 55:22.253
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOUR REAL PARENTS ARE?

55:22.255 --> 55:24.221
BECAUSE I CAN'T
SEEM TO FIGURE IT OUT.

55:24.223 --> 55:27.657
I SEE NOW THAT I'M A SOLDIER
STANDING IN A BATTLEFIELD

55:27.659 --> 55:28.993
ENGAGED IN A WAR FAR WORSE
THAN ANY 18-YEAR-OLD

55:28.995 --> 55:30.261
COULD EVEN FATHOM.

55:30.263 --> 55:32.762
OKAY, STOP THE SOLILOQUY,
I GET IT!

55:32.764 --> 55:35.031
YOU WANT
YOUR ROOM BACK, FINE!

55:35.033 --> 55:36.766
BUT YOU'RE GONNA TURN
INTO A CYBORG.

55:36.768 --> 55:38.667
YOUR HAND AND THE KEYBOARD
ARE GOING TO FUSE

55:38.669 --> 55:39.868
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
MORE EMBARRASSING

55:39.870 --> 55:42.971
THAN YOU ALREADY ARE.

55:42.973 --> 55:44.740
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

55:44.742 --> 55:48.944
I MEAN, NOT THAT I CARE,
BUT IN CASE MOM ASKS.

55:48.946 --> 55:51.712
I HAVE SOME RESEARCH TO DO.

55:51.714 --> 55:53.915
OKAY, UM, I'LL TELL HER
YOU WENT TO THE MALL,

55:53.917 --> 55:56.918
JUST TO GIVE HER A LITTLE HOPE
YOU'RE WITHIN THE BELL CURVE.

55:56.920 --> 55:58.352
I'M NOT GETTING PERSONAL,

55:58.354 --> 56:00.654
BUT YOU KNOW I LIKE
TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

56:00.656 --> 56:03.424
JAMES!

56:03.426 --> 56:06.193
HI, SWEETHEART.

56:06.195 --> 56:08.261
- HEY.
- HI, GRANDMA.

56:08.263 --> 56:11.031
YOU ALL KNOW JAMES,
HE'S HOME FOR HOLIDAY BREAK.

56:11.033 --> 56:12.898
HI, JAMES.

56:12.900 --> 56:15.835
JAMES IS DOING RESEARCH
ON RELATIONSHIPS,

56:15.837 --> 56:18.170
AND HE WOULD TO HAVE
OUR INPUT.

56:18.172 --> 56:20.372
UM, YEAH, SO I HAVE SOME
QUESTIONNAIRES HERE

56:20.374 --> 56:23.211
THAT I'M JUST GONNA PASS OUT
REALLY QUICK.

56:24.945 --> 56:26.811
- YEAH.
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

56:26.813 --> 56:30.681
SO, THESE QUESTIONS
I'VE PREPARED ARE BASED ON

56:30.683 --> 56:33.016
THE MORAYS OF THE '50S
AND '60S,

56:33.018 --> 56:34.785
SO, THEY'RE PRETTY
SELF-EXPLANATORY.

56:34.787 --> 56:36.987
OKAY, COME ON, LET'S SIT DOWN,
SWEETHEART.

56:36.989 --> 56:40.958
LET'S SEE WHAT
JAMES IS RESEARCHING.

56:40.960 --> 56:45.295
"HOW OLD WERE YOU WERE YOU
WHEN YOU FIRST HAD SEX?"

56:45.297 --> 56:48.030
OKAY.

56:48.032 --> 56:51.800
LET ME THINK, UM...

56:51.802 --> 56:52.803
18.

56:56.006 --> 57:00.275
"HOW MANY PEOPLE DID YOU SLEEP
WITH BEFORE YOU GOT MARRIED?"

57:00.277 --> 57:04.179
OH.

57:04.181 --> 57:07.047
THIS IS AWFULLY
PERSONAL, JAMES.

57:07.049 --> 57:08.983
GRANDPA,
I REALLY NEED TO KNOW.

57:08.985 --> 57:11.986
YEAH, ME TOO.

57:11.988 --> 57:14.956
WELL...

57:19.794 --> 57:21.494
NONE.

57:21.496 --> 57:26.064
YOUR GRANDMOTHER WAS
MY HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART,

57:26.066 --> 57:27.966
MY FIRST...

57:27.968 --> 57:30.736
MY LAST...

57:30.738 --> 57:32.037
MY ONLY.

57:32.039 --> 57:35.006
- AWW.
- AWW.

57:40.013 --> 57:43.847
"DID YOU PERSONALLY KNOW
ANY GIRLS THAT GOT PREGNANT

57:43.849 --> 57:47.318
IN HIGH SCHOOL?"

57:47.320 --> 57:49.953
ONLY ONE.

57:49.955 --> 57:54.823
AH HERE'S ONE,
"WHAT MADE A GIRL ATTRACTIVE?"

57:54.825 --> 57:56.259
WELL, THAT'S EASY.

57:56.261 --> 57:58.961
BIG, UH... EYES.

57:58.963 --> 58:00.930
YOU CHICKEN!

58:00.932 --> 58:02.932
I'M A ROMANTIC,
I LOVE BIG EYES,

58:02.934 --> 58:04.766
THEY'RE THE WINDOWS
OF THE SOUL.

58:04.768 --> 58:08.437
WELL,
I LOVE THESE APPETIZERS.

58:08.439 --> 58:10.371
THANK YOU,
THANKS, JOHN.

58:10.373 --> 58:14.042
PUT THAT ON MY LIST OF WHAT
MAKES A GIRL ATTRACTIVE.

58:14.044 --> 58:16.244
MY TURN!

58:16.246 --> 58:20.380
"DID MEN EXPECT WOMEN TO SLEEP
WITH THEM ON THE FIRST DATE?"

58:20.382 --> 58:22.916
WHEN YOU'RE ENGAGED,
IT'S KIND OF EXPECTED.

58:22.918 --> 58:26.520
KAREN, IT WASN'T EXPECTED
IN OUR DAY.

58:26.522 --> 58:29.055
YOU WERE JUST
THE TOWN SLUT.

58:29.057 --> 58:31.891
UH, WOULD YOU BRING SOME
MORE OF THOSE POTATO CHIPS?

58:31.893 --> 58:34.026
THEY'RE JUST GREAT.

58:34.028 --> 58:36.895
SO, ARE YOU SAYING
IT WASN'T A CUSTOMARY THING

58:36.897 --> 58:38.897
FOR A GIRL TO BE
PROMISCUOUS?

58:38.899 --> 58:43.168
NO, NO, NO, IT WASN'T CUSTOMARY
FOR WOMEN TO BE PROMISCUOUS,

58:43.170 --> 58:45.503
I MEAN, YEAH, YOU KIDS
REALLY HAVE IT MADE TODAY.

58:45.505 --> 58:49.241
JOHN! IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT SEX,
YOU KNOW.

58:49.243 --> 58:52.477
SORRY, SWEETHEART.

58:52.479 --> 58:56.280
"HOW DO YOU FEEL WHEN A MAN
LEAVES YOU RIGHT AFTER SEX?"

58:56.282 --> 58:58.249
- ARE YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?
- NO.

58:58.251 --> 58:59.250
I WANNA KNOW WHERE
YOU'RE GOING.

58:59.252 --> 59:00.950
NOWHERE!

59:00.952 --> 59:03.419
UH, JAMES, LET'S YOU AND I
HAVE A LITTLE TALK.

59:03.421 --> 59:04.821
COME OVER HERE JUST A SECOND.

59:04.823 --> 59:06.489
LEAVE THE COMPUTER.

59:06.491 --> 59:11.762
WELL, UM, WOULD YOU LIKE SOME
MORE LAYS POTATO CHIPS, CAROLYN?

59:13.230 --> 59:16.064
JAMES, WHAT'S WITH
ALL THESE QUESTIONS?

59:16.066 --> 59:18.066
I'M JUST DOING
SOME RESEARCH.

59:18.068 --> 59:21.969
MY SEX LIFE IS INTEGRAL
TO THIS PROCESS?

59:21.971 --> 59:24.105
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
RELATIONSHIPS.

59:24.107 --> 59:25.406
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
HAVE ONE

59:25.408 --> 59:27.174
WITH A WHOLE HUMAN BEING.

59:27.176 --> 59:28.609
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING TO DO.

59:28.611 --> 59:32.846
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ANOTHER APP IS THE ANSWER.

59:32.848 --> 59:36.349
I WASN'T PLANNING ON
MAKING ANOTHER APP, BUT...

59:36.351 --> 59:38.451
WHAT OTHER APP?

59:38.453 --> 59:41.920
I DON'T MY SEX LIFE
ON SNACK-CHAT,

59:41.922 --> 59:43.289
OR ONE OF THOSE...

59:43.291 --> 59:45.324
WHY WOULD I WANT TO DO THAT?

59:45.326 --> 59:48.627
WHY WOULD I WANT
GRANDMOTHER ON SNACK-CHAT?

59:48.629 --> 59:49.927
- OH.
- I HAVE AN IDEA.

59:49.929 --> 59:52.163
OH, NO. OH, NO.

59:52.165 --> 59:53.499
HEY, HONEY!

59:53.501 --> 59:55.601
WHAT WERE YOU AND GRANDPA
TALKING ABOUT?

59:55.603 --> 59:58.202
OH, I GET IT,
BOY'S CLUB STUFF.

59:58.204 --> 01:00:00.371
OKAY, WELL, THERE IS CHILI
IN THE KITCHEN

01:00:00.373 --> 01:00:01.639
IF YOU'RE HUNGRY.

01:00:01.641 --> 01:00:04.941
- ARE YOU EATING?
- NO, I'M GOING OUT.

01:00:04.943 --> 01:00:06.910
- WHERE?
- UM, I DON'T KNOW,

01:00:06.912 --> 01:00:08.445
I'M WAITING FOR A SWIPE.

01:00:08.447 --> 01:00:09.946
MOM, I NEED TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

01:00:09.948 --> 01:00:11.048
OH! I GOT A SWIPE!

01:00:11.050 --> 01:00:12.882
NO, MOM,
DON'T TOUCH YOUR PHONE,

01:00:12.884 --> 01:00:15.184
DON'T GO OUT TONIGHT,
OKAY?

01:00:15.186 --> 01:00:17.553
HONEY, YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO SCHOOL,

01:00:17.555 --> 01:00:20.956
I HAVE TO MEET PEOPLE,
I...

01:00:20.958 --> 01:00:23.461
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

01:00:29.032 --> 01:00:31.299
ANYWAYS, SHE'S CRAZY.

01:00:31.301 --> 01:00:34.101
HEY, BUT BACK TO WHAT
I WAS SAYING,

01:00:34.103 --> 01:00:37.938
WE ARE PLANNING TO RELEASE
A FULL BLOWN...

01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:39.239
PUN INTENDED...

01:00:39.241 --> 01:00:40.908
VERSION OF THE APP
IN THE SPRING, OKAY?

01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:43.042
AND WE ARE ACTUALLY EXPECTED
TO BE VALUED AT AROUND,

01:00:43.044 --> 01:00:45.912
I DON'T KNOW,
$250,000,000.

01:00:45.914 --> 01:00:48.548
WHOO, AND THAT IS WHEN WE'RE
GONNA TAKE IT PUBLIC,

01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:49.851
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN.

01:01:07.468 --> 01:01:09.200
YOU MAY WANT TO CALL
AN EXTERMINATOR FIRST, DUDE.

01:01:09.202 --> 01:01:10.601
THE APP HAS SOME BUGS

01:01:10.603 --> 01:01:13.337
NO, NO, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE,
ACTUALLY.

01:01:13.339 --> 01:01:14.705
NO, MM-MM.

01:01:14.707 --> 01:01:17.207
THE APP IS DOWN, MAN,
CHECK IT OUT.

01:01:17.209 --> 01:01:18.509
HEY, JAMES!

01:01:18.511 --> 01:01:20.678
CAN YOU COME SEE
IF YOU CAN FIX THIS?

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:23.513
FIX WHAT?

01:01:23.515 --> 01:01:25.582
MY PHONE ISN'T WORKING.

01:01:25.584 --> 01:01:27.282
I WAS ABOUT TO GET
THE ADDRESS OF WHERE

01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:29.686
I WAS GONNA MEET UP
AND THEN IT JUST... IT'S GONE.

01:01:29.688 --> 01:01:31.120
UH...

01:01:31.122 --> 01:01:34.056
...ACTUALLY, NO,
NO, THE APP IS NOT DOWN.

01:01:34.058 --> 01:01:36.425
WE'RE JUST WORKING ON AN
UPDATE, SOME BACK-END SHIT.

01:01:36.427 --> 01:01:38.494
IT'LL BE UP REAL SOON.
A COUPLE OF DAYS AT THE MOST.

01:01:38.496 --> 01:01:41.429
PROGRAM MUST BE DOWN.

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:43.364
WELL, I'LL JUST GO ON
ONE OF THE OTHER APPS, RIGHT?

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:45.566
I'LL JUST USE SOME OF
THE OTHER APPS.

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:48.369
THE OTHER APPS.

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:50.738
YEAH, EXCEPT THEY'RE DOWN TOO.

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.038
WHAT'S WRONG.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.540
- THE APP.
- THE APP'S NOT WORKING.

01:01:53.542 --> 01:01:54.674
- NO.
- IT'S NOT?

01:01:54.676 --> 01:01:56.176
NO, IS YOURS?

01:01:56.178 --> 01:01:58.010
HEY, UH, DID ANY OF OUR GUYS
TAKE DOWN

01:01:58.012 --> 01:01:59.345
ALL THE HOOK-UP APPS,
BY CHANCE?

01:01:59.347 --> 01:02:01.347
MY PLANS FOR THE NIGHT
TOTALLY RUINED.

01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:04.016
THAT WOULD BE
SOME SERIOUS DISRUPTION.

01:02:04.018 --> 01:02:07.051
JAMES, HONEY,
IT IS THE DARNDEST THING.

01:02:07.053 --> 01:02:09.120
LIKE, I TOUCH IT,
AND IT DOES NOTHING.

01:02:09.122 --> 01:02:10.989
IT JUST DOES NOTHING.

01:02:10.991 --> 01:02:12.257
COULD YOU PLEASE FIX THIS?

01:02:12.259 --> 01:02:15.059
MOM, I'M FIXING IT,
TRUST ME, OKAY?

01:02:15.061 --> 01:02:16.561
I'M FIXING EVERYTHING.

01:02:16.563 --> 01:02:18.430
CALL JAMES RIGHT NOW!
PRONTO!

01:02:18.432 --> 01:02:20.130
YEAH, I WILL!
I NEED YOU TO STOP STRESSING.

01:02:20.132 --> 01:02:21.398
- WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS.
- I'M SORRY.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.100
EVERYTHING IS FINE,
YOU CAN RELAX.

01:02:23.102 --> 01:02:24.168
DID YOU PUT SOMETHING IN THIS?

01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:27.640
YEAH. I'M CALLING HIM.
JAMES...

01:02:35.046 --> 01:02:39.047
MOM, UH...

01:02:39.049 --> 01:02:40.483
LOOK, I JUST WANT
TO LET YOU KNOW

01:02:40.485 --> 01:02:44.453
THAT I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING
FOR ME AND ASHLEY.

01:02:44.455 --> 01:02:46.521
TRYING TO BE FRIENDS
WITH DAD

01:02:46.523 --> 01:02:48.523
SO THAT WE DON'T FEEL LIKE
WE'VE LOST OUR FAMILY,

01:02:48.525 --> 01:02:50.592
BUT I JUST WANT TO LET
YOU KNOW THAT IT'S OKAY

01:02:50.594 --> 01:02:52.326
IF YOU WANT TO BE MAD AT HIM,

01:02:52.328 --> 01:02:56.030
AND IT'S OKAY IF YOU WANT
TO START A NEW LIFE.

01:02:56.032 --> 01:02:57.665
NOTHING'LL CHANGE BETWEEN US.

01:02:57.667 --> 01:03:02.570
THANKS, GUYS.

01:03:02.572 --> 01:03:05.806
I NEEDED TO HEAR THAT.
OH! WAIT!

01:03:05.808 --> 01:03:08.107
I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW
I'M MOVING BACK IN

01:03:08.109 --> 01:03:09.676
- TO YOUR BEDROOM.
- VIRGIN.

01:03:09.678 --> 01:03:14.048
OCD. BUT I MIGHT MISS YOU
A LITTLE.

01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:18.417
HERE IT IS.
IT'S TEA.

01:03:18.419 --> 01:03:19.785
VERY SPECIAL CHINESE
HERBAL TEA.

01:03:19.787 --> 01:03:21.386
IT WILL HELP YOU RELAX,

01:03:21.388 --> 01:03:23.489
AND IT'LL HELP YOU GET
A GREAT NIGHT'S SLEEP.

01:03:23.491 --> 01:03:25.623
TAKE IT.
BUT DON'T TAKE TOO MUCH.

01:03:25.625 --> 01:03:26.825
I MEAN, IT'S ALL-NATURAL,
BUT I DON'T KNOW

01:03:26.827 --> 01:03:28.294
HOW STRONG IT IS.

01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:33.129
BYE, SWEETIE.

01:03:36.836 --> 01:03:39.269
WHO'S CALLING YOU?

01:03:39.271 --> 01:03:41.271
I DON'T KNOW.

01:03:41.273 --> 01:03:44.273
MUST BE IMPORTANT,
IT'S RINGING NON-STOP.

01:03:44.275 --> 01:03:46.611
UH, YEAH.
YEAH, IT IS.

01:03:50.147 --> 01:03:52.180
- YO!
- HEY!

01:03:52.182 --> 01:03:53.449
"JUNGLE" IS STILL DOWN, DUDE!

01:03:53.451 --> 01:03:54.850
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:03:54.852 --> 01:03:57.151
YOU ARE NOT GONNA GET PAID
TO GET INTO M.I.T.

01:03:57.153 --> 01:03:58.520
UNLESS IT'S UP
IN AN HOUR.

01:03:58.522 --> 01:04:00.822
COME ON, JAMES,
THIS IS KIND OF AN EMERGENCY.

01:04:00.824 --> 01:04:03.324
YEAH, THE OTHER HOOK-UP APPS ARE STILL DOWN.

01:04:03.326 --> 01:04:04.459
HEY, WE'RE GONNA
TIE YOU TO THE DESK

01:04:04.461 --> 01:04:06.796
UNTIL YOU FIX THIS, BRO!

01:04:08.731 --> 01:04:11.665
WELL, I CAN UNLOCK IT
WITH THIS.

01:04:11.667 --> 01:04:13.800
HOW THE HELL DID YOU
LEARN HOW TO LOCK PICK?

01:04:13.802 --> 01:04:15.201
MY CELLMATE TAUGHT ME.

01:04:15.203 --> 01:04:17.236
- OH, THERE WE GO!
- WHOA-HO-HO!

01:04:17.238 --> 01:04:18.638
CELLMATE? WHAT?

01:04:28.448 --> 01:04:29.614
HANNAH! HANNAH!

01:04:29.616 --> 01:04:30.782
JAMES, WHY ARE YOU RUNNING?

01:04:30.784 --> 01:04:32.183
I'M TRYING TO RUN
FROM MY ROOMMATE

01:04:32.185 --> 01:04:33.184
AND I NEED A PLACE TO STAY,
PLEASE.

01:04:33.186 --> 01:04:34.519
- LANCE?
- YES.

01:04:34.521 --> 01:04:35.554
OKAY, YOU BET
I'M HELPING YOU WITH THIS.

01:04:35.556 --> 01:04:37.123
- FOLLOW ME.
- OKAY.

01:04:45.898 --> 01:04:47.598
WAIT, HANNAH, HANNAH.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.900
UM, ONE DAY I'M GONNA
DO SOMETHING

01:04:49.902 --> 01:04:51.568
THAT'LL EARN
YOUR TRUST BACK.

01:04:51.570 --> 01:04:53.670
JAMES, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

01:04:53.672 --> 01:04:56.639
- I'M OKAY WITH HELPING YOU.
- WHY?

01:04:56.641 --> 01:04:58.675
WHY AM I OKAY
WITH HELPING YOU?

01:04:58.677 --> 01:05:02.411
NO, WHY ARE YOU SO SHY?

01:05:02.413 --> 01:05:06.315
IT'S OKAY.
YOU CAN TELL ME.

01:05:06.317 --> 01:05:09.250
JAMES, I HAD A REALLY
BAD STUTTER,

01:05:09.252 --> 01:05:11.786
AND WHEN I GET NERVOUS
AND I TRY TO TALK

01:05:11.788 --> 01:05:13.821
IN FRONT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE
SOMETIMES IT COMES BACK,

01:05:13.823 --> 01:05:16.292
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO STOP IT.

01:05:18.528 --> 01:05:21.595
IS THAT WHY YOU DON'T
TALK MUCH IN CLASS

01:05:21.597 --> 01:05:23.797
EVEN THOUGH
YOU KNOW ALL THE ANSWERS?

01:05:23.799 --> 01:05:25.767
YEAH.

01:05:30.304 --> 01:05:31.773
- HI.
- HI.

01:05:33.307 --> 01:05:34.840
WHAT ARE YOU TWO
DOING TOGETHER?

01:05:34.842 --> 01:05:36.942
OKAY, LOOK, JAMES NEEDS
A PLACE TO HIDE.

01:05:36.944 --> 01:05:39.745
ONLY FOR A FEW HOURS,
HOPEFULLY.

01:05:39.747 --> 01:05:42.614
MAYBE HE CAN HELP US STUDY?

01:05:42.616 --> 01:05:44.882
HAVE A BETTER IDEA,

01:05:44.884 --> 01:05:48.386
IF YOU MAKE US AN APP,
LIKE, "JUNGLE FOR GIRLS"

01:05:48.388 --> 01:05:50.688
I JUST MIGHT LET YOU
STAY HERE.

01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:52.289
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

01:05:52.291 --> 01:05:53.724
"JUNGLE" REALLY
MESSED ME UP.

01:05:53.726 --> 01:05:55.559
GUYS, WE KNOW THAT LANCE
MADE "JUNGLE"

01:05:55.561 --> 01:05:57.227
AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE HIM
REGRET IT.

01:05:57.229 --> 01:06:00.797
YES, AND I'M KIND OF
RETIRING FROM APPS FOR NOW.

01:06:00.799 --> 01:06:02.598
OKAY, SO THE ANSWER IS NO.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.700
I MEAN, RIGHT AFTER
I MAKE YOUR APP.

01:06:04.702 --> 01:06:06.302
I THOUGHT HE WAS FIXING
"JUNGLE."

01:06:06.304 --> 01:06:07.970
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID
HE WAS DOING, MAN.

01:06:07.972 --> 01:06:10.773
WHERE IS HE, LANCE?
THIS IS KIND OF AN EMERGENCY.

01:06:10.775 --> 01:06:13.441
YEAH, THE OTHER HOOK-UP APPS
ARE STILL DOWN.

01:06:13.443 --> 01:06:15.910
OH, THIS IS BAD,
THIS IS REALLY BAD.

01:06:15.912 --> 01:06:17.479
SHOULD WE CALL 9-1-1?

01:06:17.481 --> 01:06:20.149
THIS IS COMPLICATED SHIT.
HOLY CRAP!

01:06:22.886 --> 01:06:25.219
- ARE YOU GONNA EAT THAT?
- YEAH.

01:06:25.221 --> 01:06:28.422
WELL, THERE'S MOLD ON IT
SO BE CAREFUL, BUD.

01:06:28.424 --> 01:06:30.758
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I'M JUST THINKING

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:32.425
OF MAYBE WE DO SOME WAY
TO ORGANIZE

01:06:32.427 --> 01:06:33.894
ALL OF THIS INFORMATION.

01:06:33.896 --> 01:06:37.230
- MAYBE REBUILD, OR...
- YOU'RE GONNA REBUILD THE APP?

01:06:37.232 --> 01:06:38.998
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE I'LL HIRE
SOMEONE TO DO IT, MAN. YEAH.

01:06:41.536 --> 01:06:43.002
COME ON, MAN!
IT'S MY CONCEPT,

01:06:43.004 --> 01:06:45.506
THIS IS FREAKING APP,
IT'S JUST...

01:06:50.644 --> 01:06:53.779
ALL RIGHT, LADIES, SO JAMES
IS HERE BECAUSE HE HAS AGREED

01:06:53.781 --> 01:06:57.648
TO CREATE A RELATIONSHIP APP
FOR YOU GUYS, SO...

01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:59.252
OKAY.

01:07:01.821 --> 01:07:05.455
OKAY. UM...

01:07:05.457 --> 01:07:09.392
GIRLS, HOW YOU DOING?
ARE YOU HAPPY?

01:07:09.394 --> 01:07:12.429
I MEAN,
I LIKED MY CHRISTMAS PRESENTS.

01:07:12.431 --> 01:07:14.698
I MEAN, ARE YOU SATISFIED
WITH LIFE?

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:16.765
I HAVE TO STUDY FOR A TEST.
SORRY.

01:07:16.767 --> 01:07:20.602
HOW'S YOUR LOVE LIFE?

01:07:20.604 --> 01:07:23.672
BY LOVE, I MEAN LOVE.

01:07:23.674 --> 01:07:26.842
NOT SEX.

01:07:26.844 --> 01:07:30.712
HONESTLY?
NOT TOO GOOD.

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:33.514
MINE'S GREAT.
I'M NEVER LONELY.

01:07:33.516 --> 01:07:35.415
INVITED OUT EVERY NIGHT.

01:07:35.417 --> 01:07:39.053
HE SAID LOVE, NOT SEX.
ZIP IT, HOOK.

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:42.322
DO YOU FEEL LIKE GUYS ARE USING
YOU AS JUST A PIECE OF MEAT?

01:07:42.324 --> 01:07:44.858
- THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I FEEL.
- ARE YOU A PSYCH MAJOR?

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:48.728
DO YOU WANT A GUY TO PURSUE YOU FOR
MORE THAN JUST A SWIPE OF HIS FINGER?

01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:50.429
YEAH.

01:07:50.431 --> 01:07:53.032
ARE YOU SELLING SOME
SPECIAL MAKEUP OR SOMETHING?

01:07:53.034 --> 01:07:54.867
OR UNDERWEAR?

01:07:54.869 --> 01:07:57.803
NO, I'M NOT SELLING A SPECIAL
KIND OF MAKEUP OR UNDERWEAR.

01:07:57.805 --> 01:08:00.572
I'M TRYING
TO TURN THINGS AROUND.

01:08:00.574 --> 01:08:02.941
GIRLS, I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU
GET YOUR POWER BACK.

01:08:02.943 --> 01:08:04.809
WHAT KIND OF POWER
IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

01:08:04.811 --> 01:08:06.811
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT MAYBE HE'S ONTO SOMETHING.

01:08:06.813 --> 01:08:10.314
LOOK, MY SPECIALTY
IS ALGORITHMS.

01:08:10.316 --> 01:08:11.882
NOW, I KNOW THAT MAY NOT
SOUND LIKE MUCH,

01:08:11.884 --> 01:08:16.352
BUT IN FACT ALGORITHMS
AND BIOLOGY WORK HAND IN HAND.

01:08:16.354 --> 01:08:18.354
I HAVE THIS APP
AND I'D LIKE TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

01:08:18.356 --> 01:08:19.990
I KNEW HE WAS
SELLING SOMETHING.

01:08:19.992 --> 01:08:22.425
NO, I'M NOT SELLING ANYTHING.
I'M HERE TO GIVE, NOT SELL.

01:08:22.426 --> 01:08:24.961
- SO WHAT'S THE CATCH?
- THE CATCH IS...

01:08:24.962 --> 01:08:28.529
THAT IF I GIVE THIS APP TO YOU
AND EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW IT WORKS,

01:08:28.532 --> 01:08:31.600
THEN IT'S UP TO YOU
TO LET IT WORK.

01:08:31.602 --> 01:08:33.435
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

01:08:33.437 --> 01:08:34.770
SEE, IT MEANS THAT
WHEN YOU'RE DATING A GUY...

01:08:34.772 --> 01:08:38.439
SWEETHEART,
LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT THERE.

01:08:38.441 --> 01:08:40.841
NONE OF US
HAVE BEEN ON A DATE.

01:08:40.843 --> 01:08:42.877
- WELL, SINCE WHEN?
- SINCE EVER.

01:08:42.879 --> 01:08:43.978
NONE OF YOU?

01:08:43.979 --> 01:08:45.979
GUYS NOWADAYS
DON'T DATE YOU.

01:08:45.982 --> 01:08:48.413
- THEY JUST SLEEP WITH YOU.
- THEN LET'S CHANGE THAT.

01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:50.951
- HOW?
- WITH MY APP

01:08:50.953 --> 01:08:53.419
AND WITH YOUR COOPERATION.

01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:54.921
AND THE COOPERATION
OF YOUR SISTERS

01:08:54.923 --> 01:08:56.457
ON EVERY COLLEGE CAMPUS.

01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:02.761
HANNAH? WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE IDEA?

01:09:02.763 --> 01:09:06.131
DO YOU LIKE IT?

01:09:06.133 --> 01:09:11.002
HONESTLY, NO, I DON'T.

01:09:11.005 --> 01:09:15.073
I DON'T THINK THAT AN APP IS THE
PROPER SOLUTION FOR RELATIONSHIPS.

01:09:17.609 --> 01:09:20.644
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE I WAS JUST
BORN IN THE WRONG CENTURY.

01:09:20.645 --> 01:09:22.444
I AGREE.

01:09:22.447 --> 01:09:24.883
NO WONDER YOU HAVE
NO CLUE WHAT'S GOING ON.

01:09:30.856 --> 01:09:32.388
OH, THERE HE IS.

01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:34.756
- HEY, GUYS.
- WHERE YOU BEEN, MAN?

01:09:34.759 --> 01:09:36.759
UH, MEETING.

01:09:36.761 --> 01:09:38.727
HEY, YOU'RE GROUNDED
UNTIL "JUNGLE" IS FIXED

01:09:38.729 --> 01:09:40.428
- WHAT?
- YEP.

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:41.964
I'M TRYING TO GET IT BACK UP,
GUYS.

01:09:41.966 --> 01:09:43.765
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

01:09:43.767 --> 01:09:46.167
WHILE YOU'RE HAVING A HARD TIME,
I'M GETTING DEATH THREATS

01:09:46.170 --> 01:09:47.969
FOR TAKING DOWN
THE HOOKUP APPS.

01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:49.906
PEOPLE THINK I DID IT
AS A PUBLICITY STUNT.

01:09:54.176 --> 01:09:56.977
THEY THINK
THAT HE BUILT THE APP

01:09:56.979 --> 01:09:58.979
'CAUSE HE DIDN'T.
THAT'S WHY IT'S FUNNY.

01:09:58.981 --> 01:10:00.514
THEY THINK
THAT I BUILT "JUNGLE."

01:10:00.516 --> 01:10:01.915
THEY THINK THAT
I CAN TAKE DOWN THE HOOKUP APPS.

01:10:01.917 --> 01:10:03.116
YEAH, YOU DIDN'T BUILD
"JUNGLE," THOUGH.

01:10:03.118 --> 01:10:04.717
NO, I CREATED IT.
IT WAS MY IDEA.

01:10:04.719 --> 01:10:07.720
SHH.

01:10:07.722 --> 01:10:10.957
JAMES, YOU NEED TO GET "JUNGLE"
BACK UP RIGHT NOW.

01:10:10.959 --> 01:10:14.126
OUR LIVES ARE ON THE LINE
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

01:10:14.128 --> 01:10:16.461
AND ANOTHER THING.
DON'T JUDGE ME.

01:10:16.463 --> 01:10:18.530
I'M STRESS EATING.
IT'S A REAL DISORDER.

01:10:18.532 --> 01:10:19.965
GOOGLE IT.

01:10:19.967 --> 01:10:21.666
OKAY, CALM DOWN.

01:10:21.668 --> 01:10:24.768
WE'RE JUST GONNA
TAKE A CHILL PILL.

01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:27.905
GUYS, IF YOU WANT ME TO DO THIS,
I'M GONNA NEED MY ROOM BACK.

01:10:27.907 --> 01:10:29.773
NO, WE ARE GOING
TO SIT RIGHT HERE

01:10:29.775 --> 01:10:31.775
AND WATCH YOU
UNTIL YOU GET THIS DONE.

01:10:31.777 --> 01:10:33.610
OKAY, IF YOU WANNA GET PAID
FOR M.I.T.,

01:10:33.612 --> 01:10:35.812
THEN YOU BETTER GET THIS THING
BACK UP AND RUNNING, STAT.

01:10:35.814 --> 01:10:36.981
NO, I CAN'T WORK LIKE THIS.

01:10:36.983 --> 01:10:38.648
YOU'RE GONNA SIT RIGHT THERE

01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:39.816
AND YOU'RE GONNA WORK.

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:44.553
RIGHT NOW.
GO AHEAD.

01:10:44.555 --> 01:10:46.690
VAMOS. OH, NO,
I'LL TAKE THAT.

01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:55.163
ALL RIGHT,
GET TO WORK.

01:10:55.165 --> 01:10:57.665
NO, STOP IT.
SPIT IT OUT.

01:10:57.667 --> 01:11:00.968
YOU HAVE ANY MORE?
AH. GOSH, YOU'RE SO WEIRD.

01:11:00.970 --> 01:11:02.670
- LANCE?
- YES.

01:11:02.672 --> 01:11:04.774
I'D LIKE SOME TEA PLEASE.
WITH HONEY.

01:11:07.043 --> 01:11:08.708
YEAH, OKAY.

01:11:08.710 --> 01:11:11.111
I MAKE HIM TEA AND HONEY
SO THAT HE CAN WORK.

01:11:11.113 --> 01:11:13.747
YOU KNOW? HE'S SICK,
SO I DON'T WANT HIM TO...

01:11:13.749 --> 01:11:15.918
- THAT'S CUTE.
- I'D DO IT FOR YOU GUYS.

01:11:18.886 --> 01:11:20.586
I'D LIKE THIS ONE, PLEASE.

01:11:20.588 --> 01:11:22.254
MY MOM GAVE IT TO ME

01:11:22.256 --> 01:11:24.123
SO I CAN STAY UP LATE
AT NIGHT.

01:11:24.125 --> 01:11:25.691
IT KEEPS ME UP
SO I CAN STUDY.

01:11:25.693 --> 01:11:28.160
- ALL RIGHT.
- OH, DOUBLE STRENGTH, PLEASE.

01:11:28.162 --> 01:11:30.862
YOU KNOW.
I WANNA GET THIS DONE TONIGHT.

01:11:30.864 --> 01:11:32.530
OKAY.

01:11:32.532 --> 01:11:37.068
LANCE.
I'LL TAKE ONE, TOO.

01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:38.769
JUST SO I CAN STAY UP,

01:11:38.771 --> 01:11:42.606
BE ALERT,
READY TO POUNCE.

01:11:42.608 --> 01:11:44.975
ACTUALLY, SIGN ME UP, TOO.

01:11:44.977 --> 01:11:49.246
I WANT ONE. AND SOME COFFEE.
AND SOME DONUTS.

01:11:49.248 --> 01:11:52.682
RIGHT. YOU WANT ME TO THROW ON AN
APRON AND A STRING OF PEARLS, TOO?

01:11:52.684 --> 01:11:54.884
AS LONG AS THE APRON SAYS
"HOME, SWEET HOME."

01:11:54.886 --> 01:11:57.585
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

01:11:57.587 --> 01:12:00.224
- YOU GUYS ARE RIDICULOUS. JUST WATCH HIM, OKAY?
- YEAH.

01:12:55.173 --> 01:12:59.876
OH, SHIT. HEY, WESLEY.

01:12:59.878 --> 01:13:01.610
HE'S GONE. WESLEY!

01:13:03.115 --> 01:13:04.247
HE'S GONE.

01:13:04.249 --> 01:13:06.083
- HUH?
- HE'S GONE.

01:13:08.085 --> 01:13:09.785
- WAKE UP!
- OH, WHAT?

01:13:09.787 --> 01:13:13.224
- HE GOT OUT!
- COME ON, DUDE!

01:13:20.096 --> 01:13:23.764
HEY. LOOK. IT LOOKS LIKE I'M
GONNA HAVE TO STAY THE NIGHT.

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:25.233
- WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
- WHAT?

01:13:25.235 --> 01:13:27.335
WE HAD A BET ON HOW LONG
IT WOULD TAKE FOR YOU

01:13:27.337 --> 01:13:29.036
TO TRY TO SLEEP
WITH ONE OF US,

01:13:29.038 --> 01:13:31.071
ESPECIALLY AFTER YOUR
PHONY SPEECH AND ALL.

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:33.672
WHAT? NO, THE SPEECH, THE APP,
IT WAS ALL REAL.

01:13:33.674 --> 01:13:36.809
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- I JUST NEED A PLACE TO STAY FOR THE NIGHT.

01:13:36.811 --> 01:13:39.145
SO, WAIT A MINUTE.

01:13:39.147 --> 01:13:40.379
YOU DON'T WANNA
SLEEP WITH ME?

01:13:40.381 --> 01:13:42.647
NO, I NEVER...
NO, I DON'T... I REALLY...

01:13:42.649 --> 01:13:44.150
I TOLD YOU HE WAS GAY.

01:13:44.152 --> 01:13:46.951
I'M NOT GAY. WHY DOES
EVERYBODY HERE THINK THAT?

01:13:46.953 --> 01:13:48.955
- YOU LIKE GIRLS?
- YES, I LIKE...

01:13:51.858 --> 01:13:53.559
I LIKE HANNAH.

01:13:56.695 --> 01:13:58.729
HEY, IT'S ALL SETTLED.

01:13:58.731 --> 01:13:59.897
HE CAN STAY.

01:13:59.899 --> 01:14:01.832
- COME ON.
- THANK YOU.

01:14:01.834 --> 01:14:03.934
SERIOUSLY, LOOK,
I DON'T TAKE UP MUCH SPACE.

01:14:03.936 --> 01:14:06.070
I JUST NEED MAYBE
A CLOSET OR SOMETHING.

01:14:06.072 --> 01:14:07.904
IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

01:14:07.906 --> 01:14:10.273
NO, THERE'S
A GUEST ROOM UPSTAIRS.

01:14:10.275 --> 01:14:11.240
SERIOUSLY?

01:14:11.242 --> 01:14:12.341
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,

01:14:12.343 --> 01:14:14.709
AND I DO MEAN ANYTHING,

01:14:14.711 --> 01:14:16.912
HANNAH WILL HELP YOU.

01:14:16.914 --> 01:14:20.148
LOOK, AND IF ANYONE
COMES LOOKING FOR ME,

01:14:20.150 --> 01:14:21.249
DON'T LET THEM IN.

01:14:21.251 --> 01:14:23.185
I WON'T LET ANYONE IN.

01:14:23.187 --> 01:14:24.354
GOOD NIGHT, HANNAH.

01:14:25.923 --> 01:14:27.890
GOOD NIGHT, JAMES.

01:14:28.925 --> 01:14:30.660
OH, UH, HANNAH.

01:14:34.964 --> 01:14:38.767
I'M... JAMES WILSON SINGER.

01:14:40.135 --> 01:14:42.137
JAMES WILSON SINGER.

01:14:44.139 --> 01:14:45.340
I LIKE THAT.

01:14:47.409 --> 01:14:51.076
GOOD.
WHAT'S YOUR MIDDLE NAME?

01:14:51.078 --> 01:14:53.347
I'M HANNAH GRACE MARTIN.

01:14:55.082 --> 01:14:57.382
THAT FITS YOU.

01:14:57.384 --> 01:14:59.418
KIND OF EMBODIES YOUR EYES

01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:03.054
AND YOUR HAIR AND YOUR HANDS
ALL IN ONE SENTENCE.

01:15:03.056 --> 01:15:05.724
IT'S... I DON'T KNOW,
LIKE A SONG.

01:15:09.928 --> 01:15:11.362
GOOD NIGHT, JAMES.

01:15:11.364 --> 01:15:14.933
GOOD NIGHT.
THANK YOU.

01:15:20.838 --> 01:15:23.239
SO WHY CAN'T WE
LET THEM IN?

01:15:23.241 --> 01:15:24.974
BECAUSE THEY WANT
TO KILL HIM.

01:15:24.976 --> 01:15:26.375
YEAH, WE GOTTA
KEEP HIM ALIVE

01:15:26.377 --> 01:15:28.477
SO HE CAN HELP US
FINISH THE APP

01:15:28.479 --> 01:15:31.380
AND TEACH US HOW TO TAKE
OUR POWER BACK.

01:15:31.382 --> 01:15:33.014
WELL, I GUESS
HE CAN SHOW US

01:15:33.016 --> 01:15:34.449
HOW TO MAKE GUYS
TALK TO US

01:15:34.451 --> 01:15:36.484
LIKE HE DID TO YOU.

01:15:36.486 --> 01:15:39.454
YOU KNOW, THIS SORORITY IS FINALLY
TAKING ON A WORTHWHILE PROJECT,

01:15:39.456 --> 01:15:41.924
AND I FOR ONE AM EXCITED.

01:15:45.494 --> 01:15:48.495
STOP! STOP!
STOP! STOP! STOP!

01:15:48.497 --> 01:15:50.963
THERE HE IS,
RIGHT THERE IN THE WINDOW.

01:15:50.965 --> 01:15:52.232
COME ON. LET'S GO.

01:15:52.234 --> 01:15:54.468
GO! GO! GO! GO! GO!

01:15:56.271 --> 01:15:59.038
LET US IN.

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.006
HEY, HEY, HEY.

01:16:01.008 --> 01:16:02.475

01:16:02.477 --> 01:16:04.276
WE WANT JAMES.

01:16:04.278 --> 01:16:05.844
BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM.

01:16:05.846 --> 01:16:08.413
CAN YOU JUST LET US
INTO THE HOUSE? PLEASE?

01:16:08.415 --> 01:16:10.315
NO, I CAN'T
AND IF YOU DON'T LEAVE,

01:16:10.317 --> 01:16:11.949
I'M GONNA CALL
CAMPUS SECURITY.

01:16:11.951 --> 01:16:14.319
OH, REALLY? WELL,
WE HAVE A KEY TO THIS SORORITY.

01:16:14.321 --> 01:16:16.387
ONE OF YOU BIMBOS GAVE IT TO ME,
IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER.

01:16:16.389 --> 01:16:18.923
WELL, THEN COME RIGHT IN,
SWEETHEART.

01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:24.528
YOU WANT HIM,
COME AND GET HIM.

01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:28.531
YOU KNOW WHAT? W-WE GOT
THIS THING WITH THE STUFF.

01:16:28.533 --> 01:16:30.266
SO WE'RE GONNA
JUST HEAD OUT,

01:16:30.268 --> 01:16:32.502
BUT IT'S GOOD TO
SEE YOU.

01:16:32.504 --> 01:16:35.237
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT LOOKS LIKE YOU GIRLS
COULD USE YOUR BEAUTY SLEEP ANYWAY.

01:16:35.239 --> 01:16:36.872
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA...

01:16:36.874 --> 01:16:38.874
YOU LOOK...

01:16:38.876 --> 01:16:40.242
WESLEY!

01:16:40.244 --> 01:16:42.010
OKAY, LADIES,

01:16:42.012 --> 01:16:43.911
HOW ABOUT
WE JUST TALK THIS OUT

01:16:43.913 --> 01:16:45.046
OVER BREAKFAST TOMORROW ON ME.

01:16:45.048 --> 01:16:46.448
COFFEE AND BAGELS, LANCE?

01:16:46.450 --> 01:16:48.449
HOW ABOUT A GIFT CARD
TO BAGEL BOYS.

01:16:48.451 --> 01:16:49.850
THEY'RE INSANE. RUN!

01:16:49.852 --> 01:16:52.255
DANIEL: DON'T TOUCH ME!

01:16:54.557 --> 01:16:56.426
COFFEE AND BAGELS.

01:17:01.163 --> 01:17:04.397
WHAT DID YOU SHOCK ME
LIKE THAT FOR?

01:17:04.399 --> 01:17:06.234
INTERNAL BLEEDING.

01:17:09.036 --> 01:17:11.537
LANCE,
THOSE FEMALES HATE YOU.

01:17:11.539 --> 01:17:14.275
THEY HATE US. NOT ME.
WHAT IS THAT?

01:17:17.345 --> 01:17:18.943
OKAY, WHAT THE EFF
HAPPENED BACK THERE?

01:17:18.945 --> 01:17:21.112
I MEAN, WHAT WAS THAT?
WHAT WERE THEY DOING?

01:17:21.114 --> 01:17:22.981
I DON'T KNOW.
WHY YOU LOOKING AT ME?

01:17:22.983 --> 01:17:24.015
I DON'T KNOW.

01:17:24.017 --> 01:17:25.416
I KNOW.

01:17:25.418 --> 01:17:27.284
WHAT... WHAT?
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

01:17:27.286 --> 01:17:29.186
BRO, IT'S OBVIOUS.
OKAY?

01:17:29.188 --> 01:17:31.154
ONE, ALL THE HOOKUP APPS
ARE DOWN.

01:17:31.156 --> 01:17:33.390
TWO, JAMES IS NOW LIVING
IN A SORORITY HOUSE.

01:17:33.392 --> 01:17:34.924
JUST PUT THEM TOGETHER.

01:17:34.926 --> 01:17:36.493
YOU THINK THOSE
ARE ACTUALLY CONNECTED HERE?

01:17:36.495 --> 01:17:38.261
OF COURSE.

01:17:38.263 --> 01:17:40.096
OH, YEAH,
THERE'S A CONNECTION.

01:17:40.098 --> 01:17:42.231
HE'S GOT ALL THE CHICKS,
AND WE DON'T.

01:17:42.233 --> 01:17:44.267
WHAT IF HE'S JUST,
YOU KNOW,

01:17:44.269 --> 01:17:46.402
WORKING ON SOMETHING
FOR US.

01:17:46.404 --> 01:17:49.104
HE'S A GENIUS. THIS COULD BE SOMETHING
BIGGER AND BETTER FOR ALL OF US.

01:17:49.106 --> 01:17:50.305
THAT'S STUPID, LANCE.
STUPID.

01:17:50.307 --> 01:17:51.973
HE WANTS
ALL THE GIRLS TO HIMSELF.

01:17:51.975 --> 01:17:53.441
HE'S GREEDY LIKE THAT.

01:17:53.443 --> 01:17:55.477
OH, MY GOD.
THEY, LIKE, LOVE HIM.

01:17:55.479 --> 01:17:57.044
I KNOW. DID YOU SEE
THE WAY THAT THEY

01:17:57.046 --> 01:17:59.346
THREW THOSE WEAPONS OUT
JUST TO DEFEND HIM?

01:17:59.348 --> 01:18:00.948
BRO, THOSE WEAPONS
WERE TO KILL US.

01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:04.018
THAT HAIR BRUSH
WAS TO BEAT US, MAIM US.

01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:06.919
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, I THINK
THOSE ARE THE SAME THING.

01:18:06.921 --> 01:18:11.157
OKAY, LOOK.
WE NEED A NEW PLAN, OBVIOUSLY.

01:18:11.159 --> 01:18:12.492
- FIGURE ONE OUT...
- SHH.

01:18:12.494 --> 01:18:14.527
NO. NO, NO, NO,
YOU'RE DONE WITH THAT, OKAY?

01:18:14.529 --> 01:18:16.362
JAMES IS NOW LIVING
IN THE SORORITY HOUSE.

01:18:16.364 --> 01:18:17.563
WE CALL THEM
SORORITY SISTERS.

01:18:17.565 --> 01:18:19.299
THEY'RE ALL OF
THE TEAM CAPTAINS.

01:18:19.301 --> 01:18:20.866
ALL BY HIMSELF.

01:18:20.868 --> 01:18:23.435
HE'S IN THERE
WITH ALL OF THEM BY HIMSELF.

01:18:23.437 --> 01:18:25.971
AND GUESS WHERE WE ARE?
WE'RE OUT HERE.

01:18:25.973 --> 01:18:27.406
AS A RESULT OF YOUR PLAN,
LANCE,

01:18:27.408 --> 01:18:30.910
WE'RE IN ICE.
FRIGID COLD. OKAY?

01:18:33.346 --> 01:18:35.513
WE WILL MAKE A NEW PLAN,
OKAY?

01:18:35.515 --> 01:18:36.547
- FINE.
- GOT IT.

01:18:36.549 --> 01:18:38.449
- I HAVE AN IDEA.
- LET'S GO.

01:18:38.451 --> 01:18:41.086
IT'S GONNA INVOLVE TWO CATS,
A PARACHUTE, AND A PLANE.

01:18:43.488 --> 01:18:45.188
GOD, MELODY HASN'T
TEXTED ME BACK SINCE...

01:18:45.190 --> 01:18:47.457
NO ONE CARES. JUST STOP.

01:18:47.459 --> 01:18:48.491
HEY, RACHEL.

01:18:48.493 --> 01:18:50.327
SO WE STILL DOWN FOR TONIGHT?

01:18:50.329 --> 01:18:51.661
IF YOU WANNA SEE ME,
WESLEY,

01:18:51.663 --> 01:18:53.295
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO ASK ME OUT

01:18:53.297 --> 01:18:55.331
ONE WEEK IN ADVANCE
AND TAKE ME OUT TO DINNER

01:18:55.333 --> 01:18:57.132
SO WE CAN TALK AND GET TO
KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER.

01:18:57.134 --> 01:18:59.234
- WHAT?!
- LAUREN, WE STILL ON FOR TONIGHT?

01:18:59.236 --> 01:19:02.136
- FOR WHAT?
- FOR WHAT? YOU KNOW FOR WHAT. COME ON NOW.

01:19:02.138 --> 01:19:04.906
THE FRIENDS-WITH-BENEFITS PROGRAM
HAS OFFICIALLY BEEN DISCONTINUED.

01:19:04.908 --> 01:19:07.375
TRY FLATTERY.
THAT'S ON WOMEN SINCE EVE.

01:19:07.377 --> 01:19:10.010
YOU LOOK SO NICE, RACHEL.

01:19:10.012 --> 01:19:12.179
WHAT DID I TELL YOU, LAUREN.
BOTOX HELPS.

01:19:12.181 --> 01:19:14.247
NOW I SEE YOU FINALLY LOST
THOSE FIVE POUNDS

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:15.382
YOU WERE SO WORRIED ABOUT,
MELODY.

01:19:15.384 --> 01:19:17.918
WHAT?
IT'S A COMPLEMENT.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.486
NO, IT WASN'T.
MINE WAS.

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:21.488
WE JUST... WE NEED TO FORGET
ABOUT WOMEN FOR A WHILE

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:25.257
BECAUSE MY GRADE IN CS
DEPENDS HIGHLY ON THIS APP.

01:19:25.259 --> 01:19:28.327
OKAY, JUST TELL THEM THAT
YOU'RE WORKING ON AN UPDATE.

01:19:28.329 --> 01:19:29.662
"JUNGLE" 2.0.

01:19:29.664 --> 01:19:33.231
OKAY.

01:19:33.233 --> 01:19:35.567
NICE, JAMES.
GOOD.

01:19:35.569 --> 01:19:39.504
HEY, LANCE, WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH "JUNGLE"?

01:19:39.506 --> 01:19:44.108
UM, UH...

01:19:44.110 --> 01:19:46.110
WE'RE WORKING
ON AN UPDATE RIGHT NOW,

01:19:46.112 --> 01:19:47.978
AND THE NEW AND IMPROVED
VERSION OF "JUNGLE"

01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:49.413
WILL BE RELEASED
AS SOON AS IT'S DONE.

01:19:49.415 --> 01:19:51.515
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SHARE WITH THE CLASS

01:19:51.517 --> 01:19:53.484
THE WORKFLOW PROCESS
IT TAKES

01:19:53.486 --> 01:19:55.485
TO DEBUG AND DEVELOP
AN UPDATE?

01:19:55.487 --> 01:19:56.620
THE ONLY THING IS THAT...

01:19:56.622 --> 01:19:58.388
SPEAK UP, LANCE.

01:19:58.390 --> 01:20:02.057
THE REST OF THE CLASS
WANTS TO TAKE DETAILED NOTES.

01:20:02.059 --> 01:20:06.629
WELL, THAT WOULD BE IN VIOLATION
OF THE NDA THAT WE AGREED.

01:20:06.631 --> 01:20:08.263
I EXPECT BY THE END OF TODAY

01:20:08.265 --> 01:20:10.065
TO HAVE A FULL-PAGE OUTLINE

01:20:10.067 --> 01:20:11.600
OF YOUR WORKFLOW PROCESS.
ALL RIGHT?

01:20:11.602 --> 01:20:14.569
WAIT, AND SORRY.
I FORGET.

01:20:14.571 --> 01:20:17.271
DID YOU TELL ME THAT NASA
COMMISSIONED "JUNGLE"?

01:20:17.273 --> 01:20:19.206
MM-HMM, YEAH,
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:20:19.208 --> 01:20:21.108
YOUR NEXT ASSIGNMENT
WILL PROBABLY BE WHAT,

01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:23.945
STUDYING THE MATING RITUALS
ON MARS?

01:20:25.748 --> 01:20:29.017
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ALL FOR TODAY, CLASS.
HAVE A GOOD ONE.

01:20:41.562 --> 01:20:43.162
THERE THEY ARE.

01:20:43.164 --> 01:20:45.397
I THINK WE SHOULD
CALL A PRESS CONFERENCE.

01:20:45.399 --> 01:20:48.099
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

01:20:48.101 --> 01:20:51.102
TELL THE WORLD
WHO REALLY CREATED "JUNGLE."

01:20:51.104 --> 01:20:53.504
SMART. SMART.

01:20:53.506 --> 01:20:55.005
HEY. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
POPS,

01:20:55.007 --> 01:20:58.508
WHAT'S THE NUMBER
TO YOUR PUBLICIST?

01:20:58.510 --> 01:21:00.446
I GOT SOME ROCKIN' NEWS
I WANNA TELL THEM.

01:21:02.381 --> 01:21:05.515
YEAH, OKAY, PRE-MED'S FINE.
THANKS FOR ASKING.

01:21:05.517 --> 01:21:08.986
ALL RIGHT. I LOVE YOU. JUST
TEXT ME THE NUMBER. YEAH. BYE.

01:21:11.722 --> 01:21:14.089
HE HAS TO TAKE ME
TO MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT.

01:21:14.091 --> 01:21:16.258
AND NOT ASK ME FOR MY CREDIT
CARD SO I CAN PAY FOR IT.

01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:19.327
AND NOT ASK THE WAITRESS
FOR HER NUMBER IN FRONT OF ME.

01:21:19.329 --> 01:21:21.031
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
CALL THE APP, JAMES?

01:21:23.467 --> 01:21:25.133
WHAT DO YOU GIRLS THINK
OF "EVE"?

01:21:25.135 --> 01:21:27.970
EVE.
THE FIRST WOMAN.

01:21:29.606 --> 01:21:35.476
HANNAH, WHAT DOES A GUY HAVE
TO DO TO EARN YOUR TRUST?

01:21:35.478 --> 01:21:39.278
A GUY SHOULD BE HONEST.

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:42.215
IF HE'S A LIAR,
THAT'S A DEAL BREAKER.

01:21:42.217 --> 01:21:43.716
HE SHOULD TELL ME THE TRUTH

01:21:43.718 --> 01:21:46.452
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT
WILL HURT MY FEELINGS OR NOT.

01:21:46.454 --> 01:21:48.821
ISN'T THAT A LITTLE UNREALISTIC,
THOUGH, HANNAH?

01:21:48.823 --> 01:21:51.724
OKAY, CLEARLY WE UNDERESTIMATED
JAMES HERE, LIKE, BIG TIME.

01:21:51.726 --> 01:21:53.792
NO, IT'S CLEAR
THAT JAMES IS A DICK

01:21:53.794 --> 01:21:55.529
AND A BACKSTABBER.

01:21:59.833 --> 01:22:02.500
WHAT DO YOU THINK
MAKES HIM TICK?

01:22:02.502 --> 01:22:06.570
- UM, THAT NERDY CHICK, FOUR-EYES...
- HANNAH.

01:22:06.572 --> 01:22:07.671
YEAH, YEAH, HANNAH.

01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:09.172
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HER?

01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:10.841
WELL, HER FULL NAME'S
HANNAH MARTIN,

01:22:10.843 --> 01:22:14.143
AND SHE KEEPS A LOW PROFILE.

01:22:14.145 --> 01:22:16.112
NO, SHE KEEPS A "NO" PROFILE.

01:22:16.114 --> 01:22:17.814
SHE'S NOT ON ANY
OF THE DATING APPS.

01:22:17.816 --> 01:22:19.248
NO, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:21.216
NO, NO, NO,
IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

01:22:21.218 --> 01:22:22.551
IT'S VERY POSSIBLE.

01:22:22.553 --> 01:22:24.255
SHE'S OFF THE GRID.

01:22:31.394 --> 01:22:32.861
OKAY, LADIES,

01:22:32.863 --> 01:22:34.629
EVERYONE TURN OFF
THEIR CELL PHONES,

01:22:34.631 --> 01:22:36.497
THEIR TABLETS,
AND THEIR LAPTOPS.

01:22:36.499 --> 01:22:39.233
WE'RE GONNA TRY
OUR VERY BEST TO CONCENTRATE...

01:22:39.235 --> 01:22:42.369
...ON JAMES

01:22:42.371 --> 01:22:44.604
BECAUSE HE HAS SOMETHING'S
VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL US.

01:22:44.606 --> 01:22:46.139
HE'S BEEN STUDYING US

01:22:46.141 --> 01:22:47.807
AND LISTENING
TO WHAT WE WANT FROM MEN,

01:22:47.809 --> 01:22:50.243
AND HE'S
ABOUT TO REVEAL TO US

01:22:50.245 --> 01:22:52.512
TO ULTIMATE APP.

01:22:52.514 --> 01:22:53.813
WHERE'S HANNAH?

01:22:53.815 --> 01:22:55.347
SHE SAID SHE'S GONNA BE LATE,

01:22:55.349 --> 01:22:57.316
SO WE CAN GO AHEAD
AND START WITHOUT HER.

01:22:57.318 --> 01:22:59.385
OKAY.

01:22:59.387 --> 01:23:04.723
LADIES, IT'S BEEN A REAL EYE-OPENER
LIVING WITH YOU ALL THESE DAYS.

01:23:04.725 --> 01:23:07.859
AND I THINK IF FINALLY DISCOVERED
THE ULTIMATE DATING APP,

01:23:07.861 --> 01:23:09.794
AND I'D LIKE TO PRESENT IT
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

01:23:09.796 --> 01:23:13.297
NEWS FLASH,
THE HOOKUP APPS ARE BACK UP.

01:23:13.299 --> 01:23:16.834
- GET OFF OF ME.
- YOU'RE NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO HAVE YOUR PHONE ON.

01:23:16.836 --> 01:23:18.335
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

01:23:18.337 --> 01:23:19.670
WE'RE GONNA LISTEN TO JAMES

01:23:19.672 --> 01:23:21.607
AND DECIDE
WHICH APP IS BETTER.

01:23:25.844 --> 01:23:29.345
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:23:29.347 --> 01:23:31.581
YOU ARE THE APP.

01:23:31.583 --> 01:23:36.217
LOOK, I KNOW ALGORITHMS.
I KNOW BIOLOGY.

01:23:36.219 --> 01:23:38.853
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
THAT I CAN CODE, INVENT,

01:23:38.855 --> 01:23:41.656
OR CREATE

01:23:41.658 --> 01:23:45.259
THAT EQUALS WHAT GOD HAS
ALREADY CREATED INSIDE OF YOU.

01:23:45.261 --> 01:23:47.896
JAMES, THE GUYS DECIDE
WHICH APPS RULE.

01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:50.864
NO, SEE,
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.

01:23:50.866 --> 01:23:52.566
YOU DECIDE.

01:23:52.568 --> 01:23:54.367
IF NONE OF THE GIRLS
ARE ON THE APPS,

01:23:54.369 --> 01:23:56.937
WHERE ARE THE GUYS GONNA GO?

01:23:56.939 --> 01:23:58.939
GIRLS, YOU HAVE THE POWER.

01:23:58.941 --> 01:24:01.541
DON'T GIVE THAT UP.

01:24:01.543 --> 01:24:04.309
IT'S LIKE FIFTH-WAVE FEMINISM.

01:24:04.311 --> 01:24:06.511
I LIKE IT.

01:24:06.513 --> 01:24:08.881
TIFFANY MOVED OUT.

01:24:08.883 --> 01:24:11.483
I ASKED HER TO MOVE OUT.

01:24:11.485 --> 01:24:13.785
MAN, SEEING YOU
ON THAT DATE,

01:24:13.787 --> 01:24:16.454
IT JUST...
IT JUST DID SOMETHING TO ME.

01:24:16.456 --> 01:24:17.689
OKAY, YOU SPIED ON ME?

01:24:17.691 --> 01:24:19.657
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

01:24:19.659 --> 01:24:22.960
YEAH, LISTEN.
CAN'T WE START FRESH?

01:24:22.962 --> 01:24:25.563
NOW FOR SOME
NEWS FROM OUR TECH BUREAU....

01:24:25.565 --> 01:24:27.598
TAKE YOU
ON A SECOND HONEYMOON.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:31.735
I PROMISE YOU I WILL MAKE IT UP
TO YOU THE REST OF MY LIFE.

01:24:31.737 --> 01:24:34.971
- YEAH, YOU WILL.
- ...COLLEGE FRESHMAN NAMED JAMES SINGER.

01:24:34.973 --> 01:24:37.473
THE REPORT ALSO STATES
THAT JAMES SINGER...

01:24:37.475 --> 01:24:39.909
WHAT IS THAT?
IS THAT YOUR RADIO?

01:24:39.911 --> 01:24:44.446
WHAT, "JUNGLE"?
WHAT THE...

01:24:44.448 --> 01:24:47.950
...I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT YOU REALLY HURT MY SOCIAL LIFE TOO.

01:24:47.952 --> 01:24:50.284
I KNEW HE WAS MY BOY.
WHO NEEDS A PATERNITY TEST?

01:24:50.286 --> 01:24:52.587
IN BASKETBALL, THE COURTS
WERE BUSY LAST NIGHT...

01:24:52.589 --> 01:24:54.455
DID YOU SEE THAT?

01:24:54.457 --> 01:24:56.658
WAIT A MINUTE.
I'M CONFUSED.

01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:58.492
DID JAMES MAKE THE APP?

01:24:58.494 --> 01:25:00.895
OR DID HE TAKE DOWN
THE APPS?

01:25:00.897 --> 01:25:03.830
BOTH.
HE'S A GENIUS.

01:25:03.832 --> 01:25:08.436
THEY SAY THAT GENIUS MANIFESTS
ITSELF EVERY OTHER GENERATION.

01:25:10.438 --> 01:25:11.771
WHAT?

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:14.473
YOUR BROTHER
INVENTED "JUNGLE"?

01:25:14.475 --> 01:25:16.575
HE'S WAY COOL.

01:25:16.577 --> 01:25:17.643
I KNOW.

01:25:17.645 --> 01:25:21.947
JAMES SINGER.

01:25:21.949 --> 01:25:23.817
I KNEW IT.

01:25:25.619 --> 01:25:27.819
IS HE THE CRAZY KID
WHO KEPT CALLING ME?

01:25:27.821 --> 01:25:29.621
WAY TO GO, JAMES.

01:25:29.623 --> 01:25:31.923
THINK WE NEED TO MAKE
A DETOUR TO SEE THIS GUY.

01:25:31.925 --> 01:25:33.791
HEY, HANNAH,
YOU GOT A SECOND?

01:25:33.793 --> 01:25:35.726
NO, ROB,
I'M LATE TO A MEETING.

01:25:35.728 --> 01:25:38.662
- WE NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.
- WHAT?

01:25:38.664 --> 01:25:41.665
- IT'S ABOUT YOUR BOYFRIEND.
- I DON'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

01:25:41.667 --> 01:25:44.600
DID YOU EVER SET UP
AN ACCOUNT ON "JUNGLE"?

01:25:44.602 --> 01:25:45.968
- NO.
- WHY NOT?

01:25:45.970 --> 01:25:47.470
BECAUSE IT'S DISGUSTING.

01:25:47.472 --> 01:25:48.905
OH, I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU.

01:25:48.907 --> 01:25:51.273
A REAL PERV
MUST'VE DREAMT THAT UP.

01:25:51.275 --> 01:25:53.275
YEAH, LANCE DREAMT IT UP.

01:25:53.277 --> 01:25:55.644
WHOA, OKAY, YOU ACTUALLY
THINK THAT I HAVE THE SKILLS

01:25:55.646 --> 01:25:57.479
TO CREATE AN APP
LIKE JUNGLE?

01:25:57.481 --> 01:25:58.914
I DON'T THINK
YOU HAVE THE SKILLS

01:25:58.916 --> 01:26:00.649
TO OPEN A BAG
OF POTATO CHIPS

01:26:00.651 --> 01:26:02.450
WITHOUT FRICK AND FRACK HERE
ASSISTING YOU.

01:26:02.452 --> 01:26:03.785
HONEY.

01:26:03.787 --> 01:26:05.020
IT'S HANNAH.

01:26:05.022 --> 01:26:08.558
HANNAH, JAMES DEVELOPED
"JUNGLE."

01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:11.992
NO, HE DIDN'T.

01:26:11.994 --> 01:26:14.594
EXCEPT THAT HE DID.

01:26:14.596 --> 01:26:15.628
- SO...
- WHATEVER.

01:26:15.630 --> 01:26:17.866
- COME ON.
- PEACE.

01:26:28.609 --> 01:26:31.844
COME ON, HANNAH.
JAMES IS EXPLAINING THE APP.

01:26:31.846 --> 01:26:33.645
HANNAH, WHAT'S WRONG?

01:26:33.647 --> 01:26:36.048
JAMES, ARE YOU THE CREATOR
OF "JUNGLE"?

01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:39.584
- NO.
- I'M SO RELIEVED.

01:26:39.586 --> 01:26:41.085
I'M THE CODER OF "JUNGLE."

01:26:41.087 --> 01:26:43.054
- WHAT?
- THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.

01:26:43.056 --> 01:26:45.489
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- YOU'VE BEEN STAYING AT OUR PLACE!

01:26:45.491 --> 01:26:48.925
YOU HELPED LANCE
MAKE "JUNGLE"?

01:26:48.927 --> 01:26:50.927
HANNAH, IT'S NOT
LIKE THAT.

01:26:50.929 --> 01:26:53.930
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WHO CARES,
GUYS? HE'S HELPING US NOW.

01:26:53.932 --> 01:26:55.766
- THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.
- I AGREE.

01:26:55.768 --> 01:26:57.433
I'M GONNA HELP YOU
BUILD AN APP

01:26:57.435 --> 01:27:00.536
BASED ON EVERYTHING YOU GUYS
TOLD ME YOU WANTED.

01:27:00.538 --> 01:27:02.772
JAMES, I JUST STARTED
TO TRUST YOU AGAIN.

01:27:02.774 --> 01:27:06.441
- AND THEN YOU LIE TO ME?
- I DID IT BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE WITH SOMEONE.

01:27:06.443 --> 01:27:09.410
YEAH, I CALL FOUL.
THIS IS NOT COOL, JAMES.

01:27:09.412 --> 01:27:11.813
SOMEONE CONVINCED ME THAT
IF ALL THE GUYS WERE ON THE APP,

01:27:11.815 --> 01:27:14.481
THEN ALL THE GIRLS
WOULD HAVE TO BE, TOO, BUT...

01:27:14.483 --> 01:27:16.383
BUT WHAT?

01:27:16.385 --> 01:27:20.454
THE GIRL I REALLY, REALLY LIKE
DIDN'T GO ON IT.

01:27:20.456 --> 01:27:23.023
IS THAT WHY YOU
SHUT IT DOWN?

01:27:23.025 --> 01:27:24.423
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SHUT IT DOWN, RIGHT?

01:27:24.425 --> 01:27:25.659
YES, I TOOK IT DOWN,

01:27:25.661 --> 01:27:28.628
BUT I TOOK IT DOWN

01:27:28.630 --> 01:27:30.496
'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
MY MOTHER USING IT.

01:27:30.498 --> 01:27:32.732
YOUR MOM?

01:27:32.734 --> 01:27:35.433
WHAT?

01:27:35.435 --> 01:27:37.736
TURNS OUT...

01:27:37.738 --> 01:27:40.872
CONNECTING ISN'T JUST HARD
FOR US.

01:27:40.874 --> 01:27:42.407
IT'S HARD FOR EVERYONE.

01:27:42.409 --> 01:27:45.577
SO YOU MADE "JUNGLE"
FOR LOVE.

01:27:45.579 --> 01:27:50.349
I MADE "JUNGLE" BECAUSE SOMEONE
PROMISED MY WAY TO M.I.T.

01:27:53.052 --> 01:27:56.486
AND, YES...

01:27:56.488 --> 01:27:57.589
BECAUSE I LOVE HANNAH.

01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:01.991
IF YOU DON'T KISS HIM
RIGHT NOW,

01:28:01.993 --> 01:28:04.928
- I'M GONNA ASK HIM TO MARRY ME.
- I'LL BEAT YOU TO IT.

01:28:04.930 --> 01:28:06.461
COME ON, HANNAH.
HE JUST SAID HE LOVES YOU

01:28:06.463 --> 01:28:07.697
IN FRONT OF ALL THESE GIRLS.

01:28:07.699 --> 01:28:10.068
