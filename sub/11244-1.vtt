WEBVTT

02:20.598 --> 02:22.850
Mr. Lagana.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.935
I know it's late.
Wake him up.

02:26.021 --> 02:28.480
Tell him
it's Tom Duncan's widow.

02:28.565 --> 02:33.027
I'm very sorry, Mr. Lagana, but there's
an important call on the private line...

02:33.111 --> 02:35.821
a woman who says
she's Tom Duncan's widow.

02:38.116 --> 02:40.743
Widow?
That's what she said.

02:53.882 --> 02:57.217
Yes? This is Lagana.

02:59.763 --> 03:03.140
No. I'm glad you called me,
Mrs. Duncan.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.225
I appreciate it.

03:07.062 --> 03:09.396
Yes, of course
we will get together.

03:09.481 --> 03:11.940
But now I suggest you call
the police immediately.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.209
Call Vince.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.971
Mr. Lagana wants Vince Stone.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.893
It's his girl.
She says he's playing cards.

03:50.814 --> 03:54.650
This is not a social call, Debby.
Tell Vince I want him, right away.

03:54.734 --> 03:58.654
Oh, sure, Mr. Lagana. I always
like to tell Vince you're calling.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.824
I like to see him jump.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.201
Vince!

04:05.286 --> 04:07.204
It's him!

04:07.288 --> 04:09.415
Oh, pass the deal, hmm?

04:14.504 --> 04:17.380
Why don't you shut the door
and see if anybody needs a drink?

04:17.464 --> 04:21.093
Well, I don't
know about your politicians,

04:21.177 --> 04:23.554
but I'm so bored
I need one.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.641
Two.

04:29.644 --> 04:33.105
Debby! Shut the door.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.864
Yes, Mike?

04:41.948 --> 04:44.950
Well, I didn't know it was the private line
ringing, or I would have answered myself.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.538
When? When did it happen?

04:51.374 --> 04:53.125
Oh, sure, I'll see to it.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.722
Too bad you had to make the trip
out from headquarters, Sergeant.

05:06.806 --> 05:10.726
From out of bed, you mean. When a cop
kills himself, they want a full report.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.769
Did you know him?
No. Just to say hello to.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.439
He was in charge
of the record bureau.

05:15.523 --> 05:19.151
Single contact wound. Powder burn
on his temple and right hand.

05:19.277 --> 05:22.654
Suicide. No question. Tell the
wagon boys they can have him, huh?

05:22.739 --> 05:24.239
Yes.

05:25.992 --> 05:29.453
No note or anything, huh, Gus?
No. Nothing.

05:29.537 --> 05:32.456
You'd better make a list of all
this stuff for the report, huh?

05:32.540 --> 05:34.666
Right.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.252
I'm going upstairs,
have a talk with Mrs. Duncan.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.894
Please come in.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.736
Mrs. Duncan,
I won't keep you very long.

06:02.820 --> 06:05.656
You needn't apologize.
I know this is necessary.

06:05.740 --> 06:09.034
Please sit down.
Thank you.

06:09.118 --> 06:13.372
My name is David Bannion.
I... I knew your husband slightly.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.708
Tom had many friends.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.961
Would you mind telling me
what happened?

06:20.380 --> 06:23.215
When I first heard the shot,

06:23.299 --> 06:27.094
I was too surprised to move
for a few seconds.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.721
Then I ran downstairs.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.724
When I found him, he was...

06:32.809 --> 06:34.351
he was dead.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.896
I'm sorry I
have to ask you these questions,

06:37.981 --> 06:40.607
but they want a full report
downtown.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.943
Of course.

06:43.027 --> 06:48.073
When a policeman kills himself,
the department gets worried.

06:48.157 --> 06:50.826
Well, that depends
on the circumstances.

06:53.079 --> 06:56.248
There weren't any circumstances.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.792
Everything Tom ever did...

06:58.876 --> 07:01.920
was clean and wholesome.

07:02.005 --> 07:04.256
That's the kind of man he was.

07:04.382 --> 07:07.759
Do you know
why he took his life?

07:10.597 --> 07:15.142
Oh, it-it must have been
his health.

07:17.228 --> 07:21.106
Several times
the past few months,

07:21.190 --> 07:23.400
he complained...

07:23.484 --> 07:26.862
about a pain along his left side.

07:28.364 --> 07:31.825
When I suggested
he see the police surgeon,

07:31.909 --> 07:34.202
he'd make excuses.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.874
I think he was afraid to.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.834
Then he didn't see a doctor?

07:40.918 --> 07:43.211
Not that he ever told me.

07:44.213 --> 07:47.382
Well, you've been most helpful.

07:48.384 --> 07:51.136
Now look, if there's anything
you need, anything at all,

07:51.220 --> 07:53.221
you get in touch
with us, huh?

07:53.348 --> 07:56.933
Thank you, Mr. Bannion.
Good-bye, Mrs. Duncan.

08:04.484 --> 08:08.403
What's with dinner? How about
putting the paper down and helping?

08:09.614 --> 08:11.615
All right.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.543
What's that, steak?
Medium rare.

08:23.628 --> 08:26.505
Yeah. How you manage steaks
on my salary...

08:26.589 --> 08:29.341
You know, downtown,
they just don't believe me.

08:29.425 --> 08:33.386
- Tell them you married an heiress.
- All right.

08:33.471 --> 08:37.015
Next year, when Joyce
starts kindergarten,

08:37.100 --> 08:40.936
you're gonna have to kiss the steaks
good-bye until she finishes college.

08:41.979 --> 08:44.481
Unless you become police commissioner
in the meantime.

08:44.607 --> 08:48.568
Oh, that's inevitable.
Oh, naturally.

08:48.653 --> 08:52.197
Okay, Commissioner, you get
the stringy end of the steak.

08:54.867 --> 08:59.204
- What about Joyce? She go to bed all right?
- Just the usual tug-of-war.

08:59.288 --> 09:02.791
She had to go to the bathroom
a few times, hear three stories...

09:02.875 --> 09:05.836
and have a glass of water
before she finally went to sleep.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.548
She's angelic all day.
But at night, she's a holy terror.

09:09.632 --> 09:12.050
That's the way
I usually describe you.

09:14.011 --> 09:16.972
That's what the book says, though,
doesn't it? Be patient, but firm.

09:17.056 --> 09:21.435
The book, the book.
Very scientific and calm.

09:21.519 --> 09:25.147
Trouble is, the authors
have never met our daughter.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.775
Well, it's very simple. She's madly
in love with me. That's all.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.737
Hey, you know something? That's the
conflict between the two of you.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.197
You're both in love
with the same wonderful guy.

09:34.323 --> 09:36.825
Right? Right.
Wrong.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.454
We're just used to you.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.335
Well? How is it?

09:48.421 --> 09:50.380
It's good steak.
Thanks.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.966
You want some beer?
I'll take a sip of yours.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.594
You see? That's exactly what I mean.
It's a perfect marriage.

09:55.678 --> 09:59.765
We share the same scotch, the same
cigarette, the same can of beer.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.350
Among other things.

10:04.103 --> 10:08.231
Hey, you know something? I'm gonna drink
mine. I'm gonna take a sip of yours.

10:08.357 --> 10:11.693
That'll be something different
for a change, huh?

10:11.778 --> 10:13.945
Oh, they'll wake Joyce.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.698
Hello?

10:18.451 --> 10:20.952
Well, he's having dinner.

10:21.037 --> 10:24.706
Oh. It's Sergeant Kahn.

10:27.210 --> 10:30.128
Hello, Marty. Ye...

10:30.213 --> 10:32.506
What?

10:32.590 --> 10:35.133
Who says Duncan
didn't kill himself?

10:35.218 --> 10:38.720
I saw the body, Marty. There's no
question about it being suicide.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.558
All right, what's her name?

10:50.149 --> 10:52.317
All right, I'll go see her.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.081
Lucy Chapman around?

11:10.044 --> 11:12.420
The last stool on the other end.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.886
Lucy Chapman?

11:20.012 --> 11:22.681
Yeah.
I'm Bannion, Homicide.

11:22.765 --> 11:27.644
Oh. With this band playing, you
need megaphones to talk at the bar.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.605
We can sit in a booth.
All right.

11:41.617 --> 11:44.744
Okay, what is this
information you have?

11:44.829 --> 11:48.874
This story's all wrong, Mr. Bannion.
Why, Tom wouldn't kill himself.

11:48.958 --> 11:52.168
He wasn't worried about his health,
not for a single minute.

11:52.295 --> 11:57.048
No? Then what was he worried about?
Nothing. Nothing at all.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.551
Not after his wife
agreed to divorce him.

12:01.804 --> 12:05.348
Duncan told you he was getting a divorce?
He talked about nothing else.

12:05.474 --> 12:09.019
When was this? Night before last.
My night off.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.730
What'll it be, folks? You
don't have to order anything.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.190
That's all right. I'll have a beer.
What about you?

12:14.275 --> 12:16.568
Only when I'm working.

12:20.489 --> 12:24.993
- How'd you get to know Duncan?
- Well, I... I met him a year ago.

12:25.077 --> 12:28.788
A year last May 11,
down in Lakeside.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.916
Tom owned a summer place there.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.336
I liked him right away.

12:34.420 --> 12:38.632
He was a real wonderful guy, Mr.
Bannion. Nice and gentle.

12:40.509 --> 12:42.844
Thirty-five, mister.
Pay now.

12:45.348 --> 12:47.849
Keep it.
Thank you.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.647
Tom used to come
to the club every night.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.024
His wife traveled a lot.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.319
Sometimes, when she was away, I...

12:59.403 --> 13:01.488
I used to go to the house.

13:01.614 --> 13:06.368
We'd go swimming and then lie around
in the sun. That sounds very cozy.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.495
Oh, it wasn't that way, Mr. Bannion.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.997
Oh, sure. Sure.

13:11.082 --> 13:13.416
Please. Please, you've got to believe that.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.669
You've got to understand
how things were with Tom.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.504
How he was caught
between the two of us.

13:17.588 --> 13:20.840
Between me and that...
that leech he was married to.

13:20.925 --> 13:24.469
What's your pitch, Lucy? You
trying to use us for a shakedown?

13:24.553 --> 13:27.013
Shakedown?

13:27.098 --> 13:29.182
Me?

13:33.604 --> 13:36.189
Sure. I understand.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.941
You're covering up
for a cop's widow.

13:38.025 --> 13:40.402
You don't want to find out
anything that'll change her story.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.863
- I want to find out facts.
- Oh, in a pig's eye you want facts!

13:43.948 --> 13:47.033
The only difference between me and Bertha
Duncan is that I work at being a B-girl...

13:47.159 --> 13:49.536
and she has a wedding ring and a
marriage certificate. That'll be all.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.122
Maybe for you. I can still
talk to the newspapers.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.666
Yeah, I know. You can talk
yourself into a lot of trouble.

13:54.750 --> 13:58.003
So what?
At least I'll show she's a liar.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.588
Tom had no reason
to kill himself.

14:00.673 --> 14:04.175
The fact is, he did kill himself.
And that's positive.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.731
Can I have a brandy?

14:19.608 --> 14:22.694
She claims that she saw
your husband a few nights ago...

14:22.778 --> 14:26.573
Wednesday night... and there was
nothing wrong with his health.

14:28.701 --> 14:32.037
What are you trying to say,
Mr. Bannion?

14:32.121 --> 14:35.999
I'm... just trying
to check up on her story,

14:36.083 --> 14:38.752
find out why your husband
took his life.

14:38.836 --> 14:44.132
Maybe I've been trying too hard to keep our
dirty family linen from being washed in public.

14:45.468 --> 14:48.803
I suppose that woman told you
about their relationship?

14:51.974 --> 14:56.519
She said your husband was in good
health and very cheerful, Mrs. Duncan,

14:56.604 --> 14:58.563
and that you'd agreed
to divorce him.

14:58.647 --> 15:02.358
She's a liar.
Tom never wanted a divorce.

15:02.443 --> 15:05.528
And he wasn't a well man.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.947
I have no choice now...

15:08.032 --> 15:10.742
except to tell you
about Tom and myself.

15:12.286 --> 15:17.248
In the years we were married,
there were four Lucy Chapmans.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.250
Four that I found out about.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.836
Tom was vain.

15:21.921 --> 15:26.424
He had to prove to himself
that he was still attractive to women.

15:26.509 --> 15:30.345
Maybe he did boast to that woman
that he was in good health.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.806
What else would you
expect him to do?

15:36.685 --> 15:39.104
I wish this visit
hadn't been necessary.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.898
There's a chance Lucy Chapman
might try a little blackmail.

15:41.982 --> 15:44.901
She knows that you own
that house at Lakeside.

15:44.985 --> 15:47.320
Probably thinks you're wealthy.

15:47.404 --> 15:51.658
A wealthy policeman
would be a novelty.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.912
Thank you for your patience,
Mr. Bannion.

15:55.996 --> 15:58.581
There's just one small thing
I'd like to clear up,

15:58.666 --> 16:01.251
you know,
so there'll be no loose ends.

16:01.377 --> 16:04.754
Of course. Would you mind telling
me about the house at Lakeside?

16:04.839 --> 16:09.175
When it was bought, the price that
was paid, small details like that.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.177
I'd mind very much!

16:11.262 --> 16:14.097
For Tom's sake, I resent the
implication of your questions.

16:14.181 --> 16:16.975
Look, Mrs. Duncan,
there was no implication.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.228
Lucy Chapman
may run to the newspapers,

16:20.312 --> 16:23.773
and it's my job to have the material to
offset any insinuations that she might make.

16:23.858 --> 16:25.942
And it's my job,
with Tom dead and defenseless,

16:26.026 --> 16:28.570
to preserve his good name
the best way I can.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.697
Good night, Mr. Bannion.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.076
Good night.

17:03.105 --> 17:05.898
Okay. So long.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.443
Here you are, sir.

17:40.100 --> 17:43.144
Trouble automatically
catches up with girls like her.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.941
Looks like a sex crime to me.
You said she wasn't attacked.

17:48.025 --> 17:51.027
Well, that's not unusual
in this type case.

17:51.111 --> 17:54.072
I'd say pretty definitely
it was psychopathic.

17:54.198 --> 17:58.201
You saw those cigarette burns on her body.
Yeah, I saw them.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.996
Every single one of them.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.415
What's that name again,
Sergeant?

18:04.500 --> 18:07.502
Miss Chapman.
Lucy Chapman.

18:13.259 --> 18:16.552
The lieutenant's been
buzzing you every 10 minutes.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.930
He didn't say what for.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.274
Sit down, Dave.

18:31.026 --> 18:33.653
I had a call from upstairs.

18:33.779 --> 18:37.448
What have you been bothering Mrs.
Duncan about? Just routine.

18:37.533 --> 18:41.119
Well, the first time was,
not the second visit.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.788
Did she complain?

18:43.872 --> 18:45.623
Somebody did.

18:46.959 --> 18:50.920
It was bad judgment to bother a cop's
widow about the love life of her husband.

18:51.005 --> 18:54.090
- Good or bad, it was my judgment.
- You're missing the point.

18:54.174 --> 18:56.634
I'm the one that gets
the pressure calls from upstairs.

18:56.719 --> 18:59.095
I'm the one that has to explain.

18:59.179 --> 19:02.265
You don't keep an office like this
very long stepping on a lot of corns.

19:02.349 --> 19:04.976
You want me to go upstairs
and explain?

19:05.060 --> 19:09.814
Not you.
You're a corn-stepper by instinct.

19:09.898 --> 19:13.276
No, all I'm asking you to do,
and I'm not even ordering it, Dave...

19:13.360 --> 19:15.862
stop bothering Mrs. Duncan.

19:15.946 --> 19:19.157
I don't want to jam you up, Ted,
but I may have to see her once more.

19:19.241 --> 19:23.202
Why? You have any doubt
Duncan killed himself?

19:23.287 --> 19:26.289
No. No, none at all.

19:26.415 --> 19:30.084
I just got back from the county morgue.
Hmm, the barfly?

19:30.169 --> 19:32.545
I read the Teletype
about your identification.

19:32.671 --> 19:35.840
Lucy Chapman used to be Duncan's
girlfriend. And the army's and navy's.

19:35.924 --> 19:40.178
Yeah, maybe so. She talks to me just
once and, like that, she's dead.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.889
That's County Homicide's headache.

19:42.973 --> 19:45.016
Let's worry about this office.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.268
We're spilling over
with unfinished business.

19:48.771 --> 19:52.273
Lucy Chapman was probably trying to shake
down some sucker who wouldn't shake.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.276
When barflies get killed, it's for
any one of a dozen crummy reasons.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.070
You know that.

19:57.154 --> 20:00.031
Let the Sheriff's Office
sort out this jigsaw.

20:00.115 --> 20:04.410
Meanwhile, we'll stop
pestering the widow. Okay?

20:08.457 --> 20:10.375
You still asking?

20:10.459 --> 20:13.961
No more. I'm telling you.

20:23.514 --> 20:26.474
First I know Lucy's quitting
is about 2:00 in the morning.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.352
She comes to me
and asks to be paid off.

20:29.478 --> 20:32.563
Did she say why?
I don't ask.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.650
All any of these dames owe me is a
night's work, one night at a time.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.610
They come and go like flies.

20:37.694 --> 20:40.071
Only this fly
got herself strangled.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.573
These things happen, Sergeant.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.618
Outside of my place, some of these
babes keep pretty shady company.

20:45.702 --> 20:49.247
It figures. They know nobody
cares much what happens to them.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.457
Did she have any close friends
among the other girls here?

20:51.583 --> 20:54.585
They don't stay long enough to
make friends. Where did she live?

20:54.670 --> 20:57.755
If I ask for an address, they lie.
It's not worth the bother.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.590
They're floaters.

20:59.675 --> 21:03.094
Not much more than a suitcase full of
nothing between them and the gutter.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.846
Hey, you know something?

21:04.930 --> 21:07.098
You ought to be doing
radio commercials.

21:07.182 --> 21:08.850
How to talk a lot
and say nothing.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.477
Why, I'd be tickled to help
if I could.

21:11.562 --> 21:13.646
Sure.

21:13.730 --> 21:16.441
When I get some answers,
I'll be back.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.818
Glad to see you anytime, Sergeant.

21:52.227 --> 21:55.688
This is Tierney.
Tell him it's important.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.860
Sorry to bother you.
Bannion just left here.

22:01.904 --> 22:04.363
No, sir. I just gave him
a lot of double-talk.

22:04.448 --> 22:09.035
He said he'd be back again.
Yes, sir. I will.

22:14.249 --> 22:16.375
Okay, buster, who'd you call?

22:17.419 --> 22:18.961
My mother.

22:21.256 --> 22:26.260
Would you rather go downtown to answer
the questions? Don't scare me, Sergeant.

22:26.345 --> 22:29.639
Five minutes after we get downtown,
you'll be answering the questions.

22:29.765 --> 22:31.849
Get your coat.
Sure.

22:31.934 --> 22:35.436
Only somebody will want to know
why you're butting into a county case,

22:35.521 --> 22:39.649
why you don't stop annoying people,
especially after you've been told once.

22:39.775 --> 22:43.653
You get your news fast, don't you?
Special carrier pigeon.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.323
Do we still go downtown?

22:47.407 --> 22:49.742
No. Not today.
When we do,

22:49.826 --> 22:52.703
I'll have enough answers
to close this joint up.

22:52.788 --> 22:55.039
Tell that to your mother.

23:56.268 --> 23:59.812
Oh, that's the most beautiful castle
in the whole world.

23:59.896 --> 24:02.607
It's a police station, Daddy.
Just like yours.

24:02.691 --> 24:05.568
Hello, little bossy. Where's
big bossy, huh? Here.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.737
Hello, darling.
Hello.

24:09.072 --> 24:11.866
What's... Look at this.
Expecting company or something?

24:11.950 --> 24:14.118
Al and Marge
are coming to dinner.

24:14.244 --> 24:17.580
Come, Daddy. Help me build the roof.
You'd better shower.

24:17.706 --> 24:20.416
And get some cocktails ready.
Yeah.

24:32.179 --> 24:35.556
You look down in the dumps.
It's nothing much.

24:35.641 --> 24:38.142
Is it a case?
I told you, it's nothing.

24:38.226 --> 24:41.562
You'll have to use a different tone
if you expect me to believe that.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.649
All right, I'll bring home an
affidavit tomorrow if... I'm sorry.

24:46.276 --> 24:50.154
- I'm sorry, baby.
- It's all right.

24:50.238 --> 24:52.907
You're entitled to let off steam.

24:52.991 --> 24:55.993
Ah, it's just a letdown.

24:56.078 --> 25:00.539
I don't know, I guess it's a kind of
an occupational disease with cops.

25:02.042 --> 25:05.002
You know that girl that phoned,
that Lucy Chapman? Mm-hmm.

25:06.421 --> 25:10.216
Well, she's a case now.
County homicide.

25:12.928 --> 25:15.888
I'm sorry, darling.
I'm...

25:15.972 --> 25:19.225
It's all right, darling. Daddy will
help you build even a bigger one.

25:19.309 --> 25:22.687
Oh. Let's
go see who's phoning us.

25:22.771 --> 25:25.439
Can I talk?
Of course.

25:27.484 --> 25:30.403
Hello?

25:30.487 --> 25:32.697
Yes, it is.

25:34.991 --> 25:37.243
Who is this?

25:38.537 --> 25:40.538
He wants you.

25:41.623 --> 25:45.543
Who is it?
I... I don't know.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.881
This is Dave Bannion.

25:50.966 --> 25:56.053
Listen, slob. Stop minding other people's
business if you want to stay alive.

25:56.138 --> 25:59.098
Some big people
are getting annoyed.

25:59.182 --> 26:01.434
Who is this?

26:04.438 --> 26:06.522
What did he say to you?

26:06.606 --> 26:09.734
You can fill in the four-letter words
better than I can.

26:09.818 --> 26:12.236
Honey, I'll try to be back
before Al and Marge leave.

26:12.320 --> 26:15.698
But, Dave, you don't
even know who called.

26:15.782 --> 26:19.493
No, it's just another part of the scheme
to make me crawl back in my shell.

26:19.578 --> 26:23.497
I don't know who called. But I
know where to go to find out.

26:47.230 --> 26:51.525
Just a moment. Who do you want to see?
Mike Lagana.

26:53.445 --> 26:57.281
Oh, sorry. I didn't recognize you, Sergeant.
How many men on this detail, Officer?

26:57.365 --> 27:00.284
Three of us on the day and night shift
and four after midnight.

27:00.368 --> 27:03.078
Ten cops to watch over
Mike Lagana.

27:03.163 --> 27:06.123
One hundred bucks a day
of the taxpayers' money.

27:06.208 --> 27:09.627
Well, Mr. Lagana kind of runs things.
I guess that's no secret.

27:09.711 --> 27:12.213
No. That's no secret at all.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.800
You like this detail?
I do what I'm told.

27:15.884 --> 27:18.719
Yeah. That's what we're all
supposed to do, isn't it?

27:33.527 --> 27:36.487
Good evening, sir. I'm from the
police department. Is Mr. Lagana in?

27:36.571 --> 27:38.489
I'll see, sir.

27:38.573 --> 27:41.283
It's a little drafty outside.

27:44.871 --> 27:46.831
Please wait.

27:59.553 --> 28:01.679
This way, Officer.

28:01.763 --> 28:05.432
I promised my daughter her father
won't be seen or heard tonight.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.352
What's your name again?
I think the butler missed it.

28:08.436 --> 28:11.355
Bannion. Dave Bannion.
I'm from Homicide.

28:11.439 --> 28:13.607
I think I've heard of you.

28:22.117 --> 28:23.909
My mother.

28:25.662 --> 28:30.165
A great old lady. They broke
the mold when they made her.

28:32.544 --> 28:35.588
She died last May.

28:35.672 --> 28:38.048
She lived here with me.

28:38.133 --> 28:41.594
Had her own suite of rooms.
Her own bath. Everything.

28:41.678 --> 28:46.557
Never got over being
surprised about my success.

28:46.641 --> 28:49.268
You didn't come here
to listen to me.

28:49.352 --> 28:54.648
Well, what is it this time? Benefit dance?
Pension fund drive?

28:54.733 --> 28:57.151
I came about a murder.

29:00.155 --> 29:02.656
You came here to my home
about a murder?

29:02.741 --> 29:07.244
A girl named Lucy Chapman was
murdered last night. Or this morning.

29:09.915 --> 29:13.876
First she was tortured, then strangled.
Who runs your department?

29:14.002 --> 29:17.588
It's Lieutenant Wilks.
Mm-hmm. Wilks, huh?

29:17.672 --> 29:20.299
Yeah, it was an old-fashioned killing.
Prohibition kind.

29:20.425 --> 29:23.677
That's why I thought you might...
I don't care what you thought.

29:23.762 --> 29:27.139
I'm glad to help you boys
whenever I can.

29:27.223 --> 29:29.600
But I got an office
for that sort of thing.

29:29.684 --> 29:33.395
This is my home. And I don't
like dirt tracked into it.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.314
I see.

29:35.398 --> 29:38.984
And I violated your immaculate home,
is that it?

29:39.069 --> 29:40.861
That's exactly it.

29:42.864 --> 29:45.616
And tomorrow morning, I'll see you
don't get the chance to do it again.

29:45.700 --> 29:49.662
What'll you do... make another phone
call, or have somebody make it for you?

29:49.746 --> 29:52.373
I've seen some dummies
in my time,

29:52.457 --> 29:54.541
but you're in a class by yourself.

29:54.626 --> 29:57.086
I'm stupid because I want some
answers about a murder. Is that it?

29:57.212 --> 30:01.632
Shut up and get out. We don't talk about
those things in this house, do we?

30:01.716 --> 30:04.760
No, it's too elegant,
too respectable.

30:04.844 --> 30:07.304
Nice kids. Party.

30:07.389 --> 30:10.182
Painting of Mama
up there on the wall, huh?

30:10.266 --> 30:12.851
No place for a stinking cop.

30:12.936 --> 30:16.939
It's only a place for a hoodlum who built this
house out of 20 years of corruption and murder.

30:17.023 --> 30:18.440
I'm gonna tell you something.

30:18.525 --> 30:21.986
You couldn't plant enough flowers
around here to kill the smell.

30:22.112 --> 30:26.532
I warned you to get out.
Cops have homes too.

30:26.616 --> 30:28.701
Only sometimes there isn't
enough money to pay the rent...

30:28.785 --> 30:31.203
because a cop gets hounded off the
force by your thieving cockroaches...

30:31.329 --> 30:33.706
for trying to do an honest job.
George!

30:33.790 --> 30:35.833
What's the matter? You think I
live under a rock or something?

30:35.917 --> 30:38.961
Your creeps have no compunction about
phoning my house, giving me orders,

30:39.087 --> 30:42.006
talking to my wife like she
was a dirty- Yes, sir?

30:42.090 --> 30:44.967
Get rid of him.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.803
Let's go, mister.
Take your hand off, George.

30:47.887 --> 30:50.556
It comes off
when we get to your car.

31:01.693 --> 31:04.278
Better not, George.

31:05.947 --> 31:08.782
You want to pinch-hit
for your boy, Lagana?

31:22.672 --> 31:25.632
What makes you think you can walk into
Lagana's house and slug his bodyguard?

31:25.717 --> 31:28.177
You're no rookie. You've been
around long enough to know better.

31:28.261 --> 31:30.679
I'm not asking you to take the rap for me.
I'll stand up for what I do.

31:30.764 --> 31:33.724
Big, fancy words.
Well, I'm in no mood for them.

31:33.808 --> 31:35.934
I'm the one getting
the squeeze from upstairs.

31:36.019 --> 31:39.021
What am I supposed to do when some cop-hater
phones my home and insults my wife...

31:39.105 --> 31:41.231
sit home and like it?

31:41.316 --> 31:44.568
Are you trying to tell me
Lagana phoned your house?

31:44.652 --> 31:48.405
I'm trying to tell you that nothing dirty
happens in this city without Lagana's okay.

31:48.490 --> 31:52.493
I'm not interested in your theories.
Not when they affect my job.

31:52.577 --> 31:56.747
You're just begging to go back into
uniform, pounding a beat out in the sticks.

31:56.831 --> 32:00.084
That Lucy Chapman killing
is a county squeal.

32:00.168 --> 32:02.920
It's the sheriff's headache, not ours.

32:03.004 --> 32:05.672
Now I told you that once,
and I'm telling you again.

32:07.675 --> 32:09.593
I won't tell you a third time.

32:11.262 --> 32:13.347
That'll be all, Sergeant.

32:24.442 --> 32:27.277
Let the pans soak. I'll scour
them when we come back.

32:27.362 --> 32:30.280
The main feature doesn't start
for about an hour.

32:31.491 --> 32:34.284
Do you mind if I put
my two cents in?

32:34.369 --> 32:36.286
No, honey, I don't mind.

32:36.371 --> 32:39.039
I've been thinking about
Lieutenant Wilks.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.292
That leaning tower of jelly.

32:42.377 --> 32:45.546
You know how long he and his wife
have looked forward to retirement.

32:45.630 --> 32:49.133
We've done it ourselves when
we've looked that far ahead.

32:49.217 --> 32:53.971
Wilks only has a few more years to go.
He's worried about his pension.

32:54.055 --> 32:57.349
If I'd had any sense,
I'd have turned in my badge.

32:57.433 --> 33:01.270
Your big trouble, honey, is that
you attack yourself from all sides,

33:01.354 --> 33:03.272
like Jersey mosquitoes.

33:03.356 --> 33:05.649
You don't want to quit the
department, not for one minute.

33:05.733 --> 33:09.403
What am I supposed to do... hold on
to my job by just stringing along?

33:09.487 --> 33:11.613
Afraid to look to the left
or to the right...

33:11.698 --> 33:13.991
because I might see something
that they don't want me to see?

33:14.075 --> 33:16.827
If you do, you're gonna
have trouble from me.

33:16.911 --> 33:19.913
Just keep leading with your chin
and don't you compromise.

33:19.998 --> 33:24.585
That's what I wanted to hear you say.
Thanks, inspector.

33:25.753 --> 33:28.005
Honey.
Hmm?

33:28.089 --> 33:30.674
If I tell you something,
you won't laugh?

33:30.758 --> 33:32.801
No, I won't laugh.

33:32.886 --> 33:34.928
I love you.

33:41.769 --> 33:43.979
See, I'm not laughing.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.735
Oh, let's stay home, huh?

33:51.821 --> 33:54.031
We're having company.

33:54.115 --> 33:56.366
I can't sleep.

33:56.451 --> 33:59.411
Nonsense, Miss Bannion.
You trot right back to bed.

33:59.495 --> 34:01.914
Hey. The thing for you to do
now, according to the book,

34:01.998 --> 34:05.000
is to lead her to B-E-D with great
kindness and great firmness.

34:05.126 --> 34:08.337
Let's go. Suppose you try it. I'll
drive over and get the sitter.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.380
Who'd you get?
Maxine.

34:10.465 --> 34:13.675
Tell her not to bring half the high school
along to keep her company this time.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.386
Hey, little girls like you...

34:16.471 --> 34:18.554
should be sleeping
right about now.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.849
Tell me a story.

34:20.975 --> 34:25.187
In bed, darling. In bed.
Which story, Daddy?

34:25.271 --> 34:28.899
Well, let's see. How about,
uh, the Three Little Kittens?

34:29.025 --> 34:32.319
- That lost their mittens.
- Commissioner.

34:32.402 --> 34:35.447
I need the car keys.

34:36.991 --> 34:39.784
Here you are. Hey!

34:39.869 --> 34:44.081
Nothing. Nothing at all.
Be back in a minute.

34:44.165 --> 34:47.083
Right.
Go on, Daddy.

34:47.168 --> 34:50.379
In bed first, darling.
Here we go.

34:51.922 --> 34:55.717
The three little kittens that
lost their mittens. Go on, Daddy.

34:55.802 --> 34:59.221
All right. The three little kittens,
uh, they lost their mittens.

34:59.305 --> 35:02.391
And they began to cry, and,
oh, they had a terrible time.

35:02.517 --> 35:05.560
And their mother came home, and she
said, "Oh, my!

35:05.687 --> 35:08.814
You-you kittens, you've lost your "...

35:08.898 --> 35:11.024
Stay in bed, darling.

35:36.884 --> 35:38.885
Katie.

35:48.229 --> 35:50.147
Yes? Bannion's
here, Commissioner.

35:50.231 --> 35:52.149
Have him come right in.

35:52.233 --> 35:54.818
I have a lot of work waiting for
me in my office, Commissioner.

35:54.902 --> 35:58.405
Well, let it wait. Your being here
will make Bannion more comfortable.

36:00.158 --> 36:03.035
I didn't get the opportunity
to speak to you at the funeral, Sergeant,

36:03.119 --> 36:05.787
to tell you how hard
your tragedy has hit us all.

36:05.872 --> 36:08.415
Uh, sit down, will you?

36:08.499 --> 36:11.626
I've put an around-the-clock
detail at your in-laws' house.

36:11.753 --> 36:15.464
The report says that's where your
child is staying. That's right.

36:15.548 --> 36:18.342
Yes, it pays to play it safe.

36:18.426 --> 36:20.802
How is the little girl?

36:20.928 --> 36:25.390
She thinks her mother went on a trip.

36:29.270 --> 36:31.563
Is there anything else we can do?

36:31.647 --> 36:36.693
Maybe a loan from the fund to tide you over
this period? Don't hesitate, Sergeant.

36:36.778 --> 36:39.112
Find out who planted
the dynamite in my car.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.615
That's item one
on the department's agenda.

36:41.699 --> 36:44.534
I've ordered Wilks
to shove everything else aside.

36:44.619 --> 36:47.662
I want this case broken
if it takes a hundred men to do it.

36:47.789 --> 36:52.501
We're checking back on every
homicide you've handled. Why?

36:52.585 --> 36:54.419
I beg your pardon?

36:54.504 --> 36:57.464
I asked you why are you
checking the files?

36:57.548 --> 37:00.008
Well, you've made
a lot of enemies, Bannion.

37:00.093 --> 37:03.136
Relatives and friends of killers
you sent to the chair.

37:03.221 --> 37:06.473
The motive was revenge.
That's obvious.

37:06.557 --> 37:08.475
Is that the way
it looks to you too, Lieutenant?

37:10.436 --> 37:12.396
Well, it's worth exploring.

37:12.480 --> 37:15.524
Of course,
I'm only an appointed official.

37:15.608 --> 37:17.901
I haven't the training
and experience you men have.

37:17.985 --> 37:21.613
But I am certain we'll find the answer
in one of these old homicides.

37:21.697 --> 37:25.867
Wilks has eight men on it full time.
Don't worry, there'll be a payoff.

37:25.993 --> 37:28.954
When? It's natural for
you to be impatient.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.665
But these things take time.
Sometimes they take forever.

37:31.749 --> 37:33.917
Now that's no way to talk.

37:34.001 --> 37:36.294
Why, there isn't a man
in the entire department...

37:36.379 --> 37:38.505
wouldn't give a month's pay
to break this case.

37:40.007 --> 37:43.176
What about you, Commissioner?
How much would you give?

37:44.512 --> 37:46.304
Just what are you inferring, Sergeant?

37:46.431 --> 37:49.433
I'm asking how much would you give, besides
a lot of phony stories to the newspapers...

37:49.517 --> 37:51.601
a pat on the back
and a few kind words for me?

37:51.686 --> 37:53.437
Why don't we go to my office and talk?

37:53.521 --> 37:56.106
Oh, look, Dave, you've got to ease up.
Take a few days off.

37:56.232 --> 38:00.402
I'll keep you informed. You? Why,
you frightened excuse for a cop.

38:00.528 --> 38:03.071
Now just a minute, Bannion. Why don't
you trot on down to your office...

38:03.156 --> 38:05.073
and wait for him
to call your orders.

38:05.158 --> 38:08.702
He'll phone you just as soon as he
gets his orders from Mike Lagana.

38:08.786 --> 38:11.705
I don't want to exert
the authority of my office.

38:11.789 --> 38:13.790
I prefer remembering that
you've been through a lot.

38:13.875 --> 38:17.210
And I'm going to give you
good reason to never forget it.

38:17.295 --> 38:20.964
- You're under suspension!
- You better check with Lagana first.

38:21.048 --> 38:24.634
- He might not approve.
- I'll have your badge and gun...

38:24.719 --> 38:26.470
now!

38:27.930 --> 38:31.766
You can have it...
permanently.

38:31.851 --> 38:34.853
One moment.

38:34.937 --> 38:36.855
I asked for your gun too.

38:36.939 --> 38:41.902
That doesn't belong to the department.
It's mine, bought and paid for.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.448
I'm warning you officially.

38:46.532 --> 38:48.700
Don't try to use it.

38:48.784 --> 38:50.285
I won't.

38:51.412 --> 38:54.664
Not until I catch up with the people
who murdered my wife.

39:02.507 --> 39:06.510
Hold it a minute. Take this along, too,
will you, please?

39:08.679 --> 39:10.889
The carriage for the truck?
No, that's...

39:10.973 --> 39:13.517
They'll bill you quarterly on the
storage charges, Mr. Bannion.

39:13.601 --> 39:15.727
Yeah, I know.
Thanks a lot.

39:19.815 --> 39:21.942
Dave?

39:26.864 --> 39:28.949
I was just leaving.

39:29.033 --> 39:31.368
Let the cab go.
I'll give you a lift.

39:31.452 --> 39:33.537
I prefer the cab, thank you.

39:36.541 --> 39:39.167
Taxi.
I just left Wilks.

39:39.252 --> 39:42.379
He said any off-the-record
help you need is yours.

39:42.463 --> 39:45.090
He feels lousy
about what happened.

39:45.174 --> 39:47.425
Put this carriage in the
cab, will you, please?

39:49.220 --> 39:52.556
Wilks gave me a list of mechanics with
records. He got them from the Bomb Squad.

39:52.682 --> 39:55.559
I have a list.
Wilks didn't know that.

39:55.643 --> 39:58.270
Tell him to stop bleeding for me.
It'll run all over his pension.

39:58.354 --> 40:01.523
You're way off base, Dave.
You don't really know Wilks.

40:01.607 --> 40:03.733
I don't want to know him.

40:05.152 --> 40:08.530
Look, I've had a bellyful
of the department and Wilks.

40:09.532 --> 40:11.449
And you.

40:13.119 --> 40:17.622
Dave, I wish you'd see
Father Masterson. Why?

40:17.707 --> 40:19.916
Because you're on a hate binge.

40:21.669 --> 40:26.381
You've decided people are all scared
rabbits and you spit on them.

40:26.465 --> 40:28.592
Look, I got to lock up.

40:28.676 --> 40:30.969
No man's an island, Dave.

40:31.053 --> 40:33.597
You can't set yourself against
the world and get away with it.

40:33.681 --> 40:35.599
Get out.

41:27.401 --> 41:30.487
Is that you, Vince?

41:30.571 --> 41:34.157
Yeah. Larry's with me.

41:34.283 --> 41:38.036
You weren't expecting somebody
else, were you? You'll do.

41:38.120 --> 41:40.330
It's better than drinking alone.

41:42.416 --> 41:44.501
Hi, Larry.
Hi, Debby.

41:44.585 --> 41:47.128
What have you
been doing all day?

41:47.254 --> 41:50.924
Shopping.
Some career, huh?

41:51.008 --> 41:56.388
Six days a week, she shops. On the
seventh, she rests. All tired out.

41:56.472 --> 41:58.223
On her, it looks good.

41:58.307 --> 42:01.935
Thanks, friend.
Go pour yourself a drink.

42:07.233 --> 42:09.192
Hey, that's nice perfume.

42:09.276 --> 42:13.154
Something new. It attracts
mosquitoes and repels men.

42:15.491 --> 42:18.326
It doesn't work that way with me.
It's not supposed to.

42:18.411 --> 42:22.247
Oh, that's His Highness.

42:22.373 --> 42:26.126
I forgot to tell you he was stopping off.
She forgot.

42:31.632 --> 42:35.635
Do you ever
go to the circus, Larry?

42:35.761 --> 42:39.139
Uh-uh. You should.
And take Vince.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.808
There's a man with a big hat
that holds up the hoop,

42:41.892 --> 42:43.810
cracks the whip
and the animals jump through.

42:43.894 --> 42:46.646
Hop, Vince! Hop, Larry!
Hop, Vince! Hop, Larry!

42:46.731 --> 42:49.023
Hop, Vince! Hop, Larry!
Hop, Vince! Hop...

42:49.150 --> 42:52.986
Putting on a vaudeville act, Debby?
Just impersonations.

42:53.070 --> 42:55.238
How's your daughter,
Mr. Lagana?

42:55.322 --> 42:57.907
- She was going out formal tonight.
- Oh.

42:57.992 --> 42:59.909
Can you imagine that?
Hmm.

42:59.994 --> 43:02.537
She wanted me to wait and put
the final okay on her dress.

43:02.621 --> 43:05.123
I told her what
I thought didn't matter.

43:05.207 --> 43:07.542
Just impress that football player.

43:07.626 --> 43:09.919
Oh, sometimes the father means
more than the football players.

43:10.004 --> 43:12.046
They come and go, but Dad's
around for keeps, hmm?

43:12.173 --> 43:14.966
I hope Angela feels that way about me.
Oh, I'll bet she does.

43:15.092 --> 43:18.511
Check the kitchen, will you, baby?
Sure.

43:20.598 --> 43:24.392
Now it's Debby. Hop, Debby! Hop, Debby!
Hop, Debby! Hop, Debby!

43:24.518 --> 43:27.771
Hop, Debby! Hop, Debby! Hop, Debby! Hop!
Hop! She's a young girl, Vince.

43:27.855 --> 43:30.148
Don't let her drink so much.

43:30.232 --> 43:32.609
If she keeps it up, she goes
out of here on her ear.

43:32.693 --> 43:34.611
She's got
no claim-check on me.

43:34.695 --> 43:37.614
When that happens, give me a ring.
I'm a rebound man from way back.

43:37.698 --> 43:40.492
I don't like gutter talk.
I'm sorry.

43:40.576 --> 43:46.206
Sorry? I'm tired of hearing you
sound off and then apologize.

43:46.290 --> 43:49.959
Vince gave you two simple contracts,
and you loused up both of them.

43:50.044 --> 43:52.378
- Oh, now wait...
- Shut up and listen!

43:52.463 --> 43:54.589
Throwing the Chapman girl
out on a county road...

43:54.673 --> 43:56.549
brought us all the advertising
we didn't want.

43:56.634 --> 44:01.638
Killing Mrs. Bannion...
how stupid can you get?

44:01.722 --> 44:03.515
How'd I know she'd be using the car?

44:03.599 --> 44:07.310
Prisons are bulging with dummies
who wonder how they got there.

44:08.896 --> 44:12.482
I can't afford people who makes mistakes.
I make myself clear?

44:12.566 --> 44:14.359
Su-sure.

44:14.443 --> 44:16.861
Vince and I have
things to talk about.

44:19.448 --> 44:23.368
I got an appointment
in half an hour with Mrs. Duncan.

44:23.452 --> 44:26.663
She's raised her salary
to 500 a week.

44:26.747 --> 44:28.915
Are we gonna pay it?

44:28.999 --> 44:31.167
You sound like Larry.

44:31.252 --> 44:35.046
As long as that letter her husband left
stays in her safe-deposit box,

44:35.130 --> 44:38.132
we'll pay what she asks.

44:39.593 --> 44:42.470
Now what about Bannion?
Running around in circles.

44:42.596 --> 44:44.138
You sure?
Positive.

44:44.223 --> 44:47.183
But if you want insurance,
uh, we can take care of him now.

44:50.062 --> 44:52.605
Vince, you worry me.

44:52.690 --> 44:56.317
We've stirred up enough headlines.
The election's too close.

44:58.070 --> 44:59.988
Things are changing
in this country, Vince.

45:00.072 --> 45:02.907
A man who can't see that
hasn't got eyes.

45:02.992 --> 45:06.035
Never get the people steamed up.
They start doing things.

45:06.120 --> 45:09.414
Grand juries, election investigations.

45:09.498 --> 45:11.875
Deportation proceedings.

45:11.959 --> 45:15.003
I don't want to land in the same ditch
with the Lucky Lucianos.

45:39.695 --> 45:41.613
Slim Farrow around?

45:44.325 --> 45:47.452
Not anymore.
Where can I reach him?

45:47.536 --> 45:51.039
Spring Rock Cemetery.
Six feet under.

45:51.123 --> 45:53.708
Died three days ago.
Bad ticker.

45:54.835 --> 45:57.712
He owe you some money?
No.

45:57.796 --> 45:59.797
I was hoping to get
some information.

45:59.882 --> 46:02.175
Then it makes no difference.

46:02.259 --> 46:04.802
Slim wouldn't give information
to his own minister,

46:04.929 --> 46:08.097
if he had a minister. Well,
maybe you can help me.

46:08.182 --> 46:10.975
My wife was murdered
10 days ago.

46:11.060 --> 46:13.478
Someone planted dynamite
in our car.

46:13.562 --> 46:15.647
You Bannion, the cop?
That's right.

46:15.773 --> 46:20.401
Was Slim mixed up in that? That's
what I'm trying to find out.

46:23.656 --> 46:26.157
Sorry. Can't help you.

46:26.241 --> 46:29.661
Well, did he have any visitors?
Did he get any phone calls?

46:29.745 --> 46:32.538
All I know about Slim
is that he's dead.

46:36.043 --> 46:38.628
Did he have a set spot to work?

46:38.712 --> 46:40.964
Uh, you know, a place
where he kept his tools?

46:41.048 --> 46:43.800
All the tools are mine.

46:44.843 --> 46:46.636
There's nothing here
for you, mister.

46:46.720 --> 46:48.888
Nothing at all.

46:50.849 --> 46:53.267
Do you mind
if I walk around the yard?

46:53.352 --> 46:55.186
Talk to your men?

46:55.270 --> 46:57.313
I have to mind.

46:57.398 --> 47:00.233
When it comes to my bread and butter,
I stay careful.

47:00.317 --> 47:03.111
It doesn't matter to you that Slim might
have been mixed up in a murder, huh?

47:03.237 --> 47:05.113
Sure, it matters.
Yeah.

47:05.239 --> 47:08.658
What can I do about it? I don't
know anything. You're a liar.

47:08.742 --> 47:13.371
You can't insult me, mister. I said I don't
know anything, and that's how it stands.

47:13.455 --> 47:17.333
You know, I've been meeting your
kind every day now for 10 years.

47:17.418 --> 47:20.211
Scared rabbits
that never see a thing.

47:21.839 --> 47:24.382
You wouldn't stick out your big,
fat neck for anybody, would you?

47:24.466 --> 47:27.010
That's the truth.
But it's my big, fat neck.

47:27.136 --> 47:30.179
So if you're through talking, I'll
get back to work. I ought to...

47:30.264 --> 47:33.725
That won't change my story.

47:33.809 --> 47:36.436
Cops are paid to take risks.
I'm not.

47:36.520 --> 47:39.397
You see, I've got
a wife and kids too.

47:47.948 --> 47:51.701
Mr. Bannion.
Mr. Bannion.

48:01.128 --> 48:03.755
Mr. Atkins might come outside.

48:03.839 --> 48:09.302
He isn't a mean man. Not many
people would hire someone like me.

48:09.386 --> 48:12.972
It's just that he's frightened.
I am too.

48:13.057 --> 48:16.517
But there was a man came to
see Slim about two weeks ago.

48:16.602 --> 48:18.936
They had a long talk
out in the yard.

48:19.021 --> 48:20.813
Do you remember
what he looked like?

48:20.898 --> 48:24.901
I'm not much good
at those things. He was...

48:24.985 --> 48:27.779
Well, he was about your height,

48:27.863 --> 48:31.157
and he... well, he wore
rather fancy clothes.

48:31.283 --> 48:34.494
You know, colorful. Would you
be able to recognize him again?

48:34.578 --> 48:37.872
Oh, yes. He came right into the office
and asked me where Slim was.

48:37.998 --> 48:40.541
How about phone calls?
A few.

48:40.626 --> 48:43.753
A man named Larry
left a message once.

48:43.879 --> 48:46.589
Just about the same time.
No last name, huh?

48:46.673 --> 48:51.636
No. He just said to tell Slim
to call him at a place...

48:51.720 --> 48:54.514
Oh, it was a peculiar name.

48:54.598 --> 48:58.726
Something like a-a monastery.
Oh, you know,

48:58.852 --> 49:02.271
where people go off alone to think.
The Retreat?

49:02.356 --> 49:05.483
That's it. He said to call him
at The Retreat.

49:07.402 --> 49:09.445
I'm very grateful, Miss...

49:09.530 --> 49:12.615
Parker. Selma Parker.

49:12.699 --> 49:16.285
Miss Parker.
You've been most helpful.

49:16.370 --> 49:19.038
Well, I'm-I'm glad.

49:19.164 --> 49:22.333
Good luck, Mr. Bannion.
Thank you.

49:33.971 --> 49:36.681
Shall we say good night to Daddy
and put baby to bed now?

49:36.765 --> 49:38.266
Yes.

49:39.351 --> 49:40.768
Good night, darling.

49:42.104 --> 49:44.272
Good night, Daddy.
Sleep tight, honey.

49:44.356 --> 49:46.274
Thanks, Marge.
You bet.

49:46.400 --> 49:48.609
- Good night, Joyce.
- Good night.

49:50.237 --> 49:53.823
Say, Al, do me a favor, will you?

49:53.907 --> 49:58.119
Call this number here
at exactly 9:30 on the dot, will you?

49:58.203 --> 50:00.663
And ask for Larry. Here.
Larry who?

50:00.747 --> 50:04.208
That's what I'm trying to find out.
"Larry" is all I know.

50:04.334 --> 50:07.753
Is it a lead?
I'm hoping so.

50:12.968 --> 50:14.886
I got my fingers crossed.

50:14.970 --> 50:16.762
Thanks, Al.

51:03.477 --> 51:05.478
Beer.

51:18.075 --> 51:20.076
Thirty-five.

51:21.328 --> 51:23.412
Retreat.

51:24.665 --> 51:26.874
Larry who?

51:26.959 --> 51:31.170
You must be kidding, mister. What am I
supposed to do, page Larry anybody?

51:35.384 --> 51:38.261
Look, keep your hands off.
I won't tell you again.

51:38.345 --> 51:40.972
I'm sorry, Mr. Stone.

51:41.056 --> 51:44.850
When I say don't pick up
the dice so fast, I mean it.

51:44.977 --> 51:48.020
I'll roll them again, if you like, huh?
Go ahead.

51:55.028 --> 51:57.822
Now stop it!

52:00.033 --> 52:02.118
Honey, that guy's way out of line.
Reds, don't fight.

52:02.202 --> 52:04.412
- I gotta go.
- Pease, Reds.

52:04.538 --> 52:06.747
Sit down, junior. Get out, kid. Get
your boyfriend out of here, sister.

52:06.873 --> 52:09.292
Come on, Reds. Let's go home.
Look, you're not scaring me.

52:09.376 --> 52:11.711
Please, Reds, come on!

52:14.631 --> 52:16.507
Where you goin', thief?

52:16.591 --> 52:19.302
This isn't your business, Bannion.

52:19.386 --> 52:23.389
All right, thief, suppose you
tell me what my business is.

52:25.767 --> 52:27.727
Go on, tell me.

52:37.904 --> 52:40.406
You like working girls over,
don't you?

52:45.662 --> 52:49.332
Don't make a mistake, Bannion.
Don't play hero with me.

52:49.416 --> 52:52.585
Maybe you're the one that
worked over Lucy Chapman.

52:57.257 --> 53:00.551
Take it easy, Sergeant. I don't
know what you're talking about.

53:00.635 --> 53:04.138
Here, baby.

53:04.264 --> 53:07.933
This is for you.
Get yourself something nice.

53:08.018 --> 53:11.187
No hard feelings, huh?
That square it, Sergeant?

53:13.690 --> 53:16.359
Get out of here
while you can still walk.

53:16.443 --> 53:19.320
Sure. Sure.

53:22.491 --> 53:24.617
You too.

53:30.791 --> 53:34.210
You going to be all right?
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

53:34.294 --> 53:37.129
 Thanks, mister.

53:38.632 --> 53:41.342
Sergeant.
Yeah?

53:41.468 --> 53:45.346
I'd like to buy you a drink.
With Vince Stone's money?

53:45.430 --> 53:47.723
I'd choke on it.

54:12.082 --> 54:16.001
Do you get your kicks out of insulting
people? Aren't you Vince Stone's girl?

54:16.086 --> 54:18.754
The way you ask it, it sounds like
a bunch of dirty words.

54:18.839 --> 54:21.048
Well, that was the general idea.

54:29.015 --> 54:31.517
Everybody's walking out
on me tonight.

54:31.643 --> 54:34.854
What are you after? I don't know.
You, I think.

54:34.938 --> 54:37.022
Vince Stone
chase you after me?

54:37.107 --> 54:39.942
You saw him leave me in the bar
like an old beer or something.

54:40.026 --> 54:43.487
Come on, let's find out.
I mean, if it's you I'm after.

54:52.205 --> 54:56.000
I'm staying at the Marland Hotel.
Okay.

54:56.126 --> 54:59.378
You make up your mind in a
hurry, don't you? Uh-huh.

55:02.382 --> 55:04.467
Marland Hotel.

55:22.736 --> 55:26.363
Say, I like this.
Early nothing.

55:31.286 --> 55:34.497
There's just scotch. Is
that all right? Fine.

55:35.957 --> 55:38.292
Water?
Good.

55:58.688 --> 56:01.857
How come you sat still
when Stone burned that girl?

56:03.485 --> 56:08.197
Well, I'll tell you. The last time
I butted in, Vince worked me over.

56:08.281 --> 56:10.324
Is that how it is
being his girl?

56:10.408 --> 56:13.327
Oh, most of the time it's a
lot of fun, expensive fun.

56:13.453 --> 56:17.623
What do you got against him?
I don't like thieves.

56:17.707 --> 56:20.084
Well, you'll never get anywhere
in this town not liking Vince.

56:20.210 --> 56:24.046
I'm not trying to get anywhere.
That's obvious.

56:24.130 --> 56:26.674
Well, that's some improvement.

56:26.758 --> 56:28.801
You know, it's funny.

56:28.885 --> 56:33.597
Sometimes, I feel about Vince
the way you looked at him tonight.

56:33.682 --> 56:36.100
He can be a pretty good guy.

56:36.184 --> 56:39.895
And then other times he can be...
But why kick?

56:39.980 --> 56:42.231
You got to take the bad
with the good.

56:42.315 --> 56:44.650
Is the good good enough?

56:46.236 --> 56:49.238
Clothes, travel, expensive excitement.
What's wrong with that?

56:49.322 --> 56:52.408
Nothing, if you don't care
where his money comes from.

56:52.492 --> 56:54.994
The main thing is to have the money.

56:55.078 --> 56:58.747
I've been rich and I've been poor.
Believe me, rich is better.

56:58.832 --> 57:02.626
Did you think I was an heiress
or something before I met Vince?

57:02.711 --> 57:05.713
- I didn't think about you at all.
- Thank you.

57:05.839 --> 57:09.341
Didn't know you. How could I?
Oh, well, that's better.

57:12.012 --> 57:14.388
You got a refill?

57:21.354 --> 57:24.898
You know Larry at The Retreat?
Larry who?

57:24.983 --> 57:28.944
Uh, it's Larry...
I forget his last name.

57:29.029 --> 57:31.864
He's about my size.
Wears flashy clothes.

57:31.948 --> 57:34.283
I know lots of Larrys.

57:34.367 --> 57:36.910
This one was a friend
ofVince Stone's.

57:36.995 --> 57:39.705
I don't know all his friends,
fortunately.

57:40.915 --> 57:42.875
You know Mike Lagana,
don't you?

57:42.959 --> 57:44.960
Just to say hello and good-bye to.
When Vince talks business,

57:45.045 --> 57:47.087
I go out and get my legs
waxed or something.

57:47.172 --> 57:50.549
I don't like to hear things. Why don't
you stop the cross-examination?

57:50.634 --> 57:52.843
I didn't come up here
to talk out of school.

57:58.975 --> 58:03.812
Why did you come up? Well, why don't
we call it research or something?

58:03.897 --> 58:06.523
Or to needle Stone, huh?

58:06.608 --> 58:09.568
Oh, well, you're about as romantic
as a pair of handcuffs.

58:09.653 --> 58:11.779
Didn't you ever tell a girl
pretty things?

58:11.863 --> 58:14.740
You know, she's got hair like the
west wind, eyes like limpid pools,

58:14.824 --> 58:16.825
skin like velvet?

58:25.794 --> 58:27.753
I'll put you in a cab.

58:27.837 --> 58:30.923
Did I say something wrong?

58:33.426 --> 58:37.096
- No.
- I must have broken one of the house rules.

58:39.432 --> 58:41.558
You really want me to go?

58:43.103 --> 58:46.939
I wouldn't touch anything ofVince
Stone's with a 10-foot pole.

58:47.023 --> 58:49.733
That's a rotten thing to say.

58:59.577 --> 59:01.829
Everybody winning?
Oh, hello, Debby.

59:01.913 --> 59:04.039
Hi, Debby.
Hi, Miss Marsh.

59:06.459 --> 59:11.255
How you doing, Vince?
Okay. Where you been?

59:11.339 --> 59:14.925
The Gaiety Club.
Late show.

59:18.221 --> 59:20.556
Deal me out a while, huh, boys?

59:25.270 --> 59:28.230
How was the show?
The usual routine, not too bad.

59:28.314 --> 59:30.232
Why didn't you
come straight home?

59:30.316 --> 59:32.860
The way you ran out,
I didn't think you cared.

59:32.986 --> 59:36.739
What do you mean, "ran out"?
It wasn't a stroll.

59:36.823 --> 59:40.075
With elections this close, I can't
afford trouble with a crazy ex-cop.

59:40.160 --> 59:45.080
He's not so crazy. Got a hot flash for you.
He hates your guts.

59:45.165 --> 59:46.832
How would you know?

59:49.085 --> 59:53.422
I was there, remember?
I'm the girl you left at the bar.

59:53.506 --> 59:57.676
I phoned The Retreat. Tierney said
you offered to buy Bannion a drink.

59:57.761 --> 01:00:01.221
Tierney wouldn't know a gag
unless it hit him right in the face.

01:00:01.347 --> 01:00:06.185
He said you followed Bannion outside.
I went out looking for you.

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:10.814
You made better time getting away
than they make in the Olympics.

01:00:10.899 --> 01:00:13.692
That's a real pretty kisser.
Isn't it?

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:17.112
I thought maybe you and Bannion played
footsie while my back was turned.

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:21.283
You ought to trade Tierney in, get
yourself a more reliable stool pigeon.

01:00:21.367 --> 01:00:23.702
Maybe I got myself
a better stoolie.

01:00:23.828 --> 01:00:26.455
How was the Gaiety Club?
No!

01:00:26.539 --> 01:00:28.290
My arm, Vince, my arm!

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:31.460
You like cops, do you?
Don't, Vince, please.

01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:33.420
Where did you go with him?
My arm, my arm!

01:00:33.546 --> 01:00:39.426
I asked you a question. Where? I only saw
him on the street, only in the street!

01:00:39.552 --> 01:00:43.388
I suggest we call it a night. I
suggest you shut your mouth.

01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:48.811
Where did you go with Bannion?
Nowhere, nowhere!

01:00:48.937 --> 01:00:52.356
He dropped me off at the Gaiety!
The Gaiety, the Gaiety!

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.942
Oh, you pig, you lying pig!

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.785
My face! My face!

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:09.289
I'll fix you and your pretty face.

01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:12.000
Don't, Vince. She's scalded.
She had it coming.

01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:14.127
Don't just stand there.
Get her to a doctor.

01:01:14.254 --> 01:01:17.673
He'll have to make a police report.
That's why we're sending you.

01:01:17.799 --> 01:01:20.092
Go on, get moving!
I'll try.

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:22.344
I'll try.

01:01:28.393 --> 01:01:30.394
Shut the door.

01:01:39.737 --> 01:01:41.530
Mike?

01:01:41.614 --> 01:01:43.657
Yes, Vince.

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:50.706
How do you know she didn't
tell Bannion anything?

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:53.792
Debby isn't your problem anymore.
She's ours.

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:56.211
I want insurance.

01:01:56.296 --> 01:01:59.756
But I don't want her found
off any county highway.

01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:01.592
I don't want her found at all.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:09.141
Who is it?
Debby Marsh.

01:02:09.267 --> 01:02:12.644
Who's with you? I'm alone.
I've been hurt.

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:35.626
Put it out. Please.

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:43.091
Vince threw hot coffee in my face.

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:45.594
I'm gonna be scarred.

01:02:45.678 --> 01:02:48.263
The whole side of my face
will be scarred.

01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:56.438
- Where's Stone now?
- I don't know.

01:02:56.522 --> 01:02:59.358
They made Higgins
take me to the doctor.

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:01.818
Higgins the police commissioner?

01:03:01.903 --> 01:03:03.403
Yeah.

01:03:05.531 --> 01:03:09.201
After the doctor put on
the bandages, I ran out.

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:13.372
Can I stay with you?
Please, can I stay?

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:17.960
I'll get you a room on this floor.

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:19.836
Who else was with Stone?

01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:25.175
Gillen from the city council, George
Fuller, Vince's lawyer and Larry Gordon.

01:03:25.259 --> 01:03:30.430
I told the doctor I didn't care what
he had to do or about the pain,

01:03:30.515 --> 01:03:32.474
only I didn't want my face scarred.

01:03:32.558 --> 01:03:34.977
Who's Larry Gordon?

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:39.648
You don't care. You don't
care what happened to me.

01:03:39.732 --> 01:03:43.151
You don't care
about anything or anybody.

01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:48.907
I was followed when I came here with you.
That's why I got this!

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:55.831
Gil, this is Dave Bannion.

01:03:55.915 --> 01:03:58.667
I'm gonna need another room
on this floor.

01:03:58.751 --> 01:04:00.919
Yeah, it's for a friend of mine.

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:04.172
Yeah. I don't want it registered.

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:07.884
Yeah. That's right. I don't want
anybody to know she's here.

01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:11.596
Right.

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.598
You'll be safe here.

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:18.395
Want a shot of scotch?
Please.

01:04:31.617 --> 01:04:34.036
Gordon is the Larry
you asked about.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.747
Vince imported him from Chicago
a few months ago.

01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:42.502
Thanks.

01:04:43.963 --> 01:04:46.798
Tomorrow, I'll have another
doctor look you over.

01:04:47.925 --> 01:04:52.971
I guess a scar isn't so bad,
not if it's only on one side.

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:58.935
I can always
go through life sideways.

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:04.733
Gordon lives
at the Wilton Apartments.

01:05:21.542 --> 01:05:23.502
Is Mrs. Davenport at home?

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:27.130
You got the wrong apartment.

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:55.617
I told you it was a...

01:05:58.204 --> 01:06:01.289
Get up.
You must be nuts.

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:03.291
Come on, get up.

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:15.512
What about Slim Farrow?

01:06:15.596 --> 01:06:17.764
You're punchy.

01:06:22.395 --> 01:06:25.105
Go on. Pick it up.

01:06:25.189 --> 01:06:27.023
I won't kill you,
not right away.

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:33.113
You got a wrong steer. If I knew
what you was talking about...

01:06:33.197 --> 01:06:34.990
What did Slim do for you?

01:06:35.074 --> 01:06:37.742
I swear on my mother's...

01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:42.622
What did he do for you?

01:06:42.707 --> 01:06:44.791
When I let go, start talking.

01:06:44.876 --> 01:06:47.669
If you don't,
I'll finish the job.

01:06:49.463 --> 01:06:52.007
Talk.

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:56.011
He told me to get you.
Vince Stone.

01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:57.888
I hired Slim.

01:06:57.972 --> 01:07:00.473
What about Lucy Chapman?

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.811
Stone. He was scared Duncan told her
things. Was Duncan on the take?

01:07:04.937 --> 01:07:08.523
Oh, yeah, for years. Why didn't
they shut up Mrs. Duncan?

01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:10.525
I don't know.

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:12.986
Did she go on the payroll?

01:07:13.112 --> 01:07:15.697
I think so. I'm not sure.
What's she got on him?

01:07:15.781 --> 01:07:19.284
I don't know.
I just take orders.

01:07:22.955 --> 01:07:26.541
You're gonna give me a break, aren't
you, Bannion? I told you what I know.

01:07:27.919 --> 01:07:31.880
I'm through with you,
but your friends aren't.

01:07:31.964 --> 01:07:34.716
I'm gonna spread the word
that you talked.

01:07:37.303 --> 01:07:40.972
You're out of business, thief.

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:50.357
We caught up with Larry
before he got to the airport.

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:53.485
He was in such a hurry, it took
a couple of slugs to stop him.

01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:56.279
What's left of him
is on the way to the river.

01:07:56.364 --> 01:07:58.365
Debby, what about her?

01:07:58.449 --> 01:08:02.744
She doesn't worry me,
but Bannion does.

01:08:02.828 --> 01:08:05.497
Larry must have talked his head off,
or he wouldn't have started running.

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:09.292
When you use second-raters like Gordon,
it's trouble. I've told you that before.

01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:14.673
If you had okayed getting rid of
Bannion, he wouldn't be a problem now.

01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:17.676
And when Duncan wanted out,
I asked you to let me handle him.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.636
But, oh, no, you thought talking
to him might keep him in line.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.305
So what happens?
He knocks himself off.

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:26.518
Don't make me the fall guy, Mike.
I'm no Larry Gordon.

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:32.983
The reformers would be delighted
to hear us accusing each other.

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:36.152
All right. We both made mistakes.
The point is correct them.

01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:40.031
Bannion on the bottom of the river with
Larry, and there's no more problem.

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:42.701
Maybe a bigger one.

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:45.620
If he knows anything,
he's put it on paper.

01:08:45.705 --> 01:08:48.331
Anything happens to him,

01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:50.750
It becomes public property.

01:08:50.835 --> 01:08:53.420
The Duncan setup all over again.

01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:55.839
That's a gamble
we've gotta take.

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:01.386
We don't.

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:09.144
Take something Bannion values more
than himself and we keep him quiet.

01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:16.818
As soon as you're set,

01:09:16.902 --> 01:09:20.488
have Higgins call off the police guard
at the Eldridge Street house.

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:26.786
Yes?

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.663
Yes, Mrs. Duncan?

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:32.042
He's at my door.
What will I do?

01:09:34.086 --> 01:09:37.171
He knows I'm at home.
My car is in the garage.

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:41.384
I'll take care of it.
You just stall him.

01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:44.220
Yes, I understand.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:10:01.112
Oh, Mr. Bannion.
I'm so sorry I kept you waiting.

01:10:08.788 --> 01:10:11.456
The furniture's the same.

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:14.376
Nothing's been changed.

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.711
You haven't started
living high yet, have you?

01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:18.713
What are you talking about?

01:10:18.798 --> 01:10:23.093
Your husband was on Lagana's payroll.
Now you are.

01:10:23.177 --> 01:10:25.637
He must have put down all the
facts and figures in writing...

01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:29.140
for Lagana to hold still for blackmail.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:31.267
What did you do with it?

01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:34.729
I haven't the faintest idea
what you're talking about.

01:10:34.814 --> 01:10:38.483
But if you want to look around,
please go right ahead.

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:43.822
No, it wouldn't be here. You're
much smarter than Lucy Chapman.

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:45.824
Thank you.

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.828
You told Lagana about Lucy.

01:10:51.831 --> 01:10:55.583
You have a horrid mind.
Poor Lucy.

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:56.918
You were delighted.

01:10:57.002 --> 01:11:00.672
You were even happy when
your husband blew his brains out.

01:11:00.756 --> 01:11:05.760
We were getting along very well
until the soul struggling began.

01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:08.221
Want to know something ridiculous?

01:11:08.305 --> 01:11:11.850
It was after his affair
with Lucy Chapman...

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:14.352
that he wanted
to turn over a new leaf.

01:11:16.897 --> 01:11:19.983
A city is being strangled
by a gang of thieves,

01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:25.113
and you protect Lagana and Stone for
the sake of a soft, plush life.

01:11:25.197 --> 01:11:28.533
The coming years are going
to be just fine, Mr. Bannion.

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:33.913
There aren't gonna be
any coming years for you.

01:11:34.039 --> 01:11:38.376
None at all.
I don't threaten easily.

01:11:40.713 --> 01:11:44.424
If anything happens to you,
the evidence comes out.

01:11:44.508 --> 01:11:48.470
That's the way you arranged it,
didn't you, bright lady?

01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:51.306
You got it all
put away someplace.

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:54.142
That's how you kept
Lagana over a barrel.

01:11:56.395 --> 01:11:58.480
But I'm not Lagana.

01:11:58.564 --> 01:12:01.524
With you dead,
the big heat follows...

01:12:01.609 --> 01:12:06.779
the big heat for Lagana, for Stone
and for all the rest of the lice.

01:12:06.906 --> 01:12:11.242
Mr. Lagana is an
excellent life insurance agent.

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:18.041
- What's the trouble?
- Why, nothing, Officer.

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:20.168
This is Police Sergeant Bannion.

01:12:20.252 --> 01:12:22.837
Sorry, Sergeant.
We got a call there was trouble.

01:12:22.922 --> 01:12:25.465
Sergeant Bannion...

01:12:25.549 --> 01:12:30.261
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's ex-sergeant, isn't it?

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:33.139
He'll be leaving with you, Officer.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.241
It's me, Bannion.

01:13:12.012 --> 01:13:14.305
How about a little
light in here?

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:17.058
I've got to get used to being
seen sometime, I guess.

01:13:32.825 --> 01:13:37.328
I've been feeling like something that's been
shut up because nobody wants to look at it.

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:41.124
Aren't you supposed to take
one of these before meals?

01:13:42.543 --> 01:13:44.127
Here you are.

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:47.505
Some water.

01:13:55.431 --> 01:14:00.602
Just sitting here thinking is pretty rough when
you've spent most of your life not thinking.

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:03.062
Eat your soup, huh?

01:14:15.534 --> 01:14:18.328
What was your wife like, Dave?

01:14:21.248 --> 01:14:23.625
Twenty-seven years old,

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:27.962
light hair, gray eyes.

01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:30.798
That's a police description.

01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:33.468
Did she like to cook,
like to be surprised?

01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:36.471
What kind of things made her laugh?
That's what...

01:14:38.766 --> 01:14:42.935
I'm sorry. You don't wanna talk
about her, certainly not with me.

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:45.730
Not with anyone.

01:14:47.691 --> 01:14:49.692
Did you find Larry?

01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:52.695
What? Yeah.

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:55.698
Yeah, I found him.

01:14:55.824 --> 01:14:59.118
And?
I ran into a brick wall...

01:14:59.244 --> 01:15:02.163
Bertha Duncan.
The cop's widow?

01:15:02.247 --> 01:15:06.125
He left her
a million-dollar trust fund.

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:08.252
Wrote down everything there was
to know about the syndicate.

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:11.964
Vince must hate her insides.

01:15:12.049 --> 01:15:14.384
He never could take
losing or being pressured.

01:15:14.468 --> 01:15:18.429
He's got to take it. If she dies,
the letter goes to the newspapers.

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:23.434
You know, I almost
killed her an hour ago.

01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:27.563
I should have.

01:15:27.648 --> 01:15:31.359
I don't believe you could.

01:15:31.443 --> 01:15:36.239
If you had, there wouldn't be much
difference between you and Vince Stone.

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:40.952
Must be for me. I told them
downstairs I was up here.

01:15:43.706 --> 01:15:46.958
Yes? Yes, Marge?

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:49.168
The relief detail
didn't show up.

01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:52.296
I called the police station. They
said they weren't coming anymore.

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:57.510
Keep the door locked till Al gets home.
I'll be there in an hour.

01:15:57.594 --> 01:16:00.388
Keep that for company.

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:18.364
Okay, mac.
Get 'em up high.

01:16:18.449 --> 01:16:21.993
Upstairs, mac,
nice and easy now.

01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:43.598
Stop, Dave. Hold it, Mark.
Come on, hold it.

01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:47.769
Nice going. This
is my brother-in-law.

01:16:49.062 --> 01:16:50.980
What is this?

01:16:51.064 --> 01:16:53.274
Al said to stop everybody.

01:16:53.358 --> 01:16:55.943
You're doing fine, Mark.
Go back downstairs.

01:16:56.028 --> 01:17:00.907
Sorry, mac.
Yeah, it's... It's okay.

01:17:01.033 --> 01:17:03.326
Is Joyce all right? Sure.
Marge has her inside.

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:07.246
I got the boys over
just in case.

01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:08.623
This is my brother-in-law.

01:17:08.707 --> 01:17:11.334
Bill Rutherford, Harry
Shoenstein, Hank O'Connel.

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.586
How are you?

01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:16.297
I guess civilian life hasn't
slowed Mark down so much, huh?

01:17:16.381 --> 01:17:19.133
You kidding? It hasn't
slowed him down at all.

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:24.889
When trouble comes, it'll be from
hoodlums who know their business.

01:17:24.973 --> 01:17:29.143
I'm afraid they won't be stopped by amateurs
whose hearts happen to be in the right place.

01:17:29.228 --> 01:17:31.813
Do we look like the cast
from some maypole dance?

01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:35.691
I've been places those creeps wouldn't
go unless they rode in a 50-ton tank.

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:39.362
I went in on foot with... The story of how
you won the Medal of Honor or something.

01:17:39.446 --> 01:17:42.532
All right, big wit, but I'm telling you,
anybody who comes through that door...

01:17:42.616 --> 01:17:45.159
and touches that kid
is gonna wind up dead.

01:17:45.244 --> 01:17:48.412
Harry Schoenhopper,
the angry poet.

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:52.792
Seriously, Bannion,
we can handle things.

01:17:52.876 --> 01:17:55.586
I was never so sure
of anything in my life.

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:57.922
Do you know where
the trouble's coming from?

01:17:59.132 --> 01:18:02.301
I'd feel easier if all of you stayed here.

01:18:02.427 --> 01:18:04.470
Daddy!
There's my girl.

01:18:04.555 --> 01:18:06.514
Hello, sweetheart.

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:12.186
How are you? Will you
tell me a story, Daddy?

01:18:12.312 --> 01:18:15.064
Why, sure. Which story, darling?
The Three Little Kittens.

01:18:15.148 --> 01:18:17.483
That lost their mittens.

01:18:29.746 --> 01:18:32.832
We just heard the precinct detail
was called off.

01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:36.377
You're sticking your neck way out.
It's a fine night for it.

01:18:38.839 --> 01:18:41.799
Hello, Dave.

01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:43.801
Aren't you throwing that pension
of yours down into the sewer?

01:18:43.886 --> 01:18:45.720
I got my wife's okay.

01:18:45.804 --> 01:18:50.016
In fact, Gertie used language
I didn't think she knew.

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:52.935
It's the first time in years
I've breathed good, clean air.

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:56.856
Well, you don't have to stay. Al has
some of his army friends upstairs.

01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:59.734
If we stick around,
it'll make it official.

01:18:59.818 --> 01:19:02.194
Thanks.
Dave.

01:19:02.321 --> 01:19:05.072
Yeah?
Where you going now?

01:19:05.157 --> 01:19:07.325
Oh, nowhere special.

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:09.327
Want company?

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:15.917
A report came in this afternoon about
your barging in on Mrs. Duncan.

01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:19.128
You're not going there again?

01:19:19.212 --> 01:19:21.172
No.

01:19:43.528 --> 01:19:47.782
I'm Vince Stone's girl... Debby Marsh.
May I see you for a moment?

01:19:47.866 --> 01:19:49.909
I was just leaving,
but please come in.

01:19:49.993 --> 01:19:52.078
Thank you.

01:19:52.162 --> 01:19:54.372
Were you in an accident?

01:19:54.498 --> 01:19:56.707
Yes.
I'm sorry.

01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:05.633
You have a nice home.
Thank you.

01:20:05.759 --> 01:20:11.138
Did Mr. Stone send you? No. I've
been thinking about you and me...

01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:13.975
how much alike we are.

01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:16.185
The mink-coated girls.

01:20:16.269 --> 01:20:20.314
I don't understand you. What
are you here for, Miss Marsh?

01:20:20.399 --> 01:20:22.316
Debby.

01:20:22.401 --> 01:20:24.819
We should use first names,
Bertha.

01:20:24.903 --> 01:20:26.821
We're sisters under the mink.

01:20:26.905 --> 01:20:31.367
You're not making
any sense, Miss Marsh.

01:20:31.451 --> 01:20:36.330
I'd better call Mr. Stone
and have him pick you up.

01:20:36.415 --> 01:20:38.833
You're not well.

01:20:38.917 --> 01:20:42.586
I never felt better in my life.

01:21:50.322 --> 01:21:55.326
It'll burn for a long time, Vince.

01:21:57.412 --> 01:21:59.413
It doesn't look bad now.

01:21:59.498 --> 01:22:03.084
But in the morning,
your face will be like mine.

01:22:03.168 --> 01:22:07.797
Look at it. It isn't pretty, is it?

01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:12.843
You'll walk through side streets and
alleys so that people won't stare at you.

01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:16.097
Oh, but you're lucky.
It won't be for long.

01:22:16.181 --> 01:22:20.017
Bertha Duncan is dead. No more
insurance for you and Lagana.

01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:23.479
The lid's off the garbage can,
and I did it.

01:22:39.913 --> 01:22:42.456
Dave.

01:22:47.546 --> 01:22:49.380
Debby.

01:22:57.389 --> 01:22:59.306
I killed Mrs. Duncan.

01:23:19.911 --> 01:23:25.416
Police emergency. Get an ambulance
at 257 Flower Street, the penthouse.

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.334
Dave!

01:23:58.366 --> 01:24:00.367
Go on, shoot!

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:05.456
Shoot, shoot!

01:24:15.133 --> 01:24:17.843
Get up.

01:24:17.928 --> 01:24:20.304
Come on, get up.

01:24:36.571 --> 01:24:38.989
We'll take your gun, Dave.

01:24:42.953 --> 01:24:44.870
You can have him too.

01:24:47.457 --> 01:24:50.334
There's one charge
against him to start with.

01:25:11.439 --> 01:25:13.524
Over there.

01:25:26.496 --> 01:25:28.414
We went to the Duncan house.

01:25:28.498 --> 01:25:31.750
I'm sorry you got there first.
I didn't.

01:25:31.835 --> 01:25:34.962
- Did you call it in?
- We wanted to catch up with you first.

01:25:35.046 --> 01:25:38.757
Put a cover on Lagana, Higgins
and every other thief in town.

01:25:38.842 --> 01:25:43.220
Duncan left a confession. It'll come
out now. The lice will try to run.

01:25:44.764 --> 01:25:47.725
There's no use moving her.

01:25:51.104 --> 01:25:54.148
Well, you can close your file
on the Bertha Duncan killing.

01:26:06.786 --> 01:26:09.580
- Dave.
- Yes.

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:13.876
Am I going to die?

01:26:16.713 --> 01:26:21.175
If I said you'd live another 100 years,
you'd call me a liar.

01:26:21.259 --> 01:26:24.178
I don't want to die.

01:26:24.262 --> 01:26:27.765
I must look awful.

01:26:30.602 --> 01:26:33.187
Vince shouldn't
have ruined my looks.

01:26:33.271 --> 01:26:35.230
It was a rotten thing to do.

01:26:40.445 --> 01:26:43.322
Dave.
Yes?

01:26:43.406 --> 01:26:45.115
I'm going to die.

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:51.789
No, Debby, no.

01:26:56.795 --> 01:26:58.837
Remember how angry you got...

01:26:58.922 --> 01:27:03.050
when... when I asked you
about your wife?

01:27:04.344 --> 01:27:06.303
I wasn't angry.

01:27:08.556 --> 01:27:10.474
You and Katie would
have gotten along fine.

01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:13.811
What was she like?

01:27:15.855 --> 01:27:20.067
A real Irish blow-top,
but she always got over it fast.

01:27:20.151 --> 01:27:23.028
She used to raise the roof
with me for missing dinner...

01:27:23.113 --> 01:27:25.406
or leaving the bathroom in a mess.

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:28.409
But a few minutes later, she'd come in
with a drink in her hand for me...

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:32.162
just as though
nothing had happened.

01:27:32.247 --> 01:27:35.332
You know, Kate,
she was a sampler.

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:40.337
She used to take sips of my drink
and puffs on my cigarette.

01:27:40.422 --> 01:27:44.133
Sometimes she used to
taste the food off my plate.

01:27:44.217 --> 01:27:46.009
We got a big kick out of that.

01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:49.847
I like her.

01:27:52.559 --> 01:27:56.186
I like her a lot.

01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:58.814
Sometimes when I came home from work,
she'd have the baby dressed up...

01:27:58.898 --> 01:28:01.650
like a... like a little princess.

01:28:01.734 --> 01:28:06.280
One of the most important parts
of the day was when I came in...

01:28:06.364 --> 01:28:10.659
and saw her looking like something
just stepped down off a birthday cake.

01:28:13.705 --> 01:28:15.956
I guess...

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:18.584
I guess it's that way
with most families.

01:28:52.785 --> 01:28:55.537
How about some coffee, Hugo?
Coming right up, Sarge.

01:28:57.957 --> 01:28:59.958
Homicide, Bannion.

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:07.508
Got it.

01:29:07.592 --> 01:29:10.511
We have a hit-and-run
over on South Street.

01:29:14.724 --> 01:29:16.975
Keep the coffee hot, Hugo.

01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:19.061
Okay, sir.
