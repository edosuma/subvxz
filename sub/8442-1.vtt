No, I got it.
I got it, I got it.

00:37.428 --> 00:38.805
I got it. Thank you.

00:38.971 --> 00:41.849
You're very helpful, okay?
Yeah, yeah, and cute.

00:42.016 --> 00:44.393
- Who is it?
- It's Ross.

00:44.560 --> 00:47.437
- Are you by yourself?
- Yeah, I'm by myself.

00:47.605 --> 00:48.647
You sure?

00:50.899 --> 00:52.609
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm by myself.

00:52.776 --> 00:54.736
Yeah, that's it.
Just stay right there.

00:58.115 --> 00:59.992
Get in here. Hurry up.

01:04.830 --> 01:07.625
- How much do you need?
- What you gave me last time was cool.

01:07.792 --> 01:09.502
- How much you want?
- Whatever you got.

01:09.669 --> 01:10.670
You know what?

01:12.087 --> 01:15.758
I lost my shit. I have to find it,
so if you don't mind relaxing a little bit?

01:15.924 --> 01:18.511
- No, I can come back.
- No, no. It's okay.

01:18.678 --> 01:20.138
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:20.303 --> 01:23.473
It's great to see you. Why don't
you sit down and talk to...

01:23.641 --> 01:25.016
To Nikki. Talk to Nikki.

01:25.434 --> 01:28.854
Nikki, this is Ross.
Ross, this is Nikki.

01:30.106 --> 01:31.148
Nice to meet you.

01:31.356 --> 01:33.317
You know Frisbee over there.

01:33.484 --> 01:34.652
What?

01:34.819 --> 01:37.029
- Hey, man.
- What's up?

01:38.030 --> 01:43.036
And you just stay, relax, just sit down
and let me find my shit, okay?

01:48.750 --> 01:50.417
So...

01:50.668 --> 01:53.588
...what you looking at?
- I just need a little bit.

01:53.755 --> 01:56.673
- What do you mean? Half or something?
- I don't need that much.

01:56.841 --> 01:59.302
I don't even have that much money.
I just need a dime.

02:00.386 --> 02:02.305
- Oh, I got it.
- I got it.

02:02.472 --> 02:04.681
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

02:07.559 --> 02:08.894
- Who is it?
- Giggles.

02:09.061 --> 02:11.563
LA Sadgirl.
From Circus Liquors.

02:11.730 --> 02:14.901
- I'm busy right now.
- You're busy? Can we stop by later?

02:15.068 --> 02:18.653
What part of busy don't you understand?
I don't got anything. Goodbye!

02:18.862 --> 02:21.741
<i>- Pinche cabrÃ³n!
- Pinche enano.</i>

02:23.033 --> 02:28.330
If Spider doesn't get his shit together,
I can probably help you out.

02:31.167 --> 02:32.209
I got it!

02:32.418 --> 02:35.420
No, don't answer my phone.
Don't answer my phone!

02:35.587 --> 02:37.173
Hello?

02:37.923 --> 02:39.884
No. He's unavailable at the moment.

02:41.927 --> 02:43.428
You'll have to call back later.

02:43.888 --> 02:46.557
Much, much later. Later.

02:49.769 --> 02:51.395
Who is it?

02:52.604 --> 02:54.064
It's just me, Spider.

02:54.232 --> 02:56.651
Hey. Go away, fat boy!

02:57.443 --> 03:02.240
- I said, go away, fat boy!
- Okay, okay. I'll see you later.

03:06.786 --> 03:10.080
- Mike, who called on the telephone?
- Why don't you sit down...

03:10.288 --> 03:12.249
...and talk to your friend Nikki.

03:14.668 --> 03:16.253
- Hey, Cookie.
- What's up?

03:20.215 --> 03:22.718
Oh, shit. Damn.

03:23.051 --> 03:25.387
- Shit. What am I gonna do, Nikki?
- Spider Mike...

03:25.554 --> 03:28.265
...who called on the telephone, please?

03:28.432 --> 03:31.643
Spider Mike went
to Circus Liquor earlier.

03:31.811 --> 03:33.395
Maybe he dropped the dope...
Spider?

03:33.562 --> 03:37.275
Did you ride your bike to Circus Liquor?
You did?

03:37.442 --> 03:39.235
Okay. That's only a block
and a half away.

03:39.402 --> 03:41.778
Why don't you stop freaking out
and backtrack.

03:41.945 --> 03:43.948
- I bet you dropped the shit.
- Yeah.

03:44.115 --> 03:47.117
- Yeah.
- I bet you dropped it on the way back.

03:47.325 --> 03:50.288
You were on your bike,
and you just dropped it.

03:50.746 --> 03:53.248
You know, you're right!
Yeah!

03:53.832 --> 03:55.500
- Yeah, you dropped it.
- Yeah!

03:55.667 --> 03:58.463
- He dropped it.
- I did. I dropped it.

03:58.629 --> 04:00.088
I love this dude.

04:00.255 --> 04:02.174
Suck my cock!

04:02.675 --> 04:05.010
Fuck, I love this guy.

04:05.344 --> 04:08.680
Michael? Who called
on the goddamn phone?

04:11.809 --> 04:14.770
I don't know, you fucking asshole!

04:18.565 --> 04:19.565
Holy shit!

04:19.733 --> 04:22.445
- What the fuck is the matter with you?
- You!

04:23.821 --> 04:26.782
What the hell is the matter with you,
you little slut?

04:26.948 --> 04:28.618
<i>Genghis Cunt!</i>

04:29.034 --> 04:30.619
Spider, you son of a bitch!

04:30.786 --> 04:33.790
Don't you fucking hit me
with shit again!

04:34.123 --> 04:37.794
Look, everybody just stay sitting down.
Nobody goes out...

04:37.960 --> 04:40.004
...and nobody comes in.
You understand?

04:40.213 --> 04:43.382
I saw a lot of cop cars
out there earlier.

04:43.548 --> 04:45.426
A lot of cop cars.

04:45.593 --> 04:48.388
There were a lot of cops
out there earlier.

04:48.553 --> 04:50.972
If you look...
If you look...

04:51.140 --> 04:52.850
Where?

04:53.141 --> 04:55.352
- I don't see anything, man.
- No, if you just look...

04:55.520 --> 04:57.563
- I don't see anything, man.
- No?

04:58.898 --> 05:01.442
- There's nobody there.
- They were there.

05:01.609 --> 05:03.193
Where are they if they're there?

05:03.402 --> 05:06.238
- I don't know.
- Because there's nobody there, man!

05:06.406 --> 05:09.700
Little fuckhead.
There's no piggy scare, you stupid...

05:10.492 --> 05:11.703
You fuck!

05:11.869 --> 05:15.247
Fucking relax, all right?
Just stay sitting down, goddamn it!

05:16.416 --> 05:18.041
- I'm sorry.
- Fucking phone!

05:23.213 --> 05:25.216
Nobody moves!

05:29.011 --> 05:32.013
So, Ross. Girlfriend frustrated?
Little unsatisfied?

05:32.180 --> 05:34.099
Can't you keep it hard?
Need a little lift?

05:34.934 --> 05:37.686
- I'm not seeing anyone.
- Who was that April chick...

05:37.854 --> 05:41.274
...waiting in your car when you were
here a week ago?

05:43.776 --> 05:47.070
April and I hook up occasionally,
but she's not my girlfriend.

05:47.279 --> 05:49.948
My girlfriend is out of town,
in the city.

05:50.115 --> 05:53.910
She got a cool corporate job offer
this summer, so she's up there.

05:54.454 --> 05:56.748
Wait. Like, April...

05:56.955 --> 06:00.792
Like, naughty girl, kind of nice girl,
blondie stripper April?

06:00.959 --> 06:03.253
- That April?
- Yeah. How do you know her?

06:06.882 --> 06:09.719
Hello?
Nikki, it's for you.

06:11.387 --> 06:15.891
Hey, baby.
Spider spaced our shit off again.

06:16.224 --> 06:20.563
If he doesn't find the shit, he'll have
to cough up another 500 bucks.

06:20.730 --> 06:25.276
Just keep your eye on him. I don't
trust that little fag anymore. Yeah.

06:26.069 --> 06:29.571
- How's my baby doing?
- I'm okay, baby.

06:29.739 --> 06:32.408
I just can't wait to get back
to the room, though.

06:32.909 --> 06:36.329
I can't wait to lay
a yard of dick on you, honey.

06:36.537 --> 06:38.456
I love you, baby.

06:39.873 --> 06:42.085
If it's the same April
I think it is...

06:42.251 --> 06:44.420
...then we work together at Jiggles.

06:44.587 --> 06:45.962
Yeah, same April.

06:56.391 --> 06:57.474
Cool.

06:57.641 --> 06:59.852
Those are nice sunglasses.
Let me try those.

07:00.019 --> 07:01.645
Here.

07:01.853 --> 07:03.481
You try mine.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.816
They look nice on you.

07:11.864 --> 07:15.367
Sometimes I wonder if Spider
really loses the shit...

07:15.534 --> 07:17.452
...or if he's trying to dick us.

07:17.619 --> 07:20.872
- Dick you?
- Dick my boyfriend, really.

07:22.207 --> 07:25.002
You'd never dick me.

07:25.169 --> 07:26.837
Would you, Ross?

07:27.379 --> 07:29.799
No. No. I'm sorry.

07:30.341 --> 07:32.218
- No.
- You're tense.

07:33.010 --> 07:35.513
- I just want to get hooked up.
- I understand.

07:35.722 --> 07:39.808
That really pisses me off. Spider better
find some fucking eyeballs quick.

07:39.975 --> 07:43.020
You know this is the third time
he's spaced our shit off?

07:43.186 --> 07:44.146
Kill, kill!

07:56.575 --> 07:58.536
Did you find it? Did you find the shit?

07:58.702 --> 08:02.206
That's it, man. That's it.
Everybody get out. Come on.

08:02.415 --> 08:05.542
- I'll call you as soon as I figure this out.
- Ross stays.

08:05.751 --> 08:07.252
Please, everybody get out.

08:07.419 --> 08:11.965
Hold on. I just have one more monkey.
I really gotta kill this monkey.

08:12.133 --> 08:15.928
If you say monkey one more time,
I'm gonna shove my hand up your ass...

08:16.095 --> 08:18.138
...and shut your mouth
permanently. Got it?

08:18.305 --> 08:20.182
Now get the fuck out of here.

08:20.349 --> 08:22.267
- He asked me to leave...
- I know.

08:23.561 --> 08:26.104
What are you doing?
He's the last one!

08:26.730 --> 08:29.233
He was the last one!

08:29.524 --> 08:32.443
Fine, man. I'll go to Main Street
and score my shit.

08:32.611 --> 08:34.780
Yeah, get your little chicken feed.

08:34.947 --> 08:37.283
I'll go to Main Street
because they have good shit.

08:37.450 --> 08:40.409
You like that little chicken feed?
Is that what you want?

08:40.952 --> 08:43.080
Little chicken feed, huh?

08:49.712 --> 08:52.131
You're a fucking asshole!

08:54.967 --> 08:56.426
Hey! Hey!
What happened?

08:56.593 --> 08:58.846
Where have you been?
Did you find it?

08:59.013 --> 09:01.474
- I don't know where it is!
- Why not?

09:01.641 --> 09:04.143
If I did, I would have had it on me.

09:04.310 --> 09:06.979
If that was the case,
wouldn't I have walked in with it?

09:07.145 --> 09:11.776
- This is the third time you lost the shit.
- That's so fucking unfair!

09:11.943 --> 09:14.778
You're always blaming me.
You always knock me down.

09:14.945 --> 09:17.447
Maybe if you'd put me up,
I wouldn't be such a fuckup!

09:17.657 --> 09:19.200
Fine!

09:25.414 --> 09:26.457
Fucking...

09:26.666 --> 09:27.834
It's okay.

09:28.083 --> 09:30.168
Fucking shithead! Loser!

09:30.585 --> 09:32.630
Fuck! Don't call me a loser, Cookie!

09:32.797 --> 09:33.756
Loser!

09:38.593 --> 09:42.265
Frisbee, sex and travel, man.
I told you to sex and travel.

09:42.431 --> 09:44.850
- Take a fucking hike, you understand?
- It's me.

09:45.018 --> 09:48.813
Oh, hey, man. Hey, man.
Look, I'm really fucking sorry, man.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.274
I haven't got anything.
Why don't you just split?

09:52.025 --> 09:55.152
Fucking loser. Loser! Loser!

09:56.029 --> 09:58.322
Hey, baby. It's me.

09:59.490 --> 10:01.491
Loser.

10:05.454 --> 10:08.874
You see, your friend out there,
she said that...

10:09.042 --> 10:11.209
That she could hook me up
with her own stash.

10:11.376 --> 10:12.711
What is with you and Nikki?

10:12.878 --> 10:16.548
If she hooks you up with some
of her own personal stash...

10:16.715 --> 10:18.800
...it's not gonna be
her own personal stash.

10:21.887 --> 10:25.849
Yeah. There's this guy here
named Ross, and he's got a car.

10:26.017 --> 10:28.352
- What kind?
- Volvo.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.355
- And what color?
- Brown.

10:30.521 --> 10:34.525
Bring him by, and tell that insect
I said to chill the fuck out.

10:34.691 --> 10:37.195
Spider, he says,
"Chill the fuck out!"

10:37.403 --> 10:40.615
This guy's got the knowledge, man.

10:40.781 --> 10:43.450
He's the man.
Few people have what this guy has.

10:43.617 --> 10:45.244
He's like a gold mine.

10:45.411 --> 10:47.204
<i>I'll talk to you later.
I love you.</i>

10:47.372 --> 10:48.538
Bye.

10:53.419 --> 10:56.588
- Everything cool? Can we do this?
- Yeah. You ready?

10:58.257 --> 11:03.930
You better get back here and fuck me,
bastard, if you want any kind of dinner!

11:05.764 --> 11:08.058
You better get your skinny ass
back here!

11:08.267 --> 11:10.937
I guess it's time to go
make up with Mama, huh?

11:11.311 --> 11:13.021
Sounds like a good plan.

11:13.188 --> 11:16.233
- You know where I live, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:20.279 --> 11:23.741
- This one right here?
- Right. Park right over there.

11:27.869 --> 11:30.456
Okay, wait right here.
I'll be right back.

11:33.375 --> 11:36.253
Wait here, hon.
Don't leave.

11:36.837 --> 11:38.297
Baby. Hi.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.734
Hey.

11:59.068 --> 12:00.277
- What's up?
- How you doing?

12:00.444 --> 12:03.113
- Here's for bringing the girl back.
- Oh, shit. Thanks.

12:04.532 --> 12:07.994
- She get your number?
- Yeah, I gave her my number.

12:08.161 --> 12:12.790
- We'll call you when we need you.
- Thank you so much. You just call.

12:12.999 --> 12:15.959
Bye. I'll see you later.

16:45.604 --> 16:49.358
<i>Ross? It's your mother. I'm coming
in a couple of weeks to visit.</i>

16:49.525 --> 16:52.904
<i>Call so we can make some plans,
okay? Love you. Bye- bye.</i>

17:13.799 --> 17:17.051
<i>Ross? Hi, it's April.
I'd love to see you.</i>

17:17.219 --> 17:19.721
<i>I'm dancing today.
Stop in if you can find the time.</i>

17:43.496 --> 17:46.290
<i>Hey, it's me, Amy.</i>

17:46.499 --> 17:48.793
<i>Happy belated birthday.</i>

17:49.001 --> 17:52.797
<i>I didn't send you anything,
because you owe me $450.</i>

17:52.964 --> 17:55.590
<i>Come on, Ross, you've owed
this to me for over a year.</i>

17:55.924 --> 18:00.178
<i>Anyway, I didn't call to bitch. Just
to say, mail me the money, all right?</i>

18:00.345 --> 18:02.264
<i>You have my address.</i>

18:02.515 --> 18:06.352
<i>Come on, take care of it.
Take care of yourself. Bye.</i>

18:19.699 --> 18:24.037
<i>Hi, it's Amy. I'm not here, so leave
a message and I'll call you back.</i>

18:34.714 --> 18:36.507
Hey, baby.

18:39.385 --> 18:42.137
I just love your smell, honey.

18:53.148 --> 18:56.568
<i>It's April. I'd love to see you.
I'm dancing today...</i>

19:27.767 --> 19:29.686
<i>Ross. Ross.</i>

19:29.852 --> 19:31.437
<i>Ross.</i>

19:58.631 --> 20:00.632
<i>Let's see you guys
give it up some.</i>

20:00.800 --> 20:02.885
<i>There's no finer specimen
than the female...</i>

20:14.856 --> 20:16.441
Hey. April's over at the bar.

20:16.648 --> 20:18.651
- You must be holding.
- My place.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.125
<i>- Yeah?
- Hey, Volvo.</i>

21:17.292 --> 21:19.504
We have a little situation
here with the dog.

21:19.670 --> 21:22.215
- Honey, is he coming?
- Can you...

21:22.382 --> 21:24.884
<i>- ...give Nikki a ride?
- Yeah.</i>

21:25.051 --> 21:26.301
I'll be right over.

21:26.468 --> 21:29.847
It'll take me about...
About 15 minutes.

21:30.932 --> 21:35.019
- He's on his way.
- You better untie me if you're leaving.

21:38.564 --> 21:40.733
Now, I've gotta go out
for a second.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.693
Ross, you have to untie me.

21:42.901 --> 21:46.072
- I don't have to untie you.
- I have to be at work.

21:47.031 --> 21:48.908
I'll be back before you have to go
to work.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.576
What are you doing?

21:53.412 --> 21:56.541
I'm actually gonna come back
with some shit. Okay, baby?

21:59.794 --> 22:02.004
You know how good
you were last night?

22:03.214 --> 22:05.215
You were real good.
Shut up! Please.

22:05.424 --> 22:07.635
Look at me. Look at me.

22:08.802 --> 22:09.803
Okay, look.

22:10.596 --> 22:12.015
Just stay here.

22:13.099 --> 22:15.935
For crying out loud,
where the hell is he?

22:17.436 --> 22:19.772
Just, this is really important, okay? Bye.

22:21.064 --> 22:22.774
Hey, you want a little song maybe?

22:23.900 --> 22:26.446
We have your favorite, okay?

22:32.785 --> 22:34.578
Okay, ready?

22:34.745 --> 22:36.079
I'll be back.

22:54.222 --> 22:56.642
Ross, come in quick!
Get in here quick!

22:57.727 --> 22:59.770
- Would you look at Taco?
- That dog's green.

22:59.936 --> 23:03.148
He's dying, Ross. We have
to get him to the vet right now.

23:03.316 --> 23:04.650
Oh, Jesus.

23:04.817 --> 23:07.320
- What's wrong? What happened?
- Come on!

23:07.487 --> 23:08.446
What happened?

23:08.654 --> 23:12.617
She'll calm down. Just take the dog
to the doggy hospital.

23:14.993 --> 23:17.120
Ross, come on, let's go!

23:17.329 --> 23:19.248
What happened to the dog?

23:19.414 --> 23:22.502
A little too much
secondhand smoke.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.796
Ross? Please!

23:25.004 --> 23:26.589
Maybe we should open a window.

23:29.132 --> 23:30.634
Come on, motherfucker!

23:31.176 --> 23:34.138
Volvo boy, just take the dog
to the damn hospital...

23:34.304 --> 23:36.849
...and shut the door on your way out.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

23:42.146 --> 23:44.273
- No, my baby. No, Taco.
- What was going on?

23:44.440 --> 23:47.818
He's the fucking cook, okay?
He makes the shit.

23:47.984 --> 23:50.154
How do you breathe in there?
I almost passed out.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.989
- Could you hold Taco, please?
- Jesus Christ, Nikki!

23:53.156 --> 23:54.491
You're fine. Just hold him.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.703
- He smells like shit!
- I have to do a rail.

23:57.869 --> 24:00.915
- On the fucking dash?
- I need to do a rail right now.

24:01.082 --> 24:03.334
What the fuck am I gonna
tell the vet, Ross?

24:05.711 --> 24:06.712
Okay.

24:22.728 --> 24:24.187
Hi. Hi.

24:24.396 --> 24:26.566
Somebody has to help him right away.

24:26.774 --> 24:29.652
We'll rush him right back
to Dr. K, but first we'll need...

24:29.819 --> 24:32.572
...the initial examination fee
of $54, ma'am.

24:32.739 --> 24:37.200
I'm sorry, it's policy.
We take cash, credit cards or checks.

24:47.378 --> 24:51.549
<i>Hi, it's Amy. I'm not here, so leave
a message and I'll call you back.</i>

24:51.758 --> 24:55.595
Hey, Amy, it's Ross.
How are you? I'm doing really good.

24:59.265 --> 25:03.019
Oh, are you the doctor? Hi.

25:04.020 --> 25:05.730
Hi, thank God.

25:06.355 --> 25:08.775
- Dr. K, this is...
- Taco.

25:08.983 --> 25:11.194
- Here. Can you just...?
- So. So, so, so, so...

25:11.444 --> 25:12.737
I got a job...

25:13.196 --> 25:16.616
...and I'm... I'm working for a chemist.

25:16.783 --> 25:19.577
And he's working me really hard,
and I haven't slept.

25:20.370 --> 25:25.248
- What seems to be the problem?
- I really don't know.

25:25.665 --> 25:29.628
I need you to call me when you get this.
I really need you to call me, okay?

25:30.254 --> 25:34.092
Can you please fix him?
Because I'm really worried, okay?

25:34.467 --> 25:37.929
- We'll just keep him overnight.
- Thank you.

25:38.137 --> 25:41.306
Okay, I love you.
Okay, bye. It's Ross.

25:41.516 --> 25:47.229
- Okay. Oh, I love you too, baby. Bye.
- We'll keep him overnight.

25:47.396 --> 25:51.651
Sorry. Thank you. Have a good day!

26:15.006 --> 26:16.092
Frisbee, honey?

26:19.178 --> 26:21.597
Sweetie? Could you come
get me something to eat?

26:23.683 --> 26:26.810
Do you hear me? Frisbee, honey?

26:29.688 --> 26:33.651
Frisbee, honey, what are you doing?
Could you get Mommy a soda?

26:36.070 --> 26:39.198
When I get back, there better be
a joint in my drawer.

26:41.366 --> 26:44.328
- I love you, baby.
- I love you too.

26:52.210 --> 26:54.713
It's Ross, honey. Let him in!

26:59.719 --> 27:01.846
- Honey?
- What?

27:02.013 --> 27:04.182
Turn the fucking music down, please!

27:07.267 --> 27:13.524
It's Ross. Turn down the fucking music
and let... Never mind.

27:13.900 --> 27:16.234
- Never mind!
- What?!

27:23.826 --> 27:27.120
You don't even give a flying fuck
about Taco, do you?

27:27.287 --> 27:29.206
Asshole.

27:30.165 --> 27:31.376
How'd it go?

27:31.541 --> 27:33.503
Vet said he wants to keep
the dog overnight.

27:34.169 --> 27:36.714
Didn't look very good.
You should really open a window.

27:39.091 --> 27:41.094
- Yeah?
- Did you touch her?

27:41.760 --> 27:43.054
What do you mean?

27:43.429 --> 27:46.556
- You know goddamn well what I mean.
- No, I don't.

27:46.765 --> 27:49.102
She got a nice-looking body,
doesn't she?

27:49.810 --> 27:52.479
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

27:52.688 --> 27:55.274
You know goddamn well...

27:55.483 --> 27:57.193
- Okay.
...what I'm talking about.

28:02.989 --> 28:05.368
Hey, look at this.
Wow, look at this shit.

28:05.535 --> 28:07.245
Goddamn! Look at this.

28:07.453 --> 28:10.873
Look at it. Damn, look at that.
Look at this part right here.

28:12.082 --> 28:14.626
Look at that. That's cruel shit.
Look at that shit, man.

28:15.086 --> 28:18.255
Actually, maybe the road stops here.
I can't give you that ride.

28:20.967 --> 28:22.510
I need a ride.

28:22.677 --> 28:25.887
Ross has gotta run me down
to the truck stop.

28:26.097 --> 28:28.391
Maybe take a cab. Here.

28:30.309 --> 28:32.061
I'll take a cab.

28:32.270 --> 28:34.731
Goddamn, baby, you look hot.

28:36.107 --> 28:38.568
What do you care?

28:39.152 --> 28:40.445
Baby!

28:42.488 --> 28:46.325
- She's a fine-looking woman, huh?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah, great.

28:46.534 --> 28:49.037
No, I mean... Hey, it's cool.

28:54.208 --> 28:58.462
- What do we need at the truck stop?
- I gotta get some ingredients.

29:16.563 --> 29:19.525
So anyway, I heard that he was
carrying some of these fixings...

29:19.692 --> 29:22.987
...for that metalphetamine stuff,
whatever the hell they call it.

29:23.196 --> 29:24.988
Goddamn druggies!

29:25.155 --> 29:28.159
I mean, I was never into that.
I can't understand how they do that.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.995
But anyway,
so he was traveling down I-5...

29:31.204 --> 29:33.456
...and he was probably speeding.
He usually was.

29:33.623 --> 29:35.832
He's going too fast,
and then, all of a sudden...

29:36.041 --> 29:38.335
...after this big curve,
you just couldn't find him.

29:38.502 --> 29:41.464
I mean, he's just off on the road
and everything...

29:41.672 --> 29:43.840
...and it was so dark,
and so I heard...

29:44.049 --> 29:46.343
...that they followed the sound
of his music.

29:46.551 --> 29:48.513
From the radio.
It was playing so loud...

29:48.680 --> 29:52.350
...and he was just pacing back and forth
and pacing back and forth, and...

29:52.517 --> 29:54.852
And he was just gushing with blood.

29:55.477 --> 29:58.313
- But he said he was okay...
- Lady, got any more of these fuckers?

29:58.481 --> 30:00.857
Oh, yeah. We got...
They sell like crazy.

30:01.067 --> 30:03.652
We always keep an extra case
stashed under here.

30:04.737 --> 30:07.031
Now I gotta order another one.

30:07.198 --> 30:12.912
I'm new. If you could just hold on,
I got to designate me a reorder.

30:13.079 --> 30:14.746
What are you gonna do
with all those?

30:15.163 --> 30:17.958
Lady, how much do I owe you?

30:22.046 --> 30:23.130
$ 135.

30:23.296 --> 30:25.257
What do you need all those for?

30:25.590 --> 30:28.928
Well, I was thinking maybe
I'd take a little trip to Russia.

30:29.095 --> 30:33.265
They don't sell them over there,
and they got a little emergency going.

30:33.432 --> 30:35.684
A lot of tired drivers, you know?

30:37.020 --> 30:41.273
Do their thing, you know?
So I thought I'd be a nice guy and just...

30:41.774 --> 30:43.067
That all right with you?

30:43.276 --> 30:45.778
That's a nice Christian thing to do.

30:45.945 --> 30:48.406
- You have a real good day.
- You have a real good day too.

30:48.573 --> 30:50.032
Bye.

30:50.198 --> 30:51.950
That's a dollar.

30:53.118 --> 30:55.079
Thank you. Have a good day.

31:22.981 --> 31:24.609
Did we get enough ingredients?

31:25.150 --> 31:28.779
It's never enough.
It's enough to get back to work.

31:30.531 --> 31:33.283
What's the longest you've
ever stayed up on this shit?

31:34.911 --> 31:38.497
- About 11, I don't know, 12, 13 days.
- Fuck, man.

31:38.663 --> 31:41.917
- That's it.
- That's a lot of days.

31:43.336 --> 31:45.588
- Do you shave your balls?
- Let's go by the market.

31:45.754 --> 31:47.631
I wanna get some beer.

31:54.513 --> 31:55.306
I told you bitches how many times?

31:55.306 --> 31:56.431
I told you bitches how many times?

31:56.598 --> 31:59.560
I'll cut one of your tits off.
You go to Spider Mike's...

31:59.727 --> 32:01.688
...you'll wish you never fucked with me.

32:01.854 --> 32:03.189
Spider Mike's shit sucks.

32:03.356 --> 32:05.732
White boys don't know how
to cook that shit.

32:06.274 --> 32:09.028
Angel, we looked everywhere
for your nowhere ass.

32:09.194 --> 32:11.488
We had to go to that
Wonder Bread's house.

32:11.698 --> 32:13.156
He wasn't holding nothing.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.492
He wouldn't even open
the fucking door.

32:15.701 --> 32:18.495
- You know where I hang.
- All right, we won't go there.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.665
- Just leave.
- Yeah, get out of here.

32:20.873 --> 32:23.376
I'll cut Spider Mike
if I catch you in his place.

32:23.543 --> 32:27.129
You better go. You better get out,
or I'm gonna call the cops!

32:27.380 --> 32:31.009
- We're gonna call the fucking cops.
- Okay, okay. I'm going. I'm going.

32:32.385 --> 32:34.220
- I forgot something.
- No.

32:34.386 --> 32:35.555
Come here for a second.

32:36.263 --> 32:37.640
- Come here for a second.
- No.

32:37.806 --> 32:39.307
Something I gotta tell you.

32:41.519 --> 32:44.104
You're lucky that's all I do!

32:44.271 --> 32:46.523
<i>Hey, SeÃ±or el Fucking Camino.</i>

32:47.984 --> 32:49.527
Who the fuck are you?

33:02.164 --> 33:03.583
Goddamn.

33:04.167 --> 33:06.335
You all got any Cools?

33:06.502 --> 33:07.837
Give me a pack of Cools.

33:08.004 --> 33:11.882
I'll take the beer. Got any
sunglasses in the lost and found?

33:12.090 --> 33:13.384
- Here.
- What do I owe you?

33:13.592 --> 33:16.094
Take them quick before
his posse comes.

33:19.765 --> 33:21.684
- Sexy cowboy.
- All right. Thanks.

33:21.850 --> 33:24.353
- Take it. Take care.
- You all have a good one.

33:24.519 --> 33:26.938
- Okay. Bye, baby.
- Sexy.

33:27.106 --> 33:29.734
- Bye.
- Bye.

33:50.629 --> 33:52.799
So how many more stops
we have to make?

33:53.090 --> 33:57.094
We gotta go to the porn shop.
Get some fuck videos.

33:59.639 --> 34:02.934
I just really need to make
a phone call at some point.

34:03.101 --> 34:05.603
Just keep driving, lover-boy.

34:45.016 --> 34:50.398
All right, look for videos that got
blond chicks with long hair...

34:50.565 --> 34:53.567
...big titties and small asses.

34:53.734 --> 34:58.697
And the small ass, man, that takes
priority. Unless the tits are perfect.

34:58.864 --> 35:03.327
If the tits are perfect,
then we go with the tits.

35:04.704 --> 35:05.996
- How about this one?
- No, man.

35:06.163 --> 35:09.750
That's the perfect example
of what I don't like. You see that?

35:09.916 --> 35:13.671
That's a loose ass. There's nothing
I hate more than a loose ass.

35:19.509 --> 35:23.389
<i>You know I take the pussy
seriously. Let me tell you.</i>

35:23.556 --> 35:29.770
<i>You gotta take the pussy seriously.
I mean, there's a priority for a tight ass.</i>

35:29.937 --> 35:34.566
But if it's hairy, I go for the tits.

35:35.068 --> 35:39.488
<i>But if the tits are hairy,
hey, it's right back to the pussy.</i>

35:40.822 --> 35:43.533
<i>But you've gotta speak
to that pussy, son.</i>

35:43.742 --> 35:46.370
You know, really talk to it.
You make a vow to it.

35:47.955 --> 35:51.209
Now, no nation has
ever been so ready...

35:51.375 --> 35:56.214
<i>...to seize the power and the
freedom of the pussy as our own...</i>

35:56.422 --> 35:59.925
<i>...and we must all care for that pussy.</i>

36:00.092 --> 36:04.888
<i>Today, we do more
than just celebrate the pussy.</i>

36:05.097 --> 36:08.684
<i>We re-dedicate ourselves
to the very idea of pussy.</i>

36:09.101 --> 36:14.941
<i>I mean, friends, ask not
what the pussy can do for you...</i>

36:15.108 --> 36:17.818
<i>...but what can you do for the pussy.</i>

36:24.200 --> 36:26.327
Ain't that right, Volvo?

36:28.912 --> 36:30.373
Here we go.

36:31.916 --> 36:36.712
This is a long one.
This one's got bonus scenes.

36:38.672 --> 36:43.218
Hundred and twelve girls,
522 penetrations.

36:43.385 --> 36:46.764
Chinese guys with huge cocks,
chicks with dicks.

36:46.931 --> 36:49.891
Now, hey, that's a fucking video.

36:54.147 --> 36:55.898
Hey, buddy boy.

36:56.565 --> 36:58.776
How much for the masterpiece?

36:59.609 --> 37:02.320
$29.99.

37:04.449 --> 37:06.576
- Want a bag?
- Whatever.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.579
Have a good one.

37:18.254 --> 37:20.882
We need a phone.
I need to make a fucking call.

37:21.049 --> 37:24.844
- Come on. Use the phone at the club.
- We're going to the club?

37:40.609 --> 37:44.113
What do you think?
We got the right place?

37:45.490 --> 37:47.950
Man, I don't know. You're driving.
You got the directions.

37:48.159 --> 37:50.828
Stop bitching about that.

37:51.661 --> 37:53.997
- I'm sorry.
- Just quit riding me, old man.

37:54.164 --> 37:56.792
- I'm not fucking old.
- Just don't make me look bad...

37:56.959 --> 37:59.878
<i>...with this camera crew, all right?
- Hey, remember...</i>

38:00.045 --> 38:02.840
<i>...we're on a live feed.</i>

38:03.049 --> 38:06.385
Guys, we're gonna hold off
for a couple of minutes.

38:13.726 --> 38:17.646
<i>Real cops. Real people.
Real trouble.</i>

38:26.738 --> 38:29.325
Looks like we got our guy here.

38:32.661 --> 38:33.705
All right. We got him.

38:36.249 --> 38:37.709
Hang on.

39:12.743 --> 39:14.286
Is that the chef?

39:16.538 --> 39:20.293
She doesn't fit the description.
I think it's the fucker on the bike.

39:20.584 --> 39:22.336
It doesn't matter.

39:22.836 --> 39:24.588
<i>- Yeah, guys.
- Hey.</i>

39:24.755 --> 39:27.925
<i>- We gotta move in.
- We're right behind you.</i>

39:39.227 --> 39:41.938
- We received several tips.
- And numerous phone calls.

39:42.105 --> 39:45.443
We believe that a large amount
of methamphetamine is being...

39:45.651 --> 39:48.403
...manufactured at this residence.
- At this location.

39:48.570 --> 39:50.864
- We gotta move in.
- Come on. Come on.

39:51.908 --> 39:55.912
- Open the goddamn door. Come on.
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

39:56.079 --> 39:58.121
- Get the fuck down!
- Bitch! Bitch!

39:58.330 --> 40:03.627
Hands on top of that motherfucking
mullet now! Drop the cheese puffs!

40:05.088 --> 40:07.297
- He's over here!
- Excuse me, ma'am.

40:07.464 --> 40:11.010
Freeze! Shit! Fuck.

40:11.803 --> 40:16.765
- Fucking shit, man.
- Up in the air! Up in the fucking air!

40:16.933 --> 40:19.977
Don't you look at me!
Don't you fucking look at me!

40:26.859 --> 40:28.652
I gotta make that call.

40:32.782 --> 40:34.117
Beer.

40:45.001 --> 40:48.296
Nikki is her name, sex is her game.

40:48.463 --> 40:51.341
To not put your hand in your pocket
and get some dollars...

40:51.508 --> 40:54.095
...and take a lap dance
would be a great shame.

40:56.014 --> 40:57.890
Let's hear it for Nikki.

41:14.866 --> 41:19.037
<i>Hi, it's Amy. I'm not here, so leave
a message and I'll call you back.</i>

41:34.634 --> 41:37.764
<i>Hey, it's Ross. I'm out.
Leave a message after the tone.</i>

41:37.930 --> 41:41.351
Hey, April, it's Ross.
April, I know you can hear me.

41:43.018 --> 41:44.728
I'm so sorry I forgot about you.

41:44.936 --> 41:48.274
<i>I'm here right now at the club.
I'll be there as soon as I can.</i>

41:48.441 --> 41:51.069
Hang tight, baby.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

41:53.446 --> 41:54.739
Fuck!

42:35.487 --> 42:38.532
- Ross, thank you.
- No problem, Nikki.

42:38.699 --> 42:39.825
- Bye.
- See you.

42:39.991 --> 42:43.120
Okay, Volvo boy,
I've gotta get back to the office.

42:43.329 --> 42:46.123
So Nikki'll call you when we need you.

42:46.331 --> 42:49.918
Have a good night.
Have a good one.

42:50.335 --> 42:51.713
Bye.

42:52.922 --> 42:54.382
Bye, guys.

43:39.093 --> 43:41.845
I'm sorry. I know I fucked up.

43:44.974 --> 43:47.309
Look, baby, please
don't be pissed, okay?

43:50.730 --> 43:53.691
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
Please don't be mad.

43:53.900 --> 43:58.570
I got caught up, and it took much longer
than I thought it would. I apologize.

43:59.363 --> 44:03.701
I'm gonna take this off. Will you
please not yell? Will you please not yell?

44:04.243 --> 44:06.371
- I'm gonna talk to you.
- You motherfucker!

44:06.537 --> 44:09.998
You have no idea
what I've been going through!

44:10.166 --> 44:14.921
You've no idea where I've been. I've
been alone. Will you listen to me?

44:15.088 --> 44:16.673
No crying, no cry...

44:18.590 --> 44:21.928
- I lost $200 because of you.
- Please be quiet. Now.

44:24.597 --> 44:27.058
- Hey, smurf.
- Hi.

44:27.224 --> 44:29.394
- What's going on?
- I'm watching television.

44:29.560 --> 44:33.271
- I'm sorry I kept it on so loud.
- Pretty funny show, yeah.

44:33.439 --> 44:38.569
It's pretty cool. Check it out. It's on
Channel 4. I'll see you later. Bye.

44:46.536 --> 44:48.830
What's the plan, Stan?

44:51.916 --> 44:53.750
What am I thinking?

44:53.960 --> 44:58.381
- Honey, you don't have a plan.
- No, I got a goddamned plan.

44:58.756 --> 45:01.426
First we're gonna get this batch
over to Spider.

45:01.634 --> 45:06.556
Then we're gonna get our money.
Then I'll pick up your little dog...

45:07.306 --> 45:10.768
...and then I'm gonna fuck
your little ass proper.

45:12.645 --> 45:15.105
- His name is Taco.
- Who?

45:15.272 --> 45:17.566
And you bet your ass
we're gonna pick him up.

45:41.590 --> 45:44.010
Yeah, hey. You got any girls?

45:44.177 --> 45:50.224
Listen, they gotta have nice titties,
nice big titties. Small ass.

45:50.390 --> 45:52.143
<i>- It's for the motel, right?
- Yeah.</i>

45:52.352 --> 45:54.062
<i>- We've got one for you.
- All right.</i>

45:54.228 --> 45:55.520
<i>You got it.</i>

46:10.119 --> 46:11.829
Tag!

46:12.372 --> 46:14.539
- You're it, partner.
- Tag?

46:15.041 --> 46:17.543
Like the game you used to play
when you were a little kid.

46:17.877 --> 46:19.003
It's easy.

46:19.212 --> 46:23.049
- It's your turn to tag somebody now.
- Tag?

46:23.216 --> 46:25.009
We need two names from you.

46:25.217 --> 46:27.679
Then we will go easy on you
and your mother.

46:28.388 --> 46:30.515
- My mother?
- If you agree to help us...

46:30.682 --> 46:34.352
...she'll be in front of her television
by cocktail hour, okay?

46:34.559 --> 46:36.979
- Cocktail hour?
- Fucking echo going on in here.

46:37.146 --> 46:39.147
- Do you hear it?
- You gotta help us now!

46:39.315 --> 46:40.650
Okay, partner?

46:40.817 --> 46:42.984
You gotta play the game!

46:43.151 --> 46:45.363
- Understand?
- Look, look, look, look.

46:45.530 --> 46:49.200
It's not even my shit.
It's not my shit. It's my mom's shit.

46:49.367 --> 46:51.743
- I'm holding it for my mom.
- Come on, Frisbee.

46:52.536 --> 46:55.539
You ain't working
with us here, dude.

46:56.249 --> 47:01.004
Look, we've confiscated your bike,
okay? We've got your porn, your...

47:01.254 --> 47:03.005
- Fucking CDs.
- Your music.

47:03.213 --> 47:05.882
- You ain't got a job.
- You'll never get your stuff back...

47:06.091 --> 47:10.429
Unless you cooperate and...

47:10.930 --> 47:15.017
- Play the game.
- The game?

47:15.183 --> 47:16.227
The fucker drives a fucking Lexus.
He's not gonna ride my ass for free.

47:16.227 --> 47:21.566
The fucker drives a fucking Lexus.
He's not gonna ride my ass for free.

47:21.774 --> 47:25.611
Get your shit together, or I'm going
to Dial-A-Bun! No, you listen to me!

47:25.778 --> 47:30.408
Why don't you fucking listen to me?
I want my cash up-fucking-front!

47:30.742 --> 47:33.702
Honey? Did you order over
some bimbo bitch?

47:33.869 --> 47:36.913
- She's at the door.
- Just open the goddamned door.

47:37.790 --> 47:40.417
- Damn.
- You were right.

47:40.626 --> 47:44.046
I was totally stressed out about Taco.

47:44.212 --> 47:47.550
I'm thinking maybe we could
try out the new batch...

47:48.259 --> 47:53.722
...and get a little nasty.
- That's my girl. Come over here.

47:53.889 --> 47:55.725
Do you know I have a really bad...?

47:56.934 --> 47:58.978
Look at that onion, baby.

48:00.355 --> 48:02.774
- Get the goddamned door.
- I am.

48:02.940 --> 48:06.944
No cash or no fucking ass, all right?
Now get your shit together.

48:07.153 --> 48:10.155
Hold on. You know, I have a really
bad yeast infection.

48:10.322 --> 48:12.074
I'm still fucking working, okay?

48:12.240 --> 48:13.826
Hold on.

48:13.992 --> 48:15.953
Are you gonna let me in?

48:16.371 --> 48:18.456
Honey, what the fuck
are you looking at?

48:19.664 --> 48:22.293
Your fucking whore-bitch face, bitch!

48:25.338 --> 48:27.632
Fuck! You know what?
I'm not doing it.

48:27.924 --> 48:32.136
I just got a fucking door
slammed in my face, all right?

48:34.888 --> 48:36.306
Goddamn.

48:38.309 --> 48:42.145
- What's the problem?
- You don't give a fuck about Taco.

48:42.354 --> 48:44.481
And you sure don't
give a fuck about me.

48:44.941 --> 48:48.652
All you care about is
your stupid, precious batch of fuck.

48:49.194 --> 48:54.199
And maybe, just maybe, getting your
fucking rocks off every now and then.

48:54.366 --> 49:00.164
Goddamn it, don't start in with
your psycho bullshit here, all right?

49:00.330 --> 49:04.126
You wanna go back to Las Vegas with
them Gucci-wearing motherfuckers?

49:04.334 --> 49:07.797
- You want me to go to Vegas?
- I don't give a fuck. Go to Florida...

49:07.963 --> 49:10.173
...with them rich sugar daddies
of yours.

49:10.382 --> 49:14.428
Just get your little white ass
and get the fuck out of my face!

49:15.054 --> 49:17.932
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Fuck you. Go back to your mother.

49:18.099 --> 49:19.141
<i>That fucking cunt.</i>

49:19.349 --> 49:23.229
I'd rather be anywhere in the whole
fucking world other than this room...

49:23.395 --> 49:27.149
...waiting for you to blow up the
whole goddamned place! Fuck you!

49:27.316 --> 49:28.651
Fuck you!

49:28.818 --> 49:32.154
Fuck you, motherfucker!
I can't stand this shit anymore!

49:32.320 --> 49:33.655
I can't believe you...

49:33.822 --> 49:38.035
...called a bitch up here, ordered her
up like a goddamned piece of pizza!

49:38.243 --> 49:39.871
Goddamn it, it was for you!

49:40.079 --> 49:41.830
Fucking did it for me?

49:41.998 --> 49:45.001
- What'd she look like anyway?
- Fuck you!

49:54.135 --> 49:56.888
- Hello?
- Hey, Volvo boy, I need another ride.

49:57.095 --> 49:59.222
I don't know. What do you need?

49:59.389 --> 50:02.894
The shit hit the fan over here
pretty good. Can you get over here now?

50:03.102 --> 50:05.520
- How soon?
- I need you now!

50:15.781 --> 50:17.491
Are you leaving?

50:18.700 --> 50:21.788
- I gotta go.
- Ross, untie me, please.

50:21.953 --> 50:23.622
- No, no, no.
- No.

50:24.123 --> 50:27.042
I'll be right back. I wouldn't hurt you.

50:27.210 --> 50:31.214
April, now just calm down, okay?
You know I wouldn't hurt you.

50:32.465 --> 50:34.466
They need me again.

50:38.429 --> 50:41.265
I'll be right back. Do you hear me?

50:41.556 --> 50:42.975
Stop it!

50:43.726 --> 50:48.731
I'll be right back. I don't wanna do
this. I have to do this, okay? Fuck!

52:00.719 --> 52:04.057
- Did Ross say how long he'll be?
- Hopefully soon.

52:04.849 --> 52:07.518
I can't wait for him
to get his ass out here.

52:10.855 --> 52:13.106
So I guess...

52:13.524 --> 52:15.651
...it's over. We're finished.

52:15.818 --> 52:17.236
We're through, right?

52:17.486 --> 52:20.281
Well, you might be through.
I ain't never through.

52:28.247 --> 52:29.331
Bye.

52:29.540 --> 52:32.627
- Bye? Where are you going?
- I'll be in the car.

52:35.003 --> 52:36.255
Where's she going?

52:38.758 --> 52:41.636
- She's going wherever you take her.
- Wherever I take her?

52:41.803 --> 52:44.806
Run this over to Spider.

52:45.390 --> 52:47.684
Take her, please, wherever the fuck
she wants to go.

52:48.934 --> 52:52.480
- What the fuck's going on around here?
- Nikki can't handle her shit.

52:52.647 --> 52:55.566
She's been partying
with the candy for 10, 11 days.

52:57.235 --> 52:59.779
And then the bitch crashes
and starts freaking out.

53:01.280 --> 53:04.909
She'll split for a day or two, then
she'll come back. She's just spun.

53:08.203 --> 53:09.371
This is for you.

53:11.081 --> 53:13.459
This is the Hawaii.

53:18.547 --> 53:21.092
So I gotta pop by Spider's
and drop this shit off.

53:21.300 --> 53:24.887
You can either come with or I could
take you somewhere, whatever is best.

53:25.054 --> 53:26.930
It's that fucking bastard.

53:27.097 --> 53:29.558
How can somebody
be such a selfish, insensitive...

53:29.766 --> 53:31.893
...fucking motherfucking bastard?

53:32.060 --> 53:33.813
He never cared about anything!

53:33.979 --> 53:36.648
The only time he was nice to me
was when I first met him.

53:36.815 --> 53:38.942
When, of course,
I've never done speed before.

53:39.151 --> 53:41.279
And he was nice
to Taco to boot, okay?

53:41.446 --> 53:43.614
Fucking fuck-face fucker.

54:00.923 --> 54:01.924
It's Nikki and Ross.

54:03.843 --> 54:05.678
Hey, come on in. Come on.

54:10.974 --> 54:12.309
- Got something for me?
- Yeah.

54:15.729 --> 54:17.814
Why did Taco have to go to the vet?

54:18.023 --> 54:18.982
So how is he doing?

54:19.191 --> 54:21.610
- I mean, he didn't die?
- Fuck, no!

54:21.903 --> 54:25.822
- Come on, come on. Come on, man!
- Okay, Spider, this is it.

54:28.158 --> 54:30.703
- He'll be all right, right?
- Right. He'll be fine.

54:30.870 --> 54:32.955
He's gonna be great.
He is.

54:37.377 --> 54:40.213
- Here you go, all you.
- All me?

54:44.092 --> 54:46.468
I'm hoping Ross brings me
to the vet in the morning.

54:46.635 --> 54:49.013
Then everything's gonna be
just perfect.

54:53.475 --> 54:55.478
- That's good.
- Good shit, huh?

54:55.645 --> 54:56.646
Goddamn!

55:08.365 --> 55:12.327
Looks like the peanut-butter dank
we used to get back in the day, man.

55:16.833 --> 55:20.002
What's the real deal between you
and Nikki? What's she doing with you?

55:21.379 --> 55:23.046
So why are you with Ross?

55:23.797 --> 55:25.633
- It's too hot.
- Because I have a car.

55:25.800 --> 55:28.802
- I've been helping her out with my car.
- He brings me places.

55:28.969 --> 55:31.972
- Special stuff I left behind.
- Helping her out, taking her around.

55:32.140 --> 55:34.850
- He wants to drive me around.
- Yesterday, the dog got sick.

55:35.018 --> 55:36.018
It was fucked up.

55:36.184 --> 55:39.397
The dog got sick, but we got that
cleared up. I've been going ride...

55:39.604 --> 55:43.108
Going on rides with him
and helping him out. I just...

55:44.277 --> 55:46.738
Oh, shit, Cookie!

55:47.112 --> 55:48.906
Don't. No, no, no.

55:49.073 --> 55:51.450
Don't do that.
Don't smoke it like that.

55:51.616 --> 55:53.077
It gives you Alzheimer's, doesn't it?

55:54.412 --> 55:57.457
Give her a ride in my car,
and I'm gonna run errands.

55:57.623 --> 55:58.707
Just came here to...

56:01.878 --> 56:04.004
Right now I'm on my way
to the bus stop...

56:04.172 --> 56:06.632
Yeah, yeah, I understand, man.

56:06.799 --> 56:07.967
I understand. Yeah.

56:17.809 --> 56:18.978
Amy.

56:19.478 --> 56:23.191
- I just thought maybe we could...
- Really? Oh, come on.

56:23.608 --> 56:25.942
You know I hate fucking hippies, man.

56:26.151 --> 56:28.780
You know why I hate hippies?
Because I was downtown...

56:28.946 --> 56:33.743
...and this kid just comes running out
and gets hit by a bus, right?

56:33.910 --> 56:36.954
And the bus just crushes him
and crushes him...

56:37.163 --> 56:40.082
...and runs over him, and the kid's
just squiggling on the ground.

56:43.168 --> 56:44.170
Amy.

56:45.212 --> 56:48.632
And blood is coming out of his ears,
and he's just laying there...

56:48.800 --> 56:51.551
...and then this hippie dyke chick
comes out with crystal...

56:51.718 --> 56:53.220
...and she rubs it all over him.

56:53.388 --> 56:55.138
I wish that I had more energy.

56:55.598 --> 56:56.599
Amy.

56:56.766 --> 57:00.686
And the kid is just laying there,
and he's choking on his own blood.

57:00.852 --> 57:02.979
It's like, "Come on,
you dumb, stupid chick.

57:03.146 --> 57:05.816
What are you doing with your crystals?
He needs a doctor."

57:05.982 --> 57:09.195
- I wish I could sleep forever, man.
- I wish. I wish.

57:09.696 --> 57:13.865
You know, I've seen some crystals
do some pretty trippy shit, man.

57:14.032 --> 57:15.993
Really?

57:16.535 --> 57:19.038
I was out with one of my girlfriends
once in Vegas...

57:19.204 --> 57:20.581
Amy.

57:22.082 --> 57:25.003
And we were hanging out,
and we picked this guy up.

57:25.169 --> 57:27.088
I think he was a Mexican.

57:27.255 --> 57:29.048
I wish I was black.

57:29.215 --> 57:30.841
And we both fucked him.

57:31.008 --> 57:32.051
Amy.

57:32.218 --> 57:33.677
Anyways...

57:33.885 --> 57:36.138
...she got crabs really bad.

57:37.598 --> 57:41.727
And I was wearing this crystal around my
neck all night long, and I never got them.

57:41.893 --> 57:43.646
- Magic crystals.
- Amy.

57:44.146 --> 57:47.150
No, Nikki, Nikki.
What happened was...

57:47.483 --> 57:51.987
...that your friend fucked him first,
and the crabs jumped onto her bush...

57:52.195 --> 57:56.033
...before they got a chance to get
onto yours. That's what happened.

57:56.199 --> 57:58.369
You got lucky you got sloppy seconds.

57:59.411 --> 58:03.875
There's no such thing as
magic-crystal-hippie-crap bullshit.

58:07.670 --> 58:08.671
Ross?

58:08.838 --> 58:10.006
Ross?

58:10.173 --> 58:12.467
Did you ever get crabs, Ross?

58:12.633 --> 58:14.218
Amy.

58:16.803 --> 58:18.680
Amy.

58:49.378 --> 58:51.296
- I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you.

58:51.463 --> 58:52.798
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

58:52.964 --> 58:55.051
- Just... One... Wait.
- Okay.

58:55.635 --> 58:57.803
- Ross, I'm ready.
- I gotta make a phone call.

58:57.969 --> 59:01.056
Spider, do you think I can make
a phone call, use your phone?

59:01.474 --> 59:04.769
There's no phone. No phones, man.
We don't have a phone. Doesn't work.

59:04.977 --> 59:06.270
- Okay.
- Come here, you.

59:06.854 --> 59:08.271
Oh, God.

59:08.438 --> 59:10.274
Boy, I'm really hammered.

59:10.441 --> 59:12.275
- I'll see you soon.
- See you real soon.

59:12.442 --> 59:14.778
- Take good care of her, okay?
- I will. Definitely.

59:22.870 --> 59:25.831
I don't know, guys. This...
It looks really obvious.

59:25.998 --> 59:28.793
This thing pokes out right here
and everything. I don't...

59:29.002 --> 59:30.794
They're gonna notice something.

59:30.961 --> 59:33.797
Hey, Frisbee, don't worry.

59:34.132 --> 59:35.675
Cookie, I'll call you.

59:39.011 --> 59:41.263
Weetis. I love it.

59:41.889 --> 59:43.266
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you too, man.

59:43.433 --> 59:45.267
- Great.
- I hope he's okay.

59:45.600 --> 59:48.478
All you gotta do
is keep your clothes on.

59:48.687 --> 59:51.023
I mean, we're working
together on this. All right?

59:51.315 --> 59:53.151
It's fine, pal.

59:54.401 --> 59:56.571
Hey, hey. Hold on. Hold on.

59:57.487 --> 01:00:01.909
We got two suspects
leaving the premises.

01:00:02.242 --> 01:00:04.119
Hey, Frisbee...

01:00:04.287 --> 01:00:06.331
...is that Spider Mike
and what is it, Cookie?

01:00:06.497 --> 01:00:08.123
That?

01:00:08.874 --> 01:00:13.670
No, no. I don't know them.
I mean, I don't know who they are.

01:00:13.879 --> 01:00:18.760
- You wouldn't tell us a story, would you?
- No, no, no, no.

01:00:18.926 --> 01:00:21.054
It's okay. I'm not lying.
No, I don't...

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:26.058
- If you lie, you lose.
- Yeah. If you lie, pal, it's game over.

01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:29.686
I don't know those people.
I don't know who they are.

01:00:29.853 --> 01:00:32.356
Get the license plate.
They just took off.

01:00:32.773 --> 01:00:36.319
No, you don't need to get the license
plate. It's all right. It's okay.

01:00:36.526 --> 01:00:40.448
Frisbee, all you fucking gotta do
is keep your clothes on...

01:00:40.615 --> 01:00:42.575
...and everything is gonna be just fine.

01:00:43.033 --> 01:00:46.996
You just go in there like
nothing's changed, you hang out...

01:00:47.163 --> 01:00:50.707
...you make a buy, you just walk out.
It's easy as that, chief.

01:00:50.917 --> 01:00:53.335
No. You don't know Spider. He's...

01:00:53.502 --> 01:00:56.673
- Fuck! This isn't gonna work!
- Give me your hand.

01:00:57.005 --> 01:00:58.174
Give me your hand.

01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:03.554
Chill. Just chill. Yeah.

01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:05.223
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

01:01:05.389 --> 01:01:06.682
That's power.

01:01:07.265 --> 01:01:10.436
- We got your back.
- You're doing the right thing.

01:01:10.603 --> 01:01:11.687
We're proud of you.

01:01:15.233 --> 01:01:17.567
You're not gonna try
to take a dump now, are you?

01:01:17.734 --> 01:01:19.111
I feel like I can finally go.

01:01:19.277 --> 01:01:22.073
It's been so long
since I've taken a dump.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.742
Jesus Christ, come on!

01:01:25.702 --> 01:01:28.787
Come on, I haven't been this hard
in a long time. Come on!

01:01:31.916 --> 01:01:32.875
Fucker.

01:01:54.938 --> 01:01:56.106
<i>Hello?</i>

01:01:56.273 --> 01:01:58.109
<i>- Hello?
- Yeah, hello.</i>

01:01:58.276 --> 01:01:59.569
Yeah.

01:02:01.696 --> 01:02:04.114
Can you just help me come
really fast?

01:02:08.411 --> 01:02:10.913
What? You want me
to put something on?

01:02:11.998 --> 01:02:13.166
All right.

01:02:13.333 --> 01:02:15.460
Let me see what I got here.

01:02:18.754 --> 01:02:20.590
Yeah, I think I got something.

01:02:20.757 --> 01:02:22.133
I got something perfect.

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:26.679
I got something that's gonna be clean
and practical. You're gonna like this.

01:02:33.978 --> 01:02:37.064
Jesus Christ, come on!
Put your mouth on it.

01:02:37.231 --> 01:02:39.859
<i>I'm gonna put my man-glaze
all over your fuckin tits.</i>

01:02:43.403 --> 01:02:46.741
<i>- What is he doing? Jesus!
- You guys can hear me, right?</i>

01:02:46.908 --> 01:02:49.117
<i>Can I hear you back?
I can't hear anything.</i>

01:02:49.284 --> 01:02:52.162
Don't look at the car all the time.
Just go in.

01:02:52.329 --> 01:02:55.582
- Oh, Christ!
- Jesus! What the fuck is he doing, man?

01:02:56.042 --> 01:02:57.168
<i>I'm okay.</i>

01:02:57.668 --> 01:03:00.003
Oh, yeah. Come on, lick my ass.
Come on.

01:03:00.587 --> 01:03:03.632
Oh, fuck.

01:03:05.092 --> 01:03:06.886
God!

01:03:22.067 --> 01:03:24.696
Baby, come on.
Come on, don't be mad.

01:03:24.862 --> 01:03:27.656
<i>- You've got me so wet.
- Yeah, come on, baby.</i>

01:03:27.823 --> 01:03:30.952
Come on, baby.
Come on, open up the door!

01:03:31.119 --> 01:03:33.246
I'll let you lick me where I pee.

01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:37.083
Oh, yeah, do it.

01:03:37.541 --> 01:03:39.377
<i>I'm gonna fuck the shit
out of you, yeah.</i>

01:03:40.002 --> 01:03:41.671
- Oh, fuck!
- Who are you talking to?

01:03:41.838 --> 01:03:44.381
<i>Oh, goddamn!
Oh, you're so fucking tight.</i>

01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:46.217
- Are you on the phone?
- Oh, shit!

01:03:46.384 --> 01:03:48.553
What the fuck is he doing?

01:03:50.137 --> 01:03:53.057
Oh, yeah. Come on, take it, baby!

01:03:54.392 --> 01:03:56.435
What the hell is he doing?
Quit looking at us.

01:04:01.398 --> 01:04:02.775
Open the fucking door!

01:04:02.941 --> 01:04:04.736
<i>You can hear me? Yeah?</i>

01:04:04.902 --> 01:04:06.903
- Is he stupid?
- Yeah.

01:04:07.070 --> 01:04:08.114
I'm going to knock.

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:10.741
I can't do this.

01:04:11.409 --> 01:04:13.744
Get inside the house!

01:04:14.078 --> 01:04:15.413
Okay. Okay.

01:04:23.254 --> 01:04:24.756
Is Spider here?

01:04:24.922 --> 01:04:26.006
Come in.

01:04:27.299 --> 01:04:29.593
- Come on.
- I'm in.

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.637
<i>Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me.</i>

01:04:31.804 --> 01:04:32.930
How you doing, Frisbee?

01:04:33.388 --> 01:04:34.389
Come on.

01:04:34.598 --> 01:04:35.767
Sit right down. Sit down.

01:04:38.602 --> 01:04:40.563
- Oh, you look so good!
- I do?

01:04:40.938 --> 01:04:44.107
<i>- Shit! Fuck! I'm coming!
- Come for me, baby.</i>

01:04:44.274 --> 01:04:46.152
Yeah, baby. Fuck, I'm gonna come.

01:04:46.319 --> 01:04:49.404
- Come on, fuck me! Come on.
- What the hell are you doing?

01:04:49.572 --> 01:04:52.282
<i>- Come on, do it to me. Do it to me.
- Come on, say my name!</i>

01:04:52.449 --> 01:04:54.785
Come on, say my name. Yeah!

01:04:54.951 --> 01:04:57.412
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, no, no. I...

01:04:57.871 --> 01:04:59.791
<i>- I was... I should see Spider.
- Frisbee?</i>

01:04:59.956 --> 01:05:00.916
Hello?

01:05:01.125 --> 01:05:03.585
He's fucking this up. Come on!

01:05:03.795 --> 01:05:05.629
You step away from her.

01:05:07.005 --> 01:05:09.091
Don't I turn you on, huh?

01:05:09.299 --> 01:05:12.470
- Come on, take me. Yeah!
- Cookie! What the fuck?

01:05:12.637 --> 01:05:15.264
No. I'm going to...
I should talk to Spider.

01:05:15.431 --> 01:05:16.599
What the fuck is that?

01:05:16.766 --> 01:05:18.225
<i>- It's nothing.
- God, he's fucked!</i>

01:05:19.644 --> 01:05:21.979
- God!
- What's wrong with your piece? Relax.

01:05:22.146 --> 01:05:25.024
What the fuck is that?
What the fuck? Michael!

01:05:25.482 --> 01:05:27.443
- What the fuck?
- Hello?

01:05:30.947 --> 01:05:32.698
- It's my new Walkman.
- What is that?

01:05:32.865 --> 01:05:34.449
- It's just my new Walkman.
- Fuck!

01:05:34.616 --> 01:05:36.661
- You cheating little shit!
- Hello?

01:05:36.828 --> 01:05:38.329
Where are the cops, Frisbee?

01:05:38.496 --> 01:05:41.498
Trying to steal my girlfriend?
Is that what you're trying to do?

01:05:41.665 --> 01:05:43.543
Michael! What the fuck
are you wearing?

01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:45.127
- Shut up!
- Help!

01:05:45.293 --> 01:05:47.587
- Get the fuck in here!
- You got a wire on you, man?

01:05:47.754 --> 01:05:49.007
You bringing the cops here?

01:05:49.173 --> 01:05:50.841
This is where we go in!

01:05:51.175 --> 01:05:52.551
- All right, I just...
- Hold on.

01:05:54.302 --> 01:05:55.304
The fuck...

01:05:57.681 --> 01:05:59.808
- What the fuck was that?
- What the fuck is that?

01:06:03.061 --> 01:06:05.147
Oh, my God, it's the cops!
They're coming!

01:06:26.836 --> 01:06:30.339
- How can you do this to us, man?
- Put the fucking gun down, man.

01:06:30.505 --> 01:06:33.383
Move your hand from your fucking balls.
I'm gonna shoot one ball!

01:06:33.550 --> 01:06:35.928
I'm gonna take one of your balls.
Let me get one. Come on!

01:06:36.095 --> 01:06:37.430
No! Put the gun down, man!

01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:41.558
Let me get one of your balls!
Come on!

01:06:42.726 --> 01:06:43.936
Holy shit!

01:06:46.521 --> 01:06:48.191
Shit! That's gotta hurt, man!

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:51.194
Freeze! Don't fucking move!

01:06:51.361 --> 01:06:53.279
I didn't shoot him.
I didn't shoot him.

01:06:54.571 --> 01:06:55.530
God!

01:06:56.448 --> 01:06:58.784
Shut your mouth,
and keep your hands in the air.

01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:03.623
- What the fuck are you wearing, man?
- You fucking shot me!

01:07:03.956 --> 01:07:05.999
- Now, that's gotta hurt.
- Fuck!

01:07:06.166 --> 01:07:08.211
I hope you die, you fuck!

01:07:08.753 --> 01:07:09.879
You shut the fuck up!

01:07:10.838 --> 01:07:11.839
I'm sorry.

01:08:00.554 --> 01:08:02.597
Hey, honey, you're back for me,
aren't you?

01:08:10.732 --> 01:08:12.817
Fuck you, pussy boy.

01:08:20.491 --> 01:08:22.492
Fucking asshole!

01:08:36.173 --> 01:08:39.510
Come on, man, let me put
my clothes on. Come on, you fuck.

01:08:39.886 --> 01:08:43.514
Fuck your cornholio good,
you fucking scummy asshole!

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:46.515
I'm gonna fucking die!

01:08:46.725 --> 01:08:48.895
Okay, yeah, right, no.
I just got word.

01:08:49.062 --> 01:08:52.022
There's a hotel room of the Las Palmas,
it's up in flames.

01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:54.233
They got the perp at a porno shop.

01:08:54.734 --> 01:08:57.319
I can't feel my legs!

01:08:57.653 --> 01:09:01.032
Who the fuck is that freak
down at the Las Palmas Motel?

01:09:01.198 --> 01:09:03.533
I'm cold, man.

01:09:04.076 --> 01:09:08.872
I'm talking to you. Who the fuck
is that freak down at the motel?

01:09:09.832 --> 01:09:14.502
- I don't fucking know.
- Take your fucking hands off me!

01:09:14.671 --> 01:09:16.462
All right, cover me.

01:09:22.301 --> 01:09:24.638
Hey, I love you, man.

01:09:25.055 --> 01:09:27.558
Fucking pigs!

01:09:31.310 --> 01:09:33.604
I'm so burned...

01:09:33.772 --> 01:09:35.857
...I can't close my eyes.

01:09:36.024 --> 01:09:37.527
I take little naps...

01:09:38.069 --> 01:09:41.947
...like 10 to 15 minutes.
Just, like, a little shutdown time.

01:09:42.115 --> 01:09:44.367
I mean, I still don't ever sleep, but...

01:09:44.533 --> 01:09:47.245
- That works for you?
- Helps a little bit. Yeah.

01:09:47.412 --> 01:09:52.499
- So where are you going anyway?
- I'm going down. Down to Vegas.

01:09:52.792 --> 01:09:57.087
- I got, like, friends and family there.
- That's good.

01:10:09.099 --> 01:10:10.559
He's in the back.

01:10:28.493 --> 01:10:30.288
Oh, goddamn.

01:10:30.454 --> 01:10:32.665
Getting fucked in a porn shop.

01:10:42.675 --> 01:10:46.346
<i>I'm going to see my son.
My son, my son, my son.</i>

01:10:46.512 --> 01:10:48.973
I'm going to see my son.

01:10:49.348 --> 01:10:50.350
Jacob.

01:10:52.602 --> 01:10:54.771
I'm going to see my son, Jacob.

01:10:54.937 --> 01:10:56.938
Your what? You have a son?

01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:00.525
- Here. You want a little bit right now?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:11:00.693 --> 01:11:01.944
Here, here.

01:11:04.655 --> 01:11:06.324
Yeah! Wide awake!

01:11:07.449 --> 01:11:09.284
Where's the kid?
Is he with your mom?

01:11:09.452 --> 01:11:11.244
He's 3 years old.

01:11:11.411 --> 01:11:14.831
<i>He doesn't live with my mom,
because my mom's a fucking cunt.</i>

01:11:15.832 --> 01:11:18.544
- You'll be okay, Nikki. You'll be cool.
- You think so?

01:11:18.710 --> 01:11:19.628
Yeah, man.

01:11:27.469 --> 01:11:30.847
I'm gonna be okay.
I'm gonna be okay.

01:11:31.015 --> 01:11:32.141
You're gonna be okay.

01:11:33.267 --> 01:11:34.851
The state took him away.

01:11:35.019 --> 01:11:38.522
It's weird because stuff happens, and
you don't notice it while it's happening.

01:11:38.689 --> 01:11:40.483
Life is sort of passing by.

01:11:50.534 --> 01:11:51.868
I held him once.

01:11:52.035 --> 01:11:53.412
I held him once.

01:11:53.705 --> 01:11:56.581
Yeah, he felt so nice in my arms.

01:11:58.251 --> 01:11:59.544
And then they took him away.

01:12:00.294 --> 01:12:02.379
I'm gonna hold him again.
I'm gonna hold him real tight.

01:12:02.546 --> 01:12:03.923
I'm gonna hold him
so tight that no one...

01:12:04.089 --> 01:12:05.966
...could take him away
from me ever again.

01:12:08.553 --> 01:12:10.596
Hey, Volvo, bring on your balls.

01:12:13.266 --> 01:12:15.977
<i>You said you'd take care of this.
I really need the money.</i>

01:12:16.144 --> 01:12:18.020
<i>Take care of it.
Take care of it.</i>

01:12:18.186 --> 01:12:20.523
You know what's cool?
My girlfriend, Amy, and I...

01:12:20.689 --> 01:12:23.692
...we're so attracted to each other,
so in love with each other...

01:12:23.859 --> 01:12:25.319
...and she really misses me.

01:12:25.486 --> 01:12:27.529
I can tell from the voice
on her answering machine.

01:12:27.738 --> 01:12:29.907
She really misses me,
and I love her so much.

01:12:30.157 --> 01:12:32.785
It's really great.
We're so attracted to each other.

01:12:34.369 --> 01:12:35.370
Amy, I love you!

01:12:36.914 --> 01:12:39.083
I'm gonna be a really great mother.
You think...?

01:12:39.541 --> 01:12:41.878
You sick motherfucker!
Sick! Sick! Sick!

01:12:43.046 --> 01:12:45.757
You know my girlfriend?
I miss my girlfriend, Amy, so much.

01:12:45.923 --> 01:12:47.132
So...

01:12:51.596 --> 01:12:53.430
- Amy's the best.
- I'm gonna be a great mom.

01:12:53.598 --> 01:12:55.099
I'm gonna be the greatest mom...

01:12:55.641 --> 01:12:58.728
Amy and I are so good together.

01:13:02.773 --> 01:13:04.107
Wide awake.

01:13:04.358 --> 01:13:06.277
- Do you want a little bit?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:13:06.443 --> 01:13:07.527
I need another line.

01:13:07.695 --> 01:13:09.614
- You know what the best part is?
- What?

01:13:11.782 --> 01:13:14.242
- I'm not hooked.
- I know.

01:13:14.744 --> 01:13:16.954
I can stop at any time.

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.916
<i>Everything's gonna be wonderful.</i>

01:13:20.208 --> 01:13:22.335
I am so excited.

01:13:42.437 --> 01:13:45.983
Hey, you got busted like a bitch, boy.

01:13:46.150 --> 01:13:48.360
I'm not Spider Mike right now, okay?

01:13:49.404 --> 01:13:52.197
I shot him in the balls, though, huh?
How about that?

01:13:52.364 --> 01:13:55.743
I shot him right in the balls,
that Judas fucking bastard, man.

01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:58.746
You bring people into your circle,
bring them into your house...

01:13:58.913 --> 01:14:00.832
...and they walk all over you, right?

01:14:01.249 --> 01:14:04.836
- Not like you. You're my friend, right?
- Yeah, yeah. Sure, whatever.

01:14:05.002 --> 01:14:08.005
Well, someone must like you,
you lucky son of a bitch.

01:14:09.172 --> 01:14:10.507
Let's go.

01:14:11.217 --> 01:14:14.012
- Cop, you're gonna let me out too, right?
- Oh, sure.

01:14:14.262 --> 01:14:16.179
What do you mean, "Yeah, sure"?

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:20.518
- Cook, come on, get me out, man.
- See you later, cockroach.

01:14:20.685 --> 01:14:22.645
Come on, Cook. Come on, man.

01:14:22.812 --> 01:14:25.981
We're friends. Don't leave me here.
Cook, come on.

01:14:26.399 --> 01:14:29.735
Yeah, well, thanks. Thanks a lot,
you fucking old bastard.

01:14:29.902 --> 01:14:31.404
Piece of shit.

01:14:31.571 --> 01:14:34.073
What about me, man?
Nobody thinks about me, right?

01:14:37.285 --> 01:14:38.744
You tied her up?

01:14:41.371 --> 01:14:42.748
I can't believe it.

01:14:43.791 --> 01:14:46.210
- How long?
- Four days.

01:14:46.376 --> 01:14:47.502
- What?
- I don't know.

01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:50.005
No, maybe...
It was maybe three days. Three...

01:14:50.172 --> 01:14:53.216
Four days. Fuck!
I don't know! Fuck!

01:14:53.383 --> 01:14:57.220
I've heard some cruel shit in my day,
but that is some pretty fucked up shit.

01:14:57.387 --> 01:14:58.388
I know.

01:14:58.555 --> 01:15:01.100
- I thought you were a normal guy.
- I am a normal guy.

01:15:01.266 --> 01:15:02.768
No.

01:15:10.734 --> 01:15:14.571
Hey, look! Look, girl, it's that guy.
Check him out.

01:15:15.906 --> 01:15:20.620
- He looks like shit!
- No way, girl. He looks nice.

01:15:20.787 --> 01:15:23.998
Listen, man, I want to thank you
for bailing me out.

01:15:24.165 --> 01:15:26.208
Don't mention it, and I mean that.

01:15:26.416 --> 01:15:28.586
So where are you at?
What are you doing?

01:15:28.753 --> 01:15:31.755
<i>I'm a couple hours south of you.
I'm on my way now.</i>

01:15:32.089 --> 01:15:34.383
You like him, don't you?

01:15:35.342 --> 01:15:38.304
I turned another goddamned
motel into an ashtray.

01:15:39.221 --> 01:15:42.141
Barbecued it, huh? Attaboy!

01:15:43.059 --> 01:15:45.686
So, what's this?

01:15:45.852 --> 01:15:50.816
You're on your way?
Is this my two hours' notice?

01:16:15.966 --> 01:16:18.427
- April?
- Ross, where's Nikki?

01:16:19.636 --> 01:16:21.930
I dropped her off at the bus station
about a half-hour ago.

01:16:22.097 --> 01:16:24.475
She's probably halfway
to Vegas or something.

01:16:24.642 --> 01:16:26.519
Good. We need to take a ride.

01:16:26.685 --> 01:16:29.938
Fuck, man, I can't do that right now.
My room's fucked. I haven't slept...

01:16:30.105 --> 01:16:33.316
You need a ride somewhere,
asshole? Well, you know what?

01:16:33.483 --> 01:16:35.153
<i>Ross is giving me a ride today.</i>

01:16:35.319 --> 01:16:38.781
Okay? We're gonna go to the bus
station, we're gonna pick up Taco.

01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:42.326
Oh, baby needs to buy some more
chemicals? Poor, poor, poor baby.

01:16:42.492 --> 01:16:44.162
Poor little baby. Call a taxi.

01:16:44.329 --> 01:16:46.705
Loser! Loser! You lose!

01:16:48.999 --> 01:16:50.793
- Fuck, Nikki.
- I'm sorry.

01:16:51.711 --> 01:16:53.796
- I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry, man.

01:16:54.005 --> 01:16:57.508
Listen, you little motherfucker,
don't you ever fucking lie to me again!

01:16:57.675 --> 01:17:01.720
I know, I'm sorry. She was staring at me,
giving me the evil eye. I don't know...

01:17:01.888 --> 01:17:03.055
Listen to me.

01:17:03.222 --> 01:17:07.684
I want you to drop that crazy bitch off
right now and meet me at the market.

01:17:07.851 --> 01:17:09.186
I just wanted to tell you...

01:17:09.353 --> 01:17:12.064
No, just meet me
at the goddamned market! Bye.

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:16.486
You wanna fuck him, don't you?

01:17:16.694 --> 01:17:19.238
I can smell the snail trails
all over the store.

01:17:19.405 --> 01:17:21.406
Fuck you!
You always talking shit like that.

01:17:35.128 --> 01:17:37.381
Listen, can I use your backroom?

01:17:37.548 --> 01:17:40.300
- Yeah. It's right back there.
- Go ahead.

01:17:42.679 --> 01:17:45.139
- You like him, eh?
- Shut up. Stop bothering me.

01:17:45.306 --> 01:17:46.932
You're always bothering me.

01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:48.393
One guy looks at me too...

01:17:52.397 --> 01:17:55.817
My baby! Ross, look.

01:17:57.694 --> 01:17:59.361
I missed you so much.

01:17:59.528 --> 01:18:01.489
- Yes, you did.
- Hi, Taco.

01:18:01.655 --> 01:18:04.575
Looks like a perfectly healthy
green dog.

01:18:04.784 --> 01:18:06.368
This is great.

01:18:18.422 --> 01:18:20.008
Come on, sweet pea.

01:18:20.174 --> 01:18:22.384
- Las Vegas, huh?
- We're gonna go to Vegas.

01:18:22.552 --> 01:18:25.221
- Oh, I wish he was there.
- That would be good, right?

01:18:25.388 --> 01:18:29.600
- So Las Vegas is how long by bus?
- It's a seven-hour bus ride.

01:18:29.767 --> 01:18:32.603
Well, around seven hours.
Not so bad.

01:18:32.936 --> 01:18:36.189
- Oh, I don't have any cash.
- Here, sir.

01:18:37.191 --> 01:18:42.612
- I had a really good talk, you know?
- I had such an amazing time. Thank you.

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:45.742
Ross, if you ever make it
out to Vegas...

01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:48.160
...you have to call me.
Do you pinkie promise?

01:18:48.327 --> 01:18:51.539
- I pinkie... I pinkie promise.
- Thank you.

01:18:51.706 --> 01:18:54.125
Because I don't know if I'm ever
gonna come back here.

01:18:54.624 --> 01:18:55.959
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:18:56.461 --> 01:18:59.629
You know he wasn't mad at you, right?
He wasn't.

01:18:59.796 --> 01:19:02.425
- Come here, baby.
- That's not real.

01:19:07.804 --> 01:19:10.140
I like you even though
you're not a normal guy.

01:19:10.307 --> 01:19:11.975
I like you even though
you're not a normal girl.

01:19:13.185 --> 01:19:14.853
So let's just say goodbye.

01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:18.191
I just wanna say that I enjoyed
all this time that I spent with you.

01:19:18.358 --> 01:19:19.816
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:19:23.403 --> 01:19:25.073
Okay.

01:19:25.239 --> 01:19:26.281
Come here.

01:19:28.493 --> 01:19:29.827
Be safe.

01:19:30.828 --> 01:19:32.497
Well...

01:20:10.367 --> 01:20:13.663
- Good luck with Amy.
- Well, good luck in Las Vegas.

01:20:13.913 --> 01:20:17.207
- Just be yourself, okay?
- Thank you.

01:20:17.375 --> 01:20:19.126
All aboard, please.

01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:21.713
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:20:48.948 --> 01:20:53.911
<i>Hi, it's Amy. I'm not here, so leave
a message and I'll call you back.</i>

01:20:54.244 --> 01:20:58.582
Hey, Amy, it's Ross. I called before,
but it was busy, so I'm calling again.

01:20:58.750 --> 01:21:01.794
You know, I really need to talk to you,
so if you're there, pick up.

01:21:03.087 --> 01:21:06.174
I wanted to talk to you because
I haven't heard your voice...

01:21:06.341 --> 01:21:08.675
...and so I wanted to talk to you.
So please...

01:21:08.843 --> 01:21:11.888
...if you'd give me a call,
that'd be wonderful, and I love you.

01:21:12.096 --> 01:21:16.851
It's your machine,
and pick up if you're there.

01:21:17.018 --> 01:21:21.230
All right, it's Ross. I'll call back. Okay.

01:21:40.207 --> 01:21:41.959
- Have you seen...?
- He's in the backroom.

01:21:42.125 --> 01:21:43.835
- Chilling out.
- Back there?

01:21:44.002 --> 01:21:46.381
Yeah, back there.
You guys keep it quiet, okay?

01:21:46.547 --> 01:21:48.091
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:21:56.641 --> 01:22:00.560
Did you get the girl and the little dog
to the bus stop?

01:22:00.728 --> 01:22:04.022
- Yeah. She split?
- She's gone.

01:22:04.398 --> 01:22:05.817
She said she might come back.

01:22:05.983 --> 01:22:08.695
Hey, they always spin their way back,
you know?

01:22:08.861 --> 01:22:09.945
What do you want?

01:22:10.112 --> 01:22:12.657
<i>I thought I saw that guy.
Where is that pinche puto?</i>

01:22:12.823 --> 01:22:16.618
I don't know, but you better leave.
He could still be close by.

01:22:22.834 --> 01:22:25.544
- Can I have a beer?
- Oh, fuck, yeah.

01:22:26.421 --> 01:22:30.091
- Did he leave? He better watch himself.
- Holy fuck!

01:22:30.258 --> 01:22:31.342
That's fucking April!

01:22:32.176 --> 01:22:34.302
I bet you that fucking bitch
is afraid, huh?

01:22:34.511 --> 01:22:36.889
And she's with
my fucking dyke neighbor!

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:40.851
Get out of here!

01:22:41.018 --> 01:22:42.394
Hey, fuck you!

01:22:42.854 --> 01:22:45.481
- You don't need nothing?
- We don't need nothing from you.

01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:48.317
Who you gonna get it from then, huh?
Spider Mike?

01:22:48.526 --> 01:22:50.320
<i>The pinche maricÃ³n
was raided last night.</i>

01:22:50.486 --> 01:22:51.737
He got raided?

01:22:51.903 --> 01:22:54.866
I told you once already, just leave.
You better leave...

01:22:55.033 --> 01:22:56.700
...or there'll be trouble.
- Right.

01:22:56.867 --> 01:22:59.203
- Take your cigarettes and just go.
- Fuck the smokes!

01:23:00.038 --> 01:23:01.873
What I want is respect
from you bitches!

01:23:02.039 --> 01:23:04.167
Respect is earned, mud flap.

01:23:04.334 --> 01:23:08.837
Screaming at these women
is no way to earn any respect.

01:23:09.172 --> 01:23:13.216
These aren't women.
These are my fucking bitches, bitch!

01:23:21.850 --> 01:23:25.521
Man, look at that. Some of them dykes
are pretty goddamn good, huh?

01:23:26.689 --> 01:23:28.775
- You girls okay?
- Yeah.

01:23:29.025 --> 01:23:33.696
I don't like resorting to violence,
but men, they're evil.

01:23:33.862 --> 01:23:36.032
They need healing.

01:23:36.531 --> 01:23:38.117
- Here's for the beer.
- Okay.

01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:40.911
- Have a nice day.
- You too.

01:23:43.706 --> 01:23:46.083
Hey, want a bump?

01:23:46.416 --> 01:23:48.919
- Yeah, I need that right now.
- There you go.

01:24:01.391 --> 01:24:02.934
So Spider got busted.

01:24:05.561 --> 01:24:09.065
Yeah and that little faggot, Frisbee,
was wearing a goddamned wire.

01:24:09.232 --> 01:24:11.734
Get me out! It's bad! It's gone bad!

01:24:11.943 --> 01:24:13.276
Holy shit!

01:24:13.653 --> 01:24:16.947
Spider broke a cap off,
nailed him right in the nuts.

01:24:18.824 --> 01:24:20.326
Oh, shit!

01:24:20.575 --> 01:24:22.912
- Is he dead?
- No, he lived.

01:24:26.582 --> 01:24:28.000
That's gotta hurt.

01:24:29.001 --> 01:24:31.921
Jesus Christ, that's gotta hurt.

01:24:32.088 --> 01:24:34.297
- Is Cookie all right?
- She got busted.

01:24:36.509 --> 01:24:39.094
So where we going?

01:24:40.012 --> 01:24:41.431
Let's go to the city.

01:24:41.597 --> 01:24:43.598
The city? I don't... I can't, man.

01:24:43.807 --> 01:24:45.767
I can't go. I haven't slept in days.

01:24:45.977 --> 01:24:50.023
I'm too fucking high. The car is
on empty. I'm on E here. I just...

01:24:50.189 --> 01:24:53.191
- Why do we need to go to the city?
- Listen, pussy boy...

01:24:53.443 --> 01:24:56.112
...you're broke. I'm broke.

01:24:56.279 --> 01:25:00.116
My old lady split. Your old lady took off
with some fucking dyke.

01:25:00.283 --> 01:25:03.285
- So?
- So we gotta get some money.

01:25:03.493 --> 01:25:04.871
We gotta go there.

01:25:05.037 --> 01:25:07.206
That's where they got
dope and what we need.

01:25:07.373 --> 01:25:10.209
And when we go there,
then I'll take care of you, all right?

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.337
No, that's cool.
No, we should go there...

01:25:12.503 --> 01:25:14.713
...because my real girlfriend,
Amy's, there.

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.842
We're supposed to hang out,
so it's actually kind of perfect.

01:25:18.008 --> 01:25:19.635
We'll go to the city.

01:25:54.753 --> 01:25:56.589
I gotta stop and make a call.

01:25:56.756 --> 01:25:59.549
Goddamn it, pay-phone boy.
We're just up the road a bit.

01:25:59.716 --> 01:26:01.552
Just keep on driving.

01:26:13.231 --> 01:26:15.357
All right, wait here. I'll be right out.

01:26:28.328 --> 01:26:30.581
Four hundred diamond chips.
I've counted them.

01:26:30.831 --> 01:26:34.919
Given to me by a Hell's Angel.
I think his name was Charles.

01:26:36.336 --> 01:26:39.423
Hi! We've been waiting for you.
Where've you been?

01:26:39.589 --> 01:26:41.759
Okay, both of you, out of here.

01:26:42.343 --> 01:26:44.262
Out of here. Out of here. Out of here.

01:26:52.352 --> 01:26:53.438
Are you alone?

01:26:53.687 --> 01:26:56.565
I got a little helper with me, a little kid.

01:26:57.107 --> 01:26:58.901
Kid?

01:26:59.276 --> 01:27:00.903
Are you into that? Kids?

01:27:02.696 --> 01:27:06.951
<i>Hi, it's Amy. I'm not here, so leave
a message and I'll call you back.</i>

01:27:07.118 --> 01:27:09.369
<i>Hey, Amy, it's me.</i>

01:27:09.703 --> 01:27:12.039
I'm gonna be at the park
in about 20 minutes...

01:27:12.205 --> 01:27:13.957
...and I really wish you'd talk to me.

01:27:14.542 --> 01:27:17.670
Okay. Well, here's a little something.

01:27:19.296 --> 01:27:20.506
Nice.

01:27:20.673 --> 01:27:22.967
- That's good.
- And here's another.

01:27:23.134 --> 01:27:25.887
- Nicer.
- That's even better.

01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:29.057
I want you to know I have changed.

01:27:29.223 --> 01:27:33.102
I'm really, you know, trying to be good,
and I have your money.

01:27:33.269 --> 01:27:38.816
So I love you, and maybe
you'll come, okay? Bye.

01:27:39.233 --> 01:27:43.780
Everything you'll need, you'll find
in that jug, that can and that case.

01:27:45.823 --> 01:27:48.159
Okay.

01:27:57.584 --> 01:27:59.003
- Nice.
- Nice.

01:27:59.336 --> 01:28:01.963
- Okay, girls.
- Goodbye, lover-boy.

01:28:04.967 --> 01:28:05.967
Mark.

01:28:07.637 --> 01:28:09.347
Take a lesson, you two.

01:28:09.514 --> 01:28:13.476
That's a real man. Oh, yes!

01:28:13.685 --> 01:28:15.894
I love him.

01:28:51.514 --> 01:28:53.516
Okay, where to?

01:28:53.682 --> 01:28:54.934
I'll make you a deal.

01:28:56.019 --> 01:29:00.064
Six months' worth of dope.
Just give me a ride where I gotta go.

01:29:00.231 --> 01:29:03.109
Sounds good. Is it okay if I go
and see my girlfriend?

01:29:03.276 --> 01:29:04.777
I gotta see Amy first.

01:29:04.943 --> 01:29:06.028
Yeah, let's go.

01:29:06.778 --> 01:29:09.615
All right.

01:30:57.389 --> 01:30:58.683
Where's my money?

01:30:59.725 --> 01:31:01.643
Money.

01:31:02.812 --> 01:31:05.189
- There's plenty more where that's from.
- That's it?

01:31:05.356 --> 01:31:07.233
- Yeah.
- Impressive.

01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:09.026
Now you only owe me 350.

01:31:09.401 --> 01:31:13.156
Yeah, well, I got a job, you know,
now, and I'm working really hard.

01:31:13.323 --> 01:31:16.200
You know, I just...
God. Can I hold you just for a second?

01:31:16.367 --> 01:31:18.577
- Are you on crank?
- No!

01:31:18.745 --> 01:31:19.829
You're spun, aren't you?

01:31:19.996 --> 01:31:22.165
- No, I'm working hard!
- I can't deal with this!

01:31:22.372 --> 01:31:25.335
- No, I can't... What?
- I can't deal with this.

01:31:26.209 --> 01:31:28.046
What are you talking about?

01:31:28.212 --> 01:31:29.589
- I got a life now, okay?
- Look...

01:31:29.756 --> 01:31:31.674
Don't touch me!

01:31:35.303 --> 01:31:37.262
I'll call you.

01:31:40.224 --> 01:31:41.768
Fuck!

01:32:03.997 --> 01:32:07.502
I'm crashing pretty hard right now.
I'm really tired.

01:32:08.585 --> 01:32:11.004
That's not good.

01:32:27.772 --> 01:32:32.110
I remember a time,
I'll tell you, I was about...

01:32:32.276 --> 01:32:36.989
I was little. I don't know, 4, 5 years old,
something like that.

01:32:37.699 --> 01:32:42.536
We had this old dog
that had a litter of puppies.

01:32:42.703 --> 01:32:44.539
And I walked
in the bathroom one day...

01:32:44.706 --> 01:32:49.043
...and my mother was standing there,
kneeling down.

01:32:49.293 --> 01:32:52.421
The dog had a litter, about eight,
and my mother was bending over...

01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:57.217
...and she was killing each one
of these little puppies in the bathtub.

01:32:58.219 --> 01:33:01.264
And I remember, I said, "Why?"

01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:09.147
She said, "I'm just killing
what I can't take care of."

01:33:11.315 --> 01:33:16.571
Then my mama said to me...
She looked at me, she said:

01:33:18.072 --> 01:33:21.241
"I wish I could do that to you."

01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:27.164
Maybe she... Maybe she should've.

01:33:27.331 --> 01:33:29.167
Yeah.
