00:06.465 --> 00:08.467
<i>- [Egwene] Where's Nynaeve?
- She went
into the Arches,</i>

00:08.467 --> 00:10.052
<i>but she never came out.</i>

00:10.052 --> 00:12.346
Mummy, what's that?

00:13.848 --> 00:16.016
Come on, sweetheart,
we have to go.

00:20.146 --> 00:22.356
<i>When a Warder loses
his Aes Sedai,</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:25.317
<i>it's almost
like he's swallowed her death.</i>

00:25.317 --> 00:27.528
- I'm still your Warder.
- No, you failed me.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.697
Alanna will see you
to the Tower.

00:30.906 --> 00:32.575
<i>You really don't want
to know what I see</i>

00:32.575 --> 00:34.076
<i>- when I look at you?
- Absolutely not.</i>

00:34.994 --> 00:36.412
<i>Mat is coming with me.</i>

00:36.412 --> 00:37.997
You know the way?

00:37.997 --> 00:39.248
Don't let me down.

00:39.248 --> 00:40.708
<i>Lady Anvaere, don't you</i>

00:40.708 --> 00:43.085
<i>wonder why she wanted
to talk to you?</i>

00:43.085 --> 00:45.045
<i>What is your reason
for helping me?</i>

00:45.045 --> 00:47.298
<i>You'll help me remember.</i>

00:47.298 --> 00:49.759
<i>And I'll help you forget.</i>

00:49.759 --> 00:52.052
Let's go.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.513
<i>Run! He'll show you where.</i>

00:54.513 --> 00:56.724
<i>The whole dial
was covered in a poem,</i>

00:56.724 --> 00:58.017
<i>written in Old Tongue.</i>

00:58.017 --> 00:59.185
<i>We didn't
defeat the Dark One.</i>

00:59.185 --> 01:01.812
<i>We set his strongest lieutenant free.</i>

01:01.812 --> 01:03.898
<i>Ishmael may be waking
the other Forsaken.</i>

02:45.666 --> 02:48.586
Blood feeds blood.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.925
Blood calls blood.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.554
Blood is...

02:58.554 --> 03:00.639
blood was...

03:03.475 --> 03:07.187
...and blood shall ever be.

04:26.684 --> 04:28.435
My lady, there's, um...

04:28.435 --> 04:30.938
there's someone at the door.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.023
It's early for a visitor.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.068
Who?

04:36.068 --> 04:37.653
It's, um...

04:39.488 --> 04:41.073
It's your...

04:41.073 --> 04:42.950
older sister.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.752
Yes, my lady...

04:53.752 --> 04:56.130
If you'd just,
uh, c-come in here.

05:10.269 --> 05:11.854
You look well, little sister.

05:11.854 --> 05:14.314
As do you.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.734
Please, sit.

05:16.734 --> 05:18.277
- We didn't know...
- I won't trouble you for tea.

05:18.277 --> 05:19.987
I have stabled my horse,

05:19.987 --> 05:21.989
and I would use
my old room if it's open.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.199
But I want to keep a low profile
here in the city.

05:24.199 --> 05:25.701
Of course, we...

05:25.701 --> 05:28.495
Jhonas, bring up
a Ghaeldanin red

05:28.495 --> 05:30.039
- from the cellar?
- Yes, my lady.

05:30.039 --> 05:31.331
And I need
a dress ordered from...

05:31.331 --> 05:33.417
It's been decades, Moiraine!

05:33.417 --> 05:34.585
Sit.

05:40.758 --> 05:41.884
Have some tea.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.762
Perhaps lunch.

05:46.055 --> 05:47.347
There's someone I need
to meet this morning.

06:01.737 --> 06:04.031
If you rebuild my inn for me,
I can't charge you

06:04.031 --> 06:05.657
room and board anymore.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.367
It's the least I can do.

06:08.619 --> 06:09.536
I'm so sorry.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.246
It's not your fault.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.333
I didn't snuff the candles
before bed.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.378
Maybe it's for the best.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.797
I hired some men

06:19.797 --> 06:22.424
to rebuild this floor,
but it'll take them a week.

06:22.424 --> 06:24.676
Which means I have a chance

06:24.676 --> 06:26.970
to get away for the first time
in a long time.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.722
Where?

06:28.722 --> 06:30.933
My family have a cabin up
near Kinslayer's Dagger.

06:30.933 --> 06:33.435
I used to go there
all the time as a girl.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.605
But after I took over the inn...

06:39.608 --> 06:41.985
You want to come?

06:41.985 --> 06:44.071
Selene, I can't.

06:45.364 --> 06:46.907
Sorry.

06:46.907 --> 06:50.035
You say that one more time and
it's going to lose all meaning.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.954
I'm not good company right now.

06:51.954 --> 06:53.705
For anyone.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.668
Well, the fire drove off
all the other tenants.

06:57.668 --> 07:00.003
You'll have the whole place
to yourself.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.298
If you do really want
to be alone

07:03.298 --> 07:05.134
that is.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.118
<i>Come on, sweetheart,
we have to go.</i>

07:31.118 --> 07:32.953
<i>I'm scared.</i>

08:00.272 --> 08:01.982
Saved you some honeycakes.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.068
Thank you.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.820
How are you doing?

08:08.155 --> 08:10.032
I didn't sleep.

08:10.032 --> 08:12.117
I wouldn't, either, I suppose.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.662
- How does it feel?
- Um...

08:17.206 --> 08:19.041
I should go.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.792
Of course, I...

08:20.792 --> 08:23.003
I won't keep you.

08:25.464 --> 08:27.591
I'm here if you need anything.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.891
It's so good to have you back.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.435
It's all right now.

08:39.478 --> 08:40.604
It wasn't real.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.233
None of it was real.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.359
You know I want to,
but it's Ihvon...

09:27.359 --> 09:28.652
you have to convince.

09:28.652 --> 09:31.947
Please?
Please? Please?

09:31.947 --> 09:33.865
After I eat, after I eat.

09:45.544 --> 09:48.880
If anyone says anything about
the salt, I'll set you on fire.

09:50.674 --> 09:53.302
- I'm fine, thank you.
- You heard what I said
about fire?

09:53.302 --> 09:54.678
I'm still full from breakfast.

09:54.678 --> 09:56.847
It was two hours ago, at least.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.559
What are you two smirking about?

10:00.559 --> 10:03.437
It's been a while since you
brought a new man home, huh?

10:03.437 --> 10:06.481
We thought maybe you were
slowing down in your old age.

10:06.481 --> 10:09.609
Where does
the third one go now?

10:13.071 --> 10:15.073
Mm-mm.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.545
Ihvon and Maksim busy?

10:28.545 --> 10:31.089
Huh?

10:31.089 --> 10:33.425
One of them always checks on me
when I step away.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.510
How does it usually go?

10:36.678 --> 10:38.972
Well, they open with a joke.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.141
Maksim, at my age.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.226
Ihvon, at my hair.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.480
Then...

10:46.480 --> 10:48.774
a warm memory.

10:48.774 --> 10:50.484
Something worth living for.

10:50.484 --> 10:51.902
And at that point...

10:51.902 --> 10:53.362
So we're going to skip
all of that.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.532
I don't think
you're gonna kill yourself.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.369
Your bond wasn't ripped
from you.

11:00.369 --> 11:01.703
She took it.

11:03.914 --> 11:06.583
So have you decided
what you're going to do now?

11:07.626 --> 11:09.169
Have I worn out my welcome?

11:09.169 --> 11:12.798
The three of us, we are going
back to the Tower tomorrow.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.633
Will you come with us?

11:16.468 --> 11:18.470
I don't know.

11:22.891 --> 11:25.519
Nynaeve is going
into the Arches.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.899
The fastest anyone's done
since Cadsuane Sedai.

11:30.899 --> 11:33.276
I suspect it's only
a matter of time

11:33.276 --> 11:35.654
until she's looking
for a Warder herself.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.578
I'm not looking
to repeat my failures.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.835
I wish you could've known
Moiraine before.

11:53.255 --> 11:54.423
Before what?

11:56.299 --> 11:57.926
Something happened to her.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.887
About 20 years ago now.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.849
A year or two
before she bonded you.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.894
One day she was simply...

12:07.894 --> 12:09.980
changed.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.357
The way water becomes ice,

12:12.357 --> 12:15.902
and you look at it and wonder
how it was ever water before.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.740
Was she happier, then?

12:20.740 --> 12:22.659
I don't know.

12:22.659 --> 12:25.412
I don't know
if she's ever been happy.

13:37.776 --> 13:39.653
And the redheaded
boy, he comes every day?

13:39.653 --> 13:41.738
- Rand?
- Indeed.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.491
Rand hasn't shown up
to work today.

13:44.491 --> 13:45.825
Ah.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.619
You don't know where he lives?

13:48.995 --> 13:51.122
Is he in some kind
of trouble, my lady?

13:52.499 --> 13:55.418
I'd like some time alone
with your ward.

13:56.461 --> 13:57.546
You know the one.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.110
I should kill you
where you stand.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.404
You tried that once.

14:25.574 --> 14:28.201
So how are they treating you?

14:28.201 --> 14:30.203
Like a butterfly without wings.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.955
And your mind?

14:36.293 --> 14:37.711
You're the reason I'm here

14:37.711 --> 14:39.379
instead of a cell
in the White Tower.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.548
My Yellow sisters wanted
to study you.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.593
As did the Browns, and I doubt
you would've enjoyed, either.

14:44.593 --> 14:48.054
I doubt my enjoyment
means all that much to you.

14:49.848 --> 14:51.683
Have you started
training him yet?

14:53.393 --> 14:55.270
Rand al'Thor.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.733
You sent him here, too?

15:00.734 --> 15:02.986
Where is he staying?

15:11.995 --> 15:13.997
You took everything from me.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.667
Everything.

15:18.793 --> 15:21.212
Do you really think
I'll dance on your strings

15:21.212 --> 15:22.881
for a bottle of wine?

15:22.881 --> 15:24.549
No.

15:24.549 --> 15:27.344
I know what you really want.

15:27.344 --> 15:29.262
What all those

15:29.262 --> 15:32.098
cut off from the One Power

15:32.098 --> 15:34.184
desire most of all.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.486
You help me.

15:44.486 --> 15:46.196
And I'll help you.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.700
Where's he staying?

15:50.700 --> 15:52.869
He's staying at an inn.

15:54.829 --> 15:57.374
In the Foregate. The Crescent.

15:57.374 --> 15:59.209
And?

16:01.211 --> 16:03.797
The boy has
as much power as I did.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.884
But he fears it.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.637
Hates it,
so he cannot control it.

16:12.847 --> 16:15.725
You will teach him everything
you know about channeling.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.894
Everything.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.771
However long it takes.

16:19.771 --> 16:22.357
And at the end, if I'm
satisfied with his progress...

16:27.779 --> 16:29.823
...I'll leave
the knife with you.

16:42.794 --> 16:45.839
Something's different between us
since she came back.

16:45.839 --> 16:48.341
She's an Accepted now.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.551
It's not that.

16:51.428 --> 16:53.096
Maybe a little that.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.807
But no matter
how much I want to help,

16:55.807 --> 16:58.393
I can't seem to say or do
the right thing.

16:58.393 --> 17:00.353
Then stop trying.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.564
You don't even know
what happened to her in there.

17:02.564 --> 17:04.524
Why do you feel
like you have to fix it?

17:05.567 --> 17:07.026
'Cause I'm her friend.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.738
She was there for me
last year when I lost...

17:11.448 --> 17:14.159
...someone I love
more than anything.

17:14.159 --> 17:17.120
And I only got through it
because I had her to hold me up.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.497
Even though
she was hurting, too.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.459
And I want to be...

17:22.459 --> 17:25.003
I should be the same for her.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.008
Like I used to be.

17:30.008 --> 17:32.510
But ever since I came here

17:32.510 --> 17:34.804
to this Tower, I just feel...

17:34.804 --> 17:37.807
smaller and smaller.

18:06.669 --> 18:09.047
You must be Nynaeve al'Meara,
aren't you?

18:09.047 --> 18:11.090
I'm just looking
for Maksim and Ihvon.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.594
They're away with Alanna Sedai,
but I can train with you

18:14.594 --> 18:17.013
if you want.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.891
Did you really channel
in the Arches?

18:21.643 --> 18:24.145
I'm surprised you don't have all
the Ajahs following you around.

18:25.814 --> 18:27.941
I mean, you have years
to choose, I just...

18:27.941 --> 18:29.567
I just hope it's not Red.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.265
The western shore is
under attack

19:00.265 --> 19:02.725
and you're not sending
any sisters to deal with it.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.727
The west is always under attack,

19:04.727 --> 19:06.563
usually from itself.

19:07.939 --> 19:10.149
And the Tower has sent sisters
to investigate.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.777
When did they last
send a report?

19:19.534 --> 19:21.244
Is the Amyrlin aware?

19:21.244 --> 19:23.246
Of course.

19:24.956 --> 19:27.166
When did you
last speak with her?

19:32.672 --> 19:35.925
The Keeper rules the Tower
when the Amyrlin is away.

19:35.925 --> 19:39.012
So I speak with the Amyrlin

19:39.012 --> 19:41.639
every time I open my mouth.

19:41.639 --> 19:43.725
Oh.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.733
You know, if she falls...

19:53.443 --> 19:55.445
...you'll fall with her.

20:20.678 --> 20:23.473
Look, we haven't seen
any sign of the caravan

20:23.473 --> 20:25.475
for hours now.

20:25.475 --> 20:28.186
I need to find my friends.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.813
Are you sure we're even going
the right way?

20:30.813 --> 20:32.357
Wolves don't get lost.

20:32.357 --> 20:34.734
You're the one leading us,
not them.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.402
Look at me, boy.

20:41.115 --> 20:43.117
I am them.

20:44.369 --> 20:46.120
So are you.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.793
What are we?

20:51.793 --> 20:53.878
Wolfbrother, they call us.

20:55.296 --> 20:58.383
- What does that mean?
- Exactly what it sounds like.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.803
Are they all wolfbrothers?

21:01.803 --> 21:03.763
Am I going to change into...?

21:03.763 --> 21:05.264
Don't be stupid.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.141
How did you find me?

21:18.736 --> 21:20.947
It's our language.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.534
One of our scouts
spotted a buck.

21:24.534 --> 21:27.328
Sent that vision
to lead us to it.

21:27.328 --> 21:29.247
- How does it work?
- Instinct.

21:29.247 --> 21:31.374
You'll learn what they mean,
how to send them.

21:31.374 --> 21:32.959
Did the wolves warn you

21:32.959 --> 21:34.627
those warriors
were coming for us?

21:36.004 --> 21:38.631
Is that why you didn't stay
in the village?

21:38.631 --> 21:40.216
You could have warned us.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.510
You could have helped.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.512
Are you in chains?

21:46.931 --> 21:48.016
Time to eat.

22:02.572 --> 22:04.741
You'll lose the taste
for cooked flesh soon enough.

22:09.203 --> 22:11.039
He likes you.

22:16.377 --> 22:18.421
What's his name?

22:18.421 --> 22:20.006
He'll show you when he's ready.

22:26.387 --> 22:28.765
We've had our eye on you
for a long time.

22:31.642 --> 22:33.227
You're lucky we were there
to save you

22:33.227 --> 22:34.812
and that girl
from the Whitecloaks.

22:37.899 --> 22:39.984
That was you?

22:39.984 --> 22:41.277
How?

22:41.277 --> 22:43.821
You've been sending us images
for months now.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.078
He lost his mate, too.

22:50.078 --> 22:52.580
He mourns her still.

23:01.964 --> 23:04.383
We all see her when you sleep.

23:13.476 --> 23:15.770
Why did you wait so long
to come to me?

23:17.105 --> 23:19.607
If you've been following me
for months.

23:19.607 --> 23:22.610
We don't go near
women who can channel.

23:22.610 --> 23:24.904
Why not?

23:24.904 --> 23:27.907
Aes Sedai don't trust
what they don't understand.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.619
Neither does any other human.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.404
Hopper.

24:08.156 --> 24:09.866
That's his name.

24:09.866 --> 24:11.492
Close enough.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.147
They've already started
making dinner.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.231
Help me with the water?

24:48.362 --> 24:49.906
How much water
can they need for bread?

24:58.915 --> 25:00.458
You're doing really well.

25:00.458 --> 25:02.126
You know that, right?

25:02.126 --> 25:05.671
Usually, the first few weeks
after the bond's been broken...

25:08.090 --> 25:09.592
Well...

25:10.635 --> 25:11.969
I don't need to tell you.

25:13.471 --> 25:16.307
Well, I've had my share
of practice without it.

25:19.769 --> 25:22.313
Moiraine has left the bond
masked for...

25:24.065 --> 25:25.566
...the last six months or so.

25:25.566 --> 25:28.361
I thought I was the only Warder
who could go that long.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.033
When Alanna first bonded me,

25:34.033 --> 25:36.202
it was miserable for everyone.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.537
I didn't like
having an audience in my head,

25:38.537 --> 25:40.122
and she didn't like the show.

25:41.123 --> 25:43.876
So, the three of us
talked it through,

25:43.876 --> 25:45.628
and we decided

25:45.628 --> 25:47.838
that she would mask her bond
with me.

25:47.838 --> 25:49.507
Except in battle.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.802
And bed.

25:55.388 --> 25:56.973
Does the Tower know about this?

26:01.811 --> 26:03.771
Have you ever known a marriage

26:03.771 --> 26:05.940
that is exactly the same
as another?

26:09.986 --> 26:13.489
I know the others will tell you
you can't go back to Moiraine.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.908
But I'm proof that you can.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.827
If you want to.

26:55.906 --> 26:57.325
The Crescent Inn burned down.

26:57.325 --> 26:58.993
Do you know why?

26:58.993 --> 27:01.370
Things burn in the Foregate
all the time, my lady.

27:01.370 --> 27:03.831
Shame it didn't take
the buildings around.

27:04.832 --> 27:06.792
There was a boy staying there.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.002
Red hair.

27:08.002 --> 27:11.047
I know that gets attention here
at least.

27:11.047 --> 27:12.298
You would have seen him
every day

27:12.298 --> 27:13.924
come through these gates
for work.

27:13.924 --> 27:15.426
What about him?

27:17.136 --> 27:18.471
Do you know where he is now?

27:34.653 --> 27:36.364
This is...

27:36.364 --> 27:38.407
incredible.

27:42.203 --> 27:44.205
Did your family
build their cabin?

27:46.749 --> 27:48.501
I was lying.

27:49.794 --> 27:52.213
I never used to come up here
as a kid.

27:53.214 --> 27:55.341
I used to come with a man.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.259
The one before you.

27:57.259 --> 27:58.427
Well, you don't have to explain.

27:58.427 --> 28:00.846
We promised-- no pasts.

28:00.846 --> 28:03.557
Easy for you, since you're
too young to have one.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.853
You'd be surprised.

28:14.485 --> 28:16.946
He was the first man
I ever loved.

28:18.406 --> 28:20.282
The only, actually.

28:21.575 --> 28:22.701
Powerful.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.328
Confident.

28:25.496 --> 28:27.039
Arrogant, really.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.210
With eyes that could fix
everything in its place.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.213
Sounds a bit boring.

28:36.841 --> 28:39.093
We used to get away
as much as we could.

28:39.093 --> 28:41.262
We were always better
when we were alone,

28:41.262 --> 28:43.848
without the world
pulling us in every direction.

28:46.016 --> 28:49.687
We used to joke
about never coming back down.

28:49.687 --> 28:52.690
But we always did.

29:03.117 --> 29:05.202
I grew up somewhere like this.

29:07.121 --> 29:10.958
My friends, they used to dream
of cities and... traveling.

29:12.001 --> 29:13.544
But not me.

29:15.838 --> 29:17.798
Up here,

29:17.798 --> 29:21.051
the world looks like
it still fits together.

29:24.013 --> 29:26.974
I can believe it's not broken.

29:26.974 --> 29:28.976
You want to go back there?

29:28.976 --> 29:31.270
The Wheel never gives anyone
what they want.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.276
Least of all me.

29:39.028 --> 29:43.240
No one and nothing
ever gives you what you want.

29:45.242 --> 29:46.994
If you want something,

29:46.994 --> 29:49.330
you have to take it.

30:11.936 --> 30:13.020
Ooh.

30:14.438 --> 30:15.648
Right.

30:15.648 --> 30:16.982
Hey, mate! Same again.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.818
- How are you paying for those?
I've got all your money.
- No.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.403
You can't win all night.

30:21.403 --> 30:23.572
Says the man
who can't see the future.

30:23.572 --> 30:27.660
No, you said you can only see
people's futures.

30:30.120 --> 30:33.707
Right. Well,
since you are rolling in it

30:33.707 --> 30:35.209
and we've been riding all day,

30:35.209 --> 30:37.127
why don't you get us a room?

30:38.128 --> 30:39.046
I am tired.

30:39.046 --> 30:40.130
I can't move.

30:40.130 --> 30:41.465
I've heard that before.

30:41.465 --> 30:44.802
How about I'll get us
another round

30:44.802 --> 30:46.011
and rooms?

30:46.011 --> 30:47.096
Plural.

30:54.728 --> 30:55.771
You didn't drink that much.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.690
He will in a couple of hours.

30:57.690 --> 31:00.609
Just needs a helping hand.

31:02.319 --> 31:03.571
Assume you'll be needing a room?

31:03.571 --> 31:05.406
The attic.

31:05.406 --> 31:06.991
There should be someone
meeting me there.

31:06.991 --> 31:08.576
Have they arrived yet?

31:08.576 --> 31:09.868
No, not yet.

31:09.868 --> 31:10.953
Who are you meeting?

31:11.996 --> 31:13.914
I'm not entirely sure.

31:13.914 --> 31:15.583
But send them up
when they get here.

31:15.583 --> 31:17.167
They'll be asking
for the same room.

31:30.556 --> 31:34.768
Most Aes Sedai refuse to set
foot in this room ever again.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.151
Was any of it real?

31:51.118 --> 31:52.620
The pain.

31:55.039 --> 31:56.665
But even that fades.

31:57.666 --> 31:59.293
In time.

32:03.964 --> 32:05.966
Who did you lose inside?

32:13.849 --> 32:15.100
My daughter.

32:17.519 --> 32:18.687
I'm sorry.

32:19.730 --> 32:20.814
I'm supposed to just forget her

32:20.814 --> 32:22.733
and everything
that happened in there.

32:23.734 --> 32:25.986
I was in there for years.

32:27.655 --> 32:30.574
And it's fading,
but I-I still remember it.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.619
I...

32:36.538 --> 32:39.625
I've kept my son a secret for...

32:40.876 --> 32:42.628
...80 years now, 90?

32:44.380 --> 32:47.174
I told myself it was
for his own protection.

32:47.174 --> 32:49.802
Stop my enemies

32:49.802 --> 32:51.720
from hurting him to get to me.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.643
The Three Oaths bind us
to speak the truth to others,

32:57.643 --> 32:59.228
not ourselves.

33:00.270 --> 33:02.481
I could've hidden him anywhere,

33:02.481 --> 33:04.233
probably
a thousand safer places,

33:04.233 --> 33:05.984
but I kept him here
in Tar Valon.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.528
I kept him here for me.

33:08.529 --> 33:10.280
Because I was afraid.

33:13.033 --> 33:15.285
I couldn't risk losing
the only thing in this world

33:15.285 --> 33:17.162
that's ever been truly mine.

33:22.126 --> 33:23.961
Men who can...

33:23.961 --> 33:26.839
channel are cursed by the Dark, because...

33:26.839 --> 33:28.590
of the madness.

33:30.592 --> 33:33.762
Because they eventually kill
the people they love the most.

33:33.762 --> 33:36.765
But the truth is,
we Aes Sedai...

33:36.765 --> 33:38.559
are cursed, too.

33:40.436 --> 33:43.564
The One Power
slows down our aging, and...

33:43.564 --> 33:48.694
we have to sit and watch the
people we love pass by instead,

33:48.694 --> 33:51.113
helpless to stop it.

33:55.951 --> 33:58.954
I can see why they don't
let you teach novices.

34:04.293 --> 34:06.712
You want to know how we...

34:06.712 --> 34:08.714
rule this world
without collapsing

34:08.714 --> 34:10.507
from the pain and loss?

34:12.676 --> 34:15.679
You find a piece of this world
that belongs to you

34:15.679 --> 34:17.473
and you...

34:17.473 --> 34:19.141
hold on to it.

34:20.476 --> 34:22.060
And then...

34:24.480 --> 34:27.608
...when it's finally gone,
you-you find another.

34:28.901 --> 34:31.487
Have you?

34:31.487 --> 34:33.155
Found another?

34:39.953 --> 34:41.538
I'm going
to tell you something now,

34:41.538 --> 34:43.791
but I want you
to give me your word...

34:45.167 --> 34:47.628
...you won't do anything rash.

34:51.256 --> 34:56.345
The Tower has learned of some
kind of invasion in the west.

34:56.345 --> 34:58.013
Nobody here cares.

34:59.181 --> 35:00.682
Especially since our spies report

35:00.682 --> 35:01.850
they haven't taken
many prisoners.

35:01.850 --> 35:04.019
But in one of the reports,

35:04.019 --> 35:06.814
they did capture
something unusual.

35:09.399 --> 35:12.903
A group of Shienaran soldiers
a long way from home.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.533
Traveling with an Ogier.

35:18.575 --> 35:20.828
And a blacksmith
from the Two Rivers.

35:50.315 --> 35:53.151
He lasted ten minutes
this time.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.487
I think we're wearing him down.

35:55.487 --> 35:56.905
Mm.

35:56.905 --> 35:59.533
Pretty soon,
he'll be old and wise like us.

35:59.533 --> 36:03.662
Old, yes.

36:05.038 --> 36:07.416
He's still working
on that wisdom.

36:19.469 --> 36:21.597
It's something she said.

36:23.265 --> 36:26.852
You keep saying it to yourself
over and over.

36:28.103 --> 36:30.772
A thousand cuts for her one.

36:38.322 --> 36:41.491
People don't understand
that we quiet ones...

36:42.492 --> 36:46.038
...are quiet because
the conversation's always...

36:46.038 --> 36:48.957
playing out in our own heads.

36:56.632 --> 36:57.799
She said that,

36:57.799 --> 36:59.468
all these years...

36:59.468 --> 37:00.802
Mm.

37:02.262 --> 37:04.848
...she never considered me
an equal.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.812
Of course not.

37:10.812 --> 37:12.522
We are not their equals, Lan.

37:12.522 --> 37:14.274
We're not supposed to be.

37:14.274 --> 37:16.485
An Aes Sedai can...

37:16.485 --> 37:19.821
call down lightning,
raise mountains.

37:19.821 --> 37:23.241
The rest of the world
only sees their power.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.911
We see their weakness.

37:25.911 --> 37:28.413
We remind them
that they are not gods.

37:29.456 --> 37:31.124
I wouldn't think that...

37:31.124 --> 37:32.668
Alanna needed a reminder.

37:32.668 --> 37:36.088
Yeah, well, she knows
we want the same thing as her.

37:37.130 --> 37:38.173
What's that?

37:40.175 --> 37:42.803
The triumph of the Light
over the Dark.

37:44.388 --> 37:45.889
And dessert after.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.898
What about Moiraine?

37:54.898 --> 37:56.984
What does she want?

38:03.907 --> 38:06.243
Maybe that's the problem.

38:06.243 --> 38:08.829
I don't think I know anymore.

39:11.850 --> 39:14.895
You'll pardon the intrusion,
but I didn't want to miss you.

39:15.896 --> 39:16.980
Please, sit.

39:16.980 --> 39:20.609
Anvaere.
I've had a long day. I...

39:20.609 --> 39:23.070
This is not what a woman
should have to do to talk

39:23.070 --> 39:25.697
to the sister she spent half
her life idolizing.

39:26.698 --> 39:30.202
If you want me
to apologize for leaving,

39:30.202 --> 39:32.204
I won't.

39:32.204 --> 39:33.789
An Aes Sedai cannot lie.

39:33.789 --> 39:34.998
No, no, of course not.

39:34.998 --> 39:37.626
In truth,
you did nothing I wouldn't have,

39:37.626 --> 39:38.710
if I could've channeled.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.670
Light knows I tried,

39:40.670 --> 39:43.882
on nights when
our family's future looked dim.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.802
After Uncle ruined us.

39:46.802 --> 39:48.178
After you left.

39:48.178 --> 39:51.056
But Father always held out hope

39:51.056 --> 39:54.851
that one day you'd return
and fix it all.

39:54.851 --> 39:57.270
You were his shining star.

39:57.270 --> 39:59.564
Shooting star, as it turned out,

39:59.564 --> 40:01.691
never to return
once you left our sky.

40:01.691 --> 40:03.318
I...

40:06.029 --> 40:07.280
I would have come back
if I could...

40:07.280 --> 40:09.449
Spare me the false penitence.

40:09.449 --> 40:11.910
You had your work,
and I had mine.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.162
Less important, certainly,

40:14.162 --> 40:16.248
but no less demanding.

40:16.248 --> 40:18.500
Unless the Tower also taught you

40:18.500 --> 40:20.752
how to smile
after someone spits in your eye?

40:20.752 --> 40:22.921
Or how to beg
a neighbor's housemaid

40:22.921 --> 40:24.798
for a party's leftovers?

40:24.798 --> 40:26.383
But I got on with my work,

40:26.383 --> 40:29.469
just as you did with yours.

40:29.469 --> 40:32.806
Now my son
is going to marry the queen,

40:32.806 --> 40:37.227
and nobody will ever spit
on House Damodred again.

40:40.689 --> 40:42.524
You've done well, little sister.

40:43.525 --> 40:45.861
Better than I would have done
with the hand you were dealt.

40:47.737 --> 40:49.573
Thank you, Moiraine.

40:49.573 --> 40:52.576
But somehow, finally,
I don't care what you think.

40:52.576 --> 40:55.370
I'm not here for your approval.

40:55.370 --> 40:57.706
I'm here
because you will not endanger

40:57.706 --> 41:00.417
what I've worked all my life
to build.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.464
This is not your house.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.675
This is not your city.

41:08.675 --> 41:11.511
And I'm not
your little sister anymore.

41:12.554 --> 41:15.056
All the eyes and ears
you had here...

41:16.057 --> 41:18.310
...they're mine now.

41:18.310 --> 41:20.770
The head of the sanitarium, Celestin.

41:20.770 --> 41:22.856
The guard you hailed
at the gate,

41:22.856 --> 41:24.900
Sandair.

41:24.900 --> 41:29.029
If you want to know where that
redheaded boy in the inn went...

41:30.530 --> 41:34.868
...you're going to have
to ask me very nicely over tea.

41:54.054 --> 41:55.931
It must be nice for you,
in a way.

41:56.932 --> 41:58.850
To know what you're going
to be someday.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.061
You know, the only thing
I ever wonder about

42:01.061 --> 42:03.563
is what it must be like
to get to choose your own fate.

42:05.815 --> 42:07.275
Want to trade?

42:09.069 --> 42:09.986
No.

42:14.115 --> 42:16.868
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

42:16.868 --> 42:18.954
Give us a moment.

42:18.954 --> 42:20.205
This is my room.

42:25.377 --> 42:27.671
And my glass I need to wash.

42:29.422 --> 42:31.549
I, uh, I was just coming

42:31.549 --> 42:34.636
- to find you...
- Perrin and Loial
have been captured.

42:34.636 --> 42:36.471
I'm going to Falme to free them.

42:36.471 --> 42:38.640
Falme? That's on
the other side of the world.

42:38.640 --> 42:41.101
I just came to tell you
that I'm leaving.

42:41.101 --> 42:42.852
You don't have to come.

42:42.852 --> 42:45.563
I'm an Accepted, I can leave
the Tower whenever I want.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.607
But if they catch you,
they'll expel you.

42:47.607 --> 42:49.776
You think I care about that?

42:49.776 --> 42:51.361
If our friends are in trouble,

42:51.361 --> 42:53.196
why would you think
I'd ever stay here?

43:00.745 --> 43:02.914
You don't get it at all, do you?

43:02.914 --> 43:05.959
Why I've tried so hard here?

43:05.959 --> 43:08.670
If I'd have been ready
at the Eye of the World...

43:09.796 --> 43:12.382
...I could've fought
alongside Rand.

43:12.382 --> 43:15.385
And maybe
he would've made it back.

43:18.305 --> 43:20.223
I'm never gonna fail any of you

43:20.223 --> 43:22.434
like that ever again.

43:24.686 --> 43:26.688
I know a safe way out.

43:37.907 --> 43:39.492
Are Perrin and Loial all right?

43:39.492 --> 43:41.036
I don't know.

43:41.036 --> 43:42.495
Well, who took them?

43:42.495 --> 43:45.206
Invaders from the west
is all I heard.

43:47.500 --> 43:49.419
It's a long ride to Falme.

43:49.419 --> 43:51.504
We'll have some time
to come up with a plan.

43:57.218 --> 43:59.095
Yes, I'm following you, obviously.

43:59.095 --> 44:01.222
To find out why you're
sneaking out of the Tower.

44:01.222 --> 44:03.516
Go back right now
and keep your mouth shut or...

44:03.516 --> 44:06.436
Or you'll what?
Egwene wouldn't hurt me.

44:06.436 --> 44:08.021
And you can't even
embrace the Source.

44:10.940 --> 44:12.484
Liandrin Sedai.

44:16.821 --> 44:18.073
I brought them here.

44:18.073 --> 44:19.407
They didn't do anything wrong.

44:19.407 --> 44:21.242
You can blame me.

44:23.536 --> 44:25.538
You are a complication.

44:29.417 --> 44:30.752
I am sorry for this.

44:52.690 --> 44:54.192
What are you doing in bed?

44:54.192 --> 44:55.568
- Get up! Come on then!
- Get up!

44:55.568 --> 44:57.445
- Time to work!
- The customers are waiting!

44:57.445 --> 44:59.614
This isn't happening, Auntie.

44:59.614 --> 45:01.366
I escaped.

45:01.366 --> 45:02.784
No one escapes their fate.

45:02.784 --> 45:05.745
You know that
better than anyone.

45:10.834 --> 45:12.168
Will we be happy together?

45:17.132 --> 45:18.967
What will I be
when I grow older?

45:21.261 --> 45:23.430
No! No!

45:28.184 --> 45:30.186
Open your eyes.

45:35.525 --> 45:37.527
What do you see?

45:42.323 --> 45:44.242
It's wonderful, isn't it?

45:44.242 --> 45:46.286
Seeing nothing.

45:46.286 --> 45:47.704
No longer being
a carnival attraction.

45:47.704 --> 45:49.164
Who are you?

45:49.164 --> 45:52.542
I've got so many names
in this age.

45:52.542 --> 45:53.918
Father of Lies.

45:53.918 --> 45:55.170
Betrayer of Hope.

45:55.170 --> 45:57.297
Forsaken.

45:58.673 --> 46:01.050
No, no,
Liandrin didn't tell me...

46:01.050 --> 46:05.180
She promised
to take away your visions.

46:05.180 --> 46:08.892
Do you really think
an Aes Sedai could do that?

46:10.560 --> 46:14.522
For some things, the Dark is
the only place to turn.

46:14.522 --> 46:16.566
The deal's off. I won't...

46:19.819 --> 46:21.488
I won't help you hurt anyone.

46:21.488 --> 46:23.656
You will.

46:26.701 --> 46:27.994
I won't let you hurt Mat.

46:29.454 --> 46:31.498
You might.

46:32.540 --> 46:34.667
You came here
to get instructions

46:34.667 --> 46:37.128
for where you're
to take him next.

46:38.296 --> 46:41.549
You want me
to take away your curse?

46:41.549 --> 46:44.010
Bring him to Cairhien.

46:53.937 --> 46:56.272
What's in Cairhien?

48:10.888 --> 48:12.307
Rand!

48:25.903 --> 48:27.405
Stay behind me.

48:48.092 --> 48:50.136
I'm sorry.

48:50.136 --> 48:51.929
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry!

48:51.929 --> 48:53.973
What did you just do?

48:53.973 --> 48:55.850
- I should've told you, I...
- Did you...?

48:55.850 --> 48:58.478
- I-I thought I could stop it.
- Did you just channel?

48:58.478 --> 49:00.563
I should've told you.

49:05.026 --> 49:06.569
The fire at my inn?

49:06.569 --> 49:09.322
No, no, that was an accident.
It was an accident.

49:10.365 --> 49:11.866
What kind of an accident?

49:11.866 --> 49:13.284
I haven't gone mad.

49:14.702 --> 49:16.704
I haven't gone mad.

49:21.250 --> 49:23.878
And y-you know that.

49:23.878 --> 49:26.381
You know me, right?

49:43.731 --> 49:45.400
I understand.

49:50.780 --> 49:52.657
I'm going to leave now.

49:52.657 --> 49:55.576
Thank you... for everything.

49:55.576 --> 49:57.662
I just wish we...

50:00.915 --> 50:03.209
Doesn't matter.

50:05.378 --> 50:07.380
Where will you go?

50:10.174 --> 50:12.969
They say when men go mad...

50:12.969 --> 50:16.013
they kill the people
they love first.

50:21.519 --> 50:24.021
So I'll go as far away as I can.

50:27.024 --> 50:28.860
Are you saying you love me?

50:36.659 --> 50:39.537
Why didn't you tell me
you can channel?

50:42.749 --> 50:46.586
You are the first woman
who's ever seen me as a man.

50:48.254 --> 50:51.215
I didn't want you
to see me as a monster.

51:00.308 --> 51:02.310
You're not.

51:07.523 --> 51:10.818
What you did,
it's just part of your nature.

51:12.236 --> 51:14.238
You shouldn't hide it.

51:17.575 --> 51:19.577
I did that once.

51:20.620 --> 51:22.622
Turned my soul
to him like a mirror,

51:22.622 --> 51:24.582
reflecting only
what he wanted to see.

51:24.582 --> 51:27.251
Leaving the rest of me
in darkness.

51:29.921 --> 51:32.340
But one day he looked too long.

51:32.340 --> 51:34.342
Too carefully.

51:39.806 --> 51:42.725
You need to give someone
the chance to love all of you.

51:43.976 --> 51:45.978
They might not.

51:47.188 --> 51:48.898
But you have
to give them the chance.

51:48.898 --> 51:51.275
I don't know
how much time we have.

51:52.860 --> 51:54.445
Until I...

51:54.445 --> 51:56.531
The same as everyone else.

51:57.907 --> 51:59.909
Never enough.

52:14.924 --> 52:16.717
Sure he's asleep?

52:16.717 --> 52:18.469
- Yeah.
- What did you find?

52:18.469 --> 52:20.930
A prophecy in the Old Tongue.

52:26.686 --> 52:29.397
Lan must not know
who it's about.

52:29.397 --> 52:31.148
Lanfear.

52:31.148 --> 52:33.234
The Forsaken.

52:33.234 --> 52:35.987
Her Seal is broken.

52:37.029 --> 52:39.073
She's in our world again.

52:42.118 --> 52:44.120
"Daughter of the Night.

52:44.120 --> 52:46.372
She walks again.

52:46.372 --> 52:49.625
The ancient war, she yet fights.

52:50.877 --> 52:53.254
<i>Her new lover she seeks,</i>

52:53.254 --> 52:56.173
who shall serve her and die,

52:56.173 --> 52:58.092
<i>yet serve still."</i>

52:59.427 --> 53:01.137
Uh, Selene?

53:01.137 --> 53:03.306
"Who shall stand
against her coming?"

53:08.811 --> 53:11.272
<i>"The Shining Walls
shall kneel.</i>

53:13.608 --> 53:16.611
Blood feeds blood.

53:16.611 --> 53:19.864
<i>Blood calls blood.</i>

53:21.574 --> 53:23.451
<i>Blood is,</i>

53:23.451 --> 53:25.703
<i>blood was...</i>

53:25.703 --> 53:27.580
There's something
you should know, Rand.

53:27.580 --> 53:30.249
<i>...and blood
shall ever be."</i>

53:32.793 --> 53:34.462
I'm a monster, too.

53:44.805 --> 53:46.057
What do you mean?

53:55.274 --> 53:57.276
What's happening?

53:59.070 --> 54:01.280
What's happening?

54:16.379 --> 54:18.756
Now, hurry,
we don't have much time.

54:18.756 --> 54:20.841
You killed her.

54:27.390 --> 54:31.435
- You killed her.
- I haven't. I couldn't.

54:31.435 --> 54:33.145
Because that is Lanfear,

54:33.145 --> 54:35.106
Daughter of the Night,

54:35.106 --> 54:37.274
the most dangerous
of the Forsaken.

54:37.274 --> 54:39.777
Her name is Selene.

54:39.777 --> 54:41.237
She owns an inn in the Foregate.

54:41.237 --> 54:42.863
She's been lying to you.

54:42.863 --> 54:45.574
Which I never can.

54:51.205 --> 54:52.957
Now we need to run.

54:54.041 --> 54:55.626
Hurry!

54:58.587 --> 55:00.798
Hurry!
