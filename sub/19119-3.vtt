WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:04.138
Previously on Outsiders...

00:04.172 --> 00:07.241
-Was a white boy
in here with you?

00:07.275 --> 00:08.676
-I have cancer.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.744
There just hasn't been
a good time to tell you.

00:10.778 --> 00:11.545
-You know...

00:13.814 --> 00:16.284
I am Morgan,
and we are the Kenna.

00:16.317 --> 00:17.718
-We were told
that your man had passed.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.153
-You have no right
to ransack it.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.221
-We will find somewhere else.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.356
-Better make it a home
than let it fall to ruin.

00:22.390 --> 00:23.424
-We blocked access to the town.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.593
-Each man is going to survey
a stretch of woods.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.595
-The roads we can't close,
we post guards.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.430
So no more Farrells
coming down here

00:29.463 --> 00:30.631
disturbing the peace...

00:30.664 --> 00:32.433
-Shit!

00:32.466 --> 00:34.335
-(groans and grunts)

00:34.368 --> 00:36.304
-I'm just lookin' for somebody.
I'm lookin' for my Fa.

00:36.337 --> 00:37.505
-Well, if he was dead,
the coroner

00:37.538 --> 00:38.439
would've taken
his body to the morgue.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.374
I'm headed that way
if you want a ride.

00:40.408 --> 00:41.409
-Give me two minutes.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.411
-You know you got
a wild animal in your truck?

00:43.444 --> 00:46.147
(crowd shouting,
groans and grunts)

00:46.180 --> 00:47.548
-Drop that!
Drop the knife right now!

00:47.581 --> 00:48.482
Put your hands behind your head.

00:48.516 --> 00:49.550
MAN: Tell us what you did
with the gun.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.484
-What gun?

00:50.518 --> 00:52.086
-The one you used
to kill Breece Dobbs.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.254
-I didn't kill nobody.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.388
-Bail is denied.

00:54.422 --> 00:55.256
(gavel strikes bench)

00:55.289 --> 00:57.258
-Found you
in the middle of the road.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.427
-I've got big plans for you.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.428
Stitch him up.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.577
-He asked for a circle.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.246
-Yeah, and he don't deserve one.

01:18.279 --> 01:19.413
-Not for you to say!

01:19.447 --> 01:20.414
-No, it's for me.

01:20.448 --> 01:21.382
Get him up.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.760
Get him cleaned up
and get him to a bed.

01:32.793 --> 01:35.196
He'll get his circle
first light.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.197
Take him to Li'l Foster's.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.833
He's not to leave the house
and be eyes on it.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.369
-Okay.

01:41.402 --> 01:42.670
-Take me to my own bed.

01:42.703 --> 01:43.671
-We are.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.573
What's he want a circle for?

01:45.606 --> 01:46.807
-(whispers) I reckon
to stake his claim

01:46.840 --> 01:47.808
to bein' Bren'in.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.177
-She ain't gonna
let that happen,

01:49.210 --> 01:50.744
not after everything he's done.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.481
-Look, we may be bound by law.

01:53.514 --> 01:56.150
She only took the oath
on account of he was dead.

01:56.184 --> 01:58.186
-G'Winn is my Bren'in.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.920
If he tries to harm
one hair on her head,

01:59.953 --> 02:02.323
I'm gonna cut him down myself.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.628
-You sure this is a good idea?

02:07.661 --> 02:09.763
-He has the right to a circle.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.565
What come out, come out.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.870
(insects chirping)

02:22.643 --> 02:24.245
-What the hell?

02:24.278 --> 02:26.314
They call themselves the Kenna.

02:26.347 --> 02:29.817
Said they came up
from shadowside a day ago.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.719
-Why'd they burn my things?

02:33.354 --> 02:35.623
-Here.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.829
-Hey, you do this?

02:41.862 --> 02:42.896
Huh?

02:42.930 --> 02:44.298
Answer me. Hey, hey, hey!

02:44.332 --> 02:45.766
Hey, hey.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.435
What the hell
is wrong with you?

02:47.468 --> 02:49.370
-Foster Farrell.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.938
All apologies, sir.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.640
We were told
thou had perished.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.309
-Oh, so you take my house?

02:55.343 --> 02:57.745
And you torch my belongings.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.813
-The burnin' was meant
as a purification,

02:59.847 --> 03:02.350
a blessing in your memory, sir.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.752
Well, get outta here,
and I don't care who you are.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.789
-I am Morgan.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.294
(indistinct).

03:16.264 --> 03:19.267
And hear me say I am happy
to see you alive.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.404
-Get yourself gone.

03:25.273 --> 03:26.274
-As you wish.

03:36.817 --> 03:40.588
(country blues music)

03:40.621 --> 03:41.489
* The dawn is up *

03:41.522 --> 03:44.558
* There's fire on the mountain *

03:44.592 --> 03:48.629
* They'll have to answer
for their crooked claim *

03:48.662 --> 03:51.999
* The hollows
they'll surround them *

03:52.032 --> 03:54.535
* And they'll go running back *

03:54.568 --> 03:57.605
* To the wretched realm
they came *

04:00.374 --> 04:06.580
* Nor will the dogs of hell
refrain *

04:06.614 --> 04:11.752
* And the land will suffer
those who came *

04:23.397 --> 04:24.665
-Okay. That's enough TV.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.701
Upstairs now.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.036
Wash up and homework,
then bed.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.304
-You heard your dad.
Now go.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.405
-I don't have any homework.

04:31.439 --> 04:34.007
-Hey, and, Hilda, I saw you
kissin' that cat before.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.376
I don't want you
doin' that, okay?

04:35.409 --> 04:36.777
He hasn't had his shots.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.414
(sighs)

04:42.983 --> 04:44.985
That cat pisses me off.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.755
-I think it's doin'
the girls some good.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.458
Gettin' their mind
a little bit off...

04:50.491 --> 04:51.992
everything that's happened.

04:53.627 --> 04:54.628
-When you gonna tell them?

04:54.662 --> 04:56.096
-When the time is right.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.831
WADE: Yeah?
When's that gonna be?

04:57.865 --> 04:59.066
-I don't know.
-I know this is hard,

04:59.099 --> 05:00.401
but you can't just
walk around pretendin'

05:00.434 --> 05:01.502
like it's not happenin'.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.503
You have to face it.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.372
-I know what's happening.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.172
-Yeah? What's that?

05:05.205 --> 05:07.441
-This cancer,
it's a message...

05:07.475 --> 05:11.345
from God, and he's showin' me
the path that I have to travel.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.681
-Well, what-what path is that?

05:13.714 --> 05:15.649
-That I have to be of use

05:15.683 --> 05:17.685
with what precious time
that I've got left.

05:19.052 --> 05:23.557
-Well, I mean...

05:23.591 --> 05:25.459
regardless of whatever,
you know,

05:25.493 --> 05:27.595
celestial message
you're receivin',

05:27.628 --> 05:29.029
there's still practicalities
to take care of.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.030
There's treatment.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.565
There's gonna be the childcare
while you're...

05:31.599 --> 05:33.066
-And that's gonna be expensive.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.602
-Yeah, I know it is.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.470
I'll take care of it.

05:36.504 --> 05:37.705
-Hmmpf.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.573
-I will take care of it.

05:39.607 --> 05:42.376
(bars rattling)

05:42.410 --> 05:43.744
-They ain't gonna move.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.946
(continues rattling)

05:45.979 --> 05:47.681
Stubborn one, eh?

05:47.715 --> 05:51.351
Well, boy, you'll learn.

05:54.488 --> 05:57.458
Hey, you're gonna
hurt yourself.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.992
Medical ain't no better.

06:06.734 --> 06:07.901
(banging)

06:07.935 --> 06:10.404
-What's wrong with you?

06:14.842 --> 06:17.110
(indistinct chatter)

06:25.085 --> 06:27.988
(subdued chatter)

06:50.744 --> 06:52.145
-I killed my mother.

06:52.179 --> 06:55.816
(surprised murmurs)

06:55.849 --> 06:59.620
I killed Lady Ray.

06:59.653 --> 07:04.091
I took the oak
in a manner impure.

07:06.126 --> 07:09.096
And the punishment for this,

07:09.129 --> 07:14.902
for all that I've done,
be banishment.

07:14.935 --> 07:18.005
(all in agreement)

07:19.573 --> 07:23.210
You are the rightful Bren'in.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.679
(assorted agreement)

07:25.713 --> 07:30.651
My fate is in your hands
and the elders.

07:30.684 --> 07:37.858
So whatever comes...
give mercy or no...

07:37.891 --> 07:39.059
I will accept.

07:42.630 --> 07:45.098
(indistinct whispers)

07:49.670 --> 07:52.973
-The proper punishment
is accepted.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.575
If the Bren'in agrees,

07:54.608 --> 07:58.011
you, Foster Farrell VI,
are banished.

07:58.045 --> 08:00.714
-(in unison) Yeah!

08:02.550 --> 08:03.917
-Bren'in, what say you?

08:11.158 --> 08:12.693
-The Bren'in will think on it

08:12.726 --> 08:14.528
and render a decision
at a later time.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.529
-Well, wait a minute. Wait!

08:15.563 --> 08:19.066
After all he's done...
not just to Lady Ray,

08:19.099 --> 08:21.234
but to me, to you,
to all of us...

08:21.268 --> 08:22.903
-That is my word!

08:25.673 --> 08:27.941
The circle is complete.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.176
Thank you all.

08:29.209 --> 08:32.212
(dramatic music)

08:40.821 --> 08:43.123
-All right, take your time,
take your time.

08:43.156 --> 08:45.793
There you go.

08:45.826 --> 08:46.760
-Hey!

08:48.028 --> 08:51.198
-Hasil.
-No, don't speak.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.000
You know, one of the happiest
days of my life

08:53.033 --> 08:56.236
was the day that I heard
you were shot dead.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.572
The only thing
that made me sad

08:58.606 --> 09:00.340
was that I didn't
get to bury you.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.143
-Well, maybe you'll get
your wish... soon enough.

09:03.176 --> 09:06.246
-No, you see,
that's not our way.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.583
-Oh, it's what I deserve.

09:09.617 --> 09:12.185
Maybe Asa'll come around
and finish the job.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.021
-Asa?

09:14.054 --> 09:17.024
Asa's dead, Foster.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.292
And yet, here you stand.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.762
Funny how things turned out.

09:23.631 --> 09:26.700
You know, the only thing
that gives me hope in this life

09:29.136 --> 09:31.605
is that I'm never gonna
have to see you again.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.813
-He's right.

09:39.847 --> 09:40.881
Asa's gone.

09:40.914 --> 09:44.117
That boy got himself
mauled up bad by somethin'.

09:44.151 --> 09:48.088
Hasil, Barnabas,
they found him in pieces.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.760
-Where?

09:52.793 --> 09:56.029
(birds chirping)

10:12.179 --> 10:14.214
-(sighs) I truly...

10:15.983 --> 10:20.854
truly wanted to say my sorries
for what I done to you.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.803
-He tried to kill you, Foster.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.171
-Let that lossie rot.

10:42.075 --> 10:49.316
-You be careful
what you say about my boy.

10:49.349 --> 10:52.953
(heavy breathing)

10:52.986 --> 10:56.089
(soft gentle music)

11:05.165 --> 11:06.934
-Bren'in.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.703
-Kenna.
-I wish to apologize.

11:09.737 --> 11:10.537
-For what?

11:10.570 --> 11:12.072
-For any trouble
I might have caused

11:12.105 --> 11:13.306
by taking that house.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.843
-I told you to take it.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.778
Speak your mind.

11:17.811 --> 11:20.948
-It's not another mouth
you need, I reckon, but an ear.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.415
-He surprised me.

11:22.449 --> 11:25.853
I mean, bein' alive, and also
admitting to what he'd done.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.721
I wasn't prepared for that.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.289
-So, it's true?
G'WINVEER: Oh, yes, it's true.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.891
He killed his mother.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.095
Did other things besides.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.397
-He's the one that hurt you.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.999
-He hurt us all.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.267
-And by his confession,

11:40.300 --> 11:43.871
you think he's changed.
-No.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.439
The trouble is, there are some
who are sympathetic to him.

11:46.473 --> 11:49.109
And by confessin', he makes me
look like the monster

11:49.142 --> 11:50.443
if I punish him.

11:50.477 --> 11:53.080
-There are also those
sympathetic to you,

11:53.113 --> 11:55.983
stinging still from the damage
he done, I imagine.

11:56.016 --> 11:58.852
They won't want you
to go softer, I'm certain.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.789
And bein' a woman leadin' men,
I'm afraid that you will.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.891
-Well, you never saw
our Lady Ray.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.863
So, you say banishment?

12:09.897 --> 12:12.199
-Banishment,
man can come back from.

12:12.232 --> 12:15.035
There's only thing
sure as sure can be...

12:20.407 --> 12:22.275
-Farrells don't kill Farrells.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.077
KENNA:
Then I don't envy ye, Bren'in.

12:25.478 --> 12:28.248
The needle,
you have to thread it.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.860
-Still can't believe
you crashed it.

12:39.893 --> 12:42.029
-Big metal doohies
came up out of nowheres.

12:44.832 --> 12:47.200
Anyways, we got
bigger problems now.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.203
-Yeah? Like what?

12:50.237 --> 12:52.405
-Big Foster.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.942
Think G'Winn's
gonna let him stay?

12:54.975 --> 12:56.176
-Don't know.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.998
WOMAN: Well, we can do your
intake today if you'd like.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.867
-Today?
WOMAN: If you can get here.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.534
We're a few hours
from Blackburg.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.072
-Yeah. No, I can.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.240
Um, just put me down.
I'll be there.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.242
WOMAN:
Okay. We'll see you at 3.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.310
-Thank you.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.311
Bye.

13:36.649 --> 13:40.087
-Hey, um, Yolanda's mother's car
is in the shop,

13:40.120 --> 13:42.355
and, uh, she's been
takin' the bus.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.424
So can I use yours?

13:46.526 --> 13:48.161
-Just to get to work?

13:48.195 --> 13:49.129
-Yeah.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.264
-It ain't but 15 minutes
from the Mini Mart.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.633
I expect you walkin'
back through that door at 5:15.

13:53.666 --> 13:54.834
-Yeah, okay.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.171
-Hey...

13:58.205 --> 14:00.207
I just worry about you,
that's all.

14:00.240 --> 14:04.044
You earn trust
and you get trust.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.147
-I know I'm required to.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.148
It's on its way.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.150
What else do you want me to...

14:10.183 --> 14:12.652
Of course, I want to.
He's my son also.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.922
I get there as often
as I can, Stewart.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.289
I'm here doing a job.

14:16.323 --> 14:17.590
It's a good thing
one of us has one.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.359
Otherwise there'd be
nothing for him at all!

14:19.392 --> 14:20.527
Good-bye.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.631
Wade, come on in.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.936
What can I do for you?

14:28.969 --> 14:31.638
-Well, I have a-- a problem.

14:31.671 --> 14:34.107
I was just hopin' to clarify
somethin' with you.

14:34.141 --> 14:35.642
-Okay. You know what,
I think we should each

14:35.675 --> 14:38.311
just feel free to go ahead
and remain in the roles

14:38.345 --> 14:40.247
that Mr. Meyers
has laid out for us.

14:40.280 --> 14:44.251
-No. I mean, I ain't thrilled
about that, but, uh, I was...

14:44.284 --> 14:46.619
I was lookin' at how
you provide healthcare

14:46.653 --> 14:48.621
for employees and spouses.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.257
It seems that generally
that's the case,

14:50.290 --> 14:53.226
but, uh, Breece Dobbs,
seems he wasn't covered.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.995
-I don't understand.

14:55.028 --> 14:58.165
-Oh. Ledda's... she's sick.

14:58.198 --> 15:01.368
It's my sister,
and she was Breece's wife.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.136
-Oh, God! Of course.

15:03.170 --> 15:04.437
Here, come sit down.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.039
Is it serious?

15:06.073 --> 15:11.478
-Um, uh, yeah,
it's pancreatic cancer.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.313
-Wade, I'm so sorry.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.614
-How sorry?

15:14.647 --> 15:16.683
HAYLIE: I don't control
who gets healthcare.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.385
That kicks in after
a certain number of months,

15:18.418 --> 15:20.220
and Breece wasn't here
long enough.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.654
-They got two kids.

15:25.025 --> 15:25.993
Really?

15:26.026 --> 15:27.961
Are-are you serious?

15:27.995 --> 15:29.529
Are you just goin' back to work?

15:29.562 --> 15:32.665
Hello? I mean, uh,
what are you doin'?

15:32.699 --> 15:35.535
You just gonna ignore me?

15:35.568 --> 15:37.537
HAYLIE:
Well, would you look at that.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.207
Looks like I was wrong about
when Breece started here.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.675
Looks like he is eligible
for insurance after all.

15:42.709 --> 15:43.843
-What are you talkin' about?

15:43.876 --> 15:46.146
HAYLIE: I have to point out
this little clerical error

15:46.179 --> 15:48.215
to the benefits department
back in Roanoke,

15:48.248 --> 15:51.218
but then your sister should be
covered in a couple of days.

15:53.420 --> 15:54.988
I think the phrase
you're searching for

15:55.022 --> 15:56.089
is "thank you."

15:57.224 --> 15:59.359
-Uh, yeah.
Thank you.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.527
-Don't mention it.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.530
-Earl!

16:03.563 --> 16:05.265
Earl!

16:05.298 --> 16:06.666
Don't act like
you can't hear me, Earl.

16:06.699 --> 16:07.667
I see ya there.

16:07.700 --> 16:08.768
-What is it, Virgil?

16:08.801 --> 16:11.771
-I told him he was gonna give
before the bars did.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.440
-Oh, shit!

16:13.473 --> 16:16.576
Hey, Ron, got one
for the infirmary here.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.111
-Take him to the infirmary.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.312
I don't think I can
handle this one on my own.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.181
He's a little big.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.449
Rule 12.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.651
-He's not even supposed to be
in the prison.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.620
Ain't convicted yet.
Why ain't he in the county jail?

16:27.654 --> 16:29.022
-Overcrowdin'.

16:29.056 --> 16:31.091
-Hey! Code red! Code red!

16:31.124 --> 16:34.461
(grunting)

16:34.494 --> 16:37.230
(inmates cheer)

16:39.532 --> 16:42.001
(grunting)

16:51.511 --> 16:54.114
(groans and grunts)

17:16.469 --> 17:17.537
(screams)

17:21.308 --> 17:22.475
-If you're headed
where I think you're headed,

17:22.509 --> 17:24.311
we're goin' in there with you.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.379
-No offense,
you're both strong of heart.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.181
But I'm gonna need strong
in other ways.

17:32.419 --> 17:33.386
-What?

17:33.420 --> 17:34.787
-She doin'
with her medicine?

17:42.795 --> 17:44.464
-Where's Li'l Foster?

17:44.497 --> 17:46.133
He ain't come to see me yet.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.569
-I sent him to find your body.

17:49.602 --> 17:52.272
We didn't know it was somehow
still up walkin' around.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.541
FOSTER FARRELL: Well,
lostie took his best shot.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.876
My boys, they say
that he run off

17:56.909 --> 17:59.412
and then got hisself dead.

17:59.446 --> 18:00.480
That true?

18:00.513 --> 18:02.349
-It's true.
-Oh, you sure?

18:02.382 --> 18:04.584
'Cause he was dead
the first time when he shot me.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.586
-I'm sure.
-Uh-hm.

18:12.559 --> 18:13.526
-Show me.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.666
(sighs)

18:19.699 --> 18:20.800
Stitches worse
than the wound.

18:20.833 --> 18:21.734
You do that yourself?

18:21.768 --> 18:23.536
FOSTER FARRELL:
No. They were done to me.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.638
In a house of horrors,

18:25.672 --> 18:28.408
the likes of which
I hope you never see.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.579
You come to heal me?

18:32.612 --> 18:36.283
-I don't want it on my head
you dyin' alone in the woods.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.385
-Hey, leave us.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.188
Go.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.527
-I forgive you
for what you done.

18:47.560 --> 18:48.795
- You forgive me?

18:48.828 --> 18:50.230
FOSTER FARRELL:
Did what you had to.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.665
What you thought
was right for the clan.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.901
And that's how I know

18:54.934 --> 18:57.537
that you are
the rightful Bren'in.

18:57.570 --> 19:00.907
One way, leastways,
'cause my boys also told me

19:00.940 --> 19:05.945
how you faced them lawmen down,
your way.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.715
Better than my way woulda been.

19:08.748 --> 19:12.619
See, bein' Bren'in,
the power of it,

19:12.652 --> 19:17.257
and the-the desire for it,
changes ya.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.792
Changed me.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.828
Changed me for the worse.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.764
Seems like it's changed you
for the better.

19:24.797 --> 19:27.400
Well, somethin's changed in me
for the better, too.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.237
-(scoffs)

19:30.270 --> 19:31.204
-Oh, that funny?

19:33.840 --> 19:35.942
-You weren't gone but a week.

19:35.975 --> 19:36.809
That's not even enough time

19:36.843 --> 19:38.578
for a caterpillar
to make a cocoon,

19:38.611 --> 19:40.513
let alone come back out
a butterfly.

19:40.547 --> 19:43.483
-This change was growin' in me.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.684
Long before I went away.

19:44.717 --> 19:48.221
Can we talk?
In private?

19:50.457 --> 19:51.658
-Stay just outside.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.767
-I love you, G'Winveer.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.735
I long have.

20:02.769 --> 20:07.374
And I know that I ain't worthy
of you yet, I know that.

20:09.509 --> 20:13.946
But I hope that by admittin'
what I done

20:13.980 --> 20:19.486
and takin' what comes,
I can begin to be.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.555
-You'd say anythin'
to get what you want.

20:22.589 --> 20:23.690
That's what I know.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.225
-Then I won't show you
by what I say.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.397
I will show you by what I do.

20:38.305 --> 20:39.339
-Get it on tight.

20:52.552 --> 20:55.622
-Gather every gun we got.

20:55.655 --> 20:56.989
Bring 'em all to me.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.541
-How far does it go?

21:14.574 --> 21:18.745
-Well, that way, it goes
clear to Crow Rock.

21:18.778 --> 21:19.946
That way, don't know.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.614
Came to find you.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.716
(clangs chain fence)

21:23.750 --> 21:26.986
It could be a problem next time
we need to go on a run.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.588
-Won't be doin' no more runs.

21:28.621 --> 21:29.922
We're relyin' too much
on down there.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.758
We need to get back
to the old ways.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.527
-You know, it could cut us off
from our own lands, too.

21:34.561 --> 21:37.564
Good fishin' down at the falls,
deer in the old woods.

21:39.899 --> 21:42.635
-Okay. Walk the edge.
See how far it goes.

21:42.669 --> 21:45.672
But, Hasil, don't be
startin' any trouble.

21:45.705 --> 21:47.674
Stay on our side for now.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.709
-The law of the mountain
says all this is ours.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.644
We're strayin' from that
completely.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.880
-You got somethin' to say,
cousin, say it plain.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.116
-That man,
he almost killed us all,

21:57.149 --> 21:58.751
and now you think
about lettin' him back in.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.720
If you think I'm the only one
that's got a problem

22:00.753 --> 22:02.889
with that, Bren'in,
then you foolin' yourself.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.924
-I hear you.

22:04.957 --> 22:07.059
I'm just threadin'
the needle is all.

22:07.093 --> 22:09.095
I need you to trust me.

22:09.128 --> 22:11.398
Find out all you can
about this here fence.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.968
-What happens if it goes
all the way around?

22:16.002 --> 22:18.671
-We ain't trapped up here.
They trapped down there.

22:20.773 --> 22:23.075
WOMAN: Like I said,
without an oncologist exam,

22:23.109 --> 22:25.044
all I can give you
is the ballpark figure.

22:25.077 --> 22:26.012
-Yeah, that's fine.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.720
-And she does have insurance.

22:33.753 --> 22:37.724
-Yeah. Uh, uh, we don't have
all the paperwork,

22:37.757 --> 22:39.759
but, uh, yeah, she does.

22:39.792 --> 22:40.993
WOMAN:
That's good of you,

22:41.027 --> 22:43.763
to take some of
the pressure off her.

22:43.796 --> 22:45.665
-Yeah, well, family.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.166
WOMAN:
You'd be surprised.

22:47.199 --> 22:47.967
Okay.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.802
So it looks like,
with everything,

22:49.836 --> 22:54.841
she'd be looking at
about $135,000 all in.

22:54.874 --> 22:58.611
-Okay. And, uh, and the co-pay?

22:58.645 --> 23:00.747
I mean, uh, minus the insurance.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.081
-No, no, no. I know...

23:02.114 --> 23:05.685
Just $135,000 is the co-pay.

23:07.219 --> 23:10.189
-What the... how's anybody
supposed to pay that?

23:10.222 --> 23:12.759
I mean, that's a death sentence.
-Sheriff!

23:12.792 --> 23:14.927
-How's it feel to work
for a system like that?

23:14.961 --> 23:17.697
Work for a system
that kills people?

23:17.730 --> 23:19.065
Might not be pullin'
the trigger yourself,

23:19.098 --> 23:20.900
you might as well be.

23:25.004 --> 23:27.073
Sorry.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.708
You're just doin' your job.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.545
(sighs)

23:33.813 --> 23:36.749
(suspenseful music)

23:48.127 --> 23:49.629
-Emelye, I come to you...

23:49.662 --> 23:51.964
-You said you're sorry
in the circle, Foster.

23:51.998 --> 23:52.865
Bren'in is strong.

23:52.899 --> 23:53.966
She will make her decision
on her own.

23:54.000 --> 23:58.605
-Oh, she's gonna banish me.
It's her only choice.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.172
-What is it you want then?

24:00.206 --> 24:01.908
-My mother.

24:01.941 --> 24:08.548
She used to tell me stories,
dark tales to scare me.

24:08.581 --> 24:09.816
-And?

24:09.849 --> 24:14.954
-Stories about this...
this mountain...

24:14.987 --> 24:19.826
and that the-the natives here,
the Cherokee,

24:19.859 --> 24:21.127
they called it Blood.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.195
-The ga-ha-gedane.

24:23.229 --> 24:25.698
Blood Mountain,
they named it, yes.

24:25.732 --> 24:28.801
-Well,
these scary tales she told,

24:28.835 --> 24:30.870
they were of a clan,

24:30.903 --> 24:36.275
a cult of thieves,
evildoers, of witches.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.712
She said they were called
the Kenna.

24:39.746 --> 24:42.649
-Yes, I heard those stories
as a girl myself.

24:44.150 --> 24:47.153
Fairy tales, I believe
they are called, Foster.

24:47.186 --> 24:51.057
-And so, these Kenna,
you don't fear them?

24:51.090 --> 24:52.725
-Would you if they were men?

24:55.127 --> 24:56.696
You fear all women, don't you?

24:56.729 --> 25:01.300
-No, I fear...
for our clan, is all.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.270
Now I felt that I should
speak my mind to you.

25:04.303 --> 25:07.306
'Cause in the past, I
disrespected you and the elders,

25:07.339 --> 25:12.244
and if I am allowed to stay,
that will change.

25:24.323 --> 25:27.259
-(whispers indistinctly)

26:00.860 --> 26:02.629
So, Sally-Ann, you are here

26:02.662 --> 26:06.098
because you're thinking about
terminating your pregnancy?

26:06.132 --> 26:08.901
-I-I don't know. Maybe.

26:08.935 --> 26:11.370
I mean, I just-- I just wanted
to know it works, I guess.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.806
-All right. Do you know about
how far along you are?

26:13.840 --> 26:14.907
-Less than two months.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.743
-Okay.
Well, we'll do a physical,

26:16.776 --> 26:18.711
and if you're
in your first trimester,

26:18.745 --> 26:20.246
a chemical abortion
is an option,

26:20.279 --> 26:22.048
-and that's a pill.
-Oh.

26:22.081 --> 26:25.184
Now state law requires that
I give you some information,

26:25.217 --> 26:28.721
and it's about alternatives
like adoption.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.823
-No, no, no. Nobody can help.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.625
-You know what, I get it.
I understand,

26:32.659 --> 26:35.895
although state law requires
that I have to give this to you,

26:35.928 --> 26:37.797
and then we have
a 24-hour waiting period

26:37.830 --> 26:39.966
before we can proceed.

26:39.999 --> 26:42.101
-I can't come back tomorrow.
-That's all right.

26:42.134 --> 26:44.370
Just come back when you can,
and in the meanwhile,

26:44.403 --> 26:45.905
let's go do a physical

26:45.938 --> 26:48.007
and take another pregnancy test,
just to be sure.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.141
-How much is the pill?

26:49.175 --> 26:51.077
-It's $800.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.845
-Is there another way?

26:52.879 --> 26:55.414
-There is, Sally-Ann,
but that's $2,000 or $3,000

26:55.447 --> 26:57.016
and we wouldn't be able
to get you in

26:57.049 --> 26:58.417
for another couple months.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.052
We're the only clinic
for 200 miles.

27:00.086 --> 27:01.754
Everyone else
has been shut down.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.222
-Is there another place
that I can go?

27:03.255 --> 27:05.892
-Can you get yourself
to St. Louis or Ohio?

27:05.925 --> 27:08.027
You might be able to find
more affordable options.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.161
-I can't!

27:09.195 --> 27:10.763
(phone vibrates)

27:17.236 --> 27:18.137
(sighs)

27:20.439 --> 27:22.141
-I-I ain't been too good
with the upkeep of the place,

27:22.174 --> 27:26.979
but, uh, it's a good house
and, um,

27:27.013 --> 27:33.419
it gets, um, pretty good light,
uh, some mornings.

27:33.452 --> 27:37.356
I can, uh, throw the furniture
in if you think that'll help.

27:37.389 --> 27:40.827
-No, I think unfurnished
is the way to go here.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.695
I mean, if you're looking
to drive up the price,

27:42.729 --> 27:45.131
you could repaint
or re-do the kitchen,

27:45.164 --> 27:47.700
the bathroom,
the other rooms.

27:47.734 --> 27:49.068
-Really?
'Cause I mean, you know,

27:49.101 --> 27:51.437
Auntie Ray picked out
a lot of this stuff.

27:51.470 --> 27:57.844
I mean, uh, uh, the cabinets
and the tile.

27:57.877 --> 28:00.212
I mean, she had
a pretty good eye.

28:00.246 --> 28:01.914
(sighs)

28:01.948 --> 28:03.449
But, you know,
you're the expert.

28:03.482 --> 28:05.084
Whatever you think will help.

28:05.117 --> 28:09.088
-(sighs) You know what,
it's probably fine.

28:09.121 --> 28:10.723
That would just be
puttin' money out

28:10.757 --> 28:13.459
in the hopes of gettin'
more back, and, well...

28:15.995 --> 28:18.430
-What do you think
I'm gonna get for it?

28:18.464 --> 28:21.934
-$15,000, maybe $18,000.

28:21.968 --> 28:24.303
Ordinarily
I wouldn't even do this.

28:24.336 --> 28:26.238
No commission.

28:26.272 --> 28:28.207
I'm here as a personal favor
to you, Sheriff.

28:32.278 --> 28:35.381
-Well, thank you.
Whatever we can get.

28:35.414 --> 28:36.916
-All right.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.124
-All right. Is that all?

28:45.157 --> 28:47.126
-We got one more load.

28:47.159 --> 28:48.795
-All right. Well, go.
-Come on.

28:59.972 --> 29:01.808
-Uh-oh, sorry.

29:01.841 --> 29:02.909
Still alive.

29:02.942 --> 29:05.377
-The house is yours,
once and future.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.279
I come on other matters.

29:07.313 --> 29:08.147
-Speak.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.516
-Me and mine got here
not days ago.

29:10.549 --> 29:12.318
We're new to your clan.

29:12.351 --> 29:15.454
Sometimes it's the freshest eye
that can see the most clear.

29:15.487 --> 29:17.256
-Hmmpf. What do you see?

29:17.289 --> 29:19.258
-That G'Winn.
She's a young one.

29:19.291 --> 29:22.194
-In years, maybe.
Old in spirit.

29:22.228 --> 29:25.564
-I've seen the looks
on some faces when she speaks,

29:25.597 --> 29:29.001
and on those same faces
when you come back.

29:29.035 --> 29:31.103
There are some don't think
she's up to leadin'.

29:31.137 --> 29:32.271
Think you are.

29:32.304 --> 29:35.041
-Well, G'Winn is stronger
than she looks.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.408
You can take my word on that.

29:36.442 --> 29:37.376
-Strong as you?

29:40.112 --> 29:41.413
-Who are you?

29:41.447 --> 29:43.983
-Just one who's joined
my people to yours

29:44.016 --> 29:47.319
and worries for the fate of both
in the tryin' times to come.

29:47.353 --> 29:49.388
-So, you're plannin' on
bein' here a while then.

29:49.421 --> 29:50.823
-We have no other place to go.

29:50.857 --> 29:53.926
-Well, you are meddlin'
awfully high,

29:53.960 --> 29:58.530
awfully soon, for someone
with no place else to go.

29:58.564 --> 29:59.465
You're right.

29:59.498 --> 30:02.601
You and yours,
you got here not days ago.

30:02.634 --> 30:05.371
You're new to our clan,

30:05.404 --> 30:08.574
but sometimes the freshest eyes,
they don't see shit.

30:13.946 --> 30:20.252
-You love her, and that love
is at war with another feelin'.

30:20.286 --> 30:21.320
Which is the stronger?

30:24.256 --> 30:25.457
I wonder.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.136
-(beeping)
-MAN: That's good right there.

30:38.204 --> 30:40.472
(man speaking indistinctly)

30:48.647 --> 30:51.583
(drill equipment running)

30:57.623 --> 30:59.058
(car door bangs shut)

31:03.595 --> 31:05.564
-Millie.
-How's it goin', Sheriff?

31:05.597 --> 31:07.299
-Same shit, different day.

31:07.333 --> 31:08.334
-Hmm.

31:08.367 --> 31:11.337
-Just, um...

31:11.370 --> 31:12.972
just these.

31:13.005 --> 31:14.306
What do I owe you for that?

31:14.340 --> 31:16.442
-Uh, $32.65.

31:16.475 --> 31:19.478
-$32...$32.65?

31:19.511 --> 31:22.014
It's just a little bottle,
not even the real one.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.415
-No, that's your total,

31:23.449 --> 31:25.317
for the ibuprofen
and your prescription.

31:25.351 --> 31:26.252
-What's the prescription?

31:26.285 --> 31:29.155
-Your OxyContin.
The hospital called it in.

31:29.188 --> 31:30.990
-Oh. Yeah.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.458
-I've been waitin'
for you to come in.

31:32.491 --> 31:33.926
Assume that's what you're after.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.294
-No.

31:35.327 --> 31:37.096
-Oh. Okay, then. I'll...
-But, uh...

31:37.129 --> 31:39.298
Yeah. I'll...
Yeah, I'll take it.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.400
-You sure?
-Yeah. $32.65?

31:41.433 --> 31:42.368
-Yes, sir.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.337
Thank you, sir.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.676
(whispering indistinctly)

31:59.318 --> 32:01.087
-(whispers) Sit tight, Farrell.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.455
We're gonna have plenty of time
to break you.

32:03.489 --> 32:05.557
(snicker)

32:05.591 --> 32:08.560
(suspenseful theme)

32:27.146 --> 32:30.082
(alarms wailing)

32:31.783 --> 32:33.319
-Come on guys,
let's get them Farrells.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.724
-Stay back.
I don't wanna shoot ya!

33:04.550 --> 33:05.484
-Get on!

33:17.263 --> 33:19.265
-Are you sure
you wanna do this?

33:19.298 --> 33:20.332
-It's the only way.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.372
-Let's go.

33:41.087 --> 33:42.488
MORGAN:
He said all the right things.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.256
Aloud.

33:44.290 --> 33:45.457
What insight?

33:45.491 --> 33:48.494
-Darkness...
like I thought.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.729
-Could be he's tryin'
to change for true.

33:53.832 --> 33:56.802
Or it could be he's waitin'
'til he's not so frail

33:56.835 --> 33:58.070
to show his colors.

34:03.742 --> 34:06.212
-Bren'in.
-Foster.

34:37.609 --> 34:38.677
-Leave me.

34:54.460 --> 34:57.463
WADE: It's gonna be steep
even with the insurance.

34:57.496 --> 34:58.630
I'm gonna sell the house.

34:58.664 --> 35:01.300
If I do a bit of work on it,
it'll drive up the value,

35:01.333 --> 35:02.568
and, uh, you know,

35:02.601 --> 35:03.835
we can pay the whole thing off
in installments,

35:03.869 --> 35:05.437
cut a few expenses,

35:05.471 --> 35:08.240
and, uh, I'm more than willin'
to take on a night job.

35:08.274 --> 35:11.243
Maybe I can do somethin'
in security. -Wade, listen.

35:11.277 --> 35:13.145
I'm not gettin' treatment.
-What?

35:13.179 --> 35:15.481
-I appreciate all that
you are tryin' to do.

35:15.514 --> 35:17.416
WADE: I don't care if you
appreciate it or not.

35:17.449 --> 35:18.617
You're gettin' treatment.

35:18.650 --> 35:21.187
-No. I'm not puttin' myself
through it.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.421
Or my kids.

35:22.454 --> 35:25.457
It's months of pain
and humiliation

35:25.491 --> 35:26.892
just so I can die anyway

35:26.925 --> 35:27.893
and leave you all
in the poorhouse.

35:27.926 --> 35:29.661
-Do you have any idea
what the alternative is?

35:29.695 --> 35:31.763
Do you even know
what you're sayin'?

35:31.797 --> 35:33.599
-Sh-h-h-h!

35:33.632 --> 35:35.734
-Do you realize?
-Sh-h-h-h! Sh-h-h-h!

35:35.767 --> 35:38.270
God has a plan for me.

35:38.304 --> 35:40.306
I've seen it,
and he's already showin' me

35:40.339 --> 35:41.707
that I'm doin' the right thing.

35:44.576 --> 35:46.412
(pours coffee)

35:46.445 --> 35:47.413
-What about your kids?

35:47.446 --> 35:49.715
-He's got a plan for them, too.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.486
And for you.

36:15.774 --> 36:18.710
(approaching ATV)

36:24.316 --> 36:26.852
-Whew.

36:26.885 --> 36:29.221
-What's goin' on?
Where you been?

36:29.255 --> 36:31.390
-This one took a tumble
during patrol the other day.

36:31.423 --> 36:32.658
Just went to get it back.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.226
That's all.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.596
-And they won't come?

36:37.629 --> 36:38.764
Look like
they put up a fight.

36:38.797 --> 36:40.732
-It was in the wrong hands.

36:40.766 --> 36:43.469
-Hasil, I asked you not to
start any more trouble.

36:43.502 --> 36:45.571
I told you you needed to stay
on this side of the fence.

36:45.604 --> 36:46.972
-What, more than we need
these wheels?

36:47.005 --> 36:48.740
-Fightin' is what's gonna
bring them back up here.

36:48.774 --> 36:49.775
-Yeah, and I didn't know

36:49.808 --> 36:51.943
I was gonna have to fight
when I went for it.

36:51.977 --> 36:53.945
The fight came to me.

36:53.979 --> 36:56.248
All right. Look, you give me
responsibilities,

36:56.282 --> 36:57.983
and I'll take this serious.

36:58.016 --> 36:58.850
I'm just tryin' to help.

36:58.884 --> 37:02.354
Now you asked me
to trust you, and I do.

37:02.388 --> 37:03.322
So, trust me.

37:34.386 --> 37:35.587
(knock on door)

37:35.621 --> 37:38.424
CALEB:
Dad?

37:38.457 --> 37:39.458
(knock on door)

37:39.491 --> 37:40.726
-Yeah, I'm in here.
CALEB: Dad?

37:42.761 --> 37:44.696
-Yeah, Caleb, I'm in here.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.332
CALEB: Are you okay?

37:50.068 --> 37:53.339
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.
What's the matter?

37:53.372 --> 37:54.139
-Nothin'.

37:54.172 --> 37:57.075
I was just worried
you were sick.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.043
-No, I'm not sick.

38:00.846 --> 38:02.381
I'll be out in a minute.

38:02.414 --> 38:03.682
-Okay.

38:35.881 --> 38:38.817
(flushing)

38:47.493 --> 38:48.660
-(sighs)

39:09.915 --> 39:11.683
-Hey, I'm sorry.
I was at work,

39:11.717 --> 39:13.585
and Mitch said
that we had to do inventory,

39:13.619 --> 39:15.521
and it was like 5:05
and by the time I...

39:15.554 --> 39:16.722
-What's this?

39:16.755 --> 39:18.390
Goddamn pregnancy test.

39:18.424 --> 39:19.224
Get out of the car.

39:19.257 --> 39:20.926
-I was tryin' to
deal with it, okay?

39:20.959 --> 39:22.594
-I thought I told you
to stop seein' him.

39:22.628 --> 39:24.162
-I didn't go see him.
I said I was tryin'...

39:24.195 --> 39:25.931
-Stop lyin' to me! You've been
lyin' the whole goddamn time!

39:25.964 --> 39:27.599
-Would you just listen to me.
-(yelling) Get outta the car.

39:27.633 --> 39:29.468
Come on! Hey!
(Sally-Ann groans)

39:29.501 --> 39:31.069
-Hey, don't you drive this car!

39:31.102 --> 39:32.170
Don't drive my car!
-I'm driving, okay?

39:32.203 --> 39:34.440
-Hey, don't you...
Don't you...

39:36.141 --> 39:38.043
(yelling) You don't
come back then!

39:38.076 --> 39:40.679
You leave like this,
and you don't come back!

40:46.545 --> 40:48.947
-(sobs)

40:54.586 --> 40:57.523
(dramatic theme)

41:10.702 --> 41:13.639
(heavy breathing)

41:37.663 --> 41:39.164
(gasps)

42:15.934 --> 42:17.703
-Li'l Foster back yet?

42:17.736 --> 42:18.670
-Not yet.

42:20.371 --> 42:23.975
-(sighs) It's not like him
to lose a trail.

42:24.009 --> 42:26.177
-If he's not back soonest,
we'll look.

42:26.211 --> 42:29.080
But I'm here about you.
You're right.

42:29.114 --> 42:32.183
Banishment's the proper sentence
for what you've done,

42:32.217 --> 42:34.052
only the mountain
already banished you,

42:34.085 --> 42:36.087
put you through
some kind of hell down there

42:36.121 --> 42:38.156
from what you said,
and then brought you back.

42:41.126 --> 42:43.294
You know,
Lady Ray used to say

42:43.328 --> 42:45.096
when you're most sure
what the mountain wants,

42:45.130 --> 42:46.598
it makes you fools.

42:48.199 --> 42:49.768
-(whispers)
Where'd you get that?

42:49.801 --> 42:50.736
-It come to me.

42:52.337 --> 42:54.172
When they came up here,
we scared 'em off,

42:54.205 --> 42:55.907
but that won't be
the last of it.

42:55.941 --> 42:58.844
Now they're buildin' a fence,
and I don't know for why.

42:58.877 --> 43:02.180
Somethin's comin', Foster,
and I don't trust you.

43:02.213 --> 43:04.983
I don't, but a Bren'in needs
certain tools,

43:05.016 --> 43:09.354
and I may need you
for what's comin'.

43:09.387 --> 43:13.625
-It would be my honor to serve.

43:13.659 --> 43:15.026
-Heal up.
