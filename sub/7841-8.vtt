00:28.323 --> 00:29.856
Can I help you
with that, sir?

00:29.857 --> 00:30.503
Oh, no.

00:30.504 --> 00:33.664
I ain't tippin' some jerk two bucks
to tie a TV to my car.

00:33.665 --> 00:35.614
Mama Moe didn't raise no fools.

00:40.140 --> 00:40.779
Well,

00:40.780 --> 00:42.771
I guess I can just keep
watching DVDs

00:42.772 --> 00:44.786
by following family vans around.

00:47.855 --> 00:49.092
Big Bird in China?

00:49.098 --> 00:50.450
Won't Grover get lonely?

00:50.801 --> 00:51.842
Oh, no, wait.

00:51.841 --> 00:53.534
He's hangin' out
with Derek Jeter.

00:54.512 --> 00:56.153
Now ignore all the fancy

00:56.159 --> 00:57.631
shmancy things thingamajigs, boy.

00:57.637 --> 01:00.081
We're just gonna get a
camera battery and go home.

01:00.086 --> 01:01.271
Are you interested in a car stereo?

01:01.275 --> 01:02.881
No, thanks. Just here
for a battery.

01:02.887 --> 01:04.681
Big special on camcorders!

01:04.685 --> 01:05.882
All I want is a battery.

01:05.886 --> 01:07.213
Care to make love, sir?

01:07.215 --> 01:08.581
Battery, battery, battery!

01:09.647 --> 01:11.011
Hmm...

01:11.687 --> 01:12.770
No!

01:13.226 --> 01:14.372
Bingo!

01:14.826 --> 01:16.413
One battery, please.

01:16.418 --> 01:17.553
That'll be 50 cents,

01:17.555 --> 01:20.573
or free with the purchase
of a $200 TiVO

01:20.578 --> 01:21.930
plus a two-year contract.

01:21.935 --> 01:22.660
Sold!

01:23.426 --> 01:24.123
Sucker.

01:28.538 --> 01:29.991
Sir, your TiVO?

01:29.996 --> 01:30.723
My what now?

01:31.886 --> 01:33.462
Oh, no.

01:33.566 --> 01:34.522
Oh!

01:34.526 --> 01:36.173
Come on, Lisa!

01:36.178 --> 01:38.971
The TV's been off
for five whole minutes!

01:40.055 --> 01:42.211
The TiVO is installed!

01:42.217 --> 01:44.833
Now we catch shows
and skip the commercials!

02:08.527 --> 02:10.103
Will Itchy win again,

02:10.107 --> 02:11.672
or will something else happen?

02:11.676 --> 02:14.171
We'll find out right after
these ten commercials.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.862
Oh, no, we won't.

02:17.298 --> 02:19.292
Whoa!

02:20.798 --> 02:22.542
I spit on your corpse, advertisers

02:22.548 --> 02:24.292
supporting television.

02:25.475 --> 02:26.223
Yeah!

02:27.218 --> 02:30.290
And now for the
exciting conclusion!

02:33.815 --> 02:36.112
Oh, the hilarity!

02:37.655 --> 02:38.520
Mmm.

02:42.036 --> 02:43.672
Without the commercial interruption,

02:43.677 --> 02:46.322
I could really follow the story.

02:46.327 --> 02:49.790
TiVo, you've got a season
pass to my heart.

02:53.138 --> 02:54.882
Ooh, Opal!

02:57.645 --> 03:00.790
Sounds like you've given
us some words to eat by.

03:00.795 --> 03:03.772
Doctor Chef will be back
after these messages!

03:05.018 --> 03:07.093
Here's a message for you.

03:09.486 --> 03:10.471
Welcome back.

03:10.477 --> 03:12.252
I have some big, big news.

03:12.255 --> 03:15.100
My boyfriend Straightman
just proposed...

03:16.176 --> 03:19.463
...that we go on separate
vacations again this year!

03:20.646 --> 03:23.262
Hmm. I think I'll speed
through the cheering.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.632
Oh, TiVO remote

03:31.637 --> 03:33.781
you've changed my life.

03:33.787 --> 03:35.642
I've gotten so much accomplished.

03:35.645 --> 03:37.020
I saved Lost,

03:37.028 --> 03:38.600
watched all Rome in a day,

03:38.616 --> 03:40.543
and got Two and a half men in

03:40.547 --> 03:41.793
two and a half minutes.

03:41.795 --> 03:43.892
Then I ran out of space

03:43.895 --> 03:46.440
and had to choose
between Sophie's Choice

03:46.448 --> 03:47.872
and Schindler's list.

03:47.877 --> 03:51.242
Why is everything Hollywood
make so excellent?

03:51.248 --> 03:52.430
Why?

03:54.506 --> 03:56.982
Marge Simpson!

03:56.995 --> 03:57.640
Oh!

03:57.646 --> 03:59.523
Keith Olbermann?!

03:59.528 --> 04:00.300
That's right,

04:00.307 --> 04:02.753
content burglar Marge Simpson.

04:02.758 --> 04:04.203
You've been watching TV shows,

04:04.208 --> 04:06.280
but skipping the commercials
that pay for them.

04:06.288 --> 04:07.352
That makes you...

04:07.356 --> 04:10.330
the worst person in the world!

04:13.347 --> 04:14.913
Oh, lighten up.

04:14.918 --> 04:17.250
You TV fat cats have plenty of money.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.313
My cousin Marine saw you
flying in business class!

04:20.317 --> 04:22.520
I was upgraded against my will!

04:22.878 --> 04:25.362
Look Marge, you think
I'm handsome don't you?

04:25.365 --> 04:26.201
Of course.

04:26.216 --> 04:29.162
It takes a team of 20 people
to keep me that way,

04:29.166 --> 04:30.241
without ad money,

04:30.246 --> 04:32.923
I'd look like a swamp monster
from a child's nightmare!

04:33.795 --> 04:35.632
And under here,
I look even worse.

04:36.055 --> 04:37.420
Then it gets better,

04:37.955 --> 04:40.381
then even worse!

04:40.386 --> 04:41.271
Oh stop it!

04:41.278 --> 04:43.812
Oh stop it!
I'll watch the commercials!

04:47.445 --> 04:50.183
That's why this is the only
mop endorsed by me,

04:50.186 --> 04:52.850
former NFL draft pick, Ryan Leaf.

04:53.245 --> 04:54.781
Mom, what are you doing?

04:54.788 --> 04:56.950
I'm honoring America's advertisers.

04:56.958 --> 04:59.691
Then we're going to buy some
toothpaste, lease a new car,

04:59.697 --> 05:01.902
vote "yes" on prop 87.

05:01.906 --> 05:03.012
No! No!

05:03.026 --> 05:06.031
Prop 87 lets big polluters off the hook!

05:06.036 --> 05:07.420
Impossible.

05:07.436 --> 05:10.013
Their commercial featured a talking frog.

05:10.026 --> 05:12.740
So tell those idiots
in the State Capital

05:12.747 --> 05:15.473
to let Union Carbide do their thing.

05:15.478 --> 05:17.800
Paid for by Cartoon Frogs For
Wetlands Destruction.

05:20.497 --> 05:21.782
Howdy, folks!

05:21.796 --> 05:25.163
Are you tired of family arguments
over where to go to dinner?

05:25.168 --> 05:28.913
Sometimes I think about gettin' on
a bus and never comin' back.

05:28.915 --> 05:30.732
Why not try Wes Doobner's World

05:30.738 --> 05:32.553
Famous Family Style Rib Huts?

05:32.606 --> 05:35.363
The rib joint with something
for everyone.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.673
Good luck with my finicky appetite.

05:37.688 --> 05:38.661
We've got ribs.

05:38.667 --> 05:39.173
Sold!

05:39.175 --> 05:40.353
Plain noodles.

05:40.358 --> 05:40.850
Ugh.

05:40.856 --> 05:41.661
With butter.

05:41.668 --> 05:42.610
Yowza!

05:42.617 --> 05:44.081
Texas tofu!

05:44.087 --> 05:45.091
Yummy, yumma!

05:45.097 --> 05:48.730
And the easiest placemat
puzzle in the state.

05:48.737 --> 05:49.663
Let me at it!

05:49.727 --> 05:58.722
<i>We're going to a restaurant grand opening</i>

05:58.728 --> 06:01.703
<i>But don't fill up on bread</i>

06:01.707 --> 06:04.740
That's how they get ya.

06:04.757 --> 06:07.853
That's odd. There doesn't
seem to be anyone here.

06:07.857 --> 06:09.390
More ribs for me!

06:10.486 --> 06:12.373
There aren't any
tables or chairs.

06:12.375 --> 06:13.583
More ribs for me!

06:13.586 --> 06:16.840
I see no grill, oven or food of any kind.

06:16.845 --> 06:18.213
More ribs for me?

06:21.488 --> 06:22.451
Hello,

06:22.455 --> 06:24.080
Simpsons.

06:27.336 --> 06:29.462
Finally, some service.
Now listen.

06:29.478 --> 06:32.203
We want to sit under a cool
state license plate.

06:32.215 --> 06:34.043
Michigan or better.

06:34.048 --> 06:34.862
Silence!

06:34.865 --> 06:37.201
You've all stumbled into my ingenious trap.

06:37.208 --> 06:38.360
That voice!

06:38.441 --> 06:39.152
Oh!

06:39.151 --> 06:41.154
That commercial was a trick.

06:41.152 --> 06:43.653
Specifically designed to lure
our family here.

06:43.669 --> 06:46.611
And "Wes Doobner's World
Famous Family

06:46.618 --> 06:49.560
Style Rib Huts" is actually an
anagram!

06:49.566 --> 06:52.491
Welcome to Sideshow
Bob's World Famous

06:52.495 --> 06:55.400
Family Style Return!

06:55.818 --> 06:56.930
Ahhhhhhh!

06:56.935 --> 06:58.373
Sideshow Bob!

06:58.387 --> 06:59.880
And now you're all going to die,

06:59.888 --> 07:02.102
just because you watched
a television commercial!

07:02.105 --> 07:05.000
Oh, next time a commercial comes on,
I'm gonna close my eyes,

07:05.008 --> 07:07.273
cover my ears and
scream as loud as I can.

07:07.286 --> 07:10.033
Before you die, perhaps
you'd like to know

07:10.037 --> 07:12.663
how I engineered my ultimate revenge.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.712
I'd like to know if Wes Doobner is aware

07:14.715 --> 07:16.903
of what you're doing
in his restaurant.

07:16.928 --> 07:18.781
I'm Wes Doobner.

07:18.785 --> 07:20.323
Mr. Doobner, I havea complaint:

07:20.326 --> 07:22.451
I work hard, and when I
go out with my family,

07:22.457 --> 07:24.152
I expect a certain
level of basic

07:24.158 --> 07:24.822
Shut up!

07:25.136 --> 07:26.792
Now, since last we met...

07:26.797 --> 07:28.481
Oh great, here it comes

07:28.485 --> 07:29.802
all the boring things you've done

07:29.807 --> 07:31.570
since the last time
you didn't kill us.

07:31.575 --> 07:33.603
You never ask what
we've been up to.

07:33.605 --> 07:35.082
We went to the strawberry patch

07:35.087 --> 07:36.981
and I picked the most strawberries!

07:36.998 --> 07:37.720
Shut up!

07:37.726 --> 07:39.753
This time, to liven up my tale,

07:39.758 --> 07:41.212
I brought along some visual aids.

07:41.217 --> 07:42.463
Just call me...

07:42.468 --> 07:44.390
Slideshow Bob!

07:44.778 --> 07:46.462
Nobody do it.

07:46.607 --> 07:49.270
Here, we see Krusty helping
you escape my clutches in Rome.

07:49.275 --> 07:50.160
After that,

07:50.166 --> 07:52.081
my family and I fled to England,

07:52.087 --> 07:54.771
where I found work as a chimney brush.

07:55.656 --> 07:57.130
Here's Buckingham Palace...

07:59.628 --> 08:01.503
Sorry, there's a lot of these...

08:01.695 --> 08:02.612
Bear with me.

08:07.488 --> 08:09.103
Yeah, yeah, we've all been to England.

08:09.107 --> 08:10.521
Is this going somewhere?

08:10.527 --> 08:13.002
I never stopped plotting my revenge.

08:13.466 --> 08:14.791
I snuck into America

08:14.796 --> 08:16.731
amidst a bunch of undocumented
Canadian

08:16.748 --> 08:19.680
comedy writers for
The Jimmy Kimmel Show,

08:19.686 --> 08:20.550
whatever that is.

08:20.657 --> 08:22.493
Then, it was merely a matter

08:22.498 --> 08:24.701
of constructing my trap...

08:24.805 --> 08:26.600
and producing the commercial

08:26.605 --> 08:28.730
that lured you to your dooms.

08:28.767 --> 08:29.480
Which, by the way,

08:29.488 --> 08:31.161
got me an offer to direct a feature.

08:31.166 --> 08:31.770
Which one?

08:31.776 --> 08:34.062
"The Hills Have Eyes Three:
The Hills Still Have Eyes".

08:34.068 --> 08:36.340
And now, the moment
we've all been waiting for...

08:36.345 --> 08:38.171
Finally, the ribs.

08:38.178 --> 08:40.419
You shall all perish
in a tragic accident

08:40.426 --> 08:42.731
caused by a defective laptop battery

08:42.748 --> 08:43.610
that will overheat,

08:43.618 --> 08:47.302
then explode, setting off this TNT.

08:47.306 --> 08:48.441
Hooooooo!

08:48.526 --> 08:49.463
Let's not tarry

08:49.468 --> 08:50.650
as Shakespeare said,

08:50.658 --> 08:52.003
"If it were done when it's done,

08:52.006 --> 08:54.553
then 'twere best it were done quickly. "

08:54.836 --> 08:55.892
Power on.

08:56.926 --> 08:58.231
<i>Looks like you're trying
to blow up the computer.</i>

08:58.238 --> 08:59.531
<i>Mind if hug my kids?</i>

09:00.717 --> 09:01.971
This time,

09:02.178 --> 09:04.261
I've made no mistakes.

09:04.505 --> 09:06.342
Actually, you made one.

09:06.408 --> 09:08.310
What Shakespeare really said was,

09:08.316 --> 09:10.583
"Twere well it were done quickly. "

09:10.586 --> 09:13.221
Yes, I'm sure, you've studied
the Immortal Bard

09:13.225 --> 09:15.152
extensively under your

09:15.157 --> 09:16.663
Miss Hoover.

09:17.578 --> 09:20.031
Macbeth, act one, scene seven.

09:20.035 --> 09:21.090
Look it up!

09:23.605 --> 09:25.371
I shall.

09:30.135 --> 09:31.960
Come on, Wikipedia,

09:31.965 --> 09:34.080
load, you unwieldy behemoth.

09:36.606 --> 09:37.511
Oh, dear

09:37.698 --> 09:39.103
Sideshow Bob,

09:39.107 --> 09:43.023
"hoist on his own petard. "

09:43.026 --> 09:45.172
It's "hoist with
his own petard. "

09:45.186 --> 09:46.231
Oh, get a life.

09:46.365 --> 09:49.581
Yet another new restaurant fails.

09:49.588 --> 09:51.282
Ten-time attempted murderer
and

09:51.288 --> 09:53.600
celebrity Jeopardy
runner-up Sideshow Bob

09:53.607 --> 09:55.792
is in custody again.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.173
Hmm...

10:05.196 --> 10:06.240
Next case...

10:06.248 --> 10:08.482
People versus Sideshow Bob.

10:08.487 --> 10:10.541
Is the defendant's attorney present?

10:10.546 --> 10:11.241
No, your honor.

10:11.285 --> 10:12.940
I choose to represent myself.

10:13.108 --> 10:14.300
And let me say...

10:14.357 --> 10:16.793
I did try to kill the Simpsons.

10:16.807 --> 10:17.741
I truly did.

10:17.745 --> 10:18.743
Ohhhhhhhhh!

10:18.748 --> 10:21.332
Okay, if he doesn't say "but"
right now, we are home free.

10:21.337 --> 10:22.213
- But...
- Damn it!

10:22.218 --> 10:23.362
I plead not guilty,

10:23.366 --> 10:25.060
by reason of insanity!

10:25.066 --> 10:28.160
Insanity caused by my persecution

10:28.167 --> 10:31.331
at the hands of this young boy.

10:31.415 --> 10:32.253
Young?

10:32.265 --> 10:33.880
I'm the oldest kid in my class!

10:33.885 --> 10:35.241
By like two years.

10:35.245 --> 10:37.042
For my first witness I call my father,

10:37.046 --> 10:38.871
Dr. Robert Terwilliger, Senior.

10:39.225 --> 10:41.351
Look, that's Sideshow Bob's mother

10:41.368 --> 10:42.740
Dame Judith Underdunk!

10:42.748 --> 10:45.991
She's the greatest classical
actress of her generation.

10:45.996 --> 10:49.112
Dame Judith, you were brilliant
in Troilus and Cressida.

10:49.118 --> 10:51.610
Did they name the Toyota
Cressida after the play,

10:51.616 --> 10:52.930
or the play after the car?

10:52.938 --> 10:55.520
My son is on trial for his life.

10:55.526 --> 10:57.892
I'm sorry, I know this
is a terrible time.

10:57.895 --> 10:58.891
So just answer quick.

10:58.898 --> 11:00.721
Play first, then car.

11:00.666 --> 11:02.291
I just lost a thousand dollars.

11:02.698 --> 11:04.422
Robert was a peaceful boy,

11:04.587 --> 11:07.401
sickly and weak from
a congenital heart defect.

11:08.906 --> 11:11.871
But then that Simpson boy
started tormenting him,

11:11.996 --> 11:14.111
and he he crossed over
into dementia.

11:14.326 --> 11:17.450
To what degree was
this dementia blown?

11:17.746 --> 11:18.581
Full.

11:19.676 --> 11:21.422
Stop feeling sorry for him!

11:21.578 --> 11:23.321
He's a homicidal maniac!

11:23.517 --> 11:24.681
He deserves to fry!

11:24.788 --> 11:26.863
You see? He knows I'm going
through a rough patch,

11:27.057 --> 11:28.283
still he harangues me.

11:31.176 --> 11:33.820
Who among you have not suffered

11:33.827 --> 11:36.473
at the hands of this demon scamp

11:36.727 --> 11:39.063
and felt the urge for retribution?

11:39.195 --> 11:43.181
He ordered prank pizzas
to 888 Poopy Pants Lane!

11:43.536 --> 11:46.730
Poopy Pants Lane ends
in the 700 block!

11:46.938 --> 11:48.932
He mocked my folksy ways!

11:49.287 --> 11:51.422
He cheats at Uno!

11:57.428 --> 11:58.920
Bob's playing all of you like saps.

11:59.027 --> 12:00.113
This man's a killer!

12:00.637 --> 12:04.172
See how he accuses me
--at my very own trial!

12:04.425 --> 12:05.632
I can take no more!

12:05.827 --> 12:07.020
I... I...

12:07.598 --> 12:09.261
I didn't want to use this,

12:09.715 --> 12:11.322
but you've left me no choice.

12:13.095 --> 12:14.121
Nitroglycerin!

12:14.288 --> 12:15.482
Everybody panic!

12:17.525 --> 12:18.383
Yoink!

12:18.847 --> 12:20.793
Foiled again, freak!

12:21.555 --> 12:24.751
You don't understand!

12:25.147 --> 12:26.681
I... I...

12:34.667 --> 12:36.453
That nitroglycerin was medicine

12:36.688 --> 12:38.672
for Robert's congenital heart
defect.

12:38.838 --> 12:41.251
To which my earlier testimony referred.

12:44.306 --> 12:45.543
This man is dead.

12:45.946 --> 12:47.251
And you killed him.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.120
Ew, gross--

12:49.367 --> 12:50.591
I'm touching a dead guy!

12:53.976 --> 12:56.510
America has a tradition
of turning outlaws

12:56.647 --> 12:59.143
into legends after their deaths:
Billy the Kid,

12:59.365 --> 13:01.302
Bonnie and Clyde,
Jesus Christ.

13:01.627 --> 13:04.983
Joining them now is
Robert "Sideshow Bob" Terwilliger,

13:05.165 --> 13:06.432
whose funeral we're presenting

13:06.596 --> 13:08.270
with live shovel-to-shovel coverage.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.841
And there we see
Bob's grieving parents,

13:10.987 --> 13:13.173
his brother, Cecil, left out the
prison for the occasion,

13:13.586 --> 13:15.643
his widow, Francesca,
and his son, Gino.

13:16.745 --> 13:20.372
Also in attendance are Bob's colleagues
from the world of clowning.

13:20.866 --> 13:23.521
A veritable who's who ha-ha.

13:34.896 --> 13:38.021
<i>Farewell, Sideshow Bob.</i>

13:38.406 --> 13:41.581
<i>Your shoes are empty
and the stage is dark</i>

13:41.845 --> 13:45.283
<i>Bart stole your nitroglycerin</i>

13:45.606 --> 13:48.683
<i>And then your heart infarcked</i>

13:56.877 --> 14:00.493
<i>And it seems to me your loyal fans</i>

14:00.768 --> 14:04.123
<i>Oughta buy this DVD</i>

14:04.618 --> 14:08.241
<i>Of all your best-loved sketches</i>

14:08.326 --> 14:10.632
<i>On The Krusty Show</i>

14:11.956 --> 14:15.521
<i>It's full of extra features</i>

14:16.258 --> 14:19.223
<i>And deleted scenes</i>

14:19.607 --> 14:23.101
<i>Like when you fell
and split your pants</i>

14:23.348 --> 14:27.412
<i>And we saw
your "Frank and Beans."</i>

14:35.927 --> 14:39.091
There's the kid
who killed my best friend!

14:42.076 --> 14:43.090
Buy my DVD.

14:45.907 --> 14:48.522
Bart, I know this is nuts,
but try to look sad.

14:48.665 --> 14:49.672
I'm not sad.

14:49.727 --> 14:51.803
I have nothing to be sad about.
Nothing!

14:52.877 --> 14:55.472
Well, I guess the rest of us
should pay our respects.

14:56.948 --> 14:58.520
Yeah, well, between you and me,

14:58.707 --> 15:00.373
I still can't stand him.

15:00.547 --> 15:01.942
<i>I still can't stand him.</i>

15:02.047 --> 15:03.402
<i>I still can't stand him.</i>

15:03.577 --> 15:04.940
<i>I still can't stand him.</i>

15:05.105 --> 15:05.853
<i>I still can't stand him.</i>

15:05.968 --> 15:07.603
I don't care
about these church jerks.

15:07.858 --> 15:10.430
<i>Church jerks... church jerks...</i>

15:10.995 --> 15:13.213
Homer, your behavior is heinous.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.403
Anus, anus...

15:14.496 --> 15:16.211
anus, anus, anus...

15:16.607 --> 15:18.803
Stupid Sideshow Bob.

15:18.898 --> 15:20.661
Even when he's dead,
he wrecks my life.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.713
I hope he's in hell
eating a barf burger.

15:22.966 --> 15:24.693
I once felt that way, too.

15:24.897 --> 15:26.312
Hey, aren't you Bob's brother?

15:26.445 --> 15:27.633
Biologically, yes,

15:27.638 --> 15:28.833
but we never got along.

15:29.056 --> 15:30.871
He was always
zigging when I zagged.

15:31.158 --> 15:33.173
That summer when he wanted to tour
the castles of Italy,

15:33.288 --> 15:34.863
I wanted to tour
the castles of France.

15:35.076 --> 15:36.321
So we went to Spain,

15:36.326 --> 15:37.563
a compromise that satisfied no one.

15:37.768 --> 15:38.703
That's stupid.

15:38.958 --> 15:40.661
You talk like youre smart,
but you're stupid.

15:40.865 --> 15:43.583
Anyway, I choose to remember
Bob as the big brother

15:43.698 --> 15:45.311
who taught me to play Botticelli.

15:45.576 --> 15:46.362
Sounds boring.

15:46.467 --> 15:47.501
Oh, you'd love it.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.313
It's a guessing game
in which one

15:49.386 --> 15:51.363
player adopts the guise
of a noteworthy--

15:51.595 --> 15:53.090
you're right, it is boring.

15:54.247 --> 15:55.822
But the only way
you'll find happiness

15:56.017 --> 15:57.572
is by making your peace with Bob.

15:57.746 --> 16:00.141
Well, I guess I could say good-bye.

16:00.215 --> 16:01.181
You'd better make it snappy.

16:01.386 --> 16:02.850
They're cremating him in 30 minutes.

16:02.937 --> 16:05.523
I'll be scattering his ashes
over the castles of France.

16:07.137 --> 16:08.491
Take that, ashes.

16:13.608 --> 16:16.300
Hey, Bart! You're on the
front page of the paper.

16:17.138 --> 16:19.502
I'm going to set things right.
Wanna come with me?

16:19.677 --> 16:22.521
I would, but tonight my dad's
taking me to the batting cage.

16:22.695 --> 16:24.750
He's gonna teach me to umpire!

16:24.965 --> 16:26.493
Check it out, an official

16:26.496 --> 16:28.030
Major Leagueball/strike counter!

16:28.276 --> 16:31.500
Ball one, ball two, strike one...

16:32.227 --> 16:33.993
Bart? Bart?

16:41.147 --> 16:42.340
Hi, Lisa.

16:42.538 --> 16:44.170
Hate to mix"B" with "P,"

16:44.298 --> 16:46.450
but your family owes
me for two weeks.

16:46.686 --> 16:48.243
Milhouse, have you seen Bart?

16:48.468 --> 16:49.510
Bart Simpson?

16:49.657 --> 16:51.033
I think he went to pay his

16:51.035 --> 16:52.413
respects to Sideshow Bob.

16:52.736 --> 16:54.563
Mind if I sit down for a second?

16:54.717 --> 16:56.270
My feet are killing me.

16:56.988 --> 16:58.713
Feet... killing?!

16:59.608 --> 17:00.743
We've got to save Bart!

17:00.956 --> 17:02.821
Now?
But I'm getting a home perm.

17:02.957 --> 17:03.692
Now!

17:10.048 --> 17:11.701
Bob, it's me, Bart.

17:11.885 --> 17:14.531
I came here to tell you
I never meant for you to die.

17:14.708 --> 17:17.262
I just wanted you to go to jail
and get beat up a lot.

17:17.548 --> 17:19.483
Now everyone wishes I was dead.

17:19.887 --> 17:22.931
Then let's give the people
what they want!

17:24.165 --> 17:25.252
Sideshow Bob!

17:44.326 --> 17:45.953
Bob planned this
from the beginning.

17:46.055 --> 17:47.613
He wanted to be captured
at the restaurant.

17:47.995 --> 17:49.493
He would never get
a Shakespeare quote wrong.

17:49.578 --> 17:50.070
No.

17:50.257 --> 17:51.701
His mother was a Shakespearian actress.

17:52.555 --> 17:54.323
- His father is a doctor.
- A doctor, huh?

17:54.488 --> 17:56.462
So when Bob collapsed in the courtroom...

17:56.468 --> 17:56.991
I remember.

17:57.156 --> 17:58.642
...his father could take that

17:58.648 --> 17:59.922
opportunity to inject Bob

18:00.047 --> 18:02.682
with a powerful drug
that simulated death.

18:03.196 --> 18:05.230
It was a diabolical scheme, and every

18:05.236 --> 18:07.160
member of his family played a part!

18:07.445 --> 18:09.450
Are you done? 'Cause I've been
circling the funeral home

18:09.577 --> 18:10.752
- for ten minutes.
- Yes.

18:14.795 --> 18:17.802
Cool, I found a trapdoor that
leads to an underground city.

18:18.537 --> 18:19.920
Here I go!

18:24.556 --> 18:27.252
Oh, my God, it's beautiful!

18:27.546 --> 18:29.363
- Are you buying this?
- When they find your ashes,

18:29.475 --> 18:31.041
they'll think it's me.

18:31.245 --> 18:33.950
And I'll be far away
with my loving family.

18:34.187 --> 18:35.881
It's the perfect crime.

18:36.065 --> 18:37.891
And it was my flawless performance

18:38.026 --> 18:40.280
as the grieving brother
that sealed the deal.

18:40.446 --> 18:43.190
Yes, and Hamlet is all about Laertes.

18:43.406 --> 18:46.410
Would you please stop
comparing me to Laertes!

18:46.598 --> 18:48.571
If the doublet fits...

18:54.328 --> 18:56.021
Stop that cremation!

18:56.698 --> 18:58.391
Hey, what smells so good?

18:58.597 --> 19:00.573
Zeus' pimples!

19:04.085 --> 19:06.032
Hot! Hot! Hot!

19:06.328 --> 19:08.450
You're too late, Simpsons!

19:08.665 --> 19:10.181
Eat hobo remains!

19:12.606 --> 19:13.602
Get me out of here!

19:13.786 --> 19:16.202
What are you doing?
I can't breathe!

19:16.338 --> 19:19.482
Marge, he's got to get
over his fear of coffins.

19:22.677 --> 19:24.803
Freeze, Sideshow Snobs!

19:25.786 --> 19:27.023
You're all under arrest.

19:27.257 --> 19:29.723
You have the right to remain silent,
but I hope you don't.

19:30.066 --> 19:32.430
It's a long way to jail
and I like to chitchat.

19:34.746 --> 19:36.062
Wait, I must know.

19:36.267 --> 19:37.933
How did you loosen the tiles

19:37.938 --> 19:39.302
of my mosaic of murder?

19:39.647 --> 19:41.931
I grew suspicious
when I saw the casket

19:42.168 --> 19:44.582
had extra room
built-in for your feet.

19:44.877 --> 19:46.581
Why would your family pay all

19:46.585 --> 19:48.420
that extra money of a dead man?

19:49.475 --> 19:52.413
Damn these glorious gunboats!

19:53.268 --> 19:54.340
Nice try, Bob,

19:54.477 --> 19:56.381
but you didn't count on one thing.

19:56.555 --> 19:59.380
- What's that?
- You stink like my butt!

20:01.127 --> 20:01.903
Take him away!

20:02.338 --> 20:06.313
Oh, why must I feed him
straight lines?!

20:11.198 --> 20:13.822
Well, this time I think Sideshow Bob

20:13.827 --> 20:16.013
is finally locked up for good.

20:16.247 --> 20:17.663
Yeah, the only thing that's

20:17.665 --> 20:19.352
going to be hacked to pieces now

20:19.617 --> 20:21.233
is this celebratory cake!

20:22.968 --> 20:26.153
So who wants a nice big slice?

20:27.017 --> 20:27.831
Slash!

20:27.916 --> 20:29.320
Hack! Die!

20:36.255 --> 20:38.332
There he goes again.

20:38.606 --> 20:40.670
You have 87 years to get
used to it, Father.

20:42.146 --> 20:43.790
East bids two hearts.

20:43.948 --> 20:44.790
Three diamonds.

20:45.066 --> 20:46.131
Three clubs.

20:49.025 --> 20:51.363
The joke's not funny
and the bid's not sufficient.
