00:14.473 --> 00:16.009
Can we leave
Matt out of this?

00:16.100 --> 00:19.968
If you're unhappy, I can
always arrange for you
to return to your former life.

00:20.104 --> 00:22.641
DAPHNE: Just tell me what
I’m supposed to do.
ARTHUR: Stay with Parkman.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.479
I came here looking for you,
and what did I find?

00:24.609 --> 00:27.271
You're waiting for me.
I mean, that's gotta
mean something, right?

00:27.945 --> 00:29.355
GABRIEL: You saved
my life once, Elle.

00:29.447 --> 00:30.778
Don't you see?
I owe you.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.025
I forgive you.

00:32.116 --> 00:33.947
Now you need
to forgive yourself.

00:34.994 --> 00:39.158
Arthur's probably figured out
by now that there's
a third piece of the formula.

00:39.248 --> 00:40.328
It's a catalyst.

00:40.416 --> 00:42.702
Hidden away
in the blood
of a human host.

00:42.793 --> 00:43.953
I think
I'm the catalyst.

It seems
most of the powers
l've documented

took place during the last
total annular eclipse.

MOHINDER:
There’s a moment in every war
where everything changes.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.898
A moment when the road bends.

01:08.736 --> 01:14.527
Alliances and battle lines
shift, and the rules of
engagement are rewritten.

01:15.660 --> 01:18.493
Moments like these
can change the nature
of the battle,

01:19.664 --> 01:22.497
and turn the tide
for either side.

01:23.125 --> 01:26.333
So we do what we can
to understand them.

01:29.131 --> 01:33.124
To be ready for change,
we steady our hearts,

01:33.219 --> 01:39.840
curb our fears,
muster our forces, and
look for signs in the stars.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.640
At these moments,

01:49.735 --> 01:53.944
these game changes
remain a mystery.

Destiny’s invisible hand

01:59.787 --> 02:04.030
No matter how much
we prepare for them,
how much we resist the change,

02:04.125 --> 02:09.165
anticipate the moment,
fight the inevitable outcome,

02:09.255 --> 02:15.342
in the end,
we’re never truly
ready when it strikes.

02:19.223 --> 02:20.963
You're getting
pretty good at that.

02:23.394 --> 02:24.634
You'll get there,
don't sweat it.

02:24.729 --> 02:27.345
Well, I need to
get there now.
l have to prove myself.

02:30.443 --> 02:31.728
To who?

02:32.945 --> 02:35.482
He's nobody,
I'm not sure
you'd understand.

02:39.410 --> 02:41.901
Okay.
Then let's go again.

02:43.372 --> 02:46.990
Gabriel, I need you
to do something.

02:47.084 --> 02:50.042
Find Claire Bennet.
Bring her back to me.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.504
You think you can do that?
Yes, sir,
of course, I can.

02:56.427 --> 02:58.588
I'm going, too.
What?

02:59.847 --> 03:02.759
Well, they're not
gonna make it easy
for you, getting Claire.

03:02.850 --> 03:07.435
You need help,
and l was raised to
be a Company girl.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.137
Hey, wait,
I thought you'd left
all that behind you.

03:10.608 --> 03:13.566
Yeah, well,
it's all I know.

03:14.236 --> 03:15.772
You need help.

03:16.614 --> 03:17.899
Let me help you.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.569
You okay with this,
Dad?

03:22.787 --> 03:25.449
I think the two
of you together,

03:27.375 --> 03:28.785
it's a good pairing.

03:30.252 --> 03:31.958
Let's go get

03:35.466 --> 03:37.457
(SIGHING)
Why is it always me?

03:37.551 --> 03:40.634
You're the catalyst,
Arthur's formula doesn't
work without you.

03:40.763 --> 03:43.971
l have a plan,
but we all have to work
together to stop him.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.556
Okay,
so where's everyone else?

03:45.643 --> 03:49.886
Nathan is going to find
the Haitian, Matt Parkman
will get Hiro Nakamura,

03:49.980 --> 03:53.222
and you, Claire,
have the most
important part to play.

03:53.317 --> 03:54.727
Great!
What's my assignment?

03:54.819 --> 03:57.902
Your assignment
is to keep
from getting caught.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.569
Just stay out
of harm's way.

03:59.657 --> 04:02.774
But I can fight.
I can do more,
I can be more.

We all have
to make sacrifices.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.420
What are you gonna do,
lock me up?

04:17.508 --> 04:20.545
Don't think it hasn't
crossed my mind, but no.

04:21.512 --> 04:23.002
l have another plan.

04:36.861 --> 04:38.317
Hi, Claire-bear.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.819
It's too dangerous
for you to
go there alone.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.287
I'm just going down
there to get the Haitian,
and I'm coming right back.

04:47.371 --> 04:49.111
The Haitian is there
to hunt down
a Level 5 escapee,

04:49.206 --> 04:52.118

Baron Samedi, look.

04:52.209 --> 04:55.326
Baron?
No, it's an alias.

04:55.421 --> 04:58.504
This guy's into some
bad stuff, drug trafficking,
kidnapping, slavery.

04:58.591 --> 05:00.297
I'm telling you, Nathan,
you're going
to need some help.

05:00.384 --> 05:03.592
Pete, I'm not
going down there
to save the country.

05:03.679 --> 05:05.215
Okay, just...

05:06.390 --> 05:08.722
You don't understand.
Then help me out.

05:10.728 --> 05:13.561
When I found my abilities,
I knew who
I was supposed to be.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.558
Okay? But now...
Pete.

05:15.649 --> 05:20.484
Just because you don't have
your abilities, it doesn't
mean you don't have a purpose.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.562
It will if you don't
take me with you.

05:24.450 --> 05:25.781
Nathan...

05:30.581 --> 05:31.661

have it by now.

06:09.954 --> 06:11.319
You said you were
going to cure me!

I've got people on it,
but all our plans
might be for nothing.

06:15.793 --> 06:17.704
What are you talking about?

06:17.795 --> 06:21.208
I drew that.
It's going to happen. Today.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.833
This is Claire Bennet.
She can't die,
it's impossible.

06:25.928 --> 06:29.841
That's my point.
It can't happen,
but it's going to.

You tell me how.

There's an eclipse today.
Yes.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.142
When I first noted
abilities manifesting,
there was an eclipse.

06:42.278 --> 06:44.234
A global event.
You said it was
a coincidence.

06:44.363 --> 06:46.103
Well, I thought
it was, but...
But what?

06:46.198 --> 06:49.190
What does it mean?
Look, I don't know!

06:49.285 --> 06:53.745
But I do know if Claire
Bennet dies, then
the catalyst dies with her.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.659
And there's no hope
for me being cured.

to be scared about him.

12:55.359 --> 12:58.351
Sir, please put down the gun.
You really don't understand
what's happening here.

12:58.445 --> 13:01.653
She filled me in pretty good.
You serial-killing scum
of the earth.

13:01.740 --> 13:04.857
They're all trying
to make you into something.

13:04.952 --> 13:10.743
A boy scout, a monster.
Who's it gonna be, huh?
Who are you really?

13:10.832 --> 13:11.912
Shut up.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.912
I should kill you right now,
say it was self-defense.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.494
I'll be famous,
a bona fide hero.

13:18.382 --> 13:19.371
(GROANS)

13:25.931 --> 13:27.592
I hate heroes.

13:36.900 --> 13:41.940
What does this eclipse mean,
and how could it
possibly affect us?

13:42.030 --> 13:43.531
(COUGHING)

13:44.950 --> 13:48.784
The moon controls
the ocean's waves, the sun,
our internal timing,

13:48.870 --> 13:52.328
but something is
happening to me.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.740
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

13:54.835 --> 13:57.076
l'm changing,
I can feel it.

14:00.716 --> 14:02.456
And I can't control it.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.626
(COUGHING)

14:24.364 --> 14:25.353
(SIGHING)

14:30.162 --> 14:31.197
What's this for?

14:31.288 --> 14:32.448
Hit me with it.

14:33.331 --> 14:36.243
You wanted me to train you?
Let's do it, right here,
right now.

14:37.169 --> 14:41.333
This is how you get over
your guilt? Because I've
been just fine without you.

14:41.423 --> 14:42.708
Have you?

14:42.799 --> 14:44.209
(SCOFFS)

14:44.718 --> 14:45.878
I caught the puppet guy.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.550
Yeah. You got lucky.

14:47.637 --> 14:50.845
And you almost got your
mother killed. These are
serious, dangerous criminals.

14:50.932 --> 14:52.388
I know.
You're not acting like it.

14:52.476 --> 14:54.933
What am I acting like?
Like a girl
who can't get hurt.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.760
Stupid and careless.

14:56.855 --> 14:59.562
What do you know?
You're the one
who left, remember?

14:59.649 --> 15:02.561
My absence does not
give you license
to act like a brat.

15:02.652 --> 15:05.610
l have been trying
to do something
good with my ability.

15:05.697 --> 15:07.278
And I'm trying
to keep you safe.

15:07.365 --> 15:08.741
I don't need your help!

15:08.825 --> 15:10.281
Then hit me.

15:10.911 --> 15:12.447
I said hit me.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.791
(GRUNTING)

15:18.835 --> 15:21.212
The good news is
you've certainly
got the strength.

15:21.296 --> 15:24.003
The bad news is
you're clumsy,
slow and obvious.

15:24.132 --> 15:27.875
Thanks.
This time,
get your body weight into it.

15:27.969 --> 15:31.632
That way all the power will
be on the end of the board.
Okay? Let's go again.

15:33.391 --> 15:34.927
What is this,
Taekwon-Do?

15:35.018 --> 15:37.430
No, it's baseball.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.061
Let's go again.

15:41.316 --> 15:44.479
lt's Tracy.
Nathan's veering off plan.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.109
He's going to find
this Haitian guy.

15:47.197 --> 15:49.779
ARTHUR: That’s smart,
using the Haitian against me.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.906
We can't have that.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.699
You're not gonna hurt him?

15:53.787 --> 15:57.371
I'm learning today
there are some things
out of my control.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.243
What is that
supposed to mean?

15:59.334 --> 16:02.371
It’s time for Nathan
to see the world
for what it really is.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.037
Look, I agreed
to help you

16:06.133 --> 16:08.920
because you said
that we could get Nathan
into the White House.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.216
You need him, Arthur.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.679
So do you.

16:12.722 --> 16:16.135
I need you to go
to Parris Island, use those
connections you've got.

16:16.226 --> 16:17.636
I don't take
orders from you.

16:17.727 --> 16:21.845
If you want your way
into the Oval Office,
you'll do exactly as I say.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.933
Parris Island.

16:30.407 --> 16:32.193
The Marine
training facility?

16:32.284 --> 16:34.525
Every war needs an army.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.367
Washington.

16:40.750 --> 16:41.830
(SIGHS)

16:41.918 --> 16:44.125
I guess there's
no rest
for the wicked.

16:44.212 --> 16:45.793
Obviously not.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.758
I need Hiro
to help me
find Daphne.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.336
But she stole
the formula,
she's a villain.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.046
No, she's not.
She's just scared.

16:56.141 --> 16:57.221
Of what?
I don't know.

16:57.309 --> 16:59.174
I don't know,
but I gotta find out.

16:59.269 --> 17:02.352
(SIGHS) Oh, God,
I told her
that I doubted her.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.562
l practically
packed her bags for her.

17:04.649 --> 17:06.810
Look,
we need to help Hiro.

17:06.902 --> 17:08.483
Get him back to normal,
stop Arthur Petrelli...

17:08.570 --> 17:09.605
But it'll only
take a minute.

17:09.696 --> 17:12.654
All he has to do is
teleport me to Lawrence,
Kansas, I grab Daphne, and...

17:12.741 --> 17:14.197
Lawrence, Kansas?

17:15.785 --> 17:17.400
Lawrence, Kansas.

17:17.495 --> 17:19.827
Yes! That's us.
We're in a cornfield.

17:19.915 --> 17:21.530
She told me
that she grew up
on a corn farm.

17:21.625 --> 17:22.865
Corn farm.
Yeah.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.291
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

17:25.754 --> 17:26.834
Lawrence, Kansas.

17:26.922 --> 17:28.002
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

17:35.055 --> 17:38.343
Holy crap, it worked.
This is it,
this is Daphne's house.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.766
I can hear her thoughts,
she's in there.

17:43.647 --> 17:45.057
Holy crap!

19:44.642 --> 19:46.018
You all right?
Yeah.

19:46.102 --> 19:48.263
Yeah, I'm okay. You?

19:48.938 --> 19:50.064
I'm good.

19:50.148 --> 19:51.183
What happened?

19:51.274 --> 19:53.560
I don't know.
I was flying
and then I wasn't.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.266
l was falling really fast.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.818
And now?

19:56.905 --> 19:58.861
Nothing. I can't fly.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.276
Hey, wasn't there
an eclipse that
first day you flew?

20:04.371 --> 20:06.282
Yeah, so?

20:07.791 --> 20:09.782
So you don't find
that significant?

20:10.794 --> 20:12.876
The guy we're looking for,
the Haitian,
he takes powers away.

20:12.962 --> 20:17.296
Maybe he saw us coming.
I don't know. Maybe it's
this whole damn country.

20:18.635 --> 20:20.421
We gotta find him.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.384
Come on,
let's make tracks.
All right.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.011
Got a long walk
ahead of us.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.978
What the hell are these,
voodoo dolls?

20:36.069 --> 20:40.233
No, they're called pwen.
They're messengers.

20:41.157 --> 20:43.648
Prayers for salvation,
redemption.

20:44.869 --> 20:45.904
Let's go.

20:45.995 --> 20:48.782
Looking at the map,
the Haitian's village
is this way.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.251
I saw it from
two clicks up.

20:52.335 --> 20:53.541
We were falling.

20:53.628 --> 20:54.663
Yeah.

20:55.004 --> 20:56.164
It's still this way.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.292
Hey, are you...
Don't you want...

21:10.812 --> 21:12.348
(DOOR OPENING)

21:14.023 --> 21:16.765
Something I can
do for you?
Hi, yeah.

21:16.860 --> 21:19.818
I'm a friend of Daphne's,
can I talk to her
for a second?

21:19.904 --> 21:21.815
Daphne's not here.

21:21.906 --> 21:25.023
Daphne! I know
you're inside, come on.
ljust need a minute.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.699
DAPHNE: GO away, Matt.

21:29.539 --> 21:32.121
Like I said,
she's not home.

21:32.709 --> 21:36.372
Yeah. Why don't you
just let me inside?

21:37.714 --> 21:39.375
Are you threatening me?

21:43.094 --> 21:47.133
I said let me in.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.801
Why are you turning
your head sideways?

21:53.980 --> 21:55.936
What's your problem,
son?

22:01.446 --> 22:02.481
Psst.

22:02.572 --> 22:04.062
What happened?

22:06.659 --> 22:07.819
My powers are gone.

22:07.911 --> 22:09.242

22:11.414 --> 22:12.915

22:13.124 --> 22:15.331
His also.
What's going on?

22:25.762 --> 22:27.923
Are you gonna
tell me who that was?

22:29.182 --> 22:30.171
Nope.

22:30.266 --> 22:33.178
I'm not asking a lot
of questions here.

22:33.269 --> 22:34.850
And I appreciate that.

22:34.938 --> 22:37.429
But you've been
gone a long time.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.484
It's my home.

22:41.486 --> 22:43.101
Can't I just come home?

22:46.950 --> 22:48.941
Are you feeling okay?

22:51.371 --> 22:52.451
No.

22:57.585 --> 22:59.121
lt's happening again.

23:03.341 --> 23:06.208
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.092
Do you still have them?

23:08.179 --> 23:09.339
Yeah.

23:09.806 --> 23:12.218
Yeah,
I'll go get them.

23:20.316 --> 23:21.647
(ROCKS CLATTERING)

23:24.988 --> 23:27.320
All right.
All right.

23:28.825 --> 23:32.363
If we double back,
we should be able to make it
to the village in an hour.

23:35.331 --> 23:37.617
You're not even
going to admit
you were wrong?

23:37.709 --> 23:40.325
You really want to
get into this now?
Come on.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.832
You gotta stop treating me
like your idiot kid brother.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.584
You read the map right.
Congratulations.

23:45.675 --> 23:47.006
God, | wish I could fly.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.299
But you can't.

23:48.386 --> 23:50.001
That's right,
I'm powerless just like you.

23:50.096 --> 23:52.428
Hey, if it wasn't for me,
you'd be lost and alone.

23:52.515 --> 23:54.756
If it wasn't for you,
I'd be home by now.

23:54.851 --> 23:57.513
I only brought you down here
to protect your fragile ego.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.094
You know what?
I don't need your pity.

23:59.188 --> 24:01.770
No, but you know
what you do need?
My help.

24:01.858 --> 24:03.814
I've been saving
your ass my entire life.

24:03.901 --> 24:04.981
Is that so?
That's right.

24:05.069 --> 24:08.653
When you jumped off
that roof like a moron,
who caught you?

24:08.740 --> 24:11.823
Who pulled you out of
Kirby Plaza when you
were about to blow up?

24:11.909 --> 24:14.446
You want my respect?
You want my approval?
Earn it.

24:14.537 --> 24:17.028
Why would I
want your respect?
You're a puppet.

24:19.292 --> 24:20.281
Excuse me?

24:20.376 --> 24:21.957
You have no spine.

wanted you to be.

24:28.051 --> 24:30.463

His goals.

24:30.553 --> 24:33.090
He would always find
a way to get under
your skin and manipulate you,

24:33.222 --> 24:34.632
use you.

24:36.059 --> 24:37.549
Where's this coming from?

24:41.481 --> 24:43.517
In the future,
you choose him.

24:44.901 --> 24:46.516
You choose Dad,
Nathan.

and I'm trying to stop him.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.740
You wanna help me?

25:00.667 --> 25:04.660
Good! Control first,
follow-through second.
You feel that power?
