All right, how 'bout we
play a little Lordi?

03:34.070 --> 03:35.530
It's pronounced "Lord."

03:35.530 --> 03:40.200
I know that, I meant Lordi,
the Norwegian death metal band.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.160
Lordi is Finnish, not Norwegian.

my yuppie brother

03:46.960 --> 03:48.790
had turned you
into a pod person.

03:48.790 --> 03:51.750
All right, so, this
is the first movie night

03:51.750 --> 03:53.920
in many a moon,
so because of that

03:53.920 --> 03:56.630
I'm gonna let you, m'lady,
choose tonight's feature.

03:56.630 --> 03:59.090
Now, "Re‐Animator"
is at The Rep.

03:59.090 --> 04:02.060
Oh, and "Suspiria"
is at The Independent.

04:04.220 --> 04:07.810
Actually, um, I was
thinking something

04:07.810 --> 04:10.440
a little bit less retro.

04:15.900 --> 04:18.490
Oh, God, are you joking?

04:18.490 --> 04:20.160
Um, no.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.950
"Chosen: The Final Saga"?

04:21.950 --> 04:25.750
Yeah, it's the finale franchise
semi‐reboot of the original.

04:25.750 --> 04:27.410
But now‐‐it says "Part I."

04:27.410 --> 04:30.170
Well, yeah, but they always
split it into two, maybe three,

04:30.170 --> 04:31.040
I can't remember.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.960
Plus the lead's kinda cute.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.210
"Kinda cute‐‐"

04:34.210 --> 04:37.010
There is a treasure trove
of cinematic treats

04:37.010 --> 04:38.510
playing all over
the city tonight

04:38.510 --> 04:40.010
and you wanna go to some

04:40.010 --> 04:42.260
teenybopper franchise
churn‐'em‐out.

04:42.260 --> 04:45.220
I don't know, I think
it looks kinda fun.

04:45.220 --> 04:48.520
Who‐‐who are you and what
have you done with my niece?

04:48.520 --> 04:50.560
Oh, come on, stop
being a curmudgeon.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.560
Let's go!

04:56.740 --> 04:59.570
Tell me again why we're
not seeing a real movie.

04:59.570 --> 05:01.370
Hey, this place is
state‐of‐the‐art.

05:01.370 --> 05:03.160
They just got that
cool new format.

05:03.160 --> 05:04.700
Oh, what, Cinethrax?

05:04.700 --> 05:06.410
What marketing wizard
thought that one up?

05:06.410 --> 05:08.870
Uh, Cineblog said
that it's crazy intense.

05:08.870 --> 05:11.920
Some guy at the first test
screening went totally insane.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.790
They had to roll him
out in a wheelchair.

05:13.790 --> 05:17.130
Oh, oh‐‐so some
geriatric shits himself,

05:17.130 --> 05:18.970
PR jumps all over it,
they hype it up.

05:18.970 --> 05:20.130
See, this is what
they do, Chloe.

05:20.130 --> 05:23.470
They get the cast of
some cancelled CW show,

05:23.470 --> 05:25.850
uh, they put a fresh
coat of CGI on it,

05:25.850 --> 05:27.270
get a fast food tie‐in‐‐

05:27.270 --> 05:28.640
What‐‐what are you‐‐
what is that?

05:28.640 --> 05:30.310
What are you doing, what
are the little hieroglyphics?

05:30.310 --> 05:33.400
Uh, they're called
emojis, your majesty.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.650
I know that, I just‐‐

05:34.650 --> 05:36.190
God forbid people
actually communicate

05:36.190 --> 05:37.480
using real words.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.110
Oh, they have one for you now.

05:39.110 --> 05:41.410
Uh, it's a dog poop
with a smiley face.

05:41.410 --> 05:44.120
Oh, that's‐‐if it was me,
it wouldn't be smiling.

05:45.030 --> 05:47.160
Two for "Chosen:
The Final Saga."

05:47.160 --> 05:49.080
That'll be $57.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.330
What a bargain!

05:51.330 --> 05:54.540
Hey, um, my brother
fronted you a little bit of‐‐

05:54.540 --> 05:56.210
Hey, if you insist.

05:56.210 --> 05:57.340
Two, please.

05:59.630 --> 06:01.050
Theater 12.

06:02.890 --> 06:05.800
Enjoy the show.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.770
We'll try.

06:08.770 --> 06:11.520
Jesus, what is this,
is this a movie theater

06:11.520 --> 06:13.690
or a cyborg art installation?

06:13.690 --> 06:16.190
It's kinda rad.

06:16.190 --> 06:17.690
This place used to show 35mm.

06:17.690 --> 06:20.990
I saw the "Silent Running"
here when I was your age.

06:20.990 --> 06:22.700
God, what a shame.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.280
What are you doing,
you need those.

06:24.280 --> 06:31.160
No, because I came with
an ace up my sleeve.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.750
Old Florida people glasses.

06:34.750 --> 06:35.880
What, no, no.

06:35.880 --> 06:37.880
The‐‐these are called shifters.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.340
They take 3D
and they flatten in out

06:40.340 --> 06:41.720
into regular 2D.

06:41.720 --> 06:44.220
And you just happen to have
these on you at all times?

06:44.220 --> 06:47.550
Well, Chloe, I always
feared for the day

06:47.550 --> 06:50.310
that you took me to a 3D movie.

06:50.310 --> 06:54.390
I just didn't know
it would happen so soon.

06:54.390 --> 06:57.110
Here, I got you a pair.

06:57.110 --> 07:00.440
It was two for one
on Cyber Monday.

07:00.440 --> 07:03.820
I'm not gonna wear these,
I'm gonna look like a weirdo.

07:03.820 --> 07:05.910
You‐‐but you're in a theater.

07:05.910 --> 07:08.410
Uh, yeah, surrounded by people.

07:08.410 --> 07:09.870
Surr‐‐

07:09.870 --> 07:13.750
You're worried about what
those people are gonna think?

07:13.750 --> 07:15.710
I might.

07:15.710 --> 07:17.000
Okay, let me level with you.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.210
Are these gonna
make you look weird?

07:18.210 --> 07:19.170
Yes.

07:19.170 --> 07:21.840
Are people gonna point,
stare, laugh?

07:21.840 --> 07:23.380
Maybe, maybe.

07:23.380 --> 07:24.380
Should you care?

07:24.380 --> 07:25.760
No, absolutely not.

07:25.760 --> 07:28.100
Listen, Chloe, people are
always gonna try to shame you

07:28.100 --> 07:31.850
into some brainwashed version
of normalcy, all right?

07:31.850 --> 07:32.970
You can't.

07:32.970 --> 07:36.140
All right, keep Chloe weird.

07:39.480 --> 07:41.110
‐Fine.
‐Yeah!

07:41.110 --> 07:43.490
Just don't post any
pictures on Instagram.

07:43.490 --> 07:45.780
Yeah, I don't think you
have to worry about that.

07:45.780 --> 07:47.070
‐Okay.
‐All right.

07:47.070 --> 07:50.240
Well, I'll get the seats,
you get the snacks.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.950
‐That cool?
‐Yes, that is cool.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.620
All right.

07:54.620 --> 07:57.120
Let's rock and roll.

07:58.290 --> 08:00.880
Rosemary scrambled quail eggs,

08:00.880 --> 08:04.720
the tofu dog with mango aioli.

08:04.720 --> 08:07.630
We also have a vegan
sausage biscuit

08:07.630 --> 08:09.720
with jalapeño chutney.

08:13.140 --> 08:17.140
Popcorn.

08:17.140 --> 08:18.270
Yeah, we got that.

08:18.270 --> 08:19.810
Regular or jumbo?

08:19.810 --> 08:21.650
Dude, jumbo.

08:22.690 --> 08:26.280
His clothes are totally cash.

08:26.280 --> 08:29.240
Can I help you young
ones with something?

08:29.240 --> 08:32.120
Are you sure you're
in the right place?

08:32.120 --> 08:33.490
Yeah, sure.

08:33.490 --> 08:36.830
Well, the silent film
theater's across the street.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.700
Do you wanna go get a burger?

09:16.120 --> 09:18.040
Oh, excuse me, sir.

09:18.040 --> 09:20.290
I should get back.

09:20.290 --> 09:22.500
Big night.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.670

‐Later, Zach.

09:28.840 --> 09:29.880
Popcorn?

09:29.880 --> 09:31.890
Oh, sorry, maybe later.

09:31.890 --> 09:34.810
Oh, well, you know,
there's two amazing seats

09:34.810 --> 09:36.390
up in the phantom center.

09:36.390 --> 09:38.060
Yeah, yeah, I know, um,

09:38.060 --> 09:40.640
but there's more space
down here and I just‐‐

09:40.640 --> 09:41.940
Space for what?

09:41.940 --> 09:43.110
Hey, bitch, what's up?!

09:43.110 --> 09:44.690
Oh my God, girl, what's up?

09:44.690 --> 09:47.280
Oh my gosh, I totally
saw you macking on Zach.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.650
Just do him already.

09:49.650 --> 09:52.320
Um, Uncle Dusty,
these are my friends,

09:52.320 --> 09:53.280
Brie and Alexis.

09:53.280 --> 09:55.450
That's my Uncle Dusty.

09:55.450 --> 09:56.990
Hey.

09:56.990 --> 09:58.620
Yeah, we go way back.

10:00.330 --> 10:04.290
Uh, just give me a second.

10:04.290 --> 10:05.500
What is going on?

10:05.500 --> 10:07.420
I thought movie night
was our thing.

10:07.420 --> 10:08.840
I haven't seen you in forever.

10:08.840 --> 10:09.920
I know, I know,

10:09.920 --> 10:12.590
but, look, these
girls are really cool

10:12.590 --> 10:15.760
and we never get
to hang out and...

10:15.760 --> 10:17.600
they know Zach, I'm sorry.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.930
Okay, well, where
am I supposed to sit?

10:19.930 --> 10:22.060
Well, there's still
that one seat up

10:22.060 --> 10:23.980
in the phantom center.

10:26.650 --> 10:29.860
You mean, like, alone?

10:29.860 --> 10:31.110
Okay, you know what,
no, I'm fine,

10:31.110 --> 10:32.780
I will tough it out down here

10:32.780 --> 10:34.820
in the front row with you guys.

10:34.820 --> 10:36.120
Ew.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.370
Really, um,
are you sure, 'cause‐‐

10:38.370 --> 10:40.290
No, no, there's a seat
right behind you,

10:40.290 --> 10:44.790
next to... that... guy.

10:44.790 --> 10:46.710
I'll be fine.

10:46.710 --> 10:48.130
You're not being
sarcastic, Uncle Dusty,

10:48.130 --> 10:49.460
right now, are you?

10:49.460 --> 10:53.050
Maverick, I have got your six.

10:53.050 --> 10:56.600
‐Boom.
‐Oh, yeah, there you go.

11:00.850 --> 11:04.440
Uh, hey, uh,
Boromir, do you mind?

11:04.440 --> 11:08.320
I am genderbent Coltantha.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.280
That's great.

11:10.280 --> 11:12.650
Mom did a great
job on the sword.

11:12.650 --> 11:14.740
She only bought the materials.

11:14.740 --> 11:17.120
Oh my God.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.660
Look, look, here he comes.

11:18.660 --> 11:19.910
Hello, everyone.

11:19.910 --> 11:24.790
Who's excited to see
"Chosen: The Final Saga Part I"

11:24.790 --> 11:26.170
in Cinethrax?

11:27.670 --> 11:29.840
He gave me some gum earlier.

11:29.840 --> 11:30.920
Cool.

11:30.920 --> 11:33.670
Are you gonna spit
it out or swallow?

11:33.670 --> 11:35.130
Oh my God!

11:35.130 --> 11:37.970
Well, we want to make this
film as immersive as possible,

11:37.970 --> 11:39.640
so please turn off your phones

11:39.640 --> 11:41.510
and remain silent
during the movie.

11:41.510 --> 11:45.060
Just sit back, open your minds,

11:45.060 --> 11:47.520
put your Cinethrax glasses on,

11:47.520 --> 11:49.190
and enjoy the show.

11:58.110 --> 11:59.240
Nice shades.

11:59.240 --> 12:01.450
Do you have diabetes
or something?

12:01.450 --> 12:03.660
Oh... I know, right?

12:03.660 --> 12:06.870
Someone just must have
left these under my seat.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.720
It's showtime.

12:20.720 --> 12:23.970
Your world is about to change.

12:23.970 --> 12:27.140
Brace yourself for the
next dimension of cinema.

12:27.140 --> 12:30.650
Brace yourself for Cinethrax.

12:47.580 --> 12:50.420
Embrace the experience.

12:51.580 --> 12:54.420
This is gonna suck.

13:12.270 --> 13:15.530
All my life they told
me I had to choose.

13:15.530 --> 13:18.990
You must choose, Chosen.

13:18.990 --> 13:23.450
Well, today I choose...
to fight!

13:38.800 --> 13:40.180
Whoa!

13:56.270 --> 13:59.490
All my life I was
told I had to choose.

13:59.490 --> 14:01.990
But, you know,
from the moment I was born,

14:01.990 --> 14:05.580
the day they named me
the Chosen One,

14:05.580 --> 14:08.410
I never felt like
I had a choice...

14:10.830 --> 14:12.960
...until now.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.580
Even if it is my destiny,

14:14.580 --> 14:16.250
I choose to follow it.

14:16.250 --> 14:17.710
Hey!

14:17.710 --> 14:19.670
Hey!

14:19.670 --> 14:21.800
Hey, uh, Chloe's friend,

14:21.800 --> 14:23.090
there's no texting.

14:23.090 --> 14:24.390
Can I help you?

14:24.390 --> 14:26.680
Can you‐‐you know,
I don't know, maybe.

14:26.680 --> 14:29.020
Your friend, her phone
is distracting

14:29.020 --> 14:30.020
the other people in the theater.

14:30.020 --> 14:31.680
‐Shh!
‐lt's on vibrate!

14:31.680 --> 14:33.350
It shouldn't be on anything.

14:33.350 --> 14:35.310
All right, didn't you see the
little cartoon at the beginning?

14:35.310 --> 14:36.820
There's no texting.

14:36.820 --> 14:38.530
What are you, like a cop?

14:38.530 --> 14:41.070
What‐‐what are you,
like her lawyer?

14:41.070 --> 14:42.070
Oh God.

14:42.070 --> 14:44.280
Sprechen sie English?

14:44.280 --> 14:46.070
God, Chloe,
can you believe this?

14:46.070 --> 14:48.080
Shh!

14:48.080 --> 14:52.330
Um, maybe just put it on
silent 'til the movie's over?

14:55.040 --> 14:56.710
Thank you.

14:59.300 --> 15:02.590
I am Coltantha, the Chosen One.

15:02.590 --> 15:04.930
Let me see.

15:04.930 --> 15:06.260
Don't be shy.

15:06.260 --> 15:07.550
Your digitask could hold the key

15:07.550 --> 15:09.470
to Chancellor Huxley's weakness.

15:13.310 --> 15:14.560
Okay.

15:41.090 --> 15:43.630
Well, what do they say, Steve?

15:44.800 --> 15:48.600
Perhaps the enemy
is not who they seem.

15:48.600 --> 15:51.850
The true menace
has yet to be revealed.

15:51.850 --> 15:54.430
What does that mean?

15:54.430 --> 15:57.310
We just need to
be careful is all.

15:57.310 --> 15:59.020
What does that mean?

15:59.020 --> 16:03.480
We can't be sure
who's foe... or friend.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.450
What does that mean?

16:09.490 --> 16:11.450
Do you remember how we met?

16:11.450 --> 16:13.450
How quickly you stole
my sword from me?

16:15.540 --> 16:16.620
Yeah.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.630
Yeah, yeah,
you scared me, Coltantha.

16:23.090 --> 16:24.300
You still do.

16:24.300 --> 16:26.590
Hey, could I borrow
your glasses really quick?

16:26.590 --> 16:28.970
‐What, no!
‐Just for a second, come on.

16:28.970 --> 16:30.470
Dude, get your own.

16:30.470 --> 16:33.010
No, I... threw mine away.

16:33.010 --> 16:34.220
Well, that was stupid.

16:34.220 --> 16:36.140
Well‐‐I just‐‐

16:36.140 --> 16:39.600
Sometimes you can be so thick.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.900
When are you gonna
realize that you are home,

16:42.900 --> 16:47.030
that you do belong... with us?

16:49.740 --> 16:51.070
With me.

16:53.870 --> 16:57.000
Chloe, hey, really quick,
put your shifters back on,

16:57.000 --> 16:57.910
tell me what you see.

16:57.910 --> 16:59.000
Not now, Dusty.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.580
No, I just wanna check
something, okay?

17:00.580 --> 17:02.590
We can talk about the format
when the movie's over!

17:02.590 --> 17:03.880
No, it's not that,
it's not that‐‐

17:03.880 --> 17:06.839
‐Shh, oh my God!
‐Excuse me?

17:06.839 --> 17:09.630
So you can talk all you
want but we can't text?

17:09.630 --> 17:12.349
I have a legitimate
question about the film.

17:12.349 --> 17:14.560
The film, it's the big
video that's showing

17:14.560 --> 17:16.849
behind your little
phone screens.

17:16.849 --> 17:19.520
Please don't ruin
this for me, okay?

17:19.520 --> 17:21.900
Fine!

17:28.740 --> 17:30.200
Oh, Coltantha.

17:58.220 --> 17:59.640
The hell?

18:01.310 --> 18:03.150
Oh!

18:27.340 --> 18:29.090
Okay, okay.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.580
When are you gonna
realize that you are home,

18:57.580 --> 19:02.580
that you do belong... with us?

19:02.580 --> 19:04.120
It's not that simple.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.210
Yes, it is.

19:14.930 --> 19:16.340
Holy balls!

19:16.340 --> 19:19.470
‐Oh, Jesus Christ!
‐Dusty, calm down, what's wrong?

19:19.470 --> 19:21.640
God, there's something
loose in this theater!

19:21.640 --> 19:23.310
Yeah, a big dumb loud guy.

19:23.310 --> 19:24.810
‐Shut up.
‐No, no, not me.

19:24.810 --> 19:28.310
There's‐‐there's something
coming off of the screen!

19:28.310 --> 19:30.320
It's just the 3D, idiot.

19:30.320 --> 19:31.610
Yeah, I know, idiot.

19:31.610 --> 19:34.360
Chloe, keep your feet up,
it could be anywhere.

19:34.360 --> 19:35.570
Is there a problem, sir?

19:35.570 --> 19:36.990
‐Oh my God.
‐Yes, there's a big problem,

19:36.990 --> 19:39.950
there's a big tentacle snaky
thing loose on the floor.

19:39.950 --> 19:43.080
Okay, sir, how 'bout we
discuss this in the lobby?

19:43.080 --> 19:44.210
What, no, no!

19:44.210 --> 19:45.290
Chloe, come with me.

19:45.290 --> 19:46.540
Chloe, it's not safe.

19:46.540 --> 19:47.880
Chloe!

19:53.760 --> 19:55.470
I'll be right back, okay?

19:55.470 --> 19:57.680
A monster reaching
out of the screen

19:57.680 --> 19:58.850
and attacking people?

19:58.850 --> 20:00.720
I know it sounds crazy, okay?

20:00.720 --> 20:03.180
That's not crazy,
that's Cinethrax.

20:03.180 --> 20:04.680
It's the next
dimension in cinema.

20:04.680 --> 20:07.190
It's‐‐no, it's not
part of the film, okay?

20:07.190 --> 20:10.310
There was an actual thing
coming out of the screen.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.570
It‐‐it was this
close to my face.

20:12.570 --> 20:14.240
Yeah, man, that's Cinethrax.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.740
You know, it's so believable
you think you're there.

20:18.570 --> 20:20.410
Can I talk to an adult?

20:20.410 --> 20:21.530
I am an adult.

20:21.530 --> 20:22.990
Oh, that's adorable.

20:22.990 --> 20:25.790
Uh, can I talk to a manager?

20:25.790 --> 20:26.910
I am the manager.

20:26.910 --> 20:28.540
You're the m‐‐ what are you, 12?

20:28.540 --> 20:29.750
What are we in, Narnia?

20:29.750 --> 20:32.210
‐Dusty!
‐Dustin, at this cinema,

20:32.210 --> 20:34.550
we believe that the
customer's always right.

20:34.550 --> 20:36.220
However, I do have to point out

20:36.220 --> 20:39.140
that no one else in there had
a problem with the projection.

20:39.140 --> 20:40.890
Okay, so I'm‐‐
so I'm making this up?

20:40.890 --> 20:42.720
I'm crazy, is that
what you're saying?

20:42.720 --> 20:43.890
No, but...

20:43.890 --> 20:45.730
Look, maybe it was
just your weird glasses

20:45.730 --> 20:47.640
messing with the 3D.

20:47.640 --> 20:49.400
Wait, hold on a second.

20:49.400 --> 20:52.860
You were wearing unauthorized
third‐party eyewear?

20:52.860 --> 20:54.940
They're‐‐they're
called shifters.

20:54.940 --> 20:57.070
Ah, and these shifters,
you were wearing them

20:57.070 --> 21:01.030
when the tentacle
monster appeared?

21:01.030 --> 21:02.280
Yes.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.830
And what happened when
you took the shifters off?

21:04.830 --> 21:06.870
The‐‐

21:06.870 --> 21:09.170
It disappeared but‐‐the‐‐

21:09.170 --> 21:10.420
‐Right.
‐Okay, whatever.

21:10.420 --> 21:12.920
I'm just telling you
what I saw, all right?

21:12.920 --> 21:14.800
Or what I thought I saw.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.550
You know what,
we will just get a refund

21:17.550 --> 21:20.470
and we will be
on our way, all right?

21:20.470 --> 21:24.680
Um, actually, I'd like
to stay and finish the movie.

21:24.680 --> 21:26.020
Oh, well, okay, you know what?

21:26.020 --> 21:28.680
That's too bad because
the train is leaving, all right?

21:28.680 --> 21:31.190
‐Come on, Chloe.
‐No.

21:34.190 --> 21:35.480
N‐‐

21:35.480 --> 21:37.820
Okay, I'm sorry,
did I embarrass you

21:37.820 --> 21:39.110
in front of your little friends?

21:39.110 --> 21:40.490
Yes.

21:40.490 --> 21:41.660
Yes, you did.

21:41.660 --> 21:42.910
You've been
embarrassing me all night

21:42.910 --> 21:45.790
and the worst part is
you don't even care.

21:45.790 --> 21:47.370
That‐‐like hell I don't.

21:47.370 --> 21:50.620
Well, this cute monster stunt is
one hell of a way of showing it.

21:52.290 --> 21:53.460
Chloe.

21:53.460 --> 21:55.960
Look, you‐‐you say you
want me to stay weird,

21:55.960 --> 21:57.800
but you just want me
to be like you.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.970
Well, I don't want
to be like you,

21:59.970 --> 22:01.300
not if you're going
to act like this.

22:01.300 --> 22:04.390
I want my own friends
my own age.

22:04.390 --> 22:06.310
I want to fit in,
okay, I want to

22:06.310 --> 22:08.560
and... if you have
such a problem with that

22:08.560 --> 22:11.190
then you can just...

22:11.190 --> 22:12.730
you can just go to hell.

22:15.060 --> 22:17.320
‐Chloe‐‐ ‐I'll find a ride home.

22:17.320 --> 22:18.690
Wait, Chloe, Chloe.

22:18.690 --> 22:19.690
No, Chloe, wait.

22:19.690 --> 22:21.070
‐Chloe‐‐ ‐Sorry, sir.

22:21.070 --> 22:22.450
We can't let you back in there.

22:22.450 --> 22:23.990
What are you‐‐are you serious,
this is bullshit!

22:23.990 --> 22:27.160
Look, man, do you really wanna
cause a bigger scene right now?

22:27.160 --> 22:28.450
I‐‐I don't‐‐I‐‐

22:28.450 --> 22:30.710
‐Shit!
‐Hey, tell you what,

22:30.710 --> 22:32.330
we've got a place
where you can hang,

22:32.330 --> 22:34.460
wait the movie out,
and if you seem chill,

22:34.460 --> 22:36.040
then maybe I can
get you back in.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.250
Cool?

22:39.170 --> 22:41.170
Fi‐‐fine, let's go, let's go.

22:55.100 --> 22:56.520
Come on in.

22:57.860 --> 22:59.280
Excuse me.

23:07.870 --> 23:11.330
‐What's going on?
‐lt's fine.

23:11.330 --> 23:12.500
I'll take care of it.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.060
Have a look.

23:31.270 --> 23:33.730
Chloe's right down there,
safe and sound.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.610
So you're cool Uncle Dusty, huh?

23:47.700 --> 23:49.830
Chloe talks about
you all the time.

23:49.830 --> 23:51.660
‐Oh.
‐Yeah, you've seen, like,

23:51.660 --> 23:53.750
every movie ever, right?

23:53.750 --> 23:57.210
‐I've seen a few.
‐Yeah, that's what Chlo said.

23:57.210 --> 24:01.420
Have you seen "L'arrivée d'un
Train en Gare de La Ciotat"?

24:03.970 --> 24:05.970
Uh, what?

24:05.970 --> 24:07.590
"Train Pulling Into a Station"?

24:07.590 --> 24:12.140
Lumière Brothers, 1895, it's,
like, the first short film.

24:12.140 --> 24:15.310
Oh, I‐‐yes, I've seen that one.

24:15.310 --> 24:19.020
You know, when they showed
it at Le Grand Café,

24:19.020 --> 24:21.110
the audience actually
thought a train

24:21.110 --> 24:23.530
was gonna come out
of the screen.

24:23.530 --> 24:26.400
They ran screaming
from their seats.

24:27.410 --> 24:28.910
Does that sound familiar?

24:30.320 --> 24:32.660
Good thing they didn't play
that on Cinethrax, right?

24:38.250 --> 24:39.580
Aw, look, I'm sorry.

24:39.580 --> 24:42.290
No offense, all right,
but... I gotta say,

24:42.290 --> 24:44.130
from one film buff to another,

24:44.130 --> 24:47.170
your apprehension surprises me.

24:47.170 --> 24:53.180
Cinethrax is just like color
or sound or cinema itself.

24:53.180 --> 24:56.890
You know, but, you know,
change, it can be scary

24:56.890 --> 24:58.940
but there's no
stopping progress,

24:58.940 --> 25:00.860
so why resist?

25:05.150 --> 25:07.860
It's like watching
"Star Wars" for the first time.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.840
It's really that good?

25:23.840 --> 25:27.970
Try it, don't try it,
it's all the same to me.

25:27.970 --> 25:29.840
But let me put it
to you this way:

25:29.840 --> 25:32.140
do you wanna keep
being cool Uncle Dusty

25:32.140 --> 25:35.140
or do you want to be the guy
who ran away from the train?

25:43.520 --> 25:45.070
You know what?

25:49.030 --> 25:50.400
Fuck you.

25:55.200 --> 25:56.450
Should we do it now?

26:04.210 --> 26:06.210
Your wickedness and foolishness

26:06.210 --> 26:09.670
tempt me to hate you.

26:09.670 --> 26:11.880
I'm afraid, Chosen.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.640
This is worse than the‐‐

26:36.580 --> 26:38.790
Oh my God.

26:38.790 --> 26:40.250
Oh, Chloe, Chloe.

27:40.060 --> 27:41.350
Come on, check in here.

28:20.260 --> 28:21.430
Fuck.

28:24.520 --> 28:25.940
Shit.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.250
Here they come.

28:47.250 --> 28:49.380
Look out, get down!

28:49.380 --> 28:52.840
Quick, take this...
to the citadel.

28:52.840 --> 28:54.210
Hi, this is Chloe.

28:54.210 --> 28:56.220
I literally never
check these messages.

28:56.220 --> 28:57.800
Text me or something, okay?

28:58.970 --> 29:01.600
Uncle Dusty.

29:05.430 --> 29:08.770
Are you in there,
little Uncle Dusty, huh?

29:20.910 --> 29:22.280
I missed you, you know?

29:22.280 --> 29:24.080
I thought that you
had left forever.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.330
I couldn't leave you.

29:25.330 --> 29:27.910
But you did, you left me!

29:27.910 --> 29:30.420
I did that one time
but I couldn't do it again.

29:31.580 --> 29:34.170
So much has changed,
W, I've changed!

29:34.170 --> 29:36.300
I'm not that little girl
that you hung out with

29:36.300 --> 29:37.340
at the citadel.

29:37.340 --> 29:38.920
Shit, stupid‐‐

29:41.930 --> 29:44.640
Uncle Dusty, are you in there?

29:49.600 --> 29:53.400
Somethings never change, Chosen.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.860
Don't call me that!

29:55.860 --> 29:57.440
See what I mean?

29:57.440 --> 29:58.690
Fuck!

30:01.280 --> 30:02.820
Come on, buddy, open up!

30:04.280 --> 30:06.870
Giving in isn't
the same as giving up.

31:02.670 --> 31:04.340
Uncle Dusty!

32:01.820 --> 32:03.940
‐Join us, Chlo.
‐Totally, do it.

32:03.940 --> 32:06.570
Embrace the experience.

32:06.570 --> 32:09.070
Embrace the experience.

32:09.070 --> 32:11.580
Embrace the experience.

32:11.580 --> 32:14.200
Embrace the experience.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.960
‐Join us, Chlo.
‐Join us, Chlo.

32:25.130 --> 32:28.180
Embrace the experience.

32:28.180 --> 32:30.930
Embrace the experience.

32:30.930 --> 32:34.140
Embrace the experience.

33:04.670 --> 33:07.300
Embrace the experience.

33:07.300 --> 33:10.050
Embrace the experience.

33:10.050 --> 33:12.600
Embrace the experience.

33:12.600 --> 33:15.310
‐No!
‐Embrace the experience.

33:15.310 --> 33:17.980
‐No!
‐Embrace the experience.

33:17.980 --> 33:21.360
‐No!
‐Embrace the experience.

33:21.360 --> 33:23.520
Embrace the experience.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.690
Embrace the experience.

34:03.270 --> 34:04.440
Dusty!

34:18.870 --> 34:20.290
'Sup, Chlo?

34:24.710 --> 34:26.460
Let us go, you assholes.

34:26.460 --> 34:27.920
Hey.

34:27.920 --> 34:29.170
Shh.

34:29.170 --> 34:30.380
Relax.

34:30.380 --> 34:32.630
Everything's gonna be all right.

34:36.760 --> 34:41.730
You know, in a way,

34:41.730 --> 34:43.770
we envy the both of you...

34:45.310 --> 34:46.650
...seein' it again...

34:49.190 --> 34:51.650
...for the first time.

34:51.650 --> 34:54.199
To feel its touch inside us.

34:54.199 --> 34:57.280
To sense ourselves
connecting to something...

34:57.280 --> 34:59.790
‐Wonderful.
‐... wonderful.

34:59.790 --> 35:02.580
Zach, please don't hurt him.

35:02.580 --> 35:03.790
Hurt him?

35:03.790 --> 35:05.630
Is that what you think this is?

35:05.630 --> 35:08.250
Dude, you got it all wrong.

35:08.250 --> 35:11.420
Do you think it came all
this way just to hurt us?

35:11.420 --> 35:13.630
It came to unite us.

35:13.630 --> 35:15.640
It came to make us one.

35:16.970 --> 35:20.270
Do you know how unhappy
I was before Cinethrax came?

35:22.060 --> 35:23.850
I was angry.

35:23.850 --> 35:25.520
I was confused.

35:25.520 --> 35:26.860
I was just like you.

35:26.860 --> 35:28.360
I was alone.

35:30.150 --> 35:34.450
Well... I'm not alone anymore.

35:34.450 --> 35:36.160
And you don't have to be either.

35:50.130 --> 35:51.300
No!

35:53.550 --> 35:54.880
Come on, Dusty.

35:54.880 --> 35:58.550
Your body is host
to trillions of organisms.

36:00.930 --> 36:02.270
What's one more?

36:02.270 --> 36:03.810
No, no!

36:06.730 --> 36:08.980
Embrace the experience.

36:08.980 --> 36:11.650
Embrace the experience.

36:11.650 --> 36:14.320
Embrace the experience.

36:14.320 --> 36:16.660
Embrace the experience.

36:16.660 --> 36:19.160
Embrace the experience.

36:19.160 --> 36:21.030
Embrace the experience.

36:40.470 --> 36:41.850
‐Are you...?
‐No.

36:41.850 --> 36:43.180
‐Are you?
‐No.

36:43.180 --> 36:44.680
‐Okay.
‐Okay.

36:49.810 --> 36:51.440
You guys still don't get it.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.400
The world is about to change

36:53.400 --> 36:56.190
and if you don't adapt
you'll die!

37:05.870 --> 37:08.420
No, Chloe, Chloe!

37:08.420 --> 37:10.330
No, no!

37:10.330 --> 37:12.960
Don't look, Chloe, no!

37:28.890 --> 37:30.900
Hey, asshole.

37:30.900 --> 37:32.270
Huh?

37:32.270 --> 37:34.070
Embrace this.

37:46.580 --> 37:47.950
Come on, Chloe.

37:51.170 --> 37:52.920
Come on, Chloe, let's go.

37:55.800 --> 37:57.420
Chloe, let's go.

38:01.260 --> 38:02.430
Go?

38:04.260 --> 38:05.760
There's nowhere to go.

38:07.770 --> 38:10.770
They were right,
it doesn't hurt.

38:10.770 --> 38:12.440
No, go, Chlo‐‐Chloe, no.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.440
Chloe, snap out of it,
snap out of it, okay?

38:14.440 --> 38:16.980
‐We're almost free.
‐We are free.

38:16.980 --> 38:18.780
All of us,
our world has changed.

38:18.780 --> 38:20.320
You don't have to
be afraid anymore.

38:20.320 --> 38:21.950
No, no, okay,
you're still in there,

38:21.950 --> 38:23.320
I know you're still in there.

38:23.320 --> 38:25.490
Of course I'm still in here.

38:25.490 --> 38:26.950
We all are.

38:26.950 --> 38:28.700
No, listen, we can‐‐
I'll get you outta here,

38:28.700 --> 38:32.420
I'll get you outta here, okay,
everything's gonna be okay!

38:32.420 --> 38:34.630
Everything already is.

38:36.130 --> 38:37.300
Oh God.

38:37.300 --> 38:38.550
Oh God.

38:55.310 --> 38:57.770
Please don't go.

38:57.770 --> 39:00.440
You know how lonely
it is out there.

39:00.440 --> 39:03.110
Stay with me and you'll
never be alone again.

39:03.110 --> 39:05.370
Stay and watch the movie.

39:07.830 --> 39:11.540
What, just bend over for
some galactic hive mind?
