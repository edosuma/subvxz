No, it's fine. It's fine.

should just about cover it,

Oh, come along, Emily.

08:22.303 --> 08:26.553
Why must we live opposite a decrepit
eyesore we all complain about?

08:26.637 --> 08:27.763
- Very true.
- So, all I need you to do

08:27.928 --> 08:31.104
is to write some letters of support
to the council.

and come back tonight?

08:48.262 --> 08:50.720
Oh, well, I'm sorry,
but I'm having dinner with Philip tonight.

08:50.803 --> 08:52.688
Oh! You can cancel him. He's only your son.

08:52.887 --> 08:55.387

else over one of your dinners.

what to do without his best friend.

come on, you at least need a good time.

09:17.470 --> 09:22.345
Well, you know me. I just... Mediocre times,
that's about all I can handle right now.

09:22.428 --> 09:25.853
You need to break out of this, Emily.
No, you know what I'm saying?

09:26.262 --> 09:27.553
If you wait too long,

09:27.637 --> 09:31.643

out of the money I told him about.

a bit neglected, that's all.

Of course, if you do want to thank me,

27:34.345 --> 27:36.811
you could start by getting
that planning letter out.

27:37.678 --> 27:39.595
It's still not up on the council website yet.

27:39.678 --> 27:41.137
Look, you know, I...

27:41.220 --> 27:43.845
I don't really know about
this whole housing scheme.

27:43.928 --> 27:48.898
I was... I was just down there and there's
amazing wildlife around that hospital.

27:49.637 --> 27:52.601
And when were you gonna tell us that it's
your husband that's behind the whole thing?

27:53.178 --> 27:56.012
(LAUGHS) Ah, I see.

27:56.095 --> 27:57.762
That explains the empty clipboard.

27:57.845 --> 27:58.888
What were you doing down there?

27:59.512 --> 28:01.678
What? I got lost.

28:01.762 --> 28:03.599
I thought you got distracted.

28:03.720 --> 28:04.762
Well, I got...

28:04.845 --> 28:09.387
Listen, that old hospital has been
dragging down property prices for years.

All I'm asking here is for a little support
from my friends

28:12.887 --> 28:15.352
because that's what we do, isn't it?

28:16.470 --> 28:17.513
Sure.

28:18.345 --> 28:19.553

Oh. Okay. So...

30:48.553 --> 30:51.054
I'm gonna sit here, huh? Thank you.

30:52.387 --> 30:53.892
I said 7:00.

Oh, I'm really sorry about that.

why I may have hesitated a little.

- DONALD: Good.
- Oh...

57:28.553 --> 57:30.936
Yeah, well, I dabbled in college.

57:32.512 --> 57:33.602
You should dabble some more.

Are you getting furnishing ideas?

58:04.220 --> 58:06.721
I was just thinking about
what the story is with all this stuff.

58:06.887 --> 58:07.929
Yeah.

58:08.553 --> 58:12.062
- Is that an urn?
- Hm. Yes. Mary.

Yeah.

Yeah.

- You know, it's funny.
- What?

58:27.262 --> 58:28.731
I don't think this place suits you.

This place?

58:31.053 --> 58:33.436
Oh, no, this place suits me fine.

- No, your flat, I mean.
- Oh.

You know, it feels like someone else's life.

Not yours.

Yes, it was um...

59:26.553 --> 59:28.556
I got a little cold, so...

59:30.387 --> 59:31.809
You're up to something, Mum.

What? How could I have possibly raised
such a suspicious son?

Mmm! I was on my way to a meeting.
I thought I'd swing by.

Yeah? You know, they should
feed you at these meetings.

59:49.303 --> 59:52.184
- You've been ignoring my calls, Mother.
- You ignore mine.

59:52.387 --> 59:56.220
Yes, but that's the natural order of things.

a little time with Fiona and the gang

drove it into the ground.

and then helped her run it.

copped it on immediately.

was happening, you know.

candles, at the one-pound shop.

Is that slightly used too?

that he was going to get something in return.

that he's not and he... He won't.

quite so humiliated up there.

I was humiliated.

of land in question,

01:16:44.845 --> 01:16:47.263

and asked you to leave?

- No, sir.
- Thank you.

approximately £15,000 over the last 17 years

- Would you not agree?
- I don't know what to say to that.

Your Honour, as Mr. Horner
is clearly having difficulty

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:33.314
remembering just how
he contributes to society...

01:17:33.428 --> 01:17:36.604
No, you're right, I don't contribute
to society and I don't drive.

And the relevance of that is?

01:17:40.887 --> 01:17:45.059
That means I don't take a £600 yearly
dump of carbon dioxide into the air.

add to the 7,000,000 tons of food

that costs this beautiful country,

that you're worried about, Mr. Crowley,

Thank you, Your Honour.
Please, let's stick to the point,

01:18:17.303 --> 01:18:19.851
and the point being is that a homeless man...

01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:24.272
I'm not homeless. I have a home.
I built it 17 years ago from nothing.

01:18:24.845 --> 01:18:27.855
Recycled bits and bobs,
and imagination. From nothing.

01:18:28.137 --> 01:18:29.346
Yes, but can you prove it?

01:18:30.012 --> 01:18:33.686
All of this is unsubstantiated.
There are no documents, no witnesses.

01:18:33.803 --> 01:18:36.600
Course I have no witnesses.
I go out of my way to stay out of the way.

For all of these years,
I've watched life evolve all around me.

01:18:42.553 --> 01:18:45.398
I've spent thousands of afternoons
on Parliament Hill,

01:18:45.928 --> 01:18:49.851
watching families sailing kites
so spectacular it would make you dizzy,

01:18:50.345 --> 01:18:53.391
and those same families
growing up, going away,

01:18:53.637 --> 01:18:55.272
making space for the new ones.

01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:58.603
And I have disturbed no-one.

forgive you now, I suppose.

01:31:55.137 --> 01:31:57.815
No, you're not supposed to do
anything except take the cheque.

01:31:59.928 --> 01:32:01.931
Rory would kill me if he knew
I was even talking to you.

01:32:02.303 --> 01:32:05.349
Well, maybe you might wanna apply
some of that money to counselling.

01:32:06.887 --> 01:32:08.724
- I'm sorry?
- No, I'm just saying.

01:32:09.512 --> 01:32:13.470

I mean, that's what you're choosing to do?

01:32:23.095 --> 01:32:25.137
You could say that or you could also say

01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:27.898
that I'm choosing to no longer live
a lie, and you might wanna try it.

01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:31.595

We were never really friends, Fiona, were we?

01:32:40.762 --> 01:32:44.898
I mean, I was just your project.
I was your quirky American project. Yeah.

Oh, I have absolutely no idea, none,
but I can't wait to find out.

01:32:59.345 --> 01:33:00.388
Yeah.

01:33:02.678 --> 01:33:04.930
Will you tell me one thing, Fiona?

01:33:07.595 --> 01:33:10.605
Did you know Charles was having an affair?

01:33:16.928 --> 01:33:17.971
Right.

Well, I... I might have been,
but, then again,

01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:18.053
maybe somebody just planted a rumour
to get the media off his trail.
