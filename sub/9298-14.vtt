01:00.245 --> 01:01.378
Mom?

01:01.412 --> 01:04.215
Mom!
Somebody! Help her!

01:04.250 --> 01:05.894
Mom!

01:10.226 --> 01:13.362
All right.
Fighting stance. Nice.

01:13.396 --> 01:15.831
He's coming at me.
All right?

01:15.866 --> 01:17.534
Boom! Right in the eyes.

01:17.568 --> 01:20.237
Well, that can do
serious damage to the cornea.

01:20.272 --> 01:21.672
This is my thought, yes.

01:21.707 --> 01:23.374
You know, I just --
I'd feel a little better

01:23.408 --> 01:25.710
with a j-- a-a jab, jab, hook,

01:25.744 --> 01:27.578
like I do in my boxing class.

01:27.612 --> 01:29.280
Yes, uh, you know,

01:29.314 --> 01:31.615
but by the time you've said, "jab,"

01:31.650 --> 01:34.552
the rapist has you
in the guesthouse, okay?

01:34.586 --> 01:36.453
Give it one-two, like, quick.
All right, you try.

01:36.488 --> 01:40.624
Good. Good. Good.

01:40.659 --> 01:42.294
Have you talked to your father?

01:44.231 --> 01:46.533
Why, when we're hitting a dummy,

01:46.567 --> 01:49.403
do we talk about my pop?

01:49.438 --> 01:51.406
Oh, well, you know,
we're just in the middle

01:51.440 --> 01:53.910
of self-defense training, so...

01:53.944 --> 01:55.478
Uh, no.

01:55.512 --> 01:57.815
Frankie thinks he has a girlfriend.

01:57.849 --> 01:59.283
He's still in Florida.

01:59.318 --> 02:00.452
Does your mother know?

02:00.486 --> 02:02.455
No.

02:03.491 --> 02:06.426
Here she is.
Why don't we tell her?

02:06.461 --> 02:08.929
Hey, ma. Yeah, no, I'm just
hanging out here with Maura,

02:08.964 --> 02:10.898
and she thinks you should know
about dad's new bimbo.

02:10.933 --> 02:12.333
No!
What are you doing?!

02:12.368 --> 02:13.768
I'm just kidding.
It's operations.

02:13.802 --> 02:17.339
Rizzoli. Yeah.

02:17.373 --> 02:18.674
All right.
We'll be right there.

02:18.708 --> 02:21.310
Harder.

02:21.344 --> 02:23.378
Good. Self-defense training
is over, okay?

02:23.413 --> 02:24.580
We got a murder.

02:26.212 --> 02:29.212

Sync and corrections by Gatto

02:53.249 --> 02:54.581
Mother of one of the dancers
was stabbed to death.

02:54.616 --> 02:56.384
She made it to the stage,
then collapsed.

02:56.418 --> 02:58.052
In front of all these kids?

02:58.087 --> 02:59.754
Nobody saw it happen?

02:59.789 --> 03:01.290
Nope.

03:01.324 --> 03:02.925
Have you found
the crime scene?

03:02.959 --> 03:03.926
Just following the blood.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.628
I'd like to see the body.

03:07.364 --> 03:08.665
Are you gonna get that?

03:08.699 --> 03:10.367
It's not important.

03:10.402 --> 03:11.869
I always wanted to be
a competitive dancer,

03:11.903 --> 03:13.571
but my mother was a purist.

03:13.605 --> 03:15.573
She only let me study Russian ballet.

03:15.608 --> 03:18.743
It's like
little league with sequins.

03:18.778 --> 03:21.413
Ahh.
How long you got to work out

03:21.447 --> 03:22.848
to get biceps like that
on a 10-year-old?

03:22.882 --> 03:24.850
30 to 40.

03:24.884 --> 03:26.685
Hours?!

03:26.719 --> 03:29.621
And I thought I was doing good
job working out two days a week.

03:32.525 --> 03:35.494
That is a very sharp
pair of scissors.

03:35.528 --> 03:37.096
Penetrating stab wound

03:37.130 --> 03:39.632
between the third
and fourth intercostal.

03:39.666 --> 03:41.534
Defensive wounds on her hands.

03:42.803 --> 03:45.438
"Sapphire dance studio."

03:45.473 --> 03:47.107
Everyone in the studio
has touched those scissors.

03:47.141 --> 03:48.642
Says "crime of opportunity" to me.

03:48.676 --> 03:49.910
Let's follow this blood trail.

03:56.684 --> 03:59.987
Did we have a hurricane this morning?

04:00.022 --> 04:01.990
You think this is bad,

04:02.024 --> 04:03.992
try sharing a bathroom
with two brothers.

04:04.026 --> 04:06.629
Needed a Hazmat suit
to walk in there.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.565
O-kay.
This is embarrassing.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.868
It's just a bra, Korsak.

04:11.903 --> 04:14.405
Probably more embarrassing to
the 12-year-old who left it there.

04:14.439 --> 04:16.107
Okay, we got a killer

04:16.141 --> 04:18.108
who entered and exited
a dance competition.

04:18.142 --> 04:20.744
What I want to know is,
w-why here, why now?

04:20.779 --> 04:22.479
12 dancers and their mothers
used this room.

04:22.514 --> 04:23.914
I got all the names.

04:23.948 --> 04:25.682
Who keeps calling?
Melody.

04:25.716 --> 04:27.383
She wants me to co-sign a lease

04:27.418 --> 04:29.418
to open her dream yoga studio.

04:29.453 --> 04:30.553
What, you don't want to do that?

04:30.587 --> 04:31.821
I don't want to be Melody's bank.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.689
You seen Josh yet?

04:33.723 --> 04:35.691
Melody did a number on him.

04:35.725 --> 04:36.959
He thinks I deserted him.

04:36.993 --> 04:40.129
I'm so sorry, bud.

04:40.163 --> 04:43.533
So you weren't here
when your wife was, um...

04:44.702 --> 04:46.836
I, uh, had a meeting in Revere.

04:46.870 --> 04:50.541
I'm a general contractor.

04:50.575 --> 04:51.875
There you go.

04:51.910 --> 04:54.412
Denise always texts me

04:54.446 --> 04:55.747
in time to see Dakota dance.

04:55.781 --> 04:57.048
But she, uh...

04:57.082 --> 04:59.483
She didn't this time.

04:59.518 --> 05:01.819
Can I, uh...
Can I take my daughter home now?

05:01.853 --> 05:04.822
Yeah. Yeah. We'll need
to talk to you again.

05:04.857 --> 05:06.491
All right.
Come on, hon.

05:09.794 --> 05:11.929
Girl's name is Dakota.

05:11.963 --> 05:14.031
She said her mother didn't say
anything before she died.

05:14.065 --> 05:16.934
No one saw the husband before
or immediately after the murder.

05:16.968 --> 05:19.804
Said he had a meeting in Revere.

05:19.838 --> 05:21.072
Check it. Check the GPS
on his phone, too.

05:21.106 --> 05:22.740
Make sure he's telling the truth.

05:22.775 --> 05:25.811
This is the head of the
Sapphire Dance Studio. Coach Jj?

05:25.845 --> 05:27.579
- Yeah.
- Detective Rizzoli, sergeant detective Korsak.

05:27.614 --> 05:30.850
Hey, um, how much longer do
you think this is gonna take?

05:30.884 --> 05:33.052
I've got a bunch of really upset
moms and kids.

05:33.087 --> 05:34.687
Well, how well did you know
Denise Ryan?

05:34.722 --> 05:36.657
Saw her almost every day
for three years,

05:36.691 --> 05:38.925
but actually I felt like
I didn't know her at all.

05:38.960 --> 05:40.227
She was just --

05:40.261 --> 05:42.495
she wasn't like the other dance moms.

05:42.529 --> 05:43.696
In what way?

05:43.731 --> 05:46.032
These ladies drive two hours

05:46.066 --> 05:48.033
to get to my studio
several times a week,

05:48.068 --> 05:50.903
'cause they all think that their kid
is good enough to win nationals.

05:50.937 --> 05:52.470
Only <i>Dakota is good enough to win.</i>

05:52.505 --> 05:53.771
She could win it all.

05:53.806 --> 05:56.007
But Denise would only
let her compete locally.

05:56.041 --> 05:57.675
She give you a reason?

05:57.709 --> 05:58.876
Yeah, she said
they had money problems.

05:58.910 --> 06:00.578
Maybe the dad didn't
want her competing?

06:00.612 --> 06:02.746
No, Skip was great.

06:02.781 --> 06:05.616
He'd haul our props around in
his truck. He was real friendly.

06:05.650 --> 06:07.618
She was the one
who didn't talk to anybody.

06:07.652 --> 06:09.520
Is there a video
of the dance competition?

06:09.554 --> 06:11.522
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Um, "rise to the rhythm"

06:11.556 --> 06:13.557
will be happy to sell you one
in the lobby.

06:15.927 --> 06:17.895
Rizzoli.

06:17.929 --> 06:19.530
Yes, sir.

06:19.564 --> 06:21.199
It's commander Cavanaugh.
He wants to talk to you.

06:21.233 --> 06:22.767
Sean?

06:22.801 --> 06:24.769
You don't answer
your damn phone, Vince?

06:24.803 --> 06:27.238
- I'm sorry. I thought it was Melody.
- It was.

06:27.272 --> 06:28.739
She was calling to tell you

06:28.774 --> 06:30.708
that we just picked up
your stepson, Josh.

06:30.743 --> 06:31.909
What?

06:35.881 --> 06:37.715
Oh, my God.

06:37.749 --> 06:39.116
What?

06:39.150 --> 06:41.585
They just arrested Josh
for shooting Gerry Kincaid.

06:41.619 --> 06:44.988
He shot a cop?

06:46.991 --> 06:49.926
Korsak raised Josh
from the time he was 2

06:49.961 --> 06:52.695
until Melody took him away
when he was 11.

06:52.729 --> 06:54.197
Damn. Why didn't he fight for him?

06:54.232 --> 06:55.899
He did, but he didn't have
any legal rights.

06:55.933 --> 06:57.099
And, then, Josh's deadbeat dad

06:57.134 --> 06:58.534
wouldn't give up his parental rights.

06:58.569 --> 06:59.869
He never mentions him.

06:59.903 --> 07:01.837
Yeah, well,
there's a reason for that.

07:01.871 --> 07:03.839
You want to see a grown man cry?

07:03.873 --> 07:05.707
The kid shot Gerry Kincaid, Jane.

07:05.741 --> 07:08.009
- That guy's like Santa Claus.
- I know. I know.

07:08.043 --> 07:09.176
Kincaid's in surgery.

07:09.211 --> 07:11.245
- How's it looking?
- Not good.

07:11.279 --> 07:13.280
Josh was caught coming out
of a sporting-goods store.

07:13.314 --> 07:15.815
Kincaid was walking a foot beat,
came up on him,

07:15.850 --> 07:17.684
and Josh shot him with his own gun.

07:17.718 --> 07:19.118
Oh, my God.

07:19.153 --> 07:21.054
Well, can I -- can I see him?
Can I see Josh?

07:21.088 --> 07:22.580
He says he doesn't want
to talk to anybody.

07:22.700 --> 07:23.623
I'm his father!

07:23.658 --> 07:25.398
Legally, you're not, Vince.

07:26.928 --> 07:29.597
Well, I'm getting him a lawyer.

07:29.631 --> 07:30.832
- Rizzoli, Frost.
- Sir.

07:30.866 --> 07:32.000
I'm gonna need you two
to keep focused

07:32.034 --> 07:33.868
on the dead dance mom.
You got that?

07:33.903 --> 07:36.772
Yes, sir.

07:39.876 --> 07:43.045
So, Vince, you --
you take care of your business.

07:47.250 --> 07:49.885
Vince!

07:49.919 --> 07:52.187
Why didn't you answer the phone?

07:52.222 --> 07:53.355
Because it was me calling?

07:53.389 --> 07:54.823
I needed you.

07:54.858 --> 07:57.158
You didn't take my calls
for five years.

07:57.193 --> 07:58.593
You take him away from me.

07:58.627 --> 08:00.328
You tell him I don't care about him.

08:00.362 --> 08:01.863
And now you need me?

08:01.897 --> 08:03.364
Because it's convenient for you?

08:03.399 --> 08:05.333
Vince, please.

08:05.367 --> 08:06.734
You know, he shot a cop, Melody.

08:06.768 --> 08:08.068
No! It wasn't Josh!

08:08.103 --> 08:09.669
They caught him
running from the scene

08:09.704 --> 08:11.971
with blood on his clothes
and the gun in his hand.

08:12.006 --> 08:14.106
The officer he shot
is fighting for his life.

08:14.141 --> 08:15.808
I know him.
He's a friend.

08:15.842 --> 08:18.077
I need you to go home, please.

08:18.111 --> 08:19.946
Will you go see him?
Make sure he's okay?

08:19.980 --> 08:21.147
I tried.

08:21.181 --> 08:23.082
He won't talk to me.

08:23.117 --> 08:25.084
Well, he's just scared.
H-he's --

08:25.119 --> 08:26.719
he's a minor.
He's 16!

08:26.754 --> 08:29.055
Not if Kincaid dies he's not.

08:29.090 --> 08:32.259
They will charge him as an adult
with first-degree murder.

08:36.056 --> 08:39.639
There are shots to the audience,
but it's mostly the girls dancing.

08:39.899 --> 08:40.982
I found the coach in the audience

08:41.017 --> 08:42.250
at the time of the murder,

08:42.284 --> 08:43.784
and some of the mothers,
but not all of them.

08:43.820 --> 08:45.287
What about the dad -- Skip?

08:45.322 --> 08:46.989
Not here.

08:47.023 --> 08:49.324
Skip is an odd name
for a grown man, you know?

08:49.359 --> 08:51.350
I got a friend that goes by "Swampy."

08:51.470 --> 08:52.328
Worse.

08:53.964 --> 08:56.232
Skip and Denise owned
a general-contracting company.

08:56.266 --> 08:57.934
But business wasn't too good.

08:57.968 --> 09:01.270
Tax liens, subcontractors
that haven't been paid.

09:01.305 --> 09:02.672
What about his phone records?

09:02.706 --> 09:03.940
Nothing out of the ordinary.

09:03.974 --> 09:06.843
Hold -- let me check
the GPS on Skip's phone.

09:06.877 --> 09:09.312
Yeah, didn't he say he was at a meeting
in Revere at the time of the murder?

09:10.781 --> 09:12.081
But that's not what his phone says.

09:13.383 --> 09:15.351
He was right next to that auditorium

09:15.385 --> 09:17.120
when his wife was killed.

09:17.154 --> 09:19.989
You lied to us, Skip.

09:20.024 --> 09:23.326
You were in the area when your
wife was being stabbed to death.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.394
Don't make me look at her like that.

09:25.429 --> 09:27.096
Why not? That's what she looked
like right after you killed her.

09:27.130 --> 09:29.632
I would never hurt her.
All right?

09:29.666 --> 09:32.768
She was the best wife,
the most loving mother.

09:32.803 --> 09:34.203
So, if you didn't kill her,
why did you tell us

09:34.238 --> 09:35.705
you were in Revere
at a business meeting?

09:35.739 --> 09:39.041
I was next door at the hotel bar.

09:39.076 --> 09:41.210
Drinking. Because your business
is in the toilet?

09:41.245 --> 09:43.279
- Yeah.
- Right, so, you get lit up,

09:43.313 --> 09:44.747
- you get in a fight with your wife...
- No.

09:44.782 --> 09:45.748
Stabbed her with a pair of scissors.

09:45.783 --> 09:47.083
No, I was at that bar

09:47.117 --> 09:49.919
until coach Jj called
and told me what happened.

09:49.954 --> 09:52.256
This is too easy to check, Skip.

09:52.290 --> 09:55.159
If all you were doing is having
a few beers, why lie?

09:56.428 --> 09:58.261
'Cause I'm not her real dad.

09:58.296 --> 10:00.764
But she loves me like I am,

10:00.798 --> 10:04.400
and I-I don't want her
to know I-I messed up.

10:04.434 --> 10:06.168
Is her biological father
in the picture?

10:06.203 --> 10:08.303
No, he died when Dakota was little.

10:08.338 --> 10:10.906
I-I-I met Denise when Dakota was 3,

10:10.940 --> 10:12.807
fell in love with them both.

10:12.842 --> 10:15.810
Been sober since.

10:15.844 --> 10:19.913
I don't want her to ever know
about the drinking.

10:21.817 --> 10:26.153
Well, let's hope that's the
worst thing there is to know.

10:28.323 --> 10:30.991
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:31.026 --> 10:32.326
How's sergeant Korsak?

10:32.360 --> 10:34.195
Spinning.

10:34.229 --> 10:36.063
72% of incarcerated

10:36.097 --> 10:38.032
juvenile delinquents
grew up in broken homes.

10:38.066 --> 10:39.400
What a fun fact.

10:39.434 --> 10:41.802
You should tell him that
next time you see him.

10:41.837 --> 10:42.971
Poor guy.

10:43.005 --> 10:44.472
Any update on officer Kincaid?

10:44.507 --> 10:46.708
He's out of surgery,
but it doesn't look good.

10:46.742 --> 10:49.011
He's a month away
from retirement, Maura.

10:49.045 --> 10:50.345
The whole department is just so sad

10:50.380 --> 10:51.814
that it happened to an old-timer.

10:51.848 --> 10:53.482
And how is sergeant Korsak taking it?

10:53.516 --> 10:54.783
Feels totally responsible.

10:54.818 --> 10:55.951
He shouldn't.

10:55.986 --> 10:57.253
Clinical studies indicate

10:57.287 --> 10:59.488
that good parents
can raise bad children.

10:59.523 --> 11:00.790
Hmm.

11:00.824 --> 11:03.292
- Hmm.
- She was a natural blonde.

11:03.327 --> 11:05.095
Not many blondes go brunette.

11:05.129 --> 11:07.963
Well, except for Keira Knightley
and Drew Barrymore.

11:07.998 --> 11:10.266
Have we been reading
the supermarket tabloids again?

11:10.300 --> 11:11.967
Just s-scanning the headlines.

11:12.968 --> 11:14.402
Oh, please don't repeat that.

11:14.436 --> 11:17.372
Uh, no. I'm a vault.

11:17.406 --> 11:19.974
Serious foot deformities.
Look.

11:22.144 --> 11:24.980
Oh, man!
Those are ugly-ass feet.

11:25.014 --> 11:26.848
What, was she binding them?!

11:26.883 --> 11:28.483
Wh-- it's from en pointe work,
which is a --

11:28.518 --> 11:31.187
"on point." I know. I know.

11:31.221 --> 11:33.889
Four years of forced ballet
class, thanks to my mother.

11:33.924 --> 11:35.758
You did? Russian?

11:35.792 --> 11:38.127
Well, if the teacher
is a mean, old lady

11:38.161 --> 11:40.363
who swats you in the legs with a cane

11:40.397 --> 11:41.898
if they're not straight enough, yeah.

11:41.932 --> 11:44.367
Wait. You studied
with Svetlana Alexandrov?

11:44.401 --> 11:47.236
Pretty sure her name
was Mrs. Peabody.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.239
So, what, she started point early?

11:49.273 --> 11:52.241
Uh, y-yes, before her bones
ossified sufficiently.

11:52.276 --> 11:54.310
So the mother was a serious dancer,

11:54.344 --> 11:56.245
just like her daughter, Dakota.

11:56.279 --> 11:58.314
Well, Russian en pointe is very
different than contemporary --

11:58.348 --> 12:01.016
a combination of ballet,
jazz, hip-hop.

12:01.051 --> 12:02.818
"Yes," "no."

12:02.853 --> 12:05.488
"Yes," "no."

12:05.522 --> 12:09.125
Practice with me.
"Yes." "No."

12:09.826 --> 12:12.328
<i>Yes.</i> Serious dancer.

12:12.362 --> 12:15.331
Hmm!
Well, she's pretty.

12:15.366 --> 12:18.201
Well, in an artificial sort of way.

12:18.235 --> 12:21.804
That's because she's had
extensive plastic surgery.

12:21.838 --> 12:24.140
Breast augmentation, rhinoplasty...

12:24.174 --> 12:25.875
Facial implants -- cheek and chin.

12:25.909 --> 12:27.476
Well, come -- that's just vain.

12:27.510 --> 12:28.877
Let's not judge.

12:31.080 --> 12:34.281
It's Frost.
Kincaid is back in surgery.

12:34.316 --> 12:36.017
Okay.
I got to go upstairs.

12:36.051 --> 12:37.218
He says he has something.

12:37.252 --> 12:38.386
Yep.

12:38.420 --> 12:40.254
- I'll call you later.
- All right.

12:43.525 --> 12:45.092
Checked with the bartender.

12:45.127 --> 12:46.994
Skip was at the bar the whole time.

12:47.028 --> 12:48.328
That's too bad.

12:48.363 --> 12:50.097
He was looking really good
as a suspect.

12:50.131 --> 12:52.266
Yeah. I got us two new suspects.

12:52.300 --> 12:54.502
BPD responded to a disturbance call

12:54.536 --> 12:56.870
two weeks ago
at Sapphire Dance Studio.

12:56.904 --> 12:58.071
For what?

12:58.106 --> 13:00.507
Crazy dance moms Yvonne and Kim.

13:00.542 --> 13:03.009
Both of them

13:03.043 --> 13:04.511
have daughters who compete
against Dakota --

13:04.545 --> 13:06.279
Summer and Mackenzie.

13:06.313 --> 13:09.048
And Dakota beats little Summer
and Mackenzie, doesn't she?

13:09.082 --> 13:10.849
Every time.

13:10.884 --> 13:13.218
Here's the vandalism report.

13:13.253 --> 13:15.220
Uniforms broke up a fight
between the two mothers

13:15.254 --> 13:17.556
after one of them damaged
the ether's car.

13:17.590 --> 13:20.927
Yeah. Denise's minivan was keyed.

13:20.961 --> 13:24.597
Yeah, all because Dakota
has a better, uh --

13:24.632 --> 13:27.034
what do you call this one?

13:27.068 --> 13:28.636
A plié.

13:28.670 --> 13:30.538
Yeah.

13:30.572 --> 13:32.073
What?

13:32.107 --> 13:34.375
- I-I took dance classes, too.
- Really?

13:38.247 --> 13:39.447
Yeah.

13:40.683 --> 13:42.283
Really.

13:42.317 --> 13:44.118
Okay.

13:44.152 --> 13:45.552
Ooh.

13:45.587 --> 13:48.188
I don't know. I just --
I don't get this world.

13:48.222 --> 13:50.323
I mean, it's just
a beauty pageant with rhythm.

13:50.358 --> 13:51.624
No. No, it isn't.
Come on.

13:51.659 --> 13:54.160
Dancers are athletes in costumes,

13:54.194 --> 13:56.495
you know, like...
Like ice skaters.

13:56.530 --> 13:58.464
Skaters are not athletes.

13:58.499 --> 14:01.635
Really?
And golfers <i>are?</i>

14:01.669 --> 14:03.003
Mm. Yeah.

14:03.038 --> 14:05.139
- Bowlers?
- Yeah.

14:05.174 --> 14:06.975
- NASCAR drivers?
- Yeah.

14:07.009 --> 14:09.277
And a girl with six-pack abs

14:09.312 --> 14:11.313
who can do a side leap
higher than Kobe can jump

14:11.347 --> 14:12.614
is <i>not</i> an athlete?

14:12.649 --> 14:13.949
No.

14:13.984 --> 14:16.252
Okay. Okay.

14:16.286 --> 14:17.419
Oh, man.

14:17.454 --> 14:18.921
Pay dirt.

14:18.955 --> 14:20.356
Yvonne and Kim were the only mothers

14:20.390 --> 14:23.058
from Sapphire Dance who were
not in the audience video.

14:23.093 --> 14:26.028
Look what I just found. It was
posted by another dance mom.

14:26.062 --> 14:28.397
That's our victim, Denise,
with Yvonne and Kim.

14:28.431 --> 14:30.699
<i>I said I need to talk to you,
you [Bleep] Bitch.</i>

14:30.733 --> 14:33.034
<i>Mackenzie and Summer could beat
Dakota if they cheated like you do.</i>

14:33.069 --> 14:34.703
<i>You're gonna make my
daughter cry. Please stop.</i>

14:34.737 --> 14:37.338
<i>You know how many times
Dakota has made Summer cry?</i>

14:37.373 --> 14:39.140
<i>Yeah, because Dakota beats her?!</i>

14:39.174 --> 14:41.075
<i>Maybe you should
teach her how to lose!</i>

14:41.109 --> 14:43.577
- <i>You [Bleep] Bitch!
- You know what, you bitch?!</i>

14:43.612 --> 14:46.380
<i>My daughter is gonna beat
your daughter in nationals!</i>

14:46.415 --> 14:48.249
Ouch! God!
Let's go get these two

14:48.283 --> 14:50.952
before they kill somebody else.

14:53.022 --> 14:54.990
Nice. Pull up. Pull up.

14:55.024 --> 14:58.293
What's with the arm? Come on.
Let's see some arms.

14:58.328 --> 15:00.462
Mackenzie, what's with this leg?
Pull up.

15:00.496 --> 15:02.263
Pull up!

15:02.297 --> 15:03.664
This is not summer camp.

15:06.635 --> 15:09.137
Hey! You're late!

15:09.171 --> 15:10.572
And how many times have I said,
"no booty shorts"?!

15:10.606 --> 15:13.441
Get out of my studio
until you've changed. Go.

15:13.476 --> 15:16.411
I am so sorry, coach. It won't
happen again. I promise.

15:16.445 --> 15:19.547
Booty shorts are the gateway outfit.

15:19.582 --> 15:21.116
You got to be firm with them,

15:21.150 --> 15:22.717
or they go all Britney Spears on you.

15:22.751 --> 15:24.519
Uh, what about the security guard?

15:24.553 --> 15:26.387
Got to be firm with the mothers, too.

15:26.421 --> 15:27.755
Any word on Denise?

15:27.789 --> 15:29.389
We have a few more questions for you.

15:29.423 --> 15:30.656
Oh. Okay.

15:30.691 --> 15:32.391
Just let me get my dancers warmed up.

15:32.426 --> 15:36.295
Start stretching the legs,
or I'll break them!

15:36.329 --> 15:37.530
Okay. Shoot.

15:38.766 --> 15:41.100
Uh, y-you didn't mention

15:41.134 --> 15:43.669
that some of the dance moms
hated Denise Ryan.

15:43.703 --> 15:46.639
If you were gonna investigate
every dance mom at my studio

15:46.673 --> 15:49.375
that got into a screaming match,
you'd be here 24/7.

15:49.409 --> 15:51.010
You're open 24 hours?

15:51.044 --> 15:53.412
Almost.
We go seven days a week.

15:53.446 --> 15:56.015
If you want to be a champion,
you put in the time.

15:56.049 --> 15:58.617
Tell us about Yvonne and Kim.

15:58.652 --> 16:00.486
You said it.
They hated Denise.

16:00.520 --> 16:04.356
Why? Because they were jealous
of Dakota winning everything?

16:04.391 --> 16:06.124
Sure.
But I tell you what.

16:06.159 --> 16:07.793
If they were gonna kill
anybody to stop Dakota,

16:07.827 --> 16:09.328
they'd have to kill <i>me.</i>

16:09.362 --> 16:10.562
That girl's a hard worker,

16:10.597 --> 16:12.264
and she doesn't give me any trouble,

16:12.298 --> 16:14.366
not like some of these
other ones. Hey!

16:14.400 --> 16:16.235
Excuse me.

16:16.269 --> 16:18.237
You two just lost
your duet high-golds.

16:18.271 --> 16:21.440
I want those trophies tomorrow.
Now, warm up!

16:21.475 --> 16:23.442
Move!

16:23.476 --> 16:25.711
Oh, Dakota's here.

16:25.745 --> 16:27.746
How's she holding up?

16:27.780 --> 16:29.615
She wanted to dance.

16:29.649 --> 16:32.785
Well, that's good. You know,
keep her in her routine.

16:32.819 --> 16:34.653
I'm putting work on hold.

16:34.688 --> 16:36.522
I'm not letting her out of my sight.

16:36.556 --> 16:38.324
You don't think someone here
did it, do you?

16:38.358 --> 16:40.225
We're looking at everybody.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.694
I think we should bring those
two in for a little chat.

16:53.794 --> 16:57.130
I'm not gonna lie.
Denise was poison.

16:57.164 --> 16:58.765
And her kid was mean, too.

16:58.799 --> 17:00.799
You know, Dakota dropped Summer

17:00.834 --> 17:02.601
in a lift at
the Sparkles competition.

17:02.636 --> 17:04.704
- And you think it was deliberate?
- Hell, yes.

17:04.739 --> 17:06.673
Was it deliberate
when Tonya Harding tried

17:06.708 --> 17:08.208
to take out Nancy Kerrigan?

17:08.242 --> 17:10.478
I think so. That cost Summer
an elite spot.

17:10.512 --> 17:12.714
Where were you yesterday
at 3:00 P.M.?

17:12.748 --> 17:15.183
Uh, well, I wasn't in the
dressing room, stabbing Denise,

17:15.217 --> 17:16.451
if that's what you're asking.

17:16.484 --> 17:17.752
I was in the audience.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.387
We checked the video.
Didn't see you.

17:20.423 --> 17:23.290
I bought a pass to tape Summer
from the video platform.

17:23.326 --> 17:25.292
I get sick of seeing the other kids

17:25.327 --> 17:26.728
in the group's numbers, so...

17:26.762 --> 17:30.531
The competition runs a recording
from the platform.

17:30.566 --> 17:32.333
Parents pay the 30 bucks.

17:37.138 --> 17:39.272
That's Yvonne.
Right there.

17:39.306 --> 17:40.606
So she was telling the truth.

17:40.641 --> 17:42.208
Oh, hey.

17:48.281 --> 17:49.782
Oh, come on, man.

17:51.818 --> 17:53.219
Damn, that's cold.

17:54.754 --> 17:56.155
Korsak, don't worry about it.

17:56.189 --> 17:57.823
I haven't even seen Josh
in five years.

17:57.858 --> 17:59.691
But I don't blame them
for looking at me

17:59.726 --> 18:01.694
like it's my fault.

18:04.430 --> 18:06.865
I wish there was something
we could do for Korsak.

18:06.899 --> 18:08.600
Yeah, me too.

18:08.634 --> 18:11.669
There was a time when
I could have gone either way,

18:11.703 --> 18:13.504
when my dad wasn't around.

18:13.538 --> 18:15.606
I just think that Josh should
know that Korsak wanted him.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.474
I know.

18:17.509 --> 18:19.143
Come on.

18:19.177 --> 18:21.478
Let's go shake up dance mom Kim.

18:21.513 --> 18:23.580
Where was <i>she</i> when Denise
was bleeding out?

18:23.614 --> 18:26.583
Yeah.
I keyed Denise's car.

18:26.618 --> 18:28.519
Only on the passenger door.

18:28.553 --> 18:30.187
Look, I'm pretty sure

18:30.222 --> 18:31.856
that Dakota took one
of Mackenzie's jazz shoes.

18:31.890 --> 18:35.427
I'm surprised you didn't go
after the driver's door, too.

18:35.461 --> 18:38.430
That's not why I lost my temper.

18:38.464 --> 18:40.299
We're listening.

18:40.334 --> 18:42.368
Denise lied about Dakota's age.
I'm sure of it.

18:42.402 --> 18:43.836
I'm the team mom, so I'm in charge

18:43.871 --> 18:46.239
of the girls' registration materials.

18:46.273 --> 18:47.607
Denise never gave me

18:47.641 --> 18:49.609
the original birth certificate
for Dakota.

18:49.644 --> 18:52.312
So, you think Denise doctored this

18:52.346 --> 18:54.814
so Dakota could compete
against younger girls?

18:54.848 --> 18:56.583
Yeah. I sure do.

18:56.617 --> 18:58.818
Look, if you want to win at
all costs, you'll do anything.

18:58.852 --> 19:00.853
Keep that. That's what
you should be investigating.

19:00.888 --> 19:03.556
We have video footage of the
audience. You're not in it.

19:03.590 --> 19:06.392
Oh, I was buying dance videos
for the team.

19:07.729 --> 19:09.663
It's time-stamped.
Wow.

19:09.697 --> 19:12.332
You -- you came with
your own case file.

19:12.367 --> 19:14.401
Well, I didn't think you asked
me to come here for coffee.

19:15.770 --> 19:17.371
Did you kill Denise Ryan?

19:17.405 --> 19:20.941
No. I didn't like her.
But I didn't kill her.

19:33.654 --> 19:35.288
You okay?

19:36.824 --> 19:39.492
Do I look okay?

19:39.526 --> 19:41.428
What, you come in here
to get your licks in, too?

19:41.462 --> 19:43.229
Josh.

19:43.264 --> 19:45.232
Why are you here?

19:45.266 --> 19:47.434
I told my mom I didn't
want to talk to you.

19:47.468 --> 19:48.769
Your mother and I divorced,

19:48.804 --> 19:50.871
but I never stopped
being your father.

19:50.906 --> 19:54.875
Oh, yeah. "Dad."

19:54.909 --> 19:56.677
It was -- it was a blast

19:56.712 --> 19:59.580
hanging out with you
the last couple years --

19:59.614 --> 20:03.917
on the weekends,
the summer vacations...

20:03.951 --> 20:06.686
Field trips, ballgames.

20:06.721 --> 20:09.589
H-how did you find all that time?

20:09.624 --> 20:13.961
I called. I wrote.
I sent birthday presents.

20:13.995 --> 20:16.564
You're a liar, Vince.

20:16.598 --> 20:19.300
Cut the tough-guy bullshit.

20:20.769 --> 20:22.603
I know you're hurt.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.304
And I know you're angry.

20:24.339 --> 20:25.973
I wasn't there for you.

20:26.008 --> 20:28.675
Not because I didn't want to be.

20:28.710 --> 20:30.544
But I'm here now.

20:30.579 --> 20:33.247
I don't need you now.

20:33.282 --> 20:35.016
- I'm fine.
- The hell you are.

20:35.050 --> 20:38.719
You're accused of shooting a cop.

20:38.754 --> 20:40.521
I want to know, did you?

20:40.555 --> 20:42.690
Did you do that, Josh?

20:42.724 --> 20:45.426
Because the boy
I knew and loved couldn't.

20:45.460 --> 20:47.428
I want this guy out of here,
and I want a lawyer.

20:47.463 --> 20:49.631
I got a great lawyer,
someone who can help you.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.032
No, I want a public defender.

20:51.067 --> 20:53.736
You don't owe me anything, Vince.

20:53.770 --> 20:55.304
Bye-bye.

21:04.681 --> 21:07.749
So, who wanted
Denise Ryan dead?

21:07.784 --> 21:10.919
I'm coming up empty. I mean,
she had no friends, no job.

21:10.953 --> 21:13.988
All she did was take Dakota
to school and to dance.

21:14.022 --> 21:17.758
And home with Skippy,
who has an alibi.

21:17.793 --> 21:20.594
I dug around in Denise's life
to see if we missed somebody.

21:20.629 --> 21:23.064
Guess what. Denise Ryan didn't
have a single credit card.

21:23.098 --> 21:24.933
Well, they were having
money problems.

21:24.967 --> 21:26.902
No, I mean, like,
no credit history...

21:26.936 --> 21:29.071
- At all.
- That <i>is</i> weird.

21:29.105 --> 21:30.940
Who makes it to age 35
with no credit?

21:30.974 --> 21:32.608
Did you run her social?

21:32.642 --> 21:35.478
Yeah. It's good. Found
a passport, driver's license.

21:35.513 --> 21:36.880
What's Korsak doing in crib?

21:39.851 --> 21:41.685
Cavanaugh said he talked to Josh.

21:41.719 --> 21:43.420
How'd it go?

21:43.454 --> 21:44.721
Afraid to ask.

21:55.898 --> 21:57.398
Nobody blames you.

21:57.433 --> 21:59.467
Josh does.

22:00.836 --> 22:03.437
Oh, that was on castle island.
The blues were running.

22:03.472 --> 22:06.074
Oh.
He loved the boat.

22:06.108 --> 22:09.444
Why did she take him away, Korsak?

22:09.479 --> 22:11.780
I was working a lot.

22:11.814 --> 22:15.117
I didn't realize how needy
she was until it was over.

22:15.151 --> 22:18.821
I think she was drinking.
She was lonely.

22:18.856 --> 22:21.357
She reached out to Josh's bio dad.

22:21.392 --> 22:24.026
He led her on, encouraged her
to move to Florida.

22:24.061 --> 22:26.062
That's crap.

22:26.096 --> 22:29.098
She thought it would be good for
Josh to get to know his real father.

22:29.132 --> 22:31.500
What? <i>You</i> were his real father.

22:31.534 --> 22:34.502
Cavanaugh slip you this?

22:34.537 --> 22:37.004
Josh's prints are all over the gun.

22:37.039 --> 22:39.540
Crime lab matched the blood
on his clothes to Gerry Kincaid.

22:39.574 --> 22:42.042
Between the prints and
the blood, it's open-and-shut.

22:42.076 --> 22:43.743
No, Vince, it's not.

22:43.778 --> 22:45.778
There's a second set
of prints on the gun.

22:45.813 --> 22:46.946
What?

22:46.980 --> 22:48.781
Yeah.

22:48.816 --> 22:51.051
Gavin Thompson, 17.

22:51.085 --> 22:53.153
Josh had a friend with that
name. I never liked that kid.

22:53.187 --> 22:54.621
Well, yeah, look at his record --

22:54.655 --> 22:56.489
B&E, robbery, assault.

22:56.524 --> 22:58.025
I want to bring
this Gavin Thompson in.

22:58.059 --> 22:59.726
I already assigned a team
to pick him up,

22:59.760 --> 23:01.128
but I'll keep you in the loop.

23:01.162 --> 23:02.629
Okay, look, if you need me,

23:02.664 --> 23:04.065
I'll be in the building, all right?

23:04.099 --> 23:05.466
Maura's found something new
on our dance mom.

23:05.500 --> 23:08.002
- Sir.
- Okay.

23:08.036 --> 23:10.004
What do you got?

23:10.039 --> 23:12.007
Her plastic surgery
is much more extensive

23:12.041 --> 23:13.609
than I initially realized.

23:20.570 --> 23:22.152
She get a boob job on her wrist?

23:22.187 --> 23:24.688
I mean, I don't have an M.D.
Or anything,

23:24.722 --> 23:26.557
but I'm fairly confident
those are fingers.

23:26.591 --> 23:28.091
I x-rayed her skeleton to make sure

23:28.125 --> 23:29.693
I hadn't missed any surgeries.

23:29.728 --> 23:31.929
And I found evidence
of repetitive spiral fractures

23:31.964 --> 23:34.098
to both of her wrists --
at least three.

23:34.132 --> 23:36.801
- So she's a battered spouse.
- Perhaps.

23:36.835 --> 23:38.503
But spiral fractures

23:38.537 --> 23:40.704
are also a common skiing injury
in the lower leg

23:40.738 --> 23:42.573
due to the inflexibility
of a boot in a fall.

23:42.607 --> 23:45.542
Maura, I don't think she's doing
handstands in her ski boots.

23:45.576 --> 23:47.044
Probably not.

23:47.078 --> 23:49.879
So, how old are these fractures?

23:49.914 --> 23:52.048
Well, uh, they are
at least a decade old.

23:53.584 --> 23:55.551
Well, so that means it wasn't Skip.

23:55.586 --> 23:57.887
Maybe it was Dakota's
biological father.

23:57.921 --> 24:00.055
I'm starting to think
that Denise Ryan

24:00.090 --> 24:02.144
wasn't just a suburban dance mom.

24:10.657 --> 24:12.325
Nothing.

24:12.359 --> 24:14.661
Did a nationwide search,
all 50 States.

24:14.696 --> 24:17.564
Well, Denise fractured
both her wrists three times.

24:17.599 --> 24:20.434
And Maura's certain that the bones
were set each time by a doctor.

24:20.469 --> 24:23.437
W-- there has to be medical records.

24:23.471 --> 24:25.606
I checked her full name --
Denise Burke Ryan.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.607
Didn't come up
on any hospital records.

24:27.642 --> 24:30.477
What about when Dakota was born?

24:30.511 --> 24:32.345
Birth certificate
lists Florida General.

24:35.615 --> 24:37.182
This is weird.

24:37.217 --> 24:39.551
There's no record
of a Dakota Ryan's birth.

24:39.586 --> 24:42.721
Okay.
The father's deceased.

24:42.755 --> 24:45.257
There's a name here.
Xavier R. White.

24:45.291 --> 24:48.127
Check NCIC, also look
for domestic-abuse reports

24:48.161 --> 24:49.628
or restraining orders against him.

24:49.663 --> 24:51.564
No hits.

24:51.598 --> 24:53.433
Nothing?

24:56.304 --> 24:58.139
There's no death certificate.

24:58.173 --> 25:01.810
Well, the <i>lack</i> of information
is telling me something.

25:01.844 --> 25:03.345
- Like what?
- Well, think about it.

25:03.379 --> 25:05.347
Denise had extensive plastic surgery.

25:05.381 --> 25:07.048
This is way beyond vain.

25:07.083 --> 25:08.617
She didn't <i>wa</i> anyone to recognize her.

25:08.651 --> 25:10.419
And we can't find anything that says

25:10.454 --> 25:12.088
she existed before 10 years ago.

25:12.122 --> 25:14.657
Yeah. That says she might
be in Witsec, right?

25:14.692 --> 25:16.360
Witness protection program.
Yeah.

25:16.394 --> 25:17.628
Yeah. Pieces all fit.

25:17.662 --> 25:19.830
I'll call the U.S. Marshals office.

25:19.864 --> 25:22.699
They're not gonna tell you anything.
I've been through this before.

25:24.435 --> 25:25.736
So, what do we do?

25:25.770 --> 25:28.072
Come on.

25:28.106 --> 25:31.141
Perfect baseball stitch.

25:31.176 --> 25:33.143
Uniform length.

25:33.177 --> 25:35.078
Knots on the inside.

25:35.112 --> 25:37.581
Sorry to interrupt
your little crafts project,

25:37.615 --> 25:39.349
but we need your help with something.

25:39.384 --> 25:41.084
You think you can help us re-create

25:41.119 --> 25:42.619
what she looked like before surgery?

25:42.654 --> 25:47.157
Sure. Sure. Can you
hand me that scalpel?

25:47.191 --> 25:48.392
Thanks.

25:53.223 --> 25:54.565
Uh, what are you doing?

25:54.599 --> 25:56.467
Peeling off her face.

25:56.501 --> 25:58.469
She -- she did not just say that.

25:58.503 --> 26:01.405
We were hoping that you could
do it on the <i>computer.</i>

26:01.439 --> 26:03.107
Oh.

26:03.141 --> 26:05.109
Well, I suppose we could do that,

26:05.143 --> 26:07.110
but it's certainly not as hands-on.

26:07.145 --> 26:09.613
They picked up Gavin Thompson.
Punk was riding a skateboard

26:09.647 --> 26:11.214
stolen from the sporting-goods store.

26:11.249 --> 26:12.549
Cavanaugh's getting ready

26:12.583 --> 26:13.583
to interrogate him.
I'm gonna watch it.

26:13.618 --> 26:15.185
- I'm gonna go with you.
- Why?

26:15.220 --> 26:17.755
To keep you out of handcuffs.

26:17.789 --> 26:20.790
I'm not going away for killing a cop.

26:20.825 --> 26:22.326
I had nothing to do with it.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.727
Bullshit, kid.

26:24.762 --> 26:26.663
We got your prints on the gun,

26:26.697 --> 26:28.698
and we got your buddy Josh in there

26:28.732 --> 26:30.266
<i>telling us the whole story.</i>

26:30.301 --> 26:32.168
- What did Josh say?
- Nothing.

26:32.203 --> 26:34.170
Cavanaugh's got to try to play
them one off against the other.

26:34.205 --> 26:36.673
<i>How do you explain having
your prints on a cop's gun?</i>

26:36.707 --> 26:38.341
I did the break-in.

26:38.376 --> 26:39.609
As for all that other mess
<i>that went down...</i>

26:39.644 --> 26:40.810
<i>What did Josh say?</i>

26:40.845 --> 26:44.513
Look...

26:44.548 --> 26:47.216
You know how this works.
First up, best dressed.

26:47.251 --> 26:48.885
You talk...

26:48.919 --> 26:51.621
- <i>And I might be able to help you out.
- God, don't.</i>

26:51.655 --> 26:54.256
Josh got the same chance as
this kid. He didn't take it.

26:55.425 --> 26:58.261
I was behind Josh when we came
out of the back of the store.

26:58.295 --> 26:59.862
That cop came from out of nowhere.

26:59.897 --> 27:02.265
He was an old guy, so Josh
got the gun away from him.

27:02.299 --> 27:03.833
Then how'd your prints get on it?

27:03.867 --> 27:07.537
The cop was on the ground.
Josh pointed the gun at him.

27:07.571 --> 27:09.705
<i>I grabbed the gun, tried to stop him.</i>

27:09.739 --> 27:11.908
<i>But he just pulled the trigger.</i>

27:11.942 --> 27:13.510
<i>Shot him.</i>

27:13.544 --> 27:15.678
<i>He hates cops.</i>

27:15.713 --> 27:17.814
<i>This guy who married his mom
was a cop.</i>

27:19.550 --> 27:22.552
Damn it.

27:22.586 --> 27:24.421
Josh is gonna tell me
what the hell happened!

27:24.455 --> 27:26.622
Not now, all right?
Not while you're this angry.

27:26.657 --> 27:28.524
Anger's the only thing I got anymore.

27:34.964 --> 27:37.798
I can do this alone.

27:37.833 --> 27:41.435
I know you can.
I just don't want you to.

27:45.975 --> 27:48.844
Leave him cuffed.

27:56.019 --> 27:57.787
What?

27:59.923 --> 28:01.524
You see this man?

28:01.559 --> 28:03.893
He's fighting for his life right now.

28:03.927 --> 28:08.230
And his four kids and his wife
are crying their eyes out.

28:08.265 --> 28:09.932
Don't look away from me.

28:11.534 --> 28:13.534
Your buddy Gavin just gave you up.

28:15.938 --> 28:17.772
Nice try, Vince.

28:17.806 --> 28:19.306
Gavin's been my friend

28:19.341 --> 28:21.475
longer than you pretended
to be my dad.

28:22.944 --> 28:25.012
You might want to see this.

28:27.783 --> 28:30.619
<i>The cop was on the ground.
Josh pointed the gun at him.</i>

28:30.654 --> 28:34.457
<i>I grabbed the gun, tried to stop him.</i>

28:34.491 --> 28:37.293
But he just pulled the trigger.
<i>Shot him.</i>

28:37.328 --> 28:38.928
What do you have to say
about that, Josh?

28:41.365 --> 28:42.832
Go to hell.

28:42.867 --> 28:45.635
What the hell
is wrong with you?

28:45.669 --> 28:48.804
Do you understand
that if this officer dies,

28:48.839 --> 28:51.640
you're going to prison
for the rest of your life?

28:53.042 --> 28:55.577
Say something.

28:58.446 --> 29:00.881
Damn it.
Say <i>something.</i>

29:02.983 --> 29:05.785
Vince! Vince!
No! Vince!

29:05.820 --> 29:08.755
Stop it! Stop it.

29:15.810 --> 29:18.126
Hi.

29:18.246 --> 29:22.617
I found this stevia
in the health-food store.

29:22.651 --> 29:23.651
Thank you.
Just how you like it.

29:23.686 --> 29:27.156
I have a son who's, uh...

29:27.190 --> 29:29.725
- Been in some trouble.
- You do?

29:29.760 --> 29:32.562
I mean, he didn't shoot anybody
or anything.

29:32.596 --> 29:33.763
But he ran over a priest.

29:33.797 --> 29:35.164
Oh, my God.

29:35.199 --> 29:37.867
Father Crowley's been
really good about it,

29:37.901 --> 29:39.735
and Tommy feels terrible.

29:39.770 --> 29:42.604
He did time.
It was three years.

29:42.639 --> 29:44.840
So I know exactly
what you're feeling.

29:44.874 --> 29:48.176
I feel like living the last five
years of my life over again.

29:48.210 --> 29:50.578
I took Josh away from the only man

29:50.612 --> 29:52.679
who ever gave a damn about him.

29:55.116 --> 29:59.654
I better go.
I'm gonna soak some pots.

30:05.929 --> 30:10.233
I could say "I'm sorry" every
day for the rest of my life.

30:10.267 --> 30:13.103
But it still wouldn't be enough.

30:13.137 --> 30:15.272
I don't know who that kid is.

30:15.306 --> 30:18.275
When we left you, he --

30:18.310 --> 30:21.645
when <i>I</i> left you...

30:21.680 --> 30:24.849
Josh asked about you every day.

30:24.884 --> 30:27.018
"Where's dad?"

30:27.053 --> 30:30.156
"Why didn't dad come with us?"

30:30.190 --> 30:31.958
What'd you say?

30:31.992 --> 30:34.994
That you were in love
with your job, not us.

30:37.632 --> 30:40.200
That you weren't ever coming for us.

30:42.837 --> 30:45.705
He loves you, Vince.

30:45.740 --> 30:50.144
No matter what he tells you,
he loves you.

30:54.082 --> 30:56.050
Is that what Denise
would have looked like

30:56.084 --> 30:57.718
without all that plastic surgery?

30:57.752 --> 31:01.288
Yes. I'm focusing on federal
criminal trials in 2000.

31:01.323 --> 31:04.025
Detective Frost is looking at 2001.

31:04.059 --> 31:06.561
It's a big search.
She wanted to help.

31:06.595 --> 31:08.029
We're hoping to get a hit
on facial recognition.

31:08.063 --> 31:10.565
On any database we might
be able to find a photograph

31:10.599 --> 31:12.767
of a woman who testified
in a high-profile trial.

31:12.801 --> 31:14.669
Listen to you, Columbo.

31:16.271 --> 31:18.939
Oh, my goodness!

31:18.973 --> 31:21.641
Detective Frost, did I do it?

31:21.676 --> 31:23.977
I think you did.

31:25.747 --> 31:28.582
Denise's real name was Debbie Brown.

31:28.616 --> 31:30.250
Her husband was
a Miami drug trafficker.

31:30.285 --> 31:33.120
- Roberto Gusano. Mexican national.
- Typical fed tactic --

31:33.155 --> 31:35.256
they charged Denise with
conspiracy to violate drug laws

31:35.290 --> 31:37.292
to get her to testify
against her husband.

31:37.326 --> 31:40.595
Gusano got a 10-year sentence,
and he still fought for custody.

31:40.629 --> 31:42.163
That's why Denise wouldn't give up

31:42.198 --> 31:44.599
Dakota's real birth certificate
to dance mom Kim.

31:44.633 --> 31:48.102
Yeah, I bet she doctored it --
birth date and father's name --

31:48.137 --> 31:50.004
so Dakota would be harder to find.

31:50.039 --> 31:52.240
- Witsec won't forge documents, right?
- That's right.

31:52.274 --> 31:54.776
You can change your name,
but not your birth date.

31:54.811 --> 31:56.645
Ah. Poor Denise.

31:56.679 --> 31:58.914
She had to leave everything
behind, her friends, her family.

31:58.948 --> 32:00.882
Hide from Gusano
for the rest of her life.

32:00.917 --> 32:02.183
Where's Gusano being held?

32:03.718 --> 32:05.053
Super-max penitentiary in Colorado.

32:05.087 --> 32:07.221
He looks very mean.

32:07.256 --> 32:09.390
- I'm calling the U.S. Marshals.
- I thought you said they wouldn't help.

32:09.425 --> 32:12.293
They don't have a choice
now that we have a name.

32:12.327 --> 32:14.996
I was assigned to oversee
Denise Ryan's relocation

32:15.030 --> 32:16.864
from Florida to Boston.

32:16.899 --> 32:18.733
I check in with her once a month.

32:18.767 --> 32:20.835
Well, how come we didn't hear
from you when she was murdered?

32:20.869 --> 32:22.136
There was nothing we could do.

32:22.171 --> 32:24.072
Your agency was already
investigating.

32:24.106 --> 32:27.275
We think Roberto Gusano may have
called a hit on Denise from prison.

32:27.309 --> 32:29.977
I am not at liberty to tell you
how I know,

32:30.012 --> 32:33.314
but I know that didn't happen.

32:33.348 --> 32:35.049
That's Gusano's
daughter, isn't it?

32:35.083 --> 32:37.852
I'm sorry. There really
isn't much I can tell you.

32:37.887 --> 32:39.087
Why are you protecting Gusano?

32:39.121 --> 32:41.190
Again, I am not at liberty to say.

32:41.224 --> 32:44.026
Prison records say Gusano's
in super-max in Colorado.

32:44.061 --> 32:46.195
But you guys at
the justice department

32:46.229 --> 32:48.198
control federal prison records.

32:48.232 --> 32:50.232
Gusano's a government witness,
isn't he?

32:51.933 --> 32:54.236
- Damn. You think he's in Witsec?
- Yeah, I do.

32:54.271 --> 32:55.772
That's right, isn't it?

32:55.806 --> 32:57.440
Where's Gusano now?

32:57.474 --> 32:59.975
I honestly don't know, detective.

33:01.778 --> 33:03.412
Are those photos of Denise?

33:03.446 --> 33:06.214
Yes.
Denise grew up in Florida.

33:06.249 --> 33:08.750
Danced with several
professional companies.

33:08.785 --> 33:11.420
She met Gusano when she
was visiting her sister.

33:11.454 --> 33:12.988
They look close.

33:13.023 --> 33:14.823
Inseparable,
according to Denise.

33:14.857 --> 33:15.991
What's her sister's name?

33:16.025 --> 33:17.759
Her name was Gabrielle Radford.

33:17.793 --> 33:21.763
"Was"? I'm assuming
she's not dead, so, wh--

33:21.797 --> 33:23.197
she's in Witsec, too?

33:26.935 --> 33:29.403
You wouldn't tell me where
Gabrielle was even if you knew.

33:29.437 --> 33:31.772
Well, the rules of Witsec are hard,

33:31.807 --> 33:34.442
but it's the only way we know
how to keep people safe.

33:36.011 --> 33:38.746
Please let me know
when you find her killer.

33:40.048 --> 33:41.349
Whitmore.

33:41.383 --> 33:44.219
The rules of Witsec --

33:44.253 --> 33:47.756
never speak to friends or family
from the past <i>ever.</i>

33:47.790 --> 33:48.991
What are you thinking?

33:49.025 --> 33:51.960
Well, no one can do that.

33:54.130 --> 33:56.965
I'm gonna say something,

33:56.999 --> 33:59.834
even if you don't want to hear it.

33:59.868 --> 34:03.070
You're my son, and I love you.

34:03.105 --> 34:07.375
And even if you did this,
I won't abandon you.

34:07.410 --> 34:09.944
Do you hear me?

34:11.913 --> 34:13.246
Yeah.

34:15.116 --> 34:18.085
- You really tried to call?
- Yes.

34:18.119 --> 34:19.753
You sent letters?

34:19.788 --> 34:22.255
Almost every day,
for a long time, Josh.

34:22.291 --> 34:25.860
Dad...
I didn't do it.

34:25.893 --> 34:28.529
What? Talk to me, Josh.
Tell me everything.

34:28.563 --> 34:30.063
Gavin's lying.

34:30.098 --> 34:31.799
H-he's the one who shot the cop.

34:31.833 --> 34:33.833
I tried to wrestle the gun
away from <i>him.</i>

34:33.869 --> 34:35.036
Why didn't you tell me?

34:35.070 --> 34:36.838
I thought he was my friend.

34:36.871 --> 34:38.306
I-I c-couldn't believe

34:38.340 --> 34:40.041
that you thought
that I would do that.

34:40.074 --> 34:43.210
Lawyer told me not to talk to anyone.

34:43.245 --> 34:45.545
How did you get officer
Kincaid's blood all over you?

34:45.580 --> 34:47.081
I tried to help him.

34:47.114 --> 34:48.949
I tried to give him CPR,

34:48.984 --> 34:51.351
just like you taught me
when I was a kid.

34:53.054 --> 34:55.188
When I heard the sirens...

34:55.223 --> 34:59.893
I knew I was in big trouble...

34:59.928 --> 35:01.495
So I took off.

35:01.530 --> 35:05.533
I'm gonna get you out of here, Josh.

35:07.536 --> 35:11.206
It's Gavin's word against Josh,
and Gavin talked first.

35:11.240 --> 35:12.908
E.M.S. Report says Kincaid

35:12.942 --> 35:15.243
was breathing on his own
when they arrived.

35:15.277 --> 35:19.114
Well, they have to note it
if CPR was administered.

35:19.148 --> 35:21.816
You see that box?
The paramedic checked "no."

35:23.519 --> 35:27.355
That should be officer Kincaid's
chest x-rays from the E.R.

35:27.390 --> 35:29.223
You see these lines,

35:29.258 --> 35:31.826
where the rib 1 and 2
connect to the sternum?

35:31.860 --> 35:34.028
- Yes.
- They're fractures.

35:34.063 --> 35:36.530
The force exerted to the chest
during CPR

35:36.565 --> 35:38.098
sometimes can result in broken ribs.

35:38.133 --> 35:39.533
It's the only explanation

35:39.568 --> 35:41.835
for Gerry Kincaid's injured ribs.

35:41.869 --> 35:43.503
It's not enough.

35:43.538 --> 35:45.939
The only one who can confirm
that Josh tried to help is Kincaid,

35:45.974 --> 35:47.441
and he's still not conscious.

35:47.475 --> 35:49.309
Well, I think you need
to be prepared.

35:49.344 --> 35:51.077
He may never regain consciousness.

36:02.999 --> 36:06.225
But the forensic proof
may be right here.

36:06.259 --> 36:07.926
On Josh's clothes?

36:07.960 --> 36:12.397
There's a higher concentration
of blood at the knee...

36:12.431 --> 36:14.465
And here on the toes
of Josh's sneakers.

36:14.500 --> 36:17.035
So you're saying the clothes prove that
Josh was kneeling over Kincaid's body.

36:17.070 --> 36:20.372
Giving him CPR.
But I'm not saying anything.

36:20.407 --> 36:22.341
The clothes are.
The evidence is.

36:22.376 --> 36:25.011
My son is telling the truth.

36:26.492 --> 36:28.387
Denise and Gabrielle
were both dancers but ...

36:28.507 --> 36:30.534
M-maybe they tried to talk
to each other in chat rooms.

36:30.654 --> 36:33.649
How many dance websites <i>are</i> there?

36:33.683 --> 36:35.217
Here's Denise's e-mail address.

36:35.251 --> 36:37.986
What's "a bunhead"?

36:38.021 --> 36:39.221
A ballerina.

36:39.255 --> 36:40.622
Hmm.

36:40.656 --> 36:42.190
Well
Denise wouldn't want

36:42.225 --> 36:44.125
to get kicked out of Witsec,
you know?

36:44.160 --> 36:45.860
I mean, she'd be almost as afraid

36:45.895 --> 36:47.862
of the government
as she'd be of Gusano.

36:47.896 --> 36:49.663
Terrorists figured out
a pretty smart way

36:49.698 --> 36:51.098
to get around government monitoring.

36:51.132 --> 36:53.700
They write the e-mail
but don't send it.

36:53.735 --> 36:55.803
I'm not following you.

36:55.837 --> 36:57.505
Yep. Here it is.

36:57.539 --> 36:58.873
Denise has a bunch of unsent mail.

36:58.907 --> 37:00.741
Basically, you give
your password to someone.

37:00.775 --> 37:03.477
They access the account remotely
and read the unsent mail.

37:03.512 --> 37:05.479
Gabrielle and Denise <i>were</i> in touch.

37:05.514 --> 37:08.983
"Gabs, Dakota is on fire.
You have to see my baby dance.

37:09.018 --> 37:12.153
"Saturday at the Tourraine  hotel
and convention center.

37:12.187 --> 37:14.889
Please? It has to be safe now."

37:14.924 --> 37:17.225
Here's the I.P. Address
that accessed the account remotely.

37:17.260 --> 37:19.594
Belongs to Gabrielle Bronson.

37:19.629 --> 37:21.029
Westboro, Mass.

37:21.064 --> 37:22.731
Sisters lived 30 minutes
from each other.

37:22.766 --> 37:25.000
Come on.
Let's go talk to Gabrielle.

37:41.184 --> 37:44.019
She's been tortured.

37:44.054 --> 37:46.622
Well, I think we know
how Gusano found Denise.

37:46.656 --> 37:48.757
U.S. Marshals! Freeze!
Oh! Boston police!

37:48.792 --> 37:51.627
- Stand down.
- Maybe you want to tell me again

37:51.661 --> 37:53.796
how you think Gusano had
nothing to do with this?

37:53.830 --> 37:54.997
Honest to God, I didn't think he did.

37:55.031 --> 37:56.798
Wait a minute.
I-I'm curious.

37:56.833 --> 37:58.133
What are you doing here if you
didn't know where she was?

37:58.167 --> 38:00.135
I didn't know she left Witsec.

38:00.169 --> 38:01.770
After talking to you,
I talked to my superior.

38:01.804 --> 38:03.605
I thought we should look in on her.

38:03.639 --> 38:05.807
And you <i>still</i> think Gusano
had nothing to do with this?

38:05.841 --> 38:07.041
I want to know where he is.

38:07.076 --> 38:09.043
We put him in Rapid City.

38:09.078 --> 38:10.745
His case officer
thought he was there,

38:10.779 --> 38:12.680
but he slipped away somehow.

38:12.714 --> 38:14.782
They gave him early release
after he agreed

38:14.816 --> 38:16.651
to testify against the Diaz cartel.

38:16.685 --> 38:18.319
He's not gonna testify.

38:18.353 --> 38:20.722
He's going back to Mexico, and
he's taking Dakota with him.

38:27.798 --> 38:30.934
Where's Dakota?

38:30.968 --> 38:33.570
She's about to perform.
Why? What's wrong?

38:36.874 --> 38:41.010
♪ My heart lifts off the ground ♪

38:41.044 --> 38:43.712
Okay, where's Dakota?
She's supposed to be in this.

38:43.746 --> 38:46.214
You take stage right,
I got stage left.

38:46.248 --> 38:48.816
♪ Never knowing
which way we're going ♪

38:48.851 --> 38:52.687
♪ baby, get me from the cold,
I'm frozen ♪

38:52.721 --> 38:54.689
Where's Dakota? Where's Dakota?
Have you seen her?

38:54.723 --> 38:56.190
I don't know.
I haven't seen her.

38:56.225 --> 38:58.727
Please! Let me go!

38:58.761 --> 39:01.096
What's going on?

39:04.668 --> 39:06.269
Gusano, let her go!

39:06.303 --> 39:07.937
Please!

39:07.972 --> 39:10.907
It's okay, honey. Come on.
Everything's gonna be fine.

39:10.942 --> 39:12.877
It's over, Gusano.
Let Dakota go.

39:12.911 --> 39:14.345
She's <i>my</i> daughter!

39:14.379 --> 39:16.379
Back off, all of you...

39:16.414 --> 39:19.249
And she won't get hurt.

39:19.284 --> 39:20.617
I just want what's mine!

39:20.651 --> 39:22.152
Skip, stay back!

39:22.186 --> 39:24.154
No, Skip!
Let go of her!

39:35.032 --> 39:36.933
We need an ambulance.

39:36.967 --> 39:38.802
We're at the Tourraine, sir.
Push it!

39:40.303 --> 39:42.671
Oh, please don't let him die, too!

39:42.706 --> 39:45.340
Okay, baby, let me help him, okay?

39:45.375 --> 39:47.042
Just let me help him.
Put your hand there.

39:47.077 --> 39:48.210
It's all right.

39:48.245 --> 39:49.912
It's okay, sweetheart.

39:49.947 --> 39:51.747
- Just put your hand there.
- It's okay.

39:51.782 --> 39:53.683
You're gonna be all right.

39:53.717 --> 39:56.920
Just hang on, okay?
It's okay.

40:03.760 --> 40:05.061
Mmm.

40:05.095 --> 40:07.362
Mmm.

40:09.165 --> 40:11.700
You really should limit
your red-meat consumption.

40:11.734 --> 40:15.203
I'm gonna eat whatever I want,
whenever I want from now on.

40:15.238 --> 40:16.738
Life is too short.

40:16.772 --> 40:18.373
I thought the girl's father was okay.

40:18.407 --> 40:20.909
Mm. He is.
He got lucky.

40:20.944 --> 40:23.144
He'll be out of the hospital
in a few days.

40:23.179 --> 40:24.713
I, however, am still recovering.

40:24.748 --> 40:27.316
It looks delicious.
Maybe just a bite.

40:29.219 --> 40:30.720
No, Maura, come on!

40:30.755 --> 40:32.188
That's not a bite.
That's half my burger!

40:32.223 --> 40:34.157
Good news. I've just come
from the hospital.

40:34.192 --> 40:36.293
Gerry Kincaid regained consciousness.
He's gonna make it.

40:36.327 --> 40:37.927
That's not good news.
That's <i>excellent</i> news.

40:37.962 --> 40:39.929
And how's Josh?

40:39.964 --> 40:42.266
Cavanaugh's charging him
with B&E, like he should.

40:42.300 --> 40:43.967
Oh, I believe the parenting books

40:44.002 --> 40:45.469
call that "tough love," dad.

40:45.503 --> 40:47.338
Yeah, I didn't tell him the D.A.
Is not gonna prosecute

40:47.372 --> 40:50.107
because he's testifying against
his scumbag friend Gavin.

40:50.142 --> 40:52.944
Well, I hope a <i>former</i> friend.

40:52.978 --> 40:54.245
Maura's eating all of my burger.

40:54.279 --> 40:56.013
I'm gonna order another one.
You want one?

40:56.048 --> 40:58.182
No, thanks. I'm, uh...

40:58.216 --> 40:59.535
Meeting Melody.

41:01.086 --> 41:03.220
Ooooooh!

41:06.356 --> 41:08.324
Oh, uh, do you think that maybe later

41:08.358 --> 41:10.126
you can help me work on my jab?

41:10.160 --> 41:11.927
Yeah, I promise
to teach you self-defense

41:11.962 --> 41:13.495
if you promise not to punch
like a girl.

41:13.529 --> 41:17.499
- Wh-- I don't punch like a girl.
- Yeah, you do.
- Mmm!

41:17.534 --> 41:19.902
- I'm gonna get some fries. You want an order?
- No.

41:21.204 --> 41:22.471
Yes, I -- I'll just have one or two.

41:22.505 --> 41:24.373
You're getting your own order.

41:24.407 --> 41:26.274
Are you gonna order
some dessert, too?

41:26.309 --> 41:28.443
You eat like a bottomless pit.

41:28.478 --> 41:31.046
Yes, we'll get dessert, too.
