02:32.402 --> 02:35.394
I DON'T KNOW--
I FELT SOMETHING--

02:35.489 --> 02:40.404
SOMETHING FUNNY, LIKE
THE SENSATION OF SPEED.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.326
I CAN'T PUT
MY FINGER ON IT.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.427
WITH THE DOPPLER.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.433

03:10.524 --> 03:11.764
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.896
I BETTER CHECK
WITH LORAN.

03:14.986 --> 03:15.976

03:16.071 --> 03:16.936
HOLD IT A MINUTE.

03:22.369 --> 03:27.284
SKIPPER, LORAN INDICATES A

03:27.374 --> 03:29.240
I NEVER HEARD OF A

04:15.297 --> 04:16.913
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE WINGS.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.623
IT'S THE TRUE
AIRSPEED THAT COUNTS.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.673

MEANS NOTHING.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.253

04:35.525 --> 04:37.607
SKIPPER, WE ARE
PAST GANDER.

04:37.652 --> 04:41.020
VVE MUST BE DOING 3,000 KNOTS.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.607
TRY TO RAISE HARMON CONTROL
OR MONOTON OR BOSTON.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.616
AT THIS SPEED, YOU
MIGHT AS VVELL TRY

04:46.703 --> 04:48.114
<i>TO GET IDLEWILD.</i>

05:26.868 --> 05:28.404
<i>IDLEWILD, DO
YOU READ US?</i>

05:34.251 --> 05:36.333
IT'S NO SOAP.

05:36.378 --> 05:38.335

<i>IS NO REFLECTION ON THE

06:08.785 --> 06:11.948
IT'S A SAFE, WELL-ENGINEERED,
PERFECTLY DESIGNED MACHINE

06:12.038 --> 06:13.779
AND THE MEN YOU'VE JUST MET

06:13.874 --> 06:16.582
ARE A TRAINED, COOL,
HIGHLY EFFICIENT TEAM.

06:16.668 --> 06:19.376
THE PROBLEM IS SIMPLY THAT
THE PLANE IS GOING TOO FAST

06:19.421 --> 06:21.958
AND THERE IS NOTHING VVITHIN
THE REALM OF KNOWLEDGE

06:22.048 --> 06:24.380
OR AT LEAST LOGIC
TO EXPLAIN IT.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.383
UNBEKNOWNST TO

06:26.469 --> 06:29.211
THIS AEROPLANE IS HEADING

07:06.718 --> 07:09.005
LET ME PUT IT
TO YOU THIS WAY:

07:09.095 --> 07:11.632
I ONLY HOPE THAT THE \/ALHALLA
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

07:11.723 --> 07:14.590
IS AT THE METROPOLITAN OPERA
HOUSE IN LITTLE OLD NEW YORK.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.516
INSTEAD OF...?

07:16.603 --> 07:20.517
INSTEAD OF A CONDUCTED TOUR
THROUGH THE REAL THING.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.189
WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.936
HOW BAD?

07:23.985 --> 07:26.602
THEY DON'T KNOW YET.

07:26.696 --> 07:27.902
GO AHEAD, SERVE IT.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.028
OH, PAULA.
REMEMBER:

07:33.119 --> 07:36.362
"COFFEE, TEA OR MILK?"
AND WITH A SMILE.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.448
<i>YEAH, WELL, YOU'VE GOT A DEAL.</i>

07:48.134 --> 07:49.670
(woman) YOU KNOW, YOU

07:49.761 --> 07:52.048
WELL, I HAD AN AUNT
ONCE IN BOISE, IDAHO,

07:52.138 --> 07:53.640

07:58.895 --> 08:00.397
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT,

08:00.480 --> 08:02.812
THERE WERE FIVE
MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS

08:02.857 --> 08:06.395
VVHO VVERE BIDDING JUST TO GET HER
LIVER IN A BOTTLE ON DISPLAY.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.978
BUT HER MOTHER-- THAT
WAS MY FATHER'S SISTER--

08:09.072 --> 08:11.985
SHE ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO
LET THEM SHOW HER LIVER.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.692
AND IT WAS LIKE I SAID TO
MY LATE HUSBAND, YOU CAN...

08:14.786 --> 08:17.824
WHAT DID YOU SAY
YOU WERE, DEAR?

08:17.872 --> 08:20.330
GROUP CAPTAIN, MADAME.

08:20.375 --> 08:23.709

08:40.437 --> 08:42.269

08:42.355 --> 08:45.097
WELL, I FELT A LITTLE
QUEASY WHEN WE TOOK OFF

08:45.191 --> 08:47.603
BUT LIKE MY LATE HUSBAND
ALVVAYS USED TO SAY

08:47.694 --> 08:50.106
I'VE GOT A STOMACH
THAT'S JUST IIKE--

08:54.200 --> 08:55.361
IT'S ODD.

08:55.452 --> 08:56.988
IT'S VERY ODD, INDEED.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.989
I HAVE THE STRANGEST
SENSATION OF SPEED.

09:01.875 --> 09:02.956
ACCELERATION.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.408

WELL, WHAT
ABOUT IT?

09:26.149 --> 09:27.560
NOT A
THING, CAPTAIN.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.475
NOT A
SINGLE THING.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.277
EITHER EVERYBODY OUT
THERE IS OFF VVHACK-

09:32.363 --> 09:33.819
EVERYBODY--
OR WE ARE.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.113
CHECK YOUR
EQUIPMENT AGAIN.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.110
I CHECKED IT
FOUR TIMES!

09:36.201 --> 09:37.282
KNOCK IT OFF.

09:37.368 --> 09:38.870
I MIGHT
AS WELL TRY

09:38.953 --> 09:39.943
TO PULL OUR VVAY
THROUGH AND SEE IF-

09:40.038 --> 09:45.124
[thunderous roar]

09:45.210 --> 09:46.996
DID WE HIT
SOMETHING?

09:47.087 --> 09:49.499
I DON'T KNOW.
CHECK FOR DAMAGE.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.751
NUMBER THREE AND FOUR
ARE STILL ON THE WING.

09:51.841 --> 09:52.922
THEY LOOK OKAY.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.420
DITTO ONE
AND TWO.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.127
EVERYTHING SEEMS
TO BE IN A PIECE.

09:56.221 --> 09:57.928
PURCELL, GO AFT AND
CHECK FOR CABIN DAMAGE.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.098
REPORT BACK
RIGHT AWAY.

09:59.182 --> 10:00.422
RIGHT.

10:00.517 --> 10:01.678
I'D BETTER GET
ON THE HORN

10:01.768 --> 10:02.974
AND CALM
DOWN ANYBODY

10:03.061 --> 10:04.426
THAT NEEDS
CALMING DOWN.

10:04.521 --> 10:05.306
TELL THE GIRLS
TO STAY WITH IT.

10:05.396 --> 10:06.147
RIGHT.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.189
WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.983
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
KIND OF TROUBLE.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.858
THAT LIGHT, THAT CRAZY
LIGHT- VVHAT VVAS IT?

10:14.948 --> 10:17.155
THAT'S SOMETHING VVE'LL
HA\/E TO FIND OUT.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.483
QUICK TOO.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.830
WHAT WAS THAT
SHAKING? TURBULENCE?

10:21.913 --> 10:24.530
I DOUBT IT. IT
VVAS MORE LIKE A--

10:24.624 --> 10:25.659
LIKE A--

10:25.750 --> 10:27.866
LIKE A WHAT?

10:27.961 --> 10:30.293
LIKE A
SOUND SHOCKWAVE.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.126
AS IF VVE'D GONE PAST
THE SPEED OF SOUND.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.632
YOU MEAN WE
HIT MACH ONE?

10:35.677 --> 10:37.793
WE BROKE THE
SOUND BARRIER?

10:37.846 --> 10:40.178
BUT WE DIDN'T GET
ANY MACH WARNING BELL.

10:40.265 --> 10:41.972
WE PROBABLY
WOULDN'T HAVE

10:42.058 --> 10:45.551
NOT VVITH A TRUE
AIRSPEED OF ONLY 470.

10:45.645 --> 10:49.058
I DON'T KNOVV VVHAT IT IS.
I JUST DON'T KNOVV.

10:49.149 --> 10:53.985
SEE, MAGELLAN'S LAST SPEED
CHECK VVAS 3,000 KNOTS.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.986
VVE COULD HA\/E GONE THROUGH
SOME KIND OF A SOUND BARRIER

10:57.073 --> 11:01.158
BUT, UH, NO KIND OF A SOUND
BARRIERI EVER HEARD OF.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.113

GIVE ME A FIX NOVV?

11:14.340 --> 11:16.923
<i>GLOBAL 33 TO

11:17.010 --> 11:19.251
WHATEVER THAT
BUMP WAS, SKIPPER,

11:19.345 --> 11:21.256
IT'S REALLY KNOCKED
OUT EVERYTHING.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.180
<i>GLOBAL 33, MONCTON.</i>

11:24.267 --> 11:29.103

CAPTAIN, I CAN'T
REACH GANDER,

11:30.857 --> 11:33.224
MONCTON OR
BOSTON OR ANYBODY.

11:33.318 --> 11:37.858
EITHER THEY'RE OFF THE
AIR OR VVE ARE OR BOTH.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.325

11:40.408 --> 11:42.194
<i>I'LL NEED A HEADING TO IDLEWILD</i>

11:42.285 --> 11:44.117

VVE'LL GO DOVVN TO
ESTABLISH VISUAL CONTACT.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.072
SKIPPER, YOU
CAN'T DO THAT.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.078
IF WE LEAVE
THIS ALTITUDE,

11:51.169 --> 11:52.751
WELL RUN INTO 2O
OTHER FLIGHTS.

11:52.837 --> 11:56.375
HAVE YOU GOT ANY OTHER
ALTERNATIVE, CRAIG?

11:56.424 --> 11:58.085
<i>SOONER OR LATER,

12:00.094 --> 12:02.802
WITHOUT RADIO CONTACT,
WE'RE DEAF AND DUMB.

12:02.889 --> 12:06.382
AS LONG AS VVE STAY UP
HERE, VVE'RE ALSO BLIND.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.387
THERE'S NO DAMAGE
THERE, SKIP.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.310
EVERYBODY'S SHOOK
UP AND CURIOUS.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.728
THEY'RE ALSO
PLENTY SCARED.

12:12.815 --> 12:17.434
THEM AND ME.

12:17.528 --> 12:20.611
WELL, "OURS IS NOT
TO REASON WHY."

12:20.698 --> 12:23.030

12:23.117 --> 12:25.495
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THIS IS CAPTAIN FARVER.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.741
<i>I JUST WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT
EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL</i>

12:28.831 --> 12:30.788
<i>AND THERE
IS NO DANGER.</i>

12:30.875 --> 12:32.582
<i>WE ENCOUNTERED A LITTLE
CLEAR AIR TURBULENCE</i>

12:32.669 --> 12:35.286
<i>AND SOME
ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA</i>

12:35.380 --> 12:38.168
<i>BUT THERE'S' BEEN NO
DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT</i>

12:38.258 --> 12:41.341
<i>EXCEPT FOR SOME TEMPORARY

12:41.427 --> 12:43.634
<i>I REPEAT, THERE'S
NO CAUSE FOR ALARM</i>

12:43.721 --> 12:45.587
<i>AND I'LL KEEP

12:45.682 --> 12:48.014
<i>IF WE RUN ACCORDING

12:48.101 --> 12:50.718
<i>WE SHOULD BE LANDING AT IDLEWILD

12:50.812 --> 12:51.973
THANK YOU.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.767
PURCELL, WHAT'S
THE FUEL?

12:57.819 --> 13:01.107
71,435 POUNDS.

13:03.866 --> 13:08.531
I DON'T FEEL THAT STRANGE
SENSATION OF SPEED ANYMORE.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.861
MAGELLAN,
HOW ABOUT

13:09.956 --> 13:11.538
THAT HEADING
TO IDLEWILD?

13:13.918 --> 13:16.125
PART OF THIS IS
SCIENTIFIC, SKIPPER.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.877
PART OF IT'S
KENTUCKY WINDAGE.

13:17.964 --> 13:22.879
TRY 262, THAT'S AS
CLOSE AS I CAN GET.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.336
ALL RIGHT, YOU ALL KNOW
WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.421
WE HAVE NO
RADIO CONTACT.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.473
APPARENTLY, WE'RE OUT OF TOUCH
VVITH ALL GROUND-RADAR POINTS.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.176
WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE WE ARE.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.386
WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE
IF WE'RE ON AIRWAYS.

13:34.480 --> 13:38.223
BUT THIS BEAST GULPS FUEL. VVE
ALL KNOVV THAT ONLY TOO VVELL.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.480
<i>SO WE'VE GOT
ONE CHANCE.</i>

13:40.570 --> 13:42.527
<i>WE'LL GO DOWN
THROUGH THIS OVERCAST</i>

13:42.613 --> 13:44.820
<i>AND TRY TO FIND SOMETHING
THAT LOOKS FAMILIAR.</i>

13:44.866 --> 13:47.153
<i>UH... IT'S
VERY POSSIBLE</i>

13:47.243 --> 13:48.654
<i>THAT WE MIGHT
HIT SOMETHING</i>

13:48.745 --> 13:50.361
<i>ON THE WAY DOWN--</i>

13:50.455 --> 13:52.321
<i>BUT IT'S A CHANCE
WE'VE GOT TO TAKE.</i>

13:52.373 --> 13:54.660
VVELL, I JUST VVANTED YOU
TO KNOVV VVHERE VVE STAND

13:54.709 --> 13:57.576
SO EVERYBODY KEEP A SHARP
LOOKOUT FOR ANY OTHER TRAFFIC

13:57.670 --> 14:00.753
AND KEEP YOUR
FINGERS CROSSED.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.674
I GUESS A FEVV PRAYERS WOULDN'T
BE OUT OF ORDER EITHER.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.377
ALL RIGHT, CRAIG,
LET'S GO DOWN.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.462
HIT THE
HORN BUTTON.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.975
[engines become louder]

14:32.955 --> 14:34.286
[engines fade to normal]

14:46.594 --> 14:47.755
SKIPPER?

14:52.308 --> 14:54.640
I DON'T GET IT.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.889
IT HAPPENS TO BE
A FACT, THOUGH.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.481
THAT'S MANHATTAN
ISLAND DOWN THERE.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.305
MANHATTAN ISLAND?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.892
HOW COULD IT BE
MANHATTAN ISLAND?

15:02.944 --> 15:04.400
WH--WHERE'S
THE SKYLINE?

15:04.487 --> 15:06.398
WHERE ARE ALL
THE BUILDINGS?

15:06.489 --> 15:08.571
I DON'T KNOVV VVHERE THEY ARE,
BUT THAT'S NEVV YORK CITY.

15:08.658 --> 15:11.320
ONE LITTLE ITEM
SEEMS TO BE AMISS.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.651
THE PASSENGERS...

15:12.745 --> 15:13.985
YEAH, I DON'T
BLAME THEM.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.741
WELL, WE'RE OVER LAND.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.164
I DON'T SEE ANY...

15:18.251 --> 15:20.413
ANY WHAT, JANIE?

15:20.503 --> 15:22.414
<i>ANY CITY, RIGHT?</i>

15:22.463 --> 15:24.249

ISLAND DOVVN THERE.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.091
THERE'S THE
EAST RIVER.

15:29.178 --> 15:30.509
THERE'S THE
HUDSON RIVER.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.303
THAT'S STATEN ISLAND.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.631
VVE'\/E GOT ALL THE
TOPOGRAPHICAL CLUES VVE NEED.

15:34.725 --> 15:37.137
THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE
THE REAL ESTATE'S THERE,

15:37.228 --> 15:41.847
IT'S JUST THE CITY AND EIGHT
MILLION PEOPLE ARE MISSING.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.524
IN SHORT, THERE
IS NO NEW YORK.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.226
IT'S DISAPPEARED.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.449
SKIPPER, VERIFY SOMETHING
FOR ME, WOULD YOU?

15:49.490 --> 15:51.151
<i>AND IN A HURRY?</i>

15:51.242 --> 15:52.357
<i>LOOK!</i>

15:56.664 --> 15:58.120
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.948
WHAT IN THE NAME
OF EVERYTHING HOLY

16:00.001 --> 16:00.991
IS GOING ON?

16:32.200 --> 16:33.690
<i>(Paula)
WHAT'S THE SCORE?</i>

16:33.784 --> 16:35.650
WE'VE BEEN CIRCLING
FOR A HALF AN HOUR.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.285
THEY SAID THEY'D
KEEP IN TOUCH,

16:37.371 --> 16:38.577
BUT NOT TO COME IN.

16:41.751 --> 16:45.415
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
THINK, SKIPPER?

16:45.505 --> 16:46.836
WELL, WE'VE
FLOWN OVER

16:46.881 --> 16:49.418

BE SCHENECTADY,

16:49.509 --> 16:53.844
ALBANY, POINTS NORTH--

16:53.888 --> 16:56.425
I'LL GIVE YOU A
SURMISE, GENTLEMEN.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.257
YOU MAY VVANT TO TRUSS
ME UP VVITH ROPES

16:58.351 --> 17:00.183
BUT IT'S THE ONLY SINGLE
EXPLANATION I CAN GI\/E.

17:00.228 --> 17:03.687
SOMEHOW IN
SOME WAY,

17:03.773 --> 17:06.013
VVE NOT ONLY VVENT THROUGH
THE SOUND BARRIER

17:06.067 --> 17:09.105

BACK IN TIME.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.607

DO ABOUT IT?

17:11.696 --> 17:13.438
SKIPPER?

17:13.532 --> 17:16.695
FUEL IS DOWN TO
49,435 POUNDS.

17:16.743 --> 17:21.032
THEN HERE'S WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO DO ABOUT IT.

17:21.082 --> 17:22.789
WE'RE GOING TO
PUSH THIS BABY UP

17:22.875 --> 17:25.367
UNTIL SHE'S GOING
AS FAST AS SHE CAN.

17:25.419 --> 17:28.707

17:28.798 --> 17:32.007
<i>AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TRY TO

VVE'RE GONNA MAKE IT!

18:15.803 --> 18:17.305
VVE'RE PICKING IT UP AGAIN.
DO YOU FEEL IT?

18:17.388 --> 18:18.719
WE'RE PICKING
IT UP AGAIN.

18:18.806 --> 18:23.266
[thunderous roaring]

18:23.352 --> 18:25.605

19:16.906 --> 19:18.317
NOTHING DOING,

19:18.366 --> 19:20.152
OUR V.H.F.
IS STILL OUT.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.573
MAYBE THEIR'S
IS OUT, TOO.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.322
TRY USING A
HIGH FREQUENCY.

19:23.371 --> 19:24.702
I DID
ALREADY, CAPTAIN.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.621
THERE'S NOTHING
FROM IDLEWILD.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.323
WHAT ABOUT

19:28.417 --> 19:30.749
SOMEBODY OUGHT

20:15.548 --> 20:17.630
LA GUARDIA,
THIS IS A JET.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.049
WE HAVE FOUR,
BIG LOVELY TURBINES

20:20.094 --> 20:22.756
AND THEY'RE GETTING HUNGRY,
RUNNING SHORT ON FUEL.

20:22.847 --> 20:25.134
VVE VVANT A RADAR

CAPTAIN, THEIR
LONGEST RUNWAY

20:37.862 --> 20:39.444
IS LESS THAN
5,000 FEET.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.487
DO YOU THINK VVE OUGHT

20:41.574 --> 20:45.488
<i>GLOBAL 33, YOU'RE CLEARED

<i>TO THE C.A.A. OFFICE

KEEP IN TOUCH.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.501

20:59.592 --> 21:01.754
THEY HAVEN'T CALLED THE
FEDERAL AVIATION AGENCY

21:01.844 --> 21:04.085
C.A.A. IN YEARS.

21:04.138 --> 21:06.630
NOW, WE'RE GOING
DOWN BELOW, CRAIG.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.931
HIT THE HORN BUTTON.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.901
SKIPPER, D-D-DO YOU
KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

21:31.165 --> 21:34.203
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT IT IS.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.705
IT'S THE NEW YORK
WORLD'S FAIR.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.787
THE NEW YORK
WORLD'S FAIR?

21:38.881 --> 21:40.371
BUT THAT MEANS
WE'D BE BACK IN...

21:40.466 --> 21:43.208
1939.

21:43.302 --> 21:46.010
WE CAME BACK.

21:46.096 --> 21:48.053
WE CAME BACK

21:48.140 --> 21:50.051
BUT, DEAR GOD,
NOT FAR ENOUGH.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.854
WE CAN'T LAND...

21:56.941 --> 21:59.649
WE CAN'T LAND
AT LA GUARDIA.

21:59.693 --> 22:05.063
WE CAN'T LAND

22:07.284 --> 22:09.696
W-W-WHAT ABOUT
THE PASSENGERS?

22:13.874 --> 22:16.832
I THINK...

22:16.919 --> 22:20.833
WE BETTER LET
THEM IN ON IT.

22:20.881 --> 22:24.419
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

22:24.510 --> 22:28.128

AND IT'S 1939.

23:09.805 --> 23:12.046
BUT WE'RE GOING TO TRY
TO INCREASE OUR SPEED

23:12.099 --> 23:14.261

THE SAME SOUND BARRIER

DONE TWICE BEFORE.

YOU REMAIN CALM AND PRAY.
