01:20.080 --> 01:22.248
- I'm hungry.
- Me too.

01:22.332 --> 01:25.418
- Should I try to make us something?
- I'm not that hungry.

01:25.502 --> 01:28.337
- Drama's gotta be down soon, right?
- Got to be.

01:28.505 --> 01:29.922
Did you call
about his car?

01:30.007 --> 01:31.382
Be good as new by noon.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.050
- Kid's gonna freak.
- Totally.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.970
- What are we eatin'?
- Eh, that's a good question.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.723
- Where's Drama?
- Another good question.

01:38.807 --> 01:41.934
- Sleeping probably.
- Really? Wow.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.352
Well, it's his
big day.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.521
He wants to sleep late,
he should be able to sleep late.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.190
I know. I'm hungry.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.984
- You want me to make you something, E?
- I ain't that hungry, Turtle.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.278
All right, guys,
let's not all panic.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.363
He'll be down soon,
so let's sit.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.365
We'll talk,

01:56.450 --> 01:58.284
wait it out together.

02:03.207 --> 02:04.791
Sorry I overslept,
fellas.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.001
Who's hungry?

02:08.878 --> 02:10.295
You all right, Drama?
You look awful.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.049
Eh...
had a rough night.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.552
Nobody looked at any
reviews, did they?

02:16.637 --> 02:18.805
You told us
not to, so no.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.890
There's one right here though,
if you wanna take a peek.

02:23.352 --> 02:24.811
No reviews!

02:25.312 --> 02:27.688
- What are you worried about, Johnny?
- I don't know.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.816
I felt good
about the show and all,

02:30.442 --> 02:31.859
but now that
it's actually airing...

02:31.944 --> 02:33.611
The show is great, Drama.
Just relax.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.196
It really is, Drama,
and this is coming

02:35.280 --> 02:36.864
from someone
who's never liked your work.

02:38.242 --> 02:40.827
- You guys really like it?
- Johnny, we really like it

02:40.911 --> 02:43.412
and everyone else will too.
So please relax.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.749
Yeah, relax.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.210
That's all
I gotta do today,

02:50.170 --> 02:51.379
just relax.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.507
What the fuck
was that?

03:02.266 --> 03:04.267
If that isn't a sign,
I don't know what is.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.518
A sign of what?

03:05.602 --> 03:07.728
A sign that my show
is going down in flames.

03:07.813 --> 03:09.355
Oh, don't
get crazy.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.441
A bird kills itselfjust to destroy
my eggs, and I'm getting crazy?

03:13.110 --> 03:14.652
God, I don't need
another failure.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.779
Oh, would you look at this?

03:17.114 --> 03:19.031
This is so exciting.
It's like when "The Warriors"

03:19.116 --> 03:20.783
got back together
at the end of the movie.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.743
Don't tell me you whack
off to "The Warriors. " There they are,

03:22.828 --> 03:24.912
a movie star
and a TV star...

03:24.997 --> 03:27.164
all in one family.
Who would've thunk it?

03:27.583 --> 03:29.041
Lloyd, don't tell me
about any reviews,

03:29.126 --> 03:30.793
'cause I don't
wanna know.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.880
Rest assured, I have had every "Variety"
banished from the building.

03:33.964 --> 03:37.550
Drama, it's NBC.
They gave "Joey" 46 episodes,

03:37.634 --> 03:39.719
They don't cancel shit.
Trust me.

03:39.803 --> 03:42.305
Movie star, the manager,
in the big office.

03:44.308 --> 03:45.516
Anyone need a drink?

03:45.601 --> 03:47.727
- Get this guy a Scotch.
- I'll grab some waters.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.437
There's a "Variety"
right there, Lloyd!

03:49.771 --> 03:51.147
It's yesterday's, Drama.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.234
- Oh.
- Jesus, you're losing it, Drama.

03:55.319 --> 03:56.986
Sit down.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.497
- You wanna hit a rub-and-tug?
- Now?

04:08.582 --> 04:10.291
Yeah, I gotta shed
some nerves.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.960
Think I gotta wait
for Vince and E, no?

04:13.295 --> 04:15.504
All right,
you do that.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.423
- How are you gonna get there?
- I'll call a cab.

04:18.507 --> 04:21.260
Honey, do you mind
calling me a cab, please? Thank you.

04:22.638 --> 04:26.557
Before we jump into anything,
I just wanna say

04:26.892 --> 04:28.976
I am glad
to have you guys back.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.854
- We're not back, Ari.
- Ari, we're not back.

04:32.230 --> 04:33.272
I'm not following you.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.316
- We want "Medellin. "
- It's all we've ever wanted.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.777
- "Medellin" is dead.
Undead it.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.904
- ARl: What is this, a test?
- No, it's not a test.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.365
Okay, look, let's just
talk reasonably, okay?

04:42.491 --> 04:44.742
Sometimes things just
aren't meant to be.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.870
Sometimes, no matter how bad you want
something, you gotta let it go.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.622
Senior year,
all right,

04:49.706 --> 04:52.792
I was obsessed with Katie Sherman...
the most insane tits.

04:52.876 --> 04:56.253
Anyway, the moment I found out that she
gave half the football team crabs,

04:56.338 --> 04:59.131
I was done.
Never thought about it again.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.591
You saying "Medellin" has
crabs, Ari?

05:00.676 --> 05:03.761
"Medellin" has crabs,
gonorrhea, syphilis.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.555
It is an
untreatable supergerm.

05:06.890 --> 05:09.433
This project has been plagued
since day one.

05:09.518 --> 05:10.559
Let it go.

05:13.772 --> 05:15.231
The movie's
in turnaround, Ari.

05:15.357 --> 05:18.484
Find someone
who can get it out. Or don't.

05:18.944 --> 05:21.112
Great new offices.
- Vinny... Vinny, wait.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.992
Joe Roberts, the guy that offered you
"Matterhorn," always loved you.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.577
Deep pockets, has the power to make
anything happen.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.539
I will set up a lunch,
but I can't promise anything.

05:31.957 --> 05:34.917
Well, neither can we.
See ya.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.684
Oh, there he is,
the big TV star.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.853
- Hey, Maxie. What's the haps?
- You are.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.646
You the talk
of the whole shop.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.231
Hope your show
don't get canceled,

05:57.315 --> 05:59.525
'cause everyone'll get
real depressed around here.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.653
Yeah, well, anyway,
will you please tell Ruthie I'm here

06:02.988 --> 06:04.864
and I'm in need?

06:04.948 --> 06:07.533
Would love to,
but Ruthie out of town.

06:07.617 --> 06:11.037
Oh, no no,
don't tell me that, not today.

06:11.121 --> 06:14.206
Relax, Johnny.
Ruthie's sister here filling in.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.467
Oh yeah.
That'll work.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.097
Hi there.

06:35.312 --> 06:38.647
- All right, see ya.
- That's great. Appreciate it.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.361
Hey, I'm here
to pick up my car.

06:45.489 --> 06:48.949
- I like your kicks.
- Oh yeah?

06:49.451 --> 06:51.911
I could take you to the only place
in the city where you can get 'em.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.829
I mean, you'd have
to roll with me, of course.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.882
- You like sneakers?
- Let me go check on your car.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.885
You, motherfucker,
are early.

07:08.011 --> 07:10.012
- You said 12:00.
- I said 1:00.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.139
Come on, Rufus,
you said 12:00.

07:12.224 --> 07:14.183
Well, now I'm saying 1:00,
2:30 the latest.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.769
You wanna cry or you wanna wait?

07:16.853 --> 07:19.855
- Can I wait near her?
- That's my daughter, Turtle.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.817
So no,
you motherfucking cannot.

07:23.068 --> 07:26.195
Liked you better
when you were selling stereos.

07:26.905 --> 07:29.740
What do I want
with "Medellin," guys, huh?

07:29.825 --> 07:31.158
It's somebody
else's trash.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.911
The movie's been at two studios,
gone through three directors.

07:33.995 --> 07:37.248
You know Haggis has moved
onto another picture by now, right?

07:37.332 --> 07:39.041
- No, we didn't know that.
- Did you know that, Ari?

07:39.126 --> 07:41.335
Yes, I knew that, Eric.
The project is dead.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.838
- Everyone's moved on but Pablo Escobar.
- And us.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.840
And you, you beautiful
stubborn artist, you.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.466
That is the point
of this lunch.

07:47.551 --> 07:49.301
Joe is gonna
revive it.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.303
Come on, pony up, Joe.
Let's make this movie.

07:51.388 --> 07:54.014
Guys, this movie
is a three-hour epic bloodbath.

07:54.099 --> 07:57.393
- It's got zero commercial appeal.
- Respectfully, we disagree.

07:57.561 --> 07:59.520
We think it could be
like "Scarface," Joe.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.313
"Scarface" was a bomb
at the box office.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.982
"Scarface" was
ahead of its time.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.151
"Medellin" isn't.
"Medellin" is now.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.486
Joe, think about it.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.990
Pablo Escobar was an outlaw
who terrorized a whole country

08:11.074 --> 08:12.825
while remaining the biggest
philanthropist

08:12.909 --> 08:14.285
his people had ever known.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.329
Now ask yourself this: In 2007,

08:17.414 --> 08:20.166
in this country,
what could possibly evoke

08:20.250 --> 08:22.501
more of a stir than
to explore the humanity

08:22.586 --> 08:24.086
of that kind of evil?

08:28.508 --> 08:29.592
You really
wanna do this, Vince?

08:29.759 --> 08:32.094
More than anything
I've ever wanted to do in this business.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.138
Hmm, Pablo Escobar, huh?

08:34.306 --> 08:36.015
You don't think
you're too skinny?

08:36.099 --> 08:37.265
I could play Pablo Escobar.

08:45.525 --> 08:48.194
Sorry about this.
I'm just a bit distracted.

08:48.278 --> 08:51.447
I know, you taking
over an hour.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.574
Is there anything
else I can do?

08:53.658 --> 08:56.994
No, it's okay, just keep doing
what you're doing.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.377
What is it
distracting you?

09:06.463 --> 09:08.088
That.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.007
I didn't know
you had a subscription.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.800
Ah, customer
must have left it.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.552
You can read
if you think it will help.

09:13.637 --> 09:16.513
No no.
It won't help.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.605
Maybe it'll help.

09:31.571 --> 09:35.241
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.536
Fucking Paul Schneider.

09:41.456 --> 09:42.456
Schneider...

09:42.540 --> 09:44.833
- Hey, what's up, Drama?
- Hey, Lenny.

09:48.630 --> 09:51.090
Fucking cocksucking
piece of shit.

09:51.174 --> 09:52.216
Taxi!

09:55.720 --> 09:58.514
Take me to "Daily Variety,"
on the hop.

09:58.974 --> 10:01.934
- What do you think of these?
- Yeah, those are pretty cool,

10:02.018 --> 10:04.019
but they're not as cool
as the Fearless Warriors.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.272
I mean, those were the best
Air Force Ones ever made.

10:06.356 --> 10:07.940
Yeah, that was
a fly shoe,

10:08.024 --> 10:10.442
but I like the Self Doubt
color way better.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.820
Well, actually, I'll tell you what's
better than both of 'em...

10:12.904 --> 10:14.530
the original Cartoons.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.657
Yeah, those were hot.

10:17.117 --> 10:20.577
Well, I happen to know that Cartoon's
got new limiteds dropping next summer.

10:20.704 --> 10:23.789
January, actually. And they'll be called
the Cartoon New Years.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.292
You know, you...
you're very pretty,

10:26.376 --> 10:27.960
you're just sadly
very misinformed.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.337
Bet on it.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.423
- Come on.
- I don't bet with girls.

10:32.507 --> 10:34.133
Hmm, chickenshit.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.760
Turtle!
Your fucking car is done.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.887
Now go and get it,
and then go.

10:39.389 --> 10:42.641
All right,
I'm going, I'm going.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.146
Hmm.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.025
Whoo.
That's beautiful.

10:51.526 --> 10:53.527
- You did a great job, Rufus.
- Yeah.

10:54.904 --> 10:58.198
- With your daughter too.
- Goodbye, Turtle.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.952
Bye, Rufus.

11:08.418 --> 11:09.626
Oh!

11:11.379 --> 11:13.547
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
- Come on.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.507
Damn.

11:15.884 --> 11:18.427
God damn, that was stupid.
- Shit.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.221
Let me think about this, okay?
Let me ponder it.

11:21.306 --> 11:22.806
- I'll get back to you.
- Thanks, Joe.

11:22.891 --> 11:24.558
- E, it's a pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.352
- Joe.
- It's been real, Ari.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.020
- Thank you for lunch, buddy.
- Take care, guys.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.313
All right.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.858
- Wow.
- What?

11:32.942 --> 11:35.569
I think I just saw
the next 50 years of your life...

11:35.695 --> 11:38.530
actor, activist,
politician,

11:38.615 --> 11:41.325
president. No, I mean, you were...
you were passionate,

11:41.409 --> 11:43.494
eloquent, succinct
and intelligent

11:43.578 --> 11:44.745
in a way I have
never seen before.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.039
It was like when a father
sees his baby boy

11:47.123 --> 11:49.291
become a man
for the first time.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.543
- Bravo.
- Ari, that's sweet.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.712
Stop kissing my ass
and get it done.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.215
You know what? It's getting done, baby,
it's getting done.

11:56.299 --> 11:58.342
- I can feel it.
- Yeah, you've felt it before.

11:58.426 --> 12:01.053
Too many times.
- For all my past sins,

12:01.137 --> 12:02.179
I will deliver.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.223
I promise you,
I will deliver.

12:04.307 --> 12:07.309
Hey, asshole, where's my car?
I gave you my ticket first.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.687
- Paul Schneider's office?
- Right, right, left, left.

12:10.772 --> 12:13.315
- Is he expecting you?
- I doubt it.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.988
Excuse me.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.076
Excuse me, do you know
where Paul Schneider is?

12:24.160 --> 12:27.413
- Over there.
- Thank you. Paul Schneider!

12:27.497 --> 12:29.206
Show yourself!

12:30.041 --> 12:31.417
Where are you,
Paul Schneider?

12:31.501 --> 12:33.001
I'm sorry,
I'm Paul's assistant.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.294
Is there something
I can help you with?

12:34.379 --> 12:36.171
No, that's okay,
I'll help myself.

12:42.220 --> 12:45.097
- Schneider!
- What the hell is this?

12:45.181 --> 12:46.890
I tried to stop him.
I'm sorry.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.684
It's all right, Ryan.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.520
Johnny Chase.
Looks like you read the paper.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.940
I did. And I'm not leaving here
until you tell me why.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.443
Look, I just call it
like I see it, Johnny, that's all.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.528
You've had it in for me
ever since I got out here.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.573
15 years... you never
gave me a good review, not once!

13:03.283 --> 13:05.242
Did I try and fuck your wife
or something?

13:05.660 --> 13:08.120
Johnny, it's not personal,
it's not.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.830
I just... I just don't think
you're very good.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.248
Well, you're wrong.

13:11.332 --> 13:14.877
You... you sad little fat hack fuck,
you're wrong.

13:15.503 --> 13:18.213
Well, then I guess every other review
I've read is wrong too.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.382
Other reviews?

13:21.050 --> 13:22.926
- They're bad?
- Sorry, John.

13:24.429 --> 13:27.723
You know, maybe it's time
to think about another line of work.

13:27.891 --> 13:31.393
You're still young...
relatively.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.356
Turtle, there's no way
I can get this done today.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.692
Got way too many other jobs
and not enough manpower.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.986
Come on, Rufus.
Look, this ain't even for me.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.071
It's for Drama.
You know Drama.

13:43.198 --> 13:46.158
You know what a sad life
it's been for him. All right?

13:46.242 --> 13:48.994
But tonight we're hoping
that all that sadness will go away.

13:49.078 --> 13:51.830
That's a touching
fucking story, Turtle,

13:52.373 --> 13:53.749
but I got no men.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.336
Daddy, L.C.
Isn't doing anything.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.962
Baby, L.C.
Is eating lunch

13:59.380 --> 14:02.549
and I don't go near L.C.
When he's eating lunch.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.345
Come on, Rufus.
Please?

14:06.429 --> 14:08.555
I'll bring him Mickey Ds
every day for a year.

14:09.807 --> 14:12.559
Dad, I'll ask him.
He's nice to me even when he's eating.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.645
Rufus, please.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.814
Fine. Okay.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.526
Kelly, thank you.

14:20.610 --> 14:23.695
But he waits here
where I can see him.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.615
Okay.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.576
Joe, what are you
doing to me?

14:29.661 --> 14:32.120
I'm not doing anything to you.
I'm just doing good business.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.290
That's weird, because it feels like
you're taking a steel catheter

14:35.375 --> 14:36.875
and shoving it
right up my cock!

14:36.960 --> 14:40.337
Ari, we were two weeks away
from production on "Matterhorn"

14:40.421 --> 14:43.090
when Colin broke his arm...
two weeks!

14:43.841 --> 14:45.676
Do you know what a devastating day
that was for me?

14:45.760 --> 14:47.970
Yeah, I do, Joe. We were playing golf
over at Sherwood.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.096
I thought
you were gonna cry.

14:49.180 --> 14:52.724
I wanted to make "Matterhorn"
since I first came to the town in 1976.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.518
It was called
"Big Thunder Mountain" then.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.187
That was before "Die Hard. "
You know why I wanted to make it?

14:57.272 --> 14:59.314
Simply because it had
monster potential.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.650
It still has monster potential.
You know that.

15:01.985 --> 15:04.945
- I do know that, Joe, I do.
- Good.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.864
Then Vince makes
"Matterhorn" for me.

15:08.199 --> 15:10.033
- I make "Medellin" for him.
- Joe...

15:11.661 --> 15:13.620
he won't do that.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.039
I mean, the kid's
got principles.

15:16.124 --> 15:17.499
But you
don't have any, Ari.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.335
So make it happen,
quickly.

15:21.212 --> 15:24.840
Joe.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.136
Fucker.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.729
- Where you going, Ari?
- Vince's.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.522
- Making a house call?
- Yep.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.525
Ooh, something is afoot.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.612
- What's up, Ari?
- Where's Vince?

15:46.696 --> 15:48.363
I wanna tell you both the news.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.616
Right here, Ari.
Better be good news.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.367
Do I ever
give you anything but?

15:52.493 --> 15:54.745
- Who wants to make "Medellin"?
- Are you serious?

15:54.996 --> 15:57.414
Not only that,
but I have this.

15:57.832 --> 15:58.915
What's that?

15:59.000 --> 16:02.336
I am so good, not only did I get you
your passion project,

16:02.462 --> 16:05.339
but I got you
your next big hit too.

16:08.051 --> 16:10.093
- "Matterhorn"?
- "Matterhorn. " Boom!

16:10.303 --> 16:12.054
Am I a fucking
magician or what?

16:12.138 --> 16:13.889
Yeah, you made
a shitty project reappear.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.725
Shitty? No, this is
a good project.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.895
- We were never into it.
- I know, that's the thing.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.105
The script has been
changed more times

16:22.190 --> 16:23.690
than Andy Dick's
vibrator.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.817
You will love it now,
Vince, trust me.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.444
I'm not interested
in "Matterhorn," Ari.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.279
Not even if I were to tell you
that Joe Roberts said

16:29.364 --> 16:32.574
if you do "Matterhorn" for him,
he will do "Medellin" for you?

16:33.951 --> 16:35.827
- Really?
- Really.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.954
- What's the catch?
- There is no catch.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.373
Which one goes first?

16:41.292 --> 16:43.251
That's the catch.
No thank you, Ari.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.754
- Vince...
- Ari, no no no.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.464
Vince, Vince, Vince,

16:47.590 --> 16:49.716
this is a good
goddamn project.

16:49.801 --> 16:52.010
I've been saying this
to you since day one.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.679
Why can't you
just be reasonable?

16:53.763 --> 16:55.263
Why can't you be reasonable
and understand

16:55.348 --> 16:56.431
that I don't care
if "Matterhorn"

16:56.516 --> 16:59.017
is the best project
in the history of movies?

16:59.102 --> 17:02.479
I want "Medellin. " I've wanted it
for two fucking years.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.815
So until someone tells me
that that will never happen,

17:04.898 --> 17:06.525
that is the only thing
I wanna do.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.489
- It will never happen.
- What?

17:12.781 --> 17:14.532
Not without you
doing "Matterhorn" first.

17:14.617 --> 17:15.992
Why not?

17:16.077 --> 17:19.954
Joe Roberts has put in
an offer to buy "Medellin. "

17:29.215 --> 17:32.551
Wow. This guy L.C.
Did an amazing job.

17:32.635 --> 17:35.470
- Car looks good as new.
- Again.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.598
- Thank you very much, Kelly.
- No problem.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.934
Hey, there's a sale
over at Undefeated this Saturday.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.603
Kelly, go to the office.

17:46.858 --> 17:48.567
I was just trying to make
a little conversation, that's all.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.235
Yeah, I would rather
you didn't.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.701
I'm one of the good guys,
Rufus, all right?

17:57.785 --> 17:59.161
You should know that.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.913
Okay, I'm loyal.
I work hard...

18:02.331 --> 18:03.373
kinda.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.876
And I respect
the father-daughter bond.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.669
That's why
I'm asking you...

18:08.045 --> 18:09.755
it's more like
pleading with you...

18:09.839 --> 18:12.758
all right, please, just give me
permission to take out your daughter.

18:12.842 --> 18:15.427
I'll treat her good.
I'll pay for dinner and everything.

18:16.179 --> 18:17.596
I'll even call you
every hour,

18:17.680 --> 18:19.389
give you an update.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.516
You could
even come, okay,

18:21.601 --> 18:23.518
if it'll make you
feel better.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.312
Come on, man,
what do you say?

18:27.106 --> 18:29.524
I say I like your old-school
nature, Turtle.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.276
Thank you.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.695
You got my permission,

18:34.030 --> 18:36.198
although I doubt
she'll say yes.

18:36.699 --> 18:37.741
We'll see.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.202
Kelly!

18:43.122 --> 18:44.206
What's going on?

18:44.665 --> 18:46.625
This young man wants
to ask you something.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.919
You want me to do this
right in front of you?

18:49.003 --> 18:50.128
You might as well
get used to it.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.048
Okay.

18:56.010 --> 18:57.719
All right...

18:58.012 --> 18:59.304
I will bet you,

18:59.388 --> 19:01.056
that those shoes
come out next summer.

19:01.224 --> 19:03.016
Yeah? What do you
want to bet?

19:03.351 --> 19:05.977
If I'm right,
you go out with me.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.398
And if you're wrong?

19:11.067 --> 19:12.234
I go out with you.

19:23.371 --> 19:24.496
I am so pissed.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.832
It's Ari. Every time
we get involved with this guy...

19:26.916 --> 19:28.834
It's not Ari.
It's this town.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.419
These people buy scripts they don't
even wanna make.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.089
'Cause it's about control. The more
they own, the more they control.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.300
- We cannot let them control us.
- Yeah, what can we do?

19:37.510 --> 19:39.845
Tell you what:
We can buy the script ourselves.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.097
I'm serious.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.099
- You want to buy "Medellin"?
- Yeah, why not?

19:44.892 --> 19:46.184
Because as sick
as it is, Vince,

19:46.269 --> 19:47.853
I think I have more
cash than you do.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.354
Yeah, but I got
something else.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.523
- What?
- This house.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.608
You wanna sell the house
to buy this script?

19:53.693 --> 19:57.112
It's too big anyway. And if Johnny's
show's a hit he'll be moving out.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.363
You fucking crazy?

19:58.447 --> 20:01.950
Maybe, but not crazy enough to let
anyone control me.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.619
Come on, I know
this is the one.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.288
So do you.
We'll be producers.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.332
Wanna roll the dice?

20:09.834 --> 20:11.960
It's always worked out
when we have.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.420
Hasn't it?

20:13.504 --> 20:16.089
$237,642.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.049
- What's that?
- Every penny I have in the world.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.343
How do you know
that exact number?

20:20.428 --> 20:21.803
'Cause I'm weird like that.
Whatever, I'm in.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.014
That's a sweet gesture,
but I can't let you.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.600
Fuck that. If we go down,
we're going down together.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.393
- We're not going down.
- No, we're not.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.187
What's up, Drama?

20:33.316 --> 20:34.858
I got every paper in the country.

20:34.984 --> 20:36.234
How's it looking?

20:37.612 --> 20:39.195
It's a bloodbath, bro.

20:42.158 --> 20:43.491
Better call Ari.

20:44.869 --> 20:45.911
You guys
still mad at me?

20:45.995 --> 20:47.996
Don't talk, Ari,
just listen.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.956
I don't wanna
hear your thoughts.

20:50.041 --> 20:53.043
I don't wanna hear your advice. I want
you to make what Vince wants happen.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.130
What does Vince want?

21:00.843 --> 21:04.220
ARl: Come on, you don't like "Medellin,"
he doesn't like "Matterhorn. "

21:04.430 --> 21:06.598
Let's just go our
separate ways, come on.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.767
Are you saying
Vince is gonna try to outbid me?

21:08.851 --> 21:10.769
Did you tell this kid how much
fucking money I have?

21:10.853 --> 21:13.146
He doesn't care.
He's fucking crazy.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.689
You're right,
he is fucking crazy.

21:15.691 --> 21:16.983
So where does
that leave us?

21:19.403 --> 21:20.528
I'm not sure.

21:21.197 --> 21:22.822
I have to decide
how crazy I am.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.574
- Joe?
- I'll get back to you, Ari.

21:24.659 --> 21:25.659
Joe.

21:28.579 --> 21:30.622
"Johnny Chase walks
around Hewlett Harbor

21:30.706 --> 21:33.458
with the same vacant eyes
that manned the decks of the Gokstad

21:33.542 --> 21:36.211
in the short-lived, highly glorified
'Viking Quest. "'

21:37.046 --> 21:38.296
They're hitting
my past now too.

21:38.381 --> 21:40.632
You can't do this
to yourself, Johnny.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.342
I'm not doing it
to me, Vince.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.552
The universe is
doing it to me.

21:45.471 --> 21:46.638
That "The Post"?

21:46.722 --> 21:47.681
Yeah.

21:47.765 --> 21:49.057
What does it say?

21:49.266 --> 21:51.226
Fuck this stuff,
Drama.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.311
Not my
hometown paper.

21:53.396 --> 21:55.772
- Johnny.
- No wonder Mom hasn't called me today.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.399
What does it say?

21:57.483 --> 21:58.566
Here.
I can't read it.

21:58.734 --> 21:59.734
Just tell me, E.

22:02.279 --> 22:05.323
The reviewer says he took one star off
his review the minute you came on.

22:08.285 --> 22:09.411
How many stars are left?

22:09.870 --> 22:10.996
None.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.540
That's great.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.042
I get zero stars
in my hometown paper.

22:16.127 --> 22:17.252
Johnny.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.837
Nah, there's nothing
you can say, bro.

22:18.921 --> 22:21.756
You don't know what it's like.
And I'm a realist.

22:22.591 --> 22:25.135
I knew the show had very little chance.
None of 'em do.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.680
But I thought
I did good on this one.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.266
And I tried so hard.

22:32.935 --> 22:35.478
And I thought they'd see that,
but they didn't.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.356
- What the hell is that?
- It's Turtle.

22:38.441 --> 22:40.275
He's got something
that'll cheer you up.

22:40.401 --> 22:41.443
A gun?

22:41.527 --> 22:44.112
Come on, Drama,
you're gonna love this, I swear.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.577
Holy shit.
Wow.

22:50.953 --> 22:52.037
Looks good.

22:52.121 --> 22:54.372
- Yeah? How's this look?
- What's that?

22:54.457 --> 22:56.374
The phone number of
the girl of my dreams.

22:56.459 --> 22:58.334
I can't wait till you guys meet her.
She's amazing.

22:58.461 --> 23:01.713
- She's like me with tits.
- Yeah, it sounds amazing.

23:01.797 --> 23:04.758
So? What
do you think?

23:05.634 --> 23:07.552
I can't believe
you guys did this.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.512
It's only 'cause
we love you, Drama.

23:10.264 --> 23:12.724
Here come
the waterworks.

23:13.476 --> 23:15.018
You know, I've been wanting
to fix this baby up

23:15.102 --> 23:17.604
ever since
I got out here,

23:17.688 --> 23:19.647
but I never
could afford it.

23:21.108 --> 23:23.026
This car
sums up my life

23:23.152 --> 23:25.153
and my career
in a nutshell.

23:25.321 --> 23:27.363
- Johnny...
- Nah, for real, bro.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.825
It's a symbol
of my failures.

23:31.077 --> 23:34.079
And now with another one on my hands,
again I needed my baby brother

23:34.163 --> 23:36.915
to do for me what I could not
do for myself.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.166
Johnny, stop.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.294
I do
appreciate it, guys.

23:41.378 --> 23:44.005
- Drama.
- Come on, wait.

23:45.716 --> 23:46.883
Where you
going, Johnny?

23:47.676 --> 23:49.677
Wherever the road
takes me, Bro.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.979
Nobody went up there
and told you nothin'.

24:00.564 --> 24:02.857
It's not the same anymore.
It's different now.

24:03.526 --> 24:05.110
It ain't just
happening over there

24:05.194 --> 24:06.528
and it ain't just
happenin' over there.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.571
It's happenin' here.
It's happenin' everywhere...

24:08.697 --> 24:10.865
- What do you think?
- It's even better live.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.326
- Shh!
- Fuck reviews.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.661
Oh, fuck 'em.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.205
Not in my town.

24:18.499 --> 24:21.000
Not in any of
my five towns.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.175
Try Johnny again,
Turtle.

24:30.386 --> 24:31.511
That's probably him.

24:32.513 --> 24:33.596
It's Ari.

24:36.016 --> 24:37.016
Whaddaya got,
Ari?

24:37.101 --> 24:39.310
I got Joe Roberts.
He's calling for Vinny.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.187
Joe Roberts
wants to talk to you.

24:41.397 --> 24:42.730
About what?

24:44.066 --> 24:45.567
- Hey, Joe.
- Vince.

24:45.651 --> 24:48.486
- Yeah.
- I was a PA on "Apocalypse Now. "

24:49.738 --> 24:51.906
I watched Francis
almost kill himself

24:51.991 --> 24:55.076
to get that movie made.
I watched him go bankrupt.

24:55.452 --> 24:56.953
I watched him
go mad, nearly.

24:57.705 --> 25:01.332
And I idolized him for it. I never
had the passion.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.501
For me, it was
always about the score.

25:03.961 --> 25:06.754
You seem to have
that passion, Vince.

25:07.423 --> 25:09.924
But if you really don't have it,
or if you can lose it, do.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.342
Don't kill yourself.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.761
At the end of the day,
it's only a movie.

25:14.972 --> 25:16.014
Good luck, Vince.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.308
Hey, Vince.

25:18.601 --> 25:21.227
Ari, I didn't
totally follow that.

25:21.478 --> 25:24.272
The movie is yours.
You got it for $5,000,000.

25:24.648 --> 25:26.858
The studio is into it for more
than twice that,

25:26.942 --> 25:28.193
but they're
gonna settle.

25:28.277 --> 25:31.905
Congratulations. You're the proud owner
of 150 pieces of paper!

25:32.323 --> 25:34.824
- Yeah, Daddy!
- Thank you, Ari.

25:35.284 --> 25:36.367
So what's next?

25:36.452 --> 25:40.163
Next, you come in and you sign those
agency papers. Right, big boy?

25:40.289 --> 25:42.123
Yes. Right, Ari.

25:42.958 --> 25:44.542
And then we
go figure out where

25:44.627 --> 25:47.253
to get the other 70 or so million
dollars to make this movie.

25:47.421 --> 25:48.671
Eh, it's gonna
be easy.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.883
I don't doubt it, Vinny.
Good night.

25:55.137 --> 25:57.138
We got it.

25:57.598 --> 25:59.098
Congrats, buddy.

25:59.266 --> 26:01.059
Now that it's real,
are you sure?

26:01.227 --> 26:03.728
100%. I mean,
how hard can it be to produce?

26:05.231 --> 26:07.148
This shoulda been
a great night.

26:07.775 --> 26:09.025
Try Johnny again,
Turtle.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.647
- Yeah.
Jesus, Johnny,

26:47.731 --> 26:49.732
where the fuck have you been?
I've been calling you all night.

26:49.817 --> 26:52.360
This is not appropriate behavior
for a guy your age.

26:52.653 --> 26:54.821
Sorry, bro, I just needed
a little radio silence.

26:54.989 --> 26:57.365
We all have fucking problems,
but what now?

26:57.533 --> 26:59.367
I'm not getting
breakfast again this morning?

27:00.327 --> 27:02.245
I'll make breakfast
for you, bro.

27:02.371 --> 27:05.206
- Can you wait a little bit?
- What's "a little bit"?

27:07.209 --> 27:08.876
Uh, maybe
eight hours or so?

27:09.044 --> 27:11.546
Johnny, listen, if I have to get Turtle
cooking lessons

27:11.630 --> 27:14.132
because you're not feeling up for it
anymore, I'm gonna need to know.

27:14.216 --> 27:15.508
No, I'm there
for you, bro.

27:15.592 --> 27:19.554
Because I would be shocked
if the star of a major TV show

27:19.638 --> 27:22.056
decides he still wants
to cook his little brother's breakfast.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.809
- Ha ha!
- What are you talking about, Vince?

27:24.893 --> 27:26.227
Tell him, Lloyd.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.229
It's a hit, Johnny Drama,
it's a hit!

27:28.480 --> 27:31.399
16,000,000
viewers.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.485
Tops in the coveted
18-to-49 demo,

27:34.570 --> 27:36.070
built from
your lead in.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.697
Don't fuck
with me, Lloyd.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.699
I am not fucking
with you, Drama.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.367
What about
the reviews?

27:41.660 --> 27:44.454
Fuck the reviews!
The people have spoken,

27:44.538 --> 27:47.874
and you, Johnny "Drama" Chase,
are on a hit TV show!

27:48.083 --> 27:50.668
Congratulations! Way to go!
- Holy fuck.

27:50.753 --> 27:53.546
- Get your ass back. We're hungry!
- I want pancakes!

27:54.214 --> 27:55.798
All right, I'll be there
as soon as I can.

27:55.883 --> 27:56.924
Congratulations,
Johnny!

27:57.009 --> 27:59.927
- Love you, big brother.
- Get back soon. We love you.

28:00.137 --> 28:01.596
I love you guys too.

28:13.609 --> 28:15.026
Thank you, God.

28:15.861 --> 28:17.612
Victory!
