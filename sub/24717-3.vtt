WEBVTT

00:04.271 --> 00:09.241
for how we interact with our
extraterrestrial visitors.

00:09.276 --> 00:11.877
ANDREW COLLINS:
Two, one, let it go!

00:11.912 --> 00:15.914
TRAVIS TAYLOR: We've never found
an official sanctioned document

00:15.950 --> 00:19.852
that says, if we're invaded
by aliens, this is what we do.

00:19.887 --> 00:21.687
Doesn't mean
that there isn't one.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.222
MILTON WAINWRIGHT:
In we go, huh?

00:23.257 --> 00:25.090
DAVID CHILDRESS:
I believe that these protocols

00:25.126 --> 00:27.393
are already established,
and, in fact,

00:27.428 --> 00:30.796
we are already in contact
with extraterrestrials.

00:30.831 --> 00:33.265
COLLINS: What we actually
could be looking at here

00:33.300 --> 00:36.268
is a genuine alien life-form.

00:36.303 --> 00:37.803
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
The question I have is,

00:37.838 --> 00:39.271
what are we gonna do?

00:39.306 --> 00:42.307
♪ ♪

01:08.335 --> 01:12.337
NARRATOR:
October 19, 2017.

01:12.373 --> 01:14.973
The Hawaiian island of Maui.

01:15.009 --> 01:19.845
Here, perched atop
a 10,000-foot summit,

01:19.880 --> 01:22.981
stands
the Haleakala Observatory.

01:23.017 --> 01:26.585
Astronomers using
The Panoramic Survey Telescope

01:26.620 --> 01:28.987
and Rapid Response System,
or Pan-STARRS,

01:29.023 --> 01:32.224
detect a mysterious object

01:32.259 --> 01:34.993
traveling at high speed
through our solar system.

01:38.866 --> 01:42.034
The trajectory of this object
is unlike any

01:42.069 --> 01:44.536
that has ever been seen before.

01:46.373 --> 01:49.541
I was in charge
of coordinating the observing

01:49.577 --> 01:51.610
to characterize the object.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.846
The object was discovered.

01:53.881 --> 01:56.115
And, at that point,
there were images taken

01:56.150 --> 01:58.684
that showed an object
moving rapidly

01:58.719 --> 02:01.653
with respect to the stars.

02:01.689 --> 02:04.323
The stars are individual dots
of light,

02:04.358 --> 02:06.125
and this object was a streak,

02:06.160 --> 02:08.026
so they knew it was moving fast.

02:08.062 --> 02:11.063
At that point,
they started to compute

02:11.098 --> 02:15.167
an orbit to try and understand
what this object was.

02:15.202 --> 02:17.636
This was
a really dramatic difference

02:17.671 --> 02:19.638
from what
had been seen previously.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.476
NARRATOR:
The object was found

02:24.512 --> 02:27.312
to have a highly unusual
hyperbolic orbit,

02:27.348 --> 02:29.214
suggesting that it was traveling

02:29.250 --> 02:31.150
at such a high rate of speed

02:31.185 --> 02:34.086
that it was not being pulled
into a more circular orbit

02:34.121 --> 02:36.155
by the force of gravity.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.691
MEECH:
Everything in the solar system

02:39.727 --> 02:42.261
is either on a circular
or an elliptical orbit.

02:42.296 --> 02:46.231
This was a particularly
exciting observation,

02:46.267 --> 02:48.033
because we had never seen
anything like this

02:48.068 --> 02:49.668
come through the solar system.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.604
NARRATOR:
The object, which was classified

02:52.640 --> 02:55.607
as an asteroid
and named 'Oumuamua,

02:55.643 --> 02:58.744
a Hawaiian word
meaning "scout" or "messenger,"

02:58.779 --> 03:00.846
is the first object of its kind

03:00.881 --> 03:05.217
to be officially recognized
as interstellar.

03:05.252 --> 03:09.188
An asteroid was discovered
coming<i> into</i> our solar system.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.056
Let that sink in.

03:11.091 --> 03:14.193
An asteroid was discovered
coming<i> into</i> our solar system.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.694
From where we don't know.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.863
It just came from outside
our solar system,

03:17.898 --> 03:22.201
meaning it's from a different
star system, somewhere else.

03:22.236 --> 03:25.204
That's historic,
that we've actually seen it.

03:25.239 --> 03:30.142
We now know objects can travel
from one star system to another.

03:30.177 --> 03:33.212
NARRATOR: Researchers
engaged in the Search

03:33.247 --> 03:36.148
for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence, or SETI,

03:36.183 --> 03:38.784
were intrigued not only
by 'Oumuamua's origins,

03:38.819 --> 03:41.987
but also by its unusual shape.

03:42.022 --> 03:43.388
SETH SHOSTAK:
It had a very funny shape.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.290
It's shaped like a cigar.

03:45.326 --> 03:48.660
You know, it's maybe five or ten
times as long as it is across.

03:48.696 --> 03:52.397
No asteroid that we know of
looks like a cigar.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.932
Inevitably,
there were people saying,

03:53.968 --> 03:55.500
"Well, are you sure it's a rock?

03:55.536 --> 03:57.002
"Maybe there's somebody
inside this thing.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.437
Maybe they've come to visit."

03:58.472 --> 04:01.073
TAYLOR:
Now, if I were gonna build

04:01.108 --> 04:03.642
a spaceship that was gonna take
hundreds of years,

04:03.677 --> 04:05.844
or maybe thousands
or millions of years to go

04:05.879 --> 04:08.347
from one star to another,
I would start by finding

04:08.382 --> 04:11.416
a big asteroid that I like,
that had all the minerals on it.

04:11.452 --> 04:14.953
And I would use that and just
turn it into the ship I wanted.

04:14.989 --> 04:19.157
NARRATOR: Mainstream astronomers
such as Avi Loeb, the chair

04:19.193 --> 04:22.261
of Harvard University's
astronomy department,

04:22.296 --> 04:25.264
noted that the cigar shape
of 'Oumuamua

04:25.299 --> 04:29.801
is the optimal design for a
vessel to travel through space.

04:29.837 --> 04:32.004
This has led
ancient astronaut theorists

04:32.039 --> 04:34.940
and even some astronomers
to question

04:34.975 --> 04:37.709
if the so-called asteroid
is actually

04:37.745 --> 04:41.113
an extraterrestrial vessel.

04:41.148 --> 04:46.285
What I think is interesting is
that 'Oumuamua is cigar-shaped.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.321
Because there are stories

04:49.356 --> 04:53.492
and eyewitness reports
of cigar-shaped UFOs.

04:53.527 --> 04:56.895
So is it possible that there
is some type of a connection?

04:56.930 --> 05:00.532
NARRATOR: Reports of strange,
cigar-shaped UFOs

05:00.567 --> 05:03.001
date back hundreds of years.

05:03.037 --> 05:07.339
This famous woodcut from 1561,
for example,

05:07.374 --> 05:10.409
is based on a firsthand account
by someone

05:10.444 --> 05:13.679
who claimed that a number
of round and tubular objects

05:13.714 --> 05:16.014
could be seen battling
in the sky

05:16.050 --> 05:18.517
over the town
of Nuremberg, Germany.

05:20.521 --> 05:24.056
This first documented UFO
photograph captured

05:24.091 --> 05:26.591
what looks like a long,
cylindrical craft

05:26.627 --> 05:31.330
hovering over Mount Washington,
New Hampshire in 1870.

05:31.365 --> 05:35.867
And in modern times, sightings
of cigar-shaped UFOs

05:35.903 --> 05:39.237
are commonly reported,
as are those which are described

05:39.273 --> 05:42.941
as so-called "flying saucers."

05:42.976 --> 05:46.912
CHILDRESS:
It is possible that an asteroid

05:46.947 --> 05:50.349
has been taken, hollowed out,

05:50.384 --> 05:52.918
made into a spaceship,

05:52.953 --> 05:56.655
and then put into
a special orbit or trajectory.

05:56.690 --> 06:02.094
And what might be inside of
'Oumuamua is anyone's guess.

06:02.129 --> 06:05.397
TSOUKALOS:
Discoveries like 'Oumuamua

06:05.432 --> 06:08.300
certainly have swayed
the scientific community

06:08.335 --> 06:10.469
towards our ideas,

06:10.504 --> 06:13.638
because for the first time
in my life

06:13.674 --> 06:17.109
have I heard an astronomer say
that this object

06:17.144 --> 06:19.911
that is floating through
our solar system right now,

06:19.947 --> 06:22.714
may be
an extraterrestrial craft.

06:22.750 --> 06:26.218
That doesn't come from me;
it comes from an astronomer.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.620
WILLIAM HENRY: Maybe 'Oumuamua
was a false alarm,

06:28.655 --> 06:30.655
but maybe it was the real thing.

06:30.691 --> 06:33.458
However, it does inform us
that we need a protocol.

06:33.494 --> 06:36.094
We need steps in place
that will help us

06:36.130 --> 06:38.630
to determine what we
are actually seeing

06:38.665 --> 06:40.399
and what the response should be.

06:40.434 --> 06:43.168
This was a tremendous wake-up
call, because it started

06:43.203 --> 06:45.904
to give us a sense
of how would we respond

06:45.939 --> 06:48.607
if there were such
an intrusion, if you will.

06:48.642 --> 06:52.677
NARRATOR: Does humanity have a
plan for what to do in the event

06:52.713 --> 06:55.847
that a spacecraft carrying
extraterrestrial beings

06:55.883 --> 06:58.083
comes to our planet?

06:58.118 --> 07:01.953
And, if so,
what are the protocols?

07:01.989 --> 07:05.991
And who is responsible
for implementing them?

07:06.026 --> 07:09.428
PAUL DAVIES: The International
Academy of Astronautics

07:09.463 --> 07:12.764
set up something called
the Post Detection Task Group,

07:12.800 --> 07:16.134
and I chaired that
for some years.

07:16.170 --> 07:19.337
And it was just an informal,
uh, collection of people

07:19.373 --> 07:22.607
who, uh, whose job was
to simply deliberate on

07:22.643 --> 07:25.444
if there should be some
sort of putative signal,

07:25.479 --> 07:28.280
or detection
of alien technology, what next?

07:28.315 --> 07:29.481
What do we do?
Who do we tell?

07:29.516 --> 07:30.982
How do we respond?

07:31.018 --> 07:33.518
What would the impact be
on society?

07:33.554 --> 07:36.154
NARRATOR:
In 1989,

07:36.190 --> 07:39.958
the International Academy of
Astronautics, working with SETI,

07:39.993 --> 07:43.395
published the "Declaration of
Principles Concerning Activities

07:43.430 --> 07:48.400
Following the Detection of
Extraterrestrial Intelligence."

07:48.435 --> 07:52.571
It stated that if proof of
an alien presence is confirmed,

07:52.606 --> 07:56.508
the next consideration should be
to decide which government

07:56.543 --> 07:59.544
or scientific entity should
begin communication,

07:59.580 --> 08:02.347
so that the situation
does not quickly turn

08:02.382 --> 08:05.517
into an international
free-for-all.

08:05.552 --> 08:08.186
The SETI protocols, however,

08:08.222 --> 08:12.424
are only binding on the
astronomical community.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.726
There are many more players
in the equation.

08:14.761 --> 08:17.095
The SETI protocols
may cover astronomers,

08:17.130 --> 08:19.331
but they don't cover governments

08:19.366 --> 08:21.333
and they're not even
legally binding.

08:21.368 --> 08:25.904
DAVIES: Nobody can tell a radio
astronomer, or anybody else,

08:25.939 --> 08:27.906
that they're not allowed
to transmit.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.342
And even if the United States

08:30.377 --> 08:32.110
and other major nations decided

08:32.145 --> 08:34.112
that there should be some sort

08:34.147 --> 08:37.249
of moratorium on using radio
telescopes for that purpose,

08:37.284 --> 08:39.217
there's nothing
to prevent North Korea,

08:39.253 --> 08:40.719
for example, from doing it.

08:40.754 --> 08:44.055
I think it's totally
"unpoliceable,"

08:44.091 --> 08:46.925
which is why we have to think
through rather carefully

08:46.960 --> 08:49.060
what the consequences would be,

08:49.096 --> 08:52.464
in the event that there was
this exciting discovery.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.902
NARRATOR: Considering
the enormous global impact

08:56.937 --> 09:00.572
of any first communication
or contact between someone

09:00.607 --> 09:04.543
from Earth and an intelligent
being from another planet,

09:04.578 --> 09:07.746
wouldn't world governments
already have their own protocols

09:07.781 --> 09:10.582
in place to handle
such a situation?

09:10.617 --> 09:14.452
Protocols that would govern--
not just individual countries--

09:14.488 --> 09:18.089
but everyone in the world?

09:18.125 --> 09:21.393
TAYLOR: I spent the better part
of about four years researching,

09:21.428 --> 09:23.929
uh, a book that myself
and, uh, and some colleagues

09:23.964 --> 09:27.933
were working on
to create a protocol:

09:27.968 --> 09:31.136
if we were invaded by aliens,
what would we do?

09:31.171 --> 09:34.105
And we searched
everywhere we could,

09:34.141 --> 09:36.942
and we had several databases
available to us,

09:36.977 --> 09:38.777
and we've never found

09:38.812 --> 09:41.246
an official sanctioned
government document

09:41.281 --> 09:45.417
that says if we're invaded
by aliens, this is what we do.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.786
Doesn't mean
that there isn't one.

09:47.821 --> 09:52.257
POPE: With my experience of the
British Ministry of Defence,

09:52.292 --> 09:55.594
I'd be surprised if there wasn't
a protocol for this.

09:55.629 --> 09:59.798
So I suspect that somewhere,
deep in the bowels

09:59.833 --> 10:02.667
of the Ministry of Defence
and the Department of Defense,

10:02.703 --> 10:04.636
there is a plan.

10:04.671 --> 10:08.306
But I also suspect
that it's highly classified.

10:10.811 --> 10:14.212
NARRATOR: But while many of the
world's top governments continue

10:14.247 --> 10:17.649
to deny the existence
of any plans or protocols

10:17.684 --> 10:19.451
that would be used in the event

10:19.486 --> 10:21.653
of an extraterrestrial
encounter,

10:21.688 --> 10:24.356
many ancient astronaut
theorists believe

10:24.391 --> 10:27.192
that not only do
such plans exist,

10:27.227 --> 10:29.127
but that they have been
in place for decades.

10:29.162 --> 10:33.498
And that contact
between Earth governments

10:33.533 --> 10:36.034
and extraterrestrial visitors
has been happening--

10:36.069 --> 10:38.737
in secret--
for thousands of years.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.244
TAYLOR:
One of these videos

10:46.279 --> 10:50.281
The<i> New York Times </i>
publishes a bombshell story.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.350
It reveals the existence

10:52.386 --> 10:55.220
of a $22 million
black budget program

10:55.255 --> 10:57.122
within the Pentagon

10:57.157 --> 11:01.359
created to investigate whether
unidentified flying objects

11:01.395 --> 11:04.529
pose a threat
to national security.

11:04.564 --> 11:07.932
From 2007 until 2012,

11:07.968 --> 11:11.302
the Advanced Aerospace
Threat Identification Program

11:11.338 --> 11:14.239
collected a compilation
of videos

11:14.274 --> 11:16.574
that show inexplicable
aerial phenomena,

11:16.610 --> 11:19.911
some of which have been released
to the public.

11:19.946 --> 11:22.380
TAYLOR:
One of these videos, at least,

11:22.416 --> 11:26.284
comes from the gun camera
of an F-18.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.386
And you don't just jump out
in your plane

11:28.422 --> 11:30.789
and fly out and chase something
because you saw it go by.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.490
You were told to do so,

11:32.526 --> 11:36.061
and it took a lot of people
to know this was going on.

11:36.096 --> 11:40.131
NARRATOR: Although the complete
findings of the program

11:40.167 --> 11:42.801
otherwise known as AATIP
are still considered

11:42.836 --> 11:45.570
highly classified
and may never be released,

11:45.605 --> 11:48.807
its very existence
provides proof

11:48.842 --> 11:52.143
that the United States military
had protocols in place

11:52.179 --> 11:55.480
for how to investigate
unidentified flying objects.

11:55.515 --> 11:58.483
But do the videos
imply something else?

11:58.518 --> 12:02.353
Something of even greater
significance?

12:02.389 --> 12:03.822
Could they be evidence

12:03.857 --> 12:05.590
not only that UFOs exist,

12:05.625 --> 12:07.759
but that the government

12:07.794 --> 12:09.127
has been studying them

12:09.162 --> 12:12.163
and not shooting them down
for a reason?

12:14.234 --> 12:17.635
TAYLOR: We simulate
all sorts of scenarios

12:17.671 --> 12:20.004
in war gaming simulations.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.372
I've seen these simulations

12:21.408 --> 12:24.109
where they can teleport
their soldiers

12:24.144 --> 12:26.444
from one place to another
instantaneously.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.046
Or they have shields

12:28.081 --> 12:31.983
that keep anything below
extremely high-caliber weapons

12:32.018 --> 12:33.618
from penetrating their armor.

12:33.653 --> 12:36.688
A lot of times this is called
an engagement for 2075.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.656
Now, think about that.

12:38.692 --> 12:40.625
We can prepare and plan

12:40.660 --> 12:44.195
for engagements against forces
in the future.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.831
That's almost like preparing
for a force

12:46.867 --> 12:49.300
that's just that much
more advanced than us.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.703
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

12:51.738 --> 12:53.805
that by gathering
and then studying evidence

12:53.840 --> 12:56.007
of UFO activity,

12:56.042 --> 12:58.510
the U.S. military
is developing protocols

12:58.545 --> 13:00.812
which will prepare
future soldiers

13:00.847 --> 13:02.647
to face what could be

13:02.682 --> 13:05.083
extraterrestrial forces?

13:05.118 --> 13:08.319
And if not here on Earth,
on other planets?

13:08.355 --> 13:10.822
We've got to have
space capabilities.

13:10.857 --> 13:13.658
We've got to be able
to run out into our vehicle,

13:13.693 --> 13:15.493
turn it on,
and fly up into space.

13:15.529 --> 13:19.831
Right now it takes months
to prepare to go into space.

13:19.866 --> 13:21.533
We need to have bases
on the Moon

13:21.568 --> 13:23.234
and on Mars and Europa,

13:23.270 --> 13:25.603
various other places
in the solar system

13:25.639 --> 13:30.041
so that we don't have to play
on one staging ground: Earth.

13:30.076 --> 13:33.211
We can't fight
wearing a space suit.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.780
We're gonna have to have
some other type

13:35.816 --> 13:38.783
of environment capability,
like powered armor suits,

13:38.819 --> 13:41.853
like in<i> Iron Man, </i>
that improves your abilities

13:41.888 --> 13:43.254
instead of hinders them.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.690
So we need some other technology
for that.

13:45.725 --> 13:49.194
NARRATOR: But if
the United States military

13:49.229 --> 13:51.796
has secret protocols
for how to identify

13:51.832 --> 13:55.033
and combat
extraterrestrial threats,

13:55.068 --> 13:59.537
could they also have protocols
for more peaceful encounters?

13:59.573 --> 14:02.707
And if so, could these protocols
also be part

14:02.742 --> 14:06.077
of a global strategy,
one secretly shared

14:06.112 --> 14:09.948
with other nations
around the world?

14:13.253 --> 14:17.622
Vatican City, May 2014.

14:17.657 --> 14:21.926
In a sermon dedicated
to concepts of inclusion,

14:21.962 --> 14:24.963
Pope Francis shocks his
congregation when he declares

14:24.998 --> 14:28.733
that if alien life-forms
ever arrive on Earth,

14:28.768 --> 14:32.604
he would welcome them
into the Catholic Church.

14:32.639 --> 14:36.774
The pontiff's remarks
stun the world,

14:36.810 --> 14:39.677
as it is the first time
that a sitting pope acknowledges

14:39.713 --> 14:42.914
not only that
extraterrestrial life exists,

14:42.949 --> 14:44.916
but that it could be intelligent

14:44.951 --> 14:48.353
and capable
of interplanetary travel.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.054
JONATHAN YOUNG:
The Pope's action

14:50.090 --> 14:55.126
is one little example
of the broad shift in attitudes

14:55.161 --> 14:57.862
toward the possibility
of visitation.

14:57.898 --> 15:00.198
RABBI ARIEL BAR TZADOK:
Religious authorities

15:00.233 --> 15:03.368
around the world,
leaders of the world religions

15:03.403 --> 15:06.671
are having to deal
with the possibility,

15:06.706 --> 15:09.340
if not the already known
reality,

15:09.376 --> 15:12.010
of the existence
of extraterrestrial beings.

15:12.045 --> 15:15.046
NARRATOR:
Whether a secretly held belief

15:15.081 --> 15:17.849
or a recently evolved position,

15:17.884 --> 15:21.152
faith-based organizations
around the globe

15:21.187 --> 15:22.620
have recently embraced
a more open

15:22.656 --> 15:25.290
and transparent view
that intelligent life

15:25.325 --> 15:28.192
beyond Earth is possible.

15:28.228 --> 15:29.794
The Catholic Church's statements

15:29.829 --> 15:33.131
are allied with the statements
of the Dalai Lama,

15:33.166 --> 15:36.367
who has recently been talking
about openness and oneness

15:36.403 --> 15:39.003
and the sameness of all
the creatures in creation,

15:39.039 --> 15:40.338
that we shouldn't treat

15:40.373 --> 15:43.041
extraterrestrial beings
as strangers,

15:43.076 --> 15:45.243
but rather as similar to us.

15:45.278 --> 15:49.047
TZADOK:
When they will encounter us

15:49.082 --> 15:51.749
or we will encounter them,

15:51.785 --> 15:54.485
it does not have to be conflict

15:54.521 --> 15:57.822
if we do not allow it to be so.

15:59.859 --> 16:02.660
NARRATOR: As far as
ancient astronaut theorists

16:02.696 --> 16:05.229
are concerned, the willingness
of world religions

16:05.265 --> 16:07.231
to embrace the notion
of visitations

16:07.267 --> 16:10.034
by extraterrestrial beings
is not new

16:10.070 --> 16:14.172
but dates back hundreds,
if not thousands, of years.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.841
They argue that most religions,

16:16.876 --> 16:19.877
if not all,
are based on the idea

16:19.913 --> 16:24.115
that not only do
otherworldly beings exist,

16:24.150 --> 16:26.451
but that their purpose
in coming to Earth

16:26.486 --> 16:29.754
has been to provide everything
from spiritual enlightenment

16:29.789 --> 16:31.756
to scientific knowledge.

16:33.626 --> 16:37.061
HENRY:
In 1999, NASA published a study

16:37.097 --> 16:41.299
called "The Societal
Implications of Astrobiology."

16:41.334 --> 16:44.235
What this study
was designed to do at its core

16:44.270 --> 16:48.573
was evaluate the impact
of disclosure on religion.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.909
NASA views religion
as an adaptive tool

16:51.945 --> 16:54.712
that can help people
to answer questions

16:54.748 --> 16:56.881
that science can't answer

16:56.916 --> 16:58.950
because, in their view,
religion has been dealing

16:58.985 --> 17:00.952
with extraterrestrials
for a long time.

17:00.987 --> 17:05.123
People have been told to have
faith in otherworldly beings.

17:05.158 --> 17:06.758
All of the major religions

17:06.793 --> 17:09.994
have prophecies
of the return of a Christ,

17:10.030 --> 17:12.630
a messiah, a savior figure.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.333
And very often
these returns involve

17:15.368 --> 17:17.101
what appear to be,
in the description,

17:17.137 --> 17:21.005
some method
of cosmic transportation.

17:21.041 --> 17:24.342
TZADOK: The Messiah comes
with an army of angels.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.011
And the angels we know
from biblical definition

17:27.047 --> 17:30.148
are certainly not human
by any standards.

17:30.183 --> 17:33.951
They are by every standard
of definition extraterrestrial.

17:33.987 --> 17:38.923
CHILDRESS: The shock
of extraterrestrials being here

17:38.958 --> 17:40.658
and having been here
for thousands of years

17:40.693 --> 17:43.261
will really change society.

17:43.296 --> 17:46.697
Eventually, everyone
on planet Earth will realize

17:46.733 --> 17:49.333
that we are not alone.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.436
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

17:51.471 --> 17:53.704
that the religious concept
of a messiah

17:53.740 --> 17:56.941
who returns to Earth
for the betterment of mankind

17:56.976 --> 18:00.211
was based on a message
given to our ancestors

18:00.246 --> 18:03.147
by otherworldly beings?

18:03.183 --> 18:06.717
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe

18:06.753 --> 18:09.854
that the answer
is a resounding yes

18:09.889 --> 18:12.957
and that not only
was such a visitation promised,

18:12.992 --> 18:15.026
but that it is
already occurring.

18:15.061 --> 18:17.061
(buzzing)

18:20.700 --> 18:23.868
WAINWRIGHT:
We have lots of evidence

18:23.903 --> 18:26.737
Author and researcher
Andrew Collins

18:26.773 --> 18:28.739
travels to Sheffield, England,

18:28.775 --> 18:31.642
to witness
a remarkable demonstration.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.411
-Hi, guys.
-Hello.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.579
-Andrew, how are you?
-Ah, Chris.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.680
-Pleasure.
-I'm Milton.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.048
NARRATOR:
He is meeting

18:37.083 --> 18:40.151
with microbiologist
Milton Wainwright

18:40.186 --> 18:41.686
and engineer Chris Rose,

18:41.721 --> 18:45.022
two members of the research team
who are convinced

18:45.058 --> 18:48.025
that life on Earth
may have originated in space

18:48.061 --> 18:51.062
through a process
known as panspermia,

18:51.097 --> 18:55.766
a theory that dates as far back
as the fifth century BC.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.703
According to the theory,
microbial life

18:58.738 --> 19:01.839
is capable of traveling
through the universe

19:01.875 --> 19:06.577
and may on occasion survive
entry into Earth's atmosphere.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.246
I understand you've made

19:08.281 --> 19:09.447
some incredible discoveries.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.681
Please tell me all about it.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.884
WAINWRIGHT:
In the early 2000s, my colleague

19:12.919 --> 19:14.385
Chandra Wickramasinghe,

19:14.420 --> 19:17.121
um, we were launching balloons
from India.

19:17.157 --> 19:20.691
And these were sampling the air
at 41 kilometers.

19:20.727 --> 19:23.127
And they showed that organisms

19:23.163 --> 19:25.263
are continually arriving
all the time.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.965
Panspermia
is extremely simple idea.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.768
Basically, it's the idea
that life came from space.

19:30.803 --> 19:34.105
Instead of being formed on this
planet, it came from space.

19:34.140 --> 19:36.941
My findings
relate to panspermia simply,

19:36.976 --> 19:39.243
and they show
that organisms are coming in

19:39.279 --> 19:41.112
at this very moment from space.

19:41.147 --> 19:44.582
Tell me how you actually collect
these samples.

19:44.617 --> 19:45.983
This is our, our balloon

19:46.019 --> 19:48.152
that's gonna give us
the buoyancy from the...

19:48.188 --> 19:49.987
the hydrogen gas here.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.556
Now, our capture mechanism
is right here.

19:51.591 --> 19:52.590
Let me show you this.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.126
This exposes little metal stubs

19:55.161 --> 19:56.561
to the environment.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.129
And you're looking

19:58.164 --> 19:59.897
to see if you can get microbes

19:59.933 --> 20:02.233
coming from the upper atmosphere

20:02.268 --> 20:04.135
-and not from the Earth itself?
-WAINWRIGHT: That's right.

20:04.170 --> 20:05.736
All the critics say
they're coming from Earth

20:05.772 --> 20:07.338
because we're surrounded
by life.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.440
But we have lots of evidence
that this material

20:09.475 --> 20:10.841
is not coming from Earth.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.810
It's incoming from space.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.245
I mean, it sounds incredible.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.846
I mean, have you ever lost
any of these?

20:15.882 --> 20:17.615
-No, and we're not
about to start today.
-(laughs)

20:17.650 --> 20:19.750
-So fingers crossed, guys.
-Brilliant.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.319
NARRATOR:
The team moves the balloon

20:21.354 --> 20:23.688
into launch position,
from which it will ascend

20:23.723 --> 20:28.192
more than 37 kilometers,
or 23 miles, into the air.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.127
ROSE:
Okay, guys. Ready?

20:30.163 --> 20:32.163
-Andrew, on you.
Countdown, please.
-COLLINS: Okay.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.966
Five, four, three,

20:35.001 --> 20:36.434
two, one.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.502
Let it go! Oh, there it goes.

20:40.406 --> 20:43.674
NARRATOR: Once the balloon
reaches its target altitude

20:43.710 --> 20:45.710
within the Earth's stratosphere,

20:45.745 --> 20:49.046
the capture mechanism
will hopefully collect samples

20:49.082 --> 20:52.617
of non-Earth-based
microbial life.

20:52.652 --> 20:55.019
After the sampling is complete,

20:55.054 --> 20:57.288
the balloon bursts,

20:57.323 --> 20:59.890
and the capture mechanism
descends back to Earth

20:59.926 --> 21:03.060
under the safety of a parachute.

21:03.096 --> 21:06.497
The team uses GPS tracking
to locate

21:06.532 --> 21:08.165
where the mechanism lands.

21:08.201 --> 21:11.135
Once retrieved,
the sample is quickly secured

21:11.170 --> 21:12.803
in a sealed container

21:12.839 --> 21:15.039
so that it does not
become contaminated

21:15.074 --> 21:17.375
with microbes from Earth.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.481
Moments later,

21:23.516 --> 21:26.083
Andrew joins Milton and Chris
at a nearby laboratory.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.752
Here they will extract

21:27.787 --> 21:30.321
the microbes
inside a sterilized clean room

21:30.356 --> 21:31.656
and then analyze them

21:31.691 --> 21:33.224
to make sure no Earth microbes

21:33.259 --> 21:36.394
have contaminated the sample.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.062
COLLINS:
A clean room.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.930
-Mm-hmm.
-How can you ensure

21:39.966 --> 21:41.198
the sterilization?

21:41.234 --> 21:42.667
What are the protocols

21:42.702 --> 21:44.769
-behind this process?
-Right.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.204
It's really all about
sterilizing the air inside,

21:47.240 --> 21:50.374
to make sure the air inside
contains no microorganisms.

21:50.410 --> 21:53.411
So all the air is filtered.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.846
♪ ♪

22:03.022 --> 22:04.755
(speaking indistinctly)

22:08.494 --> 22:11.595
NARRATOR: Milton and Chris
remove the carbon tabs

22:11.631 --> 22:12.963
from the capture mechanism

22:12.999 --> 22:16.534
and place them
into vacuum-sealed containers.

22:16.569 --> 22:19.603
This will further prevent
contamination while they view

22:19.639 --> 22:22.740
the samples with
a scanning electron microscope.

22:26.612 --> 22:28.813
COLLINS:
Wow. What on earth is that?

22:28.848 --> 22:31.315
I can tell
that this is biological.

22:31.351 --> 22:33.784
If you analyze this,
I'm pretty certain

22:33.820 --> 22:36.053
this will show
as carbon, oxygen,

22:36.089 --> 22:37.955
and a little bit of nitrogen.

22:37.990 --> 22:40.591
Now, that's the signature
for life.

22:40.626 --> 22:42.893
COLLINS:
We're saying that this piece

22:42.929 --> 22:44.829
of biological life could

22:44.864 --> 22:47.898
-potentially be extraterrestrial
in origin?
-Right.

22:47.934 --> 22:50.901
There's nothing from Earth
around it. It's pristine.

22:50.937 --> 22:52.803
So it's incoming.

22:52.839 --> 22:55.406
Now, if we do a bit of,
um, modeling studies,

22:55.441 --> 22:57.808
we come to the conclusion
that nothing bigger

22:57.844 --> 22:59.443
than six microns

22:59.479 --> 23:00.845
can go out.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.413
And this is 200.

23:02.448 --> 23:04.982
So it's a very large particle,

23:05.017 --> 23:07.284
and it's coming in.

23:07.320 --> 23:09.286
What we actually could be
looking at here

23:09.322 --> 23:12.523
is a genuine alien life-form?

23:12.558 --> 23:14.458
What you're looking at there

23:14.494 --> 23:16.594
is an organism
or a clump of organisms

23:16.629 --> 23:19.930
that is incoming
from space to Earth.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.601
Nothing bigger than six microns

23:23.636 --> 23:26.604
can go from the surface
of the Earth

23:26.639 --> 23:28.806
to these altitudes
that we sample at.

23:28.841 --> 23:31.542
And yet we are finding particles

23:31.577 --> 23:34.111
all the way up to 200.

23:34.147 --> 23:36.213
They can't be coming up
from Earth.

23:36.249 --> 23:37.615
Absolutely amazing.

23:37.650 --> 23:38.849
It's blown my head off.

23:38.885 --> 23:41.685
NARRATOR:
Biological organisms

23:41.721 --> 23:45.456
not from Earth
but from somewhere in space?

23:45.491 --> 23:47.858
Could we be looking
at actual evidence

23:47.894 --> 23:51.495
of a living organism
from a world other than our own?

23:51.531 --> 23:53.497
COLLINS:
We've actually found

23:53.533 --> 23:55.232
evidence of what could be

23:55.268 --> 23:59.537
extraterrestrial
biological entities.

23:59.572 --> 24:03.374
To see those images
was extraordinary,

24:03.409 --> 24:06.710
and it's convinced me
that the Earth

24:06.746 --> 24:10.714
is surrounded by life
that almost certainly came

24:10.750 --> 24:13.017
from outer space.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.152
This is one we took earlier,
as they say.

24:17.190 --> 24:20.758
This is the most amazing image
I've ever seen in my life.

24:20.793 --> 24:23.027
It's got biological material
here.

24:23.062 --> 24:25.362
And this material
we know contains

24:25.398 --> 24:27.331
carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen.

24:27.366 --> 24:29.667
So this is biological.

24:29.702 --> 24:32.570
When we analyzed the ball,
we found it contained titanium

24:32.605 --> 24:34.205
and a small amount of vanadium.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.407
So this is a titanium sphere

24:36.442 --> 24:38.576
with life inside
and life on the outside.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.177
Now, what on earth is it?

24:40.213 --> 24:44.949
One possibility is that
this is directed panspermia.

24:44.984 --> 24:49.553
Some civilization has put
biological material

24:49.589 --> 24:51.889
inside and just on the outside
of this thing

24:51.924 --> 24:53.757
and they've spewed it out.

24:53.793 --> 24:56.026
And this suggests
that some alien

24:56.062 --> 24:58.529
civilization is seeding planets.

24:58.564 --> 25:02.933
This smoking gun
of, uh, panspermia

25:02.969 --> 25:05.035
or even directed panspermia

25:05.071 --> 25:08.038
could give us
the best evidence yet

25:08.074 --> 25:11.609
that aliens, in some form,

25:11.644 --> 25:14.345
seeded life on this Earth,

25:14.380 --> 25:16.881
which is an incredible thought.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.584
NASA have, uh,

25:20.620 --> 25:24.455
a department known as the Office
of Planetary Protection

25:24.490 --> 25:27.224
-to safeguard, uh, the Earth
-Right.

25:27.260 --> 25:29.793
from extraterrestrial
biological entities--

25:29.829 --> 25:32.029
-whatever you want
to call them--
-Yeah.

25:32.064 --> 25:35.966
from actually penetrating
into the Earth's atmosphere.

25:38.337 --> 25:43.107
There are extremely detailed
plans and protocols

25:43.142 --> 25:45.843
for bringing back any probe

25:45.878 --> 25:49.346
that we send to another planet
or moon

25:49.382 --> 25:50.814
or asteroid.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.983
COLLINS:
The protocols that are in place

25:53.019 --> 25:58.022
shut out the possibility
of us studying

25:58.057 --> 26:01.625
actual biological entities
that may exist

26:01.661 --> 26:04.995
on the edge
of our own stratosphere

26:05.031 --> 26:07.998
that have arrived here
from deep space themself.

26:08.034 --> 26:11.468
Uh, and I find that very sad,
very tragic.

26:11.504 --> 26:13.470
NARRATOR:
If extraterrestrial microbes

26:13.506 --> 26:15.339
are landing on our planet,

26:15.374 --> 26:18.776
can NASA's strict protocols
really protect us

26:18.811 --> 26:21.512
from biological contamination?

26:21.547 --> 26:24.181
Or could it be
that the contamination

26:24.216 --> 26:26.283
is not only unstoppable

26:26.319 --> 26:28.118
but it is the very method

26:28.154 --> 26:30.754
by which life on Earth
began to evolve

26:30.790 --> 26:33.791
millions of years ago?

26:36.862 --> 26:40.264
NARRATOR:
October 4, 1957.

26:40.366 --> 26:43.400
The Soviet Union launches
Sputnik 1,

26:43.502 --> 26:46.804
the first satellite
to orbit the Earth.

26:46.906 --> 26:49.540
Its success stunned the world

26:49.642 --> 26:52.843
and shocked the United States
into action.

26:52.945 --> 26:55.846
The space race was on.

26:55.948 --> 26:59.083
And with it
came the creation of NASA,

26:59.185 --> 27:02.219
the government's first
fully funded agency charged

27:02.321 --> 27:04.955
with not only putting humans
into space

27:05.057 --> 27:09.360
but to have a man land
on the Moon by 1969.

27:09.462 --> 27:12.963
In fact,
so thorough was NASA's focus

27:13.065 --> 27:15.966
on all aspects
of space exploration

27:16.068 --> 27:18.769
that it commissioned a study
on "the implications

27:18.871 --> 27:21.905
of a discovery
of extraterrestrial life,"

27:22.008 --> 27:26.110
otherwise known
as the Brookings Report.

27:26.212 --> 27:29.813
POPE: The Brookings Institute
report didn't just ask,

27:29.915 --> 27:31.348
are there aliens out there?

27:31.450 --> 27:33.417
It took it to the next level
and said,

27:33.519 --> 27:35.386
what happens when we find them?

27:35.488 --> 27:38.122
The implications

27:38.224 --> 27:42.326
of discovering extraterrestrial
life are profound,

27:42.428 --> 27:46.997
and they're implications that go
across all levels of society.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.266
Politics, economics,

27:49.368 --> 27:52.269
religion, technology, science.

27:52.371 --> 27:55.072
Everything will be affected.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.341
MIKE BARA: The Brookings Report
specifically says

27:57.443 --> 27:59.043
you should release information,

27:59.145 --> 28:01.311
little by little, bit by bit,

28:01.414 --> 28:03.514
so that people
get culturally acclimated

28:03.616 --> 28:06.183
to the idea of aliens
and extraterrestrials.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.052
GEORGE NOORY:
We've always speculated,

28:08.154 --> 28:10.120
those of us in broadcasting,

28:10.222 --> 28:11.889
why isn't government
coming forward,

28:11.991 --> 28:14.358
telling us what's going on,
telling us the truth?

28:14.460 --> 28:17.161
And a lot of people cite
the old Brookings Report

28:17.263 --> 28:20.364
that basically said
we can't handle the truth.

28:20.466 --> 28:22.099
There'd be mass chaos.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.101
Religions would collapse.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.836
Governments would collapse.

28:25.938 --> 28:28.138
So the government has decided,

28:28.240 --> 28:30.207
we're not saying anything.

28:30.309 --> 28:33.210
NARRATOR: Does the existence
of the Brookings Report

28:33.312 --> 28:36.013
provide evidence that not only

28:36.115 --> 28:38.749
does the United States
have protocols and procedures

28:38.851 --> 28:42.753
in place in the event
of extraterrestrial contact

28:42.855 --> 28:45.956
but that such protocols have
deliberately been kept a secret

28:46.058 --> 28:49.359
from the American public
for nearly 60 years?

28:49.462 --> 28:51.995
But if so, why?

28:52.098 --> 28:56.266
I do not believe
that government, essentially,

28:56.368 --> 28:59.937
is negative, evil and harmful,
deceptive or lying.

29:00.039 --> 29:02.806
We should look back to 1938,

29:02.908 --> 29:07.010
when Orson Welles did his famous
radio program on Halloween night

29:07.113 --> 29:08.846
called<i> War of the Worlds,</i>

29:08.948 --> 29:11.181
wherein which,
through an enactment,

29:11.283 --> 29:13.550
New York was to be invaded.

29:13.652 --> 29:17.554
People around the country
listening to this radio program

29:17.656 --> 29:19.356
were terrified.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.091
COMMANDER (over radio): The
machines are close together now,

29:21.193 --> 29:22.359
and we're ready to attack.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.795
Planes circling,
ready to strike.

29:24.897 --> 29:28.132
TZADOK: Our government's
learned from this.

29:28.234 --> 29:31.201
People will panic.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.937
JOHN PODESTA:
Some people have thought that

29:34.039 --> 29:36.340
it's important
to-to prepare the public.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.008
You know,
I've always said I think

29:38.110 --> 29:39.943
the American public
can handle the truth.

29:40.045 --> 29:43.147
The government would do well
to be more open

29:43.249 --> 29:45.215
about what it's done
in the past,

29:45.317 --> 29:47.151
what it learned in the past,

29:47.253 --> 29:50.287
what it's doing today, uh,
and what it'll do in the future.

29:50.389 --> 29:53.490
NARRATOR: But while the U.S.
government does not acknowledge

29:53.592 --> 29:56.426
having any official protocols
for first contact,

29:56.529 --> 29:59.363
it makes no secret
of its ongoing efforts

29:59.465 --> 30:04.401
to explore the possibilities of
extraterrestrial communication.

30:06.272 --> 30:08.605
Cape Canaveral, Florida.

30:08.707 --> 30:13.243
September 5, 1977.

30:13.345 --> 30:16.847
NASA launches
the Voyager 1 probe.

30:16.949 --> 30:20.117
Its mission is to journey
to Jupiter, Saturn,

30:20.219 --> 30:24.855
Uranus, and Neptune and send
back important information.

30:24.957 --> 30:27.791
But perhaps more interesting
than the information

30:27.893 --> 30:30.260
Voyager 1 was programmed
to collect

30:30.362 --> 30:33.564
was the information
it was carrying with it.

30:33.666 --> 30:36.900
JON LOMBERG: The two Voyager
spacecraft were each launched

30:37.002 --> 30:40.070
in 1977 on a mission
of exploration

30:40.172 --> 30:42.105
of the outer solar system.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.107
And both of them kept on going,

30:44.210 --> 30:46.844
to leave the solar system,
uh, forever.

30:46.946 --> 30:48.512
They weren't coming back.

30:48.614 --> 30:51.381
And as a result of this,
NASA invited Carl

30:51.483 --> 30:55.118
to put a message on both
of the Voyager spacecraft.

30:55.221 --> 30:57.988
NARRATOR: As conceived
by a team of experts

30:58.090 --> 31:00.390
led by famed astronomer
Carl Sagan,

31:00.492 --> 31:03.060
Voyager's so-called
Golden Record

31:03.162 --> 31:06.530
was designed to send greetings
from the people of planet Earth

31:06.632 --> 31:09.867
to whatever form of alien life
it might encounter

31:09.969 --> 31:13.237
that had intelligence enough
to decode it.

31:13.339 --> 31:16.173
I'd been collaborating with Carl
for about five years.

31:16.275 --> 31:19.509
We shared a passion
for this topic--

31:19.612 --> 31:22.913
extraterrestrial intelligence
and how to communicate with it--

31:23.015 --> 31:26.183
and I happened to be at the
right place at the right time

31:26.285 --> 31:28.318
when he was trying to form
a small team

31:28.420 --> 31:29.786
to actually make the message.

31:29.889 --> 31:32.789
I was a design director
on the project,

31:32.892 --> 31:35.259
and my main role was designing,

31:35.361 --> 31:38.962
with Frank Drake,
the series of photographs

31:39.064 --> 31:42.833
and diagrams that show what the
Earth and human beings are like.

31:42.935 --> 31:44.835
RICHARDS:
The Golden Record kick-started

31:44.937 --> 31:48.005
this thought process,
this approach to philosophy of,

31:48.107 --> 31:49.873
how do we define who we are

31:49.975 --> 31:52.542
if we came across
an intelligent civilization?

31:52.645 --> 31:55.078
How would we represent
ourselves?

31:55.180 --> 31:58.081
LOMBERG: The Golden Record
shows Earth on a good day.

31:58.183 --> 32:00.150
Some of our best music,

32:00.252 --> 32:03.220
a lot of pleasant-looking people
saying hello.

32:03.322 --> 32:06.823
No war, no poverty,
no injustice.

32:06.926 --> 32:09.092
And this was by design.

32:09.194 --> 32:12.963
First of all, it's not obvious
how you would show these things

32:13.065 --> 32:14.898
to an extraterrestrial.

32:15.000 --> 32:19.503
I mean, a starving baby evokes a
huge emotional reaction from us.

32:19.605 --> 32:22.973
Maybe a baby is supposed to look
that way. They wouldn't know.

32:23.075 --> 32:25.175
It seemed important to me,

32:25.277 --> 32:27.878
in being asked
to design this thing,

32:27.980 --> 32:30.180
that it should tell a story.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.783
And the story is,
of course,<i> our</i> story.

32:32.885 --> 32:37.454
It's a story of our planet,
it's a story of life,

32:37.556 --> 32:42.392
it's a story of humans,
and it's a story of our future.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.328
RICHARDS:
In terms of the protocols

32:44.430 --> 32:46.797
that we would use
in actually replying back

32:46.899 --> 32:49.800
to a message that we got from
an intelligent civilization,

32:49.902 --> 32:51.969
different experts
have different opinions.

32:52.071 --> 32:53.804
Some people believe
that we should try

32:53.906 --> 32:55.939
and represent the best version
of ourselves.

32:56.041 --> 32:57.574
On the other end
of the spectrum,

32:57.676 --> 33:00.310
you could potentially upload
the entire Internet,

33:00.412 --> 33:02.012
along with all
of our dark sides,

33:02.114 --> 33:04.348
so that you could have a full
and complete picture

33:04.450 --> 33:06.450
of who we are as a species.

33:08.354 --> 33:11.455
NARRATOR: Does NASA's
involvement in the design

33:11.557 --> 33:14.791
and implementation
of Carl Sagan's Golden Record

33:14.893 --> 33:17.461
provide evidence
of the government's belief

33:17.563 --> 33:21.131
that intelligent life exists
in the universe?

33:21.233 --> 33:24.267
If so,
is that belief the product

33:24.370 --> 33:27.938
of mere scientific speculation,
or a conviction

33:28.040 --> 33:32.209
based on previous
extraterrestrial encounters?

33:32.311 --> 33:36.179
For the answer, ancient
astronaut theorists point

33:36.281 --> 33:38.515
to the government's long history

33:38.617 --> 33:42.853
of trying to establish
secret alien communications.

33:42.955 --> 33:44.388
(high-pitched tones)

33:49.128 --> 33:52.396
March 24, 1961.

33:52.431 --> 33:56.299
The Brookings Report, the first
official government document

33:56.335 --> 33:58.802
to suggest protocols
for what to do

33:58.837 --> 34:02.439
in the event of alien contact,
is submitted

34:02.474 --> 34:04.975
to the House Committee
on Science and Astronautics

34:05.010 --> 34:08.745
and entered
into the Congressional Record.

34:08.781 --> 34:10.981
But ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

34:11.016 --> 34:15.419
that those protocols
weren't new,

34:15.454 --> 34:17.921
but, in fact, had been in place

34:17.956 --> 34:21.591
ever since President Harry
Truman ordered an investigation

34:21.627 --> 34:25.362
into the famed Roswell incident
in 1947.

34:27.166 --> 34:30.367
Truman,
inside of his administration,

34:30.402 --> 34:32.669
reached out to scientists,

34:32.704 --> 34:36.039
reached out to military people,
reached out to businessmen,

34:36.075 --> 34:39.943
formed this group called
Majestic 12-- MJ-12--

34:39.978 --> 34:43.213
to do research
and report to him.

34:43.248 --> 34:46.216
And no one outside
is to know anything

34:46.251 --> 34:50.387
about UFOs, E.T.s,
crash retrievals,

34:50.422 --> 34:53.223
bodies, any of it.

34:53.258 --> 34:56.293
There is actually
a document called

34:56.328 --> 34:59.129
<i> The Majestic 12</i>
<i> Special Operations Manual,</i>

34:59.164 --> 35:02.165
which actually describes

35:02.201 --> 35:06.303
what a military officer
or enlisted man should do

35:06.338 --> 35:10.807
should he encounter
a crashed UFO,

35:10.843 --> 35:13.143
should he encounter
an extraterrestrial being,

35:13.178 --> 35:16.079
alive or dead, and how the body
should be disposed of.

35:16.115 --> 35:20.350
And it's a very,
very detailed set of protocols,

35:20.385 --> 35:23.653
basically for how to handle it
if you run into E.T.

35:23.689 --> 35:27.891
NARRATOR: Aerospace engineer
Dr. Robert Wood

35:27.926 --> 35:31.428
was one of the first people
to examine the MJ-12 documents.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.763
It is his opinion, based in part

35:33.799 --> 35:36.766
on the descriptions
of spacecraft in the documents,

35:36.802 --> 35:42.038
that the<i> Special Operations</i>
<i> Manual</i> is genuine.

35:42.074 --> 35:46.042
The<i> Special Operations Manual</i> is
remarkable in several ways.

35:46.078 --> 35:50.280
It gives detailed descriptions
of four shapes of UFOs.

35:50.315 --> 35:52.449
Another thing is that it talks

35:52.484 --> 35:55.218
about extraterrestrial
biological entities.

35:55.254 --> 35:58.421
The Majestic 12
talks very frankly

35:58.457 --> 36:01.791
about extraterrestrial
biological entities,

36:01.827 --> 36:03.927
and their protocols.

36:03.962 --> 36:07.364
There is under Chapter Five,
"Encounters..."

36:18.076 --> 36:21.578
And that is tied

36:21.613 --> 36:24.948
to what happened to
Lonnie Zamora down in Socorro.

36:24.983 --> 36:31.087
BARA: On April 24, 1964, there
was a New Mexico police officer

36:31.123 --> 36:34.558
in Socorro, New Mexico
named Lonnie Zamora who noticed

36:34.593 --> 36:37.127
what appeared to him to be
some sort of wrecked vehicle

36:37.162 --> 36:38.562
off the side of the road.

36:38.597 --> 36:40.764
So he pulled his police car over

36:40.799 --> 36:42.666
and he started
to walk towards it.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.935
When he got closer
to the vehicle,

36:44.970 --> 36:47.571
he realized that it was
some sort of egg-shaped craft

36:47.606 --> 36:50.774
with these four landing legs

36:50.809 --> 36:53.009
that were stuck into the ground,
and he saw two beings

36:53.045 --> 36:56.479
who were in silver suits.

36:56.515 --> 36:58.481
And the two beings went back
inside the craft,

36:58.517 --> 37:00.750
and the object took off
and sped away.

37:00.786 --> 37:05.088
And when another officer
came back out to the site,

37:05.123 --> 37:09.025
they went to where the craft
had landed, and they discovered

37:09.061 --> 37:10.994
four holes in the ground

37:11.029 --> 37:14.130
where the landing legs had stuck
into the dirt.

37:14.166 --> 37:18.134
NARRATOR: Lonnie Zamora's
encounter made headlines

37:18.170 --> 37:21.171
in 1964.

37:21.206 --> 37:23.540
Since then, further information

37:23.575 --> 37:26.142
about the incident
has become available online

37:26.178 --> 37:28.144
from leaked government files.

37:28.180 --> 37:31.781
Files, which, if genuine,
corroborate the protocols

37:31.817 --> 37:34.951
that are described
in the MJ-12 documents.

37:38.357 --> 37:40.123
BARA: In the Serpo documents,
they talk

37:40.158 --> 37:42.993
about the Ebens, as they were
named, and arrangements

37:43.028 --> 37:46.963
for them to actually land
and have a diplomatic exchange

37:46.999 --> 37:48.698
with U.S. government officials

37:48.734 --> 37:51.201
at White Sands Missile Range
in New Mexico.

37:51.236 --> 37:53.136
What's explained
in the documents

37:53.171 --> 37:56.339
is that the Zamora sighting
is actually

37:56.375 --> 38:00.043
the two emissaries who had got
the coordinates wrong

38:00.078 --> 38:02.245
and had actually landed
in the wrong place.

38:02.281 --> 38:04.147
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

38:04.182 --> 38:07.117
that the United States
government is not only aware of,

38:07.152 --> 38:11.721
but possibly in contact with,
extraterrestrial beings?

38:13.358 --> 38:17.227
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes and suggest

38:17.262 --> 38:19.663
that the United Nations may even
have an ambassador

38:19.698 --> 38:22.265
to extraterrestrials.

38:26.138 --> 38:28.738
NARRATOR:
September 2010.

38:28.774 --> 38:32.909
News organizations
across the globe report

38:32.944 --> 38:37.080
that the United Nations Office
of Outer Space Affairs intends

38:37.115 --> 38:40.850
to draft a series of protocols
on what to do when first contact

38:40.886 --> 38:46.056
with an extraterrestrial
civilization is officially made.

38:46.091 --> 38:48.692
The story causes a sensation,

38:48.727 --> 38:51.428
but then, after a few days,

38:51.463 --> 38:54.798
the story mysteriously
disappears.

38:54.833 --> 38:58.001
When pressed
for further information,

38:58.036 --> 39:03.406
officials at the United Nations
have refused to comment.

39:03.442 --> 39:06.076
CHILDRESS:
The United Nations announced

39:06.111 --> 39:08.244
that it would create
some protocols

39:08.280 --> 39:10.714
for extraterrestrial contact,

39:10.749 --> 39:13.616
but so far
they have not given those to us.

39:13.652 --> 39:16.953
Just because protocols
have not been announced

39:16.988 --> 39:19.155
doesn't mean
that they don't exist.

39:19.191 --> 39:22.325
I believe that these protocols
are already established,

39:22.361 --> 39:26.830
and, in fact, we are already in
contact with extraterrestrials.

39:26.865 --> 39:29.566
POPE:
The United Nations have said,

39:29.601 --> 39:33.103
"Do not come to us
with questions like this

39:33.138 --> 39:36.239
until there's
an international consensus."

39:36.274 --> 39:39.509
Well, there is no international
consensus on this.

39:39.544 --> 39:42.112
TAYLOR: Imagine if aliens
showed up here tomorrow

39:42.147 --> 39:44.147
and said,
"Take me to your leader,"

39:44.182 --> 39:46.249
like you always see in the
movies or hear in the stories.

39:46.284 --> 39:48.985
Well, who would that be?
A lot of people think,

39:49.020 --> 39:50.987
"Oh, it's the Secretary General
of the U.N."

39:51.022 --> 39:54.257
Uh, well, maybe, maybe not.

39:54.292 --> 39:56.025
What they would look at is

39:56.061 --> 39:59.496
who has the largest industrial
machine on the planet.

39:59.531 --> 40:02.265
And I would say
it would have to be

40:02.300 --> 40:04.801
the president
of the United States,

40:04.836 --> 40:06.803
the president of Russia
and of China.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.438
They'd have
to be there together.

40:08.473 --> 40:11.708
NARRATOR:
But if intelligent beings

40:11.743 --> 40:14.511
are technologically advanced
enough to travel to Earth,

40:14.546 --> 40:20.183
whose protocols will
matter more-- ours or theirs?

40:20.218 --> 40:23.620
CHILDRESS: As we prepare
for this worldwide reality

40:23.655 --> 40:27.824
of extraterrestrial life being
known here on planet Earth,

40:27.859 --> 40:30.160
we have to see
that the extraterrestrials

40:30.195 --> 40:33.363
are gonna have different
protocols than we would have

40:33.398 --> 40:35.298
that will be
far more sophisticated

40:35.333 --> 40:38.001
than anything we can conceive.

40:38.036 --> 40:40.937
And we will have
to really follow their lead

40:40.972 --> 40:46.176
in how we interact with them
and other extraterrestrials

40:46.211 --> 40:48.812
as we go into space ourselves.

40:48.847 --> 40:52.048
TSOUKALOS: Are these two worlds
that are about to meet--

40:52.083 --> 40:53.850
are they compatible?

40:53.885 --> 40:58.688
And I say yes
because we come from out there.

40:58.723 --> 41:02.725
Because in Native American
culture, there are legends

41:02.761 --> 41:07.330
of 13 inhabited worlds,
planets out there,

41:07.365 --> 41:09.365
and we are the youngest.

41:09.401 --> 41:12.702
This world is called
"the planet of the children."

41:12.737 --> 41:15.205
And what does a child do?

41:15.240 --> 41:18.441
I think children-- they listen,
they soak up the knowledge.

41:18.477 --> 41:22.679
So I think it's time for us to
look more at our ancient past,

41:22.714 --> 41:24.347
look at the traditions,

41:24.382 --> 41:28.418
and see and learn
that we've never been alone.

41:28.453 --> 41:31.688
NARRATOR:
As NASA eagerly prepares

41:31.723 --> 41:33.690
to send astronauts to Mars,

41:33.725 --> 41:37.093
it must face the fact
that it will be humans

41:37.128 --> 41:40.864
that will become the alien
visitors to another planet.

41:40.899 --> 41:46.536
And what will we do if we come
face-to-face with living proof

41:46.571 --> 41:49.372
that we are not alone?

41:49.407 --> 41:55.078
Will we welcome them,
or will they welcome us?

41:55.113 --> 41:57.113
