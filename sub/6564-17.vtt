00:11.590 --> 00:14.550
Hey, did you hear why Jenn and Eileen weren't on the show today?

00:15.010 --> 00:16.840
They booked a commercial for Terry's Tacos.

00:17.440 --> 00:21.930
Ew, that place with the grody food and the irritating commercials?

00:22.520 --> 00:23.600
Why didn't we get that part?

00:24.890 --> 00:27.010
Probably because we weren't asked to audition.

00:27.510 --> 00:28.990
But by that crazy look in your eye,

00:29.180 --> 00:30.300
I'm guessing you have another opinion.

00:30.540 --> 00:32.530
-They stole our part!  - And there it is.

00:32.570 --> 00:35.280
We dance just as well as they do,

00:35.590 --> 00:37.480
and nobody loves tacos more than us.

00:37.950 --> 00:40.080
- Actually, I hate tacos.  - Quiet. You love them.

00:41.170 --> 00:42.390
You know what we need to do?

00:42.540 --> 00:44.030
Forget this nonsense?

00:44.280 --> 00:45.090
Absolutely!

00:45.440 --> 00:48.540
We should kick it up a notch and take our careers to the next level

00:49.040 --> 00:52.260
This has been another great episode of CeCe Goes Bonkers,

00:52.370 --> 00:54.510
tune in next week when she accuses random pedestrians

00:54.640 --> 00:55.970
of "stealing her look!"

00:56.550 --> 00:58.170
That girl had the same exact bangs as me!

00:58.300 --> 00:59.680
I mean, coincidence?I don't think so.

01:04.160 --> 01:07.590
Everybody, everybody,get out on the floor

01:07.820 --> 01:11.220
It can get a little crazy when the kick hits the floor

01:11.430 --> 01:14.970
Make a scene, make a scene,nobody can ignore

01:15.230 --> 01:18.860
Don't knock it  We can't take it no more

01:19.290 --> 01:22.780
Bring the lights up,bust the doors down

01:22.950 --> 01:26.250
Dust yourself off.  Shake it up, shake it up

01:26.450 --> 01:30.360
DJ set it off,take it up a notch

01:30.620 --> 01:33.620
All together now,shake it up, shake it up

01:33.960 --> 01:38.460
Sh-sh-sh-shake it up  You got to change it up

01:38.640 --> 01:42.130
And when you've had enough  Sh-sh-sh-shake it up

01:42.320 --> 01:45.190
Bring the lights up,bust the doors down

01:45.430 --> 01:48.610
All together now,shake it up, shake it up

01:51.090 --> 01:53.320
Shake it up

01:53.320 --> 01:56.420
Shake It Up!  S02E17  Weird It Up!

02:01.470 --> 02:04.460
Hey, hey, hey.You left your historybook at my place.

02:04.630 --> 02:05.500
Oh, thanks.

02:05.690 --> 02:07.990
I feel like to do something.

02:09.210 --> 02:11.100
Your history homework?

02:14.140 --> 02:15.210
Oh, yeah...

02:15.690 --> 02:16.400
But, no.

02:17.710 --> 02:20.240
Anyway, remember how you were talking about

02:20.360 --> 02:24.230
how our careers have plateaued?

02:24.900 --> 02:26.690
Actually, that was you.

02:27.670 --> 02:30.600
Well, I thought about it and you have a point.

02:30.860 --> 02:32.150
We need an agent!

02:32.480 --> 02:33.850
We don't need an agent.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.570
No, we don't.  We need a shark!

02:38.690 --> 02:40.350
Which is why I booked us an appointment

02:40.500 --> 02:44.170
with Ira Frumkin, Agent to the Stars!

02:44.570 --> 02:47.590
And I have an appointment with reality. Bye-bye!

02:49.540 --> 02:51.660
Glad we're on the same page!

02:54.790 --> 02:55.910
Coming!

03:01.180 --> 03:02.620
Thanks for the escort, Carl.

03:06.350 --> 03:07.420
Where were you?

03:07.600 --> 03:09.990
You were supposed to pick me up from school an hour ago!

03:10.340 --> 03:12.140
Now I missed my Coyote Ranger meeting,

03:12.280 --> 03:13.900
which means I can't go on the camping trip.

03:14.100 --> 03:15.820
What do you have to say for yourself?

03:16.910 --> 03:17.730
You're welcome.

03:19.100 --> 03:20.580
¡°You're welcome"?Excuese me?

03:21.100 --> 03:23.870
What? I just saved you from a weekend in the forest

03:24.010 --> 03:25.350
getting eaten by mosquitoes.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.420
Don't you mean,"I'm sorry"?

03:27.640 --> 03:28.610
Fine.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.990
I'm sorry you're overreacting.

03:31.720 --> 03:33.170
That's not an apology!

03:33.790 --> 03:36.560
An apology is when you look into someone's eyes

03:36.720 --> 03:39.200
and sincerely say,"I'm sorry."

03:40.920 --> 03:42.350
Apology accepted, Flynn.

SPEAKING SPANISH

04:03.820 --> 04:07.080
Dude, you just asked her if she wanted to eat a car with you.

04:08.880 --> 04:09.610
A car!

04:11.080 --> 04:11.890
Who is that girl?

04:12.450 --> 04:14.040
Man, that's Gloria De Leon.

04:14.240 --> 04:16.860
She's a foreign exchange student and only speaks Spanish.

04:17.130 --> 04:19.579
Hey, do me a favor and ask her out.

04:19.980 --> 04:25.490
Umm, Ty, I think my girlfriend would have a big problem with that.

04:26.220 --> 04:27.210
I meant ask her out for me.

04:27.460 --> 04:29.080
Right. Yes. Of course. I knew that.

04:33.120 --> 04:47.480
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

04:48.160 --> 04:49.930
Have fun.

04:50.110 --> 04:51.530
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:53.140 --> 04:54.680
I want you to goon the date with me.

04:57.270 --> 05:00.370
Umm, Ty, that's very flattering,

05:00.640 --> 05:03.770
but, again, I think Dina would have a problem with that.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.920
- As the translator!  - That makes much more sense.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.750
Rocky! CeCe!

05:18.090 --> 05:20.450
I'd know those faces anywhere.

05:20.740 --> 05:23.150
You've got star power.You've got "it"!

05:23.410 --> 05:26.700
Mr. Frumkin,we're Rocky and CeCe.

05:29.090 --> 05:30.730
Rocky! CeCe!

05:31.470 --> 05:33.540
I'd know those faces anywhere.

05:33.710 --> 05:35.980
You've got star power.You've got "it"!

05:37.580 --> 05:39.200
Thank you, Ira.

05:39.580 --> 05:41.080
See,The reason we called

05:41.220 --> 05:43.660
is because we think we havea ton of potential,

05:43.870 --> 05:47.410
but our careers have plateaued.

05:47.700 --> 05:48.820
Let me tell you what I see.

05:49.180 --> 05:53.410
Two girls with a ton of potential whose careers have plateaued.

05:55.310 --> 05:57.380
Wow, you totally get us.

05:57.530 --> 05:58.800
We could be doing so much more.

05:59.050 --> 06:00.680
Ah, you didn't let me finish!

06:00.870 --> 06:03.580
You two could be doing so much more.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.880
You're just repeating what she says.

06:07.140 --> 06:09.310
I feel like I'm just repeating what she says.

06:09.850 --> 06:11.850
Okay. Pump your breaks, Frumkin.

06:12.760 --> 06:14.960
I think we've heard enough.CeCe, let's go.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.570
Huh. So, you don't want to hear about

06:17.710 --> 06:19.720
the TV series I have lined up for you?

06:19.880 --> 06:20.780
We're listening.

06:21.230 --> 06:25.120
It's called "Let's Get Weird".

06:25.400 --> 06:27.720
And it's gonna make you huge stars.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.800
It's based on a popular Japanese game show,

06:31.050 --> 06:34.160
and your dancing and energy and good looks

06:34.290 --> 06:36.110
are exactly what they're looking for.

06:37.690 --> 06:39.920
And you thought we didn't need an agent.

06:49.140 --> 06:52.140
Thanks, Carl.Sorry you missed your yoga-lates class.

06:57.630 --> 06:58.700
Where have you been?

06:59.100 --> 07:00.400
You're late getting home from school.

07:00.550 --> 07:03.380
Because I was waiting for you to pick me up!

07:03.560 --> 07:06.030
How could you forget me again?

07:08.210 --> 07:11.010
Hey, I have a lot on my mind.

07:11.490 --> 07:12.640
Between "Shake It Up, Chicago! '

07:12.780 --> 07:15.180
and my burgeoning Japanese game show dancer career,

07:16.940 --> 07:19.390
there's a lot going on in CeCe Land.

07:19.590 --> 07:21.330
Oh, is CeCe Land still open?

07:21.450 --> 07:24.960
Because I heard it's been vacant for years.

07:26.200 --> 07:26.990
You know what,forget it.

07:27.150 --> 07:29.680
Just tell me that you picked up the gherkins and gummy worms

07:29.780 --> 07:32.200
for Crazy Cookie Day like you said you would.

07:32.350 --> 07:34.190
You're putting those in a cookie?

07:34.440 --> 07:36.000
I don't know.Sounds crazy.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.510
That's the point of Crazy Cookie Day!

07:41.570 --> 07:44.490
Well, now it's Store-bought Cookie Day.

07:45.650 --> 07:48.050
I forgot to get your ingredients.

07:48.420 --> 07:52.370
How could you...I'm so... Grr!

07:53.110 --> 07:55.690
You owe me a huge apology.

07:56.200 --> 07:56.980
Fine.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.580
I'm sorry...That I'm so busy.

08:01.250 --> 08:02.280
Not good enough.

08:02.520 --> 08:05.920
And I'm not leaving this room until I get a real apology.

08:09.310 --> 08:10.460
Grr!

08:18.070 --> 08:19.510
Would you like more iced tea?

08:19.840 --> 08:21.600
(TRANSLATING IN SPANISH)

08:22.420 --> 08:23.220
Si.

08:30.270 --> 08:32.220
Do you like the pizza?

08:32.770 --> 08:33.600
(TRANSLATING)

08:33.850 --> 08:34.890
Si.

08:39.309 --> 08:40.630
Riveting conversation.

08:42.340 --> 08:44.810
I'm starting to see why your relationships don't last.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.270
My relationships don't last

08:47.680 --> 08:50.360
because I blow off girls when they get too clingy.

08:52.260 --> 08:53.960
(TRANSLATING)

08:54.150 --> 08:55.820
Don't translate that!

08:57.530 --> 08:59.580
Just ask her if she'd like to go dancing.

08:59.760 --> 09:00.480
Fine.

09:01.860 --> 09:13.540
(TRANSLATING)

09:16.120 --> 09:17.980
What'd she say?

09:18.620 --> 09:22.160
She said she really likes me...meeting you.

09:22.600 --> 09:25.150
Meeting you.She said she likes meeting you.

09:26.700 --> 09:30.480
Sorry, I've been talking Spanish so much,my English is a little rusty.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.430
You know?I got you.

09:43.700 --> 09:47.340
Hey, this is kind of awesome, right?

09:49.860 --> 09:51.340
Hey, we're Rocky and CeCe.

09:51.630 --> 09:52.790
And you are the host of the show?

09:52.970 --> 09:54.650
Yeah, that's what they tell me,

09:54.840 --> 09:57.200
but I've been lied to before.

09:57.460 --> 09:59.320
"Oh, Hank,you're so talented.

09:59.470 --> 10:01.180
"Oh, Hank,you're so good looking.

10:01.430 --> 10:03.800
"Oh, Hank, you're going to be bigger than Tom Cruise."

10:05.240 --> 10:07.040
Well, I think you're a little taller.

10:07.230 --> 10:09.780
Not when he standson his pile of fame and money.

10:11.490 --> 10:12.600
Anyway, if you need me,

10:12.720 --> 10:14.570
I'll be the guy with the dead look in his eyes.

10:15.470 --> 10:18.620
Here's where you stand.

10:22.450 --> 10:25.380
Hello, everyone!I'm Hank O'Hara,

10:25.520 --> 10:28.930
and welcome to"Let's get weird!"

10:29.100 --> 10:31.470
The show where the weirder things get, the more

10:32.950 --> 10:33.770
fun we have!

10:33.920 --> 10:36.210
Say "Hi" to the Weirdettes!

10:37.820 --> 10:39.820
Okay, let's get started.The rules are simple.

10:39.960 --> 10:42.420
If the contestant gets a question right,we hear...

10:44.050 --> 10:45.190
...and he wins $10.

10:45.360 --> 10:48.200
But if he gets the question wrong,we hear...

10:49.070 --> 10:53.560
...and the Weirdettes must spin the "Wheel of Super Bad Punishment Time"

10:54.810 --> 10:57.810
and face whatever it lands on!

10:58.460 --> 11:01.180
Wow. I feel bad for whoever the Weirdettes are.

11:01.420 --> 11:03.550
CeCe, we're the Weirdettes.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.660
Why would you think we're the Weirdettes?

11:05.840 --> 11:08.480
Well, because we're the only ones on stage,

11:08.610 --> 11:10.880
we're standing nextto the big Wheel of Super Bad Punishment Time,

11:10.950 --> 11:13.030
and they made us sign that ten page waiver

11:13.140 --> 11:14.420
and give them our blood type.

11:15.430 --> 11:18.580
Let's meet our contestant,from Chicago, Illinois,

11:18.720 --> 11:19.860
please welcome...

11:19.990 --> 11:21.910
Flynn Jones!

11:23.630 --> 11:25.100
Hi, everybody!

11:25.920 --> 11:28.380
We'll be back with Round One after this!

11:30.720 --> 11:32.730
Flynn, what are you doing here?

11:33.000 --> 11:36.930
I believe the expression is "Getting even."

11:37.160 --> 11:41.050
Hey, look at that.Things really did just get weird.

11:50.540 --> 11:52.940
Flynn How did youget on this show?

11:53.200 --> 11:55.080
Oh, my new agent booked me.

12:00.090 --> 12:01.710
Your new agent?  When did this happen?

12:01.950 --> 12:04.450
Well, I was at home when Ira called for you

12:04.570 --> 12:07.830
and surprise, surprise,you weren't around to answer.

12:08.010 --> 12:09.850
So, we got to talking and he said

12:09.850 --> 12:12.220
I have a little something called star power.

12:12.870 --> 12:15.810
Ah. Let me guess,he also said you have "it"?

12:16.010 --> 12:17.690
You got that right.

12:18.160 --> 12:20.710
Come on, guys,back to your places.

12:20.940 --> 12:24.770
It's time for me to continue my soul-crushing descent into obscurity.

12:30.120 --> 12:30.820
Welcome back!

12:31.220 --> 12:34.280
Are we having the time of our lives or what?

12:34.590 --> 12:35.350
Woo-hoo!

12:35.440 --> 12:37.210
All right, let's continue.

12:37.340 --> 12:40.710
Question one: Flynn,what is the capital of Illinois?

12:40.880 --> 12:42.280
Easy one. Spring field.

12:43.660 --> 12:44.990
See, Rocky?  It's going to be fine.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.860
Name the first President of the United States.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.150
Hmm...That one's tricky.

12:50.380 --> 12:53.260
I should know this one since we're studying the Presidents in school

12:53.430 --> 12:56.130
and I've been spending a lot of extra time there lately,

12:56.290 --> 12:57.600
haven't I, CeCe?

12:58.290 --> 12:59.330
Oh, wait,now I remember.

12:59.490 --> 13:03.220
The first President was... Santa Claus.

13:03.650 --> 13:07.150
Sorry, no, the answer is George Washington.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.330
Aw...

13:08.550 --> 13:13.740
Weirdettes,spin that "Wheel of Super Bad Punishment Time"!

13:21.020 --> 13:23.860
Get ready for Sparkly Clean Mouth Joy!

13:25.610 --> 13:28.650
Toothpaste?  We have to brush our teeth?

13:28.850 --> 13:32.220
Yay, good spin! Nothing more important than a little oral hygiene.

13:32.460 --> 13:35.540
But, um, where are the toothbrushes?

13:35.660 --> 13:37.170
Good question! Audience?

13:37.370 --> 13:40.050
Let's Get Weird!

13:42.650 --> 13:55.580
Ew, it's wet, it's wet, it's wet.

13:55.730 --> 14:03.920
Brush! Brush! Brush!

14:07.490 --> 14:10.970
I don't want to do this.

14:12.660 --> 14:13.810
Ew!

14:22.420 --> 14:25.010
I don't know about everybody else,but I love this show.

14:25.410 --> 14:26.280
Japan rules!

14:33.100 --> 14:35.250
Ask Gloria whather favorite movie is.

14:36.200 --> 14:51.570
(PRAISING TY IN SPANISH)

14:52.940 --> 14:55.400
- Well?  - Avatar.

14:56.250 --> 14:57.470
Really?

14:57.770 --> 15:00.440
You were talking for,like, five minutes and that's all she said?

15:02.510 --> 15:05.000
Dude. Dude. Dude.Personal space.

15:06.630 --> 15:09.700
Right. I'm going to get some more pizza.

15:09.860 --> 15:12.160
I'll be right back.Yeah.

15:17.310 --> 15:21.310
I like <Avatar> too.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.570
You know,for some reason,

15:29.700 --> 15:31.770
I feel like Flynn is purposely getting these questions wrong.

15:32.820 --> 15:35.180
- What makes you say that?  - Oh, I don't know.

15:35.310 --> 15:36.450
Maybe because he's over there

15:36.600 --> 15:38.590
rubbing his hands together like a cartoon villain

15:38.740 --> 15:39.710
and saying "You're going down!"

15:43.970 --> 15:45.190
Oh, yeah.

15:46.420 --> 15:48.560
He's mad at me,because I won't apologize to him.

15:48.710 --> 15:51.700
Can I make a little suggestion as a friend?

15:52.080 --> 15:53.500
Apologize!

15:56.710 --> 15:58.650
We're back! Woo-hoo!All right!

15:58.910 --> 16:01.420
In this round,you get 20 dollers for every right answer.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.780
But get it wrong and the Weirdettes

16:03.940 --> 16:07.640
get dumped in the Garbage Pit of Stinky Doom.

16:08.740 --> 16:10.990
- Ready?  - Let's get weird, Hank!

16:11.170 --> 16:12.630
That's what I like to hear, Flynn!

16:12.790 --> 16:15.780
What was last year's highest selling video game?

16:16.040 --> 16:18.540
Oh, he definitely knows this one.

16:18.720 --> 16:19.850
All he does is play video games.

16:19.990 --> 16:22.510
I believe the answer is checkers?

16:23.970 --> 16:27.360
Sorry! The answer was <Big Game Zombie Hunters>.

16:27.640 --> 16:30.120
Aw, that was my next guess.

16:36.990 --> 16:41.420
Rocky, I'm sitting on an old pile of Shrimp Chow Fun.

16:41.580 --> 16:43.890
And it's not fun.

16:44.330 --> 16:47.300
I have a used tissue in my mouth!

16:50.450 --> 16:53.750
You know what?  Gloria's perfect for me.

16:54.260 --> 16:56.990
She's not like any girl I've ever gone out with.

16:57.160 --> 16:58.360
Or is she?

16:58.560 --> 17:00.990
You know,she's really into you.

17:01.170 --> 17:04.910
Like, long term,super-exclusive relationship into you.

17:05.030 --> 17:05.750
Clingy, huh?

17:06.520 --> 17:08.130
No. I feel the same way.

17:09.310 --> 17:12.190
Then I guess it would take a lot more for you to lose interest.

17:12.329 --> 17:13.270
Absolutely.

17:13.480 --> 17:14.630
Well, then here's some more.

17:14.750 --> 17:16.970
She wants you to meet her entire family,

17:17.099 --> 17:19.010
and she expects a promise ring.

17:19.250 --> 17:20.200
A promise what now?

17:21.260 --> 17:23.200
Anything you'd like me to translate for you?

17:25.400 --> 17:28.470
No, thanks.I got this one.

17:28.980 --> 17:30.270
Adios.

17:32.070 --> 17:33.080
Yes!

17:33.460 --> 17:35.130
Well, that worked pretty good.

17:37.350 --> 17:39.160
What? Uh-oh.

17:46.260 --> 17:47.140
Welcome back!

17:47.410 --> 17:49.420
It's time for the lightning round

17:49.750 --> 17:51.910
where each correct answer is worth $50,

17:52.100 --> 17:54.070
but every question you get wrong

17:54.190 --> 17:57.400
brings the "Ultra Box Smelly No Good"

17:57.530 --> 17:59.650
closer to the faces of the Weirdettes.

17:59.830 --> 18:03.690
Five wrong and they get a face full of smelly no good!

18:05.090 --> 18:07.910
Oh, godfather,it's feet!

18:08.090 --> 18:13.350
You can smell them from here.

18:14.540 --> 18:15.640
Okay.Question one:

18:15.760 --> 18:17.410
Which is bigger,the earth or the moon?

18:17.540 --> 18:18.540
-Moon.  -Wrong.

18:18.970 --> 18:20.980
How many inches in a foot?

18:21.100 --> 18:21.840
-A thousand.  -Wrong.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.380
Apologizeto Flynn already!

18:24.500 --> 18:25.910
No! I will not let him win!

18:27.120 --> 18:28.340
Flynn, she said she's sorry!

18:28.490 --> 18:29.530
No, I didn't!

18:29.740 --> 18:31.470
What is the capital of the United States?

18:31.600 --> 18:32.390
-Fifty.  -Wrong.

18:33.660 --> 18:35.910
How many states are there in the United States?

18:36.030 --> 18:37.640
- Washington D.C.  - Wrong.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.560
- Apologize!  - Never!

18:40.750 --> 18:41.960
How many units in a baker's dozen?

18:42.060 --> 18:43.510
- Thirteen.  - That's right!

18:43.690 --> 18:45.920
- hundred.Thirteen-hundred.  - That's wrong!

18:52.490 --> 18:56.110
Hey, CeCe, you want some crackers to go with that toe cheese?

18:57.080 --> 18:58.440
Can this get any weirder?

18:58.620 --> 19:03.060
Find out after the break,on <Let's Get Weird>!

19:05.670 --> 19:09.270
Oh, I have a piece of toast under my hair.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.920
CeCe, we've used sweaty toothbrushes,

19:14.050 --> 19:15.290
we've been dunked in garbage,

19:15.400 --> 19:16.870
and we just got toe jam jammed in our faces.

19:17.050 --> 19:17.890
Now, I don't know what you did,

19:18.030 --> 19:19.600
but you better go apologize right now

19:19.770 --> 19:23.000
or you'll have to deal with my Wheel of Super Bad Punishment Time.

19:23.990 --> 19:24.960
Fine!

19:27.710 --> 19:30.760
Flynn, I'm sorry I didn't pick you up from school...

19:32.760 --> 19:33.500
twice.

19:34.430 --> 19:37.390
I'm sorry I made you miss your scout meeting,

19:37.560 --> 19:39.700
and I'm sorry for forgetting about Crazy Cookie Day.

19:40.700 --> 19:42.290
Great, you apologized for everything

19:42.790 --> 19:45.260
except for the thing that I'm really mad about.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.060
What?

19:47.380 --> 19:49.930
That you don't really care about me.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.280
Come on, Flynn,don't say that.

19:54.430 --> 19:56.040
You're my brother,of course I care about you.

19:56.430 --> 19:59.590
Much like the"Diaper of Doom" over there,your apology stinks.

19:59.980 --> 20:02.220
You weren't there when I needed you.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.020
come on, Flynn.

20:06.110 --> 20:08.040
When have you ever needed anyone?

20:08.570 --> 20:11.460
When you were three you installed Wi-Fi in the apartment.

20:11.920 --> 20:12.860
And when you were six

20:13.150 --> 20:15.570
you helped Mom get a refund on her taxes.

20:17.230 --> 20:19.760
You're more capable than anyone I know.

20:20.570 --> 20:25.280
I guess sometimes I forget that you're still a kid

20:25.440 --> 20:27.940
and that you need your big sister.

20:28.130 --> 20:31.040
And for that I'm so sorry.

20:31.640 --> 20:34.890
Well, in that case...No biggie! We're cool.

20:35.830 --> 20:38.460
All right, then let's get out of here! Okay.

20:39.380 --> 20:41.240
And, we're back!

20:41.430 --> 20:45.190
And now,one question is worth $1,000.

20:45.330 --> 20:49.090
Flynn, in Alexandre Dumas'classic tale about musketeers,

20:49.250 --> 20:51.450
how many musketeers were there?

20:51.610 --> 20:53.620
No, no, no, no.No more questions!

20:53.810 --> 20:55.220
Okay. Everything's fine now.They made up!

20:55.400 --> 20:57.950
I don't know what you're talking about,and I don't care!

20:59.030 --> 21:01.090
Don't worry, Rocky.I got this one.

21:01.370 --> 21:03.060
There were three musketeers, Hank.

21:03.250 --> 21:04.390
Wrong!

21:04.950 --> 21:06.950
There were four musketeers!  Four Musketeers!

21:07.190 --> 21:08.850
That's right! But your answers don't count!

21:09.140 --> 21:12.010
Time for "Baby Birds Make Chow-Chow"!

21:12.310 --> 21:14.140
Oh, I love baby birds!

21:14.320 --> 21:15.170
They're just so cute!

21:15.360 --> 21:17.320
Those aren't baby birds.

21:17.740 --> 21:21.100
CeCe, I think we're the baby birds.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.200
Open wide,it's lunch time!

21:25.450 --> 21:26.380
no!

21:38.300 --> 21:40.550
Okay, the game show turned out to be

21:40.670 --> 21:43.660
a little different than we expected

21:43.790 --> 21:45.180
But  let me make it up to you

21:45.330 --> 21:49.100
How? Is there a new game show

21:49.260 --> 21:53.570
Or maybe you gotta see geek dancing on a nuclear reactor

21:54.150 --> 21:56.610
Come on , girls . One more chance

21:56.700 --> 22:01.170
Save it, Frumkin. We're not interested in being represented by you any more

22:01.300 --> 22:05.760
fine ,but you still own me 10% of your earning from the game show

22:05.940 --> 22:06.920
Are you sure?

22:07.040 --> 22:07.860
Absolutely

22:09.470 --> 22:11.330
Ok then ,you got it .

22:21.110 --> 22:23.670
You know what ,You've got star power.

22:25.880 --> 22:27.930
You got it.
