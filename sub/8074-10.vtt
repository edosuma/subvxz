[music playing]

00:03.671 --> 00:05.939
[harmonica music]

00:07.475 --> 00:10.944
See, I told you that
amnio wouldn't be that bad.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.080
Yeah.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.381
They stick a needle
in my stomach,

00:13.414 --> 00:15.316
and they suck out
a bunch of goo.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.717
I wanna come back
tomorrow and see if they

00:16.750 --> 00:17.618
can do that for my butt.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.387
[laughter]

00:21.289 --> 00:24.458
Well, what do you think it's
gonna be, a boy or a girl?

00:24.492 --> 00:26.960
Well, boy or girl
really isn't the question,

00:26.994 --> 00:28.562
so much as good or evil.

00:28.596 --> 00:29.930
[laughter]

00:31.199 --> 00:32.566
Now come on, they're
having a big Thanksgiving

00:32.600 --> 00:33.901
sale down at Buy
n' Bag, and I gotta

00:33.934 --> 00:35.035
get a turkey for next week.

00:35.069 --> 00:37.171
All right, but get an
organic one this year,

00:37.205 --> 00:38.339
because those
regular ones, they're

00:38.372 --> 00:40.374
pumped up with chemicals
and growth hormones.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.843
Yeah, but DJ's favorite
part's the third leg.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.078
[laughter]

00:45.479 --> 00:48.616
Excuse me, you might want
to use the backdoor to avoid

00:48.649 --> 00:50.151
those abortion protesters.

00:50.184 --> 00:51.352
Oh, they won't hassle us.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.321
We'll just tell them we're
with the prenatal care.

00:53.354 --> 00:54.222
It doesn't matter.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.456
They won't believe you.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.958
Well, what right do they
have to hassle anybody?

00:57.991 --> 01:01.129
Well, these things
can get violent.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.896
Roseanne, let's go out the back.

01:02.930 --> 01:03.797
No way.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.433
I'm kicking ass for two, now.

01:05.466 --> 01:06.467
[laughter]

01:07.468 --> 01:09.337
[chatter]

01:10.538 --> 01:11.405
Hey, ho!

01:11.439 --> 01:12.340
Hey, ho!

01:12.373 --> 01:14.342
Life begins when we say so!

01:14.375 --> 01:15.943
[laughter]

01:17.445 --> 01:18.579
Are you with us?

01:18.612 --> 01:19.480
Oh, yeah.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.649
I'm from the central office.

01:21.682 --> 01:24.652
My name is Enid, and
this is, uh, Jackie.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.387
[laughter]

01:27.855 --> 01:29.056
No, no, now, Enid.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.858
No, you can tell
them my real name.

01:30.891 --> 01:31.759
I'm Roseanne.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.361
[laughter]

01:34.795 --> 01:37.731
Well, I can see why you're
so committed to this cause.

01:37.765 --> 01:38.799
You look like a fetus.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.401
[laughter]

01:43.204 --> 01:44.305
I think I remember you.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.240
Weren't you at that
action in Wichita?

01:46.274 --> 01:48.942
Well, I wanted to be there,
but I got stuck setting

01:48.976 --> 01:50.511
myself on fire up in Omaha.

01:50.544 --> 01:51.979
[laughter]

01:53.347 --> 01:55.283
So what'd you find
out about this place?

01:55.316 --> 01:59.119
Well, we did a total sweep,
and the place is clean.

01:59.153 --> 02:01.322
Hey, you just stuck
your kid in the eye

02:01.355 --> 02:03.224
with your Save
the Children sign.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.525
[laughter]

02:04.558 --> 02:07.495
But we were told they were
performing abortions here.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.830
Well, see, we've been getting
a lot of really bad information

02:09.863 --> 02:10.964
lately.
I don't know.

02:10.998 --> 02:12.266
I think we got a mole.

02:12.300 --> 02:16.170
I don't wanna point any fingers,
but Roseanne there is new.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.938
[laughter]

02:18.939 --> 02:19.873
So what do we do?

02:19.907 --> 02:20.774
Oh, don't worry.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.576
I got everything under control.

02:22.610 --> 02:26.847
Um, I'm giving you the
address of a clinic

02:26.880 --> 02:28.516
that is very active today.

02:31.852 --> 02:32.986
All right.
Let's go.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.188
Let's go.

02:34.222 --> 02:36.324
And afterwards, we got a
big pro-capital punishment

02:36.357 --> 02:37.291
rally we can go to.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.659
[laughter]

02:38.692 --> 02:39.993
Thanks, Enid.

02:40.027 --> 02:44.465
All right, everybody, follow me!

02:44.498 --> 02:46.467
[laughter]

02:46.500 --> 02:48.636
Roseanne, you may
not agree with him,

02:48.669 --> 02:50.904
but how can you send him
on a wild goose chase?

02:50.938 --> 02:51.805
I didn't.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.274
I sent him to mom's.

02:53.307 --> 02:55.243
[laughter]

02:55.276 --> 02:57.645
[theme music]

03:40.421 --> 03:42.856
[laughing]

03:42.890 --> 03:45.259
[music playing]

03:51.832 --> 03:53.200
Staircase pattern on two, hut!

03:53.233 --> 03:54.402
Hut!

03:54.435 --> 03:55.803
They're trying to double
team Conner on this one.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.070
He blows past the first guy.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.672
Fakes toward the staircase!

03:58.706 --> 04:00.274
The crowd goes crazy!

04:00.308 --> 04:02.075
[cheering]

04:04.044 --> 04:05.879
Study these moves,
boys, for you shall

04:05.913 --> 04:08.115
be performing same tomorrow.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.317
What are you talking about?

04:09.350 --> 04:11.752
It's the annual Thanksgiving
Day football game.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.186
We need a couple
of fearless he-men

04:13.220 --> 04:14.955
to replace the guys whose
wives won't let them play.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.390
[laughter]

04:16.424 --> 04:17.525
Cool, we'll be there.

04:17.558 --> 04:18.426
Yeah, cool.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.060
FRED: All right, let's go, Dan.

04:20.093 --> 04:23.797
Mark, when I look
at you, I see speed.

04:23.831 --> 04:26.400
David, when I look at
you, I know we won't leave

04:26.434 --> 04:27.368
any equipment on the field.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.169
[laughter]

04:30.203 --> 04:31.171
That's great.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.940
I haven't played
football in a long time.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.308
Yeah, me neither.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.243
I just hope I don't get stuck
being the guy with his hands

04:36.276 --> 04:37.778
on some other guy's butt.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.880
Well, what position
do you want to play?

04:39.913 --> 04:41.415
Well, I don't know,
like the guy who

04:41.449 --> 04:43.116
does the main scoring thing.

04:43.150 --> 04:45.986
You know, like the
lineback flanking guy.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.588
[laughter]

04:48.589 --> 04:50.358
What?

04:50.391 --> 04:51.459
Leave me alone.

04:51.492 --> 04:52.292
Wait a minute.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.897
You don't know anything
about football, do you?

04:56.930 --> 04:58.065
So what?

04:58.098 --> 04:59.333
When I was in high school,
I had better things

04:59.367 --> 05:00.934
to do than chase a
stupid ball around.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.202
Like what?

05:02.235 --> 05:04.304
Like beating up artsy
fem boys like you.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.039
[laughter]

05:06.073 --> 05:08.876
At least I know
how to play football.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.579
You know, I always had this
theory about football players.

05:11.612 --> 05:14.114
Touching each other on the
butt, sticking their butts up

05:14.147 --> 05:15.616
in the air, and
wearing really tight

05:15.649 --> 05:18.018
pants to show off their butts.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.953
What are you saying, Mark?

05:19.987 --> 05:21.088
That they're
really into butts.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.056
[laughter]

05:23.090 --> 05:25.559
And I don't want anyone
checking me out back there.

05:25.593 --> 05:26.594
Why not?

05:26.627 --> 05:27.495
Cut it out.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.596
[laughter]

05:29.329 --> 05:30.230
All right, Mark.

05:30.263 --> 05:31.632
I was gonna offer
to help you out.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.300
But, uh, if you don't mind being
embarrassed tomorrow in front

05:33.333 --> 05:34.167
of your father-in-law, hey.

05:37.605 --> 05:38.706
All right.

05:38.739 --> 05:39.807
Look, I'm sorry, man.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.109
Would you mind teaching me?
- Of course not.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.144
You're my brother.

05:44.177 --> 05:48.115
Now, both teams get
several chances to score.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.082
These are called downs.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.418
Now on first down,

05:50.451 --> 05:52.352
Well, wait, how
many are there?

05:52.386 --> 05:53.554
I can't believe
you haven't picked

05:53.587 --> 05:55.456
up any of the last 20 years.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.324
And I can't believe you
haven't picked up any sailors

05:57.357 --> 05:58.426
in the past 20 minutes.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.127
[laughter]

06:01.562 --> 06:03.731
OK, fine.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.933
To answer your question,
there's seven downs.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.668
[laughter]

06:09.036 --> 06:11.204
Well, I thought there was
always, uh, four or five.

06:11.238 --> 06:13.006
Oh, Mark, no.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.175
Now if you catch the
ball on the fourth down,

06:15.208 --> 06:16.276
you cannot run with it.

06:16.309 --> 06:17.478
You have to stop
right where you are

06:17.511 --> 06:18.979
and throw the ball
down on the ground.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.180
[laughter]

06:20.213 --> 06:21.815
Now, that's called a spike.
- Yeah, hey, spike.

06:21.849 --> 06:22.950
I've seen that.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.317
That's when you do the
dance thing, too, right?

06:24.351 --> 06:25.385
- Yes.
- Yeah.

06:25.419 --> 06:26.787
Yes, you gotta do the dance.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.422
Because once you spike the ball
down the middle of the field,

06:28.456 --> 06:30.157
believe me, everybody's
gonna be looking at you.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.625
[laughter]

06:31.659 --> 06:34.061
[music playing]

06:40.100 --> 06:41.969
Well, is it a boy?

06:42.002 --> 06:43.270
No, it's a girl.

06:43.303 --> 06:44.772
And her name is
Darlene, and she's not

06:44.805 --> 06:45.739
coming home for Thanksgiving.

06:45.773 --> 06:46.907
[laughter]

06:48.108 --> 06:49.843
Great, more hummus
and tabbouleh for me.

06:49.877 --> 06:50.811
[laughter]

06:50.844 --> 06:53.481
Did you call the clinic?

06:53.514 --> 06:56.784
No, I was thinking maybe we're
not supposed to know the sex.

06:56.817 --> 07:00.053
Maybe we should do what we did
with DJ, wait till he's 10,

07:00.087 --> 07:01.121
and then let him decide.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.556
[laughter]

07:02.590 --> 07:05.358
Oh, I wanna know.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.260
I wanna tell
everybody at dinner.

07:07.294 --> 07:08.862
Maybe your mom will get
so excited she'll choke.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.030
[laughter]

07:10.063 --> 07:10.931
Oh, OK.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.399
Let's find out.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.602
At least this way it'll keep
you from trying to peek at it

07:14.635 --> 07:15.503
while I'm asleep.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.337
[laughter]

07:18.839 --> 07:21.174
[singing] Over the river
and through the woods, from

07:21.208 --> 07:23.076
grandmother's house I come.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.377
[laughter]

07:24.411 --> 07:27.548
Look what just crawled out
from under Plymouth Rock.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.416
[laughter]

07:30.551 --> 07:34.154
Your Nana Mary just
came in, and she's

07:34.187 --> 07:36.223
brought a special guest.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.526
It's her new husband.

07:38.559 --> 07:41.328
This may turn out to be
the worst holiday ever.

07:41.361 --> 07:43.196
[laughter]

07:43.230 --> 07:44.131
She got married?

07:44.164 --> 07:45.499
Yes!

07:45.533 --> 07:48.268
Your Nana Mary has finally found
the man she wishes to spend

07:48.301 --> 07:49.903
the rest of her life with.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.271
Well, that's a big step.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.941
I mean, at her age that's at
least a three year commitment.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.408
[laughter]

07:55.442 --> 07:58.178
Happy Thanksgiving, everybody!

07:58.211 --> 08:00.881
Hey, anybody wanna baste
this old bird with any booze

08:00.914 --> 08:01.915
you got around handy?

08:01.949 --> 08:03.383
[laughter]

08:03.416 --> 08:06.319
So, uh, who's the looker?

08:06.353 --> 08:07.287
[laughter]

08:07.320 --> 08:08.756
This is Joe.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.023
That's all she'd tell me.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.892
Just Joe.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.326
Hey, Joe, what do you know?

08:13.360 --> 08:14.361
[laughter]

08:14.394 --> 08:17.631
Now he doesn't hear
very well, Rosie.

08:17.665 --> 08:20.300
But that's the price you pay
for defending your country

08:20.333 --> 08:21.434
against the Kaiser.

08:21.468 --> 08:23.336
[laughter]

08:25.438 --> 08:29.777
So, uh, does he do anything?

08:29.810 --> 08:32.045
Well, what he's gonna do
right now is take a leak.

08:32.079 --> 08:33.480
[laughter]

08:34.648 --> 08:36.950
It was a very long, long trip.
Thank you.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.920
Yes, it's another Norman
Rockwell Thanksgiving

08:39.953 --> 08:40.954
at your house, Roseanne.

08:40.988 --> 08:43.490
It's right down the hall!

08:43.523 --> 08:45.125
Zoom, look at him go.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.526
[laughter]

08:46.560 --> 08:48.896
Come sit down
with me, Nana Mary.

08:48.929 --> 08:52.165
Or should I just
call you Mrs. Joe?

08:52.199 --> 08:54.568
Hey, Roseanne, isn't there a
phone call you wanted to make

08:54.602 --> 08:55.535
before it gets too late?

08:55.569 --> 08:56.536
Oh, yeah.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.105
You know the holidays
are the busiest

08:58.138 --> 08:59.807
time for us phone sex gals.

08:59.840 --> 09:00.908
[laughter]

09:01.909 --> 09:03.744
Well, Mary, you look great.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.613
Marriage must really
agree with you, kiddo.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.114
Thank you, Dan.

09:07.147 --> 09:10.918
My complexion cleared up as soon
as Joey and I started doing it.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.986
Oh, mother!

09:13.020 --> 09:14.688
Shut up, Beverly.

09:14.722 --> 09:17.490
I was hoping that it would
bring back his hearing.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.326
Instead, he went
blind in one eye.

09:19.359 --> 09:20.661
[laughter]

09:21.328 --> 09:22.195
That'll happen.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.096
Excuse me, ladies.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.865
[laughter]

09:26.399 --> 09:28.168
So, should I get the pink
or blue football helmet?

09:28.201 --> 09:29.069
Just a minute.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.672
She's checking.

09:31.705 --> 09:32.806
Yeah, hi.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.642
OK, so what kind
of kid have we got?

09:34.675 --> 09:36.509
Does it have indoor
or outdoor plumbing?

09:36.543 --> 09:37.645
[laughter]

09:37.678 --> 09:39.613
Uh, Mrs. Conner, I'm
afraid I'm not allowed

09:39.647 --> 09:41.815
to give you that information.
- Well, why not?

09:41.849 --> 09:43.416
You just were going
to a minute ago.

09:43.450 --> 09:44.718
Well, I know.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.154
It's just I'm not allowed
to give out any information

09:47.187 --> 09:50.924
in situations like this.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.694
What are you talking
about, situations like this?

09:53.727 --> 09:56.029
NURSE: You'll have to
speak to the doctor.

09:56.063 --> 09:56.964
No, you just tell me.

09:56.997 --> 09:57.898
Is something wrong?

09:57.931 --> 09:59.032
What's wrong with the baby?

09:59.066 --> 10:00.701
You'll really have
to ask the doctor.

10:00.734 --> 10:01.769
Well put him on the phone.

10:01.802 --> 10:02.670
I can't.

10:02.703 --> 10:03.804
He left for the holiday.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.405
But I'll page him,
and I'm sure he'll

10:05.438 --> 10:07.007
call you as soon as he can.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.042
Tell him he better
get back to me quick.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.310
And remind him that
I'm the one that

10:10.343 --> 10:11.812
yelled into his stethoscope.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.613
[laughter]

10:16.049 --> 10:17.450
What is it?

10:17.484 --> 10:19.419
We have to wait for
the doctor to call.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.125
It's probably nothing.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.226
Yeah, yeah, right.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.627
That's why the nurse
wouldn't say anything.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.062
Well, that nurse
probably doesn't even

10:29.096 --> 10:30.063
know what she's talking about.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.498
Yeah, but what
if she does, Dan?

10:31.531 --> 10:33.667
What then?

10:33.701 --> 10:38.005
Well, then we'll do what we
always said were were gonna do.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.974
We'll just try again.

10:41.008 --> 10:44.144
Dan, evidently
mother's new husband

10:44.177 --> 10:45.946
needs your help
getting off the toilet.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.447
[laughter]

10:49.316 --> 10:52.619
I don't know how Christmas
is going to top this.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.887
[laughter]

10:53.921 --> 10:55.856
[music playing]

10:56.857 --> 10:59.192
[music playing]

11:03.196 --> 11:04.564
I love Thanksgiving!

11:04.597 --> 11:07.735
The whole family pitching in on
the meal, and pretending mother

11:07.768 --> 11:09.837
hasn't made a horrible
mistake with her life.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.872
Mom, come on.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.673
Joe's been a big help.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.008
He snapped three beans!

11:15.042 --> 11:16.643
[laughter]

11:18.111 --> 11:22.449
Why-- why him, mother?

11:22.482 --> 11:24.718
Why is this old man my daddy?

11:24.752 --> 11:26.486
[laughter]

11:28.055 --> 11:28.922
Hey.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.724
How'd the game go?

11:30.758 --> 11:31.624
I don't know.

11:31.658 --> 11:32.926
Why don't you ask Spike?

11:32.960 --> 11:34.561
[laughter]

11:35.562 --> 11:36.964
Look, I'm really sorry, Dan.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.031
That's OK.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.933
Nothing's going right
this Thanksgiving.

11:39.967 --> 11:43.270
It wasn't so bad you threw the
ball down on the 30 yard line

11:43.303 --> 11:44.237
like that.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.473
But what did you
do that dance for?

11:46.506 --> 11:48.208
[laughter]

11:48.241 --> 11:49.943
It was fourth down, hot shot!

11:49.977 --> 11:51.812
[laughter]

11:51.845 --> 11:53.180
Sorry you lost.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.381
No, it was great.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.348
[laughter]

11:55.382 --> 11:57.317
Hey, honey.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.686
Did you get a call?

11:59.719 --> 12:01.354
You didn't talk to
anybody but this, did you?

12:01.388 --> 12:02.722
- No.
- Good.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.391
I don't want anybody making
a big deal out of this

12:04.424 --> 12:07.394
before we know anything.
Just try not to think about it.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.728
Yeah, it would
be silly to worry

12:08.762 --> 12:11.164
about that, when the Bears
are having such a bad season.

12:14.802 --> 12:15.903
Here.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.271
Oh, I don't need
a sweater, Roseanne.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.373
I brought my own
special schnapps.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.542
Want a bite?

12:22.575 --> 12:23.777
She can't Nana Mary.

12:23.811 --> 12:25.178
She's pregnant.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.579
Oh, come on.

12:26.613 --> 12:29.016
My goodness, it's not as if the
fetus had to drive somewhere.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.650
[laughter]

12:32.552 --> 12:35.022
I'll do that.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.324
Hey, so, did you
call the clinic?

12:37.357 --> 12:40.928
Uh, yeah, but I
couldn't get through.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.262
Why not?

12:42.295 --> 12:44.431
Well, you know, all
those pregnant teenagers

12:44.464 --> 12:45.365
just hog the phone.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.934
[laughter]

12:46.967 --> 12:50.637
Roseanne, I heard what
you did about those abortion

12:50.670 --> 12:51.805
protesters.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.473
I'm proud of you, baby.

12:53.506 --> 12:54.607
Oh, yes, Roseanne.

12:54.641 --> 12:56.576
You're quite the revolutionary.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.079
I'm surprised you're not
down at some coffee shop

12:59.112 --> 13:00.113
hitting bongos.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.281
[laughter]

13:02.582 --> 13:06.553
You know, I had two
abortions when I was young.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.889
Mother, you what?

13:08.922 --> 13:10.023
Yeah.

13:10.057 --> 13:11.424
You heard her.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.926
I heard her.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.228
Everybody heard her, except Joe.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.064
[laughter]

13:20.500 --> 13:21.734
Roseanne, come on.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.636
This is huge.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.705
You had two
abortions, Nana Mary?

13:25.738 --> 13:27.274
That must have been so hard.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.242
Well, it was pretty
tough in those days.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.444
The laws were very strict.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.613
I had to go to some
terrible place way

13:33.646 --> 13:35.682
on the south side of Chicago.

13:35.715 --> 13:36.917
That was the first time.

13:36.950 --> 13:40.653
So the second time
I went to Mexico.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.089
Or was that to get wool?

13:42.122 --> 13:43.891
[laughter]

13:46.759 --> 13:48.996
I think it's an abomination.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.464
If you're willing to lie
on your back and have sex

13:51.498 --> 13:53.633
you should be willing to
face the consequences.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.635
Who said I was on my back?

13:55.668 --> 13:58.038
[laughter]

13:58.071 --> 13:59.907
[cheering]

14:03.376 --> 14:06.113
Gee, I wonder who told
the abortion stories

14:06.146 --> 14:07.614
at the very first Thanksgiving.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.249
[laughter]

14:09.282 --> 14:13.954
Now what if I decided to have
an abortion with you, Roseanne,

14:13.987 --> 14:15.923
or with your sister?

14:15.956 --> 14:19.726
What would have happened then?

14:19.759 --> 14:21.594
Would you like me
to tell you, mom?

14:21.628 --> 14:24.331
Maybe you wouldn't have had to
marry some guy you didn't love,

14:24.364 --> 14:26.466
and you would have had a
happy and fulfilling life.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.668
Wouldn't that be an abomination?

14:28.701 --> 14:30.070
Yes, it would, Roseanne.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.772
Because I know the difference
between right and wrong.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.841
And abortion is wrong.

14:34.874 --> 14:39.146
Well, thank you for giving
us all the truth, mother.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.813
I've always wondered
what that red phone

14:40.847 --> 14:44.384
was doing in your apartment
with the word God on it.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.785
That's right.

14:45.818 --> 14:49.522
I went to Mexico for the wool,
and to Canada for the abortion.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.823
[laughter]

14:50.857 --> 14:52.059
I used to love to travel.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.693
[laughter]

14:55.695 --> 14:58.966
Roseanne, what is it?

14:58.999 --> 15:01.834
This, uh, nurse
down at the clinic

15:01.868 --> 15:05.005
said there might be something
wrong with the baby.

15:05.038 --> 15:05.905
Oh my god.

15:05.939 --> 15:06.806
What?

15:06.839 --> 15:09.209
I don't know.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.944
Oh, Roseanne, I am so sorry.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.513
When are you gonna find out?

15:13.546 --> 15:15.448
We're just sitting here
waiting for the doctor to call.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.784
He hasn't called you back
yet, at a time like this?

15:17.817 --> 15:20.687
How can the man
be so insensitive?

15:20.720 --> 15:22.655
Well, I'm guessing
he's never been pregnant.

15:22.689 --> 15:23.756
[laughter]

15:25.158 --> 15:27.460
You and Dan must
be scared to death.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.329
Well, actually,
Dan isn't allowing

15:29.362 --> 15:33.600
himself to feel anything
until we know for sure.

15:33.633 --> 15:38.605
Well, it is lucky that you're
so early in the pregnancy.

15:38.638 --> 15:41.574
Yeah, it's not
that early, Jackie.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.609
I heard the heart beat.

15:45.912 --> 15:48.248
You know, I always thought
that I could have an abortion.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.317
But now I just--

15:50.350 --> 15:51.484
I don't think I can.

15:51.518 --> 15:55.388
A part of me would always
wonder what the kid

15:55.422 --> 15:57.557
was gonna turn out to be.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.859
Oh, Roseanne.

15:59.892 --> 16:04.231
I can't believe that Nana
Mary went through this twice.

16:04.264 --> 16:07.234
Well, at least we're
better off than she was.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.868
At least we have a choice.

16:08.901 --> 16:11.504
Oh, yeah, we're so lucky.

16:11.538 --> 16:12.339
We get to choose.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.210
Oh, I was gonna take a shower.

16:17.244 --> 16:18.245
But I guess I can go upstairs.

16:18.278 --> 16:19.812
Um, Dan, I think
we should talk.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.417
I was thinking.

16:24.451 --> 16:28.755
And even if something
turns out to be wrong,

16:28.788 --> 16:30.657
I'm just not sure
what I want to do.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.195
Jackie, could you leave
us alone for a minute?

16:42.269 --> 16:44.237
Look, I thought we decided
that if there was, you know,

16:44.271 --> 16:47.374
a serious problem that
we would deal with it.

16:47.407 --> 16:50.110
I mean, we talked about this.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.011
Yeah, but everything's
different now.

16:52.045 --> 16:52.812
Why?

16:55.448 --> 16:56.249
Because I'm pregnant.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.621
So are you saying you want to
have this baby no matter what?

17:01.654 --> 17:02.589
No.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.657
I'm-- I'm just
saying that this is

17:04.691 --> 17:07.660
a much more complicated
decision than

17:07.694 --> 17:09.762
I ever thought it would be.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.764
Well, I refuse to
deal with this now.

17:11.798 --> 17:15.535
I mean, if this is real, you'll
probably feel differently.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.537
Don't tell me
how I'm gonna feel.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.005
I'm not telling you
how you're gonna feel.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.373
I'm just saying
when the time comes

17:20.407 --> 17:22.242
for you to make a decision,
you're not gonna make it alone.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.344
Why?
Are you gonna make it for me?

17:24.377 --> 17:25.445
No, I'm gonna
make it with you.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.614
I mean, after all,
this is half my kid.

17:27.647 --> 17:28.981
Yeah, but it's in my body.

17:29.015 --> 17:30.650
That's great, as long as
it stays in your body.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.820
When it comes out, I've gotta
take half the responsibility.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.223
Dan, telling the kids
every couple of years

17:36.256 --> 17:38.858
that they cannot
have a dog is not

17:38.891 --> 17:40.393
taking half the responsibility.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.095
[laughter]

17:45.565 --> 17:49.369
So that's all am around
here, is a sperm donor.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.738
No.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.873
You're also sort of an ornament.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.675
[laughter]

17:58.578 --> 18:00.280
This is ridiculous.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.549
We're gonna wait for the call.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.951
Yeah, and what am I supposed
to do in the meantime?

18:04.984 --> 18:07.387
Count our blessings!

18:07.420 --> 18:09.822
[music playing]

18:20.367 --> 18:22.835
Hey, there you are, Roseanne.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.003
Everything looks
great this year.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.310
Roseanne, Dan,
you wanna serve?

18:30.343 --> 18:33.246
I'll do it.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.314
I'll take this out to Joe.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.716
Oh, isn't he gonna
join us for dinner?

18:36.749 --> 18:38.718
After all, it might be
his last Thanksgiving.

18:38.751 --> 18:39.786
[laughter]

18:41.020 --> 18:43.356
Listen, he's quite all
right just where he is.

18:43.390 --> 18:45.758
He's got in his bell, in
case he starts to choke.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.059
[laughter]

18:47.093 --> 18:48.561
Sweetie!

18:48.595 --> 18:49.962
Don't eat too much.

18:49.996 --> 18:51.798
Leave room for your medications.

18:51.831 --> 18:52.999
[laughter]

18:53.032 --> 18:55.535
What's the matter, baby?
[baby crying]

18:55.568 --> 18:58.004
Perhaps he's choking and
he can't find his bell.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.472
Shut up, Bev.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.541
No, you shut up.

19:01.574 --> 19:06.813
Everybody shut up
and eat the dinner!

19:06.846 --> 19:09.282
[telephone ringing]

19:09.316 --> 19:10.217
I'll get it.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.222
Hello?

19:15.255 --> 19:18.057
Uh, yeah, doctor.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.459
Excuse me.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.361
No.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.730
So now dinner's
been interrupted.

19:23.763 --> 19:27.600
I mean, will nothing
go right this year?

19:27.634 --> 19:30.069
Oh stop bellyaching, Beverly.

19:30.102 --> 19:32.272
All you do is complain.

19:32.305 --> 19:36.943
Try to think of one thing you
can be grateful for this year.

19:36.976 --> 19:41.748
Yes, I am grateful for
such a sensitive mother who

19:41.781 --> 19:47.520
always supports me and
nurtures me, and never treats

19:47.554 --> 19:50.557
me like dirt beneath her feet.

19:50.590 --> 19:51.924
There you go,
you thought of it.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.560
[laughter]

19:53.593 --> 19:56.128
Now-- now don't hog
all the dark meat.

19:56.162 --> 19:58.064
[laughter]

20:02.168 --> 20:03.736
What'd he say?

20:03.770 --> 20:05.405
He said they
don't know anything,

20:05.438 --> 20:08.975
and that I have to
have another amnio.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.910
So we gotta keep waiting?

20:10.943 --> 20:13.813
Yeah.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.315
I don't even want
to deal with this.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.449
I don't even wanna
think about it.

20:16.483 --> 20:17.884
[baby crying]

20:21.454 --> 20:26.426
He, uh-- he, uh,
knew the sex, but I--

20:26.459 --> 20:27.460
I didn't want him to tell me.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.873
[baby crying]

20:43.443 --> 20:45.845
[music playing]

20:49.916 --> 20:52.385
[music playing]

20:52.419 --> 20:53.353
There.

20:53.386 --> 20:55.355
What do you think?

20:55.388 --> 20:57.790
Oh, I think you
did a great job.

20:57.824 --> 21:01.328
You know what, I think you're a
chick trapped in a wuss's body.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.662
[laughter]

21:03.763 --> 21:05.298
Come on, Mark, I
fixed your pants.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.233
How about giving me a
break and fixing my car?

21:07.266 --> 21:08.167
Well, I'll tell you what.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.436
I'm going out to
dinner with Becky.

21:09.469 --> 21:12.004
And when I get back,
I'll think about it.

21:12.038 --> 21:12.905
All right.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.374
You got a loose thread here.

21:14.407 --> 21:15.308
Hold on.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.208
[laughter]

21:16.242 --> 21:17.544
[tearing]

21:20.447 --> 21:22.181
You know, I am
pretty good at this.

21:22.214 --> 21:23.416
You're pathetic.

21:23.450 --> 21:24.551
[laughter]

21:30.056 --> 21:31.458
[music playing]

21:54.347 --> 21:57.016
[music playing]
