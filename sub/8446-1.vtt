WEBVTT

02:50.029 --> 02:51.729
Mr. Carey?

02:53.266 --> 02:55.566
Can I get a ride home?

02:57.537 --> 02:59.572
Okay, look, I know you
asked me for a ride home

02:59.573 --> 03:02.306
to try to convince me
to change my mind.

03:03.176 --> 03:05.142
But I can't do that.

03:05.712 --> 03:07.447
I know it's hard, Mister,

03:07.448 --> 03:11.117
but maybe repeating 8th grade
is exactly what you need.

03:11.118 --> 03:12.752
When you were offered after
school help, you refused it.

03:12.753 --> 03:14.253
That's... That's fine.

03:14.254 --> 03:16.322
That was your right.
We can't force it on you,

03:16.323 --> 03:20.191
but now you have to accept the
consequences of that choice.

03:21.227 --> 03:23.394
I can't pass you.

03:24.364 --> 03:27.266
But I am willing to do
what I can to help you.

03:27.267 --> 03:29.633
It's plain to see that you need it.

03:33.072 --> 03:35.139
Fuck you.

03:42.515 --> 03:44.484
Get the hell out of my car!

05:21.781 --> 05:23.216
Yo, what about my son, man?

05:23.217 --> 05:24.350
What about your son?

05:24.351 --> 05:25.785
It's just me and him.
Let me go.

05:25.786 --> 05:27.520
You can't lock me up.
I'm all he's got.

05:27.521 --> 05:29.155
Man, don't worry about your son.

05:29.156 --> 05:31.124
If you cooperate, then maybe
your ass will see him later.

05:31.125 --> 05:33.693
They're gonna take care
of him over at Riverview.

05:33.694 --> 05:35.628
Riverview? Hell, no!
Hey!

05:35.629 --> 05:38.397
Daddy, don't let them take me!

05:43.569 --> 05:44.704
Don't let them take me there!

05:44.705 --> 05:46.539
TJ, relax. Take care.

05:46.540 --> 05:49.020
Look, man, you trying to take my
son and put him in the system?

05:53.579 --> 05:55.646
Go ahead. Watch your feet.

05:55.648 --> 05:57.615
Get in!

06:01.188 --> 06:02.688
Was he beating up on you?

06:06.360 --> 06:07.593
Did he hit you?
Yeah, he hit me.

06:07.594 --> 06:10.329
He hit you?

06:10.330 --> 06:12.231
Okay, that... I mean,
that's domestic violence.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.267
Listen,

06:17.603 --> 06:20.471
I need to talk to you

06:20.940 --> 06:24.243
about the acting
auditions on August 7th.

06:24.244 --> 06:26.579
Remember I told you about the
TV show in Beverly Hills?

06:26.580 --> 06:28.781
The auditions are downtown,

06:28.782 --> 06:30.216
and how you're gonna take me to
the auditions and you would...

06:30.217 --> 06:32.616
Yeah, I know, Mister.

07:05.484 --> 07:09.753
Why is Pete in my room
on my PlayStation?

07:09.922 --> 07:12.223
Yo!

07:13.593 --> 07:15.659
Go get something for dinner.

07:16.362 --> 07:17.663
You don't you have any real money?

07:17.664 --> 07:20.564
This is real money, Mister.

07:24.737 --> 07:26.339
Straight up, I'm not
babysitting, dude.

07:26.340 --> 07:29.640
Mister, take Pete with you.

08:04.944 --> 08:07.411
What you looking at, chopstick?

08:14.887 --> 08:16.022
What'd you say to him?

08:16.023 --> 08:18.391
I didn't say anything. He stole.

08:18.392 --> 08:19.792
What?
He stole.

08:19.793 --> 08:21.692
Shut up.

08:24.764 --> 08:27.633
And who told you to play
with my PlayStation, anyway?

08:27.634 --> 08:29.035
Don't ever touch my stuff.

08:49.690 --> 08:51.857
Denied. Insufficient funds.

08:51.858 --> 08:53.926
What?
The card is out of money.

08:53.927 --> 08:54.994
I will need another
form of payment.

08:54.995 --> 08:56.929
Fuck that.

08:56.930 --> 08:59.732
Excuse me? Again, please.

08:59.733 --> 09:03.100
Nothing. Just give
me back the card.

09:03.102 --> 09:04.737
You know what?

09:04.738 --> 09:06.939
I think I'll give it
to its rightful owner.

09:06.940 --> 09:08.441
But it's my mom's, yo.

09:08.442 --> 09:10.443
First of all, I am not your "Yo".

09:10.444 --> 09:13.012
Second, tell your mom to come
and get it if she wants it.

09:13.013 --> 09:14.580
But not you.
You are banned.

09:14.581 --> 09:15.981
Banned?
Banned for what?

09:15.982 --> 09:17.550
Just leave before I
call the police.

09:17.551 --> 09:19.851
But I didn't do...
Leave!

09:19.852 --> 09:21.920
Why are you banned?

09:21.921 --> 09:24.455
Why are you banned, Mister?

09:25.391 --> 09:28.559
That's him.
The one who stole.

09:29.061 --> 09:31.497
Yo, you don't snitch, all right?

09:31.498 --> 09:33.766
But stealing's wrong.

09:33.767 --> 09:37.402
Look, people do what they have
to do to survive out here.

09:37.403 --> 09:39.438
It's candy.

09:39.439 --> 09:41.540
What are you talking about?
It's candy.

09:41.541 --> 09:43.109
I heard you, man.

09:43.110 --> 09:45.709
Annoying as hell. Damn!

09:56.088 --> 09:58.555
Stay here.

10:36.996 --> 10:39.196
The card is out of money.

10:43.068 --> 10:44.936
What?

10:44.937 --> 10:47.072
The welfare card.

10:47.073 --> 10:50.207
Dude at the store said you
have to come and get it.

10:52.978 --> 10:55.481
Where's Peter?

10:55.482 --> 10:58.515
I don't know. Somewhere.

10:59.919 --> 11:02.553
I'm right here, Mister.

11:08.727 --> 11:10.729
Why's he here anyway?

11:10.730 --> 11:13.530
If I'm babysitting, his mom's
is gonna pay me for real.

11:14.733 --> 11:16.600
She give you money to pay me?

11:18.170 --> 11:20.637
We're going out to eat.

11:21.807 --> 11:23.776
What?

11:23.777 --> 11:27.079
Go clean up. We're going to eat.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.981
We don't have money
to go out to eat!

11:28.982 --> 11:32.549
Hey!
Don't talk to me like that.

11:40.626 --> 11:42.659
How are you, Peter?

11:42.661 --> 11:44.995
Good. Thanks.

11:59.011 --> 12:01.080
How was school today, Mister?

12:01.081 --> 12:03.647
Same as always.

12:03.649 --> 12:05.849
It was the last day, right?

12:06.051 --> 12:08.519
Guess you're a freshman now.

12:12.558 --> 12:14.625
You know Curtis from our building?

12:15.227 --> 12:17.694
What about him?

12:18.097 --> 12:19.998
He got nabbed today.

12:19.999 --> 12:22.065
He did?

12:22.201 --> 12:23.135
What for?

12:23.136 --> 12:25.569
What do you think?

12:28.707 --> 12:31.643
They took his son to Riverview.

12:31.644 --> 12:33.879
Dude's like my age.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.814
I always heard Curtis was
into some bad stuff.

12:35.815 --> 12:38.782
He should have known his
ass would end up in jail.

12:39.552 --> 12:42.819
He works for the same
drug-dealing pimp you work for.

12:43.789 --> 12:46.323
Eat your cheeseburger, Mister.

12:48.661 --> 12:50.661
And what about his son?

12:51.697 --> 12:54.565
He's stuck at the worst
group home in the world.

12:55.167 --> 12:58.037
He deserves that because
his pop's a screw-up?

12:58.038 --> 13:01.705
Jesus, would you eat your
goddamn food and shut up?

13:07.346 --> 13:09.980
I'll be back in a minute.

13:42.948 --> 13:45.115
Yeah.

13:47.252 --> 13:50.220
Yeah.

14:25.257 --> 14:27.924
Why're you here?

14:32.364 --> 14:34.299
Eat the rest.

14:34.300 --> 14:36.001
That's okay.
I'm... I'm full.

14:36.002 --> 14:38.335
Eat the rest. Now!

14:57.122 --> 14:58.290
Let's go.

14:58.291 --> 15:00.292
No. Pete's not done.

15:00.293 --> 15:02.327
He's not wasting that food.

15:02.328 --> 15:04.329
He can take it with him, Mister.

15:04.330 --> 15:08.266
He's not taking it with him.
He's eating it now!

15:08.267 --> 15:10.703
Finish it!

15:10.704 --> 15:12.438
What the hell is wrong with you?

15:12.439 --> 15:14.006
What the hell is wrong with you?

15:14.007 --> 15:16.139
Sucking dick in the bathroom!

17:26.271 --> 17:28.438
Keep the change.

17:29.975 --> 17:31.977
Think big.
Think positive.

17:31.978 --> 17:34.413
Always go for the throat.

17:34.414 --> 17:36.415
Buy low, sell high.

17:36.416 --> 17:39.251
Fear? That's the
other guy's problem.

17:39.252 --> 17:41.119
Nothing you have ever experienced

17:41.120 --> 17:43.388
will prepare you for the absolute
carnage you are about to witness.

17:43.389 --> 17:46.325
Super Bowl, World Series,
they don't know what pressure is.

17:46.326 --> 17:48.493
In this building, it's
either kill or be killed.

17:48.494 --> 17:51.029
You make no friends in the pits
and you take no prisoners.

17:51.030 --> 17:52.564
One minute you're up half
a million in soybeans

17:52.565 --> 17:54.366
and the next, boom, your
kids don't go to college

17:54.367 --> 17:56.602
and they've repossessed your
Bentley. Are you with me?

17:56.603 --> 17:59.304
Yeah, we got to kill the motherf...
We got to kill 'em!

17:59.305 --> 18:02.407
They want you to buy
as much OJ as you can,

18:02.408 --> 18:04.574
the instant trading stock.

18:18.257 --> 18:20.626
Stay here.
I'll be back.

18:20.627 --> 18:22.527
Is it all right if I have
some water maybe?

18:22.528 --> 18:25.262
Man, I don't care.

18:34.039 --> 18:36.074
Hey, do me a favor.

18:36.075 --> 18:38.243
What?
Run in there and get me a paper.

18:38.244 --> 18:41.144
For what?
To read, why else?

18:43.682 --> 18:45.417
Where that Chinese nigga at?

18:45.418 --> 18:47.286
He's not Chinese.

18:47.287 --> 18:49.021
Where he at?
Why?

18:49.022 --> 18:50.622
Because I don't like
him, that's why.

18:50.623 --> 18:52.257
Something fishy about that nigga.

18:52.258 --> 18:54.293
Man, whatever, yo.

18:54.294 --> 18:56.228
Why you can't just go in
there and get it yourself?

18:56.229 --> 18:57.529
Man, what's with all
the questions, man?

18:57.530 --> 18:59.464
You gonna help me out or not?

18:59.465 --> 19:04.467
I ain't gonna be your paperboy and
shit. How's that supposed to look?

19:05.237 --> 19:07.072
Man, whatever, Dip Stick.

19:07.073 --> 19:10.640
What? What you call me?
Punk motherfucker!

19:13.946 --> 19:16.281
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

19:16.282 --> 19:18.650
Oh, okay.
We'll see!

19:18.651 --> 19:20.550
We'll see!

19:42.174 --> 19:46.376
We're out of cereal and
milk and everything.

19:49.715 --> 19:51.550
Take the card and go to the store.

19:51.551 --> 19:54.019
I told you.
Dude at the store took it.

19:54.020 --> 19:56.286
You have to go get it.

19:58.056 --> 20:00.525
I circled the ones you can do.

20:00.526 --> 20:02.761
They probably don't care
about background checks.

20:02.762 --> 20:05.030
This is what you think of me?

20:05.031 --> 20:06.631
I wasn't about to circle rocket
scientist if that's what you mean.

20:06.632 --> 20:08.200
Mister, what's your problem?

20:08.201 --> 20:10.469
My problem?

20:10.470 --> 20:15.673
You are gonna stop talking to
me like I'm your goddamn child.

20:15.674 --> 20:17.542
I'm your mother.

20:17.543 --> 20:20.410
You think I'm satisfied
with this life?

20:20.645 --> 20:23.115
I'm not.

20:23.116 --> 20:25.150
I'm just trying to
get things in order.

20:25.151 --> 20:27.285
You been saying that
for how long now?

20:27.286 --> 20:28.787
I'm sick of hearing it.

20:28.788 --> 20:31.156
You know what I'm sick of?

20:31.157 --> 20:32.657
I'm sick of you.

20:32.658 --> 20:35.625
You and your smartass mouth.

20:35.727 --> 20:38.563
You keep on talking shit,

20:38.564 --> 20:40.665
I'm gonna kick your
nappy-head ass out for good.

20:40.666 --> 20:43.600
What's the difference?
I'll be better off.

20:43.602 --> 20:45.704
That's the shit I'm talking about.

20:45.705 --> 20:48.040
You just know
everything, don't you?

20:48.041 --> 20:50.240
Don't you?

21:00.318 --> 21:02.685
I do what I do

21:03.488 --> 21:06.089
'cause ain't nobody gonna help me.

21:08.260 --> 21:11.528
They never have.
They never will.

21:22.140 --> 21:24.307
Mister,

21:24.342 --> 21:26.843
take Pete and go.

21:28.780 --> 21:30.515
You're disgusting.

21:30.516 --> 21:33.149
I wish you would just die already.

21:39.257 --> 21:42.092
At least we have that in common.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.366
Take Pete and go.

22:05.250 --> 22:06.485
That's B-Ball.

22:06.486 --> 22:09.521
B-Ball?
Like basketball?

22:09.522 --> 22:12.157
No, like Bernard Ball.
That's his name.

22:12.158 --> 22:13.892
Stay right here, right next to him.

22:13.893 --> 22:16.726
Why?
So no one messes with you.

22:19.264 --> 22:21.865
Can't I come with you, Mister?
Hell, no!

22:22.667 --> 22:25.203
Why is he staring at you like that?

22:25.204 --> 22:26.905
He always does that.

22:28.407 --> 22:30.475
In like 10 minutes, head back up.

22:30.476 --> 22:32.277
She probably won't even
know you're there.

22:32.278 --> 22:33.545
Grab some jelly from the fridge,

22:33.546 --> 22:36.746
grab some bread, make a sandwich.

23:40.946 --> 23:41.980
Alice.

24:36.768 --> 24:39.270
Come for a ride with me, Mister.

24:39.271 --> 24:41.306
What's up, Alice?

24:41.307 --> 24:43.008
Let's go for a ride.

24:43.009 --> 24:45.510
I got my board.

24:45.511 --> 24:48.378
I see. You got something
better going on or what?

24:54.019 --> 24:55.820
All right.

24:55.821 --> 24:58.288
I can kick it with
you for a minute.

24:58.757 --> 24:59.758
He with you?

24:59.759 --> 25:01.891
Who?

25:12.637 --> 25:14.439
You sure you don't
wanna check on her?

25:14.440 --> 25:16.408
Nah, she's all right.

25:16.409 --> 25:18.409
She's probably asleep.

25:18.410 --> 25:20.712
She works nights, so...

25:20.713 --> 25:23.579
I saw you when I was
getting ready for my run.

25:24.049 --> 25:25.849
You see me?

25:25.850 --> 25:28.651
When I was skating?

25:28.653 --> 25:29.954
I thought maybe that was you.

25:29.955 --> 25:32.755
I see you out there
every Saturday, Mister.

25:34.793 --> 25:37.527
You wanna know who that
man I was with is?

25:45.070 --> 25:46.871
Bitch, you think I'm
giving you shit for free?

25:46.872 --> 25:52.442
Say I'll work for it one more
time and I'll fuck your shit up!

26:04.022 --> 26:06.122
You know her?

26:07.826 --> 26:10.126
Yeah, that's... That's...

26:13.932 --> 26:15.567
Nah.

26:15.568 --> 26:17.734
I don't know her.

26:28.646 --> 26:30.713
Go ahead, Pete.

26:37.822 --> 26:40.390
Why do you frown so much?

26:42.160 --> 26:44.460
Doesn't it make your face hurt?

26:44.529 --> 26:47.630
Anyways...
Anyways.

26:49.734 --> 26:51.934
I miss you, knucklehead.

26:52.504 --> 26:54.439
I miss hanging out in our building.

26:54.440 --> 26:57.006
You were always so sweet to me.

26:57.675 --> 27:01.010
Just tell me you miss me too.

27:01.579 --> 27:03.513
I guess.

27:05.150 --> 27:07.986
I don't know.

27:07.987 --> 27:10.789
I really haven't seen you
since you dropped out

27:10.790 --> 27:13.156
and moved out of our building.

27:13.191 --> 27:15.491
You got a maid now.

27:15.493 --> 27:17.160
So...

27:20.598 --> 27:22.665
Look in that duffel bag over there.

27:46.090 --> 27:48.524
It's yours if you want it.

27:49.027 --> 27:51.160
Where'd you get all this?

28:02.106 --> 28:04.007
You got to go.

28:04.008 --> 28:06.110
Take the bag.

28:06.111 --> 28:09.512
I might not be able to take this
stuff on the plane to Beverly Hills.

28:12.251 --> 28:15.119
Maybe you can sell it.

28:15.120 --> 28:18.521
Tell your mom thank you for
the donuts and milk, please.

28:19.090 --> 28:21.526
I live by myself, Pete.

28:21.527 --> 28:24.093
Your parents let you
live by yourself?

28:25.230 --> 28:27.597
Come on.

28:36.107 --> 28:38.610
Oh, have fun at Riverview.

28:38.611 --> 28:42.247
Word got out.
Curtis sung like a jay bird.

28:42.248 --> 28:46.650
Anybody and everybody that works
for Kris, boom, they're out of here.

28:46.651 --> 28:48.720
Everybody know your
mom ho for that cat.

28:48.721 --> 28:50.255
She going to jail.

28:50.256 --> 28:52.522
Where you think you're going, huh?

28:53.591 --> 28:54.859
It's inevitable.

28:54.860 --> 28:57.159
Inevitable, baby!

29:26.991 --> 29:29.125
Hey!

29:30.929 --> 29:33.129
What is it now?

29:45.944 --> 29:48.311
Come on, Pete!

29:53.918 --> 29:55.186
Go, go.

29:58.957 --> 30:01.090
Shh!

30:03.161 --> 30:05.597
Open up!

30:05.598 --> 30:07.730
Who is it?

30:08.866 --> 30:11.701
Open up!

30:14.939 --> 30:16.774
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

30:16.775 --> 30:18.142
Hold on, I'm coming.

30:18.143 --> 30:20.343
Hurry up!

30:22.947 --> 30:24.749
We have a warrant to
search the premises.

30:24.750 --> 30:27.016
I'm gonna need you to sit down.

30:28.052 --> 30:30.121
Yeah, I got the living
room. Let me check.

30:30.122 --> 30:31.956
Hands on your lap, please.

30:31.957 --> 30:34.359
Oh! Oh, yeah.

30:34.360 --> 30:36.359
We got something.

30:39.063 --> 30:40.298
Hey, Sarge.

30:40.299 --> 30:41.933
Found this in the living room.

30:41.934 --> 30:45.668
Syringe, spoon,
lighter's still warm.

30:47.038 --> 30:49.405
Check the bedroom.
All right.

31:01.152 --> 31:03.319
Shit.

31:48.866 --> 31:51.235
Anybody in here?
Aye, Sarge.

31:51.236 --> 31:53.905
Uh, I checked the other
bedroom. It's empty.

31:53.906 --> 31:55.807
Seems to be clear in here as well.

31:55.808 --> 31:58.140
I bet you we just missed him.

31:59.844 --> 32:02.211
The mother's pretty messed up.

32:22.166 --> 32:24.233
Leave him this.

32:25.236 --> 32:28.504
He'll be wondering
where his momma is.

32:33.411 --> 32:35.246
- Take her down.
- Let's go.

32:35.247 --> 32:38.347
And when you see the kid,
make sure you grab him.

32:39.217 --> 32:41.851
- Bring the bag.
- All right. I got it.

33:21.359 --> 33:23.161
You should change.

33:23.162 --> 33:26.328
Can I have some privacy, please?

34:21.887 --> 34:28.092
It's going to be a heat advisory from
noon until 8:00 p.m. on Thursday.

34:28.092 --> 34:29.994
So here's some quick tips for you.

34:29.995 --> 34:31.529
Wear light colored clothing.

34:31.530 --> 34:34.063
It will reflect the sun rays...

34:39.637 --> 34:42.406
Today in New York,
we're already in the 80's,

34:42.407 --> 34:45.509
and we're going for
once again 100 degrees.

34:45.510 --> 34:47.311
This pirate game was
your idea, Timmy.

34:47.312 --> 34:49.179
Besides, it's my favorite color.

34:49.181 --> 34:51.347
Argh!

34:52.382 --> 34:55.386
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

34:55.387 --> 34:58.255
Not so fast, Greenbeard!

34:58.256 --> 35:00.389
En garde!

35:28.286 --> 35:30.452
It's time for you to go home.

35:44.468 --> 35:47.102
I could just stay with you.

35:56.314 --> 35:58.249
She's not home.

35:58.250 --> 36:00.451
Hi, Peter.

36:00.452 --> 36:02.952
Is there something
I can help you with?

36:04.522 --> 36:06.490
How do you know Pete?

36:06.491 --> 36:10.693
I used to babysit for him once
in a while. Right, Peter?

36:13.130 --> 36:15.700
Well can you watch him
until his mom gets here?

36:15.701 --> 36:18.701
I'd be happy to.
Come on, Peter. Come on.

36:51.302 --> 36:53.402
Yeah?

36:57.708 --> 36:59.576
He's filthy.

36:59.577 --> 37:01.710
He needs a bath.

37:04.648 --> 37:06.548
Let's go, Pete.

37:15.126 --> 37:18.394
Oh, I'm gonna call the police.

37:23.667 --> 37:26.070
She ever do stuff to you before?

37:26.071 --> 37:29.440
She makes me sit in the
bathtub with my clothes off.

37:29.441 --> 37:31.540
She ever touch you?

37:37.214 --> 37:38.649
Why didn't you tell me anything?

37:38.650 --> 37:41.717
You said don't snitch.

37:45.256 --> 37:46.290
Come on.

37:46.291 --> 37:49.725
So, I can stay with you?

37:50.561 --> 37:53.664
Moms will be out in a few days.

37:53.665 --> 37:55.266
I'll just pawn some stuff
from around the house

37:55.267 --> 37:57.268
so we can eat till she gets back.

37:57.269 --> 37:59.435
Promise?

37:59.770 --> 38:01.804
Yeah.

38:02.073 --> 38:04.373
Let's go.

38:25.596 --> 38:27.798
I'm just getting some stuff.

38:27.799 --> 38:31.233
No. I need some privacy.

39:01.432 --> 39:04.233
There's a turkey in the freezer.

39:10.307 --> 39:13.575
What? You promised.

39:54.486 --> 39:56.654
See, right there, just like that.

39:56.655 --> 39:58.556
You got to be prepared to run.
Know what I mean?

39:58.557 --> 39:59.623
Why?

39:59.624 --> 40:01.690
You wanna end up in Riverview?

40:02.259 --> 40:04.493
That's why.

40:16.473 --> 40:21.444
"Niggas for life."

40:21.445 --> 40:23.812
What did you say?

40:32.523 --> 40:34.656
You my nigga, Pete?

40:35.492 --> 40:37.761
I'm Korean.

40:37.762 --> 40:40.462
You can still be my nigga.

40:41.365 --> 40:43.832
Do I have to be?

41:07.424 --> 41:09.625
Stay here.

43:13.384 --> 43:15.817
The turkey!

43:19.490 --> 43:21.456
Shit.

43:43.147 --> 43:45.416
Are we going to ask
for help, Mister?

43:45.417 --> 43:47.151
We can't tell anybody
we're on our own.

43:47.152 --> 43:48.886
Don't tell anybody.

43:48.887 --> 43:50.921
Matter of fact, you
don't talk at all.

43:50.922 --> 43:53.023
Housing Authority catches
us out here, that's a wrap.

43:53.024 --> 43:54.491
So we got to lay it low.

43:54.492 --> 43:56.794
Because we might end up
in Riverview, right?

43:56.795 --> 43:58.796
Is it true that two kids
were killed there once?

43:58.797 --> 44:00.531
More than two, Pete.

44:00.532 --> 44:02.565
Way more.

44:02.566 --> 44:05.100
Wait here.

44:09.740 --> 44:11.475
Hey, hey. Told you
not to come in here.

44:11.476 --> 44:12.843
What are you doing here?

44:12.844 --> 44:14.644
I told you you're banned.

44:14.645 --> 44:16.013
Hey, don't touch that.

44:16.014 --> 44:18.115
You put that down.

44:18.116 --> 44:20.651
Hey! Get out of my store!
Hey, nigger.

44:20.652 --> 44:22.186
Hey! Hey!

44:22.187 --> 44:24.519
You little punk!

44:31.228 --> 44:34.730
Look, I'm gonna pay him back
as soon as I get some money.

44:34.731 --> 44:36.232
Really?

44:36.233 --> 44:37.734
Really.

44:37.735 --> 44:40.037
Soon as Mom gets home,
she can take care of it.

44:40.038 --> 44:41.939
Things will be better
when she comes home.

44:41.940 --> 44:43.140
She can take me to my audition.

44:43.141 --> 44:45.008
What audition?

44:45.009 --> 44:47.211
For a TV show I'm going to be on.

44:47.212 --> 44:48.879
I really don't want to get into it.

44:48.880 --> 44:50.848
But it shoots in Beverly Hills.

44:50.849 --> 44:52.783
Maybe I can come, too.

44:52.784 --> 44:58.854
No. When Mommy comes back,
she can take care of your situation.

44:59.189 --> 45:02.190
We just need to make
it another day or two.

45:12.669 --> 45:15.203
Mister! Mister!

45:20.244 --> 45:22.045
That's my mom's friend.

45:24.882 --> 45:26.950
He's not her friend, trust me.

45:26.951 --> 45:28.752
You know him?

45:28.753 --> 45:31.288
Everybody knows him.
That's Kris.

45:31.289 --> 45:33.790
My mom works for him,
your mom works for him.

45:33.791 --> 45:35.526
That's how they know each other.

45:35.527 --> 45:37.995
He's cool. He's been
to my house before.

45:37.996 --> 45:39.897
Maybe he can help us.

45:39.898 --> 45:43.098
Yeah, help us get high or...
What?

45:45.702 --> 45:47.037
We don't need his help.

45:47.038 --> 45:49.170
We gonna put their face down.

45:50.173 --> 45:52.008
Better write that in stone.

45:52.009 --> 45:54.142
Let's go.

46:04.121 --> 46:06.321
Thank you.

46:06.957 --> 46:09.190
What's up, Henry?

46:09.660 --> 46:11.028
What's up, what?

46:11.029 --> 46:12.930
I'm here to work this corner.

46:12.931 --> 46:14.698
Too bad.

46:14.699 --> 46:17.568
"Too bad?" What do you mean
"Too bad"? I'm here to work it.

46:17.569 --> 46:19.102
Tough cookie, Mister.
Tough cookie?

46:19.103 --> 46:20.938
Yeah.

46:20.939 --> 46:22.105
Tough cookie.

46:22.106 --> 46:23.774
Now move on.

46:23.775 --> 46:25.941
I don't have time for
your crap today.

46:27.744 --> 46:29.780
Crap? What crap?

46:29.781 --> 46:31.315
You know what?
Stop doing that.

46:31.316 --> 46:32.649
Stop repeating everything I say.

46:32.650 --> 46:33.617
I hear what you're trying to do.

46:33.618 --> 46:35.652
Man, what's your problem, yo?

46:35.653 --> 46:37.287
And push your lips
back into your face!

46:37.288 --> 46:39.022
You think you can intimidate
people into giving you a handout?

46:39.023 --> 46:40.357
Nobody owe you nothing!

46:40.358 --> 46:42.993
Man, whatever, yo.
Yeah, whatever. Move on.

46:42.994 --> 46:46.261
I'm working this spot. You can go
find yourself your own corner.

46:46.897 --> 46:49.130
What war?

46:49.600 --> 46:51.733
What war, Henry?

46:51.902 --> 46:53.070
What's it to you?

46:53.071 --> 46:55.236
You're a veteran.

46:55.238 --> 46:57.372
What war, Henry?

46:58.075 --> 47:00.275
You better get the
hell out of here.

47:00.310 --> 47:02.344
That's what I thought.

47:02.746 --> 47:05.213
You're the real scumbag, Henry.

47:06.917 --> 47:09.217
Come on, Pete.

47:10.087 --> 47:12.253
Real respectful, Mister.

47:13.023 --> 47:14.958
You're a real winner.

47:14.959 --> 47:17.960
Eat a dick, tough cookie.

47:17.961 --> 47:20.061
What?

47:36.813 --> 47:39.280
$17.

47:49.926 --> 47:53.195
Mister, how long has
your mom been gone?

47:53.196 --> 47:54.931
I don't know.

47:54.932 --> 47:57.134
Usually they keep her
for a day or two,

47:57.135 --> 47:59.701
never more than two weeks.

48:00.203 --> 48:02.771
It's been longer than that.

48:04.675 --> 48:07.008
Hey, look down and keep walking.

48:20.190 --> 48:22.824
Motherfuck.

48:31.868 --> 48:33.835
Crap.

48:55.225 --> 48:57.794
Yes.

48:57.795 --> 49:01.196
I'm calling to check on the
status of Gloria Winfield.

49:03.300 --> 49:05.366
She was booked,

49:06.069 --> 49:08.737
about three weeks ago.

49:09.272 --> 49:11.406
I'm her brother.

49:15.212 --> 49:16.980
Okay.

49:30.293 --> 49:32.861
She was let go a week ago.

49:32.996 --> 49:35.263
That's good.

49:39.269 --> 49:42.270
So where is she?

49:44.808 --> 49:48.512
Yo, when was the last
time you took a shower?

49:48.513 --> 49:52.013
I took a shower.
But there was no soap.

49:52.149 --> 49:53.984
You smell vicious.

49:53.985 --> 49:56.551
There's no toilet paper either.

50:07.564 --> 50:10.231
Privacy, please.

50:18.909 --> 50:22.345
"An actor must know how to live
truthfully under imaginary circumstances.

50:22.346 --> 50:25.916
"You don't pretend to be the
character. You are the character.

50:25.917 --> 50:28.451
"You must learn how to use
the reality in front of you.

50:28.452 --> 50:31.986
"They say we belong to the life we're
living and the world of the story.

50:32.923 --> 50:37.192
"You don't pretend to be the
character. You are the character.

50:37.994 --> 50:39.963
"Who am I?

50:39.964 --> 50:42.164
"Where am I?

50:42.165 --> 50:44.501
"What am I doing here?"

51:54.237 --> 51:57.205
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go, let's go!

52:29.205 --> 52:31.239
Ready?

52:36.212 --> 52:38.448
Yo, what's taking so long?

52:38.449 --> 52:40.617
This one is different than ours.

52:40.618 --> 52:43.653
And I only did that because
my mom took my key.

52:43.654 --> 52:46.988
And I never did it
wearing pantyhose before.

52:47.590 --> 52:49.958
Can you do it or not?

53:48.318 --> 53:50.451
Hey, Pete.

54:01.464 --> 54:04.799
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mister.

54:06.102 --> 54:08.571
I don't want to do this anymore.

54:08.572 --> 54:12.141
Put the food back.
Nobody needs to know that we were here.

54:12.142 --> 54:14.308
I got another idea.

54:14.577 --> 54:17.412
Hey...

54:18.448 --> 54:21.051
It's over.
Everybody's all right.

54:21.052 --> 54:22.717
Okay?

54:32.262 --> 54:35.663
No. No, keep those.

54:55.718 --> 54:58.154
You got the power.
We got the power.

54:58.155 --> 55:00.488
We all got the power.

55:00.790 --> 55:03.193
You got the power.
We got the power.

55:03.194 --> 55:04.794
We all got the power.

55:10.600 --> 55:12.569
You got the power.
We got the power.

55:12.570 --> 55:15.371
We all got the power.

55:15.372 --> 55:17.207
You got the power.
We got the power.

55:17.208 --> 55:19.640
We all got the power.

55:22.779 --> 55:25.181
I can act. I can sing!

55:25.182 --> 55:27.849
I even do impersonations.

55:30.153 --> 55:32.520
Pick somebody.

55:33.156 --> 55:35.389
Will Smith.

55:43.766 --> 55:47.135
You know what the difference
is between you and me?

55:52.842 --> 55:55.576
I make this look good.

55:57.514 --> 56:00.183
You wanna hear my monologue?

56:00.184 --> 56:01.284
What's that?

56:01.285 --> 56:03.453
It's like this long speech.

56:03.454 --> 56:05.288
You use it to show you can act.

56:05.289 --> 56:08.525
I picked mine from Fargo.
You ever see that?

56:08.526 --> 56:10.727
Hmm, nah.
I don't think so.

56:10.728 --> 56:12.362
It's hilarious.

56:12.363 --> 56:15.897
About these Minnesota
people with funny accents.

56:25.376 --> 56:30.547
I guess you think, you're a, you
know, like an authority figure.

56:30.548 --> 56:32.949
With that stupid fuckin' uniform.
Huh, buddy?

56:32.950 --> 56:37.554
King clip-on tie here.
Big fuckin' man, huh?

56:37.555 --> 56:40.390
You know these are the
limits of your life, man.

56:40.391 --> 56:41.925
Ruler of your little
fuckin' gate here.

56:41.926 --> 56:43.393
Here!

56:43.394 --> 56:48.462
Here's your $4, you
pathetic piece of shit.

56:49.632 --> 56:52.366
That's very good, Mister.

57:21.698 --> 57:24.765
I'm going to get us a
real house, Mister.

57:26.736 --> 57:30.807
I'm gonna get a job, and I'm
gonna stop doing drugs.

57:30.808 --> 57:34.375
And I'm gonna stop selling
myself for money.

57:36.246 --> 57:38.713
I'm just trying to
get things in order.

57:39.782 --> 57:43.484
You won't have to be ashamed
to be my son no more.

57:43.987 --> 57:47.588
Now run. Run, Mister.

57:50.460 --> 57:52.994
I need time alone.

57:58.701 --> 58:01.535
That's tight, right?

58:23.559 --> 58:25.960
See?

58:26.996 --> 58:29.363
Yeah.

58:44.614 --> 58:46.681
Mister?

58:48.084 --> 58:52.453
Is it okay not to love your mom?

59:01.597 --> 59:05.399
I mean, you can't help
but love her, Pete.

59:07.403 --> 59:09.737
But you don't have to like her.

59:22.952 --> 59:26.053
Ready?
Ready.

59:29.492 --> 59:31.060
Go, Sarah! Go, Sarah!
Come on, Sarah.

59:31.061 --> 59:33.062
Come on, Sarah.
Turn around.

59:33.063 --> 59:34.597
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.
Come on, turn around.

59:34.598 --> 59:36.399
You can do this.

59:36.400 --> 59:37.633
Let's go, baby. Let's go.

59:37.634 --> 59:40.470
Go. Go. Keep rolling!
Keep rolling.

59:40.471 --> 59:42.839
Come on, Sarah.
Keep rolling! Come on, baby.

59:42.840 --> 59:44.540
Go Sarah.
Sarah, keep moving!

59:44.541 --> 59:46.743
Sarah, knock everything down.

59:46.744 --> 59:48.478
Go, Sarah!

59:48.479 --> 59:50.079
Keep going! You're almost there!

59:50.080 --> 59:52.548
Go! Go! Go! Go!

59:52.549 --> 59:53.983
Sarah, you're almost there.

59:57.019 --> 59:58.688
Yes!
Yes!

59:58.689 --> 01:00:00.957
Whoa!
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:00:00.958 --> 01:00:04.658
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:00:31.821 --> 01:00:33.854
Come with me.

01:01:55.771 --> 01:01:58.138
You need help?

01:01:58.908 --> 01:02:00.543
What?

01:02:00.544 --> 01:02:02.610
Can I help you?

01:02:02.645 --> 01:02:04.580
No, we got it.

01:02:04.581 --> 01:02:05.248
Let me see what you've got there.

01:02:05.249 --> 01:02:06.782
We're good, man.

01:02:06.783 --> 01:02:09.950
Let me see the card, please.

01:02:20.296 --> 01:02:22.696
I know it don't make sense.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.936
Two kids shopping for groceries
in the middle of the night.

01:02:26.937 --> 01:02:28.771
But where we're from,

01:02:28.772 --> 01:02:32.975
you don't want people seeing
what you bring into your home.

01:02:32.976 --> 01:02:35.976
They'll rob you blind for a
carton of milk if they have to.

01:02:37.113 --> 01:02:39.613
So, we shop while they sleep.

01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:44.552
Plus my mom, she works two jobs
and she doesn't have time.

01:02:44.754 --> 01:02:47.290
And tomorrow is her birthday.

01:02:47.291 --> 01:02:51.825
I wanted to get groceries and have a
big breakfast for when she comes home.

01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:57.565
I just wanted to do one thing

01:02:58.234 --> 01:03:01.602
so she'd have one less
thing to worry about.

01:03:12.148 --> 01:03:14.682
Tell your mom happy birthday.

01:03:17.086 --> 01:03:19.353
Thanks.

01:03:29.632 --> 01:03:32.666
And the Oscar goes to...

01:03:52.288 --> 01:03:54.688
All right.

01:03:54.957 --> 01:03:57.124
You can come if you want.

01:03:57.994 --> 01:03:59.794
Come where?

01:03:59.795 --> 01:04:02.162
Beverly Hills.

01:04:02.898 --> 01:04:05.065
I do want to.

01:04:05.701 --> 01:04:09.203
In like a month I
should have the part.

01:04:09.739 --> 01:04:12.172
August 7th.

01:04:12.842 --> 01:04:15.275
August 7th.

01:04:41.871 --> 01:04:43.873
What are you doing?

01:04:43.874 --> 01:04:46.207
Didn't I tell you stop
playing games with me?

01:04:46.208 --> 01:04:48.876
They're for you.

01:05:00.423 --> 01:05:02.425
What'd you do to them?

01:05:02.426 --> 01:05:05.092
If you don't want 'em
I'll take 'em back.

01:05:29.819 --> 01:05:32.019
God bless you, Mister.

01:05:42.898 --> 01:05:45.365
Come on, man! Come on!

01:05:59.782 --> 01:06:02.983
Yo, come on! Come on!

01:06:47.062 --> 01:06:49.096
Something's wrong.

01:07:07.316 --> 01:07:09.385
What are you going to do?
Stay here.

01:07:09.386 --> 01:07:11.153
Where are you going?
I got to save the food.

01:07:14.857 --> 01:07:17.126
Hey! Get out of my store.

01:07:17.127 --> 01:07:18.894
I just need some ice and
a big cooler. That's all.

01:07:18.895 --> 01:07:20.362
Get out!

01:07:20.363 --> 01:07:22.531
Yo, please don't be the
asshole right now, all right?

01:07:22.532 --> 01:07:25.866
I am not the asshole.
You're the asshole.

01:07:25.868 --> 01:07:28.137
I can pay you.

01:07:28.138 --> 01:07:31.340
I just need some ice.
Come on, man.

01:07:31.341 --> 01:07:35.542
Look, if you don't get out of my
store right now, I swear to God...

01:07:42.918 --> 01:07:45.419
Don't even think about it.

01:08:06.642 --> 01:08:09.610
You had to be the asshole.

01:08:20.154 --> 01:08:22.057
Hold on one second.

01:08:22.058 --> 01:08:25.058
Yo, Housing Authority
know you out here?

01:08:25.227 --> 01:08:27.429
Shut the hell up, Dip Stick.

01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:29.198
What'd you call me? Dip Stick?

01:08:29.198 --> 01:08:31.000
What the hell that mean?

01:08:31.001 --> 01:08:34.067
Leave me alone.
Why you call me Dip Stick?

01:08:37.439 --> 01:08:39.939
What you looking at?

01:08:40.042 --> 01:08:42.309
You broke into my apartment?

01:08:42.978 --> 01:08:45.948
Yeah. Yeah, I did that.

01:08:45.948 --> 01:08:48.183
It's not like you had
anything worth shit.

01:08:48.184 --> 01:08:50.586
I stole all your stuff and all I
have is these Kicks to show for it.

01:08:50.587 --> 01:08:53.322
You dirty ass.

01:08:53.323 --> 01:08:54.924
You need to get out of my face.
What are you gonna do?

01:08:54.925 --> 01:08:56.492
You gonna do something?
You gonna do something?

01:08:56.493 --> 01:08:58.294
You gonna do something, huh?

01:08:58.295 --> 01:09:00.294
You little mother...

01:09:00.296 --> 01:09:02.298
Come here!

01:09:02.299 --> 01:09:06.335
Don't you ever call
me Dip Stick again!

01:09:06.336 --> 01:09:08.569
You hear me? You hear me talking
to you? You hear me talking to you?

01:09:08.571 --> 01:09:10.171
Stop!

01:09:10.173 --> 01:09:11.640
Stop it!
Shut up!

01:09:14.411 --> 01:09:16.312
- Come here! Yeah, I'm good, right?
- Hey!

01:09:16.313 --> 01:09:18.180
Stop!

01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:19.615
You hear me talking to you?
Hey!

01:09:19.616 --> 01:09:23.152
Hey, get off!
Get off of him!

01:09:23.153 --> 01:09:26.121
I'm gonna see you again, Mister.
I'm gonna see you again.

01:09:26.122 --> 01:09:27.723
What was that about?
Let me help you.

01:09:27.724 --> 01:09:30.426
Let me help you.
Get off me!

01:09:30.426 --> 01:09:31.359
You think I'm a charity case!

01:09:31.361 --> 01:09:33.028
What? No I just...

01:09:33.029 --> 01:09:35.197
I just wanna talk to you.
Yeah, you do!

01:09:35.198 --> 01:09:37.198
You do!

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.666
You know, maybe it isn't
all about you, Mister.

01:09:40.269 --> 01:09:43.636
Alice! Hold on. Wait!

01:09:45.174 --> 01:09:47.441
Wait...

01:09:59.155 --> 01:10:05.094
We're looking at one or two thunderstorms
developing as the day goes on.

01:10:05.095 --> 01:10:08.130
Temperatures by then
in the mid-nineties.

01:10:08.131 --> 01:10:09.732
So it looks like August
is going to start

01:10:09.733 --> 01:10:12.001
just as hot as July ended.

01:10:12.002 --> 01:10:13.669
Unfortunately the summer
heat wave continues

01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:16.503
and shows no signs of letting up.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.673
Mister, open the door.

01:11:25.674 --> 01:11:27.607
I'm sorry.

01:11:48.297 --> 01:11:50.397
No, no, no. Don't open that.

01:12:09.384 --> 01:12:11.520
You wanna help me
clean it up, Pete?

01:12:11.521 --> 01:12:15.455
Okay. But can I finish
my food first, please?

01:12:24.366 --> 01:12:26.301
I want to bring you some stuff.

01:12:26.302 --> 01:12:27.636
I'll even let you pay me back.

01:12:27.637 --> 01:12:30.672
- Why?
- Why? Why what?

01:12:30.673 --> 01:12:33.207
Why do you keep trying to help me?

01:12:33.208 --> 01:12:36.145
You are my friend, got it?

01:12:36.146 --> 01:12:37.346
So don't ever make me feel bad

01:12:37.347 --> 01:12:40.280
for wanting to help you again.

01:12:40.782 --> 01:12:44.485
You're gonna miss me
when I'm in Beverly Hills.

01:12:44.486 --> 01:12:46.255
I know you're not moving, Mister.

01:12:46.256 --> 01:12:47.422
I am.

01:12:47.423 --> 01:12:51.191
Me and Pete. August 7th.

01:12:51.927 --> 01:12:54.229
So you'll be here in a
couple hours, then?

01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:57.164
You can come, too.

01:12:58.167 --> 01:13:01.703
As fun as that sounds,
I can't come with you.

01:13:01.704 --> 01:13:03.704
Why?

01:13:03.705 --> 01:13:05.605
What is it?

01:13:06.341 --> 01:13:09.276
He wants me to move in with him.

01:13:09.945 --> 01:13:11.847
You're not doing that, are you?

01:13:11.848 --> 01:13:13.682
He already left his wife and kids.

01:13:13.683 --> 01:13:15.517
He's married?

01:13:15.518 --> 01:13:16.385
Hell, no, Alice.

01:13:16.386 --> 01:13:19.221
I know...

01:13:19.222 --> 01:13:22.591
I'm going to tell him no.

01:13:22.592 --> 01:13:23.825
I'm leaving him.

01:13:23.826 --> 01:13:24.960
He left his family for you.

01:13:24.961 --> 01:13:26.628
I never asked.

01:13:26.629 --> 01:13:29.631
It's my life, not his.

01:13:29.632 --> 01:13:32.699
I want to find my own way.

01:13:34.603 --> 01:13:37.537
Want me to come with you?

01:13:40.375 --> 01:13:44.311
Thanks, Mister, but I got it.

01:13:44.613 --> 01:13:47.547
When is your mom coming home?

01:13:48.283 --> 01:13:50.750
They let her out of
jail over a month ago.

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:54.255
If she was coming back,

01:13:54.256 --> 01:13:56.791
she probably would have by now.

01:13:56.792 --> 01:13:59.259
Mister, how did you...

01:13:59.728 --> 01:14:01.530
What are you going to do?

01:14:01.531 --> 01:14:03.465
I told you.

01:14:03.466 --> 01:14:06.433
I'm going to Beverly Hills.

01:14:09.938 --> 01:14:12.872
I'll be back in an hour or two.

01:14:31.326 --> 01:14:34.261
I'll be back.

01:14:50.045 --> 01:14:52.681
Muah! Muah!
Muah! Muah!

01:14:52.682 --> 01:14:54.316
What are you laughing at?

01:14:59.721 --> 01:15:02.289
Is she coming?

01:15:04.559 --> 01:15:06.960
She'll be back.

01:15:12.868 --> 01:15:15.470
Is she coming today?

01:15:15.471 --> 01:15:17.706
I don't know.
Probably not.

01:15:17.707 --> 01:15:19.708
You think it's because
you kissed her?

01:15:19.709 --> 01:15:21.710
Why do you ask so many questions?

01:15:21.711 --> 01:15:23.812
I mean, you talk more than
anybody else in the world.

01:15:23.813 --> 01:15:25.314
You talk more than me.

01:15:25.315 --> 01:15:27.715
Nobody talks more than you.

01:15:27.716 --> 01:15:28.817
You do.

01:15:28.818 --> 01:15:31.852
"Yo this" and "Yo that".

01:15:31.853 --> 01:15:33.522
I don't say "Yo" a lot.

01:15:33.523 --> 01:15:36.057
I don't feel very well.

01:15:36.058 --> 01:15:38.992
Do we have any food left?

01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:46.568
Hey, lock the door behind me.

01:15:46.569 --> 01:15:47.936
I'll be back in a minute.

01:15:47.937 --> 01:15:49.071
But we can't go outside.

01:15:53.575 --> 01:15:54.643
Henry!

01:15:54.644 --> 01:15:55.944
Hello, Mister.

01:15:55.945 --> 01:15:58.345
Have you seen my mom?

01:15:58.747 --> 01:16:01.615
She works this corner sometimes.

01:16:01.616 --> 01:16:03.618
Hey, Mister, I'm doing okay today.

01:16:03.619 --> 01:16:05.853
You can have the spot for
rush hour if you want it.

01:16:05.854 --> 01:16:07.823
No, thanks.

01:16:07.824 --> 01:16:10.559
I need to find her.

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.660
Hey, Mister, Mister, Mister...

01:16:12.661 --> 01:16:14.761
Hold up.

01:16:26.007 --> 01:16:28.777
Third Battalion, fifth Marine.

01:16:28.778 --> 01:16:31.711
Gulf War.
Operation Desert Shield.

01:16:41.690 --> 01:16:44.624
Good luck to you, Mister.

01:16:56.872 --> 01:16:59.005
Hey!

01:16:59.441 --> 01:17:01.675
Hey, man!

01:17:01.676 --> 01:17:02.944
What's up, little man?

01:17:02.945 --> 01:17:04.780
You seen my mom?

01:17:04.781 --> 01:17:07.047
She works for you.

01:17:07.048 --> 01:17:09.084
She work for me?

01:17:09.085 --> 01:17:10.852
She don't work for
me, but go ahead.

01:17:10.853 --> 01:17:12.154
Come on, man.

01:17:12.155 --> 01:17:13.989
You think I'm wired or something?

01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:17.457
I'm not about snitching.

01:17:18.427 --> 01:17:20.862
What's her name?
Gloria.

01:17:20.863 --> 01:17:24.631
Gloria?
What, with all the tattoos?

01:17:24.933 --> 01:17:26.635
I was wondering where
she been myself.

01:17:26.636 --> 01:17:28.601
What are you, her son?

01:17:28.937 --> 01:17:30.970
You haven't seen her?

01:17:32.574 --> 01:17:34.709
Nah.

01:17:34.710 --> 01:17:37.491
But when you find her, tell her
to come see me, all right?

01:17:38.914 --> 01:17:42.717
Yo, you don't even care
enough to look for her?

01:17:42.718 --> 01:17:45.018
She worked for you
for like four years.

01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:47.788
What the fuck you just say to me?

01:17:47.789 --> 01:17:50.123
That's some bullshit, Kris.

01:17:59.601 --> 01:18:01.036
Little Mighty Mouse, motherfucker.

01:18:24.826 --> 01:18:26.926
That was you with Dip Stick?

01:18:27.963 --> 01:18:30.497
And all he gave you was a dollar?

01:18:32.133 --> 01:18:33.201
Gimme that!

01:18:45.747 --> 01:18:47.714
Move!

01:19:11.039 --> 01:19:13.206
Pete!

01:19:13.208 --> 01:19:15.308
Pete, let me in!

01:19:30.825 --> 01:19:33.226
Sarah passed...

01:19:49.978 --> 01:19:52.814
Unit Two, theft reported.

01:19:52.815 --> 01:19:55.582
Bedford playground.
Please respond.

01:20:02.724 --> 01:20:05.327
Shots fired.

01:20:05.328 --> 01:20:06.962
Officer needs assistance.

01:20:06.963 --> 01:20:09.796
Unit Two.
Please respond.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.268
Ten-four. Copy.

01:20:14.269 --> 01:20:17.203
I'm three minutes away.

01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:31.351
It's okay now, Pete.

01:20:32.821 --> 01:20:35.655
Sarah passed away.

01:20:59.748 --> 01:21:01.781
What's it say?

01:21:03.652 --> 01:21:06.853
102, I think.

01:21:07.222 --> 01:21:09.422
Is that bad?

01:21:18.366 --> 01:21:20.700
How do you feel now?

01:21:21.336 --> 01:21:23.936
Better, Mister.

01:22:18.159 --> 01:22:21.427
What day is it?

01:22:23.064 --> 01:22:24.999
Forget it, Pete.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.301
Forget it?

01:22:26.302 --> 01:22:28.335
You need a doctor.

01:22:28.336 --> 01:22:30.403
Let's go.

01:23:05.206 --> 01:23:06.541
Violet Carson?

01:23:06.542 --> 01:23:09.208
Oh, yeah, here.

01:23:42.076 --> 01:23:44.010
What's your name?

01:23:45.847 --> 01:23:47.547
Mister Winfield.

01:23:47.949 --> 01:23:50.449
Ah! What's your first name?

01:23:50.852 --> 01:23:53.586
Mister is my first name.

01:23:53.922 --> 01:23:56.055
Uh, who's your agent?

01:23:58.092 --> 01:24:02.028
Do you have a parent here with you?

01:24:02.564 --> 01:24:04.864
No.

01:24:06.869 --> 01:24:09.202
I have this.

01:24:14.509 --> 01:24:19.513
We can't see you unless you have an
agent or at least parental consent.

01:24:19.514 --> 01:24:21.348
But I'm really good.

01:24:21.349 --> 01:24:23.217
What's that?

01:24:23.218 --> 01:24:25.953
I said I'm good.

01:24:25.954 --> 01:24:28.855
There's nothing we can do.

01:24:36.631 --> 01:24:39.565
I guess you think,

01:24:40.468 --> 01:24:43.870
you know, you're like
an authority figure.

01:24:46.241 --> 01:24:48.941
With that stupid fucking
uniform, huh, buddy?

01:24:49.878 --> 01:24:53.279
King clip-on tie here.
Big fucking man, huh?

01:24:55.917 --> 01:24:58.337
You know, these are the
limits of your life, man.

01:25:00.054 --> 01:25:02.355
Ruler of your little
fuckin' gate here.

01:25:02.991 --> 01:25:05.958
Here. There's your $4,

01:25:05.994 --> 01:25:08.961
you pathetic piece of shit.

01:25:14.669 --> 01:25:17.069
I'm sorry.

01:25:48.403 --> 01:25:51.971
I'm going to lie
down, but I'm okay.

01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:08.120
I'll be back in an hour.

01:26:08.690 --> 01:26:10.625
Wait. I'll come, too.

01:26:10.626 --> 01:26:12.592
No, you gotta stay here.

01:26:12.593 --> 01:26:13.728
What are you going to do?

01:26:17.699 --> 01:26:20.232
Ask for help.

01:26:28.710 --> 01:26:30.511
It's fine, I'll just
take the subway.

01:26:30.512 --> 01:26:32.547
I have my phone with me,
you don't have to worry.

01:26:32.548 --> 01:26:34.747
Oh, great!

01:26:36.417 --> 01:26:38.317
Hi.

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:42.054
Um, who are you looking for?

01:26:42.457 --> 01:26:44.191
A friend.

01:26:44.192 --> 01:26:45.625
Apartment 5.

01:26:45.626 --> 01:26:47.560
Alice?

01:26:48.329 --> 01:26:50.229
You know where she is?

01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:53.566
She moved out.

01:27:11.686 --> 01:27:13.454
Run, Pete.

01:27:13.455 --> 01:27:16.622
Where do you think you're going?

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:20.728
Run.

01:27:20.729 --> 01:27:22.196
He's going in the other direction.

01:27:22.197 --> 01:27:23.631
I'm not going to tell
you one more time.

01:27:23.632 --> 01:27:25.299
Look stop, boy. Goddamn!

01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:27.568
Oh, man!

01:27:28.637 --> 01:27:30.138
Come here.

01:27:30.139 --> 01:27:32.104
Come on, get him to the car.

01:27:33.775 --> 01:27:35.343
Yo, Officer!

01:27:35.344 --> 01:27:37.309
There go one more right here.

01:27:41.482 --> 01:27:43.217
We'll get him later, man.

01:27:43.218 --> 01:27:45.153
Thanks for the tip.
Keep it up.

01:27:45.154 --> 01:27:46.287
All right, man.

01:28:02.703 --> 01:28:04.639
What up, Kris?

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.507
You tell me.

01:28:06.508 --> 01:28:08.543
Yo, you know they been living
by themselves all summer.

01:28:08.544 --> 01:28:10.511
Oh, word?

Authority's around here so much.

01:28:11.814 --> 01:28:13.114
Not you, huh?

01:28:13.115 --> 01:28:15.249
No!
Oh!

01:28:15.250 --> 01:28:16.684
Yo, they were supposed
to be at Riverview

01:28:16.685 --> 01:28:18.119
a long time ago.

01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:20.620
When I put the po-po on to Curtis.

01:28:20.621 --> 01:28:22.688
Fuck.

01:28:24.192 --> 01:28:26.127
Okay.

01:28:26.128 --> 01:28:28.329
- What I mean is...
- Yes?

01:28:28.330 --> 01:28:31.265
The police, they was accusing
me of breaking into apartments.

01:28:31.266 --> 01:28:33.399
- Right.
- And...

01:28:34.335 --> 01:28:36.170
What you saying?

01:28:36.171 --> 01:28:37.438
They said they would drop it
if I gave them something.

01:28:37.439 --> 01:28:40.141
I just told them Curtis
was selling, that's it.

01:28:40.142 --> 01:28:41.209
So you gave them Curtis.

01:28:41.210 --> 01:28:43.277
That's it, man.

01:28:43.278 --> 01:28:44.445
Nothing about you.

01:28:44.446 --> 01:28:47.515
Just Curtis...
Right.

01:28:47.516 --> 01:28:49.217
Because you wouldn't
snitch on me, right?

01:28:49.218 --> 01:28:51.786
Ah, hell, no! I wouldn't
snitch on you. Hell, no, man.

01:28:51.787 --> 01:28:53.454
'Cause you're my man.
Hell, yeah!

01:28:53.455 --> 01:28:54.555
When niggas be talking
about you bad,

01:28:54.556 --> 01:28:55.723
I be the one that's defending you.

01:28:55.724 --> 01:28:57.458
Word up.

01:28:57.459 --> 01:28:59.358
What's your name, man?

01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:02.294
Dartavius Stallsworth.

01:29:02.563 --> 01:29:05.666
Okay, Mr. Stallsworth.

01:29:05.667 --> 01:29:08.769
See those two ugly,
sweaty dudes over there?

01:29:08.770 --> 01:29:12.440
I want you to become
friends with them.

01:29:12.441 --> 01:29:13.808
Okay?

01:29:13.809 --> 01:29:16.275
We all gonna take a ride together.

01:29:16.878 --> 01:29:18.879
Let's take a ride.

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:21.380
Get him.

01:30:31.786 --> 01:30:34.720
You got clout, right?

01:30:35.656 --> 01:30:36.991
What?

01:30:36.992 --> 01:30:39.626
You got a job for me?

01:30:39.627 --> 01:30:41.295
A job for you?

01:30:41.296 --> 01:30:43.397
What you talking about, man?
You strung out?

01:30:43.398 --> 01:30:44.498
Yeah, he looks strung out.

01:30:47.336 --> 01:30:49.502
I don't mess with that stuff, man.

01:30:49.503 --> 01:30:51.704
I just need a job.

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:54.373
You ever find your mom?

01:30:57.778 --> 01:31:00.412
She's dead.

01:31:04.419 --> 01:31:07.253
Look, everybody gotta
die, little man.

01:31:07.421 --> 01:31:09.023
Just give me a job.

01:31:09.024 --> 01:31:11.490
I'll do whatever you want.

01:31:12.827 --> 01:31:14.996
You don't have to pay me.

01:31:14.997 --> 01:31:17.930
What, are you gonna work for free?

01:31:18.566 --> 01:31:21.334
I just want my friend
out of Riverview.

01:31:21.335 --> 01:31:23.571
You can make that happen, right?

01:31:23.572 --> 01:31:26.372
Everybody says you're the shit.
You get things done.

01:31:26.907 --> 01:31:29.342
I'll work for you, Kris.

01:31:29.343 --> 01:31:31.477
Just get my friend out.

01:31:33.881 --> 01:31:36.348
Look...

01:31:36.984 --> 01:31:39.518
Take this, all right?

01:31:39.787 --> 01:31:42.621
You don't work for free.

01:31:47.862 --> 01:31:49.995
I just want my friend back.

01:31:50.665 --> 01:31:52.765
I'll teach you a lesson!

01:31:57.438 --> 01:31:58.806
Kris!

01:31:58.807 --> 01:32:00.608
Kris!

01:32:00.609 --> 01:32:01.676
You need a lesson.

01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:09.121
Come on. Let's go, man.
This ain't our fight. Let's roll.

01:32:09.650 --> 01:32:11.585
Think you can steal from me?

01:32:11.586 --> 01:32:13.454
Think you can wreck my store?

01:32:13.455 --> 01:32:16.422
You! Drop the kid.

01:32:18.092 --> 01:32:20.659
Put down the goddamn kid!

01:32:21.095 --> 01:32:24.029
Son of a bitch!

01:32:24.465 --> 01:32:26.367
That little rat stole from me!

01:32:26.368 --> 01:32:27.935
He wrecked my store.

01:32:31.672 --> 01:32:33.772
Get the fuck out of here. Cuff him.

01:32:44.085 --> 01:32:46.618
Apartment 3E?

01:32:48.989 --> 01:32:52.491
We took your momma away a
couple of months ago. She around?

01:32:59.033 --> 01:33:01.500
Get up.

01:33:42.143 --> 01:33:44.476
All summer, huh?

01:33:48.482 --> 01:33:50.916
Keep your head up, son.

01:34:03.531 --> 01:34:04.932
What are you?

01:34:04.933 --> 01:34:08.066
13? 14 years old?

01:34:15.609 --> 01:34:17.543
Keep fighting.

01:34:18.112 --> 01:34:21.713
There ain't no ceiling
for a kid like you.

01:34:24.952 --> 01:34:27.453
I can't do it alone.

01:34:29.056 --> 01:34:30.989
What's that?

01:34:34.762 --> 01:34:37.596
I can't do it alone.

01:34:49.743 --> 01:34:52.144
None of us can.

01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:18.172
Wait right there.

01:35:18.173 --> 01:35:21.673
Uh, this is Mister Winfield.

01:35:24.712 --> 01:35:26.578
Come on.

01:35:34.755 --> 01:35:37.257
There's things to do. Games.

01:35:37.258 --> 01:35:39.758
Come on.

01:35:41.028 --> 01:35:42.263
Yo, what's your problem?

01:35:42.264 --> 01:35:45.197
Come on, honey. Come on.

01:35:49.770 --> 01:35:51.837
Mister.

01:35:56.944 --> 01:35:59.945
Not while we're here.
Understand?

01:36:03.250 --> 01:36:05.251
So what's up?

01:36:05.252 --> 01:36:07.755
Nothing.

01:36:07.756 --> 01:36:11.023
I'm not sick anymore and the
food here is pretty good.

01:36:13.594 --> 01:36:15.563
Who did that to your eye?

01:36:15.564 --> 01:36:18.230
I don't know their names.

01:36:22.336 --> 01:36:25.270
Show them to me.

01:36:50.898 --> 01:36:52.733
Mister is being released to you

01:36:52.734 --> 01:36:56.301
with the understanding that
you will continue your rehab.

01:37:02.209 --> 01:37:04.210
How was he?

01:37:04.211 --> 01:37:05.980
Not too bad.

01:37:05.981 --> 01:37:09.383
A couple of incidents, but
he was protecting a friend.

01:37:09.384 --> 01:37:12.152
He barely had time to settle in.

01:37:12.153 --> 01:37:15.087
He's been here all summer
and didn't settle in?

01:37:15.656 --> 01:37:17.356
No.

01:37:17.691 --> 01:37:18.792
No?

01:37:18.793 --> 01:37:21.994
He's only been with us two weeks.

01:37:22.062 --> 01:37:24.897
Where was he before that?

01:37:24.898 --> 01:37:27.001
I don't know.

01:37:27.002 --> 01:37:30.969
All I know is Housing Authority
picked him up from home.

01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:36.343
When I was arrested they told me
that he would be brought here.

01:37:36.344 --> 01:37:39.847
I thought he was safe. I thought
he was... I thought he was here.

01:37:39.848 --> 01:37:42.814
Our records show that you were
released over two months ago.

01:37:45.019 --> 01:37:47.955
If you were so concerned
about Mister,

01:37:47.956 --> 01:37:51.089
even if you believed he was here,

01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:55.362
I was making sure the
next time I saw him,

01:37:55.363 --> 01:37:57.429
I could look him in the eye.

01:37:58.932 --> 01:38:01.067
Can you?

01:38:17.451 --> 01:38:19.286
Hey!

01:38:19.287 --> 01:38:21.987
Is that your mom?

01:38:38.038 --> 01:38:39.907
Yeah.

01:38:39.908 --> 01:38:41.841
I'll be back for you.

01:38:41.842 --> 01:38:44.009
Promise?

01:38:53.887 --> 01:38:56.222
I promise.

01:38:56.223 --> 01:38:59.157
You're strong, Pete.

01:39:00.094 --> 01:39:02.862
Don't let anybody punk you.

01:39:02.863 --> 01:39:05.797
Got it?

01:39:05.999 --> 01:39:08.133
I got it.

01:39:10.504 --> 01:39:13.438
I'll see you soon.

01:39:41.335 --> 01:39:43.769
Hi, Mister.

01:39:54.081 --> 01:39:56.548
I'm sorry.

01:40:07.194 --> 01:40:09.394
I'm sorry.

01:41:20.567 --> 01:41:22.369
Okay.

01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:25.172
We are going to jump right into it.

01:41:25.173 --> 01:41:29.476
I want you all to write about
what you did this summer, okay?

01:41:29.477 --> 01:41:32.045
I want you to be as detailed
as you possibly can.

01:41:32.046 --> 01:41:33.947
Make it at least one
page long, okay?

01:41:33.948 --> 01:41:36.016
And I want you to take the
whole period to do it.

01:41:36.017 --> 01:41:37.484
If you took a trip this summer,
I wanna know about it.

01:41:37.485 --> 01:41:40.520
I wanna know where you
went, who you went with.

01:41:40.521 --> 01:41:43.090
Anything you remember.
Think about the last three months.

01:41:43.091 --> 01:41:45.359
As much as you can.

01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:47.427
What did you do, say,
on the 4th of July?

01:41:47.428 --> 01:41:49.496
Okay, did anybody in your
family have a birthday?

01:41:49.497 --> 01:41:51.531
Are there any good books
that you read this summer?
