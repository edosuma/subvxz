00:57.290 --> 00:58.323
- Margaret.

00:59.559 --> 01:02.161
What the hell am i
supposed to do with this?

01:02.163 --> 01:04.462
- Doctor's orders, honey.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.098
No staturated fat.

01:07.967 --> 01:10.669
- Ma'am, that doctor is a hack.

01:12.272 --> 01:14.540
And he's pathetic.

01:14.542 --> 01:17.743
He shouldn't even
have a license.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.112
Stop listening to the doctor.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.114
Jesus.

01:21.781 --> 01:23.682
You give me bread?

01:23.684 --> 01:25.317
First of all it's not toasted,

01:25.319 --> 01:27.953
second of all it's peanut
butter without any jam.

01:27.955 --> 01:30.322
How do you expect me to
swallow this or get it down?

01:30.324 --> 01:33.525
How many goddamn times do
i have to tell you that?

01:33.527 --> 01:37.196
Get your nose out of a
cookbook and learn to make

01:37.198 --> 01:40.232
a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

01:41.167 --> 01:42.468
- Keep talking like that

01:42.470 --> 01:44.470
and you'll be making
your own sandwiches.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.071
- What did you say?

01:46.073 --> 01:47.673
What was that?

02:10.663 --> 02:13.365
- According to the global
health education consortium,

02:13.367 --> 02:16.535
there are numerous social
causes for violence.

02:16.537 --> 02:17.936
Poverty, unemployment,

02:17.938 --> 02:20.539
illicit drug and alcohol
abuse, cultural norms.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.107
But these external influences

02:22.109 --> 02:25.677
don't explain the root
cause of violence.

02:30.283 --> 02:32.751
Texas versus Johnson.

02:32.753 --> 02:35.020
Ed Johnson was charged
with first degree murder

02:35.022 --> 02:36.722
after the deaths of
his ex-girlfriend

02:36.724 --> 02:38.557
and a boy she was seeing.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.826
Because of the
heinousness of the crimes,

02:40.828 --> 02:42.327
and the ages of the victims,

02:42.329 --> 02:45.030
the prosecutors wanted to
push for the death penalty.

02:45.032 --> 02:47.833
But because ed was a few
months shy of turning 18,

02:47.835 --> 02:49.401
the judge balked.

02:50.470 --> 02:53.038
He was released after
serving only five years,

02:53.040 --> 02:55.140
for good behavior.

02:55.142 --> 02:57.476
One week after being paroled,

02:57.478 --> 03:01.180
ed was pulled over for
a routine traffic stop.

03:01.182 --> 03:02.581
And the police found
the severed head

03:02.583 --> 03:05.083
of a nine year old
little girl in his trunk.

03:05.085 --> 03:08.554
Because of this new discovery,
ed was sentenced to death.

03:08.556 --> 03:11.390
Had the state sentenced him
after the first violent act

03:11.392 --> 03:13.358
where two innocent
lives were lost,

03:13.360 --> 03:16.929
that little girl
would've been spared.

03:16.931 --> 03:19.698
The most interesting part,
is according to his records,

03:19.700 --> 03:21.099
there was no history
of mental illness

03:21.101 --> 03:23.168
or neurological diseases.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.736
So was he born violent?

03:24.738 --> 03:26.371
Ask yourself that.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.975
Now, without understanding
where violence originates,

03:29.977 --> 03:32.144
it's impossible to rehabilitate,

03:32.146 --> 03:35.414
let alone prevent
future violent acts.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.984
- Well what if violence is
so ingrained to our society,

03:38.986 --> 03:40.852
our American culture...
- excuse me, sir.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.322
- That outbursts are inevitable?

03:43.324 --> 03:45.290
There's no escaping it.

03:45.292 --> 03:47.059
- I refuse to believe that
we're far from stopping

03:47.061 --> 03:49.861
the epidemic of violence
sweeping through our country.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.063
- Even with a system in place

03:51.065 --> 03:53.966
that just trades
death for death?

03:55.468 --> 03:59.605
- Okay, so are controlled
executions an act of violence?

03:59.607 --> 04:02.941
Or an act of mercy for the
loved ones of the victims?

04:02.943 --> 04:04.876
- Isn't the act of
killing always violent?

04:04.878 --> 04:05.878
- Is it?

04:10.683 --> 04:13.619
I want you guys to think about
that when you pick a case.

04:13.621 --> 04:16.721
Look for the hidden motives,
and clues that were missed.

04:16.724 --> 04:17.956
And had they not been missed,

04:17.958 --> 04:19.791
would the tragedy
have been prevented?

04:19.793 --> 04:21.526
And remember to be objective.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.328
That is the key
to get an accurate

04:23.330 --> 04:26.965
and impartial read on
the situation, okay?

04:27.934 --> 04:29.401
Class dismissed.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.906
And you are?
- Ben woods.

04:36.409 --> 04:38.877
Assistant district attorney.

04:40.146 --> 04:44.049
I'd like for you to
consult on a case for me.

04:45.351 --> 04:49.454
His name is Jack shea, he's
set for execution in 72 hours.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.822
With it being an election year,

04:50.824 --> 04:52.257
the governor's
under extra pressure

04:52.259 --> 04:55.260
to reevaluate the state's
position on capital punishment.

04:55.262 --> 04:57.763
- Well the nuances of the law
aren't exactly my specialty...

04:57.765 --> 05:00.132
- I'm not here for
legal advice, miss...

05:00.134 --> 05:01.633
- Doctor.
- Doctor, pardon.

05:01.635 --> 05:02.868
Now you've watched the news,

05:02.870 --> 05:04.202
national focus was
on the protests,

05:04.204 --> 05:05.804
it's got the governor
backed into a corner.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.506
Now if this execution
goes forward,

05:07.508 --> 05:09.074
our schedule, without
an official review,

05:09.076 --> 05:13.679
the governor won't stand a
chance of serving another term.

05:13.681 --> 05:16.315
I just want you to
talk to him, hm?

05:16.317 --> 05:18.483
Give him your
professional opinion.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.620
Consider it your civic duty.

05:21.622 --> 05:24.923
Maybe, just maybe,
you'll save a life.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.227
My card and my
number's in there.

05:37.370 --> 05:40.372
- Hey, quick
monkeying around, garimba.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.941
- Well maybe if
you stopped lion around, Leo.

05:42.943 --> 05:46.912
Get up, lazy bones, it's
time for adventuring.

05:50.550 --> 05:52.117
- Mommy!

05:52.119 --> 05:53.785
- Hi, baby girl.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.721
Shouldn't you be in bed?

05:55.723 --> 05:59.591
- Grandma said I could watch
one more show on TV before bed.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.593
- She did now, huh?

06:01.595 --> 06:03.528
- Yep, all the
animals on this show

06:03.530 --> 06:05.297
live together at the zoo.

06:05.299 --> 06:06.299
- Aw.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.835
- Can we go to the zoo, mommy?

06:12.305 --> 06:13.972
- Well I tell you what.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.208
How about you go upstairs,
brush your teeth,

06:16.210 --> 06:18.210
and you be a good girl
for grandma all week,

06:18.212 --> 06:21.413
and then I will take
you next weekend, okay?

06:21.415 --> 06:23.648
Go on up, brush your teeth
and I'll tuck you in.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.751
- Can grandma read
me a story first?

06:25.753 --> 06:27.719
Please, please please?

06:28.721 --> 06:31.223
- I think I can manage that.

06:31.225 --> 06:34.359
- Come on, grandma, let's go.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.531
- Thanks, mom.
- No problem.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.470
Oh, I left you some
dinner by the stove.

06:45.472 --> 06:47.239
- Thank you.

06:47.241 --> 06:50.509
- Good night, mommy, I love you.

06:50.511 --> 06:53.478
- Good night, I love you.

07:43.931 --> 07:47.232
- I thought you quit
three months ago.

07:48.367 --> 07:51.303
Ally was bummed that
you didn't make dinner.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.537
- I know she was.

07:52.539 --> 07:55.106
You know, I just
couldn't get here.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.509
But thank you for picking
her up from school today.

07:57.511 --> 07:59.144
- It's no problem.

08:00.046 --> 08:01.947
Come here.
- Thank you.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.987
- Don't stay up too late, kiddo.

08:08.989 --> 08:09.989
- I won't.

08:11.257 --> 08:12.457
Good night, mom.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.693
- Good night, sweetheart.

09:04.477 --> 09:05.777
- Ben woods.

09:05.779 --> 09:08.346
- Hey Ben, it's Dr. Tyler.
- Dr. Tyler.

09:08.348 --> 09:09.348
- I'm in.

09:10.583 --> 09:11.616
I'll do it.

09:13.085 --> 09:15.620
I have a few conditions.

09:15.622 --> 09:17.822
Our session needs to be private,

09:17.824 --> 09:20.859
so I don't wanna be in a
standard interview room.

09:20.861 --> 09:23.828
We should be somewhere
where he feels comfortable,

09:23.830 --> 09:26.231
where he can at
least move around.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.732
I mean we're not
gonna get anywhere

09:27.734 --> 09:30.035
if I can't earn his trust.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.062
- Ma'am.
- Thank you.

11:22.214 --> 11:23.348
- Tick tock.

11:25.751 --> 11:26.818
Tick, tock.

11:30.122 --> 11:32.323
You need a hand with that, doc?

11:32.325 --> 11:36.628
- I prefer to be addressed
as Dr. Tyler or Amanda.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.395
Have a seat, please.

12:10.397 --> 12:13.131
State your name for the record.

12:19.672 --> 12:21.740
- Jackson Michael shea.

12:23.309 --> 12:24.676
- Inmate 78011.

12:26.512 --> 12:29.114
- There's a point to
all this, right doc?

12:29.116 --> 12:31.883
Seeing as how the
sand of my hourglass

12:31.885 --> 12:34.519
has just about run out.

12:34.521 --> 12:38.623
I don't see this
benefiting me very much.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.658
- My plan is to get
to the root cause

12:40.660 --> 12:42.327
of your excessive violence.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.995
- You mean the newspaper
and magazine stories

12:43.997 --> 12:45.764
calling me a monster.

12:45.766 --> 12:47.799
- I've read your file.
- And what?

12:47.801 --> 12:49.567
You've read some papers.

12:49.569 --> 12:52.904
Some file a prison hack too
stupid to make it on the outside

12:52.906 --> 12:57.041
wrote about me after he
showed me some inkblots.

13:02.081 --> 13:06.384
You read that shit and
think you're inside my head?

13:11.290 --> 13:14.259
Doc, you don't know a
fucking thing about me.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.627
- You're right, Jack.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.529
I don't know a fucking
thing about you.

13:17.531 --> 13:21.833
And if I did, I wouldn't be
here wasting my time, or yours.

13:23.002 --> 13:25.503
Would you like me to leave?

13:25.505 --> 13:28.807
- Tick, tock.

13:31.677 --> 13:33.745
Tick, tock, tick, tick.

13:35.080 --> 13:39.918
So what's a pretty little
thing like you doing here?

13:39.920 --> 13:42.654
You draw the short straw?

13:42.656 --> 13:44.289
- It's about the violence, Jack.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.691
If I can pinpoint the
time, the place, the cause,

13:46.693 --> 13:51.162
then maybe I can at least
help stop the cycle.

13:51.164 --> 13:55.466
Now we have some very important
decisions to make, don't we?

14:05.377 --> 14:09.113
Let's start...
- with my mother's tit milk.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.648
Did I get enough as an infant

14:10.650 --> 14:14.719
to properly nourish me for
life in civilized society?

14:14.721 --> 14:15.721
- Did you?

14:17.623 --> 14:18.623
- Tick.

14:30.536 --> 14:33.238
Doc, you ready to hear a story?

14:36.008 --> 14:37.075
Tick, tock.

14:38.344 --> 14:39.377
Tick, tock.

14:40.279 --> 14:41.312
Tick, tock.

14:46.419 --> 14:49.053
It was the summer of '85.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.989
We had no money, so we had to

14:50.991 --> 14:54.292
move into my uncle
Mike's single wide.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.629
Sometimes, when I close my eyes,

14:57.631 --> 15:00.665
I can still smell
that musty trailer.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.166
- Bigger bears try to pretend

15:02.168 --> 15:06.437
that they came 'round the
corner to look for a friend.

15:10.910 --> 15:15.146
That they came 'round the
corner to look for a frown.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.648
- Hold on.

15:16.650 --> 15:20.451
- And they try to
pretend that nobody cares.

15:20.453 --> 15:24.956
Whether you walk on the
lines, or on the squares.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.158
- Phone for you, Cynthia.

15:28.694 --> 15:30.595
- Thanks, Mike.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.330
Okay, well, your uncle Mike's

15:32.332 --> 15:35.867
gonna help you finish
reading, okay book?

15:41.674 --> 15:43.474
- Good night, mommy.

15:53.152 --> 15:54.285
- Hey buddy.

15:55.521 --> 15:57.488
- Hey, hey uncle Mike.

15:59.491 --> 16:02.894
- Ready for your
birthday bedtime story?

16:25.851 --> 16:28.987
- People always talk about god.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.521
Where was god when my uncle

16:30.523 --> 16:33.124
was sneaking into my
bedroom late at night,

16:33.126 --> 16:35.693
telling me bedroom stories,

16:35.695 --> 16:37.495
I didn't wanna hear.

16:50.409 --> 16:52.677
- Everything is gonna
be okay, my son.

16:52.679 --> 16:56.080
You are in the presence
of the lord now.

16:56.082 --> 16:58.049
Tell me what happened.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.569
- How did your
mother react to the news?

17:18.570 --> 17:20.972
- Not the way you'd think.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.507
- Mrs. shea, I'm,

17:23.776 --> 17:26.044
I really wish I were here
under different circumstances,

17:26.046 --> 17:27.046
I'm sorry.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.783
It involves your
brother and your son.

17:33.085 --> 17:35.086
- Well what is it?

17:35.088 --> 17:39.090
- Has, has your son been
acting different lately?

17:39.092 --> 17:42.060
Anything strange
about his behavior?

17:42.062 --> 17:44.796
- My, my, my son is a good boy.

17:47.499 --> 17:48.633
- Yes he is.

17:50.369 --> 17:54.105
I don't know how to say
this, so I'll just say it.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.473
We believe that your brother

17:55.475 --> 17:59.177
has been inappropriately
touching your son.

18:00.212 --> 18:03.047
- Inappropriately
touching my son?

18:05.884 --> 18:09.787
- Your brother's been
molesting your son, Mrs. shea.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.489
- That is not true.

18:13.225 --> 18:14.358
- I'm sorry.

18:15.661 --> 18:17.728
- That is not true.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.797
I don't know where
you got that, but,

18:19.799 --> 18:21.265
that ain't true.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.802
- Mrs. shea, your son told me.

18:27.239 --> 18:28.239
I'm sorry.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.748
- That don't make no sense.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.384
That don't make no sense.

18:40.386 --> 18:42.453
That's a, that's a lie.

18:43.322 --> 18:45.289
That is a goddamn lie.

18:47.025 --> 18:48.926
You're making up stories.

18:48.928 --> 18:52.463
And you come in here with
your lies and your stories.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.031
You need to go.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.800
You need to get the
hell outta here.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.935
You need to get the
hell outta my house.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.538
I said get the hell
outta my house.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.472
Get out, get outta here.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.608
And your lies, and your stories.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.009
I don't know what
you're talking about.

19:05.011 --> 19:07.712
What the hell did
you do to my boy?

19:07.714 --> 19:09.480
- I was the victim.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.282
But I may as well have
been the perpetrator

19:11.284 --> 19:13.484
from the way she reacted.

19:18.390 --> 19:20.291
- I said to get outta my house.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.125
- I'm sorry.

19:21.127 --> 19:22.293
May god be with you.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.395
- This is my house!

19:24.397 --> 19:25.963
It's my house!

19:25.965 --> 19:30.434
Come in here, saying
things like that to me.

19:49.388 --> 19:51.522
- Cynthia shea
drank herself to death

19:51.524 --> 19:53.157
pretty soon after.

19:54.826 --> 19:56.127
Killed, maybe.

20:00.966 --> 20:02.600
What do you think?

20:03.869 --> 20:07.572
Destined from a tender
age to be a criminal, or.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.173
- Well it's too
soon in the process

20:09.175 --> 20:10.841
for me to form an
opinion on that.

20:10.843 --> 20:13.177
- What exactly is your process?

20:13.179 --> 20:15.746
- I know that you're familiar
with the flag system.

20:15.748 --> 20:18.015
So I am looking for
signs that stand out.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.084
And recognizing the
red flags early enough

20:20.086 --> 20:23.221
so that the violence
can be stopped.

20:25.457 --> 20:28.259
So, let's talk about your uncle.

20:34.366 --> 20:38.703
- I lived with him
until about the time I was 17.

20:49.681 --> 20:52.683
After I got too old, uncle
Mike turned his attentions

20:52.685 --> 20:56.020
to the kid of the
girl he'd been seeing.

20:56.022 --> 20:58.823
She didn't suspect a damn thing.

21:00.759 --> 21:04.095
Seeing him chase
after that little boy,

21:04.930 --> 21:06.998
something just snapped.

21:30.322 --> 21:32.790
- No no, please, god.

21:41.833 --> 21:44.468
- I felt illuminated and free.

21:45.904 --> 21:47.538
- Free?

21:47.540 --> 21:49.073
- Well it was the
first time in my life

21:49.075 --> 21:52.810
I was ever in control of
the events that guided me.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.713
Nothing's more
freeing than that.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.282
- You know you
could've stopped him

21:58.284 --> 22:01.485
without putting him
in the hospital.

22:01.487 --> 22:04.055
You chose to fly into a rage.

22:05.290 --> 22:07.425
- Don't you get it, doc?

22:08.694 --> 22:11.262
We're all just caged animals.

22:13.765 --> 22:15.733
With animal instincts.

22:22.141 --> 22:25.609
Time's up, Dr. Tyler.

22:51.103 --> 22:52.870
- Firefighters
from waco and other cities

22:52.872 --> 22:55.539
report that due to dry
weather and wind conditions,

22:55.541 --> 22:57.842
the fire is still very
much an active threat

22:57.844 --> 22:59.343
to local communities,

22:59.345 --> 23:01.979
and that evacuation orders
will remain in place.

23:01.981 --> 23:05.850
The fire is currently
reported to be 15% contained.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.618
More information on
this ongoing story

23:07.620 --> 23:10.421
will be reported as
it becomes available.

23:10.423 --> 23:12.022
- God, I miss you.

23:12.024 --> 23:13.557
Looking at law and order,

23:13.559 --> 23:15.826
the impending execution of
Texas inmate Jackson shea

23:15.828 --> 23:18.262
shines a harsh light
on capital punishment

23:18.264 --> 23:19.864
in the lone star state.

23:19.866 --> 23:22.767
Due to vocal public opinion
on both sides of the issue,

23:22.769 --> 23:25.703
the governor has announced a
final review of the possibility

23:25.705 --> 23:28.339
for a stay of execution
in Mr. shea's case

23:28.341 --> 23:30.775
under the authority
of Dr. Amanda Tyler,

23:30.777 --> 23:32.610
a noted criminal psychologist.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.779
The governor has stated
that Dr. Tyler's findings

23:34.781 --> 23:37.715
will likely be a key factor
in determining what action

23:37.717 --> 23:41.685
the Texas department of
criminal justice will take.

23:43.856 --> 23:46.257
- You ready to start, Jack?

23:47.726 --> 23:49.927
- The judge gave me a choice.

23:49.929 --> 23:53.697
Either go to military
school, or go to juvie.

23:53.699 --> 23:55.699
I breeze through basic training,

23:55.701 --> 23:58.803
get selected for sniper school
because I have 20/10 vision,

23:58.805 --> 24:00.938
and I aced marksmanship.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.174
- Well your file says
that you actually

24:03.176 --> 24:05.009
got kicked out of
military school.

24:05.011 --> 24:08.412
That resulted in
parole left 18 months.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.883
There's consequences
for our actions, Jack.

24:16.922 --> 24:17.922
Action.

24:19.324 --> 24:20.324
Reaction.

24:21.393 --> 24:24.195
Action, you put your
uncle in the hospital.

24:24.197 --> 24:26.597
Reaction, you get
sentenced to 18 months.

24:26.599 --> 24:28.532
- 18 months, served 12.

24:28.534 --> 24:30.334
- So this is, what?

24:30.336 --> 24:33.037
An example of the
system failing?

24:33.039 --> 24:34.505
You think you're above the law?

24:34.507 --> 24:37.308
- You ever cheat the
insurance companies, doc?

24:37.310 --> 24:40.945
Bill a patient for cash
and put in a claim for it.

24:40.947 --> 24:44.882
Us in the know call that
double back billing.

24:44.884 --> 24:45.983
First line of defense

24:45.985 --> 24:47.518
against the y2k buzz,

24:47.520 --> 24:49.253
checking each
machine to make sure

24:49.255 --> 24:52.323
it works properly
in the year 2000.

24:52.325 --> 24:54.625
- Mia, could you give us two
fingers of the good stuff?

24:54.627 --> 24:55.626
- Yes, Marty.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.194
- I met Marty in prison.

24:57.196 --> 25:00.698
Let's just say he was
someone in the know.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.300
Once I got out, he
offered me a job,

25:03.302 --> 25:07.738
'cause let's face it, who
else is gonna hire a con?

25:07.740 --> 25:09.540
- Listen to me, kid.

25:10.742 --> 25:14.845
I'm talking about doctors,
lawyers, dentists.

25:14.847 --> 25:19.383
Large amounts of cash that
don't get reported to the IRS.

25:19.385 --> 25:22.686
Won't be reported to the
cops if it comes up missing.

25:22.688 --> 25:26.123
They hide their money in a
coat closet in their office,

25:26.125 --> 25:27.758
or in a shoe box under the bed.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.126
There was this one lawyer,

25:29.128 --> 25:31.762
he hid 25,000 fucking
dollars in a coffee can

25:31.764 --> 25:34.498
that he stuck in a microwave.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.634
- There's a point
somewhere here, right?

25:36.636 --> 25:37.902
- Yeah, this is the point.

25:37.904 --> 25:39.803
That dickhead parole
officer I have?

25:39.805 --> 25:43.941
He got me a night job
cleaning office buildings.

25:44.943 --> 25:46.544
Hey.

25:46.546 --> 25:47.811
This guy, he's gotta replace

25:47.813 --> 25:49.480
the shop-vac on
the second floor.

25:49.482 --> 25:50.514
- The hell I care for?

25:50.516 --> 25:52.716
Just sign the damn board.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.936
- Now in one of these
buildings is a gynecologist,

26:11.938 --> 26:14.371
who gives a discount
to women who pay cash,

26:14.373 --> 26:17.908
and then he bills their
insurance company.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.557
There it is.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.667
He's got a safe in his closet

26:43.669 --> 26:46.303
that is bursting out
the fucking seams.

26:46.305 --> 26:47.905
- How much money are
we talking about?

26:47.907 --> 26:50.274
- We won't know 'til we open it.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.409
This doctor must be
some kinda idiot.

26:52.411 --> 26:53.677
He buys himself a wall safe,

26:53.679 --> 26:55.713
but he doesn't put it in a wall.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.181
You got the hammer, kid?

26:57.183 --> 27:01.085
What're you doing, get the
chisel, come on, man, come on.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.121
Come on.

27:05.390 --> 27:08.325
Now just go down the sides,
it's soft there, come on.

27:15.066 --> 27:16.600
Yes.

27:16.602 --> 27:18.435
We won't know until we open
it, but I can tell you this.

27:18.437 --> 27:20.804
If someone finds it necessary

27:20.806 --> 27:23.440
to hide an unwired
safe in their office,

27:23.442 --> 27:27.578
generally speaking, it's
for a very good reason.

27:30.615 --> 27:31.615
Damn.

27:32.751 --> 27:35.719
Just like milking a tit, kid.

27:35.721 --> 27:37.221
Come on, pack it up,
get the fuck outta here

27:37.223 --> 27:40.924
and meet me back at my
place for breakfast.

27:50.802 --> 27:52.269
You listen to me.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.471
You do what I say,
and both of us

27:54.473 --> 27:56.940
could make our Mike bend it.

28:01.213 --> 28:02.213
- Hey.

28:03.214 --> 28:05.916
You forgot to sign out.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.317
- Sorry.

28:19.097 --> 28:21.832
I grew up poor, but there I was,

28:21.834 --> 28:26.136
staring at more money than
my mama made in a year.

28:30.775 --> 28:31.775
- $16,400.

28:36.281 --> 28:39.083
Go ahead, take your half.

28:39.085 --> 28:40.718
- Half?

28:40.720 --> 28:42.753
- Yeah, we're partners.

28:42.755 --> 28:47.357
Take half, that's what partners
do, right down the middle.

28:47.359 --> 28:50.761
Come on, take it,
take it, take it.

28:50.763 --> 28:53.664
So long as you follow
the rules, we're golden.

28:53.666 --> 28:55.132
Number one rule.

28:56.901 --> 28:58.702
You gotta stay innocuous.

28:58.704 --> 29:00.537
Don't let them see you coming.

29:00.539 --> 29:03.340
You know the cops in robbery,

29:03.342 --> 29:04.374
they're looking for the asshole

29:04.376 --> 29:05.843
who's walking down the street

29:05.845 --> 29:08.746
with a shiny new rolex
the day after a big heist.

29:08.748 --> 29:11.381
And once you're
pegged, you're pegged.

29:11.383 --> 29:12.883
I mean, kid you
could buy yourself

29:12.885 --> 29:14.952
a new pair of shoes
once in a while,

29:14.954 --> 29:18.322
but you go walking down
Broadway in a silk Italian suit?

29:18.324 --> 29:22.559
You'll be in a line-up
for the rest of your life.

29:22.561 --> 29:25.295
We on the same train here, kid?

29:26.097 --> 29:27.731
- Yeah.

29:27.733 --> 29:30.868
I'd say that train
left the station.

29:35.406 --> 29:37.174
- You gotta stop
drinking coffee.

29:37.176 --> 29:38.375
Open that up.

29:40.011 --> 29:41.578
It's gonna put a
hole in your stomach.

29:41.580 --> 29:42.980
It's the worst thing
for you, coffee.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.882
It's bad for your nerves.

29:44.884 --> 29:46.416
This'll make it a little better,

29:46.418 --> 29:48.752
but you really should stop that.

29:48.754 --> 29:50.687
I'm your friend, you
know what I mean?

29:50.689 --> 29:52.556
You got a big future.

29:53.758 --> 29:55.225
Here's to crime.

29:56.427 --> 30:00.731
Who says crime doesn't pay?

30:02.901 --> 30:04.301
Salud.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.070
- I was a student,
Marty the teacher.

30:07.072 --> 30:08.572
After our third job together,

30:08.574 --> 30:10.874
Marty put me to the test.

30:10.876 --> 30:12.776
Find a mark of my own.

30:12.778 --> 30:15.112
So I checked out a
few local dentists.

30:15.114 --> 30:16.647
Hey doc, I don't have
an insurance card,

30:16.649 --> 30:18.415
do you give discounts for cash?

30:18.417 --> 30:19.650
- 'Fraid not.

30:20.385 --> 30:22.619
Insurance and cards only.

30:24.155 --> 30:28.659
Open wide, seems like
you've got a bad cavity.

30:28.661 --> 30:30.060
- By the third dentist,

30:30.062 --> 30:33.163
my gums were so swollen
that my teeth felt like

30:33.165 --> 30:35.399
they were ready to fall out.

30:35.401 --> 30:38.168
But, I had the cleanest
mouth in the city.

30:38.170 --> 30:41.305
- I can't believe
you'd be so stupid.

30:41.307 --> 30:45.676
How many times can you get
your teeth cleaned in one day?

30:45.678 --> 30:46.810
Here we are.

30:48.613 --> 30:49.613
Dentists.

30:57.522 --> 30:58.922
- Good afternoon,

30:58.924 --> 31:00.424
thank you for calling
sunshine dental.

31:00.426 --> 31:04.061
- Hello, do you offer
senior and cash discounts?

31:04.063 --> 31:05.195
Oh, yes sir, we do.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.230
- Oh, you do.

31:06.232 --> 31:07.798
You do offer discounts for cash.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.032
Too right, we do.

31:09.034 --> 31:10.300
- Well that's fantastic.

31:10.302 --> 31:11.735
Thank you very much.

31:11.737 --> 31:13.097
- Well
would you care to make an...

31:15.608 --> 31:18.909
- what's the moral
of your story, kid?

31:20.144 --> 31:24.147
Let your fingers do the walking
through the yellow pages.

31:25.583 --> 31:28.085
- What's this?

31:28.087 --> 31:30.721
- That is a Christmas present.

31:33.524 --> 31:35.826
- So it's one of those,

31:35.828 --> 31:38.795
too good to be
true type of deals.

31:39.831 --> 31:40.664
- We don't know what's
in the fucking safe

31:40.666 --> 31:41.765
until we open it, right?

31:41.767 --> 31:42.699
Come on.

31:42.701 --> 31:44.268
I can't sit here.

31:44.270 --> 31:46.737
I hate that couch, you know
i found a rat in there once.

31:46.739 --> 31:48.872
- Why didn't you tell me
that before I sat on it?

31:48.874 --> 31:53.176
- Before you slept on it.

31:58.616 --> 32:01.618
- Leo frank, attorney at law.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.287
The tip game from an
old friend of Martin's

32:03.289 --> 32:07.057
who was still doing time and
needed a stake when he got out.

32:07.059 --> 32:10.761
Martin agreed to put
away 20% for him.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.404
- Right on time.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.575
Alright, we gain access
through the maintenance door

32:25.577 --> 32:27.411
on the side of the building.

32:27.413 --> 32:28.413
Let's go.

32:41.893 --> 32:44.594
- Where's the safe?
- There it is, behind the bar.

32:44.596 --> 32:46.229
Just like he said.

32:57.675 --> 32:59.309
- Now why would you go
through all the trouble

32:59.311 --> 33:01.778
with a safe like that if
you're not gonna wire it?

33:03.148 --> 33:07.084
- You don't hardwire
something that doesn't exist.

33:07.086 --> 33:09.820
- You sure about this, old man?

33:11.723 --> 33:13.023
- Shit.
- What?

33:14.625 --> 33:16.927
- Battery's dead.
- Are you kidding me?

33:16.929 --> 33:18.562
- Do you have any extras?

33:18.564 --> 33:20.998
- There's one in the
flashlights, will those work?

33:21.000 --> 33:22.899
- No, this takes AAA.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.783
- Think I found something.

33:39.785 --> 33:41.251
- Get out of here with
that, it's disgusting.

33:41.253 --> 33:42.486
- Hold on.

33:42.488 --> 33:43.820
- You don't know
where that's been.

33:43.822 --> 33:45.856
Have you no decency?

33:45.858 --> 33:48.091
Just watch the door.

33:48.093 --> 33:49.593
- Wrap it up, Marty.

33:49.595 --> 33:51.561
- Okay, okay, alright.

34:02.073 --> 34:03.073
Yes.

34:06.477 --> 34:07.978
- Did you know that
motion for discovery

34:07.980 --> 34:09.579
means the prosecutor
and the defendant

34:09.581 --> 34:11.581
must exchange all
evidence and information

34:11.583 --> 34:13.382
pertinent to a case?

34:25.596 --> 34:29.299
- $660,000, divided
by two, minus 20%,

34:30.234 --> 34:33.003
is a great night's work, man.

34:33.005 --> 34:34.005
Fuck.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.040
What?

34:37.942 --> 34:38.942
What?

34:48.186 --> 34:50.120
- I don't know,
Marty, it's just.

34:50.121 --> 34:54.024
I know when something
is too good to be true.

34:55.359 --> 34:57.494
- What's your point?

34:57.496 --> 35:00.530
- My point is that there's not
that many safes lying around

35:00.532 --> 35:01.865
with this kinda cash in it

35:01.867 --> 35:03.467
that aren't for
something special.

35:03.469 --> 35:04.868
- What's the matter with you?

35:04.870 --> 35:06.269
Are you mental? Come on.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.671
- I'm serious.

35:07.673 --> 35:09.406
Marty, I will take the
money back for you,

35:09.408 --> 35:11.074
tonight, if you want.

35:11.076 --> 35:14.177
- Kid, what're
you talking about?

35:14.179 --> 35:15.846
We can't put it back.

35:15.848 --> 35:18.415
- We take the money, and buy a
condo on the beach somewhere,

35:18.417 --> 35:20.417
play shuffleboard
with the old ladies.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.119
Just, get outta town.

35:22.121 --> 35:24.354
- Okay, okay, I'll
make you a deal.

35:24.356 --> 35:27.924
Give me one week to
tie up some loose ends.

35:27.926 --> 35:29.559
And then I've got
this friend in Texas,

35:29.561 --> 35:31.561
I was gonna
introduce you to him.

35:31.563 --> 35:34.698
But we'll take the
money, we'll leave town.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.099
One week.

35:36.101 --> 35:37.501
It's all I ask.

35:38.903 --> 35:39.903
Okay?

36:01.292 --> 36:02.526
- Robert?

36:02.528 --> 36:04.995
Mr. belmont?
- Yeah.

36:04.997 --> 36:09.666
- This is captain William
Wilder, robbery division.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.668
- The point is this, Micky?

36:11.670 --> 36:15.172
I got plenty of cops on payroll,
i don't need another one.

36:15.174 --> 36:19.476
- The captain's got a
business proposal for you.

36:23.314 --> 36:25.115
- Look, Mr. belmont.

36:26.317 --> 36:29.486
My wife wants an
entirely new kitchen.

36:29.488 --> 36:32.656
My sons want an entertainment
room in the basement.

36:32.658 --> 36:34.791
And I want my own bathroom
so I don't have to look

36:34.793 --> 36:37.761
at my wife's shit
hanging on the shower.

36:37.763 --> 36:41.731
- Do I look like an
interior decorator to you?

36:43.935 --> 36:45.368
- No.

36:45.370 --> 36:46.903
- Then why do I give a
fuck about your wife's shit

36:46.905 --> 36:49.039
handing in the bathroom?

36:50.041 --> 36:51.908
- Information.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.710
- Bob, hear him out.

37:01.953 --> 37:05.622
- You gonna pay for these
things I want, Mr. belmont.

37:05.624 --> 37:07.357
Plus a little bonus in exchange

37:07.359 --> 37:10.227
for the man who
robbed your safe.

37:14.332 --> 37:18.168
- You oughtta be very
careful, Mr. police captain,

37:18.170 --> 37:22.205
or you might find yourself
missing in your own precinct.

37:22.207 --> 37:23.740
- Robert.
- Yeah.

37:28.379 --> 37:31.548
- The man is an
old school thief.

37:31.550 --> 37:34.517
The kind that has
steel for balls.

37:35.686 --> 37:37.220
Second story guy.

37:38.723 --> 37:40.523
Leo comes to me after
your safe was robbed

37:40.525 --> 37:44.494
and I do a little
quiet poking around.

37:44.496 --> 37:46.096
My contacts tell
me that he's living

37:46.098 --> 37:49.232
in a basement of a
department store.

37:52.970 --> 37:55.839
You wanna know the address?

38:20.064 --> 38:23.633
- What kinda kitchen
does your wife like?

39:02.406 --> 39:04.741
- Where's my money, tough guy?

39:04.743 --> 39:06.009
- I don't know.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.877
I swear I don't know.

39:20.892 --> 39:21.892
Jesus.

39:26.063 --> 39:27.764
- Search the place.

39:54.191 --> 39:56.426
You're a stubborn
son of a bitch.

41:13.370 --> 41:16.105
- The catalyst that
launched you into hell.

41:16.107 --> 41:18.241
- Hell might be a bit extreme.

41:18.243 --> 41:21.344
- Well what would you call it?

41:21.346 --> 41:23.646
Purgatory?
- Anticipation.

41:24.615 --> 41:26.583
You know, that intense
feeling you get

41:26.585 --> 41:27.984
right before you
jump into something

41:27.986 --> 41:31.621
that you know will
change your life forever.

41:31.623 --> 41:35.492
I guess purgatory's as
good a word as anyway.

41:45.202 --> 41:47.904
Put your hands on
the steering wheel.

41:47.906 --> 41:51.374
Handcuff yourself to
the steering wheel.

41:54.245 --> 41:55.445
Pull forward.

41:57.948 --> 42:01.751
You're gonna tell me who
murdered Martin bigg.

42:01.753 --> 42:03.253
I need a name.

42:03.255 --> 42:04.621
- I can't.

42:04.623 --> 42:06.856
- I need a name.
- I can't, he'll kill me.

42:06.858 --> 42:08.024
- What about me?

42:08.026 --> 42:10.093
I will kill you right
here, right now,

42:10.095 --> 42:12.762
unless you give
me a fucking name.

42:12.764 --> 42:14.330
- Robert belmont.

42:15.799 --> 42:16.799
Let go.

42:18.936 --> 42:20.236
He's the key.

42:27.779 --> 42:29.345
- Robert belmont.

42:30.681 --> 42:33.483
Big time loan shark
and business man.

42:33.485 --> 42:35.985
He wasn't hard to track down.

42:35.987 --> 42:38.755
I started moonlighting
as a chauffeur,

42:38.757 --> 42:41.257
driving the son of a bitch.

42:41.259 --> 42:42.792
Learned his routine.

42:42.794 --> 42:46.462
I even picked him up from
his mistress's place.

42:46.464 --> 42:49.532
I always had a drink
waiting for him.

42:49.534 --> 42:53.836
And then one night, I slipped
in a little something extra.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.380
There he is.

43:04.382 --> 43:06.382
Morning, sunshine.

43:06.384 --> 43:09.252
I was worried I put a little
too much in your drink.

43:09.254 --> 43:11.888
- Untie me, you piss ant fuck.

43:12.690 --> 43:15.224
- There's no need to be rude.

43:17.661 --> 43:19.128
- Okay, alright.

43:21.031 --> 43:22.999
You proved your point.

43:28.672 --> 43:32.041
Now untie me and tell
me what you want.

43:40.017 --> 43:41.017
Wow.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.321
You got balls, kid.

43:46.290 --> 43:48.691
I'll give that to you.

43:48.693 --> 43:50.460
You know, you may just be

43:50.462 --> 43:53.496
the guy that I've
been looking for.

43:55.899 --> 43:58.968
The guy that's gonna take my
business to the next level.

44:00.939 --> 44:02.372
I fail to see what's so funny.

44:02.374 --> 44:04.374
- You're alone, tied to a chair.

44:04.376 --> 44:06.476
What about this situation
leads you to believe

44:06.478 --> 44:10.346
you're in a position
suitable for bargaining?

44:12.182 --> 44:13.182
- Okay.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.788
Untie me, and walk away.

44:21.258 --> 44:24.727
We'll just let this one go.

44:28.565 --> 44:32.368
- You're not paying
attention, Bobby.

44:32.370 --> 44:35.405
The only reason
you're still alive,

44:36.607 --> 44:39.075
is I haven't killed you yet.

44:41.712 --> 44:42.745
- How much?

44:53.157 --> 44:55.224
- I will give you this.

44:56.160 --> 44:57.593
You have fine taste in whiskey.

44:57.595 --> 44:59.362
- How much?

45:01.199 --> 45:03.032
- Stay with me, Bobby, boy.

45:03.034 --> 45:04.267
Stay with me.

45:09.540 --> 45:10.840
- One million.

45:15.345 --> 45:17.814
- You remember this, don't you?

45:17.816 --> 45:19.248
You arrogant fuck.

45:19.250 --> 45:21.718
This belonged to my partner.

45:23.420 --> 45:26.889
He didn't know the
money was yours.

45:26.891 --> 45:30.026
You could've, let that one go.

45:30.028 --> 45:32.895
- Your partner was a
degenerate fuck, alright?

45:32.897 --> 45:34.430
He stole from me.

45:34.432 --> 45:37.834
What am I supposed to do,
just pat him on the back?

45:37.836 --> 45:38.836
Fuck that.

45:41.538 --> 45:43.239
Okay, alright, I'm sorry.

45:43.241 --> 45:44.373
Two million.

45:45.109 --> 45:47.343
- You talk too much, Bob.

45:49.314 --> 45:51.914
I'm not interested
in your money.

45:56.755 --> 45:58.788
You tortured my friend.

46:02.359 --> 46:06.662
You tortured him, and let him
bleed to death like a pig.

46:13.270 --> 46:14.904
This is for Marty.

46:27.851 --> 46:29.385
I gave that bastard a preview

46:29.387 --> 46:32.922
of what's waiting
for him in hell.

46:32.924 --> 46:35.124
Belmont got what he deserved,

46:35.126 --> 46:38.761
but I wanna make one thing
real clear to you, doc.

46:38.763 --> 46:40.730
I didn't commit murder.

46:40.732 --> 46:42.932
I performed an execution.

46:43.867 --> 46:46.035
There's a difference.
- Bullshit.

46:46.037 --> 46:49.205
I don't believe that,
and neither do you.

46:49.207 --> 46:52.041
- You talk a lot, but what
can you really speak for?

46:52.043 --> 46:53.776
Can you speak for me?

46:53.778 --> 46:56.212
- I wanna ask you a question.
- Tick, tock.

46:56.214 --> 47:00.349
When it's my time, will
you care about me then?

47:00.351 --> 47:02.985
That moment when the
needle, the very first one,

47:02.987 --> 47:06.055
slips into my body
and relaxes my nerves.

47:06.057 --> 47:08.090
Are you gonna watch me?

47:09.426 --> 47:12.461
Are you gonna watch me, or are
you gonna turn and look away?

47:12.463 --> 47:14.630
When the second needle
freezes my lungs,

47:14.632 --> 47:16.165
are you gonna scribble scrabble

47:16.167 --> 47:19.836
in your notepad for
future reference?

47:19.838 --> 47:23.105
And when that third
needle stops my heart,

47:23.107 --> 47:26.542
and they pronounce my body dead,

47:26.544 --> 47:29.679
are you gonna anguish
over my death?

47:30.914 --> 47:32.181
Or are you gonna rejoice

47:32.183 --> 47:35.618
that the law of your
land was fulfilled?

47:37.654 --> 47:38.654
- Neither.

47:41.391 --> 47:44.093
- You ever see anyone die, doc?

47:45.395 --> 47:48.931
You ever watch as
the light fades

47:48.933 --> 47:51.968
out of someone's
eyes as they just,

47:53.503 --> 47:55.638
drift away into nothing?

47:59.877 --> 48:03.045
- It's none of your
fucking business.

48:05.449 --> 48:06.582
It's not about me.

48:08.319 --> 48:10.119
- This is about you.

48:11.388 --> 48:15.091
This whole game
has been about you.

48:15.093 --> 48:19.395
Your bullshit cocky attitude
isn't gonna work with me, doc.

48:23.267 --> 48:24.400
- It's not about me.

48:24.402 --> 48:25.635
- I don't,

48:25.637 --> 48:27.770
I don't fucking care
if it's about you.

48:27.772 --> 48:30.406
Fuck your questions, fuck you.

48:31.642 --> 48:32.642
I'm done.

48:34.511 --> 48:38.247
I'm not playing your
fucking games anymore.

48:54.698 --> 48:58.501
- You're done playing
games when I tell you.

48:59.369 --> 49:00.369
Got it?

49:03.974 --> 49:07.109
- Any evidence should have
been destroyed in the fire,

49:07.111 --> 49:10.479
so I figured it was
time to leave the city.

49:27.531 --> 49:29.699
You know who runs this place?

49:29.701 --> 49:32.101
- Mr. Charlie rose.

49:32.103 --> 49:33.736
- Keep the change.

49:52.923 --> 49:57.059
I found an address in
Marty's Texas travel book.

50:08.839 --> 50:10.873
And then there she was.

50:12.109 --> 50:16.812
She was the most beautiful
woman I'd ever laid my eyes on.

50:16.814 --> 50:19.448
- Good evening.
- Hello, Billy.

50:20.217 --> 50:22.785
I believe we have a guest.

50:22.787 --> 50:24.487
- Right over there.

50:27.791 --> 50:29.859
- Aren't you a sweetie.

50:44.174 --> 50:46.075
- I'm sorry, have we met?

50:46.077 --> 50:47.877
- Not exactly.

50:47.879 --> 50:48.879
Olivia.

50:50.113 --> 50:52.081
- Jackson.
- Shea, yes.

51:00.323 --> 51:03.059
Martin bigg was a mutual friend.

51:08.065 --> 51:10.699
Oh don't worry, I'm not a cop.

51:12.469 --> 51:16.272
But that was quite a
job you did on belmont.

51:16.274 --> 51:18.307
- Who says that was me?

51:19.276 --> 51:21.077
- I have my sources.

51:22.746 --> 51:25.981
- I don't like being followed.

51:25.983 --> 51:26.983
- Noted.

51:33.458 --> 51:34.757
Dance with me.

51:40.130 --> 51:43.866
- And you're
too pretty to be a cop.

51:54.411 --> 51:55.978
- I didn't know Martin.

51:55.980 --> 51:58.881
But my father,
very close to him.

52:01.618 --> 52:04.019
- Who's your father?

52:05.288 --> 52:06.655
- Charlie rose.

52:09.359 --> 52:10.659
Just like you.

52:12.095 --> 52:13.896
He's a business man.

52:15.298 --> 52:16.866
- What kinda business?

52:20.270 --> 52:21.670
- Acquisitions.

52:25.876 --> 52:29.545
- How'd you know
where to find me?

52:29.547 --> 52:32.114
- You seen this place?

52:32.116 --> 52:36.085
Somebody new walks into
town, I hear about it.

52:37.454 --> 52:41.757
Besides, little Billy over
there has a sweet spot for me.

52:56.106 --> 52:57.740
Wanna take a ride?

52:59.543 --> 53:00.910
- Lead the way.

53:46.590 --> 53:48.557
- Hi ladies.
- Good morning.

53:48.559 --> 53:51.360
- Hey daddy.
- Well, my daughter's awake.

53:51.362 --> 53:53.562
- Daddy, meet Jack shea.

53:53.564 --> 53:55.297
Jack, meet Charlie.

53:56.433 --> 53:57.466
- Mr. rose.

53:58.902 --> 54:02.137
- Marty never said you
were such a city slicker.

54:02.139 --> 54:04.640
- Is that gonna be a problem?

54:04.642 --> 54:09.445
- No, not a problem, unless
you make it that way.

54:09.447 --> 54:12.047
You all didn't do nothing
together, now, did you?

54:12.049 --> 54:13.182
- Oh, daddy.

54:14.184 --> 54:17.353
- Oh, come on, I'm
just playing with you.

54:17.355 --> 54:20.723
Come on over here
and chat for a while.

54:26.363 --> 54:31.200
Ladies, why don't you go on
inside and cool off a bit?

54:31.202 --> 54:32.735
- Aw, baby.

54:32.737 --> 54:34.203
- Hal?
- Yes sir.

54:34.205 --> 54:36.672
Ladies, outta the pool, now.

54:39.142 --> 54:43.479
- You know I like to
harness the energy of youth.

54:43.481 --> 54:45.080
You want a beer?

54:45.082 --> 54:47.950
- Look, Mr. rose, the
only reason I'm here

54:47.952 --> 54:50.319
is because Marty said he
had a friend in Texas,

54:50.321 --> 54:51.620
and that's it.

54:53.123 --> 54:56.258
- Marty, Marty was
thick as a brick.

54:57.260 --> 55:01.096
But he was a tremendous
judge of character.

55:01.098 --> 55:04.967
Now, from appearance, you look
like you're up to the mark,

55:04.969 --> 55:08.404
but it's what's underneath
that concerns me.

55:08.406 --> 55:12.374
If you'll crack when the
heat gets cranked up.

55:16.179 --> 55:18.781
You gotta keep a low profile.

55:18.783 --> 55:20.382
I've been my entire life,

55:20.384 --> 55:24.620
and I never got so much
as a hockey ticket.

55:24.622 --> 55:27.022
I only do outside
horses and oil,

55:27.024 --> 55:30.859
and I don't shit where i
live, if you catch my drift.

55:30.861 --> 55:35.164
I spend a whole year, an entire
year, on a single project.

55:36.232 --> 55:39.168
But the payoff is
always worthwhile.

55:41.338 --> 55:42.971
And I don't touching nothing,

55:42.973 --> 55:47.409
unless it'll fetch at
least five million U.S.

55:47.411 --> 55:50.112
I use a crew, and i
rotate who's in charge.

55:50.114 --> 55:53.382
Olivia there sometimes
acts as another guy,

55:53.384 --> 55:55.951
when she's not causing chaos.

56:01.391 --> 56:05.361
You know, I never hire a man
unless they're a Texas man.

56:05.363 --> 56:06.862
I just don't trust 'em.

56:06.864 --> 56:09.965
But Marty was a brother to me.

56:09.967 --> 56:12.701
So I'm not gonna throw you out.

56:14.304 --> 56:17.573
But you're gonna have
to prove yourself.

56:17.575 --> 56:20.642
What do you think
there, blue eyes?

56:29.886 --> 56:32.087
- When do we get started?

56:34.724 --> 56:36.859
- How does 75 mil sound?

57:03.687 --> 57:06.422
- Good afternoon, Mr.
And Ms. stroblekowitz.

57:06.424 --> 57:08.490
How're y'all doing today?
- Very well, thank you.

57:08.492 --> 57:10.025
- Mr. beeker's ready for you.

57:10.027 --> 57:11.894
Flynn'll be taking you upstairs.

57:11.896 --> 57:13.662
- Please follow me.

57:13.664 --> 57:15.097
- Thank you.
- Y'all have a great day.

57:15.099 --> 57:16.999
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

57:17.001 --> 57:19.268
Simon beeker was the
President of the largest bank

57:19.270 --> 57:21.804
nobody ever heard of.

57:21.806 --> 57:25.707
Beeker handled overseas
financial transactions,

57:25.709 --> 57:28.177
how the money flowed.

57:28.179 --> 57:31.113
Just none of it
flowed to beeker.

57:31.115 --> 57:35.250
- Mr. beeker,
your clients have arrived.

57:37.454 --> 57:38.454
- Hi.

57:39.289 --> 57:40.389
- Afternoon.

57:40.391 --> 57:43.225
- Please, have a seat.
- Thank you.

57:45.628 --> 57:47.162
- What can I do for you?

57:47.164 --> 57:50.299
- We represent Mr.
Rose's interests.

57:54.537 --> 57:55.771
- Yes, Mr. beeker.

57:55.773 --> 57:58.073
- Cherry, can you
send Paul in, please?

57:58.075 --> 57:59.308
- Right away.

58:01.544 --> 58:02.544
- Um.

58:04.447 --> 58:05.447
I, uh,

58:06.416 --> 58:08.317
I didn't expect you so soon.

58:11.888 --> 58:14.189
- The timeline's moved up.

58:36.646 --> 58:38.280
- Now, Mr. beeker.

58:40.450 --> 58:43.986
We know the vault's
codes change daily.

58:43.988 --> 58:45.988
Now your man, they
show up at 11:00 pm,

58:45.990 --> 58:48.323
not a second sooner or later,

58:48.325 --> 58:50.092
with the codes,
and we're golden.

58:50.094 --> 58:54.329
Anything after that, we're
not gonna do business.

58:56.165 --> 58:57.766
Now, Mr. beeker.

58:57.768 --> 59:02.004
We know that there's 75
million in bonds in that vault.

59:03.339 --> 59:05.641
- 75 mil sounds good.

59:05.643 --> 59:07.609
But this time I'm
the leading man.

59:07.611 --> 59:10.212
- No ma'am, you are not.
- Oh yes sir, I am.

59:10.214 --> 59:12.681
- I beg your pardon,
missy, but you are not.

59:12.683 --> 59:13.683
- Daddy.

59:16.219 --> 59:17.219
- Okay.

59:17.921 --> 59:21.089
You wanna wheel and deal, missy?

59:21.091 --> 59:22.858
You take hal.

59:22.860 --> 59:24.793
- Got you, boss.

59:24.795 --> 59:27.596
I'll take real good care of her.

59:30.233 --> 59:32.534
- No, I am not taking hal.

59:34.070 --> 59:35.704
Do we have a deal?

59:36.739 --> 59:39.408
- Mr. rose's cut is 10
cents on the dollar.

59:39.410 --> 59:41.443
Do I make myself clear?

59:44.681 --> 59:46.748
- Yeah, that's understood.

59:46.750 --> 59:51.620
- Alright then, pleasure
doing business with you.

59:51.622 --> 59:53.522
- Okay, deal, no hal.

59:56.225 --> 59:57.859
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:14.009
- I was happy.

01:00:14.011 --> 01:00:16.645
It seemed like, just for once,

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:20.182
god smiled down on me.

01:00:20.184 --> 01:00:22.918
- You know how much I love you?

01:00:24.854 --> 01:00:26.588
I love you so much.

01:00:34.931 --> 01:00:36.832
- I love you forever.

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:53.515
- Yeah.

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:55.884
- I got a job, I need a driver.

01:00:55.886 --> 01:00:57.352
- Yeah, I can drive.

01:00:57.354 --> 01:00:58.320
How much?

01:00:58.322 --> 01:01:00.188
- The usual amount.

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:01.523
- What time do
y'all need me there?

01:01:01.525 --> 01:01:02.858
- Couple days.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:04.259
Keep your phone on.

01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:05.794
I'll be in touch.

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:08.497
It's done.

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:16.438
- Sometimes you gotta keep
the training wheels on,

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.408
even though they
wanna roll alone.

01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:49.905
- We cased the place.

01:01:49.907 --> 01:01:52.040
We had blueprints,
guard schedules,

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:53.475
and Charlie even had a duplicate

01:01:53.477 --> 01:01:57.112
of the security system
made for me to practice.

01:01:57.114 --> 01:01:59.948
We had all the bases covered.

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:01.383
- Okay.

01:02:15.031 --> 01:02:17.299
- We look like we're
dressed for a funeral.

01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:18.567
- I see you brought
your boyfriends,

01:02:18.569 --> 01:02:19.634
did you bring the codes?

01:02:19.636 --> 01:02:21.236
- That's why we're here, Jack.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:23.472
- Then let's get to work.

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:27.142
- Hey, keep an eye on
the scanners, alright?

01:02:27.144 --> 01:02:30.178
Make sure all the
edges are sealed.

01:02:54.303 --> 01:02:55.804
This is beeker's private floor.

01:02:55.806 --> 01:02:57.939
There's no cameras here.

01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:01.042
There you go.

01:03:02.512 --> 01:03:06.815
Beeker put the security
cameras in the vault on loop.

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:08.817
Nice.

01:03:11.754 --> 01:03:16.057
We got an hour, then beeker
will be here to get his cut.

01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:23.431
- Codes.

01:03:25.334 --> 01:03:26.668
- Here.

01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:29.905
- If even one of those
numbers is wrong,

01:03:29.907 --> 01:03:32.007
half the police department'll
show up outside.

01:03:32.009 --> 01:03:33.475
- Listen, little lady.

01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:34.943
I got it from beeker himself.

01:03:34.945 --> 01:03:37.479
Wrote the numbers down
exactly the way he told me.

01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:39.281
- Pressure changes things.

01:03:39.283 --> 01:03:42.884
Makes a man write a
six instead of a nine.

01:03:42.886 --> 01:03:45.086
- Not beeker, the man's ice.

01:03:45.088 --> 01:03:47.522
- I was talking about you.

01:03:47.524 --> 01:03:50.258
- You two about done bickering?

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:57.098
- Your husband's a prick.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:59.568
You could do so much better.

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:09.911
Yo, what's it doing?

01:04:09.913 --> 01:04:11.646
- It's synchronized the alarms,

01:04:11.648 --> 01:04:13.315
it's deciphering
codes in stages.

01:04:13.317 --> 01:04:16.218
Each stage has a
different color.

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:34.669
- What the hell
are we waiting for?

01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:41.376
- That.

01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:51.319
- Beeker's in the Van.

01:04:51.321 --> 01:04:53.421
We'll split the bonds up there.

01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:55.590
- You know,
something's been bothering me.

01:04:55.592 --> 01:04:57.659
Now why would beeker
show up here in person

01:04:57.661 --> 01:04:59.794
and put himself at risk?

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:09.571
- Fuck.

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:17.646
- Olivia, stay down.

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.935
- Olivia, we
gotta get the fuck out now.

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:41.336
- I'm not leaving Jack.

01:05:41.338 --> 01:05:42.904
- Don't worry
about me, go with him.

01:05:42.906 --> 01:05:44.372
Get out of here.

01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:52.881
- Unlock this door.

01:05:52.883 --> 01:05:54.723
- Look, I can't help
Jack, I can only help you.

01:05:56.653 --> 01:06:01.356
- You are not leaving Jack.

01:06:01.358 --> 01:06:03.625
- I'm getting
paid, motherfucker.

01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:15.103
- Jack, oh Jack,
you out there, son?

01:06:16.072 --> 01:06:18.907
Listen I got a
confession to make, pal.

01:06:18.909 --> 01:06:20.542
Your wife whispered in my ear

01:06:20.544 --> 01:06:23.244
that she wants to suck my dick.

01:06:23.246 --> 01:06:24.546
You like that?

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:28.483
I'll make you a deal.

01:06:30.019 --> 01:06:33.822
You give me what's mine
and I'll let you go.

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:36.992
It wasn't supposed to
be like this, Jack.

01:06:36.994 --> 01:06:37.926
- Oh yeah?

01:06:37.928 --> 01:06:39.227
How was it supposed to be?

01:06:39.229 --> 01:06:41.029
You kill us and take the bonds?

01:06:41.031 --> 01:06:44.566
- You got it.

01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:49.437
Hey, get the fuck out there.

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:58.046
Nice shot, Jack.

01:06:59.281 --> 01:07:00.815
Too bad it wasn't me.

01:07:00.817 --> 01:07:02.417
Listen, fuck beeker.

01:07:02.419 --> 01:07:04.552
Why should he get the money?

01:07:04.554 --> 01:07:08.857
Me and you, we split
the money, 50/50.

01:07:08.859 --> 01:07:10.425
How's that sound?

01:07:10.427 --> 01:07:11.993
- Sounds like bullshit.

01:07:17.767 --> 01:07:18.800
- Hey Jack.

01:07:18.802 --> 01:07:23.104
After I kill you, I'm gonna
fuck that little whore of yours.

01:07:23.106 --> 01:07:25.006
You keep what's mine.

01:07:53.169 --> 01:07:54.169
Oh shit.

01:07:58.475 --> 01:07:59.774
You hear that?

01:08:01.143 --> 01:08:04.646
We're both gonna go
to fucking prison.

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:11.853
You wouldn't, uh,

01:08:11.855 --> 01:08:14.823
you wouldn't shoot a man
in the back, would you?

01:08:18.327 --> 01:08:19.727
- Yes, I would.

01:08:26.301 --> 01:08:29.636
Gun, he's got a gun.

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:33.308
Geez, we got a situation here.

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:34.776
Call for backup.

01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:51.725
- Margaret, don't
bring it up again.

01:08:51.728 --> 01:08:56.029
Just tell the guys there's
a ladder in the garage,

01:08:56.032 --> 01:09:00.568
or we'll rent theirs, 'cause
they'll charge you rent.

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:03.071
And have them climb
up on the roof

01:09:03.073 --> 01:09:06.808
and don't tell 'em we
don't have insurance.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.979
No, I'm not gonna
discuss it with you now,

01:09:10.981 --> 01:09:13.381
I'll do it when I get home.

01:09:18.487 --> 01:09:20.587
- Warden.

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:23.291
- How're you, sir?
- I'm fine.

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:26.594
- Thank you for your
service to your client.

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:28.529
But you are done here, sir.

01:09:28.532 --> 01:09:29.930
- Thank you.

01:09:29.933 --> 01:09:32.000
- I love the word
barrister, I always have.

01:09:32.002 --> 01:09:35.502
And you have the
best job in America,

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:37.971
when you become a judge.

01:09:37.974 --> 01:09:39.874
Because every day
you get to go to work

01:09:39.876 --> 01:09:42.644
with a chance to be fair.

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:46.113
- Thanks again, warden.
- Good day, sir.

01:09:47.416 --> 01:09:49.951
See, it's part of my job.

01:09:49.953 --> 01:09:52.153
And your job is
trying to be spiderman

01:09:52.154 --> 01:09:56.391
and climb up to second
stories and do bad things.

01:09:58.060 --> 01:09:59.761
And you got caught.

01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:13.675
Would you rather have the
water warmer or colder?

01:10:24.853 --> 01:10:25.853
Strip.

01:10:29.124 --> 01:10:30.358
Full frontal.

01:10:32.461 --> 01:10:33.695
Very good, you'll do.

01:10:33.697 --> 01:10:34.929
You don't need to cover it, bud,

01:10:34.931 --> 01:10:38.499
we couldn't be shocked
by anything you'd have.

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.708
Hello son.
- Sir.

01:10:48.944 --> 01:10:50.979
- How're you today, sir?
- Good, sir.

01:10:50.981 --> 01:10:52.080
- Good.

01:10:52.082 --> 01:10:53.314
How about you?

01:10:53.316 --> 01:10:54.515
- About ready
to get out of here.

01:10:54.517 --> 01:10:56.084
- Very good, sir.

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:01.790
Hey.

01:11:06.562 --> 01:11:08.496
Well, that didn't work.

01:11:08.498 --> 01:11:10.565
Maybe you're just rude.

01:11:12.901 --> 01:11:15.103
You don't have manners.

01:11:15.105 --> 01:11:19.407
When one of your betters is
outside and front of the bars,

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:22.610
you stand up, turn around,

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:25.580
and look him in
the goddamned eye.

01:11:33.422 --> 01:11:35.723
That's more like it.

01:11:35.725 --> 01:11:37.859
You know what I need from you?

01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:39.260
Your attention.

01:11:40.529 --> 01:11:41.763
And I'm gonna demand it

01:11:41.765 --> 01:11:45.133
every time I look in
your fucking eyes.

01:11:50.773 --> 01:11:54.075
How're you enjoying
our fine facility?

01:11:55.944 --> 01:11:58.846
I hope it's up to
your standards.

01:12:00.349 --> 01:12:02.183
Is it to your liking?

01:12:04.019 --> 01:12:06.154
Or have you seen better?

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:11.859
Or would you rather be
in a hole underground?

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:14.462
Can you hear me?!

01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:19.867
Because it's
important you hear me.

01:12:19.869 --> 01:12:21.936
Every time I've ever
looked in your face,

01:12:21.938 --> 01:12:23.971
even back in my office,

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:29.010
you never took your eyes off me.

01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:32.246
I'm not that fucking
attractive, bud.

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:39.654
You always give me
that gold stare,

01:12:39.656 --> 01:12:43.324
it don't mean shit to me,
you're not gonna scare me down.

01:12:43.326 --> 01:12:45.293
You understand that, don't you?

01:12:45.295 --> 01:12:49.130
I don't care how bad
you think you are.

01:12:49.132 --> 01:12:52.367
You're not as bad
as the executioner.

01:13:45.687 --> 01:13:47.889
- Hey, fish.

01:13:49.626 --> 01:13:50.992
Got my jollies?

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:53.961
Do you know what's
happening here?

01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:55.163
You know what's happening?

01:13:55.165 --> 01:13:56.998
- Fuck off.
- Party, motherfucker.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.800
A big party.

01:13:58.802 --> 01:14:00.101
Get over here.

01:14:01.069 --> 01:14:03.538
- I'm gonna skullfuck
you, pretty boy.

01:15:08.937 --> 01:15:12.640
- A little
present from the warden.

01:15:49.978 --> 01:15:51.679
- Hell yeah, that's what's up.

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:53.414
- What the fuck are you?

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:15.069
- Remember me, motherfucker?

01:16:33.221 --> 01:16:36.958
- You've been up to a
lot of bad shit, son.

01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:52.039
Why do I stay?

01:16:55.944 --> 01:16:58.980
You know what I stay,
'cause I like bad guys.

01:16:58.982 --> 01:17:02.516
Because they don't
wanna be bad guys.

01:17:02.518 --> 01:17:04.919
And a lot of 'em think
we're the bad guys,

01:17:04.921 --> 01:17:06.554
and I'm a bad guy.

01:17:08.156 --> 01:17:12.460
And I like criminals,
professionals at what they do.

01:17:12.462 --> 01:17:14.895
I particularly like
the second story man,

01:17:14.897 --> 01:17:17.765
'cause he's gotta be
athletic, he's gotta be agile.

01:17:17.767 --> 01:17:19.634
He's gotta think.

01:17:19.636 --> 01:17:21.435
You put all that
ingenuity together,

01:17:21.437 --> 01:17:24.572
and you wonder, why can't
we all just get along?

01:17:24.574 --> 01:17:28.042
- What's your
proposition, warden?

01:17:28.044 --> 01:17:31.912
- You know the difference
between a criminal,

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:34.615
and a law man?

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:39.620
One,

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:47.428
lives rent free, three
meals a day, a bed.

01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:48.729
The other one,

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:55.369
can't even pay his rent.

01:17:57.539 --> 01:18:01.442
And our uncle, who lives
back there on the east coast,

01:18:01.444 --> 01:18:04.245
doesn't pay people like me shit.

01:18:05.714 --> 01:18:09.216
Now I'm thinking
of retiring soon.

01:18:09.218 --> 01:18:11.519
And I got three daughters.

01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:14.655
So you do the math.

01:18:16.024 --> 01:18:17.458
- You know what
the real difference

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:20.561
is between crooks and
law men is, warden?

01:18:20.563 --> 01:18:21.962
- Try me.

01:18:21.964 --> 01:18:25.332
- What side of the
bars they're on.

01:18:25.334 --> 01:18:26.801
- That's clever.

01:18:27.736 --> 01:18:29.270
With a mind like that,

01:18:29.272 --> 01:18:32.106
you should be nowhere near
an institution like this.

01:18:32.108 --> 01:18:34.208
You wanna stay here
the rest of your life?

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:36.110
Or you wanna be out there?

01:18:36.112 --> 01:18:37.578
You want your girl
running around,

01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:41.816
outside the walls of this
prison, looking like she does?

01:18:41.818 --> 01:18:43.617
Without supervision?

01:18:44.619 --> 01:18:46.187
I don't think so.

01:18:47.956 --> 01:18:52.093
Now, in your own mind,
are you better in or out?

01:18:53.161 --> 01:18:56.163
Because that's what
we're talking about.

01:18:56.165 --> 01:18:58.966
So let's make a deal,
and you can take a hike,

01:18:58.968 --> 01:19:02.203
and I can quit being
a fucking warden.

01:19:04.706 --> 01:19:05.940
If you're gonna
make a deal with me,

01:19:05.942 --> 01:19:08.309
you're gonna shake my hand.

01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:14.749
Deal.

01:19:25.127 --> 01:19:27.261
- The warden's
proposition was simple.

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:28.896
Some snitch had let it slip

01:19:28.898 --> 01:19:32.266
that a drug deal was
going down by the border.

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:36.370
Having me get the cash
kept his hands clean.

01:19:36.372 --> 01:19:39.306
And in return, I got a
get outta jail free card

01:19:39.308 --> 01:19:43.978
with a new identity, and
a second chance at life.

01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:48.282
And lucky for me, there was
a goodhearted woman waiting.

01:19:57.259 --> 01:19:58.325
- You okay?

01:19:59.194 --> 01:20:01.796
You don't have to do this.

01:20:01.798 --> 01:20:04.265
We can go away, start again.

01:20:07.569 --> 01:20:11.205
- We'll just have to
do it someplace else.

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:13.207
- Warden.
- Yeah.

01:20:13.209 --> 01:20:15.843
- Yeah, we're here,
we're packing in.

01:20:15.845 --> 01:20:18.879
- Just stay with
him until the deal's done.

01:20:18.881 --> 01:20:20.881
You understand that, right?

01:20:20.883 --> 01:20:21.883
- Got it.

01:20:36.998 --> 01:20:40.801
You better be the shot
you say you are, boy.

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:06.160
I can't see a goddamn thing.

01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:21.609
- Get ready with the bullhorn.

01:21:48.136 --> 01:21:50.237
- No one else needs to get hurt.

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:52.773
You just do exactly what I say.

01:21:52.775 --> 01:21:57.378
Drop your guns, throw your
keys, and keep walking.

01:21:57.380 --> 01:22:00.014
Walk away and don't look back.

01:22:02.717 --> 01:22:05.686
- You only killed
two, goddamn it.

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:09.423
- There's no need
to kill the rest.

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:12.459
- I'll say what is
needed, convict.

01:22:45.193 --> 01:22:47.861
- Drugs weren't
part of the deal.

01:22:47.863 --> 01:22:49.830
- Your deal, not ours.

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:25.599
- Yeah.
- Warden.

01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:27.968
They checked into the
motel you got 'em.

01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:29.269
- That's good.

01:23:30.138 --> 01:23:32.039
You know what the story is.

01:23:32.041 --> 01:23:33.640
- Yeah.

01:23:33.642 --> 01:23:36.276
- You know what you have to do.

01:23:36.278 --> 01:23:38.012
Got it?
- Copy that.

01:23:51.726 --> 01:23:53.293
- Warden's man took the drugs,

01:23:53.295 --> 01:23:56.263
but I held onto the money.

01:23:56.265 --> 01:23:58.265
He'd meet me at the
hotel in the morning,

01:23:58.267 --> 01:24:01.935
and I'd exchange his
money for my new life.

01:24:14.349 --> 01:24:18.052
In the morning we'll just
give this money to Morton.

01:24:18.054 --> 01:24:19.453
And we're done.

01:24:20.688 --> 01:24:22.489
- I don't know.

01:24:22.491 --> 01:24:24.858
This whole thing feels off.

01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:32.099
Promise me, this
is the last one.

01:24:34.135 --> 01:24:35.669
I can't lose you.

01:24:44.512 --> 01:24:46.246
- On one condition.

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:56.090
Will you spend the rest
of your life with me?

01:24:56.092 --> 01:24:57.092
- Yes.

01:25:03.566 --> 01:25:04.698
- Try it on.

01:25:09.238 --> 01:25:10.238
It fits.

01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:13.073
What do you think?

01:25:13.075 --> 01:25:14.608
- It's beautiful.

01:25:20.216 --> 01:25:23.350
- Tell me how it
looks in the light.

01:25:25.453 --> 01:25:26.753
- It sparkles.

01:25:28.223 --> 01:25:30.757
- It sparkles like your eyes.

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:35.095
- I love it.
- I hope so.

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:43.604
- You spoiled me.

01:25:44.672 --> 01:25:47.407
- When all this is done,
we'll have enough money.

01:25:47.409 --> 01:25:48.842
We'll start over again.

01:25:48.844 --> 01:25:53.147
We're gonna have a house,
maybe two baby boys.

01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:54.581
I'll even retire, you know,

01:25:54.583 --> 01:25:59.019
be a postman like a regular
old job or something.

01:25:59.021 --> 01:26:03.257
Just to be able to wake up
every morning next to you.

01:26:03.259 --> 01:26:06.560
What do you think
about that, babe?

01:26:06.562 --> 01:26:08.428
- I love you so much.

01:26:10.098 --> 01:26:11.732
- I'm glad you do.

01:26:19.274 --> 01:26:22.009
- Thank you, baby.

01:26:27.215 --> 01:26:28.615
- Baby, get down.

01:26:37.292 --> 01:26:39.793
- Go on, get him.

01:27:04.653 --> 01:27:05.886
- Baby.

01:27:05.888 --> 01:27:06.888
It's okay.

01:27:10.592 --> 01:27:14.161
No no, babe, no you're
okay, you're okay.

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:20.033
You're okay, hey,
you're gonna be okay.

01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:23.103
Olivia.

01:27:24.138 --> 01:27:25.772
Please stay awake.

01:27:26.741 --> 01:27:27.975
Just a little longer,

01:27:27.977 --> 01:27:31.345
we're gonna get that
house I promised you.

01:27:31.347 --> 01:27:32.347
Okay.

01:27:33.681 --> 01:27:35.816
We got a lot left to do.

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.420
- I love you, Jack.

01:27:46.427 --> 01:27:47.427
- Olivia.

01:27:54.969 --> 01:27:55.969
I'm sorry.

01:28:05.179 --> 01:28:06.179
Olivia.

01:28:07.749 --> 01:28:10.550
Please.

01:28:37.146 --> 01:28:38.146
Tick.

01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:40.380
Tick tock.

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:42.416
Tick tock.

01:28:43.718 --> 01:28:44.718
Tick tock.

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:47.321
Tick tock.

01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:49.790
Tick tock.

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:52.826
Tick tock.

01:28:54.462 --> 01:28:55.462
Tick.

01:28:57.432 --> 01:28:58.432
Tock.

01:29:01.203 --> 01:29:02.203
Tick.

01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:05.372
Tock.

01:29:09.844 --> 01:29:11.211
And so it goes.

01:29:13.614 --> 01:29:15.749
- This was good.

01:29:15.751 --> 01:29:18.151
This was a lot of progress.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:19.920
And,

01:29:21.589 --> 01:29:22.923
tomorrow we'll get
to the underlying...

01:29:22.925 --> 01:29:26.727
- tomorrow I have a
date with a real doctor.

01:29:31.265 --> 01:29:34.067
You know what the worst part is?

01:29:36.371 --> 01:29:39.673
Nobody's gonna be
there to see me off.

01:29:45.146 --> 01:29:46.146
Anyway.

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:52.085
It was nice talking
with you, Amanda.

01:29:54.021 --> 01:29:55.489
- You too, Jack.

01:31:59.013 --> 01:32:01.681
- I am telling you, he's
one nasty son of a bitch.

01:32:01.683 --> 01:32:04.351
He hires young, he pays more
than all his competitors,

01:32:04.353 --> 01:32:06.953
and when he gets his hooks
in 'em, he doesn't let go.

01:32:06.955 --> 01:32:08.154
- Check all his analysts.

01:32:08.156 --> 01:32:09.523
Even his guys down
there in the trenches,

01:32:09.525 --> 01:32:10.790
they're bound to make a mistake.

01:32:10.792 --> 01:32:12.425
And when they do,
we will be ready.

01:32:12.427 --> 01:32:13.927
We will be ready.

01:32:13.929 --> 01:32:15.695
Good work, Mr. Cartwright.
- Thank you.

01:32:15.697 --> 01:32:16.830
- Good work.

01:32:21.302 --> 01:32:23.336
Jill, give us a minute.

01:32:24.338 --> 01:32:27.474
- Yeah sure, no problem.
- Thank you.

01:32:28.543 --> 01:32:29.676
- Dr. Tyler.

01:32:35.116 --> 01:32:38.585
- There you go.
- What do you got for me?

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:55.368
You can't be serious.
- I'm serious.

01:32:58.139 --> 01:33:00.173
- Texas versus Johnson.

01:33:01.475 --> 01:33:02.475
Okay.

01:33:04.345 --> 01:33:07.747
You claim you wanna
save lives, doctor.

01:33:08.749 --> 01:33:11.284
You preach fighting
the good fight.

01:33:11.286 --> 01:33:13.687
You wave your flag of justice
around your lecture hall

01:33:13.689 --> 01:33:15.922
like some avenging angel.

01:33:16.724 --> 01:33:17.724
But this?

01:33:18.759 --> 01:33:21.494
This is not a case study.

01:33:21.496 --> 01:33:24.431
This is not about theorizing,
glorifying, or grandstanding.

01:33:24.433 --> 01:33:28.301
Dr. Tyler, this is
about paying a debt.

01:33:28.303 --> 01:33:30.770
It's not just a debt to the
families of the victims,

01:33:30.772 --> 01:33:32.906
but to society, righting
a terrible wrong,

01:33:32.908 --> 01:33:34.541
and preventing future wrongs.

01:33:34.543 --> 01:33:35.976
Protecting the innocent.

01:33:35.978 --> 01:33:37.577
And you, of all people,
should understand that

01:33:37.579 --> 01:33:39.579
since your husband was murdered.

01:33:39.581 --> 01:33:40.947
Am I correct?

01:33:40.949 --> 01:33:42.082
- Yeah, you're correct.

01:33:42.084 --> 01:33:43.516
My husband was murdered.

01:33:43.518 --> 01:33:44.851
So let me ask you a question.

01:33:44.853 --> 01:33:46.086
- Shoot.

01:33:46.088 --> 01:33:48.321
- What if this time,
perpetuating the cycle

01:33:48.323 --> 01:33:50.323
and continuing down
the wrong path,

01:33:50.325 --> 01:33:52.659
and protecting a broken system,

01:33:52.661 --> 01:33:54.361
isn't what's best for society?

01:33:54.363 --> 01:33:56.730
- System's far from
broken, doctor.

01:33:56.732 --> 01:33:59.065
We're traveling down a path
humanity's been navigating

01:33:59.067 --> 01:34:01.301
since the dawn of society.

01:34:01.303 --> 01:34:02.535
Law and order.

01:34:02.537 --> 01:34:03.737
Crime and punishment.

01:34:03.739 --> 01:34:05.538
Tit for tat.

01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:07.807
Without this system in
place, we will surely

01:34:07.809 --> 01:34:11.177
be living in a constant
state of hypersensitivity.

01:34:11.179 --> 01:34:12.579
Wouldn't you say?

01:34:12.581 --> 01:34:14.447
- No, we've moved beyond that.

01:34:14.449 --> 01:34:17.384
We are past reacting off of
just our primal instinct.

01:34:17.386 --> 01:34:19.886
- We've moved beyond.

01:34:19.888 --> 01:34:21.354
Okay, doc. Okay.

01:34:23.057 --> 01:34:25.859
Look who you're talking to here.

01:34:26.961 --> 01:34:29.095
You're gonna sit here
and tell me this.

01:34:29.097 --> 01:34:31.297
Even though an educated black
man in a three piece suit

01:34:31.299 --> 01:34:32.699
right here in the
good state of Texas

01:34:32.701 --> 01:34:33.933
can't run down the street

01:34:33.935 --> 01:34:35.802
without possibly being
mistaken for a criminal

01:34:35.804 --> 01:34:38.038
and shot down like a dog?

01:34:39.073 --> 01:34:41.274
That we have evolved.

01:34:41.276 --> 01:34:44.644
I'd have to argue
against that, doctor.

01:34:48.417 --> 01:34:50.116
It's a delicate balance.

01:34:50.118 --> 01:34:53.486
Punish too harshly,
you have a revolt.

01:34:53.488 --> 01:34:56.256
Don't punish enough,
you have anarchy.

01:34:56.258 --> 01:34:59.993
See, the very fear of violence
keeps violence at bay.

01:34:59.995 --> 01:35:01.695
By not responding to
violence with violence,

01:35:01.697 --> 01:35:03.763
we take away that fear,

01:35:04.999 --> 01:35:06.533
and we take away the very thing

01:35:06.535 --> 01:35:07.734
that keeps our system intact.

01:35:07.736 --> 01:35:09.369
So no, doctor, our
system is not broken,

01:35:09.371 --> 01:35:11.237
we are not headed
down the wrong path.

01:35:11.239 --> 01:35:13.807
I'm doing my job for society.

01:35:15.443 --> 01:35:18.678
Whether you are or
not is yet to be seen.

01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:21.648
- What about
compassion and empathy?

01:35:21.650 --> 01:35:23.049
And mercy?

01:35:23.051 --> 01:35:24.051
- Mercy.

01:35:27.288 --> 01:35:29.823
We're all just pieces
on the board, doctor.

01:35:29.825 --> 01:35:32.525
We're just pieces on the board.

01:35:33.527 --> 01:35:35.161
- Yeah, well, at
the end of the game,

01:35:35.163 --> 01:35:39.833
the king and the pawns
go in the same damn box.

01:35:39.835 --> 01:35:41.234
You don't wanna help me?

01:35:41.236 --> 01:35:44.370
I'll take it to the
governor myself.

01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:01.221
- Time to go.

01:37:26.807 --> 01:37:28.141
- Yea, though I walk through

01:37:28.143 --> 01:37:30.143
the valley of the
shadow of death,

01:37:30.145 --> 01:37:33.546
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

01:37:33.548 --> 01:37:36.850
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me,

01:37:36.852 --> 01:37:38.651
surely the goodness of mercy

01:37:38.653 --> 01:37:41.654
shall follow me all
the days of my life.

01:37:41.656 --> 01:37:45.959
And I will dwell in the
house of the lord forever.

01:38:19.793 --> 01:38:23.096
- Any last words, shea?

01:38:56.196 --> 01:38:58.598
- The worst part is,

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:01.834
nobody's gonna be
there to see me off.

01:39:52.152 --> 01:39:53.353
- I love you.

01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:01.894
I'll see you soon.

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:00.753
- Violence.

01:41:01.622 --> 01:41:03.256
What is the cause?

01:41:04.258 --> 01:41:06.192
To truly understand
the nature of violence,

01:41:06.194 --> 01:41:09.362
we need to look
beyond the individual.

01:41:09.364 --> 01:41:11.197
We need to look at the
culture of violence

01:41:11.199 --> 01:41:13.032
that permeates our society.

01:41:13.034 --> 01:41:14.534
And we also need
to look at the way

01:41:14.536 --> 01:41:16.903
that we punish those that
commit acts of violence.

01:41:16.905 --> 01:41:19.739
Because when we answer
violence with violence

01:41:19.741 --> 01:41:21.908
and trade death for death,

01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:26.379
all we're doing is
perpetuating a vicious cycle.

01:41:26.381 --> 01:41:28.247
- But what if someone
you love was murdered?

01:41:28.249 --> 01:41:29.482
Would you feel that answering

01:41:29.484 --> 01:41:32.785
violence with violence
is appropriate?

01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:45.865
- I believe I would
feel that in the moment.

01:41:45.867 --> 01:41:47.266
But I wouldn't want
their deaths avenged

01:41:47.268 --> 01:41:50.136
by a cruel and
capricious system.
