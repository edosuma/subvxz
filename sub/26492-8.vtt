00:08.258 --> 00:09.843
[narrator] <i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:

00:09.926 --> 00:11.302
I can't go back to Riverdale.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.680
[Jughead] Hiram will follow you, or us,
wherever we go.

00:13.763 --> 00:15.098
Where is he?

00:15.181 --> 00:17.475
-[Archie] What's the plan?
-We'll go see my mom.

00:17.559 --> 00:20.311
[Betty] Seizures aren't contagious.
So, what?

00:20.395 --> 00:22.981
[Alice] The Sisters protected me.
They protected Polly.

00:23.064 --> 00:25.859
-They'll watch over you.
-[Jughead] They make drugs in the prison,

00:25.942 --> 00:29.070
which the kids take when they play G&G.
It's connected, Archie.

00:29.154 --> 00:32.574
<i>[Betty] What kind of business does</i>
<i>Hiram Lodge have with Sister Woodhouse?</i>

00:32.657 --> 00:34.701
<i>How are the Blossoms connected to it?</i>

00:34.784 --> 00:37.829
You've been a very bad girl, Betty.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.748
You haven't been taking your candy.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.666
Wonderful, wonderful work.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.668
[Betty] <i>My king, my savior.</i>

00:47.088 --> 00:48.631
[Jughead] <i>It was a day like any other.</i>

00:50.675 --> 00:52.552
<i>Everything seemed normal.</i>

00:52.635 --> 00:53.887
<i>Students went to class.</i>

00:54.471 --> 00:57.015
<i>The Vixens prepared</i>
<i>for the annual pep rally.</i>

00:58.558 --> 01:01.603
<i>Couples had their stolen moments</i>
<i>in quiet classrooms.</i>

01:03.021 --> 01:04.230
Wanna take another hit?

01:04.314 --> 01:05.315
Less talking.
More kissing.

01:07.817 --> 01:10.862
[Jughead] <i>But in Riverdale,</i>
<i>there's no such thing as normal,</i>

01:11.196 --> 01:13.323
<i>as Cheryl Blossom was about to discover.</i>

01:13.531 --> 01:14.866
[Cheryl screaming]

01:22.540 --> 01:24.918
Help! Help us! Somebody, help!

01:25.001 --> 01:27.629
[Ethel] <i>"Your group is stricken.</i>
<i>Infected with poison.</i>

01:28.296 --> 01:29.380
Compromised.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.509
And now, you're all alone.

01:33.009 --> 01:36.096
You hear the heavy scraping footsteps

01:36.638 --> 01:38.681
of some horrific monstrosity."

01:39.099 --> 01:41.309
Girls, time for your candy.

01:49.692 --> 01:51.236
[coughing]

02:04.207 --> 02:05.291
[sighs]

02:12.298 --> 02:14.801
-This is definitely the place.
-You guys lost?

02:15.510 --> 02:19.139
-Or you looking to pick up some merch?
-We're looking for Gladys Jones.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.267
I'm family. We need a place to stay.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.104
-Jughead?
-Jellybean?

02:27.981 --> 02:29.774
Thought I smelled something rotten.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.443
You heard him.

02:33.111 --> 02:34.320
Open the damn gate.

02:38.366 --> 02:39.534
[Jellybean chuckles]

02:40.743 --> 02:41.995
[both chuckling]

02:49.377 --> 02:53.882
You, <i>mon petit amour,</i>
are officially on bed rest.

02:54.549 --> 02:57.135
I've brewed you a pot
of vintage narcissus tea.

02:57.302 --> 03:00.346
And our family physician,
Dr. Caligari, is on call,

03:00.847 --> 03:02.974
should you feel
another spell coming along.

03:03.057 --> 03:04.434
I'm feeling much better, Cheryl.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.563
But what if what happened to me
is contagious?

03:09.147 --> 03:10.231
Oh, Tee-Tee.

03:11.107 --> 03:12.942
Ship's fever couldn't keep me away.

03:13.943 --> 03:16.988
My four-poster bed
is your four-poster bed.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.365
Stay here for as long as you like.

03:20.742 --> 03:21.576
Even...
permanently?

03:24.454 --> 03:25.496
You mean like...

03:26.748 --> 03:31.419
-move in with you?
-I'm cuckoo bananas for you, obvi.

03:32.378 --> 03:33.379
Won't you move in?

03:34.714 --> 03:35.548
As long...

03:36.633 --> 03:38.218
as I'm the big spoon.

03:40.136 --> 03:41.179
[chuckling]

03:44.849 --> 03:47.018
[Hermione] You said
if I went along with this,

03:47.101 --> 03:49.229
no one would get hurt,
especially Veronica.

03:50.438 --> 03:53.107
You looked into my eyes and promised.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.485
I believed you, Hiram.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.904
-[Hiram] It's under control.
-[Hermione] No. I supported you.

03:57.987 --> 03:59.906
You swore to me that this wouldn't happen.

03:59.989 --> 04:01.950
[Hiram] It was a miscalculation.

04:02.033 --> 04:05.411
Now, on strife comes opportunity.
And now the timing is perfect.

04:05.495 --> 04:06.746
What is going on?

04:07.622 --> 04:08.581
Why am I back here?

04:09.332 --> 04:10.458
Veronica.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.585
Thank God you are awake.

04:12.710 --> 04:15.004
We brought you home
as soon as Weatherbee called us.
-You had a seizure, <i>mija.</i>
-What?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.842
It's all this stress you've been under.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.178
Getting dropped by Archie,
running two businesses.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.348
Which is why we've decided
to send you to New York.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.225
You'll finally get some rest.

04:27.308 --> 04:31.187
-We'll get you in with the best doctors.
-Uh, I'm not leaving town.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.606
Sheriff Minetta's body
turns up gangland style,

04:33.690 --> 04:36.901
without his hands or head,
and you wanna ship me off to New York?

04:37.068 --> 04:37.986
Why?

04:39.529 --> 04:40.530
No answer?

04:40.863 --> 04:41.990
Fascinating.

04:43.741 --> 04:47.328
My parents are up to something, Reggie.
They're always up to something,

04:47.412 --> 04:50.164
but they tried to banish me to New York,

04:50.415 --> 04:52.208
which is a new one for them.

04:52.292 --> 04:56.170
It's like they don't want me around
for whatever's coming next.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.214
[doorbell jingles, then boys laughing]

05:02.135 --> 05:03.511
Oh, my God.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.555
Has everyone lost their minds?

05:06.639 --> 05:08.850
Is jingle-jangle suddenly a thing again?

05:09.517 --> 05:10.643
That was so last year.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.270
I'm not sure it's the jingle.

05:13.688 --> 05:17.400
Your dad's pulling it off the market,
and replacing it with some new candy.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.777
-Fizzle Rocks.
-Dealt by the Ghoulies?

05:19.861 --> 05:21.446
No, a new gang.

05:22.655 --> 05:23.865
The Gargoyles.

05:24.699 --> 05:25.533
[scoffs]

05:25.616 --> 05:28.661
With ties, no doubt, to this godforsaken

05:28.745 --> 05:30.621
G&G everyone's playing.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.207
And what, pray tell, is my father's skin

05:33.291 --> 05:35.168
in that particular game, I wonder?

05:35.251 --> 05:36.461
Reggie?

05:36.794 --> 05:38.838
I need you to do some sussing for me,

05:39.005 --> 05:42.258
and find out what you can
about these Fizzle Rocks.

05:43.384 --> 05:44.344
On it.

05:44.427 --> 05:47.680
Last year I helped my parents spin
their criminal web,

05:47.764 --> 05:51.100
and good people, like Archie, got hurt.

05:51.684 --> 05:54.103
This year I'm gonna be a fly
in their ointment.

05:54.729 --> 05:58.107
Whatever they're up to, I will stop them.

05:58.858 --> 06:01.027
[Gladys] Jughead? Heh.

06:01.527 --> 06:02.487
Hey, Mom.

06:07.658 --> 06:08.493
Jug.

06:10.411 --> 06:11.662
Oh...

06:13.373 --> 06:16.250
You feel like a bag of tire irons.

06:16.793 --> 06:17.752
Are you eating?

06:19.128 --> 06:21.339
Ugh. You're not a vegetarian now, are you?

06:21.422 --> 06:23.424
-You wound me, Mother.
-[laughs]

06:25.927 --> 06:26.761
Oh. [chuckles]

06:27.970 --> 06:31.015
I recognize that rooster top.
Archie Andrews?

06:31.599 --> 06:32.725
[laughs]

06:33.643 --> 06:36.771
Oh... Gosh, you sure grew up.

06:38.356 --> 06:41.192
Oh... So...

06:41.943 --> 06:43.945
You two finally got together, huh?

06:44.529 --> 06:47.240
I always knew there was something
going on between you.

06:47.532 --> 06:48.574
[both] Uh...

06:48.825 --> 06:51.160
We're not together.
Just on the road together.

06:51.452 --> 06:53.329
Yeah, like a bromance.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.372
Sure.

06:54.455 --> 06:57.458
You didn't come to Toledo for the weather.
What's going on?

06:57.542 --> 07:00.461
Why didn't you call me,
tell me you were coming?

07:02.088 --> 07:03.923
Last time I called,
you said I couldn't come.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.009
Well, that was a different time.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.639
Hey.

07:11.722 --> 07:13.307
I got my GED now.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.977
Hmm? I started this whole place up.

07:16.352 --> 07:19.313
-I am a legit businesswoman now.
-Hey, Gladys.

07:20.189 --> 07:22.400
Tail Pipe just came in with these.
Where do you want them?

07:22.483 --> 07:24.485
Yeah, yeah, not right now, Lugnut.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.531
Oh, hey, hold up.
Get the crew together, huh?

07:28.990 --> 07:30.950
Tell them my son's come home.

07:31.033 --> 07:32.118
His best pal, too.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.872
Tonight we are going to feast.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.832
-Whoa! Yeah.
-[Gladys chuckles]

07:40.376 --> 07:42.295
[Alice] <i>Betty, you look terrible.</i>

07:42.378 --> 07:43.379
Thank you, Mom.

07:44.338 --> 07:46.466
Did you come here just to tell me that?

07:48.050 --> 07:50.052
I thought you were staying at the Farm.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.639
I am. But the school board reached out.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.808
They're having an emergency meeting.
I wanna be there.

07:55.892 --> 07:56.934
Meeting about what?

07:57.727 --> 08:00.271
Apparently there was a mass seizure
at school.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.523
Like the one that you had.

08:03.065 --> 08:05.485
Whatever caused yours spread
to the Vixens.

08:05.568 --> 08:06.569
All of them?

08:07.195 --> 08:08.237
Including Veronica?

08:08.321 --> 08:10.114
She's one of the fallen, yes.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.365
Oh, my God.

08:12.533 --> 08:13.618
Poor Vee.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.537
I'm just glad that you were here, honey.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.873
Safe with the Sisters.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.213
[Betty]
<i>We have a very special relationship.</i>

08:25.296 --> 08:29.008
He tells me secrets,
and gives me personal quests.

08:29.091 --> 08:31.928
And people are scared of him,
because he's all-powerful,

08:32.011 --> 08:33.804
but he's honestly super funny.

08:34.680 --> 08:37.016
-Who's super funny?
-Oh, hey, Ethel.

08:37.099 --> 08:38.768
I was just telling everyone about

08:38.851 --> 08:41.687
how the Gargoyle King
and I have gotten really close.

08:42.146 --> 08:43.397
Very funny, Betty.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.482
It's true.
After I met him,

08:45.650 --> 08:47.985
I couldn't get him out of my head,
you know?

08:49.237 --> 08:50.279
He's amazing.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.907
Yesterday, he said...

08:56.536 --> 08:58.538
-Never mind.
-He said what?

09:01.123 --> 09:02.416
Yesterday, he said...

09:03.626 --> 09:05.586
I was his new favorite.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.048
-[all gasping]
-That's-- That's not possible.

09:09.131 --> 09:11.133
You're not worthy enough for him.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.720
You're making all this up,
to make fun of me.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.514
Of course not, Ethel.

09:18.432 --> 09:22.436
But if you don't believe me,
you should go ask him yourself.

09:23.312 --> 09:26.399
Or you and I can go talk
to the Gargoyle King together.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.527
You do have the keys to his chamber.

09:36.158 --> 09:37.535
What, Ethel?

09:37.618 --> 09:38.661
Are you scared?

09:51.007 --> 09:53.509
-What are you doing? Open the door.
-I can't, Ethel.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.596
And I'm sorry,
but I need to fast-track my plans,

09:56.679 --> 09:58.431
and you're my best shot
at converting someone.

09:58.514 --> 10:00.349
You'll make him angry.
You're disrespecting him.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.352
The Gargoyle King isn't real, Ethel.
He's a hallucination.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.521
The candy the Sisters give us,

10:05.855 --> 10:06.689
it's a drug.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.816
-It's making you see things.
-Stop it.

10:08.899 --> 10:09.984
Stop lying.

10:10.067 --> 10:13.070
Once the drug wears off in a few hours,
you'll see, okay?

10:14.030 --> 10:15.114
You'll see the truth.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.372
[screaming]

10:31.255 --> 10:32.089
Ethel.

10:32.923 --> 10:33.924
I'm back.
Are you okay?

10:39.221 --> 10:40.681
[sobbing] I don't understand.

10:44.393 --> 10:45.936
It's just a statue.

10:47.605 --> 10:48.773
But I saw him.

10:55.780 --> 10:56.739
We all did.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.743
Because we were high on Fizzle Rocks.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.663
The Sisters feed us drugs

11:04.163 --> 11:07.541
that make us susceptible
to visions that they suggest.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.335
They let us play the game,

11:09.418 --> 11:12.129
and then they use our delusions
of the Gargoyle King

11:12.213 --> 11:14.382
to scare us into submission.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.592
-It can't be.
-It is.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.720
The Sisters are running some kind of scam,

11:19.970 --> 11:21.180
with Hiram Lodge.

11:21.889 --> 11:25.351
I think he's paying them
to test his drugs on the patients.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.978
But I've seen him in real life.

11:28.396 --> 11:29.689
In my hospital room.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.191
The Gargoyle King, he--

11:33.526 --> 11:35.403
-He's out there.
-I know.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.656
I saw the Gargoyle King in town, too.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.908
Or someone dressed up as him.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.953
At any rate,
it doesn't change the fact that in here,

11:44.036 --> 11:45.996
he's just a hunk of cement.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.251
I can't believe it.

11:50.334 --> 11:51.627
I need your help, Ethel.

11:51.711 --> 11:55.923
Sister Woodhouse must know more about G&G
than she's letting on.

11:56.006 --> 11:58.426
This game is literally killing people.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.429
Think about Dilton and Ben.

12:02.888 --> 12:03.848
If we know more,

12:03.931 --> 12:06.892
then we can stop those things
from happening again.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.396
We just need Sister Woodhouse to fess up,

12:11.313 --> 12:15.025
before we can escape,
and shut this place down.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.819
How are we going to escape?

12:16.902 --> 12:17.945
First things first.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.531
Sister Woodhouse.

12:25.286 --> 12:28.873
[Weatherbee] <i>Attention, students,</i>
<i>we are hereby closing the student lounge.</i>

12:28.956 --> 12:31.959
-<i>Please, exit immediately.</i>
-They cancel sports and extracurriculars.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.920
Now they're shutting down the lounge.
What is going on?

12:35.296 --> 12:39.008
As student body president, please,
tell me you've got insider information.

12:39.717 --> 12:43.721
Though my powers as dauphine
of Riverdale High aren't absolute yet,

12:43.804 --> 12:47.558
I am CC'd on all school board e-mails,
and they're having a meeting tonight.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.644
I think
to discuss shutting down the school.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.814
And, Veronica,
your parents are leading the charge.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.441
Of course they are.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.818
It's exactly what my dad did
with Southside High.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.279
And he definitely
had ulterior motives then.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.530
Oh, my God.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.990
[school bell ringing]

13:03.699 --> 13:06.202
And now Riverdale High
is officially a hot zone?

13:06.285 --> 13:07.286
[all shouting]

13:11.791 --> 13:13.459
-That's one of the infected.
-Run.

13:17.505 --> 13:21.133
Drugs, gargoyles,
mystery men in hazmat suits,

13:21.217 --> 13:22.968
and secret school board meetings?

13:23.052 --> 13:24.345
How does it tie together?

13:24.929 --> 13:27.306
Not sure. But I got some suss for you.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.060
According to my sources,
the Fizzle Rocks distributors,

13:31.143 --> 13:34.104
aka the Gargoyles,
are giving their product out

13:34.188 --> 13:35.231
to people for free.

13:35.314 --> 13:38.234
I've seen enough episodes of <i>Narcos</i>
to know this scheme.

13:39.026 --> 13:42.196
Hook them with the first taste,
then they're customers for life.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.907
Daddy's always playing the long game.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.784
For sure. And here's the kicker.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.370
Fizzle Rocks are coming
from the South Side,

13:49.578 --> 13:52.206
right out of the prison
your dad's been building.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.708
Must be
where he moved his candy factory to

13:54.792 --> 13:57.086
after Cheryl, Toni, and I
busted his lab at the Whyte Wyrm.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.296
-Hmm.
-Speaking of Cheryl...

14:02.550 --> 14:03.384
Cheryl.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.554
What time is that school board meeting?

14:06.637 --> 14:07.638
And where?

14:08.138 --> 14:10.724
No child should step foot
through these doors

14:10.808 --> 14:13.269
until we have figured out what is going on

14:13.352 --> 14:15.271
in this toxic petri dish of contagion.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.690
We're taking as many precautions
as we can, Ms. Blossom.

14:17.773 --> 14:20.818
What we should be doing
is tracking down patient zero

14:20.901 --> 14:23.404
and running every test
in Western medicine on them.

14:23.487 --> 14:26.574
Tonight's discussion is regarding the fate
of Riverdale High.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.242
Can we please stay on topic?

14:28.325 --> 14:31.871
To Ms. Blossom's point,
my wife and I are in full agreement.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.706
Most parents are. I mean,

14:33.789 --> 14:36.709
five more kids experienced seizures,
just this afternoon.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.502
Isn't that right, Waldo?

14:40.337 --> 14:42.840
-Yeah.
-Which is why tonight,

14:42.923 --> 14:45.593
as mayor, I am signing an executive order

14:45.676 --> 14:48.762
shutting down Riverdale High,
at least until it's deemed safe.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.097
Stop it right there.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.976
-CDC hasn't set foot in Riverdale High.
-Fact.

14:54.059 --> 14:57.062
Now my parents are bullying you all
into closing it.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.649
Sounds exactly like what you did
with Southside High,

15:00.733 --> 15:02.610
which you now use as a drug factory.

15:02.693 --> 15:06.071
I thought Southside High property
was being developed into a prison.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.282
That's just his cover, Ms. Cooper.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.618
Is that your plan here, too, Daddy?

15:10.701 --> 15:14.121
Trump up a way to get another huge parcel
of land on the cheap,

15:14.747 --> 15:16.916
then expand your ever-growing drug empire,

15:17.207 --> 15:20.544
which now consists
almost exclusively of Fizzle Rocks?

15:20.628 --> 15:23.088
Veronica, what are you even talking about?

15:23.172 --> 15:26.550
That's okay, <i>mi amor.</i>
There's a reason for this meeting, right?

15:27.009 --> 15:28.218
To air our concerns.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.179
We called the CDC.

15:30.804 --> 15:32.431
They wouldn't send anyone

15:32.514 --> 15:34.683
to investigate such a low-priority crisis.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.477
They think it's all psychological.

15:36.644 --> 15:40.105
So, we took some initiative.
The men you saw in hazmat gear,

15:40.189 --> 15:43.692
they were hired from a private firm
to run exhaustive tests.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.445
And Southside High is becoming a prison,

15:46.528 --> 15:48.072
not a drug factory.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.616
If you'd like the name
of the guards we recently hired,

15:50.699 --> 15:52.076
I'd happily provide a list.

15:54.536 --> 15:55.788
Have I left anything out?

15:59.124 --> 16:00.417
Yes, you have.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.796
The part about how you're
producing Fizzle Rocks

16:03.879 --> 16:07.800
and giving it away for free,
to get every teenager in Riverdale hooked.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.178
And I suppose I'm also the Gargoyle King.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.764
As Jughead Jones accused me of being.

16:14.807 --> 16:15.933
Poor, deluded girl.

16:16.475 --> 16:19.728
I hear tell that
these seizures cause hallucinations,

16:19.812 --> 16:21.063
and...

16:21.146 --> 16:23.065
isn't this child one of the afflicted?

16:23.524 --> 16:25.943
On that note, where are the cheerleaders?

16:26.568 --> 16:29.530
I speak for the disappeared Vixens.
What of them?

16:30.030 --> 16:34.118
-Where were they taken, and by whom?
-Those girls went to Riverdale General.

16:34.201 --> 16:36.662
They're receiving
the best medical care possible.

16:36.745 --> 16:38.998
And being dissected like fetal pigs,
no doubt.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.750
You messed with my squad,
you messed with me.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.128
Now I demand real answers.

16:47.506 --> 16:48.382
What?

16:49.299 --> 16:50.300
What, you viper?

16:50.384 --> 16:51.427
[gasping]

17:02.187 --> 17:03.856
[Gladys] Hiram Lodge, huh?

17:03.939 --> 17:06.233
That good-looking short stack
was always trouble.

17:06.316 --> 17:07.860
But why go after Archie?

17:10.821 --> 17:13.073
Archie stood up to him, defied him.

17:13.323 --> 17:14.867
Not to mention, I also date--

17:15.868 --> 17:17.202
Dated his daughter.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.370
[groans, then chuckles]

17:18.454 --> 17:20.914
Dated? As in, no longer dating?

17:20.998 --> 17:22.708
-As in single?
-Relax, Jellybean.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.835
It's JB now, Kid Kerouac.

17:24.918 --> 17:26.670
-[scoffs]
-[Gladys] Archie...

17:27.546 --> 17:29.256
have you spoken to your dad through this?

17:31.383 --> 17:32.634
I wish. I wish I could...

17:34.136 --> 17:34.970
see him...

17:36.263 --> 17:38.182
tell him how I am, but it's too risky.

17:38.265 --> 17:41.643
He'd drag me home by the collar.
Riverdale's not where I need to be.

17:44.354 --> 17:47.232
-Pig's ready.
-[Gladys] All right, you heard the guy.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.610
Archie, go get yourself a hot meal.

17:49.693 --> 17:51.028
Cheek's the best part.

17:51.111 --> 17:54.156
[boy] Go ahead and light it up.
Get it while it's hot.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.368
All right, so...

17:59.078 --> 18:03.082
tell me about this game thing,
that you and Archie are mixed up in.

18:03.165 --> 18:06.376
Gryphons and Gargoyles.
How involved with this are you?

18:06.460 --> 18:07.669
It's more than a game.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.297
It has larger implications for Riverdale.

18:10.380 --> 18:14.384
I'm trying to crack it, get underneath it,
figure out who's behind all of this.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.179
Well, Hiram, it sounds like.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.141
Is he who gave you
that nasty scar on your arm?

18:21.517 --> 18:23.268
-You saw that, huh?
-Yeah, it's bad.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.561
No, that was a...

18:26.188 --> 18:28.315
gift from a former Serpent.

18:28.732 --> 18:29.983
Under Hiram's employ.

18:31.026 --> 18:32.736
-Penny Peabody.
-Penny?

18:33.153 --> 18:36.365
That wench? She always had a beef
about your father and I.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.242
Now she does this? Cuts up my son?

18:38.617 --> 18:41.036
You know,
I never wanted this for you, kid.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.373
I mean, you're a Serpent King?
I never wanted you in the damn gang.

18:44.456 --> 18:45.290
Don't...

18:45.958 --> 18:48.377
act all high and mighty.
I saw that kid with the stereos earlier.

18:52.422 --> 18:55.008
You claim to have left Riverdale
to get away from Serpent life,

18:55.092 --> 18:57.719
and here you are,
chopping cars, lifting their parts.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.763
-God knows what else.
-Hey.

19:00.430 --> 19:01.306
So what?

19:01.390 --> 19:05.519
We jack a couple stereos here and there,
and we steal some hubcaps.

19:05.602 --> 19:07.855
I am feeding and taking care
of all these kids

19:07.938 --> 19:09.356
who have nowhere else to go.

19:09.523 --> 19:11.608
Am I supposed to leave them high and dry?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.485
That's what you did to me.

19:15.195 --> 19:16.029
[sighs]

19:18.532 --> 19:21.785
Come on, let's get something to eat,
before there's nothing left.

19:36.216 --> 19:37.801
Surprised to see me, Red?

19:39.720 --> 19:41.221
There's a bounty on your head,

19:41.305 --> 19:45.309
and you left more breadcrumbs coming here
than a chubby kid in a fairytale.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.519
All right, keep quiet,

19:47.728 --> 19:49.980
I'll give you the luxury
of an open casket.

19:50.230 --> 19:52.357
[Jellybean] Not if I put you in one first.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.114
Drop the butter knife, bitch.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.950
Careful, kid, you might poke your eye out.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.965
You know, Penny, I'm not shocked
that a bottom-feeder like you

20:17.049 --> 20:18.717
is working with Hiram Lodge.

20:19.301 --> 20:22.512
I mean,
you always had unfixed allegiances.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.723
[chuckles] That's rich.

20:24.806 --> 20:26.767
Coming from Gladys Jones.

20:26.850 --> 20:27.935
Yeah, well...

20:28.018 --> 20:31.188
I am surprised that you're
not ratting him out right now.

20:31.355 --> 20:34.441
He must have something real good on you,
Penny Slot.

20:35.150 --> 20:36.318
I'm no snitch.

20:36.944 --> 20:38.487
But I will say this.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.405
Hiram won't stop.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.825
Not till he gets what he wants.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.327
And right now that's Red.

20:45.786 --> 20:49.790
And there's nothing that you,
or your little <i>Lord of the Flies</i> crew,

20:49.873 --> 20:51.667
or Jughead here can do.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.545
Hiram won't stop.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.172
Speaking of my Jug,

20:58.632 --> 21:00.676
I saw the work that you did on him.

21:01.385 --> 21:04.304
You carved him up like a Sunday roast.

21:05.055 --> 21:08.350
-That was business between me and him.
-Yeah, well, I'm his mama.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.519
So, it's between me and you now.

21:18.068 --> 21:19.236
All right, everyone.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.196
Go inside.

21:22.823 --> 21:25.284
Me and Penny are
gonna have us a little girl talk.

21:25.617 --> 21:26.827
Ask her about G&G.

21:28.078 --> 21:29.454
How Hiram fits into it all.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.540
Roger that.

21:37.546 --> 21:38.839
I wanted to commend you.

21:39.923 --> 21:42.050
The gusto you showed in that meeting.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.219
That was audacious.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.180
-Congratulations.
-On what?

21:48.015 --> 21:48.849
On being right.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.810
About all of it.
Well, at least most of it.

21:52.769 --> 21:55.397
It's so much bigger
than you're giving me credit for.

21:56.023 --> 21:58.108
This plan, what's coming next,

21:58.191 --> 22:00.527
it's practically... biblical.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.655
-Years in the making.
-What is it?

22:03.739 --> 22:04.948
[chuckles]

22:05.699 --> 22:08.660
-What do you really want, Daddy?
-What every king wants.

22:09.828 --> 22:10.871
A kingdom.

22:11.955 --> 22:13.290
And a legacy.

22:13.790 --> 22:15.709
You know, once things are in place,

22:16.835 --> 22:18.503
I'm hoping you'll join me.

22:18.879 --> 22:22.257
Take a seat at my right hand,
help oversee the new order.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.263
You're deluded, Daddy.

22:29.806 --> 22:32.559
Also, you're not untouchable.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.228
Maybe in Riverdale you are.

22:35.937 --> 22:39.232
Because your wife's mayor,
and there's no sheriff.

22:40.484 --> 22:43.111
But there's a whole wide world out there.

22:44.488 --> 22:45.864
They'll see what you're doing.

22:47.741 --> 22:49.743
Yeah, I'm not too concerned about that.

22:51.620 --> 22:54.289
It's been a while
since I've seen you in pearls.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.793
Maybe you'll start wearing them again.

23:00.837 --> 23:01.880
Hey.

23:02.672 --> 23:04.383
-What happened with Penny?
-Just...

23:04.925 --> 23:06.510
give me a second, Jug, okay?

23:06.593 --> 23:08.553
Let me think. I just need to think.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.973
-She talk about the game?
-Jug, come on.

23:12.808 --> 23:16.853
We know she was tracking Archie for Hiram.
Was it a quest from her master?

23:16.937 --> 23:19.314
Is Hiram more than the Man in Black?
Is he the Gargoyle King?

23:19.398 --> 23:21.983
You are so caught up in this damn game,

23:22.067 --> 23:24.444
you can't see three feet in front of you.

23:25.112 --> 23:27.823
The big prize isn't Archie's head,

23:28.365 --> 23:30.867
it is Riverdale, Jug.

23:31.243 --> 23:34.454
If you had your wits about you,
you would realize that Hiram

23:34.704 --> 23:37.499
chased you out of town
to get you off the chess board.

23:37.874 --> 23:40.961
So you were far from Riverdale
when he made his big play.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.381
It's not about ascending to the kingdom.

23:45.590 --> 23:49.010
It's about claiming the kingdom.
And if Hiram is the Gargoyle King,

23:49.594 --> 23:52.806
then he's responsible
for reintroducing G&G to Riverdale,

23:52.889 --> 23:55.642
-and the deaths of those kids--
-Mrs. J, what do we do?

23:56.101 --> 23:57.853
I'm trying to figure that out.

23:59.980 --> 24:00.981
Are we okay here?

24:02.691 --> 24:04.609
-I mean, is Archie even safe?
-Yeah.

24:05.777 --> 24:06.778
Of course he is.

24:13.201 --> 24:14.744
[phone ringing]

24:16.621 --> 24:17.831
-Hello?
-[Betty] Vee?

24:18.623 --> 24:20.834
It's Betty.
It's so good to hear your voice.

24:20.917 --> 24:23.253
-Girl, where are you?
-<i>It's a long story.</i>

24:23.336 --> 24:25.755
-But I'm at the Sisters of Quiet Mercy.
-<i>What?</i>

24:25.839 --> 24:28.133
-We thought you were at the Farm.
-<i>Veronica?</i>

24:28.675 --> 24:31.928
There's not much time.
You need to listen to me very carefully.

24:32.637 --> 24:35.348
-[Cheryl] Your text said you had news?
-Betty called.

24:35.432 --> 24:38.310
-She's at the Sisters of Quiet Mercy.
-What?

24:39.853 --> 24:41.897
The hellmouth of Riverdale.
We have to break her out.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.733
Betty's working on that.
You and I have another mission.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.401
-[sighs]
-According to Bee,

24:46.485 --> 24:50.030
my father tests Fizzle Rocks on patients
at the Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

24:50.113 --> 24:52.741
Moreover,
she saw your Uncle Claudius with him,

24:53.200 --> 24:55.869
using Blossom Maple trucks
to deliver the drugs.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.913
Shades of the Legion of Doom.

24:57.996 --> 25:01.917
They're planning something big, Cheryl.
My father likened it to the apocalypse.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.251
For all we know,

25:03.335 --> 25:06.129
my father may somehow be responsible
for the seizures.

25:06.213 --> 25:08.131
But he wouldn't be any more specific.

25:08.965 --> 25:12.427
So, maybe we could ask your mom,
since she's in cahoots with him.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.180
With pleasure, Veronica.

25:15.597 --> 25:18.266
My Vixens have fallen.
My Tee-Tee has fallen.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.561
If my gorgon-like mother has any knowledge
of how or why that's happening,

25:22.187 --> 25:23.230
we'll get it out of her.

25:31.613 --> 25:35.242
Hi, Sister? Sorry, I was wondering
if I could get some more Fizzle Rocks.

25:39.454 --> 25:41.706
Don't scream, Sister.

25:42.415 --> 25:44.334
-Oh, sorry.
-You're coming with me.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.630
It's time we pay a little visit
to your king.

26:05.855 --> 26:08.817
Shh. It's just me. Get up.

26:10.610 --> 26:13.280
I didn't wanna talk
in front of Archie and the others.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.448
As it turns out,

26:16.116 --> 26:17.492
Peabody had a lot to say.

26:18.535 --> 26:21.913
The bounty on your pal Archie,
it's not just on him.

26:23.373 --> 26:25.375
It's on anyone who was with him,

26:25.875 --> 26:27.043
or is helping him.

26:27.335 --> 26:30.505
Which means there is a target
on your back now, too, Jughead.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.924
Same if he goes back to Riverdale.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.051
Archie's dad, Archie's friends.

26:35.135 --> 26:38.346
Everyone is at risk,
which is why you gotta cut him loose.

26:38.430 --> 26:41.808
I'm not just going to ditch Archie, Mom.
He's my best friend.

26:42.309 --> 26:43.476
Your mom's right, Jug.

26:46.980 --> 26:47.981
You got me this far.

26:49.232 --> 26:51.735
More than anyone else would do.
You can go home.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.571
What are you saying?
You can't go out there alone.

26:54.654 --> 26:58.867
Jug, Hiram almost killed us at that farm.
Penny tracked us here to your mom's.

26:58.950 --> 27:02.537
I put her in danger, Jellybean in danger.
I can't keep doing that.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.081
Wherever I go next...

27:06.291 --> 27:07.626
-has to be alone.
-Archie--

27:07.709 --> 27:08.752
Jug.

27:17.218 --> 27:18.219
[Gladys] All right.
So, it's decided.

27:21.681 --> 27:24.017
We'll get you a ride to the border,
I know a guy who'll help.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.770
Jughead, you can stay here
as long as you want.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.483
No, I need to go home.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.612
Hiram Lodge needs to get taken down.

27:36.154 --> 27:38.323
It's only gonna happen from the inside.

27:41.368 --> 27:42.911
[Woodhouse] You sinful girls.

27:42.994 --> 27:47.082
I will strap you to your beds,
and electroshock the sin out of you.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.501
Sister...

27:50.210 --> 27:53.004
monsters don't scare me,
and neither do you.
I've seen real darkness,
stared it right in the face.

27:55.965 --> 27:59.594
That's why you couldn't break me.
I know the scam that you're running.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.388
I saw you with Hiram Lodge.

28:01.471 --> 28:04.766
You're testing his drugs out on patients.
Why?

28:05.892 --> 28:09.688
-Mr. Lodge is a generous donor.
-Oh.

28:09.771 --> 28:12.565
-A believer in our mission.
-By "mission," you mean...?

28:12.649 --> 28:16.069
Using the game,
and the Gargoyle King, to scare girls?

28:17.195 --> 28:18.154
Torture children?

28:18.613 --> 28:21.324
The children
who come through our doors are broken.

28:22.117 --> 28:26.246
It's our sacred mission to fix them,
using whatever tools necessary.

28:26.746 --> 28:30.834
Does that mean that the Sisters created
Gryphons and Gargoyles?

28:31.334 --> 28:32.502
As a tool?

28:35.380 --> 28:40.385
Misbehaving children have been brought
down to this room since the asylum opened.

28:41.094 --> 28:43.304
That statue scared them into submission.

28:44.097 --> 28:46.725
Some of them, the more disturbed ones,
created a fantasy realm, a game.

28:50.270 --> 28:52.522
To cope with the fear
of the one they named...

28:53.857 --> 28:55.066
the Gargoyle King.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.320
We embraced it as a therapeutic tool.

28:59.946 --> 29:01.156
And it worked,

29:01.239 --> 29:04.159
because it embeds itself
in the minds of the players.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.370
It makes them complacent, focuses them.

29:07.454 --> 29:08.455
If that's true,

29:08.538 --> 29:10.957
then how did the game get out
into the world?

29:11.040 --> 29:14.711
-Did you give it to Hiram?
-It was never meant to leave these walls.

29:14.794 --> 29:16.212
It's too powerful.

29:16.671 --> 29:18.757
A game born of madness.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.467
A madness you helped nurture.

29:21.509 --> 29:23.595
Now people like Ben and Dilton are dead.

29:23.678 --> 29:26.765
You're gonna pay for everything
that you've done, Sister.

29:27.056 --> 29:29.017
And you're gonna tell the authorities

29:29.100 --> 29:30.935
what you've told us about the game,

29:31.811 --> 29:33.855
and about Hiram's donations.

29:35.648 --> 29:39.068
I only answer to one authority, Betty.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.405
[Betty] Come on, Ethel. We have her keys.

29:42.489 --> 29:43.656
We're leaving.

29:44.199 --> 29:47.952
-We're taking your children with us.
-They won't wanna leave.

29:49.078 --> 29:50.163
We'll see about that.

29:54.918 --> 29:55.877
[Woodhouse] Help!
Help!

29:57.754 --> 29:59.380
I'm in the basement!

30:00.590 --> 30:01.591
Help!

30:01.674 --> 30:02.926
[gasping]

30:04.135 --> 30:05.261
Let's do this again.

30:06.596 --> 30:09.516
What does my father have planned
for Riverdale?

30:09.599 --> 30:11.559
Speak, or it gets the syrup again.

30:12.185 --> 30:13.228
[panting]

30:13.311 --> 30:14.646
Fine, you wanna know...
your father's plans?

30:17.649 --> 30:21.528
He's finally gonna turn this backwater
into something worthwhile.

30:22.111 --> 30:24.697
A place where we can all pursue

30:25.031 --> 30:26.699
our various enterprises...

30:27.367 --> 30:29.369
-unmolested.
-What does that mean?

30:29.452 --> 30:32.330
She's talking about drug dealing
and prostitution.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.707
Aren't you? You ghoul-lunatic.

30:42.173 --> 30:43.550
We need specifics.

30:45.051 --> 30:50.139
How exactly is my father planning
on turning Riverdale into Vice City?

30:50.223 --> 30:52.934
Well, he's in bed with the mayor,
isn't he?

30:53.935 --> 30:57.647
And as for law enforcement,
well, the last time I checked,

30:58.690 --> 31:00.692
Riverdale didn't have much of a sheriff.

31:01.693 --> 31:02.610
[chuckles]

31:02.694 --> 31:05.530
Details, or so help me God,

31:05.613 --> 31:07.782
I will drown you in this cheap crap.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.076
And open the garden doors
to let the ants in.

31:10.159 --> 31:10.994
[gasps]

31:11.911 --> 31:13.872
[Penelope] All right, I'll tell you.

31:15.206 --> 31:17.500
What do you mean,
you don't want to escape?

31:18.042 --> 31:19.127
I feel safe here.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.838
We play G&G, the Sisters give us candy,

31:21.921 --> 31:23.715
keep us warm and clean.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.466
Why would we wanna leave?

31:29.929 --> 31:31.306
Sister Woodhouse was right.

31:31.389 --> 31:33.474
They're all brainwashed, just like I was.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.978
Well, we can't just leave them behind.
Not to mention all those kids

31:37.061 --> 31:38.938
in the gay conversion wing,
where Cheryl was.

31:39.022 --> 31:41.482
There has to be something we can do.

31:43.109 --> 31:43.943
Wait, the game.

31:45.445 --> 31:48.656
The game is how they cope with terror,
right?

31:48.740 --> 31:52.076
So, let's convince them to escape
by turning it into a quest.

31:53.161 --> 31:55.496
The Gargoyle King inspires fear.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.832
So, let's give them hope.

31:58.041 --> 32:00.209
Give them the opposite
of the Gargoyle King,

32:00.293 --> 32:01.878
-which is--
-The Gryphon Queen.

32:10.136 --> 32:11.137
All right.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.557
Well, I packed you guys some lunches
for the road.

32:14.974 --> 32:16.017
[knocking on door]

32:16.559 --> 32:19.228
Jug, mind getting that?
It's probably Archie's ride.

32:28.154 --> 32:29.155
Dad.

32:31.032 --> 32:32.492
I missed you so much, Dad.

32:33.242 --> 32:34.327
Me, too, son.

32:46.589 --> 32:48.132
So, you finally made it, huh?

32:48.841 --> 32:51.427
Jughead's getting his bag.
He'll be out in a minute.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.304
Hey, Jellybelly.

32:54.389 --> 32:55.390
She's gotten so big.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.185
Can I get a hug?

32:59.727 --> 33:01.896
-Can I get a dad?
-Hey, JB.

33:02.605 --> 33:05.024
-Come on, now.
-Let her be. I deserve that.

33:06.526 --> 33:07.568
She misses you.

33:07.652 --> 33:10.530
-[chuckles]
-She'd just rather fight than admit it.

33:10.613 --> 33:12.573
Yeah, like mother, like daughter.

33:12.657 --> 33:13.491
[Jughead] Dad?

33:14.450 --> 33:15.743
I see Mom called you.

33:17.495 --> 33:19.205
Thought you might be missing this.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.337
I heard Penny was here causing trouble.

33:26.421 --> 33:27.755
No problem at all.

33:28.631 --> 33:31.300
We don't have
to worry much about Penny anymore.

33:35.722 --> 33:36.723
Come here, kid.
I'm gonna miss you.

33:43.479 --> 33:45.982
Go, uh-- Go warm up the bikes,
will you, Jug?

33:48.818 --> 33:50.445
Thank you, Gladys, for the call.

33:51.779 --> 33:53.614
I'll make sure he gets home safe.

34:02.498 --> 34:03.499
Get out of here.

34:09.464 --> 34:10.757
[Veronica] <i>Kevin, cadets.</i>

34:13.468 --> 34:14.802
This meal's on the house.

34:15.428 --> 34:18.723
But you brutes are helping us.
We need backup right the hell now.

34:18.806 --> 34:19.682
What's going on?

34:22.351 --> 34:24.228
On your feet, soldier boys.

34:24.479 --> 34:25.521
We're going to war.

34:26.314 --> 34:28.024
Paladins and Hellcasters,

34:28.983 --> 34:30.234
Healers and Deadeyes,

34:30.318 --> 34:32.528
your Game Master has a new adventure
for you.

34:33.321 --> 34:35.573
Your goal is to escape...

34:36.574 --> 34:38.284
from the Gargoyle King's fortress.

34:40.620 --> 34:43.623
But we can't.
If he catches us, we'll be punished.

34:43.706 --> 34:45.708
Yes, severely.

34:46.167 --> 34:47.168
But there is hope.

34:47.251 --> 34:49.462
A queen to lead you into the light.

34:49.837 --> 34:51.255
Hark, there she be.

35:02.600 --> 35:03.601
Follow me,

35:04.268 --> 35:05.853
your Gryphon Queen,

35:06.896 --> 35:10.483
away from this fortress
and back to the Kingdom of Eldervair.

35:10.566 --> 35:11.818
But what about the King?

35:16.280 --> 35:17.281
The King...
is dead.

35:19.826 --> 35:21.619
You are all free.

35:22.703 --> 35:24.497
-[all shouting]
-[Ethel] Shh, shh, shh.

35:25.623 --> 35:27.333
We can't wake the King's demon soldiers.

35:27.875 --> 35:31.003
I have the enchanted keys.
Meet me at the doors to freedom.

36:15.089 --> 36:16.007
Here you go.

36:16.924 --> 36:19.177
It's the, uh, last stop before the border.

36:20.136 --> 36:22.471
-Yeah.
-You know, I was thinking, you know,

36:22.555 --> 36:25.141
I could go with you,
we could do this together.

36:25.224 --> 36:26.559
Find a cabin in the woods?

36:26.642 --> 36:29.270
Yeah, teach you carpentry,
like my old man did me.

36:29.729 --> 36:30.688
Imagine that.

36:31.355 --> 36:32.190
Us,

36:33.149 --> 36:34.984
living off the land, father and son.

36:35.067 --> 36:36.319
Hunting, fishing.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.279
It'd be great.

36:38.779 --> 36:39.947
Yeah, it would be.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.117
But, uh...

36:43.993 --> 36:45.453
you know we can't do that.

36:45.953 --> 36:46.954
Right, Dad?

36:49.707 --> 36:50.958
I can't change your mind?

36:51.751 --> 36:53.461
Get you to come back home?

36:58.549 --> 37:00.551
But you can give me your blessing.

37:04.263 --> 37:07.391
I was your age when my father died.
I never said goodbye--

37:07.475 --> 37:08.726
This isn't goodbye, Dad.

37:11.270 --> 37:12.855
You're damn right it's not.

37:17.568 --> 37:18.569
See you soon?
Yeah.

37:20.321 --> 37:21.322
You will.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.325
Oh, uh... One more thing.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.041
Vegas.

37:35.628 --> 37:36.754
[Vegas whimpering]

38:00.820 --> 38:01.862
Mom. Stop.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.239
You heard the woman. Halt.

38:06.242 --> 38:07.493
Veronica, what is this?

38:07.576 --> 38:10.329
Consider it a <i>coup de moi.</i>
We know your endgame.

38:10.413 --> 38:13.040
And you are hereby relieved
of your mayoral duties.

38:13.124 --> 38:17.086
Those plans you and your husband have
with my dolly-mop mother are now canceled.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.089
Now step away from the phone,

38:20.756 --> 38:23.843
before you make the biggest mistake
of your life.

38:25.428 --> 38:26.429
Veronica...

38:27.805 --> 38:29.932
you can't just walk in here and depose me.

38:30.683 --> 38:32.101
I'm an elected official.

38:34.437 --> 38:35.438
Besides...
you're too late.

38:39.275 --> 38:41.027
The order went out ten minutes ago.

38:41.777 --> 38:43.571
I was about to call and tell you.

38:43.863 --> 38:45.656
[cell phones beeping]

38:50.870 --> 38:52.580
[sirens wailing nearby]

38:54.123 --> 38:55.333
It's starting.

39:00.629 --> 39:03.007
Betty, what are we gonna do
with all these kids?

39:03.090 --> 39:04.300
They have nowhere to go.

39:04.675 --> 39:06.510
We'll help them, Ethel. All of them.

39:09.722 --> 39:10.890
-Mom?
-Betty.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.436
Why are you wearing that outfit?
What's going on?

39:15.519 --> 39:17.730
-Why are you here?
-[Alice] Hell is breaking loose.

39:17.813 --> 39:19.440
I came to get you out of the Sisters.

39:20.399 --> 39:23.986
Well, you're just in time,
but it's not just gonna be me.

39:25.946 --> 39:27.365
[sirens wailing nearby]

39:28.366 --> 39:31.077
[Jughead] <i>And just like that,</i>
<i>in a few frantic moments,</i>

39:31.160 --> 39:33.037
<i>the town we'd known all our lives</i>

39:33.120 --> 39:35.331
<i>was once again changed,</i>

39:35.831 --> 39:37.875
<i>but this time, irrevocably.</i>

39:38.959 --> 39:41.879
<i>It was time for us</i>
<i>to brace for a terrible impact.</i>

39:43.464 --> 39:47.259
<i>And while Archie Andrews headed away</i>
<i>from the doomed town of Riverdale,</i>

39:47.343 --> 39:49.178
<i>we raced towards it.</i>

39:49.387 --> 39:51.597
<i>For that night was the fruition of a game</i>

39:51.680 --> 39:55.434
<i>that had been planned for</i>
<i>and played across the years.</i>

40:03.984 --> 40:06.237
-The hell is this?
-Town's under quarantine.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.948
Governor's orders. No one in or out.
Turn around, go.

40:09.281 --> 40:10.491
No, no, we live here.

40:10.574 --> 40:12.785
-Not anymore. Turn around. Now.
-[guns cocking]

40:17.415 --> 40:19.667
[Dooley, over phone] <i>Well, Hiram,</i>
<i>you got what you wanted.</i>

40:19.750 --> 40:21.460
<i>The town's quarantined.</i>

40:21.544 --> 40:24.171
<i>I'll do what I can</i>
<i>to keep the outside world at bay.</i>

40:24.255 --> 40:26.257
Riverdale thanks you, Governor Dooley.

40:26.590 --> 40:29.009
-You did the right thing.
-<i>I pray that's true.</i>

40:29.343 --> 40:31.595
<i>And may God have mercy on our souls.</i>

40:32.638 --> 40:33.722
Not God, Governor.

40:34.390 --> 40:35.349
The King.
