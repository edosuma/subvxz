<i>Previously, on</i>
"Hawaii Five-O"...

00:01.634 --> 00:03.047
<i>His hacker handle is
"Toast."</i>

00:03.134 --> 00:05.906
He's really a-a genius,
42 minutes of the day.

00:05.994 --> 00:07.137
What about the rest
of the time?

00:07.224 --> 00:08.691
Baked like a potato.

00:08.779 --> 00:10.207
Uh-huh.<i> Pakalolo.</i>

00:10.295 --> 00:12.223
- Can I smoke in here, guys?
- No. - No.

00:12.311 --> 00:13.871
Huh, look at that.
It's Toast.

00:13.959 --> 00:15.449
Hey, yo, Toast, what's up, man?

00:15.537 --> 00:18.545
- Please! Please! Please!
- You're not talking much now, are you?

00:19.772 --> 00:22.174
Hey, hey, Jerry, listen,
McGarrett is on a phone call

00:22.262 --> 00:23.657
from Toast...

00:24.554 --> 00:26.723
What if Wright stole
that CI list

00:26.811 --> 00:28.481
the first time
he breached the system?

00:28.569 --> 00:30.285
What, like
an insurance policy?

00:30.373 --> 00:32.069
Exactly like
an insurance policy.

00:32.156 --> 00:34.240
Now we find ourselves
with no other option

00:34.328 --> 00:35.468
but to go to
Wright for help.

00:35.601 --> 00:37.015
So you want me
to figure out who accessed

00:37.102 --> 00:38.404
your server and
smoked your CI.

00:38.516 --> 00:40.170
His name was Toast.

00:40.535 --> 00:42.162
Unfortunately, now, he's...

00:42.250 --> 00:43.353
Toast?

00:43.456 --> 00:45.212
I'm sorry.
Was that too soon?

00:45.300 --> 00:47.852
You're the last person
we wanted to see,

00:47.970 --> 00:50.310
but you breached
our system successfully,

00:50.500 --> 00:52.256
which makes you the expert,
you understand?

00:52.344 --> 00:53.533
How much longer?

00:53.667 --> 00:55.178
Won't be long now.

01:01.619 --> 01:02.912
Don't.

01:12.324 --> 01:15.858
Okay. Excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

01:16.256 --> 01:18.708
Sorry, sorry, there...

01:29.457 --> 01:31.200
Wait, wait, wait,
could you hold it please?

01:31.288 --> 01:32.202
Yes.

01:32.290 --> 01:33.613
Would you hit 16 for us?

01:33.701 --> 01:35.675
16, sure. You got it.

01:35.935 --> 01:37.443
Thank you.

01:38.390 --> 01:39.847
How you guys
doing today?

01:40.240 --> 01:42.399
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Morning.

01:44.232 --> 01:45.339
Java time.

01:45.427 --> 01:46.966
Get it while
it's hot.

01:47.638 --> 01:49.568
- Hey, hey.
- There you are.

01:49.724 --> 01:50.792
Thank you.

01:50.880 --> 01:52.004
Mmm.

01:52.092 --> 01:53.301
Cheers.

01:54.604 --> 01:56.782
Drew, dude,
why is it when

01:56.870 --> 01:58.752
it's your turn to pick up
the coffee, it's always late?

01:58.839 --> 02:00.284
Because
I'm a good person, Tim.

02:00.378 --> 02:02.503
I take the time to talk
to people, unlike you,

02:02.591 --> 02:04.690
who's a socially inept
misanthrope.

02:36.932 --> 02:39.056
Sir, there are
only four bodies here.

02:39.144 --> 02:41.636
The guy from the elevator,
where is he?

It's delicious. Okay.

03:29.545 --> 03:30.733
Now try this one.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.413
Percy.

03:38.583 --> 03:41.605
Okay, do you want
my honest opinion?

03:41.693 --> 03:43.933
- Yeah.
- I don't taste a damn bit of difference

03:44.021 --> 03:45.177
between either one of these.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.403
Exactly.

03:47.434 --> 03:48.997
Am I missing something?

03:49.085 --> 03:51.137
I've been hearing about
this place on the North Shore

03:51.224 --> 03:54.966
selling kouign-amann, not your
average, run of the mill pastry.

03:55.372 --> 03:58.347
So, this morning, I get one
of the guys from the kitchen

03:58.435 --> 04:00.012
and run around there
and pick up one for me.

04:00.099 --> 04:01.648
You know, I want
to check out my competition.

04:01.735 --> 04:02.654
Okay.

04:02.741 --> 04:03.738
Turns out

04:03.825 --> 04:07.872
my competition... is me.

04:08.169 --> 04:10.177
Wait, so one of these is...

04:10.265 --> 04:11.363
Yeah.

04:11.451 --> 04:13.537
Oh, wow.

04:14.037 --> 04:16.625
That's pretty good, then.
Must've figured out your recipe.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.762
So by "figured out,"
you mean "ripped off"?

04:18.896 --> 04:20.685
That's cold, P.

04:21.208 --> 04:23.880
All right, well, what do you
want me to do about it?

04:23.997 --> 04:26.638
I've been robbed, Officer.
What you gonna do about it?

04:26.779 --> 04:28.233
All right, first of all,
I'm a captain.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.326
Whatever, man.

04:29.414 --> 04:31.495
Look, second
of all, Percy,

04:31.583 --> 04:33.685
copying somebody's recipe
is dishonest, okay?

04:33.775 --> 04:36.978
I'd-I'd even go as far as to say
it's-it's unethical,

04:37.065 --> 04:39.398
but illegal?
Percy.

04:39.651 --> 04:41.823
You'll have a hard time
proving that.

04:42.034 --> 04:43.555
You're my brother
and I love you

04:43.643 --> 04:45.125
and I'd love
to help you, but, um,

04:45.213 --> 04:47.000
I don't really think
there's much I can do,

04:47.088 --> 04:49.602
and I'm late, okay?
I got to go.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.158
Call me later, call me later.

04:51.534 --> 04:54.205
You know what? Fine.

04:54.510 --> 04:56.917
That's fine, man.
Go on, get back to work.

04:57.018 --> 04:58.385
Don't be mad.

04:58.534 --> 05:00.180
Yeah? Well, it ain't like Five-O

05:00.268 --> 05:01.211
ain't got enough manpower

05:01.299 --> 05:02.673
to handle things
for a couple of hours,

05:02.760 --> 05:04.034
especially today,

05:04.122 --> 05:06.704
- when your brother needs you.
- You gonna play the brother card.

05:06.792 --> 05:08.555
Now? Come on, Percy,
I got to go to work.

05:08.650 --> 05:10.687
And never mind
all those times, man,

05:10.775 --> 05:11.786
- when I stood up for you come running.
- Oh, here we go.

05:11.873 --> 05:12.598
Home crying,

05:12.767 --> 05:15.961
"Percy, Percy,
they're calling me names."

05:16.049 --> 05:18.420
- All right, all right.
- "Percy, they keep picking on me."

05:18.508 --> 05:21.233
I will, I will help you, okay?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.023
- Just saying, brah, I'm saying...
- But, look, all right, fine,

05:23.110 --> 05:24.092
We'll ride out
there together,

05:24.180 --> 05:25.344
we'll talk to
this guy and see

05:25.432 --> 05:26.552
if he'll be
reasonable, okay?

05:26.654 --> 05:28.412
That's what I'm
talking about, bro.

05:28.500 --> 05:31.368
You walk in there, flash
your badge, bust a few heads.

05:31.455 --> 05:33.408
- You ain't busting-- What?
- You know what I'm saying?

05:33.495 --> 05:34.658
They'll think twice
about messing

05:34.745 --> 05:35.748
- with my kouign-amann again.
- All right,

05:35.835 --> 05:36.958
Slow your roll there,
Death Wish.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.918
These are bakers,
not dope dealers,

05:39.005 --> 05:40.248
and we ain't on the South Side

05:40.335 --> 05:41.878
of Chicago anymore, okay?

05:41.965 --> 05:43.143
Now, I'll take you out there,

05:43.244 --> 05:44.767
and I told you we'd get
this straightened out,

05:44.854 --> 05:46.229
but you listen to me:

05:46.367 --> 05:47.570
we're gonna do this,

05:47.658 --> 05:49.133
we're gonna do this my way.

05:49.221 --> 05:50.549
You in or you out?

05:50.640 --> 05:52.390
- All right, that's cool.
- All right.

05:52.846 --> 05:55.216
Hey, just know I got
your back, big dog.

05:55.315 --> 05:58.135
This is good. This must be
the other guy.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.766
<i>Listen, Troy, I'm flattered,</i>

06:01.854 --> 06:04.266
um, but that was
an undercover assignment.

06:04.354 --> 06:05.698
It was a one-time thing.
I'm a cop.

06:05.785 --> 06:07.351
I'm not a fitness instructor.

06:07.439 --> 06:10.948
Totally get that, but people
really love your class.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.846
They keep asking
when you're coming back.

06:12.934 --> 06:14.994
Well, of course they did.

06:15.150 --> 06:17.666
My Booty Boost routine
is off the chains.

06:17.822 --> 06:21.768
Well, if you ever want to make
a little extra cash, hit me up.

06:22.205 --> 06:24.070
Okay, yeah, thanks.
I'll keep that in mind.

06:24.158 --> 06:25.502
Shootz.

06:27.322 --> 06:30.189
Cortana, how long is it gonna
take me to get to the office?

06:30.611 --> 06:31.635
Your office

06:31.725 --> 06:33.275
is 8.7 miles.

06:33.363 --> 06:35.596
Fastest route is the H-1 East.

06:35.684 --> 06:38.635
Because of unusual traffic,
it will take you 21 minutes.

06:38.935 --> 06:40.400
Traffic sucks.

06:40.488 --> 06:41.805
I wouldn't know.

06:41.893 --> 06:43.268
I don't drive.

06:43.682 --> 06:45.447
How many days till Christmas?

06:45.588 --> 06:49.650
There are 227 days
until Christmas.

06:49.738 --> 06:51.321
Don't tell Santa
I've been naughty.

06:51.575 --> 06:53.455
It will be our secret.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.618
Hey, Joons, what's up?

06:59.705 --> 07:01.439
Yo, I just picked up
some Cocoa Puffs.

07:01.556 --> 07:03.338
If you don't get in soon,
they're gonna be all gone.

07:03.425 --> 07:05.838
Cocoa Puffs, wow.
This from a man

07:05.925 --> 07:08.048
who considers oatmeal
an indulgence.

07:08.135 --> 07:09.838
What's going on?

07:09.925 --> 07:11.675
I'm just stress eating.
Was up all night

07:11.765 --> 07:13.008
preparing for this
hearing today.

07:13.095 --> 07:14.345
How's the statement going?

07:14.435 --> 07:16.555
Uh, last count,
I was on my 15th draft.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.138
At this point,
I'm just moving words around.

07:18.225 --> 07:20.685
I'm sure whatever you're
gonna say is gonna be powerful.

07:20.775 --> 07:23.018
Yeah, let's just hope
it's powerful enough

07:23.105 --> 07:23.938
to keep this guy behind bars.

07:24.025 --> 07:26.392
Tani, I need to get
this right for Maya

07:26.625 --> 07:27.759
and for my parents.

07:27.847 --> 07:29.390
You will, you will.

07:29.478 --> 07:30.858
It's gonna be great.
I know it is.

07:30.945 --> 07:32.915
And you're gonna have
your mom and your dad there.

07:33.011 --> 07:34.119
Yeah.

07:34.910 --> 07:36.712
Hey, um, let's talk
about this at work

07:36.800 --> 07:38.294
- 'cause someone's at my door.
- Sounds good.

07:38.381 --> 07:39.939
Okay, bye.

07:53.463 --> 07:54.726
What the hell
are you doing here?

07:54.813 --> 07:56.353
Just hear me out.

07:56.496 --> 07:58.746
I don't hear well
with a gun in my face.

08:00.536 --> 08:01.660
You were saying?

08:01.748 --> 08:03.036
I need your help.

08:03.124 --> 08:04.284
You've got to be kidding me.

08:04.372 --> 08:06.505
I know how this looks,
but I saved your life once,

08:06.595 --> 08:08.746
- and I need you to return me the favor.
- Let's be clear about one thing,

08:08.833 --> 08:10.081
I don't owe you anything.

08:10.169 --> 08:11.779
Listen to me,
a bunch of guys with guns

08:11.867 --> 08:13.820
- just shot up my office.
- You have an office?

08:13.908 --> 08:15.448
That's not the key takeaway
from that sentence.

08:15.535 --> 08:17.368
The point is,
I barely escaped with my life.

08:17.455 --> 08:18.662
The other four people
that I work with,

08:18.749 --> 08:20.389
they weren't so lucky.
And the killers know

08:20.476 --> 08:22.421
that I saw their faces,
and they're gonna hunt me down

08:22.508 --> 08:24.982
till they finish
whatever it is they started.

08:26.052 --> 08:27.545
Well, then we
better get moving.

08:27.635 --> 08:29.918
I think the safest place for you
is behind bars.

08:30.091 --> 08:33.924
I don't think you understand.
This is not about my safety.

08:34.091 --> 08:36.075
This is about national security.

08:36.311 --> 08:39.591
This is about the safety
of everyone on this island.

08:46.396 --> 08:48.122
<i>Since our last tango,</i>

08:48.399 --> 08:50.128
I spent the year
seeing the world.

08:50.216 --> 08:52.700
And I settled in Singapore,
and life was pretty good.

08:52.810 --> 08:55.347
I had a beautiful Dutch
stewardess on my arm and a bar

08:55.435 --> 08:56.949
up the street that made
the best Sling in the city.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.683
And then my luck turned.

08:58.771 --> 09:00.386
U.S. Marshals
caught up with me,

09:00.474 --> 09:01.880
and I spent a few weeks
in custody,

09:01.974 --> 09:05.458
but then the darnedest thing
happened, my luck turned again.

09:05.552 --> 09:06.737
Turns out,
my skill set

09:06.825 --> 09:08.411
is highly valued
by Uncle Sam,

09:08.630 --> 09:10.288
so he offered me a job...

09:10.546 --> 09:12.500
in exchange for
full immunity, of course.

09:12.588 --> 09:14.214
And what's Uncle Sam
got you doing?

09:14.302 --> 09:16.987
I presume you're not, uh,
sweeping floors.

09:17.075 --> 09:20.503
Working for the NSA in a covert
station right here on Oahu.

09:20.591 --> 09:22.919
Like hiring Jaws
to be a lifeguard.

09:23.013 --> 09:24.318
I'm a changed man.

09:24.825 --> 09:28.308
I swear. And don't you think
I'd rather be in that office

09:28.396 --> 09:29.681
than rotting away in a cell?

09:29.768 --> 09:31.061
Now why don't you start
by telling us

09:31.148 --> 09:33.520
- what happened this morning?
- Three gunmen came in.

09:33.685 --> 09:35.851
And shot up the place.
It was...

09:36.747 --> 09:39.737
it was brutal.
I only managed to slip away

09:39.825 --> 09:41.786
because I was in the kitchen
when they showed up.

09:41.950 --> 09:43.128
Right,
I'm assuming nobody

09:43.216 --> 09:44.651
called it in because
no one knows

09:44.739 --> 09:46.480
this place even exists,
is that right?

09:46.568 --> 09:47.361
The NSA keep
everything hidden,

09:47.448 --> 09:48.701
from the existence
of their stations

09:48.788 --> 09:50.328
to the identity
of their personnel.

09:50.540 --> 09:52.859
And now their personnel
are dead because of me.

09:52.947 --> 09:54.031
What are you
talking about?

09:54.119 --> 09:56.226
It was my fault.
They came up to me in

09:56.314 --> 09:57.961
the lobby and asked me
to hold the elevator.

09:58.048 --> 10:00.626
I used my badge
to give them access.

10:01.095 --> 10:02.304
It's all my fault.

10:02.392 --> 10:04.749
Don't flatter yourself.
Those hitters would've found

10:04.837 --> 10:06.851
their way up with
or without your badge.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.853
You think the NSA's
gonna believe that?

10:09.831 --> 10:11.494
You know
what this looks like.

10:11.868 --> 10:13.367
They're gonna think
that I was involved.

10:13.454 --> 10:15.423
- That's why you came to us?
- Yeah.

10:15.571 --> 10:19.571
And I was hoping you guys could
protect me from these psychos

10:19.954 --> 10:22.149
because I saw their faces
and they saw mine.

10:22.314 --> 10:23.609
Yeah, they're
gonna be coming for you.

10:23.696 --> 10:25.586
All right, I'm gonna need you
to give Junior here the address

10:25.673 --> 10:27.180
of where the NSA's
been putting you up.

10:27.267 --> 10:29.297
All right? We're gonna put
a security detail on that place

10:29.384 --> 10:31.000
in case these hitters
come looking for you.

10:31.087 --> 10:32.509
We'll also need you
to provide us

10:32.597 --> 10:34.156
a description of them.

10:36.502 --> 10:37.882
Had to see this
for myself.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.640
I don't think we've met.
Aaron Wri...

10:41.155 --> 10:42.628
That was for a friend of mine.

10:42.859 --> 10:44.007
Toast.

10:45.523 --> 10:47.148
I guess I deserve that.

10:47.312 --> 10:48.992
Yeah, that's nowhere near
what you deserve.

10:49.585 --> 10:52.171
I knew what I was walking into
when I came here.

10:53.015 --> 10:54.598
I came anyway.

10:54.929 --> 10:56.733
Because I'm not
the only one in danger.

10:56.821 --> 10:58.561
The NSA wasn't
wasting my talents

10:58.648 --> 11:00.358
on some
garden-variety listening post.

11:00.446 --> 11:02.085
If you weren't listening,
what were you doing?

11:02.172 --> 11:04.110
Committing acts of war.

11:04.794 --> 11:06.532
Using cyber weapons

11:06.891 --> 11:08.530
to attack hostile countries.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.805
Sabotaging missile programs,
disrupting power grids.

11:12.172 --> 11:15.030
We are conducting
covert black-op campaigns

11:15.118 --> 11:17.450
against our enemies
every single day.

11:18.368 --> 11:20.641
And they're doing
the exact same thing.

11:21.688 --> 11:24.102
We are just much better at it.

11:24.336 --> 11:27.704
Our tools of the trade are some
of the most malicious code

11:27.868 --> 11:29.959
and cyber weaponry
ever developed.

11:30.047 --> 11:32.188
That's what worries me
about a hit on that office.

11:32.296 --> 11:34.161
So if the code gets
in the wrong hands...

11:34.265 --> 11:36.047
It could lead to world war.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.696
Why should we believe you?

11:37.852 --> 11:39.086
Don't.

11:42.122 --> 11:43.832
Go see for yourself.

11:45.698 --> 11:47.287
- Hey!
- Drop your weapon!

11:47.375 --> 11:48.248
Drop your weapon, now!

11:48.336 --> 11:49.709
- Five-O!
- Stand down!

11:49.797 --> 11:50.787
Stand down, stand down.

11:50.875 --> 11:52.576
- Stand down.
- All right, stand down.

11:52.664 --> 11:54.819
I'm NSA Branch Chief
Michael Flores.

11:54.907 --> 11:56.576
Lieutenant Commander
Steve McGarrett

11:56.664 --> 11:58.389
of the Five-O Task Force.

11:58.477 --> 12:00.553
This is my partner,
Officer Tani Rey.

12:00.641 --> 12:02.515
You want to tell me what
you're doing here, Commander?

12:02.602 --> 12:04.553
HPD got a call from the tenant
in this building,

12:04.641 --> 12:06.039
said they heard shots fired.

12:06.133 --> 12:07.366
Looks like they heard right.

12:07.454 --> 12:08.632
You want to tell me
what the hell's

12:08.719 --> 12:11.766
going on here,
Branch Chief Michael Flores?

12:11.969 --> 12:14.399
I'm aware of the Five-O's
standing on the island.

12:14.547 --> 12:18.657
So, as a professional courtesy,
I'm gonna fill you in.

12:19.204 --> 12:22.022
<i>This place is an NSA field
office. We got four victims,</i>

12:22.110 --> 12:24.358
all intel analysts.
Based on the casings,

12:24.446 --> 12:26.421
we got multiple shooters,
all of them well-trained.

12:26.508 --> 12:27.764
We just don't know
how many.

12:27.852 --> 12:29.561
Now, security cameras
were disabled

12:29.649 --> 12:30.584
in and outside the building

12:30.672 --> 12:31.861
in advance of the attack.

12:31.948 --> 12:34.172
You guys got any idea why
they'd choose to hit you here?

12:34.352 --> 12:35.491
Well, that's the thing.

12:35.578 --> 12:37.194
This is just a standard
listening station

12:37.282 --> 12:39.616
focused on gathering
North Korea SIGINT.

12:39.704 --> 12:41.661
We got a dozen of them
throughout the Pacific.

12:41.748 --> 12:43.389
So these guys
were just unlucky, then.

12:43.477 --> 12:44.709
Yeah.

12:45.008 --> 12:46.242
Look, I'm sure
you understand that,

12:46.329 --> 12:47.878
due to the sensitivity
of this matter,

12:47.968 --> 12:50.401
my agency is now gonna take
over this investigation.

12:50.489 --> 12:51.994
You bet. No problem.
Listen,

12:52.082 --> 12:53.482
uh, we're around.
You need anything,

12:53.575 --> 12:55.496
- you just give us a call, all right?
- Will do.

12:56.306 --> 12:59.026
Oh, just one last thing
before we head out.

12:59.121 --> 13:01.955
You said there were
four victims.

13:02.043 --> 13:05.645
You sure there were no, uh,
no survivors, no witnesses?

13:06.770 --> 13:08.575
That's right. Just the four.

13:09.786 --> 13:11.528
Copy that.

13:11.616 --> 13:12.526
<i>The NSA</i>

13:12.614 --> 13:14.215
lied to our face. Twice.

13:14.411 --> 13:16.065
Yeah. Meanwhile,
I am telling the truth,

13:16.153 --> 13:17.453
so can you take
these cuffs off, please?

13:17.540 --> 13:18.666
Yeah, not happening.

13:18.754 --> 13:19.581
Not that we can take them

13:19.674 --> 13:21.218
at their word,
but for what it's worth,

13:21.306 --> 13:22.871
they're saying
the computers were wiped.

13:22.958 --> 13:24.783
Hope that's true.
For all our sakes.

13:24.871 --> 13:25.992
Well, the fact
is, any number

13:26.080 --> 13:27.313
of foreign countries
and rogue groups

13:27.400 --> 13:28.500
would want to hit this place.

13:28.587 --> 13:30.438
Yeah, whoever it was,
someone had to clue them in

13:30.525 --> 13:31.640
on the office's location.

13:31.728 --> 13:32.880
So who knew about it?

13:33.290 --> 13:35.601
Aside from a few suits
at the Pentagon and DOD,

13:35.689 --> 13:37.081
it was just the six of us
at the station.

13:37.168 --> 13:38.179
Hang on. Six?

13:38.267 --> 13:40.721
You said it was you
and the four victims.

13:40.938 --> 13:42.100
So who's the sixth?

13:42.188 --> 13:44.470
Our branch chief,
Michael Flores.

13:44.580 --> 13:45.641
That's the guy
we just talked to.

13:45.728 --> 13:47.288
Why wasn't he there
this morning?

13:47.376 --> 13:49.070
Had a briefing
at the FBI field office,

13:49.158 --> 13:50.290
said he'd be in late.

13:50.511 --> 13:51.884
Oh. Well, that's convenient.

13:52.103 --> 13:54.988
Either Agent Flores
is one very lucky man...

13:55.078 --> 13:56.594
Or he knew about
the attack in advance.

13:56.681 --> 13:58.869
Okay, guys,
we got eyes on Flores.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.288
I think we're gonna go ask him.

14:10.495 --> 14:12.625
Hands. Keep them
where I can see them.

14:14.188 --> 14:15.489
Open the door.

14:17.176 --> 14:18.716
Shut the door.

14:18.866 --> 14:20.546
Turn around,
put your hands on the vehicle.

14:24.999 --> 14:26.202
Turn around.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.270
There's that famous
Five-O hospitality.

14:29.358 --> 14:31.637
Oh, that's, uh, that's rich,
coming from the person

14:31.725 --> 14:33.241
who just lied to us twice.

14:33.397 --> 14:35.950
We know what was really
going on at that station.

14:36.038 --> 14:38.231
We also know Aaron Wright
was working for you

14:38.319 --> 14:39.419
and that he got away.

14:39.507 --> 14:40.507
You got him?

14:40.624 --> 14:41.160
No.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.185
- We were hoping that you did.
- Still looking for him.

14:43.272 --> 14:44.629
All right, he's
a tough guy

14:44.717 --> 14:45.942
to pin down, just like you.

14:46.030 --> 14:47.177
What's that supposed to mean?

14:47.264 --> 14:48.585
Well, we did
our homework.

14:48.759 --> 14:51.942
You were supposed to be at an
FBI field office this morning.

14:52.030 --> 14:54.491
The security logs show
that you were never there.

14:54.936 --> 14:56.520
Got changed
to the U.S. District Court.

14:56.608 --> 14:57.671
Why don't you check the logs?

14:57.758 --> 15:01.639
We will. You got an explanation
for everything, don't you?

15:02.506 --> 15:03.887
Why don't you
do us a favor

15:03.975 --> 15:04.858
and explain this?

15:04.946 --> 15:06.616
That's a photograph of you

15:06.727 --> 15:08.702
and Colonel
Farzin Shogredhi

15:08.820 --> 15:11.069
having lunch in Istanbul
last month.

15:12.296 --> 15:15.069
Why don't you tell me
why you would be breaking bread

15:15.435 --> 15:18.116
with a high-ranking member
of Iran's.

15:18.225 --> 15:19.661
Revolutionary Guard?

15:19.749 --> 15:21.031
It's curious, and given

15:21.118 --> 15:23.090
that your office targets
Iran's missile programs,

15:23.178 --> 15:24.473
it's possibly treasonous.

15:24.561 --> 15:25.725
Where'd you get that photo?

15:25.813 --> 15:27.396
From a buddy of mine at Langley.

15:27.668 --> 15:31.678
Well, your buddy clearly
wasn't read into this op.

15:32.085 --> 15:33.967
The man in that photo,

15:34.155 --> 15:37.569
Colonel Shogredhi, is one of
our most trusted double agents.

15:37.663 --> 15:41.511
He's been working
the American side for years now.

15:41.725 --> 15:44.100
You understand, Commander?

15:44.788 --> 15:47.012
It's taken me five
years to establish

15:47.100 --> 15:49.598
this station's global
intelligence footprint.

15:49.686 --> 15:52.061
Do you think that I want
to see it destroyed?

15:52.156 --> 15:55.514
Or see what happened
to my colleagues?

15:55.744 --> 15:57.319
McGarrett.

15:57.407 --> 15:59.905
Commander, it's Officer Kai.

16:00.038 --> 16:02.491
The officers sitting
on Aaron Wright's place noticed

16:02.608 --> 16:04.281
a suspect attempting
to break in.

16:04.368 --> 16:07.328
When they engaged him,
gunfire was exchanged.

16:07.418 --> 16:08.911
One officer was hit.
He's in stable condition.

16:08.998 --> 16:10.371
And the suspect?

16:10.577 --> 16:14.069
He's dead. No ID on him,
but CSU pulled a print.

16:14.194 --> 16:16.264
Lab is running it now.

16:19.210 --> 16:22.720
Results are back. Our dead
shooter's name is Adlan Rugova.

16:22.808 --> 16:24.091
He's an international
gun for hire

16:24.178 --> 16:25.721
wanted by authorities
across Europe.

16:25.808 --> 16:27.971
Let me guess, he came
in under an alias.

16:28.058 --> 16:29.721
Correct. And he
didn't travel alone.

16:29.808 --> 16:33.938
We checked CCTV at HNL
arrivals and it seems Rugova

16:34.027 --> 16:35.772
was accompanied by
two other gentlemen.

16:35.860 --> 16:38.317
Facial rec IDed them
as Petra Salamov

16:38.405 --> 16:40.708
<i>and Andre Malaj,
Albanian nationals.</i>

16:40.796 --> 16:41.856
Aaron here confirmed

16:41.944 --> 16:43.529
that these were the guys
that hit the NSA station.

16:43.616 --> 16:44.590
That's them, for sure.

16:44.678 --> 16:46.121
100%. No way
I'm forgetting those faces.

16:46.208 --> 16:48.418
Uh, let's get their names
and their photographs out

16:48.506 --> 16:50.231
to all authorities,
ports, airports.

16:50.319 --> 16:52.632
Jerry, dig into this, see if you
can find out who hired them.

16:52.719 --> 16:54.223
- Copy that.
- Here's the good news.

16:54.311 --> 16:56.131
I'm thinking these guys must
still be on the island.

16:56.218 --> 16:58.872
They're guns for hire, which
means they don't get paid

16:58.960 --> 17:00.131
until the job is done.

17:00.218 --> 17:02.358
And right now, their job
is killing Aaron Wright.

17:02.530 --> 17:05.021
Which is why we're gonna
let them take a shot.

17:05.138 --> 17:06.241
Wait, what?

17:06.329 --> 17:08.108
Sounds to me like
you're bait.

17:14.085 --> 17:15.381
<i>All right, here's the deal.</i>

17:15.469 --> 17:16.771
We have to find out
who hired these hitters,

17:16.858 --> 17:18.667
which means we have to take
at least one of them alive.

17:18.755 --> 17:20.287
Okay, I thought
the whole point was that

17:20.374 --> 17:21.676
we're using Wright as bait.
Where is he?

17:21.763 --> 17:23.925
He's in Rendition,
safe and sound.

17:24.013 --> 17:25.835
All you need is this:

17:26.006 --> 17:27.036
Wright's phone.

17:27.124 --> 17:28.127
I'm the bait?

17:28.215 --> 17:29.452
You and Junior.

17:29.600 --> 17:30.637
I'm gonna put you guys

17:30.725 --> 17:32.317
in a tactical, unmarked SUV.

17:32.405 --> 17:34.091
Okay, so we're just gonna
drive around and wait

17:34.178 --> 17:35.326
for them to get up
on our location

17:35.413 --> 17:36.512
and start shooting at us?

17:36.600 --> 17:37.688
Exactly.

17:37.836 --> 17:39.426
That's a great plan.

17:42.010 --> 17:43.264
<i>All right, Steve, you know</i>

17:43.352 --> 17:44.722
<i>where to find me
if you need me.</i>

17:45.006 --> 17:46.867
All right, take care, buddy.

17:47.424 --> 17:48.504
Damn it.

17:48.592 --> 17:50.590
Hey, yo, that didn't
sound so good.

17:50.678 --> 17:51.747
Everything okay?

17:51.843 --> 17:54.021
No, Percy,
everything is not okay.

17:54.109 --> 17:55.454
Listen, if you got
to get back, man,

17:55.541 --> 17:56.927
- it's all right.
- Nah, they...

17:57.015 --> 17:59.630
We halfway there now.
T-They got enough people.

17:59.718 --> 18:00.798
- They're fine.
- All right.

18:00.885 --> 18:02.492
Let's just get
this over with.

18:02.593 --> 18:05.958
You know, why they got
to steal your recipe?

18:06.046 --> 18:07.959
- Can't blame them for trying.
- What you mean?

18:08.047 --> 18:10.040
Kamekona's restaurant
is doing pretty good.

18:10.127 --> 18:11.609
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

18:11.697 --> 18:14.013
- Profits are going through the roof.
- Really?

18:14.101 --> 18:17.257
Yeah. We packed,
breakfast, lunch and dinner.

18:17.406 --> 18:19.554
Oh, and I suppose
that that's all due

18:19.648 --> 18:22.677
to your would-famous
kouign-amann, then, huh?

18:22.767 --> 18:24.007
In part, yeah.

18:24.288 --> 18:25.679
Makes sense.

18:26.429 --> 18:28.060
Hey, you know
something? Uh...

18:28.343 --> 18:29.749
I'm thinking about
making a move.

18:29.837 --> 18:31.171
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:31.304 --> 18:32.351
Open my own shop.

18:32.439 --> 18:34.041
Oh, that's good. Good for you.

18:34.609 --> 18:36.921
You play your cards right,

18:37.009 --> 18:39.749
I might let you get in
on the ground floor.

18:40.826 --> 18:42.022
Is that right?

18:42.110 --> 18:43.140
Yes, sir.

18:43.228 --> 18:44.834
Mm-hmm.

18:46.861 --> 18:48.539
Yo, man, what are we doing?

18:48.627 --> 18:51.023
What are you doing, brah?

18:52.046 --> 18:54.029
Let me ask you
a question, Percy.

18:54.117 --> 18:56.443
Why is it that whenever you want
to ask me for one thing,

18:56.531 --> 18:58.318
you do it by asking
for something else?

18:58.406 --> 19:00.529
- Man, come on.
- Boy, I've been a cop for 30 years.

19:00.617 --> 19:03.220
You think I don't know a load
of bull when I smell one?

19:03.307 --> 19:05.529
Here I am, driving
all the way to the North Shore

19:05.617 --> 19:08.600
chasing behind your "stolen
recipe," when the truth is,

19:08.687 --> 19:10.365
all you want to do
is soften me up

19:10.453 --> 19:12.656
to get me to invest
in your new bakery.

19:12.828 --> 19:14.770
You know, Percy,
if you want me to invest

19:14.857 --> 19:16.922
in one of your harebrained
schemes, why don't you just say,

19:17.009 --> 19:19.818
"Hey, Lou, I got a harebrained
scheme. You want to invest?"

19:19.906 --> 19:21.737
And then I'll say,
"Hell no, Percy,

19:21.827 --> 19:22.906
and then we can just move on.

19:22.993 --> 19:24.157
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:24.247 --> 19:26.577
- Let's get one thing straight, little brother.
- What?

19:26.667 --> 19:29.233
I don't need your help, brah.

19:29.373 --> 19:30.592
What?

19:30.733 --> 19:32.177
Besides, what the hell
makes you think

19:32.264 --> 19:33.620
I would want you to have you
as a partner?

19:33.707 --> 19:35.137
You just pitched me this thing.

19:35.225 --> 19:36.412
It don't matter!

19:36.500 --> 19:37.959
If I ask you what time it is,

19:38.047 --> 19:40.404
you'd tell me
how to build a watch.

19:40.686 --> 19:42.801
You think that 'cause you've
been a cop for 30 years,

19:42.889 --> 19:44.881
you know every damn thing,
and I'm just an idiot

19:44.983 --> 19:46.199
with a harebrained scheme?

19:46.287 --> 19:48.470
Let me tell you something,
L'il Percy.

19:48.557 --> 19:49.937
Well, bring it, brah.

19:51.239 --> 19:52.443
Bring it.

19:53.319 --> 19:54.395
I apologize.

19:54.483 --> 19:55.606
Yeah, well, you know what?

19:55.694 --> 19:57.748
You can kiss my black...

19:59.173 --> 20:00.451
What did you say, brah?

20:00.539 --> 20:03.952
I mean it, Percy.
I was being a jerk. I'm sorry.

20:04.342 --> 20:05.657
You feeling okay,
little brother?

20:05.818 --> 20:07.577
Shut up, fool.

20:09.747 --> 20:11.037
You're so stupid.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.476
No, you stupid.

20:12.563 --> 20:13.997
Percy, I'm
your brother.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.191
Yeah.

20:15.278 --> 20:16.527
I-I'm not one of these guys

20:16.615 --> 20:18.040
you deal with out in the streets

20:18.127 --> 20:19.475
back in Chicago.

20:20.006 --> 20:22.115
Y-You ain't got to try
to be slick when you want

20:22.209 --> 20:24.449
to ask me for something
you need if you need it.

20:24.537 --> 20:26.470
I love you, man. Damn.

20:26.557 --> 20:27.970
And I love you, too,
little brother.

20:28.193 --> 20:29.510
So does that, uh,

20:30.063 --> 20:31.309
that mean you gonna come in...

20:31.397 --> 20:33.680
Hell no, I'm not giving
you any money, boy.

20:33.767 --> 20:37.318
I said I love you, I didn't say
I just lost my damn mind.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.693
Are you crazy?

20:40.607 --> 20:44.490
Now, let's go get
this pastry-stealing punk.

20:51.739 --> 20:56.166
I feel like w-we're, like,
gazelles at a watering hole.

20:56.264 --> 20:58.209
Do you not watch, uh,
nature documentaries?

20:58.297 --> 20:59.457
Like, there's
always a gazelle

20:59.545 --> 21:01.489
at a watering hole,
she's minding her own business,

21:01.576 --> 21:03.140
she's getting a sip of water,
and then...

21:03.227 --> 21:06.272
and a lion comes up and...
and eats her.

21:06.467 --> 21:07.779
I feel like that.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.522
That's basically us.
We're just driving around,

21:10.795 --> 21:15.227
waiting for some Euro assassins
to, uh, start shooting at us.

21:15.317 --> 21:16.631
Gazelles.

21:16.951 --> 21:18.217
Hmm?

21:21.733 --> 21:24.443
My parents won't be coming
to the parole hearing today.

21:25.928 --> 21:28.069
- What?
- I meant to tell you before,

21:28.157 --> 21:31.764
But there was always a plan
for me to go on my own.

21:31.852 --> 21:33.896
The truth is, my dad doesn't
even know it's happening.

21:33.983 --> 21:35.525
My mom found the notice
in the mail,

21:35.613 --> 21:37.358
she just didn't tell him.

21:37.747 --> 21:39.233
Yeah, we figured
it was for the best.

21:40.483 --> 21:42.960
So you have to go there

21:43.047 --> 21:46.920
and then make a statement
on behalf of your family?

21:47.007 --> 21:48.209
It's-it's all on you?

21:48.297 --> 21:49.920
- Mm-hmm.
- That seems like.

21:50.178 --> 21:51.260
A lot of pressure.

21:51.347 --> 21:54.123
Yeah. It's not the kind
I'm used to, either.

21:54.211 --> 21:56.334
Well, you're not going alone.
I'm coming with you.

21:56.422 --> 21:58.014
No, no, you don't have to.

21:58.154 --> 21:59.669
I know.

22:03.349 --> 22:04.355
Hey.

22:04.443 --> 22:06.363
So we've been digging
into everyone that worked

22:06.451 --> 22:08.583
in this NSA office,
and it turns out

22:08.671 --> 22:11.915
taking highly skilled hackers
and giving them NSA cyber tools

22:12.029 --> 22:13.568
can have unintended
consequences.

22:13.656 --> 22:16.619
One of our dead analysts,
a Mr. Tim Aquino,

22:16.707 --> 22:18.251
was running
a side hustle,

22:18.339 --> 22:20.459
using his NSA resources
to blackmail

22:20.547 --> 22:21.497
everyday citizens.

22:21.585 --> 22:23.412
- What kind of blackmail?
- Standard stuff.

22:23.507 --> 22:26.363
He was pulling texts and e-mails
off of people's devices,

22:26.451 --> 22:28.581
threatening to reveal
compromising photos,

22:28.669 --> 22:30.888
details of affairs,
other illegal activities.

22:30.976 --> 22:33.261
He'd get a few grand
per shakedown, and then

22:33.349 --> 22:35.552
a couple of weeks ago, he hit
pay dirt on something big

22:35.648 --> 22:38.247
because that's when he opened up
an account in Zurich

22:38.335 --> 22:41.014
into which 325K
were recently wired.

22:41.186 --> 22:42.389
We traced the wire

22:42.966 --> 22:44.859
and it came back to this guy.

22:44.947 --> 22:48.599
Meet Alan Kinross,
CEO of Cryolaris Technologies.

22:48.687 --> 22:51.984
It's a medical device
manufacturer based on Oahu.

22:52.072 --> 22:56.279
Okay, so this CEO just paid
a small fortune in blackmail.

22:56.367 --> 22:59.513
I'm thinking it's probably not
to cover up something salacious,

22:59.601 --> 23:00.746
like an affair.

23:00.834 --> 23:02.414
More like a corporate scandal.

23:02.502 --> 23:04.992
Something that could take down
a publicly traded company.

23:05.080 --> 23:07.117
Yeah, I tried digging
deeper into Cryolaris,

23:07.205 --> 23:08.007
but I hit a wall.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.459
It seems they installed
some next level cyber security

23:10.547 --> 23:11.711
after the blackmail payment.

23:11.799 --> 23:14.529
So Tim Aquino uncovers something
about this company,

23:14.617 --> 23:17.180
and then threatens them.
The company makes a big payment,

23:17.267 --> 23:19.110
and now they don't
want the information out there.

23:19.197 --> 23:21.781
So they hire hitters
to take out the NSA office

23:21.869 --> 23:23.007
and wipe all the drives.

23:23.095 --> 23:25.209
- Yeah.
- Burying the scandal for good.

23:25.297 --> 23:27.672
All right, look, my instinct is
we bring the CEO in

23:27.760 --> 23:29.984
and rake him over the coals,
find out what he's hiding,

23:30.072 --> 23:31.235
but this guy looks
like he'd be

23:31.322 --> 23:32.610
lawyered up and
probably with the best,

23:32.697 --> 23:34.455
so we need some evidence before
we go anywhere near him.

23:34.542 --> 23:37.275
Jerry, we need to look under the
hood of this company, and now.

23:37.363 --> 23:40.116
I hear you, but their servers
are air-gapped.

23:40.204 --> 23:41.544
Accessing the
data requires

23:41.632 --> 23:42.792
being physically on site,

23:42.869 --> 23:44.304
and I can handle that,

23:44.392 --> 23:46.032
but I can't do it
while also hacking

23:46.119 --> 23:49.032
into their security so I can get
in and navigate the building.

23:49.119 --> 23:51.212
Sounds like you could
use some help.

23:54.548 --> 23:56.118
Me and my big mouth.

24:01.773 --> 24:04.896
Uh-oh. Did you come here
to lay me out again, Slugger?

24:04.983 --> 24:08.483
Sadly, no. I'm here because
we have to work together.

24:17.541 --> 24:21.187
Hi, there. Ron Janderman,
Oahu HVAC Repair.

24:21.275 --> 24:22.875
Here for a
service call.

24:23.103 --> 24:24.286
Janderman...

24:24.374 --> 24:25.814
Janderman...

24:26.400 --> 24:27.803
Don't have you here.

24:28.077 --> 24:29.718
Can I see some ID?

24:30.407 --> 24:31.573
Please don't tell me I went

24:31.661 --> 24:32.944
to the wrong address again.

24:33.071 --> 24:35.165
Stop messing around
and do your job.

24:35.454 --> 24:37.243
My boss is gonna
have my ass.

24:37.712 --> 24:39.048
You're good to go.

24:39.231 --> 24:40.731
Hey, will you do a guy a solid

24:40.821 --> 24:42.697
and just check
one more time, please?

24:47.103 --> 24:48.443
There you are.

24:48.531 --> 24:51.093
Must've missed it.
Elevator Four will

24:51.181 --> 24:52.484
take you down
to the basement.

24:52.572 --> 24:55.726
Sorry, big guy. Had to make him
sweat a little, am I right?

24:55.814 --> 24:57.010
Let me tell you
something, you pull another

24:57.097 --> 24:59.704
stunt like that, you're leaving
this van in a bag.

25:00.407 --> 25:02.711
Copy that. Hold up, Jer.

25:03.376 --> 25:05.964
You can step off
that elevator in three...

25:06.540 --> 25:09.322
two... one.

25:12.811 --> 25:16.141
All clear. Now we are the only
ones that can see the live feed.

25:18.641 --> 25:20.798
Chop, chop. Don't go left,
don't right, go straight

25:20.886 --> 25:22.846
through the double doors.

25:27.064 --> 25:28.704
We got a problem.

25:28.938 --> 25:30.944
There's a biometric
palm scanner.

25:31.032 --> 25:32.602
This was supposed to be
a super-hackable.

25:32.689 --> 25:34.348
RFID badge reader.

25:34.436 --> 25:36.384
Looks like you could use a hand.

25:36.817 --> 25:38.491
Come on, that was solid.

25:38.579 --> 25:40.273
Stupid. Make it work.

25:40.361 --> 25:42.382
- Less talking, more helping.
- Relax.

25:42.470 --> 25:44.544
This is gonna be easy
like a Sunday morning.

25:44.631 --> 25:47.532
Why? Wh...
Just stop talking.

26:04.652 --> 26:06.780
I spent a few weeks hacking
palm scan access ATMs

26:06.868 --> 26:08.901
in Japan.
Paid for my whole trip.

26:09.514 --> 26:10.634
And then some.

26:15.587 --> 26:17.074
All right, Jerry,
how you doing in there?

26:17.161 --> 26:18.784
65%, almost there.

26:18.871 --> 26:20.210
All right, Steve, check it.

26:20.298 --> 26:22.081
Oh, oh, oh, Jerry, Jerry,
you got company,

26:22.171 --> 26:23.491
you got a bogey.

26:23.579 --> 26:25.782
A security guard headed
towards the server room.

26:26.579 --> 26:27.782
I need more time.

26:27.870 --> 26:28.952
Do something.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.025
What, do you think I'm back here
playing Fortnite?

26:48.961 --> 26:50.204
Hello?

26:50.376 --> 26:51.861
Mr. Anahi, this is.

26:51.951 --> 26:55.312
Ed LaFontaine of lead
counsel in HR Legal.

26:55.400 --> 26:56.616
Uh, we need to speak

26:56.704 --> 26:59.587
to you about a conduct complaint
our office received.

27:02.461 --> 27:04.312
Seems some very
serious allegations

27:04.400 --> 27:05.624
have been levied
against you.

27:05.712 --> 27:08.179
You need to come up
to floor seven immediately.

27:08.267 --> 27:10.461
Of course. I'll be right there.

27:14.025 --> 27:15.259
What do you say, pal?

27:15.347 --> 27:16.569
I'm not your pal,

27:16.657 --> 27:17.731
but thanks.

27:17.819 --> 27:19.116
Journey of a thousand miles

27:19.204 --> 27:21.344
begins with a baby step,
so I'll take it.

27:21.595 --> 27:23.655
He's good at what he does.
I'll give him that.

27:23.743 --> 27:26.474
Yeah, but the face,
the face is-is so punchable.

27:26.561 --> 27:27.931
Yeah.

27:28.924 --> 27:30.797
That's a mountain of data
you got there, Jer.

27:30.885 --> 27:32.654
How are you gonna find a needle
in that haystack?

27:32.741 --> 27:35.931
Split the haystacks.
I'm digging into finances.

27:36.019 --> 27:37.783
And I'm on legal
searching for keywords

27:37.871 --> 27:39.290
like "exposure,"

27:39.378 --> 27:41.581
"non-disclosure,"
and "settlement."

27:41.818 --> 27:44.901
Oh, speaking of settlement,
I found a bunch of payments,

27:45.121 --> 27:46.898
big ones, all clustered between.

27:46.986 --> 27:49.079
May and October of 2017.

27:49.322 --> 27:51.426
Narrowing my search
of that timeframe.

27:56.242 --> 27:57.341
Oh, my, my.

27:57.429 --> 27:58.613
Let me see that.

27:59.314 --> 28:01.423
Yeah, this is bad.

28:01.595 --> 28:03.724
Two years ago,
Cryolaris developed

28:03.811 --> 28:06.322
a cutting-edge
new anesthesia machine.

28:06.650 --> 28:09.017
Only problem was the three
people it killed during R&D.

28:09.236 --> 28:10.650
Three people killed?

28:10.738 --> 28:13.384
With those numbers, there's no
way this machine goes to market.

28:13.486 --> 28:14.779
Yeah, and yet, it did.

28:15.031 --> 28:16.571
And quite the market it's been.

28:16.661 --> 28:18.595
They cleared half a billion
on this device alone.

28:18.782 --> 28:19.694
They do the math

28:19.781 --> 28:22.343
and decide it's cheaper
to pay out settlements

28:22.431 --> 28:24.260
than fix the product flaw
that's killing people?

28:24.347 --> 28:25.953
This information got
out, we're talking

28:26.041 --> 28:27.476
a Class I FDA recall,

28:27.564 --> 28:29.970
millions in payouts
and penalties.

28:30.058 --> 28:32.368
Yeah, not to mention
criminal negligence charges

28:32.456 --> 28:33.507
for the top brass.

28:33.595 --> 28:35.070
All right, sounds like
there's a whole bunch of people

28:35.157 --> 28:37.468
that need to be rounded up,
starting with the CEO. Adam,

28:37.556 --> 28:39.328
call HPD. Have them lend
a hand with the arrests.

28:39.415 --> 28:41.710
Jerry, reach out to the FDA.
We got to get this machine.

28:41.798 --> 28:43.931
Off the market
before it kills somebody else.

28:44.021 --> 28:45.172
You want to task me
to do something?

28:45.259 --> 28:47.001
I do. Stop talking.

28:47.314 --> 28:49.524
- Junior, what's good?
- Hey, looks like the hitters

28:49.611 --> 28:51.823
- took the bait. We just picked up a tail.
- Where you at?

28:51.910 --> 28:54.009
Heading east on Kanealii.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.443
- We're passing Star Road.
- All right, here we go.

28:56.531 --> 28:58.451
They're making an approach.

29:03.548 --> 29:05.161
All right, I got eyes on them.

29:05.251 --> 29:06.744
Yep, it's our hitters.

29:06.831 --> 29:08.361
Okay, hold on.

29:16.171 --> 29:18.381
- We're in pursuit.
- Don't lose them. I'm on the way.

30:28.667 --> 30:30.627
RPG incoming, one o'clock!

30:31.317 --> 30:32.756
Hang on!

30:56.031 --> 30:59.488
Tani, you okay?

31:01.151 --> 31:02.611
Yeah.

31:43.262 --> 31:45.684
Told you my plan would work.

31:46.147 --> 31:47.988
Yeah, like a charm.

31:58.919 --> 32:00.284
Mr. Kinross, how you doing?

32:00.372 --> 32:01.542
I'm Commander Steve McGarrett,

32:01.629 --> 32:03.042
this is Jerry Ortega.

32:03.129 --> 32:05.504
Thank you for the names.
Now I know who to sue.

32:05.592 --> 32:08.172
- You're welcome.
- Spoken like a true corporate scumbag.

32:08.259 --> 32:09.422
So, an hour ago,

32:09.509 --> 32:12.707
I, uh, I personally pulled this
phone off of a dead assassin.

32:12.795 --> 32:14.520
What's that got to do with me?

32:14.645 --> 32:16.602
- Well...
- Well, you see, this phone gave me access.

32:16.689 --> 32:18.559
To the dead guy's
overseas bank accounts,

32:18.840 --> 32:20.942
one of which shows
a large payment from you.

32:21.030 --> 32:22.622
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:22.710 --> 32:24.841
That's fine. I'm gonna break it
down for you, all right?

32:24.928 --> 32:26.848
In this phone,
there is evidence of you

32:27.043 --> 32:29.232
personally sending
a wire transfer

32:29.319 --> 32:32.161
of $325,000 to Tim Aquino.

32:32.285 --> 32:34.368
Tim Aquino is the NSA agent

32:34.456 --> 32:36.520
who blackmailed you
and your company. You remember?

32:36.678 --> 32:38.461
We know about the
devices you were selling.

32:38.549 --> 32:40.579
Remember?
The highly profitable ones

32:40.786 --> 32:43.412
that saved lives but also
occasionally killed people?

32:43.575 --> 32:45.137
But what
we didn't know

32:45.293 --> 32:48.253
was that your company has
a secret little slush fund.

32:48.429 --> 32:51.712
A slush fund that you used
to hire a bunch of paid gunmen

32:51.815 --> 32:53.965
to kill Tim Aquino
and three of his colleagues.

32:54.053 --> 32:55.817
Wait, wait, wait. What?

32:55.905 --> 32:57.770
That's right. Right here.

32:57.895 --> 33:00.325
We got you tied
to blackmail and murder.

33:00.519 --> 33:02.729
Basically, dude,
you're in deep.

33:02.903 --> 33:04.439
I want my lawyer.

33:04.973 --> 33:07.442
Probably not the worst idea.

33:09.700 --> 33:11.270
So what's next for Mr. Wright?

33:11.358 --> 33:13.419
Same as before. He can continue
to working for the government,

33:13.506 --> 33:14.717
or go to jail.

33:14.805 --> 33:15.909
Hmm. Decisions, decisions.

33:15.999 --> 33:17.112
Hey.

33:17.247 --> 33:18.528
You're back
on my radar.

33:18.616 --> 33:20.029
You mess up one more time,
I'm gonna make sure

33:20.116 --> 33:22.567
you're out of a job and back
in prison. Are we clear?

33:22.709 --> 33:24.606
I'll be a good boy, I promise.

33:24.824 --> 33:26.277
Put 'er there, partner.

33:26.879 --> 33:28.199
Really?

33:28.343 --> 33:29.981
I thought we had made
some progress.

33:30.069 --> 33:32.443
I'm not decking you again.
That's progress.

33:33.240 --> 33:35.509
Well, it's been a pleasure
working with you.

33:35.756 --> 33:37.326
All of you.

33:37.806 --> 33:40.490
Look at me, I'm getting
teary-eyed. In fact,

33:40.578 --> 33:42.939
are you guys sure you don't have
a spot for me on your roster?

33:43.026 --> 33:44.834
I feel like you guys
could use my help.

33:44.982 --> 33:46.514
I'm sure you pay better
than the NSA, too.

33:46.601 --> 33:47.533
It's like peanuts over there.

33:47.621 --> 33:48.529
That's enough, let's go.

33:48.617 --> 33:50.083
I'm just saying,
there's a reason why Tim Aquino

33:50.170 --> 33:52.010
needed that extra 325K.

33:57.654 --> 33:58.959
Hey, Jer...

33:59.217 --> 34:01.459
...I meant to tell you
this morning:

34:01.592 --> 34:04.132
that was a hell
of a right cross.

34:04.982 --> 34:06.443
Yeah, I agree.

34:06.629 --> 34:08.614
I'm just jealous
I didn't get in one of my own.

34:08.703 --> 34:10.703
Thanks.

34:17.887 --> 34:19.630
Mm.

34:20.879 --> 34:22.172
Wow.

34:23.318 --> 34:25.443
Man, this thing
is the meaning of life.

34:27.052 --> 34:28.896
My compliments to the chef.

34:29.031 --> 34:32.318
Thank you. They're flying off
the shelves, that's for sure.

34:32.406 --> 34:34.013
They damn well should be.

34:34.159 --> 34:37.152
And priced right, too. $3.65.

34:37.239 --> 34:40.699
You ain't slick. One for every
day of the year, right?

34:41.460 --> 34:43.013
And all these things,

34:43.109 --> 34:44.773
- you-you bake right here, in-house?
- Mm-hmm.

34:44.860 --> 34:47.435
Since 1968.
My mother opened the place.

34:47.748 --> 34:49.068
All the recipes are hers.

34:49.156 --> 34:50.411
Is that right?

34:50.500 --> 34:52.310
Well, I'll tell you what,
this thing here...

34:52.614 --> 34:55.326
I've never even heard of it.
This, this, uh,

34:55.661 --> 34:57.341
<i>koogan, kween-uh...</i>

34:57.429 --> 34:58.427
Kouign-amann.

34:58.515 --> 34:59.645
Huh?

35:01.893 --> 35:04.201
It's called kouign-amann.

35:04.289 --> 35:05.074
Oh.

35:05.162 --> 35:07.507
The pastry originated
in Northern France.

35:07.649 --> 35:08.699
My parents

35:08.787 --> 35:09.935
tried it on their honeymoon.

35:10.023 --> 35:11.248
Your parents
didn't eat no damn

35:11.422 --> 35:13.842
kouign-amann in France
or no other damn place.

35:14.058 --> 35:16.357
That's my recipe,
and you stole it.

35:16.479 --> 35:18.006
I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:18.094 --> 35:19.646
Oh, I think you do.

35:19.804 --> 35:21.982
And you'd better cop to it
before my brother

35:22.070 --> 35:23.795
goes all "Hulk smash"
up in here.

35:23.883 --> 35:26.213
All right, relax.
You got me, okay?

35:27.416 --> 35:28.795
It's not a family recipe.

35:28.883 --> 35:30.615
'Course it's not
a family recipe,

35:31.373 --> 35:33.129
'cause your thieving ass
stole it from me.

35:33.217 --> 35:35.349
- All right, Percy.
- I didn't steal anything.

35:35.437 --> 35:36.183
- You did.
- I swear. No...

35:36.271 --> 35:37.584
we bake everything
else here.

35:38.086 --> 35:40.836
But these,
we buy wholesale.

35:41.278 --> 35:42.451
Wait, what?

35:42.929 --> 35:44.302
Wholesale?

35:44.873 --> 35:48.357
Exactly who are you buying
these things wholesale from?

35:48.454 --> 35:49.701
Yeah.

35:49.796 --> 35:51.865
<i>You know, I'm really
disappointed in you, Flippa.</i>

35:52.060 --> 35:53.913
I mean, you're the last person
in the world I thought

35:54.000 --> 35:55.388
would do something
like this.

35:55.616 --> 35:57.326
Explain yourself.

35:57.421 --> 36:00.060
Ever since my food truck
burned down,

36:00.148 --> 36:02.373
I've been trying
to reopen a new business.

36:02.461 --> 36:03.902
Kamekona mentioned

36:03.990 --> 36:07.240
your baked goods being
the "toast of the restaurant."

36:07.475 --> 36:09.279
So I've been testing the market,

36:09.646 --> 36:11.012
seeing what kind
of appetite there is

36:11.099 --> 36:13.029
for the best pastries
I ever tasted.

36:13.401 --> 36:16.240
Turns out, sky's the limit.

36:16.330 --> 36:17.830
So, let me get this right.

36:18.053 --> 36:20.256
My hard work becomes
your side hustle.

36:20.555 --> 36:21.896
How is that fair to me, man?

36:21.984 --> 36:23.123
You're not hearing me.

36:23.211 --> 36:26.123
I want us to start
a wholesale business.

36:26.263 --> 36:27.450
Together.

36:28.107 --> 36:29.881
Was planning on talking
to you next week

36:29.969 --> 36:31.732
after I crunched the numbers.

36:32.096 --> 36:33.396
What?

36:34.926 --> 36:37.521
Man, I-I don't know
what to say, man.

36:37.609 --> 36:42.467
Say yes. We partner up,
split the profits 70-30.

36:42.590 --> 36:45.300
No, no, no.
I think you mispronounced 50-50.

36:45.827 --> 36:48.162
Bruddah, I'll be putting up
the capital,

36:48.250 --> 36:51.826
taking all the risk;
ergo, I take more of the profit.

36:51.959 --> 36:53.061
All right,
first of all, who said

36:53.148 --> 36:54.481
you putting up
all the capital?

36:55.388 --> 36:56.662
Count me in.

36:56.750 --> 36:58.240
Grover brothers in for half.

36:58.328 --> 36:59.256
That works.

36:59.375 --> 37:01.998
Lou, you'd do that for me, man?

37:02.092 --> 37:03.616
Didn't you hear him say
sky's the limit?

37:03.703 --> 37:05.052
I'm doing it for me.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.342
But yeah.

37:06.530 --> 37:07.935
That's what
brothers do.

37:08.087 --> 37:09.207
I love you, brother.

37:09.313 --> 37:10.802
Eh, I love you, too.

37:10.890 --> 37:12.006
Yeah.

37:12.094 --> 37:13.131
Next time, ask.

37:13.219 --> 37:14.483
- All right, sorry.
- Come on, bring it in.

37:14.570 --> 37:16.357
Thank you, thank you.

37:16.697 --> 37:18.802
Hey, you guys,
you guys are so...

37:18.890 --> 37:21.052
- Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Okay, okay,

37:22.494 --> 37:25.324
<i>The Hawaii Paroling
Authority will now hear</i>

37:25.412 --> 37:27.061
the case for early release
of inmate.

37:27.149 --> 37:28.392
Palani Kuewa.

37:28.587 --> 37:30.130
Inmate has served
six years

37:30.218 --> 37:32.819
of his first-degree negligent
homicide conviction.

37:33.249 --> 37:35.522
The board has reviewed
the inmate's parole plan

37:35.610 --> 37:37.796
and recognize
Mr. Kuewa's completion

37:37.884 --> 37:39.921
of IOP substance
abuse treatment

37:40.009 --> 37:42.991
in addition to his involvement
in community outreach programs

37:43.079 --> 37:45.159
during his incarceration.

37:46.529 --> 37:49.659
Mr. Kuewa, I understand
you'd like to say something?

37:54.259 --> 37:58.009
On the night of August 5, 2012,
I made a mistake.

37:58.255 --> 38:01.958
I had a few too many drinks, and
I got behind the wheel of a car.

38:02.060 --> 38:03.353
People do it
all the time,

38:03.441 --> 38:05.894
but the difference is,
because of me,

38:06.105 --> 38:09.921
a young woman died, and several
more lives were ruined.

38:10.929 --> 38:13.757
There's nothing I can do
or say that'll change that.

38:14.044 --> 38:16.413
This system is supposed
to be about justice,

38:16.501 --> 38:19.593
but if there were
any real justice in this world,

38:20.110 --> 38:21.733
Maya Reigns would still
be alive,

38:21.821 --> 38:23.890
and I'd be in her place.

38:26.282 --> 38:28.022
All I can
tell you is this:

38:28.919 --> 38:30.483
whatever the board
decides today,

38:30.571 --> 38:32.674
it won't change what I do
with the rest of my life,

38:32.762 --> 38:35.569
which is to continue the work
I started in prison,

38:35.836 --> 38:38.593
educating people
and doing everything I can

38:38.681 --> 38:42.304
to make sure that no one makes
the same terrible mistake I did.

38:45.082 --> 38:46.733
But as for forgiveness?

38:47.582 --> 38:50.042
I would never think to ask
your family for that,

38:50.187 --> 38:53.272
because I know I will
never forgive myself.

39:05.428 --> 39:07.201
The board
will now hear a statement

39:07.289 --> 39:09.872
from the immediate family
of the victim, Maya Reigns.

39:10.528 --> 39:11.738
Please.

39:21.918 --> 39:23.857
My name is Junior Reigns.

39:23.945 --> 39:25.648
Maya was my sister.

39:25.854 --> 39:27.365
I'm here on behalf of my family

39:27.453 --> 39:29.363
to argue for parole
to be denied.

39:39.834 --> 39:44.404
See, in my line of work,
I see the worst kind of people.

39:44.629 --> 39:46.474
People beyond reform,

39:47.041 --> 39:48.842
beyond forgiveness.

39:50.336 --> 39:54.592
But this man that I just heard,
he's not that.

39:55.951 --> 39:57.881
You know, I came
here thinking that

39:57.969 --> 40:01.873
he needed to pay for what
he did, for what he took.

40:03.045 --> 40:04.433
But honestly,
I wouldn't even know

40:04.521 --> 40:06.021
what that price
would look like.

40:09.049 --> 40:11.342
What I do know
is that the hate

40:11.430 --> 40:13.162
that I've carried
towards this man

40:13.250 --> 40:15.146
has cost me
way too much.

40:16.989 --> 40:19.310
It's blocked out my
good memories of Maya.

40:19.416 --> 40:22.006
And I-I'm afraid that some
of them are gone for good.

40:23.563 --> 40:25.933
I don't want to give hate
that power anymore.

40:27.505 --> 40:29.373
I want to remember
my sister for the joy

40:29.461 --> 40:32.084
that she brought to this world,
and not for what happened

40:32.172 --> 40:33.654
that one day.

40:35.720 --> 40:37.349
I owe her that much.

40:41.983 --> 40:44.677
And I know what Maya
would want me to do today.

40:46.566 --> 40:47.943
Thank you.

41:10.327 --> 41:13.154
I really think
you did the right thing.

41:15.584 --> 41:17.599
I hope my dad sees it that way.

41:28.878 --> 41:29.911
We got a problem.

41:29.998 --> 41:32.581
Whoa, whoa. Slow down.
Slow down. What's going on?

41:32.668 --> 41:33.668
When Wright was leaving,

41:33.758 --> 41:36.930
he mentioned the 325K
that Kinross paid to Aquino.

41:37.018 --> 41:38.314
The thing is,
he was down in Rendition

41:38.401 --> 41:40.117
when I discovered
that wire transfer.

41:40.205 --> 41:42.091
So how did he know
the exact amount?

41:42.178 --> 41:45.031
Here's how. He was aware
of Tim Aquino's blackmail scam,

41:45.119 --> 41:46.758
and he used that to play us.

41:46.846 --> 41:47.766
Wait. What?

41:47.854 --> 41:49.613
I looked into the payment
made to the hitters.

41:49.700 --> 41:52.241
It originated overseas and then
was rerouted through dozens

41:52.329 --> 41:54.822
of anonymous IP addresses
to make it look like

41:54.947 --> 41:56.902
it came from Cryolaris,
when it actually came from...

41:56.989 --> 42:00.130
Aaron Wright.
We got to call Flores.

42:00.218 --> 42:01.008
Wright knows the tech

42:01.096 --> 42:02.875
in that NSA station
is worth millions,

42:02.963 --> 42:04.698
so he hires a team to
pull it off the drives,

42:04.785 --> 42:05.977
wipe them, then takes out

42:06.065 --> 42:07.361
the entire office
for good measure.

42:07.448 --> 42:09.400
Yeah, and he gets away with it
by pinning it all on Cryolaris

42:09.487 --> 42:10.994
and making himself
look like a victim.

42:11.106 --> 42:12.297
Son of a bitch.

42:12.470 --> 42:13.862
This is Agent Flores.

42:14.093 --> 42:15.948
Hey, this is Steve McGarrett.
I'm on speaker?

42:16.036 --> 42:17.071
No.

42:17.159 --> 42:18.128
All right, keep it that way.

42:18.218 --> 42:20.128
Listen to me very carefully.
Don't react.

42:20.346 --> 42:22.666
Wright set this whole thing up.

42:22.822 --> 42:24.562
It was his play
from the beginning.

42:33.518 --> 42:35.528
Flores, talk to me!
