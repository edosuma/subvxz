01:59.995 --> 02:02.623
<i>Pup Star</i> is going on world tour!

02:02.831 --> 02:06.710
It is my absolute pleasure
to introduce our newest judge:

02:07.085 --> 02:10.547
the one, the only Tiny!

02:17.179 --> 02:18.680
Tiny, welcome back.

02:19.222 --> 02:22.059
Oh, my goodness.
It's so great to be back, Jimmy.

02:22.225 --> 02:25.437
Tell us,
how did this whole judge thing come about?

02:26.021 --> 02:29.650
Did you ask them? Did they ask?
Did you take someone hostage?

02:29.733 --> 02:31.943
- What happened here?
- You know, Jimmy,

02:32.027 --> 02:36.281
there are so many amazing pups
around the world who deserve this chance.

02:36.365 --> 02:40.160
I realized that even though
I loved being your <i>Pup Star</i> champion,

02:40.619 --> 02:43.747
I was ready to help other dogs
fulfill their dreams.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.583
She is quite a pup, huh?

02:47.793 --> 02:49.336
What's next, Bark's back?

03:00.347 --> 03:03.266
Our rehabilitation engineers
work around the clock

03:03.350 --> 03:06.019
to turn wayward dogs into model citizens.

03:06.228 --> 03:10.440
<i>Canine Correctional Magazine</i> voted us
two paws, making us number one

03:10.524 --> 03:12.943
in penal cuisine nationwide.

03:13.985 --> 03:19.324
And here we play sad movie clips
to awaken their emotional synapses.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.993
<i>Get! I don't want you anymore!</i>

03:22.869 --> 03:24.496
Don't believe him, Air Bud.

03:25.247 --> 03:26.456
It's a ruse.

03:30.627 --> 03:35.298
My ball therapy program reduces
inmate stress through exercise.

03:35.507 --> 03:36.842
Now, I must warn you.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.928
This prisoner may be
the single most evil dog

03:40.011 --> 03:42.222
in the history of the world, ever.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.390
His name...

03:44.307 --> 03:45.142
is Bark.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.687
You probably recognize him
from TV's <i>Pup Star.</i>

03:49.563 --> 03:53.567
Now, this is the newest
behavior modification device.

03:53.734 --> 03:57.070
It's used only
on the most hard-core cases.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.822
Allow me to demonstrate.

04:00.365 --> 04:04.369
Who's the cutest
and most talented Pup Star of all time?

04:05.620 --> 04:06.747
Who is it?

04:09.708 --> 04:11.084
Tiny. It's Tiny.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.628
She's amazing. Everyone loves her.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.130
The results speak for themselves,

04:16.505 --> 04:18.716
Bark is almost completely reformed.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.012
Very interesting, warden,

04:22.137 --> 04:23.764
but let's cut to the chase.

04:23.847 --> 04:26.767
Where has the rest
of the taxpayers' money gone?

04:26.850 --> 04:31.104
Anyhoo. Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm very busy. I have dogs to save.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.107
- Butch.
- Right this way, folks.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.026
Thank you.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.907
This facility was based
on a paw print by Frank Lloyd Bite.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.369
All clear! Show's over.

04:51.333 --> 04:54.377
Sorry, Bark.
I had to convince them it was real.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.713
- I think they bought it.
- Get this off.

04:57.422 --> 05:00.509
Here. Okay, there you go.

05:00.592 --> 05:01.968
Now you put it on.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.893
- There.
- The remote. Hand it over.

05:09.976 --> 05:10.811
Fine.

05:20.987 --> 05:24.074
You're right,
this new therapy is fantastic.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.617
Now turn on the TV.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.748
<i>This is the year to be on</i> Pup Star.

05:31.832 --> 05:35.252
We all know you're leaving tomorrow
on a four-month tour,

05:35.335 --> 05:39.005
so we thought a special send-off
was in order. What do think?

05:39.089 --> 05:42.884
Oh, here comes another
of your hilarious pranks, Jimmy.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.598
Well, Simon,
get ready to eat that yawn.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.893
<i>The Jimmy Kibble Show</i> went on tour,
and we started back

05:52.018 --> 05:55.146
in your beloved home
of Merry Olde England.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.024
<i>Hello, lad. What's the good word?</i>

05:58.108 --> 06:01.361
Gramps. What are you doing here,
you old scoundrel?

06:01.695 --> 06:05.448
Wanted to pop in and wish
me number one grandson bon voyage.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.659
You mind your P's and Q's, lad.

06:07.742 --> 06:11.788
I will, Gramps. I promise.
Promise. Wish I could bring you with me.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.832
Me, travel? Ho-ho.

06:13.915 --> 06:18.128
Not blooming likely. I'll be at the pub
watching the Pup Star World Tour

06:18.211 --> 06:20.839
on the telly with me mates.
Love you, nipper.

06:21.673 --> 06:24.968
Now I see where you get
your sunny disposition, Simon.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.303
From the isle of Britain

06:26.386 --> 06:28.930
to the isle of Jamaica, mon.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.849
Let's keep this tour going!

06:31.766 --> 06:32.601
- <i>Pops.</i>
- <i>Dad.</i>

06:32.684 --> 06:33.518
<i>Papa.</i>

06:33.602 --> 06:38.565
<i>Buyaka! Diggy, Rollin and Gnarly Jr.
It's good to see my litter is behaving.</i>

06:38.648 --> 06:40.275
We want a champion.

06:40.358 --> 06:43.111
Me gonna try, pups,
me gonna try real hard.

06:43.194 --> 06:46.781
- Are you going to Egypt?
- Yeah, mon. All around the world.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.450
So cool!

06:48.533 --> 06:52.412
<i>Bring us a pyramid!
Bring us a pyramid! Bring us a...</i>

06:52.495 --> 06:53.496
Oh, wowzer!

06:53.997 --> 06:56.833
They're just a bundle of energy,
aren't they?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.753
So, now let's head on over
to Lady Paw Paw's home

06:59.836 --> 07:01.379
of New Jersey.

07:02.005 --> 07:02.881
<i>Is it on?</i>

07:04.257 --> 07:05.592
<i>Am I on?</i>

07:05.675 --> 07:08.803
Mama, we see you, we hear you.

07:08.887 --> 07:11.056
Oh, my goodness. How do I look?

07:11.139 --> 07:12.724
You look pretty, Mama.

07:12.807 --> 07:16.937
I hear you're gonna be a jet-setter
around the globe.

07:17.312 --> 07:21.191
But be sure to take your Pupto-Bismol.

07:21.524 --> 07:24.402
<i>You know you get gassy on planes.</i>

07:24.486 --> 07:28.323
OMD. Mom, we're on national TV.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.450
International, heh, actually.

07:30.533 --> 07:34.162
Oh, so, now I'm embarrassing you.

07:34.746 --> 07:38.541
I carry you for nearly 68 days,

07:38.625 --> 07:41.753
and this is the thanks I get?

07:41.836 --> 07:45.173
- Again with the guilt trip.
- <i>You know you're still my...</i>

07:45.757 --> 07:50.095
Tiny, I hear a number of your family
are here in our studio audience?

07:50.178 --> 07:52.389
Yes, Jimmy. They're right over there.

07:52.973 --> 07:57.602
By my girl Lou, there's my dad Steven,
my nanny Ida, and Shep, my manager.

07:57.686 --> 08:01.314
But, come on, now,
your crew wouldn't be complete without...

08:01.481 --> 08:03.608
<i>Hey, what's up, T? Remember us?</i>

08:04.526 --> 08:06.444
P.U.P.! Oh my gosh!

08:06.528 --> 08:08.613
Yo, yo. What's shaking, sister?

08:08.697 --> 08:10.198
My tail, that's what.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.701
Scraps,
how's the recording session going?

08:12.784 --> 08:14.327
I'm crushing it.

08:14.411 --> 08:17.205
Of course,
Scrappy will be defending her title.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.542
I'm glad I'm not competing against her.

08:21.126 --> 08:23.753
<i>Pup Star, world tour!
Let's hear it for them!</i>

08:23.962 --> 08:25.672
<i>All right, stay tuned...</i>

08:25.755 --> 08:28.299
Aw, look, everyone has somebody
they care about.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.467
Hear that knock?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.971
It's opportunity.

08:39.394 --> 08:42.105
Judges! What's got you excited
about the tour?

08:42.188 --> 08:44.566
Think of all the wardrobe possibilities.

08:44.733 --> 08:48.194
I've had my stylist
working overtime for this.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.530
My fans won't be disappointed.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.868
Finally, I get to show Pup fans
the promised land.

08:54.951 --> 08:59.247
Africa, mon. It's like catnip for Rastas.
So long, America.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.459
I'm most excited to land, okay?

09:02.542 --> 09:06.379
As far as I'm concerned,
dogs should keep four paws on the ground.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.757
Wake me up when we get to New Delhi.

09:09.215 --> 09:12.635
Simon! Are audiences really ready
for international talent?

09:12.802 --> 09:17.015
Tour's already happening. A little late
for silly questions, isn't it?

09:18.850 --> 09:22.520
Well, see you in four months, I guess.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.147
Here goes nothing.

09:24.230 --> 09:27.650
Maybe having your best friend
with you will help, huh?

09:28.443 --> 09:31.071
- Wait, are you saying...?
- Surprise road trip?

09:31.154 --> 09:33.740
Really? Dad, are you serious?

09:33.823 --> 09:35.158
Yes!

09:36.076 --> 09:40.080
Sisters on tour. Hashtag "Best Day Ever."

09:40.705 --> 09:42.665
I love you. And it's educational.

09:43.374 --> 09:47.462
At least that's what I'm telling myself.
Shep, take care of our girls.

09:47.545 --> 09:48.505
You got it.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.381
- Have fun.
- Love you.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.142
Goodbye, everyone. See you in India.

10:08.733 --> 10:12.946
In New Delhi, we begin searching
for the special canine crooners,

10:13.029 --> 10:17.158
one of whom will become the first ever
Global Pup Star Champion.

10:17.492 --> 10:18.868
Are you ready?

10:18.952 --> 10:21.746
This is Pup Star: World Tour.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.584
Dogs and dogettes, your judges.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.378
Namaste, <i>India!</i>

10:28.920 --> 10:31.756
- There she is. Oh, she's so cute.
- It's Tiny.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.008
Bright colors, vivid patterns,

10:34.092 --> 10:35.718
bling everywhere.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.220
I'm home.

10:37.303 --> 10:41.057
All right, India. Give me your sad sacks,
your talentless hacks,

10:41.141 --> 10:45.186
your half-baked divas
yearning for unearned stardom.

10:45.270 --> 10:49.107
Come on, Growl.
Let your love in, mon. One love.

10:50.859 --> 10:54.988
Get those golden bones ready
because here's our very first contestant.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.662
<i>You're the king...</i>

13:08.663 --> 13:12.208
<i>...but I will make you immortal.
Welcome to Team Growl!</i>

13:12.291 --> 13:13.835
That's my grandson.

13:13.918 --> 13:17.463
Picking the fancy lad, even.
That's an open mind, that is.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.882
Always was a sensitive pup.

13:22.427 --> 13:25.471
Mind the tiller, lads.
Time to call it a night.

13:31.728 --> 13:35.064
Oi! Aren't you Grandpa Growl?

13:35.148 --> 13:36.899
It depends who's asking.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.985
Hop right in, guvnah.

13:43.823 --> 13:44.824
Here we are.

13:45.616 --> 13:49.120
What's this, then?
Some kind of ride-sharing program?

13:49.203 --> 13:51.748
No, mate, it's your lucky day.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.292
Yeah, congratulations, guv.

13:54.917 --> 13:58.379
We're here to escort you
to the <i>Pup Star</i> finale.

13:58.463 --> 14:02.675
A special surprise
from your grandson, isn't it? Heh, heh.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.427
What's the catch?

14:04.510 --> 14:06.095
You're flying cargo.

14:13.269 --> 14:17.106
<i>You're doing great, sis.
You're gonna pick the champ for reals.</i>

14:17.190 --> 14:22.111
Thanks, Scrappy, but it's hard to choose
when there's so many great contestants.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.198
<i>Go with your instincts.
You'll know the right one.</i>

14:25.281 --> 14:26.824
<i>Don't you worry, Ms. Tiny.</i>

14:26.908 --> 14:30.328
<i>I will pray to St. Anthony
to find you the best contestant.</i>

14:30.411 --> 14:33.414
We could talk all night.
It's time to get some rest.

14:33.623 --> 14:36.125
Tomorrow's another continent,
another show.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.586
- Love you, guys.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.463

15:03.236 --> 15:05.780
India set a high bar, I have my pick.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.074
So, now I just get to sit back

15:08.157 --> 15:11.411
and watch my colleagues
drool all over themselves.

15:11.994 --> 15:14.372
Poodles don't drool, bulldogs do.

15:14.455 --> 15:18.126
Old Jamaican proverb,
"Good things come to those who wait."

15:18.251 --> 15:21.587
In England, we say,
"The early bird catches the worm."

15:21.671 --> 15:23.214
Rather delicious.

15:23.548 --> 15:24.382
Ew.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.008
Disgusting.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.094
Who wants to catch a worm?

15:28.719 --> 15:32.640
Our next competitor Mobo
is a park ranger and conservationist

15:32.723 --> 15:34.559

15:34.642 --> 15:38.312
He's not just an animal,
he's an animal lover. Give him a hand!

15:40.356 --> 15:43.901
<i>I spend my days on
the nature preserve hunting for poachers.</i>

15:55.746 --> 15:59.417
<i>The sounds of my animal brethren
is what inspires my music.</i>

16:00.751 --> 16:03.963

27:15.175 --> 27:18.262
Señor Bark, I am a professional.

27:18.762 --> 27:21.390
I am Julio, hero to Mexico.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.142
Maybe on your little soap opera.

27:24.226 --> 27:27.104
Please. Telenovela.

27:27.187 --> 27:30.607
I can do it without your interference,
thank you very much.

27:30.691 --> 27:34.444
You'll do exactly as you're told
or I'll devour you like a taco.

27:34.528 --> 27:36.363
Do I make myself clear?

27:38.073 --> 27:39.074
Crystal.

27:39.700 --> 27:40.534
Crystal clear.

27:42.828 --> 27:47.624
He's a crowd favorite. He's the star
of telenovela <i>Perros de Nuestras Vidas...</i>

27:47.708 --> 27:49.126
You're up next, Bark.

27:49.209 --> 27:54.131
Now, dogs and dogettes,
this is not a stunt. We have the Julio!

27:56.758 --> 27:58.552
Oh, I don't wanna overhype Julio,

27:58.635 --> 28:01.930
- but I'm gonna say Julio... Shh.
- <i>Who is Julio, you ask?</i>

28:02.014 --> 28:03.390
Let's find out.

28:03.473 --> 28:06.184
<i>I was born outside the city,</i>

28:06.268 --> 28:13.150
at the dump, where I lived with <i>mi madre,
cuatro hermanos, mi hermanita.</i>

28:13.233 --> 28:16.278
- <i>Until one day I found</i> mi pasión
- Hmm? Huh.

28:17.112 --> 28:19.281
<i>buried deep in the trash.</i>

28:22.242 --> 28:25.329
<i>It was love at first sight.</i>

28:30.250 --> 28:34.421
Then, one day,
the floods came down the auroras,

28:34.504 --> 28:37.716
<i>wiping out</i> mi familia entina <i>in a flash.</i>

28:42.387 --> 28:45.307
Oh, my gosh.
Here come the waterworks.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.767
No family?

28:46.850 --> 28:48.268
Oh, my goodness.

28:48.352 --> 28:49.853
Oh, please.

28:49.937 --> 28:52.856
You lot would cry
if a mic stand fell over.

28:52.940 --> 28:55.484
<i>I said to myself, "Julio?</i>

28:56.485 --> 29:01.490
<i>You must become a star,
in the memory of</i> tu familia."

29:02.115 --> 29:03.200
<i>And I did.</i>

29:05.869 --> 29:06.828
<i>Enough about me.</i>

29:07.955 --> 29:10.207
<i>For now, we sing!</i>

29:12.125 --> 29:14.419
Time to take back <i>Pup Star.</i>

29:14.503 --> 29:18.715
And now, the dog that needs
no introduction, but he requested one...

Thank you, my fans!

31:44.027 --> 31:48.365
I cannot believe I, the humble Julio,
am on this stage,

31:48.532 --> 31:51.660
in the presence
of such additional greatness.

31:55.664 --> 31:57.374
Julio, you're my pick.

31:57.707 --> 31:59.584
Welcome to Team Tiny.

31:59.668 --> 32:01.586
Tiny.

32:02.838 --> 32:06.466
- <i>I shall not disappoint you.</i>
- We got Julio! We got Julio.

32:06.550 --> 32:08.677
Okay, now take a rose over for Tiny.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.810
Julio is so <i>suave.</i>

32:18.061 --> 32:20.564
What a chump.
I never seen someone act so thirsty.

32:21.148 --> 32:23.400
I don't know, it's working for me.

32:23.483 --> 32:26.153
Tiny, I didn't think it was possible.

32:26.736 --> 32:30.991
You are even more ravishingly beautiful
in person.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.034
Uh... Why, thank you.

32:34.369 --> 32:37.414
I can't wait to show you my hometown,
Chicago.

32:38.165 --> 32:40.375
<i>I humbly accept your invitation.</i>

32:40.709 --> 32:41.585
Wonderful.

32:41.835 --> 32:46.089
Of course, I humbly accept your
generous invitation to stay at your <i>casa.</i>

32:46.173 --> 32:49.634
I am so honored
to be welcomed into your <i>familia.</i>

32:49.718 --> 32:53.013
Oh. Oh, no. No, I meant someday, not...

32:53.096 --> 32:56.308
I have not known a real home
since my family was...

32:57.058 --> 32:57.893
Was...

32:58.685 --> 33:01.938
Right. Of course, <i>mi casa es tu casa.</i>

33:02.898 --> 33:04.566
What just happened here?

33:06.109 --> 33:09.654
<i>Who says Americans aren't hospitable?
Huh?</i>

33:11.281 --> 33:14.034
We're excited you girls are coming home.

33:14.117 --> 33:18.622
<i>There's something I have to tell you.
We have a surprise guest.</i>

33:20.916 --> 33:22.375
Hi.

33:22.459 --> 33:25.754
<i>Julio will be staying with us
for the next few weeks.</i>

33:25.837 --> 33:29.090
<i>Muchas gracias</i>
for your generous offer of hospitality.

33:29.549 --> 33:32.886
Don't worry.
You'll hardly know I'm there. Adiós.

33:34.638 --> 33:38.683
Julio. I'll be your point man
for all things Tiny. So...

33:38.767 --> 33:42.687
The name is Señor Julio.
My agent will forward you a list

33:42.771 --> 33:47.150
of requirements for my stay. I trust
they will be fulfilled. Failure is...

33:47.692 --> 33:49.277
Uh... How you say...?

33:49.528 --> 33:50.487
...not an option.

33:51.530 --> 33:52.364
Okay.

<i>♪ That's where you'll stay

34:00.914 --> 34:03.458
<i>♪ I'll put you in the doghouse ♪</i>

34:04.709 --> 34:06.586
Your flow is <i>savage,</i> Scraps.

34:06.670 --> 34:11.091
You think? It was a lot simpler
when we'd just freestyle, you know?

34:13.009 --> 34:15.594
Enough about me. How's the studio doing?

34:15.679 --> 34:19.933
It's blowing up like gangbusters,
but what's the point of this success

34:20.016 --> 34:22.936
if I don't have anyone to share it with?
You know?

34:23.436 --> 34:24.853
I'm missing Tiny, too.

34:25.647 --> 34:29.859
She'd love to see your muzzle.
Why don't you take a little initiative?

34:30.150 --> 34:33.280
Groom up,
surprise her with flowers at the airport.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.447
Hey, yeah. That's a great idea.

34:51.005 --> 34:52.591
- Julio!
- Julio!

34:52.674 --> 34:55.969
- Welcome to America!
- What's this chump doing here?

34:56.052 --> 34:57.971
Cease your weeping, America!

34:58.346 --> 35:01.099
At long last, Julio has landed.

35:01.182 --> 35:03.560
You look so good as a couple.

35:03.643 --> 35:04.644
Hey!

35:04.728 --> 35:05.729
Hi!

35:06.896 --> 35:08.982
Shep, have you seen P.U.P.?

35:09.399 --> 35:11.610
Uh... He wasn't on my schedule.

35:12.068 --> 35:13.820
Julio, can we get a quote?

35:14.279 --> 35:16.656
- Lewis, go.
- Hey! There's my girls.

35:16.740 --> 35:19.242
Welcome home. Mm.

35:19.326 --> 35:21.578
Live with the Pup Star.

35:21.661 --> 35:23.079
- And you must be Julio.
- Oh.

35:23.913 --> 35:26.166
<i>Bienvenidos,</i> Señor Julio.

35:27.584 --> 35:31.296
And you must Eva Fangoria.

35:31.671 --> 35:33.298
Oh.

35:33.381 --> 35:34.883
Oh, no, Señor Julio.

35:35.008 --> 35:36.343
I am Ida.

35:36.426 --> 35:40.722
Señor Steven, <i>muchas gracias</i>
for your generous hospitality.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.098
Of course, Julio.

35:42.432 --> 35:44.768
- Shall we go? Come on!
- Come on, let's go.

35:52.317 --> 35:53.777
Hmm.

35:54.444 --> 35:56.571
Taste that brisk Chicago air.

35:57.072 --> 36:00.784
Shep. Be so kind to bring my bags
to my room, <i>sí?</i>

36:01.159 --> 36:02.744
Uh...

36:04.162 --> 36:05.914
<i>Si,</i> Señor Julio.

36:11.544 --> 36:13.254
I don't want to be a bother.

36:13.380 --> 36:17.384
Show me where you shall put me,
and I shall accept it, oh, so humbly.

36:17.467 --> 36:20.261
This is the guest room,
and you'll be staying, uh...

36:21.137 --> 36:23.014
It's... Okay.

36:34.818 --> 36:36.277
A bit feminine, but...

36:37.028 --> 36:38.113
it shall do.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.532
Well, actually, this is my room...

36:40.615 --> 36:42.575
Oh, don't you worry, Mr. Steven,

36:42.742 --> 36:46.204
I will make the guest room
is very comfortable for you.

36:46.496 --> 36:50.500
Ah, good, Shep. I was wondering
what happened to you.

36:50.583 --> 36:54.754
Put my things in here,
and Ida, yes, she shall unpack me.

36:57.048 --> 37:00.135
<i>Con permiso,</i> please. Out of the way, Shep.
Okay.

37:00.218 --> 37:04.264
Get some rest, Julio.
Tomorrow we'll start rehearsals.

37:05.515 --> 37:07.142
Okay.

37:11.688 --> 37:13.314
- Morning.
- Morning, Daddy!

37:13.523 --> 37:14.816
Morning.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.281
Mm.

37:28.496 --> 37:30.123
Ida, <i>rapido!</i>

37:32.000 --> 37:33.835
Ah, Ida!

37:38.256 --> 37:41.092
It's so hard to find good help in America.

37:42.427 --> 37:46.181
<i>Presidente,</i> I have defeated
the King of the Chupacabras.

37:47.015 --> 37:48.516
The orphanage is saved.

37:51.686 --> 37:55.190
<i>Sweet, the trusting, foolish Julio.</i>

37:55.273 --> 37:57.817
<i>Chupacabra don't even have a king!</i>

37:59.194 --> 38:02.947
- My long-lost twin brother slash enemy.
- But if you're here,

38:03.406 --> 38:05.283
then where is El Presidente?

38:05.700 --> 38:07.911
Don't you mean our long-lost father?

38:07.994 --> 38:10.079
<i>You murdered El Presidente.</i>

38:10.163 --> 38:12.415
Julio is El Presidente now.

38:12.499 --> 38:14.417
- Long live me!
- <i>Long live me!</i>

38:18.755 --> 38:20.256
Sorry, señor.

38:20.882 --> 38:23.343
My paws were filthy from traveling,

38:23.843 --> 38:28.014
and your brush... she is the perfect size
to get between my toes.

38:53.289 --> 38:55.333
You've gotta be kidding me.

39:28.283 --> 39:31.870
P.U.P., Dawg Pound Records took you
from flat broke

39:31.953 --> 39:35.164

How's it feel?

39:35.248 --> 39:39.669

39:47.135 --> 39:50.096
So, Tiny, you must be relieved
to be back home.

39:50.346 --> 39:53.057
- How is your family?
- Oh, they're the best. I...

39:53.141 --> 39:58.605

To what do I owe the honor of this visit?

41:56.639 --> 41:58.182
Time for phase two.

41:58.808 --> 42:02.729
Bark wants compromising photos
of you and Tiny. Tabloid material.

42:03.646 --> 42:06.357
It's time to step up your game, <i>muchacho.</i>

42:06.441 --> 42:07.984
Tabloids?

42:08.484 --> 42:10.945
I will not. It is beneath me.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.822
Says the soap opera actor.

42:12.905 --> 42:15.575
Besides, they can
never seem to get my good side.

42:16.743 --> 42:19.370
How'd you like to have no good sides?

42:19.454 --> 42:22.081
Uh, perhaps I can compromise.

42:22.165 --> 42:25.251
- Good call.
- You are gonna take Tiny out for dinner.

42:25.334 --> 42:28.337
There's a restaurant
called El Tapas Perros.

42:28.421 --> 42:30.965
When you see my signal,
plant a kiss on her.

42:31.340 --> 42:32.383
Clear, Julio?

42:32.467 --> 42:34.218
As crystal.

42:35.053 --> 42:35.887
Crystal clear.

42:37.346 --> 42:40.058
Ah. There you are, my <i>chiquita.</i>

42:40.308 --> 42:41.142
Julio.

42:41.559 --> 42:44.771
It's go time.
We're only a week away from the finale,

42:44.854 --> 42:47.648
and we haven't even rehearsed once
together.

42:47.732 --> 42:50.485
Ah, you Americans stress too much.

42:50.568 --> 42:53.571
Stress is no good for the vocal cords.

42:53.654 --> 42:55.907
Relax. I am a natural performer.

42:55.990 --> 42:57.617
But I'm your mentor.

42:57.867 --> 42:59.619
I'm responsible for you.

42:59.702 --> 43:01.412
I will make you a deal.

43:01.496 --> 43:03.164
Tomorrow, we shall sing.

43:03.247 --> 43:06.918
Tonight, we shall celebrate
my regal Spanish heritage.

43:07.210 --> 43:09.295
And I know just the place.

43:09.378 --> 43:10.296
Fine.

43:10.671 --> 43:12.465
One night of relaxing,

43:13.049 --> 43:15.927
- and then we get down to business.
- Wonderful.

43:16.010 --> 43:18.971
- Shep, arrange it. Reservations for two.
- Hmm?

43:19.055 --> 43:20.681
Tonight at El Tapas Perros.

43:23.810 --> 43:25.353
<i>Si,</i> Señor Julio.

43:30.858 --> 43:33.611
Mm-mm.

43:37.448 --> 43:39.617
Oh.

43:40.743 --> 43:41.577
Huh.

43:45.164 --> 43:47.166
Ooh. Mm.

43:53.339 --> 43:57.051
Shep, I must insist you take pictures
for my Instagrowl.

43:57.135 --> 43:59.679
My fans are... very demanding.

43:59.762 --> 44:02.849
You can't take photos here.
It's a lifetime ban.

44:03.182 --> 44:05.935
There are no second chances
at El Tapas Perros.

44:06.018 --> 44:07.186
You will improvise.

44:13.359 --> 44:15.570
All right, get on it with it, Romeo.

44:16.195 --> 44:18.573
Oh, wow, I have to bring P.U.P. here.

44:18.656 --> 44:20.491
The view is perfect.

44:20.575 --> 44:23.202
Not as perfect as the view
across the table.

44:23.411 --> 44:26.164
Not as perfect
as the view across this table,

44:26.247 --> 44:28.708
my canine <i>corazón.</i>

44:29.000 --> 44:29.834
Uh...

44:29.917 --> 44:32.712
Thanks, Julio.
You're always so complimentary.

44:32.795 --> 44:35.798
- Don't use your own lyrics.
- I can't hear you.

44:35.882 --> 44:38.259
Oh, sorry. I'll speak up.

44:38.342 --> 44:39.886
That guitar is quite loud.

44:48.019 --> 44:49.770
Like a flower needs the sun,

44:50.354 --> 44:51.689
I need you near.

44:51.772 --> 44:53.774
I'm right here.

44:53.858 --> 44:56.903
Flowers, sun. What are you talking about?

44:58.362 --> 45:00.448
Pardon me, I'm just going gonna...

45:04.327 --> 45:08.706
When will you look into my eyes
and say the words I long to hear?

45:08.789 --> 45:10.416
Okay, to be candid,

45:10.499 --> 45:13.669
you won't win <i>Pup Star</i>
just because you're popular.

45:13.753 --> 45:16.964
You need to focus.

45:17.048 --> 45:19.967
Darling, we belong together,
can't you see?

45:20.051 --> 45:23.638
Wait a sec,
aren't those the lyrics to your song?

45:23.721 --> 45:26.807
Come on, dial it back.
You're not that good.

45:26.891 --> 45:28.517
<i>She's smarter than you.</i>

45:29.477 --> 45:33.439
My heart is aching.
I'm yours for the taking.

45:33.522 --> 45:36.150
Really?
Enough with the song lyrics already.

45:36.233 --> 45:39.070
You're blowing it.
Go in for the kiss already!

45:43.282 --> 45:45.534
- Bingo.
- Julio, what are you doing?

45:49.830 --> 45:54.377
My <i>señorita,</i>
when will you share your romance with me?

45:54.460 --> 45:55.753
Have you gone crazy?

45:56.671 --> 45:59.548
I'm with P.U.P.!
This is so unprofessional.

46:05.888 --> 46:07.098
We got her!

46:10.685 --> 46:13.729
Before the puperazzi arrive,
we need to get out.

46:16.023 --> 46:17.441
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

46:31.539 --> 46:33.332
This is all my fault.

46:33.416 --> 46:36.127
Curse my fiery Latin blood.
I should leave.

46:36.460 --> 46:37.378
Julio, no!

46:37.795 --> 46:42.508
Don't listen to those DMZ media vultures,
spreading their lies and fake news.

46:42.591 --> 46:46.220
How dare you. That photo
is taken completely out of context.

46:46.303 --> 46:49.098
If you don't publish a retraction,
we'll sue...

46:50.224 --> 46:53.060
A personal concert
at your doggie's bark mitzvah?

46:54.520 --> 46:56.105
OMG! What a nightmare.

46:56.605 --> 47:00.192
I'm on damage control.
We need to issue a statement

47:00.276 --> 47:03.696
that there is no Juliny.
This relationship is professional.

47:03.779 --> 47:06.532
Julio tripped,
Don't know how this happened.

47:06.615 --> 47:12.121
Oh. To top it off, my phone gets stolen.
Now I'm stuck with this retro disaster.

47:12.204 --> 47:13.748
Aha.

47:13.831 --> 47:16.625
But, Shep, isn't this your phone?

47:16.709 --> 47:19.920
Julio, heh, you're a lifesaver.

47:20.004 --> 47:21.297
Not so fast, <i>amigo.</i>

47:22.048 --> 47:25.926
You know, Shep,
you were the one taking photos that night.

47:26.635 --> 47:30.806
Of course I was, Señor Julio,
because you asked me to.

47:30.890 --> 47:33.225
How much did they pay you, Shep?

47:33.684 --> 47:35.019
You're accusing me?

47:35.102 --> 47:38.606
- Me?
- Who else had the photos that night?

47:38.898 --> 47:42.193
It is a no-phone policy
at El Tapas Perros.

47:42.651 --> 47:44.737
- Very gauche, <i>amigo.</i>
- Ooh.

47:44.820 --> 47:46.822
Julio, let me see Shep's phone.

47:47.740 --> 47:50.284
Steve, you know I would never do anyth...

47:51.202 --> 47:52.286
Please.

47:59.085 --> 48:00.252
That's not...

48:00.336 --> 48:02.797
You can't think I'm responsible for that.

48:04.256 --> 48:08.094
Shep... I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to terminate your services.

48:16.519 --> 48:19.396
Never trust a human with a dog's name.

48:21.023 --> 48:22.733

48:37.456 --> 48:39.375
And why won't P.U.P. pick up?

48:39.750 --> 48:41.836
I want to explain what happened.

48:42.294 --> 48:44.046
Maybe he just needs to...

48:44.505 --> 48:47.091
I don't know, maybe he needs to cool off?

48:47.424 --> 48:49.510
He'll never speak to me again.

49:02.106 --> 49:05.609

sweeps a lonely, insecure,
seriously unstylish pup off her paws.

49:35.681 --> 49:39.226
Yes. I mean, no. I mean...

So, that's it. It's over.

49:59.121 --> 50:02.708
Tiny, I know this has all been <i>muy loco.</i>

50:02.791 --> 50:05.336
But Julio is deeply sorry.

50:05.419 --> 50:09.173
It's all right, Julio.
It's not like you published the photos.

50:10.966 --> 50:12.843
Yeah. As your friend,

50:13.052 --> 50:14.595
I have brought you a gift.

50:15.012 --> 50:17.306
Lou, will you do me the honors?

50:17.806 --> 50:18.641
Okay.

50:22.561 --> 50:23.729
It's so pretty.

50:28.108 --> 50:31.904
- Thanks for being a good friend, Julio.
- Go Team Tiny.

50:32.321 --> 50:34.406
New York City awaits.

50:38.702 --> 50:43.332
- Think you can handle Scrappy on your own?
- I got this, don't worry about it.

50:43.916 --> 50:47.169
I was a professional
dog procurement engineer for years,

50:47.253 --> 50:49.880
so I think I can handle one street rat.

50:49.964 --> 50:51.507
Yeah, of course.

50:51.590 --> 50:52.633

52:06.123 --> 52:07.499
Uh-oh.

52:07.833 --> 52:08.959
Going somewhere?

52:09.043 --> 52:12.212
Fancy meeting you here, Cyclops.

52:13.589 --> 52:15.674
I told you I could handle this.

52:15.758 --> 52:17.718
Yeah, no, I see that.

52:23.974 --> 52:25.517
I'm fine!

52:28.604 --> 52:31.815
- Scrappy's not answering,
- I'm worried about Scrappy.

52:32.399 --> 52:35.444
- She's never this late.
- I'll go in to check on her.

52:36.236 --> 52:38.364
- Just to be safe.
- Okay, Daddy.

52:38.447 --> 52:40.074
- I love you.
- I love you.

52:40.908 --> 52:43.327
Kano? Roland? What're they doing here?

52:44.745 --> 52:47.456
Sending the jabroni in
to do your dirty work?

52:47.539 --> 52:49.083
Must be getting old, Kano.

52:49.750 --> 52:50.584
Zip it.

52:50.793 --> 52:54.421
P.U.P. really needs to invest
in a security system.

52:54.505 --> 52:57.049
We should beat it before somebody sees us.

52:57.716 --> 53:00.511
You picked a bad day
to rub me the wrong way.

53:18.570 --> 53:19.405
Scrappy?

53:19.780 --> 53:20.614
Anyone?

53:22.282 --> 53:23.117
Hello?

53:47.474 --> 53:48.600
See you tomorrow.

53:53.147 --> 53:56.483
Look what I got.

53:58.777 --> 54:01.655
- New fish, guys.
- New fish, guys.

54:04.450 --> 54:09.079
Excuse me, this is no way to treat a lady.
Where are your manners?

54:09.663 --> 54:11.415
I left them in the junkyard.

54:11.498 --> 54:15.377
Blimey, don't you yanks know
how to make a decent cup of tea?

54:15.461 --> 54:16.503
Of course.

54:16.795 --> 54:18.380
One lump or two?

54:18.464 --> 54:21.383
You're in big trouble
when our dad finds out, man.

54:21.550 --> 54:25.304
- He's a human catcher.
- And he's 50 feet tall and...

54:25.387 --> 54:28.056
Ooh. I'm shaking in my paws.

54:28.140 --> 54:30.601
Pick on someone your own size.

54:30.684 --> 54:33.729
And how is everyone enjoying their stay?
Hmm?

54:33.812 --> 54:36.648
Classy joint, Bark. Kind of suits you.

54:37.191 --> 54:38.192
Prison chic.

54:38.609 --> 54:40.736
You can't keep us here forever.

54:40.819 --> 54:45.782
Uh, I'm sorry, maybe you missed this,
but you're in a prison. My prison.

54:46.575 --> 54:50.037
It's designed to keep people in
or keep them out.

54:50.704 --> 54:54.500
What's your scam this time, Bark?
You're not even on <i>Pup Star.</i>

55:08.347 --> 55:10.349
You're whack, Bark.

55:10.432 --> 55:15.145
Tiny's so smitten with Julio, she'll vote
for him in a beat of her sappy heart.

55:15.229 --> 55:18.732
If judges know what's good for them,
they'll do the same.

55:18.815 --> 55:20.234
- Not cool.
- Not cool.

55:20.317 --> 55:24.112
And with no Scrappy to compete,
I win <i>Pup Star.</i>

55:24.404 --> 55:28.242
As Julio, for now.
But I'll control the hearts and minds

55:28.325 --> 55:32.496

that believe <i>Pup Star</i> is real.

55:32.579 --> 55:34.039
Suckers.

55:34.122 --> 55:35.499
Oh, my dawg!

55:37.376 --> 55:40.128
This is Arf. He's your doppelganger, boss.

55:40.212 --> 55:42.756
Hi, Bark.
Happy to be part of the mean team.

55:42.839 --> 55:45.717
All right, Arf.
If there's a surprise inspection,

55:45.801 --> 55:48.804
keep your mouth shut
and try to look regal. Like me.

55:48.887 --> 55:50.681
Regal, got it.

55:50.973 --> 55:53.600
Oh. Uh, one thing. This collar?

55:54.059 --> 55:56.603
I like collars normally,
I'm a fashionista.

55:56.687 --> 55:58.897
- Okay.
- They emphasize my strong neck

55:58.981 --> 56:02.192
and lumberjack ruff.
Which pups say is my best feature.

56:02.276 --> 56:04.987
- Cut to the chase.
- But this collar pinches.

56:05.070 --> 56:06.947
This better be going somewhere.

56:07.030 --> 56:08.365
Tight, metal, clampy?

56:08.782 --> 56:11.368
Nobody's doing this look right now. So...

56:11.451 --> 56:13.745
Yeah, loose lips sink ships.

56:13.829 --> 56:16.081
- Zap him.
- I'm not vibing it.

56:19.042 --> 56:20.877
Okay, okay, zipping it!

56:21.253 --> 56:23.797
Mum's the word.
Is this really necessary?

56:23.880 --> 56:27.384
Completely.
If he opens his mouth, zap him again.

56:27.467 --> 56:30.220
This is giving me agita.

56:30.804 --> 56:32.764
Kano and I will go to the finale.

56:32.848 --> 56:36.977
Roland, you make sure
our darling family members stay put.

56:39.313 --> 56:43.233
Make sure this bozo doesn't do
anything stupid, like, I don't know,

56:43.317 --> 56:45.944
- letting the dogs out.
- Words hurt, Kano.

56:46.028 --> 56:48.071
You can count on me, boss.

56:57.497 --> 57:00.792
Yo, tough guy!
Let's take this outside, paw to paw!

57:08.759 --> 57:10.969
Team Tiny, you're up in 30 seconds.

58:05.899 --> 58:07.609
Julio, are you okay?

58:18.996 --> 58:20.372
I brought the honey.

58:54.781 --> 58:59.161
No, no, no. Just checking on all of this.

58:59.244 --> 59:02.497
Heh. Looks to be in order.
I'll just be going.

59:02.581 --> 59:04.041

59:08.712 --> 59:11.840
- Any sign of Miss Scrappy?
- No, and something's wrong.

59:11.923 --> 59:14.676
The studio was empty.
The back door was open.

59:14.760 --> 59:17.429
That was a weird incident on stage
with Julio.

59:17.679 --> 59:20.599
His singing voice changed.
It was bizarre.

59:20.682 --> 59:25.103

in the shower a while ago. Listen.

Oh, this? I found it on the floor
of Julio's bedroom,

59:36.782 --> 59:40.202
next to his dirty underwear.
I figured it was garbage,

59:40.285 --> 59:42.662
so I kept it maybe as a souvenir.

59:43.205 --> 59:45.248
- Maybe.

Yeah. In your dreams, Roland.

01:00:24.162 --> 01:00:27.207

Hey, warden!

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:36.842
We got some suits out front
from some accounting team.

01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:40.053

about a surprise audit? Uh...

- Is that bad?
- Everybody get in your cells!

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:45.559
- Everybody in your cells!
- Okay.

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:50.355
I'm gonna get changed and go meet them.
Clean out this room and get Arf in here.

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:54.818

Oh, right.

01:01:02.534 --> 01:01:04.870
Oh, man! I don't wanna go back.

Whoa.

01:01:40.155 --> 01:01:42.949
Is that Scrappy? The famous rapper?

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:45.827
What? You know
another rapping Yorkie, po-po?

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:49.664
- What's it to you?
- I've been known to throw some rhymes.

01:01:49.748 --> 01:01:51.917

This is the finale
for Pup Star: World Tour!

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:05.759
Dogs from around the world came.
Judges chose their favorite to mentor

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:09.929
and they're waiting backstage
for their turn to showcase their talent.

01:04:10.013 --> 01:04:13.016

I didn't wanna be that dog.

Ah, nerves.

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:38.833
These are so common among amateurs.

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:40.418

You're awfully cocky tonight.

01:04:43.171 --> 01:04:48.468

for "supremely confident," then yes.

We have one announcement.

01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:58.520
Our defending champion, Scrappy,
has gone missing.

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:01.147
- Ooh.

01:05:01.356 --> 01:05:06.236

01:07:41.849 --> 01:07:43.893
Oh, no, that's not possible.

01:07:44.519 --> 01:07:47.146
It'd make this audit
go very smooth for you.

01:07:54.279 --> 01:07:57.949
Okay. But only under...
No, make that two conditions.

01:07:58.449 --> 01:08:01.869
One, no talking to any of the inmates.

01:08:01.995 --> 01:08:06.082
And two, you ignore
all discretionary audio visual equipment

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:08.459
that fell off the back of a truck.

01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:10.795
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:08:10.878 --> 01:08:12.255
Okay.

01:08:14.132 --> 01:08:16.759
Clyde? Door, please.

01:08:16.843 --> 01:08:19.970
Follow me.
Stay inside the yellow lines, please.

01:08:20.138 --> 01:08:23.224
Now, I must warn you,
Bark doesn't like to talk.

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:25.059
Prison will do that to a dog.

01:08:26.603 --> 01:08:28.354
Hey! What's going on here?

01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:31.608
Get those dogs back in their cells.

01:08:31.691 --> 01:08:34.569
We're fine where we are, warden.

01:08:34.652 --> 01:08:37.654
Yeah, the funny thing is,
not like ha-ha funny,

01:08:37.863 --> 01:08:40.617
but like hmm funny
is that we're in charge now.

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:44.912
We don't wanna take orders
from no spray-tan jabroni no mores.

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:49.792
Well, seems like it's a bit
of a sticky wicket, isn't it?

01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:53.254
- Meatball.
- Let the pups go free, mon.

01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:59.051
Day late and a dollar short.
No holding back the power of rap.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.390
Uh...

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:08.394
Looks like you gots a mutiny on your paws.

01:09:13.608 --> 01:09:14.442
Mama?

01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:20.740
Now we be jamming, mon,
with Team Gnarly and Mobo.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.450
Buyaka, buyaka!

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:23.618

Ah. Yeah, it wasn't good for you.

01:10:18.297 --> 01:10:19.132
Yeah.

01:10:19.465 --> 01:10:24.345
Well, let me remind you
that you are in a heavily guarded prison.

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:27.807
My prison. And there is no escape.

01:10:28.015 --> 01:10:30.268
I'm guessing there's a secret way out.

01:10:31.269 --> 01:10:33.688
No. Why would you think that?

No, don't touch that! Don't do that!

- No, no, no.

01:10:48.286 --> 01:10:53.166
- Can you guys keep an eye on Bark's crew?
- Don't worry, I can handle these fellas.

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:54.709
I'm from Jersey.

01:10:54.792 --> 01:10:55.918
Unlike this muppet,

01:10:56.002 --> 01:10:59.005
I happen to know a thing or two
about keeping order.

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:00.339

01:12:50.741 --> 01:12:52.785
- Oh, no.
- Start flexing, P.U.P.

01:12:52.994 --> 01:12:56.539

- Uh, sure, Scraps.

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:04.005

01:13:04.171 --> 01:13:05.089
This.

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:09.051
Ida, you know how to drive one?

01:13:09.135 --> 01:13:13.097
Of course. Back home in Mexico,
I was a tank driver for the army.

01:13:15.349 --> 01:13:16.809
And I was the best.

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:19.103
Okay. Looks like we got a ride, guys.

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:21.105
It's time to bail on this jail.

I think Tiny is onto me.

01:14:51.278 --> 01:14:55.783
Do you wanna be a local soap star,
or a world-renowned Pup Star?

- Now get out there and do your job.
- And shake your bon-bons

01:15:17.972 --> 01:15:20.016
- Bark, he's making...
- Oh, do tell.

01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:21.517
Bark has what?

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:28.149
This is what's become of the hack parade.
You lost the brightest star you had

01:15:28.232 --> 01:15:30.860
- when you kicked me off.
- What are you doing?

01:15:30.943 --> 01:15:33.154
Ask them. They're all in on it.

01:15:33.237 --> 01:15:35.281
You're in on what?

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:38.200
Bark dognapped our families.

01:15:38.284 --> 01:15:41.579
Yeah, man.
We been instructed to vote for Julio or...

01:15:41.662 --> 01:15:44.040
Or it's curtains for all of them.

01:15:44.123 --> 01:15:49.295
You really should pay more attention.
Thought you'd remember these dulcet tones.

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:51.672
Julio, you're part of this, too?

01:15:51.756 --> 01:15:55.551
Let's just say fame has a price,
and I'm willing to pay it.

01:15:55.676 --> 01:15:59.346
You'll vote for him, too,
if you wanna see your sister again.

01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:01.432

I was merely a pawn in this scheme.

01:18:22.072 --> 01:18:24.116
I'll be back. Just wait and see.

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:27.328
This time next year,
I'll have my own reality show.

01:18:29.997 --> 01:18:33.292
No. No, please!
I'm too famous to go to jail.

01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:36.921
And too lazy for community service.
Please, no!

01:18:37.004 --> 01:18:39.089
Come on, move it short stuff.

01:18:39.173 --> 01:18:40.591
Off you go, Julio.

01:18:40.674 --> 01:18:43.344
Yeah, toddle on back to obscurity.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:46.597
Patch us into the prison.

01:18:47.848 --> 01:18:48.849
<i>Are we on?</i>

01:18:48.933 --> 01:18:51.185
<i>Am I FaceSkyping yet?</i>

01:18:51.268 --> 01:18:53.938
You're on, Mama. Are you okay?

01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:58.609
<i>Oh, yes.
They came around with a good talking to.</i>

01:18:58.776 --> 01:19:02.071
<i>And I met this nice gentlemen, Butch.</i>

01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:03.489
<i>Hey, kiddo.</i>

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:05.699
<i>Say hi to your new stepdad.</i>

01:19:06.033 --> 01:19:07.785
A match made in prison?

01:19:07.952 --> 01:19:10.913
That's not gonna be easy
to explain to the rellis'.

01:19:10.996 --> 01:19:15.668
I'm so sorry, Your Highness, that
you're so embarrassed by your own mother.

01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:17.795
Again with the guilt trip.

01:19:17.878 --> 01:19:20.547
<i>Dad. Check out our funny new game.</i>

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:21.757
<i>Dance!</i>

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.259
<i>No! Never!</i>

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:25.678
<i>Do it.</i>

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:27.638
Ooh.

01:19:32.685 --> 01:19:36.146
That's my pups, man.
Always looking on the bright side.

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:40.192
Grandpa!

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:43.904
- Oh, you old rascal, are you all right?
- <i>Hello, lad.</i>

01:19:43.988 --> 01:19:46.490
Just playing cribbage
with me new mates.

01:19:46.573 --> 01:19:51.203
Well, like you always say, Grandpa,
no one makes friends like a Growl.

01:19:51.745 --> 01:19:56.083
Well, I'm sorry, you never know
what's gonna happen on live television,

01:19:56.166 --> 01:19:58.085
but, sadly, my producer tells me

01:19:58.168 --> 01:20:01.588
we will not be able to crown a champion
this year.

01:20:04.425 --> 01:20:05.301
Wait a second.

01:20:05.676 --> 01:20:09.471
We can't let the actions of a few bad dogs
like Bark and Julio

01:20:09.847 --> 01:20:11.890
destroy the purity of <i>Pup Star.</i>

01:20:11.974 --> 01:20:12.850
Hear, hear!

01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:16.103
If there's one thing I can't abide,
it's cynicism.

01:20:16.186 --> 01:20:19.732
Bad dogs like Bark
are willing to do anything to be famous.

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:21.608
But <i>Pup Star's</i> not about that.

01:20:21.692 --> 01:20:24.987
Music is the universal language
that brings us together.

01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:28.949
- Preach it, sister.
- We came here because we wanted to sing,

01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:31.869
and to make people happy
all over the world.

01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:35.039
That's what <i>Pup Star</i> is really about.

01:20:35.622 --> 01:20:38.042
We all in this together, man. One love!

01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:43.130
Raj, Mobo, Ming, and Scrappy
have all worked so hard to get here.

01:20:43.464 --> 01:20:44.465
The contestants,

01:20:44.548 --> 01:20:45.716
the judges,

01:20:45.924 --> 01:20:46.759
the audience.

01:20:47.885 --> 01:20:50.220
We have to let our voices be heard.

01:20:50.304 --> 01:20:57.227
We are one pack, one voice,
one world singing together in harmony.

01:20:57.561 --> 01:21:00.522
Yeah! Everybody get in on this jam!

01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:02.274
Hey, wait for us.

01:21:02.608 --> 01:21:04.568
