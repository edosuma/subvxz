00:54.400 --> 00:55.959
I never saw this land
when it was green.

00:58.001 --> 01:00.666
My father did.

01:00.667 --> 01:04.066
He worked it before
the drought came.

01:04.066 --> 01:07.499
He used to talk about
it all the time.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.566
He used to talk about the
wheat they grew and the

01:10.567 --> 01:13.899
pride they felt.

01:13.900 --> 01:16.899
He always believed
in the land.

01:16.900 --> 01:20.000
Even as the fights over
water first divided states,

01:20.001 --> 01:26.598
then towns, and then
neighbors, most people who
could, left.

01:27.335 --> 01:28.694
But he had his
reasons for staying.

01:31.569 --> 01:34.967
He was convinced the
land would come back.

01:34.968 --> 01:37.768
It just needed water.

01:37.769 --> 01:40.300
And he was right.

01:58.902 --> 02:00.969
Ahh!

02:02.569 --> 02:03.869
Oh!

02:08.936 --> 02:11.669
Uhh, uhh...

02:13.404 --> 02:15.302
No no
no no no no no no no!

02:24.472 --> 02:25.902
<i>You killed him!</i>

02:29.305 --> 02:30.737
Get away from him!

02:30.738 --> 02:32.736
You killed him!

02:32.737 --> 02:34.902
I gotta go to the bathroom.

02:34.903 --> 02:37.469
You don't turn forward,
I'm going to have to cut you
down.

02:37.470 --> 02:39.970
I gotta piss!

02:41.437 --> 02:43.595
If I don't take it out and
go I'm gonna go in my pants!

02:45.204 --> 02:46.204
Do not move your arms!

02:49.472 --> 02:50.790
Now you tell me
where you're from!

02:52.406 --> 02:54.305
They said there's
water here.

02:54.306 --> 02:56.006
Who said?

02:56.007 --> 02:57.771
Which direction
you come from?

02:57.772 --> 02:59.729
At the blacktop, we went
right, so two days to the

03:01.237 --> 03:03.304
left I guess.

03:03.305 --> 03:03.503
Gray bell?

03:04.272 --> 03:06.172
No way!

03:06.172 --> 03:07.604
Caddy.

03:07.605 --> 03:09.472
Turn around slow.

03:09.473 --> 03:11.738
Beautiful, this way.

03:11.739 --> 03:13.172
Hell...

03:13.173 --> 03:16.338
You ain't gonna
shoot me in the back.

03:20.007 --> 03:22.138
What's left in caddy?

03:22.139 --> 03:23.418
Oh god damn it
I'm peeing myself!

03:27.272 --> 03:29.110
I'm just gonna have to
stink now until I can...

03:37.374 --> 03:39.406
Kill him?

03:40.973 --> 03:42.007
You hit Ernest?

03:47.275 --> 03:48.673
Stay there!

03:48.674 --> 03:49.673
Shovel?

03:54.441 --> 03:56.406
I'll get it.

04:07.008 --> 04:09.641
You should've let
me help you Ernest.

04:09.642 --> 04:12.407
I'm not scared.

04:12.408 --> 04:14.108
How do you spell your name?

04:14.109 --> 04:15.608
What?

04:15.609 --> 04:16.341
Your name.

04:16.341 --> 04:17.642
How do you spell it?

04:17.642 --> 04:18.642
J-e-r-o-m-e.

04:21.108 --> 04:22.075
Jerome.

04:22.076 --> 04:22.942
Mm.

04:22.943 --> 04:26.007
Maybe you're
more of a Jerry.

04:26.008 --> 04:27.008
I don't like that.

04:27.009 --> 04:28.341
No?

04:28.342 --> 04:30.574
Then why you call me Ernest?

04:33.842 --> 04:34.874
'Cause that's your name.

04:38.676 --> 04:41.908
Well I'd prefer if
you stuck with dad.

05:07.610 --> 05:08.729
Can't call it
a well no more.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.510
Should we go back?

05:12.810 --> 05:14.776
She'll make it.

05:16.578 --> 05:18.977
<i>First they took
your water, then they</i>

05:18.978 --> 05:20.975
<i>took your land, and next
they'll take your car, and</i>

05:24.078 --> 05:26.195
<i>when they do, just come on
down and buy another one at</i>

05:28.678 --> 05:31.243
<i>Calvin hoyman auto machines.</i>

05:31.244 --> 05:33.443
<i>Where the vehicles vary, but the
deals are all the same!</i>

05:36.345 --> 05:38.624
<i>Voice of the west shortwave,
where the airwaves live free.</i>

05:41.911 --> 05:43.811
<i>This week after months
of stalemate, many of the</i>

05:43.812 --> 05:46.178
<i>state's water projects
resumed operation, after</i>

05:46.179 --> 05:48.579
<i>agreeing to
federal oversight.</i>

05:48.580 --> 05:52.012
<i>Good they're drilling again,
but who's going to get the
water?</i>

05:52.013 --> 05:55.678
<i>From the vista, all I can see
is industrial farms benefit.</i>

05:55.679 --> 05:56.838
<i>I'm just a small
local farmer!</i>

05:58.479 --> 06:00.178
<i>Chuck wagon coming in boys!</i>

06:02.246 --> 06:03.578
<i>Yee-hoo!</i>

06:05.213 --> 06:07.646
Remember Jerome, when we get
to the top, you stay close

06:10.513 --> 06:11.846
and let me do the talking.

06:11.847 --> 06:13.245
These men are animals.

06:13.246 --> 06:15.346
You've got no
business with them.

06:15.347 --> 06:18.379
We'll deliver the rations
and booze and get the hell
out of there.

06:22.747 --> 06:24.512
Did my nicotine
patches come in?

06:24.513 --> 06:25.346
Not yet.

06:25.347 --> 06:28.014
Maybe next time.

06:28.015 --> 06:30.279
Oh.

06:30.280 --> 06:31.313
That's nice.

06:31.314 --> 06:32.980
Yeah, alright.

06:32.981 --> 06:34.346
Nice and crisp.

06:34.347 --> 06:35.846
Very well made.

06:36.681 --> 06:39.482
Thought you went
straightedge.

06:41.615 --> 06:42.946
You fall off the wagon?

06:42.947 --> 06:43.913
I sell it.

06:43.914 --> 06:45.279
Ah.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.580
You know what all these
supplies'd fetch you at the

06:46.581 --> 06:48.848
border?

06:48.849 --> 06:50.487
Few trips of your loads
and we all retire.

06:52.615 --> 06:55.314
Then what would you eat?

06:55.315 --> 06:57.353
Like you said, evaluating
the food or magazines, you

07:00.948 --> 07:04.348
must've done something
shady to get this detail.

07:04.349 --> 07:05.914
I got a donkey.

07:07.449 --> 07:10.116
You think that's
gonna cut it?

07:10.117 --> 07:12.515
Hey Caleb, I was hoping I could
talk to you about this water.

07:14.416 --> 07:16.334
If it's not heading towards
us, where's it going?

07:19.249 --> 07:20.915
We just got to reroute
it around your little

07:20.916 --> 07:22.648
subsistence farms.

07:22.649 --> 07:25.982
Irrigate the
commercial crop.

07:25.983 --> 07:27.914
You sound like
you're proud of it.

07:27.915 --> 07:30.082
I'm proud of hard work.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.682
A job's a job, Ernest.

07:31.683 --> 07:33.950
And you better remember that
if you want to keep yours

07:33.951 --> 07:36.116
delivering supplies to us.

07:36.117 --> 07:38.448
My land's fertile,
it's just dry.

07:39.283 --> 07:40.649
Hoo boy!

07:40.650 --> 07:42.415
We know how much
you hate being dry.

07:43.783 --> 07:45.682
You just worry about getting
those supplies up here.

07:45.683 --> 07:48.150
Let us worry about
where the water goes.

07:59.118 --> 08:00.117
Ho!

08:06.517 --> 08:08.416
Oh, geez.

08:12.119 --> 08:12.950
Woah, woah, woah.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.984
Shh.

08:42.653 --> 08:43.485
I'm sorry.

08:43.486 --> 08:44.719
No, it's okay.

08:48.154 --> 08:49.552
That should never
be a shame to you.

08:52.754 --> 08:55.185
I could've done it.

08:57.687 --> 08:59.753
I know you could.

09:28.988 --> 09:30.820
Close your eyes.

09:30.821 --> 09:32.179
Hamburger, French
fries and a coke.

09:34.121 --> 09:36.587
These were hard to get.

09:36.588 --> 09:38.921
Keep them closed!

09:47.656 --> 09:48.656
What've you got for dad?

09:51.256 --> 09:52.695
Jerome got the last
burger and fries.

09:53.857 --> 09:56.821
That one's lasagna
and this one's...

09:56.823 --> 09:58.322
Yours.

10:07.256 --> 10:08.156
<i>There's something going now,</i>

10:08.157 --> 10:10.822
<i>and the crowd is
loving it.</i>

10:10.823 --> 10:13.589
<i>It's the bottom of the 8th
inning, and so far it's been</i>

10:13.590 --> 10:16.522
<i>a very tight game.</i>

10:16.523 --> 10:20.657
<i>Two outs with a runner
on first base...</i>

10:27.457 --> 10:29.956
Gonna go see momma
tomorrow after the auction.

10:29.957 --> 10:31.491
I know she'd
love to see you.

10:32.058 --> 10:34.956
You were empty handed.

10:37.090 --> 10:40.025
Any luck with that fabric
I asked you to look for?

10:42.058 --> 10:43.424
Been lean, honey.

10:44.258 --> 10:46.657
Nothing to trade.

10:50.125 --> 10:52.391
I won't even ask
about the earrings.

11:00.492 --> 11:03.591
Hey Mary.

11:03.592 --> 11:06.691
You could listen to
something else tonight.

11:06.692 --> 11:12.525
I'm too tired, and I'm going
to skip momma tomorrow.

11:20.992 --> 11:22.792
<i>A skirmish between state
militiamen and</i>

11:22.793 --> 11:26.525
<i>border settlers resulted in
two settler casualties today.</i>

11:26.526 --> 11:28.825
<i>A state militia spokesman
reiterate the group's</i>

11:28.826 --> 11:30.992
<i>commitment to its water
rights agreements, but</i>

11:30.993 --> 11:33.425
<i>condemned what they termed
"terroristic oppression"</i>

11:33.426 --> 11:36.426
<i>against farmers by these
growing settler groups.</i>

11:36.427 --> 11:38.826
<i>Sanctions are the only
pressure that will bring the</i>

11:38.827 --> 11:40.360
<i>state back.</i>

11:40.361 --> 11:42.126
<i>Washington knows this.</i>

11:42.127 --> 11:45.327
<i>If people live long enough
without TV, Internet...</i>

11:45.328 --> 11:48.326
<i>Fresh food, education,
they'll look to their state</i>

11:48.328 --> 11:50.459
<i>leadership and change.</i>

12:04.863 --> 12:05.661
Mary?

12:05.662 --> 12:06.827
Mary!

12:07.696 --> 12:08.694
Mary!

12:16.928 --> 12:19.227
Lot to do tomorrow.

12:19.228 --> 12:20.227
Yeah.

12:20.994 --> 12:21.994
No, leave that one open.

12:29.829 --> 12:33.495

12:48.362 --> 12:49.962
Selling starts in two
minutes, not three.

12:52.963 --> 12:55.197
Ladies and gentlemen, one
day the water is going to

12:55.198 --> 12:56.529
come back.

12:56.530 --> 12:58.529
It is the reason we have
all stayed behind in this

12:58.530 --> 13:00.462
god-forsaken land.

13:00.463 --> 13:03.463
It's not hope, it's
certainty, and when that day

13:03.464 --> 13:06.797
comes, you are going
to need this equipment.

13:06.798 --> 13:10.430

and when the rains come, it

13:10.431 --> 13:12.469
will make you the kings and
queens you know you are.

13:15.130 --> 13:17.929
Fortune favors the bold,
ladies and gentlemen.

13:17.931 --> 13:21.597
Fortune favors the bold.

14:29.968 --> 14:32.134
That's quite an upgrade
from that donkey.

14:32.135 --> 14:34.299
Guess you can keep that
supply detail, Ernest.

14:34.300 --> 14:35.932
Thank you flemmon.

14:35.934 --> 14:37.833
...a beautiful
semia autoseeder.

14:37.834 --> 14:39.966
These steel giants are the last
of the...

14:39.967 --> 14:41.134
You know what debt is?

14:41.135 --> 14:42.334
Yeah.

14:42.335 --> 14:44.966
I just got more of it.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.267
This is the last of it.

14:46.268 --> 14:48.001
Is it worth it?

14:48.002 --> 14:48.801
It has to be.

14:48.802 --> 14:50.200
Yeah.

14:50.201 --> 14:51.202
Ready to show momma?

14:53.435 --> 14:54.714
Just don't tell
her what it cost.

15:16.703 --> 15:18.269
Look at what your
son brought you.

16:23.939 --> 16:24.871
Is that Robbie?

16:24.872 --> 16:26.005
That's Robbie.

16:26.006 --> 16:28.871
Using that baby
to get handouts.

16:28.872 --> 16:30.537
Vultures.

16:30.538 --> 16:31.470
Yo!

16:31.471 --> 16:32.771
Ernest!

16:32.772 --> 16:34.104
Ernest!

16:34.105 --> 16:37.671
Hey it's me, it's Robbie!

Special occasion, Ernest?

My well finally ran dry.

17:00.507 --> 17:01.873
Condolences.

17:01.874 --> 17:03.139
Pray for rain.

17:03.140 --> 17:05.040
Pray for rain.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.040
Stop!

17:06.474 --> 17:07.638
Water for the baby!

17:07.640 --> 17:08.940
Stop!

17:13.373 --> 17:14.607
It's alright, baby.

17:14.608 --> 17:16.740
Come here.

17:20.209 --> 17:23.773
You could adopt
us both, Ernest.

17:23.775 --> 17:25.292
I'd take you if I
could feed you, sooz.

17:27.776 --> 17:30.306
Robbie thinks we
should sell the baby.

17:34.076 --> 17:35.674
Tastes like lemons,
but smells like shit.

17:38.842 --> 17:40.441
What's that, Robbie?

17:40.442 --> 17:42.840
He says your sister tastes like
lemons, but smells like shit.

17:44.809 --> 17:47.275
And that's a shh....

17:47.276 --> 17:48.474
Who said that?

17:48.475 --> 17:50.142
Uh, your sister's boyfriend.

17:50.143 --> 17:52.142
Hey, Robbie, you need
to take your baby to see

17:52.143 --> 17:53.540
Dr. coles, okay?

17:53.541 --> 17:55.541
Tell him I'll pay
for it when I can.

17:55.542 --> 17:56.876
Gotcha.

17:56.877 --> 17:58.474
Look, I don't want you
bringing sooz and the baby

17:58.474 --> 18:00.008
out here, using
them as bait.

18:00.009 --> 18:01.176
Okay?

18:01.177 --> 18:03.142
And no bullshit about
selling that baby.

18:03.143 --> 18:05.375
You need water,
you come see me.

18:05.376 --> 18:06.043
Okay.

18:06.045 --> 18:07.875
Hey Jerome boy.

18:07.876 --> 18:11.410
You just tell your sister
Mary I like lemons.

18:23.476 --> 18:26.410
So that's where all
the money goes.

18:37.011 --> 18:38.511
I need to borrow
that machine.

18:38.512 --> 18:40.110
What for?

18:40.111 --> 18:42.511
You two boxed me
out of that auction.

18:42.512 --> 18:43.878
That's a cheat.

18:43.879 --> 18:45.778
Well, you should talk to
your father about that.

18:45.779 --> 18:47.710
He sold it to me.

18:47.711 --> 18:50.343
If you ain't borrowing it
out, I need to rent it.

18:50.344 --> 18:51.377
When about?

18:51.378 --> 18:53.643
Right now. How much?

18:53.644 --> 18:56.412
You okay?

18:59.544 --> 19:01.211
What's going on with you?

19:01.212 --> 19:02.211
I just need the machine.

19:04.212 --> 19:05.211
Alright.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.545
I tell you what.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.145
You get your father to
guarantee you I'll let you

19:08.146 --> 19:10.345
use it whenever
you want for free.

19:10.346 --> 19:12.545
Except the days
we're using it.

19:12.546 --> 19:15.778
You can radio him from
the ten meter right now.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.112
What, you don't trust me?

19:18.113 --> 19:20.546
What if I buy you
a couple of drinks?

19:20.547 --> 19:22.345
You always help everyone
else around here.

19:22.346 --> 19:24.279
What you got for me?

19:24.280 --> 19:25.279
Sympathy.

19:27.347 --> 19:28.479
It's getting late.

19:29.480 --> 19:30.546
I'm gonna wish you
well, Flemming.

19:30.547 --> 19:32.479
I would've been happy
to help you out.

19:32.480 --> 19:33.713
Let's see you ride away now.

19:33.714 --> 19:34.780
Let me run your route.

19:34.781 --> 19:36.613
I can talk to Caleb
and those men.

19:36.614 --> 19:40.347
You can apply for the job,
just like anybody else.

19:40.348 --> 19:42.279
You don't have what it takes
to convince those watermen

19:42.280 --> 19:45.080
to irrigate this land.

19:48.515 --> 19:51.380
Your kids know what
you did to your wife?

19:51.381 --> 19:53.080
Fuckin' drunk.

20:05.947 --> 20:07.349
<i>Nthe surgeon general has issued a</i>

20:07.350 --> 20:09.946
<i>statement about fertility
rates in urban cities</i>

20:09.947 --> 20:12.280
<i>dropping for the
seventh year in a row.</i>

20:12.281 --> 20:15.615
<i>What we believed was a
social correlation between</i>

20:15.616 --> 20:17.694
<i>urbanites is now a proven
biological, though we don't</i>

20:21.115 --> 20:23.281
<i>yet know all of the factors.</i>

20:23.282 --> 20:25.682
<i>It is not that...</i>

20:35.449 --> 20:37.550
I'd like to talk to
you about an offer.

20:37.551 --> 20:39.707
See if I can get you to run
that water line out my way.

20:41.815 --> 20:43.948
Come on.

21:09.850 --> 21:12.983
I'll miss this water well.

21:13.950 --> 21:16.316
What'd they say?

21:19.117 --> 21:21.151
Uhh.

21:21.152 --> 21:23.817
Well when it rains,
they'll see what we have.

21:23.818 --> 21:26.352
When it rains...

21:41.185 --> 21:44.052
Eh, it's just this
dust in my throat.

21:44.053 --> 21:44.984
Don't worry
about me, Ernest.

21:44.985 --> 21:46.851
I want you to have it.

21:54.385 --> 21:56.952
I never worry about you.

21:56.953 --> 22:00.218
I worry about your sister.

22:00.219 --> 22:03.285
I worry about Mary's
life, not yours.

22:03.286 --> 22:05.205
On a prayer, if any deer or
elk looking for water

22:07.020 --> 22:09.317
tonight, they'll stray
through here, snip out the

22:09.318 --> 22:10.878
pump, fall through
the plastic, and bam.

22:13.786 --> 22:16.219
Catch 'em in this trap!

22:16.220 --> 22:18.886
Think how good
that'll taste, right?

22:18.887 --> 22:21.120
Bring me some scraps.

22:27.054 --> 22:30.520
Did I tell you I think
I met a girl you'd like?

22:30.521 --> 22:32.219
Last time I
crossed the border?

22:32.220 --> 22:32.852
Yeah?

22:32.853 --> 22:33.852
Yeah.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.788
She might be a bit
older than you.

22:35.789 --> 22:38.353
That a problem?

22:38.354 --> 22:39.394
I told this one about you.

22:40.523 --> 22:41.887
Her eyes went all...

22:41.888 --> 22:43.888
Mmm.

22:43.889 --> 22:44.888
Yeah.

22:46.688 --> 22:48.854
I get hunches
on these things.

22:49.854 --> 22:52.251
I don't think I
have time for women.

22:53.122 --> 22:56.321
You're too busy for women?

22:56.322 --> 22:58.854
You too busy for friends?

22:58.855 --> 23:00.220
I don't see
much of them around.

23:00.221 --> 23:01.721
There's plenty
of kids out here.

23:01.722 --> 23:04.020
What about your friends?

23:04.021 --> 23:05.421
I had 'em.

23:05.422 --> 23:06.621
I had 'em.

23:09.488 --> 23:11.687
Long as I don't get on your
nerves, I prefer to hang out

23:12.990 --> 23:14.055
with you.

23:14.056 --> 23:16.156
Shit!

23:16.890 --> 23:17.889
Trap works.

23:18.823 --> 23:20.022
Little help?

23:20.023 --> 23:21.022
Thanks.

23:21.991 --> 23:23.388
Woah!

23:24.657 --> 23:26.288
Show me!

23:26.289 --> 23:27.121
Keep your hands up.

23:27.122 --> 23:29.121
Ooh!

23:29.122 --> 23:29.723
Good!

23:29.724 --> 23:30.723
Good!

23:31.357 --> 23:32.723
Good, that...

23:32.724 --> 23:34.555
Ragh!

23:37.022 --> 23:37.989
Yeah, that's all I'm saying.

23:37.990 --> 23:40.190
You don't gotta marry her.

23:40.191 --> 23:42.628
You don't want to wait around
thinking something's gonna come.

23:45.224 --> 23:47.189
Waiting's a fucking disese.

23:47.190 --> 23:50.690
Think something,
feel something?

23:50.691 --> 23:52.290
You should do something!

23:52.291 --> 23:53.323
Alright?

24:03.825 --> 24:05.758
What's she like?

24:07.756 --> 24:10.634
Well, she's got ears that
poke through her hair.

I don't want you seeing that

24:55.827 --> 24:57.427
want any more lies.

24:57.428 --> 24:59.625
I could walk
right out of here.

25:00.393 --> 25:01.659
You can't keep me.

25:01.660 --> 25:03.793
No I can't.

25:03.794 --> 25:07.727
But I don't, 'cause
you're making me a liar!

25:09.626 --> 25:13.192
The lying is up to you.

25:13.228 --> 25:15.126
Maybe I want a secret.

25:15.128 --> 25:17.245
Whatever you're angry about,
you're angry at yourself.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.560
Maybe you're
right about that.

25:20.561 --> 25:21.994
I know I'm right.

25:21.994 --> 25:24.552
Flem says failures
give the most advice.

25:26.128 --> 25:27.527
Is that what you think?

25:28.860 --> 25:30.629
I don't know anymore.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.660
Well even if that's true,
it's not going to change how

25:32.661 --> 25:34.161
things are in this house.

25:34.162 --> 25:36.162
If you're here, you
gotta stay here.

25:36.163 --> 25:37.894
Why punish me
for being happy?

25:37.895 --> 25:40.462
It's not punishment.,
it's protection.

25:40.464 --> 25:42.562
But it makes me hate you!

25:42.563 --> 25:45.028
Do you feel anything
when I say that?

25:45.029 --> 25:46.661
I hate you!

25:46.662 --> 25:48.394
I love him!

26:10.031 --> 26:11.063
What's wrong?

26:11.064 --> 26:12.228
What happened?

26:12.229 --> 26:13.862
What happened?

26:13.863 --> 26:15.429
I need money!

26:16.763 --> 26:18.729
I'm leaving!

26:21.296 --> 26:23.395
Get away from me!

26:25.230 --> 26:26.029
Give it back to him.

26:26.030 --> 26:27.064
She didn't ask for it.

26:27.065 --> 26:28.063
Give it back to him!

26:28.064 --> 26:29.730
She, she didn't...

26:29.731 --> 26:31.164
You're not going anywhere!

26:32.132 --> 26:32.697
Shh.

26:32.698 --> 26:33.962
I hate you!

26:33.963 --> 26:35.731
What am I supposed to do?

26:35.732 --> 26:38.297
I need him!

26:43.731 --> 26:45.397
Look at our lives!

26:45.398 --> 26:47.364
You failed us!

26:47.365 --> 26:50.864
You failed your family!

28:04.135 --> 28:05.866
Oh no.

28:05.867 --> 28:08.501
The machine!

28:08.502 --> 28:10.300
It's gone!

28:32.968 --> 28:34.702
What did my boy do now?

28:34.703 --> 28:35.702
Nothing, Sam.

28:36.869 --> 28:39.735
I just wanted to finish a
conversation he and I had
started.

28:40.903 --> 28:43.535
You have any luck
with that pipeline?

28:45.804 --> 28:47.203
Nah.

28:47.204 --> 28:49.003
Don't have much
to offer him.

28:50.304 --> 28:52.703
I'm trying to
keep my distance.

28:54.837 --> 28:57.170
Well, that's fallow anyway.

28:57.171 --> 28:58.704
Don't know what's
left of it.

28:58.705 --> 29:00.470
All's is.

29:00.471 --> 29:02.569
I guess I mean to
say it's infertile.

29:02.570 --> 29:06.135
Even if the water comes, I'd
still be stuck running these

29:06.136 --> 29:07.775
bird races and auctions
and what have you.

29:10.437 --> 29:11.876
Don't think Flemming
knows it's dead.

29:13.904 --> 29:16.870
You think he'd work it?

29:16.871 --> 29:19.137
Don't know.

29:19.138 --> 29:22.304
He's obsessed with the land
we've lost, not with the

29:22.305 --> 29:25.472
land we have left.

29:25.472 --> 29:28.004
You know how Flemming
spends his days?

29:28.005 --> 29:30.637
He's got his
self work places.

29:30.638 --> 29:32.504
He went up to the
mountain this morning.

29:32.505 --> 29:34.671
Really?

29:34.672 --> 29:37.304
Says he's on a supply
detail for the water works.

29:37.305 --> 29:39.104
I don't know what that pays.

29:40.871 --> 29:42.571
He come back already?

29:44.906 --> 29:46.406
He took my truck.

31:03.543 --> 31:04.642

31:04.643 --> 31:06.309

31:06.310 --> 31:07.808

31:07.809 --> 31:09.209

31:28.544 --> 31:29.576
Argh!

31:29.577 --> 31:30.576
Raagh!

31:32.811 --> 31:33.810
Don't.

32:48.814 --> 32:51.246
Don't look like an accident.

32:51.247 --> 32:52.366
You drinking too much again?

32:55.146 --> 32:57.346
You're gonna set
this story straight.

32:57.347 --> 32:59.213
What, with Caleb?

32:59.214 --> 33:01.014
No, those watermen
paid me to take it.

33:01.015 --> 33:02.547
There's insurance
money in it.

33:02.548 --> 33:03.313
I'm promising you.

33:03.314 --> 33:04.313
Look, I...

33:04.314 --> 33:06.214
I know you're mad, but...

33:06.215 --> 33:08.047
You've got this wrong.

33:08.048 --> 33:11.081
You don't want to get your
head mixed up over our...

33:11.082 --> 33:13.146
You know, our other problems.

33:13.147 --> 33:14.913
What?

33:14.914 --> 33:16.513
Conflicted interests, no?

33:16.514 --> 33:18.047
Be quiet!

33:18.048 --> 33:20.481
She's a flower.

33:20.482 --> 33:22.998
Someone needs to
appreciate her for more
than cooking and sewing.

33:23.315 --> 33:24.380
Ugh!

33:40.649 --> 33:43.015
Y-you got any water?

33:43.016 --> 33:46.514
There's no water in
these packs, Flemming.

33:46.515 --> 33:50.214
That's the one thing
these men don't need.

33:50.215 --> 33:52.214
There's bottles and bottles
of that spike in there.

33:54.383 --> 33:55.982
It'll make you sick.

33:55.982 --> 33:57.422
You, you can't drown
a fish in water.

34:00.551 --> 34:02.150
We both could use it.

34:02.151 --> 34:03.016
Just a few drops.

34:03.017 --> 34:04.249
Just a taste.

34:04.250 --> 34:05.248
Anything.

34:06.049 --> 34:08.581
I can't go another step.

34:15.248 --> 34:16.916
Turn around.

34:32.552 --> 34:34.250
Get it.

34:41.485 --> 34:43.184
I know that knife.

34:43.185 --> 34:44.650
He'd never sell it.

34:44.650 --> 34:45.810
Came off Caleb
in the scuffle.

34:49.052 --> 34:52.152
I got my licks in.

34:52.152 --> 34:53.918
No doubt.

35:04.785 --> 35:07.386
I'm sorry I took
your machine, Ernest.

35:11.252 --> 35:14.085
I'm...

35:14.086 --> 35:15.485
I'm sorry what I
said the other day.

35:18.520 --> 35:20.799
You're going to find over
time you can't fix what you got.

35:24.020 --> 35:25.986
It's not my fault.

35:25.987 --> 35:27.985
The state took my father's
land and gave it to, uh,

35:29.720 --> 35:31.553
whatever you are.

35:31.554 --> 35:34.286
No resources, no
skills, no money.

35:37.587 --> 35:41.186
And it died.

35:41.187 --> 35:43.920
Why'd they do
that to my father?

35:43.921 --> 35:45.219
'Cause he's from
another state?

35:45.220 --> 35:47.487
'Cause he's smart?

35:47.488 --> 35:49.554
You blame.

35:49.555 --> 35:51.588
You're god damned
right I blame you!

35:51.589 --> 35:53.754
That land was all we had!

36:08.054 --> 36:09.754
I'm leaving.

36:10.754 --> 36:14.431
Those watermen that
paid me were my ticket.

36:16.355 --> 36:17.887
I don't know what they'll
do to you if you return what

36:17.888 --> 36:19.089
they want gone.

36:19.090 --> 36:21.389
I, I wouldn't' go back
with those supplies.

36:21.390 --> 36:22.388
You know about Caleb.

36:22.389 --> 36:24.421
He'll take it out
of me in flesh.

36:24.422 --> 36:26.388
I'm supposed to be halfway
to the border with that gear.

36:26.389 --> 36:27.854
Fetches triple in
the mountain passes.

36:27.855 --> 36:29.488
Anything does.

36:29.489 --> 36:30.989
I swear.

36:30.990 --> 36:33.589
I swear on my daddy's soul.

36:33.590 --> 36:36.089
Those watermen are the
ones to blame for all this.

36:40.191 --> 36:42.222
No, no!

36:42.223 --> 36:43.589
No, look.

36:43.590 --> 36:44.590
You can have half.

36:47.690 --> 36:49.390
Partners.

36:50.390 --> 36:55.665
If you were anyone else I
would've buried you this
morning.

36:57.391 --> 36:59.948
If I were anyone
else, you'd understand.

37:00.591 --> 37:01.589
No.

37:02.524 --> 37:04.456
Let's go.

37:07.524 --> 37:09.256
Let's get you home.

37:09.257 --> 37:12.825
Forget this mess, cut a path,
right aways.

37:15.125 --> 37:16.124
Come on.

37:17.658 --> 37:20.690
Let's go see Caleb.

37:20.691 --> 37:22.848
When you're done with
that bottle, put it on the
ground.

37:25.058 --> 37:27.256
We're not going to make
it in this condition.

37:27.257 --> 37:28.590
Do it!

37:28.591 --> 37:31.424
Ernest, we're too dehydrated
to make it up there.

37:31.425 --> 37:33.225
Kneel down.

37:33.225 --> 37:34.391
Hands...

37:39.726 --> 37:41.925
Hands behind your back.

37:43.493 --> 37:45.559
Ugh!

38:08.227 --> 38:09.226

38:11.993 --> 38:16.308

39:20.429 --> 39:21.628
No way.

39:29.597 --> 39:31.663
We have to hurry before
my dad gets home.

39:54.398 --> 39:56.430
You say a word to daddy, and
I'll burn every last drawing

39:56.431 --> 39:57.497
of yours.

40:21.365 --> 40:22.798
Woo-woop!

40:28.165 --> 40:29.166
Ernest?

40:29.400 --> 40:32.100
Woo-woop!

40:52.034 --> 40:53.232
The kid.

40:53.233 --> 40:54.533
Christ on a crutch.

40:54.534 --> 40:55.366
Jerome.

40:55.367 --> 40:56.499
Is my father with you sirs?

40:56.500 --> 40:58.766
Now Jerome, now
hold on there boy.

40:58.767 --> 41:02.723
Ernest, I, I mean my dad
hasn't come back, and our

41:03.234 --> 41:05.865
machine's over there.

41:05.866 --> 41:07.500
If he's having
any troubles...

41:07.501 --> 41:09.540
I know sometimes, it's hard
for men, so if you could

41:12.735 --> 41:13.967
give this to him.

41:20.102 --> 41:23.335
Jerome boy...

41:23.336 --> 41:25.900
There's been a terrible
accident with that machine.

42:49.839 --> 42:51.159
I took the Liberty
with the truck.

42:53.605 --> 42:55.572
Let's get you both fed.

43:41.241 --> 43:45.174
It's natural to grieve a
loss, stud, but you have to

43:45.175 --> 43:48.742
be careful that your grief
doesn't turn into blame.

43:48.743 --> 43:51.706
Blame is the lazy person's
way of making sense of chaos.

43:55.173 --> 43:57.052
You know, I want to talk
to you about something,

43:57.708 --> 44:00.841
now you're the man.

44:00.842 --> 44:02.600
I know how you feel
about that machine, yeah?

44:04.742 --> 44:05.375
But...

44:06.375 --> 44:08.608
We can both see it's, uh...

44:09.608 --> 44:12.725
I guess what I'm trying to
say is I'm thinking I could

44:12.743 --> 44:15.408
stick with that supply work,
try and get some of that

44:15.409 --> 44:16.742
water down here.

44:16.743 --> 44:18.507
That's not going to happen.

44:18.508 --> 44:20.940
My father tried
a hundred times.

44:20.941 --> 44:23.275
I know, I know.

44:23.276 --> 44:24.042
You're probably right.

44:24.043 --> 44:26.843
I just...

44:26.844 --> 44:29.008
I just figured maybe it just
sort of needs a, you know, a

44:29.009 --> 44:31.375
fresh face.

44:31.376 --> 44:33.676
Maybe we can try
just one more time.

44:33.677 --> 44:35.309
I know you would
never give up.

44:36.477 --> 44:39.774
Well, I'd like to help.

44:41.411 --> 44:44.043
Maybe it'll be a gift.

44:44.044 --> 44:47.280
My gift to you,
my gift to Mary.

44:48.075 --> 44:49.076
My gift to your nephew.

44:51.444 --> 44:52.908
What?

44:52.909 --> 44:54.410
It could be a niece.

44:54.411 --> 44:56.043
I think it's too
small yet to know.

44:58.909 --> 45:00.242
Really?

45:00.411 --> 45:02.609
Yeah.

45:02.610 --> 45:06.008
I've been called a lot of
names but "daddy" ain't one of
them.

45:06.811 --> 45:07.849
She wanted me to tell you.

45:13.845 --> 45:15.776
I really love her, stud.

45:15.777 --> 45:17.776
What do you say?

45:18.879 --> 45:23.311
Imagine what that water
could do for this land.

45:26.911 --> 45:30.910
If you go up there,
don't drink with them.

45:46.545 --> 45:48.778
Must be trying work up here.

45:48.779 --> 45:51.346
Easy to think the loneliness
and isolation could make a

45:51.347 --> 45:53.011
man savage.

45:53.012 --> 45:56.046
And without women
to cut the grease...

45:56.047 --> 45:57.678
Must make you mad.

45:57.679 --> 46:00.846
What would you know
about it, home grown?

46:00.847 --> 46:02.005
Look what you've
accomplished.

46:03.581 --> 46:06.679
It's amazing what men can
do when they put their heads
together.

46:06.680 --> 46:10.716
I can't rub out a flame
with two sticks, but this...

46:10.847 --> 46:11.946
You've come a long way.

46:15.613 --> 46:17.091
Not without its costs
though, I guess.

46:19.679 --> 46:20.446
Ernest holm...

46:22.946 --> 46:25.411
I guess they call
it a tragedy.

46:26.215 --> 46:29.048
Mm.

46:29.049 --> 46:31.547
I don't like those
kinds of machines.

46:31.548 --> 46:34.448
Drag a man to his death.

46:34.449 --> 46:37.079
It don't make sense.

46:37.080 --> 46:38.279
How do you think
his kids feel?

46:41.581 --> 46:45.498
Look, I know Ernest wronged
something by you all.

46:45.515 --> 46:48.348
You know it seems like these
challenges at the times make

46:48.349 --> 46:51.047
honest people confused
in their choosing.

46:51.048 --> 46:53.681
You know, I like to see
to myself sometimes.

46:53.682 --> 46:56.948
Like we agreed, it can make
you savage, put your hands

46:56.949 --> 47:00.348
on a man, just bloody
someone for an idea.

47:00.350 --> 47:02.015
Not saying it's not without
cause, you know, a man

47:02.016 --> 47:05.452
steals from me,
steals pure survival?

47:06.050 --> 47:08.781
You know, a beating
seems in the lines.

47:08.783 --> 47:09.782
Sound like rhymes.

47:11.383 --> 47:12.449
Just saying the
way I hear it.

47:12.450 --> 47:13.682
Talk talk.

47:13.683 --> 47:16.782
About what?

47:16.783 --> 47:18.849
About...

47:18.850 --> 47:23.015
What you did to Ernest
that night before he died.

47:26.350 --> 47:29.283
If you want, I can tell
those kids exactly what

47:29.284 --> 47:30.282
happened that night.

47:32.016 --> 47:33.016
What's that?

47:41.217 --> 47:43.250
Turned up in his effects.

47:43.251 --> 47:44.689
Family's thinking
"what in the hell?"

47:47.051 --> 47:49.283
And your boys talking up here
keep lathering the tale.

47:49.284 --> 47:51.563
You know, sounds like one
hell of a fight between you two.

47:52.951 --> 47:55.917
Who knows what to believe?

47:55.918 --> 47:58.183
If I'd set to do something
to Ernest holm, it wouldn't

47:58.184 --> 48:00.550
amount to concussion, and
that's the god damned "talk

48:00.551 --> 48:03.784
talk" as you put it.

48:03.785 --> 48:05.150
Now what do you want?

48:07.150 --> 48:09.016
Water.

48:11.285 --> 48:13.585
And what in the hell are
you going to do with that?

48:13.586 --> 48:15.384
The land is sick.

48:15.385 --> 48:16.552
No it's not.

48:16.553 --> 48:18.685
Your daddy's land
is dead sick.

48:18.686 --> 48:19.885
Killed it with pesticides.

48:19.886 --> 48:21.185
Everybody knows that.

48:21.186 --> 48:23.618
I'm not talking about his.

48:23.619 --> 48:26.385
Not Ernest's?

48:26.386 --> 48:30.251
Come on, you do it all the
time for the right price.

48:30.252 --> 48:34.352
Now you're going to do
it because it's right.

48:37.687 --> 48:40.685
The water line
to St. walstan.

48:40.686 --> 48:42.519
I'll see what I can do.

48:45.787 --> 48:48.953
Pray for rain.

48:48.954 --> 48:53.453
That shit'll put
me out of business.

49:01.020 --> 49:03.886
Blue skies, dry breeze.

49:03.887 --> 49:06.554
Out of the dusty earth.

49:06.555 --> 49:07.953
The things that we have
complained about for their

49:07.954 --> 49:10.033
brutal consistency can now
be seen as good graces and

49:11.588 --> 49:14.887
fair working conditions.

49:14.888 --> 49:17.954
In a few moments, this
tributary will distribute

49:17.955 --> 49:22.055
its life sustaining gifts
on this small piece of land.

49:22.056 --> 49:25.021
I raise these scissors in
thanks to the state water works.

49:25.022 --> 49:27.453
Who thankfully reversed
their decision to run an

49:27.454 --> 49:28.453
irriduct to St. walstan.

49:29.789 --> 49:31.866
It's been a long time since
we've seen such an act of

49:33.622 --> 49:37.421
peace and brotherhood
around here.

49:37.422 --> 49:38.822
For this, we are
sincerely grateful.

49:41.289 --> 49:42.288
Let us say a prayer.

49:43.823 --> 49:47.819
That this piece of land,
small as it may be, can be

49:48.590 --> 49:51.022
more than a symbol.

49:51.023 --> 49:53.555
That it can stand cultivated
as it once was by our dearly

49:53.556 --> 49:56.714
departed Ernest holm, whose
perseverance held that this

49:57.523 --> 50:02.523
land, fertile, could
flourish once again.

50:17.424 --> 50:18.863
And let his children
reap its reward.

51:54.727 --> 51:57.695
Already.

51:57.696 --> 51:59.527
Everything.

51:59.528 --> 52:00.861
It's so beautiful.

52:00.862 --> 52:04.328
It's almost a shame
to harvest it.

52:07.462 --> 52:09.428
What'd your father
say about all this?

52:12.260 --> 52:15.125
Probably wouldn't
say anything.

52:16.095 --> 52:17.095
Yeah.

52:19.095 --> 52:20.854
But he'd probably be
thinking you're alright.

52:23.163 --> 52:24.161
Really?

54:29.702 --> 54:30.733
Flem, you ride on back.

54:30.734 --> 54:32.267
I'll see you when
we're through.

54:32.268 --> 54:34.566
Why are you talking
about my land?

54:34.567 --> 54:35.968
It's not your land, boy.

54:35.969 --> 54:37.867
My wife, my land.

54:37.868 --> 54:38.901
Not her land neither.

54:38.902 --> 54:40.300
It belongs to the bank.

54:40.301 --> 54:41.900
Now you ride on back, I'll
come after and we'll talk

54:41.901 --> 54:42.701
about it.

54:42.702 --> 54:43.734
No, we'll talk now.

54:43.735 --> 54:46.467
Boy, this is adult
business now.

54:50.270 --> 54:51.801
God damn it Flemming!

54:53.202 --> 54:55.236
The explanation
is not important!

54:55.237 --> 54:56.734
What is important is that
the land is held by the

54:56.735 --> 54:57.968
bank.

54:57.969 --> 54:59.435
Ernest's farm's been in
foreclosure for years.

54:59.436 --> 55:01.801
He just never moved off and
nobody wanted to buy it.

55:01.802 --> 55:04.535
Now with the water, they
might, and you should be

55:04.536 --> 55:07.135
damn pleased if they do.

55:07.136 --> 55:08.535
How much does he owe?

55:08.536 --> 55:10.802
More money than you
can hope to raise.

55:10.803 --> 55:11.769
Now listen...

55:11.770 --> 55:13.770
What does he
owe, god damn it?

55:13.771 --> 55:15.568
Flemming, you be a man now.

55:15.569 --> 55:17.770
How much?

55:17.771 --> 55:19.902
Go talk to the bank.

55:19.903 --> 55:21.703
Sorry about that doctor.

55:21.704 --> 55:23.636
Just a local boy.

55:23.637 --> 55:26.168
Very passionate about the
history of these plots.

55:31.904 --> 55:33.736
Flem?

55:33.737 --> 55:35.402
Hey, let me help you.

55:35.403 --> 55:36.437
What?

55:36.438 --> 55:37.469
I said let me help.
- don't worry.

55:37.470 --> 55:38.536
I got it.

55:38.537 --> 55:39.736
Where are you
taking the machine?

55:39.737 --> 55:41.604
I need to go to
the mountains.

55:55.139 --> 55:56.369
Come on.

55:56.370 --> 55:59.337
I found somebody to
tell us what it's worth.

55:59.338 --> 56:01.616
Flem and Mary are going to
sell their baby when it's born.

56:02.439 --> 56:05.603
They need our help to find
out what they can get for it.

56:05.604 --> 56:07.171
Okay.

56:07.172 --> 56:08.810
Wrap the baby in a
blanket and hurry back.

56:22.772 --> 56:25.638
He keeps changing his
mind, but he said yes.

56:25.639 --> 56:27.605
It's too late for
second thoughts.

56:27.606 --> 56:29.972
I've already got
a buyer lined up.

56:29.973 --> 56:32.807
Send him out here.

56:36.040 --> 56:37.572
Why'd they give
you that money?

56:37.573 --> 56:39.739
I thought we were just here
to find out what it was worth.

56:39.740 --> 56:40.607
Oh, they just...

56:40.608 --> 56:42.607
Just want to
talk to you pal.

56:46.074 --> 56:47.372
What's up, what's up?

56:47.373 --> 56:48.774
Listen here.

56:48.775 --> 56:50.540
I don't want any
kind of trouble.

56:50.541 --> 56:52.073
I don't care if you're
getting cold feet.

56:52.074 --> 56:54.907
The deal is done and these
men are taking that baby.

56:54.908 --> 56:56.872
What are you talking about?

56:56.873 --> 56:57.439
No!

56:57.440 --> 56:58.906
Flem! Flem!

56:58.907 --> 56:59.540
Robbie, I'm sorry!

56:59.541 --> 57:00.608
Raagh!

57:07.407 --> 57:09.307
Shoot him too!

57:26.375 --> 57:27.274
Flem!

57:27.275 --> 57:28.275
Flem!

57:58.643 --> 57:59.942
Bank ain't never
kicking us off.

58:03.577 --> 58:04.777
Come on, this is
a hoorah, stud.

58:04.778 --> 58:06.442
Give me something.

58:06.443 --> 58:07.642
I just saved the farm.

58:07.643 --> 58:10.144
Who'd you sell the sim to?

58:13.443 --> 58:15.908
Robbie, of course.

58:15.909 --> 58:16.709
Aren't you happy?

58:16.710 --> 58:18.710
You hated that damn thing.

58:43.245 --> 58:47.245
<i>Come on
down, we love cheetahs.</i>

58:47.246 --> 58:49.877
<i>X marks the spot on the
four, so come on down and</i>

58:49.879 --> 58:52.277
<i>see coco, lazy and
me, Calvin hoyman.</i>

58:52.278 --> 58:54.477
<i>Where the vehicles vary, but
the deals are all the same.</i>

58:55.046 --> 58:57.778
This is Calvin hoyman,
calling from Calvin hoyman

58:59.880 --> 59:01.113
auto works.

59:01.114 --> 59:02.945
I'm trying to reach
Ernest holm, over.

59:02.946 --> 59:04.146
<i>This
is his son Jerome, over.</i>

59:07.613 --> 59:09.779
Well, I'm standing here in
sunny, beautiful overbluff

59:09.780 --> 59:11.245
with your simulit shadow.

59:11.246 --> 59:13.546
I don't know how you lost
it, but its default settings

59:13.547 --> 59:16.445
sent it back to me, over.

59:16.446 --> 59:20.379
We have the finest birds
from California to New York
city!

59:20.380 --> 59:23.546
Ladies and gentlemen, is
your money on the table?

59:23.547 --> 59:25.112
The betting is now closed.

59:25.113 --> 59:26.746
You don't play,
you can't win!

59:26.747 --> 59:28.147
Want to live a life
of ease and luxury?

59:28.147 --> 59:29.080
I'm your man!

59:29.081 --> 59:31.147
Three, two, one, let em go!

59:49.748 --> 59:51.781
Jesus, sooz.

59:51.782 --> 59:53.013
Why are you doing this?

59:55.481 --> 59:57.999
Robbie said to, until he got
back, so nobody'd ask any
questions.

01:00:01.784 --> 01:00:03.115
Come on.

01:00:03.116 --> 01:00:03.882
Flem?

01:00:03.883 --> 01:00:05.081
The fuck you doing here?

01:00:05.082 --> 01:00:06.480
A-a call came in on the cb.

01:00:06.481 --> 01:00:07.914
They said that...

01:00:07.915 --> 01:00:10.033
Yeah, I'm gonna run sooz home.
The baby's got a fever.

01:00:24.917 --> 01:00:26.883
What was all that about the
cb call down at the bird

01:00:26.884 --> 01:00:28.682
race today?

01:00:28.683 --> 01:00:29.682
Um...

01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:33.783
I, I was just thining
about the sim.

01:00:33.784 --> 01:00:36.048
I don't want Robbie to hit
her or break her up for

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:37.482
spare parts or something.

01:00:37.483 --> 01:00:38.716
What do you care?

01:00:38.717 --> 01:00:39.982
Robbie's long gone
with that menace.

01:00:39.983 --> 01:00:41.816
Don't you listen
when we talk?

01:00:41.817 --> 01:00:43.150
Who cares what
he does with it?

01:00:43.151 --> 01:00:46.216
That junker caused nothing
but grief in this house.

01:00:46.217 --> 01:00:48.349
I don't want to hear another
word, too, on the subject.

01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:49.383
Who's calling on the cb?

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:57.749
At the hospital.

01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:59.916
Mama wanted me to visit her,
so I came down to see if you

01:00:59.917 --> 01:01:02.649
could give me a ride.

01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:04.582
Well, the bus to
Quincy's running again.

01:01:04.583 --> 01:01:07.283
What's wrong with that?

01:01:07.284 --> 01:01:08.984
Nothing.

01:01:08.985 --> 01:01:11.085
Sort of like what goes on
in your head these days.

01:01:11.086 --> 01:01:12.450
That's a fine idea.

01:01:12.451 --> 01:01:13.651
Get you off your heels,
you're going to report back

01:01:13.652 --> 01:01:15.290
where all that money
we spend on her goes.

01:01:43.786 --> 01:01:45.864
<i>All unattended baggage
will be removed and destroyed.</i>

01:01:49.253 --> 01:01:52.386
<i>No unlicensed fruits,
vegetables or livestock</i>

01:01:52.387 --> 01:01:53.786
<i>allowed across the border.</i>

01:01:53.787 --> 01:01:55.985
Get your versapasses out!

01:01:55.986 --> 01:01:59.152
Come on! Come on!

01:01:59.154 --> 01:02:01.153
I can't read that when
it's in your pocket!

01:02:01.154 --> 01:02:04.118
Get your versapass out...

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.286
Versapasses only!

01:02:06.287 --> 01:02:07.286
Keep it moving forward!

01:02:10.488 --> 01:02:11.486
Get your versapasses out!

01:02:13.888 --> 01:02:15.721
Versapasses out!

01:02:15.722 --> 01:02:16.787
Are you a minor?

01:02:16.788 --> 01:02:17.420
What?

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:18.788
How old are you?

01:02:18.789 --> 01:02:20.754
14 and a half, sir.

01:02:20.755 --> 01:02:22.220
With your parents?

01:02:22.221 --> 01:02:23.887
Do you got a guardian?

01:02:23.888 --> 01:02:25.753
Better head back to
whichever way you came, you

01:02:25.754 --> 01:02:27.086
got it?

01:02:27.087 --> 01:02:29.586
You gotta be 18 to enter
the real world alone, boy.

01:02:29.587 --> 01:02:32.052
You can't be in this line.

01:02:32.054 --> 01:02:35.087
Now move it!

01:02:35.088 --> 01:02:36.087
Get your versapasses out!

01:02:38.523 --> 01:02:39.521
You heard me!

01:02:40.222 --> 01:02:41.554
Hey.

01:02:41.555 --> 01:02:43.233
I can get you across
for a throwaway price.

01:02:53.422 --> 01:02:55.654
You want the round trip, so
it's 100 each way plus 50

01:02:55.655 --> 01:02:57.054
for the cell phone.

01:02:57.055 --> 01:03:00.789
Once we start moving,
sit tight and be silent.

01:03:00.790 --> 01:03:03.488
You'll know when we're
across 'cause the road gets
smooth.

01:03:03.489 --> 01:03:05.328
If there's something
wrong, press send on this.

01:03:06.556 --> 01:03:07.555
And it really works?

01:03:08.756 --> 01:03:10.489
Picks up a signal
here sometimes.

01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:12.489
It'll definitely work
once we're across.

01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:13.823
Shh!

01:03:27.991 --> 01:03:29.157
Hello?

01:03:29.157 --> 01:03:30.257
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:03:30.258 --> 01:03:31.389
<i>I was just seeing
if it worked.</i>

01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:32.923
Okay, well hang up.

01:03:32.924 --> 01:03:35.157
<i>Wait, I wanted
to know something.</i>

01:03:35.158 --> 01:03:36.489
What?

01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:39.790
Just in case it's loud
or we get separated or...

01:03:39.791 --> 01:03:40.950
<i>What do you want
to know, kid?</i>

01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:43.792
Just your name.

01:03:44.857 --> 01:03:47.657
Anna.

01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:51.924
I'm Jerome.

01:03:51.925 --> 01:03:54.390
Just in case we need to
find each other or it's loud

01:03:54.391 --> 01:03:56.091
where we end up.

01:03:56.092 --> 01:03:59.223
<i>Okay, that's all. Bye.</i>

Hello?

01:04:38.794 --> 01:04:40.127
Are you listening to me?

01:04:41.627 --> 01:04:42.659
What?

01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:43.993
I said yes.

01:04:43.994 --> 01:04:45.292
Yes?

01:04:45.293 --> 01:04:46.726
Yes.

01:04:46.727 --> 01:04:48.225
Yes what?

01:04:48.226 --> 01:04:50.726
Yes, we're settlers.

01:04:50.727 --> 01:04:53.760
Oh.

01:04:53.761 --> 01:04:56.493
I don't have horns,

01:04:56.494 --> 01:04:57.627
but I do bite.

01:04:57.628 --> 01:04:58.627
Rrgh!

01:04:59.593 --> 01:05:00.994
Come on, kid.

01:05:07.929 --> 01:05:10.760
So you're stuck
in those camps?

01:05:10.761 --> 01:05:12.461
Do I look stuck?

01:05:12.462 --> 01:05:13.827
We fight to get
our land back.

01:05:13.828 --> 01:05:17.761
There's nothing
stuck about that.

01:05:17.761 --> 01:05:21.061
I don't have my gun on
me, but I've got one.

01:05:21.062 --> 01:05:22.494
I've got a dualie rifle.

01:05:22.495 --> 01:05:24.162
Slam.

01:05:24.163 --> 01:05:26.262
I have . 45.

01:05:26.263 --> 01:05:29.095
I share it with a
few people though.

01:05:29.096 --> 01:05:31.660
Hm. Mine's my father's.

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:33.629
You kill anyone?

01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:34.961
No.

01:05:34.962 --> 01:05:36.328
You?

01:05:36.329 --> 01:05:38.129
A goat.

01:05:38.130 --> 01:05:39.495
Sort of.

01:05:39.495 --> 01:05:42.161
But we ate it, so...

01:05:45.896 --> 01:05:46.895
I've seen people killed.

01:05:49.896 --> 01:05:50.895
Me too.

01:05:51.663 --> 01:05:53.729
Do you dream about them?

01:05:56.597 --> 01:05:59.096
No.

01:05:59.097 --> 01:06:00.896
Good.

01:06:00.897 --> 01:06:01.897
I'm fucking haunted.

01:06:05.994 --> 01:06:08.626
"Where the vehicles vary,
but the deals are all the same!"

01:06:09.329 --> 01:06:11.963
Well...

01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:20.997
Keep that hundred.

01:06:20.998 --> 01:06:23.296
The whole round
trip thing's a scam.

01:06:23.297 --> 01:06:24.298
What do you mean?

01:06:24.299 --> 01:06:25.664
To cross back over.

01:06:25.665 --> 01:06:26.665
It's a scam.

01:06:26.666 --> 01:06:27.830
You don't need to call us.

01:06:27.831 --> 01:06:30.097
Just walk right through.

01:06:30.099 --> 01:06:31.731
The border guards
won't stop you.

01:06:31.732 --> 01:06:34.797
They don't care
you're going back.

01:06:34.798 --> 01:06:36.098
Okay.

01:06:36.099 --> 01:06:37.596
Thank you.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.497
Okay.

01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:46.397
Hey, real quick.

01:06:47.431 --> 01:06:49.632
What?

01:06:49.634 --> 01:06:51.911
You ever meet a
man named Ernest?

01:06:52.966 --> 01:06:54.398
Ernest?

01:06:54.399 --> 01:06:55.498
You know, like a guy.

01:06:55.499 --> 01:06:57.132
Not like an old man.

01:06:57.133 --> 01:06:58.267
Ernest...

01:06:58.268 --> 01:07:00.399
Ernest holm.

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.131
Mm.... I don't know.

01:07:03.132 --> 01:07:05.465
I meet a lot of people.

01:07:05.466 --> 01:07:08.331
I don't.

01:07:11.966 --> 01:07:14.498
Ernest holm...

01:07:14.499 --> 01:07:16.466
It's important.

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:19.666
Mm...

01:07:20.734 --> 01:07:22.766
I'm sorry.

01:07:22.767 --> 01:07:23.933
Mm.

01:07:23.934 --> 01:07:25.667
I gotta go.

01:07:29.002 --> 01:07:30.832
Bye bye, Jerome.

01:07:30.833 --> 01:07:32.233
Bye bye.

01:07:46.735 --> 01:07:50.801
Sorry to wake you.

01:07:54.768 --> 01:07:56.434
You know, I sold your
machine ten years ago for a

01:07:56.435 --> 01:07:58.300
reforestation project.

01:07:58.301 --> 01:07:59.568
Six owners since then.

01:07:59.569 --> 01:08:01.801
I love thinking about
all they've seen.

01:08:01.802 --> 01:08:03.667
Them wheat farms of yours
are never supposed to be as

01:08:03.668 --> 01:08:05.567
far west as they are.

01:08:05.568 --> 01:08:08.234
You ever heard of
manifest destiny?

01:08:08.235 --> 01:08:09.169
No sir.

01:08:09.170 --> 01:08:10.568
I like history.

01:08:10.569 --> 01:08:12.268
Everyone's so damned scared
to repeat it, they never

01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:14.635
thought how bad the
alternatives was.

01:08:14.636 --> 01:08:16.468
Now look around
at this world.

01:08:16.469 --> 01:08:18.935
Seems to me, repeat business
to the well of bad ideas

01:08:18.935 --> 01:08:22.636
would've put us all a lot
better off than we are today.

01:08:22.636 --> 01:08:25.136
You know what
conservatism is?

01:08:25.136 --> 01:08:26.635
No sir.

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:28.635
Well, that's gone too.

01:08:28.636 --> 01:08:29.568
Prepare yourself.

01:08:29.569 --> 01:08:31.702
She's a sight.

01:08:31.703 --> 01:08:32.801
Okay, beauty.

01:08:34.002 --> 01:08:36.636
Let's see what
they did to you.

01:08:36.638 --> 01:08:37.795
Alright, let's get
this going.

01:08:39.571 --> 01:08:41.935
<i>Calvin, pick up extension 454.</i>

01:08:41.937 --> 01:08:44.636
<i>Calvin, please pick
up extension 454.</i>

01:08:44.638 --> 01:08:46.602
What's that?

01:08:46.603 --> 01:08:48.403
Look familiar?

01:08:48.404 --> 01:08:49.136
That's me.

01:08:49.136 --> 01:08:50.804
Uh huh.

01:08:51.970 --> 01:08:54.136
Ever seen this?

01:08:56.004 --> 01:08:57.336
That's its face.

01:08:57.337 --> 01:08:58.270
That's right.

01:08:58.270 --> 01:08:59.804
It's its eyes.

01:08:59.805 --> 01:09:03.502
Avoids objects and obstacles
using a laser guidance system.

01:09:03.505 --> 01:09:05.861
Lasers measure distance,
terrain, grade of slopes and
things.

01:09:08.138 --> 01:09:11.071
The laser reflection
information is captured, and

01:09:11.072 --> 01:09:13.770
on this monitor, we can see
images of the landscape and

01:09:13.772 --> 01:09:16.138
its surroundings.

01:09:16.139 --> 01:09:18.904
If you know what you're
looking at, it comes clear.

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:20.983
This dial can just shuttle
around, find where it gave

01:09:23.505 --> 01:09:25.670
trouble or broke down.

01:09:25.671 --> 01:09:27.639
Maybe see why.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.837
<i>Calvin, please come to the
showroom.</i>

01:09:31.572 --> 01:09:33.437
<i>Calvin, please come
to the showroom.</i>

01:09:33.438 --> 01:09:35.337
We're getting on the
body work tout suite.

01:09:35.339 --> 01:09:37.238
It shall be tip top.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.971
Excuse me a moment.

01:10:03.307 --> 01:10:06.306
This is a machine, the
simulit

01:10:06.307 --> 01:10:07.339
shadow.

01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:10.506
Look at that, in
very good work...

01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:15.574
The machine hurt?

01:10:15.575 --> 01:10:19.173
No, I'm just thinking it
knows how

01:10:19.174 --> 01:10:21.240
hard the work's
gonna be around here.

01:11:26.311 --> 01:11:27.442
Those watermen
paid me to take it.

01:11:27.443 --> 01:11:29.509
There's insurance
money in it.

01:13:35.682 --> 01:13:36.682
What's that?

01:13:37.682 --> 01:13:39.314
It's raining.

01:14:01.017 --> 01:14:03.582
Jesus, stud.

01:14:03.583 --> 01:14:05.248
It's an act of god.

01:14:05.249 --> 01:14:07.649
Thought that fucker
had abandoned us.

01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:10.217
Guess he left just to hitch
a jackpot and drag it back.

01:14:11.184 --> 01:14:13.617
How's your mother?

01:14:15.351 --> 01:14:17.308
She really appreciates
everything you're doing for

01:14:17.851 --> 01:14:19.684
her with the money.

01:14:19.685 --> 01:14:23.117
It's a pleasure.

01:14:23.118 --> 01:14:26.517
I'm gonna go see her again
this week, if that's okay.

01:14:26.518 --> 01:14:28.082
Told her I'd spend
the night again.

01:14:28.083 --> 01:14:31.449
Ah, her sweet boy.

01:14:31.450 --> 01:14:34.750
How'd you get
the simulit back?

01:14:34.751 --> 01:14:36.851
What do you mean?

01:14:36.851 --> 01:14:38.685
You know, our machine.

01:14:38.686 --> 01:14:40.083
The shadow.

01:14:40.084 --> 01:14:41.984
When you sold it to Robbie,
how'd you get it back?

01:14:41.985 --> 01:14:43.452
I didn't.

01:14:45.319 --> 01:14:48.152
It's out there in the barn.

01:14:48.153 --> 01:14:50.919
Saw it as I walked
in from the road.

01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:56.851
It's all cleaned up,
but it's ours alright.

01:15:02.585 --> 01:15:06.119
Yeah, Robbie must've
brought it back.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.819
If he think he's getting a
refund, if he's really as

01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:10.386
dumb as he is...

01:15:10.387 --> 01:15:11.545
Glad to have her
back, though.

01:15:14.921 --> 01:15:18.020
Can't blame her for
everything, right?

01:15:18.021 --> 01:15:19.920
Yeah, sure stud.

01:15:19.922 --> 01:15:21.853
I'll go talk to Robbie.

01:15:32.854 --> 01:15:35.520
Do you believe it?

01:15:35.521 --> 01:15:38.587
Just wish your
father could see it.

01:15:43.589 --> 01:15:45.586
Mary won't tell me if she's
having a boy or a girl.

01:15:48.022 --> 01:15:51.353
There's no way to know.

01:15:51.354 --> 01:15:54.453
I don't want to
be called grandma.

01:15:54.454 --> 01:15:55.772
I'm putting you
in charge of that.

01:15:58.489 --> 01:16:02.255
Okay.

01:16:02.256 --> 01:16:04.294
You'll have to come up with
a whole new name for me.

01:16:06.622 --> 01:16:09.155
You like the idea of that?

01:16:09.156 --> 01:16:11.421
Think about it.

01:16:15.923 --> 01:16:18.222
Something's wrong.

01:16:19.355 --> 01:16:21.688
Don't worry about me.

01:16:25.290 --> 01:16:26.609
I'll worry about
you, like Ernest.

01:16:29.257 --> 01:16:31.155
Like dad.

01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:38.290
This boy, Flemming.

01:16:38.291 --> 01:16:41.355
Does he make her happy?

01:16:43.559 --> 01:16:44.556
Yes.

01:16:47.024 --> 01:16:48.023
He holds her up?

01:16:49.490 --> 01:16:50.523
He's a good man?

01:16:50.524 --> 01:16:52.224
A good boy?

01:16:52.225 --> 01:16:53.789
Yes.

01:17:21.791 --> 01:17:23.157
I'm sorry.

01:17:26.193 --> 01:17:27.791
God damn vultures
heading west again.

01:17:30.126 --> 01:17:32.491
They'll eat all
our new seed.

01:17:32.492 --> 01:17:33.992
This thing don't
fire straight.

01:17:33.993 --> 01:17:35.491
Piece of shit.

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.792
Who knew about you.

01:18:10.793 --> 01:18:12.692
You're messing with
my sights, cheater?

01:18:12.693 --> 01:18:13.992
Lucky shot.

01:18:13.993 --> 01:18:15.159
It is off.

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.026
I'll take it in
town to get fixed.

01:18:17.027 --> 01:18:18.027
<i>Okay, funnyman.</i>

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:19.693
<i>Make your jokes.</i>

01:18:19.694 --> 01:18:21.693
<i>But I'm going to lay
down the law right now!</i>

01:18:29.695 --> 01:18:31.294
<i>I keep the
rent money in the old coffee</i>

01:18:31.295 --> 01:18:32.761
<i>pot and, I keep the...</i>

01:18:32.762 --> 01:18:35.295
<i>Well why'd the landlord
come to me for the money?</i>

01:18:35.296 --> 01:18:37.528
<i>Oh, well that was
a misunderstanding.</i>

01:18:37.529 --> 01:18:40.028
<i>I was busy when he came, so
I said "go to the old pot</i>

01:18:40.029 --> 01:18:41.027
<i>and get the money"</i>

01:18:47.529 --> 01:18:49.828
<i>I'm going down town
to pay these bills.</i>

01:18:55.096 --> 01:18:56.094
I spoke to Robbie today.

01:18:56.764 --> 01:18:58.762
What's that?

01:19:00.963 --> 01:19:03.428
On the radio.

01:19:03.429 --> 01:19:05.496
He was looking for
you, Robbie was.

01:19:05.497 --> 01:19:07.595
What did he say?

01:19:07.596 --> 01:19:09.495
Just that he's
looking for you.

01:19:09.496 --> 01:19:10.862
Where is he?

01:19:12.695 --> 01:19:15.663
He didn't say.

01:19:15.664 --> 01:19:16.662
Well what did he say?

01:19:18.064 --> 01:19:19.596
Just said he was
looking for you.

01:19:20.531 --> 01:19:23.462
That was it.

01:19:24.397 --> 01:19:26.796
What, on the...

01:19:28.031 --> 01:19:29.830
On the ten meter?

01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:33.030
Yeah.

01:19:34.464 --> 01:19:36.696
Did he give a channel
to radio back on?

01:19:36.697 --> 01:19:39.831
He said he was on
someone else's handle.

01:19:39.832 --> 01:19:42.830
What, someone else's handle
or someone else's radio?

01:19:42.831 --> 01:19:43.996
Handle, I think.

01:19:43.997 --> 01:19:45.931
Handle.

01:19:45.932 --> 01:19:47.064
Huh.

01:19:47.065 --> 01:19:48.064
Yeah.

01:19:55.098 --> 01:19:56.097
That's a lie.

01:19:56.832 --> 01:20:00.497
I don't know, that's
just what he said.

01:20:00.965 --> 01:20:02.664
No, not him.

01:20:02.665 --> 01:20:05.096
You. That's a lie, that last
part.

01:20:05.097 --> 01:20:06.598
Flem...

01:20:06.599 --> 01:20:07.931
Robbie doesn't have a radio,
so he doesn't have a handle,

01:20:07.932 --> 01:20:09.431
so he didn't call here.

01:20:09.432 --> 01:20:10.431
Tell her.

01:20:14.833 --> 01:20:16.532
I saw what you thought.

01:20:16.533 --> 01:20:18.365
I saw what you just thought.

01:20:18.366 --> 01:20:19.299
Flem, stop it.

01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:20.332
Robbie called,
looking for me.

01:20:20.333 --> 01:20:21.531
That's what you said?

01:20:21.532 --> 01:20:22.264
Yes.

01:20:22.265 --> 01:20:22.933
And you spoke to him?

01:20:22.934 --> 01:20:24.165
Yep.

01:20:24.166 --> 01:20:25.933
Okay.

01:20:38.099 --> 01:20:39.966
And the rest of this land
wouldn't cost you anything

01:20:39.967 --> 01:20:41.299
up front.

01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:43.301
What, it's all of it?

01:20:43.301 --> 01:20:45.599
Probably the line runs from
the basalt compression to

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:46.965
the foothills.

01:20:46.967 --> 01:20:49.633
From the foothills, it runs
almost diagonal right to

01:20:49.634 --> 01:20:51.833
where you stand.

01:20:51.834 --> 01:20:52.834
That's all of it, Flemming.

01:20:52.835 --> 01:20:54.035
20,000 acres.

01:20:54.036 --> 01:20:55.834
That's all my land.

01:20:55.835 --> 01:20:56.835
Proud of you boy.

01:20:57.701 --> 01:21:00.200
Bringing the papers.

01:21:07.168 --> 01:21:08.834
One for you, Flemming.

01:21:26.435 --> 01:21:27.933
<i>Nflem, you're never there when I</i>

01:21:27.934 --> 01:21:29.000
<i>radio you.</i>

01:21:29.001 --> 01:21:30.835
<i>We should talk
about some things.</i>

01:21:30.836 --> 01:21:32.101
<i>I'm okay.</i>

01:21:32.102 --> 01:21:33.302
<i>Is sooz mad?</i>

01:21:33.302 --> 01:21:35.168
<i>I don't want to
come back if she is.</i>

01:21:35.169 --> 01:21:36.534
<i>Can you meet me tomorrow?</i>

01:21:36.535 --> 01:21:38.368
<i>The fork at
independence pass.</i>

01:21:38.369 --> 01:21:40.436
<i>Please bring some
food and spike.</i>

01:21:40.437 --> 01:21:41.535
<i>I'm in trouble.</i>

01:21:41.537 --> 01:21:42.535
<i>Robbie.</i>

01:21:42.770 --> 01:21:45.436
You said 20,000 acres.

01:21:46.437 --> 01:21:48.169
Is that taxable or usable?

01:21:48.170 --> 01:21:49.635
But it's pitch black out.

01:21:51.537 --> 01:21:53.968
There's barely a moon.

01:21:53.969 --> 01:21:56.101
I've got to stake the new
property lines and see about

01:21:56.102 --> 01:21:57.702
the second air double.

01:21:57.703 --> 01:22:01.135
If they can't run it,
the land's worthless.

01:22:01.136 --> 01:22:04.137
Why not go in the morning?

01:22:04.138 --> 01:22:06.736
'Cause I want to be back
before tomorrow night.

01:22:10.271 --> 01:22:13.537
What are you really doing?

01:22:13.538 --> 01:22:15.170
Stop, Mary.

01:22:17.406 --> 01:22:18.804
Can't you take
the dirt bike?

01:22:20.604 --> 01:22:22.436
I was maddening a belt,

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:23.936
but I can't make that.

01:22:23.937 --> 01:22:25.537
You're not yourself.

01:22:27.371 --> 01:22:28.504
What else is going on?

01:22:28.505 --> 01:22:29.938
I'm just asking.

01:22:34.337 --> 01:22:36.004
Don't.

01:22:47.539 --> 01:22:51.103
Where's the dualie?

01:22:51.104 --> 01:22:54.271
I took it to get
repaired, remember?

01:22:54.272 --> 01:22:56.171
No, I don't.

01:22:56.172 --> 01:22:58.772
You said it didn't
shoot straight.

01:22:58.773 --> 01:23:00.871
Oh, that's right.

01:23:00.872 --> 01:23:01.804
Damn.

01:23:01.805 --> 01:23:02.939
I'm heading out
for the night.

01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:04.306
Don't want any trouble
near the border.

01:23:04.307 --> 01:23:05.339
Oh.

01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:07.406
I can go with you.

01:23:15.041 --> 01:23:18.272
You know the cb talk?

01:23:18.273 --> 01:23:20.872
Robbie?

01:23:20.873 --> 01:23:24.940
All of everything I'm sorry.

01:23:28.207 --> 01:23:30.106
It's okay.

01:23:53.708 --> 01:23:55.675
Robbie!

01:24:18.176 --> 01:24:19.107
Robbie!

01:24:19.108 --> 01:24:20.341
Robbie!

01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:23.210
Robbie!

01:24:24.743 --> 01:24:26.642
Sooz is really mad at you!

01:24:28.777 --> 01:24:30.943
It's serious, Robbie!

01:24:35.878 --> 01:24:37.243
Robbie!

01:25:09.812 --> 01:25:12.644
Help!

01:25:12.645 --> 01:25:15.144
Help me!

01:25:15.145 --> 01:25:17.211
Robbie!

01:25:17.212 --> 01:25:19.277
Help me!

01:25:23.112 --> 01:25:24.178
Help!

01:25:24.179 --> 01:25:26.444
Help me!

01:25:26.445 --> 01:25:27.545
Robbie, I'm sorry!

01:25:36.613 --> 01:25:41.579
Robbie, I'm so sorry.

01:25:48.681 --> 01:25:49.679
Oh, stud.

01:25:52.047 --> 01:25:53.326
C-can you help me please?
Please?

01:25:56.314 --> 01:25:57.346
Can you?

01:25:57.347 --> 01:26:02.545
Can you help, can you help me
out?

01:26:10.514 --> 01:26:12.080
Is Robbie with you?

01:26:33.382 --> 01:26:34.214
It was a...

01:26:34.215 --> 01:26:36.547
It was an accident!

01:26:36.548 --> 01:26:38.514
Just a god damned accident!

01:26:41.716 --> 01:26:43.514
You don't, you don't
want to do this!

01:26:46.683 --> 01:26:47.948
No.

01:26:47.949 --> 01:26:50.081
I don't.

01:27:38.184 --> 01:27:39.183
Help!

01:27:40.518 --> 01:27:41.884
Help!

01:27:43.451 --> 01:27:44.851
Help me!

01:27:46.185 --> 01:27:48.617
Help!

01:27:49.719 --> 01:27:50.718
Help!

01:27:59.118 --> 01:28:00.584
Help!

01:28:00.585 --> 01:28:01.951
<i>Help!</i>

01:28:26.852 --> 01:28:29.019
What are you going
to tell your sister?

01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:36.286
I'm not going to
tell her anything.

01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:42.220
Not about you.

01:28:42.222 --> 01:28:45.387
Not about before.

01:28:45.388 --> 01:28:47.387
Not, not about...

01:28:55.654 --> 01:28:59.386
You'll kill her if
you do this stud.

01:28:59.387 --> 01:29:01.266
You know what her life
would be like without me.

01:29:04.021 --> 01:29:07.521
She'll hate that baby.

01:29:07.522 --> 01:29:08.961
She'll hate that
baby if you do this.

01:29:11.789 --> 01:29:13.468
She'll hate you and
she won't even know it.

01:29:14.422 --> 01:29:16.221
It's...

01:29:17.188 --> 01:29:19.620
Such a big world.

01:29:19.622 --> 01:29:22.554
You're thinking so small!

01:29:22.555 --> 01:29:24.314
What happened to your
father was an accident!

01:29:27.289 --> 01:29:29.355
And Robbie, he
was just too dumb.

01:29:29.356 --> 01:29:32.287
I feel real bad about that.

01:29:32.288 --> 01:29:34.447
I wish I could take it all
back, but it's, it's selfish

01:29:37.023 --> 01:29:39.188
to blame, stud.

01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:40.289
I mean, Jerome.

01:29:43.490 --> 01:29:45.056
Good.

01:29:45.057 --> 01:29:47.955
Jerome.

01:29:47.956 --> 01:29:48.956
Just no more blame.

01:29:52.224 --> 01:29:54.554
You be the first.

01:29:57.890 --> 01:30:00.222
No more blame.

01:30:04.357 --> 01:30:07.122
You can't, stud.

01:30:07.123 --> 01:30:09.957

No thanks.

01:32:08.862 --> 01:32:10.695
What should I do?

01:32:10.696 --> 01:32:12.694
Two days.

01:32:12.695 --> 01:32:14.694
Where the hell is he?

01:32:18.129 --> 01:32:21.163
I think wait.

01:32:21.164 --> 01:32:22.862
Just wait a while.

01:32:22.863 --> 01:32:23.863
God damn it.

01:32:25.465 --> 01:32:28.530
There's too much
pressure on him.

01:32:28.531 --> 01:32:30.563
Is he buying
something, selling...

01:32:30.564 --> 01:32:32.561
Just... just doesn't make sense
him gone this long.

01:32:34.696 --> 01:32:36.929
What do you
think's going on?

01:32:39.264 --> 01:32:40.329
Just wait for now.

01:32:52.532 --> 01:32:55.230
You should go
close your eyes.

01:32:55.231 --> 01:32:58.030
That's a long trip
to the hospital?

01:32:58.031 --> 01:33:00.530
How is momma?

01:33:00.531 --> 01:33:03.829
It's sweet of you to go
visit her so much lately.

01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:06.697
I'd like to see her too.

01:33:06.698 --> 01:33:09.130
We could even move
her back in, right?

01:33:09.131 --> 01:33:14.531
We'd have the money to build
her brace wires here now, no?

01:33:17.798 --> 01:33:19.265
He wouldn't like that.

01:33:20.298 --> 01:33:25.230
So I don't want to be
held to what I just said.

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.198
Okay.

01:33:33.866 --> 01:33:36.297
Boy or girl?

01:33:36.298 --> 01:33:38.298
Girl.

01:33:38.299 --> 01:33:39.299
Funny, why?

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:45.332
I know that's what you want.
