WEBVTT

00:07.600 --> 00:10.640
I want you to listen to me, and I want you
to understand what I'm saying.

00:10.880 --> 00:11.880
We're through.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.600
- Can I see that?
- Is there something wrong?

00:13.720 --> 00:15.640
Milton. It's an unusual name.

00:15.920 --> 00:18.520
Cam, find out if Daniel Milton
has a daughter named Eve.

00:18.960 --> 00:21.400
I think I've done it.
I'm gonna get my badge back.

00:21.600 --> 00:24.920
- What's happening?
- They're all in anaphylactic shock.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.080
We should
get them home now.

00:29.680 --> 00:30.680
Police!

00:30.840 --> 00:33.680
- Neil?
- Hi, Evette. Or should I say "Anna"?

00:35.320 --> 00:36.520
Guys!

00:38.080 --> 00:41.000
You're not getting out of there.
It's bombproof.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.640
Oh, no.

00:56.520 --> 00:57.760
Hello?

00:59.880 --> 01:01.080
Hello?

01:04.320 --> 01:05.760
Dad?

02:18.520 --> 02:22.600
TEMPLE

03:38.640 --> 03:41.320
- Stick the radio on, would you?
- No.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.480
- What do you mean, no?
- No, I'm hungry and I'm tired.

03:45.360 --> 03:48.840
- I'm falling asleep at the wheel here.
- Then don't.

03:57.560 --> 03:59.200
You gonna answer that?

04:00.920 --> 04:02.680
That's not my phone.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.480
Oh, shit!

04:26.880 --> 04:28.800
Okay. Now what do we do?

04:30.600 --> 04:35.000
Well, we could switch it off, but that
won't stop them trying to get hold of him.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.960
We're gonna have to text them back.

04:54.560 --> 04:55.800
There you go.

04:56.360 --> 04:59.080
- Why do I have to do it?
- Because you knew him.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.120
"Head's a mess"?

05:31.920 --> 05:33.640
That's what you gonna send?

05:33.880 --> 05:35.880
You do it then, if it's so easy.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.280
Okay...

05:44.920 --> 05:47.640
-That's better. That's good.
-All right. Send.

05:48.120 --> 05:49.720
- Okay.
- Okay, ours, too.

05:49.840 --> 05:52.800
Because if they can track that,
they can track ours.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.400
- Coming?
- Yeah.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.320
- Where even are we?
- Nowhere close.

06:10.640 --> 06:13.720
Are you completely sure
this is even really necessary?

06:15.160 --> 06:17.960
I'm serious. We already flushed two
bodies away from the bunker.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.080
Why not three?

06:19.200 --> 06:21.400
Yeah, because that worked
really well last time, didn't it?

06:21.520 --> 06:23.720
All I'm saying is that maybe
we can avoid all of this.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.720
Look, can we just not discuss it?

06:26.200 --> 06:27.560
- All right?
- What?

06:28.280 --> 06:30.200
We have to talk about this.

06:30.680 --> 06:32.680
You cannot expect me
to just go with whatever...

06:32.800 --> 06:36.040
Beth, all right? We're going
to where I was going to take Beth

06:36.280 --> 06:37.760
if and when she...

06:38.440 --> 06:40.520
If she died, all right?

06:45.800 --> 06:47.080
Okay.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.520
Okay, thank you.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.360
Talk me through this plan.

07:06.960 --> 07:11.000
There's a quiet cove near the cottage.
I've been going there for years.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.720
We can row him out near there.
We can drop him over the side.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.480
All we need is
something to weigh him down.

07:30.920 --> 07:33.120
This is...
This is very fancy.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.360
Yeah, I suppose it is.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.720
You're not gonna propose
or anything, are you?

07:38.840 --> 07:41.520
No, no. I booked it
last minute, to be honest.

07:42.120 --> 07:45.520
There wasn't much available by the time
you knew you could get away from...

07:45.640 --> 07:48.880
Jack. It's okay, you can say his name,
it's not a disease.

07:55.360 --> 07:58.640
Did you tell her it was our honeymoon,
or something?

08:00.120 --> 08:03.040
Believe it or not, this was
the cheapest one they had available.

08:03.160 --> 08:06.400
Well, you sure know how to make
a lady feel special.

08:07.400 --> 08:10.560
- I got something for you.
- What? Really? No, no.

08:10.720 --> 08:13.960
- You didn't have to get me anything.
- Relax. It's not a gold watch.

08:14.080 --> 08:17.360
And if it was, it would also be
the cheapest one available.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.120
What is it?

08:22.960 --> 08:24.400
Psychopath test?

08:24.520 --> 08:27.400
Yeah, since you're so confident
you represent the 1% of surgeons

08:27.520 --> 08:29.720
who aren't devoid
of basic human emotions,

08:29.840 --> 08:31.840
I thought
we might as well check.

08:32.680 --> 08:35.840
I took the liberty of circling the few
that I thought were pretty obvious.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.920
Like "excess glibness
or supeficial charm."

08:39.960 --> 08:43.960
Or "grandiose overestimation
of self-worth." Nice.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.360
"A lack of remorse or guilt."

08:49.280 --> 08:50.560
There he is.

08:52.080 --> 08:55.040
Well, I guess if I was
capable of feeling anything,

08:55.920 --> 08:57.920
I'd have to tell you that I love it.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.720
Well, then, you're welcome.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.560
It's nice, isn't it,
not to be in a rush for a change?

09:11.080 --> 09:12.560
Yeah.

09:37.480 --> 09:40.120
Excuse me.
I said, excuse me.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.520
- You speaking to me?
- Yeah, I bloody am.

09:45.640 --> 09:49.000
You notice anything in particular about
where you just dumped your car?

09:49.840 --> 09:53.520
Those spaces are for people going
through this shit. Not you.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.600
Listen, mate, we're only gonna be
about five minutes.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.960
Yeah, don't "mate" me.
This isn't a dialogue, you lazy prick.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.280
Just move your car.

09:59.960 --> 10:03.160
Look, like I said,
we'll be in and out. Okay?

10:06.480 --> 10:09.400
You're not going to get what you want.
Go and have a sit down, all right?

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
You know what? It's entitled bastards
like you that make me sick.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.280
What are you doing?
You've got a child strapped to your chest.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.280
Plus, he's bigger than you
and he's had no sleep.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.640
What, he's had no sleep?
What? He's had no sleep?

10:21.960 --> 10:25.040
I've had no sleep, love.
He's teething.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.640
The only reason we're at the action
in the first place

10:27.760 --> 10:31.960
is to give my wife half an hour's peace,
so she can sit on the toilet and cry!

10:48.200 --> 10:51.760
- This will keep him down.
- You could have moved the car.

10:55.200 --> 10:58.120
- Can you stop...
- Look, I'm fine, okay?

10:58.280 --> 11:00.520
You've got all this blood
all over you.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.960
Ah, shit!

11:04.920 --> 11:06.400
So have you.

11:09.520 --> 11:12.920
Jesus. Okay.
How much money have we got?

11:13.720 --> 11:15.120
- Money?
- Yeah.

11:19.600 --> 11:20.760
That's it.

11:21.160 --> 11:24.600
- Why? I've got a card?
- No, they can track card payments.

11:25.880 --> 11:27.520
We need a new wardrobe.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.480
Okay.

11:31.480 --> 11:35.440
- It's gonna need to be inconspicuous.
- No. Needs to be cheap.

12:02.520 --> 12:05.160
Thought you'd be better at this,
Mr. Surgeon.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.680
Well, maybe I am,
and I'm just letting you win.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.680
Right. How silly of me.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.160
- Okay, here we go.
- Some place, huh?

12:19.600 --> 12:21.440
Yeah, it's great.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.720
You two on the Groupon
as well, are you?

12:26.320 --> 12:28.960
Groupon? No, no, I wish.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.640
I guess we're the suckers
who paid full price.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.720
You here
for an anniversary, or...

12:37.200 --> 12:41.520
We got married this time last spring, so
we thought we'd better do something.

12:42.280 --> 12:43.920
Well, congratulations.

12:44.400 --> 12:47.920
No, we're actually not married.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.400
No, we... we work together.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.880
But we needed to get away, you know?
Get some privacy.

12:56.600 --> 13:01.560
'Cause, you know, sexual relationships
are a big no-no within the military.

13:02.480 --> 13:06.320
But I saw him bayonetting
a sandbag one morning,

13:06.520 --> 13:08.760
and I just found
I couldn't look away.

13:09.880 --> 13:14.280
How about you, then? Fell in love with
her first time you saw her in camouflage?

13:14.920 --> 13:17.240
Well, no, actually. I...

13:19.160 --> 13:22.160
I think I was sunk
the first time she ever spoke to me.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.440
That was it, really.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.520
It must have been that guy.
Do we have a spare tire?

13:42.880 --> 13:45.160
How should I know? I only bought
the thing about six hours ago.

13:45.280 --> 13:48.280
- I wasn't in the mood to check.
- I would've checked.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.520
Yeah, but you were busy,
weren't you?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.680
Discharging those people
you nearly killed.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.240
There's one way to find out.

14:08.680 --> 14:11.040
- There it is.
- Thank Christ.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.320
We're gonna have to get him out.

14:37.640 --> 14:39.840
Yeah, this will do.

14:56.280 --> 14:57.960
Fuck it.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.560
This shouldn't take too long.

15:03.520 --> 15:05.560
Tell me that's not his gun.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.560
Is that the gun that fired the bullet
that went in his head?

15:09.680 --> 15:13.440
- I told you to leave it behind.
- Yeah, all right. It was a mistake.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.560
You could have moved the car.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.560
Christ.

15:20.040 --> 15:22.520
I know the guy was a dick,
but he had a point.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.600
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

15:27.680 --> 15:28.840
I'm sorry.

15:28.960 --> 15:32.320
It's just such bad news, Anna,
that it's here.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.320
Such bad news
on top of all the other bad news

15:36.480 --> 15:38.960
that's dribbled through the door
over the last 24 hours.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.800
But you know what? It's okay.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.160
It's going to be okay.

15:47.960 --> 15:51.240
I don't think that's right.
That doesn't go on like that.

15:51.360 --> 15:54.520
Yeah, well, I've have not used
this exact type of jack before, all right?

15:54.640 --> 15:56.440
What difference does it make?

15:56.920 --> 15:59.000
How can you not know
how to change a tire?

15:59.120 --> 16:02.160
Because I'm a surgeon.
I pay mechanics to do this stuff.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.520
How hard can it be?
I'll happily have a go.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.760
Pour water on a drowning man,
why don't you?

16:08.880 --> 16:12.400
Oh, my God! Can you try for a second
not to be such an obstinate asshole?

16:12.520 --> 16:16.480
"Obstinate"? How is it you know how to
say "obstinate" in a second language,

16:16.600 --> 16:19.480
but you haven't got the common sense
to leave a at the scene of the crime?

16:19.600 --> 16:22.320
I told you to leave it behind.
There was a reason for it.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.640
You did...

16:45.520 --> 16:47.560
- Hello, there.
- Hi.

16:48.280 --> 16:52.640
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Bit of car trouble, I'm afraid.

16:53.480 --> 16:57.240
- You need a tow?
- No, no, no. It's just a flat tire.

17:03.200 --> 17:07.000
Honey, would you mind grabbing that tool
that's still in the boot?

17:07.480 --> 17:09.040
Yeah.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.800
We're only really
getting started.

17:17.720 --> 17:20.400
- Your jack.
- What about it?

17:21.480 --> 17:23.480
You got it
on the wrong way around.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.520
Do we?

17:26.120 --> 17:29.200
Yeah, well, we...
We don't really know what we're doing,

17:29.320 --> 17:31.480
but I suppose we'll get
the hang of it eventually.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.000
Thank you.

17:37.360 --> 17:41.280
Hey, budge over.
This will only take me a minute.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.200
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.800
Sure. Thank you.

17:47.640 --> 17:49.560
Just drop that down there.

17:50.480 --> 17:53.720
Right in proverbial this
babes in the woods.

17:54.200 --> 17:58.480
You're lucky I was heading by.
This place is quiet this time of year.

17:58.760 --> 18:02.960
And the phone signal around here
is a nightmare.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.400
Yeah, yeah, we noticed.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.720
Where were you pair off to, then?

18:09.120 --> 18:10.440
South Coast.

18:10.840 --> 18:14.240
Thought we'd chase away the weather
by the sea for a few days.

18:15.680 --> 18:18.800
Packing light in that case.

18:20.320 --> 18:23.720
We own a place. Everything,
it's down there waiting for us.

18:26.040 --> 18:30.040
- That must be nice.
- Yeah. Yeah, we're very lucky.

18:46.280 --> 18:50.120
Thank you. That was really quick.
Would have taken him forever.

18:50.440 --> 18:51.960
Ah, well.

18:53.120 --> 18:55.160
You know,
good to be of use for once.

18:55.720 --> 18:59.800
You're a credit to yourself. It's rare to
meet a real Samaritan these days.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.640
Well, you know...

19:02.760 --> 19:06.200
Safe journey, folks.
Hope that wheel doesn't fall off.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.560
Okay.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.000
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

19:23.800 --> 19:27.280
I'm just going to dispatch
with a quick call of nature here,

19:27.400 --> 19:29.840
but it was very nice meeting you both.

19:32.600 --> 19:36.920
You know what? I think I'll join you.
I've got a long drive ahead of me.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.080
You want to get
those crystals they have now.

19:40.200 --> 19:43.160
For long haul lorry drivers
and the like.

19:43.480 --> 19:44.680
Lorry driver crystals?

19:44.800 --> 19:48.440
Yeah, you just go into, like, a bag,
bucket, milk carton, whatever,

19:48.560 --> 19:50.400
and provided these crystals are in there,

19:50.520 --> 19:53.640
it just soaks up, never happened.
Like some sci-fi toilet.

19:54.320 --> 19:57.840
Is that a siren? Can you...
Can you hear that?

20:01.880 --> 20:04.120
I think you're hearing things, mate.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.640
Wouldn't be the first time.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.200
You all right?

20:30.040 --> 20:32.560
Yeah, I'm just trying to relax.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.360
So, what, you don't need
to go after all?

20:39.680 --> 20:42.440
It's the weirdest thing.
I guess not.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.760
Well, don't mind me.

20:45.400 --> 20:49.320
South Coast is a long drive
on a full bladder.

20:55.080 --> 20:56.560
Unless...

20:57.680 --> 21:00.840
Unless you followed me in here
for some other reason.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.400
Like what?

21:05.200 --> 21:06.840
You bloody tell me.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.880
You and your wife,
going on holiday,

21:14.800 --> 21:17.960
hanging out by the woods.
Pair of you in your tracksuits.

21:18.760 --> 21:22.280
And then you follow me into the trees
to take a piss, next to me...

21:23.760 --> 21:25.720
which you clearly
don't even need.

21:26.640 --> 21:29.640
It's almost like you're afraid
I'll find something.

21:32.240 --> 21:33.920
Where are the drugs, mate?

21:36.040 --> 21:38.480
- The what?
- I'm not a bloody idiot, am I?

21:38.920 --> 21:40.440
We've coutry lines
running left and center,

21:40.560 --> 21:43.080
and here you are, edge of the forest.

21:43.640 --> 21:47.200
You catch one sight of me and the pair
of you, you go bloody DEFCON 1.

21:47.320 --> 21:50.280
No, no, no. You don't understand.
We just had a flat tire, that's all.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.640
Yeah, weekend away
without so much as a backpack.

21:52.760 --> 21:55.800
I told you. Everything we need
is where we're going.

21:57.240 --> 21:59.920
Why don't you tell me
what you're up to?

22:06.040 --> 22:07.640
She's not my wife.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.760
- What?
- I'm going through a divorce.

22:11.280 --> 22:15.640
Well, more of a separation almost.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.240
But not quite?

22:22.120 --> 22:25.960
As in, the other half still doesn't know
what's about to hit her.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.240
No.

22:30.640 --> 22:34.600
I knew it. I could smell it.
I knew there was something up.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.360
- What do you mean?
- Why the big hoo-hah?

22:36.480 --> 22:38.200
I mean,
you don't know me from Adam.

22:38.520 --> 22:42.200
Well, neither of us feel particularly good
about it, that's all.

22:43.880 --> 22:46.840
- Well, there you go. Some honesty.
- No, no. The rest of it is all true.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.920
- It's just...
- The clothes doesn't bloody help.

22:49.040 --> 22:51.760
There's me thinking,
"greenhorns, new to the racket,

22:51.880 --> 22:54.560
"as yet clearly, very unsuccessful
drug dealers."

22:54.680 --> 22:56.520
As in, day one.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.880
Well, I suppose last time
I was single,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.360
this is what I thought was cool,
you know?

23:06.680 --> 23:09.720
My wife,
she left with the kids.

23:11.480 --> 23:14.000
- A few years back.
- Right.

23:16.280 --> 23:17.400
Sorry to hear that.

23:17.520 --> 23:21.880
Yeah, so I got myself
a pair of them harem pants.

23:22.360 --> 23:25.240
You know, them big ones.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.560
About six months in,
the boys from the pub,

23:31.680 --> 23:36.200
they turned up at my front door and
they... they literally made me burn them.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.360
- So...
- Yeah.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.040
Sorry about that.

24:04.480 --> 24:05.920
What the hell took you so long?

24:06.120 --> 24:09.880
That was insane.
That was absolutely insane.

24:10.680 --> 24:13.320
- I'm never leaving the house again.
- What about the dead guy?

24:13.960 --> 24:16.480
We're gonna have to
circle back in a minute.

24:20.480 --> 24:22.640
Oh, no, no. Not now.

24:28.240 --> 24:29.640
He's coming over.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.640
- Try again.
- I'm trying.

24:32.520 --> 24:33.760
Shit.

24:43.640 --> 24:46.280
Dear, oh, dear.
Not your day, is it?

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
No.

24:48.120 --> 24:51.760
Listen, I have a tow bar in the jeep,
have a tool in the boot.

24:52.080 --> 24:54.680
I could pull you into a garage in town.
My brother in law owns one.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.320
Oh, no, no, no,
don't worry about it. It's fine.

24:57.520 --> 24:58.720
What else am I gonna do?

24:58.960 --> 25:01.640
Leave you sat here for dead
but for the trees?

25:02.880 --> 25:05.600
Come on.
That's what we'll do. Okay?

25:16.480 --> 25:20.360
I told him we aren't married, by the way.
In case it comes up.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.960
Why risk killing the romance?

25:27.800 --> 25:29.160
You okay?

25:31.200 --> 25:32.640
Yeah.

25:33.520 --> 25:35.280
- You sure?
- Yeah.

25:39.080 --> 25:42.960
It's gonna feel different for me
after this weekend, I think.

25:46.040 --> 25:48.280
I don't want to go back
to the way it was.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.520
I feel like we've moved on,
don't you?

25:52.600 --> 25:56.480
Yeah, well, there's less at stake
for me. You've got Eve.

25:57.200 --> 26:00.680
- We've both got Beth.
- Yeah, don't need to remind me.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.600
I just feel happy
when I'm with you.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.640
Anyway, I don't remember
feeling this happy before.

26:11.280 --> 26:14.560
It sounds selfish,
but this seems simple.

26:15.760 --> 26:17.600
No? It seems

26:18.120 --> 26:20.760
simple and right,

26:21.600 --> 26:23.040
and big.

26:23.840 --> 26:25.120
To me, anyway.

26:25.720 --> 26:27.360
I know, I know.

26:32.040 --> 26:34.560
It's going to be a problem, though.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.040
Well, what should we do?

26:42.800 --> 26:45.000
What I think you're talking about doing

26:45.120 --> 26:49.160
with Eve and Beth and Jack
to contend with.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.000
It's gonna feel like hell.

26:57.760 --> 27:01.840
But you're right. It's gonna...
It's gonna feel different after this.

27:06.280 --> 27:08.320
Doesn't feel like a decision.

27:15.960 --> 27:18.240
- Do you think you can fix it?
- Maybe.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.640
Bloody amazed the thing's still running,
to be honest.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.720
He's a magician here, our Greg.

27:22.840 --> 27:26.480
That's just what us dyslexic mechanics
call ourselves on tax returns.

27:27.280 --> 27:28.480
Classic.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.360
Daphne wouldn't have dared
to marry him otherwise.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.800
Funny that.
The way I remember it,

27:32.920 --> 27:34.920
she didn't give me
much of a bloody choice.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.800
There's a couch over there.
Kettle and all that.

27:36.920 --> 27:39.520
You two go take a load off
while I take her apart.

27:39.640 --> 27:40.960
Sure.

27:41.680 --> 27:43.600
- How you doing, mate?
- Good.

28:09.320 --> 28:12.000
You all right?
Made yourself one, have ya?

28:12.320 --> 28:13.920
There's only one cup.

28:14.480 --> 28:17.400
How's it... How's it going?

28:17.920 --> 28:20.880
You know, not too much longer, mate.
Nearly done.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.840
I'll let you know.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.280
Sure.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.280
We can't stay here.

28:31.400 --> 28:34.440
Someone could walk past the body
while we're just sitting here.

28:34.560 --> 28:36.800
I might need you to jump in the front
and start it up in a minute.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.400
All right.
You think it'll turn over?

28:38.520 --> 28:40.480
- Oh, God.
- What?

28:41.880 --> 28:45.000
The gun's in the car door.
I forgot I put it there.

28:48.400 --> 28:50.000
What do we do?

29:03.720 --> 29:05.600
Wait, I have an idea.

29:08.560 --> 29:11.480
Excuse me. Could I use
your bathroom, please?

29:12.000 --> 29:13.680
It's right in there, love.

29:34.320 --> 29:37.200
- Hello?
- Hello, is this Greg Walker?

29:38.160 --> 29:39.160
Yeah. Who's this?

29:39.280 --> 29:44.320
Hi, this is Anita from the head office
of Euro Millions in sunny Rotterdam.

29:44.440 --> 29:46.760
- How are you today?
- I'm all right. How are you?

29:46.880 --> 29:49.640
I am really good, because
I have good news for you, Greg.

29:49.760 --> 29:54.400
- It seems that your wife, Daphne...
- I'm going to stop you there, sweetheart.

29:54.520 --> 29:56.880
My wife doesn't do
Euro Millions, so...

29:57.720 --> 30:00.200
Well, then you obviously don't know
your wife very well,

30:00.320 --> 30:04.200
because she, behind your back,
bought a winning ticket, Greg.

30:04.520 --> 30:06.800
For a very,
very large sum of money.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.280
Fuck off.

30:08.400 --> 30:11.400
Yes, I understand
that you are very excited.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.920
Yeah. Yeah, no, no, I'm listening.
Go on.

30:16.840 --> 30:19.080
But before I give you
the millions of euros,

30:19.320 --> 30:22.880
is there someone maybe that can
confirm that you're Greg Walker?

30:23.000 --> 30:25.040
Someone like an official person,

30:25.160 --> 30:28.560
like a solicitor,
or someone from the politics.

30:28.680 --> 30:30.320
Maybe like a policeman,

30:30.440 --> 30:33.520
or someone that can confirm
that you're Greg Walker.

30:33.640 --> 30:36.720
My brother-in-law is here.
He's a policeman.

30:37.560 --> 30:39.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:50.240 --> 30:54.440
Yeah.
Sorry. Sorry, say that again.

30:54.960 --> 30:56.920
Is the person
next to you Greg Walker?

30:57.080 --> 30:59.480
Yes, I can absolutely confirm.
Yeah, he's my brother-in-law, actually.

30:59.600 --> 31:01.760
- Greg.
- Can you bring him back on?

31:04.080 --> 31:07.240
- Hello? Greg here.
- Hi, Greg, it's me again...

31:07.360 --> 31:11.040
... you're actually Greg Walker, because
otherwise I will give it to some idiot.

31:11.200 --> 31:15.080
Greg, let me scroll through
to see how much money it is actually.

31:18.600 --> 31:22.360
My computer is very slow today. Yes,
we have not updated the version of...

31:22.480 --> 31:24.080
- Yep.
- Okay, hold on.

31:25.640 --> 31:29.000
Let me see.
Yes, 17 million euro!

31:29.200 --> 31:31.880
Seventeen million. Seventeen!

31:56.600 --> 31:59.480
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- Yeah.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.520
I'll tell her tomorrow night
after dinner.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.680
There's no point in waiting.

32:11.640 --> 32:13.760
There is another option, though.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.560
What's that?

32:17.000 --> 32:18.640
We just keep on going.

32:19.600 --> 32:22.600
Just turn our phones off
and just keep on driving.

32:33.480 --> 32:36.520
Okay, think again.
Are you sure it was from there?

32:37.800 --> 32:42.240
Yeah, sure as anyone can be
that one craggy outcrop in the dark

32:42.360 --> 32:45.080
isn't a different
craggy outcrop in the dark.

32:47.160 --> 32:50.160
We'll be lucky if the foxes
haven't started eating him.

32:50.280 --> 32:52.680
Well, they're fucking welcome to him.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.720
- You okay?
- Yeah. Found him.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.920
- No, no, no, no.
- I'm sorry.

33:14.080 --> 33:15.760
Sorry. Yeah.

33:16.440 --> 33:18.000
I mean, now?

33:18.600 --> 33:20.920
Here? What the fuck?

33:22.320 --> 33:25.600
Are you crazy?
What the hell is wrong with you?

33:25.720 --> 33:27.320
I don't know. I, uh...

33:28.280 --> 33:30.280
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

33:33.240 --> 33:35.360
You want to take the head
or the feet?

33:37.080 --> 33:38.480
The feet.

33:45.480 --> 33:47.480
One, two, three.

34:05.920 --> 34:08.320
I shouldn't have just done that.
I'm sorry.

34:17.200 --> 34:19.440
I wish to God
more than anything...

34:20.840 --> 34:22.160
I wish we just...

34:24.040 --> 34:26.880
kept on driving that time
like you said we should.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.920
None of what I told you about
how I felt back then

34:33.600 --> 34:35.080
was a lie.

34:38.560 --> 34:40.880
The feelings I told you I had...

34:43.320 --> 34:45.360
I still have those feelings.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.400
Drive the car.

35:13.480 --> 35:14.480
Oh, jeez!

35:14.600 --> 35:16.280
- What's that?
- Shit!

35:21.240 --> 35:23.000
Shit!

35:25.160 --> 35:27.640
Shit! Out of the car.
Get out of the car.

35:53.440 --> 35:55.440
- What is that?
- A fucking rag.

36:01.040 --> 36:02.880
You okay?

36:25.320 --> 36:27.640
Oh, Jesus.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.560
Come on! Come on!

36:41.560 --> 36:44.000
Daniel!
We need to get real.

36:45.600 --> 36:48.120
I mean, look at us.
We're fucked!

36:50.840 --> 36:54.280
Look at us. Look at everything
that's happened today.

36:55.160 --> 36:58.920
Fate obviously doesn't want us to reach
that cottage. We can't pull this off.

36:59.040 --> 37:00.400
- Yes, we can.
- How?

37:00.720 --> 37:03.720
- We can, okay?
- But this is not who we are.

37:04.400 --> 37:05.840
I can fix this.

37:06.760 --> 37:09.200
I can't... I'm tired. I...

37:09.800 --> 37:12.920
I can't do this anymore. I'm too tired.
I just want to call the police.

37:13.040 --> 37:14.640
I'm not gonna let you do that.

37:14.920 --> 37:16.920
You're not talking the fall for a death
that's not your fault.

37:17.040 --> 37:19.240
I don't think I'm giving you a choice.

37:20.960 --> 37:24.920
Everything that's happened has
happened, and now we need to face it.

37:27.760 --> 37:30.440
Neither of us are people
who know how to do this.

37:32.240 --> 37:36.880
There's no magic lever we can pull that
will make this all go away. All of this!

37:43.160 --> 37:44.640
What if there was?

37:45.600 --> 37:47.240
What if there was what?

37:49.160 --> 37:51.120
What if there was something
that'll make it all go away?

37:51.240 --> 37:52.800
For fuck's sake.

37:59.960 --> 38:01.880
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

38:40.560 --> 38:43.280
Gubby? It's Daniel.

38:43.760 --> 38:46.000
Daniel, how nice to hear from you.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.080
I need a favor.

38:54.160 --> 38:58.160
What if this guy wants a favor back?

39:04.320 --> 39:06.840
Why put yourself in that position?

39:13.960 --> 39:15.440
For you.

39:17.880 --> 39:19.280
It's for you.

39:39.520 --> 39:41.000
Taxi.

39:42.800 --> 39:44.680
I'll be out in a second.

40:40.560 --> 40:41.880
Hello?

40:43.760 --> 40:45.360
Hello?

40:48.960 --> 40:50.600
Lee?

40:53.680 --> 40:55.200
Lee?

41:32.240 --> 41:34.960
You have one message.

41:36.600 --> 41:38.960
Dad, I'm at the police station.

41:40.440 --> 41:42.400
I think...

41:43.360 --> 41:46.360
I think they're going
to charge me with murder.
