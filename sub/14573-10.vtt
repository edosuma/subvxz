00:01.535 --> 00:08.008
**

00:37.805 --> 00:41.809
**

00:46.747 --> 00:49.250
(door banging open)

01:07.768 --> 01:13.073
**

01:45.473 --> 01:48.008
So you-- you took a chance

01:48.041 --> 01:51.111
on being happy, even though
you knew that later on

01:51.145 --> 01:52.346
you would be sad.

01:52.380 --> 01:53.747
Yeah.

01:53.781 --> 01:56.116
And now... you're sad.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.520
Yeah.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.522
So...

02:01.555 --> 02:04.792
What, what, what's
the problem?

02:04.825 --> 02:09.463
I'm too sad.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.932
Look, I...

02:11.965 --> 02:16.704
I liked the feeling of being in
love with her, I liked it.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.872
But now she's gone
and I miss her and it sucks.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.541
And I didn't think it
was gonna be this bad,

02:20.574 --> 02:22.843
and I feel like,
why even be happy,

02:22.876 --> 02:25.112
if it's just gonna
lead to this?

02:25.145 --> 02:27.715
It's wasn't--
it wasn't worth it.

02:27.748 --> 02:31.519
Boy, misery is wasted
on the miserable.

02:33.187 --> 02:35.323
What?

02:35.356 --> 02:38.226
You know, I'm not...

02:38.259 --> 02:39.960
...entirely sure what
your name is,

02:39.993 --> 02:42.563
but you are a classic idiot.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.898
You think spending time
with her, kissing her,

02:44.932 --> 02:47.701
having fun with her, you think
that's what it was all about?

02:47.735 --> 02:49.303
That was love?

02:49.337 --> 02:51.505
Yeah.

02:51.539 --> 02:55.008
This is love, missing her.

02:55.042 --> 02:57.144
Because she's gone,

02:57.177 --> 03:00.314
wanting to die,
you're... so lucky.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.715
You're like a walking poem.

03:01.749 --> 03:04.652
Would you rather be some
kind of a... a fantasy?

03:04.685 --> 03:08.021
Some kind of
a, a, a Disney ride?

03:08.055 --> 03:10.224
Is that what you want?

03:10.258 --> 03:11.992
Don't you see, this
is the good part.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.195
This is what you've been
digging for all this time.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.164
Now you finally have it
in your hand,

03:17.197 --> 03:20.000
this sweet nugget of love.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.836
Sweet, sad love and you
wanna throw it away.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.873
You've got it all wrong.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.678
I thought this was
the bad part.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.246
No!

03:32.280 --> 03:35.182
The bad part is when
you forget her.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.950
When you don't
care about her.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.719
When you don't
care about anything.

03:38.752 --> 03:42.556
The bad part is coming
so enjoy the heartbreak

03:42.590 --> 03:45.726
while you can,
for God sakes.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.796
Pick-- here, pick, pick up
the dog poop, would you please?

03:48.829 --> 03:50.364
Lucky son of a bitch,

03:50.398 --> 03:52.400
I haven't had my heart
broken since Marilyn

03:52.433 --> 03:56.136
walked out on me since
I was... I was 35 years old.

03:56.169 --> 04:00.574
What I would give to have
that feeling again.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.176
You know?

04:05.513 --> 04:07.615
I'm not really sure what
your name is but you,

04:07.648 --> 04:08.949
you may be

04:08.982 --> 04:13.654
the single
most boring person

04:13.687 --> 04:16.557
I have ever met.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.258
No offense, give me
my dog, come here.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.494
You, you, you've, uh...

04:20.528 --> 04:22.563
Don't fall down.

04:22.596 --> 04:26.300
**

04:32.640 --> 04:34.708
(cell phone beeping)

05:01.902 --> 05:03.837
(horn honking)

05:05.406 --> 05:08.476
Look, um, look, the last
time that I saw you...

05:10.077 --> 05:11.479
you told me that you

05:11.512 --> 05:13.381
were interested
in maybe pursuing

05:13.414 --> 05:15.015
like a guy, girl
thing with...

05:19.052 --> 05:21.722
Well, so, I was
thinking about it.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.524
And, uh--

05:23.557 --> 05:25.292
Oh...

05:25.325 --> 05:28.228
Oh, so the, the thing
with that lady,

05:28.261 --> 05:30.831
it didn't work out and now
you've come sniffing around me.

05:30.864 --> 05:34.902
Is that the basic outline
of... this thing here?

05:38.939 --> 05:40.908
Yeah, that's
basically it.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.344
Well, sorry.

05:44.378 --> 05:45.913
Ticket's no
longer available.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.882
That ship has sailed,
the option is closed.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.250
But you said that
I got under your skin

05:50.283 --> 05:51.852
and that you were
thinking of us--

05:51.885 --> 05:54.488
Yeah, that was before,
and you didn't bite.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.056
The cookie is gone.

05:58.559 --> 06:01.361
Jesus, why are you
so mean to me?

06:02.362 --> 06:03.697
Why do you like it?

06:06.066 --> 06:07.601
Okay, okay.

06:07.635 --> 06:08.736
But you said--

06:08.769 --> 06:10.070
(cell phone ringing)

06:10.103 --> 06:11.204
Oh.

06:11.238 --> 06:13.006
Oh, yeah, you
better get that.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.242
Maybe it's your balls calling
from wherever they went.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.410
(mocking laugh)

06:16.444 --> 06:17.678
Heh-heh.

06:17.711 --> 06:18.879
Shut up.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.881
Hello?

06:20.914 --> 06:24.051
Hi, Mrs. Frame.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.787
Okay, that's fine.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.756
Oh-- what, you--

06:30.558 --> 06:32.025
Yeah, but you s--

06:32.059 --> 06:34.294
Oh.

06:34.327 --> 06:36.730
Yeah, I mean, thanks
for letting me know.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.735
Yeah.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.571
Great, great.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.072
What?

06:45.105 --> 06:46.540
My-- my babysitter just
cancelled.

06:46.574 --> 06:48.909
I have two shows tonight
and I have the kids.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.912
So, I'll watch your girls,
go do your shows.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.647
Are you being serious?

06:53.681 --> 06:55.215
Yeah.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.417
No problem.
Thank you, thank you.

06:57.451 --> 06:58.919
(man)
I don't give
a shit who he is.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.320
He stole from us and now
he's out there working?

07:00.353 --> 07:01.922
That's not gonna fly.

07:01.955 --> 07:02.956
(man)
That's what I said.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.124
I'm not
tolerating it.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.893
So what are
you gonna do?

07:05.926 --> 07:08.328
He's fucking dead,
that's what I'm doing.

07:08.361 --> 07:09.463
You wanna
go that way?

07:09.497 --> 07:10.464
Yeah, I wanna
go that way.

07:10.498 --> 07:11.799
He's dead.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.901
Who do you wanna--
I'll do it myself.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.604
Meet me there
at 12:00 and, uh,

07:16.637 --> 07:18.071
you can help me
get rid of him.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.339
(laughing)

07:19.372 --> 07:21.809
Your face!
Shut up,
shut up, Jesus!

07:26.647 --> 07:27.815
(Pamela)
Oh!

07:30.017 --> 07:31.852
How many people here--
okay, by applause,

07:31.885 --> 07:33.687
think that you are going--
if you're going to heaven,

07:33.721 --> 07:35.322
applaud if you think
you're going to heaven, anybody?

07:35.355 --> 07:36.490
(scattered applause)

07:36.524 --> 07:38.358
Couple of people-- few people.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.628
Yeah, you think
you're going to heaven?

07:40.661 --> 07:42.329
How old, how old are you?

07:42.362 --> 07:43.831
(woman)
28.
You're 28

07:43.864 --> 07:46.834
and already...
you're a lock for heaven,

07:46.867 --> 07:50.971
you're totally--
already at 28.

07:51.004 --> 07:56.176
You've done enough good in your
ten adult years

07:56.209 --> 07:59.379
that you couldn't possibly make
a mistake that's gonna--

07:59.412 --> 08:02.683
Oh, no, that's--
well, enjoy it.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.484
I hope you like-- I don't think
there's a heaven.

08:04.518 --> 08:05.986
I think there
may be a God

08:06.019 --> 08:07.788
but I don't think
there's a heaven.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.823
I think that's the best news
you're gonna get.

08:09.857 --> 08:12.325
When this is over,
is you-- hey, God?

08:12.359 --> 08:13.694
And He's like, "Yup."

08:13.727 --> 08:15.495
And you're like,
"Where's heaven?"

08:15.529 --> 08:17.030
And He's like, "I don't know
who told you that shit.

08:17.064 --> 08:19.199
"That's crazy.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.901
"What, you think
I made a whole universe

08:20.934 --> 08:24.471
"and then a whole
other amazing place

08:24.504 --> 08:27.340
"forever after that?

08:27.374 --> 08:30.277
How much do you
want from me?!"

08:33.714 --> 08:35.182
"So where do I go?"

08:35.215 --> 08:36.750
"Just stand in this room."

08:39.920 --> 08:41.555
"I don't like it."
"How do you think I feel?

08:41.589 --> 08:43.090
I've been here
since 1982."

08:47.861 --> 08:50.764
I like the idea that there is
a God but only since 1982.

08:52.232 --> 08:55.769
Like, He started in 1982.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.404
And what did
He even do?

08:57.437 --> 09:00.708
The "Back to the Future" movies,
uh, He worked on those.

09:00.741 --> 09:04.211
Otherwise, He's been
pretty much the same.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.779
I don't know if
there is a God.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.581
That's all I think you
can say, honestly.

09:07.615 --> 09:09.617
I mean, you could say there is
a God if you believe in it.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.952
That's-- you could just get to
say it 'cause you believe it.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.520
You can't argue with
somebody's beliefs.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.521
"I believe in God."

09:14.554 --> 09:15.689
"No, you don't."

09:15.723 --> 09:17.557
"Yes."

09:17.591 --> 09:19.860
I mean, it's faith, it's not
science, it's faith.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.695
I envy people who have faith,

09:21.729 --> 09:23.631
that wake up in the morning
and there He is.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.799
They're like, "Ooh, hi!

09:25.833 --> 09:27.968
That's so nice that
you came again today."

09:28.001 --> 09:29.737
He's always there.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.905
I don't have that,
I wake up and there's nobody.

09:31.939 --> 09:35.909
It's just my bad breath
and my garlic penis.

09:35.943 --> 09:39.112
It's-- it used to be
at least a boner that--

09:39.146 --> 09:40.480
all right, let's get going.

09:40.513 --> 09:41.548
But it's just...
(blowing raspberry).

09:41.581 --> 09:42.816
So...

09:45.452 --> 09:47.587
But I don't think you can say
that there's no God, uh,

09:47.621 --> 09:49.156
'cause that
takes a lot of--

09:49.189 --> 09:51.258
boy, that takes a lot
of confidence

09:51.291 --> 09:54.427
to say, "Nope, there's no--
definitely not a God."

09:54.461 --> 09:55.428
"How do you know?"

09:55.462 --> 09:57.330
"Just 'cause, uh...

09:57.364 --> 09:59.667
"doesn't seem
like there's one.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.302
So... uh, there's
not one."

10:04.604 --> 10:07.808
How can a human being
think that they know

10:07.841 --> 10:09.977
that there
isn't anything?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.344
I mean, you're a human--

10:11.378 --> 10:14.848
you can see for
a hundred yards, tops.

10:14.882 --> 10:17.584
How could you possibly know...

10:17.617 --> 10:21.021
God might be right behind you
all the time, just like...

10:24.057 --> 10:26.093
I think if there is a God,
it's probably not the one

10:26.126 --> 10:27.661
the way they
describe Him in the Bible.

10:27.695 --> 10:30.698
They say He's our father
and we're his children.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.833
That's a weird story.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.835
He's our father
and we're His children.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.470
Where is our mother?

10:37.504 --> 10:39.973
How could we--
how could we not--

10:40.007 --> 10:42.710
what did He do to our mom?

10:42.743 --> 10:46.714
Something happened.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.115
Somewhere in heaven
there's a porch

10:48.148 --> 10:49.817
with a dead lady under it.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.458
I think, I think, God-- it was,
uh, if there is a God,

10:58.491 --> 11:01.829
I'd-- at the-- at
the least, he has an ex-wife.

11:01.862 --> 11:05.198
Maybe that's what it is,
God's divorced.

11:05.232 --> 11:08.802
And it's a-- we're in-- like,
this is our weekend with God.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.203
It feel like a long time,

11:10.237 --> 11:12.539
but this is just our
weekend with Dad,

11:12.572 --> 11:16.043
and then he's gonna
take us to Mom's apartment.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.878
And she's gonna be sitting
there kind of nervous.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.847
"I made you a cheese sandwich."

11:19.880 --> 11:22.716
And we're like,
"I don't know you, bitch."

11:22.750 --> 11:25.685
And, uh, it feels weird.

11:25.719 --> 11:28.588
I think that, uh,
I think that we made God a man

11:28.621 --> 11:32.192
because we wanted men to be in
charge, so it made sense.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.161
'Cause it doesn't make
sense that men are in charge.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.563
It makes sense that women
would be in charge.

11:36.596 --> 11:39.833
Because your mom is the first
person who takes care of you.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.870
So how-- you'd have-- it would
just make sense that mothers

11:42.903 --> 11:46.273
would run the world, and, uh,
they don't-- it's the opposite.

11:46.306 --> 11:49.743
So we have this weird system of,
uh, you know, men being--

11:49.777 --> 11:51.511
It's kind of upside down.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.380
I think the reason is
'cause women were in charge

11:53.413 --> 11:55.916
long time ago and they were
really mean.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.717
They were horrible.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.753
And they would--
you had to walk around naked

11:59.787 --> 12:02.122
and they'd flick your penis
and laugh at you.

12:02.155 --> 12:06.093
So we're so scared of them.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.394
And then finally, one guy
punched a woman

12:07.427 --> 12:08.762
and she was like, "Whaa!"

12:08.796 --> 12:10.097
And he's like,
"We can hit them!"

12:10.130 --> 12:11.231
And then that was it.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.266
That was it.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.768
And so now

12:14.802 --> 12:18.105
we're so afraid
of women, that's why--

12:18.138 --> 12:21.108
'cause women are really kept
down, uh, even today.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.742
Uh, a lot of people like to
argue that things are equal,

12:22.776 --> 12:24.411
but they're really not.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.713
And American history hasn't
been kind to women.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.749
Women couldn't vote till
1920, how crazy is that?

12:29.783 --> 12:33.553
That women couldn't vote in
America till 1920.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.888
Do you know who
the first President is...

12:34.922 --> 12:36.289
that women voted for?

12:36.323 --> 12:37.791
It was Mike Chapritemps,
I don't know.

12:37.825 --> 12:40.293
Uh, I have no idea, but, uh...

12:42.529 --> 12:43.897
They couldn't vote till 1920

12:43.931 --> 12:46.066
which means America
wasn't really

12:46.099 --> 12:48.068
a democracy until 1920.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.904
You can't call
it a democracy

12:50.938 --> 12:54.774
if the whole sex
of women can't vote.

12:54.808 --> 12:58.979
That's-- Jimmy Carter would not
sanction that election.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.747
That you would
let zero women vote.

13:00.780 --> 13:04.451
That means American democracy is
really 93 years old.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.419
That's really how old it is.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.957
There are people in my building
older than American democracy.

13:13.326 --> 13:17.430
Women-- until recently, a woman
was just her husband's property.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.200
Her name was Mrs. Fred Johnson.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.969
That's what
a woman's name was.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.503
Not even Lori Johnson.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.305
She was
Mrs. Fred Johnson.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.639
Like, "What's your name?"

13:26.673 --> 13:28.341
"Fred Johnson (bleep) me
occasionally."

13:28.375 --> 13:29.943
"Really, that's, that's..."

13:29.977 --> 13:31.244
"Yeah."

13:34.414 --> 13:36.884
Guys used to-- a lot of guys
still beat their wives.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.986
But it used to be
totally okay.

13:39.019 --> 13:42.122
At least now
it's frowned upon.

13:42.155 --> 13:46.159
And really, that's about it,
just, hmm, just frowning.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.727
That's what we do about it.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.998
But it was so okay to beat your
wife until so recently,

13:51.031 --> 13:54.234
that there's a kind
of shirt named after it.

13:54.267 --> 13:57.237
We have a kind of shirt

13:57.270 --> 13:59.907
that we
affectionately nicknamed

13:59.940 --> 14:04.544
after beating the shit out of
your helpless, captive wife.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.679
And everybody uses this name.

14:06.713 --> 14:08.148
I was watching
"Good Morning America."

14:08.181 --> 14:09.349
This cute woman was like,

14:09.382 --> 14:11.184
"So I was wearing
a wife beater."

14:11.218 --> 14:14.988
Stop saying it like it doesn't
mean anything.

14:15.022 --> 14:19.726
"I was wearing a wife beater
and child murder shorts.

14:19.759 --> 14:23.530
And I looked so cute!"

14:27.567 --> 14:29.569
(train rattling)

14:29.602 --> 14:31.204
(man)
I told him, I said this is--

14:31.238 --> 14:33.773
this is the last time I will
allow that to happen,

14:33.806 --> 14:35.442
'cause I'm not--

14:35.475 --> 14:39.746
I'm not born to sit there
and listen to that.

14:39.779 --> 14:42.549
Sit there and lie, you know?

14:42.582 --> 14:44.451
That's not why I'm here.

14:44.484 --> 14:47.955
And, and, and I got two weeks to
get it straight, two weeks.

14:47.988 --> 14:51.424
That's, that's like... it's
practically impossible.

14:51.458 --> 14:54.394
You gotta line everything up.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.763
And then-- that's
the last time, I told him.

14:56.796 --> 14:58.898
I said, "That's it,
that's it."

14:58.932 --> 15:00.968
Last straw, you know?

15:01.001 --> 15:02.102
(sighing)

15:02.135 --> 15:04.771
(subway door opening)

15:04.804 --> 15:08.441
You know, 25 percent of
them are liars,

15:08.475 --> 15:10.543
that is a scientific fact.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.045
They're liars, there's
no reason to believe

15:12.079 --> 15:13.646
anything they tell you.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.282
I'm gonna look out for my
own interests.

15:15.315 --> 15:16.950
That's what makes sense to me.

15:16.984 --> 15:19.752
You know, I mean, you know, I'm
not gonna sit there

15:19.786 --> 15:21.588
and let them keep
talking to me like that

15:21.621 --> 15:24.992
and lying to everybody, right?

15:25.025 --> 15:28.161
I'm gonna, you know-- there's
only so much I can take.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.163
They pushed me too far.

15:30.197 --> 15:32.099
And too far is too far.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.802
(lock rattling)

16:07.734 --> 16:10.837
Please don't start
jerking off, I'm awake.

16:10.870 --> 16:13.106
Oh.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.774
Um...

16:14.807 --> 16:17.044
Hey.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.812
Um, was everything
okay with the kids?

16:19.846 --> 16:22.082
No, they're both dead.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.120
I'll see you later.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.222
Okay, well...

16:29.256 --> 16:31.624
Your kids
are great, by the way.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.693
They're both better than...
(laughing) Jesus.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.195
Well, I--

16:35.228 --> 16:38.798
No, no, stupid.
All right,
I'm sorry.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.967
Listen, I, uh...

16:41.000 --> 16:42.335
What are you coming ov--?

16:42.369 --> 16:43.470
Look, no, no,
it's oh-- I just...

16:43.503 --> 16:46.139
Okay, well, bye, now.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.174
Pamela.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.309
No, bye-bye.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.477
Bye, now.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.544
Pamela.

16:51.578 --> 16:52.545
Louie--
I just wanna--

16:52.579 --> 16:53.646
I'm really late for...

16:53.680 --> 16:55.248
not being in
here right now.

16:55.282 --> 16:58.985
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
look, listen, I'm, I'm--

16:59.018 --> 17:00.753
What, no, no-no-no!

17:00.787 --> 17:02.155
Just--
No!

17:02.189 --> 17:03.556
Come on, come on.

17:03.590 --> 17:04.591
No.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.693
Come on.
No.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.328
Come on.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.529
Just--

17:09.562 --> 17:11.331
No, I don't like that.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.100
I just--

17:13.133 --> 17:16.203
Oh, my God!

17:16.236 --> 17:19.106
This would be rape if you
weren't so stupid!

17:19.139 --> 17:21.674
God, you can't
even rape well.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.211
(panting)

17:27.114 --> 17:29.949
Hey, listen to me-- hey.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.751
Look at me.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.320
Please?

17:35.822 --> 17:40.093
You-- you said you
wanted to do something with me.

17:40.127 --> 17:43.263
And I don't believe you
that the ship has sailed.

17:44.797 --> 17:47.634
See? You want
to do some--

17:47.667 --> 17:50.637
You wanna try something but you
don't... know-- you can't,

17:50.670 --> 17:53.573
for some reason,
you can't.

17:53.606 --> 17:57.310
So I'm gonna take control.

17:57.344 --> 18:00.313
And I'm gonna make
something happen.

18:00.347 --> 18:04.484
You said you wanted to be--
do-- be in a thing.

18:04.517 --> 18:07.654
Yeah, but does kissing
have to be in it?

18:07.687 --> 18:10.557
Yeah, that's 'cause people,
that's a people-- do that.

18:10.590 --> 18:11.891
People do that, okay?

18:11.924 --> 18:14.394
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna
kiss you now.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.829
Ew.

18:16.863 --> 18:20.167
Okay, I'm gonna--
Maybe, I don't know.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.935
I'm gonna do--
I'm gonna do it, okay?

18:22.969 --> 18:23.970
Oh.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.338
Okay.
Hurry up.

18:25.372 --> 18:26.773
Here I go.

18:37.049 --> 18:39.186
Okay.

18:39.219 --> 18:42.722
Thank you for...
the that.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.860
Sorry.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.496
Okay, bye now.

18:51.531 --> 18:56.469
(panting)

18:56.503 --> 18:57.970
Yes.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.655
Okay, where
are we now?

19:15.688 --> 19:17.357
What?

19:17.390 --> 19:19.192
Where are we?

19:19.226 --> 19:21.994
On the bus.

19:22.028 --> 19:25.131
Lily, you're gonna be taking
this bus alone soon.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.400
You need to be aware.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.636
What if the bus
broke down right now?

19:29.669 --> 19:31.404
And you had to get off,
where would you be?

19:31.438 --> 19:33.540
It didn't break down
so it's fine.

19:33.573 --> 19:37.043
Just, please,
look out the window.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.678
We're at 23rd Street.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.247
Good.
So?

19:40.280 --> 19:42.715
Okay, so... so what
street is your school on?

19:42.749 --> 19:44.150
28.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.818
28, okay, so if
you're at 23rd Street

19:45.852 --> 19:47.387
and you have to
get to 28th Street...

19:47.420 --> 19:50.189
Daddy, is Pamela lady
your girlfriend now?

19:51.358 --> 19:52.859
What?

19:52.892 --> 19:54.394
Is Pamela
your girlfriend?

19:57.797 --> 19:59.399
No.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.900
But...

20:00.933 --> 20:03.403
Who's gonna pick us up
from school today?

20:03.436 --> 20:04.737
Your--
(clearing throat)

20:04.771 --> 20:07.240
Your mom.

20:07.274 --> 20:08.575
Daddy.
What?

20:08.608 --> 20:10.109
Is Pamela your
girlfriend now?

20:13.079 --> 20:15.448
Listen, girls...

20:15.482 --> 20:17.417
Okay, when
you're with me...

20:17.450 --> 20:18.685
Yeah?

20:18.718 --> 20:20.453
And then you're
with your mom,

20:20.487 --> 20:24.056
and you talk about
when you were with me.

20:24.090 --> 20:27.427
You want us to lie
to Mom about Pamela.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.068
Jesus Christ, hey,
buddy, hey, hey!

20:36.102 --> 20:37.470
Don't spit on the bus,
what's wrong with you?

20:37.504 --> 20:39.706
Come on, shut up, man.

20:39.739 --> 20:43.376
No, I won't, you're-- this is
a community bus, you don't spit.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.445
I thought I said shut up, you
trying to disrespect me?

20:45.478 --> 20:47.580
I-- yes, I am,
because you spit.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.449
Stay over there, man.
I am over here and that's
a disgusting...

20:49.482 --> 20:50.917
(man)
Hey, hey, hey!

20:50.950 --> 20:52.485
Hey, what's the commotion
back there?!

20:52.519 --> 20:55.622
Yo, this guy back here
spit on the bus, man.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.690
Don't spit on my bus!

21:00.259 --> 21:04.797
**

21:24.216 --> 21:26.653
(metal rattling)

21:26.686 --> 21:28.988
(record skipping)
