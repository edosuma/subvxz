You know, the mere fact that
you and your agents are here

we are not allowed to do.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.518
Because you won't help.

You've done nothing but fight me on this.

And now, now you want unfettered access

to undermine since the very beginning.

I don't want-- I <i>need</i> access, Wendy.

15:07.489 --> 15:08.490
We need access.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.869
We have made promises
to our shareholders about this casino,

15:11.952 --> 15:15.122
and I don't think-- I don't think we want
to annoy our shareholders.

15:15.205 --> 15:16.790
What would you have me do?

15:17.166 --> 15:19.543
[Wendy] I don't feel very compelled
to help you right now.

15:19.627 --> 15:22.296
I just had a very interesting conversation
with Frank.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.090
From Kansas City.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.133
Oh, yeah?

15:26.800 --> 15:27.676
Hmm.

15:28.552 --> 15:29.762
And you do...

15:30.220 --> 15:31.931
you do realize

15:32.014 --> 15:35.142
what a magnificently stupid

15:35.225 --> 15:39.063
and dangerous thing it was that you did
in Kansas, right?

15:39.897 --> 15:42.024
I pleaded with you, "Please don't do this.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.860
Please do not get us further in on this."
Remember that?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.695
Yeah. And because you didn't
get your way,

15:46.779 --> 15:48.322
you went behind my back to sabotage me.

15:48.405 --> 15:51.659
I was trying to protect our family, Wendy.
That's it.

15:51.742 --> 15:52.701
That is such--

15:52.785 --> 15:54.870
That is such a tired...

15:55.079 --> 15:57.206
-Is it? Okay.
-...tired excuse.

15:57.289 --> 16:00.668
Yeah. You know what you like to do?
You like to control your family.

16:00.751 --> 16:03.879
I'm asking you for fucking help
on a problem that you created,

16:03.963 --> 16:05.172
and you're not helping.

16:05.297 --> 16:06.882
That's the whole story.

16:07.466 --> 16:08.509
To you.

16:09.843 --> 16:11.929
-[sighs]
-[Sue] Let's pause there.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.223
-[stammers] Marty.
-Yeah.

16:14.306 --> 16:17.101
What would it look like
to achieve your objectives

16:17.184 --> 16:20.521
without interfering with Wendy's project?

16:22.231 --> 16:24.233
I think that that would look like death.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.361
[Sue] But what would it really look like?

16:29.321 --> 16:30.948
-Really death.
-[Sue] Okay.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.451
Marty, my mother had a saying.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.747
"Just like a pie is only
as good as its crust,

16:39.331 --> 16:43.419
a marriage is only as good as its trust."

16:43.877 --> 16:46.505
Going behind Wendy's back

16:46.588 --> 16:50.342
on a project that
is obviously meaningful to her

16:50.426 --> 16:52.386
violates that trust.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.513
Wendy is a powerful woman,

16:55.014 --> 16:58.559
and it's your responsibility
to nurture that, Marty.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.894
Not stifle it.

17:07.443 --> 17:11.280
What the hell was that? Hey, Sue!
What the hell was that?

17:12.448 --> 17:14.575
You told me to let her win a couple.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.452
Small things.

17:16.910 --> 17:19.371
-Small.
-I thought she was right.

17:19.455 --> 17:20.706
I don't give a fuck.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.083
You're yelling at me.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.918
Well, I'm angry, okay?

17:25.002 --> 17:28.172
Yes, Marty, you are.

17:28.338 --> 17:30.966
There is something deeper at play here.

17:31.425 --> 17:35.137
And I believe that you and Wendy
can be happy...

17:35.429 --> 17:37.431
if you let me help you.

17:37.514 --> 17:39.808
Save it. I'm not bribing you
to make us happy.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.438
[door opens, closes]

18:00.037 --> 18:03.082
So, uh... [clears throat]
...what did everyone do today?

18:07.294 --> 18:08.921
Okay... [clears throat]

18:09.213 --> 18:10.255
I'll start.

18:11.381 --> 18:14.468
Jonah took me to the caves.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.304
He jumped in the water.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.681
You let him jump in cave water?

18:19.765 --> 18:21.475
Who's gonna stop me?

18:21.558 --> 18:23.310
-[Jonah scoffs]
-[Charlotte] Well, how was it?

18:24.186 --> 18:27.940
It was not good.
It was very scary and disgusting.

18:28.023 --> 18:30.067
-[Charlotte] Mm-hmm.
-[cell phone ringing]

18:30.150 --> 18:31.652
Anybody know any jokes?

18:32.778 --> 18:33.862
I should get this.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.781
[Ben] Saved by the bell.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.785
Lucky bastard.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.164
Hello?

18:45.124 --> 18:46.416
[Navarro] <i>I'm interrupting.</i>

18:48.544 --> 18:49.878
No, no, not at all.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.840
<i>Yes, yes, I'm interrupting your dinner.</i>

18:53.465 --> 18:57.052
But not that I'm spying on you
or anything, it's just...

18:57.594 --> 19:00.055
it is, uh-- it's dinnertime there, no?

19:02.516 --> 19:03.600
[laughs] Yes.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.894
[laughs] <i>Did you cook?</i>

19:06.895 --> 19:07.813
Yes.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.524
<i>-Good.</i>
-[both laugh]

19:10.607 --> 19:11.650
<i>What did you make?</i>

19:11.775 --> 19:12.776
Chicken.

19:14.069 --> 19:16.363
Chicken roasted with vegetables.

19:17.698 --> 19:20.200
Well, I imagine you are pretty good
in the kitchen, no?

19:21.451 --> 19:22.494
[chuckles]

19:25.038 --> 19:26.832
We are very close on the hotel.

19:28.917 --> 19:31.879
<i>Wendy, my girlfriend</i>
<i>had a baby the other day.</i>

19:32.671 --> 19:34.631
<i>Uh, Santiago...</i>

19:35.507 --> 19:37.092
<i>named after her grandfather.</i>

19:39.136 --> 19:40.304
That's wonderful.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.182
It's a wonderful name, it's a very...

19:43.265 --> 19:44.850
It's a very strong name.

19:45.225 --> 19:47.102
It's different every time,

19:47.186 --> 19:50.522
but the feelings are still the same.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.818
I want a better life for them.
For all of them.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.321
<i>They can have that.</i>

19:58.780 --> 20:01.450
Well, you closed down
the new casino, Wendy.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.538
I have a plan.

20:06.622 --> 20:07.873
<i>Plan. Yeah.</i>

20:07.956 --> 20:10.876
<i>Well, your plan is bleeding my money</i>
<i>every day.</i>

20:14.838 --> 20:16.340
You've trusted me so far.

20:17.549 --> 20:18.842
<i>I don't trust you.</i>

20:19.968 --> 20:21.803
I trust my opinion of you.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.515
<i>So, please, the next time we talk,</i>

20:25.599 --> 20:28.060
<i>I want to hear that you closed this deal,</i>
<i>and, Wendy...</i>

20:30.062 --> 20:32.648
<i>Well, if you can't get what you want</i>
<i>with reason, then...</i>

20:32.731 --> 20:33.732
Yes.

20:33.815 --> 20:37.152
[inhales]
...you'll have to get it with force.

20:37.778 --> 20:38.695
[beeps]

20:38.779 --> 20:40.364
[call disconnects]

20:56.463 --> 20:58.882
There's half a million dollars
in the bag on the floor.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.804
It's yours if you leave town immediately.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.857
[unzips]

21:22.698 --> 21:25.200
All you people ever understand is money.

21:27.077 --> 21:28.287
Is that a yes?

21:31.206 --> 21:32.165
Come with me.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.130
No.

21:40.382 --> 21:41.300
Please.

21:47.180 --> 21:48.265
I can't.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.241
[whimpers] I can't. [panting]

22:15.208 --> 22:16.543
[Marty sighs]

22:20.339 --> 22:22.799
[Helen] <i>You don't ask this man</i>
<i>the same question twice.</i>

22:23.508 --> 22:25.761
Well, Helen, I'm not asking a question.
I'm telling you,

22:25.844 --> 22:27.846
as the person who directs these finances,

22:27.929 --> 22:30.724
we need to look for a short-term solution
for our laundering problems.

22:30.807 --> 22:34.895
And I am telling you, as his attorney,
my client wants his new business clean.

22:34.978 --> 22:36.688
You're gonna have to find another way.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.858
Tell me, is it your client's wish,
or is it Wendy's?

22:41.568 --> 22:42.527
Why would you ask that?

22:42.944 --> 22:46.782
Well, because I don't think you understand
how invested she is with your client.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.241
Meaning what, precisely?

22:56.333 --> 22:59.002
The only reason we can't move money
through the Missouri Belle now

22:59.086 --> 23:01.797
is because of an audit
that she brought down on us. Okay?

23:02.255 --> 23:04.174
-Maybe she should talk to Navarro.
-No.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.760
Her obsession with expansion,
it's fucked us.

23:06.843 --> 23:09.304
No, no, no, no. You fucked us, Marty.

23:09.930 --> 23:12.516
I've seen the warrant.
Wendy didn't cause this audit.

23:12.599 --> 23:14.851
You did, when you decided
to blow up a casino.

23:15.310 --> 23:17.187
Let's be plain. You played, you lost.

23:17.270 --> 23:19.523
I have no interest
in looking at that any further.

23:19.606 --> 23:21.525
My interest is in moving forward
as a team.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.902
Now, I assume
that's not gonna be a problem.

23:27.322 --> 23:29.116
-Is that gonna be a problem?
-No.

23:32.452 --> 23:34.538
You need to leave
before my daughter gets home.

23:42.212 --> 23:43.839
[footsteps approaching]

23:44.923 --> 23:46.133
[Carl] Mrs. Byrde.

23:48.718 --> 23:49.803
Mrs. Byrde.

23:49.970 --> 23:50.887
Oh.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.098
[laughing] I'm sorry.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.852
I was-- I was really lost there.
[chuckles]

23:57.269 --> 23:59.563
I quite often find myself as such.

24:02.482 --> 24:03.525
[Carl sighs]

24:06.945 --> 24:09.906
Thank you for coming out to see me.
I know our...

24:11.533 --> 24:13.493
our dealings have not been friendly.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.620
That's a way of putting it.

24:16.746 --> 24:18.915
But I have no desire to bankrupt you.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.334
How Christian.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.253
-Coffee, hon?
-Yes, please.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.428
-That's good. Thank you very much.
-Mm-hmm, sure. Oh, sure thing.

24:38.518 --> 24:40.061
What do you really want here?

24:42.772 --> 24:44.691
Some dignity would be nice.

24:46.651 --> 24:47.819
That's understandable.

24:48.904 --> 24:51.448
Because from what I see,
you don't get that at home.

24:55.952 --> 24:57.579
How long have you been married?

24:57.662 --> 24:59.873
[clears throat] Forty-four years.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.713
And for how many of those 44 years

25:06.796 --> 25:09.007
has she made you feel insignificant?

25:10.926 --> 25:12.260
[stammers] Now, look, I--

25:12.886 --> 25:14.221
I used to stay at home.

25:14.429 --> 25:15.347
I did.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.641
I raised the kids. I...

25:17.933 --> 25:21.311
I did the grocery shopping
and the driving and the cleaning,

25:21.394 --> 25:23.021
and it's a noble thing.

25:23.146 --> 25:24.856
It is, but it's...

25:26.024 --> 25:27.400
It's not what I wanted.

25:29.027 --> 25:29.986
So...

25:31.655 --> 25:32.822
I took back my life.

25:34.241 --> 25:36.409
And now I answer to only one person.

25:37.452 --> 25:38.370
Me.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.375
You sound like your husband.

25:45.919 --> 25:46.878
How's that?

25:48.046 --> 25:52.384
He told me my desires had taken
a backseat to my wife's for too long.

25:53.343 --> 25:55.470
He's the reason I pulled out of our deal.

25:58.598 --> 25:59.432
Huh.

26:00.267 --> 26:01.184
Well...

26:02.227 --> 26:04.771
My husband, he had a very good point.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.693
If you don't sell us your hotel,

26:11.444 --> 26:13.446
you're facing financial ruin.

26:13.822 --> 26:17.409
Now, you've got to get your wife
to do the right thing here.

26:17.492 --> 26:20.704
Otherwise, she's gonna lord this over you
your entire life.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.789
Is that what you want?

26:24.916 --> 26:26.293
-No.
-No.

26:27.794 --> 26:31.006
And even if this is all her fault,
do you think she'll ever see it that way?

26:33.633 --> 26:35.051
-No.
-No.

26:35.510 --> 26:37.804
So don't-- don't let that happen.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.857
I don't think I can win
this particular battle.

26:52.527 --> 26:56.281
For the rest of your life, Carl...

26:57.657 --> 27:00.619
every single day

27:00.994 --> 27:03.121
being told you're a failure?

27:04.873 --> 27:07.417
Now, you're a smart man.

27:08.043 --> 27:10.462
She might not be able to see that,
but I can.

27:11.755 --> 27:14.007
And if you can't get what you want
with reason,

27:14.090 --> 27:15.300
get it with force.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.894
[door closes]

27:36.029 --> 27:37.614
Talk to Wyatt lately?

27:38.448 --> 27:40.825
[sighs] I'm not doing this, Ruth.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.786
It's a simple fucking question.

27:43.703 --> 27:45.497
[clears throat] Yes.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.874
Are you gonna fucking tell me
how he's doing?

27:49.542 --> 27:52.128
You going to tell me what's going on
between you guys?

27:55.048 --> 27:57.008
Then I ain't telling you
how he's fucking doing.

27:58.301 --> 28:00.095
[vehicle approaching]

28:01.429 --> 28:02.514
[Ruth] Shit.

28:13.733 --> 28:15.485
What the fuck are you doing here?

28:16.152 --> 28:18.321
Always authentic. Hi.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.034
You okay?

28:23.702 --> 28:24.536
Yeah.

28:30.458 --> 28:33.336
I've been meaning to offer my condolences
about your father.

28:33.420 --> 28:34.879
Yeah? Is that right?

28:35.755 --> 28:37.757
I lost my dad when I was about your age.

28:39.467 --> 28:40.760
Was he murdered?

28:42.303 --> 28:43.888
-No.
-Hmm.

28:46.224 --> 28:48.017
What did your daddy do for a living?

28:48.560 --> 28:49.686
He was a surgeon.

28:51.229 --> 28:52.188
[scoffs]

28:53.398 --> 28:54.524
No, he wasn't.

28:56.651 --> 28:57.986
He fixed refrigerators.

28:58.653 --> 29:00.363
Died of a heart attack at 61.

29:00.447 --> 29:02.657
My mother, she was a teacher,

29:02.741 --> 29:05.326
and she is still alive
because she is too mean to die.

29:05.410 --> 29:06.536
What about your mom?

29:06.619 --> 29:07.787
She's dead.

29:07.871 --> 29:10.540
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that.

29:10.623 --> 29:12.083
Yeah, it was a long time ago.

29:12.709 --> 29:14.169
We done enough chitchat now?

29:18.298 --> 29:20.759
Your contributions to the company
have been exceptional lately,

29:20.842 --> 29:22.302
and I wanted you to know that.

29:23.720 --> 29:24.763
Okay.

29:25.138 --> 29:26.514
Your slot machine idea,

29:27.098 --> 29:28.767
that really saved this last deal.

29:30.643 --> 29:31.519
All right.

29:31.644 --> 29:35.356
I'm impressed with your skills,
and I'm impressed with your loyalty.

29:36.065 --> 29:39.861
Now, because of this new casino,
Marty may have increased responsibilities.

29:41.446 --> 29:42.447
Like what?

29:43.072 --> 29:45.909
We want him to set up the books,
we'll need him on security.

29:45.992 --> 29:47.535
Startup concerns, generally.

29:49.037 --> 29:49.913
Okay.

29:50.955 --> 29:54.501
Could you run the day-to-day
at the Missouri Belle if Marty were away?

29:57.212 --> 29:58.546
Yeah, I could do that.

29:59.672 --> 30:01.174
That's what I was hoping.

30:04.552 --> 30:05.720
Have a lovely day.

30:13.102 --> 30:15.104
[engine starts]

30:18.149 --> 30:20.151
[vehicle pulls away]

30:30.787 --> 30:33.289
[shouting]

30:33.373 --> 30:34.541
[laughs]

30:34.624 --> 30:37.168
-[Jonah] Whoo!
-Whoo-hoo!

30:41.422 --> 30:42.674
[continues shouting]

30:42.757 --> 30:43.758
[horn honks]

30:43.842 --> 30:47.554
-Oh, fuck.
-[siren wails]

30:47.637 --> 30:50.682
Boat cops? That's a thing?

30:53.351 --> 30:54.853
Turn your engine off.

30:55.937 --> 30:58.231
Yeah, just... just let me do the talking.

30:58.731 --> 31:00.024
You're 14.

31:06.739 --> 31:08.575
Going a little fast there,
aren't you, bud?

31:09.450 --> 31:11.536
Hey, Sheriff Nix. It's Jonah Byrde.

31:11.619 --> 31:14.789
Oh, hey, Jonah.
I didn't recognize you there.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.125
So, who's this you're here with?

31:17.834 --> 31:19.252
This is my Uncle Ben.

31:20.044 --> 31:21.880
All right. All right, Uncle Ben.

31:21.963 --> 31:24.382
You wanna just slow it down
just a little bit for me there?

31:25.008 --> 31:25.925
We will.

31:27.135 --> 31:30.763
All right.
Say hey to your mom and dad for me, okay?

31:30.847 --> 31:32.056
-[Jonah] Okay.
-All right.

31:33.558 --> 31:37.020
-[police boat starts, retreats]
-What just happened here?

31:37.520 --> 31:39.272
I should probably drive us home.

31:43.860 --> 31:44.903
[engine starts]

31:46.571 --> 31:48.281
-[sighs]
-[engine revving]

31:48.781 --> 31:51.284
-[Ruth] Marty. Hey, Marty.
-Yes.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.953
-Are you fucking deaf?
-Well, you know, I'm busy, Ruth.

31:54.370 --> 31:57.165
That why you didn't tell me
that I was gonna have to run this place

31:57.248 --> 31:59.876
-while you get Big Muddy sorted out?
-What are you talking about?

32:00.001 --> 32:02.837
Helen came over to my place
to see if I can handle shit here

32:02.921 --> 32:04.923
because they're gonna need you over there.

32:08.134 --> 32:09.385
What did you tell her?

32:09.719 --> 32:12.180
That I could do it.
The fuck you think I told her?

32:14.390 --> 32:16.559
What? What?

32:16.643 --> 32:19.979
Uh, she's just--
she's exploring her options.

32:21.147 --> 32:23.274
Exploring her options for what?

32:23.816 --> 32:27.570
In case they decide to go
an unexpected way with me.

32:28.446 --> 32:29.364
It's okay.

32:32.325 --> 32:35.745
What-- What? How the fuck is it okay?

32:36.412 --> 32:37.705
You know, I should have known

32:37.789 --> 32:39.874
that giant fucking bitch
was up to something.

32:45.254 --> 32:46.589
What are we gonna do?

32:47.340 --> 32:49.634
I just gotta figure out a way
to keep on laundering.

32:50.593 --> 32:51.511
[beeps]

32:54.931 --> 32:58.309
[Carl] They will bankrupt us and for what?

32:58.851 --> 33:03.022
So we can be living out on the street,
but say that we won?

33:03.272 --> 33:06.359
[Anita] I don't understand
why you're not on my side on this.

33:06.442 --> 33:07.860
We gotta be reasonable here.

33:07.944 --> 33:10.989
These people have enough money
to ruin us five times over.

33:11.072 --> 33:12.991
What do you know about business?

33:13.616 --> 33:15.201
I'm putting my foot down.

33:18.246 --> 33:21.082
Oh. So, to me, you'll put your foot down.

33:21.791 --> 33:23.543
To me, you'll be the big burly man,

33:23.626 --> 33:27.296
but those two blonde b-words,
you barely have a thing to say.

33:31.134 --> 33:32.093
That's not fair.

33:32.719 --> 33:34.262
Don't talk to me about fair.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.557
[laughs] Is it fair I married the man

33:37.640 --> 33:40.476
with the worst business sense
in the state of Missouri?

33:41.936 --> 33:45.148
Everything everybody said about you
is right.

33:45.231 --> 33:48.359
You ran this place straight
into the ground.

33:48.693 --> 33:50.028
And you wanna know what else?

33:50.611 --> 33:52.196
I should have married your brother.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.449
-He was three inches taller than--
-Enough!

33:54.532 --> 33:55.992
[Anita shouts, body thuds]

34:33.613 --> 34:36.032
-[cell phone beeps]
-[line ringing]

34:39.035 --> 34:40.703
-[Marty] <i>Hello.</i>
-We got the hotel.

34:44.457 --> 34:46.417
Uh, that was fast.

34:47.126 --> 34:48.753
<i>They had a change of heart.</i>

34:50.922 --> 34:53.007
Okay. Uh, good. Um...

34:54.550 --> 34:57.887
Are you calling to offer me
some assistance here, Wendy?

34:59.555 --> 35:01.099
I'm just trying to keep you updated.

35:01.641 --> 35:03.851
<i>Got it. Okay, well, I'm updated,</i>

35:03.935 --> 35:05.645
and I'll talk to you later.

35:07.438 --> 35:08.397
[beeps]

35:19.534 --> 35:20.451
Hey, Mom.

35:23.621 --> 35:25.623
-Jonah.
-Yeah.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.669
I'm gonna get Zeke back from Mrs. Snell.

35:29.752 --> 35:31.170
[water runs]

35:32.046 --> 35:33.714
Are you sure that's a good idea?

35:35.341 --> 35:36.300
I am.

35:39.345 --> 35:40.263
Cool.

35:43.015 --> 35:44.684
Who's Zeke? A dog?

35:47.478 --> 35:48.521
[laughs] No.

35:51.482 --> 35:52.358
A baby.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.193
-Your baby?
-No.

35:55.862 --> 35:56.779
Huh!

35:57.947 --> 35:59.490
Gotta say...

36:01.242 --> 36:04.620
it's a complicated world
you got going down here, Wen.

36:04.704 --> 36:07.665
[inhales, sighs heavily]

36:08.207 --> 36:09.500
Casinos...

36:09.917 --> 36:10.918
babies.

36:11.294 --> 36:14.839
Your kid just talked his way
out of a speeding ticket on the lake.

36:15.464 --> 36:17.049
[stammers] Jonah was speeding?

36:17.133 --> 36:18.342
I was speeding.

36:20.344 --> 36:23.472
Oh, come on. He loved it.

36:23.764 --> 36:26.726
-He is by far my favorite.
-[laughs]

36:27.351 --> 36:29.478
He's a little boy version of you.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.941
God, no one has ever said that.

36:35.276 --> 36:36.152
So...

36:37.945 --> 36:38.779
[Wendy chuckles]

36:39.155 --> 36:40.406
...let me recount.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.533
-You had a baby.
-I didn't have a baby.

36:42.617 --> 36:44.619
You had a baby, moved to Missouri.

36:44.744 --> 36:46.245
You bought a casino...

36:46.746 --> 36:49.373
and apparently, the Ozark Boat Police,

36:49.457 --> 36:52.627
and then you bought another casino, and...

36:53.294 --> 36:56.672
you and Marty are doing really great.

37:03.554 --> 37:05.014
I didn't have a baby.

37:08.809 --> 37:10.686
Some bad money things...

37:11.562 --> 37:13.356
happened in Chicago, and...

37:15.024 --> 37:18.110
regardless of the--
of the money things, um...

37:20.321 --> 37:21.322
I had an affair.

37:23.282 --> 37:24.492
Everybody knows.

37:25.034 --> 37:26.244
Marty knows.

37:27.745 --> 37:29.080
[voice breaks] The kids...

37:30.122 --> 37:31.415
The kids know.

37:33.751 --> 37:37.255
And we moved here to start over.

37:38.172 --> 37:39.632
And it's been hard.

37:41.842 --> 37:44.804
We were fostering a baby for a while,
but whatever, it's, um...

37:51.519 --> 37:52.812
How was the affair?

37:53.437 --> 37:54.689
Fucking sucked.

37:57.733 --> 37:59.777
The end of it really fucking sucked.

38:02.530 --> 38:03.614
[Ben] Hmm.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.702
[sighs]

38:10.288 --> 38:11.580
Marty wants me to leave.

38:11.664 --> 38:13.374
Oh, he doesn't want you to leave.

38:13.874 --> 38:15.584
He told me to leave.

38:16.252 --> 38:18.629
Okay, well, yeah, he wants you to leave.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.594
-Who was the affair with?
-Just some guy.

38:47.825 --> 38:50.244
Aah! [sighs]

38:52.038 --> 38:54.290
-[laughing]
-So...

38:54.373 --> 38:55.708
[Ben laughs]

38:56.292 --> 38:58.294
[laughter continues]

38:59.587 --> 39:00.463
[pops]

39:02.631 --> 39:04.383
How are you gonna get this baby?

39:07.845 --> 39:10.264
I'm gonna pick a fistfight
with a hillbilly.

39:11.390 --> 39:12.767
-You're serious?
-Mm-hmm.

39:13.100 --> 39:14.602
What's Marty think about that?

39:15.394 --> 39:18.981
-I don't give a fuck what Marty thinks.
-Ooh.

39:19.565 --> 39:22.151
Look at you, Wendy Davis.

39:23.110 --> 39:24.403
Yes!

39:24.487 --> 39:26.489
[laughing]

39:30.368 --> 39:33.496
What I'm proposing is that
we lease you guys your equipment.

39:33.579 --> 39:37.166
I could make things smoother for you.
We could funnel everything through.

39:37.249 --> 39:41.003
One lender could pump some money back
into this local economy.

39:41.087 --> 39:42.671
Yeah, I don't know, man.

39:43.172 --> 39:46.133
Bands get nervous when you start
subbing out sound equipment, all right?

39:46.217 --> 39:47.468
-Do they? Um...
-Yeah.

39:48.344 --> 39:50.096
Well, um...

39:52.139 --> 39:53.933
Dickey, uh, would...

39:54.725 --> 39:57.937
would it mitigate any of those nerves
if-if we, uh...

39:59.647 --> 40:01.399
if we did an extra 100 grand?

40:03.150 --> 40:04.777
Will that make things better?

40:05.027 --> 40:07.154
Huh. That's, uh...

40:08.489 --> 40:09.573
That's reasonable.

40:09.990 --> 40:11.200
I would say so.

40:13.035 --> 40:15.413
-I'm gonna have to call the boys.
-Sure, of course.

40:15.496 --> 40:17.373
-Okay. Give me a minute here.
-Please do.

40:17.456 --> 40:19.166
And, um-- And if it's helpful, you know,

40:19.250 --> 40:21.961
same vendor could handle the merchandise
for you guys.

40:22.044 --> 40:25.131
If it's helpful. I just need
your signature on a few invoices

40:25.214 --> 40:27.049
-and a couple receipts.
-Hey, Kev. Yeah.

40:27.133 --> 40:29.552
Hey, um, so listen,

40:29.635 --> 40:31.846
the guy here wants us
to help him launder some money.

40:32.888 --> 40:34.390
[laughs] Yeah, man. An extra 100K.

40:35.599 --> 40:38.227
[laughing]

40:38.602 --> 40:39.979
Oh, look at you.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.524
Oh, your sock is almost off.

40:44.275 --> 40:47.236
You're silly. You're silly.

40:54.577 --> 40:56.370
Desperate for honey, Mrs. Byrde?

40:56.954 --> 40:58.205
I've got a proposition.

40:59.290 --> 41:00.583
Oh, hi, Mrs. Byrde.

41:02.835 --> 41:04.170
Hey, Wyatt.

41:05.045 --> 41:07.882
-I didn't realize you were working here.
-[Darlene] How can we help you?

41:09.133 --> 41:10.509
We've bought a new casino,

41:10.593 --> 41:13.888
and we're ready to cut you in,
in a very generous way.

41:13.971 --> 41:16.515
All you have to do is give up
your parental rights.

41:18.350 --> 41:19.852
What are you saying to me?

41:20.269 --> 41:22.605
I'm offering you money for Zeke.

41:22.688 --> 41:25.900
Hey, uh, I really don't think this is
the right place to be talking about this.

41:25.983 --> 41:29.069
Well, no,
he should have a nice young family.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.447
I mean, don't you agree, Wyatt?
Not an aging widow.

41:31.530 --> 41:34.533
-I think she's trying to upset you.
-Jacob would take the deal.

41:34.617 --> 41:37.161
I don't ever wanna hear you
utter his name again.

41:37.244 --> 41:38.621
We should all just calm down.

41:38.704 --> 41:41.248
I think we can all agree
that the child deserves better

41:41.332 --> 41:43.667
than a farm stand
and a redneck for a mama.

41:43.751 --> 41:44.668
[grunts]

41:50.090 --> 41:51.091
That ought to do it.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.930
-[Darlene] Get out of here!
-[Wyatt] Stop.

41:56.013 --> 41:58.516
-Get out of here before I kill you!
-Stop, Darlene.

41:59.725 --> 42:02.394
-She is gonna try and take my baby.
-She's not gonna take your--

42:02.478 --> 42:04.897
Listen, Darlene, she's not gonna
take your baby, I promise.

42:04.980 --> 42:05.940
I can't lose him.

42:06.857 --> 42:09.109
-I can't lose him.
-It's gonna be okay.

42:10.444 --> 42:12.530
-[Wyatt] Hey, buddy.
-[baby fussing]

42:12.613 --> 42:14.782
-I'm gonna kill her.
-No, you're not.

42:14.865 --> 42:16.617
We're gonna go home right now
so you can rest,

42:16.700 --> 42:18.494
and I'm gonna take care of Zeke, okay?

42:18.577 --> 42:19.578
-Okay?
-Yeah.

42:25.209 --> 42:26.710
[camera shutter clicking]

42:41.850 --> 42:43.811
Can I ask you a personal question?

42:45.437 --> 42:47.940
When did you start a 529 for your kids?

42:50.442 --> 42:52.027
When they started preschool.

42:54.363 --> 42:55.406
Okay, good.

42:56.323 --> 42:57.366
Thank you.

43:00.869 --> 43:05.708
I know Agent Evans has pressured you
to testify against the Navarro cartel.

43:07.835 --> 43:10.713
I get it. Textbook play.

43:10.796 --> 43:11.964
It's personal for him,

43:12.047 --> 43:14.800
just like everything was personal
for Agent Petty.

43:16.385 --> 43:17.344
But...

43:19.346 --> 43:21.890
there's a world
in which you don't testify...

43:23.350 --> 43:25.769
and you don't have to go
into witness protection.

43:28.355 --> 43:31.317
There's no one on my team
who can do what you do.

43:32.234 --> 43:34.320
You on the other side... [laughs]

43:36.238 --> 43:38.490
You offering me a job in the FBI?

43:39.199 --> 43:42.036
I'm saying if you pled guilty
to a separate offense...

43:43.495 --> 43:46.165
