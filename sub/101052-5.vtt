Right.

14:42.089 --> 14:44.675
(chuckles): Who needs
to know where water is?

14:46.343 --> 14:48.053
Okay.

14:49.054 --> 14:51.181
Okay, then there's, um, flying,

14:51.265 --> 14:54.935
moving stuff, knowing stuff,
seeing the future,

14:55.019 --> 14:56.937
planting thoughts
into people's heads,

14:57.021 --> 14:59.481
and, finally, um,
controlling fire with your mind.

14:59.565 --> 15:00.816
That's a power?

15:00.899 --> 15:02.860
I mean, it's been reported.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.863
That would be cool.

15:07.239 --> 15:10.284
Why do you care
about all this shit?

15:11.285 --> 15:13.120
I don't know.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.581
Don't you want to be normal?

15:16.915 --> 15:18.792
Or cool?

15:18.876 --> 15:20.210
Yeah. I... I mean,

15:20.294 --> 15:22.796
I-I didn't even want to do
this project, you know?

15:22.880 --> 15:25.132
But, like, Ms. Watson made me.

15:25.215 --> 15:30.554
Like, I wanted to do something
about, like, marijuana...

15:30.638 --> 15:33.140
or getting high,
like, how cool that is.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.808
(laughs):
Okay.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.727
So what do we do here?

15:36.810 --> 15:38.312
Test you here.

15:38.395 --> 15:41.649
Uh, see what kinds of powers
you have, and then maybe

15:41.732 --> 15:43.859
we can figure out
how to use them for stuff.

15:45.986 --> 15:47.988
So, uh, what do you see?

15:48.072 --> 15:49.823
Circle.

15:51.408 --> 15:54.244
Yes. Wow.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.163
Wow. Okay. Cool.

15:56.246 --> 15:57.873
Yeah. Wow.

15:57.956 --> 16:00.042
Why don't I know
how I'm doing it?

16:00.125 --> 16:02.044
Have I always been doing it?

16:02.127 --> 16:06.006
Well, um, you don't
really know how you see,

16:06.090 --> 16:07.257
you just... have it.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.218
So it would follow
that a sixth sense

16:09.301 --> 16:10.761
would be the same way.

16:10.844 --> 16:13.013
Like, you can't feel it,
you-you just have it.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.682
Mm-- Right. But, like...

16:14.765 --> 16:16.850
I've never been able to see
what's on a card,

16:16.934 --> 16:19.019
and now it's like it's nothing.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.897
Yeah. Every time you do it,
you get better at it.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.357
Like anything.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.735
Okay, let's try this.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.871
Hey, what are you doing?

16:37.955 --> 16:40.666
Well, I want to see
if you can read minds

16:40.749 --> 16:42.626
since you have
astral projection.

16:42.710 --> 16:46.088
So... now the card
doesn't exist anymore,

16:46.171 --> 16:48.882
so you can't, like,
look at it in space with, like,

16:48.966 --> 16:52.594
psychic eyes--
you can only read my mind.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.722
So, what do you see?

17:01.854 --> 17:04.189
Look at me.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.615
-Star.
-Yes.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.951
(chuckles)

17:16.034 --> 17:17.953
Do another.

Yeah. I-I just tried something

It's great. I-It's almost there.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.736
You used too much foundation.

It makes you look old. Here.

Don't worry,
we'll try again tomorrow.

21:06.556 --> 21:09.476
So, how did you find out
about the bathroom?

21:09.559 --> 21:12.980
Like, did you see it,
like, in a vision?

21:13.063 --> 21:16.525
N-Nah. We used to hang out on
the roof, like, on the balcony.

21:16.608 --> 21:20.487
But they changed the locks,
and now no one can get up there.

21:20.570 --> 21:22.572
We used to get high as fuck
up there,

21:22.656 --> 21:24.491
and the teachers
never caught us.

21:24.574 --> 21:26.868
Anyway, Gwen's older sister
told us about the bathroom

21:26.952 --> 21:29.329
'cause that's where she and
her friends used to hang out.

21:29.413 --> 21:32.249
But Lisa's claustrophobic,
so we don't use it.

Oh.

-The roof sounds really cool.
-Sha.

21:35.961 --> 21:36.920
-Ladies.

Stop right there.

It is 1:00 in the morning.

What are you two doing
in the hallway?

21:42.342 --> 21:44.553
Nothing.
We-we weren't doing anything.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.346
Now you're lying.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.348
You're looking
at a serious demerit.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.559
It's unacceptable.

21:50.642 --> 21:53.186
No.

21:53.270 --> 21:54.354
Excuse me?

21:54.438 --> 21:57.232
I said no.

21:57.315 --> 21:59.401
You're gonna let us
go back to our rooms,

21:59.484 --> 22:01.361

you've been raiding

on the weekends.

would love to hear

22:05.991 --> 22:10.954
about you spending school
slush funds at the casino.

Give us the key to the balcony
as collateral.

22:24.176 --> 22:28.180
We'll never tell anyone about
your little gambling problem.

You two head back to your rooms
this instant.

22:40.358 --> 22:43.320

That was pretty baller.

22:43.403 --> 22:45.072
I mean, it was worth a shot.

22:45.155 --> 22:46.615
Fuck, that would have been
awesome.

23:46.258 --> 23:49.678
maybe it only exists
until it's served its purpose?

23:49.761 --> 23:53.598
So I have to conjure a new key
every time?

I guess blowing a 30-year-old
