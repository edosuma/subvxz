00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
I'll get us somewhere better soon.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
I know it's a bit skanky.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
I quite like the idea
of living in a caravan.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
It's romantic.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
It's mine. Might as well use it.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Should check the rest of the house.
Ready? Yeah.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Stay in your room!
Stay in your room!

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Dad... Dad! Hey, leave her alone!
No! No!

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Get off me! You're hurting me!
Leave us alone!

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
I'm calling the police -
breaking and entering,

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
theft, abduction.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
You can't stop us.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
I'll get you sent away.
Three years. Four.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
You think a girl like Sophie's going
to wait for someone like you?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Of course she will.
She loves me.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Get off me!

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
She's a child! Leave me alone!

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Get off!

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Right. One minute
till I call the police

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
and then I'll call the ambulance.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
They'll scrape up what's left!

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Dad, leave him alone!

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Leave him alone!

Damn!

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Hello?

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
Clint. What is it?
What's happened?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Where?

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Gora Point?
OK, I'll see you there.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Perfect(!)

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Beth? Beth? Clint's called.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Beth, I've got...

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Mum?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Won't be a minute. Mum?
Where are you?

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
I couldn't sleep. Fancied a walk.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
I'll be back in a bit.
THEY CHANT "DRINK, DRINK!"

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Home. Now.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Lighten up! I haven't done anything.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
I'll be back later.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
That wasn't a request.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
All right! God,
it's not like anyone died!

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
Actually, they did.
He was the same age as you.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Go home. What? Who's died?

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
I'm so busted. I don't know how she
does it every time.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
It's like she's psychic.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Who's died?

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
What? Oh, she didn't say. Some boy.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Never have kids.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Calamity!

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
Sorry. Right, we're just waiting on
your say-so to move this body.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
Steve Kernan, 16 years old -
he's a local lad.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I knew him, actually.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Dog walker found him an hour ago.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
You can move him now.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Sorry, I... Clint!

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
I'm more...living focused, you know,
like friends and relatives.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Eurgh!

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
It's like having
a massive whitey.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
My boy! Oh, my God...

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Mrs Kernan...
I'm sorry, Steve. I'm so sorry...

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Come with me. We'll let you
see him as soon as you can.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
May Kernan, Steve's mum.
The dog walker called her.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
They work together, apparently.
Listen, you don't have to be here...

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
I want to be. See it first hand.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Do we know what happened?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Well, it looks like
he killed himself.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Texted his mum last night at eight.
"Sorry, can't take any more.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
"Goodbye."
Jumped at two minutes past four.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
That's a bit specific.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
His watch broke when he landed.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Right...

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Where are you going?

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
To the top. Thought you
wanted to see it first hand?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Oh...

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
SHE GASPS FOR BREATH

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
You took your time.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Ohhh...

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Just look at that!

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
Beautiful, innit?
Mm, yeah. Gorgeous(!)

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
Funny thing is we didn't
find his mobile phone on him.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
Oh! Hey, hey, all right?

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Yeah. Just lost my footing.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
What is that?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
You've got a visitor.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
I've got court.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
She wouldn't give her name...so...

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Five minutes. You put the kettle on.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Thank you.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Please, come in.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Hi. Jane Kennedy.
Please take a seat.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
How can I help?

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
I don't know who to talk to, I...

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
It's all right, take your time.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
The boy. Last night...
The boy who...

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Steven Kernan?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
The paper said he killed himself.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Please...

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
..you have to find out what
happened to him...and who...

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Who what?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Have you talked to the police?

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
No, no, I can't.
I want to talk to you.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
You're the coroner.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
He didn't kill himself.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
You have to help him.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Of course I will.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Sorry, I didn't ask your name.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
First name's fine.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Get off!
You don't have to drag me here.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Really sorry.
I'll just be one minute. Hang on.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I can't do this. I'm sorry. I...

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Look at the state of her!

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Two more teas?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
She's had enough to drink already.
Haven't touched a drop.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Well, I'll get a breathalyser
off Davey and you can prove it.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
No need, I can smell the cider
from here. What's the big deal?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
You're 15! You sneaked out
all night. You lied about it.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
It's 11.30 in the morning
and you're drunk!

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
You said you wanted me
to make more friends.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
I was with Stace.
It was a beach party.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
I couldn't let her go on her own.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
You're grounded. What?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
But I said where I was.
I didn't do anything.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
What, apart from lying and drinking?
Good for you(!)

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
You're going into work
with your gran.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
I've got 20 barrels arriving,
Mick's at the dogs.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
You're on toilets.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
She's a baby.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
She wouldn't even get on a bus
without me two years ago.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Do you want me to talk to her?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Give her a bit of a warning?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
I think getting the police
involved's a bit heavy-handed.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Come on, I'm a friend of the family.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
I care about you.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
All of you. And I can...

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
You know, you could just tell
Annette you don't like this.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
And hurt her feelings? No wonder
all your relationships ended.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Thought you wanted to give me
the PM results?

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
Oh, yeah, well,
we got the initial results.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Steve's stomach stank of booze,
but there was none at the scene.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Time of death between two
and four-thirty

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
so that fits with the watch.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
What do you know about him?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
He was trouble.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Picked him up since he was 12 -
shoplifting, fighting,

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
burglary, you name it.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Nearly got sent away twice.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Do you think it was suicide?

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
Well, he's not going to jump from
the top of a tower for fun, is he?

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
You saw the text to his mum.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
And if he was going there to
mess about, he'd have booze on him.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
That girl didn't think
he killed himself.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
That girl, the one who didn't
give you her name.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
She asked me to investigate.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
I am. You don't need to
get involved. I'll handle it.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Going to see his parents now.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Wouldn't want you fainting again,
not like this morning.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I didn't faint.
It was low blood sugar.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
Ah, right, well,
better have these then.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Oh!

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Never did have a head for heights,
did you?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Remember Kingsbridge,
that big wheel?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
No, no, no,
that was food poisoning.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Catch you later, Calamity.
Food poisoning - ha!

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
I just want to talk to you
about Steve.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Right. Care now, do you?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
You were always accusing him
of stuff.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
Brought him home in a cop car
enough times.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Only when he broke the law.
Not always.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
You blamed him for everything.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
May, I'm sorry about Steve, love,
really, I am,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
but you've got to let me in.
I have to talk to you.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
We'll talk to someone
who isn't prejudiced.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Like who?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Do you think he was depressed?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
He was never happy. Not here.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Too many arguments.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I should've been there for him...

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Can't blame yourself, May.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
All families argue.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Steve'd argue with a postbox,
stubborn bugger.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
He was out of control.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
We tried our best, but...

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
You can't watch your kid 24/7.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Did he have a girlfriend?

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Steve always kept
himself to himself.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Hadn't seen him in days, had we?

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Got in late, left early.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
Reckon most nights,
he never even came back.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
We'll find out what happened
to Steve, I promise.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
Do you mind if I see his room,
look through his things?

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
I'll take you up.
You won't find much.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
The bins want emptying.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Hi!

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I'm hanging. Mum went mental.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
Gran's got me on bog duty.
They're disgusting.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Carry on after I left?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
What is it?

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
That boy who died...

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
..he was my best mate.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
It was Steve.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I don't know what to do.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Checking up on me?

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
No need.
Your gran's been texting me.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Just hope you've learned from this.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Found it under Steve's mattress.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
His parents don't know her,
neither do the police.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Never seen her.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Mick might, though. Mick?

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Arson Fire came in first.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
You little beauty! Ooh!

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
Mick, do you recognise her?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Cos I know you know everyone.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Nice try. I don't see it saying
"charity shop" anywhere.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Jane's family. You can tell her.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
She's not MY family.
I've got a business to run.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
No favours. Not for no-one.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
I'll have a shandy.
And whatever they're having.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Keep the change.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
Yeah. Steve came in with her
a couple of months back.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
Posh girl. Too posh for him.
Didn't get her name.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
Not surprised he topped himself,
though, dad like that.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
Dad like what?

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
No, no, no, put your money away.
It's rumours.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Can't hang a man on rumours.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
If you can help...

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
A publican is like a priest.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
What's said in the pub
stays in the pub.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Mum, can I have a word?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I was stupid and irresponsible.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
I've been thinking about it and
I was out of order. I'm sorry.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
It won't happen again.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
I appreciate that. Thank you.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Hey. I thought I'd find you here.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
Listen, I'm sorry about Steve,
really.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
I'm just trying to piece together
what happened.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
You know, the night he died.
Did you see him?

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I was meant to. He never showed.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Hadn't seen him for a week or so.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
Do you think he could have, you
know, could have killed himself?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Possibly.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
He called that night,
upset about his girlfriend.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
I don't know why. I was worried.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
You see, Steve always was a bit mad.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Yeah, you're not wrong.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Is this her?

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
Never met her.
Don't even know her name.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
She's pretty.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Had he been to Gora Point before?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Where were you at 4am?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Four?

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
With my girlfriend.
She's just moved down from London.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I took her to a party at the beach.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
OK. And what's her name?

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
Hey, Calamity. Not the full PM.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Still waiting on the tox results.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
We found Steve's mobile phone
smashed on the rocks

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
at Gora Point where
he must have chucked it.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
Forensics have the sim card
so that's going to take a few days.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Fingerprints?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
None. Can't get them off stone.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Salad again?

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Yeah. Oh, Mick said he'd heard
rumours about the dad,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
wouldn't say what.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
John? No, he's clean.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Not so much as a parking ticket.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
It's sweet Annette makes you lunch.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Yeah, well, what can I say,
she likes to look after me.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
She sew nametags
into your trousers too?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
No, but she has been known to
iron the creases in my boxers.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Listen, where's Beth?

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
Library. I let her off the hook.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
I hate to break it to you
but Annette thinks you're fat.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
No chance. That's just muscle, that.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Yeah, if muscle hangs
over your trousers.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
Listen... So, he died on impact.
No surprises there. Jane...Jane...

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
According to his GP,
he was on antidepressants.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
You never call me Jane.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
I had a word with Steve's best mate,
Matt.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Now he hadn't seen Steve,
but Steve did call him.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
He was upset. Something to do with
that girl, that one with no name.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
So I checked Matt's alibi,
but he was with HIS girlfriend.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
The thing is...

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
..it's Beth.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
How was the library?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Quiet. Lots of books.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Come and sit down.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
All right.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
You know, our chat yesterday... Yeah?

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
It meant a lot.
Knowing I can trust you.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
That you're straight with me.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
I'd hate to be one of those families
that hide things from each other.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
All right, OK, I was with a boy.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Matt. My boyfriend.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
We didn't do anything.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
I didn't, like, have...
How did you know?

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
Davey interviewed him
about his friend, Steve.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
He said he was with you.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Beth, you're 15. Last thing
you need is a big relationship.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
You were only 15 when you
started going out with Davey.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
Yeah, exactly. Took me
three years to come to my senses.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
Gran says you used to sneak out of
the house all the time to see him.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
Right, OK,
well, things were different then.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
Like how?
Like more...more...innocent.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Mum, it was the 1990s,
not the 1890s!

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
I know what you got up to.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
And Gran was pregnant
with you at 15!

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I'm like a nun compared to you two.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
Anyway, Matt's nice.
He's really nice.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
I... What?

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
I just don't want you to get hurt.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
The only person that's
hurt right now is Matt.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
He's just lost his best mate.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Don't make him lose me, too.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
What do you reckon? Mick's taking me
out with his winnings.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
Eye-catching. Very... Very bold.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Isn't it?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Still got it.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Don't wait up.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
Apologies in advance
if we make too much noise.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Mick's a bit of a screamer.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Mum! Oh, Gran! Oh, shut up!

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
You know, sometimes I think
it would be an advantage

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
if we DID hide things as a family.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
You might be right.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Let me see him. Please, Mum.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I took the bin out this morning.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Thought that was my job.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Didn't want you to forget. Again.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
What have you done, John?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Put it away.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
Useless!
Can't even take the rubbish out!

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
One more bag, lads!

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Look, if I split them up,
it'll only make them closer.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Well, that's up to you.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
You could get him round for dinner.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
You know, invite me. I'll make sure
he knows not to mess her about.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Good idea!
You could ask him some questions

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
about Steve while he's there.
Casual, like, over dessert...

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
Absolutely not. Can we stop
discussing my daughter

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
and concentrate on the case?
You brought it up.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
Steve's doctor said Steve had
started group counselling,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
but he kept it quiet.
Didn't even tell his parents.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
I had a word with the counsellor,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
see if he had any mates there,
but he was keeping shtoom.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
Apparently, Steve quit last month.
Oh, and we got the tox results back.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
He wasn't taking his meds.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Ooh, well, there you go, then.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
If he was off his meds,
he'd be on a right downer.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
Exactly. So it looks like suicide
to me, Calamity.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
We need to find that girlfriend.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
Actually...what are you
doing tonight?

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
Maybe it was a lucky escape.
If he did that,

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
he's hardly the right person to
look after my precious daughter.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
And you do need looking after.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
No...

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
It's for the best.
And then it'll all be over.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Trust me.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Come on, Sophie.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Just take the bloody tablet!

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Take it!

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Good girl.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
Let's say you have an argument
with your girlfriend.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
You got drunk.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
You were already depressed,
now you feel terrible. Hopeless.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
So you text your mum,
saying you can't take any more.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
Then you go somewhere
out of the way.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
Somewhere no-one will find you
till it's too late.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Gora Point.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
You throw your phone over the cliff,
break in and...

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Why didn't you jump off the cliff?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Why break in?

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
Because it IS out of the way
and no-one would see you.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
You were meeting someone.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
It's fashion! It's not appropriate.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
It's fashion!
You are not wearing that.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Grrr!
DOOR SLAMS

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Sorry.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
How is it all... You know?

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
Yeah, still trying to find
Steve's girlfriend.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
Don't even know her name. Do you?

23:12.000 --> 23:17.000
Matt, do you know anyone who'd
want to hurt Steve?

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
I thought he jumped?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Well, we can't know that for sure.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
No talking about work. You promised.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
This is meant to be about us, you
know, getting to know each other.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
Stop you freaking out.
Excuse me, I don't freak out.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
Matt's going to study
marine biology.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
If I get the grades. Wow!

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
Did Beth tell you she wants to be
a forensic pathologist?

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Obsessed with death. Obsessed!

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Tries to gate-crash
all my postmortems.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Sorry, I didn't mean...
KNOCK AT DOOR

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
Sorry, I'm late. Room for one more?

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
Yes. Oh, I didn't realise
you were together.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
We're not. I'm married.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
To someone else. Not to Jane.
Obviously. Right.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
He's just a... Friend of the family.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
I'll check the lasagne.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
Right, I'll get this wine open.
Thanks!

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
Beth, I told you to turn it down!
SMOKE ALARM BEEPS

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Will you turn that thing off?
Mum, you said turn it up!

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
Down, Beth, down!
You said up. It's ruined.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
It's all right, just cut
the burnt bits off.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
I've got a chisel in the car.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Fish and chips?

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
Yes, I'll find my purse.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
Here you go, keep the change.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Oh, cheers!

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
I'm sorry.
I'm sure it would have been lovely.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Matt, you coming?

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
I don't know why he thought
we were.... I know. It's ridiculous.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
You know, I think I might go down
the Dog. OK, yeah. I'll just...

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I'll chuck this. Sorry.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
That'll be the counselling group.
You got your story?

25:01.000 --> 25:06.000
I've got 26 years of parental
conflict. I'll be fine.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
How did you get on last night?

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Fine. Good. Had a takeout.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
I think I might actually like him.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Sweet.
Right, I'll see you in an hour.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
When you said "something special",

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
I thought you meant,
like, the cinema.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Come on.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
Steve was the main topic of
conversation. Couldn't shut them up.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
They're all cut up about him

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
and surprised his girlfriend
didn't show today.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
This is where they met -
group counselling.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
I got her name.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Mick was right. She is posh.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
Wait for me, I'll be ten minutes.
And have you scare her off?

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
It's all right, I'm here now.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I'll call you back in a minute.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
We need to talk. Now.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
He was off his meds.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
His dad said he was out of control.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
I know Steve had a wild side.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
He was a bit reckless, dangerous,

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
but he was the sweetest boy
I've ever met.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Gentle and thoughtful.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
And he had a hard time at home.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
His dad beat him up.
Hit his mum too.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
Steve didn't know what to do,
how to stop it.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
He felt helpless and angry.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
So how can you be sure
it wasn't suicide?

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
Because he wasn't depressed -
he was happy.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
I'm pregnant.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
I filmed this two days
before he died.

27:06.000 --> 27:13.000
I'm your daddy, do you know that?
Can you hear me?

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
She's ten weeks old. Yeah,
and she's three centimetres long.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
With fingernails.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Do you know THAT?

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
I can feel her move!

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
You can't feel anything,
you idiot, she's too tiny.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Who you calling an idiot?

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
I love you.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
That wasn't someone who's suicidal.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
The night he died,
we were planning to leave.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
When did you last see him?

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
At a quarter to nine that evening.
My dad caught us.

27:46.000 --> 27:51.000
Went mad. He locked me in my room
and attacked Steve.

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
Steve ran off and
the next thing I know, he was dead.

27:57.000 --> 28:03.000
Sophie, do you think your dad could
have done anything to Steve?

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
My dad is capable of anything.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
You've got to investigate.
This is a murder case.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
You don't know that.
It wasn't suicide!

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
The text to his mum was about
running away, not killing himself.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
As the coroner,
I'm asking you to investigate.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I'll talk to Steve's mum.
You interview Sophie's dad.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
Hang on, hang on, shouldn't
I be the one to say what happens?

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
You always did like
bossing me around.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
You used to like it.
Never had any complaints then.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
You do know who her dad is?
He's a magistrate.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
I thought you weren't
bothered about status.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
I'm not. Couldn't care less.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
But the boss is!
I've got to run it past him.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
If we get this wrong, we might never
get a search warrant again.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
So, in other words,
he's above investigation?

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
You're just going to have to
trust me on this one, all right?

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
And, Calamity...

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
for what it's worth... Matt...

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
I like him.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
I used to go fishing with Steve.
Crabbing at Gora Bay.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
That was...our place, you know -
get away from everyone,

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
sort our heads out.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
You must miss him.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
Knew each other since we were three.
My mum hated him.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
He was always getting me
into trouble.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Always up to something.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I just feel...

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
Did I put my foot in it
with your mum and Davey last night?

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Totally. It was hilarious.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
I just thought they were together.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
They used to be. They went out
when they were our age,

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
but Mum caught him
snogging someone else.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
Yeah. She dumped him,
went to uni early.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Gran said she was devastated.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
She didn't come back here for years.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Shame. Not really.

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
If they'd stayed together,
she wouldn't have met my dad.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Ooh, I think I've got something!

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Matt, I think I've caught something.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
OK, reel it in, reel it in.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
I'm not coming in, I'm going to
the pub. I'll be back later.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
May?

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
May, can I have a word?

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
Now? I've just buried my boy.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I know. I'm so sorry.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
I just... I need to ask.

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
Is there anything you're
not telling me?

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
I can't find out what happened
if you won't talk to me.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
You think I don't want to?

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Just talk to me, May, please!

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
I have a daughter,
a year younger than Steve - Beth.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
She's 15 and the thought of...

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
..the thought of anything
happening to her, I...

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
What you're going through, May...

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
..no mother should have
to go through this.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
He came round that night...drunk.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
I wanted to talk to him, after that
text, but John got in first.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
Dragged him off.
Didn't say anything else.

31:31.000 --> 31:36.000
John drove off before midnight.
Didn't ask where.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
John don't like questions.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
I think John hurt him.
Really hurt him.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
You can't tell him
I said anything...

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
You don't have to put up with this,
May.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
There are people who can help.
Maybe.

32:06.000 --> 32:11.000
Sometimes it feels like I'm the only
person who cares he's dead.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
I was at the magistrates' dinner
in Plymouth at the Regal Hotel.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
Which finished at 12, so
where were you at four?

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
In bed.

32:25.000 --> 32:30.000
I had a few drinks after
the dinner, a few too many.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
My driver had to take me in.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
That's no alibi.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
How do you do that?

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
Fell over outside when I was...
when I was drunk.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
I have it on good authority
that you attacked Steve Kernan.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
Because he was
kidnapping my daughter!

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
She's 16, she can leave home
without your consent.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
I know the law! She's a YOUNG 16.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
A child!

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
I'm not denying I hit him,
but I DID NOT kill him.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
Then why does this good authority
suggest you're capable of murder?

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
What?!

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
The baby...

33:13.000 --> 33:19.000
..I gave her a pill
to get rid of it.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
But that's not murder.
It was kindness.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
It would have ruined her life.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
That's not your decision
to make, though, is it?

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
The hotel staff and driver
backed up his story.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
He was so drunk
he couldn't climb his own stairs,

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
let alone Gora Point.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
I'll have to go and see John.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
What?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Nothing. No, it's nothing.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
I know you. What is it?

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
Why wasn't Matt at Steve's funeral?

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
I don't know.
Probably couldn't handle it.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
You know what teenagers are like.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
Bury their heads in the sand,
pretend it hasn't happened.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Don't worry though, he's got
an alibi. He was with Beth.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
Right, I'll let you know
how I get on with John.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Be careful.
Don't make things worse for May.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
She's terrified of him.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
I can do subtle.
I'll make out it's routine.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Look what I caught!

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Can have them for tea.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
Yeah, I'm sure your gran can
do something with those.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Beth,
can I have a quick word with Matt?

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Yeah, sure.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
Is it about Beth?

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
No, it's about Steve.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
You told Davey you'd spoken to him.
When was that?

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
About ten to nine.
He was upset about his girlfriend.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Said he'd fill me in later.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
But you didn't talk to him again?

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
No. We were meant to meet,
but he never showed.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
So I just went to the party.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
Did you know he was leaving
with her that night?

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
What?

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
She's pregnant. Sophie.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Steve was going to be a dad.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
What? I didn't...

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
A dad?

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Why didn't you go to his funeral?

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I couldn't.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
I couldn't face it.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
DOOR OPENS

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
Next door saw you
talking to her.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
What did you say?

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Nothing. Eh? I said nothing, John.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
KNOCK AT DOOR
Please John. Let me go.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
Hello? Anyone in?

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
Hello, my love, I just wondered
if I could have a quick word.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Right, thanks.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Look, I'm sorry to bother you,

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
it's just we're changing
the line of inquiry,

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
opening up the investigation.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Meaning?

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Meaning we're not
ruling anything out.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
You don't think Steve
killed himself?

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
Well, possibly. Just a couple
of routine questions, really.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Where were you both
the night he died?

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
Why? Simple enough question.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Why do you need to know for?
Where were you?

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
I'm not answering nothing.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Why not?
Cos it's none of your business!

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Listen, where were you
the night your son died?

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
You want to ask me again, do you?

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
John Kernan,
I'm arresting you on suspicion

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
of the murder of Steven Kernan...

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Sophie!

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
This is my aunt. Hello!
I'm going to be staying at hers.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
This is her number.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
You OK?

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
I gave Steve a present.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
He had it with him when...

36:36.000 --> 36:40.000
I was wondering if I could
have it back, if that's OK?

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
I didn't know who to ask.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
What was it?

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
It was just an old watch.
He liked it.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
He thought it was retro.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
It's got broken, I'm so sorry,
it got smashed.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
It never worked anyway.
It's sentimental.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
It was my grandad's.
It didn't work?

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
The hands were stuck. At least
it worked twice a day.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
That's what Steve said.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Two minutes past four...

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
Fancy going to the Black Dog?
I'm meeting Mum.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
Can cadge some chips off Gran.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
I'm not great company right now.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Is it Steve?

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
I was a crap mate.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
What? Course you weren't.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Want to bet?

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Look, I need to be
on my own for a bit.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Sort my head out.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
You seen Beth?
She's not answering her phone.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Nope.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Hi, Mum. Hey.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
You OK? Yeah. Oh, I meant to ask,

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
what time did Matt arrive
at the beach party?

37:55.000 --> 37:59.000
Stacey said he arrived just
after her. Half three?

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
How did he seem to you?

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
Pretty quiet. Really wasted.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
But he's not normally like that.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
He hardly drinks. Why?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Has he said anything to you
about Steve?

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Just that he misses him.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
Mainly he just changes the
conversation. I was just with him.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
He was...weird.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Said he was a crap mate.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
You think he was involved?

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
Are you going to be like this
with all of my boyfriends?

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Beth, I'm not saying he's involved...

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
We've interviewed John.
He was with his fancy woman

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
so he didn't want to say
anything in front of May.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
We've got him in custody, actually.
Assaulting a police officer.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Subtle approach worked, then? Yeah.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
We got the time of death wrong.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Steve's watch was already broken.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
He could've died earlier.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
We need to find Matt.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
He's got a hole in his alibi.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
Where is he, Beth?
He hasn't done anything!

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
No-one's saying he has.
We just want to talk to him. Well?

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
I don't know.
Said he wanted to be alone.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Sort his head out.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
He was heading towards Gora Bay.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
No, left, left. There it is.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Yeah, hello?

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Yeah.

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
I need backup at Gora Point Lookout,
quick as you can.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
No, no, no, in the car. We agreed!

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
He's my boyfriend! No arguing!

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
Matt!

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
What are you playing at?
Come back down.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Just keep away!

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Matt, come on. Come down.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
Beth, do you ever listen?

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
I'm sorry.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
Matt, come down, please.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
It was my fault!

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Come down and we can talk about this.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
Matt, get down! Please!

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
It's high.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
Steve was never scared.
Matt, please!

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Don't do this.
You didn't push him off.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
I might as well have done.
Matt, please...

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
MATT!

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Just stay back! OK, OK.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
Matt, do you really want Beth
to watch this?

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
To see what you had to see?
Look at her, Matt. Look at her!

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
MATT!

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Help!

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
A bit of help would be good!

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Give me your hand!

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Don't worry, we won't let you go.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
We met here.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
Steve was drunk. I was angry.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
Said he'd dropped me
now he had her - Sophie.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
He wanted to prove he hadn't.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Said we should get wasted,
like we used to.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Mess about.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
He dared me to break in here.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Then I dared him.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
I said he had to
walk round the edge.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
I didn't think he'd do it.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
Steve, I didn't mean it.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
A dare's a dare! Not going to have
you call me a chicken.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Here, hold this.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
Come on, mate, don't be stupid,
just get down.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Just got to get me balance,
all right?

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Steve, come on. Get down!

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Look, Steve, you've done it now,
just get down.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Told you I could do it.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Steve! Hey!!!

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Aaaaargh! STEVE!

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
I keep hearing it...

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
him screaming.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
I didn't know what to do.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
So you cleared away the cans.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
Threw his phone over the cliff
and left him.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
And then you met me.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Pretended it never happened.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Used me as your alibi.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
I'm sorry...

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
Sophie, this is Steve's mum.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
Mrs Kernan?

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Call me May, love.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Come and sit down.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
How are you doing?

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
I'm never having
a boyfriend ever again.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
Course you will.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
Only if you and Davey
interrogate him first.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Good on May for chucking John out.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
If a man laid a finger on me...

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Lucky I picked a good 'un!

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
HE GROWLS

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
Right, come on, then, who wants
to get thrashed at darts?

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
Just beaten Clint three times.
You've got an unfair advantage,

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
I'm short-sighted.
Can't. Beth and I have got a date.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Pizza and a horror movie.
Cheer me up.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Right, well,
if there's any pepperoni going?

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
Or Hawaiian. I'm easy,
I'll take whatever's going.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
Sorry, girls only.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
See you tomorrow.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Right, come on, then, rematch?

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Only this time,
I'll let you stand a bit closer.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
All rise for Her Majesty's Coroner.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
What would your doctor discover
if they moved in with you?

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Is this how you eat every day?

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
This is just what I'm used to.

45:04.305 --> 45:10.508
