WEBVTT

00:54.096 --> 00:56.639
Here we are, ma'am, Crawley House.

00:58.517 --> 01:00.184
For good or ill.

01:09.653 --> 01:12.530
(SIGHS) I still don't see why
I couldn'tjust refuse it.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.866
There's no mechanism for you to do so.

01:14.950 --> 01:17.452
You will be an earl.
You will inherit the estate.

01:17.578 --> 01:21.956
Ofcourse, you can throw it away
when you have it. That's up to you.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.125
Can I help?

01:24.209 --> 01:27.044
I'm Molesley, sir, your butler and valet.

01:27.546 --> 01:29.964
- Mr Molesley, I'm afraid...
- May I introduce ourselves?

01:30.048 --> 01:33.968
I am Mrs Crawley and this is my son,
Mr Matthew Crawley.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.512
I'll just give Mr Taylor a hand with the cases.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.848
- I can...
- Thank you, Molesley.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.562
I won't let them change me.

01:44.646 --> 01:45.772
Why would they want to?

01:45.856 --> 01:48.566
Mother, Lord Grantham has made
the unwelcome discovery

01:48.650 --> 01:52.153
that his heir is a middle-class lawyer
and the son of a middle-class doctor.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.488
Upper middle class.

01:53.572 --> 01:56.365
He wants to limit the damage
by turning me into one of his own kind.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.368
When you met him in London, you liked him.

01:59.620 --> 02:03.498
I simply do not understand
why we are rushing into this.

02:03.582 --> 02:05.583
Matthew Crawley is my heir.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.002
Patrick was your heir, he never lived here.

02:08.086 --> 02:10.254
Patrick was in and out ofthis house
since the day he was born.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.924
You saw how many ofthe village
turned out for the service.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.342
But nothing's settled yet.

02:14.426 --> 02:17.637
It is settled, my dearest one,
whether you like it or not.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.597
I wouldn't say that.

02:19.681 --> 02:22.308
Not while your mother breathes air.

02:29.900 --> 02:35.404
Oh, Ellen. This is much better than I thought
it would be. You have done well.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.948
Thank you, ma'am.

02:37.032 --> 02:39.116
Would you like this in here, ma'am,
or taken up to your room?

02:39.201 --> 02:41.035
In here, thank you.

02:41.537 --> 02:45.456
So, are you
the whole ofour new household?

02:45.624 --> 02:47.750
There's a local girl, ma'am, Beth.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.169
She's to double under-housemaid
and kitchen maid.

02:50.254 --> 02:53.589
- This is ridiculous.
- Thank you very much, Molesley.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.926
- Might we have some tea?
- Very good, ma'am.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.808
- Well, he can go right now.
- Why?

03:03.892 --> 03:08.145
Because we do not need a butler or a valet,
if it comes to that.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.439
We've always managed perfectly well
with a cook and a maid,

03:10.524 --> 03:11.983
and they cannot expect us to alter our...

03:12.067 --> 03:14.986
What they expect, Matthew,
is that we won't know how to behave.

03:15.070 --> 03:19.282
So ifyou don't mind,
I would rather not confirm their expectations.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.617
I have to be myself, Mother.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.537
I'll be no use to anyone if I can't be myself.

03:24.621 --> 03:29.041
And before they or you get any ideas,
I will choose my own wife.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.418
What on earth do you mean?

03:30.502 --> 03:32.712
Well, they're clearly going to push
one ofthe daughters at me.

03:32.796 --> 03:35.172
They'll have fixed on that
when they heard I was a bachelor.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.049
Lady Mary Crawley.

03:38.844 --> 03:41.220
I do hope I'm not interrupting.

03:42.055 --> 03:45.182
- Lady Mary...
- Cousin Mary, please.

03:45.267 --> 03:49.270
Mama has sent me down to welcome you
and to ask you to dine with us tonight.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.397
Unless you're too tired.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.107
We would be delighted.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.109
Good. Come at 8:00.

03:55.694 --> 03:58.237
Won't you stay and have some tea?

03:58.363 --> 04:02.700
Oh, no, you're far too busy.
And I wouldn't want to push in.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.377
Lynch, I think we'll go back
by the South Lodge.

04:13.462 --> 04:14.545
Very good, my lady.

04:14.630 --> 04:17.798
Lady Mary, I hope you didn't
misunderstand me. I was only joking.

04:17.883 --> 04:20.593
Ofcourse. And I agree.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.429
The whole thing is a complete joke.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.393
THOMAS: So what do you think
we'll make ofthem?

04:29.478 --> 04:32.355
I shouldn't think much.
She hasn't even got a lady's maid.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.689
It's not a capital offence.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.900
She's got a maid, her name's Ellen.
She came a day earlier.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.443
She's not a lady's maid.

04:37.527 --> 04:40.821
She's just a housemaid that fastens
hooks and buttons when she has to.

04:40.906 --> 04:43.199
- There's more to it than that, you know.
- MRS PATMORE: Daisy!

04:43.283 --> 04:45.910
We'll want some very precise reporting
when dinner's over.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.536
Are we to treat him as the heir?

04:47.621 --> 04:51.540
Are we heck as like.
A doctor's son from Manchester?

04:51.625 --> 04:53.668
He'll be lucky if he gets a civil word
out of me.

04:53.752 --> 04:56.504
We're all lucky ifwe get a civil word
out ofyou.

04:56.588 --> 04:59.674
Gwen, parcel for you.
Came by the evening post.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.676
Thank you, Mr Carson.

05:02.094 --> 05:05.513
- William.
- Have you seen them yet, Mr Carson?

05:05.597 --> 05:09.684
By "them" I assume you mean the new family,
in which case, no.

05:09.768 --> 05:12.687
I have that pleasure to look forward to
this evening.

05:13.605 --> 05:16.524
Daisy, did you hear me call
or have you gone selectively deaf?

05:16.608 --> 05:17.692
No, Mrs Patmore.

05:17.776 --> 05:21.404
Then might I remind you we are preparing
dinner for your future employer.

05:21.488 --> 05:24.699
And if it goes wrong, I'll be telling them why.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.373
Why are they here at all
when you're going to undo it?

05:33.250 --> 05:36.002
Your father's not convinced
it can be undone.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.920
But you'll still try.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.423
Granny and I are willing to try.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.508
And Papa is not?

05:42.592 --> 05:44.427
We'll bring him round, you'll see.

05:44.553 --> 05:47.680
We're trying to find a lawyer
who'll take in on.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.849
So what are they like?

05:50.017 --> 05:54.687
She's nice enough,
but he's... very full of himself.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.440
- Why do you say that?
- Just an impression.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.942
Let's go down
and you can decide for yourself.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.281
Hello again.

06:05.782 --> 06:08.034
It's a pleasure to meet you at last,
Mrs Crawley.

06:08.118 --> 06:11.787
We're delighted to be here,
aren't we, Matthew?

06:11.872 --> 06:13.414
Delighted.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.476
Welcome to Downton.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.562
Thank you. You've been so kind.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.315
What a reception committee.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.403
Yes, thank you.

06:44.488 --> 06:47.656
This is Carson. We'd all be lost without him.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.161
Mama, may I present
Matthew Crawley and Mrs Crawley.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.622
My mother, Lady Grantham.

06:55.999 --> 06:58.417
What should we call each other?

06:58.668 --> 07:02.922
Well, we could always start with
Mrs Crawley and Lady Grantham.

07:05.759 --> 07:10.513
Come into the drawing room and we can
make all the proper introductions.

07:19.481 --> 07:24.026
Do you think you'll enjoy village life?
It'll be very quiet after life in the city.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.861
Even Manchester.

07:26.488 --> 07:29.115
I'm sure I'll find something to keep me busy.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.117
You might like the hospital.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.786
What sort of hospital is it? How many beds?

07:33.870 --> 07:36.372
Well, it isn't really a hospital.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.791
Don't let Dr Clarkson hear you.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.876
He thinks it's second only to St Thomas'.

07:41.002 --> 07:44.463
It's a college hospital, ofcourse,
but quite well equipped.

07:44.548 --> 07:45.714
Who pays for it?

07:45.841 --> 07:48.384
Oh, good, let's talk about money.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.720
My father gave the building
and an endowment to run it.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.974
In a way, he set up his own memorial.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.308
MRS CRAWLEY: But how splendid.

07:56.393 --> 07:59.728
ROBERT: And Mr Lloyd George's
new insurance measures will help.

07:59.813 --> 08:03.983
Please don't speak that man's name.
We are about to eat.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.570
I will hold it steady
and you can help yourself, sir.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.573
Yes, I know. Thank you.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.910
You'll soon get used to the way
things are done here.

08:15.036 --> 08:20.416
Lfyou mean that I'm accustomed to a very
different life from this, then that is true.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.418
What will you do with your time?

08:22.502 --> 08:26.338
I've got ajob in Ripon,
and I've said I'll start tomorrow.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.506
Ajob?

08:27.591 --> 08:30.759
In a partnership. You might have heard of it.
Harvell and Carter.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.762
They need someone who understands
industrial law, I'm glad to say.

08:33.889 --> 08:37.266
Although I'm afraid most of it will be
wills and conveyancing.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.769
You do know I mean to involve you
in the running ofthe estate?

08:40.854 --> 08:44.023
Oh, don't worry.
There are plenty of hours in the day.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.358
And ofcourse I'll have the weekend.

08:46.443 --> 08:49.862
We'll discuss this later,
we mustn't bore the ladies.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.031
What is a weekend?

08:56.119 --> 08:57.786
Why shouldn't he be a lawyer?

08:57.871 --> 09:00.539
Gentlemen don't work, silly.
Not real gentlemen.

09:00.624 --> 09:01.707
Don't listen to her, Daisy.

09:01.791 --> 09:05.544
No! Listen to me,
and take those kidneys up to the server

09:05.629 --> 09:08.464
before I knock you down
and serve your brains as fritters!

09:08.548 --> 09:10.382
DAISY: Yes, Mrs Patmore.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.635
Wonder what that Mr Molesley
makes ofthem.

09:12.719 --> 09:16.138
Poor old Molesley.
I pity the man who's taken thatjob.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.599
Then why did you apply for it?

09:19.643 --> 09:22.645
I felt it might help me
to get away from you, Mr Bates.

09:24.481 --> 09:27.149
I'm so interested to see the hospital.

09:27.275 --> 09:31.237
Ooh. Well, you would be,
with your late husband a doctor.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.405
Notjust my husband.

09:33.490 --> 09:36.492
My father and brother, too.
And I trained as a nurse during the war.

09:36.618 --> 09:37.993
Oh, fancy.

09:38.662 --> 09:41.580
I'd love to be involved in some way.

09:41.665 --> 09:44.750
Well, you could always help with
the bring-and-buy sale next month.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.294
That would be most appreciated.

09:50.674 --> 09:53.509
She's a match for the old lady,
she wasn't going to give in.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.679
What old lady are you referring to, Thomas?

09:56.805 --> 10:00.182
You cannot mean her ladyship,
the Dowager Countess.

10:00.308 --> 10:02.101
Not ifyou wish to remain in this house.

10:02.185 --> 10:03.852
No, Mr Carson.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.439
William!

10:08.191 --> 10:11.610
Are you aware the seam at your shoulder
is coming apart?

10:11.695 --> 10:13.946
I felt it go a bit earlier on.
I'll mend it when we turn in.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.782
You will mend it now and you will
never again appear in public

10:16.866 --> 10:18.534
in a similar state of undress.

10:18.660 --> 10:19.702
No, Mr Carson.

10:19.828 --> 10:23.956
To progress in your chosen career, William,
you must remember that a good servant,

10:24.040 --> 10:27.710
at all times,
retains a sense of pride and dignity

10:27.794 --> 10:32.298
that reflects the pride and dignity
ofthe family he serves.

10:32.841 --> 10:35.843
And never make me remind you of it again.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.266
I'll do it.

10:43.184 --> 10:46.562
And cheer up, we've all had a smack
from Mr Carson.

10:46.688 --> 10:50.316
You'll be the butler yourselfone day,
then you'll do the smacking.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.859
I could never be like him.

10:51.943 --> 10:54.903
I bet he comes from a line of butlers
that goes back to the Conqueror.

10:55.030 --> 10:57.281
He learned his business and so will you.

10:57.407 --> 11:00.200
Even Mr Carson wasn't born
standing to attention.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.786
I hope not for his mother's sake.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.713
This was at the back door.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.590
Thank you, William.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.085
It's kind ofyou to take an interest.

11:51.169 --> 11:54.296
I'm afraid it's a case of
the warhorse and the drum.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.007
You know my late husband was a doctor.

11:57.133 --> 12:01.678
I do. I'm familiar with Dr Crawley's work
on the symptoms of infection in children.

12:01.805 --> 12:06.350
Oh. Even I studied nursing
during the South African war.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.518
Really?

12:07.644 --> 12:09.269
(SOBBING)

12:12.107 --> 12:15.567
Very distressing. Young farmer, John Drake.

12:15.652 --> 12:18.612
A tenant of Lord Grantham's.
He came in today.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.864
It's dropsy, I'm afraid.

12:21.366 --> 12:24.034
- May I see him?
- Yeah. By all means.

12:31.167 --> 12:35.838
- Is the dropsy ofthe liver or the heart?
- Everything points to the heart.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.884
(COUGHING)

12:41.636 --> 12:44.805
All right, Mr Drake, you're in safe hands now.

12:49.853 --> 12:52.312
What will happen to his wife?

12:52.397 --> 12:54.481
She may try to keep the farm on.

12:54.566 --> 12:58.735
Grantham is not a harsh landlord,
but her children are young.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.531
What can I do to help?

13:03.366 --> 13:06.910
If I'm to live in this village,
I must have an occupation.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.746
Please. Let me be useful.

13:11.249 --> 13:13.667
He chooses his clothes himself.

13:14.878 --> 13:18.589
He puts them out at night
and hangs the ones he's worn.

13:20.383 --> 13:23.177
I get to take the linen down to the laundry.
But that's about all.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.344
That's all?

13:24.429 --> 13:28.724
"I'll do this", he says, "I'll take the other".
"I'll tie that".

13:29.225 --> 13:33.937
And I'm just stood there like a chump
watching a man get dressed.

13:35.899 --> 13:40.402
To be honest, Mr Bates,
I don't see the point of it.

13:41.404 --> 13:43.697
ROBERT: I thought you didn't like him.

13:43.781 --> 13:47.326
Well, so what?
I have plenty offriends I don't like.

13:47.410 --> 13:50.537
Would you want Mary to marry one ofthem?

13:50.788 --> 13:54.917
Why do you always have to pretend to be
nicer than the rest of us?

13:55.043 --> 13:56.335
Perhaps I am.

13:56.419 --> 14:00.547
Then pity your wife, whose fortune must go
to this odd young man,

14:00.632 --> 14:03.675
who talks about "weekends" and "jobs".

14:03.760 --> 14:07.763
(SCOFFS) If Mary were to marry him
then all would be resolved.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.688
What've you got there?

14:16.773 --> 14:18.106
Nothing.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.692
What kind of nothing?

14:20.777 --> 14:23.070
You haven't got an admirer?

14:23.738 --> 14:26.114
I might have. Why shouldn't I?

14:26.241 --> 14:30.035
Don't tell Mrs Hughes or she'll bring
the vicar round to have you exorcised.

14:30.119 --> 14:34.331
How are we supposed to find husbands
ifwe're never allowed to see any men?

14:34.457 --> 14:37.459
Perhaps she thinks the stork brings them.

14:42.131 --> 14:45.384
Eh. Lady Mary's in for a surprise.

14:45.468 --> 14:49.096
Thomas was in the library
when old Violet came in from the garden.

14:49.180 --> 14:52.057
Seems they want to fix her up
with Mr Crawley.

14:52.141 --> 14:55.936
Well, it makes sense.
She was going to marry Mr Patrick.

14:56.020 --> 15:00.148
Would she have, though, when it came to it?
That's the question.

15:06.698 --> 15:10.325
Ah, there you are, dear.
I was hoping you'd be home in time.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.868
In time for what?

15:11.995 --> 15:15.038
I've been paid the compliment of a visit.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.505
- Hello.
- Good afternoon, cousin Matthew.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.048
Afternoon.

15:26.342 --> 15:29.428
We were just saying how charming
this room is now.

15:29.512 --> 15:34.016
Mmm. It always seemed rather dark
when my mother-in-law lived here.

15:34.142 --> 15:37.561
But then she made everything rather dark.
(CHUCKLES)

15:37.687 --> 15:39.855
- Sir.
- No, thank you.

15:40.732 --> 15:44.359
- A cup oftea, sir?
- It's all right. I'll help myself.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.532
So, Molesley,

15:51.868 --> 15:55.954
how do you find being home again?
Your father must be glad you're back.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.206
He is, your ladyship.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.255
Might I give you this cup?

16:06.716 --> 16:08.717
I'm afraid we must be going.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.471
- Thank you.
- You'll think about it?

16:17.226 --> 16:18.935
Ouch!

16:26.235 --> 16:28.820
Oh. I thought no one was here.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.282
Can I help, Mr Carson?

16:32.408 --> 16:33.617
Uh...

16:34.410 --> 16:37.079
No. No, thank you, Anna.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.003
May I?

16:46.923 --> 16:49.257
I must compliment you, Mrs Crawley.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.761
When you made your offer,
I thought you might be a "great lady nurse"

16:52.845 --> 16:55.305
and faint at the sight of blood.

16:55.765 --> 16:58.767
But I see you're made ofsterner stuff.

17:01.354 --> 17:05.273
It's definitely the heart.
It's almost too quiet to hear at all.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.692
I'm afraid so.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.444
I've been thinking about
the treatments that are available.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.739
Considerable success have been achieved
over the last few years

17:12.824 --> 17:15.617
by draining the pericardial sac
ofthe excess fluid

17:15.702 --> 17:17.452
and administering adrenaline.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.789
Mrs Crawley, I appreciate your thoroughness.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.582
But you're unwilling to try it?

17:22.667 --> 17:25.752
Injection of adrenaline
is a comparatively new procedure.

17:25.837 --> 17:29.715
It's a while ago now,
but I saw my husband do it. I know how.

17:29.799 --> 17:33.927
Please, Mrs Crawley,
don't force me to be uncivil.

17:34.011 --> 17:37.013
We would be setting an impossible precedent

17:37.140 --> 17:40.892
when every villager could demand
the latest fad in treatment

17:40.977 --> 17:42.894
for each new cut and graze.

17:42.979 --> 17:46.273
I would remind you that we're not talking
of a cut or a graze,

17:46.357 --> 17:48.775
but the loss of a man's life
and the ruin of his family.

17:48.860 --> 17:53.530
Ofcourse. But I beg you to see
that it is not reasonable.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.035
I'm sorry but I have standards.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.871
I've just seen something ever so odd.

18:00.997 --> 18:04.249
And if anyone thinks I'm going
to pull my forelock and curtsey to this

18:04.333 --> 18:06.084
Mr Nobody from Nowhere...

18:06.169 --> 18:07.544
O'Brien!

18:08.504 --> 18:10.839
Were you discussing Mr Crawley?

18:11.758 --> 18:12.841
Yes, my lady.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.177
Is it your place to do so?

18:16.679 --> 18:20.432
I've got my opinions, my lady,
same as anybody.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.267
Can I help, your ladyship?

18:22.351 --> 18:24.394
This is the button we're missing
from my new evening coat.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.146
I found it lying on the gravel.

18:26.230 --> 18:31.610
But I was shocked at the talk I heard
as I came in.

18:32.236 --> 18:35.739
Mr Crawley is his lordship's cousin and heir.

18:35.865 --> 18:40.202
You will therefore, please, accord him
the respect he's entitled to.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.997
But you don't like him yourself, my lady.
You never wanted him to...

18:44.081 --> 18:47.542
You're sailing perilously close
to the wind, O'Brien.

18:47.627 --> 18:51.797
Lfwe're to be friends, you will not speak
in that way again about the Crawleys

18:51.881 --> 18:54.966
or any member of Lord Grantham's family.

18:56.427 --> 19:00.096
Now I'm going up to rest.
Wake me at the dressing gong.

19:08.272 --> 19:11.233
I don't think that's fair,
not here in the servant's hall.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.609
I agree.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.737
Lfshe was a real lady,
she wouldn't have come down here.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.948
She'd have rung for me
and given me the button, that's all.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.325
This isn't her territory.
We can say what we like down here.

19:20.451 --> 19:21.535
Who says?

19:21.619 --> 19:23.829
The law. And Parliament.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.081
There is such a thing as free speech.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.250
Not when I'm in charge.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.212
Don't push your luck, Thomas.

19:32.296 --> 19:36.132
Now, tea's over. Back to work.
You'd better take this.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.762
Friends.

19:41.264 --> 19:43.682
Who does she think she's fooling?
We're not friends.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.559
- No?
- No.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.978
And you're not friends with the girls neither.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.646
We're servants, you and me.

19:49.772 --> 19:52.941
And they pay us to do as we're told,
that's all.

19:55.611 --> 19:58.363
- May I...
- I can manage.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.575
Now where have I put my cuff links?

20:01.659 --> 20:03.076
I thought these would make a change.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.537
I want my usual ones.

20:07.623 --> 20:11.585
I know I'm a disappointment to you,
Molesley. But it's no good.

20:11.669 --> 20:14.754
I'll never get used to being dressed
like a doll.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.591
- Only trying to help, sir.
- Ofcourse.

20:17.675 --> 20:19.467
And if I've offended you, I apologise.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.887
Surely you have better things to do.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.930
This is my job, sir.

20:24.015 --> 20:28.310
Well. (CHUCKLES) It seems a very
silly occupation for a grown man.

20:33.524 --> 20:35.650
Look, I'm sorry if I'm...

20:38.362 --> 20:39.863
I'm sorry.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.164
Why are you so against him?

20:49.248 --> 20:52.042
Aside from the fact he's planning
to steal our inheritance?

20:52.168 --> 20:53.919
Your inheritance.

20:54.337 --> 20:56.796
It makes no difference to Sybil and me.

20:56.881 --> 20:59.633
We won't inherit, whatever happens.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.635
He isn't one of us.

21:01.719 --> 21:05.305
Cousin Freddie's studying for the bar,
and so is Vivian MacDonald.

21:05.389 --> 21:09.643
MARY: At Lincoln's Inn.
Not sitting at a dirty little desk in Ripon.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.519
Besides, his father was a doctor.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.147
SYBIL: There's nothing wrong with doctors.
We all need doctors.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.191
We all need crossing sweepers
and draymen, too.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.734
It doesn't mean we have to dine with them.

21:17.818 --> 21:20.403
Whom don't we have to dine with?

21:20.488 --> 21:23.198
Mary doesn't care for Cousin Matthew.

21:25.159 --> 21:27.744
Sybil, be a dear
and fetch my black evening shawl.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.871
O'Brien knows which one.

21:30.790 --> 21:34.417
And, Edith, can you see
that the drawing room's ready?

21:40.466 --> 21:42.300
I'm glad to catch you alone.

21:42.385 --> 21:45.345
- You've driven the others away.
- (LAUGHS) Oh, perhaps I have.

21:45.429 --> 21:46.680
Pretty.

21:48.641 --> 21:52.102
The point is, my dear, I don't want you,
any ofyou,

21:53.104 --> 21:55.730
to feel you have to dislike Matthew.

21:56.524 --> 21:59.317
- You disliked the idea of him.
- That was before he came.

21:59.402 --> 22:03.655
Now he's here, I don't see any future in it.
Not the way things are.

22:03.739 --> 22:06.408
I don't believe a woman can be forced
to give away all her money

22:06.492 --> 22:08.493
to a distant cousin of her husband's.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.371
Not in the 20th century.
It's too ludicrous for words.

22:11.455 --> 22:14.541
It's not as simple as that.
The money isn't mine any more.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.418
It forms a part ofthe estate.

22:16.502 --> 22:17.752
Even so, when ajudge hears...

22:17.837 --> 22:21.256
For once in your life,
will you please just listen!

22:23.801 --> 22:25.969
I believe there's an answer

22:26.512 --> 22:30.056
which would secure your future
and give you a position.

22:30.933 --> 22:32.767
You can't be serious.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.310
Just think about it.

22:34.395 --> 22:36.396
I don't have to think about it.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.315
Marry a man who can barely hold his knife
like a gentleman?

22:39.400 --> 22:41.484
(LAUGHING) Oh, you exaggerate.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.820
You're American,
you don't understand these things.

22:43.904 --> 22:46.865
Have you mentioned this to Granny?
Did she laugh?

22:46.949 --> 22:49.325
Why would she? It was her idea.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.372
ROBERT: Have you been able
to explore the village?

22:54.457 --> 22:55.790
MRS CRAWLEY: Indeed I have.

22:55.875 --> 22:59.419
And I thought the hospital a great credit
to your father's memory.

22:59.503 --> 23:02.672
But I'm afraid the good doctor and I
did not see eye to eye.

23:02.757 --> 23:05.008
(CHUCKLES) Oh, you amaze me!

23:05.760 --> 23:09.554
He's treating one ofyour tenants,
John Drake, for dropsy,

23:09.764 --> 23:12.682
but seems reluctant to embrace
some ofthe newer treatments.

23:12.767 --> 23:15.435
Oh, Drake is a good man
and far too young to die,

23:15.519 --> 23:17.896
but I suppose the doctor knows his business.

23:18.189 --> 23:21.149
Not as well as Mrs Crawley, apparently.

23:21.776 --> 23:24.402
By the way, ifever you want to ride,

23:24.487 --> 23:26.613
just let Lynch know
and he'll sort it out for you.

23:26.697 --> 23:29.616
Oh, Papa, Cousin Matthew doesn't ride.

23:29.700 --> 23:30.950
I ride.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.913
And do you hunt?

23:35.206 --> 23:36.581
No, I don't hunt.

23:36.665 --> 23:40.752
I dare say there's not much opportunity
in Manchester. (LAUGHS)

23:42.797 --> 23:44.172
Are you a hunting family?

23:44.256 --> 23:46.508
Families like ours
are always hunting families.

23:46.592 --> 23:48.176
ROBERT: Not always.

23:48.260 --> 23:52.597
- Billy Skelton won't have them on his land.
- MARY: But all the Skeltons are mad.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.140
Do you hunt?

23:54.391 --> 23:55.892
Occasionally.

23:56.560 --> 24:00.313
I suppose you're more interested in books
than country sports.

24:00.397 --> 24:01.940
I probably am.

24:02.191 --> 24:05.902
- You'll tell me that's rather unhealthy.
- MARY: Not unhealthy.

24:05.986 --> 24:09.072
Just unusual. Among our kind of people.

24:14.745 --> 24:17.330
(WHISPERING) I'm changing round
the dessert services.

24:17.414 --> 24:20.583
We're missing a sugar sifter.
I know I put three out.

24:20.668 --> 24:23.211
I was talking to Anna earlier.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.713
Why? What's she been saying?

24:26.257 --> 24:29.300
- Whatever's the matter?
- What did Anna say?

24:29.552 --> 24:32.637
Only that she thinks
Thomas is bullying William.

24:32.721 --> 24:36.891
Ah. Yeah, she may have a point.
I'll keep an eye out.

24:39.395 --> 24:40.812
Here it is.

24:43.440 --> 24:47.569
MARY: I've been studying
the story ofAndromeda. Do you know it?

24:47.695 --> 24:48.736
Why?

24:48.821 --> 24:53.491
Her father was King Cepheus
whose country was being ravaged by storms.

24:54.076 --> 24:57.078
And in the end,
he decided the only way to appease the gods

24:57.163 --> 25:01.166
was to sacrifice his eldest daughter
to a hideous sea monster.

25:01.876 --> 25:06.880
- So they chained her naked to a rock...
- COUNTESS: (LAUGHING) Really, Mary,

25:07.506 --> 25:10.800
we'll all need our smelling salts in a minute.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.012
But the sea monster didn't get her, did he?

25:14.096 --> 25:15.430
MARY: No.

25:15.556 --> 25:17.390
Just when it seemed
he was the only solution

25:17.474 --> 25:20.393
to her father's problems, she was rescued.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.270
By Perseus.

25:22.771 --> 25:26.691
That's right. Perseus. Son of a god.

25:27.902 --> 25:30.737
Rather more fitting, wouldn't you say?

25:30.821 --> 25:32.322
That depends.

25:32.406 --> 25:36.910
I'd have to know more about the princess
and sea monster in question.

are destined to be close friends.

Hmm.

I don't blame her.

are to be passed to me. It's very harsh.

were set aside in Mary's favour?

27:07.543 --> 27:11.713
I should try to accept it
with as good a grace as I could muster.

27:13.507 --> 27:15.216
Would you?

27:16.135 --> 27:19.721
- Oh. Oh, good evening, Taylor.
- Good evening, my lady.

27:20.222 --> 27:21.681
Thank you.

27:23.684 --> 27:25.727
I'll say good night, Mr Carson.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.562
Look at that scratch.

27:27.646 --> 27:31.232
I'll have to get that sorted out
when they're up in London.

27:31.317 --> 27:34.819
- You can hardly see it.
- Well, I'll know it's there.

27:35.696 --> 27:38.906
Are you all right now?
Only you seemed a little upset earlier.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.743
Yeah. I'm sorry about that. I'm just...

27:42.870 --> 27:44.495
I'm a bit tired.

27:44.580 --> 27:47.165
And no wonder. Did the dinner go well?

27:47.249 --> 27:48.833
Oh, well enough.

27:48.917 --> 27:52.170
Although they won't make a match
between them ifthat's what they're thinking.

27:52.254 --> 27:54.005
Lady Mary doesn't like him?

27:54.089 --> 27:56.090
And why should she like the man
she's been passed over for?

27:56.216 --> 27:58.843
And why has she been?
That's what I'd like to know.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.428
It's the law.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.555
Well, it's a wicked law.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.937
Why does Mr Carson let you do that?

28:10.022 --> 28:12.440
Because my dad was a clockmaker.

28:13.192 --> 28:16.611
Did you really ask him
for the job at the Crawleys'?

28:16.779 --> 28:18.196
I'm sick of being a footman.

28:18.280 --> 28:22.367
I'd rather be a footman than wait on someone
who ought to be a footman himself.

28:22.451 --> 28:25.411
But Mr Carson shouldn't have told Bates.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.207
How are things with Lady G?

28:29.458 --> 28:31.125
Same as usual.

28:31.251 --> 28:33.378
"Yes, my lady. No, my lady.
Three bags full."

28:33.462 --> 28:37.215
I'd like to give her three bags full,
preferably on a dark night.

28:37.299 --> 28:39.300
Will you hand in your notice?

28:39.426 --> 28:43.304
And let her ruin me with a nasty reference?
Oh, I think not.

28:46.058 --> 28:49.894
I don't want to exaggerate.
She's been very generous in many ways.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.312
Generous?

28:51.814 --> 28:54.065
To instruct you in your own practice?

28:54.149 --> 28:56.567
Well, she may even have a point,

28:57.111 --> 28:59.153
but it does not seem to me realistic.

28:59.279 --> 29:01.114
Well. Nor is it.

29:01.323 --> 29:03.408
Put an end to her meddling.

29:03.492 --> 29:06.786
I am your president and I say get rid of her.

29:07.788 --> 29:09.831
Will that not be awkward?

29:10.165 --> 29:13.668
I gather she's planning to stay in the village
for the foreseeable future.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.170
No one can foresee the future, Doctor.

29:16.255 --> 29:19.465
Not you, not I, and certainly not Mrs Crawley.

29:27.975 --> 29:30.309
You do not love the place yet?

29:31.061 --> 29:34.355
- Well, obviously it's...
- No, you don't love it.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.607
You see a million bricks that may crumble,

29:36.692 --> 29:39.444
a thousand gutters and pipes
that may block and leak,

29:39.528 --> 29:41.529
and stone that will crack in the frost.

29:43.073 --> 29:44.657
But you don't?

29:46.535 --> 29:48.411
I see my life's work.

29:52.374 --> 29:53.749
Was it ever in danger?

29:53.876 --> 29:55.751
(CHUCKLES) Many times.

29:56.712 --> 30:00.131
My dear Papa thought the balloon
would go up in the 1880s.

30:00.215 --> 30:01.757
What saved it?

30:03.093 --> 30:04.260
Cora.

30:09.683 --> 30:11.392
Where is everyone?

30:12.060 --> 30:13.311
They've gone down to the village.

30:13.395 --> 30:17.440
Some travelling salesman's set up at the pub
for the afternoon.

30:17.566 --> 30:19.192
Alone at last.

30:21.111 --> 30:23.863
We shouldn't be without both footmen.

30:24.448 --> 30:26.324
Does Mr Carson know?

30:26.408 --> 30:29.285
Mrs Hughes does. She's gone with them.

30:29.411 --> 30:31.204
They won't be long.

30:33.749 --> 30:38.085
So, you see to the girls
and you're supposed to be head housemaid.

30:38.754 --> 30:40.421
You should put in for a raise.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.757
What do you mean, "supposed to be"?

30:42.883 --> 30:43.883
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

30:43.967 --> 30:45.218
(BELL DINGING)

30:49.556 --> 30:52.183
I said they shouldn't
have let both footmen go.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.018
Well, you'll have to answer it.

30:54.102 --> 30:56.479
Mr Carson wouldn't like
a maid answering the front door.

31:03.237 --> 31:05.780
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, sir.

31:05.906 --> 31:08.282
I'm here to see Lord Grantham.

31:08.825 --> 31:10.952
- Is he expecting you?
- No.

31:11.119 --> 31:14.789
But he'll be very interested
in what I have to tell him.

31:14.957 --> 31:16.999
His lordship is not at home,
but ifyou will leave your name...

31:17.125 --> 31:20.419
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh,
don't go all high and mighty with me.

31:20.504 --> 31:22.713
I don't know who you are,
but you're certainly not the butler.

31:22.798 --> 31:24.924
So don't try and make out you are.

31:25.008 --> 31:26.676
How do you know?

31:27.302 --> 31:30.513
Because Charlie Carson's
the butler round here.

31:31.348 --> 31:33.724
Does your business concern him?

31:34.017 --> 31:35.560
It might do.

31:37.062 --> 31:39.397
Excuse me for one moment, sir.

31:43.652 --> 31:46.153
Fetch Mr Carson as fast as you can.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.324
Use the front door.

31:53.662 --> 31:56.163
- Lfyou would like to follow me, sir.
- Oh, no.

31:56.248 --> 31:57.915
Lfyou think
you're tucking me away somewhere,

31:58.000 --> 31:59.208
you've got another think coming.

31:59.334 --> 32:02.712
- But you'll be more comfortable, sir.
- Sorry, chum.

32:09.052 --> 32:12.513
Oh, aye. I'll not mind waiting in here.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.025
Bates.

32:25.193 --> 32:29.113
This gentleman is an acquaintance
of Mr Carson, my lady.

32:29.197 --> 32:30.948
What is he doing in here?

32:31.033 --> 32:33.451
He says he has urgent business
with his lordship.

32:33.535 --> 32:34.785
Urgent.

32:36.204 --> 32:39.040
I've sent for Mr Carson to come at once.

32:39.374 --> 32:43.044
Then I'll stay with you
in case explanations are needed.

32:47.049 --> 32:48.924
(PANTING) Mr Carson!

32:50.552 --> 32:52.637
You're needed at once in the library.

32:53.263 --> 32:57.516
GRIGG: How long are you expecting me
to wait? I'm a very busy man, you know.

32:57.601 --> 32:59.727
BATES: Lfyou could just be patient
for a little longer, sir.

33:02.814 --> 33:03.898
Oh.

33:05.192 --> 33:08.527
May I ask who this is
and precisely what is going on?

33:08.612 --> 33:11.197
CARSON: Mr Bates, what are you...

33:11.323 --> 33:14.075
Uh, I'm sorry, your lordship.

33:15.952 --> 33:17.244
Mr Bates, you may go now.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.288
Please stay where you are.
Nobody's going anywhere.

33:19.373 --> 33:21.707
Do I take it you know this man?

33:21.792 --> 33:23.376
Don't try and deny it.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.294
No, I won't deny it.

33:25.587 --> 33:29.131
I do know him, my lord,
but not what he is doing in the library.

33:29.216 --> 33:32.093
I tried to stick him downstairs, out ofsight,
Mr Carson, but he wouldn't come.

33:32.177 --> 33:34.387
Yes, thank you. That was thoughtful.

33:34.471 --> 33:36.013
But who is he?

33:37.933 --> 33:40.226
Will you tell him or shall I?

33:40.519 --> 33:45.064
His name is Charles Grigg.
We worked together at one time.

33:45.649 --> 33:49.068
Oh. I'm a little more than that,
aren't I, Charlie?

33:50.404 --> 33:54.115
- We're like brothers, him and me.
- We're not like brothers.

33:54.199 --> 33:57.118
We were a double act, on the halls.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.371
You were on the stage?

34:01.748 --> 34:03.666
Carson, is this true?

34:04.042 --> 34:05.543
It is, my lord.

34:05.627 --> 34:09.255
"The Cheerful Charlies,"
that's what they called us.

34:10.799 --> 34:12.967
We did quite well, didn't we?

34:13.051 --> 34:15.219
CARSON: Until you couldn't
keep your hands out ofthe till.

34:15.303 --> 34:16.804
Would you like us to go, Mr Carson?

34:16.888 --> 34:18.973
No. You know it now.

34:19.808 --> 34:22.852
You might as well bear witness to my shame.

34:23.437 --> 34:27.648
He turned up in the village
with no warning some days ago, on the run,

34:27.733 --> 34:30.568
asking for somewhere to hide
and, ofcourse, for money.

34:30.652 --> 34:31.777
God in heaven.

34:31.862 --> 34:34.655
He is wanted for some petty crime
ofwhich he is, ofcourse, guilty.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.073
Steady on.

34:36.366 --> 34:42.121
He threatened to expose my past,
to make me a laughing stock in this house.

34:43.039 --> 34:47.293
And in my vanity and pride,
I gave him what he wanted.

34:47.377 --> 34:49.253
(SCOFFS) You did not!

34:50.005 --> 34:53.382
I put him in an empty cottage
and fed him from the kitchens.

34:53.467 --> 34:57.928
I couldn't buy food in the village.
It would raise too many questions.

34:59.347 --> 35:01.307
I stole.

35:01.391 --> 35:02.850
I'm a thief.

35:04.728 --> 35:06.896
She saw it.

35:07.272 --> 35:11.525
- I'd never have said anything...
- And now my disgrace is complete.

35:11.902 --> 35:15.070
My lord, you have my resignation.

35:15.822 --> 35:18.449
Really, Carson, there's no need
to be quite so melodramatic.

35:18.533 --> 35:21.035
You're not playing Sydney Carton.

35:21.787 --> 35:25.873
So, why have you come here
if he has done everything you asked of him?

35:25.957 --> 35:27.708
Because he hasn't.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.084
(GRUNTS)

35:29.836 --> 35:31.337
He wouldn't give me any money.

35:31.421 --> 35:36.008
If I had, how could I prevent his returning
to Downton once it was spent?

35:36.092 --> 35:37.676
(CLEARS THROAT)

35:38.428 --> 35:39.637
My dear Mr Grigg...

35:39.721 --> 35:42.223
Oh, nice to see someone round here's
got some manners.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.016
Hold your tongue!

35:44.100 --> 35:46.310
ROBERT: I'll tell you
what is going to happen.

35:46.394 --> 35:49.939
When I have given you £20,
you will leave Downton immediately

35:50.023 --> 35:52.900
and we will never set eyes on you again.

35:53.735 --> 35:54.944
I'll have to see about that.

35:55.028 --> 35:56.612
Lfyou return to this area,

35:56.696 --> 36:00.407
I will personally ensure your conviction
for theft and blackmail.

36:00.492 --> 36:01.534
Just a minute...

36:01.618 --> 36:05.621
You will serve from five to 10 years
in His Majesty's custody.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.834
You think you're such a big man, don't you?

36:10.210 --> 36:13.671
Just because you're a lord,
you think you can do what you like with me.

36:13.755 --> 36:17.967
I think it... because it is true.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.230
You'll not always be in charge, you know.

36:31.314 --> 36:34.525
The day is coming when your lot will have
to toe the line just like the rest of us.

36:34.609 --> 36:39.446
Perhaps. But happily for Carson,
that day has not come yet.

36:50.458 --> 36:53.794
I take it my resignation
has not been accepted?

36:55.130 --> 36:59.717
My dear fellow, we all have chapters
we would rather keep unpublished.

37:00.969 --> 37:02.887
To be honest, Carson,

37:03.388 --> 37:05.306
I'm rather impressed.

37:05.557 --> 37:09.643
Did you really sing and dance and everything
in front of an audience?

37:09.769 --> 37:10.978
I did.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.647
Do you ever miss it?

37:14.441 --> 37:16.567
Not in the least, my lord.

37:17.819 --> 37:22.990
Poor Mr Carson. We'll have to treat him
like a god for a month to calm his nerves.

37:23.825 --> 37:25.659
He'll be afraid this'll change
the way we think of him.

37:25.785 --> 37:28.329
- Then we mustn't let it.
- Oh, but it will.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.623
"The Cheerful Charlies"?

37:30.832 --> 37:32.333
(GIGGLING)

37:32.459 --> 37:35.002
For all his talk ofdignity,
we know his story now.

37:35.128 --> 37:36.921
And admire him more because of it.

37:37.005 --> 37:40.925
Maybe. But it will change
the way we think of him. It always does.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.843
I don't see why.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.845
I shouldn't care what I found out about you.

37:44.971 --> 37:48.015
Whatever it was,
it wouldn't alter my opinion one bit.

37:48.141 --> 37:50.643
But it would. It certainly would.

37:51.186 --> 37:53.270
COUNTESS: We're running out ofoptions.

37:53.355 --> 37:56.523
The lawyers I write to only huff and puff.

37:57.692 --> 38:00.694
They echo Murray
and say nothing can be done.

38:00.820 --> 38:03.614
Or they don't want the bother
ofopposing him.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.032
Precisely.

38:07.202 --> 38:10.621
I wish Mary wasn't so confident
it could all be put right.

38:10.705 --> 38:14.208
Meanwhile, we have to watch
that dreadful woman

38:14.292 --> 38:16.794
parade around the village as ifshe owned it.

38:16.878 --> 38:18.879
I think she means well.

38:18.964 --> 38:21.090
Meaning well is not enough.

38:21.758 --> 38:26.929
Poor Dr Clarkson.
What has he done to deserve that termagant?

38:28.264 --> 38:31.350
I think he's in
for an uncomfortable afternoon.

38:31.434 --> 38:32.726
Is he? Why?

38:32.852 --> 38:35.104
On my way here,
I saw her go into the hospital.

38:35.230 --> 38:37.731
She looked extremely determined.

38:38.692 --> 38:40.776
Not as determined as I am.

38:42.612 --> 38:45.447
MRS CRAWLEY: I have the adrenaline
here in my hand.

38:45.573 --> 38:48.659
Will you really deny the man
his chance of life?

38:48.743 --> 38:52.037
I just wish it was a treatment
I was more familiar with.

38:52.122 --> 38:55.249
Will that serve as your excuse when he dies?

39:02.757 --> 39:06.760
Nurse. Can you prepare Mr Drake
for his procedure, please?

39:11.433 --> 39:13.142
Well, Mrs Crawley,

39:13.601 --> 39:16.729
I have a feeling we will sink or swim together.

39:17.605 --> 39:21.108
Mr Drake,
your heart is not functioning properly,

39:21.234 --> 39:24.820
and, as a result,
your pericardial sac is full offluid.

39:26.072 --> 39:30.409
I am proposing first to withdraw the fluid
and then to inject the adrenaline

39:30.493 --> 39:33.662
to stimulate the heart
and restore normal activity.

39:33.788 --> 39:35.956
Is it dangerous, Doctor?

39:36.166 --> 39:38.625
The draining may stop the heart,

39:39.127 --> 39:42.296
and the adrenaline
may not be able to restart it.

39:42.422 --> 39:45.132
Mrs Drake, the choice is simple.

39:45.592 --> 39:49.470
Lfyour husband endures this procedure,
he may live. If not, he will die.

39:49.596 --> 39:50.637
(SOBBING)

39:50.764 --> 39:53.640
NURSE: He's with a patient.
COUNTESS: Please, please, no, let me pass!

39:53.767 --> 39:56.435
I must see the doctor at once!

39:56.853 --> 39:58.437
Your ladyship.

39:58.855 --> 40:00.647
It's just as I thought.

40:02.776 --> 40:04.443
Dr Clarkson,

40:04.527 --> 40:09.073
tell me you will not permit this amateur
to influence your professional opinion.

40:09.157 --> 40:10.908
- Amateur?
- My dear woman,

40:10.992 --> 40:12.910
do not let them bully you.

40:12.994 --> 40:15.913
They'll not disturb the peace
ofyour husband's last hours.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.998
Not if I can help it.

40:18.583 --> 40:23.504
But that's just it, my lady.
I don't want them to be his last hours.

40:24.881 --> 40:30.719
Not ifthere's a chance.
Please, Doctor. Do what you must.

40:42.357 --> 40:43.524
As...

40:49.030 --> 40:51.949
- DR CLARKSON: Steady.
- (MRS DRAKE CRYING)

40:54.369 --> 40:56.036
Yeah, all right.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.622
Nice and steady.

41:00.708 --> 41:05.254
- As president ofthis hospital, I feel I must...
- DR CLARKSON: Valve.

41:10.135 --> 41:14.555
...tell you that I shall bring this
to the attention ofthe Board.

41:15.890 --> 41:17.975
You're doing very well.

41:22.063 --> 41:23.730
Have you no pity?

41:26.067 --> 41:27.442
Adrenaline.

41:28.486 --> 41:31.238
Quickly, quickly. His heart's stopped.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.496
- Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

41:46.796 --> 41:47.838
DR CLARKSON: Yes.

41:58.183 --> 42:00.434
(SOBBING) Oh, my God!

42:03.730 --> 42:05.189
Oh, my dear.

42:12.906 --> 42:14.239
ROBERT: You don't have to worry.

42:14.324 --> 42:19.286
She may be president, but I'm the patron,
so you're quite safe with me. Please.

42:20.038 --> 42:23.498
My mother was right, then?
The man's life was saved?

42:24.083 --> 42:27.002
Well, I like to think that we were both right.

42:27.378 --> 42:30.505
But I'm not sure Lady Grantham
will be so easily convinced.

42:30.590 --> 42:33.008
Then we must strengthen the argument.

42:33.092 --> 42:35.552
Cousin Isobel wants something to do.
Very well.

42:35.637 --> 42:39.097
Let's make her Chairman ofthe Board.
She'd like that, wouldn't she?

42:39.182 --> 42:41.058
Certainly, she would.

42:41.142 --> 42:43.018
Then my mother will have to listen to her.

42:43.186 --> 42:45.020
She's been an absolute ruler there
for long enough.

42:45.104 --> 42:47.522
It's time for some loyal opposition.

42:47.607 --> 42:50.108
Lfyou're quite certain, my lord.

42:52.070 --> 42:53.612
What were you going to say?

42:53.696 --> 42:57.658
At the risk of being impertinent,
on your own head be it.

42:59.994 --> 43:01.411
(CHUCKLING)

43:03.498 --> 43:06.250
About your scheme
for restoring the estate cottages.

43:06.334 --> 43:08.252
You don't mind my interfering?

43:08.336 --> 43:11.255
My dear fellow,
I brought you here to interfere.

43:11.339 --> 43:14.341
In fact, why don't you stay for dinner
and we'll talk about it?

43:14.425 --> 43:16.218
We'll send down to Molesley
for your clothes.

43:16.302 --> 43:18.929
I'd better not. My mother's expecting me.

43:19.013 --> 43:22.307
But in fact, I've been meaning
to speak to you about Molesley.

43:22.392 --> 43:23.475
Oh?

43:24.644 --> 43:29.064
Would you find me very ungrateful
if I dispensed with his services?

43:29.148 --> 43:31.191
Why? Has he displeased you in some way?

43:31.276 --> 43:35.696
Not at all. It's simply that he's superfluous
to our style of living.

43:35.780 --> 43:37.239
Is that quite fair?

43:37.323 --> 43:40.117
To deprive a man of his livelihood,
when he's done nothing wrong?

43:40.201 --> 43:41.243
Well, I wouldn't quite put it...

43:41.327 --> 43:44.288
Your mother derives satisfaction
from her work at the hospital, I think?

43:44.372 --> 43:47.082
- Some sense ofselfworth?
- Certainly.

43:47.166 --> 43:50.711
Would you really deny the same
to poor old Molesley?

43:50.795 --> 43:53.338
And when you are master here,
is the butler to be dismissed?

43:53.423 --> 43:55.007
Or the footmen?

43:55.174 --> 43:57.634
How many maids or kitchen staff
will be allowed to stay?

43:57.719 --> 44:00.095
Or must everyone be driven out?

44:01.306 --> 44:04.433
We all have different parts to play, Matthew.

44:04.851 --> 44:07.728
And we must all be allowed to play them.

44:15.778 --> 44:18.363
EDITH: Why must we all go to the hospital?

44:18.448 --> 44:21.950
MARY: I'm afraid Papa
wants to teach Granny a lesson.

44:22.118 --> 44:25.412
Poor Granny. A month ago,
these people were strangers.

44:25.496 --> 44:28.957
Now she must share power with the mother
and I must marry the son.

44:29.042 --> 44:30.876
You won't marry him, though, will you?

44:30.960 --> 44:32.210
What? Marry a sea monster?

44:32.295 --> 44:33.837
(ALL CHUCKLING)

44:33.921 --> 44:36.548
We shouldn't laugh. That was so unkind.

44:36.632 --> 44:38.759
But he must marry someone.

44:39.761 --> 44:41.803
Edith, what are you thinking?

44:41.888 --> 44:44.556
You know, I don't dislike him
as much as you do.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.600
Perhaps you don't dislike him at all.

44:46.684 --> 44:48.518
Perhaps I don't.

44:48.603 --> 44:51.688
MARY: Well, it's nothing to me.
I've bigger fish to fry.

44:51.773 --> 44:55.192
- SYBIL: What fish?
- Are we talking about "EN"?

44:55.276 --> 44:58.070
How do you know that?
Have you been poking around in my things?

44:58.154 --> 45:01.156
- Ofcourse not.
- Come on. Who is he?

45:01.240 --> 45:02.908
It's not fair ifyou both know.

45:02.992 --> 45:06.286
You won't be any the wiser,
but his name is Evelyn Napier.

45:06.371 --> 45:10.624
The Honourable Evelyn Napier.
Son and heir to Viscount Branksome.

45:10.708 --> 45:12.751
Who wants an old sea monster
when they can have Perseus?

45:12.835 --> 45:13.877
(ALL LAUGH)

45:17.507 --> 45:20.884
Lfyou're going to the ceremony,
I thought we might walk together.

45:20.968 --> 45:22.844
Certainly, I'm going.

45:23.721 --> 45:27.140
I want to see the old bat's face
when they announce it.

45:27.225 --> 45:29.851
I must try not to look too cheerful.

45:30.061 --> 45:33.438
Or shouldn't I talk like that in your presence?

45:34.148 --> 45:37.317
Do you find me very ridiculous, Mrs Hughes?

45:37.777 --> 45:40.821
Putting on airs and graces I've no right to?

45:41.447 --> 45:42.906
What's brought this on?

45:42.990 --> 45:45.075
(SIGHS) Nothing.

45:46.911 --> 45:50.997
Except at times I wonder
if I'm just a sad old fool.

by being part of it.

to walk with me down to...

Well, I think everyone is.

Sorry, what were you saying?

Nothing. Doesn't matter.

46:22.155 --> 46:25.782
Put this away before you go,
and never mind your flirting.

46:25.867 --> 46:28.201
I wasn't flirting. Not with him.

46:28.327 --> 46:30.120
William's not a bad lad.

46:30.204 --> 46:33.206
He's nice enough. But he isn't like Thomas.

46:33.541 --> 46:35.709
No. He's not.

46:38.629 --> 46:40.297
Cuff links, sir?

46:40.673 --> 46:44.676
Those are a dull option for such an occasion.
Don't you agree?

46:46.554 --> 46:49.306
Might I suggest the crested pair, sir?

46:49.390 --> 46:52.225
They seem more appropriate,
ifyou don't mind my saying.

46:53.686 --> 46:54.811
Hmm.

46:56.564 --> 46:59.983
They're a bit fiddly.
I wonder ifyou could help me.

47:00.067 --> 47:01.651
Certainly, sir.
