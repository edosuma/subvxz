WEBVTT

00:10.093 --> 00:11.428
[gasps]

00:11.511 --> 00:14.764
I can't believe what I'm looking at.
These zombies have gone full Romero.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.558
[snapping fingers]

00:17.767 --> 00:19.644
They are just standing there
like trained dogs.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.021
-I don't see how.
-[footsteps approaching]

00:22.105 --> 00:23.773
[whispering] Neither do I,
but we have to get out of here.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.442
Right, agreed. How?

00:29.654 --> 00:31.448
Nope. Nope, nope.

00:31.531 --> 00:32.907
Do you have any better ideas?

00:33.992 --> 00:36.536
-[both breathing heavily]
-[footsteps approaching]

00:36.619 --> 00:40.415
[Martin] Well, is this a minor thing
or is this a problem?

00:41.041 --> 00:42.792
-[thunder rumbling]
-Everything's ready.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.336
I don't need last-minute issues.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.629
A minor thing.

00:46.713 --> 00:50.008
Our zombie senator tells us
they are beta testing

00:50.091 --> 00:53.261
a TSA infrared system at Vegas airport.

00:53.344 --> 00:56.431
He can take it offline
by ordering diagnostic tests,

00:56.514 --> 00:59.017
but he needs to know by 5:00 on Friday.

00:59.100 --> 01:04.147
You will need to send him a go-code
as soon as they are in position.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.690
[sighs] I see.

01:05.774 --> 01:09.861
Well, I'll make sure they're aware
they have a very limited window.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.071
Wait a minute.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.118
Someone's been in here.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.499
Some of the samples are missing.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.590
[metal squeaking]

01:31.674 --> 01:33.635
[sighs] Call Spud.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.095
We need to get out of here immediately.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.597
Now!

01:42.852 --> 01:44.604
[theme music playing]

01:50.110 --> 01:51.111
[Mike] So,

01:51.778 --> 01:55.406
then it's Congress joke, Bieber joke,
and then into "Willkommen."

01:55.490 --> 01:58.118
Just don't forget to give me
that look on "stranger."

01:58.201 --> 02:00.078
-I know the cues, Gary.
-[Gary scoffs]

02:00.161 --> 02:01.746
That's what you said last time.

02:01.913 --> 02:03.373
Right before you missed the cue.

02:04.624 --> 02:07.127
Oh, damn it, I'm out of nails.

02:07.919 --> 02:10.130
-I got to run to Darla's.
-[Mike vocalizing]

02:13.508 --> 02:14.676
Don't be late.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.262
I don't miss cues.

02:21.349 --> 02:24.018
Okay. Five minutes, ladies. So...

02:24.102 --> 02:26.521
Sorry, Darla's was crowded and I had to...

02:29.232 --> 02:30.316
Oh, my God.

02:31.860 --> 02:32.861
Oh!

02:34.445 --> 02:36.197
After all this time,

02:37.198 --> 02:41.244
the original batch of Boat Party Utopium.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.412
[Ravi sighs]

02:43.163 --> 02:46.207
Now I know how Sir Galahad felt
when he at last held the Holy Grail.

02:46.708 --> 02:47.959
The Holy Grail?

02:48.251 --> 02:49.711
So, who would that make my father?

02:49.794 --> 02:50.795
Mordred?

02:52.463 --> 02:55.717
Sorry he turned out to be
such an irredeemable evil bastard.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.261
At least he kept good records.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.762
A silver lining, I guess.

03:02.181 --> 03:03.182
[Ravi] Right.

03:03.266 --> 03:08.229
I get this to Charli at the CDC.
She can analyze it, reproduce it,

03:08.313 --> 03:11.900
and we are one big step
closer to the cure.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.944
Which, uh, can't come soon enough.

03:16.070 --> 03:19.574
Another Freylich kid was listed missing
two days ago in Ohio.

03:20.783 --> 03:22.493
That makes five, by my count.

03:22.577 --> 03:26.372
Ravi, for the 600th time,
this isn't your fault.

03:27.665 --> 03:31.794
So, Michael Stansfield here's given us

03:31.878 --> 03:33.838
quite a glamorous crime scene.

03:33.922 --> 03:38.134
Evidence at the scene
includes rhinestones off a sheath dress,

03:38.218 --> 03:40.261
feathers, various wigs,

03:40.345 --> 03:43.765
and a six-foot string of pearls
assumed to be the murder weapon.

03:43.848 --> 03:45.308
You assume correctly.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.185
[Clive] Huh, what's the saying?

03:47.268 --> 03:50.230
"Live fast, die young,
leave a beautiful corpse"?

03:50.772 --> 03:52.732
You know, you got the last part, anyway.

03:52.815 --> 03:56.694
So, are you ready to be fabulous?

03:58.905 --> 04:00.490
[whistling]

04:07.163 --> 04:08.498
[timer dings]

04:13.419 --> 04:16.005
So, we've got Howard Denning in a cage.

04:16.089 --> 04:20.468
Manager at Prince Mary's
and ex-husband of the deceased.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.264
I know it's the brain,
but I just have to say.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.932
This is a bold choice.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.558
Well, look around, Clive.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.602
This place is utterly gray.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.729
Not a nice
Kim-Novak's-suit-in<i>-Vertigo</i> gray,

04:31.813 --> 04:34.107
I mean a lifeless greenish gray.

04:34.190 --> 04:35.692
We work inside a dead frog.

04:35.775 --> 04:40.154
I expected a thanks for bringing
some color to this wasteland, but...

04:40.238 --> 04:41.322
Well, thanks.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.324
As long as we keep it professional.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.785
Clive, when have I ever been
anything but professional?

04:45.910 --> 04:48.162
-[stammering] Well...
-Who's this sob-sister?

04:50.707 --> 04:52.083
Howard Denning.

04:52.166 --> 04:55.628
Manager at Prince Mary's,
ex-husband of the deceased?

04:57.130 --> 04:58.923
Oh. Great.

05:08.599 --> 05:09.600
Lovely outfit.

05:09.684 --> 05:12.312
It really pops against these green walls.

05:15.606 --> 05:18.401
We just want to ask you
some questions, Mr. Denning.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.320
Did you notice
anything unusual that night?

05:21.195 --> 05:23.948
It was a Tuesday,
Mike and Gary's usual night.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.074
Usual crowd.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.492
Gary being Mike's drag partner?

05:27.076 --> 05:29.245
They bought the club together
20 years ago.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.831
But Gary was with me when I found
the body, so I don't think...

05:31.914 --> 05:35.209
Maybe leave the detective stuff to us,
Miss Marple.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.169
Go back.

05:36.919 --> 05:39.589
So, if Gary and Mike
bought the bar together,

05:39.672 --> 05:41.424
how come it's all going to you?

05:42.508 --> 05:44.969
Gary had money issues over the years.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.679
He sold his stake to Mike.

05:46.763 --> 05:50.683
Does Prince Mary's have any kind
of security system? Cameras or...

05:50.767 --> 05:52.852
We got one. Over the front door.

05:52.935 --> 05:54.562
But, I mean, what's to steal? The wigs?

05:54.645 --> 05:56.189
Any other entrances?

05:56.272 --> 05:59.025
There's a fire door in the back,
but it only opens from the inside.

05:59.108 --> 06:02.028
Were you aware of anyone
who might've wanted Mike dead?

06:03.112 --> 06:04.113
Not that I'm aware of.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.490
[Liv] Oh, come on.

06:05.573 --> 06:08.076
You're telling me
you had a bunch of drag queens

06:08.159 --> 06:10.787
squished into this tiny bar
for years and years,

06:10.870 --> 06:13.206
and no one wanted to murder anyone?

06:13.289 --> 06:15.124
Well, I'm happy managing the place.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.543
But if you wanna know gossip,

06:18.753 --> 06:20.129
ask Gary.

06:21.631 --> 06:22.840
He didn't do it.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.050
I agree.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.426
Classic milquetoast husband.

06:25.510 --> 06:29.138
Probably collects commemorative plates.
Murder takes balls.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.640
And he has multiple alibis.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.601
I'll get Jenkins to review
the security camera footage,

06:33.684 --> 06:35.478
see if there's anything useful.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.105
You done in there?

06:37.188 --> 06:38.815
Well done, with a side of fries.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.191
[sighs]

06:41.234 --> 06:43.402
Miss, go on in, take a seat.

06:45.613 --> 06:49.200
That is one tall glass of iced nasty.
Who is it?

06:49.283 --> 06:53.079
Oh, some rich old zombie
with a human girl on the side

06:53.162 --> 06:55.081
got busted and shot by his wife.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.458
That's the girl on the side.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.710
A zombie with a human girlfriend?

06:59.794 --> 07:00.920
I should say former zombie.

07:01.003 --> 07:03.548
I guess he got cured
right before he got whacked.

07:03.631 --> 07:04.882
Talk about irony.

07:08.594 --> 07:12.682
Ravi, drop whatever you're doing
and get up to Interrogation.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.186
So, you were a waitress at Odium?

07:18.104 --> 07:19.772
I'm a bar hostess.

07:19.856 --> 07:23.234
And this is where you met Edward
two months ago?

07:23.317 --> 07:24.485
[Clarissa] Yes.

07:25.695 --> 07:26.904
Nice look.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.366
Bit more reserved
than I was expecting, frankly.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.119
Like I would be interested in the input
from someone whose style

07:33.202 --> 07:36.706
would best be described
as "British boy's school CPR mannequin."

07:37.498 --> 07:39.792
And a bit more shade out of the gate
than I was expecting.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.502
-What's this?
-You'll see.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.089
[S. Cavanaugh]
So, older guys are your thing, or...

07:45.840 --> 07:49.093
No, but they do tend to have
all the money, so...

07:49.177 --> 07:50.261
I make do.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.889
[S. Cavanaugh]
And he was a zombie when you met?

07:54.974 --> 07:56.184
When did he turn human?

07:57.059 --> 07:58.227
[Clarissa] Yesterday.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.230
A few hours before his wife killed him.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.815
"Turned human"?

08:03.441 --> 08:05.568
[Blaine] Edward Franzen's dead? Seriously?

08:05.651 --> 08:07.987
Guess the wife caught him
doing it with his human mistress,

08:08.070 --> 08:10.031
right after he ate the Freylich brain.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.240
One shot, right through the heart.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.118
And Annie Oakley couldn't wait
to kill him after close of business, huh?

08:16.037 --> 08:18.623
[Marty] <i>DeBeers!</i>
<i>How's the weather in Seattle?</i>

08:18.706 --> 08:20.958
<i>It's another sunny day</i>
<i>in my tax-sheltered island paradise.</i>

08:21.042 --> 08:22.418
Yeah, I'm looking at cloudy

08:22.502 --> 08:25.171
with a chance
of financial debacle here, Marty.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.965
Did Franzen's wire transfer go through
the shell corporation?

08:28.049 --> 08:29.425
<i>Let me take a look-see.</i>

08:30.051 --> 08:30.885
<i>Huh.</i>

08:30.968 --> 08:33.888
<i>Looks like funds were coming through</i>
<i>a shell via a family trust,</i>

08:33.971 --> 08:35.515
<i>now linked to a capital crime case.</i>

08:35.598 --> 08:37.850
<i>In layman's terms, the payment's frozen...</i>

08:38.142 --> 08:39.435
[sighs]

08:39.519 --> 08:40.937
Hey, do...

08:41.020 --> 08:42.230
Do you remember

08:42.313 --> 08:46.317
the name of the bagpiper we hired
when we tried Scotch and soda night?

08:46.400 --> 08:47.318
No.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.529
Darcy wants bagpipes at the wedding.

08:49.612 --> 08:53.324
No, but I could strangle a duck
for half of his price.

08:55.117 --> 08:56.244
Get down.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.246
[clattering]

08:58.329 --> 08:59.872
Blaine, do you remember when...

08:59.956 --> 09:01.082
Hey, babe!

09:01.165 --> 09:03.417
-[gasps]
-What?

09:03.501 --> 09:05.503
Well, you're not supposed to see me
in my dress.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.171
It's bad luck!

09:07.255 --> 09:08.422
It is.

09:08.506 --> 09:09.882
You said you weren't gonna be here.

09:09.966 --> 09:12.677
Come on, it's not bad luck.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.263
It's just an old wives' saying.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.391
Who doesn't love a wedding?

09:19.141 --> 09:21.227
Go see if you can
line me up some more buyers.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.732
Did anybody wanna murder Mike?

09:27.692 --> 09:30.736
Please. A bunch of drag bitches
packed into a tiny bar?

09:30.820 --> 09:32.488
Somebody wanted to murder someone
every night.

09:34.323 --> 09:35.866
Oh, but it wasn't me.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.994
I was out buying nails and I got receipts.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.662
We've seen them.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.623
So, Gary, you and Mr. Stansfield
were partners?

09:42.707 --> 09:44.166
For over 20 years.

09:44.667 --> 09:45.835
[Gary inhales sharply]

09:45.918 --> 09:50.548
We both fled uptight Midwest childhoods,
were way into drag.

09:50.631 --> 09:51.924
We were even the same dress size.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.634
We've done everyone.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.386
Jane and Marilyn.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.513
Jackie O and Pat Nixon.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.681
Cher and Charo.

09:58.764 --> 09:59.890
Drag Charo?

10:00.016 --> 10:02.101
[scoffs] Kind of a hat on a hat,
don't you think?

10:02.184 --> 10:06.689
You're not wrong,
but Mike's Cher was excellent.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.024
You bought the bar together?

10:08.107 --> 10:09.108
Yes.

10:09.692 --> 10:13.070
Just a grimy little box
in a crap neighborhood.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.281
But it was our little paradise, you know?

10:15.364 --> 10:17.783
But you sold
your share of paradise to Mike.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.368
That didn't bother you?

10:19.452 --> 10:22.955
Oh, I don't care who owns the bar,
as long as it's there, you know?

10:23.039 --> 10:25.833
But it wasn't a great business move.

10:25.916 --> 10:28.210
Business now is fabulous, pun intended.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.964
Drag isn't some weird, dark secret
anymore. It's out.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.716
It's on TV, the kids love it.

10:36.927 --> 10:40.056
Speaking of which,
have you spoken to Bitchkraft?

10:41.432 --> 10:42.850
Bitchkraft?

10:42.933 --> 10:44.018
Is that a person?

10:44.101 --> 10:45.603
One of the new zombie kids.

10:45.686 --> 10:49.190
A stone nasty skinny bitch,
and I do not mean that as a compliment.

10:49.273 --> 10:52.693
-[shudders]
-All flash, no act, no character, no wit.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.153
I just don't get it. We...

10:54.779 --> 10:57.865
We needed to have a sense
of connection to the past.

10:57.948 --> 11:00.159
You know? How you got here.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.036
But you know these kids today... Oof!

11:02.119 --> 11:03.996
Yes, I'm sure. But why him?

11:04.080 --> 11:07.833
Well, see, she fancies herself a star now.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.168
Hates the way we run the place.

11:09.251 --> 11:11.504
Thinks we're old has-beens.

11:11.587 --> 11:14.090
She sent her promoter
to pressure Mike to sell.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.175
We refused, of course.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.885
But I could swear

11:17.968 --> 11:21.097
I saw that nasty, trash wig of hers
in the audience that night.

11:21.180 --> 11:24.266
How do we find this delightful-sounding
young person?

11:24.350 --> 11:27.853
I don't even know her real name,
but she's on tonight,

11:27.937 --> 11:31.315
if you care to witness the depths
to which the culture has fallen.

11:35.903 --> 11:38.823
-Thanks, Cavanaugh. I owe you. Bye.
-[door opens]

11:41.367 --> 11:42.368
[door closes]

11:44.829 --> 11:47.540
Tetsuo Sushi? What's the occasion?

11:47.623 --> 11:50.084
I knew how much you'd like to come home,

11:50.167 --> 11:51.544
after a hard day
at the paramilitary office,

11:51.627 --> 11:52.878
to find some brain rolls waiting for you.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.088
-Ravi.
-Mmm.

11:54.171 --> 11:55.214
Oh, okay.

11:55.297 --> 11:56.424
-I love you.
-Hmm.

11:59.176 --> 12:00.261
-[clears throat]
-Wait.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.514
Toro rolls and wagyu?

12:05.307 --> 12:06.559
You need a favor.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.269
[stammering] Just...

12:08.352 --> 12:11.939
There's a thing that I thought,
you know, we could do together.

12:12.022 --> 12:14.316
Might be a fun change of pace
for both of us.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.443
What, like bowling?

12:15.526 --> 12:16.610
Yeah, no.

12:16.694 --> 12:20.531
More of a locate-some-kidnapped-teens
kinda thing.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.200
It's the missing Freylich kids.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.369
I found someone
who might lead us to someone

12:25.453 --> 12:28.622
who just might know where they might be,
if we're lucky.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.332
Sounds rock-solid.

12:33.043 --> 12:34.211
Clarissa Bates.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.505
Human girlfriend
of rich zombie Edward Franzen,

12:36.589 --> 12:38.174
bought a Freylich brain, turned human.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.384
Then got murdered
by his jealous zombie wife.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.845
You don't think the rich guy
found the dealer?

12:42.928 --> 12:46.307
Wife described him as a shy finance geek
who couldn't catch a cab,

12:46.390 --> 12:48.434
much less navigate
the illicit brain trade.

12:48.517 --> 12:50.102
But Ms. Bates here...

12:52.646 --> 12:53.689
[Major] Okay.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.066
So, where do I fit in?

12:56.150 --> 12:58.110
One thing that was clear
is that Clarissa Bates

12:58.194 --> 12:59.987
is desperate to get out of Seattle,

13:00.070 --> 13:02.781
and she's tired
of dating old sugar daddies.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.200
[Ravi inhales deeply]

13:04.283 --> 13:06.076
So, I figured,

13:06.160 --> 13:10.998
a dashing specimen, such as yourself,
might, you know...

13:11.081 --> 13:12.333
That's what this is about?

13:13.417 --> 13:15.711
You want me to be
some kind of gigolo bait?

13:15.878 --> 13:17.713
Oh, oh, I was thinking spy.

13:17.796 --> 13:20.591
It sounds cooler and less dirty.

13:22.801 --> 13:23.928
Okay.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.930
Let's get weird.

13:26.722 --> 13:28.098
Is that a yes?

13:35.189 --> 13:36.524
[Liv] Okay,

13:36.607 --> 13:38.108
who's seen my faux mink?

13:38.526 --> 13:40.736
I'm going clubbing tonight, and I need...

13:42.488 --> 13:44.198
What's with the Andrews Sisters?

13:44.281 --> 13:46.158
The Dillon Sisters.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.285
Riley and I told you about them last week?

13:48.369 --> 13:50.287
Mom needs a bone marrow transplant.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.873
We agreed to smuggle them out?

13:52.957 --> 13:54.124
Oh, right.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.251
The mom's in bad shape.

13:56.627 --> 13:57.545
Okay.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.963
Let's get moving.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.093
Graham.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.928
You're not telling me something.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.597
What? What do you mean?

14:10.766 --> 14:11.850
The coat.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.728
Waist-length, faux mink. Have you seen it?

14:14.812 --> 14:15.896
Oh, uh...

14:16.313 --> 14:17.439
Bedroom closet?

14:21.360 --> 14:22.403
[exhales]

14:32.454 --> 14:35.916
Look, [sighs] is getting murdered sad?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.209
I guess.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.961
But I wasn't even there.

14:39.086 --> 14:42.464
So, I don't see
why you don't just go away.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.175
According to Gary Schaeffer,
you were, Bitchkraft.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.928
Hmm, I have better things to do
than watch a couple old queens

14:48.012 --> 14:49.805
make dad jokes and sing show tunes.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.974
Bitch needs to have her eyes checked.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.058
As should you.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.603
Those lashes look like drowned spiders.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.606
So, what better things
were you up to that night?

14:58.689 --> 15:00.107
Watching <i>Housewives.</i> At home.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.442
Can anyone confirm that?

15:01.525 --> 15:03.444
Mmm... My cats.

15:03.527 --> 15:06.572
Did you or anyone ever try to buy
Prince Mary's from Mike?

15:06.655 --> 15:09.283
Yes, my promoter, Tony,
made them an offer.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.201
Why they turned it down
is a mystery to me.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.704
I mean, I absolutely slay
every single night at this place.

15:13.787 --> 15:15.247
I could've doubled their business
in one week,

15:15.331 --> 15:17.541
but, you know, they're so stuck
in the past

15:17.625 --> 15:20.544
with their whole old-school drag thing
that no one cares about.

15:20.628 --> 15:21.754
[sighs]

15:21.837 --> 15:24.214
I mean, who even is Jane Russell?

15:24.298 --> 15:27.760
A bodacious icon of golden age Hollywood.
Next question.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.219
Ugh! Whatever.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.471
-[Liv sighs]
-See?

15:30.554 --> 15:32.056
That's how time works.

15:32.139 --> 15:34.183
The old thing fades away,

15:34.266 --> 15:35.893
and the new thing takes over.

15:38.646 --> 15:39.772
[sighs]

15:41.398 --> 15:44.485
And, honey, I'm the new thing.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.322
-[rock music playing]
-[crowd cheering]

16:00.292 --> 16:01.335
See?

16:01.418 --> 16:03.796
These kids love her.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.383
And, yeah, we put a bid on the place.

16:07.466 --> 16:08.384
A good bid.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.927
They turned us down flat.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.345
Any idea why?

16:12.262 --> 16:13.597
Personal drama.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.766
Which, as a businessman, pisses me off.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.435
So, I figured it was a long shot.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.980
The way the neighborhood's changed,
everyone wants this property.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.524
Commercial, real estate,
corporate big boys.

16:23.649 --> 16:24.775
It's tough.

16:26.276 --> 16:28.278
[cheering continues]

16:29.655 --> 16:34.034
[announcer] Let's hear it once again,
Prince Mary, for Bitchkraft!

16:38.497 --> 16:40.666
Oh, bless you, Howard. I need this.

16:41.667 --> 16:42.668
Ah!

16:42.751 --> 16:44.545
So, what'd you think?

16:44.628 --> 16:46.797
Yeah, I mean, it seemed lively?

16:46.880 --> 16:48.424
Are you insane?

16:48.507 --> 16:50.050
It's just cheap sensationalism.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.218
What the kids want.

16:51.301 --> 16:52.386
-Emptier, the better.
-[sighs]

16:52.469 --> 16:53.846
I mean, look at that.

16:53.929 --> 16:57.182
Every time she performs,
poor Carlo has to sweep the damn stage

16:57.266 --> 17:00.269
for all the glitter and rhinestones
that fall off those cheap-ass looks.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.357
Give me an evidence bag.

17:07.818 --> 17:08.986
Wait here.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.287
[Liv] <i>Just as I thought. Look.</i>

17:18.871 --> 17:20.372
[Clive] Okay, what am I looking at?

17:20.456 --> 17:21.790
[Liv] Workmanship, Clive.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.250
You see those little holes on the back?

17:23.333 --> 17:25.294
Hand-sewn rhinestone,

17:25.586 --> 17:28.130
from the gown Mike was wearing
the night he died.

17:29.631 --> 17:30.758
Drag is work.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.259
Mike put in the work.

17:32.342 --> 17:33.594
Now,

17:33.677 --> 17:34.970
look at these.

17:37.681 --> 17:39.099
Glue-on.

17:39.767 --> 17:40.934
This is from the crime scene?

17:41.018 --> 17:43.896
Correct. Not from Mike's dress,
which wouldn't fall off.

17:43.979 --> 17:45.397
And this...

17:46.982 --> 17:49.943
is from the crap
that fell off Bitchkraft's skirt,

17:50.027 --> 17:51.111
also...

17:51.195 --> 17:53.155
Glued-on rhinestones.

17:53.947 --> 17:56.325
I say we find Bitchkraft and bring him in.

18:06.502 --> 18:07.711
Sorry.

18:07.795 --> 18:08.921
Have you been helped?

18:10.047 --> 18:12.424
I saw that it was kind of slow
and I just sat myself.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.136
[sighs] I needed this.

18:18.305 --> 18:19.723
Rough day at work, Commander?

18:19.807 --> 18:20.933
[chuckles]

18:21.767 --> 18:23.268
I have a TV.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.521
I've seen
the head of Fillmore Graves before.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.356
They're all rough days.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.193
I could use some company.

18:33.654 --> 18:37.908
You have no idea
what a drag Fillmore Graves is.

18:37.991 --> 18:40.911
Day in, day out, one thing after another.

18:40.994 --> 18:43.205
And it never gets better.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.624
And the hat. Ugh.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.000
[chuckles softly]

18:48.377 --> 18:49.920
I mean,

18:50.045 --> 18:52.297
the temptation is always there.

18:52.381 --> 18:56.885
I can get myself out of the city
if I wanted to, but...

18:56.969 --> 18:58.554
You'd still be a zombie.

18:59.847 --> 19:02.099
Yeah. I mean, nothing against zombies.

19:02.474 --> 19:03.934
I just miss being alive.

19:04.685 --> 19:08.438
There is a lot of stuff
that I really miss the taste of.

19:09.189 --> 19:10.232
You know...

19:12.442 --> 19:15.904
I might know someone
who might have access to a cure.

19:17.030 --> 19:19.199
But it's expensive.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.410
Like, really expensive.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.579
That's not a problem.

19:24.204 --> 19:26.331
I'd have to meet with the guy to check.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.712
There's just one catch.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.506
You'd have to take me with you.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.092
Hardly seems like a catch.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.313
My number's on the back.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.192
[Major] So, she met with her guy.

19:54.109 --> 19:57.279
Honestly, it creeps me out
that you can now fit a tracking device

19:57.362 --> 19:58.405
inside a business card.

19:58.488 --> 20:01.575
Yeah. Best thing about being
the head of a private mercenary force?

20:01.658 --> 20:02.826
The toys.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.411
I don't know...

20:04.494 --> 20:07.247
This little trip into south Seattle
kinda sticks out to me.

20:07.331 --> 20:10.250
Right. So, what now?

20:11.460 --> 20:12.461
Recon?

20:13.962 --> 20:16.340
That... That is the word, recon. Right?

20:16.423 --> 20:18.675
Recon is indeed the word.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.177
[mimics gunshots]

20:20.260 --> 20:21.303
You were right.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.263
This is a nice change of pace.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.807
-Right?
-Let's go save some kids.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.192
Eat up, Stephen.

20:37.277 --> 20:38.403
Quietly.

20:41.156 --> 20:42.532
[Enzo clears throat]

20:42.699 --> 20:43.784
[Martin] Good news.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.621
Riley and her team have made it out,
and they're on the train.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.582
They should reach Vegas by tomorrow.

20:50.666 --> 20:51.750
Excellent.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.002
Now Graham has done his job,

20:54.086 --> 20:57.673
we can finally be rid
of this tiresome boyfriend of his.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.007
Looks that way.

20:59.508 --> 21:02.261
Have Spud drive him somewhere remote

21:02.344 --> 21:04.137
and then cut him loose.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.514
Like, release him?

21:05.597 --> 21:07.599
Sure. He doesn't know anything
they don't already know--

21:07.683 --> 21:10.477
Sir, excuse me, but I'm afraid
you are losing your nerve.

21:11.019 --> 21:14.648
You've already put this operation at risk
by letting your daughter stay alive,

21:14.731 --> 21:18.819
and now you want to compound that risk
by releasing the hostage.

21:18.902 --> 21:19.945
I'm worried.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.239
It was your daughter
who has influenced you,

21:22.322 --> 21:23.865
and not the other way around.

21:27.494 --> 21:28.578
Fine.

21:29.413 --> 21:30.956
Do what you feel is necessary.

21:33.583 --> 21:34.793
Thank you, sir.

21:37.045 --> 21:38.505
[men chattering indistinctly]

21:42.592 --> 21:45.679
Okay, you got me. Yeah, I used glue
on rhinestones. Is that a crime?

21:45.762 --> 21:46.888
Yes.

21:47.431 --> 21:50.058
Or, no... In a legal sense.

21:50.475 --> 21:53.270
Any idea how these could've ended up
in Mike's dressing room?

21:53.353 --> 21:55.689
-His were sewn on.
-[scoffs] How pointless.

21:55.772 --> 21:57.733
[inhales deeply] Yeah, I don't know.

21:57.816 --> 22:00.360
But you admit you were there
the night Mike was killed?

22:00.944 --> 22:02.529
Because you do appear

22:03.530 --> 22:05.699
on the security camera footage.

22:05.782 --> 22:07.242
[scoffs] Oh, come on.

22:07.701 --> 22:09.995
That's not me.
That's clearly one of the Hags.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.206
-The Hags?
-Yeah. My followers.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.792
They're legion.
They have a whole Instagram page.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.002
I mean,

22:17.085 --> 22:19.087
the wig and stuff's pretty good,
but come on,

22:19.171 --> 22:20.464
look at his legs.

22:21.506 --> 22:22.966
I'm a willowy bitch, mmm,

22:23.050 --> 22:24.468
this poor boy's got cankles.

22:24.551 --> 22:27.888

I saw the killer. I mean, a wig.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.323
It fell off during the murder.

22:46.406 --> 22:47.532
What kind of wig?

22:47.616 --> 22:50.160
Long, black, lustrous.

22:51.828 --> 22:53.080

when I was going through them all,
coming in and coming out,

23:32.869 --> 23:35.330
there was one Cher that came in
but didn't come out.

23:35.413 --> 23:36.581
Well, why didn't you say so?

23:36.665 --> 23:37.833
I just did.

23:41.461 --> 23:43.380
We know someone with a Cher outfit.

23:45.298 --> 23:47.801
I wonder if it's an '80s dress
with sparkles?

23:47.884 --> 23:50.345
'70s gown with sequins,
but right idea.

23:50.679 --> 23:51.680

24:46.610 --> 24:47.903
Well, why can't I do recon?

24:48.862 --> 24:51.823
Because I'm a trained mercenary soldier,
and you're a medical examiner.

24:52.282 --> 24:53.700
I only have one of these.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.412

24:57.495 --> 24:58.580
There's no cars.

24:58.663 --> 25:00.373
What if they hid them? Like we did?

25:00.457 --> 25:01.833
Or took public transportation? Or--

25:01.917 --> 25:02.918
I did show you this, right?

You're the lookout. Just...

the night Mike died.

weren't Mike's and weren't hers.

how did they get there?

29:08.288 --> 29:09.914
Well, let me tell you what I think.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.877
I think you left the dressing room
that night with Mike's Cher outfit.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.296
You put it on, returned in drag,

29:16.379 --> 29:19.007
killed Mike, and went out the fire door.

29:20.383 --> 29:23.386
And then you got your nails,
and your receipt, and your alibi.

Come on, there's Chers all over
the place around here, all the time.

Mike was Cher, you were Charo?

29:34.647 --> 29:36.232
You two were the same size, right?

29:36.316 --> 29:38.610
Yes, but that's absurd.

29:39.944 --> 29:42.947
-Why?
-See, that was my question. Why?

29:43.031 --> 29:45.158
So we called around
some of the big real estate places.

29:45.533 --> 29:48.912

the bar to a developer

29:48.995 --> 29:50.288

I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

36:41.741 --> 36:43.659
Because I didn't tell you.

36:45.953 --> 36:46.996
I couldn't.

36:47.914 --> 36:48.998
Why couldn't you?

36:49.081 --> 36:50.333
Because...

36:51.626 --> 36:54.253
They took him, and they said that...

36:55.588 --> 36:57.298
If I didn't do what they asked,

36:57.381 --> 36:58.549
they would kill him.

36:58.633 --> 36:59.634
And I did it.

37:00.426 --> 37:01.928
And they killed him anyway.

37:02.011 --> 37:03.387
What did you do?

37:03.471 --> 37:05.640
Graham? You need to tell me right now.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.308
[shudders]

37:08.601 --> 37:10.394
I brought Riley into the hub.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.730
-She was one of them, and--
-Who's them?

37:12.813 --> 37:16.317
I don't know.
Some kind of zombie extremist group.

37:16.984 --> 37:18.152
I just saw them once,

37:18.236 --> 37:21.781
this middle-aged guy, and a French guy
in a blue van, and they...

37:22.198 --> 37:23.282
Oh, Liv...

37:23.366 --> 37:27.203
Those women... Those women
who went out with Riley.

37:27.286 --> 37:28.496
The, the... They...

37:28.579 --> 37:29.747
They weren't sisters.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.333
They were zombies.

37:32.416 --> 37:34.752
What were they doing?
Where were they going?

37:34.835 --> 37:37.505
I don't know. Vegas, I think.

37:39.465 --> 37:41.133
That was supposed to be the end of it.

37:41.217 --> 37:43.135
[sobbing] But they killed him anyway.

37:49.976 --> 37:51.185
[computer chimes]

37:57.483 --> 37:59.402
[video chat chiming]

38:08.452 --> 38:10.162
[sighs] Hello, Liv.

38:10.246 --> 38:12.873
<i>Martin, what are you doing?</i>

38:14.417 --> 38:17.795
Liv, it's my hope that one day,

38:18.504 --> 38:21.757
we can talk this all over
in different circumstances,

38:21.841 --> 38:22.925
<i>and I can explain--</i>

38:23.009 --> 38:24.969
Don't. I know about Riley.

38:25.261 --> 38:26.554
What's she doing in Vegas?

38:27.054 --> 38:29.181
<i>We're bringing the fight to the enemy.</i>

38:29.265 --> 38:31.600
<i>National Electronics Convention.</i>

38:31.976 --> 38:34.979
<i>Riley's team takes over a brothel,</i>
<i>infects conventioneers,</i>

38:35.062 --> 38:37.189
<i>who bring it home, and bingo.</i>

38:37.273 --> 38:40.109
<i>Zombies are everywhere,</i>
<i>where we're meant to be,</i>

38:41.068 --> 38:42.862
<i>and a new order begins.</i>

38:42.945 --> 38:44.572
Martin, that... That's crazy.

38:44.655 --> 38:45.865
It only seems that way

38:45.948 --> 38:47.950
because you're not looking at it
from the right perspective.

38:48.034 --> 38:51.203
<i>From my perspective,</i>
<i>it looks like mass murder.</i>

38:51.287 --> 38:52.371
I understand.

38:53.581 --> 38:56.625
You're a good person,
and you suffer when others do.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.336
It's not like I don't feel things.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.880
But I know what's necessary,

39:01.088 --> 39:02.214
and I do it.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.800
And that's something
that I've seen in you.

39:04.884 --> 39:09.138
<i>It's not necessary. You know that.</i>
<i>You've seen it, staying with me,</i>

39:09.221 --> 39:10.431
we can all get along.

39:10.514 --> 39:11.932
<i>They think we're monsters.</i>

39:12.475 --> 39:15.227
<i>If you don't see how that plays out,</i>
<i>you're just being naive.</i>

39:15.311 --> 39:19.607
[sobbing] I'm not naive.
I know that it's not easy. It takes work.

39:20.649 --> 39:22.902
But, yeah, it's necessary, so I do it.

39:24.278 --> 39:25.363
<i>Dad...</i>

39:26.447 --> 39:27.698
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

39:28.574 --> 39:29.825
<i>-Don't do this.</i>
-[sighs]

39:29.909 --> 39:32.078
<i>I know you're not this person.</i>

39:32.661 --> 39:34.121
And how do you know that?

39:34.205 --> 39:35.414
Because I'm your daughter

39:35.498 --> 39:39.251
and I would never have any part
of something like this.

39:39.335 --> 39:40.378
<i>Liv.</i>

39:41.879 --> 39:44.340
<i>-Just give it time.</i>
-Never. [sobs]

39:46.634 --> 39:48.969
Sir, the Senator is calling again.

39:49.053 --> 39:53.224
If we want the airport infrared down,
we need to let him know, now.

39:53.849 --> 39:56.227
It's almost 5:00 his time.

39:56.310 --> 39:58.437
Are the girls in position?

39:58.521 --> 39:59.730
In a moment, Enzo.

40:00.523 --> 40:02.650
<i>The people who hate us? They're wrong.</i>

40:04.276 --> 40:06.695
<i>We're not monsters,</i>
<i>so don't make them right.</i>

40:06.779 --> 40:08.280
Sir, what are you doing?

40:08.364 --> 40:11.158
We have to let the Senator know.
If the system is not down,

40:11.242 --> 40:12.410
<i>the plan will fail.</i>

40:12.493 --> 40:14.578
Are the girls in position?

40:15.830 --> 40:17.081
What do I tell him?

40:20.709 --> 40:21.919
[gun cocks]

40:22.253 --> 40:23.254
Sir!

40:24.088 --> 40:27.466
I demand you tell me
if we are going or not.

40:27.550 --> 40:28.801
<i>It's 5:00, sir.</i>

40:28.884 --> 40:30.010
<i>Tell me now, or--</i>

40:30.094 --> 40:31.387
Or what, Enzo?

40:32.555 --> 40:33.597
Damn you.

40:35.724 --> 40:36.767
[Liv gasps]

40:46.110 --> 40:47.236
[sighs]

40:47.319 --> 40:48.446
Enzo.

40:51.031 --> 40:53.742
No struggle begins or ends
with a single move.

40:53.826 --> 40:55.369
If this doesn't go,

40:55.911 --> 40:56.996
we regroup and...

40:57.663 --> 40:58.706
[groans]

41:02.960 --> 41:04.253
[Liv] <i>No!</i>
