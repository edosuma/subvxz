00:38.414 --> 00:39.872
Play ball!

00:42.251 --> 00:43.876
I got it! I got it!

00:49.800 --> 00:51.092
Here we go!

00:51.176 --> 00:52.635
Strike!

01:12.656 --> 01:15.992
Oh, come on.
Why do I always get stuck with the loser?

01:16.076 --> 01:17.785
He stinks.
Darn it!

01:17.870 --> 01:19.245
Too bad.
Hustle! Hustle!

01:19.329 --> 01:21.581
- Yankee Irving again!
- Tough luck.

01:21.665 --> 01:24.167
Why do we always end up
with Yankee?

01:27.421 --> 01:29.213
Excuse me.

01:30.966 --> 01:32.091
I got it!

01:32.176 --> 01:33.259
Whoa!

01:33.343 --> 01:36.596
You show them, Warbuckles!
Way to run it out!

01:38.599 --> 01:41.601
- Go, go, go, go!
- Run, Philly, you can do it!

01:42.978 --> 01:45.438
Come on, Freckles!
Keep the ride going, buddy!

01:45.522 --> 01:47.064
- Next batter!
- Me?

01:47.149 --> 01:48.316
Oh, man!
Tough luck!

01:49.526 --> 01:51.277
Irving, here's your big shot.

01:51.361 --> 01:56.282
This is just like Game Seven
of the '26 Series. Babe came to the...

01:56.366 --> 01:59.202
Yeah, yeah.
Listen, you're not Babe Ruth, okay?

01:59.286 --> 02:02.872
Now look, you've got no strike zone,
so he's guaranteed to walk you.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.749
- Batter up!
- Just don't swing.

02:04.833 --> 02:07.293
- He's gonna whiff. Bring it in.
- Easy out, easy out.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.086
- Let him walk you.
- Don't swing at it, Irving!

02:10.172 --> 02:11.756
Yeah, don't swing!

02:11.840 --> 02:15.176
If I don't swing,
how are you gonna know I can hit?

02:17.054 --> 02:18.763
Don't swing, Irving!

02:19.348 --> 02:22.308
Hey, batter, batter, batter,
hey, batter, batter, swing!

02:22.392 --> 02:24.393
- Strike one!
- What did I just tell you?

02:24.478 --> 02:28.397
- Come on.
- You've got no strike zone!

02:30.734 --> 02:33.361
- Strike two!
- Just take the pitch!

02:35.364 --> 02:38.991
Don't swing!
Don't swing, Irving!

02:39.076 --> 02:40.910
Don't swing at it, Irving!

02:43.789 --> 02:49.669
Now batting, number one,
Yankee Irving!

02:58.470 --> 03:00.012
Ah!

03:00.764 --> 03:02.265
Nice job, whiff.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.517
That's it.
You're never playing on my team again.

03:04.601 --> 03:05.977
Give it up.
Go home.

03:06.061 --> 03:08.187
Yeah, don't come back.
Come on, let's get out of here.

03:08.272 --> 03:09.397
Loser.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.276
Honey! Dinnertime!

03:37.301 --> 03:38.426
Huh?

03:48.896 --> 03:49.979
Hmm.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.110
Hmm.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.616
Guess nobody wants you
in the game either.

04:03.035 --> 04:06.412
Hey, Irving, you stink!

04:18.675 --> 04:20.593
The Movietone News.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.930
Bringing you the news
just days after it's happened.

04:24.014 --> 04:28.768
In sporting news, the Yankees continue
their splendiferous winning streak.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.646
It's Game Three of the World Series.

04:31.730 --> 04:34.649
Bottom of the ninth,
the Yankees down by three,

04:34.733 --> 04:38.319
bases loaded,
Babe Ruth steps up to the plate.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.906
Will the Sultan of Swat save the day?

04:42.240 --> 04:43.324
You betcha!

04:44.534 --> 04:47.203
So what's Napoleon Cross,
owner of the Chicago Cubs,

04:47.287 --> 04:49.538
going to do now?

04:49.623 --> 04:51.916
With his best bat, Darlin', in his hands,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.543
Babe Ruth is unstoppable.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.921
Babe Ruth. Babe Ruth.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.840
Babe Ruth and his best bat, Darlin'.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.384
He's everywhere!

05:01.468 --> 05:05.471
Every newsreel, every newspaper
talks about Babe Ruth.

05:05.555 --> 05:09.475
Look at all this stuff! Babe Ruth
sippy cup, Babe Ruth silver dollars,

05:09.559 --> 05:13.187
Babe Ruth underpants,
obviously for the larger child.

05:14.773 --> 05:17.066
What's he got that I haven't got?

05:17.150 --> 05:22.697
He's got a World Series trophy!
And I want one!

05:22.781 --> 05:26.158
- Is that too much to ask?
- No, not at all.

05:26.243 --> 05:29.704
Why don't you put me back in, Mr. Cross?
I'll help you win that trophy.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.872
I'm working on a new pitch. I call it...

05:31.957 --> 05:33.165
Are you ready?

05:33.250 --> 05:34.542
The booger ball.

05:35.961 --> 05:38.170
No, Lefty,
even with your most outrageous cheating

05:38.255 --> 05:40.089
you're no match for Babe Ruth.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.426
Cheating? Me? Babe Ruth's the cheater.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.678
I bet he's got some lucky
voodoo charm or something.

05:45.762 --> 05:46.804
That's cheating.

05:48.015 --> 05:51.600
You're right, Lefty.
Babe Ruth does have a lucky charm.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.812
What is it, what is it, what is it?
It's his bat.

05:54.896 --> 05:57.690
So what do we do?
I'll tell you what we do.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.276
We take away his bat. Let's do the math.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.946
- Going into the light.
- Babe without bat is nothing.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.657
Without that bat, he's just big and fat!

06:09.578 --> 06:11.370
Put that on a T-shirt.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.792
Yeah, I like it.
It's good stuff, it's good stuff.

06:16.877 --> 06:20.046
Only one problem.
How we gonna get Babe Ruth's lucky bat?

06:20.130 --> 06:24.050
- Not "we," you.
- But, Mr. Cross, I...

06:24.134 --> 06:28.179
Get me that bat. And I think
the only way to get it is to steal it.

06:29.806 --> 06:33.476
Otherwise, you're out!

06:42.152 --> 06:44.987
- Hi, honey, how was your day?
- Hey, Mom.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.239
- Is Dad home yet?
- Not yet.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.366
- He's working late.
- Again?

06:49.451 --> 06:52.328
- Dinner will be ready soon.
- Not hungry.

07:00.504 --> 07:02.421
Why do I always get stuck
with the loser?

07:02.506 --> 07:04.590
Yankee Irving again!

07:07.177 --> 07:08.594
He's working late.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.598
That's it.
You're never playing on my team again.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.517
You're not Babe Ruth, okay?

07:14.935 --> 07:16.894
Why do we always get stuck
with Yankee?

07:45.590 --> 07:48.384
You think you could take your thumb
out of my eye?

07:48.468 --> 07:49.718
Whoa!

08:05.735 --> 08:06.819
Huh?

08:07.654 --> 08:08.779
What?

08:09.114 --> 08:11.532
- Are you talking?
- I am.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.160
One smart fella, he felt smart.
Two smart fellas, they felt smart.

08:14.244 --> 08:17.079
Three smart fellas, they all felt smart.
I'm talking.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.498
Wait a second. Where are you going?

08:19.583 --> 08:21.876
Back to the sandlot,
where I was peacefully decomposing.

08:23.086 --> 08:25.254
Hey, watch it there, grabby hands!

08:25.380 --> 08:28.215
Don't make me go all
crazy eight ball on you.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.429
Whoa!

08:35.599 --> 08:37.558
Where did you go?

08:45.567 --> 08:47.526
Hey, Fuzzy, how do I get out of here?

08:47.611 --> 08:50.279
- This kid is nuts.
- I just wanna talk.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.405
And I just wanna leave.

08:52.616 --> 08:56.785
Hey, genius, it just so happens
you left a gaping hole in the infield.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.871
Sayonara.

08:59.456 --> 09:03.083
Your living room is a little cramped.
And dark.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.088
Huh?

09:09.716 --> 09:12.092
I'm rollin' in style!

09:12.177 --> 09:13.344
Whoa!

09:13.428 --> 09:17.973
Nobody gets their mitts on Screwie.
I'm going back to the sandlot.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.433
Ouch!

09:19.976 --> 09:24.355
Why can't I break a window?
Every other ball can break a window.

09:24.439 --> 09:25.564
Gotcha.

09:25.815 --> 09:30.694
- What's going on in here?
- Mom, look, a talking baseball.

09:30.779 --> 09:31.904
He never gets tired of that one.

09:31.988 --> 09:37.618
Oh, my gosh, a talking baseball.
Well, I think I hear the meatloaf talking.

09:37.702 --> 09:41.747
- It's saying, "Yankee, time for dinner."
- Talking meatloaf?

09:41.831 --> 09:45.417
Food can't talk. Except for beans.
They can make themselves heard.

09:45.502 --> 09:48.545
- Go get cleaned up.
- She can't hear you?

09:48.630 --> 09:52.549
I don't know. Let's see. Help!
I've been kidnapped by a deranged child!

09:55.178 --> 09:57.054
Yup, you're right. She can't hear.

09:59.641 --> 10:02.977
Please don't skimp on the soap.
You smell like a week-old hot dog.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.103
Oh!

10:07.857 --> 10:10.859
Kid, quit it.
That's my protective coating of dirt.

10:18.493 --> 10:19.785
I wish Dad was here.

10:19.869 --> 10:23.205
Oh, sweetheart, you know
he's got to work the extra shifts.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.375
I know, but I really need to see him.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.586
Tell you what,
why don't you take him his dinner?

10:29.671 --> 10:32.631
- Really?
- Just this once.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.134
You know you're not supposed
to be there while he's working.

10:35.218 --> 10:36.468
Thanks, Mom.

10:37.721 --> 10:41.223
Great. So just drop me in the sandlot
on the way to see your daddy, and...

10:41.308 --> 10:42.641
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

10:42.726 --> 10:44.560
Making sure
you don't go anywhere.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.980
- Not the underpants drawer!
- Don't worry. They're clean.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.608
Not anymore.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.013
Wow!

11:46.289 --> 11:51.210
Now batting for the New York Yankees,
number one, Yankee Irving!

11:51.294 --> 11:52.920
Hey, Dad.

11:56.091 --> 11:57.257
What are you doing here?

11:57.342 --> 12:00.094
I wanted to see you. I brought you dinner.

12:00.178 --> 12:01.512
Great. What are we having?

12:01.596 --> 12:03.722
Mom's mystery meatloaf.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.058
Hmm.

12:06.142 --> 12:09.269
Meatloaf. Let's start with dessert.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.064
So, what's new?

12:12.148 --> 12:14.400
Dad, you're not gonna believe this.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.652
Oh, no? Try me.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.738
I found a talking baseball.

12:19.823 --> 12:21.698
Oh, really? Does he have a name?

12:22.909 --> 12:23.951
I call him Screwie.

12:24.035 --> 12:26.036
Oh, yeah? Where'd you find it?

12:26.121 --> 12:27.371
At the sandlot.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.417
Did you play ball today?

12:31.501 --> 12:34.878
Yeah, but I don't think
I wanna play anymore.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.673
Hey, I thought you loved baseball.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.592
Well, I think I'm in a slump.

12:40.677 --> 12:41.844
Hmm.

12:41.928 --> 12:46.223
You know, I was watching the team
practice the other day, and it struck me,

12:46.307 --> 12:48.642
here are guys who make a living
playing baseball.

12:48.726 --> 12:53.272
They play every day, and even on the day
after they lose a game,

12:53.356 --> 12:56.191
they're still standing at the plate
swinging that bat.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.986
And you know
how they got to be so good?

13:01.114 --> 13:02.239
They just keep swinging?

13:03.700 --> 13:05.784
Come on, I got something to show you.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.204
Babe Ruth!

14:15.939 --> 14:17.606
Is that Darlin'?

14:17.690 --> 14:19.566
Yup. Sure is.

14:20.235 --> 14:24.279
Babe had that bat custom made
three years ago.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.032
That was the first year
he hit 50 home runs.

14:28.117 --> 14:31.703
That's right. People say she was made
from a thousand-year-old tree

14:31.788 --> 14:34.164
growing on the side of Mount Olympus.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.125
I'm pretty sure it was made in Kentucky.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.836
Hey, come on, pal, we should head home.

14:39.921 --> 14:43.840
Oh, come on, Dad,
just another minute, please?

14:46.052 --> 14:48.387
I tell you what, you can stay here
for a few more minutes

14:48.471 --> 14:49.846
while I put my things away.

14:49.931 --> 14:52.933
- Meet you at the back gate. Deal?
- Yeah.

14:53.851 --> 14:54.935
Yankee, don't touch anything

14:55.019 --> 14:56.812
and make sure you close the door
when you leave.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.982
I promise.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

15:18.710 --> 15:21.211
- You! What are you doing?
- Nothing.

15:22.338 --> 15:27.884
- I was just helping my dad mop up.
- Scram!

15:31.180 --> 15:33.140
What are you looking at?

15:51.367 --> 15:52.576
Here you go!

16:10.219 --> 16:15.766
Kid! Kid! Hey, kid! Wake up!

16:15.850 --> 16:18.143
You're turning me into a spitball.

16:27.236 --> 16:30.030
How long you been taking
trombone lessons?

16:32.492 --> 16:34.076
Good morning.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.539
I thought you were giving that up.

16:39.624 --> 16:42.709
My dad says you should never
give up something you love.

16:42.794 --> 16:45.587
- Has he ever seen you bat?
- Hey!

16:47.799 --> 16:51.510
So, you know a lot about baseball, right?

16:51.594 --> 16:53.553
I mean, since you are one.

16:53.638 --> 16:56.181
I know one thing about baseball, it stinks.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.975
And you saw me play baseball, right?

16:59.060 --> 17:01.812
Make that two things.
It stinks and so do you.

17:01.896 --> 17:04.314
Well, then maybe
you can give me some pointers.

17:04.398 --> 17:09.778
I could point you to another hobby.
How about marbles or kite watching?

17:10.113 --> 17:12.531
You can watch people fly kites.

17:12.615 --> 17:15.659
How can you hate baseball?
You are a baseball.

17:15.742 --> 17:19.704
Kid, look,
baseball's only gonna break your heart.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.580
Did you know I made it to the majors?

17:21.665 --> 17:24.876
- You were in the majors?
- Oh, yeah.

17:24.961 --> 17:28.714
I remember it like it was yesterday.
Sun was shining,

17:28.798 --> 17:32.300
forty thousand fans screaming
as I'm tossed to the mound.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.219
It was like a dream come true.

17:34.303 --> 17:37.389
All I ever wanted was to be home run ball.

17:37.473 --> 17:43.103
And on the very first pitch, crack,
I'm on my way going, going,

17:43.187 --> 17:44.563
foul.

17:44.647 --> 17:47.649
That's right, kid, foul ball.

17:48.109 --> 17:49.651
Right out of the park.

17:49.736 --> 17:55.031
Dreams and everything vanished.
And did anyone ever come look for me?

17:55.908 --> 17:58.827
No. They left me out there to rot.

17:59.120 --> 18:03.665
So believe me when I tell you,
baseball is a field of broken dreams.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.375
Trust me, I know.

18:09.005 --> 18:12.424
- Mr. Robinson.
- Good morning, Stanley. Mrs. Irving.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.259
I'm sorry to bother you
so early,

18:14.343 --> 18:16.219
but we have a real problem here.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.096
What sort of a problem, sir?

18:18.181 --> 18:20.140
- This is Officer Bryant.
- Hello.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.350
Someone broke into
the Yankees' locker room.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.145
- Oh, no.
- Babe Ruth's bat is missing.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.773
You were the only one there
with the keys, Mr. Irving.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.149
What are you implying?

18:29.233 --> 18:32.360
Did you see anyone else
in the locker room last night?

18:32.445 --> 18:35.530
- Wait. There was a security guard.
- Yankee...

18:35.615 --> 18:38.658
Dad, after you left the locker room
a security guard came in

18:38.743 --> 18:39.951
and told me to get out.

18:40.036 --> 18:43.830
- You took your son into the locker room?
- It was just for a minute.

18:43.915 --> 18:45.123
Do you mind if I look in his room?

18:45.208 --> 18:48.293
- Excuse me, my son is not a thief.
- Irving.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.879
Thank God you're here. This kid is crazy.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.466
First he put me in the underpants drawer,
then he pushed me underwater,

18:54.550 --> 18:56.635
then he forced me to eat meatloaf.

18:56.719 --> 18:57.969
- This is a disaster.
- Meatloaf!

18:58.054 --> 18:59.721
- The Series is only half over.
- Are you listening?

18:59.806 --> 19:03.975
What am I gonna tell the Babe? We need
to pack all the gear for Chicago today.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.435
The bat's not here.

19:07.021 --> 19:11.233
Son, if you know what happened
to the bat, you need to come clean now.

19:11.317 --> 19:15.695
- But that's what I'm trying to tell you.
- Stanley, this is a real mess.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.781
I... I know, Mr. Robinson.

19:17.907 --> 19:20.116
As the General Manager
of the New York Yankees,

19:20.201 --> 19:22.786
I have no other choice. You're fired.

19:22.870 --> 19:26.623
- Fired?
- Mr. Robinson, please.

19:26.874 --> 19:30.544
Stanley, someone has to be held
responsible. It was your shift.

19:31.420 --> 19:37.300
If Babe's bat is found, then I'll
reconsider, but, until then, I'm sorry.

19:38.010 --> 19:41.638
Stanley, what are we gonna do?
We're gonna be out on the streets.

19:41.722 --> 19:45.267
- I'll get another job. I'll get two jobs.
- There are no jobs.

19:45.434 --> 19:49.521
Yankee, you were alone in that
locker room. Now the bat's missing.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.730
- Stanley...
- Emily,

19:50.815 --> 19:52.816
there was no security guard on duty.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.986
Yes, there was. Maybe he took the bat.

19:56.070 --> 20:00.282
That's enough.
Son, what happened to the bat?

20:00.783 --> 20:01.867
I don't know.

20:01.951 --> 20:04.202
- Go to your room.
- Why don't you believe me?

20:04.287 --> 20:06.454
Go to your room.

20:14.797 --> 20:17.257
What was all that?
What's with the coppers?

20:17.341 --> 20:20.635
- Someone stole Babe Ruth's bat.
- Good.

20:20.845 --> 20:25.056
- Screwie, my dad got fired.
- Not good.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.060
Why would someone steal
Babe's lucky bat?

20:29.145 --> 20:31.521
The Yankees are gonna lose
the Series for sure.

20:31.606 --> 20:34.774
Whoa, kid, you're watching
way too many newsreels.

20:34.859 --> 20:37.235
That lucky bat stuff
is a bunch of malarkey.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.071
How do you know?
You were only in for one pitch.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.448
Ooh, that hurt.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.450
That guard had to take the bat.

20:43.534 --> 20:46.286
Why would a Yankees security guard
steal Babe Ruth's bat?

20:46.370 --> 20:50.373
Now, if it were a Chicago Cubs
security guard, that I could believe.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.292
Wait a minute.

20:57.214 --> 21:00.800
Hey, hey, hey, I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

21:01.469 --> 21:02.677
I still can't breathe.

21:03.888 --> 21:07.015
Hey, I knew I'd seen that face before.

21:08.351 --> 21:10.310
What are you babbling about?

21:10.394 --> 21:12.938
The security guard was Lefty Maginnis,

21:13.022 --> 21:14.564
pitcher for the Chicago Cubs.

21:14.649 --> 21:17.275
Lefty's the biggest cheater
who ever stepped on a mound.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.278
Lefty stole the bat so Babe can't hit.

21:20.363 --> 21:24.032
The Yankees will lose the Series.
I've got to tell Dad.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.034
Yeah, and don't forget to mention
that you heard it

21:26.118 --> 21:28.912
from your friendly neighborhood
talking baseball.

21:28.996 --> 21:31.081
Kid, this is just a crazy theory

21:31.165 --> 21:34.334
and even if it were true,
no one's gonna believe you.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.835
You don't have any proof.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.296
- Then I'll get some proof.
- How?

21:38.381 --> 21:41.549
Most of the Cubs are heading for Chicago.
What're you gonna do?

21:41.634 --> 21:44.469
Sneak out of the house,
go down to Penn Station,

21:44.553 --> 21:46.596
and search every single passenger?

21:46.681 --> 21:48.765
- Right.
- Oh, no.

21:48.849 --> 21:51.643
If we go to Penn Station,
we may catch him there.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.395
I got to learn to keep my mouth shut.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.021
Whoa! Oh!

21:55.106 --> 21:57.691
This can't work. You're just a kid

21:57.775 --> 22:00.402
and this is the real world,
not some fantasy land

22:00.486 --> 22:03.363
- filled with gumdrop fairies and...
- You're coming with me.

22:03.447 --> 22:07.909
Yeah, I think maybe not,
but thanks for the invite.

22:11.747 --> 22:14.791
Screwie, I have to do this for my dad.

22:14.917 --> 22:18.086
All right, don't look at me...
Don't look at me like that.

22:18.170 --> 22:22.173
Stop it, stop...
Okay, fine, let's make a deal.

22:22.258 --> 22:25.552
I'll help you to find the bat
if you take me back to the sandlot,

22:25.636 --> 22:29.347
- and leave me to rot in peace. Deal?
- Deal.

22:30.766 --> 22:31.850
Hmm.

22:38.733 --> 22:39.816
Oh, whoa!

22:39.900 --> 22:41.901
What are we doing?
What are we doing?

22:41.986 --> 22:44.112
Uh-oh.
What do you mean by "uh-oh"?

22:47.116 --> 22:49.159
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

22:50.828 --> 22:54.289
- Okay, we're fine.
- I'm okay.

22:54.540 --> 22:55.749
Not fine!

22:57.001 --> 22:59.794
My head! My butt! My head! My butt!

23:07.511 --> 23:08.678
Oh!

23:09.055 --> 23:12.098
- So far, so good.
- Are you okay?

23:12.183 --> 23:15.018
- You were screaming pretty loud.
- I wasn't screaming.

23:15.102 --> 23:17.479
I was laughing.

23:17.605 --> 23:20.440
Ha! See? Ha, ha, ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Laughing.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.532
There's a million people here.
How we gonna find Lefty?

23:29.617 --> 23:31.785
Just keep looking, all right?

23:35.581 --> 23:39.542
Flyer service to Niagara.
Track 18.

23:44.465 --> 23:45.423
We gotta hurry.

23:45.508 --> 23:48.134
Why don't we come back in 10 years?
When you're taller.

23:48.219 --> 23:52.722
Make way, there, folks.
Coming through, coming through.

23:56.185 --> 23:57.268
See anything yet?

23:57.353 --> 24:01.898
I see a sock, a candy wrapper,
a Life Saver covered in lint.

24:01.982 --> 24:06.778
- Hmm. Pineapple.
- Screwie. This is no time to fool around.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.404
Now do you see anything?

24:08.489 --> 24:11.241
I see thousands of people
going about their business,

24:11.325 --> 24:12.826
none of which is ours.

24:12.910 --> 24:16.788
There's only one train to Chicago,
so Lefty will have to be on it.

24:16.872 --> 24:19.332
- We're gonna stake it out.
- "Stake it out"?

24:19.416 --> 24:21.751
What, what, what,
now you're with the FBI?

24:21.836 --> 24:24.295
All aboard
for the County Peabody Express.

24:24.380 --> 24:27.090
Better off rotting up
in that sandlot.

24:27.174 --> 24:29.926
I got to get stuck
with J. Edgar Hoover Junior, here.

24:30.886 --> 24:34.472
How are we gonna cover the whole train?
There's like 50 cars and 100 passengers,

24:34.557 --> 24:36.766
and... Holy Mackerel!

24:39.186 --> 24:42.730
Bingo. That's got to be Babe's bat.

24:52.867 --> 24:57.245
Okay, we found him. I'll give you that.
But anything could be in that case.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.498
A trombone, a wooden leg, a pogo stick.

25:00.583 --> 25:04.085
Well, there he goes,
so I guess we'll never know. Too bad.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.549
- Come on, boys.
- All aboard!

25:09.925 --> 25:11.634
Hey, wait, wait.
Where are you taking me?

25:15.806 --> 25:18.600
Take a head count
when you get inside, okay?

25:31.864 --> 25:34.365
- I think that's him.
- Let's call the cops.

25:34.450 --> 25:37.911
I'm not sure. Take a closer look.

25:37.995 --> 25:40.205
- Wow!
- Is it him?

25:40.289 --> 25:42.916
There's a horse jumping off a diving board.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.460
Wait, I think that's Eleanor Roosevelt.

25:45.544 --> 25:48.004
Screwie, is it Lefty or not?

25:53.302 --> 25:55.178
Take a quick look as you
roll yourself back.

25:55.262 --> 25:57.805
Roll myself back from...
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

25:58.974 --> 26:03.144
Ow, what a headache! Nope. No.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.149
Hello.

26:09.652 --> 26:10.777
No.

26:19.620 --> 26:20.787
Did you see him?

26:22.039 --> 26:26.292
Third row, aisle seat.
Where are you going?

26:42.518 --> 26:45.478
Good. You got it,
now take me back to the sandlot.

26:46.230 --> 26:47.563
Oh, no!

26:50.484 --> 26:51.526
Huh?

26:54.863 --> 26:55.863
Uh-oh.

27:04.915 --> 27:06.624
Oh, rats!

27:16.510 --> 27:18.052
Oh, no!

27:22.308 --> 27:24.642
Good. That thing's brought us
nothing but trouble.

27:24.727 --> 27:25.977
Hey, you!

27:26.603 --> 27:28.646
Stop right there.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.484
I'm a ball.

27:33.569 --> 27:37.322
I'm probably gonna survive this,
but you, you're a squishy little kid.

27:37.406 --> 27:38.656
Whoa.

27:38.741 --> 27:40.450
Screwie.

27:43.412 --> 27:45.246
Yankee, help me!

27:49.960 --> 27:52.337
Give me back my box, kid.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.554
Huh?

28:10.272 --> 28:11.397
Oh!

28:21.533 --> 28:22.533
Huh?

28:27.790 --> 28:29.916
Oh, yeah, the kid's still got the moves.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.542
Sir, I need to see your ticket!

28:50.270 --> 28:51.813
Whoa!

29:01.448 --> 29:07.328
Whoa!

29:07.413 --> 29:10.039
Kid, you're gonna get such a time-out.

29:19.675 --> 29:21.759
The fun's over, you little punk.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.522
Screwie, hang on!

29:37.317 --> 29:38.317
Gotcha!

29:38.402 --> 29:39.527
Hey, you...

29:39.611 --> 29:40.695
Hit him! Use your elbow.

29:41.947 --> 29:44.490
Kicking is good.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.414
Oh, that can't feel good.

29:52.166 --> 29:53.916
Doesn't really hurt so bad.

29:54.543 --> 29:56.294
Wait. Yes, it does hurt.

29:56.378 --> 29:57.753
Here it comes. Oh, yeah.

30:00.340 --> 30:01.424
Oh!

30:15.939 --> 30:17.690
But I need to get to New York.

30:17.774 --> 30:21.360
New York? That way.
You can buy yourself a ticket inside.

30:30.913 --> 30:31.954
Oh, great.

30:32.039 --> 30:35.249
No tickets, no train, no sandlot.

30:37.085 --> 30:38.920
What could be worse?

30:39.546 --> 30:42.590
Well, at least I got the bat.

30:56.271 --> 30:58.981
- Oh, here she goes again.
- Help me, somebody. Help me.

30:59.066 --> 31:02.652
I'm not supposed to be here.
Help me!

31:02.736 --> 31:04.695
Whoa, sister, relax.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.906
You're a hunk of wood,
not the Hope Diamond.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.282
Do you know who I am?

31:08.367 --> 31:11.911
I am Darlin', honey. I'm the Babe's bat.

31:11.995 --> 31:16.332
Born of a 1000-year-old tree
on the side of Mount Olympus.

31:16.458 --> 31:17.542
Struck by lightning,

31:17.626 --> 31:21.462
and carved by monks using
the horn of a unicorn.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.548
Since when do monks make baseball bats?

31:23.632 --> 31:26.842
- Are you calling me a liar?
- No, of course not.

31:26.927 --> 31:29.720
In fact, I was made
from the hide of Seabiscuit,

31:29.805 --> 31:32.390
and stitched together by Betsy Ross!

31:32.474 --> 31:34.684
Screwie was in the Major Leagues, too.

31:34.768 --> 31:37.395
He'd have been a home run ball,
if he hadn't fouled out.

31:37.479 --> 31:38.437
- Oh.
- Kid, don't.

31:38.522 --> 31:42.275
A foul ball? Really?
Well, isn't that impressive.

31:42.776 --> 31:45.361
I've hit thousands of guys
that were better than you.

31:45.445 --> 31:47.572
You know, you bats are all prima donnas.

31:47.656 --> 31:49.865
You only come out
three or four times a game,

31:49.950 --> 31:51.534
carried to the plate and back.

31:51.618 --> 31:55.705
"Oh, don't let me lay in this dirt.
Where's my batboy?"

31:55.789 --> 31:57.248
Well, here's what you know.

31:57.332 --> 32:02.086
I don't need anybody to carry me around.
I can handle myself. Put me down.

32:03.297 --> 32:04.463
- Put me down!
- Whoa!

32:05.173 --> 32:06.340
Okay.

32:08.719 --> 32:10.511
So long, farm team.

32:17.352 --> 32:18.561
Excuse me.

32:22.691 --> 32:23.858
Two.

32:28.488 --> 32:29.572
You know something?

32:29.656 --> 32:32.241
If you think
I'm rolling all the way to Chicago,

32:32.326 --> 32:35.828
you've got another thing coming.
You may pick me up.

32:37.164 --> 32:38.706
If, in fact, you're rescuing me,

32:38.790 --> 32:43.628
then I assume that you are returning me
to my rightful owner, Mr. Babe Ruth,

32:43.712 --> 32:47.465
who, as I'm sure you're aware,
is currently in Chicago

32:47.549 --> 32:49.425
playing in the World Series.

32:49.718 --> 32:52.928
You have heard of the World Series,
haven't you, ball?

32:53.013 --> 32:56.307
Oh, yeah,
I've heard of the World Series.

32:56.391 --> 32:58.684
But we ain't going to Chicago,
we're going to New York.

32:58.769 --> 33:00.853
New York? Why?

33:00.937 --> 33:03.564
I just told you Babe is in Chicago.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.359
When Lefty stole you, my dad got fired.

33:06.610 --> 33:09.445
If I take you to New York,
then he'll get his job back.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.656
Oh, no, no, no.
You gotta take me to Babe.

33:11.740 --> 33:15.326
Hey, table leg,
don't put any crazy ideas into his head.

33:15.410 --> 33:18.287
We are not going to Chicago.
We are going to New York.

33:18.372 --> 33:20.498
That's it. The baseball has spoken.

33:20.582 --> 33:23.417
- But...
- I said, "The baseball has spoken."

33:24.169 --> 33:26.295
Fine, that's all right with me.

33:26.380 --> 33:29.924
I just happen to know that
Mr. Babe Ruth is a generous man,

33:30.008 --> 33:32.635
and I'm sure he could get
your daddy's job back.

33:32.719 --> 33:34.553
Maybe even with a big raise.

33:34.638 --> 33:38.099
But y'all want to go to New York,
we'll go to New York.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.518
Only you can make that decision.

33:44.940 --> 33:47.108
Oh, Stanley, where could he be?

33:49.861 --> 33:51.278
This is all my fault.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.156
I was too hard on him.

33:54.241 --> 33:55.991
How will we ever find him?

33:57.285 --> 33:59.912
I think it's time to call the police.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.460
Ouch! Ouch!

34:23.645 --> 34:24.687
Is that our train?

34:25.856 --> 34:27.898
I don't think so.

34:28.775 --> 34:29.900
Oh.

34:31.445 --> 34:33.487
I know that smell.

34:36.032 --> 34:38.159
Kid, kid, wake up.

34:38.452 --> 34:39.452
Wake up.

34:39.536 --> 34:41.579
- Hey, what do you...
- Quiet.

34:41.663 --> 34:42.913
Lefty's here.

34:44.291 --> 34:45.583
Oh, no.

34:49.170 --> 34:50.504
Get it back some...

34:53.175 --> 34:55.926
Oh, he's gonna be sorry.

34:57.137 --> 34:58.512
I'll have a non-fat mochaccino, please.

34:59.723 --> 35:02.016
Quiet, tentpole. It's the bad guy.

35:02.142 --> 35:05.394
...use his head for batting practice.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.272
Whack, whack, whack, whack, whack.

35:08.565 --> 35:09.690
Babe Ruth, stop hitting yourself.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.194
Seriously, why are you
hitting yourself, Babe?

35:13.695 --> 35:16.739
- What?
- Hello, Mr. Cross, it's Lefty Maginnis.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.157
Ah! Lefty.

35:18.241 --> 35:20.409
I've been expecting your call
for several hours.

35:20.494 --> 35:23.621
- From now on, we have to talk in code.
- What?

35:23.705 --> 35:25.873
Are you on the way to Cairo?

35:25.957 --> 35:29.877
- I thought you wanted me in Chicago.
- It's ode-kay, you idiot-ay!

35:30.170 --> 35:32.630
Do you have
our little wooden friend with you?

35:32.714 --> 35:36.217
Yeah, yeah, I've got the bat right here.

35:36.510 --> 35:38.260
Listen.

35:38.720 --> 35:41.806
- And no one even suspects us.
- Us?

35:41.890 --> 35:43.891
Raoul, there is no "us."

35:43.975 --> 35:46.852
If you get caught,
I don't know anything about this.

35:46.937 --> 35:50.397
- Absolutamente not.
- No, Mr. Cross, I just meant

35:50.482 --> 35:52.900
they blamed it on some janitor and his kid.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.110
Get this. They fired the guy.

35:57.405 --> 35:59.615
We're... I mean, I'm in the clear.

35:59.908 --> 36:03.160
So, now that I have the bat
I'm pitching in the Series, right?

36:03.245 --> 36:04.662
Not so fast, Raoul.

36:04.746 --> 36:07.665
When you make the delivery,
we can discuss your compensation.

36:07.749 --> 36:12.086
- Oh, but Mr. Cross.
- I look forward to seeing the package.

36:13.880 --> 36:17.174
Oh, what's wrong, little Babe Ruth
bobble-head? You don't approve?

36:17.259 --> 36:18.717
You look a little groggy. Are you?

36:18.802 --> 36:21.720
Well, perhaps you can use
a seventh-inning stretch.

36:33.108 --> 36:34.149
Yeah.

36:44.327 --> 36:47.454
Ow.

36:49.791 --> 36:51.584
Wait till I get...

36:57.132 --> 36:59.717
- Bottom of the ninth, kid.
- Train!

37:00.969 --> 37:02.469
Yankee!

37:04.514 --> 37:06.348
Holy cow!

37:13.982 --> 37:16.150
Mama!

37:25.285 --> 37:27.912
Now, what?
We're going to Chicago, silly.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.330
We head for New York,
right, kid?

37:29.414 --> 37:31.749
I don't know. Just let me think.

37:31.833 --> 37:33.417
Why don't we flip a coin?

37:33.501 --> 37:36.170
Heads, we go to New York.
Tails, we burn the bat.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.380
Now, that was rude and uncalled for.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.384
What's that?

37:42.677 --> 37:43.802
- Wolves?
- Wolves?

37:43.887 --> 37:45.095
We're in Pittsburgh.

37:45.180 --> 37:47.681
Wolves are too scared
to come to Pittsburgh.

37:48.183 --> 37:50.100
- Oh, kid.
- Screwie!

37:50.185 --> 37:52.061
Help! Help!
Run, Yankee.

37:52.145 --> 37:54.271
Forget him. Run. Save me.

37:54.356 --> 37:56.941
Don't eat me.
You don't know where I've been.

37:57.359 --> 38:00.778
The stench!
I bet even dogs think you have dog breath.

38:04.866 --> 38:05.991
Ow!

38:06.076 --> 38:08.285
- Hey.
- Screwie.

38:08.370 --> 38:09.745
Screwie.

38:09.829 --> 38:13.332
Remember, protect me at all costs.

38:21.883 --> 38:23.801
All right, all right.

38:23.885 --> 38:26.804
I'm doing the best I can with what I got.

38:26.888 --> 38:30.391
- Who are these guys?
- I think they're pirates.

38:30.725 --> 38:34.061
- In Pennsylvania?
- Pittsburgh Pirates, okay?

38:41.403 --> 38:42.403
Huh?

38:43.863 --> 38:47.491
Sorry.
I was just looking for my ball.

38:47.575 --> 38:48.701
Oh, you mean this?

38:49.911 --> 38:51.036
- Whoa.
- Hey.

38:51.121 --> 38:53.080
- Daisy, easy with that.
- Come on, play dead.

38:53.164 --> 38:55.541
Sit, sit. Oh, for crying out loud.

38:56.501 --> 38:59.545
Don't worry, she won't go far.
Not with dinner almost ready.

39:01.006 --> 39:03.048
Louie, I think we have a guest.

39:04.592 --> 39:06.510
Mmm. This is good.

39:06.594 --> 39:08.220
What's your name, son?

39:08.304 --> 39:10.305
- Yankee Irving, sir.
- Yankee?

39:10.390 --> 39:12.433
Yankee Irving. I like that name.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.518
Hey, kid, it's a pleasure to meet you.

39:16.688 --> 39:18.439
Hey, hey, quit it, will you?

39:18.690 --> 39:20.024
Hmm. Mmm.

39:31.703 --> 39:35.039
- Are you guys...
- Bums?

39:35.123 --> 39:36.707
No.

39:36.791 --> 39:39.209
- No, we're not bums.
- I'm a bum.

39:39.294 --> 39:40.711
Yes, Jack's a bum.

39:40.795 --> 39:43.839
But the rest of us
have just fallen on hard times.

39:45.633 --> 39:46.842
Perfect.

39:46.926 --> 39:48.594
Don't move a muscle, Jack.

39:48.678 --> 39:50.554
For the New York Yankees...

39:50.638 --> 39:53.682
I got it! Hey, guys, the game is on!

39:53.767 --> 39:55.726
The game. Babe.

39:55.810 --> 39:57.186
- Finally.
- Game's on!

39:57.270 --> 39:59.730
Let's see if he can pull off a miracle.

39:59.814 --> 40:01.398
- Hit it.
- You can do it.

40:01.483 --> 40:03.275
- Oh, come on, Babe.
- It's switched the defense. Strike two.

40:03.359 --> 40:04.818
- No, no.
- Oh, no.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.071
- Babe, come on.
- I can't listen to this.

40:07.155 --> 40:10.449
- I can't listen to this.
- Come on, come on, come on.

40:10.533 --> 40:13.035
- Come on, Babe.
- You can do it.

40:13.119 --> 40:14.411
It all comes down
to this pitch.

40:14.496 --> 40:15.829
Come on, Babe.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.582
- Babe settles into the box.
- Come on, Babe. Come on, Babe.

40:18.666 --> 40:21.418
Here's the wind up. Here's the swing.
Strike three.

40:21.503 --> 40:23.253
- Oh, no.
- Not again.

40:23.338 --> 40:24.421
Struck out...

40:25.673 --> 40:27.382
Oh, no.

40:27.509 --> 40:31.929
...in this fifth game of the World Series.
- See, I told you he needed me.

40:32.097 --> 40:35.599
Babe's never struck out this many times.

40:36.726 --> 40:40.771
I should've returned you by now.
This is all my fault.

40:42.023 --> 40:46.110
- Hey, buck up, Yankee.
- There's always another game tomorrow.

40:46.194 --> 40:49.446
And the Babe,
the Babe always bounces back.

40:49.531 --> 40:51.365
Oh, come on, son.

40:51.491 --> 40:53.951
Babe's got a big old heart.
He won't let us down.

40:54.035 --> 40:56.328
Look, when Babe was a kid,
he had nothing.

40:56.412 --> 40:58.455
Then he picks up a bat, he starts swinging,

40:58.540 --> 40:59.957
look where it got him.

41:00.041 --> 41:01.750
If Babe can do it, so can we.

41:03.002 --> 41:05.129
Hey, guys, you hear that?

41:05.213 --> 41:08.215
That's the 10:15 Manhattan Express
headed straight for New York.

41:08.299 --> 41:11.343
All right, let's pack it up.
We're moving out.

41:12.053 --> 41:13.804
It's about time.

41:23.731 --> 41:25.107
Whoa!

41:25.275 --> 41:27.151
Come on, Daisy. Come on.

41:27.235 --> 41:28.569
That's it.

41:28.653 --> 41:30.028
- Yankee!
- Come on, kid.

41:30.113 --> 41:31.488
Come on, Yankee!

41:34.450 --> 41:35.659
Grab on!

41:35.743 --> 41:36.910
Yankee, come on!

41:38.204 --> 41:39.746
Come on, son!

41:39.956 --> 41:42.207
Yankee, come on, run. Keep running.

41:42.292 --> 41:43.834
No, keep running.

41:43.918 --> 41:45.127
Keep on running.

41:45.211 --> 41:47.254
- Why is he not running?
- I don't know.

41:48.131 --> 41:52.926
Sorry, guys, I can't go.
I've got to give Babe his bat back.

41:53.052 --> 41:56.555
- What did he say?
- He said he's going to get his backpack.

41:57.473 --> 42:00.058
- Bye.
- Yankee, what're you doing?

42:00.143 --> 42:03.020
You heard those guys. Babe's their hero.

42:03.104 --> 42:05.022
Babe's everyone's hero,

42:05.106 --> 42:08.150
and I can't let them down,
and I can't let my dad down.

42:08.276 --> 42:11.528
- We're going to Chicago.
- Oh, thank you.

42:11.613 --> 42:14.865
Thank you.
I knew you were gonna see this my way.

42:14.949 --> 42:17.534
This is great. We had a deal, Yankee.

42:17.619 --> 42:21.038
And you, you rotten two-by-four,
this is all your fault.

42:21.122 --> 42:23.332
You tricked him.
You messed everything up.

42:23.416 --> 42:25.626
Face it, leather face, you're beat.

42:25.710 --> 42:29.213
Fine, I can't trust you.
I'll go back to New York on my own.

42:33.468 --> 42:34.551
Whoa!

42:34.636 --> 42:36.470
Yankee!

42:38.306 --> 42:40.682
I guess a couple of days in Chicago
couldn't hurt.

42:40.767 --> 42:43.101
I've been curious
about their deep-dish pizza,

42:43.186 --> 42:45.979
but after that I'm heading back
to the Big Apple.

42:47.982 --> 42:50.651
You know, I was just a splinter
when I first read about it.

42:50.735 --> 42:53.070
So after Babe and I
were presented to the court,

42:53.154 --> 42:56.240
the Queen invited us to try our hand
at an English sport.

42:56.324 --> 42:59.826
And there was this cheeky cricket bat
who kept trying to look down my tape

42:59.911 --> 43:03.413
and I... Why are we stopping?

43:04.374 --> 43:06.875
'Cause I'm tired and hungry.

43:06.960 --> 43:09.086
- You guys ever eat?
- No.

43:09.170 --> 43:11.463
I've got to maintain this very trim figure.

43:11.547 --> 43:12.839
Trim? Ha!

43:12.924 --> 43:15.092
From where I'm sitting,
I see lots of grain.

43:15.176 --> 43:17.594
- Are you saying I'm plump?
- I'm saying you're fat, bat.

43:17.679 --> 43:21.682
Excuse me, I have been examined
by scientists around the world,

43:21.766 --> 43:24.101
who can't figure out
how I can look this good

43:24.185 --> 43:26.728
- and swing so well.
- Blah, blah, blah, blah.

43:26.813 --> 43:29.439
Have these scientists done research
about your big mouth?

43:29.524 --> 43:31.858
- Can you say the same, Scarface?
- I'm not gonna sit here

43:31.943 --> 43:33.902
- and listen to this.
- I don't think so.

43:33.987 --> 43:37.114
- Hey, look, a baseball.
- Hey, look, the missing link.

43:38.283 --> 43:39.700
Put me down.

43:39.784 --> 43:41.285
Hey...

43:43.496 --> 43:44.830
- Give him back.
- Him?

43:46.040 --> 43:47.916
What did you do? Name it?

43:48.001 --> 43:50.585
What's he got?
A little bed or something?

43:50.670 --> 43:52.963
- Do you dress him up?
- Give him back.

43:53.047 --> 43:54.881
- Give him back.
- Hey, Yankee.

43:54.966 --> 43:57.467
- Help!
- Oh, let him have him, Yankee.

43:57.552 --> 43:59.386
All he does is complain anyway.

43:59.470 --> 44:02.764
We can find a ball with a better attitude.
Like a tennis ball.

44:02.849 --> 44:05.517
They're all warm and fuzzy.

44:08.563 --> 44:11.315
- You, give him back that ball!
- Get lost, Marti.

44:11.399 --> 44:14.818
- Take that!
- Yeah, mind your own business.

44:19.157 --> 44:22.659
Hey, kid,
you gonna let a girl fight for you?

44:24.746 --> 44:25.996
No.

44:26.247 --> 44:27.873
But I'll let her help.

44:29.542 --> 44:31.710
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Let's get your ball back.

44:35.882 --> 44:38.258
Looks like we're fighting two girls.

44:48.019 --> 44:49.102
Ow.

44:49.187 --> 44:51.021
You got him right in the head.

44:51.105 --> 44:53.023
The kid's not even ducking.

44:53.107 --> 44:54.358
Watch out.

44:54.442 --> 44:57.361
- You gotta start dodging these apples.
- I'm trying.

44:57.445 --> 44:59.696
No, you're not.
Don't look where they're going.

44:59.781 --> 45:02.741
You gotta watch
where they're starting from.

45:12.919 --> 45:15.420
- Yeah, that's it.
- Okay.

45:16.130 --> 45:19.424
What're you looking at me for?
Watch the apples.

45:19.801 --> 45:22.761
Don't you make me break out
my whuppin' stick.

45:24.305 --> 45:26.056
Incoming!

45:27.642 --> 45:30.685
I've been hit. I feel like a Danish.

45:30.770 --> 45:32.145
Come on.

45:32.772 --> 45:33.855
Ow!

45:36.484 --> 45:38.777
All right, just take your stupid ball.

45:41.280 --> 45:42.447
Yeah!

45:47.286 --> 45:48.412
Oh!

45:49.497 --> 45:50.831
Medic!

45:51.874 --> 45:54.709
Hold me, I'm so cold.

45:55.378 --> 45:57.170
Come on.

46:09.142 --> 46:10.142
Ow!

46:14.439 --> 46:17.107
- Thanks for helping me back there.
- No problem.

46:17.191 --> 46:19.276
You were really starting
to get the hang of it.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.111
That Tubby Tyler
will be picking apple seeds

46:21.195 --> 46:23.071
out of his teeth for a week.

46:26.033 --> 46:29.911
- Whoa, you can really throw.
- "Fastball" is my middle name.

46:29.996 --> 46:32.873
My daddy taught me to pitch
when I was four years old.

46:32.957 --> 46:35.792
- Really?
- Come on, I'll show you.

46:36.794 --> 46:39.379
- Hey, Mom, this is Yankee.
- Hi.

46:39.505 --> 46:41.339
- Hello.
- Pleased to... Whoa!

46:43.885 --> 46:45.218
Holy mackerel.

46:46.471 --> 46:47.762
My heavens!

46:48.222 --> 46:50.223
This is my dad right here.

46:50.308 --> 46:53.351
He's a pitcher for the Cincinnati Tigers.

46:53.436 --> 46:55.645
Your dad is Lonnie Brewster?

46:55.730 --> 46:58.398
Lonnie "The Rooster" Brewster?

46:58.483 --> 47:00.984
- The king of the curve ball?
- That's right.

47:02.195 --> 47:03.737
He can pitch to me anytime.

47:03.821 --> 47:06.990
- I think I'm gonna pitch my lunch.
- Whoa.

47:07.074 --> 47:08.783
No-hitter in Cleveland.

47:08.868 --> 47:12.329
That was the ten-inning game
that he threw twenty strike-outs.

47:12.413 --> 47:14.873
- Grand slam in Milwaukee.
- Yeah.

47:14.957 --> 47:16.666
That was the game were my dad made

47:16.751 --> 47:18.877
- two triple plays.
- Triple plays.

47:19.879 --> 47:23.507
- Your dad's incredible.
- Yeah, he sure is.

47:23.591 --> 47:27.010
- He's my hero.
- My dad works at Yankee Stadium.

47:27.094 --> 47:28.762
Really?

47:29.013 --> 47:31.932
Do you ever dream of playing
at Yankee Stadium?

47:32.517 --> 47:34.434
Oh, yeah, all the time.

47:35.603 --> 47:40.857
But I'm kind of in a slump right now.
I'll never be good enough.

47:40.942 --> 47:43.527
Yankee, did you run away from home?

47:43.611 --> 47:47.113
I'm not running away. I'm on a mission.

47:47.490 --> 47:50.116
This is Babe Ruth's bat.

47:50.201 --> 47:51.993
That's not Darlin', is it?

47:52.119 --> 47:55.956
Yeah. I have to get her to Babe,
in Chicago, right away.

47:56.040 --> 48:00.293
Hey, maybe my dad can help.
His team is heading there tomorrow.

48:05.341 --> 48:08.843
- Hello. May I help you?
- Hello.

48:09.512 --> 48:12.305
I've been worried sick about my son.

48:12.390 --> 48:14.891
You know,
since he's my son and everything.

48:17.061 --> 48:20.021
Just give this to my dad.
He's playing in Toledo.

48:20.147 --> 48:23.233
- Thanks.
- Yankee, your dad's here.

48:23.317 --> 48:24.484
Dad?

48:26.028 --> 48:28.905
Come on, son. Time to go.

48:28.990 --> 48:30.949
- He's not my dad!
- Run, Yankee.

48:31.033 --> 48:32.576
- Out of my way.
- Marti!

48:36.497 --> 48:38.415
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right.

48:38.541 --> 48:40.959
You stop it right there, Mister.

48:41.836 --> 48:46.590
Whoa!

48:47.049 --> 48:49.467
Just you wait
till the police get here.

49:08.446 --> 49:09.529
Oh!

49:09.614 --> 49:11.781
Run, Yankee!

49:15.786 --> 49:17.871
Run, Yankee. Run!

49:20.041 --> 49:22.125
Give me the bat. Give me the bat.

49:23.461 --> 49:25.587
Give me that bat.

49:30.509 --> 49:32.302
Okay, kid, you've had your fun.

49:32.386 --> 49:34.137
- Now give me the bat back.
- No.

49:34.221 --> 49:37.307
I'm taking her to Chicago,
and giving her back to Babe.

49:37.391 --> 49:40.185
- You tell him, Yank.
- I stole this thing fair and square.

49:40.269 --> 49:42.395
My dad's gonna get his job back.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.939
Yeah, well, I want my job back.

49:45.024 --> 49:49.069
I'm a pitcher. I pitch.
What does a janitor do? Janit?

49:50.363 --> 49:52.197
Oh, oh, my nose...

49:55.534 --> 49:56.701
Oh!

49:56.786 --> 49:58.286
Take that, you bum.

50:00.039 --> 50:03.124
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

50:04.502 --> 50:08.004
Marti, I just want to say...

50:08.089 --> 50:09.130
Mmm-hmm?

50:09.215 --> 50:11.174
- I want the bat.
- Yankee,

50:11.258 --> 50:12.884
- let's get out of here.
- The bat.

50:12.968 --> 50:16.513
- Go find my dad.
- Where's the bat?

50:16.597 --> 50:18.807
- See you later, Yankee.
- Where's the bat? Where's the bat?

50:18.891 --> 50:20.225
Thanks, Marti!

50:20.309 --> 50:21.393
Gimme the bat.

52:02.536 --> 52:04.454
Why can't you stay
on your side of the pack?

52:04.538 --> 52:06.790
Because if I stay on that side,
I'll get all wet

52:06.874 --> 52:09.292
- and I don't wanna get all swollen.
- You know, you're right.

52:09.376 --> 52:12.170
- You are getting swollen.
- Where, where?

52:12.254 --> 52:14.756
In your big fat bat head.

52:14.840 --> 52:17.842
Oh, you are gonna get it.
You and that horse you came off of.

52:17.927 --> 52:20.929
Oh, is that a threat?
Give me your best swing.

52:21.013 --> 52:24.390
My best swing,
and your stitches are gonna need stitches.

52:24.475 --> 52:27.977
Will you two just knock it off!

52:29.563 --> 52:32.273
- Well, what's wrong with him?
- I'll tell you what's wrong with him.

52:32.358 --> 52:34.859
He's a ten-year-old kid,
stuck in the middle of nowhere

52:34.944 --> 52:37.570
with a selfish bat
who treats him like a pack mule.

52:37.655 --> 52:40.073
- I do not treat him like a pack mule.
- Oh, yeah?

52:40.157 --> 52:42.158
Ever thank him for saving you from Lefty,

52:42.243 --> 52:44.828
or carting you all the way back
to Chicago?

52:44.912 --> 52:46.287
I...

52:53.921 --> 52:57.006
Yankee, it occurs to me
that I have not properly thanked you

52:57.091 --> 52:59.884
from saving me from that ruffian,
Lefty Maginnis,

52:59.969 --> 53:02.220
and carrying me all this way.

53:02.930 --> 53:06.683
- That's okay.
- No, it most certainly is not.

53:06.767 --> 53:09.853
My mama would just be mortified
at my behavior,

53:09.937 --> 53:13.982
and I just want to tell you how much
I appreciate what you're doing for me.

53:15.484 --> 53:18.987
Yankee, is there something else
bothering you?

53:19.822 --> 53:23.199
- I miss my mom and dad.
- You know what?

53:23.284 --> 53:27.036
Sometimes, Babe misses his family
when he's on the road, too.

53:27.454 --> 53:28.538
Why?

53:28.622 --> 53:32.041
He's surrounded by reporters
and fans and everything.

53:32.126 --> 53:35.378
That's true, but they're not there
'cause they're his friends.

53:35.462 --> 53:38.923
They just hang around 'cause he's famous.

53:39.008 --> 53:42.427
You know something?
You remind me a lot of Babe.

53:42.511 --> 53:45.013
- Oh, please.
- Really?

53:45.097 --> 53:48.808
Oh, yes. You know, I believe
he's gonna like meeting you.

53:49.310 --> 53:50.727
Thanks, Darlin'.

53:50.811 --> 53:53.897
No, no. Thank you, Yankee.

53:53.981 --> 53:57.817
Oh, brother.
You could pour this stuff on pancakes.

54:04.909 --> 54:09.078
It's a home run! The crowd goes wild!

54:09.163 --> 54:11.456
They're going nuts in Chicago!

54:11.540 --> 54:15.168
I'd like to thank
all the little people.

54:15.252 --> 54:17.712
But especially myself!

54:19.590 --> 54:21.674
- What?
- Mr. Cross.

54:23.427 --> 54:26.763
- It's Lefty.
- Lefty, my boy, the plan is working.

54:26.847 --> 54:29.307
The Series is virtually in the bag.

54:29.391 --> 54:31.851
- Where are you?
- Where am I? I'm on the...

54:31.977 --> 54:35.480
I'm on the phone in Toledo, Ohio.

54:35.564 --> 54:38.942
I... I just needed to change trains.

54:39.026 --> 54:41.069
Do you have the at-bay with you?

54:41.153 --> 54:45.031
The bat is...
It's on its way to Chicago, boss.

54:45.115 --> 54:47.283
If the bat's on its way,
but you're in Toledo,

54:47.368 --> 54:50.954
I'm feeling like you're not being
completely honest with me, Lefty.

54:51.038 --> 54:52.497
You don't have the bat, do you?

54:52.581 --> 54:54.666
- I'm... I...
- You moron!

54:54.750 --> 54:56.334
There's one game left in this Series.

54:56.418 --> 55:00.964
If I don't have that bat in my paws
before it starts,

55:01.048 --> 55:04.217
you don't have a job, Lefty. All right?

55:04.301 --> 55:05.468
You know what I think?

55:05.552 --> 55:08.137
- I think there's trouble with this line, boss.
- Hello?

55:08.222 --> 55:10.390
- I think the phone isn't working!
- Operator. Operator?

55:10.474 --> 55:11.599
- Can you hear me, boss?
- Operator.

55:11.684 --> 55:13.810
- Hello! Hello!
- Lefty, hello?

55:15.062 --> 55:17.146
- What a jerk!
- What was that, Lefty?

55:17.231 --> 55:20.358
- I said the phone doesn't work.
- Lefty.

55:20.442 --> 55:21.651
- Work!
- Who has the bat?

55:21.735 --> 55:23.528
- Doesn't work!
- I said who has it, Lefty?

55:23.612 --> 55:25.363
- Work! Work! Work!
- Hello?

55:27.700 --> 55:28.700
Fine.

55:57.771 --> 55:59.856
Would you autograph
my program, please?

55:59.940 --> 56:01.024
Sure thing, miss.

56:01.108 --> 56:02.275
Hey!

56:03.902 --> 56:08.072
Hey, now. Hey. Hello. Oh, hi!

56:08.282 --> 56:13.327
- Hello, thank you so much.
- Hey, bat girl, they're not cheering for you.

56:13.412 --> 56:15.079
Oh, but they should be.

56:15.164 --> 56:18.082
Gee, Mr. Brewster,
would you sign this for us, please?

56:18.167 --> 56:19.333
- Sure. Sure, kids.
- Thank you.

56:19.418 --> 56:21.002
- Yes!
- There you go.

56:21.086 --> 56:22.503
You keep on rooting for us, all right?

56:22.588 --> 56:23.796
- Thank you, Mr. Brewster.
- Thank you.

56:23.881 --> 56:26.966
- See you soon...
- Excuse me, Mr. Brewster?

56:30.637 --> 56:31.888
Cap, let's go.

56:33.140 --> 56:35.349
All right, Hank. All right.

56:35.851 --> 56:38.019
Yankee fan, huh?

56:38.103 --> 56:41.397
Your boys gonna be able
to pull themselves out of the fire?

56:41.482 --> 56:43.900
- What do you mean?
- Yankees lost again last night.

56:43.984 --> 56:46.069
- Got beat bad.
- Oh, no!

56:46.153 --> 56:49.197
- Lost again?
- Yup. The Series is all tied up.

56:49.281 --> 56:51.115
Only one game left.

56:57.581 --> 56:59.499
All right, Willie.
Let's get something going here.

56:59.583 --> 57:01.584
- Watch your head, son.
- Whoa!

57:01.668 --> 57:04.212
I could have caught that
with my eyes closed.

57:11.053 --> 57:12.845
What are they doing?

57:13.013 --> 57:17.141
Oh, my gosh! They're mimes.
Get me out of here.

57:17.226 --> 57:19.685
Never seen anyone
play shadow ball before, huh?

57:19.770 --> 57:22.146
Keeps us on top of our game.

57:22.481 --> 57:27.193
Hey, everybody. This is Yankee Irving
and he's riding with us to Chicago.

57:27.361 --> 57:29.195
How're you doing, Yankee?

57:29.279 --> 57:32.573
- Hey, Willie, are we still playing?
- Yankee here's gonna pinch hit for me.

57:32.658 --> 57:36.619
- You think you can handle it?
- I can hit anything Hank can throw.

57:36.703 --> 57:39.622
Get on up there, hip-pockets.
Welcome to the big leagues, son.

57:39.706 --> 57:41.374
- Batter up.
- Yankee...

57:43.544 --> 57:45.253
Hey, just a minute, y'all.

57:45.379 --> 57:49.423
Look here, son,
your stance has got all kinds of style.

57:49.508 --> 57:52.593
Yeah, you look good.
You just ain't gonna hit nothing.

57:52.678 --> 57:53.970
Half of hittin' is balance.

57:54.054 --> 57:57.056
You get your feet set right and
you could hit anything you can reach.

58:02.729 --> 58:04.313
Keep your knees bent

58:05.232 --> 58:06.899
and your head down.

58:12.072 --> 58:14.115
I'm not sure I can take much more of this.

58:14.199 --> 58:16.742
- Hey, hey.
- Yank's got a baseball right here.

58:17.744 --> 58:19.954
What happened to the invisible ball?

58:22.875 --> 58:24.792
Oh, relax, you knuckle ball.

58:24.877 --> 58:27.670
How can something so round
be so square?

58:29.339 --> 58:33.134
- Whoa!
- Balance, that's the key to hittin' the ball.

58:35.554 --> 58:37.096
Now you're getting it.

58:42.269 --> 58:43.811
Whoa!

58:43.896 --> 58:45.771
I'm afraid of heights!

58:45.939 --> 58:47.940
I got it, I got it, I got it.

58:49.902 --> 58:53.362
That was kind of fun,
but don't do it again, okay?

58:53.447 --> 58:55.698
What am I saying? That was fun.

58:57.159 --> 58:58.701
Whoa! Come on.

59:05.083 --> 59:07.543
Come on, put some pepper on me.

59:08.879 --> 59:12.548
I want more. Give me more!
I'm a screwball!

59:13.800 --> 59:15.968
He looks like a pro.

59:16.094 --> 59:19.513
- Look at you. You've got great form.
- Really?

59:19.848 --> 59:20.932
Look at me, Yank.

59:22.476 --> 59:24.060
Coming through. Look at this.

59:24.144 --> 59:26.896
Yippety-do! Come on, come on, come on.

59:26.980 --> 59:29.065
Okay, now you go ahead,
you show them how to do it.

59:29.149 --> 59:30.191
Here comes the gas.

59:30.275 --> 59:32.401
This is easy. I can do this.

59:33.320 --> 59:37.406
- That's the way you swing it!
- All right. Yeah!

59:37.491 --> 59:40.993
- Did you see me? I did it!
- We're having fun now.

59:41.078 --> 59:42.578
Oh, this boy means business.

59:42.663 --> 59:45.331
This is a little tiny Babe
right here.

01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:24.287
Wow.

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:41.012
Look, son.
The Yankees always stay at this hotel.

01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:42.805
You're gonna be okay here.

01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:44.974
I want you to go inside
and call your daddy.

01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:46.642
I will, Mr. Brewster.

01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:49.145
- And thanks for everything.
- So long, slugger.

01:00:49.229 --> 01:00:51.647
- Bye-bye now, Yankee.
- Bye, guys. See you later.

01:00:51.732 --> 01:00:54.066
I'll be seeing you, hip-pockets.
Take care, kid.

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:55.568
Good luck.

01:00:57.904 --> 01:00:59.196
Oh! Ah!

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:06.162
- Wow.
- Some joint.

01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:10.624
Poor Babe.
He must be devastated without me.

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:14.086
Hey, Babe! Hey, Babe!
Hey, Babe!

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:20.176
Hey, how are you folks? Good to see you.

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.011
Babe Ruth.

01:01:22.095 --> 01:01:25.222
That's Babe!
That's my Babe! Look at Babe!

01:01:25.307 --> 01:01:27.892
Get him to sign me.
Maybe I'll be worth something someday.

01:01:27.976 --> 01:01:30.394
Hey, good to see you.
How've you been?

01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:38.778
Hey, Babe. When are
you Yankees gonna turn it around, huh?

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:42.615
Hey, baseball is full of surprises.
Anything can happen.

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:44.992
Hey, Babe,
smile for the camera.

01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:50.664
I believe the ragamuffin convention
is in the alley behind the hotel.

01:01:50.749 --> 01:01:52.041
But I need to see Babe.

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:56.420
As do several hundred other baseball fans.

01:01:59.466 --> 01:02:01.884
- I thought you said this is...
- Hey.

01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:10.476
Hey, Lou.
Get a load of this kid.

01:02:15.107 --> 01:02:17.525
- You little ruffian!
- I told you...

01:02:17.609 --> 01:02:21.028
- No, no. Let me go. I just got to see Babe.
- This hotel is not for snotty-nosed brats...

01:02:21.113 --> 01:02:23.948
Hey, Mr. D. Bring that kid back over here.

01:02:24.032 --> 01:02:25.741
Hey, kid, you hungry?

01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:34.125
But Mr. Ruth, this hotel
is for guests only.

01:02:34.209 --> 01:02:36.210
Yeah, well, he's my guest.

01:02:36.294 --> 01:02:38.921
- Yes, sir, but...
- Bring him a banana split or something.

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:40.756
- Bring me one, too.
- Hey, what're you doing?

01:02:40.841 --> 01:02:44.093
Hey, oy. Yankee! She, she...

01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:46.429
But she... Darlin'!

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:49.598
Hey, Yankee... Hang on, Darlin'!

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:54.270
This looks like a job for Superball!
Up, up and away!

01:02:54.354 --> 01:02:58.190
- So, what's your name, kid?
- Yankee Irving, sir.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.693
Hey, you got spunk, you know that?

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:04.155
He reminds me of me back in the day.

01:03:04.406 --> 01:03:07.366
Babe, I need to talk to you about Darlin'.

01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:11.454
Well, they don't get it
right in the papers.

01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:14.206
Darlin' and I, we...
We had something special.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.041
You know, kid,
I'd never say this to anyone,

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:19.795
but it was almost like I could tell her
right where I wanted to hit the ball

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.464
and she'd make it happen.

01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:26.010
- Kind of crazy, right?
- Babe, I have Darlin'.

01:03:26.261 --> 01:03:29.722
You have Darlin'?
All right then, hand her over.

01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:33.017
Get your hands off her!

01:03:36.897 --> 01:03:37.980
Ow!

01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:41.525
The dumber they are, the harder they fall.

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:44.403
I was once the prettiest
pine in the forest.

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:48.532
Babe always used to say,
"Darlin' you could be a Christmas tree."

01:03:48.617 --> 01:03:51.577
Beautiful story, princess.
Now let's get out of here.

01:03:53.121 --> 01:03:55.581
You roll, I'll steer.

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:00.127
Huh?

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:06.175
Hey, what is this? Some kind of joke?
That's not my bat.

01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:09.512
And unless you have a pound of roast beef,
that's not even lunch.

01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:13.933
Babe, I just had her.
She was right here in my backpack.

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:16.185
Lefty Maginnis stole her.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:19.146
I brought her all the way back here
from New York.

01:04:19.231 --> 01:04:20.773
I got to find her.

01:04:22.108 --> 01:04:23.817
Just roll... Just...

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:27.363
- Yank.
- Darlin'!

01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:29.990
- Hurry, Yank.
- You got to get... You!

01:04:30.075 --> 01:04:31.200
Hello.

01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:35.454
Help! Help!

01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:38.582
Help!

01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:51.637
- Help! Help!
- Drive the car!

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.570
So tragic.
The indomitable, the unflappable,

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:12.992
the amazing Babe Ruth's last turn at plate
and no magic bat to rely on.

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:14.952
Will he go down in three pitches,
do you think?

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:19.540
- Yank, don't listen to him.
- Yeah. He's just an angry little troll.

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:22.418
He doesn't need a magic bat.

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:26.088
Really? And yet you tried so hard
to return it to him.

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:29.341
What do you say we listen to the radio
and see what's happening?

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:32.928
And it looks like the Cubs
have the Championship in the bag.

01:05:33.013 --> 01:05:35.556
The Yankees trail the Cubs
six to nothing with no men on...

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:37.474
- Come on, Babe.
- Babe Ruth is at the plate.

01:05:37.559 --> 01:05:38.726
Come on.

01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:43.063
Here's the pitch. Swing, and strike three.

01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:45.482
That's going to send Babe
back to the bench.

01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:46.609
Oh, my Babe.

01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:50.070
Which now looks more like
a funeral parlor. The Yankees look beat,

01:05:50.155 --> 01:05:52.573
and with only two outs to go,
they probably are.

01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:56.827
Well, I believe that's gonna do it
for your Yankees, Yankee.

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:05.628
Oh... I suppose
this bat's not much of a threat now.

01:06:05.712 --> 01:06:08.714
I hope you get splinters everywhere.

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:10.883
Of course there's always next year.

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:12.718
Maybe I'll take her
to my cabin on the lake.

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:16.096
There're some beavers there
that'd love to make her acquaintance.

01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:17.473
Give it a little nibble.

01:06:20.518 --> 01:06:24.688
I suppose I should be heading down to the
field to accept my World Series trophy.

01:06:24.773 --> 01:06:26.815
You just stay put, little Yankee.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.777
I'm sure your parents have given up
looking for you by now.

01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:32.655
The orphanage should be here any minute
to pick you up.

01:06:32.739 --> 01:06:33.864
Just walk in saying,

01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:37.368
"I'm the boy who lost Babe Ruth's bat
and cost him the World Series.

01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:39.370
"How're you folks doing?"

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:45.125
Sleep on that, Yankee.

01:06:50.799 --> 01:06:52.800
So what's the plan, Yank?

01:06:52.884 --> 01:06:55.719
- There is no plan, Screwie.
- You mean we're winging it?

01:06:55.804 --> 01:06:58.222
- Great. What do we do first?
- Nothing.

01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:02.351
There is nothing we can do.
Don't you get it? It's over.

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:04.645
Babe struck out. We failed.

01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:07.856
You were right, Screwie. I'm just a kid.

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:11.235
I should have just quit.

01:07:11.486 --> 01:07:14.321
That's it? You're laying down your bat?

01:07:14.406 --> 01:07:16.657
You know, when I landed in that sandlot,

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:20.411
I thought, "That's it.
There's nothing left to do but rot."

01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:22.287
But then you came along.

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:24.540
And there was all this...
This jumping on trains,

01:07:24.624 --> 01:07:28.335
and the thing with the apples
and playing ball with the Tigers.

01:07:29.254 --> 01:07:31.171
You made a believer out of me.

01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:34.425
I wasn't right, kid. Not at all.

01:07:34.843 --> 01:07:38.220
So what, the Yankees lose a game?
Is that why you did this?

01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:40.931
So Babe can set his millionth record?

01:07:41.015 --> 01:07:45.853
Did Babe teach you how to throw?
Is Babe gonna pay your family's rent?

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:49.148
Why did you do this, Yankee? Why?

01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:54.903
- To help my dad.
- Then the game's not over, Yankee.

01:07:55.238 --> 01:07:57.656
Are you gonna keep swingin'?

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:05.456
I thought baseball
was a field of broken dreams.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:10.335
I'm not talking about baseball.
I'm talking about family.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.886
- Darlin', we gotta...
- I heard everything he said.

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:24.183
Yankee, I would be honored to help save
your Daddy's job.

01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:27.935
And here I thought you were
a hard-hearted old crank.

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:29.979
- All right...
- And now I come to find out

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:33.734
that under that tough leather shell
is just a gooey caramel center.

01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:36.403
- Enough already.
- Fine.

01:08:36.488 --> 01:08:39.990
Unless, of course,
you've got something else you wanna say.

01:08:40.073 --> 01:08:42.033
You did good, baseball.

01:08:43.745 --> 01:08:45.162
Thanks, bat.

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:49.249
- So how're we getting out of here?
- The window.

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:56.215
- It doesn't open.
- Don't you get it? Baseball. Window.

01:08:56.424 --> 01:08:58.300
Smasharoonie.

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:02.805
Screwie, are you sure?

01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:05.307
Look at me.
I'm covered in stitches already.

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:08.727
Now, let's smash some glass!

01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:17.653
Okay, I think
we're softening up the glass a little.

01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:18.779
Try again.

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:25.618
Play ball!

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:32.125
Screwie, where are you?

01:09:35.712 --> 01:09:38.841
Don't worry about me. Get to the Babe.
I'll be all right.

01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:40.384
Hey, a foul ball.

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:42.426
I just can't shake that, can I?

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:45.221
Whoa!
Hey, watch it, watch it! Hey!

01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:47.558
Whoa!

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:11.874
You see, baseball is about teamwork,
a certain level of dignity...

01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:12.958
What the?

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:14.418
Hey, kid!
Stop that kid.

01:10:14.502 --> 01:10:15.544
Don't go down there.

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:17.296
Lou, that kid, I... I know that kid.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.673
You remember that kid. That's the...
That, that... It's that kid.

01:10:19.757 --> 01:10:20.799
Wait a minute.

01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:22.968
There seems to be some sort of
commotion developing in the stands.

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:24.344
The ushers are chasing someone
through the crowd.

01:10:24.429 --> 01:10:26.263
I can't quite see who it is.

01:10:26.347 --> 01:10:31.810
Well, the ushers appear to be chasing
a boy carrying a baseball bat.

01:10:32.103 --> 01:10:35.063
He looks to be about 10 years old.
He's wearing a Yankees baseball cap,

01:10:36.274 --> 01:10:37.816
And let me tell you, folks,

01:10:37.901 --> 01:10:40.527
he's really giving the Cubs personnel
a run for their money.

01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:45.157
Hey, kid!

01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:50.329
Strike three! What the hey?

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:52.080
- Move! Move!
- Come on! Come on!

01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:53.582
Aren't you playing, huh, Yank?

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:55.459
Hey, kid. What are you doing here?

01:10:55.543 --> 01:10:57.920
Come here, get off the field!

01:10:58.004 --> 01:11:00.255
- I just need to get this to Babe.
- Hey, hey.

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:02.299
Hey, what're you trying to do?

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:07.971
Well, well, well. I'm...
It's really my Darlin'.

01:11:08.056 --> 01:11:11.475
- It's my Babe.
- Babe, here she is.

01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:15.062
- Just like I told you.
- No! Stop! Umpire.

01:11:15.146 --> 01:11:20.108
I demand you call this game immediately,
if not sooner, 'cause of shenanigans.

01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:24.321
Yeah, not so fast, short stuff.
Your man Lefty stole my bat.

01:11:24.405 --> 01:11:25.614
Is that your bat? I didn't...

01:11:25.698 --> 01:11:27.324
- Tell him, Babe. You tell him.
- What?

01:11:27.408 --> 01:11:29.451
That's the most absurd thing
I've ever heard!

01:11:29.535 --> 01:11:31.662
Isn't that a penalty?
Shouldn't they forfeit?

01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:34.957
Yankees, you got two minutes
to get your batter in the box

01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:36.166
or you'll forfeit the game.

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:39.378
All right, right.
Hold your... Hold your horses.

01:11:39.879 --> 01:11:42.381
- It's not okay. We're in bad shape.
- Yankee. Yankee.

01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:44.758
Do you notice where you're standing, boy?

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.887
Home plate in the middle
of the World Series.

01:11:49.097 --> 01:11:51.306
Now how does that feel, slugger?

01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:53.892
You're looking good, Yankee.

01:11:54.394 --> 01:11:56.979
- Don't you think so, Babe? Babe? Babe!
- Darlin'.

01:11:57.063 --> 01:11:58.772
- Big man, look over here!
- Darlin'.

01:11:58.856 --> 01:12:01.400
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling to Babe.

01:12:01.567 --> 01:12:05.237
Yeah, look at this team.
We look like we're already beat.

01:12:05.363 --> 01:12:08.490
Who can we put at the plate
that will set this place on its ear?

01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:11.326
Keep this team from
throwing in the towel.

01:12:11.411 --> 01:12:13.245
Look at the boy
standing on home plate.

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:15.497
Ain't he something? Listen.

01:12:15.957 --> 01:12:18.500
Hey! You hear me talking to you?

01:12:18.584 --> 01:12:21.294
- Huh?
- Why don't you put him in the game?

01:12:21.796 --> 01:12:23.880
Babe, look at us.

01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:28.135
I know who's gonna bat. Him.

01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:31.847
Babe, forget it. This isn't Little League.
It's the World Series.

01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:33.265
He's just a kid.

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:36.768
This kid brought Darlin' from New York
to Chicago all by himself.

01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:39.146
If he can do that, he can do anything.

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:43.483
Come on, guys. This is baseball.
Anything can happen.

01:12:43.568 --> 01:12:45.152
What do you say?

01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:46.528
Hmm.

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:50.198
All right, Yankees. Time's up.
Who's your hitter?

01:12:50.283 --> 01:12:52.534
- Him. There's our hitter.
- Huh?

01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:54.369
- What?
- Play ball!

01:12:54.454 --> 01:12:56.747
I... I don't know about this.

01:12:56.831 --> 01:13:00.834
You are about to bat in the World Series!

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:06.631
I guess you guys really are desperate.

01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:16.141
I know, I have no strike zone,
so don't swing.

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:20.187
Of course you swing.
Here, you can use my Darlin'.

01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:22.939
But, Babe,
nobody's ever used Darlin' but you.

01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:24.066
Yeah, well...

01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:29.362
I don't want her to hear this,
but it's not really the bat,

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:31.239
it's the batter.

01:13:32.325 --> 01:13:33.992
Now go get them, kid.

01:13:34.994 --> 01:13:36.661
So what's happening? What did I miss?

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:39.206
- Yankee's gonna pinch hit.
- What?

01:13:40.041 --> 01:13:43.210
I mean, what a great idea! Wow!

01:13:43.294 --> 01:13:46.379
Who came up with that one?
Because that's a beauty, boy.

01:13:46.464 --> 01:13:49.257
- Screwie!
- You can do it, Yankee,

01:13:49.342 --> 01:13:51.885
and I'll be right here the whole time
to talk you through it.

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:53.136
Batter up!

01:13:53.221 --> 01:13:56.598
Whoa! Scratch that.
I'll be right here.

01:13:59.227 --> 01:14:02.270
I thought it was supposed to be Babe,
not a baby.

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:04.523
Well, sports fans,
the Yankees have put

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:07.109
a 10-year-old boy in as the pinch hitter.

01:14:07.193 --> 01:14:08.985
- A boy? What, are they kidding?
- Oh, I'm being given a name

01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:10.362
for the young rookie.

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:13.448
- It's Yankee Irving.
- Yankee Irving?

01:14:13.533 --> 01:14:18.245
Now batting for the New York Yankees,
number one, Yankee Irving.

01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:20.956
- That's my boy!
- Yankee?

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.834
They're putting him in the game.
Yankee. Yankee.

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:31.133
Okay, Lefty, all you have to do
is strike the kid out.

01:14:31.217 --> 01:14:32.425
Just finish it!

01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:37.013
Okay, kid, you're about to lose
a whole lot of baby teeth.

01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:43.019
Settle in, Yank. You can do this!

01:14:46.816 --> 01:14:49.109
Don't just stand there, you gotta swing.

01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:51.153
Strike one!

01:14:51.237 --> 01:14:54.072
Okay, now you know
he's throwing strikes. Be ready.

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:55.991
He can do it.

01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:06.084
Watch me, now, watch me!
Curveball! Curveball! Swing!

01:15:06.544 --> 01:15:08.753
- Strike two!
- Darn!

01:15:09.255 --> 01:15:12.090
Come on now, sugar.
I cannot swing myself.

01:15:12.175 --> 01:15:13.258
Yank!
Yankee.

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:15.302
Yankee, we're here!
We're here!

01:15:15.386 --> 01:15:16.887
- Yank!
- Yank, we're here!

01:15:16.971 --> 01:15:18.597
Mom? Dad?

01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:21.099
- Just swing!
- Just swing!

01:15:30.568 --> 01:15:34.154
You get your feet set right,
you can hit anything you can reach.

01:15:34.238 --> 01:15:36.656
Keep your eye on the ball.

01:15:37.074 --> 01:15:41.453
If Babe can do it, so can you.

01:15:42.622 --> 01:15:46.124
- Oh, my.
- Time for the booger ball.

01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:59.596
I can't believe you just blew
your nose on me.

01:16:02.642 --> 01:16:04.351
Come on, Yankee.

01:16:08.981 --> 01:16:11.149
Take your time. Focus!

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.242
Uh-oh.

01:16:21.702 --> 01:16:25.622
I'm going! I'm going! I'm not going.

01:16:28.084 --> 01:16:29.251
Run!

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:32.754
And he hit it!
The kid hit the ball!

01:16:32.838 --> 01:16:34.089
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:16:34.173 --> 01:16:36.549
It's a short blooper
and Irving is sprinting to first base!

01:16:36.634 --> 01:16:39.177
I said I got it.

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:43.431
It sails right past Taylor,
the first baseman.

01:16:43.641 --> 01:16:45.892
Go for second! Go for second!

01:16:45.977 --> 01:16:48.979
Irving rounds first base
as Taylor and Cuyler chase it down.

01:16:49.855 --> 01:16:51.314
Slide, Yankee!

01:16:51.399 --> 01:16:53.817
Irving is rounding second
and is barreling towards third,

01:16:53.901 --> 01:16:55.944
but I don't think he's
gonna make it, folks.

01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:58.738
- Go, Yankee, go!
- Come on, Yankee! Go!

01:16:58.823 --> 01:17:00.448
Move it! Move it!

01:17:01.284 --> 01:17:05.870
Lefty Maginnis is covering... Holy cow!

01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:08.456
- Irving just...
- Look at that kid go, huh?

01:17:08.541 --> 01:17:10.500
- Come on, Yankee!
- Go, Yankee, go!

01:17:10.584 --> 01:17:12.544
Oh, this is gonna be close, folks.

01:17:12.628 --> 01:17:15.630
Hedley has come up with the ball
and looks to home plate.

01:17:15.715 --> 01:17:18.842
- The fun's over, you little runt!
- Trip him! Somebody!

01:17:18.926 --> 01:17:21.803
- The boy is not slowing down!
- Not this time, punk!

01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:23.054
Slide!

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:27.475
Or not slide!

01:17:34.734 --> 01:17:35.775
Safe!

01:17:36.944 --> 01:17:38.737
- Way to go!
- All right, Yankee!

01:17:38.821 --> 01:17:40.322
How about that kid, huh?

01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:42.949
Oh, no! No!

01:17:43.034 --> 01:17:44.868
That's a little Tiger if I ever seen one.

01:17:44.952 --> 01:17:47.370
He did it! That's my Yankee!

01:17:47.455 --> 01:17:50.915
Yankee! Yankee! Yankee!

01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:53.168
Hey, Yank! We're coming down!
We're coming down!

01:17:53.252 --> 01:17:54.502
That's my friend!

01:17:54.587 --> 01:17:55.879
Ow! Ow!

01:17:56.756 --> 01:17:58.089
Oh, that's me.

01:18:02.219 --> 01:18:05.764
- We did it, Darlin'.
- No, you did it.

01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:07.557
Like Babe said,

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:10.769
"It's not the bat, it's the batter."

01:18:11.437 --> 01:18:14.272
Listen to them, kid! They love you!

01:18:14.357 --> 01:18:16.733
They're cheering for you, too, Screwie!

01:18:16.859 --> 01:18:20.070
Can you believe it? I'm a home run ball!

01:18:20.321 --> 01:18:22.155
Yahoo!

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:24.866
You always were.

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:29.496
Way to go, kid.

01:18:33.793 --> 01:18:35.126
Thanks, Babe.

01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:39.047
Yankee.
Yankee.

01:18:39.173 --> 01:18:40.632
- Yankee.
- Yankee.

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.386
Mom! Dad!

01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:49.391
- I did it, Dad. I did it.
- I always knew you could do it.

01:18:49.475 --> 01:18:52.602
- You just kept swinging.
- Just like you taught me, Dad.

01:18:54.438 --> 01:18:58.691
Yankee's home run sparked
the New York rally that scored seven runs.

01:18:58.776 --> 01:19:00.902
Babe himself drove in four.

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:02.987
And when the Cubs came to bat,

01:19:03.197 --> 01:19:07.909
they went down, one, two, three.
Just like that.

01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:10.370
The Yankees won the World Series.

01:19:10.788 --> 01:19:12.497
And it just goes to show you,

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:14.916
you can be the smallest,
you can be the weakest,

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.377
you can be the worst player on the field,

01:19:17.461 --> 01:19:21.089
but when people tell you you're no good,
and say you should give it up,

01:19:21.173 --> 01:19:22.924
you know what you do?

01:19:23.008 --> 01:19:25.260
You just keep on swinging.

01:19:30.933 --> 01:19:33.518
- Hello!
- Hey!

01:19:46.699 --> 01:19:47.782
Yeah!

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:50.118
Uh-oh.

01:20:04.592 --> 01:20:05.842
All right, all right. That's enough.

01:20:05.926 --> 01:20:09.053
All right, Yankee.
That's enough, that's enough.
