ANDY: <i>Previously on </i>NYPD Blue.

00:02.836 --> 00:05.422
Before you get going,
I have a quick announcement to make.

00:05.797 --> 00:08.800
I’m putting in my papers for retirement.
I’m leaving the job.

00:08.967 --> 00:11.636
And this is 'cause you got dropped
the list for captain’s pay?

00:11.761 --> 00:13.888
It all tells me I’m not getting
any further on the job.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.223
That’s a punk move.

00:15.390 --> 00:18.560
Never once in my life
have I punked out of anything.

00:18.768 --> 00:21.062
I gave the department everything
for 18 years.

00:21.229 --> 00:23.398
I took a bullet and they let me down.

00:23.481 --> 00:27.235
If you cared about this job,
if it had any meaning to you at all,

00:27.360 --> 00:29.279
you’d turn it back on them and fight.

00:41.666 --> 00:42.876
Okay, thanks.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.795
Alex Palmer, out for his morning run,
shot in the neck.

00:46.337 --> 00:49.799
That’s his wife. Uniform says
he called her from his cell

00:49.924 --> 00:52.260
-before he went out of the picture.
-Is she the one that called it in?

00:52.343 --> 00:53.470
As same time as this guy.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.597
He’s English, on vacation
with his parents.

00:55.722 --> 00:56.765
All right, we’ll take him.

00:56.848 --> 00:58.183
-I’ll talk to the wife.
-Yeah.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.270
-Excuse me, detectives Sipowicz and Clark.
-Ian Braithwaite.

01:02.562 --> 01:05.273
First, someone tried to steal
my mum’s purse,

01:05.482 --> 01:09.110
and then a cabbie charges us 80 dollars
to go across town and now this.

01:09.277 --> 01:10.361
Tell us what happened.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.322
We’re walking from the hotel
to catch the subway

01:12.405 --> 01:14.699
to go to Ground Zero
when we heard the shot.

01:14.824 --> 01:15.950
And what they say is true.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.703
I... It very much does sound
like when a car backfires.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.246
Did you see anything?

01:20.413 --> 01:24.542
No. So we kept walking,
and that’s when we saw the poor chap.

01:24.626 --> 01:27.212
I thought New York was safer nowadays. No?

01:27.337 --> 01:30.131
-How much longer you gonna be in town?
-Three more days. Scheduled.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.383
Though we may leave earlier now
for obvious reasons.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.219
-Did you get his information?
-Mm-hmm.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.137
All right, we may be in touch
if we have any more questions.

01:36.846 --> 01:38.598
Too many guns in your country, yes?

01:38.932 --> 01:41.184
-Well, thanks for your help.
-Cheers.

01:43.019 --> 01:44.020
"Cheers?"

01:45.230 --> 01:49.734
-So, your husband was able to call you?
-He said he’d been shot and to call 911.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.486
Did he tell you anything else?

01:52.278 --> 01:54.280
He loved me. That’s it.

01:55.031 --> 01:59.285
Kelly, was your husband having problems
with anyone? Male or female?

01:59.661 --> 02:03.957
After the internet took a dive,
Alex had a lot of clients that lost money.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.334
Lost their whole savings and...

02:06.417 --> 02:09.838
I know he got some angry calls,
but it wasn’t Alex’s fault.

02:10.046 --> 02:12.215
Anyone at Alex’s work
who could help us out with that?

02:12.841 --> 02:17.137
His partner at Meridian Money Management,
Gavin McCulloch.

02:17.887 --> 02:22.433
Alex worked a lot of hours. (CRIES)
He was trying to be...

02:23.476 --> 02:24.769
Do you want to take a few minutes?

02:25.937 --> 02:27.397
Do you want me to stay here with you?

02:27.480 --> 02:29.274
-Yes.
-All right.

02:29.482 --> 02:30.692
I can’t believe it.

(CHUCKLES) I don’t mean to appear maudlin,

02:39.826 --> 02:41.953
but, um no one’s going
to believe me back home.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.580
It would mean a great deal to me

02:43.746 --> 02:45.957
if I could have my picture taken
with you both.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.424
We pulled him over for running a light.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.052
Popped the trunk when we saw
the ignition punched out.

04:21.302 --> 04:22.303

04:27.600 --> 04:30.103
-A Samuel Rubicoff.
-That’s him.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.981
-BALDWIN: What’s this guy saying?
-That he borrowed the car from a friend.

04:33.815 --> 04:34.857
Uh-huh.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.902
-Your name?
-Peter Warren.

04:38.194 --> 04:40.780
And guys, being upfront here,
being honest,

04:40.905 --> 04:42.240
I don’t know a thing about that body.

04:42.782 --> 04:43.783
Come here.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.495
Let’s work backward
from the stolen car you were driving.

04:47.578 --> 04:49.330
-I told the cop.
-Yeah, we heard, you borrowed it

04:49.414 --> 04:51.040
from a friend.
Now, the name of the friend?

04:51.416 --> 04:53.126

Mr. Um... That’s the best can you do?

04:57.005 --> 04:58.589
With a murdered guy in your trunk?

04:59.090 --> 05:01.509
Okay, look, I stole the car. I admit that.

05:01.634 --> 05:04.053
The first I saw that dead guy
was when that cop popped the trunk.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.972
You know, there's a lot of ways to prove
you’re lying.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.849
If any of your clothes fibers
are on the DOA,

05:07.932 --> 05:09.434

is in that car...

05:09.517 --> 05:10.768
I swear, I swear.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.645
All right, where did you steal
the car from?

05:12.770 --> 05:14.856
A parking lot under the Brooklyn Bridge
on the Manhattan side.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.316
-When?
-Like an hour ago.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.775
Yeah, but like every other car thief
in the world,

05:17.859 --> 05:18.901
you didn’t bother checking the trunk.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.194
I hadn’t got to it yet.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.446
Last chance here, Peter.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.698
Look, ask around.
You say the name Peter Warren,

05:23.865 --> 05:25.700
people will say car thief, not killer.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.452
You understand we can’t take
your word on that.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.455
-I swear to you, I swear to you.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.804
What’s up with the DOA jogger?

05:46.971 --> 05:49.932
It doesn’t look like a robbery.
So, figure somebody’s gunning for him.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.726
Nothing on the canvass.

05:51.893 --> 05:55.188

no affairs, no money problems.

06:31.682 --> 06:32.975
-Yeah.
-Andy.

What? I hope it works out for the guy.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.772
Why don’t you mind your own business
over there, huh?

06:37.897 --> 06:40.066
"Hope it works out" sounds like
you don’t think it will.

06:40.358 --> 06:41.859
Well, if I would’ve thought that,
I would have wrote it.

06:42.026 --> 06:43.194

be framing this thing.

-Thank you.
-Yeah.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.929
-This is so devastating.
-We’re very sorry.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.181
I mean, just devastating.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.725
-How long did you and Alex work together?
-GAVIN: Eight years.

07:15.059 --> 07:18.020
We had desks across from each other
at Lion McNichol.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.398
We both wanted out,
so we hung up our shingle.

07:20.731 --> 07:22.400
-How’s business been?
-Great.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.902
We’re managing
120-million-dollar portfolio.

07:25.445 --> 07:29.031
-Did I hear correctly that Alex was shot?
-That’s right.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.701
-And it wasn’t a robbery?
-Doesn’t look like it.

07:31.826 --> 07:35.121
Alex’s wife mentioned something
about disgruntled investors

07:35.204 --> 07:37.957
over that whole internet pipe dream
a few years back.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.168
No one has made any threats
or behaved in a way

07:40.251 --> 07:41.419
that would raise a flag.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.338
So, are you thinking this was
a random killing or...

07:44.547 --> 07:48.009
-It doesn’t look random.
-Any leads, witnesses, anything?

07:48.217 --> 07:50.636
Did you have something to do
with Alex’s murder, Mr. McCulloch?

07:51.345 --> 07:54.140
Oh, my God. Absolutely not.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.434
Then, why are you feeling us out
for what we know about the case?

07:56.767 --> 08:00.771
-I... I didn’t realize I was doing that.
-ANDY: You are, and people who do that

08:01.022 --> 08:03.441
usually have something more
on their mind than just grief.

08:03.774 --> 08:06.736
What’s going on, hmm?
What do you know that we don’t?

08:07.236 --> 08:10.823
(CLEARS THROAT) I... I suppose the reason
I was asking was

08:11.032 --> 08:12.825
because if it was a random robbery,

08:12.950 --> 08:17.455
there would be no need to pry
into certain personal aspects of his life.

08:17.538 --> 08:20.124
Did Alex owe money?
Was he screwing around on his wife?

08:20.208 --> 08:24.045
He was deeply in love with Kelly.
I mean, they were college sweethearts.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.757
And for as long as I’ve known him,
Alex has been the ideal husband.

08:28.758 --> 08:34.013
But... as you may know,
many relationships... stagnate.

08:34.096 --> 08:36.265
No offense, Mr. McCulloch,
but you’re not in church, okay?

08:36.349 --> 08:38.351
So, you don’t need to apologize
for anybody’s behavior,

08:38.434 --> 08:39.852
just tell us what Alex was up to.

08:40.561 --> 08:43.272
He never told me anything about her
other than they met at a coffee shop

08:43.356 --> 08:45.441
six months ago, and she was married also.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.610
All he asked me to do is to cover for him

08:47.693 --> 08:51.197
when he needed an excuse some nights,
and... I did.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.032
When was the last time
you covered for him?

08:53.366 --> 08:55.535
-A week ago.
-Alex ever mention a name?

08:55.826 --> 08:58.371
Janet. And when I heard
what happened this morning,

08:58.454 --> 09:02.124
the first thing I thought of was,
"I hope it wasn’t this woman’s husband."

09:02.542 --> 09:04.919
Uh, before I came over,
I went through his call sheet,

09:05.002 --> 09:07.505
and I found a Janet Grafton
and this number.

09:07.588 --> 09:10.424
-I’m assuming that’s her.
-We’ll look into it.

09:12.176 --> 09:16.055
Alex’s wife, Kelly,
she’s already been through enough.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.390
We’ll do our best.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.850
But just so you know,
when somebody gets murdered,

09:19.934 --> 09:21.811
this type of information
usually comes out.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.067
LOIS: How the hell someone
could do something like this to Sammy

09:28.150 --> 09:29.652
is beyond comprehension.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.070
When’s the last time you saw him?

09:31.279 --> 09:35.116
I head out around two.
He generally locks up around four, 4:30.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.159
-Anyone else usually with him?
-No.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.203
Was your husband having trouble
with anyone?

09:39.328 --> 09:41.330
-No.
-Financial difficulties?

09:41.497 --> 09:43.207
-No.
-Were you privy to the bookkeeping?

09:43.332 --> 09:45.418
I do the books, sweetheart.
we’re in the black.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.253
Well, we made some calls on the way over,

09:47.336 --> 09:50.256
and we, uh, we heard that cops responded
to a disturbance here last week?

09:50.506 --> 09:53.801
(CHUCKLES) That was just a bunch of comics
showing their more pleasant side.

09:54.635 --> 09:55.636
Specifically, though?

09:56.262 --> 09:58.639
We used to lay out cold cuts
for whoever’d perform.

09:58.889 --> 10:01.017
For some of them,
it was the only meal of the day.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.936
So fine, but then they started
lining their pockets.

10:04.353 --> 10:05.521
With cold cuts?

10:05.688 --> 10:07.690
And steaks from the fridge
and chicken breasts,

10:07.773 --> 10:09.775
and coming in on days
they weren’t performing.

10:10.526 --> 10:13.279
-So, Sammy had to put his foot down.
-How did the comedians react?

10:13.529 --> 10:16.657
(CHUCKLES) Like the children they are.
A lot of noise.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.118
-BALDWIN: Did anyone make threats?
-Nothing special.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.455
But still, your husband was having trouble
with some people?

10:22.663 --> 10:24.582
You see, just a minute ago,
you said that...

10:24.665 --> 10:25.916
LOIS: I know what I said.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.253
Sammy just had to wrap their knuckles.
That’s all it was.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.631
-BALDWIN: Then why did the cops respond?
-It moved outside,

10:31.881 --> 10:34.467
and the old bat that lives upstairs
called 911.

10:34.550 --> 10:36.385
Was there a ringleader of the comics?

10:36.969 --> 10:37.970
Not that I remember.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.181
Well, any one of them who would
take more than the others

10:40.264 --> 10:41.265
or more often?

10:41.557 --> 10:44.143
They’re all equally drunk, broke,
and desperate. (CHUCKLES)

10:44.518 --> 10:46.437
Well, you got a list
of the next performance?

10:46.520 --> 10:47.563
Of course.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.779
Sammy was like a father to these kids.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.782
Sometimes stern,
but only when he had to be.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.408
And always fair.

11:00.701 --> 11:01.911
He was a loved man.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.832
(CRIES, SNIFFLES)

11:08.459 --> 11:09.502
(SIGHS)

11:10.419 --> 11:14.965
I was thinking of peppering my comments
to the lieutenant tonight with some jokes.

11:15.549 --> 11:17.385
Yeah? Don’t.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.847
-Keep it short and sweet?
-There you go.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.107
Sarge told us to put these
in the lieutenant’s office.

11:31.273 --> 11:32.858
Yeah, he called. In here.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.902
Who'd the sarge say dropped them off?

11:35.027 --> 11:37.029
Said they were left with the new PAA.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.365
Guy just said he was the new CO
in the squad,

11:39.448 --> 11:41.075
and he’d be back with the rest
of his stuff.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.661
-You gonna open them?
-We’ll know soon enough whose they are.

11:43.994 --> 11:46.455
Did you get in touch with Janet Grafton,
the DOA’s girlfriend?

11:46.539 --> 11:48.040
Yeah, she got our message.
She’s coming in.

11:48.290 --> 11:49.583
Hey boss, I talked to the uniforms

11:49.792 --> 11:52.128
who responded to the dispute
at the Laugh Pit last week.

11:52.211 --> 11:55.464
They said a Lonnie Cutler was real vocal
and made threats to our DOA.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.758
Doesn’t that contradict
what our DOA’s wife said?

11:57.967 --> 11:59.885
Did you just say Lonnie Cutler?

11:59.969 --> 12:02.930
Yeah. He’s got some criminal history,
drunk in public.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.182
Anything on the guy who stole the car,
Peter Warren?

12:05.474 --> 12:07.143
Crime Scene got a bunch of lifts
off the trunk,

12:07.226 --> 12:09.603
but none from Warren
and no blood on his clothes.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.147
Get this Cutler in.

12:11.522 --> 12:14.358
Yeah, with pleasure. He’s genius.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.610
Funniest comic I’ve ever seen.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.864
-Oh, this is gonna be fun.
-Come on, Greg.

12:25.536 --> 12:28.038
-Detective Sipowicz or Clark?
-Yeah.

12:28.456 --> 12:31.083
-Janet Grafton, you called me in.
-You’re a cop.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.918
Eight years. What’s up?

12:33.836 --> 12:35.713
(SIGHS) Let’s talk in here.

12:36.672 --> 12:37.882
Wait, what’s it about?

12:39.633 --> 12:42.428
Alex Palmer. If you wanna talk out here,
we can.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.278
So, how do you know Alex Palmer?

12:59.653 --> 13:02.114
I’m gonna ask nicely here,
don’t try to work me.

13:02.406 --> 13:03.657
Can you just tell me what’s going on?

13:03.908 --> 13:06.076
Sure. Alex was shot to death this morning.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.165
(SIGHS)

13:13.042 --> 13:15.878
His buddy said he was having
an affair with a girl named Janet.

13:16.003 --> 13:18.380
Your name was on his call list at work.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.174
That’s what’s going on.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.511
What do you have so far,
who killed him?

13:24.136 --> 13:25.137
Nothing.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.931
How long you and Alex
been seeing each other?

13:28.265 --> 13:29.308
Janet?

13:29.892 --> 13:34.605
(SNIFFLES) Uh... six months or so.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.441
He was a really sweet guy.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.361
He ever confide any problems to you,
tell you he was in trouble?

13:40.569 --> 13:41.946
(SIGHS) No, nothing like that.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.156
When was the last time
you saw each other?

13:45.241 --> 13:47.576
Um, Monday.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.203
No, Sunday.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.455
I’m sorry.
I’m just kind of thrown by this.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.957
ANDY: I see you’ve got a ring on.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.875
Your husband know
you’ve been stepping out?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.461
No. And he’s not my husband.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.297
-I mean, not like that. We’re separated.
-You sure about that?

14:00.589 --> 14:03.175
Yeah, Scott won’t give me
a divorce or move out.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.760
We pretty much lead separate lives.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.596
If you don’t believe me,
you can ask my divorce lawyer.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.807
-The ring says different.
-JANET: Yeah, well, I wear this

14:10.015 --> 14:11.600
'cause he sees me without it, he goes off.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.352
I don’t need the aggravation.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.938
He didn’t find out about this affair
and go off on you then?

14:16.188 --> 14:17.189
No.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.108
Is he on the job?

14:20.192 --> 14:22.111
He works out of the 2-5.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.488
(SIGHS) Were you and Alex
still seeing each other?

14:24.613 --> 14:27.199
How about asking me
if I know anything about Alex’s death,

14:27.324 --> 14:29.159
so I can say no
and we can be done with this?

14:29.243 --> 14:32.872
-Were you still seeing each other?
-No. I broke it off. It was time.

14:33.914 --> 14:37.126
It had nothing to do
with your, uh, your jealous husband

14:37.209 --> 14:38.961
who’s a cop and he carries a gun?

14:40.004 --> 14:41.589
You asked us to be upfront
with you, right?

14:42.214 --> 14:44.174
Okay. So, how about a little
reciprocation?

14:44.884 --> 14:48.012
(SNIFFLES) I just copped
to having an affair to you guys.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.555
Alex wasn’t robbed,

14:49.722 --> 14:52.182
somebody put a bullet
in his head and disappeared.

14:52.349 --> 14:53.851
Did your husband find out
about the affair?

14:54.143 --> 14:56.812
No. I mean, he accused me before, but...

14:56.896 --> 14:57.938
JOHN: Did he ever threaten you?

14:58.063 --> 14:59.982
Say what would happen
if he caught you with someone else?

15:00.107 --> 15:01.317
What do you want me to say?

15:01.567 --> 15:02.943
ANDY: We’re gonna need to talk
to your husband,

15:03.193 --> 15:04.862
grab a cup of coffee till we get back.

15:05.112 --> 15:07.448
If Scott alibi’s straight off then,

15:07.615 --> 15:09.533
there’s no need to bring up
me and Alex, right?

15:09.742 --> 15:10.826
We’ll do our best.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.620
JANET: But I mean, if it comes down to it,

15:12.828 --> 15:14.622
could Scott hear it from me first?

15:14.830 --> 15:17.750
No. we’ll call when we’re done
talking with him.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.502
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

15:21.003 --> 15:24.548
No. I wanna walk across
the parking lot with, uh...

15:24.757 --> 15:27.301
I don’t know. It was some obscene
title you mentioned.

15:27.384 --> 15:29.970
<i>-Good Will Humping.</i>
-(LAUGHS) I was dying.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.513
LONNIE: That’s my best stuff.

15:31.847 --> 15:34.975
So Lonnie, how you get along
with Sammy Rubicoff?

15:35.643 --> 15:37.144
Fine. Why?

15:37.227 --> 15:39.355
Well, we heard you had a run-in
with him at the Laugh Pit last week.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.106
I’m the first to have a run-in
with that asshole?

15:41.315 --> 15:43.025
You’re the first we heard
was making threats to him.

15:43.192 --> 15:46.236
Well, to fill you in, that’s pretty much
everybody that knows him.

15:46.528 --> 15:47.571
On account of what?

15:47.821 --> 15:51.742
The man is fat, disgusting,
unfunny, has no eye for talent.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.286
He missed the boat on you?
Is that what got you making threats?

15:54.536 --> 15:58.165
No, I got into it with horrid Sam
because he’s a cheap bastard.

15:58.248 --> 16:00.793
Yeah, we heard about him taking
away your nightly cold cuts.

16:01.001 --> 16:04.004
We also heard that guys were living off
that food and without it, they’d starve.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.715
-Are you one of those guys?
-I don’t need that bloated swine’s meat.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.677
I was in the fray out of solidarity
for the guys that do.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.096
Personally, I have to turn down work.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.098
Why do I find that hard to believe?

16:14.264 --> 16:17.017
Hey, you know, this has been fun,
but why am I here?

16:17.768 --> 16:20.020
Sammy was found murdered this morning.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.065
-What?
-Did you have anything to do with it?

16:23.190 --> 16:25.150
God, no. No.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.528
Well, you didn’t have a lot of nice
things to say for the guy.

16:27.820 --> 16:32.032
Come on, that’s just... (SIGHS)
He was like the tight-wad boss.

16:32.574 --> 16:35.285
It was like a moral imperative
to tee off on the guy,

16:35.369 --> 16:37.746
but that doesn’t mean I...
Sammy’s really dead?

16:38.122 --> 16:40.040
Where were you last night
till this morning?

16:40.958 --> 16:44.086
I... I was working Fritzy’s
Old Time Buffet in Poughkeepsie.

16:44.169 --> 16:47.047
-Where even the rats take penicillin.
-Hey, I get royalties on that.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.257
(LAUGHS)

16:49.383 --> 16:50.509
When did you get back?

16:51.176 --> 16:53.595
My train got back around two,
and I went home.

16:53.721 --> 16:57.182
-I wrote till like six, made some coffee.
-Can anyone back that up?

16:57.808 --> 17:00.769
My roommate, but he’s on a plane
right now to L.A.

17:00.894 --> 17:04.398
to pitch this awful sitcom
about Hasidic cops.

17:04.606 --> 17:07.651
There’s a talking chimp involved,
and I swear to God, if he sells it,

17:07.735 --> 17:09.403
I’m over the side
of the Williamsburg Bridge.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.656
All right, name and number,
where we can reach your roommate.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.002
Scott Grafton?

17:25.210 --> 17:27.421
You the guys from the 15th Squad
that gave me the 1085?

17:27.504 --> 17:29.965
Yeah, Sipowicz and Clark.
We gotta ask you a few questions.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.676
-No sweat.
-You know an Alex Palmer?

17:32.926 --> 17:35.804
-No, not by name, why?
-ANDY: He got shot this morning.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.474
We got an anonymous tip that
said to talk to you about it.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.642
I don’t know the guy.
I don’t know anything about the shooting.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.102
I hope you didn’t pay good money
for the info.

17:42.269 --> 17:44.313
Were you over near
Tompkins Square Park this morning?

17:44.897 --> 17:46.732
Sounds like further questioning
about this shooting,

17:46.815 --> 17:48.484
which I already told you
I know nothing about.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.360
I think you know how this goes
by now, Scott,

17:50.486 --> 17:51.653
so just answer the question.

17:51.862 --> 17:54.114
No, nowhere near that park.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.283
Where were you this morning
at eight o'clock?

17:57.159 --> 18:01.371
Anonymous tipster, or so you claim,
throws my name out and based on that,

18:01.455 --> 18:03.123
you run over here
and throw a shooting in my face?

18:05.167 --> 18:06.460
We’re waiting, Scott.

18:07.044 --> 18:10.130
Sipowicz, I heard about you.
I heard you was a stand-up guy.

18:10.839 --> 18:12.674
Why you trying to bullshit a fellow cop?

18:12.758 --> 18:14.843
Just tell us where you were this morning,
and we can be done with it.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.429
I was at the gym, 34th Street
from seven to nine.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.598
Then straight to my station house.

18:20.015 --> 18:21.183
All right then.

18:22.017 --> 18:24.144
-Sipowicz and?
-Clark.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.031
Your case?

18:36.115 --> 18:39.952
Oh, yeah, we got an odd hit
on DOA, Sam Rubicoff’s credit card

18:40.035 --> 18:42.538
late last night, boss.
We’re going to see the vendor.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.998
ME give us any word on the time of death?

18:45.165 --> 18:47.626
Yeah, gave us a time pretty much
around when the purchase was made.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.461
TONY: The DOA’s card stolen?

18:49.586 --> 18:52.381
We called to ask Rubicoff’s wife, Lois,
what Sammy carried with him,

18:52.464 --> 18:56.009
but a friend answered the phone
and said Lois was sedated and out cold.

18:56.093 --> 18:59.179
-Hmm. Hey, is that it?
-That’s it for now.

18:59.763 --> 19:02.432
-What, more boxes?
-Scott Grafton?

19:02.975 --> 19:04.226
A real hothead.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.311
He says he was at the gym
at the time of the murder.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.688
What’s the gym? I’ll give them a ring.

19:07.855 --> 19:10.440
If Grafton starts looking good for this,
I want IAB in fast.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.025
What kind of asshole has the nerve

19:12.109 --> 19:14.278
to send a truck full of boxes
before you’re even gone?

19:14.486 --> 19:17.114
-Did you hear what I said about IAB?
-Yeah, boss. We’re on it.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.410
Gentlemen and ladies
of the 15th, I have arrived.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.247
Permission to board, lieutenant.

19:25.455 --> 19:27.332
-Come in, Eddie.
-It’s busy, Gibson.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.126
-What are you doing here?
-Ha, ha, Andy.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.629
Sorry for the boxes coming in piecemeal.
My car broke down,

19:32.921 --> 19:35.048
so I’m bringing in loads
in the wife’s Festiva.

19:35.215 --> 19:36.967
-Those are your boxes?
-Of course they are.

19:37.092 --> 19:38.177
You’re the new CO?

19:38.427 --> 19:40.179
The chief of detectives
didn’t give you a heads-up?

19:40.762 --> 19:42.472
-No.
-Oh, jeez.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.308
I’ll come back after the tour.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.226
No, no, it’s all right. Come on in.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.062
EDDIE: Chief told me today was the day,
so I figured they’d tell you.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.815
But maybe it’s for the best,
because I got about a million questions,

19:51.899 --> 19:53.400
lieutenant, and I'm eager
to pick your brain.

19:53.650 --> 19:56.028
Let’s get started. Your office...

19:56.195 --> 19:58.363
Guys, just so you know,

19:58.447 --> 20:00.866
I’m well aware of the abilities
of the personnel in this squad,

20:00.991 --> 20:03.493
and I got no intention of fixing
what ain’t broke.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.330
And my management style, hands off.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.041
Unless one of you really steps
on your Johnson.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.377
Kidding. After you.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.300
-(DOOR CLOSES)
-This is April Fool's, right?

20:19.051 --> 20:20.177
It’s gonna be okay.

-(TELEPHONE RINGING)
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

20:37.236 --> 20:40.322
Gibson’s tailing him
like a trainee at a fast-food joint.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.991
The more he learns from Rodriguez,
the better off we’ll be.

20:43.158 --> 20:45.869
-He’ll learn nothing.
-Scott Grafton’s gym.

20:45.953 --> 20:48.205
(SIGHS) They got no record of him
being there this morning.

20:48.288 --> 20:49.623
JOHN: Which means no one saw him or...

20:49.748 --> 20:52.042
They swipe your membership card,
and it stays in the computer.

20:52.125 --> 20:55.420
No one saw Grafton, and they got
no record of him being swiped in.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.674
-Grafton’s alibi didn’t hold up.
-TONY: So IAB?

20:58.757 --> 21:00.259
He deserves a chance to explain.

21:00.509 --> 21:01.969
-One chance.
-Excellent.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.681
The reports from Anti-Crime
are in your office.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.892
-Oh! Apologies.
-No problem.

21:09.017 --> 21:10.102
I’m not even here.

21:15.023 --> 21:17.859
So, who did it?
Did you get the son of a bitch?

21:18.151 --> 21:19.611
What time did you get home
last night, Lois?

21:19.736 --> 21:21.780
I told you, two, 2:15.

21:21.905 --> 21:23.156
-Did you go straight home?
-Yeah.

21:23.490 --> 21:26.285
You stayed there
or you went out again?

21:26.743 --> 21:28.537
I stayed there. Why you badgering me?

21:28.787 --> 21:30.455
We got you making a credit-card purchase

21:30.539 --> 21:33.667
at Monteleone's All-Night Hardware
at 4:30 this morning.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.961
I’ve been a widow four hours,
and this is the treatment I get?

21:36.169 --> 21:37.421
Can you explain the charge?

21:37.671 --> 21:40.299
The card got stolen.
I forgot to report it.

21:40.465 --> 21:43.010
The clerk remembers you coming in.
He pulled your receipt.

21:44.052 --> 21:47.556
"Heavy-duty garbage bags,
duct tape, lime."

21:47.764 --> 21:48.807
See, the question now is,

21:48.890 --> 21:51.560
when did you buy what we call
the murder kit?

21:52.185 --> 21:55.063
If it was before your husband was dead,
it’s premeditated.

21:55.439 --> 21:58.608
If it was after, then you could argue
that it was a crime of passion.

22:00.235 --> 22:01.236
After.

22:02.779 --> 22:04.156
But I did not kill Sammy.

22:05.198 --> 22:06.199
Lonnie Cutler did it.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.870
-Lonnie Cut... Come on, Lois.
-Lonnie is a no-talent loser.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.998
Sammy wouldn’t let him perform
in the club anymore, and Lonnie flipped.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.541
And you saw this happen?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.127
I was in the office,
and I heard them arguing.

22:17.502 --> 22:19.421
I went down to find out what
Lonnie’s problem was,

22:19.671 --> 22:23.216
and I see him standing over my husband,
who was on the floor in a pool of blood.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.844
And then you ran out to the hardware store
to cover it up?

22:25.927 --> 22:30.891
I was taken to the hardware store,
kidnapped, and forced to buy those things.

22:31.266 --> 22:33.935
Clerk doesn’t remember Lonnie
in the hardware store, only you.

22:34.561 --> 22:35.771
Lonnie waited in the car.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.647
Why didn’t you tell the clerk
to call the police?

22:37.731 --> 22:40.275
Lonnie threatened to kill me
if I said anything.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.987
You want proof?
In the office, there’s a loose floorboard

22:44.071 --> 22:47.199
where I stashed Lonnie’s bloody shirt.
He told me to burn it,

22:47.657 --> 22:50.619
while he figured out what to do
with Sammy’s body, but I didn't.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.039
Because my husband deserved
more than that.

22:54.706 --> 22:55.874
Let’s go get the shirt.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.004
Why don’t you have a seat, Scott?

23:04.007 --> 23:05.217
So, we got a little problem here.

23:05.675 --> 23:06.718
Janet told me.

23:07.803 --> 23:10.263
Told you... told you what, specifically?

23:10.472 --> 23:12.015
Said she was having an affair

23:12.432 --> 23:14.476
with a guy that turned up
DOA this morning.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.019
Was she your anonymous tipster?

23:16.311 --> 23:17.938
JOHN: We got it through the DOA’s
phone records.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.773
Coming to you was the next logical step.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.067
She told me she met this guy
at a coffee shop.

23:22.859 --> 23:24.069
Is that what she told you guys?

23:24.194 --> 23:26.029
Scott, we're trying to clear you
for a murder.

23:26.154 --> 23:28.407
-Start focusing on that.
-Hey, I didn’t kill the guy.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.742
Then why did you lie
about where you were this morning?

23:31.410 --> 23:34.371
Computer at the gym
didn’t show your card being swiped.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.915
So Scott, where were you this morning?

23:37.958 --> 23:40.919
I was tailing Janet, trying to see
if she was cheating on me.

23:41.169 --> 23:43.505
Hoping she wasn’t. I knew it, though.

23:44.047 --> 23:45.799
I knew she was out there
with somebody else.

23:46.049 --> 23:47.968
-You’re gonna need to prove that.
-Fine.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.387
Did you maybe talk
to your partner about all this,

23:50.470 --> 23:54.266
or an informant, somebody in your life
who’d want you to feel better?

23:54.516 --> 23:56.935
No, the only person I’ve been talking
to about this is Janet,

23:57.269 --> 24:00.981
and she’s been denying it, denying it,
denying it right to my face.

24:01.314 --> 24:02.649
ANDY: This was looking like a hit.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.151
I don’t give a damn what it looks like.

24:04.234 --> 24:06.445
and as far as that guy goes,
good riddance.

24:08.447 --> 24:11.450
When you left your house,
the route you took,

24:11.700 --> 24:14.119
places you stopped, people who saw you.

24:20.208 --> 24:21.334
(SIGHS)

24:26.423 --> 24:29.217
-This guy is a risk.
-Yeah, maybe.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.970
I mean forget that he’s our main suspect,
because who knows how long it will take

24:32.179 --> 24:33.263
for the case to clear.

24:33.346 --> 24:36.141
I’m talking about right now, he is a risk

24:36.433 --> 24:38.351
to his wife, to himself.

24:38.435 --> 24:40.020
You thinking about calling
early intervention?

24:40.479 --> 24:42.230
(SIGHS) Yeah.

24:43.648 --> 24:44.649
Well, what do you think?

24:45.275 --> 24:48.111
Well, if going a little nuts
over some broad was a disqualifier,

24:48.195 --> 24:50.906
then half the guys on the job
are in the rubber-gun squad.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.951
So, what are you saying,
we sit on our hands?

24:55.202 --> 24:57.245
No. I’m saying it ain’t something
to take lightly.

24:57.954 --> 25:00.165
It’s easy to take a guy’s gun,
it’s a lot harder to get it back.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.918
What about calling early intervention
and tell them what we know?

25:03.001 --> 25:04.836
Let them make the decision,
that’s what they do for a living.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.671
Yeah. But the reality is,

25:06.880 --> 25:09.049
you call intervention,
they’re gonna take his guns away.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.429
You know, toward the end when my dad
was having problems,

25:14.513 --> 25:17.390
the booze, the mood swings,
I knew he had guns.

25:18.683 --> 25:21.978
And I thought about making the call,
but I didn’t want to insult him, or...

25:23.021 --> 25:24.731
(SIGHS) ...make him feel worse
than he was.

25:24.856 --> 25:27.734
And I wanted to believe
that he wasn’t doing as bad as I thought.

25:29.778 --> 25:31.530
But maybe if he couldn’t reach
into that drawer

25:31.613 --> 25:33.740
after getting his load on,
things would have turned out differently.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.493
You can’t do this to yourself.

25:37.827 --> 25:41.122
Because I’d give anything
to... have him still around

25:41.248 --> 25:44.417
and be pissed off at me then...
you know...

25:45.752 --> 25:48.380
John, your dad was heading down that road,

25:48.713 --> 25:50.590
and there was nothing
you could do about it.

25:52.425 --> 25:54.844
I’d feel better today if I knew
I did everything I could.

25:55.470 --> 25:56.471
Call intervention then.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.975
I’m not trying to confuse the two.

26:00.058 --> 26:02.185
I’m just saying that this guy is showing
that he’s a risk, Andy.

26:02.269 --> 26:03.436
Then pick up the phone.

26:05.438 --> 26:06.439
All right.

26:06.773 --> 26:08.608
You can’t be doing that to yourself.

26:09.985 --> 26:11.111
Yeah.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.619
(HAMMER BANGING)

26:22.622 --> 26:25.125
Okay, last chance to get
in front of this if it’s a joke.

26:25.333 --> 26:27.335
You carry it out any longer,
I’m gonna get pissed.

26:27.419 --> 26:30.797
-It’s no joke. He’s your new CO.
-He’s not even a lieutenant.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.008
There aren’t enough lieutenants
who have been in the bureau long enough,

26:33.091 --> 26:34.926
-so they’re taking sergeants.
-(LOUD BANG)

26:37.929 --> 26:39.556
CONNIE: I have a friend
who works in headquarters.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.975
She says, back in the day,
Eddie worked in a radio car

26:42.058 --> 26:44.227
with the chief of personnel.
They live in the same neighborhood.

26:44.311 --> 26:46.521
They’re golf buddies.
That’s who got him in.

26:46.771 --> 26:48.023
(SCOFFS)

26:48.481 --> 26:51.234
-TONY: What’s up with Scott Grafton?
-Still claiming no involvement.

26:51.318 --> 26:53.445
He gave us another story as
to where he was this morning.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.155
-I’ll check it out.
-What’s his new story?

26:55.405 --> 26:59.242
Basically was following his wife around
trying to catch her in the act.

26:59.367 --> 27:01.453
-(BANGING CONTINUES)
-Excuse me one moment. (GROANS)

27:02.454 --> 27:05.832
My name is Marilyn Graber,
and I need to see a detective immediately.

27:06.124 --> 27:07.125
What’s the problem?

27:07.208 --> 27:09.210
I’m making eggs this morning
when my son, Evan,

27:09.294 --> 27:13.465
who was supposed to be on his way
to school, comes back with this.

27:18.678 --> 27:22.474
-He found it in a park this morning,
-I was gonna bring it to the cops.

27:22.557 --> 27:25.226
-Yeah, after you show your friends.
-Which park, Evan?

27:26.186 --> 27:28.396
-MARILYN: Answer him.
-Tompkins Square Park.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.774
It’s a .38. Same caliber as this morning.

27:30.982 --> 27:32.359
Let’s go talk in here, ma’am.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.820
Ever since his father left...

27:40.283 --> 27:41.326
(GLASS SHATTERING)

27:41.409 --> 27:42.535
-(SIGHS)
-EDDIE: Nuts!

27:43.495 --> 27:44.746
Why don’t you have a seat?

27:46.956 --> 27:48.667
JOHN: Why don’t you walk us
through it, Evan?

27:48.750 --> 27:51.044
I swear I was gonna go to the police.

27:51.127 --> 27:54.005
We believe you. Don’t worry about it.
Just tell us how you found it.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.841
So, I was walking to school
through the park,

27:57.258 --> 28:01.304
when I look over, and there’s this guy
with his hands in his pockets

28:01.388 --> 28:02.430
like he’s waiting for someone.

28:03.223 --> 28:06.226
And I walk past him a little bit,
then when I look back,

28:06.309 --> 28:09.688
I saw him throw something into the shrubs
and walk away.

28:09.854 --> 28:11.856
And I noticed it was shiny,
whatever he threw,

28:11.940 --> 28:13.775
so I went over, and I checked it out.

28:14.651 --> 28:16.778
And then I took it home.

28:17.070 --> 28:18.238
How did you find it, ma’am?

28:18.321 --> 28:21.282
Well, he came home
because he said he forgot a book,

28:21.658 --> 28:24.911
but he was looking very suspicious,
and I know when he’s up to something.

28:24.994 --> 28:27.789
So, when he was in the bathroom,
I went through his backpack.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.291
She’s always going through my stuff.

28:30.417 --> 28:32.669
Like a good parent should.
Thank you very much.

28:32.919 --> 28:34.129
(BANGING CONTINUES)

28:34.254 --> 28:37.340
Evan, did you see this guy
who dumped the gun?

28:37.799 --> 28:39.426
-Yeah.
-What did he look like?

28:39.843 --> 28:42.512
White guy, just kind of normal looking.

28:42.637 --> 28:44.472
Could you identify him
if you saw him again?

28:44.973 --> 28:48.268
-I don’t know, maybe.
-Yes or no, young man.

28:49.269 --> 28:51.521
Yes, probably. Okay?

28:52.021 --> 28:53.189
All right, you stay here.

28:53.314 --> 28:55.066
We’re gonna get you set up
with some photo arrays.

28:55.191 --> 28:57.026
He’s not in trouble, is he?

28:57.110 --> 28:59.112
No. If he helps us find
who dumped that gun,

28:59.362 --> 29:01.990
we’re putting his picture up in the squad,
"Teenager of the year."

29:03.116 --> 29:04.367
Did you hear that?

29:05.452 --> 29:07.746
-Whatever.
-(BANGING CONTINUES)

29:09.789 --> 29:12.333
-Is that your shirt?
-Unbelievable!

29:12.584 --> 29:14.586
I can’t tell you, Lonnie,
how sad it makes me

29:14.669 --> 29:17.464
-to be sitting here with you like this.
-She gave you the shirt? Lois?

29:17.839 --> 29:20.675
What was the turning point?
I mean, you’re a funny guy.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.303
-I didn’t kill that fat prick, she did.
-Lois did?

29:23.553 --> 29:25.805
She bashed him over the head
with a microphone stand.

29:26.055 --> 29:27.599
-Wearing your shirt?
-(SCOFFS)

29:27.682 --> 29:30.143
She called me afterwards,
asked me to come down,

29:30.226 --> 29:31.352
help her get rid of the body.

29:31.561 --> 29:33.855
It made a mess on my shirt,
so I told her to burn it.

29:34.063 --> 29:36.065
God, I should have knew
she’d try to screw me.

29:36.274 --> 29:37.901
So you put Sammy in the trunk of his car?

29:38.151 --> 29:40.737
Heaved Sammy in the trunk,
nearly throwing out my back.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.448
I drove it under the bridge.
I left the car

29:43.531 --> 29:44.783
'cause I didn’t want nothing
more to do with it.

29:45.116 --> 29:48.286
But you still haven’t said why Lois
called you to dispose of her husband.

29:50.079 --> 29:52.332
I was banging the battle-ax
for stage time.

29:53.208 --> 29:57.128
She called me in a panic.
I went over there, you know the rest.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.589
Still, we got a he said, she said here,
Lonnie.

29:59.756 --> 30:02.634
Lois said that Sammy found out
she was whoring around.

30:02.926 --> 30:05.220
Said he was going to divorce her
and make sure she didn’t get a dime,

30:05.303 --> 30:09.182
so she whacked him one. (SIGHS)
You know, I was afraid of this.

30:10.350 --> 30:14.145
This is off my answering machine,
she called me at home.

30:15.271 --> 30:18.983
LOIS: <i>Sweetheart, honey,</i>
<i>it’s Lois. I think I hurt Sam.</i>

30:19.150 --> 30:22.028
<i>You’ve gotta help me, baby.</i>
<i>Call me right away.</i>

30:22.111 --> 30:23.404
(ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS)

30:36.459 --> 30:37.460
Anything?

30:37.544 --> 30:39.671
He couldn’t pick Scott Grafton
out of a photo array.

30:40.004 --> 30:42.340
-So now what?
-In the event Scott contracted the hit,

30:42.423 --> 30:44.592
we’re gonna show the kid an array
with Scott’s partner in it.

30:44.759 --> 30:47.011
We’re also gonna show him
the DOA’s business partner.

30:47.136 --> 30:48.721
-TONY: He might be involved in this?
-(ANDY SIGHS)

30:48.930 --> 30:49.931
We’re gonna show him every white male

30:50.014 --> 30:51.683
that was somehow related
to the DOA’s life.

30:51.891 --> 30:53.017
Okay.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.061
(SIGHS) How you doing?

30:56.563 --> 30:58.523
-It’s starting to sink in.
-Yeah.

31:01.192 --> 31:03.027
More pictures? What's he gonna hang ’em
from the ceiling?

31:03.528 --> 31:05.905
That uniform whose wife
was banging your DOA,

31:06.030 --> 31:07.657
-Scott Grafton.
-What about him?

31:07.907 --> 31:09.242
He’s downstairs putting up a fuss.

31:09.784 --> 31:11.911
They’re not gonna let him up, are they?
I mean, our witness is right there.

31:12.161 --> 31:14.205
-No. Desk sergeant told him to stay put.
-Good.

31:14.539 --> 31:17.417
But he’s going on about how one of you
called an early intervention on him.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.878
But don’t worry,
I told him there’s no way either of you

31:19.961 --> 31:21.963
would do that to a fellow cop, right?

31:32.432 --> 31:33.766
-Who did it?
-In there.

31:33.933 --> 31:36.394
Why don’t you be man enough to admit it
if you called intervention on me.

31:36.477 --> 31:39.188
I’ll be man enough to hit you
in your mouth if you keep running it.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.523
Let’s talk in there.

31:45.945 --> 31:46.988
Don’t try denying it.

31:47.322 --> 31:50.199
I called Janet. She swore it wasn’t her,
so that leaves you two.

31:50.366 --> 31:51.409
I called.

31:52.076 --> 31:53.369
How you want to settle this, huh?

31:53.578 --> 31:55.872
What is this, <i>High Noon?</i>
You got bigger problems, Scott.

31:55.955 --> 31:58.374
No, he’s got a beef with me.
We’re gonna settle it.

31:58.458 --> 31:59.667
I got no beef with you, Scott,

31:59.834 --> 32:01.669
beyond the fact that
you’re not thinking straight.

32:01.836 --> 32:03.171
I’m on modified assignment.

32:03.379 --> 32:05.590
I’ve got a nine a.m. at psych services.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.467
They took my guns!

the way you’ve been doing,

32:09.510 --> 32:10.637
you don’t see where this is headed?

32:10.720 --> 32:12.889
Hey, I’m doing what I can
to save my marriage.

32:13.306 --> 32:15.308
-You trying to bang her, too?
-Scott, wake up.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.477
We’ve got a witness
in this morning’s shooting.

32:17.810 --> 32:20.104
I got nothing to do with that.
I keep on telling you guys.

32:20.313 --> 32:23.191
-They’re looking at photos right now.
-You think I’d be that sloppy?

32:23.691 --> 32:25.777
Say I knew who this guy was
and I got out of my head,

32:26.152 --> 32:28.029
you think I’d take him out
in broad daylight?

32:28.529 --> 32:29.614
And you’re wondering why I made the call.

32:29.822 --> 32:31.824
You guys just keep on
twisting everything around!

32:31.950 --> 32:33.326
It’s your last chance
to get in front of this.

32:33.451 --> 32:34.452
I didn’t do nothing!

unless we call you in,

32:37.080 --> 32:39.374

in the photos we’ve been showing you

32:53.054 --> 32:54.555
look like the type of guy
who dumped the gun?

32:55.056 --> 32:56.057
Kinda.

32:56.557 --> 32:58.309
How good of a look did you actually get?

32:58.601 --> 32:59.644
Pretty good one.

32:59.894 --> 33:02.647
Run it for us again, Evan,
and don’t leave anything out.

33:02.730 --> 33:04.524
No matter how trivial
you think it might be.

33:04.732 --> 33:07.610
Okay, I was sitting there,
waiting to go to school.

33:07.860 --> 33:08.903
Sitting where?

33:09.112 --> 33:10.571
-On a bench.
-Okay.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.073
And I saw the man,

33:12.156 --> 33:14.993
he had a black coat
with his hands in his pockets.

33:15.618 --> 33:18.496
-Where was he in relation to you?
-Right in front of me.

-His hair was kind of curly.
-Was it? (CLOSES DOOR)

33:38.349 --> 33:39.600
Yeah. I remember that.

33:39.976 --> 33:43.021
Evan... (CLEARS THROAT)
...when we talked to you earlier,

33:43.438 --> 33:45.606
you said you were walking
when you saw that man.

33:45.690 --> 33:46.691
I was.

33:46.983 --> 33:48.609
Then why did you just say
you were sitting on a bench?

33:50.153 --> 33:53.031
Well, I was sitting on the bench,
and then I started walking.

33:53.489 --> 33:56.701
ANDY: Okay, so when you started walking,
where was the guy when he dumped the gun?

33:56.909 --> 33:58.870
In front of me, like 20 yards.

33:58.995 --> 34:03.332
Now, you said earlier that you turned back
and looked at him when he dumped it.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.545
Well, it was kind of like,
you know, a half turn.

34:08.921 --> 34:10.339
I can’t remember really.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.425
You’re telling two different stories,
Evan.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.010
And this just happened this morning,

34:14.135 --> 34:16.012
so I know damn well,
you remember everything.

34:16.179 --> 34:18.973
-I didn’t kill that guy.
-Ever hear of paraffin?

34:19.974 --> 34:23.019
It’s the stuff that we put on your hands,
and it reacts to gun powder.

34:23.519 --> 34:25.521
So, if you fired a gun, it’ll show.

34:25.980 --> 34:27.565
You know what the next stop is after that?

34:28.691 --> 34:32.445
Juvenile detention center,
prison essentially.

34:32.820 --> 34:33.863
I didn’t do it.

34:33.946 --> 34:35.990
JOHN: Now, listen to me,
we’ve been down to that juvenile center,

34:36.157 --> 34:38.743
and a kid like you does not want
to be there.

34:38.993 --> 34:40.036
Tell us what happened.

34:40.119 --> 34:42.914
If it was an accident,
we can try and avoid all that.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.541
Was it an accident?

-What happened?
-My mom is gonna kill me.

34:51.255 --> 34:52.256
ANDY: What happened, Evan?

34:54.842 --> 34:57.428
A couple of weeks ago,
I was walking to school,

34:57.512 --> 35:00.890
and these guys,
these older guys stopped me.

35:01.641 --> 35:04.811
They took my money,
they took my backpack.

35:06.020 --> 35:09.357
They made me take my underwear off
and they put it in my mouth.

35:11.025 --> 35:12.652
They wrote things on me.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.363
Were you at the park this morning
hoping to see them again?

35:18.741 --> 35:22.078
-Where did you get the gun?
-I bought it from a kid at school.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.788
How did you end up shooting the jogger?

35:23.996 --> 35:25.706
Every day for the last week,

35:25.790 --> 35:28.334
I’ve been sitting on that bench
with the gun.

35:29.001 --> 35:31.921
And I just wanted to scare
those guys who robbed me.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.173
I don’t know. I...

35:34.549 --> 35:36.759
I guess I got tired of sitting there,

35:36.884 --> 35:41.139
and... I wanted to feel
what it was like to shoot the gun,

35:41.222 --> 35:42.974
so I fired it at a tree.

35:44.934 --> 35:48.187
I missed the tree,
and I saw that guy fall down,

35:48.729 --> 35:51.315
and I knew something bad
had happened, so I ran.

Your son admitted it was him who shot
that jogger in the park this morning.

36:43.326 --> 36:45.411
He was just going to look at mug books.

36:45.536 --> 36:47.121
We asked him some questions,

36:47.205 --> 36:49.790
and... he admitted he shot towards a tree
and hit the man.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.460
You’re gonna need to speak
to an attorney about this.

36:53.586 --> 36:56.005
-Is he under arrest?
-Yeah, he is.

36:56.714 --> 37:01.010
Well... just wait a minute.
I’d like to talk to my son.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.638
He needs some time to finish
his statement,

-Sure.

No ma'am, but you better start
dealing with this right now.

make it up as he goes along.
