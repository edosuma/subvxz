WEBVTT

00:35.600 --> 00:38.951
Well, well, well.
Here we have it, gang.

00:41.432 --> 00:42.955
Here we have it.

00:42.999 --> 00:45.610
The theories are
no longer theoretical.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.397
Welcome to
the waters of Pandora.

00:49.440 --> 00:53.227
Woo-wee!

00:53.270 --> 00:55.664
It'’s time to take some samples.

00:55.707 --> 00:57.709
-I'’ll do some more exploring.
-Thank you.

00:57.753 --> 01:00.277
-Let'’s do it.
-I am so excited

01:00.321 --> 01:01.887
Who would have thought, huh?

01:01.931 --> 01:04.064
-Let'’s go.
-Yes, sound'’s good.

01:04.107 --> 01:05.891
Let'’s do it.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.113
-This thing'’s cold.
-I know.

01:10.157 --> 01:13.464
-Yes.
-Clarity is good.

01:13.508 --> 01:16.424
Moderate levels of visible
organic material.

01:19.731 --> 01:21.342
Hmm.

01:28.653 --> 01:31.439
Guys, this is odd.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.138
What'’s odd, Kyle?

01:35.182 --> 01:36.661
Hey.

01:36.705 --> 01:38.489
I don'’t
understand all this--

01:38.533 --> 01:39.708
[radio static]

01:39.751 --> 01:40.665
Kyle.

01:41.971 --> 01:44.582
Sophie.
Where'’s Kyle?

01:49.109 --> 01:50.719
He was standing right
next to me a second ago.

01:52.242 --> 01:53.330
Kyle?
Sophie, get out of the water.

01:55.724 --> 01:57.117
Sophie, get out of
the water now.

01:58.379 --> 02:00.642
Sophie!
Sophie!

02:17.746 --> 02:18.660
Sophie!

02:26.972 --> 02:29.192
Mayday! Mayday!

02:29.236 --> 02:32.195
This is Captain Black
aboard the Cassini 3.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.284
My team needs help!

02:34.328 --> 02:35.633
My team'’s been--

02:35.677 --> 02:38.375
[rumbling]

02:38.419 --> 02:40.334
Mayday!

02:42.249 --> 02:43.467
[screams]

02:52.781 --> 02:54.043
[group chattering]

02:58.439 --> 03:01.006
Oh, uh, good.

03:01.050 --> 03:02.617
Drs. Jennifer, Cliff Ryan.

03:02.660 --> 03:05.097
Thanks for joining
us on such short notice.

03:05.141 --> 03:08.753
This is Colonel William Bradley.

03:08.797 --> 03:11.103
-Thank you, Miss Harris.
-Colonel.

03:11.147 --> 03:13.410
Less than five hours ago
we received communication

03:13.454 --> 03:15.282
from the Cassini 3 explorer.

03:15.325 --> 03:17.371
It was a mayday
distress call.

03:17.414 --> 03:19.634
and then we lost
all contact with them.

03:19.677 --> 03:21.288
We need to send
a rescue team immediately

03:21.331 --> 03:22.332
and find out what'’s going on.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.378
Colonel Bradley will oversee

03:24.421 --> 03:27.250
the rescue unit from
here at Space Force command.

03:27.294 --> 03:30.514
Mr. And Mrs. Ryan, you will
do the same and advise us on

03:30.558 --> 03:32.777
any emergency
medical treatment needed.

03:32.821 --> 03:37.217
Our team will be escorted
by Commander Hank Lewis

03:37.260 --> 03:40.045
who will be piloting
his Luna-One spacecraft

03:40.089 --> 03:42.918
which will tow our
new medical rescue craft.

03:42.961 --> 03:46.574
Hank Lewis? I'’ve read
about him at the Academy.

03:46.617 --> 03:49.141
Didn'’t he make his name shooting
down Chinese spy satellites?

03:49.185 --> 03:51.883
Commander Lewis has been
granted liberty

03:51.927 --> 03:54.495
that most of our pilots have
not per Special Forces.

03:54.538 --> 03:56.148
When you meet with him

03:56.192 --> 03:58.150
I suggest you take
everything with a grain of salt.

03:58.194 --> 04:01.676
As he is uniquely skilled and
our most seasoned pilot.

04:01.719 --> 04:03.373
And his ship
is one of the few left

04:03.417 --> 04:06.071
that can actually dock,
transport a second craft and

04:06.115 --> 04:08.552
withstand the ordeal
of the journey.

04:08.596 --> 04:10.250
Journey to where?

04:12.295 --> 04:14.689
Pandora.

04:14.732 --> 04:17.996
-The moon circling Saturn?
-Correct.

04:18.040 --> 04:21.435
We just sent a team to
investigate and collect samples.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.959
Like we said,
Commander Lewis will be

04:24.002 --> 04:28.180
our rescue escort and deploy
the medical craft doctors.

04:28.224 --> 04:30.966
-But that trip will take months.
-No, not anymore.

04:31.009 --> 04:33.229
Last year, Space Force
opened the wormhole

04:33.273 --> 04:36.101
and that trip is
practically instantaneous now.

04:36.145 --> 04:38.060
Major Lewis wasn'’t pleased.

04:38.103 --> 04:40.845
He had patented a sodium
ion engine that he planned

04:40.889 --> 04:43.457
to run trials on
to the outer solar system.

04:43.500 --> 04:47.548
That engine is now
obsolete given the wormhole.

04:47.591 --> 04:50.202
Now, although our
experiment was not perfected

04:50.246 --> 04:52.770
the event horizon
is only cyclical.

04:52.814 --> 04:54.990
Meaning it'’s only
accessible periodically.

04:55.033 --> 04:58.167
So it'’s open part of the time.

05:00.082 --> 05:03.825
10 hours open,
six months closed.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.350
Excuse me.

05:07.394 --> 05:08.873
Who did you send out there?

05:08.917 --> 05:12.660
Dr. Gregory Black
is leading the team.

05:12.703 --> 05:14.966
-Greg?
-That'’s right.

05:15.010 --> 05:18.492
Yes. I believe you and
Dr. Black have a history.

05:18.535 --> 05:20.798
I hope that won'’t be a problem.

05:21.886 --> 05:22.974
No.

05:23.018 --> 05:24.672
No, we, um...

05:24.715 --> 05:27.370
We went through Space Forces
medical division together.

05:27.414 --> 05:31.069
Pilot and rescue.
We were friends.

05:31.113 --> 05:33.245
Friends that had some pretty
serious disagreements.

05:33.289 --> 05:35.378
That rift nearly
ended your careers.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.075
Is that the guy?

05:37.119 --> 05:38.947
Your live-in
business partner?

05:38.990 --> 05:41.689
Before us? Yes.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.954
How do you know
about me and Greg?

05:45.997 --> 05:47.956
I read your dossier.

05:47.999 --> 05:51.525
You are head of our
Disease Control division.

05:51.568 --> 05:55.529
You'’re more of
an absolutist, Jennifer.

05:55.572 --> 05:59.184
Greg, on the other hand
was more willing to

05:59.228 --> 06:01.665
let one life go to save many.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.014
You'’re the best in the world.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.017
That, plus your intimate
knowledge

06:06.061 --> 06:08.585
of Greg'’s work makes you
essential for this mission.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.502
You think
that Greg and his team

06:12.546 --> 06:14.939
may be sick or infected?

06:16.027 --> 06:17.681
We don'’t know.

06:17.725 --> 06:20.292
Like I said, we lost contact
with him about five hours ago

06:20.336 --> 06:22.904
which is why
we called you in immediately.

06:22.947 --> 06:25.167
Space force wanted
to make sure we covered

06:25.210 --> 06:27.125
all of our bases ASAP.

06:27.169 --> 06:30.172
Now, so you know
Greg'’s primary mission was

06:30.215 --> 06:31.869
to investigate a water supply.

06:31.913 --> 06:34.350
Uh, wha--

06:34.394 --> 06:37.222
Sorry, excuse me, Admiral, but

06:37.266 --> 06:41.009
I understand that
I'’m to advise here on earth,

06:41.052 --> 06:45.448
but with Greg and his team
investigating a water source

06:45.492 --> 06:47.232
that could mean
fast-acting toxins,

06:47.276 --> 06:51.280
deadly bacterium, all unknown.

06:51.323 --> 06:53.456
If they'’re endangered,
then assessments need

06:53.500 --> 06:55.850
to happen real time.

06:55.893 --> 06:57.591
Are you suggesting
that we travel

06:57.634 --> 06:59.854
to a moon outside of Saturn?

06:59.897 --> 07:02.378
I'’m saying I should go.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.033
If you go,
then I have to go, too.

07:05.076 --> 07:07.296
I don'’t think going
there is a good idea.

07:07.339 --> 07:09.951
All right, denied, doctors.

07:09.994 --> 07:12.388
We'’d rather
have special ops in the field

07:12.432 --> 07:14.564
to deal with any potentially
life threatening situations,

07:14.608 --> 07:17.001
not science officers.

07:17.045 --> 07:19.221
But I know Greg.

07:19.264 --> 07:22.790
I mean, like you said, I know
his research, how he thinks.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.835
She has a good point.

07:24.879 --> 07:27.490
These doctor'’s skills might
be better utilized in the field.

07:27.534 --> 07:31.146
Cliff, you'’re an expert
on Saturn'’s moons, correct?

07:31.189 --> 07:33.453
Neptune, but yes.

07:33.496 --> 07:35.411
Dr. Black'’s research
and mine overlap.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.934
It'’s pretty impossible
to make

07:36.978 --> 07:39.023
life and death medical
assessments

07:39.067 --> 07:42.244
over an hour lag time for
millions of miles away. Correct?

07:45.813 --> 07:48.163
My team could
be ready in three hours.

07:56.127 --> 07:59.914
All right.
I guess we'’re going.

07:59.957 --> 08:02.394
I guess that does
fit in with our timeline,

08:02.438 --> 08:03.831
doesn'’t it, Colonel?

08:03.874 --> 08:08.009
Let me remind everyone here.

08:08.052 --> 08:11.534
We have a lot invested in this,

08:11.578 --> 08:14.363
including human lives.

08:14.406 --> 08:15.582
Suit up at the flight deck.

08:15.625 --> 08:18.280
Commander Lewis
is prepping for launch.

08:18.323 --> 08:21.370
And let'’s make sure that ship
is stocked with ammunition,

08:21.413 --> 08:22.632
just in case.

08:22.676 --> 08:24.242
Sorry, in case of what?

08:24.286 --> 08:27.289
In case of an engagement
with any sort of enemy.

08:27.332 --> 08:29.117
Better to be
safe than sorry, doctor.

08:31.728 --> 08:33.338
Right this way.

08:45.133 --> 08:47.483
Arcturus medical ship
is docked below.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.790
Luna-One taking off.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.443
Good evening, Captain Lewis.

08:51.487 --> 08:54.490
We are en route to
the Pandora wormhole.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.537
The crew is readying the ship
for the wormhole entrance.

08:59.669 --> 09:02.193
All engineering and
strategic considerations

09:02.237 --> 09:04.369
will be shared
between yours and my purview.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.764
Commander Lewis,
we'’re almost ready.

09:07.808 --> 09:10.811
Bradley, it'’s been a while.
They paying you extra?

09:13.074 --> 09:15.119
Day'’s work.

09:15.163 --> 09:18.253
Yeah. No one can outmaneuver us
or outstrategize us.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.081
Wormhole or not,
right, Frank?

09:20.124 --> 09:22.605
All engineering and
strategic considerations

09:22.649 --> 09:24.781
will be shared
between yours and my purview.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.963
Heard what the A.I. said?
Standard protocol.

09:33.007 --> 09:35.923
Any alien life,
including microscopic,

09:35.966 --> 09:40.014
is quarantined off
of my ship for evaluation.

09:40.057 --> 09:42.625
-Copy?
-We copy you, Commander.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.540
We are now approaching
the nebulas.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.847
Prepare for a bumpy ride.

09:46.890 --> 09:47.848
Strap in.

10:09.086 --> 10:11.132
Commander, we must
ignite the engines

10:11.175 --> 10:13.830
to surpass these nebulas.
-Ignition.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.012
Attention. We are closing.
in on the wormhole.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.579
and then
we will reach Pandora.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.103
That'’s where
the real fun begins.

10:26.147 --> 10:27.539
Fun starts sooner than that.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.890
You ever travel through
a wormhole?

10:29.933 --> 10:33.633
We'’re the fastest rollercoaster
in the world times 100

10:33.676 --> 10:35.243
But in reverse.

10:35.286 --> 10:38.202
Like kids in
a candy store on Halloween.

10:38.246 --> 10:40.074
Sir, with
the latest high octane

10:40.117 --> 10:42.380
assault rifle on the market.

10:42.424 --> 10:46.602
Colonel, your team is
aware this is a rescue mission.

10:46.646 --> 10:51.476
They'’re military trained.
Prepare for any case situation.

10:51.520 --> 10:54.654
-What does that exactly mean?
-It means they follow orders.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.394
My orders.

10:56.438 --> 11:00.094
Administrator Harris put me
in charge of medically treating

11:00.137 --> 11:02.749
Dr. Black'’s team and giving
him a thorough examination.

11:02.792 --> 11:04.533
That'’s right.
After we find them.

11:04.576 --> 11:06.796
Provided they'’re
all still alive.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.146
Until then, I give the orders.

11:09.190 --> 11:12.410
Look, the safety of you,
your husband and my unit,

11:12.454 --> 11:15.979
that'’s my responsibility,
understood?

11:18.590 --> 11:22.551
Entering wormhole.
Repeat. Entering wormhole.

11:31.908 --> 11:35.129
Sounds like this roller coaster
is about to jump the track.

11:36.217 --> 11:38.001
Ah, you only live once!

11:38.045 --> 11:39.742
That'’s open for debate.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.703
Only trained
for moon exploration.

11:43.746 --> 11:46.357
I never simulated
wormhole travel.

11:46.401 --> 11:49.230
Just think of me.
Think happy thoughts.

11:49.273 --> 11:50.361
That I can do.

11:50.405 --> 11:54.017
You two. Take these.

11:54.061 --> 11:56.106
Put them in. Bite down so
you don'’t bite your tongues

11:56.150 --> 11:57.891
off during the turbulence.

12:01.851 --> 12:03.070
[grunting]

12:04.680 --> 12:06.290
Entering the wormhole now.

12:12.688 --> 12:14.211
[alarm blaring]

12:14.255 --> 12:16.387
Commander,
that electricity fried

12:16.431 --> 12:17.780
the leveling sensor
on the stern.

12:17.824 --> 12:20.696
Tactical positioning
compromised.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.785
There'’s a fuel
compression alarm.

12:22.829 --> 12:25.745
Leave the opinions to me
and the AI, professor.

12:25.788 --> 12:27.398
The stress
on the hull is bending

12:27.442 --> 12:28.791
the port side interior lines

12:28.835 --> 12:30.924
of your new
to sodium ion thruster.

12:30.967 --> 12:33.709
We need to relieve
the stress from the inside.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.363
The alarm is coming
from the compression of

12:35.406 --> 12:36.407
the untested thruster.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.018
How did it burst?

12:38.061 --> 12:41.369
We either stressed to the
hull 86,000 PSI.

12:41.412 --> 12:42.631
Strap back in!

12:42.674 --> 12:45.112
Port side lead.

12:45.155 --> 12:46.069
That'’s not going to work.

12:47.679 --> 12:48.724
No!

12:50.900 --> 12:54.295
You need to secure
the line on the inside.

12:54.338 --> 12:55.513
[shouts]

13:00.083 --> 13:01.041
We can use the near-surface
repelling line

13:01.084 --> 13:02.129
to support the pipe.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.654
-Come on.
-Come on.

13:05.697 --> 13:06.655
[grunting]

13:13.009 --> 13:16.186
We'’re securing
the line from the inside.

13:18.667 --> 13:21.931
Use that.
Grab that to secure the line.

13:21.975 --> 13:23.411
If that line bursts,

13:23.454 --> 13:25.500
this entire ship will go
off like a daisy cutter.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.157
Get your hand out of that.

13:34.683 --> 13:36.380
[grunting]

13:38.034 --> 13:40.123
[powers down]

13:40.167 --> 13:43.605
Line secured. Pressure
in the ship decreasing.

13:48.479 --> 13:50.612
All good.

13:50.655 --> 13:53.571
Stress on the hull decreasing.

13:55.008 --> 13:57.662
We stabilized, Jennifer?

13:57.706 --> 13:59.795
33 degrees post-side lead,

13:59.839 --> 14:01.928
-Decrease to 15.
-Decreasing.

14:01.971 --> 14:03.712
All right, everyone.
Strap back in.

14:05.496 --> 14:07.759
In Pandora'’s orbit,
we want to be more careful.

14:12.373 --> 14:16.768
So, is your husband
a Space Force pilot?

14:16.812 --> 14:20.163
He is. We went
through the academy together.

14:26.735 --> 14:29.042
I can use him up here
instead of at his university.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.045
He knows.

14:32.088 --> 14:34.134
Get'’s underestimated
all the time.

14:34.177 --> 14:36.266
Unlike you, huh?

14:36.310 --> 14:39.182
Space Force disease Specialist,
best in the world?

14:39.226 --> 14:41.924
That title has an
expiration date.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.317
Every morning.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.537
Yeah.

14:46.581 --> 14:48.670
Frank, give me a damage report.

14:50.672 --> 14:52.804
The ship took some
damage in the wormhole.

14:52.848 --> 14:54.284
Primarily the upper deck.

14:54.328 --> 14:56.156
Power is down 50%.

14:56.199 --> 14:57.766
No way we are getting
through that again

14:57.809 --> 14:59.637
without maintenance
and structural repairs.

14:59.681 --> 15:03.293
Is it me or is your AI
getting more conversational?

15:03.337 --> 15:06.383
Well, it'’s programmed to learn
human personality traits.

15:06.427 --> 15:08.255
It'’s starting to pick up
some of mine.

15:08.298 --> 15:10.779
Minimum threshold to
withstand quantum events

15:10.822 --> 15:13.651
and not have
the ship break up is what?

15:13.695 --> 15:15.827
60% thrust?

15:15.871 --> 15:17.220
88%.

15:17.264 --> 15:19.396
What about those nitro reserves?

15:19.440 --> 15:21.268
If we absolutely had to,

15:21.311 --> 15:24.445
could we use the sodium
ion thruster as a backup?

15:24.488 --> 15:25.968
Yes, but that thruster
exceeding

15:26.012 --> 15:28.057
its 10,000 degree
Fahrenheit minimum

15:28.101 --> 15:29.972
is almost guaranteed.

15:30.016 --> 15:33.193
Past 10,000 degrees, the ship
will overheat and combust.

15:33.236 --> 15:37.284
Better to repair the current
thrusters to 88% capacity.

15:37.327 --> 15:39.634
Thanks, Frank.

15:39.677 --> 15:43.246
You got it. I will continue
diagnostic, internal repairs.

15:43.290 --> 15:45.205
Energy efficiency measures.

15:45.248 --> 15:48.121
So, 88% minimum power
to get us back?

15:48.164 --> 15:49.165
88%.

15:53.691 --> 15:55.955
We have now entered
Pandora'’s orbit.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.836
[whistles]

16:07.879 --> 16:11.318
Man, that moon is no joke.

16:11.361 --> 16:13.929
A lot more jagged
than I thought it would be.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.975
What kind of navy
is Pandora, anyways?

16:18.020 --> 16:19.152
The Greek mythology kind.

16:20.849 --> 16:24.896
That moon was discovered
in 1980, by the Voyager-1 probe.

16:24.940 --> 16:29.553
In 85, they renamed it Pandora
after the Box of Mysteries.

16:29.597 --> 16:33.340
Yeah, I don'’t really know
if I want to see what'’s inside.

16:33.383 --> 16:36.604
Pandora was a beautiful
woman sent by the gods.

16:36.647 --> 16:39.389
with a box she was
told to never open.

16:39.433 --> 16:42.436
However,
curiosity got the best of her,

16:42.479 --> 16:46.353
and supposedly, she released
all the evils into the world.

16:48.007 --> 16:52.098
Of course, these stories
always blame a woman.

16:52.141 --> 16:55.188
Adam and Eve,
Samson and Delilah.

16:55.231 --> 17:00.367
Well, some interpretations say
Pandora opened it on purpose.

17:00.410 --> 17:04.632
Others believe she tried
to stop it, keeping hope inside.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.331
Meaning what?

17:08.375 --> 17:10.507
That no matter
how bad things get,

17:10.551 --> 17:13.467
we still always have hope.

17:13.510 --> 17:16.209
Great. Thanks for that,
Robert Frost.

17:16.252 --> 17:17.775
All right,
let'’s get to the medical ship

17:17.819 --> 17:19.081
and load our supplies.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.214
Our goal here is
to save lives, Colonel.

17:31.441 --> 17:34.879
Disengaging Arcturus medical
shuttle for Pandora Landing.

17:37.230 --> 17:39.101
Where are we, Frank?

17:39.145 --> 17:42.539
They'’re going to take
17.2 days to repair, Commander.

17:42.583 --> 17:43.845
We can use the sodium
ion thrusters.

17:43.888 --> 17:45.238
Again, they'’re untested,

17:45.281 --> 17:48.763
so that will be considered
a last resort.

17:48.806 --> 17:51.940
[sighs]

17:51.983 --> 17:57.163
Bring up the last
known coordinates of Cassini 3.

17:57.206 --> 17:58.860
This will help
keep you more alert.

18:04.779 --> 18:07.695
Let'’s take her down
at a one click distance.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.262
I wouldn'’t want to risk anything
less than a half a mile.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.873
from Cassini'’s LZ.

18:11.916 --> 18:14.571
I strongly suggest
we don'’t land near any craters.

18:14.615 --> 18:17.618
Easier said than done,
professor.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.533
Pandora'’s
practically all craters.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.796
Yes, and many are shallow,

18:21.839 --> 18:23.798
a result of debris over time,
as we all know.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.845
But don'’t let that
porous surface fool you.

18:27.889 --> 18:30.152
My studies suggest that it might
be just that:

18:30.196 --> 18:31.849
a surface that may
crack to reveal

18:31.893 --> 18:34.156
a large body
of water beneath it.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.940
Especially in
those two largest craters.

18:35.984 --> 18:37.768
That has never
been substantiated.

18:37.812 --> 18:39.553
Because the photos of
Pandora have been too distant

18:39.596 --> 18:42.382
to clarify the contents of
the deepest and darkest craters.

18:42.425 --> 18:46.255
Which is why Cassini 3
went there in the first place.

18:46.299 --> 18:49.345
Against the better
judgment of many.

18:49.389 --> 18:50.825
I don'’t mean to butt heads, but

18:50.868 --> 18:53.958
fear of the unknown
is childish, Colonel.

18:54.002 --> 18:55.569
Scientists have always
concluded that it'’s impossible

18:55.612 --> 18:58.659
for life to be supported
on Saturn as we know it.

18:58.702 --> 19:00.095
But the moons
are a different matter

19:00.139 --> 19:01.705
If Pandora
has internal oceans like

19:01.749 --> 19:02.706
the ones on Encladius
and Titan...

19:02.750 --> 19:04.447
Calm down, professor.

19:04.491 --> 19:05.535
First things first.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.973
Let'’s concentrate on landing
this thing, huh?

19:09.017 --> 19:10.584
What do you say?

19:10.627 --> 19:14.065
-Preparing for final descent.
-Prepare final descent.

19:14.109 --> 19:16.546
Thrusters up to 44%.

19:19.375 --> 19:22.378
The Arcturus medical transport
has landed on Pandora.

19:28.079 --> 19:30.299
Look at all the plant life.
This is crazy.

19:34.347 --> 19:36.044
Careful with the ground, guys.

19:36.087 --> 19:39.134
The terrain
is slippery and unstable.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.180
Typical of outer planets,
right professor?

19:42.790 --> 19:44.226
It'’s not the ground that we have
to worry about.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.228
It'’s what's trapped
inside of it.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.229
Speaking of which.

19:47.273 --> 19:48.361
[beeping]

19:54.932 --> 19:56.325
Got eyes on the Cassini.

19:58.284 --> 20:02.940
My God. The atmospheric
corrosion is disintegrating it.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.246
Hear that? Come on. Let'’s make
a b-line for the Cassini.

20:05.334 --> 20:06.857
No, wait. Listen.

20:08.468 --> 20:10.426
The ruts created
by the crash aren'’t consistent

20:10.470 --> 20:12.602
with the Cassini'’s location.

20:12.646 --> 20:14.778
It'’s almost
like it was placed there.

20:14.822 --> 20:18.260
-Are you saying this is a trap?
-No.

20:18.304 --> 20:19.870
The Chinese and
the Russian forces

20:19.914 --> 20:22.003
wouldn'’t have
any interest in Pandora.

20:22.046 --> 20:23.570
There'’s no mining
opportunities here.

20:25.746 --> 20:29.184
Look, even if there are
foreign Space Force troops

20:29.228 --> 20:31.926
or even alien life forms,

20:31.969 --> 20:34.494
they are done.

20:36.017 --> 20:39.281
Randolph is a tactical expert.

20:39.325 --> 20:43.459
Ali is the best field
communications operative I know.

20:43.503 --> 20:47.246
And Wanda is trained in every
killing technique imagined.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.815
Jen?

20:55.950 --> 20:58.866
All right, you'’re right.

20:58.909 --> 21:01.172
Let'’s get to the craft
and check on the crew.

21:01.216 --> 21:02.173
-Come on.
-Let'’s go.

21:02.217 --> 21:03.871
Come on, come on.

21:05.916 --> 21:07.918
We got ya. Let'’s go.
Let'’s go.

21:13.576 --> 21:14.969
That'’s a real treat.

21:15.012 --> 21:17.450
Get to experience
a Pandora light shift.

21:17.493 --> 21:19.887
The sun reflecting off Saturn
makes it happen in a flash.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.323
Look, there'’s the Cassini.

21:26.459 --> 21:30.071
Yes, they travel through
the Alexian wormhole same as us.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.423
It looks like that ship'’s
been underwater for years.

21:34.467 --> 21:38.035
But water from where?

21:38.079 --> 21:41.212
This might
answer your question.

21:41.256 --> 21:42.170
Damn.

21:43.258 --> 21:44.564
Water.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.437
Crazy.

21:48.481 --> 21:50.787
Do you think they
could be out there?

21:50.831 --> 21:52.180
There'’s no sign of them.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.318
There'’s something
moving in the water.

22:02.016 --> 22:03.365
What is that?

22:03.409 --> 22:06.020
Fall back,
Richard. Fall back.

22:09.197 --> 22:10.154
Richard, fall back!

22:20.991 --> 22:23.777
The ship!
That'’s the Cassini 3!

22:27.563 --> 22:28.956
Why is it taking off?

22:33.134 --> 22:35.571
Cassini 3 is coming
towards our ship, Commander.

22:35.615 --> 22:37.834
Cassini, you are to
to remain on Pandora

22:37.878 --> 22:39.749
until Dr. Ryan has
completed her evaluation.

22:39.793 --> 22:42.186
-Do you copy?
-We'’ve got thermal readings.

22:42.230 --> 22:45.494
We do not detect any human heat
signatures aboard that ship.

22:45.538 --> 22:46.930
It'’s flying by itself.

22:46.974 --> 22:48.410
Cassini 3, Cassini 3,

22:48.454 --> 22:51.413
this is the Luna-One.
Keep your distance.

22:51.457 --> 22:54.547
If you come any closer,
you will be considered hostile.

22:54.590 --> 22:55.722
Firing, one through four.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.076
[shouting]

23:05.253 --> 23:07.211
-Hit it?
-I don'’t think so.

23:07.255 --> 23:10.519
I think we might have
injured it or something.

23:11.781 --> 23:13.087
Circle up.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.655
If this thing attacks again,

23:15.698 --> 23:17.787
we lay down fire
and set up a perimeter

23:17.831 --> 23:20.355
for the med team
to evac back to the ship.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.052
-Copy me?
-Yes, sir.

23:22.096 --> 23:23.184
-Absolutely, sir.
-Copy that.

23:23.227 --> 23:24.272
Roger.

23:24.315 --> 23:26.143
Cliff, Jennifer, what'’s your 20?

23:26.187 --> 23:28.232
We'’re inside a shallow crater
about 50 yards west of you.

23:28.276 --> 23:29.712
You'’re here
for real time assessments,

23:29.756 --> 23:30.974
and we need one now.

23:31.018 --> 23:32.933
What are we fighting here?

23:32.976 --> 23:35.283
Stand by, Colonel.
You'’re going to find out.

23:35.326 --> 23:36.589
We'’re going to
continue to cover you in case

23:36.632 --> 23:37.894
this thing comes back at us.

23:37.938 --> 23:40.462
But I need you
out of there yesterday.

23:40.506 --> 23:42.203
On the same page.
Colonel.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.120
Jen, where are you going?

23:46.163 --> 23:47.295
I see bodies.

23:51.386 --> 23:54.389
Are they dead?

23:54.433 --> 23:55.912
They must have been
attacked like we were.

23:57.958 --> 24:00.221
This one'’s oxygen level is low,
but it isn'’t empty.

24:00.264 --> 24:01.440
So he didn'’t suffocate to death.

24:01.483 --> 24:02.353
Neither did this one.

24:04.181 --> 24:05.531
So what--

24:05.574 --> 24:07.402
[screaming]

24:07.446 --> 24:08.925
They'’re alive.
We have to get them back

24:08.969 --> 24:11.450
to the med center immediately.

24:11.493 --> 24:13.364
Step away, Dr. Ryan.

24:13.408 --> 24:15.279
This is the research team,

24:15.323 --> 24:16.498
it'’s the people we came to save.

24:16.542 --> 24:17.891
Not if they'’ve been compromised.

24:17.934 --> 24:19.370
What does that mean?

24:19.414 --> 24:21.068
If they are sick,
let me help them.

24:21.111 --> 24:22.548
That'’s why I'm here.

24:22.591 --> 24:24.114
If they'’ve been out
here for all this time,

24:24.158 --> 24:25.551
how are they still alive?

24:25.594 --> 24:27.422
Perhaps I can
answer your questions.

24:27.466 --> 24:28.510
Get back!

24:28.554 --> 24:29.468
Ten paces.

24:30.643 --> 24:34.647
I mean no harm.
This is my team.

24:34.690 --> 24:36.866
My name'’s Captain Greg Black,

24:36.910 --> 24:39.478
and I'’m the leader
of this expedition, okay?

24:39.521 --> 24:41.044
Sophie, you with me?

24:43.133 --> 24:44.700
Greg.

24:45.875 --> 24:46.789
It'’s Jen.

24:48.356 --> 24:51.054
Jennifer Ryan.
We came to rescue you.

24:52.708 --> 24:55.711
You came all
this way to find us?

24:58.018 --> 24:59.672
Of course.

24:59.715 --> 25:02.457
Thank God you found us.

25:02.501 --> 25:05.591
Okay, we'’re all running
out of air. We gotta go.

25:05.634 --> 25:07.767
We have to get them
back to the ship immediately.

25:07.810 --> 25:10.160
All right,
the situation has changed.

25:10.204 --> 25:13.076
This is now
a hostile environment.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.122
I thought I was giving
the orders when it came

25:15.165 --> 25:16.427
to the rescue mission, Colonel.

25:18.038 --> 25:19.909
Get them back to
the ship for treatment,

25:19.953 --> 25:21.998
but hold your position.

25:22.042 --> 25:24.348
My team and I are going
to first secure the perimeter,

25:24.392 --> 25:25.480
and then we'’ll follow you.

25:27.395 --> 25:30.006
-Come on, let'’s go.
-Jennifer.

25:30.050 --> 25:30.964
You got him?

25:32.835 --> 25:34.184
Good.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.669
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

25:48.634 --> 25:50.026
[beeping]

25:52.942 --> 25:55.815
I'’m running a fine point signal
to break through the wormhole.

25:55.858 --> 26:01.124
Lewis, that was a
$5 billion spacecraft.

26:01.168 --> 26:03.213
I'’m assuming you had
good reason for your actions.

26:04.301 --> 26:05.825
It was hostile and probably

26:05.868 --> 26:07.174
under the control
of an unknown enemy lifeform.

26:09.611 --> 26:12.919
-How many human casualties?
-Undetermined.

26:12.962 --> 26:14.834
No heat signals
detected aboard the craft,

26:14.877 --> 26:16.531
so either
ship was flying itself--

26:16.575 --> 26:18.359
Stop.

26:18.402 --> 26:19.839
Where are Dr. Ryan and Colonel
Bradley'’s team Currently?

26:19.882 --> 26:22.189
On Pandora.

26:26.193 --> 26:28.587
You listen to me
very carefully, Commander.

26:29.979 --> 26:33.896
Know when, I repeat,
no one gets back

26:33.940 --> 26:35.985
on your ship
until I approve them.

26:36.029 --> 26:37.378
Is that understood?

26:37.421 --> 26:39.598
Very loud and
crystal clear.

26:41.121 --> 26:42.862
Commander, if your ship
becomes compromised,

26:42.905 --> 26:45.081
the DoD will have no choice
but to consider you a hostile.

26:45.125 --> 26:46.953
I know the DoD'’s orders.

26:46.996 --> 26:49.216
They'’ll shoot me down with a
heat-seeking tactical nuke,

26:49.259 --> 26:52.175
but we'’ll be traveling
with momentum of a wormhole.

26:52.219 --> 26:53.916
We'’ll drag
the fallout straight to Earth.

26:53.960 --> 26:57.441
Yeah, the DoD is
well aware of that danger.

26:57.485 --> 27:00.923
Which is why they will
shoot a nuke into that wormhole

27:00.967 --> 27:02.925
the second they think
you'’ve been compromised.

27:02.969 --> 27:04.971
You won'’t even make
it halfway through, Commander.

27:05.014 --> 27:06.755
And there will be
nothing I can do about it.

27:08.539 --> 27:11.281
You'’ve been warned.
Get him out of here.

27:12.543 --> 27:13.501
[groans]

27:16.112 --> 27:17.636
It'’s not much further.

27:21.944 --> 27:24.817
Space Force must be concerned
we might be contaminated, huh?

27:28.908 --> 27:30.823
We all want to know what
happened to your team, Greg.

27:34.348 --> 27:35.915
So cold.

27:35.958 --> 27:37.612
We'’ll be inside soon.

27:37.656 --> 27:41.572
The good news is
that freezing out here

27:41.616 --> 27:43.357
closes your pores and
decreases your heart rate,

27:43.400 --> 27:45.315
which also slows your breathing.

27:45.359 --> 27:48.405
Otherwise, your oxygen probably
would have already been gone.

27:48.449 --> 27:49.885
Were you attacked?

27:51.670 --> 27:53.715
Don'’t remember.

27:53.759 --> 27:54.716
Me neither.

27:56.457 --> 27:58.328
One moment
we were in the crater.

27:58.372 --> 27:59.590
And the next...

28:01.114 --> 28:03.377
Thank God you came
in the nick of time, Jen.

28:05.509 --> 28:07.337
We have no time to lose.
Let'’s go, let's go.

28:07.381 --> 28:09.688
Come on.
Come on.

28:09.731 --> 28:11.167
Colonel, we are
bringing the Cassini crew

28:11.211 --> 28:12.647
to the medical shuttle.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.214
Copy that, Jennifer, stay safe.

28:14.257 --> 28:15.824
Perimeter secure, Colonel.

28:15.868 --> 28:17.521
I guess we'’re drove them back.

28:17.565 --> 28:19.567
What are you doing, Randy?

28:20.960 --> 28:22.831
I killed it.
I know I did.

28:24.615 --> 28:28.489
There'’s nothing here
but this sludge.

28:28.532 --> 28:32.493
But where are the bodies?
There should be some remains.

28:38.368 --> 28:41.937
That'’s enough.
Stand down.

28:41.981 --> 28:45.201
Ryan'’s found Black and
his research team and are

28:45.245 --> 28:47.464
taking them back to the medical
ship for observation.

28:47.508 --> 28:48.857
Once they'’ve been evaluated,

28:48.901 --> 28:51.599
we'’re going to launch
off this rock

28:51.642 --> 28:53.644
and finish this job from space.

28:53.688 --> 28:55.429
I'’m all for that.

28:55.472 --> 28:57.344
These things don'’t
take fire like humans.

28:57.387 --> 28:59.085
I mean, these weapons,

28:59.128 --> 29:03.045
these armor piercing hollow
points, cyclonic rotations.

29:03.089 --> 29:04.917
These things take down a tank.

29:04.960 --> 29:07.833
But these things just keep
on coming like it'’s nothing.

29:07.876 --> 29:09.965
Creatures, whatever they are.

29:15.275 --> 29:16.972
I'’ve got something.

29:19.627 --> 29:20.933
Ah!

29:20.976 --> 29:22.499
Oh, God!

29:22.543 --> 29:23.849
No, no!
It'’s got my leg!

29:23.892 --> 29:26.416
We got you.

29:28.201 --> 29:29.724
[monster roars]

29:30.899 --> 29:32.031
Where'’d he go?

29:33.641 --> 29:35.599
Where is he?

29:35.643 --> 29:36.949
It dragged him
under the water.

29:36.992 --> 29:38.994
-We need to go in after him.
-No.

29:39.038 --> 29:41.518
Fire all around
and drive them back.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.174
Sir, we can'’t see it!

29:45.218 --> 29:46.219
Do it now!

29:47.307 --> 29:48.264
[groaning]

29:49.918 --> 29:51.572
It'’s the water.

29:51.615 --> 29:54.183
What'’s in the water?

29:54.227 --> 29:56.620
It isthe water!

30:01.887 --> 30:04.063
No. Markus!
Markus!

30:04.106 --> 30:05.064
Markus?

30:12.506 --> 30:14.638
-Oh, God.
-What'’s that?

30:14.682 --> 30:15.944
Back, back, back.

30:17.685 --> 30:19.513
Get over here.

30:19.556 --> 30:20.688
[overlapping dialogue]

30:25.171 --> 30:28.783
Sir, if we don'’t have weapons
to take this out, we'’re done.

30:28.827 --> 30:29.828
We can'’t shoot at water.

30:31.090 --> 30:33.875
Go ghost mode.
Low and slow.

30:33.919 --> 30:35.485
Wanda, you'’re right.

30:35.529 --> 30:37.836
A spearheaded attack
means a death sentence for us.

30:37.879 --> 30:39.881
Sir, if they come after us
again, we'’ll have no choice.

30:39.925 --> 30:42.579
We'’ll have to open up fire
and draw them back to us.

30:42.623 --> 30:44.538
And then
we empty our reserve into them

30:44.581 --> 30:46.627
and do
a Hail Mary detonation.

30:46.670 --> 30:49.848
Blaze of glory.
Right, colonel?

30:49.891 --> 30:51.632
We get back to the LZ.

30:53.939 --> 30:56.202
Quietly.
That'’s the order.

30:57.290 --> 30:58.421
Move out.

31:00.641 --> 31:01.903
[groaning]

31:01.947 --> 31:03.209
All right, we made it.
We made it.

31:03.252 --> 31:04.384
Can you get him on the table?
Thank you.

31:04.427 --> 31:05.907
You got it? Go.

31:05.951 --> 31:07.082
All right, all right, all right.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.302
Keep it stable.

31:09.345 --> 31:10.694
Here, buddy.

31:10.738 --> 31:13.001
With me, buddy?

31:15.395 --> 31:19.225
[alarm sounds]

31:19.268 --> 31:21.401
It'’s the O2 regulator.

31:21.444 --> 31:23.969
The seals on the O2
filters are damaged.

31:24.012 --> 31:27.276
What? That is impossible.
That is a nano-iron polymer.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.322
There'’s triple
filtration in that line.

31:29.365 --> 31:31.672
Wait a second.

31:31.715 --> 31:33.674
Something'’s eating through
the metal seal of my regulator.

31:35.502 --> 31:38.548
My O2 line is showing
a high reading of ferrous oxide.

31:38.592 --> 31:40.724
Wait, so it'’s rust?

31:42.770 --> 31:43.727
[gasps]

31:46.382 --> 31:48.167
We'’ve got organisms
trying to break through

31:48.210 --> 31:49.908
the oxygen lines!
It'’s going through the suits.

31:52.258 --> 31:54.825
Greg, no. You can'’t expose
yourself to the outside air.

31:54.869 --> 31:56.436
Greg, stop.

31:56.479 --> 31:59.352
You could infect yourself.
You'’ll infect all of us.

31:59.395 --> 32:01.093
It'’s too late, Jen.

32:01.136 --> 32:03.443
If it'’s getting into
the suit through O2 line,

32:03.486 --> 32:05.575
we can'’t keep the helmets on.

32:05.619 --> 32:08.230
Look, I know you know
everything, and that'’s great,

32:08.274 --> 32:09.971
but I know
a few things two, okay?

32:10.015 --> 32:11.581
Including
the fact that we either

32:11.625 --> 32:14.236
keep these helmets on
and get infected instantly,

32:14.280 --> 32:18.893
or we take them off and we avoid
infection here aboard the ship.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.721
Okay, I'’m sorry.

32:20.764 --> 32:22.288
If I'’m going to die,
I'’m not going to die with some

32:22.331 --> 32:24.507
organism crawling into
my nose inside my helmet.

32:26.161 --> 32:27.771
Oh, God.

32:27.815 --> 32:30.470
Cliff. Cliff, we cannot
risk getting infected.

32:30.513 --> 32:32.298
Jennifer, we'’re guaranteed
to die right now.

32:32.341 --> 32:35.127
It'’s eaten through at least
one layer on our O2 lines.

32:35.170 --> 32:36.824
We gotta take off our
helmets and burn the regulators

32:36.867 --> 32:38.086
in our suit.

32:42.177 --> 32:43.222
We don'’t have a choice.

32:45.137 --> 32:46.616
Damn it.

32:48.096 --> 32:51.752
All right, everyone,
remove any contaminants

32:51.795 --> 32:53.536
and get them into
the incinerator ASAP.

33:20.085 --> 33:21.434
[incinerator burns]

33:23.871 --> 33:26.656
We immediately begin
a preventative battery

33:26.700 --> 33:27.962
from our medkits.
Give me a hand.

33:29.529 --> 33:33.272
Jen, please tell me
you have backup spacesuits

33:33.315 --> 33:35.230
aboard this ship.

33:35.274 --> 33:40.061
No, no. All the other
suits are up on Luna-One.

33:40.105 --> 33:43.108
Wait. This med
pack hasn'’t been open.

33:43.151 --> 33:44.848
You were compromised
in the field

33:44.892 --> 33:47.677
and no one received
medical attention?

33:50.115 --> 33:54.119
Sorry. Truthfully, I thought
it was too late for everybody.

33:54.162 --> 33:57.296
It'’s all a blur.
It all happened so fast.

33:57.339 --> 33:59.994
I'’m going to prepare the
preventative battery for Kyle.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.865
Cliff, double check
Greg'’s medkit,

34:01.909 --> 34:03.911
make sure it'’s intact,
we need it.

34:20.101 --> 34:23.104
Nothing was used,
there'’s no contamination.

34:23.148 --> 34:26.499
Unopened 500 milliliter bag,
IV, bandages,

34:26.542 --> 34:28.327
sutures, penicillin.

34:28.370 --> 34:31.286
Unopened? Why didn'’t he
try using any of this stuff?

34:31.330 --> 34:32.461
I don'’t trust him.

34:32.505 --> 34:33.549
[shuddering]

34:36.509 --> 34:37.771
Greg.

34:42.341 --> 34:44.169
He'’s not breathing.

34:44.212 --> 34:46.214
Get a blanket for him.
He'’s freezing.

34:47.911 --> 34:49.913
What'’s going on?
What is this?

34:49.957 --> 34:51.437
What is this?

34:51.480 --> 34:53.091
Clear, clear, clear.

34:53.134 --> 34:54.309
[groaning]

34:54.353 --> 34:56.659
Is he okay?
Is he okay?

34:56.703 --> 35:00.794
If it'’s airborne,
it'’s already in the air.

35:00.837 --> 35:02.230
You don'’t think that
already occurred to me?

35:08.845 --> 35:10.673
I'’m giving him a thousand
milliliter drip of saline.

35:12.893 --> 35:14.677
You all right?
Sophie, how are you feeling?

35:15.983 --> 35:17.854
Afraid out of my mind.

35:17.898 --> 35:21.249
I'’m normal.
I feel normal.

35:21.293 --> 35:24.513
Our mission
is severely compromised now.

35:24.557 --> 35:27.690
We will need a total medsat
eval, decontamination,

35:27.734 --> 35:30.040
and an endless
list of DoD failsafes.

35:30.084 --> 35:32.826
They could keep us in orbit
for weeks when we get back.

35:39.267 --> 35:40.181
Stable for now.

35:41.269 --> 35:43.097
How are you two feeling?

35:43.141 --> 35:46.013
She'’s good.
I think I'’m good.

35:46.056 --> 35:48.537
So I'’ve heard.

35:48.581 --> 35:50.496
So you'’ve heard?

35:50.539 --> 35:54.021
You seem to know me,
but I don'’t think I know you.

35:54.064 --> 35:55.544
We do.

35:55.588 --> 35:57.111
Cliff Ryan.

35:57.155 --> 36:00.549
When I left Space Force,
you took my position.

36:00.593 --> 36:02.464
We videochatted once.

36:02.508 --> 36:06.076
Oh, good. I'’m happy she tells
you all the good stories then.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.991
Thanks, Jen.

36:08.035 --> 36:11.865
It'’s nice to meet you in person,
despite the odd circumstances.

36:13.388 --> 36:15.608
Yeah, Jen'’s told me
a lot about you.

36:16.696 --> 36:18.437
Sounds like a lot of fun.

36:21.004 --> 36:23.181
Your hands are ice cold.

36:25.661 --> 36:28.360
Sorry, I didn'’t mean to
scare you. I hadn'’t noticed.

36:29.796 --> 36:33.234
Oh, my God.
Are your fingers numb?

36:33.278 --> 36:36.063
Yeah, a bit,
now that you mention it.

36:36.106 --> 36:39.284
You both need to be
checked for hypothermia.

36:39.327 --> 36:41.024
Do you have any idea how
long you were out there?

36:41.068 --> 36:46.465
No. It'’s all a blur.
It happened so fast.

36:47.553 --> 36:48.858
What happened?

36:48.902 --> 36:51.600
I'’m a little vague
with this... It.

36:51.644 --> 36:53.907
Confusion could be a sign of
hypothermia,

36:53.950 --> 36:55.213
along shivering and memory loss.

36:56.997 --> 36:59.260
All right, we need to get
you both warmed up, okay?

36:59.304 --> 37:01.001
Not too rapidly.

37:01.044 --> 37:04.091
Warming up too quick
can cause heart arrhythmia.

37:04.134 --> 37:06.659
The water.
It was the water.

37:08.661 --> 37:10.967
We were investigating
the waters in the craters,

37:11.011 --> 37:13.883
collecting samples, and then...

37:13.927 --> 37:16.973
That'’s when Kyle and Sophie
got pulled under.

37:17.017 --> 37:18.453
That'’s the last thing
I remember.

37:18.497 --> 37:19.715
You were attacked?

37:21.717 --> 37:23.806
You managed
to make it back to the ship

37:23.850 --> 37:25.504
and send the distress call.

37:25.547 --> 37:28.507
Yeah, I managed.
I sent the call

37:28.550 --> 37:30.160
and that'’s when
everything goes blank.

37:32.380 --> 37:34.339
Wait, they got you, too?

37:34.382 --> 37:38.168
No, the ship lost power.

37:38.212 --> 37:39.909
All communications went down.

37:41.998 --> 37:43.652
This whole planet...

37:43.696 --> 37:46.612
The sooner we get off this
godforsaken Pandora, the better.

37:49.136 --> 37:50.703
Colonel Bradley.

37:50.746 --> 37:53.140
Colonel Bradley,
this is Dr. Ryan.

37:53.183 --> 37:54.837
Can you read me?

37:54.881 --> 37:56.796
We'’ve gotten Dr. Black
and his team to the ship.

37:56.839 --> 37:58.537
Are you on your way? Over.

38:04.891 --> 38:05.848
Maybe he'’s out of range?

38:07.415 --> 38:09.156
This lab is very well insulated.

38:09.199 --> 38:11.114
It'’s possible a radio
signal can'’t get through.

38:11.158 --> 38:13.595
I'’ll have to try and reach him
from the flight deck.

38:13.639 --> 38:15.423
If they'’re still reachable.

38:15.467 --> 38:17.077
You know what?
That is not helpful right now.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.645
We have no idea
what'’s going on out there.

38:19.688 --> 38:22.865
If anyone should know,
it should be you.

38:22.909 --> 38:25.738
I'’ve suspected about a decade
now that there might be water

38:25.781 --> 38:29.132
on this planet, which could
mean some form of life.

38:29.176 --> 38:30.786
But I never expected this.

38:34.094 --> 38:35.008
Did you?

38:36.923 --> 38:39.229
No, of course not.
Not to this degree.

38:39.273 --> 38:44.496
These creatures, they..
They don'’t live as individuals.

38:44.539 --> 38:47.542
They join together
as a more powerful unit,

38:47.586 --> 38:50.023
like a hive, so to speak.

38:51.720 --> 38:55.115
So it'’s not the air,
they survive on the water?

38:56.812 --> 39:01.164
Like parasitic protozoa,
Toxoplasma gondii,

39:01.208 --> 39:05.125
Entamoeba histolytica,
Cyclospora cayetanensis...

39:05.168 --> 39:07.083
They'’re all different
kinds of parasites

39:07.127 --> 39:09.434
that can cause
disease or infections.

39:09.477 --> 39:12.915
Great, so now we have
another thing to worry about.

39:15.178 --> 39:17.093
Okay, you know, look,
how about

39:17.137 --> 39:22.142
Cliff makes everyone
some soup, maybe tea.

39:22.185 --> 39:23.752
You could both
use hot liquids.

39:25.624 --> 39:28.670
I will go to the flight deck,
contact Commander Lewis

39:28.714 --> 39:31.151
and see if he can get in
touch with Colonel Bradley.

39:32.239 --> 39:33.719
Thanks, Jen.

39:37.636 --> 39:39.072
Oh, man.

39:42.771 --> 39:45.426
Hang in there, Kyle.

39:45.470 --> 39:47.036
Got this, buddy.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.517
Let'’s go.
Low and slow.

39:49.561 --> 39:53.521
Colonel, I'’ve got
a destabilization alarm.

39:53.565 --> 39:56.219
The surface is
moving beneath us.

39:56.263 --> 39:57.873
Just keep moving.

39:59.048 --> 40:00.920
What is on this moon, Colonel?

40:00.963 --> 40:03.705
It killed Marcus,
and I'’m not going out like that.

40:03.749 --> 40:06.534
You think the government
knew what was out here?

40:06.578 --> 40:09.232
Keep moving. And no,
there'’s no way they knew

40:09.276 --> 40:10.538
the extent of this threat.

40:10.582 --> 40:12.322
Let'’s just get back
to the ship,

40:12.366 --> 40:14.977
reconnect with Luna-One
and evac to orbit.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.463
[screams]

40:24.073 --> 40:26.032
No, this way!
No, no, no, let'’s go!

40:36.825 --> 40:38.348
Luna-One,
this is Arcturus.

40:39.959 --> 40:43.092
Greetings. What'’s your
status report, Dr. Ryan?

40:43.136 --> 40:44.659
We'’ve located Dr. Black
and his team

40:44.703 --> 40:46.400
and have gotten
them back on the ship.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.794
They'’re in the medical ward now,
receiving treatment.

40:48.837 --> 40:50.535
What is their condition?

40:50.578 --> 40:54.669
Slight to severe cases of
hypothermia, low pulse rates.

40:54.713 --> 40:56.149
In need of more
medical attention

40:56.192 --> 40:57.977
than I can provide here.

40:58.020 --> 41:01.110
They encountered an
unknown entity on Pandora

41:01.154 --> 41:03.765
that appears hostile in nature.

41:03.809 --> 41:06.507
We were separated from
Colonel Bradley and his team.

41:06.551 --> 41:08.074
Bradley and what'’s left of his
unit are on the way back to you,

41:08.117 --> 41:10.511
but have encountered more--

41:10.555 --> 41:11.599
[rumbling]

41:11.643 --> 41:12.600
Commander, please repeat that.

41:12.644 --> 41:16.561
Creatures. Water creatures?

41:16.604 --> 41:18.911
They just took out one
of Bradley'’s team members.

41:18.954 --> 41:20.303
Uh...

41:20.347 --> 41:22.828
Commander, we are
experiencing unusual

41:22.871 --> 41:24.699
seismic activity on the surface.

41:24.743 --> 41:28.007
Request permission to reunite
with the Luna-One immediately.

41:28.050 --> 41:29.965
That is a negative, Dr. Ryan.

41:30.009 --> 41:32.054
Space Force has requested
DoD level rundowns

41:32.098 --> 41:34.317
and health diagnostics
on all crew members.

41:34.361 --> 41:38.539
That info was to be vetted
by CDC, CIA, Hazmat, NASA,

41:38.583 --> 41:40.672
among others.

41:40.715 --> 41:43.762
I understand their concern,
Commander,

41:43.805 --> 41:46.286
but we can at least
remain quarantined

41:46.329 --> 41:48.070
while docked to your ship.

41:48.114 --> 41:51.334
We need a remote eval on your
data from agencies on Earth.

41:51.378 --> 41:53.511
Commander, our ship
is contained.

41:53.554 --> 41:54.903
I'’m sorry, Jennifer.

41:54.947 --> 41:56.296
Docking to my ship'’s denied.

42:04.173 --> 42:06.349
Commander Lewis,
our ship is functional.

42:06.393 --> 42:07.916
No damage to the hull.

42:07.960 --> 42:11.790
Frank, If NASA is running
a fine point signal to

42:11.833 --> 42:17.404
communicate with us, then
what are our telemetrics doing?

42:17.447 --> 42:20.538
They are also finepoint.
It'’s a light-based signal.

42:20.581 --> 42:24.498
Light speed.
Shared DoD database real time.

42:24.542 --> 42:27.501
So they'’ll know if
we let the medship dock.

42:27.545 --> 42:30.025
The signal is subject to
wormhole fluctuations,

42:30.069 --> 42:32.550
but there is a 76% chance yes.

42:34.377 --> 42:37.555
-Thank you.
-Did Space Force say why?

42:41.210 --> 42:43.473
Safety precaution.
Standard protocol.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.267
For planet Earth.

43:10.370 --> 43:12.546
How are you two doing?

43:12.590 --> 43:14.940
Any shallow breathing?
Slurred speech?

43:17.682 --> 43:20.119
Little rattled
from the seismic jolts.

43:20.162 --> 43:23.426
Other than that,
just general exhaustion.

43:24.863 --> 43:26.604
Any word on when
we can get out of here?

43:28.083 --> 43:30.564
Colonel Bradley'’s on his way.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.218
Maybe I should go back
out there and look for them.

43:32.261 --> 43:33.306
They may need my help.

43:33.349 --> 43:34.960
No. No way, Jen.

43:35.003 --> 43:36.788
Pandora is way more dangerous
than I ever expected.

43:36.831 --> 43:38.528
Plus you need
to conduct examinations

43:38.572 --> 43:40.313
on those two ASAP.

43:40.356 --> 43:45.753
The last thing we need back
on Earth is another pandemic.

43:45.797 --> 43:47.320
Agreed.

43:47.363 --> 43:49.931
Cliff ought to be the one
to go look for them.

43:49.975 --> 43:51.803
He knows the terrain.

43:55.110 --> 43:56.416
You'’re trying to
get rid of me, Greg?

43:59.158 --> 44:00.768
Relax, buddy.

44:00.812 --> 44:03.553
I'’m just
trying to see where we stand

44:03.597 --> 44:07.645
and expedite our departure
from this very unstable moon.

44:08.820 --> 44:10.648
We can'’t stay here forever.

44:12.432 --> 44:13.781
It'’s not safe.

44:17.872 --> 44:19.700
You'’ll be safe in here.

44:19.744 --> 44:22.224
Thanks, but,
are you sure about that?

44:27.534 --> 44:29.797
He'’s... He's getting
a little too hot.

44:32.408 --> 44:35.847
Maybe I should turn
the heat down on the table?

44:35.890 --> 44:39.677
You turned on
the heat on the table.

44:41.156 --> 44:44.420
You are never
to apply direct heat

44:44.464 --> 44:47.293
in cases of severe hypothermia,

44:47.336 --> 44:49.687
it can damage the skin and
cause a regular heartbeat

44:49.730 --> 44:52.254
so severe they can
stop his heart.

44:55.431 --> 44:56.737
Whoa!

44:58.478 --> 44:59.653
It'’s okay.

45:01.046 --> 45:02.830
[screaming]

45:09.576 --> 45:11.143
Ah!

45:21.370 --> 45:23.590
It was just an electric
blanket, right?

45:23.633 --> 45:26.288
That shouldn'’t have happened.

45:26.332 --> 45:28.421
So that'’s your official
medical evaluation?

45:28.464 --> 45:34.035
Look, what happened to Kyle
was not caused by that blanket.

45:34.079 --> 45:36.429
Something completely
flushed out of his system.

45:36.472 --> 45:39.214
I have never
seen anything like it.

45:39.258 --> 45:42.957
Do you have any idea what
you were exposed to out there?

45:43.001 --> 45:45.568
You think I could be
infected with what Kyle has?

45:49.224 --> 45:51.618
I need to
conduct more tests now.

45:51.661 --> 45:55.753
Take blood samples from both of
you, run a complete diagnostic.

45:55.796 --> 45:58.190
No way.
You'’re not touching me.

45:58.233 --> 46:00.540
You two both need to be
quarantined immediately.

46:00.583 --> 46:03.761
I wasn'’t out there. Jen,
that water never touched me.

46:03.804 --> 46:05.327
How do we know that?

46:05.371 --> 46:06.502
You'’re the one
who should be quarantined

46:06.546 --> 46:07.808
after what just happened.

46:07.852 --> 46:09.854
Cliff didn'’t kill anyone.

46:09.897 --> 46:11.333
Maybe it had
something to do with

46:11.377 --> 46:13.161
the change in oxygen levels.

46:13.205 --> 46:15.642
Or maybe you guys just have
no idea what you'’re doing.

46:15.685 --> 46:17.470
Okay, Sophie, calm down.

46:17.513 --> 46:20.386
Jen and I, we'’ve known each
other for a very long time.

46:20.429 --> 46:22.214
I trust her judgment, okay?

46:22.257 --> 46:23.868
No, if we need
medical attention,

46:23.911 --> 46:25.608
I want the kind
that we can get back on Earth.

46:25.652 --> 46:26.609
I'’m not going to get
experimented on like

46:26.653 --> 46:28.002
some kind of guinea pig.

46:28.046 --> 46:31.397
You are a risk to
everyone on this ship.

46:31.440 --> 46:33.399
So then you two get quarantined,

46:33.442 --> 46:36.402
and me and Gregory can drive
the ship back to Earth.

46:36.445 --> 46:38.230
You'’ve been exposed, right?

46:38.273 --> 46:40.493
Greg, I'’m sorry.

46:40.536 --> 46:42.364
We cannot take any
chances with you two.

46:43.931 --> 46:44.889
Sophie!

46:44.932 --> 46:46.281
What are you doing?

46:46.325 --> 46:48.936
I'’m not going
to end up like Kyle.

46:48.980 --> 46:50.851
What are you doing?

46:50.895 --> 46:52.200
Sophie, what are you doing?

46:52.244 --> 46:53.593
Open up, Dr. Ryan.

46:55.029 --> 46:56.770
No. Nobody gets inside.

46:56.814 --> 46:58.685
We can'’t leave them out there.
They could die.

46:58.728 --> 47:00.905
-They can die in here.
-She has a point.

47:00.948 --> 47:02.863
Hey, if you think we were
exposed to something,

47:02.907 --> 47:03.864
what about them?

47:03.908 --> 47:05.779
Huh? Huh?
What about them?

47:07.041 --> 47:08.042
-Cliff!
-Hey.

47:08.086 --> 47:09.478
[alarm blares]

47:09.522 --> 47:11.263
You don'’t
know what you'’ve done.

47:11.306 --> 47:13.004
Colonel, no!
Why isn'’t he quarantined?

47:13.047 --> 47:14.527
Colonel, stay back.

47:14.570 --> 47:15.833
-Drop the weapon.
-She'’s been infected?

47:15.876 --> 47:17.225
We don'’t know.

47:17.269 --> 47:18.879
Drop the weapon.
I'’m not asking twice.

47:18.923 --> 47:21.273
Sophie, look at me.
Trust me.

47:21.316 --> 47:23.710
Getting everyone killed
here isn'’t going to do any

47:23.753 --> 47:25.930
good for anyone, okay?

47:25.973 --> 47:27.801
Trust me.
You know what to do.

47:27.845 --> 47:29.237
Look at me.

47:33.241 --> 47:34.677
I don'’t feel so good.

47:34.721 --> 47:36.288
All right. That'’s
all I need to hear.

47:36.331 --> 47:40.118
Everyone in here needs
to isolate immediately. Now.

47:41.380 --> 47:42.555
Oh my God!

47:43.773 --> 47:44.774
Ah!

47:44.818 --> 47:45.863
Shoot her!

47:47.516 --> 47:48.430
Sophie!

47:51.738 --> 47:53.131
Is she dead?

47:53.174 --> 47:54.697
No. We set our weapons
to incapacitate her.

47:54.741 --> 47:56.395
She'’s just unconscious.

47:56.438 --> 47:59.180
She'’ll have a hell of
a bruise when she wakes up.

47:59.224 --> 48:01.704
Colonel Bradley, are you okay?

48:01.748 --> 48:03.489
Don'’t get too close to him.

48:06.013 --> 48:10.844
[shouting]

48:10.888 --> 48:12.715
In here, in here!

48:15.457 --> 48:18.460
It'’s okay! That's an isolation
chamber designed to protect

48:18.504 --> 48:21.202
anyone if an accident
were to contaminate the room.

48:21.246 --> 48:22.247
It'’s completely sealed.

48:22.290 --> 48:23.596
Nothing can get through.

48:23.639 --> 48:25.293
You got a contamination
cell somewhere?

48:25.337 --> 48:27.513
Down the port-side hallway.

48:27.556 --> 48:30.037
Go ahead.
We'’ll put them in there.

48:30.081 --> 48:32.126
No, you don'’t
want to lock me up.

48:32.170 --> 48:33.301
Look at me, Jen.

48:33.345 --> 48:35.651
I'’m begging you.
You know me.

48:35.695 --> 48:37.262
I'’m the one
who sent the distress call.

48:38.916 --> 48:40.918
I'’m trying to help you.

48:42.180 --> 48:44.095
You can'’t trust him.

48:44.138 --> 48:45.052
Your call, Doc.

48:46.140 --> 48:47.098
What?

48:47.141 --> 48:48.490
She'’s in charge now?

48:50.231 --> 48:52.103
On this medical ship? Yeah.

48:52.146 --> 48:53.495
She'’s the only expert we got.

48:56.411 --> 48:58.718
Okay.

48:58.761 --> 49:03.636
Put her in the holding room.
Second door on the left.

49:03.679 --> 49:07.422
And secure Dr. Black
to the examination table here.

49:07.466 --> 49:11.035
Use the locking wrist restraints
from our travel gurney.

49:11.078 --> 49:13.776
Really? It'’s not necessary,

49:13.820 --> 49:15.169
But I get it.

49:20.044 --> 49:22.829
How are we going to test
all of them and ourselves?

49:22.872 --> 49:24.048
Takes over an hour and a half

49:24.091 --> 49:25.788
to get verification
back from Earth.

49:25.832 --> 49:27.703
Whatever'’s out there
is going to kill us by then.

49:27.747 --> 49:31.707
Look, we either ram the
Luna-One, board it,

49:31.751 --> 49:33.883
then go back to
Earth and potentially infect

49:33.927 --> 49:38.540
the entire population,
or we test fast.

49:40.238 --> 49:41.326
This is my call.

49:43.067 --> 49:45.112
Lewis is going to need
an update and...

49:45.156 --> 49:46.679
from more than just one of us.

49:46.722 --> 49:49.377
Now that we'’re on Space Force
hazmat protocol.

49:49.421 --> 49:51.771
I'’ll go with you.

49:51.814 --> 49:53.468
Hey, Jen, don'’t you think
it'’d be a good idea

49:53.512 --> 49:56.341
to at least give me the
capability of stopping Bradley

49:56.384 --> 49:58.343
from pulling anything?

49:58.386 --> 50:00.910
No way., Greg.
I'’m sorry.

50:02.216 --> 50:04.392
Let'’s go.

50:06.003 --> 50:07.700
Officer Perkins,
when you'’ve secured her,

50:07.743 --> 50:09.832
I want one of you to guard
Dr. Black in the lab.

50:15.708 --> 50:17.188
So you don'’t trust Gregory?

50:19.103 --> 50:21.322
We don'’t know if he's
infected like the others.

50:21.366 --> 50:23.585
We can'’t put him
in the same room.

50:23.629 --> 50:25.152
There also aren'’t
any other secure

50:25.196 --> 50:26.197
quarantine areas on board.

50:27.546 --> 50:28.460
Let'’s go.

50:34.901 --> 50:37.599
Commander, come in. Commander.

50:39.036 --> 50:41.081
Been waiting to hear
from you guys.

50:41.125 --> 50:44.302
Did Colonel Bradley and
his team make it back safely?

50:44.345 --> 50:46.956
We need to leave now.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.134
Bradley and some of
the others are infected.

50:50.177 --> 50:52.875
I don'’t know how to
treat them from here.

50:52.919 --> 50:55.008
Elaborate on the word infected.

50:56.096 --> 50:58.403
Okay, um...

50:58.446 --> 51:03.147
There seems to be a parasitic
element to the water on Pandora,

51:03.190 --> 51:05.453
where it has
the ability to cloak itself

51:05.497 --> 51:08.500
in the water and
infiltrate living systems.

51:08.543 --> 51:11.329
When she says living systems,
she means people.

51:11.372 --> 51:13.287
It takes control
from the inside.

51:13.331 --> 51:16.116
It'’s taken control of Bradley
and Dr. Black'’s team.

51:16.160 --> 51:17.813
You should have seen what
it did to one of the researchers

51:17.857 --> 51:19.815
when it decided
to vacate his body.

51:19.859 --> 51:21.078
We'’d never seen
anything like it before.

51:22.949 --> 51:24.907
Is there a cure?

51:24.951 --> 51:27.997
A cure?

51:28.041 --> 51:31.740
I didn'’t know an organism
like this existed an hour ago.

51:31.784 --> 51:33.307
That...

51:33.351 --> 51:35.440
The closest thing
I could think of that exists

51:35.483 --> 51:38.704
on Earth is
the Naegleria fowleri amoeba.

51:38.747 --> 51:40.140
When one is infected,
it can cause

51:40.184 --> 51:42.447
a condition known as P.A.M.

51:42.490 --> 51:44.144
P.A.M.?

51:44.188 --> 51:47.930
Stands for primary amoeba
meningoencephalitis. Okay?

51:47.974 --> 51:49.758
It occurs when an amoeba makes

51:49.802 --> 51:51.499
its way up the nasal
pathogen into the brain

51:51.543 --> 51:54.415
and spinal cord,
destroying brain tissue.

51:54.459 --> 51:57.723
-Does P.A.M. have a cure?
-No.

51:57.766 --> 52:00.595
It is a 98.5% fatality rate.

52:00.639 --> 52:03.337
I have a feeling that what
we were dealing with

52:03.381 --> 52:08.081
could be very much
like PAM, but worse.

52:08.125 --> 52:13.391
Space Force will not risk
this orgasm making it to earth,

52:13.434 --> 52:16.481
being loose in our oceans
and the water we drink.

52:16.524 --> 52:19.397
Again, I know the
protocol, Commander.

52:21.529 --> 52:24.532
And technically, right now,

52:24.576 --> 52:27.187
there'’s nothing keeping
you here

52:27.231 --> 52:29.755
before the wormhole closes.
for six months.

52:29.798 --> 52:31.148
I could abort
this entire mission...

52:33.237 --> 52:34.542
and head back to Earth.

52:34.586 --> 52:36.718
But I'’ve not

52:36.762 --> 52:41.593
until we'’ve exhausted
all lifesaving options. Over.

52:43.725 --> 52:45.727
Okay.
Thank you, Commander.

52:47.512 --> 52:51.298
-How much time do I have?
-Two hours.

52:53.082 --> 52:54.519
The wormhole closes in
two hours.

52:56.869 --> 52:58.392
That doesn'’t give us
any time for control testing

52:58.436 --> 52:59.437
or genetics screening.

52:59.480 --> 53:01.961
No. No time for research.

53:03.789 --> 53:07.227
Seek and destroy,
not contain and study.

53:07.271 --> 53:09.969
We identify this parasite,
we kill it.

53:11.927 --> 53:13.364
We have two hours left.

53:49.095 --> 53:52.011
-What do you want?
-Who are you?

54:10.638 --> 54:12.945
What have we got here?

54:21.562 --> 54:23.651
I don'’t believe it.

54:23.695 --> 54:26.001
I don'’t believe it!
Frank!

54:26.045 --> 54:28.700
Frank, I need all the power
and our gunners at the ready.

54:55.379 --> 54:59.992
Commander, we need to launch
and get into orbit now.

55:00.035 --> 55:01.689
Negative, Doctor,
the air space around you

55:01.733 --> 55:02.951
is full of these tentacles.

55:04.562 --> 55:07.216
Is there any place safe
we can stage the ship?

55:07.260 --> 55:10.350
The ground'’s too unstable.
These quakes--

55:10.394 --> 55:11.743
As long as your ship

55:11.786 --> 55:13.005
and its passengers
have been compromised,

55:13.048 --> 55:15.660
you'’re not getting off Pandora.

55:15.703 --> 55:18.097
I have to get that back
through that wormhole

55:18.140 --> 55:20.578
if you can'’t contain
the situation, Dr. Ryan.

55:20.621 --> 55:22.710
We will find a solution.

55:22.754 --> 55:25.191
Commander, you need
to remain in orbit.

55:25.234 --> 55:27.019
Right now, you are
a national security threat.

55:27.062 --> 55:30.327
If I had to, I could
exit the wormhole right now.

55:30.370 --> 55:31.545
He could leave us for dead.

55:34.069 --> 55:36.420
Commander, can you read

55:36.463 --> 55:38.552
a permeable membrane
exoplasmic analysis

55:38.596 --> 55:40.902
with RNA strayations
on a microscope?

55:40.946 --> 55:42.687
-What are you talking about?
-Right.

55:42.730 --> 55:45.516
So if you don'’t even know
what no trace of alien life

55:45.559 --> 55:48.519
looks like, how can I
possibly convince you

55:48.562 --> 55:50.956
to let us dock to your ship?

55:52.784 --> 55:55.526
I would have
to take your...

55:58.572 --> 55:59.965
Good.

56:00.008 --> 56:04.709
We will eradicate the organism.
Do not evac.

56:10.192 --> 56:13.065
Randolph, keep your distance
from us, from everyone else.

56:13.108 --> 56:15.023
-Are we prepping a launch?
-No.

56:15.067 --> 56:16.764
The organism
searched the surface and

56:16.808 --> 56:18.810
splashing around our airspace
to keep us grounded.

56:18.853 --> 56:19.898
The water wants us trapped.

56:19.941 --> 56:21.682
[rumble]

56:21.726 --> 56:23.554
It also wants in.

56:23.597 --> 56:25.164
We need to barricade
ourselves against it.

56:25.207 --> 56:27.253
But how do we stop water?

56:27.296 --> 56:30.169
Jen, how do we secure
the ship if everyone'’s affected?

56:30.212 --> 56:31.388
Oil.

56:32.519 --> 56:35.087
Are you even listening to me?

56:35.130 --> 56:38.482
Oil is naturally repelled
by water and vice versa.

56:38.525 --> 56:41.441
-They are immiscible.
-Everybody knows that.

56:41.485 --> 56:43.965
But how does that stop a
gigantic conscious parasite?

56:44.009 --> 56:46.490
It'’s not like
pouring oil into a glass.

56:46.533 --> 56:50.885
No, but I am talking baseline
biological characteristics.

56:50.929 --> 56:53.148
Elasticity, viscosity.

56:53.192 --> 56:55.237
Water is a polar molecule.

56:55.281 --> 56:58.458
It has positively charged N and
a negatively charged N.

56:58.502 --> 57:00.329
Oil is nonpolar.

57:01.983 --> 57:04.769
It'’s trying to crack the hole.

57:06.161 --> 57:08.294
I know we can stop it!

57:08.337 --> 57:09.469
A nonpolar charge.

57:09.513 --> 57:11.602
It creates an ionized membrane

57:11.645 --> 57:13.473
that not only
water can'’t penetrate,

57:13.517 --> 57:15.344
but any membrane
organism inside of it.

57:16.781 --> 57:18.739
So where do we find this oil?

57:18.783 --> 57:20.262
It might seize up the launch,

57:20.306 --> 57:23.048
but there'’s a main
oil line in the engine.

57:23.091 --> 57:25.659
Randolph, get to
the engine room.

57:25.703 --> 57:27.748
Release the oil outtake valve.

57:27.792 --> 57:29.837
We need to find
a way to spray oil across

57:29.881 --> 57:31.578
as much of the hull as possible.

57:31.622 --> 57:35.321
That way the water
can'’t get into the ship.

57:37.192 --> 57:40.674
I can pour it into
barrels and dump it,

57:40.718 --> 57:43.372
but I can'’t do
that without a second hand.

57:43.416 --> 57:46.158
That also means there'’s going
to be two of us outside.

57:48.334 --> 57:49.901
I'’ll do it.

57:53.382 --> 57:54.906
Okay. Go.

57:54.949 --> 57:56.385
Let us know when
you'’re done covering the ship.

58:03.044 --> 58:05.307
You got a plan?

58:05.351 --> 58:07.745
More like a temporary Band-Aid.

58:07.788 --> 58:09.268
Hopefully to stop the water.

58:12.619 --> 58:16.144
Whoever you are,
you better stand down.

58:16.188 --> 58:20.061
One thing I do remember from my
time at the Space Force program

58:20.105 --> 58:24.326
was a study of
behavioral biology.

58:24.370 --> 58:27.242
Certain organisms
can and cannot react.

58:27.286 --> 58:29.157
You seized Bradley'’s brain

58:29.201 --> 58:31.246
and exhibits some
of his characteristics,

58:31.290 --> 58:34.989
but even then, you'’ll have
a tendency to overreact.

58:37.688 --> 58:40.952
-What'’s that?
-It'’s a medical atomizer.

58:40.995 --> 58:42.910
It'’s basically
a fancy perfume model,

58:42.954 --> 58:44.869
but for a variety of substances.

58:44.912 --> 58:46.131
Anything jumping off of me?

58:46.174 --> 58:47.436
Any subdermal disturbances?

58:47.480 --> 58:48.960
No.

58:49.003 --> 58:52.137
Sorry. Do you mind
elaborating on that, please?

58:55.488 --> 58:56.663
What is it?

58:56.707 --> 58:59.100
Sebum abstract.

58:59.144 --> 59:01.494
Lubricates the hair.

59:01.538 --> 59:05.324
And it also protects the skin.
And it'’s water resistant.

59:05.367 --> 59:07.456
It'’s a little bit like
the channel grease

59:07.500 --> 59:08.806
marathon swimmers use.

59:08.849 --> 59:12.287
It stops water absorption
into the pores.

59:12.331 --> 59:14.246
Why do you have it?

59:14.289 --> 59:15.464
It'’s basically a
moisturizing cream.

59:15.508 --> 59:16.901
Most women use it.

59:21.079 --> 59:22.036
Your turn.

59:29.653 --> 59:31.829
Head down. I don'’t want
you puking in my face.

59:39.706 --> 59:41.360
Thank you.

59:41.403 --> 59:42.404
Anything?

59:43.754 --> 59:44.929
Nothing.

59:59.900 --> 1:00:03.164
I'’ve seen some stuff,
and I'’ve seen even worse stuff.

1:00:04.731 --> 1:00:06.646
But this?

1:00:06.690 --> 1:00:09.606
See-through liquid aliens that
don'’t die when you shoot them?

1:00:11.085 --> 1:00:12.521
No.

1:00:12.565 --> 1:00:16.961
We just need to
get done and get back inside.

1:00:17.004 --> 1:00:19.877
You'’ve seen
what those things can do.

1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:23.968
Coating this ship is
only a defensive action.

1:00:25.143 --> 1:00:27.145
Sure, we'’re fine for now.

1:00:27.188 --> 1:00:32.193
But those things,
they can get huge, small.

1:00:34.239 --> 1:00:37.111
We need a legit offense,

1:00:38.852 --> 1:00:41.638
or we ain'’t making
it out of here.

1:00:41.681 --> 1:00:44.466
You got something in mind?
I'’d like to hear it.

1:00:47.948 --> 1:00:51.299
So when we were getting
the barrels,

1:00:51.343 --> 1:00:54.912
I saw some coolant
containers by the engine.

1:00:54.955 --> 1:00:57.915
Do you know anything
about liquid nitrogen?

1:00:57.958 --> 1:01:01.701
-Super pressurized, super cold.
-That'’s right.

1:01:01.745 --> 1:01:03.660
Freezes on contact.

1:01:05.139 --> 1:01:07.315
Might turn these
water aliens to ice.

1:01:12.669 --> 1:01:13.582
Let'’s get back inside.

1:01:24.550 --> 1:01:25.812
Incoming.

1:01:27.509 --> 1:01:28.772
It'’s working!

1:01:28.815 --> 1:01:30.251
The tentacles
are unable to attach.

1:01:35.039 --> 1:01:39.130
It worked. Dr. Ryan, the oil
barrier stopped the water.

1:01:39.173 --> 1:01:42.133
No damage reported.

1:01:42.176 --> 1:01:43.264
How'’d you know that'd work?

1:01:44.439 --> 1:01:46.790
Basic properties of water.

1:01:46.833 --> 1:01:49.575
I think this is an enemy
best being with science,

1:01:49.618 --> 1:01:50.837
and not just brute force.

1:01:52.447 --> 1:01:54.885
Hey, I don'’t mean to be a pain,
but still...

1:01:54.928 --> 1:01:58.105
We are not
out of the woods yet.

1:01:58.149 --> 1:01:59.237
I'’m sorry.

1:01:59.280 --> 1:02:00.804
So the spray wasn'’t enough?

1:02:00.847 --> 1:02:02.370
Not even close.

1:02:02.414 --> 1:02:03.807
If we'’re
going to rescue everyone,

1:02:03.850 --> 1:02:05.765
we need to
eradicate this.

1:02:05.809 --> 1:02:07.898
Jen, do we have time for that?

1:02:07.941 --> 1:02:09.726
We have to
incinerate Kyle'’s body,

1:02:09.769 --> 1:02:11.118
disinfect the ship,

1:02:11.162 --> 1:02:12.772
and then Lewis might let
us dock on Luna-One

1:02:12.816 --> 1:02:15.644
if we'’re not infected.

1:02:15.688 --> 1:02:18.256
Seek and destroy, remember?

1:02:18.299 --> 1:02:20.084
Now we destroy.

1:02:20.127 --> 1:02:22.303
Now...

1:02:22.347 --> 1:02:23.565
I still can'’t figure
out what caused the organisms

1:02:23.609 --> 1:02:25.176
to vacate Kyle

1:02:25.219 --> 1:02:27.787
or what made Sophie sick
enough to have them leave her

1:02:27.831 --> 1:02:29.180
and latch onto Bradley.

1:02:31.008 --> 1:02:32.705
Maybe the heat drives
them away,

1:02:32.749 --> 1:02:34.228
him with a heated blanket,

1:02:34.272 --> 1:02:35.577
and she was under
the vent before she started

1:02:35.621 --> 1:02:37.057
spewing all over the colonel.

1:02:37.101 --> 1:02:41.148
Yes, yes, heat can
absolutely evaporate water

1:02:41.192 --> 1:02:43.585
but that is an
external solution.

1:02:43.629 --> 1:02:45.805
We need an internal one.

1:02:45.849 --> 1:02:48.808
Prolonged exposure
to our oxygen levels.

1:02:48.852 --> 1:02:50.723
The atmosphere here on
Pandora is

1:02:50.767 --> 1:02:52.551
far different from
that on Earth.

1:02:52.594 --> 1:02:55.119
Hey, I'’m willing
to put an oxygen mask on

1:02:55.162 --> 1:02:57.121
to prove I'’m not infected.

1:02:57.164 --> 1:02:58.383
No.

1:02:58.426 --> 1:03:01.603
Why not?
It couldn'’t hurt.

1:03:01.647 --> 1:03:03.257
Okay.

1:03:03.301 --> 1:03:05.607
E-coli, norobirus, crypto.

1:03:05.651 --> 1:03:08.785
All sicknesses that can
be contracted in standing water.

1:03:08.828 --> 1:03:12.832
Pandora is almost
nothing but standing water.

1:03:12.876 --> 1:03:16.096
So... How does one
avoid catching one of those

1:03:16.140 --> 1:03:18.620
diseases in a swimming pool?

1:03:18.664 --> 1:03:20.187
Chlorine.

1:03:20.231 --> 1:03:22.320
What did
he come in contact with?

1:03:22.363 --> 1:03:24.496
Sodium chloride.

1:03:24.539 --> 1:03:26.541
They intravenous solutions
that I gave Kyle

1:03:26.585 --> 1:03:31.155
were a mixture
of warm saltwater. Saline.

1:03:31.198 --> 1:03:35.028
Harmless to humans,
maybe not to these parasites.

1:03:35.072 --> 1:03:36.551
You know how some
freshwater fish

1:03:36.595 --> 1:03:38.162
can'’t survive in salt water?

1:03:38.205 --> 1:03:39.990
The level of sodium
chloride is too high.

1:03:40.033 --> 1:03:41.295
It kills them.

1:03:44.821 --> 1:03:46.518
How do we test it?

1:03:46.561 --> 1:03:52.219
We give Colonel Bradley a small
dose of intravenous fluids.

1:03:52.263 --> 1:03:53.612
Let'’s see what happens.

1:04:05.276 --> 1:04:09.541
Maybe if we change
the PH level in our bodies,

1:04:09.584 --> 1:04:12.022
they can'’t survive it.

1:04:12.065 --> 1:04:14.328
They can'’t survive it.

1:04:23.294 --> 1:04:26.950
Jen, you all right?
Yeah, I'’m... I'm fine.

1:04:26.993 --> 1:04:30.214
I just, uh...
Just a bit exhausted.

1:04:42.617 --> 1:04:43.836
What did you do to her?

1:04:50.060 --> 1:04:53.933
What did I do to her?
That'’s a very good question.

1:04:55.021 --> 1:04:56.762
Nothing bad.

1:04:57.894 --> 1:04:59.156
But I'’m glad you asked.

1:05:00.984 --> 1:05:03.943
What patience it took...

1:05:03.987 --> 1:05:06.815
Sitting here
in the backseat while this

1:05:06.859 --> 1:05:11.429
so-called captain
operated this vessel.

1:05:14.040 --> 1:05:16.042
Bet he couldn'’t do that.

1:05:18.349 --> 1:05:21.743
Unfortunately for Kyle,

1:05:21.787 --> 1:05:25.443
he received a mere saline.

1:05:25.486 --> 1:05:29.621
I didn'’t have time to swap out
his IV, unfortunately for him.

1:05:29.664 --> 1:05:32.406
But if you

1:05:32.450 --> 1:05:37.890
paid attention to detail,

1:05:37.934 --> 1:05:39.196
you would have noticed.

1:05:41.198 --> 1:05:43.069
I filled Jen'’s IV...

1:05:44.897 --> 1:05:46.333
With us.

1:05:48.205 --> 1:05:50.947
You'’re one of them.

1:05:50.990 --> 1:05:53.427
I'’m one of them. Thank goodness.

1:05:53.471 --> 1:05:56.213
She'’s one of us. We are all...

1:05:56.256 --> 1:05:58.128
One.

1:05:58.171 --> 1:06:02.436
You humans are pure ignorance.

1:06:02.480 --> 1:06:06.527
All you ever do is
fight with one another.

1:06:06.571 --> 1:06:10.923
You will never be as strong
or as united as us.

1:06:12.359 --> 1:06:17.451
All we need is a new home.

1:06:19.453 --> 1:06:21.020
Earth....

1:06:21.064 --> 1:06:22.587
Will do nicely.

1:06:24.197 --> 1:06:25.851
Stay there, professor!

1:06:28.071 --> 1:06:29.289
Try it!

1:06:31.161 --> 1:06:35.513
Unless you want liquid
nitrogen shoved in your face.

1:06:35.556 --> 1:06:37.210
Get in there now.

1:06:42.607 --> 1:06:44.609
How'’s that for stopping
water in its tracks?

1:06:59.711 --> 1:07:02.801
Is Dr. Ryan okay?

1:07:02.844 --> 1:07:04.411
I don'’t know.

1:07:09.808 --> 1:07:12.854
I don'’t care.
I don'’t trust anyone.

1:07:15.161 --> 1:07:17.816
Cliff, you'’re losing it.

1:07:20.558 --> 1:07:22.734
Easy, Cliff. Easy.

1:07:22.777 --> 1:07:26.651
Let'’s not forget that I don't
know if you'’re okay, all right?

1:07:26.694 --> 1:07:28.740
I don'’t have time
for this, Wanda.

1:07:28.783 --> 1:07:32.135
Take the restraints
and tie yourself to the gurney.

1:07:37.792 --> 1:07:39.881
What'’s going on?

1:07:39.925 --> 1:07:41.796
Why am I tied down?

1:07:41.840 --> 1:07:45.104
Clifford is trying to
contain the situation here.

1:07:45.148 --> 1:07:46.932
Isn'’t that right, Cliff?

1:07:55.158 --> 1:07:58.596
All right,
I'’ll put the knife down.

1:07:58.639 --> 1:08:00.728
But let'’s not forget
that I haven'’t seen you

1:08:00.772 --> 1:08:03.035
heat yourself up or drink
saltwater.

1:08:03.079 --> 1:08:05.690
If you come back
looking possessed,

1:08:05.733 --> 1:08:07.953
I will snap your spine in half.

1:08:09.476 --> 1:08:11.957
I'’ll be back
shortly with the results.

1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:14.960
Sophie'’s up too, and her blood
work should be finished.

1:08:16.701 --> 1:08:19.356
Give it up, Smith.

1:08:19.399 --> 1:08:22.794
Let us out and all
your pain goes away.

1:08:22.837 --> 1:08:24.926
Request denied, Colonel.

1:08:24.970 --> 1:08:28.800
And with all due respect,
I eat pain just for the taste.

1:08:34.762 --> 1:08:36.895
How are we doing in there?

1:08:36.938 --> 1:08:40.159
If you'’re trying to give
me a heat stroke, it'’s working.

1:08:40.203 --> 1:08:41.813
Want some bottled water?

1:08:41.856 --> 1:08:44.903
-Yes, please.
-Back away from the door.

1:09:00.397 --> 1:09:02.877
What'’s in the water?

1:09:04.705 --> 1:09:05.967
[vomiting]

1:09:11.059 --> 1:09:13.279
Just some simple
water with a little sodium.

1:09:13.323 --> 1:09:15.542
Salt tablets, to be exact.

1:09:18.241 --> 1:09:20.852
[rumbling]

1:09:26.031 --> 1:09:27.815
Great, looks like
I pissed it off again.

1:09:37.434 --> 1:09:39.784
Now it'’s time to
check the control group.

1:09:39.827 --> 1:09:43.657
That'’s you. We gotta go.
Come on. Let'’s go.

1:09:43.701 --> 1:09:45.181
Hurry.

1:09:45.224 --> 1:09:48.619
Arcturus crew, wormhole closes
in 15 minutes.

1:09:48.662 --> 1:09:51.361
Tell me you'’ve cured this.

1:09:51.404 --> 1:09:55.321
I hear you, Commander.
Don'’t leave.

1:09:55.365 --> 1:09:56.888
We'’ve got this.

1:09:56.931 --> 1:09:59.412
You see that?
Your vitals on the left.

1:09:59.456 --> 1:10:02.023
Normal heart rate,
normal body temperature.

1:10:02.067 --> 1:10:05.026
Jennifer is on the right.

1:10:05.070 --> 1:10:09.422
65 degrees and her heart rate is
less than 30 beats per minute.

1:10:12.817 --> 1:10:14.384
Your blood work is
clear of any infection.

1:10:14.427 --> 1:10:16.081
No unusual pathogens.

1:10:16.124 --> 1:10:18.170
And your white blood
cell count seems to be normal.

1:10:18.214 --> 1:10:20.303
-So I'’m not infected?
-Yes.

1:10:20.346 --> 1:10:23.088
With these results and
the IV fluids, I can confirm.

1:10:23.131 --> 1:10:26.526
And what would have happened
if I was still infected?

1:10:26.570 --> 1:10:28.398
Your bloodstream would have
been full of those

1:10:28.441 --> 1:10:29.921
membrane structures
that control the water.

1:10:29.964 --> 1:10:31.357
Giving you the sodium fluids

1:10:31.401 --> 1:10:32.576
would have killed you
like it killed Kyle.

1:10:37.320 --> 1:10:39.322
Your turn, Jen.
This is crazy.

1:10:39.365 --> 1:10:41.628
I'’m not infected.

1:10:41.672 --> 1:10:43.021
I love you, Jen.

1:10:44.718 --> 1:10:46.807
With all my heart.

1:10:46.851 --> 1:10:49.157
-I don'’t have a choice.
-Okay, Cliff. I'’ll do it.

1:10:51.377 --> 1:10:54.250
But kiss me first.
Just in case it'’s our last.

1:11:01.039 --> 1:11:02.562
It'’s wrapped itself
around the ship.

1:11:02.606 --> 1:11:04.129
The hull is starting to buckle.

1:11:04.172 --> 1:11:05.173
Look there!

1:11:08.873 --> 1:11:10.657
Keep working!

1:11:10.701 --> 1:11:12.050
She'’s about to
throw it all up.

1:11:14.444 --> 1:11:15.836
Do it, now!

1:11:23.496 --> 1:11:24.497
[gasping]

1:11:27.587 --> 1:11:29.328
You got two choices.

1:11:29.372 --> 1:11:32.723
Exit those men willingly
and I let you and your buddies

1:11:32.766 --> 1:11:35.247
in this bag off
this ship unharmed.

1:11:36.944 --> 1:11:39.425
Or... I burn it.

1:11:41.122 --> 1:11:42.950
And I inject those
two with sodium fluids,

1:11:42.994 --> 1:11:44.561
killing all of you.

1:11:46.084 --> 1:11:49.087
Live or die.
Decide now.

1:11:52.220 --> 1:11:53.744
[groaning]

1:12:06.191 --> 1:12:07.671
T-minus five minutes and
counting

1:12:07.714 --> 1:12:10.108
until we head back
into the wormhole.

1:12:10.151 --> 1:12:13.285
All systems nominal.
Power at 80%.

1:12:13.329 --> 1:12:15.505
Commander Lewis,
this is Colonel Bradley.

1:12:15.548 --> 1:12:17.681
The Ryans were able to cleanse
the ship and cure the infected,

1:12:17.724 --> 1:12:18.682
including myself.

1:12:18.725 --> 1:12:20.205
-How?
-Salt?

1:12:20.248 --> 1:12:22.512
These parasites can
only live in freshwater.

1:12:22.555 --> 1:12:24.949
We have test and control group.
We have comparative blood work.

1:12:24.992 --> 1:12:27.168
Cliff is uploading
the vitals report to you now.

1:12:27.212 --> 1:12:29.040
We are getting out of here.

1:12:29.083 --> 1:12:31.608
Engage all swivels
and allow them to dock.

1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:34.393
Tell everyone
to brace themselves,

1:12:34.437 --> 1:12:36.656
this is not going
to be a smooth ride.

1:12:36.700 --> 1:12:38.310
Take a seat and hold on.

1:12:49.582 --> 1:12:53.325
Arcturus medical shuttle
reengaging with Luna-One.

1:12:54.587 --> 1:12:57.416
The entire moon
is breaking apart.

1:13:04.075 --> 1:13:07.252
The entire organism
broke free from the moon.

1:13:07.295 --> 1:13:08.340
It'’s coming for us!

1:13:08.384 --> 1:13:09.341
No, no, no.

1:13:09.385 --> 1:13:10.821
If it takes over this ship,

1:13:10.864 --> 1:13:11.952
it'’s gonna pilot us
through the wormhole

1:13:11.996 --> 1:13:12.953
back to earth!

1:13:12.997 --> 1:13:15.652
Brace yourselves!

1:13:15.695 --> 1:13:18.959
Commander, go!
Get us out of here.

1:13:19.003 --> 1:13:20.787
One minute to the wormhole!

1:13:20.831 --> 1:13:22.528
Maximum thrusters!

1:13:22.572 --> 1:13:25.444
It'’s no good.
The organism is almost on us.

1:13:25.488 --> 1:13:27.185
Activate the
sodium ion thrusters!

1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:31.624
Sodium ion thrusters...

1:13:31.668 --> 1:13:33.409
Turn off the engine!

1:13:33.452 --> 1:13:34.714
Jen, are you insane?

1:13:34.758 --> 1:13:36.847
Look at me, are you still
infected?

1:13:36.890 --> 1:13:40.720
If it'’s a sodium ion engine
that requires a saline reactant!

1:13:40.764 --> 1:13:43.549
Saline kills the organism!

1:13:43.593 --> 1:13:45.508
Turn off all engines!

1:13:45.551 --> 1:13:48.380
Dump all the
fuels then reignite.

1:13:51.078 --> 1:13:53.864
Luna-One, dumping fuel reserve.

1:13:53.907 --> 1:13:56.736
Unidentified amoeboid-like
entity is solidifying.

1:13:56.780 --> 1:13:58.477
We dumped the fuel
and froze the organism.

1:13:58.521 --> 1:14:00.044
Ignition. Ignition.

1:14:00.087 --> 1:14:01.480
Ignition.

1:14:01.524 --> 1:14:03.221
How much power now?
How much power now?

1:14:03.264 --> 1:14:05.397
88%. We are ready
for the wormhole.

1:14:05.441 --> 1:14:07.225
Go!

1:14:07.268 --> 1:14:09.967
Brace yourselves.
We are now entering wormhole.

1:14:25.461 --> 1:14:27.680
Luna-One now exiting wormhole.

1:14:31.945 --> 1:14:33.599
Looks like we made it, doctor.

1:14:33.643 --> 1:14:36.907
Worse for the wear,
but we made it.

1:14:43.957 --> 1:14:46.264
Commander, an unidentified
organism has

1:14:46.307 --> 1:14:47.657
infiltrated
the ship'’s mainframe

1:14:47.700 --> 1:14:49.093
and all control systems.

1:14:58.972 --> 1:15:01.540
Commander Lewis,
they'’ve identified a mass

1:15:01.584 --> 1:15:03.281
traveling with your ship.

1:15:03.324 --> 1:15:05.805
The DoD has already launched
a nuke into the wormhole.

1:15:05.849 --> 1:15:07.633
I am sorry Commander,
but you'’re not going to

1:15:07.677 --> 1:15:08.634
make it through.

1:15:08.678 --> 1:15:10.157
Just launched a nuke at us!

1:15:10.201 --> 1:15:12.203
They just launched
a nuke into the wormhole!

1:15:12.246 --> 1:15:15.162
-Why would they do that?
-The creature is on board.

1:15:15.206 --> 1:15:16.816
Can'’t let it get to earth.

1:15:16.860 --> 1:15:18.644
We'’re gonna die?

1:15:18.688 --> 1:15:21.386
-Who'’s steering the ship?
-It'’s probably the water.

1:15:29.568 --> 1:15:31.831
It isn'’t going to
end like this.

1:15:31.875 --> 1:15:35.052
Frank, is there any way
to take back control of

1:15:35.095 --> 1:15:37.750
the guidance system to
outmaneuver the nuclear missile?

1:15:37.794 --> 1:15:39.360
The missile is heat-seeking.

1:15:39.404 --> 1:15:40.753
Our thermal footprint is--

1:15:40.797 --> 1:15:42.363
Does it have control over
the ignition?

1:15:42.407 --> 1:15:46.280
Kill everything on the exterior.
Max out the engines.

1:15:46.324 --> 1:15:47.891
What? Maxing out the engines
is gonna exceed

1:15:47.934 --> 1:15:50.371
over 10,000 degrees.

1:15:50.415 --> 1:15:53.287
No, no no.
We'’re already at 9000.

1:15:53.331 --> 1:15:55.551
Ships like this
explode at 10,000.

1:15:55.594 --> 1:15:59.206
Greg, the temp regulator.

1:15:59.250 --> 1:16:01.165
Operate it manually.

1:16:01.208 --> 1:16:02.645
You spent years
studying this ship.

1:16:02.688 --> 1:16:03.733
Only you can do it.

1:16:03.776 --> 1:16:05.517
Jen, it'’s going to kill him!

1:16:05.561 --> 1:16:07.432
If he dives the temp,
it'’s going to shed ionized air--

1:16:07.475 --> 1:16:10.827
If I die, I die.
It'’s alright, Cliff.

1:16:10.870 --> 1:16:13.873
Desperate times,
desperate measures.

1:16:13.917 --> 1:16:16.093
Somebody'’s gotta take the risk.

1:16:16.136 --> 1:16:17.616
I got this.
I got this.

1:16:19.444 --> 1:16:24.841
Frank, max the engines.
Burn the alien off the exterior.

1:16:26.843 --> 1:16:29.454
Firing jet flame torches.

1:16:35.503 --> 1:16:38.071
The ship'’s breaking!

1:16:38.115 --> 1:16:40.596
Can'’t add any more.
stress to the ship, Jennifer.

1:16:40.639 --> 1:16:42.336
Frank.

1:16:42.380 --> 1:16:44.600
The majority of the creature
has been evaporated,

1:16:44.643 --> 1:16:46.558
-but some of it remains.
-Where'’s the nuke?

1:16:46.602 --> 1:16:48.908
T-minus four minutes,
16 seconds.

1:16:48.952 --> 1:16:50.823
Jen, The rest of the creature
is still on board the ship.

1:16:50.867 --> 1:16:52.216
We'’re gonna get whatever

1:16:52.259 --> 1:16:53.913
is wrapped around
the guidance system.

1:16:53.957 --> 1:16:56.176
Grab that flamethrower.
Let'’s get to the engine room.

1:16:59.527 --> 1:17:00.485
Greg?

1:17:03.357 --> 1:17:05.446
That already occurred to me.

1:17:05.490 --> 1:17:07.623
Jen, Cliff was right.

1:17:07.666 --> 1:17:10.234
The engine doesn'’t
wind down after its max.

1:17:10.277 --> 1:17:13.759
It'’s holding at 9900 degrees.

1:17:13.803 --> 1:17:15.587
Gonna have to strong-arm it.

1:17:15.631 --> 1:17:18.416
You stay back there too long,
the radiation will kill you.

1:17:18.459 --> 1:17:20.679
Guidance system runs along
the column of wires

1:17:20.723 --> 1:17:23.247
connected to a series of
servo motors

1:17:23.290 --> 1:17:25.902
that engage the main runners.

1:17:25.945 --> 1:17:27.643
There'’s an alarm trigger

1:17:27.686 --> 1:17:31.603
along server 16 Charlie
through 19 Echo.

1:17:32.735 --> 1:17:34.127
It knows we'’re coming!

1:17:34.171 --> 1:17:35.781
It can hear us!

1:17:45.748 --> 1:17:47.488
No!

1:17:47.532 --> 1:17:49.055
Hold on...
He'’s gone.

1:17:49.099 --> 1:17:50.666
No!

1:17:50.709 --> 1:17:52.711
He'’s gone, Dr. Ryan.

1:17:52.755 --> 1:17:54.626
Light it up.

1:17:56.759 --> 1:17:58.935
...anything that isn'’t
locked down!

1:17:58.978 --> 1:18:00.806
Randolph on my six.

1:18:03.113 --> 1:18:04.636
The steering column is free.

1:18:04.680 --> 1:18:08.292
I'’m bypassing bank 16
through 19 firewall.

1:18:08.335 --> 1:18:11.948
The stabilizer'’s locked,
but it won'’t hold.

1:18:11.991 --> 1:18:13.123
Where is it?

1:18:13.166 --> 1:18:14.733
It'’s in the manual override,

1:18:14.777 --> 1:18:17.388
it'’s trying to take
control again.

1:18:17.431 --> 1:18:20.391
Jen, the engine said 9999.

1:18:20.434 --> 1:18:23.394
I'’m trying to hold it together.

1:18:23.437 --> 1:18:26.223
I'’m doing everything I can.

1:18:26.266 --> 1:18:28.181
[shouts]

1:18:28.225 --> 1:18:29.313
Radiation burned his hands!

1:18:30.923 --> 1:18:32.925
We did it, we'’re at 8900.

1:18:32.969 --> 1:18:34.927
It was successful.

1:18:34.971 --> 1:18:36.668
What is it?

1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:43.196
It'’s travelling
through the air vents.

1:18:43.240 --> 1:18:44.502
Up to the cockpit.

1:18:44.545 --> 1:18:47.244
Frank, shut
all interior campers.

1:18:47.287 --> 1:18:48.811
Lock it inside.

1:18:48.854 --> 1:18:50.769
I only have
enough reserves to prep

1:18:50.813 --> 1:18:53.163
evasive maneuvers for the nuke.

1:18:53.206 --> 1:18:55.165
So he needs help.

1:18:55.208 --> 1:18:56.514
I did everything I can.

1:18:56.557 --> 1:18:58.516
We'’re successfully winding down.

1:18:58.559 --> 1:19:00.083
-Get them to the cockpit.
-Roger that.

1:19:13.400 --> 1:19:14.358
Watch out!

1:19:16.752 --> 1:19:18.797
Seal the vents!

1:19:21.887 --> 1:19:24.585
How far off is the nuke?

1:19:24.629 --> 1:19:28.415
1 minute, 32 seconds.
Banking. 33%.

1:19:40.558 --> 1:19:42.429
Wanda, get out of here!

1:19:45.258 --> 1:19:46.694
No, no more.
Give me that.

1:19:47.783 --> 1:19:49.654
Frank, max out the engines now.

1:19:51.874 --> 1:19:53.266
Commander?
49 seconds to impact.

1:19:53.310 --> 1:19:54.528
Sorry, I underestimated you,
Cliff,

1:19:54.572 --> 1:19:57.488
but this guy
here underestimated me.

1:19:57.531 --> 1:19:59.969
Hank, what are you doing?

1:20:00.012 --> 1:20:03.320
That'’s right.
Jen, Cliff, Jen.

1:20:03.363 --> 1:20:05.278
Shoot the nitrous reserve!

1:20:09.282 --> 1:20:11.284
Evac to Arcturus and detach!

1:20:11.328 --> 1:20:13.330
Frank, bank us to the wall.

1:20:13.373 --> 1:20:15.549
We did it.
It'’s entirely frozen!

1:20:15.593 --> 1:20:17.247
Evac to Arcturus!

1:20:21.904 --> 1:20:24.863
Nuclear impact in seven, six...

1:20:24.907 --> 1:20:27.300
Go for launch!

1:20:37.049 --> 1:20:39.312
The ship'’s gonna tear apart!

1:20:39.356 --> 1:20:40.574
Retrograde thrust!

1:20:40.618 --> 1:20:43.577
-Down to 60%!
-Take it down 20.

1:20:43.621 --> 1:20:46.972
A little more...

1:20:55.502 --> 1:20:56.895
I'’m sorry.

1:20:56.939 --> 1:20:58.592
I'’m sorry, guys.

1:20:58.636 --> 1:21:00.464
Thank God you'’re with us.

1:21:00.507 --> 1:21:03.293
We got you.

1:21:03.336 --> 1:21:06.339
Any sign of the parasite?

1:21:06.383 --> 1:21:09.125
No organic matter is detected
on the ship'’s hull.

1:21:10.213 --> 1:21:11.692
Where are we now?

1:21:13.303 --> 1:21:15.392
You'’re over the Middle East.

1:21:20.484 --> 1:21:22.747
Setting autopilot now.

1:21:22.790 --> 1:21:26.533
The coordinates are
31.559 to zero degrees north,

1:21:26.577 --> 1:21:31.277
35.473, two degrees east.

1:21:31.321 --> 1:21:33.758
Hey, where'’s that?

1:21:33.801 --> 1:21:36.326
That better be somewhere safe.

1:21:36.369 --> 1:21:38.023
I think I know
where you'’re headed.

1:21:49.905 --> 1:21:50.862
[laughing]

1:21:50.906 --> 1:21:53.125
We'’ve landed.

1:21:53.169 --> 1:21:55.258
Safe and sound.

1:21:57.608 --> 1:21:59.958
Oh, okay.

1:22:07.531 --> 1:22:09.402
We'’re in water.
We'’re in water.

1:22:09.446 --> 1:22:12.405
What if any of it
survived reentry. Huh?

1:22:12.449 --> 1:22:14.625
Between Jordan and Israel.

1:22:16.322 --> 1:22:18.107
We'’re in the Dead Sea,
to be exact.

1:22:20.631 --> 1:22:21.806
One of the saltiest
lakes in the world.

1:22:23.329 --> 1:22:24.896
Eight times saltier
than average seawater.

1:22:24.940 --> 1:22:29.118
So if any of those
parasites did make it through,

1:22:29.161 --> 1:22:31.033
they are done now.

1:22:31.076 --> 1:22:32.556
Well then, thank you.

1:22:32.599 --> 1:22:34.601
Thank you.

1:22:40.694 --> 1:22:41.957
-Thank you.
-We made it.

1:22:45.221 --> 1:22:46.526
Sophie.

1:22:53.925 --> 1:22:55.100
Amen.

1:23:00.540 --> 1:23:02.629
Hey, keep your
mouths closed.

1:23:04.109 --> 1:23:06.677
Kiss like that...
Where are your masks?
