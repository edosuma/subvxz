00:06.005 --> 00:07.966
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:26.067 --> 00:27.277
[Manito] I'm alive.

00:31.489 --> 00:34.325
Now you can pursue
your modeling career at ease.

00:38.246 --> 00:40.707
And the morgue? The ring?

00:44.961 --> 00:47.338
[Manito] Here, Ismael.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.174
It's useless to me now.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.233
I need everybody at work.

01:07.317 --> 01:10.487
Here, resting, sleeping, I don't care.
Bring everyone.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.238
You know how important this job is?

01:15.950 --> 01:17.660
What are you doing here? Let's go.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.039
No.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.834
-I'm safe with Ollanta.
-Safe?

01:26.419 --> 01:30.715
-Ollanta will fuck you over.
-Not everyone is a shitbag like you.

01:31.883 --> 01:33.176
I risked my life...

01:34.844 --> 01:36.554
and you were already hidden here.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.724
I saw the pictures, Teo.

01:40.308 --> 01:42.435
Your face is plastered
all over the city...

01:44.020 --> 01:45.563
wearing Edha.

01:48.691 --> 01:50.110
The company that killed me.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.536
I got in there for you,
to find who's responsible.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.497
You got with Celia for me too?

02:03.623 --> 02:04.999
[Teo] We're no longer together.

02:09.462 --> 02:11.464
I shouldn't have been
in the factory that night.

02:11.548 --> 02:12.549
[Ollanta]  Hey!

02:14.509 --> 02:15.969
Is he leaving or staying?

02:18.638 --> 02:19.639
He's leaving.

02:22.684 --> 02:23.935
[Manito] Who sent you here?

02:24.644 --> 02:26.479
That son of a bitch, Mota, right?

02:27.564 --> 02:29.399
He's after Ollanta.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.987
What happened that night in the factory?

02:36.781 --> 02:38.992
Please, Manito, think who else was there.

02:39.075 --> 02:40.410
Ismael...

02:41.536 --> 02:42.745
Aníbal...

02:44.205 --> 02:45.915
There was always something to do.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.293
They brought in fabrics.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.630
They pressured us
to finish everything quickly.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.048
Look at me.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.718
It was sabotage.

02:58.595 --> 03:01.472
But it's important you come out
and tell what you saw.

03:01.556 --> 03:02.765
Do you understand?

03:02.849 --> 03:05.560
If I go out, they're going to blame me.

03:06.477 --> 03:10.899
You're the one who has to understand,
the only way for me to live...

03:11.816 --> 03:13.610
is being dead.

03:26.789 --> 03:29.918
But you remember? The night
my mother Inés died, you testified.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.045
Very little. It was many years ago.

03:32.962 --> 03:35.632
-I was in the police station...
-And the precinct?

03:35.715 --> 03:36.925
You went there with Lorenzo.

03:37.342 --> 03:40.136
No... I don't think so.
He wasn't around, was he?

03:42.013 --> 03:43.932
-You remember that?
-What?

03:44.015 --> 03:46.267
If Lorenzo was in Buenos Aires or not.

03:46.351 --> 03:49.229
-No, I don't know.
-Marita, you lived at home.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.814
-As a live-in maid.
-I don't remember everything.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.651
Not everything.
I'm talking about the night Inés died.

03:55.109 --> 03:57.362
-You don't remember?
-I told you, no.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.325
You're talking about things
that happened--

04:02.408 --> 04:03.701
They're not "things."

04:04.369 --> 04:06.329
It's the night Inés died.

04:07.288 --> 04:08.414
You're lying to me.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.416
I don't lie.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.003
I think I saw you.

04:20.802 --> 04:24.555
[gasps]

04:25.974 --> 04:27.267
I saw you that night.

04:29.018 --> 04:30.186
I remember you vividly.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.190
Look... I'm sorry.

04:35.024 --> 04:36.192
I can't talk anymore.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.452
[door opens]

04:50.248 --> 04:52.083
[door closes]

05:11.686 --> 05:14.480
[Lorenzo]  Very well, darling.
You're getting better.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.735
Soon, you'll be able to sign in my place.

05:42.175 --> 05:45.136
[Lorenzo] Can we talk outside, please?
I'll be right back, darling.

05:50.933 --> 05:54.270
-[Lorenzo] Why did you bring the child?
-[Marita] I want him to know his family.

05:54.353 --> 05:57.356
[Lorenzo] You're his family. With what
I give you, he has family forever.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.650
-[Marita] It's not enough.
-[Lorenzo] How much do you want?

06:00.318 --> 06:02.487
[Marita] I'm not asking you that.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.655
I want him to have
the life he deserves.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.783
To enjoy his father, his family.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.327
I want him to be part of the family.

06:11.162 --> 06:14.832
[Lorenzo]  I want to make it clear
that your son will never be an Abadi.

06:16.667 --> 06:21.047
-[Lorenzo]  Take the boy out of here.
-[Marita]  Don't be so sure, Lorenzo.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.144
-We're siblings.
-Why did you come?

06:35.645 --> 06:36.729
To know.

06:37.271 --> 06:38.898
Well. Now you know.

06:39.690 --> 06:40.817
What will you do?

06:42.568 --> 06:44.112
Why didn't you tell me?

06:44.529 --> 06:45.530
For what?

06:46.239 --> 06:48.241
You always looked down on me.

06:50.159 --> 06:53.121
I was never here. I never came.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.457
Let things stay the same.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.628
You've suffered enough already.
Both of you have.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.927
[door closes]

07:08.010 --> 07:09.846
-We have to tell your father, now.
-No.

07:09.929 --> 07:13.599
-Aníbal...
-It concerns them, not this family.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.018
Let her see Lorenzo continue lying.

07:32.910 --> 07:34.787
What happened? What did he tell you?

07:35.705 --> 07:36.873
Ollanta didn't do it.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.710
-Who confirmed it?
-My brother.

07:42.628 --> 07:43.796
He's alive.

07:45.673 --> 07:47.967
He's with Ollanta, who is protecting him.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.929
-He was hiding in there.
-Does he know who did it?

07:52.013 --> 07:54.056
Who burned down the sweatshop?

07:54.140 --> 07:55.725
He didn't say much. Not to me.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.811
-He must have seen someone.
-He mentioned Antonio, Aníbal...

07:58.895 --> 08:00.897
Everyone went through that factory.

08:01.731 --> 08:02.940
Aníbal...

08:04.108 --> 08:05.234
Aníbal, yes.

08:05.818 --> 08:06.944
Did something happen?

08:13.242 --> 08:14.368
He's my brother.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.914
Lorenzo knew all along
and didn't say anything.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.708
He hates him... He hates us.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.127
Aníbal...

08:26.923 --> 08:29.717
[sewing machines whir]

08:34.514 --> 08:36.182
Stop goofing off, David!

08:36.265 --> 08:38.893
Assert your place and
the responsibility assigned to you.

08:38.976 --> 08:40.853
My responsibility is to do my best.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.523
Not here. You have to do
as we've always done.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.860
That... guy is waiting for you downstairs.

08:50.279 --> 08:52.323
[Ronnie]  I saved you the trip.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.451
I can't see your things
without you anymore.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.746
Go away, Ronnie, for your own sake.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.623
Are they so dangerous?

09:01.624 --> 09:02.750
Did you tell them everything?

09:03.793 --> 09:04.961
They're my family.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.129
There are no secrets between us.

09:07.797 --> 09:08.923
Are you sure?

09:10.675 --> 09:11.842
It's over, Ronnie.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.303
It's over for you, Antonio.

09:15.137 --> 09:16.556
For me, it's just beginning.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.644
Come in, Esther. Ronnie's leaving now.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.346
Yes, what is it?

09:57.430 --> 09:58.973
[Teo]  My brother survived the fire.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.225
He's alive and in hiding.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.644
He gave me several names.
Among them, Aníbal's.

10:03.728 --> 10:06.814
Manito saw Aníbal at the factory
the night of the fire.

10:06.897 --> 10:08.566
What do I do with that?

10:09.108 --> 10:10.401
Aníbal is Lorenzo's son.

10:11.068 --> 10:12.194
Excuse me?

10:12.278 --> 10:14.530
He's Marita Gomez's son,
one of Lorenzo's mistresses.

10:15.948 --> 10:19.493
I know who Marita Gomez is.
She's in Inés Musccini's case file.

10:19.577 --> 10:22.079
What evidence is there on this kid Aníbal?

10:22.163 --> 10:25.207
You'll have time to find out.
My brother won't. I want him free...

10:25.625 --> 10:28.294
and the people responsible
for the fire in prison.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.838
Get your brother
to testify against Aníbal.

10:30.921 --> 10:34.008
I'll get him in witness protection,
he can start a new life.

10:35.092 --> 10:38.095
I have to convince him.
He doesn't want to testify.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.307
You have 24 hours to convince him,
then I'll go after Edha.

10:41.390 --> 10:44.477
I won't be able to do much for him.
OK? Goodbye.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.024
[footsteps]

10:52.276 --> 10:53.444
So?

10:55.738 --> 10:58.324
[cellphone rings]

10:58.407 --> 11:00.368
[cellphone rings, Edha sighs]

11:00.451 --> 11:03.537
It's no good. We have to tell
the tailor it's not working.

11:03.621 --> 11:07.333
I chose that fabric because it adapts
to Teo's body, not anyone else's.

11:08.709 --> 11:12.880
I need the cut to respect the lines,
with their defects and virtues.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.257
Am I not making myself clear?

11:15.758 --> 11:19.178
It's the third time we remake
this garment, we're behind schedule--

11:19.261 --> 11:22.014
I know, Florencia, I set those deadlines.
Don't push me.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.475
Without Antonio,
it's hard to finish the production.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.606
-[Elena] Hi, Mom.
-Hello, love.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.359
Nice to see you.

11:33.859 --> 11:36.570
Though it's sad that it's just
because you forgot something.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.781
Don't be so dramatic.
We can get together later.

11:38.864 --> 11:41.617
[Edha] OK... Monina!

11:42.493 --> 11:46.080
Sorry I didn't pick up, I saw your call,
but I had a very complicated day.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.290
-See you later, OK?
-[Monina] Stay, Elena.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.210
You have to stay.

11:56.924 --> 11:58.050
[Edha]  Are you OK?

11:58.717 --> 12:00.052
Have you been drinking?

12:01.429 --> 12:02.638
Yes, just a little.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.933
-Leave us.
-No.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.395
She has to be here.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.607
[Monina sighs heavily]

12:15.568 --> 12:18.571
Wanting to see one thing,
you see another.

12:20.698 --> 12:21.907
That.

12:22.324 --> 12:23.993
I'm not here to inconvenience you.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.162
But...

12:26.662 --> 12:28.247
I did come to tell you that...

12:28.998 --> 12:31.417
Elena and Julián are in a relationship.

12:35.129 --> 12:36.464
A romantic one.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.092
-[Elena] What are you saying?
-It's true, Elena.

12:40.176 --> 12:41.844
Where did you get that idea?

12:42.261 --> 12:44.805
I saw you kiss in Julián's car.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.725
That's not true, Mom! You can't believe--

12:47.808 --> 12:52.271
Please, Elena! It's not an accusation.
Your mom has to know.

12:55.065 --> 12:56.734
[Elena gasps]

13:07.036 --> 13:09.079
You went on vacation together.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.085
-You've known her since she was little.
-Yes, it's awful.

13:16.170 --> 13:18.339
All those nights
she spent at your house...

13:21.133 --> 13:22.218
Elena is a minor.

13:23.219 --> 13:26.055
-Forgive me.
-This happened under your nose?

13:26.138 --> 13:27.806
-I didn't imagine--
-Get out!

13:28.224 --> 13:30.100
-No...
-Get out of my house!

14:05.177 --> 14:06.470
Is that necessary?

14:06.554 --> 14:08.597
[in Italian]
Sorry, I don't speak your language.

14:09.348 --> 14:12.393
-What are you saying?
-See? That's why it's necessary.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.186
So we're not treated as ignorant fools.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.480
We're going to the fashion capital, Milan.

14:17.106 --> 14:20.317
These things happen once in a lifetime,
and to some people they never happen.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.736
We are ignorant. That's why we're going.

14:23.070 --> 14:26.031
Seeing poor people wearing fancy clothes
turns them on.

14:26.490 --> 14:28.534
They only care about my butt.

14:28.617 --> 14:30.786
No... your tits, too.

14:31.662 --> 14:34.456
But if you say a few words,
you could get something better.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.501
-I don't need anything more.
-You don't know what you need.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.086
[Celia laughs]

14:42.882 --> 14:44.842
Hey, hey! What are you doing here?

14:48.304 --> 14:50.347
Wait, come here, Pija. Come in.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.641
Let me tell you.

14:55.185 --> 14:56.437
[Yastin] Give me the tickets.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.818
You're not welcome in the neighborhood.

15:03.485 --> 15:04.820
Are you living here?

15:05.863 --> 15:07.072
No, I came to visit.

15:07.489 --> 15:09.366
I rented a nice flat.

15:09.450 --> 15:13.495
I have three maids, one washes my clothes,
one cooks, and the third wipes my ass.

15:14.204 --> 15:15.372
You?

15:17.207 --> 15:19.877
-What are you up to?
-You're a pain in the ass!

15:20.461 --> 15:21.879
Are you here to control me?

15:24.548 --> 15:25.883
Manito is alive.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.726
We identified the body.

15:35.809 --> 15:36.810
It wasn't him.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.272
-The ring?
-I don't know, he took it off.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.858
-You're lying.
-No, I saw him.

15:42.942 --> 15:46.111
-Where is he? I want to see him.
-He's hiding with Ollanta.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.739
He's still mad. We didn't speak much.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.741
He's not the only one.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.868
-Forget about me, Celia.
-I forgot already.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.788
I came because of Manito.
It's important that he talks.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.749
-He's the only witness.
-Who will believe him?

15:58.832 --> 16:02.086
Didn't you see what the journalists
are saying? The neighbors?

16:02.169 --> 16:04.213
The things they did to us?

16:04.880 --> 16:06.840
To them,
Manito is the only one responsible.

16:07.591 --> 16:10.636
I talked to the DA.
If Manito testifies, he's free.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.805
A new life, new identity.

16:13.514 --> 16:14.640
What do you want?

16:16.225 --> 16:17.518
For you to convince him.

16:18.602 --> 16:21.605
-Now you need me?
-He needs us.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.697
-It wasn't--
-I want the truth.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.658
-I don't know what she saw! She's crazy!
-Elena!

16:34.201 --> 16:35.911
It happened, but the boy was--

16:35.995 --> 16:39.873
What boy? What boy is that?
You fucked your best friend's father!

16:39.957 --> 16:41.166
You're one to talk!

16:44.837 --> 16:46.547
All since Jáuregui showed up.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.090
What the fuck did you do?

16:49.925 --> 16:51.760
Do you know why you do things?

16:52.553 --> 16:54.221
I'm not having a good time either.

16:55.806 --> 16:59.018
-Yes, it happened, but it's over.
-It shouldn't have even begun.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.353
I can't do anything about that.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.231
You're a danger to yourself.

17:04.314 --> 17:07.151
The vacation with Jáuregui is over,
you're staying here.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.166
I spoke with the Senate, we're good.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.209
-Giacceti?
-Giacceti is in.

17:24.293 --> 17:27.546
[Jáuregui]  Good. And Díaz Curto? Eh?

17:27.629 --> 17:29.173
The one from Mendoza?

17:29.256 --> 17:30.674
No, the one from Tucumán.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.093
-You mean Delbene?
-Delbene, Delbene.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.429
-He's not taking our calls.
-If I call myself?

17:35.512 --> 17:37.139
-Maybe he'll...
-Yeah.

17:53.113 --> 17:54.656
-Now what?
-Elena.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.660
She had, or has, a relationship
with Julián, Delfina's dad.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.788
-Has or had?
-Had, I think.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.583
-I don't understand.
-Monina came to tell me...

18:04.666 --> 18:06.585
that she saw them kissing.

18:06.668 --> 18:08.462
-Where?
-I don't know where!

18:08.545 --> 18:10.547
-What does Elena say?
-She denied at first.

18:11.006 --> 18:12.508
What do you mean, "at first"?

18:12.591 --> 18:15.886
Because Monina was at home,
and Elena was there.

18:16.470 --> 18:19.014
-When did she stop denying it?
-When we were alone.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.100
What did she say?

18:21.892 --> 18:25.020
How is that important? I'm telling you
that Elena, your daughter...

18:25.104 --> 18:27.940
-had an affair with a guy your age!
-Don't shout.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.817
Does Elena admit it or not?

18:30.818 --> 18:33.362
Are you listening?
This is serious, you're not listening.

18:33.445 --> 18:34.655
Don't make a scene.

18:34.738 --> 18:38.117
Until everything is clear on Elena's part,
we're not filing a complaint.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.494
I want my daughter home,
I'm not waiving that right!

18:40.577 --> 18:42.329
You came to talk about rights?

18:42.412 --> 18:45.499
They're all experts on family rights.
Do you want to ask them?

18:45.582 --> 18:49.294
The press is going to love that you
got me pregnant while I was a minor.

18:50.337 --> 18:53.924
Plus, you refused to acknowledge
the child that today you love so much.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.096
You see reality through the Edha brand.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.349
Not everything is a marketing issue.

19:02.724 --> 19:05.227
You want to rise to fame
at your daughter's expense?

19:05.310 --> 19:07.604
Awful. Don't count on me for that.

19:08.313 --> 19:11.275
I will not let your daughter
become the face of abuse,

19:11.358 --> 19:15.237
because her mother, a raving lunatic,
tries to push me around without evidence.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.906
You're not stopping me now.
There are many things to clarify.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.576
-Let go!
-I'll ruin you, Edha.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.286
And you'll never recover.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.454
Don't bother me,
and leave your daughter alone.

19:53.108 --> 19:55.068

[Manito sighs]

20:58.715 --> 21:01.176
[Celia sighs]

21:03.512 --> 21:05.347
You have to testify against Aníbal.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.683
[Celia] It's the only way out.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.061
Besides, he's Lorenzo's son, he hates him.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.356
He kept him hidden for years.

21:16.483 --> 21:19.111
He's a poor victim of that son of a bitch.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.949
But he's also guilty of killing
many people to get revenge against him.

21:26.410 --> 21:27.703
I'm scared of going out.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.080
Outside everyone hates me.

21:31.206 --> 21:33.292
The factory was my responsibility, Celia.

21:37.796 --> 21:38.839
It's not your fault.

21:40.757 --> 21:42.175
-Yes.
-No.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.054
Teo spoke with the DA.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.557
If you testify...

21:49.141 --> 21:51.059
they'll give you a new identity...

21:51.810 --> 21:53.353
and we start over.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.315
I was wrong about you.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.154
I realized when you weren't there anymore.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.038
[Celia sighs]

22:21.673 --> 22:22.924
How did it go?

22:27.846 --> 22:28.972
Let's go.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.985
Do you swear by God,
our homeland, and your honor

22:42.069 --> 22:45.072
to administer justice well and legally,

22:45.155 --> 22:48.533
in conformity with what is prescribed
by the National Constitution?

22:49.993 --> 22:51.328
Yes, I swear.

22:51.411 --> 22:55.332
And if it were not so, may God
and our homeland demand it of you.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.794
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.692
You didn't come. I waited for you.

23:23.193 --> 23:24.277
I couldn't.

23:24.986 --> 23:26.780
I can't tell you over the phone.

23:27.364 --> 23:30.367
This evening we have a fitting.
Don't miss it.

23:30.826 --> 23:32.869
Is Milan still on the table?

23:33.370 --> 23:35.080
If your brother testifies, it is.

BREAKING NEWS - JAUREGUI
SWORN IN AS SUPREME COURT JUDGE

24:11.324 --> 24:14.452
[door closes]

24:15.287 --> 24:18.582
[footsteps move away]

24:38.101 --> 24:39.436
Any news?

24:40.937 --> 24:42.147
No.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.441
It's cold outside.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.236
I can take you for a ride of you want.

24:49.946 --> 24:52.073
-That would be good.
-I'm joking.

24:53.241 --> 24:56.244
You can't go out. No one can see you.

24:57.412 --> 24:59.748
If someone identifies you,
you go to prison.

25:00.207 --> 25:01.875
And I'd go too for harboring you.

25:02.792 --> 25:04.211
[Ollanta sighs]

25:04.294 --> 25:05.712
I'm tired of hiding.

25:05.795 --> 25:07.714
[Ollanta laughs]

25:07.797 --> 25:09.090
What do you want to do?

25:09.799 --> 25:11.051
Eh?

25:11.134 --> 25:14.221
Testify. Tell them what I saw that night.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.183
It will all fall on you.

25:19.142 --> 25:22.312
Remember what you said to me
when you got here, asking for help.

25:22.896 --> 25:26.524
"I killed 30 people and it's my fault."
That's what you said to me.

25:28.068 --> 25:30.028
It was Aníbal, Lorenzo's son.

25:35.116 --> 25:36.451
That's what you want to testify?

25:38.078 --> 25:41.122
You know, prison is filled
with people like you and me.

25:42.165 --> 25:43.416
Not like them.

25:44.584 --> 25:47.295
-Are you OK?
-Yes, I need to sit down.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.547
-But I'm fine.
-I'll be right back.

25:51.549 --> 25:53.343
-[Doctor] This is a restricted--
-[Edha] Julián!

25:53.426 --> 25:56.388
I'll chop your dick in little pieces,
you son of a bitch!

25:56.471 --> 25:59.474
You fucked my daughter and she's a minor,
I'll ruin your career

25:59.557 --> 26:01.184
and make your life a living hell!

26:01.685 --> 26:06.398
You have an abuser in this hospital.
All the patients should know.

26:06.481 --> 26:07.941
They'll know soon enough.

26:23.623 --> 26:25.208
Antonio, you finally answered!

26:27.585 --> 26:29.254
Where shall we meet?

26:30.463 --> 26:32.132
I can't believe it, poor Elena.

26:32.799 --> 26:33.800
Yes.

26:33.883 --> 26:36.636
I can only imagine how you must be,
with all your history.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.806
-Do you know what to do?
-Yes, what I couldn't do before.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.684
What does Jáuregui say about this?

26:43.226 --> 26:44.978
He doesn't want it to come out.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.856
He only cares about his political career.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.567
-Did you see the news?
-Yes.

26:51.067 --> 26:53.069
Him in a suit and a large neckerchief.

26:55.572 --> 26:56.948
It doesn't matter what he wears.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.658
[Antonio laughs]

27:11.296 --> 27:12.714
I ordered you kosher food.

27:16.676 --> 27:18.345
I want to say I'm sorry.

27:19.304 --> 27:20.805
For Lorenzo, and for me...

27:21.806 --> 27:23.433
and for getting you into this.

27:23.850 --> 27:25.977
-For your new little brother, right?
-Yes.

27:26.644 --> 27:27.812
Poor kid...

27:28.563 --> 27:30.065
and a murderer.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.446
Come back to Edha.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.491
Not as an employee, but as a partner.

27:41.868 --> 27:44.913
I can't. Even if I wanted to,
Lorenzo is still there.

27:46.081 --> 27:49.542
-I'm going to buy him out.
-With what money?

27:50.502 --> 27:52.212
Did you sell Inés's work?

27:53.004 --> 27:56.424
Milan is our consecration.
If we get there, Lorenzo is out.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.844
And from then on, Edha is you and me.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.806
I need you.

28:08.937 --> 28:10.438
Sorry for the delay.

28:12.690 --> 28:15.944
[Durruti] Well, we're all present then.
We can continue.

28:16.945 --> 28:20.407
About the possibility
of the fire being deliberate,

28:20.490 --> 28:22.951
that entails intentional damage.
Do you agree?

28:23.034 --> 28:23.910
Mm-hmm.

28:23.993 --> 28:27.747
[Durruti] Good. It's only a hypothesis,
but following that train of thought

28:27.997 --> 28:32.544
we can say that whoever started the fire
is someone inside the company.

28:33.044 --> 28:34.838
I imagine we agree on that too.

28:34.921 --> 28:37.215
Only you consider the possibility
of deliberateness.

28:37.298 --> 28:40.260
I wish it was so,
but we all know it was an accident.

28:40.343 --> 28:44.055
-What are you getting at, Durruti?
-I mean the person who set the fire...

28:44.597 --> 28:47.767
is an insider,
with a strong motivation to do it.

28:48.351 --> 28:50.812
[Durruti] Which opens many possibilities,
of course.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.774
Did anyone speak? Did anyone
notice anything strange that day?

28:55.108 --> 28:56.818
Yes. I believe it was intentional.

28:58.319 --> 29:00.739
I have a good idea who might have done it.

29:01.531 --> 29:03.616
-Oh, yeah? Who?
-Aníbal.

29:04.784 --> 29:08.037
What are you talking about, Edha?
Aníbal is an excellent employee,

29:08.121 --> 29:09.456
very trustworthy.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.875
We should make him testify.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.836
We did it with Antonio, as well.

29:14.919 --> 29:16.963
-No, not with him.
-Why not?

29:17.046 --> 29:19.424
Because! I'd bet my life on Aníbal.

29:19.507 --> 29:21.634
-Literally.
-Yes, literally.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.386
He could testify as a witness.

29:23.470 --> 29:25.805
I said no. He didn't do it.

29:26.848 --> 29:29.434
Is there something
you want to tell us about Aníbal?

29:29.517 --> 29:32.103
Because you defend him
in such an unreserved manner.

29:32.187 --> 29:35.190
I defend him unreservedly
because I know perfectly who he is,

29:35.273 --> 29:37.650
just as you know perfectly
who Aníbal is too.

29:38.109 --> 29:41.696
We can judge him for many things, he has
his head in the clouds, he's simple,

29:41.780 --> 29:44.157
but to say he's a criminal
is taking it too far.

29:44.240 --> 29:48.328
One more thing. We understand
the DA office has a new witness.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.956
His testimony would place Aníbal
in the factory the night of the fire.

29:52.040 --> 29:55.376
-What witness?
-No way. There were no survivors.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.338
Apparently there were.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.885
[rapping]  ...set you ablaze
This is serious, not a game

30:03.968 --> 30:06.471
You know,
Here we're the ones who rap

30:06.554 --> 30:09.140
I want all the people
In the crowd to clap!

30:09.808 --> 30:14.646
We don't care about the soil or terrain,
We do what we can with what we obtain

30:14.729 --> 30:17.148
That's why we're here
With all the Candombe dancers

30:17.232 --> 30:18.942
The brawlers, the true freestylers

30:19.025 --> 30:21.402
Ask God what is his judgment

30:21.486 --> 30:24.781
I'm half Argentinian and I own
Half the continent, it's in my hands

30:24.864 --> 30:28.868
With my feet on the ground,
I walk through it all around

30:28.952 --> 30:32.747
Want it or not, we here are a pest,
That cop won't get us under arrest...

30:36.626 --> 30:38.086
I feel like shit.

30:39.504 --> 30:40.505
Yeah.

30:41.589 --> 30:42.590
Really.

30:44.717 --> 30:45.802
I believe you.

30:47.470 --> 30:49.931
Yeah, but you won't look at me.

30:51.432 --> 30:52.767
I'm just distracted.

30:55.311 --> 30:56.312
Del...

31:01.568 --> 31:02.819
Relax.

31:03.319 --> 31:04.487
Relax?

31:05.196 --> 31:07.365
Yeah, I'm not going to fight with you.

31:07.448 --> 31:09.951
I hated you, I forgave you,
I hated you again.

31:10.660 --> 31:13.413
I've been through shit
since my idiot mom told me.

31:16.291 --> 31:17.959
I know what happened with my dad.

31:20.044 --> 31:22.922
But honestly,
I'd rather not fight with you.

31:24.257 --> 31:26.509
It makes me sick.
I'd rather not think about it.

31:33.808 --> 31:35.393
What happened? What did you do?

31:38.521 --> 31:39.731
I don't know.

31:45.153 --> 31:47.196
It's all right. We'll get through this.

31:49.699 --> 31:51.326
I'm sorry too.

31:52.327 --> 31:53.620
Why?

31:55.163 --> 31:56.706
For having such a shitty dad.

32:23.274 --> 32:26.152
You know what that is?
A real piece of shit.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.279
Let me do it.

32:30.531 --> 32:32.367
Take your hands out of your pockets.

32:35.244 --> 32:36.746
Let me help you.

33:01.896 --> 33:03.272
Yes, it is indeed shit.

33:04.691 --> 33:06.025
Take everything off.

33:19.580 --> 33:20.957
I like him.

33:21.290 --> 33:24.002
-Are you staying?
-I am. You?

33:31.009 --> 33:32.010
What happened?

33:32.969 --> 33:35.847
You're out of time.
Tell me where should I send the police.

33:35.930 --> 33:39.017
To Edha's house,
or to take your brother to testify?

33:46.858 --> 33:50.486
Everybody can fuck up,
that's what I meant.

33:51.070 --> 33:52.530
Make yourself clear.

33:52.613 --> 33:55.241
That if you ever fuck up, I can fix it.

33:56.534 --> 33:59.078
I'll always stand by you,
I'll never abandon you.

33:59.662 --> 34:02.874
The day of the fire,
if you had something to do with it...

34:02.957 --> 34:05.668
-Are you crazy?
-I'm not accusing you of anything, son.

34:05.752 --> 34:08.046
-It's just an example.
-Go fuck yourself!

34:11.090 --> 34:12.508
[Marita] You never stop.

34:14.719 --> 34:18.389
Aníbal was always with you. With his
silence, his pain, he stood by you.

34:18.473 --> 34:21.851
That's why I told him that.
To help, one has to know.

34:22.185 --> 34:25.438
No! You're accusing him
of being responsible for a tragedy!

34:25.521 --> 34:27.148
It's not the same!

34:30.068 --> 34:31.944
You don't realize
how sensitive your son is.

34:32.028 --> 34:34.405
-Stay out of it.
-I'm telling it like it is.

34:37.158 --> 34:39.160
It's hard, playing second fiddle.

34:40.244 --> 34:41.746
Shut up, please.

34:42.121 --> 34:46.084
-Haven't we always stood by you?
-Of course, and you'll keep doing it.

34:46.584 --> 34:48.503
Don't be so sure.

34:49.879 --> 34:53.174
My son has always been humiliated,
mistreated, left for later...

34:54.550 --> 34:56.552
-What is this?
-Resentment.

34:57.470 --> 34:58.763
A lot of resentment.

35:01.015 --> 35:03.684
It's best if you go.
Today is not a good day.

35:07.688 --> 35:09.899
[Lorenzo sighs]

35:11.609 --> 35:12.777
I've had enough.

35:14.237 --> 35:15.613
Get out.

35:32.296 --> 35:34.549
[cellphone rings]

35:35.591 --> 35:37.593
-Hello?
- Lorenzo Abadi?

35:37.677 --> 35:41.055
-Yes, who are you?
-The guy who'll save you and your son.

35:41.556 --> 35:45.893
[Ollanta] In five minutes, I'll call back
and tell you where to go. Is that clear?

36:01.909 --> 36:03.703
[sewing machine whirs]

36:05.329 --> 36:06.956
[sewing machine whirs]

36:07.039 --> 36:11.169
-So? Did you manage to do it?
-Yes, the pattern was wrong.

36:12.128 --> 36:14.589
-Now they'll be just like the originals.
-Good.

36:15.089 --> 36:16.966
I'll make a delivery and buy dinner.

36:18.718 --> 36:21.721
-I'm not hungry.
-You have to eat something.

36:21.804 --> 36:24.640
Or when you get out of here,
they'll say I starved you.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.685
[sewing machine whirs]

36:41.866 --> 36:43.117
Why are you back?

36:45.161 --> 36:47.121
Because I'm free to do whatever I want.

36:51.083 --> 36:52.543
A witness appeared.

36:53.294 --> 36:54.795
They're going after Aníbal.

36:56.547 --> 36:57.673
It's over.

37:03.137 --> 37:04.472
And your family?

37:06.432 --> 37:07.683
You are my family.

37:09.268 --> 37:11.103
[Ronnie gasps]

37:24.659 --> 37:26.452
[Ollanta] Thank you for meeting me.

37:27.870 --> 37:30.915
I'll make it short
so you can go about your business.

37:32.375 --> 37:35.044
I have the foreman...

37:35.962 --> 37:36.963
Manuel.

37:37.546 --> 37:40.258
He's the only survivor of the tragedy.

37:40.716 --> 37:41.676
Oh, yeah?

37:41.759 --> 37:44.512
He's so eager to talk,
he's falling off his seat.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.555
If you get me.

37:47.390 --> 37:50.226
-There were no survivors.
-Yes, there were.

37:50.935 --> 37:54.188
It's this one, and I have him.
He's with me.

37:55.690 --> 37:58.025
And they're pushing him to testify.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.653
That it was a sabotage...

38:01.696 --> 38:03.572
and that your son is to blame.

38:06.867 --> 38:08.077
What do you want?

38:09.537 --> 38:10.788
To negotiate.

38:12.498 --> 38:13.833
I bring him to you...

38:14.709 --> 38:16.210
deliver him to you...

38:17.086 --> 38:19.297
and then you do whatever you want
with him.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.676
[Ollanta breathes heavily]

38:28.014 --> 38:32.226
This is so you can see
that I'm not bullshitting you.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.561
Hmm?

38:34.103 --> 38:35.730
I'm not playing games here.

38:37.398 --> 38:38.733
Two hundred thousand.

38:39.567 --> 38:40.776
Mate's rates.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.408
[Lorenzo exhales deeply]

38:48.909 --> 38:50.077
No.

38:54.373 --> 38:56.000
I'll pay you double...

38:58.836 --> 39:00.296
and don't bring him to me.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.215
Make him disappear.

39:03.799 --> 39:06.635
