WEBVTT

00:10.658 --> 00:12.224
Give us the room, guys.

00:12.226 --> 00:13.626
Thank you.

00:16.229 --> 00:17.763
Morning.

00:17.765 --> 00:19.765
Morning, sir.

00:19.767 --> 00:21.700
Morning, Commissioner.

00:21.702 --> 00:23.902
That went well.

00:23.904 --> 00:25.037
What went well?

00:25.039 --> 00:27.706
The difficult transition
from talking about me

00:27.708 --> 00:29.675
to talking about me
in front of me.

00:29.677 --> 00:32.077
We weren't talking about you.

00:35.849 --> 00:38.784
Frank, do you know
Deputy Mayor Herrera?

00:38.786 --> 00:40.452
Yeah, we worked together

00:40.454 --> 00:42.454
during the U.N.
General Assembly.

00:42.456 --> 00:46.425
Sylvia is a member
of my inner circle

00:46.427 --> 00:47.793
for the past 20 years.

00:47.795 --> 00:49.328
There's really no one
I trust more.

00:49.330 --> 00:51.163
Until now?

00:51.165 --> 00:52.564
Well, she lives with an...

00:52.566 --> 00:55.200
unpredictable guy
named Ray McClain.

00:55.202 --> 00:57.269
She loves him--
won't cut him loose.

00:57.271 --> 00:58.303
Couple of years ago,

00:58.305 --> 01:01.306
Ray was convicted
of felony assault.

01:01.308 --> 01:02.374
Now he's on parole.

01:02.376 --> 01:04.309
He screwed up, paid for it.

01:04.311 --> 01:05.744
The mistake was his, not hers.

01:05.746 --> 01:07.079
That's right.
And so far,

01:07.081 --> 01:08.313
we've been able to keep it
out of the press.

01:08.315 --> 01:10.249
So far?

01:10.251 --> 01:12.284
Well, last night
one of your officers

01:12.286 --> 01:14.620
arrested Ray
outside of a bar in Queens.

01:14.622 --> 01:16.755
One of <i>our</i> officers.

01:16.757 --> 01:18.390
That's right.

01:18.392 --> 01:20.626
Some kind of misdemeanor.

01:20.628 --> 01:23.195
Which would violate his parole.

01:23.197 --> 01:25.364
And potentially find its way
into the papers.

01:27.467 --> 01:30.269
I don't want to lose her, Frank.

01:32.372 --> 01:35.941
I can't tinker
with a legitimate arrest.

01:35.943 --> 01:37.142
You know
that, right?

01:37.144 --> 01:39.044
Of course I know that.

01:39.046 --> 01:40.979
But I would consider this
a personal favor

01:40.981 --> 01:42.281
if you would take a look.

01:42.283 --> 01:44.316
At...?

01:44.318 --> 01:45.851
Well, at the arrest,

01:45.853 --> 01:49.021
at the circumstance...

01:49.023 --> 01:51.657
At the big picture, Frank.

01:55.562 --> 01:59.031
DISPATCH: <i>12 David, 10-30</i>
<i>at 418 Green Street.</i>

01:59.033 --> 02:00.966
Suspect is a female Hispanic
wearing jeans and a blue top.

02:00.968 --> 02:02.935
(siren wailing)

02:02.937 --> 02:04.403
(siren stops)

02:04.405 --> 02:06.538
Hey, what's
going on?

02:06.540 --> 02:08.340
Civilian Patrolman
Andy Fisher, sir!

02:08.342 --> 02:09.441
How you doing?
Great.

02:09.443 --> 02:12.411
Great.
The suspect has been contained.

02:13.513 --> 02:14.646
You pull your car

02:14.648 --> 02:16.815
all the way up on the sidewalk
like that, Andy?

02:16.817 --> 02:19.251
Yes. Yeah, yeah.
I-I spotted the suspect

02:19.253 --> 02:21.019
fleeing the bodega
with a box of lottery tickets,

02:21.021 --> 02:22.187
so I...

02:22.189 --> 02:23.689
I pulled a u-ey, I cut her off

02:23.691 --> 02:24.923
and then I kept her at bay

02:24.925 --> 02:26.225
with the Old Persuader, here.

02:26.227 --> 02:27.993
That's great.

02:27.995 --> 02:29.595
But you know
Civilian Patrol volunteers

02:29.597 --> 02:31.563
aren't supposed
to pursue suspects, right?

02:33.099 --> 02:34.700
I don't... I guess I kind of got

02:34.702 --> 02:36.568
caught up in the moment, so...

02:36.570 --> 02:38.237
All right, we'll take it
from here. Come on.

02:38.239 --> 02:39.805
Okay. Copy that.
JAMIE: Yeah.

02:39.807 --> 02:41.340
10-4. (laughs)

02:42.642 --> 02:44.576
All right, Andy, let's go.
JAMIE: Come on.

02:44.578 --> 02:46.013
Okay. Okay, it was great
working with you guys.

02:46.037 --> 02:46.813
All right.

02:46.814 --> 02:48.747
I'll, uh... I'll catch you
around the precinct, okay?

02:48.749 --> 02:51.083
JAMIE: Okay.
Okay.

02:54.687 --> 02:58.090
Your client is on trial for
one count of murder for hire

02:58.092 --> 02:59.658
in the death of
Edward Harper,

02:59.660 --> 03:00.859
along with the murders

03:00.861 --> 03:02.461
of his twin
nine-year-old daughters.

03:02.463 --> 03:04.096
Good luck
proving that.

03:04.098 --> 03:05.063
I don't need luck.

03:05.065 --> 03:06.031
I have an eyewitness.

03:06.033 --> 03:08.066
Are you referring
to Thomas Conti?

03:08.068 --> 03:10.836
Who saw Mr. Dano
execute the victims

03:10.838 --> 03:12.704
outside the Casa Vista Grill.

03:12.706 --> 03:14.640
Conti is a lying sack of crap

03:14.642 --> 03:17.342
and whoever did this
should've popped him, too.

03:17.344 --> 03:19.278
ERIN:
If you plead guilty now,

03:19.280 --> 03:21.180
we are willing
to reduce the charges

03:21.182 --> 03:22.915
to three counts of
second-degree murder.

03:22.917 --> 03:24.616
That's a very
generous offer.

03:24.618 --> 03:26.285
We'll pass.

03:26.287 --> 03:27.653
This is an
affidavit

03:27.655 --> 03:29.621
from the Essex County
Sheriff's Department.

03:29.623 --> 03:31.156
It states
that Mr. Conti

03:31.158 --> 03:34.393
was in their custody
on the evening in question.

03:34.395 --> 03:36.862
I assume Mr. Conti
cut a deal

03:36.864 --> 03:39.565
to testify in exchange for help
with his legal difficulties

03:39.567 --> 03:40.732
in New Jersey.

03:42.302 --> 03:44.403
You can't trust
anyone these days.

03:44.405 --> 03:47.072
You have no case, Ms. Reagan.

03:48.775 --> 03:50.776
If I were you...

03:50.778 --> 03:52.477
I would drop
the charges.

03:58.985 --> 04:00.652
What just happened?

04:00.654 --> 04:02.454
Conti's car was outside
the social club that night.

04:02.456 --> 04:03.622
There was no way to know

04:03.624 --> 04:06.592
he wasn't in it when
the murders went down.

04:06.594 --> 04:08.360
He saw a chance to make
a deal and he took it.

04:08.362 --> 04:10.696
Well, Dano is right
about one thing:

04:10.698 --> 04:12.798
Conti is a lying
sack of crap.

04:12.800 --> 04:13.932
So now what?

04:13.934 --> 04:14.967
We're mid-trial.

04:14.969 --> 04:17.269
If we don't find
another witness fast,

04:17.271 --> 04:19.471
that animal is gonna walk.

ERIN: I know this is
a high-profile prosecution,

04:52.101 --> 04:53.901
but what happened
was unforeseeable,

04:53.903 --> 04:55.202
and...

04:55.204 --> 04:56.403
Right.

04:56.405 --> 04:58.338
I will keep you updated.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.307
Acting D.A. is not happy.

05:00.309 --> 05:02.176
I got that.

05:02.178 --> 05:04.611
Dano is suspected in
seven other homicides

05:04.613 --> 05:05.879
that we know of.

05:05.881 --> 05:09.483
This office has unsuccessfully
prosecuted him twice before.

05:09.485 --> 05:11.452
And the D.A.'s not looking
to take the third strike.

05:11.454 --> 05:12.920
But with no eyewitness,

05:12.922 --> 05:14.788
the case is totally
circumstantial.

05:14.790 --> 05:15.989
There is
someone

05:15.991 --> 05:17.858
who saw Dano murder
those people.

05:17.860 --> 05:19.059
Vincent Rella.

05:19.061 --> 05:21.428
The Feds snatched him from me

05:21.430 --> 05:23.730
to testify in their RICO case.

05:23.732 --> 05:26.166
He was your star
witness against Dano.

05:26.168 --> 05:29.369
Operative word: "was."

05:29.371 --> 05:31.071
He's in the witness
protection program, Alex.

05:31.073 --> 05:32.406
Rella's gone.

05:34.275 --> 05:37.044
Not if the U.S. Attorney
makes a phone call.

05:37.046 --> 05:39.646
You want me to yank Rella
out of WITSEC

05:39.648 --> 05:41.315
to testify against Dano?

05:41.317 --> 05:43.717
The Feds are never
gonna go for that.

05:43.719 --> 05:46.286
You want to tell your boss
you're dropping the charges?

05:46.288 --> 05:47.855
'Cause he'll never go for that.

05:52.861 --> 05:54.695
JAMIE:
<i>These civilian patrols</i>

05:54.697 --> 05:56.230
and neighborhood watch groups

05:56.232 --> 05:58.131
can be more trouble than they're worth.
I don't know.

05:58.133 --> 06:00.534
We're always whining about how
the public doesn't appreciate us

06:00.536 --> 06:01.735
and here's a group of people

06:01.737 --> 06:03.370
who actually
want to help.

06:03.372 --> 06:04.872
Yeah, but the trouble is
they're not trained

06:04.874 --> 06:06.240
as police officers

06:06.242 --> 06:07.641
and they're a magnet
for cop wannabes.

06:07.643 --> 06:09.843
Hey, guys.

06:10.178 --> 06:11.144
Hey, Andy.

06:11.146 --> 06:12.546
Hey, Andy.
What are you doing here?

06:12.548 --> 06:15.349
Oh, I was just
following up on our collar.

06:16.818 --> 06:18.118
Well, she was 15.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.152
First offense.

06:19.154 --> 06:20.521
She was recogged
to her parents.

06:20.523 --> 06:22.956
Hmm. Hmm.

06:22.958 --> 06:25.859
Well, you know, I...
I envy you guys.

06:25.861 --> 06:29.129
I dreamed of being a cop
my whole life.

06:29.131 --> 06:30.797
Oh... what happened?

06:30.799 --> 06:33.000
Benign positional vertigo.

06:33.002 --> 06:34.801
Come again?

06:34.803 --> 06:37.004
I get dizzy
if I move my head too fast.

06:37.006 --> 06:38.772
Oh.
I can see how that would be a problem.

06:38.774 --> 06:39.806
Yeah.

06:39.808 --> 06:41.375
Hey, so, um, I've been tracking

06:41.377 --> 06:43.210
this local drug dealer
on that same block.

06:43.212 --> 06:45.846
Now, he sells right outside
an elementary school.

06:45.848 --> 06:48.849
So I thought we could all
work together to take him down.

06:48.851 --> 06:50.183
JAMIE: Well, you're not
supposed to be

06:50.185 --> 06:52.219
chasing bad guys, Andy.
It's dangerous.

06:53.855 --> 06:56.590
Hey, Andy, why don't you
give us the information

06:56.592 --> 06:58.158
and I promise
we'll check it out.

06:59.360 --> 07:00.727
(laughing)

07:00.729 --> 07:01.862
Well, 10-4.

07:01.864 --> 07:03.830
Uh, here is, uh,

07:03.832 --> 07:05.232
my surveillance log.

07:05.234 --> 07:07.634
The cell
number's inside.

07:07.636 --> 07:09.870
Call me, uh, whenever...

07:09.872 --> 07:11.371
Oh! I gotta run.

07:11.373 --> 07:13.273
I'm having my head
repositioned this afternoon.

07:13.275 --> 07:14.275
Good luck with that.

07:14.276 --> 07:15.309
Thank you.

07:15.311 --> 07:16.376
All right.

07:16.378 --> 07:18.245
What are you doing?

07:18.247 --> 07:20.013
Look at it.

07:20.015 --> 07:21.081
You're encouraging him.

07:21.083 --> 07:22.849
(clears throat)

07:22.851 --> 07:25.118
You guys are joking, right?

07:25.120 --> 07:27.821
Marshal Morgan,
I'm Erin Reagan...

07:27.823 --> 07:29.923
WITSEC's not a damn ATM.

07:29.925 --> 07:32.359
You can't make deposits
and withdrawals

07:32.361 --> 07:33.560
whenever you feel like it.

07:33.562 --> 07:34.962
It's just for a few days.

07:34.964 --> 07:38.732
Rella was a witness
in a major mob case.

07:38.734 --> 07:40.767
He shows his face
in New York City,

07:40.769 --> 07:42.135
he's as good as dead.

07:42.137 --> 07:44.237
We will protect him.

07:44.239 --> 07:45.672
Oh, is that the royal "we"?

07:45.674 --> 07:47.908
Because I'm not putting
any of my men in harm's way

07:47.910 --> 07:50.110
to protect
that lowlife skel ever again.

07:50.112 --> 07:51.478
Look--

07:51.480 --> 07:53.647
I understand
this is an unusual request.

07:53.649 --> 07:55.349
But Victor Dano is...

07:55.351 --> 07:56.316
Is a really bad guy.

07:56.318 --> 07:57.684
Yeah, I get it.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.486
But you're gonna
have to nail him

07:59.488 --> 08:00.854
without Vincent Rella.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.826
So much for the cooperation
of the federal government.

08:05.828 --> 08:07.794
They don't give a damn if Dano walks.
Of course not.

08:07.796 --> 08:10.364
They don't have to face
the families of the next victim.

08:13.267 --> 08:16.036
Violating the sanctity of
the witness protection program

08:16.038 --> 08:18.071
is a big deal.

08:18.073 --> 08:20.207
While we wouldn't be
breaking any laws...

08:20.209 --> 08:22.142
It would definitely
piss off the Feds.

08:22.144 --> 08:24.177
Question is,
how do we find Rella?

08:24.179 --> 08:26.446
Did you check
out his family?

08:26.448 --> 08:27.714
They disowned him years ago.

08:27.716 --> 08:30.984
I reviewed my notes
from the Rella deposition.

08:30.986 --> 08:33.120
He mentioned a granddaughter
named Melissa.

08:33.121 --> 08:35.554
Apparently, she was the
only one who showed up

08:35.557 --> 08:37.624
to say good-bye when
he entered WITSEC.

08:37.626 --> 08:39.292
You think she's still
in contact with him.

08:39.294 --> 08:41.662
Bring her in.

08:46.367 --> 08:48.735
Initial here, please.
(sighs)

08:50.371 --> 08:51.638
Thank you,
Baker.

08:51.640 --> 08:52.873
Where were we?

08:52.875 --> 08:53.875
The mayor.

08:53.876 --> 08:56.209
(sighs)

08:56.211 --> 08:57.811
He just asked me
to look into it.

08:57.813 --> 08:59.179
And make it go away?

08:59.181 --> 09:00.213
Unsaid.

09:00.215 --> 09:02.049
He did remind me

09:02.051 --> 09:03.417
to look at the big picture.

09:03.419 --> 09:05.185
Herrera and Poole are like
brother and sister.

09:05.187 --> 09:06.486
He's gonna fight
to keep her around.

09:06.488 --> 09:07.854
Well, his sister
lives with

09:07.856 --> 09:09.556
a criminal, by her own choice.

09:09.558 --> 09:10.824
Not our problem.

09:10.826 --> 09:12.826
If the mayor asks me
to review a case,

09:12.828 --> 09:15.629
I have an obligation
to review it.

09:15.631 --> 09:17.497
I made no promises.

09:17.499 --> 09:19.566
Well, smells bad to me, boss.

09:20.802 --> 09:23.303
Did you take the opportunity
to discuss the pension increase?

09:23.305 --> 09:25.038
Take the opportunity?

09:25.040 --> 09:26.540
You know what I mean.

09:26.542 --> 09:28.175
Yes, I do. So, no.

09:28.177 --> 09:29.710
All due respect, why not?

09:29.712 --> 09:32.779
If I put my own ask out there,

09:32.781 --> 09:36.383
it is tantamount to proposing
a quid pro quo.

09:36.385 --> 09:39.186
Right, no quid pro,
can't have that.

09:39.188 --> 09:40.854
You scratch my back,
I'll scratch yours.

09:40.856 --> 09:42.756
But a pension increase

09:42.758 --> 09:45.559
scratches the backs
of 35,000 NYPD.

09:45.561 --> 09:46.960
Who deserve it.

09:46.962 --> 09:48.095
And this mayor's

09:48.097 --> 09:51.198
been dragging his feet
on the bump since day one.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.366
This can't be that.

09:54.435 --> 09:57.571
Get me everything on
the circumstances of the arrest.

09:57.573 --> 09:59.773
Quietly.

09:59.775 --> 10:03.610
So, Melissa...
you're a junior at NYU?

10:04.612 --> 10:06.146
You sound surprised.

10:06.148 --> 10:09.382
I didn't mean it like that.

10:09.384 --> 10:11.518
I'm sorry.

10:11.520 --> 10:14.187
It's just not easy being
Vincent Rella's granddaughter.

10:14.189 --> 10:16.022
Are you two close?

10:16.024 --> 10:18.024
My mom cut Grandpa
out of her life years ago.

10:18.026 --> 10:19.826
So did the rest of my family.

10:19.828 --> 10:23.363
Are you still in touch
with your grandfather, Melissa?

10:23.365 --> 10:26.633
I'm not supposed
to talk about that.

10:26.635 --> 10:28.935
We know he's under
federal protection.

10:28.937 --> 10:31.471
I don't know where he is.

10:31.473 --> 10:35.776
Okay, but you speak to him
sometimes, right?

10:41.983 --> 10:44.951
He has a cell phone

10:44.953 --> 10:46.052
the marshals don't know about.

10:46.054 --> 10:47.387
ERIN:
We just want to speak

10:47.389 --> 10:48.889
with him, Melissa.

10:48.891 --> 10:50.891
Just to explain the situation.

10:50.893 --> 10:54.161
Whether he testifies
or not is totally up to him.

10:54.163 --> 10:55.929
Please don't ask me to do this.

10:55.931 --> 10:59.733
I know we're putting you
in a very difficult position.

10:59.735 --> 11:02.269
But the guy that we are after

11:02.271 --> 11:04.137
killed two little girls.

11:04.139 --> 11:07.073
We really need
your grandfather's help.

11:24.692 --> 11:26.660
Just...

11:26.662 --> 11:28.962
don't tell him
where you got the number.

11:28.964 --> 11:30.330
We won't.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.133
Thank you.

11:40.875 --> 11:42.809
"515."

11:42.811 --> 11:44.845
That's an Iowa area code.

11:44.847 --> 11:47.147
You really think
you're gonna convince Rella

11:47.149 --> 11:48.648
to testify over the phone?

11:48.650 --> 11:50.584
Do you have a better idea?

11:50.586 --> 11:53.453
You know what they say--

11:53.455 --> 11:55.622
showing up is half the battle.

12:01.128 --> 12:02.829
(siren chirping)

12:02.831 --> 12:05.031
Caller said there was
only one shooter.

12:09.537 --> 12:11.104
(softly):
Guys, over here.

12:11.106 --> 12:12.172
Andy, what's going on?

12:12.174 --> 12:13.206
Okay, okay, you know

12:13.208 --> 12:14.674
that drug dealer
I told you about?

12:14.676 --> 12:16.543
He was arguing with a customer
and he pulled out his gun,

12:16.545 --> 12:17.611
and he started shooting.

12:17.613 --> 12:18.845
You chased after him?!

12:18.847 --> 12:20.780
No, no, he saw my car
and he ran into the courtyard.

12:20.782 --> 12:23.049
He's, like, he's behind this big
brick building on the left.

12:23.051 --> 12:24.818
All right, back up. Get back
to the street, all right, Andy?

12:24.820 --> 12:26.219
Stay back.
Go.

12:26.221 --> 12:28.221
(wind whistling)

12:32.126 --> 12:33.159
All right, I'm gonna go around,
look for cover,

12:33.161 --> 12:34.561
all right?
Okay.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.583
(gasps)

12:58.052 --> 13:00.120
No one's been shot!
Give it up!

13:00.122 --> 13:01.755
You could walk on this.

13:01.757 --> 13:03.023
JAMIE:
Drop the gun

13:03.025 --> 13:04.024
and get down on the ground!

13:04.026 --> 13:05.091
Drop your weapon!

13:05.093 --> 13:07.227
(shell casing clattering)

13:07.229 --> 13:10.196
Come on, drop your weapon!

13:11.165 --> 13:12.899
Hey, Andy, no!

13:12.901 --> 13:14.234
Get back!

13:15.236 --> 13:16.736
(gunshot)
(screams)

13:16.738 --> 13:19.039
(Andy groaning)

13:20.574 --> 13:22.242
I got shot!

13:24.679 --> 13:25.879
(grunts)

13:25.881 --> 13:27.614
Drop it!
Get down on the ground!

13:27.616 --> 13:28.815
Police, don't move!

13:29.817 --> 13:31.151
(gunshots)

13:37.925 --> 13:40.026
ANDY:
Oh, my God.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.594
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.465
ANDY:
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

13:47.802 --> 13:49.502
12 David to Central.

13:49.504 --> 13:50.770
Shots fired at
this location.

13:50.772 --> 13:51.972
Oh, my God.
Get him over.

13:51.974 --> 13:54.007
Get him up.
(groaning)

13:54.009 --> 13:55.442
Sit tight, Andy,
I'm coming.

13:55.444 --> 13:57.510
Oh, God, oh, my God.

14:02.950 --> 14:05.085
Central, 12 David.

14:05.087 --> 14:06.686
I need a bus
at this location forthwith.

14:06.688 --> 14:07.887
Read, two males shot.

14:07.889 --> 14:08.989
We got one under.

14:08.991 --> 14:10.390
I got one perp
and one civilian.

14:10.392 --> 14:12.993
10-4, 12 David.

14:15.329 --> 14:16.930
Jamie?

14:17.765 --> 14:18.898
He's dead.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.734
ANDY:
Am I gonna die?

14:20.736 --> 14:22.602
JAMIE:
Calm down.

14:22.604 --> 14:24.771
(Andy groaning)

14:41.977 --> 14:44.045
Hey, how'd it go with
the Borough Shooting Team?

14:44.047 --> 14:45.413
I told them exactly
what happened.

14:45.415 --> 14:47.148
The perp aimed
his gun at me.

14:47.150 --> 14:48.349
I didn't have a choice.

14:48.351 --> 14:50.184
End of story.

14:50.186 --> 14:51.719
I told them the same thing.

14:51.721 --> 14:53.921
It was a clean shoot, Eddie.

14:55.724 --> 14:57.525
How's Andy?

14:57.527 --> 14:59.327
I called the hospital;
he's gonna be fine.

15:00.729 --> 15:02.730
Look...

15:02.732 --> 15:04.932
I know what
you're going through.

15:04.934 --> 15:07.168
I've been there myself.

15:09.772 --> 15:12.573
You never told me
you killed anybody.

15:12.575 --> 15:13.941
Guy wanted to commit suicide.

15:13.943 --> 15:16.110
He used me to do it.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.249
Did you have a choice?

15:22.584 --> 15:24.786
No.

15:25.621 --> 15:28.022
I still...

15:28.024 --> 15:29.991
felt bad about it, though,

15:29.993 --> 15:31.492
taking somebody's life,

15:31.494 --> 15:33.528
whether they're asking
for it or not.

15:33.530 --> 15:35.496
Hard to just
put that in a box.

15:35.498 --> 15:38.066
Yeah, it's part of the job.

15:38.068 --> 15:42.070
I'm just saying,
if you want to talk about it...

15:42.072 --> 15:43.471
You know what I really want?

15:43.473 --> 15:45.807
I want to get
this dog and pony show over with

15:45.809 --> 15:47.975
so I can get back on the street.

15:55.050 --> 15:57.218
ALEX: <i>I had no idea</i>
<i>it got so cold in Iowa.</i>

15:57.220 --> 15:59.754
The guy at the gas station
looked at us

15:59.756 --> 16:02.523
like we were from Mars
when I asked for directions.

16:02.525 --> 16:04.425
We don't exactly fit in.

16:05.160 --> 16:06.594
Especially as a couple.

16:11.867 --> 16:13.334
There's our guy.

16:23.846 --> 16:25.947
How's it going, Vincent?

16:26.749 --> 16:28.316
Relax.

16:28.318 --> 16:30.051
We're not here to kill you.

16:30.053 --> 16:33.054
You nearly gave me
a freaking heart attack.

16:33.056 --> 16:34.589
I'm A.D.A. Erin Reagan.

16:34.591 --> 16:35.790
Do you remember me?

16:35.792 --> 16:37.392
Yeah, I remember you.

16:37.394 --> 16:40.728
You're the D.A. prosecuting
Victor Dano.

16:42.398 --> 16:43.798
What are you doing here?

16:43.800 --> 16:45.533
After we lost you to the Feds,

16:45.535 --> 16:47.535
we found ourselves
another witness.

16:47.537 --> 16:48.836
Thomas Conti.

16:48.838 --> 16:50.338
He's a lying sack of crap.

16:50.340 --> 16:52.507
Yeah, we found that out
the hard way.

16:53.809 --> 16:56.344
I don't know how the hell
you found me here,

16:56.346 --> 16:59.046
but you being here jams me up.

16:59.048 --> 17:00.281
I don't like it.

17:00.283 --> 17:03.384
We need you to testify
against Dano, Vincent.

17:03.386 --> 17:04.952
Let me tell you something.

17:04.954 --> 17:08.890
Victor Dano is a merciless,
stone-cold killer

17:08.892 --> 17:11.092
who would whack his mother
for 50Gs.

17:11.094 --> 17:12.260
He would.

17:12.262 --> 17:13.961
But I ain't out here
for my health.

17:13.963 --> 17:17.298
You see, there's a very
big price for me back East.

17:17.300 --> 17:19.500
I give you my word,
I can get you in and out

17:19.502 --> 17:21.068
of the city in 72 hours.

17:21.069 --> 17:23.171
Yeah. You know something?

17:23.173 --> 17:25.039
There is nothing
that I want more

17:25.040 --> 17:27.675
than a decent plate of pasta.

17:28.911 --> 17:31.078
But I ain't gonna die for it.

17:33.749 --> 17:35.249
Mr. Rella, please.

17:35.251 --> 17:36.818
Name is Peters.

17:36.820 --> 17:38.986
Vincent Peters.

17:43.025 --> 17:45.393
(bell jingles)

17:50.065 --> 17:52.934
ALEX: I know we're kind of screwed
right now,

17:52.936 --> 17:54.936
but this loose meat
pork sandwich

17:54.938 --> 17:57.238
is incredible.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.774
If we don't bring Vincent back
with us to New York City,

17:59.776 --> 18:00.908
the next sandwich you have

18:00.910 --> 18:03.177
is not gonna be
made out of pork.

18:04.446 --> 18:05.680
Wow.

18:05.682 --> 18:07.215
How about getting a judge

18:07.217 --> 18:08.916
to sign off
on a material witness order?

18:08.918 --> 18:10.785
No judge is going to order

18:10.787 --> 18:12.253
a witness out of
federal protection.

18:12.255 --> 18:15.056
We need to convince Vincent to
come back with us voluntarily.

18:15.058 --> 18:17.191
Come on, Erin,
Vincent is a career criminal.

18:17.193 --> 18:19.260
The only reason this dude
is still alive is 'cause

18:19.262 --> 18:20.761
he ratted out guys
even worse than him.

18:20.763 --> 18:22.697
How are you supposed to appeal
to a guy like that?

18:22.699 --> 18:24.565
By figuring out
what they love.

18:24.567 --> 18:26.133
Then we got a serious problem,

18:26.135 --> 18:28.703
'cause the only thing
Vincent loves is himself.

18:28.705 --> 18:30.905
Maybe.

18:33.375 --> 18:36.477
But he wasn't calling himself
every Sunday night, was he?

18:37.179 --> 18:39.046
FRANK:
<i>Ray McClain</i>

18:39.048 --> 18:41.782
exited a bar
in the 117th precinct.

18:41.784 --> 18:43.150
There was a funeral

18:43.152 --> 18:45.720
in progress next door.

18:45.722 --> 18:47.021
McClain was drunk

18:47.023 --> 18:48.990
and started
shouting obscenities.

18:48.992 --> 18:52.159
He repeatedly ignored
Officer Butler's order

18:52.161 --> 18:56.297
to quiet down, so the officer
placed him under arrest.

18:58.767 --> 19:01.102
(sighs)
Okay.

19:01.104 --> 19:03.204
It's not like
he hurt anyone, right?

19:03.206 --> 19:06.841
If you don't count the parents
burying their 15-year-old son.

19:06.843 --> 19:10.344
Frank, I'm not standing up
for Ray McClain

19:10.346 --> 19:12.446
or asking you to.

19:12.448 --> 19:15.049
But Sylvia Herrera
is my right hand.

19:15.051 --> 19:16.517
I can't afford to lose her.

19:17.786 --> 19:19.687
"Afford."

19:19.689 --> 19:21.389
Why? What's the price here?

19:21.391 --> 19:23.090
No one said anything
about price.

19:23.092 --> 19:24.325
Don't raise the stakes.

19:24.327 --> 19:26.427
You raised the stakes
the minute you asked me

19:26.429 --> 19:27.895
to look into a simple arrest.

19:27.897 --> 19:30.131
Okay, Frank, time out.

19:31.667 --> 19:33.501
I don't answer to you.

19:33.503 --> 19:35.570
You answer to me.

19:35.572 --> 19:37.438
I know that.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.273
Then show that you know that.

19:51.987 --> 19:54.155
(sighs)

19:55.557 --> 19:58.559
Frank, I can help
in moving along the increase

19:58.561 --> 20:01.729
in the NYPD's pension funding.

20:01.731 --> 20:03.531
(sighs)

20:03.533 --> 20:05.967
That's common knowledge.

20:05.969 --> 20:07.234
That's all you have to say?

20:07.236 --> 20:08.402
No.

20:08.404 --> 20:09.604
No?

20:09.606 --> 20:12.006
You and I know these two issues

20:12.008 --> 20:13.874
do not belong side by side.

20:13.876 --> 20:15.543
Frank, I didn't place them
side by side.

20:15.545 --> 20:16.877
I changed the subject.

20:16.879 --> 20:18.012
I misunderstood.

20:18.014 --> 20:19.046
Yes, you did.

20:19.048 --> 20:21.115
Got it.

20:21.117 --> 20:23.351
An increase that,

20:23.353 --> 20:25.052
by all accounts,
is long overdue.

20:25.054 --> 20:26.921
We agree on that.

20:26.923 --> 20:28.422
In a tough fiscal year.

20:30.926 --> 20:33.227
(sighs)
Mayor Poole,

20:33.229 --> 20:36.364
tell me something I don't know.

20:38.233 --> 20:40.001
Frank, I am quite confident

20:40.003 --> 20:43.070
there isn't anything that
you don't already know.

20:52.314 --> 20:53.681
<i>Marone.</i>

20:53.683 --> 20:55.950
What part of "no"
don't you understand?

20:55.952 --> 20:57.318
The "N" or the "O"?

20:57.320 --> 20:58.919
I am not

20:58.921 --> 21:02.490
gonna testify
against Victor Dano, okay?

21:02.492 --> 21:04.992
And nothing you say
is gonna change my mind.

21:04.994 --> 21:06.427
I know.

21:10.365 --> 21:11.666
Melissa?

21:11.668 --> 21:14.035
What are you doing dragging
my granddaughter into this?

21:14.037 --> 21:15.403
What's the matter with you?
I wanted to come, Grandpa.

21:15.405 --> 21:17.672
You got no right whatsoever...
Vincent,

21:17.674 --> 21:20.241
Vincent, hear her out.

21:20.243 --> 21:22.910
Honey, this is my life.

21:22.912 --> 21:24.578
It's not yours.

21:24.580 --> 21:26.781
Okay.

21:27.616 --> 21:29.684
Before you left,

21:29.686 --> 21:32.653
you said you wished
you'd been a good man.

21:35.023 --> 21:37.124
Victor Dano killed
a lot of people.

21:37.126 --> 21:38.225
If you can keep him

21:38.227 --> 21:41.629
from hurting anyone else,

21:41.631 --> 21:44.098
isn't that what a good man
would do?

21:47.836 --> 21:50.805
Please.

22:06.035 --> 22:07.436
We've arranged
for you to stay

22:07.438 --> 22:08.704
in the federal
witness apartment.

22:08.706 --> 22:10.072
You'll be safe there.

22:10.074 --> 22:12.307
Yeah, that's where they stuck me
for the RICO trial.

22:12.309 --> 22:14.643
All they got is basic cable.

22:14.645 --> 22:16.211
You testify,

22:16.213 --> 22:18.580
then it's back to your
satellite dish in Iowa.

22:18.582 --> 22:19.582
Yeah.

22:19.583 --> 22:21.316
You remember the deal, right?

22:21.318 --> 22:23.085
Pasta fazool from
John and Tony's.

22:23.087 --> 22:25.020
And don't forget
the stuffed mushrooms.

22:25.022 --> 22:26.022
I got it.

22:26.023 --> 22:27.023
MORGAN:
Well...

22:27.024 --> 22:28.957
Look what the cat dragged in.

22:28.959 --> 22:30.292
Hey, Morgan.

22:30.294 --> 22:31.294
How they hangin'?

22:31.295 --> 22:32.794
ERIN:
Mr. Rella is here

22:32.796 --> 22:33.896
voluntarily.

22:33.898 --> 22:35.097
No laws have been broken.

22:35.099 --> 22:36.999
Hmm.
So what are you doing down here?

22:37.001 --> 22:38.233
We've arranged for him to stay

22:38.235 --> 22:39.735
in the apartment
until he testifies.

22:39.737 --> 22:41.336
Ooh.

22:41.338 --> 22:43.338
Sorry.

22:43.340 --> 22:44.506
We need it for a legit witness

22:44.508 --> 22:46.241
in a federal
narcotics trial.

22:46.243 --> 22:48.443
I cleared this with
the supervising marshal.

22:48.445 --> 22:50.445
Who works for me.

22:50.447 --> 22:53.048
You disrespected
federal jurisdiction.

22:53.050 --> 22:54.483
And it'll be

22:54.485 --> 22:55.684
a cold day in hell

22:55.686 --> 22:57.986
before any of my men
protect this joker again.

22:57.988 --> 22:59.521
Oh...

22:59.523 --> 23:00.722
I'm hurt.

23:00.724 --> 23:02.424
Not yet.

23:02.426 --> 23:04.359
But you just got here.

23:08.131 --> 23:10.065
Good luck keeping him alive

23:10.067 --> 23:12.501
once his mob pals
find out he's home.

23:21.277 --> 23:23.011
Hey.

23:23.013 --> 23:24.646
Boss just told me
that the Shooting Team

23:24.648 --> 23:26.181
ruled that your actions
were justified.

23:26.183 --> 23:27.149
You've been cleared.

23:27.151 --> 23:29.351
Yeah.

23:29.353 --> 23:32.454
I mean, I knew
I didn't do anything wrong.

23:32.456 --> 23:34.623
A lot of cops been jammed
up on clean shoots, Eddie.

23:34.625 --> 23:35.757
Congratulations.

23:35.759 --> 23:37.292
It's not like I won
the World Series.

23:37.294 --> 23:38.593
You might have
won something.

23:38.595 --> 23:39.861
Huh?

23:39.863 --> 23:42.631
Boss is putting you
in for a medal.

23:42.633 --> 23:43.832
Seriously?

23:43.834 --> 23:46.368
Hey, you protected the
lives of your partner

23:46.370 --> 23:48.003
and a member of the
Civilian Patrol.

23:48.005 --> 23:50.138
No, you know...
I killed a guy

23:50.140 --> 23:52.074
before he killed me.

23:52.076 --> 23:53.208
I'm not a hero.

23:53.210 --> 23:55.911
I don't want a damn medal.

23:58.214 --> 23:59.915
Let me get this straight.

23:59.917 --> 24:01.817
McClain walks and the
members of this department

24:01.819 --> 24:03.352
get a major
pension hike?

24:03.354 --> 24:04.319
Sure sounded like that.

24:04.321 --> 24:05.620
Hah!

24:05.622 --> 24:07.756
Compared to this, the Dutch
overpaid for Manhattan.

24:07.758 --> 24:08.690
(laughs)

24:08.692 --> 24:09.725
FRANK:
Our cops

24:09.727 --> 24:10.826
risk their lives every day.

24:10.828 --> 24:11.860
I don't think they'd want me

24:11.862 --> 24:14.162
trading their arrests
for political favors.

24:14.164 --> 24:16.665
If it means they retire with
more money in their pockets,

24:16.667 --> 24:18.300
I promise you,
they'll be fine with it.

24:18.302 --> 24:20.135
We finally get some leverage
with the mayor

24:20.137 --> 24:21.269
and you're not gonna use it?

24:21.271 --> 24:23.305
I'd be handing him
a silver bullet.

24:23.307 --> 24:24.206
How?

24:24.208 --> 24:25.374
Well, think about it.

24:25.376 --> 24:26.376
Say there's a next time

24:26.377 --> 24:27.876
he asks me to step
over the line for him,

24:27.878 --> 24:29.277
and there's always
a next time...

24:29.279 --> 24:30.812
He owns you,
from the first time.

24:30.814 --> 24:32.814
Yeah.
So any favor you do for him

24:32.816 --> 24:33.982
he's gonna against you.

24:33.984 --> 24:35.250
Exactly.

24:35.252 --> 24:37.519
I'm not saying he would,
but he could.

24:37.521 --> 24:39.921
And that's an unacceptable risk.

24:41.190 --> 24:42.891
What did you get me into,
here, huh?

24:42.893 --> 24:44.192
Take it easy, Vincent.

24:44.194 --> 24:45.227
We're going to keep you safe.

24:45.229 --> 24:48.030
Yeah? Forget
about the wiseguys.

24:48.032 --> 24:49.898
The marshals
are gonna take me out.

24:49.900 --> 24:51.299
We're gonna protect you.

24:51.301 --> 24:52.768
Oh, you're gonna protect me.

24:52.770 --> 24:53.835
Who? You...

24:53.837 --> 24:56.405
and beauty queen
over here?

24:56.407 --> 24:58.140
No. I got a better idea.

24:58.142 --> 25:00.042
Take me back to
the airport right now.

25:00.044 --> 25:01.476
DANNY:
Forget about the airport.

25:01.478 --> 25:03.245
Traffic's murder
this time of night.

25:03.247 --> 25:04.713
You run this by your boss?

25:04.715 --> 25:06.248
Yeah, we're good to go.

25:06.250 --> 25:09.117
Vincent Rella, Detectives
Reagan and Baez, NYPD.

25:09.119 --> 25:11.286
Your new guardian angels.

25:13.856 --> 25:14.923
Now we're getting somewhere.

25:14.925 --> 25:16.792
BAEZ: We have a safe house
set up for Vincent.

25:16.794 --> 25:18.293
We'll help Alex
get him to court,

25:18.295 --> 25:19.494
then back to the airport.

25:19.496 --> 25:21.096
Great. We owe you guys.

25:21.098 --> 25:22.130
Don't worry.

25:22.132 --> 25:23.965
We'll be sure to remind you.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.507
Thanks.

25:35.078 --> 25:37.112
How's your partner
holding up?

25:38.981 --> 25:40.549
I don't know.

25:40.551 --> 25:42.350
Uh, she says she's okay.

25:42.352 --> 25:43.985
She says, or she is?

25:43.987 --> 25:45.954
That's the question, all right.

25:45.956 --> 25:47.222
Yeah, well,
who could just be okay?

25:47.224 --> 25:48.390
Huh? You take a life?

25:48.392 --> 25:50.392
FRANK: Well, you have to be
okay in the sense

25:50.394 --> 25:51.827
that it comes
with the territory.

25:51.829 --> 25:53.028
But you're right, Linda.

25:53.030 --> 25:54.863
You can't just be "okay"
in the sense

25:54.865 --> 25:56.264
that you're immune
to the stakes of it.

25:56.266 --> 25:57.766
ERIN:
I'm prosecuting a guy

25:57.768 --> 25:59.734
who doesn't think twice
about killing.

25:59.736 --> 26:01.002
In fact, I think he enjoys it.

26:01.004 --> 26:02.471
Well, that's why
we're out there.

26:02.473 --> 26:04.206
Well, isn't killing wrong
no matter who does it?

26:04.208 --> 26:05.340
DANNY:
It's always wrong

26:05.342 --> 26:06.641
to the person who gets killed.

26:06.643 --> 26:07.876
Yeah, it's complicated,
honey.

26:07.878 --> 26:09.611
It seems pretty
simple to me.

26:09.613 --> 26:11.546
DANNY:
Yeah. And to a lot of people.

26:11.548 --> 26:12.814
And they're lucky for it.

26:12.816 --> 26:15.650
But the cops, we don't
really have that luxury.

26:15.652 --> 26:17.719
Not luxury, but...

26:17.721 --> 26:19.688
Choice.
DANNY: Choice.

26:19.690 --> 26:20.889
Yeah, choice.

26:20.891 --> 26:22.390
You choose to go on this job,

26:22.392 --> 26:24.059
you know you may be put
in a position one day

26:24.061 --> 26:25.660
where you take the life
of someone

26:25.662 --> 26:27.729
you never met
before that moment.

26:27.731 --> 26:28.864
This kid Walter, in my class,

26:28.866 --> 26:30.632
said that cops shoot people
for no reason.

26:30.634 --> 26:32.901
Do you believe that?

26:32.903 --> 26:34.035
No.

26:34.037 --> 26:35.837
But that's
what he says.

26:35.839 --> 26:37.405
Tell your friend Walter to think

26:37.407 --> 26:38.807
before he shoots his mouth off.

26:38.809 --> 26:40.008
Danny...

26:40.010 --> 26:42.077
Trust me, that was
the kid-friendly version, Linda.

26:42.079 --> 26:44.980
No cop steps on the street

26:44.982 --> 26:46.781
looking to take a life, Sean.

26:46.783 --> 26:49.117
But mistakes do happen.

26:49.119 --> 26:50.485
Yeah, tragically.

26:50.487 --> 26:52.287
As mistakes happen
in any endeavor

26:52.289 --> 26:53.655
where people are involved.

26:53.657 --> 26:54.823
And unfortunately,

26:54.825 --> 26:56.024
the mistakes
make the front page.

26:56.026 --> 26:57.759
And the stories that start,

26:57.761 --> 27:00.362
"I almost went for my weapon
and then I realized..."?

27:00.364 --> 27:01.963
Not so much.

27:01.965 --> 27:03.899
And there's
a million more of those.

27:03.901 --> 27:05.033
So you tell your friend Walter

27:05.035 --> 27:06.668
before he shoots
his mouth off again,

27:06.670 --> 27:09.004
check the crime stats.

27:09.006 --> 27:10.739
City's safer
than it's ever been.

27:10.741 --> 27:11.940
Knock on wood.

27:20.216 --> 27:23.218
So the boss says I have to go
to that damn medal ceremony.

27:23.220 --> 27:25.754
Yeah, well,
you getting decorated

27:25.756 --> 27:27.088
puts a shine on
the whole precinct.

27:27.090 --> 27:28.823
Can't they just send me
the stupid thing?

27:28.825 --> 27:30.125
It's no biggie.

27:30.127 --> 27:31.927
The whole deal takes
about an hour, tops.

27:31.929 --> 27:33.128
Oh.

27:34.030 --> 27:35.163
ANDY:
Hey, guys.

27:35.165 --> 27:37.732
Hey.
Saw your RMP parked out front.

27:37.734 --> 27:38.767
Hey, Andy,
how's the foot?

27:38.769 --> 27:40.035
Oh, thank you.

27:40.037 --> 27:42.037
Uh, well, the doctor says
I won't have a limp.

27:42.039 --> 27:43.905
So...
And... (laughs)

27:43.907 --> 27:45.173
it's the craziest thing,
you know?

27:45.175 --> 27:47.242
I-I haven't felt dizzy once
since I got shot.

27:47.244 --> 27:48.677
(laughs)

27:48.679 --> 27:50.919
Well, maybe you should've taken
a bullet a long time ago.

27:51.981 --> 27:53.348
(laughs)

27:53.350 --> 27:55.283
Yeah. Um...

27:55.285 --> 27:57.219
Well, I-I just... I just
came here to thank you guys.

27:57.221 --> 27:58.453
Uh, especially you,

27:58.455 --> 28:00.455
Officer Janko.
I mean...

28:00.457 --> 28:02.857
I owe you my life.

28:02.859 --> 28:04.125
So, uh...

28:04.127 --> 28:06.761
Oh. I have something for you.

28:06.763 --> 28:07.729
Uh, what's this?

28:07.731 --> 28:09.231
ANDY:
Um, well, I, uh,

28:09.233 --> 28:10.765
I prepare tax returns
on the side,

28:10.767 --> 28:13.435
and, uh, that entitles you
to three years free.

28:13.437 --> 28:15.337
Whoa.
ANDY: Yeah.

28:18.174 --> 28:19.874
Three years, huh?

28:19.876 --> 28:21.443
Is that the going rate
for killing a guy?

28:21.445 --> 28:23.478
(laughs nervously)

28:23.480 --> 28:25.213
I don't... understand...

28:25.215 --> 28:27.015
Eddie...
Well, I'm just...

28:27.017 --> 28:28.650
I'm just curious.

28:28.652 --> 28:30.819
If I, uh...

28:30.821 --> 28:32.821
well, if I killed two guys,
do I get six years?

28:36.225 --> 28:38.226
Look...

28:38.228 --> 28:39.461
I didn't mean to...

28:39.463 --> 28:40.428
You didn't mean to what?

28:40.430 --> 28:42.130
Make a dangerous situation
even worse?

28:42.132 --> 28:44.699
Almost get yourself killed,
almost get my partner

28:44.701 --> 28:46.935
and I killed
because of your

28:46.937 --> 28:50.005
ridiculous fantasies
about being a cop?

28:50.007 --> 28:50.905
Eddie,
that's enough.

28:50.907 --> 28:52.007
You know
what?

28:52.009 --> 28:53.341
What we do on that street?

28:53.343 --> 28:54.242
That's real.

28:54.244 --> 28:56.211
It's not some
video game

28:56.213 --> 28:57.345
that you get to play

28:57.347 --> 28:58.847
because you hate
your pathetic life.

28:58.849 --> 29:00.348
You know what, Andy?

29:00.350 --> 29:01.549
You should stick
with the tax returns

29:01.551 --> 29:03.818
before you get
somebody else killed.

29:13.729 --> 29:15.897
Come in.

29:21.404 --> 29:22.737
Sir!

29:22.739 --> 29:24.239
As you were, Officer Butler.

29:24.740 --> 29:26.875
Close the door.

29:29.812 --> 29:31.646
You're not on the hook
for anything.

29:31.648 --> 29:33.548
I'm just looking
for some answers, here.

29:33.550 --> 29:36.117
Thank you, sir.

29:37.887 --> 29:40.555
I just heard something.

29:40.557 --> 29:42.457
I heard you knocked down
the charges

29:42.459 --> 29:44.025
against Ray McClain.

29:44.027 --> 29:45.360
Why?

29:45.362 --> 29:47.262
Because he made a case.

29:47.264 --> 29:48.963
A case for...?

29:48.965 --> 29:50.865
The guy's on parole.

29:50.867 --> 29:52.367
The higher charge,
the misdemeanor,

29:52.369 --> 29:54.002
would've put him in violation.

29:54.004 --> 29:55.637
All he really did
was get into it

29:55.639 --> 29:57.806
with two individuals
in the funeral party.

29:57.808 --> 30:00.575
Disruption of
a funeral service--

30:00.577 --> 30:02.210
that's a class "A" misdemeanor.

30:02.212 --> 30:03.478
He didn't really disrupt.

30:03.480 --> 30:06.648
He did have words
with two members of the party

30:06.650 --> 30:09.417
who made some comments
about the cap he was wearing.

30:09.419 --> 30:10.885
It was a Red Sox cap, sir.

30:10.887 --> 30:12.253
You know how that can go.

30:12.255 --> 30:13.988
Yeah.

30:13.990 --> 30:16.791
I just didn't think he should
go back to prison for it.

30:18.961 --> 30:21.696
I'm gonna ask you a question

30:21.698 --> 30:23.698
and I expect an honest answer.

30:25.167 --> 30:29.671
Did anybody
talk to you about this?

30:29.673 --> 30:31.373
Anyone from One PP?

30:31.375 --> 30:32.774
No, sir.

30:32.776 --> 30:35.443
Anyone from the mayor's office?

30:35.445 --> 30:37.078
The mayor's office?

30:37.080 --> 30:39.047
You're not on the hook, here.

30:39.049 --> 30:41.249
I just need the truth.

30:44.553 --> 30:45.987
Uh... the truth is, sir,

30:45.989 --> 30:49.157
that if the mayor's office
had reached out,

30:49.159 --> 30:51.760
I would never have
reduced those charge.

30:51.762 --> 30:53.995
All due respect, sir,
I'm not a fan of the mayor.

30:54.830 --> 30:56.398
No?

30:56.400 --> 30:58.500
I'm a year away from retirement.

30:58.502 --> 31:00.969
With pension the way it is,
I'm looking for security work

31:00.971 --> 31:03.405
because my pension,
it won't cut it.

31:03.407 --> 31:05.440
And I blame the mayor for that.

31:11.080 --> 31:12.714
Okay.

31:13.682 --> 31:16.184
How'd I do, counselor?

31:16.186 --> 31:18.920
Your testimony was a slam dunk.

31:18.922 --> 31:20.722
Dano's lawyer has already called

31:20.724 --> 31:23.158
to see if the deal's
still on the table and it's not.

31:23.160 --> 31:24.160
Beautiful.

31:24.161 --> 31:25.593
You took a real chance

31:25.595 --> 31:26.928
to come back here.

31:26.930 --> 31:28.163
Thank you.

31:28.165 --> 31:30.465
If you're ever in Iowa...

31:30.467 --> 31:32.167
I will bring the pasta.

31:33.002 --> 31:34.702
Here. Put these on.

31:43.479 --> 31:45.680
Let's get you
out of here.

31:47.116 --> 31:48.616
This way.

31:51.620 --> 31:53.321
DANNY:
Convoy's waiting for you outside

31:53.323 --> 31:55.590
100 Centre Street.
Take you to the airport.

31:56.292 --> 31:57.859
ALEX:
We got company.

31:57.861 --> 31:59.661
(gunfire)

31:59.663 --> 32:01.463
(people screaming)

32:03.065 --> 32:05.300
DANNY:
Cover him!

32:09.271 --> 32:12.140
You okay?
You okay?

32:17.179 --> 32:18.480
Stay down, Erin!

32:18.482 --> 32:19.647
Anybody hurt?

32:19.649 --> 32:21.349
Nah, we're okay.
But let's get out of here!

32:21.351 --> 32:23.451
Come on. Move.
Come on, let's go.

32:39.416 --> 32:40.448
Everyone okay?

32:40.450 --> 32:41.483
Yeah.

32:41.485 --> 32:42.417
Reagan!

32:42.419 --> 32:43.618
Speaking of
irritating...

32:43.620 --> 32:45.453
I should've known
this was your mess.

32:45.455 --> 32:46.955
Yeah, good to see you,
too, Morgan.

32:46.957 --> 32:48.790
Now how the hell you plan
to get this man out of here?

32:48.792 --> 32:49.991
We're working on it.

32:49.993 --> 32:51.192
Vincent's pals
know we're in here.

32:51.194 --> 32:52.360
Gotta move fast.

32:54.130 --> 32:55.263
So what's the call?

32:57.233 --> 32:59.634
We're walking him
the front door,

32:59.636 --> 33:01.870
putting him right in a car,
straight to the airport.

33:01.872 --> 33:03.805
Ha! That's your plan?

33:03.807 --> 33:05.039
Yeah, that's the plan. Come on.

33:05.041 --> 33:06.174
Nice knowing you, Reagan.

33:06.176 --> 33:07.208
He's got a
point, Danny.

33:07.210 --> 33:09.310
They'll have all
the exits covered.

33:09.312 --> 33:11.546
That's exactly
what I'm hoping for.

33:11.548 --> 33:12.614
Come on.

33:12.616 --> 33:15.049
Get out of the way.

33:31.901 --> 33:33.868
♪

33:55.524 --> 33:58.560
♪

34:21.917 --> 34:24.418
♪

34:32.094 --> 34:34.362
Come on.

34:58.921 --> 35:01.890
Black sedan
about 75 yards back.

35:01.892 --> 35:03.558
Yeah, they're
following us.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.159
Nice work, partner.

35:05.161 --> 35:06.728
It's not my first rodeo.

35:06.730 --> 35:10.598
Don't pull a muscle patting
yourself on the back, Reagan.

35:10.600 --> 35:13.635
You know, why do you got
to be like that, Morgan?

35:13.637 --> 35:15.236
Come on, we're a team now.

35:15.238 --> 35:16.771
Dream on.

35:16.773 --> 35:19.240
I only did this so Rella's
brains wouldn't get splattered

35:19.242 --> 35:20.675
all over the courthouse steps.

35:20.677 --> 35:24.112
Well, whatever the
reason, we owe you one.

35:24.114 --> 35:27.081
Just promise me I'll never
have to work with you,

35:27.083 --> 35:30.118
your sister, or anybody else
named Reagan ever again,

35:30.120 --> 35:31.586
and we'll call it
square.

35:31.588 --> 35:32.954
Okay, how about Baez?

35:32.956 --> 35:34.822
Her, too. So where
are we headed?

35:34.824 --> 35:36.424
DANNY:
Westchester Airport.

35:36.426 --> 35:37.859
We'll give these clowns
a nickel tour

35:37.861 --> 35:39.227
and collar 'em
when we get there.

35:39.229 --> 35:40.962
Should give McBride
plenty of time

35:40.964 --> 35:42.297
to get Rella to LaGuardia.

35:42.299 --> 35:43.631
All right.

35:43.633 --> 35:45.133
Wake me when we get there.

35:47.803 --> 35:49.971
(sighs)

35:53.509 --> 35:55.843
VINCENT:
I made a deal with the Feds

35:55.845 --> 35:58.880
so I wouldn't have to wear
one of these things again.

35:58.882 --> 36:00.882
You can change back
into your own clothes

36:00.884 --> 36:02.216
when you get
to the airport.

36:02.218 --> 36:03.718
Eh.

36:03.720 --> 36:05.219
Look at this.

36:05.221 --> 36:06.921
Unbelievable.

36:07.790 --> 36:10.758
I'm escaping the mob
in a police van.

36:10.760 --> 36:13.528
I tell you, that brother
of yours is very clever.

36:13.530 --> 36:16.331
He would have made
a good wiseguy.

36:16.333 --> 36:17.665
(laughs)

36:17.667 --> 36:20.168
I'll make sure
to tell him you said so.

36:22.604 --> 36:25.039
Whoa, look at you.

36:25.041 --> 36:27.041
Where's a camera
when we need one?

36:27.043 --> 36:28.276
It's a good color on you.

36:28.278 --> 36:30.545
I didn't hear
you volunteering

36:30.547 --> 36:32.046
to escort him
back to Iowa.

36:32.048 --> 36:34.248
I've got closing
arguments to make.

36:34.250 --> 36:35.550
Hey.

36:35.552 --> 36:37.218
What if I get whacked

36:37.220 --> 36:39.554
by one of those guys
before we hit LaGuardia?

36:39.556 --> 36:41.556
Doubtful-- these guys
are all marshals and NYPD

36:41.558 --> 36:42.957
riding along
just in case.

36:42.959 --> 36:44.959
I don't believe it.

36:44.961 --> 36:47.195
I don't know who's
scarier-- you or the mob.

36:47.197 --> 36:50.031
(chuckles)

36:51.433 --> 36:53.701
Sweetheart.

36:53.703 --> 36:55.670
Hey, Grandpa.

36:55.672 --> 36:57.238
You have a few minutes
before the bus leaves.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.573
I thought you might want
to say good-bye.

36:58.575 --> 37:00.541
You know,

37:00.543 --> 37:05.146
I would never say this,
uh, in a courtroom--

37:05.148 --> 37:06.914
you two are okay.

37:06.916 --> 37:08.049
(laughs)
Ha!

37:08.051 --> 37:10.084
You travel safe,
Vincent.

37:10.086 --> 37:11.786
Thank you, Erin.

37:13.689 --> 37:16.524
Hiya, dear.

37:17.693 --> 37:19.694
Okay, okay.

37:19.696 --> 37:21.396
All right, all right.

37:21.398 --> 37:22.997
You're my baby.

37:22.999 --> 37:24.332
Okay, okay.

37:24.334 --> 37:26.200
(crying)
Don't cry, no crying.

37:26.202 --> 37:28.469
Gonna make me cry in front
of these guys now? No.

37:28.471 --> 37:29.704
I want to hear
you laugh.

37:29.706 --> 37:31.439
(crying): Okay.
Okay.

37:31.441 --> 37:32.640
Okay, everything's okay.

37:32.642 --> 37:34.675
Okay.
Okay, all right, baby.

37:34.677 --> 37:36.110
I love you.

37:36.112 --> 37:38.212
(continues indistinctly)

37:41.083 --> 37:43.751
Armed with that
information

37:43.753 --> 37:46.954
and on further review
with his C.O.,

37:46.956 --> 37:50.625
Officer Butler thought
that justice was best served

37:50.627 --> 37:53.995
by reducing the charge
to disorderly conduct.

37:53.997 --> 37:55.196
With no reservations?

37:55.198 --> 37:57.265
None that he communicated to me.

37:57.267 --> 37:59.500
So you did speak with him,
personally.

37:59.502 --> 38:01.436
I did, yes.

38:01.438 --> 38:02.770
And he understood
that this was purely

38:02.772 --> 38:05.006
an NYPD inter-departmental
decision.

38:05.008 --> 38:07.675
He did, because it was.

38:09.478 --> 38:10.578
Thank you.

38:10.580 --> 38:12.780
Nothing to thank me for,
Mr. Mayor.

38:12.782 --> 38:15.316
I meant thank you
for the information, Frank,

38:15.318 --> 38:16.651
the good news.

38:16.653 --> 38:17.718
Of course.

38:17.720 --> 38:19.187
You're welcome.

38:21.056 --> 38:22.590
(clears throat)

38:22.592 --> 38:25.993
Officer Butler is
less than a year out

38:25.995 --> 38:27.695
from retirement, by the way.

38:29.198 --> 38:31.199
Is that right?

38:31.201 --> 38:32.800
Long service?

38:32.802 --> 38:34.502
22 years.

38:34.504 --> 38:36.304
Long and distinguished.

38:36.306 --> 38:37.306
Good for him.

38:37.307 --> 38:39.273
Less than a year out.

38:39.275 --> 38:42.510
You know how time can drag where
budget matters are concerned.

38:43.645 --> 38:46.247
Pensions.

38:46.249 --> 38:48.916
All of that.

38:48.918 --> 38:51.185
Yes.

38:51.187 --> 38:54.322
Glenn Butler deserves
your thanks.

38:54.324 --> 38:57.692
Frank, all the Glenn Butlers
deserve our thanks.

38:59.895 --> 39:02.063
Exactly.

39:09.705 --> 39:12.573
(knocking on door)

39:15.410 --> 39:16.544
Hi.

39:16.546 --> 39:17.812
Hey, I've been calling
you for hours.

39:17.814 --> 39:19.747
Where have you
been all day?

39:19.749 --> 39:21.449
Sorry, I just...

39:21.451 --> 39:24.185
I wasn't feeling well, so I told
the boss I needed to go home.

39:24.187 --> 39:26.554
What, you don't
give me a heads up?

39:26.556 --> 39:28.556
Yeah.

39:28.558 --> 39:30.258
Sorry.

39:30.260 --> 39:31.559
I'm fine.

39:31.561 --> 39:33.661
Could have fooled me.

39:34.796 --> 39:36.030
I'm not trying
to fool you.

39:36.032 --> 39:37.265
I'm not trying
to fool anybody.

39:37.267 --> 39:38.267
About anything.

39:38.268 --> 39:39.934
All right.

39:41.069 --> 39:42.770
Make yourself
a drink.

39:42.772 --> 39:44.939
I'm good.

39:46.842 --> 39:48.543
I can't cry.

39:48.545 --> 39:51.012
Nobody's asking you to.

39:51.014 --> 39:54.515
Oh, everybody's
asking me to.

39:54.517 --> 39:55.517
Cry.

39:55.518 --> 39:57.018
Let it out.

39:58.754 --> 40:01.822
So I watched
<i>Remember the Titans.</i>

40:01.824 --> 40:03.491
That always
makes me cry.

40:03.493 --> 40:05.193
But not today?

40:05.195 --> 40:06.928
Nope.

40:11.300 --> 40:13.000
I just keep
thinking--

40:13.002 --> 40:14.302
maybe if I'd done
something different,

40:14.304 --> 40:16.337
if I had given him
a way out,

40:16.339 --> 40:18.673
if... you know?

40:18.675 --> 40:20.675
He drew on you, Eddie.

40:20.677 --> 40:22.643
There was no other way out.

40:26.615 --> 40:28.316
Is this you?

40:29.952 --> 40:31.619
If you say one word
about my hair,

40:31.621 --> 40:32.920
I will shoot
you, too.

40:32.922 --> 40:34.355
(chuckles)
You know I'll shoot you.

40:34.357 --> 40:35.756
This...
Come on.

40:35.758 --> 40:37.391
You look amazing, actually.
Come on.

40:37.393 --> 40:39.193
That's a great
picture.

40:39.195 --> 40:41.062
I look like
what I was.

40:41.064 --> 40:43.264
A sheltered
happy kid.

40:45.467 --> 40:47.835
I look at my life
now, and I just...

40:47.837 --> 40:50.071
I don't even know
how I got here.

40:51.607 --> 40:55.343
My brother gave me some good
advice after my incident.

40:55.345 --> 40:56.644
He said--

40:56.646 --> 40:58.346
when you're looking
at something this big,

40:58.348 --> 41:00.314
don't go looking
for something bigger.

41:02.484 --> 41:04.719
The hell does that mean?

41:05.854 --> 41:07.888
It means don't go drawing
any big conclusions

41:07.890 --> 41:09.223
about your life right now.

41:09.225 --> 41:12.159
Just get through the day.

41:12.161 --> 41:14.595
And get through
the night.

41:16.298 --> 41:18.933
How long since
you slept?

41:22.471 --> 41:24.639
Too long.

41:28.443 --> 41:32.113
This is a really
bad guy.

41:32.115 --> 41:34.582
So why do I feel
so guilty?

41:36.084 --> 41:38.319
Because you're
a good guy.

41:42.924 --> 41:44.792
Thanks.

41:44.794 --> 41:46.727
It's true.

42:07.249 --> 42:10.184
Do you think that maybe
you could stay here tonight?

42:14.323 --> 42:16.290
I don't mean, like...

42:16.292 --> 42:18.459
No, I know.

42:24.700 --> 42:26.867
I need you.

42:30.038 --> 42:32.139
I'm not going anywhere.

42:36.078 --> 42:38.245
(crying)
