WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:03.420
Previously

00:02.085 --> 00:03.420
on  Malcolm in the Middle...

00:03.462 --> 00:04.546
Baby's a little bit

00:03.462 --> 00:04.546
bigger than expected.

00:04.588 --> 00:07.048
So we're going

00:04.588 --> 00:07.048
to induce labor on Thursday.

00:07.090 --> 00:09.134
MALCOLM:

00:07.090 --> 00:09.134
Festival of Brides?

00:09.176 --> 00:10.678
I just dropped 15 bucks

00:09.176 --> 00:10.678
on parking.

00:10.719 --> 00:11.762
We're going in.

00:11.804 --> 00:13.973
Baby just started

00:11.804 --> 00:13.973
kicking like crazy.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.808
It's almost like

00:14.014 --> 00:15.808
something was

00:14.014 --> 00:15.808
upsetting...

00:16.976 --> 00:18.059
Mom!

00:18.101 --> 00:20.061
I'm moving in.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.522
Everybody decent?

00:21.563 --> 00:23.774
God, I'm having a contraction.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.774
I'm going into labor.

00:23.816 --> 00:25.776
What?

00:23.816 --> 00:25.776
I have to get to the hospital.

00:25.818 --> 00:27.068
Got it on

00:25.818 --> 00:27.068
the oldies station.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.445
They're doing a

00:27.110 --> 00:28.445
Beatles "A" to "Z."

00:28.487 --> 00:32.157
So I'm just going

00:28.487 --> 00:32.157
to make myself some tea

00:32.199 --> 00:34.827
and relax until you get here.

01:14.366 --> 01:16.117
These contractions

01:14.366 --> 01:16.117
are coming so close together!

01:16.159 --> 01:16.994
Oh!

01:17.036 --> 01:18.620
(screams)

01:20.163 --> 01:21.916
Lois, you have to stop

01:20.163 --> 01:21.916
doing that.

01:21.957 --> 01:23.625
You are really

01:21.957 --> 01:23.625
freaking me out.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.168
Yeah, me, too, Lois.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.168
And I'm a doctor.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.170
We can't wait for Hal anymore.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.339
We've got to go

01:27.212 --> 01:29.339
to the hospital now!

01:29.381 --> 01:31.132
You really think

01:29.381 --> 01:31.132
you're ever going

01:31.174 --> 01:32.843
to see your husband again?

01:31.174 --> 01:32.843
Mom!

01:32.885 --> 01:35.012
He's a man, isn't he?

01:35.054 --> 01:36.137
He's had his way with you.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.057
What's he need

01:36.179 --> 01:38.057
to stick around for?

01:38.097 --> 01:39.850
Look, if you're not going

01:38.097 --> 01:39.850
to have the decency

01:39.892 --> 01:41.435
to choke on the fumes

01:39.892 --> 01:41.435
of your own bile,

01:41.476 --> 01:43.729
can you at least

01:41.476 --> 01:43.729
take your poison

01:41.476 --> 01:43.729
over to Aunt Susan's?

01:43.771 --> 01:46.356
Did she ask me to come?

01:43.771 --> 01:46.356
Did she call you?

01:43.771 --> 01:46.356
No.

01:46.398 --> 01:49.985
No, of course not.

01:46.398 --> 01:49.985
She only wants to see me suffer.

01:50.027 --> 01:52.153
Can you imagine

01:50.027 --> 01:52.153
how she's laughing at me,

01:52.195 --> 01:55.908
knowing that now I'm stuck

01:52.195 --> 01:55.908
with  you  as my favorite.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.035
Knock, knock.

01:58.077 --> 01:59.787
Lois, I need to borrow

01:58.077 --> 01:59.787
a coat hanger.

01:59.828 --> 02:02.081
I dropped my sandwich

01:59.828 --> 02:02.081
underneath my car seat.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.750
What's going on here?

02:04.792 --> 02:06.794
Lois is in labor,

02:04.792 --> 02:06.794
and Hal's not here.

02:07.628 --> 02:08.879
(whimpering)

02:08.921 --> 02:12.633
I have dreamed of this moment!

02:12.674 --> 02:13.884
Here's what

02:12.674 --> 02:13.884
we're going to do.

02:13.926 --> 02:15.385
I'm going to carry you

02:13.926 --> 02:15.385
in my arms to my van.

02:15.427 --> 02:19.180
I have one of the three

02:15.427 --> 02:19.180
original sirens from

02:15.427 --> 02:19.180
Starsky and Hutch.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.349
I can make that trip

02:19.222 --> 02:21.349
in seven minutes flat.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.184
You're talking crazy!

02:23.226 --> 02:25.437
There were only two sirens

02:23.226 --> 02:25.437
used in that entire series,

02:25.479 --> 02:27.106
and they're both

02:25.479 --> 02:27.106
in the Smithsonian.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.190
Au contraire.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.190
There were four sirens.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.233
(all talking at once)

02:30.275 --> 02:33.570
Oh, Hal, where are you?

02:33.612 --> 02:35.990
Well, let's go!

02:33.612 --> 02:35.990
Your mother's in labor!

02:36.031 --> 02:38.283
We just wasted 45 minutes

02:36.031 --> 02:38.283
in the security office.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.201
Just our luck--

02:38.325 --> 02:40.201
we get a rent-a-cop

02:40.243 --> 02:41.703
trying to make sergeant.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.665
I think he made you

02:41.745 --> 02:44.665
pee in that jar just

02:41.745 --> 02:44.665
because he could.

02:44.706 --> 02:47.042
You boys have  really  outdone

02:44.706 --> 02:47.042
yourselves this time.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.210
Now, I'm going to take your mom

02:47.084 --> 02:49.210
to the hospital,

02:49.252 --> 02:50.462
and I'm not going

02:49.252 --> 02:50.462
to hear one word

02:50.504 --> 02:52.380
out of any of you until we come

02:50.504 --> 02:52.380
back with the baby.

02:52.422 --> 02:55.467
(engine starts)

02:55.509 --> 02:57.552
(crashing)

02:58.929 --> 03:00.221
Okay, Dr. Kerr's going

02:58.929 --> 03:00.221
to meet you at the hospital.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.932
The guys are packing your bag,

03:01.974 --> 03:04.059
and Craig is cleaning out

03:01.974 --> 03:04.059
his car to make room for you.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.102
Two more trips

03:05.144 --> 03:06.145
and we're good to go.

03:06.185 --> 03:07.437
We're ready.

03:07.479 --> 03:11.108
What are you

03:07.479 --> 03:11.108
doing with all

03:07.479 --> 03:11.108
those suitcases?

03:11.150 --> 03:13.234
I told you she didn't need

03:11.150 --> 03:13.234
both sundresses.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.029
Hey, don't look at me.

03:15.070 --> 03:18.239
When I fly, I take one

03:15.070 --> 03:18.239
carry-on. That's it.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.240
(men arguing)

03:19.282 --> 03:23.037
I'm ready to go to the hospital.

03:19.282 --> 03:23.037
What?

03:23.078 --> 03:24.621
You're not going

03:23.078 --> 03:24.621
to the hospital.

03:24.663 --> 03:27.248
I'm not going?

03:24.663 --> 03:27.248
You're  not going.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.917
Oh, you want to go to

03:27.290 --> 03:28.917
the hospital so bad?

03:28.959 --> 03:30.711
I'll send you

03:28.959 --> 03:30.711
to the hospital.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.505
I'll send  you

03:30.752 --> 03:33.505
to the hospital!

03:33.547 --> 03:34.882
Nobody's going to the hospital!

03:36.341 --> 03:38.177
It's too late.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.388
Somebody call the paramedics.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.388
I'm having the baby here.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.143
Boys, call me a taxi,

03:46.185 --> 03:48.436
and then call Dr. Kerr, let him

03:46.185 --> 03:48.436
know your mom's in labor.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.521
He's in the book.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.480
Then call AAA...

03:50.522 --> 03:51.439
Dad, calm down.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.566
I will not calm down!

03:52.607 --> 03:54.526
(phone ringing)

03:54.568 --> 03:57.529
Hello. Hello?! Oh!

03:57.571 --> 03:58.488
Hello! Lois?

04:00.032 --> 04:01.533
What?! Honey!

04:01.575 --> 04:02.951
Sir, stop moving.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.452
MALCOLM AND REESE:

04:02.993 --> 04:04.452
What'd she say?!

04:04.494 --> 04:07.497
My wife's at home, and she's

04:04.494 --> 04:07.497
having our baby right now!

04:07.539 --> 04:09.290
I have to get home to her!

04:09.332 --> 04:10.584
She's having the

04:09.332 --> 04:10.584
baby at home?

04:10.625 --> 04:12.878
Sir, you're not going anywhere

04:10.625 --> 04:12.878
in the shape you're in.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.546
Give him ten milligrams

04:12.920 --> 04:14.546
of diazepam.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.590
HAL:

04:14.588 --> 04:16.590
Let me out of here.

04:16.631 --> 04:20.510
I'm fine! Wait. What is that?

04:20.552 --> 04:21.302
What-what is that?

04:21.344 --> 04:22.596
Wha-What does that do?

04:22.637 --> 04:24.264
Breathe in a bit.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.896
(groans)

04:30.938 --> 04:32.606
I've got to get home to her!

04:32.647 --> 04:35.483
Give him ten more.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.483
I want him immobilized.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.903
Why don't you boys

04:35.525 --> 04:37.903
come with me?

04:37.945 --> 04:39.738
We have all sorts

04:39.780 --> 04:42.282
of fun magazines

04:39.780 --> 04:42.282
in the waiting area.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.955
You like  Highlights?

04:44.868 --> 04:47.955
You like "Goofus and Gallant"?

04:47.996 --> 04:49.372
We don't want to read

04:47.996 --> 04:49.372
stupid magazines.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.582
Our mom is

04:49.414 --> 04:50.582
having a baby!

04:50.624 --> 04:53.334
I'm sure she's being

04:50.624 --> 04:53.334
very well taken care of,

04:53.376 --> 04:55.170
and so's your father,

04:55.212 --> 04:56.379
so there's nothing

04:55.212 --> 04:56.379
for you boys to do

04:56.421 --> 05:00.008
but relax and wait for someone

04:56.421 --> 05:00.008
to come and get you.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.552
But we have to do something.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.552
This is all our fault.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.512
You're obviously

05:02.594 --> 05:04.512
very upset young men,

05:04.554 --> 05:07.224
and frankly, I have no idea

05:04.554 --> 05:07.224
how to deal with you.

05:07.266 --> 05:08.516
That's why

05:07.266 --> 05:08.516
I'm not in pediatrics.

05:08.558 --> 05:12.229
Now, let's go

05:08.558 --> 05:12.229
into the waiting room

05:12.271 --> 05:13.730
like I told you.

05:13.772 --> 05:16.357
If you don't want

05:13.772 --> 05:16.357
to look at magazines,

05:16.399 --> 05:19.319
I'm sure there's a chair

05:16.399 --> 05:19.319
you can spin around in.

05:24.241 --> 05:25.575
My God, what does

05:24.241 --> 05:25.575
this woman weigh?!

05:25.617 --> 05:27.161
I'm losing my grip

05:25.617 --> 05:27.161
on her thigh!

05:27.202 --> 05:28.245
Let's get her

05:27.202 --> 05:28.245
to the bed!

05:28.287 --> 05:29.621
Let's get her in

05:28.287 --> 05:29.621
there! Let's go!

05:29.663 --> 05:31.206
Move it, move it,

05:29.663 --> 05:31.206
move it!

05:31.248 --> 05:33.625
All right, all right, all right!

05:31.248 --> 05:33.625
Count of three, count of three.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.627
MEN:

05:33.667 --> 05:35.627
One, two... three!

05:35.669 --> 05:37.296
(all grunting)

05:38.005 --> 05:39.256
That was like moving

05:39.298 --> 05:41.800
a concert grand.

05:39.298 --> 05:41.800
FRANCIS: Just relax, Mom.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.385
The paramedics will be here soon

05:41.842 --> 05:44.385
and they'll know what to do.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.471
Don't worry, Lois,

05:44.427 --> 05:46.471
I just Googled the word "baby."

05:46.513 --> 05:49.432
Here we go. 28 million matches--

05:46.513 --> 05:49.432
there ought to be

05:49.474 --> 05:51.310
something useful in there.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.310
Craig, get off

05:49.474 --> 05:51.310
that thing.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.394
We don't need it.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.394
Trey's a doctor.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.190
Oh, no, Lois, I'm a dentist.

05:56.231 --> 05:58.275
But you have medical training,

05:56.231 --> 05:58.275
don't you?

05:58.317 --> 05:59.651
Yes, but I took up dentistry

05:59.693 --> 06:02.696
specifically because...

05:59.693 --> 06:02.696
well, that area down there,

06:02.737 --> 06:06.033
whe-when I look at it,

06:02.737 --> 06:06.033
I get giggly.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.202
I just do...

06:08.243 --> 06:10.411
since high school.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.122
Oh, for God's sakes.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.916
I doubt I'm the only one.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.916
(doorbell rings)

06:14.958 --> 06:17.669
The paramedics are... oh.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.669
Hi, is Malcolm home?

06:17.711 --> 06:20.421
No, and we're in...

06:17.711 --> 06:20.421
I just need to use his notes

06:17.711 --> 06:20.421
for my biochem homework.

06:20.463 --> 06:23.424
This really isn't

06:20.463 --> 06:23.424
a good time.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.093
You don't say hello

06:23.466 --> 06:25.093
to your own grandmother?

06:25.135 --> 06:28.889
I'm not Malcolm.

06:25.135 --> 06:28.889
We've been through

06:25.135 --> 06:28.889
this before.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.432
(shouting):

06:28.930 --> 06:31.432
Oh, God, the baby

06:28.930 --> 06:31.432
is pressing down

06:31.474 --> 06:33.018
so hard on my cervix!

06:33.060 --> 06:35.729
Well, good, looks

06:33.060 --> 06:35.729
like everything's

06:33.060 --> 06:35.729
under control here.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.689
Piama and I are

06:35.770 --> 06:37.689
going to head out

06:37.731 --> 06:39.440
back to the ranch.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.151
What are you talking about?

06:41.193 --> 06:42.903
Nothing!

06:41.193 --> 06:42.903
You think I'm running away?

06:42.944 --> 06:45.488
You think being here

06:42.944 --> 06:45.488
when my own mother gives birth

06:45.530 --> 06:47.949
is-is making me

06:45.530 --> 06:47.949
so intensely uncomfortable

06:47.991 --> 06:50.077
I've made up a fake excuse

06:47.991 --> 06:50.077
to leave?

06:50.118 --> 06:52.120
That is not even

06:50.118 --> 06:52.120
a tiny bit true.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.539
CRAIG:

06:52.162 --> 06:54.539
Okay, clothes for babies,

06:52.162 --> 06:54.539
names for babies,

06:54.581 --> 06:57.458
truck drivers dressed like...

06:54.581 --> 06:57.458
ew.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.710
Excuse me, can

06:57.500 --> 06:58.710
somebody help me

06:58.752 --> 07:00.087
find Malcolm's

06:58.752 --> 07:00.087
biochem notes?

07:00.128 --> 07:01.296
I need them

07:01.338 --> 07:02.130
to do my assignment.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.840
Get out of here, Lloyd!

07:03.882 --> 07:06.843
I'm in labor!

07:03.882 --> 07:06.843
I'm about to give birth!

07:06.885 --> 07:10.347
It's a really important

07:06.885 --> 07:10.347
assignment.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.517
We are the worst kids

07:12.599 --> 07:14.517
in the world.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.311
Mom was right.

07:16.353 --> 07:19.731
We really  are  evil little trolls

07:16.353 --> 07:19.731
who have absolutely

07:19.773 --> 07:21.482
no consideration

07:19.773 --> 07:21.482
for anything

07:21.524 --> 07:22.901
but ourselves,

07:22.943 --> 07:25.404
and destroy everything

07:22.943 --> 07:25.404
we come in contact with,

07:25.445 --> 07:28.489
and we're lucky if we don't

07:25.445 --> 07:28.489
end up in prison or dead.

07:28.531 --> 07:29.908
Here's what we're going to do.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.492
There's a class that starts here

07:31.534 --> 07:32.911
in ten minutes.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.871
It's all about how to be parents

07:32.953 --> 07:34.871
to newborn babies.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.497
We're going to take it.

07:36.539 --> 07:37.498
What are you talking about?

07:37.540 --> 07:38.917
We're going to learn

07:37.540 --> 07:38.917
how to help out.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.169
We're going to learn

07:38.959 --> 07:41.169
how to be good for once.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.088
All right!

07:41.211 --> 07:43.088
Yeah, this baby's

07:41.211 --> 07:43.088
not going to get

07:43.130 --> 07:44.505
dropped on its head

07:43.130 --> 07:44.505
all the time.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.007
Yeah!

07:46.049 --> 07:47.050
What?

07:48.551 --> 07:49.803
Take a deep breath,

07:48.551 --> 07:49.803
and blow it out

07:49.844 --> 07:51.179
like you're blowing out

07:49.844 --> 07:51.179
a candle.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.180
(puffing)

07:52.222 --> 07:54.933
(puffing)

07:54.975 --> 07:57.518
Oh!

07:57.560 --> 07:58.937
Oh!

07:57.560 --> 07:58.937
Oh, my God!

07:58.979 --> 08:01.148
I thought my fingers

07:58.979 --> 08:01.148
were going to explode!

08:01.189 --> 08:03.024
Way to breathe through it.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.024
CRAIG:

08:01.189 --> 08:03.024
Hey, hey,

08:03.066 --> 08:05.026
I found something!

08:05.068 --> 08:07.237
There's been a slight increase

08:05.068 --> 08:07.237
in the incidence

08:07.279 --> 08:10.157
of babies born with a tail.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.826
I wonder if that makes it easier

08:10.198 --> 08:12.826
to tell when they're happy?

08:12.867 --> 08:14.828
Where the hell

08:12.867 --> 08:14.828
are those paramedics?

08:14.869 --> 08:16.163
They'll be here

08:14.869 --> 08:16.163
any second.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.538
Steve called them

08:17.580 --> 08:19.499
ten minutes ago.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.586
Yeah, that's right.

08:23.628 --> 08:26.506
That's what I did

08:23.628 --> 08:26.506
ten minutes ago.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.593
So, when did you get

08:28.633 --> 08:30.593
this wallpaper?

08:30.635 --> 08:32.553
(men chatting)

08:32.595 --> 08:33.554
So, anyway,

08:33.596 --> 08:34.806
we just feel awful,

08:34.848 --> 08:37.225
and that's why we really

08:34.848 --> 08:37.225
want to take this class.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.060
Oh, my God,

08:37.267 --> 08:39.060
you should feel awful.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.728
You're horrible children.

08:40.770 --> 08:41.646
That's our point.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.398
Well, I suppose

08:43.440 --> 08:46.651
everyone deserves

08:43.440 --> 08:46.651
another chance.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.237
All right, you can

08:46.693 --> 08:49.237
take the class.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.571
Thank you.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.571
Ah, we're in.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.571
Yes!

08:50.613 --> 08:52.199
When your milk duct is blocked,

08:52.240 --> 08:53.367
it's called mastitis.

08:53.408 --> 08:55.285
It's important

08:53.408 --> 08:55.285
that you let your baby

08:55.327 --> 08:57.578
suck the obstruction

08:55.327 --> 08:57.578
out of the breast,

08:57.620 --> 08:59.747
and don't be alarmed

08:57.620 --> 08:59.747
if the baby then vomits up

08:59.789 --> 09:02.000
a cottage cheese-type substance.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.584
Now, join me over here...

09:03.626 --> 09:07.588
Like I needed another reason

09:03.626 --> 09:07.588
to hate cottage cheese.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.050
I've been kind

09:07.630 --> 09:10.050
of zoning in

09:07.630 --> 09:10.050
and out here,

09:10.091 --> 09:12.511
but did she just

09:10.091 --> 09:12.511
say milk comes out

09:10.091 --> 09:12.511
of those things?

09:12.552 --> 09:15.305
Reese, that's what

09:12.552 --> 09:15.305
they're for.

09:15.347 --> 09:16.639
My God!

09:16.681 --> 09:19.893
Women are the cows of people!

09:19.934 --> 09:22.603
(whimpers)

09:22.645 --> 09:25.606
Oh!

09:25.648 --> 09:27.692
I'm coming, Lois.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.445
(grunting)

09:36.910 --> 09:38.619
(grunts)

09:38.661 --> 09:41.081
I'm coming, Lois!

09:41.122 --> 09:43.083
I'm coming,

09:41.122 --> 09:43.083
Lois!

09:45.960 --> 09:48.796
(grunting)

09:48.838 --> 09:52.133
I'm coming, Lois!

09:53.676 --> 09:58.639
I'm coming, Lois!

09:53.676 --> 09:58.639
I'm coming!

09:58.681 --> 10:00.434
I'm coming, Lois!

10:00.475 --> 10:01.642
(screeching):

10:00.475 --> 10:01.642
I'm coming!

10:01.684 --> 10:05.313
I'm coming, Lois!

10:01.684 --> 10:05.313
I'm coming!

10:05.355 --> 10:08.191
I'm c...

10:19.702 --> 10:22.663
(whispers):

10:19.702 --> 10:22.663
I'm coming...

10:22.705 --> 10:25.875
Lois.

10:31.214 --> 10:32.924
Here, I brought some towels

10:32.966 --> 10:33.883
to put under

10:32.966 --> 10:33.883
your knees.

10:33.925 --> 10:34.884
Oh, Piama,

10:34.926 --> 10:35.885
don't use the good towels.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.929
IDA: What does she

10:35.927 --> 10:37.929
know about towels?

10:37.971 --> 10:42.559
Her people dried themselves off

10:37.971 --> 10:42.559
by throwing dirt on their backs.

10:43.560 --> 10:44.685
Thank you, Piama.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.020
Thank you very much.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.565
I'm sure

10:48.607 --> 10:51.734
the paramedics will come

10:48.607 --> 10:51.734
get you very soon,

10:51.776 --> 10:53.403
and before they do,

10:53.445 --> 10:55.572
there's something

10:53.445 --> 10:55.572
I want you to know.

10:56.448 --> 10:59.742
Your father had

10:56.448 --> 10:59.742
a second family.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.077
What?!

11:01.119 --> 11:03.955
This slutty cocktail

11:01.119 --> 11:03.955
waitress in Manitoba.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.706
She was nothing

11:03.997 --> 11:05.706
but a pig,

11:05.748 --> 11:08.709
and the children that

11:05.748 --> 11:08.709
came out of her...

11:08.751 --> 11:10.711
Why are you

11:08.751 --> 11:10.711
telling me this now?

11:10.753 --> 11:11.712
In case you die,

11:11.754 --> 11:13.423
I don't want you

11:11.754 --> 11:13.423
thinking of him

11:13.465 --> 11:14.508
as a decent man,

11:14.549 --> 11:16.301
but don't tell your sister.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.637
Let her stew

11:16.343 --> 11:18.637
in her own ignorance.

11:18.677 --> 11:21.598
I only tell this

11:18.677 --> 11:21.598
to my favorite.

11:21.640 --> 11:22.849
(loud hammering)

11:23.850 --> 11:25.226
What are you doing?

11:25.268 --> 11:26.769
Building calms me down, okay?

11:26.811 --> 11:28.813
We're all trying to find

11:26.811 --> 11:28.813
ways to cope with this.

11:28.855 --> 11:31.732
Yes, Francis, I'm trying

11:28.855 --> 11:31.732
to cope with this pregnancy

11:31.774 --> 11:33.818
by giving birth!

11:33.860 --> 11:36.530
Excuse me. I'm

11:33.860 --> 11:36.530
working quietly.

11:36.571 --> 11:37.656
I'd appreciate it

11:37.696 --> 11:40.283
if  you  could work

11:37.696 --> 11:40.283
quietly, too.

11:42.243 --> 11:44.162
Got to get out...

11:44.204 --> 11:45.746
I gotta get out.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.541
I gotta get out.

11:47.582 --> 11:48.583
H-Hey!

11:48.625 --> 11:49.543
How's it going?

11:49.584 --> 11:50.751
You gotta get me

11:49.584 --> 11:50.751
out of here.

11:50.793 --> 11:51.836
I don't belong in here.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.672
I have to get home.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.256
It's okay, little fellow.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.256
You'll be fine...

11:55.298 --> 11:58.426
as long as someone claims you

11:55.298 --> 11:58.426
in the next six hours.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.053
Six hours?

11:58.468 --> 12:00.053
What happens then?

12:00.094 --> 12:02.763
Wait! What happens then?!

12:02.805 --> 12:04.265
Oh, boys!

12:04.307 --> 12:05.766
Boys!

12:05.808 --> 12:06.934
Over here.

12:05.808 --> 12:06.934
Pick me, pick me.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.144
Wow, look at this guy.

12:08.186 --> 12:09.770
Yeah!

12:09.812 --> 12:11.730
That is the ugliest dog

12:09.812 --> 12:11.730
I've ever seen.

12:12.524 --> 12:13.858
What did he roll in?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.360
I'm gonna be sick.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.944
Oh, look at this one.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.779
No! No, please come back.

12:18.821 --> 12:19.822
Please, please, please!

12:19.864 --> 12:22.741
Can someone shut

12:19.864 --> 12:22.741
this yappy one up?

12:23.742 --> 12:25.078
That's right, Dewey.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.872
Come back to Daddy.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.872
Pick Daddy.

12:27.914 --> 12:31.167
Can we take this one's collar

12:27.914 --> 12:31.167
and put it on the good one?

12:31.209 --> 12:33.712
Collar?

12:33.752 --> 12:34.795
What?

12:34.837 --> 12:36.715
No! No!

12:36.755 --> 12:38.966
(howling):

12:36.755 --> 12:38.966
No!

12:39.008 --> 12:41.010
No! No! No!

12:41.052 --> 12:42.929
(barking)

13:01.864 --> 13:04.242
My biggest fear...

13:01.864 --> 13:04.242
is that I won't be

13:04.284 --> 13:05.702
a good big brother.

13:05.744 --> 13:06.827
Babies are born stupid

13:06.869 --> 13:08.829
and they're

13:06.869 --> 13:08.829
really counting on you.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.540
They'll touch stuff

13:08.871 --> 13:10.540
they shouldn't.

13:10.582 --> 13:12.417
They'll eat anything.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.712
I'd say half of all our Legos

13:12.459 --> 13:15.712
have been through this kid.

13:15.754 --> 13:16.795
Probably more.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.092
Can I get a new baby?

13:21.968 --> 13:23.720
(man screaming)

13:23.762 --> 13:24.845
Lois, Let go!

13:24.887 --> 13:26.847
Or at least

13:24.887 --> 13:26.847
grab his hand!

13:26.889 --> 13:28.683
They say that childbirth

13:28.725 --> 13:32.479
is the most painful thing

13:28.725 --> 13:32.479
a person can go through.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.523
With a little light pancake,

13:32.520 --> 13:35.523
you could pass.

13:35.565 --> 13:39.778
You don't have to hang out

13:35.565 --> 13:39.778
with the other ones, you know.

13:40.737 --> 13:41.862
Okay, you know what?

13:41.904 --> 13:43.114
See, here's the thing...

13:43.156 --> 13:45.283
Lady...

13:43.156 --> 13:45.283
we're better than you.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.868
Every one of us in every way.

13:47.910 --> 13:48.869
I'm smarter than you,

13:48.911 --> 13:51.914
more educated, and

13:48.911 --> 13:51.914
I contribute more to society.

13:51.956 --> 13:52.873
I have a family

13:52.915 --> 13:53.916
that loves me.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.460
I live in a big house,

13:55.502 --> 13:57.796
drive a nice car

13:55.502 --> 13:57.796
and make more money in a year

13:57.836 --> 13:59.880
than you've probably made

13:57.836 --> 13:59.880
your whole lifetime.

13:59.922 --> 14:03.968
Big deal.

13:59.922 --> 14:03.968
So you're a drug dealer.

14:05.595 --> 14:06.887
Booga-booga!

14:06.929 --> 14:07.888
(shrieks)

14:07.930 --> 14:09.056
LOIS:

14:07.930 --> 14:09.056
Hal, where are you?

14:09.098 --> 14:10.975
Put the ice on it.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.769
The paramedics'll

14:11.017 --> 14:12.769
be here any minute,

14:12.811 --> 14:13.894
so just hang on.

14:13.936 --> 14:14.937
I can't hang on.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.564
It doesn't work

14:14.979 --> 14:16.564
like that.

14:16.606 --> 14:17.982
This baby is coming now.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.900
Lois, you don't want

14:18.024 --> 14:19.900
to push until you're

14:19.942 --> 14:22.278
at least ten

14:19.942 --> 14:22.278
centimeters dilated.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.405
Well, take a look if you want.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.616
Uh... I-I...

14:26.658 --> 14:29.160
I'd be happy to

14:26.658 --> 14:29.160
look in your mouth.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.996
Do you know those animals are

14:29.202 --> 14:31.996
in your backyard right now

14:32.038 --> 14:34.957
pacing back and forth

14:32.038 --> 14:34.957
like it's Africa?

14:34.999 --> 14:36.835
When this is my room,

14:36.876 --> 14:40.213
they don't come

14:36.876 --> 14:40.213
within 20 feet of the door.

14:40.254 --> 14:42.757
Oh, I can't believe she's

14:40.254 --> 14:42.757
here. I can't believe

14:42.799 --> 14:45.218
my sister picked now

14:42.799 --> 14:45.218
to have a fight with her.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.761
I can't believe

14:45.259 --> 14:46.761
I'm going to have

14:46.803 --> 14:47.846
to move into

14:46.803 --> 14:47.846
the boys' room.

14:47.887 --> 14:48.929
Calm down.

14:48.971 --> 14:49.930
Does your sister know

14:49.972 --> 14:51.932
your mom is dying?

14:51.974 --> 14:53.100
What are you

14:51.974 --> 14:53.100
talking about?

14:53.142 --> 14:55.520
Does your sister know your

14:53.142 --> 14:55.520
mother has a fatal disease

14:55.562 --> 14:56.604
that she's been hiding

14:56.646 --> 14:58.231
and this might be

14:56.646 --> 14:58.231
her last chance

14:58.272 --> 15:00.400
to make peace?

15:00.441 --> 15:02.943
With her mother.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.070
Who's dying.

15:06.698 --> 15:07.240
Wipe.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.616
Cream.

15:08.658 --> 15:09.701
Ready.

15:10.368 --> 15:11.952
Done!

15:10.368 --> 15:11.952
ALL:

15:10.368 --> 15:11.952
Yeah!

15:11.994 --> 15:12.871
Number one.

15:12.912 --> 15:13.954
In your face!

15:13.996 --> 15:14.955
We're just learning

15:14.997 --> 15:16.666
how to take care

15:14.997 --> 15:16.666
of our babies.

15:16.708 --> 15:17.958
That's loser talk.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.545
We're gonna be

15:18.000 --> 15:20.545
the best big brothers ever.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.381
We aced Diaper and we

15:20.587 --> 15:23.381
totally owned Tub Time.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.549
I'm so glad I memorized

15:24.591 --> 15:26.008
all the common

15:24.591 --> 15:26.008
household chemicals

15:26.050 --> 15:27.886
that can be poisonous

15:26.050 --> 15:27.886
to the baby.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.264
You know, all this stuff

15:27.927 --> 15:31.264
parents have to do...

15:31.305 --> 15:33.558
all the feedings

15:31.305 --> 15:33.558
and bathings

15:33.600 --> 15:34.684
and diaperings

15:34.726 --> 15:36.770
and safety stuff

15:34.726 --> 15:36.770
and scheduling--

15:36.811 --> 15:38.104
just made me realize.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.065
Mom never did any of this.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.443
There's a bottle of this

15:41.107 --> 15:43.443
on our headboard.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.528
No wonder we turned out

15:43.484 --> 15:45.528
the way we did.

15:46.613 --> 15:47.988
(groaning)

15:48.030 --> 15:49.699
It's six months,

15:48.030 --> 15:49.699
maybe a year.

15:49.741 --> 15:50.991
I'm gonna need

15:49.741 --> 15:50.991
that computer.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.202
Not today, squirt.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.202
Lois is about to have a baby,

15:53.244 --> 15:55.371
and I'm in charge of research.

15:55.413 --> 15:57.998
She's hot.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.877
I can't work with someone

15:58.040 --> 16:00.877
looking over my shoulder.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.002
Well, I'll see

16:00.919 --> 16:02.002
if I can find her.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.004
Mother! Telephone!

16:04.046 --> 16:07.884
Is the border station

16:04.046 --> 16:07.884
going to return my rifle?

16:07.926 --> 16:09.260
Hello?

16:11.763 --> 16:12.972
Yes?

16:14.223 --> 16:15.934
Oh, I'm glad

16:14.223 --> 16:15.934
to hear you say that.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.018
No, I'm fine.

16:18.060 --> 16:21.021
I'm here with you-know-who,

16:18.060 --> 16:21.021
and she's doing...

16:21.063 --> 16:22.231
you-know-what.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.734
Again. Yeah.

16:24.776 --> 16:28.529
(laughing)

16:28.571 --> 16:30.907
(groaning)

16:33.075 --> 16:34.410
Where are the paramedics?

16:34.452 --> 16:36.412
These contractions

16:34.452 --> 16:36.412
are too close to time.

16:36.454 --> 16:39.081
Francis, this baby's going

16:36.454 --> 16:39.081
to be born any minute.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.041
I want you to do

16:39.123 --> 16:41.041
something for me.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.418
What do you want me to do?

16:42.460 --> 16:44.128
I want you to deliver the baby.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.129
What?

16:45.171 --> 16:46.297
No.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.548
You can do it.

16:47.590 --> 16:48.758
You've done it

16:47.590 --> 16:48.758
before.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.844
You deliver barn

16:48.800 --> 16:50.844
animals all the time.

16:50.885 --> 16:52.094
You're not a

16:50.885 --> 16:52.094
barn animal.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.262
Francis, your father isn't here;

16:53.304 --> 16:55.055
you're the only person I trust.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.724
You don't even like me.

16:56.766 --> 16:59.059
But I love you,

16:56.766 --> 16:59.059
which is why

16:59.101 --> 17:01.061
you're going

16:59.101 --> 17:01.061
to do this.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.105
No! You can't make me!

17:03.147 --> 17:05.065
Francis, your mother

17:03.147 --> 17:05.065
is asking for your help.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.317
LOIS:

17:05.107 --> 17:06.317
Francis.

17:06.359 --> 17:09.069
You can do this.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.112
You know that you can.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.740
Now, you're going

17:10.154 --> 17:12.740
to put your hands

17:12.782 --> 17:14.868
inside of Mommy

17:12.782 --> 17:14.868
and take out

17:14.909 --> 17:16.035
this baby!

17:22.625 --> 17:25.085
Lois.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.338
Oh, Lois.

17:27.380 --> 17:32.134
I finally found you.

17:32.969 --> 17:35.722
Oh, I missed the baby.

17:35.763 --> 17:36.973
It's okay.

17:37.015 --> 17:39.600
The baby is fine, Hal.

17:39.642 --> 17:42.061
Honey, I'm the worst husband

17:39.642 --> 17:42.061
in the world.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.525
I can't believe

17:45.189 --> 17:47.525
how terrible I am.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.943
Oh...

17:53.239 --> 17:55.533
I can't believe I made you

17:53.239 --> 17:55.533
go through this alone.

17:56.617 --> 17:59.704
I wish I could have been there.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.122
You were there, Hal.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.124
I was?

18:04.166 --> 18:06.377
We're a part of each other.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.129
Wherever I go, you're there.

18:09.171 --> 18:12.132
You are always with me.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.760
I love you.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.388
(monitor beeping rapidly)

18:19.766 --> 18:21.809
(both moaning)

18:29.984 --> 18:32.779
Oh, my God, what

18:29.984 --> 18:32.779
is that man doing?

18:32.820 --> 18:33.654
What?

18:33.696 --> 18:36.323
Get that sicko off of her.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.785
What? Lois? Are you...?

18:38.826 --> 18:41.161
Someone call the police.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.663
MALCOLM:

18:41.203 --> 18:42.663
Dad!

18:45.083 --> 18:46.166
Oh, my God!

18:46.208 --> 18:47.376
What the hell

18:46.208 --> 18:47.376
are you doing?

18:50.212 --> 18:51.422
(shrieks)

18:51.464 --> 18:53.424
(Lois groans)

18:54.300 --> 18:55.217
Can you see the head?

18:55.259 --> 18:56.636
Not yet.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.471
You're not even looking.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.180
Is it starting

18:58.512 --> 19:00.180
to crown?

19:00.222 --> 19:02.182
Uh... yes.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.183
That's good. That's good.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.184
God, I can't believe

19:04.226 --> 19:06.062
I'm looking at... this.

19:06.104 --> 19:07.814
I'm going to die.

19:07.855 --> 19:11.692
If the head is completely

19:07.855 --> 19:11.692
crowning, it's okay to push.

19:11.734 --> 19:14.112
(moaning)

19:14.153 --> 19:18.116
If anyone calls,

19:14.153 --> 19:18.116
I'll be at your sister's.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.241
(moaning)

19:19.283 --> 19:22.161
No, don't worry.

19:19.283 --> 19:22.161
I'll let myself out.

19:23.621 --> 19:25.247
Come on, Lois. Come on.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.126
Ew!

19:28.960 --> 19:30.711
Ew!

19:31.504 --> 19:34.132
Ew!

19:36.550 --> 19:38.218
(baby crying)

19:36.550 --> 19:38.218
Was that the...?

19:38.260 --> 19:41.014
(gasps)

19:41.055 --> 19:43.516
I got it. I got it.

19:43.557 --> 19:44.809
Oh, my God.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.226
I got it!

19:46.268 --> 19:47.227
Yes!

19:48.896 --> 19:49.522
It's here.

19:51.899 --> 19:53.359
Put it on her chest.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.321
Oh.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.323
Hi, baby.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.159
Hi.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.537
(crying)

20:05.872 --> 20:07.331
Hi, baby.

20:07.373 --> 20:11.544
Oh, thank you, Francis.

20:11.585 --> 20:15.297
This is the nicest thing

20:11.585 --> 20:15.297
you've ever done for me.

20:15.339 --> 20:17.008
I am so proud of you.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.347
You can go vomit now.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.475
ABE:

20:24.974 --> 20:26.475
Way to go.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.268
Here he comes.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.268
There he is.

20:28.310 --> 20:32.148
(Francis gags, others murmur)

20:32.190 --> 20:33.273
Well, is it

20:33.315 --> 20:35.151
a boy or a girl?

20:35.193 --> 20:36.903
It's a beautiful,

20:35.193 --> 20:36.903
healthy baby...

20:36.944 --> 20:38.278
(siren blares)

20:38.320 --> 20:41.782
ALL:

20:38.320 --> 20:41.782
Aw...

20:41.824 --> 20:43.283
I knew it!

20:43.325 --> 20:44.744
Oh, that's all right.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.286
Hi there.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.873
I'm your mommy.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.249
Okay, so who's having the baby?

20:51.792 --> 20:56.130
I told you we shouldn't

20:51.792 --> 20:56.130
have stopped for coffee.

20:56.172 --> 20:57.339
(vibrating lips)

20:57.381 --> 20:59.299
Oh, I've forgotten

20:57.381 --> 20:59.299
how small they are.

20:59.341 --> 21:02.178
I forgot

20:59.341 --> 21:02.178
how good they smell.

21:02.220 --> 21:03.221
LOIS:

21:02.220 --> 21:03.221
Yeah.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.388
Okay, hand it over.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.765
MALCOLM:

21:04.430 --> 21:05.765
It's 5:30.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.474
It's time for the baby's

21:05.806 --> 21:07.474
sponge bath.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.309
Look how full

21:07.516 --> 21:09.309
this diaper is.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.645
When was the last time

21:09.351 --> 21:11.645
you changed it?

21:12.855 --> 21:14.565
Have you at least come up

21:12.855 --> 21:14.565
with a name yet?

21:14.607 --> 21:18.027
Yes. Jamie.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.363
It fits.

21:24.242 --> 21:26.786
We'll come back

21:24.242 --> 21:26.786
when your udders are ready.
