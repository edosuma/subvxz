- I am.

Could I talk to your son for a bit?

He's been through a lot
of bad things lately,

00:08.774 --> 00:10.374

- Yeah, they let him go.</i>

00:18.083 --> 00:19.517
But they're gonna make him go back

00:19.618 --> 00:21.485

private place, Pineview.

00:21.587 --> 00:22.753
Yeah, no, I know. Yeah.

00:22.855 --> 00:24.155
I don't have any insurance,

00:24.256 --> 00:26.724
so I thought maybe you could marry me.

not gonna marry you.
