(Michael)
'Zack..'

00:11.833 --> 00:12.917
What do we got?

00:13.000 --> 00:16.250
Another 200 refugees
in from sector 29.

00:16.333 --> 00:17.708
We got five
more ships due in

00:17.792 --> 00:19.292
by the end of the day.

00:19.375 --> 00:20.792
Now we're turning
the healthy ones around

00:20.875 --> 00:22.208
as fast as we can
and sending them

00:22.292 --> 00:24.167
on to the Narn homeworld..

00:24.250 --> 00:27.167
But the injured, they're filling
up every bed in Medlab.

00:27.250 --> 00:29.750
Now, if we could even just ship
out some of the injured--

00:29.833 --> 00:31.958
Ah, no can do.
Captain's orders.

00:32.042 --> 00:33.708
They don't leave
until they're fit to travel.

00:33.792 --> 00:36.417
Chief, I understand
how he feels.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.208
You see them come through here
you can't help

00:38.292 --> 00:41.417
but feel for them,
but we're swamped.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.583
Now, can't you
at least talk to him?

00:50.583 --> 00:53.125
[instrumental music]

01:00.833 --> 01:02.333
Mr. Morden.

01:02.417 --> 01:03.583
Vir.

01:03.667 --> 01:05.625
I was expecting
Ambassador Mollari.

01:05.708 --> 01:07.625
Uh, he was recalled
to Centauri Prime

01:07.708 --> 01:09.625
for consultations
about the war effort.

01:09.708 --> 01:12.250
And how is your war going?

01:12.333 --> 01:13.458
Why do you ask me questions

01:13.542 --> 01:15.292
when you already
know the answers?

01:15.375 --> 01:16.875
[chuckles]

01:16.958 --> 01:18.667
Just making conversation.

01:19.875 --> 01:20.958
Here. Sit.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.750
Sit.

01:31.875 --> 01:33.583
You don't like me,
do you, Vir?

01:34.625 --> 01:37.042
I find this surprising.

01:37.125 --> 01:38.583
After all, my associates
and I are doing

01:38.667 --> 01:40.208
everything we can
to help your people

01:40.292 --> 01:42.333
reclaim their place
in the galaxy.

01:43.417 --> 01:45.958
I should think
you'd be grateful.

01:46.042 --> 01:47.958
Is there a reason
you sent for me?

01:50.083 --> 01:53.208
I sent for Ambassador Mollari

01:53.292 --> 01:56.125
but you're here, he's not,
and it can wait.

01:56.208 --> 01:58.792
'If restoring the Centauri
republic means nothing to you'

01:58.875 --> 02:00.083
what does?

02:00.792 --> 02:02.917
What do you want?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.708
I'd like to live
just long enough

02:04.792 --> 02:06.292
to be there when see them
cut off your head

02:06.375 --> 02:08.458
and stick it on a pike
as a warning

02:08.542 --> 02:10.875
to the next ten generations
that some favors

02:10.958 --> 02:12.667
come with too high a price.

02:12.750 --> 02:14.750
I want to look up into
your lifeless eyes

02:14.833 --> 02:16.750
and wave like this.

02:18.292 --> 02:19.333
Can you and your associates

02:19.417 --> 02:21.292
arrange that for me, Mr. Morden?

02:25.292 --> 02:29.375
Here's the information
Ambassador Mollari asked for.

02:29.458 --> 02:31.458
Give it to him when he arrives.

02:34.542 --> 02:35.875
You can go now.

02:42.125 --> 02:43.750
- Mr. Morden.
- Hmm?

02:51.500 --> 02:53.250
Captain, you got a minute?

02:53.333 --> 02:54.792
(John)
'Yeah. Sure. What's up?'

02:54.875 --> 02:57.417
Ah, it's the Narn refugee
situation again.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.167
Look you got to give me
some discretionary power--

02:59.250 --> 03:01.625
I know, I know, I know.
I thought we could handle it

03:01.708 --> 03:04.917
but there are
so many coming through.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.292
I mean, it's hard, Michael.
They're a proud people.

03:07.375 --> 03:10.833
To see them humbled
like this is..

03:12.958 --> 03:14.000
Alright.

03:14.083 --> 03:15.333
Tell Franklin to have his people

03:15.417 --> 03:17.125
separate out the injured.

03:17.208 --> 03:19.250
Light cases
get first aid only

03:19.333 --> 03:21.625
then load them
on the first ship out.

03:21.708 --> 03:23.625
Critical cases
get taken to Medlab

03:23.708 --> 03:25.875
on a priority basis.

03:25.958 --> 03:27.250
And the dying?

03:29.292 --> 03:30.625
Medlab.

03:30.708 --> 03:32.958
Earth Central will say
this is a waste of resources.

03:33.042 --> 03:34.875
I won't have people
dying alone cold and alone

03:34.958 --> 03:36.583
on the docking bay floor.

03:37.583 --> 03:40.250
- Understood.
- Yeah.

03:40.333 --> 03:42.500
The, uh, Icarus?

03:42.583 --> 03:43.792
'Yes, it was a science vessel'

03:43.875 --> 03:46.542
my wife was on
when she passed away.

03:46.625 --> 03:48.125
I'd been putting off

03:48.208 --> 03:49.667
sorting through
the last of her stuff

03:49.750 --> 03:54.042
you know, what to keep,
what to throw away.

03:54.125 --> 03:57.083
Before she left she sent me
a breakdown of the mission..

03:57.167 --> 03:58.583
Crew, personnel..

03:59.750 --> 04:02.333
When they were
supposed to come back.

04:02.417 --> 04:04.083
I read about this
when it happened.

04:05.208 --> 04:07.667
I'm sorry.

04:07.750 --> 04:09.167
- Mind if I take a look?
- Yeah.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.667
There's nothing
personal in it.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.708
[electronic beeping]

04:12.792 --> 04:15.792
[chuckles]
I mean, she didn't know
anybody else on board.

04:16.917 --> 04:18.542
(Michael)
'Whoa. Wait a second.'

04:20.500 --> 04:23.000
I know this guy.
I've-I've seen him around.

04:23.083 --> 04:24.500
It's impossible,
he was on the Icarus

04:24.583 --> 04:25.833
when it exploded.
Same as Anna.

04:25.917 --> 04:29.292
No, no, Captain. I know
what I'm talking about.

04:29.375 --> 04:31.208
I've seen him. He's alive.

04:36.917 --> 04:42.167
(male narrator)
The Babylon project was
our last, best hope for peace.

04:42.250 --> 04:45.125
A self-contained world
five miles long

04:45.208 --> 04:47.333
located in neutral territory.

04:50.792 --> 04:52.917
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

04:53.000 --> 04:56.542
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens.

04:56.625 --> 05:02.000
A shining beacon in space,
all alone in the night.

05:02.083 --> 05:05.458
It was the dawn of
the third age of mankind

05:05.542 --> 05:09.833
the year the great war
came upon us all.

05:09.917 --> 05:13.875
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

05:13.958 --> 05:16.042
The year is 2259.

05:16.125 --> 05:19.208
The name of the place
is "Babylon 5."

05:22.417 --> 05:24.458
[theme music]

05:42.875 --> 05:44.708
[music continues]

06:05.833 --> 06:08.458
That's him, alright.
I never forget a face.

06:08.542 --> 06:11.417
Morden. Same ID
as on the Icarus.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.917
He's supposed to be dead.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.250
Why didn't the security
net catch him?

06:16.333 --> 06:17.458
Captain, come on.

06:17.542 --> 06:18.875
We don't get every
death certificate

06:18.958 --> 06:21.083
from every earth alliance
ship and colony.

06:21.167 --> 06:22.625
Now if he'd broken
any station rules

06:22.708 --> 06:24.833
or got into any fights,
we would have run a full check.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.458
And this would have come out.

06:26.542 --> 06:29.083
But he hasn't done anything
to attract attention.

06:29.167 --> 06:30.417
When was he last here?

06:32.250 --> 06:35.833
Customs log shows he arrived
here two days ago.

06:35.917 --> 06:37.208
Date of departure..

06:38.542 --> 06:40.083
He's still here.

06:44.125 --> 06:46.417
Find him. Bring him here.

06:46.500 --> 06:49.458
I don't care if you have
to seal off the whole station.

06:49.542 --> 06:50.875
I want him found.

06:52.042 --> 06:53.875
I want to know
what he's doing here.

06:55.208 --> 06:56.292
And why he's alive

06:56.375 --> 06:58.125
when my wife and everyone else

06:58.208 --> 07:01.417
who was on board
the Icarus with him is dead.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.208
[doorbell rings]

07:05.292 --> 07:06.583
Yes?

07:08.292 --> 07:09.542
Miss Winters?

07:09.625 --> 07:12.542
Pierce Macabee.
I sent you a note earlier.

07:12.625 --> 07:15.458
Oh, yes. I just got it
a little while ago.

07:15.542 --> 07:17.375
I'm sorry, we had a conference
come through here

07:17.458 --> 07:18.667
and things have been
a little crazy.

07:18.750 --> 07:20.208
Not a problem. May I?

07:20.292 --> 07:21.625
- Of course.
- Thank you.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.167
So, what can I do for you?

07:24.250 --> 07:26.000
Well, actually it's more
a question of what I can do

07:26.083 --> 07:28.792
for you, really and what we
together can do for Earth.

07:28.875 --> 07:30.667
I'm regional director
of the newly-formed

07:30.750 --> 07:32.833
ministry of peace or Minipax

07:32.917 --> 07:34.500
as we like to call
it around the office.

07:34.583 --> 07:36.125
We're tryin' to round up support
for a series

07:36.208 --> 07:38.000
of new programs
we're launching.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.417
What kind of programs?

07:39.500 --> 07:42.125
Well, folks back home
are awfully nervous

07:42.208 --> 07:43.375
about all the fighting
going on out here.

07:43.458 --> 07:44.792
They need reassurance, you see?

07:44.875 --> 07:48.500
They need an environment
dedicated to peace, not war.

07:48.583 --> 07:50.625
'But we can never have
peace with our neighbors'

07:50.708 --> 07:52.208
'until we're at peace
with ourselves'

07:52.292 --> 07:54.292
so we at the ministry of peace
are trying

07:54.375 --> 07:55.792
to find new ways
to do just that.

07:55.875 --> 07:59.250
Ways we can better help each
other, work with each other.

07:59.333 --> 08:00.792
And for the next two days..

08:00.875 --> 08:03.333
I will be giving
a series of presentations

08:03.417 --> 08:04.958
in the lecture hall in Blue 6.

08:05.042 --> 08:08.583
Just, uh, station personnel
and a few hand-picked others.

08:08.667 --> 08:10.500
I've spoken to your
superiors back home

08:10.583 --> 08:12.708
and based on their
recommendations

08:12.792 --> 08:15.708
I'd like very much for you to
come hear what we're offering.

08:15.792 --> 08:18.208
Please say yes.

08:18.292 --> 08:21.833
Alright. I'll try.

What is it?
What is it? What? What?

08:46.917 --> 08:48.875
I just downloaded
your medical log.

08:48.958 --> 08:51.250
You haven't slept for 36 hours.

08:51.333 --> 08:53.250
Yeah. I, I've been kind of busy.

08:53.333 --> 08:56.750
I...took some stims
to get me through.

08:56.833 --> 08:59.583
There are no substitute
for food or few hours sleep.

08:59.667 --> 09:01.458
Yeah, well,
I've got work to do.

09:01.542 --> 09:02.750
And a whole staff of doctors

09:02.833 --> 09:04.417
who can do it just as well
as you can.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.583
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.292
I'm not playing that game.

09:07.375 --> 09:08.792
As of right now,
I'm relieving you of duty.

09:08.875 --> 09:10.000
Report to your quarters
and get some sleep.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.208
Six hours minimum.

09:11.292 --> 09:12.708
After that, report
to the mess hall

09:12.792 --> 09:15.000
and have something to eat.
I'll join you there.

09:15.083 --> 09:16.750
- But, but..
- I mean it.

09:16.833 --> 09:19.542
You're no use to me or anyone
else in this condition.

09:22.208 --> 09:24.583
Alright. Alright.

- Identicard.
- Oh. Of course.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.167
Is there a problem?

09:45.250 --> 09:47.208
No. No problem.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.250
I'm gonna have to ask you to
to step over there for a minute.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.958
Let me get these other people
through. It's just routine.

09:54.042 --> 09:56.083
But I thought you said there
wasn't a problem.

09:56.167 --> 09:58.917
Now there won't be
if you'll just step over there.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
I don't think
that'll be necessary.

my knowledge of the law

10:23.500 --> 10:26.542
is somewhat limited,
but I believe it's tradition

10:26.625 --> 10:29.458
if you're going to hold someone,
you should at least

10:29.542 --> 10:32.167

much less file a report.

11:55.542 --> 11:56.667
When I was back on my feet

11:56.750 --> 11:58.875
I sent a message
to Earth Central.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.625
I guess they
never received it.

12:02.875 --> 12:04.333
You're a damned liar.

12:05.875 --> 12:07.750
I'm sorry you feel that way
captain, but there's nothing

12:07.833 --> 12:11.708
I can do about that so, if
there's nothing else, I'd like..

12:13.625 --> 12:15.292
You're not leaving.

12:18.375 --> 12:20.292
You can't do this.

12:20.375 --> 12:21.417
Watch me.

12:23.042 --> 12:26.167
You're going to have to
charge me with something

12:26.250 --> 12:29.167
and last I heard,
being alive is not a crime.

12:32.583 --> 12:34.750
You seem to have
forgotten something, Mr. Morden.

12:37.167 --> 12:38.792
Earth central
thinks you're dead.

12:40.875 --> 12:44.333
Until I send them my report
you are still dead.

12:44.417 --> 12:48.625
That means you've got no rights,
no legal recourse..

12:48.708 --> 12:51.875
No one to miss you
if you don't turn up.

12:53.083 --> 12:56.000
You're playing a very
dangerous game, captain.

12:58.542 --> 13:00.458
Could cost you your command.

13:02.542 --> 13:04.542
One hundred and thirty nine
people died

13:04.625 --> 13:06.542
on board the Icarus,
Mr. Morden..

13:08.083 --> 13:09.542
...including my wife.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.542
And here you sit, not a scratch.

13:13.625 --> 13:15.708
Now something here
doesn't add up.

13:17.625 --> 13:19.417
I intend to find out
what happened

13:19.500 --> 13:22.000
what really happened.

13:24.167 --> 13:28.208
If necessary, you will sit here
for the next hour..

13:28.292 --> 13:31.542
...the next day, the next week
the next month, the next year

13:31.625 --> 13:34.375
the next 500 years!

13:34.458 --> 13:40.000
But you will not leave here
until I know...the truth.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.208
Better?

13:47.292 --> 13:49.958
You've been pretty quiet.
Did you get any sleep?

13:50.042 --> 13:51.792
As soon as my head
hit the pillow.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.333
Just had some bad dreams,
that's all.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.667
- About what?
- Ah, it's nothing.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.708
It must be something
if it's bothering you.

14:02.708 --> 14:04.875
Sometimes,
before I fall asleep

14:04.958 --> 14:07.292
I close my eyes.

14:07.375 --> 14:10.292
I see the face of every patient
that I ever lost.

14:11.500 --> 14:12.583
They're always there,
waiting for me

14:12.667 --> 14:15.667
right behind my eyelids,
every night.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.333
These past couple of days

14:20.417 --> 14:23.000
we've lost a lot
of Narns, Susan.

14:23.083 --> 14:25.500
This damn war
with the Centauri.

14:25.583 --> 14:28.042
I know. They just keep coming.

14:28.125 --> 14:30.750
They're crammed into
those refugee ships like..

14:30.833 --> 14:32.833
...sardines, you know.

14:32.917 --> 14:34.292
Sick, wounded.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.333
By the time they get here,
half of' em are

14:38.417 --> 14:39.833
beyond hope.

14:39.917 --> 14:43.708
Beyond help, yes.
Beyond hope..

14:46.500 --> 14:48.667
You believe in God, Susan?

14:51.167 --> 14:54.583
Um...I suppose.

14:54.667 --> 14:57.625
I mean, I was raised a Jew.
I went to temple.

14:57.708 --> 14:59.375
I was bat mitzvahed.

14:59.458 --> 15:01.167
I didn't ask how you spent
your adolescence.

15:01.250 --> 15:03.417
I asked if you believe
in God.

15:07.042 --> 15:08.250
Most of the time.

15:10.417 --> 15:11.458
Do you?

15:12.208 --> 15:14.875
I'm a foundationist.

15:14.958 --> 15:17.792
I've never heard of that one.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.208
Well, that's fairly new.

15:19.292 --> 15:21.875
Only been around
about 100 years.

15:21.958 --> 15:23.208
One of a bunch that sprouted
after

15:23.292 --> 15:26.167
we'd made contact with aliens.

15:26.250 --> 15:30.542
See, the idea is that God is too
big to be defined by words.

15:30.625 --> 15:33.375
Sort of like Zeno's paradox.

15:33.458 --> 15:35.042
You can never really get
anywhere because there's

15:35.125 --> 15:37.667
an infinite number of dots
between you and the object.

15:37.750 --> 15:41.000
The closer you get
to defining God..

15:41.958 --> 15:44.208
...the further away it gets.

15:44.292 --> 15:46.458
Okay. What does that have
to do with this?

15:53.083 --> 15:55.583
You know, when a patient starts
to slip away..

15:57.750 --> 16:00.375
I mean, he looks at you..

16:00.458 --> 16:03.208
And his eyes grab hold of you
the way a drowning man

16:03.292 --> 16:05.250
grabs hold of anything
to keep from sinking.

16:05.333 --> 16:06.958
I mean, afraid..

16:07.958 --> 16:09.250
So afraid..

16:10.833 --> 16:13.625
And then...just at the last

16:13.708 --> 16:16.625
it's as if they look past you
to something else

16:16.708 --> 16:17.875
and the look on their face

16:17.958 --> 16:20.667
it's like nothing
you can describe.

16:20.750 --> 16:24.042
And then,
just as they look past you

16:24.125 --> 16:26.042
the moment that
they look past you

16:26.125 --> 16:28.042
you can't help,
but meet their gaze

16:28.125 --> 16:29.917
and just for an instant

16:30.000 --> 16:33.708
you see God reflected
in their eyes.

16:35.917 --> 16:39.708
I've seen a lot of reflected
Gods today, Susan.

16:39.792 --> 16:42.542
And I'm wondering how we can
keep believing in them

16:42.625 --> 16:45.792
when they've stopped
believing in us.

16:45.875 --> 16:48.583
What was the color of the
transport that found you?

16:48.667 --> 16:50.500
- We've been over this.
- The color?

16:50.583 --> 16:51.750
Grey.

16:51.833 --> 16:54.250
- Two hours ago, you said white.
- No, I didn't.

16:54.333 --> 16:55.708
What was the ship's
ID number?

16:55.792 --> 16:57.833
- I don't remember.
- Where did it take you?

16:57.917 --> 17:00.000
It dropped me off at med station
on the Vega colony.

17:00.083 --> 17:02.750
There's no record
of you being there. Why?

17:02.833 --> 17:04.750
That's because I was unconscious
most of the time.

17:04.833 --> 17:06.917
They didn't have
much information.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.750
How many days did it take
to get there?

17:08.833 --> 17:10.250
Three, I think.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.250
'It's a five-day jump
to the Vega system.'

17:12.333 --> 17:13.583
What was the doctor's name?

17:13.667 --> 17:15.750
What was the ID number
of the transport?

17:15.833 --> 17:17.417
What was the name
of her Captain?

17:17.500 --> 17:18.750
What happened to the Icarus?

17:18.833 --> 17:20.792
I told you, I don't know.

17:20.875 --> 17:22.167
I don't remember.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.250
Well, you damn well better start
remembering, mister

17:24.333 --> 17:26.667
because by God, by the time
I am done with you

17:26.750 --> 17:29.417
you will wish
you had died on the Icarus!

17:30.708 --> 17:33.333
In the last 10 years
Earth has rebuilt

17:33.417 --> 17:35.083
its defenses magnificently.

17:35.167 --> 17:40.625
We can protect our people
from physical harm but..

17:40.708 --> 17:43.333
Is that enough?

17:43.417 --> 17:47.792
We cannot hope to make peace
with other civilizations

17:47.875 --> 17:50.875
until we have found peace
with ourselves.

17:50.958 --> 17:52.750
And that, quite simply

17:52.833 --> 17:54.833
is what the ministry of peace
is all about.

17:54.917 --> 17:59.375
Now, as Babylon 5 has
an early warning system

17:59.458 --> 18:03.042
to detect possible attacks,
we at the ministry of peace

18:03.125 --> 18:06.458
have created a system
of our own.

18:06.542 --> 18:08.417
We call it the night watch

18:08.500 --> 18:10.667
'named after
those brave citizens'

18:10.750 --> 18:12.500
'who stood vigil
in the darkness'

18:12.583 --> 18:13.958
against possible enemies.

18:14.042 --> 18:16.500
It's a completely volunteer
organization

18:16.583 --> 18:18.208
officially endorsed
by Earth Dome.

18:18.292 --> 18:20.833
Members receive
50 credits per week

18:20.917 --> 18:22.958
above and beyond
their regular salaries

18:23.042 --> 18:24.833
for services rendered.

18:24.917 --> 18:26.625
What kind of services?

18:26.708 --> 18:27.917
Well, mainly just to be present

18:28.000 --> 18:29.875
wearing the colors
of the night watch.

18:29.958 --> 18:31.500
Raise public awareness.

18:31.583 --> 18:34.125
Make them start thinking
about peace

18:34.208 --> 18:36.292
about the way
they treat one another.

18:36.375 --> 18:39.167
I can't believe Earth would pay
us 50 extra credits a week

18:39.250 --> 18:40.833
just to walk around the station.

18:40.917 --> 18:44.958
Correct. As the name implies
you must also be watchful.

18:45.042 --> 18:49.917
Peace can be made or broken
with a gun, a word, an idea

18:50.000 --> 18:51.458
even a thought.

18:51.542 --> 18:54.167
Now, those who work
against peace

18:54.250 --> 18:56.875
sow the seeds
of discontent.

18:56.958 --> 19:00.167
They plant false stories,
they undermine the public good.

19:00.250 --> 19:02.958
It's not because they are
necessarily evil.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.333
It's because they don't know
any better.

19:04.417 --> 19:05.875
They're rejected,
they're unhappy

19:05.958 --> 19:08.875
and they lash out
in the only way they can.

19:08.958 --> 19:12.042
So, if we could be made aware
of these problems as they occur

19:12.125 --> 19:15.125
then we can find these people,
we can talk to these people.

19:15.208 --> 19:18.083
We can embrace them again
in the arms of society

19:18.167 --> 19:21.333
while, at the same time,
protecting society

19:21.417 --> 19:24.042
from misinformation
and harmful ideas.

19:24.125 --> 19:26.333
'We're less interested
in actions'

19:26.417 --> 19:29.542
than we are in attitudes.

19:29.625 --> 19:35.125
We must help protect society
against its own worst instincts.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.125
And by taking these bold steps

19:37.208 --> 19:40.917
we will help to ensure
a better future for everyone.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.667
I'm proud to be a part of it
and I hope you'll all join me

19:44.750 --> 19:47.667
in becoming part
of the night watch.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.458
I think I'm gettin' to him.

19:54.542 --> 19:56.000
The more I pick his story
apart..

19:56.083 --> 19:58.083
- The more it doesn't add up.
- Captain..

19:58.167 --> 20:00.208
All I need is to find
one verifiable lie.

20:00.292 --> 20:02.250
Captain, you've had this guy in
here for well over ten hours.

20:02.333 --> 20:04.125
You still haven't charged him
with anything.

20:04.208 --> 20:05.667
I'm aware of that,
Mr. Garibaldi.

20:05.750 --> 20:08.083
No sir, I don't think you are.

20:08.167 --> 20:09.542
Look, sometimes
when I'm out in the world

20:09.625 --> 20:11.417
yeah, I play things
fast and loose.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.292
But inside this office,
I play it by the book.

20:13.375 --> 20:14.625
'This ain't even close.'

20:14.708 --> 20:16.167
I'll assume full responsibility.

20:16.250 --> 20:17.333
'Can't do that.'

20:17.417 --> 20:18.792
As head of security
every prisoner

20:18.875 --> 20:20.417
is my direct responsibility.

20:20.500 --> 20:21.833
I'm the one who's ultimately
accountable.

20:21.917 --> 20:24.333
It's my butt that'll be
brought up on charges.

20:24.417 --> 20:27.500
You can't look at him and tell
me you think he's legit!

20:27.583 --> 20:29.875
- He's hiding something!
- Of course, he is.

20:29.958 --> 20:31.417
And so are half the people
on this station.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.708
But you can't go around
arresting them for it.

20:33.792 --> 20:36.708
His station record's
clean as a whistle.

20:36.792 --> 20:38.417
Look, I know you're doing this
because of your wife.

20:38.500 --> 20:42.083
I can understand that.
So, let me cut him loose.

20:42.167 --> 20:43.583
I'll follow him around
until I can find

20:43.667 --> 20:44.750
something to charge him with.

20:44.833 --> 20:46.750
I won't let him out of the box.

20:46.833 --> 20:49.125
Not when I'm this close.

20:49.208 --> 20:51.375
Hell, he might jump ship!
I can't let that happen!

20:51.458 --> 20:52.958
Damn It, captain,
you can't go interrogating

20:53.042 --> 20:54.833
someone for 10 hours
without charges.

20:54.917 --> 20:57.750
- The regs say--
- Mr. Garibaldi.

20:57.833 --> 21:00.250
Interpreting the regulations
for a senior officer

21:00.333 --> 21:03.458
can be considered
an act of insubordination.

21:03.542 --> 21:06.250
Okay, so, now what? You going to
charge me with insubordination?

21:06.333 --> 21:09.500
Is that it? You wanna to lock
me up in the next cell?

21:09.583 --> 21:10.917
You pull the trigger
on this one, captain

21:11.000 --> 21:13.375
you damn well better be prepared
to back it up.

21:17.917 --> 21:20.125
I just need more time,
Michael, that's all.

21:22.583 --> 21:25.292
If he knows
what happened to Anna, if..

21:25.375 --> 21:27.667
...if he is somehow
responsible for..

21:31.667 --> 21:32.792
I'm sorry.

21:34.583 --> 21:36.083
I can't let him go.

21:37.625 --> 21:39.083
Well, I'm sorry, too.

21:39.167 --> 21:40.958
Because I can't be here
as chief of security

21:41.042 --> 21:42.750
while something like this
is going on.

21:42.833 --> 21:45.333
Either it stops,
or I resign

21:45.417 --> 21:46.833
effective immediately.

21:47.625 --> 21:49.125
What'll it be, captain?

21:57.708 --> 22:00.792
[instrumental music]

22:16.333 --> 22:17.958
You wanted to see me, captain?

22:19.833 --> 22:23.542
Mr. Garibaldi has taken
a brief leave of absence.

22:23.625 --> 22:25.333
On this kind of short notice.
He wouldn't--

22:25.417 --> 22:28.458
Uh, until his return..

22:28.542 --> 22:30.375
...I'm putting you in charge
of the prisoner.

22:30.458 --> 22:31.875
No one is to see him
or talk to him.

22:31.958 --> 22:33.208
Yes, sir.

22:33.292 --> 22:35.583
[beep beep]
Yes?

22:35.667 --> 22:37.000
(female #1)
'We've got Vir Cotto asking

22:37.083 --> 22:38.167
'to see you Captain.'

22:38.250 --> 22:39.167
It'll have to wait.

22:39.250 --> 22:40.833
'He says it's urgent.'

22:40.917 --> 22:41.917
[sighs]

22:42.958 --> 22:44.583
Alright, alright, Um..

22:44.667 --> 22:46.833
Tell him, I'll see him in my
office in 10 minutes.

22:46.917 --> 22:47.833
[beep beep]

22:47.917 --> 22:49.000
This shouldn't take long.

22:49.083 --> 22:51.833
Yes, sir.
Anything else?

22:53.667 --> 22:55.875
Find Talia Winters.

22:55.958 --> 22:57.167
Bring her here.

23:05.042 --> 23:06.417
I'm short on time,
Mr. Cotto

23:06.500 --> 23:09.958
so, if you'll please tell me,
what is so urgent?

23:10.042 --> 23:12.292
It's about Mr. Morden.

23:16.333 --> 23:17.833
You know him?

23:17.917 --> 23:18.958
Well, Ambassador Mollari

23:19.042 --> 23:20.667
has had some dealings with him.

23:20.750 --> 23:23.542
I have orders to ask
for his immediate release.

23:23.625 --> 23:25.333
So, what makes you think
we have him?

23:25.417 --> 23:28.292
Well, he had an appointment
to pick up some materials.

23:28.375 --> 23:31.458
One thing about Mr. Morden is he
never misses an appointment.

23:31.542 --> 23:33.458
The station's records show
that he didn't leave

23:33.542 --> 23:36.708
so I conclude
that you must have him.

23:36.792 --> 23:38.833
- We do.
- Ah.

23:38.917 --> 23:41.333
We're holding him
for questioning.

23:41.417 --> 23:42.792
Regarding?

23:42.875 --> 23:45.000
I'm afraid that's confidential.

23:45.083 --> 23:46.042
Oh.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.625
Nonetheless, Ambassador Mollari

23:47.708 --> 23:50.500
has asked for me to insist
upon his immediate release.

23:50.583 --> 23:52.583
He's an official guest
of the Centauri Republic

23:52.667 --> 23:55.375
and thus is eligible
for diplomatic immunity.

23:58.083 --> 24:01.750
Now, that's an awfully long way
to go on behalf of this guy.

24:02.750 --> 24:04.417
Why?

24:04.500 --> 24:07.250
What's he mean to Londo?
Who is he?

24:07.333 --> 24:09.875
He must have a lot of clout
with the Centauri Republic.

24:09.958 --> 24:13.083
But so far as he's told us
he's just an ordinary trader.

24:13.708 --> 24:15.333
I'm sorry, uh..

24:15.417 --> 24:17.208
- That's an internal matter.
- Oh?

24:17.292 --> 24:18.667
But I've told you

24:18.750 --> 24:21.042
we are extending diplomatic
immunity to Mr. Morden

24:21.125 --> 24:23.542
so please release him.

24:23.625 --> 24:25.583
Diplomatic immunity only applies

24:25.667 --> 24:27.708
when the subject
is charged with a crime.

24:27.792 --> 24:30.625
So far, Mr. Morden
hasn't been charged.

24:30.708 --> 24:34.042
We're holding him in,
uh, protective custody.

24:34.125 --> 24:35.667
Protecting him from what?

24:36.958 --> 24:39.333
I haven't decided yet.
Good day, Mr. Cotto.

24:42.792 --> 24:43.833
Captain, may I talk to you
for a minute.

24:43.917 --> 24:44.875
It's about this Morden?

24:44.958 --> 24:46.167
Get in line, Commander.

24:46.250 --> 24:47.750
I'm serious, I just spoke
to Garibaldi.

24:47.833 --> 24:49.833
- I assume he briefed you?
- He did.

24:49.917 --> 24:51.208
Then you know everything
you need to know.

24:51.292 --> 24:53.708
No, I don't!
captain, Listen.

24:53.792 --> 24:54.708
As your executive officer

24:54.792 --> 24:56.125
it's my responsibility to notify

24:56.208 --> 24:57.583
you if I think your behavior
is becoming..

24:57.667 --> 24:58.750
Irrational?

24:58.833 --> 25:01.167
That's as good a word as any.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.083
Thank you for your
notification, commander.

25:03.167 --> 25:04.500
Now, if you don't mind.

25:04.583 --> 25:06.375
Captain, look, you're
forcing me into a position

25:06.458 --> 25:07.667
where I'm going to
have to report this!

25:07.750 --> 25:09.292
And I don't want
to have to do that!

25:09.375 --> 25:11.542
- Don't you understand--
- I do understand, commander.

25:11.625 --> 25:13.750
I know how I look,
I know how I sound

25:13.833 --> 25:16.292
but I have to do this.

25:16.375 --> 25:18.750
For ten years, the only things
that mattered to me

25:18.833 --> 25:20.583
were my wife and my career.

25:20.667 --> 25:23.625
When she died, she took
the best part of me with her.

25:23.708 --> 25:26.750
I survived by telling myself
that it was an accident

25:26.833 --> 25:27.958
like everybody said.

25:28.042 --> 25:29.250
And focusing on
the one other thing

25:29.333 --> 25:31.833
that I had left, my job.

25:31.917 --> 25:34.167
And now, suddenly..

25:34.250 --> 25:36.250
That's all turned upside down.

25:37.917 --> 25:41.417
Maybe she was killed by that man
sitting in isolation right now.

25:41.500 --> 25:44.833
If you were in my position,
would you let him go?

25:44.917 --> 25:47.167
If you had that doubt
in your mind?

25:47.250 --> 25:48.375
Could you?

25:51.958 --> 25:53.250
No, I couldn't.

25:56.083 --> 25:57.667
Neither can I.

25:57.750 --> 26:00.292
Because the other possibility
is that if he is alive

26:00.375 --> 26:02.667
then maybe she is alive.

26:02.750 --> 26:05.333
And either way,
I have to know.

26:06.375 --> 26:09.333
Because without that..

26:09.417 --> 26:11.542
...nothing else means one damn.

26:14.458 --> 26:17.250
(Talia)
'I'm sorry, captain,
but I can't oblige you on this.'

26:17.333 --> 26:19.625
Psi-Corps rules prohibit
unauthorized scans

26:19.708 --> 26:21.750
in civil or criminal
investigations.

26:21.833 --> 26:23.958
How can it be unauthorized?

26:24.042 --> 26:25.458
According to
Earth Central records

26:25.542 --> 26:28.333
he is supposed to be dead.

26:28.417 --> 26:29.792
Can a dead man object?

26:29.875 --> 26:32.333
Captain, you're trying using
the letter of the law

26:32.417 --> 26:34.208
to defeat
the spirit of the law.

26:34.292 --> 26:37.250
'Now If you can get him to agree
to a scan without duress--'

26:37.333 --> 26:39.000
He won't.

26:39.083 --> 26:40.708
Then there's nothing
I can do.

26:42.792 --> 26:44.167
Alright.

26:44.250 --> 26:46.375
If you'll please wait outside
for just a minute?

26:52.625 --> 26:55.708
- Morden's in I-15, correct?
- Yes, sir.

26:55.792 --> 26:59.458
I imagine it's getting
pretty ripe in there by now.

26:59.542 --> 27:02.708
I want him moved immediately
to a holding cell, say..

27:02.792 --> 27:05.167
- 23.
- Alright, but why?

27:05.250 --> 27:08.083
And escort Miss Winters
back to her quarters

27:08.167 --> 27:10.292
through Blue 7.

27:10.375 --> 27:13.417
But sir, that'll put her in
the same hall as Morden.

27:13.500 --> 27:14.750
They'll pass each other.

27:15.375 --> 27:17.708
Yes. They will.

27:25.083 --> 27:27.000
[intense music]

27:39.292 --> 27:41.333
[screaming]

27:41.417 --> 27:43.750
I got her!
Get him out of here.

27:49.792 --> 27:51.250
Are you sure you're alright?

27:52.458 --> 27:53.667
I think so.

27:55.375 --> 27:56.625
It was terrible..

27:56.708 --> 28:00.417
Like falling
into a bottomless well.

28:00.500 --> 28:01.583
And cold.

28:02.250 --> 28:04.167
So cold.

28:04.250 --> 28:07.833
And just for a second,
I thought I saw this..

28:07.917 --> 28:09.625
What?
Wh-what did you see?

28:13.292 --> 28:14.542
A shape.

28:14.625 --> 28:16.083
I-I don't know.

28:16.167 --> 28:17.958
It was probably nothing.

28:19.917 --> 28:22.750
Well, still, you should
make a full report.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.375
I think I just did.

28:30.917 --> 28:33.833
Ms. Winters, for what it's
worth, I'm sorry.

28:33.917 --> 28:35.125
I didn't think, uh!

28:43.542 --> 28:44.375
[sighs]

28:44.458 --> 28:46.792
Guess I had that coming.

28:46.875 --> 28:48.458
I guess you did.

28:48.542 --> 28:49.917
Hope it was worth it.

28:51.292 --> 28:52.667
Well, her reaction tells me

28:52.750 --> 28:55.458
there's a lot more to this guy
than even I thought.

28:56.417 --> 28:57.667
And that's a start.

28:59.167 --> 29:00.500
Yeah, I suppose so.

29:02.417 --> 29:04.333
Look, can I give you
a piece of advice?

29:05.250 --> 29:07.917
Why not? Everybody else has.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.458
I've seen what the death
of a loved one can do to people.

29:10.542 --> 29:12.708
It's played out here every day.

29:12.792 --> 29:15.875
It can destroy you by making you
forget that you're not alone.

29:17.083 --> 29:18.208
'Look, you and I'

29:18.292 --> 29:21.000
our job descriptions
are different.

29:21.083 --> 29:23.125
But inside, we both carry
the silly notion

29:23.208 --> 29:26.500
that we can fix everything.

29:26.583 --> 29:30.292
Well, we can't.
And you have to face that.

29:30.375 --> 29:32.750
But you don't have to
face it alone.

29:40.042 --> 29:41.333
Captain.

29:41.417 --> 29:43.875
We have to speak with you
about Mr. Morden.

29:43.958 --> 29:45.917
You must release him at once.

29:47.333 --> 29:48.625
You, too?

29:49.667 --> 29:51.083
The both of you?

29:51.167 --> 29:53.875
I mean, who is this guy? Why is
everyone so interested in him?

29:54.000 --> 29:56.708
You will simply have to trust
us, captain.

29:56.792 --> 29:58.208
If you do not release him
quickly

29:58.292 --> 30:01.125
everyone here
is in terrible danger.

30:01.208 --> 30:03.542
No, not until
I get some answers

30:03.625 --> 30:05.125
once and for all.

30:09.292 --> 30:10.875
If this is the only way

30:10.958 --> 30:12.750
then we will give you
those answers.

30:12.833 --> 30:15.833
But be warned,
once you know his secret

30:15.917 --> 30:19.625
once you know what we have known
for the last three years

30:19.708 --> 30:22.167
you will never sleep well again.

30:22.250 --> 30:23.708
(Delenn)
'Come, Captain.'

30:23.792 --> 30:27.542
The greatest nightmare of our
time is waiting for you.

30:31.542 --> 30:33.000
[intense music]

30:37.125 --> 30:38.583
There are beings in the universe

30:38.667 --> 30:42.000
billions of years older
than either of our races.

30:42.750 --> 30:44.333
Once, long ago

30:44.417 --> 30:47.375
they walked
among the stars like giants..

30:47.458 --> 30:49.083
Vast and timeless.

30:50.208 --> 30:51.750
They taught the younger races

30:51.833 --> 30:55.542
explored beyond the Rim,
created great empires.

30:55.625 --> 30:58.667
But to all things,
there is an end.

30:58.750 --> 31:00.583
Slowly, over
a million years

31:00.667 --> 31:03.250
the First Ones went away.

31:03.333 --> 31:05.958
Some passed beyond the stars,
never to return.

31:07.667 --> 31:10.292
'Some simply disappeared.'

31:10.375 --> 31:11.417
Delenn..

31:12.667 --> 31:14.375
I-I'm sure
this is all very interesting

31:14.458 --> 31:17.167
but what does any of this have
to do with Morden?

31:18.417 --> 31:21.083
Not all of the First Ones
have gone away.

31:21.875 --> 31:23.417
A few stayed behind

31:23.500 --> 31:26.083
hidden or asleep,
waiting for the day

31:26.167 --> 31:28.083
when they may be needed..

31:28.167 --> 31:30.625
When the shadows come again.

31:30.708 --> 31:32.417
Shadows?

31:32.500 --> 31:34.083
We have no other name for them.

31:35.083 --> 31:36.792
The shadows were old

31:36.875 --> 31:39.625
when even
the ancients were young.

31:39.708 --> 31:41.292
They battled one another
over and over

31:41.375 --> 31:43.417
across a million years.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.292
The last great war against
the shadows

31:45.375 --> 31:47.792
was 10,000 years ago.

31:47.875 --> 31:51.708
It was the last time the
ancients walked openly among us.

31:51.792 --> 31:54.417
But the shadows
were only defeated

31:54.500 --> 31:55.875
not destroyed.

31:57.250 --> 31:59.667
A thousand years ago

31:59.750 --> 32:01.792
the shadows returned
to their places of power

32:01.875 --> 32:05.792
rebuild them and began
to stretch forth their hand.

32:05.875 --> 32:07.000
Before they could strike

32:07.083 --> 32:09.500
they were defeated
by an alliance of worlds

32:09.583 --> 32:11.833
including the Minbari..

32:11.917 --> 32:14.583
And the few remaining
First Ones

32:14.667 --> 32:17.042
who have not yet passed
beyond the veil.

32:18.083 --> 32:19.833
When they had finished

32:19.917 --> 32:21.667
the First Ones went away..

32:22.417 --> 32:24.750
All but one.

32:27.292 --> 32:29.500
There's still one of them left.

32:30.917 --> 32:32.000
Where?

32:40.417 --> 32:43.417
That is why Kosh cannot leave
his encounter suit.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.125
He would be recognized.

32:46.125 --> 32:47.958
Recognized? By whom?

32:49.958 --> 32:51.750
Everyone.

32:51.833 --> 32:54.750
For centuries,
the Vorlons stood alone

32:54.833 --> 32:56.917
the last remaining guardians..

32:57.000 --> 32:58.917
Watching and waiting.

32:59.708 --> 33:01.833
Then, last year

33:01.917 --> 33:03.625
I sent Kosh a message.

33:08.042 --> 33:10.542
- Did you see Ambassador Kosh?
- I did.

33:12.458 --> 33:15.542
Did you relay
my question precisely..

33:16.375 --> 33:18.542
...word for word?

33:18.625 --> 33:20.250
I did.

33:20.333 --> 33:21.917
His reaction?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.458
Just one word.

33:24.542 --> 33:26.583
He said "Yes."

33:35.083 --> 33:36.792
If "Yes" was the answer

33:37.708 --> 33:39.833
what was the question?

33:39.917 --> 33:43.125
Have the shadows
returned to Z'ha'dum?

33:44.375 --> 33:45.500
Z'ha'dum?

33:47.167 --> 33:48.792
That's the world..

33:48.875 --> 33:51.375
...G'kar's been warning us
about all year.

33:52.167 --> 33:53.292
Sheridan..

33:54.333 --> 33:55.500
Learn.

34:00.292 --> 34:03.292
(Delenn)
Icarus, your wife's ship

34:03.375 --> 34:06.958
sent to investigate the ruins
of an ancient race

34:07.042 --> 34:09.792
no one has ever
heard of before.

34:09.875 --> 34:11.458
(Kosh)
Z'ha'dum.

34:19.042 --> 34:20.542
We have a blip on the K-Lens.

34:20.625 --> 34:21.750
(female #2)
'Roger that, Two, we're sending'

34:21.833 --> 34:23.208
'an I-R team down there.'

34:23.292 --> 34:26.292
'Keep scanning this sector
for more information.'

34:26.375 --> 34:27.833
Check.
Harper, sir.

34:27.917 --> 34:31.042
We're starting to advance
on quadrant 814.

34:32.208 --> 34:34.917
[intense music]

34:49.250 --> 34:50.542
[instrumental music]

34:52.458 --> 34:53.708
Oh..

34:54.750 --> 34:55.917
And, uh..

34:57.458 --> 34:58.792
The Icarus..

34:58.875 --> 35:00.042
They-they found something.

35:00.125 --> 35:02.667
- Then they woke something up.
- Yes.

35:02.750 --> 35:05.458
Once awakened, the shadows
could not allow them to leave

35:05.542 --> 35:07.542
in case they might warn others.

35:07.625 --> 35:10.417
Those who would not serve
were killed.

35:10.500 --> 35:11.958
But were they all killed?

35:12.792 --> 35:14.792
Delenn, maybe..

35:14.875 --> 35:17.208
Maybe some of them were
kept alive as prisoners.

35:17.292 --> 35:19.667
Anna might still be alive!

35:19.750 --> 35:22.708
- Morden--
- Must be released.

35:25.250 --> 35:26.417
After what you just showed me

35:26.500 --> 35:28.750
how can you ask me to

35:28.833 --> 35:30.292
to let him go?

35:30.375 --> 35:34.042
Because right now they do not
know how much we know.

35:34.125 --> 35:36.208
The last time, the shadows lost

35:36.292 --> 35:38.167
because they moved too quickly.

35:38.250 --> 35:42.167
Now they are being careful
gathering their forces slowly.

35:42.250 --> 35:44.667
If you push Morden,
sooner or later

35:44.750 --> 35:46.667
he will tell you what happened.

35:46.750 --> 35:48.375
Then he will be killed..

35:48.458 --> 35:50.333
'And you will be killed.'

35:50.417 --> 35:52.042
The shadows will move now

35:52.125 --> 35:54.000
before we're ready for them.

35:55.125 --> 35:56.375
How are they going to know?

35:56.458 --> 35:59.167
Because Morden is never alone.

35:59.250 --> 36:01.708
Listen to me,
aside from the Vorlons

36:01.792 --> 36:04.833
we do not have the first ones
to help us this time.

36:04.917 --> 36:06.542
We are on our own.

36:06.625 --> 36:09.500
We will have
only one chance to stop them

36:09.583 --> 36:13.750
and if we fail,
billions will die.

36:13.833 --> 36:17.458
There comes a moment when each
of us must pledge himself

36:17.542 --> 36:20.292
to something greater
than himself.

36:20.375 --> 36:22.750
You told G'kar he had to decide

36:22.833 --> 36:26.542
between revenge
and the good of his own people.

36:26.625 --> 36:30.167
Now you must make
the same decision, captain.

36:30.250 --> 36:32.875
It will be the most
important decision

36:32.958 --> 36:34.292
'of your life.'

36:43.333 --> 36:45.250
It's late, captain.

36:45.333 --> 36:46.792
You want to get some sleep?

36:50.625 --> 36:52.625
- Zack.
- Sir?

36:56.542 --> 36:58.750
You ever studied
ancient history..

36:58.833 --> 37:01.500
20th century,
World War II?

37:02.375 --> 37:04.833
Well.. Not really.

37:04.917 --> 37:08.083
I always used to fall asleep
in history class.

37:09.667 --> 37:11.958
The Germans had a secret code

37:12.042 --> 37:14.958
they used for all
their important messages.

37:15.042 --> 37:16.583
It was called "Enigma."

37:17.583 --> 37:18.917
What they didn't know was that

37:19.000 --> 37:22.125
the British
had cracked the code.

37:22.208 --> 37:24.583
One day, Churchill's people
intercepted a message

37:24.667 --> 37:27.917
authorizing the bombing
of a city named Coventry.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.208
Now, if they
evacuated Coventry

37:31.292 --> 37:33.500
the Germans would know
their code had been broken

37:33.583 --> 37:35.417
and switch to another system.

37:36.625 --> 37:37.708
And if that happened

37:37.792 --> 37:40.833
it could cost the allies
the entire war.

37:42.625 --> 37:44.667
If they didn't
evacuate the city..

37:46.375 --> 37:50.500
...hundreds of innocent men,
women, and children would die.

37:51.792 --> 37:53.875
So, what happened?

37:55.208 --> 37:57.000
They kept the secret.

37:59.458 --> 38:01.042
There was no evacuation.

38:03.875 --> 38:06.500
And on November 14th, 1940..

38:08.333 --> 38:10.333
...Coventry was destroyed.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.458
The dead were..

38:17.042 --> 38:19.958
...piled up like cordwood.

38:20.042 --> 38:23.750
I-I've seen newsreels
of Churchill visiting the ruins

38:23.833 --> 38:25.458
a few days later.

38:31.375 --> 38:33.250
And you could just..

38:33.333 --> 38:35.167
...see it in his eyes..

38:36.708 --> 38:39.125
...the knowledge
of what he'd done.

38:41.958 --> 38:43.458
It was dark..

38:43.542 --> 38:44.833
...haunted.

38:49.500 --> 38:50.708
All these years,
I've never been able

38:50.792 --> 38:52.500
to get that image
out of my head.

38:56.708 --> 38:59.625
I'm glad it's a decision
I don't have to make.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.042
I don't think I could
live with myself.

39:05.208 --> 39:07.833
'How many lives
is a secret worth?'

39:08.750 --> 39:10.083
[echoing vibrations]

39:11.875 --> 39:13.042
What was that sound?

39:13.125 --> 39:14.750
I don't know,
we've been pickin' it up

39:14.833 --> 39:15.917
now and then from the new cell.

39:16.000 --> 39:16.917
We just put a new microphone

39:17.000 --> 39:18.375
in there a few days ago, but..

39:18.458 --> 39:21.250
Well, I guess
it's malfunctioning.

39:21.333 --> 39:22.583
"Never alone," she said.

39:22.667 --> 39:25.250
[echoing vibration]

39:25.333 --> 39:26.875
Can you adjust the monitor..

39:26.958 --> 39:28.417
Scan on different wavelengths..

39:28.500 --> 39:30.125
'Infrared, ultraviolet?'

39:30.208 --> 39:31.583
Yeah, I think so.

39:31.667 --> 39:32.708
Do it!

39:37.292 --> 39:38.708
[indistinct buzzing]

39:41.375 --> 39:42.583
Stop!

39:44.708 --> 39:45.708
What?

39:48.875 --> 39:50.167
What did you see?

39:56.208 --> 39:57.333
Nothing.

39:58.292 --> 39:59.458
Shadows.

40:05.917 --> 40:07.208
Cut him loose.

40:07.875 --> 40:09.500
Tell him

40:09.583 --> 40:12.250
it was all a mistake,
and he can go.

40:12.333 --> 40:13.583
You're sure?

40:14.583 --> 40:15.875
Mm-hmm.

40:41.042 --> 40:42.583
I cut him loose.

40:43.917 --> 40:45.958
You were right.
I was wrong.

40:48.500 --> 40:49.875
Come on back to work.

40:51.417 --> 40:52.958
What happened
to change your mind?

40:53.875 --> 40:55.375
I'd rather not talk about that.

40:56.583 --> 40:58.375
I'm not so sure I like
the sound of that.

41:01.750 --> 41:03.333
Next time..

41:03.417 --> 41:04.708
...you'll listen to me?

41:04.792 --> 41:06.167
Won't be a next time.

41:08.708 --> 41:11.375
- Okay.
- Thanks.

41:12.500 --> 41:13.542
Hey, captain..

41:15.292 --> 41:17.292
You're sure you're okay?

41:17.375 --> 41:18.542
Yes.

41:25.208 --> 41:26.292
He alright?

41:27.208 --> 41:28.458
I don't know.

41:30.125 --> 41:31.708
- What's that?
- What?

41:31.792 --> 41:33.375
Oh. Nothin'.

41:33.458 --> 41:34.708
I figured, what the hell?

41:34.792 --> 41:36.375
Earth wants
to throw around its money

41:36.458 --> 41:37.708
who am I to say no?

41:37.792 --> 41:39.958
Fifty extra credits a week
to walk around

41:40.042 --> 41:42.708
and do what
I do anyway? Why not?

41:54.250 --> 41:55.625
I let him go.

41:58.750 --> 42:00.833
But there is
a price tag attached.

42:03.250 --> 42:06.625
You've been trying to help me
so we can understand each other.

42:08.625 --> 42:10.083
That's not what I want anymore.

42:12.208 --> 42:14.125
I want you to teach me

42:14.208 --> 42:17.208
how to fight them,
how to beat them.

42:18.750 --> 42:21.917
Because sooner or later,
I'm going to Z'ha'dum.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.625
And I'm going to stop them.

42:28.417 --> 42:30.958
If you go to Z'ha'dum

42:31.667 --> 42:33.333
you will die.

42:37.458 --> 42:38.750
Then I die.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.833
But I will not go down easily
and I will not go down alone.

42:47.333 --> 42:48.583
You will teach me?

42:50.000 --> 42:51.292
Yes.

42:52.708 --> 42:54.750
[instrumental music]

43:05.917 --> 43:08.083
[theme music]
