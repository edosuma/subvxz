WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:03.378
...SHE BRUSHED ME OFF

00:01.710 --> 00:03.378
WITH A WAVE OF HER REGAL HAND.

00:03.420 --> 00:05.673
NOT EVEN A WORD,

00:03.420 --> 00:05.673
JUST A...

00:05.714 --> 00:07.257
LIKE I'M HER CABANA BOY.

00:07.299 --> 00:10.051
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, INSTEAD

00:07.299 --> 00:10.051
OF WALKING OUT OF THE ROOM,

00:10.093 --> 00:11.971
SHE'LL MAKE ME BOW

00:10.093 --> 00:11.971
AND BACK OUT.

00:12.011 --> 00:14.515
IMPERIOUS ATTITUDE.

00:12.011 --> 00:14.515
SHE NEVER GIVES IT A REST.

00:14.556 --> 00:18.018
I SCHLEPPED HER TO THE DOCTOR

00:14.556 --> 00:18.018
THE OTHER DAY --

00:14.556 --> 00:18.018
BY COMMAND, NOT REQUEST --

00:18.059 --> 00:21.355
AND THE ELEVATOR OPERATOR THERE

00:18.059 --> 00:21.355
GREETED US NICE AND FRIENDLY.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.190
HER DOCTOR'S

00:21.396 --> 00:23.190
ON THE SECOND FLOOR,

00:23.231 --> 00:26.777
AND BY THE TIME WE GOT THERE,

00:23.231 --> 00:26.777
THAT OPERATOR WAS IN TEARS.

00:27.987 --> 00:30.447
WHEW!

00:27.987 --> 00:30.447
WHAT?

00:30.489 --> 00:32.992
WELL, MOM, YOU JUST DID

00:30.489 --> 00:32.992
20 STRAIGHT MINUTES ON GRAN.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.076
IT WASN'T 20 MINUTES.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.076
IT WAS GETTING THERE.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.913
HOW ABOUT A MORATORIUM

00:35.118 --> 00:37.913
ON THE GRAN STORIES FOR A BIT?

00:37.955 --> 00:40.708
FINE. I'D RATHER NOT SPOIL

00:37.955 --> 00:40.708
THE MEAL WITH TALK OF HER.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.168
GOOD.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.168
I SHOULD JUST WASH MY HANDS.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.420
OKAY.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.420
WE'LL WAIT.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.173
I MEAN, OF HER.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.173
OH, GOOD. WASH THOSE HANDS.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.425
SHE SUCKS HER OLIVE PITS...

00:48.215 --> 00:50.425
SHORT MORATORIUM.

00:50.467 --> 00:53.387
TRYING TO EXTRACT EVERY LAST

00:50.467 --> 00:53.387
OUNCE OF FLAVOR OUT OF THEM,

00:53.428 --> 00:54.596
LIKE SHE DOES PEOPLE.

00:54.638 --> 00:56.223
SHE SUCKS FLAVOR

00:54.638 --> 00:56.223
OUT OF PEOPLE?

00:56.264 --> 00:58.726
CAN WE

00:56.264 --> 00:58.726
CHANGE THE SUBJECT?

00:56.264 --> 00:58.726
LIFE, NOT FLAVOR.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.728
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT

00:58.767 --> 01:00.728
GRAN NEEDS?

00:58.767 --> 01:00.728
WHAT?

01:00.769 --> 01:02.897
A FELLA.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.897
WITH OR WITHOUT

01:00.769 --> 01:02.897
AN UMBRELLA.

01:02.938 --> 01:06.483
HE'D HAVE TO LOOK

01:02.938 --> 01:06.483
LIKE AN OLIVE PIT.

01:02.938 --> 01:06.483
IT'S LIKE A DEAN MARTIN ROAST.

01:06.525 --> 01:08.527
THOSE ARE NEVER

01:06.525 --> 01:08.527
FUNNY TO ME.

01:06.525 --> 01:08.527
THEY'RE MEAN.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.238
EXCEPT FOR DON RICKLES.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.238
TOTALLY EXCEPT FOR RICKLES.

01:11.279 --> 01:15.409
I THINK SHE HAD A MAN

01:11.279 --> 01:15.409
FOR A TIME SQUIRING HER AROUND

01:11.279 --> 01:15.409
TO HER BIDDY AFFAIRS.

01:15.450 --> 01:18.829
RICHARD THOUGHT SO, TOO.

01:15.450 --> 01:18.829
IT HORRIFIED HIM.

01:15.450 --> 01:18.829
DIDN'T WANT A NEW DADDY, HUH?

01:18.871 --> 01:20.915
THEN HE SEEMED SUDDENLY

01:18.871 --> 01:20.915
OUT OF THE PICTURE.

01:20.956 --> 01:23.042
SO GREAT-GRANDMA NEVER

01:20.956 --> 01:23.042
TALKED ABOUT HIM?

01:20.956 --> 01:23.042
NEVER.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.420
EVEN THOUGH I COULD TELL

01:23.083 --> 01:26.420
PRACTICALLY THE DAY

01:23.083 --> 01:26.420
SHE STOPPED SEEING HIM.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.505
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS

01:26.461 --> 01:28.505
ARE ALWAYS OBVIOUS.

01:28.547 --> 01:31.592
YEAH, I GUESS.

01:28.547 --> 01:31.592
WHEN A COUPLE IS IN

01:28.547 --> 01:31.592
A RELATIONSHIP,

01:31.633 --> 01:32.801
AND THEN SUDDENLY ISN'T.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.261
RIGHT.

01:36.095 --> 01:37.973
IS SHE STILL LOOKING?

01:38.015 --> 01:40.017
YEP.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.017
RIGHT.

01:40.059 --> 01:42.853
UM, YOU KNOW, GRANDMA,

01:40.059 --> 01:42.853
DID I MENTION THAT,

01:42.895 --> 01:44.688
UNFORTUNATELY,

01:42.895 --> 01:44.688
I'M NOT WITH DEAN ANYMORE?

01:44.730 --> 01:46.899
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.899
WELL, I'M NOT.

01:46.941 --> 01:49.234
WELL, YES, I'VE KNOWN

01:46.941 --> 01:49.234
FOR WEEKS, ACTUALLY,

01:49.276 --> 01:52.029
BUT IT'S GOOD THAT

01:49.276 --> 01:52.029
YOU CONFIRMED IT.

01:49.276 --> 01:52.029
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

01:52.071 --> 01:55.908
YOU ABRUPTLY STOPPED MENTIONING

01:52.071 --> 01:55.908
HIM 11 DINNERS AGO, SO I FIGURED

01:52.071 --> 01:55.908
THAT WAS THE CASE.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.534
11 DINNERS?

01:55.950 --> 01:57.534
YOU KEPT COUNT?

01:57.576 --> 01:58.869
11.

01:58.911 --> 02:00.788
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T

01:58.911 --> 02:00.788
TELL YOU, GRANDMA.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.289
I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.583
WHAT IF I HAD INVITED DEAN

02:02.330 --> 02:04.583
TO AN EVENT,

02:04.625 --> 02:08.462
AND YOU WERE NO LONGER WITH HIM,

02:04.625 --> 02:08.462
IT WOULD'VE BEEN EMBARRASSING.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.798
WHAT KINDA EVENT

02:08.503 --> 02:10.798
WOULD YOU HAVE INVITED DEAN TO?

02:10.839 --> 02:12.883
I DON'T KNOW. A WEDDING.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.883
FOR WHO?

02:12.925 --> 02:14.468
A MUTUAL FRIEND OR SOMETHING.

02:14.509 --> 02:17.471
YOU AND DEAN HAVE MUTUAL FRIENDS

02:14.509 --> 02:17.471
IN COMMON THAT WE DON'T?

02:17.512 --> 02:21.058
WHO WOULD THAT BE?

02:17.512 --> 02:21.058
THE TALBOTTS, OR THAT SENIOR

02:17.512 --> 02:21.058
PARTNER AT DELOITTE AND TOUCHE?

02:21.100 --> 02:24.144
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEANT. IT'S

02:21.100 --> 02:24.144
ALWAYS BEST TO TELL EACH OTHER

02:24.185 --> 02:26.605
MAJOR LIFE EVENTS SO THAT

02:24.185 --> 02:26.605
THERE'S NO AWKWARDNESS.

02:26.647 --> 02:30.109
WELL, GRANDMA, I PROBABLY ALSO

02:26.647 --> 02:30.109
FAILED TO MENTION THAT

02:26.647 --> 02:30.109
I'M SEEING SOMEONE ELSE.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.693
WHO?

02:30.150 --> 02:31.693
JESS.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.947
JESS.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.947
LUKE'S NEPHEW.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.947
LUKE FROM THE DINER.

02:34.989 --> 02:36.657
OH.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.533
I SEE.

02:38.575 --> 02:41.912
AM I GOING TO

02:38.575 --> 02:41.912
GET TO MEET HIM SOON?

02:38.575 --> 02:41.912
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

02:41.954 --> 02:44.999
YEAH, THAT MIGHT BE

02:41.954 --> 02:44.999
HARD TO ARRANGE.

02:41.954 --> 02:44.999
HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

02:45.040 --> 02:47.542
BRING HIM OVER

02:45.040 --> 02:47.542
FOR DINNER SOMETIME.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.542
HOW ABOUT NEXT FRIDAY?

02:47.584 --> 02:48.961
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

02:49.003 --> 02:51.463
YEAH, MOM, THAT MIGHT BE

02:49.003 --> 02:51.463
HARD TO ARRANGE.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.299
IT'S PERFECT TIMING. RICHARD

02:51.505 --> 02:54.299
WILL STILL BE OUT OF TOWN,

02:54.341 --> 02:57.094
IT'LL BE NICE TO ROUND

02:54.341 --> 02:57.094
OFF THE GROUP WITH A FOURTH.

02:57.136 --> 02:59.638
HE WORKS FRIDAYS, DOESN'T HE?

02:57.136 --> 02:59.638
YEAH, THAT'S HIS USUAL NIGHT.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.806
IT'S A BAD NIGHT.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.766
OH. OKAY.

03:02.808 --> 03:05.644
I SUPPOSE I'LL EVENTUALLY MEET

03:02.808 --> 03:05.644
HIM SOMEDAY AT SOME FUNCTION.

03:05.686 --> 03:09.064
PERHAPS A WEDDING.

03:05.686 --> 03:09.064
OR RORY'S GRADUATION.

03:09.106 --> 03:10.482
THAT'S GOOD.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.860
THAT WAY, WE'LL ALL GET

03:10.524 --> 03:12.860
TO MEET HIM --

03:12.901 --> 03:15.278
MYSELF, RICHARD, GRAN.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.823
MAYBE I'LL BRING

03:15.320 --> 03:17.823

03:17.865 --> 03:20.159
REVEREND MAHONEY

03:17.865 --> 03:20.159

03:20.199 --> 03:24.496
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, JESS

03:20.199 --> 03:24.496
DOES HAVE NEXT FRIDAY NIGHT OFF.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.999

03:24.538 --> 03:26.999
LET'S MAKE IT A FOURSOME.

NAILS, AND JIM.

04:51.332 --> 04:52.834
YOU DON'T GO TO THE GYM.

04:52.876 --> 04:55.129
JIM IS COMING HERE

04:52.876 --> 04:55.129
TO FIX THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.337
JIM DUNNING. GOT IT.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.965
I ALSO HAVE

04:56.379 --> 04:57.965
"RESHAPLABASHAM."

04:58.006 --> 05:00.008
WHAT?

04:58.006 --> 05:00.008
I DON'T KNOW.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.008
I CAN'T READ IT.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.509
SHOULDN'T YOU CHANGE

05:00.050 --> 05:01.509
YOUR SYSTEM?

05:01.551 --> 05:03.678
GO ELECTRONIC OR SOMETHING?

05:01.551 --> 05:03.678
YOU'RE A BUSY WOMAN.

05:03.720 --> 05:07.390
UH, HEY, MY SYSTEM WORKS.

05:03.720 --> 05:07.390
TELL THAT TO THE GUY WHO

05:03.720 --> 05:07.390

05:07.432 --> 05:08.892
YOU MISSED YOUR

05:07.432 --> 05:08.892
"RESHAPLABASHAM" APPOINTMENT.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.019
I HATE THAT WE HAVE TO

05:08.934 --> 05:11.019
COORDINATE SCHEDULES.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.063
IF WE DON'T WE'LL

05:11.061 --> 05:13.063
NEVER SEE EACH OTHER.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.356
WE NEVER USED TO DO THIS.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.356
WE'RE BUSIER NOW.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.400
LET'S RUN AWAY

05:15.398 --> 05:17.400
AND LEAVE ALL THIS BEHIND.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.694
YOU MEAN OUR HOUSE?

05:17.442 --> 05:19.694
NO, WE'LL TAKE THE HOUSE.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.989
WE'LL LEAVE EVERYTHING ELSE.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.989

05:27.702 --> 05:31.081
THAT'LL MAKE IT NICE AND QUIET

05:27.702 --> 05:31.081
FOR WHEN I STUDY.

05:27.702 --> 05:31.081
I'M THAT LOUD?

05:31.123 --> 05:33.458
YES. WHEN YOU DANCE AROUND

05:31.123 --> 05:33.458
SINGING "RORY'S STUDYING" SONGS.

11:45.246 --> 11:48.291
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

11:48.333 --> 11:51.127
OR, I COULD BANG ON THE DOOR

11:48.333 --> 11:51.127
AND YELL, "WE'RE NECKING."

11:51.169 --> 11:53.547
WE STILL NEED A SIGNAL.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.547
WE'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.674
HEY, LISTEN, ALEX AND I

11:53.588 --> 11:55.674
WERE TALKING ABOUT

11:55.714 --> 11:57.384
GOING TO NEW YORK

11:55.714 --> 11:57.384
NEXT WEEKEND.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.635
FUN.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.635
YEAH.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.428
HE'S GOT FOUR

11:58.677 --> 12:00.428
TICKETS TO A SHOW,

12:00.470 --> 12:03.473
AND HE WANTS TO INVITE

12:00.470 --> 12:03.473
SOOKIE AND JACKSON TOO.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.058
IS IT, "BUCKLE UP, I'M PATTY?"

12:05.099 --> 12:06.518
HUH?

12:05.099 --> 12:06.518
NOTHING.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.895
WE'D HAVE TO LEAVE

12:06.560 --> 12:08.895
FRIDAY DAY.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.895
SO?

12:08.936 --> 12:12.607
MEANING IT'S JUST YOU

12:08.936 --> 12:12.607
AND JESS ALONE AT DINNER

12:12.649 --> 12:13.983
WITH THE GLORIOUS EMILY.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.694
THAT'S TOTALLY FINE.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.694
ARE YOU SURE?

12:15.734 --> 12:17.612
IT MIGHT EVEN MAKE THINGS

12:15.734 --> 12:17.612
EASIER.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.113
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

12:17.654 --> 12:19.113
NOTHING.

12:19.155 --> 12:22.200
JUST IT MIGHT MAKE IT

12:19.155 --> 12:22.200
LESS PRESSURE-PACKED.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.370
SO, I'M LOUD WHEN YOU STUDY AND

12:22.242 --> 12:25.370
MAKE SOCIAL GATHERINGS WORSE?

12:25.412 --> 12:27.163
OUT OF THE GOODNESS

12:25.412 --> 12:27.163
OF YOUR HEART,

12:27.205 --> 12:29.207
YOU'D BE TRYING TO

12:27.205 --> 12:29.207
SHIELD ME ALL NIGHT,

12:29.249 --> 12:31.501
AND THAT MIGHT MAKE THINGS

12:29.249 --> 12:31.501
WORSE. OUT OF LOVE.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.545
I LOVE YOU,

12:31.543 --> 12:33.545
I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT.

12:33.587 --> 12:36.339
OKAY. I THINK I GET IT.

12:33.587 --> 12:36.339
I HAVE THE BEST INTENTIONS.

12:36.381 --> 12:39.217
BINGO.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.343
HELLO?

12:39.259 --> 12:40.343
Jess: Hi.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.011
HEY, HOW WAS WORK?

12:42.053 --> 12:43.888
I TOTED THE BARGE,

12:42.053 --> 12:43.888
LIFTED THE BALE.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.433
YOU'RE A GREAT BARGE TOTER.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.433
I CAN ATTEST TO THAT.

12:46.474 --> 12:47.684
How was your day?

12:47.726 --> 12:49.102
FINE. A LOT OF STUDYING.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.937
OH, YEAH?

12:49.143 --> 12:50.937
IS THAT ALL YOU DID?

12:50.978 --> 12:52.564
Yeah, basically.

12:50.978 --> 12:52.564
BASICALLY?

12:52.606 --> 12:53.772
JESS, WHAT --

12:53.814 --> 12:55.942
I HEARD THAT YOU WERE

12:53.814 --> 12:55.942
WITH DEAN TODAY.

12:55.983 --> 12:58.819
WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?

12:55.983 --> 12:58.819
It's all over town.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.655
I WAS WITH HIM

12:58.861 --> 13:00.655
FOR A WHILE,

13:00.697 --> 13:03.241
BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:00.697 --> 13:03.241
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FLIERS?

13:03.283 --> 13:05.493
I'VE BEEN HOME ALL NIGHT.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.493
WHAT FLIERS?

13:05.535 --> 13:07.662
IT SAYS,

13:05.535 --> 13:07.662
"PEOPLE ARE ALREADY RAVING

13:07.704 --> 13:10.373
ABOUT MISS PATTY'S

13:07.704 --> 13:10.373
ONE-WOMAN SHOW."

13:07.704 --> 13:10.373
And?

13:10.415 --> 13:11.958
THERE'S SOME BLURBS.

13:11.999 --> 13:14.711
ONE SAYS, "RORY AND DEAN

13:11.999 --> 13:14.711
COULDN'T STOP TALKING ABOUT IT."

13:14.753 --> 13:17.004
WE'RE ON A FLIER?

13:14.753 --> 13:17.004
You and a few others.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.090
THE MAILMAN SAYS,

13:17.046 --> 13:19.090
"EVEN WITHOUT PROPER POSTAGE,

13:19.132 --> 13:20.759
THIS SHOW DELIVERS."

13:20.799 --> 13:23.136
SHE'S MAKING THAT UP,

13:20.799 --> 13:23.136
'CAUSE RALPH'S NOT THAT WITTY.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.929
WERE YOU HANGING OUT

13:23.177 --> 13:24.929
THERE WITH DEAN?

13:24.971 --> 13:26.805
I WAS NOT HANGING OUT

13:24.971 --> 13:26.805
WITH DEAN.

13:26.847 --> 13:29.601
WE WERE HAULED IN THERE

13:26.847 --> 13:29.601
TO WATCH HER TRY OUT MATERIAL

13:29.643 --> 13:31.894
WE WERE SITTING TOGETHER

13:29.643 --> 13:31.894
SO WE TALKED A LITTLE,

13:31.936 --> 13:35.482
THEN WE LEFT AT THE SAME TIME.

13:31.936 --> 13:35.482
THAT WAS IT. IT WAS BY ACCIDENT.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.609
YEAH.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.609
This is an old subject,

13:35.523 --> 13:37.609
Jess.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.902
YOU KNOW THAT

13:37.651 --> 13:39.902
WE'RE FRIENDLY.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.902
I KNOW YOU'RE FRIENDLY

13:39.944 --> 13:41.946
THAT DOESN'T MEAN

13:39.944 --> 13:41.946
I DON'T WANNA PUNCH HIM.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.991
THIS WAS NOT A PLAN.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.991
I WAS KIDNAPPED BY MISS PATTY.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.451
SO WAS HE.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.451
THAT'S IT.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.161
THEN YOU TWO SHOULD

13:46.493 --> 13:48.161
PRESS CHARGES.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.621
I THINK WE SHOULD.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.790
JUST...

13:49.663 --> 13:51.790
WHAT?

13:51.830 --> 13:56.461
TELL ME THESE THINGS FIRST

13:51.830 --> 13:56.461
SO I DON'T HAVE TO READ ABOUT

13:51.830 --> 13:56.461
THEM ON TELEPHONE POLES.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.671
I WILL. I PROMISE.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.464
OKAY.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.674
SO, HOW'S THE SHOW?

14:00.715 --> 14:02.634
IT'S GONNA NEED A LOT

14:00.715 --> 14:02.634
OF POSTAGE.

14:02.676 --> 14:06.137
WHY DOES IT SAY, "NOT IN ANY WAY

14:02.676 --> 14:06.137
AFFILIATED WITH KIRK"?

14:06.179 --> 14:08.515
THEY HAD A SHOWBIZ SPAT.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.515
FILL ME IN.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.519
HELP YOURSELVES TO DRINKS

14:11.184 --> 14:12.519
IN THE FRIDGE.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.270
WE'VE GOT CHIPS, PRETZELS,

14:12.560 --> 14:14.270
AND, BRIAN,

14:14.312 --> 14:16.564
I REMEMBERED YOUR ALLERGIES,

14:14.312 --> 14:16.564
SO HERE'S YOUR MELBA TOAST.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.441
THANKS.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.441
WE GOT A LOT DONE TODAY.

14:18.483 --> 14:21.235
WE'VE ALMOST GOT A FULL SET.

14:18.483 --> 14:21.235
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE MISSING?

14:21.277 --> 14:22.654
A STRAIGHT-AHEAD LOVE SONG.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.698
ALL OUR SONGS ARE ABOUT PROPERTY

14:22.696 --> 14:24.698
DESTRUCTION

14:24.739 --> 14:26.491
AND A GENERAL DISLIKE

14:24.739 --> 14:26.491
OF RIGHT-WING CAUSES.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.826
NOT ONE LOVE SONG, HUH?

14:27.867 --> 14:30.161
I THINK WE COULD ADD ONE OR TWO.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.998
YOU'D THINK LOVE SONGS ARE ALL

14:30.203 --> 14:33.998
YOU AND LANE WOULD WANNA PLAY.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.998
[ POTATO CHIP CRUNCHES ]

14:34.040 --> 14:38.252
MAN! THIS CRUNCH JUST NOW

14:34.040 --> 14:38.252
SOUNDED LIKE THE DRUM FILL

14:34.040 --> 14:38.252
IN "BABA O'RILEY."

14:38.294 --> 14:41.798
COOL. WAY TO GO, ZACK.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.798
YEAH, ZACK, A MUSICAL MOUTH.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.798
THAT'S AWESOME.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.967
BUT WHY WOULD DAVE AND LANE

14:41.840 --> 14:44.967
WANNA PLAY JUST LOVE SONGS?

14:45.009 --> 14:47.178
BECAUSE, I WAS JUST THINKING,

14:45.009 --> 14:47.178
YOU KNOW,

14:47.220 --> 14:48.971
WITH DAVE'S NAME -- DAVE --

14:49.013 --> 14:51.516
YOU'VE GOT THE LAST TWO LETTERS

14:49.013 --> 14:51.516
IN "LOVE" -- "V," "E."

14:51.558 --> 14:53.309
WITH LANE'S NAME --

14:51.558 --> 14:53.309
YOU HAVE THE "L,"

14:53.351 --> 14:56.396
THEN YOU DUMP THE "ANE"

14:53.351 --> 14:56.396
AND ADD AN "O." THERE YOU GO.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.272
MAKES SENSE.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.272
TOTALLY.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.067
LET'S START

14:58.314 --> 15:01.067
BREAKING STUFF DOWN.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.067
I GOTTA GET HOME FOR DINNER.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.861
SOON, YOU WON'T

15:01.108 --> 15:02.861
GO HOME FOR DINNER.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.154
WHAT, I'LL BE DEAD?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.154
NO, WE'LL BE ON TOUR!

15:05.196 --> 15:06.573
RIGHT, RIGHT.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.324
THAT WAS A NEGATIVE

15:06.614 --> 15:08.324
"RIGHT, RIGHT," MAN.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.707
GUYS, I'M SO SORRY.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.707
IT JUST SLIPPED OUT.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.707
THAT'S OKAY.

15:15.749 --> 15:18.376
LUCKILY, ZACK AND BRIAN

15:15.749 --> 15:18.376
ARE, WELL, ZACK AND BRIAN.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.713
HOW LONG WILL YOU

15:18.418 --> 15:21.713
KEEP IT A SECRET?

15:18.418 --> 15:21.713
FOR A WHILE. IT'S EASIER.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.798
YOU SURE IT'D BE BAD

15:21.755 --> 15:23.798
IF THEY KNEW?

15:23.840 --> 15:25.675
KEEPING THIS A SECRET

15:23.840 --> 15:25.675
SEEMS AWFULLY COMPLICATED.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.260
NOT REALLY,

15:25.717 --> 15:27.260
WE'VE GOT A SYSTEM.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.637
SPEAKING OF WHICH...

15:27.301 --> 15:29.637
IT'S 3:18.

15:29.679 --> 15:32.432
WE'LL HAVE THE STUFF PACKED

15:29.679 --> 15:32.432
BY 3:40. WHAT'S THE SITUATION?

15:32.473 --> 15:35.226
AT 3:40, MY MOM WILL GO

15:32.473 --> 15:35.226
TO THE YARN STORE

15:35.268 --> 15:37.771
FOR HER BIMONTHLY "SEWATHON"

15:35.268 --> 15:37.771
WITH LACY SCHWARTZ AND BICK HO.

15:37.812 --> 15:39.230
THE STORE'S ON PEACH?

15:37.812 --> 15:39.230
PLUM.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.775
THAT CUTS US OFF FROM

15:39.272 --> 15:41.775
OUR ROUTE TO THE INTERSTATE.

15:41.816 --> 15:44.861
THERE'S A BACK ROAD. BUT IT'S

15:41.816 --> 15:44.861
GONNA BE MUDDY FROM THE RAINS.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.905
I'LL HAVE THE GUYS

15:44.903 --> 15:46.905
TAKE THE USUAL ROUTE.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.616
I'LL WALK TO PEACH,

15:46.946 --> 15:49.616
DOWN THE ALLEY, OVER THE FENCE,

15:49.657 --> 15:51.910
THEY CAN PICK ME UP

15:49.657 --> 15:51.910
BY THE SHELL STATION.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.620
PERFECT.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.415
UH, THAT'S NOT COMPLICATED.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.415
MM.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.251
SORRY I DOUBTED YOU.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.251
OKAY, THEN.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.673
HEY!

16:05.715 --> 16:07.550
HEY, COFFEE?

16:05.715 --> 16:07.550
PLEASE, AND HURRY.

16:07.592 --> 16:10.637
I'M GOING TO MANHATTAN, AND I

16:07.592 --> 16:10.637
NEED TO SHOP FOR WARM CLOTHES.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.012
YOU ALREADY HAVE

16:10.678 --> 16:12.012
WARM CLOTHES.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.765
I HAVE NOTHING.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.765
WE'RE IN CONNECTICUT.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.809
IT GETS FREEZING HERE,

16:13.807 --> 16:15.809
SAME AS NEW YORK.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.727
IT'S NOT'S THE SAME.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.727
EXACTLY THE SAME.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.103
I HAVE NOTHING STYLISH ENOUGH.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.647
YOU GOT THE BLACK CASHMERE COAT.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.189
IT NEEDS CLEANING.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.189
SO, CLEAN IT.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.609
I NEED SWEATERS, TOO.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.609
YOU'VE GOT THE PURPLE,

16:24.651 --> 16:27.403
THE POWDER BLUE,

16:24.651 --> 16:27.403
THREE SHADES OF RED,

16:24.651 --> 16:27.403
A TON OF BLACK,

16:27.445 --> 16:29.196
WHICH WILL ALL GO

16:27.445 --> 16:29.196
WITH THAT COAT,

16:29.238 --> 16:31.491
YOU'VE GOT A DOZEN SCARVES

16:29.238 --> 16:31.491
TO MIX AND MATCH

16:31.532 --> 16:34.285
WITH ANY OF THOSE TOPS.

16:31.532 --> 16:34.285
LET ME SHOP FOR SOME CLOTHES.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.537
OKAY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING

16:34.327 --> 16:36.537
IN NEW YORK?

16:36.579 --> 16:40.207
UM, A BUNCH OF US ARE GOING.

16:36.579 --> 16:40.207
IT'LL BE DINNER AND A SHOW.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.376
WHAT SHOW?

16:40.249 --> 16:42.376
"LEVITTOWN." IT'S A NEW MUSICAL.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.296
IT'S IN PREVIEWS.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.296
DOESN'T OFFICIALLY OPEN

16:42.418 --> 16:45.296
FOR A COUPLE WEEKS.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.465
WOW, SO INFORMED.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.465
NICOLE LIKES THE THEATER.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.425
HER FIRM HAS

16:47.507 --> 16:49.425
AN OFFICE ON MADISON.

16:49.467 --> 16:52.219
I'VE MET HER THERE

16:49.467 --> 16:52.219
A COUPLE TIMES.

16:49.467 --> 16:52.219
SAW "HAIRSPRAY" LAST WEEK.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.013
I CANNOT PICTURE YOU

16:52.261 --> 16:54.013
WATCHING "HAIRSPRAY."

16:54.054 --> 16:55.431
I LIKED

16:54.054 --> 16:55.431
"THE PRODUCERS" BETTER.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.016
AREN'T YOU JUST
