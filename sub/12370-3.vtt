JOY, HONEY,
YOU HAVE GOT TO CALM DOWN.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.773

I'M NERVOUS ENOUGH
THAT SIMON'S COMING TO SEE ME,

BUT HE'S ALSO
MEETING HIS SON

00:27.861 --> 00:30.113

ELKA AND I ARE GOING
DOCTOR SHOPPING TODAY.

01:02.979 --> 01:04.147

01:12.405 --> 01:14.491
- ACADEMY?
IT'S A PRE-SCHOOL.

01:14.574 --> 01:18.870

I JUST DON'T WANT HIM
TO BE TOO CLEVELAND.

I'M SURE PRE-SCHOOLS
WERE DIFFERENT IN YOUR DAY.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.480

- WHERE'S WILBUR,
OR HIS FATHER FOR THAT MATTER?

10:03.561 --> 10:05.563
- WILBUR IS ON
AN EDUCATIONAL ADVENTURE

10:05.646 --> 10:07.606
WITH HIS AUNT VICTORIA,

10:07.690 --> 10:09.483

FROM A BUSINESS TRIP.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.152
HE SHOULD BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

10:11.235 --> 10:12.737

- MY BOY!
IT'S YOU!

10:22.288 --> 10:26.125
- WHY ARE YOU HUGGING
MY ASSISTANT?

10:26.208 --> 10:29.045
- BECAUSE SAYING "MY BOY"
AND THEN GIVING A HUG

10:29.128 --> 10:31.172
IS A STANDARD GREETING
IN SCOTLAND...

10:31.255 --> 10:35.051
TO A YOUNG MAN...
YOU'VE JUST MET.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.886
- OWEN BURR IS HERE.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.012
- SEND HIM IN.

10:42.016 --> 10:45.853
- OH, MY GOD.
IT'S YOU.

10:45.936 --> 10:47.813
- HI, DAD.

10:51.692 --> 10:54.904
- THIS IS MY SON!

10:54.987 --> 10:57.406
- NOW, SIMON.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.241
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN OWEN

10:59.325 --> 11:00.368
COME BACK
FROM A BUSINESS TRIP BEFORE.

11:00.451 --> 11:02.411
- OF COURSE!

11:02.495 --> 11:04.288
IT'S HAPPENED MANY TIMES,

11:04.372 --> 11:07.083
BUT EACH TIME IT DOES,
IT'S JUST SO AMAZING.

11:07.166 --> 11:10.002
- I'M DR. CARSON,
HEADMISTRESS.

11:10.086 --> 11:10.878
WHY DON'T WE ALL
HAVE A SEAT?

11:14.173 --> 11:15.883
- HE'S CREEPING ME OUT.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.927
- SUCK IT UP.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.388
WE ARE A HAPPY FAMILY,
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOREVER,

11:20.471 --> 11:22.390
AND WE LOVE EACH OTHER
VERY MUCH.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.058
- SO, OWEN, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT

11:24.141 --> 11:26.060
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY DYNAMIC?

11:26.143 --> 11:29.563
- WELL, WE'RE A HAPPY FAMILY,
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOREVER,

11:29.647 --> 11:32.274
AND WE LOVE EACH OTHER
VERY MUCH.

11:32.358 --> 11:36.404
- BEAUTIFULLY PUT.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.155
- HE'S GOT
HIS GRANDMOTHER'S EYES.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.116
TO THINK I MIGHT NEVER
HAVE SEEN THEM.

11:40.199 --> 11:45.162
- IF OWEN'S PLANE
HAD CRASHED.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.873
WE BRITS ALWAYS
EXPECT THE WORST.

11:50.167 --> 11:55.798
I'M EXPECTING IT NOW.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.091
- SO, UH, HOW LONG YOU BEEN
ON J-DATE?

11:57.174 --> 11:59.802
- UH, A WEEK.

11:59.885 --> 12:03.180
I REMEMBER BECAUSE
I WAS HAVING A BRISKET,

12:03.264 --> 12:07.643
AND I SAID TO MY FRIEND RUCHEL,
"WHAT COULD IT HURT?"

12:07.726 --> 12:10.020
- AND HOW OBSERVANT
ARE YOU?

12:10.104 --> 12:15.151
- OBSERVANT ENOUGH TO SEE
THAT YOU ARE QUITE A CATCH.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.945
A DOCTOR!

12:18.028 --> 12:19.947
SO WHAT IS YOUR SPECIALTY,
I'M WONDERING?

12:20.030 --> 12:21.657
- [laughs]
BRAIN TUMORS.

12:21.740 --> 12:24.910
- OF WHICH I HAVE ONE!

12:24.994 --> 12:28.581
MAYBE WE COULD GET TOGETHER
SOMETIME IN YOUR OFFICE

12:28.664 --> 12:30.875
FOR A NOSH
OR A CONSULTATION MAYBE.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.918
- OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.170
YOU'RE THE MELANIE
WHO'S BEEN PESTERING MY OFFICE

12:34.253 --> 12:35.629
FOR AN APPOINTMENT.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.339
YOU'RE NOT EVEN JEWISH!

12:37.423 --> 12:39.508
- BUT I'M SO CLOSE!
I'M ITALIAN.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.261
- LOOK, I'VE GOT
TOO MANY PATIENTS AS IT IS.

12:42.344 --> 12:44.013
I'M HERE BECAUSE
MY THERAPIST WANTS ME

12:44.096 --> 12:45.973
TO BUILD A LIFE
OUTSIDE MY PRACTICE.

12:46.056 --> 12:48.017
- SO HIM YOU LISTEN TO
AND NOT ME?

12:48.100 --> 12:49.977
- STOP DOING THAT!

12:50.060 --> 12:53.856
I'M LEAVING.

12:53.939 --> 12:57.818
- [sighs]

12:57.902 --> 12:59.904
I KNOW WHAT IT SAYS, ELKA.

13:03.782 --> 13:06.160
- IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
OPEN IT.

13:06.243 --> 13:10.039
- "I TOLD YOU SO."

13:10.122 --> 13:11.790
- THERE'S SOMETHING
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

13:15.252 --> 13:17.129
- "SEE OTHER SIDE."

13:25.638 --> 13:26.889
- SO, MR. BURR,
YOU'RE A SINGLE PARENT

13:26.972 --> 13:28.682
WHO TRAVELS FREQUENTLY?

13:28.766 --> 13:30.059
- OH, DON'T WORRY.
WILBUR'S MY LIFE.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.936
I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE DADS

13:32.019 --> 13:33.395
WHO GOES DECADES
WITHOUT SEEING THEIR KID.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.231
THAT'S NOT ME.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.024
- NOR ME, ANYMORE.

13:37.107 --> 13:41.278
IF IT EVER WAS.

13:41.362 --> 13:45.115
- WE ALL LOVE HOLDING HANDS
SO MUCH.

13:45.199 --> 13:49.745
- AH.

13:49.828 --> 13:52.373
- BUT LET'S REMEMBER,
WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT WILBUR.

13:52.456 --> 13:56.252
- HE'S A GREAT KID.
HE'S FRIENDLY, DOWN TO EARTH.

13:56.335 --> 13:59.129
JUST YOUR TYPICAL, RED-BLOODED,
ALL-AMERICAN BOY.

13:59.213 --> 14:02.800
- SAY HELLO
TO PRINCE CHARMING!

14:07.805 --> 14:09.473
- WILBUR!

14:09.557 --> 14:13.102
HEY THERE, BUD.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

14:13.185 --> 14:14.770
- I WON!

14:14.853 --> 14:16.272
- OH, HE CERTAINLY DID.
[laughs]

14:16.355 --> 14:18.232
I'M SORRY WE'RE LATE,

14:18.315 --> 14:20.276
BUT YOU HAVE ONE
VERY SPECIAL APPLICANT HERE.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.278
HE MADE THOSE OTHER CONTESTANTS
LOOK LIKE BABIES...

14:22.361 --> 14:24.113
[laughs]

14:24.196 --> 14:26.782
WHICH, TO BE FAIR,
MOST OF THEM WERE.

14:26.865 --> 14:28.993
- WILBUR,
YOU'RE GONNA GO OFF WITH ANDY

14:29.076 --> 14:31.245
AND YOU'RE GONNA PLAY SOME GAMES
AND ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS.

14:31.328 --> 14:33.497
- OH, IT'S THE TALENT PORTION.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.457
- OKEY-DOKEY!

14:35.541 --> 14:37.376
- ALL RIGHT,
JUST DIAL IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.255
- ALL RIGHT, NOW THAT WE'RE ALL
FINALLY HERE,

14:41.338 --> 14:43.591
LET'S BEGIN.

14:43.674 --> 14:46.093
- VICTORIA DOESN'T HAVE TO STAY,
DOES SHE?

14:46.176 --> 14:47.970
- SHE'S PART OF YOUR
SUPPORT SYSTEM, ISN'T SHE?

14:48.053 --> 14:50.139
- YES, I AM.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.308
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
I AM HAPPY TO USE MY CELEBRITY

14:52.391 --> 14:55.352
TO HELP THE SCHOOL
IN ANY WAY.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.354
- I'M SORRY,
WHO EXACTLY ARE YOU?

14:57.438 --> 14:59.148
- I'M VICTORIA CHASE.

14:59.231 --> 15:02.985
- AND WHAT DO YOU DO?

15:03.068 --> 15:05.195
- I'M A VERY FAMOUS ACTRESS.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.364
- ALL RIGHT.

15:07.448 --> 15:10.367
OKAY,
LET'S TALK ABOUT FAMILY.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.494
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY,
YOU KNOW,

15:12.578 --> 15:13.829
IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT CHILDREN
HAVE ADULTS WHO CARE.

15:13.912 --> 15:15.956
- I ABSOLUTELY AGREE.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.499
THAT'S WHY I MADE SURE
WILBUR HAS THAT.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.501
- SPEAKING OF CARING, OWEN,

15:19.585 --> 15:22.171
I READ AN ARTICLE THAT SAID
THAT SOME FATHERS

15:22.254 --> 15:24.340
BUILD STRONG BONDS
WITH THEIR CHILDREN

15:24.423 --> 15:26.008
DESPITE BEING ABSENT
MANY YEARS.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.801
- IT PROBABLY DREW
YOUR ATTENTION

15:27.885 --> 15:29.053
BECAUSE OF ITS LACK
OF SIMILARITIES

15:29.136 --> 15:31.347
TO OUR OWN SITUATION.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.307
- I READ A DIFFERENT ARTICLE

15:33.390 --> 15:35.392
THAT SAID ADULT CHILDREN
OF ABSENT FATHERS

15:35.476 --> 15:37.353
AREN'T THAT INTERESTED
IN BUILDING A BOND.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.229
- ALTHOUGH ALL THAT READING
DIDN'T STOP THEM

15:39.313 --> 15:42.441
FROM ENJOYING AMERICA'S
FAVORITE PASTIME, TELEVISION.

15:44.777 --> 15:48.030
HAVE I WON AN EMMY?
WHY, YES, I HAVE.

15:51.575 --> 15:53.410
- BUT TODAY IS ABOUT WILBUR.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.288
- WELL, I HOPE WILBUR WON'T
BE WATCHING MUCH TELEVISION.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.832
WE PREFER OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES
FOR OUR CHILDREN.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.751
- WILBUR AND I LIKE
TO GO FISHING.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.711
- I LOVE FISHING!
WE SHOULD GO THIS WEEKEND!

16:02.795 --> 16:04.546
- YOU KNOW,
I PLAYED A FISH OUT OF WATER

16:04.630 --> 16:06.423
IN THE FORTHCOMING
WOODY ALLEN MOVIE.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.425
SURELY YOU HAVE HEARD OF HIM?

16:08.509 --> 16:10.844
- I'VE HEARD OF HIM.
I DO NOT APPROVE OF HIM.

16:10.928 --> 16:14.348
- [mocking] "I'VE HEARD OF HIM.
I DO NOT APPROVE OF HIM."

16:14.431 --> 16:16.058
- LOOK, IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO FISHING,

16:16.141 --> 16:17.267
WE COULD ALWAYS GO
SKEET SHOOTING.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.019
- I DON'T LIKE GUNS.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.771
- BARBEQUE?
- I DON'T EAT MEAT.

16:20.854 --> 16:22.773
- HUNTING?
- THAT'S GUNS <i> AND</i> MEAT.

16:22.856 --> 16:24.566
LOOK, I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.694
THIS IS JUST SO WEIRD.

16:26.777 --> 16:29.029
- IT-IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE, SON.

16:29.113 --> 16:31.073
- DUDE, BACK OFF.
I JUST MET YOU!

16:32.866 --> 16:35.285
- WHAT IS GOING ON?

16:35.369 --> 16:38.414
- OH, BLOODY HELL.
I GIVE UP.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.417
THE TRUTH IS
SIMON GOT ME PREGNANT

16:41.500 --> 16:43.127
WHEN WE WERE VERY YOUNG,

16:43.210 --> 16:44.920
AND I GAVE UP OWEN
FOR ADOPTION.

16:45.003 --> 16:46.588
OWEN AND I RECONNECTED
A FEW YEARS AGO,

16:46.672 --> 16:48.424
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

16:48.507 --> 16:50.926
SIMON'S EVER
LAID EYES ON HIM.

16:51.009 --> 16:53.429
LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS A BIG MESS
BUT PLEASE,

16:53.512 --> 16:55.639
DON'T JUDGE THE CHILD
BY THE FAMILY.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.599
- AND, YOU KNOW,
THAT IS AN OFFICIAL RULE

16:57.683 --> 16:59.768
OF THE LITTLE
PRINCE CHARMING PAGEANT.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.938
- WAIT A MINUTE.
I DO RECOGNIZE YOU.

17:03.021 --> 17:05.315
- OH, THANK YOU.

17:05.398 --> 17:08.234
- I WAS TRAVELLING IN ASIA
LAST YEAR.

17:08.318 --> 17:11.320
YOU'RE THE FACE
OF INCONTINENCE!

17:11.405 --> 17:13.323
YOU'RE MRS. LADYPANTS!

17:17.536 --> 17:19.413
- WILL THAT HELP WILBUR GET
INTO YOUR SCHOOL?

17:19.496 --> 17:21.457
- NOT AT ALL.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.583
- THEN I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.465
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.175
I CAN'T FIND THE RIGHT DOCTOR.
- YEAH.

17:31.258 --> 17:32.926
WHEN MY FIRST MARRIAGE
FELL APART,

17:33.010 --> 17:34.970
I HAD TROUBLE
CHOOSING A LAWYER

17:35.053 --> 17:36.805
BECAUSE SUBCONSCIOUSLY,
ONCE I CHOSE ONE

17:36.889 --> 17:38.307
IT WOULD MEAN THAT I WAS REALLY
GETTING DIVORCED.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.810
- AND IF I CHOOSE A DOCTOR

17:41.894 --> 17:44.146
IT MEANS I REALLY HAVE
A BRAIN TUMOR.

17:46.064 --> 17:48.942
AND I DO,
SO I WILL CHOOSE ONE.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.861
- WELL, WHOEVER YOU CHOOSE,

17:50.944 --> 17:52.821
I MEAN, WE'RE GOING
THROUGH THIS WITH YOU.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.949
SO CHOOSE A HANDSOME ONE.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.330
- YEAH,
MAYBE I'M IN DENIAL TOO,

18:01.413 --> 18:07.169
USING WILBUR'S PAGEANTS AS
A DISTRACTION FROM MY PROBLEMS.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.630
YOU KNOW, WHETHER OR NOT
I EVER SEE EMMET AGAIN,

18:09.713 --> 18:12.883
I NEED TO JUST MOVE ON
WITH MY LIFE.

18:12.966 --> 18:15.052
WELL,
AFTER WILBUR WINS STATE.

18:17.554 --> 18:19.014
- HEY, HOW COME WE HAVE
SO MUCH WINE LEFT?

18:19.097 --> 18:21.099
- JOY'S ON THE PORCH.

18:24.102 --> 18:26.730
- ALL RIGHT.
SO WILBUR DIDN'T GET IN.

18:26.814 --> 18:30.150
WE'LL GET HIM A BOX
AND A POTATO.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.152
I HATED
THAT PRE-SCHOOL ANYWAY.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.862
- ME TOO.
- ME TOO.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.864
- OF COURSE,
WE'RE ONLY SAYING THAT

18:35.948 --> 18:37.866
'CAUSE HE NEVER GOT IN.
- OF COURSE.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.868
- IT'S A GREAT PRE-SCHOOL.
- IT WAS MAGNIFICENT!

18:39.952 --> 18:43.372
THEY HAD AN OLYMPIC-SIZED POOL.
IT WAS ONLY TWO-FEET DEEP!

18:43.455 --> 18:46.959
- WE'VE TAKEN PERFECT FAMILY
OFF THE TABLE,

18:47.042 --> 18:48.836
BUT MAYBE
WE CAN BE SOMETHING.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.921
- I'D LIKE THAT.

18:51.004 --> 18:53.382
LOOK, WE MIGHT NOT BE
THE FIRST FAMILY

18:53.465 --> 18:55.217
THAT STARTED OUT
WITH A BROKEN CONDOM

18:55.300 --> 18:56.552
BEHIND THE BINS
OF A FISH AND CHIP SHOP,

18:56.635 --> 19:00.097
BUT WE CAN BE THE BEST!

19:00.180 --> 19:02.057
- [sighs]

19:02.140 --> 19:03.392
LOOK, YOU SEEM
LIKE A DECENT GUY NOW,

19:03.475 --> 19:05.227
BUT IT'S HARD TO GET OVER

19:05.310 --> 19:06.562
ALL THOSE AWFUL THINGS
YOU'VE DONE.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.438
- ABANDONING YOUR MOTHER?

19:08.522 --> 19:12.442
- YEAH, AND THE DRUG DEALING
AND THE ARSON.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.486
- WHAT?
I NEVER DID THOSE THINGS.

19:16.905 --> 19:18.574
- WHEN I FIRST MET OWEN,

19:18.657 --> 19:20.951
I MAY HAVE TOLD HIM
A FEW WHITE LIES

19:21.034 --> 19:23.704
SO HE'D HATE YOU
AS MUCH AS I DID.

19:23.787 --> 19:26.206
PLUS, I'D JUST SHOT HIM

19:26.290 --> 19:29.626
AND I WANTED HIM TO BE
ON MY SIDE.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.044
- YOU SHOT HIM?

19:31.128 --> 19:32.921
- YOU LIED TO ME?

19:33.005 --> 19:35.716
- OH, LOOK AT US.
[laughs]

19:35.799 --> 19:37.926
OH, WE MAY HAVE JUST MET,

19:38.010 --> 19:39.553
BUT WE ALREADY HAVE
A LOT OF BAGGAGE.

19:39.636 --> 19:43.432
WE ARE A REAL FAMILY.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.642
- ALL RIGHT.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.436
HOW ABOUT
WE GO FISHING TOMORROW?

19:47.519 --> 19:49.563
- I'D LIKE THAT.

19:49.646 --> 19:52.274
WE CAN TAKE WILBUR.
WE CAN USE HIS SEQUINS AS LURES.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.443
- SPEAKING OF WILBUR,

19:54.526 --> 19:56.945
I NEED TO GO UPSTAIRS AND MAKE
SURE HE BRUSHES HIS TEETH...

19:57.029 --> 19:59.656
AND TAKES OFF HIS MAKEUP.

20:03.869 --> 20:04.953
- WE MADE A GOOD KID,
DIDN'T WE?

20:05.037 --> 20:07.122
- WE SURE DID.

20:07.205 --> 20:09.124
- YOU KNOW,
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THIS,

20:09.207 --> 20:12.002
BUT DO YOU WANT
TO GO TO BED, GRANDMA?

20:12.085 --> 20:14.963
- I SURE WOULD, GRANDPA.

20:15.047 --> 20:19.468
- WORST DIRTY TALK EVER.

20:19.551 --> 20:22.221
- OH, SHUT UP AND KISS ME.
