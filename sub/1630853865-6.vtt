We can't just leave Bode here.

[panting]

00:18.059 --> 00:19.769
We're gonna come back for him.

00:19.853 --> 00:23.231
It just isn't safe right now, okay?
We have to keep going.

The light from behind the Black Door.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.081
Why would it come from Keyhouse?

Yeah. I'm f-fine.

These are not all the keys.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.232
The Lockes kept one.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.652
I can feel its absence.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.405
Hunt them down. Find it.

01:55.406 --> 01:56.783
They could be anywhere.

01:57.742 --> 01:59.244
Start with the historian.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.204
He knows the mother.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.582
He'll show you where they've gone

Chamberlin, Gideon.

02:36.197 --> 02:38.992
He's going after my family.
I need to warn them!

02:39.075 --> 02:42.745
I'm sorry, Bode, but you're confined
to Keyhouse grounds.

02:43.329 --> 02:46.749
But I can't just stay around
and do nothing.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.752
There are still things you can do
even when you're a ghost.

02:51.796 --> 02:53.214
What are you doing here?

02:53.298 --> 02:55.884
When I was in your house,
the cops showed up.

02:55.967 --> 02:59.929
I tried to flee, but I didn't realize
I was running through the Ghost Door.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.264
When it closed…

03:01.806 --> 03:03.725
You got cut off from your body.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.560
Just like you did.

03:05.643 --> 03:07.562
Don't try and pretend we're the same.

03:07.645 --> 03:09.147
I know that you hate me,

03:09.230 --> 03:11.441
and I'm the last person
that you wanna talk to,

03:11.524 --> 03:13.568
but Dodge did this to both of us.

03:13.651 --> 03:14.694
No!

03:14.777 --> 03:16.821
You killed my dad.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.616
-Now leave me alone!
-I can help.

03:19.699 --> 03:22.368
I don't wanna see your face ever again.

03:23.703 --> 03:24.829
Go! Now!

03:31.211 --> 03:34.088
I would never defend the things
that Sam did.

03:35.256 --> 03:37.967
But I want you to know
he has sought to atone.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.845
He's aided your family before,

03:42.055 --> 03:43.306
though you never knew it.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.016
What are you talking about?

03:46.893 --> 03:47.977
Ask him.

[phone chiming]

04:06.996 --> 04:08.706
[exhales, chuckles gently]

04:11.000 --> 04:12.001
Hi.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.170
-[Josh] Hey. I didn't wake you, did I?
-[Nina] No.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.006
No, I was awake.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.841
[Josh] Oh, great. Well, I just, um…

04:18.925 --> 04:20.551
Hadn't spoken since the dinner.

04:20.635 --> 04:24.222
Just calling to see how
Bode's stomach issue resolved.

04:24.305 --> 04:27.809
Oh, um, yeah. Yeah, he's fine.

04:27.892 --> 04:29.060
That's great.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.729
Not exactly surprising, right?

04:33.022 --> 04:37.485
Uh, so I was thinking
it's… it's possible that we may have

04:38.861 --> 04:40.655
included the kids too soon.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.616
I'm not saying that you and I
should do anything different.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.118
I think you and I should keep…

04:45.201 --> 04:46.035
[inhales sharply]

04:46.119 --> 04:47.996
…doing exactly what we're doing.

04:48.079 --> 04:50.456
Just maybe keep the kids separate.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.293
At least for the time being.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.340
Uh, I could come over there
and talk about this in person if you want.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.843
No, uh, I'm not even there. I'm…

05:02.844 --> 05:04.804
I'm at Ellie's having coffee,

05:04.887 --> 05:07.974
so, uh, I can't really talk.

05:08.057 --> 05:11.394
Oh, okay. Um, sure.
Yeah, you get back to it, then.

05:11.477 --> 05:12.895
Yeah, I… I should.

05:13.563 --> 05:14.981
[Josh] Give me a call later, okay?

05:15.064 --> 05:16.649
Yeah, okay. Bye.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.152
Bye.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.283
[exhales]

05:25.366 --> 05:27.243
I hate having to lie to him.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.079
What other choice is there?

05:31.664 --> 05:33.458
This must be how Rendell felt.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.464
He must have been so lonely.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.760
Except for, in your case,

05:44.719 --> 05:45.928
you're not alone.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.850
[birds squawking]

05:53.603 --> 05:56.314
If we could get the Timeshift Key back,
maybe we could change--

05:56.397 --> 05:57.607
No.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.609
No, th-that's not how it works.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.945
It's too unpredictable.
It could just as easily make things worse.

06:03.654 --> 06:06.240
The only answer is
to somehow get the Ghost Key back.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.534
It's the only way we can save Bode.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.703
Then we can figure out
a way to stop Gideon.

06:10.787 --> 06:14.874
So, we're just gonna lift the Ghost Key
off this super powerful demon?

06:15.541 --> 06:16.667
How's that gonna work?

06:16.751 --> 06:19.170
I don't know. Let's figure something out.

06:19.253 --> 06:22.548
Without us having any keys or any magic--

06:22.632 --> 06:26.219
Do you have anything to contribute,
or are you here to shoot things down?

06:26.302 --> 06:29.430
I'm just trying to--
You know what? Forget it.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.232
Diversion is a common military tactic,

06:39.315 --> 06:41.692
using a ruse
to shift the enemy's attention.

06:42.318 --> 06:43.694
And how would that work?

06:43.778 --> 06:46.739
We find a way to distract Gideon,
then get the Ghost Key back.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.659
[Tyler] Even if we get the Ghost Key
and open the door,

06:49.742 --> 06:52.662
it doesn't mean anything
if Bode doesn't have a body to fly into.

06:52.745 --> 06:55.039
[contemplative music playing]

06:55.123 --> 06:57.041
So, what if he did have a body?

06:57.750 --> 06:59.377
But whose body?

07:00.336 --> 07:02.338
[music continues]

07:10.596 --> 07:12.390
How'd your talk with Nina go?

07:13.433 --> 07:14.934
Shouldn't you be reading?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.062
Aren't we going over to Keyhouse?

07:18.146 --> 07:21.023
Nina is at Ellie's house.
So, no, we're not.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.610
You know,
I've been calling and texting Bode.

07:24.694 --> 07:25.778
No response.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.488
Maybe he needs some space.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.241
Maybe they both do.

07:30.867 --> 07:31.701
What?

07:31.784 --> 07:32.785
Nothing.

07:34.912 --> 07:36.038

07:56.934 --> 07:58.603
[grunting]

07:59.312 --> 08:02.273
You need to tell me
where I can find Nina Locke.

-I don't have any idea.
-Bollocks.

08:06.569 --> 08:07.862
[grunts]

08:07.945 --> 08:11.491
Tell me, or I'll shoot you in the gut
and let you bleed out.

08:13.826 --> 08:16.204
[Josh] What do…
What do you want with Nina Locke?

08:17.330 --> 08:18.748
[Bolton] She's got a key I need.

08:20.082 --> 08:21.918
A key, huh? Wha-- To what?

08:22.960 --> 08:24.295
Maybe I can help.

08:24.378 --> 08:25.463
Enough.

08:26.255 --> 08:29.342
I'm going to ask you one last time.

08:29.425 --> 08:31.552
[tense music playing]

08:33.012 --> 08:33.930

08:41.646 --> 08:44.482

08:45.107 --> 08:46.317
Don't move!

08:46.400 --> 08:48.319
Stop, or I'll shoot.

08:48.402 --> 08:49.487
Fire away.

08:49.570 --> 08:50.571
[Josh] Last warning.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.575

Sorry.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.095
[panting] Well. Look at this.

[Jamie grunting]

09:15.680 --> 09:16.973
[Bolton] That's your father, huh?

-[Jamie] Help! Dad!
-[Josh grunting]

09:19.809 --> 09:21.185
He's still alive.

09:21.269 --> 09:24.772
If you can take me to your friends,
he'll stay that way.

09:24.855 --> 09:26.649
-Yeah?
-[Jamie muffled] Okay, okay!

09:26.732 --> 09:27.608
Good.

09:28.359 --> 09:29.277
And you,

09:29.360 --> 09:33.155
if I see any sign
you've called the local constabulary,

09:33.239 --> 09:34.574
your daughter dies.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.409
Help! Help!

09:36.492 --> 09:39.036
-[Josh] Jamie! [groans]
-[muffled yell] Dad! Someone!

09:40.121 --> 09:40.997
[groans]

09:54.552 --> 09:57.096
Those don't belong to you,
and we're gonna get them back.

[foreboding music playing]

10:19.160 --> 10:21.162
[birds chirping]

10:25.207 --> 10:27.585
[Bode] I liked it better
when I thought you were dead.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.841
Yeah, sometimes I wish I were.

10:35.551 --> 10:38.596
Just because I'm talking to you
doesn't mean I forgive you.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.181
I don't expect you to.

10:41.557 --> 10:45.728
Dodge may have used me,
but I still made my choices.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.606
[voice breaking]
I can't change what happened,

10:49.190 --> 10:52.026
but I am so sorry that I did what I did.

10:53.694 --> 10:54.862
I'm sorry, Bode.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.949
Chamberlin told me
that you helped my family.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.078
I led Kinsey to the Angel Key.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.371
How?

11:03.454 --> 11:06.207
By using the birds. They, um…

11:07.792 --> 11:11.128
They can sense us.
I figured out a way to guide them.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.129
Birds?

11:12.922 --> 11:14.632
You mean like sparrows?

11:17.218 --> 11:18.636
Show me how you did it.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.598
[door opens]

11:28.521 --> 11:29.563
Not bad.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.733
High praise.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.362
I figured it would be
the first thing Bode would do

11:36.445 --> 11:38.322
to try and find the best way inside.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.700
He always loved a "tactical map."

11:53.003 --> 11:55.214
Hey, I'm sorry
for snapping at you earlier.

11:57.591 --> 11:59.427
The last time I talked to Bode,

12:00.136 --> 12:01.345
actual Bode…

12:04.181 --> 12:05.850
I was kind of a jerk to him.

12:08.352 --> 12:10.187
So if I don't get to talk to him again--

12:10.271 --> 12:13.149
He'll definitely spend
ghost eternity hating you.

12:18.696 --> 12:19.697
We'll work this out.

12:20.698 --> 12:24.034
But don't let your guilt get in the way.

12:25.661 --> 12:26.996
It never helps things.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.498
[solemn music playing]

12:40.926 --> 12:42.219
This feels risky.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.096
We need weapons.

12:47.892 --> 12:48.976
Come with me.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.023
The owners I'm renting from
are carpenters.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.734
I mean, it's not demon strength.

12:56.817 --> 12:59.069
At least it'll help
level the playing field.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.280
[phone chiming]

13:02.364 --> 13:03.616
[tool clatters on table]

13:04.700 --> 13:05.701
[sighs]

13:06.202 --> 13:07.203
[inhales deeply]

13:08.496 --> 13:10.664
Josh, it's not a great time.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.959
[tense music playing]

13:14.043 --> 13:15.961
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

13:17.922 --> 13:18.839
[Nina exhales sharply]

13:21.217 --> 13:23.385
We're gonna get her back.
You have my word.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.763
Yes. Yes.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.057
Okay. See you soon.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.143
Bolton has Jamie.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.896
Josh thinks he's on his way here
now with her.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.106
What? Why?

13:36.190 --> 13:39.235
Josh said he… he mentioned something
about needing a key?

13:39.819 --> 13:41.946
Are there other keys out there
we haven't found?

13:42.029 --> 13:43.489
Not that I know of.

13:43.572 --> 13:46.242
Okay, either way,
Bolton's gonna be here any minute.

13:47.409 --> 13:48.536
This is our way in.

13:48.619 --> 13:51.914
If we can play this right,
we can use the promise of this key

13:51.997 --> 13:54.333
to get Bolton to willingly walk
right through the Ghost Door.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.294
So Bode takes over Bolton's body?

13:57.378 --> 13:59.421
Temporarily, until we stop Gideon.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.715
It's worth a shot, right?

14:05.344 --> 14:07.596
-[dramatic music playing]
-[Jamie whimpering]

14:08.430 --> 14:09.682
[grunting]

14:11.600 --> 14:12.726
[door slams open]

14:12.810 --> 14:14.562
Whoa! Whoa! What the hell?

14:15.187 --> 14:16.272
[Bolton] You.

14:16.814 --> 14:17.898
[panting]

14:17.982 --> 14:20.317
-Give me the key.
-I'm sorry. I… I had to tell him.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.819
-Shut up!
-No, don't!

14:22.403 --> 14:25.948
There's another key.
Hand it over, or she dies.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.283
We don't have it.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.078
-I don't believe you.
-No, he's telling the truth.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.416
Find me rope.

14:35.499 --> 14:37.501
[music continues]

14:46.010 --> 14:47.261
Wait.

14:47.845 --> 14:48.971
What is it now?

14:49.930 --> 14:51.098
Let her go.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.310
I'm the one with the gun.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.437
She doesn't know anything.
She can't help you.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.565
You needed her to find us, and you did.

15:00.524 --> 15:01.609
Let her go.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.988
You've served your purpose.

15:07.364 --> 15:08.198
Go.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.203
Now move.

15:13.704 --> 15:15.706
[music continues]

15:21.462 --> 15:22.421
[Nina] Jamie!

15:22.504 --> 15:25.299
Nina! My dad, he… he got shot,
and then he was on the floor--

15:25.382 --> 15:28.427
It's okay. I just talked to him.
He's on his way over here now.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.811
Are you sure you're okay?
Can I make you a sandwich or something?

15:37.895 --> 15:39.939
Where's Bode?

15:40.814 --> 15:43.984
Um, that's…
that's a little bit hard to explain.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.695
Dodge stole his body.
He's stuck at Keyhouse as a ghost.

15:46.779 --> 15:50.407
Oh shit. Sorry, but that's messed up.

15:50.491 --> 15:53.327
Don't worry.
We've got a plan to bring him back.

15:53.410 --> 15:56.121
So Bode hasn't actually been Bode.

15:56.205 --> 15:59.083
-That makes total sense.
-[knocking on door, door opens]

15:59.166 --> 16:00.834
-[Josh groaning]
-[Nina] Oh.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.503
Jamie? Jamie?

16:02.586 --> 16:04.505
-Josh, your shoulder.
-[Jamie] Dad!

16:05.089 --> 16:08.092
[Josh] Hey.
Hey, are you okay? Did he hurt you?

16:08.175 --> 16:10.886
I'm okay, but what about you?
You're bleeding a lot.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.473
I'm okay. I just need…
I just need to sit down.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.768
-Josh! Josh!
-[Josh groaning]

16:17.851 --> 16:19.103
[Nina exhales sharply]

16:21.522 --> 16:23.816
Go! Fly!

16:23.899 --> 16:25.901
[birds chirping]

16:27.444 --> 16:29.363
The birds feel your energy.

16:29.446 --> 16:32.741
Try to stay calm,
and they'll do what you want them to.

16:32.825 --> 16:33.993
[exhales]

16:35.160 --> 16:37.955
[breathes deeply]

16:54.638 --> 16:57.224
-[birds fluttering]
-[inspirational music playing]

16:59.601 --> 17:01.353
There you go! You're doing it!

17:01.854 --> 17:04.523
[music intensifies]

17:11.488 --> 17:12.740
Mrs. Bennett?

17:12.823 --> 17:15.075
Oh, uh, no, he's not my…

17:15.743 --> 17:17.036
We're friends.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.788
Good news. He's stable and stitched up.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.874
-You can see him now.
-[exhales sharply]

17:24.668 --> 17:26.670
[footsteps approaching]

17:28.130 --> 17:29.048
Hey.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.842
-[groans] Careful. Careful, careful.
-Oh, sorry.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.970
I'm just so happy you're okay.

17:35.054 --> 17:38.098
Yeah. I told them I was cleaning a gun
at the Meeting House,

17:38.182 --> 17:40.768
and it accidentally went off.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.563
Maybe you can tell me the truth.

17:46.106 --> 17:47.649
What the hell happened today?

17:51.361 --> 17:53.906
I'm so sorry you and Jamie
are caught up in all this.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.741
Caught up in what?

17:59.203 --> 18:02.331
Hey, does this have something to do
with the break-in at the wedding?

18:06.085 --> 18:07.628
Nina, if Jamie and I are in danger--

18:07.711 --> 18:11.131
I wanna tell you… everything.

18:12.466 --> 18:13.467
But, um…

18:15.385 --> 18:16.970
you're gonna think I'm crazy.

18:17.638 --> 18:18.597
Try me.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.896
You know that thing
you were chasing last year?

18:27.272 --> 18:29.149
A "doorway to the beyond"?

18:30.484 --> 18:31.485
Yeah.

18:32.861 --> 18:35.114
It actually exists. [inhales]

18:36.031 --> 18:39.284
But it… it's not what you thought it was.

18:39.368 --> 18:42.287
It's not a place where our loved ones are.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.624
It's something dark and awful.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.002
This man, Gideon,

18:50.129 --> 18:52.756
he somehow opened a portal to that world.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.218
As in Frederick Gideon,
my ancestor who found the doorway?

18:56.301 --> 18:58.637
He's not exactly your ancestor anymore.

19:00.430 --> 19:02.599
He's trying to destroy everything.

19:02.683 --> 19:05.018
We've been trying to stop him… [exhales]

19:05.102 --> 19:08.522
…because we, the Lockes…

19:08.605 --> 19:09.481
[sniffles]

19:10.065 --> 19:14.236
…we've been tangled up in this for years.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.365
Okay.

19:18.448 --> 19:19.908
So this is

19:21.285 --> 19:24.288
where you decide I'm crazy.

19:25.914 --> 19:28.417
Well, last year,
I thought I'd lost it. [chuckles gently]

19:29.376 --> 19:32.588
I don't… I don't understand
a lot of what you're saying.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.342
But I believe you.

19:39.219 --> 19:40.387
[sighs]

19:43.473 --> 19:44.808
-[Josh groans]
-[Nina] Oh.

19:50.772 --> 19:52.482
Home sweet home.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.406
[ice crackling]

20:04.995 --> 20:05.829
Bode?

20:05.913 --> 20:08.832
I'm here! I knew you guys would come back.

20:08.916 --> 20:12.127
Go wait outside the Ghost Door.
We're gonna get you a new body.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.380
Him? No way. I've got a better idea.

20:17.257 --> 20:18.592
Quit dawdling.

20:19.092 --> 20:20.761
[adventurous music playing]

20:20.844 --> 20:22.846
[bird fluttering]

20:33.815 --> 20:35.776
-[Nina] They're releasing Josh.
-Oh, that's great.

20:35.859 --> 20:38.111
Rufus is walking Jamie
back to their apartment.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.447
She's gonna be so relieved
to hear that he's okay.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.658
And have you heard from Tyler or Kinsey?

20:43.784 --> 20:45.244
I don't think we should wait.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.536
Let's go.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.205
[foreboding music playing]

20:48.288 --> 20:50.290
[eerie rumbling]

20:53.794 --> 20:55.963
Tyler and Kinsey Locke.

20:57.464 --> 21:00.175
Pride of your forebears

21:00.259 --> 21:03.178
and thieves just like them.

21:03.679 --> 21:04.888
Thieves?

21:05.555 --> 21:07.015
This is our house.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.892
Those keys belong to us.

21:11.061 --> 21:14.648
Those keys that you speak of,
they are my kind.

21:15.399 --> 21:18.277
You do not own my kin.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.446
And one of my kin remains unaccounted for.

21:21.530 --> 21:22.823
Hmm?

21:24.074 --> 21:25.075
So,

21:26.410 --> 21:29.705
why don't you just spare your family?

21:36.461 --> 21:37.963
The key's in the graveyard.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.925
But you can only get it
by entering the Ghost Plane.

21:42.009 --> 21:43.927
You won't be able to find it otherwise.

21:46.179 --> 21:48.265
Why would you hide it there?

21:49.266 --> 21:51.143
Because it was the safest place for it.

21:51.768 --> 21:53.770
You can only access it with the Ghost Key.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.274
Through the door in the winter study.

22:03.572 --> 22:04.656
Bolton,

22:06.158 --> 22:07.617
he'll go and fetch it.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.624
[music swells, ends]

22:17.502 --> 22:18.837
We're going to Keyhouse.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.005
I want to help.

22:20.088 --> 22:21.131
[Ellie on phone] No, Rufus.

22:21.214 --> 22:23.967
You stay there with Jamie.
I'll call you when it's safe.

22:24.843 --> 22:25.802
I love you.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.436
Does your dad have a bike?

22:36.188 --> 22:38.398
[clicking and cranking]

22:38.482 --> 22:39.858
[birds chirping]

22:42.903 --> 22:44.946
What are his instructions?

22:45.447 --> 22:46.323
[Tyler] Ah.

22:48.241 --> 22:51.244
You fly out this way, past the well house.

22:51.328 --> 22:54.081
About a quarter of a mile away,
there's a graveyard.

22:54.164 --> 22:56.375
-The key's there.
-Where?

22:56.875 --> 22:59.294
[Tyler] In a coffin,
buried with one of our ancestors.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.253
[whooshing]

23:00.337 --> 23:02.547
[Tyler] It's in an unmarked grave
in the second row,

23:02.631 --> 23:04.424
next to Ben Locke's headstone.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.468
[Bolton] Can't we just dig it up?

23:06.551 --> 23:09.304
-[Tyler] No. No, uh…
-[tinkling, whooshing]

23:09.846 --> 23:11.139
We hid it when we were ghosts.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.392
So… So you can only see it
in the Ghost Plane.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.102
Bode?

23:16.269 --> 23:17.521
[twittering]

23:22.943 --> 23:25.404
Will I encounter other ghosts?

23:25.487 --> 23:27.280
Just get me my key!

23:27.364 --> 23:28.824
[whooshing, tinkling]

23:29.699 --> 23:31.410
And hurry up!

23:31.952 --> 23:33.954
[frantic music playing]

23:39.626 --> 23:41.837
You better hope that he finds it.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.547
[vehicle pulling up]

23:45.465 --> 23:46.591
Who's this?

23:49.886 --> 23:51.012
[vehicle door opens]

23:53.098 --> 23:54.015
[vehicle door closes]

23:55.058 --> 23:57.978
What is Bode waiting for?
Bolton's body is right there.

23:58.061 --> 24:00.397
Forget Bolton. Bode has a better plan.

24:01.398 --> 24:03.942
-We just need to get the Animal Key.
-What?

24:04.860 --> 24:05.902
Just trust me.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.196
[Tyler grunts]

24:14.411 --> 24:16.204
[dramatic music playing]

24:18.582 --> 24:19.583
You.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.712
You've been to my world.

24:24.921 --> 24:27.215
That's right. I escaped.

24:28.383 --> 24:29.468
Not for long.

24:30.969 --> 24:32.220
You sure about that?

26:12.779 --> 26:14.864
[breathing shakily]

26:15.448 --> 26:16.825
-[eerie pulsing]
-[gasps]

26:17.867 --> 26:18.702
[whimpering]

26:19.327 --> 26:20.453
[yelping]

26:20.537 --> 26:21.538
[panting in fear]

26:21.621 --> 26:24.124
-[dramatic music playing]
-[Ellie whimpering]

26:24.958 --> 26:25.959
[breathing heavily]

26:27.168 --> 26:29.170
[breathing heavily]

26:29.254 --> 26:30.964
[music continues]

26:33.300 --> 26:34.426
[panting]

26:36.219 --> 26:37.429
-[thuds]
-[Ellie screams]

26:37.512 --> 26:38.388
[Captain grunts]

26:38.471 --> 26:39.681
[Ellie] Rufus!

26:39.764 --> 26:40.724
[Captain roars]

26:46.313 --> 26:48.148
Tell me where the final key is.

26:48.648 --> 26:51.359
No last tricks. No more lies.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.278
Stop. Don't.

26:56.239 --> 26:57.532
I know where the key is.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.242
-What?
-You do?

27:00.744 --> 27:03.204
Let Rufus go, and it's yours.

27:08.543 --> 27:09.961
[whooshing]

27:10.045 --> 27:12.047
[suspenseful music playing]

27:17.677 --> 27:19.679
[music intensifies]

27:24.517 --> 27:25.560
[panting]

27:25.644 --> 27:27.354
They lied about the key, sir.

27:28.355 --> 27:30.857
You're worse than a broken clock.

27:30.940 --> 27:32.150
Just tie them up!

27:33.443 --> 27:36.154
The key is inside the head
of an old classmate.

27:37.113 --> 27:39.741
I put it there for safekeeping
back in high school.

27:40.909 --> 27:41.868
Who?

27:44.454 --> 27:45.580
Gordie Shaw.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.462
If you're lying, your son dies.

27:52.545 --> 27:54.005
I'm telling the truth.

27:59.636 --> 28:02.472
Yes. I believe you are.

28:04.307 --> 28:06.559
And you're going to take me to it.

28:11.439 --> 28:13.441
[key clicking and cranking]

28:13.525 --> 28:14.609
[magical whoosh]

28:19.114 --> 28:20.156
[keys clinking]

28:32.210 --> 28:33.294
[magical whoosh]

28:38.425 --> 28:39.634
Lock them in the pantry.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.929
If I'm not back in an hour with the key…

28:44.973 --> 28:46.057
kill them all.

28:49.185 --> 28:50.145
Mom.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.856
-[somber music playing]
-[Ellie exhales]

28:55.567 --> 28:56.651
Let's go.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.278
[music continues]

29:01.573 --> 29:03.074
[Ellie grunts, pants]

29:08.580 --> 29:11.583
Your mom's a badass.
She's going to be okay.

29:14.627 --> 29:17.547
Why would the Keepers hide a key
inside Gordie's head?

29:18.047 --> 29:21.718
I don't know,
but I think she was telling the truth.

29:23.386 --> 29:24.763
What do you think it does?

29:26.931 --> 29:28.057
[key clinking]

29:30.685 --> 29:31.519
[door unlocking]

29:31.603 --> 29:33.605
[dramatic music plays]

29:35.023 --> 29:35.940
It's okay. I'm…

29:37.150 --> 29:38.109
I'm not Bolton.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.280
It's me.

29:43.323 --> 29:44.199
Sam.

29:44.699 --> 29:46.701
[dramatic music playing]

29:50.246 --> 29:52.248
[music intensifies]

29:56.044 --> 29:57.170
[music ends]

29:59.088 --> 30:01.090
