<i>A long time ago,
Britain was ruled</i>

00:47.955 --> 00:50.692
<i>by King Uther Pendragon.</i>

00:52.092 --> 00:55.261
<i>But when Uther died
without an heir,</i>

00:55.528 --> 00:58.800
<i>the land was
torn apart by war.</i>

01:00.099 --> 01:02.535
<i>Many tried to claim the throne</i>

01:02.537 --> 01:05.572
<i>and fought bitterly
and endlessly.</i>

01:05.839 --> 01:09.376
<i>People's hearts
grew hopeless and hollow.</i>

01:09.610 --> 01:13.614
<i>The country became
lost and leaderless.</i>

01:14.280 --> 01:15.948
<i>So the wizard Merlin</i>

01:15.950 --> 01:21.388
<i>conjured a magical sword
in a stone called Excalibur</i>

01:21.589 --> 01:24.856
<i>and declared that only
Uther's true heir</i>

01:24.858 --> 01:26.358
<i>could pull it free.</i>

01:26.360 --> 01:27.962
<i>Many tried,</i>

01:28.361 --> 01:30.565
<i>but only one succeeded.</i>

01:30.997 --> 01:32.831
<i>A boy named Arthur,</i>

01:32.833 --> 01:37.137
<i>who had no idea he was
Uther's long-lost son.</i>

01:37.537 --> 01:40.706
<i>Arthur grew into a great king.</i>

01:40.708 --> 01:43.674
<i>He turned his enemies
into allies</i>

01:43.676 --> 01:47.613
<i>and ruled at a round table,
so that all were equal.</i>

01:47.848 --> 01:51.650
<i>He and his knights lived
by a code of chivalry,</i>

01:51.652 --> 01:54.151
<i>their hearts pure and noble.</i>

01:54.153 --> 01:55.853
<i>But their greatest foe</i>

01:55.855 --> 02:00.126
<i>was Arthur's own
half-sister, Morgana.</i>

02:00.393 --> 02:03.261
<i>Convinced she was
the rightful heir,</i>

02:03.263 --> 02:06.097
<i>and desperate
to possess Excalibur,</i>

02:06.099 --> 02:08.735
<i>she turned to dark sorcery.</i>

02:09.070 --> 02:12.473
<i>Arthur fought a fearsome
battle against her,</i>

02:12.673 --> 02:16.473
<i>and bound her into
the bowels of the earth.</i>

02:16.475 --> 02:20.912
<i>But not before
she swore dark vengeance.</i>

02:20.914 --> 02:23.914
When you are long gone,

02:23.916 --> 02:25.783
when hearts are hollow

02:25.785 --> 02:29.623
and the land is lost
and leaderless again,

02:30.757 --> 02:33.124
I will return.

02:33.126 --> 02:36.096
<i>And so will the sword.</i>

02:44.539 --> 02:46.437
<i>Alex, you're gonna be late.</i>

02:46.439 --> 02:47.874
Okay, okay!

02:49.309 --> 02:50.977
I'm coming as fast as I can.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.711
Your homework's
all over the kitchen table.

02:58.184 --> 03:00.152
You know, every time you
sleep in

03:00.154 --> 03:01.486
and skip breakfast,
it's like...

03:01.488 --> 03:03.822
...starting the day
on an empty battery.

03:03.824 --> 03:04.791
I know.

03:05.125 --> 03:06.290
Maybe if you hadn't
left that

03:06.292 --> 03:08.129
till last thing
the night before...

03:08.761 --> 03:09.663
Damn.

03:11.231 --> 03:12.399
Here.

03:14.368 --> 03:17.902
It's not exactly
the right color, but...

03:21.608 --> 03:23.945
Maybe you can say
it's a solar flare.

03:25.178 --> 03:26.146
Thanks, Mum.

03:26.346 --> 03:27.812
<i>You're listening to the BBC.</i>

03:27.814 --> 03:29.784
<i>It's 7:30am,
it's time for the news.</i>

03:38.892 --> 03:40.927
<i>BBC News at 7:30.</i>

03:41.195 --> 03:42.260
<i>Experts are warning that</i>

03:42.262 --> 03:43.729
<i>the world is becoming
more unstable</i>

03:43.731 --> 03:45.462
<i>than it has been
for centuries.</i>

03:45.464 --> 03:47.231
<i>With dictators and strongmen</i>

03:47.233 --> 03:48.400
<i>gaining power
in more countries</i>

03:48.402 --> 03:49.568
<i>than ever before,</i>

03:49.570 --> 03:50.968
<i>global divisions
are increasing</i>

03:50.970 --> 03:52.069
<i>at an alarming rate.</i>

03:58.112 --> 03:59.414
Oh, no.

04:03.316 --> 04:05.586
Excuse me.

04:07.087 --> 04:08.155
Sorry.

04:14.261 --> 04:15.496
'Scuse me.

04:24.872 --> 04:25.872
Bedders!

04:26.372 --> 04:27.941
Has anyone seen Bedders?

04:29.710 --> 04:31.345
Bedders! Where are you?

04:32.078 --> 04:34.846
Let go of me! Leave me alone!

04:34.848 --> 04:35.949
Put me down!

04:36.150 --> 04:37.885
No, no, and no.

04:38.619 --> 04:40.020
You wanna survive
in this school,

04:40.386 --> 04:41.653
you gotta pay
for the privilege.

04:41.655 --> 04:43.487
You're cutting off
my circulation.

04:43.489 --> 04:45.290
I am going to pass out.

04:45.292 --> 04:46.692
Keep your voice down

04:46.694 --> 04:48.595
or I'll punch my PIN number
into your legs.

04:48.795 --> 04:50.564
My head's filling up
with blood.

04:51.098 --> 04:52.363
It's going to explode!

04:52.365 --> 04:54.534
I feel weird.

04:55.001 --> 04:55.867
Help!

04:55.869 --> 04:58.939
- Somebody help me.
- Hey! Let him go.

05:02.109 --> 05:04.946
Oh, look.
It's the Lego Minifigure boy.

05:06.280 --> 05:07.748
I said, leave him alone.

05:09.883 --> 05:11.519
- Ooh.
- Why should we?

05:13.086 --> 05:14.387
Because there's two of you,

05:14.720 --> 05:17.456
he's half your size,
and he's my friend.

05:17.458 --> 05:19.093
- Aw.
- Mm.

05:26.734 --> 05:29.003
How many times
do I have to tell you?

05:30.271 --> 05:32.372
Don't be a hero.
It's not worth it.

05:32.638 --> 05:34.008
I'm the king around here.

05:36.542 --> 05:38.309
Careful not to drown
in that puddle.

05:38.311 --> 05:39.614
See you later, girls.

05:48.888 --> 05:50.389
Off me!
Get off me, shrimp!

05:50.391 --> 05:51.622
Break it up! Break it up!

05:51.624 --> 05:53.326
Move aside, move aside!

05:53.626 --> 05:55.362
Alexander Elliot!

05:55.963 --> 05:57.329
I'll give you
one last chance,

05:57.331 --> 06:00.064
or I'll just have to give
all three of you detention.

06:00.066 --> 06:01.302
Who started it?

06:03.270 --> 06:04.171
No one.

06:04.737 --> 06:06.004
Your behavior here

06:06.006 --> 06:08.743
directly affects
the rest of your life.

06:09.442 --> 06:10.877
You know that, don't you?

06:11.778 --> 06:13.579
It's a tough world out there

06:13.581 --> 06:16.116
and it's getting tougher
all the time.

06:16.617 --> 06:18.483
There's millions of kids
in this country

06:18.485 --> 06:20.487
with a better start in life
than you.

06:21.054 --> 06:24.158
And the world
is not going to change.

06:24.891 --> 06:27.661
It's you that has to change.

06:31.264 --> 06:33.497
Alex, you saved my life,

06:33.499 --> 06:36.266
and now I owe you
my undying loyalty.

06:36.268 --> 06:38.136
Like Frodo and Samwise

06:38.138 --> 06:39.603
or Chewbacca and Han

06:39.605 --> 06:41.173
or Donkey and Shrek.

06:41.708 --> 06:44.509
We'll make sure we're on
the same bus every morning.

06:44.511 --> 06:46.045
And I'll wait for you
at lunch break

06:46.047 --> 06:47.112
and after school,

06:47.114 --> 06:49.314
so if they ever dare
try anything...

06:49.316 --> 06:50.984
We already do that, Bedders.

06:51.518 --> 06:53.654
Lance and Kaye
rule the school.

06:54.254 --> 06:55.756
There's nothing you can do.

06:56.689 --> 06:58.358
There's nothing
either of us can do.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.362
This isn't
junior school anymore.

07:02.162 --> 07:03.663
We're nothings now.

07:04.631 --> 07:05.797
We're the most insignificant,

07:05.799 --> 07:07.735
powerless people
in the school.

07:11.538 --> 07:12.639
Hey.

07:13.340 --> 07:14.405
Hey!

07:14.407 --> 07:15.843
I learnt a new trick.

07:16.143 --> 07:17.311
Hold out your hand.

07:20.581 --> 07:23.083
Now squeeze
as hard as you can.

07:23.984 --> 07:25.182
Abracadabra!

07:25.184 --> 07:26.319
Alakazam!

07:26.720 --> 07:28.155
Open your hand.

07:31.158 --> 07:32.994
Wait, that's not right.

07:35.028 --> 07:37.261
You're supposed to have
both of them.

07:37.263 --> 07:39.030
It's a duplication illusion.

07:39.032 --> 07:41.135
It's really good
when it works.

07:43.537 --> 07:44.804
Don't worry about it, Bedders.

07:45.138 --> 07:47.174
I'm not in the mood
for magic anymore.

07:55.749 --> 07:57.650
<i>Alex, are you okay?</i>

07:57.850 --> 07:59.285
It's not true, is it?

07:59.852 --> 08:01.351
What would make you
jump on someone

08:01.353 --> 08:03.089
and start punching them?

08:03.557 --> 08:04.458
Alex.

08:05.057 --> 08:06.759
They were bullying Bedders.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.428
I tried to stop them.

08:08.929 --> 08:11.032
No one said
anything about that.

08:11.865 --> 08:15.001
Why didn't you say something?
Why didn't you tell someone?

08:17.437 --> 08:20.273
Alex, look at you.

08:21.275 --> 08:23.240
Because it would just
make everything worse.

08:23.242 --> 08:26.146
How could telling the truth
make everything worse?

08:26.379 --> 08:28.015
You wouldn't understand.

08:31.417 --> 08:33.054
Dad would understand.

08:34.121 --> 08:35.020
Well...

08:36.256 --> 08:37.289
he's not here.

08:39.226 --> 08:42.929
But if he was,
I know exactly what he'd say.

08:43.764 --> 08:44.898
He'd say that
telling the truth

08:45.131 --> 08:48.468
and doing the right thing
never makes anything worse.

08:49.636 --> 08:52.039
You always used to
believe that, Alex.

08:53.006 --> 08:53.908
Yeah.

08:55.141 --> 08:56.276
Well, not anymore.

09:03.117 --> 09:06.284
- <i>I can taste it...</i>
- <i>Taste.</i>

09:06.286 --> 09:08.155
<i>...in the rain.</i>

09:09.088 --> 09:12.992
- <i>Sense it in the soil.</i>
- <i>Sense it.</i>

09:13.693 --> 09:15.829
<i>What they once had...</i>

09:16.764 --> 09:18.897
<i>is long lost.</i>

09:18.899 --> 09:21.131
<i>Long lost.</i>

09:21.133 --> 09:23.902
- <i>They are divided.</i>
- <i>Divided.</i>

09:23.904 --> 09:26.404
- <i>Fearful.</i>
- <i>Fearful.</i>

09:26.406 --> 09:28.907
- <i>Leaderless.</i>
- <i>Leaderless.</i>

09:28.909 --> 09:30.908
<i>Leaderless. Leaderless...</i>

09:30.910 --> 09:33.077
<i>As they grow weaker...</i>

09:33.079 --> 09:34.678
<i>Weaker... Weaker...</i>

09:34.680 --> 09:37.414
<i>...I grow stronger.</i>

09:37.416 --> 09:39.283
<i>Stronger.</i>

09:39.285 --> 09:43.022
<i>Soon, darkness will dawn.</i>

09:44.992 --> 09:48.295
<i>My time will come.</i>

09:53.000 --> 09:55.302
Come on, no doodling.

09:55.868 --> 09:58.439
This is detention,
not art class.

10:00.372 --> 10:01.975
Concentrate.

10:11.818 --> 10:13.817
Oi! Alex Elliot!

10:13.819 --> 10:15.820
Wait for us.
We wanna talk to you.

10:15.822 --> 10:17.389
Where are you going?
Don't run away.

10:17.391 --> 10:19.657
What's the matter?
What are you frightened of?

10:23.764 --> 10:25.432
Go, go! Run, get him!

10:25.899 --> 10:28.434
That fast as you can go?

10:29.435 --> 10:30.902
We're right behind you!

10:30.904 --> 10:32.573
You're dead now,
you little snitch!

10:34.440 --> 10:35.740
Alex Elliot!

10:35.742 --> 10:38.509
Oi! Come here!
Here, boy!

10:58.766 --> 11:00.467
Hey, Lance! I've got him.

11:00.833 --> 11:03.436
Oi. What you running for?

11:03.936 --> 11:06.005
You and me have got
a fight to finish.

11:19.986 --> 11:21.422
We'd better leave.

12:09.902 --> 12:12.473
Hello? Is anybody here?

12:50.343 --> 12:53.413
Bedders, tell your dad
we've got homework together.

12:53.880 --> 12:57.384
Come across the garden walls.
You've gotta see what I found.

13:02.856 --> 13:05.155
<i>The sword has returned.</i>

13:05.157 --> 13:07.991
<i>Has returned.
Returned. The sword.</i>

13:07.993 --> 13:10.861
<i>The sword has been drawn.</i>

13:12.332 --> 13:15.600
Let the roots be my senses.

13:15.602 --> 13:16.868
<i>Senses.</i>

13:16.870 --> 13:20.871
Let the land
be my eyes and ears.

13:20.873 --> 13:22.273
<i>Eyes and ears.</i>

13:22.275 --> 13:25.245
Find the one who drew it.

13:25.978 --> 13:29.413
Find the new king.

13:29.415 --> 13:31.749
<i>Find the new king.</i>

13:31.751 --> 13:35.320
The sword must be mine.

13:35.722 --> 13:38.923
The king must die.

13:38.925 --> 13:42.894
<i>The king.
The new king. Find the new king.</i>

13:42.896 --> 13:45.397
<i>Find the new king.</i>

13:54.875 --> 13:56.307
Maybe it's a prank.

13:56.309 --> 13:59.480
A YouTube thing.
A social experiment.

14:00.347 --> 14:02.182
Maybe there were
hidden cameras.

14:03.449 --> 14:04.550
Look.

14:06.151 --> 14:07.820
There's something written
on the guard.

14:08.288 --> 14:10.124
Put it into Google Translate.

14:11.592 --> 14:12.492
<i>"Gladius...</i>

14:13.626 --> 14:14.761
<i>Arturi...</i>

14:17.530 --> 14:19.697
<i>filius Tintageli."</i>

14:21.501 --> 14:22.468
It's Latin.

14:22.736 --> 14:28.375
It means, "Sword of Arthur,
son of Tinta-gel."

14:29.575 --> 14:30.743
Who's Tinta-gel?

14:33.981 --> 14:35.246
What are you doing?

14:35.248 --> 14:38.117
My dad gave me
a book once, years ago...

14:39.118 --> 14:40.884
about the Knights
of the Round Table.

14:40.886 --> 14:42.655
I used to know it
off by heart.

14:52.931 --> 14:54.800
It's not "Tinta-gel,"
it's Tintagel.

14:55.135 --> 14:58.304
And Tintagel's not a person,
it's a place...

14:58.938 --> 15:00.874
an island off the coast
of Cornwall.

15:01.274 --> 15:03.208
There's an old
ruined castle there.

15:03.609 --> 15:06.011
Some people say it's where
King Arthur was born.

15:06.346 --> 15:09.583
I went there once
when I was five.

15:10.583 --> 15:12.018
It's where my dad lived.

15:12.486 --> 15:14.254
The last time I ever saw him.

15:14.788 --> 15:17.224
That's where I was
when he gave me this book.

15:18.290 --> 15:19.825
He even signed it.

15:20.025 --> 15:21.093
Look.

15:21.795 --> 15:26.333
"To Alex, my once
and future king. Dad."

15:27.867 --> 15:30.670
Alex, what if
this is a message?

15:31.137 --> 15:32.303
What if you're the only person

15:32.305 --> 15:34.406
who could have pulled
that sword out?

15:34.641 --> 15:35.541
What if it's...

15:36.242 --> 15:38.342
- Go on.
- But you'll laugh at me.

15:38.344 --> 15:39.779
I won't, I promise.

15:40.380 --> 15:43.583
What if it's
the Sword in the Stone?

15:53.258 --> 15:55.495
Behold, Excalibur.

15:56.228 --> 15:57.895
Kneel before your king.

15:57.897 --> 15:59.432
Yes, my lord.

16:01.800 --> 16:06.272
You're my closest and oldest
and very best friend.

16:06.939 --> 16:08.242
I knight thee...

16:12.045 --> 16:13.579
Sir Beddersvere.

16:14.580 --> 16:16.480
<i>Alex, is your light still on?</i>

16:16.482 --> 16:18.819
- <i>You better be in bed.</i>
- Quick, go.

16:21.453 --> 16:23.254
- Alex.
- What?

16:23.256 --> 16:24.655
You don't really think

16:24.657 --> 16:27.393
that's the real
Sword in the Stone, do you?

16:28.996 --> 16:30.364
Of course not.

17:09.970 --> 17:11.438
Morning.

17:12.003 --> 17:13.239
Bloody hell.

17:13.772 --> 17:15.204
Oh. Forgive me.

17:15.207 --> 17:17.075
I completely forgot
to include clothing

17:17.077 --> 17:19.310
in my Vivifica
Transubtantiatio.

17:19.546 --> 17:22.512
Do you by any chance
have any beetle blood,

17:22.513 --> 17:24.914
ground animal bone,
or beaver urine?

17:24.915 --> 17:25.883
What?

17:25.885 --> 17:27.319
Very well.

17:27.685 --> 17:30.590
In that case,
I require your smock.

17:41.434 --> 17:42.601
<i>Surely, Officers,</i>

17:42.868 --> 17:45.539
it's not against the law to
take a morning constitutional.

17:46.005 --> 17:47.771
Or to wear
loose-fitting garments

17:47.773 --> 17:48.641
that permit fresh air

17:48.841 --> 17:51.043
to circulate around
one's crevices and furrows.

17:51.511 --> 17:55.415
Now, your carriage
seems warm and dry.

17:55.682 --> 17:59.050
Take me east at once,
posthaste.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.374
<i>Romeo Charlie zero one,</i>

18:23.376 --> 18:24.474
<i>what is your location?</i>

18:24.476 --> 18:26.012
What just happened?

18:32.819 --> 18:34.685
<i>Pay attention,
everybody.</i>

18:34.687 --> 18:37.688
We have a new pupil
joining the class today.

18:37.690 --> 18:39.760
Why don't you
introduce yourself?

18:40.827 --> 18:44.498
Greetings, young academicians.
My name is...

18:45.063 --> 18:46.065
Mertin.

18:46.433 --> 18:47.632
Yes, that's right.

18:47.634 --> 18:50.237
Mertin Ambrosius Caledonensis.

18:50.502 --> 18:52.303
And I am a perfectly normal

18:52.305 --> 18:54.441
contemporary
British schoolboy.

18:57.609 --> 18:59.676
Quiet down, please.

18:59.678 --> 19:02.211
No, Bedders. Absolutely not.

19:02.213 --> 19:03.950
We cannot talk to that boy.

19:04.151 --> 19:05.583
But he looks cool.

19:05.585 --> 19:08.051
At the very least
I bet he's into magic,

19:08.053 --> 19:10.821
and role-playing games,
and <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

19:10.823 --> 19:13.324
Listen to me.
For the first time ever,

19:13.326 --> 19:16.560
there's someone in this school
who's more bullyable than us.

19:16.562 --> 19:18.162
We have to stay away from him.

19:18.164 --> 19:20.701
As far away as possible.

19:21.401 --> 19:22.833
Some metals are common,

19:22.835 --> 19:25.105
like copper,
and are called base metals.

19:25.605 --> 19:28.605
Others are rare and valuable,
like gold,

19:28.607 --> 19:30.474
and are called
precious metals.

19:30.476 --> 19:33.277
Now, a long time ago,
people called "alchemists"

19:33.279 --> 19:35.011
believed that you could
change base metals

19:35.013 --> 19:36.446
to precious metals.

19:36.448 --> 19:39.316
These sections of
the Earth's crust

19:39.318 --> 19:41.484
contain a wealth of history.

19:41.486 --> 19:43.554
Ruins, dead bodies,

19:43.556 --> 19:45.823
evidence of past
civilizations.

19:45.825 --> 19:50.394
And slowly move your
moons across, between the two.

19:50.396 --> 19:52.762
You will start to see
how these two planets,

19:52.764 --> 19:54.632
when their orbits intersect,

19:54.634 --> 19:58.403
will cause the upcoming
total solar eclipse.

19:58.405 --> 19:59.838
"Upcoming"?

20:00.272 --> 20:01.573
What do you mean, "upcoming"?

20:01.840 --> 20:04.843
When exactly is this
total solar eclipse due?

20:04.845 --> 20:06.846
- Four days' time.
- Four days?

20:07.346 --> 20:10.316
God's socks.
This is a catastrophe.

20:10.582 --> 20:13.652
A disaster.
I thought it was four years.

20:14.521 --> 20:17.186
Get out of my way!
I need air, space to think!

20:22.861 --> 20:24.195
Alexander Elliot!

20:24.597 --> 20:26.532
It was you who drew the sword.

20:26.866 --> 20:29.599
In four moons there will be
darkness in daylight,

20:29.601 --> 20:32.102
the dual realms
will be bridged,

20:32.104 --> 20:34.607
and Morgana will return.

20:34.839 --> 20:35.841
Oh, no.

20:36.943 --> 20:40.111
You must saddle your steeds,
gird up your armor,

20:40.113 --> 20:41.548
gather your allies!

20:41.780 --> 20:42.948
Go away.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.482
We don't know you,
and we don't want to know you.

20:45.484 --> 20:46.619
Leave us alone!

20:50.022 --> 20:51.189
Good people,

20:51.557 --> 20:54.291
this realm faces
mortal danger!

20:54.293 --> 20:57.562
And this boy among you
drew Excalibur.

20:57.963 --> 21:01.902
Who will kneel at his feet
and swear allegiance?

21:06.271 --> 21:09.108
Stop it! Stop that!

21:15.714 --> 21:18.016
But Rokas saw it
with his own eyes.

21:18.518 --> 21:20.884
Danielle said they tried
to catch it for two hours,

21:20.886 --> 21:21.818
but it escaped.

21:21.820 --> 21:24.023
He did not turn into
an owl, Bedders.

21:24.290 --> 21:26.289
But he said we're
in mortal danger.

21:26.291 --> 21:27.525
And he knew about the sword.

21:27.527 --> 21:29.026
How could he know
about the sword?

21:29.028 --> 21:31.764
I don't know.
It's a coincidence.

21:32.030 --> 21:35.034
It doesn't matter,
I've made up my mind.

21:35.568 --> 21:36.767
I'm putting it back.

21:36.769 --> 21:38.604
Tomorrow night, after school.

21:38.971 --> 21:41.508
It's stolen property,
and it's a weapon.

21:42.008 --> 21:45.278
And it's making everything
go... weird.

21:45.744 --> 21:47.813
- But what if...
- But what if what?

21:49.348 --> 21:50.582
Nothing.

21:51.017 --> 21:52.251
Good night, Bedders.

23:26.945 --> 23:27.981
Mum!

23:28.947 --> 23:29.848
Mum?

23:30.617 --> 23:32.319
Mum.

23:33.685 --> 23:36.856
The sword must be mine.

23:49.168 --> 23:51.036
The king must die.

24:11.624 --> 24:13.760
Mertin?

24:16.428 --> 24:17.795
What are you doing here?

24:17.797 --> 24:21.201
Saving your life, boy.
From that thing.

24:21.568 --> 24:22.835
Don't you realize,

24:23.135 --> 24:25.803
appearing in the mortal realm
after sundown

24:25.805 --> 24:27.674
is lethal for me?

24:29.709 --> 24:33.146
Find me here tomorrow.

24:34.146 --> 24:35.781
Without fail.

24:37.215 --> 24:39.351
Open the window. Hurry.

25:17.223 --> 25:20.156
<i>He was a child, my Lady.</i>

25:20.158 --> 25:22.893
<i>A child, a child.</i>

25:22.895 --> 25:24.363
<i>A boy.</i>

25:24.629 --> 25:27.434
<i>No more than 12 winters.</i>

25:29.601 --> 25:31.102
<i>There was another.</i>

25:31.736 --> 25:34.907
<i>Hardly older than
the chosen king.</i>

25:35.508 --> 25:37.540
<i>He destroyed our sentinel</i>

25:37.542 --> 25:40.280
<i>with an elemental
manipulation.</i>

25:41.246 --> 25:42.848
Merlin.

25:43.382 --> 25:45.385
A child too.

25:46.851 --> 25:49.655
Have I waited so long?

25:49.856 --> 25:51.320
<i>So long.</i>

25:51.322 --> 25:54.826
Have I grown so old...

25:55.426 --> 25:59.866
that he has grown so young?

26:09.942 --> 26:12.875
Awake, my warriors,
cease your slumber.

26:12.877 --> 26:14.744
Nightfall will be ours.

26:14.746 --> 26:16.913
Awake, my warriors,
cease your slumber.

26:16.915 --> 26:18.080
Nightfall will be ours.

26:18.082 --> 26:20.450
Awake, my warriors,
cease your slumber.

26:20.452 --> 26:21.884
Nightfall will be ours.

26:21.886 --> 26:24.020
Awake, my warriors,
cease your slumber.

26:24.022 --> 26:25.689
Nightfall will be ours.

26:25.691 --> 26:27.657
<i>Nightfall will be ours.</i>

26:27.659 --> 26:29.526
<i>Nightfall will be ours.</i>

26:29.528 --> 26:32.265
<i>Nightfall will be ours.</i>

26:36.269 --> 26:40.306
Come on, Alex. It's time to
join the land of the living.

26:44.409 --> 26:45.777
<i>That is not Excalibur.</i>

26:46.444 --> 26:48.878
Tell me the truth.
Where did you get that thing?

26:48.880 --> 26:51.147
I told you,
on a building site.

26:51.149 --> 26:52.782
Then we're taking it
back there. Right now.

26:52.784 --> 26:54.651
No. You can't take it away.

26:54.653 --> 26:55.788
And you can't keep it.

26:56.121 --> 26:58.689
Alex, it's a dangerous weapon,
and it doesn't belong to you.

26:58.691 --> 27:00.126
Yes, it does.

27:01.927 --> 27:03.326
I pulled it out of a stone

27:03.328 --> 27:05.295
and something came
and tried to take it back.

27:05.297 --> 27:08.097
Something old and evil
that came out of the ground.

27:08.099 --> 27:10.902
And a boy from school came
and he saved me.

27:10.904 --> 27:12.470
And then he turned
into an owl.

27:12.472 --> 27:15.474
And I was wide awake
the whole time, I promise.

27:18.174 --> 27:19.244
Did you get that
out of the attic?

27:20.346 --> 27:23.749
Alex, I know you're
having a tough time.

27:24.116 --> 27:26.152
And I know you miss your dad.

27:26.786 --> 27:28.420
But he gave you that book

27:29.154 --> 27:32.124
because he wanted you to
grow up to be a good person.

27:32.957 --> 27:35.126
Not the kind of person
who gets into fights,

27:35.327 --> 27:37.928
not the kind of person
who believes in fairy tales,

27:37.930 --> 27:40.266
and not the kind of person
who carries...

27:40.665 --> 27:44.099
giant, medieval
weapons around.

27:44.101 --> 27:45.971
Then why did he write this?

27:51.042 --> 27:52.477
Because he loved you.

27:52.711 --> 27:54.314
Then why did he leave?

27:58.483 --> 28:01.753
Maybe I haven't told you
as much as I should about him.

28:02.387 --> 28:06.125
He had his battles.
His demons.

28:08.626 --> 28:10.029
But he loved you.

28:10.829 --> 28:12.530
And this has to stop.

28:13.165 --> 28:15.298
Now, we're taking that sword
to the police station

28:15.300 --> 28:17.203
and then I'm taking
you to school.

28:17.435 --> 28:18.736
Alex!

28:18.738 --> 28:20.403
Put that down. Now.

28:20.405 --> 28:21.438
No. It's mine.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.807
- I need it.
- I'm not telling you again.

28:23.809 --> 28:25.709
I have to go,
and I'm taking it with me.

28:25.711 --> 28:28.778
Alexander Elliot, don't you
dare leave this house.

28:31.149 --> 28:32.351
Alex.

28:32.717 --> 28:33.919
Sorry, Mum.

28:40.626 --> 28:41.961
Alex!

28:43.229 --> 28:44.463
Alex!

28:46.831 --> 28:48.199
<i>I feel sick, Alex.</i>

28:48.466 --> 28:51.067
I've never been outside school
on a weekday

28:51.069 --> 28:52.171
in term time before.

28:52.704 --> 28:55.473
Not without adult supervision
and a hi-vis vest.

28:55.773 --> 28:58.977
It's just, I'm used to reading
about this kind of thing.

28:59.278 --> 29:01.547
I'm not used to it
actually happening.

29:02.048 --> 29:03.582
Just calm down, Bedders.

29:03.882 --> 29:05.351
Let me do the talking.

29:09.754 --> 29:10.656
Ah!

29:11.523 --> 29:12.625
Finally.

29:14.559 --> 29:16.194
Take these, follow me.

29:17.963 --> 29:20.433
Come! I've taken temporary
lodging above.

29:23.234 --> 29:25.268
As I tried to explain
last night,

29:25.270 --> 29:27.203
appearing in the mortal realm
after dark

29:27.205 --> 29:29.908
drains my life force
extremely fast,

29:30.542 --> 29:33.242
let alone contending
with a Mortes Milles.

29:33.244 --> 29:36.280
It takes a very particular
potion to restore my strength.

29:36.982 --> 29:39.583
Beetle blood, ground bone
and beaver urine.

29:39.585 --> 29:42.184
I thought I'd have trouble
finding the ingredients,

29:42.186 --> 29:44.954
but Lip Smackin' Chicken
had it all.

29:44.956 --> 29:45.925
Really?

29:46.291 --> 29:48.727
The red in this cherryade
derives from beetle blood.

29:50.229 --> 29:53.098
The vanilla in this ice cream,
from beaver urine.

29:54.332 --> 29:55.865
And these nuggets
are largely gristle

29:55.867 --> 29:57.134
and ground animal bone.

29:57.136 --> 29:59.171
Altogether... mm...

29:59.570 --> 30:01.273
utterly invigorating.

30:02.107 --> 30:05.508
Mm.

30:06.678 --> 30:08.513
Your name isn't Mertin, is it?

30:10.014 --> 30:11.114
It's Merlin.

30:11.116 --> 30:13.048
An ingenious alias,
don't you think?

30:13.050 --> 30:15.184
Came up with it
on the spur of the moment

30:15.186 --> 30:17.322
in order to monitor you
incognito.

30:18.557 --> 30:20.559
I thought Merlin
was supposed to be an old man.

30:20.792 --> 30:22.025
You look about 16.

30:22.027 --> 30:24.394
That's because I live
backwards in time.

30:24.396 --> 30:27.029
The older I grow,
the younger I become.

30:27.031 --> 30:27.933
Honestly, boy,

30:28.367 --> 30:30.136
do they teach you nothing
in that so-called school?

30:31.002 --> 30:32.203
From now on,

30:32.570 --> 30:35.739
nighttime will be dangerous
for you too, Alexander.

30:35.741 --> 30:39.145
At night the penumbra between
light and dark weakens.

30:39.444 --> 30:41.914
The Mortes Milles
will rise again.

30:42.348 --> 30:46.182
Mortes Milles? Is that what
came to get me last night?

30:46.184 --> 30:48.786
Fallen warriors
from battles of old.

30:48.788 --> 30:51.121
Their souls enslaved by evil.

30:51.123 --> 30:54.594
For now, they can only
enter this realm after dark.

30:55.560 --> 30:56.662
But...

30:57.896 --> 31:02.635
when they rise, time freezes

31:03.135 --> 31:05.335
and every mortal
soul disappears,

31:05.337 --> 31:07.938
save for the one
who drew the sword

31:07.940 --> 31:09.775
and those who have
been knighted.

31:10.075 --> 31:12.644
Their spell is only
broken at sunrise.

31:12.877 --> 31:15.181
Or when every risen warrior...

31:16.682 --> 31:17.883
is destroyed.

31:18.416 --> 31:20.319
That's why my mum disappeared.

31:21.386 --> 31:24.253
That's why everything went
back to normal after you left.

31:24.255 --> 31:26.891
There are three moons
until the solar eclipse

31:26.893 --> 31:29.058
when Morgana will seize
her opportunity

31:29.060 --> 31:30.827
to enter the realm
of the living

31:30.829 --> 31:34.367
and retake
what she lost long ago.

31:34.733 --> 31:36.066
Excalibur.

31:36.068 --> 31:37.403
Who's Morgana?

31:38.303 --> 31:40.403
She was King Arthur's
half-sister.

31:40.405 --> 31:43.608
She is greed, entitlement,

31:43.943 --> 31:45.444
vengefulness.

31:46.011 --> 31:47.978
And she has awoken.

31:47.980 --> 31:50.247
But why? After all this time.

31:50.249 --> 31:52.785
Have you seen the world
outside your window?

31:53.118 --> 31:56.452
This land is divided.
Lost and leaderless.

31:56.454 --> 31:58.221
Men's hearts have
grown hollow.

31:58.223 --> 32:00.091
That's why
her strength returns.

32:00.459 --> 32:03.026
And that is why
the sword has returned.

32:03.028 --> 32:04.695
And I'm supposed to stop her?

32:05.129 --> 32:07.198
That's ridiculous. I'm 12.

32:07.566 --> 32:09.900
I'm not even old enough
to do a paper round.

32:09.902 --> 32:11.401
You'll have to find
someone else.

32:11.403 --> 32:13.606
It's too dangerous, we'll die.

32:15.007 --> 32:17.874
So, there's your sword back.

32:17.876 --> 32:21.213
It's been great to meet you,
and good luck with everything.

32:29.154 --> 32:31.523
Your quest has been decided.

32:31.924 --> 32:34.193
There is no turning back.

32:53.311 --> 32:56.913
You must find the
entrance to the Underworld.

32:56.915 --> 32:59.583
Defeat Morgana
in her own realm

32:59.585 --> 33:02.219
before the moon masks the sun,

33:02.221 --> 33:05.623
or you, your people,

33:05.625 --> 33:07.590
and the land
on which you live,

33:07.592 --> 33:08.827
are doomed.

33:15.300 --> 33:17.032
You have been chosen

33:17.034 --> 33:20.438
to save your kingdom
from slavery!

33:28.280 --> 33:31.181
Christmas Day,
that was exhausting.

33:32.584 --> 33:35.250
If I have to transform
into my adult self

33:35.252 --> 33:37.487
every time I need to
drive a point home,

33:37.489 --> 33:39.722
I'll be dead
before the day is done.

33:45.431 --> 33:46.296
Oh!

33:46.298 --> 33:48.565
Are there no unglazed windows

33:48.567 --> 33:52.402
or unblocked chimneys left
in this godforsaken country?

33:52.404 --> 33:53.938
Mertin... Merlin, wait.

33:53.940 --> 33:56.271
How do we find the entrance
to the Underworld?

33:56.273 --> 33:59.175
- Where do we go?
- You're a king, boy.

33:59.177 --> 34:02.211
The path you choose
must be your own.

34:05.451 --> 34:07.416
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

34:07.418 --> 34:09.351
This is the worst and best

34:09.353 --> 34:12.388
and most terrible
and brilliant and frightening

34:12.389 --> 34:14.658
and excellent thing
that's ever happened to me.

34:14.659 --> 34:16.694
We need to go somewhere
no one can find us.

34:17.062 --> 34:18.197
Somewhere we can think.

34:18.563 --> 34:21.766
Come on, Bedders.
It's this way.

34:31.743 --> 34:32.777
Look.

34:36.014 --> 34:37.379
The inscription.

34:37.380 --> 34:38.949
It's just like in the book.

34:39.217 --> 34:40.886
It's all just like
in the book.

34:41.386 --> 34:42.621
You were right.

34:45.922 --> 34:46.891
He knew.

34:47.359 --> 34:50.261
It's exactly the same
in every story we ever read.

34:50.763 --> 34:54.766
King Arthur, Luke Skywalker,
Harry Potter.

34:55.300 --> 34:56.799
None of them
know their fathers,

34:56.801 --> 34:58.734
and then something
amazing happens.

34:58.736 --> 35:01.138
And they find out they're
descended from powerful,

35:01.140 --> 35:02.641
magical families.

35:02.975 --> 35:05.444
That's me, Bedders. That's me!

35:06.412 --> 35:09.649
My mum said he had his battles
and his demons.

35:10.414 --> 35:11.816
And now I know what she meant.

35:12.417 --> 35:15.655
My dad's a hero.
He's the key to all of this.

35:17.589 --> 35:20.191
We have to go to Cornwall.
To Tintagel.

35:20.425 --> 35:21.658
We have to find him.

35:21.660 --> 35:24.096
But Cornwall's
hundreds of miles away.

35:24.662 --> 35:26.497
And you haven't seen him
for years.

35:26.499 --> 35:29.066
He'll know where the entrance
to the Underworld is.

35:29.068 --> 35:30.935
He'll know
how to defeat Morgana.

35:31.336 --> 35:33.071
He's the only one
who can help us.

35:34.272 --> 35:35.508
Look, Alex.

35:36.307 --> 35:37.742
It's already dark.

35:38.611 --> 35:41.410
Merlin said nighttime
would be dangerous.

35:41.412 --> 35:44.449
He said the penumbra between
light and dark weakens.

35:45.184 --> 35:46.250
He said...

35:46.252 --> 35:48.321
The Mortes Milles
will rise again.

35:50.222 --> 35:51.323
Hello, boys.

35:51.856 --> 35:53.958
Nice sword. Looks real.

35:54.225 --> 35:55.894
Yeah. Real valuable.

35:56.495 --> 35:57.828
Playing little games, are we?

35:57.830 --> 35:59.765
Having fun
with our imaginations?

36:00.064 --> 36:01.900
We like games. Can we join in?

36:02.301 --> 36:05.438
Give us a quick go with that.
We'll give it back, I promise.

36:06.906 --> 36:09.008
Sure. Help yourself.

36:12.077 --> 36:15.211
All you have to do
is pull it out of that stone.

36:15.213 --> 36:16.214
Easy.

36:16.515 --> 36:18.017
Excuse me, ladies.

36:21.019 --> 36:22.419
Come on.

36:22.821 --> 36:25.055
Stay here. Find something
to defend yourself with.

36:25.057 --> 36:27.457
Why? What are you gonna do?

36:27.459 --> 36:30.058
What Merlin said.
Gather some allies.

36:30.060 --> 36:31.497
Let me try again.

36:32.030 --> 36:33.365
Okay, ready.

36:33.564 --> 36:36.367
One, two, three.

36:36.635 --> 36:39.201
I'm the only one who can
pull the sword from the stone.

36:39.203 --> 36:40.803
I'm the once and future king.

36:40.805 --> 36:42.705
I'll pull it out
and you can hold it

36:42.707 --> 36:44.707
if you both kneel
and let me knight you.

36:44.709 --> 36:46.642
Oh, my God,
you're such a nerd.

36:46.644 --> 36:48.879
You're a king, are you?
Really?

36:49.147 --> 36:50.479
Well, you're not royal.

36:50.481 --> 36:52.147
So what kind of a king
are you?

36:52.149 --> 36:53.383
Maybe he's a Burger King.

36:53.385 --> 36:55.084
He's too small
to be King Kong.

36:55.086 --> 36:56.320
He could be the Lion King.

36:56.722 --> 36:59.091
Come on, then, Simba.
Let's see you pull it out.

36:59.658 --> 37:04.063
You swear, if I do,
you'll let me knight you both?

37:04.296 --> 37:05.498
We swear.

37:08.200 --> 37:09.167
Excuse me.

37:13.504 --> 37:15.372
Now, kneel.

37:15.374 --> 37:17.774
No way. I don't kneel.
Not for anybody.

37:17.776 --> 37:19.712
Do it. Then we get to play.

37:22.747 --> 37:25.147
I knight thee,
Lady Kaye.

37:27.218 --> 37:28.986
Come on, then. Get on with it.

37:29.555 --> 37:31.723
I knight thee,
Sir Lance.

37:34.926 --> 37:38.328
What are you gonna
do now, Percy Jockstrap?

37:38.330 --> 37:40.598
Cast a spell? Summon a dragon?

37:42.200 --> 37:43.435
Sort of.

37:58.950 --> 38:01.986
Nightfall will be ours.

38:03.388 --> 38:05.057
Move! Hide!

38:08.993 --> 38:10.028
Lance! Run!

38:23.508 --> 38:25.844
Lance! Get up! Move!

38:32.283 --> 38:33.752
There's another one.

38:40.225 --> 38:41.227
Come on, Lance!

38:42.493 --> 38:43.459
Run!

38:43.461 --> 38:44.528
Faster! Go, go!

38:44.530 --> 38:46.265
- Move!
- Hurry!

38:50.769 --> 38:52.604
Tell me I'm dreaming this!

38:56.039 --> 38:57.006
Help me!

39:03.548 --> 39:04.747
They're still coming!

39:04.749 --> 39:05.881
- Go!
- Run!

39:05.883 --> 39:07.885
Faster!
Out of the way!

39:08.553 --> 39:11.757
- Run! Hurry!
- Wait! Wait!

39:18.595 --> 39:20.830
Help!
They're right behind me!

39:20.832 --> 39:22.299
Come on, Bedders!

39:22.301 --> 39:23.435
Help!

39:23.801 --> 39:25.000
- Run!
- Bedders!

39:25.002 --> 39:26.836
- Don't leave me behind!
- Quickly!

39:26.838 --> 39:28.640
- Help!
- Help!

39:29.106 --> 39:30.439
Somebody help us!

39:30.441 --> 39:31.941
Help!

39:31.943 --> 39:34.979
There's no one here!
Everyone's vanished!

39:36.548 --> 39:37.649
What the flip's happened?

39:37.883 --> 39:40.383
Where's everyone gone?
Why are all these cars empty?

39:40.385 --> 39:43.486
It's just like Merlin
said! Everyone's disappeared!

39:47.892 --> 39:49.491
Alex, what are you doing?

39:49.493 --> 39:52.664
Alex! Run! Alex!

39:54.231 --> 39:57.168
They're just made of bones!
We can kill them!

39:59.905 --> 40:02.738
- There's two more!
- We can't outrun them.

40:02.740 --> 40:04.207
What are we gonna do?

40:04.209 --> 40:05.944
Hey, can anybody drive?

40:09.046 --> 40:10.613
- Hurry up, Bedders!
- Come on!

40:10.615 --> 40:11.716
Get in!

40:12.517 --> 40:14.086
Get off me!

40:24.763 --> 40:25.898
We lost one!

40:26.365 --> 40:29.301
It's catching up!
On the left! On the left!

40:35.140 --> 40:36.308
Wait for it.

40:39.077 --> 40:40.243
Whoa!

40:40.245 --> 40:42.181
Oh!

40:44.448 --> 40:45.682
Get the last one,

40:45.684 --> 40:47.785
and everything
will go back to normal!

40:49.555 --> 40:50.886
Hold on!

40:55.060 --> 40:56.895
Where did you learn
how to drive?

40:57.294 --> 40:58.664
Mario Kart.

41:10.642 --> 41:11.777
What?

41:15.680 --> 41:17.716
- The traffic!
- Stop! Stop!

41:39.437 --> 41:41.372
Kaye, thanks.

41:42.240 --> 41:43.240
You saved us.

41:43.242 --> 41:45.310
I was gonna say
the same thing to you.

41:46.211 --> 41:47.212
Yeah, me too.

41:47.812 --> 41:48.781
Until I remembered

41:48.981 --> 41:51.015
you tricked us into this
in the first place.

41:52.684 --> 41:54.049
You're coming back to my house

41:54.051 --> 41:56.084
and you're not leaving
until you explain

41:56.086 --> 41:58.089
exactly what just happened.

41:59.223 --> 42:00.857
<i>Now, rewind.</i>

42:00.859 --> 42:03.727
First. You want me
not to smash your faces in?

42:03.729 --> 42:04.926
Yes, please.

42:04.928 --> 42:07.631
Then you want us to skip
school tomorrow morning,

42:07.633 --> 42:09.832
go to Cornwall
with this freak new boy,

42:09.834 --> 42:12.801
find your long-lost dad,
kill some demon sorceress,

42:12.803 --> 42:15.303
- and save Britain from slavery?
- Yes.

42:15.305 --> 42:17.674
And out of all the people
in the entire world,

42:17.676 --> 42:19.808
even though there's already
a royal family,

42:19.810 --> 42:21.877
you're actually
the real, true king?

42:21.879 --> 42:24.546
Trust me,
I'm as shocked as you.

42:24.548 --> 42:25.948
Well, there's one thing
I don't get.

42:25.950 --> 42:29.352
Why would people like us...
help people like you?

42:29.354 --> 42:32.957
Yeah. Why would we, like,
even be seen with you?

42:33.758 --> 42:35.760
Because you're
the strongest people I know.

42:36.260 --> 42:39.296
In the heat of battle
we had each other's backs.

42:39.531 --> 42:40.863
We just saved
each other's lives

42:40.865 --> 42:42.633
without even
thinking about it.

42:42.867 --> 42:45.136
And that's exactly
what King Arthur did.

42:46.205 --> 42:49.074
He made his enemies
his allies.

42:49.841 --> 42:52.008
He united the warring
tribes of Britain

42:52.010 --> 42:54.276
and formed a band
of loyal knights.

42:54.278 --> 42:55.278
And together,

42:55.280 --> 42:57.649
they defeated an enemy
bigger than all of them.

42:57.982 --> 42:59.249
And think about it.

42:59.251 --> 43:00.915
King Arthur's
most loyal knights

43:00.917 --> 43:04.687
were called Lancelot,
Kay and Bedivere.

43:04.689 --> 43:05.754
So?

43:05.756 --> 43:07.358
So that's your names.

43:07.859 --> 43:10.129
Oh, my God. He's right.

43:10.629 --> 43:11.861
The legend says

43:11.863 --> 43:14.129
Arthur's knights gathered
at a round table

43:14.131 --> 43:15.900
so that they were all equal.

43:16.468 --> 43:17.536
And look...

43:21.272 --> 43:23.841
Quick, Bedders.
Lift up the flaps.

43:28.078 --> 43:31.015
See? None of this
happened by accident.

43:31.816 --> 43:33.351
This is destiny.

43:33.785 --> 43:35.154
This was meant to be.

43:38.222 --> 43:41.225
<i>So they
think themselves knights?</i>

43:41.626 --> 43:43.024
<i>How deluded they are.</i>

43:43.026 --> 43:44.225
<i>Deluded.</i>

43:44.227 --> 43:47.095
<i>The boy,
Beddersvere, is meek.</i>

43:47.097 --> 43:48.230
<i>Meek.</i>

43:48.232 --> 43:50.866
<i>Nothing
without his friend.</i>

43:50.868 --> 43:52.301
<i>Nothing.</i>

43:52.303 --> 43:54.404
<i>The boy, Lance,
is greedy.</i>

43:54.406 --> 43:55.106
<i>Greedy.</i>

43:55.472 --> 43:57.640
<i>He plans to take
the sword for himself.</i>

43:57.642 --> 43:59.276
<i>Take the sword.</i>

43:59.278 --> 44:02.645
<i>The girl, Kaye,
is clever but callow.</i>

44:02.647 --> 44:03.812
<i>Callow.</i>

44:03.814 --> 44:06.017
<i>Beholden to the boy.</i>

44:11.022 --> 44:16.128
<i>And the boy himself,
he clings to myth.</i>

44:17.361 --> 44:20.198
<i>Trusts in lies.</i>

44:21.798 --> 44:24.767
<i>I will prey
on their weaknesses.</i>

44:24.769 --> 44:26.102
<i>Weaknesses.</i>

44:26.104 --> 44:28.604
<i>Their faith
will crumble.</i>

44:28.606 --> 44:29.540
<i>Crumble.</i>

44:29.740 --> 44:33.109
<i>Their hope
will turn to hate.</i>

44:33.111 --> 44:34.343
<i>Hate.</i>

44:34.345 --> 44:39.147
<i>Their quest
will be their doom!</i>

45:25.162 --> 45:27.095
Oi! What do you think
you're doing?

45:29.234 --> 45:31.033
Bravo, Alexander.

45:31.035 --> 45:32.567
You've survived the night
unscathed,

45:32.569 --> 45:34.203
emerged with two new allies,

45:34.205 --> 45:36.104
and formulated
an excellent plan.

45:36.106 --> 45:39.174
To journey to Tintagel,
find your long-lost father,

45:39.176 --> 45:41.877
who will then help you find
the entrance to the Underworld

45:41.879 --> 45:43.714
and destroy Morgana.

45:43.914 --> 45:46.582
You think it's
an excellent plan? Really?

45:46.584 --> 45:47.385
Of course it is.

45:47.618 --> 45:50.687
Tintagel Island
is King Arthur's birthplace.

45:50.955 --> 45:52.723
It is strong in magic.

45:53.089 --> 45:55.559
The Mortes Milles
cannot touch you there.

45:56.060 --> 45:58.563
Sir Lance, Lady Kaye.

45:58.997 --> 46:00.962
A pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

46:00.964 --> 46:02.497
Do us a favor, Mertin.

46:02.499 --> 46:05.069
Don't talk to us. We're only
here for the fights.

46:05.269 --> 46:08.404
That's hardly the attitude
of a knight, young man.

46:08.406 --> 46:10.609
Where's your respect
for the Chivalric Code?

46:12.044 --> 46:14.946
Don't tell me you've never
heard of the Chivalric Code.

46:15.780 --> 46:18.482
Driver!
Stop this coach at once!

46:21.486 --> 46:24.720
The Code is the cornerstone
of a civilized society,

46:24.722 --> 46:27.524
the very credo upon which
this nation was built.

46:27.892 --> 46:30.091
If you don't know the Code,
then this entire enterprise

46:30.093 --> 46:31.227
is utterly hopeless!

46:31.229 --> 46:32.495
What the hell
is he on about?

46:32.497 --> 46:34.897
Excuse me, but why are we
getting off the coach?

46:34.899 --> 46:35.897
Shortcut.

46:35.899 --> 46:38.667
Follow me. Quickly.
No slacking.

46:41.805 --> 46:43.040
Halt!

46:43.607 --> 46:45.810
Now, pay close attention.

46:46.510 --> 46:48.944
The Chivalric Code
is the set of rules

46:48.946 --> 46:51.116
by which
all noble knights live.

46:51.383 --> 46:54.785
Obeying the Code from
the moment the sword is drawn

46:55.019 --> 46:57.022
is what makes you
pure of heart.

46:57.488 --> 47:01.124
And only a knight of
pure heart can slay Morgana.

47:01.126 --> 47:03.528
You must commit
the following to memory.

47:04.129 --> 47:07.365
Rule one.
Honor those you love.

47:07.564 --> 47:08.665
Easy.

47:08.899 --> 47:10.399
Yeah, because
you love yourself.

47:10.401 --> 47:14.035
Rule two.
Refrain from wanton offense.

47:14.037 --> 47:15.240
What's "wanton"?

47:15.439 --> 47:19.077
- It's Chinese food, I think.
- It is not Chinese food.

47:19.410 --> 47:22.678
"Wanton" means deliberate
or unprovoked.

47:22.680 --> 47:27.216
It means don't be rude or
swear or be nasty to people.

47:27.218 --> 47:28.920
All right. Don't look at me.

47:29.254 --> 47:30.555
Rule three.

47:31.055 --> 47:33.323
Speak the truth at all times.

47:33.624 --> 47:34.624
Easy, again.

47:34.959 --> 47:36.058
That's a lie.

47:36.060 --> 47:37.828
And finally, rule four.

47:38.530 --> 47:42.700
Persevere in any enterprise
until the end.

47:43.133 --> 47:45.301
Break any of these rules

47:45.303 --> 47:47.602
from the moment
the sword was drawn,

47:47.604 --> 47:50.608
and your quest is lost
before it has even begun.

47:51.676 --> 47:53.779
I trust that is not a problem.

47:58.015 --> 48:01.450
Oi! Mini Merlin!
What are you doing?

48:01.452 --> 48:03.353
We're not walking to Cornwall!

48:03.754 --> 48:05.556
Indeed, we are not.

48:06.022 --> 48:07.390
<i>And for centuries,</i>

48:07.392 --> 48:10.359
<i>historians have puzzled over
the purpose of Stonehenge.</i>

48:10.361 --> 48:12.864
Was it a temple?
A burial ground?

48:13.231 --> 48:14.663
Some sort of
astrological clock?

48:14.665 --> 48:17.265
No, it is not,
you ignorant buffoon!

48:17.267 --> 48:19.502
Stonehenge is
a transport hub.

48:19.504 --> 48:21.671
And just because the Romans
knocked half of it down,

48:21.673 --> 48:22.772
does not mean it's broken.

48:23.240 --> 48:25.207
Uh, excuse me!

48:25.209 --> 48:26.642
The general public's
not permitted

48:26.644 --> 48:29.745
to approach the stones without
the correct authorization!

48:34.785 --> 48:38.187
Hey, wait!
Security! Security!

48:38.189 --> 48:39.391
Come on!

48:43.394 --> 48:45.694
You see? They're all linked.

48:45.696 --> 48:48.665
All the Paleolithic standing
stones in the country.

48:48.667 --> 48:51.332
Built as a magical
conveyance system,

48:51.334 --> 48:53.537
designed by yours truly.

48:53.937 --> 48:56.004
We are now on Bodmin Moor,

48:56.006 --> 48:58.406
140 miles from Stonehenge

48:58.408 --> 49:00.075
and a mere, invigorating

49:00.077 --> 49:03.881
20-mile walk due west
to Tintagel Island!

49:04.182 --> 49:06.482
Ah...

49:06.484 --> 49:09.353
- What did he just say?
- Did he say a 20-mile walk?

49:09.720 --> 49:12.857
The most worthwhile path,
my young friends,

49:13.124 --> 49:15.059
is seldom the easiest.

49:15.859 --> 49:17.995
- Come on, Bedders.
- I'm coming.

49:18.828 --> 49:21.499
- Come on, Lance!
- I hate this already.

49:28.640 --> 49:31.540
This is further than
I've ever walked in my life.

49:31.542 --> 49:34.713
If I could get a signal,
I'd be in an Uber, right now.

49:35.946 --> 49:36.847
Perfect.

49:37.381 --> 49:39.781
- Let us stop here awhile.
- Oh, thank God!

49:42.118 --> 49:43.588
Not to rest.

49:43.854 --> 49:45.555
- To train!
- What?

49:45.557 --> 49:47.892
Alexander, hand me the sword.

49:49.359 --> 49:51.026
To learn the basics
of swordcraft,

49:51.028 --> 49:52.861
you will need a weapon, each.

49:52.863 --> 49:54.462
A simple duplication spell

49:54.464 --> 49:56.667
for metallic objects
should suffice.

49:57.935 --> 49:59.134
What are you doing, boy?

49:59.136 --> 50:01.102
I do magic tricks for a hobby,

50:01.104 --> 50:02.971
but I'm no good
at duplication illusions.

50:02.973 --> 50:06.042
So, I'm gonna video what
you do and try and copy it.

50:06.044 --> 50:08.312
I'll be most impressed
if you succeed.

50:15.986 --> 50:17.453
Wow!

50:17.455 --> 50:20.057
Now, you have
an army to fight,

50:20.290 --> 50:23.760
a demon to slay,
a country to save.

50:24.162 --> 50:25.230
So, let us begin.

50:25.696 --> 50:28.066
Your weapons are heavy
and cumbersome,

50:28.332 --> 50:30.167
but you are light and agile.

50:30.568 --> 50:32.303
Use this to your advantage.

50:32.569 --> 50:34.035
A grown warrior cannot block

50:34.037 --> 50:35.770
their whole body
with their blade.

50:35.772 --> 50:39.243
Nor can they use its weight
to hasten their speed.

50:39.778 --> 50:41.142
Use your wits.

50:41.144 --> 50:43.280
Be brave and resolute.

50:43.682 --> 50:46.050
And... good luck.

50:46.383 --> 50:47.618
Good luck with what?

50:56.026 --> 50:57.325
What's he doing?

51:15.044 --> 51:16.513
I'll fetch some food.

51:16.881 --> 51:20.085
A reward for once you've
vanquished your foes.

51:20.551 --> 51:22.183
I'm not
vanquishing anything.

51:22.185 --> 51:24.555
That's it for me.
I'm off.

51:26.990 --> 51:30.294
Oi! Get off me!

51:35.098 --> 51:36.001
Hey!

51:44.008 --> 51:45.542
Block the branches.

51:47.611 --> 51:50.749
- They're teaching us.
- I know.

51:58.789 --> 51:59.823
Come on then!

52:03.260 --> 52:04.361
You want it?

52:05.995 --> 52:06.962
Try some of this!

52:06.964 --> 52:08.033
Ah!

52:12.169 --> 52:13.570
Look what it's doing.

52:38.328 --> 52:39.497
Gotcha!

52:48.839 --> 52:53.478
<i>Their quest
will be their doom.</i>

53:00.651 --> 53:03.551
<i>The sword must be mine.</i>

53:03.553 --> 53:06.187
<i>Must be mine.</i>

53:10.093 --> 53:12.763
Help! Something's got me.

53:13.064 --> 53:15.066
Bedders, watch out!

53:16.901 --> 53:18.133
<i>Meek.</i>

53:20.338 --> 53:22.740
Lance! Kaye! Help!

53:23.441 --> 53:25.443
Help! Quickly!

53:25.977 --> 53:30.279
It's gonna get the sword.
I'm suffocating! Help!

53:30.281 --> 53:32.046
- Help!
- Hold them off.

53:32.048 --> 53:35.051
Help! Help us!

53:35.053 --> 53:36.588
Lance, help.

53:36.955 --> 53:39.824
<i>Take the sword and push.</i>

53:40.156 --> 53:41.057
Help me.

53:41.359 --> 53:43.058
If you're
the once and future king,

53:43.060 --> 53:44.128
you can help yourself.

53:44.461 --> 53:47.164
No. Lance! No!

53:50.100 --> 53:51.401
Lance!

53:51.702 --> 53:53.734
Lance!
What are you doing?

53:53.736 --> 53:54.803
Help!

53:54.805 --> 53:56.772
They'll kill you.
They'll kill us all.

53:56.774 --> 53:59.877
- Lance, help! Help!
- No!

54:03.647 --> 54:06.182
Come on, then!
Come and get it.

54:06.450 --> 54:08.549
Let's see what you've got,
you stupid twigs.

54:14.492 --> 54:17.258
Help me!
I can't breathe! Help!

54:17.260 --> 54:18.394
It's pulling me under!

54:18.396 --> 54:21.397
- Help! I can't breathe!
- Bedders! Lance!

54:21.399 --> 54:23.535
- Help me!
- Kaye!

54:24.702 --> 54:25.602
Help!

54:27.336 --> 54:28.371
Merlin!

54:28.705 --> 54:30.538
Merlin! Merlin!

54:30.540 --> 54:32.843
Merlin! Help us!

54:33.142 --> 54:34.508
I can't breathe!

54:34.510 --> 54:36.778
Merlin! Merlin!

54:36.780 --> 54:38.149
Help us!

54:38.883 --> 54:42.687
Merlin!
Help us!

54:43.053 --> 54:43.919
Merlin!

54:43.921 --> 54:45.723
Help us!
I can't breathe!

54:58.669 --> 55:00.638
Merlin. Look.

55:01.405 --> 55:02.506
Quickly!

55:03.607 --> 55:04.776
Merlin!

55:05.709 --> 55:08.046
Merlin.
Are you okay?

55:08.479 --> 55:11.082
She's even stronger
than I feared.

55:11.682 --> 55:13.149
We need beetle blood.

55:13.484 --> 55:15.920
Ground animal bone.
Something to revive him.

55:16.120 --> 55:18.823
It's no use. I'm finished.

55:19.289 --> 55:24.493
Until sunrise, you are alone.

55:30.401 --> 55:33.035
Merlin. Don't go.

55:33.037 --> 55:34.138
Merlin.

55:38.642 --> 55:41.646
If you'd helped me,
we could've fought them off.

55:42.513 --> 55:44.048
You nearly got us all killed.

55:44.414 --> 55:45.716
Give me the sword.

55:46.316 --> 55:47.217
No chance.

55:48.218 --> 55:49.553
Like I told you...

55:50.254 --> 55:51.689
I'm the king around here.

55:59.162 --> 56:00.764
Kaye, please.

56:05.870 --> 56:07.736
What are we
gonna do, Alex?

56:07.738 --> 56:09.906
Merlin's not coming
back till sunrise.

56:09.908 --> 56:12.674
The Mortes Milles
will come for us at sunset.

56:12.676 --> 56:13.642
And we haven't even

56:13.644 --> 56:14.879
- got the sword.
- Bedders.

56:15.713 --> 56:17.247
Please, I'm trying to think.

56:18.149 --> 56:19.150
Stop talking.

56:24.421 --> 56:25.321
No.

56:25.656 --> 56:27.488
You always tell me
to stop talking,

56:27.490 --> 56:29.259
and what I'm saying
is always right.

56:29.660 --> 56:31.095
And this time...

56:31.528 --> 56:33.630
This time I'm gonna do
something about it.

56:37.435 --> 56:38.569
Bedders, wait!

56:39.002 --> 56:40.669
The water's
getting deeper.

56:40.671 --> 56:42.138
I don't care.

56:42.539 --> 56:44.175
Give him back the sword.

56:45.977 --> 56:51.182
It's not yours. Alex drew it.
It chose him. It's his.

56:53.216 --> 56:54.718
Here we go again.

56:59.455 --> 57:00.658
That'll teach him.

57:01.792 --> 57:03.194
Leave him alone!

57:04.127 --> 57:07.598
I said, leave him alone.

57:08.700 --> 57:09.698
Why should we?

57:09.700 --> 57:11.635
Because you always
ruin everything.

57:11.968 --> 57:14.303
Because you're a liar
and a cheat and a bully.

57:14.305 --> 57:16.073
You're a bad person.

57:20.711 --> 57:22.711
I wish I'd never
asked you to join in.

57:22.713 --> 57:24.580
All you ever cared about
is yourself.

57:24.582 --> 57:26.381
Yeah? So what if I do?

57:26.383 --> 57:28.149
I know why
you're a bully

57:28.151 --> 57:30.618
and a cheat and a liar.

57:30.620 --> 57:32.356
I know why both of you are.

57:32.622 --> 57:34.122
It's because you're scared.

57:34.124 --> 57:36.857
You're scared
you're a nothing. A nobody.

57:36.859 --> 57:39.361
You're scared you're not gonna
get anywhere or be anyone.

57:39.363 --> 57:41.663
You think all that matters
is how strong you are

57:41.665 --> 57:42.765
and how much money you've got.

57:42.767 --> 57:44.499
Why don't you
shut up and fight?

57:44.501 --> 57:47.903
But it shouldn't be like that.
That's why the sword came.

57:47.905 --> 57:49.437
That's what we're
trying to change.

57:49.439 --> 57:51.841
Yeah? Well, who made you
better than everyone else?

57:51.843 --> 57:53.408
Who made you king?

58:08.124 --> 58:09.424
Lance, no!

58:21.539 --> 58:22.904
You broke it.

58:22.906 --> 58:24.374
You broke Excalibur.

58:25.943 --> 58:27.412
You broke everything.

58:37.720 --> 58:40.123
That's right.
Walk away.

58:40.658 --> 58:43.094
Look after yourself,
just like you always do.

58:44.194 --> 58:45.263
Maybe you're right.

58:46.930 --> 58:50.166
Maybe he is a liar
and a cheat and a bully.

58:50.568 --> 58:52.836
Maybe he is scared
and selfish.

58:53.537 --> 58:54.805
Maybe we both are.

58:55.738 --> 58:57.007
But why wouldn't we be?

58:57.740 --> 58:59.142
That is how the world works.

58:59.377 --> 59:02.914
Nothing you or anyone does
is ever gonna change that.

59:03.613 --> 59:05.215
I'm sorry we picked on you.

59:05.948 --> 59:07.851
I'm sorry he broke the sword.

59:08.586 --> 59:10.020
But we're not knights.

59:10.821 --> 59:12.890
We never were,
and we never will be.

59:13.723 --> 59:15.292
You're better off without us.

59:15.691 --> 59:18.261
No. You're wrong.

59:18.763 --> 59:20.565
We can't do this without you.

59:20.897 --> 59:23.066
You're Sir Lancelot
and Lady Kaye.

59:23.434 --> 59:24.868
We need you!

59:26.470 --> 59:27.905
It's too late.

59:29.272 --> 59:30.274
No, it's not.

59:31.209 --> 59:32.276
Give me my book.

59:33.142 --> 59:35.112
The book always knows
what to do.

59:39.283 --> 59:41.953
The Lady of the Lake,
Excalibur's guardian.

59:43.553 --> 59:47.225
She's in every body of water.
So maybe she's in this one.

59:48.559 --> 59:50.627
If I'm the once
and future king...

59:51.060 --> 59:53.696
if Lance and Kaye and Bedders

59:53.964 --> 59:57.566
are my loyal and brave
and worthy knights,

59:57.568 --> 59:59.535
and if this is our destiny...

01:00:00.002 --> 01:00:01.472
then, Lady of the Lake...

01:00:02.439 --> 01:00:04.040
return Excalibur.

01:00:16.986 --> 01:00:19.389
I thought something
magic was gonna happen.

01:00:20.323 --> 01:00:21.224
Oh, well.

01:00:22.026 --> 01:00:23.528
It was worth a try.

01:00:40.077 --> 01:00:40.977
Hey.

01:00:41.477 --> 01:00:43.377
- Hey!
- Alex!

01:00:43.379 --> 01:00:44.281
Bedders!

01:00:53.823 --> 01:00:55.026
Wow.

01:01:02.533 --> 01:01:03.835
I think that's yours.

01:01:07.703 --> 01:01:09.039
And this is yours.

01:01:34.097 --> 01:01:35.663
We're dry.

01:01:35.665 --> 01:01:38.301
From now on,
we stick together.

01:01:38.702 --> 01:01:40.000
As equals.

01:01:40.002 --> 01:01:42.805
No dishonor. No lying.

01:01:43.106 --> 01:01:46.209
No wanton offense.
And no giving up.

01:01:46.676 --> 01:01:47.944
Swear it.

01:01:48.812 --> 01:01:50.114
I swear.

01:01:52.182 --> 01:01:53.384
I swear.

01:01:54.885 --> 01:01:56.752
I thought we weren't
supposed to swear.

01:01:56.754 --> 01:01:57.955
Lance.

01:02:10.566 --> 01:02:11.468
Hey.

01:02:13.002 --> 01:02:14.939
Are you kids okay?

01:02:16.039 --> 01:02:18.641
Thank you. Thank you, God.

01:02:19.276 --> 01:02:21.444
You look like
you've been through the wars.

01:02:22.144 --> 01:02:25.748
What was it, then?
Activity day? School trip?

01:02:26.182 --> 01:02:28.251
Did you get separated
or something?

01:02:28.685 --> 01:02:29.687
Listen...

01:02:30.687 --> 01:02:32.088
this is gonna sound
really weird,

01:02:32.421 --> 01:02:35.357
but if all four of us
and these ponies disappear,

01:02:35.359 --> 01:02:36.390
don't worry.

01:02:36.392 --> 01:02:38.528
I promise we'll
get them back to you.

01:02:39.129 --> 01:02:40.431
I beg your pardon?

01:02:47.338 --> 01:02:49.537
Whoa.
They just vanished.

01:02:49.539 --> 01:02:51.441
Alex, the sword.

01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:56.245
Guys, I think we're gonna
have to learn how to ride.

01:02:56.979 --> 01:02:58.712
These ponies
are way too small.

01:02:58.714 --> 01:02:59.913
They're for little girls.

01:02:59.915 --> 01:03:01.915
Those dead things
were double the size.

01:03:01.917 --> 01:03:04.051
Do it like
show jumpers on TV.

01:03:04.053 --> 01:03:06.087
Left rein to go left,
right rein to go right,

01:03:06.089 --> 01:03:07.790
bounce up and down
in the saddle.

01:03:08.191 --> 01:03:11.127
They're coming. I can feel it.

01:03:15.899 --> 01:03:17.265
Meek.

01:03:17.267 --> 01:03:20.071
They're here!

01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:23.571
They're right
behind us.

01:03:23.573 --> 01:03:25.076
Go, go, gallop!

01:03:27.477 --> 01:03:28.944
I don't know what
I'm doing.

01:03:28.946 --> 01:03:30.479
I can't do this!

01:03:30.481 --> 01:03:31.615
I'm gonna fall off!

01:03:35.986 --> 01:03:38.388
Greedy. Greedy.

01:03:40.723 --> 01:03:41.689
Callow.

01:03:42.926 --> 01:03:45.227
This way, into the forest!

01:03:45.229 --> 01:03:47.397
The trees will slow them down!

01:03:53.636 --> 01:03:56.272
Come on,
my little pony. Go faster!

01:03:56.606 --> 01:03:57.707
They're catching up!

01:04:05.881 --> 01:04:09.753
His quest will be his doom.

01:04:15.959 --> 01:04:17.294
I got one!

01:04:18.062 --> 01:04:19.630
He got one!

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.066
Bedders has fallen off!

01:04:25.068 --> 01:04:27.267
Go get him.
We'll distract them.

01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:29.072
They'll follow the sword.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.675
Bedders, I'm coming for you!

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:38.281
Meek.

01:04:42.852 --> 01:04:45.488
Faster, Alex! Faster.

01:04:46.022 --> 01:04:47.522
Nothing.

01:04:52.127 --> 01:04:53.530
Come on, Bedders.

01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:58.435
Go, go!

01:05:07.243 --> 01:05:09.280
Bedders, you made it.

01:05:13.684 --> 01:05:14.584
Oh, no.

01:05:20.723 --> 01:05:21.859
Jump!

01:05:33.035 --> 01:05:35.303
I did it! I did it!

01:05:35.305 --> 01:05:37.675
Ride!
As fast as you can.

01:06:04.066 --> 01:06:05.401
I've got an idea.

01:06:05.736 --> 01:06:07.504
Get off. Follow me.

01:06:11.341 --> 01:06:13.577
- What's he doing?
- Alex!

01:06:19.015 --> 01:06:20.316
Let's go!

01:06:53.383 --> 01:06:56.520
There it is.
Tintagel Island.

01:07:05.694 --> 01:07:06.729
You know...

01:07:07.597 --> 01:07:10.233
we really should
huddle together for warmth.

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.703
No way. I'm not huddling
with anyone.

01:07:14.638 --> 01:07:15.973
I don't huddle.

01:07:51.975 --> 01:07:53.544
Good luck, Alex.

01:08:27.977 --> 01:08:29.511
Stay. Stay.

01:08:32.781 --> 01:08:33.915
Hello.

01:08:33.917 --> 01:08:35.718
I wonder if you can help me.

01:08:36.986 --> 01:08:38.555
My name's Alexander Elliot.

01:08:39.087 --> 01:08:40.857
I'm looking for my father.

01:08:43.325 --> 01:08:45.127
You don't remember me,
do you?

01:08:45.428 --> 01:08:46.594
I'm Sophie.

01:08:46.595 --> 01:08:48.964
I'm your aunt.
I'm your dad's sister.

01:08:49.997 --> 01:08:53.835
Sorry if I'm staring,
but you look just like him.

01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:56.807
I have to talk to him.
It's important.

01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.941
More important than anything
in the world.

01:08:59.943 --> 01:09:03.814
You came all the way here
from London by yourself?

01:09:04.212 --> 01:09:05.915
Does your mum even know
you're here?

01:09:07.617 --> 01:09:09.250
All right,
then we have to call her.

01:09:09.252 --> 01:09:11.455
No, this is nothing
to do with her.

01:09:12.955 --> 01:09:13.923
Please don't.

01:09:14.323 --> 01:09:16.526
This is something
I have to do on my own.

01:09:17.292 --> 01:09:20.328
Well, what did your mum
tell you about him?

01:09:20.330 --> 01:09:22.533
She said they were too young
when they had me.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.968
He had other things
going on in his life.

01:09:26.535 --> 01:09:28.305
She said he was
battling demons.

01:09:28.638 --> 01:09:30.406
I didn't know what
she meant...

01:09:30.872 --> 01:09:31.841
but I do now.

01:09:32.175 --> 01:09:33.273
You do?

01:09:33.274 --> 01:09:35.745
It's okay. You don't
have to lie to me.

01:09:36.245 --> 01:09:37.712
I know who he really was.

01:09:37.948 --> 01:09:40.017
Then why would you
want to find him?

01:09:40.948 --> 01:09:41.952
What do you mean?

01:09:44.421 --> 01:09:45.622
He drank.

01:09:46.321 --> 01:09:49.493
He was angry at everything
and everyone.

01:09:50.225 --> 01:09:52.363
He wasn't a good man, Alex.

01:09:53.629 --> 01:09:56.266
He lived here
for a while, years back.

01:09:56.867 --> 01:09:59.867
That's when your mum
brought you to see him.

01:09:59.869 --> 01:10:03.540
She thought he might've
changed, but he hadn't.

01:10:04.274 --> 01:10:06.443
I don't even know
where he is anymore.

01:10:07.377 --> 01:10:10.481
Like you said,
he had his demons.

01:10:11.647 --> 01:10:13.717
But I meant real demons.

01:10:13.984 --> 01:10:15.517
Magical demons,

01:10:15.985 --> 01:10:17.550
like King Arthur fought.

01:10:17.552 --> 01:10:19.422
Like in the book he gave me.

01:10:22.992 --> 01:10:26.729
You don't understand.
I'm the once and future king,

01:10:27.029 --> 01:10:28.130
and he knew.

01:10:28.765 --> 01:10:32.136
He wrote me this message
and he's waiting for me.

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.475
But, Alex...

01:10:39.175 --> 01:10:40.977
your mum bought you this book.

01:10:42.111 --> 01:10:43.846
This is her writing.

01:10:46.615 --> 01:10:48.148
- I want it!
- Mine!

01:10:48.150 --> 01:10:50.617
- I wanna be king.
- I wanna be queen.

01:10:50.619 --> 01:10:52.252
I wanna be a king.

01:10:52.254 --> 01:10:54.022
Alex, what happened?

01:10:54.024 --> 01:10:55.926
- Did you find him?
- What did he say?

01:11:15.511 --> 01:11:17.047
My dad's not here.

01:11:18.248 --> 01:11:19.783
And he's not a hero.

01:11:21.083 --> 01:11:22.586
He didn't care about me.

01:11:22.886 --> 01:11:24.788
And he didn't want to know me.

01:11:25.888 --> 01:11:28.091
He didn't even
give me the book.

01:11:32.361 --> 01:11:33.997
My mum lied to me.

01:11:34.964 --> 01:11:36.165
It's all a lie.

01:11:38.368 --> 01:11:39.736
I hate her!

01:11:48.345 --> 01:11:50.379
Hey, Alex.

01:11:50.913 --> 01:11:52.748
I have to show you something.

01:11:53.417 --> 01:11:54.885
Hold out your hand.

01:11:59.489 --> 01:12:01.625
Now squeeze
as hard as you can.

01:12:14.637 --> 01:12:16.239
And open your hand.

01:12:20.976 --> 01:12:25.313
I did it. I couldn't sleep,
so I practiced and practiced,

01:12:25.315 --> 01:12:26.781
and now I can do it.

01:12:26.783 --> 01:12:28.852
I can do real magic.

01:12:31.486 --> 01:12:34.024
You can't give up,
it's not allowed.

01:12:34.457 --> 01:12:37.427
We're Han and Chewie,
Frodo and Samwise.

01:12:37.627 --> 01:12:41.097
We can't give up because...
look how far we've come.

01:12:42.598 --> 01:12:43.632
He's right.

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:47.102
You've survived three nights
against the Mortes Milles.

01:12:47.104 --> 01:12:48.435
Hundreds of them.

01:12:48.437 --> 01:12:50.371
All leathery and on fire,

01:12:50.373 --> 01:12:53.076
with their faces half
falling off and everything.

01:12:53.342 --> 01:12:54.577
You got us here.

01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:57.412
You turned us from enemies
into allies,

01:12:57.646 --> 01:13:00.316
just like King Arthur did,
just like in the legend.

01:13:01.717 --> 01:13:05.788
You drew Excalibur, Alex.
Nothing else matters.

01:13:07.190 --> 01:13:10.227
This book
you covet, Alexander...

01:13:10.894 --> 01:13:11.962
Not bad.

01:13:12.628 --> 01:13:15.497
Pretty illustrations, but...

01:13:16.132 --> 01:13:20.070
...not entirely accurate.

01:13:20.637 --> 01:13:24.738
Remember, legends
are mere rumors

01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:26.341
whispered down the centuries.

01:13:26.676 --> 01:13:29.643
Written and rewritten,
told and retold.

01:13:29.645 --> 01:13:32.013
Sometimes by
the rich and powerful

01:13:32.015 --> 01:13:34.717
so they can hold on to power.

01:13:35.051 --> 01:13:38.219
The sword doesn't care
who your parents are.

01:13:38.221 --> 01:13:42.456
It doesn't choose
by birth or blood, Alexander,

01:13:42.458 --> 01:13:45.128
but by heart and mind.

01:13:45.662 --> 01:13:50.734
If your legends say different,
then perhaps...

01:13:51.501 --> 01:13:53.803
you must write them anew.

01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:02.745
But we're right back
where we started.

01:14:02.979 --> 01:14:05.481
We don't know where the
entrance to the Underworld is

01:14:05.681 --> 01:14:07.751
and there's only one more
night until the eclipse.

01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:10.283
You're a king, Alexander.

01:14:10.285 --> 01:14:12.387
A leader, not a follower.

01:14:12.654 --> 01:14:14.456
You need nothing

01:14:14.891 --> 01:14:17.694
but that which
you already have.

01:14:27.235 --> 01:14:28.238
I've got it.

01:14:28.770 --> 01:14:31.407
I know. I know where it is.

01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:34.608
That's lovely.

01:14:37.046 --> 01:14:39.682
Excuse me, please.
Sorry, this is an emergency.

01:14:40.048 --> 01:14:40.749
Sorry.

01:14:41.083 --> 01:14:42.349
Stand back, please.
We're on a mission.

01:14:42.351 --> 01:14:44.921
Clear some space,
quick as you can. Thank you.

01:14:46.155 --> 01:14:47.356
It's the same place.

01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:51.160
Glastonbury Tor.

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:53.930
That's where
Arthur fought Morgana.

01:14:54.931 --> 01:14:57.630
Lance, Kaye,
go along the cliff,

01:14:57.632 --> 01:14:59.133
find the horses
and tie them up

01:14:59.135 --> 01:15:00.867
at the top of the high street,
then meet us

01:15:00.869 --> 01:15:02.270
at the amusement arcade.

01:15:02.605 --> 01:15:05.042
Bedders, you come with me.

01:15:07.677 --> 01:15:08.812
We're knights.

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:13.082
We've got a quest to finish.

01:15:31.467 --> 01:15:34.203
All clear.
Do it, Bedders. Go.

01:15:44.146 --> 01:15:45.246
It's working.

01:15:45.248 --> 01:15:48.085
Bedders, you're a genius.

01:16:04.534 --> 01:16:05.599
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:16:05.601 --> 01:16:06.502
Hello.

01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:07.902
We'd like to buy
some armor, please.

01:16:07.904 --> 01:16:09.372
Do you take 50p pieces?

01:16:56.919 --> 01:17:00.054
The sun sets.
And if you do not defeat her,

01:17:00.056 --> 01:17:01.825
then it sets
for the last time.

01:17:02.324 --> 01:17:05.995
For tomorrow, the moon masks
the sun and all is lost.

01:17:06.895 --> 01:17:09.498
<i>This battle is yours, not mine.</i>

01:17:10.867 --> 01:17:12.269
<i>Journey with care...</i>

01:17:13.369 --> 01:17:15.971
<i>be brave, chivalrous...</i>

01:17:16.838 --> 01:17:19.141
<i>and remember the Code.</i>

01:17:49.338 --> 01:17:50.506
There's no doorway.

01:17:50.905 --> 01:17:52.374
There's nothing here.

01:17:52.976 --> 01:17:54.474
I don't understand.

01:17:56.312 --> 01:17:57.980
Alex, look.

01:18:04.986 --> 01:18:06.355
Let me try something.

01:18:29.779 --> 01:18:31.614
This is too creepy.

01:18:32.382 --> 01:18:35.285
It's like no one's
been down here for centuries.

01:18:35.552 --> 01:18:37.320
Not since the Dark Ages,

01:18:37.852 --> 01:18:39.556
when Arthur trapped Morgana.

01:18:40.589 --> 01:18:42.124
We're the very first.

01:18:43.793 --> 01:18:45.127
Four doorways.

01:18:45.628 --> 01:18:46.893
Maybe we take one each.

01:18:46.895 --> 01:18:48.327
What if it's a trick?

01:18:48.329 --> 01:18:50.296
What if she's trying
to separate us?

01:18:50.298 --> 01:18:53.569
Right. We should stick
together, whatever happens.

01:18:53.869 --> 01:18:56.338
But... which door?

01:18:59.941 --> 01:19:02.511
Wait. The sword will tell us.

01:19:11.654 --> 01:19:14.023
It's this way,
behind the vines.

01:19:52.794 --> 01:19:54.562
Look at the walls.

01:19:54.564 --> 01:19:56.066
They're moving.

01:19:56.832 --> 01:19:58.535
They're coming for us.

01:20:03.873 --> 01:20:05.473
They're everywhere!

01:20:08.144 --> 01:20:10.512
Stay close. Form a circle.

01:20:16.084 --> 01:20:17.518
There's too many!

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:19.723
Lance!

01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:26.662
Kaye!

01:20:27.129 --> 01:20:28.765
Alex!

01:20:29.531 --> 01:20:31.101
They've got me!

01:20:34.003 --> 01:20:35.768
Alex, look!

01:20:37.007 --> 01:20:39.273
You have to go. Now.

01:20:39.275 --> 01:20:40.744
I'll hold them off.

01:20:41.578 --> 01:20:42.479
Now!

01:20:43.579 --> 01:20:44.748
Go get her!

01:21:29.225 --> 01:21:31.727
Alex! Alex, we're up here!

01:21:31.927 --> 01:21:33.063
Alex!

01:21:33.663 --> 01:21:35.732
She's here! Be careful!

01:21:36.699 --> 01:21:38.802
Let them go!

01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:03.991
Welcome, boy.

01:22:03.993 --> 01:22:06.794
<i>Boy.</i>

01:22:06.796 --> 01:22:08.496
I've been watching you.

01:22:08.498 --> 01:22:10.863
<i>You.</i>

01:22:10.865 --> 01:22:14.068
You've traveled so far.

01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:16.001
<i>So far.</i>

01:22:16.003 --> 01:22:18.839
Fought so bravely.

01:22:18.841 --> 01:22:20.340
<i>Bravely.</i>

01:22:20.342 --> 01:22:22.812
I've seen your world.

01:22:23.779 --> 01:22:25.447
How you live.

01:22:25.981 --> 01:22:27.716
The myths you believe.

01:22:28.751 --> 01:22:30.386
Who you trust.

01:22:31.721 --> 01:22:35.859
It's all lies.

01:22:37.994 --> 01:22:40.429
Merlin lied to you.

01:22:40.729 --> 01:22:42.932
Your mother lied to you.

01:22:43.598 --> 01:22:48.137
You have no noble blood,
you have no army.

01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:51.505
You can't win.

01:22:55.977 --> 01:22:59.481
The world is rotten,
Alexander.

01:23:00.016 --> 01:23:01.383
That's not true!

01:23:01.617 --> 01:23:03.218
Oh, but it is.

01:23:06.622 --> 01:23:09.723
You sought the truth, child,

01:23:09.725 --> 01:23:11.260
and you have found it.

01:23:11.793 --> 01:23:14.495
- You are nothing...
- <i>Nothing.</i>

01:23:14.497 --> 01:23:17.197
- ...but a lowborn serf.
- <i>Serf.</i>

01:23:17.199 --> 01:23:20.399
- Know your place.
- Place.

01:23:20.401 --> 01:23:25.440
I am
the last living Pendragon.

01:24:02.244 --> 01:24:04.714
The land is mine.

01:24:05.047 --> 01:24:07.883
The sword is mine.

01:24:08.284 --> 01:24:10.853
You are mine.

01:24:14.824 --> 01:24:15.857
You're right.

01:24:18.827 --> 01:24:19.896
I'm nothing.

01:24:26.502 --> 01:24:27.537
Take it.

01:24:51.526 --> 01:24:55.464
Lance, Bedders, Kaye, quickly!
This way! Hurry!

01:25:23.825 --> 01:25:24.993
I think we did it.

01:25:25.328 --> 01:25:27.030
That was amazing.

01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:30.732
All hail the once
and future king.

01:25:35.404 --> 01:25:37.906
No, please don't.

01:25:38.406 --> 01:25:40.909
Really, it's embarrassing.

01:25:44.579 --> 01:25:46.446
If they catch us
with Excalibur,

01:25:46.448 --> 01:25:47.846
they'll take it away.

01:25:47.848 --> 01:25:49.950
- We can't risk it.
- You're right.

01:25:49.952 --> 01:25:53.252
Is the Lady of the Lake
really in every body of water

01:25:53.254 --> 01:25:54.720
in the whole of Britain?

01:25:54.722 --> 01:25:56.723
Like, even
in a swimming pool?

01:25:56.725 --> 01:25:58.895
- Or a bucket of water?
- Or a puddle?

01:25:59.762 --> 01:26:00.797
Stand back.

01:26:10.239 --> 01:26:11.708
Guess that's a "yes," then.

01:26:18.012 --> 01:26:19.414
See you, sword.

01:26:20.281 --> 01:26:21.818
See you when we see you.

01:26:34.230 --> 01:26:35.830
Where are you going, Alex?

01:26:36.297 --> 01:26:37.531
Aren't you going home?

01:26:37.865 --> 01:26:41.367
I'm going over the walls.
Then through the back window.

01:26:41.369 --> 01:26:42.570
Why?

01:26:43.004 --> 01:26:44.673
I can't face her, Bedders.

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:48.176
Not tonight. I'm too tired.

01:26:48.677 --> 01:26:50.279
What are you going
to tell her?

01:26:50.678 --> 01:26:53.147
The same as you.
The truth.

01:26:53.582 --> 01:26:55.985
They won't believe us.
No one will.

01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:58.521
So what?

01:26:59.521 --> 01:27:00.856
It's over now.

01:27:02.257 --> 01:27:03.926
Good night, Sir Beddersvere.

01:27:07.596 --> 01:27:09.464
That was a great adventure.

01:27:09.966 --> 01:27:12.702
Yeah, it really was.

01:27:13.503 --> 01:27:15.171
Good night,
Your Highness-ness.

01:28:32.147 --> 01:28:35.048
It didn't work.
She's not dead.

01:28:35.050 --> 01:28:35.952
No.

01:28:36.985 --> 01:28:38.518
You merely wounded her.

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.386
Her fury and resolve
are doubled

01:28:40.388 --> 01:28:42.087
and the eclipse
is in six hours.

01:28:42.089 --> 01:28:45.326
But why? I did everything
you told me to do.

01:28:45.328 --> 01:28:47.530
Think, boy. Think!

01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:49.832
The Code.

01:28:50.732 --> 01:28:52.601
It must be the Code.

01:28:53.502 --> 01:28:56.873
But... I refrained
from wanton offense.

01:28:57.739 --> 01:28:59.908
I spoke the truth
at all times.

01:29:00.508 --> 01:29:01.843
I persevered...

01:29:05.513 --> 01:29:07.048
"Honor those you love."

01:29:17.193 --> 01:29:18.194
Mum.

01:29:22.797 --> 01:29:23.798
Alex.

01:29:27.569 --> 01:29:29.370
How could you do this?

01:29:29.570 --> 01:29:30.836
The police have been
looking for you.

01:29:30.838 --> 01:29:32.237
I've been worried sick.

01:29:33.307 --> 01:29:35.211
Oh, thank God you're back.

01:29:37.846 --> 01:29:40.883
Mum, I've got something
to tell you.

01:29:42.516 --> 01:29:44.619
We went on a quest
to Tintagel.

01:29:45.387 --> 01:29:46.856
I met my Aunt Sophie.

01:29:47.256 --> 01:29:49.124
I know. She called.

01:29:49.658 --> 01:29:51.327
I know you lied to me
about the book.

01:29:52.394 --> 01:29:53.296
I know...

01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:56.265
he didn't even sign it.

01:29:57.431 --> 01:29:58.700
You did.

01:30:00.168 --> 01:30:04.272
I know Dad didn't care
about neither of us.

01:30:05.708 --> 01:30:07.610
I'm so sorry, Alex.

01:30:08.243 --> 01:30:10.346
I'm sorry I lied, I just...

01:30:11.713 --> 01:30:16.584
I... I just... I wanted you
to believe he was good.

01:30:16.952 --> 01:30:19.252
I thought that if you
knew the truth,

01:30:19.254 --> 01:30:22.056
it would hurt you, change you.

01:30:22.324 --> 01:30:24.860
No, I'm sorry.

01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:27.796
I'm sorry I was
angry with you.

01:30:29.498 --> 01:30:30.967
Nothing's your fault.

01:30:31.967 --> 01:30:32.868
Nothing.

01:30:36.437 --> 01:30:38.339
You were just trying
to protect me.

01:30:38.606 --> 01:30:40.810
But you don't need to anymore.

01:30:46.882 --> 01:30:48.651
There's something
I have to do.

01:30:50.119 --> 01:30:51.287
I have to go to school.

01:30:52.419 --> 01:30:53.888
And I have to take the sword.

01:31:05.467 --> 01:31:06.469
Alex...

01:31:06.968 --> 01:31:09.102
we have to have a serious talk
about that sword

01:31:09.104 --> 01:31:11.404
and this whole
King Arthur thing.

01:31:11.406 --> 01:31:14.275
We will. But I have to
show you something first.

01:31:17.245 --> 01:31:19.815
Everything I said
about the sword is true.

01:31:20.348 --> 01:31:21.283
I can prove it.

01:31:21.516 --> 01:31:23.049
But first, we have to promise

01:31:23.051 --> 01:31:24.720
never to lie to each other
ever again.

01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:28.190
To always trust each other,
whatever happens.

01:31:28.656 --> 01:31:29.990
Do you promise?

01:31:29.992 --> 01:31:31.060
I promise.

01:31:31.694 --> 01:31:32.928
I promise, too.

01:31:33.561 --> 01:31:35.163
Now, don't freak out, okay?

01:31:38.766 --> 01:31:39.968
Lady of the Lake...

01:31:40.769 --> 01:31:42.404
this is Alexander Elliot.

01:31:42.937 --> 01:31:45.306
If my quest is noble and true,

01:31:46.341 --> 01:31:47.943
please return Excalibur.

01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:12.266
All the time I was
telling you to obey the Code,

01:32:12.667 --> 01:32:14.202
I'd broken it myself.

01:32:14.636 --> 01:32:15.935
Morgana's not dead.

01:32:15.937 --> 01:32:17.469
- Oh, no.
- You're kidding.

01:32:17.471 --> 01:32:18.773
She's coming back...

01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:20.709
into the real world.

01:32:21.443 --> 01:32:23.044
That's why we need defenses.

01:32:24.312 --> 01:32:26.612
A fortress, a castle.

01:32:26.614 --> 01:32:28.147
The Mortes Milles will rise

01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:30.386
from the land
across the roadway.

01:32:30.619 --> 01:32:32.054
They'll attack head-on

01:32:32.488 --> 01:32:34.821
in a great and terrible
multitude.

01:32:34.823 --> 01:32:37.092
The eclipse gives us
one advantage.

01:32:37.458 --> 01:32:38.894
It's not night or day.

01:32:39.261 --> 01:32:42.330
So this time,
Merlin can fight beside us.

01:32:43.766 --> 01:32:46.502
But the five of us won't stand
a chance on our own.

01:32:47.002 --> 01:32:48.803
We need to raise an army.

01:32:50.672 --> 01:32:53.206
I'm relying on you
three to set a good example.

01:32:53.208 --> 01:32:55.407
So when the entire school's
out in the playground

01:32:55.409 --> 01:32:58.678
watching the eclipse,
everyone behaves themselves.

01:32:58.680 --> 01:32:59.813
Is that clear?

01:32:59.815 --> 01:33:01.415
- Yes, Miss.
- Okay, Miss.

01:33:02.050 --> 01:33:04.954
Why are all these
children walking towards us?

01:33:09.891 --> 01:33:13.395
And what on earth
are you children doing,

01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:17.331
turning up to school
in the middle of the morning

01:33:17.333 --> 01:33:18.734
dressed like that?

01:33:19.234 --> 01:33:21.268
Saving Britain
from eternal slavery

01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:23.439
by an ancient,
undead evil, Miss.

01:33:29.077 --> 01:33:33.214
Break is over. Quickly
and quietly fall in line.

01:33:36.385 --> 01:33:39.221
Get in line. Break is over.

01:33:45.627 --> 01:33:48.964
Everyone, gather round.

01:33:49.396 --> 01:33:50.533
Quickly now.

01:33:52.734 --> 01:33:55.805
This boy has
a very important announcement.

01:33:57.638 --> 01:34:00.008
My name is Alexander Elliot.

01:34:01.109 --> 01:34:04.446
A few days ago,
I found a sword in a stone.

01:34:05.114 --> 01:34:07.915
Then I found out it wasn't
just any sword in a stone,

01:34:08.216 --> 01:34:10.352
it was the Sword
in the Stone...

01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:12.721
Excalibur.

01:34:14.323 --> 01:34:18.426
I know, I know,
I know it sounds ridiculous,

01:34:18.793 --> 01:34:21.530
but it's true,
and I can prove it.

01:34:22.663 --> 01:34:24.300
This boy, Mertin,

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:26.334
is really the wizard, Merlin.

01:34:26.702 --> 01:34:29.271
And if you don't believe me,

01:34:29.570 --> 01:34:30.605
then just watch.

01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:48.522
How humiliating.

01:34:48.789 --> 01:34:51.292
Quiet. Quiet. Listen.

01:34:52.427 --> 01:34:55.163
This country is in danger.

01:34:55.663 --> 01:34:57.565
A sorceress called Morgana

01:34:57.999 --> 01:35:00.868
has been sleeping
under our soil for centuries,

01:35:01.535 --> 01:35:06.341
waiting for her moment
to return and enslave us.

01:35:06.675 --> 01:35:08.476
And that moment has come.

01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:12.147
In two hours,
there will be an eclipse.

01:35:12.913 --> 01:35:15.782
Morgana and her army
of undead knights

01:35:15.784 --> 01:35:17.286
will attack the school.

01:35:17.985 --> 01:35:21.355
We need you
to help us defeat her.

01:35:21.623 --> 01:35:25.427
All you have to do is kneel
and let Alex knight you.

01:35:26.194 --> 01:35:30.330
Everyone who does
gets a sword and armor.

01:35:30.597 --> 01:35:32.066
This isn't a game.

01:35:32.534 --> 01:35:34.302
This is 100% for real.

01:35:34.869 --> 01:35:37.838
Flaming swords,
fire-breathing horses.

01:35:38.105 --> 01:35:40.441
So, don't step up
unless you're ready.

01:35:40.876 --> 01:35:43.412
Me and Bedders
used to hate Lance and Kaye.

01:35:44.012 --> 01:35:47.382
And they hated us.
We were sworn enemies.

01:35:47.882 --> 01:35:50.218
But now we know
that's how evil tricks you.

01:35:51.253 --> 01:35:53.752
It turns people
against each other

01:35:53.754 --> 01:35:55.489
to distract them from itself.

01:35:56.123 --> 01:35:59.591
Because it knows
that if we fight together,

01:35:59.593 --> 01:36:01.596
it doesn't stand a chance.

01:36:02.263 --> 01:36:04.298
So, who will stand
with us today?

01:36:05.065 --> 01:36:07.733
Who will stand up
to save their friends,

01:36:07.735 --> 01:36:10.439
their future, their country?

01:36:11.105 --> 01:36:12.607
Who will join us?

01:36:14.309 --> 01:36:17.111
Nah.

01:36:18.145 --> 01:36:20.048
<i>Activa.</i>

01:36:20.682 --> 01:36:22.117
And, by the way,

01:36:22.484 --> 01:36:25.520
this is instead of
lessons today.

01:36:34.395 --> 01:36:36.529
Excuse me, Pam, forgive us
if we're speaking out of turn.

01:36:36.531 --> 01:36:38.598
I thought we were taking an
hour out to watch the eclipse.

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:40.901
No one said anything about any
kind of historical reenactment.

01:36:40.903 --> 01:36:42.301
My Year 11's are meant to be
off-timetable

01:36:42.303 --> 01:36:44.804
for intensive revision.

01:36:44.806 --> 01:36:46.104
I just had all of these
made up.

01:36:46.106 --> 01:36:47.376
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:36:47.676 --> 01:36:49.511
If I could have your attention
for a moment...

01:36:56.784 --> 01:36:57.850
What's your name?

01:36:57.852 --> 01:36:58.753
Hector.

01:37:00.588 --> 01:37:02.455
I knight thee, Sir Hector.

01:37:02.457 --> 01:37:03.258
Take a shield.

01:37:03.591 --> 01:37:05.694
Take a shield,
move on to the next table.

01:37:14.970 --> 01:37:17.170
Take a sword. Good.

01:37:17.172 --> 01:37:18.507
Take a sword.

01:37:19.807 --> 01:37:22.376
Set the barricades!
Lay the ropes!

01:37:22.378 --> 01:37:23.577
Go, go, go!

01:37:23.579 --> 01:37:26.411
Tie two ropes
on each vaulting horse.

01:37:26.413 --> 01:37:29.684
Quick as you can,
then get ready to hoist!

01:37:36.525 --> 01:37:38.425
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:37:38.427 --> 01:37:41.027
I don't suppose
I could possibly borrow

01:37:41.029 --> 01:37:42.698
everyone's car keys, could I?

01:37:44.466 --> 01:37:46.733
Come on.
First car on the left.

01:37:46.735 --> 01:37:48.100
You guys, first on the right.

01:37:48.102 --> 01:37:49.770
Keep it moving. Well done.

01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:52.507
One set of keys each. Go.

01:37:53.275 --> 01:37:54.209
Good.

01:37:54.409 --> 01:37:57.210
Go. Go.

01:37:57.212 --> 01:37:58.547
And one!

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:00.145
Left block.

01:38:00.147 --> 01:38:01.583
And two!

01:38:01.982 --> 01:38:03.116
Upper block.

01:38:03.118 --> 01:38:04.453
And three!

01:38:04.852 --> 01:38:06.051
Right block.

01:38:06.053 --> 01:38:07.286
And four!

01:38:07.288 --> 01:38:08.688
Legs wide.

01:38:08.690 --> 01:38:09.889
And five!

01:38:09.891 --> 01:38:11.460
Use the weight
of the sword.

01:38:13.026 --> 01:38:15.830
You must lure her.
Trap her.

01:38:16.131 --> 01:38:18.232
Give me time to open a portal.

01:38:18.867 --> 01:38:20.168
Create a vortex.

01:38:20.735 --> 01:38:24.705
Then you must destroy her
so that she can never return.

01:38:26.173 --> 01:38:28.077
It won't be easy, Alex.

01:38:28.810 --> 01:38:30.145
We can do it, Merlin.

01:38:30.912 --> 01:38:32.381
We don't have any choice.

01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:34.415
We have to do it.

01:40:04.472 --> 01:40:06.507
All battalions, stand by.

01:40:06.740 --> 01:40:08.707
This is it. Good luck.

01:40:08.709 --> 01:40:10.876
- Prepare for battle!
- Prepare for battle!

01:40:23.324 --> 01:40:25.057
They're through the gates.

01:40:25.059 --> 01:40:27.195
Wait for it. Wait for it.

01:40:27.930 --> 01:40:29.497
Now! Go! Go! Go!

01:40:29.864 --> 01:40:30.830
Go! Go!

01:40:43.444 --> 01:40:45.577
Reverse! Reset!
Reposition!

01:40:45.579 --> 01:40:47.716
I've never driven
backwards before!

01:40:50.217 --> 01:40:51.283
No!

01:40:51.285 --> 01:40:52.654
Damn!

01:40:55.390 --> 01:40:58.427
Warn Bedders' battalion!
They're coming through!

01:41:08.936 --> 01:41:11.506
- Pull! Pull!
- Pull!

01:41:14.775 --> 01:41:16.642
Pull!

01:41:16.644 --> 01:41:18.143
Charge!

01:41:36.431 --> 01:41:38.967
Drop the horses! One!

01:41:41.503 --> 01:41:42.437
Two!

01:41:43.605 --> 01:41:44.573
Three!

01:41:46.708 --> 01:41:47.776
Four!

01:41:50.512 --> 01:41:51.777
Charge!

01:42:31.186 --> 01:42:33.051
We need more men!

01:42:52.406 --> 01:42:53.872
Get back!

01:42:53.874 --> 01:42:56.408
- Hold the line!
- Retreat!

01:42:56.410 --> 01:42:58.643
Sir Lance and Lady Kaye
are overwhelmed!

01:42:58.645 --> 01:43:01.613
Sir Beddersvere fights
man-to-man!

01:43:03.717 --> 01:43:06.118
Sound the retreat! Fall back!

01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:07.420
Meet on the roof!

01:43:07.422 --> 01:43:09.220
There's too many of them.

01:43:12.092 --> 01:43:14.993
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Retreat now! Now!

01:43:21.802 --> 01:43:22.803
Move!

01:43:23.171 --> 01:43:24.373
Quicker!

01:43:24.838 --> 01:43:25.841
Come on!

01:43:30.177 --> 01:43:32.310
- Barricade!
- Barricade!

01:43:32.312 --> 01:43:34.712
- Barricade!
- Barricade!

01:43:34.714 --> 01:43:36.849
- Barricade!
- Barricade!

01:43:36.851 --> 01:43:38.854
- Build the barricade!
- Quickly!

01:43:41.256 --> 01:43:42.156
Quickly!

01:43:42.356 --> 01:43:43.822
My battalion,
to the far corner.

01:43:43.824 --> 01:43:46.425
- Come on. Take cover.
- Come on. Take cover.

01:43:48.428 --> 01:43:51.565
Keep moving!
Good work! Go!

01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:54.700
- Quickly.
- Over there! Run!

01:43:54.702 --> 01:43:56.471
Good work! Go!

01:44:00.842 --> 01:44:02.273
There's thousands
of them.

01:44:02.275 --> 01:44:03.710
Where's Morgana?

01:44:03.712 --> 01:44:05.478
<i>The barricade
won't hold for long.</i>

01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:08.014
Maybe she's not coming.
Maybe it's over.

01:44:09.818 --> 01:44:10.851
Where's Merlin?

01:44:14.422 --> 01:44:16.458
Hello, Merlin.

01:44:19.561 --> 01:44:21.763
You've hardly aged a day.

01:44:28.436 --> 01:44:30.605
An army of children.

01:44:31.638 --> 01:44:33.740
Did you think I might
take pity on them?

01:44:34.408 --> 01:44:39.580
After all these years,
this is your plan?

01:44:45.186 --> 01:44:46.921
There you are.

01:44:47.122 --> 01:44:49.089
You have no pity.

01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:52.390
These children have
more goodness and nobility

01:44:52.392 --> 01:44:54.462
than you can ever comprehend.

01:44:54.895 --> 01:44:56.196
But, Merlin,

01:44:56.730 --> 01:45:01.168
I have seen them
in their heated hovels,

01:45:01.836 --> 01:45:04.972
with their toys
and trivialities,

01:45:05.673 --> 01:45:08.208
with their ignorance
of nature,

01:45:08.441 --> 01:45:10.177
of magic.

01:45:10.712 --> 01:45:14.549
Do you think these little rats
are worthy of this land?

01:45:14.815 --> 01:45:18.651
Of that sword?
Of my inheritance?

01:45:18.653 --> 01:45:20.088
- Merlin.
- Merlin!

01:45:21.422 --> 01:45:22.591
Yes, I do.

01:45:23.525 --> 01:45:26.661
You and I are history,
Morgana.

01:45:26.994 --> 01:45:30.198
The future is theirs,
not ours.

01:45:31.865 --> 01:45:35.067
They have no future.

01:45:48.415 --> 01:45:49.848
Let's go!
Ready your ropes!

01:45:57.124 --> 01:45:59.694
Alex, don't die.

01:46:00.095 --> 01:46:01.260
I'll do my best.

01:46:07.769 --> 01:46:09.971
Hey, come and get it!

01:46:11.204 --> 01:46:13.574
Over here! Come and get it!

01:46:16.177 --> 01:46:17.712
Bedders! Now!

01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:47.572
Help me!

01:46:47.574 --> 01:46:48.573
Go!

01:46:51.779 --> 01:46:53.949
Pull it!

01:46:54.981 --> 01:46:57.250
Pull! Pull!

01:47:01.623 --> 01:47:02.824
Take cover!

01:47:05.126 --> 01:47:07.227
Come on!

01:47:09.963 --> 01:47:10.966
Hey!

01:47:19.473 --> 01:47:20.374
Hey!

01:47:27.382 --> 01:47:28.383
Hey!

01:47:32.653 --> 01:47:34.387
Lance, Kaye, now!

01:47:34.821 --> 01:47:37.324
Choke her.
Stop her breathing fire!

01:47:39.827 --> 01:47:41.997
- Ready?
- Do it!

01:47:57.610 --> 01:47:59.310
Grab the rope!
Back me up!

01:47:59.312 --> 01:48:00.912
Hurry! Come on!

01:48:00.914 --> 01:48:04.685
Pull! Harder! Pull!

01:48:07.922 --> 01:48:11.226
Don't let go!

01:48:15.596 --> 01:48:18.531
Merlin, we've got her!
We're ready!

01:48:21.267 --> 01:48:22.404
Merlin!

01:48:27.475 --> 01:48:29.744
Someone throw me a jacket!

01:48:30.244 --> 01:48:31.680
Get him a jacket!

01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:39.020
Merlin, speak to me!
Are you okay?

01:48:42.323 --> 01:48:43.388
I'm sorry.

01:48:44.825 --> 01:48:46.358
I've nothing left.

01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:48.695
I've failed you.

01:48:48.995 --> 01:48:51.266
No, not yet, you haven't.

01:48:52.199 --> 01:48:53.934
Magic potion. Quickly.

01:48:56.369 --> 01:48:59.471
Ice cream, cherryade
and chicken nuggets...

01:48:59.473 --> 01:49:00.572
liquidized.

01:49:10.851 --> 01:49:13.751
Alex, we can't hold her
for much longer!

01:51:08.235 --> 01:51:10.100
So great!
You were so good.

01:51:10.102 --> 01:51:12.103
Well done! Well done!

01:51:12.105 --> 01:51:14.740
Congratulations,
we did it. You did it.

01:51:14.742 --> 01:51:18.344
Well fought. We did it.
Well done!

01:51:18.346 --> 01:51:19.911
- Bravo! Congratulations.
- Yes!

01:51:19.913 --> 01:51:22.246
Heroes! Heroes all!

01:51:22.248 --> 01:51:24.716
- Yes, yes! Heroes!
- Woo!

01:51:24.718 --> 01:51:28.152
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:51:28.154 --> 01:51:30.290
Well done! Well fought!

01:51:31.257 --> 01:51:32.392
Well fought!

01:51:38.266 --> 01:51:41.302
I've seen
many great battles in my time.

01:51:42.035 --> 01:51:44.437
The siege of Guinnion Fort,

01:51:44.704 --> 01:51:47.341
the Saxons halted
on Badon Hill.

01:51:47.941 --> 01:51:51.343
But believe me,
none were fought as bravely

01:51:51.345 --> 01:51:55.346
as yours against Morgana
and the Mortes Milles.

01:51:55.348 --> 01:51:59.087
You have truly surpassed
my every expectation.

01:51:59.486 --> 01:52:01.254
Merlin, we won the battle,

01:52:01.989 --> 01:52:04.322
but Britain's still the same
place it was before.

01:52:04.324 --> 01:52:07.091
Yeah, how can we ever
change anything else?

01:52:07.093 --> 01:52:10.828
And, even with the sword,
who's ever gonna listen to us?

01:52:10.830 --> 01:52:13.130
It's true. We're just kids.

01:52:13.132 --> 01:52:15.936
That may be so.
Yet know this.

01:52:16.637 --> 01:52:20.140
There is a wise, old soul
within every child.

01:52:24.378 --> 01:52:27.247
And a foolish child
in every old soul.

01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:31.051
Perhaps you have
more battles yet to fight.

01:52:31.418 --> 01:52:35.353
They may not be against demons
or undead knights,

01:52:35.355 --> 01:52:37.724
or won with swords or armies.

01:52:38.258 --> 01:52:41.462
But even if you do not
wield Excalibur,

01:52:42.495 --> 01:52:45.266
you will still know
what it stands for...

01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:48.236
what you stand for.

01:52:49.637 --> 01:52:50.969
Sir Beddersvere,

01:52:50.971 --> 01:52:53.906
I gave you the power
of metal duplication.

01:52:53.908 --> 01:52:56.907
I was going to take
it away, but now,

01:52:56.909 --> 01:52:59.345
I believe you can be
trusted with it.

01:52:59.747 --> 01:53:02.182
Really? Seriously?

01:53:04.083 --> 01:53:05.419
Thank you, Merlin!

01:53:06.119 --> 01:53:09.323
I promise I'll never use it
for anything but good.

01:53:11.825 --> 01:53:13.328
Sir Lance, Lady Kaye,

01:53:14.829 --> 01:53:17.098
you are brave,
loyal and noble.

01:53:17.530 --> 01:53:20.165
You have learned
to fight for others,

01:53:20.167 --> 01:53:22.102
not just fight for yourselves.

01:53:23.003 --> 01:53:25.973
You are truly Knights
of the Round Table.

01:53:27.007 --> 01:53:28.209
Thank you, Merlin.

01:53:30.511 --> 01:53:31.412
Thank you, Merlin.

01:53:33.312 --> 01:53:36.715
Alexander, I borrowed
this book of yours,

01:53:36.717 --> 01:53:38.586
made a few alterations.

01:53:58.940 --> 01:54:00.274
Thanks, Merlin.

01:54:02.575 --> 01:54:05.546
A land is only as good
as its leaders.

01:54:06.846 --> 01:54:09.684
And you will make
excellent leaders.

01:54:54.715 --> 01:54:59.715
