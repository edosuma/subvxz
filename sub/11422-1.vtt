01:42.144 --> 01:43.605
Back up! Back up!

02:04.601 --> 02:08.149
Fans, it's the bottom of the ninth.
And the bases are loaded.

02:08.316 --> 02:10.612
And guess who the orphans
have at bat!

02:10.820 --> 02:13.659
That's right.
It's the home-run queen herself.

02:13.825 --> 02:16.915
The Belter from the Shelter. Miss...

02:17.124 --> 02:17.959
Amanda Lemmon!

02:18.334 --> 02:20.337
- What?
- I'm going to kill you!

02:20.505 --> 02:22.925
Didn't I tell you
not to play in that dress?

02:23.302 --> 02:26.307
Come on, Diane!
I ain't going to hurt it.

02:26.474 --> 02:29.897
It's time for your interview.
Drop the bat. Let's go!

02:30.105 --> 02:33.110
Just let me smash
this ball downtown, okay?

02:33.487 --> 02:35.657
All right. You got 10 seconds.

02:35.865 --> 02:40.082
Otherwise, the game is going to be
called on account of bloodshed!

02:40.833 --> 02:43.504
Come on, Frankie.
I got to go to Staten Island.

02:43.838 --> 02:45.884
Staten Island? What about camp?

02:46.050 --> 02:47.261
You'll miss the bus!

02:47.470 --> 02:49.432
I won't. It's just a look-see.

02:49.599 --> 02:52.312
They're trying to place you
with the Butkises?!

02:53.272 --> 02:54.775
So what if they are?

02:54.983 --> 02:58.281
You ever met those people?
That family collects kids.

02:58.490 --> 02:59.742
They'll take anybody.

02:59.951 --> 03:01.745
Even rejects like you.

03:01.870 --> 03:05.002
Shut up, Frankie!
At least I got an interview.

03:06.296 --> 03:08.675
And Amanda Butkis steps to the plate.

04:03.857 --> 04:06.570
- Come on. Hop in.
- It was a grand slam!

04:06.779 --> 04:08.365
See if they want a little boy!

04:08.658 --> 04:10.161
Me and her. Two for one.

04:10.369 --> 04:11.580
What am I, on sale?

04:11.788 --> 04:13.291
Get your own!

04:15.629 --> 04:17.548
Staten Island, please.

04:20.596 --> 04:22.057
You're out. We win!

04:22.307 --> 04:24.603
Amanda didn't touch home plate!

04:25.855 --> 04:28.360
You're a dead man, Frankie!

04:44.097 --> 04:45.014
Okay, so...

04:45.224 --> 04:46.559
...it's not Park Avenue.

04:46.726 --> 04:48.938
You can't judge a book by the cover.

04:49.147 --> 04:51.568
You don't want to
be an orphan forever.

04:51.735 --> 04:55.158
- So adopt me, why don't you?
- They won't let me, on my salary.

04:55.366 --> 04:58.497
Besides that, you deserve
a mother and a father.

04:58.748 --> 05:00.292
So get a husband!

05:00.584 --> 05:02.797
It's not like buying a car, you know!

05:02.963 --> 05:06.095
I know. It's got to be that
"Can't eat, can't sleep...

05:06.261 --> 05:10.686
...reach for the stars.
World Series" kind of stuff, right?

05:10.894 --> 05:12.565
A girl has her standards.

05:13.065 --> 05:16.822
Well, I got mine. And I say.
Let's blow off these people!

05:19.952 --> 05:20.954
Gum.

05:21.580 --> 05:22.415
Hat.

05:24.377 --> 05:25.797
Other gum.

05:29.428 --> 05:32.141
Look. I know these people
have a stupid name...

05:32.809 --> 05:34.646
...but they really like kids.

05:34.813 --> 05:36.649
Okay? So put on a smile.

05:38.820 --> 05:40.406
Sell it, girl!

05:40.615 --> 05:43.328
Why do I always got to wear a dress?

05:44.747 --> 05:46.876
Because it makes you
look so pretty.

05:55.224 --> 05:58.731
Oh, isn't she the most precious thing?

05:59.314 --> 06:01.319
What a pretty little dress!

06:01.569 --> 06:04.825
She's a honey! Look.
She's got your mother's smile.

06:07.580 --> 06:10.085
And your father's sense of humor.

06:12.380 --> 06:13.883
That's very funny!

06:14.050 --> 06:15.261
Come on in!

06:15.386 --> 06:16.888
Come in, sweetie!

06:18.891 --> 06:22.523
Why, you'll love it in here!
It's going to be fabulous.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.164
Callaway, huh?

06:54.831 --> 06:56.459
Must be a real big shot.

06:56.668 --> 06:59.047
You'd be surprised how big.

07:04.808 --> 07:06.186
All this for her?

07:17.915 --> 07:19.793
Welcome home, princess.

07:21.170 --> 07:23.091
He forgot again, didn't he?

07:23.300 --> 07:27.015
I'm afraid your father's
been unavoidably detained.

07:27.182 --> 07:28.559
If it's any consolation...

07:28.684 --> 07:31.940
...I know an old butler
who's mighty glad to see you.

07:32.566 --> 07:34.820
I'm sorry, Vincenzo.

07:34.987 --> 07:37.200
How terribly rude of me!

07:37.367 --> 07:39.495
I'm very glad to see you too.

07:39.996 --> 07:41.290
Thank you, honey.

07:42.083 --> 07:44.504
I see you've been practicing.
Congratulations!

07:44.629 --> 07:46.048
What's his excuse?

07:46.173 --> 07:48.428
Your father? Well...

07:48.678 --> 07:51.976
...he's preparing for your arrival
up at the summer house.

07:52.143 --> 07:54.063
- Which one?
- Lake Minocqua.

07:54.689 --> 07:57.736
But that's been closed for years.
He never goes there.

07:58.279 --> 07:59.865
He does now.

08:00.074 --> 08:02.870
Vincenzo, you big fat fibber!
What's going on?

08:03.747 --> 08:05.876
My lips are sealed.

08:06.210 --> 08:08.338
You mean it's a surprise?

08:08.923 --> 08:10.968
You could put it that way.

08:11.219 --> 08:13.097
It's a welcome home party for me!

08:13.264 --> 08:15.769
I knew Daddy was up to something.

08:15.977 --> 08:18.065
Alyssa, I didn't say...

08:18.357 --> 08:19.234
I won't tell.

08:19.484 --> 08:22.824
I've never had a surprise party
in my whole life!

08:25.662 --> 08:28.417
Well, this'll certainly
be a surprise.

08:31.005 --> 08:33.008
Come on, move it!

08:34.845 --> 08:37.767
- I got 43.
- Me too. Guess who's missing?

08:38.434 --> 08:39.938
Carmen, where's Amanda?

08:40.104 --> 08:41.607
She's not coming.

08:46.115 --> 08:48.619
Hey, slugger. What's up?

08:49.121 --> 08:51.625
I'm not going to stupid camp.

08:53.295 --> 08:56.676
I don't blame you.
Look at this place. It's a pigsty!

08:56.843 --> 08:59.180
It'll take you a week
to make your bed.

08:59.389 --> 09:01.476
Don't joke. I'm serious.

09:01.684 --> 09:03.103
I'm not joking.

09:03.855 --> 09:06.735
That's why I sent
the bus ahead without us.

09:06.860 --> 09:08.029
Liar.

09:08.196 --> 09:11.035
- How much you want to bet?
- Fifty bucks.

09:11.286 --> 09:14.332
- Okay. So I didn't send the bus.
- Cough it up.

09:14.583 --> 09:15.918
But I will.

09:16.587 --> 09:20.344
Then we can sit here until
you tell me what's really wrong.

09:21.053 --> 09:24.476
I'm not going
to stupid Butkis' either.

09:25.353 --> 09:27.272
I was waiting for that one.

09:28.692 --> 09:33.450
If they're the best I can do.
Frankie's right. I am a reject.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.958
You're not a reject.

09:38.208 --> 09:41.048
It's just that most people
want to adopt...

09:41.256 --> 09:42.550
Babies.

09:42.926 --> 09:44.136
I know.

09:44.720 --> 09:47.976
This orphan stuff is
like growing up in a dog pound.

09:48.102 --> 09:49.771
Everybody wants a puppy.

09:49.938 --> 09:52.861
Just once. I'd like to sleep
in my own room.

09:54.113 --> 09:56.826
Hey, come here a minute.
Listen to me.

09:56.993 --> 09:58.787
You listening to me?

10:00.206 --> 10:04.965
I'm going to find you the best home
in the entire world.

10:05.717 --> 10:06.802
That's a promise.

10:07.970 --> 10:11.060
You don't make promises, remember?

10:11.769 --> 10:16.528
I didn't say I don't make promises.
I don't make promises I can't keep.

10:16.653 --> 10:18.322
There's a big difference.

10:21.244 --> 10:24.125
Now can we please go to camp?

10:24.667 --> 10:26.337
Please?

10:31.513 --> 10:33.100
But you still owe me $50.

11:28.574 --> 11:31.955
Oh, Vincenzo, it's gorgeous!

11:32.247 --> 11:34.961
I think this house is going
to be my favorite.

11:36.255 --> 11:38.843
I remember many happy years here.

11:39.761 --> 11:40.972
- There she is.
- Daddy!

11:41.139 --> 11:44.185
Come over here, my little...

11:44.770 --> 11:46.063
Wait a minute!

11:46.273 --> 11:50.530
You're not Alyssa. She's little.
You're a foot taller than her.

11:50.697 --> 11:51.908
It's me. Honest!

11:52.075 --> 11:53.369
It is?

11:55.498 --> 11:58.378
I've missed you.
I'm sorry I wasn't at the airport.

11:58.503 --> 12:02.427
That's okay. I knew it had
to be something really important.

12:02.635 --> 12:04.848
Like a party, maybe?

12:06.350 --> 12:07.185
She knows?

12:07.853 --> 12:09.022
I didn't say a thing!

12:09.899 --> 12:13.321
Vincenzo didn't tell me.
I figured it out on my own.

12:13.822 --> 12:16.911
I should have let you surprise me.
But I'm too excited.

12:17.663 --> 12:18.622
You are?

12:18.957 --> 12:20.709
It's still on, isn't it?

12:21.001 --> 12:23.506
Of course it's still on, sweetheart.

12:23.756 --> 12:26.177
But are we talking
about the same party?

12:27.388 --> 12:29.934
Roger, she's darling!

12:30.143 --> 12:33.691
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
Clarice Kensington.

12:34.067 --> 12:36.446
Hello, Miss Kensington.
How do you do?

12:38.032 --> 12:41.205
What a perfect little girl!

12:41.539 --> 12:44.419
Roger, I'm absolutely smitten!

12:46.381 --> 12:48.844
You and I are going
to be great friends.

12:49.052 --> 12:50.513
Are you here for my party?

12:51.515 --> 12:53.143
Your party?

12:54.520 --> 12:57.692
Roger, don't tell me
you haven't told her?

12:57.985 --> 12:59.238
Told me what?

13:01.700 --> 13:04.497
Sweetheart, the party is not for...

13:04.664 --> 13:07.794
Another couple of hours.

13:07.919 --> 13:10.299
Let's get you settled in, princess.

13:10.507 --> 13:12.344
Yes, why don't you do that?

13:12.511 --> 13:16.226
I'm sure you two have lots
to talk about.

13:17.729 --> 13:20.651
He didn't tell her.
I can't believe he didn't tell her.

13:20.817 --> 13:23.155
Maybe he wanted
to tell her in person.

13:24.616 --> 13:27.454
I'm sorry.
Did I say something to you?

13:47.991 --> 13:51.498
Remember to bring your own bag.
Everybody off!

14:02.351 --> 14:04.605
Yo, Carmen, you blind?

14:04.772 --> 14:05.941
What?

14:10.657 --> 14:13.036
Girl, when you going
to get a life?

14:19.048 --> 14:23.013
Miss Kensington seems nice.
Does she work with you?

14:26.018 --> 14:27.437
Not exactly.

14:30.568 --> 14:32.238
I got something to show you.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.074
Right up here.

14:35.118 --> 14:37.038
You see there? Across the lake?

14:37.456 --> 14:40.627
That's Camp Callaway.
That was your mom's favorite project.

14:41.504 --> 14:43.215
So is she from the camp?

14:43.508 --> 14:44.551
Who?

14:44.886 --> 14:46.555
Miss Kensington.

14:47.766 --> 14:49.227
Sweetheart...

14:49.602 --> 14:51.940
...I want to have a talk with you.

14:56.197 --> 14:57.533
You know, Alyssa...

14:57.951 --> 14:59.871
...a lot's happened
while you were gone.

15:01.750 --> 15:05.673
I haven't been able to come up
to this house since Mom passed away.

15:06.926 --> 15:10.306
But there comes a time
when a person has to move on.

15:11.183 --> 15:12.978
You're getting older.

15:13.938 --> 15:16.401
There's just so much
a father can do without help.

15:16.734 --> 15:19.614
- We have Vincenzo. He helps us.
- Yes, he does.

15:19.907 --> 15:23.246
He's been a good friend
to this family for a long time.

15:24.248 --> 15:27.170
But what I think
our family needs is a...

15:28.047 --> 15:30.551
Excuse me.
Telephone. Board meeting.

15:30.718 --> 15:33.139
- Let me call them back, okay?
- It's urgent.

15:33.431 --> 15:34.517
I'm with my...

15:38.649 --> 15:39.526
Forgive me?

15:39.818 --> 15:41.112
Don't I always?

15:43.825 --> 15:45.745
So good to have you home.

15:48.667 --> 15:49.961
On two?

15:52.048 --> 15:53.718
Hey, young lady!

15:53.969 --> 15:56.932
Summer vacation. Official.
Go play!

15:57.349 --> 15:58.810
Will you come with me?

15:59.019 --> 16:03.027
I wish I could, but I got
a lot of work to do. Sorry.

16:18.555 --> 16:21.016
Check it out!
Buckingham Palace.

16:21.184 --> 16:24.940
That's in London, brainless.
It's the Callaway house.

16:25.275 --> 16:28.405
Nobody's lived there for years.
It's haunted.

16:28.572 --> 16:31.745
- It's not either!
- Ask anyone. Every full moon...

16:31.953 --> 16:35.292
...old lady Callaway's ghost crosses
the lake and eats a camper.

16:35.585 --> 16:39.634
Yeah, right. And Santa Claus lives
with the tooth fairy in Oueens.

16:39.926 --> 16:41.762
- You ever been there?
- No.

16:41.929 --> 16:45.644
If it's not haunted.
Why don't you go ring the doorbell?

16:45.854 --> 16:48.483
- You think I'm scared?
- Five bucks says you're chicken.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.195
Cough it up, choirboy!

16:50.445 --> 16:52.449
Show me your money.

16:52.908 --> 16:54.494
This I got to see!

17:16.157 --> 17:19.664
They say the first Mrs. Callaway
was a lovely woman...

17:19.873 --> 17:23.295
...but look at this room!

17:23.880 --> 17:27.136
No wonder she's dead!
She had absolutely no taste.

17:27.428 --> 17:29.015
I can't wait to sell this house.

17:29.849 --> 17:33.397
I want one bar set up in here
and two out in the patio.

17:38.281 --> 17:40.284
Well, hello, munchkin!

17:50.553 --> 17:52.473
Daddy!

17:53.934 --> 17:55.979
Honey, what's the matter?

17:58.359 --> 18:00.696
- You all right?
- No!

18:01.155 --> 18:01.949
What?

18:02.157 --> 18:03.451
What happened?

18:03.910 --> 18:05.831
She hates this house!

18:06.164 --> 18:10.881
Let's not be dramatic, darling.
She was hiding in the den.

18:11.215 --> 18:15.306
I simply said that
we might fix it up someday.

18:15.974 --> 18:17.685
That is, if you'll let me.

18:19.188 --> 18:20.690
Who is she?

18:27.954 --> 18:29.998
There's no easy way to say this.

18:35.258 --> 18:36.636
Sweetheart...

18:37.095 --> 18:40.434
...Clarice and I
will be married next month.

18:41.811 --> 18:45.903
You'll finally have a real family.
She's going to be your new mother.

18:46.111 --> 18:47.155
Isn't that wonderful?

18:57.381 --> 18:59.510
She does this sometimes.

19:00.804 --> 19:03.351
- Honey.
- And she gets away with it.

19:03.851 --> 19:07.775
I'm sorry. Roger, but little tantrums
mustn't be rewarded.

19:09.529 --> 19:11.031
Come on, sweetheart.

19:11.240 --> 19:12.534
You're making it worse.

19:12.951 --> 19:15.372
I know what I'm talking about.

19:17.084 --> 19:18.252
All right, people!

19:18.462 --> 19:19.756
Back to work, Shoo!

19:21.008 --> 19:23.261
Let's focus on the engagement party.

19:23.971 --> 19:25.515
Sure hope you're right.

19:28.270 --> 19:30.983
Trust me, I'm a woman.

19:33.571 --> 19:37.495
Look at the time!
I've got to get my face on.

19:42.087 --> 19:44.717
How's about some milk and cookies?

19:45.969 --> 19:48.724
I've lost my mother.
Now I've lost my father.

19:48.974 --> 19:50.393
I have no family!

19:50.560 --> 19:52.981
I'm an orphan, and I'm running away!

19:53.190 --> 19:55.778
And don't you dare tell Daddy!

19:57.030 --> 19:59.285
- We got to hide!
- What if we get caught?

19:59.535 --> 20:01.037
- Don't let her see us!
- Who?

20:01.246 --> 20:02.123
Old lady Callaway!

20:02.623 --> 20:04.252
There's no ghost.

20:05.296 --> 20:06.130
Look at her!

20:07.799 --> 20:09.428
She's nuts!

20:15.105 --> 20:16.732
I won't go back.

20:17.025 --> 20:18.361
I won't!

20:18.570 --> 20:20.489
She's not the boss of me.

20:21.074 --> 20:22.744
Have you seen Alyssa?

20:22.952 --> 20:26.250
I'm under strict orders
not to tell you that she ran away.

20:27.461 --> 20:28.712
Why didn't you stop her?

20:28.963 --> 20:33.763
I thought I'd give her a head start
so she could reclaim a little dignity.

20:34.348 --> 20:36.727
You'll make sure she comes home okay?

20:36.894 --> 20:38.689
Don't worry. Right away, boss.

20:39.022 --> 20:40.484
Thanks, Vin.

20:42.946 --> 20:45.034
It doesn't look haunted.

20:45.284 --> 20:47.538
That's what they want you to think.

20:47.622 --> 20:50.001
This isn't funny.
Let's get out of here!

20:50.168 --> 20:51.879
Don't worry!
She'll chicken out.

21:14.169 --> 21:15.254
Well...

21:15.421 --> 21:18.386
...if it isn't
the little orphan girl.

21:19.095 --> 21:20.097
Someone's home!

21:20.430 --> 21:22.643
We were just coming after you.

21:23.394 --> 21:26.066
I didn't mean nothing!
It was just a joke.

21:26.233 --> 21:28.069
I was just kidding around!

21:30.824 --> 21:32.745
She didn't even scream.

21:33.120 --> 21:35.374
Let's get you ready
for the big dinner.

21:35.625 --> 21:36.459
Big dinner?

21:36.627 --> 21:39.465
Listen, Lurch, you don't want me.
I'm too skinny!

21:39.840 --> 21:40.884
There are other kids.

21:41.093 --> 21:44.014
Big, fat ones, right outside.
Eat them!

21:46.144 --> 21:48.188
What in the world
are you talking about?

21:54.826 --> 21:57.915
The full moon.
That's tonight, right?

22:00.920 --> 22:03.299
Old lady Callaway's ghost!

22:06.723 --> 22:08.392
It's her!

22:15.404 --> 22:16.908
I guess you think I'm stupid.

22:17.158 --> 22:20.205
No, you're just a little upset.
That's all.

22:20.413 --> 22:22.668
Looks like I just won five bucks.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.923
So when's this party?
Am I invited?

22:26.341 --> 22:27.927
Your dress is upstairs.

22:28.136 --> 22:29.430
Cocktails are at five.

22:29.638 --> 22:31.726
Now if you'll excuse me, please.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.604
A dress?

22:33.855 --> 22:34.981
Me?

22:35.191 --> 22:37.360
You got to be kidding!

22:42.495 --> 22:44.832
Nobody's even looking for me.

22:46.585 --> 22:48.506
There you are!

22:49.758 --> 22:52.388
I have been looking
everywhere for you!

22:52.555 --> 22:53.807
You have?

22:54.016 --> 22:55.810
Of course I have.

22:56.395 --> 22:58.064
Let me ask you a question.

22:58.565 --> 23:01.237
You did not come
all the way up here...

23:01.696 --> 23:04.409
...to sit around
like a bump on a log, did you?

23:05.077 --> 23:06.287
No.

23:07.581 --> 23:09.210
I guess not.

23:09.711 --> 23:12.132
Come on, slugger.
The_re playing football.

23:12.299 --> 23:14.761
You're missing out on all the fun.

23:28.745 --> 23:31.834
I thought, "Where is she?
What's happened to her?"

23:36.593 --> 23:40.558
- I hear Amanda's quite the jock.
- The kid's a natural. Great speed.

23:40.767 --> 23:44.523
Student body, left. Everybody block
for Amanda. On four. Ready?

23:44.815 --> 23:45.943
W

23:46.485 --> 23:47.695
Who's Amanda?

23:47.904 --> 23:49.114
Funny.

24:42.836 --> 24:45.800
She's probably
eating her liver right now.

24:46.134 --> 24:50.683
You think one camper's enough?
I mean, what if she's still hungry?

24:51.060 --> 24:52.270
Look!

24:56.569 --> 24:58.072
Hey, I got it!

24:58.281 --> 24:59.783
Run!

25:00.869 --> 25:03.081
You're going the wrong way!

25:12.097 --> 25:13.517
Great speed.

25:13.683 --> 25:15.813
Bad sense of direction.

26:01.728 --> 26:04.483
Do you see what I see?

26:04.650 --> 26:07.823
I don't know what you see.
But what I see is me.

26:08.490 --> 26:09.909
I see me, too.

26:11.162 --> 26:13.416
Does that mean there's two of you?

26:13.583 --> 26:15.420
Or two of me?

26:31.449 --> 26:33.285
There really is two of us!

26:33.745 --> 26:35.539
Don't you find this odd?

26:35.956 --> 26:39.963
No, this is weird.
This is really, really weird.

26:41.174 --> 26:42.551
Wait a sec!

26:43.011 --> 26:44.806
You live at the Callaway house!

26:44.931 --> 26:47.185
You're that girl from camp!

26:47.602 --> 26:49.898
They thought I was you!

26:50.107 --> 26:52.820
Alyssa Callaway.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

26:52.987 --> 26:54.782
Amanda, Put her there!

26:55.491 --> 26:57.704
No wonder that penguin guy
asked me in!

26:58.456 --> 27:00.959
That's Vincenzo. He's our butler.

27:01.169 --> 27:02.922
Who's the woman with the long hair?

27:03.214 --> 27:04.716
I liked her.

27:04.925 --> 27:08.432
That's Diane. We're buds.
She's pretty cool for a grownup.

27:10.394 --> 27:12.439
What were you doing over there?

27:13.190 --> 27:16.529
I wanted to see what
it was like to be an orphan.

27:16.947 --> 27:17.907
What?

27:18.325 --> 27:20.621
- Why?
- Because it looked like fun.

27:21.163 --> 27:25.170
Fun? Being an orphan?
What's the matter with you?

27:25.671 --> 27:27.466
So why were you at my house?

27:28.593 --> 27:30.888
I was just...

27:31.640 --> 27:33.351
I was just ringing the doorbell.

27:33.853 --> 27:34.938
What for?

27:35.355 --> 27:37.651
Because kids think
that place is haunted.

27:38.152 --> 27:39.571
That's stupid.

27:40.239 --> 27:43.078
Well, then who's
that scary blond lady?

27:44.037 --> 27:45.874
She's absolutely horrid!

27:46.041 --> 27:49.464
- If I were you, I'd get rid of her.
- Any suggestions?

27:49.673 --> 27:51.467
You're talking to a pro here!

27:51.676 --> 27:55.224
I've driven away more possible parents
than you'll ever meet.

27:55.600 --> 27:56.977
Don't you want a family?

27:57.395 --> 27:59.691
A girl's got to have her standards.

28:00.942 --> 28:04.074
So tell me, this party.
You really don't want to go?

28:04.658 --> 28:06.286
I'd rather eat dirt.

28:06.453 --> 28:07.454
Okay, listen.

28:07.622 --> 28:10.419
You be me, I'll be you.
One night only.

28:10.627 --> 28:13.340
Tomorrow at noon, we switch back.
What do you say?

28:13.716 --> 28:17.639
That's wonderful! That way.
You can scare off Clarice for me.

28:17.764 --> 28:21.521
Don't be such a goody-goody.
I got a reputation to protect.

28:21.813 --> 28:24.318
I scored a touchdown, didn't I?

28:24.611 --> 28:26.530
Okay, just don't talk so good.

28:26.739 --> 28:29.118
Use lousy English like:

28:29.285 --> 28:33.000
Ain't ya never gonna wanna
doncha hafta go to the bathroom?

28:33.209 --> 28:34.211
That sort of thing.

28:35.005 --> 28:38.218
You ain't got nothing to worry about.

28:38.510 --> 28:41.850
I say, you do catch on rather quickly.

28:43.144 --> 28:45.272
Stables, noon.

29:14.325 --> 29:17.872
Miss Kensington says
fashionably late was an hour ago.

29:18.040 --> 29:19.585
What's the problem?

29:19.793 --> 29:21.296
I'm a hairdresser...

29:21.504 --> 29:23.508
...not a zookeeper.

29:31.105 --> 29:34.069
What in the name of God
is going on here?

29:36.281 --> 29:39.578
Hi, Vinnie. I mean, Vincenzo.

29:39.745 --> 29:40.914
I got...

29:41.081 --> 29:42.458
...distracted.

29:43.043 --> 29:44.838
You don't have to apologize.

29:45.298 --> 29:46.507
Really?

29:46.759 --> 29:48.219
Cool!

29:48.720 --> 29:52.393
I mean, it's just that
I'm so terribly relieved that you...

29:52.560 --> 29:54.481
...aren't pissed.

29:58.070 --> 29:58.989
"Pissed, " miss?

30:02.620 --> 30:07.546
Why don't you get dressed, please?
And let Carlo do your hair.

30:08.464 --> 30:10.676
I liked it better when she fainted.

30:44.863 --> 30:46.783
This is really good!

30:47.409 --> 30:50.623
Of course it is, silly.
It's your favorite.

30:50.790 --> 30:52.043
It is?

30:53.002 --> 30:54.422
Yes, of course.

30:57.886 --> 31:00.349
The big, gooey, messy burger.

31:00.683 --> 31:02.687
Also known as a sloppy joe.

31:03.062 --> 31:05.066
Sloppy joe, Right.

31:06.193 --> 31:07.946
Your favorite?

31:08.321 --> 31:10.034
And with dern good reason!

31:12.037 --> 31:13.664
Did you just say "dern"?

31:28.316 --> 31:30.027
Good evening.

31:30.236 --> 31:32.114
How swell of you to come!

31:32.324 --> 31:34.285
So nice to see you.

31:34.493 --> 31:35.996
Like my dress?

31:36.956 --> 31:39.002
Escargot, Miss Callaway?

31:39.461 --> 31:41.632
Why, thank you, waiter person.

31:42.007 --> 31:43.385
I'm starving.

31:43.593 --> 31:46.516
I mean, I'd adore one!

31:50.606 --> 31:52.651
This tastes like a balloon.

31:52.901 --> 31:54.363
It's snails, miss.

31:55.699 --> 31:57.118
Good.

31:57.994 --> 31:59.330
Nice.

31:59.915 --> 32:01.250
Chewy.

32:07.177 --> 32:10.350
All this money
and these people eat slugs!

32:13.857 --> 32:17.738
Look who's finally decided
to grace us with her presence!

32:17.989 --> 32:21.369
Clarice, right?
You looked better with the mask.

32:22.038 --> 32:23.457
I beg your pardon?

32:25.502 --> 32:29.718
Clarice has been regaling us with
your accomplishments at the academy.

32:30.010 --> 32:34.059
- Might we entice you to play something?
- Of course.

32:34.226 --> 32:38.483
I'd be delighted!
Whatever did you have in mind?

32:38.735 --> 32:39.569
Checkers?

32:39.861 --> 32:41.531
Dodge ball?

32:45.455 --> 32:47.541
No, dear girl.

32:47.876 --> 32:51.298
Muffy was referring to the piano.

32:53.136 --> 32:56.934
Ladies and gentlemen.
May I have your attention, please?

32:57.101 --> 33:01.108
Before we sit down to dinner.
My future stepdaughter...

33:01.317 --> 33:03.946
...whom I absolutely adore...

33:04.072 --> 33:06.743
...has consented to play
one of the pieces...

33:06.910 --> 33:10.416
...that won her first prize
at the Windsor Academy youth recital.

33:16.803 --> 33:19.349
Hold it! Time-out.
I can't play the piano.

33:19.975 --> 33:21.394
I just told them you would.

33:21.729 --> 33:24.024
Then do me a grand favor
and untell them!

33:27.155 --> 33:30.661
If you embarrass me
in front of all these people...

33:30.870 --> 33:34.376
...I'll make sure that
you never play anything...

33:34.626 --> 33:37.465
...ever again.
Have I made myself clear?

33:38.593 --> 33:40.470
Clear as glass.

33:40.929 --> 33:44.269
In fact, I can see right through you.

33:56.124 --> 33:57.751
Ladies and gentlemen.

33:57.960 --> 34:01.091
Normally, I'd be tickled
to play a selection...

34:01.300 --> 34:02.552
...from...

34:03.178 --> 34:04.013
...Chopin.

34:04.180 --> 34:06.851
But in honor of my new stepmother...

34:07.018 --> 34:10.399
...whom I absolutely adore...

34:11.318 --> 34:15.032
...I decided to play
a little something of my own.

34:40.661 --> 34:43.625
Do you think my daughter's
asking for attention?

34:43.835 --> 34:46.045
I'd say she's demanding it.

34:51.806 --> 34:53.101
Finn!

34:53.393 --> 34:54.728
Huckleberry Finn!

34:54.938 --> 34:56.148
You got it!

35:03.996 --> 35:06.625
The guys are ahead of us
by eight seconds.

35:06.959 --> 35:10.132
- Amanda, it's your turn. Go, girl!
- Me?

35:10.299 --> 35:13.137
You're the best.
Show them what you got.

35:28.415 --> 35:30.126
Look at her. She's nervous!

35:30.334 --> 35:31.337
Yeah, so?

35:31.503 --> 35:34.008
The old Amanda wasn't
scared of nothing.

35:38.850 --> 35:40.895
What am I supposed to do?

35:43.566 --> 35:44.944
Ready.

35:45.362 --> 35:46.573
Set.

35:46.906 --> 35:47.908
Go!

35:50.120 --> 35:51.372
Song!

36:04.312 --> 36:05.273
What happened?

36:05.773 --> 36:07.569
"London Bridge is Falling Down"!

36:08.278 --> 36:09.238
That's it!

36:29.817 --> 36:31.570
You may enter.

36:33.323 --> 36:34.408
Mind if we talk?

36:34.909 --> 36:36.621
Whatever about?

36:38.040 --> 36:38.958
Clarice.

36:41.505 --> 36:42.340
None of that.

36:42.715 --> 36:47.348
She was upset with your performance.
Shouldn't you give her a chance?

36:47.641 --> 36:51.606
I did, and she's a big phoney-baloney.
If you ask me.

36:52.274 --> 36:55.864
I've never heard you this outspoken.
It'd be nice to have a mother.

36:56.448 --> 37:01.290
Yeah, and it'd be nice
to have a father too. I mean...

37:01.457 --> 37:05.339
No, no. Sweetheart. I think the
person you're really angry at...

37:05.506 --> 37:06.341
...is me.

37:06.883 --> 37:07.927
You?

37:08.135 --> 37:09.764
What'd you do?

37:11.600 --> 37:15.107
I haven't been much of a father lately.
I haven't seen you.

37:15.357 --> 37:18.779
But all that's going to change.
Clarice is going back to the city.

37:19.156 --> 37:22.119
Gee, I hope it was nothing I did.

37:22.286 --> 37:27.128
No, she's got a wedding to plan, but
we'll get to spend some time together.

37:27.337 --> 37:30.050
Get to know each other again.
Is that okay?

37:32.680 --> 37:35.351
Let's tuck you in.
You little snuggler.

37:37.814 --> 37:39.317
See you tomorrow.

37:42.030 --> 37:43.407
Good night, honey.

37:45.369 --> 37:47.414
I like having a father.

37:48.834 --> 37:51.714
I like having a daughter.
Good night, sweetie.

37:58.768 --> 38:00.271
Lights out!

38:02.984 --> 38:05.071
Lights out, cabin three!

38:21.225 --> 38:23.938
- Come on, come on.
- This I got to see!

38:24.106 --> 38:26.568
We're going to get caught.
I just know it!

38:28.739 --> 38:30.868
Come on, Frankie. It's a full moon!

38:31.202 --> 38:35.126
Shut up, stupid!
Lombies hear better than dogs.

38:47.732 --> 38:49.526
It's a frog!

38:51.279 --> 38:55.663
Amanda? Scared of a frog?
She's changed, all right!

38:55.830 --> 38:57.249
Now do you believe me?

38:57.457 --> 39:01.882
Yeah, she's one of them pod people.
Let's get out of here!

39:04.429 --> 39:06.140
A frog?

39:06.640 --> 39:08.101
You know what?

39:08.561 --> 39:10.481
You should have kissed it.

39:10.689 --> 39:13.528
He might've turned out
to be Prince Charming.

39:13.904 --> 39:14.906
Grose!

39:15.073 --> 39:16.700
Not for you. For me!

39:16.992 --> 39:18.578
You'd kiss a frog?

39:18.788 --> 39:19.664
No.

39:19.997 --> 39:22.085
Toads are my specialty.

39:22.294 --> 39:25.258
Big, old, ugly suckers
with tongues like this.

39:25.466 --> 39:26.677
- It is not.
- It is too!

39:26.886 --> 39:30.476
- How else am I going to catch a guy?
- I don't know.

39:33.856 --> 39:35.234
There's that smile!

39:35.400 --> 39:39.199
And that time. I think it went
all the way up to your eyes.

39:39.909 --> 39:41.787
You remind me of someone.

39:41.870 --> 39:43.791
I do? Who?

39:44.000 --> 39:45.836
Someone I've never met.

39:46.212 --> 39:48.007
How, if you've never met her?

39:48.424 --> 39:52.097
Sometimes when I dream.
I think I see her.

39:54.310 --> 39:57.942
You know, you've been acting
just a little bit weirder today.

39:58.234 --> 40:00.780
I think maybe it's all this fresh air.

40:01.030 --> 40:02.700
Don't make fun.

40:03.785 --> 40:05.037
Sorry.

40:05.413 --> 40:08.001
Usually you're such a tough guy.

40:08.209 --> 40:09.921
Don't tell anyone, okay?

40:10.213 --> 40:11.549
Scout's honor.

40:11.758 --> 40:15.932
I mean, after all, I wouldn't
want to spoil my reputation none.

40:16.141 --> 40:17.393
None.

40:17.602 --> 40:18.561
I've got an idea.

40:18.729 --> 40:21.442
Let's go spy on the boys.

40:38.640 --> 40:40.100
Safe trip, honey.

41:19.588 --> 41:21.425
Oh, my God!

42:26.709 --> 42:27.961
How was the party?

42:28.337 --> 42:31.050
Well, the good news is
Clarice is gone.

42:31.384 --> 42:32.553
You did it!

42:32.719 --> 42:35.684
The bad news is
she'll be back in a week.

42:35.851 --> 42:37.562
Oh, you didn't.

42:37.979 --> 42:41.569
What's a cool guy like your dad
doing with a witch like her?

42:41.777 --> 42:44.282
It's too bad he didn't
meet Diane first.

42:44.532 --> 42:46.203
Now, she's awesome.

42:46.453 --> 42:49.333
Yeah, they'd be perfect
for each other.

42:53.465 --> 42:56.178
You're not thinking what
I hope you're not thinking.

42:56.763 --> 42:57.974
Want to bet?

42:58.182 --> 42:59.768
But he's getting married!

42:59.977 --> 43:03.400
They got to meet once.
Then they'll fall in love for sure.

43:03.567 --> 43:04.903
How do you know?

43:05.069 --> 43:08.409
Because Diane says, when it happens.
It happens like that.

43:08.785 --> 43:09.870
Okay, so look.

43:10.037 --> 43:13.000
You go back to Diane
and I'll go back to your dad.

43:13.209 --> 43:15.713
Wait! Why not the other way around?

43:15.922 --> 43:18.803
You know what he likes.
And I know what she likes.

43:18.928 --> 43:20.931
They need all the help they can get.

43:21.098 --> 43:23.102
But how will we get them together?

43:36.292 --> 43:38.797
I can't believe I let you
talk me into this.

43:39.005 --> 43:40.801
You're too tense. Relax.

43:41.051 --> 43:44.766
I got 1.000 pounds of animal
under my butt, and she says, "Relax."

43:45.017 --> 43:47.229
Move with the horse
and you'll be fine.

43:47.396 --> 43:50.109
When did you become an expert
all of a sudden?

43:50.401 --> 43:52.656
Ain't you never seen a Western?

43:52.906 --> 43:55.744
Honey, the last Western I saw
was an omelet.

44:02.548 --> 44:05.888
What happened to those
equestrian classes you took?

44:06.096 --> 44:08.809
Are you asking me a question?

44:10.604 --> 44:12.858
Come on.
I'll race you to the lake.

44:13.025 --> 44:15.321
No, no. Slow is good.

44:15.529 --> 44:17.825
I like to enjoy the scenery.

44:19.245 --> 44:23.711
I got spurs that jingle jingle jangle.

44:24.212 --> 44:27.927
As I ride merrily along.

44:28.219 --> 44:30.724
We're doing a good job, aren't we?

44:30.974 --> 44:33.395
I'm finally getting the hang of this.

44:36.275 --> 44:38.196
I'm getting the hang of this!

44:40.574 --> 44:43.872
Oh, come on, Amanda.
My voice isn't that bad!

44:47.671 --> 44:50.676
I been in the desert
On a horse with no name.

44:50.885 --> 44:53.306
It's good to get out of the rain.

44:53.974 --> 44:57.355
Not only is she an excellent rider.
She's a gourmet cook...

44:57.563 --> 44:59.025
...she paints...

44:59.317 --> 45:01.195
...she speaks four languages...

45:01.362 --> 45:04.033
You know, honey.
You could learn a lot from Clarice.

45:04.201 --> 45:05.870
Alyssa, there's a...

45:10.336 --> 45:11.505
Honey!

45:24.278 --> 45:25.739
Come here! Come here!

45:35.173 --> 45:37.218
Where is that girl?

45:38.054 --> 45:39.263
Did you bring it?

45:50.867 --> 45:52.203
Whoa, bud!

45:56.837 --> 45:59.300
Someone turn this thing off!

46:10.821 --> 46:13.784
Stop this right now!
I'm telling you! Stop!

46:20.922 --> 46:22.592
Step on it!

46:30.856 --> 46:32.234
Oh, dear! Oh, my!

46:44.840 --> 46:46.009
Help me!

46:46.259 --> 46:47.804
Somebody help me!

46:49.306 --> 46:50.100
Hang on!

46:56.862 --> 46:58.364
Call 911!

46:58.949 --> 46:59.783
Slow down.

46:59.950 --> 47:01.787
Don't talk to me!
Talk to the horse!

47:01.954 --> 47:03.665
I was talking to the horse!

47:03.874 --> 47:05.251
Okay, it's okay.

47:06.797 --> 47:09.385
I'm on a killer!
They gave me the killer horse!

47:09.635 --> 47:10.427
Relax.

47:20.612 --> 47:21.781
You okay?

47:22.032 --> 47:24.913
I about dropped
my transmission back there.

47:25.121 --> 47:29.712
If it's any consolation, I used to
look like a real jerk on a horse.

47:36.516 --> 47:38.145
How many fingers, cowboy?

47:39.522 --> 47:40.398
Six.

47:40.733 --> 47:42.819
Close enough. Can you stand?

47:47.453 --> 47:49.623
Which is more bruised.
My butt or my ego?

47:49.916 --> 47:51.585
Have someone take a look at that.

47:51.919 --> 47:53.338
- My butt?
- No.

47:53.673 --> 47:55.717
That cut. Right there.

47:56.051 --> 47:57.721
Oh, great.

47:58.180 --> 47:59.975
We have first aid at the camp.

48:00.101 --> 48:02.438
Oh, thanks.
I just live over here.

48:04.483 --> 48:05.694
Are you Roger Callaway?

48:06.111 --> 48:08.115
- I think so.
- The Roger Callaway?

48:08.282 --> 48:10.202
From the Callaway Foundation?

48:10.410 --> 48:11.662
Yeah, that's me.

48:11.914 --> 48:16.421
I'm Diane Barrows. I always wanted
to meet you. My kids love your camp.

48:16.588 --> 48:17.590
You have kids?

48:17.882 --> 48:21.389
They're not mine. I work for
the East Side Children's Center.

48:21.597 --> 48:23.183
Of course.

48:24.811 --> 48:27.149
It was nice to meet you, Mr. Callaway.

48:27.357 --> 48:28.359
Roger, please.

48:31.281 --> 48:33.327
And thank you for saving my life.

48:34.829 --> 48:37.919
And you really should put
some iodine on your butt.

48:38.127 --> 48:39.296
Cut.

48:40.214 --> 48:41.049
Miss Barrows...

48:42.009 --> 48:42.844
b.

48:44.931 --> 48:47.477
I was wondering if
I could offer you iced tea.

48:47.644 --> 48:50.858
I'd love to hear more about
the camp and how it's going.

48:51.151 --> 48:52.570
Only if we walk.

48:52.737 --> 48:54.824
You took the words out of my mouth.

48:55.575 --> 48:56.577
Come on.

48:57.496 --> 48:58.998
Now hold still.

49:03.297 --> 49:05.844
You certainly are an angel of mercy.

49:06.094 --> 49:09.016
- I see worse cuts than this every day.
- Thanks.

49:09.225 --> 49:11.687
My gang always invents
new ways to get hurt.

49:11.897 --> 49:15.069
- You must really love children.
- What's not to love?

49:19.076 --> 49:21.705
- No, really.
- You big baby! Come here.

49:23.710 --> 49:24.711
Ls that better?

49:39.238 --> 49:41.282
I can't hear anything!

49:41.533 --> 49:43.829
We've got to get closer!

49:44.539 --> 49:48.044
You know, you're not at all
what I expected.

49:48.211 --> 49:49.130
Really?

49:49.547 --> 49:51.009
What were you expecting?

49:51.801 --> 49:53.179
Blue blood, for one thing.

49:54.514 --> 49:58.521
I thought you'd be some rich, big.
Old, fat geezer who smokes cigars.

49:58.731 --> 49:59.732
Really?

49:59.941 --> 50:03.155
I made my money the old-fashioned way.
Pure dumb luck.

50:03.322 --> 50:04.157
I doubt that.

50:04.366 --> 50:05.618
I swear to God.

50:05.868 --> 50:09.542
Twelve years ago, a cell phone
was something out of Star rreh.

50:09.667 --> 50:12.964
But I thought it was pretty cool.
So I bought airspace.

50:13.174 --> 50:14.801
Get out!

50:15.845 --> 50:18.182
That's like money out of thin air!

50:18.391 --> 50:20.896
You'll notice I don't carry one.
I hate them.

50:21.104 --> 50:22.273
Excuse me.

50:22.482 --> 50:24.318
Miss Kensington, boss.

50:24.568 --> 50:26.029
She insists.

50:26.948 --> 50:29.661
Excuse me. It's my...
Miss Kensington.

50:32.165 --> 50:33.376
How you doing?

50:34.003 --> 50:36.381
How am I doing?

50:38.552 --> 50:40.263
Please, honey, look.

50:42.184 --> 50:46.984
Do you have any idea
what your daughter has done?

50:47.443 --> 50:50.031
- No, what?
- She spit...

50:50.198 --> 50:51.867
Gum? In your hair?

50:53.830 --> 50:54.748
Are you sure?

50:54.915 --> 50:59.048
Am I sure?
Oh, my God! You should see it!

50:59.214 --> 51:01.344
I'm certain it wasn't intentional.

51:01.552 --> 51:04.349
Look, of course.
You've had a rough day.

51:04.891 --> 51:07.020
Rough is a broken nail, darling.

51:07.187 --> 51:09.692
What I've had is a train wreck!

51:10.150 --> 51:12.571
Just try to calm down.
I'll speak to her.

51:12.738 --> 51:14.325
I'm just going to go now.

51:14.659 --> 51:17.038
Just one second.
One second, please.

51:19.250 --> 51:21.963
What? Is there a woman
there with you?

51:22.173 --> 51:25.678
Yes, there's sort of a woman here.
She's from the camp.

51:27.264 --> 51:30.688
How delightful!
I'm in the middle of a crisis...

51:30.896 --> 51:33.776
...and you're having a bachelor party!

51:34.111 --> 51:35.989
I'm in a meeting. That's all.

51:36.197 --> 51:38.076
It's just a meeting.

51:39.787 --> 51:43.753
No, we're not going to have dinner.
There's nothing going to go on...

51:44.254 --> 51:47.760
Please. I'll see you
at the end of the week.

51:48.595 --> 51:50.306
Me too. Bye-bye.

51:50.473 --> 51:51.809
I'm so sorry.

51:59.949 --> 52:01.618
Sorry about that!

52:04.749 --> 52:08.923
But she squeezed me so hard.
It just sort of popped out.

52:10.217 --> 52:12.137
I don't think she likes me much.

52:12.304 --> 52:15.644
She's been looking forward to
meeting you for months.

52:15.852 --> 52:17.730
Do you know how much she loves kids?

52:18.732 --> 52:20.610
No. Do you?

52:22.114 --> 52:25.536
Well, you are the first kid
I've ever seen her with.

52:25.703 --> 52:27.122
But I'm sure it's a bunch.

52:27.582 --> 52:28.959
And you love her, right?

52:33.175 --> 52:36.390
Like that "Can't eat. Can't sleep.
Reach for the stars...

52:36.557 --> 52:39.395
...over the fence. World Series"
kind of stuff?

52:40.730 --> 52:42.692
Ls that what the dictionary says?

52:42.859 --> 52:45.948
You're marrying her
because Alyssa needs. I mean...

52:46.157 --> 52:47.326
...I need a mother?

52:49.872 --> 52:52.293
I think that's
enough questions for today.

52:52.502 --> 52:53.337
Wait.

52:53.587 --> 52:55.507
I only got one left.

52:56.801 --> 52:57.928
Let's have it.

52:58.345 --> 53:01.435
Who was that pretty woman
out on the patio?

53:03.020 --> 53:04.857
The Roger Callaway?

53:05.942 --> 53:07.946
On a white horse, no less.

53:08.322 --> 53:09.324
So?

53:10.951 --> 53:13.748
He comes riding up, saves my life.

53:13.956 --> 53:16.378
He's probably worth billions.
Totally cute.

53:16.753 --> 53:18.966
Oh, my God! He is so cute.

53:19.216 --> 53:20.218
To top it all off...

53:20.426 --> 53:23.014
...he's, honest to God, a nice guy.

53:23.265 --> 53:25.644
I'm stupid enough
to think he's available.

53:25.811 --> 53:27.648
- Isn't he?
- No.

53:27.857 --> 53:29.526
Ls too.

53:30.612 --> 53:31.864
How would you know?

53:32.072 --> 53:33.575
Was he wearing a ring?

53:36.498 --> 53:40.212
Even if he was available.
He wouldn't be interested in me.

53:40.338 --> 53:41.841
Don't put yourself down.

53:42.049 --> 53:44.345
Guys like him like
girls with food names.

53:46.808 --> 53:49.020
Cookie, Muffin...

53:49.312 --> 53:50.314
...Candy.

53:50.606 --> 53:52.109
They don't marry girls like me.

53:52.401 --> 53:53.653
He did once.

53:54.112 --> 53:55.656
Ls this published somewhere?

53:55.865 --> 53:58.955
Her name was Cathy.
She wasn't a food, but a teacher.

54:00.666 --> 54:02.795
He's even more perfect
than I thought.

54:03.003 --> 54:05.341
I'm cheating.
Give me one of those.

54:06.802 --> 54:08.138
Give me that stick.

54:10.809 --> 54:13.564
Vincenzo, do you believe in magic?

54:13.689 --> 54:14.608
Like card tricks?

54:14.816 --> 54:17.279
No, sparks between two people.

54:17.404 --> 54:19.367
It happens when you least expect it.

54:19.533 --> 54:20.911
Why do you ask?

54:23.415 --> 54:25.252
No reason.

54:25.419 --> 54:28.257
It's been so long since Cathy and...

54:30.386 --> 54:32.264
I didn't think it'd happen again.

54:34.602 --> 54:37.273
That Miss Kensington
is really something.

54:38.025 --> 54:40.070
Well, actually...

54:40.446 --> 54:42.825
...that's not who I meant.

54:44.537 --> 54:45.580
I know.

54:49.211 --> 54:53.595
You're my best man. You're supposed
to come up with words of wisdom now.

54:56.308 --> 54:58.352
Why don't you go for a drive?

54:58.520 --> 55:00.190
See where you end up.

55:11.418 --> 55:13.505
Now, where's he going?

55:22.355 --> 55:23.523
It's the home office.

55:23.732 --> 55:26.862
The Butkises want Amanda.
The paperwork just went through.

55:29.450 --> 55:31.496
Who the hell is this?

55:31.997 --> 55:35.920
Diane Barrows, Since when does
your department okay an adoption...

55:36.129 --> 55:38.550
...without the caseworker's report?

55:39.635 --> 55:41.347
I know these people are nice.

55:43.351 --> 55:45.563
Have you ever met those people?

55:45.772 --> 55:48.819
These people collect kids.
They'll take anybody.

56:07.101 --> 56:08.980
Where is Diane Barrows?

56:09.189 --> 56:11.067
I think she's in the office.

56:12.027 --> 56:14.573
Let me just run this by you
one more time.

56:14.782 --> 56:17.620
Just hear me out one more time.

56:18.706 --> 56:23.423
I know I don't make that much money.
And I know I'm a little bit single.

56:23.590 --> 56:25.051
But I want to adopt Amanda.

56:26.762 --> 56:29.517
Are you laughing at me?
He's laughing at me!

56:31.562 --> 56:33.357
You stupid jerk!

56:43.459 --> 56:44.711
What?

56:44.919 --> 56:46.798
Oh, it's you.

56:48.593 --> 56:49.804
Ls this a bad time?

56:50.262 --> 56:51.765
A bad time?

56:52.058 --> 56:53.227
For a meeting?

56:54.688 --> 56:57.276
No. I'm having a problem
with one of my kids.

56:57.442 --> 56:58.653
Anything I can do?

56:58.862 --> 57:02.994
You've already saved my life.
What can I do for you?

57:04.663 --> 57:06.542
I want to apologize for yesterday.

57:06.709 --> 57:09.714
It was very rude.
I shouldn't have taken that call.

57:09.881 --> 57:11.300
I'd like to make it up.

57:11.468 --> 57:13.388
Okay, then give me your car.

57:17.144 --> 57:21.026
Perhaps we could discuss it
at a pizza joint I saw in town.

57:21.360 --> 57:23.406
I'm sorry. I can't.

57:25.409 --> 57:28.373
I understand.
Maybe some other time, then.

57:28.582 --> 57:31.086
No, it's not like that.

57:31.295 --> 57:35.928
I'm on duty today in the mess hall.
It's my kids' turn to serve.

57:36.136 --> 57:37.305
Oh, I see.

57:37.515 --> 57:40.353
If your heart's set on Italian.
You could join us.

57:40.728 --> 57:41.939
We're having...

57:42.106 --> 57:43.733
...macaroni and cheese.

57:43.900 --> 57:45.069
And peach cobbler?

57:45.404 --> 57:47.240
Oh, yeah, All you can eat.

57:56.173 --> 57:59.095
Darling, Craig can meet
the preident on Sunday.

57:59.262 --> 58:02.100
I need bridesmaids!

58:02.685 --> 58:04.521
You must come.

58:05.481 --> 58:07.151
Fabulous!

58:07.359 --> 58:10.282
There's my other line.
Love you. Mean it. Ciao.

58:12.243 --> 58:13.662
M.

58:14.372 --> 58:18.213
Why do you keep bothering me
with numbers? It's my wedding.

58:18.463 --> 58:20.926
Whatever it costs, just get it!

58:31.403 --> 58:33.114
It's a cozy little spot!

58:33.281 --> 58:35.118
When were you last here?

58:35.285 --> 58:36.329
It must be 10 years!

58:36.537 --> 58:38.123
Ten years?

58:38.290 --> 58:41.128
Did you build the camp
and never come back?

58:41.254 --> 58:43.968
No, it was my wife's idea.
She had a big heart.

58:44.260 --> 58:45.262
Had?

58:45.595 --> 58:48.142
She passed away when Alyssa was born.

58:48.308 --> 58:49.644
Sorry.

58:49.978 --> 58:53.484
I just never could come back.
Until now, that is.

59:09.680 --> 59:10.849
Here you go!

59:11.266 --> 59:13.312
Hey, Carmen. Where's Amanda?

59:13.520 --> 59:16.025
I don't know.
One minute she's behind me...

59:16.275 --> 59:19.365
Would you get her? I want to
introduce her to somebody.

59:21.994 --> 59:26.418
I'm having the hardest time keeping
tabs on her. She keeps running off.

59:26.585 --> 59:29.507
Tell me about it.
I got one just like her at home.

01:00:01.732 --> 01:00:03.234
What are you doing?

01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:06.866
I'm cleaning this window.
Look at it. It's filthy.

01:00:07.075 --> 01:00:09.121
Diane wants to see you. Come on.

01:00:12.251 --> 01:00:13.503
Hey, my hat!

01:00:17.218 --> 01:00:18.846
Do something, Alyssa!

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.476
Here she comes.

01:00:27.737 --> 01:00:29.991
My compliments to the chef.

01:00:31.244 --> 01:00:33.330
Amanda, take that thing off.

01:00:35.042 --> 01:00:37.881
Let her keep it on.
It might be the latest thing.

01:01:19.163 --> 01:01:21.125
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:01:22.711 --> 01:01:23.796
Did you just snort?

01:01:28.889 --> 01:01:31.310
I suppose you think this is funny?

01:01:33.146 --> 01:01:36.820
Well, maybe you'll get
a little chuckle out of this.

01:01:36.987 --> 01:01:38.865
You wouldn't dare!

01:01:41.077 --> 01:01:42.581
Food fight!

01:01:59.945 --> 01:02:01.698
That was great!

01:02:01.865 --> 01:02:04.369
I couldn't have done it better myself.

01:02:04.536 --> 01:02:06.749
I almost had a heart attack.

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:28.955
I guess that's what they mean
by "eat and run."

01:02:29.164 --> 01:02:31.084
We need doggie bags.

01:02:31.251 --> 01:02:35.092
Oh, dear. Look at me.
I am covered in cobbler.

01:02:35.258 --> 01:02:36.636
You look good in peach.

01:02:36.761 --> 01:02:38.974
Leave it. I may still be hungry.

01:02:41.478 --> 01:02:44.400
I can't believe you hit me
with the butter.

01:02:44.984 --> 01:02:49.117
I didn't start it. You just talk
to that short-order cook of yours.

01:02:49.284 --> 01:02:51.120
Oh yeah. Where is she, anyway?

01:02:51.287 --> 01:02:53.458
Look at your head.

01:02:53.917 --> 01:02:57.340
If you want to get cleaned up.
There's showers over there.

01:02:58.550 --> 01:03:01.055
I've got a better idea.
Will you excuse me?

01:03:01.264 --> 01:03:03.977
And maybe hold some of that?
Pardon me.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.456
What's wrong with him?

01:03:15.623 --> 01:03:19.463
Beats me.
I've never seen him act like this.

01:03:31.359 --> 01:03:33.572
I think he's gone mental.

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:36.202
He's got a lot on his mind.

01:03:40.376 --> 01:03:42.880
Don't you know
not to swim after you eat?

01:03:43.172 --> 01:03:44.550
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

01:03:44.675 --> 01:03:46.345
I got a cramp!

01:03:46.512 --> 01:03:48.140
I can't swim!

01:03:54.902 --> 01:03:56.822
No fair. I saved you.

01:03:57.823 --> 01:03:59.284
It's too cold.

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:01.330
I'm not going in there.

01:04:06.214 --> 01:04:09.177
Come on!
I don't want to save you right now.

01:04:11.849 --> 01:04:14.895
All right, buster.
You better be worth it.

01:04:23.411 --> 01:04:24.580
You're not funny.

01:04:27.544 --> 01:04:29.046
Oh, my God!

01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:32.177
Say...

01:04:33.137 --> 01:04:34.890
...a guy could drown waiting for you.

01:04:35.057 --> 01:04:37.145
Callaway, I'm going to kill you!

01:04:37.478 --> 01:04:38.689
Bonzai!

01:04:41.861 --> 01:04:44.866
Roger, I am going to kill you!

01:04:46.077 --> 01:04:47.120
It's working.

01:04:47.287 --> 01:04:48.790
Look at them.

01:04:51.253 --> 01:04:53.507
Now that's more like it.

01:04:56.012 --> 01:04:58.516
Roger, darling? Anyone home?

01:05:00.979 --> 01:05:05.195
Miss Kensington! What a surprise.
We weren't expecting you.

01:05:05.403 --> 01:05:07.491
Yes, I know. Where's Roger?

01:05:08.116 --> 01:05:11.331
Mr. Callaway is out for the afternoon.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.086
I see.

01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:17.634
Would you please tell him
I wish to speak with him?

01:05:17.801 --> 01:05:18.719
Yes, ma'am.

01:05:18.928 --> 01:05:20.389
Thank you so much.

01:05:25.732 --> 01:05:27.026
I'd like a Diet Coke.

01:05:27.443 --> 01:05:29.906
One Diet Coke, coming up.

01:05:32.828 --> 01:05:34.330
With lime.

01:05:45.017 --> 01:05:48.314
Awfully early in the day
to be looking at stars.

01:05:59.376 --> 01:06:01.922
What do we have here?

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:13.359
You can't always be this much fun.
It wouldn't be fair.

01:06:13.567 --> 01:06:14.402
Trust me.

01:06:14.694 --> 01:06:16.949
I haven't done this in years.

01:06:17.074 --> 01:06:18.493
Well, it feels good.

01:06:19.787 --> 01:06:21.290
It feels better every second.

01:06:22.751 --> 01:06:24.129
- Don't move.
- Why?

01:06:24.421 --> 01:06:25.590
There's a thing.

01:06:25.757 --> 01:06:27.676
What do you mean "a thing"?

01:06:28.553 --> 01:06:30.056
A bug?

01:06:30.974 --> 01:06:33.646
A dreaded maraschino bug.

01:06:33.813 --> 01:06:35.607
It's highly poisonous.

01:06:36.317 --> 01:06:38.571
And you wanted to go for pizza.

01:06:44.081 --> 01:06:46.042
I almost didn't come over at all.

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:48.339
I'm glad you did.

01:07:02.322 --> 01:07:04.033
What was that?

01:07:05.661 --> 01:07:08.459
- It's a sign.
- What do you mean "a sign"?

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:10.670
I don't know.

01:07:11.964 --> 01:07:13.885
I think I know what you mean.

01:07:14.594 --> 01:07:16.681
It's your Miss Kensington, right?

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.189
I'm getting married next month.

01:07:21.941 --> 01:07:24.153
Well, of course you are!

01:07:35.925 --> 01:07:39.430
So what was this?
Just sort of a last fling?

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.851
I didn't know.
I was hoping to find out.

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:44.648
Don't worry about it.
I can help you out.

01:07:44.858 --> 01:07:46.777
It was nice to meet you.

01:07:47.069 --> 01:07:49.073
And thanks for the camp.

01:07:49.532 --> 01:07:51.786
Oh, by the way, congratulations!

01:07:51.953 --> 01:07:53.789
Diane, please.

01:07:55.376 --> 01:07:56.587
You know what?

01:07:56.796 --> 01:07:58.298
This just kills me.

01:07:58.965 --> 01:08:01.720
We might've hit this one
out of the park.

01:08:01.888 --> 01:08:03.975
It was there, I know it.

01:08:04.183 --> 01:08:06.271
That "can't eat. Can't sleep...

01:08:06.437 --> 01:08:08.567
...reach for the stars.
Over the fence...

01:08:08.733 --> 01:08:10.778
...World Series" kind of thing.

01:08:13.199 --> 01:08:14.410
Oh, well.

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:23.551
I've got to get a dictionary.

01:08:25.054 --> 01:08:27.600
They were so close!

01:08:28.102 --> 01:08:31.399
Grownups, they think too much.

01:08:32.276 --> 01:08:33.944
I give up.

01:08:34.112 --> 01:08:35.698
No, we mustn't!

01:08:35.908 --> 01:08:37.702
And why mustn't we?

01:08:37.911 --> 01:08:40.917
Because third time's a charm. Right?

01:08:41.501 --> 01:08:42.920
Right.

01:08:47.261 --> 01:08:48.764
Boss!

01:08:48.973 --> 01:08:50.392
It's Miss Kensington.

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.688
Thanks. I'll take it down here.

01:08:53.856 --> 01:08:54.858
Not here.

01:08:55.108 --> 01:08:56.612
Up there.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.618
Up there?

01:09:00.827 --> 01:09:02.246
Afraid so.

01:09:06.045 --> 01:09:08.173
Roger, darling!

01:09:08.341 --> 01:09:11.763
Clarice! Your hair.
You're here!

01:09:13.265 --> 01:09:15.478
What did you do?
Fall in the lake?

01:09:15.729 --> 01:09:19.234
It's the funniest thing...
Shouldn't you be in New York?

01:09:19.444 --> 01:09:21.907
I couldn't bear to be away
a moment longer.

01:09:22.115 --> 01:09:23.576
You were just gone a day.

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:27.792
I know! And I was positively
miserable the entire time.

01:09:28.001 --> 01:09:30.673
So I've decided we mustn't
wait another day.

01:09:30.881 --> 01:09:31.716
To what?

01:09:31.883 --> 01:09:35.765
To be married, silly.
Next month seems like an eternity.

01:09:36.224 --> 01:09:38.562
When two people are
as much in love as we...

01:09:38.812 --> 01:09:41.442
...I say.
"What's wrong with tomorrow"?

01:09:42.527 --> 01:09:43.361
Tomorrow?

01:09:44.197 --> 01:09:47.118
Darling, you haven't said
a word about my hair.

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:52.837
Okay, listen to this.

01:09:53.462 --> 01:09:56.343
"Dear Roger.
You are so totally fresh.

01:09:56.553 --> 01:09:59.056
Just thinking about you
drives me mental.

01:09:59.474 --> 01:10:02.104
Meet me where we met
with the horses.

01:10:02.313 --> 01:10:04.650
Seven dclock tonight.
Love, Diane."

01:10:04.859 --> 01:10:06.153
How's that?

01:10:06.528 --> 01:10:07.906
Very romantic.

01:10:08.073 --> 01:10:09.576
Want to hear mine?

01:10:10.244 --> 01:10:11.287
"Dear Diane...

01:10:14.084 --> 01:10:17.966
Dear Diane, ever since
I saw you riding the horse...

01:10:18.133 --> 01:10:19.635
...I can't stop thinking about it.

01:10:19.885 --> 01:10:22.683
And I know we were disturbed
at the lake...

01:10:22.808 --> 01:10:26.815
...but I must see you again
where I saved your life, at 7:30.

01:10:28.151 --> 01:10:30.864
Yours truly, Roger Callaway."

01:10:43.762 --> 01:10:46.726
There you are, my little
gum-chewing assailant.

01:10:47.436 --> 01:10:48.312
You're back!

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.650
What? No big hug "hello"?

01:10:50.858 --> 01:10:55.032
- You're not supposed to be here.
- Ln a perfect world, neither are you.

01:10:55.367 --> 01:10:57.161
We're leaving for the city.

01:10:57.370 --> 01:10:59.666
Right now? It's too soon!

01:11:00.501 --> 01:11:03.423
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

01:11:03.882 --> 01:11:06.762
We're leaving tonight.

01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:09.350
This little act of yours
is getting old.

01:11:09.559 --> 01:11:10.770
What act?

01:11:11.145 --> 01:11:13.065
Oh, please.

01:11:13.483 --> 01:11:16.780
When I was your age.
I'd been through three stepmothers.

01:11:16.988 --> 01:11:21.372
I know all the lengths girls go through
to keep Daddy all to themselves.

01:11:21.539 --> 01:11:24.252
You got that all wrong, lady.

01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:26.673
Alyssa, don't be rude.
I'm talking.

01:11:27.549 --> 01:11:28.468
Where was I?

01:11:29.094 --> 01:11:30.262
Oh, yes.

01:11:30.430 --> 01:11:34.562
You had Roger to yourself
for nine wonderful years.

01:11:34.812 --> 01:11:37.484
But after tomorrow.
I'm the woman of the house.

01:11:37.776 --> 01:11:41.324
And you're off to a year-round
boarding school.

01:11:41.491 --> 01:11:42.702
Possibly in Tibet.

01:11:44.288 --> 01:11:46.083
Did you say tomorrow?

01:11:50.007 --> 01:11:51.760
Should I have come here?

01:11:53.847 --> 01:11:55.266
Yes, stupid.

01:11:55.475 --> 01:12:00.191
He's only worth about $20 billion.
For God's sakes!

01:12:00.401 --> 01:12:03.531
Great! Now I'm just after him
for his money.

01:12:03.739 --> 01:12:05.409
How shallow is that?

01:12:05.618 --> 01:12:08.415
I liked him before
I knew he was rich.

01:12:10.668 --> 01:12:12.297
So I should've come here.

01:12:12.756 --> 01:12:14.801
He's a little bit engaged.

01:12:18.725 --> 01:12:21.647
I've never met her.
So maybe that doesn't count.

01:12:27.490 --> 01:12:29.494
Come on, ladies. Perk up.

01:12:37.050 --> 01:12:38.260
Come on, Amanda!

01:12:38.469 --> 01:12:40.723
We're missing the fireworks!

01:12:43.937 --> 01:12:46.733
This is Miss Van Dyke
from Children's Services.

01:12:46.942 --> 01:12:48.111
Hello there.

01:12:48.403 --> 01:12:51.909
I believe I have
some very good news for you.

01:12:52.536 --> 01:12:55.708
Come to Mama, sweetheart!

01:12:59.715 --> 01:13:04.307
I feel pretty ding-dang-dong stupid.

01:13:05.726 --> 01:13:07.521
But my name's Amanda!

01:13:07.729 --> 01:13:09.148
Alyssa, stop it.

01:13:10.442 --> 01:13:11.903
Come on, honey.

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:15.953
Do we have to listen to this
the whole way?

01:13:19.835 --> 01:13:22.673
Oh, great.
Now I'm going to be road kill.

01:13:30.144 --> 01:13:32.566
Wait a minute!
What are you doing?

01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:34.987
Hl.

01:13:36.949 --> 01:13:39.662
You were supposed to protect her!

01:13:39.829 --> 01:13:42.167
You could've slit their tires!
Anything!

01:13:42.334 --> 01:13:43.586
They had paperwork.

01:13:43.795 --> 01:13:44.672
What paperwork?

01:13:44.838 --> 01:13:46.883
We couldn't find you.

01:13:47.092 --> 01:13:49.304
Did you want us to
lie in front of the van?

01:13:50.181 --> 01:13:51.225
I would have.

01:13:53.103 --> 01:13:55.107
I'm taking the Jeep.

01:13:55.315 --> 01:13:56.484
That's the camms.

01:13:56.693 --> 01:13:58.906
Oh, don't you keep me here!

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:03.705
Lots of tie-ups.
It's 20 minutes for the Lincoln.

01:14:03.914 --> 01:14:07.379
Ten for the Holland.
The BQE is backed up for two miles.

01:14:07.545 --> 01:14:10.509
If you're taking the Van Wyck.
Allow an extra 15.

01:14:10.677 --> 01:14:12.555
Just stay out of midtown.

01:14:12.721 --> 01:14:16.020
It'll be wall-to-wall limos.
As Clarice Kensington...

01:14:16.186 --> 01:14:18.649
...finally lands her man.

01:14:19.943 --> 01:14:23.240
Now, these nincompoops are
your new brothers and sisters.

01:14:23.449 --> 01:14:24.868
From the left, you got...

01:14:25.119 --> 01:14:26.914
...Bubba, Bridget, Brenda...

01:14:27.122 --> 01:14:30.462
...Bonnie, Billy, Bobby, Ben...

01:14:30.629 --> 01:14:32.340
...and little Harry. Jr.

01:14:32.632 --> 01:14:34.261
Now, he's ours.

01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:37.057
There's been a big mistake.

01:14:37.224 --> 01:14:39.979
You see, my name is not Amanda.

01:14:40.563 --> 01:14:42.150
We know that, honey.

01:14:42.442 --> 01:14:43.277
You do?

01:14:43.486 --> 01:14:47.284
Sure. And you will never
have to be Amanda again.

01:14:47.493 --> 01:14:50.623
That's right. Because from now on.
You're going to be...

01:14:50.748 --> 01:14:54.046
...Little Betty Butkis.

01:14:54.588 --> 01:14:56.509
Give Betty some Coco Puffs.

01:14:57.886 --> 01:14:59.389
And after breakfast...

01:14:59.597 --> 01:15:02.812
...we're going to go down
and see where your daddy works.

01:15:03.104 --> 01:15:05.232
Isn't that going to be fun?

01:15:10.492 --> 01:15:11.869
Callaway residence.

01:15:12.037 --> 01:15:13.206
One moment, please.

01:15:13.414 --> 01:15:15.417
Miss Callaway, it's for you.

01:15:17.255 --> 01:15:19.174
Hello, this is Miss Callaway.

01:15:19.341 --> 01:15:22.848
I can't talk long. It's me.

01:15:24.309 --> 01:15:26.145
Or should I say...

01:15:28.483 --> 01:15:29.860
...Betty Butkis.

01:15:30.027 --> 01:15:32.114
Oh, no! I'm adopted?

01:15:36.205 --> 01:15:38.334
Are those guys scary or what?

01:15:38.751 --> 01:15:40.045
What happened yesterday?

01:15:40.254 --> 01:15:41.464
Are you sitting down?

01:15:41.673 --> 01:15:43.092
Yeah, kind of.

01:15:43.677 --> 01:15:45.096
Clarice moved up the wedding.

01:15:45.346 --> 01:15:46.724
Your dad's getting married...

01:15:46.849 --> 01:15:49.562
...in two hours and 12 minutes.

01:15:50.064 --> 01:15:52.275
- What do we do now?
- I don't know.

01:15:52.485 --> 01:15:54.571
But it'll have to be something major.

01:15:54.863 --> 01:15:55.865
And quick.

01:15:56.074 --> 01:15:58.411
You've got to get me out of here.

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:01.166
These people aren't
just scary, they're...

01:16:10.349 --> 01:16:14.900
New kids aren't allowed to use
the phone. Butkis rules.

01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:23.749
Hey, Vin. You've been taking care
of Alyssa all her life, right?

01:16:23.916 --> 01:16:25.961
Oh, no, Alyssa. Not again.

01:16:26.086 --> 01:16:27.297
Answer the question.

01:16:27.422 --> 01:16:31.262
Yes. From the day she was...
From the day you were born.

01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:34.727
So you know pretty well
everything about her?

01:16:35.269 --> 01:16:37.023
Every freckle, every bruise...

01:16:37.232 --> 01:16:38.818
...every scar?

01:16:39.068 --> 01:16:40.070
You could say that.

01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:43.284
Bet you don't remember this one.
Do you?

01:16:43.994 --> 01:16:45.831
No, that one escapes me.

01:16:45.998 --> 01:16:47.876
Broken bottle sliding into home.

01:16:50.297 --> 01:16:51.674
This one?

01:16:53.135 --> 01:16:55.389
Rusty nail right through my shoe.

01:16:55.598 --> 01:16:57.059
Bled for six blocks.

01:16:58.186 --> 01:16:59.146
How about here?

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:01.567
Ever seen this?

01:17:01.776 --> 01:17:02.820
When was that?

01:17:02.945 --> 01:17:06.450
Roman candle last Fourth of July.
Right in the head.

01:17:06.952 --> 01:17:08.788
My God!

01:17:08.955 --> 01:17:10.584
You're not Alyssa!

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:12.462
Nope. Name's Amanda.

01:17:12.712 --> 01:17:13.589
Put her there.

01:17:13.881 --> 01:17:16.594
Identical strangers?

01:17:16.802 --> 01:17:19.015
Holy mackerel, it's amazing!

01:17:19.182 --> 01:17:21.103
Yeah. And it's weird too.

01:17:21.394 --> 01:17:24.943
But if you're here with us.
Then Alyssa is...

01:17:25.151 --> 01:17:26.445
ln a lot of trouble.

01:17:26.654 --> 01:17:29.117
- I got to tell Mr. Callaway.
- Oh, no.

01:17:29.325 --> 01:17:31.036
Wait! You can't tell him yet.

01:17:31.538 --> 01:17:34.501
We got to get him to see
Diane before the wedding.

01:17:34.710 --> 01:17:38.175
They'll fall in love.
And Clarice will be history.

01:17:39.302 --> 01:17:42.432
Where the hell is everybody?

01:17:45.521 --> 01:17:48.150
I sure hope you got a plan.

01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:22.128
What are you doing here?

01:18:22.421 --> 01:18:25.218
I came for Mr. Callaway's
daughter. Alyssa.

01:18:26.553 --> 01:18:27.722
You got her.

01:18:27.973 --> 01:18:29.392
I want her back.

01:18:30.143 --> 01:18:31.563
What are you talking about?

01:18:31.771 --> 01:18:34.693
I don't have her.
I don't even know her.

01:18:35.236 --> 01:18:36.739
Yes, you do.

01:18:37.991 --> 01:18:40.454
This is Alyssa Callaway.

01:18:40.662 --> 01:18:43.918
No, you'd better get
your eyes checked because...

01:18:44.084 --> 01:18:46.381
...this is a little girl
named Amanda.

01:18:47.383 --> 01:18:49.887
This is your Amanda.

01:18:58.569 --> 01:19:00.489
Oh, my God!

01:19:01.366 --> 01:19:03.494
Look, they're identical.

01:19:05.707 --> 01:19:07.210
This is amazing.

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:09.339
Yeah. And it's weird too.

01:19:10.633 --> 01:19:11.509
I understand...

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:14.974
...that through some simple mix-up...

01:19:15.099 --> 01:19:18.605
...that Alyssa is in the care
of Child Services.

01:19:19.106 --> 01:19:21.068
I've been authorized to tell you...

01:19:21.402 --> 01:19:25.159
...that if I get her back.
There'll be no legal entanglements.

01:19:29.541 --> 01:19:32.505
She's not exactly with me here.

01:19:34.008 --> 01:19:35.719
She's been...

01:19:36.805 --> 01:19:38.266
Well, she was adopted.

01:19:38.558 --> 01:19:40.979
Then you better un-adopt her quick.

01:19:41.229 --> 01:19:44.360
Mr. Callaway's getting married
in 90 minutes.

01:19:44.611 --> 01:19:46.655
He's expecting
his real daughter there.

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:48.785
Ninety minutes?

01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:51.873
I can't get to Staten Island
and back in 90 minutes.

01:19:52.082 --> 01:19:56.048
Well, could I suggest that
you go really, really fast?

01:19:58.051 --> 01:19:58.845
Here.

01:19:59.137 --> 01:20:01.266
If you get into any trouble...

01:20:01.474 --> 01:20:02.893
...call this number.

01:20:03.896 --> 01:20:05.773
Ask for Lou.

01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:11.075
Lou who?

01:20:23.389 --> 01:20:25.893
Well, hey. Look at this mess.

01:20:26.311 --> 01:20:27.354
Clean it up.

01:20:27.605 --> 01:20:29.483
You clean it.

01:20:30.276 --> 01:20:32.989
Put a cork in it, okay?
He's management.

01:20:35.827 --> 01:20:38.541
My father's Roger Callaway...

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:42.506
...and when he finds out
what you're doing here...

01:20:42.673 --> 01:20:46.471
...he's going to buy this whole town
and kick you out of it.

01:20:46.848 --> 01:20:50.772
Roger Callaway? Then how come
you ain't at his wedding?

01:20:58.243 --> 01:21:00.455
Come on, Diane. You can do it.

01:21:01.207 --> 01:21:03.085
We might have to stall a bit.

01:21:04.170 --> 01:21:05.381
How?

01:21:06.132 --> 01:21:07.384
How should I know?

01:21:07.634 --> 01:21:09.597
You're the brains of this operation.

01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:13.645
I must be crazy.
But I am not going in that church.

01:21:13.771 --> 01:21:18.070
No matter what happens.
I am not going in that church.

01:21:27.796 --> 01:21:29.884
It's only natural to be nervous.

01:21:31.511 --> 01:21:34.933
- I was thinking about the World Series.
- Baseball?

01:21:37.104 --> 01:21:39.192
Did you ever hit a home run?

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:40.694
Not recently.

01:21:41.403 --> 01:21:43.908
You know when it's
bottom of the ninth...

01:21:44.117 --> 01:21:46.079
...the bases are loaded...

01:21:46.287 --> 01:21:49.544
...and you know the next one's
coming right down the middle?

01:21:50.754 --> 01:21:52.048
And then...

01:21:53.509 --> 01:21:55.554
...you just connect.

01:21:56.765 --> 01:21:58.517
And for an instant...

01:21:59.061 --> 01:22:03.610
...you know that it's going
over the fence and out of the park...

01:22:04.654 --> 01:22:06.908
...further than
you could ever imagine.

01:22:07.033 --> 01:22:08.869
Yeah, that's a great feeling.

01:22:21.392 --> 01:22:23.229
Clarice hates baseball.

01:22:29.365 --> 01:22:32.370
Come on, Sea Biscuit.
Don't fail me now.

01:22:46.897 --> 01:22:49.317
Hello! Hello!

01:22:49.527 --> 01:22:51.321
You looking for a Butkis?

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.951
You looking for a Butkis?

01:22:54.535 --> 01:22:57.332
Yes, I am.
Do you know where he is?

01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:59.837
At the salvage yard, where else?

01:23:00.296 --> 01:23:02.550
Harry works those kids to the bone.

01:23:02.717 --> 01:23:03.635
What?

01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:06.056
Why do you think he's got so many?

01:23:15.615 --> 01:23:17.076
Can I use your phone?

01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:19.288
Yeah, sure. No charge.

01:23:33.063 --> 01:23:35.109
We've been looking for you...

01:23:35.317 --> 01:23:36.987
...Your Highness.

01:23:37.655 --> 01:23:39.491
Leave me alone!

01:23:39.742 --> 01:23:41.244
But Your Majesty...

01:23:41.453 --> 01:23:43.165
...we brought you something.

01:23:43.332 --> 01:23:45.503
Yeah, something to make you feel...

01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:47.172
...more at home.

01:23:49.217 --> 01:23:52.640
I knew somebody in this church
would have a Prozac.

01:23:52.974 --> 01:23:55.186
What is taking so long?

01:23:55.436 --> 01:23:57.315
Relax. Enjoy the moment.

01:23:57.482 --> 01:24:00.362
This is the happiest day
of your life.

01:24:01.156 --> 01:24:02.366
I'm happy.

01:24:02.533 --> 01:24:04.369
Don't I look happy?

01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:08.543
This is me happy! See?

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:11.549
Happy, happy, happy!

01:24:11.758 --> 01:24:14.053
Let's get the show on the road!

01:24:14.638 --> 01:24:16.725
Here's your royal throne...

01:24:16.892 --> 01:24:19.146
...Alyssa Callaway.

01:24:19.313 --> 01:24:22.652
Hail, Betty.
Oueen of the scrap heap.

01:24:22.861 --> 01:24:24.781
Hail, Betty!

01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:27.578
My name's Alyssa Callaway!

01:24:27.786 --> 01:24:30.458
Yeah, right. And I'm Princess Di.

01:24:35.759 --> 01:24:38.681
Attention, Harry Butkis.

01:24:38.849 --> 01:24:41.102
We're here to pick up
Alyssa Callaway.

01:24:41.269 --> 01:24:44.275
All you kids in the yard.
Stand clear.

01:24:44.442 --> 01:24:46.361
We're coming in.

01:25:12.033 --> 01:25:12.868
Told you!

01:25:21.007 --> 01:25:22.385
Alyssa Callaway?

01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:24.764
I've got to get you to that church.

01:25:25.724 --> 01:25:26.976
That is my kid!

01:25:27.144 --> 01:25:28.855
Out of my way, piece of junk!

01:25:29.022 --> 01:25:31.276
I would love to kill you...

01:25:31.485 --> 01:25:34.865
...before I turn you over
to Social Services.

01:25:59.493 --> 01:26:01.831
Alyssa, go ahead. Hurry!

01:26:04.085 --> 01:26:05.963
Oh, God!

01:26:06.381 --> 01:26:07.967
Hi. How you doing?

01:26:08.259 --> 01:26:09.303
Good to see you.

01:26:11.515 --> 01:26:15.063
Hi, Granny. Nice hat.
Thanks for coming.

01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:17.108
Get moving!

01:26:35.516 --> 01:26:38.355
Any slower and she'd be
walking backwards.

01:26:40.317 --> 01:26:42.487
She's just not herself today.

01:26:45.158 --> 01:26:48.289
We'll never make it.
We only have 10 minutes.

01:26:48.456 --> 01:26:52.005
So Lou, how close can you land
this thing to the church?

01:26:52.172 --> 01:26:53.883
Central Park close enough?

01:26:54.091 --> 01:26:56.721
Central Park? The Central Park?

01:26:57.014 --> 01:26:58.391
That'll do.

01:27:38.463 --> 01:27:42.428
Who would've thought my first girl
would be the last to get married?

01:27:43.722 --> 01:27:45.183
Shut up!

01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:47.855
Enough of this.

01:28:06.972 --> 01:28:08.810
I'm here. Let's do it.

01:28:10.187 --> 01:28:12.650
We are gathered here
in the sight of God...

01:28:12.817 --> 01:28:14.736
...to join in holy matrimony...

01:28:15.112 --> 01:28:17.199
...Clarice and Roger.

01:28:20.329 --> 01:28:23.836
I'm not going in the church.
I'm not going in the church.

01:28:29.513 --> 01:28:30.723
Oh, no.

01:28:31.141 --> 01:28:33.144
Not another horse.

01:28:34.021 --> 01:28:35.065
Come on!

01:28:36.150 --> 01:28:37.277
Fine!

01:28:38.028 --> 01:28:39.656
Where is the driver?

01:28:42.244 --> 01:28:43.496
Hey, buddy!

01:28:43.914 --> 01:28:46.669
Take us to St. Bart's.
It's an emergency.

01:28:47.045 --> 01:28:50.092
Yeah? So's this.
I'm on my break!

01:28:55.852 --> 01:28:57.856
Thank you for all your help, bud.

01:29:04.117 --> 01:29:06.079
That's my horse!

01:29:10.087 --> 01:29:11.839
Faster, horsey, faster!

01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:15.930
To have and to hold.
For richer or poorer...

01:29:16.138 --> 01:29:18.601
...in sickness and health.
As long as you live?

01:29:18.810 --> 01:29:21.022
I do. I really do. Now him.

01:29:24.821 --> 01:29:27.576
Hit the brakes! Hit the brakes!

01:29:34.630 --> 01:29:37.344
- Hang on!
- I'm hanging on!

01:29:38.303 --> 01:29:39.806
What street's it on again?

01:29:40.224 --> 01:29:42.352
54th and Park.

01:29:42.562 --> 01:29:43.563
Are we there yet?

01:29:43.730 --> 01:29:44.606
Almost!

01:29:44.815 --> 01:29:45.984
Signal!

01:29:48.322 --> 01:29:50.241
And do you, Roger...

01:29:50.409 --> 01:29:52.454
...take this woman, Clarice...

01:29:52.621 --> 01:29:54.833
...to be your lawful wedded wife?

01:29:55.125 --> 01:29:56.544
To have and to hold...

01:29:56.753 --> 01:29:58.089
...for richer, for poorer...

01:29:58.799 --> 01:30:01.762
...and in sickness and in health...

01:30:01.929 --> 01:30:04.600
...as long as you both shall live?

01:30:24.804 --> 01:30:27.017
Oh, God! We made it.

01:30:31.357 --> 01:30:32.693
Aren't you coming?

01:30:34.154 --> 01:30:37.076
No, I think I'll just wait
for Amanda out here.

01:30:38.036 --> 01:30:39.288
Diane Barrows!

01:30:39.455 --> 01:30:41.960
Get your butt up here...

01:30:42.586 --> 01:30:44.214
...this instant!

01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:48.138
I'll stand in the back...

01:30:48.346 --> 01:30:50.350
...and take a little look-see.

01:30:51.143 --> 01:30:52.187
I...

01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:44.697
I can't.

01:31:51.418 --> 01:31:53.964
Excuse me? What did you say?

01:31:54.299 --> 01:31:55.926
I'm so sorry. I can't.

01:32:01.269 --> 01:32:03.357
I should've said something earlier.

01:32:11.997 --> 01:32:13.541
I'm in love with someone else.

01:32:26.147 --> 01:32:27.775
I guess I deserve that.

01:32:30.656 --> 01:32:33.911
This is all your fault!

01:32:37.083 --> 01:32:38.252
Lady...

01:32:38.377 --> 01:32:39.964
...if you touch that child...

01:32:40.173 --> 01:32:43.804
...I'll pop you one, so help me God.

01:33:00.083 --> 01:33:01.502
Oh, my God!

01:33:01.753 --> 01:33:03.130
There's two of them!

01:33:03.423 --> 01:33:05.343
It's a conspiracy!

01:33:05.844 --> 01:33:08.474
Well, at least I'll get to
hit one of you.

01:33:11.019 --> 01:33:12.481
Back off, Barbie!

01:33:14.526 --> 01:33:15.736
And by the way...

01:33:16.028 --> 01:33:18.993
...you have a little bit
of something on your teeth.

01:33:21.539 --> 01:33:25.880
I have never been more
humiliated in my life!

01:33:31.348 --> 01:33:32.225
Want to bet?

01:33:41.366 --> 01:33:42.702
Daddy!

01:33:46.124 --> 01:33:47.418
Oh my God!

01:33:53.596 --> 01:33:55.725
About time you showed up.

01:33:55.976 --> 01:33:57.980
We got here soon as we could.

01:33:58.480 --> 01:33:59.816
Hi, Daddy.

01:34:08.624 --> 01:34:09.499
Impossible.

01:34:10.168 --> 01:34:12.714
Nothing's impossible.
Right. Alyssa?

01:34:13.215 --> 01:34:14.842
You got that right.

01:34:17.556 --> 01:34:18.850
Wait, if you're...

01:34:19.226 --> 01:34:20.603
...my...

01:34:24.944 --> 01:34:25.821
Who are you?

01:34:26.238 --> 01:34:29.328
Name's Amanda. Put her there.
I'm with her.

01:34:59.715 --> 01:35:01.301
Well, I guess we're even.

01:35:02.178 --> 01:35:03.264
What do you mean?

01:35:04.766 --> 01:35:06.394
You saved my life.

01:35:06.602 --> 01:35:10.026
Sorry, I didn't want
the wrong girl to go down the aisle.

01:35:10.234 --> 01:35:12.697
I mean, the wrong flower girl.

01:35:12.947 --> 01:35:14.533
You had it right the first time.

01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:18.707
Told you. Third time's a charm.

01:35:19.584 --> 01:35:20.920
Wait a minute.

01:35:21.087 --> 01:35:22.966
All of this was your doing?

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:26.723
It was, was it?

01:35:27.765 --> 01:35:31.147
Well, ladies, what do you have
to say for yourselves?

01:35:33.066 --> 01:35:35.654
So kiss already!

01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:54.731
- Put her there.
- Sister.

01:36:00.617 --> 01:36:04.039
And it's a high flyball...

01:36:04.248 --> 01:36:07.170
...over the left field wall.

01:36:10.259 --> 01:36:11.261
Excuse me.

01:36:11.761 --> 01:36:13.974
This gentleman claims...

01:36:14.141 --> 01:36:16.854
...that the ladies stole his buggy.

01:36:17.898 --> 01:36:19.358
He's right. We did!

01:36:19.567 --> 01:36:21.446
You did go out of your way.

01:36:21.613 --> 01:36:23.115
It was her idea.

01:36:28.041 --> 01:36:31.547
I'd like you to ask
that nice gentleman if he'd sell.

01:36:31.798 --> 01:36:35.304
I don't care how much. That horse
deserves a house in the country.

01:36:37.266 --> 01:36:41.273
I trust we can make
some kind of arrangement.

01:36:43.485 --> 01:36:47.158
Girls, what do you say
we do a little sightseeing?

01:36:47.325 --> 01:36:50.540
And then you girls
can tell us the whole story.

01:36:50.748 --> 01:36:53.420
Driver, once around the park.
If you please.

01:36:53.628 --> 01:36:56.049
It'll be my pleasure, boss.

01:36:57.177 --> 01:36:58.554
Walk on. Duke!
