00:50.120 --> 00:54.319
<i>...what has
turned into a classic Formula 1 season.</i>

00:55.880 --> 00:57.848
<i>With the
weather conditions so uncertain,</i>

00:57.960 --> 00:59.239
<i>the drivers prepare for...</i>

01:01.800 --> 01:03.839
<i>...the track
is still dangerously wet,</i>

01:03.840 --> 01:05.319
<i>but following a drivers' meeting,</i>

01:05.319 --> 01:08.403
<i>- a decision has finally been taken.
- Three minutes to go.</i>

01:09.080 --> 01:11.239
<i>Everybody off the grid now.</i>

01:25.160 --> 01:29.319
<i>Twenty-five drivers
start every season in Formula 1,</i>

01:29.320 --> 01:32.403
<i>and each year two of us die.</i>

01:33.160 --> 01:35.527
<i>What kind of person
does a job like this?</i>

01:36.680 --> 01:38.759
<i>Not normal men, for sure.</i>

01:38.760 --> 01:43.004
<i>Rebels, lunatics, dreamers.</i>

01:43.680 --> 01:46.081
<i>People who are desperate to make a mark</i>

01:46.200 --> 01:48.441
<i>and are prepared to die trying.</i>

01:50.520 --> 01:51.885
<i>My name is Niki Lauda,</i>

01:52.240 --> 01:55.439
<i>and racing people
know me for two things.</i>

01:55.440 --> 01:59.206
<i>The first is my rivalry with him.</i>

02:03.360 --> 02:06.284
<i>Photographers,
please clear the grid.</i>

02:06.800 --> 02:08.768
What about Hunt? Has he changed?

02:09.039 --> 02:10.559
No, he's going on wets.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.759
<i>I don't know
why it became such a big thing.</i>

02:13.760 --> 02:17.128
<i>We were just drivers
busting each other's balls.</i>

02:18.120 --> 02:20.639
<i>To me this is perfectly normal,</i>

02:20.640 --> 02:22.879
<i>but other people saw it differently,</i>

02:22.880 --> 02:25.804
<i>that whatever it was between us
went deeper.</i>

02:42.080 --> 02:44.159
<i>The other thing I'm remembered for</i>

02:44.160 --> 02:47.999
<i>is what happened on 1st August, 1976,</i>

02:48.000 --> 02:49.599
<i>when I was chasing him</i>

02:49.600 --> 02:51.759
<i>like an asshole.</i>

03:22.200 --> 03:23.719
Trauma trolley, please.

03:23.720 --> 03:26.199
Hello, I think the racetrack
telephoned ahead that I was coming.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.645
Hunt. James Hunt.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.803
What's the matter? No one ever seen
a spot of blood before?

03:36.160 --> 03:38.811
- Are you all right?
- Absolutely fine.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.849
We all thought
you'd been in an accident.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.007
I have.

03:45.160 --> 03:48.323
If you call a friendly disagreement
with another driver an accident.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.319
What did you disagree about?

03:56.320 --> 03:57.890
It's none of your business.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.002
Sorry.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.365
His wife.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.999
That's going to need a couple
of stitches. It's a nasty cut.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.083
It was a nasty blow.
Done with a bloody crowbar.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.765
- Why? What did you do?
- Nothing.

04:14.360 --> 04:16.601
Only what she asked me to do.

04:18.839 --> 04:20.365
Which was...

04:21.000 --> 04:23.526
I'd be happy to show you, if you like.

04:26.720 --> 04:29.007
Oh! Sorry.

04:29.120 --> 04:32.920
<i>I have a theory
why women like racing drivers.</i>

04:33.280 --> 04:35.679
<i>It's not because
they respect what we do,</i>

04:35.680 --> 04:38.559
<i>driving round and round in circles.</i>

04:38.560 --> 04:41.131
<i>Mostly they think that's pathetic,
and they're probably right.</i>

04:42.360 --> 04:44.442
<i>It's our closeness to death.</i>

04:45.280 --> 04:49.039
<i>You see, the closer you are to death,
the more alive you feel.</i>

04:49.040 --> 04:52.119
<i>The more alive you are.
And they can see that in you.</i>

04:52.120 --> 04:54.043
<i>They feel that in you.</i>

04:55.200 --> 04:57.441
<i>My name is James Hunt.</i>

04:57.560 --> 04:59.599
<i>My father is a stockbroker,</i>

04:59.600 --> 05:03.207
<i>my sister is a barrister
and my brother is an accountant.</i>

05:04.280 --> 05:05.725
<i>And I...</i>

05:06.240 --> 05:07.890
<i>Well, I do this.</i>

05:09.400 --> 05:10.925
<i>It's a wonderful way to live.</i>

05:11.080 --> 05:13.128
<i>It's the only way to drive.</i>

05:14.080 --> 05:16.481
<i>As if each day is your last.</i>

05:25.760 --> 05:28.319
I've never been to a Grand Prix before.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.239
Oh, you still haven't.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.766
- This is Formula 3.
- What's that?

05:33.600 --> 05:35.919
It's a lower division,

05:35.920 --> 05:38.446
where idiots like me mess about

05:38.840 --> 05:41.599
in the hope of being talent-spotted
to race in Formula 1.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.602
- You look disappointed.
- No.

05:44.080 --> 05:47.359
Ah. You only slept with me
because you thought I was famous.

05:47.360 --> 05:48.930
That's not true.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.679
Don't worry. I will be one day.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.319
Morning, everyone.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.924
- This is Nursie.
- Gemma.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.519
Nursie, this is Bubbles Horsley,
team manager.

05:58.520 --> 05:59.601
How do you do?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.799
- Bubbles?
- Yeah.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.879
- Doc Postlethwaite, our designer.
- How do you do?

06:04.880 --> 06:08.805
And Alexander, Lord Hesketh,
the team's owner.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.330
How do you do?

06:12.160 --> 06:13.679
Fine, thanks.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.639
Well done, Superstar.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.166
- That's the car?
- Yep, that's her.

06:18.280 --> 06:20.009
Lotus 59.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.851
1,000cc Cosworth MAE engine.

06:22.960 --> 06:25.804
She's no beauty,
but goes like the clappers.

06:31.895 --> 06:34.479
Nothing to be worried about.
Does it before every race.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.639
Good sign, actually. Means he's stoked.

06:36.640 --> 06:40.850
<i>All Formula 3 cars
to the assembly area now, please.</i>

06:52.560 --> 06:55.769
<i>...drivers please bring them
to the scrutineering bay now.</i>

06:56.160 --> 06:57.730
All right, Superstar?

06:57.840 --> 06:59.559
Never better, patron.

06:59.560 --> 07:02.040
- Have a gargle with this.
- Thank you.

07:03.520 --> 07:04.931
Quick toke of this.

07:05.840 --> 07:08.730
<i>At Crystal Palace today,
James Hunt's on pole,</i>

07:09.560 --> 07:12.879
<i>with Austrian newcomer
Niki Lauda alongside him</i>

07:12.880 --> 07:15.599
<i>and Dave Walker completing Row 1.</i>

07:15.600 --> 07:18.080
<i>Row 2 is Mike Beuttler and Dave Morgan,</i>

07:18.200 --> 07:21.090
<i>- with Tony Trimmer and Gerry Birrell.</i>
- Who's that?

07:21.440 --> 07:22.965
He's new.

07:23.440 --> 07:26.359
- Some German.
- Austrian.

07:26.360 --> 07:29.519
He's been here since 5:00 am,
walking the track.

07:29.520 --> 07:31.959
You might actually
have to concentrate today, James.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.564
You'll need these.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.879
Okay, start her up.

07:36.880 --> 07:39.399
Ah! What music!

07:39.400 --> 07:40.959
They could never have imagined it,

07:40.960 --> 07:43.247
those pioneers
who invented the automobile,

07:43.360 --> 07:47.570
that it would possess us like this,
in our imaginations, in our dreams.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.607
Nursie, men love women,

07:50.720 --> 07:52.559
but even more than that,

07:52.560 --> 07:55.882
men love cars.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.163
- Come on, James!
- James! Come on, James!

08:07.160 --> 08:08.571
Go, James!

08:16.240 --> 08:17.479
<i>Hunt's still in the lead,</i>

08:17.480 --> 08:19.642
<i>but Niki Lauda is right on his tail.</i>

08:28.295 --> 08:31.319
<i>Hunt and Lauda are
proving to be in a class of their own.</i>

08:31.320 --> 08:32.924
<i>They're leaving the pack far behind.</i>

08:33.320 --> 08:34.924
<i>Herr</i> Red Devil's on his tail.

08:40.894 --> 08:43.119
<i>Lauda takes
a look down the inside...</i>

08:44.680 --> 08:46.444
<i>...and he's sold him a dummy!</i>

08:49.960 --> 08:51.962
<i>Lauda is through! He's in the lead!</i>

08:52.800 --> 08:55.201
<i>Hunt will be determined
to make up for that mistake.</i>

09:01.960 --> 09:03.530
<i>Hunt's in Lauda's slipstream.</i>

09:03.640 --> 09:05.608
<i>Lauda's not leaving any gap.</i>

09:10.720 --> 09:14.725
<i>The Lotus goes for the inside.
It's an aggressive move from Hunt.</i>

09:18.800 --> 09:20.799
<i>Oh! There's contact!</i>

09:27.480 --> 09:30.723
<i>The leaders have spun out!
Lauda's facing the wrong way!</i>

09:31.320 --> 09:33.687
<i>The back marker's gone through.</i>

09:33.894 --> 09:35.719
<i>You can see why Hunt's fellow drivers</i>

09:35.720 --> 09:37.529
<i>call him "Hunt the Shunt".</i>

09:41.000 --> 09:42.079
Asshole!

09:42.080 --> 09:43.844
- Go on, James!
- The Kraut's out of it.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.159
<i>Lauda is clearly furious.</i>

09:46.160 --> 09:49.679
<i>There's every reason
to expect sharp words in the pits.</i>

09:49.680 --> 09:51.569
<i>It's gonna be victory for Hunt.</i>

09:51.680 --> 09:55.039
<i>It's gonna be an ignominious defeat
for Niki Lauda.</i>

09:59.720 --> 10:03.679
<i>So James Hunt scores his
third major Formula 3 win of the season</i>

10:03.680 --> 10:04.920
<i>here at Crystal Palace,</i>

10:05.040 --> 10:07.839
<i>after a desperate battle
with Niki Lauda.</i>

10:07.840 --> 10:09.569
<i>Lauda was unable to restart</i>

10:09.680 --> 10:12.411
<i>after Hunt's aggressive move
caused them both to spin out</i>

10:12.520 --> 10:13.681
<i>in the last lap of the race.</i>

10:15.120 --> 10:16.800
Hard luck.
Better luck next time.

10:17.360 --> 10:18.885
Hey, asshole.

10:19.960 --> 10:22.199
That was my line. I had that corner.

10:22.200 --> 10:25.443
Do you mean the one that you spun out of
and finished facing the other way?

10:25.560 --> 10:27.959
I think that corner had you.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.559
That move was total suicide.
What if I hadn't braked?

10:30.560 --> 10:33.439
- We'd have crashed.
- But we didn't, did we?

10:33.440 --> 10:35.408
Thanks to your impeccable
survival instincts.

10:37.560 --> 10:39.403
Fuck you. What's your name?

10:41.040 --> 10:45.454
James Simon Wallis Hunt.
Remember it, my little Jerry friend.

10:45.455 --> 10:47.439
<i>Jawohl.</i> Remember ze name.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.279
And it's very simple. Hunt.
It rhymes with...

10:50.280 --> 10:51.479
...cunt.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.960
A word that happens
to describe you perfectly!

10:54.560 --> 10:56.079
Who was that?

10:56.080 --> 10:58.319
I've no idea.
He looks like a rat, doesn't he?

11:00.560 --> 11:02.005
<i>In my home town, Vienna,</i>

11:02.440 --> 11:05.762
<i>my family is famous
for one thing - business.</i>

11:06.320 --> 11:08.607
<i>My grandfather was a businessman,</i>

11:09.080 --> 11:10.525
<i>my father, too.</i>

11:11.320 --> 11:14.519
<i>So when they heard I wanted
to race cars for a living,</i>

11:14.520 --> 11:16.329
<i>they had a few things to say.</i>

11:41.440 --> 11:42.805
<i>Gut.</i>

12:03.480 --> 12:05.482
<i>So if my family
wasn't going to help me,</i>

12:05.640 --> 12:09.399
<i>I decided to risk everything
and take out a loan myself.</i>

12:09.400 --> 12:12.370
<i>I found a Formula 1 team
with an okay car</i>

12:12.480 --> 12:14.528
<i>and an owner who had run out of money</i>

12:14.640 --> 12:16.802
<i>and was willing to accept my terms.</i>

12:17.200 --> 12:18.884
And so, ladies and gentlemen,

12:19.000 --> 12:20.839
I'm delighted to say

12:20.840 --> 12:24.367
that the winner of the Guild of Motoring
Writers Award Driver of the Year...

12:25.560 --> 12:26.561
is James Hunt.

12:30.480 --> 12:31.925
Superb news!

12:32.680 --> 12:34.842
- Well done, James.
- Superstar!

12:35.000 --> 12:36.445
Fantastic!

12:37.935 --> 12:40.359
Well done. Congratulations.
Thank you so much.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.519
Yes!

12:41.520 --> 12:42.879
Erm...

12:42.880 --> 12:45.690
You know, my parents
always wanted me to be a doctor...

12:45.840 --> 12:47.999
...or a stockbroker or something.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.759
They gave me the first-class education,

12:49.760 --> 12:51.919
but, well, that all went terribly wrong

12:51.920 --> 12:53.800
and I ended up with you lot.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.359
Thank you. I need it more than you do.

13:00.400 --> 13:04.086
I mean, I have a hot head,
an inability to tolerate discipline.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.565
- Yes!
- Very true.

13:06.280 --> 13:08.123
I fall out with people left and right.

13:08.760 --> 13:11.879
The only creatures I've ever really
loved or have treated honourably

13:11.880 --> 13:13.882
are budgerigars.

13:15.200 --> 13:19.205
So in any normal area of life I'd be...
or I am, a total liability.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.880
The only thing I've got going for me
is I'm quick in a car.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.039
So, thank you for this
and for acknowledging that.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.559
I'm going to give it to my father

13:25.560 --> 13:27.399
and tell him to put it
on the mantelpiece

13:27.400 --> 13:29.799
and imagine it's a first-class degree
in medicine.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.959
Well done, Superstar.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.566
Another season like that
and I'll move you up to the big time.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.319
Come on, you don't think I'm ready now?

13:51.320 --> 13:54.688
You are. I'm not.
I've got to find you a car first.

13:54.840 --> 13:57.239
Well, go on, then. Chop-chop.

13:57.240 --> 13:59.599
Don't wait too long. You don't want him
to do what Lauda just did.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.639
- Why? What did he do?
- Got himself a drive with BRM.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.919
Well, how the hell did he do that?
He's a nobody.

14:04.920 --> 14:06.439
He's never won a bloody thing.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.439
Apparently, took out a loan
and bought his way in

14:08.440 --> 14:10.159
with two million Austrian schillings.

14:10.160 --> 14:11.605
Jesus.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.169
Niki Lauda.
Here for pre-season testing. BRM?

14:35.680 --> 14:38.490
Sign the release form.
I'll let them know you're here.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.799
- Mr Stanley.
- Good morning.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.799
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Clay!

14:54.800 --> 14:57.559
Let me introduce you
to our number-one driver,

14:57.560 --> 14:59.562
Clay Regazzoni.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.689
- How are you?
- Good.

15:03.440 --> 15:06.444
- Pleasure.
- And these are your mechanics.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.519
They're reporting exclusively to you,
as per contract.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.359
Pleasure. Do you wanna see the car?

15:13.360 --> 15:14.805
Sure.

15:16.840 --> 15:18.251
Hello.

15:23.280 --> 15:25.726
There she is. P160.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.126
- Same as Regazzoni's?
- Identical in every detail.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.570
How much does she weigh?

15:31.720 --> 15:34.326
- 600 kilos.
- But that's crazy.

15:34.520 --> 15:37.199
- Why so heavy?
- It's a V12 engine.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.399
That lump weighs 190K on its own.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.399
Okay.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.759
What horsepower are you getting? 490?

15:44.760 --> 15:47.239
- No, no, 450.
- Well, it's not enough.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.719
It needs to be 500,

15:48.720 --> 15:50.479
and the engine
needs to be 20 kilo lighter.

15:50.480 --> 15:51.799
We already tried.

15:51.800 --> 15:52.961
- Tried what?
- Everything.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.719
We replaced the entire exhaust system.

15:54.720 --> 15:58.008
- Barely made a difference.
- Are you using magnesium parts?

16:11.040 --> 16:12.559
Now the engine block.

16:12.560 --> 16:15.291
Any mounting or fixing plates,
strip it out also.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.759
When you've done that,
we have to look at the aerodynamics,

16:18.760 --> 16:20.524
front and rear wing.

16:37.960 --> 16:40.042
Okay, thank you. Good night.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.445
What was Regazzoni's time?

17:03.320 --> 17:04.731
1:53.

17:05.079 --> 17:07.999
Okay, now put him in my car,
and he'll go round two seconds faster.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.049
- Well, that's impossible.
- No chance.

17:14.079 --> 17:16.439
We've been
working on it all night.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.559
Put Regazzoni in the car.
See what happens.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.479
I don't understand.
Why am I supposed to do this?

17:20.480 --> 17:22.839
I don't know, Clay.
He just wants you to take it for a spin.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.279
Gloves, please.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.725
<i>'fanculo.</i>

18:11.920 --> 18:15.039
- I would say we push it a bit...
- All right.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.119
What did you do to the car?

18:17.120 --> 18:20.647
That's information I will share with you
under certain conditions only.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.325
Go on.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.084
A guaranteed place in the team,

18:25.440 --> 18:27.960
and a paid contract on equal terms
with Regazzoni for two years.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.804
Are you crazy?

18:30.920 --> 18:34.447
Clay's a senior figure in Formula 1.
You're just a rookie.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.360
Well, the only reason we took you on
is because you're paying us.

18:37.640 --> 18:40.959
Well, as of now, if you want me to stay,
we rip up the contract.

18:40.960 --> 18:43.691
- I don't pay you a cent.
- That's outrageous!

18:44.200 --> 18:46.282
Was he quicker in my car?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.002
He was, wasn't he?

18:49.720 --> 18:51.961
Did he go two seconds faster?

18:55.600 --> 18:57.045
2.3.

18:59.760 --> 19:01.888
So, have a think,

19:02.520 --> 19:04.761
work out your priorities
and get back to me.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.171
Hey, Niki.

19:23.560 --> 19:26.450
I know what you're going to say,
that it's none of my business.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.561
What?

19:28.960 --> 19:32.282
If it's the track manager
you're taking on your date tonight...

19:33.320 --> 19:34.959
It's none of your business.

19:34.960 --> 19:38.726
Okay, but if you want my advice,
I'd let this one go.

19:40.080 --> 19:43.721
I'm not questioning your taste.
She is a great girl, but...

19:45.360 --> 19:49.319
Agnes's last boyfriend
was a British Formula 2 driver

19:49.320 --> 19:51.719
who has a reputation for two things.

19:51.720 --> 19:54.405
For being a little crazy on the track,

19:54.560 --> 19:58.724
and for going all night and all day
and all night again in bed.

19:58.840 --> 20:02.359
He's a good driver,
but an immortal fuck, apparently.

20:02.360 --> 20:05.399
I don't know about you, but
that's not an act I'd like to follow.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.722
But if that doesn't bother you...

20:12.640 --> 20:15.610
What's his name, the driver?

20:15.840 --> 20:17.365
Hunt. James Hunt.

20:21.480 --> 20:24.927
You see, you share information
and I share information.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.487
That's what teammates are for.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.279
<i>Where the hell are we going?</i>

20:40.280 --> 20:42.639
<i>I promise it'll be worth it.</i>

20:42.640 --> 20:44.085
<i>Just keep them closed.</i>

20:44.520 --> 20:45.965
Wait for it.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.609
Wait for it.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.406
There. What do you say?

20:54.520 --> 20:56.090
She's Formula 1.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.204
Yes, she is, Superstar.

20:58.640 --> 21:01.519
Your brother and I got together
with the bean counters.

21:01.520 --> 21:02.999
And since the economics of F1

21:03.000 --> 21:06.639
are not so significantly different
to the economics of Formula 2,

21:06.640 --> 21:09.041
well, we thought if we were
going to be losing money,

21:09.160 --> 21:12.279
we might as well be doing it on
the big roulette table in Formula 1.

21:12.280 --> 21:15.602
You fat, little, inbred beauty.
Come here.

21:19.920 --> 21:23.242
Actually, credit where it's due,
we got the idea from Niki.

21:23.520 --> 21:25.519
- Who?
- Lauda.

21:25.520 --> 21:28.359
Bought his way in, rather than
mess about in the lower divisions.

21:28.360 --> 21:29.930
I thought, "Bloody hell, he's right."

21:30.160 --> 21:33.639
No sponsorship, Superstar.
I hope you approve.

21:33.640 --> 21:37.645
No vulgar logos
for cigarettes or condoms.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.248
Just plain white with the flags. Ooh!

21:40.680 --> 21:43.650
And racing overalls which read,

21:44.840 --> 21:47.439
"Sex. Breakfast of champions."

21:50.120 --> 21:51.929
So, when do we start?

21:52.880 --> 21:55.087
- Soon as you're ready.
- Ready?

21:55.400 --> 21:57.971
I've been waiting for this
my whole life.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.999
- Hi, welcome to Watkins Glen.
- Hello!

22:09.000 --> 22:10.764
<i>When the season started,
people wondered</i>

22:11.080 --> 22:13.890
<i>whether Lord Hesketh and his team
of upper-class enthusiasts</i>

22:14.240 --> 22:18.719
<i>were bringing glamour
to the racing community, or just comedy.</i>

22:18.720 --> 22:20.879
Certainly, it was the first time
anyone had seen

22:20.880 --> 22:24.519
a butler serving oysters and caviar
in the pits.

22:24.520 --> 22:27.359
But they have made quite an impact.

22:27.360 --> 22:30.599
Sixth in France, fourth in Britain
and third in Holland.

22:30.600 --> 22:34.279
<i>All drivers on the track,
caution flags are out.</i>

22:34.280 --> 22:36.454
<i>A severe crash at the Esses.</i>

22:36.455 --> 22:38.559
<i>Red flag.
There is a car off the track.</i>

22:38.560 --> 22:40.319
And reports are reaching me

22:40.320 --> 22:42.527
that there has been
a serious accident in qualifying.

22:42.734 --> 22:45.479
Er, the identity of the driver we don't
currently have at the moment,

22:45.480 --> 22:47.687
but, as you can tell
from all the activity

22:47.800 --> 22:49.479
going on behind me towards the track,

22:49.480 --> 22:51.959
it is clearly a grave incident indeed.

22:51.960 --> 22:53.439
We will, of course,
have more information for you

22:53.440 --> 22:54.487
as and when we get it,

22:54.600 --> 22:58.605
but it is the sight and sound
of Formula 1 nobody likes to see.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.364
- Get your hands off me.
- Hey, come on.

23:14.295 --> 23:15.959
<i>Drivers of top stature</i>

23:15.960 --> 23:17.759
<i>we've lost just in the past four seasons</i>

23:17.760 --> 23:22.679
<i>have included Piers Courage,
Jochen Rindt,</i>

23:22.680 --> 23:26.039
<i>Jo Siffert, Roger Williamson</i>

23:26.040 --> 23:28.319
<i>and today, at Watkins Glen,</i>

23:28.320 --> 23:30.641
<i>Formula 1 has claimed another driver.</i>

23:31.240 --> 23:33.527
<i>The Tyrrell team
have withdrawn from the race.</i>

23:33.640 --> 23:36.359
<i>Their places on the grid
will be left empty.</i>

23:36.360 --> 23:38.806
- Terrible.
- They should cancel the race.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.565
Why?

23:40.880 --> 23:43.326
He made a mistake,
went into the corner too fast.

23:43.440 --> 23:44.919
It's his fault.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.809
- Is that right?
- It's obvious.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.929
Look at the tyre marks.

23:49.320 --> 23:52.639
So says the nobody
who had to pay for his own drive.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.320
How's that working out for you,
by the way?

23:54.520 --> 23:57.330
Fine. How is it at the back?

23:58.240 --> 24:00.322
Not planning on being there for long.

24:01.095 --> 24:02.799
<i>Ten minutes to the warm-up lap.</i>

24:02.800 --> 24:04.319
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

24:07.640 --> 24:09.005
Arsehole.

24:10.400 --> 24:13.759
<i>Heading into
the Grand Hotel hairpin, second gear.</i>

24:13.760 --> 24:14.839
Turn in hard,

24:14.840 --> 24:17.491
looking for late apex,
gentle with the bar.

24:19.240 --> 24:22.369
Heading into Portier, second gear,
clip the apex,

24:22.480 --> 24:26.041
light brake, stay in second,
looking for a good exit.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.519
Heading through the tunnel,
gradual right,

24:28.520 --> 24:31.559
up through third, fourth, fifth...

24:31.560 --> 24:33.562
Is Alexander round?

24:34.080 --> 24:36.759
Er, yes, he was.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.439
He went back to the house
to take a call.

24:38.440 --> 24:40.279
He'll be back shortly.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.442
He only wanted to show me
his pride and joy.

24:43.400 --> 24:46.199
Rhymes with "boy", if you ask me.

24:46.200 --> 24:48.079
And "toy".

24:48.080 --> 24:52.359
God, it's so flimsy
for something that costs so much.

24:52.360 --> 24:56.439
There's no comfort,
no protection, nothing.

24:56.440 --> 24:59.159
No, it's just a little coffin, really.

24:59.160 --> 25:02.279
Surrounded by high-octane fuel in here.

25:02.280 --> 25:05.279
Being driven round 170 miles per hour.

25:05.280 --> 25:08.443
To all intents and purposes,
this thing's a bomb on wheels.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.523
You're James, aren't you?

25:12.760 --> 25:14.250
Yes.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.929
You fit the description.

25:17.320 --> 25:18.731
Is that right?

25:19.960 --> 25:21.928
Suzy. Friend of Alex's.

25:22.040 --> 25:25.169
Yeah, yeah. I know exactly.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.399
What was the description?

25:28.400 --> 25:29.999
Mostly positive,
in terms of appearance.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.207
Negative only in terms of character.

25:32.720 --> 25:34.643
I've been told to avoid you.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.451
By whom?

25:36.880 --> 25:39.799
Alexander. He says you're a bad boy.

25:39.800 --> 25:42.159
Alexander doesn't know
what he's talking about.

25:42.160 --> 25:44.599
I was. I'm not any more.

25:44.600 --> 25:48.199
The new me is very professional.
Early to bed, early to rise.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.839
- All very dull.
- Hmm.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.279
But according to the team,

25:51.280 --> 25:53.961
"The best way to
keep beating the goose-stepper."

25:54.655 --> 25:56.359
Is that what you were doing
when I came in?

25:56.360 --> 25:59.399
Yes, visualisation techniques,
memorising the circuit,

25:59.400 --> 26:02.085
in this case Monaco, which is up next.

26:06.880 --> 26:10.119
Personally, I've always been a great
believer in getting there on the day,

26:10.120 --> 26:12.679
putting my foot down
and playing chicken with everyone else.

26:14.735 --> 26:16.439
But they don't want me
doing that any more.

26:16.440 --> 26:20.525
They want my body like a temple
and my mind like a monk.

26:21.200 --> 26:24.399
And what about your soul, your heart?

26:24.400 --> 26:26.639
Well, they've got ideas about that, too.

26:26.640 --> 26:29.239
They want me to stop messing around,
settle down,

26:29.240 --> 26:31.559
get married
with the next nice girl I meet.

26:31.560 --> 26:32.971
They think it would be good for me.

26:33.440 --> 26:35.442
Hmm. What do you think?

26:35.800 --> 26:39.122
It sounds fucking awful.

26:40.240 --> 26:42.607
But since they're right
about most things,

26:42.880 --> 26:45.599
- they're probably right about that, too.
- Hmm.

26:45.600 --> 26:48.001
You don't fancy getting married, do you?

27:13.400 --> 27:14.925
Suzy.

27:15.640 --> 27:17.051
Bravo!

27:17.400 --> 27:19.323
Hey, hey, hey!

27:22.880 --> 27:24.803
- What's going on with him?
- Nothing. Nothing.

27:25.160 --> 27:26.571
Didn't want to ruin your day.

27:27.160 --> 27:29.561
It's... It's the Kraut.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.410
What about him?

27:32.280 --> 27:34.199
He's just been signed by Ferrari.

27:34.200 --> 27:37.921
You're kidding me?
Jesus. How did that happen?

27:38.200 --> 27:39.690
Did he buy his way in there, too?

27:39.800 --> 27:45.439
Well, the old man took Regazzoni back
and he insisted on it, apparently.

27:45.440 --> 27:47.408
He says that Niki's a genius
setting up the cars.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.484
It's terrible. Drives like a pig.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.687
- Oh, you can't say that.
- Why not?

28:12.040 --> 28:14.088
- It's a Ferrari!
- It's a shitbox.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.999
It understeers like crazy and
the weight distribution is a disaster.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.049
It's amazing, all these facilities
and you make a piece of crap like this.

28:22.440 --> 28:23.879
Uh!

28:52.520 --> 28:55.759
"Ferrari family."
"Our good friend Clay Regazzoni."

28:55.760 --> 28:59.319
You are family and friend
to the commendatore as long as you win.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.731
The minute you don't, ciao, ciao.

29:01.040 --> 29:05.170
I totally understand. It's business.
I would do the same.

29:05.280 --> 29:08.279
But it isn't
just business, is it? What we do.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.439
It's passion, love.

29:10.440 --> 29:13.279
Which is why we are prepared
to risk our lives for it.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.399
Not me.

29:14.400 --> 29:17.121
If I had more talent and could earn
better money with something else,

29:17.280 --> 29:18.959
I would.

29:18.960 --> 29:22.639
How do you know you will
make money here? You haven't yet.

29:22.640 --> 29:24.961
Not yet, but I will.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.529
If you can, I can.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.243
You know, are you ever not an asshole?

29:34.600 --> 29:36.639
- Why am I an asshole?
- Well...

29:36.640 --> 29:38.239
You know, by now
I'm both quicker than you

29:38.240 --> 29:40.159
and better at setting up the car.

29:40.160 --> 29:41.999
You can't deal with it,
so you're the asshole.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.161
Screw you.

29:51.080 --> 29:54.359
I brought you along today because
you seem like a lonely kind of guy.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.319
I thought if I introduced you
to some nice people,

29:56.320 --> 29:58.199
that could rub off on you.

29:58.200 --> 30:00.919
Forget it. Make your own friends.

30:00.920 --> 30:03.605
Come on, Clay. I'm sorry.

30:39.120 --> 30:40.565
Are you leaving?

30:41.680 --> 30:43.091
Yes.

30:43.560 --> 30:45.319
Can you give me a lift
to the nearest town,

30:45.320 --> 30:46.765
anywhere with a train station?

30:48.560 --> 30:51.643
Sure. Trento's half an hour's drive.

30:52.280 --> 30:53.327
Get in.

31:04.680 --> 31:08.127
♬ Been another blue day
without you, girl

31:09.240 --> 31:12.767
♬ Been another sad summer song

31:14.520 --> 31:18.525
♬ I been thinking about you, girl,
all night long

31:20.480 --> 31:21.561
What are you doing?

31:21.960 --> 31:23.561
You hear that noise when you accelerate?

31:23.960 --> 31:26.247
- No.
- Your fan belt is loose.

31:26.360 --> 31:28.119
My What?

31:28.120 --> 31:30.599
And when you brake,
your foot goes all the way down,

31:30.600 --> 31:32.120
which means there's air in the system.

31:32.360 --> 31:34.931
- Anything else?
- No.

31:35.920 --> 31:38.685
Apart from
the rear brakes are worn out,

31:39.000 --> 31:40.479
the front right tyre's a bit soft,

31:40.480 --> 31:42.279
which explains
why you're weaving so much.

31:42.280 --> 31:44.760
Hmm. How can you tell?

31:45.120 --> 31:47.088
- My ass.
- Sorry?

31:47.240 --> 31:49.199
God gave me an okay mind,

31:49.200 --> 31:51.931
but a really good ass,
which can feel everything in a car.

31:52.215 --> 31:54.559
You don't know what
you're talking about. This car is fine.

31:54.560 --> 31:57.359
- I just had a service a week ago.
- Not a good one.

31:57.360 --> 32:00.011
Yes, a very good one, very expensive.

32:00.560 --> 32:02.719
This car is as good as new. Relax.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.559
Not in a hurry, are you?

32:11.560 --> 32:13.319
No. As long as I'm back

32:13.320 --> 32:14.651
in Maranello Monday morning.

32:17.080 --> 32:18.399
<i>Ja.</i>

32:18.400 --> 32:20.562
- Marlene.
- Niki.

33:27.280 --> 33:29.851
<i>Mi scusi... Tu sei Niki Lauda?</i>

33:30.960 --> 33:32.999
Yes.

33:41.840 --> 33:43.319
- Actually, we do, yeah.
- Okay.

33:43.320 --> 33:44.599
It's my honour, Niki, please.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.841
- Thank you.
- My car is your car.

33:46.960 --> 33:50.759
On one condition, though.
It's a piece of shit. It's dog shit.

33:50.760 --> 33:53.843
But if you drive it,
you make my life, Niki, eh?

34:06.680 --> 34:08.808
- Niki Lauda!
- Niki Lauda, Niki Lauda!

34:10.719 --> 34:13.119
Will someone please tell me
what's going on?

34:13.120 --> 34:14.639
Who are you? Should I know you?

34:14.639 --> 34:16.130
What, you don't know?

34:16.719 --> 34:20.719
He's Niki Lauda, Formula 1 driver,
and he just signed with Ferrari.

34:20.719 --> 34:22.210
- Him?
- Yes.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.527
- Impossible.
- Why?

34:24.639 --> 34:29.199
Well, you know, Formula 1 drivers,
they have long hair, are sexy,

34:29.199 --> 34:30.719
their shirts are open to here.

34:30.719 --> 34:32.478
- Thank you.
- Yes.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.882
Anyway, look at the way he's driving,
like an old man.

34:40.159 --> 34:41.639
There's no need to drive fast.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.922
It just increases
the percentage of risk.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.481
We're not in a hurry.
I'm not being paid.

34:47.080 --> 34:49.918
Right now,
with zero incentive or reward,

34:49.920 --> 34:51.684
why would I drive fast?

34:53.520 --> 34:55.522
Because I'm asking you to.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.371
<i>Ja.</i>

35:59.400 --> 36:01.079
<i>This is an incredible battle</i>

36:01.080 --> 36:03.559
<i>between Niki Lauda in the red Ferrari</i>

36:03.560 --> 36:06.086
<i>and James Hunt in the white Hesketh.</i>

36:07.200 --> 36:08.759
...the challenge of Niki Lauda...

36:08.760 --> 36:10.279
<i>Lauda attacking Hunt.</i>

36:10.280 --> 36:12.089
<i>Lauda gets through on the inside.</i>

36:12.200 --> 36:13.725
<i>Goes wide at the exit.</i>

36:13.920 --> 36:15.439
<i>Hunt is past again.</i>

36:15.440 --> 36:18.599
<i>Once more
Lauda tries to sneak up the inside.</i>

36:18.600 --> 36:22.679
<i>They're absolutely side by side,
wheel to wheel.</i>

36:22.680 --> 36:26.759
<i>So evenly matched. Fantastic battle
between these two great drivers.</i>

36:26.760 --> 36:29.127
<i>Hunt is now ahead once more.</i>

36:30.600 --> 36:35.279
<i>But Lauda's coming back again now.
Lauda once more sneaks up the inside.</i>

36:35.280 --> 36:37.760
<i>And again he runs wide.
Again the Hesketh...</i>

36:37.920 --> 36:41.083
- Suzy, we're ready, come on.
- Just... Just one second.

36:41.960 --> 36:44.611
- Can we go, yeah?
- Okay, yeah.

36:45.360 --> 36:48.199
<i>We're in the closing laps
of this race here at Watkins Glen.</i>

36:48.200 --> 36:49.201
<i>They come down the hill.</i>

36:50.920 --> 36:52.639
<i>And Hunt's got a problem!</i>

36:52.640 --> 36:55.119
<i>Hunt pulls across to the left.</i>

36:55.120 --> 36:57.964
<i>Lauda goes ahead on his own.</i>

36:59.640 --> 37:02.120
<i>A sad end to a wonderful battle.</i>

37:02.240 --> 37:04.811
<i>Hunt pushing off the marshal.</i>

37:13.240 --> 37:17.325
<i>The chequered flag
is waiting for Lauda and for Ferrari.</i>

37:18.760 --> 37:21.479
<i>The title going to Niki Lauda,</i>

37:21.480 --> 37:22.999
<i>who wins the race,</i>

37:23.000 --> 37:25.480
<i>who wins the World Championship.</i>

38:07.320 --> 38:10.290
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

38:11.040 --> 38:12.559
Marlene.

38:14.080 --> 38:17.919
With a car like that, the rest of us
never really stood a chance, did we?

38:17.920 --> 38:20.890
Maybe the fact the car is so good
has something to do with me.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.890
Come on, Niki. You're in a Ferrari.
I'm in a Hesketh.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.959
Equal terms,
the way it was in Formula 3,

38:25.960 --> 38:28.406
- I'd beat you and you know it.
- Never.

38:28.520 --> 38:31.410
You might win one race, maybe two,
because you're aggressive.

38:31.640 --> 38:34.723
But in the long run, over the course
of a season, no chance.

38:34.840 --> 38:35.887
Right. Why's that?

38:36.160 --> 38:38.891
Because to be a champion,
it takes more than just being quick.

38:39.040 --> 38:40.799
- It's the whole picture.
- Oh.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.839
You're just a charger and a party guy.

38:42.840 --> 38:44.080
That's why everybody likes you.

38:44.680 --> 38:46.759
Try saying that
and tell me you're not jealous.

38:48.040 --> 38:50.725
Why would I be jealous? Think about it.

38:51.080 --> 38:53.239
All that affection, all those smiles

38:53.240 --> 38:55.079
- is a sign of disrespect.
- Oh.

38:55.080 --> 38:57.599
They don't fear you.
Whereas compare that to me.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.251
Yes, compared to you, whom no one likes.

39:00.360 --> 39:01.999
- Right.
- Not even his own teammates.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.765
Right. Because I'm a serious guy.

39:04.880 --> 39:07.281
I go to bed early,
I look after myself, look after my car.

39:07.400 --> 39:10.449
- Yes, you're very well-behaved.
- Go to work, kick ass.

39:10.560 --> 39:13.291
And then, after the race,
I go home instead of going to bars

39:13.400 --> 39:16.599
and talk all this bullshit
with all these assholes.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.519
Arseholes?

39:18.520 --> 39:20.966
You should go home more often, too.

39:24.280 --> 39:26.282
I heard you got married.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.884
Yes, I did.

39:30.440 --> 39:33.046
So where is she, this mysterious wife?

39:34.240 --> 39:36.242
- In New York, working.
- Oh.

39:37.640 --> 39:39.639
You know,
I've never seen you with her once.

39:39.640 --> 39:40.880
No?

39:43.240 --> 39:46.199
Well, maybe that's because
you're always at home,

39:46.200 --> 39:50.125
on your own, looking after yourself,
being a good little boy.

39:54.320 --> 39:55.651
Take a drink on me, James.

39:57.560 --> 40:00.166
Thank you, Niki. I might just have two.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.039
Right, Bubbles,

40:13.040 --> 40:16.169
whatever it takes to beat
that prick next year, just say it.

40:16.280 --> 40:17.691
Your word is my command.

40:17.800 --> 40:21.282
There are no lengths
to which I will not go. I mean it.

40:23.840 --> 40:25.683
What the hell's going on?

40:27.840 --> 40:30.446
Where is everybody? What's the matter?

40:36.040 --> 40:38.599
Do you know what the date is today?

40:38.600 --> 40:41.046
Yes, it's November, the 14th. Why?

40:41.480 --> 40:45.724
Do you have any idea
of the significance of that date?

40:47.040 --> 40:50.203
I don't know.
Time to start killing pheasants?

40:52.520 --> 40:55.359
Actually, it's the deadline
for securing sponsorship

40:55.360 --> 40:57.283
for the forthcoming Formula 1 season.

40:57.520 --> 40:58.965
Yes?

40:59.160 --> 41:02.130
Which elapsed at midnight last night,
and we didn't attract any.

41:02.520 --> 41:06.159
Well, so?
We aren't looking for sponsorship.

41:06.160 --> 41:08.447
Like you said, condoms and cigarettes,
vulgar, right?

41:10.400 --> 41:11.606
Right.

41:13.160 --> 41:15.527
Except we are, or were.

41:18.320 --> 41:20.766
I've made something of a miscalculation.

41:21.720 --> 41:25.202
The economics, Formula 1,
realities thereof.

41:26.600 --> 41:29.763
It turns out,
not like the lower divisions at all.

41:32.280 --> 41:34.009
What are you saying?

41:35.920 --> 41:38.400
I'm saying it's over, Superstar.

41:39.240 --> 41:42.767
The banks have stepped in,
started laying everyone off.

41:44.560 --> 41:46.961
Probably have to sell this place.

41:47.560 --> 41:49.562
Oh, Christ.

42:30.200 --> 42:33.966
I need a drive, Pete.
I need you to find me a drive.

42:34.400 --> 42:35.925
I mean, what about Lotus?

42:37.040 --> 42:38.485
You don't wanna know.

42:38.720 --> 42:41.451
- Actually, I do.
<i>- Okay. Uh...</i>

42:43.800 --> 42:45.802
They felt your reputation preceded you.

42:46.120 --> 42:47.879
And what does that mean?

42:49.440 --> 42:52.489
It's my other line.
Look, I'll get back to you.

42:54.400 --> 42:55.481
Peter Hunt.

42:55.840 --> 42:57.410
Fuck.

43:08.240 --> 43:09.685
Don't worry. Something will turn up.

43:18.480 --> 43:20.528
Doubt that will help in the meantime.

43:23.480 --> 43:26.199
Why don't we go away at the weekend?

43:26.200 --> 43:29.329
Skiing. Before I go back to New York.

43:32.960 --> 43:36.362
Talk to me, James.
Don't make a stranger of me.

43:36.480 --> 43:40.519
You know, Suzy,
only a stranger would invite me skiing

43:40.520 --> 43:42.966
when they know
I haven't got a fucking drive.

43:49.360 --> 43:51.124
I can't watch this.

43:51.880 --> 43:54.201
What were you hoping for anyway?

43:54.680 --> 43:57.039
A well-adjusted knight
in shining armour?

43:57.040 --> 43:59.039
No danger of that.

43:59.040 --> 44:01.399
- Let me give you some advice.
- I'm all ears.

44:01.400 --> 44:04.239
Don't go to men who are willing
to kill themselves driving in circles

44:04.240 --> 44:06.891
- looking for normality.
- I never expected normality.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.159
God knows I walked into this
with my eyes open.

44:09.160 --> 44:10.719
I just hoped I'd married someone

44:10.720 --> 44:13.803
who was half as impressive
on the inside as he is on the outside.

44:13.920 --> 44:15.719
At least there's something
behind the facade.

44:15.720 --> 44:17.927
- Oh, James.
- Fuck off to New York, dear.

44:19.080 --> 44:21.479
There must be a moisturiser
or an eye shadow somewhere

44:21.480 --> 44:23.244
that needs your vapid mush to flog it.

44:59.960 --> 45:01.439
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, James.</i>

45:01.440 --> 45:04.762
It's Peter. Something's up at McLaren.

45:05.360 --> 45:07.439
<i>- What have you heard?</i>
- Nothing. Why?

45:07.440 --> 45:09.966
I heard Emerson's off.
He's dumped them in it.

45:10.640 --> 45:12.799
Jesus. Get me in there, Pete.

45:12.800 --> 45:15.201
Say anything, just get me in that room.

45:20.120 --> 45:21.959
I'll come straight to the point.

45:21.960 --> 45:25.479
- Our esteemed lead driver...
- Fitti-fucking-paldi.

45:25.480 --> 45:27.799
...has ditched us for another team
at the last minute.

45:27.800 --> 45:30.159
- Coper-fucking-sucar.
- And we need a replacement.

45:30.160 --> 45:31.650
ASA-fucking-P.

45:32.640 --> 45:36.486
Fortunately, a few hands
have already gone up, good people.

45:37.320 --> 45:40.005
- Jacky Ickx.
- I'm quicker than Jacky.

45:40.440 --> 45:44.399
- But he's consistent, dependable.
- A grown-up.

45:44.400 --> 45:47.847
Right, and will he go for that gap
when no one else will?

45:47.960 --> 45:49.928
Will he put his life on the line
the day that it really matters?

45:50.240 --> 45:51.685
The sponsors like him.

45:52.160 --> 45:54.399
What do you want,
a driver or a brush salesman?

45:54.400 --> 45:56.320
- We wanna be successful.
- Yes, so do I.

45:56.600 --> 45:59.599
But that means beating Niki Lauda,
not being a show pony for sponsors.

45:59.600 --> 46:01.159
I heard about this thing with Niki.

46:01.160 --> 46:02.366
Everyone has.

46:03.495 --> 46:06.079
- You really think you can beat him?
- I'd beat him in a McLaren.

46:06.080 --> 46:09.368
It's the only car out there
as quick as the Ferrari.

46:09.680 --> 46:11.682
Which is why I'm here, begging.

46:12.160 --> 46:13.679
Look, I'll do whatever you ask.

46:13.680 --> 46:15.523
I'll put on a tie,
I'll smile for sponsors,

46:15.640 --> 46:17.529
say the right things.

46:17.840 --> 46:20.161
I can beat this guy, trust me.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.889
Just give me the drive.

46:23.600 --> 46:25.489
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, he can be a loose cannon.</i>

46:25.680 --> 46:27.359
And, yeah, he will drive you all mad,

46:27.360 --> 46:30.887
but in terms of raw talent
and right stuff,

46:31.000 --> 46:32.889
there is no better driver in the world.

46:33.280 --> 46:35.442
<i>He's the real thing, Teddy.</i>

46:35.560 --> 46:38.094
<i>- He's what we all came into this for.</i>
- Mmm.

46:38.095 --> 46:40.199
Nine days out of ten
you'll be pulling your hair out,

46:40.200 --> 46:43.399
but on that tenth day,
James will be unbeatable.

46:43.400 --> 46:45.402
And that is the day you will wish
you had him in your car.

46:45.680 --> 46:48.524
<i>You will never win the championship
with Jacky Ickx.</i>

46:48.880 --> 46:51.319
You just might with James.

47:13.375 --> 47:15.879
Welcome to São Paulo, Brazil,
and the Interlagos circuit

47:15.880 --> 47:19.521
for the first race
in the 1976 Formula 1 season,

47:19.760 --> 47:22.999
where the main news is that James Hunt
has qualified fastest,

47:23.000 --> 47:25.082
beating Niki Lauda's Ferrari
to pole position

47:25.200 --> 47:27.931
by just two hundredths of a second.

47:28.920 --> 47:30.524
New car.

47:31.360 --> 47:33.010
- I noticed.
- Pole position.

47:34.040 --> 47:35.439
I noticed that, too.

47:35.440 --> 47:37.919
Level playing field now,
my ratty little friend.

47:37.920 --> 47:41.599
Yeah. Let's see where we are
after lap one.

47:41.600 --> 47:44.410
Let's see where we are
in five races' time.

47:45.240 --> 47:47.439
Hunt has the pit lane pole position,

47:47.440 --> 47:50.250
which should give him the best chance
of out dragging Lauda's Ferrari.

47:51.280 --> 47:52.959
If ever there was a doubt about

47:52.960 --> 47:56.279
whether Lauda had
a serious challenger to this season,

47:56.280 --> 47:59.921
Hunt and his McLaren
have certainly given us the answer.

48:15.600 --> 48:17.159
<i>Here in South Africa,</i>

48:17.160 --> 48:19.162
<i>James Hunt is determined to make amends</i>

48:19.280 --> 48:22.284
<i>after that disastrous retirement
in Brazil.</i>

48:23.280 --> 48:26.839
<i>But it's Lauda who takes the flag
here at Kyalami.</i>

48:26.840 --> 48:28.559
<i>James Hunt comes home second</i>

48:28.560 --> 48:31.079
<i>to confirm his championship
challenge at last</i>

48:31.080 --> 48:32.839
<i>and score his first points</i>

48:32.840 --> 48:34.410
<i>of the season.</i>

48:35.000 --> 48:38.846
That wind you can feel
is me breathing down your neck.

48:38.960 --> 48:40.962
Next time I'll have you.

48:41.920 --> 48:43.331
We'll see in Spain.

49:03.840 --> 49:07.679
<i>James Hunt finally takes
his first victory of the season</i>

49:07.680 --> 49:10.206
<i>here in Spain, after a brilliant drive.</i>

49:10.320 --> 49:12.527
It was only a matter of time.

49:19.720 --> 49:22.690
Luca, don't you think it's time
to tell them?

49:29.400 --> 49:31.721
- It's too wide.
- Disqualified.

49:32.120 --> 49:34.559
- What?
- You're disqualified.

49:34.560 --> 49:36.244
How can we be disqualified?

49:36.360 --> 49:38.239
- 1.5 centimetres.
- It's the same car.

49:38.240 --> 49:40.402
<i>Giustissimo.</i>

49:44.560 --> 49:45.721
You fucking...

49:45.840 --> 49:48.719
<i>...McLaren M23
has proved very controversial here.</i>

49:50.720 --> 49:52.563
Just make it narrower. I don't care how.

49:52.680 --> 49:54.759
New rear suspension.
New wishbones.

49:54.760 --> 49:57.570
I wanna make sure
this thing is legal, no doubts.

49:57.680 --> 50:00.159
Well, then we'd better move the
oil coolers back to the old position.

50:00.160 --> 50:02.399
With the oil coolers back, the
wing brackets need to be changed, too.

50:02.400 --> 50:03.599
Fuck.

50:03.600 --> 50:05.759
What the fuck
d'you think we're doing?

50:15.400 --> 50:17.919
<i>And with Hunt disqualified
from his Spain win,</i>

50:17.920 --> 50:20.599
<i>his championship year is not going well.</i>

50:20.600 --> 50:23.126
<i>And now it's all gone wrong
here at Monaco!</i>

50:23.240 --> 50:25.439
<i>His engine is smoking.</i>

50:27.560 --> 50:30.131
Smoke pouring
from the engine of that McLaren!

50:30.240 --> 50:31.759
And James Hunt is out!

50:31.760 --> 50:34.279
- Can you tell us what happened?
- Sure. It's magic.

50:34.280 --> 50:36.519
We've taken a great car,
a great piece of engineering,

50:36.520 --> 50:39.729
and overnight turned it into
a big, huge, stinking turd.

50:51.640 --> 50:53.051
Shit!

50:56.480 --> 50:58.799
What the hell have you done?
The car's evil.

50:58.800 --> 51:00.559
It's fucking undriveable!

51:00.560 --> 51:02.479
James, look, if there's a problem
with the car we'll find it...

51:02.480 --> 51:04.559
The car is a piece of shit.
You should be appealing this.

51:04.560 --> 51:06.608
- We are appealing it.
- We will sort it out.

51:06.720 --> 51:08.799
- They're killing us out there.
- Go and get your dick wet.

51:08.800 --> 51:10.639
- You're a wanker.
- Fuck you.

51:10.640 --> 51:12.479
- You're a fucking wanker.
- I will, arsehole.

51:13.695 --> 51:15.399
But this was a good race for you,
no, Niki?

51:15.400 --> 51:16.481
It's good for everyone

51:16.600 --> 51:18.489
that the quickest car
happens to be a legal car.

51:18.600 --> 51:21.331
James, you're 50 points
behind Lauda in the championship.

51:21.440 --> 51:24.887
You've had another retirement today.
What's going wrong?

51:25.000 --> 51:26.999
Oh, it's dirty politics
and dirty tricks,

51:27.000 --> 51:28.411
that's what's going wrong.

51:28.640 --> 51:31.079
<i>So, as we approach
the halfway point</i>

51:31.080 --> 51:32.844
<i>in this year's Formula 1 season,</i>

51:33.360 --> 51:36.679
<i>Ferrari and Niki Lauda
seem clearly on top,</i>

51:36.680 --> 51:39.729
<i>and James Hunt and McLaren
are struggling.</i>

51:39.840 --> 51:43.287
So, five races in,
how's it going so far?

51:43.680 --> 51:46.923
It's fine. Just got a little problem
with an Austrian rat

51:47.040 --> 51:48.679
and his team of Italian cheats

51:48.680 --> 51:51.199
- who have destroyed my car.
- What are you talking about?

51:51.200 --> 51:53.362
I'm talking about the race in Spain
that I won.

51:53.480 --> 51:56.689
- Yeah, in a car which is not legal.
- Five-eighths of an inch too wide.

51:56.800 --> 51:59.041
You know that doesn't have
the slightest effect on speed.

51:59.160 --> 52:01.527
But you complained and your team
of lawyers leaned on the authorities.

52:01.680 --> 52:04.879
Now we've had to rebuild the car,
and it's become a monster.

52:04.880 --> 52:07.850
- At least it's a legal monster.
- You've had to resort to cheating.

52:08.160 --> 52:11.721
You're driving an illegal car
and call me the cheat? It's pathetic.

52:11.840 --> 52:15.119
- Rules are rules.
- Yes, and rats are rats.

52:15.120 --> 52:16.201
Thank you. Thank you.

52:19.520 --> 52:22.239
Do you really think it upsets me, James,

52:22.240 --> 52:25.239
calling me a rat
because I look like one?

52:25.240 --> 52:26.969
I don't mind it.

52:27.080 --> 52:28.959
Rats are ugly, sure,
and nobody likes them,

52:28.960 --> 52:32.719
but they're very intelligent and
they have a strong survival instinct.

52:32.720 --> 52:34.404
- Wonderful.
- Marlene, <i>komm.</i>

52:36.080 --> 52:37.525
No wonder she left him.

52:55.400 --> 52:56.890
Anyone seen Suzy?

52:58.560 --> 53:01.079
She's supposed to be here today.

53:01.080 --> 53:04.243
We, er... didn't wanna tell you
before the race.

53:05.200 --> 53:06.770
Tell me what?

53:12.120 --> 53:13.565
Jesus.

53:38.280 --> 53:39.805
Is that from him?

53:40.400 --> 53:41.811
Yeah.

53:48.320 --> 53:50.482
So when did all this start?

53:51.720 --> 53:54.007
That weekend I went skiing.

53:56.800 --> 53:59.087
Why have you come here, James?

53:59.640 --> 54:01.085
I've come to get you back.

54:02.280 --> 54:04.169
You don't want me back.

54:04.280 --> 54:05.999
You never wanted to be married
in the first place.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.321
- Yes, I did.
- Oh, come on, James.

54:08.920 --> 54:11.479
You did it because
you hoped it might change you,

54:11.480 --> 54:13.164
settle you down, help with the racing.

54:13.520 --> 54:14.931
No, I didn't.

54:15.120 --> 54:17.319
And who knows?
If it had been just the drinking

54:17.320 --> 54:21.159
or the dope or the infidelity
or the moods,

54:21.160 --> 54:22.321
it might even have worked.

54:22.655 --> 54:24.999
- But when it's all of them...
- Yes, I know, I'm terrible.

54:25.000 --> 54:26.843
No, you're not terrible.

54:27.840 --> 54:31.003
You're just who you are
at this point in your life.

54:33.320 --> 54:35.004
God help anyone who wants more.

54:37.640 --> 54:40.883
And Richard Burton,
will he able to give you more?

54:42.360 --> 54:44.806
You know, he has quite
the bad boy reputation himself.

54:45.880 --> 54:48.531
What's important is how it feels to me,

54:48.680 --> 54:50.967
and it feels like he adores me.

54:57.055 --> 54:58.959
- James!
- New York Times!

54:58.960 --> 55:00.479
Are you and Suzy getting back together?

55:00.480 --> 55:03.479
- James, how do you feel...
- It's all very amicable.

55:03.480 --> 55:06.039
My wife has found herself
a new backer...

55:06.040 --> 55:08.639
I mean, lover, which makes her happy.

55:08.640 --> 55:11.239
And Mr Burton has found
a way of feeling young again,

55:11.240 --> 55:12.719
which makes him happy.

55:12.720 --> 55:15.079
Let's hope his pockets are deep.
They'll need to be.

55:15.080 --> 55:18.399
And I've found a way to be single
and have an ex-wife

55:18.400 --> 55:20.159
without it costing me a penny,

55:20.160 --> 55:22.399
which has got to go down
as the biggest win of my career.

55:22.400 --> 55:25.131
I have a flight to catch.

56:52.920 --> 56:55.519
<i>We haven't seen
this sort of intensity</i>

56:55.520 --> 56:57.199
<i>from James Hunt all season long.</i>

56:57.200 --> 57:00.199
Reports have been coming out
of the McLaren camp all week

57:00.200 --> 57:03.682
that their car is now fully legal
and faster than ever.

57:13.440 --> 57:15.568
Never mind the bloody wets.
We're still quick.

57:19.680 --> 57:23.082
Hunt has really closed the gap on Lauda
as they head into Druids.

57:25.240 --> 57:28.079
<i>Niki Lauda is under real pressure
from James Hunt</i>

57:28.080 --> 57:30.731
<i>as they go up the hill
into Druids Corner.</i>

57:36.560 --> 57:38.403
And Hunt is in front of Lauda!

57:45.920 --> 57:47.285
<i>So James Hunt gets the plaudits</i>

57:47.400 --> 57:49.279
<i>of the crowd, the first Briton to win</i>

57:49.280 --> 57:50.930
<i>a British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch</i>

57:51.040 --> 57:52.929
<i>since Jim Clark in 1964.</i>

57:56.455 --> 57:58.599
James, at the moment
you've got a terrific edge

57:58.600 --> 58:01.570
over the rest of the field.
How have you achieved this advantage?

58:01.960 --> 58:03.639
Big balls.

58:03.640 --> 58:05.130
Would you...

58:05.280 --> 58:08.319
<i>Following an inquiry
into the disqualification</i>

58:08.320 --> 58:10.721
<i>of driver James Hunt
from the Spanish Grand Prix,</i>

58:10.840 --> 58:12.319
<i>it has been decided</i>

58:12.320 --> 58:14.319
<i>- to overturn this disqualification...</i>
- Yes!

58:14.320 --> 58:17.799
<i>...and to restore his victory
and reinstate his points.</i>

58:23.960 --> 58:25.479
James! James!

58:25.480 --> 58:27.289
James, a few weeks ago
you were out of the running

58:27.440 --> 58:29.319
for the season completely,
and now you're right back in it.

58:29.320 --> 58:32.319
- What's changed?
- Well, it's a combination of factors

58:32.320 --> 58:34.479
not all of which I'm prepared
to discuss here

58:34.480 --> 58:38.804
but justice being done
re the disqualification in Spain helps,

58:38.920 --> 58:41.366
and having my car
back at its best again.

58:58.320 --> 58:59.970
James! James!

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.687
Welcome to the legendary Nürburgring.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.283
This is a 14.2-mile track,

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:38.128
complete with 185 corners and bends.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.999
<i>Welcome to the Nürburgring,</i>

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.606
<i>The most dangerous circuit
on the season calendar.</i>

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.730
In Formula 1 it is known
as the Graveyard.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.569
The weather conditions
are far from ideal,

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.250
and latest reports indicate

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.039
there is no relief in sight.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:59.919
Gentlemen. Well, gentlemen,
please be quiet.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.082
Thank you. Niki Lauda.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.805
Thank you.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.923
I called this meeting because,
as all you drivers know,

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.239
the Nürburgring is the most stupid,
barbaric, outdated

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.759
and dangerous track in the world.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.079
You've all seen the rain
that has been falling today.

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:17.799
Now, those of you with experience know
the ring needs perfect conditions

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.451
to be even remotely acceptable
in terms of risk.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.927
And today, with the rain,
it's anything but perfect,

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.199
so I called this meeting to
take a vote to cancel the race.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.282
Cancel the race?

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.439
There would be no change
to the situation

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.919
as far as points is concerned.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.639
- The race would simply be cancelled.
- This is bullshit.

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.959
If the race is cancelled,
none of us get our race fees.

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:41.399
That's true, you leave without your fee,
but you might leave with your life.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:45.644
It also means that you would
effectively win the championship.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.606
So, I can see why
this suits you just fine.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.571
Why? There would be
no points for me either.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.279
No, but there would be one race less

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.719
where I, or anyone else here,
could catch you.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:59.079
James is right. This is just tactics.

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.765
Maybe he's just frightened.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.805
Which asshole said this?

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.649
Yes, of course I'm frightened,
and so are you.

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:19.599
I accept, every time I get in my car,
there is 20 per cent chance I could die,

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:21.170
and I can live with it,

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.319
but not one per cent more.

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.641
And today, with the rain,
the risk is more.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:28.491
I suppose that all depends
on how good you are in the rain.

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.839
I have the track record here.

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.799
I am the only person in history
to do the ring in under seven minutes.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.485
So, actually, it's to my advantage
to race here today.

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.521
Because I'm quicker than all of you.

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:44.848
- Come on.
- Fine. Then let's race.

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:48.847
- Come on, Niki, let's race.
- Gentlemen, please.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.679
Why are we here, Niki? Come on.

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.531
Well, all those in favour
of cancelling the race.

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.484
All those in favour of racing.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.325
Gentlemen, the race is on.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.321
- Ridiculous.
- What a waste of time.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.564
You know, Niki, every now and then
it helps if people like you.

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:51.079
In places
the track is still dangerously wet,

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.599
but following a drivers' meeting,

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.199
a decision has finally been taken.

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.124
The race is going ahead.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:02.599
Niki!

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.364
<i>One minute to go.</i>

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:17.079
Jochen's going on slicks.
You wanna change?

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.639
- Is Niki gonna change?
- No.

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.722
Then we stay on wets, too.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.324
- Niki, okay?
- I'm good.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.280
All right, fire her up.

01:06:49.494 --> 01:06:52.279
<i>This season's fight for
the Formula 1 World Championship</i>

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:55.959
<i>has so far been the story of two men.</i>

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.639
<i>Thus far, it's been going
pretty much the way of Niki Lauda.</i>

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:02.325
<i>But James Hunt
has qualified fastest here.</i>

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.519
<i>He is on pole position
for the German Grand Prix,</i>

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:08.603
<i>with Niki Lauda alongside
in the blood-red Ferrari.</i>

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.519
<i>It's a long race.</i>

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:14.171
If the track starts to dry out,

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:17.124
the wet-weather tyres
will no longer be as quick.

01:07:38.535 --> 01:07:40.639
Niki Lauda
and James Hunt, side by side

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.803
on the front row of the grid,
go away absolutely as one.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.207
<i>Lauda very aggressive on Hunt there,</i>

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.322
<i>forcing the McLaren onto the grass.</i>

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.159
<i>Lauda has the lead at the moment.</i>

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.527
Lauda leads into the first corner.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.688
<i>Hunt is in second place.</i>

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:19.999
<i>Mass storming past Hunt!</i>

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.685
<i>He made the right choice
to go with the dry-weather tyres.</i>

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.009
<i>Mass passing Lauda now!</i>

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:30.045
<i>Jochen Mass, in the number 12 McLaren,
takes the lead!</i>

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.884
Jochen Mass the clear leader,

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.087
with everybody else making the decision

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.359
to change tyres
after just one lap of this race.

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:38.567
He's coming in! Come on, let's go!

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.770
See? I told you to go on slicks.
You should have taken my advice.

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.719
Fuck off. Where's Niki?

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:55.404
Behind you.
He made the same mistake.

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.889
Come on!

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:14.249
Come on! What's going on?

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:19.118
The tyre-changing frenzy has caused
a huge reshuffling of the pack,

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:22.090
- with Jochen Mass in the lead now.
- You're clear. Go!

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:23.765
Quick!

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:27.078
Lauda urging his mechanics to hurry.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.241
Quicker, quicker, quicker!

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.082
It's a disaster! Come on!

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.210
What's going on, you assholes?

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:11.199
This race has gone wrong for him so far.

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:14.647
<i>His championship rival, James Hunt,
is a long way up the road.</i>

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.999
<i>Lauda passing car after car.</i>

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.482
<i>He's just going past
Mario Andretti's Lotus there.</i>

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:19.202
Niki!

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:26.282
Get me out! Help me!

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.440
<i>We have an accident
on the course. Red flags are out.</i>

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:33.520
<i>Several cars are involved. Looks like
it might be one of the Ferraris.</i>

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.087
- Come this way.
- Come on, come on!

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.799
Keep trying.

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.040
- Come this way.
- Okay.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:47.839
<i>The flood, which swept
down Big Thompson Canyon in Colorado,</i>

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.559
<i>was the worst since records began.</i>

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.159
<i>In Formula 1 today,
victory celebrations were muted</i>

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:55.999
<i>after a horrific accident involving
world champion Niki Lauda.</i>

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.999
<i>Due to safety concerns before the race,</i>

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.399
<i>the Austrian had said
he would not take part,</i>

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.890
<i>but in the end he did.</i>

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:05.567
<i>He was making up for lost time
when he went off the track,</i>

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:08.047
<i>puncturing the Ferrari's fuel tank.</i>

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:10.727
<i>Brett Lunger was unable to
avoid the flaming wreck,</i>

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.879
<i>but was unhurt and joined with
the other drivers to rescue Lauda,</i>

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:16.770
<i>who was taken to Mannheim Hospital
with severe burns,</i>

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:20.521
<i>the incident reminding us again
of the dangers of Formula 1.</i>

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.719
<i>Niki Lauda was trapped
for almost a minute</i>

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:25.371
<i>in a searing inferno
of 800-plus degrees.</i>

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:36.479
- Do we have any change this morning?
- No...

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.403
<i>Frau</i> Lauda. <i>Frau</i> Lauda?

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.049
- Morning, chaps.
- Hey, here's the man.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:15.890
Looking good.

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:21.999
- What's going on?
- Jesus. It's Niki.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.048
- What about him?
- He's here.

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:25.885
- What?
- He's racing.

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.890
Niki.

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:51.045
It's that bad, huh?

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:53.771
No.

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:57.639
In hospital I asked them straight,
no bullshit,

01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.483
how bad my appearance would be.

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.087
They said with time it would be fine.

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.564
But it won't.

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:09.324
I can tell, seeing your reaction.

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:13.284
I will spend the rest of my life
with a face that frightens people.

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:21.166
You know, Niki, I tried to write you
a letter at the time, to apologise.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:25.280
The drivers' meeting in Germany,
before the race.

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.926
- I swayed the room.
- Yes, you did.

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:30.327
That race should never have gone ahead.

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.684
No, it shouldn't.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:36.839
So, in many ways, I feel responsible
for what happened, and...

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:38.410
You were.

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:41.809
But, trust me...

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:47.010
watching you win those races
while I was fighting for my life...

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:52.529
...you were equally responsible
for getting me back in the car.

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.965
- How are you feeling, Niki?
- Fine.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:26.999
Niki, can you confirm to us exactly
which procedures you've had

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.002
and the expectations for your recovery?

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.005
Sure.

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.999
I had a skin graft operation,

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.321
where they put half my right thigh
in my face.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:42.359
Now, it doesn't look too good,
but one unexpected advantage is

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:44.719
it's impossible to perspire
through a skin graft,

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:48.159
so sweat will never run into my eyes
again, which is good for a driver.

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.039
When they heard about your condition,

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:55.487
Ferrari immediately hired
a replacement driver, Carlos Reutemann.

01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:00.199
Yeah, before even reaching the hospital.

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:02.248
Is Reutemann
driving today, too?

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:05.684
Yes, and keen to make an impression.

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:09.879
So, let's see where Mr Reutemann
finishes and where I finish today.

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:14.085
James Hunt and McLaren have
caught up a lot while you were away.

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:16.210
Yes.

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:19.839
So is there a question now,
or are you just trying to piss me off?

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:24.849
You still think you can win?

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:27.079
Yes, of course.

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:29.082
I have the better car.

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:31.680
And possibly I'm the better driver.

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:34.359
But he's a clever guy,
and he's used his time well

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:38.410
while I was lying half-dead in hospital
to win some points.

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:43.045
And what did your wife say
when she saw your face?

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:52.799
She said, "Sweetie,
you don't need a face to drive."

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.928
"You just need a right foot."

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:57.607
I'm being serious.

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:02.283
Do you really think your marriage can
survive with the way you look now?

01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:06.968
And I'm being serious, too.

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:10.930
Fuck you. Press conference over.

01:23:15.615 --> 01:23:17.959
- That was hairy.
- Well, you got noticed, Clive.

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.319
I'll tell you that.

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:20.999
I thought it went well,
to be honest.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.799
They don't like it
when it's not going their way.

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.484
- Clive.
- That's the game.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.919
- See you.
- See you later.

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.809
- James, are you all right?
- Good, yeah.

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.679
Listen, I think
I've got something for you

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:32.479
on that last question, about Niki.

01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:35.086
You heard about that?
I did.

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:38.049
James.

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:46.851
Please, James...

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:50.764
Now go home to your wife
and ask her how you look.

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.611
Prick.

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:16.361
So Niki Lauda, just 42 days after
his near-fatal accident at Nürburgring,

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.039
will race here today at Monza

01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:21.806
against all medical advice
and no doubt in incredible pain.

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.239
<i>...Niki Lauda!</i>

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:07.281
<i>Photographers,
please clear the grid.</i>

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:09.682
Niki, it's time.

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.690
Okay?

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:20.771
<i>Please clear the grid.</i>

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:25.528
<i>One minute to go.</i>

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:14.239
<i>The returning Niki Lauda
seems overwhelmed.</i>

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.686
<i>He's being overtaken by car after car.</i>

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:29.609
<i>Lauda's off line.
He runs wide onto the grass.</i>

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.124
<i>He wrestles it back onto the track,</i>

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:39.130
<i>but that was a bad moment for Niki.</i>

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.279
<i>Niki Lauda's the reigning
world champion,</i>

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:48.489
<i>but maybe in his current state
he's a danger out there,</i>

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:51.450
<i>to himself and to the rest of the field.</i>

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:57.331
<i>And Stuck has collided
with Mario Andretti's Lotus!</i>

01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:00.643
<i>Niki's boxed in. He's got nowhere to go.</i>

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:18.641
<i>Niki Lauda is actually
making a move. He's on Brambilla's tail.</i>

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:24.571
<i>He pulls out of the slipstream
to overtake.</i>

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:27.641
<i>Lauda's starting to find the form</i>

01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:29.728
<i>that, early in this race,
we believed he'd lost.</i>

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:40.245
Lauda's now lapping faster than
Reutemann and closing the gap ahead.

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:46.731
<i>Lauda closing on Carlos Reutemann,</i>

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:50.003
<i>the man called in to be his replacement
in the Ferrari team.</i>

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.849
<i>And there's James Hunt's McLaren,</i>

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:03.406
<i>smoking stationary
by the side of the road.</i>

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:10.123
<i>This is bad news for Hunt's
championship hopes.</i>

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:15.931
<i>It's Ronnie Peterson</i>

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:18.407
<i>who comes home the winner here at Monza.</i>

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:21.490
<i>But all eyes are on the man
who finishes a brilliant fourth,</i>

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:24.568
<i>Niki Lauda!</i>

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.839
<i>What a race, what a man,
what a season.</i>

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:10.079
With a fourth-place finish
and three priceless points,

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:12.119
it means that Niki Lauda
is a major step closer

01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:14.327
to retaining the World Championship.

01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:17.039
<i>So, the long, gruelling
and incredibly dramatic season</i>

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.479
<i>comes down to this final race in Japan</i>

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:22.079
<i>in the shadow of Mount Fuji.</i>

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.559
<i>Niki Lauda goes into</i>

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:25.079
<i>this deciding race at Fuji</i>

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:27.319
<i>just three points ahead of James Hunt.</i>

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:31.609
<i>Hunt knowing he must beat the Austrian
fair and square to take the title.</i>

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:36.719
James, do you think
you can cope with the pressure?

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:40.247
Well, I've never really understood
what that means. I love my job.

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:42.408
I love competing. I love racing.

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:44.519
<i>Maybe you should ask Niki.</i>

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.879
He's the World Champion.
He's got everything to lose.

01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:49.279
Mr Lauda,
are you feeling pressure?

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:51.726
Do I look like I'm feeling pressure?

01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:57.930
I am World Champion, and on the verge
to become World Champion again.

01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:00.119
Hunt now has the opportunity to win,

01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:02.279
but it's not so easy
to become a champion.

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:05.409
You have to really believe it
to make it possible.

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:07.608
James, is there anything
you'd like to add?

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:11.719
If Niki is being tricky and getting
a kicky out of playing mind games...

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:14.087
...then fine, I'm flattered.

01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:17.761
But the fact is, momentum is with me.
I've never felt better.

01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:20.451
And I fully expect the next
press conference we will have

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:22.722
will be with me as World Champion.

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:27.079
How will you cope
with the weather, bad conditions?

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:30.639
Intermittent heavy rain
has been forecast here at Fuji today,

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:34.122
along with strong winds
and occasional fog

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:36.129
rolling in from the mountain.

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:40.639
<i>And so, with today's
Japanese Grand Prix to come,</i>

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:42.479
<i>Lauda's lead a mere three points.</i>

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:44.164
<i>What a way to finish the season.</i>

01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:46.319
<i>Hunt or Lauda?</i>

01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:49.324
<i>Well, the final chapter will unfold when
we bring you extended coverage...</i>

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:52.559
They've got to cancel the race.
It's lethal out there.

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:54.759
The race is going ahead.

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:56.679
Television rights have been sold
all around the world.

01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:59.399
The showdown between you and Niki
is all anyone wants to see.

01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:02.879
With heavy rain
continuing to fall here at Fuji,

01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.962
a decision has finally been made.

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:09.079
The 1976 Japanese Grand Prix
will go ahead.

01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:11.765
<i>All drivers
to your cars, please.</i>

01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:37.811
<i>Five minutes to go.</i>

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.519
- All right?
- All right.

01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:24.919
- Hold still.
- What the hell are you doing?

01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:26.719
To let the condensation out.

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:29.519
- It'll also let the water in.
- Not if you're leading.

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:31.887
Trust me,
this race is all about the start.

01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:36.371
- Need a hand here?
- Yeah, hold it, Teddy.

01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:52.490
Okay, start the bastard.

01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:57.130
Good luck, kid.

01:33:58.520 --> 01:33:59.931
Good luck, James.

01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:41.482
<i>Thirty seconds to go.</i>

01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:03.159
<i>Electric tension here at Fuji.</i>

01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:08.279
<i>80, 000 bedraggled race fans and
the racing grudge match of the decade.</i>

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:10.479
<i>And there's Mario Andretti
in pole position,</i>

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:12.482
<i>James Hunt alongside him.</i>

01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:16.639
<i>On Row 2 of the grid,</i>

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:18.599
<i>there is Niki Lauda,</i>

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:21.119
<i>and on Row 3 of the grid,
Jody Scheckter from South Africa</i>

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:22.639
<i>in the six-wheel Tyrrell.</i>

01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:24.722
<i>Behind him,
the rest of the 25-car field.</i>

01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:46.565
There's the flag, and finally
the Japanese Grand Prix is underway!

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:02.039
<i>In these conditions,
it must be almost impossible to drive</i>

01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:04.042
<i>a 450-horsepower car.</i>

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:34.279
<i>And it's Andretti who has the lead,
but Hunt is attacking.</i>

01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:37.319
<i>Hunt's going round
the outside of Andretti.</i>

01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:38.959
<i>Niki Lauda following him through.</i>

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:41.725
<i>Hunt leads into the first right-hander.</i>

01:37:24.255 --> 01:37:26.599
<i>Hunt comes through
to complete his first lap,</i>

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:28.079
<i>leading the field.</i>

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:30.208
<i>At least he has clear vision
in front of him.</i>

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:32.482
<i>Niki Lauda, behind him,
eating his spray.</i>

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.439
<i>Lauda is slowing.</i>

01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:56.399
<i>Niki Lauda is bringing
the Ferrari number one into the pit.</i>

01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:01.289
<i>Some sort of problem, we can't
imagine what, so early in the race.</i>

01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:11.047
What's wrong with the car?
What's wrong with the car?

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:13.929
Niki, what's wrong with the car?

01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:16.362
Nothing. Car's perfect.

01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:23.199
- What are you doing?
- I'm stopping.

01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:25.439
<i>His mechanics
are asking what the problem is.</i>

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.761
<i>But wait!
Niki Lauda's getting out of the car!</i>

01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:29.559
This is sensational!

01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:32.484
The reigning World Champion,
Niki Lauda, is out of this race.

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:35.159
It's too dangerous.

01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:38.369
Niki, you want me to say there was
a problem with the car, for the media?

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:41.170
No.

01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:42.971
Tell them the truth.

01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:45.410
<i>Now, what is happening?</i>

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:49.445
<i>They're talking to the team manager.
Lauda explaining something.</i>

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.359
<i>With Lauda out, James Hunt
knows he has to finish this race</i>

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:12.199
<i>in third place or higher
to be World Champion.</i>

01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:14.959
<i>But the job's not done yet
for James Hunt.</i>

01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:19.568
<i>In these dreadful conditions,
he still has to go the distance.</i>

01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:22.523
<i>Fifteen laps to go here at Fuji.</i>

01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:24.799
<i>James Hunt or Niki Lauda?</i>

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:27.959
<i>This extraordinary season
is not over yet.</i>

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:31.407
<i>In this treacherous final round,
can James Hunt hang on?</i>

01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:33.839
<i>And the scoreboard tells a story.</i>

01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:36.650
<i>Lap 58. Hunt in the lead.</i>

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.483
Oh, God, his tyres, they're blistering.

01:39:41.895 --> 01:39:43.959
<i>Brambilla
very close behind now,</i>

01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:45.928
<i>closing on him all the time now.</i>

01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:49.279
<i>And he's trying to drive
inside James Hunt.</i>

01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:51.806
<i>Hunt cuts across the orange March nose.</i>

01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:54.279
<i>Hunt's not having that at all.
And he's spinning.</i>

01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:57.519
<i>He missed Hunt there, but almost
took James Hunt out of the race</i>

01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:59.959
<i>and out of the world championship.</i>

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:02.691
<i>Now we find Mario Andretti
closing on James Hunt.</i>

01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:09.208
<i>Mario Andretti's going past Hunt!</i>

01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:12.684
<i>Hunt is slowing. James Hunt
seems to have a problem.</i>

01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:20.359
<i>Despite these wet conditions,</i>

01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:22.089
<i>these wet-weather tyres
do wear extremely fast.</i>

01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:24.328
Hunt's tyres, they've gone.

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:28.246
<i>Hunt nursing his car
back to the pit stop.</i>

01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:32.288
<i>That back marker's going past Hunt.</i>

01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:47.479
<i>Look at that left front tyre...
Right front tyre, sorry.</i>

01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:50.643
<i>No tread on it at all.
And the other one is flat.</i>

01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.928
Let's go! Let's go!

01:40:57.480 --> 01:40:59.959
Okay? When did you break
your gear lever?

01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:01.639
Nine or ten laps ago.

01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:04.086
- Alastair, we need to lift it.
- Come on!

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:05.959
- At the front.
- Let's go.

01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:09.239
<i>Regazzoni's Ferrari
and Jacques Lafitte in the Ligier</i>

01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:10.890
have gone ahead.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.679
Come on, hurry!

01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:15.799
You did it.
You're going to be World Champion!

01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:17.319
Not yet.

01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:21.159
<i>A few laps ago, James Hunt
was looking like champion elect.</i>

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:23.527
<i>Now it looks as though
it's all gone wrong for him.</i>

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:26.439
- James.
- Come on!

01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:27.959
- Listen.
- What?

01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:30.279
Just go easy out there.

01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:34.319
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying look after yourself.

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:36.279
We want you back in one piece.

01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:39.719
You're too far back. There's
too many drivers in front of you.

01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:43.725
- There's always next year.
- So that's it? It's over?

01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:45.679
Clear!

01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:47.205
James.

01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:50.803
- Clear!
- Fuck it!

01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:58.039
James Hunt rejoins the race
in sixth position.

01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:01.931
<i>There are four laps left to go.
Surely no way back for the Brit now.</i>

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:23.134
Concentrate, Superstar.

01:42:23.135 --> 01:42:25.039
<i>Just brings
it back under control.</i>

01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:26.319
<i>Sliding the McLaren</i>

01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:27.560
<i>on the very edge there.</i>

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:30.766
<i>Hunt's M23</i>

01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:32.559
<i>twitching this way and that
under braking.</i>

01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:33.960
And he almost loses it right there.

01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:36.801
<i>Hunt on the tail
of Jacques Lafitte in the blue Ligier.</i>

01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:46.171
Oh, don't do it, James.

01:42:49.295 --> 01:42:51.239
<i>He's inches away
from the pit wall.</i>

01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:53.049
<i>He's inches away from the Ligier.</i>

01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:04.559
<i>James Hunt has made up another place,</i>

01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:05.639
<i>but it's not enough,</i>

01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:06.880
<i>and this race is running out.</i>

01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:17.922
<i>And Watson has spun.
Watson has spun.</i>

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:25.399
<i>Hunt manages to weave his way
between that back marker</i>

01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:27.479
<i>and the stationary Penske.</i>

01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:29.559
He's catching Regazzoni

01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:31.279
but, in these conditions,
it's one thing to catch up,

01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:33.487
it's quite another to overtake.

01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:41.010
<i>He's alongside Clay Regazzoni.
This could be the world championship.</i>

01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:50.965
<i>He's got him!</i>

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:08.399
<i>Hunt crosses the line.</i>

01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:12.079
<i>Now, he needed to finish third to score
enough points to be World Champion,</i>

01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:16.679
<i>and in the confusion here, we're being
told that he may have finished fifth.</i>

01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:18.879
He finished fifth?

01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:21.759
<i>Our lap charts
show Hunt in third place.</i>

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:23.759
<i>Well, if the scoreboard's right,</i>

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:26.359
<i>it means he's just missed out
on the championship.</i>

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:30.001
<i>Crushing defeat for Hunt
after such a heroic drive.</i>

01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:36.559
I can see the race stewards conferring,

01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:38.279
examining the official lap charts.

01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:40.681
<i>We're just going to have to wait
for their verdict here.</i>

01:44:58.295 --> 01:44:59.959
Let's get you out of there, buddy.

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:02.119
I'm sorry, Teddy. I'm sorry.
I thought I could make up the ground.

01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:04.279
Sorry? What are you talking about?
You did it.

01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:07.119
- Did what?
- Jesus. You crazy bastard.

01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:10.329
You came third. You got the points.
You're champion of the world!

01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:14.083
<i>James Hunt
is now officially confirmed</i>

01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:16.248
<i>as finishing third here in Japan,</i>

01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:20.599
<i>and that means
he is champion of the world.</i>

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:27.359
<i>Our new World Champion,
James Hunt, by just one single point.</i>

01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.970
<i>Did we really win?</i>

01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:40.281
World bloody Champion!

01:45:48.975 --> 01:45:51.039
Tell us, James,
what are you going to do now?

01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:53.202
I shall be getting drunk.

01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:56.519
It's wonderful,
an absolute dream...

01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:45.519
<i>And our special guest,</i>

01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:47.363
<i>Formula 1 champion James Hunt.</i>

01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:12.842
Wait. Come on.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.559
<i>There's no better motor oil</i>

01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:19.164
<i>than Havoline.</i>

01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:31.679
Yes, me, too.
Where are we going?

01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:33.214
Anywhere I want to go.

01:47:33.215 --> 01:47:35.559
And I don't have to hijack it, either.

01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:37.279
As long as I pay for it.

01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:39.601
I'm starving.
Let's get some food.

01:47:50.415 --> 01:47:52.519
- Where are we going?
- You lot go ahead.

01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:54.488
I won't be a minute.

01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:02.004
Good to see you.

01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:08.481
I heard you were spending
more and more time in one of these.

01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:10.848
Do you fly?
No.

01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:12.730
I don't think they'd insure me.

01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:14.723
You should try.
It's good for discipline.

01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:17.400
You have to stay within the rules,
stick to regulations,

01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:20.091
suppress the ego.
It helps with the racing.

01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:23.239
And there I was thinking
you were about to wax lyrical

01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:24.844
about the romance of flight.

01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:26.770
No, that's all bullshit.

01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:29.365
So, what brings you here?

01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:33.079
A friend's wedding.
At least I think it was a wedding.

01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:35.999
Might have been a birthday or something.
It's all a bit of a blur.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.319
How about you? Have you been at Fiorano?

01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:38.481
Pre-season testing.

01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:40.599
- You're relentless.
- Thank you.

01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:42.839
I'm not sure that was meant
as a compliment.

01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:45.159
When do you start testing? Next week?

01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:47.199
No. What, are you nuts?

01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:48.999
I didn't just win
the biggest thing of my life

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:50.445
so I could get right back to work.

01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:54.445
Why? You have to.

01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:58.199
To prove to all the people who will
always say you just won it because...

01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:01.602
Because of what?
Because of your accident?

01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:05.168
Niki, is that other people,
or is that you?

01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:08.959
I won, okay? On the all-important day,
when it came down to it,

01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:11.879
we raced on equal terms,
equally good cars.

01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:14.119
And I put my life on the line,
and I saw it through.

01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:16.168
- And you call that winning?
- Yes.

01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:18.362
The risks were totally unacceptable.

01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:21.360
You were prepared to die.
To me, that's losing.

01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:23.119
Yes, I was. I admit it.

01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:25.999
I was prepared to die
to beat you that day.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.970
And that's the effect you have on me.
You'd pushed me that far.

01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:30.491
And it felt great.

01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:33.799
I mean, hell,
isn't that what we're in this for?

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:37.168
To stare death in the face
and to cheat it?

01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:41.320
Come on, there's nobility in that.
It's... It's like being knights.

01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:44.084
You English, you're such assholes.

01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:46.485
You know my position.

01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:48.239
Twenty per cent risk.

01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:52.039
No, no, no, Niki, don't bring the
percentages into this. Don't be a pro.

01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:54.691
The minute you do that,
you kill what's good about this.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.764
You kill the sport.

01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:01.530
James!

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:03.683
- James!
- Come on!

01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:08.045
I've got to go.

01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:11.528
Careful in this thing.

01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:14.050
James.

01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:23.046
You know, in hospital, the toughest part
of my treatment was the vacuum.

01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:26.284
Pumping the shit out of my lungs.
It was hell.

01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:29.283
And while doing it,
I was watching television.

01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:32.719
- You winning all my points.
- Your points?

01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:34.927
"That bastard Hunt," I would say.
"I hate that guy."

01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:37.639
And then one day
the doctor came and said,

01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:39.927
"Mr Lauda,
may I offer a piece of advice?"

01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:43.799
"Stop thinking of it as a curse to
have been given an enemy in life."

01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:46.039
"It can be a blessing, too."

01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:48.805
"A wise man gets more from his enemies
than a fool from his friends."

01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:51.727
And you know what? He was right.

01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:58.119
Look at us. We were both
a pair of kids when we met.

01:50:58.120 --> 01:50:59.959
Hot-headed jerks in Formula 3.

01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:01.803
Disowned by our families.

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:03.285
Headed nowhere.

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:06.759
And now we're both
champions of the world.

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:08.171
It was not bad, huh?

01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:11.239
No, it's not bad.

01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:14.801
So, don't let me down now.
I need you busting my balls.

01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:18.005
- Get back to work.
- I will, Niki, I will.

01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:20.808
But I intend to enjoy myself first.

01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:23.481
Some of life needs to be for pleasure.

01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:26.999
What's the point of having
a million cups and medals and planes

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.162
if you don't have any fun?

01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:31.689
How is that winning?

01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:35.491
- James!
- We're gonna leave without you!

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.445
James!

01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:42.691
I'll see you on race day, champ.

01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:46.602
You will... champ.

01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:50.884
You look good, Niki.

01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:54.330
The only guy to have his face burnt off
and it be an improvement.

01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:03.279
<i>Of course,
he didn't listen to me.</i>

01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:04.799
<i>For James,</i>

01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:06.999
<i>one world title was enough.</i>

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.519
<i>He had proved</i>

01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:11.879
<i>what he needed to prove, to himself</i>

01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:14.167
<i>and anyone who doubted him.</i>

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.889
<i>And two years later he retired.</i>

01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:20.801
<i>When I saw him next in London
seven years later,</i>

01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:23.048
<i>me as champion again,</i>

01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:25.119
<i>him as broadcaster,</i>

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:29.523
<i>he was barefoot
on a bicycle with a flat tyre.</i>

01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:32.484
<i>Still living each day like his last.</i>

01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:35.730
<i>When I heard he'd died,</i>

01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:38.207
<i>aged 45, of a heart attack,</i>

01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:39.845
<i>I wasn't surprised.</i>

01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:42.729
<i>I was just sad.</i>

01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:45.999
<i>People always think of us as rivals,</i>

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:49.607
<i>but he was among the very few I liked,</i>

01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:53.890
<i>and even fewer that I respected.</i>

01:52:57.040 --> 01:52:59.771
<i>He remains the only person I envied.</i>
