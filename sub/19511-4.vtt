WEBVTT

00:02.967 --> 00:05.500
Previously on "The Breaks."

00:05.567 --> 00:09.533
We found that motherfucker
that killed Bug.

00:09.600 --> 00:10.500
Run, bitch!

00:12.200 --> 00:14.200
If Barry Fouray and
Gordy Charlton are fighting,

00:14.267 --> 00:15.667
that's a story.

00:15.733 --> 00:17.467
What if I can give you
an even bigger story?

00:17.533 --> 00:19.033
You owe me money!

00:19.100 --> 00:20.200
A'ight, look, Lil Ray, don't
sweat me over that, I got you!

00:20.267 --> 00:22.133
What happens to me?

00:22.200 --> 00:24.133
Sadly, I think you just
became our new tour manager.

00:24.200 --> 00:25.667
You could've just
given me the credentials.

00:25.733 --> 00:27.133
Yeah, but where's
the fun in that?

00:27.200 --> 00:28.767
You doing big things, man.

00:28.833 --> 00:30.433
Aw, man.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.567
Word, we gotta
get in the studio.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.800
Have you ever tried
to do, like, a hook?

00:36.867 --> 00:38.167
You think my shit whack?

00:38.233 --> 00:40.533
It's a fresh start
without Juggy's initials.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.900
It would be great if you could
get your stuff out of my place.

00:43.967 --> 00:46.167
Okay.

00:55.233 --> 00:59.700
Okay, I can explain.

00:59.767 --> 01:00.967
I gave you
a blank tape.

01:04.733 --> 01:06.133
Okay, I'm gonna get
straight to the point.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.933
I'ma be real with you.

01:08.067 --> 01:10.067
Ahm, you got crazy talent.

01:10.067 --> 01:12.167
But all this drama
you putting DeeVee through,

01:12.233 --> 01:14.067
it's getting in the way.

01:14.067 --> 01:16.700
He's a good kid
and a dope producer.

01:16.767 --> 01:19.067
And he wanted to help you.

01:19.133 --> 01:20.267
Fouray wanted to help--

01:20.333 --> 01:22.533
Did I ask for help?

01:22.600 --> 01:26.767
You made a song 'cause you...
didn't want anybody to hear it?

01:35.800 --> 01:39.400
What's wrong with this one?

02:00.067 --> 02:01.333
You want me to
tell you the truth?

02:01.400 --> 02:03.567
What the fuck do you think?

02:03.633 --> 02:06.067
You got rhymes for days
but it's your flow.

02:06.100 --> 02:08.333
It's uneven.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.867
You just said I got rhymes.

02:09.933 --> 02:11.600
But not on this, that--

02:11.667 --> 02:13.900
That shit is cool
in a battle, but...

02:13.967 --> 02:15.433
Nobody wants to hear
that in real life.

02:15.500 --> 02:16.833
I'm not riding around
listening to 32 straight bars.

02:16.900 --> 02:19.167
Where's the hook?
Where the punch lines?

02:19.233 --> 02:22.367
You drop that, you wear
your listeners out.

02:47.933 --> 02:51.100
$25,000 bonus for Imani X.

02:51.167 --> 02:52.533
Where is that coming from?

02:52.600 --> 02:55.067
I mean, if that
rumor is even true.

02:55.133 --> 02:59.067
I'm curious...

02:59.067 --> 03:00.733
What's your angle
in all this?

03:00.800 --> 03:03.267
Exactly what I pitched.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.633
Is Fouray rap's new king?

03:05.700 --> 03:09.867
Stephen, you're taking too
long to say yes, yes, yes!

03:09.933 --> 03:11.300
I'm sorry.

03:11.367 --> 03:12.333
That took me so long.
That's all right.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.800
I kept you waiting.

03:13.867 --> 03:15.133
Secretive time.
Mm-hmm.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.400
That's rap's reputation
anyway, so...

03:17.467 --> 03:18.667
We'll sit right here.

03:18.733 --> 03:20.433
Miss Alonzo and I were
just clarifying

03:20.500 --> 03:24.533
that this is a profile
piece and not an exposÃ©.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.733
I'm here to tell a story.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.300
And in order to tell
a good one, I'm going to need

03:28.367 --> 03:31.067
a slightly uncomfortable
amount of transparency.

03:31.100 --> 03:32.700
Well said, a'ight?

03:32.767 --> 03:34.233
No problem.

03:34.300 --> 03:36.067
So, Barry, did you grow
up around music?

03:37.100 --> 03:38.700
Yeah, oh, excuse me.

03:38.767 --> 03:41.233
Fouray, what's up?

03:44.667 --> 03:49.967
Quik?

03:52.367 --> 03:54.133
What is wrong
with this thing?

03:54.200 --> 03:56.300
When you done
sabotaging the copier,

03:56.367 --> 03:58.833
Barry wants to see you.

04:02.467 --> 04:04.167
Having our artists
out touring

04:04.233 --> 04:05.733
helps keep the lights on.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.633
Like, today, Mike is
on tour right now.

04:07.700 --> 04:09.067
Rex Boogie has got
a show here tonight.

04:09.067 --> 04:10.867
We'll go.

04:10.933 --> 04:13.633
So, shifting to a label will
help or hurt Fouray Management?

04:13.700 --> 04:14.967
What do you mean,
shifting...

04:15.067 --> 04:18.133
Barry, a word?

04:18.200 --> 04:21.067
Yeah, all right.

04:21.133 --> 04:22.267
What?

04:22.333 --> 04:23.500
What are we doing here?

04:23.567 --> 04:24.633
What do you mean
what are we doing here?

04:24.700 --> 04:26.100
Let's just stick
to the agenda.

04:26.167 --> 04:28.400
Take her downstairs,
show her around.

04:28.467 --> 04:30.067
Take her
to D Rome's studio session,

04:30.100 --> 04:31.100
and then send her on her way.

04:31.167 --> 04:32.500
We don't know this girl.

04:32.567 --> 04:34.200
And now she's hearing
about Lisa?

04:34.267 --> 04:35.367
Which is just--
I'm on it.

04:35.433 --> 04:37.700
Okay, I need you
to call Lil Ray.

04:40.733 --> 04:42.633
I have an assignment
for you, Nikki Jones.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.233
I need you to run
this DAT tape

04:44.300 --> 04:46.067
up to our production office
in Philly.

04:46.133 --> 04:48.467
Otherwise the show
will not go on.

04:48.533 --> 04:50.067
Can you handle that?
I got it.

04:50.133 --> 04:51.467
Here.

04:51.533 --> 04:54.067
Also, Lisa is
way out of pocket.

04:54.133 --> 04:56.100
So I need you to go
check on J Mike.

04:56.167 --> 04:58.100
Good?
Mm-hmm.

04:58.167 --> 05:01.267
All right.

05:01.333 --> 05:02.767
You know
Lil Ray's gonna want.

05:02.833 --> 05:04.500
Yeah.

05:04.567 --> 05:06.067
Get it out the safe.

05:10.867 --> 05:12.333
All right, so, these are
the rest from the crates

05:12.400 --> 05:13.467
and all the duplicates.

05:13.533 --> 05:14.600
Take your pick.

05:14.667 --> 05:16.733
Thank you,
thank you, man, I...

05:16.800 --> 05:18.767
I need to be on my "A" game
for D Rome today.

05:18.833 --> 05:21.467
So, it sounds like
you're not planning

05:21.533 --> 05:23.400
on leaving town
anytime soon.

05:23.467 --> 05:25.500
Nah, man.

05:25.567 --> 05:27.067
And what about
the police?

05:27.133 --> 05:28.767
Haven't heard from them.

05:28.833 --> 05:31.300
So, guess they're
leaning on Ahm.

05:31.367 --> 05:33.167
Have you seen him?

05:33.233 --> 05:36.700
Nope.
Ain't lookin' for him.

05:36.767 --> 05:38.600
Ain't lookin' to be
his alibi either.

05:45.333 --> 05:48.233
No good son of a bitch!

05:50.333 --> 05:52.300
Mother...

05:54.167 --> 05:55.767
Yo, what was that?

05:55.833 --> 05:57.267
Didn't you hear?

05:57.333 --> 05:59.467
Sampson just stole
Chuck Chillout.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.567
That's what I told him--

06:01.633 --> 06:03.767
You are dead to me!
Damn.

06:03.833 --> 06:08.533
Hey, brother, least Sampson's
listening to you now.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.100
A rap show on WPPS.

06:11.167 --> 06:13.633
Bastard.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.633
Wait, do you know
who Bernard's

06:15.700 --> 06:17.400
getting to take
Chuck's slot?

06:17.467 --> 06:19.733
Gotta be somebody, I...

06:19.800 --> 06:23.233
I'm thinking...
Clark Kent, Kid Capri.

06:23.300 --> 06:27.867
That's not
who I'm thinking.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.700
Oh, you're crazy.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.533
Hello?

07:03.100 --> 07:05.067
Hello?

07:19.900 --> 07:22.200
Hey, I'm Nikki Jones.

07:22.267 --> 07:23.633
I'm with Fouray Management.

07:23.700 --> 07:25.867
Why are you here?

07:25.933 --> 07:27.867
No one's been able
to reach you--

07:27.933 --> 07:30.467
So?

07:30.533 --> 07:32.800
I'm just checking in
on you, that's all.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.967
Maybe you wanna
put that down?

07:53.767 --> 07:55.933
Yeah, we don't change our
artists' music and image

07:56.067 --> 07:57.533
so they can fit
the mainstream.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.700
We make the mainstream
flow to us.

08:00.767 --> 08:02.967
See? That just came over
from the record label.

08:03.067 --> 08:04.300
Special Ed.

08:04.367 --> 08:06.767
Special Ed is blowing up,
like, real nicely.

08:06.833 --> 08:09.667
Josie Cho.
This is Josie Cho.

08:09.733 --> 08:11.300
This is our
fabulous art director

08:11.367 --> 08:13.100
and a killer
with a camera.

08:13.167 --> 08:15.600
Let me see,
let me see, let me see.

08:15.667 --> 08:19.067
This is our newest
artist here.

08:19.067 --> 08:21.567
This is Imani X.

08:21.633 --> 08:23.533
Yeah, Jose, that's dope.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.167
Ah, yeah, thanks,
getting there.

08:25.233 --> 08:27.067
It's nice to officially
meet you, Miss Alonzo.

08:27.067 --> 08:28.333
I'm a fan.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.200
I loved you piece
on Sugar Hill Records.

08:30.267 --> 08:32.267
Thank you,
appreciate that.
Yeah.

08:32.333 --> 08:35.833
Mmm, you got fans over
here already, I see.

08:35.900 --> 08:37.867
So, yeah, we just closed
this endorsement deal

08:37.933 --> 08:39.633
for one of our artists
with K-Swiss.

08:39.700 --> 08:40.967
What size shoe you wear?

08:41.067 --> 08:42.367
Six-and-a-half?

08:42.433 --> 08:43.900
Where's Stephen?
Stephen?!

08:43.967 --> 08:45.067
Yeah.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.800
I need 6-1/2,
right here, yeah.

08:47.867 --> 08:49.667
You got a lot
going on, Barry.

08:49.733 --> 08:51.100
How did it all start?

08:51.167 --> 08:53.233
It started with a $700
loan from my parents.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.933
What do your parents do?

08:55.067 --> 08:56.867
My mother was
an EMS dispatcher.

08:56.933 --> 08:58.767
My father is a cab driver.

08:58.833 --> 09:01.533
Tried to get him
to retire, but...

09:01.600 --> 09:03.067
he won't retire, you know?

09:03.133 --> 09:06.067
Where we from,
you don't retire.

09:06.100 --> 09:08.533
You just work
until you can't.

09:16.233 --> 09:17.933
What's in the bag?

09:18.067 --> 09:20.733
Relax.
It's a sandwich.

09:20.800 --> 09:24.100
I brought one
for me too, see?

09:24.167 --> 09:26.333
You know, it's really not cool
you showing up like this.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.067
What choice did I have?

09:28.067 --> 09:30.067
My son actually gets
hired at the Ride.

09:30.067 --> 09:31.367
and stops returning
my calls.

09:31.433 --> 09:34.567
I never returned
your calls.

09:34.633 --> 09:36.467
What's up?
I'm swamped.

09:36.533 --> 09:39.833
You work, I'll eat.

09:41.967 --> 09:45.867
I understand you wanna
get more rap on the radio.

09:45.933 --> 09:49.467
I was thinking...

09:49.533 --> 09:51.667
We could do it together.

09:51.733 --> 09:54.700
You choose the music,
I'll get it played.

09:54.767 --> 09:56.900
No, thanks.
I'm not doing what you did.

09:56.967 --> 09:59.600
And what is it that I did?

09:59.667 --> 10:01.600
Payola.

10:01.667 --> 10:05.167
You know, hip-hop nowadays

10:05.233 --> 10:08.833
isn't so different from
rhythm and blues used to be.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.767
Major labels
wouldn't sign it.

10:10.833 --> 10:12.700
Radio wouldn't play it.

10:12.767 --> 10:14.700
So, you just galloped in

10:14.767 --> 10:16.867
with your sacks of cash
and saved the day?

10:16.933 --> 10:18.333
Every song you've ever heard

10:18.400 --> 10:20.800
has been bought and paid for
whether you like it or not.

10:20.867 --> 10:23.200
My little bags of cash?

10:23.267 --> 10:25.800
It's a DJ's rent money,
David.

10:25.867 --> 10:29.267
You wanna make a living
in the music industry,

10:29.333 --> 10:31.933
you're gonna have to get
your hands a little dirty.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.267
Hey, David, I want you to
cut these spots up for me--

10:37.333 --> 10:39.067
What's in the bag?

10:39.133 --> 10:41.033
It's turkey.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.367
Tuna, actually.

10:45.700 --> 10:47.500
Good to see you, Bernard.

10:47.567 --> 10:50.067
I was just heading out.

10:50.133 --> 10:52.067
Think about it.

10:56.933 --> 10:58.333
How did you get in here?

10:58.400 --> 11:00.967
Front desk gave me a key.

11:01.067 --> 11:02.733
Barry and everyone
is real worried.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.200
Go on then.

11:06.567 --> 11:07.967
Stop! Stop that shit !

11:08.067 --> 11:09.467
Okay, I'll just
hang it right up.

11:09.533 --> 11:10.567
Pull it out the wall!

11:10.633 --> 11:11.567
Just pull it
out the wall now!

11:14.833 --> 11:16.067
Fuckin' whole world
calling and calling

11:16.133 --> 11:19.133
since K Clive
dropped his new shit.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.300
Is it true, man?

11:21.367 --> 11:23.800
That you're just taking me
to task, is you, K?

11:23.867 --> 11:25.700
You and K Clive
been beefing for months.

11:25.767 --> 11:27.067
It's a diss track.

11:27.100 --> 11:28.433
Everybody know
that ain't for real.

11:28.500 --> 11:29.700
J Mike, Gay Mike,

11:29.767 --> 11:31.967
ain't never met a dick
that ain't right.

11:32.067 --> 11:34.267
Everybody on me about it.

11:34.333 --> 11:37.467
J Mike, Gay Mike.

11:37.533 --> 11:39.800
And Ion.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.167
12 goddamn years old,

11:41.233 --> 11:42.533
she had to call
for her uncle to answer.

11:42.600 --> 11:46.333
"What K Clive say is true?"

11:46.400 --> 11:48.067
Course it ain't, baby girl.

11:48.100 --> 11:49.700
So, just hit him back
like you been doing.

11:49.767 --> 11:51.167
Can't fight.

11:51.233 --> 11:52.233
Course you can.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.233
I don't wanna find it.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.933
I don't wanna lie.

12:01.967 --> 12:03.967
It ain't worth it.

12:04.067 --> 12:07.233
I'm fucked if it do
and I'm fucked if I don't.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.900
Get out.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.300
No.

12:23.367 --> 12:24.600
Size 6-1/2, right?

12:24.667 --> 12:26.633
Uh, yes, thank you.

12:26.700 --> 12:27.967
Page Nikki, still no word.

12:28.067 --> 12:29.667
Try J Mike's room.

12:29.733 --> 12:30.967
Okay, will do.

12:31.067 --> 12:32.600
Also...
Lil Ray is on his way.

12:32.667 --> 12:34.667
So, what's up?

12:34.733 --> 12:36.267
Yo.
Where's my money?

12:36.333 --> 12:38.600
Yo, Ray, what's up?
Damita Alonzo.

12:38.667 --> 12:40.500
Have you met Damita Alonzo
from the "Village Voice?"

12:40.567 --> 12:43.067
She doing a profile on me, Ray,
you know what I'm saying?

12:43.067 --> 12:45.600
This is Ray, Ray, Damita.

12:45.667 --> 12:48.367
Hi.

12:48.433 --> 12:50.167
Yo.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.333
Look, I just wanna
get squared away, B.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.967
I know, listen...

12:56.067 --> 12:57.133
With this last tour,

12:57.200 --> 12:59.367
we ran into some
unexpected challenges.

12:59.433 --> 13:02.900
But with Gordy out
the picture, I need your help.

13:02.967 --> 13:04.400
Help?

13:04.467 --> 13:06.067
Nah-nah-nah, I need
your help, listen...

13:06.067 --> 13:07.700
You know
I started my label.

13:07.767 --> 13:08.967
You know my label
gonna be dope.

13:09.067 --> 13:10.500
The tour money
is very important.

13:10.567 --> 13:12.700
I need somebody out there
handling the road, too.

13:12.767 --> 13:15.400
You do all that,
you got a position.

13:15.467 --> 13:17.067
On the label side?

13:17.100 --> 13:18.167
Yes.

13:18.233 --> 13:20.067
On the label side,
the sky is the limit.

13:20.067 --> 13:22.067
And you coming in on
ground level, yo, listen.

13:22.067 --> 13:25.167
I promise you, man,
smooth sailing.

13:25.233 --> 13:27.567
What's up?

13:29.733 --> 13:31.067
Yeah.

13:31.100 --> 13:33.433
Good! Good, good, good.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.500
Now listen, the hustle
starts right now, too,

13:35.567 --> 13:37.700
'cause you know, we got
a show in Philly at 7:00.

13:37.767 --> 13:39.933
I got Nikki there,
and I need you there.

13:40.067 --> 13:41.567
Say word, I got you.

13:44.433 --> 13:47.667
My dad put me out.

13:47.733 --> 13:51.467
I'm, like, 14.

13:51.533 --> 13:55.067
My Aunt Ruth takes me in
and she says that

13:55.067 --> 13:58.900
being gay is a white
people's problem.

13:58.967 --> 14:03.967
Don't worry, all you gotta
do is pray the gay away.

14:04.067 --> 14:08.667
That shit worked, too.

14:08.733 --> 14:11.367
At 16, I'm all puffed up.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.300
Me and the boys wildin'
in the Village

14:13.367 --> 14:16.367
just beatin' up faggots,
no problem.

14:21.633 --> 14:24.500
Up in the club, I'm spittin'
hard against gay this,

14:24.567 --> 14:28.367
gay that, you know?

14:28.433 --> 14:31.967
That just the way
it be flowing, but now...

14:33.833 --> 14:36.300
Now this come out.

14:38.233 --> 14:40.100
And if I don't kick
back at it for real,

14:40.167 --> 14:42.300
you know what's
gonna happen to me.

14:47.467 --> 14:50.200
Everyone's gonna come
after my faggoty ass.

14:53.533 --> 14:55.300
Then it's all over, man.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.800
So, uh, DeeVee?

15:08.867 --> 15:10.800
Mmm.
Who you been
working with, man?

15:10.867 --> 15:14.733
Um, like,
Joe Rock, uh...

15:14.800 --> 15:16.267
And this cat
out in Fort Greene.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.500
His name is Ahm.

15:17.567 --> 15:18.767
Barry's pretty
interested in him.

15:18.833 --> 15:21.267
Well, he should
be interested in you.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.200
Let me say, if you don't
make the beats,

15:23.267 --> 15:24.667
then we don't have a song.

15:24.733 --> 15:26.233
The man that's really
doing all the hard work

15:26.300 --> 15:27.367
don't get no credit.

15:28.500 --> 15:29.467
I work with
the producers, baby.

15:29.533 --> 15:30.733
Oh, yeah?

15:30.800 --> 15:32.700
Yeah, yeah, that's where
the big business is.

15:32.767 --> 15:35.267
See, my producers
work with Rakim,

15:35.333 --> 15:37.433
Special Ed, Slick Rick.

15:37.500 --> 15:38.800
Dag, for real?

15:38.867 --> 15:40.167
Yeah, man.

15:40.233 --> 15:43.267
Yeah, see Barry ain't gonna
put you on like that, man.

15:43.333 --> 15:47.667
Yo, yo, I'm ready.

15:47.733 --> 15:49.800
Ay, uh, let's take
it from the top.

15:49.867 --> 15:53.067
Yo, Tony,
rewind that two-inch.

15:53.100 --> 15:54.567
Why is Gordy
in there?

15:54.633 --> 15:55.733
I thought you said Gordy
wasn't gonna be in there.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.067
He's not supposed
to be in there.

15:57.067 --> 15:58.200
But he in there!

15:58.267 --> 15:59.567
I'ma dump him on
his head right now.

15:59.633 --> 16:01.067
No-no-no, you're not
gonna do that right now.

16:01.067 --> 16:03.167
Not right now.
You want a label or not?

16:34.967 --> 16:36.300
Ay, yo, yo, yo,
hey, yo, D?

16:36.367 --> 16:39.067
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

16:39.100 --> 16:40.333
Yo, Fouray.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.500
What up, man, yo, yo...

16:42.567 --> 16:45.100
D, your rhymes

16:45.167 --> 16:47.167
I mean, word to mother, man,
you killing it in there.

16:47.233 --> 16:49.233
But we need you to do that
one more time, man,

16:49.300 --> 16:50.933
'cause you said "debbed."

16:51.067 --> 16:53.467
Ain't no "B" in debt.
Just kill the "B" part.

16:53.533 --> 16:54.933
You're wrong!

16:55.067 --> 16:59.567
Do that same shit, man,
that shit was fresh.

16:59.633 --> 17:01.400
Yo, who I'm listening to?

17:01.467 --> 17:03.300
You crazy?
What you talk--
What you talking about?

17:03.367 --> 17:05.167
You trying to make him sound
like an ignorant motherfucker.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.833
He ain't sound like
no ignorant motherfucker.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.367
What is you talking about?

17:08.433 --> 17:09.867
How is he gonna keep
the "B" in the word debt?

17:09.933 --> 17:11.367
He's the wordsmith, fool,
ain't got no beat--

17:11.433 --> 17:12.567
So the wordsmith can
fuck the word up?

17:12.633 --> 17:13.967
It's a play on words.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.367
You act like you ain't never
done this before, yo.

17:15.433 --> 17:16.800
What-- wait,
where you going?

17:16.867 --> 17:18.567
Yo, Stephen, get back...
Get back here, come on.

17:18.633 --> 17:20.300
Get back here,
come on, man.

17:24.133 --> 17:25.300
Would you...

17:25.367 --> 17:27.367
Yeah.

17:27.433 --> 17:28.900
So, uh...

17:28.967 --> 17:31.367
I didn't see you
after the, uh, battle.

17:31.433 --> 17:32.600
You left early?

17:32.667 --> 17:35.800
Yeah, my kid.
Yeah.

17:35.867 --> 17:38.500
Bedtime.
Right.

17:38.567 --> 17:40.767
Because you killed
the fuckin' vibe!

17:40.833 --> 17:41.967
B, come on, man...

17:42.067 --> 17:43.467
It's kind of loud.

17:46.067 --> 17:49.667
Me and David are actually gonna
go see Rex Boogie tonight.

17:49.733 --> 17:52.467
Is that some kind
of invitation?

17:52.533 --> 17:54.867
Yeah, if... you're down.

17:54.933 --> 17:57.300
I'm already going
with Barry.

17:57.367 --> 18:00.300
But maybe I'll see you there?

18:00.367 --> 18:03.667
Yeah, yeah.

18:03.733 --> 18:04.967
Yo, you ready to do this?

18:05.067 --> 18:06.733
Yeah, I'll catch up
with you in a second.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.067
All right.
DeeVee, right?

18:09.133 --> 18:10.367
Yeah-yeah.

18:10.433 --> 18:11.833
It's dope.

18:11.900 --> 18:13.400
Ohh, that shit fresh!

18:13.467 --> 18:14.700
Thank you, thanks.
Yeah.

18:14.767 --> 18:17.300
So... all right,
right, right.

18:17.367 --> 18:18.833
You got fans.

18:18.900 --> 18:20.533
Yeah, all over
the world, baby.

18:24.333 --> 18:27.667
Gordy?
Yeah.

18:27.733 --> 18:29.433
I'm a journalist from
the "Village Voice."

18:29.500 --> 18:31.767
And I was wondering if we could
schedule some time to talk?

18:31.833 --> 18:33.467
Yeah, sure, cool.

18:49.667 --> 18:50.933
Yeah?

18:51.067 --> 18:53.133
All right,
I'ma come through.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.567
Gonna meet Demetri.

19:08.067 --> 19:09.933
Who you?

19:13.267 --> 19:15.367
So, you steppin' in
for the other two.

19:15.433 --> 19:17.367
Detective Anthony Purdell.

19:17.433 --> 19:19.433
Call me Tone.

19:19.500 --> 19:20.767
Got word you
may know something

19:20.833 --> 19:23.133
about a homicide in
Crown Heights yesterday.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.067
No.

19:25.067 --> 19:27.800
And the week before last,
your boy, Geronimo.

19:27.867 --> 19:30.167
Told y'all, I was
recording that night.

19:30.233 --> 19:32.900
Got a witness.

19:32.967 --> 19:35.433
If you ain't
gon' arrest me,

19:35.500 --> 19:37.400
let me pass.

19:37.467 --> 19:39.233
That's cool.

19:39.300 --> 19:40.400
I know where to find you.

19:40.467 --> 19:42.400
Hmm.

19:51.533 --> 19:53.200
Who's taking Chuck's slot?

19:53.267 --> 19:54.633
Tony Humphries.

19:54.700 --> 19:57.867
House Music DJ?

19:57.933 --> 20:01.033
I might have a better idea.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.833
DJ DeeVee.

20:02.900 --> 20:05.333
He killed it at the New Music
Seminar battles.

20:05.400 --> 20:08.900
You got some balls.

20:08.967 --> 20:12.700
All this time,
you Juggy's boy.

20:12.767 --> 20:14.400
I've seen you before.

20:14.467 --> 20:17.633
When I was at RL, he used
to bring you around.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.833
My PD Charlie Peters
told me

20:19.900 --> 20:22.433
this story about
the day you were born.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.533
He did?

20:24.600 --> 20:29.633
Juggy came through handing out
boxes of Cohibas to everyone.

20:29.700 --> 20:32.433
Old Pete said it's the only
time he'd ever seen him

20:32.500 --> 20:34.933
give something for free.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.100
All this time
you never told me?

20:38.167 --> 20:41.900
And you never tried to use
that shit to your advantage.

20:41.967 --> 20:43.867
Just bringing me
all this research

20:43.933 --> 20:45.767
and not asking
for nothing.

20:50.167 --> 20:52.667
What's the name
of this DJ again?

20:56.133 --> 20:59.667
All right, baby, just
please take a little...

21:04.667 --> 21:07.333
Shh, shh, shh.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.367
Oh, thank God.

21:09.433 --> 21:10.733
What's wrong with him?

21:10.800 --> 21:12.133
I don't know, I can't
get his fever to break.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.267
He's been like this
all night.

21:15.700 --> 21:16.867
What do you want me to do?

21:16.933 --> 21:19.300
Give... give him this.

21:19.367 --> 21:21.967
I gotta go to the bathroom
before I piss myself.

21:32.600 --> 21:36.433
There's a lot of hate
in the world.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.233
It's a dead end all around.

21:38.300 --> 21:39.967
Not all around.

21:40.067 --> 21:42.100
You come out with who
you really are inside.

21:42.167 --> 21:45.533
You don't hit back,
yeah, yeah.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.467
Your career, it's done.

21:47.533 --> 21:50.767
That's just the way it is.

21:50.833 --> 21:51.900
There ain't
no other options.

21:51.967 --> 21:55.767
What the fuck?

21:55.833 --> 21:57.167
Who's this?

21:57.233 --> 21:58.967
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa,
whoa-whoa, calm down.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.067
Calm down, baby,
calm down.

22:00.100 --> 22:01.933
It's cool, a'ight?

22:02.067 --> 22:05.067
It's cool.
You okay?

22:05.100 --> 22:06.767
I'm fine.
Get the fuck out of here!

22:06.833 --> 22:08.767
I ain't going
nowhere, a'ight?

22:08.833 --> 22:09.967
You feel me?

22:10.067 --> 22:11.600
Now put the goddamn
gun down.

22:11.667 --> 22:13.800
I'm not putting
anything down.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.667
I said put it down, J.

22:28.267 --> 22:30.167
I'm filling in for Lisa,
I ain't lie.

22:30.233 --> 22:32.067
I don't give
a fuck who you are.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.967
This is none
of your business.

22:34.067 --> 22:37.733
But she is.
So let her out.

22:37.800 --> 22:41.667
I ain't holding the bitch.

22:41.733 --> 22:43.767
His name is Lil Ray.

22:43.833 --> 22:45.300
He's a tour manager.

22:45.367 --> 22:46.733
He's cool.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.300
He's not gonna
call anyone.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.533
It's cool.

23:05.067 --> 23:06.867
Hey...

23:06.933 --> 23:08.400
Why didn't you
use your key?

23:14.300 --> 23:17.433
I'm gonna leave the Ride.

23:17.500 --> 23:20.067
Said he'd pay me a little
something, but he told me

23:20.067 --> 23:22.067
he'd never hire me
as Music Director.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.933
He's crazy not to.

23:24.067 --> 23:26.500
Three scoops?
Two.

23:26.567 --> 23:28.200
No, he's-- he's right.

23:28.267 --> 23:32.467
Plenty of other opportunities
for a white boy he said.

23:32.533 --> 23:33.700
This is business.

23:33.767 --> 23:36.100
The only color that
matters is green.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.467
Want me to
give him a call?

23:42.533 --> 23:46.367
I don't need you to catch me
another fish, Juggy.

23:50.567 --> 23:54.767
I do want you to
teach me how to fish.

23:54.833 --> 23:56.067
How to fight
for these records.

23:56.133 --> 23:59.200
Not just at one station
but at all of 'em.

23:59.267 --> 24:01.533
I wanna learn promotion.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.067
Speak the language.

24:03.100 --> 24:06.467
How to get label business.

24:06.533 --> 24:08.267
By myself.

24:08.333 --> 24:12.433
No hookups.
Just knowledge.

24:12.500 --> 24:14.367
Can you do that?

24:14.433 --> 24:16.833
I can.

24:16.900 --> 24:19.067
One more thing...

24:19.100 --> 24:20.667
I wanna do it clean.

24:24.933 --> 24:27.067
You got it, David.

24:31.667 --> 24:34.067
You ain't gotta trip
like this J.

24:34.100 --> 24:36.167
It's a diss track,
it'll blow over.

24:36.233 --> 24:37.600
This is hip-hop.

24:37.667 --> 24:40.167
What the fuck are you
talking about?

24:40.233 --> 24:43.067
Ain't nobody gonna
look at me the same.

24:43.100 --> 24:45.433
You sure about that?

24:45.500 --> 24:47.767
Maybe it's on you
and what you're looking at.

24:47.833 --> 24:50.600
I'm looking at a shit show.

24:50.667 --> 24:54.367
A two-face freak.

24:54.433 --> 24:57.967
I ain't coming out
to nobody.

24:58.067 --> 25:01.900
There's too much
hate out there.

25:01.967 --> 25:05.433
And I'm done
living a lie.

25:05.500 --> 25:09.567
So, y'all just
wasting your time.

25:09.633 --> 25:12.733
Just get out
and let me do my thing.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.233
Heh.

25:14.300 --> 25:17.067
My dad, he was
two-face too.

25:17.100 --> 25:18.900
Kind of hate him every day.

25:18.967 --> 25:22.100
He fucked me over.

25:22.167 --> 25:23.933
He was a bartender.

25:24.067 --> 25:27.967
That's how he made his money,
but... music was this thing.

25:28.067 --> 25:30.533
He played jazz guitar.

25:30.600 --> 25:34.300
He used to get a couple
of gigs after hours.

25:34.367 --> 25:36.067
He was always talking about

25:36.067 --> 25:39.367
quitting the bar and
doing music full-time.

25:39.433 --> 25:43.867
That's when he got, like,
this light in his eyes.

25:43.933 --> 25:45.600
He moved to New York.

25:45.667 --> 25:47.767
I got to see him play
a couple of times.

25:47.833 --> 25:50.300
He was good.

25:50.367 --> 25:54.367
The band he was in,
they even got a Grammy.

25:54.433 --> 25:58.633
I told him every day
how amazing he was.

25:58.700 --> 26:00.467
Then one day, he said...

26:00.533 --> 26:02.067
"No, Nick.

26:02.133 --> 26:05.733
"I'm just average.

26:05.800 --> 26:09.700
I ain't all that."

26:09.767 --> 26:12.100
Sort of matter of fact.

26:12.167 --> 26:14.700
Didn't seem to
bother him much.

26:18.767 --> 26:21.433
Couple days later,
he shot his self.

26:25.067 --> 26:28.533
Two-face.

26:28.600 --> 26:31.800
Kind of like how
you feel maybe?

26:31.867 --> 26:35.567
Hmm?

26:35.633 --> 26:37.700
But see,
the difference is

26:37.767 --> 26:40.333
I can tell you to your face
what your family won't

26:40.400 --> 26:44.533
be able to tell you after
you blow your head off.

26:44.600 --> 26:49.167
You see you different
than we do.

26:49.233 --> 26:52.900
The demons you have,
they're not ours.

26:52.967 --> 26:55.367
We want you here
no matter what.

26:55.433 --> 26:59.200
Just like I would give
anything to have my dad back.

26:59.267 --> 27:02.100
Even with all the shit.

27:02.167 --> 27:05.767
Because your family
and your fans...

27:05.833 --> 27:07.933
We just want you here.

27:08.067 --> 27:09.733
With us.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.900
Dents and fuckin' all.

27:16.067 --> 27:18.333
Hey, look, J, man...

27:18.400 --> 27:21.067
We can cancel the tour...

27:21.100 --> 27:25.067
the shows, whatever.

27:25.100 --> 27:26.300
I ain't gonna lie to you.

27:26.367 --> 27:28.700
You come out...

27:28.767 --> 27:31.233
This is over.

27:31.300 --> 27:34.233
A'ight, we all know that.

27:34.300 --> 27:37.133
But that's the shit show.

27:37.200 --> 27:38.533
Not you.

27:38.600 --> 27:41.333
And there's ways
out of this, man.

27:43.433 --> 27:47.200
Besides that.

27:47.267 --> 27:49.700
So, let us help you, bro.

27:49.767 --> 27:51.467
Let us help you.

28:11.333 --> 28:12.633
It's okay.

28:12.700 --> 28:14.900
I think we should
take him to the hospital.

28:14.967 --> 28:16.900
I'm not taking him
to no damn hospital.

28:16.967 --> 28:19.100
Last time they was all
in my ass about my record.

28:19.167 --> 28:21.133
Maisha, he could die.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.233
My baby is not gonna die.

28:23.300 --> 28:24.300
Don't fuckin'
say that to me.

28:24.367 --> 28:26.067
Water's cold, man.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.433
Could shock him
or something.

28:27.500 --> 28:30.567
You're gonna help me
or you're gonna leave.

28:46.233 --> 28:48.767
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

28:55.433 --> 28:57.233
Give him to me.

28:57.300 --> 28:59.333
Okay, okay.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.200
Come on, little one, huh?

29:01.267 --> 29:02.467
I know.

29:02.533 --> 29:04.300
I got you, hmm?

29:04.367 --> 29:07.333
Yeah, yeah, come on,
little man, huh?

29:07.400 --> 29:09.400
Yeah.

29:09.467 --> 29:11.867
That's not so bad,
right, huh?

29:11.933 --> 29:14.633
That's not so bad.

29:14.700 --> 29:16.633
It's gonna be a'ight.

29:16.700 --> 29:18.900
Hmm? Ah.

29:18.967 --> 29:21.200
Gonna be a'ight.

29:21.267 --> 29:25.600
You tough, hmm?
Yeah.

29:25.667 --> 29:28.800
Like your daddy, hmm?

29:35.300 --> 29:38.200
Sorry.

29:38.267 --> 29:40.400
It's okay.

29:45.267 --> 29:47.733
Okay.

29:53.867 --> 29:55.067
What you doing?

29:55.133 --> 29:56.967
What do you think?

30:08.100 --> 30:10.033
Watch him.

30:20.833 --> 30:24.367
I don't know, man.
You really that desperate?

30:24.433 --> 30:25.700
Look, Gordy's the only one

30:25.767 --> 30:27.533
interested in managing
me right now.

30:27.600 --> 30:30.467
So, like,
it could be something.

30:30.533 --> 30:32.733
Plus, I mean...

30:32.800 --> 30:35.767
What else I got going
for me right now for real?

30:39.133 --> 30:40.500
What?

30:40.567 --> 30:42.367
Why you looking
at me like that?

30:42.433 --> 30:45.100
Well, I did say

30:45.167 --> 30:50.267
I was gonna put a word
in with Bernard for you.

30:50.333 --> 30:53.000
Nah, nah.

30:55.067 --> 30:59.400
Yeah?

30:59.467 --> 31:01.233
David, if you're fucking
with me right now...

31:01.300 --> 31:04.233
Cross my heart, man.

31:04.300 --> 31:08.900
Chill out.

31:08.967 --> 31:10.900
Yo, everybody!
Yo, listen, everybody!

31:10.967 --> 31:13.067
If you wanna hear
the hottest shit in New York,

31:13.067 --> 31:15.167
listen to my radio station,
the Ride.

31:15.233 --> 31:16.400
I'm on there now.

31:16.467 --> 31:19.067
Starting when?

31:19.100 --> 31:21.967
Uh, every Saturday night!
Check me out.

31:22.067 --> 31:23.067
You hear me?

31:23.133 --> 31:24.367
Saturday nights, DJ DeeVee.

31:24.433 --> 31:26.333
You heard it here
first, all right?

31:26.400 --> 31:28.967
Yo, we're gonna
be working together.

31:29.067 --> 31:34.067
Oh, man!

31:34.100 --> 31:36.400
Oh, Juggy came by
the station today.

31:36.467 --> 31:39.300
For real?

31:39.367 --> 31:41.633
Mr. Aaron is going
to teach me

31:41.700 --> 31:44.633
the art
of record promotion.

31:44.700 --> 31:47.367
Are you serious?!

31:47.433 --> 31:49.500
Yeah, I mean,
you know, we'll see.

31:49.567 --> 31:53.367
If it doesn't work out,
it doesn't work out.

31:53.433 --> 31:57.333
So y'all are square?

31:57.400 --> 32:00.067
Taking it slow.

32:00.067 --> 32:01.567
Okay.

32:01.633 --> 32:04.567
Hey, I'ma try to hook up
with Damita after the show.

32:04.633 --> 32:07.067
I think I'm gonna give
her a buzz real fast.

32:07.100 --> 32:08.633
All right, hurry up.

32:08.700 --> 32:11.133
Hey, I'ma make like
a library, all right?

32:11.200 --> 32:14.600
Make like a library?

32:14.667 --> 32:16.867
Thank you.

32:16.933 --> 32:19.533
Thanks.

32:23.067 --> 32:25.100
Mmm.
Okay.

32:25.167 --> 32:27.067
Truth.
Okay.

32:29.667 --> 32:32.067
You were scared up there,
weren't you?

32:32.133 --> 32:33.533
Hell, yeah, I was.

32:35.067 --> 32:36.667
You put on
a good show, though.

32:36.733 --> 32:38.733
Yeah, right up until you
barged in and almost blew

32:38.800 --> 32:40.133
the whole thing up.
I did not.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.533
Yes, you did.

32:42.600 --> 32:45.600
It could've been worse.

32:45.667 --> 32:47.900
Yeah, a canceled night beats
a cancel tour any day.

32:47.967 --> 32:49.700
But living a lie
for the rest of his life...

32:49.767 --> 32:51.567
At least he's got
the rest of his life.

32:51.633 --> 32:53.300
If he'll keep doing
like he's been doing,

32:53.367 --> 32:54.567
then I'll keep
holding down the tour

32:54.633 --> 32:56.700
like I do on every tour.

32:56.767 --> 32:58.333
Two months from now,
it'll all be history.

32:58.400 --> 33:01.200
Mmm.

33:01.267 --> 33:04.067
Damn! For real!
Yup, yup, drink it up.

33:04.100 --> 33:06.333
Drink it up.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.233
Yeah, don't babysit that.

33:08.300 --> 33:09.400
Don't babysit that.

33:11.067 --> 33:13.233
True.

33:13.300 --> 33:16.933
The story about your father.

33:17.067 --> 33:20.133
You don't have to
tell me, but, truth or no?

33:23.600 --> 33:25.733
No.

33:30.067 --> 33:31.167
Damn.

33:31.233 --> 33:32.867
Damn, damn, damn.

33:32.933 --> 33:35.133
Mmm...

33:35.200 --> 33:36.500
You sold that shit too.

33:36.567 --> 33:37.633
Thank you.

33:41.600 --> 33:43.400
We did good the two of us.

33:43.467 --> 33:45.067
We did.

33:45.133 --> 33:48.367
I mean, I did all the heavy
lifting, and all this too.

33:48.433 --> 33:52.300
Really?
Mm-hmm.

33:55.067 --> 33:57.567
Mmm.

33:57.633 --> 34:00.067
We could be useful.
Mm-hmm.

34:00.067 --> 34:01.667
This could be,
like, you know,

34:01.733 --> 34:03.100
a little
side business.
Mmm.

34:03.167 --> 34:05.300
There's a lot of
troubled souls out there.

34:05.367 --> 34:08.633
Is yourself included?

34:08.700 --> 34:11.167
Number one.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.200
Hi, you've reached
Damita's voicemail.

34:23.267 --> 34:24.967
Please leave a message
after the beep.

34:25.067 --> 34:27.133
Hey, it's DeeVee.

34:27.200 --> 34:30.167
I, uh... I got some good news
that I wanna share with you.

34:30.233 --> 34:32.633
And, uh, thought maybe
after the concert,

34:32.700 --> 34:36.367
maybe we can go get
a drink or something.

34:36.433 --> 34:38.333
Hit me back, peace.

34:55.167 --> 34:58.267
David?!

34:58.333 --> 35:01.067
David!
David!

35:01.133 --> 35:03.067
Yo, yo, have you seen my boy?
White boy.

35:03.133 --> 35:06.533
Move, move,
get out of my way!

35:06.600 --> 35:08.733
David!

35:18.533 --> 35:19.767
He's asleep.

35:19.833 --> 35:21.833
Fever broke?

35:21.900 --> 35:23.700
Yeah.

35:23.767 --> 35:26.300
I guess our prayers worked.

35:26.367 --> 35:29.333
You shoulda thought of that
before I got in the water.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.800
Smoke always said
you was funny.

35:31.867 --> 35:33.500
I ain't never
believe him.

35:33.567 --> 35:35.633
Wasn't being funny.

35:35.700 --> 35:38.400
Hmph.

35:38.467 --> 35:39.867
Thank you.

35:39.933 --> 35:41.667
You good.

35:41.733 --> 35:44.300
It's nothing.

35:48.267 --> 35:50.233
You cold?
Nah, I'm a'ight.

35:50.300 --> 35:53.667
No, let me get
you a sweater.

35:53.733 --> 35:56.667
Yo!

35:56.733 --> 35:59.367
You really
believe in that shit?

35:59.433 --> 36:01.333
Not all the time,

36:01.400 --> 36:04.433
but when He gives me
a reason to, I do.

36:04.500 --> 36:08.633
I know they say you gotta
choose one way or another,

36:08.700 --> 36:11.633
but then He don't, do he?

36:11.700 --> 36:15.533
Arbitrary motherfucker.

36:15.600 --> 36:19.067
Take my man, spare my boy.

36:19.133 --> 36:22.933
No mercy one day,
but maybe the next.

36:25.967 --> 36:27.867
I don't know.

36:27.933 --> 36:32.433
Tonight, I guess I do.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.433
Heh.

36:43.067 --> 36:44.267
Yo, where's Rex Boogie?

36:44.333 --> 36:45.800
Probably in his dressing room.

36:45.867 --> 36:46.967
Down the hall on the left.

36:47.067 --> 36:48.367
Right, right, right.
Oh, um...

36:48.433 --> 36:49.900
Of course, do your thing,
do your thing.

36:49.967 --> 36:51.800
Okay, okay.
Coming down.

36:51.867 --> 36:53.067
Oh, DeeVee.

36:53.133 --> 36:54.533
Ma'am, ma'am,
please step aside.

38:02.167 --> 38:04.067
Everything gonna be chill.
We just gonna rock out.

38:04.133 --> 38:07.467
Ain't nobody gonna--

38:07.533 --> 38:09.533
Ladies, get out.

38:09.600 --> 38:10.933
Man, come on.

38:11.067 --> 38:12.200
What the fuck happened?

38:12.267 --> 38:13.867
It wasn't us, Barry.

38:13.933 --> 38:15.433
Someone on the floor
fired shots.

38:15.500 --> 38:16.833
We was back here
the whole time.

38:16.900 --> 38:18.467
You sure?
Yeah.

38:18.533 --> 38:20.633
Well, we got a problem 'cause
people got hurt out there.

38:20.700 --> 38:22.933
Well, I ain't do it.

38:23.067 --> 38:24.933
Folks died, man.

38:25.067 --> 38:26.333
They gon' put this on me!

38:26.400 --> 38:28.400
No, you were back
here the whole time.

38:28.467 --> 38:29.800
Listen to me.

38:29.867 --> 38:32.967
You were back here
the whole time, period.

38:33.067 --> 38:36.167
That's what you say.

38:43.767 --> 38:45.067
NYPD.

38:45.067 --> 38:47.067
Need to ask
a few questions.

38:47.067 --> 38:50.233
Of course, of course.

39:28.533 --> 39:31.400
Heh. Production office
won't leave me alone.

39:31.467 --> 39:33.467
Million fires burning.

39:39.667 --> 39:41.867
Thank you, Lisa.

39:46.233 --> 39:50.067
And thank you Gay Mike.

39:50.133 --> 39:52.500
Talk later?

39:52.567 --> 39:54.667
Count on it.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.500
I'll see you.

40:03.567 --> 40:06.800
Okay.

40:15.767 --> 40:17.800
Hello?

40:17.867 --> 40:19.667
He's gone, Nikki.

40:19.733 --> 40:21.133
Juggy?

40:21.200 --> 40:22.733
He's gone.

40:25.200 --> 40:26.867
They killed him.

40:26.933 --> 40:29.100
Juggy, what?
What--

40:29.167 --> 40:30.900
The concert...

40:32.367 --> 40:37.567
They killed my boy.

40:37.633 --> 40:41.533
He's gone, Nikki.

40:41.600 --> 40:42.700
David's gone.

41:00.367 --> 41:02.067
Next time on "The Breaks"...

41:02.067 --> 41:03.100
Mr. Aaron, what do you
say to the people

41:03.167 --> 41:04.400
that blame rap music

41:04.467 --> 41:06.300
for the violence
that took your son?

41:06.367 --> 41:08.100
I'm trying to figure out
how to stay off the news.

41:08.167 --> 41:09.400
So, just kick back, relax,

41:09.467 --> 41:10.967
and find you something
to worry about.

41:11.067 --> 41:12.500
I'll handle it.

41:12.567 --> 41:13.567
Mrs. Aaron?

41:13.633 --> 41:15.833
Nice of you to
finally stop by.

41:15.900 --> 41:16.833
I'm here if you wanna
talk, all right?

41:16.900 --> 41:17.833
Mm-hmm.

41:17.900 --> 41:19.100
Pow!

41:19.167 --> 41:20.800
Do it like Mama showed you.

41:20.867 --> 41:22.500
Stick with this
pre-approved set list.

41:22.567 --> 41:24.067
No rap tonight.

41:24.067 --> 41:26.500
If anybody hear about
our deal, they all dead.

41:26.567 --> 41:28.933
Did we really meet
at the New Music Seminar?
