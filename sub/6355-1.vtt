00:37.579 --> 00:40.748
You know, the smallest thing
can change your life.

00:42.125 --> 00:46.462
In the blink of an eye, something happens
by chance, when you least expect it...

00:46.629 --> 00:48.964
sets you on a course
that you never planned...

00:49.132 --> 00:51.800
into a future you never imagined.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.637
Where will it take you?

00:55.847 --> 00:59.933
That's the journey of our lives.
Our search for the light.

01:00.977 --> 01:02.227
But sometimes...

01:02.395 --> 01:06.273
finding the light means you must pass
through the deepest darkness.

01:06.441 --> 01:09.068
At least, that's how it was for me.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.404
Security team's ready to go.

01:12.572 --> 01:13.655
Move them.

01:16.993 --> 01:19.411
Ready? Move.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.295
Ready? Go.

01:29.672 --> 01:30.756
Don't move!

01:30.924 --> 01:33.175
- Three civilians!
- Check them!

01:37.639 --> 01:38.680
Woman and child!

01:38.848 --> 01:40.516
Stay left! Coming through!

01:43.561 --> 01:45.854
Three children, three children!

01:46.022 --> 01:47.356
I'm chasing one to my left!

01:48.233 --> 01:49.316
Go.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.747
Shit.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.041
Over here.

02:07.043 --> 02:09.044
- Castro!
- Right here.

02:09.211 --> 02:12.047
Bumping heads with third platoon.
Get on the horn.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.049
- I'm on it, Aces.
- "Aces"?

02:15.218 --> 02:16.677
You guys came...

02:27.397 --> 02:30.232
I got a man down. Need Doc Sanders.
First floor corridor.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.567
Secure the hallway!

02:31.734 --> 02:32.943
Move!

02:33.111 --> 02:34.736
Move, move, move!

02:34.904 --> 02:37.865
Talk to me, Castro. It's Aces.
We're gonna get you out of here.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.263
Roger. About 20 mikes. Helo is inbound.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.149
Let's move out.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.642
Now just sit.

03:52.815 --> 03:56.318
Mortar. Right where you were sitting.

03:56.819 --> 03:58.862
Three other guys didn't make it.

03:59.822 --> 04:02.574
The corpsman found this
in your SAW pouch.

04:07.997 --> 04:09.248
I saw you pick it up.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.251
Looks like it saved you.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.339
Got yourself a guardian angel.

04:19.007 --> 04:20.509
She's not mine.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.024
- Do you know whose picture that is?
- No idea.

04:36.192 --> 04:38.360
- You know whose picture this is?
- No.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.903
- No. Sorry.
- No?

04:41.864 --> 04:43.699
No, I don't think so.

04:47.870 --> 04:53.375
We're the wasted generation

05:17.233 --> 05:20.610
I'm telling you, man, you gotta set eyes
on that girl one day.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.071
You got to thank her.

05:23.239 --> 05:25.741
No question. She's the reason
you're still breathing.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.368
Give her a kiss for me too.

05:28.536 --> 05:31.163
I'm only alive because I followed
your crazy ass.

05:31.873 --> 05:34.291
We just got a couple breaks is all,
man. No big deal.

05:34.459 --> 05:37.502
Bullshit.
Things like this don't just happen.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.963
She's got you out of this mess.
We're going home.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.965
God, you're full of shit, Victor.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.384
I say you owe her. Big time.

06:29.013 --> 06:31.264
You're doing good.
Now look at my shot.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.688
Zeus!

06:38.856 --> 06:41.400
Buddy, hey. Come here.
How you doing? Hi.

06:41.567 --> 06:44.444
How you doing? Hey, buddy.
They look after you?

06:52.203 --> 06:53.954
Go on, ask her.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.498
So, Mom, when do I get my room back?

06:56.666 --> 06:59.251
Honey, let's make Uncle Logan
feel welcome.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.349
Mom.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.143
Go outside and play.

07:16.310 --> 07:19.688
- Come on, we were just about to win.
- Go outside now.

07:20.022 --> 07:22.983
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, fine.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.698
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

07:34.370 --> 07:35.871
He's gonna make it on YouTube.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.124
Time to wake up!

07:43.212 --> 07:45.130
Mom! Mom!

07:47.842 --> 07:51.052
Hey, sorry. Tim. Sorry.

07:55.057 --> 07:57.726
You know, the Corps
can get you some help.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.903
Why did I make it out
when so many guys didn't?

08:11.616 --> 08:15.076
But I feel like there's this debt
that I have to pay.

08:18.247 --> 08:21.958
I don't know where I belong.
I guess I should figure that out.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.465
I know there's no easy answer, sis...

08:28.633 --> 08:30.550
but maybe all I need is time.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.760
Any chance you recognize that girl?

09:56.012 --> 09:58.930
No, I'm sorry. Not in the boat region.
Good luck.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.640
Thank you.

10:07.481 --> 10:09.983
Hey, Roger?
Guy wants to know who this girl is.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.443
Beth Green.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.070
Runs the pet motel
just outside of town there.

10:14.238 --> 10:15.447
- Do you know her?
- Ha-ha.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.700
Girl can't look like that in a
town like this and not be known.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.952
Used to be married to a buddy of mine.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.287
What's it to you, anyway?

10:22.455 --> 10:24.456
Oh, I just owe her thanks is all.

10:41.766 --> 10:42.849
Hello?

10:47.897 --> 10:49.147
Hello.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.110
Can I help you?

10:55.196 --> 10:57.906
What a beautiful Shepherd.
What's his name?

10:58.074 --> 10:59.157
Zeus.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.993
- Oh, he's a sweetheart.
- He's good with people.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.828
Well, better than I am.

11:03.996 --> 11:07.832
Well, at least you don't introduce yourself
to the animals before their owners.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.460
- I'm Beth.
- Logan.

11:11.837 --> 11:15.256
So I came here...

11:16.717 --> 11:18.927
Excuse me for a second. Hello?

11:19.095 --> 11:21.096
Oh, Hi, Mrs. Jackson. Come on.

11:21.263 --> 11:24.557
I was just about to call you to confirm...

11:24.725 --> 11:28.937
that Selby is coming in today at 2
and he's gonna be with us for a week.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.232
Great. Excellent.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.943
No. No, Kevin doesn't
work here anymore.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.612
Okay, see you then. Bye.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.072
It's Beth.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.282
Yes, we do train. We're full service.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.076
I'm so sorry.

11:43.619 --> 11:48.456
Just bring in Napoleon's papers and any
dietary restrictions that he might have.

11:48.624 --> 11:51.042
- Monday is great. Bye.
- Oscar, get up here.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.755
Well, Zeus is way too well behaved
to need training...

11:55.923 --> 11:59.092
so I'm guessing that you're here
to board him?

11:59.260 --> 12:02.137
No, I'm not going anywhere.
I just got off the road yesterday.

12:02.304 --> 12:03.346
Where from?

12:03.556 --> 12:04.806
Colorado.

12:05.307 --> 12:07.142
And what brings you to Hamden?

12:07.309 --> 12:10.645
It's kind of a long story. Actually,
I don't really know where to begin.

12:11.188 --> 12:15.483
Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry. That's absolutely
none of my business.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.360
What can I do for you, Logan?

12:18.279 --> 12:20.947
I'm really here
because I came to see you.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.285
You see, I found this.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.829
Oh. It was just...

12:27.997 --> 12:30.707
Oh, you saw the ad. Of course.

12:30.875 --> 12:37.130
Okay. So the job doesn't... It doesn't pay
much. Mostly you'll just be walking...

12:37.298 --> 12:39.174
feeding, cleaning cages.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.842
It's six days a week.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.302
Zeus is welcome anytime.

12:42.470 --> 12:46.848
And help, Logan. That's the job.
We just need some help.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.393
Oscar. Get up here.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.313
Up.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.690
Come on.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.360
Can I borrow your pen?

13:04.366 --> 13:07.494
So besides Zeus, do you have any
experience with working with dogs?

13:07.661 --> 13:09.621
I worked with some bomb dogs.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.499
- Oh. So you were a cop...
- A Marine.

13:19.381 --> 13:20.548
You know what?

13:21.342 --> 13:23.343
You don't need to finish filling that out.

13:23.511 --> 13:27.931
Just leave me a number where I can
reach you and I will call and let you know.

13:28.098 --> 13:31.100
Sounds like you're having trouble
finding someone for the job.

13:31.268 --> 13:35.396
Why does a person drive from Colorado
to Louisiana to work in a dog kennel?

13:35.564 --> 13:37.774
I couldn't tell you. I walked.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.400
You walked?

13:40.236 --> 13:42.403
You walked here from Colorado?

13:43.572 --> 13:45.073
I like to walk.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.244
Would you excuse me for a minute,
please?

13:52.915 --> 13:55.208
You are such a stubborn boy.
Get up here.

13:55.751 --> 13:58.294
Come on. You can do this.
There's a good... Unh!

13:59.588 --> 14:01.381
- Did you take your medication?
- Oh.

14:01.549 --> 14:05.051
I'm still pumping on all cylinders.
That's all that matters, so...

14:06.303 --> 14:07.470
What is it?

14:07.680 --> 14:11.266
There's a man here who came to apply
for the job and I can't get rid of him.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.603
He looks harmless.

14:15.771 --> 14:18.064
He walked here from Colorado.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.316
Tell him you hired somebody else
or something.

14:20.484 --> 14:23.444
Why do I have to tell him?
You're the one that doesn't want him.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.947
Do you want to hire a crazy person?

14:27.199 --> 14:28.408
Are you crazy?

14:29.952 --> 14:31.119
I beg your pardon, ma'am?

14:31.287 --> 14:33.162
My granddaughter thinks
you might be.

14:33.330 --> 14:34.789
No, ma'am.

14:35.624 --> 14:39.252
Yeah, well, you look like a sharp,
capable young man.

14:39.420 --> 14:42.755
You tell me why there's a sharp, capable
young man wanting a job cleaning cages.

14:44.925 --> 14:47.927
Because it seems like peaceful work.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.345
My last job wasn't.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.931
Oh, where were you? Wall Street?

14:52.099 --> 14:53.850
No, ma'am. I was in the Marine Corps.

14:55.269 --> 14:57.520
Marine Corps.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.982
Hey. Down.

15:02.818 --> 15:05.278
- Train him yourself?
- Yes, ma'am.

15:05.779 --> 15:08.781
You're a good boy.

15:12.202 --> 15:13.536
How'd you get him to leave?

15:13.746 --> 15:15.663
- I gave him the job.
- You what?

15:15.831 --> 15:17.624
Well, we gotta hire somebody.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.793
You don't know anything about him.

15:20.961 --> 15:22.670
Neither do you.

15:29.178 --> 15:32.180
Just needs a little tender loving care.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.194
I'll take it.

15:46.362 --> 15:50.031
I got tools and lumber and the like.
You're welcome to them.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.324
Thanks.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.209
Come on.

16:08.842 --> 16:11.678
You know, you don't need
to be here until 7:30.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.764
I couldn't sleep.
Figured I'd get an early start.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.558
Well, we had a whale of a storm.

16:17.726 --> 16:19.394
That lovely thing came down.

16:19.561 --> 16:22.188
That's where we store everything
up there.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.608
- Teslin. Here's your new boss.
- Hey, boy. Hey, boy.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.736
- You ready to go?
- Who's that?

16:29.405 --> 16:32.991
That's just somebody that Nana hired.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.076
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Oh.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.163
Come on, baby,
we don't want to be late.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.542
Dad doesn't like it
when I practice in the house.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.460
So maybe you can practice
on the porch.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.421
- The little one.
- Hey. How you doing?

16:46.630 --> 16:49.757
I put Duckie in your backpack
for tonight.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.631
What's he doing?

17:30.799 --> 17:33.634
Can you believe that he got
that old thing going?

17:33.802 --> 17:35.803
Oh, good Lord.

17:36.805 --> 17:39.098
You know, I'm substituting
for Julie next week.

17:39.266 --> 17:40.808
It's only a couple days, but...

17:40.976 --> 17:43.686
Why don't you go back full-time?
It's been almost a year.

17:43.854 --> 17:45.980
I know how long it's been.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.988
Do you think that he has an off switch?

17:55.199 --> 17:57.116
I hope not.

18:11.131 --> 18:12.215
Can I help you?

18:13.717 --> 18:15.510
The hell you doing around here?

18:16.303 --> 18:17.970
Is there a problem, officer?

18:19.389 --> 18:22.975
There will be, you don't answer
my questions when I ask them.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.769
I work here.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.150
Put your hands on that bench.

18:31.401 --> 18:32.443
Why?

18:33.070 --> 18:35.238
Boy, you wanna do this at the station?

18:52.589 --> 18:54.173
A soldier boy?

18:56.135 --> 18:58.928
"Sergeant Logan Thigh-bolt."

18:59.096 --> 19:00.513
It's Thibault.

19:01.056 --> 19:03.683
And I'm a Marine.

19:08.188 --> 19:11.774
Well, where's everyone at, Thigh-bolt?

19:13.944 --> 19:16.737
They're all out. Do you want me
to give Beth a message?

19:17.906 --> 19:19.157
Oh-ho.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.742
So it's Beth, is it?

19:25.497 --> 19:28.124
You just tell Beth I'll see her at 4.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.263
You should come.
You never know, you might have fun.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.599
You've always loved their house.

19:44.766 --> 19:47.685
- Save your breath. I'm not going.
- Why not?

19:47.853 --> 19:53.941
You know I can't stand Judge Clayton
and his fundraising extravaganzas.

19:54.276 --> 19:55.401
Mom, check it out.

19:55.569 --> 19:58.070
Hey. Oh, that looks great, sweets.

19:59.781 --> 20:01.908
You look very handsome.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.896
Hey, Dad.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.774
Hey, wait. What in the world
is this mess here, now?

20:34.942 --> 20:37.485
We gotta teach you how to tie
a proper tie, boy.

20:41.281 --> 20:44.951
I love you in that dress?

20:45.327 --> 20:47.870
Makes me wish I never would have
signed those papers.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.790
Tell me about your new boyfriend.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.501
- What?
- Soldier boy?

20:53.669 --> 20:56.254
Don't ask me about him.
I didn't hire him.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.714
- He has nothing to do with me.
- Okay. Okay.

21:02.052 --> 21:03.469
Hey, Mama.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.471
Place is looking great.

21:05.847 --> 21:07.932
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.185
Thank you so much for coming.
Really good to see you. Here you go.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.771
We've got the governor in our camp.
I just heard.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.898
Benny. Wait a second,
where's my grandson?

21:16.066 --> 21:17.733
- There he is.
- Come here, Benny.

21:17.901 --> 21:18.985
How you doing, sweetie?

21:19.152 --> 21:21.904
He's fighting the good fight
for Hamden's future.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.949
- Tell your mama how we gonna win.
- Vote Clayton.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.158
All right, and?

21:26.326 --> 21:28.452
- The name you trust.
- And you know.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.454
- The name you know.
- Yep.

21:30.622 --> 21:35.459
- The judge you trust, the mayor we need.
- Ha, ha, ha. This kid is sharp as a tack.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.170
He's gonna do great things.
You mark my word.

21:39.464 --> 21:42.258
- Where did you dig up that jacket?
- Oh.

21:42.426 --> 21:45.052
Oh, come on.
It's just a garden party, Daddy.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.013
It's not just a garden party.

21:47.180 --> 21:48.931
- How you doing, judge?
- How are you?

21:49.099 --> 21:51.726
- Good to see y'all. Thank you so much.
- Nice to see you.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.030
Come on, Dexter, go get it.

22:04.197 --> 22:05.406
Go. Yeah.

22:05.866 --> 22:08.909
Yes.

22:09.077 --> 22:11.829
That's it, boy, get it, get it.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.333
Pick it up. Come on.

22:28.972 --> 22:33.100
That man is so irritating.
Every time I turn around he's just...

22:33.268 --> 22:35.519
Good morning.

22:38.940 --> 22:42.234
So you were saying?

22:43.320 --> 22:46.614
We moved around a lot, so I kind of
grew up everywhere, and nowhere.

22:46.782 --> 22:50.910
Oh, that must have been hard?
Changing schools, leaving friends.

22:51.078 --> 22:54.455
- It was okay. It was all I knew.
- But you went to college?

22:54.623 --> 22:55.956
Yes, ma'am. Just for a year.

22:56.124 --> 22:57.166
What'd you study?

22:57.334 --> 22:59.460
He didn't study much
if it was just for a year.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.837
Elizabeth Green.

23:02.005 --> 23:04.757
- I liked philosophy.
- Really?

23:04.925 --> 23:06.258
Yeah, I like to read.

23:08.553 --> 23:11.180
Give us a quote of your
favorite philosopher.

23:15.477 --> 23:19.772
"Sometimes the questions are complicated
and the answers are simple."

23:19.940 --> 23:21.774
Don't tell me.

23:22.109 --> 23:23.401
Voltaire?

23:24.736 --> 23:26.362
It's Voltaire, isn't it?

23:26.822 --> 23:28.155
It's Dr. Seuss.

23:29.533 --> 23:32.159
Thank you very much the tea, Mrs. Green.
I should get back to work.

23:32.327 --> 23:34.995
Will you call me "Ellie,"
for goodness sake?

23:41.336 --> 23:43.087
Voltaire.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.716
What sound does a tiger make?

23:49.428 --> 23:52.012
"This lazy ladybug
didn't know how to fly."

23:52.180 --> 23:53.222
I wanna turn the page.

23:53.390 --> 23:54.807
You can turn the page next.

23:54.975 --> 23:57.768
"One day the lazy ladybug wanted
to sleep somewhere else."

23:57.936 --> 23:59.645
Oh, this looks great, you guys.

23:59.855 --> 24:02.273
That's beautiful.

24:02.441 --> 24:05.109
Julie's not coming back
after she has the baby.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.319
We'd really like to have you
back full-time.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.363
I can't right now, Rhonda. I'm sorry.

24:09.531 --> 24:10.781
A violin?

24:10.949 --> 24:14.994
A violin? Only girls play violins. Don't
you play, like, basketball or something?

24:15.996 --> 24:18.080
Oh, fine.
The girl wants back his violin.

24:18.248 --> 24:20.499
It's his mom. Let's go. Let's go.

24:29.551 --> 24:30.593
Hey.

24:31.094 --> 24:32.386
You okay?

25:00.373 --> 25:01.790
Not bad.

25:02.876 --> 25:05.169
I didn't think anyone was listening.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.879
Glad I was.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.428
That's perfect.

25:43.041 --> 25:44.583
- Here she is.
- Hi.

25:44.751 --> 25:46.794
Oh, she's happy to see you.

25:47.003 --> 25:48.337
- How'd she do?
- She was great.

25:48.505 --> 25:51.257
- Make sure you bring her back soon. Cool.
- Thank you.

25:51.466 --> 25:54.760
Logan. Can you drive?

25:54.928 --> 25:58.305
Beth's out with a friend and my ride
to choir practice just fell through.

25:58.473 --> 26:01.934
My bossy granddaughter
won't let me drive since I...

26:02.102 --> 26:07.982
Well, you can hardly even call it a stroke.
It's more like a tap, really.

26:08.149 --> 26:11.360
- Hasn't slowed me down in the slightest.
- I can see that, ma'am.

26:12.612 --> 26:15.573
- How old are you, dear?
- Twenty-five.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.118
How many tours?

26:19.327 --> 26:20.369
Three.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.498
My grandson never finished his second.

26:26.293 --> 26:28.752
Yeah. You would've liked him.

26:30.338 --> 26:33.465
You two, you were cut
of the same cloth.

26:35.093 --> 26:38.971
You know, you live long enough,
Logan, you lose enough people...

26:39.139 --> 26:41.849
you learn to appreciate
the memories you have.

26:42.017 --> 26:44.852
Stop begrudging the ones
you never got to make.

26:47.147 --> 26:49.064
Beth hasn't lived as long as I have.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.235
She isn't as bad as she seems.

26:55.530 --> 26:57.323
She doesn't seem so bad to me.

27:05.206 --> 27:06.373
Hello?

28:31.501 --> 28:33.711
All right, thank you. I'll see you later.

28:49.269 --> 28:52.062
Yeah.

28:52.230 --> 28:54.148
Yes. Here we go.

28:58.319 --> 28:59.570
Come, come, come.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.780
Oh, thank you, honey.
Good job. That's it.

29:01.948 --> 29:03.031
Night, all.

29:03.199 --> 29:04.241
Do you like jambalaya?

29:04.409 --> 29:07.494
No. Ben. Ben, I'm sure that Logan
already has plans.

29:07.662 --> 29:08.704
Do you?

29:08.872 --> 29:11.290
I can't remember the last time
I had a plan.

29:11.458 --> 29:13.125
All right, man. You got dance moves?

29:13.293 --> 29:16.003
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Yeah, what you got?

29:20.300 --> 29:23.302
Mom ran track. She was super-fast.

29:23.470 --> 29:25.137
Cross-country, I wasn't that good.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.306
Is that why you got a scholarship
to Tulane?

29:27.474 --> 29:28.849
Because you weren't any good?

29:29.017 --> 29:33.103
Okay. Once upon a time
I was pretty good.

29:33.271 --> 29:35.105
Are you happy?

29:35.273 --> 29:36.315
You went to Tulane?

29:36.483 --> 29:39.359
No, State to be close to home.
Had some personal stuff come up.

29:39.527 --> 29:41.528
She got pregnant. With me.

29:41.696 --> 29:43.280
Well, thank you, Benjamin.

29:44.949 --> 29:47.201
Isn't it your night for the dishes?

29:48.745 --> 29:50.204
Thank you.

29:51.372 --> 29:52.831
Do you still run competitively?

29:52.999 --> 29:57.795
Oh, no, no, no. Now I just do it to clear my head.
It's a lot cheaper than therapy, so...

29:58.379 --> 29:59.755
So is walking.

30:01.341 --> 30:03.634
- Who plays chess?
- Me.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.260
Me too.

30:05.428 --> 30:06.512
Bet I can beat you.

30:06.679 --> 30:08.639
- What's the bet?
- Dishes tonight.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.391
Dishes tonight,
against the pooper scooper tomorrow.

30:14.103 --> 30:15.896
Gotta warn you, I'm not bad.

30:38.586 --> 30:39.628
Check.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.053
Let's do a flip.

30:48.221 --> 30:49.805
Oh, that was cool.

30:49.973 --> 30:51.348
Wheelie.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.433
Somersault.

30:59.899 --> 31:01.275
Checkmate.

31:02.527 --> 31:05.028
Detergent is under the sink.

31:05.196 --> 31:08.031
What? Did I just get hustled?

31:09.742 --> 31:11.869
Have to admit,
I played better the second time.

31:12.036 --> 31:14.288
Sure. Until your second move.

31:14.455 --> 31:16.957
You have any other secret talents
I should know about?

31:17.125 --> 31:18.834
You're the one with the secret.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.130
I saw him playing the piano.

31:23.298 --> 31:24.631
Really?

31:24.799 --> 31:26.133
Yeah.

31:26.801 --> 31:28.594
I saw it when I put the keys back.

31:28.761 --> 31:29.887
He's really good.

31:30.054 --> 31:31.638
Hey, you're not too bad yourself.

31:31.806 --> 31:35.142
- Why don't you play something for us?
- How about a magic trick instead?

31:35.518 --> 31:36.602
Yeah, okay.

31:36.769 --> 31:40.314
He hates playing for people.
He doesn't think that he's good enough.

31:42.942 --> 31:44.276
Ordinary deck.

31:44.444 --> 31:46.028
Okay, cool.

31:47.655 --> 31:49.823
- Oh. It's all right.
- Ha-ha.

31:49.991 --> 31:51.533
Show me again.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.493
- Tell me when to stop.
- Stop.

31:54.954 --> 31:57.956
Memorize the card,
and I am not looking.

31:58.416 --> 31:59.875
Okay, I got it.

32:00.793 --> 32:03.086
Let me give it a little magic.

32:06.633 --> 32:09.760
- I didn't know you were a magician too.
- Wait till you see this one.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.678
Ben, sweetie, it's past your bedtime.

32:11.846 --> 32:14.306
- Wait, this is the best one.
- Show me tomorrow.

32:14.474 --> 32:16.266
Ben, say good night to Logan, now.

32:16.434 --> 32:19.811
- Come on.
- No. I just wanted to show him a trick.

32:20.688 --> 32:22.606
I'm sorry. He's not usually...

32:22.774 --> 32:24.983
It's fine. It's fine.

32:26.861 --> 32:28.987
My brother taught him a few tricks.

32:30.281 --> 32:33.450
Magic was kind of their thing.

32:34.118 --> 32:36.203
We lost him last year.

32:38.456 --> 32:40.332
He was a Marine too.

32:40.833 --> 32:42.876
It's been hard on Ben.

32:44.212 --> 32:45.879
It's been hard on all of us.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.218
Thank you.

32:51.386 --> 32:53.220
We share

32:56.307 --> 32:57.849
Well, I'm glad you came.

33:02.730 --> 33:05.649
Aren't you helpful, dear, and chivalrous?
You are so...?

33:05.817 --> 33:07.234
Isn't he chivalrous?

33:07.402 --> 33:08.527
Have you been drinking?

33:08.695 --> 33:11.113
I had a little something
called a Moscow Mule.

33:11.280 --> 33:13.115
It sounds terrible, but it was so good.

33:13.282 --> 33:15.742
- I'll make you a cup of tea.
- Oh, good.

33:16.744 --> 33:18.036
Okay.

33:18.246 --> 33:21.581
Look, there's something that
I've been meaning to tell you.

33:21.749 --> 33:25.627
I never fully explained how...

33:28.131 --> 33:30.173
And I'm sorry,
I can't find the right words.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.134
It's all right.

33:33.469 --> 33:35.178
Another time, maybe.

33:37.473 --> 33:39.474
After all, I'm not going anywhere.

33:41.477 --> 33:42.769
Okay.

33:45.481 --> 33:46.898
Good night, Logan.

36:01.826 --> 36:02.868
No. No!

36:03.035 --> 36:04.369
Jesus!

36:05.705 --> 36:06.788
No!

36:08.708 --> 36:10.500
Beth! Beth!

36:10.668 --> 36:13.003
No! Stop it!

36:22.930 --> 36:24.222
No.

36:25.808 --> 36:27.225
It's okay.

36:28.352 --> 36:29.686
It's okay.

36:48.998 --> 36:51.541
At first they wouldn't tell us anything.

36:53.878 --> 36:57.005
Just that friendly fire was a possibility.

36:57.256 --> 36:59.257
So it's a year ago today...

36:59.425 --> 37:03.720
and the official investigation
into the death of Sergeant...

37:06.349 --> 37:07.641
Drake...

37:09.769 --> 37:11.061
Green...

37:11.938 --> 37:13.230
is still ongoing.

37:13.397 --> 37:16.983
That's the worst part. Not knowing.

37:18.361 --> 37:20.278
I would give anything...

37:21.197 --> 37:25.700
I would give anything to know
that he didn't die for nothing.

37:27.495 --> 37:32.707
We were inseparable as kids, you know?
We did everything together.

37:34.585 --> 37:36.795
We even built that wall together.

37:38.881 --> 37:43.051
Well, Drake built the wall...

37:43.928 --> 37:45.595
and I supervised...

37:46.389 --> 37:49.849
which consisted mostly of drinking
iced teas and reading the Brontës.

37:51.519 --> 37:54.562
Oh. This one day...

37:57.441 --> 37:59.609
I couldn't find my book anywhere.

38:00.152 --> 38:02.487
So I asked him about it.

38:04.156 --> 38:05.865
And he just pointed.

38:06.534 --> 38:08.326
Look. Look.

38:17.962 --> 38:22.090
God, I was so mad.
I was so mad at him.

38:22.258 --> 38:24.718
And he just laughed.

38:33.227 --> 38:34.978
It was...

39:01.339 --> 39:02.422
I'm sorry.

39:02.590 --> 39:03.673
It's okay.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.259
You got a great laugh, you know that?

39:07.136 --> 39:09.763
I wish I could hear it more.

39:10.973 --> 39:13.308
Why don't you try telling me a joke?

39:13.559 --> 39:17.812
Because you're gonna have to get a few beers
in me before I start telling you jokes.

39:20.858 --> 39:22.067
Okay.

39:23.319 --> 39:24.527
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:37.249 --> 39:41.378
"...Except for Ron and Hermione's slow,
deep breathing."

39:41.545 --> 39:45.965
Harry glanced over at the dark shapes
they made on the floor beside him.

39:47.009 --> 39:48.802
"Ron had had a fit of..."

39:55.643 --> 39:57.060
Mom.

39:57.645 --> 40:00.605
- Mom.
- Yes. "On the sofa. Hermione's..."

40:00.773 --> 40:03.358
"...So that her silotee..."

40:03.526 --> 40:04.609
Silhouette.

40:04.944 --> 40:06.611
Come on, Brutus. Hi, buddy.

40:09.657 --> 40:12.075
All right. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

40:13.661 --> 40:15.745
Ha-ha. Oh, come on. What...?

40:23.003 --> 40:24.045
Shake.

40:29.635 --> 40:31.094
Wa-yaah!

40:33.264 --> 40:35.181
What's the black dog tag for?

40:35.349 --> 40:39.018
This one's mine, and the black one is
in memory of my best buddy, Victor.

40:39.186 --> 40:41.438
So they're like friendship bracelets.

40:41.605 --> 40:44.357
Yeah. Yeah, you could say that.

40:45.192 --> 40:47.318
No... Oh, man, he's toast.

40:47.486 --> 40:48.778
- Your turn.
- Don't. No.

40:48.946 --> 40:50.321
Where you going?

40:50.489 --> 40:53.867
Hey. You can run, man,
I'm gonna make a Marine out of you.

41:14.513 --> 41:16.514
Get over. Go through.

41:17.224 --> 41:18.349
Up!

41:18.517 --> 41:19.601
See.

41:22.438 --> 41:24.606
I've been working on my pop-ups
all week.

41:25.107 --> 41:28.902
- All right. That's my boy.
- There you go. Get in the car.

41:29.069 --> 41:30.111
See.

41:30.321 --> 41:33.865
- How's old Thigh-Bolt working out for you?
- Do me a favor, okay?

41:34.033 --> 41:36.743
Try and remember
this is a charity game.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.703
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

41:38.871 --> 41:40.330
Don't push him too hard, okay?

41:40.498 --> 41:42.582
Hey, you know what?

41:42.750 --> 41:45.376
When Benny's on your time,
you guys do what you want.

41:45.544 --> 41:49.255
You can plant your flowers, you can do
your crochet, play the fiddle, whatever.

41:49.423 --> 41:51.257
When he's with me we do it my way.

41:51.425 --> 41:53.176
- Have fun, sweetie. Seat belt.
- Bye, Mom.

41:53.511 --> 41:57.055
- Need to give the kid some room to breathe.
- I'm okay.

42:01.435 --> 42:02.727
No.

42:03.312 --> 42:04.604
Cooper.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.232
Cooper, stop.

42:17.618 --> 42:19.702
That's $9. Thank you.

42:19.870 --> 42:21.454
I'm gonna get going.

42:21.956 --> 42:24.123
I'll be back later to help you pack up.

42:33.050 --> 42:35.468
Hey. What's up?

42:35.803 --> 42:37.595
- Unh. There you go.
- Oh.

42:37.763 --> 42:38.805
- What happened?
- We won!

42:38.973 --> 42:41.808
Oh, he took his eye off a ground ball.

42:41.976 --> 42:44.894
It's not as bad as it looks.
He just got a little nosebleed.

42:45.062 --> 42:49.440
I still stopped it. Got my glove down,
kept my body in front. Only one run scored.

42:49.608 --> 42:51.109
Ha, ha. It was the play of the game.

42:51.277 --> 42:53.861
Tell you what,
might make a man out of him yet.

42:54.238 --> 42:57.240
Why don't you go on inside?
Take a shower. I'll be right there.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.784
- See you later, buddy.
- Bye, Dad.

43:00.828 --> 43:02.996
What? It was an accident.

43:03.163 --> 43:04.747
You really don't see it.

43:04.915 --> 43:05.957
See what?

43:06.125 --> 43:08.501
That boy would run through
a brick wall for you.

43:08.669 --> 43:12.088
What does that gotta do with him
not being able to field a ground ball?

43:13.507 --> 43:14.757
Okay.

43:14.925 --> 43:17.969
Don't worry about it.
Please go home, Keith.

43:18.345 --> 43:19.929
Hey, wait a second. Hey.

43:20.097 --> 43:21.973
Who do you think
you're talking to?

43:22.224 --> 43:23.308
Keith, calm down.

43:23.475 --> 43:25.351
You calm down.
Let me tell you something.

43:25.519 --> 43:29.272
That's my son in there too, and I can
take that boy anytime I want. You got that?

43:29.440 --> 43:31.399
Let go of my arm. Let go of my arm.

43:31.567 --> 43:33.985
- What's the matter?
- You should do as she says.

43:35.279 --> 43:36.821
Let go of her arm.

43:37.656 --> 43:39.282
God!

44:08.437 --> 44:11.481
Gosh, I hope that this heals up
before your birthday.

44:11.940 --> 44:14.567
Your friends' parents are going
to think that I beat you.

44:14.735 --> 44:19.238
I don't have to have a party.
Dad says I'm kind of getting old for them.

44:19.406 --> 44:24.327
That is ridiculous. Of course you're gonna
have a party. You only turn 8 once.

44:24.495 --> 44:27.038
You only turn every age once.

44:27.539 --> 44:29.415
Shower. Now.

44:42.346 --> 44:43.388
Thank you for that.

44:43.555 --> 44:45.723
He can't really take Ben away
from you, can he?

44:45.891 --> 44:48.226
You haven't met Keith's father.

44:48.519 --> 44:50.311
Why don't you just leave?

44:51.063 --> 44:55.274
If I tried to take Ben out of Hamden,
I could lose him altogether.

44:55.442 --> 44:58.403
It's none of my business,
but how did you end up...? I mean, what...

44:58.570 --> 45:01.114
What possessed me to marry him?

45:01.281 --> 45:02.448
Picture this:

45:02.616 --> 45:07.328
Senior year, he was captain of the football
team. I thought that I was in love.

45:07.496 --> 45:09.122
Then I got pregnant.

45:09.289 --> 45:11.624
He asked, I said yes.

45:12.835 --> 45:17.296
Only thing is, he didn't quite realize
I expected him to stop dating.

45:18.340 --> 45:20.091
I don't want to go anywhere else.

45:21.051 --> 45:22.218
This is our home.

45:22.970 --> 45:24.595
Has been forever.

45:25.472 --> 45:29.475
Whatever else Keith may be,
he'll always be Ben's dad.

45:31.186 --> 45:33.020
I just want to make sure you're okay.

45:36.108 --> 45:37.275
Thank you.

45:40.487 --> 45:41.904
See you in the morning.

45:46.076 --> 45:48.411
Come on, buddy. Come on.

46:21.153 --> 46:22.320
Hey!

46:24.698 --> 46:26.949
When are we gonna get those beers?

46:27.576 --> 46:29.118
I won't forget.

46:29.953 --> 46:32.747
It's just a casual beer
between coworkers.

46:36.460 --> 46:37.502
It's not a date.

46:37.878 --> 46:40.004
Oh. Did I say anything?

46:51.892 --> 46:55.561
- Do you think life has a plan for you?
- Oh, jeez.

46:58.482 --> 46:59.857
Do you?

47:00.025 --> 47:02.735
If it does, it hasn't shared it with me.

47:04.154 --> 47:05.988
Why did you enlist?

47:06.156 --> 47:07.406
It was the family business.

47:07.574 --> 47:12.078
Oh, I had you figured for a military brat.
Your father was a Marine?

47:12.246 --> 47:13.704
And his dad before him.

47:13.872 --> 47:15.748
So you signed up for them?

47:15.916 --> 47:17.750
The first tour was for them.

47:17.918 --> 47:20.920
The second and third were for the guys
that were still out there.

47:23.465 --> 47:25.007
What time do you think it is?

47:26.260 --> 47:27.593
Am I boring you?

47:29.346 --> 47:31.264
I want to show you something.

47:32.099 --> 47:34.684
Come on. We have to go now.

47:38.939 --> 47:41.148
This is where I come
when I want to be alone.

47:41.316 --> 47:42.692
She's a beauty.

47:42.860 --> 47:44.318
Dad grew up around boats.

47:44.486 --> 47:46.821
He was a vet, but he loved to fish.

47:46.989 --> 47:49.907
Mom was a music teacher.
She couldn't stand it.

47:50.075 --> 47:52.368
You've never mentioned
your parents before.

47:52.536 --> 47:55.663
They died in a car accident
when we were very young.

47:56.915 --> 47:59.458
- Sorry, I was just...
- It's a fair question.

48:00.878 --> 48:03.671
I guess that's why
Drake and I were so close.

48:04.214 --> 48:06.549
We were so lucky to have Nana.

48:16.518 --> 48:19.103
Dad took Drake fishing all the time.

48:22.190 --> 48:27.194
When he taught him how to steer this thing,
he couldn't have been more than 6 or 7.

48:27.362 --> 48:30.907
- What about you?
- Oh.

48:32.910 --> 48:34.619
I love this boat.

48:35.370 --> 48:39.081
I know she doesn't look like much now,
but she could really fly.

48:41.084 --> 48:43.836
- Well, we should take her out sometime.
- Oh.

48:45.172 --> 48:47.423
Can't even get her started now.

48:49.593 --> 48:51.093
That's too bad.

48:57.559 --> 48:59.393
Are you sure you're okay to drive?

49:00.228 --> 49:03.439
I'm perfectly sober,
thank you very much.

49:05.025 --> 49:06.108
Hold on.

49:26.588 --> 49:29.840
You do realize we're gonna
have to do this all again?

49:31.551 --> 49:33.469
You never told me that joke.

49:39.184 --> 49:41.185
Is there any way
I can make it up to you?

50:12.175 --> 50:15.720
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's been so long.

50:17.097 --> 50:18.222
- God.
- It's all right.

50:40.704 --> 50:45.416
You should be kissed every day,
every hour, every minute.

50:55.135 --> 50:56.302
Keith?

50:57.804 --> 50:59.221
Oh, Danny.

50:59.389 --> 51:02.975
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Put that down.

51:03.310 --> 51:05.311
You know y'all were doing 50
through town?

51:05.479 --> 51:07.813
Oh, like hell we were.

51:08.023 --> 51:09.899
Keith put you up to this, didn't he?

51:10.692 --> 51:12.985
- Didn't he?
- Beth, you need to go home.

51:13.153 --> 51:15.905
- Oh.
- Let's just say it never happened.

51:16.073 --> 51:18.240
- No.
- Sorry.

51:18.408 --> 51:20.159
No, it's me that's sorry.

52:34.276 --> 52:36.277
Well, that's as clean as it'll ever be.

52:52.794 --> 52:54.587
Please go.

53:02.596 --> 53:03.929
Oh, shit.

53:15.817 --> 53:17.026
Ben.

53:23.116 --> 53:27.369
You know, you should read this when
I'm done. I think it could really help you.

53:27.871 --> 53:29.163
Who says I need any help?

53:29.331 --> 53:30.789
My undefeated record.

53:30.957 --> 53:32.374
Oh, is that so?

53:32.542 --> 53:35.794
- Guess you're looking for Mom.
- What makes you think that?

53:36.755 --> 53:38.672
She's in the barn.

53:40.842 --> 53:41.884
Ben?

53:42.344 --> 53:43.427
Light.

53:48.975 --> 53:50.267
What are you...?

53:51.478 --> 53:53.812
I just wanted to stop by
and make sure you're okay.

53:56.316 --> 53:58.192
You just wanted to stop by?

54:00.403 --> 54:03.155
- How mysterious.
- Okay.

54:05.700 --> 54:07.660
I wanted to see you.

54:28.807 --> 54:30.099
Mom.

54:30.267 --> 54:31.725
What is it, sweetie?

54:31.893 --> 54:34.103
The ice cream is melting.
Can I just eat it?

54:34.271 --> 54:36.480
Just put it in a bowl first.

54:36.648 --> 54:37.982
Okay.

55:07.804 --> 55:09.221
Feel like some ice cream?

55:12.976 --> 55:14.018
Come on. Yeah.

55:15.603 --> 55:17.438
Let's see what you got.

55:23.862 --> 55:24.945
Yeah.

55:25.447 --> 55:26.530
Come on.

55:33.246 --> 55:35.164
Yeah. Now it... Perfect.

55:35.332 --> 55:36.915
Show me.

55:37.208 --> 55:39.293
Come on. Yeah.

55:39.461 --> 55:40.544
Champion.

56:04.611 --> 56:06.070
Go ahead, say it.

56:06.237 --> 56:07.488
Say what?

56:07.655 --> 56:09.615
Oh, don't be shy.
You know you want to.

56:13.036 --> 56:15.079
"I told you so." There. Feel better?

56:16.373 --> 56:17.831
So you were right.

56:19.793 --> 56:21.668
Only thing is, it's not gonna work out.

56:21.836 --> 56:23.962
No guy could ever be this good.
They never are.

56:24.130 --> 56:26.423
Eventually, it will end.
Things will get awkward.

56:27.801 --> 56:30.677
He'll quit, Ben will be
heartbroken, it will be my fault.

56:30.845 --> 56:35.015
Yeah. And he'll grow up hating you.
He'll move far away, he'll never call.

56:35.183 --> 56:37.393
I'll be dead and you'll be alone.

56:37.977 --> 56:39.353
Forever.

56:47.195 --> 56:48.904
Pick a card, any card.

56:52.534 --> 56:53.617
Tell me when to stop.

56:53.785 --> 56:55.035
Stop.

56:57.705 --> 57:02.584
I know. Just the turkey things, right
on the counter next to the fridge, I think.

57:04.546 --> 57:06.964
Impressive trick.
I'm gonna grab this from you.

57:16.141 --> 57:17.516
Oh!

57:18.685 --> 57:19.852
Excuse me.

57:31.698 --> 57:33.323
What the hell's he doing here?

57:37.704 --> 57:39.329
Ben invited him.

57:39.789 --> 57:41.165
It's his party.

57:48.548 --> 57:51.091
You think I don't know what's going on
around here?

57:59.434 --> 58:01.810
I don't think I like you seeing him.

58:03.480 --> 58:07.900
Well, you don't have a say in it.

58:10.361 --> 58:13.906
I certainly have a say
in who my son sees.

58:17.744 --> 58:22.372
And if I was to say that his mom's
unhealthy relationship...

58:22.540 --> 58:26.376
with some crazy drifter...

58:28.588 --> 58:32.382
was creating an unstable
environment for my boy...

58:36.095 --> 58:40.182
I don't think there's a judge in
the world who'd disagree with me.

58:47.565 --> 58:49.733
Certainly not in this town.

59:24.269 --> 59:26.061
He wants you out of my life.

59:29.315 --> 59:31.483
I can't risk losing Ben.

59:37.532 --> 59:39.241
I'm sorry, Beth.

59:41.578 --> 59:44.246
I didn't come here to make things
harder for you.

59:52.130 --> 59:54.089
You don't know what I'm dealing with.

59:54.841 --> 59:57.843
I do know that you deserve
better than this.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.439
How you doing? You want a ride?

01:00:53.733 --> 01:00:54.858
What do you want?

01:00:55.568 --> 01:00:57.486
I wanna get you a job.

01:00:58.613 --> 01:01:01.323
You gotta be tired of cleaning up
dog shit by now.

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:08.413
I know some people.
I could make a couple calls...

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:11.958
and get you something worthy
of a veteran.

01:01:14.128 --> 01:01:15.212
What do you think?

01:01:18.758 --> 01:01:21.009
You don't know who you're dealing with.

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:24.930
I know exactly who I'm dealing with.
I've known guys like you my whole life.

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:27.933
You think a gun and a badge
and a name make you something.

01:01:28.101 --> 01:01:30.769
- You better watch your mouth.
- I'm done talking to you.

01:01:43.408 --> 01:01:46.284
So are you planning to let him
bully you all your life?

01:01:46.452 --> 01:01:47.953
Excuse me?

01:01:48.413 --> 01:01:49.955
You heard me.

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:57.629
You know, sacrificing everything in life
for our children is...

01:01:58.798 --> 01:02:00.549
It's not selfless. It's...

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:02.300
Well, it's ridiculous.

01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:06.680
I am doing the best that I can.

01:02:07.432 --> 01:02:08.515
Really?

01:02:42.675 --> 01:02:45.927
The power of earth.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:01.860
- Hey.
- You need some help?

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:05.572
Yeah. Grab that rag and start
at the back. I'll meet you in the middle.

01:03:06.574 --> 01:03:10.243
Hey. We're gonna have some pizza
tonight if you wanna stay for dinner.

01:03:10.411 --> 01:03:13.038
You know what, Keith?
That's not gonna work anymore.

01:03:13.748 --> 01:03:17.542
I figured it out. You don't want full custody
any more than I want you to have it.

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:20.128
You can try and take him,
but I will fight you.

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:22.798
I will fight you and your family's lawyers.

01:03:23.007 --> 01:03:26.134
- Okay, calm down.
- I am a damn good mother.

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:28.053
Okay, just...

01:03:28.387 --> 01:03:29.429
You know that.

01:03:29.597 --> 01:03:31.389
Everybody knows that.

01:03:31.557 --> 01:03:33.850
You wanna go back to court,
you just tell me when.

01:03:34.018 --> 01:03:36.561
Otherwise, you stay the
hell out of my life.

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:02.308
Why did you come here?

01:07:05.438 --> 01:07:06.813
To find you.

01:07:22.288 --> 01:07:24.372
Come on.

01:08:00.659 --> 01:08:03.995
Oh, shit. Damn Mary Carlson fell
and broke her wrist, bless her heart.

01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:05.830
Fifty cents to the swear jar, Nana.

01:08:05.998 --> 01:08:07.665
Who's gonna play for the choir now?

01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:10.251
- Probably sound better without her.
- You could do it.

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:11.669
- I could.
- Could you?

01:08:11.837 --> 01:08:13.588
- Maybe.
- Maybe? It's only a few hymns.

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:15.590
- I'm gonna need your help.
- No way.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.175
I can't do it alone, though.

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:20.220
I said I don't wanna do it.

01:08:37.196 --> 01:08:39.072
- Hey, can I join you?
- Sure.

01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:44.702
What if I screw up?

01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:47.913
That's the best part about
performing in a church.

01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:51.917
Forgiving audience. Right?

01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:53.586
I can't get up there alone.

01:08:53.754 --> 01:08:55.421
I need you to be the guy next to me.

01:08:56.215 --> 01:08:57.423
What do you mean?

01:08:57.591 --> 01:08:58.883
It's how Marines work.

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:01.511
We watch each other's backs.

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:04.389
You don't worry about yourself.

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:07.350
You think about the guy next to you.
All right?

01:09:09.103 --> 01:09:10.145
All right.

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:17.318
How many moves do I have left?

01:09:17.486 --> 01:09:18.944
You're done.

01:11:02.174 --> 01:11:03.841
Let's move. Come on.

01:11:09.223 --> 01:11:13.101
Hey, hey. Give it.
Come on, come on. Hey.

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:18.106
And o'er Jesus, Jesus

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:21.442
Precious Jesus

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:28.366
Oh, for grace To trust Him more

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.708
And now, we'll have
a special musical offering.

01:11:36.875 --> 01:11:39.544
- He's so scared.
- He can't play that.

01:12:42.399 --> 01:12:43.941
He can play.

01:13:31.156 --> 01:13:33.324
You know, I had no idea
he could play like that.

01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:36.077
I'm gonna have him play my victory song
come November.

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:37.537
- He'll be ready.
- Thank you.

01:13:37.704 --> 01:13:41.916
I was wondering if you've found anybody to
take over for Julie's class next semester.

01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:44.377
I don't know. Have I?

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:47.755
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:13:51.051 --> 01:13:53.678
Keith. Hey, Keith.

01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:56.848
Remember I told you about that guy
showing Beth's picture around?

01:13:57.015 --> 01:13:59.642
- Yeah, so?
- Yeah, so, that's the guy.

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:15.741
I wanna run home with Zeus.

01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:39.432
What's up?

01:15:24.603 --> 01:15:26.938
- What do you want now, Keith?
- I gotta talk to you.

01:15:27.105 --> 01:15:28.773
It's Sunday night.
Can't this wait?

01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:31.400
No, Beth. Look, this is just
strictly police business.

01:15:31.568 --> 01:15:33.236
Come on, Keith.

01:15:39.284 --> 01:15:40.785
Where did you get that?

01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:44.247
Your boy Logan had it.

01:15:45.832 --> 01:15:47.833
I take it you didn't give it to him.

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:51.837
This was Drake's.

01:16:04.643 --> 01:16:08.062
He didn't wander into town by chance,
Beth.

01:16:08.855 --> 01:16:10.982
He came here to find you.

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:14.652
When he first got here,
he was asking all around about you...

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:16.654
showing that picture to everybody.

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:21.867
You know what they said
about friendly fire...

01:16:22.035 --> 01:16:23.077
No.

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:27.582
I'm not accusing anyone.
I'm just saying that a guy like that...

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:31.460
No friends, no people, just shows up here
with something so personal?

01:16:31.628 --> 01:16:33.754
I mean, now, that just don't
smell right to me.

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:36.007
I've seen stalkers,
I've seen how they think.

01:16:36.174 --> 01:16:38.175
And once they fixate on somebody...

01:16:38.802 --> 01:16:40.511
they're capable of anything.

01:17:15.422 --> 01:17:17.298
- Where did you get this?
- I found it.

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:20.968
This was Drake's. He took it
everywhere with him. He told me.

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:23.012
- Listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:27.058
You didn't come here by accident.

01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:29.060
You came here to find me.

01:17:29.227 --> 01:17:32.938
I know I should have told you.
I tried. I didn't know how.

01:17:35.275 --> 01:17:36.901
Try telling me now.

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:50.247
Move! Move, move, move!

01:17:55.295 --> 01:17:56.921
It was in the morning...

01:17:58.757 --> 01:18:00.591
after a night raid.

01:18:04.179 --> 01:18:06.097
I just found it.

01:18:09.434 --> 01:18:11.435
In the middle of nowhere.

01:18:20.195 --> 01:18:24.281
I tried to find out who lost it.

01:18:25.659 --> 01:18:29.954
I never stopped trying,
but nobody claimed it.

01:18:38.171 --> 01:18:40.339
Finding something like that...

01:18:41.633 --> 01:18:42.925
in a war...

01:18:47.848 --> 01:18:50.433
was like finding an angel in hell.

01:18:56.648 --> 01:18:58.649
So I kept it with me.

01:19:01.486 --> 01:19:03.821
Then I survived a lot of things.

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:09.827
Things that I had no right to.

01:19:12.372 --> 01:19:15.833
I promised myself that if I made it out...

01:19:17.878 --> 01:19:20.212
I would find that girl...

01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:23.382
and thank her...

01:19:24.718 --> 01:19:26.677
for saving my life...

01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:31.056
when others weren't so lucky.

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:36.187
But I couldn't find the words.

01:19:41.902 --> 01:19:47.031
How do you explain something that you
can't even understand yourself?

01:19:47.741 --> 01:19:49.533
Understand this:

01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:51.535
This was Drake's.

01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:54.747
It was meant to keep him alive.

01:19:54.915 --> 01:20:00.878
I wish it had.

01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:06.884
You should go.

01:20:11.723 --> 01:20:12.890
Now.

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:26.403
Logan, wait.

01:20:34.746 --> 01:20:36.497
Oh, man. You sure?

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:38.457
You need it more than I do.

01:20:42.879 --> 01:20:44.797
Take care of your mom, all right?

01:20:50.804 --> 01:20:53.389
I thought I was the guy next to you.

01:21:00.438 --> 01:21:01.522
You're my best buddy.

01:21:04.401 --> 01:21:06.485
I'll always be next to you.

01:21:13.243 --> 01:21:15.494
Tell Zeus I said bye.

01:22:33.406 --> 01:22:34.990
- Here you go.
- You're welcome.

01:22:36.076 --> 01:22:37.701
That's when you know

01:22:37.869 --> 01:22:39.536
I tried to warn her.

01:22:39.871 --> 01:22:44.041
I tried to tell her he was no good.
She didn't wanna listen to me.

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.503
About ready here, bud?

01:22:48.046 --> 01:22:49.964
That's when you know

01:22:50.131 --> 01:22:51.173
Let's do it.

01:22:51.341 --> 01:22:53.634
- You ain't driving nowhere.
- Oh.

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:56.053
- And here's your change.
- Yep.

01:22:56.221 --> 01:22:57.513
- Get your coat.
- All right.

01:22:57.681 --> 01:22:59.139
Appreciate it, J.D.

01:22:59.307 --> 01:23:00.557
Hey, no problem, man.

01:23:00.725 --> 01:23:01.892
Thank you.

01:23:07.023 --> 01:23:08.649
Hey, hang on, man. Stop the car.

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:11.735
- I think you need to let it go...
- Hey, stop the goddamn car!

01:23:11.903 --> 01:23:12.945
He ain't worth it.

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:15.280
Shit.

01:23:15.532 --> 01:23:18.909
Hey. Hey, soldier boy.

01:23:19.536 --> 01:23:21.870
Don't you walk away from me
when I talk to you.

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:35.300
Keith, come on.

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:41.807
You ain't got nothing to say for yourself?

01:23:46.146 --> 01:23:47.312
- Zeus!
- Jesus.

01:23:48.148 --> 01:23:50.357
- Easy, boy. Easy.
- Stand back. Stand back.

01:23:50.525 --> 01:23:51.900
Man, easy.

01:23:52.068 --> 01:23:53.402
- Are you crazy?
- Easy.

01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:56.155
- Come on, Keith. Put it down.
- Shut up.

01:23:56.322 --> 01:23:58.198
Hey. Hang on, bud.

01:23:58.366 --> 01:23:59.992
Hang on.

01:24:05.749 --> 01:24:07.374
You're not a bad guy, Keith.

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:11.795
Zeus.

01:24:13.965 --> 01:24:18.844
Okay, folks. Let's go, let's move along.
Everything's fine.

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:25.809
Could have killed him.

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:29.897
I talked to Sheriff Grey.
He gonna look the other way.

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.320
Now, come on, Keith. Hey.
You pull yourself together now, all right?

01:24:36.988 --> 01:24:41.033
Gonna be fine.

01:24:41.785 --> 01:24:42.868
Yep.

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:47.956
It'll all blow over by the time
the election rolls around.

01:25:07.727 --> 01:25:10.729
You're not the only one whose life
got better when he came here.

01:25:11.606 --> 01:25:16.235
You might not believe it, but I think
he was meant to find that photo.

01:25:16.402 --> 01:25:19.696
Right. Right. Of course.
It was all part of a plan.

01:25:19.864 --> 01:25:23.450
None of us are in control of anything
that happens. It's all down to fate.

01:25:23.618 --> 01:25:27.121
Well, you call it what you like,
but I think it happened for a reason.

01:25:28.748 --> 01:25:31.416
So you're saying...

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:35.963
Drake died so that Logan could live?

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:37.256
No. Honey.

01:25:38.591 --> 01:25:42.302
Oh, sweetheart.
It's not Logan's fault that he survived.

01:26:13.459 --> 01:26:14.543
I'm on it, Aces.

01:26:14.711 --> 01:26:15.752
"Aces"?

01:26:20.758 --> 01:26:23.260
Zeus, stay here. I'll be right back.

01:26:40.987 --> 01:26:42.321
Keith?

01:26:43.239 --> 01:26:44.364
What are you doing?

01:26:52.707 --> 01:26:54.875
I always loved these plates.

01:26:57.378 --> 01:26:59.421
What do you want, Keith?

01:27:00.173 --> 01:27:01.632
What do I want?

01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:04.927
I want...

01:27:09.599 --> 01:27:12.643
I just want us to be a family again.

01:27:13.686 --> 01:27:14.978
Please.

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:18.148
Can we be a family again?

01:27:18.942 --> 01:27:21.902
I can change.

01:27:22.695 --> 01:27:25.113
I have, I've changed.

01:27:26.115 --> 01:27:28.116
I can make you happy, Beth.

01:27:29.452 --> 01:27:31.662
I can. I can make you happy again.

01:27:32.705 --> 01:27:34.081
Keith...

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:39.253
I know you care about Ben...

01:27:42.382 --> 01:27:44.258
but it's not gonna happen for us.

01:27:47.762 --> 01:27:49.513
You have to let it go.

01:27:54.519 --> 01:27:56.103
Let it go.

01:28:03.236 --> 01:28:05.487
Why should I let it go?

01:28:13.579 --> 01:28:17.916
All right, maybe I should just go on
and take Ben, now.

01:28:18.084 --> 01:28:20.711
Take him away for good.

01:28:21.796 --> 01:28:23.797
Can't say I didn't warn you.

01:28:24.674 --> 01:28:26.383
Why don't I just take him
right now?

01:28:26.551 --> 01:28:28.760
Where's he at? Benny.

01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:30.929
- Ben? Ben.
- Ben.

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:32.681
Ben.

01:28:37.562 --> 01:28:38.895
Benny!

01:28:39.105 --> 01:28:40.647
Hey! Come back!

01:28:40.815 --> 01:28:44.401
- He's heading for the tree house.
- Ben! Come back here!

01:28:47.113 --> 01:28:50.198
Ben! Ben!

01:28:51.117 --> 01:28:54.119
Ben! Come back here!

01:28:57.206 --> 01:29:01.877
Benny! Come here!
It's dangerous out there!

01:29:07.133 --> 01:29:08.383
Beth!

01:29:09.093 --> 01:29:10.427
Go with her, Logan!

01:29:12.847 --> 01:29:13.889
Beth!

01:29:15.433 --> 01:29:16.600
Ben!

01:29:17.685 --> 01:29:19.227
Come on! Just walk back to me!

01:29:19.395 --> 01:29:21.897
Walk back to me right here!

01:29:22.065 --> 01:29:24.066
I can't, Dad. It's too shaky.

01:29:24.233 --> 01:29:26.318
Just wait right there, I'm coming to you.

01:29:26.486 --> 01:29:27.819
Dad, I'm scared.

01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:32.491
Ben!

01:29:32.825 --> 01:29:36.787
Help!

01:29:36.954 --> 01:29:39.748
Help! Help me, Dad!

01:29:39.957 --> 01:29:42.250
- Hang on, Ben!
- Help!

01:29:42.418 --> 01:29:44.211
Help!

01:29:44.837 --> 01:29:46.963
- I can't...
- I'm slipping!

01:29:47.131 --> 01:29:48.423
- Help!
- Help me, Dad!

01:29:48.591 --> 01:29:51.176
Help! Dad! No!

01:29:51.344 --> 01:29:52.844
Hold on, Ben!

01:30:00.144 --> 01:30:02.187
Ben! Just stay there!

01:30:02.355 --> 01:30:04.439
I can't, Dad!

01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:08.485
Hang on, buddy, I'm coming!

01:30:08.653 --> 01:30:10.987
- Dad!
- Hang on!

01:30:11.155 --> 01:30:13.698
- Just hang on, I'm coming!
- I can't hold on!

01:30:15.785 --> 01:30:17.160
I got you. I got you.

01:30:17.787 --> 01:30:20.122
- I need you to let go and grab onto me.
- I can't.

01:30:20.289 --> 01:30:21.373
I can't.

01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:23.458
Yeah, you can. Now come on.
You can do it.

01:30:23.626 --> 01:30:25.710
Ben! Ben!

01:30:27.171 --> 01:30:29.047
Keep your arm there.
Just hold on tight.

01:30:29.215 --> 01:30:31.800
- Ben!
- Hold on tight and don't let go.

01:30:31.968 --> 01:30:33.635
You're gonna be all right.

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:35.470
Logan!

01:30:35.638 --> 01:30:36.972
Logan, I need your help!

01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:41.977
Ben! Ben!

01:30:42.145 --> 01:30:43.478
Here comes Logan.

01:30:44.772 --> 01:30:47.732
- I got you.
- Come on. Take him.

01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:50.402
- My leg's caught. Take him.
- I'll come back for you.

01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:52.571
- Dad!
- It's okay. I'm fine.

01:30:58.578 --> 01:31:00.787
- Dad! Dad!
- Almost there.

01:31:02.874 --> 01:31:04.875
I'm gonna go back for Keith.

01:31:05.918 --> 01:31:07.252
No!

01:31:07.962 --> 01:31:09.796
Dad! No!

01:31:19.599 --> 01:31:21.725
Here,
I don't want any problems down there.

01:31:21.893 --> 01:31:25.020
So keep this road clear so we can get
these vehicles out of here.

01:31:25.188 --> 01:31:26.271
Bring it.

01:31:26.439 --> 01:31:29.232
Get back to the bridge,
and make sure it's secure, all right?

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:30.567
You're all good.

01:31:31.402 --> 01:31:32.486
Thank you.

01:31:33.196 --> 01:31:34.404
Take him.

01:31:34.822 --> 01:31:35.947
Okay?

01:31:54.217 --> 01:31:56.384
Thank you for saving Benny.

01:31:57.303 --> 01:31:58.803
I didn't save him.

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.056
Your son did.

01:32:02.642 --> 01:32:03.767
All right.

01:32:06.938 --> 01:32:08.230
I'm sorry.

01:32:22.411 --> 01:32:23.954
Did they find my dad yet?

01:32:31.837 --> 01:32:33.255
How's Ben doing?

01:32:33.422 --> 01:32:35.423
- Does he know?
- No.

01:32:36.842 --> 01:32:38.343
Poor Keith.

01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:42.889
I wish I could have done something more.

01:32:43.349 --> 01:32:45.392
You did a wonderful thing.

01:32:45.601 --> 01:32:47.811
You and Keith did a wonderful thing.

01:32:50.189 --> 01:32:51.898
I'll go get Beth.

01:33:19.677 --> 01:33:20.844
Thank you.

01:33:23.222 --> 01:33:26.766
I came back because I found this
in the book that Ben gave me.

01:33:28.644 --> 01:33:32.314
That's your brother, Drake, isn't it?

01:33:32.732 --> 01:33:33.773
Yeah.

01:33:33.941 --> 01:33:35.525
I know what happened to him.

01:33:38.404 --> 01:33:39.696
I was there.

01:33:40.823 --> 01:33:43.491
What do you mean
that you were there?

01:33:44.285 --> 01:33:47.454
Our platoons crossed paths
during the night raid.

01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:53.293
We were ambushed.

01:33:54.754 --> 01:33:57.172
There was this sergeant
that they called "Aces."

01:34:00.301 --> 01:34:02.218
One of his men got hit.

01:34:04.055 --> 01:34:06.640
He didn't think about himself
for one second.

01:34:07.892 --> 01:34:10.852
He just took care of his man.

01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:15.982
And then I found your picture
the next morning in the rubble outside.

01:34:17.276 --> 01:34:19.361
He must have lost it on the way in.

01:34:25.701 --> 01:34:28.870
I know I've made it hard for you
to believe the truth.

01:34:31.165 --> 01:34:36.002
And I'm sorry for a lot of things,
but nothing more than that.

01:34:43.052 --> 01:34:44.969
I just wanted you to know...

01:34:46.055 --> 01:34:47.597
he didn't die for nothing.

01:35:21.424 --> 01:35:23.258
Logan, wait.

01:35:41.694 --> 01:35:43.403
Don't go.

01:35:52.663 --> 01:35:54.456
You belong here.

01:35:55.624 --> 01:35:56.666
With us.

01:36:24.111 --> 01:36:26.237
Everyone has their own destiny.

01:36:27.364 --> 01:36:30.116
Not everyone makes the choice
to follow it.

01:36:31.327 --> 01:36:32.911
And I'm lucky I did.

01:36:41.670 --> 01:36:44.422
Birthday boy, you old enough to steer?

01:36:44.590 --> 01:36:46.800
Yeah, I am 9, you know.

01:36:46.967 --> 01:36:48.760
Aye, aye, captain.

01:36:49.595 --> 01:36:50.929
Take it easy.

01:37:06.487 --> 01:37:10.198
- Little more left.
- That way. That way.
