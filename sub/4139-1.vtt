02:28.437 --> 02:32.065
In accordance with the regulations
of the state of Mississippi...

02:32.608 --> 02:35.027
...we gather today to lay to rest...

02:35.360 --> 02:39.281
...the remains of inmates
R. Gibson, number 4316...

02:40.616 --> 02:42.659
...and C. Banks, number 4317.

02:44.119 --> 02:47.497
'Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.'

02:48.874 --> 02:51.334
May God have mercy on their souls.

02:51.877 --> 02:53.712
- Amen.
- Amen.

02:54.713 --> 02:56.715
You can go ahead, fellas.

03:04.514 --> 03:07.100
Look like you finally free now, boys.

03:09.936 --> 03:11.438
Finally free.

03:12.314 --> 03:13.899
Friends of yours, old-timer?

03:13.982 --> 03:16.943
Let's just say
we spent some time together.

03:17.277 --> 03:21.948
Now, why do I get the feeling when you
say 'some time,' you mean some time.

03:22.198 --> 03:24.993
I'd been here a good while
when they come.

03:25.493 --> 03:28.038
They come here, must've been 1932.

03:28.496 --> 03:30.957
- Man!
- Shit, that's like... Wait a minute.

03:31.332 --> 03:33.168
That's 65 years, son.

03:33.334 --> 03:34.461
Shit.

03:35.044 --> 03:37.130
Didn't they burn in that fire yesterday?

03:37.213 --> 03:40.633
Listen, man, I seen them niggers
before they put them in the box.

03:40.717 --> 03:43.428
And when I tell you, them niggers,
they was bacon burnt.

03:43.511 --> 03:45.722
It was like from the X Files, man.

03:48.641 --> 03:50.810
What you got in that bottle anyway?

03:51.102 --> 03:53.479
This is Rayford's special recipe.

03:55.315 --> 04:00.111
He had what we call exacting standards
when it comes to the hootch.

04:02.196 --> 04:03.531
- So, what were they, bootleggers?
- Something like that.

04:14.125 --> 04:17.086
- Hank, my man, how you doin'?
- No, not tonight, Ray.

04:17.170 --> 04:20.089
- Spanky's not happy with you.
- Is Spanky here?

04:20.173 --> 04:23.301
Find a place where they let you
in the front door.

04:24.427 --> 04:25.261
Wait.

04:25.344 --> 04:27.722
Remember I bought your girl
the alligator shoes?

04:27.805 --> 04:29.640
What's wrong? I came through for you!

04:29.724 --> 04:33.519
She was wearin' pigskin when I met her.
She's in alligator now. Let me in.

04:33.602 --> 04:35.855
Yeah, that's how it goes, brother.

04:35.938 --> 04:38.316
Thank you, man. I appreciate it.

04:38.441 --> 04:40.985
- How does this tie look?
- Lookin' sharp, man.

04:41.068 --> 04:42.945
I feel lucky tonight, too.

04:55.875 --> 04:59.837
- Here's to your new job down at the bank.
- Thank you.

04:59.879 --> 05:02.673
I always knew you'd make something
of yourself.

05:04.383 --> 05:07.595
- With my first paycheck, I'll buy...
- What, baby?

05:08.762 --> 05:12.433
Season tickets to the Yankees,
right on the first base line.

05:13.142 --> 05:14.101
What's wrong?

05:14.184 --> 05:17.187
I was hoping you were gonna say
an engagement ring, Claude.

05:17.271 --> 05:20.566
- Engagement ring?
- That's what respectable folks do.

05:21.608 --> 05:24.570
Get a job, get married, start having babies.

05:25.946 --> 05:27.823
Isn't that what you want?

05:27.906 --> 05:30.993
I just don't see no reason
to rush into things.

05:31.076 --> 05:34.621
I got to clean this. I'll be right back, baby.

05:48.969 --> 05:52.305
- Good evening, sir.
- Can I have a towel, please?

05:52.472 --> 05:54.474
- Of course.
- Look at this.

05:54.683 --> 05:58.770
Hey, there ain't no reason to get violent.
I tried to call.

05:59.396 --> 06:01.064
Sit your ass down.

06:01.523 --> 06:05.777
Congratulations.
You finally got yourself a job.

06:06.027 --> 06:09.072
Now you can pay Mr. Riley
that 50 bucks you owe him.

06:09.364 --> 06:12.284
- I got a bill to pay out there.
- Lookie here.

06:12.367 --> 06:16.913
- $22.
- Not bad... for a start.

06:17.080 --> 06:20.959
That's two weeks' pay. I'm with my girl.
You gotta leave me something.

06:21.042 --> 06:25.338
- How about your legs?
- My legs? Those are good.

06:26.381 --> 06:27.799
That's good.

06:28.174 --> 06:30.385
I'll keep the legs.

06:33.388 --> 06:34.723
Excuse me.

06:36.015 --> 06:37.517
How'd he get in here?

06:37.600 --> 06:38.601
Evenin'.

06:50.780 --> 06:53.741
- You got any of that French shit?
- Yeah, bro.

06:55.285 --> 06:57.078
That's the one there.

06:57.996 --> 06:59.956
- Thanks, man.
- All right.

07:00.790 --> 07:02.792
- Do I smell French?
- That's it.

07:03.418 --> 07:05.795
- Here, you keep the change.
- Thank you.

07:14.387 --> 07:17.515
- Hey, don't I know you?
- I don't think so.

07:18.057 --> 07:21.686
- Yes, I know you. What is your name?
- Claude Banks.

07:22.270 --> 07:24.939
Claude Banks! Hey, it's me, Ray Gibson.

07:25.773 --> 07:28.150
We went to high school. How you doin'?

07:28.442 --> 07:31.946
- You went to Monroe?
- Yes! How you doing?

07:32.572 --> 07:36.075
You lookin' all sharp.
Good to see colored folks doin' good.

07:36.158 --> 07:38.077
I went to Jefferson.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.413
You must have another Claude Banks
in mind.

07:40.496 --> 07:43.207
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry. My mistake.

07:53.676 --> 07:55.636
Are you wearin' that dress?

07:57.721 --> 07:59.849
Hey, what's goin' on?

08:00.141 --> 08:02.393
Is it about my tab?
Don't worry, it's covered.

08:02.476 --> 08:04.562
It's hot in here tonight. Hot.

08:05.729 --> 08:08.941
This ain't about your tab.
You got bigger problems than that.

08:09.024 --> 08:10.943
Hold up one second...

08:11.026 --> 08:14.071
You shouldn't have run numbers
on Spanky's side of Broadway.

08:14.154 --> 08:17.449
- I think we gotta get out of here.
- Excuse me, sir, your bill.

08:17.533 --> 08:20.995
The bill? Of course, the bill.

08:21.578 --> 08:24.790
How can I forget the bill?
Such an incredibly large bill.

08:31.213 --> 08:33.173
Just tell me where you want me to go.

08:33.256 --> 08:34.424
Get over here.

08:34.508 --> 08:38.679
- You took my ankle.
- All right, that's not nice.

08:39.263 --> 08:40.681
Yeah, right?

08:41.515 --> 08:43.767
What do you think they're gonna do to us?

08:44.268 --> 08:46.895
What'd you do, dine and ditch?

08:46.979 --> 08:48.730
- Over ten bucks?
- Yeah.

08:48.981 --> 08:51.108
- Probably just a thumb.
- Who is he?

08:52.442 --> 08:53.986
Friend of yours?

08:54.069 --> 08:56.029
I never met this man before tonight.

08:56.113 --> 08:59.574
He's a lowlife that hangs around
in bathrooms pickpocketing people.

09:01.076 --> 09:02.577
I'm a professional man.

09:02.661 --> 09:05.163
I got a job that starts on Monday.

09:05.831 --> 09:08.792
I'll pay you back with my first paycheck,
with interest.

09:08.875 --> 09:11.128
I won't tell you how to run your business...

09:11.211 --> 09:14.297
...but if you cut off my fingers,
you won't get nothing.

09:14.422 --> 09:17.843
Working on adding machines,
I got to be whole.

09:18.176 --> 09:20.345
I need these for prayin'!

09:20.637 --> 09:24.099
- Drop him.
- What does 'drop him' mean?

09:25.016 --> 09:27.060
This ain't the way you treat somebody.

09:27.143 --> 09:29.854
Spanky, you ain't got to do that
to that guy.

09:29.938 --> 09:32.649
He's a square.
He didn't know who he was fucking with.

09:33.817 --> 09:35.527
It's filthy down there.

09:35.610 --> 09:38.029
Damn, there's a rat. I hate rats.

09:38.655 --> 09:41.449
But you do.
What does that say about you?

09:42.826 --> 09:44.369
What does that say about me?

09:44.452 --> 09:48.289
I'm just tryin' to get by.
You remember when you started out?

09:48.373 --> 09:49.666
Nigger, please.

09:52.794 --> 09:54.420
Wait a second.

09:55.380 --> 09:58.299
I want you to see this. Check this out.

09:58.383 --> 10:02.512
- I got access to that.
- Is that some more of your bathtub brew?

10:02.637 --> 10:05.265
Hell, no, this come up from the Mississippi.

10:05.348 --> 10:07.892
I can get more. I want to go into business.

10:07.976 --> 10:11.062
Under present circumstances,
I think I may want a partner, OK?

10:11.145 --> 10:13.981
I was supposed to wear this suit
on Monday!

10:15.566 --> 10:18.194
If you give me the front money
and a truck...

10:18.611 --> 10:23.116
...I can get there in two or three days,
if somebody helps me with the driving.

10:26.452 --> 10:30.164
- Come on, now!
- Come on, Spank.

10:36.087 --> 10:38.214
I'm gonna tell you something.

10:38.506 --> 10:43.052
- You fuck me on this, I'll spare no expense.
- I understand.

10:43.511 --> 10:45.221
- Do you hear me?
- I hear you.

10:46.138 --> 10:47.598
- You got a deal.
- All right.

10:47.890 --> 10:49.850
Pick a man and get outta here.

10:50.184 --> 10:52.436
With all due respect to you gentlemen...

10:52.520 --> 10:54.814
...I think I'm gonna just take the choirboy.

10:54.897 --> 10:56.649
You got to be crazy.

10:56.899 --> 11:00.611
At least pick somebody
who can watch your back.

11:00.694 --> 11:03.906
I want someone who won't shoot me
once the truck's full.

11:03.989 --> 11:06.784
- Lift him.
- Not that you'd do that.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.578
- Lift him!
- You know what I mean.

11:11.497 --> 11:12.957
There you go.

11:13.415 --> 11:15.459
Sure he ain't dead?

11:21.882 --> 11:23.592
Sure hope you can drive.

11:28.347 --> 11:32.684
This rum run we're doin' is gonna really
improve my relationship with Spanky.

11:32.851 --> 11:36.897
Good man to have on your side.
He's got capital connections.

11:37.648 --> 11:40.526
I ain't got capital yet, but I will.

11:40.609 --> 11:42.402
Then I'll have my own place.

11:42.486 --> 11:45.364
Don't get me wrong, I like Spanky's.
I want my own.

11:45.447 --> 11:47.407
I'm gonna call my place...

11:47.491 --> 11:49.701
...Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

11:49.952 --> 11:53.497
Don't that sound like a place
where it's fun? Sound excitin'.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.250
Ray's Boom-Boom Room. I like that.

11:57.042 --> 12:00.170
Wouldn't you want to check out
a place like that?

12:00.253 --> 12:02.881
Hell, you'd want to.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.343
The Boom-Boom Room.

12:08.011 --> 12:09.304
What you think?

12:11.973 --> 12:13.934
You ain't said nothin' since we left.

12:14.226 --> 12:16.937
The least you can do is give me
friendly conversation.

12:17.020 --> 12:20.941
I don't want a friendly conversation.
I don't want to be your friend.

12:21.566 --> 12:25.695
I just want to do this thing and get back
to New York in time to start my job.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.906
What the hell kind of job you got?

12:28.114 --> 12:32.494
If you must know,
bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan.

12:35.372 --> 12:36.748
What's so funny?

12:37.082 --> 12:39.584
I'm just laughing at myself. Excuse me.

12:39.668 --> 12:42.796
No, you found something very amusing.
What's so funny?

12:42.921 --> 12:46.925
'Bank teller' just sounds like ladies' work,
I always picture a woman doing that.

12:47.008 --> 12:50.303
Maybe I should dig around
in other people's pockets for money.

12:50.386 --> 12:52.722
It's obviously been highly successful
for you.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.183
You'd be surprised what you find there.

12:55.517 --> 12:58.353
I've never heard of a man
settin' out to be a bank teller.

12:58.436 --> 13:00.855
This time next year, I'll be a loan officer.

13:00.939 --> 13:03.483
So, I go to the bank for a loan...

13:03.566 --> 13:05.568
...I gotta deal with a tight-ass like you?

13:05.652 --> 13:08.154
- That's right.
- Well, how do I get a loan?

13:08.238 --> 13:10.448
- You?
- Yes, me. What's 'you'?

13:10.949 --> 13:12.617
I can't get no money?

13:12.700 --> 13:16.496
- You need collateral.
- What, you think I ain't got collateral?

13:17.372 --> 13:20.917
I have... Look at this. What about this?

13:22.210 --> 13:24.670
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?

13:24.796 --> 13:27.298
I ain't steal that. My daddy gave it to me.

13:27.381 --> 13:29.634
Who'd he steal it from?

13:30.676 --> 13:33.346
Watch what you say about my daddy.
My daddy's dead.

13:33.429 --> 13:36.140
Say what you want about me.
Don't drag my daddy into it.

13:36.224 --> 13:39.602
This watch is sterling silver.
It's top-shelf, top of the line.

13:39.685 --> 13:44.023
It's very near and dear to my heart,
so no wisecracks or I'll whup your ass.

13:45.066 --> 13:47.693
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied.

13:48.694 --> 13:51.614
Fuck you. I'll take my business elsewhere.

13:51.697 --> 13:55.409
And for future references, you will not
be welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

13:55.493 --> 13:58.537
- There's no Boom-Boom Room.
- When there is one.

13:58.621 --> 14:02.458
When there's one, don't come,
'cause you ain't gettin' in.

14:21.852 --> 14:24.438
- Smell that?
- Yeah, I smell something.

14:24.521 --> 14:28.567
- Smells good, right?
- I think we should go to another place.

14:29.234 --> 14:31.528
The ambiance ain't really very welcoming.

14:31.612 --> 14:35.866
Are you kiddin'? Tell me you don't want
one of these pies right here.

14:35.991 --> 14:38.452
Them pies look good,
but I kinda lost my appetite.

14:38.535 --> 14:41.872
- When I came in, my appetite left.
- Good afternoon, Billy.

14:43.082 --> 14:45.918
We'd like some coffee
and a couple slices of pie.

14:46.126 --> 14:48.295
How do you know my name is Billy?

14:49.588 --> 14:52.508
It says it right there on your shirt.

14:53.217 --> 14:57.930
If you boys can read so good, how come
you missed that sign on the door?

15:00.682 --> 15:02.267
That sign on the door...

15:02.351 --> 15:05.270
Why didn't we see that sign
that say 'No Coloreds Allowed'?

15:05.354 --> 15:07.898
We rushed in.
We was really hungry, so we missed it.

15:07.981 --> 15:10.025
- We see it now, so bye.
- Look, ma'am...

15:10.108 --> 15:12.361
...we've been traveling all day.
- Let's go.

15:12.444 --> 15:16.073
All we want is some coffee
and a couple slices of pie, all right?

15:16.156 --> 15:18.909
No. These are whites-only pies.

15:20.077 --> 15:23.997
- Well, do you have any Negro pies?
- Claude, come on.

15:24.623 --> 15:27.751
This woman ain't got the recipe to it.
Where would she get that?

15:27.834 --> 15:30.295
At another establishment
we can get us some pies.

15:30.378 --> 15:32.839
- How far to the next town?
- Thirty-five miles.

15:32.923 --> 15:36.134
I'm not driving no 35 miles to get no pie.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.261
Lady! Ma'am! Okay?

15:39.304 --> 15:42.265
Now we want some pie. We are hungry.

15:43.224 --> 15:45.268
Billy, we want some pie.

15:45.393 --> 15:48.730
- Let me take care of this.
- Someone must die 'cause we want pie?

15:48.813 --> 15:51.232
Let me take care of 'em.

15:51.358 --> 15:54.069
We're from New York,
my name's Ray Gibson.

15:56.071 --> 16:00.116
How much will it cost to turn one of them
white-only pies into nigger pie?

16:00.200 --> 16:02.911
How about I turn y'all into nigger pie?

16:03.077 --> 16:05.538
- So you said about 35...
- 35 miles.

16:05.622 --> 16:08.791
We'll find another establishment
down the road.

16:09.209 --> 16:12.795
Yeah, I didn't know white folks
so serious about pie down here.

16:27.977 --> 16:30.646
- Hey, we're lookin' for Slim.
- You found him.

16:33.483 --> 16:37.278
That's it, fellas.
Thirty-six cases of Mississippi's finest.

16:39.322 --> 16:43.075
- Five bucks a case. That's $180.
- All right.

16:43.159 --> 16:45.745
- What do we got?
- Come on. Pay the man.

16:47.622 --> 16:50.207
That music's hot.
What goes on down there?

16:50.499 --> 16:52.835
That there's Natchez-Under-The-Hill.

16:52.919 --> 16:54.754
Colored folks welcome down there?

16:54.837 --> 16:58.007
- Green's the only color that matters there.
- Is that right?

16:58.299 --> 17:00.301
They got gambling, girls.

17:02.136 --> 17:05.931
- You boys ought to check it out.
- Maybe we will. Nice doing business...

17:06.015 --> 17:08.642
Let's go have ourselves a reward,
see what's shaking.

17:08.726 --> 17:11.686
- Reward?
- There's people there having a good time.

17:11.771 --> 17:14.272
I wanna be one of 'em.
I want you to be one of 'em.

17:14.356 --> 17:18.277
Let me tell you something. Listen.
Monday, you can go be a bank teller.

17:18.359 --> 17:21.614
Tonight, you're a bootlegger
with a truckload of hootch...

17:21.946 --> 17:23.531
...and a fistful of cash.

17:24.032 --> 17:25.910
That's gas money, Ray.

17:26.492 --> 17:28.119
Come on. Think.

17:29.830 --> 17:33.250
Man, you are incredible. Tell you what.
Here's $2.

17:33.334 --> 17:36.295
You stay here, watch the truck.
I'm gonna go have fun.

17:36.378 --> 17:38.881
I got the keys,
if you want to leave me in the woods.

17:38.964 --> 17:41.759
I know how you think, you motherfucker.

17:45.220 --> 17:46.889
This looks like something here.

17:48.348 --> 17:51.685
I'll keep an eye on you.
Make sure you don't do nothin' stupid.

17:51.769 --> 17:53.437
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

17:53.770 --> 17:57.232
Well, step lively.
Don't want them to think I'm from here.

17:57.316 --> 18:00.110
They'll know by how I walk,
I ain't from around here.

18:00.194 --> 18:01.904
'Cause I'm from New York City!

18:01.987 --> 18:04.489
- How y'all doing?
- What's up, country boy?

18:12.414 --> 18:13.999
Tens over nines.

18:29.347 --> 18:31.975
I ain't never seen you in here before.

18:32.559 --> 18:35.312
That's 'cause I ain't never been
in here before.

18:35.395 --> 18:37.898
My name's Sylvia. What's your name?

18:41.109 --> 18:45.071
- Can't you remember your own name?
- I know it begins with a 'C.'

18:45.947 --> 18:47.949
Well, Mr. 'C.'

18:50.160 --> 18:53.121
How about buyin' a gal a drink?
Two bourbons.

18:54.622 --> 18:58.293
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep
an eye on my friend over there.

18:58.710 --> 19:01.504
He look like he can take care of hisself.

19:32.118 --> 19:33.327
Claude.

19:36.622 --> 19:38.624
That's my name... Claude.

19:39.041 --> 19:41.669
You know that's never
happened to me before.

19:43.254 --> 19:44.630
You're cute.

19:46.799 --> 19:48.134
Thank you.

19:49.802 --> 19:51.596
You got any money, Claude?

19:53.347 --> 19:56.100
Two dollars, but I need that to get home.

19:59.228 --> 20:00.688
What's wrong?

20:01.230 --> 20:03.232
What you wanna go home for?

20:04.984 --> 20:06.485
It's so early.

20:08.279 --> 20:09.780
I'll take one.

20:09.864 --> 20:13.701
- One for New York.
- Thank you. Me's want one.

20:13.993 --> 20:15.953
- Can I get that for you?
- Thanks, baby.

20:16.036 --> 20:18.664
- Give me a deuce.
- Here you go, honey.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.835
- Thank you.
- All right.

20:23.043 --> 20:26.630
- You all want to pick up this country pace?
- Bet's to you, sir.

20:29.925 --> 20:32.136
- Bet a dollar.
- I'll sees that.

20:33.804 --> 20:35.306
You sees that.

20:35.431 --> 20:38.892
Well, I sees that dollar, and I raise you $2.

20:39.852 --> 20:41.478
Is 'sees' a word?

20:42.479 --> 20:44.398
- All right now.
- I'm out.

20:44.732 --> 20:47.985
You goin' back to the farm now?
Pick your tomatoes?

20:51.363 --> 20:52.990
I'll see the two.

20:56.493 --> 20:57.911
And I raise you ten.

20:57.995 --> 20:59.371
Damn. Out.

21:05.627 --> 21:08.797
Mr. Hancock, I don't think
I have any more money.

21:10.966 --> 21:13.468
- Big city boy.
- Well, that's too bad.

21:14.678 --> 21:16.138
Now, hold on.

21:16.847 --> 21:18.849
Just give me two seconds.

21:39.786 --> 21:41.121
Top shelf.

21:41.913 --> 21:43.498
It look good to me.

21:44.040 --> 21:45.792
I think that'll cover it.

21:46.376 --> 21:47.335
Call.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.886
I got a full boat
with the ladies doin' the paddlin'.

21:57.721 --> 22:01.266
I don't think they come in
much stronger than that, sir.

22:02.308 --> 22:03.768
Four treys.

22:05.687 --> 22:07.188
What the fuck?

22:08.815 --> 22:10.233
Broke again.

22:10.567 --> 22:12.277
New York. New York.

22:13.611 --> 22:17.323
Don't take it too hard, New York.
Have a round on me.

22:25.790 --> 22:28.626
- Can I get you something, sir?
- No, I'm all right.

22:28.710 --> 22:30.837
Hey! What the fuck is this?

22:31.421 --> 22:34.716
- You're hurtin' my arm.
- Where you goin'?

22:35.633 --> 22:37.844
Hell, no! Hey, Hancock!

22:44.851 --> 22:46.102
Oh, shit.

23:09.166 --> 23:10.543
My goodness.

23:11.836 --> 23:14.714
My old friend, Winston Hancock.

23:17.383 --> 23:20.594
I thought we agreed that
you was gonna leave town.

23:24.223 --> 23:26.642
I was gonna leave, Sheriff Pike...

23:28.477 --> 23:31.105
...but your wife, she begged me to stay.

23:54.086 --> 23:56.338
You just committed suicide, boy.

23:59.633 --> 24:02.136
Ray, I've been lookin' for ya.

24:06.723 --> 24:09.017
Guess we better get goin'.

24:11.520 --> 24:13.772
You still got that $2?

24:15.023 --> 24:16.191
Not exactly.

24:16.608 --> 24:18.068
I met this girl.

24:18.151 --> 24:20.904
Real nice girl. A God-fearing girl.

24:21.905 --> 24:24.574
- The same girl I seen you over here with?
- Yeah.

24:24.658 --> 24:27.494
- Yeah, she looked religious.
- Yeah, well...

24:28.787 --> 24:30.789
So you gave her the $2?

24:30.872 --> 24:33.583
She was in a tight spot.
Her mama needs this operation.

24:33.667 --> 24:36.503
She ain't have the money for it, and so...

24:37.087 --> 24:40.173
The church took up a collection,
but they're short...

24:40.549 --> 24:42.759
- $2 short?
- Uh, yeah.

24:43.552 --> 24:46.012
So I gave it to her.
When the spirit moves me...

24:46.096 --> 24:49.057
We both got fucked.
While you was doing God's work...

24:49.140 --> 24:53.061
...I was getting jack-legged by a farmer
and one of these waitresses.

24:53.144 --> 24:56.439
I know the bitch is in here.
They beat me down to my socks.

24:56.523 --> 24:58.817
You lost all our money in a card game?

24:58.900 --> 25:02.821
Fuck the money. It's not even about
the money. I lost my daddy's watch.

25:02.904 --> 25:05.073
Fuck that cheap-ass watch.

25:06.157 --> 25:08.910
I apologize. You're right, it has to stop.

25:09.160 --> 25:12.205
Once more, I'll take all your fronts out.

25:12.288 --> 25:14.457
See how you go back to New York.

25:14.541 --> 25:17.293
- That's how you gonna be in the car.
- I'm sorry.

25:17.377 --> 25:19.462
Say something about the watch.

25:19.546 --> 25:24.425
In fact, just bring up watch. Look like you
was fixin' your mouth to say 'watch.'

25:24.843 --> 25:27.178
I'm gonna whup your ass.
Don't even say 'watch.'

25:27.262 --> 25:31.724
Don't say it around me. Say 'little clock'
or some shit. Say 'watch,' I'm gonna dive.

25:31.808 --> 25:33.726
How do we get home without money?

25:33.810 --> 25:36.813
We got 36 cases of booze.
That's better than money.

25:37.313 --> 25:39.565
So we gonna drive home drunk.

25:39.649 --> 25:41.401
- Is that it?
- Let me pay, get out.

25:41.484 --> 25:43.528
- Where's the girl who was here?
- What girl?

25:43.611 --> 25:48.074
'What girl? ' Next time I come here,
whichever bitch I start choking, that's her.

25:48.950 --> 25:53.079
Big-time hustler, came and got girked
by a couple of farmers.

25:53.788 --> 25:56.999
Can it, Claude. I'm all shot,
I just wanna get back to New York.

26:01.003 --> 26:02.463
Oh, shit.

26:04.006 --> 26:06.425
I think he's hurt pretty bad.

26:16.185 --> 26:18.229
This guy's dead.

26:19.105 --> 26:21.524
I ain't never seen no dead body before.

26:21.857 --> 26:26.612
What are you doin'? The man's been dead
two seconds, and you're in his pocket.

26:27.154 --> 26:29.406
- Don't you have any respect?
- It ain't here.

26:29.490 --> 26:32.910
- What ain't there?
- My daddy's watch. He took my watch.

26:33.077 --> 26:35.663
Motherfucker, you fucked
with the wrong person.

26:35.746 --> 26:38.457
- Now look at your ass out here bleeding.
- Hey!

26:39.375 --> 26:41.585
What you boys doin' out here?

26:43.128 --> 26:44.713
Hey, how y'all doin'?

26:46.173 --> 26:48.759
We're just takin' care of our friend here.

26:48.926 --> 26:51.053
What's wrong with this one?

26:51.679 --> 26:54.139
- Drink.
- Yeah, he's just a little drunk.

26:54.223 --> 26:57.434
- Nothing at all, just a little drunk.
- Nobody drank like old...

26:57.518 --> 26:59.228
- Ah, Winston.
...Winston.

26:59.311 --> 27:02.856
Old drunk-ass Winston is always drinking.

27:02.940 --> 27:05.025
This fella looks like he's dead.

27:05.192 --> 27:06.193
No.

27:07.611 --> 27:09.238
He's not dead. He's drunk.

27:09.321 --> 27:11.156
He drinks until he passes out.

27:11.240 --> 27:13.909
Let's leave him here to sleep it off.

27:13.992 --> 27:16.328
I'm gonna tell his wife we left him.

27:16.411 --> 27:19.456
- Let's go to the car.
- You boys better come with us.

27:19.790 --> 27:21.250
That's right.

27:21.792 --> 27:24.378
We're gonna go to your car then.

27:24.461 --> 27:27.005
Let's go. We're gonna go with this guy.

27:27.714 --> 27:29.466
You know what, Ray?

27:29.841 --> 27:32.761
You're responsible for this whole situation.

27:32.844 --> 27:35.555
I blame you for everything.

27:36.181 --> 27:39.309
If it wasn't for you,
I'd be home now about to have a hot meal.

27:39.393 --> 27:42.521
If not for me, your black ass
would be floating up on a beach.

27:42.604 --> 27:45.273
Remember that, 'my finger
and thumbs for adding' shit?

27:45.357 --> 27:48.151
- I saved your life.
- They think we killed somebody.

27:48.235 --> 27:51.029
- This is blood, okay?
- Just shut up. Listen.

27:51.112 --> 27:53.031
Just sit down. Let me work it out.

27:53.114 --> 27:55.575
- I got a job, it starts Monday.
- You'll be late.

27:55.659 --> 27:59.287
- 'Cause I got to work this whole thing out.
- What the...

28:00.830 --> 28:03.583
- Evening, boys.
- Evening there, Sheriff.

28:06.211 --> 28:08.838
Well, well. What do we have here?

28:09.130 --> 28:13.385
Billy Bob and the boys found 'em
under the hill with Winston Hancock.

28:14.386 --> 28:17.514
He was dead. Looks like murder.

28:18.890 --> 28:20.433
- Yep, it does.
- Is that right?

28:20.517 --> 28:24.270
Looks like they was runnin' hootch.
Got 36 cases of evidence.

28:24.479 --> 28:27.816
- How about a little reward, Billy Bob?
- Thank you, sir.

28:29.943 --> 28:34.197
Why bother with bootleggin' when we got
a clear-cut case of murder?

28:36.199 --> 28:39.327
Sheriff Pike, like I told your associate,
we didn't kill nobody.

28:39.410 --> 28:42.246
He was like that when we found him.
He was already dead.

28:42.330 --> 28:44.749
Now as far as bootleggin' goes...

28:45.583 --> 28:48.878
...I happen to work for a very important
man back East.

28:50.588 --> 28:53.800
Does the name Spanky Johnson
mean anything to you?

28:54.008 --> 28:55.885
Spanky Johnson?

28:57.637 --> 29:00.056
- No, I'm afraid not.
- Hey, Sheriff Pike.

29:00.139 --> 29:02.350
Sheriff Pike, listen.

29:04.060 --> 29:07.230
This guy, Spanky Johnson,
is very well-connected.

29:07.480 --> 29:10.942
Very well-connected.
And if you were to give us a break...

29:11.317 --> 29:15.112
...I can guarantee you, he would do
something to show his appreciation.

29:15.488 --> 29:17.448
- Now I'm sure.
- Mr. Pike.

29:18.950 --> 29:22.161
You can buy your way out of trouble
in New York City...

29:22.244 --> 29:25.164
...but down here,
we take murder very seriously.

29:25.748 --> 29:28.667
We didn't kill him.
He was dead when we found him.

29:29.752 --> 29:30.836
That's the truth.

29:30.920 --> 29:32.713
The liquor was ours.

29:32.922 --> 29:36.717
- There was no breath in him.
- It was our liquor, but the man was dead.

29:36.801 --> 29:39.929
If that's true, you boys don't have anything
to worry about.

29:40.012 --> 29:42.848
I guarantee it. I'll see y'all in the morning.

29:42.932 --> 29:46.393
You believe us? What time
you gonna be here in the mornin'?

29:46.477 --> 29:50.314
- Don't drink all that stuff tonight.
- All right, Sheriff.

29:51.023 --> 29:54.610
- See you in the morning.
- He sounded like he believed us.

29:54.985 --> 29:57.946
The man's got a point.
We didn't kill nobody.

29:58.030 --> 30:00.366
What about the truckload of booze?

30:00.449 --> 30:02.701
That's Spanky's booze!

30:02.785 --> 30:06.538
Tomorrow, I'm gonna tell that judge,
'Judge, we didn't murder nobody.

30:06.622 --> 30:08.624
'That was Spanky's booze.'

30:09.166 --> 30:11.960
What's the worst that can happen to us?

30:12.377 --> 30:13.420
Life!

30:13.712 --> 30:16.799
What do you mean, 'life'?
I ain't doin' no life.

30:21.011 --> 30:24.223
I didn't kill nobody.
The man was dead when I got there.

30:53.543 --> 30:55.420
Welcome to Mississippi.

30:55.921 --> 30:58.882
Here, you will be provided
with ample opportunity...

30:58.965 --> 31:02.886
...to repay your debt to society
through the rigors of hard labor.

31:04.429 --> 31:09.351
We got fields need clearin', roads need
buildin' and ditches need diggin'.

31:10.352 --> 31:12.854
You will eat only what you can grow.

31:13.021 --> 31:15.732
Your crop don't come in, you go hungry.

31:16.816 --> 31:18.610
This here is Camp 8.

31:20.820 --> 31:22.947
Camp 8 is for incorrigibles.

31:23.406 --> 31:26.576
But whatever you done to get here,
believe me, I'm not impressed.

31:26.659 --> 31:28.620
I've seen it all before.

31:30.663 --> 31:33.291
We ain't got no fences here at Camp 8.

31:33.750 --> 31:37.462
We don't need no fences.
We got us the gun line.

31:37.545 --> 31:38.796
Tell 'em about the gun line, boss.

31:39.547 --> 31:41.341
This is the gun line.

31:42.383 --> 31:45.553
It runs from shack to shack,
clear around the yard.

31:48.723 --> 31:51.017
You are now inside the gun line.

31:52.602 --> 31:56.856
You step outside the gun line
without my permission, you will be shot.

31:57.357 --> 32:01.444
You trip and fall over the gun line,
you will be shot.

32:01.986 --> 32:03.821
You spit, you pee...

32:03.988 --> 32:07.658
...you so much as stick
your Johnson out over the gun line...

32:07.867 --> 32:09.619
...you will be shot.

32:11.954 --> 32:16.209
And you, Slick,
don't try to run, don't try to escape.

32:17.335 --> 32:20.546
One of my trusties
will put a bullet in your head.

32:22.924 --> 32:26.802
You prisoners are now the property
of the state of Mississippi...

32:27.386 --> 32:30.264
...which is to say I own your ass.

32:30.681 --> 32:33.559
And in case you haven't met this
handsome young fella...

32:33.642 --> 32:35.519
...this is Hoppin' Bob.

32:35.728 --> 32:39.190
You run afoul of Bob, you run afoul of me.

32:42.777 --> 32:44.945
Everybody, shut up! Right now.

32:45.029 --> 32:48.324
I don't wanna hear a sound.
Got some fresh meat for ya.

32:48.407 --> 32:51.577
Right there. Take yourself right there,
find your ass a bunk.

32:51.660 --> 32:53.787
Move it. Actin' all scared.

32:55.956 --> 32:58.792
We ain't got no wallflowers in Camp 8.

33:00.669 --> 33:02.588
Don't y'all worry none.

33:02.671 --> 33:05.466
Ain't nobody gonna mess with ya tonight.

33:05.799 --> 33:08.552
That'd take all the fun out the courtship.

33:09.345 --> 33:10.721
You hear me, boy?

33:11.638 --> 33:16.143
I didn't see nothing special the first time
Ray and Claude walked into the cage.

33:16.643 --> 33:20.522
To me, they were just a couple of fools
whose luck had run out.

33:21.565 --> 33:23.901
'Course, I was wrong about that.

33:56.183 --> 33:58.894
I don't believe this 'before Abe' shit.

34:00.395 --> 34:03.315
I didn't go to night school to dig no ditch.

34:06.401 --> 34:08.737
What are you doing? I wouldn't do that.

34:08.820 --> 34:12.489
Shut up. What do you know anyway?
It's too damn hot.

34:13.116 --> 34:17.203
- Why ain't that boy's pick swingin'?
- Why ain't that pick swingin'?

34:17.536 --> 34:19.539
Why ain't that pick swingin', nigger?

34:19.621 --> 34:22.500
It's too hot. I'm tired, boss.

34:23.251 --> 34:25.962
He said he's too hot, boss. He's tired.

34:26.795 --> 34:29.047
Too hot? He's tired?

34:30.091 --> 34:33.428
You tell that lazy jigaboo
the state of Mississippi...

34:33.511 --> 34:36.764
...ain't interested
in his meteorological assessments!

34:36.931 --> 34:38.683
Listen up, jigaboo!

34:38.933 --> 34:42.228
The state of Mississippi
ain't interested in your...

34:43.730 --> 34:46.149
...your 'metacalogical' assessments!

34:46.774 --> 34:50.069
You tell him the state of Mississippi
is only interested...

34:50.152 --> 34:52.655
...in gettin' this here ditch cleared
by sundown.

34:52.739 --> 34:57.160
State of Mississippi wants this here ditch
cleared by sundown. Got that?

34:58.286 --> 35:00.371
Got it, boss.

35:02.415 --> 35:06.210
- He don't sound like he from around here.
- He from New York City, boss.

35:06.294 --> 35:08.045
That one there too.

35:08.296 --> 35:10.840
They'll find we do things different here.

35:11.382 --> 35:13.009
Yeah, we noticed.

35:16.137 --> 35:20.183
Don't smart me, boy.
Just shut your mouth and do your work.

35:26.230 --> 35:28.691
Looks like we got a couple of live ones.

35:28.774 --> 35:32.737
- How long these boys in for?
- The judge gave 'em the long ride, boss.

35:32.987 --> 35:34.322
Life, huh?

35:34.947 --> 35:39.160
They step out of line again,
we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.

35:41.495 --> 35:45.040
Get them picks a-swinging!
You heard me, New York Cities.

35:46.125 --> 35:48.085
You don't want me to come down there.

35:48.169 --> 35:52.381
I ain't nice like Boss.
I'll slap the black off your ass.

35:52.965 --> 35:54.383
Get to work!

36:00.014 --> 36:02.892
Either one of you new fellas
know how to read?

36:03.058 --> 36:04.643
I know how to read. Why?

36:04.727 --> 36:07.021
I've been carrying this letter
for four months.

36:07.104 --> 36:09.106
You mean none of y'all can read?

36:09.189 --> 36:12.693
Last fella that could read
made parole around Christmas.

36:13.694 --> 36:16.113
I don't even know who this come from.

36:16.780 --> 36:18.240
Give me this.

36:19.032 --> 36:20.534
You can't read?

36:22.119 --> 36:24.621
Almost 60 years old,
motherfucker can't read.

36:25.747 --> 36:28.375
It's from your mama's neighbor,
Mrs. Tadwell.

36:28.459 --> 36:29.585
You know who?

36:29.668 --> 36:32.713
She thought you ought to know
your second cousin, Bo, died.

36:32.796 --> 36:37.426
Bo died. And your cousin,
Sally, on your daddy's side, she died.

36:38.510 --> 36:41.430
- And apparently your sister died too.
- Jenny?

36:41.763 --> 36:44.266
No, it say Marleen here. Marleen died.

36:44.349 --> 36:46.893
Oh, no. Jenny died too.

36:47.060 --> 36:49.021
Jenny and Marleen both dead.

36:49.104 --> 36:53.859
It goes on for a while about how the crop
didn't come in on account of the frost.

36:55.277 --> 36:58.613
She ends saying there was a big tornado...

36:58.697 --> 37:01.366
...in which your mama and daddy
were both killed.

37:01.616 --> 37:04.411
Don't worry,
'cause she gonna take care of the dog.

37:04.494 --> 37:07.706
That is, if he gets over the worms.
Dog had worms.

37:08.790 --> 37:12.294
- Appreciate it.
- Yeah, you know, anytime I can help out.

37:13.962 --> 37:16.673
Anybody else got something
they want read?

37:17.340 --> 37:18.842
Can't blame y'all.

37:24.180 --> 37:26.516
- How ya doin'?
- I'm fine, thanks.

37:27.017 --> 37:28.768
Good. First time in?

37:30.854 --> 37:32.147
Nah, not at all.

37:32.230 --> 37:35.066
I've been in and out of prison, mostly in.

37:36.568 --> 37:39.237
So you won't have no problem adjusting?

37:39.946 --> 37:42.157
Shouldn't have a problem, no.

37:42.282 --> 37:44.242
If you need anything...

37:44.909 --> 37:47.495
...of any kind, give me a holler.

37:48.329 --> 37:50.748
My name's Jangle Leg.

37:51.291 --> 37:55.003
- I appreciate it. Jangle Leg?
- Jangle Leg, Jangle Leg.

37:55.628 --> 37:58.131
- I'm Claude.
- Claude.

37:58.798 --> 38:01.467
Your hand nice and supple, like a lady.

38:04.053 --> 38:08.474
Jangle Leg! What the hell I tell you
about pitchin' woo on the job, boy?

38:12.520 --> 38:13.646
Sorry, Cap'n.

38:13.729 --> 38:17.733
Story time is over.
All you sissies get back to work right now.

38:24.866 --> 38:27.368
- He made a pass at me.
- Yeah, I see.

38:28.578 --> 38:31.414
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?

38:31.664 --> 38:34.000
You're gonna find out before me.

38:41.132 --> 38:43.718
- Eyes front, mister.
- Everybody doing that.

38:49.265 --> 38:50.641
I'm hungry.

39:06.240 --> 39:09.660
- See how you get that off?
- Eat and stop aggravating people.

39:09.743 --> 39:11.578
I ain't aggravating nobody.

39:11.662 --> 39:14.915
You got nerve, scraping toast and shit,
making excess noise.

39:14.999 --> 39:18.460
- You're making a lotta noise there.
- The spoon, it's filthy.

39:19.086 --> 39:21.964
- Filthy, ain't it?
- Fuck that spoon and just eat.

39:22.548 --> 39:25.592
- I'm Ray Gibson, this is Claude Banks.
- Willie Long.

39:27.636 --> 39:30.848
- You seem sensible. Why you in here?
- It's a long story.

39:30.931 --> 39:33.517
At 13, he killed a son of a bitch
with a claw hammer.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.686
- So they say.
- A lot of people say it.

39:35.769 --> 39:39.314
- Wait, you been in here since you were 13?
- That's right.

39:39.648 --> 39:41.650
How about you? How long you been here?

39:41.733 --> 39:45.112
- He chopped his sister with an axe.
- She was my half-sister...

39:45.195 --> 39:48.365
...so I cut her ass in half,
but I didn't poison my ma and pa.

39:48.448 --> 39:51.201
- Now tell that. Tell that.
- They deserved it, Radio.

39:51.285 --> 39:54.496
What you talkin' about?
You skinned your landlady alive...

39:54.579 --> 39:56.748
...and made a jacket out of her.

39:56.832 --> 39:59.084
Well, at least he didn't kill Santa Claus.

39:59.167 --> 40:01.086
Santa? Which one of you killed him?

40:01.169 --> 40:04.840
It wasn't Santa Claus. He was just
wearing the suit and ringing a bell.

40:04.923 --> 40:06.883
- He had presents.
- I ain't get nothing.

40:06.967 --> 40:10.262
You killed a Salvation man,
the dude on the street with the bell?

40:10.345 --> 40:12.180
- Something like that.
- He did.

40:12.264 --> 40:13.640
Nobody tried to escape?

40:13.723 --> 40:17.519
- They never get too far.
- Cookie got to Greenville a few years ago.

40:17.686 --> 40:20.897
Take a mighty cagey country boy
to navigate the woods.

40:20.981 --> 40:22.899
Gotta know what you're doin'.

40:23.733 --> 40:25.360
What'd y'all do?

40:27.862 --> 40:29.864
What the fuck did y'all do?

40:32.617 --> 40:34.869
- We went on...
- The most violent...

40:34.953 --> 40:36.454
...a violent killing spree.

40:36.538 --> 40:39.124
All around the country
we've been killing people.

40:39.207 --> 40:42.085
All month. If y'all was out
and reading the papers...

40:42.168 --> 40:44.504
Ain't heard about it? Claude and Ray?

40:45.296 --> 40:47.799
Sometimes you got to do certain shit...

40:47.882 --> 40:52.053
- He'd cut your throat.
- I go where I need to go to get it done.

40:52.303 --> 40:55.306
If you push my button,
there's no telling what I may do...

40:55.390 --> 40:57.559
...stab you, choke you, bite you.

40:57.642 --> 41:00.895
I'd do whatever it takes to make
a motherfucker stop existing.

41:00.979 --> 41:03.022
I could stab a nigger right now.

41:03.106 --> 41:05.817
I beat a motherfucker to death.
Don't fuck with us.

41:05.900 --> 41:08.361
You don't really wanna fuck with us.

41:08.861 --> 41:10.822
Press the wrong button, nigger pop.

41:10.905 --> 41:13.783
Hey, girl. You gonna eat your corn bread?

41:15.243 --> 41:17.870
- Oh, trouble.
- Don't say nothin' to him.

41:20.373 --> 41:21.874
You talkin' to me?

41:22.166 --> 41:24.293
Yeah, I think he's talking to you.

41:25.044 --> 41:27.672
No, not at all. I want you to have it.

41:28.756 --> 41:30.842
Willie, you mind passing this down to...

41:30.925 --> 41:33.636
No. Don't pass your corn bread to him.

41:33.844 --> 41:36.347
- That's your corn bread.
- I'm a grown man.

41:36.430 --> 41:39.809
I'm not gonna eat this.
If he wants the corn bread, have it.

41:39.892 --> 41:43.104
If he wants corn bread,
let him up to the front and get his own.

41:43.187 --> 41:45.356
That's your corn bread. Fuck him.

41:45.439 --> 41:47.817
He gonna eat his corn bread. Fuck you.

41:48.109 --> 41:50.903
I don't need you to take up for me.

41:51.529 --> 41:53.614
I'm a grown man. I can handle it.

41:53.697 --> 41:56.742
If you let him have it,
you'll be ironing his drawers.

41:56.826 --> 42:00.830
- I ain't gonna be ironing.
- Maybe I ought to eat your corn bread.

42:01.497 --> 42:04.750
Motherfucker, you can't have
my corn bread, that's for damn sure.

42:04.834 --> 42:07.419
If you try to take it,
part two of my killin' spree...

42:07.503 --> 42:09.588
...gonna begin up here on your ass now.

42:09.672 --> 42:12.174
If you're thinkin' about my corn bread,
forget it.

42:12.258 --> 42:14.593
- That's for sure. Fuck that.
- Cool it.

42:15.010 --> 42:17.096
I'm from New York City, goddamn it.

42:17.179 --> 42:18.973
Nobody take no corn bread from me.

42:19.056 --> 42:22.393
That go for you and any other
of you motherfucking farmers.

42:22.476 --> 42:26.563
You fuck around with me, there's gonna
be consequences and repercussions.

42:28.190 --> 42:29.400
Get up!

42:45.207 --> 42:49.002
Come on! Show that son of a bitch
how y'all do it in Harlem.

43:10.607 --> 43:12.150
Come on, New York.

43:23.870 --> 43:26.706
I appreciate you taking the trouble
over my corn bread.

43:26.790 --> 43:29.292
You don't get a lot of compliments here.

43:38.927 --> 43:40.512
Get up!

43:42.764 --> 43:45.600
I think you made your point,
whatever that is.

43:45.683 --> 43:49.437
Now's a good time to throw in the towel,
you know what I'm sayin'?

43:51.356 --> 43:53.483
Not over no corn bread.

43:59.697 --> 44:04.244
Goldmouth, I know a bitch
named Della hit harder than you.

44:11.084 --> 44:14.170
That's it.
The man's taken enough of a beating.

44:15.380 --> 44:18.424
Goldmouth, pick him up
and carry him on inside.

44:29.602 --> 44:32.313
He ain't gettin' my corn bread.

44:39.529 --> 44:42.240
You were scared, huh? Don't be scared.

45:14.563 --> 45:15.648
Papa!

45:16.732 --> 45:18.234
That's my boy.

45:22.863 --> 45:25.407
Request permission
to go to the tonk, boss.

45:25.991 --> 45:28.702
Conjugal visits
are for married prisoners only...

45:28.786 --> 45:31.121
...and I don't see no weddin' ring.

45:31.664 --> 45:33.916
Can't you make an exception?

45:34.583 --> 45:39.254
I could issue a temporary marriage license,
for a nominal fee.

45:44.176 --> 45:46.386
- Here you go.
- Sure is pretty.

45:48.514 --> 45:50.641
I now pronounce you man and wife.

45:50.724 --> 45:52.684
You go have a good time.

45:55.938 --> 45:58.231
Claude Banks going to the tonk!

46:02.569 --> 46:04.655
- Come on, now.
- Five cents.

46:06.615 --> 46:09.785
Hey, New York.
You ever been to that Cotton Club?

46:09.868 --> 46:12.329
The Cotton Club in Manhattan?
Many times.

46:12.412 --> 46:15.373
I damn near lived in the Cotton Club.
It's all right.

46:15.457 --> 46:17.667
They ain't got nothin'
on the Boom-Boom Room.

46:17.751 --> 46:20.796
You ever go to New York,
go to Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

46:21.463 --> 46:22.923
What is the Boom-Boom Room?

46:23.006 --> 46:26.343
That's my spot.
Most happening space in Manhattan.

46:27.302 --> 46:29.221
So you got your own nightclub?

46:29.304 --> 46:32.432
It's kinda in the development stages,
but I'm working on it.

46:32.515 --> 46:33.934
So it don't exist?

46:34.017 --> 46:35.936
It exists in my mind.

46:36.478 --> 46:39.314
It start your brain first.

46:39.481 --> 46:41.900
As a man think it, so shall he get.

46:41.983 --> 46:45.195
Some shit like that.
You know, you read the Bible.

46:46.237 --> 46:49.407
Did you go see my cousin Melvin
like I asked you to in my letter?

46:49.491 --> 46:52.786
Of course, I did.
He said he'd file an appeal right away.

46:54.245 --> 46:56.831
Melvin wanted to know...

46:56.915 --> 46:59.209
...if he should file an appeal for your friend.

46:59.292 --> 47:00.919
Ray Gibson? No.

47:03.755 --> 47:05.924
No, Daisy.

47:07.008 --> 47:11.512
He's the reason I'm in here.
He's got a record a mile long.

47:11.846 --> 47:14.390
I got a better shot of gettin' outta here
on my own.

47:14.474 --> 47:18.728
You tell Melvin to think about me.
Just concentrate on me.

47:25.443 --> 47:28.154
- Cookie made me a map to Greenville.
- So?

47:28.613 --> 47:31.365
- You know what I'm sayin'.
- I know what you're sayin'.

47:31.449 --> 47:35.620
If you made it that far, they'd check
every train that pulls out of the station.

47:36.120 --> 47:40.291
We ain't takin' the train. There's a farm
on the map and a boat on the farm.

47:40.374 --> 47:43.294
You know about boats?
You probably don't know how to swim.

47:43.377 --> 47:47.215
I know a boat can help sail our ass
away from here. We can do this shit.

47:47.298 --> 47:49.258
- Why are you always saying 'we'?
- What?

47:49.342 --> 47:52.637
There's no 'we.'
There's a me, and there's a you.

47:52.720 --> 47:56.223
- Why're you talkin' so loud?
- There ain't no 'we' between us.

48:07.651 --> 48:08.944
Hey, Ray!

48:11.864 --> 48:12.948
Yeah?

48:14.033 --> 48:16.535
What's the name
of that nightclub of yours again?

48:16.619 --> 48:19.622
- You talkin' about the Boom-Boom Room?
- Yeah.

48:19.705 --> 48:24.460
That's it. I'd sure like to see that place
when you get it all up and runnin'.

48:24.668 --> 48:28.088
- Yeah, me too.
- Me too. I'd like to see that room too.

48:28.464 --> 48:32.593
You should've been there last night.
You'd have had big fun.

48:33.010 --> 48:34.928
What you talkin' about, 'last night'?

48:35.012 --> 48:37.222
Just like I said, last night.

48:37.473 --> 48:40.017
Satchmo was there
and nearly blew the roof off.

48:40.100 --> 48:42.061
- Ray, who that?
- Satchmo.

48:42.644 --> 48:44.271
You mean Louis Armstrong?

48:44.354 --> 48:46.231
I call him Satchmo. I know him.

48:46.315 --> 48:49.735
I call him Satchmo,
and he come by whenever he in town.

48:49.818 --> 48:53.155
Ain't nobody wanting to hear that bullshit.

48:53.864 --> 48:56.450
Shut the fuck up.

48:56.700 --> 48:59.578
Always saying things at the wrong time.

48:59.661 --> 49:01.955
Go to sleep. Let us have our fun.

49:02.122 --> 49:04.374
Finish telling us about Satchmo.

49:04.458 --> 49:06.168
Go ahead, tell me more.

49:08.462 --> 49:11.506
As I was sayin',
last night y'all should've come by.

49:12.007 --> 49:14.134
You'll never guess who'll be there tonight.

49:14.217 --> 49:16.136
Who gonna be there?

49:16.219 --> 49:18.263
- Who that, Ray?
- Just guess.

49:20.515 --> 49:23.435
'I got a man that's more than 8-foot tall

49:23.852 --> 49:26.563
'Four foot shoulders and that ain't all

49:26.646 --> 49:28.815
'He's a king-sized papa

49:29.357 --> 49:31.485
'He's my king-sized papa'

49:31.860 --> 49:33.111
Sing, girl!

49:33.195 --> 49:37.449
'I take the door off the hinges
When my baby comes to call'

49:38.575 --> 49:40.952
Catch any cab headin' uptown...

49:41.036 --> 49:44.164
...all the drivers know
about Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

49:44.247 --> 49:45.832
Ray! Where am I?

49:46.708 --> 49:49.669
Goldmouth,
somebody's gotta watch the door.

49:52.922 --> 49:55.842
Now I could get used to this. Ladies.

50:00.638 --> 50:02.932
Ray, this steak tastes like butter.

50:03.391 --> 50:04.976
Made it just for you, Cookie.

50:05.059 --> 50:08.521
- You got some steak sauce?
- Boy, get us some Worcestershire sauce.

50:08.605 --> 50:11.691
And clean off that damn table,
or I'll whup your ass.

50:14.444 --> 50:17.280
Is something wrong with your ears?
Move it!

50:17.822 --> 50:20.325
Ray! I know your club got gambling.

50:20.658 --> 50:23.286
Poker.
Wouldn't be a club without some dice.

50:24.746 --> 50:28.499
Lucky seven! My man! Let it ride!

50:28.875 --> 50:31.210
All right, Poker, lettin' it ride.

50:35.590 --> 50:38.176
- Raid! Don't move!
- Shit! Party's over.

50:38.259 --> 50:40.636
- Son of a bitch!
- Goddamn! Party over.

50:41.053 --> 50:44.390
Get the back door!
Put all the women in my car! Gibson!

50:45.975 --> 50:48.352
You about ready to spend
the night in the hole.

50:48.436 --> 50:51.522
Now shut up and go to sleep.
You got that?

50:53.024 --> 50:55.776
That goes for the rest of you girls too.

50:55.860 --> 51:00.031
Now I don't wanna hear another peep
about no fuckin' Boom-Boom Room.

51:02.450 --> 51:03.701
Sorry, Cap'n.

51:03.784 --> 51:06.287
Shut your mouth and your fat ass.

51:07.288 --> 51:10.916
Don't be playing with yourselves.
You gotta work in the morning.

51:15.421 --> 51:16.755
Mail call!

51:19.341 --> 51:20.759
That's mine.

51:20.885 --> 51:23.679
You know I hate this part,
it's too hard for me.

51:23.762 --> 51:26.682
I'm gonna get back
to that game in a little while.

51:36.609 --> 51:39.653
- Right here.
- Melvin Banks, Esquire, Attorney at Law.

51:39.737 --> 51:43.115
- What's going on?
- This don't concern you. Excuse me.

51:43.741 --> 51:45.284
Yeah, obviously not.

51:49.288 --> 51:51.373
Slow up. You see me countin'.

51:51.457 --> 51:53.041
Go on. Come on.

51:53.667 --> 51:56.795
This here is Biscuit.
This is New York City One...

51:57.754 --> 51:59.173
Let's move on!

51:59.256 --> 52:01.550
Only 15 hours of daylight left.

52:03.218 --> 52:05.429
Got all my rocks here, boss.

52:07.389 --> 52:10.183
Sure is hot. Think it's gonna rain later?

52:11.393 --> 52:14.563
- What you want?
- What makes you think I want something?

52:14.646 --> 52:18.233
My dad told me when someone talks about
the weather, watch your wallet.

52:18.317 --> 52:20.736
Your daddy must have been a wise man.

52:21.236 --> 52:23.947
Cut the shit and tell me what you want.

52:24.281 --> 52:26.158
You still got that map?

52:26.366 --> 52:28.410
Yeah, I still got it. Why?

52:30.162 --> 52:32.914
If you thinkin' about bookin' it, I want in.

52:33.165 --> 52:35.083
I think we can make it.

52:35.750 --> 52:38.461
Didn't you tell me there was no 'we'?

52:38.628 --> 52:43.174
Now it's 'we' again? What happened?
Bad news in that letter?

52:43.592 --> 52:47.846
My cousin Melvin is a lawyer
and he filed an appeal on my behalf.

52:47.929 --> 52:50.557
On your behalf? What happened to 'we'?

52:50.640 --> 52:52.892
- The appeal was denied.
- I'm glad.

52:52.976 --> 52:56.271
Daisy fell for Melvin.
They're engaged to be married.

52:56.354 --> 52:58.773
- Can you believe that?
- That's hard to believe.

52:58.857 --> 53:02.777
He a big, successful New York lawyer
and you here with a bright future in cotton.

53:02.861 --> 53:06.531
Let me figure it out for you.
Eenie, meenie, miney, Melvin!

53:07.991 --> 53:09.951
Come on, Ray. I'm serious.

53:10.326 --> 53:13.496
Don't shut me out.
You, me, the map... we can go places.

53:13.580 --> 53:16.040
The whole time we been here...

53:16.124 --> 53:18.042
...you just blame this shit on me.

53:18.126 --> 53:20.336
And you just think about yourself.

53:20.420 --> 53:23.172
- Your little scheme. Was I part of that?
- No.

53:23.256 --> 53:26.134
You'll be honest now
'cause you wanna be friends.

53:26.426 --> 53:29.721
Let me tell you somethin',
Mr. My-Shit-Don't-Stink Banks.

53:29.804 --> 53:33.433
You got to learn a whole lot more
about friendship.

53:33.558 --> 53:35.727
Boss, he ain't workin'!

53:38.563 --> 53:41.774
- Does this mean I'm in?
- Nah, you'd probably slow me down.

53:41.858 --> 53:44.527
You'll be worrying about
your silverware being clean.

53:44.610 --> 53:47.113
You one of them soft motherfuckers.

53:47.280 --> 53:50.032
- What you say?
- I said you soft. So what?

53:50.491 --> 53:53.619
- What you gonna do?
- No man calls me soft. I hate that!

53:53.703 --> 53:56.581
I'm a man, and I called you soft.

53:56.664 --> 53:59.792
I don't like you swellin' all up.

53:59.875 --> 54:02.044
Why you takin' in all this air for?

54:02.128 --> 54:04.213
What's on your mind?

54:04.297 --> 54:06.966
You gonna put your chin up?
That mean something to me?

54:07.049 --> 54:09.051
'Cause I said 'soft'? So what?

54:09.135 --> 54:11.762
I spell it. S-O-F-capital-T!

54:12.013 --> 54:14.765
Soft! What you gonna do?

54:19.228 --> 54:22.148
You must be crazy. I'll kill you.

54:22.231 --> 54:25.234
- Oh, this is good.
- Break it up!

54:34.159 --> 54:37.746
I'm gettin' ready to shoot somebody here!

54:37.871 --> 54:39.832
I'm gonna shoot a motherfucker today.

54:39.915 --> 54:42.167
Ain't gonna forget this,
you New York Cities.

54:42.251 --> 54:45.087
- He started it.
- Don't go to sleep, nigger.

54:45.671 --> 54:49.258
I don't mess with nobody. You know that.

54:53.971 --> 54:57.224
Get back to work.

54:57.808 --> 55:00.602
This ain't over, nigger.
I don't give a fuck what he say.

55:00.686 --> 55:01.812
I'll shoot your ass.

55:01.895 --> 55:03.605
Don't go to sleep!

55:04.481 --> 55:06.400
We'll see who go to sleep.

55:21.331 --> 55:23.625
Shit. Come on! Two running!

55:31.425 --> 55:35.178
I know these trees all look alike,
but this one is awful familiar.

55:35.262 --> 55:37.013
Let me see that map.

55:41.309 --> 55:43.061
You call this a map?

55:43.311 --> 55:46.106
What was Cookie smokin'
when he drew this?

55:46.189 --> 55:48.942
Cookie didn't draw it. I drew it up.

55:50.068 --> 55:53.238
We're in the middle of nowhere.
You don't know where we're goin'.

55:53.321 --> 55:56.116
I drew it 'cause you wouldn't come
unless I had a map.

55:56.199 --> 55:58.368
Now come on!

55:58.702 --> 56:01.204
Wait up. Wait up!

56:36.072 --> 56:38.366
Take the dogs around the house!

56:39.033 --> 56:41.994
Y'all bring the dogs with me! Come on!

56:45.123 --> 56:46.791
Come on!

57:04.642 --> 57:06.519
Here they are, Superintendent.

57:06.602 --> 57:09.438
Tracked 'em all the way
to the Tallahatchie.

57:09.605 --> 57:11.816
That's quite a ways, isn't it?

57:12.066 --> 57:14.485
I'm glad you New York boys
got to see some of...

57:14.568 --> 57:16.987
...our beautiful countryside
while we got you here.

57:17.071 --> 57:18.322
Mae Rose!

57:19.657 --> 57:23.369
What do you think we oughta do
to teach 'em a lesson?

57:25.538 --> 57:26.747
A night in the hole?

57:26.831 --> 57:29.708
A night in the hole. Better make it a week.

57:52.606 --> 57:54.525
No, don't move so fast.

58:02.699 --> 58:04.159
Fuck y'all!

58:05.285 --> 58:07.037
- Hey, Claude!
- What?

58:07.454 --> 58:09.289
You got a toilet in yours?

58:09.373 --> 58:11.917
That was the first time
that Ray and Claude ran...

58:12.000 --> 58:13.043
...but it sure wasn't the last.

58:13.669 --> 58:16.588
Japan suffers its
most crushing defeat of the war.

58:17.881 --> 58:21.301
Years passed, and the world went to war
for a second time.

58:23.136 --> 58:26.473
While they was fightin' for freedom
on the outside...

58:26.556 --> 58:29.685
...we were dreamin' about it on the inside.

58:31.103 --> 58:33.230
Camp 8 is for incorrigibles.

58:34.940 --> 58:37.526
Whatever you done, I'm not impressed.

58:37.609 --> 58:39.569
I've seen it all before.

58:39.945 --> 58:42.989
You probably noticed that we got
no fences at Camp 8.

58:43.073 --> 58:46.618
We don't need fences
'cause we got a gun line.

58:46.952 --> 58:48.495
It runs from...

58:53.708 --> 58:56.503
What the hell you doin'?

58:57.379 --> 59:01.383
The boy can't talk.
Somethin' wrong with his head.

59:03.051 --> 59:05.220
Just can't get right, boss.

59:06.971 --> 59:08.640
'Can't get right.'

59:09.683 --> 59:12.185
All right. We'll see how long he lasts.

59:12.268 --> 59:14.979
- Where was I?
- We don't need no fences at Camp 8.

59:15.063 --> 59:18.608
- What?
- We don't need no fences here at Camp 8.

59:19.400 --> 59:21.402
- The gun line, boss.
- Yes.

59:22.737 --> 59:24.906
You prisoners are now inside the gun line.

59:24.989 --> 59:27.992
When Dillard found out
that Claude was a baseball man...

59:28.076 --> 59:30.078
...he put him in charge of the team.

59:30.161 --> 59:33.539
That way, when we lost,
he could blame it on somebody else.

59:37.669 --> 59:39.504
No, that's not it.

59:43.549 --> 59:47.095
Try to teach 'em the finer points
of the game...

59:47.387 --> 59:49.931
...share my wisdom, but do they listen?

59:50.473 --> 59:52.558
They damn sure don't learn.

59:53.142 --> 59:55.353
You're dealin' with a total lack of talent.

59:55.436 --> 59:57.396
Ain't nobody got no talent.

59:57.605 --> 01:00:00.191
Every year,
Camp 12 wins the championship.

01:00:00.274 --> 01:00:03.903
Every year they get to roast a victory pig.
This year, I want that pig.

01:00:03.986 --> 01:00:06.572
Jangle Leg, put it right to him.

01:00:10.117 --> 01:00:12.203
That's what I'm talking about!

01:00:12.411 --> 01:00:14.872
Who wants to hit next?

01:00:15.790 --> 01:00:18.376
- Find the card.
- Don't nobody wanna hit?

01:00:18.668 --> 01:00:20.294
Do you wanna hit?

01:00:20.795 --> 01:00:23.339
Let Can't Get Right have a swing.

01:00:24.006 --> 01:00:27.093
- Him?
- He can't be worse than the rest.

01:00:27.468 --> 01:00:29.595
Let the boy have a swing.

01:00:32.139 --> 01:00:34.975
Let's see what you can do.

01:00:35.059 --> 01:00:39.313
Put that bat in your hand,
hold it tight and take a nice swing.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.817
Jangle Leg, a little easy on him.

01:00:44.568 --> 01:00:48.072
- He's new, so we don't wanna...
- Don't try to hurt the man.

01:00:52.076 --> 01:00:54.370
Even swing, Can't Get Right.

01:00:54.453 --> 01:00:57.039
Don't be scared of the ball.

01:01:05.881 --> 01:01:07.466
That wasn't bad.

01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:09.676
Put that on it.

01:01:09.843 --> 01:01:13.096
That might have been
one of those retard mistakes.

01:01:24.858 --> 01:01:26.860
Give him that tricky one.

01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:44.294
Damn.

01:01:45.837 --> 01:01:47.464
Daddy!

01:01:48.048 --> 01:01:51.343
- That's just like fresh water.
- Hey, my little girl.

01:01:51.468 --> 01:01:54.763
- Look like little Mae Rose done growed up.
- And out.

01:01:55.263 --> 01:01:56.973
That girl got gams.

01:01:58.016 --> 01:01:59.643
How was the honeymoon?

01:01:59.768 --> 01:02:01.895
- You gonna stay for supper?
- 'Fraid not.

01:02:01.978 --> 01:02:04.105
I'm shippin' out this afternoon.

01:02:04.481 --> 01:02:07.233
You lookin' a little bit too hard.

01:02:08.401 --> 01:02:11.321
Duh, my ass. You better just...

01:02:12.364 --> 01:02:14.407
Turn around to the left.
We have a problem.

01:02:14.491 --> 01:02:16.576
It's all right to glance occasionally...

01:02:16.659 --> 01:02:19.579
...but you look like you wanted to go
and start fucking.

01:02:19.662 --> 01:02:23.666
Turn around. I'm keepin' you out
of some trouble. Paint the fence.

01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:25.543
Banks! Get over here.

01:02:26.211 --> 01:02:28.463
I'll be right back.

01:02:30.048 --> 01:02:32.592
Stan Blocker,
a scout for the nigger leagues.

01:02:32.675 --> 01:02:35.011
Negro leagues, actually.

01:02:35.553 --> 01:02:37.847
Pittsburgh Crawfords. Ever hear of us?

01:02:37.931 --> 01:02:40.391
We get the games on the radio sometimes.

01:02:40.475 --> 01:02:42.727
We played in Jackson yesterday...

01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:45.355
...heard you got a boy who can hit the ball.

01:02:46.648 --> 01:02:48.483
You must mean Can't Get Right.

01:02:48.566 --> 01:02:50.985
That's him over there.

01:02:51.069 --> 01:02:53.863
'Can't Get Right'? That's the kid's name?

01:02:54.072 --> 01:02:55.198
Yep.

01:02:56.365 --> 01:02:58.034
Can I talk to him?

01:02:58.576 --> 01:03:02.580
You could try, but you won't get too far.
Why're you interested?

01:03:03.581 --> 01:03:06.375
Crawfords are always looking
for new talent.

01:03:07.084 --> 01:03:10.463
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but this is a prison.

01:03:10.588 --> 01:03:12.715
There are ways around that.

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:14.675
Right, Sergeant?

01:03:14.967 --> 01:03:16.510
One never knows.

01:03:19.138 --> 01:03:20.848
Nice looking squad.

01:03:27.605 --> 01:03:30.691
- Look at the way she glows.
- She is pretty, isn't she?

01:03:30.775 --> 01:03:32.151
Thanks, Mom.

01:03:33.277 --> 01:03:36.197
And we're gonna have a baby.
Oh my goodness.

01:03:44.455 --> 01:03:47.917
Can't Get Right, no, you can't do that.

01:03:51.253 --> 01:03:53.505
Let's keep what mind you got focused.

01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:57.885
If you hit that ball,
you might be our ticket off this farm.

01:03:57.968 --> 01:03:59.928
Come on. Think victory.

01:04:00.804 --> 01:04:04.433
The ball! Keep your eye on the ball.

01:04:04.516 --> 01:04:07.770
Get up underneath that motherfucker.
Do your thing!

01:04:07.853 --> 01:04:10.814
Put some of that dumb strength on it!

01:04:13.192 --> 01:04:16.111
We gonna knock that shit
right off the team!

01:04:19.781 --> 01:04:21.825
That's what I'm talkin' about!

01:04:22.451 --> 01:04:24.411
Don't stand there! Run!

01:04:24.912 --> 01:04:26.914
Run! Go! Just haul ass!

01:04:27.581 --> 01:04:29.208
Run, nigger, run!

01:04:30.375 --> 01:04:33.712
Oh, that's our ticket off this farm.

01:04:44.056 --> 01:04:45.432
You mark my words.

01:04:45.515 --> 01:04:48.393
In five years, there'll be
a colored man in the majors.

01:04:48.477 --> 01:04:51.480
I don't think the world changed that much.

01:04:51.772 --> 01:04:53.732
Maybe not yet, but it will.

01:04:53.815 --> 01:04:55.609
I'll be out of a job.

01:04:55.984 --> 01:04:57.903
That's some tasty hootch.

01:04:57.986 --> 01:05:01.990
It's amazing what Ray can do
with potato skins and some molasses.

01:05:02.782 --> 01:05:06.203
What you think about our boy?
He got something?

01:05:06.286 --> 01:05:08.455
He could be the next Josh Gibson.

01:05:10.248 --> 01:05:13.501
It's getting late, boys.
We got a game in Memphis tomorrow.

01:05:13.585 --> 01:05:15.795
What about us?
Don't forget to mention us.

01:05:15.879 --> 01:05:19.299
'Cause we like his handlers.
We take care of everything for him.

01:05:19.382 --> 01:05:21.092
I'll put in a good word for you.

01:05:21.176 --> 01:05:23.053
He can't function without us.

01:05:23.136 --> 01:05:25.263
- You've done a good job with him.
- Thanks.

01:05:25.346 --> 01:05:28.558
- We're hands-on with him.
- Okay. All right.

01:05:28.641 --> 01:05:30.560
- Take care.
- Have a nice day.

01:05:31.269 --> 01:05:33.396
- Walked off with my drink.
- Sure did.

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:37.400
I ain't gonna say nothin'. Have a good day!

01:05:37.984 --> 01:05:41.404
- Y'all come on over here!
- Y'all got something to drink?

01:05:41.487 --> 01:05:43.907
Look what we got! Some of your stuff.

01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:46.826
Can't Get Right, this one's for you, baby!

01:05:57.253 --> 01:05:58.921
What in the world?

01:06:01.507 --> 01:06:02.592
What?

01:06:07.388 --> 01:06:10.433
- Is Mae Rose all right?
- She's doin' just fine.

01:06:11.017 --> 01:06:12.810
What about the baby?

01:06:14.562 --> 01:06:16.063
He's a big'un.

01:06:16.772 --> 01:06:19.358
'He'? It's a boy? Honey, it's a boy!

01:06:21.569 --> 01:06:22.737
Yeah, buddy!

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:25.156
Let me see that boy! Where is that boy?

01:06:25.239 --> 01:06:27.116
Show me that grandboy!

01:06:29.452 --> 01:06:33.289
I want every man in this camp
on the line right now!

01:06:33.914 --> 01:06:36.083
Right now! I mean right now!

01:06:36.375 --> 01:06:38.711
Bring 'em out here! Let me see 'em!

01:07:08.657 --> 01:07:11.368
Hope not. It was somebody in this camp.

01:07:12.953 --> 01:07:14.955
I can feel it in my bones.

01:07:22.129 --> 01:07:24.256
Daddy, give me my baby back.

01:07:29.887 --> 01:07:32.890
What you laughin' at? You laughin' at me?

01:07:34.057 --> 01:07:36.977
You know who the daddy
of that chocolated baby is?

01:07:37.394 --> 01:07:38.770
You do?

01:07:39.187 --> 01:07:41.231
Well, who is it? Speak up!

01:07:42.357 --> 01:07:44.067
It's my baby, boss.

01:07:44.651 --> 01:07:46.903
He's lying. I'm the father of that baby.

01:07:46.987 --> 01:07:49.114
Boss, I'm that baby's daddy.

01:07:50.657 --> 01:07:52.909
Any fool can see that baby belongs to me.

01:07:52.993 --> 01:07:56.121
I wanna differ.
That little rascal belong to me.

01:07:56.663 --> 01:07:59.332
Proud to say, boss, I'm that baby's daddy.

01:07:59.833 --> 01:08:03.211
- I be the pa, boss.
- I'm the pa of that there young'un.

01:08:04.087 --> 01:08:05.463
I the pappy.

01:08:33.658 --> 01:08:35.410
That was the last we ever saw...

01:08:35.493 --> 01:08:38.371
...of Superintendent Abernathy
and little Mae Rose.

01:08:39.997 --> 01:08:42.207
To celebrate his departure...

01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:45.377
...Camp 8 threw ourselves a little party.

01:08:46.462 --> 01:08:48.339
Ray provided the moonshine...

01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:51.384
...and Claude managed to scare up
some girls.

01:08:51.759 --> 01:08:55.220
It wasn't quite the Boom-Boom Room,
but it was close enough.

01:09:00.143 --> 01:09:01.602
Come on, now.

01:09:02.478 --> 01:09:05.356
She don't mean nothin' to him.
Don't pay that no mind.

01:09:05.439 --> 01:09:07.859
To hell with him. It ain't that.

01:09:08.859 --> 01:09:12.029
What's your problem,
sittin' around lookin' all sad and shit?

01:09:12.113 --> 01:09:15.116
It's almost all right in here today.

01:09:20.453 --> 01:09:21.872
What's this?

01:09:27.252 --> 01:09:29.505
A release form.
You gettin' out this month.

01:09:29.589 --> 01:09:33.551
- What you sittin' around lookin' all sad for?
- What am I gonna do out there?

01:09:33.634 --> 01:09:36.011
I can't go home to my mama like this.

01:09:36.095 --> 01:09:40.140
You are crazy. Your mama gonna be happy
when you get home.

01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:42.268
But not like this, Ray.

01:09:42.935 --> 01:09:46.564
Hey, look. The world done changed
a lot. It's 1945, boy.

01:09:47.773 --> 01:09:49.567
Not for me, it ain't.

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:55.865
You can't stay here. That's for damn sure.

01:09:56.115 --> 01:10:00.286
Anybody else in the place would give
his right arm... I know I would.

01:10:04.832 --> 01:10:08.335
Shit. Fuckin' release papers,
sittin' over here lookin' sad.

01:10:09.253 --> 01:10:11.171
I won't sit here with you lookin' sad.

01:10:11.255 --> 01:10:14.717
You got the best news of the day
and you're sitting here looking sad.

01:10:15.217 --> 01:10:17.761
You cheer up. You're goin' home.

01:10:17.928 --> 01:10:20.931
Hey, man, that's good news.
Come on. You're goin' home.

01:10:21.014 --> 01:10:22.850
You gonna smile? There you go.

01:10:22.933 --> 01:10:25.144
I'll see you in a minute.

01:10:49.126 --> 01:10:51.128
Where you goin', Biscuit?

01:10:54.089 --> 01:10:56.591
Where you goin'? Don't do that!

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.012
Hold it right there!

01:11:03.849 --> 01:11:06.059
Man over the line!

01:12:06.661 --> 01:12:08.162
I got Chicago!

01:12:09.497 --> 01:12:11.833
- Goldmouth, I got Chicago!
- Yeah?

01:12:12.458 --> 01:12:14.043
Come on, fellas.

01:12:14.794 --> 01:12:17.338
- Where you goin'?
- Why you all dressed up?

01:12:22.093 --> 01:12:23.511
What's this?

01:12:24.095 --> 01:12:25.972
What the fuck is going on?

01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:31.727
Blocker! What's goin' on here?

01:12:32.144 --> 01:12:34.730
The kid's gettin' out. I got him a pardon.

01:12:35.022 --> 01:12:37.900
What about me and Ray?
Our names ain't on the pardon.

01:12:37.984 --> 01:12:40.820
- You said you put in a good word for us.
- I did.

01:12:41.904 --> 01:12:44.657
I mentioned you. I mentioned both of you.

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:47.576
But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap.

01:12:48.202 --> 01:12:51.038
That kid can hit. What can you guys do?

01:12:51.372 --> 01:12:54.834
We're the ones who worked with him...

01:12:55.084 --> 01:12:57.711
...night and day.
- Forget it, man. Let it go.

01:12:57.795 --> 01:13:00.548
I'm not gonna let it go.

01:13:00.631 --> 01:13:04.218
The man said he was gonna put in
a good word. Explain yourself.

01:13:04.301 --> 01:13:07.221
But the kid's gettin' out,
that's what you wanted.

01:13:17.898 --> 01:13:19.566
Yeah. Of course.

01:13:26.031 --> 01:13:28.325
You show them Crawfords
how to play ball.

01:13:28.409 --> 01:13:30.369
Make 'em throw you strikes.

01:13:34.832 --> 01:13:36.708
Go. You're a free man.

01:13:42.965 --> 01:13:44.466
It's all right.

01:14:12.244 --> 01:14:14.579
- Come on, son.
- We love you, boy.

01:14:16.998 --> 01:14:18.500
Hit that ball, boy.

01:14:18.834 --> 01:14:21.920
You hit one out the park for me.

01:14:22.963 --> 01:14:25.799
Play hard, Can't Get Right!

01:14:31.137 --> 01:14:33.014
We'll catch you on the radio!

01:14:33.098 --> 01:14:35.100
All right. So that's that.

01:14:35.475 --> 01:14:38.687
A new boy told me
they're farming that land by the swamp.

01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:41.648
- He saw a crop duster flyin'...
- I'm not in the mood.

01:14:41.731 --> 01:14:44.484
It's behind the barn.
It can't be that hard to fly it.

01:14:44.567 --> 01:14:46.986
- Lots of people do it.
- They're called pilots.

01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:50.323
I'm not in the mood
for your fucked-up plans.

01:14:50.406 --> 01:14:52.534
I don't hear you comin' up with no plan!

01:14:52.617 --> 01:14:55.620
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh
right now.

01:14:56.371 --> 01:14:59.874
Can't Get Right just got a pardon
signed by the governor, thanks to us.

01:14:59.958 --> 01:15:02.168
But we can't do nothin' for ourselves.

01:15:02.252 --> 01:15:04.963
Don't you feel a little frustrated right now?

01:15:05.505 --> 01:15:08.967
- Crop duster.
- I'm not gettin' in no airplane with you.

01:15:13.805 --> 01:15:17.308
I'm finally wrapping my mind
around this whole concept.

01:15:17.558 --> 01:15:21.521
- What concept is that?
- They threw us in this shithole for life.

01:15:21.729 --> 01:15:23.773
Don't you get it? We gonna die here.

01:15:23.856 --> 01:15:27.401
We might as well head to the cemetery,
pick a plot and start digging.

01:15:27.485 --> 01:15:30.988
My daddy died in a place like this
because of what you're sayin'.

01:15:31.072 --> 01:15:34.116
He gave up hope and hung hisself.
I ain't goin' out like that!

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.371
Maybe you're foolin' yourself.
Maybe you just a chip off the old block.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.292
Take that back,
or we ain't friends no more.

01:15:43.376 --> 01:15:46.170
News flash. We ain't never been friends.

01:15:46.295 --> 01:15:48.964
We just been stuck together for 12 years.

01:15:49.048 --> 01:15:52.635
It's been nothin' but pure hell
since the moment I ran into you.

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:55.388
Every time I look at you,
I get sick to my stomach...

01:15:55.471 --> 01:15:58.724
...thinkin' what my life could've been
if I never bumped into you.

01:15:58.808 --> 01:16:01.227
Slow down, you might say
something you'll regret.

01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:05.773
- You better quiet down, nigger.
- Only thing I regret is the day I met you.

01:16:08.317 --> 01:16:09.944
- That's the way it is?
- Yeah, that's the way it is.

01:16:10.110 --> 01:16:12.988
I ain't got nothin' else to say to your ass.

01:16:13.072 --> 01:16:14.406
Thank you!

01:16:16.408 --> 01:16:19.870
Now if you ask me,
when Can't Get Right left Camp 8...

01:16:20.037 --> 01:16:22.373
...a piece of Claude left with him.

01:16:23.666 --> 01:16:26.168
And with Ray and Claude not talkin'...

01:16:26.293 --> 01:16:29.463
...the place felt a little harder,
a little colder.

01:16:57.574 --> 01:16:59.201
I have a dream.

01:17:01.244 --> 01:17:04.873
I'm the greatest! I'm the king of the world.

01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:20.305
We got to fight for ourselves.

01:17:33.193 --> 01:17:35.528
I'll see y'all in New York City!

01:17:36.071 --> 01:17:37.614
Oh, shit!

01:18:29.999 --> 01:18:31.709
Round about 1972...

01:18:32.710 --> 01:18:34.796
...I got transferred to the infirmary...

01:18:35.505 --> 01:18:38.090
...and those two fools were still at it.

01:18:42.678 --> 01:18:45.056
But no matter how tough a man is...

01:18:45.348 --> 01:18:47.558
...he spends enough time on this farm...

01:18:47.642 --> 01:18:49.852
...he'll find his breaking point.

01:18:50.436 --> 01:18:53.147
It could be triggered by any little thing.

01:18:53.272 --> 01:18:55.566
A face. A voice. Even a smell.

01:19:06.911 --> 01:19:08.496
White-only pies.

01:19:13.042 --> 01:19:14.710
Man over the line!

01:19:29.892 --> 01:19:31.644
That boy went crazy.

01:19:36.857 --> 01:19:38.442
You comfortable?

01:19:39.193 --> 01:19:41.945
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers.

01:19:43.822 --> 01:19:47.367
That's very amusin'.
We'll see how them slippers feel...

01:19:47.743 --> 01:19:49.661
...after about 24 hours.

01:19:52.956 --> 01:19:54.708
I need a volunteer!

01:19:55.959 --> 01:19:57.586
Gibson, stand up.

01:19:58.754 --> 01:20:01.089
I'll make you trusty right now.

01:20:01.214 --> 01:20:03.884
If that pie-eatin' bastard step off
them bottles...

01:20:03.967 --> 01:20:06.094
...if so much as one toe hit that dirt...

01:20:06.178 --> 01:20:08.347
...I want you to shoot him in his ass.

01:20:09.681 --> 01:20:13.018
I want you to kill him.
I want you to shoot him dead.

01:20:13.477 --> 01:20:16.104
You do that, I swear to God,
you're a free man.

01:20:16.188 --> 01:20:18.940
I'll walk you out the gate myself.

01:20:19.566 --> 01:20:21.067
What d'ya say?

01:20:25.447 --> 01:20:28.033
I got to be honest with you, boss.

01:20:28.116 --> 01:20:32.162
You don't wanna give me that gun,
'cause I'd probably shoot you with it.

01:20:34.372 --> 01:20:36.583
That was the wrong answer, boy.

01:20:38.209 --> 01:20:40.837
You a fool. I'd have taken that deal.

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:44.507
I beg pardon? You say something to me?

01:20:44.758 --> 01:20:47.552
I'd have knocked you off,
put a bullet in your ass...

01:20:47.635 --> 01:20:49.971
...and be halfway to New York right now.

01:20:51.806 --> 01:20:55.393
Well, my goodness.
After all these years of blissful silence...

01:20:55.643 --> 01:20:58.813
...I forgot how annoying
the sound of your voice is.

01:20:59.731 --> 01:21:03.651
I hope you know
I don't owe you a damn thing.

01:21:03.735 --> 01:21:06.154
I ain't do nothin' for you to owe me.

01:21:06.237 --> 01:21:09.032
What you got I ain't got? I did it for me.

01:21:09.115 --> 01:21:12.744
I'm a man. I ain't no motherfucking,
bootlickin' trusty.

01:21:12.911 --> 01:21:15.204
You'll make me fall off, talkin' to your ass.

01:21:15.288 --> 01:21:18.291
It's about being poised.
Just poise yourself.

01:21:18.583 --> 01:21:20.084
Poise, my ass.

01:21:25.214 --> 01:21:27.884
Sorry to hear about your mama passing.

01:21:29.719 --> 01:21:31.846
Yeah, about five years ago.

01:21:32.013 --> 01:21:33.264
Thank you.

01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:36.267
Since we're talkin', I thought I'd mention it.

01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:39.812
We not talkin', you talkin'.
And doin' a little bit too much of it.

01:21:39.896 --> 01:21:42.356
Every time you start talkin', I almost fall...

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.942
- Would you stop...
- Don't say nothin' else to me!

01:21:45.026 --> 01:21:48.404
- You about to make me fall.
- Hold still, don't say nothin'.

01:21:51.949 --> 01:21:54.660
Oh! Damn, one of my toes in the bottle.

01:21:54.994 --> 01:21:56.746
Damn it, Ray, shit.

01:22:05.379 --> 01:22:08.174
What you laughin' about?
What's so funny?

01:22:10.801 --> 01:22:13.929
Thinkin' about you runnin' with bullets
flyin' over your head.

01:22:14.013 --> 01:22:17.057
That's something to see there.
That was a sight to see.

01:22:17.141 --> 01:22:19.268
Bullets weren't the problem, Ray.

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:21.145
That pie was too hot.

01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:23.314
Burned my damn tongue.

01:22:27.109 --> 01:22:29.945
It sure is good talkin' to you again.

01:22:31.614 --> 01:22:33.616
Good talkin' to you too.

01:22:35.451 --> 01:22:37.036
Come on! Let's move!

01:22:37.119 --> 01:22:40.080
We got 14 acres of land to clear today!
Let's go!

01:22:40.289 --> 01:22:43.292
Gibson, Banks,
get your sorry asses over here.

01:22:46.044 --> 01:22:48.464
Every mornin' I wake up prayin'...

01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:53.010
...that the two of you
have died in their sleep.

01:22:53.719 --> 01:22:56.263
And every mornin' you disappoint me.

01:22:56.763 --> 01:22:58.182
Sorry, boss.

01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:02.519
You two got 15 minutes
to clear out your lockers.

01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:06.648
The both of you have been transferred
to the superintendent's mansion.

01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:09.151
And I, for one, won't miss you.

01:23:20.871 --> 01:23:22.998
Here's your medicine, Mr. Wilkins.

01:23:23.373 --> 01:23:25.500
My pills. Thank you.

01:23:25.751 --> 01:23:27.252
You're welcome.

01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:37.721
Oh, yard boy.

01:23:38.972 --> 01:23:41.558
This myrtle could use some attention.

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:45.020
Perhaps some fertilizer
would restore its exuberance.

01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:49.316
Get your ass to work.

01:23:53.236 --> 01:23:55.822
Tell me what you think of this place.

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:59.784
It's one of these
new retirement communities...

01:23:59.909 --> 01:24:02.036
...they built down on the Gulf.

01:24:02.746 --> 01:24:06.374
I ought to try to enjoy myself
what few years I got left.

01:24:08.751 --> 01:24:10.712
Let's take a look at this.

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:14.382
Eyesight ain't what it once was.
Ooh, this is nice here.

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:19.762
'Ocean views... palm trees.'

01:24:20.847 --> 01:24:22.849
'Two heated swimming pools.'

01:24:23.683 --> 01:24:27.520
Sounds a damn sight better
than that infirmary across the way...

01:24:27.603 --> 01:24:30.481
...where I'm gonna end up, I'll tell you that.

01:24:37.822 --> 01:24:40.783
I must apologize. That was rude of me.

01:24:41.742 --> 01:24:46.289
That's all right. Takes more than
some colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:51.502
You've been on the farm for quite a spell,
haven't you?

01:24:51.961 --> 01:24:55.047
Over 40 years now.
Me and Ray Gibson out there.

01:24:55.965 --> 01:24:57.383
Forty years.

01:24:58.509 --> 01:25:01.178
That's a long time for any crime,
even murder.

01:25:01.887 --> 01:25:05.141
It's a hell of a lot longer
when you're innocent.

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:09.812
Half the men in this prison
swear they're innocent.

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:13.107
Don't ya think that's kinda funny?

01:25:13.441 --> 01:25:16.152
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.

01:25:17.361 --> 01:25:18.696
Excuse me.

01:25:28.998 --> 01:25:30.958
What you lookin' at, Ray?

01:25:34.962 --> 01:25:38.674
- Just what the fuck you lookin' at?
- I noticed that...

01:25:39.425 --> 01:25:42.761
...I noticed you and Mr. Wilkins
been mighty friendly lately.

01:25:42.845 --> 01:25:44.972
Y'all wanna be a new couple or somethin'?

01:25:45.055 --> 01:25:47.016
Kiss my ass.

01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:50.811
Mr. Wilkins just an old man
that like to talk.

01:25:50.894 --> 01:25:53.439
That's all that is, Ray. That's all.

01:25:54.273 --> 01:25:57.651
Y'all like to talk.
I'm lonely, and I like to talk too.

01:25:57.734 --> 01:25:59.903
What you wanna talk about?

01:26:01.488 --> 01:26:04.116
I wanna talk about the plan
you've been working on.

01:26:04.199 --> 01:26:06.201
I ain't workin' on no plan!

01:26:06.410 --> 01:26:10.455
I know ya. And I know
when you got somethin' brewin'.

01:26:11.498 --> 01:26:13.458
What I got brewin'?

01:26:14.334 --> 01:26:17.296
- You tell me!
- You done lost your damn mind.

01:26:18.839 --> 01:26:21.091
I don't care what you believe.

01:26:21.258 --> 01:26:23.301
You got somethin' up your sleeve.

01:26:23.385 --> 01:26:25.512
Think I'm gonna stay up arguing with you?

01:26:25.595 --> 01:26:29.224
You cuttin' into my sleepin' time.
Kiss my ass and good night.

01:26:29.307 --> 01:26:31.935
Go to sleep, nigger.
I hope it's the long one.

01:26:32.018 --> 01:26:34.104
Why you talkin' instead of sleepin'?

01:26:34.187 --> 01:26:36.439
I'm going to sleep. Why don't you?

01:26:36.523 --> 01:26:39.693
Why can't I just sit here
and look at your ass?

01:26:39.776 --> 01:26:42.279
And wonder what you got up your sleeve.

01:26:42.362 --> 01:26:43.905
I got somethin' brewin'.

01:26:43.989 --> 01:26:47.409
I got an ass-whuppin' for ya
if you don't stop fuckin' with me.

01:26:47.492 --> 01:26:50.245
- That's right.
- All right. Sleep tight.

01:26:52.289 --> 01:26:55.917
I hope your ass piss the bed
with that weak-ass bladder of yours.

01:26:56.001 --> 01:26:59.796
If I do, then I'll put the sheets on you.
How you like that?

01:27:08.555 --> 01:27:10.723
Where the hell you think you goin'?

01:27:11.057 --> 01:27:15.228
Mr. Wilkins' driver got the flu,
and he asked me to fill in for him.

01:27:15.895 --> 01:27:18.606
How you gonna fill in for somebody?
You can't drive.

01:27:18.690 --> 01:27:21.526
You ain't got a license,
ain't drove in 40 years.

01:27:21.609 --> 01:27:23.945
He know you're takin' his life
into your hands?

01:27:24.028 --> 01:27:26.990
- Shut up.
- No. Where the hell you goin'?

01:27:27.949 --> 01:27:31.411
- lf you must know...
- Then I must know. I got to know.

01:27:31.494 --> 01:27:35.373
Greenville. Pick up the new
superintendent at the bus station.

01:27:35.873 --> 01:27:38.459
What's with the old pretty suit?
You Harry Belafonte?

01:27:38.543 --> 01:27:41.462
I look very dapper, very debonair, don't I?

01:27:42.130 --> 01:27:44.132
Now don't touch this car.

01:27:44.841 --> 01:27:47.343
I piss on the motherfucker.
Ain't gonna touch it.

01:27:47.427 --> 01:27:51.430
- Why you got to say nasty shit?
- 'Cause I'm a nasty motherfucker.

01:28:18.207 --> 01:28:20.376
You know I trust you, Claude.

01:28:20.459 --> 01:28:22.461
- I hope so.
- Be right back.

01:29:16.515 --> 01:29:18.183
What the fuck?

01:29:55.428 --> 01:29:59.891
Naturally, I had to get set down next to
your proverbial hypochondriac...

01:30:00.475 --> 01:30:03.478
...middle-aged fat lady
with a goddamn wart on her nose...

01:30:03.561 --> 01:30:06.189
...hair growin' out of it, for Christ's sakes.

01:30:06.272 --> 01:30:07.899
I tell ya, I got to know...

01:30:07.982 --> 01:30:10.276
...her goddamn gall bladder...

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:12.737
...like the back of my goddamn hand.

01:30:16.116 --> 01:30:18.118
Claude? Mr. Pike, Claude.

01:30:19.828 --> 01:30:21.496
There you go, boy.

01:30:22.163 --> 01:30:24.249
Come on. It's time to go.

01:30:24.457 --> 01:30:27.710
Let me get that door for you.
You just stretch out.

01:30:30.088 --> 01:30:31.839
Now you're sure it was him.

01:30:31.923 --> 01:30:34.300
Some faces you just don't forget.

01:30:34.425 --> 01:30:36.761
Warren Pike is one of 'em.

01:30:42.308 --> 01:30:43.685
Got a bird!

01:30:48.231 --> 01:30:50.358
That's quite a haul.

01:30:52.777 --> 01:30:56.155
What d'ya say, Mr. Pike?
You about ready to call it a day?

01:30:58.616 --> 01:31:00.576
Yeah, it's gettin' late...

01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:03.412
...and I sure as hell could use
a nice, hot bath.

01:31:03.621 --> 01:31:06.707
That's a mighty fine
timepiece you got there, Mr. Pike.

01:31:06.791 --> 01:31:09.794
- Even play a fancy tune, huh?
- Yeah, it's special.

01:31:10.086 --> 01:31:13.631
- They don't make 'em like that anymore.
- I'll bet they don't.

01:31:15.216 --> 01:31:19.178
Would you mind if I asked
where you got that from?

01:31:19.804 --> 01:31:23.391
My wife gave it to me
on our anniversary some years back.

01:31:26.435 --> 01:31:28.187
About 40 years back?

01:31:31.649 --> 01:31:34.360
Forty years. Yeah, something like that.

01:31:35.778 --> 01:31:38.280
She give you that scar on your face too?

01:31:38.364 --> 01:31:40.699
I oughta kill you for that remark.

01:31:40.783 --> 01:31:42.576
What's goin' on here?

01:31:42.701 --> 01:31:45.913
I think I might just have
to teach this uppity nigger...

01:31:46.163 --> 01:31:47.957
...a lesson in manners.

01:31:49.708 --> 01:31:52.628
Ray, be cool. You gonna get us
in a lot of trouble now.

01:31:52.711 --> 01:31:56.882
He's right, Gibson. You put that gun down,
or I'm gonna have to shoot ya.

01:31:57.091 --> 01:31:59.927
Then we about to be
some shot-up motherfuckers.

01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:01.929
Don't nobody shoot nobody. Ray...

01:32:02.012 --> 01:32:06.350
...I wanna see this son of a bitch dead.
I don't wanna see you go down with him.

01:32:06.433 --> 01:32:08.644
Give me the gun.

01:32:08.977 --> 01:32:11.522
He got my daddy's watch!
He killed Winston Hancock!

01:32:11.605 --> 01:32:13.649
Don't listen to him. He's crazy.

01:32:13.732 --> 01:32:17.486
- Stop. Think about what you're sayin'.
- I know what I'm sayin'!

01:32:17.569 --> 01:32:20.072
That's the only thing
my daddy ever give me.

01:32:20.155 --> 01:32:22.616
Is there any truth
in what this man is saying?

01:32:22.699 --> 01:32:24.660
What the hell difference does it make?

01:32:24.743 --> 01:32:28.747
At least the state of Mississippi got
40 years of cheap labor out of the deal.

01:32:28.830 --> 01:32:31.625
Motherfucker, you took our lives.
Gimme the gun.

01:32:31.708 --> 01:32:34.586
- I'm gonna kill this motherfucker myself.
- No!

01:32:34.670 --> 01:32:36.338
Put it down, Pike!

01:32:57.692 --> 01:32:59.819
I believe this belongs to me.

01:33:13.416 --> 01:33:15.043
My daddy's watch.

01:33:17.962 --> 01:33:21.382
We were walkin' back.
A bird came out low on our left.

01:33:22.092 --> 01:33:23.593
I swung on it.

01:33:24.219 --> 01:33:27.055
Mr. Pike walked directly in my line of fire.

01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:30.058
Where were the two convicts
when the shot was fired?

01:33:30.141 --> 01:33:34.103
They were loadin' up the truck.
They'd gone on ahead.

01:33:34.771 --> 01:33:36.981
Why don't he just tell him the truth?

01:33:37.065 --> 01:33:40.151
Nobody wanna hear it.
He gonna tell 'em what they wanna hear.

01:33:40.234 --> 01:33:42.779
- I don't know.
- We'll talk.

01:33:49.035 --> 01:33:50.536
Here he comes.

01:33:53.206 --> 01:33:57.460
I think they bought it. One of the deputies
is a member of my church.

01:33:57.919 --> 01:34:00.922
Gibson, I don't think there's any way that...

01:34:04.050 --> 01:34:05.384
...I could, uh...

01:34:06.719 --> 01:34:08.387
Claude...

01:34:10.473 --> 01:34:13.142
There's no way to make up for 40 years.

01:34:15.853 --> 01:34:17.730
I'll get Charlie to...

01:34:18.439 --> 01:34:21.150
...to draw up your pardon papers
in the morning.

01:34:22.943 --> 01:34:26.113
- Would you mind helpin' me upstairs?
- Sure, boss.

01:34:27.406 --> 01:34:29.075
I'm not your boss.

01:34:29.408 --> 01:34:31.702
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.

01:34:34.997 --> 01:34:37.458
So Ray and Claude
get their pardons, right?

01:34:37.541 --> 01:34:39.752
No, ain't get their pardons, man.

01:34:39.835 --> 01:34:44.381
If they got their pardons back then,
we wouldn't be buryin' them today.

01:34:44.798 --> 01:34:46.175
- That's right.
- Damn.

01:34:46.258 --> 01:34:48.761
What happened is old man Wilkins...

01:34:49.303 --> 01:34:51.597
...never come out of the bathroom.

01:34:52.139 --> 01:34:54.850
Sat right there and died on the shitter.

01:34:56.435 --> 01:34:59.021
That must've been pretty messed up
for them.

01:35:00.397 --> 01:35:03.275
What happened to them after that,
old-timer?

01:35:04.401 --> 01:35:06.695
Let's see. What happened after that?

01:35:07.196 --> 01:35:08.447
Oh, yeah!

01:35:08.906 --> 01:35:10.365
They got old.

01:35:13.243 --> 01:35:15.037
Shit. We all got old.

01:35:17.456 --> 01:35:20.375
And getting out
took on a whole new meaning.

01:35:21.210 --> 01:35:23.837
Looks like Jonsey got his walking papers.

01:35:24.087 --> 01:35:25.756
Yeah, there he go.

01:35:26.131 --> 01:35:29.217
Over to the morgue,
up the hill to the cemetery.

01:35:31.011 --> 01:35:34.556
You were right
when you said what you said.

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:37.392
You said we wasn't never
gonna get out of this place.

01:35:37.476 --> 01:35:41.688
And you were right. You said
the only way we gonna get outta here...

01:35:41.938 --> 01:35:44.191
...is through the morgue and the cemetery.

01:35:44.274 --> 01:35:46.943
And you're right, 'cause we right here.

01:35:47.444 --> 01:35:48.945
Right here, right now.

01:35:49.029 --> 01:35:51.239
Yeah, I remember saying that.

01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:54.075
We next. Let's be real.

01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:58.538
We next. You like baseball? We on deck.

01:35:59.206 --> 01:36:02.250
- On deck for what?
- For what? That upper room, nigger.

01:36:02.334 --> 01:36:03.919
'The upper room

01:36:05.170 --> 01:36:06.755
'When Jesus... '

01:36:10.216 --> 01:36:12.969
Know where that is,
the upper room they're singin' about?

01:36:13.053 --> 01:36:15.597
- 'The upper room'
- Yeah, I'll tell you what.

01:36:15.972 --> 01:36:18.933
You die first,
I'm gonna sing at your funeral.

01:36:19.017 --> 01:36:22.854
I'm gonna just bust up
in the motherfucker and go 'Upper room.'

01:36:23.688 --> 01:36:27.484
Let 'em shoot me. I don't give a fuck
if they take me out singin'.

01:36:27.692 --> 01:36:29.819
- You crazy, Ray.
- Hell, yeah.

01:36:33.573 --> 01:36:34.782
Friend.

01:36:35.909 --> 01:36:37.452
Yeah. We next.

01:36:42.373 --> 01:36:44.250
I wanna be at the game. I'm on a roll.

01:36:45.335 --> 01:36:47.462
'Mama and my daddy don't know how'

01:36:47.545 --> 01:36:50.590
Two Percodan. There you go.
Gimme what you got.

01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.342
I'll raise ya.

01:36:53.009 --> 01:36:55.136
Yo, what the fuck are those?

01:36:56.346 --> 01:36:58.598
It helps keep the cholesterol down.

01:36:58.681 --> 01:37:03.478
Do I look like I give a damn
about my cholesterol?

01:37:08.608 --> 01:37:12.111
- You want a bump, G?
- No, I don't want none of that shit.

01:37:12.278 --> 01:37:15.072
- That's right.
- I wouldn't put that in my nose.

01:37:15.156 --> 01:37:17.658
- You know how they get it in here?
- Tell him how.

01:37:17.742 --> 01:37:19.744
People smuggle it in... in their ass.

01:37:19.827 --> 01:37:22.914
- Say what?
- I know the motherfucker that bring it in.

01:37:24.165 --> 01:37:27.418
That come out of somebody's asshole,
so go on, enjoy.

01:37:27.501 --> 01:37:29.170
I know if I got to get high...

01:37:29.253 --> 01:37:31.839
...I got to smell some shit,
I ain't gonna have none.

01:37:31.922 --> 01:37:34.133
That ain't high. That's low.

01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:38.262
That cocaine, heroin, marijuana,
all that shit, bring it all in here...

01:37:38.345 --> 01:37:40.389
...in their ass.

01:37:40.473 --> 01:37:43.142
Look like it's up to you, ass-sniffer.

01:37:43.809 --> 01:37:46.312
Boys, come and get it! Jell-O!

01:37:48.981 --> 01:37:51.192
- Jell-O pudding!
- Play one more hand.

01:37:51.275 --> 01:37:53.194
- I'm gonna get my Jell-O.
- Come on.

01:37:53.277 --> 01:37:57.197
Y'all gonna take all my money and
go run off 'cause nurse said 'Jell-O.'

01:37:57.281 --> 01:37:58.908
- Ray.
- I don't want no Jell-O.

01:37:58.991 --> 01:38:01.118
I ain't said nothin' about the Jell-O.

01:38:01.201 --> 01:38:04.371
I was thinkin' about
what we talked about this afternoon.

01:38:04.455 --> 01:38:06.832
- I think I got a plan.
- You got a plan?

01:38:08.542 --> 01:38:10.294
I'm a visionary on this one.

01:38:10.377 --> 01:38:12.921
- You got it all worked out?
- I think I really do.

01:38:13.005 --> 01:38:14.965
Listen here. Any plan you got...

01:38:15.049 --> 01:38:17.843
...I don't even wanna hear
'cause I know it's fucked up.

01:38:17.926 --> 01:38:19.428
All fucked up.

01:38:19.928 --> 01:38:22.139
If you don't wanna believe me, don't.

01:38:22.514 --> 01:38:26.018
I'm too old. I ain't got time for no plan.
I'm 90 years old.

01:38:26.101 --> 01:38:29.646
I never thought I'd see the day
that old Ray Gibson give up hope.

01:38:29.730 --> 01:38:31.440
- Never thought...
- Say what now?

01:38:31.523 --> 01:38:34.359
I said I never thought I'd hear the day...

01:38:34.776 --> 01:38:36.737
...that old Ray Gibson give up hope.

01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:38.989
I ain't give up no motherfuckin' hope.

01:38:39.072 --> 01:38:42.284
I'm keepin' it real like them niggers
in here keep it real.

01:38:42.367 --> 01:38:44.786
Ain't nobody give up nothin'.

01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:47.622
- You'd probably slow me down anyway.
- Said which?

01:38:47.706 --> 01:38:48.999
You'd slow me down.

01:38:49.082 --> 01:38:51.752
You must be high if you think
I'd slow you down.

01:38:51.835 --> 01:38:55.005
- I got a plan.
- I tell you what. Fuck your plan.

01:38:56.047 --> 01:38:59.301
Lou. Cover that up.
Don't nobody wanna see that shit.

01:38:59.384 --> 01:39:02.554
- Put your drawers on or something.
- Oh, cover it up.

01:39:02.637 --> 01:39:04.306
Don't touch it.

01:39:04.389 --> 01:39:08.393
That turn my stomach. I don't want
no Jell-O after I seen them old-ass balls.

01:39:08.476 --> 01:39:11.771
Who gonna enjoy Jell-O
after I seen what I've seen?

01:39:12.022 --> 01:39:15.025
I don't even want Jell-O.
Lou ruin my stomach.

01:39:32.083 --> 01:39:33.877
Anybody seen Claude?

01:39:37.046 --> 01:39:39.632
I been here the whole time.
He ain't come out.

01:39:39.924 --> 01:39:42.802
- Claude ain't out!
- Claude has died, God!

01:39:45.847 --> 01:39:47.515
No, Ray, don't go!

01:39:51.227 --> 01:39:53.646
- Claude!
- Ray, you can't go in there!

01:39:53.730 --> 01:39:55.690
- Ray, come back!
- Claude!

01:39:58.735 --> 01:39:59.944
Claude!

01:40:12.623 --> 01:40:15.251
- How did it start?
- Probably old wires.

01:40:16.294 --> 01:40:19.088
Place was a tinderbox just waitin' to go.

01:40:19.630 --> 01:40:23.634
I guess we should've torn
this old building down a long time ago.

01:40:23.968 --> 01:40:27.888
Gibson made it this far before
he was probably overcome by smoke.

01:40:28.014 --> 01:40:31.600
From the looks of things,
Banks didn't even make it out of bed.

01:40:36.355 --> 01:40:38.357
You really bummed me out.

01:40:38.983 --> 01:40:40.901
That's a terrible story.

01:40:43.446 --> 01:40:44.572
You cryin'?

01:40:44.655 --> 01:40:47.283
No, I got allergies. I'm cool.

01:40:48.117 --> 01:40:49.577
Oh, my God.

01:40:50.953 --> 01:40:53.998
Ain't nothin' wrong with a man cryin'
every now and again.

01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:57.001
So what was Claude's plan, anyway?

01:40:57.543 --> 01:40:59.420
Claude figured...

01:40:59.587 --> 01:41:02.548
...he could steal a couple of bodies
from the morgue, right?

01:41:02.631 --> 01:41:05.301
That way,
when he set the infirmary on fire...

01:41:05.467 --> 01:41:08.178
...in all the commotion,
him and Ray could just...

01:41:08.429 --> 01:41:10.764
...slip right onto them fire engines, see?

01:41:10.848 --> 01:41:13.017
Hide out, wait until the mornin'...

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:15.519
...and roll right on out with 'em.

01:41:16.228 --> 01:41:19.940
That way, when they find the two bodies,
they think it was them.

01:41:20.023 --> 01:41:22.359
What makes you think that ain't work?

01:41:25.654 --> 01:41:27.781
I never said it didn't work.

01:41:30.117 --> 01:41:33.954
You mean this is not Ray and Claude
in these two boxes?

01:41:36.373 --> 01:41:38.166
Is it, old man?

01:41:40.127 --> 01:41:42.004
Hey, old-timer, is it?

01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:00.480
- See?
- I like that.

01:42:00.564 --> 01:42:03.275
You feel part of this baseball game,
don't you?

01:42:03.483 --> 01:42:05.443
They only get one out of me today.

01:42:05.527 --> 01:42:08.363
We were arguing about something.

01:42:09.156 --> 01:42:12.450
I didn't appreciate
when you said something about...

01:42:13.118 --> 01:42:15.161
You had just said I was...

01:42:16.413 --> 01:42:17.998
You said that, uh...

01:42:19.165 --> 01:42:21.126
Hell with it.

01:42:21.209 --> 01:42:23.128
It's a hell of a day for a ball game.

01:42:23.211 --> 01:42:26.131
- Yankees on fire.
- Motherfuckers kickin' ass.

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:30.135
- Which ones the Yankees?
- Well, the ones up at the mound.

01:42:31.636 --> 01:42:33.263
Go, go, you! Run!

01:42:34.889 --> 01:42:36.766
That's the Yankees right there.

01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:39.602
- Which ones there?
- That's the Yankees right there.

01:42:39.686 --> 01:42:41.604
It's a perfect plan. We're out.

01:42:41.688 --> 01:42:44.566
What's so perfect?
Took 65 years to come up with it.

01:42:44.649 --> 01:42:46.651
Why can't you just say thank you?

01:42:46.734 --> 01:42:49.404
You want me to say thank you,
you can kiss my ass too.

01:42:53.241 --> 01:42:54.867
I'm ready to go back right now.

01:42:56.202 --> 01:42:58.705
Then let's go, Ray.

01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:02.917
Help a nigger!
Don't make me stand in this cold.

01:43:03.001 --> 01:43:05.670
Your bitch'd be standing... I'm sorry.

01:43:06.212 --> 01:43:09.507
Fuck around with me, it's gonna
be consequences and repercussions.

01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:11.384
- What's repercussions?
- Uh-oh.

01:43:21.686 --> 01:43:23.271
Let me get that.

01:43:24.647 --> 01:43:26.274
I know it's 1932.

01:43:26.607 --> 01:43:28.901
I'm the first one to have this.

01:43:31.153 --> 01:43:34.115
Hey, watch... Shit.
I almost got stung by a bee.

01:43:34.949 --> 01:43:37.576
You were scared, huh? Don't be scared.

01:43:38.286 --> 01:43:40.454
Don't be scared, and don't laugh either.

01:43:40.538 --> 01:43:42.415
'Cause it ain't funny.

01:43:43.457 --> 01:43:45.626
That boy got God-given talent.

01:43:45.918 --> 01:43:47.420
God made his...

01:43:49.255 --> 01:43:51.465
What's wrong? The moustache too big?

01:43:55.886 --> 01:43:59.682
He give up hope, hung himself
because of the airplane that's coming over.

01:43:59.765 --> 01:44:02.476
Make me have to loop this shit.
I ain't loopin' shit!

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:04.270
We get it now or not at all!

01:44:04.353 --> 01:44:06.647
My name Jangle Leg, Jangle Leg.

01:44:09.775 --> 01:44:11.652
You think that's funny?

01:44:14.989 --> 01:44:16.907
That's probably the last time. Sorry.

01:44:16.991 --> 01:44:17.950
MY bad.

01:44:20.285 --> 01:44:22.413
This ain't my daddy's watch.
