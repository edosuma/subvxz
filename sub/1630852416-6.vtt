WEBVTT

00:09.242 --> 00:12.645
Your pal was doing some
fundraising the other day.

00:23.790 --> 00:26.092
Here we go now, Alexander.

00:26.126 --> 00:27.927
Why can't you hear
a dinosaur pee?

00:27.961 --> 00:29.596
- Why?
- 'Cause they're extinct.

00:29.629 --> 00:31.765
- How are you now?
- My brother and his sweetie

00:31.798 --> 00:34.100
are getting married, they've
asked me to be their best man.

00:34.134 --> 00:35.635
Congratulations!

00:35.668 --> 00:38.304
Means I'm also in charge
of planning the buck and doe.

00:38.338 --> 00:40.440
We're smack dab in the middle of
buck and doe season.

00:40.473 --> 00:42.342
Better get on renting the Ag
H.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.310
- Ah, she's all booked up.
- Try the Legion?

00:44.344 --> 00:46.279
- She's all booked up.
- Parkview Gardens?

00:46.312 --> 00:48.448
- She's all booked up.
- Could rent the arena floor

00:48.481 --> 00:49.949
depending on how big
the buck and doe is.

00:49.983 --> 00:51.518
Ah, she'll be teensy.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.286
My brother's always been
a bit of a grump.

00:53.319 --> 00:55.388
- And his sweetie's a twat.
- Can't win 'em all.

00:55.455 --> 00:57.791
- So what's the plan?
- Well, listen here, buckaroo.

00:57.824 --> 01:00.960
What we did is we booked out
D.

01:00.994 --> 01:03.296
- Hey, lady Di!
- You got 'er, Pontiac.

01:03.329 --> 01:05.465
There'll also be a raffle draw
and a silent auction.

01:05.498 --> 01:08.468
- How much are the tickets?
- $25 for the steak dinner.

01:08.501 --> 01:10.904
$25 is a bit steep for a steak
dinner, but I guess

01:10.970 --> 01:12.405
you wants to supports
the newlyweds.

01:12.472 --> 01:15.041
You'll have your choice of pop,
water, or tomato juice

01:15.075 --> 01:16.810
- with the steak dinner.
- No beer?

01:16.843 --> 01:19.412
Alcohol's not included in the
price of the steak dinner.

01:19.479 --> 01:21.981
Beer, wine, and spirits may be
purchased at the bar

01:22.015 --> 01:23.750
if you're looking to
bend an elbow.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.318
Well, that's a grumpy twat move.

01:25.351 --> 01:27.654
- Please tip the barmaid.
- Comes with fries?

01:27.687 --> 01:30.156
You'll have your choice of fries
or mashed potatoes

01:30.190 --> 01:32.659
with the steak dinner, as well
as a seasonal vegetable.

01:32.692 --> 01:35.195
- Green beans?
- Think it.

01:35.228 --> 01:36.496
You'd think for 25 bucks,

01:36.529 --> 01:38.231
you'd get some fucking coleslaws
with that.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.333
You show me a striploin with
fries and green beans,

01:40.366 --> 01:42.669
I'll say, "Hey, now that's
a steak dinner."

01:42.702 --> 01:45.205
You'd thinks it'd be a filets
mignons for 25 bucks.

01:45.238 --> 01:47.240
There's always a good portion of
fries at Lady Di's.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.509
Yeah, wash her down with a cold
glass of water.

01:49.542 --> 01:51.511
- Is there dessert?
- You get a bowl

01:51.544 --> 01:53.513
of strawberries and whipped
cream with the steak dinner,

01:53.546 --> 01:55.281
as strawberries are also
in season.

01:55.348 --> 01:56.916
It's just 'cause lots of people
like ice cream

01:56.950 --> 01:58.852
- with their strawberries.
- Well, you're in luck, Chuck.

01:58.885 --> 02:01.955
Diana Sweets carries Chapman's
i.

02:02.021 --> 02:03.389
Oh.

02:03.423 --> 02:05.525
Which may be purchased at the
bar for $1.50.

02:05.558 --> 02:07.427
Jeez, you'd think it'd be
Breyers from out in Simcoe's

02:07.460 --> 02:09.295
- for a buck fifties.
- I'd have the Chapman.

02:09.362 --> 02:11.464
Yeah, but you'd think it'd be
Breyers for a buck fifties.

02:11.531 --> 02:13.233
What are yous raffling off?

02:13.266 --> 02:15.268
Ah, you get one raffle ticket
with the steak dinner,

02:15.301 --> 02:17.237
and the lucky winner gets
a weekend of camping

02:17.270 --> 02:19.472
in Sauble Beach, and I'll wash
your truck for you.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.975
- Sauble Falls or White Sands?
- Winding River.

02:22.041 --> 02:24.310
Jeez, you'd think you'd get
Sauble Falls for 25 bucks.

02:24.377 --> 02:26.379
Is it possible to enter
the raffle and attend

02:26.412 --> 02:28.047
the silent auction without
buying the steak dinner?

02:28.081 --> 02:30.550
Ah, now I've been hearing some
talk around town

02:30.583 --> 02:32.652
that you've gotta buy the steak
dinner in order

02:32.719 --> 02:35.221
to join the raffle or attend
the silent auction.

02:35.255 --> 02:37.323
- That's a GD lie.
- That's good,

02:37.390 --> 02:39.392
'cause you should be ables to
drives up the raffles

02:39.425 --> 02:41.661
and the silent auctions without
buying the steaks dinners.

02:41.728 --> 02:43.630
Yes, but we'd love it if you
joined the bride and groom

02:43.663 --> 02:45.498
- for the steak dinner.
- How're your numbers?

02:45.565 --> 02:47.934
Remember I said he's a grump
and she's a twat?

02:47.967 --> 02:49.569
- Yeah.
- The numbers reflect that.

02:49.602 --> 02:51.571
- Can't win 'em all.
- Numbers are piddly,

02:51.604 --> 02:53.506
so please tell every Tom, Dick,
and Harry you know.

02:53.573 --> 02:56.009
Might be on account of a $25
fucking steak dinner.

02:56.075 --> 02:57.777
Now if you buy a pair of
steak dinners,

02:57.810 --> 03:00.747
we'll knock five dollars off
the second steak dinner.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.081
Hey, now! Ho, now.

03:02.115 --> 03:03.750
What if you get three steak
dinners?

03:03.783 --> 03:06.786
The price of the first and third
steak dinner stays the same,

03:06.819 --> 03:09.322
but you get five dollars off
that middle guy.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.090
All right, you buy the one
steak dinner,

03:11.124 --> 03:13.259
you get five dollars off
the next steak dinner.

03:13.293 --> 03:16.596
Now I'm not trying to bamboozle,
just a bit of ballyhoo

03:16.629 --> 03:18.665
to steer folks towards buying
the pair of steak dinners

03:18.698 --> 03:20.266
instead of just the one
steak dinner.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.868
- Strategies.
- Incentives.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.102
- Synergy.
- Up-sales.

03:23.136 --> 03:24.704
- Marketing.
- Infrastructure.

03:24.771 --> 03:27.040
So hey, who wants to join
a grump and a twat

03:27.106 --> 03:29.375
for a steak dinner, huh?

03:29.442 --> 03:30.610
What do you want to do,
one, two, or three?

03:30.643 --> 03:32.612
- Um... just two.
- Just two?

03:32.645 --> 03:34.214
- Yeah. Okay.
- We'll do two.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.884
Yup, you'd have the pair of
steak dinners.

- Takes one to know one.

05:58.324 --> 05:59.792
That's the pots calling
the kettles black.

05:59.826 --> 06:01.728
- I know you are but what am I?
- Where's Rosie?

06:01.794 --> 06:03.396
She's still sleeping off
yesterday.

06:03.463 --> 06:04.530
She forgetting
what day it is?

06:04.564 --> 06:06.799
Sundays are
for picking stones.

06:06.833 --> 06:09.702
And getting a wee bit banged up
.

06:09.736 --> 06:12.638
- I bought it, I saw it.
- Roll up your sleeves, boys.

06:12.672 --> 06:16.743
But first, "Wade," you forgot to
open your Friday mail.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.478
I open my Friday mail
on Monday.

06:18.511 --> 06:19.746
What if it's pressing?

06:19.812 --> 06:21.547
Nothing that comes by mail is
pressing, Dary.

06:21.581 --> 06:24.817
- What if it's ice cream?
- Wait. What did you says?

06:24.851 --> 06:28.154
I said "Wade" forgot to open his
Friday mail.

06:28.187 --> 06:29.422
That's what
I thought you saids.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.724
And I said, "I open my Friday
mail on Monday."

06:31.758 --> 06:34.193
Well, must not care about the
weekend coupons there, Wayne.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.328
Must be nice.

06:35.361 --> 06:36.896
Why don't you open your mail
now, Wade?

06:36.929 --> 06:38.197
- Wade?
- Wade?

06:38.231 --> 06:39.899
- Wade... a minute.
- 'Sup?

06:39.932 --> 06:41.834
- What'd you call me?
- That's your name, isn't it?

06:41.868 --> 06:44.036
Whoa-ho, Look! Katy's being
a smarty-pants.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.773
- She's being a smarts Alex.
- She better smarten up.

06:46.839 --> 06:49.542
That's who this letter is
addressed to.

06:53.613 --> 06:57.116
Oh. Looks like the Canadian
Wildlife Federation

06:57.183 --> 06:58.785
spelled my name wrong.

06:58.851 --> 07:00.586
That's one way
to get our annual donation.

07:00.620 --> 07:03.756
Yeah, 'cause, like...
my name's not Wade.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.259
Maybe it is Wade.

07:06.292 --> 07:07.627
Hey, fuck you, Gary.

07:07.693 --> 07:09.195
Gary.

07:09.228 --> 07:10.463
Everybody knows Gary
over there.

07:10.530 --> 07:11.964
Yep, there's old Gary,

07:12.031 --> 07:13.533
just chiming in from the peanut
gallery.

07:13.566 --> 07:16.068
Oh, you're the biggest armchair
quarterback there ever was,

07:16.102 --> 07:17.603
- Sadie.
- Sadie?

07:17.637 --> 07:19.872
Oh, everybody knows Sadie's
the biggest backseats drivers.

07:19.906 --> 07:21.974
Sticks and stones,
Squirrelly Don.

07:22.041 --> 07:23.309
Don.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.778
Yeah, where's Professor Tricia
now, Don?

07:25.812 --> 07:28.581
You wanna know what, I think
we're kind of forgetting

07:28.614 --> 07:30.383
that Sundays are
for picking stones.

07:30.416 --> 07:32.718
Yep, can't be all fun
and games, eh, Wade?

07:32.752 --> 07:34.720
- You wanna know what?
- Oh, here comes Gary

07:34.754 --> 07:36.255
with another one of his
big ideas!

07:36.289 --> 07:37.757
More hands makes
for less works.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.893
- Hey, I was gonna say that.
- It sounds like Don

07:40.927 --> 07:42.595
right there was mowing
everybody's lawns.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.797
You thinking what
I'm thinking, Gary?

07:44.831 --> 07:46.265
Great minds think alike, Sadie.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.900
I'll get the truck and we'll
round up some more hands.

07:47.934 --> 07:49.902
Tough task getting people
to help you pick stones.

07:49.936 --> 07:52.405
Like, it's essentially asking
someone to come by

07:52.438 --> 07:53.673
and bend over for you.

07:53.739 --> 07:55.608
- More hands make less work.
- But wait!

07:55.641 --> 07:57.243
When are you gonna
get hammered?

07:57.276 --> 08:00.012
I'll get hammered later.

08:01.781 --> 08:04.283
There's old Sadie, always taking
one for the team.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.585
What do you think, Don?

08:05.618 --> 08:07.520
I thinks they don't pays me
to thinks, Sadies.

08:07.587 --> 08:09.789
- Wade?
- Well, like I always say,

08:09.822 --> 08:11.757
where there's a will,
there's a Wade.

08:11.791 --> 08:14.694
- Pitter patter.
Let's get at 'er.

08:17.930 --> 08:21.934
Chip and Pepper, taking five
o?

08:21.968 --> 08:23.936
Taking five on wheeling your
girls, buddy.

08:23.970 --> 08:27.106
ABC. Always be wheeling your
girls, buddy.

08:29.976 --> 08:32.712
Slow clap for perfunctory
effort, peasants.

08:32.778 --> 08:35.781
But alas, I do believe your
glory is fleeting.

08:35.815 --> 08:39.519
You may have beat us in Chel,
but the VidVok game is ours.

08:39.552 --> 08:41.654
- Mm-hm.
- And we beat you in FIFs.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.723
- More like queefs.
- And we'll beat you here too.

08:43.789 --> 08:46.025
Butt VidVok
may be on the rise.

08:46.058 --> 08:49.562
But dance VidVok will always be
the most popular.

08:49.629 --> 08:51.230
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

08:51.297 --> 08:52.698
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah!

08:52.732 --> 08:55.067
And once our new friend teaches
us everything she knows,

08:55.134 --> 08:58.404
2cock Chakur will be the hottest
dance collective on VidVok.

08:58.471 --> 08:59.405
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

08:59.472 --> 09:00.806
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah!

09:00.840 --> 09:03.075
And once 2cock Chakur is
the hottest dance collective

09:03.142 --> 09:05.978
on VidVok, I'm going to wheel
my girls back.

09:08.147 --> 09:10.483
What do you mean,
"Wheel them back?"

09:10.516 --> 09:12.585
Wheel as in "steal."

09:14.086 --> 09:16.889
You can't wheel them back,
idiot.

09:16.923 --> 09:19.058
- Wheel doesn't mean "steal."
- No?

09:19.091 --> 09:23.062
No, if you're wheeling 'em,
it means you're...

09:23.095 --> 09:24.564
taking 'em down.

09:24.597 --> 09:26.766
Yeah, so like, right now,
we'.

09:26.832 --> 09:29.168
- Oh.
- If you wanted to wheel them,

09:29.201 --> 09:31.604
you would first have to...

09:31.671 --> 09:33.105
- Thieve them.
- Uh, he--

09:33.172 --> 09:34.907
- You would have to theft them.
- Thanks, man.

09:34.941 --> 09:37.743
So you're saying I will have
to steal them from you

09:37.777 --> 09:39.679
and not wheel
them from you?

09:39.712 --> 09:41.714
- Yeah.
- Oh.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.750
Good. Good, good.
I'm glad we cleared that up.

09:44.784 --> 09:46.919
Because I am going to
steal them.

09:46.953 --> 09:47.954
Yeah?

09:48.020 --> 09:49.388
And then I'm going to
wheel them!

09:49.422 --> 09:51.457
Well, you can dance
if you want to.

09:51.524 --> 09:52.792
You can leave you friends
behind!

09:52.858 --> 09:54.260
- Let's go, Jonesy.
- If you need us,

09:54.293 --> 09:56.462
we'll be hiking our shorts up
into our butt cracks,

09:56.529 --> 09:59.231
- making art!
- Butt art!

09:59.265 --> 10:02.301
As much as I would rather
make art, not war,

10:02.368 --> 10:04.971
load your fucking cannons!

10:08.574 --> 10:10.242
How are you now?

10:11.243 --> 10:12.645
Yard sale Sundays.

10:12.712 --> 10:14.213
Not so bad.

10:14.246 --> 10:16.282
Well, except it's Yard Sale
Saturdays.

10:16.315 --> 10:18.317
Sundays are for
picking stones.

10:18.384 --> 10:21.554
Not when Mrs. McMurray orders
a.

10:21.587 --> 10:23.389
And Saturdays are for
picking stones

10:23.422 --> 10:24.557
and Sundays
are for decorating.

10:24.590 --> 10:26.058
That's Mrs. McMurphy, all right.

10:26.092 --> 10:27.560
That's Mrs. McMurphy
right there.

10:27.593 --> 10:28.828
She's gonna take spring
cleaning,

10:28.894 --> 10:30.496
and she's gonna fucking punt it
right to summer.

10:30.563 --> 10:31.964
- Huh?!
- They're hammered.

10:31.998 --> 10:33.899
Oh, here comes in Sadie
with an update,

10:33.933 --> 10:35.401
what you got next for us?
The weather?

10:35.434 --> 10:38.571
- Up next, news and traffic.
- Every hours on the hours.

10:38.604 --> 10:40.840
- Sadie?!
- Fuckin' Sadie, all day,

10:40.906 --> 10:43.643
just fuckin' can't wait to tell
.

10:43.676 --> 10:44.744
Connies!

10:44.777 --> 10:48.514
Oh, Connie McMurphy!

10:48.581 --> 10:50.282
What you gots in the box there,
Connies?

10:50.316 --> 10:51.584
Fuckin', you know Connie.

10:51.617 --> 10:53.085
Always carrying around something
in a box.

10:53.119 --> 10:55.421
Katy, why are they
calling me Connie?

10:55.454 --> 10:58.257
- You mean Sadies?
- Oh, Sa.

10:58.290 --> 11:00.092
What have you got next for us?
You got the weather?

11:00.126 --> 11:01.761
Fuckin' Sadie is a
meteorologist.

11:01.794 --> 11:03.329
I think I'll have what yous
are having.

11:03.362 --> 11:04.864
- They're hammered.
Here you go.

11:04.930 --> 11:06.465
Here's an update, Sadie, why
don't you tell us

11:06.499 --> 11:08.000
about the atmospheric pressure
there?

11:08.034 --> 11:10.102
Yeah, where's the geometric
satellite?

11:10.136 --> 11:12.104
- Ask Wade.
- Well, it's way up

11:12.138 --> 11:14.774
- in the meso...sphere.
- I heard prevailing winds.

11:14.807 --> 11:16.709
- How's visibilities?
- Loos

11:16.776 --> 11:19.945
clouds, Sadie? Looking like
some... cumulonimbi.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.814
Mmm, six notches in the clock.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.283
Oh, here's fucking Mrs. McMurphy
all over again.

11:24.316 --> 11:26.018
If it's a London Dry,
she's your guy!

11:26.052 --> 11:27.219
That's what I always say.

11:27.286 --> 11:28.954
That's Mrs. McMurphys right
theres for you.

11:28.988 --> 11:30.956
She says it a lot,
she'll fucking tell you

11:30.990 --> 11:33.893
- that she says it a lot.
- That's all I know.

11:33.959 --> 11:35.294
Will you guys help us
pick stones?

11:35.327 --> 11:36.696
More hands make less work.

11:36.729 --> 11:38.864
Well, I'd love to help yous with
that cocksucker, Katy--

11:38.898 --> 11:40.466
Sadie!

11:40.499 --> 11:41.867
- Sadie?
- Yeah. I'm Sadie.

11:41.901 --> 11:45.304
That's Wade, Gary, and Don.

11:45.337 --> 11:47.640
Yous better listen up, 'cause
we've got a little rule

11:47.673 --> 11:49.709
around here.

11:49.742 --> 11:51.477
Did you tell 'em?

11:51.510 --> 11:53.512
-
- Oh.

11:53.546 --> 11:58.084
Can't help people who don't know
what their names are.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.019
Oh, that's McMurphy
right there.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.220
He'll spend half the day
telling you

12:01.253 --> 12:02.555
you don't know what
your name is.

12:02.588 --> 12:04.990
Those have been the rules,
and they are staunch.

12:05.024 --> 12:07.827
We gotta sell all this shit we
pulled out of the attic,

12:07.860 --> 12:09.528
basement, barn.

12:12.698 --> 12:13.899
- Can I go?
- No.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.234
- But can I go?
- No.

12:15.267 --> 12:17.670
We won't keep you then.
Have a good one.

12:17.703 --> 12:19.505
Have a good one!

12:19.538 --> 12:21.173
Please, Mrs. McMurphy!

12:21.207 --> 12:24.744
Mrs. McMurphy?
You're a day early, baby.

12:24.777 --> 12:26.512
- Mondays are for role play.
- Eww!

12:26.545 --> 12:29.682
Sundays are for yard sales.

12:29.715 --> 12:33.853
Sundays are for
picking stones!

12:34.754 --> 12:36.756
What do you mean the skids
got a dance gal?

12:36.789 --> 12:39.692
We mean, like,
they got a girl who...

12:39.725 --> 12:41.193
- Dances.
- Yeah.

12:41.227 --> 12:42.895
So they got a girl who dances,
so she's like--

12:42.928 --> 12:44.630
- A dance gal.
- Yeah.

12:44.697 --> 12:47.933
Stewart said that dance VidVok
,

12:47.967 --> 12:49.635
- but we said--
- We need you to be

12:49.702 --> 12:51.070
- the most popular.
- Why?

12:51.103 --> 12:53.706
- 'Cause we're your managers.
- Sick.

12:53.739 --> 12:55.207
- Sick, buddy.
- And as such,

12:55.241 --> 12:57.777
we are entitled to a notable
percentage of your earnings.

12:57.810 --> 12:59.712
- What percentage?
- A notable one.

12:59.745 --> 13:01.213
Moving right along.

13:01.247 --> 13:03.716
The skids say dance VidVok
is the most popular, we agree.

13:03.749 --> 13:05.918
I feel like not enough people
know about butt VidVok yet.

13:05.951 --> 13:09.088
Yeah. See, I agree with Jonesy.

13:09.121 --> 13:12.658
We're the first artisans
of butt art on VidVok.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.059
- Artisans?
- Yeah,

13:14.093 --> 13:15.494
like, craftsmen of butt art.

13:15.561 --> 13:16.896
- Craftspeople.
- Yeah.

13:16.929 --> 13:19.298
We're the first craftspeople
of butt art on VidVok.

13:19.331 --> 13:21.133
- We're buttsmiths.
-

13:21.167 --> 13:24.403
Wow, Aly, we landed a pair
of innovators here.

13:24.436 --> 13:26.238
A real pair of initiators
with this butt art.

13:26.272 --> 13:27.740
- Ground-breakers.
- Torch-bearers.

13:27.773 --> 13:28.908
- Pathfinders.
- Trailblazers.

13:28.941 --> 13:30.943
I still think I prefer
"buttsmiths."

13:30.976 --> 13:34.246
What did we do to land a pair
of catalysts like you?

13:35.981 --> 13:37.750
- Well...
- You know.

13:37.783 --> 13:40.586
- We're wheeling you.
-

13:44.356 --> 13:46.926
- We're wheeling you.
- Pardon?

13:46.959 --> 13:48.761
We are wheeling you.

13:48.794 --> 13:50.329
Girls are into that kind
of thing?

13:50.362 --> 13:51.964
- What do you mean?
- I mean it's been

13:51.997 --> 13:54.266
my understanding that girls
wheeling guys

13:54.300 --> 13:56.268
- is considered to be a bit...
- Unladylike.

13:56.302 --> 13:57.469
- Improper.
- Unsuitable.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.471
- Graceless.
- Yeah.

13:59.505 --> 14:00.539
- Yeah, no.
- No?

14:00.606 --> 14:02.107
- Yeah, no.
- Well, okay.

14:02.141 --> 14:05.444
Like okay full disclosure,
ths

14:05.477 --> 14:06.946
that it's just about sex.

14:06.979 --> 14:08.981
Yeah, that's why we used that
term in this particular--

14:09.014 --> 14:11.617
- These.
- These particular cases.

14:11.650 --> 14:13.285
- Huh.
- Like, okay.

14:13.319 --> 14:15.154
We know you think it's only
a guy thing to want

14:15.187 --> 14:17.056
to have sex with someone with
zero intention

14:17.122 --> 14:18.791
of ever seeing them or speaking
to them again.

14:18.824 --> 14:19.992
Yeah.
- Yeah, no.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.194
We know that for women
to pursue just sex,

14:22.228 --> 14:24.797
as guys so often do,
is considered...

14:24.830 --> 14:26.198
- Unwomanly.
- Unmannerly.

14:26.232 --> 14:28.300
- Haughtenish.
- Indelicate.

14:28.334 --> 14:29.535
- Yeah.
- But no.

14:29.568 --> 14:33.138
You think only guys just want
to get laid?

14:33.172 --> 14:34.874
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no.

14:34.907 --> 14:37.476
To be clear, you are with us
for just sex

14:37.509 --> 14:40.980
and nothing else, right?

14:41.013 --> 14:42.548
Speak freely.

14:42.581 --> 14:44.183
Y-yes?

14:44.216 --> 14:45.751
- Us too.
- Well, not just sex.

14:45.818 --> 14:48.320
Oh no.
Definitely not just sex.

14:48.354 --> 14:50.823
- But then...
- But then...

14:50.856 --> 14:53.392
Look, since we're all
speaking freely here.

14:53.425 --> 14:56.161
Okay, well, first,
we love your butts.

14:56.195 --> 14:58.397
Oh, hockey players
have the best butts.

14:58.430 --> 14:59.398
- Mm-hm.
- Mmm.

14:59.431 --> 15:00.566
-
- But--

15:00.599 --> 15:03.102
Besides your butts,
we are just with you

15:03.168 --> 15:05.004
so we can ride your
coattails to the top.

15:05.037 --> 15:08.073
Yep, the very top of butt
art VidVok.

15:09.775 --> 15:12.444
- Sick!
- Sick, buddy!

15:12.511 --> 15:15.047
So if dance VidVok will always
be the most popular...

15:15.080 --> 15:16.248
It's time to broaden
your niche.

15:16.282 --> 15:17.783
- Absolutely
- Hundy P.

15:17.850 --> 15:21.020
- Wheel, snipe, celly, boys.
- Dirty fucking dangles, boys.

15:21.053 --> 15:22.421
- What's a niche?
- Yeah, I don't know

15:22.454 --> 15:25.557
what a niche is, but I'm all for
broadening it, though.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.627
- It is something you eat, right?
- Let's dance, boys.

15:28.694 --> 15:29.862
- Mmm.
- Mm-hm.

15:29.895 --> 15:31.530
- Mmmm.
- Mm-hmm.

15:35.968 --> 15:38.203
Single file, boys!

15:39.238 --> 15:41.941
There goes Sadie, ol' Captain
Rules of the Road!

15:41.974 --> 15:43.876
- Who's Sadie?
- Shut up, Gary!

15:43.909 --> 15:46.812
- What are yous doing?
- I'm training him.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.747
- Looking good, coach.
- Thanks, brother!

15:48.781 --> 15:51.216
Been going stupid hard at
the gym, you probably can tell

15:51.250 --> 15:53.385
- by my bod, though.
Can confirm.

15:53.419 --> 15:55.721
Yeah, the woman who owns
the gym, she says

15:55.754 --> 15:57.957
I'm there more than she is!
Is that right?

15:57.990 --> 15:59.658
And she owns the gym!

15:59.725 --> 16:01.894
I'll have this guy squatting six
plates by Thanksgiving.

16:01.927 --> 16:04.063
Combine that with eating
less plates at Thanksgiving

16:04.096 --> 16:05.597
and you're laughing!

16:05.631 --> 16:08.968
Oh, that's classic Sadie for
you, handing out food advice.

16:09.001 --> 16:11.503
You should be a diet
doctor-tician.

16:11.570 --> 16:14.606
Yeah, go carbo load, Sadie!

16:14.640 --> 16:18.077
Hey, what school d'you go to to
become a diet statistician?

16:18.110 --> 16:20.012
Sit down, Don!

16:20.079 --> 16:21.413
What's with all
the Shelbyville names?

16:21.447 --> 16:23.582
- Tell him, Wade.
- I'd fucking like to,

16:23.615 --> 16:26.185
but I've been sitting back here
for three fifths of a minute

16:26.251 --> 16:29.088
trying to think of names that
sound like Tyson and Coach,

16:29.121 --> 16:31.757
and I've come up dry
as a fart.

16:31.790 --> 16:34.093
Tyson!

16:34.126 --> 16:35.794
- Dyson!
- The vacuum?

16:35.828 --> 16:37.162
You mean the hairdryer?

16:37.196 --> 16:39.098
Got one of those fancy dryers
down at the gym.

16:39.131 --> 16:42.434
Coach. Poach. Roach.

16:42.468 --> 16:44.370
There's just no approach.

16:44.436 --> 16:46.205
You guys want to help us
pick stones?

16:46.271 --> 16:47.539
More hands make less work.

16:47.606 --> 16:49.875
Sorry, got another 8k
before the sun goes down.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.443
Good enough. Adios!

16:51.477 --> 16:54.680
Sundays are
for picking stones!

16:59.151 --> 17:02.154
The woman who owns the gym
should be there the most,

17:02.187 --> 17:05.557
don't you know? She said it,
I didn't say it.

17:05.624 --> 17:07.226
Sure.

17:07.292 --> 17:09.294
But she should be.

17:15.334 --> 17:17.302
- Connor.
- Stewart.

17:17.336 --> 17:20.472
- Darien.
- Stewart.

17:20.506 --> 17:23.842
Let's see how productive Beavis
and Butt Art have been.

17:43.429 --> 17:44.663
Huh.

17:44.696 --> 17:46.865
They appear to be flexing
their butt cheeks

17:46.899 --> 17:50.903
to the beat
of the music now.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.775
Hey, thanks for doing
this before you head up north,

17:56.842 --> 17:58.343

17:58.377 --> 18:00.179
Yeah, thanks for doing
this before you left, buddy.

18:00.212 --> 18:02.681
Give your balls a tug,

20:10.008 --> 20:11.977
- That's Lady C.

20:12.010 --> 20:13.011
- Stewart.
- Can't you see--

20:13.045 --> 20:14.880
We want you.

20:14.913 --> 20:17.716
- But, uh, you don't want me?
No.

20:17.749 --> 20:19.151
- JONESY/
You don't want us?

20:19.184 --> 20:21.587
- Fuck no.
- But she is with us.

20:21.653 --> 20:23.021
What does that mean exactly?

20:23.055 --> 20:25.891
It means if you want her,
you have to go through me.

20:25.924 --> 20:27.159
Yeah, no.

20:27.192 --> 20:28.493
What's the first rule
of business?

20:28.527 --> 20:29.995
Location, location,
location.

20:30.028 --> 20:32.831
No, no, no. That's real estate,
buddy. So stupid.

20:32.864 --> 20:35.100
It's deny, deny, deny.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.369
- That's law.
- Oh, uh, ABC.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.338
Always be finishing deals.

20:39.371 --> 20:41.907
It's always skip
the middle man.

20:41.940 --> 20:44.543
- So, Stewart.
- Bianca-donk.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.012
- Stewart.
- Alycat.

20:47.045 --> 20:48.714
You're a man, right?

20:50.716 --> 20:52.017
Yes...

20:52.050 --> 20:53.619
And you're in the middle?

20:54.953 --> 20:56.188
Yes.

20:56.221 --> 20:57.856
- Skip.
- Skip.

20:57.889 --> 20:58.957
Fuck.

21:01.126 --> 21:02.594
And we're done
wheeling you now.

21:02.628 --> 21:05.364
- You don't want my butt?
- You don't want my butt art?

21:05.397 --> 21:07.466
Yeah, no.

21:11.403 --> 21:14.940
Well, hockey, neither of us
got the girls.

21:14.973 --> 21:17.042
What girls?

21:17.075 --> 21:19.811
Alycat and Bianca-donk.

21:19.878 --> 21:23.115
Right. I almost forgot
about them.

21:23.148 --> 21:24.650
- Excuse me?
- What?

21:24.716 --> 21:26.051
Explain.

21:27.719 --> 21:31.423
Oh, okay, okay, so you know
how we smash, like...

21:31.456 --> 21:34.626
- like, a ton of broads?
- Okay.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.495
Letterkenny being a small town
and everything, well,

21:36.561 --> 21:39.064
we've been kind of running out
of broads to smash.

21:39.097 --> 21:40.565
Okay.

21:40.599 --> 21:42.634
But then Alycat and
Badonk-a-donk

21:42.668 --> 21:46.571
got us doing butt videos
on VidVok.

21:46.605 --> 21:50.942
And boys, it is a whole new
world of DMs.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.745
Might be the most active
DMing we've ever done.

21:53.779 --> 21:56.615
There's broads pole dancing
on there, boys.

21:56.648 --> 21:59.985
Do you... do you realize
what that means?

22:00.018 --> 22:03.755
- No.
- DMing pole dancers.

22:03.789 --> 22:05.924
What's the first rule
of VidVok, boys?

22:05.957 --> 22:07.626
Uh, I...I don't know.

22:07.659 --> 22:11.930
ABC.
Always be DMing broads.

22:11.963 --> 22:12.964
Nice.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.435

22:25.310 --> 22:27.846
- Eww...
- Come on, Stalwart.

22:27.879 --> 22:29.147
Stalwart?

22:29.181 --> 22:30.615
That's actually a rare
compliment.

22:30.649 --> 22:32.351
It's actually a pretty good
time, we'll get hammered.

22:32.384 --> 22:33.719
- You get hammered?
- Well, yeah,

22:33.785 --> 22:35.354
no one's operating a fuckin'
motor vehicle.

22:35.387 --> 22:37.456
Fuckin' heavy machinery.

22:37.489 --> 22:38.790
What's your fuckin'
name again?

22:38.824 --> 22:41.393
- Oh, he's Reilly.
- And he's Jonesy.

22:41.460 --> 22:43.061
And we'll get hammered.

22:43.128 --> 22:44.396
Well, saddle up, boys.

22:44.463 --> 22:45.997
Saddle up!

22:47.132 --> 22:50.235
Come on, skids.
