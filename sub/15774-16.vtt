00:01.801 --> 00:04.269
- I'm going
to the grocery store.

00:04.271 --> 00:06.871
- Oh, wait. Here.

00:08.240 --> 00:11.543
It's just a few things.

00:14.213 --> 00:16.414
- A few things, huh?

00:16.416 --> 00:20.085
What do you need
with 16 tubes of lip balm?

00:20.087 --> 00:21.886
You don't have lips.

00:21.888 --> 00:23.188
- It's not for my lips.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.889
- I don't want to know.

00:24.891 --> 00:27.392
Well, what's this,
a drawing?

00:27.394 --> 00:29.227
- Yeah, I need
some of those, uh,

00:29.229 --> 00:32.197
I forget what they're called.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.798
- Eggs?

00:33.800 --> 00:36.067
- Eggs! How do you
remember that?

00:36.069 --> 00:37.869
- I take it you don't have
any money.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.739
- Oh, thank you.
Add that to the list, too.

01:05.664 --> 01:10.034
- What are these things? Oh, no.

01:10.169 --> 01:13.905
Uh, excuse me.
Where are the carrots?

01:13.907 --> 01:15.607
- In your hand.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.976
- No, not these.
The real ones.

01:17.978 --> 01:20.779
The big ones.
You know, with the stems.

01:20.781 --> 01:24.249
- Oh, yeah. We don't
carry those anymore.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.751
- What do you mean,
you don't carry those anymore?

01:26.753 --> 01:28.453
- No one was buyin' 'em.

01:28.455 --> 01:29.754
- I was buyin' 'em.

01:29.756 --> 01:30.955
- What's wrong with those?

01:30.957 --> 01:32.891
- Peeled, bite-sized,

01:32.893 --> 01:35.026
Baby carrot neeblers?

01:35.028 --> 01:36.027
- Nibblers.

01:36.029 --> 01:37.529
- I don't care what
they're called.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.697
I'm not a baby.
I'm a grown rabbit.

01:39.699 --> 01:41.032
I can chew my own carrots.

01:41.034 --> 01:44.469
- Well, they're not pre-chewed.
They're just bite-sized.

01:44.471 --> 01:45.703
- Well, I'm not buying 'em.

01:45.705 --> 01:47.939
- Ok.
- No, it's not ok.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.475
Because you are losing
my business.

01:50.477 --> 01:52.710
And I was going to buy
a lot of stuff.

01:52.712 --> 01:53.945
I got a big ol' list here.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.749
I was going to buy, uh,
500 yards of sheet metal.

01:57.751 --> 01:58.817
- We don't sell sheet metal.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.819
- Not to me, you don't.
You know what else

02:00.821 --> 02:02.687
You're not going to sell me?

02:02.689 --> 02:06.524
Seven dozen cans
of dolphin unsafe tuna.

02:06.526 --> 02:08.860
Why? Because I'm not
coming back here.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.129
I'm going to grow
my own carrots.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.865
You hear me?
I'm taking a stand.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.233
Because if you stand
for nothing,

02:15.235 --> 02:19.304
Then you're surely going
to fall for anything.

02:22.074 --> 02:25.877
Heh heh heh!

02:27.012 --> 02:29.781
[vocalizing]

03:00.713 --> 03:03.481
- Where did you get
all those carrots?

03:03.483 --> 03:06.050
- You're kidding.
I've been gardening every day

03:06.052 --> 03:07.218
For the past three months.

03:07.220 --> 03:08.953
- No, you haven't.
I hang out with you

03:08.955 --> 03:12.223
From the second I wake up
until the second I go to sleep.

03:12.225 --> 03:13.791
You don't do anything.

03:13.793 --> 03:14.859
- What time do you wake up?

03:14.861 --> 03:17.462
- I don't know,
4:00 p.M. Maybe 4:30.

03:17.464 --> 03:20.698
- Yeah. I do it before then.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.066
- Hey, guys.

03:22.068 --> 03:24.769
- We're in the kitchen.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.738
- I have exciting news.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.773
- You're moving.
- What?! No!

03:28.775 --> 03:32.110
- You're sick with something,
like a weird airborne something,

03:32.112 --> 03:33.144
And you're the first one

03:33.146 --> 03:35.480
To get it, but everybody's
going to get it.

03:35.482 --> 03:36.281
- No!

03:36.283 --> 03:38.583
- You're a robot
disguised as a pig,

03:38.585 --> 03:40.385
And your eyes are video cameras.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.719
- No, stop guessing.

03:41.787 --> 03:44.122
- Well, then, you're moving.
What else is there?

03:44.124 --> 03:45.890
- I got a catering job!

03:45.892 --> 03:47.392
- What's exciting about that?

03:47.394 --> 03:50.728
- I'm catering on the set
of a tv commercial.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.464
- A tv commercial?
How exciting.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.700
Why didn't you tell us
you had exciting news?

03:55.702 --> 03:57.869
- Congratulations, porky.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.904
- It's a big opportunity.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.272
So my food's got to be great.

04:01.274 --> 04:04.442
- Well, if you want the carrots,
I got a whole bunch of 'em.

04:04.444 --> 04:06.911
- Oh, you know, I haven't
chosen a dessert yet.

04:06.913 --> 04:10.882
Maybe I can make
my grandmother's
carrot cake recipe.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.717
- Well, there you go.

04:13.485 --> 04:15.720
- Mmm! They're so sweet.

04:15.722 --> 04:18.890
These will be perfect.
Thanks, bugs.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.757
- So what's the commercial for?

04:20.760 --> 04:22.125
- Clean and shiny hair gel.

04:22.128 --> 04:24.796
- Oh, that's my brand.
Can I come to the shoot?

04:24.798 --> 04:26.965
- I...Don't know.
- Come on.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.367
I bet they'll have
free samples.

04:29.369 --> 04:31.235
- Uh, um, uh--
- please?!

04:31.237 --> 04:34.272
I promise I won't
get in the way.

04:35.641 --> 04:38.242
- Will somebody
get this duck out of the way.

04:38.244 --> 04:40.411
- Psst, daffy!

04:40.413 --> 04:43.147
- What? I'm barely in the shot.

04:43.149 --> 04:47.051
- Daffy, you promised
you'd stay out of the way.

04:47.053 --> 04:49.053
- I never said that.
- Action!

04:49.055 --> 04:54.125
- When I reach for hair gel,
I reach for clean and shiny.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.860
- And cut.

04:55.862 --> 04:57.295
Great job, everybody.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.863
[bell rings]

04:58.865 --> 05:00.698
- That's it? He's done?

05:00.700 --> 05:02.633
He said one line!

05:02.635 --> 05:05.770
Hey, how much do you think
that guy gets paid?

05:05.772 --> 05:06.371
- A lot.

05:06.373 --> 05:09.941
- A lot of money
for barely any work.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.909
Porky, I have exciting news.

05:11.911 --> 05:14.312
- You're going to try
to be a commercial actor?

05:14.314 --> 05:17.448
- Don't guess.
That's so rude.
Who does that?

05:17.450 --> 05:20.985
But yes, I'm going to try
to be a commercial actor.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.021
Let's see here.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.789
Ooh, this looks like
a good audition.

05:24.791 --> 05:27.058
Mighty wheat breakfast cereal.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.061
Actor wanted
for national campaign.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.230
Looking for likeable males,

05:32.232 --> 05:35.700
Charismatic,
friendly dad-types.

05:35.702 --> 05:38.369
That's me!

05:38.371 --> 05:41.973
- Someone from genco called.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.141
- What's genco?

05:43.143 --> 05:44.475
- The company that makes

05:44.477 --> 05:45.710
Clean and shiny hair gel.

05:45.712 --> 05:47.979
They said they wanted
to talk to me about my food.

05:47.981 --> 05:51.549
They said it's urgent! Ahh.
I bet they hated it.

05:51.551 --> 05:52.984
- What? Ah, for all you know,

05:52.986 --> 05:54.752
They're calling to tell you
they loved it.

05:54.754 --> 05:56.754
Maybe they want
to hire you again.

05:56.756 --> 05:58.623
- You think so?
- No way.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.958
They said it's urgent.
That's never good news.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.795
I bet a bunch of people
got sick from your food.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.531
Maybe someone died.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.032
This is bad, porky.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.601
This is really bad.

06:10.603 --> 06:11.803
- Ohh!

06:11.805 --> 06:12.703
- Well, I'm off

06:12.705 --> 06:14.806
To my first commercial
audition. Wish me luck.

06:14.808 --> 06:19.210
- Just call.
I'm sure it's fine.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.378
[dialing]

06:20.380 --> 06:21.712
[line ringing]
- it's ringing.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.414
I'm going to hang up.

06:23.416 --> 06:25.383
- Don't hang up.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.319
- Oh, yes, hi, this is porky pig

06:28.321 --> 06:30.321
Returning your call.

06:30.323 --> 06:34.192
Yes, I'm the one
who made the carrot cake.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.627
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

06:36.629 --> 06:40.298
They all did?
Even the head of the company?

06:40.300 --> 06:41.265
- They got sick?

06:41.267 --> 06:43.034
- Oh, but it's not just me.

06:43.036 --> 06:47.205
I mean, my friend,
bugs bunny grew the carrots.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.973
- What?! Don't get me involved!

06:48.975 --> 06:52.710
- Oh, yeah. None of this
would have happened
without bugs.

06:52.712 --> 06:55.746
- You made the cake!
It's your fault!

06:55.748 --> 06:59.484
- Bunny. B-u-n-n-y.

06:59.486 --> 07:00.885
- Hang up, hang up!

07:00.887 --> 07:03.221
- Ok. We'll be in touch.

07:03.455 --> 07:06.390
- You'll be in touch!
Not me, you.

07:06.392 --> 07:07.391
- Bye-bye.

07:07.393 --> 07:10.628
- Why did you get me involved?
I don't want to be involved.

07:10.630 --> 07:15.133
- It's too late.
You're already involved.

07:19.938 --> 07:23.474
- Bugs? I think you're going
to want to sit down for this.

07:23.476 --> 07:24.475
- Oh, boy.

07:24.477 --> 07:26.144
- They loved it!
- Say what?

07:26.146 --> 07:29.480
- They said it was the best
carrot cake they've ever had.

07:29.482 --> 07:30.982
They want to sell it in stores.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.417
- What do you mean?
I thought they made hair gel.

07:33.419 --> 07:36.687
- Genco's a giant company.
They make everything.

07:36.689 --> 07:37.889
- Well, that's great, porky,

07:37.891 --> 07:39.857
But what does this
have to do with me?

07:39.859 --> 07:41.959
- It wasn't just my recipe.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.795
It was your carrots.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.797
We're a team.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.799
They're going
to send over a contract.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.301
We're going to be rich!

07:50.303 --> 07:52.036
We're going to be rich.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.271
We are going to be rich.

07:53.273 --> 07:56.774
- We're going to be rich!
We're going to be rich!

07:56.776 --> 07:57.875
We're going to be rich!

07:57.877 --> 08:00.244
- If you're not eating
mighty wheats,

08:00.246 --> 08:02.713
You're not eating breakfast.

08:02.715 --> 08:03.748
Oh, that sounds weird.

08:03.750 --> 08:06.250
If you're not eating
mighty wheats,

08:06.252 --> 08:08.553
You're not eating breakfast.

08:08.555 --> 08:11.722
Or, if you're not
eating mighty, wheats?

08:11.724 --> 08:14.025
You're not eating breakfast.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.960
Yep, that sounds good.

08:15.962 --> 08:18.095
- Daffy duck.

08:23.735 --> 08:26.737
- Name?
- Daffy sheldon duck.

08:26.739 --> 08:28.306
- Profile?
- Ok.

08:28.308 --> 08:31.108
Well, I like to think of myself
as an outgoing type,

08:31.110 --> 08:32.710
But I have a serious side, too.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.544
I love reading, thai food--

08:34.547 --> 08:37.081
- No, we need
to see your profile.

08:37.082 --> 08:39.250
- Ahh.

08:39.751 --> 08:41.818
- Ohh, that's a big beak!

08:41.821 --> 08:45.823
- Thank you,
it gets the job done.

08:45.891 --> 08:47.458
- Ok, when I say, "action,"

08:47.460 --> 08:50.428
You'll take a bite of cereal
and then say your line.

08:50.430 --> 08:53.064
- Let me just warm up
my voice for a second.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.799
¶ mi mi mi mi mi mi

08:54.801 --> 08:57.535

08:58.738 --> 09:00.137

09:00.139 --> 09:02.607
[vocalizing and scatting]

09:02.609 --> 09:04.775
Ok, I'm ready.

09:04.777 --> 09:06.644
- Action.

09:06.646 --> 09:07.478
- Ugh! Oh!

09:07.480 --> 09:11.749
This is the worst taste
I've ever had in my mouth!

09:11.751 --> 09:13.784
What is this made of?
Is it dirt?

09:13.786 --> 09:17.121
Oh, my lord, my lord.
This is awful.

09:17.123 --> 09:19.790
Is it supposed
to taste like this?

09:19.792 --> 09:21.425
I mean, who would eat this?

09:21.427 --> 09:25.529
Have any of you tried this?
This is shocking!

09:25.531 --> 09:28.899
Anyway. If you're not
eating mighty, wheats?

09:28.901 --> 09:31.902
You're not eating breakfast.

09:31.904 --> 09:35.439
- Here's the contract
from genco.

09:35.441 --> 09:38.209
What do you think?
Should we sign it?

09:38.211 --> 09:39.910
- I don't even understand it.

09:39.912 --> 09:42.446
I mean, "whereby,
the party of the first part

09:42.448 --> 09:46.250
Agrees to sell to the party
of the second part..."

09:46.252 --> 09:47.818
- Is that the carrot cake?

09:47.820 --> 09:50.755
- "however, the party
of the first part

09:50.757 --> 09:52.089
"represents and warrants

09:52.091 --> 09:54.725
To the party
of the second part..."

09:54.727 --> 09:57.762
This is a very confusing party.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.430
- Hey.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.398
- Oh, how'd it go?

10:00.400 --> 10:01.699
- They said my audition was,

10:01.701 --> 10:05.269
Quote, "unlike anything
they'd ever seen before."

10:05.271 --> 10:07.405
- Ooh. So you got the part?

10:07.407 --> 10:09.140
- No. But I'm going
to get this one.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.242
I'm so right for it,
it's crazy.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.977
"comfort silk pantyhose--

10:12.979 --> 10:14.912
"because no matter
how hard I work,

10:14.914 --> 10:16.947
I still want
to feel like a lady."

10:16.949 --> 10:20.217
- I'm pretty sure that part's
for a woman.

10:20.219 --> 10:22.753
- What?
- We have exciting news.

10:22.755 --> 10:25.089
- You're both moving.
- No!

10:25.091 --> 10:27.191
Genco wants to buy
our carrot cake.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.860
But we can't make heads
or tails of this contract.

10:29.862 --> 10:32.263
- You should have
that big fat rooster
take a look at it.

10:32.265 --> 10:36.233
- Foghorn?
Isn't he a little...Nutty?

10:36.235 --> 10:37.301
- He's a lot nutty.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.137
But he's also the world's
richest rooster.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.907
- Huh. Maybe it wouldn't hurt.

10:42.909 --> 10:43.708
- All right.

10:43.710 --> 10:46.477
- Ooh, I better get
to my audition.

10:46.845 --> 10:51.782
What? You're the one who said
the part was for a woman.

10:54.219 --> 10:55.720
- Mm-hmm.

10:55.722 --> 10:58.456
Ok, uh, a pretty
standard contract.

10:58.458 --> 11:01.125
I'll say,
pretty standard contract.

11:01.226 --> 11:03.127
- So you think
it's a fair deal?

11:03.129 --> 11:05.363
- Well, I'd say
it's more than fair.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.732
This is an incredibly
generous offer.

11:07.734 --> 11:10.735
- Well, thank you so much
for your time.

11:10.737 --> 11:14.205
- Thank you,
I say thank you for the cake.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.407
- Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

11:16.409 --> 11:17.575
- We're going to be rich!

11:17.577 --> 11:20.144
- ¶ we're going to be rich,
we're going to be rich! ¶

11:20.146 --> 11:23.614
- Hold it right there.

11:23.616 --> 11:26.150
Do not, I say do not,

11:26.152 --> 11:28.486
Sign that contract.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.321
- But you said
it was a generous offer.

11:30.323 --> 11:34.658
- That was before I tried
this here cake. Mmm.

11:34.660 --> 11:36.727
I say, mm-hmm!

11:36.729 --> 11:37.928
Why, that offer's insulting

11:37.930 --> 11:40.865
For something
that tastes this good.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.466
- So what are you saying?

11:42.468 --> 11:45.403
- I'm saying, you should
tear up that contract

11:45.405 --> 11:47.571
And go into business
for yourselves.

11:47.573 --> 11:52.042
Why, you'd make ten times,
I say, ten times as much money.

11:52.044 --> 11:55.780
Boys...You're about
to be really rich.

11:55.782 --> 11:58.416
- ¶ we're going
to be really rich!

11:58.418 --> 11:59.817
¶ we're going
to be really rich! ¶

11:59.819 --> 12:01.419
¶ we're going
to be really rich! ¶

12:01.421 --> 12:03.821
- ¶ you're going to be
really rich, you're going
to be really rich ¶

12:03.823 --> 12:07.391
¶ I said, you're going
to be really rich ¶

12:11.763 --> 12:13.764
- All right, here we are.

12:13.766 --> 12:17.902
Our first meeting as partners
in the, uh--huh.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.137
Well, I guess that's
our first order of business,

12:20.139 --> 12:22.706
Naming our carrot cake company.

12:22.708 --> 12:23.741
- Well, on that note,

12:23.743 --> 12:27.912
I hope you don't mind,
but I already started
kicking around some ideas.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.548
I was so excited,
I stayed up all night, and--

12:30.550 --> 12:32.817
- Before we look at that,
I just want to say

12:32.819 --> 12:35.920
How thankful I am
for our friendship.

12:35.922 --> 12:36.587
- Me, too.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.955
None of this would be happening
without it.

12:37.957 --> 12:42.626
- Now, let's see
what my friend's been
working on all night.

12:42.861 --> 12:46.297
- Well?

12:46.299 --> 12:47.865
- Old pig cake?

12:47.867 --> 12:51.936
You stayed up all night
and came up with old pig cake?

12:51.938 --> 12:53.370
- You don't like it?

12:53.372 --> 12:54.371
- What does it even mean?

12:54.373 --> 12:56.574
- Well, the "old"
is for old fashioned,

12:56.576 --> 12:58.642
'cause it's
my grandmother's recipe.

12:58.644 --> 13:01.812
And the "pig,"
well, that was her last name.

13:01.814 --> 13:05.249
And "cake,"
because it's cake.

13:05.251 --> 13:07.384
- I'm sorry.
But "old pig cake"

13:07.386 --> 13:09.753
Just sounds like cake
that's been sitting in the mud

13:09.755 --> 13:11.489
For a really long time.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.491
- Well, what would you call it?

13:13.493 --> 13:16.460
- I don't know. Cc cake?

13:16.462 --> 13:17.962
- Eh, cc cake?

13:17.964 --> 13:19.964
What does that mean?

13:19.966 --> 13:22.299
- You know, cc, carrot cake.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.702
- Yeah, but you said cc cake.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.804
That's a carrot cake cake.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.873
That doesn't even make sense.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.875
- It's better than old pig cake.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.543
- So what are you saying?

13:32.545 --> 13:34.778
- I'm saying I'm not
putting my carrots

13:34.780 --> 13:37.548
Into something with the words
"old" and "pig" on it.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.717
- Well, I'm not going
to bake something

13:39.719 --> 13:41.752
That has the word "cake"
on it twice.

13:41.754 --> 13:42.987
- Fine.
- Fine.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.288
- Hey!

13:44.290 --> 13:45.289
Do you mind?!

13:45.291 --> 13:46.790
Some of us are trying to sleep!

13:46.792 --> 13:49.059
- It's 4:45 in the afternoon.

13:49.061 --> 13:50.694
- [gasps] I've overslept!

13:50.696 --> 13:52.763
I'm late for my audition!

13:52.765 --> 13:54.798
Oh! Ooh! Ooh-ho!

13:54.800 --> 13:59.703
Fresh brite.
It whitens while it brightens.

14:01.506 --> 14:04.942
Simply roll your way
to sexy abs.

14:04.944 --> 14:07.645
[grunting and groaning]

14:07.647 --> 14:10.614
[coughs]

14:11.650 --> 14:12.483
[yawns]

14:12.485 --> 14:15.386
Nothing wakes me up
like a fresh cup

14:15.388 --> 14:17.555
Of cisero's coffee.

14:17.557 --> 14:18.722
Oh! Ow!

14:18.724 --> 14:20.391
Ahh!

14:20.393 --> 14:23.727
[grunting and groaning]

14:23.729 --> 14:25.529
Big bubble bubble gum.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.732
The flavor goes on and on.

14:30.168 --> 14:31.368
[pop]

14:31.370 --> 14:34.705
[muffled grunting and groaning]

14:37.042 --> 14:40.778
[grunting and groaning]

14:40.780 --> 14:42.980
Gloria's cleaning spray.

14:42.982 --> 14:47.284
There is no surface
it can't clean.

14:52.324 --> 14:55.326
[screaming]

14:59.064 --> 15:01.398
- What do you think?

15:01.400 --> 15:02.866
- What do you think?

15:02.868 --> 15:05.869
- It's old fashioned,
but it doesn't feel old.

15:05.871 --> 15:07.972
- And we're both
equally represented.

15:07.974 --> 15:10.407
- We even gave a nod
to your grandmother.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.610
- I like it.
- I like it, too.

15:12.612 --> 15:15.746
Mrs. Porkybunny's carrot cake.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.816
- Ooh, this is so exciting.
We have a name!

15:18.818 --> 15:20.751
- See what happens
when we compromise?

15:20.753 --> 15:23.420
- You're right.
From here on out,

15:23.422 --> 15:24.588
No more arguing.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.890
- That's right.
No more arguing.

15:26.892 --> 15:31.895
Now, how do we get
mrs. Porkybunny's
name out there?

15:32.130 --> 15:35.866
I was thinking...Billboards.

15:35.868 --> 15:36.734
- Billboards?

15:36.736 --> 15:38.802
- Yeah! You know,
you're stuck in traffic,

15:38.804 --> 15:41.605
You're hungry.
You look up, and there we are.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.273
Pop in the store,
pick one up.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.775
- But that's so impersonal.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.810
- Oh, really?
Then what were you thinking?

15:46.812 --> 15:49.613
- I was thinking more
of a door to door approach.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.048
You know, neighbor to neighbor.

15:51.050 --> 15:52.449
- Oh, that's a great idea.

15:52.451 --> 15:56.153
Then maybe in 200 or 300 years,
we'll actually turn a profit.

15:56.155 --> 15:58.622
- Is this your idea
of a compromise?

15:58.624 --> 16:00.824
- Sorry, but I'm not
walking all over town

16:00.826 --> 16:02.493
Ringing doorbells
with a cake in my hand.

16:02.727 --> 16:04.695
- Well, I don't want
my grandma's recipe

16:04.697 --> 16:06.964
Plastered on the side
of a dirty freeway!

16:06.966 --> 16:09.800
- Oh, now you have
a problem with dirt,

16:09.802 --> 16:11.135
Mr. Dirty pig cake.

16:11.137 --> 16:15.139
- It was old pig cake.
There was nothing
dirty about it!

16:15.141 --> 16:17.875
- Mrs. Porkybunny's?

16:17.877 --> 16:18.709
Ha ha ha ha!

16:18.711 --> 16:20.778
That's the worst thing
I've ever heard!

16:20.780 --> 16:22.780
It makes me think of some
weird mutant pig rabbit,

16:22.782 --> 16:27.618
Like it's going to have
little bits of cotton tail
and hooves in there.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.720
- Is there some place else
you can be right now?

16:29.722 --> 16:32.790
- As a matter of fact, I have
a big commercial audition.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.459
It's for an anti diarrheal
medication.

16:35.461 --> 16:40.964
"the next time you get diarrhea,
you might just think of me.

16:40.966 --> 16:43.100
- Wait a second.

16:43.102 --> 16:44.468
We should do a commercial.

16:44.470 --> 16:45.869
We'll reach millions of people,

16:45.871 --> 16:48.072
But it'll be like
we're in their living room.

16:48.074 --> 16:50.407
- It's the perfect compromise.

16:50.409 --> 16:51.375
- Let me be in it.

16:51.377 --> 16:52.576
- Say what?
- Say what?

16:52.578 --> 16:53.877
- Let me be in your commercial!
Come on!

16:53.879 --> 16:58.082
No one believes
in mrs. Porkybunny's
more than I do.

16:58.084 --> 17:00.651
- You just said it was
the worst thing you ever heard.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.753
- I was acting!
You believed that?

17:02.755 --> 17:05.888
That proves what
a good actor I am.

17:05.891 --> 17:07.458
- Ehh.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.126
- Please! I'm begging you.

17:09.227 --> 17:11.729
Commercials
are impossible to get.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.464
You guys are my friends!

17:13.465 --> 17:17.901
Isn't that what
this is all about?

17:21.705 --> 17:23.574
Hello!

17:23.576 --> 17:24.907
I'm mrs. Porkybunny.

17:24.910 --> 17:27.611
If there's one thing I love,

17:27.613 --> 17:33.250
Oh, I start out
with garden fresh,
homegrown carrots,

17:33.252 --> 17:34.551
The big kind.

17:34.553 --> 17:38.622
Then I add a pinch of sugar,
a hint of vanilla,

17:38.624 --> 17:40.924
And most importantly,

17:40.926 --> 17:43.594
A whole lot of love.

17:43.695 --> 17:47.197
Save room for mrs. Porkybunny.

17:47.199 --> 17:50.367
I did.

17:50.369 --> 17:53.137
Mmm!

17:53.139 --> 17:56.273
- That wasn't so bad. Right?

17:56.275 --> 17:58.142
Right?

17:58.144 --> 18:01.245
[porky groaning]

18:08.486 --> 18:11.421
[chickens clucking]

18:14.092 --> 18:15.759
[squawking]

18:15.761 --> 18:19.429
- ¶ you see me standing here
in front of you ¶

18:19.664 --> 18:23.901
¶ like a dumb reprobate

¶ win or lose,

18:50.495 --> 18:52.696

19:07.613 --> 19:11.081
¶ 'cause I go full throttle
and I don't think twice ¶

19:11.083 --> 19:13.283
¶ I do my skating

¶ I'd like to say
I stick to my guns ¶

19:15.788 --> 19:20.224

¶ I used to keep my money

at making bad decisions ¶

20:13.212 --> 20:17.414
¶ bad decisions

20:23.788 --> 20:27.124
- I have good news
and I have bad news.

20:27.126 --> 20:28.225
- What's the good news?

20:28.227 --> 20:32.562
- I love, I say,
I love your commercial.

20:32.664 --> 20:33.730
- What?
- You did?

20:33.732 --> 20:35.465
- Casting daffy
as mrs. Porkybunny

20:35.467 --> 20:38.702
Was a stroke, I say,
a stroke of genius!

20:38.704 --> 20:42.139
I found the character
likeable, heartwarming,

20:42.141 --> 20:43.573
And utterly endearing.

20:43.575 --> 20:46.944
- Well, that's great.
But what's the bad news?

20:46.946 --> 20:50.314
- America found
mrs. Porkybunny unlikable,

20:50.316 --> 20:52.482
Untrustworthy, and very,

20:52.484 --> 20:54.618
I say very, disturbing.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.753
- So what does that mean
for the company?

20:56.755 --> 20:58.922
- I'm afraid, I say I'm afraid,

20:58.924 --> 21:02.759
Mrs. Porkybunny's
baked her last cake.

21:02.761 --> 21:05.095
You're bankrupt, boys.

21:05.196 --> 21:06.730
- [sighs]

21:06.732 --> 21:08.865
I thought
we were going to be rich.

21:08.867 --> 21:10.767
- But you are!
- Huh?

21:10.769 --> 21:12.970
- You put daffy
in that commercial

21:12.972 --> 21:14.438
Because he was your friend.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.807
And while money
might make you wealthy,

21:16.809 --> 21:19.109
It's friendship
that makes you rich.

21:19.111 --> 21:23.747
- So what you're saying is,
we're still rich.

21:23.749 --> 21:25.882
We're still rich.

21:25.884 --> 21:27.484
We're still rich.

21:27.486 --> 21:30.754
We're still rich.
We're still rich!

21:30.756 --> 21:32.956
- In friendship.
- We're still rich!

21:32.958 --> 21:35.959
- But not in money.
- We're still rich!

21:35.961 --> 21:38.628
- I'm just going to...
- We're still rich.

21:38.696 --> 21:39.563
- Metaphorically.

21:39.565 --> 21:42.265
- We're still rich.
We're still rich!

21:42.267 --> 21:43.266
- Not economically.

21:43.268 --> 21:47.871
- We're still rich!
We're still rich!

22:19.138 --> 22:20.804
That's all, folks!

22:20.806 --> 22:22.939
No, wait, that sounded weird.

22:22.941 --> 22:25.409
That's! All, folks.

22:25.411 --> 22:27.210
Yeah, that sounded better.

22:27.212 --> 22:29.279
That was a keeper.
