WEBVTT

00:00.165 --> 00:01.877
[Mac] Previously on
Commander In Chief:

00:01.944 --> 00:03.746
You expect me to go to the Senate

00:03.812 --> 00:05.781
and vote against my commander in chief?

00:05.848 --> 00:08.317
If you recall, we made a deal.

00:08.384 --> 00:09.785
Ma'am, my wife has been ill.

00:09.852 --> 00:14.089
I respectively request that you accept
my immediate resignation.

00:14.156 --> 00:17.226
You will be a tremendous loss
to this administration.

00:17.293 --> 00:19.295
From now on, we don't stop.

00:19.361 --> 00:21.630
Attack, attack, attack, attack.

00:21.697 --> 00:24.266
Care to comment
on this morning's USA TODAY poll?

00:24.333 --> 00:27.570
New numbers show you and the speaker
now tied among likely voters.

00:27.636 --> 00:30.039
Mr. Speaker, you running for something?

00:30.973 --> 00:32.808
[Kate] Mackenzie.

00:32.875 --> 00:34.710
[knocking on door]

00:34.777 --> 00:37.813
Are you awake in there?

00:37.880 --> 00:39.548
Yeah. Come on in.

00:39.615 --> 00:40.983
[door opens]

00:42.384 --> 00:45.154
Rod said you were
sleeping in this morning,

00:45.221 --> 00:48.057
which you haven't done
since you were a teenager.

00:48.123 --> 00:52.928
Which can only mean
you're either sick, tired or blue.

00:52.995 --> 00:54.496
You are clammy.

00:54.563 --> 00:55.931
I'm fine.

00:55.998 --> 00:58.167
Is it because of that Keaton fella?

00:58.234 --> 01:01.136
Warren, and, yeah, I'm...

01:01.203 --> 01:04.506
[groans] ...I'm a little, uh,
depressed about him, but...

01:05.407 --> 01:08.010
...then again, I'm sleep deprived.

01:08.077 --> 01:10.312
You should be, working 20 hours a day.

01:10.379 --> 01:14.149
Have you given any thought to
who's gonna be your next VP?

01:14.216 --> 01:17.353
I was one for a year and a half.

01:17.419 --> 01:20.422
Trust me, there's no rush.

01:21.590 --> 01:24.293
Mm. [groans]

01:25.194 --> 01:28.497
- Mac, are you all right?
- [door slams]

01:29.098 --> 01:32.201
Uh... You... You aren't...

01:33.402 --> 01:35.671
- You aren't by any chance...
- [door opens]

01:35.738 --> 01:39.074
- [toilet flushes]
- Mom, it's just a bug.

01:40.743 --> 01:43.979
Maybe you should stay home
and just take it easy today.

01:44.046 --> 01:46.448
I'm convening the WTO In Seattle

01:46.515 --> 01:48.083
in five hours.

01:48.150 --> 01:50.352
I'm meeting with
the Conference of Mayors

01:50.419 --> 01:52.121
in San Francisco in ten.

01:52.187 --> 01:55.190
I'm meeting with the union reps
for the airlines in 12

01:55.257 --> 01:56.925
in Los Angeles.

01:57.893 --> 02:00.896
Oh, and the twins are touring USC.

02:00.963 --> 02:02.031
[Kate] Oh.

02:02.097 --> 02:03.532
Is that all?

02:03.599 --> 02:05.668
The White House
continues to be besieged

02:05.734 --> 02:07.936
with questions regarding the resignation

02:08.002 --> 02:09.905
of Vice President Warren Keaton.

02:09.972 --> 02:13.075
Circumstances surrounding
the general's stepping down...

02:13.142 --> 02:14.143
[mutes TV]

02:14.910 --> 02:18.714
The greatest kindness
will not bind the ungrateful

02:18.781 --> 02:22.051
I love the sound
of Aesop's Fables in the morning.

02:22.117 --> 02:23.485
[both laugh]

02:24.420 --> 02:26.855
It's apt that, the farmer and the snake.

02:26.922 --> 02:29.491
I have a pretty good idea
who the snake is.

02:29.558 --> 02:31.560
The farmer revived the snake...

02:31.627 --> 02:34.630
By giving him a national stage
for the past year.

02:34.697 --> 02:36.699
Somebody said his wife was ill.

02:36.765 --> 02:39.601
Promise me that when
you pick your running mate...

02:39.668 --> 02:42.104
We mustn't get ahead
of ourselves, darling.

02:42.171 --> 02:45.441
...ah, that he or she will be loyal.

02:46.141 --> 02:47.743
Hang on a second.

02:47.810 --> 02:50.179
[man on TV]
Negotiations once again collapsed

02:50.245 --> 02:52.915
in the now week-long
airline pilots' strike,

02:52.981 --> 02:56.885
which threatens to cripple the industry
should sister unions take part.

02:56.952 --> 02:59.855
Representatives of the mechanics
and food service unions

02:59.922 --> 03:02.925
are reportedly sympathetic
to the demands of the pilots...

03:02.991 --> 03:05.027
She should intervene in this.

03:05.094 --> 03:07.930
Get a mandatory arbitration order,

03:07.996 --> 03:10.699
then work out a deal
with the airlines and the unions.

03:10.766 --> 03:13.268
This is just too much
punishment for the nation.

03:15.471 --> 03:18.807
When are you declaring, anyway?
I mean, Iowa's not that far off.

03:18.874 --> 03:20.542
A decline in ticket sales...

03:20.609 --> 03:23.479
Oh, it's early days yet.

03:25.948 --> 03:28.650
[Jim] Where are we in terms
of replacing Warren Keaton?

03:28.717 --> 03:32.121
The question is, if a vice president
falls over in the forest,

03:32.187 --> 03:35.124
- does he make a noise?
- With 55 electoral votes, he could.

03:35.190 --> 03:38.260
The governor of California
isn't interested in the position.

03:38.327 --> 03:41.130
Florida's out. Still bad blood
there from the oil spill.

03:41.196 --> 03:43.565
- Arizona?
- Not in this lifetime.

03:43.632 --> 03:47.970
Governor of New York...
centrist Republican, pro-choice, tall.

03:48.036 --> 03:50.539
A week from being indicted
on corruption charges.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.474
What about another Independent?

03:54.309 --> 03:56.745
A deafening silence falls over the room.

03:56.812 --> 04:01.116
- Anyone else feel like this is dÃ©jÃ  vu?
- The least important job in Washington.

04:01.183 --> 04:05.454
Which is a heartbeat away from
the presidency, as recent history shows.

04:06.422 --> 04:09.191
[Vince] Your mom's office
and cabin are to the left.

04:09.258 --> 04:12.094
- The conference room is on the right.
- What's down here?

04:12.161 --> 04:14.196
- Uh, the galley and so forth.
- Snack bar?

04:14.263 --> 04:16.098
Kind of, but you might want to stay...

04:16.165 --> 04:17.933
- Check it out. Plasma TV.
- Nice.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.435
- And here's the galley.
- And this? What's this?

04:20.502 --> 04:24.039
Uh, the press room. You don't really
need... Please, this way, OK?

04:24.106 --> 04:26.308
- Oh, hey! Hey, Horace.
- Hi, guys.

04:26.375 --> 04:28.177
Hey. So, are you dating anyone?

04:28.243 --> 04:30.879
- Uh, no, not really.
- We don't bite.

04:30.946 --> 04:34.082
Rebecca, do you have a message
for the children of the country?

04:34.149 --> 04:35.717
Um, no, but...

04:35.784 --> 04:38.854
Please back off. They're kids, OK?
Thank you. Come on.

04:38.921 --> 04:41.156
- [all shouting at once]
- Vince!

04:41.223 --> 04:42.658
Come on.

04:42.724 --> 04:44.693
After meeting with the director,

04:44.760 --> 04:47.262
let's squeeze in ten minutes
with the Japanese rep

04:47.329 --> 04:49.364
regarding the ministerial conference.

04:49.431 --> 04:50.933
I'll see if I can arrange it.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.568
How about you just arrange it?

04:52.634 --> 04:56.171
[Jim] Go easy on him, ma'am. It's
the deputy's first Air Force One trip.

04:56.238 --> 04:58.307
Uh, where are we
with the airline strike?

04:58.373 --> 05:00.542
Mechanics union
could join the picket line.

05:00.609 --> 05:02.511
All but shutting down the majors.

05:02.578 --> 05:04.580
Could somebody please put up the air?

05:04.646 --> 05:06.482
That's the second time I've asked.

05:06.548 --> 05:08.851
The travel industry's close
to a standstill

05:08.917 --> 05:10.819
with the holiday weekend coming up.

05:10.886 --> 05:13.522
You could force the unions
back to work for 60 days.

05:13.589 --> 05:17.292
No, no. To have the government force
the issue now would derail everything

05:17.359 --> 05:21.330
that the, uh, mediation team
has been working for for six months.

05:21.396 --> 05:23.599
Guys, we are close.

05:24.566 --> 05:26.101
Mm.

05:28.270 --> 05:29.671
Ma'am, are you all right?

05:31.273 --> 05:32.574
Did I miss something?

05:32.641 --> 05:36.278
Look, I know that this has been
difficult for everyone involved,

05:36.345 --> 05:39.448
for the unions, for management,
for the American people,

05:39.515 --> 05:41.416
but if we could get through this,

05:41.483 --> 05:44.853
the industry will be
strike-free for five years.

05:44.920 --> 05:49.124
Yes, but that deal's gonna require
tremendous compromise from all sides.

05:49.191 --> 05:50.759
Uh, ma'am?

05:52.828 --> 05:54.763
- Uh, ma'am?
- Hmm?

05:54.830 --> 05:57.699
- Maybe you should lie down?
- I'm OK. I'm feeling better.

05:57.766 --> 05:59.535
Jim, where was I?

05:59.601 --> 06:03.105
Jim, uh, Jim...

06:03.805 --> 06:08.176
I wanna meet with...
with the union reps in person.

06:08.243 --> 06:12.247
[groans]

06:12.314 --> 06:13.982
Um, get the doctor in here.

06:14.049 --> 06:15.551
And call Mr. Calloway.

06:17.252 --> 06:20.088
- What's going on?
- [Kelly] The president's sick. Ma'am?

06:20.155 --> 06:22.057
- [groaning]
- Ma'am?

06:36.071 --> 06:37.973
The White House doc's looking at her.

06:38.040 --> 06:41.043
I need a list of secure hospitals
in the event we have to land.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.744
Just push the meetings.

06:42.811 --> 06:45.080
I don't know. She looks pretty pale.

06:45.147 --> 06:47.983
- I don't understand. What happened?
- We're not sure yet.

06:48.050 --> 06:49.451
She's gonna be OK, right?

06:49.518 --> 06:51.620
- [groans]
- Mom?

06:51.687 --> 06:54.623
- What's goin' on?
- Acute appendicitis. Possible rupture.

06:54.690 --> 06:55.991
Are you sure?

06:56.058 --> 06:58.060
She has all the symptoms and signs.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.762
How long are we talking about
being out of commission?

07:00.829 --> 07:04.499
Depends on what we find. Anywhere
from one to four hours, plus recovery.

07:04.566 --> 07:06.835
- I'm gonna tell the pilot to turn back.
- To DC?

07:06.902 --> 07:09.204
No, we need to get her
to a hospital right now.

07:09.271 --> 07:10.706
Wait, I have to talk to Jim.

07:10.772 --> 07:11.807
Hold on. Wait...

07:11.873 --> 07:13.875
No. We'll invoke the 25th Amendment.

07:13.942 --> 07:17.012
- Vince, get him back on the phone.
- Yes, ma'am. Guys.

07:17.079 --> 07:21.216
I need to be functional for as long
as possible. What can you give me?

07:21.283 --> 07:24.553
Let's get you on antibiotics,
Then we'll worry about pain relief.

07:24.620 --> 07:27.522
I've postponed Seattle,
San Francisco and LA. Where are we?

07:27.589 --> 07:31.026
- Landing soon, hopefully.
- Ma'am, Mr. Gardner's on line one.

07:32.361 --> 07:34.029
Mr. Gardner, you're on speaker.

07:34.096 --> 07:35.664
Ma'am, are you all right?

07:35.731 --> 07:38.367
Uh, uh, not exactly.

07:38.433 --> 07:41.837
[groans] It looks like
I need surgery on my appendix.

07:41.903 --> 07:44.139
Where are you having this done?

07:44.206 --> 07:46.541
We're looking into Tinker AFB.

07:46.608 --> 07:49.411
That's Oklahoma.
I thought we were over Nebraska.

07:49.478 --> 07:52.314
We are, but a military hospital
provides more security.

07:52.381 --> 07:53.982
I need her in a hospital now.

07:54.049 --> 07:56.752
[Dickie] We have to keep
the press out of this.

07:56.818 --> 07:59.655
[man] We're doing everything
we can to secure a location.

07:59.721 --> 08:02.991
There's McConnell Air Force Base
in Kansas, Whiteman in Missouri.

08:03.058 --> 08:06.828
Find the closest secure hospital,
and land this plane now.

08:06.895 --> 08:09.197
[Dickie] She cannot
be seen on a gurney.

08:09.264 --> 08:11.733
She is a woman.
People think she has less stamina.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.769
- Jeez.
- [Mac] No, no, he's right.

08:13.835 --> 08:17.339
At least as far as panicking
the public is concerned.

08:17.406 --> 08:20.776
Less than a year ago,
a sitting president died.

08:20.842 --> 08:23.745
We have to make sure the press
keeps this in perspective.

08:23.812 --> 08:28.016
J... Jim, can you speak to
the Senate pro tem about, uh,

08:28.083 --> 08:30.719
- taking over?
- Of course.

08:30.786 --> 08:33.989
Constitutionally,
isn't Templeton next in line?

08:34.056 --> 08:36.625
He'd have to resign his seat
in Congress to accept.

08:36.692 --> 08:38.693
I'll notify him just as a formality.

08:38.760 --> 08:39.760
Do that.

08:39.828 --> 08:42.197
The question is,
can he keep it in perspective?

08:42.264 --> 08:44.700
Well, the only plane
that is flying these days

08:44.766 --> 08:46.668
is Air Force One.

08:46.735 --> 08:49.938
Mr. Speaker, what impact do you see
this having on the economy?

08:50.005 --> 08:51.740
Crippling, all across the board.

08:51.807 --> 08:54.242
Look at Wall Street,
look at the American people.

08:54.309 --> 08:57.112
They're facing a disastrous
Memorial Day weekend

08:57.179 --> 08:59.548
because this president
is more interested

08:59.614 --> 09:04.086
in addressing the demands of the unions
than the needs of the people.

09:04.152 --> 09:06.722
Can you speak to rumors
that you intend to make a run

09:06.788 --> 09:08.790
for the White House?

09:08.857 --> 09:11.159
My aspiration, my only aspiration,

09:11.226 --> 09:14.963
is that this country have
what's best for this country.

09:15.030 --> 09:19.668
That said, if this
downward spiral continues,

09:19.735 --> 09:21.803
somebody's gonna have to step up.

09:21.870 --> 09:23.438
So you are considering a bid?

09:23.505 --> 09:25.507
Sorry, that was the last question.

09:25.574 --> 09:27.943
- The speaker has an engagement.
- Sorry, guys.

09:28.009 --> 09:31.012
She's the boss. Thank you.

09:31.079 --> 09:34.616
I hope "engagement" is a euphemism
for lunch 'cause I'm starving.

09:34.683 --> 09:37.519
That was Jim Gardner.
The president's appendix burst.

09:37.586 --> 09:40.222
Good God, burst? Is she OK?

09:40.288 --> 09:41.490
She needs surgery.

09:41.556 --> 09:44.493
They need you to sign a waiver
to swear in the Senate pro temps.

09:44.559 --> 09:47.162
When should I tell him we'll be there?

09:47.229 --> 09:49.431
Just give me a second, OK?

09:49.498 --> 09:52.134
I... I need to speak to Gavin Kester.

09:53.268 --> 09:56.438
Is it me, or are we descending?

09:59.174 --> 10:00.342
What the hell?

10:00.742 --> 10:03.645
- Kelly, what's going on?
- We just need to make a quick stop.

10:03.712 --> 10:06.548
- Is something wrong with the plane?
- Details to follow.

10:06.615 --> 10:08.984
- Can you tell us where we're landing?
- Not yet.

10:10.285 --> 10:12.320
[telephone ringing]

10:12.387 --> 10:16.158
Oh! Oh, you terrible person, you.

10:16.224 --> 10:17.392
I got your queen.

10:17.459 --> 10:20.629
I know. Hello.

10:20.695 --> 10:22.764
- Uh, Kate, it's me.
- Rod?

10:22.831 --> 10:25.967
Yeah, don't be concerned,
but Mac needs surgery.

10:26.034 --> 10:27.035
It's her appendix.

10:27.102 --> 10:29.538
We'll get on a plane right away.
Where should we go?

10:29.604 --> 10:30.672
Go where?

10:30.739 --> 10:32.507
No, no, don't... don't do that.

10:32.574 --> 10:35.477
Just stay there and take care of Amy.

10:35.544 --> 10:38.680
With any luck, we'll be back
the same day we were scheduled to be.

10:38.747 --> 10:41.616
- Are you sure? Because if not...
- No, I'm sure. I'm sure.

10:41.683 --> 10:45.754
And tell Amy that everything's
gonna be just fine, OK?

10:45.821 --> 10:47.889
You'll call as soon
as you hear anything?

10:47.956 --> 10:49.591
- Can I talk to Daddy?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:49.658 --> 10:51.359
- Not right now, dear.
- I gotta go.

10:51.426 --> 10:53.228
Listen, send her our love, will you?

10:53.295 --> 10:55.497
Oh, of course.

10:55.564 --> 10:57.532
She's invoking the 25th Amendment

10:57.599 --> 11:01.970
as well as the Presidential
Succession Act of 1947.

11:02.037 --> 11:05.040
That means I'd have to
resign my seat in the House.

11:05.106 --> 11:06.741
[Gavin] That's correct.

11:06.808 --> 11:08.810
That means
I give up voting privileges.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.745
You'll still be Speaker of the House.

11:10.812 --> 11:14.783
- He maintains authority over Congress?
- Yes, he presides over joint sessions,

11:14.850 --> 11:18.920
determine committee appointments,
all wield significant influence.

11:18.987 --> 11:21.990
The governor of Florida would
have to hold a special election

11:22.057 --> 11:23.592
to fill my voting seat, right?

11:23.658 --> 11:25.861
The party carries the district.

11:25.927 --> 11:27.896
We'll still control that vote.

11:27.963 --> 11:30.932
[Gavin] You'd likely need
to resign to campaign full-time.

11:30.999 --> 11:35.604
Guys, I've been a voting member
of Congress for over 40 years.

11:36.504 --> 11:37.939
I voted...

11:38.006 --> 11:40.909
I voted against segregation
with the Civil Rights Act,

11:40.976 --> 11:45.146
voted for every tax cut, welfare reform,

11:46.214 --> 11:48.650
war... I've voted for three wars.

11:50.151 --> 11:52.654
But I would be president.

11:52.721 --> 11:55.056
For a day, but...

11:55.123 --> 11:57.325
...I would be president.

11:57.392 --> 12:00.795
[sirens wailing]

12:22.417 --> 12:24.419
I thought no one
was supposed to know yet.

12:24.486 --> 12:25.987
They weren't.

12:26.054 --> 12:29.224
Apparently word's out. We're keeping
them as far back as we can.

12:29.291 --> 12:30.592
- Kelly.
- I'm on it.

12:30.659 --> 12:33.728
[reporters shouting indistinctly]

12:41.002 --> 12:42.370
Kelly!

12:42.437 --> 12:44.673
Kelly, what's wrong
with the president?

12:44.739 --> 12:47.242
President Allen is suffering
from appendicitis,

12:47.309 --> 12:50.011
which involves a relatively minor
surgical procedure

12:50.078 --> 12:51.613
followed by a short recovery.

12:51.680 --> 12:54.049
The president is otherwise
in excellent health.

12:54.115 --> 12:56.117
A full, immediate recovery is expected.

12:56.184 --> 12:59.487
Will local doctors be used, or will
specialists be flown in from DC?

12:59.554 --> 13:01.156
I don't have that information.

13:01.222 --> 13:03.792
With no vice president in place,
who's in charge?

13:03.858 --> 13:06.428
The Constitution dictates
a line of succession

13:06.494 --> 13:08.863
but at this point,
it's simply ceremonial.

13:08.930 --> 13:11.533
How long, exactly,
is the recovery time?

13:11.599 --> 13:14.936
We're talking about
a common surgical procedure.

13:15.003 --> 13:18.506
The president isn't worried,
The country shouldn't be either.

13:18.573 --> 13:20.909
- How's she doing?
- The president will be fine.

13:20.976 --> 13:24.412
Lousy timing on Keaton's. Probably
hasn't had a thing to do in months.

13:24.479 --> 13:28.116
When she does need him, he's history.
Anyway, what do I sign?

13:28.183 --> 13:30.385
We're waiting
to hear back from the speaker.

13:30.452 --> 13:32.954
It's a formality,
but one that has to be observed.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.289
Should be any minute.

13:34.356 --> 13:37.425
We'll need to get you sworn in,
get you the nuclear football.

13:37.492 --> 13:39.194
Limo with Secret Service detail?

13:39.260 --> 13:40.729
Maybe even a free lunch.

13:40.795 --> 13:43.932
All this fuss over appendicitis.
I had mine yanked years ago.

13:43.999 --> 13:46.001
I was back on
the tennis court in a week.

13:46.067 --> 13:47.202
- Hi.
- Senator.

13:47.268 --> 13:48.370
Good to see you.

13:48.436 --> 13:49.771
- I'll be right in.
- Yeah.

13:50.905 --> 13:52.240
What's this all about?

13:53.274 --> 13:57.278
A letter from the speaker accepting
the position of acting president.

13:57.912 --> 13:58.913
What?

13:58.980 --> 14:00.882
Don't shoot the messenger.

14:00.949 --> 14:03.084
Why is he doing this?

14:03.151 --> 14:04.919
Because he can.

14:11.292 --> 14:14.095
Put up 3.375 grams of Zosyn.

14:15.363 --> 14:16.965
How are you guys doing?

14:17.032 --> 14:18.967
You're asking us?

14:20.268 --> 14:22.070
Rod, you talked to Amy?

14:22.137 --> 14:24.105
No, no, I talked to Kate.

14:24.939 --> 14:27.075
And how's the country?

14:27.142 --> 14:29.744
Stop worrying. It's fine.

14:30.545 --> 14:34.115
I'll scrub in, but Dr. Wade Rucker
will be performing the surgery.

14:34.182 --> 14:35.984
Not you?

14:36.051 --> 14:38.753
I'm an internist.
Rucker's been vetted by the service.

14:38.820 --> 14:40.989
He's the best general surgeon
here in Omaha.

14:41.056 --> 14:42.924
OK.

14:45.527 --> 14:48.863
Excuse me, ma'am.
I just spoke to Jim, and...

14:48.930 --> 14:52.067
...Templeton's accepted
the position of acting president.

14:58.373 --> 15:01.142
President's on line one,
and they're here.

15:01.209 --> 15:02.944
Keep them in there.

15:05.013 --> 15:06.481
Madam President.

15:06.548 --> 15:09.217
I'm not sure why you're
doing this, Nathan, but...

15:09.284 --> 15:11.186
Who do you want minding the store,

15:11.252 --> 15:13.154
me or the Senate pro temps?

15:13.221 --> 15:15.323
I mean, he's an idiot.
We both know that.

15:16.157 --> 15:19.027
Well... just remember,

15:19.094 --> 15:21.596
anything you do could be easily undone

15:21.663 --> 15:24.232
when I resume office.

15:24.299 --> 15:25.300
[groans]

15:25.366 --> 15:27.402
Don't you trouble your head about this.

15:27.469 --> 15:30.138
You concentrate on getting
yourself better, OK?

15:30.205 --> 15:31.873
[groans]

15:33.541 --> 15:35.543
Just watch yourself, Mr. Speaker.

15:37.112 --> 15:39.514
It's always nice talkin' to you, Rod.

15:39.581 --> 15:41.416
You take care of her, all right?

15:41.483 --> 15:43.485
See you soon.

15:44.319 --> 15:46.588
- [Jim] Nathan.
- Hi, Jim.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.089
Justice Talbot.

15:48.156 --> 15:49.691
Mr. Speaker.

15:50.558 --> 15:53.495
- Shall we do this?
- Uh, give me one second, guys.

15:53.561 --> 15:56.831
Photographers. Hi. Come right on in.

15:56.898 --> 15:59.667
Make sure you get the flag
in the picture, OK?

16:01.169 --> 16:02.270
OK?

16:02.337 --> 16:05.106
Raise your right hand. Repeat after me.

16:05.173 --> 16:09.344
I, Nathan Everett Templeton,
do solemnly swear...

16:09.410 --> 16:10.678
I,

16:10.745 --> 16:14.849
Nathan Everett Templeton,
do solemnly swear...

16:14.916 --> 16:18.987
...that I will faithfully
execute the Office

16:19.053 --> 16:21.356
of President of the United States...

16:21.422 --> 16:23.691
...that I will faithfully
execute the Office

16:23.758 --> 16:25.927
of President of the United States...

16:25.994 --> 16:28.096
...and will,
to the best of my ability...

16:28.163 --> 16:30.198
...and will,
to the best of my ability...

16:30.265 --> 16:32.200
...preserve, protect and defend

16:32.267 --> 16:34.235
the Constitution of the United States.

16:34.302 --> 16:36.905
...preserve, protect and defend

16:36.971 --> 16:40.508
the Constitution of the United States,

16:40.575 --> 16:42.343
so help me God.

16:47.448 --> 16:49.350
This is your Secret Service detail.

16:49.417 --> 16:52.387
The colonel will familiarize you
with the nuclear football.

16:52.453 --> 16:54.622
I will be in the West Wing
should you need me.

16:54.689 --> 16:56.691
Thank you, Jim. Thank you, Justice.

17:00.995 --> 17:03.731
Hello, Mr. President.

17:04.965 --> 17:07.868
Come, colonel. Sit down over here.
Sit right down there.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.574
I feel so hazy.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.410
We gave you a mild pre-op sedative.

17:15.476 --> 17:16.810
We have... we have to...

17:16.877 --> 17:18.546
Listen, you just try to relax.

17:18.613 --> 17:20.615
Stop worrying. It'll be fine.

17:22.217 --> 17:23.785
Oh.

17:23.851 --> 17:25.252
- Hey.
- Hmm?

17:25.319 --> 17:27.321
See you in a few hours.

17:36.130 --> 17:38.700
[woman] While there is concern
that President Allen

17:38.766 --> 17:41.069
will be out of commission
for a number of hours,

17:41.135 --> 17:43.404
White House officials
have issued a statement

17:43.471 --> 17:47.175
assuring the country that the surgery
the president is expected to undergo

17:47.242 --> 17:49.377
is quite commonplace.

17:49.444 --> 17:52.247
We're being told that
acting president Nathan Templeton

17:52.313 --> 17:55.350
has arrived at the White House,
where we'll now go live.

17:55.416 --> 17:58.620
- [reporters all shouting at once]
- I have to make this quick, guys.

17:58.686 --> 18:01.923
Look who's in the henhouse.

18:01.990 --> 18:05.026
- Are you working out of the Oval?
- Oh, let me be clear.

18:05.093 --> 18:07.629
Uh, I'm here on the president's behalf

18:07.695 --> 18:11.332
to fulfill the obligations
of some long-scheduled appointments.

18:11.399 --> 18:12.634
[man] Mr. President.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.469
- Bobby.
- Mr. President,

18:14.535 --> 18:17.138
what's the first thing you plan
on doing in the Oval?

18:18.306 --> 18:19.540
Me?

18:21.042 --> 18:22.610
I'm gonna sit down.

18:22.677 --> 18:24.045
[laughter]

18:24.112 --> 18:26.281
You know, the truth be told,

18:26.347 --> 18:28.683
every second of every day,

18:28.750 --> 18:31.185
there's work to be done in there,

18:31.252 --> 18:32.854
and I intend to do it.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.589
Thank you. Thank you.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.224
[reporters shouting]

18:36.291 --> 18:39.494
Ordinarily, I wouldn't be
interested in your tactics.

18:39.560 --> 18:40.895
But?

18:40.962 --> 18:42.830
Keep the press off him.

18:42.897 --> 18:45.466
[man] OK, the abdomen's insufflated.

18:45.533 --> 18:48.336
I'm gonna put the scope in.
Let's see what we're facing.

18:48.403 --> 18:50.838
Blood pressure's fine. She's set at 98%.

18:50.905 --> 18:54.175
Let me have a 15 blade
and have the 10-millimeter trocar ready.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.011
15.

19:02.083 --> 19:03.584
Doctor?

19:07.255 --> 19:08.823
Everything OK, Dr. Rucker?

19:08.890 --> 19:10.258
Yeah, sorry.

19:10.325 --> 19:13.928
I just, uh, never thought at breakfast
I'd be doing this today, you know?

19:13.995 --> 19:18.166
Everyone, right now, she's just
a nice lady with a sick appendix.

19:21.936 --> 19:23.538
Yeah.

19:23.604 --> 19:25.273
OK, here we go.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.070
Was this really necessary?

19:56.137 --> 20:00.108
For Sgt. Michael Denton, it was.

20:00.174 --> 20:02.477
Bronze Star designee.

20:02.543 --> 20:05.179
Pulled four soldiers from
the wreckage of a Black Hawk

20:05.246 --> 20:07.648
before losing his leg
to a fuel tank explosion.

20:07.715 --> 20:09.984
It was on the books
for the vice president.

20:10.051 --> 20:13.821
Nobody notified Denton. He flew
himself out here for the ceremony.

20:13.888 --> 20:16.090
This couldn't have
happened on the Hill?

20:16.157 --> 20:20.128
A hero deserves better than postponement
or a trip to the speaker's office.

20:20.194 --> 20:22.930
He deserved
White House treatment, Jim...

20:22.997 --> 20:25.466
...Oval Office treatment
for what he's done.

20:25.533 --> 20:28.803
That, and the speaker thought
it'd be best to be briefed in person.

20:31.873 --> 20:34.509
I'll gather senior staff,
but so you know,

20:34.575 --> 20:36.577
we don't anticipate any problems.

20:36.644 --> 20:39.480
It is, after all,
only a matter of hours.

20:39.547 --> 20:41.449
Relax, Jim.

20:43.284 --> 20:44.819
Calm down.

20:45.620 --> 20:48.289
Barring the unforeseen,

20:48.356 --> 20:52.727
my stay here will be
completely uneventful.

20:52.794 --> 20:53.828
OK?

20:54.829 --> 20:56.364
Thank you.

21:04.539 --> 21:07.308
You cannot imagine

21:07.375 --> 21:09.444
what it is like to be president.

21:10.344 --> 21:13.514
It has to actually happen to you.

21:14.482 --> 21:15.716
It's unbelievable.

21:15.783 --> 21:17.652
He's speaking to the press?

21:17.718 --> 21:20.354
Yep. Making a meal
out of an hors d'oeuvre.

21:20.421 --> 21:22.089
Gotta put a lock on the fridge.

21:22.156 --> 21:23.758
All right, who's on our team?

21:23.825 --> 21:24.992
From the press corps?

21:25.059 --> 21:27.128
Uh, Liz at the Examiner,

21:27.195 --> 21:29.363
Orlando at the Times, everyone at AP.

21:29.430 --> 21:31.532
E-mail me the list,
divide and conquer.

21:31.599 --> 21:34.135
You take "A" through "M",
I'll take "N" through "Z".

21:34.202 --> 21:35.736
Fine.

21:35.803 --> 21:37.338
Shouldn't they be done by now?

21:37.405 --> 21:41.742
Yeah, they said it was gonna be
between, uh, three and four hours and...

21:41.809 --> 21:44.545
...we're just at three right now.

21:44.612 --> 21:47.648
Pistons lead by seven.

21:47.715 --> 21:51.219
[woman] ...for the second time,
the White House faces a health scare.

21:51.285 --> 21:53.521
Is there a curse on the presidency?

21:53.588 --> 21:55.156
And the airline strike...

21:55.223 --> 21:56.824
Why would they say that?

21:56.891 --> 21:59.827
'Cause they're stupid.
Where's the remote?

21:59.894 --> 22:02.063
...your thoughts
on the impending lockout.

22:02.129 --> 22:06.200
[woman] You know, it's crazy.
They just keep canceling the flights.

22:06.267 --> 22:08.069
Now, I know the president's sick,

22:08.135 --> 22:10.671
but what was she doing before this?

22:10.738 --> 22:12.440
[man] It's killing the economy.

22:12.507 --> 22:14.742
[woman 2] Don't blame me.
I didn't vote for her.

22:20.681 --> 22:22.517
On behalf of a grateful nation,

22:22.583 --> 22:28.189
I present this Bronze Star
to you, Sgt. Michael Denton,

22:28.256 --> 22:30.925
for your bravery and your sacrifice

22:30.992 --> 22:34.428
and for the inspiration
your heroic actions

22:34.495 --> 22:36.898
have given to us, the people.

22:38.032 --> 22:39.133
Congratulations.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.202
Thank you.
It's an honor and a privilege.

22:41.269 --> 22:44.038
Oh, for me, too, sergeant.

22:44.906 --> 22:46.607
I want to tell you, Mrs. Denton,

22:46.674 --> 22:49.911
that your husband makes me proud
to be an American.

22:51.245 --> 22:52.713
Thank you, guys.

22:52.780 --> 22:55.416
I thought we put a lid on
the photo-ops with the press.

22:55.483 --> 22:57.418
We did. He brought in his own people.

22:58.152 --> 23:00.388
Thank you. Congratulations.

23:02.823 --> 23:05.426
I hope you enjoy
the rest of your time in Washington.

23:05.493 --> 23:08.996
You kiddin'? It's all gravy from here.
You said The Capital Grille?

23:09.063 --> 23:11.966
You just tell 'em I sent you.
They'll take good care of you.

23:12.033 --> 23:14.001
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

23:14.068 --> 23:16.003
Thank you.

23:16.070 --> 23:19.040
The staff's assembled
in the Cabinet Room as you requested.

23:19.106 --> 23:20.708
Good. I'm on my way.

23:20.775 --> 23:22.243
How's Mackenzie? Any word.

23:22.310 --> 23:25.346
Surgery's just taking longer
than originally thought.

23:25.413 --> 23:27.682
But she's OK, yeah?

23:27.748 --> 23:29.650
Good.

23:29.717 --> 23:33.254
I'm going to have to do
a bit of multitasking, Jim.

23:33.321 --> 23:35.356
I'm bringing over the House leadership.

23:35.423 --> 23:38.526
You get together with Jayne.
She has all the particulars, OK?

23:39.660 --> 23:41.495
Thank you.

23:47.234 --> 23:49.937
[woman] BP is labile. Systolic is 92.

23:50.004 --> 23:52.473
[Rucker] Give me
a better view cephalad.

23:52.540 --> 23:54.408
I need to see along the psoas.

23:54.475 --> 23:56.010
Tilt the camera. Suction here.

23:59.780 --> 24:01.048
It's a pretty bad perf.

24:01.115 --> 24:03.117
- [machine beeps]
- She's hypotensive.

24:03.184 --> 24:06.153
I've given her a bolus,
and I'm giving her one of epi.

24:06.921 --> 24:08.889
Damn it.

24:08.956 --> 24:10.558
I need to open. Pull the trocars.

24:10.625 --> 24:14.061
- You're switching to an open technique?
- I don't have a choice.

24:14.128 --> 24:16.564
I need better access. 10 blade.

24:24.405 --> 24:27.775
- [woman] Blood pressure's dropping.
- What's her heart rate?

24:27.842 --> 24:30.578
- 110.
- It's ugly all the way to the pelvis.

24:30.645 --> 24:32.847
I'm giving her another bolus.

24:32.913 --> 24:35.149
I'm struggling here.
Just let me know, OK?

24:35.216 --> 24:37.985
I just need to clean it up.
Clean it all out, you know?

24:38.052 --> 24:40.154
- We should be fine.
- Run of ectopy.

24:40.221 --> 24:41.922
Yankauer. How many beats?

24:41.989 --> 24:44.925
- Three, four...
- Another two liters of NS irrigation.

24:44.992 --> 24:48.629
- The pericolic gutter is contaminated.
- Cardiac irritability!

24:48.696 --> 24:50.731
I know. Lido drip. Two migs per minute.

24:50.798 --> 24:53.367
- Damn it.
- [monitor beeping erratically]

24:55.436 --> 24:58.272
Need a redraft of the president's
Saturday radio address

24:58.339 --> 25:00.041
to account for the new situation.

25:00.107 --> 25:03.144
We put it to bed a week ago.
Are you suggesting that we amend it?

25:03.210 --> 25:06.981
I'm suggesting we need a copy
for our staff to rewrite it...

25:07.048 --> 25:10.718
...in the event that the acting
president needs to deliver it.

25:10.785 --> 25:12.820
Make it happen, OK?

25:12.887 --> 25:15.723
Hey, Jim. Hold up.

25:15.790 --> 25:19.660
- We haven't had a chance to talk.
- It's all happened pretty quickly.

25:19.727 --> 25:21.395
It's pretty amazing, isn't it?

25:21.462 --> 25:23.698
You and me, co-chiefs of staff.

25:23.764 --> 25:26.200
Amazing isn't the word I would use.

25:27.768 --> 25:31.005
This puts you in an awkward position,
but the fact of the matter...

25:31.072 --> 25:33.107
If your boss does anything
that in any way

25:33.174 --> 25:35.643
negatively impacts
the president or the country,

25:35.710 --> 25:38.713
we will hold his feet to the fire.
It'll all be on him.

25:38.779 --> 25:40.481
Understood?

25:44.719 --> 25:47.254
In the early going,
NMB and the ALPA

25:47.321 --> 25:49.623
made modest headway
on pension plans,

25:49.690 --> 25:52.660
but overtime and salary increases
remain problematic.

25:52.727 --> 25:55.496
The country is gridlocked, Jim.

25:55.563 --> 25:57.665
How big a strike fund
do the airlines have?

25:57.732 --> 25:59.166
Enough to last 300 days.

25:59.233 --> 26:01.135
Any talk of mandatory arbitration?

26:01.202 --> 26:03.838
The president prefers to keep
everyone at the table,

26:03.904 --> 26:06.107
hammer out a deal for the long term.

26:06.173 --> 26:10.377
Which, in the short term,
is damaging to the economy.

26:10.444 --> 26:11.479
What else?

26:11.545 --> 26:15.116
Stock market jitters, anxiety
over the president's illness.

26:15.182 --> 26:16.717
Where are we internationally?

26:16.784 --> 26:19.854
Election numbers are in from
Sierra Leone. SLPP held on.

26:19.920 --> 26:23.324
Rioting in Germany, which grew
out of anti-immigration protests.

26:23.390 --> 26:26.327
Mostly contained.
I just spoke with the chancellor.

26:27.862 --> 26:29.096
Did you now?

26:29.163 --> 26:32.166
[woman] President Templeton.
You're needed in the Sit Room.

26:32.233 --> 26:34.769
Thank you. Jayne.

26:34.835 --> 26:35.936
I'll go.

26:41.041 --> 26:43.811
[sighs] OK, then.
Where are we on vitals?

26:43.878 --> 26:45.379
Pressure's great.

26:45.446 --> 26:47.248
She's just on maintenance fluids.

26:47.314 --> 26:48.849
Stump looks good.

26:48.916 --> 26:51.452
Nice hemostasis.
Everything looks clean.

26:54.054 --> 26:56.857
[sighs] That was a bear,
but I think we got away with it.

26:56.924 --> 26:59.560
3.0 of vicryl. Let's get out of Dodge.

27:02.863 --> 27:04.965
- [man] Ten-hut!
- [man] Mr. President.

27:05.032 --> 27:08.235
Sit down, everybody. What's going on?

27:11.205 --> 27:12.339
What's going on?

27:12.406 --> 27:15.109
Shortly after 1700 hours our time,

27:15.176 --> 27:17.244
a suicide bomber detonated himself

27:17.311 --> 27:19.747
at a bus stop 10 miles
outside of Tel Aviv.

27:19.814 --> 27:21.615
Anyone claiming responsibility?

27:21.682 --> 27:24.251
The Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine.

27:24.318 --> 27:26.520
The Israelis
have threatened to retaliate.

27:26.587 --> 27:28.189
That's our understanding, sir.

27:28.255 --> 27:31.358
We should call the prime minister,
urge them to refrain...

27:31.425 --> 27:34.094
We should do nothing of the kind.

27:34.161 --> 27:36.931
Israel has a right to defend itself.

27:36.997 --> 27:38.899
End of story.

27:38.966 --> 27:40.034
That it?

27:41.202 --> 27:42.203
Thank you.

27:45.773 --> 27:47.775
[Kate] "So get on your way."

27:47.842 --> 27:49.176
The end.

27:50.444 --> 27:52.513
When could I talk to Mommy?

27:52.580 --> 27:54.215
I don't know, honey.

27:54.281 --> 27:56.250
Uh, soon, though.

27:56.317 --> 27:57.785
In the morning?

27:57.852 --> 27:59.086
Maybe.

28:00.387 --> 28:03.490
Oh! She's going to be all right.

28:03.557 --> 28:06.060
I promise you.

28:06.126 --> 28:08.128
- [kiss]
- Good night, baby.

28:12.466 --> 28:15.135
Grandma, wait. I need Pony.

28:16.437 --> 28:18.072
I left him in Mommy's office.

28:18.138 --> 28:19.773
Oh, honey.

28:19.840 --> 28:21.542
I have to go outside and all...

28:21.609 --> 28:23.711
I have bad dreams without him.

28:23.777 --> 28:25.746
Please.

28:27.615 --> 28:29.149
Oh.

28:30.017 --> 28:31.752
[groans]

28:31.819 --> 28:33.520
There you are.

28:35.823 --> 28:39.159
Oh, hi, Mrs. Allen. You startled me.

28:39.226 --> 28:41.328
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

28:41.395 --> 28:44.832
I... I was looking for Pony,
if you must know.

28:44.899 --> 28:46.667
No, I don't need to know.

28:46.734 --> 28:48.903
With me, you are always welcome.

28:51.605 --> 28:52.806
Should you be here?

28:52.873 --> 28:54.375
Yes, ma'am, I should be.

28:54.441 --> 28:56.310
I don't think you should be in here.

28:56.377 --> 28:58.245
Well, I can appreciate that.

28:58.312 --> 29:00.614
But I'm doing work
on your daughter's behalf.

29:00.681 --> 29:03.617
On your best day, you couldn't
replace my daughter.

29:03.684 --> 29:09.123
If you so much as move
a knickknack on this desk, and I'll...

29:09.189 --> 29:10.958
You'll?

29:13.694 --> 29:15.262
I'll call your wife.

29:15.329 --> 29:17.498
[laughs]

29:17.564 --> 29:20.501
Now that's a conversation
I would love to hear.

29:23.971 --> 29:27.775
She should've been out by now.
Is there any word from Jim?

29:27.841 --> 29:30.611
Jim says the speaker's
behaving himself, mostly.

29:30.678 --> 29:33.347
- Sir.
- Oh, thanks, Vince.

29:33.414 --> 29:35.916
Would anyone mind
if I just turn on the...

29:35.983 --> 29:38.919
[woman] While locals are concerned
about her well-being,

29:38.986 --> 29:40.654
there is now some criticism.

29:40.721 --> 29:44.291
Why did it take an illness
to get the president to Omaha?

29:44.358 --> 29:46.961
- Sorry.
- [elevator bell dings]

29:47.027 --> 29:48.028
Rod.

29:48.095 --> 29:50.464
Oh, hey. So how is she?

29:50.531 --> 29:52.066
She's fine. She's fine.

29:52.132 --> 29:55.703
Uh, the damage was more
than expected, but they did a great job.

29:55.769 --> 29:57.137
Expect 100% recovery.

29:57.204 --> 29:58.839
So is she awake?

29:58.906 --> 30:00.941
No. She should sleep most of the night.

30:01.008 --> 30:02.643
Yeah. Um...

30:02.710 --> 30:05.212
So these complications, were they...

30:05.279 --> 30:07.414
It got dicey for a while,

30:07.481 --> 30:09.550
but she's tough.

30:09.616 --> 30:11.051
Yeah.

30:11.118 --> 30:14.221
Guess you don't get to be president
without being made of steel.

30:14.288 --> 30:17.992
Yeah. Thanks. OK.

30:18.058 --> 30:20.961
Three more airlines
have filed for bankruptcy.

30:21.028 --> 30:23.864
Over 20,000 are on the verge
of losing their jobs.

30:23.931 --> 30:27.401
The country's in shambles. You'll
get no arguments from me, but...

30:27.468 --> 30:30.004
Four million Americans are stranded.

30:30.070 --> 30:32.072
Hub economies are in the crapper.

30:32.139 --> 30:33.874
The president's out of surgery.

30:33.941 --> 30:37.444
She's resting comfortably,
but out until morning.

30:37.511 --> 30:39.013
We've got bonus hours.

30:39.079 --> 30:41.782
[Alice] To haul the members
of Congress in on a dime...

30:41.849 --> 30:44.318
You're the most influential
members of the House.

30:44.385 --> 30:45.886
No, that would be your boss.

30:45.953 --> 30:48.655
Something's gotta be done,
and she's not gonna do it.

30:48.722 --> 30:52.459
I'm confident that between the four of
us, if we call an emergency session...

30:52.526 --> 30:54.995
If we submit a mandatory
arbitration resolution,

30:55.062 --> 30:57.898
there is no guarantee
we'll get the necessary votes.

30:57.965 --> 30:58.966
We'll get 'em.

30:59.033 --> 31:01.869
Or that the NMB panel
will vote in favor of management,

31:01.935 --> 31:04.271
and force the unions
to swallow a contract.

31:04.338 --> 31:06.573
It's so obvious
it's the right thing to do.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.142
NMB will see that.

31:08.208 --> 31:09.410
If worst comes to worst,

31:09.476 --> 31:12.813
there isn't a member of that
mediation board I haven't teed off with.

31:12.880 --> 31:14.948
Guys, this one
is for the country. Come on.

31:31.498 --> 31:33.167
It won't stand.

31:34.001 --> 31:35.636
What's going on, Jim?

31:35.702 --> 31:39.673
Where's your party allegiance,
your loyalty to Teddy?

31:39.740 --> 31:42.443
The woman's sprinkled
pixie dust in your eyes? What?

31:42.509 --> 31:44.578
I serve at the pleasure
of the president.

31:44.645 --> 31:46.947
Well, you should make
a little more effort.

31:47.014 --> 31:48.782
I'm not pleased.

31:48.849 --> 31:53.320
- [footsteps]
- It passed, mandatory arbitration.

31:53.387 --> 31:55.856
The National Mediation Board's
signing it now.

31:55.923 --> 31:57.791
Wonderful.

31:58.826 --> 32:00.828
This isn't the end of it, Nate.

32:04.431 --> 32:06.633
Jim appears to be losing it.

32:07.601 --> 32:09.369
You must be exhausted.

32:10.504 --> 32:12.339
Why don't you get some sleep?

32:12.406 --> 32:14.208
I'll sleep when I'm dead.

32:26.386 --> 32:29.556
Tell me you're not trying
to influence the press, Mr. McDonald.

32:29.623 --> 32:31.925
I'm just asking you
to keep it in perspective.

32:31.992 --> 32:34.995
What the speaker did was
a temporary fix, a cheap band-aid.

32:35.062 --> 32:38.031
That band-aid means that
I get to visit my sister in Tampa.

32:38.098 --> 32:40.901
It's grandstanding, a commercial
spot in the Super Bowl.

32:40.968 --> 32:44.638
Yeah, and it's the best news
I've had to report in a very long time.

32:44.705 --> 32:47.841
He's got something
Mackenzie Allen doesn't have:

32:47.908 --> 32:49.143
Balls.

32:49.209 --> 32:51.245
[chuckles]

32:51.311 --> 32:53.847
[man] The President
of the United States.

32:53.914 --> 32:55.749
Good morning.

32:55.816 --> 32:57.818
[reporters] Good morning.

32:58.819 --> 33:01.221
Just moments ago,

33:01.288 --> 33:04.591
because of a mandatory
arbitration resolution

33:04.658 --> 33:07.327
passed in the House
with the brave help

33:07.394 --> 33:10.797
of Representatives
Pasternak and Marlow,

33:10.864 --> 33:13.367
the National Mediation Board has ruled

33:13.433 --> 33:15.802
that the latest offer of the airlines

33:15.869 --> 33:18.272
is fair and just,

33:18.338 --> 33:21.008
and they have ordered
ALPA to accept it,

33:21.074 --> 33:24.778
which means that, effective immediately,

33:24.845 --> 33:28.782
the strike that has frozen
the nation's travel industry,

33:28.849 --> 33:30.517
has threatened our economy,

33:30.584 --> 33:33.587
has stood to ruin this holiday weekend

33:33.654 --> 33:35.656
of the American people,

33:35.722 --> 33:37.057
has ended.

33:37.591 --> 33:39.726
Mr. President. Mr. President.

33:39.793 --> 33:41.528
Charlie, yeah.

33:41.595 --> 33:43.964
How long is the agreement
expected to last?

33:44.031 --> 33:46.099
You know, I... I don't think

33:46.166 --> 33:49.369
anybody will be interested in hobbling

33:49.436 --> 33:52.606
the nation's travel anytime again soon.

33:52.673 --> 33:54.374
- [man] Mr. President.
- Roger.

33:54.441 --> 33:58.178
Mr. President, what does your first
presidential victory feel like?

33:59.613 --> 34:02.783
I don't think this is a victory for me.

34:02.849 --> 34:04.985
I think this is a victory

34:05.052 --> 34:06.787
for the American people.

34:06.853 --> 34:08.422
[reporters] Mr. President.

34:08.487 --> 34:10.757
- Back there...
- [woman] President Allen...

34:10.824 --> 34:12.659
- Unbelievable.
- That's scary.

34:12.726 --> 34:14.460
- Dad, can he do that?
- He just did.

34:14.527 --> 34:17.264
Rod. Rod. The, uh, president's awake.

34:17.331 --> 34:19.099
Oh, great.

34:19.166 --> 34:20.434
OK.

34:20.500 --> 34:22.636
[man] ...a victory. You know...

34:23.704 --> 34:26.706
Hey. You had us going for a while there.

34:29.208 --> 34:31.777
This is not the same day, is it?

34:32.779 --> 34:35.549
- Was I out all night?
- Pretty much.

34:37.818 --> 34:39.820
Don't you do that ever again.

34:39.886 --> 34:41.188
Mm.

34:42.155 --> 34:43.790
I don't think I can.

34:43.857 --> 34:46.827
I'm pretty sure I only have
one appendix.

34:46.893 --> 34:48.228
Smartass.

34:48.295 --> 34:49.696
[chuckles]

34:49.763 --> 34:51.632
So...

34:51.697 --> 34:53.634
...anything bad happen?

34:53.699 --> 34:58.305
Union representatives are crying foul
over the forced mediation.

34:58.372 --> 35:01.074
But they plan to take legal action.

35:01.141 --> 35:03.443
Acting president Nathan Templeton

35:03.510 --> 35:05.445
was said to have been "highly im...

35:05.512 --> 35:07.180
[mutes TV]

35:07.247 --> 35:08.849
UK doesn't get him elected.

35:08.915 --> 35:11.418
It's not just international
that sees it that way.

35:11.485 --> 35:15.188
'"The speaker has been more effective
in resolving this thing in 24 hours

35:15.255 --> 35:17.591
than Mackenzie Allen
has been in two weeks.'

35:17.658 --> 35:20.460
This according to Bill Pasternak,
Ohio Congressman."

35:20.527 --> 35:23.297
On every morning news show
he can get himself booked on.

35:23.363 --> 35:25.299
The speaker's made himself a folk hero.

35:25.365 --> 35:26.867
Not a good thing.

35:26.933 --> 35:28.735
Worse. It completely blows.

35:28.802 --> 35:32.205
Mr. Gardner, the president's awake.
They're briefing her now.

35:38.378 --> 35:40.314
The president's resuming office.

35:40.380 --> 35:42.215
She's being briefed as we speak.

35:42.282 --> 35:43.750
Attagirl.

35:44.985 --> 35:48.522
I assume my Secret Service detail
will give us a lift home?

35:48.588 --> 35:50.390
Of course.

35:50.457 --> 35:52.559
You give her my best.

35:55.362 --> 35:57.164
It was nice while it lasted.

35:57.230 --> 35:59.099
Savor the memory.

36:00.167 --> 36:02.235
Oh, you should, too, Jim.

36:02.302 --> 36:04.604
Thank you very much.
You were wonderful.

36:04.671 --> 36:06.673
[man] Thank you, sir.

36:11.478 --> 36:13.947
Bed rest, plain and simple.

36:14.014 --> 36:15.716
Try telling her that.

36:15.782 --> 36:19.619
These workers will almost certainly
strike at the end of this 60-day period.

36:19.686 --> 36:22.556
And guess what.
It's their right to do so.

36:22.622 --> 36:26.760
Not separately, together. In person, in
the Roosevelt Room, first thing Monday.

36:26.827 --> 36:29.262
I don't care that it's a holiday.

36:29.329 --> 36:31.164
Thanks, Jim.

36:32.299 --> 36:33.967
When's the soonest I can leave?

36:34.034 --> 36:36.470
You're starting to sound
like a typical patient.

36:36.536 --> 36:41.007
I'm feeling much better, and I happen
to travel with my own doc 24/7.

36:41.074 --> 36:42.376
Nice try.

36:42.442 --> 36:44.578
Uh, the earliest...

36:44.644 --> 36:46.146
It's not my ideal choice,

36:46.213 --> 36:49.583
but maybe with a health care crew
aboard, first thing in the morning.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.686
Good. The country
needs to know I'm back.

36:52.753 --> 36:55.422
[man] ...the President
of the United States.

36:55.489 --> 36:56.723
Good morning.

36:56.790 --> 36:58.925
[reporters] Good morning, Mr. President.

36:58.992 --> 37:03.163
Effective immediately,
the strike that has

37:03.230 --> 37:05.632
frozen the nation's travel industry,

37:05.699 --> 37:07.534
has threatened our economy,

37:07.601 --> 37:10.537
has stood to ruin
this holiday weekend

37:10.604 --> 37:13.707
of the American people, has ended.

37:13.774 --> 37:16.009
[applause]

37:16.076 --> 37:18.278
- [Charlie] Mr. President.
- Charlie, yeah.

37:18.345 --> 37:21.148
How long is the agreement
expected to last?

37:21.214 --> 37:24.084
The good news is it's over.

37:24.151 --> 37:28.021
The bad news is we just have
to live with the consequences.

37:28.088 --> 37:30.490
[Templeton] Yes, ma'am.

37:33.693 --> 37:36.363
- Sarah?
- [Sarah] Sweetheart.

37:39.666 --> 37:43.870
I was beginning to wonder
if you were ever coming home.

37:43.937 --> 37:46.106
It was a lifetime, Sarah.

37:46.173 --> 37:48.575
A lifetime in 24 hours.

37:48.642 --> 37:51.845
I saw you on television.
In fact, I saw you all over television.

37:51.912 --> 37:54.314
What a national platform.

37:54.381 --> 37:57.818
Well, how was it? As if I didn't know.

37:57.884 --> 37:59.886
You want the unvarnished truth?

37:59.953 --> 38:01.521
Always.

38:01.588 --> 38:04.391
With the singular exception
of our wedding day...

38:05.525 --> 38:08.028
...it was the best day of my life.

38:10.230 --> 38:13.733
Just please tell me
she won't be in a wheelchair.

38:13.800 --> 38:15.001
Doctor's orders.

38:15.068 --> 38:16.436
Doctors don't poll.

38:16.503 --> 38:20.507
[man on TV] ...condition remains
guarded. And here she is.

38:20.574 --> 38:23.643
Or rather,
First Gentleman Rod Calloway.

38:23.710 --> 38:26.313
And, yes, here is the president now,

38:26.379 --> 38:28.982
looking fit, walking comfortably.

38:29.049 --> 38:33.587
No doubt glad to be home
after an arduous few days.

38:36.790 --> 38:38.925
- [exhales]
- How'd she do?

38:40.494 --> 38:42.562
A picture's worth a thousand words.

38:50.237 --> 38:52.272
- Mommy!
- Oh, baby girl.

38:52.339 --> 38:54.374
- Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.
- I missed you.

38:54.441 --> 38:57.444
- I missed you, too.
- This is for you.

38:57.511 --> 39:00.213
[Kate] Hey.
Didn't I say you were clammy?

39:00.280 --> 39:01.448
Oh.

39:01.515 --> 39:03.049
Let's get this one to bed.

39:03.116 --> 39:04.784
I'll rest for a while,

39:04.851 --> 39:07.287
but I want to see Nathan tonight.

39:20.100 --> 39:21.835
Madam President.

39:21.902 --> 39:23.503
Mr. Speaker.

39:23.570 --> 39:25.272
Good of you to come.

39:25.338 --> 39:27.674
[chuckling] You look great.

39:27.741 --> 39:31.111
An appendix, are you sure it's OK
for you to be up and around?

39:37.384 --> 39:40.086
Did you really think you had the right

39:40.153 --> 39:42.856
to come in here
and make policy changes?

39:42.923 --> 39:45.158
Not only the right, but the obligation.

39:45.225 --> 39:47.127
I saw what I thought, what I think,

39:47.193 --> 39:49.863
is the perfect solution
to the desperate problem

39:49.930 --> 39:53.867
that this nation was facing,
and I enacted it.

39:53.934 --> 39:57.037
My mediation team was on the verge

39:57.103 --> 40:01.274
of getting a concession from the workers
that would've resulted in a contract

40:01.341 --> 40:04.010
that both labor and management
could've signed.

40:04.077 --> 40:05.745
That's not going to happen now

40:05.812 --> 40:07.747
because all of the good will

40:07.814 --> 40:10.183
that was cultivated
in getting there is gone.

40:10.250 --> 40:11.585
That's not true.

40:11.651 --> 40:13.453
You know it and I know it.

40:13.520 --> 40:16.823
You were no closer
to an agreement yesterday

40:16.890 --> 40:19.025
than you were a month ago.

40:19.092 --> 40:22.696
This country could not wait any longer.

40:22.762 --> 40:26.266
So I acted on this country's behalf.

40:26.333 --> 40:28.301
You didn't do this for the country.

40:28.368 --> 40:30.270
You didn't do it on anyone's behalf.

40:30.337 --> 40:33.006
You used this office,

40:33.073 --> 40:36.009
you used the American people

40:36.076 --> 40:37.711
for your campaign,

40:37.777 --> 40:39.279
for your cronies,

40:39.346 --> 40:41.615
for your massive ego.

40:41.681 --> 40:44.150
That's nonsense.
What I did I did for this country.

40:44.217 --> 40:47.354
I liberated it. You couldn't make
a decision from this office.

40:47.420 --> 40:48.955
Well, I could and I did.

40:52.993 --> 40:56.162
And if I ever needed another reason...

40:56.229 --> 40:59.299
...to prevent you from holding
this office, I have it now.

40:59.366 --> 41:02.702
And I'm going to do
everything in my power,

41:02.769 --> 41:04.638
and I have the power,

41:04.704 --> 41:06.706
to see that that never happens.

41:07.874 --> 41:11.378
You can't prevent me
from holding this office.

41:11.444 --> 41:14.247
That's for the people to decide.

41:15.248 --> 41:17.751
You have crossed the line with me,

41:17.817 --> 41:19.819
and there is no going back.

41:21.087 --> 41:23.523
Now get the hell out of my office.

41:26.026 --> 41:27.627
Yes, ma'am.
