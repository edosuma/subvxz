WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.320
.

00:07.280 --> 00:10.880
The Geordies are back. We're leaving
the Toon and hitting Greece.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.240
Greece, you're about to get done.

00:14.320 --> 00:16.080
(cheering)

00:16.160 --> 00:17.640
Come on!

00:18.200 --> 00:20.680
It's gonna be pool parties...

00:20.760 --> 00:23.240
Boat parties...
(cheering)

00:23.320 --> 00:24.440
More drama...

00:25.840 --> 00:27.840
Fuck this shit! I'm not doing it.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.120
More tashing on...

00:33.000 --> 00:34.560
More fucking tragedy...

00:35.840 --> 00:36.840
Slag!

00:36.920 --> 00:38.280
(shouting)

00:38.360 --> 00:39.680
(sighs)

00:39.760 --> 00:41.760
Don't fucking
ever speak to me again.

00:45.680 --> 00:47.200
Total carnage.

00:49.880 --> 00:52.080
Fuck. Shit. What have I done now?

00:55.320 --> 00:57.120
And a shit load of buckin', like.

01:00.240 --> 01:04.800
Greece, the Geordie gods are coming.
Time to get immortal.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.120
(laughter)

01:08.360 --> 01:10.960
I'm so happy
that the family is back together.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.440
(cheering)

01:12.520 --> 01:15.280
Hi, everybody!
Me and Mitch are so serious,

01:15.360 --> 01:18.200
I even got his initial
tattooed on the back of me arm.

01:18.280 --> 01:21.320
Gary!I've got a girlfriend,
Charlotte's got a boyfriend.

01:21.400 --> 01:25.160
Why am I still picking her up off
the floor when she's fucking smashed?

01:25.240 --> 01:26.320
Oh!
Ooh.

01:27.800 --> 01:31.400
I do really, really like Scott,
but I don't wanna get hurt again.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.280
Ew!

01:34.360 --> 01:37.600
Shit, we've already kissed.
It's only the first night.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.240
She needs to be careful.

01:39.320 --> 01:42.360
How's it gonna be with you
and Aaron?We're just friends.

01:42.440 --> 01:45.480
Marnie's in a new relationship
and it's serious.

01:45.560 --> 01:46.880
I love you.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.320
The kind of serious where
she doesn't cheat on him with Aaron.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.400
(laughs)

01:51.480 --> 01:53.200
Me and Kyle are totally in love,

01:53.280 --> 01:55.640
and we're just getting
better and better.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.280
(screams)

01:58.360 --> 02:00.840
I thought Holly and Kyle
were a happy couple.

02:02.840 --> 02:05.800
Yes, we argue,
but we always come back together.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.600
(moaning)

02:09.560 --> 02:11.720
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:11.800 --> 02:14.240
I've never kissed anyone
without a six pack.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.840
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:16.920 --> 02:18.920
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.200
I'm totally crackers me, like.

02:21.280 --> 02:22.920
I'm preened to perfection.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.880
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.080
I'm fit, flirty
and I've got double F's.

02:27.160 --> 02:29.840
I'm gonna make sparks fly
and get everyone feisty.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.920
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:36.320 --> 02:40.640
(phone ringing)

02:45.440 --> 02:48.840
I'm absolutely flat out
dreaming about wicked things

02:48.920 --> 02:52.320
and the phone is going berserk.
Who the fuck is that?

02:53.520 --> 02:57.240
Shock, it's Anna. I don't know
if she's been playing with herself,

02:57.320 --> 03:00.080
but it is nay joy
ringing at this time of night.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.960
Where's that?

03:10.160 --> 03:13.080
I don't know what's worse.
Anna waking us up,

03:13.160 --> 03:15.240
or waking up this bunch of pricks.

03:18.200 --> 03:21.560
What?Why does she tell us
so last minute every time?

03:21.640 --> 03:23.880
I don't think she realises
the time zone.

03:23.960 --> 03:28.680
Well, this is great. Do you know
what really cures my hangovers?

03:28.760 --> 03:32.760
A couple of hours' sleep
and a mad dash to the airport.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.480
I can't wait.

03:40.560 --> 03:42.400
'This is bad crack this, like.'

03:42.480 --> 03:46.200
Now I know how the girls feel when I
haul 'em out at six in the morning.

03:47.240 --> 03:50.960
'Everyone looks like total shit,
but I cannot wait to get to Crete.'

03:51.040 --> 03:53.400
I don't know where it is
but it sounds lethal.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.560
(cheering)

03:58.640 --> 04:00.520
I wanna get straight in the mixer.

04:00.600 --> 04:04.720
We've finally arrived in Crete and
I've left me hangover on the plane.

04:04.800 --> 04:08.680
Full speed ahead to Malia,
party capital!

04:10.160 --> 04:11.360
Malia!

04:11.440 --> 04:14.280
Malia, Malia, Malia! Here we come!

04:18.880 --> 04:20.160
'I'm fucking buzzing.'

04:20.240 --> 04:23.160
I hope the next villa
is even better than the last one.

04:24.480 --> 04:27.440
I didn't know there was
so much countryside in Greece.

04:27.520 --> 04:31.760
We've been driving for ages.
I hope this villa's worth it.

04:31.840 --> 04:34.000
Round this corner.
Round this corner.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.480
(Kyle)I fucking hate farms.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.200
'Why would Anna do this to us?'

04:39.280 --> 04:41.320
I know I smashed the place up
in Zante,

04:41.400 --> 04:45.080
but this is no reason to punish us.
I'd never send me worst enemy here.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.720
Gone from Greek Gods
to fucking peasants.

04:47.800 --> 04:51.400
Oh, nah, nah, not a fucking chance.
(Nathan)It stinks.

04:51.480 --> 04:55.800
Holly and Charlotte
can trash this villa all they want.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.120
It can't get any worse.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.640
Boys are up here. It's four beds.

05:00.720 --> 05:04.240
We've gone back in time.
The staircase is fucking homemade.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.240
Yeah, get me off these stairs.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.120
One mirror
for all of us to fight over.

05:10.200 --> 05:14.120
# Anna MacDonald sent us to a farm
Ee-aye-ee-aye-o

05:14.200 --> 05:16.720
# And we're all too hot
And we're all fucked off

05:16.800 --> 05:18.400
# And we're not gonna do any work.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.520
# And Scott's not gonna pull his gun
And shag a sheep

05:20.600 --> 05:22.760
# And I'm gonna chase all the geese
Ee-aye-ee-aye-o #

05:22.840 --> 05:24.720
Thanks, Anna.
(sheep bleat)

05:26.400 --> 05:27.520
(screams)

05:29.440 --> 05:30.760
There's a door here.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.160
This is the shag pad!

05:32.240 --> 05:35.800
'The shag pad is just a barn.
There's live animals in there.'

05:35.880 --> 05:39.560
I don't mind cocks, but chickens,
that's taking the piss.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.480
(coughs)
Don't, Charlotte.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.000
(retches)

05:43.080 --> 05:44.400
(Chloe)That is rotten!

05:44.480 --> 05:46.680
Don't get us wrong, I love chickens,

05:46.760 --> 05:50.360
but I am not daring sharing
a fucking bed with the bastards.

05:50.440 --> 05:52.080
That's the shag pad.

05:52.160 --> 05:54.440
Go right in.
Oh, you fuckers!

05:54.520 --> 05:57.080
Wow! There's actually
a shag pad here.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.440
Oh, I fucking hate chickens!

05:59.520 --> 06:02.080
(screaming)

06:03.760 --> 06:05.480
(laughter)

06:05.560 --> 06:07.320
How's it smelling?

06:09.680 --> 06:11.880
I can just see it now,
chatting to a bird,

06:11.960 --> 06:13.760
"Do you wanna come back to mine?"

06:13.840 --> 06:17.600
"I live an hour away, me bed's made
out of hay, and while we're banging,

06:17.680 --> 06:20.880
we're gonna get watched
by three ducks and a fucking goat."

06:20.960 --> 06:22.400
"No, Scott, I'm alreet."

06:30.360 --> 06:31.680
(laughs)

06:31.760 --> 06:33.680
What you getting ready for, Chlo?

06:33.760 --> 06:36.920
I'm gonna go ask Scott
if he wants to go on an adventure.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.360
Kissing Scott has made us realise
I do have feelings for him,

06:40.440 --> 06:42.440
so I'm gonna see what he's thinking.

06:42.520 --> 06:45.680
I don't know what he wants.
You don't know where you stand?

06:45.760 --> 06:47.240
It's been peeling me mind.

06:47.320 --> 06:50.960
Scott needs to man up and find his
balls, cos he's leading Chloe on.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.880
He either likes her or he doesn't.

06:53.840 --> 06:54.880
Ooh, shit.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.200
Oi, oi!
Hi.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.440
There's fuck all going on here,
so OK then, Chloe,

07:03.520 --> 07:06.280
let's see what these mountains
have to offer.

07:11.920 --> 07:13.960
Pure winery.
Trying to get us pissed?

07:14.040 --> 07:16.080
It's the first stage
of leading him on.

07:16.160 --> 07:19.280
He's not gonna know what hit him.
Baboom!

07:20.640 --> 07:22.200
(squeals)
What, man?

07:23.800 --> 07:25.400
Any reason to get close to me?

07:25.480 --> 07:28.240
No. I'll sit over there
if you want us to.

07:28.320 --> 07:31.440
I think Chloe has managed
to con us into a date.

07:31.520 --> 07:33.720
Let's do a cheers quickly.
Cheers, kid.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.120
For what to what though?
To friendship?

07:37.120 --> 07:38.360
Aye.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.120
And the rest.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.320
Buzzing.

07:50.280 --> 07:51.680
All right?
Good.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.400
Thank you.
What's happening?

07:53.480 --> 07:57.600
Scott is still nowhere to be seen.
He's either seriously grafting Chloe

07:57.680 --> 08:00.520
or the divvies
are stuck up a mountain somewhere.

08:04.400 --> 08:08.200
He says, "I wouldn't go there. I
wouldn't do this, wouldn't do that."

08:08.280 --> 08:11.600
The minute she flirts with you,
he's like, "Howay, Chloe!"

08:11.680 --> 08:14.120
If Chloe flirts with me,
Scott's all over her.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.680
If Marnie flirts with me,
Scott's all over her.

08:16.760 --> 08:19.000
Why doesn't Scott
start being all over me?

08:19.080 --> 08:20.280
It's a fucking joke.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.920
'The more it's feeling like a date.'

08:29.000 --> 08:30.560
It's not often a boy gives us

08:30.640 --> 08:32.840
a warm, fuzzy feeling
like Scott is now.

08:32.920 --> 08:35.240
Scott, I need to tell you something.
What?

08:35.320 --> 08:38.760
I wanna know where I stand, cos
I do actually like you, obviously.

08:38.840 --> 08:40.520
Chloe is looking decent,

08:40.600 --> 08:43.960
but I cannot see myself wifed in
when I'm on me holidays.

08:44.040 --> 08:47.720
I'm having a laugh, like. I'm not
really committing to anything.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.160
Yeah, I don't wanna commit.
I'm on holiday.

08:50.240 --> 08:53.800
I'm scared cos anything happens
between us and you just mug us off.

08:53.880 --> 08:57.200
I want Scott to say if anything
happened between me and him

08:57.280 --> 08:59.520
that he will not make us
look like a prat.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.680
What would you class as mugging off?

09:01.760 --> 09:03.880
You try and pull a lass
straight after.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.040
What would you class
as straight after? The next night.

09:07.120 --> 09:10.200
When we do have sex,
I won't do that again. If we do.

09:11.560 --> 09:15.440
I can blast Chloe as long as I don't
blast another girl the next night.

09:15.520 --> 09:18.520
I cannot make promises,
but it sounds like a good deal.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.560
Shall we decide
when I'm sat on your knee?

09:28.640 --> 09:31.560
I'm feeling a bit tipsy
so I can't really say no, can I?

09:35.800 --> 09:38.680
You never know,
maybe this could go somewhere.

09:43.400 --> 09:44.880
Oh, my God, a horse!

09:44.960 --> 09:46.880
Oh, I've just stood in its shit.

09:49.040 --> 09:53.040
Me and Kyle are in a really good
place right now and I'm so happy.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.520
How bad was that shag pad?

09:55.720 --> 09:57.840
Is it chicken-less
or is it still there?

09:57.920 --> 09:59.600
I'll get 'em out, don't worry.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.560
I wanna get me end away
and this chicken is in my way.

10:02.640 --> 10:03.680
Fuck off, mate.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.720
(screams)

10:07.800 --> 10:10.320
Kyle is screaming like a girl.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.520
It was just scary. Shall we
just leave the chicken for now?

10:13.600 --> 10:16.520
It's mine and Holly's
first holiday as a couple

10:16.600 --> 10:20.760
and we're gonna do what we do best
and buck all our grease.

10:20.840 --> 10:22.200
(moaning)

10:22.280 --> 10:25.880
All I can notice is hay bales and
a chicken at the bottom of the bed,

10:25.960 --> 10:27.400
but I'm gonna roll with it.

10:32.200 --> 10:36.040
This shag pad might be stinking,
but mine and Holly's sex is amazing.

10:36.120 --> 10:39.640
I can bang her in a bin lorry and
it would still be fucking wicked.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.480
When me and Kyle are good,
we're really fucking good.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.120
Even surrounded by animals.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.360
Tonight we're gonna hit up Malia.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.960
I hope my clothes
don't smell of chicken shit.

11:06.920 --> 11:09.480
There's nay chance
I'm bringing a bird back here

11:09.560 --> 11:12.840
to bang 'em in that shag pad.
I'm just gonna neck on with birds.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.240
You might as well
bring the girls back,

11:17.320 --> 11:20.040
cos once they get here
they can't fucking leave.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.320
So, Chloe, what happened with Scott?

11:27.400 --> 11:30.200
We just had a walk
to that fancy wine bar thing.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.600
It was so romantic.

11:31.680 --> 11:36.400
'Chloe seems to be buzzing about the
date she had earlier with Scotty.'

11:36.480 --> 11:37.880
I can tell she's so happy.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.560
We were kissing
and I wanted to jump on his dick.

11:40.640 --> 11:44.120
I really did.
I really wanted the dick.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.840
I bet that won't be hard.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.880
It's not like you need
a special ticket to ride Scotty T.

11:48.960 --> 11:52.040
It's a good sign. He must be
into you if he's kissing you.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.640
'The girls are loving
my news about Scott.'

11:54.720 --> 11:56.720
Might be more necking on tonight.

12:02.720 --> 12:03.720
Let's go, lads.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.800
This is our first night out in Malia.

12:05.880 --> 12:08.200
Believe me now,
this is about to go west.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.480
Yous ready?
Yes. Ready as ever.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.480
Malia, let's fucking do this!

12:16.400 --> 12:18.400
Buzzing about Malia, like. Whoo!

12:23.720 --> 12:26.280
Watch out Zig Zag,
we are going to zig,

12:26.360 --> 12:28.960
we're gonna zag,
we're gonna maybe even shag.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.640
What shape is a zig zag?

12:39.600 --> 12:42.920
'We've just got to the club
and Scott's looking cannae fit.'

12:43.000 --> 12:44.720
I'm gonna show him what I can do

12:44.800 --> 12:47.160
with a big shiny pole
in between me legs.

12:54.200 --> 12:58.040
I'm gonna get this party started
the only way I know how to.

12:58.120 --> 13:02.800
Jagerbombs! Jagerbombs! Jagerbombs!

13:02.880 --> 13:04.480
(cheering)

13:08.920 --> 13:11.040
'Marnie's looking
cannae fit tonight,

13:11.120 --> 13:13.400
and for some reason,
I wanna toast her.'

13:13.480 --> 13:14.880
Pass the fucking butter.

13:19.680 --> 13:22.760
I don't understand why
Scott's flirted with me all day,

13:22.840 --> 13:26.120
but at the club, he flirts
with Marnie. It pisses us off.

13:38.680 --> 13:41.400
Scott's flirting with us
and now Chloe's crying.

13:41.480 --> 13:45.840
I have flirted with Scott in
the past, but this has got to stop.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.840
All I did is neck on with her.
If that was the case,

13:58.920 --> 14:01.960
I'd be with half of Europe
and fucking all of Australia.

14:07.240 --> 14:11.080
I was looking forward to a massive
night out, but Chloe's been crying

14:11.160 --> 14:14.840
and me best friend Holly's been
glued to her boyfriend all night.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.040
Someone pass me a fucking drink.

14:25.520 --> 14:28.760
I need to tell Chloe that I told
Scott to stop flirting with us.

14:35.520 --> 14:40.200
I'm so glad Marnie's on my side.
I'm so fuming at Scott.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.720
'I don't know how, but somehow
I've got a girl in the area.'

14:50.800 --> 14:53.120
Scotty is gonna be
absolutely furious.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.960
Aaron might not be able to speak,

15:03.040 --> 15:05.440
but he's out the blocks quick
and got a bird.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.960
Is he off his fucking head?
I'm off on the pull.

15:30.640 --> 15:33.800
Don't take me out for wine
and fucking snog us

15:33.880 --> 15:37.040
and go get with other girls.
You're an absolute prick.

15:39.520 --> 15:43.720
Scott has been so insensitive.
I'm gonna have to get involved here.

16:04.240 --> 16:07.960
Marnie is cock-blocking us and
saying that I'm getting with Chloe.

16:08.040 --> 16:10.200
No, I'm not.
This is pissing me off now.

16:34.240 --> 16:40.040
I am the most mortal I have
ever been in my whole entire life.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.960
Once again,
things have gotten out of control.

16:44.040 --> 16:47.200
Chloe's going apeshit,
Scott's pissed off.

16:47.280 --> 16:50.360
It's time to call it a night
and head back to the farm.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.800
Let's go!

16:54.360 --> 16:58.440
I'm not gonna be anywhere near Chloe
and Marnie cos they ruined me night.

16:58.520 --> 17:01.920
So I'm gonna dive in a taxi
with Holly and Charlotte.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.280
Do you wanna swap seats?

17:11.280 --> 17:14.880
Chloe's had a shit night with Scott
and I wanna cheer her up.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.120
Who needs boys?

17:23.120 --> 17:25.080
Marnie's offering to share sex toys.

17:25.160 --> 17:28.160
She's being such a good friend,
I'm gonna give her a kiss.

17:28.240 --> 17:29.760
(boys) Whoa!

17:29.840 --> 17:33.800
If this is the kind of shit
that goes down in the girls' taxi,

17:33.880 --> 17:36.080
then fucking shotgun the girls' taxi!

17:36.160 --> 17:38.080
Marnie loves girls, man.

17:38.160 --> 17:41.440
Oh, shit. This is the greatest taxi
I've ever got in.

17:41.520 --> 17:45.280
I tell you what, I bet you the boys
were having a mint fucking time.

17:46.560 --> 17:49.960
Gary's got a semi on! (laughs)

17:50.040 --> 17:53.760
This is the best way I could've ever
taken Chloe's mind off Scott.

17:53.840 --> 17:57.720
Chloe, you are the best kisser
I've ever kissed, you know.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.440
Are you having a fucking laugh?
She's shit!

18:08.760 --> 18:12.800
I've succeeded in getting meself
absolutely smashed.

18:12.880 --> 18:15.360
The vodka's taking over us.

18:18.280 --> 18:19.400
Shh.
Ow.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.000
I don't know what has got
in the girls tonight.

18:22.080 --> 18:23.560
I know I'm irresistible,

18:23.640 --> 18:26.040
but Charlotte
cannae keep her hands off us.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.360
Oh, my God!

18:34.800 --> 18:36.160
'What?!'

18:36.240 --> 18:37.800
Scott?

18:40.680 --> 18:43.160
No!

18:46.040 --> 18:47.320
No, didn't do it!

18:47.400 --> 18:50.800
I'm always up for a frisk, like,
but necking on with Charlotte

18:50.880 --> 18:53.920
is like necking on
with me fucking sister. Nay joy.

18:57.320 --> 19:00.160
We're in a taxi on the way home
and I'm being woken up,

19:00.240 --> 19:04.240
and what the fuck is going on?
Charlotte and Scott are flirting.

19:11.120 --> 19:14.360
Right now, I can see that Charlotte
is absolutely smashed.

19:14.440 --> 19:17.600
She's not being herself.
I don't know what's got into her.

19:17.680 --> 19:21.680
Calm down. Don't speak about
anything else and it'll all be fine.

19:21.760 --> 19:25.280
Scott, keep your hands up here
and, Charlotte, just go to sleep.

19:25.360 --> 19:28.360
We'll be back in ten minutes
and we're gonna go to bed.

19:28.440 --> 19:31.000
Holly starts shouting at us
and I don't know why.

19:31.080 --> 19:33.760
She knows me and Scott
are like brother and sister.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.240
'We're just messing on.'

19:35.320 --> 19:38.800
Get your legs over there now.
I'm being fucking serious now.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.960
You will not like this
in the morning.

19:41.040 --> 19:43.440
What the fuck?
What am I doing that's bad?

19:43.520 --> 19:45.160
OK, do whatever you want.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.640
Charlotte is my best friend
in the world.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.360
I'm trying to look out for her.

19:49.440 --> 19:52.840
They aren't gonna get together,
so what the hell is she doing?

19:52.920 --> 19:55.360
Hols, don't do this. Don't.

19:55.440 --> 19:58.160
OK, that's fine, I won't.
No, I love you...

19:58.240 --> 20:02.320
So there you go, the light's off.
Do whatever the fuck you want.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.240
Fuck off.

20:08.080 --> 20:11.920
Hol, I don't wanna fall out.
You don't need to mention it now.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.520
We're back at the farm
and my head is spinning.

20:15.600 --> 20:19.160
In the space of one taxi journey,
I've managed to try it on with Scott

20:19.240 --> 20:21.560
and piss off Holly,
who was me best friend.

20:21.640 --> 20:25.880
Maybe if I just lie down and go to
sleep, all this mess will disappear.

20:28.280 --> 20:30.000
(laughter)

20:30.080 --> 20:31.920
(indistinct chatter)

20:36.560 --> 20:40.000
I'm gonna tell the kid what happened
between me and Charlotte,

20:40.080 --> 20:43.520
cos them two do have a bit of
history, and it's fucking lad code.

20:43.600 --> 20:46.440
I'm in the taxi with Charlotte,

20:46.520 --> 20:49.160
and obviously Charlotte's
pissed out her face,

20:49.240 --> 20:52.760
trying to grab me and I'm just like,
"Whoa, whoa, what the fuck?"

20:54.480 --> 20:58.520
Charlotte's putting Scott
in a very awkward position.

20:58.600 --> 21:03.160
Why? Why? Why would Charlotte
get in a taxi and graft you?

21:03.240 --> 21:06.320
Come on, she's only human.
Join the fucking queue.

21:07.360 --> 21:08.600
(belches)

21:11.160 --> 21:12.360
What the fuck?

21:12.440 --> 21:16.440
A swarm of bugs have invaded
the room and we're under attack.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.480
Ah, you fucking... Fuck, man.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.480
Oh, you fucking dick!

21:20.560 --> 21:21.920
Oh, you fucking critter.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.040
(shrieks)

21:23.120 --> 21:25.200
Gaz, man.
Stop fucking...

21:27.360 --> 21:30.960
Don't worry, lads,
I'll fucking fumigate the premises.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.520
(farting)

21:47.800 --> 21:49.880
(Holly sobs)

21:52.720 --> 21:56.400
It's been another crazy night,
and now Holly's crying her eyes out.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.480
All I wanna do is go to bed.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.600
I'm upset and all I want
is for Kyle to comfort me,

22:10.680 --> 22:12.600
but that seems
too much to ask of him.

22:14.560 --> 22:16.960
Oh, my God, man. Shut up.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.280
I'm fucking going to sleep, man.
I'm lying next to you.

22:21.360 --> 22:23.560
I need a cuddle
and he doesn't understand.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.320
(snores)

22:44.440 --> 22:49.000
I wake up next to Marnie and
I look at her, I'm thinking awks.

22:49.080 --> 22:52.080
And I can't even do
the walk of shame

22:52.160 --> 22:54.400
cos I'm in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

22:54.480 --> 22:59.200
Yous last night was fucking... Like,
it got so out of hand, you know.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.960
I, like...

23:01.040 --> 23:04.120
I have flashbacks.
I have flashbacks.

23:04.200 --> 23:07.880
Yous were all over each other.
Shit, does that mean I'm a lesbian?

23:07.960 --> 23:10.800
No. It just means that you fancy me
a little bit.Does it?

23:10.880 --> 23:15.040
Well, I suppose if Marnie's gonna
get some action from somewhere,

23:15.120 --> 23:16.600
it's better from a girl than Aaron.

23:16.680 --> 23:19.920
I'm sexually frustrated
because I'm missing me boyfriend.

23:20.000 --> 23:24.320
You've used and abused us and I've
been pied once again.(laughter)

23:24.400 --> 23:27.120
I'm getting pied
all over the shop here.

23:27.200 --> 23:31.440
I'm glad that me first
lesbian experience was with Chloe

23:31.520 --> 23:33.640
and we can have
a little giggle about it.

23:33.720 --> 23:37.600
(laughter)

23:42.440 --> 23:45.280
Fuck me, last night
was a bit lively, wasn't it?

23:45.360 --> 23:46.640
Fucking loose.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.640
I've woken up in this shitty barn.

23:51.720 --> 23:57.240
Was I dreaming or was I watching
Chloe and Marnie at a live sex show?

23:57.320 --> 24:01.160
I'm glad I was asleep because
I would've been trying to get in.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.520
Why wasn't I there?

24:02.600 --> 24:06.320
Gaz's taxi sounded wicked.
Chloe and Marnie having a pure frizz

24:06.400 --> 24:10.600
while Charlotte was cracking onto
me. Fucking liberty or what?!

24:10.680 --> 24:12.000
What did happen?

24:13.240 --> 24:16.160
And then she fucking grabs me head
and just goes mwah,

24:16.240 --> 24:18.080
and I was like, "What the fuck?"

24:18.160 --> 24:22.520
At least my bird's not trying
to neck on with Scotty T, like.

24:22.600 --> 24:26.760
Out of all this, the biggest fucking
shock is Aaron pulled last night.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.880
(laughter)

24:35.040 --> 24:39.400
I wanna check on Charlotte
after last night's taxi fiasco.

24:39.480 --> 24:40.760
Morning.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.040
Hi.
Hi.

24:42.120 --> 24:45.480
What the hell was going on
last night? Everything was going on.

24:45.560 --> 24:51.160
I felt like... there was a little
bit of, like, flirtiness with Scott.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.640
I kissed Scott.

24:53.720 --> 24:57.200
Apparently, Scott and Charlotte
kissed. What the fuck?

24:57.280 --> 24:59.640
'I look like a mug once again.'

24:59.720 --> 25:03.240
You were just really, really drunk.
Nah, it's not on what I did.

25:03.320 --> 25:06.760
It's not the correct behaviour
for someone in a relationship.

25:06.840 --> 25:11.000
Vodka, you are no longer a friend of
mine. What the hell was I thinking?

25:11.080 --> 25:12.480
With Scott?
Exactly.

25:12.560 --> 25:15.440
That doesn't make sense.
It doesn't make sense.

25:15.520 --> 25:18.800
You don't fancy him.
(sighs)

25:18.880 --> 25:20.880
I feel so, so sorry for Charlotte.

25:20.960 --> 25:23.360
But she needs to realise
that what she's done

25:23.440 --> 25:25.920
isn't actually as bad as she thinks.

25:29.640 --> 25:33.080
You're punishing yourself
for something that isn't a big deal.

25:33.160 --> 25:35.280
It's not like
you've shagged someone.

25:35.360 --> 25:38.880
You don't fancy Scott and you've
just gotta take it as what it is.

25:38.960 --> 25:40.800
You were just drunk and stupid.

25:40.880 --> 25:43.400
Holly's right.
What happened meant nothing.

25:43.480 --> 25:47.000
It's just so weird. Me and Scott
are like brother and sister.

25:47.080 --> 25:52.600
This barn has just sent everyone
bat-shit crazy.

26:02.120 --> 26:04.320
Last night, Holly was crying in bed.

26:04.400 --> 26:07.640
I can't be doing with negativity
so I check if she's all right.

26:07.720 --> 26:10.000
You seemed pissed off
when you got back.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.960
I was just upset about everything.

26:14.160 --> 26:17.840
Last night, I did get upset because
I wanted Kyle to be there for us,

26:17.920 --> 26:19.840
and he wasn't. He just fell asleep.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.120
Usually he'd wait
till after we had sex.

26:22.200 --> 26:25.440
So, I'm just saying
I just need you as a friend a well.

26:25.520 --> 26:29.200
In a relationship, you have got
somebody else to think about.

26:29.280 --> 26:31.520
I understand
that Holly was upset,

26:31.600 --> 26:33.960
but I was extremely drunk
last night.

26:34.040 --> 26:37.080
If she wants to talk,
we could've done it in the morning.

26:37.160 --> 26:40.760
I just felt a bit alone, that's all.

26:45.160 --> 26:47.000
I'm sweating my fucking dick off.

26:47.080 --> 26:50.600
I'm sick of this place. It's got
nae swimming pools and nae nowt.

26:50.680 --> 26:54.000
I'm gonna go find a well or
a fucking puddle to put me face in.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.280
Leave us a fucking paddle pool, mate.

26:57.280 --> 27:00.160
Yeah, we'll ask this raji.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:00.240 --> 27:03.320
Yeah, mate, do you know
where there's a swimming pool?

27:03.400 --> 27:05.240
Down this way.
Down there?

27:05.320 --> 27:09.120
(excited chatter, laughter)

27:09.200 --> 27:11.000
To the pool!

27:11.080 --> 27:12.640
In Newcastle, we get taxis.

27:12.720 --> 27:15.560
In Greece,
we get some old bloke on a tractor.

27:16.360 --> 27:18.480
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can you see anything?

27:18.560 --> 27:21.680
'I am so hot I cannot wait
to get there and have a dip.'

27:21.760 --> 27:24.520
I just hope it's one of them
wicked infinity pools.

27:24.600 --> 27:26.080
(laughs)

27:26.160 --> 27:27.560
Nae way!

27:27.640 --> 27:30.040
Is anything on this farm
fucking normal?

27:30.120 --> 27:31.360
Way old!

27:31.440 --> 27:33.480
This is a glorified tin bath.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.480
Whoo-hoo!

27:39.560 --> 27:41.600
This pool has worked
a fucking treat.

27:41.680 --> 27:45.360
I wish I knew about it, I would've
hoyed Charlotte in to cool her down.

27:45.440 --> 27:48.760
It was weird because
I'm close mates with Charlotte now.

27:48.840 --> 27:50.520
I'm just like, "What the fuck?"

27:50.600 --> 27:53.520
I don't think Charlotte's
got feelings for Scotty.

27:53.600 --> 27:57.320
She just can't control herself
when she's had a drink.

27:57.400 --> 28:00.720
I think initially she's gonna
be upset about what's happened.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.680
Any excuse to keep your bird out.
(laughter)

28:14.280 --> 28:16.320
(Nathan) So fucking hot.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.880
I need a drink, me.

28:17.960 --> 28:22.320
We all know that Chloe likes Scott,
so I wanna make sure she's OK.

28:22.400 --> 28:25.200
He's mugged you off twice in one day.
I know.

28:25.280 --> 28:27.920
Twice, Chloe.
I look like an absolute dickhead.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.560
I can't fathom why
he tried to get with Charlotte.

28:30.640 --> 28:33.200
I think he's doing everything
to piss me off.

28:33.280 --> 28:36.920
I think it's Scott's fault 100%.
He thinks it's a big joke.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.200
He doesn't care about
anyone's feelings.

28:39.280 --> 28:42.200
Why did I ever think that ever
something could happen

28:42.280 --> 28:43.400
when it's not?

28:43.480 --> 28:47.520
He doesn't care about me. I just
need to face facts, he doesn't care.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.520
I hate to see Chloe hurting,

28:49.600 --> 28:53.400
but maybe she might realise
that Scott's not boyfriend material.

28:53.480 --> 28:56.640
Say when we go out tonight,
if he starts flirting with you,

28:56.720 --> 28:58.320
just walk away from him.

28:58.400 --> 29:02.280
The only thing Scott deserves from
me right now is the cold shoulder.

29:02.360 --> 29:03.920
Shall we go back?
Yeah.

29:14.440 --> 29:18.120
We get back to the farm and Scott
says he needs to speak to Charlotte.

29:18.200 --> 29:21.240
Let's just hope she keeps her hands
to herself this time.

29:23.040 --> 29:24.960
It's like I've kissed me brother.

29:25.040 --> 29:27.240
I was like,
"What the fuck's she doing?"

29:27.320 --> 29:30.720
I can't really remember it
that much, but I'm quite glad,

29:30.800 --> 29:33.840
cos I think I'd feel weird
about it.(both laugh)

29:33.920 --> 29:35.440
It was a frisk.

29:35.520 --> 29:37.560
Tonight I'm gonna lay off the booze,

29:37.640 --> 29:41.800
because at this rate, I'm gonna be
calling Anna asking her for a kiss.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.360
(laughs)

29:47.440 --> 29:50.720
'I would never fancy Scott
in a million years.'

29:50.800 --> 29:52.520
I mean, I know where he's been.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.440
The barn is that scruffy
I've had to take a shower outside.

30:06.520 --> 30:09.560
'Good job I've got me lesbian
partner to scrub me back.'

30:09.640 --> 30:12.200
Right in there. Oh, yeah!

30:14.080 --> 30:16.000
Yeah, man, will yous two relax?

30:16.080 --> 30:18.080
I'm just rinsing her.

30:18.160 --> 30:20.800
Where's the popcorn?
I can watch this shit all day.

30:22.920 --> 30:25.080
Be sexy.
Oh, baby.

30:25.160 --> 30:26.960
(laughter)

30:28.080 --> 30:31.920
Chloe and Marnie have taken their
friendship to the next level.

30:35.120 --> 30:38.480
Oh, my God! What the fuck?!

30:38.560 --> 30:40.880
Nathan's getting a hard on!
What?!

30:40.960 --> 30:43.280
(laughter)

30:44.440 --> 30:46.600
'This farm is messing with my head.'

30:46.680 --> 30:49.280
These are like my sisters
and I've got a semi on.

30:49.360 --> 30:53.240
Chloe, so tonight, when you're horny,
are you going in for a bit of Scott,

30:53.320 --> 30:55.480
or fucking straight to Marnie?
Marnie.

30:55.560 --> 30:58.240
I'm not sure if I can go for Marnie.
Shotgun taxi!

30:58.320 --> 31:02.080
Maybe if you're lucky, Charlotte,
you could join in.(laughter)

31:02.160 --> 31:04.600
Three-way!
Oh! Fucking hell!

31:04.680 --> 31:07.600
Me and Chloe have clearly made
Gary and Nathan's day,

31:07.680 --> 31:11.760
but most of all we're buzzing to see
a smile on Charlotte's face again.

31:20.520 --> 31:22.800
Everyone's up for another night out,

31:22.880 --> 31:26.640
but I need to ring me boyfriend
and tell him that I kissed Chloe.

31:26.720 --> 31:29.000
"Hi."
You all right?

31:31.120 --> 31:33.120
I know. I'm missing you.

31:33.200 --> 31:36.040
We've been living on a farm.
Like, with...

31:36.120 --> 31:38.080
Yeah, with like animals.

31:38.160 --> 31:41.400
Oh, actually,
I've got something to tell you.

31:41.480 --> 31:44.680
I had a lesbian experience.

31:46.880 --> 31:49.120
You know Chloe?
Me and Chloe got it on.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.080
'Ricky's taken the news really well.'

31:54.160 --> 31:56.800
So well that he even wants
to watch it.

31:56.880 --> 32:00.400
I'm missing you that much,
I had to take all me vent out on her.

32:02.520 --> 32:03.720
I know.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.440
It's so good talking to Ricky.

32:05.520 --> 32:08.240
It's really made us realise
how much he means to us.

32:08.320 --> 32:11.640
No more kissing anyone in Greece,
whether it's a boy or a girl.

32:11.720 --> 32:14.360
Right, love you. Bye. Bye.

32:24.440 --> 32:26.240
Hi, Chlo.
Hi!

32:26.320 --> 32:28.320
You wanna come in the sitting room?

32:28.400 --> 32:31.360
Do you want to have sex with us
as well? Yeah, maybe.

32:31.440 --> 32:34.040
Talking to Scott
has made us feel loads better,

32:34.120 --> 32:36.520
but I know that Chloe's
got feelings for him

32:36.600 --> 32:40.320
and I definitely do not want her
to think I have as well.

32:40.400 --> 32:43.480
I didn't want you to think
that there was anything there.

32:43.560 --> 32:45.920
I've got a boyfriend
who I'm in love with,

32:46.000 --> 32:48.640
and my kiss with Scott
was nothing like yours.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.200
Was it a good kiss or not?

32:50.280 --> 32:53.640
It wasn't even really a kiss.
Like, he has never fancied me.

32:53.720 --> 32:56.560
It's so weird
why that would even happen.

32:56.640 --> 33:00.360
I appreciate Charlotte telling us
the kiss with Scott meant nothing.

33:00.440 --> 33:02.520
It's more than what he's done
all day.

33:02.600 --> 33:06.040
I look like such a mug.
You don't look like a mug, Chloe.

33:06.120 --> 33:10.320
It's just Scott, like,
he's gonna be a dickhead

33:10.400 --> 33:12.640
like all the other lads
in this house.

33:12.720 --> 33:14.800
I'm glad that we're OK.
Of course it is.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.800
Do you wanna go get ready?
Yeah.

33:16.880 --> 33:20.320
Let's go out and do it all again.
And let's get a neck on.

33:24.280 --> 33:27.520
Me and the girls are so excited
to have a good night tonight.

33:27.600 --> 33:32.120
I wanna have loads of fun, no drama,
and no lesbian taxi journeys.

33:32.200 --> 33:33.520
Girls, come on then!

33:34.800 --> 33:36.200
Whoop-whoop! Pied.

33:36.280 --> 33:39.760
Time to take these bunch of clowns
down to party town.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.200
Oi, oi!

33:42.840 --> 33:45.000
We've just touched down
in Malia town

33:45.080 --> 33:47.560
and it's time to get
fucking mortal.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.960
I'm so excited.
This club looks bouncing.

33:54.040 --> 33:56.840
The tunes are wicked
and I'm about to get smashed.

34:04.480 --> 34:06.960
(cheering)

34:23.680 --> 34:26.240
Sometimes I look at Aaron and Scott
in the club

34:26.320 --> 34:28.880
and I just wanna trade places
for the night.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
'When Kyle watches me and Scott pull
he gets jealous.'

34:36.080 --> 34:39.000
So why the fuck
are you in a relationship?

34:42.480 --> 34:44.760
Aaron is right,
I have got sex on tap.

34:44.840 --> 34:47.320
But I still miss
being with the lads.

34:54.800 --> 34:56.840
Kyle might not be able
to go on the pull,

34:56.920 --> 34:58.640
but me and Scott definitely can.

34:58.720 --> 35:02.120
Come on, mate, let's go and see
what this club has to offer.

35:17.400 --> 35:20.040
Sorry, Kyle,
Scott doesn't look like a peacock.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.640
He looks like an utter twat.

35:31.240 --> 35:33.560
The lads have came back
empty handed,

35:33.640 --> 35:36.200
and Scott has made a beeline
straight for Chloe.

35:38.880 --> 35:41.280
Usually I'd love to sit
on your knee, Scott,

35:41.360 --> 35:44.880
but after last night, you can go
and fuck yourself. Turbo twat.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.920
Chloe is having a go at Scott.
What does he expect?

35:54.000 --> 35:56.800
You took her on a date,
then totally mugged her off.

36:12.440 --> 36:14.360
How can Chloe be pissed off with me?

36:14.440 --> 36:17.160
I'm not pissed off
that she necked on with Marnie.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.720
I'm pure fucking buzzing.

36:20.960 --> 36:24.200
Maybe Scott shouldn't have acted
like such a dickhead.

36:24.280 --> 36:27.200
He made me think that
things were gonna go somewhere.

36:36.160 --> 36:37.920
Chloe's just pied us. Well, aye.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.160
After a few more drinks,
she'll be high diving off my chopper

36:41.240 --> 36:43.600
faster than Tom Daley
off a ten-metre board.

36:50.520 --> 36:52.680
I'm having so much fun in this club,

36:52.760 --> 36:56.200
and I'm just happy to be
spending some time with Holly.

37:02.840 --> 37:05.960
This is great.
Holly's actually gonna sack off Kyle

37:06.040 --> 37:08.400
and we're gonna share a bed
like old times.

37:11.840 --> 37:14.960
Saying no to Scott was hard,
but I put him in his place.

37:15.040 --> 37:19.440
I feel like such a strong,
independent woman. I am a legend.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.480
(all) Chloe, Chloe, Chloe!

37:27.600 --> 37:29.840
I'm giving Scott
a taste of his medicine.

37:29.920 --> 37:33.960
I'm gonna flirt with Aaron. I know
for a fact Scott'll be pissed off.

37:37.560 --> 37:41.720
When Chloe's pissed she always
ends up jumping all over us.

37:41.800 --> 37:45.240
I think she's trying to wind Scott
up, but I'm always up for that.

37:45.320 --> 37:47.040
On the cheek, go on.

37:47.120 --> 37:48.360
Oh, Chloe!

37:50.440 --> 37:53.640
Surprise, Surprise,
Chloe and Aaron are flirting again.

37:53.720 --> 37:56.920
Am I bothered?
Aye, I'm an emotional wreck.

38:00.480 --> 38:04.960
Scott says that he doesn't care, but
I reckon he's properly pissed off.

38:05.040 --> 38:08.800
Let's get out of this club and carry
on the banter back at the farm.

38:20.480 --> 38:23.520
Kyle's still saying that he's jealous
that he can't pull.

38:23.600 --> 38:27.000
When she's going, "Right,
this is what I wasn't happy about."

38:27.080 --> 38:30.000
I'm thinking in my head,
"I don't fucking care, man."

38:30.080 --> 38:31.160
I do love Holly,

38:31.240 --> 38:34.760
but it seems like all the fun's
been sucked out the relationship.

38:34.840 --> 38:37.800
She moans all the time
and it's starting to grate on us.

38:37.880 --> 38:40.800
Last night I pretended to be asleep
for half an hour

38:40.880 --> 38:44.440
just so she wouldn't speak to us
about the night. How bad is that?

38:44.520 --> 38:48.080
I was fucking lying there, I was
going... I even did some snores.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.520
(laughter)

38:49.600 --> 38:51.480
Fuck me, Holly's still one of us,

38:51.560 --> 38:55.720
and whatever's going on between them
two, she deserves better than that.

38:57.120 --> 38:58.960
So we finally get back to the shed

38:59.040 --> 39:01.640
after trekking across
the fucking Himalayas,

39:01.720 --> 39:04.600
I cannot wait to get out of
this shithole, me.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.600
(mumbles)

39:13.880 --> 39:15.600
I'm sleeping with her.
Sound.

39:15.680 --> 39:18.760
That's it, Kyle,
she's spending time with me tonight.

39:18.840 --> 39:20.880
Come on, Hols, budge over!

39:20.960 --> 39:22.880
I don't think we can both fit, Char.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.560
I'd rather just sleep on here
on me own.

39:27.560 --> 39:29.800
But look at how I am now.

39:29.880 --> 39:33.600
Cheers, Holly. Nothing like
being pied by your best mate.

39:33.680 --> 39:35.360
Kyle, come here a second.

39:36.400 --> 39:38.520
Shall I go in the other room then?

39:40.240 --> 39:41.960
You haven't left us much choice

39:42.040 --> 39:44.440
now you've asked your boyfriend
to join you,

39:44.520 --> 39:46.520
so I'm off to bed, Holly, alone.

39:50.360 --> 39:53.320
Whoa, whoa!
Where you going there, like?

39:54.840 --> 39:58.720
I take Chloe upstairs because
I know it's gonna wind Scott up.

39:58.800 --> 40:02.840
If them two are bucking, they can
go in the shag pad, not up there.

40:13.040 --> 40:15.320
'Surprise, surprise, up comes Scott.'

40:15.400 --> 40:17.440
That little trick worked a treat.

40:20.320 --> 40:23.120
I can see Scott's
getting really frustrated.

40:23.200 --> 40:25.720
You shouldn't have kissed
Charlotte then.

40:30.440 --> 40:34.120
He doesn't want her, but he doesn't
want anyone else to have her.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.600
Who the fuck
does Chloe think she is?

40:38.680 --> 40:42.520
Me, trying to graft everyone
in the house? Get yourself to bed.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.960
Aaron, so listen.
I'm listening, man.

40:46.640 --> 40:48.440
(laughs)

40:48.520 --> 40:51.520
I love the way you butter bread.
(laughs)

40:57.120 --> 40:59.160
Come here, Aaron! Come here, Aaron.

41:00.400 --> 41:02.640
Aaron, you look
so good looking tonight.

41:04.560 --> 41:07.680
You look so good looking, babe.
Like, oh, my God.Cheers.

41:07.760 --> 41:09.000
Chloe...

41:13.320 --> 41:14.560
Hook, line and sinker.

41:14.640 --> 41:17.760
Sorry, Scott, that's what
it feels like to be mugged off.

41:17.840 --> 41:19.760
What a great end to a great night.

41:19.960 --> 41:20.160
.
