00:15.964 --> 00:17.866
Welcome back to the progrum.

00:17.899 --> 00:21.302
Shiver me timbers, Toolesy.
We've got a ship on the horizon.

00:21.336 --> 00:23.271
Ay‐yay, Cap'n.
And not just any ship

00:23.304 --> 00:27.442
The Canadian National Senior
Hockey Champion... ship.

00:27.475 --> 00:28.710
Yarrr.

00:28.744 --> 00:30.846
Provincial winners from nine
provinces and three territories

00:30.879 --> 00:33.548
will be represented at
the tournament here in Ontario

00:33.581 --> 00:36.551
with the Kerry County Eagles
serving as hosts.

00:36.584 --> 00:38.854
Now, we, of course, are aware
that there are ten provinces

00:38.887 --> 00:40.956
and three territories in Canada.

00:40.989 --> 00:43.224
Nova Scotia will not be
represented this year

00:43.258 --> 00:45.360
as they are serving a one year
ban from the festivities

00:45.393 --> 00:47.262
as a result of a
drunken off‐ice incident

00:47.295 --> 00:48.730
at last year's tournament.

00:48.764 --> 00:50.899
At an old folks home,
of all places.

00:50.932 --> 00:52.000
And on Family Day.

00:52.033 --> 00:54.870
Yup. The good folks of
Nova Scotia have been known

00:54.903 --> 00:57.505
to enjoy the occasional
rum and coke.

00:57.538 --> 00:58.606
(IN LOW VOICE) Yeah.

00:58.640 --> 01:01.276
Could say they brought
Captain Morgan to the ship.

01:01.309 --> 01:02.177
Okay. Okay.

01:02.210 --> 01:05.546
Yo‐ho‐ho and a bottle of rum,
amirite?

01:05.580 --> 01:07.883
The story of the tournament has
really been the shutdown line

01:07.916 --> 01:09.584
for the host
Kerry County Eagles.

01:09.617 --> 01:11.386
A trio from Letterkenny,
Ontario.

01:11.419 --> 01:12.453
Letterkenny?

01:12.487 --> 01:13.889
That's what I said, Toolesy.

01:13.922 --> 01:15.791
'Bout time something good
came out of there.

01:15.824 --> 01:17.425
We'll now take you
live to the event

01:17.458 --> 01:19.527
where our very own Kate Beirness
and Tessa Bonhomme

01:19.560 --> 01:22.230
are covering the tournament
for TSN. Kate and Tessa.

01:22.263 --> 01:24.399
Thanks very much, Jay.
We've got two here.

01:24.432 --> 01:25.834
Where's the third?

01:25.867 --> 01:27.568
Yeah, I wouldn't worry
about him, Kate. (CLEARS THROAT)

01:27.602 --> 01:29.570
He's probably stretching.

01:30.739 --> 01:33.241
(IN LOW VOICE) Who's that?
The mic's didn't get that.

01:33.274 --> 01:34.943
Boys, you're a perfect two
and oh throughout the tournament

01:34.976 --> 01:38.446
having defeated Nunavut
and Northwest Territories.

01:38.479 --> 01:40.548
SHORESY: Northwest terribles.

01:40.581 --> 01:42.583
Your line has combined
for nine goals

01:42.617 --> 01:45.921
allowing none making you
a combined plus 25.

01:45.954 --> 01:48.323
What's been your focus through
these two statement games?

01:48.356 --> 01:50.258
Yeah, Tessa, the number one rule
of playoff hockey is

01:50.291 --> 01:51.827
don't get too high,
don't get too low.

01:51.860 --> 01:52.894
SHORESY: You're making
a fool of yourself,

01:52.928 --> 01:54.896
you fucking labradoodle.

01:56.364 --> 01:57.933
Yeah, it's a team game
out there.

01:57.966 --> 02:01.369
We jumped on a train that was
already rolling down the tracks.

02:01.402 --> 02:02.971
Uh, we're just happy to be here

02:03.004 --> 02:05.774
and contribute and keep
the momentum going.

02:05.807 --> 02:09.310
SHORESY: Jonesy, you are
such a fucking puggle.

02:09.344 --> 02:12.881
Well, good luck tonight
against British Columbia, boys.

02:12.914 --> 02:13.982

02:18.419 --> 02:20.922

Francois Jacques‐Jean.

02:20.956 --> 02:23.825
Known by teammates
as JJ Frankie JJ.

02:23.859 --> 02:25.961
The ex‐pro leads the tournament
with a remarkable

02:25.994 --> 02:28.363
twelve tucks
in two convincing wins

02:28.396 --> 02:30.666
over New Brunswick
and Saskatchewan respectively.

02:30.699 --> 02:32.668
I'm sorry, Jay,
did you say Saskatchewan?

02:32.701 --> 02:33.769
Can confirm.

02:33.802 --> 02:36.504
Remind me, Jay. What's
the capital of Saskatchewan?

02:36.537 --> 02:37.639

Yeah, we weren't really allowed
to watch TV growing up

05:44.559 --> 05:45.861
so we used to
sneak to Uncle Eddie's

09:37.959 --> 09:39.427
MISS FIRE: I'm warning you.

Oh, yeah.

10:05.286 --> 10:06.855
Guys, we gotta get him
outta there.

10:06.888 --> 10:07.923
It's been two months

10:07.956 --> 10:10.125
and he only comes back to chore
and run the dogs.

10:10.158 --> 10:11.960
How we gonna fuck this pig?

10:11.993 --> 10:13.929
They say the grieving process
is very important,

10:13.962 --> 10:15.096
we shouldn't rush it

10:15.130 --> 10:16.865
Well, maybe he just needs
a little bit of encouragement.

10:16.898 --> 10:18.266
(IN LOW VOICE) I'll give him
some encouragement.

10:18.299 --> 10:21.302
The most important step
in getting over heartbreak

10:21.336 --> 10:22.971
is getting excited
to be single again.

10:23.004 --> 10:24.840
(IN LOW VOICE)
I'll get him excited.

10:24.873 --> 10:26.274
Maybe we should give
Rosie a calls?

10:26.307 --> 10:28.176
Maybe give that one
a little time.

10:28.209 --> 10:29.210
She'll be here
when she wants to.

10:29.244 --> 10:31.512
It's just, I kinda feel
like a tit, you know,

10:31.546 --> 10:33.481
my good buddy's down in a hole,

10:33.514 --> 10:35.483
and I'm just sitting here.
I feel useless.

10:35.516 --> 10:36.785
Yeah, samezies.

10:38.854 --> 10:40.922
Remember that scene
in Homeward Bound?

10:40.956 --> 10:43.224
When that old golden retriever
falls down that big hole?

10:43.258 --> 10:45.226
‐Oh, Dary.
‐His name is Shadow.

‐Samezies.

10:48.897 --> 10:50.932

‐Fox and the hound, too

10:52.868 --> 10:54.135
That's a fucking masterpiece.

10:54.169 --> 10:55.871
What did that young
American bulldog do

10:55.904 --> 10:57.005
‐Oh.
‐when his buddy

10:57.038 --> 10:58.139
was down in that big hole.

10:58.173 --> 11:00.141
‐His name was Chance.
‐What did he do?

11:00.175 --> 11:03.344
He got right down in there
with him! That's what he did!

11:03.378 --> 11:05.413
He saw his buddy
down in that hole!

11:05.446 --> 11:06.547
Down in the muck!

11:06.581 --> 11:08.249
And he got right down
in there with him.

11:08.283 --> 11:10.385
Yeah. He didn't let him
be down there by himself.

11:10.418 --> 11:12.387
‐Cold and alone.
‐Oh, hell no!

11:12.420 --> 11:14.222
He got right down
in there with him!

11:14.255 --> 11:15.924
Let's go, Dary.

11:22.097 --> 11:23.131
Wait. Should we get
some Puppers?

11:23.164 --> 11:24.866
Oh, yeah. We should
definitely get some Puppers.

a lot of chit‐chat

11:44.653 --> 11:46.087
between the whistles.

11:46.121 --> 11:48.990
Yeah, Kate. A ton of chit‐chat.

11:49.024 --> 11:52.994
So much that it's hard to tell
if they're buddies

11:53.028 --> 11:54.595

11:54.630 --> 11:55.964

Fousty groupa CFA's, I'd say.

17:50.952 --> 17:52.620
Right fousty groupa come

18:08.904 --> 18:10.505

18:12.974 --> 18:15.543

If it's all hands you want,

18:18.046 --> 18:20.315
All hands throwin' hands, Tommy.

18:26.755 --> 18:28.690
Fire up a scoff, I'm gutfounded.

18:28.724 --> 18:30.558
Scoffs till we're stogged,
Teddy.

18:30.591 --> 18:32.794
But first she's these skeets.

18:32.828 --> 18:34.830
First she's these sooks then
we go on in out of it.

18:34.863 --> 18:35.897
Let's have a time.

18:35.931 --> 18:37.365

18:43.304 --> 18:44.673
Back to fucking Newfieland.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.574
Oh, now, don't go
mentionin' home.

18:46.607 --> 18:48.977
Gives me warm and tinglies
and all this.

18:49.010 --> 18:50.746
Gives me the warmest fuzzies

18:50.779 --> 18:52.413

talk of Newfoundland.

18:52.447 --> 18:54.683
I'll have a tear broadside
the eye for the effort.

18:54.716 --> 18:55.917
Parked a tear rig handy.

18:55.951 --> 18:57.653
Fuck, Teddy, Knows.

18:57.686 --> 18:59.420

19:08.930 --> 19:09.965
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

19:09.998 --> 19:11.566
Holy fuck.

19:14.502 --> 19:16.037
REILLY: Yeah, and most people
actually don't know this

19:16.071 --> 19:18.439
but they speak a different
language in Newfoundland.

19:18.473 --> 19:19.641
JONESY: There was no sense
chirping them

19:19.675 --> 19:20.876
'cause they don't know English

19:20.909 --> 19:22.778
and we don't know
how to speak, uh...

19:23.544 --> 19:24.680
REILLY: Newfish.

19:24.713 --> 19:26.715
Thanks buddy, and we don't know
how to speak Newfish.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.583
But we'll learn
because you know really,

19:28.616 --> 19:31.019
all Canadians should speak
all three official languages.

19:31.052 --> 19:32.087
For sure, bro.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.355
That's why we focused on
the game and spanked them.

19:34.389 --> 19:35.523
Onto the final!

19:35.556 --> 19:36.658
Love it, boys.

19:36.692 --> 19:38.694
Yeah, we wanna hear

19:38.727 --> 19:39.995
Just save it for the fire.

19:41.129 --> 19:42.597
‐How'r ya now?
‐BOTH: Good.

19:42.631 --> 19:44.432

19:44.465 --> 19:45.801
‐Good'n you?
‐Not s'bad.

19:45.834 --> 19:47.368
All right, boys. Spill it.

19:47.402 --> 19:48.970
Give us the game plan
for the big final.

19:49.004 --> 19:50.639
‐BOTH: Okay.
‐But,

19:50.672 --> 19:51.873

19:51.907 --> 19:54.542
Kate Beirness and Tessa Bonhomme

19:55.410 --> 19:56.544
You're celebrities now.

19:56.577 --> 19:57.679
Are you seri‐dog?

19:57.713 --> 20:00.115
You're on the biggest stage in
Canadian sports, boys.

20:00.148 --> 20:01.783
TS fucking N.

20:02.517 --> 20:03.584
She's seri‐dog.

20:03.618 --> 20:04.653
What's all this then?

20:04.686 --> 20:05.821
Hang tight.

20:05.854 --> 20:08.690
Boys, what's the focus going
into tomorrow night's bout

20:08.724 --> 20:10.659

20:10.692 --> 20:11.893
(CLEARS THROAT)

20:11.927 --> 20:13.962
‐Well...
‐Make sure to project.

20:13.995 --> 20:15.096
Let's see some excitement.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.732
Yeah. Let's hear
the passion, boys!

20:18.133 --> 20:19.768
Okay, um...

20:19.801 --> 20:21.737
Well, we've gotta have all
four lines bangin' out there.

20:21.770 --> 20:22.904
We gotta do
the little things right.

20:22.938 --> 20:24.706
Uh, make sure we're taking
short shifts,

20:24.740 --> 20:26.507
‐thirty seconds hard and off.
‐That's it?

20:26.541 --> 20:27.508
And you gotta keep
it simple out there.

20:27.542 --> 20:29.144
Do the little things right.
Fire a few howies

20:29.177 --> 20:30.846
around the tendies ears early
to get him rattled

20:30.879 --> 20:32.814
and establish a net front
presence till the final horn.

20:32.848 --> 20:34.716
Okay.
This time really go for it.

20:35.116 --> 20:36.117
Okay, uh.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.919
We gotta make sure
we're playing for the crest

20:37.953 --> 20:38.854
on the front of out sweaters

20:38.887 --> 20:39.921
and out brothers beside us
on the bench.

20:39.955 --> 20:41.857
We're gonna go out there
and we're gonna make sure

20:41.890 --> 20:43.391
we're bringing the ship home
with 18 of our brothers.

20:43.424 --> 20:45.126
Battles and wars, boys.
Blood, sweat and tears.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.728
One final tour of duty,
guns loaded,

20:46.762 --> 20:47.996
in the trenches,
marching

20:48.029 --> 20:49.564
shoulder to shoulder
with our brothers.

20:49.597 --> 20:50.565
No good man left behind.

20:50.598 --> 20:52.533
‐For us, for each other.
‐For the brotherhood.

20:52.567 --> 20:54.002
For our country!
For Newfoundland!

20:54.035 --> 20:55.603
Death before surrender!

20:59.607 --> 21:00.608
We gonna fuck this pig?

21:01.176 --> 21:02.410
K.

You fucking fruit snackers.

21:04.112 --> 21:05.246
You fucking tea towler.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.181
Squirrelly, go ahead and take
a couple steps towards him

21:06.214 --> 21:07.849
and don't be surprised
if all of a sudden

21:07.883 --> 21:08.917
he's got some place to be.

21:08.950 --> 21:11.119
‐Who put a nickel in you?
‐You're a dilly bar, bud.

21:11.152 --> 21:13.188
‐Fucking bowl filler.
‐You're a fucking day old.

21:13.221 --> 21:14.622
You are fucking average.

21:14.656 --> 21:15.857
Were yous in a pretty tough

21:15.891 --> 21:17.425
car accident at one point
or something?

21:17.458 --> 21:18.960
You think you're playin'
for the Toronto Maple Leafs?

21:18.994 --> 21:20.729
You're playing for the
Toronto Maple Queefs.

21:20.762 --> 21:22.831
You're a fucking noodle,
and you look like a goose.

21:22.864 --> 21:24.800
‐Know the TSN turning point?
‐Yeah.

21:24.833 --> 21:27.035
Yous are TSN

21:27.068 --> 21:28.737
You're a bunch of
fucking mis‐plays.

21:28.770 --> 21:29.905
You're the Motrin
pain of the day

21:29.938 --> 21:31.572
and the Pepto‐Bismol
upset of the week.

21:31.606 --> 21:33.742
‐Fucking novice.
‐And all this brotherhood talks

21:33.775 --> 21:36.477
gotta stop when it's uncertain
yous don't suck each other off.

21:36.511 --> 21:37.779
You giving his flute
a little toot?

21:37.813 --> 21:39.214
I think he'd give
his flute a big hoot.

21:39.247 --> 21:40.849
DARYL: Big ol' mouth full
of bell end.

21:40.882 --> 21:42.617
You are so fucking 5'11".
