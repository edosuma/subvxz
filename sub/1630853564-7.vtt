00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
This programme contains strong and
frequent language from the outset.

00:11.160 --> 00:14.320
You can't turn back time
to stop what happened to Sarah.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.000
And are you willing to burn down
everything to start again? Yes.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.440
And are you willing to burn down
everything to start again? Yes.

00:18.480 --> 00:24.000
A nuclear warhead
nicknamed Big Boy was hijacked.

00:24.000 --> 00:24.760
A nuclear warhead
nicknamed Big Boy was hijacked.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.720
The key's the detonator.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.640
You worked out where Big Boy is.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.000
It's Janet,
he's been sending money to her.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.800
It's Janet,
he's been sending money to her.

00:33.840 --> 00:37.840
Shiv would never betray The Lazarus.
I used to say that about Rebrov.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.960
Multiple missile strikes. Troops
have moved across the border.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.960
They are resetting the clock.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Now there are two things.
We lose Rebrov. Second thing, Shiv.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.040
Now there are two things.
We lose Rebrov. Second thing, Shiv.

01:31.120 --> 01:33.200
I'm gonna bring her back, Shiv.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.000
I'm gonna bring you back too.

01:36.000 --> 01:36.560
I'm gonna bring you back too.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.520
The first thing
I'm gonna do is come for you.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.360
I know.

01:46.120 --> 01:49.760
Son of a bitch.

01:51.720 --> 01:52.000
Oh!

01:52.000 --> 01:55.600
Oh!

02:19.200 --> 02:23.400
Er, I'm... I'm sorry,
I need... I need to run.

02:23.440 --> 02:24.000
You have to leave now? Right now?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.720
You have to leave now? Right now?

02:25.760 --> 02:27.760
Yeah, I know it's imperfect timing.
I'd say.

02:36.480 --> 02:38.440
You're acting really weird.

02:38.480 --> 02:40.000
I just really want
to be here with you, right now.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.520
I just really want
to be here with you, right now.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.440
I want that so much.
And I'm gonna come back

02:45.480 --> 02:48.000
and I'm gonna kiss you
and I'm never gonna let you go.

02:48.000 --> 02:48.640
and I'm gonna kiss you
and I'm never gonna let you go.

02:48.680 --> 02:52.880
I promise. I'm probably
going to wank and go to sleep.

02:52.920 --> 02:55.240
Yeah, no, that's understandable.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.800
I told you I'd bring you back.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.000
And I told you I'd come for you.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.640
And I told you I'd come for you.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.200
So, what's the plan now, George?

03:44.360 --> 03:47.280
Are you gonna shoot me again?
Nah, man, that's not me.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.880
Everyone I ever killed
just came back to life.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.000
I'd like to keep it that way. How do
you think you'll get away with this?

03:52.000 --> 03:52.840
I'd like to keep it that way. How do
you think you'll get away with this?

03:52.880 --> 03:56.720
Shiv, I already did. Everyone thinks
you're the one who let off Big Boy.

03:56.760 --> 04:00.000
Ha! Well, I'm happy
to let them know it was you.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.200
Ha! Well, I'm happy
to let them know it was you.

04:01.240 --> 04:05.560
What the new guy? The app developer?
No. No-one's gonna believe that.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.000
The woman you love
just came back from the dead.

04:08.000 --> 04:08.080
The woman you love
just came back from the dead.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.480
That's a pretty big fucking motive.
Yeah, what about the woman you love?

04:11.520 --> 04:13.320
I met Janet.

04:19.480 --> 04:21.720
You send her money.

04:21.760 --> 04:24.000
Look out for her and the kid.
She's my friend.

04:24.000 --> 04:24.440
Look out for her and the kid.
She's my friend.

04:24.480 --> 04:28.480
And you ruined her life.
Now you owe her.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.680
And why would we want
to set off a nuclear bomb?

04:31.720 --> 04:32.000
Maybe something
happened to her daughter.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.880
Maybe something
happened to her daughter.

04:34.880 --> 04:38.360
Maybe right after the checkpoint,
just like Sarah. Fuck me, man.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.000
She already lost
one kid because of you.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.160
She already lost
one kid because of you.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.600
What were you supposed to do,
just let the other one die too?

04:47.120 --> 04:48.000
That's bullshit.
No. It's motive.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.800
That's bullshit.
No. It's motive.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.000
Fuck you, George. I just wanted
to save my girlfriend's life.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.120
Fuck you, George. I just wanted
to save my girlfriend's life.

04:57.160 --> 04:59.280
You had to be an arsehole about it.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.680
Grow up, you stupid prick.
Oh, fuck off! No, you fuck off,

05:01.720 --> 05:04.000
you fucking dickhead. I'm a
dickhead? You're a fucking dickhead.

05:04.000 --> 05:04.560
you fucking dickhead. I'm a
dickhead? You're a fucking dickhead.

05:06.120 --> 05:10.280
Look, I'm sorry,
No. Don't fucking apologise to me.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.000
Shiv, what are you fighting for
here? You don't even want this.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Shiv, what are you fighting for
here? You don't even want this.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.080
Look at what Lazarus
has done to you.

05:16.120 --> 05:20.000
Janet was happy. She'd made a little
life for herself and it worked.

05:20.000 --> 05:20.480
Janet was happy. She'd made a little
life for herself and it worked.

05:20.520 --> 05:24.040
You could have that too.
I could fucking shoot you.

05:25.080 --> 05:27.880
That's hardly gonna
make you look less guilty.

05:30.280 --> 05:32.280
Everyone's on their
way here now, Shiv.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.640
You know how this ends.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.280
What was it like?

05:44.280 --> 05:46.960
Getting everything
you wanted back again?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Worth it.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.000
Yeah. Yeah, well...

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Yeah. Yeah, well...

05:54.800 --> 05:56.800
..we'll see.

07:03.640 --> 07:04.000
Hey. Is this an apology hug
for running out on me last night?

07:04.000 --> 07:07.520
Hey. Is this an apology hug
for running out on me last night?

07:07.560 --> 07:11.920
No, more than that. Well,
I forgive you. Where did you go?

07:11.960 --> 07:12.000
Er, I had, like, a work call
that I completely forgot about.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.680
Er, I had, like, a work call
that I completely forgot about.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.000
They called you
at midnight on your day off?

07:18.040 --> 07:20.000
Er, yeah.

07:20.000 --> 07:20.040
Er, yeah.

07:20.080 --> 07:23.200
Shit, I forgot it's my day off.
Your boss treats you like shit.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.400
I'm self-employed.
I know.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.880
Hi, miss. Hey, miss.
Morning!

07:30.920 --> 07:33.200
Ah, shit, babe.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.160
I need to talk to Karl.
About what?

07:35.200 --> 07:36.000
A fucking investment thing.
Just wait here for a second.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.800
A fucking investment thing.
Just wait here for a second.

07:39.440 --> 07:43.840
Oh! And watch the road. Trucks will
be coming up and down here. OK, Dad.

07:43.880 --> 07:44.000
Oh, Karl, look, before
you say anything, listen.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.720
Oh, Karl, look, before
you say anything, listen.

07:47.760 --> 07:52.000
Looked at my portfolio last night
and I saw DeWhitt and Weston tanked

07:52.000 --> 07:52.040
Looked at my portfolio last night
and I saw DeWhitt and Weston tanked

07:52.080 --> 07:54.440
and you don't need to panic.
I moved some shares around,

07:54.480 --> 07:57.760
I've secured your investment. You
don't need to worry about a thing.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.880
Are you sure?
Yeah, man, sure as can be.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.960
Look, you're in safe hands,
man, I got you.

08:07.840 --> 08:08.000
Oh, wow. OK.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.960
Oh, wow. OK.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.640
Thank you, man.
I was... I was pretty worried.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.720
Ah, no, look, sometimes
you've gotta take a risk

08:15.760 --> 08:16.000
but there's always a safety net.
Yeah.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.680
but there's always a safety net.
Yeah.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.360
All right. I'll see you later, man.
See you, man.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.000
Is he OK?
Yeah.

08:24.000 --> 08:24.880
Is he OK?
Yeah.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.040
Woooooh!

08:28.080 --> 08:30.760
I'll be hearing about that
for the next six months. Sorry.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.000
It's OK. Let's make it a year.

08:32.000 --> 08:32.800
It's OK. Let's make it a year.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.200
Ooooh!

08:36.160 --> 08:38.200
Oh! Come on, go inside

08:49.320 --> 08:51.680
Oh, you're grinning like an idiot,
please stop it.

08:51.720 --> 08:53.880
Sorry.
It's disgusting.

08:53.920 --> 08:56.000
Maybe you just need to get some.
Don't make me report you to HR.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.240
Maybe you just need to get some.
Don't make me report you to HR.

08:57.280 --> 09:00.160
Do we have an HR department?
We did but I fucked them all.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.200
How's Sarah?

09:02.240 --> 09:04.000
Yeah, she keeps asking me why
I'm hugging her all the time.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.680
Yeah, she keeps asking me why
I'm hugging her all the time.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.960
That poor woman.
She's good, she's...

09:08.000 --> 09:11.560
Not squashed under a truck?
Not squashed under a truck, yeah.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.000
That's it, that's exactly
how she is. Long may it continue.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.920
That's it, that's exactly
how she is. Long may it continue.

09:17.720 --> 09:20.000
Um, did you...
did you manage to talk to Ryan?

09:20.000 --> 09:20.360
Um, did you...
did you manage to talk to Ryan?

09:20.400 --> 09:22.960
Dead Ryan, the IT guy? Yeah.

09:23.960 --> 09:27.800
And?
And your story checked out.

09:27.840 --> 09:28.000
It was all Shiv.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.760
It was all Shiv.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.960
It wasn't a story.
Yeah, no, I didn't mean that.

09:37.440 --> 09:40.840
So, do you think
we're gonna find him or...?

09:41.880 --> 09:44.000
Shiv? Yeah.
If he doesn't wanna be found,

09:44.000 --> 09:45.040
Shiv? Yeah.
If he doesn't wanna be found,

09:45.080 --> 09:48.320
he won't get found. Rebrov didn't
want to be found and we found him.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.280
I'm not so sure
Rebrov didn't want that.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.000
You think he just let us catch him
on purpose? Why would he do that?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.360
You think he just let us catch him
on purpose? Why would he do that?

09:53.400 --> 09:55.880
To get a look at us.
To check out our weaknesses.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.640
Honestly, I don't know what
he knows now that he didn't before

09:58.680 --> 10:00.000
but I do know he's more
dangerous than he ever was. Right.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
but I do know he's more
dangerous than he ever was. Right.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.400
I hadn't...
I hadn't actually considered that.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.440
Yeah, it's just a theory.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.200
Hello!

10:15.240 --> 10:16.000
How was work?

10:16.000 --> 10:17.440
How was work?

10:18.440 --> 10:22.080
Fine. One of my year fours
tried to put a crayon up his bum,

10:22.120 --> 10:24.000
so that took up
most of the afternoon.

10:24.000 --> 10:24.040
so that took up
most of the afternoon.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.880
Oh, yeah, are we not
supposed to do that?

10:25.920 --> 10:28.560
You're a grown man, George, you
can put whatever you want up there.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.600
OK.

10:30.640 --> 10:32.000
I'm meeting Tash and Susie at
the pub later. Oh, cool. I'll come.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.120
I'm meeting Tash and Susie at
the pub later. Oh, cool. I'll come.

10:34.160 --> 10:37.000
Yeah? If you want.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
We're just gonna be
talking about work mostly.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.800
You'll probably be bored.
I don't mind. OK.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.440
..five months.
OK, OK.

11:03.840 --> 11:04.000
Babe, er,
I think I'm gonna head off.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.800
Babe, er,
I think I'm gonna head off.

11:06.840 --> 11:11.800
What? Already? Yeah, er,
I've got a banging headache.

11:11.840 --> 11:12.000
Oh, no. Do you...?
Do you want to come with?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.520
Oh, no. Do you...?
Do you want to come with?

11:14.560 --> 11:17.800
No, I'm gonna stay for a bit.
I won't be too late.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.840
All right.

11:19.880 --> 11:20.000
I'll see...

11:20.000 --> 11:21.840
I'll see...

11:21.880 --> 11:24.880
I'll see you later. Bye.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.920
Bye!
Bye!

11:28.560 --> 11:31.360
Is he all right?
Yeah. I think so.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.840
Do you wanna get smashed?
Yeah!

11:39.720 --> 11:41.720
Teams, get into position.

11:43.640 --> 11:44.000
Try and take Rebrov alive.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.640
Try and take Rebrov alive.

11:45.680 --> 11:47.680
Roger that. Approaching.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.440
Oscar three-six, sit rep.

12:37.680 --> 12:40.000
Ugh! Argh!

12:40.000 --> 12:40.160
Ugh! Argh!

13:05.000 --> 13:07.160
He didn't need to be there.
What do you mean?

13:07.200 --> 13:09.200
He knew we'd send a team after him.

13:09.240 --> 13:12.000
He waited there
so he could kill them. Why?

13:12.000 --> 13:12.320
He waited there
so he could kill them. Why?

13:12.360 --> 13:14.320
To let us know he could.

13:15.840 --> 13:18.920
What about Shiv?
Trail's cold... for now.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.000
These cases don't close.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.640
These cases don't close.

13:21.680 --> 13:24.560
We never stop looking.

14:00.360 --> 14:03.120
Are you going anywhere this summer?

14:03.160 --> 14:06.440
You know where I was thinking
I haven't been in years? Paris.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.000
Oh, it's so easy to get to.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.120
Oh, it's so easy to get to.

14:09.160 --> 14:12.600
City of romance, George.
Someone's angling for something.

14:12.640 --> 14:16.000
Wow, but Paris? I don't
know. I haven't been there since...

14:16.000 --> 14:18.160
Wow, but Paris? I don't
know. I haven't been there since...

14:19.240 --> 14:21.120
A while ago.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.000
The Eurostar's
the best way of getting there.

14:24.000 --> 14:24.280
The Eurostar's
the best way of getting there.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.320
Don't fly, honestly.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.680
I wish I could have a cigarette.

14:55.720 --> 14:56.000
What, you used to smoke?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.720
What, you used to smoke?

14:57.760 --> 14:59.800
In university,
I used to smoke Silk Cut menthols

14:59.840 --> 15:01.720
and think I was Greta Garbo.

15:01.760 --> 15:03.760
I didn't know that about you.

15:03.800 --> 15:04.000
You didn't know I used
to smoke Silk Cut menthols

15:04.000 --> 15:05.760
You didn't know I used
to smoke Silk Cut menthols

15:05.800 --> 15:08.160
and think I looked like Greta Garbo?
No. Huh.

15:09.160 --> 15:12.000
Why'd you quit? Er, well,
it turned out I did not in fact

15:12.000 --> 15:12.560
Why'd you quit? Er, well,
it turned out I did not in fact

15:12.600 --> 15:14.840
look like Greta Garbo.
I looked like my aunt Pat.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.240
And I smelt like her too.

15:17.280 --> 15:19.560
But I want one now.

15:19.600 --> 15:20.000
Must be Paris.
Mm! I could smoke a cheroot.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.240
Must be Paris.
Mm! I could smoke a cheroot.

15:23.280 --> 15:26.280
Do you wanna do that? Do you wanna
go buy a packet of cigarettes

15:26.320 --> 15:28.000
and smoke 'em by the river?
We could do a runner from here.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.040
and smoke 'em by the river?
We could do a runner from here.

15:29.080 --> 15:33.600
What, without paying? Well, it's
not doing a runner if you pay,

15:33.640 --> 15:35.640
it's just leaving promptly.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.400
Er, I was kind of looking
forward to my dessert.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.560
Yeah, OK.
Mmm!

15:43.600 --> 15:44.000
Smoke cheroots,
do runnings from restaurants.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.560
Smoke cheroots,
do runnings from restaurants.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.680
Who are you and what have
you done with my girlfriend?

15:49.760 --> 15:52.000
Monsieur, madame, vous avez termine?

15:52.000 --> 15:52.040
Monsieur, madame, vous avez termine?

15:52.080 --> 15:54.600
Oui.
Oh, yeah, very termine.

15:55.760 --> 15:57.760
Merci.
Merci.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.000
Great accent. You want some? Thank
you, I know. Yes, yes. Thanks.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.240
Great accent. You want some? Thank
you, I know. Yes, yes. Thanks.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.000
Do you think I'm exciting?
Er, yeah.

16:08.000 --> 16:08.800
Do you think I'm exciting?
Er, yeah.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.840
I think you're really exciting.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.760
No, I'm not, am I? I used to be.

16:12.800 --> 16:16.000
I mean, maybe... maybe you grew up?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.120
I mean, maybe... maybe you grew up?

16:19.600 --> 16:21.920
Do you remember when we first met?

16:21.960 --> 16:23.880
Yeah.

16:23.920 --> 16:24.000
It feels like a million years ago.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.920
It feels like a million years ago.

16:26.920 --> 16:31.840
I wonder if I met myself back then
if I'd even recognise myself.

16:31.880 --> 16:32.000
I wonder what old me
would think of me now.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.720
I wonder what old me
would think of me now.

16:34.760 --> 16:38.320
There's nothing wrong with you.
I know. I'm great.

16:39.640 --> 16:40.000
Ugh! Thank you.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.160
Ugh! Thank you.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.120
Oh, are you sure
you don't want some?

16:45.600 --> 16:48.000
I'm full.
It looks delicious, though.

16:48.000 --> 16:48.600
I'm full.
It looks delicious, though.

16:48.640 --> 16:49.800
Yeah.

16:52.160 --> 16:54.160
Sorry, I'm just gonna go to the loo.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.880
What do you remember
from the night we met?

17:00.920 --> 17:03.280
I remember you following me
to the bus stop like a creep.

17:03.320 --> 17:04.000
Ah, I did not follow you!

17:04.000 --> 17:05.720
Ah, I did not follow you!

17:05.760 --> 17:07.760
I don't even remember
whose party it was.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.800
I was actually there
for someone else.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.000
What?
Yeah. I had a friend who I fancied

17:12.000 --> 17:13.720
What?
Yeah. I had a friend who I fancied

17:13.760 --> 17:15.760
who I was planning on
getting off with that night

17:15.800 --> 17:18.920
Oh.
Oh, I did not know that.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.000
Another thing you don't know.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.360
Another thing you don't know.

17:23.120 --> 17:26.240
So what, you just,
you just went to this party

17:26.280 --> 17:28.000
wanting to get off with
this guy and...? And I met you.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.640
wanting to get off with
this guy and...? And I met you.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.040
Yeah.
And I'm glad I did.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.720
I'm glad we came here.

17:37.200 --> 17:41.000
What if instead of going home
tomorrow we went somewhere else?

17:41.040 --> 17:43.040
Like where?

17:43.080 --> 17:44.000
Er, I don't know. Anywhere.
We could get the train

17:44.000 --> 17:45.320
Er, I don't know. Anywhere.
We could get the train

17:45.360 --> 17:48.560
to, like, Russia
or Israel or Thailand.

17:48.600 --> 17:52.000
Er, I don't think you can
get a train to Thailand.

17:52.000 --> 17:52.280
Er, I don't think you can
get a train to Thailand.

17:53.280 --> 17:57.800
I just think we should go to
more places and take more risks.

17:57.840 --> 18:00.000
Is this because
I made us pay for dinner? No.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.520
Is this because
I made us pay for dinner? No.

18:01.560 --> 18:06.000
I just... I don't know,
I don't wanna stagnate.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.880
Do the same job, be the same person.

18:10.920 --> 18:14.320
Like, I need to do more living.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.000
Go on adventures.
Do you know what I mean?

18:16.000 --> 18:16.920
Go on adventures.
Do you know what I mean?

18:16.960 --> 18:20.920
Yeah. I mean I did just
eat a very big creme brulee,

18:20.960 --> 18:24.000
so I think I know a little
about living life adventurously.

18:24.000 --> 18:24.080
so I think I know a little
about living life adventurously.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.720
Marry me.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.000
What?

18:40.000 --> 18:40.760
What?

18:40.800 --> 18:43.040
I want you to marry me.

18:44.040 --> 18:47.040
And if you're going on adventures...

18:48.920 --> 18:52.160
..I want you to take me with you.
Marry me.

18:55.760 --> 18:56.000
OK. OK?
OK.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.240
OK. OK?
OK.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.400
Hi, there.

19:33.280 --> 19:35.280
I can't marry you, George.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.560
I love you, I really do

19:41.600 --> 19:44.000
but lately I've been thinking.

19:44.000 --> 19:44.040
but lately I've been thinking.

19:44.080 --> 19:47.840
I've been wondering about us

19:47.880 --> 19:52.000
and I don't know
if I'm happy really.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.680
and I don't know
if I'm happy really.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.960
Not in the way a person should be.

19:57.960 --> 20:00.000
And it's not just you, it's not,
because you're great.

20:00.000 --> 20:00.920
And it's not just you, it's not,
because you're great.

20:00.960 --> 20:04.040
Great's such a shit word,
I'm sorry but you are.

20:04.080 --> 20:08.000
And I kept thinking maybe it's me
and it's a phase and it will pass

20:08.000 --> 20:09.080
And I kept thinking maybe it's me
and it's a phase and it will pass

20:09.120 --> 20:12.960
and maybe it will but then
you asked me to marry you.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.440
And I just had this
voice in my head,

20:15.480 --> 20:16.000
this fucking foghorn going off,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.960
this fucking foghorn going off,

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
telling me not to do it.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
And I know I should have
said this to you last night

20:24.000 --> 20:24.360
And I know I should have
said this to you last night

20:24.400 --> 20:27.920
because it's too cruel,
I know, but I can't.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.000
I can't marry you because I don't
think we want the same things.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.240
I can't marry you because I don't
think we want the same things.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.640
I think we're different people now.

20:36.680 --> 20:39.400
You're just so content with
all the things I wanna change.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.720
I'm sorry.

20:50.240 --> 20:53.160
Er, I... I can...

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
I mean, I can do
whatever you need me to. I...

20:56.000 --> 20:57.400
I mean, I can do
whatever you need me to. I...

20:59.560 --> 21:03.160
We can go places. We can...
We can do whatever you want.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.000
I can change things.
I can change everything.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.120
I can change things.
I can change everything.

21:06.160 --> 21:10.440
I don't want you to do that. I don't
want you to break yourself apart

21:10.480 --> 21:12.000
to just re-fit yourself
into something that I need.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.400
to just re-fit yourself
into something that I need.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.000
No, no. I... I...
I am what you need, me and you,

21:17.040 --> 21:19.360
we're what each other needs.
We're...

21:19.400 --> 21:20.000
Fuck it! We're...
We're George and Sarah.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.960
Fuck it! We're...
We're George and Sarah.

21:23.640 --> 21:28.000
We... We met at the party
and we fell in love and we...

21:28.000 --> 21:28.440
We... We met at the party
and we fell in love and we...

21:29.560 --> 21:31.560
It's us.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.000
This doesn't make any sense.
People change.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.840
This doesn't make any sense.
People change.

21:39.360 --> 21:43.440
We just do. I think we both have.

21:43.480 --> 21:44.000
Um...

21:44.000 --> 21:45.480
Um...

21:47.880 --> 21:51.200
Please. Please, please
don't do this. I...

21:52.200 --> 21:54.200
I can't...

21:58.120 --> 22:00.000
We're meant to be together.

22:00.000 --> 22:00.120
We're meant to be together.

22:00.160 --> 22:02.160
I don't think we are,

22:02.200 --> 22:04.000
not forever.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.400
I'll send you
the money for this trip.

22:24.560 --> 22:27.040
Just like that, huh?
Just like that.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.520
Shit.
You're not gonna like this but...

22:30.560 --> 22:32.000
You thought this would happen. It
isn't the first time a relationship

22:32.000 --> 22:33.320
You thought this would happen. It
isn't the first time a relationship

22:33.360 --> 22:35.600
has been destroyed by time loops.
It is not the first time

22:35.640 --> 22:37.720
this relationship has
been destroyed by time loops.

22:37.760 --> 22:39.360
I just thought, after everything...

22:42.320 --> 22:44.400
it's meant to be. It must be.

22:48.640 --> 22:51.320
Assume for a minute I'm the sort of
person who believes in the notion

22:51.360 --> 22:54.080
that something is
"just meant to be."

22:54.120 --> 22:56.000
Maybe she did
come back for a reason.

22:56.000 --> 22:56.280
Maybe she did
come back for a reason.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.520
But maybe, and this might
be hard for you to comprehend,

22:58.560 --> 23:01.720
so gird your loins,
maybe she has some higher purpose

23:01.760 --> 23:03.640
that is actually
nothing to do with you.

23:03.680 --> 23:04.000
There might be some grand cosmic
plan for her that does not bear

23:04.000 --> 23:06.200
There might be some grand cosmic
plan for her that does not bear

23:06.240 --> 23:08.880
any relation to whether or not
she's going out with George Addo.

23:08.920 --> 23:12.000
Women can, and again this is
a radical notion, so hang in there,

23:12.000 --> 23:12.920
Women can, and again this is
a radical notion, so hang in there,

23:12.960 --> 23:16.000
they can have an identity
and a reason for existing

23:16.040 --> 23:18.880
that is completely separate from
who they're in a relationship with.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.000
Sit with that for a little while,
it's a bit of a noodle twister.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.560
Sit with that for a little while,
it's a bit of a noodle twister.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.440
Can't I just mope about
my girlfriend dumping me

23:25.480 --> 23:27.480
without being accused
of internalised misogyny?

23:27.520 --> 23:28.000
Not with me, no. Right, well,
remind me, if you ever get dumped,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.480
Not with me, no. Right, well,
remind me, if you ever get dumped,

23:30.520 --> 23:32.640
to take you to a pub
and make you feel worse.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.720
Well, I won't need
your help for that but OK.

23:42.640 --> 23:44.000
Shiv popped up.

23:44.000 --> 23:44.280
Shiv popped up.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.200
Hamburg.

23:51.320 --> 23:52.000
Doing what? Using his credit card
in a crowded pub with CCTV cameras.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.240
Doing what? Using his credit card
in a crowded pub with CCTV cameras.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.240
I don't understand.

23:57.280 --> 23:59.280
He wants us to know he's there.
Why?

23:59.320 --> 24:00.000
No idea. Not a fucking clue.
Glad he's alive, though.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.640
No idea. Not a fucking clue.
Glad he's alive, though.

24:03.680 --> 24:06.960
Do you, um...? Do you...?
Do you really think he was a mole?

24:08.280 --> 24:10.600
I'm not gonna sit here
and say it's impossible.

24:10.640 --> 24:13.480
If I've learnt a single thing,
it's that any fucking person

24:13.520 --> 24:16.000
is capable of any fucking thing.
Shiv included.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.240
is capable of any fucking thing.
Shiv included.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.880
I will say this, though,
something stinks.

24:24.520 --> 24:27.720
Look, Sarah's alive.
I'm glad about that.

24:27.760 --> 24:30.840
I don't know her. I'm kind of tired
of listening to you talk about her

24:30.880 --> 24:32.000
but I'm glad she's with us.
It's a victory.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.560
but I'm glad she's with us.
It's a victory.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.600
And we don't always get them.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.680
And you won't
feel like this forever.

24:37.720 --> 24:39.640
It just feels like it right now.

25:10.960 --> 25:12.000
"Teachers plant seeds that
grow forever." What the fuck?

25:12.000 --> 25:15.640
"Teachers plant seeds that
grow forever." What the fuck?

25:17.840 --> 25:20.000
Oh, fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck! Fuck, shit.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.800
Oh, fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck! Fuck, shit.

25:43.360 --> 25:44.000
How do you get by?
We manage.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.800
How do you get by?
We manage.

25:45.840 --> 25:48.920
Professional job. At least
one of them came back with links

25:48.960 --> 25:51.040
to a mercenary group
that's been working out east.

25:51.080 --> 25:52.000
Where was it?
Hamburg.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Where was it?
Hamburg.

25:55.760 --> 25:57.520
Oh.

25:58.520 --> 26:00.000
You don't think this could be Shiv?

26:00.000 --> 26:00.640
You don't think this could be Shiv?

26:00.680 --> 26:02.880
That's what you're
gonna go and find out.

26:17.520 --> 26:19.920
No-one saw anything. There
was a camera down the street

26:19.960 --> 26:23.000
but it was disabled.
Interpol are sending someone,

26:23.040 --> 26:24.000
so we have the bodies
on ice at the morgue.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.040
so we have the bodies
on ice at the morgue.

26:25.080 --> 26:27.360
Has anyone else come to see them?

26:27.400 --> 26:29.240
No. Just you and Interpol.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.000
You're MI5, right?

26:32.000 --> 26:32.400
You're MI5, right?

26:32.440 --> 26:34.440
No.

26:34.480 --> 26:37.680
OK. Here we are.

26:37.720 --> 26:39.720
Thanks, mate.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.680
Glass on the inside. Someone smashed
the window and came in this way.

26:52.720 --> 26:55.120
Hmm! Snuck in on them.

27:02.480 --> 27:04.000
This guy closest to the door
was shot seven times in the chest.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.840
This guy closest to the door
was shot seven times in the chest.

27:05.880 --> 27:09.720
Then ones at the far end of the room
are all single shots to the head.

27:15.960 --> 27:17.880
Human shields.

27:17.920 --> 27:20.000
So, what, these guys are all
mercenaries? From what we can tell,

27:20.000 --> 27:20.720
So, what, these guys are all
mercenaries? From what we can tell,

27:20.760 --> 27:22.960
they worked mostly out of
China and the Middle East.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.160
Security jobs. Some nastier stuff.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.000
So, what are they doing
in a garage in a German suburb?

27:28.000 --> 27:28.600
So, what are they doing
in a garage in a German suburb?

27:35.800 --> 27:36.000
Whoever was in this room
fired at whoever was coming in.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.400
Whoever was in this room
fired at whoever was coming in.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.000
Hmm.

27:44.000 --> 27:44.480
Hmm.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.800
They had a hostage.

27:47.840 --> 27:51.160
So, this was a rescue.
Rescue attempt.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.400
They went out this way.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.520
Without the hostage?

28:04.360 --> 28:06.560
With.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.000
It could all just be
a coincidence, though, right?

28:08.000 --> 28:09.680
It could all just be
a coincidence, though, right?

28:09.720 --> 28:12.000
Shiv could have been in Hamburg
for any number of reasons.

28:12.040 --> 28:14.880
How many reasons are there, do you
think, to be in Hamburg, George?

28:14.920 --> 28:16.000
I dunno.
We took a DNA sample from the hair

28:16.000 --> 28:19.040
I dunno.
We took a DNA sample from the hair

28:19.080 --> 28:23.040
that you retrieved from the scene.
It was Janet's.

28:23.080 --> 28:24.000
So if it was a coincidence
that Shiv was in the same

28:24.000 --> 28:25.560
So if it was a coincidence
that Shiv was in the same

28:25.600 --> 28:28.200
area at the same time,
then it's a pretty big one.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.680
These are the four men
that were killed at the scene.

28:30.720 --> 28:32.000
But we now know there
was another person there too.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.440
But we now know there
was another person there too.

28:33.480 --> 28:36.000
Security camera
on the morning of the shooting.

28:36.040 --> 28:39.360
Who's this?
Zhang Rui. A former agent

28:39.400 --> 28:40.000
for the Ministry of State Security.
Are we sure she's retired?

28:40.000 --> 28:42.840
for the Ministry of State Security.
Are we sure she's retired?

28:42.880 --> 28:46.520
That's what I'm trying to find out.
A group of unaffiliated mercenaries

28:46.560 --> 28:48.000
kidnapping a former
Lazarus agent is bad enough.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.360
kidnapping a former
Lazarus agent is bad enough.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.440
But if it's the Chinese government,

28:51.520 --> 28:56.000
then I think we can say that
we have ourselves a situation.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.080
then I think we can say that
we have ourselves a situation.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.480
So, what are we gonna do?
What's going on?

29:14.520 --> 29:16.760
Nothing. I'm gonna
go talk to some people.

29:16.800 --> 29:19.480
You're gonna talk to some people?
Yeah. Alone?

29:20.480 --> 29:22.800
Wes wants to keep
this small for now.

29:22.840 --> 29:26.200
Right. OK.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.000
Hang tight.

29:28.000 --> 29:28.240
Hang tight.

29:29.240 --> 29:32.000
Should we be worried?
Always.

29:59.840 --> 30:00.000
Hello.
Hi.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.160
Hello.
Hi.

30:03.520 --> 30:06.880
Um, everything all right?
Yeah. Um, er, yeah.

30:06.920 --> 30:08.000
It's weird to hear you. I'm
sorry for calling out of the blue.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.160
It's weird to hear you. I'm
sorry for calling out of the blue.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.200
That's... That's fine.

30:12.240 --> 30:16.000
I just wondered, could we meet?
Tomorrow maybe or...

30:16.000 --> 30:16.120
I just wondered, could we meet?
Tomorrow maybe or...

30:17.840 --> 30:21.360
Er, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I can... I can do tomorrow.

30:21.400 --> 30:23.800
Great. Er, thanks. It's not...
It's nothing important,

30:23.840 --> 30:24.000
I just, um, wanted to talk
to you about something. OK.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.480
I just, um, wanted to talk
to you about something. OK.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.360
It's nothing important,
I just, um... Yeah.

30:29.400 --> 30:32.000
Meet you at the cafe at nine? Yeah,
yeah. I'll... I'll see you then.

30:32.000 --> 30:32.560
Meet you at the cafe at nine? Yeah,
yeah. I'll... I'll see you then.

30:32.600 --> 30:35.040
OK. Bye.
Bye.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.000
Argh!

31:36.000 --> 31:36.400
Argh!

32:03.920 --> 32:06.520
Shiv, Shiv, Shiv.

32:06.560 --> 32:08.000
Shiv! Shiv! Shiv! Look at me, man.

32:08.000 --> 32:08.920
Shiv! Shiv! Shiv! Look at me, man.

32:13.120 --> 32:15.320
Oh, no, no, no.
Just... Just breathe, man!

32:15.360 --> 32:16.000
Breathe, man, breathe!

32:16.000 --> 32:17.360
Breathe, man, breathe!

32:43.520 --> 32:46.720
Oh, hey, Reggie! Er, how's it going?

32:46.760 --> 32:48.000
Yeah, is everything all right?

32:48.000 --> 32:49.200
Yeah, is everything all right?

32:49.240 --> 32:51.080
Yeah.
Oh, I just...

32:51.120 --> 32:53.760
Well, I, um, I heard a commotion.

32:53.800 --> 32:56.000
Oh, er, no, I was... I'm sorry,
I was just watching a movie.

32:56.000 --> 32:56.720
Oh, er, no, I was... I'm sorry,
I was just watching a movie.

32:56.760 --> 32:58.840
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

32:58.880 --> 33:02.800
Oh! That's some good speakers you
got. It sounded like a gun went off.

33:05.360 --> 33:09.120
No. I just... I... I didn't
realise how... how late it was.

33:12.320 --> 33:14.320
Well, I should probably...
Yeah.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.960
Fuck's sake.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.720
For fuck's sake, Shiv.

33:58.760 --> 34:00.000
What the fuck were you doing?

34:00.000 --> 34:01.480
What the fuck were you doing?

34:25.760 --> 34:27.760
Jesus Christ.

34:45.360 --> 34:48.000
For fuck's sake.

34:48.000 --> 34:48.280
For fuck's sake.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.240
Shit.

35:10.120 --> 35:12.000
Hi.

35:12.000 --> 35:12.120
Hi.

35:25.360 --> 35:27.520
How have you been?
Good.

35:27.560 --> 35:28.000
Er, yeah, you know, working hard.
How's the app?

35:28.000 --> 35:31.320
Er, yeah, you know, working hard.
How's the app?

35:31.360 --> 35:34.200
Oh, the app. Er, yeah, great, great.

35:34.240 --> 35:36.000
Doing really good. Strength
to strength. That's good.

35:36.000 --> 35:36.600
Doing really good. Strength
to strength. That's good.

35:36.640 --> 35:39.640
How is school?
The same.

35:39.680 --> 35:44.000
Er, the kids are great but...
Are you still in the flat?

35:44.000 --> 35:44.440
Er, the kids are great but...
Are you still in the flat?

35:45.440 --> 35:49.120
Er, yeah. Why, where are you?

35:49.160 --> 35:51.320
Other side of town.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.000
So, er, what's up?
What did you want to talk about?

35:52.000 --> 35:55.280
So, er, what's up?
What did you want to talk about?

35:58.600 --> 36:00.000
I've met someone.

36:00.000 --> 36:00.600
I've met someone.

36:02.040 --> 36:03.920
Oh!

36:03.960 --> 36:06.600
We're getting married.

36:06.640 --> 36:08.000
OK. Er, that's...

36:08.000 --> 36:08.680
OK. Er, that's...

36:08.720 --> 36:11.000
I didn't want you
to hear it on the grapevine

36:11.040 --> 36:13.680
or see it on social media or
anything. Yeah. Er, OK. I see.

36:13.720 --> 36:16.000
I... I... I don't stalk you
on there or anything. I know.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.320
I... I... I don't stalk you
on there or anything. I know.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.000
OK. Look, that's... that's...
You don't have to say anything.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.480
OK. Look, that's... that's...
You don't have to say anything.

36:26.520 --> 36:30.320
I know this is really weird, I know.
I just... I wanted to tell you.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.000
I wanted to tell you and I wanted
to say I'm sorry for how we ended.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.800
I wanted to tell you and I wanted
to say I'm sorry for how we ended.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.520
I never wanted to hurt you.

36:39.040 --> 36:40.000
Who... Who... Who...
Who are you marrying?

36:40.000 --> 36:41.720
Who... Who... Who...
Who are you marrying?

36:41.760 --> 36:43.760
No-one you know.

36:48.360 --> 36:50.400
I hope you don't hate me.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.440
That would be so much easier.

37:00.840 --> 37:04.000
Um... This could probably
have just been a text.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Um... This could probably
have just been a text.

37:46.400 --> 37:48.400
All right.
All right.

38:21.440 --> 38:23.880
This is Archie, leave a message.

38:23.920 --> 38:24.000
Archie, it's George.
Just call me back.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.080
Archie, it's George.
Just call me back.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.000
Just wondering
where the fuck you are.

38:32.000 --> 38:32.200
Just wondering
where the fuck you are.

38:56.440 --> 38:59.240
Mr Addo?
Yeah.

38:59.280 --> 39:01.760
DS Cooper.
OK.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.800
Do you have five minutes?
No.

39:03.840 --> 39:04.000
I wanted a chat with you
about an incident that occurred

39:04.000 --> 39:07.080
I wanted a chat with you
about an incident that occurred

39:07.120 --> 39:09.640
about three weeks ago.
Reports of a disturbance.

39:11.160 --> 39:12.000
Yeah, I wouldn't
know anything about that.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.160
Yeah, I wouldn't
know anything about that.

39:13.200 --> 39:16.080
You don't recall your whereabouts
three weeks ago, George?

39:16.120 --> 39:20.000
Huh? It would have been the night
of June the 30th, about midnight.

39:20.000 --> 39:20.240
Huh? It would have been the night
of June the 30th, about midnight.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.440
Um, I... I... I was at home.

39:24.880 --> 39:26.800
Yes, you were. Right.

39:27.800 --> 39:28.000
Do you remember using
the lift in your apartment

39:28.000 --> 39:33.440
Do you remember using
the lift in your apartment

39:33.480 --> 39:35.480
at30am?

39:38.760 --> 39:41.040
Do you like paperwork, DS Cooper?

39:41.080 --> 39:44.000
I fucking live for it.
Right. George Addo,

39:44.000 --> 39:44.240
I fucking live for it.
Right. George Addo,

39:44.280 --> 39:47.360
I'm arresting you on suspicion of
murder. You don't have to say...

40:01.040 --> 40:03.600
What the fuck was that?

40:09.160 --> 40:11.520
