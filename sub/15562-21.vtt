00:03.659 --> 00:05.138
What am I supposed to wear
to your wedding?

00:05.153 --> 00:06.894
The invitation just says, "Not basic."

00:07.060 --> 00:08.460
You know, not basic.

00:08.528 --> 00:10.629
I don't know how to explain it
more than that.

00:10.697 --> 00:12.964
Yeah, like, Adam's wearing a gray suit.

00:13.032 --> 00:14.933
Mm, I mean, that's, like, semi-basic,

00:15.034 --> 00:16.868
but you guys are old.

00:16.936 --> 00:18.234
No one's looking at you anyways.

00:18.234 --> 00:20.272
I didn't know you were bringing Adam.

00:20.340 --> 00:22.407
Yeah, I thought your marriage was, like,

00:26.813 --> 00:28.424
No, it's fine.

00:28.500 --> 00:31.088
We're in couples
counseling and it's fine,

00:31.160 --> 00:33.060
and, please, nobody
be weird around him.,

00:33.060 --> 00:33.952
- Okay?
- No...

00:34.020 --> 00:35.754
I'm, like, super cazh.

00:35.822 --> 00:38.034
And, please, nobody say "super cazh,"

00:38.082 --> 00:39.038
like, as a life rule.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.107
Well, personally,
I'm gonna wear a polo dress.

00:41.108 --> 00:43.724
All right? It's simple,
beautiful, elegant...

00:44.423 --> 00:45.788
Oh, but then again, I do have one

00:45.856 --> 00:47.290
of Nancy Pelosi's old pantsuits.

00:47.358 --> 00:48.458
I won it at an auction.

00:48.525 --> 00:49.459
Do you think that would be better?

00:49.557 --> 00:51.694
I'm actually just wearing
my bridesmaid's dress.

00:51.762 --> 00:53.062
You asked Amy to be a bridesmaid,

00:53.130 --> 00:54.330
but you didn't ask me?

00:54.398 --> 00:56.032
What? Ohhh!

00:56.100 --> 00:58.434
Uhhh...

00:58.502 --> 00:59.669
- Yah!
- I get it.

00:59.737 --> 01:00.903
Ah!

01:01.519 --> 01:03.339
I just kind of always wanted
to be a bridesmaid, and I...

01:04.033 --> 01:05.282
I don't know if I'll ever get
another chance.

01:05.283 --> 01:06.968
I mean...

01:07.036 --> 01:08.603
my sister's just so ugly.

01:08.671 --> 01:10.905
All right, Dina...

01:10.973 --> 01:13.074
you can be a bridesmaid.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.187
Yes! Oh!

01:14.188 --> 01:15.461
You will not regret this.

01:15.462 --> 01:18.079
Okay, I'm gonna need to see
my dress asap,

01:18.147 --> 01:19.826
in case I want to change
the cut or the color.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.310
Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

01:30.393 --> 01:32.162
Does this sound fancy to you?

01:32.995 --> 01:36.331
Nah, just sounds like gold
clinking up against crystal.

01:36.399 --> 01:37.266
What?

01:37.733 --> 01:40.335
Those are two of the
most expensive things!

01:40.403 --> 01:42.203
Relax, dude, it's not a competition.

01:42.204 --> 01:44.472
I just got something from the
"lost and found" bin at work.

01:44.540 --> 01:46.307
I don't want people spending money

01:46.375 --> 01:48.075
they might not have tomorrow.

01:50.046 --> 01:52.448
Corporate is making me
lay off six people.

01:52.527 --> 01:53.496
Whoa. There's gonna be layoffs?

01:53.498 --> 01:54.049
Shh!

01:54.566 --> 01:55.879
I don't want anyone to know.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.119
Okay, well, they're gonna find out
when the paychecks stop coming.

01:58.178 --> 02:00.267
- I'll tell them tomorrow.
- Mm.

02:00.276 --> 02:02.424
Cheyenne's wedding
should be a day of joy...

02:02.908 --> 02:04.341
that people look back on and say,

02:04.409 --> 02:05.842
"I was happy that day.

02:06.311 --> 02:08.779
That was the last day I was happy."

02:08.847 --> 02:10.548
- You look fine.
- Yeah? Fine?

02:10.649 --> 02:11.849
Yeah, fine. Yeah, good, like...

02:11.917 --> 02:13.084
like you always do.

02:13.151 --> 02:14.085
- Nice, you look nice.
- Thanks.

02:14.186 --> 02:15.319
You too.

02:15.387 --> 02:16.720
I feel like everyone is looking at us.

02:16.827 --> 02:18.062
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

02:18.063 --> 02:19.223
Adam, nobody's looking at us.

02:19.291 --> 02:20.257
Adam!

02:20.325 --> 02:21.258
Sorry. Adam.

02:21.326 --> 02:22.593
Hey!

02:22.661 --> 02:24.148
- How's it going, man?
- Good.

02:24.149 --> 02:26.028
You know what? Come on,
let's bring it in here.

02:26.028 --> 02:27.065
- Hey.
- Yeah!

02:27.132 --> 02:28.332
It's good to see you.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.202
What's up? What's new with you?

02:30.257 --> 02:32.425
I mean, with work, not...
not personal stuff.

02:32.734 --> 02:34.105
- Super cazh.
- No doubt.

02:34.172 --> 02:36.040
Still unemployed, but...

02:36.108 --> 02:37.475
Cool.

02:39.911 --> 02:41.395
- I'm Kristen, by the way.
- Yes!

02:41.601 --> 02:42.946
- That's Kristen.
- Hi.

02:43.192 --> 02:44.392
- My husband.
- My... my husband.

02:44.460 --> 02:46.294
- Sorry, that's... Yeah.
- It's my husband.

02:49.298 --> 02:50.398
Oh.

02:50.466 --> 02:52.633
- I...
- What are you doing here?

02:53.262 --> 02:54.740
- Hi.
- Hello.

02:54.788 --> 02:56.504
Jear Bear, can you go get my vape pen?

02:56.572 --> 02:58.203
I left it in the car.

02:58.425 --> 03:00.173
Oh, you're here together.

03:00.253 --> 03:01.920
Yeah! You remember Jerry.

03:01.988 --> 03:03.722
We all met at that restaurant.

03:03.790 --> 03:05.357
It's nice to see you again.

03:05.458 --> 03:07.126
It's nice to see you again...

03:07.193 --> 03:07.949
also.

03:09.763 --> 03:11.330
Kind of need that vape pen now.

03:11.397 --> 03:12.788
Right. Sorry.

03:14.188 --> 03:16.790
I love how strawberry
smoke smells in my hair.

03:17.504 --> 03:18.504
I bet.

03:23.141 --> 03:23.709
Chins up.

03:24.090 --> 03:25.611
Beautiful, ladies, perfect.

03:26.085 --> 03:26.985
Ma'am, could you lean back?

03:27.053 --> 03:28.320
There's a shadow on the bride.

03:28.388 --> 03:29.440
Oh, sure.

03:30.023 --> 03:31.557
How are you feeling? Are you nervous?

03:31.624 --> 03:33.200
No, just excited.

03:33.486 --> 03:35.047
Listen, I filled my purse
with muscle relaxants

03:35.119 --> 03:36.428
and anti-flatulent meds.

03:36.496 --> 03:38.197
Oh, and if you're gonna puke,
you can use the purse.

03:38.264 --> 03:39.108
Okay, thanks.

03:39.109 --> 03:40.832
Told you I'd be a good bridesmaid.

03:40.900 --> 03:42.534
It's okay to be nervous,
if you are, you know?

03:42.602 --> 03:44.336
I was totally nervous at my wedding.

03:44.404 --> 03:46.672
I was like, "Aah! Should I run away?"

03:46.739 --> 03:48.207
Wouldn't that be so funny

03:48.274 --> 03:49.474
if you just, like, ran away

03:49.542 --> 03:51.798
and went to college or something?

03:52.028 --> 03:53.145
I was just kidding.

03:53.213 --> 03:55.289
What if we did our squad pose?

03:55.361 --> 03:58.062
Yeah! Squad pose!

03:58.084 --> 03:58.983
Oh, yeah.

03:58.985 --> 04:00.119
Oh, okay...

04:00.332 --> 04:01.499
- Dina, just...
- I'm sorry.

04:01.567 --> 04:02.634
- Maybe lean...
- What?

04:02.701 --> 04:03.668
- Just lean.
- I'm leaning.

04:03.736 --> 04:04.569
- Lean in.
- I'm leaning!

04:04.670 --> 04:05.637
Shadow.

04:05.704 --> 04:06.671
I can't control the sun!

04:06.827 --> 04:08.873
Yo, fellas, like,
"sinceriously," thank you

04:08.941 --> 04:10.842
for attending my nuptials
and what-have-you-not.

04:10.910 --> 04:12.119
- Sure.
- Yeah.

04:12.150 --> 04:13.712
You know what? Like, life is crazy.

04:13.846 --> 04:14.979
I never thought I'd have
so many nerds at my wedding.

04:15.047 --> 04:15.980
You know what I'm saying? Ha.

04:16.048 --> 04:17.882
Ooh! Drama.

04:17.950 --> 04:19.584
Amy's real husband.

04:19.652 --> 04:21.019
Amy's work husband.

04:21.086 --> 04:22.787
- Work husband?
- Huh.

04:22.855 --> 04:24.856
- Should I be worried?
- No!

04:24.924 --> 04:26.802
No, I mean... No, I got you.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.154
Yeah, you look out!

04:28.155 --> 04:30.050
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

04:30.052 --> 04:31.952
Yeah, yeah, you are Amy's work husband.

04:31.953 --> 04:33.785
I see you two together,
like, all the time,

04:33.786 --> 04:36.122
walking around, you know...

04:36.223 --> 04:37.990
It's like he's got wedding brain.

04:38.058 --> 04:39.925
Sure. Okay.

04:39.993 --> 04:42.061
Whoa! Easy on the shrimp!

04:42.129 --> 04:43.896
Those are supposed to be for everybody.

04:43.964 --> 04:44.997
I only took a few.

04:45.065 --> 04:46.499
Yeah, took a few hundred.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.134
- All right, put that back.
- Okay.

04:48.201 --> 04:50.403
Yo, keep this girl away from the ocean!

04:50.504 --> 04:52.371
That's where all the shrimp's at.

04:52.439 --> 04:55.574
These people aren't cogs
you can just throw away.

04:55.642 --> 04:56.876
They're a family.

04:56.977 --> 04:59.712
They talk. They stand around.

04:59.813 --> 05:01.947
I guess that's all
they're doing right now.

05:02.618 --> 05:04.483
I wish Jeff could see this.

05:04.551 --> 05:06.786
Maybe I should invite Jeff here.

05:06.853 --> 05:07.820
Yes.

05:07.888 --> 05:10.189
You should definitely do that.

What is he wearing?

05:26.145 --> 05:27.611
He looks like a woman.

05:27.698 --> 05:28.488
Bo?

05:28.895 --> 05:29.929
Bo is a woman.

05:30.138 --> 05:31.005
Oh?

05:31.250 --> 05:32.376
Lesbians.

05:32.378 --> 05:33.812
Big-time.

05:34.086 --> 05:36.988
The whole world's going gay.

05:38.724 --> 05:39.657
Bigger steps.

05:39.725 --> 05:41.092
You guys are killing our pace.

05:41.160 --> 05:43.428
And one of you is wearing
too much Cool Water.

05:43.496 --> 05:44.596
Yeah, that's me, Dina.

05:44.663 --> 05:46.498
Aw, Amy looks beautiful.

05:46.565 --> 05:47.699
Not my type.

05:47.767 --> 05:48.833
Mm-mm. No, I only like

05:48.901 --> 05:51.736
tall, blue-eyed blondes...

05:51.804 --> 05:55.306
and shorter Asians, but that is it.

06:12.191 --> 06:14.709
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here today

06:14.749 --> 06:17.162
to witness the union
of Cheyenne Taylor Lee

06:17.434 --> 06:20.055
and Bilbo Derek Thompson
in holy matrimony,

06:20.057 --> 06:21.566
to be joined as husband and wife

06:22.276 --> 06:23.242
for all eternity.

06:23.310 --> 06:24.297
No, I can't do this, okay? No.

06:24.299 --> 06:25.399
Bo, stop it.

06:26.051 --> 06:28.181
No, okay? I got to be free.
You can't chain me down!

06:30.018 --> 06:32.018
Do you have to do this right now?

06:32.086 --> 06:33.953
Cheyenne, maybe it's for the best.

06:34.021 --> 06:35.822
No, what's up? This can't wait, okay?

06:35.889 --> 06:37.590
Okay, I can't stand up in here
and say all these words

06:37.658 --> 06:39.168
about loving you forever.

06:41.128 --> 06:42.829
But I can rap them.

06:42.896 --> 06:45.031
Then we're gonna need a sick-ass beat.

07:06.958 --> 07:09.293
Ain't no way I'm getting
hitched to my ride-or-die

07:09.361 --> 07:11.095
without my boys here repping me, son.

07:11.162 --> 07:12.963
What's up?

07:13.031 --> 07:14.098
Yeah!

07:14.165 --> 07:16.266
Auntie Beth! Oh, my!

07:16.334 --> 07:17.982
So good to see you.

07:17.983 --> 07:19.503
Are you getting younger or prettier?

07:19.571 --> 07:21.005
I can't tell.

07:24.976 --> 07:26.710
- Ow!
- Relax, Bridezilla.

07:26.778 --> 07:28.178
So, as your bridesmaid,

07:28.246 --> 07:30.948
I'm supposed to come
hold your dress while you...

07:31.016 --> 07:32.716
you know, piss and [bleep].

07:32.817 --> 07:34.451
And I'm clocking you in at three hours

07:34.552 --> 07:35.586
since your last pit stop.

07:35.588 --> 07:37.522
Um, I-I'm good, thank you.

07:37.689 --> 07:38.594
Yeah.

07:38.631 --> 07:40.699
For me, now is kind of perfect,

07:40.959 --> 07:43.661
because those mini pizzas
you served earlier are just...

07:43.728 --> 07:44.461
not sitting.

07:45.163 --> 07:46.603
Okay, fine, I'll go.

07:46.635 --> 07:47.464
Let's do this.

07:47.598 --> 07:49.432
Oh! Table three.

07:49.434 --> 07:50.937
Party table. Whoo!

07:51.112 --> 07:53.261
- Whoo!
- Ooh-ah.

07:53.373 --> 07:55.141
No, that... that's not
what we were doing.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.344
Yeah, I know.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.011
Um...

07:59.079 --> 08:00.679
Oh, okay.

08:00.747 --> 08:03.048
Uh, you know what? Maybe we
should sit somewhere else.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.717
Pretty sure you're supposed
to sit at the table

08:04.784 --> 08:05.728
they tell you to.

08:05.729 --> 08:07.329
Okay, square.

08:07.396 --> 08:09.598
I don't know how
you stayed married to her.

08:09.665 --> 08:11.533
I didn't mean... That wasn't...

08:11.634 --> 08:12.667
Um, cool!

08:12.735 --> 08:14.169
Cool, cool.

08:14.237 --> 08:15.370
All right.

08:15.438 --> 08:17.202
How're we doing over here, huh?

08:17.289 --> 08:18.139
What are you doing?

08:18.207 --> 08:19.608
I just like to sit...

08:19.675 --> 08:22.177
facing Elias.

08:22.245 --> 08:24.145
Hey.

08:24.213 --> 08:26.719
Table nine, the buffet is now open.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.163
Go wild.

08:28.259 --> 08:29.559
You're making announcements?

08:29.560 --> 08:31.010
Doesn't it feel like
you're just at work?

08:31.095 --> 08:33.621
Well, what can I say, man?
I just love the power.

08:33.621 --> 08:35.114
Table eight.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.640
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

08:37.568 --> 08:38.830
Now you can go.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.354
- Hey.
- There you are!

08:41.421 --> 08:42.355
What's the emergency?

08:42.422 --> 08:44.256
- Oh, my God.
- What?

08:44.324 --> 08:46.125
You remember Cheyenne, don't you?

08:46.193 --> 08:47.927
She just got married.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.296
Hi. Yes, this is your wedding.

08:50.364 --> 08:51.964
So why would you...
I'm sorry that I'm...

08:52.032 --> 08:52.898
I'm wearing shorts.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.417
I was at a Frisbee golf thing.

08:54.418 --> 08:55.868
- Cool.
- It's cool. It's cool.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.670
Hey, fun fact about Cheyenne

08:57.771 --> 08:59.905
is she's severely uneducated,

08:59.973 --> 09:03.542
so her job's the only thing standing
between her and prostitution.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.845
Now, let me introduce you
to some other peeps

09:05.912 --> 09:07.580
who are right on the poverty line.

09:07.648 --> 09:08.714
I'm sorry about the...

09:08.815 --> 09:10.434
- I never prostituted.
- No.

09:12.519 --> 09:13.753
- What you have been...
- So how have...

09:13.820 --> 09:15.755
Sorry.

09:15.822 --> 09:16.922
You go.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.557
How's your boyfriend?

09:18.625 --> 09:19.659
We're not dating anymore.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.761
Oh. Um...

09:21.828 --> 09:22.995
I'm sorry to hear that.

09:23.063 --> 09:23.987
Yeah.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.244
I made him up.

09:30.344 --> 09:31.279
- Okay.
- Thank you.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.145
Bye. Yeah. Here you go.

09:33.146 --> 09:35.551
I need a super-embarrassing
story about you.

09:35.552 --> 09:37.251
- Why?
- It's just for my speech.

09:37.258 --> 09:38.117
And it's not essential,

09:38.118 --> 09:41.209
but if it could rhyme with
"fellatio," that would be icing.

09:41.210 --> 09:43.670
No, Dina, most of the bridesmaids
aren't giving toasts.

09:43.671 --> 09:44.753
- I'm not.
- Well...

09:45.173 --> 09:47.211
I mean, no offense,
but you're not funny.

09:47.212 --> 09:48.277
I'm funny.

09:48.278 --> 09:49.783
Sure, you're hilarious.

09:49.784 --> 09:50.531
Come on.

09:50.532 --> 09:52.152
Oh, my God. You look so gorgeous.

09:52.153 --> 09:53.368
The ceremony was beautiful.

09:53.369 --> 09:54.754
Why the hell did you invite Jeff?

09:54.755 --> 09:57.227
I didn't. I think he came with Glenn.

09:57.228 --> 09:58.954
No, a-as a friend.

09:58.955 --> 10:01.303
I'm not ready to talk to Jeff right now.

10:01.304 --> 10:03.646
Mateo, you think I'm funny, right?

10:04.618 --> 10:05.820
Uh-huh.

10:05.821 --> 10:09.344
Attention, wedding guests,
specifically Bo's friends.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.964
Just because I'm a DJ

10:10.965 --> 10:13.173
does not mean I am "carrying" Molly.

10:13.556 --> 10:15.112
So please stop asking.

10:15.501 --> 10:17.353
Thank you for shopping at Cloud 9.

10:17.631 --> 10:19.659
Damn it. Sorry. Force of habit.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.546
Justine lives in a studio apartment,

10:21.919 --> 10:25.705
and she's 40, so obviously
a lot of need there.

10:27.042 --> 10:28.307
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

10:28.374 --> 10:29.514
Uh, Glenn.

10:29.515 --> 10:30.892
- What?
- I'm... I'm gonna leave now.

10:30.923 --> 10:32.958
- Why?
- Because this is a wedding

10:32.959 --> 10:34.182
that I was not invited to.

10:34.183 --> 10:35.352
Plus, I'm wearing shorts.

10:35.353 --> 10:37.056
I didn't make you wear shorts.

10:37.057 --> 10:38.819
Still, I'm just gonna...

10:38.820 --> 10:39.815
- I got to go.
- No, no, no.

10:39.838 --> 10:41.456
You can't leave without saying hi

10:41.457 --> 10:43.956
to Cheyenne's adorable daughter,

10:43.957 --> 10:44.993
Harmonica.

10:44.994 --> 10:46.970
And don't let those
chubby cheeks fool you.

10:46.971 --> 10:49.393
If her parents can't
keep buying food for her...

10:49.909 --> 10:50.807
she'll die.

10:51.220 --> 10:53.833
I'm gonna show you to somebody, yeah.

10:55.936 --> 10:57.270
Wait.

10:57.337 --> 10:59.457
What am I supposed to do with this?

11:09.859 --> 11:11.459
Okay...

11:11.527 --> 11:12.994
Mama.

11:13.062 --> 11:14.796
What is his game?

11:14.864 --> 11:16.731
He just shows up out of nowhere,

11:16.799 --> 11:19.425
flashing those legs,
carrying a baby around.

11:19.426 --> 11:21.571
I get it... you're father material.

11:22.323 --> 11:24.686
I mean, I hate kids, but I love dads.

11:26.414 --> 11:29.039
So do you always play the man?

11:29.040 --> 11:30.712
Uh... yeah.

11:30.780 --> 11:32.247
Yeah, most of the time.

11:32.314 --> 11:35.684
Oh, that's... that's wonderful.

11:35.751 --> 11:36.518
Yeah.

11:36.842 --> 11:39.254
Oh, I see you went
with the Pink Cheyenne.

11:39.355 --> 11:43.191
Yeah, it's Code Red,
vodka, and 13 cherries.

11:43.259 --> 11:44.626
I'm kind of into it.

11:44.694 --> 11:46.396
Oh, look. There you guys are.

11:47.249 --> 11:48.563
Oh, that's cute.

11:48.631 --> 11:49.764
Yeah, yeah.

11:49.832 --> 11:51.533
But that is atypical, you know?

11:51.600 --> 11:53.401
If you caught us on a normal day,

11:53.469 --> 11:55.403
she'd probably have her hands
around my neck, you know...

11:55.471 --> 11:57.005
"Jonah, you screwed up again.

11:57.073 --> 11:58.406
Go clean Softlines."

11:58.474 --> 11:59.474
Okay, I don't talk like that.

11:59.542 --> 12:01.209
Well, sometimes.

12:01.277 --> 12:03.111
"Adam, wash your tennis shoes.

12:03.179 --> 12:04.412
"They're disgusting."

12:04.480 --> 12:06.147
Okay, well, they are disgusting

12:06.215 --> 12:07.716
'cause there was a family
of spiders living in them, so...

12:07.783 --> 12:10.351
Okay, well, they're my
shoes, and I paid for them,

12:10.419 --> 12:11.986
so it's kind of none of your business.

12:12.054 --> 12:13.521
Yeah, well, I was just
asking you to be an adult

12:13.589 --> 12:15.156
every now and then, so...
I know, but still.

12:15.224 --> 12:16.424
Yeah, okay.

12:18.494 --> 12:19.890
I'm Team Adam.

12:21.363 --> 12:23.298
All right, ladies and gents.

12:23.365 --> 12:25.600
I'm gonna get this thing
humming with a few jokes.

12:25.668 --> 12:27.235
Dina, you really don't have to.

12:27.303 --> 12:28.603
No, it's okay. It's okay.

12:28.671 --> 12:30.692
I'm a bridesmaid. It's part of my job.

12:30.962 --> 12:32.574
All right, joke one...

12:32.641 --> 12:35.110
marriage is a three-ring circus,

12:35.211 --> 12:37.045
engagement ring,

12:37.113 --> 12:38.546
wedding ring,

12:38.614 --> 12:40.415
suffering.

12:42.785 --> 12:43.985
So...

12:44.053 --> 12:45.356
that was joke one.

12:51.327 --> 12:53.094
That's a grammar joke.

12:53.617 --> 12:54.846
If English isn't your first language,

12:54.847 --> 12:56.462
that one may be lost on you.

12:57.307 --> 12:59.622
Okay, next up...

12:59.690 --> 13:02.425
what do you call a woman
who likes small penises?

13:02.492 --> 13:04.227
- Hopefully Cheyenne.
- Okay.

13:04.294 --> 13:05.394
I'm kidding.
The little ones tend to be...

13:05.462 --> 13:07.010
All right, thank you, Dina,

13:07.011 --> 13:09.699
for those beautiful
and appropriate words.

13:09.766 --> 13:10.766
Yeah, well, good luck,

13:10.834 --> 13:12.327
'cause this crowd blows!

13:14.997 --> 13:16.130
Uh, hi.

13:16.132 --> 13:17.466
I just wanted to say

13:17.774 --> 13:20.887
congratulations to Cheyenne and Bo.

13:22.646 --> 13:24.213
Um...

13:24.281 --> 13:26.549
uh, I... I love you, Cheyenne.

13:27.116 --> 13:29.385
You remind me of me.

13:29.453 --> 13:32.054
I-I also met my husband in high school,

13:32.122 --> 13:34.023
and we did the whole "baby first" thing,

13:34.091 --> 13:36.125
and then got married because we had to.

13:36.193 --> 13:37.426
I mean, not... Wah!

13:37.494 --> 13:39.262
I didn't mean we had to. I meant...

13:39.329 --> 13:42.131
I meant we got pregnant
so we got married...

13:42.199 --> 13:44.100
but, um, marriage is amazing!

13:44.167 --> 13:46.002
I mean, is it hard work?

13:46.069 --> 13:47.672
Yes. Duh.

13:47.673 --> 13:49.367
Like, that's the cliché, right?

13:49.375 --> 13:51.307
"Ah, it's so hard," because it is.

13:51.375 --> 13:53.142
You know, one second everything's great,

13:53.210 --> 13:56.350
and then you step on some invisible
land mine, and you're fighting.

13:56.351 --> 13:57.964
Boom! Ka-boom!

13:58.509 --> 13:59.672
Uh...

14:00.689 --> 14:02.790
'Cause it's hard. It's just...
It's hard.

14:02.858 --> 14:03.784
But...

14:03.785 --> 14:05.793
it is the hard

14:05.861 --> 14:07.626
that makes it good.

14:09.231 --> 14:10.397
That... that wasn't me.

14:10.447 --> 14:11.873
That was from "A League of Their Own."

14:11.874 --> 14:14.539
Why did Madonna and Rosie
O'Donnell stop being friends?

14:14.541 --> 14:16.106
I feel like something
happened there, right?

14:16.107 --> 14:17.850
Maybe we should talk about that.

14:19.674 --> 14:21.842
The desert table is now open

14:21.910 --> 14:24.940
for anybody who would
like to stop talking.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.912
But, okay, what I'm trying to say

14:27.913 --> 14:30.785
is that no matter how tough it gets,

14:30.852 --> 14:32.453
it's gonna be fine.

14:32.521 --> 14:34.288
It's gonna be...

14:34.356 --> 14:36.257
so...

14:36.324 --> 14:37.291
fine.

14:37.866 --> 14:38.699
You know?

14:39.060 --> 14:39.794
Just give me the... Give it...

14:39.861 --> 14:41.095
- But I...
- Give it to me.

14:42.364 --> 14:43.697
You heard it here first, folks.

14:43.765 --> 14:45.366
Marriage is fine.

14:45.433 --> 14:47.101
Yikes.

14:48.931 --> 14:51.032
Oh! Oh, you like the joke
about Amy's marriage?

14:51.091 --> 14:52.173
'Cause I got a ton of those.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.547
Amy's marriage is so bad...

14:54.694 --> 14:56.801
How bad is it?

15:08.283 --> 15:10.385
Wow. You're a really good dancer.

15:10.559 --> 15:12.083
Thanks. You too.

15:18.008 --> 15:19.797
Hey, do you think Amy's okay?

15:19.972 --> 15:22.087
Aw. You worried about your work wife?

15:22.088 --> 15:23.991
Me? No. No, I don't even care about her.

15:23.999 --> 15:24.787
No.

15:24.788 --> 15:26.562
Hey. We should move in together.

15:26.563 --> 15:27.556
What?

15:27.557 --> 15:29.668
Dude, what is with you tonight?

15:32.466 --> 15:34.940
I'm tired. I think I want to head out.

15:35.041 --> 15:35.836
Okay, yeah.

15:35.837 --> 15:37.689
I'll just say good-bye
to everybody, and we can go.

15:37.690 --> 15:39.292
No, you should stay.

15:39.434 --> 15:40.241
I'll grab a cab.

15:40.242 --> 15:41.506
Adam.

15:42.683 --> 15:44.950
Look, I'm sorry about the toast, okay?

15:44.951 --> 15:47.047
I-I-I didn't know what to say.

15:47.048 --> 15:48.495
I just... I started rambling,

15:48.496 --> 15:49.874
and then I couldn't stop rambling.

15:49.875 --> 15:50.370
I wasn't even...

15:50.371 --> 15:53.463
Would you have married me
if we hadn't gotten pregnant?

15:56.454 --> 15:57.831
Would you have asked?

16:02.637 --> 16:04.736
Well, then what are we doing?

16:06.278 --> 16:08.693
- Thank you.
- Dina, this is for you.

16:08.971 --> 16:10.047
What's this?

16:10.048 --> 16:12.972
It's my bridesmaid gift,
just to say thank you.

16:13.898 --> 16:14.781
Oh.

16:16.052 --> 16:17.389
You're welcome.

16:19.118 --> 16:21.062
You know what?
Actually, I don't feel comfortable

16:21.063 --> 16:22.712
taking cheap jewelry into my house.

16:22.713 --> 16:23.900
One of the birds is gonna get into it,

16:23.908 --> 16:26.041
then it's another midnight
run to the urgent care.

16:26.042 --> 16:29.245
So I think you should return it
and just give me the cash.

16:31.169 --> 16:32.356
Thanks, girl.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.423
Sometimes the headline will say,

16:35.424 --> 16:37.553
"What happens next is unbelievable,"

16:37.554 --> 16:40.331
but then it's, like,
kind of underwhelming.

16:40.332 --> 16:40.952
I know.

16:40.953 --> 16:43.822
It's almost like they're trying
to trick me into clicking.

16:43.823 --> 16:45.576
I'm tired. Let's go.

16:45.577 --> 16:47.271
Already? They haven't even cut the cake.

16:47.279 --> 16:48.834
I've seen people cut cake before.

16:48.835 --> 16:49.686
Let's go.

16:52.377 --> 16:54.144
I really enjoyed talking to you.

16:54.267 --> 16:55.771
I really enjoyed talking to you, too.

16:55.772 --> 16:57.786
I can't start the car with my mind!

16:58.597 --> 16:59.530
Bye.

16:59.597 --> 17:01.198
Bye.

17:06.604 --> 17:08.538
- Jeff!
- Shh.

17:08.606 --> 17:09.739
This baby's asleep.

17:10.126 --> 17:12.146
Have you been
at the wedding this entire time?

17:12.200 --> 17:12.733
Yes.

17:12.734 --> 17:15.531
You saw me when I came in, and
then I think we made eye contact

17:15.532 --> 17:17.290
when we were both in line
for the bathroom a while ago.

17:17.292 --> 17:19.917
I don't think so. I...

17:19.919 --> 17:22.285
Anyway, um, it's good to see you.

17:22.353 --> 17:23.788
Not you. I hate you.

17:24.231 --> 17:25.258
- What?
- Yeah!

17:25.259 --> 17:28.191
You dumped me out of nowhere,
so of course I hate you.

17:28.259 --> 17:29.593
It just sounds funny
because I'm whispering.

17:29.660 --> 17:31.128
Because I don't want to wake
the baby up because...

17:31.195 --> 17:32.395
And thank you.

17:32.463 --> 17:35.132
Now she's awake.

17:35.199 --> 17:36.489
You just can't stop hurting me.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.412
Okay, here we go. I'm gonna trade you.

17:38.413 --> 17:40.203
You take her.

17:40.271 --> 17:41.805
She doesn't like to bounced, okay?

17:41.873 --> 17:43.140
I hate you.

17:43.207 --> 17:44.652
Not you. I love you.

18:01.159 --> 18:02.059
Hey.

18:03.528 --> 18:04.561
Hi.

18:05.082 --> 18:07.497
Just getting some fresh air.

18:08.260 --> 18:09.302
Where's Kristen?

18:09.304 --> 18:12.097
Uh, Kristen needed a break...

18:13.479 --> 18:15.546
From me.

18:18.666 --> 18:19.633
Where's Adam?

18:19.734 --> 18:21.468
Uh, Adam went home.

18:23.338 --> 18:24.805
Ah.

18:25.554 --> 18:26.607
Uh, well...

18:26.674 --> 18:28.542
I'll... I'll leave you alone.

18:28.610 --> 18:30.362
I think my marriage is over.

18:33.268 --> 18:35.917
That's the first time
I've said that out loud.

18:39.320 --> 18:41.651
Mm, you gonna say something or...?

18:45.493 --> 18:47.124
I don't know what to say.

18:47.829 --> 18:49.830
Well, that's a first.

18:51.566 --> 18:55.135
If anybody can get
through this, you can.

18:55.922 --> 18:57.021
Okay.

18:57.022 --> 19:00.140
No, no, I'm not...
I'm not just saying that.

19:00.142 --> 19:01.348
You're... you're...

19:02.210 --> 19:04.178
you're tough...

19:04.245 --> 19:06.446
and, uh... and persistent

19:06.514 --> 19:08.415
and decisive.

19:08.483 --> 19:11.704
Mm. Kind of sounds like you're
calling me stubborn.

19:11.705 --> 19:15.155
Yeah, well...

19:15.223 --> 19:16.456
you are insanely stubborn and...

19:16.524 --> 19:17.632
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

19:17.633 --> 19:19.426
- A little domineering...
- Uh-huh.

19:19.494 --> 19:20.460
Caustic maybe.

19:20.528 --> 19:21.454
- Caustic?
- Yeah.

19:21.455 --> 19:23.297
When I catch you before coffee time...

19:23.997 --> 19:26.767
You're downright hostile.

19:26.834 --> 19:28.535
Yeah.

19:28.603 --> 19:30.204
Yeah, you're not wrong.

19:30.271 --> 19:31.311
Yeah.

19:31.335 --> 19:34.917
So just, like, in general,
a pretty unpleasant person.

19:34.918 --> 19:37.144
- Yeah, pretty unpleasant, yeah.
- Okay.

19:37.212 --> 19:39.038
Notice.

19:41.433 --> 19:45.352
But you're also the most honest
person that I've ever met.

19:47.014 --> 19:49.949
And you're strong

19:50.525 --> 19:51.703
and smart...

19:53.061 --> 19:54.127
and funny,

19:54.362 --> 19:58.298
and you're confident and caring,

19:58.366 --> 20:01.568
and you're sexy and...

20:01.636 --> 20:02.618
Um...

20:03.664 --> 20:04.406
That... I didn't...

20:04.408 --> 20:05.758
- No, I...
- I wasn't try...

20:05.759 --> 20:07.598
- That was just me...
- Uh, yeah. No, I...

20:07.599 --> 20:08.698
- I so didn't...
- No No

20:08.700 --> 20:09.502
I had a few drinks.

20:09.504 --> 20:10.527
It's fine. I just...

20:10.528 --> 20:13.169
I think that it's time
to cut the cake, so...

20:13.724 --> 20:15.576
I'm just... I'm gonna go inside.

20:16.263 --> 20:17.463
Okay. Yeah.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.500
Um... thank you.

20:19.594 --> 20:20.561
Thanks, yeah.

20:34.829 --> 20:35.428
Hello.

20:36.603 --> 20:37.494
Oh.

20:39.367 --> 20:40.826
Did you forget something?

20:40.827 --> 20:42.080
Yeah.

20:42.910 --> 20:44.304
I forgot to do this.

20:45.804 --> 20:46.904
Oh, um...

20:47.107 --> 20:48.540
is it okay if I kiss you?

20:49.064 --> 20:49.876
Okay.

20:52.456 --> 20:54.942
Hey, everyone,
Bo and I just want to say thanks

20:54.943 --> 20:57.317
for making our wedding so dope.

20:57.731 --> 21:00.978
Oh, and shout-out to Boonville
Women's Correctional Facility

21:00.979 --> 21:03.437
for letting my mom Skype in
during the ceremony.

21:03.439 --> 21:05.011
Where's Jeff?

21:05.019 --> 21:06.151
Looks like he's leaving.

21:06.152 --> 21:08.967
To see the love in here
and have my work family

21:08.968 --> 21:11.854
and my real family and my friend family

21:11.854 --> 21:13.307
and my mall family and...

21:13.367 --> 21:15.425
To piggyback on Cheyenne,

21:15.426 --> 21:17.416
at Cloud 9, we're not just coworkers.

21:17.417 --> 21:19.305
We're a family.

21:19.373 --> 21:22.572
Jeff, please don't make
me fire my family!

21:31.143 --> 21:33.683
Right. Who's ready
to do the Chicken Dance?
