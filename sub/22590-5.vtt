00:11.638 --> 00:14.265
<i>NARRATOR".
Daybreak at Gotham City Library...</i>

00:14.432 --> 00:20.021
<i>where Penguin has just purloined</i>
a <i>priceless folio of famous umbrellas.</i>

00:20.230 --> 00:24.943
Ha, ha, ha. I know where to dispose of you
for a good price.

00:25.109 --> 00:30.198
Then Lulu and I are off to the races.
Ha, ha, ha.

00:30.365 --> 00:34.369
- Caught with the goods, eh, Penguin?
-Faugh, how did you get unglued?

00:34.536 --> 00:37.705
- Hand over that folio, you feathered felon.
-And come quietly.

00:38.331 --> 00:42.460
Oh, I always knew
I'd come to the end of the road.

00:49.175 --> 00:50.635
Holy diversionary tactic.

00:50.802 --> 00:52.762
I'll have my men pick him up in a jiffy.

00:52.929 --> 00:54.889
- No.
-No?

00:55.181 --> 00:58.893
Since we didn't apprehend him in this office
and he got away with the folio...

00:59.060 --> 01:02.522
...let's let him play out his hand.
I suspect that this robbery...

01:02.689 --> 01:05.275
...is only part of a much bigger caper.

01:05.441 --> 01:08.361
Escaped? With the folio?

01:08.528 --> 01:12.574
- Hello, Ms. Gordon.
-Hello, Batman, Robin, Chief O'Hara.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.450
And last but not least...

01:14.617 --> 01:17.662
I told you we can handle this.
You needn't have gotten up so early.

01:17.829 --> 01:21.541
Well, it was almost time to open anyway,
Daddy. Who was it? The Penguin again?

01:21.708 --> 01:25.461
Yes, and that slimy bird
slipped right through our fingers.

01:25.628 --> 01:27.422
I guess I better phone Bruce Wayne.

01:27.589 --> 01:31.593
As head of the library's board of trustees,
he'd be upset at the loss of a rare item.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.178
You needn't bother Mr. Wayne
needlessly, Ms. Gordon.

01:34.345 --> 01:38.683
- Needlessly? That folio is invaluable.
<i>- I'll</i> have that folio back within an hour.

01:38.850 --> 01:42.604
I suspected he might make this move
and I prepared a counter one.

01:42.770 --> 01:46.024
Today is the day
of the Bruce Wayne Foundation Handicap...

01:46.190 --> 01:48.610
...at Gotham Park Racetrack.

01:48.776 --> 01:52.905
I'm sure Mr. Wayne
has many other important things on his mind.

01:53.072 --> 01:56.034
Well, Robin, to the Batcave.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.237
Lulu, that's magnificent.

03:14.404 --> 03:18.950
That is the sharpest-looking horse
of another color I've ever seen in my life.

03:19.117 --> 03:21.244
At least nobody will recognize him.

03:21.411 --> 03:24.997
But I do hope nobody recognizes
that the horse from the glue factory...

03:25.164 --> 03:27.959
...in Parasol's stall is a phony.

03:28.126 --> 03:31.295
By the time they do, the race will be over.
Ha, ha, ha.

03:31.462 --> 03:33.756
What about the track officials, the jockey?

03:33.923 --> 03:36.217
Wally Bootmaker
is supposed to ride Parasol.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.468
He's not blind.

03:37.635 --> 03:39.721
Don't worry about Wally Bootmaker.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.306
My two finks will take care of him
when they get back.

03:44.142 --> 03:47.145
Well, here we are. Business as usual, huh?

03:48.938 --> 03:50.732
Penguin's Bookshop.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.442
Hello, Sammy.

03:52.608 --> 03:54.152
Iron Marshmallow in the big race.

03:54.318 --> 03:56.571
No, listen, I got a tip it's gonna be scratched.

03:56.738 --> 04:00.533
Matter of fact, I got a tip that all but two
of the horses are gonna be scratched.

04:00.700 --> 04:03.202
Parasol and a late entry
by the name of Bumbershoot.

04:03.369 --> 04:06.998
But the big bet, Sammy, is Parasol.

04:07.165 --> 04:11.669
All right, I'll take it, but pay cash, Sammy.
Ha, ha, ha.

04:12.879 --> 04:15.423
What do you mean, all but two horses
will be scratched?

04:15.590 --> 04:18.718
-"Scratched" means withdrawn from the race.
-I know what it means.

04:18.885 --> 04:21.262
- But what do you mean, Pengy?
-I got a plan.

04:21.428 --> 04:25.016
I hope so. But why did you tell him
to bet on Parasol and not on Bumbershoot?

04:25.183 --> 04:29.228
Because the more money that's bet
on that phony nag, which is bound to lose...

04:29.395 --> 04:32.190
...the more money we'll make
because the odds will be higher.

04:32.356 --> 04:36.194
All I have to do is to unload this folio there
and get some money to bet.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.781
- What's that, the racing news?
-No, this is the Saturday review of folios.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.784
All the rich collectors and advertisers.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.702
Wait a minute.

04:44.869 --> 04:46.579
This sounds like a pigeon.

04:46.746 --> 04:48.706
"Wanted. For private collections.

04:48.873 --> 04:52.502
Priceless folios of all famous articles,
particularly parasols.

04:52.668 --> 04:55.713
Will pay top prices. Mr. A. L. Fredd."

04:55.880 --> 04:57.507
The Gotham West Hotel.

04:57.673 --> 05:00.009
That's a very, very wealthy hotel.

05:00.176 --> 05:04.013
I'll just call. I'm sure that our 10 grand
is gonna be in the feed bag, Lulu.

05:04.180 --> 05:06.808
It's not Lulu. It's Lola Lasagne.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.851
Well, have it your way.

05:09.018 --> 05:11.562
Lasagne, macaroni, whatever.

05:11.729 --> 05:16.108
Hello, will you give me Mr. A.L. Fredd?
It's the Penguin Bookshop for him.

05:16.943 --> 05:18.194
Heh.

05:18.361 --> 05:19.821
Hello, Mr. A.L. Fredd?

05:20.238 --> 05:23.115
Yes, this is A.L. Fredd.

05:25.284 --> 05:28.412
- Should we take this up with the Batcomputer?
-Take what up?

05:28.579 --> 05:30.957
The location of Penguin's hideout,
for one thing.

05:31.123 --> 05:34.919
It's a little bookmaking shop
on Fleece Street.

05:35.336 --> 05:39.215
I did a little extracurricular crime-detecting
while Dick Grayson did his homework.

05:39.382 --> 05:42.760
And also found out you're
gonna have that folio back in an hour?

05:42.927 --> 05:47.098
I still want Penguin
to play out his hand, Robin.

05:47.265 --> 05:51.936
And I believe you'll find that the priceless folio
is upstairs in Bruce Wayne's study.

05:53.771 --> 05:55.356
I just came in, Ms. Gordon.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.942
I don't know if Mr. Wayne is here or--

05:58.109 --> 06:01.112
Oh, he just walked in. One moment, please.

06:01.279 --> 06:03.364
It's Ms. Gordon from the library, sir.

06:03.531 --> 06:05.283
And there's the priceless folio.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.952
A steal at $10,000.

06:08.119 --> 06:09.120
Hello, Ms. Gordon.

06:09.287 --> 06:13.207
Oh, Mr. Wayne, I'm glad I finally reached you.
I've been trying for over an hour.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.378
Dick and I were out
taking our usual early constitutional.

06:17.545 --> 06:21.549
Apparently Alfred didn't hear the telephone.
What can I do for you, Ms. Gordon?

06:21.716 --> 06:25.469
Well, completely against Batman's suggestion
and my father's advice...

06:25.636 --> 06:27.013
...I thought you should know.

06:27.179 --> 06:30.474
The priceless folio of famous parasols
we keep in a locked case...

06:30.641 --> 06:32.476
<i>...was stolen earlier this morning.</i>

06:32.643 --> 06:34.103
Yes, by the Penguin.

06:34.270 --> 06:37.023
He apparently made his entrance
with some sort of passkey...

06:37.189 --> 06:40.651
...and his exit through a window
by using his umbrella as a parachute.

06:40.818 --> 06:42.570
A man of many talents.

06:42.737 --> 06:44.405
You're not upset at such a loss?

06:44.780 --> 06:48.159
I'm not upset, Ms. Gordon,
because the priceless folio...

06:48.326 --> 06:50.828
...is, at this very moment,
on the desk in front of me.

06:50.995 --> 06:52.914
One second, please.

06:57.335 --> 07:01.213
Yes, Alfred tells me that Batman returned it
just a few minutes ago, Ms. Gordon.

07:01.380 --> 07:05.718
Oh, well, that's incredible. Batman
said he'd have it back within an hour, but--

07:05.885 --> 07:07.345
You didn't believe him?

07:07.678 --> 07:12.308
Well, I'm afraid I'm still naive enough
to believe the impossible can't be done.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.268
I guess I owe Batman an apology.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.896
A word of thanks should do
at the proper time.

07:17.063 --> 07:19.774
I'll see that the folio
is returned to the library shortly.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.902
<i>- Goodbye, Ms. Gordon.
- Good</i> bye.

07:26.155 --> 07:28.282
Good work, Mr. Fredd.

07:28.699 --> 07:31.702
I feel we're one step closer, Dick.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.245
One step closer?

07:33.412 --> 07:36.165
When you're now out $10,000
to that pompous purloiner?

07:36.332 --> 07:40.753
"Patient men win the day,"
an apt quotation from Chaucer.

07:40.920 --> 07:44.548
Apt maybe, but I doubt if Chaucer
had run into Penguin when he wrote it.

07:44.715 --> 07:48.052
<i>While back with the baleful bookie...</i>

07:48.219 --> 07:49.971
Those freeways are murder, boss.

07:50.137 --> 07:53.724
No explanations, no excuses,
and you shut up.

07:53.891 --> 07:56.435
I wanna see what the radio
has to say about this.

07:56.602 --> 07:58.437
<i>--Priceless folio of famous parasols...</i>

07:58.604 --> 08:02.233
<i>...stolen this morning from the Gotham Library
has been recovered by Batman...</i>

08:02.400 --> 08:05.444
<i>...and returned to Bruce Wayne,
chairman of the board of directors.</i>

08:05.611 --> 08:08.906
<i>Any further details are lacking at this time,
but Commissioner Gordon--</i>

08:09.073 --> 08:11.534
Returned already. Quadruple faugh.

08:11.701 --> 08:13.160
She is gonna pay for this.

08:13.661 --> 08:14.787
Who's she?

08:14.954 --> 08:17.915
Ms. Gordon, that's who.
She works at the library, doesn't she?

08:18.082 --> 08:20.084
She knows that that folio was stolen.

08:20.251 --> 08:24.255
She also happens to know Bruce Wayne,
who knows Batman...

08:24.422 --> 08:27.425
...who just might know A.L. Fredd.

08:27.591 --> 08:30.761
We got the 10 grand, Pengy.
Why ruffle your feathers?

08:30.928 --> 08:34.265
Because I smell a deep and dire plot
in all this.

08:34.432 --> 08:38.309
But Ms. Gordon is going to smell
something even worse.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.813
- What's that? Another radio?
-No, a little toy...

08:40.980 --> 08:43.691
...for the police commissioner's daughter.
-Does it walk?

08:44.066 --> 08:45.401
Of course it walks.

08:45.568 --> 08:48.821
And as it walks a little while,
it throws out a deadly gas...

08:48.988 --> 08:50.781
...on anybody who toys with it.

08:50.948 --> 08:53.242
Pengy, all we wanna do is win a horse race.

08:53.409 --> 08:54.785
We don't wanna kill anyone.

08:55.161 --> 08:58.456
She spurned me, didn't she?
Well, she's not gonna get a second chance.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.625
Take this over to
the police commissioner's daughter.

09:01.792 --> 09:04.295
- Tell her it's a gift from an admirer.
-Okay, boss.

09:04.462 --> 09:08.382
Visor, you go to the racetrack
and you get rid of this Wally Bootmaker.

09:08.549 --> 09:11.260
- I don't care how, just get rid of him.
-Right, Penguin.

09:11.427 --> 09:13.262
We'll follow with our dark horse.

09:13.429 --> 09:20.019
And while I am making the entries,
I want you to get rid of all the other horses.

09:20.186 --> 09:21.437
Me? How?

09:21.604 --> 09:25.483
Well, it's simple enough. They know you there.
Just apply plenty of this.

09:25.649 --> 09:26.650
Ha, ha, ha.

09:33.157 --> 09:35.367
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile at Gotham Park Racetrack...</i>

09:35.534 --> 09:39.997
<i>...the racing secretary has some startling news
for millionaire Bruce Wayne.</i>

09:40.414 --> 09:43.417
Every horse except Parasol
has been scratched?

09:43.584 --> 09:45.377
That's right, Mr. Wayne.

09:45.544 --> 09:47.254
And Wally Bootmaker has disappeared.

09:47.421 --> 09:50.966
And there's someone here
with a last-minute entry called Bumbershoot.

09:51.133 --> 09:53.094
Yes, he's in my office now.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.678
Well, he has his entry fee.

09:54.845 --> 09:57.431
- Says he's the owner-trainer.
-And jockey.

09:57.598 --> 09:58.849
What does he look like?

10:00.559 --> 10:02.853
Confidentially, he's a bit of a bird.

10:06.816 --> 10:09.193
Let him enter Bumbershoot.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.278
I'll get another jockey to ride Parasol.

10:11.445 --> 10:15.783
And there will be another last-minute entry
from the Bruce Wayne Stables.

10:15.950 --> 10:18.327
But don't say anything about it yet.

10:19.036 --> 10:23.749
Just as I thought. Penguin has not only
overplayed his hand, he's tipped his mitt.

10:23.916 --> 10:29.046
Somehow he's managed to switch horses
and put the big money on the wrong horse.

10:29.213 --> 10:31.215
Probably that goat from the glue factory.

10:31.382 --> 10:34.885
But what's this about another last-minute
entry from Wayne Stables?

10:35.052 --> 10:39.807
Waynebeau, my new 3-year-old, should win it.
I didn't wanna enter him earlier.

10:39.974 --> 10:43.060
I didn't want it to appear as if
I were setting up own my horse...

10:43.227 --> 10:45.312
...to win
the Bruce Wayne Foundation Handicap.

10:45.479 --> 10:46.981
Now, about jockeys...

10:47.148 --> 10:50.317
Bruce, let me ride Waynebeau.
I'm light enough.

10:51.110 --> 10:56.073
No, Dick, I couldn't allow my own ward
to ride my own thoroughbred.

10:56.240 --> 10:59.326
- People might think it was funny.
-Hm.

10:59.910 --> 11:04.290
But you can ride the fake Parasol
and try to win it.

11:04.456 --> 11:07.459
But if I did win,
wouldn't that upset all your plans?

11:07.626 --> 11:11.088
No, I'll get another jockey
to ride the other horse.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.882
Who?

11:13.591 --> 11:15.134
Well...

11:17.595 --> 11:19.972
No, I wouldn't even know
where to look for her.

11:20.139 --> 11:22.516
- Her?
-Batgirl.

11:24.268 --> 11:25.769
Gosh, yes, she'd be great.

11:25.936 --> 11:27.521
On our side and all.

11:27.688 --> 11:29.607
And all, Dick.

11:29.940 --> 11:33.110
But who is she and where is she?

11:33.277 --> 11:35.779
I wouldn't know
how to go about finding her.

11:38.657 --> 11:43.204
<i>So a short time later,
Barbara Gordon receives several surprises.</i>

11:43.370 --> 11:46.457
A little toy penguin. Oh, what a cute gadget.

11:46.624 --> 11:48.125
And look, it winds up.

11:48.292 --> 11:50.127
Oh, be careful, Myrtle.

11:50.294 --> 11:52.796
Oh, be careful
of a darling little thing like this?

11:53.380 --> 11:54.590
Whoa!

11:56.634 --> 11:59.261
Myrtle? Myrtle!

12:05.351 --> 12:08.812
<i>NARRATOR". And while Penguin's
pusillanimous plot proceeds...</i>

12:08.979 --> 12:12.566
<i>...Barbara gets a second surprise.</i>

12:13.067 --> 12:14.652
Oh, thank you.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.987
- Myrtle, are you all right?
-I think so.

12:17.154 --> 12:20.741
I only got a little whiff of that smoke,
but it certainly made me dizzy.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.369
You should lie down in the lounge.
I'll help you.

12:23.535 --> 12:26.288
Never mind, Barbara, I can make it.

12:27.039 --> 12:30.042
These diabolical tricks must be stopped.

12:30.209 --> 12:32.503
- I'm gonna call my father.
-Oh, one moment.

12:32.670 --> 12:37.174
I think this toy penguin has probably
breathed its last poisonous breath.

12:37.341 --> 12:41.220
And it's just possible
that a certain live Penguin...

12:41.387 --> 12:44.306
...may be rendered equally useless.

12:45.349 --> 12:47.726
Can we have a word together?

12:50.771 --> 12:53.274
<i>NARRATOR".
And speaking of words...</i>

12:53.440 --> 12:55.192
This is a farce, Mr. Wayne.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.820
An unknown jockey
on the horse that's the favorite?

12:57.987 --> 13:01.282
An unknown horse
with that birdman on board.

13:01.448 --> 13:05.327
<i>And your own entry, which even the touts
and tipsters haven't heard about yet.</i>

13:05.494 --> 13:08.038
<i>I demand that
the Wayne Foundation Memorial Handicap...</i>

13:08.205 --> 13:10.916
<i>-...be canceled this afternoon.
- Oh, you do?</i>

13:11.083 --> 13:15.254
Yes, as racing secretary of this meet,
I have a duty to owners, trainers, officials...

13:15.421 --> 13:17.548
...and track fans and myself.

13:17.715 --> 13:21.093
Why, if there were any logical explanation
for such a travesty...

13:21.260 --> 13:24.805
...if Batman, for instance,
told me that this race must be run...

13:24.972 --> 13:27.725
<i>...for a particular reason,
well, that might be different.</i>

13:27.891 --> 13:30.894
But just to satisfy a stubborn whim
of your own, Mr. Wayne...

13:31.061 --> 13:33.314
...as honorable a man as I know you are...

13:34.231 --> 13:37.276
And suppose Batman did tell you
that the race must be run?

13:38.235 --> 13:40.779
I would have to hear it from him in person.

13:43.407 --> 13:48.162
Hm. A very capable man,
the racing secretary.

13:48.329 --> 13:51.790
Remind me to give him a bonus, Alfred.
You say you talked to Batgirl.

13:51.957 --> 13:54.877
I did manage
to convey your message, sir, yes.

13:55.044 --> 13:57.755
Yes, would you convey a change
of Bruce Wayne's clothing...

13:57.921 --> 14:00.507
...to the governor's suite at the Turf Club?
-Yes, sir.

14:00.674 --> 14:05.846
While Batman conveys a message
to the racing secretary.

14:13.771 --> 14:18.275
<i>While an excited crowd awaits the running
of the Wayne Foundation Memorial Handicap...</i>

14:18.442 --> 14:22.112
<i>...the racing secretary hears
from Batman in person.</i>

14:22.279 --> 14:24.948
This race must be run.
When it's over, I'll tell you why.

14:25.115 --> 14:27.993
And I'm sure Mr. Wayne himself
will make a public announcement.

14:28.160 --> 14:31.955
Very well, Batman. I still think it's a farce,
but I'll bow to your judgment.

14:32.122 --> 14:35.125
<i>NARRATOR".
And Lola Lasagne meets her new jockey.</i>

14:35.292 --> 14:36.460
I wish you were Spanish.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.297
Oh, you are Spanish.
Do you speak Spanish?

14:41.632 --> 14:44.051
Good, it's nice to have
a Spanish-speaking jockey...

14:44.218 --> 14:45.969
...on a Spanish-speaking horse. Ha, ha.

14:47.554 --> 14:51.100
<i>NARRATOR".
And Penguin smells a rat.</i>

14:51.600 --> 14:56.897
That jockey, you know who he looks like?
Dick Grayson, Bruce Wayne's ward.

14:57.064 --> 15:00.317
What would Dick Grayson be doing
as a saddle monkey, boss?

15:00.484 --> 15:05.364
One thing he'll be doing soon
is eating my dust. Ha, ha, ha.

15:06.698 --> 15:09.201
Be a good girl, Parasol.

15:12.329 --> 15:15.124
You know who that kid is
up on that phony nag of yours?

15:15.290 --> 15:16.834
A darling Spanish boy.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.586
I'm so glad you hijacked Wally Bootmaker.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.255
He might have smelled a mouse.

15:21.422 --> 15:22.756
I smell a mousetrap.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.842
Did you put the bet down on Bumbershoot?

15:25.008 --> 15:26.176
I still have 10 minutes.

15:26.343 --> 15:27.553
Faugh, get going.

15:27.719 --> 15:30.848
Meet me outside the jockey room
right after the race.

15:31.014 --> 15:33.642
All right, ready?

15:38.647 --> 15:41.483
Never mind, I got it. Ha, ha, ha.

15:42.151 --> 15:43.986
<i>The horses are coming on the track...</i>

15:44.153 --> 15:48.198
<i>...with the $100,000
Wayne Foundation Memorial Handicap.</i>

15:48.365 --> 15:50.534
<i>One mile and one furlong.</i>

15:54.913 --> 16:00.377
<i>NARRATOR". But as the horses come out
on the track, what's this?</i>

16:00.544 --> 16:04.047
<i>Waynebeau making his surprise appearance.</i>

16:07.634 --> 16:12.055
<i>With a very surprising
saddle monkey aboard.</i>

16:12.222 --> 16:14.725
Who's that riding your horse,
Waynebeau, Mr. Wayne?

16:15.142 --> 16:16.643
It looks like...

16:16.810 --> 16:18.562
It is.

16:18.729 --> 16:21.565
That new crime-fighter
I've heard something about, Batgirl.

16:30.491 --> 16:32.910
Why, this is getting
more farcical by the moment.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.954
Let's just say there's a touch of irony in it.

16:36.413 --> 16:39.333
Well, Commissioner Gordon,
Chief O'Hara, won't you join us?

16:39.541 --> 16:43.670
Batman called me. He said something very
interesting might turn up here this afternoon...

16:43.837 --> 16:46.423
...so, Chief O'Hara and I better be on our toes.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.051
Good idea.

16:49.426 --> 16:50.928
Come on, chief.

16:55.098 --> 16:57.100
What is that third horse doing down there?

16:57.267 --> 16:59.269
A very late entry, madam.

16:59.436 --> 17:01.522
I believe he's called Waynebeau.

17:04.358 --> 17:07.109
Well, that looks like a girl riding it.

17:07.277 --> 17:08.278
Doesn't it, though?

17:10.948 --> 17:13.450
- I better go make my bet.
-Yeah.

17:20.749 --> 17:23.794
<i>ANNOUNCER".
It is now post time.</i>

17:26.672 --> 17:29.258
I want one $10,000 ticket
on number two, please.

17:29.424 --> 17:33.136
<i>Bumbershoot is not steady yet,
not straight. They're waiting on Bumbershoot.</i>

17:33.303 --> 17:35.472
<i>He stretches. The flag is up.</i>

17:36.807 --> 17:38.058
<i>There they go.</i>

17:38.642 --> 17:41.311
<i>Parasol is moving to the front...</i>

17:41.478 --> 17:44.147
<i>...Bumbershoot is second,
Waynebeau is third.</i>

17:44.314 --> 17:48.110
<i>Coming down the stretch the first time,
it's Parasol in front by two lengths.</i>

17:48.277 --> 17:50.988
<i>Bumbershoot is second,
two and a half lengths.</i>

17:51.154 --> 17:52.573
<i>Waynebeau on the inside.</i>

17:53.156 --> 17:54.825
<i>Passing the stand the first time...</i>

17:54.992 --> 17:57.452
<i>...it's Parasol in front
by two and a half lengths.</i>

17:57.619 --> 18:00.497
<i>Bumbershoot is second
by two lengths on the inside.</i>

18:00.664 --> 18:04.334
<i>Waynebeau looking for racing room.
There goes Waynebeau up on the inside.</i>

18:04.501 --> 18:06.670
<i>And Bumbershoot moves out.</i>

18:06.837 --> 18:10.507
<i>Around the clubhouse turn,
it's Bumbershoot on the outside in front...</i>

18:10.674 --> 18:13.218
<i>...and Waynebeau has moved up,
but is in tight quarters.</i>

18:13.385 --> 18:15.387
<i>And on the rail, Parasol.</i>

18:15.554 --> 18:19.391
<i>Into the back stretch,
it's Bumbershoot coming clear by four lengths.</i>

18:19.558 --> 18:22.269
<i>On the inside, Parasol and Waynebeau.</i>

18:22.436 --> 18:24.438
<i>It's Bumbershoot in front by two lengths...</i>

18:24.605 --> 18:26.857
<i>...and Parasol second
and Waynebeau coming out.</i>

18:27.024 --> 18:30.569
<i>Here comes Waynebeau moving to the outside.
And Waynebeau on the outside.</i>

18:30.736 --> 18:34.406
<i>Here comes Waynebeau to Bumbershoot.
It's Bumbershoot still in front.</i>

18:34.573 --> 18:38.285
<i>Holding on, on the outside,
Waynebeau, and Parasol is third.</i>

18:38.452 --> 18:40.746
<i>At the half mile, here's Bumbershoot in front.</i>

18:40.912 --> 18:44.875
<i>Now here comes Waynebeau on the outside,
is now coming in, taking the lead.</i>

18:45.042 --> 18:48.879
<i>It's Waynebeau on the outside. Parasol
moving on the inside, but can't find room.</i>

18:49.046 --> 18:51.131
<i>It's Waynebeau. Waynebeau coming clear.</i>

18:51.298 --> 18:53.800
<i>Bumbershoot is second,
Parasol is far behind.</i>

18:53.967 --> 18:56.303
<i>It's Waynebeau in front,
Waynebeau on the inside...</i>

18:56.470 --> 18:59.473
<i>...and Bumbershoot again trying to challenge.
Parasol is third.</i>

18:59.806 --> 19:02.934
<i>Waynebeau is looking for room,
comes on out and comes to the leader.</i>

19:03.101 --> 19:04.936
<i>It's Waynebeau coming clear.</i>

19:05.103 --> 19:08.106
<i>It's Waynebeau now in front by one
and Parasol is on the outside.</i>

19:08.482 --> 19:11.068
<i>It's Waynebeau. And now Bumbershoot again.
Waynebeau.</i>

19:11.234 --> 19:12.903
<i>And Waynebeau is flying.</i>

19:13.070 --> 19:15.197
<i>There goes Waynebeau flying away.</i>

19:15.364 --> 19:17.074
<i>Waynebeau wins it easily.</i>

19:17.240 --> 19:20.577
<i>Bumbershoot is second, Parasol is third.</i>

19:34.174 --> 19:36.385
<i>Hold your tickets. Please, hold all tickets...</i>

19:36.551 --> 19:39.930
<i>...until the result of the race
has been declared official.</i>

19:40.097 --> 19:41.306
My word.

19:48.730 --> 19:51.316
You may have a good-sized riot
on your hands, Mr. Wayne.

19:51.483 --> 19:54.111
Almost everyone bet on Parasol.

19:54.277 --> 19:56.905
Batman better have a good explanation too.

19:57.072 --> 19:58.115
I'm sure he will.

20:05.497 --> 20:10.293
It's a very dark day for racing
in Gotham City, Mr. Wayne.

20:11.503 --> 20:13.296
Mr. Wayne?

20:14.089 --> 20:15.382
Mr. Wayne?

20:18.218 --> 20:20.220
I'll change, then we better make tracks.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.180
Why? We haven't done anything wrong.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.891
We haven't done anything right.
We just lost 10 grand.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.978
And the paint is running faster
than the horse did.

20:31.732 --> 20:34.151
You can't go in there. You're a woman.

20:38.572 --> 20:40.574
No need to change clothes, Penguin.

20:40.991 --> 20:43.827
They'll issue you a nice striped wardrobe
where you're going.

20:43.994 --> 20:47.914
Faugh. Armband, Visor, bridle that filly.

20:58.341 --> 21:00.844
Help, reserves! Reserves!

21:01.011 --> 21:03.638
Your odds haven't been too good
this afternoon, Penguin.

21:03.805 --> 21:06.683
But five men against one girl is ridiculous.

21:06.850 --> 21:09.227
Oh, I'm enjoying this. Don't bother.

21:09.686 --> 21:12.939
No bother to return the many favors
you've done for us, Batgirl.

21:13.356 --> 21:14.399
Mash them!

21:44.846 --> 21:47.516
Well, Penguin, looks like
your perfidious prank is up.

21:47.682 --> 21:53.063
Perfidious? Faugh, I admit I fixed the race,
but I fixed it so the best horse won.

21:53.230 --> 21:56.233
Regardless of that,
I'm sure that the results of the Handicap...

21:56.399 --> 21:58.652
...will be declared permanently unofficial.

21:58.819 --> 22:01.905
And you'll be declared
permanently incarcerated.

22:02.072 --> 22:05.200
- You too, Lulu Schultz.
-Lulu Schultz?

22:05.367 --> 22:09.037
- I am Senora Lola Lasagne.
-Lasa-- Ha, ha.

22:09.204 --> 22:11.665
In a penguin's tailfeather.
Ha, ha, ha.

22:11.832 --> 22:14.251
- All right, come on, come on, let's go.
-You too.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.878
Oh, yeah, thataway.

22:17.796 --> 22:20.382
Batgirl, she's gone again.

22:20.757 --> 22:22.467
Like spray.

22:22.634 --> 22:24.261
Like a cloud.

22:24.427 --> 22:26.054
Like lightning.

22:26.221 --> 22:28.682
We should try to find her and thank her.

22:29.432 --> 22:32.853
Mere thanks are empty words, Robin.

22:33.436 --> 22:38.567
Whoever she is, wherever she goes,
whatever she's after...

22:38.733 --> 22:41.444
...I think we'll be seeing more of her.

22:49.619 --> 22:51.454
A little dusty, Barbara?

22:51.621 --> 22:52.664
Oh, hi, Daddy.

22:52.831 --> 22:56.209
I was just trying to spruce up
the Egyptology section of the library...

22:56.376 --> 22:59.838
...but the sands of time
seemed to have pretty well buried it.

23:00.005 --> 23:02.966
I was going to call you at your office,
but I haven't had time.

23:03.133 --> 23:05.927
I haven't been at the office,
I've been at the races.

23:06.094 --> 23:08.638
Races? The police commissioner?

23:08.805 --> 23:12.350
All in the line of duty, Barbara,
and it paid off.

23:12.517 --> 23:15.979
The Penguin and a female cohort
tried to fix the Bruce Wayne Handicap...

23:16.146 --> 23:18.106
...but we fixed them.

23:18.273 --> 23:23.194
So to celebrate, I thought I would take
my favorite librarian out on the town tonight.

23:23.361 --> 23:26.323
Your favorite librarian would love it.
Just let me freshen up a little bit.

23:27.657 --> 23:30.368
What's the matter? King Tut.

23:34.831 --> 23:38.835
I didn't expect to turn up a pharaoh in here.
Where did he go?

23:39.002 --> 23:43.506
Well, you can never tell about King Tut,
my dear, but I better alert Batman.

23:43.673 --> 23:46.760
You mean, a real arch-criminal
has turned up here in the library?

23:46.927 --> 23:49.721
Well, part of him anyway.
He's a split personality.

23:49.888 --> 23:52.182
A modern-day Yale professor
some of the time.

23:52.349 --> 23:53.558
And the rest of the time?

23:53.725 --> 23:56.478
A reincarnated Egyptian despot.

23:56.645 --> 23:59.898
Old as the pyramids, wise as the sphinx.

24:00.065 --> 24:02.025
- Oh, he sounds fascinating.
-Uh-uh.

24:02.192 --> 24:03.902
No, darling, not fascinating.

24:04.069 --> 24:09.532
He is fiendishly evil,
the most dangerous kind of fraud.

24:09.699 --> 24:12.702
I better get word to the dynamic duo.

24:14.245 --> 24:19.084
<i>NARRATOR". So, King Tut has returned,
but for what evil purpose?</i>

24:19.250 --> 24:21.211
<i>With what nefarious scheme?</i>

24:21.378 --> 24:23.672
<i>And what is he doing in this library?</i>

24:23.838 --> 24:27.509
<i>Watch the next episode
for the awesome answer.</i>
