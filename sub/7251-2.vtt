01:00.791 --> 01:02.690
- I've got too much stuff. 
- What?

01:03.206 --> 01:04.840
Stuff! And it's your fault.

01:05.102 --> 01:08.201
You inculcated into me a tolerance for rampant consumerism.

01:08.377 --> 01:08.982
What?

01:09.370 --> 01:12.317
When did I become one of those girls with dozens of beauty products,

01:12.413 --> 01:13.764
none of which are expendable?

01:13.918 --> 01:15.464
It used to be a touch of mascara,

01:15.556 --> 01:17.445
dab of Coppertone, zip, bam, boom, out the door.

01:17.706 --> 01:19.095
I heard copper and boom.

01:19.206 --> 01:22.094
Never mind. And what's going on? We're late.

01:22.279 --> 01:23.451
I'm looking for the camera.

01:23.615 --> 01:25.366
Oy vey, she's looking for the camera.

01:25.479 --> 01:27.307
- I heard that. 
- That she hears.

01:27.685 --> 01:31.255
It is my prerogative as your mother to record any event in my daughter's life

01:31.361 --> 01:33.517
that I so choose. It's in the mother's handbook.

01:33.815 --> 01:35.551
Does Luke know that you can't drive a stick?

01:35.688 --> 01:36.190
Why?

01:36.466 --> 01:38.376
Because you borrowed his truck and it's a stick.

01:39.046 --> 01:39.825
I can drive a stick.

01:40.025 --> 01:41.960
You can stir coffee with a stick, but you can't drive a stick.

01:42.794 --> 01:46.040
Okay, I am glad I did not choose to record that particular moment

01:46.118 --> 01:47.720
in my daughter's life 'cause that was just ugly.

01:47.838 --> 01:49.174
I just want you to get there in one piece.

01:49.599 --> 01:51.611
- You look out for me. 
- Let's hit the road.

01:53.476 --> 01:57.212
Oh, wait, wait, this is it! This is the precise moment that I've been looking for.

01:57.299 --> 01:59.225
This is my daughter going off to college, this is my shot!

02:00.054 --> 02:00.868
Okay, fine.

02:02.010 --> 02:03.612
Okay, I'm lining you up, now look candid.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.486
Okay, see, the very definition of candid means

02:05.584 --> 02:07.310
that the subject doesn't know the picture's being taken.

02:07.411 --> 02:09.404
- So forget the camera's there. 
- I'll try.

02:09.622 --> 02:11.298
- And smile. 
- Okay, okay.

02:12.997 --> 02:15.496
- I'm not happy. 
- Why?

02:15.613 --> 02:18.057
- It looks posed. 
- How about this?

02:18.660 --> 02:20.346
Yeah, you know the stick we were talking about before?

02:20.697 --> 02:22.157
It looks like it's somewhere else now.

02:22.342 --> 02:24.303
You're having serious Annie Leibovitz delusions here.

02:24.396 --> 02:25.972
But it just looks like you're standing in the house.

02:26.079 --> 02:27.775
No one will know that you're going off to college.

02:27.943 --> 02:28.742
Shall I hold a sign?

02:28.916 --> 02:30.370
Or you could do the "going off to college" walk.

02:30.703 --> 02:32.254
- The what? 
- The walk, the this.

02:34.098 --> 02:36.283
You look like Alfalfa coming to pick up Darla.

02:36.376 --> 02:39.370
Here, hold some of your stuff. At least it'll look like you're moving or something.

02:40.559 --> 02:42.197
It looks like you're taking out the trash.

02:42.704 --> 02:43.677
Okay, that's it, we're going.

02:44.281 --> 02:47.358
All right. I'll just have to make do with one of the pictures I already took.

02:47.461 --> 02:48.116
Good.

02:48.362 --> 02:51.311
I'll put it on the computer and then superimpose an important person

02:51.387 --> 02:53.738
standing next to you seeing you off, like Kissinger

02:53.800 --> 02:56.017
or Lady Bird Johnson or Pat Summerall or something.

02:56.165 --> 02:56.928
Pat Summerall?

02:57.108 --> 02:58.434
You think of somebody better.

02:58.663 --> 03:00.584
- Orson Welles. 
- It can't be a dead person.

03:00.819 --> 03:02.938
- Pat Summerall's dead. 
- No, he's not.

03:03.046 --> 03:04.546
Pat Summerall is dead.

03:04.721 --> 03:06.871
No, I'm telling you, he's not.

03:07.009 --> 03:09.282
- Lady Bird Johnson is dead. 
- No, she's not.

03:09.403 --> 03:10.665
- How much you wanna bet? 
- Five bucks.

03:10.778 --> 03:12.764
- Let's google him right now. 
- Mom, Yale?

03:12.893 --> 03:14.673
Yeah, Yale can wait for us to google Pat Summerall.

03:14.862 --> 03:15.390
Come.

03:15.590 --> 03:16.599
Where are your priorities?

04:14.896 --> 04:15.546
Hey, Luke.

04:15.966 --> 04:17.737
Hey, Rory. Isn't today Yale?

04:18.029 --> 04:19.801
Yeah, I'm going right now.

04:19.983 --> 04:21.470
You look so calm. How do you feel?

04:21.612 --> 04:24.541
A little nervous, but a last Luke's fix before I go will help.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.614
Well, today is whatever you want on the house.

04:26.718 --> 04:27.798
Wow, I feel important.

04:27.932 --> 04:29.785
You are important. Where's your mom?

04:30.354 --> 04:33.799
She's coming. She's having a wee bit of trouble with your truck.

04:36.001 --> 04:37.286
What is she doing?

04:37.916 --> 04:41.232
Well, she backed the truck out of our driveway all fine and everything,

04:41.304 --> 04:43.774
but once she hit the road, she couldn't get it out of reverse, so she...

04:43.859 --> 04:44.566
Backed it here?

04:46.108 --> 04:46.897
Slow but steady.

04:49.579 --> 04:50.873
Something's wrong with your truck.

04:50.987 --> 04:52.636
Nothing's wrong with my truck. Stop the truck.

04:52.753 --> 04:54.581
- It won't go out of reverse. 
- You can't drive a stick.

04:54.724 --> 04:56.272
I can't drive an uncooperative stick.

04:56.353 --> 04:58.206
My stick's not uncooperative. Come on, hit the brakes.

05:01.836 --> 05:03.982
Okay, good luck.

05:05.052 --> 05:07.243
I don't think it's gonna happen.

05:09.512 --> 05:11.713
- This is a misogynistic truck! 
- What?

05:12.174 --> 05:14.462
It's anti-woman, it's gender-selective,

05:14.528 --> 05:18.830
it's "Oh, let's drink a beer and watch the game and hike our shorts up."

05:19.699 --> 05:22.393
I changed my mind, you can't borrow my truck.

05:22.691 --> 05:24.810
- But it's full of our stuff. 
- You should've hired movers.

05:24.923 --> 05:26.648
You could've said no when I asked to borrow the truck.

05:26.725 --> 05:30.100
- You said you could drive a stick. 
- Yeah, not the Joe Sixpack of sticks.

05:30.298 --> 05:35.444
Not the "Oh, let's scratch our bellies and eat some corn nuts and pick our teeth."

05:37.145 --> 05:39.598
- Really, Luke, I can drive it. 
- Okay, fine.

05:39.847 --> 05:42.316
Just be careful and have it back by four.

05:42.536 --> 05:45.172
- Four-ish it is. 
- Four, I need it at four.

05:45.295 --> 05:46.815
- Give or take a few min... 
- Four.

05:46.989 --> 05:50.123
- God, he's so possessive about the stupid truck. 
- It's my truck, I possess it!

05:50.200 --> 05:52.673
I'm just kidding. I'll have it back by four, calm down.

05:52.786 --> 05:53.616
Okay, I'm just...

05:54.471 --> 05:56.866
I'm not in much of a kidding mood with all this other stuff going on.

05:56.938 --> 05:59.872
- Divorce papers. Fun, huh? 
- Zero fun. Sorry, Luke.

05:59.955 --> 06:01.731
It's not that I wasn't expecting them, it's just...

06:02.242 --> 06:04.393
the law firm that Nicole works for sent them.

06:04.454 --> 06:06.523
I called with a simple question they could've answered over the phone,

06:06.610 --> 06:09.053
but they insisted on sending someone down to see me.

06:09.208 --> 06:10.455
I take it you're not looking forward to that.

06:10.543 --> 06:11.740
I'm about to build a moat of fire.

06:12.318 --> 06:13.865
- Here you go, Rory. 
- Thanks, Caesar.

06:14.536 --> 06:16.788
Since we were short on time, I had them make us something to go.

06:16.968 --> 06:19.082
- My Yale special. 
- Oh, share, share.

06:19.159 --> 06:22.340
Sausage wrapped in a pancake tied together with bacon.

06:22.436 --> 06:23.865
- You made that up? 
- I don't know how I do it.

06:24.510 --> 06:25.602
- Here. 
- What's this?

06:25.718 --> 06:29.829
A shift diagram for the truck, nice and simple. D is for drive, R is for...

06:29.917 --> 06:31.703
- The R in drive! 
- R is for reverse.

06:31.796 --> 06:33.234
- Right, reverse. 
- And one is...

06:33.332 --> 06:34.417
The loneliest number that you'll ever know!

06:34.592 --> 06:35.456
The first gear.

06:35.550 --> 06:38.089
- I know, Luke. Really, I can handle it. 
- I hope so.

06:38.432 --> 06:39.025
Thanks, Luke.

06:39.455 --> 06:40.315
Good luck, Rory.

06:41.626 --> 06:44.135
- Oh, goody, a guy in a suit. 
- Good luck to you.

06:46.127 --> 06:48.083
- Mr. Danes? 
- Unfortunately.

06:48.175 --> 06:51.052
I'm Russell Bynes. I'm with Blodgett, Sage, Albet, Pettruccio,

06:51.128 --> 06:53.807
Stein, Lemming, and Stein, attorneys for Nicole Diana Leahy.

06:53.889 --> 06:55.665
And the sun just went down, thanks for coming.

06:55.773 --> 06:57.207
- Pardon me? 
- You're wasting your time.

06:57.345 --> 07:01.308
I had a simple question, where do I sign? It didn't require a personal visit.

07:01.395 --> 07:04.185
Whoa, there's no place to sign because this is just a document

07:04.257 --> 07:06.571
informing the defendant of the type of action being filed.

07:06.673 --> 07:07.995
What are you talking about? Who's the defendant?

07:08.097 --> 07:09.367
- You are. 
- Oh my God.

07:09.464 --> 07:10.253
Didn't you read the papers?

07:10.360 --> 07:13.597
Yeah, the Red Sox lost by three, Bush is at the ranch chatting up a Swiss dude.

07:13.679 --> 07:15.372
- The divorce papers. 
- I know what you meant.

07:15.481 --> 07:18.630
Look, I didn't kill anyone. Nicole and I just kind of accidentally got married

07:18.758 --> 07:20.662
and now we want out. We both want the same thing.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.735
- Don't try to play me, Mr. Danes. 
- I'm too busy for this.

07:22.878 --> 07:25.254
Fine, because I should just be dealing with your legal representation.

07:26.319 --> 07:27.512
I don't believe this.

07:27.646 --> 07:30.573
Not giving us your lawyer's information is only going to prolong the process.

07:30.635 --> 07:32.607
Okay, if I give you my lawyer's name, will you leave?

07:32.734 --> 07:34.066
- I will leave. 
- Okay, you ready?

07:34.272 --> 07:36.504
His name is Don Dewey. He works at the firm of Dewey...

07:36.657 --> 07:37.325
- Dewey. 
- Cheatham...

07:37.431 --> 07:38.407
- Cheatham. 
- And Howe.

07:38.503 --> 07:39.801
Dewey, Cheatham, and Howe.

07:43.062 --> 07:45.632
- That was very immature. 
- Yeah, well, tickled me.

07:45.739 --> 07:47.097
My bosses are gonna wanna hear this.

07:47.244 --> 07:48.657
Oh, come on, they've heard that one before.

07:48.883 --> 07:53.584
Oh, hey, if you want Don's number, it's 555-5555.

07:55.755 --> 07:57.686
- I thought you were gone. 
- Nothing's where it says it is.

07:59.744 --> 08:00.783
It's gonna be fine.

08:18.856 --> 08:21.411
- Nice score! 
- Thank you.

08:22.139 --> 08:25.318
Oh, and later, I'll point out the seven or so fellow Yalies

08:25.427 --> 08:27.531
who already hate you because your obnoxious mother

08:27.622 --> 08:29.936
wouldn't let them park in the only open spot left.

08:30.014 --> 08:31.529
Oh, goody. You get the truck here okay?

08:31.646 --> 08:33.542
Oh, we had some bickering, but we made it.

08:34.048 --> 08:34.953
Hello. Name?

08:35.097 --> 08:38.354
Oh, hey. I was told it was okay to hold the spot.

08:38.554 --> 08:42.640
A guy told me, I forget his name. He had, like, a jacket.

08:42.741 --> 08:44.867
It's okay. I was just wondering what our newcomer's name is.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.347
- Rory Gilmore. 
- Right, Rory Gilmore

08:46.751 --> 08:49.398
Rory Gilmore, Rory Gilmore... there you are.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.840
- Welcome to Yale. 
- Oh, hold the shake, hold the shake.

08:51.983 --> 08:53.234
- Mom. 
- Wait, lens cap, lens cap.

08:53.396 --> 08:54.882
- Sorry. 
- They all do this.

08:55.015 --> 08:55.564
Shake.

08:56.182 --> 08:57.779
Got it. Who are you?

08:57.939 --> 08:59.623
I'm Tess, I'm Rory's freshman counselor.

08:59.726 --> 09:01.707
I'll be living in the building and be there for whatever she needs.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.969
And you look twenty-one, convenient for beer runs.

09:04.129 --> 09:06.198
I'll be giving a tour for Durfee girls you should not miss.

09:06.351 --> 09:09.950
Oh, I know. Tour's at twelve, followed by the optional express lunch twelve to two,

09:10.031 --> 09:11.814
which is all followed by the telecommunications orientation

09:11.900 --> 09:15.606
and internet ID distribution, parents' reception eleven to one.

09:15.684 --> 09:17.148
You memorized the schedule.

09:17.281 --> 09:19.310
Yeah, she's not weird or anything, she just has a good memory.

09:19.422 --> 09:20.728
And I see you brought your own mattress.

09:20.841 --> 09:22.939
Oh, right. See, the guy...

09:23.682 --> 09:25.443
name, name, name. I forget his name.

09:25.694 --> 09:30.087
Three syllables. He said it was okay, and he had, like, a mustache.

09:30.194 --> 09:32.078
It's allowed as long as you make arrangements to dispose

09:32.161 --> 09:33.805
of the one that was already there. Did you do that?

09:33.942 --> 09:35.156
- Yes, we did. 
- Yes.

09:35.396 --> 09:37.060
- Good. Get your camera ready. 
- Why?

09:37.249 --> 09:39.466
- I'm giving Rory her key. 
- Thanks for the warning.

09:42.058 --> 09:44.023
- See you at the tour. 
- Yes, Tess, thank you.

09:44.816 --> 09:46.129
So, she's nice.

09:46.302 --> 09:49.001
Yeah. I'm dying to see your room. Come on, grab a bag.

09:49.385 --> 09:51.396
So, you made arrangements to get rid of the old mattress?

09:51.494 --> 09:53.214
- Yes, I did. 
- Really?

09:54.855 --> 09:58.195
Because it specifically says here that you're supposed to make arrangements

09:58.294 --> 10:00.571
to have the old mattress picked up before arrival.

10:00.685 --> 10:02.369
Ooh, very grand.

10:03.208 --> 10:05.006
So, what time are the mattress guys coming?

10:05.194 --> 10:06.357
Later today sometime.

10:06.455 --> 10:07.909
So we have to wait in the room for them, or...

10:08.016 --> 10:09.736
I think they just let themselves in. Here we are.

10:10.197 --> 10:12.036
So do the mattress guys have their own key?

10:12.122 --> 10:13.665
All right, I confess, I didn't call the mattress guys.

10:14.433 --> 10:16.689
- What are we gonna do? 
- We'll find a dumpster.

10:16.915 --> 10:18.481
Mom, they could trace it back to me.

10:18.625 --> 10:20.305
- I'll be long gone by then. 
- Mom.

10:20.637 --> 10:25.092
All right, we'll burn it before we dump it. A match, a little gasoline.

10:25.302 --> 10:27.605
We're here five minutes and we're already contemplating felonies.

10:30.105 --> 10:31.314
Just like I pictured it.

10:31.763 --> 10:33.177
Did you see an emergency exit?

10:33.406 --> 10:35.833
A fireplace, too! I wonder if it's woodburning.

10:36.008 --> 10:39.654
It says here, "Upon arrival, please take note of the emergency exits."

10:39.771 --> 10:42.408
Hey, hey, we could burn the mattress in there, save us a trip.

10:42.608 --> 10:44.871
Man, a piece of my map ripped off.

10:44.958 --> 10:45.874
Which one's your room?

10:45.981 --> 10:47.538
I'm missing half of the Old Campus.

10:47.610 --> 10:48.951
R.G. This is it.

10:49.105 --> 10:51.701
If I have Old Campus activities today, I'm screwed.

10:53.765 --> 10:54.809
Here it is.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.557
Here's where you're going to be thinking all those impressive thoughts.

10:58.879 --> 11:01.255
It's just waiting for your decorative stamp.

11:01.608 --> 11:03.934
- And a little air freshener. 
- Where's the phone jack?

11:04.356 --> 11:06.396
I don't know, Jack. Where is the pesky phone?

11:06.656 --> 11:07.255
Mom.

11:07.721 --> 11:08.786
You're one-note Nancy today.

11:08.986 --> 11:11.265
Ah, here's a place to get replacement maps.

11:11.638 --> 11:13.814
Holy cow, it's in Old Campus!

11:14.163 --> 11:15.903
All right, that's it.

11:16.563 --> 11:18.028
- Hey, what are you doing? 
- You just missed it.

11:18.280 --> 11:19.026
Missed what?

11:19.175 --> 11:21.315
Walking into your dorm suite for the first time. Do over.

11:21.510 --> 11:24.644
What? We're short on time here and we haven't unloaded.

11:24.770 --> 11:26.282
It doesn't matter. You're gonna be in the moment.

11:26.363 --> 11:26.967
Mom.

11:27.091 --> 11:29.682
You're gonna be in the moment or the rest of the map gets it.

11:30.163 --> 11:32.379
No. Okay, I'm here, I swear.

11:32.626 --> 11:33.686
You're not placating me?

11:34.570 --> 11:37.009
I'll try. Really, I'm all here.

11:37.178 --> 11:37.653
Good.

11:38.084 --> 11:39.799
Oh, here's your suite.

11:40.197 --> 11:41.022
Cool.

11:46.366 --> 11:48.918
It is cool. My own space.

11:49.199 --> 11:52.082
Well, yours and P.G.'s and J.B.'s and T.S.'s.

11:52.174 --> 11:53.546
And a fireplace. Did you see the fireplace?

11:54.021 --> 11:55.706
Was this do over justified or what?

11:58.661 --> 11:59.807
You mentioned thoughts in here?

12:00.167 --> 12:01.451
All the great ones you're gonna have.

12:01.574 --> 12:02.776
- And air freshener? 
- That, too.

12:03.202 --> 12:04.436
Thanks for putting me in the moment.

12:05.260 --> 12:05.967
My pleasure.

12:06.208 --> 12:07.595
It's something I would have not wanted to miss.

12:07.692 --> 12:08.169
Good.

12:09.013 --> 12:10.846
- And thank you. 
- For what?

12:10.928 --> 12:13.391
For pretending that you're not at this moment thinking about missing your tour,

12:13.499 --> 12:15.639
finding your phone jack, navigating the Old Campus.

12:15.808 --> 12:16.597
It's my gift to you.

12:16.725 --> 12:19.203
- Let's go unload and get you a new map. 
- Bless you.

12:28.152 --> 12:32.447
Just keep in mind, guys, the dining hall hours are cast in stone - you snooze, you lose.

12:32.530 --> 12:35.248
And it's a post-9/11 world, so your ID's are important.

12:35.505 --> 12:39.130
You'll be asked for it a lot, so always have it, always, always.

12:39.299 --> 12:42.976
It also operates the laundry machines and is also your meal card.

12:43.077 --> 12:46.554
That's right, it's practically magic, so don't lose it.

12:46.901 --> 12:49.564
If you're stupid enough to get ripped, I'm here to help,

12:49.641 --> 12:52.135
but I do not hold buckets, if you get my drift.

12:52.335 --> 12:56.322
Now, pay attention to street parking, it is severely restricted in most places.

12:56.527 --> 12:58.248
Walk or take the shuttle when you can.

12:58.574 --> 12:59.559
First floor Durfee.

12:59.687 --> 13:00.484
Third floor Bingham.

13:00.706 --> 13:01.853
- They're babies. 
- Tots.

13:02.232 --> 13:04.356
Third floor Bingham, through the gate, make a left.

13:05.222 --> 13:08.242
Get an internet ID whether you think you'll use it or not.

13:08.340 --> 13:12.917
It'll be your name at yale.edu, and there's no changing what you get.

13:12.999 --> 13:14.273
Think there's gonna be a test?

13:14.540 --> 13:15.579
Probably not.

13:17.015 --> 13:19.035
Oh, you were joking. Good one.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.002
No bottlenecks, girls.

13:21.130 --> 13:23.824
There's about a hundred behind you waiting for the same stuff.

13:24.089 --> 13:26.679
Do not get precious about your ID pictures.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.375
They are what they are.

13:28.578 --> 13:30.935
Did you get that down? They are what they are.

13:31.046 --> 13:32.244
- I'll remember. 
- Next!

13:32.640 --> 13:33.915
- That would be you. 
- What?

13:34.078 --> 13:35.828
- It's picture time. 
- Oh, sorry.

13:36.808 --> 13:40.069
I didn't think pictures were today. Do you mind if I take a second to...

13:40.166 --> 13:40.852
One thousand and one.

13:41.144 --> 13:42.035
Next!

13:45.096 --> 13:49.121
Always have your keys. Never open the door to someone you don't know.

13:49.198 --> 13:52.782
Walk in twos at night. That's it, any questions?

13:54.339 --> 13:56.699
Later on, you'll have questions.

13:56.955 --> 13:57.805
I'll be around.

13:58.558 --> 13:59.776
Now go do stuff.

14:28.454 --> 14:29.518
Rory, you back?

14:38.419 --> 14:39.973
- Who is that? 
- I don't know.

14:40.342 --> 14:43.304
She just followed me in here like a puppy dog without saying a word.

14:43.501 --> 14:44.284
Maybe she's lost.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.552
Or maybe she's one of my new suitemates who I'm already off to a swell start with.

14:47.643 --> 14:49.409
Do you know how vulnerable you are to venereal disease?

14:49.737 --> 14:51.560
All hail to the queen of the non-sequiturs.

14:51.653 --> 14:53.926
This parent orientation I went to was a nonstop litany

14:53.981 --> 14:55.559
of the horrors awaiting college freshman.

14:55.697 --> 14:58.181
You're supposed to carry a whistle, a flashlight, a crucifix,

14:58.339 --> 14:59.859
and a loaded Glock with you at all times.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.304
We should go out there. She'll think we're hiding.

15:01.426 --> 15:03.306
Okay, just don't shake hands with her. Bacteria.

15:03.402 --> 15:03.833
Mom.

15:04.007 --> 15:05.390
- Or tell her where you live. 
- Too late.

15:05.497 --> 15:07.028
- Oh, you touched the doorknob. 
- Good grief.

15:09.766 --> 15:11.238
- Say something. 
- What?

15:11.405 --> 15:12.547
Anything. Go, go.

15:20.002 --> 15:22.544
- I'm adopted. 
- You're up.

15:24.361 --> 15:25.973
- What's your name? 
- Tanna Schrick.

15:26.131 --> 15:27.426
Well, Tanna Schrick, good.

15:27.585 --> 15:28.962
We're making some progress. Hi, Tanna Schrick.

15:29.090 --> 15:31.128
I'm Lorelai, this is Rory. She'll be living here, too.

15:31.271 --> 15:32.142
We're suitemates.

15:32.429 --> 15:35.531
As they're ransacking your room, professional thieves typically start

15:35.623 --> 15:38.321
at the bottom drawer and work their way up. That way they don't have

15:38.378 --> 15:40.856
to close drawers before opening the next one. Saves time.

15:40.946 --> 15:43.855
Okay. So, no storing your valuables in the bottom drawer.

15:43.918 --> 15:45.792
Got that, Rory? Good tip, Tanna. Thanks.

15:45.893 --> 15:47.480
I'm not so great at extemporaneous speaking,

15:47.589 --> 15:50.904
so I've memorized some quick conversational facts I can whip out at a moment's notice.

15:51.005 --> 15:53.845
Oh, when I get to know you better, I'll memorize some facts

15:53.936 --> 15:55.386
that are more specific to your person.

15:55.519 --> 15:57.251
- Tanna, how old are you? 
- Sixteen.

15:57.404 --> 15:58.874
- Sixteen? 
- On Tuesday.

15:59.016 --> 16:00.747
- Happy birthday, Doogie. 
- Thank you.

16:01.356 --> 16:02.698
And, where are your parents?

16:02.820 --> 16:06.087
Oh, at the hotel. Mom's napping, Dad's getting a schvitz.

16:06.532 --> 16:08.744
Okay, well, we still have some more stuff to do,

16:08.785 --> 16:11.494
but maybe your parents will be here when I get back. I'd love to meet them.

16:11.633 --> 16:14.224
Yeah, well, they make a very good first impression.

16:14.372 --> 16:16.537
I'm sure they do. See you later, kiddo.

16:17.184 --> 16:17.715
Bye.

16:18.330 --> 16:20.936
- Oh, hey, Rory? 
- Yeah?

16:21.586 --> 16:22.190
You nervous?

16:22.783 --> 16:25.109
- Oh yeah. 
- Okay, good.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.994
- Odd, but nice. 
- I'll take it.

16:33.561 --> 16:36.186
- So... this is it. 
- This is it.

16:37.191 --> 16:38.989
- Learn a lot of stuff. 
- I'll try.

16:39.352 --> 16:41.841
And, you know, keep in touch.

16:42.604 --> 16:44.452
We'll at least exchange Christmas cards.

16:44.847 --> 16:46.751
With a letter detailing what's happened over the year.

16:46.858 --> 16:48.102
- And a current photo. 
- Don't joke!

16:48.276 --> 16:49.915
- You started it. 
- I was masking my pain.

16:50.074 --> 16:51.928
- You'll see plenty of me. 
- It's not enough.

16:52.029 --> 16:52.644
How about tons?

16:53.207 --> 16:55.476
That's better. I love you, did you know that?

16:55.739 --> 16:57.062
I always suspected it.

16:59.142 --> 17:00.337
Oh, excuse me. 

17:01.142 --> 17:03.737
- A little fridge. 
- It's cute.

17:04.630 --> 17:06.874
- I want one. 
- Go get yourself one.

17:06.984 --> 17:08.951
- For you, I want one for you. 
- I don't need one.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.520
For sodas and stuff when things are closed. Late night cram sessions.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.056
I guess it would come in handy.

17:14.246 --> 17:15.659
Oh, let's see what these people have going on.

17:15.756 --> 17:16.185
Mom.

17:17.670 --> 17:21.173
A rug! A rug for your room to make it cozy.

17:21.422 --> 17:24.730
- And a vase of flowers. 
- The flowers will just die.

17:24.818 --> 17:27.244
They have a vase of the most beautiful fake flowers I've ever seen.

17:27.451 --> 17:29.554
- Trash cans! 
- Oh, you're right.

17:29.646 --> 17:32.084
- And a fan. I have been remiss. 
- No, you haven't.

17:32.190 --> 17:33.477
I have got another trip to make today.

17:33.563 --> 17:34.875
No, Mom, you've done enough today.

17:34.982 --> 17:38.167
I want you fully outfitted and settled for your first night or I won't sleep.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.841
- We can get it all later. 
- No, no.

17:39.959 --> 17:42.335
Now go unpack the skimpy amount of stuff I've gotten you so far

17:42.405 --> 17:43.968
and I'll be back in a couple of hours. Copper boom.

17:44.862 --> 17:45.764
What?

17:45.832 --> 17:47.496
It's what you said to me this morning when you were trying to speed me up.

17:47.583 --> 17:48.904
But you missed a bunch of stuff in between.

17:48.991 --> 17:50.859
I think it's catchy. Go, go, unpack.

17:51.059 --> 17:52.053
- Copper boom! 
- Copper boom!

17:58.191 --> 17:58.652
Mom!

17:59.395 --> 18:00.035
Copper boom!

18:05.145 --> 18:05.861
Hey, Luke.

18:07.787 --> 18:08.760
- Oops. 
- Shoot me.

18:08.948 --> 18:10.480
Now, or maybe later so you're surprised?

18:13.439 --> 18:16.055
Mr. Danes, a marriage contract is a contract just like any other.

18:16.230 --> 18:18.718
As the higher wage earner, Nicole wants a fair settlement.

18:18.809 --> 18:21.156
But I want nothing from her, so there's nothing to settle,

18:21.242 --> 18:23.536
- Mr... what's your name again? 
- My name is Stein.

18:23.648 --> 18:24.975
- I thought you were Stein. 
- I'm Stein as well.

18:25.093 --> 18:27.453
- Then I'm confused. 
- Mr. Danes, I'm an impatient man,

18:27.515 --> 18:29.649
I'm a busy man, I'm a sensible man, I'm a skeptical man.

18:29.736 --> 18:31.933
Oh, you're four different men, huh? Well, are they all named Stein, too?

18:32.016 --> 18:35.078
If there's one thing I've learned in this business, it's that no one wants nothing.

18:35.569 --> 18:37.494
Why won't you hire a lawyer?

18:37.602 --> 18:39.163
Why? Because lawyers waste time and money.

18:39.265 --> 18:41.353
They're needless middlemen who slither into people's lives

18:41.426 --> 18:43.340
when they're at their most vulnerable so they can clamp on

18:43.407 --> 18:46.679
and suck like leeches until everyone but them is distraught and penniless.

18:46.755 --> 18:48.134
I can see why the marriage went bad.

18:48.205 --> 18:50.447
Here's fair warning, Mr. Danes - if you don't hire a lawyer,

18:50.528 --> 18:52.372
you could wind up getting absolutely nothing.

18:52.443 --> 18:53.851
- That's what I want! 
- There he goes again.

18:53.938 --> 18:55.434
Maybe we should get Sage and Albet into this.

18:55.521 --> 18:56.592
Pettruccio, too.

18:57.738 --> 19:00.841
- They're gonna multiply like the matrix. 
- Oh, well...

19:01.164 --> 19:03.088
- Tell them, Lorelai. 
- Tell them what?

19:03.243 --> 19:05.142
- Who's this? 
- This is Lorelai.

19:05.218 --> 19:06.878
- Are you an attorney? 
- No, she's carbon-based.

19:06.948 --> 19:07.722
And what's her role?

19:07.851 --> 19:09.586
Be my character witness or something.

19:09.739 --> 19:13.011
Right, okay. Well, I can vouch for this man.

19:13.247 --> 19:18.909
I mean, I know he cared for Nicole, and apparently they both got a little rash.

19:19.109 --> 19:21.829
I mean, not in 'apply to affected area twice daily' rash,

19:21.894 --> 19:24.839
I mean rash in that they hastily entered into a union.

19:24.926 --> 19:25.587
We know all this.

19:25.678 --> 19:29.503
But if you think he married her to get something, I know that's not true.

19:29.727 --> 19:32.165
He's basically a hermit, and happy to be one.

19:32.313 --> 19:35.016
I could show you his place upstairs. I mean, you half expect Hari Krishnas

19:35.155 --> 19:37.194
to jump out of the bathroom banging tambourines.

19:37.289 --> 19:40.654
All he likes is fishing and watching baseball,

19:40.741 --> 19:43.542
and he's got a reel and he's got a TV, so he's all set.

19:43.689 --> 19:46.424
So when he says he wants nothing, I know he means it,

19:46.619 --> 19:50.352
because when I think of Luke Danes, I think nothing.

19:51.088 --> 19:53.653
Mr. Blodgett, Steins one and two, there you go.

19:53.725 --> 19:56.096
Your choice of character witness does nothing to allay our concerns.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.566
Sorry.

19:57.744 --> 20:00.658
The bottom line, time. If we do not receive a response in this matter,

20:00.756 --> 20:02.682
we're just going to have to kick this up a notch.

20:02.758 --> 20:04.525
Okay, there is something I want, but I've been holding back.

20:04.612 --> 20:06.023
- As we suspected. 
- Let's hear it.

20:06.127 --> 20:07.822
Okay, you know Nicole and I went on a cruise, right?

20:07.938 --> 20:08.974
- Oh boy. 
- Oh yeah.

20:09.081 --> 20:11.258
The first night on the boat we, uh, went to see an act

20:11.391 --> 20:14.073
that everyone was raving about. We go in, sit down, they close the door.

20:14.195 --> 20:16.437
Turned out to be a guy playing musical drinking glasses.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.987
You know, with the half-filled cups that give off different tones.

20:19.069 --> 20:22.711
He played Mozart, and I swear I could hear Mozart banging on his coffin.

20:22.885 --> 20:26.715
Out of politeness, we stayed, and there went an hour of our lives.

20:26.791 --> 20:29.704
Next night, the sign in front of the theater said the entertainment for the night

20:29.787 --> 20:31.702
was a guy singing the songs of Sinatra.

20:31.822 --> 20:35.854
We verified with the guy at the door, the songs of Frank Sinatra, right?

20:35.935 --> 20:39.376
Not Tina, not Frank Jr., not Bill Sinatra, but Ol' Blue Eyes.

20:39.442 --> 20:41.389
"Yes," he says. "It's like Frank come to life."

20:41.450 --> 20:44.215
We go in, sit down, they close the door.

20:44.302 --> 20:48.274
Then they announce that the guy singing Sinatra is sick

20:48.388 --> 20:50.605
and the glass-playing guy is filling in.

20:50.727 --> 20:52.714
Out he comes, there's goes another hour.

20:52.796 --> 20:56.308
Next night, we meet a nice couple while walking the Lido Deck.

20:56.421 --> 20:59.170
Had some nice conversation, so we have dinner with them.

20:59.236 --> 21:03.272
Everything's going great. Then they invite us to go somewhere afterwards

21:03.353 --> 21:06.841
- guess where they took us? That's right, to see the glass guy.

21:06.943 --> 21:09.765
Three nights in a row, three hours total.

21:09.851 --> 21:13.312
That's what I want - I want those three hours back.

21:13.588 --> 21:14.603
We'll have to confer on this.

21:14.791 --> 21:16.514
Maybe do a productivity study.

21:16.631 --> 21:19.354
Yeah, get Blobb, Fromm and Pinnuccio in there, too.

21:20.024 --> 21:21.904
- We'll get back to you. 
- I have no doubt.

21:23.981 --> 21:26.937
- I'm exhausted. 
- Sorry I barged in like that.

21:27.055 --> 21:28.775
Trust me, the interruption was welcome.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.775
So, did you check the clock? It's not yet four.

21:32.062 --> 21:33.373
- Rory safe and sound? 
- Safe and sound.

21:33.490 --> 21:34.308
- And the truck? 
- Well...

21:34.443 --> 21:35.903
- You wrecked it. 
- It's not wrecked.

21:36.015 --> 21:37.565
- I don't see it. 
- It's around the corner.

21:37.694 --> 21:40.070
- You wrecked it. 
- No, but I need to use it awhile longer.

21:40.146 --> 21:41.698
Because you wrecked it and it's in the shop.

21:42.128 --> 21:44.540
You really can't afford to alienate your chief character witness.

21:46.086 --> 21:47.100
- It's full of stuff. 
- I know.

21:47.242 --> 21:49.343
- Why didn't you unload it? 
- I did, this is my second load.

21:49.516 --> 21:50.806
You didn't say anything about a second load.

21:51.067 --> 21:52.787
I didn't know I had to have one 'til I realized

21:52.870 --> 21:55.098
what a piker of a mother I'd been compared to the other kids' moms.

21:55.238 --> 21:56.074
It's still running.

21:56.296 --> 21:58.993
Yeah, well, turns out that ignition key

21:59.127 --> 22:01.890
is just as misogynistic as that stick shift of yours.

22:04.263 --> 22:06.803
- You just have to jiggle it a little. 
- You didn't mention any jiggling.

22:06.883 --> 22:08.335
- It's common sense. 
- Oh, that.

22:08.824 --> 22:10.135
Wait, why is the mattress still there?

22:10.319 --> 22:12.771
Oh, that's not the mattress, that's a mattress.

22:12.910 --> 22:14.467
- What? 
- Rory has the new mattress.

22:14.604 --> 22:17.655
That's the Yale-supplied mattress that has microbes in it

22:17.713 --> 22:19.115
that date back to Henry Box Brown.

22:19.220 --> 22:20.094
What are you gonna do with it?

22:20.183 --> 22:22.377
I was thinking maybe you could store it for me.

22:22.515 --> 22:24.123
- No. 
- Come on.

22:24.549 --> 22:26.458
I can't take it back to Yale.

22:26.540 --> 22:28.250
I'm not storing your microbe mattress, forget it.

22:28.408 --> 22:30.005
Then I'm stuck here.

22:30.093 --> 22:31.204
Fine, because I need my truck back.

22:31.275 --> 22:33.650
- Fine, but that leaves you with the mattress. 
- I'm not taking the mattress.

22:33.723 --> 22:35.879
- Then let me take the truck. 
- But that means you take the mattress.

22:35.985 --> 22:37.609
- I can't take the mattress. 
- Then you can't have the truck.

22:37.768 --> 22:39.088
But that sticks you with the mattress.

22:40.136 --> 22:42.837
If you take the truck, it comes with the mattress.

22:42.918 --> 22:44.829
- I can't take the mattress. 
- Then you can't have the truck.

22:44.925 --> 22:46.271
And that sticks you with the mattress.

22:46.384 --> 22:48.689
- We've been here before. 
- I recognize that tree.

22:52.288 --> 22:53.015
Come on in.

22:55.713 --> 22:57.588
- Another suitemate has arrived. 
- Oh yeah?

22:57.772 --> 22:59.169
Yeah. She's a little weird.

22:59.379 --> 23:02.440
I've already forgotten her name. I'm a disaster with names.

23:02.555 --> 23:03.127
That's okay.

23:03.486 --> 23:06.767
It's the name of a city, like Athens or Rome or something.

23:07.279 --> 23:09.854
I'm sure things can be rearranged. I mean, why not?

23:09.977 --> 23:11.878
- It's a dorm, you're supposed to. 
- Let it go.

23:11.944 --> 23:13.209
- Paris? 
- Yeah, that's it.

23:13.516 --> 23:15.487
- How shocked are you? 
- Do you have a resuscitator?

23:15.559 --> 23:16.927
- I'm going to Yale. 
- You're going to Yale.

23:17.003 --> 23:18.703
- And we're suitemates. 
- Of all the gin joints.

23:18.779 --> 23:20.122
Give me a hug! Wait.

23:20.981 --> 23:21.647
Give me a hug!

23:22.358 --> 23:24.730
This is a massively big surprise.

23:24.864 --> 23:28.231
I was gonna call and then I thought, hey, let's wait and just be right in her face.

23:28.354 --> 23:30.419
- I can't even feel my face anymore. 
- This is a good thing.

23:30.561 --> 23:32.148
No, yes, it's definitely a good thing.

23:32.316 --> 23:35.026
It's just, again, my nose... it feels like clay.

23:35.230 --> 23:36.465
Oh, this is Terrence.

23:37.223 --> 23:37.775
Hello.

23:38.072 --> 23:39.725
It's nice to finally meet you, Rory.

23:39.987 --> 23:42.111
- Terrence is my life coach. 
- Your what?

23:42.224 --> 23:43.361
- Don't judge. 
- I'm not.

23:43.515 --> 23:46.509
Remember my nanny? I lost her over the summer.

23:46.617 --> 23:47.739
I'm sorry, what happened?

23:47.882 --> 23:49.577
She opened a pupuseria in Boise.

23:49.695 --> 23:52.684
- So she's okay? 
- Yeah, but I was pretty lost.

23:52.874 --> 23:55.894
Then my rabbi conferred with my therapist who said a hypnotist he knew

23:55.951 --> 23:58.440
thought a life coach would be right for me, and that led me to Terrence.

23:58.660 --> 24:01.333
He's here to assist me with whatever I need assistance in,

24:01.404 --> 24:04.472
from wardrobe to diet to finding me a kick-ass gynecologist.

24:04.568 --> 24:05.940
That's great, Paris, really.

24:06.043 --> 24:07.723
He's done so much for my people skills.

24:07.916 --> 24:10.210
I can cope with the little annoyances now.

24:10.353 --> 24:14.137
For instance, the old Paris would've been bothered by your penchant to hover.

24:14.296 --> 24:16.830
It would've made her wanna ring your neck until your eyeballs popped out.

24:16.995 --> 24:22.049
But now, I accept it because I can't control everything. Paris Gellar.

24:23.108 --> 24:23.927
That's Tanna.

24:24.035 --> 24:27.742
In medieval times, surnames often reflected a person's origin or occupation

24:27.839 --> 24:30.501
so they were descriptive as well as utilitarian.

24:30.916 --> 24:32.400
And what does Tanna mean?

24:33.963 --> 24:34.583
Nothing.

24:35.042 --> 24:36.113
We're gonna have some fun this year.

24:36.619 --> 24:37.152
Thank you.

24:38.888 --> 24:40.445
- How's your face? 
- Better, thanks.

24:40.650 --> 24:43.118
- Is that my room? 
- If your initials are P.G., it is.

24:44.889 --> 24:48.032
- Terrence, I got my southern exposure. 
- I'm a happy camper.

24:48.151 --> 24:51.682
So, weird, weird coincidence that we're roommates like this, huh?

24:51.765 --> 24:55.662
Not really. I told Terrence all about our history and he felt very strongly

24:55.718 --> 24:58.842
that our life journey was not complete, so my dad made a call.

25:09.705 --> 25:12.747
Luke, this was so nice of you, giving me a hand like this.

25:13.238 --> 25:14.989
It was above and beyond the call of duty.

25:15.271 --> 25:16.377
Don't start this again.

25:16.583 --> 25:18.025
- I'm not starting anything. 
- Good.

25:19.910 --> 25:22.746
- I mean, if you just had stored the mattress... 
- That's where we're not starting.

25:22.879 --> 25:24.662
What? It was your choice to come along.

25:24.805 --> 25:28.011
I wanted the safe return of my truck without the mattress guaranteed.

25:28.101 --> 25:30.905
- This was the only way. 
- You know, I miss our friendship.

25:31.005 --> 25:34.307
We used to be so close. The summers at the lake...

25:34.389 --> 25:36.216
Let's just move along here, okay?

25:36.442 --> 25:37.768
- Hi, there. 
- Hello.

25:38.429 --> 25:39.346
Is that your mattress?

25:40.052 --> 25:40.867
Well, yeah.

25:41.347 --> 25:42.965
Tag has a Yale stamp.

25:43.098 --> 25:46.134
Oh, well, when I said it was mine, it's not mine. It belongs in the dorm.

25:46.232 --> 25:48.383
We were just driving it around New Haven for awhile.

25:49.536 --> 25:51.219
- To air it out. 
- Oh, okay.

25:51.378 --> 25:53.590
- We're gonna take it right back in. 
- Great.

25:55.510 --> 25:57.649
- Thanks for jumping in. 
- You seemed to have a handle on it.

25:58.044 --> 25:59.278
- What do we do now? 
- Unload.

26:00.393 --> 26:03.578
With the mattress. What do we do with the mattress?

26:11.869 --> 26:13.655
- Saw you coming. 
- What's up?

26:13.983 --> 26:15.207
You just have to see it.

26:18.744 --> 26:19.962
- No. 
- Yes.

26:20.638 --> 26:21.160
Paris?

26:21.806 --> 26:23.338
And Terrence, her life coach.

26:23.594 --> 26:24.453
Like on Oprah?

26:24.679 --> 26:25.605
- Yes. 
- No.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.817
Yes. They're setting up her crafts' corner.

26:28.283 --> 26:29.845
- No. 
- Yes.

26:29.983 --> 26:32.221
- Lorelai! 
- Hi, Paris. It's so good to see you.

26:32.896 --> 26:33.623
Same here.

26:34.223 --> 26:36.295
- Terrence, this is Lorelai. 
- Hi, Terrence.

26:36.414 --> 26:38.216
- Nice to meet you finally. 
- Finally?

26:38.348 --> 26:40.362
You and I have a bit of a journey left to finish as well.

26:40.611 --> 26:42.916
- I'll clear my schedule. 
- I was just setting up my craft corner.

26:43.014 --> 26:46.832
Some mosaic tiles, some colored beads. Still kind of kids' stuff,

26:46.914 --> 26:50.334
but Terrence showed me how working with my hands could help with my nerves.

26:50.478 --> 26:52.885
- Oh, where are we gonna put the couch? 
- Why don't you just...

26:52.962 --> 26:54.222
- Paris... 
- Come on, Terrence.

26:54.415 --> 26:56.232
Two steps forward, three steps back.

26:56.372 --> 26:57.426
But she was baiting me.

26:57.514 --> 26:59.110
Fish can choose not to bite.

27:02.138 --> 27:03.493
We'll figure it out.

27:05.424 --> 27:07.217
- This the place? 
- This is the place.

27:07.410 --> 27:10.184
Oh, hold it a minute! You can't bring that thing in here.

27:10.334 --> 27:12.639
I'm not taking it back out. Hi, Rory.

27:12.843 --> 27:13.411
Hi, Luke.

27:13.681 --> 27:15.720
No, we're unloading bags and boxes first.

27:15.823 --> 27:18.436
Look, that Tess already had her antennae up about the mattress

27:18.541 --> 27:20.768
and she wouldn't stop watching me, so I had to do something.

27:20.871 --> 27:22.852
Wait until she's gone and then bring it back out.

27:22.944 --> 27:25.898
It's heavy. The only way I got it into the building is with help from Chip

27:26.079 --> 27:28.884
- his real name, believe it or not. Now I have to go help him

27:28.975 --> 27:30.738
unload his stuff because that was the deal.

27:30.911 --> 27:32.995
No, you don't. Blow him off.

27:33.205 --> 27:37.752
He's probably busy taping his Carmen Electra poster up on the ceiling above his bed.

27:37.992 --> 27:40.977
The mattress stays. Now if you'll excuse me, Chip is waiting.

27:41.587 --> 27:43.717
Oh no! My glue gun leaked on my macaroni!

27:44.009 --> 27:47.444
Compartmentalize... and breathe.

27:49.481 --> 27:50.803
Let's get this thing out of the hallway.

27:51.314 --> 27:54.331
I got a crisp Benjamin Franklin for anyone willing

27:54.438 --> 27:56.281
to disappear a mattress, no questions asked.

27:57.023 --> 27:57.669
Start pushing.

27:57.966 --> 27:58.550
Anyone?

28:01.005 --> 28:02.487
Two Benjamins?

28:03.572 --> 28:04.279
Hold on.

28:04.960 --> 28:07.296
Anything else you need, you'll write it down, okay?

28:07.382 --> 28:09.297
I've got more than I need. Stuff I don't need.

28:09.408 --> 28:11.489
- It's all necessary stuff. 
- The disco ball?

28:11.780 --> 28:15.849
You cannot host your much-anticipated Salute to Barry White Night without a disco ball.

28:15.953 --> 28:18.456
I forgot I was anticipating that. Where's Luke?

28:18.660 --> 28:19.619
He's already out at the truck.

28:20.612 --> 28:23.208
So, this is it.

28:23.560 --> 28:24.518
This is really it.

28:25.594 --> 28:26.474
Learn a lot of stuff.

28:26.945 --> 28:27.764
I'll try.

28:28.584 --> 28:29.654
You'll be a frequent visitor?

28:30.135 --> 28:31.599
I'll be a frequent visitor.

28:31.886 --> 28:33.437
You can use the washer and the dryer.

28:33.551 --> 28:35.368
- I don't need any inducement. 
- Good.

28:35.998 --> 28:37.514
But don't you get rid of that washer and dryer.

28:38.275 --> 28:39.125
I won't.

28:42.014 --> 28:42.664
Ciao, baby.

28:44.014 --> 28:44.651
Bye, Mom.

29:27.346 --> 29:29.794
So Chip is like, "Set your side down first" and I'm like,

29:29.835 --> 29:31.781
"My side's the side with the leg missing. It's gonna collapse.

29:31.826 --> 29:34.069
You put your side down first" and he's like, "I'm losing my grip",

29:34.181 --> 29:38.221
which was his excuse with everything we carried in - the TV, the stereo speakers.

29:38.308 --> 29:41.221
- And I was like... 
- Oh my God, will you, like, get over this?

29:42.169 --> 29:42.713
What's that?

29:43.133 --> 29:43.778
It's my pager.

29:47.096 --> 29:48.242
- Oh no. 
- What?

29:48.574 --> 29:49.261
"Come back."

29:50.465 --> 29:51.745
- What? 
- It's from Rory.

29:51.862 --> 29:54.458
It says "Come back" with about a dozen exclamation points.

29:55.748 --> 29:57.848
- Move, move. 
- What are you doing?

29:58.071 --> 29:59.644
- I gotta borrow your truck. 
- No way.

29:59.726 --> 30:01.278
- I gotta go back. 
- Then take your own car.

30:01.385 --> 30:04.048
- Remember that concept? 
- No, it'll take too long to walk back to get it.

30:04.140 --> 30:05.855
Plus, I'm out of gas. Plus, it's been making weird noises

30:05.927 --> 30:07.770
and probably can't take a long trip. Please, Luke?

30:07.867 --> 30:09.722
- I need my truck. 
- I need it more.

30:09.828 --> 30:11.037
You've had it all day.

30:11.154 --> 30:14.108
- Don't you care about Rory? 
- Of course I care about Rory.

30:17.688 --> 30:19.910
- Have it back by seven. 
- Thanks, Luke.

30:25.130 --> 30:27.466
- That's reverse. 
- I know.

30:34.084 --> 30:34.676
Rory?

30:35.342 --> 30:37.266
Oh, whoa, honey.

30:38.352 --> 30:40.462
- Look at this, look at this. 
- Look at what?

30:40.912 --> 30:43.089
Four hours at Yale and I'm already homesick.

30:43.867 --> 30:44.840
Well, that's okay.

30:45.115 --> 30:47.516
All I could think of the minute you left was "I want my mommy."

30:47.707 --> 30:49.446
I haven't thought that since I was two.

30:49.821 --> 30:51.392
- That's natural. 
- I'm eighteen.

30:51.526 --> 30:54.526
I can sign contracts, I can vote, I can fight for my country.

30:54.911 --> 30:57.337
I mean, I'm an adult. Adults don't want their mommies.

30:57.439 --> 31:00.107
Yes, they do, honey. I'm not a good example, but...

31:00.204 --> 31:02.441
Everything's so foreign. I have to share a bathroom.

31:02.575 --> 31:04.382
I've never shared a bathroom with anyone but you.

31:04.536 --> 31:07.594
So I'm gonna be running into people in the bathroom, we're gonna have to make small talk.

31:07.675 --> 31:10.864
- I don't know any bathroom small talk. 
- Gee, your hair smells terrific?

31:10.935 --> 31:13.885
You didn't socialize me properly. You made me a mama's girl.

31:14.034 --> 31:16.183
Why don't I hate you? Why don't I want to be away from you?

31:16.429 --> 31:19.713
It's going to be very hard to be Christiane Amanpour broadcasting

31:19.794 --> 31:21.662
live from a foxhole in Tehran with my mommy.

31:21.735 --> 31:23.385
I guess you're just gonna have to learn how to operate a camera

31:23.487 --> 31:25.381
- 'cause I'll need you there with me. 
- I would do that.

31:25.427 --> 31:26.711
And how did I end up at Yale?

31:27.085 --> 31:31.303
I mean, I let Grandma and Grandpa manipulate me right out of Harvard

31:31.416 --> 31:34.682
and into Yale. That's how strong-willed I am. I know nothing about Yale.

31:34.775 --> 31:36.751
Not so - you've memorized its entire history.

31:36.823 --> 31:39.885
How can you be so fine with this? You left here without a care in the world.

31:40.065 --> 31:42.270
- That's not true. 
- You couldn't wait for me to get out of the house.

31:42.388 --> 31:45.333
What were you doing when I paged you - turning my room into a sewing room?

31:45.496 --> 31:48.303
I should hate you, not miss you. Do something to make me hate you.

31:49.403 --> 31:50.151
Go Hitler!

31:51.117 --> 31:52.667
- Check this out. 
- Your student ID?

31:52.847 --> 31:55.731
I'm blinking and my head's in a funny place.

31:56.633 --> 31:58.680
- No, it's not. 
- I look like Keith Richards at Altamont.

31:59.003 --> 32:02.045
- And check out the name. 
- Ronny Gilmore. Oops.

32:02.163 --> 32:04.983
Yeah, oops. I don't even exist. And how did they get Ronny?

32:05.122 --> 32:07.718
That's not even remotely close to being short for any girl's name

32:07.856 --> 32:11.941
- in the history of the entire planet. 
- Veronica, actually... sorry.

32:12.351 --> 32:15.505
Great, now I have you apologizing to me after I made you come back all this way

32:15.634 --> 32:17.840
just 'cause I'm a big fat stinkin' mama's girl.

32:18.013 --> 32:19.381
- Mom! 
- I'm here.

32:20.236 --> 32:22.816
- But you're not supposed to be. 
- Where is it written?

32:23.073 --> 32:25.715
Well, it's not exactly written, but it's clearly implied

32:25.806 --> 32:28.316
that the parents are supposed to leave the campus at some point.

32:28.428 --> 32:31.009
Yeah, at some point. So we choose the point.

32:31.168 --> 32:33.579
- So can you stay for dinner? 
- I can stay all night.

32:33.713 --> 32:35.752
- No, you can't do that. 
- Why not?

32:35.857 --> 32:38.950
Because then I'm the pathetic person who needs her mother to stay all night

32:39.053 --> 32:40.772
and everyone here will see and know that.

32:40.901 --> 32:43.138
- Okay, so I won't spend the night. 
- No, stay the night.

32:49.758 --> 32:52.001
I've got Balinese.

32:52.773 --> 32:53.594
Where does Bali go?

32:54.038 --> 32:57.049
We're still putting everything in geographic order. East to west.

32:57.255 --> 32:59.516
- That's the system. Where is Bali? 
- Indonesia.

32:59.721 --> 33:01.569
Is Indonesia east or west of the Philippines?

33:01.760 --> 33:03.213
- East. 
- No, west.

33:03.470 --> 33:05.176
Near Singapore? We've got Singapore here somewhere.

33:05.266 --> 33:06.879
Find Sri Lanka, it's a bit over from that.

33:06.987 --> 33:09.041
- But there's no Sri Lankan food. 
- Just put it by Vietnam.

33:09.297 --> 33:11.113
Is Vietnam east or west of the Philippines?

33:11.206 --> 33:13.131
Boy, you guys really need to go to college.

33:13.325 --> 33:16.051
- We ordered too much food. 
- Hello, the point.

33:16.127 --> 33:18.712
We need a wide cross section for our local takeout test.

33:18.800 --> 33:20.745
I still smell glue from your glue gun.

33:20.816 --> 33:22.461
- You're rich, you know that? 
- What is this?

33:22.777 --> 33:26.053
You've eaten Indian food, yet I see nothing about Indian food on the chart.

33:26.162 --> 33:26.777
We'll get to it.

33:26.899 --> 33:28.574
The whole point of getting everything within delivery distance

33:28.743 --> 33:31.205
is so we can judge the quality of food, speed of service,

33:31.333 --> 33:33.494
Cuteness of delivery guys on a scale of one to ten.

33:33.735 --> 33:35.127
We cannot work from memory on this.

33:35.737 --> 33:37.528
- Where's the phone? 
- Under Mexico.

33:37.673 --> 33:38.722
I bet it's the pizza. Come help.

33:43.428 --> 33:45.792
- Hello, eight and a half. 
- I'm sorry?

33:46.120 --> 33:47.978
Nothing. We just need to sign for the credit card?

33:48.246 --> 33:48.731
Yes.

33:49.914 --> 33:51.000
Thank you.

33:51.711 --> 33:53.989
We're four people and we ordered for like four hundred.

33:54.148 --> 33:57.615
So, what you're saying is you wanna crank it up? You wanna set it off?

33:57.717 --> 33:59.677
You wanna put a match to the keg and burn this mofo down?

33:59.786 --> 34:00.969
I'm just saying it's a lot of food.

34:01.506 --> 34:03.472
- Attention, Durfee girls! 
- Mom!

34:03.758 --> 34:08.391
Food and tons of it in suite five. Bring your appetites, bring your opinions,

34:08.552 --> 34:11.228
and, someone bring some music, but if it's Evanescence,

34:11.398 --> 34:12.714
you will be severely mocked.

34:13.241 --> 34:14.665
Enter, rejoice and come in.

34:19.364 --> 34:20.610
Oh, hey, ice cream man.

34:21.721 --> 34:24.203
- Here you go. 
- Thanks. Have a nice night.

34:24.335 --> 34:26.522
You, too. do me a favor?

34:26.723 --> 34:28.243
Count to ten before you leave.

34:28.571 --> 34:29.880
- Sure. 
- Thanks.

34:32.841 --> 34:34.054
Hey, rate him, rate him!

34:37.255 --> 34:39.260
Hey, where does ice cream stand on our organizational system?

34:39.373 --> 34:41.658
Our organizational system broke down about an hour ago.

34:41.880 --> 34:44.027
- Germany fell on China. 
- Well, that's Germany for ya.

34:44.583 --> 34:48.061
Okay, we're out of Chinese completely, so we know Chinese is popular.

34:48.518 --> 34:51.309
Freddy's Happy Tokyo Takeout is a bust. That's the consensus,

34:51.411 --> 34:54.693
so let's lose the Freddy's menus, although Ang the delivery guy was a solid nine.

34:54.898 --> 34:57.621
If you're gonna go to Baja Bill's, you must get the cheese quesadilla,

34:57.714 --> 35:01.457
and ask for Stan or Tommy. If you don't get Stan or Tommy, go to Paco's Tacos.

35:01.651 --> 35:04.247
The delivery guys are butt ugly but the food is better.

35:05.435 --> 35:09.152
Look at all these girls together in one room having fun.

35:09.577 --> 35:12.105
We should dance and sing a Motown song into our hairbrushes.

35:14.662 --> 35:16.258
So, do you like your adoptive parents?

35:17.519 --> 35:19.202
I think it's good to be adopted.

35:19.693 --> 35:22.321
If you get sick of them, you just dump this set and go find the originals.

35:23.641 --> 35:25.578
- This is awesome. 
- Thanks.

35:25.700 --> 35:26.385
Who did all this?

35:26.826 --> 35:29.310
- The woman with the hairbrush. 
- You guys, come on.

35:29.432 --> 35:30.881
I know it's cheesy but just a couple bars...

35:31.637 --> 35:32.545
You Can't Hurry Love?

35:33.314 --> 35:35.740
Someone's gotta do it, it doesn't have to be on key.

35:36.882 --> 35:39.846
It's lacking in storage space, but I've accepted it.

35:40.491 --> 35:42.621
It's a bit musty, but I've accepted it.

35:43.528 --> 35:44.136
Small.

35:44.927 --> 35:46.604
Small, but I've accepted it.

35:47.496 --> 35:48.756
Hey, listen, I should be going.

35:49.549 --> 35:51.853
Jamie, Terrence is not here, he's back in his room.

35:52.692 --> 35:55.401
Oh, right, me and Terrence, that's a possibility.

35:56.891 --> 35:59.508
I really gotta go, okay? I will. Good night.

36:00.434 --> 36:01.357
Has he met Terrence?

36:01.976 --> 36:04.270
Nope, and he's not going to for as long as I can help it.

36:04.474 --> 36:07.356
- I fixed your shower head. 
- Really? But it was barely dribbling out.

36:07.474 --> 36:09.661
It just needed a twist. You've got a waterfall now.

36:09.814 --> 36:11.540
- You're so handy. 
- And my rates are reasonable.

36:11.775 --> 36:12.780
- My turn? 
- It's all yours.

36:14.356 --> 36:15.774
No, Mom, you sleep on the new mattress.

36:16.121 --> 36:18.600
- But it's yours. 
- They're both mine, so I get to choose.

36:18.754 --> 36:21.390
- I'll sleep on the Yale mattress. 
- But you have to break in your new mattress.

36:21.686 --> 36:26.014
If it molds to my body, your shorter body will be wallowing in the hollowness of my body.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.058
In one night?

36:27.477 --> 36:28.902
It's the crucial night, that first night.

36:29.195 --> 36:31.262
Okay, but my offer still stands,

36:31.421 --> 36:34.600
so if you get the heebie-jeebies in the middle of the night over there, come join me.

36:35.419 --> 36:41.102
That'll get the girls talking. We'll be those dirty, filthy, almost-French Stars Hollow girls.

36:41.498 --> 36:46.669
Oh, we spit on you, you repressed puritanical ninnies.

36:46.759 --> 36:48.676
We smirk in your general direction.

36:48.761 --> 36:53.243
We cast sidelong glances that are vague but slightly threatening.

36:53.330 --> 36:55.869
We eschew your quaint double entendre

36:55.962 --> 36:59.464
for the appealing lasciviousness of the entendre singular.

36:59.529 --> 37:01.901
We... I'm out.

37:02.049 --> 37:02.934
Me, too. Get the light.

37:09.811 --> 37:11.894
- Did I tell you I found good coffee? 
- No, where?

37:12.003 --> 37:15.321
The little kiosk by the library. I found it on the way to that parents thing.

37:15.412 --> 37:15.949
Cool.

37:16.084 --> 37:17.568
- I'll circle it on the map for you. 
- Good.

37:22.443 --> 37:23.830
Is that some guy howling?

37:24.257 --> 37:26.027
I don't know, sounded like it.

37:26.477 --> 37:29.657
- Sounds like the guys' floor had some fun tonight, too. 
- I'd say so.

37:34.635 --> 37:38.063
- Mom! 
- Well, if no one answers him, he may never stop.

37:40.029 --> 37:42.543
Or it'll get a bunch of other guys howling, one or the other.

37:45.571 --> 37:47.500
- Oh, boy. 
- It's fun.

37:54.898 --> 37:55.599
It is fun.

38:01.508 --> 38:02.655
- What? 
- I don't know.

38:05.599 --> 38:07.452
So, what's first on the agenda today?

38:07.790 --> 38:10.653
I have a little time, so I thought I might walk around

38:10.718 --> 38:13.227
and get the lay of the land a little bit, and then I have my big freshman assembly.

38:13.355 --> 38:15.311
Where they teach you the secret Yale handshake?

38:15.414 --> 38:16.642
Amongst other things.

38:16.842 --> 38:19.418
Oh my God, check out Paris' craft corner.

38:19.547 --> 38:22.050
She gets more done before nine than other people do all day.

38:22.203 --> 38:25.327
She's a craft person now, so it's not safe to leave anything around her anymore.

38:25.428 --> 38:27.748
- Maybe that's where crafty comes from. 
- Good point.

38:28.240 --> 38:30.527
All right, I should go. I called Luke last night

38:30.622 --> 38:33.892
and he made me promise to get the truck back by two hours ago,

38:33.990 --> 38:35.865
so if I leave now it's sooner than I planned.

38:36.119 --> 38:37.496
Thank Luke a lot for me, okay?

38:39.309 --> 38:41.501
Okay, say goodbye to Paris and Tanna.

38:41.701 --> 38:42.344
Will do.

38:44.040 --> 38:46.581
- So, this is really it. 
- Yup.

38:47.379 --> 38:48.700
- You good? 
- I'm good.

38:48.864 --> 38:51.224
- Just keep your pager with you. 
- Always.

39:02.693 --> 39:03.917
- You're late. 
- I'm sorry.

39:03.993 --> 39:05.866
It's okay. I told you to get it back three hours

39:05.949 --> 39:08.407
before I actually needed it back and it worked out perfectly.

39:08.535 --> 39:09.988
- You rat. 
- So it's in park?

39:10.137 --> 39:11.852
- It's in park. 
- Engine's off?

39:12.558 --> 39:14.545
Yes. Here are your keys.

39:14.806 --> 39:18.034
And thank you, Luke. I've been a huge burden on you the past couple days.

39:18.313 --> 39:18.883
It's okay.

39:20.465 --> 39:21.284
I don't believe it.

39:24.709 --> 39:26.398
- It's like a horror movie. 
- Oh, Luke.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.200
The mattress that would not leave my truck.

39:28.374 --> 39:29.793
- I had no choice. 
- I may cry.

39:29.906 --> 39:31.606
- Don't do that. 
- I don't want this mattress.

39:31.846 --> 39:33.156
- Help me take it somewhere. 
- Where?

39:33.316 --> 39:36.807
To the conveniently located old mattress drop-off station right around the corner?

39:36.941 --> 39:39.885
- Or if you could store it for awhile... 
- I wasn't kidding about the crying.

39:39.986 --> 39:42.956
I'll call a charity and have them come pick it up. I promise, and this time I mean it.

39:43.094 --> 39:44.057
And where's my spare tire?

39:44.391 --> 39:46.412
- There was a spare tire? 
- I had my spare tire back here.

39:46.649 --> 39:49.474
Oh, we must've accidentally unloaded it on one of our trips.

39:49.766 --> 39:50.816
Could you try to get it back?

39:50.996 --> 39:54.220
Yes, as long as Paris hasn't made it into a planter yet.

39:54.442 --> 39:56.960
- Or I'll buy you a new one, I promise. 
- Okay, I'll see you later.

39:57.113 --> 40:00.898
Okay, bye. Oh, and Rory says thanks for everything, too.

40:01.062 --> 40:04.148
- She said specifically to tell you. 
- Okay, good. So she's okay?

40:04.429 --> 40:06.826
- She's fantastic. 
- Good.

40:14.439 --> 40:16.365
- You're up? 
- I was up. Come on in.

40:16.902 --> 40:19.257
We Lorelai'd a few places and found the good coffee.

40:19.714 --> 40:21.341
- Lorelai'd? 
- Checked places out.

40:21.450 --> 40:24.157
Seems like the appropriate word. We found decent muffins, too,

40:24.224 --> 40:26.421
- but I bet there's better out there. 
- You'll Lorelai 'em another time.

40:26.574 --> 40:29.979
So this is thanks for last night. It was a perfect first night at Yale.

40:30.103 --> 40:30.833
I thought so.

40:30.998 --> 40:32.287
We're gonna go to freshman assembly together.

40:32.370 --> 40:33.210
- Do you wanna come? 
- Sure.

40:33.338 --> 40:37.135
Then we're all going to conveniently lose our student ID's and go take new pictures.

40:37.244 --> 40:39.277
- Oh my God, I'm so with you on that one. 
- Cool.

40:40.711 --> 40:43.593
Whoa, this is really good. Kiosk by the library?

40:43.726 --> 40:46.696
- Oh, you found it first. 
- Kind of.
