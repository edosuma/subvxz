This is it: the future home
of Channel 6 News.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.569
Well, what do you
think of it?

01:10.571 --> 01:14.172
Totally awesome.

01:14.174 --> 01:16.007
The newsroom
will be over here,

01:16.009 --> 01:18.409
and the broadcasting area
will be over there.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.344
Oh, and the penthouse
floor will be

01:20.346 --> 01:22.380
one big revolving restaurant!

01:22.382 --> 01:23.314
Radical.

01:23.316 --> 01:25.082
You could set it
at super-spin

01:25.084 --> 01:26.217
and make pizzas.

01:26.219 --> 01:28.886
And finally, my office.

01:28.888 --> 01:31.256
And this time,
it's a corner office.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.390
Terrific.

01:32.392 --> 01:34.593
But, uh, hanging pictures
could be a problem.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.529
I'd like to think of it
as Burne's birthday
present to me.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.397
And it's all
going to be mine!

01:39.399 --> 01:40.899
It's her birthday?

01:40.901 --> 01:42.734
Uh-oh. We forgot.

01:42.736 --> 01:45.737
Aah!

01:45.739 --> 01:47.838
Oh, no! She's headed
for the edge!

01:47.840 --> 01:49.574
Chill, dudette!
I gotcha!

01:51.711 --> 01:53.444
Help!

01:53.446 --> 01:56.247
Oh, whew!

01:56.249 --> 01:58.583
Oh, brother.
What luck.

01:58.585 --> 01:59.651
Boy, I'll say.

01:59.653 --> 02:00.985
It's hard to find
a combination

02:00.987 --> 02:03.688
"Happy Birthday"
and "Get Well Soon" card.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.924
[Krang]
Shredder, I can't believe

02:05.926 --> 02:08.460
you're actually
suggesting that.

02:08.461 --> 02:13.164
Planning to invade the city
with armor-plated bulldozers?

02:13.166 --> 02:17.235
I've never heard
of a more idiotic idea!

02:17.237 --> 02:19.070
Well, it beats
your stupid idea

02:19.072 --> 02:21.306
of bungee jumping
foot soldiers.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.174
I don't have
to take this abuse

02:23.176 --> 02:24.776
from the likes of you!

02:24.778 --> 02:28.647
And I don't have to be insulted
by an octopus like you!

02:28.649 --> 02:29.748
Oh, yeah?

02:29.750 --> 02:30.782
Oh, yeah.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.617
[explosion]
What was that?

02:32.619 --> 02:33.918
Don't ask me.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.820
You're the one
with the big brain.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.321
[rumbling]

02:37.323 --> 02:38.890
We're being bombarded

02:38.892 --> 02:42.393
by intense firepower
from the surface.

02:42.395 --> 02:43.594
Bebop, Rocksteady,

02:43.596 --> 02:45.964
go topside and find out
what's happening.

02:45.966 --> 02:49.434
[Bebop]
But-- But I don't want to go!

02:49.436 --> 02:51.336
M-Me, neither!

02:51.338 --> 02:53.170
It's wet out there.

02:53.172 --> 02:56.574
Get going,
you chicken-livered
blister brains.

02:56.576 --> 02:58.609
And I want
a full damage report.

02:58.611 --> 03:01.179
Here, let me give you a hand.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.882
Or better yet, a finger.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.385
Yow!

03:07.387 --> 03:09.820
[Bebop]
Huh?

03:09.822 --> 03:10.655
Hey!

03:10.657 --> 03:12.390
What's going on?

03:12.392 --> 03:14.258
Whoa!

03:16.862 --> 03:19.097
Whoa!

03:20.565 --> 03:22.267
[Leonardo]
Fellas, we gotta decide

03:22.269 --> 03:24.002
on a present
for April's birthday.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.337
And this program
may be just the answer.

03:26.339 --> 03:28.106
<i>The Shop</i>
<i>Till You Drop Channel</i>

03:28.108 --> 03:30.175
<i>is offering this</i>
<i>one-time-only special:</i>

03:30.177 --> 03:32.811
<i>a complete set</i>
<i>of ninja kitchen knives.</i>

03:32.813 --> 03:34.145
All right!

03:34.147 --> 03:37.015
Now, that's something
every homemaker could use.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.216
Forget it, dude.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.118
What she needs
is this purse-sized

03:40.120 --> 03:41.586
portable pizza-maker.

03:41.588 --> 03:43.654
When choosing a gift
for someone,

03:43.656 --> 03:47.391
it is wise to consider
their taste, not your own.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.393
You know,
Master Splinter's right.

03:49.395 --> 03:52.163
That's why we should get her
this home science kit,

03:52.165 --> 03:54.665
complete with test tubes
and Bunsen burner.

03:54.667 --> 03:56.801
Right. Be the first
on your block

03:56.803 --> 03:58.636
to blow up
your own building.

03:58.638 --> 04:00.004
[Leonardo]
Okay, Raphael.

04:00.006 --> 04:02.140
If you're so smart,
what should be buy her?

04:02.142 --> 04:03.708
Simple, Leonardo.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.744
This comedy fitness
video I rented.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.578
<i>Chuckle Away</i>
<i>Your Chubbiness.</i>

04:07.580 --> 04:10.148
[Other turtles]
<i>Chuckle Away</i>
<i>Your Chubbiness?</i>

04:10.150 --> 04:12.851
Hey, I don't write 'em.
I just rent 'em.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.253
[Vernon]
I can't believe it!

04:15.255 --> 04:17.021
This is outrageous!

04:17.023 --> 04:18.890
[Irma]
Now, calm down, Vernon.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.423
It can't be that bad.

04:20.426 --> 04:21.459
Oh, no?

04:21.461 --> 04:24.062
April's new office
is bigger than mine.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.064
It's right here
in blue and white.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.866
Well, what are you
griping about?

04:27.868 --> 04:30.568
My office is smaller
than the broom closet.

04:30.570 --> 04:32.036
Oh, it's just not fair.

04:32.038 --> 04:34.305
It-- It's just not fair.
Mm.

04:34.307 --> 04:36.307
Speaking of April,
don't forget

04:36.309 --> 04:37.509
the surprise birthday party

04:37.511 --> 04:38.776
we're throwing her
this afternoon.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.945
I'm on my way to pick up
the cake now.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.580
You'll be there,
won't you, Vernon?

04:42.582 --> 04:45.083
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.851
[door closes]
[chuckling]

04:46.853 --> 04:50.488
And have I got
a surprise for her.

04:57.596 --> 05:00.098
What is this place?

05:00.100 --> 05:03.167
Well, it looks like
some kind of spaceship.

05:03.169 --> 05:05.436
I wonder
who it belongs to.

05:05.438 --> 05:06.637
It's mine...

05:06.639 --> 05:10.007
disgustingly
unkempt creature.

05:10.009 --> 05:13.311
You may call me Shreeka.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.712
[giggles]
Did you hear that?

05:14.714 --> 05:16.080
Shreeka.

05:16.082 --> 05:17.081
[both laugh]

05:17.083 --> 05:18.482
What a scream.

05:18.484 --> 05:21.452
I'll teach you to be
insolent with me.

05:22.588 --> 05:23.988
Whoa!

05:25.457 --> 05:27.057
And that's just a sample

05:27.059 --> 05:29.727
of what I have
in store for Krang.

05:29.729 --> 05:32.463
Uh, you know Krang?

05:32.465 --> 05:33.965
Only too well.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.967
For eons I've scoured
the universe

05:35.969 --> 05:38.102
in search of that
two-faced double-crosser,

05:38.104 --> 05:40.371
and at last
I found him.

05:40.373 --> 05:43.240
We have an ancient
score to settle.

05:43.242 --> 05:46.911
Now give me Krang's
videocom access code.

05:46.913 --> 05:49.313
Uh-uh.
No can do, lady.

05:49.315 --> 05:51.415
He's got an unlisted number.

05:51.417 --> 05:55.352
Perhaps you gentlemen
didn't understand me!

05:57.723 --> 05:59.757
[both grunting]

06:02.795 --> 06:04.762
Uh, well, in this case,

06:04.764 --> 06:07.131
I guess we can
make an exception.

06:07.133 --> 06:10.001
<i>Well, Krang,</i>

06:10.003 --> 06:11.970
<i>so we finally meet again.</i>

06:11.972 --> 06:14.271
Galloping galaxies!

06:14.273 --> 06:16.207
It can't be.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.474
That's right.

06:17.476 --> 06:21.546
It's Shreeka, your former
partner in crime.

06:21.548 --> 06:25.482
Why, my dear,
you look wonderful.

06:25.484 --> 06:28.786
I haven't seen you
in light years.

06:28.788 --> 06:32.557
That's because you abandoned me
in the Andromeda Galaxy

06:32.559 --> 06:35.593
and made off with
my most potent weapon,

06:35.595 --> 06:38.128
my Power Pack Energy Ring.

06:38.130 --> 06:40.497
And I have come
to reclaim it.

06:40.499 --> 06:42.499
Your energy ring?

06:42.501 --> 06:44.635
Well, now, uh,
let me think.

06:44.637 --> 06:46.871
What did I do with it?

06:46.873 --> 06:50.508
<i>Think fast,</i>
<i>you ganglion gangster!</i>

06:50.510 --> 06:52.843
<i>My finger's getting itchy.</i>

06:52.845 --> 06:53.912
Think fast, think fast.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.846
I-I just remembered!

06:55.848 --> 06:58.649
I gave the ring to,
uh, Miss April O'Neil.

06:58.651 --> 07:01.518
She's a television reporter
for Channel 6

07:01.520 --> 07:03.421
in the city above us.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.422
<i>A reporter, you say?</i>

07:05.424 --> 07:09.093
<i>Well, she may be the subject</i>
<i>of tonight's headline story.</i>

07:09.095 --> 07:10.228
Excuse me.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.696
About the mutants--

07:11.698 --> 07:13.898
You mean these
vulgar specimens?

07:13.900 --> 07:15.967
I intend keeping them
as hostages

07:15.969 --> 07:18.202
until that ring
is back on my finger.

07:18.204 --> 07:21.705
<i>Until then, Krang.</i>

07:21.707 --> 07:25.342
How dare that woman
accuse me,

07:25.344 --> 07:28.512
the mighty Krang,
ruler of Dimension X,

07:28.514 --> 07:31.415
of stealing her dopey ring!

07:31.417 --> 07:32.516
So you didn't do it?

07:32.518 --> 07:33.717
Of course I did.

07:33.719 --> 07:36.954
I just don't like her
accusing me of it.

07:38.457 --> 07:40.324
It's a beauty, isn't it?

07:40.326 --> 07:42.392
Here, try it on for size.

07:46.365 --> 07:49.700
Now aim it and watch
what happens.

07:52.538 --> 07:55.572
A weapon that also makes
a fashion statement.

07:55.574 --> 07:56.573
I like it.

07:56.575 --> 07:58.575
I'm glad you approve.

07:58.577 --> 08:03.180
Now see that it's delivered
to April O'Neil ASAP.

08:03.182 --> 08:06.484
Krang, this is much
too valuable to give away.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.586
Not anymore.

08:08.588 --> 08:11.389
Time has drained it
of most of its powers.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.491
It's running on fumes.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.995
Best of all, when Shreeka
tracks down April,

08:16.997 --> 08:19.797
the Turtles
will rush to her rescue.

08:19.799 --> 08:22.266
Then Shreeka
and those shellbacks

08:22.268 --> 08:24.568
will destroy one another!

08:24.570 --> 08:26.937
Not to mention
Rocksteady and Bebop.

08:26.939 --> 08:28.839
We'll be rid
of them, too!

08:28.841 --> 08:31.843
Oh, Krang,
you really are brilliant.

08:31.845 --> 08:35.813
[Krang]
As if there were
ever any doubt.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:44.790 --> 08:46.724
Keep your distance, you two.

08:46.726 --> 08:49.860
I wouldn't want people
to think we're together.

08:51.997 --> 08:54.365
Uh, what's that thing?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.633
It's a Dimension X
fax tracker.

08:56.635 --> 08:58.436
[beeping]
Uh-huh.

08:58.438 --> 09:01.973
It's already located
Miss April O'Neil.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.841
Come with me.

09:09.414 --> 09:11.148
What a fetching ring.

09:11.150 --> 09:14.518
April O'Neil will
just die to have it.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.720
And now to write
a touching note

09:16.722 --> 09:18.822
from her slimy
green friends.

09:18.824 --> 09:20.224
[chuckling]

09:20.226 --> 09:23.294
I can hardly wait
for the final confrontation

09:23.296 --> 09:25.563
between those Turtles
and Shreeka.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.231
Once they exterminate
each other,

09:27.233 --> 09:29.067
I'll take back the ring!

09:29.069 --> 09:31.001
Krang may be willing
to part with it,

09:31.003 --> 09:32.136
but I'm not.

09:32.138 --> 09:34.539
With this ring's
destructive power,

09:34.541 --> 09:36.507
I can carry out my own plan

09:36.509 --> 09:38.842
of world conquest!

09:38.844 --> 09:41.712
[Michelangelo]
Whoa, scope out
those sparklers.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.647
Sure wish I had
worn my shades.

09:43.649 --> 09:44.915
Maybe we'll get an idea

09:44.917 --> 09:46.650
for April's birthday
present in here.

09:46.652 --> 09:48.819
In Spiffany's?
Come on!

09:48.821 --> 09:50.988
This place
is way too rich
for our blood.

09:50.990 --> 09:53.624
Hey, it doesn't cost
anything to look.

09:53.626 --> 09:54.658
Come on.

09:55.727 --> 09:56.894
[bells tinkling]

09:56.896 --> 10:00.831
Wow, the turtles
are shopping at Spiffany's?

10:00.833 --> 10:04.001
Could they actually be buying
April's birthday gift

10:04.003 --> 10:05.970
in a snazzy place like that?

10:05.972 --> 10:08.172
Nah.

10:08.174 --> 10:09.440
[beeping]

10:09.442 --> 10:11.775
We're getting closer
to this April person.

Don't dawdle.
Try to keep up.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.112

10:15.114 --> 10:16.447
Stop.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.448
Uh!

10:17.450 --> 10:19.783
What manner
of place is this?

10:19.785 --> 10:22.753
Oh, oh, oh!
It's a jewelry store.

10:22.755 --> 10:25.089
They sell lots
of sparkly things.

10:25.091 --> 10:27.158
I like jewelry.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.327
It sets off my eyes.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.928
You two wait out here.

10:30.930 --> 10:33.998
But what about finding
the O'Neil dame?

10:34.000 --> 10:35.065
Vengeance can wait.

10:35.067 --> 10:36.734
A girl has to look
her best

of destruction.

10:42.241 --> 10:43.707

10:44.909 --> 10:47.011
Here, make yourselves useful.

10:47.013 --> 10:49.146
I'm bored with shopping.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.782
Now, let's find
this April O'Neil.

10:51.784 --> 10:54.185
Uh-oh, it's the turtles.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.287
Turtles?
What turtles?

10:56.289 --> 10:58.522
The Teenage...
Mutant...

10:58.524 --> 11:01.058
Ninja...
Turtles, dudette!

11:05.363 --> 11:07.965
Now hand over
those stolen jewels!

11:07.967 --> 11:10.435
Who are these
annoying creatures?

11:10.437 --> 11:12.470
They're
April O'Neil's
buddies.

11:12.472 --> 11:15.139
I've always said
the only good reptile

11:15.141 --> 11:18.009
is a shoulder bag
with matching pumps.

11:19.811 --> 11:21.712
[yelling]

11:23.982 --> 11:25.783
How annoying.

11:25.785 --> 11:28.018
I chipped a fingernail.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.555
[humming]

11:30.557 --> 11:32.523
Now, let's see.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.859
Where can I hide
this birthday cake?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.827
The closet! Perfect!

11:36.829 --> 11:39.696
April will never find it here
in Mr. Thompson's office!

11:43.168 --> 11:44.101

11:44.103 --> 11:45.636
Irma!
Vernon!

11:45.638 --> 11:47.838
Irma, what are you
doing here?

11:47.840 --> 11:49.773
I was hiding April's
birthday cake.

11:49.775 --> 11:51.042
What about you?

11:51.044 --> 11:52.643
Uh, who, me?

11:52.645 --> 11:54.345
Oh...
[laughs]

11:54.347 --> 11:56.013
I-- I was also
hiding something.

11:56.015 --> 11:58.315
Oh, I get it.

11:58.317 --> 12:00.418
It's a present for April.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.720
[giggles]
I sure hope she likes it.

12:04.256 --> 12:06.657
Actually,
it's a present for me,

12:06.659 --> 12:09.760
and I know
I'll just love it.

12:16.167 --> 12:18.668
Whew, Leo-nar-do!

12:18.670 --> 12:20.271
Would you mind standing
somewhere else?

12:20.273 --> 12:21.505
Like, uh, Utah?

12:21.507 --> 12:23.840
Guys, this is serious.

12:23.842 --> 12:26.244
I did an intergalactic
scan search

12:26.246 --> 12:28.946
identifying that woman
we had the run-in with.

12:28.948 --> 12:30.548
Her name is Shreeka.

12:30.550 --> 12:35.118
She's an interplanetary outlaw
wanted in 13 different galaxies

12:35.120 --> 12:38.389
for crimes too unspeakable
to speak about.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.357
And she's also
a pretty nifty dresser.

12:40.359 --> 12:42.526
And she's after April!

12:43.594 --> 12:44.861
[Burne]
April O'Neil!

12:44.863 --> 12:47.932
This is Burne Thompson
calling April O'Neil!

12:47.934 --> 12:49.400
<i>Get in here</i>
<i>on the double!</i>

12:49.402 --> 12:50.501
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

12:50.503 --> 12:52.002
Yes, Mr. Thompson!

12:52.004 --> 12:53.904
R-Right away!

12:53.906 --> 12:55.605
[panting]

12:55.607 --> 12:57.174
Is there something
wrong, Chief?

12:57.176 --> 12:59.209
You bet there's
something wrong!

12:59.211 --> 13:01.879
How can we throw you
a birthday party

13:01.881 --> 13:03.647
when you're not here?

13:03.649 --> 13:05.782
Surprise!
Surprise!

13:05.784 --> 13:07.451
Happy Birthday,
April!

13:07.453 --> 13:08.886
Gee, thanks, gang.

13:08.888 --> 13:10.654
I'm really touched.

13:10.656 --> 13:13.390
And now
for the final surprise.

13:13.392 --> 13:15.826
Ta...da.

13:18.297 --> 13:22.133
Well, Vernon, what have you
got to say for yourself?

13:22.135 --> 13:24.969
[awkward laugh]
Happy Birthday?

13:24.971 --> 13:27.571
April, here's a little
gift for you.

13:27.573 --> 13:30.240
Oh, really, Irma,
you shouldn't have.

13:30.242 --> 13:31.409
I didn't.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.143
Someone just delivered it
to the station.

13:33.145 --> 13:36.514
"To April,
from Leonardo, Raphael,

13:36.516 --> 13:38.416
Donatello,
and Michelangelo."

13:38.418 --> 13:40.250
[all gasping]

13:40.252 --> 13:43.421
They really were
shopping in Spiffany's.

13:43.423 --> 13:46.056
I can't believe it.

13:46.058 --> 13:47.325
[TurtleCom beeping]
It's the Turtles.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.660
They're probably dying to hear
how I like their present.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.696
Um, excuse me
for a moment.

13:57.202 --> 13:58.335
Hi, Leonardo.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.770
<i>April, are you all right?</i>

13:59.772 --> 14:02.172
All right?
I'm walking on air!

14:02.174 --> 14:05.176
The present you sent
is absolutely gorgeous!

14:05.178 --> 14:07.478
<i>Present? But we never</i>
<i>got you anything.</i>

14:07.480 --> 14:09.646
Oh, now, there's
no need to be coy.

14:09.648 --> 14:11.548
I simply love the ring.

14:11.550 --> 14:12.949
<i>Ring? What ring?</i>

14:12.951 --> 14:14.619
<i>We're calling</i>
<i>to warn you about--</i>

14:14.621 --> 14:16.920
Okay, everyone.
Party time is over.

14:16.922 --> 14:18.322
Everyone back to work!

14:18.324 --> 14:21.759
As for you, birthday girl,
here's my gift.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.260
Get down to Pier 86

14:23.262 --> 14:25.162
and cover that big
tug boat fire.

14:25.164 --> 14:27.531
Right, Chief.
I'm on my way!

14:29.167 --> 14:30.400
Oh, no!

14:30.402 --> 14:33.170
April is in the worst
trouble of her entire life,

14:33.172 --> 14:35.138
and she doesn't even know it!

14:36.441 --> 14:39.043
[beeping]

14:39.045 --> 14:41.678
April O'Neil is
somewhere in this area.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.580
The signal
is getting stronger.

14:43.582 --> 14:44.849
[panting]

14:44.851 --> 14:47.317
And I'm getting weaker.

14:47.319 --> 14:49.487
Aha. Channel 6.

14:49.489 --> 14:52.056
I have April O'Neil
at last.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.325
That ring
will be mine once more,

14:54.327 --> 14:57.094
along with my full
destructive powers!

14:57.096 --> 14:59.730
Now to reclaim it.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.133
That foolish female.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.701
Little does she realize

15:03.703 --> 15:06.804
that what's hers
will soon be mine.

15:06.806 --> 15:10.675
Hurry! My ring
is finally at hand!

15:10.677 --> 15:12.543
Hey, look!

15:12.545 --> 15:13.744
It's April O'Neil.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.780
And she's leaving
the building.

15:15.782 --> 15:18.315
Hurry, you fools!
After her!

15:19.618 --> 15:22.986
Whoaaa!

15:22.988 --> 15:24.020
Ooh!

15:25.724 --> 15:27.091
She's gone!

15:27.093 --> 15:29.527
Thanks to you imbeciles,
we've lost her.

15:29.529 --> 15:33.364
Uh, looks like you also
lost your tracker gadget.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.299
That does it!

15:35.301 --> 15:38.468
I'll pay him back
for trifling with me this way!

15:38.470 --> 15:39.937
Krang!

15:39.939 --> 15:42.806
I've had it with these
incompetent mutants.

15:42.808 --> 15:44.407
I'm sending them back!

15:44.409 --> 15:46.810
<i>Forget it, Shreeka, my dear.</i>

15:46.812 --> 15:48.178
<i>A deal is a deal.</i>

15:48.180 --> 15:49.446
<i>You're stuck with them.</i>

15:49.448 --> 15:51.649
<i>Hah ha ha-ha-ha.</i>

15:51.651 --> 15:53.583
Oh, that Krang.

15:53.585 --> 15:57.888
Yo, Shreeka, I found
April O'Neil for you.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.056
You did? Where is she?

16:00.058 --> 16:01.992
Right up there.

16:05.363 --> 16:08.599
Don't just stand there!
Follow her!

16:08.601 --> 16:09.633
[Leonardo]
We have to warn April

16:09.635 --> 16:11.902
that this Shreeka person
is on her trail.

16:11.904 --> 16:13.537
We gotta find her first.

16:13.539 --> 16:14.839
Any sign of her yet,
Donatello?

16:14.841 --> 16:16.006
Negative.

16:16.008 --> 16:18.242
Try her TurtleCom again, guys.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.077
I'll do the honors.
Irma?

16:20.079 --> 16:21.478
<i>Hi, guys.</i>

16:21.480 --> 16:23.914
<i>What's new in the exciting</i>
<i>world of sewers?</i>

16:23.916 --> 16:25.916
Irma, this is most important.

16:25.918 --> 16:27.351
Where's April?

16:27.353 --> 16:29.319
<i>Mm, she's off covering</i>
<i>some tug boat fire</i>

16:29.321 --> 16:30.487
<i>at Pier 86.</i>

16:30.489 --> 16:31.922
<i>She left in such a hurry,</i>

16:31.924 --> 16:33.257
<i>she forgot her TurtleCom.</i>

16:33.259 --> 16:35.593
Oh, my gosh,
this is terrible.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.294
<i>Would you care</i>
<i>to leave her a message?</i>

16:37.296 --> 16:40.397
Yes, the message is
watch out!

16:40.399 --> 16:42.132
[April]
Whoa, what great footage!

16:42.134 --> 16:44.367
I'm glad the tug boat crew
has been rescued.

16:44.369 --> 16:45.970
Aha!

16:45.972 --> 16:47.905
There she is.

16:47.907 --> 16:50.574
Now to take careful aim.

16:50.576 --> 16:52.075
This is too much.

16:52.077 --> 16:54.277
I gotta sit down.

16:58.349 --> 17:00.985
Uh! My finger!

17:00.987 --> 17:03.153
It won't work when it's wet.

17:03.155 --> 17:06.557
Yeah. I got the same
problem with my hands.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.492
That's why I never
wash them.

17:08.493 --> 17:10.193
She's getting away!

17:10.194 --> 17:12.095
After her!

17:12.097 --> 17:14.765
Oh, man!
More running?

17:14.767 --> 17:16.467
If I knew this
was going to happen,

17:16.469 --> 17:18.669
I would've brought
my sneakers.

17:22.740 --> 17:24.809
Here we are, Pier 86.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.242
Looks
like we're too late.

17:26.244 --> 17:27.645
The fire's already out.

17:27.646 --> 17:30.413
And worst of all,
April's gone.

Hurry, you simpletons!

19:14.220 --> 19:16.353
[gasps]
Shredder!

19:16.355 --> 19:18.722
You actually risked
your life to save me?

19:18.724 --> 19:20.023
Not you.

19:20.025 --> 19:21.859
It's this ring I'm after.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.961
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

19:23.963 --> 19:26.730
At last,
the city will be mine!

19:26.732 --> 19:30.901
As for you, Ms. O'Neil,
have a pleasant flight.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.270
I'll take over
from here, Shred-man.

19:35.840 --> 19:38.242
Dah! What in blazes--

19:38.244 --> 19:41.311
Maybe this will help
to cement our relationship!

19:41.313 --> 19:43.814
Don't you just hate
those cornball lines?

19:43.816 --> 19:45.515
You're too late, shellbacks.

19:45.517 --> 19:47.417
I have the energy ring.

19:47.419 --> 19:49.853
You mean you had the ring.

19:52.624 --> 19:56.059
Uh, this might be
a good moment to leave.

19:56.061 --> 19:57.894
Shred-head
is getting away.

19:57.896 --> 19:59.129
Forget him.

19:59.131 --> 20:01.465
We've got a bigger problem
on our hands.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.566
[Donatello]
Don't you mean
on Shreeka's hand?

20:03.568 --> 20:07.805
Mine at last,
after all these eons.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.807
[thunder crashing]

20:09.809 --> 20:14.711
Now to demonstrate its powers
on your ridiculous reptiles!

20:14.713 --> 20:16.647
[laughing]

20:16.649 --> 20:18.682
Take cover!

20:21.086 --> 20:23.320
Two can play at that game.

20:25.923 --> 20:28.325
Whoa! Uh!

20:28.327 --> 20:30.460
Great balls of fire!

20:32.831 --> 20:35.632
Didn't I see this once in a--
whoa-- shooting gallery?

20:35.634 --> 20:39.169
Enough toying with these
measly earthlings!

20:39.171 --> 20:43.774
Now suffer the full
wrath of Shreeka!

20:43.776 --> 20:45.743
[laughs]

20:45.745 --> 20:47.877
Those things
are blasting holes

20:47.879 --> 20:49.179
right through
the steel girders.

20:51.616 --> 20:53.450
We've gotta get the ring
away from Shreeka

20:53.452 --> 20:55.619
before this entire
structure collapses.

20:57.989 --> 21:00.224
You're pretty good
at pitching, Shreeka.

21:00.226 --> 21:02.492
How are you at catching?

21:04.028 --> 21:05.595
Haven't you noticed?

21:05.597 --> 21:08.598
I'm magnificent in everything.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.667
I don't think
you should've done that.

21:10.669 --> 21:13.236
Why not,
you overgrown oaf?

21:13.238 --> 21:15.505
My hands are impervious
to heat.

21:15.507 --> 21:17.674
But your ring ain't.

21:17.676 --> 21:19.776
Oh, no!

21:19.778 --> 21:22.679
It's melting!

21:22.681 --> 21:28.284
My precious power ring,
gone forever!

21:28.286 --> 21:32.056
Aah!

21:32.058 --> 21:33.390
[laughing]

21:33.392 --> 21:37.094
I think I just figured out
why they call her Shreeka.

21:37.096 --> 21:40.230
Uh-oh, the building
is starting to give way!

21:40.232 --> 21:42.266
Quick!
The construction elevator!

21:42.268 --> 21:44.201
I hope this elevator's
going down.

21:46.338 --> 21:48.539
The Turtles are excaping!

21:48.541 --> 21:50.807
We'll see about that!

21:51.709 --> 21:53.777
[Leonardo]
She's melting the cable.

21:53.779 --> 21:54.811
Be honest.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.213
We're done for,
aren't we?

21:56.215 --> 21:58.248
There are still
a few ninja tricks

21:58.250 --> 21:59.249
we haven't shown you.

21:59.251 --> 22:01.051
Climb onto my back
and hold on!

22:01.053 --> 22:03.654
Like this?
Perfect.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.489
Okay, fellas, jump!

22:08.326 --> 22:11.761
Oh! I wouldn't
have believed it
if I hadn't seen it!

22:11.763 --> 22:13.163
Now run, everyone!

22:20.671 --> 22:21.905
Oh, well.

22:21.907 --> 22:24.408
Who needed
a new office anyway?

22:24.410 --> 22:27.978
<i>[Shreeka]</i>
<i>I'll still have</i>
<i>my final revenge, Krang.</i>

22:27.980 --> 22:29.612
<i>And I warn you,</i>

22:29.614 --> 22:31.281
<i>it's a fate</i>
<i>worse than death.</i>

22:31.283 --> 22:33.349
Oh, really, Shreeka?

22:33.351 --> 22:36.119
And exactly what
did you have in mind?

22:36.121 --> 22:39.823
I'm returning
Rocksteady and Bebop.

22:39.825 --> 22:43.660
[both screaming]

22:43.662 --> 22:45.862
[sobbing]
Oh, no! Not that!

22:45.864 --> 22:48.565
Anything but that!

22:50.000 --> 22:52.536
April, you will be
happy to learn

22:52.538 --> 22:54.337
that the Turtles
finally agreed

22:54.339 --> 22:55.738
on your
birthday present.

22:55.740 --> 22:58.075
[All]
Happy Birthday, April!

22:58.077 --> 22:59.576
[April]
A pizza?

22:59.578 --> 23:01.211
Oh, for sure, dudette.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.313
It's the gift
that keeps on giving.

23:03.315 --> 23:06.049
Yeah, it keeps on
giving heartburn.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.051
[all laugh]
