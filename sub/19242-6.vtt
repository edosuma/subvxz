01:02.353 --> 01:04.355
He grew up very well though.

01:06.524 --> 01:09.069
He's carrying out
his parents' goodwill, too.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.406
How amazing.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.335
You disappeared, So-joon.

01:28.129 --> 01:30.673
<i>I met you a year from now,</i>
<i>in winter, Mister.</i>

01:33.384 --> 01:34.594
<i>I had disappeared.</i>

01:35.553 --> 01:37.555
<i>We were no longer in touch</i>
<i>with each other.</i>

01:38.556 --> 01:40.558
<i>There was something off</i>
<i>about your.</i>

01:42.352 --> 01:45.355
<i>March 25, 2019, my last day...</i>

01:47.148 --> 01:49.400
<i>The future me, who can tell</i>

01:49.943 --> 01:52.654
<i>if Ma-rin and I will avoid</i>
<i>that accident, disappeared.</i>

01:54.489 --> 01:58.243
<i>First, I need to figure out</i>
<i>why I disappeared.</i>

01:59.619 --> 02:01.830
<i>Contact me as soon as you see this.</i>

02:43.830 --> 02:45.957
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you inside?

02:46.291 --> 02:47.417
I'm waiting for you.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.215
I still feel
like this house is yours.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.093
I didn't want to go in alone.

02:59.554 --> 03:02.265
Should we put up a sign saying,
"Flower's House?"

03:04.559 --> 03:06.394
I just wanted to wait for you.

03:17.739 --> 03:20.200
-Realtor! Get over here.
<i>-A big truck arrived at night.</i>

03:20.366 --> 03:21.201
Hurry.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.493
Is something going on?

03:22.577 --> 03:23.828
Come and watch the news.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.414
-News?
-It's something important.

03:26.497 --> 03:29.167
<i>...donated 500 bags of rice.</i>

03:30.084 --> 03:33.254
<i>For 12 years now,</i>
<i>an anonymous individual...</i>

03:33.338 --> 03:34.839
What? Do you know who it is?

03:36.132 --> 03:38.885
No, I just think
it's such a good thing to do.

03:38.968 --> 03:41.554
<i>-We don't know who it is.</i>
-I wanted to watch it with you.

03:41.638 --> 03:45.850
<i>In respect to the donor's wish,</i>
<i>we will give it to those most in need.</i>

03:45.934 --> 03:47.310
Oh my!

03:48.061 --> 03:52.148
This person could've leaked the identity
at the district office.

03:52.273 --> 03:54.651
That person is clamping their mouth shut
like a clam.

03:55.151 --> 03:56.903
It's freaking awesome.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.533
Don't you think
they would want to tell someone?

04:02.617 --> 04:05.245
It's only natural for a person
to want to be praised.

04:06.746 --> 04:08.331
People can follow their nature.

04:08.873 --> 04:11.626
You sure enjoy watching the news.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.336
It's really nothing.

04:16.422 --> 04:19.008
Maybe it's because it's not much.

04:19.550 --> 04:22.512
The humble heart thinking,
"I can give this much."

04:23.805 --> 04:25.431
How freaking humble.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.643
Why is everything "freaking?"

04:28.768 --> 04:30.228
Talk nicely okay?

04:31.020 --> 04:32.522
Don't criticize so much.

04:33.022 --> 04:34.983
It makes me feel
like I'm being controlled.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.819
I'm just saying to think of my ears.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.697
I'm not the type to think before I speak.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.824
I sometimes regret what I say.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.868
Anyway, that's not what's important.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.788
I was really touched by that news story.

04:49.497 --> 04:53.459
Seeing people help others
behind the scenes...

04:54.043 --> 04:55.211
how should I put it?

04:56.129 --> 04:58.089
It makes me think they're like Batman.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.134
Batman protects the city of Gotham.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.928
Those people protect this country.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.055
Let's go sleep. I want to lie down.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.098
Do you want to?

05:07.932 --> 05:09.517
Okay. Let's go sleep.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.562
You must be so tired. Let's go in.

05:18.484 --> 05:22.113
Did he have to hide his identity
like that?

05:25.491 --> 05:26.743
Batman.

05:27.618 --> 05:30.079
He made his own life that way.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.540
Why would people dislike bats?

05:32.999 --> 05:35.376
They're really cute if you look at them.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.173
They hide and live in caves.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.051
That's why people think they're creepy.

05:44.510 --> 05:47.138
Isn't that because they stick
here and there?

05:47.472 --> 05:49.265
They don't.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.018
They have good personalities.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.979
That's why they're friendly
with birds and mice.

05:55.855 --> 05:56.814
That's a prejudice.

05:57.231 --> 06:01.194
You want them to have just wings,
or just legs. Isn't that it?

06:02.904 --> 06:05.073
It's hard enough to understand you.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.576
I don't know
why I need to understand a bat.

06:09.952 --> 06:11.245
No, it's just...

06:12.413 --> 06:16.793
I'm just saying, is it necessary
for Batman to live in hiding?

06:19.212 --> 06:21.714
He must be so lonely
and dying to talk to someone.

06:22.799 --> 06:23.758
I feel sorry for him.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.720
If Batman had a wife,

06:28.179 --> 06:31.349
he could say "I'm Batman,"
revealing himself

06:32.016 --> 06:33.601
and talk about the Joker together.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.063
He could've rounded off that way.

06:38.523 --> 06:41.859
He could tell at least his wife, right?

06:45.988 --> 06:47.865
Are you sleeping or just pretending?

06:51.077 --> 06:53.079
You can tell me everything.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.500
You sure are amazing.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.169
Good man.

07:02.171 --> 07:03.005
Sleep.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.367
Let's find a different model.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.744
I'll get you one today.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.913
No, it's okay.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.915
I'm not okay. Why do you keep saying okay?

07:37.999 --> 07:40.543
You know
I don't like being in the pictures.

07:41.919 --> 07:43.045
Who else is there?

07:43.129 --> 07:45.506
Before getting married,
even though you hated it,

07:45.590 --> 07:47.091
you modeled for a shopping mall.

07:47.633 --> 07:51.304
You let me take pictures.
You've changed now that we're married?

07:51.387 --> 07:54.098
-No...
-I'm a caught fish, is that it?

07:55.349 --> 07:57.685
Are you going to make sashimi out of me?
Is that it?

07:57.768 --> 07:59.896
Ah... no.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.191
Okay. Let's go.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.026
Let's do it.

08:08.112 --> 08:10.031
I'm not doing it. Let's leave.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.826
Do your shopping
without thinking about me.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.328
I'll be taking pictures.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.705
Mountains, beaches, and the Han River.

08:17.788 --> 08:20.458
There are so many places to take pictures.

08:20.666 --> 08:25.671
You're doing this on purpose
to make me do the grocery shopping!

08:26.547 --> 08:28.424
Doing two things at once?

08:28.508 --> 08:31.219
Put the camera down. Stop.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.804
Let me just do it once.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.723
Oh, I just can't.

08:35.806 --> 08:37.183
Let's just do this once.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.480
Hello, Ma'am.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.273
How much is this belt fish?

08:44.357 --> 08:45.191
Excuse me?

08:45.525 --> 08:46.776
This belt fish.

08:47.902 --> 08:50.613
This is a mackerel.
The belt fish is over there.

08:50.905 --> 08:54.033
You must not know the difference
between the two.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.994
Oh my! This young man is so cute.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.040
Says the lady who puts
pork in seaweed soup.

09:02.959 --> 09:03.793
Realtor.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.798
You couldn't tell a date from a chestnut.

09:09.131 --> 09:11.926
You don't know the difference
between belt fish and mackerel.

09:12.009 --> 09:14.512
I told you that I'm not good
with agricultural goods.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.848
Yes, these are my style.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.226
I wonder what's in them.

09:20.351 --> 09:22.645
What are you doing? Posing?

09:22.853 --> 09:24.855
Yes, so take the picture quickly.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.861
Good enough, right? Okay.

09:32.697 --> 09:35.074
Do you have to take more? Gosh!

09:35.491 --> 09:36.367
This is nuts.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.996
So awkward.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.039
I can't do this, even with an iron face.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.209
I look good with a full face shot,

09:45.626 --> 09:46.961
so get one of those.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.720
Oh, I can't do this. So awkward!

09:56.470 --> 09:58.639
Let's stop now and shop for real, okay?

10:01.017 --> 10:02.643
What are you doing, Ma-rin?

10:04.437 --> 10:05.313
Just...

10:06.439 --> 10:07.773
seeing what you look like.

10:09.358 --> 10:14.071
Looking at what kind of man
I've promised my life to.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.451
This is getting so awkward,
so please stop.

10:19.076 --> 10:20.411
Stop, please.

10:20.494 --> 10:23.748
Please. Let's stop, okay?

10:26.375 --> 10:27.627
A long time ago,

10:28.085 --> 10:30.671
I said this to a photographer
who looked down on me.

10:32.965 --> 10:36.135
That I want to take pictures
because what you see is not everything.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.931
What you see is not always real.

10:42.058 --> 10:45.561
Everyone has something inside
that they don't show people.

10:46.687 --> 10:50.274
I want to show
what is real in my pictures.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.905
I want to continue taking pictures of you.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.744
-You want to take my picture so badly?
-Yes.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.215
Were you that easy of a woman?

11:14.882 --> 11:16.801
I can't let that happen.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.553
Make sure you have no issue
with portrait rights.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.390
What's with you?
Why are you playing hard to get?

11:23.015 --> 11:25.351
<i>Who puts their husband's pictures</i>
<i>in a portfolio?</i>

11:25.434 --> 11:28.896
-Does she think this is social media?
<i>-</i>Oh, this is her husband?

11:28.979 --> 11:30.272
-Yes.
-I see.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.608
There are pictures of others, too.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.402
The theme of the pictures is people.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.405
I felt it was very warm,
and suited us well.

11:37.488 --> 11:40.616
You see? I told you.
Stop making conclusions.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.079
-Next one.
-Okay.

11:48.165 --> 11:49.250
It's good.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.713
Forget it. We don't need to see it.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.089
You did a useless thing.

11:55.965 --> 11:59.719
You should tell her no
because her concept didn't suit us.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.388
Manager Cheon is too nice
to say it.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.307
I could take better pictures on my phone.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.855
Excuse me.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.316
Hello, Sir.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.152
Hi. Welcome.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.319
-Sit down.
-Thank you.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.904
What brings you here?

12:19.822 --> 12:21.240
I called her.

12:21.323 --> 12:24.160
I told her to come by and talk with us.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.663
-It's been a long time.
-It has.

12:28.497 --> 12:30.624
Hello, I'm the photographer, Song Ma-rin.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.877
Hello, I'm Cheon Min-joon.

12:33.377 --> 12:35.880
-You were looking at my pictures.
-They turned out well.

12:36.422 --> 12:39.467
You had such personal photos
in your portfolio.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.928
I was taken aback.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.936
I don't really have much to say.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.440
You came all this way, but...

12:54.523 --> 12:58.027
The Happiness homepage said,

12:59.403 --> 13:03.908
"Families that cannot share a meal
because they have no home."

13:05.034 --> 13:07.661
"Families who have no choice
but to live apart"

13:09.163 --> 13:11.957
Happiness is an organization
that exists for people like that.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.125
So?

13:14.376 --> 13:17.379
That is why the theme of my portfolio
is people.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.716
And I put pictures of the person
that I love.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.470
If I happen to take pictures here,

13:25.054 --> 13:26.806
it will not be about the houses.

13:27.389 --> 13:30.184
It will be about the happy families

13:30.267 --> 13:31.769
that can be together.

13:32.686 --> 13:36.607
I wanted to take pictures of people,
not houses.

13:38.108 --> 13:41.487
I can understand what you intended.

13:42.571 --> 13:43.614
I don't get it.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.870
You'll lose your luck
if you shake your leg.

13:55.376 --> 13:57.336
NAMYEONG

14:06.178 --> 14:08.472
Realtor. Where are you?

14:08.681 --> 14:09.598
<i>Me?</i>

14:10.850 --> 14:11.725
At work.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.102
<i>Then I'll go there now.</i>

14:13.435 --> 14:14.520
<i>Let's meet for a bit.</i>

14:14.770 --> 14:16.105
<i>I have good news.</i>

14:16.188 --> 14:17.523
I have to go to a meeting.

14:17.648 --> 14:18.983
<i>You don't have five minutes?</i>

14:19.066 --> 14:20.359
No, I can't right now.

14:21.443 --> 14:23.779
I'm going to be donating
my photography skills.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.116
I'm going to take pictures for Happiness.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.243
What? Happiness?

14:30.911 --> 14:33.163
Okay. Yeah, I understand.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.040
I'll see you at home. Pop!

14:38.627 --> 14:40.296
What is that? Pop?

14:40.963 --> 14:42.089
Why is he so childish?

14:42.756 --> 14:45.050
I told him I'm working here.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.553
He should be surprised, touched, or happy.

14:47.887 --> 14:52.057
Shouldn't he feel one of those things?
What is pop? How childish is that?

14:52.933 --> 14:54.101
You're still here?

14:54.184 --> 14:55.019
Sorry.

14:55.477 --> 14:56.770
You haven't left?

14:56.896 --> 14:59.064
Yes. I was about to leave.

14:59.773 --> 15:01.150
Did you have a good talk?

15:01.734 --> 15:02.610
Yes.

15:02.693 --> 15:03.569
Well...

15:04.278 --> 15:06.864
Should we go to a sunny place
and have some tea?

15:08.073 --> 15:09.158
Yes, that sounds good.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.619
There's a nice terrace.

15:12.077 --> 15:12.953
Let's go.

15:18.542 --> 15:22.755
I felt like I brought up
something I shouldn't have.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.381
I worried about it.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.052
About his relationship with Happiness...

15:28.844 --> 15:32.014
I told you
before So-joon told you about it.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.016
I felt like that was a mistake.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.355
Were you hurt by it?

15:41.315 --> 15:43.400
I was a little surprised.

15:47.655 --> 15:52.952
Honestly, I also first heard
about So-joon's parents from you.

15:54.036 --> 15:54.912
Oh, really?

15:57.998 --> 16:00.334
I'm confused about

16:00.709 --> 16:02.336
why he wants to hide it from me.

16:04.129 --> 16:07.257
I thought it must be hard for him
to talk about it himself.

16:08.342 --> 16:11.220
Others might not understand, but I do.

16:14.181 --> 16:18.560
I was also a survivor
of the Namyeong accident, like him.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.274
There was an article about me recently,
I guess you didn't know.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.443
I had no idea.

16:26.527 --> 16:27.361
Yes.

16:30.614 --> 16:33.993
Anyway, So-joon has overcome everything.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.745
He's doing good things in life now.

16:37.454 --> 16:40.332
I want to be able to help him a little
if I can.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.251
Okay.

16:44.461 --> 16:47.131
I'm so glad we'll be working together.

16:48.048 --> 16:50.926
I really like your pictures, Ma-rin.

16:52.636 --> 16:53.929
Thank you.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.100
By the way, were you the only one

16:58.851 --> 17:01.020
who knew about So-joon's secret?

17:01.228 --> 17:02.187
Oh, that?

17:02.980 --> 17:07.067
Se-young and Ki-doong don't know, do they?

17:09.153 --> 17:10.279
Of course not.

17:10.779 --> 17:13.949
It's a secret he couldn't tell me.
How could he have told his friends?

17:14.950 --> 17:16.618
Yes... of course.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.947
I don't understand this.

18:14.301 --> 18:17.429
<i>Ki-doong. This is So-joon from the past.</i>

18:18.597 --> 18:21.058
<i>I need to ask you something. Call me.</i>

18:55.843 --> 18:57.177
<i>It took three years.</i>

18:58.720 --> 19:01.473
<i>Getting over, and even enjoying a bit,</i>

19:01.807 --> 19:04.017
<i>the pain and discomfort of time travel.</i>

19:06.228 --> 19:10.399
<i>Learning how to go to a day</i>
<i>that I wanted took three years.</i>

19:11.150 --> 19:13.485
<i>I was so tired</i>
<i>of what I went through back then.</i>

19:13.861 --> 19:16.864
<i>I never rode the subway</i>
<i>more than twice a day.</i>

19:19.366 --> 19:22.035
<i>Today, I don't think I have a choice.</i>

19:24.246 --> 19:27.166
<i>When and why did I disappear?</i>

19:29.126 --> 19:31.670
<i>I need to search time again and again.</i>

19:32.754 --> 19:34.464
<i>I have to find traces of myself.</i>

20:17.591 --> 20:18.550
<i>It's here.</i>

20:26.516 --> 20:27.893
<i>Mister's identity?</i>

20:28.352 --> 20:31.063
<i>Why did he teach me about time travel?</i>

20:31.647 --> 20:33.148
<i>Why did he approach me?</i>

20:34.816 --> 20:36.318
<i>Director Kim Yong-jin?</i>

20:38.028 --> 20:39.571
<i>Director Kim Yong-jin.</i>

20:48.580 --> 20:51.041
I'll call a designated driver tonight.

20:51.124 --> 20:52.334
Hwang, you can go.

20:52.876 --> 20:54.753
I'll leave the keys
at the counter.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.296
-Okay.
-Bye.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.881
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.092
I'm thankful for that.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.594
Okay.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.349
Who is he meeting in secret?

21:10.060 --> 21:10.978
Hello.

21:11.728 --> 21:12.688
I'm Kim Yong-jin.

21:12.771 --> 21:16.858
I know you're busy. You came a long way.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.404
Ah, yeah.

21:21.154 --> 21:22.948
I don't have a business card.

21:24.616 --> 21:28.328
Honestly, I was surprised
to hear from you.

21:28.829 --> 21:32.708
-You're an investor of Chairman Yu's?
-Well...

21:32.791 --> 21:35.961
I saw you in Yu So-joon's office
a few days ago.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.005
-Yes, I remember.
-Yes.

21:39.423 --> 21:41.883
Can I speak openly?

21:42.426 --> 21:45.762
I think we could become partners.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.516
Mom, I know that.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.727
No, you don't need to be sorry.

21:52.894 --> 21:55.272
Sending Ki-young
to graduate school is too much.

21:55.397 --> 21:58.942
I supported her college,
and studying abroad. I can't do more.

21:59.026 --> 22:02.112
You don't need to say sorry
because I'm done.

22:04.031 --> 22:04.906
I'm hanging up.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.536
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

22:09.619 --> 22:10.537
You called?

22:10.620 --> 22:14.833
I called many times and you ignored me,
in the other world.

22:14.916 --> 22:18.337
Gosh, are you calling me
in the other world too?

22:18.420 --> 22:21.340
Don't call me.
My life will get complicated, too.

22:22.549 --> 22:28.013
I just want to live a normal
and regular life. You know that.

22:28.096 --> 22:29.848
It was my first time.

22:30.390 --> 22:31.558
It was urgent.

22:32.809 --> 22:34.895
Do you have medicine for a headache?

22:35.020 --> 22:36.938
No. Why? You have a headache?

22:37.105 --> 22:38.440
It's just...

22:39.024 --> 22:40.942
I went on the subway too much.
It's tiring.

22:42.235 --> 22:44.237
Don't worry about me, and do your stuff.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.198
I'll just rest a little and go.

22:46.281 --> 22:47.407
About Ma-rin...

22:49.326 --> 22:52.996
How long do you think you can hide this?
It's uncomfortable for you too.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.164
Do you have to hide it?

22:54.247 --> 22:56.208
Ma-rin might actually like it.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.710
It's not quite so simple.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.545
It could be that simple.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.092
If she knows I can go to the future,

23:05.425 --> 23:07.969
Ma-rin would be curious
about our future.

23:08.178 --> 23:10.806
You could tell her a vague, good version.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.392
To do that...

23:15.519 --> 23:16.978
To tell her a good version,

23:18.146 --> 23:22.984
we... don't have a great future, Ki-doong.

23:35.330 --> 23:37.040
<i>The day I went missing</i> <i>seems to be</i>

23:37.624 --> 23:39.334
<i>November 30.</i>

23:40.585 --> 23:44.297
<i>Why did I leave Ma-rin and disappear?</i>

23:46.633 --> 23:48.510
November 30.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.722
That's not even three months away.

24:07.571 --> 24:08.405
Realtor?

24:09.823 --> 24:11.658
-You're home!
-Yes.

24:12.159 --> 24:14.619
Where did you disappear like that earlier?

24:15.328 --> 24:16.163
What?

24:16.496 --> 24:18.915
You went "pop" and hung up.

24:19.749 --> 24:22.836
Oh, I must've been in a meeting.

24:23.879 --> 24:24.838
Ow!

24:25.338 --> 24:26.298
That scared me.

24:26.673 --> 24:29.676
It was in storage, so I brought it out.

24:30.343 --> 24:31.178
It's so cute.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.263
We have all sorts of things at home.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.099
You don't even know
what you have?

24:36.600 --> 24:37.476
I guess not.

24:37.767 --> 24:40.187
I told you,
I have many friends in research.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.814
Your friend in research
gave you this, too?

24:43.398 --> 24:44.941
This is really amazing.

24:45.192 --> 24:48.778
If you throw trash at it,
it comes to eat it up like a dog.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.030
Watch this.

24:54.075 --> 24:55.243
Go get it.

25:00.248 --> 25:01.166
Look.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.752
Eat this too.

25:16.765 --> 25:17.974
Aren't you going to rinse?

25:20.560 --> 25:23.688
Now that you're watching,
it feels weird to spit.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.149
You can rinse first.

25:29.653 --> 25:33.949
It's not so lovely like in the movies.

25:34.449 --> 25:35.325
You see?

25:36.034 --> 25:38.161
We don't need to brush our teeth together.

25:46.628 --> 25:51.091
How come you're not saying anything
about me working at Happiness?

25:54.719 --> 25:56.638
Aren't you just helping out one time?

25:59.266 --> 26:00.559
Yes, you're right.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.270
Do a good job and don't cause trouble.

26:03.770 --> 26:05.814
Jeez, I won't.

26:07.566 --> 26:08.483
But, you know...

26:09.818 --> 26:13.405
I want to continue my working relationship
with Happiness.

26:14.656 --> 26:16.408
I really like the board director.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.201
Se-young's dad?

26:18.868 --> 26:20.996
Yes, I really like him.

26:23.957 --> 26:26.167
He didn't mention anything else?

26:27.752 --> 26:28.878
Like what?

26:30.297 --> 26:31.923
Nothing. Just asking.

26:34.092 --> 26:36.011
You don't have anything to tell me?

26:38.513 --> 26:39.514
Ma-rin.

26:40.932 --> 26:43.101
If I happened to disappear one morning,

26:44.144 --> 26:45.145
what would you do?

26:46.271 --> 26:48.982
What else would I do?
I would just have to wait.

26:50.025 --> 26:51.109
Why do you ask?

26:52.068 --> 26:52.902
Just because.

26:53.903 --> 26:55.071
I was suddenly curious.

26:59.868 --> 27:00.702
Ma-rin.

27:03.580 --> 27:06.416
Let's live together a long, long time.

27:08.001 --> 27:10.045
Even if we get angry, disappointed,

27:10.712 --> 27:11.921
or sick of one another,

27:12.881 --> 27:16.718
as if we've been inseparable since birth,

27:17.552 --> 27:19.179
stay right by my side.

27:20.889 --> 27:21.723
Me?

27:22.557 --> 27:24.059
Do you like me that much?

27:25.685 --> 27:29.147
If you disappear from my side...

27:31.566 --> 27:33.068
I might go crazy.

27:39.616 --> 27:41.201
You're already crazy.

27:41.951 --> 27:43.745
You've fallen hard for Bap-soon.

27:46.373 --> 27:49.167
I'm calling myself Bap-soon. Seriously.

27:49.584 --> 27:51.795
Hi. Where's Bap-soon?

27:52.504 --> 27:54.297
She can't come because she's busy.

27:54.464 --> 27:56.841
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

27:56.925 --> 27:58.593
I even canceled my facial.

27:58.677 --> 27:59.636
I came for no reason.

28:00.929 --> 28:03.556
Why are you dying to see Ma-rin lately?

28:04.140 --> 28:06.434
-She's just being a helpful wife.
-What?

28:07.102 --> 28:08.728
You're doing this for your husband.

28:08.812 --> 28:11.439
Ma-rin's husband is the chairman
of her husband's company.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.149
Oh, you're right.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.902
A person's life can change so suddenly.

28:16.569 --> 28:19.781
We're going to keep seeing one another.
I want to be on good terms.

28:20.615 --> 28:21.783
Also, you guys!

28:22.367 --> 28:24.994
Think about it if you have any brains.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.289
If Chairman Yu was normal at all,

28:28.373 --> 28:30.750
with all that wealth and those looks,
at that age,

28:31.167 --> 28:34.295
why would he marry Bap-soon,
let alone date her?

28:34.754 --> 28:37.132
There you go saying mean things again.

28:38.258 --> 28:42.220
There's already a lot of rumors
about what a mystery he is.

28:42.470 --> 28:45.807
No one knows
about his family or background.

28:45.974 --> 28:48.518
He must be from abroad.

28:48.685 --> 28:50.520
No, that's not it either.

28:51.438 --> 28:53.940
He appeared out of nowhere one day

28:54.023 --> 28:56.025
and started making money.

28:57.360 --> 29:01.156
No one knows where he rolled in from.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.241
No one knows his roots.

29:04.033 --> 29:05.201
Isn't it weird?

29:06.453 --> 29:08.538
This is planning material for a brochure.

29:08.621 --> 29:10.832
-You can get the concept from this.
-Okay.

29:11.624 --> 29:14.377
Have you worked this way before?

29:16.379 --> 29:19.507
I've done some work
for pet and garden magazines.

29:19.632 --> 29:22.510
-I know what you're going for.
-You have a lot of experience.

29:23.178 --> 29:27.682
It also would be great to keep the concept
you mentioned before, Artist Song.

29:28.266 --> 29:29.225
About the people.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.020
Artist Song?

29:33.688 --> 29:36.566
I'm sorry. I've never been called
an artist before.

29:37.984 --> 29:41.070
I'm really going to work hard this time.

29:41.154 --> 29:42.947
I'll do my best to help.

29:43.031 --> 29:44.199
Yes, please.

29:44.282 --> 29:45.200
Read this.

29:47.869 --> 29:48.745
You're here?

29:49.996 --> 29:50.830
Yes.

29:51.790 --> 29:52.916
Song Ma-rin.

29:54.292 --> 29:57.670
I'm in the middle of a conversation,
so I'll talk to you later.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.091
Do you want to have a drink?

30:07.847 --> 30:09.849
It seems you have a misunderstanding.

30:10.558 --> 30:11.893
It takes me a while to warm--

30:11.976 --> 30:13.436
I take a long time to warm up.

30:13.561 --> 30:15.396
It must have been uncomfortable for you.

30:17.190 --> 30:19.859
-I'm not uncomfortable--
-You don't need to be.

30:24.906 --> 30:27.158
Let's be honest.

30:28.201 --> 30:29.744
You have a problem with me.

30:32.038 --> 30:33.039
You hate me.

30:34.457 --> 30:37.210
You even saved me as Bap-soon
on your phone.

30:38.545 --> 30:39.546
I took a peek.

30:41.422 --> 30:44.050
Even so, no need to be so blunt.

30:44.133 --> 30:45.718
Are you trying to pick a fight?

30:46.135 --> 30:49.013
Wasn't it you
who wanted to speak honestly?

30:54.978 --> 30:56.855
You don't need to be taken aback.

30:56.938 --> 30:59.816
I grew up
reading many negative comments.

31:00.316 --> 31:03.361
I don't really get hurt by people
who hate me.

31:07.365 --> 31:10.368
It's true that I don't really like you.

31:11.870 --> 31:12.829
You?

31:12.912 --> 31:17.500
But, aren't you curious
about why I don't like you?

31:18.126 --> 31:19.252
Not at all.

31:20.128 --> 31:23.339
I have no interest in people
who don't like me.

31:36.060 --> 31:36.936
Gosh.

31:38.813 --> 31:40.106
We should drink together.

31:51.075 --> 31:53.202
You are really something, aren't you?

31:53.953 --> 31:55.496
What did you say to me?

31:56.039 --> 31:58.833
-Se-young!
-You're making me crazy.

31:59.500 --> 32:00.585
Hey, Shin Se-young.

32:01.961 --> 32:02.879
Se-young.

32:03.630 --> 32:04.505
Goodness.

32:04.589 --> 32:07.508
-So-joon.
-How much wine did she have?

32:08.009 --> 32:09.469
Hey, are you okay?

32:10.094 --> 32:12.513
Where did Ma-rin go?
Is she in the bathroom?

32:12.597 --> 32:14.807
-Take Song Ma-rin, would you?
-Huh?

32:15.266 --> 32:17.310
Get her out of my sight.

32:17.435 --> 32:18.311
Hey.

32:18.770 --> 32:22.231
-Where is she? Where did she go?
-Pull yourself together.

32:22.815 --> 32:24.984
-Did she leave? Did she?
-What?

32:25.401 --> 32:26.653
Did she go home?

32:27.362 --> 32:29.322
She's probably home. I'll look for her.

32:29.697 --> 32:32.241
You don't even get drunk often.

32:32.325 --> 32:34.452
How did you get so drunk? Are you okay?

32:39.666 --> 32:42.543
Don't touch me. You're married.

32:42.627 --> 32:44.754
You're married. Don't touch her.

32:44.837 --> 32:45.672
Hey, Ki-doong.

32:45.755 --> 32:47.757
What's wrong with her?

32:47.840 --> 32:49.092
How much did she have?

32:49.175 --> 32:50.927
Se-young, are you okay?

32:51.260 --> 32:52.762
She's totally drunk.

32:52.845 --> 32:54.889
-I better look for Ma-rin.
-Okay.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.849
So, Manager Kang.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.268
You can take her home, right?

33:01.020 --> 33:02.355
Yes, Chairman.

33:02.438 --> 33:04.315
You are so trustworthy.

33:06.192 --> 33:07.402
You are so handsome.

33:08.528 --> 33:09.821
Get home safe, Chairman.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.448
Why do we live like this?
It's so not cool.

33:12.949 --> 33:14.283
Take good care of Se-young.

33:14.367 --> 33:16.119
I've always lived like this.

33:17.286 --> 33:18.246
Hey, are you okay?

33:19.122 --> 33:20.873
Wait!

33:21.749 --> 33:22.709
I'm sorry.

33:25.294 --> 33:29.507
She was just goading me on.

33:31.217 --> 33:33.636
I can't really pinpoint.

33:34.095 --> 33:36.889
You know those that drive people crazy?

33:38.057 --> 33:41.144
Gosh, she's not a normal girl.

33:41.227 --> 33:42.520
Yeah, she's not normal.

33:42.603 --> 33:44.188
How could she knock you down?

33:44.272 --> 33:46.149
I missed a fun show, right?

33:46.232 --> 33:49.110
Who did what to me?

33:49.193 --> 33:50.028
Okay.

33:51.112 --> 33:53.865
Fine. Now you are on her side.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.992
-What are you talking about?
-Fine!

33:57.326 --> 33:58.578
Are you all right?

34:01.372 --> 34:02.582
Yu So-joon.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.918
Why did you marry Bap-soon?

34:06.961 --> 34:08.755
She's totally weird!

34:09.047 --> 34:12.300
That woman is bad for you!

34:12.592 --> 34:15.928
-Do you see me as So-joon?
-You don't have eyes for girls.

34:16.179 --> 34:18.848
Thank you for that,
but I'm not So-joon, okay?

34:18.973 --> 34:20.683
Nice taste you have in women...

34:21.476 --> 34:23.728
Hey, look at me.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.440
Aren't I better than her?

34:27.815 --> 34:30.485
-Look at me.
-Yes, Se-young is the best.

34:30.818 --> 34:32.320
But, you should stop drinking.

34:32.403 --> 34:34.614
You're always drinking these days.
It's not good.

34:34.989 --> 34:36.657
You should recognize me, at least.

34:42.413 --> 34:43.831
So...

34:47.001 --> 34:50.046
are you happy with her?

34:53.341 --> 34:54.634
Are you dying of joy?

34:55.718 --> 34:57.220
Yu So-joon, you bastard.

35:03.309 --> 35:04.393
Realtor.

35:06.062 --> 35:08.022
Are you playing hide and seek with me?

35:10.566 --> 35:14.320
I wanted to do that at home.

35:15.321 --> 35:16.906
Here I come!

35:21.202 --> 35:22.870
I found you!

35:23.621 --> 35:24.539
Not here.

35:25.581 --> 35:28.501
Then, where are you?

35:29.585 --> 35:32.296
I found you... not.

35:32.380 --> 35:33.631
Where are you?

35:38.469 --> 35:41.764
Realtor, it's no fun
if you play like this.

35:41.889 --> 35:42.807
I...

35:46.352 --> 35:48.354
Were you cleaning?

35:48.813 --> 35:49.772
Come here.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.066
You are a part of my family too.

35:52.441 --> 35:54.068
Come here. Come here.

35:54.652 --> 35:56.696
I'll be good to you.

35:57.071 --> 35:58.197
You're so good.

35:58.739 --> 35:59.866
So good.

36:00.032 --> 36:01.492
Wait right here.

36:01.659 --> 36:05.288
I prepared some coins for you.

36:05.371 --> 36:06.414
Look.

36:08.040 --> 36:10.209
The king of coins, 500 won.

36:10.293 --> 36:12.044
No, not now.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.754
I'll do it again.

36:14.589 --> 36:15.798
Get it.

36:17.425 --> 36:20.803
Gosh. You can't go there.

36:20.887 --> 36:21.804
No.

36:22.805 --> 36:25.099
No, sorry but...

36:26.142 --> 36:27.977
What is...

36:29.395 --> 36:30.479
What is this?

36:33.399 --> 36:34.275
What?

36:38.863 --> 36:40.865
This man became the president?

36:42.909 --> 36:45.661
How was there an election
without me knowing about it?

36:46.829 --> 36:48.497
This is a conspiracy.

36:48.664 --> 36:49.957
-Song Ma-rin.
-So scary.

36:51.500 --> 36:54.128
Why didn't you pick up your phone?
I was worried.

36:55.338 --> 36:56.255
Realtor,

36:57.089 --> 36:58.549
something strange happened.

36:59.967 --> 37:01.969
Was there a coup d'etat in our country?

37:02.678 --> 37:03.971
Did our president change?

37:04.055 --> 37:06.182
What are you talking about?

37:06.265 --> 37:08.059
You must be very drunk.

37:08.726 --> 37:12.355
It says we elected a new president.

37:12.855 --> 37:14.607
RYU SUN-KWANG
ELECTED 19TH PRESIDENT!

37:14.690 --> 37:18.527
You must be very drunk. Let me see.

37:21.530 --> 37:23.199
He wasn't elected.

37:23.282 --> 37:27.161
It says "will be elected?"
with a question mark.

37:27.662 --> 37:30.122
"Will be elected?" Question mark.

37:31.040 --> 37:31.999
That's what it says.

37:32.583 --> 37:33.417
Where?

37:33.668 --> 37:34.961
I don't see that.

37:35.044 --> 37:38.172
There hasn't been an election.
Does that make sense?

37:38.881 --> 37:39.882
No,

37:40.258 --> 37:41.509
I can see it right here.

37:42.551 --> 37:45.554
-President elected!
-Question mark.

37:45.805 --> 37:46.764
How many fingers?

37:47.306 --> 37:49.350
-Five.
-It's four.

37:49.433 --> 37:54.313
If you get drunk and see things,
don't you know it scares me?

37:54.814 --> 37:57.233
Were you always so inconsiderate?

37:59.277 --> 38:00.444
Are you scared for me?

38:01.904 --> 38:03.489
I'm scared for this country.

38:05.032 --> 38:05.992
Let's sleep.

38:06.075 --> 38:09.745
You just need to get sleep.

38:09.829 --> 38:12.290
Ma-rin is the prettiest when she sleeps.

38:12.373 --> 38:14.917
Oh, you reek of alcohol!

38:26.137 --> 38:27.096
It's raining.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.825
Why did he lie?

38:47.908 --> 38:50.077
It says "will be elected?"

38:50.161 --> 38:51.787
Look. "Elected?"

38:51.871 --> 38:54.915
"Will be elected?" Question mark.

38:56.959 --> 38:58.711
What was that election about?

39:07.553 --> 39:09.513
I just can't understand it.

39:11.098 --> 39:13.017
Am I still drunk?

39:16.062 --> 39:17.313
No.

39:18.105 --> 39:20.191
I never black out when drunk.

39:22.610 --> 39:24.779
It's very weird.

39:30.743 --> 39:32.078
Take this. You'll need it.

39:32.161 --> 39:33.621
They said it wouldn't rain.

39:34.580 --> 39:37.333
<i>By chance, it could rain.</i>

39:37.875 --> 39:38.918
It really is amazing.

39:39.001 --> 39:42.004
How are you always more precise
than the weather forecast?

39:42.463 --> 39:43.631
What is this?

39:43.714 --> 39:47.593
<i>Oh that! My friend is a researcher</i>
<i>at a ramen company.</i>

39:58.896 --> 40:00.064
No.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.066
It's from his researcher friend.

40:02.566 --> 40:03.984
Researcher friend?

40:05.069 --> 40:07.571
So-joon doesn't have
any friends in research.

40:09.490 --> 40:10.449
No.

40:11.575 --> 40:13.202
Think straight.

40:14.703 --> 40:16.539
-What are you doing there?
-Goodness!

40:17.081 --> 40:18.082
What?

40:18.416 --> 40:21.377
Why are you out here?
Did the thunder scare you?

40:22.837 --> 40:23.671
No.

40:23.754 --> 40:25.673
What's with the honorifics suddenly?

40:26.090 --> 40:27.508
Come back. Let's sleep.

40:31.804 --> 40:33.472
<i>It was a paper from this winter.</i>

40:33.556 --> 40:35.224
I saw it with my own eyes.

40:36.225 --> 40:40.354
Then is Realtor riding around
in a time machine or something?

40:40.688 --> 40:44.692
-He brought it from the future?
-I'm being serious.

40:46.110 --> 40:46.944
Sorry.

40:50.364 --> 40:54.118
Since he is in business,
he could know researchers.

40:54.326 --> 40:55.494
They could be clients.

40:56.495 --> 40:59.331
I tried to think, "There must be a reason,

40:59.415 --> 41:00.708
and I'm overreacting."

41:00.791 --> 41:02.793
If I don't think that way,
there's no answer.

41:06.088 --> 41:08.257
I don't want to say it outright.

41:09.842 --> 41:11.844
But it seems like he's hiding something.

41:13.012 --> 41:14.722
And he has so many secrets.

41:18.350 --> 41:22.021
I thought he was Batman,
but now I think he's Hong Gil-dong.

41:24.106 --> 41:28.319
If he's making money doing bad things
to do good, that could be a problem.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.155
What are you talking about?

41:31.489 --> 41:34.658
Oh! I don't even know anymore.

41:35.326 --> 41:38.704
Realtor has a way of making me
weird and complicated.

41:40.206 --> 41:42.124
You've always been odd.

41:43.834 --> 41:45.544
But since you brought it up,

41:46.337 --> 41:47.880
Gun-sook said something.

41:48.881 --> 41:54.011
Your husband is famous in the industry
for being a mystery.

41:54.678 --> 41:57.431
Was it not enough to insult me?
She's insulting Realtor?

41:57.515 --> 42:01.060
She says it's weird
that he rushed into marrying you.

42:04.188 --> 42:06.607
You don't need to worry about
what Gun-sook says.

42:09.860 --> 42:10.903
Do you feel bad?

42:11.695 --> 42:12.530
No.

42:13.364 --> 42:15.324
I did think that was strange too.

42:15.407 --> 42:17.701
There's so much you think is strange.

42:18.911 --> 42:21.622
Just ask him directly if you're curious.

42:22.331 --> 42:24.667
What's there to hide when you're married?

42:27.378 --> 42:28.587
I can, right?

42:38.973 --> 42:42.893
<i>Who would you save first</i>
<i>if Batman and Hong Gil-dong were drowning?</i>

42:43.477 --> 42:44.937
<i>I'm asking who you like better.</i>

42:49.358 --> 42:51.110
-Oh, Chairman!
-Hello.

42:51.193 --> 42:53.862
It's about to time to eat Bap.

42:54.905 --> 42:56.907
Oh, we're banned from saying that.

42:57.241 --> 42:58.867
I forgot. I apologize.

42:58.951 --> 43:01.996
Please have some sense
and keep that to yourself.

43:02.079 --> 43:02.955
Yes.

43:03.414 --> 43:07.209
Did you see that land management plan
the Ministry of Infrastructure released?

43:07.459 --> 43:12.256
It said they will build 7,000 units
in Dong-seong city.

43:12.339 --> 43:14.592
I put in an order for a trip there.

43:14.758 --> 43:17.011
Wow, you are on top of things.

43:18.095 --> 43:20.097
-Hey.
-Let's talk.

43:25.060 --> 43:27.021
Aren't going to say hello
to Director Wang?

43:27.646 --> 43:28.981
That guy...

43:30.482 --> 43:31.942
I am the chairman, after all.

43:32.693 --> 43:33.527
You...

43:35.362 --> 43:36.989
Be careful about saying "Bap."

43:37.489 --> 43:38.365
Yes, sir.

43:39.950 --> 43:41.535
Are you mad at me or something?

43:42.411 --> 43:43.746
Did I upset you?

43:43.829 --> 43:46.582
Why do something I didn't ask for?
You figured I'd thank you?

43:47.499 --> 43:48.417
Ah... that.

43:48.500 --> 43:51.920
Why would you send money to my family
without telling me?

43:52.588 --> 43:54.840
I heard Ki-young wants to go
to a graduate school.

43:55.007 --> 43:56.342
I heard you on the phone.

43:56.467 --> 43:58.761
Did I ask you for it?
Did I ask you for money?

43:58.844 --> 44:01.096
Do you feel cool
if you secretly give me money?

44:02.973 --> 44:04.141
I'm giving it back.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.226
Don't ever do it again.

44:07.936 --> 44:10.147
I've been living at your place.

44:10.397 --> 44:11.857
Think of it as rent.

44:16.070 --> 44:17.071
Must be easy.

44:18.113 --> 44:21.367
I'm sure it's easy for you,
giving Ki-young money for school.

44:21.659 --> 44:25.579
It's so hard for my family,
but it's so easy for you.

44:27.122 --> 44:28.999
But, money that you throw so easily...

44:30.501 --> 44:32.002
is appreciated, but annoying.

44:36.131 --> 44:38.217
Are you laughing right now?

44:38.759 --> 44:40.344
You're a bit of a douchebag today.

44:43.222 --> 44:45.307
Don't be like that, not between us.

44:45.391 --> 44:47.393
Oh, you're making me so angry.

44:48.477 --> 44:50.729
It's a difficult issue
and hard to talk about.

44:51.480 --> 44:53.232
Do you think I feel proud about it?

44:53.816 --> 44:57.111
I've been careful too
as I don't want you to be uncomfortable.

44:58.278 --> 45:00.072
Is it right to pretend not to know?

45:00.155 --> 45:02.533
It's for Ki-young's education.

45:04.702 --> 45:06.537
You really leave me speechless.

45:06.620 --> 45:08.122
I really hate it.

45:08.414 --> 45:09.248
Come on, Ki-doong.

45:09.331 --> 45:11.500
What are you doing? It's gross.

45:11.583 --> 45:14.002
-Don't be mad, Ki-doong.
-Stop it. It's annoying.

45:14.086 --> 45:17.339
-Ki-doong.
-Stop!

45:17.965 --> 45:19.174
Okay, okay.

45:19.508 --> 45:23.011
Then let me ask you for a favor, Ki-doong.

45:25.305 --> 45:29.101
Let's meet at your house
on December 3rd this year.

45:30.394 --> 45:31.228
Why?

45:31.770 --> 45:34.565
I want to tell you what it's all about.

45:36.150 --> 45:38.193
But I don't want to complicate your life.

45:38.694 --> 45:41.196
But I have something I need to ask you.

45:42.281 --> 45:45.868
Please be home that day,
no matter what.

45:46.535 --> 45:47.953
I'll explain it to you then.

45:49.872 --> 45:51.081
What took you so long?

45:51.582 --> 45:53.751
You've become really close to me lately.

45:54.334 --> 45:56.253
Oh, is So-joon not home yet?

45:56.795 --> 45:58.630
I was going to stay for dinner.

45:58.964 --> 46:00.841
Tell me before you come next time.

46:01.967 --> 46:04.720
I don't mind, since you're my mom.

46:04.928 --> 46:08.682
But if you keep barging in like this,
So-joon will be annoyed.

46:09.558 --> 46:10.434
Oh yeah?

46:11.185 --> 46:14.146
Then should I just move in
so that we can get more friendly?

46:14.229 --> 46:17.483
-What?
-I want to live freely alone.

46:17.858 --> 46:19.902
But you have all these rooms.

46:20.360 --> 46:22.529
If I don't use them, who will?

46:23.697 --> 46:26.492
Why do you think I moved out with no money
at the age of 20?

46:28.076 --> 46:30.704
-Because you're immature?
-No.

46:30.996 --> 46:32.498
Because you're independent?

46:32.581 --> 46:35.209
You don't like this.
Why do you pretend not to understand?

46:36.376 --> 46:39.671
Stop saying nonsense
and go home early today.

46:40.297 --> 46:41.965
I have lots to discuss with So-joon.

46:45.135 --> 46:46.929
<i>I have something I need to ask you.</i>

46:47.971 --> 46:51.266
<i>Please be home that day, no matter what.</i>

46:52.100 --> 46:53.477
<i>I'll explain it to you then.</i>

46:59.024 --> 47:02.152
<i>Let's meet at your house</i>
<i>on December 3rd this year.</i>

47:08.826 --> 47:14.248
DECEMBER 3, 2016, FUTURE

47:40.524 --> 47:41.608
You really came.

47:42.985 --> 47:45.279
You know who I am, right?

47:47.281 --> 47:48.115
Yes.

47:48.740 --> 47:51.535
We agreed to meet on December 3rd.

47:52.744 --> 47:53.662
Yeah.

47:54.162 --> 47:57.249
It's awkward meeting you like this.

47:58.625 --> 48:00.627
-Are you doing well?
-Yes.

48:10.429 --> 48:12.681
I disappeared, Ki-doong.

48:14.766 --> 48:16.268
I knew that's why you would come.

48:18.145 --> 48:19.605
What happened to me?

48:20.355 --> 48:21.315
What happened?

48:21.481 --> 48:23.692
Don't worry.
It wasn't an accident or anything.

48:24.276 --> 48:26.111
Right? It wasn't.

48:26.945 --> 48:28.280
-Then why?
-You...

48:30.073 --> 48:31.408
went abroad.

48:32.576 --> 48:33.827
You broke up with Ma-rin.

48:37.456 --> 48:38.290
What?

48:38.373 --> 48:41.418
Things weren't good between you two
since you got married.

48:43.211 --> 48:44.254
Does that make sense?

48:44.379 --> 48:46.089
We just got married.

48:46.798 --> 48:49.676
You shouldn't play a joke like this

48:49.760 --> 48:52.304
-on a friend who came from afar.
-I'm sorry.

49:03.023 --> 49:08.403
Did Ma-rin find out
about me being a time traveler?

49:08.528 --> 49:10.405
I don't know about your relationship.

49:10.530 --> 49:11.782
All I know is

49:12.324 --> 49:16.036
you suddenly left to go abroad
after breaking up with Ma-rin.

49:17.537 --> 49:20.040
You and Ma-rin never registered
your marriage.

49:20.832 --> 49:22.042
Where did I go?

49:23.001 --> 49:26.171
I don't know that.
I haven't been in touch with you either.

49:27.506 --> 49:28.382
Wait.

49:29.091 --> 49:31.802
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

49:31.885 --> 49:33.595
You're not messing with me, are you?

49:34.304 --> 49:35.597
I wouldn't do that.

49:36.807 --> 49:40.936
No matter how bad
my relationship got with Ma-rin,

49:41.520 --> 49:43.355
I would never run off on my own.

49:43.855 --> 49:45.941
There's a reason
why I could never do that.

49:46.024 --> 49:49.778
I... I'm very sorry to tell you this.

49:51.113 --> 49:53.073
Break up with Ma-rin when you go back.

49:54.157 --> 49:56.034
For your sake, and Ma-rin's sake.

49:57.411 --> 49:59.121
This is all I can say to you.

50:04.418 --> 50:05.836
Don't say that nonsense.

50:19.850 --> 50:20.851
He's late.

50:21.435 --> 50:22.519
He's not even calling.

50:24.229 --> 50:25.897
Is So-joon staying out all night?

50:26.898 --> 50:28.900
Are you planning to stay out
all night here?

50:30.527 --> 50:31.695
He called.

50:32.195 --> 50:33.947
He went to see some land.

50:34.031 --> 50:34.990
Oh, really?

50:36.033 --> 50:38.035
Give me some pajamas.

50:40.662 --> 50:41.997
You're going to sleep here?

50:42.330 --> 50:45.250
My gosh. Are you going to sleep alone
in this big house?

50:45.333 --> 50:46.752
Put it back on. It's scary.

50:46.835 --> 50:48.295
I'll wear it out. It's okay.

51:02.017 --> 51:03.810
The subway is closed for the night.

51:33.632 --> 51:35.258
Why am I looking at this?

51:35.550 --> 51:37.135
No one would call.

52:16.133 --> 52:19.928
Hey! Are you okay?

52:20.011 --> 52:21.721
Miss, are you okay?

52:21.805 --> 52:23.265
-I'm okay.
-Okay.

52:23.348 --> 52:24.349
Thank you.

52:24.808 --> 52:26.601
Wait, wait.

52:27.769 --> 52:29.604
Where have I seen you before?

52:30.021 --> 52:31.523
I've seen your face before.

52:33.650 --> 52:36.194
Oh, you're Bap-soon!

52:37.195 --> 52:38.196
Bap-soon!

52:38.864 --> 52:39.698
Bap-soon!

52:40.323 --> 52:41.741
-Who are you?
-Leave quietly.

52:42.909 --> 52:45.328
Who are you? What is it?

52:49.749 --> 52:50.917
Damn it.

53:11.021 --> 53:12.022
<i>Where are you?</i>

53:13.440 --> 53:15.150
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

53:46.806 --> 53:48.475
<i>I'll stay up and wait.</i>

53:48.767 --> 53:49.893
<i>Come home soon.</i>

54:11.623 --> 54:14.334
How could he stay out all night
without one phone call?

54:18.380 --> 54:20.382
I won't look so shabby.

54:21.549 --> 54:22.509
Yes.

54:28.014 --> 54:30.016
The weather is so nice.

54:30.892 --> 54:34.437
Looking at you now reminds me
of when I was young.

54:34.521 --> 54:35.730
I looked just like you.

54:36.481 --> 54:38.066
I've seen all your pictures.

54:38.275 --> 54:39.109
When?

54:39.442 --> 54:41.444
If you look deep, you're hidden in me.

54:41.611 --> 54:43.238
You are in me.

54:43.697 --> 54:44.656
I'll be going now.

54:45.490 --> 54:48.201
Oh my! Son!

54:48.326 --> 54:49.828
Oh! My son!

54:50.829 --> 54:52.038
You went to look at land?

54:52.122 --> 54:52.998
Hello!

54:53.832 --> 54:56.876
You couldn't come home
because you're working so hard!

54:57.127 --> 54:59.504
Mom respects you so much, Son.

54:59.671 --> 55:02.215
Thank you. I'll be going to Ma-rin.

55:02.299 --> 55:04.217
By the way, Son...

55:05.135 --> 55:07.387
You should think of your health
and sleep at home.

55:07.470 --> 55:09.347
Mom worries about you, okay?

55:09.431 --> 55:11.558
-All right. Go on home.
-Okay.

55:14.227 --> 55:15.145
Ma-rin!

55:16.730 --> 55:17.564
Ma-rin!

55:20.317 --> 55:21.609
Oh, hello.

55:22.444 --> 55:23.445
It's been a long time.

55:23.695 --> 55:25.655
Something came up yesterday.

55:26.281 --> 55:27.115
It's okay.

55:28.283 --> 55:30.243
You didn't want to come home,
so you didn't.

55:30.368 --> 55:31.202
It's up to you.

55:31.286 --> 55:33.413
It wasn't on purpose.

55:34.706 --> 55:35.707
Did I say something?

55:36.750 --> 55:39.919
There's no law that you can't stay out
all night after you're married.

55:40.670 --> 55:42.839
I don't want to pry
into your private life.

55:43.715 --> 55:46.343
It's nice to get some exercise for once.

55:52.682 --> 55:53.641
See you later.

55:54.809 --> 55:56.019
So scary.

55:57.270 --> 55:58.646
You said you're okay.

55:58.730 --> 56:00.523
How is using separate rooms okay?

56:00.607 --> 56:03.693
It's nice to have freedom
and be cool about it.

56:03.777 --> 56:06.404
I drank at Ki-doong's and passed out.

56:06.488 --> 56:08.281
I woke up and it was morning.

56:08.365 --> 56:09.282
Don't tell me.

56:09.783 --> 56:11.576
I'm trying not to be curious.

56:13.036 --> 56:16.498
Whether you come home or not,
I don't want to waste my life,

56:16.873 --> 56:20.126
nagging and prying into your life.

56:20.960 --> 56:22.837
So, let's each live our lives freely.

56:24.214 --> 56:27.509
Oh... Should we postpone
our marriage registration?

56:28.009 --> 56:29.969
Everyone does it a year
after the wedding.

56:31.388 --> 56:32.639
All I know is

56:33.181 --> 56:37.394
you suddenly left to go abroad
after breaking up with Ma-rin.

56:39.062 --> 56:41.523
You and Ma-rin didn't even register
your marriage.

56:44.859 --> 56:46.319
Do you have to go this far?

56:46.778 --> 56:48.196
It was one mistake.

56:49.989 --> 56:51.908
I'm working at Happiness.

56:52.784 --> 56:54.327
I'm starting next week.

56:58.206 --> 57:00.417
I said I'm working at Happiness.

57:03.795 --> 57:04.796
Yu So-joon.

57:05.880 --> 57:07.924
Do you really have nothing to say to me?

57:10.051 --> 57:12.053
I heard you started that organization.

57:15.640 --> 57:18.643
I didn't think I needed to tell you.

57:20.603 --> 57:22.105
If I wanted to hide it,

57:22.439 --> 57:24.232
I wouldn't have let you work there.

57:25.024 --> 57:26.860
Still, I wanted you to tell me.

57:27.944 --> 57:30.947
I thought
I at least meant that much to you.

57:34.284 --> 57:36.703
There are many things about you
that make me curious.

57:36.786 --> 57:38.329
But I can't ask you.

57:38.997 --> 57:41.040
I feel like you're always hiding things.

57:41.666 --> 57:43.042
I feel afraid to ask.

57:44.711 --> 57:46.671
Is this all I am to you?

57:47.422 --> 57:49.340
If I really am hiding something,

57:50.091 --> 57:52.135
it's because
I don't want to hurt you.

57:52.552 --> 57:54.387
Because it wouldn't do you any good.

57:56.681 --> 57:58.308
So, there is something.

57:58.391 --> 58:00.059
What could there be?

58:00.518 --> 58:02.687
No one is one hundred percent honest.

58:03.605 --> 58:05.064
Can I know everything about you?

58:05.648 --> 58:07.108
I can't know everything.

58:07.192 --> 58:08.276
That's how it is.

58:09.152 --> 58:10.570
The important thing is...

58:11.613 --> 58:14.407
The only thing in my head is

58:14.699 --> 58:17.869
how we will live a good life together
for a long time.

58:21.539 --> 58:24.209
All I worry about is our future.

58:25.126 --> 58:26.461
Why are you getting so angry?

58:27.378 --> 58:32.050
I just don't like you having secrets
and it hurts my feelings.

58:32.800 --> 58:36.095
That's all. I don't know
why you're talking about other things.

58:36.721 --> 58:40.558
You're working hard to live well,
so I shouldn't stress you out. Is that it?

58:41.059 --> 58:43.228
-You know that's not what I meant.
-No!

58:44.521 --> 58:46.064
That's basically what you said.

58:46.898 --> 58:48.775
You're really treating me like Bap-soon.

59:11.214 --> 59:12.257
<i>Where are you?</i>

59:12.382 --> 59:14.300
<i>I'll stay up and wait. Is something wrong?</i>

59:14.384 --> 59:16.844
<i>It's 2:00 a.m. Hurry home.</i>
<i>Are you in like a funeral?</i>

59:16.928 --> 59:18.805
<i>If you're busy, just text me a period.</i>

59:18.888 --> 59:20.807
<i>I'm worried.</i>
<i>Fine. Do whatever you want.</i>

59:20.890 --> 59:23.977
<i>I'm going to sleep, so don't call.</i>
<i>I couldn't sleep a wink.</i>

59:24.102 --> 59:26.145
<i>You went too far. Delete all my texts.</i>

59:26.563 --> 59:28.481
<i>I'm not going to worry about you anymore.</i>

59:32.318 --> 59:33.611
Oh, gosh.

59:39.284 --> 59:41.286
I did go home yesterday.

59:42.996 --> 59:45.248
I waited outside a long time
in the cold weather.

59:46.874 --> 59:50.295
Let's emigrate.
Think about it once, seriously.

59:50.378 --> 59:53.339
That's nonsense.
Why do you want to emigrate?

59:53.631 --> 59:55.883
Everyone emigrates these days.

59:55.967 --> 59:57.885
Let's live the American dream.

59:57.969 --> 59:59.637
I don't care which country.

59:59.721 --> 1:00:00.805
How can you not care?

1:00:00.888 --> 1:00:03.474
If you want the American dream,
you go to America.

1:00:03.558 --> 1:00:05.977
You have no idea,
so why do you want to emigrate?

1:00:06.769 --> 1:00:08.479
I just made a mistake.

1:00:09.105 --> 1:00:13.484
I'm okay with any country
that doesn't have cockroaches.

1:00:13.568 --> 1:00:14.944
I can live well. I really can.

1:00:15.028 --> 1:00:19.490
Lee Gun-sook, there are no countries
without cockroaches.

1:00:20.700 --> 1:00:21.618
There aren't?

1:00:23.411 --> 1:00:25.330
Is this because of Bap-soon again?

1:00:25.413 --> 1:00:28.041
Is your pride hurt so bad
that you can't stand it?

1:00:28.124 --> 1:00:30.918
-You're too embarrassed to live here?
-No.

1:00:32.295 --> 1:00:34.422
It's not just that.

1:00:34.672 --> 1:00:37.634
It upsets me that you work
for that young kid.

1:00:37.925 --> 1:00:39.677
Lee Gun-sook, look at me.

1:00:40.595 --> 1:00:41.804
I told you, right?

1:00:41.888 --> 1:00:44.849
I will have you be called
a chairman's wife.

1:00:46.684 --> 1:00:47.602
Look at me.

1:00:48.478 --> 1:00:49.729
Do I seem flaky to you?

1:00:51.898 --> 1:00:53.691
Aren't you underestimating me too much?

1:00:55.109 --> 1:00:57.570
What is it?
You're going to start a business?

1:00:58.321 --> 1:00:59.197
Anyway...

1:00:59.947 --> 1:01:03.326
just know you will soon become
a chairman's wife.

1:01:03.409 --> 1:01:04.952
Don't bring up emigrating.

1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:07.080
Get me a coffee.

1:01:08.289 --> 1:01:11.042
-Hot and strong.
-Okay.

1:01:19.300 --> 1:01:22.303
I can invest about 10 billion won.

1:01:22.387 --> 1:01:25.223
That's what I can access right away.

1:01:25.348 --> 1:01:29.477
But why are you making me this offer
and not Chairman Yu?

1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:31.896
I heard that you're better.
What reason is there?

1:01:31.979 --> 1:01:33.064
I want to make money.

1:01:33.147 --> 1:01:34.148
Right.

1:01:35.650 --> 1:01:37.026
You're doing well. Keep going.

1:01:40.988 --> 1:01:42.073
Just keep going.

1:02:08.599 --> 1:02:10.643
<i>Sorry. Crying face.</i>

1:02:17.442 --> 1:02:19.944
<i>Crying face? Are you pretending to cry?</i>

1:02:20.611 --> 1:02:21.612
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

1:02:26.325 --> 1:02:27.577
<i>That's not what I meant.</i>

1:02:28.035 --> 1:02:29.787
<i>I meant that I am sincerely sorry.</i>

1:02:30.747 --> 1:02:31.748
<i>Sweating smile.</i>

1:02:34.041 --> 1:02:35.084
<i>You're smiling?</i>

1:02:35.501 --> 1:02:37.670
<i>-You must feel relaxed.</i>
-That wasn't...

1:02:40.798 --> 1:02:42.300
SINCERELY

1:02:45.303 --> 1:02:47.889
THAT'S NOT IT.
I AM SINCERELY APOLOGIZING.

1:02:48.097 --> 1:02:50.933
<i>I don't know if this can end</i>
<i>with an apology text.</i>

1:03:16.042 --> 1:03:17.001
Sorry.

1:03:17.627 --> 1:03:18.878
Don't talk to me.

1:03:25.009 --> 1:03:25.927
Where are you going?

1:03:27.094 --> 1:03:28.888
What? I'm just...

1:03:28.971 --> 1:03:31.474
Where are you going?
There's no dust there.

1:03:33.518 --> 1:03:34.769
Why are you so careless?

1:03:36.229 --> 1:03:38.773
Hey! I said where are you going?

1:03:42.485 --> 1:03:44.737
I'll be back in five minutes.

1:03:54.997 --> 1:03:56.499
Why is he acting so poor?

1:03:57.583 --> 1:04:00.211
I want to smoke.

1:04:07.426 --> 1:04:08.344
Mister.

1:04:10.096 --> 1:04:11.514
Mister, is that you?

1:04:18.646 --> 1:04:20.648
What is he doing out there?

1:04:21.607 --> 1:04:22.775
What are you doing there?

1:04:24.986 --> 1:04:25.903
Are you a spy?

1:04:29.949 --> 1:04:30.783
Hi.

1:04:32.785 --> 1:04:34.036
It is you.

1:04:35.496 --> 1:04:38.541
I couldn't get in touch with you.
What are you doing here?

1:04:39.500 --> 1:04:41.002
I came to see if you were okay.

1:04:41.460 --> 1:04:42.712
You should have called.

1:04:43.170 --> 1:04:44.630
Did you see my letter?

1:04:45.214 --> 1:04:46.173
Yeah, I did.

1:04:47.258 --> 1:04:49.343
You saw it and didn't even call?

1:04:53.639 --> 1:04:54.640
Who is that?

1:04:55.141 --> 1:04:56.100
Mister.

1:04:57.476 --> 1:05:00.605
You said my life would reset
once I got married.

1:05:01.731 --> 1:05:03.900
That my future would change, right?

1:05:04.233 --> 1:05:05.067
I did.

1:05:06.694 --> 1:05:11.365
I think my future has become more twisted
than it was.

1:05:37.141 --> 1:05:39.894
<i>Because I get to know how screwed up</i>
<i>my future will be.</i>

1:05:39.977 --> 1:05:43.397
<i>The more you try to know,</i>
<i>you make it worse for both of you.</i>

1:05:43.481 --> 1:05:46.651
<i>I didn't need anything else.</i>
<i>I just wanted you.</i>

1:05:46.734 --> 1:05:49.612
<i>Your husband is cheating.</i>
<i>Who cares if it's a man or a woman?</i>

1:05:49.695 --> 1:05:51.739
<i>You just have to catch him.</i>

1:05:51.822 --> 1:05:55.868
<i>What if we're complicating our fate</i>
<i>to change the future?</i>

1:05:56.160 --> 1:05:58.371
<i>Maybe we rushed into marriage.</i>

1:05:58.454 --> 1:06:00.164
<i>Maybe I made a mistake.</i>

1:06:00.289 --> 1:06:03.501
A time slipper, I'm a time traveler.

1:06:05.252 --> 1:06:07.254
