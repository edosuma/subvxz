I guess maybe we're not
the only guests?

you'll be the first casualty.

14:20.610 --> 14:21.986
And you'll be the second.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.279
Your guests might be
third and fourth,

first and second.

get you folks a drink?

anything else?

- Uh, gin, please.

who brought us all together.

15:45.487 --> 15:46.821

his many accomplishments

15:46.863 --> 15:48.448

I don't think he would've ever
guessed that you two

15:49.908 --> 15:52.369

to organize his archives.

more of that shrimp?

15:57.749 --> 15:59.334
And I'll grab another whisky.
Thanks, chief.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.586

how to control their liquor.

they figure it out

to get wasted.

with me?

- Who you were whispering with.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.256
She's beautiful.

- Nah. That was... a ghost.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.350
I hope you don't mind me
saying this,

17:38.391 --> 17:39.976
but your husband is a touch
condescending.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.855

17:43.897 --> 17:45.273

But the story of his life
needs to be told by an insider.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.919
A more objective one, perhaps.
Not his ex-wife.

in her old house,

18:09.673 --> 18:11.758
working side by side
with the new wife

18:11.800 --> 18:13.593
to organize his legacy.

18:13.635 --> 18:17.305
Someone could make a documentary
about this right here.

very interesting.

18:38.993 --> 18:41.413

a documentary about Archie?

18:41.454 --> 18:43.790
- No one in their right mind.

18:43.832 --> 18:46.793
- This is
a money-laundering scheme.

that because he met me

wearing nothing but feathers,

18:53.550 --> 18:55.468
It's almost endearing.

of the meal.

Well, you wanna walk?

I'm fine with that.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.362
If someone tries to kidnap me,

I was almost raped

19:15.864 --> 19:16.948
by my math teacher once,

19:18.033 --> 19:19.159
but my vaginal muscles
clamped down on his dick,

19:19.200 --> 19:20.910
making it impossible for him
to withdraw

19:20.952 --> 19:22.579
for almost two hours.

It's an ultra-rare condition

- Right.

But the penis captivus thing
is legit.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.922

fascinating inside your head
