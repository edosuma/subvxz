M_I_SForEver

01:06.166 --> 01:09.202
<i>For years I was
frustrated by what seemed to be</i>

01:09.236 --> 01:14.308
<i>the insurmountable barriers between the
world as it is and the world I wanted.</i>

01:15.577 --> 01:17.377
<i>So, I began making a website</i>

01:17.411 --> 01:19.714
<i>where people could buy and sell
anything anonymously.</i>

01:19.747 --> 01:22.215
He's on the move,
got his laptop with him.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.585
<i>Which way is he coming?</i>

01:25.485 --> 01:26.521
Right at you.

01:27.287 --> 01:29.891
<i>Blue hoodie, jeans, flip-flops.</i>

01:29.924 --> 01:32.326
<i>On foot, westbound
towards the target location.</i>

01:32.359 --> 01:34.361
<i>I'm letting him go,
confirm when you have a visual.</i>

01:35.162 --> 01:37.331
<i>I knew the state
might try to impede it.</i>

01:37.364 --> 01:39.433
<i>But if we never try
for fear of retribution,</i>

01:39.466 --> 01:41.636
<i>then we've already lost,
you know?</i>

01:45.305 --> 01:47.374
<i>Silk Road is about
something much bigger</i>

01:47.407 --> 01:49.510
<i>than thumbing your nose
at the man.</i>

01:51.311 --> 01:53.648
<i>It's about
taking back our liberty.</i>

01:54.582 --> 01:59.353
<i>And as corny as it sounds,
I just wanna look back at my life</i>

01:59.386 --> 02:02.824
<i>and know that I did something
that helped people.</i>

02:03.390 --> 02:06.393
Nobody moves until my go.
He doesn't log in, we abort.

02:06.426 --> 02:08.895
- <i>Copy.</i>
- And I repeat, he closes the laptop,

02:08.930 --> 02:10.898
<i>the data's encrypted
and we got shit.</i>

02:10.931 --> 02:12.232
<i>Roger that, out.</i>

02:13.133 --> 02:15.570
<i>Everybody on point
here, heads on a swivel.</i>

02:30.985 --> 02:33.821
<i>Aggress, collapse and contain.
Stand by for takedown.</i>

02:37.959 --> 02:39.927
Hey, who the fuck
is calling him?

02:46.734 --> 02:47.769
Hello?

03:22.335 --> 03:23.437
Keep it running.

03:23.470 --> 03:24.572
I'll be here.

03:31.713 --> 03:33.748
Fuck this fucking shit.

03:45.325 --> 03:46.694
- How you doing?
- Hey.

03:47.929 --> 03:49.931
Uh, give me
a pack of Camels, please.

03:49.964 --> 03:51.298
Mm.

03:52.499 --> 03:53.601
Something else?

03:58.973 --> 04:00.842
Mints. You got any mints?

04:00.875 --> 04:02.710
Yeah, right behind
you, lower shelf.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.650
Rick Bowden. What's up, yo?
When you get out?

04:09.684 --> 04:12.520
'- Cause I heard you was in the...
- booby hatch.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.956
First off, Rayford,
I was in, uh...

04:16.057 --> 04:17.692
I was in rehab,
not a psych ward.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.291
Oh, well,
I heard it was rehab,

04:19.326 --> 04:20.392
then it was a psych ward.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.461
Really?

04:21.963 --> 04:23.531
Yeah, who told you that?

04:24.665 --> 04:26.000
Clocked your digital footprint.

04:30.004 --> 04:32.305
Well, it was good to see you, brother.

04:32.339 --> 04:33.741
I ain't
your fucking brother.

04:33.775 --> 04:35.543
Oh, why you
do me like that, yo?

04:35.576 --> 04:36.844
We... We friends, right?

04:36.878 --> 04:38.045
I don't have fucking friends,

04:38.079 --> 04:39.412
I have informants.

04:43.117 --> 04:45.520
Oh, fuck this dude, I'm...

04:45.553 --> 04:48.388
- Your cigarettes?
- I don't want no fucking cigarettes, man.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.094
Motherfucker so angry, yo.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.494
Get all kinds in here.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.064
Where them
hot Cheetos at, bro?

05:01.368 --> 05:04.404
Unless you're a postal worker,
you're not allowed to dress like one,

05:04.437 --> 05:05.506
even on Halloween.

05:06.607 --> 05:09.977
Defacing the dollar bill,
consorting with a known pirate.

05:10.011 --> 05:13.380
Technically, these are all
crimes against the state.

05:13.413 --> 05:16.684
Right now there are
5,000 criminal statutes.

05:16.717 --> 05:19.086
And that's just at the national level.
Forget about the states.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.523
Well, until 1967,
it was illegal

05:22.557 --> 05:25.793
for a white man to marry a Black
woman in the state of Virginia.

05:26.227 --> 05:29.831
In 14 other states, including the
great state of Texas, mind you,

05:29.864 --> 05:34.635
it was illegal for two people to
have consensual sodomy until 2002.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.905
America has lost its compass,
man.

05:37.939 --> 05:40.373
If you wanna fall in love with
someone who doesn't look like you

05:40.407 --> 05:43.476
or have sex with somebody who does,
that is your inalienable right.

05:45.412 --> 05:47.014
I thought we were
talking about Obamacare.

05:47.048 --> 05:49.449
What the fuck
are you talking about?

05:49.482 --> 05:52.687
Look, it doesn't matter how
well-intentioned the president is, man.

05:52.720 --> 05:56.657
The state cannot legislate what
the person can and can't do.

05:56.691 --> 05:58.159
It is un-American.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.861
And next, they're gonna
come for our guns

05:59.894 --> 06:01.696
and giving them
to the border crossers.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.463
Am I right?

06:03.496 --> 06:04.866
Uh, who the fuck
is this guy?

06:04.899 --> 06:06.901
Case in point.
A perfect stranger

06:06.934 --> 06:08.903
wants to butt in
on a private conversation

06:08.936 --> 06:13.074
between friends with an
inane, ignorant non sequitur,

06:13.107 --> 06:15.776
his right to do so
is constitutionally-protected.

06:16.277 --> 06:18.646
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

06:18.679 --> 06:19.714
You believe this asshole?

06:19.747 --> 06:20.948
Well, the First Amendment.

06:27.822 --> 06:28.923
Out of your league.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.060
Wanna dance?

06:34.528 --> 06:35.730
No one else is.

06:37.031 --> 06:38.099
Exactly.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.510
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.713
Uh, we were
gonna pick you up.

06:52.747 --> 06:54.815
I didn't want
Edie to see me in that place.

06:56.550 --> 06:57.585
Okay.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.922
- Welcome home.
- Ah.

07:01.488 --> 07:03.724
- Hey, so we are clear...
- Daddy! Hey!

07:03.758 --> 07:07.128
- Oh!
- Hey! Look who's here!

07:07.628 --> 07:10.665
I missed my peanut.
Oh, come here.

07:13.601 --> 07:16.938
Come here, let me look at you.
I missed you.

07:16.971 --> 07:18.471
I missed you more.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.475
You're just beautiful.
You sure are.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.680
Come on,
let's just take these inside.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.014
Let's go and make necklaces,
come on.

07:27.048 --> 07:28.649
Let's do matching ones,

07:28.683 --> 07:29.984
let's do two yellows,
two blues. Yeah?

07:30.017 --> 07:31.118
Okay.

07:31.819 --> 07:32.853
House looks good.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.088
You look good.

07:36.090 --> 07:37.124
Huh?

07:38.025 --> 07:39.126
Two yellows.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.697
What's that? Huh?

07:42.730 --> 07:44.699
Come on, I thought we said
we were gonna do matching.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.667
- It's matching. Isn't it?
- No, it's not.

07:46.701 --> 07:49.036
We got a green and a brown.

07:49.870 --> 07:53.074
What did... Should we do two
browns and two greens then, yeah?

07:53.107 --> 07:54.141
Sure.

07:55.076 --> 07:56.143
You okay?

07:56.844 --> 07:57.912
Yeah.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.185
Matching, isn't it?

08:04.218 --> 08:06.854
Come on, come here.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.622
Sweetie, hey.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.691
You know what'd be super fun?

08:10.725 --> 08:12.927
Do you wanna go set up a tea
party for dad in your room?

08:12.960 --> 08:14.261
He loves tea.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.163
Yeah.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.839
It's a thing. The school called
and we have to get her tested.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.273
- Tested?
- Yeah.

08:26.307 --> 08:27.541
No, we're not
getting her tested.

08:27.575 --> 08:28.943
Are you kidding me? Come on.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.144
Honey, she's a late bloomer.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.612
It's a learning disorder. Rick,

08:31.645 --> 08:33.214
- it's a real thing, okay?
- Oh.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.082
I've been here, okay,
you haven't been here.

08:35.116 --> 08:36.884
I'm the one raising her right now.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.023
Look, honey, you know...

08:43.691 --> 08:45.126
I lost my way a little.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.029
Okay? But I'm back. And I'm...

08:50.131 --> 08:52.233
I'm gonna be here
for you and Edie, okay?

08:52.266 --> 08:53.701
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

08:54.268 --> 08:56.037
Hmm? Hmm?

08:58.072 --> 09:00.074
You do it again,
you don't bother coming back.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.135
Hey.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.738
Two plates?
What are you, a monk?

09:30.771 --> 09:33.040
No,
it's an experiment.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.876
I don't have anything
because I don't need anything.

09:36.310 --> 09:41.615
Okay, well, besides from
living like a homeless person,

09:41.649 --> 09:42.716
what's your deal?

09:43.084 --> 09:44.285
Um...

09:44.318 --> 09:46.020
Well, I'm almost a physicist.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.755
I never quite got to...

09:47.788 --> 09:49.924
- That's not what I mean.
- ...actual physics...

09:53.661 --> 09:55.129
Honestly?

09:55.162 --> 09:56.230
Always.

09:57.031 --> 09:58.099
Okay.

10:01.035 --> 10:05.039
I don't really wanna say.
To be honest, it sounds corny.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.141
Try me.

10:08.209 --> 10:09.877
Okay. Um...

10:12.446 --> 10:15.616
Ever since I can remember,
I've always wanted to change the world.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.219
How?

10:19.220 --> 10:20.621
Um...

10:21.590 --> 10:25.759
Are you familiar with Ludwig von Mises?
Austrian School of Economics?

10:25.793 --> 10:27.128
Um, no.

10:27.161 --> 10:28.262
Okay, most people aren't.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.798
But his ideas are beautiful.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.434
It's like poetry or math.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.035
I'm wilting, Rossman.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.237
Okay.

10:36.270 --> 10:38.305
In a sentence,

10:38.339 --> 10:40.841
every action that we take
outside of government control

10:40.875 --> 10:42.810
strengthens the market
and weakens the state.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.447
Seriously?

10:46.480 --> 10:48.048
Yes.

10:48.082 --> 10:50.017
I just fucked
a libertarian?

10:52.286 --> 10:53.888
Surprise.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.239
Fucking Morales, eh?

11:12.740 --> 11:15.042
<i>Mi hombre,</i> huh.
Come here.

11:20.381 --> 11:24.485
Fucked up out there, Johnny.
I know that.

11:24.519 --> 11:27.821
Well, we kept you in too long.
You went native. That's on us.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.456
No, man, I should've...

11:29.490 --> 11:31.358
I'm a big boy, I can take it.

11:31.392 --> 11:33.327
I should've fucking put
the hand up and said,

11:33.360 --> 11:37.264
"Yo, man, over here. Not fucking...
not waving around."

11:40.067 --> 11:42.903
- So I'll ride the bench a while.
- Rick...

11:42.937 --> 11:45.105
Come on, man, I can work
Bocelli behind a desk, I can...

11:45.139 --> 11:48.108
You wrapped your car around
a tree in Old San Juan, man.

11:48.142 --> 11:50.177
I also took a narco predator
off the streets, too.

11:50.211 --> 11:51.513
You might wanna mention that.

11:51.546 --> 11:53.147
What about
when I listen to the wire,

11:53.180 --> 11:55.015
and then I find out
that the whole thing,

11:55.049 --> 11:58.252
it jumped off because you
told Gomez he was retarded?

12:00.788 --> 12:02.389
I mean, what the fuck,
you know?

12:02.423 --> 12:04.124
You want me to fucking say, man?
You listen...

12:04.158 --> 12:07.228
Rick, maybe I'm not
making myself clear.

12:07.261 --> 12:08.862
No, man,
maybe I'm not makin' myself clear.

12:08.896 --> 12:09.964
- Rick...
- I ride the bench for a while.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.398
You tell me how long...

12:11.432 --> 12:13.535
You were coked
out of your fucking mind,

12:13.568 --> 12:16.237
endangering the lives
of civilians.

12:16.270 --> 12:18.038
You're never
working the streets again.

12:18.072 --> 12:19.273
What the fuck
does that mean?

12:19.306 --> 12:20.474
What do you think
it means?

12:23.244 --> 12:26.780
It's what I do, Johnny.
It's who I am, man, I mean, come on.

12:27.481 --> 12:30.451
Fucking look at me,
I'm a fucking door kicker, man.

12:30.484 --> 12:33.320
Read it. Read this shit.

12:34.054 --> 12:37.559
Fuck sakes, man. The brass,
they wanted you out on your ass.

12:37.592 --> 12:39.893
No pension. No nothing.

12:43.964 --> 12:47.167
You're being reassigned, man.
Cybercrimes.

12:47.201 --> 12:50.037
See GS Shields on Monday.
He'll get you squared away.

13:07.321 --> 13:08.389
Mm.

13:09.557 --> 13:10.858
It was really good.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.996
So how's the book business?

13:17.164 --> 13:18.232
Sold the bus.

13:18.866 --> 13:21.402
Well, that seems
a bit drastic, love.

13:21.435 --> 13:25.105
No, Mom... Good Wagon
just was not the thing.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.042
Really wasn't.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.587
Give her a shot.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.561
Come on.
Let's see if you still got it.

13:47.061 --> 13:48.563
I'm not a trained monkey, Dad.

13:49.664 --> 13:52.166
When Ross was nine,
he was consumed with the idea

13:52.199 --> 13:54.301
of making the Guinness
Book of World Records.

13:54.835 --> 13:57.371
- What was it, eight seconds?
- 6.8.

13:57.404 --> 14:00.140
We trained every day
for three months.

14:00.174 --> 14:06.980
And then the night before,
Ross abruptly decides it wasn't the thing.

14:07.515 --> 14:11.285
PhD, a video game start-up,
now Good Wagon.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.120
Tell me when you see a pattern.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.188
Let's go.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.993
It was really good.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.896
Thanks, honey.
Yeah, it was nice to meet you.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.173
Are you okay?

14:35.008 --> 14:36.043
Yeah.

14:36.611 --> 14:38.178
You sure?

14:38.212 --> 14:41.348
Yes, yes. I'm fine.

14:41.382 --> 14:43.250
Look, just because
your dad's a dick

14:43.283 --> 14:45.085
doesn't mean that you
won't change the world.

14:46.688 --> 14:48.422
I believe in you,
Rossman.

15:35.570 --> 15:36.704
Hey.

15:37.672 --> 15:39.607
I'm after Supervisor Shields.

15:39.641 --> 15:40.974
Yeah, I'm Shields.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.347
Rick Bowden.
Johnny Morales sent me.

15:47.381 --> 15:49.416
It's an honor to meet you, Bowden.
We're glad to have you.

15:49.450 --> 15:51.285
- It's good to be here.
- Yeah.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.287
Yeah, sorry, I'm late.
I hit the range, little tune up.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.455
I gotta re-qualify.

15:54.488 --> 15:55.557
Can I ask you

15:55.590 --> 15:56.624
a personal question, Rick?

15:57.391 --> 15:58.425
Yeah.

15:58.459 --> 15:59.993
Is it true

16:00.027 --> 16:01.395
what happened in,
uh, Puerto Rico?

16:01.428 --> 16:02.996
What part?

16:03.030 --> 16:04.666
Eighteen-month op went sideways

16:04.699 --> 16:07.401
when you told the cartel boss
he was a Mongoloid?

16:09.470 --> 16:13.173
So we got an open floor plan.
Foster inter-squad exchange.

16:13.207 --> 16:15.008
But Johnny said
you were old school.

16:15.042 --> 16:16.611
Thought you might prefer
some privacy.

16:17.077 --> 16:20.481
So we got you in here.
This little number.

16:23.585 --> 16:29.223
We got a series 9, 16 gigs of RAM.
Intel processor. She's a rocket.

16:29.256 --> 16:30.324
RAM up, huh?

16:32.192 --> 16:36.531
Yeah. RAM up. Well,
welcome to Cybercrimes, Bowden.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.540
You can do this.

16:46.073 --> 16:49.711
Okay, real talk.
Good Wagon was never gonna work.

16:49.744 --> 16:52.346
Brick and mortar is dead.
We live in a convenience culture.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.381
Everyone wants everything
shipped to their door.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.383
And Bezos
already beat you to it.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.653
Now,
today's moneymaker is social

16:58.686 --> 17:00.755
because everyone wants to know
what everyone else is up to.

17:00.788 --> 17:03.825
- Like I said it would.
- No. Bullshit. That is bullshit.

17:03.858 --> 17:06.560
People want anonymity.
Now more than ever.

17:06.594 --> 17:10.497
The Internet was spawned off of the
things that people try and keep secret.

17:10.531 --> 17:14.201
Think about it.
Porn, gambling, drugs.

17:14.233 --> 17:17.839
Okay, but you can't buy drugs
on the Internet, Ross.

17:17.872 --> 17:20.440
Hmm.
I've been thinking about this.

17:21.742 --> 17:23.109
What if you could?

17:24.310 --> 17:26.346
Uh, what are you saying?

17:26.380 --> 17:29.751
Think about it.
Amazon for drugs.

17:30.818 --> 17:32.419
You despise Amazon.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.388
But I love freedom.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.423
Yeah, well, whoever does this,

17:36.456 --> 17:38.492
they're an idiot, first off,

17:38.526 --> 17:41.295
and second off, they'd be busted
in, like, two seconds.

17:41.328 --> 17:42.797
Not if
every transaction's encrypted.

17:44.632 --> 17:46.266
What do you know about Tor?

17:46.300 --> 17:47.669
- What, the Onion Router?
- Nothing.

17:48.101 --> 17:50.672
Uh, it was designed by the
spooks at DARPA and the Navy.

17:50.705 --> 17:53.841
It's a network that directs web
traffic through a series of relays.

17:53.875 --> 17:55.142
What for?

17:55.843 --> 17:57.745
Concealing location and usage.

17:57.779 --> 17:59.847
Essentially,
it's a digital invisibility cloak.

18:00.314 --> 18:02.650
It's perfect for doing
business on the Dark Web.

18:02.684 --> 18:06.588
Okay, but if they follow the
money, then you're fucked, right?

18:07.287 --> 18:08.322
Bitcoin.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.490
- Bitcoin.
- Bitcoin?

18:11.258 --> 18:12.292
Bitcoin.

18:12.694 --> 18:14.194
Bitcoin?

18:14.227 --> 18:17.665
It's like tokens in an arcade.

18:17.699 --> 18:19.667
You go into the arcade,
you buy the tokens,

18:19.701 --> 18:22.202
but nobody knows
which tokens you used.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.338
- Okay, it's a little...
- It's completely anonymous transactions.

18:24.371 --> 18:28.175
- Think about it.
- It's a little basic explanation, uh, but...

18:28.208 --> 18:29.242
I like tokens.

18:29.811 --> 18:31.779
And I like drugs.

18:31.813 --> 18:33.915
<i>Okay,
so the first thing you need to do</i>

18:33.948 --> 18:36.818
<i>is go to www.torproject.org.</i>

18:37.719 --> 18:40.788
<i>Go to the link in the description,
guys, click the download Tor button.</i>

18:40.822 --> 18:43.423
Tell me
that's not a YouTube tutorial.

18:43.457 --> 18:46.493
It's not like they're
giving classes at UT, babe.

18:47.028 --> 18:50.197
<i>Welcome to
an introduction to the Internet.</i>

18:50.865 --> 18:52.900
<i>If you're not comfortable
with your computer,</i>

18:52.934 --> 18:55.435
<i>you may need
to play this tape many times.</i>

18:58.506 --> 19:02.275
<i>Using your pointer finger,
rest it on the left button.</i>

19:02.877 --> 19:05.813
<i>Press down
and you will see a menu bar.</i>

19:06.614 --> 19:09.182
<i>Press down
and you will see a menu bar.</i>

19:09.216 --> 19:11.284
<i>Press down
and you will see a menu bar.</i>

19:11.318 --> 19:13.588
- <i>Press down and you will...</i>
- Motherfucker!

19:22.930 --> 19:25.298
<i>I didn't know
you knew how to write code.</i>

19:25.332 --> 19:28.435
<i>I don't,
but I'm teaching myself.</i>

19:29.336 --> 19:32.205
I'm not gonna get up from this
computer until I've mastered it.

19:33.240 --> 19:38.513
All right. Enjoy your nerd shit.
I'm gonna go get tacos.

19:44.719 --> 19:47.522
Where you guys at on Bocelli?
Huh?

19:47.555 --> 19:49.624
- Uh-uh.
- Oh, fuck that, come on, where you at?

19:49.657 --> 19:51.793
It's an eyes-only briefing,
Rick. You know the drill.

19:51.826 --> 19:54.227
Boss, we could really use one of
Bowden's informants right now.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.831
He's not running any.
He's in Cybercrimes.

19:57.665 --> 19:58.766
Come on.

20:00.968 --> 20:02.269
Okay.

20:11.846 --> 20:12.880
Hey.

20:18.686 --> 20:19.721
What is it?

20:20.688 --> 20:21.823
Open it.

20:28.428 --> 20:29.931
It's a book.

20:29.964 --> 20:31.298
It's a little more than that.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.534
Open it.

20:36.871 --> 20:38.740
You bought
drugs from yourself.

20:38.773 --> 20:40.007
I had to beta test it.

20:40.842 --> 20:45.012
By committing a felony?
Congratulations.

20:45.046 --> 20:46.480
No. You're missing it.

20:46.514 --> 20:49.817
Look, I am using the Internet

20:49.851 --> 20:51.953
as an instrument of liberty.

20:51.986 --> 20:53.755
But that's illegal, Ross.

20:53.788 --> 20:56.624
But the war on drugs is a farce.
This is America.

20:56.657 --> 21:01.529
If you wanna smoke a bowl, snort a line,
pop a pill, that is your prerogative.

21:01.562 --> 21:06.000
And now, thanks to Underground
Brokers, you can.

21:06.734 --> 21:08.335
Underground Brokers?

21:08.368 --> 21:09.637
That's the name of the site.

21:11.072 --> 21:13.541
Okay, aside from it
being a terrible name,

21:13.574 --> 21:16.376
are you sure
you wanna go through with this?

21:17.377 --> 21:18.478
You don't like the name?

21:19.346 --> 21:22.349
That's all you heard?
That's all you're taking away?

21:22.382 --> 21:24.417
You are
so loving yourself, don't you?

21:28.355 --> 21:31.759
<i>Buyers' guide.
If you are reading this now,</i>

21:31.793 --> 21:34.962
<i>you have at least figured out how
to access a Tor hidden service.</i>

21:35.997 --> 21:37.732
<i>Good job. Smiley face.</i>

21:38.900 --> 21:42.703
<i>The currency used to buy and sell
stuff on this site is Bitcoin.</i>

21:42.737 --> 21:47.008
<i>No personal information is
associated with your Bitcoins at all,</i>

21:47.041 --> 21:49.610
<i>making them ideal

21:50.511 --> 21:52.613
<i>The first step
to placing an order</i>

21:52.647 --> 21:54.582
<i>is selecting the items
you wanna purchase</i>

21:54.615 --> 21:56.083
<i>by adding them
to your shopping cart.</i>

21:57.285 --> 22:00.822
<i>Now you can just kick back
and wait for it to arrive.</i>

22:02.590 --> 22:05.660
<i>Receiving packages.
Use a different address</i>

22:05.693 --> 22:07.662
<i>than the one where your items
will be kept,</i>

22:07.695 --> 22:10.631
<i>such as a friend's house,
or a PO box.</i>

22:11.265 --> 22:14.802
<i>Final note.

22:31.519 --> 22:33.087
Cocksucker.

22:33.888 --> 22:36.791
- Yes, Rick.
- Dude, look at this, man.

22:36.824 --> 22:38.559
I think it has
a fucking virus or something.

22:38.593 --> 22:40.460
I swear to God, every time
I try to hit,

22:40.493 --> 22:41.929
well, it says, it just...

22:41.963 --> 22:44.431
What is "undeliverable message"?
What is that?

22:44.464 --> 22:48.102
Well, Rick, okay,
I know you're having a hard time adapting.

22:48.135 --> 22:49.737
Okay, and I get it's weird,
it's weird, dude,

22:49.770 --> 22:51.572
having a 26-year-old boss.

22:51.606 --> 22:53.674
Frankly,
it's pretty odd for me, too.

22:53.708 --> 22:56.711
But you can't call me in here
every day for tech support.

22:56.744 --> 22:58.880
I'm running
17 active investigations.

22:58.913 --> 23:00.781
I simply don't have the time.
All right?

23:00.815 --> 23:02.116
Yeah, well, I apologize.

23:03.584 --> 23:05.753
Just trying to,
you know, find my place.

23:05.786 --> 23:07.822
All right, Rick,
I'm just gonna be straight with you,

23:07.855 --> 23:10.892
because that's what
Johnny Morales suggested.

23:10.925 --> 23:13.493
You don't have to do squat.

23:13.527 --> 23:18.966
Like, you can just kind of sit
back, watch old Orioles games or,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.002
I don't know,
whatever it is you're into.

23:21.035 --> 23:24.639
And in nine months,
you can retire with full pension.

23:24.672 --> 23:27.508
So, that's it, huh? Just...

23:27.541 --> 23:30.778
Rick, okay, I've got an ace
team of 20-somethings out there,

23:30.811 --> 23:33.080
fresh out of MIT, Cal Tech.

23:33.114 --> 23:35.783
They're making financial cases
that, frankly,

23:35.816 --> 23:37.018
you wouldn't
even understand, okay?

23:37.852 --> 23:39.486
But you know what?

23:39.520 --> 23:41.789
You don't have to, okay?
So just relax, it...

23:41.822 --> 23:45.760
I was locking up bad guys since before
you started shaving your fucking nuts.

23:46.827 --> 23:48.629
Now, I maybe old and slow...

23:49.630 --> 23:51.098
but I ain't stupid.

23:56.771 --> 23:58.706
I'm glad
we understand each other.

24:24.832 --> 24:26.100
Yo, Rayford,

24:26.133 --> 24:27.635
come on, man,
get in the car.

24:28.803 --> 24:31.872
Come on, shit, dude, don't be like that.
I thought we were friends.

24:31.906 --> 24:34.474
Oh, now we friends?
Fuck you, Bowden.

24:35.475 --> 24:38.612
Come on, Rayford,
get in the fucking car, dude. Huh?

24:41.615 --> 24:43.050
I ain't gonna fucking bite.

24:44.018 --> 24:45.252
There you go.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.996
I'm out the game, yo,
I don't sling no more.

24:56.731 --> 24:58.065
What's in the box?
Show me.

24:58.099 --> 24:59.200
It's just sneakers, yo.

24:59.233 --> 25:00.735
Open the fucking box, dude.

25:01.302 --> 25:02.770
Sneakers. You see?

25:02.803 --> 25:04.739
Hey. Tut-tut-tut-tut.

25:04.772 --> 25:06.507
No, don't touch that.
Come on, yo.

25:09.944 --> 25:10.978
No shit, huh?

25:12.246 --> 25:13.280
That's what you do.

25:13.314 --> 25:14.815
Yeah, sneakers, thank you.

25:16.684 --> 25:18.219
I need a solid, dude.

25:18.252 --> 25:19.987
- Solid? No.
- Yeah.

25:20.021 --> 25:21.288
I'm not doing
no more Rick Bowden solids, yo.

25:21.322 --> 25:22.656
- No?
- No.

25:25.326 --> 25:28.029
See, I'm remembering a night
at 1:00 a.m. in the morning

25:28.062 --> 25:32.166
when I got a call that you'd been
picked up by the Baltimore PD.

25:32.199 --> 25:34.235
And I got out of bed,
drove down,

25:35.002 --> 25:36.670
got there by 2:00

25:36.704 --> 25:38.105
and saved
your little Black ass

25:38.139 --> 25:39.707
from getting violated.

25:39.740 --> 25:41.042
Yo, what's the solid, yo?
What you need?

25:41.075 --> 25:42.610
Oh, gonna need
a little bit more

25:42.643 --> 25:44.178
of manners than that, dude.

25:44.211 --> 25:45.579
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

25:46.781 --> 25:48.682
What do you need, yo?

25:48.716 --> 25:50.084
You might not know it,

25:50.885 --> 25:55.256
but dudes are buying and selling
narcotics on the computers.

25:55.289 --> 25:58.692
There was a reshuffle at work and I got
promoted and put into cybercrimes, so...

25:59.493 --> 26:02.897
I need someone to show me
how to buy dope on YouTube.

26:02.930 --> 26:03.998
Can you do that?

26:04.799 --> 26:06.033
Buy dope where?

26:06.067 --> 26:08.002
On YouTube.

26:08.769 --> 26:11.105
What, did I say it wrong?

26:11.138 --> 26:12.907
Fucking tube,
whatever the fuck tube it is,

26:12.940 --> 26:14.341
I need to buy it off it.

26:14.375 --> 26:18.045
Oh, shit. Yo, you have
no fucking idea, yo.

26:18.079 --> 26:19.213
Well, that's...

26:20.681 --> 26:22.983
Oh, shit.
You gonna buy dope on YouTube.

26:23.017 --> 26:24.919
Yeah, let's get, uh,
some meth on Google.

26:24.952 --> 26:27.088
Just back the fuck up, dude.

26:27.121 --> 26:29.256
- You wanna get some fucking...
- Do you know what an informant is?

26:29.290 --> 26:32.059
For sure. I'ma inform you that
you don't buy dope on YouTube.

26:32.093 --> 26:33.928
I'm gonna inform you
that I'm gonna

26:33.961 --> 26:35.696
- fucking shoot your fucking sneakers.
- Whoa, whoa!

26:40.768 --> 26:43.904
Whoa, holy shit, man.
What the fuck?

26:44.506 --> 26:47.074
This is some kind of, like,
ghetto Batcave, huh?

26:47.108 --> 26:51.045
Yeah. Told you.
This sneaker-head shit is a moneymaker.

26:51.078 --> 26:53.114
- Yeah?
- You got a computer and a connection,

26:53.147 --> 26:54.915
- you can sell anything.
- Really?

26:54.949 --> 26:57.051
Don't touch
any of my shit, though.

26:57.084 --> 26:58.652
All right, man. Christ.

26:58.686 --> 27:00.788
All right, check this out.

27:07.962 --> 27:11.665
eBay for dope fiends.
They even got reviews and shit.

27:12.466 --> 27:13.868
Oh, shit.

27:15.269 --> 27:18.005
So what do you do? You just...

27:18.038 --> 27:20.741
You buy it on here
and then what?

27:20.774 --> 27:22.076
What do you mean,
"and then what?"

27:22.577 --> 27:25.112
What, it just arrives
at your fucking door?

27:25.146 --> 27:28.382
Yeah, yo. People been fucking with
the Dark Web for a minute now.

27:28.415 --> 27:30.217
Light shit,
you know what I'm saying?

27:30.251 --> 27:32.720
Niggas was using PayPal,
Western Union, dumb shit.

27:32.753 --> 27:34.221
But you cyber pigs
was on to that.

27:34.255 --> 27:37.291
The genius of this,
they using Bitcoin.

27:37.324 --> 27:38.893
Fucking genius shit.

27:41.028 --> 27:42.062
What's Bitcoin?

27:42.631 --> 27:44.131
It's crypto currency, yo.

27:44.165 --> 27:45.900
- Okay.
- It's the future of money.

27:45.933 --> 27:47.334
I'm sayin', a few niggas
know about it now,

27:47.368 --> 27:49.203
but once people get hip
to this shit,

27:49.236 --> 27:51.105
it's gonna be in every suburb
in America.

27:53.073 --> 27:54.942
The fuck do you know
all this shit, man?

27:55.209 --> 27:56.844
Baltimore Public Library.

27:57.478 --> 27:59.847
Fuck.

27:59.880 --> 28:02.116
Fuck is so funny, yo?
You wanna buy some drugs or not?

28:02.149 --> 28:03.484
I do wanna buy some drugs,
so...

28:03.518 --> 28:05.452
Don't touch my shit, all right?

28:05.486 --> 28:06.854
Don't touch my shit.

28:06.887 --> 28:09.023
Come on, dude,
lighten up, so...

28:09.056 --> 28:10.891
Uh-huh.
What you want?

28:10.925 --> 28:12.493
I don't know.
I think we should start with...

28:12.527 --> 28:15.362
Anything you want.
You want some mushrooms?

28:15.829 --> 28:18.299
You look like
someone who does mushrooms.

28:26.106 --> 28:28.876
You know, you are a walking
cliché, Bow-den.

28:28.909 --> 28:31.178
White man buying dope
from a nigga in the hood.

28:31.680 --> 28:33.881
Yeah, well,
that's Bowden, motherfucker.

28:33.914 --> 28:35.849
Bowden, Bow-den,
same shit, man.

28:35.883 --> 28:37.151
- Bowden.
- All right.

28:37.718 --> 28:39.453
Yo, let me ask you a question.

28:39.486 --> 28:41.956
- Shoot.
- Who out there slinging right now?

28:43.257 --> 28:45.092
Some jumpy-ass
rabbit motherfucker

28:45.125 --> 28:47.361
with the cornrows
and the buck teeth there.

28:47.394 --> 28:50.731
- Look at him.
- Yeah. You racist as shit.

28:51.298 --> 28:53.067
Yeah, but am I fucking wrong?

28:53.100 --> 28:54.969
Nah, today you right as rain.

28:55.002 --> 28:58.973
But tomorrow,
look over there, see that?

28:59.006 --> 29:00.174
See that nigga right there?

29:01.543 --> 29:03.877
- Hmm.
- Game is changing, feel me?

29:04.812 --> 29:05.879
Do you have my shit?

29:06.847 --> 29:07.948
Yeah.

29:10.184 --> 29:11.986
- Bam.
- No shit.

29:12.019 --> 29:13.487
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

29:15.422 --> 29:16.991
Welcome to the future, baby.

29:19.860 --> 29:20.995
Let me see your phone.

29:22.463 --> 29:23.931
- Your phone.
- Fuck you want with my phone?

29:23.964 --> 29:25.099
Let me see your phone.

29:25.933 --> 29:26.967
There, have at it.

29:28.536 --> 29:30.938
All right. Let me see your ID.

29:31.606 --> 29:34.509
- Why?
- Let me see your ID. Shit.

29:36.977 --> 29:38.212
Old-ass wallet.

29:38.245 --> 29:39.880
What are you doing?

29:39.913 --> 29:41.482
Can you just relax for a second?

29:43.417 --> 29:44.552
All right.

29:45.319 --> 29:49.056
Congratulations, you now own
a Bitcoin wallet.

29:49.089 --> 29:52.192
Next time you want some dope,
have Uncle Sam send it, all right?

29:52.860 --> 29:55.530
Now that's your solid,
don't call me no fucking more.

29:56.363 --> 29:58.332
Get your own fucking...

30:15.249 --> 30:17.519
No, I mean, we're talking
about a multi-jurisdiction.

30:18.352 --> 30:20.522
- The situation that, um...
- Shields, you need to see this.

30:20.555 --> 30:22.022
- But what I'm saying is that, if...
- Boss.

30:22.056 --> 30:23.223
Hold on, one moment.

30:23.257 --> 30:26.293
No, not now, Rick, stop.
Go on.

30:26.327 --> 30:30.230
Yeah, right, in a normal situation
there's, uh, you know,

30:30.264 --> 30:33.500
for every man in the forces,
there's a manager.

30:33.535 --> 30:36.203
So what I'm saying here is that
we take the...

30:36.236 --> 30:38.506
I mean, we could, yeah,
but, it...

30:39.173 --> 30:43.444
<i>I've decided to keep a journal
about my experience running the site.</i>

30:43.477 --> 30:47.047
<i>I imagine that someday I may have
a story written about my life</i>

30:47.081 --> 30:50.017
<i>and it would be a good idea to
keep a detailed account of it.</i>

30:50.918 --> 30:53.987
<i>I'm creating
a year of prosperity and power</i>

30:54.021 --> 30:56.890
<i>beyond what I have
ever experienced before.</i>

30:58.325 --> 31:01.462
<i>Silk Road
is going to become a phenomenon.</i>

31:01.495 --> 31:03.631
<i>And at least one person
will tell me about it</i>

31:03.665 --> 31:06.033
<i>unknowing
that I was its creator.</i>

31:13.140 --> 31:17.478
Oh, shit.
These beers fair game? Ross?

31:18.045 --> 31:21.248
Earth to Ross. Hello,
Mr. Rossington. Okay.

31:21.281 --> 31:23.016
That's a yes.

31:23.484 --> 31:25.252
Yo, check this out.

31:27.121 --> 31:29.123
Great name, nice camel.

31:29.156 --> 31:30.290
Keep reading.

31:30.792 --> 31:34.596
Okay, Indicas,
Sour Diesel 13 and Grape Ape.

31:35.697 --> 31:38.132
Acid,
microdot or blotter.

31:38.165 --> 31:42.035
MDMA, ecstasy,
basically the same thing and 'shrooms.

31:42.537 --> 31:44.938
Yeah, dude,
you're, uh, so getting busted.

31:44.972 --> 31:47.642
Nope.
Bitcoin plus Tor. Untraceable.

31:47.675 --> 31:49.977
You're insane.
Can you please tell him he's insane?

31:50.010 --> 31:51.345
You're insane.

31:51.378 --> 31:53.347
Also, uh,
just a thought, friend.

31:53.815 --> 31:57.519
How's anyone supposed to find this?
You can't advertise it, Ross.

31:57.552 --> 32:00.120
I've been posing as a user
and touting it on the forums.

32:01.623 --> 32:03.056
The forums?

32:03.090 --> 32:05.025
What? The chat rooms...

32:05.058 --> 32:07.194
You're too good for chat rooms,
too good for forums?

32:07.227 --> 32:09.664
No, man, chat rooms are,
uh, cute, they're nice.

32:09.697 --> 32:14.234
But you're gonna want more exposure
than, you know, some 4chan fuck-heads.

32:14.702 --> 32:16.638
Oh, you should call
my friend over at Gawker.

32:17.237 --> 32:19.072
You have a friend at Gawker?

32:19.106 --> 32:21.609
Yeah, I met him
at South By last year.

32:21.643 --> 32:23.010
Don't ask.

32:23.043 --> 32:24.612
Lot of questions there, but...

32:24.646 --> 32:26.146
Okay, well,
he's not just gonna

32:26.180 --> 32:27.749
pick up an anonymous call

32:27.782 --> 32:30.484
at like, what,
10 o'clock at night?

32:30.518 --> 32:34.087
Uh, that's exactly what he's gonna
do, he's a reporter. It's a story.

32:34.789 --> 32:38.225
Don't do it.
Ross, I'm begging you, don't do it.

32:39.193 --> 32:40.327
Ross, don't do it.

32:40.360 --> 32:42.564
Yeah. Give me his number.

32:42.597 --> 32:44.331
- No.
- Yeah.

32:46.166 --> 32:47.401
*67.

32:47.434 --> 32:48.570
- Of course.
- This is fucking dumb.

32:48.603 --> 32:50.170
I wasn't born yesterday.

32:50.204 --> 32:52.105
You're literally
going straight to...

32:52.139 --> 32:53.541
It's your idea, bro.

33:01.683 --> 33:03.317
Gawker.

33:03.350 --> 33:05.520
- <i>Adrian? Uh...</i>
- Who's this?

33:06.153 --> 33:10.290
- <i>You don't know me, but I have your next story.</i>
- Thirty seconds.

33:10.324 --> 33:14.261
Making small talk with your pot dealer
sucks. Buying cocaine can get you shot.

33:14.294 --> 33:17.231
But what if you could buy drugs
online like socks or light bulbs?

33:17.264 --> 33:20.367
<i>Now you can with an online
website called Silk Road.</i>

33:20.400 --> 33:22.169
<i>Did you coach him on this?</i>

33:22.202 --> 33:23.538
Who am I talking with?

33:23.972 --> 33:26.273
<i>Call me Mark.</i>

33:26.306 --> 33:29.042
<i>No last name, but you can quote me.</i>

33:29.076 --> 33:32.780
- And you created it?
- <i>No, but I ordered ten hits of acid</i>

33:32.814 --> 33:36.518
<i>delivered to my doorstep
by the US Postal Service.</i>

33:36.551 --> 33:38.318
And what did that feel like?

33:38.352 --> 33:40.788
Well, to tell you the truth,
Adrian...

33:42.422 --> 33:44.592
it kind of felt like the future.

33:47.529 --> 33:51.365
Last question.
Anything you can't get on Silk Road?

33:51.699 --> 33:53.367
<i>Nothing to harm or defraud.</i>

33:53.400 --> 33:57.104
Like kiddie porn
or stolen credit cards.

33:57.137 --> 33:59.139
<i>So no weapons-grade plutonium?</i>

33:59.172 --> 34:00.374
Or murder for hire.

34:00.942 --> 34:02.577
<i>Is there anything
you'd like to add?</i>

34:04.444 --> 34:05.479
Yes.

34:07.381 --> 34:09.583
Stop funding the state
with your tax dollars

34:09.617 --> 34:13.253
and direct your productive
energies towards the black markets.

34:14.388 --> 34:16.156
- Fuck you.
- Whoo!

34:16.757 --> 34:19.259
- Holy shit.
- That felt good, man.

34:19.293 --> 34:21.395
- You know what that felt like?
- No.

34:21.428 --> 34:23.330
The future. You know.

34:23.362 --> 34:25.299
I just felt it right in my
bones, right there, the future.

34:25.331 --> 34:27.167
Go fuck yourself.
Don't be jealous.

34:27.199 --> 34:28.570
It's right there,
it's right ahead of us.

34:37.143 --> 34:42.248
Oh, hey, peanut! What are you doing here?
Huh? What are you doing here?

34:42.282 --> 34:43.818
Hey.
We were in the neighborhood.

34:43.851 --> 34:45.351
Thought we could stop by
and say hey.

34:45.385 --> 34:47.722
- Is that right? This for me?
- Mm-hmm.

34:47.755 --> 34:49.724
Figured you could
use the company.

34:49.757 --> 34:51.793
Yeah, another Cobb salad
with those dipshits,

34:51.826 --> 34:54.127
- I swear to God I'll eat a bullet.
- Language, Daddy.

34:54.161 --> 34:56.228
Oh, "language, Daddy."
Is that right?

34:56.263 --> 34:57.765
Nineteen years
you've been on this job,

34:57.799 --> 34:59.333
this is the first time
I've been in your office.

34:59.366 --> 35:00.702
Yeah, the last one

35:00.735 --> 35:02.269
wasn't exactly
a daycare, was it?

35:02.302 --> 35:04.371
Neither was Max's Taphouse.

35:05.873 --> 35:07.875
Tell you what,
why don't we get outta here, huh?

35:07.909 --> 35:09.611
- Why don't we go somewhere special?
- Get some ice cream.

35:09.644 --> 35:13.213
Ice cream for lunch?
No, no, no, no, no.

35:13.246 --> 35:14.816
She's gonna have ice cream for
lunch, come on, let's go.

35:14.849 --> 35:16.383
I'm having ice cream
for lunch?

35:16.416 --> 35:17.518
Yeah, you are,
only if you behave.

35:17.552 --> 35:18.686
Yeah, we'll see about that.

35:18.720 --> 35:20.354
You watch that mouth, girl.

35:20.387 --> 35:21.556
Come on, let's go.

35:21.990 --> 35:25.325
Look at that.
What do you think? Huh?

35:25.359 --> 35:28.261
Edie, look, they got nurse sharks.
Go check 'em out.

35:28.763 --> 35:30.364
Oh, my God. Go on, honey.

35:31.198 --> 35:32.700
I think they're sleeping.

35:34.535 --> 35:35.637
You checking up on me?

35:36.169 --> 35:39.641
Yeah, I am.
You okay with that?

35:40.742 --> 35:44.344
Oh, my gosh.
Babe, look. Check it out.

35:44.378 --> 35:45.947
Did you go to the school?

35:45.980 --> 35:49.784
I did. Forest Hills,
babe, it's amazing.

35:50.685 --> 35:52.520
Classes are all small,

35:52.553 --> 35:54.287
and the teachers
all specialize

35:54.321 --> 35:55.923
in overcoming
learning challenges.

35:55.957 --> 35:59.259
- Okay.
- It's... it's great.

35:59.292 --> 36:01.562
Hey, baby, honey,
don't tap on the glass.

36:01.596 --> 36:04.364
She saw a little boy
her age who had built a robot.

36:04.398 --> 36:06.534
A walking, talking robot.
It was...

36:06.567 --> 36:07.602
How much?

36:08.870 --> 36:10.370
Did they say?
Did you talk about it?

36:10.404 --> 36:11.606
- Yeah.
- How much?

36:12.372 --> 36:13.407
Forty.

36:14.274 --> 36:15.375
Fuck.

36:16.476 --> 36:20.213
I told them you were in law
enforcement and that I am a nurse,

36:20.247 --> 36:22.717
and they have scholarships
and she's eligible for those.

36:22.750 --> 36:24.484
So we're gonna go for it.

36:24.519 --> 36:26.453
- They said that?
- Yeah.

36:26.486 --> 36:27.755
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:28.823 --> 36:31.592
Hey, come on, look at her.
Look at that little...

36:32.225 --> 36:34.796
I mean, how do they not give
her a full scholarship, huh?

36:34.829 --> 36:36.597
Mm.

36:36.631 --> 36:38.231
- Huh?
- Yeah.

36:38.265 --> 36:40.200
And you think
this is the way to go, huh?

36:40.768 --> 36:41.836
This is good for her.

36:43.705 --> 36:45.606
I need you
to get on board, okay?

36:48.876 --> 36:50.243
You with us?

36:51.779 --> 36:53.881
When am I not with you, huh?

36:55.382 --> 36:56.416
Hmm?

37:06.493 --> 37:09.797
It'll never go in. Yeah!

37:09.831 --> 37:11.999
You suck.
Doesn't he suck? He sucks.

37:12.033 --> 37:13.433
No, you're jealous.

37:13.467 --> 37:14.569
Constantly.

37:15.770 --> 37:17.505
Well, your phone is blowing up.

37:17.538 --> 37:19.507
Are you sure you don't
want to check you phone?

37:19.540 --> 37:21.008
- Don't you want to check your phone?
- Don't sabotage.

37:21.042 --> 37:22.577
- I know you do.
- Don't sabotage.

37:22.610 --> 37:23.878
Wait, now, seriously, dude,

37:23.911 --> 37:26.346
you have like
50 unread messages.

37:29.016 --> 37:30.417
What the hell?

37:31.586 --> 37:32.754
This says a 101.

37:32.787 --> 37:34.756
You get hacked or something?

37:36.423 --> 37:38.258
Three hundred
and thirteen new messages.

37:39.326 --> 37:41.529
- From who?
- I don't know. I...

37:42.163 --> 37:44.464
I had everything from Silk Road
forwarded to my Gmail.

37:44.498 --> 37:45.633
Holy shit.

37:46.701 --> 37:50.337
The Gawker article posted.
He wrote what you said, word for word.

37:51.706 --> 37:53.941
Holy shit.

37:55.009 --> 37:56.844
1,154.

37:56.878 --> 37:58.846
That's gonna
crash your site, man.

38:01.749 --> 38:03.017
Shit, you're right.

38:04.484 --> 38:06.988
Okay, we gotta go.
Finish your beer.

38:07.021 --> 38:09.090
No, actually, fuck your beer.
We gotta go.

38:09.123 --> 38:10.958
- No, we got a full fucking pitcher, Ross.
- No, we got to go.

38:10.992 --> 38:13.360
- We can't just...
- Hold on, I got this.

38:13.393 --> 38:17.965
Grab your shit. Just leave...
leave the chip. Come on.

38:22.603 --> 38:24.404
Bounced the local hosting?

38:24.437 --> 38:26.941
Outsourced it
to a data center in Iceland.

38:27.975 --> 38:29.510
Get fucked, NSA.

38:30.611 --> 38:31.746
NSA?

38:32.914 --> 38:36.517
I just made 75 grand in Bitcoin
in the last 90 minutes, babe.

38:37.350 --> 38:39.554
Sooner or later
someone's gonna come knocking.

38:43.524 --> 38:47.562
But now,
they can't trace my IP address.

38:47.595 --> 38:51.999
Ross,
that's $833 a minute.

38:53.768 --> 38:55.002
Go the other way.

38:58.072 --> 39:02.577
Holy shit,
1.2 million a day.

39:10.751 --> 39:13.020
Fuck you.

39:17.725 --> 39:21.863
<i>Neighbors, there is something
interesting going on right now.</i>

39:21.896 --> 39:25.666
<i>What if I were to tell you
that there is a drug super store</i>

39:25.700 --> 39:27.001
<i>on the Internet right now?</i>

39:28.636 --> 39:31.672
<i>To all the new faces, welcome.</i>

39:32.173 --> 39:35.142
<i>Our basic rules are to treat
others as you wish to be treated,</i>

39:35.176 --> 39:39.479
<i>and don't do anything
to hurt or scam anyone else.</i>

39:39.513 --> 39:40.781
<i>Something special
came in the mail.</i>

39:42.583 --> 39:46.419
It looks and feels
exactly like eBay, Amazon,

39:46.453 --> 39:49.557
whatever other online purchasing
site you're familiar with.

39:50.992 --> 39:54.629
<i>Silk Road is already making
an impact on the war on drugs</i>

39:54.662 --> 39:58.833
<i>by expanding people's access
to controlled substances.</i>

40:00.601 --> 40:03.037
<i>Every transaction
that takes place</i>

40:03.070 --> 40:06.140
<i>outside the nexus of state
control is a victory.</i>

40:06.173 --> 40:09.877
<i>So there are literally hundreds
of victories here each week,</i>

40:09.911 --> 40:12.847
<i>and each one weakens the state.</i>

40:12.880 --> 40:16.918
<i>To learn more about libertarianism,
philosophy or just to make friends,</i>

40:16.951 --> 40:18.786
<i>check out the forums.</i>

40:18.819 --> 40:21.088
<i>Oh, and please,
contribute to the community</i>

40:21.122 --> 40:24.659
<i>by reviewing your sellers,
buyers and products.</i>

40:24.692 --> 40:26.961
<i>And you're not
paranoid about using the mail?</i>

40:26.994 --> 40:31.098
No. They, like, vacuum seal it
so the dogs can't even smell it.

40:31.132 --> 40:33.901
Like, seriously,
they've thought of everything.

40:33.935 --> 40:36.771
- Whoa.
- Yeah. Game changer.

40:36.804 --> 40:40.975
- Who runs it?
- I don't know, but the guy's pretty genius.

40:44.912 --> 40:46.047
Genius.

40:46.080 --> 40:48.015
Don't get ahead of yourself.

40:50.084 --> 40:51.185
Their words.

40:54.855 --> 40:56.691
Anybody else
from your outfit coming today?

40:56.724 --> 40:58.559
Nope, they save
all the good stuff for me.

40:59.593 --> 41:05.533
Okay. US Postal Service interdicts
narcotics by two primary means.

41:05.566 --> 41:09.103
One is drug dogs, effective for large
shipments of controlled substances,

41:09.136 --> 41:10.972
typically a kilo or more.

41:11.005 --> 41:13.541
The other is random X-rays.

41:13.574 --> 41:15.176
This is your
ounce or less crew.

41:15.209 --> 41:17.111
This latter category,

41:17.144 --> 41:19.647
we've noticed a 300% increase
in the past three months.

41:19.680 --> 41:22.717
Lot of little stuff adds
up to the big stuff, right?

41:22.750 --> 41:25.720
- Theoretically.
- So what do you think's driving the spike?

41:25.753 --> 41:27.088
I don't know,
it's all small-time,

41:27.121 --> 41:28.556
so they haven't given us
the resources

41:28.589 --> 41:29.991
to figure it out yet.

41:30.024 --> 41:31.726
Well, do they have
anything in common?

41:32.293 --> 41:33.894
Actually, yes.

41:34.962 --> 41:37.298
Everything they've seized out
of Utah has that stamped on it.

41:37.331 --> 41:38.566
No shit.

42:27.048 --> 42:29.183
Yo, Rayford, man, come on.
It's Bowden. Open the fuck up.

42:29.216 --> 42:30.251
Motherfucker.

42:33.754 --> 42:35.656
Oh, fuck.

42:38.325 --> 42:39.994
Fuck that nigga right there.

42:44.732 --> 42:46.033
Fuck.

42:46.067 --> 42:47.968
You open
this motherfucking door,

42:48.002 --> 42:50.104
you motherfucking piece of fuck!

42:53.374 --> 42:55.876
Fucking game, dude, huh?
You think this is fucking funny?

42:55.910 --> 42:58.245
Come on,
why don't you ease it?

42:58.279 --> 43:01.382
Goddamn! Fuck, dude,
it smells dank in here.

43:01.415 --> 43:03.784
You know, I'm gonna have you
note that that came anonymous...

43:03.818 --> 43:05.953
Oh, what, you cooking up a
chicken with this oregano? Hmm.

43:05.986 --> 43:08.956
No, that's from a customer.
I didn't pay for that. That's...

43:08.989 --> 43:12.226
Yeah, I don't give a fuck
about your fucking chicken.

43:14.395 --> 43:17.598
What else can you tell me about
this cat that sold you the 'shrooms?

43:18.132 --> 43:20.835
Uh, goes by the name
of Chronic Pain.

43:20.868 --> 43:22.036
Yeah, and what else?
Come on.

43:22.703 --> 43:24.872
- That's it.
- Come on, dude, help me out.

43:24.905 --> 43:27.875
I got an envelope postmarked Utah.
I got no return address.

43:27.908 --> 43:29.376
Utah's a big-ass state.

43:30.044 --> 43:33.080
What else can you tell me about him?
Something? Chronic Pain?

43:33.114 --> 43:36.050
Well, hold on.
What makes you think it's a him?

43:36.083 --> 43:40.654
You ever seen this movie called
<i>Cocaine Cowboys?</i> It was a documentary.

43:40.688 --> 43:44.058
And the baddest motherfucker in that
was a bitch named the Black Widow.

43:44.492 --> 43:46.894
She was drilling holes
in motherfuckers...

43:46.927 --> 43:49.263
What the fuck has this got to do
with what I'm asking you about?

43:49.296 --> 43:52.199
I'm just saying. A nigga can be
whoever they want on the Internet.

43:54.335 --> 43:56.003
Whoever they want.

44:05.179 --> 44:07.448
You know what people do with cats?

44:07.481 --> 44:09.950
They just let them
live in their fucking house.

44:09.984 --> 44:12.786
They don't even
actually interact, like, ever.

44:13.320 --> 44:17.091
They're like, "Oh, look at all my cats.
I keep them alive."

44:17.825 --> 44:20.861
You and I, we, like,
actually hang out.

44:22.429 --> 44:28.435
Imagine a baby,
but it's tall, it's cute.

44:29.504 --> 44:33.340
But it's intimidating,
it is the size of a basketball hoop

44:33.374 --> 44:36.243
and it's asking for its pacifier.

44:38.179 --> 44:40.147
And it could crush you,

44:40.181 --> 44:42.249
but it's asking
for a cracker or something.

44:44.218 --> 44:46.787
You're the man now, dawg.

44:47.254 --> 44:53.227
What was the movie where
James Bond was the guy with the blind kid?

44:53.260 --> 44:54.862
That was a good movie.

45:08.108 --> 45:09.877
Why don't you come to bed?

45:09.910 --> 45:11.011
Listen to this.

45:12.947 --> 45:15.282
"Fish scale Colombian cocaine."

45:15.749 --> 45:20.454
"Has a nice sheen and provides a rush
of euphoria and confidence."

45:21.822 --> 45:22.890
Now this one.

45:23.658 --> 45:28.996
"Crystal MDMA.
Has a lovely fizz and a wisp of smoke."

45:30.931 --> 45:32.166
You've got issues.

45:32.701 --> 45:34.134
I think I just solved them.

45:35.469 --> 45:37.838
This guy is a one-man fan club.

45:38.439 --> 45:41.141
That's not what I meant.
You're getting obsessive.

45:41.175 --> 45:42.943
I think you mean obsessed.

45:42.977 --> 45:44.011
You know what I meant.

45:46.080 --> 45:47.214
I'll be in bed.

45:53.487 --> 45:57.458
Oh, that's not where we're
going with our teeth, baby.

45:57.891 --> 46:01.061
We're not going down there, going up here.

46:02.830 --> 46:04.231
Oh, hold up.

46:04.265 --> 46:06.200
"Your work
has not gone unnoticed.

46:06.233 --> 46:07.868
Wanna offer you a job."

46:07.901 --> 46:09.103
What?

46:10.871 --> 46:13.207
Uh, okay.

46:15.242 --> 46:17.278
What do I have to do?

46:17.311 --> 46:19.446
What? You gotta get up.

46:19.480 --> 46:22.249
This is getting interesting.
You're gonna miss this, come here.

46:22.883 --> 46:25.319
"Review products.
Manage orders. Get rich."

46:25.352 --> 46:26.920
"Get rich"?

46:27.888 --> 46:29.890
I'm in, brother.

46:32.092 --> 46:35.429
"Send scan of your ID"?

46:35.462 --> 46:37.898
Yeah, what do you think of that?
What should we tell him?

46:37.931 --> 46:41.068
To kiss our dimply ass?

46:42.102 --> 46:47.007
"Why do you need my ID
when I don't know who you are?"

46:49.511 --> 46:51.546
Nice try, jokester.

46:54.081 --> 46:58.419
Oh! Underboss, bitches!

46:58.886 --> 47:01.121
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

47:01.155 --> 47:07.094
Yes.
I'm just gonna roll the die

47:07.127 --> 47:08.996
and hope I don't die.

47:11.198 --> 47:14.468
You support this, right?
You wanna be an underboss, right?

47:14.501 --> 47:18.272
You don't wanna be a fucking
ferret your whole life.

47:26.180 --> 47:29.983
I need a name. I need a name.
I need a name.

47:32.286 --> 47:34.522
"Then David came to Nob..."

47:37.291 --> 47:39.126
Nob it is for me.

47:40.494 --> 47:41.962
Daddy?

47:43.464 --> 47:45.667
Oh, hey, peanut,
what are you doing up? Huh?

47:45.700 --> 47:48.135
Where's Mom?

47:49.002 --> 47:50.538
Asleep on the couch.

47:50.572 --> 47:52.640
Oh.
She must be fucking drunk.

47:53.974 --> 47:55.042
You wanna help me?

47:55.744 --> 47:57.612
Take a picture of me?
Do that?

48:00.515 --> 48:02.383
Right there we go, just...

48:03.117 --> 48:05.185
Up here, honey.
Up here, yeah?

48:05.986 --> 48:07.087
Smile, Dada.

48:07.121 --> 48:09.056
No, no smile, I'm a bad guy.

48:09.089 --> 48:10.958
Just pretending to be a bad
guy, but I'm a bad guy.

48:11.458 --> 48:13.528
Bad guys
wear their hoodies up.

48:14.194 --> 48:19.199
You got a point. All right.
Well spotted, honey. How's that?

48:22.136 --> 48:25.305
- Got it.
- Got it, yes, you did. Bingo.

48:25.774 --> 48:28.208
Off you go, okay?
Thanks for helping.

48:28.242 --> 48:30.344
Little things, Dada,
make you believe.

48:30.377 --> 48:33.648
Little things. Yeah, well,
one more little thing, okay? Honey?

48:34.516 --> 48:36.684
This is between you and me, okay?
Don't tell Mom.

48:43.457 --> 48:44.592
Up you go.

48:47.027 --> 48:48.962
Fuck. Okay.

49:08.382 --> 49:10.083
- <i>Yo.</i>
- Yeah, dude, it's me.

49:10.117 --> 49:12.019
<i>Stop calling me
all the time, man.</i>

49:12.052 --> 49:13.588
How do I get the picture
from the camera

49:13.621 --> 49:15.355
to the fucking computer, man?

49:47.589 --> 49:52.527
Oh, here we go.
We're up. Thanks.

49:54.629 --> 49:55.763
Yeah.

50:02.236 --> 50:06.139
Tonight our Call-6 investigators dig
into what's known as The Dark Net.

50:06.908 --> 50:09.744
It's been called
eBay for illegal drugs.

50:09.777 --> 50:12.246
A network
of relatively hidden websites

50:12.279 --> 50:15.315
where users can buy everything
from ecstasy to opium.

50:15.349 --> 50:18.620
<i>The Silk Road website is
a particular headache for authorities.</i>

50:18.653 --> 50:21.421
<i>The government says
hundreds of thousands of users</i>

50:21.455 --> 50:24.659
<i>use the impossible-to-trace
website which sells drugs.</i>

50:24.692 --> 50:29.129
<i>We're talking about cocaine,
LSD, ecstasy. You name it and it's here.</i>

50:29.162 --> 50:31.566
Someone that is wanting
to sell illegal drugs

50:31.599 --> 50:34.268
can use this to come in contact with
someone that wants to buy illegal drugs.

50:36.838 --> 50:38.238
What do you think?

50:39.874 --> 50:43.110
Oh, my God, Ross,
this is really serious.

50:44.044 --> 50:46.814
<i>An underground website
used to sell illegal drugs</i>

50:46.848 --> 50:49.383
<i>is the new target for New York
senator, Charles Schumer.</i>

50:49.416 --> 50:52.654
<i>He has asked federal authorities to
shut down and investigate the site.</i>

50:52.687 --> 50:55.523
<i>It's known as Silk Road.</i>

50:55.557 --> 51:01.194
<i>This website is nothing more than an
all-you-can-order buffet of contraband</i>

51:01.228 --> 51:03.531
<i>that needs to be shut down
immediately.</i>

51:05.232 --> 51:06.601
Are you scared?

51:09.637 --> 51:10.672
Yeah.

51:13.908 --> 51:15.208
Yeah.

51:16.911 --> 51:18.613
Hey, you got
a call from the FBI.

51:18.646 --> 51:20.480
Putting together
an inter-agency task force

51:20.515 --> 51:22.884
- on some online dope bazaar.
- What, Silk Road?

51:22.917 --> 51:25.152
- Yeah.
- No, we're already on it. Who's running point?

51:25.185 --> 51:27.487
A guy called Tarbell.
Sounds like a real gunner.

51:27.522 --> 51:30.725
He's just looking for a token narc
to qualify for OCDETF funding.

51:30.758 --> 51:32.259
You got somebody we can spare?

51:32.292 --> 51:34.294
No fucking way,
I got my A-Team on this.

51:34.328 --> 51:36.496
FBI'll just steal our work
claiming credit.

51:36.531 --> 51:39.366
Shields, I can't say no to an
inter-departmental request, okay?

51:39.399 --> 51:41.603
Look, personally,
I don't give a fuck who you send,

51:41.636 --> 51:43.337
long as they got a badge
and a heartbeat.

51:45.807 --> 51:46.841
Fuck.

51:48.876 --> 51:51.713
Jesus fucking Christ.

51:52.747 --> 51:55.550
Oh, Jesus.

51:55.583 --> 51:57.351
- Bowden?
- Yeah.

51:59.520 --> 52:02.189
Oh, hang on. What?

52:03.591 --> 52:05.492
Are you
familiar with Silk Road?

52:05.526 --> 52:06.694
Yeah.

52:06.728 --> 52:08.128
- Really?
- Yeah.

52:08.663 --> 52:10.230
What the fuck, it's a website.

52:10.263 --> 52:11.699
They sell dope and shit
on the net.

52:13.500 --> 52:16.236
Perfect. The FBI's putting
together a task force.

52:16.269 --> 52:18.438
There's a briefing at the
Federal Building at 1100.

52:18.472 --> 52:20.842
Report to Agent Tarbell.
You'll love him.

52:20.875 --> 52:23.377
- Okay. Hey, Shields?
- Yep?

52:23.410 --> 52:25.747
Is there any way to track
dope busts in the mail?

52:25.780 --> 52:28.248
You know, small shit,
ounce or less.

52:28.281 --> 52:30.618
Yeah, I'll have Sirkis
set up a geofence.

52:30.652 --> 52:33.554
They'll notify you whenever the local
postal interdiction police gets a pop.

52:33.988 --> 52:36.156
- Geofence? Good.
- Yeah.

52:36.691 --> 52:38.258
Why?

52:38.291 --> 52:41.261
No reason, you know,
I might have an idea

52:41.294 --> 52:43.430
to crack
this Silk Road shit wide open.

52:43.463 --> 52:45.232
- Rick?
- Yeah.

52:45.265 --> 52:47.300
I've got a next-level team
on this, okay?

52:47.334 --> 52:49.269
And I don't need some old-school
street crap buggering it up.

52:49.971 --> 52:52.439
Report to the task force,
keep your trap shut,

52:52.472 --> 52:53.841
and don't make us look stupid.

52:57.845 --> 53:01.949
As the NSA puts it,
with 2.5 million daily users,

53:01.983 --> 53:07.689
Tor's the king of high-security,
low-latency Internet anonymity.

53:07.722 --> 53:09.824
You're aware, boss,
that given the volume of users,

53:09.857 --> 53:12.827
the odds of finding a single IP
address are almost impossible?

53:12.860 --> 53:14.327
I was hoping
you'd say that, Kim.

53:19.534 --> 53:22.904
What you got there
is five grams of cupronickel.

53:23.336 --> 53:27.909
75% copper, 25% nickel.
Worth five American cents.

53:27.942 --> 53:29.577
What the hell
happened to it?

53:29.610 --> 53:31.813
I got this brother-in-law
in West Texas,

53:31.846 --> 53:33.413
married to my kid sister.

53:33.447 --> 53:35.650
Seven kids between them.

53:36.617 --> 53:39.854
Now I'm not saying for certain,
there's an extra chromosome involved,

53:39.887 --> 53:41.823
but this guy is not gonna win
any MacArthur Grants.

53:41.856 --> 53:43.558
Do you know what I'm saying?

53:43.591 --> 53:45.927
And until last Tuesday,
he might have been

53:45.960 --> 53:47.762
the unluckiest man
in America.

53:48.295 --> 53:49.897
Well, what happened Tuesday?

53:51.498 --> 53:55.937
He got hit by lightning...
for a second time.

53:55.970 --> 53:57.538
Did it kill him?

53:57.572 --> 53:58.606
No.

54:00.474 --> 54:02.543
He had that nickel
in his pocket, though.

54:03.544 --> 54:06.279
The electrical current burned
a hole in his dungarees,

54:06.313 --> 54:07.849
seared through
his testicular wall

54:07.882 --> 54:09.784
and cauterized
his vas deferens.

54:12.754 --> 54:13.988
God's own vasectomy.

54:16.524 --> 54:18.826
The odds of that happening?
One in 25 million.

54:18.860 --> 54:20.695
My point being, Kim...

54:20.728 --> 54:22.663
...nothing's impossible.

54:23.497 --> 54:26.834
Fantastic. I see the DEA sent
its best and its brightest.

54:26.868 --> 54:29.036
Uh, welcome to the task force,
Mr. Flintstone?

54:29.070 --> 54:31.506
No, Bowden, Rick Bowden, DEA.
Hey, guys.

54:31.539 --> 54:33.608
Chris Tarbell, FBI.
Have a seat, please.

54:33.641 --> 54:35.610
Sorry, I'm late, man,
I just got fucking caught up in here.

54:36.343 --> 54:38.278
Sure you did. Okay.

54:38.946 --> 54:40.648
Are we working
any human sources?

54:40.681 --> 54:41.883
- No.
- No?

54:41.916 --> 54:43.584
Sorry, what was that?

54:43.618 --> 54:46.386
Did you...
did you need something there?

54:46.419 --> 54:49.690
No. I just, uh, wondered if
we're working any human sources?

54:51.025 --> 54:52.059
Negative.

54:52.593 --> 54:54.394
Well, you mean not yet, huh?

54:54.962 --> 54:58.599
No, I mean, I'm just not really
into wasting resources, sport.

54:58.633 --> 55:02.435
We're not tailing guys here.
We're hunting IP addresses.

55:05.907 --> 55:07.440
I mean, fuck, somebody
some where's

55:07.474 --> 55:09.409
touching the keyboards, right?

55:09.442 --> 55:11.512
Wait a minute,
are you gonna crack this?

55:11.546 --> 55:13.915
You can just crack it the
old-fashioned way, Agent Bowden?

55:13.948 --> 55:15.550
Maybe.

55:15.583 --> 55:16.984
That's fantastic.
I'll tell you what,

55:17.018 --> 55:19.921
when you snatch him up,
send me a fax.

56:59.220 --> 57:00.487
Ross.

57:03.591 --> 57:05.626
Ross, we need
to have a conversation.

57:05.660 --> 57:06.794
Just one sec.

57:07.528 --> 57:08.629
Pay attention to me.

57:09.230 --> 57:12.066
- I am.
- Look, this is on the Silk Road homepage.

57:13.034 --> 57:18.906
Crack, crystal meth. You're making money
off of drug addicts and poor people.

57:18.940 --> 57:24.477
Julia, look, the average Silk
Road user is college educated,

57:24.512 --> 57:26.948
has a laptop
and has access to broadband.

57:26.981 --> 57:29.150
More than that,
there are seller reviews.

57:29.583 --> 57:33.220
Baby, buying drugs off of my site is
safer than buying 'em on the street.

57:33.254 --> 57:34.789
Give me a break, Ross.

57:34.822 --> 57:36.624
You might not
understand this.

57:36.657 --> 57:40.561
This is my community
and I care about it.

57:48.836 --> 57:49.937
Wait.

58:10.558 --> 58:11.592
Zoom right here.

58:12.593 --> 58:13.861
Third one this week.

58:14.462 --> 58:17.031
It's hardly worth the paperwork
for a little marijuana.

58:19.166 --> 58:20.735
It's about
the right amount, though.

58:31.679 --> 58:33.681
Fucking meth?
Jesus Christ.

58:44.358 --> 58:46.827
Come on,
I saw you, you fucking bitch.

59:14.989 --> 59:17.758
Hey. Where you been?

59:18.626 --> 59:19.660
Out.

59:24.632 --> 59:25.699
Hey.

59:28.135 --> 59:29.170
I'm sorry.

59:30.738 --> 59:33.741
Sorry that
I've been distant...

59:34.543 --> 59:37.812
and I've been
a little obsessed.

59:37.845 --> 59:38.913
You're right.

59:41.148 --> 59:43.284
And obsessive.
Both are correct, actually.

59:47.321 --> 59:48.823
You're such a dick.

01:00:00.668 --> 01:00:02.269
I got something else
to tell you.

01:00:04.238 --> 01:00:05.306
What?

01:00:06.874 --> 01:00:11.345
I got a new name...
for my admin.

01:00:11.378 --> 01:00:14.682
The Dread Pirate Roberts.

01:00:19.053 --> 01:00:21.856
<i>Princess Bride.</i>
You fucking kidding me?

01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:23.891
No.

01:00:24.425 --> 01:00:26.293
Julia, it's brilliant.

01:00:26.327 --> 01:00:28.195
Look, that way,
I can pass it along to somebody else.

01:00:28.229 --> 01:00:30.131
This thing is gonna
outlive all of us.

01:00:30.965 --> 01:00:34.668
This isn't a movie, Ross.
I'm gonna go to bed.

01:00:37.171 --> 01:00:40.341
<i>♪ As you wish ♪</i>

01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:51.418
Where have you been?

01:00:52.887 --> 01:00:54.288
Edie waited up.

01:00:55.055 --> 01:00:57.758
Yeah, I was at work.
I was working.

01:00:57.791 --> 01:00:59.894
What's going on here, huh?
Are you drunk?

01:01:00.361 --> 01:01:02.196
- Are you?
- Yeah. No, I'm...

01:01:02.229 --> 01:01:04.832
No,
I'm fucking working, I said. Huh?

01:01:04.865 --> 01:01:05.933
Hmm.

01:01:07.368 --> 01:01:11.238
I'm hunting, baby. I'm hunting big game.
I mean, seriously, Sandy.

01:01:11.272 --> 01:01:13.707
Like kingpin shit.

01:01:13.741 --> 01:01:16.877
Yeah, I mean, this guy's gotta be...
You know, he's got these...

01:01:16.911 --> 01:01:19.480
He's like
the first millennial gangster.

01:01:19.514 --> 01:01:21.315
Yeah, it's the future
of drug trafficking,

01:01:21.348 --> 01:01:23.951
I'm telling ya.
I ain't seen nothing like it.

01:01:23.984 --> 01:01:26.287
All these other young bucks, they think
I'm some kind of old fucking dinosaur.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.022
They're doing
their digital downloads.

01:01:28.055 --> 01:01:29.924
But I'm the one
with these fucking hooks in.

01:01:29.957 --> 01:01:32.426
I'm the one who's gonna bring
this fucking prick down.

01:01:33.427 --> 01:01:36.797
This is exactly how you
sounded before Puerto Rico.

01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:39.300
No, it's not how it was like
in Puerto Rico.

01:01:39.333 --> 01:01:41.202
- It's different?
- Yeah, completely different.

01:01:41.235 --> 01:01:42.269
- Is it?
- Yeah.

01:01:42.303 --> 01:01:43.337
Is it, Rick? Really?

01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:44.838
What's going on in Utah?

01:01:45.906 --> 01:01:48.042
What the... What?

01:01:48.075 --> 01:01:49.910
- What?
- Yeah. What?

01:01:49.944 --> 01:01:52.012
I get the same high-purchase
alerts you do, okay?

01:01:52.046 --> 01:01:54.982
Tell me what the fuck
is going on in Utah.

01:01:57.451 --> 01:02:00.254
Cyber conference. Yeah.

01:02:00.287 --> 01:02:02.156
- It's a cyber conference? Okay.
- Yeah.

01:02:02.189 --> 01:02:03.857
- And you're paying for it?
- No.

01:02:03.891 --> 01:02:05.059
They haven't
requisitioned the money yet.

01:02:05.092 --> 01:02:06.193
They'll pay me back.

01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:11.198
You know, the thing
about being married to a narc

01:02:11.232 --> 01:02:14.235
is that you never know
when they're lying to you.

01:02:17.572 --> 01:02:18.973
Let's go. Engage.

01:02:25.879 --> 01:02:27.948
"Weird Al" Yankovic.

01:02:27.982 --> 01:02:29.483
Let's go.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.803
Get under there! Get the fucking...

01:02:49.837 --> 01:02:52.172
- Hands where I can see them!
- Don't fucking move!

01:02:52.206 --> 01:02:54.275
- Down now!
- Down on the fucking ground!

01:02:54.609 --> 01:02:58.312
- What? You fucking deaf? Huh? You what? Huh?
- I can help.

01:02:58.345 --> 01:03:00.347
- I can tell you anything you want to know.
- Huh? Yeah?

01:03:00.781 --> 01:03:03.217
Thought he was gonna win
the fucking penalty shoot, yeah?

01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:05.252
Well, no, you don't fucking know.
What do you got here?

01:03:05.286 --> 01:03:07.488
- What is this? Is this your fanny pack?
- Yeah.

01:03:07.921 --> 01:03:11.425
A fucking fanny pack?
Dude, your mother know about this? Huh?

01:03:14.228 --> 01:03:15.796
Huh?

01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:17.565
Whoa!

01:03:18.232 --> 01:03:20.367
- Yeah!
- It's... I... It's for my taxes.

01:03:20.401 --> 01:03:22.102
Fat, fucking roll, dude.

01:03:22.136 --> 01:03:23.971
I don't like bank...
I don't trust banks.

01:03:24.506 --> 01:03:26.440
Fucking hook this prick up
and voucher this.

01:03:30.077 --> 01:03:32.846
Clean your fucking ears out.
What did I say?

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.049
I said go take a sketch of the
premises and then report back to me.

01:03:36.283 --> 01:03:37.418
You boys got a light?

01:03:45.225 --> 01:03:47.194
Where the fuck do they find these guys?
I swear to God.

01:03:47.227 --> 01:03:49.363
Well, probably
a fucking vegetarian.

01:03:54.201 --> 01:03:56.203
You know,
swear to fucking God, dude.

01:03:57.672 --> 01:03:59.340
This whole job's changed.

01:04:00.608 --> 01:04:03.645
Well, we certainly can't get
shit done the way we used to.

01:04:03.678 --> 01:04:05.179
Fucking A.

01:04:09.651 --> 01:04:11.218
Don't know about you,
but I don't have

01:04:11.251 --> 01:04:13.555
the fucking patience
for this bullshit.

01:04:13.588 --> 01:04:16.223
Flung out the paperwork and that.
You know what I'm saying?

01:04:17.257 --> 01:04:19.126
No. What are you saying?

01:04:19.159 --> 01:04:21.095
I'm saying I can take it
from here if you want.

01:04:23.063 --> 01:04:24.231
Is it gonna
come back on me?

01:04:25.466 --> 01:04:27.201
Do I look like a vegetarian?

01:05:02.537 --> 01:05:05.038
Where the fuck
are you, Curtis?

01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:10.043
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:05:10.077 --> 01:05:12.680
- Have you eaten anything?
- I'm fine.

01:05:15.717 --> 01:05:17.552
- You know, I'm starting to get a little...
- Don't!

01:05:19.319 --> 01:05:20.588
I'm sorry.

01:05:23.023 --> 01:05:24.559
I'm really sorry. I...

01:05:25.426 --> 01:05:27.995
Look, I am running
a $50 million company,

01:05:28.028 --> 01:05:29.731
operating in
17 different countries

01:05:29.764 --> 01:05:31.398
with exactly one employee

01:05:31.432 --> 01:05:33.100
who just dropped off
the face of the Earth.

01:05:33.133 --> 01:05:35.469
It's just a website, Ross!

01:05:40.207 --> 01:05:41.475
It's the thing.

01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:45.613
And you would know that,
except you've never done anything.

01:05:54.254 --> 01:05:56.423
I'm gonna go for a run.

01:05:56.957 --> 01:06:00.194
And when I come back,
I want you and all your shit out of here.

01:06:00.227 --> 01:06:01.596
You hear me?

01:06:12.206 --> 01:06:15.042
<i>Please, sir,
this guy we're dealing with,</i>

01:06:15.075 --> 01:06:20.314
he's got unlimited resources
and he's unpredictable...

01:06:20.347 --> 01:06:22.717
I'm gonna break your fucking
nose, and I'm gonna do it.

01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:25.385
He's... I can tell you
whatever the fuck you...

01:06:25.419 --> 01:06:28.088
I'll write a term paper,
for fuck's sake!

01:06:28.121 --> 01:06:29.657
- Money.
- The money.

01:06:29.691 --> 01:06:32.125
I know all about
how the money works.

01:06:32.159 --> 01:06:33.695
- So?
- Okay.

01:06:33.728 --> 01:06:36.196
There's Bitcoin.
Are you familiar with Bitcoin?

01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:37.799
Bitcoin?

01:06:37.832 --> 01:06:40.300
- Don't be a fucking cunt, Curtis.
- Oh, fuck!

01:06:40.334 --> 01:06:43.203
Don't be a cunt, Curtis.
Don't be a fucking cunt, dude.

01:06:43.237 --> 01:06:45.472
- Don't be a fucking cunt, okay?
- Okay, no cunt.

01:06:45.507 --> 01:06:47.040
You fat fucking cunt!

01:06:47.074 --> 01:06:48.442
Can't fucking...

01:06:48.475 --> 01:06:51.178
So, you know Bitcoin.

01:06:51.211 --> 01:06:57.084
And there's some people use
Bitcoin to transfer money.

01:06:57.117 --> 01:06:59.052
They make transactions.

01:06:59.086 --> 01:07:02.690
Those transactions on Silk Road
get put into an escrow account

01:07:02.724 --> 01:07:06.661
and then stays there until
both parties have signed off.

01:07:06.694 --> 01:07:08.530
So nobody gets ripped off.

01:07:08.563 --> 01:07:12.534
- That, and there's a ratings-based system.
- Yeah.

01:07:12.567 --> 01:07:17.371
The customer service and dependability,
reliability, it's all a big part of it.

01:07:17.404 --> 01:07:20.307
Skip the corporate bullshit, okay?
You're no global conglomerate, so...

01:07:22.276 --> 01:07:26.648
See, we are, though.
We are a global enterprise.

01:07:27.749 --> 01:07:29.449
And it's growing.

01:07:29.483 --> 01:07:31.619
Not growing by the week
or the month,

01:07:31.653 --> 01:07:33.420
it's growing by the hour.

01:07:33.453 --> 01:07:36.824
And at the crest of it
is fucking DPR and he's...

01:07:36.858 --> 01:07:38.425
He's a visionary.

01:07:40.595 --> 01:07:42.062
No shit.

01:07:42.897 --> 01:07:44.532
And what are you?
An apostle?

01:07:45.065 --> 01:07:47.635
In pink fucking socks
and Crocs, dude?

01:07:48.201 --> 01:07:50.838
I'm the one...

01:07:50.872 --> 01:07:53.741
I may look like
a fucking idiot to you,

01:07:53.775 --> 01:07:56.476
but I am the one who has access
to the escrow account.

01:07:59.379 --> 01:08:01.214
Fucking holding out on me,
dude.

01:08:02.617 --> 01:08:04.384
- Okay.
- No, I'll tell you anything.

01:08:04.418 --> 01:08:05.787
You're gonna prove it
is what you're gonna do.

01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:07.421
I'll prove anything.
How?

01:08:09.857 --> 01:08:11.491
Wire me the Bitcoin.

01:08:15.597 --> 01:08:17.665
That's...
That's not how it...

01:08:17.698 --> 01:08:19.332
That is how it works,
but it's not how it works.

01:08:19.366 --> 01:08:21.234
Well, what are you
gonna do with the...

01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:24.839
Gonna mark it Exhibit A in
the case against your boss.

01:08:24.872 --> 01:08:26.340
Oh.

01:08:26.874 --> 01:08:30.645
Okay. I appreciate what you're
doing, but this is...

01:08:31.345 --> 01:08:35.482
It's like $200,000 or
something in the account.

01:08:35.515 --> 01:08:37.417
He could kill me
for that type of money.

01:08:40.587 --> 01:08:41.622
Really?

01:08:44.323 --> 01:08:45.560
What?

01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:52.600
What the fuck?

01:09:06.345 --> 01:09:08.916
What the fuck are you doing
with my money, Curtis?

01:09:13.755 --> 01:09:16.223
Got you,
you son of a bitch.

01:09:22.429 --> 01:09:24.532
Hey, Max!
Your parents still in Aspen?

01:09:24.564 --> 01:09:26.265
- Holy shit!
- Hey, man.

01:09:26.299 --> 01:09:28.569
The prodigal son returns.

01:09:28.603 --> 01:09:30.837
- Yeah.
- Yes, it has been a while.

01:09:30.872 --> 01:09:33.240
Yup, it's been
six weeks, dude.

01:09:34.942 --> 01:09:39.546
Hey, uh, look,
I got a favor to ask you.

01:09:40.212 --> 01:09:43.450
If I give you someone's ID, can you
look up if they've been arrested or not?

01:09:44.451 --> 01:09:47.755
Why do you always come to me
with this shit, Ross?

01:09:48.488 --> 01:09:50.357
'Cause you're my best friend.

01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:57.699
What's their name?

01:09:59.567 --> 01:10:01.903
Uh, Curtis Clark Green.

01:10:02.937 --> 01:10:04.972
Out of Spanish Fork, Utah.

01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:12.747
You, uh...
You having a party?

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:15.248
If you'd read any of my texts
for the last six weeks,

01:10:15.282 --> 01:10:17.952
you'd know
I'm moving to New York.

01:10:17.985 --> 01:10:19.219
Surprise!

01:10:24.491 --> 01:10:25.960
Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:10:32.466 --> 01:10:34.401
Okay, that's weird.

01:10:34.434 --> 01:10:37.839
There's a report for his arrest
in Spanish Fork, Utah,

01:10:37.872 --> 01:10:40.942
but, for some reason,
he was never charged.

01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:44.645
Weird-looking dude.

01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:46.981
Shit.

01:10:54.622 --> 01:10:55.923
Shit.

01:10:57.859 --> 01:10:59.961
You know,
Julia warned you about this.

01:10:59.994 --> 01:11:01.929
- Fuck!
- We both did.

01:11:17.444 --> 01:11:20.413
"Got a problem in Utah.
Requires violence. Can you help?"

01:11:21.682 --> 01:11:24.719
Yes, we can.

01:11:26.419 --> 01:11:27.755
Uh...

01:11:36.898 --> 01:11:38.666
Hey, Julia.

01:11:38.699 --> 01:11:40.635
- Julia, look, just talk to me. Just talk!
- No!

01:11:40.668 --> 01:11:43.538
You're selling assault rifles
on your fucking site, Ross.

01:11:44.471 --> 01:11:49.010
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
It's the Second Amendment.

01:11:49.744 --> 01:11:53.380
When you said that you were
gonna change the world, I just...

01:11:54.782 --> 01:11:56.651
I wanted to believe
that it was for the better.

01:11:56.684 --> 01:11:59.020
- That's not fair.
- Okay.

01:11:59.053 --> 01:12:01.488
That's not...
Julia, just listen.

01:12:01.522 --> 01:12:03.591
- Leave me alone, Ross.
- Listen to me.

01:12:03.624 --> 01:12:05.560
You heard her, asshole.

01:12:05.593 --> 01:12:06.761
Fuck off.

01:12:11.632 --> 01:12:14.669
That's nice. That's nice.

01:12:19.607 --> 01:12:21.909
Here. Thank you.

01:12:21.943 --> 01:12:23.443
Will you get me a shot?

01:12:23.476 --> 01:12:25.112
- Anything for you.
- Yeah.

01:12:25.146 --> 01:12:27.582
- Hey. You're too good for him anyway.
- Yeah.

01:13:14.494 --> 01:13:18.165
Huh? Huh?

01:13:20.768 --> 01:13:24.205
- Fuck, Bowden, you dumb fuck!
- Ah!

01:13:24.238 --> 01:13:26.207
Shit didn't even record.

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.943
I did what you asked me to do.
I transferred the money!

01:13:28.976 --> 01:13:30.912
Why the fuck
are you doing this?

01:13:30.945 --> 01:13:34.115
Because, my friend,
if we pin some bullshit narcotics beef

01:13:34.148 --> 01:13:36.217
on your fucking pirate boss,

01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:39.687
he's gonna post bail, walk free
and wanna chase up loose ends.

01:13:40.321 --> 01:13:42.223
And we know who that is.
On the other hand,

01:13:42.256 --> 01:13:45.559
if we get him on a conspiracy
to commit murder and kidnapping,

01:13:45.593 --> 01:13:47.528
well, that's 25 years to life.

01:13:47.561 --> 01:13:50.197
- What? What, murder?
- Nice, dude, here we go.

01:13:50.231 --> 01:13:53.734
- Why did you say murder? No!
- That's what I fucking said, dude. Here, come on.

01:13:53.768 --> 01:13:55.069
Get the fuck up.

01:15:09.577 --> 01:15:13.114
Damn, Curtis, your boss just caught a bullet train

01:15:13.147 --> 01:15:14.782
to the fucking pen, dude.

01:15:14.815 --> 01:15:16.250
Look at this.

01:15:16.283 --> 01:15:18.552
"Change the order
from torture to kill."

01:15:20.087 --> 01:15:21.722
Fuck me, dude.

01:15:22.957 --> 01:15:25.726
What... what's that for?

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:28.729
Huh? This is lunch.
You hungry?

01:15:29.597 --> 01:15:31.065
Little piece of advice.

01:15:31.499 --> 01:15:33.267
The asphyxiation victim,

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:35.136
the bile looks exactly like
chicken noodle soup.

01:15:35.169 --> 01:15:36.604
Open up.

01:15:36.637 --> 01:15:37.838
What, should I just chew it?

01:15:37.872 --> 01:15:39.607
Open up, dude, open up.

01:15:41.042 --> 01:15:44.111
Here we go. You got it.
Keep it in.

01:15:45.246 --> 01:15:47.148
Okay, don't choke on that.
Lie down.

01:15:47.181 --> 01:15:49.884
Play dead.

01:15:50.317 --> 01:15:52.920
Clean that up. I'll get that fucking
shit out of there, there you go.

01:15:53.421 --> 01:15:55.256
Curtis,
just give me a second here.

01:15:56.690 --> 01:15:58.159
All right.

01:15:59.693 --> 01:16:01.896
Come on, Curtis,
hold your breath, dude. Fuck!

01:16:02.763 --> 01:16:04.832
Close your eyes. All right.

01:16:04.865 --> 01:16:08.002
Oh, I love that dribbling out, it's nice.

01:16:20.915 --> 01:16:24.218
Hey, you need a ride?
Yeah, you need a ride?

01:16:25.119 --> 01:16:26.587
Ross!

01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:11.265
Boom, motherfucker.

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:28.983
- Hey.
- FBI cybercrimes has taken over the investigation.

01:17:29.016 --> 01:17:31.385
Good. Hold the fucking phone.
I got the entire case right here.

01:17:31.418 --> 01:17:33.220
Now, whatever it is,
turn it over to Tarbell.

01:17:33.254 --> 01:17:35.022
No, hear me out.
You're gonna wanna see this.

01:17:35.055 --> 01:17:36.290
- Trust me.
- No, I'm not. Not on the desk.

01:17:36.323 --> 01:17:37.958
- Not the desk.
- Come on, here.

01:17:37.992 --> 01:17:39.827
- Listen, Rick...
- I got the guy dead to rights.

01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:41.428
- Hang on.
- Rick!

01:17:41.462 --> 01:17:43.464
- It's just... Hang on.
- I don't have the time.

01:17:43.497 --> 01:17:45.199
This department
doesn't have the money, okay,

01:17:45.232 --> 01:17:46.767
to teach you
how law enforcement works

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.068
in the 21st century.

01:17:48.102 --> 01:17:49.403
So take your handwritten notes,

01:17:49.436 --> 01:17:50.771
shove them in your Brownwell

01:17:50.804 --> 01:17:52.173
and hand it over to Tarbell.

01:17:52.206 --> 01:17:53.274
- Okay?
- Just... Come on.

01:17:53.307 --> 01:17:54.742
Trust me. Look at this. Just...

01:17:54.775 --> 01:17:55.809
I'll say it again.

01:17:58.312 --> 01:17:59.780
Out!

01:18:02.249 --> 01:18:05.186
Hey, it's Shields.
In Cybercrimes.

01:18:06.787 --> 01:18:08.055
Yeah, get me Johnson.

01:18:09.190 --> 01:18:10.791
All right, well,
then get me Hanson.

01:18:12.426 --> 01:18:13.928
Get me anybody here, okay?

01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:18.799
<i>This is Seven News.</i>

01:18:18.832 --> 01:18:21.001
<i>Tonight, 16-year-old

after his school ball</i>

01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:25.873

from a second-floor balcony.</i>

<i>His family
still can't believe he's gone.</i>

01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:32.413

seen what he turned out to be.

01:18:37.017 --> 01:18:39.987

- Hey.
- Hey.

01:18:51.465 --> 01:18:53.267
- Mom and Dad called.
- Oh, yeah?

01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:55.102
Yeah, they were just
asking how you were.

01:18:55.803 --> 01:18:56.937
What did you say?

01:18:56.971 --> 01:18:58.105
That I love having you here.

01:18:59.406 --> 01:19:01.041
It's great to be here.

01:19:03.277 --> 01:19:04.845
Why do you keep
closing your laptop

01:19:04.878 --> 01:19:06.413
every time I walk by?

01:19:07.248 --> 01:19:08.382
I don't.

01:19:08.816 --> 01:19:10.451
Yeah, Ross,
you do.

01:19:11.752 --> 01:19:17.124
I guess I don't even notice it. It's just
force of habit, you know, sensitive data.

01:19:17.157 --> 01:19:19.159
Wow, you look like Dad
when you lie.

01:19:22.863 --> 01:19:25.132
Hey, whatever's going on,
you can tell me.

01:19:30.437 --> 01:19:32.306
Nothing's going on, Cally.

01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:35.242
All right, fine, you know,
you wanna bullshit me, whatever.

01:19:35.276 --> 01:19:37.579
Just, uh, don't lie
to yourself, Ross,

01:19:37.612 --> 01:19:39.480
'cause that's how you get lost.

01:21:03.063 --> 01:21:04.431
Shh.

01:21:08.168 --> 01:21:10.170
What's the matter?
Is she having a nightmare?

01:21:11.071 --> 01:21:13.173
- She didn't get the scholarship.
- What?

01:21:13.207 --> 01:21:15.876
Why not? Didn't you
put the application in?

01:21:16.443 --> 01:21:20.013
I put the application in. You didn't
show up to the fucking interview.

01:21:20.047 --> 01:21:23.050
Shit. Fuck.
Fuck, I forgot. Shit.

01:21:24.051 --> 01:21:25.553
I didn't make it.

01:21:25.587 --> 01:21:29.156
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay, peanut. Hey.

01:21:30.457 --> 01:21:32.159
Can I go anyway?

01:21:33.961 --> 01:21:35.095
Go to sleep.

01:21:54.982 --> 01:21:57.217
Damn it, homie. What the fuck
are you doing over here?

01:21:57.251 --> 01:21:59.319
Don't get your panties in a twist.
I'm not staying, okay?

Personal
or professional reasons?

01:22:09.363 --> 01:22:10.565
Answer the question.

01:22:18.005 --> 01:22:19.641

when it's gone,</i>

so, just, please,
answer the question.

01:22:24.612 --> 01:22:25.713
Give me a day.

01:22:25.747 --> 01:22:27.080
For what?

01:22:28.148 --> 01:22:30.652
To make it green,
motherfucker.

01:22:30.685 --> 01:22:32.219
All right.

01:22:36.190 --> 01:22:38.992
You sure
about this shit, yo?

01:22:39.026 --> 01:22:40.595

01:23:06.754 --> 01:23:09.490
<i>that goes on
behind the scenes here.</i>

01:23:09.524 --> 01:23:13.728
<i>But I have to stay constantly on
the move to keep ahead of the state.</i>

01:23:13.761 --> 01:23:17.765
<i>I know this whole market is
based on the trust you put in me,</i>

01:23:17.799 --> 01:23:20.267
<i>and I don't take that lightly.</i>

01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:22.770
<i>The way I see it,
we are all players</i>

01:23:22.804 --> 01:23:27.174
<i>in something that has grown
beyond any of us.</i>

01:23:27.207 --> 01:23:30.578
<i>Rarely do I lift my head
long enough to take in</i>

01:23:30.612 --> 01:23:32.580
<i>just how amazing
all of this is.</i>

01:23:34.414 --> 01:23:36.250
<i>I have no one
to share my thoughts with</i>

01:23:36.283 --> 01:23:37.785
<i>in physical space.</i>

01:23:37.819 --> 01:23:39.453
<i>Security does not
permit it anymore.</i>

01:23:41.455 --> 01:23:44.526
<i>So, thanks for listening.</i>

01:23:48.195 --> 01:23:50.497
This guy's clearly self-taught.
Even though he fixed it,

01:23:50.532 --> 01:23:53.601
we could read the previous version
underneath. Nice job, Kim. Okay.

01:23:53.635 --> 01:23:55.402
Goddamn it. What, Bowden?

01:23:55.435 --> 01:23:57.371
Uh, I was told
to give you this.

01:23:57.404 --> 01:23:59.373
Just put it somewhere.

01:23:59.406 --> 01:24:04.378
Ladies and gentlemen,
the IP address of the Silk Road server.

01:24:07.214 --> 01:24:09.483
- Holy shit.
- All right, get to work.

01:24:11.385 --> 01:24:12.854
Kim,
do we have a physical address?

01:24:12.887 --> 01:24:14.789
He's hosted on
a server farm in Iceland.

01:24:14.822 --> 01:24:17.190
Okay, I'll call the AUSA.

01:24:17.224 --> 01:24:19.493
And within 24 hours,
we'll be monitoring this guy in real time.

01:24:21.395 --> 01:24:23.598
- Hey, what if it is encrypted chats, too?
- Huh?

01:24:23.631 --> 01:24:26.333
No. But when we bust
him, we'll seize his laptop,

01:24:26.366 --> 01:24:27.735
and then we'll get everything.

01:24:27.769 --> 01:24:29.771
Everyone he ever dealt with.

01:24:31.873 --> 01:24:35.075
...Iceland, you prosecute him right
here and I need to confirm now.

01:24:36.243 --> 01:24:37.712
With a little luck,
we'll do it.

01:24:54.328 --> 01:24:55.830
Hey. I need your help
with something.

01:24:55.863 --> 01:24:57.397
You don't knock?

01:24:57.999 --> 01:25:01.435
Look, it's no secret you and
I don't see eye to eye, okay?

01:25:01.903 --> 01:25:05.740
- No.
- I know that you know that I think you're a...

01:25:06.808 --> 01:25:07.875
Well, you're a dick.

01:25:08.610 --> 01:25:10.778
Yeah.

01:25:10.812 --> 01:25:15.382
But Tarbell's a bigger dick,
and I hear he may have found DPR.

01:25:15.415 --> 01:25:17.150
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:25:17.184 --> 01:25:18.519
- He hasn't said anything to me.
- He wouldn't.

01:25:18.553 --> 01:25:20.454
But I got a source
at the Bureau.

01:25:20.487 --> 01:25:22.189
Says there's a kid
ordering fake passports

01:25:22.222 --> 01:25:23.591
in San Francisco...

01:25:24.424 --> 01:25:26.493
under the name Josh Terrey.

01:25:28.563 --> 01:25:30.163
- Josh Terrey.
- Yeah.

01:25:30.197 --> 01:25:32.366
- In San Francisco.
- Yeah.

01:25:32.399 --> 01:25:36.169
Homeland Security's got him
under 24-hour surveillance.

01:25:37.605 --> 01:25:38.940
So, what do you want
from me?

01:25:38.973 --> 01:25:40.642
You got anyone on the ground
out there

01:25:40.675 --> 01:25:42.209
who might be able
to check it out for us?

01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:44.779
Get us in the game?

01:25:44.812 --> 01:25:47.515
But you thought boots on the
ground was a waste of time.

01:25:47.949 --> 01:25:49.517
Call it an exception,
right?

01:25:51.919 --> 01:25:53.721
Yeah.

01:25:53.755 --> 01:25:57.324
Well, it's just too bad
that I am a dick.

01:25:58.126 --> 01:26:01.696
Real shame.
Real fucking shame.

01:26:14.842 --> 01:26:16.476
Three days
sitting on this prick.

01:26:16.911 --> 01:26:19.514
I'm missing
my kid's PONY League playoffs.

01:26:19.547 --> 01:26:21.749
Package is on his doorstep.
It's not like he doesn't know it's there.

01:26:21.783 --> 01:26:22.950
Let's jam him.

01:26:22.984 --> 01:26:24.484
Yes, ma'am.

01:26:43.871 --> 01:26:45.606
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:26:46.974 --> 01:26:48.543
- I think you have the wrong address.
- Oh, no.

01:26:49.777 --> 01:26:51.244
I'm Nob.

01:26:52.947 --> 01:26:54.448
Yeah, step aside.

01:26:55.717 --> 01:26:57.417
- How did you find me?
- Close the door.

01:27:03.423 --> 01:27:05.660
- How'd you find me?
- How fucking old are you, dude?

01:27:06.259 --> 01:27:07.762
- Twenty-seven.
- Yeah?

01:27:08.361 --> 01:27:10.230
- Yeah.
- You've been shaving long?

01:27:10.865 --> 01:27:11.933
What?

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:15.570
You have two federal agents in
an unmarked across the street.

01:27:16.037 --> 01:27:18.539
- They're here to arrest you for...
- Wait. What hap...

01:27:18.573 --> 01:27:23.578
Shh... ordering fake passports
off the Silk Road. Yeah.

01:27:23.611 --> 01:27:27.481
When they knock on that door,
this is what you're gonna tell 'em.

01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:33.988
Joshua Terrey?

01:27:34.021 --> 01:27:35.656
- Yeah.
- Agent Conroy.

01:27:35.690 --> 01:27:37.859
Homeland Security.
This is Agent Ramirez.

01:27:37.892 --> 01:27:38.926
This belong to you?

01:27:39.359 --> 01:27:41.896
Contains fake IDs
and passports.

01:27:41.929 --> 01:27:43.664
Do you know anything about that?

01:27:47.935 --> 01:27:49.670
Can I see that for a second?

01:27:50.838 --> 01:27:51.906
Yeah.

01:27:52.707 --> 01:27:56.878
Shit. Well, it says right
there, "No signature required."

01:27:56.911 --> 01:27:59.714
Meaning, I haven't
taken possession of it.

01:28:00.347 --> 01:28:02.784
Which is why you knocked
instead of kicked.

01:28:04.986 --> 01:28:10.825
Well, anybody could have ordered that,
you know, off the Silk Road, for instance.

01:28:10.858 --> 01:28:12.527
With your pictures?

01:28:13.661 --> 01:28:18.800
- It's a free country. Now, um...
- if you'll excuse me...

01:28:19.267 --> 01:28:22.837
Sorry I couldn't help you guys
out, but I got some work to do.

01:28:23.503 --> 01:28:24.739
Have a nice day.

01:28:34.749 --> 01:28:36.617
- Holy fucking shit.
- Yeah.

01:28:39.654 --> 01:28:40.822
Now what?

01:28:40.855 --> 01:28:41.889
Now...

01:28:43.090 --> 01:28:45.425
you delete
our fucking chat history.

01:28:46.527 --> 01:28:47.562
Yeah.

01:28:47.595 --> 01:28:48.696
- Like, now.
- Yeah.

01:28:48.729 --> 01:28:50.497
- Do it.
- Yeah. Just...

01:28:55.570 --> 01:28:57.337
You think
this is a fucking game?

01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:02.743
- All of it.
- Yeah. Just give me a second.

01:29:02.777 --> 01:29:04.145
You think I'm
going down 'cause of you?

01:29:04.178 --> 01:29:05.746
I ain't going down
because of you.

01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:08.516
It's gone. It's done.

01:29:09.016 --> 01:29:10.450
Fucking better be.

01:29:13.087 --> 01:29:16.791
Next time,
just don't be such a smart ass.

01:29:20.728 --> 01:29:21.996
Yeah.

01:29:39.814 --> 01:29:41.115
Fuck!

01:29:47.755 --> 01:29:48.990
Fuck!

01:30:10.578 --> 01:30:12.747
What you doing back there, Rayford?
You rubbing it out?

01:30:14.749 --> 01:30:17.218
You better not be fucking telling
me you lost my Bitcoin, Ray.

01:30:24.091 --> 01:30:25.893
"Don't trip.

01:30:27.028 --> 01:30:28.663
I got your back."

01:30:39.073 --> 01:30:42.810
You motherfucking,
ingrate cocksucker. Fuck.

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:47.615
The fuck is that?

01:30:47.648 --> 01:30:50.151
- It's 37K, yo.
- Thirty-seven K?

01:30:50.184 --> 01:30:52.753
Dude, I had fucking 200K
in my Bitcoin wallet.

01:30:52.787 --> 01:30:55.488
Well, it's not my fault that Bitcoin
been going up and down and shit.

01:30:55.523 --> 01:30:57.091
It's fucking volatile.

01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:00.493
Won't even
fucking last me a year.

01:31:01.228 --> 01:31:03.597
Tuition's 40 fucking grand.

01:31:04.031 --> 01:31:07.735
- Motherfucker. Unbelievable.
- Forty fucking grand?

01:31:07.768 --> 01:31:10.871
I thought your kid was in
pre-school, yo. Shit.

01:31:11.539 --> 01:31:14.942
I don't care. Gonna see how
much time we got to negotiate.

01:31:17.545 --> 01:31:20.982
- Tarbell.
- Any word from the Icelandic Embassy?

01:31:21.015 --> 01:31:24.151
My guys are heading to Reykjavik in
an hour. When it goes, it goes fast.

01:31:24.185 --> 01:31:26.187
<i>How long
until his servers are mirrored?</i>

01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:28.022
Twelve hours from when they
hit the Thor Data Center.

01:31:28.055 --> 01:31:30.825
And it's what,
seven, eight hours' flight?

01:31:30.858 --> 01:31:32.693
What are you, a travel agent?

01:31:32.727 --> 01:31:34.128
<i>No, man. Just seeing
if you need any backup.</i>

01:31:34.161 --> 01:31:36.764
Negative, Bowden.
Fucking guy.

01:31:38.332 --> 01:31:39.900
We got 19 hours.

01:31:39.934 --> 01:31:40.968
Then what?

01:31:43.037 --> 01:31:45.106
Then I take care of my family.

01:31:45.139 --> 01:31:48.142
Set up a new user profile for
me, Friendly Chemist.

01:31:48.175 --> 01:31:50.111
Shit. Bowden,
you know something, huh?

01:31:50.144 --> 01:31:51.579
Hmm.

01:31:52.413 --> 01:31:55.282
He wants to fuck me in the ass,
he can pay for the privilege.

01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:11.198
Fucking bullshit.

01:32:17.238 --> 01:32:20.941
- No. No. No.
- Piece of shit.

01:32:20.975 --> 01:32:24.011
Ah. I'm gonna
send you something, okay?

01:32:24.045 --> 01:32:25.880
Send him this.

01:32:27.148 --> 01:32:29.550
Is that
his fucking IP address, yo?

01:32:30.017 --> 01:32:31.285
That'll wake him up.

01:32:39.193 --> 01:32:40.227
Shit.

01:32:57.778 --> 01:32:59.280
What's so funny, dude?

01:32:59.313 --> 01:33:01.749
We're on a fucking stakeout,
you know, right?

01:33:01.782 --> 01:33:03.250
Well, it's more like
a shakedown, remember?

01:33:03.284 --> 01:33:04.318
I guess so.

01:33:09.857 --> 01:33:11.692
Fuck, yeah,
I do international jobs.

01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:15.863
Friendly fucking Chemist
from British Columbia.

01:33:15.896 --> 01:33:17.765
I think I might know a biker up there

01:33:17.798 --> 01:33:19.200
who could take care of business.

01:33:21.035 --> 01:33:24.705
I want you to set up another user
profile, RedWhiteAndBlue.

01:33:24.738 --> 01:33:27.241
Fucking Bowden,
a stone-cold criminal.

01:33:27.875 --> 01:33:29.877
When the fuck
you learn how to do that?

01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:32.279
<i>Hey, it's Cally. Uh...</i>

01:33:32.313 --> 01:33:35.149
<i>We are here at the restaurant,
and it is beautiful.</i>

01:33:35.182 --> 01:33:37.818
<i>And I have no idea</i>
<i>where you are.</i>

01:33:38.553 --> 01:33:41.956
<i>Dad is getting really hungry.
Please hurry. Okay, love you, bye.</i>

01:33:42.490 --> 01:33:43.924
You're a major...

01:33:44.458 --> 01:33:46.227
Hey, sorry I'm late.

01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:49.196
- Hi, sweetheart. Hi.
- Hey.

01:33:49.864 --> 01:33:52.700
- You look great.
- You look stressed.

01:33:52.733 --> 01:33:54.935
Oh, no.
It's just work stuff, you know?

01:33:56.003 --> 01:33:58.172
How was the flight? Oh.

01:33:58.672 --> 01:34:01.075
I don't know why you wasted
money on business class.

01:34:03.911 --> 01:34:08.249
Uh... Well, reservation's under my name.
Ulbricht.

01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:11.118
Follow me.

01:34:11.152 --> 01:34:12.786
Listen, I'll see you guys
in there.

01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:13.921
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:34:14.523 --> 01:34:16.290
- You doing okay?
- Yeah.

01:34:17.324 --> 01:34:19.827
- You sure?
- Yeah. No, I'm good.

01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:22.696
Okay.
Don't let me strain it.

01:34:41.782 --> 01:34:43.350
Cold, bitch. Cold.

01:34:43.384 --> 01:34:46.420
- Please.
- Fuck, dude.

01:34:48.189 --> 01:34:50.124
Fucker, hit him back, though.

01:35:04.438 --> 01:35:05.472
We can just order.

01:35:05.507 --> 01:35:07.741
No. Let's wait for him.

01:35:36.804 --> 01:35:38.839
We got him. Let's go.

01:35:40.174 --> 01:35:42.076
Checkmate, motherfucker.

01:35:48.882 --> 01:35:50.384
Here he comes.
We'll wait.

01:35:50.417 --> 01:35:51.885
I'm sorry about that.

01:35:53.053 --> 01:35:56.156
Work's been, uh... crazy.

01:35:58.826 --> 01:36:00.227
Hey.

01:36:02.997 --> 01:36:05.366
I'm really proud of you
and how hard you're working.

01:36:08.202 --> 01:36:10.271
I guess you found the thing.

01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:14.174
Yeah.

01:37:17.171 --> 01:37:19.541
How the fuck
do you eat that shit, yo?

01:37:19.574 --> 01:37:22.209
- The fuck you got against bear claws, huh?
- Fucking disgusting.

01:37:22.677 --> 01:37:26.447
Don't even got a fucking half-and-half
at this bullshit-ass donut shop.

01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:28.382
The fuck is this?

01:37:28.415 --> 01:37:30.951
You call me out here to watch
you eat a fucking bear claw?

01:37:36.558 --> 01:37:38.459
I want you
to give that to Sandy.

01:37:45.299 --> 01:37:47.501
You could still get out
from under this, right?

01:37:47.935 --> 01:37:49.403
Right.

01:37:51.071 --> 01:37:52.373
Tired, man.

01:37:54.208 --> 01:37:55.442
"Tired, man."

01:37:57.177 --> 01:37:59.046
Don't give up, Rick.

01:37:59.079 --> 01:38:01.014
You know, man...

01:38:02.282 --> 01:38:03.618
I was wrong about you.

01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:07.087
You are a friend.

01:38:10.625 --> 01:38:12.025
Don't let me down.

01:38:37.184 --> 01:38:39.486
He's on the move.
Got his laptop with him.

01:38:39.521 --> 01:38:41.021
<i>Which way is he coming?</i>

01:38:42.657 --> 01:38:44.191
Right at you.

01:38:44.692 --> 01:38:46.059
Fuck.

01:38:51.031 --> 01:38:52.534
How can I help you?

01:38:52.567 --> 01:38:55.102
- Iced tea, please.
- Sure. It'll be three dollars.

01:39:01.175 --> 01:39:03.545
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

01:39:15.289 --> 01:39:16.490
On him.

01:39:17.625 --> 01:39:20.093
<i>Blue hoodie, jeans,
flip-flops,</i>

01:39:20.127 --> 01:39:22.162
<i>on foot, westbound
towards target location.</i>

01:39:22.196 --> 01:39:24.431
<i>I'm letting him go,
confirm when you have a visual.</i>

01:39:28.670 --> 01:39:31.271
<i>For years,
I was frustrated</i>

01:39:31.305 --> 01:39:33.508
<i>by what seemed to be
the insurmountable barriers</i>

01:39:33.541 --> 01:39:38.145
<i>between the world as it is
and the world I wanted.</i>

01:39:38.178 --> 01:39:43.551
<i>So, I began making a website where people
could buy and sell anything anonymously.</i>

01:39:44.418 --> 01:39:47.755
<i>I built it because I think
the pursuit of freedom</i>

01:39:47.789 --> 01:39:50.324
<i>is the most
noble human endeavor.</i>

01:39:51.091 --> 01:39:53.327
<i>I knew the state might try
to impede it,</i>

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:56.063
<i>but if we never try
for fear of retribution,</i>

01:39:56.096 --> 01:39:57.632
<i>we have already lost,
you know?</i>

01:39:59.166 --> 01:40:01.301
<i>Silk Road is about
something much bigger</i>

01:40:01.335 --> 01:40:03.470
<i>than thumbing your nose
at the man.</i>

01:40:04.806 --> 01:40:08.275
<i>It's about taking back
our liberty.</i>

01:40:08.308 --> 01:40:12.346
<i>And as corny as it sounds,
I just wanna look back at my life</i>

01:40:12.379 --> 01:40:15.382
<i>and know that I did something
that helped people.</i>

01:40:21.421 --> 01:40:24.526
Nobody moves until my go.
He doesn't log in, we abort.

01:40:24.559 --> 01:40:27.261
And I repeat,
if he closes the laptop,

01:40:27.294 --> 01:40:29.162
<i>data's encrypted
and we got shit.</i>

01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:31.666
<i>Everybody calm the fuck down.</i>

01:40:31.699 --> 01:40:33.635
Just calm the fuck down.
We got this. Here we go.

01:40:33.668 --> 01:40:35.770
Okay, let's get
the reception on one.

01:40:35.803 --> 01:40:38.238
Uh, I wanna see surveillance
perimeter on three right there.

01:40:38.272 --> 01:40:40.575
Uh, yeah, pump that over.
Okay, we're good.

01:40:40.608 --> 01:40:43.578
Let's zoom in there.
Yeah, that's good. Yeah.

01:40:43.611 --> 01:40:45.279
We got him, huh?

01:40:45.312 --> 01:40:47.214
Shit's going down
right now. Shush.

01:40:47.247 --> 01:40:49.249
Everybody, ready? Here we go.
Let's get him.

01:40:50.852 --> 01:40:54.421
Hold, hold.
The mic on Ghost 2 isn't on.

01:40:54.454 --> 01:40:56.456
The fuck are these guys doing?

01:40:56.490 --> 01:40:58.560
What the fuck kind of Mickey
Mouse operation is this shit?

01:40:58.593 --> 01:41:02.129
The fuck, Tarbell!
All right, go down visual.

01:41:04.866 --> 01:41:06.500
<i>Ghost 2, hold your position.</i>

01:41:15.777 --> 01:41:17.579
Hey, who the fuck
is calling him?

01:41:22.249 --> 01:41:23.651
Hello?

01:41:23.685 --> 01:41:25.252
<i>Hey, kid, listen.</i>

01:41:25.954 --> 01:41:28.756
When you hit 50,
and life hasn't turned out

01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:30.625
quite the way you thought
it would when you were 28,

01:41:30.658 --> 01:41:32.594
<i>I want you
to remember one thing.</i>

01:41:34.361 --> 01:41:36.430
I got to you first,
smart ass.

01:41:48.275 --> 01:41:51.411
Do it, you son of a bitch.
Come on. Log in.

01:42:04.726 --> 01:42:06.259
And...

01:42:11.633 --> 01:42:12.867
Now.

01:42:14.301 --> 01:42:16.336
Low-life cocksucker!

01:42:17.605 --> 01:42:19.306
- Hey.
- Freeze, motherfucker.

01:42:19.339 --> 01:42:20.775
Back away from the table now.

01:42:20.808 --> 01:42:22.409
Put your hands up. Go.

01:42:24.746 --> 01:42:26.848
- Stay right there.
- Turn around and face me.

01:42:30.217 --> 01:42:31.853
- Do not move.
- Head down.

01:42:31.886 --> 01:42:34.488
- I repeat, do not move.
- Head down.

01:42:37.659 --> 01:42:39.259
Stay where you are.
Nobody move.

01:42:40.028 --> 01:42:44.431
Stay right there, sir.
Do not move. Hands up. Head down.

01:42:44.464 --> 01:42:47.802
Head down. Keep moving.
Head down. Turn around.

01:42:47.835 --> 01:42:51.806
Turn around! On your knees.
On your knees, now!

01:42:53.541 --> 01:42:55.175
Let me call you back.

01:42:57.845 --> 01:42:59.346
Just fucking...

01:42:59.881 --> 01:43:03.450
When they come, when they
come, and they will come,

01:43:04.184 --> 01:43:07.387
some millennial asshole who thinks
he can do the job better than you...

01:43:07.989 --> 01:43:10.992
I'm not talking about Shields, I'm not talking
about the DEA. I'm talking about America.

01:43:11.025 --> 01:43:13.493
This whole country is overrun
by these little assholes.

01:43:13.528 --> 01:43:15.630
And everything they know,
they learned off a screen.

01:43:16.363 --> 01:43:18.800
Not staring down
the barrel of a gun.

01:43:21.301 --> 01:43:22.937
Experience matters, Johnny.

01:43:23.437 --> 01:43:25.907
And you, above all people,
should know that.

01:43:26.507 --> 01:43:30.812
You got a whole building full of us old
war horses here. So when they come...

01:43:30.845 --> 01:43:34.281
- Bowden! Bowden!
- ...it's your job to protect them.

01:43:34.816 --> 01:43:37.652
Bowden! Bowden!

01:43:38.586 --> 01:43:40.487
Don't let that cunt cuff me.

01:43:43.891 --> 01:43:45.993
Rick, turn around.
Hands up.

01:43:46.027 --> 01:43:48.228
Hands where I can see 'em.
You're under arrest.

01:43:49.197 --> 01:43:53.034
Ross Ulbricht, you're under
arrest for narcotics trafficking,

01:43:53.067 --> 01:43:55.970
money laundering and conspiracy.

01:43:59.372 --> 01:44:00.742
It's over, son.

01:44:24.532 --> 01:44:25.767
<i>You okay?</i>

01:44:27.367 --> 01:44:29.737
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:44:29.771 --> 01:44:30.805
- <i>You look good.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:44:30.838 --> 01:44:32.006
You, too.

01:44:32.507 --> 01:44:34.842
- Yeah? You're just saying that?
- No. Mm-hmm.

01:44:38.846 --> 01:44:40.380
Is she here?

01:44:40.915 --> 01:44:43.084
- Yeah. Yeah, she's in there.
- Yeah?

01:44:43.117 --> 01:44:46.921
- I, um, wanted to talk to you first.
- Okay.

01:44:46.954 --> 01:44:48.488
Did you, uh...

01:44:49.991 --> 01:44:51.025
Did you...

01:45:02.103 --> 01:45:03.838
<i>Yeah, we got it.</i>

01:45:11.546 --> 01:45:14.782
Listen, you are always
gonna be Edie's father.

01:45:20.121 --> 01:45:21.622
Well?

01:45:28.763 --> 01:45:32.700
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I don't know.

01:45:46.446 --> 01:45:47.849
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:45:48.649 --> 01:45:49.717
Hey.

01:45:51.586 --> 01:45:54.487
Hey. Oh, peanut.

01:45:54.522 --> 01:45:55.556
Hi, Dada.

01:45:57.024 --> 01:45:58.458
So?

01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:06.000
Oh, my gosh. Wow.
Look at that, huh?

01:46:06.033 --> 01:46:09.770
Mom, you're seeing that?
Huh? Is it matching?

01:46:10.338 --> 01:46:12.472
- No?
- I made it my own way.

01:46:14.108 --> 01:46:17.377
Good girl, peanut.
Good girl.

01:46:18.546 --> 01:46:21.782
So, new school, huh?
Excited?

01:46:22.650 --> 01:46:26.453
Nervous? Little?
No, you're not nervous, are you?

01:46:26.486 --> 01:46:28.689
No, you're my big tiger,
aren't you?

01:46:28.723 --> 01:46:31.959
There you go. Huh?

01:46:34.095 --> 01:46:36.496
They're probably gonna
tell you some things, peanut.

01:46:37.665 --> 01:46:39.867
They're gonna tell you,
you're gonna hear some things, you know,

01:46:39.901 --> 01:46:41.836
say things like,
you know, life is...

01:46:43.704 --> 01:46:45.573
life is not always
black and white,

01:46:45.606 --> 01:46:48.408
but, you know, things are
more complicated than that.

01:46:49.110 --> 01:46:50.912
Okay?

01:46:50.945 --> 01:46:55.650
But here's the truth.
Okay?

01:46:59.553 --> 01:47:02.590
There's good and bad in this world.

01:47:03.591 --> 01:47:07.762
And, uh, sometimes you gotta make a
choice, you gotta pick a side, okay?

01:47:11.198 --> 01:47:13.701
I'll always be there
to tell you this...

01:47:17.104 --> 01:47:18.706
that you are loved.

01:47:23.611 --> 01:47:25.613
I love you, Dada.

01:47:47.201 --> 01:47:49.170
Okay, sweetie.

01:48:07.922 --> 01:48:11.092
<i>Silk Road was supposed to
be about giving people the freedom</i>

01:48:11.125 --> 01:48:15.997
<i>to make their own choices,
to pursue their own happiness.</i>

01:48:17.665 --> 01:48:20.768
<i>But I learned that
when you give people freedom,</i>

01:48:21.569 --> 01:48:23.537
<i>you don't know
what they'll do with it.</i>

01:48:29.043 --> 01:48:33.781
<i>Your Honor, I know you must
take away my middle years,</i>

01:48:33.814 --> 01:48:36.917
<i>but please leave me my old age.</i>

01:48:38.085 --> 01:48:41.088
<i>Please leave a small light
at the end of the tunnel,</i>

01:48:42.056 --> 01:48:44.759
<i>an excuse to stay healthy,</i>

01:48:44.792 --> 01:48:50.164
<i>an excuse to dream of better days
ahead and a chance to redeem myself...</i>
