00:00.801 --> 00:02.736
[Abbey moaning]

00:02.770 --> 00:04.138
(Dr. Taylor)
OKAY, YOU'RE DOING GOOD.
YOU'RE DOING GOOD.

00:04.172 --> 00:04.938
(Abbey)
YOU'VE STILL GOT THE THING.

00:04.972 --> 00:07.775
THE STUPID THING
IS STILL ON.

00:07.808 --> 00:08.842
(Justine)
MOM, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
YELL AT ME.

00:08.876 --> 00:11.379
I'VE BEEN IN LABOR FOR
OVER A DOZEN HOURS, JUSTINE.

00:11.412 --> 00:12.613
I HAVE TO YELL.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.682
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
MISS THE WHOLE THING.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.817
(Justine)
MOM, IT'S
A THREE-HOUR DRIVE.

00:16.850 --> 00:20.321
THAT'S WHY I CALLED YOU
YESTERDAY AFTER MY WATER BROKE.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.623
(Justine)
I'M SORRY. A PARTNER JUST
DROPPED A BRIEF ON MY DESK.

00:22.656 --> 00:23.624
(Dr. Taylor)
OKAY, YOU'RE DOING GOOD.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.259
YEAH, RIGHT.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.661
I REMEMBER WHAT IT'S LIKE,
BUT FAMILY COMES FIRST.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.163
(Dr. Taylor)
I NEED YOU TO KEEP PUSHING.

00:29.197 --> 00:30.631
I CAN SEE HER HEAD.
[groaning]

00:30.664 --> 00:32.233
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
WE'RE DOING GOOD HERE.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.401
GET THIS.
THIS IS WHAT I WANTED.

00:33.434 --> 00:34.402
(Justine)
GROSS.

00:34.435 --> 00:35.203
YOU'RE CROWNING.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.770
ARE YOU GETTING--
GETTING THIS?

00:36.804 --> 00:40.308
(Justine)
KIND OF. WELL,
NOT THE ACTUAL VAGINA.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.443
IT'S YOUR BABY SISTER!

00:42.476 --> 00:44.212
(Justine)
IT'S MY MOTHER'S VAGINA.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.479
AAH!
FREEING THE SHOULDERS.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.248
AAH!

00:47.281 --> 00:49.550
OH!
[monitor beeping rapidly]

00:49.583 --> 00:51.285
GET THE NICU TEAM IN HERE.

00:51.319 --> 00:52.286
BABY'S HYPOXIC.

00:52.320 --> 00:52.986
(Justine)
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

00:53.020 --> 00:55.489
WHAT'S GOING ON?
I DON'T KNOW.

00:55.523 --> 00:58.626
MY BABY!
HOW'S MY BABY?

00:58.659 --> 01:00.228
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:00.261 --> 01:02.730
[overlapping chatter]

01:02.763 --> 01:05.166
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?

01:05.199 --> 01:07.268
(Justine)
I CAN'T TELL.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.470
(Abbey)
FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON!

01:09.503 --> 01:11.439
YOU NEED TO BACK UP.
TURN THAT OFF.

01:11.472 --> 01:12.473
SHE'S NOT RESPONDING.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.308
(Abbey)
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

01:14.342 --> 01:16.844
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY BABY?

01:16.877 --> 01:19.680
WHY DOESN'T SOMEONE
TALK TO ME?

01:19.713 --> 01:22.683
[Massive Attack's Teardrop]

01:22.716 --> 01:30.724
*

01:52.280 --> 01:54.748
CANCEL YOUR DINNER PLANS.

01:54.782 --> 01:58.586
SHORT ON MEDICAL HISTORY.
SHE'S ONLY EIGHT HOURS OLD.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.222
WHAT SHE'S NOT SHORT ON
IS DOCTORS.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.923
UNFORTUNATELY, NONE OF THEM

02:02.956 --> 02:04.792
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE
HER BREATHING PROBLEMS.

02:04.825 --> 02:05.659
IMMATURE LUNGS?

02:05.693 --> 02:08.662
FULL TERM, AND THEY
GAVE HER SURFACTANT.

02:08.696 --> 02:09.697
LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE FULLY DEVELOPED.

02:09.730 --> 02:12.833
I NEED YOU A MINUTE.

02:12.866 --> 02:15.436
SILENT READING TIME
TILL I GET BACK.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.672
MY NANNY CALLED.

02:18.706 --> 02:21.209
HER DAUGHTER HAS
A DANCE RECITAL TONIGHT.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.744
SHE CAN'T WORK LATE.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.879
AND I HAVE
A BOARD MEETING TONIGHT.

02:25.913 --> 02:26.880
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

02:26.914 --> 02:29.950
MY MOTHER CAN'T COME.
SHE HAS A COOKING CLASS.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.253
OH, YOU'VE REALLY
GOT A PROBLEM.

02:32.286 --> 02:35.189
IF ONLY THERE WERE SOME
MATURE ADULT IN MY LIFE

02:35.223 --> 02:37.258
WHO COULD PINCH HIT
IN EMERGENCIES LIKE THIS.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.559
LOVE TO,
BUT I'M CATCHING UP

02:38.592 --> 02:40.861
ON MY BACK ISSUES
OF NUDIST CIRCUS.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.363
YOU SHOULD SEE
WHAT THE FAT LADY'S GOT

02:42.396 --> 02:43.364
UNDER HER BIG TOP.

02:43.397 --> 02:44.798
ALL I NEED
IS A WARM BODY.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.600
SHE'LL BE ASLEEP
THE ENTIRE TIME.

02:46.634 --> 02:47.601
I GOT A SICK BABY HERE
WHO NEEDS ME.

02:47.635 --> 02:48.536
YOURS IS HEALTHY.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.471
YOU COULD DEAL WITH
YOUR TEAM BY PHONE.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.940
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE SOMETHING
EXTRA WHEN YOU GET HOME?

02:52.973 --> 02:54.642
I'M NOT BARGAINING SEX
FOR BABYSITTING.

02:54.675 --> 02:55.809
BESIDES, YOU OWE ME.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.445
FOR WHAT?
SEX.

02:57.478 --> 03:00.348
I STILL DON'T SEE
A FEMALE DOCTOR IN THAT ROOM.

03:00.381 --> 03:03.417
IT'S MAKING ME
VERY UNHAPPY.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.486
FINE. OUT OF THE GOODNESS
OF MY HEART,

03:05.519 --> 03:06.887
WHICH WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY,

03:06.920 --> 03:08.356
WHICH WILL MAKE YOU
DESIRE ME MORE,

03:08.389 --> 03:09.890
WHICH WILL
TURN INTO MORE SEX.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.494
BE AT MY PLACE AT 7:00.

03:17.465 --> 03:20.334
(Taub)
FROM THE FATHER CARD

03:20.368 --> 03:22.970
DID NOTE A HISTORY
OF ASTHMA.

03:23.003 --> 03:26.974
WHAT IF HER LUNG PROBLEMS
ARE NOT COMING FROM HER LUNGS?

03:27.007 --> 03:27.975
(Foreman)
HER HEART LOOKS FINE.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.344
HER LIVER ENZYMES
ARE ELEVATED.

03:30.378 --> 03:33.347
WHEN THE LIVER FAILS,
IT STOPS PRODUCING PROTEINS.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.716
SPECIFICALLY THE ONES
THAT KEEP YOUR PLASMA

03:35.749 --> 03:38.986
INSIDE YOUR BLOOD VESSELS
AND OUTSIDE YOUR LUNGS.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.021
FIX THE LIVER,
SHE'LL HAVE ENOUGH BREATH

03:41.054 --> 03:42.990
TO KEEP THE ENTIRE WARD
UP ALL NIGHT.

03:45.326 --> 03:48.996
FOREMAN, YOU NEED TO STAY
AFTER SCHOOL.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.338
I APPARENTLY NEED
TO APOLOGIZE.

03:57.371 --> 04:00.040
LAST WEEK, I SHOULD NOT
HAVE GONE OVER YOUR HEAD

04:00.073 --> 04:03.344
AND ALLOWED CHASE
TO HIRE A NEW TEAM MEMBER.

04:03.377 --> 04:06.380
SO GO HIRE SOMEONE WHO LIKED
THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY.

04:06.414 --> 04:09.783
DO YOU WANT ME
TO HIRE A WHITE GIRL?

04:09.817 --> 04:11.385
GO FIND A WOMAN,

04:11.419 --> 04:14.021
AND WIPE THAT SELF-SATISFIED
GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.323
(Foreman)
THIS'LL BE QUICK.

04:15.356 --> 04:16.724
I'VE BEEN INTERVIEWING
PEOPLE ALL WEEK.

04:16.757 --> 04:17.891
I HAVE IT NARROWED DOWN
TO TWO CANDIDATES.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.427
WELL, NARROW IT
DOWN TO ONE

04:19.460 --> 04:21.595
BEFORE CUDDY
STARTS WITHHOLDING SEX.

04:21.629 --> 04:25.032
UH, SHE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING
TO ME ABOUT THAT.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.468
I SAID, WIPE THE GRIN.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.005
[cartoon music]

04:32.039 --> 04:34.007
(House)
YEAH, SHE'S FINE.

04:34.041 --> 04:38.746
I CAN HEAR HER BREATHING
ON THE MONITOR.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.013
I JUST CHECKED.

04:40.047 --> 04:43.584
I'M CHECKING
EVERY TEN MINUTES.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.453
FINE. I'LL CHECK AGAIN.

04:45.486 --> 04:48.055
[baby breathing on monitor]

04:52.393 --> 04:56.029
OH, SHE'S SO CUTE
WHEN SHE'S ASLEEP.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.030
YOU SHOULD SEE THIS.

04:57.064 --> 05:01.869
SHE'S--SHE'S--SHE'S GOT
ONE HAND OVER HER HEAD.

05:01.902 --> 05:05.906
OKAY, WELL, YOU TAKE
AS LONG AS YOU NEED.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.947
I'M THIRSTY.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.650
YOUR MOMMY SAYS NO,
'CAUSE SHE'S MEAN.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.018
IF IT WAS UP TO ME...

05:51.051 --> 05:52.920
JUICE!

05:52.953 --> 05:54.655
NO.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.690
GO BACK TO BED.

06:04.064 --> 06:08.101
I SAID BED!

06:08.135 --> 06:10.137
[dialing phone number]

06:12.139 --> 06:16.410
WILSON, HEY.
YOU UP FOR A BOYS' NIGHT IN?

06:16.444 --> 06:20.013
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
BREATHING PROBLEMS

06:20.047 --> 06:22.115
CAN BE CAUSED
BY A LIVER PROBLEM.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.851
(Abbey)
THEN WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HER LIVER?

06:23.884 --> 06:25.085
(Taub)
PROBABLY AN ABSCESS.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.721
IF WE FIND IT
WITH THE ULTRASOUND,

06:27.755 --> 06:29.189
WE CAN DRAIN IT,
MAKE HER BETTER.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.626
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE HER HOME
BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.762
IS SHE BLEEDING?

06:34.795 --> 06:36.063
SHE'S OOZING
FROM HER IV SITE.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.565
IT'S A SYMPTOM
OF LIVER FAILURE.

06:37.598 --> 06:38.866
IT'S WHAT WE WOULD
EXPECT TO SEE.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.168
DR. CHENG, WE MIGHT NEED
A UNIT OF BLOOD OVER HERE.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.103
(Taub)
ECHOGENIC AREA
IN THE LIVER.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.171
CAN YOU MAKE IT OUT?

06:44.204 --> 06:45.105
DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE
THE THICK WALLS

06:45.138 --> 06:46.974
YOU'D EXPECT
FROM AN ABSCESS.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.108
LIFT HER LEFT SHOULDER
SO WE CAN GET A BETTER LOOK.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.778
OH, CAN I DO IT? I HAVEN'T
BEEN ABLE TO HOLD HER YET.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.046
UH, SHE'S HOOKED UP TO
TOO MANY TUBES AND IVs.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.848
CAN I AT LEAST
DONATE BLOOD?

06:54.882 --> 06:56.116
OF COURSE.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.117
WE'LL DRAW YOUR BLOOD
AND SEE IF YOU'RE A MATCH

06:57.150 --> 06:58.586
AS SOON AS WE'RE DONE HERE.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.955
THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT
AN ABSCESS.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.991
IT LOOKS LIKE
DILATED BILE DUCTS.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.026
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

07:06.059 --> 07:08.195
CAN I STILL
TAKE HER HOME SOON?

07:11.899 --> 07:13.200
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT THE LIVER.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.568
ON ULTRASOUND,
WE FOUND

07:14.602 --> 07:16.103
INTRAHEPATIC
DILATED BILE DUCTS.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.038
EXTRAHEPATIC DUCTS
WERE NORMAL.

07:18.071 --> 07:22.142
(House, sweetly)
ARE THERE ANY MASSES
CAUSING AN OBSTRUCTION?

07:22.175 --> 07:25.846
NO. ARE YOU OKAY?

07:25.879 --> 07:29.016
JUST TALKING
IN A SOOTHING VOICE.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.051
NOT FOR YOUR BENEFIT.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.186
WHY? IS IT
TURNING YOU ON?

07:33.220 --> 07:35.188
HOUSE, THERE'S SOMEONE
HERE I NEED YOU TO MEET.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.090
I JUST HIRED
DR. CHRISTINA FRASER.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.759
SHE'S A BOARD CERTIFIED--

07:38.792 --> 07:43.697
(House)
NICE TO MEET YOU.
YOU'RE FIRED.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.032
WHAT?

07:45.065 --> 07:46.634
(Foreman)
HOUSE, YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

07:46.667 --> 07:48.201
I'VE DONE MY DUE DILIGENCE.
SHE'S THE BEST THERE IS.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.202
WHAT DID I DO?

07:49.236 --> 07:50.704
(House)
YOU HAD THE MISFORTUNE

07:50.738 --> 07:53.574
TO BE THE LESSON
THAT FOREMAN IS LEARNING.

07:53.607 --> 07:54.742
THAT WHOOSHING SOUND

07:54.775 --> 07:57.077
IS THE AIR BEING
LET OUT OF HIS EGO.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.017
(Foreman)
YOU ARE SUCH AN ASS, HOUSE.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.185
YOU COULD HAVE MADE
THE SAME POINT

08:05.218 --> 08:06.820
WITHOUT CRUSHING THE HOPES
OF A YOUNG DOCTOR

08:06.854 --> 08:08.589
WHO WAS ACTUALLY EXCITED
TO HAVE THIS JOB.

08:08.622 --> 08:09.857
(House)
NO, I'M NOT SURE
I COULD HAVE.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.692
I THINK YOU GIVE ME
FAR TOO MUCH CREDIT.

08:11.725 --> 08:15.663
TAUB, IT'S YOUR TURN
TO FIND A YOUNG DOCTOR

08:15.696 --> 08:18.031
WHO'S ACTUALLY EXCITED
TO HAVE THIS JOB.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.266
(Taub)
FOR YOU TO FIRE?

08:19.299 --> 08:21.234
NOT UNTIL YOU OR SHE
EARNS IT.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.303
DILATED BILE DUCTS
COULD BE CONGENITAL.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.238
THAT MEANS THAT IT'S A STRICTURE
IN THE DUCTS THEMSELVES.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.239
CAROLI'S SYNDROME.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.941
SO, OPEN HER UP.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.977
SURGERY?

08:30.010 --> 08:31.211
THIS IS A NEWBORN

08:31.244 --> 08:32.880
WITH LIVER FAILURE.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.815
SHE'S OOZING BLOOD
FROM EVERY PUNCTURE SITE.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.216
IT'S INSANELY RISKY
TO OPEN HER UP.

08:36.249 --> 08:39.186
(House)
YES. IT'S UNFORTUNATELY
ALSO THE ONLY WAY TO FIX HER.

08:39.219 --> 08:43.156
SO MAKE TEENY, TINY INCISIONS
WITH A REALLY SMALL SCALPEL.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.224
[doorbell rings]

08:44.257 --> 08:46.193
GOTTA GO.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.731
YOU TOLD ME YOU GAVE THEM
YOUR CREDIT CARD.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.633
AND YOU WERE DUMB ENOUGH
TO BELIEVE ME.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.770
CUDDY'LL BE BACK
IN AN HOUR AND TEN MINUTES.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.639
I'LL BE BACK
IN AN HOUR AND FIVE.

08:58.672 --> 09:01.308
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.309
OH, YES, I DO.

09:02.342 --> 09:03.811
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
LEAVE THE KID?

09:03.844 --> 09:05.245
YES, I AM,
'CAUSE UNLIKE YOU,

09:05.278 --> 09:06.246
I DON'T HAVE A CONSCIENCE.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.581
AND UNLIKE YOU,

09:07.615 --> 09:08.882
I'M NOT HAVING SEX
WITH CUDDY,

09:08.916 --> 09:11.218
SO I ACTUALLY CAN LEAVE.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.686
YOU'RE BLUFFING.

09:12.720 --> 09:13.687
I'M LEAVING.

09:13.721 --> 09:15.989
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE
A TWO-YEAR-OLD UNATTENDED.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.091
TRUE.
I'M LEAVING HER WITH YOU.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.594
A RESPONSIBLE ADULT.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.135
BETTER GET
BACK IN THERE.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.070
KID'S ALL ALONE.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.238
IT'S KIND OF BUGGING YOU,
ISN'T IT?

09:31.271 --> 09:32.239
NOT MY PROBLEM.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.774
WELL, SINCE,
OBJECTIVELY,

09:33.807 --> 09:35.676
YOU CARE MORE ABOUT LEAVING
A CHILD ALONE THAN I DO,

09:35.709 --> 09:36.476
IT KIND OF IS.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.045
OBJECTIVELY,
SINCE I NEVER ACCEPTED

09:38.078 --> 09:39.079
THIS RESPONSIBILITY,

09:39.112 --> 09:40.013
IT KIND OF ISN'T.

09:40.047 --> 09:44.117
TRUE, AND YET IT IS.
BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU.

09:44.151 --> 09:46.186
[engine starts]

09:46.219 --> 09:48.622
I'M LEAVING.

09:48.656 --> 09:49.690
I'M LEAVING.

09:49.723 --> 09:54.261
[both gunning their engines]

09:54.294 --> 09:57.631
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE.
YOU CAN'T.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.073
FINE.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.407
YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.009
YOU KNOW WHAT I CAN DO?

10:09.042 --> 10:10.711
I CAN GO IN THERE AND CALL
A BABYSITTING SERVICE

10:10.744 --> 10:12.780
FOR 15 BUCKS AN HOUR,
THEN CALL CUDDY

10:12.813 --> 10:16.283
AND TELL HER WHO'S
WATCHING HER KID AND WHY.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.221
I'LL STAY IF YOU STAY.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.232
WE WERE GONE TWO MINUTES.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.436
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE,
SWEETIE?

10:36.469 --> 10:39.339
COME ON NOW,
SPIT IT OUT.

10:41.374 --> 10:44.111
COME ON, SWEETIE. OPEN.

10:44.144 --> 10:49.382
BAH-BAH-BAH-BAH-BAH-BAH.
BAH BAH BAH!

10:49.416 --> 10:51.018
OPEN.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.385
OH!

10:54.121 --> 10:55.923
OW!

11:03.030 --> 11:04.164
[sighs]

11:04.197 --> 11:10.337
RACHEL, HOW MANY COINS
DID YOU EAT?

11:27.254 --> 11:29.156
ISOLATING
THE COMMON BILE DUCT.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.191
AND MOBILIZING THE DISTAL END
FOR CANNULATION.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.359
[monitor beeping rapidly]

11:32.392 --> 11:33.460
BP IS DOWN TO 50 SYSTOLIC.

11:33.493 --> 11:34.461
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP
THE CANNULATION.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.163
I HAVEN'T STARTED YET.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.197
(Cheng)
HIT HER WITH A BOLUS
OF PHENYLEPHRINE.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.098
THAT SHOULD BUY US
ENOUGH TIME

11:38.131 --> 11:39.833
TO GET IN AND DILATE
THOSE BILE DUCTS.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.870
(Foreman)
BP IS RISING. 70 SYSTOLIC.

11:42.903 --> 11:46.339
NICE. I'M IN
THE COMMON BILE DUCT.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.008
ADVANCING PAST
THE CYSTIC DUCT.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.509
NO STRICTURES
OR BLOCKAGES SO FAR.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.744
(Foreman)
BP IS DROPPING AGAIN.

11:50.778 --> 11:51.812
ANOTHER BOLUS
OF PHENYLEPHRINE.

11:51.845 --> 11:52.679
(Cheng)
SHE CAN'T TAKE MORE.

11:52.712 --> 11:53.981
THE FIRST BOLUS
IS STILL IN EFFECT.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.182
BP IS STILL DROPPING.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.850
WE'VE GOT TO PULL OUT.
WE'RE DONE.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.085
I WAS BARELY IN.

11:58.118 --> 12:01.088
THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.522
THE LIVER PROBLEM ALONE

12:02.555 --> 12:04.291
IS NOT GONNA MESS
WITH THE BABY'S BP.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.093
WHATEVER THIS IS, IT'S GOT
TO BE AFFECTING HER HEART.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.094
HEART PLUS THE LIVER.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.428
COULD BE
TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.263
OR IT COULD BE
A VASCULAR MALFORMATION

12:10.297 --> 12:12.265
IN THE LIVER,
CAUSING BOTH PROBLEMS.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.067
SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
OF DR. CHENG?

12:14.101 --> 12:16.937
BEST TREATMENT FOR A VASCULAR
MALFORMATION IS SURGERY.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.171
AND I THINK
YOUR WIFE THINKS

12:18.205 --> 12:20.007
YOU SHOULDN'T THINK
ANYTHING OF DR. CHENG.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.008
NO SURGERY.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.109
A NEWBORN BABY
CAN'T HANDLE

12:22.142 --> 12:23.310
ANOTHER TRIP
TO THE O.R.

12:23.343 --> 12:24.444
I DIDN'T MEAN THINK THINK.

12:24.477 --> 12:29.049
I MEANT THINK
AS A POTENTIAL HIRE.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.151
WHAT IF WE STARTED
THE BABY ON STEROIDS

12:31.184 --> 12:33.553
AN ANTI-ANGIOGENESIS AGENT,
AND DOPAMINE?

12:33.586 --> 12:35.555
COULD WORK
JUST AS WELL AS SURGERY.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.858
SNAP THOSE
BAD BLOOD VESSELS SHUT.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.426
I'LL CALL HOUSE
TO GET APPROVAL.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.494
SO, WHAT WAS THAT SHRUG?

12:41.528 --> 12:43.463
A "DR. CHENG
COULD WORK" SHRUG?

12:43.496 --> 12:45.132
OR A "HOUSE
IS GONNA CRUSH YOU

12:45.165 --> 12:48.001
FOR EVEN CONSIDERING HER"
SHRUG?

12:48.035 --> 12:49.402
YOU SUCK.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.138
HOUSE IS GONNA HATE
ANYONE WE HIRE,

12:51.171 --> 12:53.140
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
WANT TO HIRE ANYONE.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.307
SO YOU THINK
I SHOULD ABSTAIN?

12:54.341 --> 12:56.076
JUST GIVE THE DECISION
BACK TO HIM?

12:56.109 --> 12:58.311
THEN HE'LL JUST MOCK YOU
FOR BEING A WUSS.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.180
YOU'RE SCREWED.

13:00.213 --> 13:04.952
UNLESS HOUSE FEELS LIKE
HIRING HER IS HIS IDEA.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.120
(Foreman)
STILL NOT ANSWERING.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.922
WE SHOULD JUST
START THE TREATMENT.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.862
SHE OPENED UP
A CHINESE FOOD BAG

13:14.895 --> 13:16.196
TO EAT MONEY.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.397
WHAT AN IDIOT.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.532
OKAY, YOU ORDERED
THE MOO SHOO PORK

13:19.566 --> 13:21.368
AND THE ORANGE CASHEW
CHICKEN, RIGHT?

13:21.401 --> 13:22.402
LIKE I ALWAYS ORDER.

13:22.435 --> 13:23.837
DID YOU CLEAN UP
IN THERE?

13:23.871 --> 13:25.072
YEAH.
IT'S GOOD ENOUGH.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.974
OKAY, SO WITH TAX,

13:27.007 --> 13:29.409
THE CHANGE SHOULD
HAVE BEEN 68 CENTS.

13:29.442 --> 13:32.279
THERE'S ONLY
58 CENTS OUT THERE.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.413
THERE'S A DIME MISSING.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.349
WELL, HE COULD HAVE
SHORTCHANGED YOU.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.251
FRIDGE MAGNET'S
NOT GETTING ANYTHING.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.287
(Wilson)
THAT'S BECAUSE
IT'S A FRIDGE MAGNET,

13:40.320 --> 13:41.855
AND UNLESS SHE SWALLOWED
A CANADIAN DIME,

13:41.889 --> 13:42.856
IT'S NOT MAGNETIC.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.424
REALLY?

13:44.457 --> 13:46.994
I MEAN, KIDS SWALLOW THINGS
ALL THE TIME, RIGHT?

13:47.027 --> 13:49.029
I MEAN, SHE SWALLOWED A DIME,
SHE POOPS IT OUT.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.397
SHE'LL BE FINE.
ABSOLUTELY.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.398
UNLESS IT GETS STUCK
IN HER INTESTINE

13:51.431 --> 13:53.333
AND CAUSES A BLOCKAGE,
WHICH COULD KILL HER.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.567
[door opens]

13:54.601 --> 13:56.269
THEN SHE WON'T BE FINE.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.105
YOU HAVE TO TELL CUDDY.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.040
WELL, THEN I WON'T BE FINE.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.274
IF YOU DON'T TELL CUDDY,

14:01.308 --> 14:03.276
I WILL GO OUT THERE
AND TELL HER MYSELF.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.212
YEAH? WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA TELL HER?

14:05.245 --> 14:07.380
ARE YOU GONNA TELL HER
THAT YOU LEFT COINS OUT

14:07.414 --> 14:09.249
AND YOU LEFT HER CHILD
UNSUPERVISED?

14:09.282 --> 14:12.920
HEY, HEY, HEY! YOU ARE NOT
GONNA PIN THIS ON ME!

14:14.687 --> 14:17.157
RACHEL NEEDS TO BE
MONITORED FOR 24 HOURS

14:17.190 --> 14:18.125
TO SEE
THAT THE DIME PASSES.

14:18.158 --> 14:21.294
YOU KNOW, JUST TO MAKE SURE
SHE DOESN'T DIE.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.663
YOU'RE TELLING ME
TO DO THE RIGHT THING

14:23.696 --> 14:25.332
WHILE CLIMBING OUT
A WINDOW?

14:25.365 --> 14:27.567
SHH SHH SHH SHH SHH!

14:29.970 --> 14:31.204
TELL HER!

14:39.312 --> 14:42.382
(Cuddy)
DID SHE WAKE UP AT ALL?

14:42.415 --> 14:43.583
ONE TIME.

14:43.616 --> 14:47.654
THAT'S NOT LIKE HER.
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

14:47.687 --> 14:50.157
SHE'S FINE.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.295
HOW ABOUT
I STAY THE NIGHT?

14:55.328 --> 14:57.364
THEN YOU CAN
REALLY THANK ME.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.399
I HAVE TO GET UP EARLY.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.467
WON'T BE ABLE TO SLEEP IN.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.936
I'M A DEEP SLEEPER.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.049
(Taub)
ROUND TWO.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.050
DID JUSTINE GO HOME?

15:17.084 --> 15:19.386
SAID SHE WAS GOING DOWNSTAIRS
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.421
A FEW HOURS AGO.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.490
SO YOU TWO ARE CLOSE?

15:23.523 --> 15:25.658
WELL, IT'S BEEN
GETTING BETTER ACTUALLY.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.627
AT LEAST SHE'S HERE
IN THE BUILDING.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.496
THAT'S PRETTY SUPPORTIVE
FOR HER.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.599
WHAT IS IT?

15:33.566 --> 15:34.534
SHE'S PINKER.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.336
IS THAT BAD?

15:36.369 --> 15:39.039
THAT'S GOOD.

15:40.140 --> 15:43.576
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

15:43.610 --> 15:44.711
[baby cries]

15:44.744 --> 15:46.246
WAS THAT HER?

15:46.279 --> 15:48.448
[baby cooing]

15:51.418 --> 15:54.454
CAN I HOLD HER?

15:54.487 --> 15:57.657
I THINK IT'S LONG OVERDUE.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.027
(Abbey)
OH!

16:01.661 --> 16:03.596
[gasps]

16:03.630 --> 16:05.432
OH.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.768
MY FIRST TIME.
FINALLY.

16:08.801 --> 16:12.205
(Justine)
TECHNICALLY,
IT'S YOUR SECOND TIME.

16:13.340 --> 16:14.307
I DIDN'T MEAN--

16:14.341 --> 16:16.343
I KNOW, MOM.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.613
MMM.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.460
LOOKS LIKE IT WAS
A VASCULAR MALFORMATION.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.494
THE GROGAN BABY
IS BETTER.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.031
OKAY, READY, HONEY.

16:38.065 --> 16:41.201
SO STAY VERY, VERY STILL
AND HOLD YOUR BREATH.

16:41.234 --> 16:44.137
DON'T MOVE.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.773
SHE MOVED.
THEY ALWAYS MOVE.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.610
IT IS A GOOD JOB.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.445
DIAGNOSTICS.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.214
SOLVE A MYSTERY,
SAVE A LIFE.

16:54.247 --> 16:57.550
BUT I SUPPOSE YOU'RE
PRETTY ATTACHED TO PEDIATRICS?

16:57.584 --> 16:59.152
I'M SORRY, MS. YOUNG,

16:59.186 --> 17:01.354
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO RESTRAIN YOUR DAUGHTER.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.722
NOW THE MOM'S
NOT GONNA WANT TO DO IT

17:02.755 --> 17:03.556
BECAUSE SHE'D RATHER
I JUST KEEP

17:03.590 --> 17:05.392
BLASTING HER DAUGHTER
WITH RADIATION.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.062
YOU'RE TELLING ME

17:09.096 --> 17:10.663
THERE'S AN OPENING
IN HOUSE'S DEPARTMENT?

17:10.697 --> 17:13.066
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED?

17:13.100 --> 17:15.402
NO MORE KIDS,
NO MORE PARENTS.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.404
ONE CASE AT A TIME
INSTEAD OF 17?

17:17.437 --> 17:18.838
SET UP THE INTERVIEW.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.741
IT'S POSSIBLE YOU WON'T
NEED TO INTERVIEW.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.286
[Rachel grunts]

17:33.320 --> 17:34.754
[sighs]

17:34.787 --> 17:36.689
RELAX, I GOT THIS.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.525
OH, THANKS.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.134
PFFT!

18:01.514 --> 18:04.384
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

18:04.417 --> 18:08.621
YEAH, SORRY,
I'M JUST NEW TO ALL THIS.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.211
YOU WANT ME
TO RESET THE ALARM?

18:31.244 --> 18:33.246
GOD, NO.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.614
CASE IS UNDER CONTROL.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.816
I'M SLEEPING IN.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.452
YOUR BOSS MUST
REALLY LIKE YOU.

18:39.486 --> 18:40.487
[kiss]

18:43.556 --> 18:46.426
(Cuddy)
HEY, MARINA.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.794
PASTA'S IN THE FRIDGE
FOR LUNCH.

18:47.827 --> 18:51.598
[phone ringing]

18:52.799 --> 18:55.402
I ASSUME, SINCE YOU'RE
CALLING SO EARLY,

18:55.435 --> 18:57.437
THAT THE SURGERY
WAS A ROUSING SUCCESS.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.372
(Foreman)
AND I ASSUME,
SINCE YOU STILL THINK

18:59.406 --> 19:00.740
WE ACTUALLY DID
THE SURGERY,

19:00.773 --> 19:01.741
YOU HAVEN'T CHECKED
YOUR MESSAGES IN EIGHT HOURS.

19:01.774 --> 19:02.942
WHERE ARE YOU?

19:02.975 --> 19:05.178
(House)
I BELIEVE THIS IS
WHAT YOUR PEOPLE TERM

19:05.212 --> 19:06.246
A POOPIE CALL.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.215
UH, THE WORD IS BOOTY.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.216
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

19:09.249 --> 19:10.116
BUT THIS IS A POOPIE CALL.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.219
(Taub)
IT'S NOT CAROLI'S SYNDROME.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.420
DR. CHENG SPOTTED A--

19:13.453 --> 19:14.854
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHAT?

19:14.887 --> 19:17.390
I KNOW ABOUT THE JEW,
THE BLACK, AND THE CROC HUNTER,

19:17.424 --> 19:19.292
BUT WHEN DID WE GET
OUR ASIAN PERSUASION ON?

19:19.326 --> 19:22.262
DR. CHENG IS THE NICU
ATTENDING ON THE CASE.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.396
AND SHE'S NOT HERE.

19:23.430 --> 19:26.833
WELL, THEN I JUST WASTED
A PERFECTLY GOOD RACIAL EPITHET.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.636
SHE SPOTTED
A VASCULAR MALFORMATION

19:29.669 --> 19:30.637
IN THE BABY'S LIVER.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.804
(House)
GOOD CALL.

19:31.838 --> 19:32.972
EXCEPT FOR EVERYTHING
YOU JUST SAID.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.641
THERE'S NO WAY
THAT OUR PATIENT

19:34.674 --> 19:35.908
HAS A VASCULAR
MALFORMATION.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.410
(Chase)
AND YOU CAN TELL THAT

19:37.444 --> 19:38.411
FROM THE VAST AMOUNT
OF INFORMATION

19:38.445 --> 19:40.447
YOU'VE GLEANED
FROM NOT BEING HERE?

19:40.480 --> 19:41.748
(House)
DON'T NEED TO BE THERE
TO REMEMBER

19:41.781 --> 19:42.749
THAT THE PATIENT'S A.L.T.s

19:42.782 --> 19:43.983
WERE THREE TIMES NORMAL.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.885
THE BABY'S LIVER DAMAGE
IS FAR TOO EXTENSIVE.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.520
DR. CHENG'S AN IDIOT.

19:47.554 --> 19:50.590
IN FAIRNESS, IT WASN'T
COMPLETELY HER IDEA.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.359
MORE OF A FOREMAN
KIND OF THING.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.294
(House)
WELL, THEN YOU'RE
AN EVEN BIGGER IDIOT

19:54.327 --> 19:55.295
FOR TRYING TO COVER
FOR HER.

19:55.328 --> 19:58.398
HOUSE, WE TREATED FOR
A VASCULAR MALFORMATION,

19:58.431 --> 19:59.699
AND SHE GOT BETTER.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.534
NO, SHE DIDN'T.

20:01.568 --> 20:05.272
CALL ME
WHEN SHE CRASHES AGAIN.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.707
THAT WENT WELL.

20:07.740 --> 20:11.878
[humming a lullaby]

20:14.046 --> 20:17.584
EVERYTHING OKAY?

20:17.617 --> 20:21.888
COME ON.
I KNOW THAT LOOK.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.991
I'M JUST NOT USED TO SEEING
SUCH EMOTION COMING FROM YOU.

20:25.024 --> 20:25.992
I JUST GAVE BIRTH.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.761
I'M, LIKE, ONE BIG VAT
OF HORMONES RIGHT NOW.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.530
(Justine)
IT'S NOT JUST
THE HORMONES, MOM.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.799
YOU'RE DIFFERENT WITH HER.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.967
IT'S OKAY.

20:35.001 --> 20:38.871
IT'S GOOD. IT'S JUST...

20:38.905 --> 20:40.807
I CAN'T HELP THINKING,
WHERE WAS THIS MOM

20:40.840 --> 20:42.875
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP?

20:42.909 --> 20:45.312
WOW.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.746
I NEVER REALIZED
YOU CONSIDERED ME

20:46.779 --> 20:47.947
SUCH A FAILURE
AS A MOTHER.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.282
(Justine)
I DON'T CONSIDER YOU

20:49.316 --> 20:50.283
A FAILURE.

20:50.317 --> 20:51.818
I JUST--

20:51.851 --> 20:53.286
[sighs]

20:53.320 --> 20:56.289
I NEVER KNEW THAT
THERE WAS AN ALTERNATIVE.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.596
HMM.
I THINK SHE FEELS WET.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.064
CAN YOU HOLD HER A SEC?

21:05.097 --> 21:06.866
I'M GONNA GRAB A DIAPER.

21:06.899 --> 21:10.337
OKAY.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.605
MOM, SOMETHING'S WRONG.

21:12.639 --> 21:16.609
OH! NURSE!
SHE'S BLEEDING AGAIN!

21:20.112 --> 21:22.349
ALL RIGHT,
SHE'S IN HER OFFICE.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.683
MOVE FAST.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.785
YOU SEE A DOUBLE-WIDE TUCHUS
COMING THIS WAY,

21:25.818 --> 21:27.987
YOU SCREAM LIKE A GIRL.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.322
IF RACHEL WAKES UP,

21:29.356 --> 21:30.690
SHE'S GONNA TELL CUDDY
EVERYTHING.

21:30.723 --> 21:31.958
SHE'S TWO.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.092
LAST NIGHT,
SHE WAS WHINING

21:33.125 --> 21:35.061
ABOUT THE GIANT MOOSE THAT
LIVES OUTSIDE HER WINDOW.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.496
MEDUSA AT 6:00.

21:36.529 --> 21:38.831
DON'T LOOK BACK.
MOVE, MOVE.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.982
HELLO.

22:01.521 --> 22:05.758
HELLO, I'M THE FRIENDLY MOOSE
WHO LIVES

22:05.792 --> 22:07.427
OUTSIDE YOUR BEDROOM.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.462
(House)
SHE HATES THAT MOOSE.

22:09.496 --> 22:10.663
HAND ME THE GEL.

22:12.064 --> 22:13.433
[cell phone rings]

22:13.466 --> 22:14.867
OKAY.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.504
MAKE IT SHORT.

22:17.537 --> 22:18.905
DO NOT PARDON THE PUN.

22:18.938 --> 22:22.642
(Taub, through static)
SHE'S CRASHING AGAIN.
WHERE ARE YOU?

22:22.675 --> 22:25.712
IS IT ACTUALLY IMPORTANT THAT
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAY?

22:25.745 --> 22:26.979
(Taub, through static)
WHAT?

22:27.013 --> 22:27.980
[beep]

22:34.787 --> 22:35.988
[line ringing]

22:36.022 --> 22:37.156
YEAH?

22:37.189 --> 22:38.758
(Taub)
THE BABY'S BLEEDING AGAIN.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.092
I'M SHOCKED.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.494
OH, NO, WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT'S YOU.

22:41.528 --> 22:42.495
(Taub)
YES.

22:42.529 --> 22:43.530
YOU'RE A GENIUS.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.698
THE BLEEDING MEANS HER LIVER
IS STILL FAILING.

22:45.732 --> 22:46.766
IT'S NOT A VASCULAR
MALFORMATION.

22:46.799 --> 22:48.668
HOUSE, COME TAKE
A LOOK AT THIS.

22:48.701 --> 22:49.936
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

22:49.969 --> 22:52.004
(Taub)
HOUSE, NO!
I NEED YOU!

22:52.038 --> 22:54.741
JUST PAST
THE ILEOCECAL VALVE.

22:54.774 --> 22:55.742
(House)
IT'S NOTHING.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.844
IT'S JUST
AN IRREGULARITY.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.579
IT'S A DIME.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.080
OR A POCKET OF AIR.

23:01.113 --> 23:03.015
YEAH,
WITH FDR's FACE ON IT.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.651
THAT'S NOT A FACE.
IT'S A SHADOW.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.786
HOUSE, THE THING
IS PERFECTLY ROUND.

23:06.819 --> 23:09.422
WELL, MOVE THE WAND
TO THE SIDE.

23:09.456 --> 23:10.723
TICKLES!

23:10.757 --> 23:13.125
THAT'S BECAUSE
I'M THE TICKLE MONSTER.

23:13.159 --> 23:14.861
[giggles]

23:14.894 --> 23:15.995
[cartoon voice]
GONNA TICKLE YOU
EVEN MORE!

23:16.028 --> 23:18.097
[regular voice]
LOOK AT--LOOK AT THAT.

23:18.130 --> 23:19.732
WE NEED AN X-RAY
TO BE SURE.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.668
GREAT, JUST GIVE HER

23:21.701 --> 23:23.436
AN UNNECESSARY DOSE
OF RADIATION.

23:23.470 --> 23:24.504
IT'S A DIME.

23:24.537 --> 23:26.072
[pounding on door]

23:26.105 --> 23:28.040
(Taub)
HOUSE, I KNOW
YOU'RE IN THERE.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.109
OPEN THE DOOR!

23:30.142 --> 23:33.480
[pounding]

23:36.716 --> 23:39.051
I SAW YOUR EXTENSION
ON THE CALL.

23:39.085 --> 23:39.986
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
DOWN HERE?

23:40.019 --> 23:43.055
UH, WILSON'S GOT
A TWO-YEAR-OLD WITH CANCER.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.658
SHE'S IN A LOT OF PAIN.
IT'S VERY SAD.

23:45.692 --> 23:48.160
[Rachel giggling]

23:48.194 --> 23:51.598
HE ALSO HAS AN OUTSTANDING
BEDSIDE MANNER.

23:51.631 --> 23:53.099
(Taub)
HER LIVER FAILURE
IS GETTING WORSE.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.034
YOU WERE RIGHT.
NOW WHAT?

23:56.936 --> 23:59.506
THE INTERESTING QUESTION
IS NOT WHY SHE'S WORSE NOW

23:59.539 --> 24:01.140
BUT WHY SHE GOT BETTER
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

24:01.173 --> 24:03.042
COULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING
WE DID THAT TEMPORARILY

24:03.075 --> 24:04.043
RELIEVED THE--

24:04.076 --> 24:05.044
WHAT'D YOU PUT HER ON
AGAIN?

24:05.077 --> 24:06.979
AFTER THE TRANSFUSION,
WE GAVE HER STEROIDS,

24:07.013 --> 24:08.848
DOPAMINE, AND THE ANTI--

24:08.881 --> 24:11.183
STEROIDS CAN TREAT
IDIOPATHIC HEPATIC FIBROSIS.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.085
IT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY SHE
GOT BETTER AND THEN WORSE.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.987
BUT NOT THE MULTIPLE
DILATED DUCTS.

24:15.021 --> 24:18.024
(Wilson)
HOUSE, I NEED YOU
BACK IN HERE!

24:19.091 --> 24:20.727
CANCER KID
TRUMPS LIVER KID.

24:20.760 --> 24:24.130
SORRY. CONFIDENTIALITY.
THERE ARE RULES, YOU KNOW.

24:26.566 --> 24:28.535
(Wilson)
THAT IS A DIME.

24:28.568 --> 24:29.902
(House)
IT LOOKS MOBILE.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.170
AND IT'S RIGHT IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE COLON.

24:31.203 --> 24:34.106
PRIME LOCATION
FOR POOPING OUT.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.075
WE'LL GIVE HER SOME LAXATIVES
TO HELP IT ON ITS WAY.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.911
(Wilson)
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE
SOMEONE'S GOING TO GET

24:38.945 --> 24:41.147
SOME YUMMY CHOCOLATE.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.148
[cartoon voice]
CHOCOLATE.

24:42.181 --> 24:43.583
YUM YUM YUM.

24:43.616 --> 24:47.687
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
A GREAT MOMMY ONE DAY.

24:50.089 --> 24:52.091
[Rachel giggles]

24:54.927 --> 24:55.995
THANKS FOR WAITING.

24:56.028 --> 24:57.830
HOOK THE MOM UP TO THE BABY.

24:57.864 --> 24:59.031
DIRECT BLOOD TRANSFUSION.

24:59.065 --> 25:00.533
AND WHAT ELSE?

25:00.567 --> 25:02.001
NOTHING ELSE.

25:08.708 --> 25:14.180
IT'S AMAZING.
SHE'S PINK AND HEALTHY AGAIN.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.850
MOTHER'S TOUCH.

25:17.884 --> 25:21.020
IT'S A MIRACLE.
THANK YOU.

25:21.053 --> 25:24.791
A BLOOD TRANSFUSION
ISN'T A CURE.

25:24.824 --> 25:26.559
OR A MIRACLE.

25:26.593 --> 25:30.597
THEN WHY DOES THE BABY
SEEM LIKE SHE'S CURED?

25:32.098 --> 25:35.101
I HAVE NO IDEA.

25:42.374 --> 25:45.812
OUR PATIENT CAN EITHER
GO THROUGH LIFE

25:45.845 --> 25:47.947
WITH THE WORLD'S LONGEST
UMBILICAL CORD,

25:47.980 --> 25:51.884
OR WE CAN DISCUSS THE
DIFFERENTIAL FOR MAGIC BLOOD.

25:57.857 --> 26:00.126
BABY'S O2 SATS
ARE HOLDING.

26:00.159 --> 26:02.061
EITHER YOU'RE DR. CHENG

26:02.094 --> 26:04.230
OR YOU'RE EARLY
FOR MY MANI-PEDI.

26:04.263 --> 26:05.798
I THOUGHT
HER EXPERTISE COULD--

26:05.832 --> 26:07.700
COULD TELL US THE O2 SATS.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.836
I HOPE YOU COME WITH
SOME ORIGINAL IDEAS.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.103
(Dr. Cheng)
EITHER THE MOM'S BLOOD

26:11.137 --> 26:12.204
IS SPECIAL,
WHICH WOULD MEAN

26:12.238 --> 26:13.673
IT'S TREATING
SOMETHING SPECIFIC,

26:13.706 --> 26:15.174
WHICH MEANS THE BABY
HAS A DISEASE.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.043
OR MOM'S BLOOD
IS JUST BLOOD,

26:17.076 --> 26:19.211
AND IT'S REPLACING SOMETHING
THE BABY IS MISSING,

26:19.245 --> 26:22.348
WHICH MEANS THE BABY HAS
A SIMPLE DEFICIENCY.

26:26.118 --> 26:27.954
GIVEN THE LIVER FAILURE,

26:27.987 --> 26:29.255
A DEFICIENCY
OF CLOTTING FACTORS,

26:29.288 --> 26:31.090
ENZYMES, OR VITAMINS
ARE THE MOST LIKELY.

26:31.123 --> 26:31.958
(Dr. Cheng)
SO LET'S FIND OUT.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.325
HOOK THE BABY UP
TO SOMEONE ELSE'S BLOOD

26:33.359 --> 26:34.961
AND SEE IF SHE GETS BETTER.

26:34.994 --> 26:36.095
FIND A DONOR.
(Taub)
I'M O NEGATIVE.

26:36.128 --> 26:37.697
UNIVERSAL DONOR.
[cell phone vibrating]

26:37.730 --> 26:38.865
HOOK YOURSELF UP.

26:38.898 --> 26:41.067
DR. CHENG, HOOK ME UP.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.736
WALK WITH ME.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.906
MY TEAM SEEMS TO HAVE
TAKEN A SHINE TO YOU.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.074
I LIKE THEM TOO.

26:48.107 --> 26:51.043
I ASSUME YOU'RE HANGING AROUND
BECAUSE YOU WANT A JOB.

26:51.077 --> 26:52.679
THAT WOULD BE
A FAIR ASSUMPTION.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.180
WELL, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO TEST YOU.

26:54.213 --> 26:57.416
LET'S SAY,
TWO-YEAR-OLD...

26:57.449 --> 27:00.052
SWALLOWED A COIN
20 HOURS AGO.

27:00.086 --> 27:01.287
SHE'S GONNA BE FINE,
RIGHT?

27:01.320 --> 27:03.189
ANY SIGNS OF OBSTRUCTION?

27:03.222 --> 27:05.224
FOR THE PURPOSES
OF THIS QUIZ,

27:05.257 --> 27:07.927
LET'S SAY, NOT YET.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.328
I'D GIVE A LAXATIVE,

27:09.361 --> 27:11.097
ALTHOUGH I WOULDN'T
WAIT TOO LONG.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.865
HER BOWEL COULD
BECOME ISCHEMIC,

27:12.899 --> 27:14.233
OR WORSE,
AN INTUSSUSCEPTION.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.068
DEFINE "TOO LONG."

27:16.102 --> 27:17.770
ANOTHER SIX HOURS, MAX.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.105
BY THEN,
HER SYSTEM IS CLEAR.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.439
IF IT'S NOT OUT,
IT'S NOT COMING OUT.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.241
AND THEN WHAT DO I DO?

27:22.274 --> 27:24.310
I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU DO?
IT'S YOUR TEST.

27:24.343 --> 27:27.279
I'D GO IN WITH A SCOPE
AND GET IT.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.281
DID I PASS?

27:29.315 --> 27:32.318
IT'S NOT UP TO ME.
TALK TO TAUB.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.158
(House)
MEN'S ROOM?

27:39.191 --> 27:41.427
IT TURNS OUT, TOILETS
ARE HANDY IN THIS SITUATION,

27:41.460 --> 27:43.996
AND I FELT RELATIVELY SURE
THAT CUDDY WOULDN'T COME IN.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.164
OH, CUDDY'S BEEN IN HERE.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.934
SERIOUSLY?

27:47.967 --> 27:50.870
THIS MUST BE A TERRIBLE
PLACE TO HAVE SE--UHH!

27:50.903 --> 27:53.072
IS THERE SUCH A PLACE?

27:53.105 --> 27:54.841
OKAY, SIX MORE HOURS,

27:54.874 --> 27:56.208
THEN WE'RE GOING IN WITH A SCOPE
AND PULLING IT OUT.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.377
SCOPE A TWO-YEAR-OLD?
IT'S DANGEROUS.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.112
AND AS YOU
KEEP POINTING OUT,

28:00.146 --> 28:02.148
SO IS A DIME RIPPING
THROUGH HER INTESTINES.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.216
CUDDY WILL BE HOME
FROM WORK IN SIX HOURS.

28:04.250 --> 28:05.017
BUT NO BIG DEAL.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.185
I'LL JUST SCREAM,
"LOOK OVER THERE,"

28:06.218 --> 28:07.186
WHILE YOU QUICKLY
SHOVE A SCOPE

28:07.219 --> 28:08.788
UP HER DAUGHTER'S RECTUM.

28:08.821 --> 28:10.256
(House)
I COULD OFFER
TO BABY-SIT AGAIN,

28:10.289 --> 28:11.958
LET HER HAVE THE NIGHT OUT.
SURE.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.192
THAT WON'T RAISE
ANY SUSPICIONS.

28:14.961 --> 28:18.064
I WISH I WAS NICER.

28:18.097 --> 28:20.066
HEY.

28:20.099 --> 28:22.034
GIVE ME
YOUR RADIATION DOSIMETER.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.235
WHY?

28:23.269 --> 28:26.038
BECAUSE IT MATCHES MY EYES.

28:55.201 --> 28:58.137
I THINK WE CAN SAY
THIS ISN'T WORKING.

28:58.170 --> 28:59.305
WE'LL GET HER BACK
ON YOUR BLOOD.

28:59.338 --> 29:00.439
THAT'LL HELP FOR NOW.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.274
BUT THIS MEANS
THERE'S AN INFECTION.

29:02.308 --> 29:04.877
FIRST WE NEED TO
IDENTIFY IT.

29:04.911 --> 29:07.079
WE KNOW IT'S IN HER LIVER,
SO WE'LL GET A SAMPLE.

29:07.113 --> 29:08.080
THEN WE CAN FIGURE OUT

29:08.114 --> 29:11.283
HOW TO HELP HER
GET BETTER.

29:11.317 --> 29:12.284
I HAD THIS BABY

29:12.318 --> 29:16.956
BECAUSE I WANTED A CHANCE
TO BE A SPECIAL MOM.

29:16.989 --> 29:19.992
BUT NOT THIS WAY.

29:31.270 --> 29:34.373
PROBLEMS IN RADIOLOGY.

29:34.406 --> 29:38.244
A RADIATION DOSIMETER BADGE
TURNED POSITIVE.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.913
I COULD HAVE A CT SCANNER
THAT'S LEAKING

29:40.947 --> 29:43.515
OR A SPILLED VIAL
OF THALLIUM SOMEWHERE.

29:43.549 --> 29:45.284
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHOSE BADGE IT WAS.

29:45.317 --> 29:46.252
THE CODE WAS SCRATCHED OFF.

29:46.285 --> 29:49.455
THAT HAD TO BE INTENTIONAL.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.257
I MEAN, WHY WOULD ANYONE--
I DON'T KNOW.

29:51.290 --> 29:54.126
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
I'M GONNA NEED TO WORK LATE.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.896
I WAS ACTUALLY HOPING
THAT YOU COULD BABY-SIT.

29:56.929 --> 29:59.098
NO.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.132
PLEASE.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.133
TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW?

30:01.167 --> 30:02.134
PLEASE.

30:02.168 --> 30:04.303
I HAVE A LIFE, YOU KNOW.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.340
I WILL MAKE IT
WORTH YOUR WHILE.

30:10.076 --> 30:14.947
I AM NOT GOING TO BARGAIN
BABYSITTING FOR SEX.

30:15.948 --> 30:18.050
WHO THE HELL SAID THAT?

30:18.084 --> 30:19.218
OF COURSE I WILL.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.087
THANK YOU.

30:29.461 --> 30:33.299
OH, THAT THING'S
NEARLY AS BIG AS SHE IS.

30:33.332 --> 30:36.402
DON'T WORRY. I'VE DONE THIS
AT LEAST ONCE BEFORE.

30:43.175 --> 30:46.178
ADVANCE ANOTHER CENTIMETER
AND YOU'RE IN.

30:49.015 --> 30:51.483
OH, GOD, THAT LOOKS AWFUL.
IS THAT FROM THE INFECTION?

30:51.517 --> 30:56.155
NO. IT MEANS
WE WERE WRONG.

30:56.188 --> 30:59.191
IT'S A MELANOMA.

30:59.225 --> 31:01.560
YOU MEAN, LIKE SKIN CANCER?

31:01.593 --> 31:04.296
HOW WOULD SHE GET THAT?
SHE'S NEVER BEEN OUTSIDE.

31:04.330 --> 31:07.166
BUT YOU HAVE.

31:07.199 --> 31:10.970
YOU'RE SAYING
I GAVE MY BABY CANCER?

31:26.052 --> 31:29.555
(Taub)
I FOUND A MOLE UNDER THE NAIL
ON HER LEFT INDEX FINGER.

31:29.588 --> 31:31.991
THE BIOPSY REVEALED
IT'S MELANOMA.

31:33.659 --> 31:35.627
THAT'S IT?

31:35.661 --> 31:37.930
HOW COME NO ONE
GOT ME FOOD?

31:37.964 --> 31:39.431
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "THAT'S IT"?
THE WOMAN HAS MELANOMA.

31:39.465 --> 31:40.432
SHE COULD DIE IF WE DON'T--

31:40.466 --> 31:41.500
BORING.

31:41.533 --> 31:42.935
SINCE THE BABY
HAS THE MELANOMA,

31:42.969 --> 31:44.103
WE KIND OF ALREADY KNEW
THE MOM HAD IT.

31:44.136 --> 31:46.238
YES, BUT NOW WE KNOW
WHERE IT IS,

31:46.272 --> 31:48.941
SO WE CAN TREAT IT
MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY.

31:48.975 --> 31:50.042
(House)
GREAT. SO TREAT HER.

31:50.076 --> 31:51.543
ALSO BORING.

31:51.577 --> 31:54.713
WHAT'S INTERESTING
IS THAT MOM'S MELANOMA

31:54.746 --> 31:56.548
SPREAD TO THE BABY
IN UTERO,

31:56.582 --> 31:57.950
WHICH MEANS
IT'S METASTATIC,

31:57.984 --> 31:59.418
WHICH MEANS IT'S
LATE STAGE.

31:59.451 --> 32:01.954
HOW MANY PEOPLE WITH
A LATE STAGE MELANOMA

32:01.988 --> 32:05.024
ARE AS HEALTHY AS SHE IS?

32:05.057 --> 32:07.393
CLEARLY, SOMETHING'S
GOING ON IN MOM'S BLOOD

32:07.426 --> 32:09.295
THAT'S TREATING HER MELANOMA
AS WELL AS HER BABY'S.

32:09.328 --> 32:10.696
ANTIBODIES.

32:10.729 --> 32:11.730
IF HER IMMUNE SYSTEM
WAS FIGHTING THE MELANOMA,

32:11.763 --> 32:12.831
IT NEVER WOULD HAVE SPREAD.

32:12.864 --> 32:14.733
EXACTLY, WHICH MEANS
IT'S FIGHTING SOMETHING ELSE,

32:14.766 --> 32:15.601
AND THE MELANOMA CELLS

32:15.634 --> 32:17.603
ARE GETTING CAUGHT
IN THE CROSSFIRE.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.705
SO WHAT'S MOM'S IMMUNE SYSTEM
REALLY SHOOTING AT?

32:19.738 --> 32:22.441
SCLERODERMA CAN CAUSE
CANCER-FIGHTING ANTIBODIES.

32:22.474 --> 32:23.242
SO CAN CHURG STRAUSS,

32:23.275 --> 32:24.743
PRETTY MUCH
ANY AUTO-IMMUNE DISEASE.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.745
OR INFECTIONS
THAT CAUSE GRANULOMAS,

32:26.778 --> 32:28.147
TB, MYCOBACTERIA.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.348
(House)
SEE, DR. CHENG?

32:29.381 --> 32:30.682
THIS IS NOT BORING.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.218
START WITH AUTO-IMMUNE.

32:32.251 --> 32:34.020
GO TEST HER BLOOD.

32:34.053 --> 32:36.088
AND LEAVE YOUR FOOD.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.129
JUST A LITTLE PINCH.

32:43.162 --> 32:44.963
AH.

32:46.732 --> 32:51.203
SO, UH, I'M NOT ACTUALLY
MAKING HER BETTER.

32:51.237 --> 32:52.638
I'M MAKING HER SICK.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.073
YOU CAN'T BLAME YOURSELF.

32:54.106 --> 32:56.008
I ATE ALL THE RIGHT FOODS,

32:56.042 --> 32:58.044
I READ ALL THE BOOKS
AND THE STUDIES,

32:58.077 --> 33:01.013
AND I EVEN HIRED
A PRIVATE DETECTIVE

33:01.047 --> 33:04.050
TO RESEARCH
EACH SPERM DONOR.

33:04.083 --> 33:06.185
I JUST MISSED
ONE BIG THING.

33:06.218 --> 33:10.356
MY OWN CANCER.

33:10.389 --> 33:12.191
(Taub)
I'M ALL DONE HERE.

33:12.224 --> 33:14.060
WE'LL HAVE
THE RESULTS SOON.

33:14.093 --> 33:15.394
AND IF THAT'S
WHAT THIS IS?

33:15.427 --> 33:17.063
AN AUTO-IMMUNE DISEASE?

33:17.096 --> 33:18.364
(Taub)
TREATMENT'S FAIRLY SIMPLE.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.566
AND IF IT'S
SOMETHING ELSE?

33:22.834 --> 33:25.104
LET'S JUST TAKE THIS
ONE STEP AT A TIME.

33:27.739 --> 33:32.044
STOP BEATING YOURSELF UP.

33:38.817 --> 33:41.720
(Justine)
I'M SORRY, MOM.

33:41.753 --> 33:45.791
NOT JUST FOR THIS,
BUT FOR WHAT I SAID EARLIER.

33:45.824 --> 33:48.527
I WAS JEALOUS

33:48.560 --> 33:52.464
AND ANGRY,
AND I LASHED OUT.

33:52.498 --> 33:55.267
BUT YOU WERE
A GREAT MOM.

33:55.301 --> 33:58.370
YOU ARE A GREAT MOM.

34:00.839 --> 34:03.775
I DON'T DESERVE
SUCH A GOOD DAUGHTER.

34:13.385 --> 34:16.355
NEGATIVE
FOR SCLERODERMA.

34:16.388 --> 34:20.859
SO, WHAT DID HOUSE
WANT EARLIER?

34:20.892 --> 34:22.494
HE JUST GAVE ME
A LITTLE QUIZ

34:22.528 --> 34:23.862
AND SAID HE WAS OKAY
WITH HIRING ME,

34:23.895 --> 34:25.864
BUT THAT
IT WAS YOUR DECISION.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.599
NEGATIVE FOR
DERMATOMYOSITIS.

34:27.633 --> 34:29.868
HE'S JUST SAYING THAT
TO SET ME UP.

34:29.901 --> 34:32.271
SO YOU'RE NOT
OFFERING ME THE JOB?

34:32.304 --> 34:34.473
IF HE WANTS ME
TO OFFER YOU THE JOB,

34:34.506 --> 34:35.707
SOMETHING'S GOING ON.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.577
THAT WAS MY THINKING TOO.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.546
IT'S NOT LUPUS.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.448
THINGS WITH HOUSE ARE NEVER
AS SIMPLE AS THEY SEEM.

34:42.481 --> 34:43.882
TRUST ME, HE'S GOT
AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE,

34:43.915 --> 34:46.285
AND I'VE GOT TO FIGURE IT OUT
BEFORE I DO ANYTHING.

34:46.318 --> 34:48.554
OKAY.

34:48.587 --> 34:49.621
[sighs]

34:49.655 --> 34:50.856
MOM'S NEGATIVE
FOR CHURG STRAUSS.

34:50.889 --> 34:52.158
THIS ISN'T AUTO-IMMUNE.

34:52.191 --> 34:54.293
TIME TO SCAN HER
FOR INFECTIONS

34:54.326 --> 34:56.328
THAT COULD CAUSE
GRANULOMAS.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.768
THIRD POOP
IN THE LAST HALF HOUR.

35:02.801 --> 35:04.303
STILL NOTHING.

35:04.336 --> 35:05.671
(House)
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

35:05.704 --> 35:07.806
TIME'S UP.

35:07.839 --> 35:11.377
OPERATION VALKYRIE
IS NOW IN EFFECT.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.755
EITHER IT'S A TRAP OR IT'S NOT.
JUST HIRE HER.

35:23.789 --> 35:26.458
LUNGS CLEAR
FOR GRANULOMAS.

35:26.492 --> 35:27.693
YEAH, WHO CARES?

35:27.726 --> 35:30.929
DID YOU ENJOY THAT BEAR TRAP
SNAPPING ON YOUR LEG YESTERDAY?

35:30.962 --> 35:33.632
YOU REALIZE IT'S JUST
A METAPHORICAL TRAP?

35:33.665 --> 35:35.367
YOU'LL STILL HAVE
ALL YOUR LIMBS.

35:35.401 --> 35:39.171
FOURTH RIB ABOUT
THE MIDCLAVICULAR LINE.

35:39.205 --> 35:41.240
YOU'RE OVER-THINKING THIS.

35:41.273 --> 35:42.874
HOUSE FIRED MY PICK
SIGHT UNSEEN.

35:42.908 --> 35:44.910
HE WAS NEVER EVEN INTERESTED
IN CHASE'S PICK.

35:44.943 --> 35:47.446
HE WAS ONLY OBSESSED WITH
HOW SHE REFLECTED ON CHASE.

35:47.479 --> 35:50.416
DR. CHENG IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE
HE'S ACTUALLY RESPONDED TO.

35:50.449 --> 35:51.917
YOU WANTED HOUSE INVESTED.

35:51.950 --> 35:53.819
HE IS. HIRE HER.

35:53.852 --> 35:57.456
AND YOU THINK
I'M OVER-THINKING THIS?

35:57.489 --> 35:59.691
SHUT UP AND HIRE HER.

36:02.928 --> 36:04.296
LOOK.

36:06.332 --> 36:09.468
OAT CELL LUNG CANCER.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.270
SHE HAS TWO CANCERS?

36:12.271 --> 36:14.773
CANCER TREATING CANCER?

36:20.679 --> 36:22.548
(Taub)
YOU HAVE LUNG CANCER.

36:27.653 --> 36:29.755
I THOUGHT I HAD
SKIN CANCER.

36:29.788 --> 36:33.392
AS UNLIKELY AS IT SOUNDS,
YOU HAVE BOTH.

36:33.425 --> 36:36.528
ACTUALLY, THE LUNG CANCER
IS BASICALLY TREATING

36:36.562 --> 36:37.829
THE SKIN CANCER.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.631
IT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT
FEELING SICK

36:39.665 --> 36:41.533
AND WHY YOUR BLOOD'S
HELPING YOUR BABY.

36:41.567 --> 36:43.602
(Taub)
WE FOUND IT EARLY,
SO IT SHOULD BE TREATABLE.

36:43.635 --> 36:46.638
IN A WAY, YOUR DAUGHTER
SAVED YOUR LIFE.

36:46.672 --> 36:47.739
WE'LL GET YOU SET UP
FOR THE SURGERY

36:47.773 --> 36:48.874
AND START YOU ON CHEMO.

36:50.576 --> 36:52.478
WHAT ABOUT KAYLA?

36:52.511 --> 36:55.314
(Taub)
SHE'LL ONLY NEED
THE CHEMO.

36:55.347 --> 36:57.316
CAN'T YOU JUST KEEP
GIVING HER MY BLOOD?

36:57.349 --> 36:59.585
NOT ONCE WE CUT OUT
THE TUMOR.

36:59.618 --> 37:01.453
YOUR BODY WILL STOP
MAKING THE ANTIBODIES

37:01.487 --> 37:03.655
THAT ARE KEEPING
YOUR BABY HEALTHY.

37:03.689 --> 37:05.924
CAN YOU HOLD OFF
ON MY SURGERY?

37:05.957 --> 37:07.293
(Foreman)
OVER THE LAST DAY,

37:07.326 --> 37:09.761
YOUR BABY'S LIVER TUMORS
HAVE SHRUNK 15%.

37:09.795 --> 37:11.263
PROJECTING FORWARD,

37:11.297 --> 37:12.931
IT WOULD TAKE
EIGHT OR NINE DAYS

37:12.964 --> 37:14.600
TO COMPLETELY ERADICATE
HER CANCER CELLS.

37:14.633 --> 37:16.702
SO LET'S TAKE
THE EIGHT OR NINE DAYS--

37:16.735 --> 37:18.737
THE CANCER
PROBABLY WON'T SPREAD

37:18.770 --> 37:21.540
IN THE NEXT NINE DAYS,
BUT THERE ARE OTHER RISKS.

37:21.573 --> 37:24.476
CANCER THICKENS YOUR BLOOD,
WHICH COULD CAUSE CLOTS.

37:24.510 --> 37:27.513
WHAT ARE THE RISKS TO
PUTTING MY BABY ON CHEMO?

37:27.546 --> 37:31.950
IT COULD DAMAGE HER BRAIN
OR AFFECT HER DEVELOPMENT,

37:31.983 --> 37:33.652
BUT THESE RISKS ARE SMALL
COMPARED TO THE RISKS

37:33.685 --> 37:37.022
THAT YOU WOULD BE TAKING BY
LEAVING YOUR CANCERS UNTREATED.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.328
I WANT TO WAIT.
(Justine)
MOM.

37:42.361 --> 37:45.797
ARE YOU LISTENING?
THIS IS WAY TOO DANGEROUS.

37:45.831 --> 37:47.533
I'LL TAKE THE RISKS.

37:47.566 --> 37:49.468
I WANT WHAT'S BEST
FOR MY DAUGHTER.

37:49.501 --> 37:50.836
I'M YOUR DAUGHTER TOO.

37:50.869 --> 37:52.971
SHE'S A BABY.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.673
YOU'RE AN ADULT.
SO WHAT?

37:54.706 --> 37:57.309
I DON'T NEED MY MOM
ANYMORE?

37:57.343 --> 37:59.511
NO. YOU NEVER DID.

37:59.545 --> 38:00.946
'CAUSE I WASN'T THERE
FOR YOU.

38:00.979 --> 38:02.948
BUT LOOK AT YOU.
YOU TURNED OUT GREAT.

38:02.981 --> 38:04.483
OH, YOU DON'T KNOW
IF I'M GREAT.

38:04.516 --> 38:06.084
YOU DON'T KNOW ME AT ALL.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.487
AND I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
MARTYR YOURSELF

38:08.520 --> 38:10.556
FOR A TWO-DAY-OLD INFANT
JUST BECAUSE YOU FEEL GUILTY

38:10.589 --> 38:13.559
BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T
AROUND FOR ME.

38:14.860 --> 38:18.864
I'M NOT MARTYRING MYSELF.
IT'S NINE DAYS.

38:20.366 --> 38:23.669
LET'S HOLD OFF
ON THE SURGERY.

38:28.707 --> 38:30.876
YOU BROUGHT FOOD?

38:30.909 --> 38:33.579
THIS IS A MEDICAL PROCEDURE,
NOT A DINNER DATE.

38:33.612 --> 38:36.348
I'M AWARE THAT THIS
IS A DELICATE PROCEDURE.

38:36.382 --> 38:37.983
I'M ALSO AWARE
THAT MY HANDS ARE SHAKING

38:38.016 --> 38:40.819
FROM LOW BLOOD SUGAR 'CAUSE
I HAVEN'T EATEN ALL DAY.

38:40.852 --> 38:42.921
SO WHILE THIS
MAY SEEM INSENSITIVE,

38:42.954 --> 38:47.092
THIS CRUCIAL,
LIFESAVING MOO SHOO--

38:47.125 --> 38:49.761
WHERE ARE
MY EXTRA PANCAKES?

38:49.795 --> 38:51.663
DAMN IT, THEY FORGOT
THE EXTRA PANCAKES

38:51.697 --> 38:54.065
FOR MY MOO SHOO PORK.

38:54.099 --> 38:56.968
EVERY TIME THAT NEW GIRL
WITH THE BLUE STREAK IN HER HAIR

38:57.002 --> 39:00.872
ANSWERS THE PHONE,
THEY SCREW UP.

39:02.608 --> 39:04.510
WAS SHE THERE WHEN
YOU PICKED UP THE FOOD?

39:04.543 --> 39:05.744
YOU ORDERED EXTRA PANCAKES?

39:05.777 --> 39:08.780
HOW MUCH DID THEY COST?

39:13.619 --> 39:15.921
WHERE--
55 CENTS.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.823
AND THERE WERE TWO.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.559
SO THAT MEANS THE TOTAL
ON THE LAST BILL WAS--

39:20.592 --> 39:22.060
WAS--

39:22.093 --> 39:25.096
$18.42.
$18.42.

39:26.097 --> 39:28.734
RACHEL COULDN'T HAVE
EATEN A DIME

39:28.767 --> 39:31.770
BECAUSE THERE WAS
NO EXTRA DIME.

39:33.171 --> 39:35.006
YEAH.

39:37.476 --> 39:42.748
SO THE IMAGE THAT WE SAW
ON THE ULTRASOUND--

39:42.781 --> 39:44.483
WAS OBVIOUSLY JUST
A POCKET OF AIR,

39:44.516 --> 39:45.784
LIKE I SAID ALL ALONG.

39:45.817 --> 39:48.720
BUT YOU SAW
THE WORST CASE SCENARIO,

39:48.754 --> 39:51.990
LIKE EVERY IRRATIONAL,
WORRIED PARENT.

39:52.023 --> 39:54.826
YOU'D MAKE
A TERRIBLE MOMMY.

39:56.061 --> 39:59.431
WANT TO GIVE ME
SOME DUMPLINGS?

40:10.241 --> 40:13.612
MOM, I BROUGHT YOU SOME--

40:13.645 --> 40:15.681
MOM?

40:16.715 --> 40:18.550
MOM!

40:19.551 --> 40:22.053
MOM.

40:25.223 --> 40:29.194
WE NEED HELP IN HERE!
SOMEBODY HELP US!

40:32.731 --> 40:35.667
(Taub)
MASSIVE PULMONARY EMBOLISM.

40:35.701 --> 40:36.802
SHE DIED IN SECONDS.

40:36.835 --> 40:39.571
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED IF SHE
LET US REMOVE THE TUMOR.

40:39.605 --> 40:42.173
PROBABLY NOT.

40:42.207 --> 40:45.076
POSTMORTEM, WE WERE ABLE
TO HARVEST ALL OF HER BLOOD.

40:45.110 --> 40:48.079
IT'S ENOUGH
TO TREAT THE BABY.

40:48.113 --> 40:51.082
THAT'S SOMETHING.

40:51.116 --> 40:52.518
PRETTY AMAZING CASE.

40:52.551 --> 40:54.185
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

40:54.219 --> 40:57.489
I WAS GLAD FOR THE CHANCE
TO WORK IT WITH YOU.

40:57.523 --> 40:58.757
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT,

40:58.790 --> 41:03.995
AND I'D LIKE TO
FORMALLY OFFER YOU THE JOB.

41:05.897 --> 41:09.167
IT'S FUNNY, I WANTED TO
WORK ON HOUSE'S TEAM,

41:09.200 --> 41:11.102
UNTIL I STARTED
WORKING WITH HIS TEAM.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.838
YEAH, I KNOW. CHASE AND
FOREMAN CAN GET A LITTLE--

41:12.871 --> 41:15.106
ACTUALLY, IT'S YOU.

41:15.140 --> 41:18.276
I GET THAT HOUSE IS AN ASS,
BUT AT LEAST HE OWNS IT.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.177
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

41:19.210 --> 41:22.280
THIS WHOLE THING
WAS JUST A GAME TO HOUSE.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.215
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

41:24.249 --> 41:26.718
YOU'RE A GROWN MAN,
DR. TAUB.

41:26.752 --> 41:28.687
YOU CAN MAKE WHATEVER
CHOICES YOU WANT,

41:28.720 --> 41:30.922
AND INSTEAD OF HIRING ME
WHEN HE SAID YOU COULD,

41:30.956 --> 41:34.993
YOU CHOSE TO ACT LIKE
A PARANOID, SCARED LITTLE KID.

41:35.026 --> 41:38.530
I HATE KIDS.

41:38.564 --> 41:41.667
GOOD-BYE, DR. TAUB.

41:41.700 --> 41:46.572
* WE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT

41:46.605 --> 41:51.109
* THE DOOR THAT OPENS

41:51.142 --> 41:54.646
I'LL MAKE SURE
YOU NEVER FORGET HER

41:54.680 --> 41:57.683
AND WHAT SHE DID FOR YOU.

42:01.286 --> 42:05.624
SHE WAS JUST TRYING TO BE
THE BEST MOM IN THE WORLD.

42:08.827 --> 42:10.962
SHE WAS.

42:15.366 --> 42:16.568
[door slides open]

42:28.379 --> 42:32.684
[Rachel murmuring]

42:32.718 --> 42:34.285
[sighs]

42:34.319 --> 42:37.823
THIS ONE'S ALL YOURS.

42:37.856 --> 42:40.258
WHAT HAPPENED
TO HELPING OUT?

42:40.291 --> 42:42.293
I DID.

42:56.407 --> 42:58.610
[door opens]

43:00.278 --> 43:02.080
(Cuddy)
DID SOMEONE GO POOPIE?

43:02.113 --> 43:03.982
[Rachel giggles]

43:06.317 --> 43:07.819
WHAT?

43:07.853 --> 43:10.822
HOW DID YOU EAT A DIME?

43:10.856 --> 43:13.725
(Rachel)
HOUSE.
