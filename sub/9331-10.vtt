♪♪

00:05.086 --> 00:06.006
Previously
on Young and Hungry...

00:06.006 --> 00:07.178
In our last appointment,

00:07.178 --> 00:09.840
we talked about you
letting Gabi start dating.

00:09.840 --> 00:12.012
-How'd that go?
-I guess it went fine.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.305
Sofia, I'm not
dating anymore.

00:14.305 --> 00:16.097
Okay? I'm waiting
for Josh.

00:16.097 --> 00:17.978
He's my one in a million.

00:17.978 --> 00:20.271
A car skidded in the rain
and hit my dog.

00:20.271 --> 00:23.023
-I am sorry, I have to get
to the animal hospital.
-I'll take you.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.605
-How is he?
-He's gonna be just fine.

00:24.605 --> 00:26.107
Oh, thank god!

00:26.107 --> 00:28.699
(laughing)
Thank you so much
for being there for me.

00:36.247 --> 00:39.580
Hi! How awesome is it
that I get to work

00:39.580 --> 00:40.961
at the new,
fancy Soul Spin

00:40.961 --> 00:42.873
that just opened up
across the street?

00:42.873 --> 00:44.925
Now I get free lattes
all day long.

00:44.925 --> 00:46.837
Oh, wow, they have
free lattes there?

00:46.837 --> 00:48.509
Nope. Here, hit me!

00:49.880 --> 00:51.512
Hello?

00:51.512 --> 00:55.636
I'm sorry, I'm a little busy
doing my real job...

00:55.636 --> 00:58.139
getting ready to tell Josh
I am no longer dating.

00:58.139 --> 00:59.680
-I'm officially
waiting for him.
-(beeping)

00:59.680 --> 01:01.682
What? Gabi,
that's a horrible idea.

01:01.682 --> 01:03.354
He's the one
that told you
to start dating.

01:03.354 --> 01:05.856
Oh, please, his lips said,
"You should date,"

01:05.856 --> 01:09.450
but his cute little
puppy dog eyes said,
"Pwease wait!"

01:09.450 --> 01:13.073
Yeah, you can wait,
but don't tell him
you're waiting.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.116
It'll just freak him out
and put way too much
pressure on him.

01:15.116 --> 01:17.788
No, that's ridiculous.
If anything, he'll feel
less pressure.

01:17.788 --> 01:20.161
This way, he doesn't have to
worry about me meeting someone

01:20.161 --> 01:22.623
and not being there
when he's ready.

01:22.623 --> 01:25.256
This way, he can relax
in the warm security
of knowing

01:25.256 --> 01:29.009
I'm standing right outside
of his door waiting.

01:30.010 --> 01:31.922
Just waiting.

01:31.922 --> 01:34.094
Yeah, men love that.

01:35.266 --> 01:38.429
Gabi, remember that cute guy,
Max, that I met at Soul Spin?

01:38.429 --> 01:40.311
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, he asked me out tonight,

01:40.311 --> 01:41.562
and you wanna know why?

01:41.562 --> 01:43.394
Because I didn't
pressure him.

01:43.394 --> 01:46.607
When he asked me, I said,
"Cool," and just walked away.

01:47.938 --> 01:50.281
Didn't even give him
my phone number.

01:52.363 --> 01:53.494
How is he gonna text you

01:53.494 --> 01:54.695
to tell you
what you're gonna do

01:54.695 --> 01:56.327
or where
you're gonna meet?

01:57.198 --> 01:58.409
Oh, crap, I gotta go!

02:01.242 --> 02:03.914
Oh, my god!

02:03.914 --> 02:06.207
You just won
the Australian award

02:06.207 --> 02:11.051
for Digital Innovation
in Next Gen Optimization.

02:11.051 --> 02:12.633
A D.I.N.G.O.!

02:12.633 --> 02:14.595
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I got the email.

02:14.595 --> 02:17.178
Why aren't you
more excited?

02:17.178 --> 02:19.099
It's soops prestidge.

02:19.099 --> 02:20.891
They want you
in Sydney this weekend.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.643
They're paying
for everything,

02:22.643 --> 02:24.355
including
a presidential suite

02:24.355 --> 02:25.726
and first class tickets
for two!

02:25.726 --> 02:27.188
-Elliot--
-Of course I'll go with you!

02:28.649 --> 02:32.152
I've already found
tons of stuff for us
to do in Sydney.

02:32.152 --> 02:35.486
We can take a tour
of the opera house,

02:35.486 --> 02:38.699
we can spend the day
at Bondi Beach...

02:39.660 --> 02:42.373
we can explore
Hugh Jackman's outback,

02:42.373 --> 02:44.585
and if we're lucky,
his down undah.

02:46.417 --> 02:48.419
Hey... Elliot,
can you give us a minute?

02:48.419 --> 02:49.880
I need to talk to Alan.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.132
Fine. I'll go buy us
some sunnies!

02:52.132 --> 02:53.504
That's "sunglasses"
in Aussie.

02:53.504 --> 02:54.795
You're not
coming with me.

02:54.795 --> 02:56.387
Aw, bugger.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.562
-You got my message?
-Yes, and I'm way ahead of you.

03:01.562 --> 03:03.854
I need to undo
my redo of your office,

03:03.854 --> 03:06.307
so... I'm returning
your accent wall

03:06.307 --> 03:07.938
back to its hideous
burnt orange.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.940
That's not why I called.

03:12.022 --> 03:13.113
(exhales)

03:13.113 --> 03:14.445
I kissed my therapist.

03:14.445 --> 03:16.737
Oh, my god,
that is so wrong.

03:16.737 --> 03:18.279
I can't even listen to this.
Tell me everything.

03:20.781 --> 03:22.533
It was so crazy.
In the middle
of our session,

03:22.533 --> 03:25.416
Dr. Rounds got this phone call
that her dog was hit by a car,

03:25.416 --> 03:27.878
-and she was so freaked out--
-That's when you kissed her?

03:27.878 --> 03:31.422
No. She was so upset,
so I drove her to the vet.

03:31.422 --> 03:32.333
That's when
you kissed her?

03:32.333 --> 03:36.297
No. We found out that
her dog was gonna be okay,

03:36.297 --> 03:38.509
and that's when
she kissed me.

03:38.509 --> 03:41.512
Oh, my god, making out
with your therapist?

03:41.512 --> 03:42.723
This is so Prince of Tides.

03:44.435 --> 03:45.766
What?

03:45.766 --> 03:48.148
Streisand, Nolte, rent it.
Never mind, I own it.

03:49.810 --> 03:52.483
-You know you can never
tell Gabi about this.
-Oh, you think?

03:52.483 --> 03:54.565
-This would crush her.
-You think?

03:54.565 --> 03:57.778
Hey, don't be smart-alecky.
I'm trying to help.

03:57.778 --> 03:59.660
You can never
go back to that therapist.

03:59.660 --> 04:01.702
What? I can't start over
with someone new!

04:01.702 --> 04:03.203
I'll be in therapy forever.

04:03.203 --> 04:04.575
Thank god Gabi's not waiting.

04:04.575 --> 04:06.246
Alan, I could not handle
that pressure.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.789
-Hey, guys!
-And that's how
you play baseball, Alan!

04:09.790 --> 04:11.372
Ah.

04:11.372 --> 04:13.634
Hey, uh, Alan, can I talk
to Josh for a minute?

04:13.634 --> 04:15.756
Sure, sure, Gabi.
I'll make myself scarce.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.087
And a nosh.

04:19.219 --> 04:20.591
-Hi.
-Hey.

04:20.591 --> 04:21.972
I made you
your favorite breakfast,

04:21.972 --> 04:23.764
French toast stuffed
with strawberry cream cheese.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.436
-You wanna know why?
-Why?

04:25.436 --> 04:28.228
Because I made a really
big decision about us.

04:28.228 --> 04:30.150
-You did?
-Mm-hmm.

04:30.150 --> 04:32.353
Josh, I'm waiting.

04:34.355 --> 04:35.356
For...

04:36.357 --> 04:39.490
-For... you know...
-Me?

04:39.490 --> 04:41.452
Me? Gabi, no.
Tell me you're not
waiting for me.

04:41.452 --> 04:42.993
Please, tell me
you're not waiting for me.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.496
(laughs)

04:45.496 --> 04:47.958
No! No, I'm not
waiting for you.

04:47.958 --> 04:50.541
I'm waiting for...
um, a completely other person.

04:50.541 --> 04:53.874
A man. I am waiting
for a man who I am dating

04:53.874 --> 04:55.626
because I am not waiting.

04:55.626 --> 04:56.877
Knock, knock.
Who's there?
Your ego.

04:56.877 --> 04:58.419
You want some whipped cream
on your French toast?

04:59.590 --> 05:01.091
Okay, gotta go.

05:02.763 --> 05:05.686
(theme music playing)

05:08.308 --> 05:12.523
♪ She in the spotlight
and she turned my head ♪

05:12.523 --> 05:15.736
♪ She'd run a red light
'cause she's bad like that ♪

05:15.736 --> 05:19.109
♪ I like that
ooh, baby ooh, baby ♪

05:19.109 --> 05:20.150
♪ Baby ♪

05:20.150 --> 05:22.823
♪ I like that
ooh baby ooh baby ♪

05:23.824 --> 05:25.325
(knocking)

05:28.208 --> 05:29.950
-Josh.
-Hi, Dr. Rounds.

05:31.001 --> 05:32.082
Honestly, I didn't know

05:32.082 --> 05:33.253
if you were gonna show up

05:33.253 --> 05:34.455
for your session today.

05:34.455 --> 05:35.456
Yeah, neither did I.

05:35.456 --> 05:36.627
My friend told me not to,

05:36.627 --> 05:38.459
but I felt like we were
making some real progress

05:38.459 --> 05:41.922
before... "the whole thing
with the dog happened."

05:41.922 --> 05:42.963
How is he, by the way?

05:42.963 --> 05:45.596
He's doing okay, thanks.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.598
Josh, I just want to say
what happened the other night

05:47.598 --> 05:49.680
was unprofessional
and will never happen again.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.021
(exhales)

05:51.021 --> 05:54.935
Great, because there is a lot
going on in Joshland.

05:54.935 --> 05:57.237
Well, I'm committed
to helping you

05:57.237 --> 06:00.441
in the most ethical,
objective, and professional way.

06:01.442 --> 06:02.443
(exhales)

06:04.074 --> 06:07.327
So... how was your week?

06:07.327 --> 06:09.990
Well, um... I won an award.

06:09.990 --> 06:11.542
Yeah, I'm flying
to Sydney on Saturday.

06:11.542 --> 06:13.624
Congratulations.
You must be proud.

06:15.255 --> 06:16.997
I am.

06:16.997 --> 06:19.670
But, the thing is,
they gave me this plus one,

06:19.670 --> 06:21.552
and I'm like, "Dammit."

06:21.552 --> 06:23.303
You know, I wish I can
take Gabi, but I can't.

06:23.303 --> 06:25.005
I don't want to lead her on
and make her think that

06:25.005 --> 06:27.217
I'm ready to be with her
when I'm not.

06:27.217 --> 06:28.469
But I wanna be.

06:28.469 --> 06:30.641
She's dating a lot,
and what if I lose her?

06:30.641 --> 06:32.933
What if another guy
falls for her?

06:32.933 --> 06:36.146
She's so amazing
and beautiful and funny.

06:36.146 --> 06:37.478
Okay!

06:37.478 --> 06:39.900
We get it! You like Gabi!

06:41.482 --> 06:43.824
I apologize
for my outburst.

06:43.824 --> 06:45.365
(shakily)
Go on.

06:47.618 --> 06:48.699
Are you crying?

06:48.699 --> 06:51.371
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

06:51.371 --> 06:53.624
I thought I could be
professional, but I can't.

06:53.624 --> 06:56.537
I know I said that kiss
didn't mean anything,
but it did.

06:56.537 --> 06:58.459
I can't stop
thinking about it.

06:58.459 --> 06:59.960
Did it mean
anything to you?

06:59.960 --> 07:02.633
-Uh...
-Oh, god!

07:02.633 --> 07:04.635
This is so
not professional.

07:04.635 --> 07:07.257
You know what?
I'm gonna give you
the name of a therapist,

07:07.257 --> 07:10.140
and you can continue
your treatment with them

07:10.140 --> 07:13.604
and I'll just...
never see you again.

07:13.604 --> 07:15.355
Okay?
You okay with that?

07:16.647 --> 07:20.400
-Uh...
-You know what?
I am falling apart.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.523
You need to go, Josh.
Unless you wanna stay.

07:22.523 --> 07:24.865
No. No, no.
Go, go. Get out.

07:29.199 --> 07:33.834
Whoo! Those paint fumes
got me feelin' a little sexy.

07:33.834 --> 07:36.997
Come here my little--
Oop, now I'm nauseous.

07:36.997 --> 07:38.458
Do you have any bagels?

07:38.458 --> 07:40.340
How does roast pig sound?

07:40.340 --> 07:42.583
With my cholesterol?
Like suicide.

07:43.844 --> 07:46.587
I'm talking luau
in the backyard

07:46.587 --> 07:48.589
of our AirBnB
on the beach in Maui.

07:48.589 --> 07:50.350
I was thinking,

07:50.350 --> 07:52.012
since Josh is going to be
gone for a week,

07:52.012 --> 07:53.644
how about a little redo
of our honeymoon?

07:53.644 --> 07:57.688
Sweetie, I love that idea,
but I don't have a job.

07:57.688 --> 07:59.560
You know we can't afford
a rental with its own

07:59.560 --> 08:04.815
plunge pool and sweeping views
of a hopefully inactive volcano?

08:04.815 --> 08:06.607
Oh, god, we need
to find a way.

08:06.607 --> 08:08.909
All we need is a third
so we can go splitsies.

08:08.909 --> 08:10.701
But who do we know
who's all alone

08:10.701 --> 08:12.282
and could drop everything

08:12.282 --> 08:14.074
and make vacation plans
with no notice?

08:14.074 --> 08:15.706
Hey!

08:17.578 --> 08:19.249
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

08:19.249 --> 08:20.671
We're gonna be
on that beach
in no time.

08:20.671 --> 08:22.212
And I'm gonna be
on that beach

08:22.212 --> 08:23.624
till she says, "Yes."

08:25.215 --> 08:27.387
Yolanda!

08:29.680 --> 08:32.633
Gabi... look!
Max sent me flowers!

08:32.633 --> 08:34.394
Listen to this.
(clears throat)

08:34.394 --> 08:36.346
"Dear Sofia,
I'm sending you

08:36.346 --> 08:38.559
these flowers
for no reason."

08:40.851 --> 08:43.694
No one has ever
sent me "no reason"
flowers before.

08:43.694 --> 08:45.946
Aww, that's so sweet.

08:45.946 --> 08:47.698
Okay, my turn.

08:47.698 --> 08:49.199
So you were totally
right about Josh.

08:49.199 --> 08:51.612
I told him I was waiting
and he freaked out,

08:51.612 --> 08:54.034
so I told him I was
waiting for a date.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.456
-And guess what
I don't have? A date.
-Oh.

08:56.456 --> 08:57.578
(door opens)

08:57.578 --> 08:58.749
Hey, guys.

08:58.749 --> 08:59.870
Hey, Josh.

09:01.461 --> 09:03.964
Flowers, you ask?
Indeed they are.

09:03.964 --> 09:06.046
Sent to me by none other
than that guy I told you

09:06.046 --> 09:07.297
I was... dating.

09:07.297 --> 09:10.090
-Nice. Have you seen Alan?
-Oh, read you the card, you ask?

09:10.090 --> 09:11.221
Okay.

09:11.221 --> 09:13.053
"Dear Sof-- Gabi...

09:14.554 --> 09:16.727
I'm sending you
these flowers
for no reason."

09:16.727 --> 09:19.730
Oh, heck, I'm not gonna
bore you with the rest.

09:19.730 --> 09:24.104
The point is, I'm dating,
so no pressure for you.

09:24.104 --> 09:25.896
Great. Thanks.

09:25.896 --> 09:27.988
If you see Alan,
tell him I need him.

09:29.449 --> 09:31.992
So, uh... I made it clear
I'm dating, right?

09:31.992 --> 09:34.494
Or should I give
myself a hickey
with the vacuum cleaner?

09:38.368 --> 09:39.579
Gabi said
you needed me?

09:39.579 --> 09:40.871
Remember
how you told me

09:40.871 --> 09:42.502
not to go back
to my therapist?

09:42.502 --> 09:43.874
-I did.
-And?

09:43.874 --> 09:46.126
She told me she has
feelings for me.

09:46.126 --> 09:49.089
(gasps) Demon woman!
I'm gonna report her!

09:49.089 --> 09:51.091
No! No, no, no!
I don't want her
to lose her job.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.803
(gasps)
You like her!

09:52.803 --> 09:55.095
Prince of Tides!
Prince of Tides!

09:55.095 --> 09:57.057
I like Gabi.

09:57.057 --> 09:59.429
Gabi's the one I like.
Alan, this is hell.

09:59.429 --> 10:01.722
I can't go back to therapy,
so I can't get better for Gabi,

10:01.722 --> 10:04.064
but I can't tell Gabi
that I can't go back
'cause she'll ask why,

10:04.064 --> 10:06.146
and then I'll have to tell her
because I kissed my therapist,

10:06.146 --> 10:07.688
which you and I both
agreed I cannot do.

10:08.819 --> 10:10.320
(exhales)

10:10.320 --> 10:11.782
Alan, what are you doing?

10:11.782 --> 10:15.285
Wha-- Oh, my god,
that feels good.

10:15.285 --> 10:16.697
I know. My nana
used to do this

10:16.697 --> 10:18.999
every time I had to
do something sporty.

10:18.999 --> 10:21.041
Josh, listen to me.

10:21.041 --> 10:23.543
This trip to Australia
couldn't come at a better time.

10:23.543 --> 10:25.415
You need to get away,
clear your head,

10:25.415 --> 10:27.547
and come back
and find yourself
a new therapist.

10:27.547 --> 10:28.749
Might I suggest a man?

10:28.749 --> 10:31.301
No. I'm not seeing
any more therapists.

10:31.301 --> 10:32.883
I am officially
done with therapy.

10:32.883 --> 10:34.344
Yes!

10:34.344 --> 10:35.756
That worked fast!

10:39.810 --> 10:41.431
(ding)

10:41.431 --> 10:43.143
Oh, my god,
what took you so long?

10:43.143 --> 10:44.604
You texted me, like,
two minutes ago!

10:45.816 --> 10:48.068
-What are you doing?
-Well, I'm in the middle
of teaching a class.

10:48.068 --> 10:49.229
I have to keep
my heart rate up.

10:49.229 --> 10:51.111
It's fine. Just talk fast.
I turned the lights down

10:51.111 --> 10:52.733
and put on
an extended remix. Go!

10:52.733 --> 10:53.824
It worked, Sofia.
It worked!

10:53.824 --> 10:54.865
What worked?

10:54.865 --> 10:56.987
The me dating,
no pressure thing!

10:56.987 --> 10:59.369
It totally sealed
the deal with Josh!
He's done with therapy!

10:59.369 --> 11:01.832
Oh, my god,
that's so great!
I'm so happy for him!

11:01.832 --> 11:03.583
For him?
What about me?

11:03.583 --> 11:04.835
Don't you know
what this means?

11:04.835 --> 11:06.546
Well, I don't know.
Talk quick 'cause I only have

11:06.546 --> 11:07.958
a minute left
until we do arms.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.049
If he's done
with therapy,

11:09.049 --> 11:10.711
that means he's over
his commitment issues,

11:10.711 --> 11:12.462
which means he's ready
to be with me.

11:12.462 --> 11:15.846
-With me!
-Wow! He said all that?

11:15.846 --> 11:18.468
No, he didn't,
but he's about to,

11:18.468 --> 11:20.761
which is the other reason
I asked you to come up here.

11:20.761 --> 11:22.222
I need to borrow
your Poppin' Pink lip gloss.

11:22.222 --> 11:24.184
-I want our first kiss
back together to be poppin'.
-(ding)

11:24.184 --> 11:25.766
Okay!

11:25.766 --> 11:27.898
Well, I only have
15 seconds left.

11:27.898 --> 11:30.020
-Okay!
-You pop that lip gloss, girl!

11:30.020 --> 11:31.441
Do it, do it, do it!

11:31.441 --> 11:33.774
-Thank you! Bye!
-You look amazing! Bye!

11:38.779 --> 11:39.820
(chuckles)

11:39.820 --> 11:41.201
Alo-hey!

11:42.993 --> 11:45.916
I am so excited
about our trip to Hawaii!

11:45.916 --> 11:46.997
Thanks again
for inviting me.

11:46.997 --> 11:48.288
Oh, it's our pleasure.

11:48.288 --> 11:49.419
Just remember the rule:

11:49.419 --> 11:51.922
Bellinis, not bikinis.

11:54.174 --> 11:55.926
And you remember:

11:55.926 --> 11:58.258
cru-di-tay,
not nu-di-tay.

11:59.549 --> 12:01.601
Ooh, check out
all this stuff

12:01.601 --> 12:02.843
I got on my lunch break.

12:02.843 --> 12:04.684
A hat to keep
the sun out of my eyes

12:04.684 --> 12:06.226
while I'm on
the lido deck...

12:06.226 --> 12:07.477
(chuckles)

12:07.477 --> 12:09.649
and some Dramamine
for my seasickness.

12:09.649 --> 12:12.813
Yolanda, you know
we're flying to Hawaii, right?

12:12.813 --> 12:14.905
Flying?
No, no, no, no, no.

12:14.905 --> 12:16.236
No one said anything
about flying!

12:16.236 --> 12:17.948
We only have
a week off.

12:17.948 --> 12:19.569
If we took a boat,
by the time we got there,

12:19.569 --> 12:21.031
we'd have to
come right back.

12:21.031 --> 12:23.453
Oh. Heh, that makes sense.

12:23.453 --> 12:24.534
I'm out!

12:25.996 --> 12:27.998
You can't back out now!
We already booked the rental!

12:27.998 --> 12:29.960
I'm sorry,
I've never been
on a plane.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.171
And I'm never
gettin' on one.

12:31.171 --> 12:34.464
You do know
there's booze
on planes, right?

12:34.464 --> 12:37.137
You know where else
there's booze?

12:37.137 --> 12:38.378
In my purse!

12:39.469 --> 12:41.341
Right here
on the ground!

12:46.096 --> 12:48.558
Okay, so an acceptance speech
under two minutes

12:48.558 --> 12:50.190
and no kangaroo puns.

12:50.190 --> 12:51.982
But what if
I'm feeling jumpy?

12:51.982 --> 12:53.483
(laughs)
Hello?

12:56.356 --> 12:58.738
-Got your dinner.
-Oh, good.

13:01.071 --> 13:05.705
Okay, well, tonight's menu
features butternut squash soup.

13:05.705 --> 13:07.207
Don't spill it...

13:07.207 --> 13:08.368
unless you want to.

13:08.368 --> 13:10.000
Do you want to?
Spill it, I mean?

13:10.000 --> 13:12.833
Nope.
Too good to spill.

13:15.715 --> 13:19.880
Okay, well,
I'll just be... goin'.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.631
Headin' to the door to...

13:21.631 --> 13:23.263
leave, unless you...
wanna say something.

13:23.263 --> 13:25.305
No? Okay.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.517
All right,
I'm... leaving.

13:28.979 --> 13:30.390
Leaving.

13:31.431 --> 13:32.602
Left.

13:39.199 --> 13:41.571
You know what I thought
would be nice?

13:41.571 --> 13:42.822
A little dessert.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.075
So, I whipped you up
an apple tart tatin.

13:45.075 --> 13:46.867
-That looks delicious.
-You know what they say,

13:46.867 --> 13:49.499
an apple a day
keeps the doctor away.

13:49.499 --> 13:52.212
All kinds of doctors.

13:54.454 --> 13:56.006
Okay, well, bye-bye.

13:59.459 --> 14:01.461
(yawning)

14:04.054 --> 14:06.136
Coffee? Tea?
Pineapple sorbet?

14:06.136 --> 14:07.767
Gabi, why are you
still here?

14:07.767 --> 14:10.270
Just thought
you might have
something to tell me.

14:11.391 --> 14:14.854
Oh! Yeah! I do.
I completely forgot.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.857
-Finally!
-I'm flying to Sydney
tomorrow night.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.239
Oh, my god,
I have waited so...

14:19.239 --> 14:20.570
What?

14:20.570 --> 14:22.442
No, I already know that.

14:22.442 --> 14:25.195
I want new news.
New news! Just say it.

14:25.195 --> 14:26.987
I won an award?

14:26.987 --> 14:28.909
Oh, my god.

14:28.909 --> 14:30.991
Josh, what award?

14:30.991 --> 14:34.624
"The person who waited
the longest to tell Gabi
he's done with therapy" award?

14:34.624 --> 14:36.086
What?

14:36.086 --> 14:37.958
Where did you hear that?

14:37.958 --> 14:42.462
Um... I overheard you
talking with Alan.

14:42.462 --> 14:44.634
Why didn't you tell me?
I've been waiting all night.

14:44.634 --> 14:47.137
Why do you think
I just keep coming in here
like a crazy person?

14:47.137 --> 14:51.141
Do you think I just have
pineapple sorbet lying around?

14:51.141 --> 14:53.143
No, I've been
killing myself out there

14:53.143 --> 14:54.644
to get in here
so you can tell me

14:54.644 --> 14:56.686
that you're done with therapy
and you want to be together.

14:58.068 --> 14:59.359
So, are you ready
or... or not?

14:59.359 --> 15:03.113
-Uh...
-No uh's. I want words.

15:03.113 --> 15:07.077
-Gabi, it's complicated.
-Oh, not those words!

15:07.077 --> 15:08.989
Why is it so complicated?
Either you're done with therapy

15:08.989 --> 15:11.451
and you wanna
be together...
or you're not.

15:11.451 --> 15:14.034
I mean, what's so difficult?
Why can't you tell me?

15:16.796 --> 15:18.959
Gabi...

15:18.959 --> 15:20.750
I, um...

15:22.342 --> 15:24.044
I kissed my therapist.

15:30.810 --> 15:31.931
(sighs)

15:33.473 --> 15:35.815
Gabi... she kissed me.

15:35.815 --> 15:37.437
I didn't kiss her.
It meant nothing.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.020
Oh, really?
If it meant nothing,
then why didn't you tell me?

15:40.020 --> 15:43.523
-Because of this.
-Don't talk to me, okay?
Not one word.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.276
Did you kiss her back?

15:47.567 --> 15:49.739
-Gabi...
-I don't wanna hear it.

15:49.739 --> 15:51.621
Oh, my god...

15:51.621 --> 15:52.993
do you like her?

15:52.993 --> 15:54.124
No, I--

15:54.124 --> 15:57.037
Save it, okay?
I gotta get outta here.

15:57.037 --> 15:58.338
Gabi, wait.

15:58.338 --> 16:00.750
No, Josh.
All I've been doing
is waiting.

16:00.750 --> 16:01.791
Waiting for you
to be with me,

16:01.791 --> 16:03.503
waiting for you to be
finished with therapy,

16:03.503 --> 16:05.795
waiting for you to tell me
you're finished with therapy...

16:05.795 --> 16:07.587
Well, I'm not waiting anymore.

16:09.509 --> 16:11.971
Gabi, are you seriously
just gonna walk away?

16:11.971 --> 16:13.093
I never walked away
from you.

16:13.093 --> 16:14.764
Even after all the stuff
you put me through.

16:14.764 --> 16:16.806
Me? What
did I put you through?

16:16.806 --> 16:19.809
You dated Cooper
when I asked you not to.

16:19.809 --> 16:21.521
You kissed your therapist.

16:21.521 --> 16:23.233
You stood me up
on our first date

16:23.233 --> 16:24.314
and you flew
to Switzerland.

16:24.314 --> 16:27.277
You kissed your therapist!

16:27.277 --> 16:29.159
You kissed my brother!

16:29.159 --> 16:30.990
You kissed your therapist!

16:32.742 --> 16:34.284
And after all those things,
I forgave you.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.995
-You can't forgive me
for this one thing.
-(ding)

16:35.995 --> 16:38.668
No. We're done.

16:38.668 --> 16:39.879
-Gabi--
-Done!

16:42.882 --> 16:44.624
God, I wish
the doors would close!

16:51.681 --> 16:53.633
Oh, hey! I'm on
my way to meet Max,

16:53.633 --> 16:54.894
but how did
everything go with Josh?

16:54.894 --> 16:56.556
He kissed his therapist.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.310
I'm not going
on this date, am I?

17:02.102 --> 17:03.193
Okay.

17:03.193 --> 17:04.814
Tell me everything.
What happened?

17:04.814 --> 17:08.408
He kissed his therapist.
The end. Nothing else matters.

17:10.070 --> 17:12.072
So, you did that thing
where you get really mad

17:12.072 --> 17:14.114
and don't let anybody talk
and then you stormed out.

17:14.114 --> 17:15.455
Yup, I did.

17:17.247 --> 17:20.080
-What are you doing?
-I have de-Kaminskied
this apartment,

17:20.080 --> 17:21.661
I have re-Kaminskied
this apartment,

17:21.661 --> 17:25.004
and now, I am
re-de-Kaminski-ing it.

17:25.004 --> 17:27.217
I swear, Sofia,
this is the last time.

17:27.217 --> 17:29.509
That's what you said
two days ago.

17:29.509 --> 17:33.223
Gabi, look, I realize that
Josh kissing his therapist

17:33.223 --> 17:37.227
is a complete betrayal,
and you have every right
to be furious, but--

17:37.227 --> 17:38.978
No! No buts!

17:38.978 --> 17:41.561
As soon as you say "but,"
that means you're
taking his side.

17:41.561 --> 17:46.106
-All I'm saying--
-Saying "all I'm saying"
is taking his side too.

17:46.106 --> 17:47.817
Listen, just go
on your date, okay?

17:47.817 --> 17:49.359
I'm not ready to talk
calmly about this.

17:49.359 --> 17:52.322
I am so pissed,
and I don't want you
to talk me out of it.

17:52.322 --> 17:55.155
-Fine. I will leave you alone.
-Thank you.

17:55.155 --> 17:56.906
-Can I just say one more thing?
-No.

17:56.906 --> 18:00.120
You have found
your one in a million guy.

18:01.251 --> 18:03.793
I would give anything
to know who mine is.

18:03.793 --> 18:06.706
And if I ever found him,
I'd never let him go.

18:08.378 --> 18:09.469
-(door closes)
-(clang)

18:10.970 --> 18:14.344
And hey, this is in no way
me telling you what to do,

18:14.344 --> 18:17.056
but just in case,
here's my lip gloss.

18:30.029 --> 18:31.231
Thank you.

18:42.912 --> 18:44.954
Oh, my god,
what are you doing here?

18:44.954 --> 18:48.378
Coming with you
to Sydney!

18:48.378 --> 18:51.301
Oh god, this is
a huge mistake.

18:51.301 --> 18:52.212
I don't know
what I was thinking

18:52.212 --> 18:53.633
buying a ticket
to surprise you.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.305
I never do anything
spontaneous.

18:55.305 --> 18:56.306
Now I know why!

18:58.057 --> 18:59.889
-I'm gonna go.
-Wait.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.143
Gabi and I are over.

19:05.855 --> 19:08.228
She found out about our kiss
and ended things for good.

19:09.479 --> 19:10.820
You okay?

19:12.031 --> 19:13.193
Not really.

19:14.694 --> 19:15.865
Wanna talk about it?

19:22.622 --> 19:25.044
(baby crying)

19:29.999 --> 19:31.421
(sighs)

19:51.070 --> 19:52.402
Okay...

19:54.654 --> 19:57.777
Poppin' Pink lips. Check.

19:57.777 --> 19:59.529
Here goes everything.

20:07.166 --> 20:08.207
Okay.

20:29.689 --> 20:30.980
I can't get over it.

20:30.980 --> 20:34.444
You're telling me
this whole thing is fake?

20:34.444 --> 20:36.406
Yes. It's a simulation.

20:36.406 --> 20:38.858
It's the latest
and most intensive

20:38.858 --> 20:41.411
therapeutic technique
available to help people

20:41.411 --> 20:43.533
get over their fear
of flying.

20:43.533 --> 20:47.827
And it was very expensive,
but you're worth it, Fro-Yo.

20:47.827 --> 20:50.249
I can't believe you made me
pack my bags too.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.791
It's all part
of the process.

20:51.791 --> 20:55.755
So everyone on here
is afraid of flying,
just like me?

20:55.755 --> 20:57.337
Not all of them.

20:57.337 --> 20:59.258
-A few of them are actors.
-(gasps)

20:59.258 --> 21:01.301
You know,
to make it seem real.

21:01.301 --> 21:04.143
Well, damn.
They really go all out.

21:04.143 --> 21:06.225
(engine starts)

21:06.225 --> 21:07.517
(gasps)
What's that?

21:07.517 --> 21:09.939
Have they started the plane?

21:09.939 --> 21:12.101
No, no, no.

21:12.101 --> 21:14.774
It's just a sound effect.

21:14.774 --> 21:18.318
-(exhaling)
-Okay, Yolanda, time
for your fake Valium.

21:20.490 --> 21:22.452
Yolanda:
This all seems so real.

21:22.452 --> 21:25.074
Elliot:
Wait'll you see how real
they make Hawaii look.
