00:00.078 --> 00:01.781
Millwood Family Services is just doing

00:01.830 --> 00:03.389
what they're obligated to do, but,

00:03.438 --> 00:05.639
they're acting on bad science.

00:05.688 --> 00:08.210
ClearDawn's drug tests
are the real culprit here.

00:08.281 --> 00:10.781
If you're only thinking
about the science,

00:10.830 --> 00:12.789
you're not looking
at the bigger picture.

00:12.838 --> 00:14.522
So someone's cutting corners.

00:14.668 --> 00:17.139
ClearDawn Labs would like
to offer your client 25K.

00:17.224 --> 00:18.528
This isn't about the money.

00:18.586 --> 00:19.923
It's always about the money.

00:19.972 --> 00:21.178
It's too late for any of this.

00:21.227 --> 00:23.459
You aren't alone in this, Kodie.

00:23.508 --> 00:25.230
So many other mothers
have gone through this,

00:25.279 --> 00:27.373
and it's time for us to
bring them into this fight.

00:27.422 --> 00:29.186
We are gonna force
the courts to hear us.

00:29.235 --> 00:30.732
I'm here for you, to represent you.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.737
- You represent me?
- My firm would.

00:32.786 --> 00:34.678
We just need more information
about your drug test.

00:34.727 --> 00:35.822
- Taylor?
- I think there's

00:35.877 --> 00:36.937
something you need to see.

00:36.986 --> 00:38.534
It is the Court's decision
that a class action

00:38.583 --> 00:41.026
is not the procedure
for resolving this conflict.

00:41.075 --> 00:43.435
- Your Honour...
- The court denies certification.

00:44.512 --> 00:45.799
I'm pregnant.

00:45.848 --> 00:46.987
Joanna, you can't just

00:47.036 --> 00:48.120
spring something like this on me

00:48.169 --> 00:50.034
and then shut me out.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:12.378 --> 01:15.215
Can you, uh...

01:16.462 --> 01:18.229
Hear me?

01:23.713 --> 01:24.862
That's not enough.

01:24.911 --> 01:26.323
I don't know what you want from me.

01:26.372 --> 01:28.120
We want you to give us
something tangible.

01:28.169 --> 01:29.433
- This is crazy.
- Hey, Shakey.

01:29.482 --> 01:31.058
Shakey, you came to me.

01:31.107 --> 01:33.294
- You wanted to do something.
- I don't have anything.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.958
The extra revenue, off the books,

01:35.007 --> 01:37.098
- where does it go?
- Exactly, no books.

01:37.150 --> 01:39.895
- There are always books.
- Well, I don't have them.

01:39.989 --> 01:41.598
Hey, look.

01:41.702 --> 01:42.934
You knew something was wrong,

01:42.983 --> 01:44.286
and you did the right thing.

01:44.445 --> 01:46.377
But that's the easy part.

01:46.770 --> 01:48.427
It is because now, wherever you go,

01:48.476 --> 01:49.917
you're gonna
know what ClearDawn is doing,

01:49.966 --> 01:51.188
and living with that is much harder.

01:51.237 --> 01:54.239
If we can't find actual evidence,

01:54.395 --> 01:55.802
then nothing changes.

01:55.851 --> 01:57.932
You keep your job, your life.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.084
But families?

02:00.173 --> 02:01.809
They keep getting torn apart.

02:01.858 --> 02:04.125
They're too well-connected.

02:07.017 --> 02:09.384
I've... never...

02:09.434 --> 02:11.895
seen the off-the-books,

02:11.957 --> 02:16.126
but I might, maybe,
know where they keep 'em.

02:16.754 --> 02:18.362
Good, good. Where?

02:18.411 --> 02:19.614
There's a vault,

02:19.663 --> 02:21.317
for air-gapped hard drives,

02:21.366 --> 02:22.926
for the financials.

02:23.425 --> 02:25.292
They hide them in plain sight.

02:25.396 --> 02:27.663
Then you know what you have to do.

02:33.295 --> 02:35.263
You didn't send one of your henchmen?

02:35.348 --> 02:37.564
Oh, I didn't wanna miss this.

02:38.028 --> 02:40.481
ClearDawn Labs has filed
a defamation lawsuit

02:40.530 --> 02:41.817
against Kodie Chartrand,

02:41.866 --> 02:44.307
also naming Crawford Chang, LLP,

02:44.356 --> 02:47.234
for damages amounting to $14 million.

02:48.074 --> 02:49.887
You've been served.

03:05.443 --> 03:06.964
Can we talk about this?

03:07.013 --> 03:08.161
No need, it complicates things.

03:08.210 --> 03:09.269
14 million.

03:09.318 --> 03:12.356
We go to trial against
ClearDawn in less than a week.

03:12.518 --> 03:14.262
We lost certification.

03:14.374 --> 03:15.739
The only thing we can do,

03:15.820 --> 03:17.518
is go after them, we
target the company.

03:17.567 --> 03:18.708
- Joanna.
- We don't have time

03:18.757 --> 03:20.520
- to talk about this.
- How can I help?

03:20.584 --> 03:21.918
- Just sit tight.
- Right.

03:21.967 --> 03:23.521
- I'll just stay out of the way.
- Wait.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.170
Have you talked to Callie yet?

03:25.655 --> 03:27.322
Uh... It's complicated.

03:29.355 --> 03:31.338
OK. I'm not mad,

03:31.403 --> 03:34.473
but I can't worry about
if you're gonna come through.

03:36.125 --> 03:37.559
You wanna help?

03:37.965 --> 03:39.496
Talk to Callie.

03:43.646 --> 03:46.449
- Where did you get these?
- I took them.

03:46.817 --> 03:49.017
- I've been following that guy.
- Who is he?

03:49.161 --> 03:50.914
Oh, it's a long story.

03:51.168 --> 03:52.313
OK. Um...

03:52.362 --> 03:53.786
He worked for my dad and now

03:53.835 --> 03:55.223
he beats up sex workers,

03:55.272 --> 03:56.653
so not a long story, I guess.

03:56.702 --> 03:57.926
Taylor...

03:57.975 --> 03:59.442
you can't be doing this.

03:59.491 --> 04:01.714
- It's dangerous.
- What do you think they're up to?

04:06.102 --> 04:07.963
How many times did they meet?

04:08.258 --> 04:09.634
Well, four times that I saw,

04:09.683 --> 04:10.821
every week on Thursday...

04:10.870 --> 04:12.811
and Mercer always
leaves with an envelope.

04:12.860 --> 04:14.251
A payoff of some sort.

04:14.300 --> 04:15.377
Extortion, maybe.

04:15.426 --> 04:17.726
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

04:21.084 --> 04:22.649
This could be big.

04:22.805 --> 04:25.090
Mercer's gotta have a stash somewhere.

04:25.649 --> 04:27.684
I guess we just have to find it.

04:29.407 --> 04:30.553
OK, Shakey.

04:30.602 --> 04:32.458
Meet us back at our office
on your lunch.

04:32.569 --> 04:33.797
Hey.

04:33.901 --> 04:35.267
No one's gonna know.

04:35.932 --> 04:37.311
You got this.

04:44.019 --> 04:46.206
Are you kidding me?!

04:49.071 --> 04:50.875
Shakey, you gotta relax.

04:51.734 --> 04:53.906
I hope it's worth it.

04:57.268 --> 04:59.168
Yeah, me too.

05:20.844 --> 05:22.632
He brought it home.

05:23.206 --> 05:25.077
Typical lazy cop.

05:26.018 --> 05:27.402
Mm-hmm.

05:27.568 --> 05:29.000
Ahem.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.248
Bingo.

05:33.329 --> 05:34.574
We gotta get in there.

05:34.638 --> 05:37.006
- That's breaking and entering.
- Yeah, so?

05:37.851 --> 05:40.526
You know I'm the chief of police,
right?

05:54.043 --> 05:55.639
Couldn't wait, huh?

05:56.146 --> 05:58.434
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah.

05:58.482 --> 06:00.945
I just needed a strep-B swab

06:00.994 --> 06:02.380
or I wouldn't be in here.

06:02.429 --> 06:05.341
She hasn't stopped eyeing me
since she opened my file.

06:07.111 --> 06:08.177
We need to talk.

06:08.288 --> 06:09.405
OK.

06:10.033 --> 06:11.624
That's a little unnerving.

06:11.986 --> 06:13.445
I'm sorry.

06:13.557 --> 06:15.384
I tried everything.

06:16.054 --> 06:18.087
We can't take your case.

06:18.405 --> 06:20.265
What the hell, Luna?!

06:20.440 --> 06:21.843
I left Eric!

06:21.939 --> 06:23.031
Not only did I leave Eric,

06:23.080 --> 06:24.296
- but I pissed him off!
- I know.

06:24.345 --> 06:25.434
I know and I'm sorry.

06:25.483 --> 06:26.747
I'm still gonna help you.

06:26.796 --> 06:28.931
You can stay at my place.
You're safe there.

06:29.125 --> 06:30.272
For how long?

06:30.392 --> 06:32.211
As long as it takes
to figure things out.

06:32.260 --> 06:33.576
Figure what out?!

06:33.658 --> 06:37.032
- Callie, I'm... I'm...
- Just leave me alone!

06:38.046 --> 06:39.359
I was better off before

06:39.408 --> 06:41.294
you came knocking on my door.

06:43.176 --> 06:45.364
Oh, not here...

06:45.482 --> 06:47.883
- Not here.
- Callie...

06:49.891 --> 06:51.176
What?

06:54.604 --> 06:57.280
Is that Shakey?

07:04.575 --> 07:06.296
- Hey, what's going on?
- They know.

07:06.345 --> 07:07.416
What are you talking about?

07:07.465 --> 07:08.713
I shouldn't have listened to you.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.853
- They were all over me.
- Did you get caught?

07:10.902 --> 07:13.479
Sol... Solomon came right over to me,

07:13.541 --> 07:16.257
was talking about good...
or maybe loyalty?

07:16.306 --> 07:17.947
You're probably just being paranoid.

07:17.995 --> 07:19.728
- I'm not paranoid!
- Let's just sit down.

07:19.777 --> 07:21.057
There's water in the conference room.

07:21.105 --> 07:22.986
- No. I'm leaving town.
- No, you can't leave!

07:23.035 --> 07:24.186
He's gonna come after me!

07:24.234 --> 07:25.322
Who, Solomon?

07:25.371 --> 07:28.127
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

07:34.560 --> 07:35.939
Billy...

07:36.346 --> 07:37.533
We need him.

07:48.091 --> 07:50.379
- OK, you can't be serious.
- It's dangerous.

07:50.427 --> 07:52.032
I'll be fine!

07:53.776 --> 07:55.539
You need a badge
to go any further than this.

07:55.588 --> 07:57.526
You wouldn't have anything
if it wasn't for me!

07:57.575 --> 07:59.417
You did really well,

07:59.614 --> 08:01.480
but I got it from here.

08:10.546 --> 08:11.823
Hello, Sam.

08:11.872 --> 08:13.702
You know Jerry, your parole officer.

08:13.750 --> 08:15.565
- Jerry.
- Sam.

08:15.657 --> 08:17.298
We're gonna take a look around.

08:17.377 --> 08:19.153
Hope that's OK.

08:40.417 --> 08:41.938
- Luna, come on...

09:31.365 --> 09:33.820
If you come after him in any way...

09:33.937 --> 09:36.013
I help people, Mr. Crawford.

09:36.101 --> 09:37.395
Right.

09:37.726 --> 09:40.130
- We believe you, Mr. Stone.
- Doctor.

09:40.179 --> 09:41.529
And by allowing us,

09:41.578 --> 09:42.904
to take a look into your procedure,

09:42.953 --> 09:45.050
I'm sure we could
figure this whole thing out.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.751
I would be fine with that,

09:46.800 --> 09:48.168
but you know lawyers.

09:48.784 --> 09:50.304
Of course you do.

09:51.144 --> 09:52.574
I understand that you are trying

09:52.648 --> 09:53.721
to help out your friend,

09:53.770 --> 09:55.091
but did you ever stop

09:55.140 --> 09:56.343
and consider that maybe

09:56.391 --> 09:57.568
she shouldn't be a mother?

09:57.617 --> 09:58.827
That's not your call to make.

09:58.876 --> 10:01.164
You know as well as anyone
it's complicated.

10:01.614 --> 10:03.424
Justice relies on us,

10:03.473 --> 10:05.036
heavily at times.

10:05.366 --> 10:07.403
People lie, Ms. Hanley.

10:07.452 --> 10:08.783
Or Chang, is it?

10:08.832 --> 10:10.899
Get to your point, Mr. Stone.

10:13.192 --> 10:15.381
ClearDawn is an opportunity,

10:15.476 --> 10:17.302
to fix broken homes,

10:17.351 --> 10:19.867
to give children the
childhoods they deserve.

10:20.147 --> 10:21.947
I was put on this earth,

10:22.012 --> 10:23.137
to help children,

10:23.234 --> 10:24.872
and even if we got something wrong,

10:24.921 --> 10:26.277
which we did not,

10:26.458 --> 10:28.216
the good we do would outweigh

10:28.265 --> 10:29.407
any mistake.

10:29.456 --> 10:30.904
Please, tell that to our client.

10:30.953 --> 10:32.802
I'd love to see what she does.

10:34.377 --> 10:36.583
I came here with a peace offering.

10:36.632 --> 10:37.967
Our lawsuit goes away

10:38.016 --> 10:39.784
the second you drop yours.

10:40.184 --> 10:42.172
Unlike you, we're not out for blood.

10:45.163 --> 10:46.557
See you soon.

10:55.398 --> 10:56.677
We're getting you out of here.

10:56.726 --> 10:57.854
This can't be happening.

10:57.903 --> 10:59.700
- It's gonna be OK.
- They'll take the baby!

10:59.749 --> 11:01.223
They won't.

11:02.707 --> 11:04.895
OK. Let's turn around. Nice and slow.

11:04.944 --> 11:06.474
I need a minute.

11:06.576 --> 11:09.064
- Now's not a good time.
- I need a minute!

11:12.286 --> 11:13.513
Ms. Sparrow.

11:13.562 --> 11:14.865
It's OK, just relax.

11:14.921 --> 11:16.130
There's nothing you can do

11:16.179 --> 11:17.294
until the contractions are

11:17.343 --> 11:18.860
less than four minutes apart.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.510
It's OK, we'll take care of you.

11:20.706 --> 11:22.564
We might need a wheelchair.

11:27.397 --> 11:28.483
You good?

11:28.532 --> 11:29.801
OK. Let's go.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.506
Hey! What's the emergency?

11:32.572 --> 11:34.412
Oh, my...

11:34.539 --> 11:36.014
We need to get her out of here.

11:36.115 --> 11:37.811
Isn't here exactly
where she needs to be?

11:37.860 --> 11:39.140
This baby needs to
be born off the grid.

11:39.189 --> 11:40.616
You wanted to do
something that matters?

11:40.772 --> 11:42.737
O-O-OK. My car's parked out front.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.413
He walked in here
like he was bulletproof.

11:44.462 --> 11:46.764
I haven't seen anyone
lie that well since...

11:46.813 --> 11:48.498
Since my father?

11:48.652 --> 11:50.674
Except this guy's more dangerous.

11:50.850 --> 11:52.061
Why?

11:52.204 --> 11:53.552
Because he believes

11:53.601 --> 11:55.361
every word he's saying, it's...

11:55.521 --> 11:57.843
Like he's on some righteous mission.

12:00.310 --> 12:03.529
What if he's the target, not ClearDawn?

12:03.762 --> 12:05.122
He's been pulling
the strings all along.

12:05.170 --> 12:06.639
We convince the jury he's gone rogue,

12:06.688 --> 12:07.913
that he's been manipulating

12:07.962 --> 12:09.108
the data to fit his mission.

12:09.157 --> 12:10.373
And if Solomon's gone rogue,

12:10.422 --> 12:11.561
then ClearDawn has an out.

12:11.618 --> 12:13.234
It's something.

12:14.303 --> 12:15.899
Should we talk about the other option?

12:15.947 --> 12:17.490
- What option?
- Drop the lawsuit.

12:17.539 --> 12:18.631
Focus on Kodie's trial.

12:18.680 --> 12:19.736
No, not a chance.

12:19.784 --> 12:21.108
Look, we swing and miss here, Joanna,

12:21.157 --> 12:23.811
then you, me, Kodie,
we're all on the hook.

12:24.110 --> 12:25.651
It ruins us.

12:26.416 --> 12:28.883
And it's not just us we have
to think about anymore.

12:31.139 --> 12:33.817
We don't have a case, Billy.

12:34.459 --> 12:36.686
We can't win at Kodie's trial,

12:36.948 --> 12:39.076
which means this...

12:39.290 --> 12:42.059
Is our only shot at
getting her kids back.

12:44.166 --> 12:46.076
We're drowning.

12:47.004 --> 12:49.304
Going deeper's our only way out.

12:50.781 --> 12:53.737
It just means that we can't miss.

12:54.389 --> 12:56.014
Where are we going, exactly?

12:56.063 --> 12:57.828
Grand Rapids, my cousin's a midwife.

12:57.877 --> 12:58.928
She'll help me.

12:58.977 --> 13:00.366
That's like, a few hours north.

13:00.415 --> 13:01.943
Are you sure you don't want
to go to a hospital?

13:01.992 --> 13:04.238
I can't! I'll walk if I have to.

13:04.287 --> 13:05.733
No. We're with you.

13:08.556 --> 13:10.757
- You need to drive fast.
- OK.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.174
You look worried!

13:40.804 --> 13:42.226
You can't interfere.

13:42.291 --> 13:43.602
Where's Jerry?

13:43.687 --> 13:45.768
He's downstairs.

13:47.405 --> 13:48.718
Tell me what you're looking for,

13:48.767 --> 13:50.087
I can help you find it.

13:54.158 --> 13:55.976
Well, hmm.

14:04.346 --> 14:07.148
Wondering if you've played
your hand too early?

14:07.615 --> 14:09.077
I would be.

14:10.038 --> 14:11.695
Ah, what happened to you, Chief?

14:11.744 --> 14:12.919
Look at you...

14:13.160 --> 14:15.921
On your hands and knees
looking for God knows what.

14:15.970 --> 14:17.663
You gonna plant something?

14:18.123 --> 14:19.490
Drugs?

14:24.698 --> 14:26.486
Ah, don't worry.

14:26.777 --> 14:28.874
I know you don't
have the balls for that.

14:35.038 --> 14:36.976
Graduated top of his class,

14:37.025 --> 14:38.283
he's a philanthropist.

14:38.337 --> 14:39.406
Look, he's even on the board

14:39.455 --> 14:41.058
of a children's theatre company.

14:41.651 --> 14:43.112
He's trying too hard.

14:43.471 --> 14:45.443
Any other suits against ClearDawn?

14:47.429 --> 14:49.343
Nothing, no litigation,

14:49.392 --> 14:51.146
Board members seem above board.

14:51.202 --> 14:52.383
OK. Further back.

14:52.432 --> 14:54.787
- Where'd he grow up?
- Uh, there, I got...

14:55.863 --> 14:56.929
Nothin'.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.445
That's weird.

14:58.674 --> 15:00.218
What's the farthest back you've seen?

15:00.267 --> 15:03.054
Hmm, him taking the job at ClearDawn,

15:03.103 --> 15:05.513
in 199... 8.

15:06.452 --> 15:08.607
It's like he doesn't exist before that.

15:09.388 --> 15:12.084
How's that possible, even in the '90s?

15:14.012 --> 15:16.253
Type in "Joanna Chang".

15:16.694 --> 15:18.576
You think he changed his name?

15:19.023 --> 15:20.228
Why?

15:21.165 --> 15:23.450
He's running from something.

15:25.595 --> 15:26.999
OK, thanks.

15:27.101 --> 15:28.166
Billy,

15:28.215 --> 15:29.781
the clerk says we
need the original name

15:29.830 --> 15:30.945
to search the registry.

15:30.994 --> 15:32.044
Great.

15:32.093 --> 15:33.925
OK, so,
what couldn't he change his name on?

15:33.991 --> 15:36.378
- Birth certificate?
- No, that's easy enough.

15:36.544 --> 15:38.156
News article, maybe? School?

15:38.288 --> 15:40.562
I guess anything in print
before the name change.

15:40.752 --> 15:42.372
Could he change his name on his degree?

15:42.420 --> 15:43.726
Probably.

15:44.048 --> 15:45.414
But I'm pretty sure they wouldn't

15:45.463 --> 15:47.216
reprint the yearbook for him.

15:47.499 --> 15:49.772
Oh, I guess we're doing this
the old fashioned way.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.583
You used to be so noble.

16:01.008 --> 16:02.133
Any time now, boy.

16:02.182 --> 16:03.756
I've got somewhere to be.

16:06.359 --> 16:07.687
You gonna clean that up?

16:07.853 --> 16:09.882
See, the thing about being chief now...

16:10.242 --> 16:12.442
Is I don't have to clean up your shit.

16:15.388 --> 16:17.189
There's no need for this.

16:19.890 --> 16:22.025
HEY, COME ON!

16:34.647 --> 16:36.024
You don't wanna do this.

16:36.168 --> 16:37.595
Oh, I'm sure I do.

16:59.181 --> 17:00.917
Blackmail.

17:02.340 --> 17:04.834
That's a very serious offence.

17:09.166 --> 17:11.021
Wow, I'm impressed, Sam.

17:11.140 --> 17:13.337
Is there anybody
you weren't blackmailing?

17:14.837 --> 17:16.009
Oh, you didn't think it was

17:16.058 --> 17:17.449
gonna be that easy, did you?

17:20.031 --> 17:21.738
You might wanna look through those

17:21.786 --> 17:25.018
before you ride off
on your high horse, Tonto.

17:26.856 --> 17:30.232
Look for... Principal and Bulldog.

17:34.231 --> 17:35.821
Yeah.

17:40.666 --> 17:42.787
Might be of interest to you.

17:48.222 --> 17:49.682
Ooh.

17:53.258 --> 17:54.859
Is everyone OK?

17:55.042 --> 17:57.087
Yeah, everyone's fine, Jerry.

17:57.773 --> 18:00.267
I must not have set those bins right.

18:07.259 --> 18:08.918
I got copies of those.

18:24.948 --> 18:26.831
He could be about 50, right?

18:26.901 --> 18:29.205
Yeah, so sometime in the mid-'90s?

18:29.253 --> 18:30.903
OK.

18:37.590 --> 18:39.333
How do people have time for sports?

18:39.382 --> 18:41.990
- I was always in the library.
- Nerd.

18:44.033 --> 18:45.950
Oh, hang on a second.

18:46.739 --> 18:48.622
"Notable was Solomon Stafford"

18:48.671 --> 18:50.233
"as Michael Cassio" in Othello.

18:50.426 --> 18:52.137
That's enough of a name change

18:52.195 --> 18:53.801
to avoid an internet search.

18:55.799 --> 18:57.600
Solomon Stafford.

18:59.844 --> 19:02.400
OK, it's a newsletter from a school,

19:02.793 --> 19:04.289
Legacy Pines. I've been there.

19:04.338 --> 19:05.802
And when was this?

19:05.950 --> 19:07.759
It was before he went to med school...

19:07.934 --> 19:09.169
and "saving children"

19:09.218 --> 19:11.078
is why he was "put on this earth".

19:13.723 --> 19:15.540
"Legacy Pines Scandal."

19:15.621 --> 19:17.452
"Solomon Stafford brought in
for questioning,"

19:17.501 --> 19:19.238
"in the death of a student."

19:21.676 --> 19:23.466
No charges were ever laid.

19:23.569 --> 19:25.387
They found another suspect?

19:25.700 --> 19:28.059
Or they just couldn't prove it was him.

19:42.903 --> 19:44.804
Careful, careful.

19:46.809 --> 19:48.731
Nice to finally meet face-to-face.

19:49.342 --> 19:50.583
Yes.

19:50.645 --> 19:51.942
I'm sorry I couldn't see you before.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.958
You're busy, I get it.
I'm Joanna Chang.

19:54.007 --> 19:55.317
This is my partner, William Crawford.

19:55.366 --> 19:56.765
Eli Roberts.

19:57.116 --> 19:58.866
- You're lawyers?
- Yes.

19:58.915 --> 20:01.122
We, uh, wanted to talk to
you about Solomon Stone.

20:01.186 --> 20:02.919
Or Stafford.

20:03.548 --> 20:05.052
Excuse me.

20:05.692 --> 20:07.981
- Mr. Roberts...
- It was a scar on the school.

20:08.863 --> 20:10.480
I'm sure you know that
if you're asking.

20:10.538 --> 20:11.606
We wanna know about...

20:11.655 --> 20:13.224
I don't really have time right now.

20:13.273 --> 20:14.473
We just wanna know about...

20:14.522 --> 20:16.677
I came back here
to undo the damage he did.

20:18.368 --> 20:20.326
Not about to reopen old wounds, so.

20:21.028 --> 20:22.271
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

20:22.320 --> 20:23.591
You know what he's doing now?

20:26.014 --> 20:27.747
I have to ask you to leave.

20:34.919 --> 20:36.036
Owen.

20:36.124 --> 20:37.629
Where'd you get this?

20:37.768 --> 20:39.892
- You wouldn't believe me.
- Try us.

20:41.773 --> 20:42.919
I really can't say.

20:42.967 --> 20:44.521
I know there are lines you can't cross,

20:44.570 --> 20:46.603
but we need to make
sure this is verified.

20:47.482 --> 20:49.458
- Sam Mercer had it.
- Excuse me?

20:49.507 --> 20:50.752
It looks like he's been blackmailing

20:50.801 --> 20:52.010
people in Millwood for years.

20:52.059 --> 20:53.540
I saw "ClearDawn" at the top.

20:53.589 --> 20:54.760
Thought this mess might at least

20:54.809 --> 20:55.896
help Kodie get her kids back.

20:55.945 --> 20:56.996
Any idea what it is?

20:57.045 --> 20:58.799
If I had to guess, account numbers.

20:59.739 --> 21:01.356
Every piece I found was

21:01.405 --> 21:03.098
under a code name, so...

21:03.215 --> 21:04.286
If I were you, I'd...

21:04.335 --> 21:05.997
Figure out who "Late-Night Cheerleader"

21:06.046 --> 21:07.637
and "Teach" are?

21:11.316 --> 21:13.116
Hey, I thought you would've
been happier about this.

21:13.243 --> 21:14.520
Yeah.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.201
It's complicated.

21:26.668 --> 21:27.771
Cat, what you got?

21:27.820 --> 21:29.129
Apparently, there was a civil suit

21:29.178 --> 21:30.231
against Solomon Stafford,

21:30.280 --> 21:31.408
but it was dismissed.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.153
- Any names?
- The lawyer of record,

21:33.202 --> 21:34.265
Harper Bailey.

21:34.314 --> 21:35.685
She no longer practices, but I found

21:35.734 --> 21:37.014
an address in the Millwood phonebook.

21:37.062 --> 21:38.112
She got an address.

21:38.176 --> 21:39.638
That's great, maybe she can give us

21:39.687 --> 21:41.103
something we can actually use.

21:41.152 --> 21:42.575
Cat, we're sending you a document.

21:42.624 --> 21:43.942
It's related to ClearDawn.

21:43.991 --> 21:45.232
We need you to see
if you can track down

21:45.280 --> 21:46.404
any of these account numbers.

21:46.453 --> 21:47.575
On it.

21:48.163 --> 21:49.786
Any of these ring a bell

21:49.981 --> 21:51.450
"Cheerleader", "Teach"?

21:51.499 --> 21:52.879
No, it doesn't make sense to me.

21:52.928 --> 21:53.990
We just need to figure out

21:54.038 --> 21:55.317
how it makes sense to Mercer.

21:55.406 --> 21:56.855
Onward.

22:14.192 --> 22:15.812
You know I love you, right?

22:15.860 --> 22:17.499
That I'd never do anything

22:17.548 --> 22:18.782
to put you in harm's way?

22:19.266 --> 22:20.750
That's a terrifying start.

22:20.798 --> 22:22.375
I got Mercer.

22:23.459 --> 22:24.600
I actually got him.

22:26.337 --> 22:29.305
He's been blackmailing people
while he's on parole.

22:32.266 --> 22:34.642
- That's amazing!
- Yeah.

22:34.894 --> 22:36.193
Hey...

22:36.521 --> 22:38.642
He's gonna go away for good.

22:39.795 --> 22:41.013
OK...

22:41.102 --> 22:42.547
You're starting to scare me.

22:42.694 --> 22:43.936
Well, I got lost...

22:45.364 --> 22:47.585
Somewhere along the way.

22:48.279 --> 22:50.120
I got sloppy and, um...

22:50.342 --> 22:52.857
OK, seriously, what's going on?

22:55.654 --> 22:58.054
He knows why your marriage broke up.

23:01.900 --> 23:04.262
Oh... Uh...

23:04.897 --> 23:06.797
That was, um...

23:08.352 --> 23:10.374
That was a long time ago, Owen.

23:14.021 --> 23:16.091
It was just...

23:17.228 --> 23:18.678
It was just some

23:18.727 --> 23:20.717
workplace affair,
I'm not proud of it...

23:20.766 --> 23:23.745
He's got pictures, Diane.

23:47.519 --> 23:49.270
I'm sorry.

23:57.251 --> 23:58.639
Ahem.

24:00.984 --> 24:02.341
Did you eat anything today?

24:02.390 --> 24:05.033
I can't eat because I feel
like I'm going to throw up.

24:05.082 --> 24:07.283
But if I don't eat, I do throw up.

24:07.675 --> 24:09.108
I'm fine.

24:10.864 --> 24:12.726
Mr. Bailey, thank you,

24:12.775 --> 24:14.468
- for your hospitality.
- Oh!

24:14.517 --> 24:16.125
We just... We don't have much time.

24:16.174 --> 24:17.558
Is your wife home?

24:18.140 --> 24:19.250
Uh...

24:19.299 --> 24:20.879
She's fragile these days.

24:20.928 --> 24:23.030
I'm not sure I should disturb her yet.

24:23.485 --> 24:24.789
Uh...

24:24.924 --> 24:27.134
I don't know that you'll
be able to help us.

24:27.569 --> 24:29.833
The details we need
pertain to a particular case.

24:29.913 --> 24:31.838
I promise we won't upset her.

24:32.188 --> 24:34.379
She worked on a case
that was dismissed.

24:34.442 --> 24:36.265
We just need to know why.

24:36.524 --> 24:39.546
Tell me why you're looking
into Solomon Stafford.

24:41.187 --> 24:43.265
- We never said...
- You didn't have to.

24:43.314 --> 24:44.780
How could you possibly know

24:44.829 --> 24:46.279
which case we were talking about?

24:46.359 --> 24:49.224
My wife only became
a lawyer after David...

24:51.805 --> 24:54.729
She only tried one case.

24:55.038 --> 24:57.591
The boy who died was your son.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.523
Taylor, how much farther
to Grand Rapids?

25:07.652 --> 25:09.163
Uh, a bit to go.

25:09.253 --> 25:10.821
Actually, a lot to go.

25:12.187 --> 25:13.343
I'm not gonna make it.

25:13.392 --> 25:14.993
- I'm not gonna make it.
- We need to find a doctor,

25:15.041 --> 25:16.091
or a hospital.

25:16.422 --> 25:18.514
This baby's coming out.
We don't have a choice.

25:18.562 --> 25:20.019
If we go to a hospital,

25:20.111 --> 25:22.085
I'll never see this baby again.

25:22.202 --> 25:23.984
If we can't make it there...

25:24.572 --> 25:25.925
We'll do it ourselves.

25:25.974 --> 25:27.248
WHAT?!

25:27.297 --> 25:28.886
People have been having babies,

25:28.935 --> 25:30.534
longer than there have been hospitals.

25:30.629 --> 25:32.739
I... I can't...

25:32.801 --> 25:35.071
- Pull over!
- Are you crazy?!

25:35.183 --> 25:37.593
Pull over! This baby is coming out.

25:40.052 --> 25:42.333
Don't worry, I'm not nearly as fragile

25:42.382 --> 25:43.810
as he gives me credit for.

25:43.859 --> 25:45.271
No one survives law school

25:45.320 --> 25:46.753
if they're fragile, Mrs. Bailey.

25:46.802 --> 25:48.076
Harper, please.

25:48.187 --> 25:50.139
Of course, Harper.

25:51.338 --> 25:54.507
Can you tell us what
happened to your son?

25:56.264 --> 25:58.115
David had come back

25:58.164 --> 25:59.902
for the holidays one semester

25:59.951 --> 26:01.599
and he felt...

26:02.523 --> 26:03.639
Different.

26:03.950 --> 26:05.703
He was cold.

26:06.788 --> 26:09.668
We hadn't always been the closest,
but...

26:10.638 --> 26:12.616
He told us that Solomon...

26:12.665 --> 26:14.930
Mr. Stafford... had said that we...

26:17.747 --> 26:19.779
I'm sorry. Um...

26:21.610 --> 26:23.032
He was concerned

26:23.159 --> 26:25.286
about David's safety...

26:26.044 --> 26:28.490
If he continued to live with us.

26:30.185 --> 26:31.349
The year before,

26:31.398 --> 26:32.490
I was driving

26:32.539 --> 26:34.470
and I got into an accident.

26:35.819 --> 26:37.706
David was in the car.

26:38.099 --> 26:40.242
He was fine, but I...

26:42.690 --> 26:44.318
...I'd been drinking.

26:44.718 --> 26:46.425
Were you charged?

26:48.139 --> 26:49.623
No.

26:49.773 --> 26:51.669
I cleaned up my act.

26:52.599 --> 26:54.911
Thought that we'd gotten
through it, but...

26:55.536 --> 26:57.066
I guess Solomon

26:57.115 --> 26:58.739
couldn't let go of that.

26:58.997 --> 27:01.377
He drove a wedge between David and me.

27:02.498 --> 27:04.318
It was like he'd...

27:04.681 --> 27:06.497
He'd brainwashed him...

27:06.773 --> 27:08.856
Wiped away everything good...

27:09.192 --> 27:11.988
Until all that was left
was the accident.

27:13.775 --> 27:15.915
So David... ran away

27:15.964 --> 27:17.954
with his friend, Elliott, to go to him.

27:18.003 --> 27:20.805
Or maybe to just get away from us.

27:22.265 --> 27:23.925
What happened to Elliott?

27:24.590 --> 27:26.507
We could never find him.

27:27.599 --> 27:29.594
No witnesses, no charges.

27:29.681 --> 27:31.430
And you have no idea where he went?

27:31.534 --> 27:33.641
No, he's alive... somewhere.

27:33.790 --> 27:36.594
But... no idea.

27:37.623 --> 27:40.019
And how do you know he's alive?

27:41.641 --> 27:43.130
Honey?

27:46.227 --> 27:48.428
He's... sent us a card,

27:48.477 --> 27:50.698
on the anniversary of David's death,

27:50.746 --> 27:52.250
almost every year since.

27:52.299 --> 27:54.102
Usually a picture inside...

27:54.485 --> 27:56.119
Of the two of them.

27:56.628 --> 27:58.599
And an apology.

27:59.602 --> 28:02.923
Can we see one of those pictures?

28:15.281 --> 28:16.469
No...

28:17.323 --> 28:18.463
What is it?

28:18.512 --> 28:20.108
Do you recognize him?!

28:22.076 --> 28:23.931
Actually, um...

28:25.556 --> 28:27.454
We know where he is.

28:32.290 --> 28:34.002
Joanna, slow down.

28:34.284 --> 28:35.767
We don't even know what law he broke.

28:35.840 --> 28:36.924
He didn't kill anyone,

28:36.973 --> 28:38.344
and there's no charge for brainwashing.

28:38.393 --> 28:39.453
She didn't have any witnesses.

28:39.502 --> 28:40.727
Only Elliott knows the full story.

28:40.776 --> 28:41.834
There has to be more.

28:41.883 --> 28:43.165
No, we have to think about another way,

28:43.214 --> 28:45.446
- to come at this.
- There is no other way.

28:54.527 --> 28:55.694
Ahem.

28:57.415 --> 28:59.180
Do they, um...

28:59.685 --> 29:01.141
Do they know where I am?

29:01.199 --> 29:03.454
You need to tell us what you know, Eli.

29:05.073 --> 29:06.434
I mean...

29:06.703 --> 29:07.969
It's been so long.

29:08.073 --> 29:09.242
I'm not sure I'd remember.

29:09.291 --> 29:10.702
Yeah, I don't believe
that for a second.

29:10.773 --> 29:13.097
You can't hide from this anymore.

29:17.802 --> 29:19.314
You have no idea what he was like.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.881
OK, so help us understand.

29:27.813 --> 29:29.182
He would like...

29:30.224 --> 29:32.341
Like, get into our heads.

29:34.753 --> 29:36.553
Twisted us.

29:39.626 --> 29:42.151
He had this way of making us...

29:43.359 --> 29:45.049
Need to make him proud.

29:46.907 --> 29:48.093
I don't know how to explain it.

29:48.198 --> 29:49.334
I don't... I...

29:49.383 --> 29:51.677
I don't know, it's just...

29:51.951 --> 29:54.188
We just suddenly didn't see
our parents anymore.

29:54.237 --> 29:55.861
He was all we could see.

29:56.010 --> 29:57.117
And...

29:57.226 --> 29:58.877
And it seemed right at the time,

29:59.035 --> 30:00.719
So we ran away.

30:00.875 --> 30:02.586
And we knew, and I...

30:02.865 --> 30:03.969
I don't know why

30:04.018 --> 30:05.696
but somehow, we just knew,

30:05.760 --> 30:07.219
that we could never,

30:07.268 --> 30:08.539
ever go back to them.

30:11.633 --> 30:14.211
Did he specifically
ask you to run away?

30:15.687 --> 30:17.455
I mean...

30:17.959 --> 30:19.779
No, not in... not in those words,

30:19.828 --> 30:22.153
- but there was...
- What happened to David?

30:23.243 --> 30:24.634
Um...

30:27.776 --> 30:29.110
Uh...

30:29.405 --> 30:31.313
David had...

30:32.371 --> 30:34.158
An asthma attack.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.234
The cold got to him.

30:36.359 --> 30:37.791
He was bigger...

30:37.905 --> 30:39.383
Bigger than me, and,

30:39.447 --> 30:40.897
I couldn't...

30:42.388 --> 30:43.758
I couldn't pick him up.

30:43.846 --> 30:45.482
So just left him?!

30:46.711 --> 30:48.172
No!

30:49.125 --> 30:50.492
No, I didn't have a choice!

30:50.541 --> 30:52.729
- Yes, you did!
- Joanna.

30:52.914 --> 30:54.211
Did Solomon threaten you,

30:54.260 --> 30:55.328
is that why you ran away?

30:55.377 --> 30:57.376
Take it easy.

30:57.527 --> 30:59.180
Uh, it's just like somehow, he just...

30:59.229 --> 31:00.368
Just...

31:00.417 --> 31:01.891
Made us think that
that was our only option,

31:01.940 --> 31:03.109
that was the only thing we could do!

31:03.158 --> 31:04.421
Was he abusive,

31:04.470 --> 31:05.756
physically or emotionally?

31:05.805 --> 31:07.407
He wasn't like that,
he didn't actually ever...

31:07.456 --> 31:09.492
Did he do anything at all?
Because right now,

31:09.541 --> 31:11.203
it sounds like you just ran away,

31:11.252 --> 31:12.320
and got your friend killed.

31:12.369 --> 31:13.422
No, that's not what...

31:13.471 --> 31:15.678
I don't know! I don't... I don't know!

31:16.088 --> 31:17.689
I can't...

31:17.738 --> 31:19.015
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

31:20.273 --> 31:21.779
I can't do this.

31:27.862 --> 31:29.477
What happens if you use it?

31:29.718 --> 31:32.304
- I'm not going to.
- What happens, Owen?!

31:34.985 --> 31:36.819
He goes to jail.

31:37.880 --> 31:39.438
He serves his time and then some,

31:39.495 --> 31:40.775
and he doesn't get out.

31:41.742 --> 31:43.768
But he'll release the photos.

31:44.919 --> 31:46.637
And everyone sees them

31:46.989 --> 31:49.239
teachers, students, my kids.

31:50.875 --> 31:52.101
I'll find another way.

31:52.150 --> 31:54.739
- Ahem.
- What other way?

31:55.265 --> 31:57.519
There is no other way.

31:57.568 --> 31:59.203
These photos aren't
just gonna disappear!

31:59.252 --> 32:02.608
He will always, have this over me!

32:07.878 --> 32:09.196
And what about us?

32:13.196 --> 32:15.433
There's only one thing I can do.

32:20.980 --> 32:23.602
What does this affidavit even prove?

32:24.220 --> 32:26.403
A pattern of playing God?

32:27.436 --> 32:28.486
We're on the right track.

32:28.534 --> 32:30.515
We just have to find
something that sticks.

32:32.240 --> 32:33.882
Are you OK?

32:34.000 --> 32:35.888
We need to get inside Mercer's head.

32:36.296 --> 32:38.500
We need to figure out
what those account numbers are.

32:38.549 --> 32:39.693
That's not what I meant.

32:39.742 --> 32:41.091
And how is ClearDawn,

32:41.140 --> 32:42.695
the only company doing these tests?

32:42.775 --> 32:44.373
How are they getting these contracts?

32:44.437 --> 32:46.755
Well, people must not have known.

32:47.303 --> 32:48.696
The province would've done

32:48.745 --> 32:50.172
a thorough background check,

32:50.282 --> 32:51.752
Name change or not.

32:51.976 --> 32:53.911
And with the faulty tests,
it doesn't make any sense.

32:54.060 --> 32:55.640
It's not the province.

32:57.582 --> 32:59.455
Millwood took over
the regional management.

32:59.504 --> 33:01.390
So who gives out the contracts then?

33:01.518 --> 33:03.673
Some council at City Hall.

33:04.916 --> 33:07.726
Oh. Maybe Shepherd could
get us something on this.

33:12.203 --> 33:13.637
I, um...

33:13.758 --> 33:15.120
I do know,

33:15.169 --> 33:17.774
what that's like, so it's, um...

33:19.927 --> 33:21.378
I'm sorry.

33:22.124 --> 33:23.920
Please, just...

33:24.970 --> 33:27.229
Let me know if there's
anything I can do.

33:36.225 --> 33:37.780
How to deliver a baby.

33:37.829 --> 33:39.342
I found it on the web.

33:39.391 --> 33:40.819
OK, um, bedsheets.

33:40.868 --> 33:42.426
Something clean to put underneath...

33:42.475 --> 33:44.108
Use my blanket, put that underneath her.

33:44.201 --> 33:45.397
Tell her to breathe and push.

33:45.446 --> 33:46.691
I'm not deaf!

33:46.739 --> 33:48.452
Breathe, Callie. Push.

33:48.501 --> 33:49.723
Get me out of this car!

33:49.772 --> 33:51.022
You're doing great, really!

33:51.071 --> 33:52.404
Yeah, are you comfortable?

33:52.453 --> 33:54.077
Are you kidding me?!

33:54.126 --> 33:55.381
I don't... It says to ask that.

33:55.430 --> 33:57.506
- OK, next?
- OK, um, Callie,

33:57.555 --> 33:58.779
when the contractions come,

33:58.828 --> 33:59.967
just breathe and p...

34:00.016 --> 34:01.303
push with the pain.

34:01.352 --> 34:02.664
It's gonna be OK, Callie.

34:02.713 --> 34:04.897
- We got this, Lu.
- Get me out of this car!

34:04.946 --> 34:06.217
You're almost there, don't worry.

34:06.266 --> 34:08.163
No! I want the first thing

34:08.212 --> 34:10.141
this child sees to be the sky.

34:12.195 --> 34:13.732
OK! We're gonna get you out of here.

34:13.781 --> 34:14.884
Just breathe, it's OK.

34:29.114 --> 34:30.650
Sam Mercer.

34:32.607 --> 34:34.138
You're under arrest.

34:35.639 --> 34:37.440
You might wanna ask
your old lady about that.

34:37.491 --> 34:38.690
Oh, I did.

34:39.214 --> 34:40.985
Turns out she's not afraid.

34:41.373 --> 34:43.293
Certainly not afraid of you.

34:44.195 --> 34:46.716
No, I'm here because she told me to be.

34:47.583 --> 34:50.139
- Look, Owen...
- You know what I was wondering?

34:51.005 --> 34:54.085
Does your wife know
that you took those?

34:55.212 --> 34:58.253
Sneaking around,
taking naked pictures of people?

34:59.551 --> 35:01.948
I mean, Diane taught your daughter.

35:02.930 --> 35:05.885
Does she know what kind of thing
her dad's been up to?

35:06.334 --> 35:07.803
And what about your boy?

35:07.852 --> 35:09.842
I mean,
would he be proud of the old man?

35:09.891 --> 35:11.973
I mean, I wonder what he would say.

35:15.952 --> 35:17.707
Sounds like you're blackmailing me.

35:17.756 --> 35:19.406
I guess I am.

35:20.738 --> 35:22.700
But I'm taking you in, Sam.

35:23.373 --> 35:26.233
And you're gonna
destroy every last photo.

35:26.282 --> 35:29.086
Every last copy.

35:30.756 --> 35:33.053
Now, put down the wrench.

35:33.298 --> 35:34.576
Be smart.

35:47.641 --> 35:50.107
The story ends here, Sam.

35:56.355 --> 35:58.020
I can't do this.

36:22.035 --> 36:23.936
I'm so sorry.

36:28.544 --> 36:30.599
You got a life ahead of you now.

36:30.895 --> 36:32.963
It's gonna be so good.

36:33.856 --> 36:35.921
Thank you guys.

36:37.027 --> 36:39.445
Maybe we could still
stay at your place.

36:39.547 --> 36:41.632
Just 'til we find something.

37:35.211 --> 37:36.325
Pull over.

38:03.868 --> 38:05.660
OK. Let's go.

38:07.292 --> 38:08.442
Come on, Billy. Please.

38:08.491 --> 38:10.825
I'm sorry. No.

38:12.750 --> 38:15.156
Joanna, what is going on with you?

38:16.339 --> 38:17.758
You're not yourself.

38:17.855 --> 38:18.939
This is me.

38:18.988 --> 38:21.056
- Sorry, but...
- No, don't do that.

38:22.013 --> 38:23.368
You know exactly what I mean.

38:23.425 --> 38:24.576
Why won't you talk to me?

38:24.625 --> 38:26.572
- We talk every day.
- About the baby.

38:26.621 --> 38:28.672
- Stop.
- If I'm not enough,

38:28.751 --> 38:30.172
you need to tell me.

38:30.472 --> 38:31.704
If you need more,

38:31.797 --> 38:33.237
- you need to tell me.
- This isn't about you!

38:33.285 --> 38:35.251
- Can we please...
- IF YOU DON'T WANT ME,

38:35.300 --> 38:37.282
that's fine, but this baby is
coming either way.

38:37.331 --> 38:39.087
You don't think I know that?!

38:39.518 --> 38:43.340
You don't think I know
there is a person inside me?

38:43.958 --> 38:46.192
I don't know what I am doing, Billy.

38:48.784 --> 38:50.340
You...

38:51.370 --> 38:53.337
You are good.

38:54.920 --> 38:56.814
And kind.

38:57.872 --> 39:00.716
And I shouldn't even be...

39:03.350 --> 39:04.646
A marriage is one thing.

39:04.695 --> 39:07.412
We get out of contracts, all the time.

39:07.461 --> 39:10.232
But... a child?

39:11.709 --> 39:13.023
You would be...

39:13.778 --> 39:15.788
Stuck here with me,

39:15.846 --> 39:17.578
and I am clearly not

39:17.627 --> 39:19.317
capable of living this life.

39:19.635 --> 39:23.014
I can't even say "good job"
to our employees.

39:24.484 --> 39:27.555
What am I supposed to do with a child?

39:32.019 --> 39:33.854
And I just...

39:33.969 --> 39:35.559
Can't stand to see...

39:35.760 --> 39:37.218
The look of disappointment...

39:37.267 --> 39:39.047
I'm not disappointed.

39:41.257 --> 39:44.455
When I can't help
but turn our child into me.

39:49.686 --> 39:50.952
Look, I...

39:51.111 --> 39:53.117
I don't have... any answers,

39:53.166 --> 39:54.882
so I don't know what to let you in on.

39:54.931 --> 39:57.051
I am... I am...

39:59.242 --> 40:01.593
I am so confused.

40:01.820 --> 40:04.991
And I can't even trust myself, or...

40:09.687 --> 40:11.640
I am trying to figure this out.

40:12.127 --> 40:13.654
And when I do, I will let you...

40:13.703 --> 40:15.987
I DON'T WANT YOU TO FIGURE IT OUT!

40:18.585 --> 40:20.875
I wanna figure it out with you.

40:23.179 --> 40:25.007
Joanna, I don't have
the answers either.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.789
But if they exist...

40:28.069 --> 40:29.569
At all...

40:30.839 --> 40:33.249
Then I don't want to
find them without you.

40:40.561 --> 40:42.630
What the hell are we going to do?

40:45.671 --> 40:47.656
It's so nice to hear you say that.

40:55.299 --> 40:57.169
I wanna have this baby.

40:58.281 --> 41:00.281
With you.

41:07.530 --> 41:09.465
I am...

41:11.195 --> 41:13.729
I am so scared.

41:49.968 --> 41:51.554
Ready to dig in?

41:51.603 --> 41:52.824
I'll put a pot on.

41:52.880 --> 41:55.167
See if Mayor Shepherd has
some answers for us.

41:55.363 --> 41:56.607
Please.

42:07.507 --> 42:08.708
Hang up the phone!

42:08.757 --> 42:09.967
- What?
- Hang up the phone.

42:10.015 --> 42:11.211
Why?

42:11.311 --> 42:12.484
Oh, you don't think...

42:12.533 --> 42:14.210
Millwood City Hall gives the contracts

42:14.259 --> 42:15.377
to the testing facilities.

42:15.426 --> 42:18.319
Shakey said that ClearDawn
was well-connected.

42:18.455 --> 42:19.749
Do you remember the reunion?

42:19.798 --> 42:20.858
Kind of overshadowed by Kodie

42:20.907 --> 42:21.981
having her kids taken away.

42:22.030 --> 42:23.812
Do you remember
Mayor Shepherd's speech?

42:24.304 --> 42:26.476
Mercer and Shepherd are
around the same age.

42:26.525 --> 42:27.921
When she was in high school, she was...

42:27.970 --> 42:29.022
The cheerleading captain.

42:29.085 --> 42:30.218
It didn't make sense how they were

42:30.267 --> 42:31.671
operating under the radar,

42:31.720 --> 42:32.786
because they weren't.

42:32.835 --> 42:34.505
They were being protected.

42:35.021 --> 42:36.452
How many digits are there,

42:36.509 --> 42:38.429
in the account numbers
that Beckbie gave us?

42:38.478 --> 42:40.624
- Uh, 8, 15...
- 18.

42:41.259 --> 42:43.594
It's a tax receipt for a donation.

42:44.095 --> 42:45.890
They're funnelling money
through the campaign.

42:46.038 --> 42:47.273
This is bigger than Solomon.

42:47.322 --> 42:49.030
So she knows exactly what's going on.

42:49.132 --> 42:50.468
It's gonna be a stretch to prove,

42:50.517 --> 42:52.619
without actual copies
of the transactions.

42:52.798 --> 42:53.936
Or...

42:54.114 --> 42:56.772
We get the guy who created
the codenames to testify.

43:01.304 --> 43:02.398
Joanna.

43:02.447 --> 43:03.742
Beckbie. Where are you at with Mercer?

43:03.791 --> 43:05.046
I'm taking him in.

43:06.320 --> 43:07.905
Owen, we need you to wait.

43:08.085 --> 43:09.681
- We need you to...
- I'm sorry, Joanna.

43:09.730 --> 43:11.697
I've waited too long for this.

43:25.666 --> 43:27.071
OWEN!

43:28.590 --> 43:30.356
We need Sam Mercer.

43:37.294 --> 43:39.295
I'm sorry.
