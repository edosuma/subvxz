10:41.268 --> 10:43.227
<i>I was so scared.</i>

10:43.312 --> 10:45.896
<i>Mrs. Mazzanovich frightened me.</i>

10:45.981 --> 10:50.901
<i>It was her being white,

<i>When I first started to take lessons,</i>

11:48.084 --> 11:53.422

<i>and how isolated I was from the white

<i>I felt it, all the time,

were going on at that stage in her life.</i>

12:32.921 --> 12:35.922
But she did tell me about times
when she was told her nose was too big,

her lips were too full
and her skin was too dark.

12:51.147 --> 12:53.899

<i>That wasn't consciously

13:03.827 --> 13:06.119
<i>After I graduated from high school,</i>

<i>the money that had been saved
from the Eunice Waymon Fund</i>

13:09.708 --> 13:14.880
<i>sent me to New York to Juilliard
for a year and a half.</i>

<i>And then I applied for a scholarship to
Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.</i>

13:22.012 --> 13:26.348
<i>I was playing Czerny and Liszt
and Rachmaninoff and Bach.</i>

<i>I knew I was good enough,
but they turned me down,</i>

13:31.187 --> 13:36.858
<i>and it took me about six months
to realize it was because I was black.</i>

13:36.943 --> 13:43.074
<i>I never really got over
that jolt of racism at the time.</i>

13:45.702 --> 13:47.453
<i>Then the money ran out</i>

13:47.538 --> 13:50.747
<i>and the reality hit me
that I had to go to work.</i>

13:50.832 --> 13:55.877
<i>My parents had moved the whole family
to Philadelphia to be near me,</i>

13:55.962 --> 13:59.130
<i>and my family is very poor,
so I had to work.</i>

13:59.215 --> 14:00.882
<i>What else was there for me to do?</i>

14:00.967 --> 14:05.178

in Atlantic City for a summer.</i>

14:05.263 --> 14:07.766
<i>It was a very crummy bar</i>

14:08.517 --> 14:12.728
<i>and I used to go in in evening gowns.
I didn't know any better.</i>

14:12.813 --> 14:15.272
<i>And I played everything
that I could think of.</i>

14:15.357 --> 14:18.775
<i>Pop songs, classical,
spirituals, all kinds of things.</i>

14:18.860 --> 14:21.195
<i>It was very strange.</i>

14:21.280 --> 14:23.530
<i>And I had never sung before,</i>

14:23.615 --> 14:25.324
<i>and the owner came in the second night</i>

14:25.409 --> 14:28.870
<i>and told me if I wanted to keep the job,
I had to sing.</i>

14:31.748 --> 14:35.876
<i>So, $90 was more money
than I had ever heard of in my life,</i>

14:35.961 --> 14:39.214
<i>so I said, "Well, I'll sing,"
and ever since then, I've been singing.</i>

14:42.468 --> 14:46.136
ROGER NUPIE: <i>Eunice Waymon was playing</i>
<i>in the bars to support her family</i>

14:46.221 --> 14:50.891
<i>and to have money to continue
her classical piano training.</i>

14:50.976 --> 14:52.643
But since she didn't want
her mother to know that

she was playing
"the devil's music" in bars,

14:56.189 --> 14:58.815

NINA: <i>Couldn't help it.</i>

15:38.357 --> 15:41.483

AL SCHACKMAN: <i>From the beginning,</i>
<i>I felt there was something eating at her.</i>

16:06.009 --> 16:08.677
You know, "What's eating at you, Nina?"

16:08.762 --> 16:10.138
And, um...

16:11.973 --> 16:14.267
gradually that got stronger.

16:16.395 --> 16:21.107

AL: <i>The first time I played with Nina,</i>

16:34.955 --> 16:40.584
<i>it was the summer of 1957
at a restaurant in New Hope, Pennsylvania.</i>

16:40.669 --> 16:42.168
She didn't look at me.

16:42.253 --> 16:45.213
Said nothing, as though I wasn't...
I wasn't even there,

16:45.298 --> 16:48.884
<i>and started in on a song.</i>

16:48.969 --> 16:50.844
<i>She never told me
what key she was going to be in.</i>

16:50.929 --> 16:54.681
<i>She just started playing, and I knew
exactly where I was going to go with it.</i>

16:54.766 --> 16:58.477
<i>It was like we had
a telepathic relationship.</i>

16:58.562 --> 17:01.312
<i>Before you knew it,
we were just weaving in and out.</i>

17:01.397 --> 17:03.942
And then she looked up.

NINA: <i>Al Schackman</i>
<i>is a terribly sensitive, creative man.</i>

17:17.580 --> 17:19.039
<i>He has perfect pitch,</i>

17:19.124 --> 17:21.583
<i>which means that
no matter what key I'm in,</i>

17:21.667 --> 17:25.295
<i>he's able to adapt himself immediately,
'cause I do that all the time.</i>

17:25.380 --> 17:28.133
<i>I'll change the key
in the middle of a tune.</i>

17:30.677 --> 17:35.681
AL: <i>Nina had a wonderful way</i>
<i>of taking a piece of music, and...</i>

17:35.766 --> 17:40.896
not interpreting it, but...
but, like, metamorphosizing it.

17:42.105 --> 17:46.026
You know, morphing it into her experience.

17:46.818 --> 17:53.700
<i># This may only be a dream #</i>

17:54.618 --> 17:58.829
NINA: <i>What I was interested in was</i>
<i>conveying an emotional message,</i>

17:58.914 --> 18:01.457
<i>which means using
everything you've got inside you</i>

18:01.542 --> 18:03.792
<i>sometimes to barely make a note</i>

18:03.877 --> 18:06.377
<i>or if you have to strain to sing,
you sing.</i>

18:06.462 --> 18:08.922
<i>So sometimes I sound like gravel,</i>

18:09.007 --> 18:12.092
<i>and sometimes
I sound like coffee and cream.</i>

18:12.177 --> 18:19.100
<i># So baby, love me, love me tonight #</i>

18:23.021 --> 18:29.945
<i># Tomorrow was made for some #</i>

GEORGE WEIN: <i>When I first saw Nina</i>
<i>at my club in 1959,</i>

18:38.036 --> 18:40.370
<i>I was impressed. She was different.</i>

18:40.455 --> 18:43.248
She mixed in folk music with jazz.

18:43.333 --> 18:45.542
She played very fine piano.

18:45.627 --> 18:49.087
<i>Her voice was totally different
from anybody else.</i>

18:49.172 --> 18:53.301
<i>It was a woman's voice,
but it had the depth of a baritone.</i>

18:54.219 --> 19:00.141
<i>That depth and that darkness carried
the insight of what was in Nina's soul...</i>

19:01.142 --> 19:03.393
and it reached you very quickly.

19:03.478 --> 19:10.401
<i># For all... #</i>

19:19.077 --> 19:25.081
<i># ...we know #</i>

19:25.166 --> 19:29.044
<i>She was an artist.
She was an original artist.</i>

19:29.129 --> 19:33.298
So we paid attention, and in 1960,
I put her on the Newport Jazz Festival,

19:33.383 --> 19:35.886
<i>and she was a hit there.</i>

20:06.708 --> 20:09.250

Nina came to the table and sat,
and I was eating a hamburger plate,

24:04.529 --> 24:07.738
and there were fries,
and she dipped into them.

24:07.823 --> 24:10.116

I said, "All right."

<i>We got cute and then she gave me
that card with a note on it.</i>

<i>Andy Stroud was to be your husband</i>

out for a date or something else?</i>

24:45.778 --> 24:48.654
[NINA LAUGHS] <i>That's a hard question.</i>

24:48.739 --> 24:52.283

wanted to meet me for a long time.</i>

24:52.368 --> 24:54.995
<i>And he had come for me.
I fell in love with him.</i>

<i>Then later, he scared me to death.
He was so, you know...</i>

25:00.001 --> 25:03.794
<i>He knew what he wanted
and he just took over.</i>

25:03.879 --> 25:06.506
<i># With you forever #</i>

25:06.591 --> 25:10.176
<i>He abandoned his own career
