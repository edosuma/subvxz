<i>Previously on "Switched at Birth"</i>

00:02.033 --> 00:03.567
I don't always wanna wonder if

00:03.601 --> 00:05.502
we missed out on something really good

00:05.537 --> 00:07.304
<i>because we were too scared.</i>

00:08.640 --> 00:09.606
What the hell is this?

00:09.641 --> 00:11.308
No way.

00:11.342 --> 00:13.502
This guy better watch out
that I don't find him, man.

00:13.503 --> 00:14.344
It's on now.

00:14.379 --> 00:16.099
Huh?! You're not gonna
diss my work again!

00:16.100 --> 00:17.460
- Get out of here!
- Crazy bitch!

00:17.461 --> 00:20.184
One thing, your honor. We seek
leave to amend our witness list

00:20.218 --> 00:21.318
to include one more witness

00:21.352 --> 00:22.536
Kathryn Kennish.

00:23.421 --> 00:25.055
Ever since we found out about the switch

00:25.089 --> 00:27.825
it has been one thing after another!

00:27.859 --> 00:28.859
And we're done.

00:28.893 --> 00:29.993
Yeah, I got it.

00:30.028 --> 00:31.929
<i>( Door knocks )</i>

Hey.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.255
So they wants us at the trial again

00:58.289 --> 00:59.289

00:59.324 --> 01:00.390
I don't mind.

( Giggling )

01:08.099 --> 01:10.767
Did you see all the
decorations Kathryn put up?

01:10.802 --> 01:12.703
It's like a pumpkin threw up in there.

01:12.737 --> 01:14.938
I know, right? ( Chuckles )

01:18.517 --> 01:19.877
What are you doing tomorrow night?

01:19.911 --> 01:22.613
I mean, you don't have to work, do you?

01:22.647 --> 01:25.716
Yeah, the restaurant's doing
this whole pumpkin menu

01:25.750 --> 01:27.718
<i>and the waiters are dressing up.</i>

01:27.752 --> 01:30.487
- It should be fun.
- <i>( Cellphone vibrates )</i>

01:34.592 --> 01:36.326
Am I interrupting?

01:36.361 --> 01:38.428
Sorry. It's just
someone from work.

01:38.463 --> 01:41.198
You really love this job, don't you?

01:42.367 --> 01:44.101
Yeah. I do.

01:48.306 --> 01:50.040
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:50.074 --> 01:51.909
Pump-tastic.

01:51.943 --> 01:52.943
Thanks.

01:52.977 --> 01:54.111
We feast tonight.

01:54.145 --> 01:55.812
Nice!

01:57.181 --> 01:58.682
Hot dogs, chips

01:58.716 --> 01:59.950
and beer.

02:01.119 --> 02:02.920
And...

02:02.954 --> 02:03.921
My dad called.

02:03.955 --> 02:05.889
No kidding!

02:05.924 --> 02:07.724
Dude, I was kinda freaked out at first

02:07.759 --> 02:09.526
'cause I haven't heard
from him in forever.

02:09.561 --> 02:11.461
I thought he was in Morocco.

02:11.496 --> 02:12.629
Turns out, he's in Mexico.

02:12.664 --> 02:13.984
Oh. Well,
it starts with an "M."

02:13.985 --> 02:15.399
Yeah. So,

02:15.433 --> 02:17.592
you know that street
artist named Jr, right?

02:17.593 --> 02:20.273
Yeah, the French dude who covered
the, uh... the rooftops in Kenya

02:20.274 --> 02:22.394
- with like, the vinyl posters.
- The vinyl posters!

02:22.395 --> 02:23.275
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Okay.

02:23.276 --> 02:24.308
So my dad heard

02:24.342 --> 02:26.176
he's heading down to Mexico
for a new piece.

02:26.210 --> 02:28.450
No one knows what exactly,
but him and a bunch of dudes

02:28.451 --> 02:30.531
are gonna go down there
and try to be a part of it.

02:30.532 --> 02:31.412
You should totally go.

02:31.416 --> 02:33.116
Oh, I am. This Christmas.

02:33.151 --> 02:34.985
Just gotta get some money.

02:35.019 --> 02:37.154
After you pay me back.

02:37.188 --> 02:39.022
Mm. After I pay you back.

02:39.057 --> 02:40.090
( Both chuckling )

02:40.124 --> 02:41.091
( Cellphone ringing )

02:42.860 --> 02:44.027
Ignore it. Just keep going.

02:45.763 --> 02:47.963
So I was thinking of stopping
in Austin for a few days

02:47.964 --> 02:49.684
- on my way there.
- <i>( Cellphone ringing )</i>

02:49.685 --> 02:49.925
And...

02:52.898 --> 02:54.898
that's like the third time
she called in an hour.

02:54.899 --> 02:55.739
<i>( Ringing continues )</i>

02:55.740 --> 02:58.100
You should pick up or her next
call's gonna be the police.

02:59.711 --> 03:00.677
Hello.

03:00.712 --> 03:03.547
Bay? Sweetie?

03:03.581 --> 03:05.682
Hi.<i>Oh, honey.</i>

03:05.717 --> 03:07.351
When are you gonna come home?

03:08.519 --> 03:11.154
I'm not sure exactly.

03:11.189 --> 03:13.189
( Whispers ) What's she saying?
I wanna hear what

03:13.190 --> 03:14.024
<i>she's saying.</i>

03:14.058 --> 03:15.392
Uh. If you just come home

03:15.426 --> 03:17.260
we could talk this all through.

03:17.295 --> 03:19.229
Is dad there?

03:19.263 --> 03:20.698
No.

03:20.699 --> 03:22.659
( Loudly ) Ask her where
the hell she's staying.

03:22.660 --> 03:23.780
He is there. I can hear him.

03:23.781 --> 03:26.236
Yeah. Well, we just
want you home here with us.

03:30.141 --> 03:33.610
Doesn't exactly sound
like dad wants me home.

03:33.645 --> 03:34.845
But you know that's not true.

03:34.879 --> 03:36.680
Would you stop treating her
with kid gloves?

03:36.714 --> 03:37.948
I am dealing with it, John!

03:37.982 --> 03:39.783
You know what? I gotta go.

03:39.817 --> 03:41.918
Now Bay, I...

03:41.953 --> 03:43.587
Bay?

03:45.490 --> 03:46.690
They bugging you to go home?

03:46.724 --> 03:48.392
Yeah. My mom's
just worried that

03:48.426 --> 03:50.181
the neighbors are gonna start gossiping

03:50.182 --> 03:52.262
and my dad just wants me
home so he can yell at me.

03:53.431 --> 03:54.598
So stick with me for a while.

03:57.335 --> 03:58.335
You know, I think I will.

04:07.078 --> 04:08.912
Are you Daphne?

04:08.946 --> 04:10.881
Yes.

04:10.915 --> 04:12.082
I'm Michelle Natterson.

04:12.116 --> 04:13.083
The owner.

04:13.117 --> 04:14.851
Oh! Hi!

04:14.886 --> 04:17.046
- It's nice to meet you.
- I'd like to speak with you

04:17.047 --> 04:18.988
about your relationship
with Jeff Reycraft.

04:20.825 --> 04:21.791
Okay.

04:21.826 --> 04:23.627
Mm. Not here.

04:23.661 --> 04:24.928
Is there a problem?

04:24.962 --> 04:26.863
Well, I don't know yet.

04:26.898 --> 04:27.864
Can you follow me?

04:27.899 --> 04:29.666
Of course.

04:43.614 --> 04:44.681
What's that?

04:44.716 --> 04:46.683
Uh, I means that you
can do whatever you want,

04:46.718 --> 04:48.518
you don't have to listen to your parents.

04:48.553 --> 04:49.619
Oh. Sounds cool.

04:49.654 --> 04:51.555
Yeah, this girl at Buckner did it

04:51.589 --> 04:54.424
so she could go to Paris
and become a model.

04:54.459 --> 04:55.939
So you just have to go before a judge

04:55.940 --> 04:58.428
and prove that you
are better off without them.

04:58.463 --> 05:00.597
Damn. In my world,
people just run away.

05:00.631 --> 05:03.600

out wherever you are!</i>

05:03.634 --> 05:04.668
<i>( Pounding on door )</i>

Trick or treat.

05:12.376 --> 05:13.510
What are we gonna do?

05:13.544 --> 05:16.413
Not inside? Damn!

05:16.447 --> 05:18.381
Let's check over there.

Get away from the window!
Get back, get back!

Smak: <i>Zarra!</i>

05:22.687 --> 05:25.276
- They're looking in every trailer.
- Shh shh, quiet.

05:25.277 --> 05:26.757
- What are you doing?
- Calling 911.

05:26.758 --> 05:28.558
- No no, you can't!
- <i>( Pounding continues )</i>

05:28.559 --> 05:30.768
They're gonna arrest us all like
they did last time, all right?

05:30.769 --> 05:32.329
It's not like I pay rent on this thing.

05:32.330 --> 05:34.570
- We should make a run for it.
- No no. It's too risky.

05:34.571 --> 05:35.931
Okay. Well,
what are we gonna do?

05:35.965 --> 05:37.925
We're just gonna lay low.
Maybe they'll miss us.

05:37.926 --> 05:38.886
Yeah, and if they don't?

05:44.342 --> 05:45.642
Smak: <i>Zarra!</i>

05:45.676 --> 05:47.644
<i>Come out, come out, wherever you are.</i>

05:49.680 --> 05:51.000
Michelle:
There have been rumors

05:51.001 --> 05:53.550
that Mr. Reycraft
is having an inappropriate

05:53.584 --> 05:56.453
relationship with one of the employees.

05:56.487 --> 05:59.289
Now we take this very seriously.

05:59.323 --> 06:01.458
Our lawyer is conducting
a formal investigation...

06:01.492 --> 06:03.460
- lawyer?
- But I need to know

06:03.494 --> 06:06.429
right now just how big a problem I've got.

06:08.366 --> 06:10.333
I'm having trouble following you.

06:10.368 --> 06:11.968
I really should wait for an interpreter.

06:11.969 --> 06:15.272
You won't be fired for telling the truth.

06:15.306 --> 06:16.586
And if you are being victimized,

06:16.587 --> 06:18.275
Jeff can't hurt you, I promise.

06:18.309 --> 06:19.476
I'm not being victimized!

06:19.510 --> 06:22.379
Chef is my boss. That's it.

06:22.413 --> 06:23.446
Daphne,

06:23.481 --> 06:25.582
you were promoted from dishwasher

06:25.616 --> 06:28.418
to <i>garde manger very quickly.</i>

06:28.452 --> 06:30.274
Because I did my job

06:30.275 --> 06:31.755
and helped everyone else with theirs.

06:31.789 --> 06:33.590
Did Jeff promise you promotion

06:33.624 --> 06:35.592
in return for sexual favors?

06:35.626 --> 06:36.660
No!

06:36.694 --> 06:38.762
Did you and chef

06:38.796 --> 06:41.598
have a romantic relationship?

06:41.632 --> 06:43.433
Or do you now?

06:45.536 --> 06:46.503
No.

06:49.407 --> 06:51.341
Did chef ask you to say that?

06:51.375 --> 06:53.343
No. Look...

06:53.377 --> 06:55.312
There was an employee who asked me out

06:55.346 --> 06:56.413
and I turned him down

06:56.447 --> 06:58.315
and on the same day he got fired

06:58.349 --> 07:00.350
for making a huge mistake in the kitchen.

07:00.384 --> 07:03.286
I think that may have
something to do with this.

07:03.321 --> 07:05.455
Is chef in trouble?

07:05.489 --> 07:08.491
I'm just gathering information.

07:08.526 --> 07:11.261
But once I get to the bottom of this,

07:11.295 --> 07:14.598
I will take whatever
action needs to be taken.

07:17.501 --> 07:20.303
Bay: <i>Think they left?</i>

07:20.338 --> 07:21.538
Zarra: <i>I don't know.</i>

07:21.572 --> 07:23.540
What if they're waiting for us?

07:30.481 --> 07:32.616

07:34.418 --> 07:36.286
( Exhales ) It's my brother.

07:39.390 --> 07:40.870
Hey, got your text.
Here's your bag.

07:41.559 --> 07:42.692
Hey, where's you car?

07:42.727 --> 07:44.007
Uh, it's around the corner, why?

07:44.008 --> 07:45.295
'Cause we have to go now.

07:46.364 --> 07:47.397
What? Is something wrong?

07:47.431 --> 07:48.498
Go go. Shh, quiet.

07:48.532 --> 07:49.532
They might still be here.

07:49.533 --> 07:50.567
<i>Who might still be here?</i>

07:54.438 --> 07:55.472
Smak: There they are!

- Ah! Come on!
- Go go go go go go!

07:56.947 --> 07:58.308
- Go go go go!
- Go go go!

07:58.342 --> 08:00.410
- <i>Toby, hurry up!</i>
<i>- Come on, get in the car!</i>

08:00.444 --> 08:01.964
Bay: <i>Unlock it,</i>
<i>unlock it, unlock it!</i>

08:01.965 --> 08:03.280
( Car beeps ) <i>Open it! Open it!</i>

08:03.314 --> 08:04.381
Hit it twice! Hurry up!

08:04.415 --> 08:05.715
- I'm trying!
- Come on!

08:05.750 --> 08:07.250
Go! Go go go!

08:07.285 --> 08:08.645
Let's go!
Let's get her, come on!

08:08.646 --> 08:10.453
Come on, come on, come on.

08:10.488 --> 08:11.554
Come on, come on. Get in.

08:11.589 --> 08:13.356
Zarra: Go go go!
Close it, close it!

08:13.391 --> 08:15.091
Go! Go go go go go!

08:36.224 --> 08:37.624
Whatever you do, please do not tell

08:37.625 --> 08:39.092
mom and dad what just happened.

08:39.126 --> 08:41.796
What? The Friday the 13th
sequel that just happened?

08:43.999 --> 08:45.966
- Bay!
- Hi.

08:46.001 --> 08:47.802
( Sternly ) Bay.

08:47.836 --> 08:49.103
We need to talk.

08:49.137 --> 08:50.771
- Hey.
- In private.

08:58.747 --> 08:59.680
Parents love me.

09:03.285 --> 09:04.685
I texted you that I was at Zarra's.

09:04.686 --> 09:05.519
A great comfort.

09:05.554 --> 09:06.654
You know what?

09:06.688 --> 09:08.622
You clearly do not want me here.

09:08.657 --> 09:11.225
What we do not want
is you stealing and lying.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.426
I said I was sorry.

09:12.461 --> 09:14.161
Stop it! Both of you!

09:14.196 --> 09:15.596
We know you want your independence,

09:15.597 --> 09:16.924
but you're still a minor

09:16.925 --> 09:18.365
<i>and we're still responsible for you.</i>

09:18.400 --> 09:20.067
We don't know where Zarra lives.

09:20.102 --> 09:21.302
We've never met her parents...

09:21.303 --> 09:22.837
she's 19, mom. Not nine.

09:22.871 --> 09:24.431
Don't talk to your mother in that tone.

09:24.432 --> 09:25.739
We wanna make sure

09:25.774 --> 09:27.908
that you're safe
and making good decisions.

09:27.943 --> 09:29.777
And based on what's been happening lately,

09:29.811 --> 09:32.012
can you honestly blame us
for being concerned?

09:33.582 --> 09:34.615
Okay, you're right.

09:34.649 --> 09:35.583
I am sorry.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.520
And now I'm wondering
if Zarra and I can crash here.

09:39.554 --> 09:41.489
"Crash here"? You live here!

09:41.523 --> 09:43.683
- As for that girl, I don't care...
- She has a name!

09:43.684 --> 09:45.858
- And you know what it is.
- <i>( Door opens )</i>

09:46.495 --> 09:47.628
I just stopped by to

09:47.662 --> 09:50.397
drop off Angelo's shirt for court.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.334
Regina.

09:53.368 --> 09:54.728
Can my friend Zarra stay with you?

09:54.729 --> 09:57.071
- No, she cannot!
- I was asking about Regina's house.

09:57.105 --> 09:59.440
That is my house. This is my house.
I say no!

09:59.474 --> 10:00.407
- John?!
- What?!

10:00.442 --> 10:01.408
( Groans loudly )

10:01.443 --> 10:03.144
What did that accomplish?

10:03.178 --> 10:04.945
We need to be her parents!

10:04.980 --> 10:06.947
- I'm trying to be her mother!
- <i>( Door closes )</i>

10:09.050 --> 10:11.152
How can you just let him
talk to you like that?

10:11.186 --> 10:13.154
"This is my house.
That is my house."

10:13.188 --> 10:14.221
Okay, he's upset

10:14.256 --> 10:16.190
and he's got a lot on his plate right now.

10:16.224 --> 10:18.125
He's always upset!

10:18.160 --> 10:20.040
You probably won't
believe this, but sometimes

10:20.041 --> 10:22.830
growing up is harder on the
parents than it is the kids.

10:22.864 --> 10:25.533
I'm sorry, are you taking his side?

10:25.567 --> 10:27.367
I don't wanna get in
the middle of this, but

10:27.368 --> 10:28.769
I can see where he's coming from.

10:28.803 --> 10:30.804
Wow. They are always
fighting with you

10:30.839 --> 10:32.573
to be parents to Daphne, but with me,

10:32.607 --> 10:34.542
you're just willing
to let them run the show.

10:34.576 --> 10:35.709
Bay!

10:38.313 --> 10:39.246
( Sighs )

10:43.519 --> 10:45.519
Your dad got a problem
with all of Bay's friends?

10:45.554 --> 10:48.455
Only the ones that live
in abandoned trailer parks

10:48.490 --> 10:50.324
and get chased by scary angry guys.

10:52.093 --> 10:53.333
It's good for hot house flowers

10:53.334 --> 10:55.930
to get some exposure to the real world.

10:55.964 --> 10:57.932
Especially if they want to create art.

11:00.168 --> 11:01.135
I don't know you

11:01.169 --> 11:03.170
and I have nothing against you.

11:03.205 --> 11:05.673
But I don't want anything
bad to happen to Bay.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.942
I don't want anything bad
to happen to her either.

11:07.976 --> 11:08.943
Hey.

11:10.979 --> 11:13.881
You can't stay and I have to.

11:13.915 --> 11:14.882
I'm so sorry.

11:14.916 --> 11:16.717
Yeah, I could kinda hear from the yelling.

11:16.751 --> 11:18.552
It's cool.

11:18.587 --> 11:20.387
I'm gonna stay with
eight ball for a while.

11:20.422 --> 11:21.662
He's on his way to come get me.

11:21.663 --> 11:23.591
What about the trailer?

11:23.625 --> 11:25.526
Eight ball he went
by there a little while ago

11:25.560 --> 11:28.362
and Smak and his crew
are still there... waiting.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.231
Well, what about your stuff?

11:31.499 --> 11:33.968
Well, it may not be my stuff anymore.

11:35.270 --> 11:36.303
See ya.

11:43.078 --> 11:44.245
What'd you tell her?

11:44.279 --> 11:45.779
Nothing. I swear.

11:45.814 --> 11:47.114
I mean, who else knows?

11:47.148 --> 11:48.882
( Stammering ) Uh, did melody report us?

11:48.917 --> 11:49.917
Did you tell your mom?

11:49.951 --> 11:51.585
Could you please slow down?

11:51.620 --> 11:54.722
What'd she say? You know what?
Let me guess.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.636
( Amicably ) "Don't worry.
We're on your side.

11:56.637 --> 11:57.997
You can tell us
anything." Right?

11:57.998 --> 12:00.582
( Scoffs ) Of course.
To me, it was all...

12:00.583 --> 12:02.463
( Harshly ) "Word gets
out that you were fired

12:02.464 --> 12:04.704
for carrying on with an
employee, you'll be lucky to be

12:04.705 --> 12:06.105
flipping burgers
at white castle."

12:06.106 --> 12:07.401
You're talking too fast again.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.403
God, this is a disaster!
You know that, right?

12:09.437 --> 12:11.797
You know how many years could've
just gone down the drain?

12:11.798 --> 12:12.539
I'm such an idiot.

12:12.574 --> 12:15.109
It's gonna be fine. I promise.

12:15.143 --> 12:17.044
Yeah.

12:17.078 --> 12:18.045
Sure it is.

12:28.032 --> 12:28.998
Hey.

12:29.033 --> 12:31.628
You're leaving already?

12:31.629 --> 12:32.669
Yeah, sorry. I texted you.

12:32.670 --> 12:33.950
Can you get a ride to the court?

12:33.985 --> 12:35.225
Of course. Where are you going?

12:35.226 --> 12:36.546
Uh, taking my mom to the pharmacy

12:36.547 --> 12:37.640
and just a quick errand.

12:37.675 --> 12:38.675
I will see you there.

12:38.709 --> 12:40.743
- Does this errand have a name?
- Yeah.

12:40.778 --> 12:43.313
The clear path employment agency.

12:43.347 --> 12:45.181
Oh, you finally quit that salon?

12:45.215 --> 12:46.182
<i>No. Some of us</i>

12:46.216 --> 12:48.217
actually try to avoid unemployment.

12:48.252 --> 12:49.185
Ma.

12:50.421 --> 12:52.501
Geraldo said that if I'm
not back cutting hair soon

12:52.502 --> 12:54.142
he's gonna rent my chair to someone else.

12:54.143 --> 12:55.858
I'm sorry.

12:55.893 --> 12:57.026
Yeah. Well, I can't get mad.

12:57.061 --> 12:58.227
I mean, I get it.

12:58.262 --> 12:59.762
- Shouldn't we get going?
- Regina.

12:59.797 --> 13:01.130
If things get tough, you know?

13:01.165 --> 13:03.733
What? You'll take care of her
with the carpentry job you quit?

13:03.767 --> 13:04.734
Ma!

13:04.768 --> 13:06.636
I'm just saying.

13:06.670 --> 13:08.310
Things could be different for you and me.

13:08.311 --> 13:09.038
After this trial.

13:10.541 --> 13:11.941
Don't get ahead of yourself.

13:11.976 --> 13:13.910
( Sighs )

13:15.679 --> 13:17.380
I'll see you later.

14:33.190 --> 14:34.157
Hey.

14:42.066 --> 14:42.999
Yeah.

14:49.673 --> 14:50.740
Uh. With a friend.

14:56.713 --> 14:59.782
Uh. Just giving
some stuff away.

15:08.459 --> 15:11.194
Daphne got the camera back to you, right?

15:21.972 --> 15:23.139
It was no big deal.

15:30.714 --> 15:31.714
Are you a cop now?

15:34.918 --> 15:37.854
Well, you don't need
to worry about me anymore.

15:37.888 --> 15:39.822
It's not your job.

15:39.857 --> 15:41.824
I gotta go.

15:41.859 --> 15:43.659
<i>( Car engine starting )</i>

15:55.339 --> 15:56.305
<i>( Door opens )</i>

16:00.210 --> 16:01.210
Hey.

16:01.245 --> 16:03.045
What's wrong?

16:03.080 --> 16:04.347
Nothing.

16:06.083 --> 16:07.363
You're not telling me something.

16:07.364 --> 16:07.984
What is it?

16:10.787 --> 16:12.989
I tried to fix something.

16:13.023 --> 16:15.124
But I think I made it worse.

16:15.159 --> 16:17.693
Well, made what worse?

16:17.728 --> 16:20.930
Jeff... chef... my boss.

16:23.500 --> 16:24.667
Things were going so great

16:24.701 --> 16:26.402
and then the owner called me in

16:26.436 --> 16:27.703
to interrogate me about him.

16:27.738 --> 16:29.672
Wh... the owner called you in?

16:29.706 --> 16:33.342
And now Jeff is so mad at me.

16:33.377 --> 16:34.577
Are you gonna lose your job?

16:34.611 --> 16:36.279
I already quit.

16:36.313 --> 16:39.382
Quit?! Why...
why would you quit?

16:39.416 --> 16:41.050
I had to.

16:41.084 --> 16:43.052
We couldn't be together
if I was working for him

16:43.073 --> 16:44.353
and he couldn't quit, obviously.

16:44.388 --> 16:45.922
Wait wait wait.

16:45.956 --> 16:47.924
Be together?

16:47.958 --> 16:49.926
Are you...

16:50.994 --> 16:52.028
Seeing Jeff?

16:53.163 --> 16:54.283
You just had a crush on him.

16:54.284 --> 16:55.765
He was just dating melody.

16:55.799 --> 16:56.732
I know he's older

16:56.767 --> 16:58.601
and I know he's my boss,

16:58.635 --> 17:00.570
but it doesn't matter.

17:00.604 --> 17:02.844
He's pressuring you to give
up something that you love?

17:02.845 --> 17:05.645
Have you forgotten how hard it is
to find a job working in a kitchen?

17:05.646 --> 17:07.710
He's not pressuring me!
I did that myself.

17:07.743 --> 17:09.377
I thought you would be supportive.

17:09.413 --> 17:10.445
Why would I be supportive

17:10.480 --> 17:12.682
of you dating somebody
so totally inappropriate?

17:12.715 --> 17:14.876
Because frankly, mom, you're
not exactly a role model

17:14.877 --> 17:16.285
for choosing great men!

17:19.455 --> 17:21.123
You need to march back in there,

17:21.157 --> 17:23.025
dump this guy and get your job back.

17:23.060 --> 17:25.094
You're not listening to me.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.230
I want him more than I want the job!

17:27.263 --> 17:28.304
Is that what I taught you?

17:28.332 --> 17:31.033
To give up everything that
you care about for a man?

17:31.068 --> 17:33.035
That he is more important?

17:33.070 --> 17:34.630
You must have learned that from Kathryn

17:34.631 --> 17:36.031
because you did not get it from me!

17:38.775 --> 17:40.676
- Damn it. Daphne...
- Regina, Daphne.

17:40.711 --> 17:41.777
They're ready for us.

17:42.980 --> 17:43.946
I'm sorry.

17:48.919 --> 17:50.453
God.

17:50.487 --> 17:52.622
So we're all here, Bay.

17:52.656 --> 17:54.624
Please, just call me back
when you get this.

17:56.493 --> 17:57.493
Still nothing?

17:57.527 --> 17:58.847
I can't believe she's doing this.

17:58.848 --> 17:59.662
Today of all days.

17:59.696 --> 18:01.631
Well, sweetie. We have to go in.
Are you okay?

18:01.665 --> 18:03.366
God, no! Just when
I thought she couldn't

18:03.400 --> 18:05.167
piss me off any more.

18:06.403 --> 18:07.436
Everything all right?

18:07.471 --> 18:09.505
Yeah, it's fine.
We'll see you inside.

18:09.539 --> 18:12.275
If you need anything
from me, just let me know.

18:17.848 --> 18:19.181
That was supposed to be our life.

18:24.221 --> 18:26.856
I wrote the book to try and
make sense of what happened.

18:26.890 --> 18:28.924
And make a little money along the way?

18:28.959 --> 18:31.694
I'm donating all the profits
to a children's charity.

18:31.728 --> 18:34.530
Because you didn't exactly need
the money yourself, did you?

18:34.564 --> 18:35.898
Objection.

18:35.932 --> 18:37.533
Sustained.

18:37.567 --> 18:38.701
<i>Mrs. Kennish,</i>

18:38.735 --> 18:41.504
who is Brizia Muñoz?

18:41.538 --> 18:45.241
She's a nurse who worked in
the nursery at the hospital

18:45.275 --> 18:47.176
the night that Bay
and Daphne were switched.

18:47.210 --> 18:48.770
And you gave her money too, didn't you?

18:48.771 --> 18:50.046
Yes.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.415
To pay her to testify on your behalf

18:52.449 --> 18:56.085
about how poorly the hospital
treated its employees?

18:56.119 --> 18:58.421
<i>No. She was gonna</i>
<i>testify on our behalf,</i>

18:58.455 --> 19:02.091
but she changed her mind
when she lost her job.

19:02.125 --> 19:05.861
I just lent her some money
till she found a new job.

19:05.896 --> 19:07.229
You're a very generous woman.

19:07.264 --> 19:09.098
Giving your profits to charity,

19:09.132 --> 19:10.966
lending money to somebody you hardly know.

19:12.869 --> 19:14.704
It was the right thing to do.

19:14.738 --> 19:16.906
And on page 122 of your book,

19:16.940 --> 19:19.709
didn't you say that because of the

19:19.743 --> 19:22.511
switch you, quote...

19:22.546 --> 19:25.648
"Feel blessed to have been given
more than I ever wanted."

19:25.682 --> 19:27.383
End quote.

19:28.552 --> 19:29.618
<i>I was reunited</i>

19:29.653 --> 19:32.188
with the daughter I gave birth to.

19:32.222 --> 19:34.390
That's a blessing.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.525
Calston: <i>So why are we here?</i>

19:36.560 --> 19:39.061
- Excuse me?
- Why are we troubling

19:39.096 --> 19:41.063
the good ladies and gentlemen of this jury

19:41.098 --> 19:42.998
to hear your suit for damages

19:43.033 --> 19:44.333
when, in fact,

19:44.368 --> 19:46.202
by your own account, your life

19:46.236 --> 19:49.138
has been made better,
not worse, by the switch.

19:49.172 --> 19:50.172
Objection!

19:50.207 --> 19:52.808
Uh, no. I want to answer that.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.143
Overruled.

19:57.114 --> 20:00.583
I went to that hospital to have my baby.

20:00.617 --> 20:03.753
I came home with a baby that wasn't mine.

20:05.489 --> 20:06.889
<i>Do you realize how devastated I am?</i>

20:06.890 --> 20:09.625
(Voice breaking) To know that the life

20:09.659 --> 20:13.362
that I brought into this world

20:13.397 --> 20:15.531
was cared for and nurtured...

20:15.565 --> 20:18.401
By someone I didn't even know?

20:22.472 --> 20:24.306
I missed 16 years.

20:26.209 --> 20:27.343
The baby years.

20:29.379 --> 20:33.182
All those times when Daphne was hurt

20:33.216 --> 20:34.316
I wasn't there for her.

20:36.052 --> 20:37.219
All those little moments,

20:38.922 --> 20:41.090
all those memories together...

20:43.660 --> 20:44.693
I missed.

20:49.866 --> 20:50.800
We missed.

20:55.572 --> 20:56.772
I'll never get over that.

20:58.708 --> 21:00.309
Never.

21:00.343 --> 21:02.611
So let me get this straight?

21:02.646 --> 21:04.647
What you're saying is,

21:04.681 --> 21:07.583
if you could go back
in time and undo the switch,

21:07.617 --> 21:09.318
you would.

21:09.352 --> 21:11.520
You mean, and never know Bay?

21:11.555 --> 21:13.155
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

21:13.190 --> 21:14.323
In a parallel universe,

21:14.357 --> 21:16.325
<i>where the switch never happened,</i>

21:16.359 --> 21:17.993
you wouldn't be the mother to Bay.

21:18.028 --> 21:19.028
That's what you want?!

21:19.062 --> 21:20.129
Objection!

21:20.163 --> 21:21.297
Overruled.

21:21.331 --> 21:24.200
No. No. Of course not.

21:24.234 --> 21:25.801
No.

21:25.836 --> 21:28.070
You wouldn't want to undo the switch?

21:31.708 --> 21:32.842
( Quietly ) No.

21:35.679 --> 21:36.612
I wouldn't.

21:37.747 --> 21:39.482
No further questions.

21:39.516 --> 21:41.417
Kathryn: <i>But...</i>

21:46.690 --> 21:47.656
( sighs deeply )

21:53.294 --> 21:53.864
Hey.

21:55.171 --> 21:56.371
Dude, what are you doing here?

21:56.372 --> 21:58.348
Don't you have your big court thing?

21:58.437 --> 22:00.915
I was on my way, but then
I got to thinking...

22:01.323 --> 22:02.904
Jr is a legend.

22:03.131 --> 22:05.502
And a chance to work with
him may never come again.

22:06.779 --> 22:07.145
Okay.

22:07.179 --> 22:08.906
I wanna come.

22:10.101 --> 22:11.083
Seriously?

22:11.435 --> 22:12.035
Let's go.

22:12.069 --> 22:13.900
- What, now?
- Why not?

22:15.095 --> 22:17.579
Look, we could stay here
and we could deal with Smak

22:17.610 --> 22:20.269
and all this other B.S.
Or we could just go.

22:21.161 --> 22:23.268
Kinda wanna meet papa Zarra.

22:23.302 --> 22:24.235
( Exhales )

22:25.737 --> 22:27.138
Let's go to Mexico.

22:27.173 --> 22:28.173
( Chuckles )

22:28.207 --> 22:30.141
What, that's it?
You don't need anything?

22:30.176 --> 22:31.776
No, dude. I'm good.

22:33.846 --> 22:34.879
Let's roll.

22:34.914 --> 22:36.014
Ha!

22:36.048 --> 22:37.949
<i>( Engine starting )</i>

22:46.827 --> 22:48.827
Now Daphne probably thinks
that I don't want her.

22:48.861 --> 22:50.821
Sweetie, what you said
about Daphne doesn't mean

22:50.822 --> 22:52.564
you love her any less.
She knows that.

22:52.598 --> 22:54.198
Look, I know I shouldn't have said that,

22:54.199 --> 22:55.366
but how could I lie?

22:55.401 --> 22:58.636
How could I say I wished
I'd never raised Bay?

22:58.671 --> 23:00.711
- Sweetie, it's fine.
- Yeah, but now the hospital

23:00.712 --> 23:04.209
can say that we weren't really
harmed by the switch, right?

23:04.243 --> 23:06.578
Well, hopefully the jury
was as moved by your testimony

23:06.612 --> 23:08.213
<i>as the rest of us were.</i>

23:08.247 --> 23:10.315
Anything can happen.
Just sit tight.

23:12.144 --> 23:14.345
Has anybody heard from Bay?
Have you heard from Bay?

23:14.379 --> 23:15.346
No.

23:18.116 --> 23:19.216
What is he doing here?

23:19.251 --> 23:20.952
I got desperate. I texted him.

23:20.986 --> 23:23.106
- I thought maybe...
- You didn't think she would...

23:23.107 --> 23:23.507
would she?

23:25.824 --> 23:27.024
Hi.

23:29.161 --> 23:30.995
Have you heard from Bay?

23:40.672 --> 23:42.072
He said her saw her this morning...

23:42.073 --> 23:44.508
- I actually think I got most of that.
- What?!

23:44.543 --> 23:46.383
You what the truth is,
she's probably at home

23:46.384 --> 23:47.704
painting horrible pictures of me.

23:47.705 --> 23:48.545
But the good news is,

23:48.547 --> 23:50.314
I'm tracking her phone with this.

23:50.349 --> 23:52.516
And I can tell you exactly where she is.

23:52.551 --> 23:54.118
Which is in...

23:54.152 --> 23:56.053
- ( Cellphone beeps )
- Oklahoma?!

23:56.088 --> 23:57.021
What is she doing

23:57.055 --> 23:58.155
in Oklahoma?

23:58.190 --> 24:01.325
I know Zarra's dad lives in Mexico.

24:01.360 --> 24:02.960
- Mexico?
- Oh, God.

24:02.995 --> 24:04.829
Okay, I'm going after her.

24:06.098 --> 24:07.031
You're coming... no no.

24:07.065 --> 24:08.065
You are not coming.

24:08.100 --> 24:09.967
John?

24:10.002 --> 24:11.102
Let him go.

24:13.972 --> 24:15.673
I'll stay with mom.

24:15.707 --> 24:16.941
Fine.

24:16.975 --> 24:18.876
Call me as soon as you know anything.

24:24.716 --> 24:27.351
Frida Kahlo's house is in
Coyoacan, which I've been

24:27.386 --> 24:29.387
dying to see since I was like nine.

24:29.421 --> 24:30.388
Oh! And oaxaca

24:30.422 --> 24:31.689
is supposed to be incredible.

24:31.723 --> 24:34.392
Oh, all those amazing
fruit markets, right?

24:34.426 --> 24:35.493
And chocolate mole sauce.

24:35.527 --> 24:37.461
Ah, yeah.
Dude, we will see it all

24:37.496 --> 24:39.463
- and do it all!
- Guacamole with every meal.

24:39.498 --> 24:41.399
No! Margaritas with every meal!

24:41.433 --> 24:44.168
- Whoo!
- Woo-hoo!

24:44.202 --> 24:46.203
So how long do you think
we're gonna be there?

24:46.238 --> 24:47.605
I'm not sure.

24:47.639 --> 24:50.207
Some of his installations can take weeks.

24:50.242 --> 24:52.482
And rumor has it, he's got a
trip to Cuba in the works.

24:52.516 --> 24:55.396
Dude, I've been dying to see Cuba
before it's all covered in mini malls

24:55.397 --> 24:57.248
and tour buses, you know?

24:57.282 --> 24:59.083
Yeah.

25:05.123 --> 25:06.123
Where is she now?

25:08.994 --> 25:10.294
San Antonio?! That's like...

25:10.328 --> 25:12.029
that's like three hours from the border.

25:16.768 --> 25:17.868
"We're gonna find her."

25:17.903 --> 25:19.870
Have you met this Zarra person?

25:21.907 --> 25:23.787
I thought the army kid
was gonna be a problem.

25:23.822 --> 25:25.262
You, I wasn't so much worried about.

25:25.263 --> 25:26.677
Maybe I should have been.

25:27.979 --> 25:30.614
I have no idea what's going on anymore.

25:30.649 --> 25:32.209
Kathryn wanted
the hands-off approach,

25:32.210 --> 25:34.485
I wanted rules and consequences.

25:34.519 --> 25:35.820
But, guess what?

25:35.854 --> 25:37.488
Nothing worked.

25:43.528 --> 25:45.563
I know you...

25:45.597 --> 25:47.631
you had a bad time last year.

25:47.666 --> 25:50.267
So...

25:50.302 --> 25:51.602
What do I do?

25:51.636 --> 25:53.571
How do I help Bay?

25:59.544 --> 26:00.478
Okay.

26:05.250 --> 26:06.350
What's wrong?

26:06.384 --> 26:09.220
I don't know. I...
I guess I wasn't, uh,

26:09.254 --> 26:12.123
anticipating being gone for so long.

26:12.157 --> 26:15.126
Then again, I really
don't know what I thought.

26:15.160 --> 26:18.062
Oh, we don't have to join
his world tour. I mean...

26:18.096 --> 26:20.264
Oh, no no! That sounds
totally awesome.

26:20.298 --> 26:23.200
It's just, uh...

26:23.235 --> 26:25.903
I didn't say good-bye
to Daphne.

26:25.937 --> 26:28.139
Uh, I feel kinda bad just ditching her.

26:29.875 --> 26:31.555
Well, you know, when we get to Mexico city

26:31.556 --> 26:35.045
just send her a postcard or send her
an e-mail or Skype or whatever.

26:35.080 --> 26:36.747
Yeah.

26:36.781 --> 26:38.015
Yeah, it'll be fine.

26:49.728 --> 26:51.462
"Last year...

26:52.664 --> 26:53.764
Parents

26:54.799 --> 26:56.567
were in their own world."

26:59.471 --> 27:01.438
You were smashing things.

27:03.575 --> 27:05.109
So they would listen to you.

27:07.312 --> 27:09.213
So they would ask you

27:15.187 --> 27:17.121
'cause you couldn't say it.

27:25.764 --> 27:26.864
We should get goin'.

27:33.805 --> 27:36.340
Honestly, the pork rinds
from the vending machine

27:36.374 --> 27:38.409
at the last truck stop
would have been better.

27:40.378 --> 27:41.412
Aw, no!

27:41.446 --> 27:42.379
Crap!

27:47.519 --> 27:49.220
They got the rest of the money.

27:50.589 --> 27:53.357
Wait, you... you left the
money in the sleeping bag?

27:53.391 --> 27:55.092
In the car?

27:55.126 --> 27:56.393
I'm sorry, okay?

27:59.030 --> 28:00.190
Well, how much Doe have left?

28:03.401 --> 28:05.436
53. You?

28:05.470 --> 28:07.104
( Sighing ) Uh.

28:08.940 --> 28:10.107
Like 80.

28:10.141 --> 28:12.109
How much further is your dad's place?

28:12.143 --> 28:13.844
Uh, I'm not sure.

28:15.180 --> 28:17.147
Uh, maybe you should call him.

28:17.182 --> 28:19.324
Well, he called me from a pay phone

28:19.325 --> 28:21.085
and I e-mailed him
and told him was coming,

28:21.119 --> 28:23.120
but I haven't heard back, okay?

28:23.154 --> 28:25.022
So

28:25.056 --> 28:26.824
you have no idea where he is

28:26.858 --> 28:28.092
or even where we're going?

28:29.628 --> 28:30.894
No, I... I do. Basically.

28:30.929 --> 28:32.703
Well. ( Scoffs )

28:32.704 --> 28:33.864
Does he have a place to stay?

28:33.898 --> 28:34.978
Do we have a place to stay?

28:34.979 --> 28:36.700
Look! Whatever.
I will find him.

28:36.735 --> 28:38.769
It's fine.
We'll just sleep in the car,

28:38.803 --> 28:41.639
we'll save money for gas
and we'll keep heading South.

28:42.941 --> 28:44.708
Zarra, they stole my passport.

28:44.743 --> 28:46.623
You can't cross the border
without a passport!

28:46.624 --> 28:47.878
We will figure it out!

28:49.881 --> 28:52.001
What, you're not gonna
melt down on me now, are you?

28:52.002 --> 28:54.285
- No.
- Okay? 'Cause we can just go back.

28:54.319 --> 28:56.320
No.

28:56.354 --> 28:57.688
Okay then.

28:59.424 --> 29:01.325
At least they didn't take the car.

29:12.270 --> 29:14.071
Why the hell would you quit?

29:14.105 --> 29:17.207
- But everything's okay now.
- I didn't ask you to quit.

29:17.242 --> 29:19.043
I know. I just wanted to...

29:19.077 --> 29:20.811
you know how this looks?

29:20.845 --> 29:22.845
It looks like we're guilty.
Like... like we lied.

29:22.846 --> 29:23.747
But it doesn't matter

29:23.782 --> 29:25.783
because if I don't work for you anymore...

29:25.817 --> 29:27.885
if you don't work for me anymore, what?

29:30.755 --> 29:32.923
Then we can be together.

29:36.461 --> 29:37.561
Oh, honey.

29:40.432 --> 29:42.266
Oh.

29:42.300 --> 29:44.060
Oh, I'm the most
selfish man on the planet.

29:44.061 --> 29:45.369
I don't even care about the job.

29:45.403 --> 29:46.403
I'll get another job.

29:48.173 --> 29:49.406
I just wanna be with you.

29:49.441 --> 29:51.342
Daphne...

29:55.080 --> 29:56.280
Oh, no.

29:57.282 --> 30:01.085
I... I care about you.... a lot.

30:01.119 --> 30:02.886
But...

30:02.921 --> 30:04.822
I'm in love with you.

30:08.693 --> 30:10.761
You're gonna find someone

30:10.795 --> 30:12.696
so much better for you than me.

30:12.731 --> 30:15.566
Much much better.

30:18.503 --> 30:20.183
( Voice breaking ) I know what that means.

30:22.607 --> 30:25.542
That means "I don't
love you back."

30:28.213 --> 30:30.280
You were...

30:30.315 --> 30:34.952
This gift that I didn't...

30:36.254 --> 30:38.155
Expect.

30:42.794 --> 30:45.929
If I close my eyes

30:45.964 --> 30:49.600
I can't see what you're saying so
I can imagine anything I want.

30:56.541 --> 31:00.244
I'm gonna open my eyes now and...

31:00.278 --> 31:01.478
and I'm gonna go.

31:12.857 --> 31:15.159
<i>( Door opens )</i>

31:15.193 --> 31:17.094
<i>( Door closes )</i>

31:18.830 --> 31:19.863
I'm sorry.

31:28.428 --> 31:30.396
( Whispers ) Zarra. Zarra.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.098
What?

31:33.500 --> 31:34.500
Hey hey, get out of here!

31:34.501 --> 31:37.069
I've got a knife!

31:37.104 --> 31:39.338
God, I hope that's not true.

31:39.373 --> 31:41.140
Dad?

31:41.174 --> 31:42.975
Yes.

31:43.010 --> 31:44.043
Emmett?

31:44.077 --> 31:45.111
You all right?

31:45.145 --> 31:46.979
What the...?

31:47.014 --> 31:49.982
I'm fine.
What are you doing here?

31:50.017 --> 31:51.083
How did you find me?

31:53.086 --> 31:54.053
You tracked us?

31:54.087 --> 31:55.788
That would be correct.

31:57.024 --> 32:00.493
Bay, may I speak to you
for a minute please?

32:00.527 --> 32:02.461
You stay here?

32:17.611 --> 32:19.545
Emmett?

32:19.579 --> 32:22.348
Yeah. He's the one that
figured out you'd left.

32:24.484 --> 32:26.352
Bay, what are you doing?

32:28.922 --> 32:30.923
I'm going to Mexico

32:30.957 --> 32:32.158
to paint with Zarra's dad.

32:32.192 --> 32:34.860
Mexico.

32:34.895 --> 32:36.762
And possibly Cuba.

32:40.867 --> 32:41.934
Ambitious.

32:43.837 --> 32:45.571
It's probably not my best plan.

32:47.007 --> 32:48.708
And why is that?

32:50.844 --> 32:52.778
No money, no passport.

32:54.648 --> 32:55.748
That could be a problem.

32:57.651 --> 33:00.486
I'm not gonna stop doing street art.

33:01.722 --> 33:04.523
I can't stop. It's who I am.

33:04.558 --> 33:09.095
It's what I love. It's
part of what makes me...

33:10.330 --> 33:11.330
Me.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.480
And if I couldn't do it anymore,

33:14.481 --> 33:16.268
I...

33:16.303 --> 33:18.871
I would just fall apart.

33:21.808 --> 33:23.075
That is exactly

33:23.110 --> 33:26.612
how I would feel...

33:27.814 --> 33:29.482
Without you.

33:31.818 --> 33:33.886
And what are we gonna do?

33:33.920 --> 33:35.821
I don't know.

33:35.856 --> 33:39.492
But I don't think we're gonna
figure it out in this parking lot.

33:53.140 --> 33:55.007
Your mom

33:55.041 --> 33:55.975
is beside herself.

33:57.244 --> 33:59.245
Both of your moms.

34:02.983 --> 34:05.151
You cannot blame yourself.

34:05.185 --> 34:07.853
Maybe I should be trying to
be more of a parent to Bay.

34:07.888 --> 34:10.088
Maybe if I had taken her side,
she wouldn't have left.

34:10.089 --> 34:12.690
Look, she's gonna be okay.
They're gonna find her.

34:12.726 --> 34:13.826
And as an added bonus,

34:13.860 --> 34:15.628
I managed to say

34:15.661 --> 34:17.062
all the wrong things to Daphne too.

34:17.097 --> 34:18.764
About Bay?

34:18.799 --> 34:21.567
No. About the guy
Daphne's been dating.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.768
What's wrong with the guy
that Daphne's been dating?

34:25.505 --> 34:26.639
He's her boss.

34:28.341 --> 34:30.275
What do you mean he's her boss?

34:32.212 --> 34:33.545
You know what? Never mind.

34:33.580 --> 34:35.214
No no no no no!

34:35.248 --> 34:37.081
How old is he?

34:37.117 --> 34:39.485
Uh...

34:39.518 --> 34:41.353
27, 28.

34:41.388 --> 34:44.290
28? What kind of grown man
dates a 16-year-old?

34:45.958 --> 34:47.293
Where is she now? <i>I don't know.</i>

34:47.327 --> 34:48.928
She's not answering my texts.

34:49.963 --> 34:51.897
Angelo.

34:51.931 --> 34:53.165
Angelo! Where are you going?

34:53.199 --> 34:55.159
I'm gonna talk to this man
that thinks it's okay

34:55.161 --> 34:56.768
to date a high school girl.

34:56.803 --> 34:57.736
Angelo!

35:03.944 --> 35:05.978
Regina?

35:06.012 --> 35:08.514
They found Bay. She's fine.

35:08.548 --> 35:10.388
- They're bringing her home.
- Oh, thank God.

35:10.389 --> 35:12.451
I need to borrow you car.
Angelo took mine.

35:12.486 --> 35:14.487
Okay. Why?

35:15.822 --> 35:17.590
Daphne's dating her boss.

35:17.624 --> 35:19.658
- Chef Jeff?!
- Uh-huh.

35:19.693 --> 35:22.361
- What is happening with our children?
- I don't know.

35:22.395 --> 35:24.115
Yell about it in the car.
Angelo knows too

35:24.116 --> 35:26.516
and he's on his way over to
maize to talk to him right now.

35:26.517 --> 35:27.437
- Oh, no...
- Exactly.

35:27.438 --> 35:28.200
Oh.

35:28.235 --> 35:29.268
Hurry. Come on, come on.

40:53.783 --> 40:56.585
( Exhales ) I don't know.

you found out about all this?

41:01.557 --> 41:03.492
I mean, like the day before?

41:10.366 --> 41:12.501

41:12.535 --> 41:14.536

41:14.570 --> 41:16.371

41:16.405 --> 41:17.405
Sal's.

41:30.620 --> 41:33.121
So did we.

41:33.155 --> 41:35.490
Do you think we were
ever there at the same time?

41:37.193 --> 41:38.493
We must have been.

41:40.496 --> 41:42.531
What if we, like, sat next to each other

41:42.565 --> 41:44.232
or saw each other?

41:44.267 --> 41:48.503
And we had no idea.

41:48.538 --> 41:50.438
How could we not have
