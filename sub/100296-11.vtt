Oh, you have gotten so big!

00:05.700 --> 00:08.043
It's been too long
since I've seen these two.

00:08.870 --> 00:11.009
Grandma said we're gonna
see her all the time now.

00:11.050 --> 00:12.301
Is that okay?

00:12.360 --> 00:14.487
I_ wondered_ how
a national security analyst

00:14.530 --> 00:17.055
might end up driving
the sheriff of LA County,

00:17.100 --> 00:18.874
so I called your supervisor.

00:18.930 --> 00:20.227
I know what went down.

00:20.280 --> 00:21.929
DAVID: Sorry, doc.

00:21.970 --> 00:23.699
We had to take matters
into our own hands.

If anything goes wrong,

00:29.070 --> 00:30.719

BILL:
District Attorney Riley,

00:32.980 --> 00:35.323
I've handed you the guaranteed
conviction of a corrupt cop.

00:35.380 --> 00:37.029
How are you not
running with this?

00:37.080 --> 00:39.765
Today I announce
my candidacy

00:39.820 --> 00:41.947
for sheriff

Looks like things have been

01:48.020 --> 01:49.089
going well
with the children.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.833
Roberto's grades are up.

01:50.890 --> 01:52.107
That's excellent.

01:52.150 --> 01:53.321
Yeah, we've made
a lot of progress

01:53.370 --> 01:54.667
the last few months.

01:54.720 --> 01:56.415
-Feels like...
-Feels like a family.

01:56.460 --> 01:57.449
Straight up.

01:58.550 --> 02:00.586
I am obligated to inform you

02:00.640 --> 02:03.803
that Roberto and Camilla's
maternal grandmother

02:03.860 --> 02:06.374
has filed for custody
of the grandchildren.

Oh, my God.

02:09.860 --> 02:10.849
I knew it.

02:10.910 --> 02:11.865
She called in this past--

02:11.910 --> 02:13.161

We've been

our own for months.

02:19.310 --> 02:20.652
They are our own.

02:21.610 --> 02:23.612
This is why we go over
concurrent planning.

02:23.660 --> 02:25.651
Something like this
is always a possibility.

02:25.710 --> 02:28.178
That woman didn't even
go to their father's funeral,

02:28.670 --> 02:30.968
Okay? She's just gonna swoop in
and take them from us?

02:31.020 --> 02:32.442
What's the angle here?

02:32.500 --> 02:34.013
She doin' it for the money?

02:34.710 --> 02:37.099
Carmen is doing
all the required work.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.623
She's making the efforts.

02:39.680 --> 02:41.022
Effort?

02:41.550 --> 02:43.154
Did you even do
a background check?

02:44.030 --> 02:46.191
'Cause if she's hanging outwith the same scumbags he was...

02:46.250 --> 02:47.854
Okay, listen, obviously,
you can recognize

02:47.900 --> 02:49.458
that our-our main concern

02:49.510 --> 02:51.205
is for the well-being
of Camilla and Roberto.

02:51.560 --> 02:54.905
We've provided a safe,

I'm not gonna.

Nothing has been decided yet.

03:03.050 --> 03:04.870
But biological relatives
are preferred.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.046
You told us that.

03:06.490 --> 03:08.879
All I can say
is trust the process.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.262
Oh, I know the process.

03:11.230 --> 03:12.185
I have my own.

03:22.810 --> 03:24.368
Present the best case you can.

03:40.560 --> 03:41.606
What's that?

Stop thinking so hard.

03:43.740 --> 03:44.820
It doesn't suit you.

I appreciate it.

what the hell is that?

03:54.750 --> 03:56.741
At least I eat.
What's your excuse?

03:59.150 --> 04:00.230
I'm not hungry.

04:01.850 --> 04:03.659
If you ask me,
it's your conscience.

Maybe.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.813
She probably wants to
sue our own people.

And there you are,
not eatin'.

Say it.

I want the job, all right?

I want it.

could get hurt if I--

Let me tell you something, son.

04:40.670 --> 04:42.968
You're gonna piss folks offno matter what.

04:43.710 --> 04:44.790
That's just life.

04:46.060 --> 04:48.062
Might as well be for somethin'
worth a damn.

-I didn't go.

Then what...

Let me guess.
Carter and coalition.

They get a bad wrap
but they're good dudes.

Trust me,
Carter and his boys

05:27.020 --> 05:28.669
are not the crew
you wanna roll wrth.

Can't believe you faked
on your boys like that.

that bag in the back seat.

Why?

I thought it would be safer.

what this election is about?

I've got a strong suspicion
that you'd like to tell me.

It's about space.

And time.

They deserve one.

off this guy.

-MINNICK: Sir.
-Hey.

11:37.260 --> 11:38.818
JOSEPH:
You down here
for a case?

11:38.870 --> 11:40.258
Yeah.

11:40.740 --> 11:41.729
Uh...

11:42.570 --> 11:44.083
Man, I missed it down here.

11:44.130 --> 11:47.600
Bad coffee.
1950's office furniture.

11:47.660 --> 11:49.560
-[Minnick chuckles]
-And real paperwork.

11:50.790 --> 11:52.041
You okay, sir?

11:52.660 --> 11:53.706
Not really.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.609
-You got a sec?
-Yeah.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.229
They're gonna give
Johnson a deal.

12:05.280 --> 12:06.542
What?

12:06.590 --> 12:07.670
Why?

12:08.900 --> 12:10.765
Short answer, it's political.

12:10.810 --> 12:12.766
We can fight it, Bill.
We have to.

12:13.770 --> 12:15.203
Fight's comin' to us.

12:15.250 --> 12:16.899
DA flipped the table.

12:16.950 --> 12:19.680
She's investigating
how we intervened in the case.

12:20.130 --> 12:22.030
Me and you in particular.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.638
She's got a court order
behind her.

12:23.690 --> 12:25.772
Good.
She can bring it.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.736
Well, you're gonna
have to sit with her.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.473
We can get you a union rep,
department lavwer.

12:30.530 --> 12:32.088
-Whatever you want.
-I don't want anyone.

12:32.140 --> 12:33.619
I know my truth.

12:33.660 --> 12:35.048
All right.

12:35.100 --> 12:36.749
Well, just remember
it's not personal.

12:36.790 --> 12:37.791
I know it feels like that.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.535
But emotion's
your enemy here.

12:40.450 --> 12:41.667
Gives her leverage.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.629
It's just about power,
nothing else.

12:46.630 --> 12:47.665
Yeah, I'm ready.

12:48.240 --> 12:49.320
Don't be too ready.

12:49.370 --> 12:50.803
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

12:50.850 --> 12:52.841
[officers clamoring]

12:54.160 --> 12:56.412
-What's up?
-MINNICK: Multiple 2455.

12:56.470 --> 12:57.767
Sounds like drive-bys.

13:00.300 --> 13:02.245
DISPATCHER:
David-5-5-7 responding.

13:02.300 --> 13:04.256
-How many shootings?
-Three, so far.

13:04.300 --> 13:06.427
-Minnick, you rollin' out?
-Yes, sir.

13:06.480 --> 13:07.424
JOSEPH: What about me?

13:07.480 --> 13:08.697
Handle that paperwork, boot.

13:10.310 --> 13:11.914
You heard her.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.655
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

13:17.660 --> 13:18.786
Deputy Bishop.

13:19.660 --> 13:21.002
Please have a seat.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.142
It's nice to meet you, too.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.366
[beeps]

13:27.930 --> 13:31.627
Detective Bishop,
I understand
that you, personally,

13:31.680 --> 13:34.103
voiced concern
about Sheriff Hollister

13:34.160 --> 13:37.118
getting himself involved
in the LAPD murder case

13:37.160 --> 13:38.673
led by Detective Johnson.

13:39.730 --> 13:41.152
Should I have
an attorney present?

13:41.210 --> 13:42.814
Or my union rep maybe?

13:42.860 --> 13:45.465
Well, I mean, you are here
out of your own recognizance,

13:45.520 --> 13:46.851
as I see it.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.730
I mean, if you want
an attorney present,

13:48.780 --> 13:49.997
that's your prerogative.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.689
Although I have a feeling

13:51.740 --> 13:54.049
that you can
handle yourself just fine.

13:56.700 --> 13:57.917
Did you voice concern?

13:59.360 --> 14:00.520
It's been so busy.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.654
I moved to Majors.I broke up with my girlfriend.

14:03.710 --> 14:04.699
Ijust...

14:06.320 --> 14:07.833
I just don't remember anything
like what you're describing.

14:09.410 --> 14:10.445
RILEY: Hmm.

14:12.890 --> 14:13.879
You know what?

14:14.590 --> 14:17.320
You and I,
we should clear the air.

14:17.370 --> 14:19.065
I don't_want there to be
any misunderstandings

14:19.110 --> 14:20.247
straight out of the gate.

14:21.420 --> 14:22.671
This deposition order,

14:22.730 --> 14:25.244
it has nothing
to do with you personally.

14:25.900 --> 14:26.889
Good to know.

14:27.730 --> 14:29.072
I'm an outsider here.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.860
You know it, I know it.

14:32.910 --> 14:36.732
It's, uh, why I had to do
my own research.

14:36.780 --> 14:38.384
To play catch-up.

14:40.570 --> 14:41.605
What is that?

14:42.140 --> 14:43.391
Evidence.

14:43.440 --> 14:44.691
Of what?

14:44.750 --> 14:46.650
Department violations.

14:47.450 --> 14:49.350
_ The Johnson case_
IS merely emblematic

14:49.410 --> 14:52.277
of larger,
system-wide failures.

14:52.580 --> 14:55.367
Now, okay, a lot of this
predates Sheriff Hollister,

14:55.410 --> 14:58.368
but he is not the man
to Implement reforms.

14:58.410 --> 15:02.323
The whole John Wayne routine
only goes so far.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.020
The results since
Sheriff Hollister took office

15:05.070 --> 15:07.379
-speak for themselves.
-RILEY: At what cost?

15:07.420 --> 15:10.207
The future of this department
isn't in the past.

15:10.250 --> 15:11.729
It is right now.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.680
With people like you,
not him.

15:14.820 --> 15:16.606
Look, this is not
a hard case to make.

15:16.650 --> 15:18.902
It is right here
in black and white.

15:23.660 --> 15:25.434
You know what
I haven't gotten into...

15:26.880 --> 15:28.916
are the secrets.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.830
You know, the tucked away stuff.

15:37.840 --> 15:38.886
But I will.

15:41.630 --> 15:42.938
It was nice talking to you.

15:42.980 --> 15:44.845
And I'm sorry
about your girlfriend.

16:02.390 --> 16:03.869
[horns honking]

16:03.910 --> 16:05.434
So you've been involved

16:05.480 --> 16:06.993
in how many shootings

16:07.050 --> 16:08.699
since Sheriff Hollister
took office?

16:10.010 --> 16:11.398
It's not polite to count.

16:12.010 --> 16:13.318
More than ten?

16:13.360 --> 16:15.965
-Less than 20?
-[laughs]

16:16.010 --> 16:17.966
We all go through
the same review
after a shooting.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.089
You know that, Carol.

16:19.150 --> 16:20.799
You're fishin'.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.319
Oh, come on, Cade,

16:22.370 --> 16:23.792
I'm the county's
district attorney,

16:23.850 --> 16:24.976
I don't fish.

16:26.420 --> 16:27.933
Then why haven't you asked me
about the Johnson case

16:27.980 --> 16:29.538
'cause that's what _this_ whole
song and dance IS, right?

16:29.590 --> 16:30.716
-[cell phone buzzing]
-Ohh.

16:30.770 --> 16:32.158
I gotta get this.
[clears throat]

16:32.200 --> 16:34.373
Wait, wait, wait.
You can't just walk out.

16:34.420 --> 16:36.468
CADE:
Hey, I'll tell Bill
you said hi.

16:36.510 --> 16:38.296
And I'll put together
a grand jury

16:38.340 --> 16:39.898
before you can blink!

16:40.260 --> 16:41.864
-[door closes]
-[sighs]

16:46.740 --> 16:48.298
So you don't have a real name.

16:48.350 --> 16:49.658
JOSEPH [on phone]:
Guy's using a fake.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.474
Will take a while
to get his prints back.

16:51.530 --> 16:53.134
Send me a picture of the ID.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.738
I will see ifI can
get my contacts

16:54.790 --> 16:56.132
at State to run the face.

16:56.180 --> 16:58.569
Also, there's a company name
on his car rental.

16:58.620 --> 17:01.009
Camino Verdad. I haven't
been able to find anything.

17:01.060 --> 17:02.186
Send it over, too.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.276
[beeps]

17:08.370 --> 17:10.190
-Okay.
-Are you gonna record this?

17:11.460 --> 17:12.540
Should I?

17:13.720 --> 17:15.028
It's your investigation.

17:15.070 --> 17:17.766
-Well, you started it.
-No.

17:18.340 --> 17:20.149
No, actually that would be
the LAPD officer

17:20.210 --> 17:21.723
who pointed a gun
at my head.

17:22.340 --> 17:23.728
And how did that make you feel?

17:24.730 --> 17:26.163
How would it make you feel?

17:26.210 --> 17:29.168
Whoa, let's be honest,
it would be very unlikely

17:29.220 --> 17:31.381
that I would find myself
in that situation.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.954
Oh, so you think the LAPD
has a race problem?

17:34.000 --> 17:36.389
Oh, I think that LA County
has a race problem,

17:36.440 --> 17:38.135
which is why
I'm running for sheriff.

17:40.230 --> 17:42.130
Then why did you
offer Johnson a deal?

17:43.930 --> 17:46.922
Because he offered me
something much more valuable.

17:48.020 --> 17:49.055
The white vote?

17:54.760 --> 17:56.068
Names.

17:56.110 --> 17:57.418
Links to other cases

17:57.460 --> 17:59.325
that I've had
sitting on my desk.

18:00.860 --> 18:02.896
I promise you
when this is all over,

18:02.950 --> 18:06.249
LA County will be a much
safer place for everyone.

18:07.690 --> 18:08.725
Great.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.168
So why are you telling me?

18:12.130 --> 18:14.519
Because what you did
was not wrong.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.268
Running down
Detective Johnson,

18:17.310 --> 18:20.268
that was the result
of great natural Instincts

18:20.310 --> 18:21.959
and sharp detective work.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.658
So why the court order?
Why the depositions?

18:24.710 --> 18:25.836
Why am I talking to you?

18:25.880 --> 18:28.269
Like I said,
you did nothing wrong.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.109
Your godfather,
as acting sheriff,

18:31.150 --> 18:33.050
he had no business
getting involved.

18:33.670 --> 18:36.457
He used department resourcesfor personal reasons.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.808
He's gonna pay the price.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.845
I want deputies like you

18:40.900 --> 18:42.856
to be the new face
of this department.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.288
Of my department.

18:45.900 --> 18:48.596
With all due respect, what you
see as a personal motivation

18:48.640 --> 18:51.461
was in actuality a sheriffbelieving in one of his deputies

18:51.520 --> 18:53.818
and having the courage
to fight for justice

18:53.870 --> 18:56.293
regardless of
political backlash.

18:58.090 --> 19:00.251
That is why
this is his department

19:00.310 --> 19:02.346
and it is not gonna change.

19:04.830 --> 19:08.129
Now, if you don't mind,
I've got paperwork.

19:08.580 --> 19:09.968
So do I.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.972
Just left the scene
of a drive-by near Athens.

19:23.030 --> 19:24.281
I heard about that.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.718
There was three of 'em?
All at the same time?

19:25.770 --> 19:26.805
Four, actually.

19:26.860 --> 19:28.020
But no victims.

19:28.950 --> 19:31.373
-Someone sending a message?
-Maybe.

19:31.430 --> 19:33.159
BILL: Talk to me.

19:33.210 --> 19:35.075
Deputy Harris asked me
to help identify a suspect

19:35.130 --> 19:36.461
in holding at Lennox.

19:36.520 --> 19:39.080
ID was a fake, so I asked
my contacts at State

19:39.130 --> 19:40.347
to run the face.

19:40.390 --> 19:41.823
He's Kaito Hamanaka.

19:41.870 --> 19:44.566
Japanese, dual citizen,
educated in the States.

19:45.050 --> 19:47.689
Man's got organized
crime connections
here and at home,

19:47.750 --> 19:49.308
and recently started
doing business

19:49.360 --> 19:50.702
with the cartels in Mexico.

19:51.270 --> 19:53.226
Feds think
he's consolidating power

19:53.270 --> 19:56.319
to become the cocaine supplier
for Southeast Asia.

19:56.360 --> 19:57.884
That's why he's here.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.181
Closing the deal.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.231
So he's in booking at Lennox
right now?

20:01.280 --> 20:02.451
Yes, sir.

20:03.110 --> 20:05.010
Well, he's got
some dangerous friends.

20:05.070 --> 20:06.321
And there's money on the line.

20:06.370 --> 20:07.325
CADE:
What are you thinkin'?

20:07.380 --> 20:08.893
They're not gonna let it lie.

20:10.380 --> 20:12.462
If he's still in booking
then he made his call.

20:14.900 --> 20:16.856
There's still no arrests
on those drIve-bys.

20:16.910 --> 20:19.071
No, most of Lennox
is still out on the hunt.

20:19.870 --> 20:21.735
And they happened
after booking this guy.

20:25.610 --> 20:27.862
-Get SEB down_ there now.
-On It.

20:27.920 --> 20:30.263
Make sure the Feds know
we've got this guy.

20:30.660 --> 20:31.740
Copy.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.435
Yo, Harris.

20:34.270 --> 20:35.612
Look what I found.

20:35.660 --> 20:37.218
Don't get too close though.
He's ripe.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.441
[chuckles]

20:38.490 --> 20:40.446
You really do have a way
with people, Carter.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.922
This is harassment.

20:42.630 --> 20:44.279
Man, you came up to me.

20:44.330 --> 20:45.797
Not my problem
you were in possession.

20:45.850 --> 20:46.885
MAN:
Man, that ain't mine.

20:46.940 --> 20:48.362
This guy planted that on me.

20:48.420 --> 20:49.717
Yeah?

20:49.770 --> 20:51.249
I'll call the ACLU.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.451
[gate buzzes]

20:55.290 --> 20:56.245
Stop.

21:01.430 --> 21:02.556
All yours.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.249
[handcuffs clicking]

21:14.440 --> 21:15.566
Man, I didn't do nothing!

21:15.620 --> 21:17.133
Tell it to your mother.

21:18.450 --> 21:19.963
Same way I did
last night.

21:28.980 --> 21:30.459
What took you so long?

21:32.460 --> 21:34.451
[dramatic music playing]

21:46.000 --> 21:47.388
[cell phone buzzes]

21:48.350 --> 21:49.601
Hey, Bill.

21:49.650 --> 21:51.436
Joseph, the driver
you brought in today,

21:51.480 --> 21:52.435
where is he?

21:52.480 --> 21:53.822
He's in holding.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.431
He's cartel connected,

21:55.480 --> 21:57.209
and may have some people
coming to get him.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.615
Are you sure? He was asleep
last time I checked.

21:59.660 --> 22:02.128
BILL: Quickly and quietly
move him into his own cell,

22:02.190 --> 22:04.181
post extra deputies
at the station entrance.

22:04.230 --> 22:06.357
I'm five minutes away.

22:06.410 --> 22:07.889
Cade's coming with SEB.

22:07.930 --> 22:09.010
Okay.

22:09.370 --> 22:10.621
Boot, what's happening?

22:20.200 --> 22:21.280
Shut up.

22:21.730 --> 22:22.856
I'm starving, bro.

22:23.470 --> 22:24.949
Not my problem, bro.

22:27.380 --> 22:28.335
What you say to me?

22:29.040 --> 22:30.257
Say it again, bro.

22:30.300 --> 22:31.517
I didn't hear you.

22:34.390 --> 22:35.379
I think you did.

22:38.050 --> 22:39.210
Hey! Hey!

22:41.440 --> 22:42.691
Knock it off!
Open this up.

22:46.060 --> 22:47.357

22:48.450 --> 22:49.576
You wanna get maced?

22:50.230 --> 22:51.367

24:23.020 --> 24:24.066

Let's start again.

24:37.340 --> 24:39.388
[intense music playing]

24:41.340 --> 24:42.944
They have a gun

Minnick!

24:45.090 --> 24:46.819

24:46.870 --> 24:48.690
He broke out of holding

24:49.920 --> 24:51.308
They took Carter hostage.

24:51.350 --> 24:52.692
How the hell did that happen?

24:53.230 --> 24:54.390
I don't know.
They got a gun.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.488
Okay, are they still
in the building?

24:56.530 --> 24:57.792
Yeah, I think so.

24:57.840 --> 24:59.398
MINNICK:
Listen to me and stay focused.

24:59.450 --> 25:01.315
I need you to seal
the perimeter,

25:01.360 --> 25:03.408
I'm gonna secure
the armory, you got that?

25:03.450 --> 25:04.667
Seal the perimeter.
I got it.

Hands now!

CADE; _
Not gonna say It again!
Get on the ground!

30:14.070 --> 30:15.230
Lay on your stomach.

30:23.250 --> 30:25.161
First smart thing
you did all day.

30:26.990 --> 30:28.070
Son of a bitch.

30:29.690 --> 30:30.679
Is everyone okay?

30:30.740 --> 30:31.957
BILL [on phone]:
Yeah.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.479
What about Deputy Grover?

30:33.520 --> 30:34.737
I heard he was taken
to St. Regents.

30:34.780 --> 30:36.179
Any updates?

30:36.220 --> 30:38.529
Just got out of his surgery.
He's gonna be okay.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.049
Bullet didn't rupture
any vital organs.

30:40.090 --> 30:42.229
-Thank God.
-Did you get the guy?

30:42.570 --> 30:43.912
Guys. Yeah.

30:44.530 --> 30:47.875
SEB's sweeping upthe rest of their operation now.

30:47.930 --> 30:50.319
-BILL: Long day.
-No kidding.

30:50.370 --> 30:52.622
I've had my hands full
since the second I walked in.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.066
What's wrong?

30:57.460 --> 30:58.540
I...

31:01.290 --> 31:02.370
I had a moment.

31:03.250 --> 31:04.501
BILL: What do you mean?

31:04.550 --> 31:05.596
A moment.

31:06.420 --> 31:08.376
While doing
some routine surgery.

31:09.470 --> 31:10.721
Deja vu?

31:11.260 --> 31:12.386
Yeah, exactly.

31:12.430 --> 31:14.478
Just a little PTSD,
out of nowhere.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.029
Are you okay?

31:16.090 --> 31:17.079
Yeah, I am now.

31:17.130 --> 31:18.381
But at the time...

31:19.960 --> 31:21.564
I'll be honest,
it scared me.

31:21.920 --> 31:24.047
Well, after everything
you went through,
it's natural.

31:24.310 --> 31:25.914
Yeah, I know but I'm a surgeon.

31:25.970 --> 31:27.574
I cut people open for a living.

31:28.270 --> 31:29.612
You told me _
once that In your job

31:29.670 --> 31:31.058
there's no room for distraction,

31:31.100 --> 31:32.442
it requires total focus.

31:32.970 --> 31:33.925
I remember.

31:33.970 --> 31:35.756
Well, it's the same for me.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.620
You know, an accountant
makes a mistake,

31:38.670 --> 31:40.626
they just press delete.

31:40.680 --> 31:41.897
I slip up and...

31:41.940 --> 31:43.066
But you got through it.

31:44.330 --> 31:46.241
Yeah. Like I said,
it was just a moment.

31:46.290 --> 31:47.416
BILL:
Well, there might be more.

31:47.470 --> 31:49.893
PTSD likes to circle back.

31:49.950 --> 31:51.110
I know.

31:51.770 --> 31:53.112
And I'm prepared for that.

31:54.470 --> 31:55.516
But today...

31:58.260 --> 31:59.909
today taught me
I can deal with it.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.249
I know you can.

32:02.870 --> 32:04.656
-I'm proud of you, honey.
-Thank you.

32:04.700 --> 32:06.748
WOMAN [over PA]:
Dr. Reyes, please call OR 3.

32:06.790 --> 32:08.655
Dr. Reyes, OR 3.

32:08.700 --> 32:10.395
BILL:
Sounds like you gotta go.

32:10.450 --> 32:11.781
Yeah, we'll talk tonight.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.264
I love you.

32:13.710 --> 32:14.790
I love you, too.

32:30.730 --> 32:32.413
I don't normally
say things like this.

32:32.470 --> 32:34.893
I'm not trying to get all up
in my feelings with you, but...

32:36.210 --> 32:37.290
I'm proud of you, boot.

32:38.820 --> 32:39.866
You did good today.

32:41.040 --> 32:42.644
You're making a lot of progress.

32:42.690 --> 32:44.248
You sure you're not
just saying that

32:44.310 --> 32:45.698
so you can push me
through my training,

32:46.440 --> 32:47.737
get that promotion of yours?

32:49.270 --> 32:50.521
See, that's exactly why
I don't give you compliments,

32:50.570 --> 32:52.481
'cause you'd be
feeling yourself too much.

32:52.530 --> 32:54.657
-Oh, is that what I'm doing?
-Yeah, that's exactly
what you're doing.

32:55.400 --> 32:56.480
But it's all right.

32:56.530 --> 32:57.440
Imma let you slide
'cause you got

32:57.490 --> 32:58.707
a lot of paperwork to do

32:58.750 --> 33:00.149
and I don't want you
gettin' distracted.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.009
You tried it.
I think what you meant to say

33:03.060 --> 33:04.709
is that wehave a lot
of papenNork to do.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.273
Nah, with evals coming up,

33:06.330 --> 33:07.888
I think I'm gonna
take a step back,

33:07.940 --> 33:10.329
you know, take more
of a supervisory role.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.506
Do you know how much
paperwork is in there?

33:14.680 --> 33:16.329
I'll review your work
in the morning.

33:16.600 --> 33:18.113
She is not joking.

33:18.170 --> 33:19.979
If you need me,
you know where to find me.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.029
Deputy Minnick.

33:24.870 --> 33:25.905
Thank you.

33:33.530 --> 33:35.566
Well, turns out that
Hamanaka was on his way

33:35.620 --> 33:37.520
to seal the deal
with the cartel brass

33:37.580 --> 33:38.649
when he got pulled over.

33:38.710 --> 33:40.530
I mean, like,
five minutes away.

33:41.060 --> 33:42.834
It's his own damn fault.

33:42.890 --> 33:45.927
The DMV handbook says to
always use your turn signal.

33:45.980 --> 33:47.311
[laughs] Page one.

33:47.370 --> 33:49.588
Hey, any update
on Camilla and Roberto?

33:49.630 --> 33:51.848
Uh, Teresa left a message.

33:51.890 --> 33:53.152
And?

33:53.200 --> 33:54.371
Haven't listened to it yet.

33:54.420 --> 33:55.717
Why not?

33:55.770 --> 33:57.544
Well, I got this rule
I like to stick to.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.158
One catastrophe at a time.

33:59.210 --> 34:01.292
You're in
the wrong busrness, brother.

34:01.900 --> 34:03.071
Well, think positive.

34:03.120 --> 34:05.031
You and Teresa
have a strong case.

34:05.080 --> 34:06.251
You're great parents,

34:06.300 --> 34:07.426
and those kids
are In your corner.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.209
Yeah, well,
tell that to the judge.

34:10.130 --> 34:11.119
What's up, Bishop?

34:11.910 --> 34:13.434
Just got word from SEB.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.528
They intercepted
a drug shipment
out of Long Beach.

34:15.570 --> 34:17.561
Hamanaka's contacts
are In custody.

34:18.090 --> 34:19.569
Not bad for a day's work.

34:19.920 --> 34:21.785
Most sheriffs hope
for one of these victories

34:21.840 --> 34:23.398
in an entire term.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.276
I'll type up the report.

34:34.240 --> 34:35.753
Some office you got here.

34:37.240 --> 34:38.286
Dad?

34:38.640 --> 34:39.766
Not bad, kid.

34:40.550 --> 34:42.415
Feel like I'm in
the President's office.

34:43.420 --> 34:45.069
You okay?
What are you doing here?

34:45.860 --> 34:48.590
I thought I'd come downand say hi to some of the guys.

34:50.300 --> 34:51.289
That's great.

34:51.350 --> 34:52.681
Hey, I got donuts.

34:58.530 --> 34:59.952
Don't worry,

35:00.480 --> 35:01.822
your mother knows I'm here.

35:06.190 --> 35:08.442
Mom's been gone
for over three years now.

35:09.710 --> 35:11.018
You remember that, right?

35:15.020 --> 35:16.066
Yeah.

35:18.980 --> 35:20.368
Are you still
running for sheriff?

35:23.200 --> 35:24.189
Yeah.

35:24.990 --> 35:25.979
That's good.

35:26.950 --> 35:29.339
One thing a man
doesn't need is regrets.

35:29.730 --> 35:32.426
Says the one person
I've never heard regret a thing

35:32.470 --> 35:33.812
his whole damn life.

35:34.340 --> 35:36.296
Dropped out of
rodeo clown school.

35:37.170 --> 35:38.432
I regretted that.

35:38.480 --> 35:39.697
What?

35:40.000 --> 35:41.251
Summer after high school,

35:41.310 --> 35:42.959
I wanted to be
a rodeo clown.

35:43.010 --> 35:44.955
[both laugh]

35:45.010 --> 35:46.170
You didn't know that, did you?

35:46.230 --> 35:47.299
BILL: NO.

35:49.100 --> 35:51.534
I guess it would've been like
what you ended up doing anyway.

35:52.710 --> 35:55.702
A rodeo clown's job
is to jump in the ring

35:55.760 --> 35:57.102
when things go wrong.

35:57.720 --> 36:00.496
Make themselves
the target to save others.

36:02.680 --> 36:04.898
How's that any different
from what we do around here?

36:11.510 --> 36:12.943
Let me fix you here.

36:13.510 --> 36:14.556
Oh.

36:16.040 --> 36:17.075
Thank you.

36:18.950 --> 36:20.429
[cell phone buzzing]

36:22.040 --> 36:23.735
-That's Maggie.
-Hey.

36:24.260 --> 36:26.478
Hey, Mags, I'm sittin'
with your grandad.

36:26.530 --> 36:27.747
We're just ta--

36:29.700 --> 36:30.871
What's the matter, honey?

36:33.710 --> 36:35.007
Maggie.

36:35.060 --> 36:36.402
Calm down, okay?

36:36.450 --> 36:38.759
Take a deep breath.
I'll call you right back.

36:39.710 --> 36:42.019
-What's wrong?
-I don't know.

36:42.060 --> 36:44.324
REPORTER [on TV]:
...saying that
the potential misconduct

36:44.370 --> 36:47.191
does involve the misuse
of department resources.

36:47.240 --> 36:49.765
RILEY [on TV]:
The Sheriff appears
to have been compromised

36:49.810 --> 36:51.596
in his official
decision-making

36:51.640 --> 36:53.892
by personal relationships
and favors.

36:53.950 --> 36:55.941
Turn the damn thing off, son.

36:55.990 --> 36:57.161
Not a chance.

36:58.820 --> 36:59.855
Is this something you think
the sheriff should resign over?

36:59.910 --> 37:01.730
Oh, I-I'm not here
to wag my finger

37:01.780 --> 37:03.213
or pass moral judgment.

37:03.430 --> 37:07.514
It is my job, however,
to look into any behavior

37:07.570 --> 37:09.344
public or private,

37:09.400 --> 37:12.267
of an elected official
to faithfully carry out

37:12.310 --> 37:13.789
civic obligations.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.319
-[turns off TV]
-It's all crap.

37:16.580 --> 37:17.797
You're in the game now.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.959
Don't take this stuff personal.It's not personal.

37:21.020 --> 37:22.578
It's only about power.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.280
You still here, huh?

37:35.290 --> 37:36.461
Yeah, I got homework, man.

37:36.510 --> 37:37.590
All right.

37:38.690 --> 37:39.759
Well...

37:40.950 --> 37:42.645
homework's for school kids.

37:44.950 --> 37:46.599
Give Adams something to do
in the morning.

37:48.170 --> 37:50.252
You keep thinking like a newbie,you're gonna stay a newbie.

37:50.310 --> 37:52.824
-Man, Minnick is gonna--
-Minnick's not your mommy.

38:00.010 --> 38:02.478
Thanks... for today.

38:05.670 --> 38:07.570
It's my own damn fault,
I shouldn't have gone in there

38:07.630 --> 38:09.018
and tried to break things up.

38:09.060 --> 38:11.016
Guys are never gonna
let me live this one down.

38:11.370 --> 38:13.019
You were just
doing your job, man.

38:13.070 --> 38:15.106
Nah, man, I should've
just tased both of them

38:15.160 --> 38:16.718
and then
kept drinking my coffee.

38:23.640 --> 38:26.165
Two guys died
and Hamanaka's
g0Ing to supermax

38:26.210 --> 38:27.336
for the rest of his life.

38:27.390 --> 38:29.290
It feels like
plenty of payback to me.

38:29.350 --> 38:30.647
Yeah, not them.

38:32.130 --> 38:34.257
Talking about the next piece
of trash we bring in here.

38:34.610 --> 38:35.998
You get rid of one

38:36.050 --> 38:38.439
and another one just
crawls out from under a rock

38:38.490 --> 38:39.696
takes his place.

38:40.790 --> 38:42.781
They're cockroaches, man.
They're cockroaches.

38:42.840 --> 38:44.182
And we bring 'em in here
and we feed 'em

38:44.230 --> 38:47.313
three square meals a day
on the taxpayer's dime.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.315
So...

38:51.020 --> 38:52.055
who's the chump?

38:54.410 --> 38:56.549
Anyhow, today...

38:58.030 --> 39:00.066
you showed me that
you're the real deal.

39:01.420 --> 39:03.854
-Thanks. Man, I--
-I mean it.

39:04.900 --> 39:07.505
It's one thing to tag along,
get a few beers, but...

39:08.860 --> 39:10.384
today you became one of us.

39:13.610 --> 39:16.340
There are people out there
who get how the world works,

39:16.390 --> 39:17.698
and there are people who don't.

39:19.130 --> 39:20.210
You get it.

39:24.710 --> 39:26.746
Not sure exactly what I get.

39:28.060 --> 39:29.049
You will.

39:31.710 --> 39:34.406
All right, man, come on,
get your ass outta that chair.

39:34.450 --> 39:36.099
Let me buy you a drink.

39:41.420 --> 39:42.899
Come on.

39:46.940 --> 39:48.339
There you go.

39:51.430 --> 39:52.772
JOSEPH:
She's gonna kill me.

39:52.820 --> 39:53.900
[Carter chuckles]

40:03.270 --> 40:04.396
Is Maggie okay?

40:04.440 --> 40:05.782
She says she is.

40:07.620 --> 40:08.746
You don't believe her.

40:10.270 --> 40:11.521
I told her not to worry.

40:11.580 --> 40:13.138
It'll all be over soon.

40:14.450 --> 40:15.621
Riley got what she wanted.

40:17.930 --> 40:19.272
What does that mean?

40:20.280 --> 40:21.451
Well, maybe you saw it coming,

40:21.980 --> 40:23.140
I was gonna tell you tonight

40:23.200 --> 40:24.974
that I decided
to run for sheriff.

40:27.860 --> 40:28.929
But not anymore.

40:29.510 --> 40:30.590
I'm done.

40:31.600 --> 40:32.635
You're what?

40:33.470 --> 40:34.630
I'm not running, honey.

40:37.170 --> 40:37.989
Bill.

40:38.040 --> 40:39.473
Riley's out for blood.

40:40.220 --> 40:41.733
She'll dig through
all my old cases.

40:41.780 --> 40:42.951
Every complaint.

40:44.350 --> 40:45.476
And if that doesn't work,
she'll come after you.

40:46.130 --> 40:47.438
I can't let that happen.

40:48.310 --> 40:49.345
I won't.

40:50.490 --> 40:51.434
So that's it.

41:09.850 --> 41:11.454
Do you remember
our second date?

41:14.550 --> 41:16.154
Not bottles night.
Olvera Street?

41:16.210 --> 41:17.723
Dancing in the plaza.

41:18.600 --> 41:20.648
'Course I remember.
What does that ha--

41:20.690 --> 41:22.294
Walking back to the car
that night,

41:22.340 --> 41:24.342
that guy tried to grab my ass.

41:27.740 --> 41:29.048
You broke his nose.

41:30.350 --> 41:31.692
I can handle myself.

41:32.660 --> 41:33.695
BILL: Oh, I know.

41:34.400 --> 41:35.651
You're a fighter.

41:36.180 --> 41:37.488
It's what I love about you.

41:38.580 --> 41:39.706
I still am.

41:41.540 --> 41:43.360
You say that now,
but Maggie--

41:43.410 --> 41:45.492
She said she's okay
because she is.

41:47.720 --> 41:49.494
So unless you're afraid...

41:53.680 --> 41:54.715
Yeah.

41:55.600 --> 41:56.669
That's it.

41:58.860 --> 42:01.420
That's the look
I wanna see when
someone's comIng after you.

42:02.910 --> 42:04.559
Bill Hollister,
you're running for sheriff

42:04.600 --> 42:07.216
because you are
the best man for the job.

42:07.910 --> 42:10.253
Since you've taken over,
this city is safer,

42:10.310 --> 42:12.039
morale is higher.

42:12.660 --> 42:15.345
You're gonna run
and you're gonna win.

42:15.400 --> 42:18.039
And your family's gonna be
right beside you.

42:19.880 --> 42:21.529
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

42:23.580 --> 42:24.615
Let's do this.

42:36.900 --> 42:37.935
I love you.
