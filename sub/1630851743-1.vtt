02:03.125 --> 02:05.292
-Who was that?
-Andrea.

02:11.625 --> 02:12.667
You okay?

02:15.208 --> 02:17.083
Did you leave the sliding door open?

02:18.917 --> 02:19.917
No.

02:21.667 --> 02:24.250
It's a bad habit leaving doors open.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.792
Once the termites get in,
you can never get rid of them.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.208
-Okay?
-Okay.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.833
Everybody just wants to be famous.

02:40.542 --> 02:42.750
And for what?

02:43.542 --> 02:47.667
So we can pretend we're famous too...

02:48.125 --> 02:50.583
but it's fucking fake, the whole thing.

02:51.125 --> 02:52.667
Photoshop.

02:55.958 --> 02:57.792
Hell, I could be famous

02:58.750 --> 03:00.542
with these window-shoppers.

03:02.875 --> 03:04.958
Be happy with what you've got.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.083
You too, so easily manipulated.

03:09.833 --> 03:11.458
I'll never understand it.

03:23.208 --> 03:25.208
So I have to talk to you about something.

03:31.417 --> 03:34.333
About a month ago, I got a purple letter,

03:34.417 --> 03:36.708
an anonymous letter

03:37.292 --> 03:42.708
inviting me to meet
an admirer in a hotel room.

03:45.625 --> 03:48.042
I thought it was stupid.

03:48.583 --> 03:50.167
I thought it might have been...

03:51.250 --> 03:53.917
I don't know what I thought.

03:55.875 --> 03:58.833
But I went, and it was once.

03:59.708 --> 04:04.417
And I realized that I've been unhappy.

04:06.708 --> 04:08.417
I am unhappy.

04:10.292 --> 04:14.542
I've given you ten fantastic years,

04:14.625 --> 04:18.916
years that I'll never regret.

04:19.666 --> 04:21.708
But I'm asking you now to let me leave.

04:23.875 --> 04:26.500
I don't want half of your money.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.792
I think $5,000 is all I'll need
to start again.

04:42.750 --> 04:47.042
I honestly don't know what got
into me, but I'm glad that it did.

04:51.292 --> 04:52.958
Stop that.

04:56.083 --> 05:00.250
I can't justify staying with you anymore
just to be nice.

39:10.625 --> 39:13.208
Because I saw it on your iPad
when it was syncing

39:13.292 --> 39:15.500
and then you deleted it from your phone!

39:15.583 --> 39:16.958
I don't know what you're talking about!

39:17.042 --> 39:19.792
How the fuck could you do this to me?

39:19.875 --> 39:22.083
It's really not what you think.

39:22.167 --> 39:26.708
Like I'm not going to have someone
follow you when you're acting like this?

39:26.792 --> 39:30.000
I stay in hotels all over the world!

39:30.083 --> 39:32.000
Not in our fucking neighborhood!

39:34.958 --> 39:36.458
Calm down.

39:39.083 --> 39:41.958
I don't have time for this.

39:42.042 --> 39:43.500
You're hysterical.

56:53.708 --> 56:56.167
Who is sick of everything regular?

57:14.083 --> 57:15.542
The public.
