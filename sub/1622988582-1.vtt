and take your pig with you.

21:13.097 --> 21:15.099
And I don't want to see
your face again, you understand?

21:15.186 --> 21:17.145
- I understand. I'm--
- Okay, good. Get going.

21:19.365 --> 21:21.584
[Valerian]
Yeah! Go home, Pig Girl!

21:21.671 --> 21:23.499
Get out of here, Pig Girl!

21:23.586 --> 21:26.110
[deep tone]
Yeah, get out, Pig Girl!

21:26.197 --> 21:28.591
- What was that? That was good.
- I don't know what that was.

21:28.678 --> 21:30.767
Hey, it's okay.

21:33.248 --> 21:34.815
- That is so annoying.
- Come on.

21:34.902 --> 21:37.252
She always ruins
everything for me.

21:37.339 --> 21:39.472
[Derek]
We'd better get going,
move on to the next set-up.

21:39.559 --> 21:40.734
I hear you, Derek, all good.

21:42.605 --> 21:44.172
- Jackson!
- Kenny.

21:44.259 --> 21:47.480
You okay? That was, I mean,
that was crazy, right?

21:47.567 --> 21:48.959
You bet. Real wild.

21:49.046 --> 21:50.134
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

21:50.221 --> 21:51.962
So, um, you, uh,
you wanna

21:52.049 --> 21:53.529
do you wanna practice
some of the stunts?

21:53.616 --> 21:55.444
I'll tell you what, Kenny,
uh, not right now.

21:55.531 --> 21:57.098
I gotta get back,
alright?

21:57.968 --> 21:59.187
Okay, cool, I just..

22:00.754 --> 22:02.712
Say, you know who that
girl was back there?

22:02.799 --> 22:04.627
I don't know, just some local.

22:15.421 --> 22:19.555
Pork chop, pork loin,
spare ribs, bacon.

22:21.557 --> 22:23.733
Is everybody happy?

22:23.820 --> 22:25.953
Oh, don't take that tone
with me, little Pig Girl.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.476
If you had just done
what I asked

22:27.563 --> 22:29.304
you wouldn't have been
humiliated.

22:29.391 --> 22:31.654
Yeah, now I have to prepare
all over again for my audition.

22:31.741 --> 22:32.829
Did you get any ham?

22:33.743 --> 22:35.005
[sighs]

22:35.092 --> 22:36.746
[upbeat music]

22:38.313 --> 22:40.707
[indistinct chatter]

22:42.361 --> 22:43.710
- Great day.
- Good day.

22:43.797 --> 22:45.712
Well, I mean, you were good.

22:45.799 --> 22:47.278
We have to find
our legs on our end

22:47.366 --> 22:48.367
but this is
how this stuff goes.

22:48.454 --> 22:49.933
You know, it takes
the first week.

22:50.020 --> 22:52.632
Jackson, hi. Wardrobe would like
you to try these on.

22:52.719 --> 22:55.069
Uh, sure, but did they have
this color back then?

22:55.156 --> 22:56.853
- I don't know.
- You don't like this?

22:56.940 --> 22:59.029
- I don't think it plays.
- Yeah, I'm with you.

22:59.116 --> 23:01.336
Thank you. Appreciate that.
Great work today.

23:01.423 --> 23:03.033
- Sorry, man.
- Um..

23:03.120 --> 23:04.861
Quickly, I can have him fired
if he's annoying you.

23:04.948 --> 23:06.123
- No! No, no. I don't wanna--
- Are you sure?

23:06.210 --> 23:07.864
- Excuse me, excuse me, Trevor.
- Yeah?

23:07.951 --> 23:09.910
For the flashback, which one?

23:09.997 --> 23:11.302
- Neither.
- Both.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.217
- Um, so, tomorrow's a big day.
- Yeah.

23:13.304 --> 23:15.481
And I'm thinking
for that scene, um--

23:15.568 --> 23:17.570
Okay, hold on a second, Trevor.
I've got to ask you something.

23:17.657 --> 23:19.136
- Alright.
- Tell me.

23:19.223 --> 23:20.486
Talk to me. I'm here.

23:20.573 --> 23:22.966
That girl today
from the audition.

23:23.053 --> 23:25.578
- The wild, muddy mess.
- Pig Girl?

23:25.665 --> 23:27.841
Don't...please don't
call her that.

23:27.928 --> 23:32.019
No, no, no! I don't call her
that. That's what they call her.

23:32.106 --> 23:33.760
They call her "Pig Girl."
I would never call her that.

23:33.847 --> 23:35.979
Look, listen, um..

23:36.066 --> 23:38.634
Do you think we can find
out who she is?

23:38.721 --> 23:40.897
- You think we should sue her?
- No.

23:40.984 --> 23:43.683
No, I, look, I-I-I just can't
get her out of my head.

23:45.685 --> 23:47.556
Why? You spent, like,
20 seconds with her.

23:47.643 --> 23:50.124
Okay, and it was the first
real 20 seconds I've had

23:50.211 --> 23:51.604
since I started this business.

23:55.651 --> 23:58.262
Aw, come on, man.

23:58.349 --> 24:00.395
You little sucker, come on.

24:00.482 --> 24:03.093
Okay, Trev, look, I-I-I don't
mean it like that. Alright?

24:03.180 --> 24:05.008
What I mean i-is this..

24:05.095 --> 24:06.749
...all of this nonsense

24:06.836 --> 24:09.404
alright, it does,
it doesn't speak to me.

24:09.491 --> 24:11.972
That beautiful girl back there
with the pig, she spoke to me.

24:14.148 --> 24:15.932
Okay, Jackson.

24:16.019 --> 24:19.153
Listen, you want to go frolic
in a pigsty..

24:19.240 --> 24:20.415
...I want that for you.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.548
I think it's important, okay?

24:22.635 --> 24:25.115
But right now we gotta focus.
It's a lot of pressure.

24:25.202 --> 24:26.508
This is a big movie
and we're going to do this

24:26.595 --> 24:28.641
because we're a team, right?

24:28.728 --> 24:30.338
We're going to finish
this movie

24:30.425 --> 24:33.646
and then you and I are gonna
dive into my next movie.

24:33.733 --> 24:36.257
And then, you are going to be
an A-list star

24:36.344 --> 24:39.782
and you can pick
any chick you want.

24:39.869 --> 24:42.132
- Mm.
- Right? You understand?

24:42.219 --> 24:45.309
[imitates gunshots]
Tomorrow's a big day.

24:45.396 --> 24:48.225
Let's get some rest.
Boom!

24:48.312 --> 24:49.618
- You're the man.
- You got it, Trev.

'You are the man.'

'Today was
a really bad day, dad.'

24:58.584 --> 25:00.237
They all called me "Pig Girl."

25:02.370 --> 25:03.502
Yeah.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.288
This was my only chance.

25:08.724 --> 25:10.552
[sighs]

25:10.639 --> 25:12.119
It's never
gonna happen, is it?

[pig grunts]

25:16.471 --> 25:19.169
And you!

25:19.256 --> 25:21.781
[chuckles]
You owe me big-time, Jon Ham.

25:23.173 --> 25:24.435
You do.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.789
[birds chirping]

25:31.355 --> 25:33.401
You're lucky they didn't
ban us from auditioning

25:33.488 --> 25:35.969
after your little stunt. Ow!

25:36.056 --> 25:38.362
You have any idea what a day
like that can cost production?

25:38.449 --> 25:40.408
100k, easy.

25:40.495 --> 25:43.237
Okay, well, they don't even
know that we're related, Kale.

25:43.324 --> 25:44.847
Okay, let's keep it that way.

25:44.934 --> 25:46.675
- Stop!
- Hold still.

25:46.762 --> 25:48.285
If anyone finds out
you're Pig Girl

25:48.372 --> 25:49.548
you'll ruin it for all of us.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.028
Wow.

25:52.115 --> 25:53.421
Is that what you're wearing?

25:53.508 --> 25:54.857
I don't take fashion advice

25:54.944 --> 25:56.990
from people who are
covered in pig poop.

25:58.731 --> 26:00.733
- Burn.
- You like that?

26:00.820 --> 26:03.039
Okay, don't wait up for us.

26:03.126 --> 26:05.259
I'm sure we'll be invited
to the after-party.

26:05.346 --> 26:07.130
Oh, there's no after-party.

26:07.217 --> 26:08.523
There's always an after-party.

26:08.610 --> 26:10.307
[Saffron]
That's after you
finish the job.

26:10.394 --> 26:12.440

I don't know what to say.

26:43.036 --> 26:44.428
There's something about it
that I just--

26:44.515 --> 26:45.691
- I'll be back.
- This is pretty cool.

26:47.344 --> 26:48.781
No, maybe you're right,
maybe it's awful.

26:48.868 --> 26:50.217
Yeah.

26:50.304 --> 26:52.001
Great job, Terry and Tina.

26:52.088 --> 26:55.439
Loved that. Oh, and loved those
little congas and the washboard.

26:55.526 --> 26:57.354
We're gonna get
to you guys very soon, okay?

26:57.441 --> 26:59.182

that I've ever wanted

27:07.538 --> 27:11.368
in my entire life and it
is never going to happen.

27:15.590 --> 27:16.722
Exactly. Thank you, Jon Ham.

27:16.809 --> 27:18.158
He gets it, you guys.

27:18.245 --> 27:20.682
I mean, the director
literally said to me

27:20.769 --> 27:23.642
that he never wants to see
my face again.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.252
So..

That was, ah, that was
surprisingly good.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.634
Real nice work, man.

31:37.721 --> 31:39.288
That was my favorite
show growing up.

31:41.073 --> 31:42.726
What's your name, kid?

31:42.813 --> 31:45.381
Huh. Fin...Fin..

31:46.600 --> 31:48.602
[coughs]

31:48.689 --> 31:51.779
Uh, last name, Finn.

31:51.866 --> 31:53.302
First name, uh..

31:53.389 --> 31:57.045
[clears throat]
...Huckleberry?

31:57.132 --> 31:58.177
Yeah.

31:58.264 --> 31:59.874
You know, my-my parents were

31:59.961 --> 32:02.181
real Mark Twain fans, you know?
So..

32:02.268 --> 32:03.182
- Oh..
- Alright.

32:03.269 --> 32:05.314
You know. Yeah, yeah.

32:06.054 --> 32:08.143
But, um..

32:08.230 --> 32:09.536
...you all can call me "Huck."

32:10.754 --> 32:12.669
- Okay.
- Huck.

32:14.889 --> 32:16.804
So, the following people
have been chosen

32:16.891 --> 32:18.066
Caletta Rose..

32:18.153 --> 32:19.285
[screaming]

32:19.372 --> 32:20.547
Great. Great, great, great.

32:20.634 --> 32:22.418
And, uh, Saffron Tremaine..

32:22.505 --> 32:23.637
[screaming]

32:23.724 --> 32:26.335
And Huck Finn.
Great.

32:26.422 --> 32:29.338
Oops, sorry, folks.
Hold tight, just a second.

32:29.425 --> 32:30.687
Yes?

32:32.080 --> 32:33.255
What?

32:34.648 --> 32:36.563
How?

32:36.650 --> 32:38.826
[instrumental music]

32:40.088 --> 32:42.134
- I can't wait..
- Ahh! A-ahem!

32:42.221 --> 32:43.483
To work you.

32:44.832 --> 32:47.182
You mean, work with me.

32:48.923 --> 32:50.272
Whatever.

32:53.058 --> 32:55.669
We lost the farm house.

32:55.756 --> 32:57.149
What do you mean
we lost the farm house?

32:57.236 --> 32:59.499
- Where did it go?
- It collapsed.

32:59.586 --> 33:01.501
I just saw it yesterday, Bernie.

33:01.588 --> 33:02.893
Well, it's gone today.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.591
We shoot the farm house
in two days!

33:04.678 --> 33:06.288
How are we going to
find another location?

33:06.375 --> 33:07.811
We're going to
figure something out.

33:07.898 --> 33:10.945
Ah-ah-ah!
If-if I may? Hi.

33:11.032 --> 33:13.121
Um, just happened to overhear.

33:13.208 --> 33:15.123
She's a patron of the arts.

33:15.210 --> 33:18.561
Yes, yes and I want
to proposition you.

33:21.173 --> 33:25.525
- She has a proposition for you.
- Yes.

33:25.612 --> 33:29.616
I just happen to be the owner of
a historical country farm house.

33:29.703 --> 33:31.444
True.

33:31.531 --> 33:37.711
And we have a barn, and a
chicken coop, chickens, goats

33:37.798 --> 33:40.018
filing cabinets,
hay, lots of hay..

33:40.105 --> 33:41.802
Big property.
It's a big property.

33:41.889 --> 33:43.760
The kind that you would need
for a production of this size.

33:43.847 --> 33:45.980
Brass tacks, boys.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.590
How much is it going
to cost me

33:47.677 --> 33:49.114
to have you shoot
your movie at my place?

33:49.201 --> 33:51.768
No, no, she's kidding,
she's kidding.

33:51.855 --> 33:53.727
They pay us, not
the other way around.

33:53.814 --> 33:55.903
Why don't we just say
that you give us, uh..

33:55.990 --> 33:58.297
I don't know, 125 percent of
what you were going to pay

33:58.384 --> 34:02.823
the house that you lost, throw
in some...catered lunches

34:02.910 --> 34:05.347
hot, then you have
yourself a deal.

34:09.569 --> 34:10.786
Sure.

34:10.873 --> 34:13.181
[instrumental music]

34:25.193 --> 34:26.237
Guys!

34:28.327 --> 34:29.502
They're here.

34:31.199 --> 34:32.199
Saffron?

34:33.549 --> 34:34.594
Kale?

34:34.681 --> 34:36.726
[instrumental music]

34:44.864 --> 34:46.735
- Morning.
- Oh, have a seat, have a seat.

34:49.696 --> 34:51.610
[clears throat]

34:51.697 --> 34:54.657
You know, I actually
saw your last movie.

34:54.744 --> 34:56.659
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

34:59.923 --> 35:01.186
- Okay.
- Seen the PR.

35:01.273 --> 35:02.796
That you're doing
for this one here.

35:02.883 --> 35:04.058
It's my house, actually.

35:04.145 --> 35:07.583
Oh. You got a real
nice piece of land.

35:07.670 --> 35:10.412
- Say, how many horses do you..
- I don't know.

35:10.499 --> 35:12.936
I figure I should
be managing you.

35:13.023 --> 35:14.590
- How's that?
- Well, do you have a manager?

35:14.677 --> 35:16.114
- I do not.
- You do now.

35:18.464 --> 35:19.813
What type of managing
do you do?

35:19.900 --> 35:21.902
Ever heard of Wanda's Waffle
and Sushi House?

35:21.989 --> 35:23.425
I can't say I've
had the pleasure.

35:23.512 --> 35:25.297
You will.
Listen, are you a meat guy?

35:25.384 --> 35:27.690
You could be the face
of Jon Ham Bacon.

35:27.777 --> 35:29.605
It's kind of a side
project I'm working on.

35:29.692 --> 35:32.260
Look, I, um, I don't think
I really need a manager.

35:32.347 --> 35:34.784
Not a meat guy?
Surprising.

35:34.871 --> 35:36.482
Uh, how about tractors?

35:36.569 --> 35:38.788
I'm working on a deal
with a local company here.

35:38.875 --> 35:40.442
Uh, thank you, but no.

35:40.529 --> 35:41.878
No. Okay moving on,
moving on.

35:41.965 --> 35:43.184
I got you, though.
I got you with this one?

35:43.271 --> 35:45.752
- Hmm?
- Money.

35:45.839 --> 35:48.233
Everybody likes money, right?
I'm in with the banks.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.409
"Need a loan,
call Jackson Stone."

35:50.496 --> 35:52.280
This is all from my head, man.
I'm just winging it.

35:52.367 --> 35:53.455
- I'm winging it, man.
- Wow.

35:53.542 --> 35:55.327
- Apologies, apologies.
- Okay, yup.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.504
You're a little all over
the place, ain't ya?

36:01.376 --> 36:03.596
You need an animal like me
in your corner, Jackson.

36:04.945 --> 36:06.033
Hmm.

36:07.600 --> 36:08.775
[sighs]

36:12.431 --> 36:13.432
Let's do this.

36:13.519 --> 36:14.781
[cellphone chimes]

36:19.742 --> 36:21.788
[sighing]

36:21.875 --> 36:24.573
Wish me luck, Jon Ham.
Love you.

36:25.966 --> 36:27.228
Okay, Jackson,

36:27.315 --> 36:29.752
So, you just shot
all these guys.

36:29.839 --> 36:31.406
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.

36:31.493 --> 36:32.842
- And now you're out of ammo.
- Hmm.

36:33.800 --> 36:34.931
Right? Okay.

36:35.018 --> 36:37.151
And from behind you
comes this guy.

36:37.238 --> 36:40.067
- Yeah. Hey, buddy.
- Kenny.

36:40.154 --> 36:42.722
Okay. A one-on-one.
So, uh, Kenny?

36:42.809 --> 36:44.158
You just, you just grab him.

36:44.245 --> 36:45.290
Okay. How do you want me
to approach it?

36:45.377 --> 36:47.161
I could do, like, a step over

36:47.248 --> 36:49.859
toe-hold sleeper, or-or I could
do a figure-four arm lock.

36:49.946 --> 36:52.558
Yeah, that-that's great.
You just go for him.

36:52.645 --> 36:55.996
Just...just come for me, Kenny.

36:56.083 --> 36:57.867
That's hot, that's hot,
that's hot, that's hot.

36:57.954 --> 37:00.130
- No, uh, um..
- Hi!

37:00.218 --> 37:03.438
I'm just not really
comfortable winging it.

37:05.048 --> 37:06.224
Okay.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.313
Fine.

37:09.270 --> 37:11.229
Huck!

37:11.316 --> 37:12.578
Huck, hey. Hello?

37:14.188 --> 37:16.059
Oh. Ahem.

37:16.146 --> 37:18.714
Yeah, uh, I'm so,
so sorry, folks.

37:18.801 --> 37:21.587
Huck. Huck is here.
Yeah.

37:21.674 --> 37:22.892
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

37:22.979 --> 37:24.242
Uh, you ever do any stunts?

37:25.199 --> 37:27.288
Oh, yeah.

37:27.375 --> 37:30.117
Two, two years
of gymnastics, so.

37:30.204 --> 37:32.598
That's, that's good.
Uh, go for him.

37:32.685 --> 37:34.469
Uh, he's not,
he's not in the union...

37:34.556 --> 37:35.862
No, that's fine.
Thanks, Kenny.

37:35.949 --> 37:37.255
Just go.
Just go for him.

37:37.342 --> 37:39.387
Uh-uh, okay.

37:39.474 --> 37:40.649
- Yeah. Right now?
- Yeah.

37:40.736 --> 37:41.868
- Alright.
- From back there.

37:41.955 --> 37:43.304
Yeah.

37:44.436 --> 37:45.611
- Ready?
- Yes, I am.

37:45.698 --> 37:46.786
Ready.

37:48.962 --> 37:50.485
- Yeah.
- That's perfect.

37:50.572 --> 37:52.095
- That's great, that's great.
- Alright.

37:52.182 --> 37:54.620
Oh, well, i-it's okay.
You see, I could do that!

37:54.707 --> 37:56.361
I just thought you
wanted something..

37:56.448 --> 37:58.711
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

37:58.798 --> 38:01.061
Actually, I'm thinking,
Kenny, maybe you, uh

38:01.148 --> 38:02.628
might want to have
a break there.

38:02.715 --> 38:04.847
- Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool.
- Yeah, yeah.

38:04.934 --> 38:07.110
Yeah. It's probably tired from
all that work. Thanks, buddy.

38:09.939 --> 38:13.595
Uh, thank you, you know,
for going easy on me.

38:13.682 --> 38:16.381
Ah, well, you know,
I got little cousins

38:16.468 --> 38:17.643
we used to play fight
all the time.

38:17.730 --> 38:19.297
That's all this is,
you know?

38:19.384 --> 38:22.212
- Yeah.
- Anyhow, you're a lightweight.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.389
What do you weigh?
About 130-135?

38:24.476 --> 38:26.129
123, thank..

38:26.216 --> 38:29.829
[clears throat]
Thank you very much.

38:29.916 --> 38:32.527
- That was a joke.
- I gotcha.

38:32.614 --> 38:34.355
You were so good.

38:34.442 --> 38:35.878
[Trevor]
'Let's shoot this.'

38:35.965 --> 38:38.533
And remember, we're going
to do this in a one-er.

38:38.620 --> 38:41.188
Which means we're going to shoot
the whole scene in one shot.

38:41.275 --> 38:44.322
Okay? Everyone, remember here,
timing is everything.

38:44.409 --> 38:46.062
So, if even one piece
of the puzzle is off

38:46.149 --> 38:47.281
the whole thing falls apart.

38:47.368 --> 38:48.717
So that's, so, what is

38:48.804 --> 38:50.415
what is that?
Is that a phone?

38:50.502 --> 38:52.939
- Bernie, Bernie, Bernie!
- Phones off! Please!

38:53.026 --> 38:54.549
- Come on, guys.
- Sorry, guys. Sorry.

38:54.636 --> 38:56.508
- That's alright. We get it.
- All good.

38:56.595 --> 38:59.032
So, Jackson, I want you
to enter from over there, okay?

38:59.119 --> 39:01.295
And, Huck, uh, you can
go around the corner

39:01.382 --> 39:04.298
and wait for your cue, okay?
Now, listen, don't miss this.

39:04.385 --> 39:06.387
If you miss it, you're going
to screw up the whole take

39:06.474 --> 39:08.041
and then I'll have to beat
the crap out of you.

39:10.391 --> 39:12.350
[chuckles]
I'm joking, I'm joking.

39:12.437 --> 39:14.526
But I will fire you.

39:14.613 --> 39:16.832
So there's that,
you could get fired.

39:16.919 --> 39:18.660
- That's not a joke.
- No, that one's not joking.

39:18.747 --> 39:20.096
- Yes.
- Okay, good. Good luck.

39:20.183 --> 39:21.881
See you on the other side.
Here we go.

39:21.968 --> 39:23.143
Let's try one.

39:23.230 --> 39:26.059
Okay, lock it up!
Roll sound!

39:28.496 --> 39:29.584
Oh, my gosh.

39:29.671 --> 39:31.194
- 'And action.'
- Hi. Okay.

39:31.281 --> 39:33.501
I know I look
very, very strange.

39:33.588 --> 39:36.243
I'm going to have to do
this real quick.

39:36.330 --> 39:39.202
Good girl.
Good girl.

39:39.289 --> 39:41.509
[Valerian]
'Finley!'

39:41.596 --> 39:42.554
What?

39:44.817 --> 39:45.861
[sighing]

39:48.124 --> 39:51.345
No, no, no, no, no. No.

39:51.432 --> 39:53.303
Alright.

39:53.391 --> 39:54.740
[Valerian]
'Finley!'

39:55.958 --> 39:57.786
[cow moos]

40:02.922 --> 40:04.097
[goat bleats]

40:06.578 --> 40:07.535
Yes.

40:11.496 --> 40:14.803
[Valerian]
Where are you?
Where have you been?

40:14.890 --> 40:17.371
You told me to milk the cow,
so I'm milking the cow.

40:17.458 --> 40:18.677
Is that what you're doing?

40:18.764 --> 40:20.983
- Yeah.
- That is disgusting.

40:21.070 --> 40:23.943
Yeah. Yeah.

40:24.030 --> 40:25.335
You know what? It only gets

40:25.423 --> 40:26.772
really worse from here,
so you should probably

40:26.859 --> 40:29.905
just go, like, right now.
Like, right now!

40:29.992 --> 40:32.952
- You should go.
- Fine. I'm leaving.

40:33.039 --> 40:35.171
There's got to be a better
way to get the milk out.

40:37.696 --> 40:38.871
[Valerian]
'Hi!'

40:38.958 --> 40:40.916
- Hi.
- How's the filming going?

40:41.003 --> 40:42.048
Filming's going well. We're
actually rolling right now.

40:42.135 --> 40:43.571
Oh, rolling?
Okay, shh, she, shh.

40:43.658 --> 40:45.138
- Rolling! Rolling.
- Yeah.

40:46.356 --> 40:48.707
I owe you. Okay.

40:48.794 --> 40:50.970
Jackson! Jackson.
Your cue, please.

40:51.057 --> 40:52.188
Now, please.

40:54.669 --> 40:55.757
[grunting]

40:55.844 --> 40:56.758
Oh!

41:05.419 --> 41:07.552
[sighs]
Seriously?

41:09.684 --> 41:12.426
Alright. You wanna play.
Let's play.

41:14.646 --> 41:17.083
Come on, come on.
Who's a good boy?

41:17.170 --> 41:19.477
Are you a good boy?
Come on. Come on.

41:19.564 --> 41:22.480
Let go. Let go!
Thank you.

41:22.567 --> 41:24.351
[gunshots]

41:26.135 --> 41:27.746
Hope that was worth
getting shot for.

41:30.705 --> 41:32.098
[grunting]

41:45.241 --> 41:46.939
Huck, you nailed that.

41:47.026 --> 41:48.767
You nailed that timing.
That's what I'm talking about.

41:48.854 --> 41:50.246

- That round-the-corner wave.

41:50.333 --> 41:51.683
You didn't miss it.
You nailed it.

Really, uh, really nice
work today.

Thank you, you know, so much.
I.. I'm not gonna lie.

42:46.302 --> 42:48.130
I'm sorta freaking out
that Trevor let me do

42:48.217 --> 42:50.350
that scene with you.

42:50.437 --> 42:53.875
Listen, listen. He let you
do it because you're good.

42:53.962 --> 42:55.529
Alright, you're not afraid
to just go for it.

42:55.616 --> 42:57.749
That takes balls.

42:57.836 --> 42:59.315
Yeah, I-I got, I got those.

43:00.360 --> 43:02.884
So, um...

43:02.971 --> 43:05.234
what do you do
for fun around here?

43:05.321 --> 43:07.672
Oh, ah..

43:07.759 --> 43:10.109
There's a really nice lake,
actually. You can go fishing.

43:10.892 --> 43:13.242
Hmm.

43:13.329 --> 43:18.030
I-I'm sorry. You, um, you
probably meant for a night life.

43:18.117 --> 43:20.206
Yeah, I'm looking for
a hot after-hours club.

43:21.337 --> 43:23.035

43:23.122 --> 43:24.297
Here, sit.

43:25.820 --> 43:27.430
- Thanks.
- No problem.

43:28.649 --> 43:30.259
That lake sounds real nice.

43:34.916 --> 43:36.309
Man..

43:38.137 --> 43:41.401
You must just wake up and pinch
yourself every single day.

43:43.708 --> 43:45.013
Now how's that?

43:47.102 --> 43:51.411
I-I mean, you-you get to travel
the world, you know, for free.

43:51.498 --> 43:53.718
You live the dream
of every single actor.

these great parts

best directors.

43:56.808 --> 43:59.332

- Hmm.

43:59.419 --> 44:02.422
Nah, look the truth is..

44:04.293 --> 44:05.904
...I'd give all this up

44:05.991 --> 44:07.688
to be back at my uncle's ranch.

44:14.129 --> 44:17.480
Yeah. That sounds real nice.

44:17.567 --> 44:22.181
Hey, Jackson, I'm sorry,
I, I gotta ask, um..

44:24.662 --> 44:26.272
How did you get here?

44:27.577 --> 44:29.536
Ah, well, ah..

44:31.059 --> 44:33.671
It was like in the movies.

44:33.758 --> 44:35.847
A Hollywood producer
and his wife showed up

44:35.934 --> 44:38.980
and discovered me.

44:39.067 --> 44:42.767
Now I got two more movies
lined up after this one, and..

44:42.854 --> 44:45.073
you know, all I want to do
is get back on the ranch, so..

44:47.206 --> 44:49.338

gonna do, right?

1:00:45.816 --> 1:00:46.947
I was just hoping
maybe you'd take a look

1:00:47.034 --> 1:00:49.689
at this contract that I drew up.

1:00:49.776 --> 1:00:51.082
[Jackson]
'Hey, hey, hey, hold on now.'

1:00:51.169 --> 1:00:52.257
Hold on to this water
for me, too, bud.

1:00:52.344 --> 1:00:53.737
Thanks. I'll be right with you.

1:00:53.824 --> 1:00:55.042
Well, I'll hold that.
I'll be right here.

1:00:55.129 --> 1:00:56.435
And she rides, too.

1:00:56.522 --> 1:00:57.784
[Finley]
You want me? Come and get me.

1:00:59.177 --> 1:01:01.266
- Hold on.
- 'Come on, boy.'

1:01:01.353 --> 1:01:02.746
Let's go. Come on, boy.

1:01:02.833 --> 1:01:04.095
Let's go. Come on.

1:01:04.182 --> 1:01:06.184
[horse neighs]

1:01:06.271 --> 1:01:08.142
Come on, let's go. Come on. Hey.

1:01:10.405 --> 1:01:13.278
[instrumental music]

1:01:18.892 --> 1:01:20.285
[Jackson]
Come on. Hyah! Hyah!

1:01:25.246 --> 1:01:26.334
[Jackson]
Hyah! Come on.

1:01:27.596 --> 1:01:28.989
[Finley]
Come on, boy.

1:01:29.076 --> 1:01:30.382
[Jackson]
Hey, hey, hold up!

1:01:32.166 --> 1:01:35.039
[horses galloping]

1:01:38.825 --> 1:01:40.435
It's okay, it's okay,
it's alright.

1:01:43.308 --> 1:01:44.613
Who are you?

1:01:46.485 --> 1:01:48.226
I think we might have
a little bit of a problem

1:01:48.313 --> 1:01:50.228
with Jackson and Finley.

1:01:50.315 --> 1:01:52.273
The only problem we have

1:01:52.360 --> 1:01:54.362
is that you haven't managed
to sign him yet.

1:01:54.449 --> 1:01:56.277
God, mom, that is so unfair.

1:01:56.364 --> 1:01:57.931
He's impossible to get to.

1:01:58.018 --> 1:01:59.977
He's either on set working
or hanging out with Huck.

1:02:00.064 --> 1:02:01.935
I'm starting to honestly think
that those two might be..

1:02:02.022 --> 1:02:03.328
...you know,
which would be very cute.

1:02:03.415 --> 1:02:06.026
Um, that is totally ridiculous.

1:02:06.113 --> 1:02:08.246
I happen to know
Huck is into girls

1:02:08.333 --> 1:02:11.031
because when he kissed me,
it was so..

1:02:13.294 --> 1:02:15.775
Right. There's also something
fishy going on

1:02:15.862 --> 1:02:17.168
between Finley and Huck.

1:02:17.255 --> 1:02:18.647
[chuckles]
Okay.

1:02:18.735 --> 1:02:21.694
Huck would never
be interested in Finley!

1:02:21.781 --> 1:02:24.001
I didn't say
Huck was interested in Finley

1:02:24.088 --> 1:02:25.742
I said Jackson was.

1:02:27.569 --> 1:02:30.007
[Valerian]
Oh! Oh..

1:02:30.094 --> 1:02:31.922
I don't think we need to worry

1:02:32.009 --> 1:02:34.489
about the Pig Girl.

1:02:34.576 --> 1:02:37.579
Okay, listen, I can only hear
one conversation at a time.

1:02:37.666 --> 1:02:40.104
Does anyone have eyes
on Jackson and Huck?

1:02:41.235 --> 1:02:42.454
Alright.

1:02:44.108 --> 1:02:46.588
There we go, there we go.

1:02:46.675 --> 1:02:47.851
It's okay. Oh! Ow!

1:02:49.156 --> 1:02:52.029
Come on. Come on. Attaboy.

1:02:52.116 --> 1:02:54.466
Ah, she got away from us
this time.

1:02:54.553 --> 1:02:57.512
That's alright.
We'll get her next time.

1:02:57.599 --> 1:02:58.992
You're a good horse.

1:03:01.081 --> 1:03:03.431
You're a good boy, alright?

1:03:03.518 --> 1:03:05.390
You're alright. You just shied
away from that jump today.

1:03:05.477 --> 1:03:07.261
It's okay.

1:03:07.348 --> 1:03:08.959
'I can teach you.'

1:03:09.046 --> 1:03:11.526
'You know, I had a gelding
just like you back home.'

1:03:11.613 --> 1:03:13.006
How about a treat?

1:03:13.093 --> 1:03:14.312
Let's get you a treat.

1:03:17.054 --> 1:03:18.359
Yeah, these will do.

1:03:20.927 --> 1:03:22.276
What do you say, hmm?

1:03:22.363 --> 1:03:25.976
Yeah. There you go.

1:03:26.063 --> 1:03:28.413
I can do almost everything,
but I can't control the weather

1:03:28.500 --> 1:03:31.024
so just get me
a rain-cover set ASAP.

1:03:31.111 --> 1:03:32.634
- Bernie!
- Oh!

1:03:32.721 --> 1:03:34.549
Okay, I've got Huck.

1:03:34.636 --> 1:03:37.988
I still need a 20 on Jackson.
Trevor's been looking for you.

1:03:38.075 --> 1:03:39.990
Please don't wander off
like that again, okay?

1:03:40.077 --> 1:03:42.122
Yeah, I won't.
I am so sorry about that. Sorry.

1:03:42.209 --> 1:03:43.907
- Go talk to him.
- Oh, everything, though..

1:03:43.994 --> 1:03:45.517
- Everything is great.
- Okay.

1:03:48.259 --> 1:03:50.130
- Jackson.
- Hey, where ya been?

1:03:50.217 --> 1:03:52.567
Where have you been?

1:03:52.654 --> 1:03:54.004
I've just been
checking out the property.

1:03:54.091 --> 1:03:56.310
Mm, yeah, it's a..

1:03:56.397 --> 1:03:58.617
...real nice piece of land.

1:03:58.704 --> 1:04:00.401
Beautiful, you could say, yeah.

1:04:00.488 --> 1:04:02.099
Yeah, real beautiful.

1:04:02.186 --> 1:04:04.318
I'd like to find me
a place like this some day.

1:04:04.405 --> 1:04:05.798
That would be real nice,
real nice.

1:04:05.885 --> 1:04:07.365
Jackson? Huck?

1:04:07.452 --> 1:04:09.323
- Mm?
- Let's huddle up.

1:04:09.410 --> 1:04:11.325
I heard "Huddle up."
That's me, right?

1:04:11.412 --> 1:04:12.936
You guys need me for this one?

1:04:13.023 --> 1:04:14.589
No, Kenny, we're fine.

1:04:14.676 --> 1:04:15.982
- Yeah, let's go.
- Alright.

1:04:17.027 --> 1:04:18.202
Alright.

1:04:21.466 --> 1:04:22.859
[clears throat]

1:04:24.599 --> 1:04:26.036
Okay.

1:04:26.123 --> 1:04:27.559
Ah-ah-ah!

1:04:31.345 --> 1:04:33.695
The chemistry
between you two on camera..

1:04:34.696 --> 1:04:37.351
...is-is-is magical.

1:04:39.310 --> 1:04:41.138
It's weird.

1:04:43.401 --> 1:04:46.360
So, I'm going to take
a chance on you, Huck.

1:04:46.447 --> 1:04:48.449
I'm giving you the part
that I was going to give Kenny.

1:04:50.538 --> 1:04:52.149
So..

1:04:52.236 --> 1:04:54.629
...this is
for the big finale scene.

1:04:55.456 --> 1:04:57.763
Take it.

1:04:57.850 --> 1:04:59.678
Now, we have
a company day off tomorrow

1:04:59.765 --> 1:05:02.333
so you go home, you work hard,
you memorize those lines

1:05:02.420 --> 1:05:04.117
and don't be late again.

1:05:04.204 --> 1:05:06.728
- No!
- Alright.

1:05:06.815 --> 1:05:08.817
No, no, sir, I-I won't.

1:05:08.905 --> 1:05:11.733
I promise.
This is everything to me.

1:05:11.820 --> 1:05:13.953
Well, well, you can thank
your pal, Jackson, here

1:05:14.040 --> 1:05:15.433
because it was his idea.

1:05:17.174 --> 1:05:18.566
There it is. Good luck!

1:05:18.653 --> 1:05:20.090
Bernie, shut it down.

1:05:20.177 --> 1:05:21.656
- 'Okay, we are moving on.'
- See you, Trev.

1:05:22.744 --> 1:05:24.050
Ahem.

1:05:27.053 --> 1:05:29.099
- Jackson, uh..
- What's up?

1:05:31.188 --> 1:05:32.929
Thank you.

1:05:33.016 --> 1:05:35.061
I don't even know what to say.

1:05:35.148 --> 1:05:36.976
No thanks needed.

1:05:37.063 --> 1:05:40.023
Ah, look, I-I owe you.

1:05:40.110 --> 1:05:42.547
Look, you saved me from having
to do the scene with Kenny.

1:05:42.634 --> 1:05:44.462
Alright?

1:05:44.549 --> 1:05:46.943
Uh, I-I really shouldn't
laugh at that

1:05:47.030 --> 1:05:49.902
because I really feel bad
for the poor guy, you know?

1:05:49.989 --> 1:05:51.512
Right.

1:05:52.383 --> 1:05:53.645
Uh..

1:05:54.428 --> 1:05:55.690
Huck, y-y-your..

1:05:55.777 --> 1:05:57.562
your-your mustache
is a little askew.

1:06:00.173 --> 1:06:01.653
Yeah.

1:06:01.740 --> 1:06:02.959
Oh, um..

1:06:05.787 --> 1:06:07.093
[chuckles]

1:06:07.180 --> 1:06:10.618
You know, Huck, I, uh

1:06:10.705 --> 1:06:12.011
I figured as much.

1:06:19.888 --> 1:06:21.194
You did?

1:06:21.978 --> 1:06:23.066
Yeah.

1:06:25.372 --> 1:06:26.983
You can't grow facial hair.

1:06:27.070 --> 1:06:28.288
So what?

1:06:30.247 --> 1:06:33.032
Yeah, yeah. Uh..

1:06:33.119 --> 1:06:35.687
I-I can't grow facial hair. I..

1:06:35.774 --> 1:06:37.689
Oh, it feels good to get that
off my chest, you know that?

1:06:37.776 --> 1:06:39.343
- You got that.
- Alright.

1:06:39.430 --> 1:06:41.258
It's 'cause I got such a,
such a babyface.

1:06:41.345 --> 1:06:42.911
You know what I mean?
To get the part

1:06:42.999 --> 1:06:44.391
I had to, had to look the part

1:06:44.478 --> 1:06:46.698
but, you know, you got me.

1:06:46.785 --> 1:06:48.961
Well, look, you're lucky.

1:06:49.048 --> 1:06:51.398
I'll tell you what, I feel like
I'm shaving this every day

1:06:51.485 --> 1:06:53.183
morning, noon and night,
you know what I'm saying?

1:06:53.270 --> 1:06:55.228
- One day.
- Right, right.

1:06:55.315 --> 1:06:56.882
Well, I'll tell you what, look

1:06:56.969 --> 1:06:59.363
your secret's safe with me.
Okay?

1:06:59.450 --> 1:07:01.321
Alright. That's good news,
yeah.

1:07:01.408 --> 1:07:02.583
I'll catch you later.

1:07:02.670 --> 1:07:03.976
- Thank you.
- See you, bud.

1:07:07.458 --> 1:07:08.589
[sighs]

1:07:10.156 --> 1:07:11.462
Oh, God.

1:07:12.332 --> 1:07:13.638
Oh, my God.

1:07:14.987 --> 1:07:17.033
[instrumental music]

1:07:18.556 --> 1:07:20.166
The best part is that
even though

1:07:20.253 --> 1:07:22.516
the lighting was really bad
the selfie was still really good

1:07:22.603 --> 1:07:23.952
and I just felt like,
I don't know--

1:07:24.040 --> 1:07:26.346
I, I am, I was gonna go
fishing tomorrow

1:07:26.433 --> 1:07:28.957
since, you know,
it's my day off. Sorry.

1:07:29.045 --> 1:07:30.220
You don't have a day off.

1:07:31.482 --> 1:07:33.266
I meant your day off.

1:07:33.353 --> 1:07:35.747
- Of filming, you know?
- Oh.

1:07:35.834 --> 1:07:37.009
I'll make breakfast first.

1:07:37.096 --> 1:07:38.837
- I want French Toast.
- Okay.

1:07:38.924 --> 1:07:40.839
Fine, whatever.
Just stop talking.

1:07:40.926 --> 1:07:42.058
Okay.

1:07:43.581 --> 1:07:45.626
Saffron, if the director

1:07:45.713 --> 1:07:47.367
pegged you as "Talent"

1:07:47.454 --> 1:07:49.152
why hasn't he given you
a bigger part?

1:07:49.239 --> 1:07:50.501
Mm!

1:07:50.588 --> 1:07:52.459
You don't know anything, mom.

1:07:52.546 --> 1:07:55.288
This is how
the film business works.

1:07:55.375 --> 1:07:58.335
Oh, I know
how monkey business works.

1:07:58.422 --> 1:08:00.859
What?

1:08:00.946 --> 1:08:04.123
Boys like Jackson
are only after one thing.

1:08:04.210 --> 1:08:05.864
[Finley]
That is not true!

1:08:05.951 --> 1:08:07.648
What is not true?

1:08:07.735 --> 1:08:09.911
How would youeven know?

1:08:09.998 --> 1:08:11.696
Yes, Finley. How would you?

1:08:12.697 --> 1:08:14.786
[chuckles]

1:08:14.873 --> 1:08:17.267
Because I, um..

1:08:19.486 --> 1:08:22.184
I overheard
Jackson and Huck talking

1:08:22.272 --> 1:08:24.100
when they were by the barn

1:08:24.187 --> 1:08:25.274
and they said
the director thinks

1:08:25.362 --> 1:08:26.885
Saffron is really talented

1:08:26.971 --> 1:08:28.495
and he wants
to make her part bigger.

1:08:28.582 --> 1:08:30.018
[laughs]

1:08:30.106 --> 1:08:31.497
[Valerian]
I knew it.

1:08:31.585 --> 1:08:33.413
Yeah, I don't buy it.

1:08:33.500 --> 1:08:35.415
I mean, no offense,
but we've all seen you act.

1:08:35.502 --> 1:08:37.068
Don't be jelly.

1:08:37.156 --> 1:08:39.593
Kale, she's right.

1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:41.769
It's not about
how you play the game

1:08:41.856 --> 1:08:43.902
it's about
whether or not you win.

1:08:43.988 --> 1:08:46.252
Potato potato.

1:08:46.339 --> 1:08:48.166
You do know
you have to say them differently

1:08:48.254 --> 1:08:49.690
for that phrase to work, right?

1:08:51.170 --> 1:08:54.085
[instrumental music]

1:09:00.048 --> 1:09:02.964
[Finley singing softly]

1:09:09.406 --> 1:09:10.885
[Jackson]
Do you mind if I join you?

1:09:10.971 --> 1:09:12.452
I'm so sorry!
I didn't know you were..

1:09:14.411 --> 1:09:16.978
Um..

1:09:17.065 --> 1:09:19.023
Do you know, the, uh,
the-the-the fish

1:09:19.111 --> 1:09:21.460
they just they're-they're really
not biting over here at all.

1:09:21.548 --> 1:09:24.029
I think if you, you know,
go up the lake a little bit

1:09:24.116 --> 1:09:26.596
like way down,
it would be better.

1:09:26.684 --> 1:09:29.381
Yeah, I think
I'll, uh, take my chances.

1:09:32.429 --> 1:09:33.473
Great.

1:09:35.606 --> 1:09:36.781
Um..

1:09:37.912 --> 1:09:39.435
Okay, well, um..

1:09:39.523 --> 1:09:41.002
have a, have a good day.

1:09:41.089 --> 1:09:42.874
- You leaving already?
- Yeah, yeah.

1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:44.657
- Is it something I said?
- No. No, no.

1:09:44.745 --> 1:09:47.226
Uh, no, no you, uh, you are..

1:09:47.313 --> 1:09:49.576
..fine. I, um..

1:09:49.663 --> 1:09:52.405
Good luck, you know,
with, uh, everything.

1:09:52.492 --> 1:09:53.841
Come on, now,
please don't go.

1:09:53.928 --> 1:09:56.148
I-I have to.
You know, I forgot my bait.

1:09:56.235 --> 1:09:57.496
You mean this bait?

1:10:00.457 --> 1:10:01.545
Yup.

1:10:02.327 --> 1:10:04.678
Yup, that, um..

1:10:04.764 --> 1:10:07.507
That'll be the one.
If you could just, you know..

1:10:07.594 --> 1:10:10.815
- Just right. Yeah.
- Thank you.

1:10:10.902 --> 1:10:12.295
Now you're probably wishing
you had that horse

1:10:12.382 --> 1:10:13.600
right about now, huh?

1:10:16.429 --> 1:10:17.822
And you're probably
thinking to yourself

1:10:17.909 --> 1:10:19.780
"Can I outrun him?"

1:10:19.867 --> 1:10:21.304
I don't think so.

1:10:21.391 --> 1:10:22.434
Look..

1:10:23.871 --> 1:10:26.004
I know it's you.

1:10:26.091 --> 1:10:28.441
- It isn't me.
- Yeah, it is.

1:10:28.528 --> 1:10:30.094
- No, it isn't--
- Yes, it is.

1:10:30.182 --> 1:10:32.271
- No, it isn't!
- Yes, it is.

1:10:32.358 --> 1:10:34.273
Fine.

1:10:34.360 --> 1:10:35.621
Yes, it's me.

1:10:37.885 --> 1:10:39.278
I'm so embarrassed right now.

1:10:39.365 --> 1:10:40.540
Embarrassed?

1:10:41.454 --> 1:10:42.499
For what?

1:10:43.848 --> 1:10:47.068
Sorry, do you not remember me?

1:10:47.155 --> 1:10:49.245
I'm the girl
that fell flat on her face

1:10:49.332 --> 1:10:51.202
when she was trying
to wrangle her pig.

1:10:51.290 --> 1:10:54.337
And I thought that was
some mighty fine pig wrangling.

1:10:54.424 --> 1:10:56.513
Okay. I wasn't there
to wrangle a pig.

1:10:57.905 --> 1:11:00.125
I was there to get
a part in your movie.

1:11:00.212 --> 1:11:01.735
Well, look.

1:11:01.822 --> 1:11:04.041
You're-you're going to get
another shot.

1:11:05.870 --> 1:11:07.654
Yeah, a plain girl
from Dreary, Idaho

1:11:07.741 --> 1:11:09.352
isn't getting another chance.

1:11:11.832 --> 1:11:13.443
Man..

1:11:13.530 --> 1:11:15.445
Look at me. Go on.

1:11:18.273 --> 1:11:20.014
There is nothing plain
about you.

1:11:23.366 --> 1:11:25.063
Now, will you come sit
and fish with me?

1:11:27.326 --> 1:11:29.067
I was here first, so.

1:11:32.897 --> 1:11:34.942
Yeah, keep staring at me,
I'll sell you both.

1:11:35.552 --> 1:11:36.901
Finley!

1:11:38.424 --> 1:11:41.340
Fin-ley! Anyone home?

1:11:41.427 --> 1:11:43.299
No.

1:11:45.083 --> 1:11:46.258
Sorry.

1:11:48.129 --> 1:11:49.434
[mud squelching]

1:11:49.522 --> 1:11:51.307
Oh!

1:11:51.394 --> 1:11:52.482
Fantastic.

1:11:57.182 --> 1:11:59.837

1:11:59.924 --> 1:12:01.099
[pig grunting]

1:12:01.186 --> 1:12:02.273
You.

1:12:05.321 --> 1:12:06.800
Shouldn't you be,
like, a sandwich

1:12:06.887 --> 1:12:07.844
or something by now?

1:12:07.932 --> 1:12:09.760
[grunts]

1:12:09.847 --> 1:12:12.066
Let's get something straight,
Jon Ham, I don't like you

1:12:12.153 --> 1:12:13.764
I don't like
your stupid little face..

1:12:13.851 --> 1:12:15.809
Okay, calm down.

1:12:15.896 --> 1:12:17.681
Bad pig. Bad pig! Bad pig!

1:12:17.768 --> 1:12:20.205
Get away from me, Fatty!
Get away!

1:12:22.076 --> 1:12:23.991
Hey, hey, hey, easy. Easy.

1:12:24.077 --> 1:12:26.994
[grunting]

1:12:32.085 --> 1:12:33.349
Oh!

1:12:37.135 --> 1:12:38.789
What are you smiling about?

1:12:40.312 --> 1:12:41.922
You just remind me of someone.

1:12:42.009 --> 1:12:44.577
Mm. A girl back home?

1:12:44.664 --> 1:12:46.927
No, no.
My friend, Huck, actually.

1:12:48.973 --> 1:12:50.975
Oh!

1:12:51.062 --> 1:12:52.803
Oh, that's, um

1:12:52.889 --> 1:12:54.108
that's-that's weird.

1:12:54.195 --> 1:12:55.458
Yeah, it's, uh..

1:12:55.545 --> 1:12:56.546
You know, uh, I don't mean

1:12:56.633 --> 1:12:57.895
that I think
you look like a boy.

1:12:57.982 --> 1:12:59.766
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I did not think

1:12:59.853 --> 1:13:01.202
that you were saying that, no.

1:13:01.289 --> 1:13:03.161
- You are a boy, right?
- I am.

1:13:03.248 --> 1:13:05.206
- Yeah. I'm a girl!
- You're a girl!

1:13:05.293 --> 1:13:07.469
Hold on, you've got
a piece of grass in your hair.

1:13:07.557 --> 1:13:09.428
Oh, sorry. Got it?

1:13:12.126 --> 1:13:13.344
Yeah.

1:13:15.129 --> 1:13:16.434
That was, uh..

1:13:16.522 --> 1:13:17.827
- That was, um..
- Weird.

1:13:17.915 --> 1:13:18.959
That was weird.

1:13:19.046 --> 1:13:20.744
But thanks.

1:13:24.008 --> 1:13:26.837
Seriously?
Where would Finley keep..

1:13:28.665 --> 1:13:30.144
Oh.

1:13:45.159 --> 1:13:46.204

So..

1:13:46.291 --> 1:13:48.335
- My-my friend.
- Mm? Huck?

1:13:48.424 --> 1:13:50.034
- Huck.
- Huck.

1:13:50.121 --> 1:13:51.992
Yeah, no, he's, um..

1:13:52.079 --> 1:13:53.907
- He's amazing.
- Oh.

1:13:53.994 --> 1:13:58.085
Really? He's, like, a,
like a good guy?

1:13:58.172 --> 1:14:00.130
Oh, yeah. No, he's a great guy.
I meant, he's..

1:14:00.218 --> 1:14:01.567
...he's an amazing actor.

1:14:04.004 --> 1:14:07.704
I'm-I'm sorry.
He's, like, an amazing actor?

1:14:07.791 --> 1:14:09.487
Hmm.

1:14:09.575 --> 1:14:12.709

You-you think that-that he's..

1:14:12.796 --> 1:14:14.058
...that he's that amazing?

1:14:14.145 --> 1:14:15.668
Like, he could, he could
go far or something

1:14:15.755 --> 1:14:17.757

That, is, like..

That is like,
this sounds so cool.

1:14:20.237 --> 1:14:21.544

1:14:21.630 --> 1:14:25.460
- You know, from..
- Right, right.

1:14:25.548 --> 1:14:28.768
That's really great for-for him,
you know?

[chuckles]
Yeah, I'll, uh..

1:14:31.728 --> 1:14:33.425
I'll let him know
how happy you are for him.

And, look,
I don't know about you

1:15:51.590 --> 1:15:53.287

I just don't think
you could keep up.

to them?

"...Huck"?

Why are we calling her "Huck"?

Did she change her name?

How am I related
to you people?

Look, I, uh, I..

to be in this movie, right and..

...the only way
that I could do that

1:18:26.049 --> 1:18:27.702
was to, uh..

1:18:27.790 --> 1:18:29.356
...disguise myself..

1:18:30.227 --> 1:18:31.402

Oh!

1:18:44.894 --> 1:18:47.723
That's why Huck didn't
ask me out after our kiss.

1:18:47.809 --> 1:18:49.246
- Saffron.
- 'Yeah?'

1:18:49.333 --> 1:18:51.074
There is no Huck.

all this time.

- No, no, no, no. Valerian, I--
- Look, shut up!

1:19:23.496 --> 1:19:25.021
This is what's going to happen.

1:19:25.108 --> 1:19:26.849
You are going to stay..

1:19:28.067 --> 1:19:29.982
...in the barn tonight..

1:21:50.296 --> 1:21:52.037
Okay, all departments

1:21:52.124 --> 1:21:54.996

Oh, where is he?

Not in Wardrobe.

1:22:15.017 --> 1:22:16.496
I think it needs to be tighter.

1:22:21.284 --> 1:22:22.371
Hmm.

1:22:22.459 --> 1:22:23.416
Okay, go to Circus

1:22:23.503 --> 1:22:24.809

1:22:24.896 --> 1:22:26.419
- Who's over at Catering?
- 'Uh, Cam.'

1:22:26.505 --> 1:22:28.030
Yeah. Both of you, just check.

1:22:28.117 --> 1:22:29.466
You realize this is your job

1:22:29.553 --> 1:22:30.771

[male #2 on radio]
'Okay, Bernie.'

I have an idea for you.
Uh, It's a good one.

Have you heard of Jon Ham..
Excuse me.

I'm his manager, by the way.

Hello!

1:23:15.120 --> 1:23:17.731
Anyone? Hello?

1:23:17.818 --> 1:23:19.951
It doesn't do a bird's-eye,
the thing doesn't make sense

1:23:20.038 --> 1:23:21.257
and that's what I'm saying..

1:23:21.344 --> 1:23:22.432
Did you find him?

1:23:22.519 --> 1:23:23.824
Went to voicemail.

I'm going to need
some sort of, um, sandwich.

I'm going to need a sandwich.

You show up there.

1:24:10.741 --> 1:24:12.047
You got some chocolate
on there.

Let's get rid of that.

Morning, y'all..

- Morning.
- What's going on?

1:24:20.577 --> 1:24:22.405
Well, looks like
we get to do our scene

1:24:22.492 --> 1:24:24.668
together after all, buddy.

1:24:24.755 --> 1:24:25.799
And how's that?

1:24:28.759 --> 1:24:29.934
Where's Huck?

1:24:30.891 --> 1:24:32.154
He didn't show.

1:24:32.241 --> 1:24:33.242
We can't reach him.

1:24:35.331 --> 1:24:36.809
So, we're going to go
with Kenny.

1:24:36.897 --> 1:24:38.029
Mm-hmm.

1:24:39.074 --> 1:24:40.423
We gotta shoot.

1:24:40.510 --> 1:24:41.815
[Trevor]
I understand, Bernie.

1:24:41.902 --> 1:24:43.861
Oh, this is your chance!

1:24:43.948 --> 1:24:45.384
Really?

1:24:45.471 --> 1:24:47.343
- Get over there.
- Really?

1:24:47.430 --> 1:24:49.475
Don't blow it again.

1:24:49.562 --> 1:24:51.521
[grunts]

1:24:51.608 --> 1:24:52.957
You're very hard on her.

1:24:56.395 --> 1:24:58.353
- Hi!
- Hi..

1:24:58.441 --> 1:24:59.659
Howdy, howdy, howdy.

1:24:59.746 --> 1:25:01.139
Oh. Ew.

1:25:01.226 --> 1:25:02.967
Listen, now is really
not the time.

1:25:03.054 --> 1:25:04.795
Oh, but, um..

1:25:04.882 --> 1:25:06.188
...I heard that you wanted
to make my part bigger..

1:25:06.275 --> 1:25:07.276
...and yes.

1:25:07.362 --> 1:25:08.625
I'm sorry, what?

1:25:08.712 --> 1:25:10.105
No, no, that's right,
that's right.

1:25:10.192 --> 1:25:12.019
You mentioned that.
Uh, you guys discuss

1:25:12.107 --> 1:25:13.325
that right now, alright?
I'm gonna go..

1:25:13.412 --> 1:25:15.284
You're not. Don't do this to me.

1:25:25.468 --> 1:25:26.512
What?

1:25:27.818 --> 1:25:29.124
Are you..

1:25:30.777 --> 1:25:32.127
What is that?

1:25:33.867 --> 1:25:35.391
Again, I want to say

1:25:35.478 --> 1:25:37.175
thank you to all of the locals

My mom would like
to discuss the game plan

1:25:42.920 --> 1:25:44.443
for selling the property.

1:25:44.530 --> 1:25:45.879
Things have changed, and..

1:25:45.966 --> 1:25:48.708
Uh, shh! I-I can't hear
the nice lady.

We're just waiting
on one more cast member.

1:25:51.276 --> 1:25:52.364
Hey, Huck?

1:25:57.021 --> 1:25:58.153

It's showtime.

- I got Jackson!
- Okay, we got Jackson.

1:26:33.275 --> 1:26:35.102
Okay, good. Let's do this, then.

1:26:35.190 --> 1:26:36.191
Trevor, are we really
shooting this?

1:26:36.278 --> 1:26:37.496
Yeah, I'm sorry, buddy.
We gotta.

1:26:37.583 --> 1:26:39.150

It may've been a lie, Billy..

1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:04.480
...but..

1:27:04.567 --> 1:27:06.438
Uh, but, uh..

1:27:08.048 --> 1:27:09.833
I am so sorry, I, I..

1:27:09.920 --> 1:27:11.094
Can I get the line?
Can we go back?

1:27:11.182 --> 1:27:12.749
I forgot, I forgot the line.

1:27:12.835 --> 1:27:14.794

Oh..

It may have been a lie,
Billy. but..

1:27:42.344 --> 1:27:43.996
Aah!

1:27:44.084 --> 1:27:45.041

1:27:49.133 --> 1:27:50.874
- That was close.
- Ooh!

1:27:50.960 --> 1:27:53.442
Don't touch him. He's fine.

1:27:53.529 --> 1:27:55.357
Your, uh, your-your tooth.

1:27:56.358 --> 1:27:57.359
Gone.

1:27:59.448 --> 1:28:00.710
Is it noticeable?

1:28:02.842 --> 1:28:04.931
- Let's go again.
- Go.. Uh..

1:28:05.018 --> 1:28:06.281
- He's missing a tooth.
- I don't care.

1:28:06.368 --> 1:28:09.022
We didn't establish teeth.
Get him up!

1:28:09.109 --> 1:28:10.894
Okay, let me go again.

1:28:10.981 --> 1:28:12.635
- Up you go.
- 'Up I go.'

1:28:12.722 --> 1:28:14.767
Yup. Oh, Kenny's alright.

Here we go, and rolling.

- This isn't going to work.

1:28:43.361 --> 1:28:44.406
It's going to work.

1:28:45.145 --> 1:28:46.321
Ugh..

1:28:46.930 --> 1:28:48.844
No.

[Bernie]
'Should we cut?'

1:28:50.237 --> 1:28:51.587
No, we're not going to cut.

1:28:51.674 --> 1:28:53.240
Give him the line again, please.

1:28:53.327 --> 1:28:55.286
- Really?
- Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1:28:55.373 --> 1:28:56.505
Okay. Uh..

1:28:58.637 --> 1:29:01.423
Everything you said was a lie.

1:29:01.510 --> 1:29:03.207
[Finley as Huck]
'It may have been
a lie, Billy..'

1:29:07.733 --> 1:29:09.300
It's all been a lie.

1:29:12.956 --> 1:29:15.306
[as Finley]
But I never meant to hurt you.

1:29:15.393 --> 1:29:16.742
What's going on with his voice?

1:29:19.005 --> 1:29:21.486
I should have told you

1:29:21.573 --> 1:29:22.791
at the lake.

1:29:24.315 --> 1:29:26.969
Lake? What lake? What lake?

1:29:27.057 --> 1:29:29.451
Right, we shoulda..

1:29:29.538 --> 1:29:32.454
We shoulda talked at the lake.

1:29:32.541 --> 1:29:34.064
But I was too afraid to.

1:29:35.500 --> 1:29:37.067
I was..

1:29:37.154 --> 1:29:38.764
...too scared of..

1:29:41.201 --> 1:29:42.550
...what might happen.

1:29:44.248 --> 1:29:45.597
Is he taking off his clothes?

1:29:46.990 --> 1:29:48.905
But I am sick

1:29:48.992 --> 1:29:51.081
and tired..

1:29:51.168 --> 1:29:52.778
...of being afraid.

1:29:55.868 --> 1:29:57.566
You know our friend, Huck..

1:29:59.045 --> 1:30:00.743
...he made me realize

1:30:00.830 --> 1:30:03.398
that I could either
stay invisible..

1:30:05.661 --> 1:30:07.314
...or I could be remarkable.

1:30:09.099 --> 1:30:11.406
So, if coming clean..

1:30:12.581 --> 1:30:14.234
...means losing everything..

1:30:20.371 --> 1:30:21.719
[gasps]

1:30:21.807 --> 1:30:23.940

in the cards.

1:30:25.637 --> 1:30:27.552
[chuckles]

1:30:27.639 --> 1:30:28.771
Who are you?

1:30:32.601 --> 1:30:33.776
That's a good question.

1:30:35.778 --> 1:30:38.041
Some people call me "Pig Girl."

1:30:39.956 --> 1:30:42.088
My daddy, though, he called me
"Princess."

1:30:45.483 --> 1:30:49.139
All I know is that
I have got one chance..

1:30:49.226 --> 1:30:51.663
...and even if I end up
with mud on my face

1:30:51.750 --> 1:30:53.360
I am going to take it.

1:30:56.625 --> 1:30:57.582

1:30:59.366 --> 1:31:01.499
I'm so sorry

You..

1:31:39.014 --> 1:31:40.320

Shut up, Kenny.

I'm gonna put you
in my next movie.

1:31:55.553 --> 1:31:56.772

1:32:10.568 --> 1:32:12.048

And the first thing to go..

1:32:16.791 --> 1:32:19.142
...will be that little pig.

1:32:19.228 --> 1:32:21.361
Straight to the slaughterhouse.

1:32:23.362 --> 1:32:25.148
I don't really think
that you would do that.

1:32:27.150 --> 1:32:29.413
Because I think
that there is a heart

in there somewhere, Valerian.

- Yes?

1:32:42.600 --> 1:32:45.081
We'll take the first offer
you get.

1:32:46.996 --> 1:32:50.041
Well, I'd have to get the
owner's approval to do that.

1:32:50.129 --> 1:32:51.348

and it turns out

1:32:55.221 --> 1:32:59.138
that Mr. Tremaine left
the property to his daughter.

1:32:59.225 --> 1:33:01.401

1:33:02.707 --> 1:33:04.187
His real daughter.

1:33:04.273 --> 1:33:05.884
So, you'd have to ask her.

1:33:11.585 --> 1:33:12.848
Is that true, Louise?

1:33:12.934 --> 1:33:13.892
It is.

1:33:15.807 --> 1:33:16.982
So, you're saying..

1:33:17.068 --> 1:33:18.723
You've got squat.

- 'Yeah?'

- Okay.
- Bad news is..

...you're gonna have to find a
new lead for your film.

Think that really is.

1:34:01.331 --> 1:34:03.376
Well, you know, it was written
for a male.

1:34:03.463 --> 1:34:05.552
- It-it's an action film.
- Right.

1:34:05.639 --> 1:34:07.903
But I'm thinking right now

1:34:07.990 --> 1:34:10.688
that it would be so much better
with a female.

1:34:10.775 --> 1:34:12.385
Finley.

1:34:12.472 --> 1:34:13.822
Geez.

- Okay.

1:34:22.091 --> 1:34:23.309
Hm..

1:34:23.396 --> 1:34:25.572
I could hang back

to look after Jon Ham.

a manager anymore

- No..

- I'm not picking up pig poop.
