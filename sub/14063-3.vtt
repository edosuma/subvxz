Pull the rabbit out of your hat.

00:04.423 --> 00:09.234
That's the secret of both
trial law and life.

00:09.234 --> 00:11.375
Rabbits… –Yeah.

00:11.375 --> 00:12.744
Christine Polley…

00:12.744 --> 00:14.178
Ex­girlfriend tried to kill me.

00:14.178 --> 00:15.497
She tried to kill you.

00:15.497 --> 00:17.087
–She did.
–And now she wants out.

00:17.087 --> 00:18.643
She does. –Alan.

00:18.643 --> 00:21.128
She's stalking you.
She tried to kill you,

00:21.128 --> 00:22.900
she was institutionalized,
now she's out,

00:22.900 --> 00:24.031
and she's stalking you.

00:24.031 --> 00:26.423
Freedom is a privilege, 
Mr Shore, not a right.

00:26.423 --> 00:28.497
–A privilege. 
–Yes, and it's revocable,

00:28.497 --> 00:31.688
especially if you try to run
someone over with an automobile.

00:31.688 --> 00:33.305
I got my old job back.

00:33.305 --> 00:37.243
It's truly fantastic news, 
isn't it? Alan?

00:37.243 --> 00:38.675
Yes.

00:39.351 --> 00:41.966
(http://club.nate.com/tsm)

00:49.663 --> 00:51.184
Why aren't you helping me?

00:51.184 --> 00:52.785
Sally, I have a trial of my own

00:52.785 --> 00:54.526
beginning tomorrow, a rather big one.

00:54.526 --> 00:57.055
But this is my very first trial.

00:57.055 --> 00:59.378
You've certainly been to
court before, I have no doubt.

00:59.378 --> 01:02.117
Motion practice.
This is with a jury.

01:02.117 --> 01:04.555
I don't, I don't think I'm ready.

Sally…

01:16.642 --> 01:18.358
look at me.

01:22.566 --> 01:24.429
You trust me?

01:24.429 --> 01:25.535
I do.

01:25.535 --> 01:29.467
And because you trust me, you'll 
believe what I'm about to tell you.

01:29.467 --> 01:30.972
I will.

01:30.972 --> 01:33.286
That's all it is.

01:34.644 --> 01:35.785
All what is?

01:35.785 --> 01:37.567
Trial law…

01:37.567 --> 01:39.532
getting the jury to trust you

01:39.532 --> 01:42.538
so they'll believe what you tell them.

01:42.733 --> 01:44.161
Really?

01:45.047 --> 01:47.264
Sincerity, Sally,

01:47.264 --> 01:52.230
once you learn to fake that,
there'll be no stopping you.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON ABC: 2004/10/17

02:44.066 --> 02:45.837
Denny, we've got…

02:46.984 --> 02:47.809
What's going on?

02:47.809 --> 02:49.381
A little maintenance work, Paul.

02:49.381 --> 02:51.707
Wouldn't hurt you, by the way.
You look like a prune.

02:51.707 --> 02:53.861
We have the Kaneb meeting
in 15 minutes.

02:53.861 --> 02:55.495
Excellent. Why do I care?

02:55.495 --> 02:58.126
You care because this is
the construction project

02:58.126 --> 03:01.193
that the entire firm has been
working on for 18 months.

03:01.193 --> 03:03.599
You care because Byron Kaneb cares,

03:03.599 --> 03:06.109
and he expects you to be present.

03:06.842 --> 03:08.347
Damn it, man, what have you done?

03:08.347 --> 03:10.466
The needle broke.

03:10.872 --> 03:12.259
Not to worry, just 
let me remove it.

03:12.259 --> 03:13.528
Don't you touch me.

03:13.528 --> 03:15.377
Mr Crane, half the needle
is still in your forehead.

03:15.377 --> 03:17.871
–Just let me remove..
–You're not touching me!

03:17.871 --> 03:19.706
Get Dr Michaels back down here.

03:19.706 --> 03:23.361
This is what happens when I let 
his kids cut their teeth on my head.

03:23.361 --> 03:25.846
If I could just remove
the needle… –Don't you touch me!

03:25.846 --> 03:28.406
Denny, there's a needle
in your head.

03:28.406 --> 03:30.010
Let him at least remove it.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.977
Get me Dr Michaels!

03:35.701 --> 03:37.868
I really don't need
a second chair for this.

03:37.868 --> 03:40.085
Sexual harassment is 
a specialty of mine.

03:40.085 --> 03:42.386
Mine, too. –No doubt, 
but while your experience

03:42.386 --> 03:44.490
tends to be more hands­on, mine…

03:44.490 --> 03:46.379
tends to be more wishful thinking.

03:46.379 --> 03:49.205
Not to mention, you ooze.

03:49.205 --> 03:50.736
I ooze?

03:50.736 --> 03:54.894
Yes, that certain something that 
subliminally champions misogyny.

03:54.894 --> 03:56.756
You need me.

03:59.042 --> 04:00.515
Lori,

04:01.176 --> 04:06.839
as much as I may want you,
desire you, even,

04:06.839 --> 04:09.275
I do not need you.

04:09.275 --> 04:11.221
See that right there?

04:11.221 --> 04:12.771
Ooze!

04:16.790 --> 04:18.663
When can I dig my hole?

04:18.663 --> 04:20.261
We're almost there, Byron.

04:20.261 --> 04:22.693
Don't tell me we're 
almost there, Paul.

04:22.693 --> 04:25.484
We've been almost there
for six months.

04:25.484 --> 04:27.020
When will we be there?

04:27.020 --> 04:30.260
City council agreed to the variance
for the golf course on Monday.

04:30.260 --> 04:31.417
Now today we're expecting an answer

04:31.417 --> 04:33.341
from the redevelopment commission
for the outdoor mall,

04:33.341 --> 04:35.250
and my sources say they're 
gonna rule in our favor.

04:35.250 --> 04:36.684
What about the damn E.P.A.?

04:36.684 --> 04:38.773
The blue spotted salamander 
just got downgraded

04:38.773 --> 04:41.072
from endangered to 
threatened last week,

04:41.072 --> 04:43.222
so the marina looks 
like a go except for…

04:43.222 --> 04:44.353
Except for what?

04:44.353 --> 04:48.567
It seems there's a river
where some salmon spawn.

04:48.567 --> 04:52.867
Evidently, there's some environmental
lawyer who's making a stink.

04:52.867 --> 04:55.326
When you say stink…

04:55.326 --> 04:58.350
He got a T.R.O.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.742
A fish?

05:00.742 --> 05:03.737
My city's being held up by a fish?

05:03.737 --> 05:05.376
We are meeting the lawyer today.

05:05.376 --> 05:08.038
We will make it go away.

05:15.420 --> 05:18.710
Do you plan to contribute, or are you
simply assigned to mop up the ooze?

05:18.710 --> 05:19.800
Alan.

05:24.153 --> 05:25.262
Hello.

05:25.606 --> 05:27.479
Christine Pauley.

05:27.792 --> 05:29.405
Oh, I've heard so much about you.

05:29.405 --> 05:30.522
How are you?

05:30.522 --> 05:32.584
Fine, thank you.

05:33.030 --> 05:35.514
If you'll excuse us,
we're due in court. –Yes, I know.

05:35.514 --> 05:38.268
I'm opposing counsel.

05:38.493 --> 05:40.220
I beg your pardon?

05:40.220 --> 05:41.213
What do you expect me to do?

05:41.213 --> 05:43.962
I expect you to disqualify her.
This is tantamount to stalking.

05:43.962 --> 05:46.860
She got herself assigned
to this case because I'm on it.

05:46.860 --> 05:48.523
Not to mention,
as an officer of the court,

05:48.523 --> 05:51.269
I question whether Ms Pauley even
has the capacity to try a case.

05:51.269 --> 05:53.712
She was released from
a mental facility last week.

05:53.712 --> 05:55.733
Certainly, counsel,
if you wanna conflict out…

05:55.733 --> 05:56.988
I can't conflict out.

05:56.988 --> 05:58.806
I'm the only one
who knows the case here.

05:58.806 --> 06:00.830
–Ms Colson was simply put on…
–Ms Pauley,

06:00.830 --> 06:02.170
what's going on?

06:02.170 --> 06:04.171
Of all the cases to start off with,

06:04.171 --> 06:06.429
you pick one against an ex­boyfriend
you tried to kill?

06:06.429 --> 06:08.344
Actually, your honor,
I didn't pick it.

06:08.344 --> 06:09.910
–My firm came to me.
–Please, Christine…

06:09.910 --> 06:12.195
because I used to date Mr Shore,

06:12.195 --> 06:13.685
they thought I could shed some light

06:13.685 --> 06:16.276
on some of his procedural 
eccentricities, which I did.

06:16.276 --> 06:17.900
Since I also happen to have extensive

06:17.900 --> 06:19.640
experience in sexual harassment law,

06:19.640 --> 06:23.269
the senior parers asked me if 
I would first chair, I agreed.

06:23.269 --> 06:25.272
–We start at 11 A.M.
–Your honor…

06:25.272 --> 06:28.813
Mr Shore, if you wanna
conflict out, do so.

06:28.813 --> 06:33.670
But I have no legal basis
to disqualify Ms Pauley.

06:37.389 --> 06:39.084
May I speak with you alone, Alan?

06:39.084 --> 06:40.358
No, you may not, Christine.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.185
And if you choose to be 
on this case,

06:42.185 --> 06:45.376
please conduct yourself
at arm's length and on the record.

06:45.376 --> 06:47.732
It's just coincidence to you
your first case out of the hospital.

06:47.732 --> 06:49.475
I consider it a preposterous 
coincidence,

06:49.475 --> 06:50.561
you have no business trying a case.

06:50.561 --> 06:52.814
–But truth be told, the partners think—
–I know you better than your partners.

06:52.814 --> 06:55.072
How sad, you can't
be happy for me. –I'm not happy.

06:55.072 --> 06:57.447
Clearly.

07:00.001 --> 07:03.432
Well, that seemed perfectly normal.

07:05.246 --> 07:06.941
The D.A. offered three months 
suspended.

07:06.941 --> 07:08.554
I think we should take it.

07:08.554 --> 07:09.956
Does it go on my record?

07:09.956 --> 07:11.666
–Well, yes.
–The answer's no.

07:11.666 --> 07:12.905
Ramone… –I didn't do it.

07:12.905 --> 07:13.679
I didn't take that wallet.

07:13.679 --> 07:16.046
And as a matter of principle,
I won't pretend that I took it.

07:16.046 --> 07:17.399
They have an eyewitness.

07:17.399 --> 07:21.323
Look here, I might seem like
some court­appointed charity case,

07:21.323 --> 07:23.689
but I'm an honest man.
I don't steal.

07:23.689 --> 07:27.000
And I won't agree to any plea
that says otherwise.

07:27.211 --> 07:28.535
Mr Seymore.

07:28.914 --> 07:30.181
Hi, Sally Heep.

07:30.181 --> 07:31.502
I'm in litigation at the firm.

07:31.502 --> 07:32.705
I know that.

07:32.705 --> 07:36.334
–You in court today, or…
–No, but you are.

07:36.334 --> 07:39.252
I'm here to observe
your work, Ms Heep.

07:39.252 --> 07:40.658
Good luck.

07:49.266 --> 07:50.377
Denny,

07:51.329 --> 07:55.108
the lawyer who got the T.R.O.

07:55.737 --> 07:58.508
On the Kaneb construction project…

07:58.508 --> 08:00.525
Ah. 
Pay him out, Paul.

08:00.525 --> 08:01.941
Give him a bottle of scotch
and some money

08:01.941 --> 08:04.745
to buy some more bus bench ads.

08:04.745 --> 08:07.149
He says he's your son.

08:21.470 --> 08:23.518
It's true.

08:23.518 --> 08:26.206
You're a lawyer now.

08:26.692 --> 08:28.453
Hey…

08:28.705 --> 08:30.578
Dad.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.424
You got a needle in your head.

08:40.424 --> 08:43.386
Small accident.
Not to worry.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.573
Son.

08:46.133 --> 08:47.975
Dad.

08:59.240 --> 09:02.663
You're a lawyer now.
That's how you greet people?

09:03.479 --> 09:04.905
Donny Crane.

09:09.208 --> 09:10.635
Denny Crane.

09:10.907 --> 09:12.383
Donny Crane.

09:12.383 --> 09:13.339
Denny Crane.

09:13.339 --> 09:14.890
Donny Crane.

09:14.890 --> 09:16.023
Denny Crane.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.272
Donny Crane.

09:17.272 --> 09:18.296
Denny Crane.

09:18.296 --> 09:19.447
Donny Crane.

09:19.447 --> 09:20.742
Denny Crane.

09:20.742 --> 09:22.313
Donny Crane.

09:28.326 --> 09:30.892
I had a one-night stand with his mother.

09:30.892 --> 09:33.891
I paid for his education and so forth.

09:33.891 --> 09:37.595
I did everything I could
to be a good father.

09:37.595 --> 09:39.374
When's the last time you saw him?

09:39.374 --> 09:40.911
Oh, I don't know.

09:40.911 --> 09:42.434
When he was 12?

09:42.927 --> 09:47.171
We've offered several
decent compromises. –And?

09:47.171 --> 09:49.730
He just keeps on saying his name.

09:49.730 --> 09:52.549
Oh, I'll talk to him.

09:56.177 --> 09:57.431
How's my boy?

09:57.431 --> 09:59.950
They don't really need
to bug you with this, dad.

09:59.950 --> 10:03.528
So, what's this all about,
saving some fish?

10:03.528 --> 10:06.574
Well, see, your lawyers…

10:06.574 --> 10:09.088
who are clearly very talented,

10:09.088 --> 10:11.336
persuaded a judge to 
eliminate the distinction

10:11.336 --> 10:13.964
between farmed salmon 
and wild salmon.

10:13.964 --> 10:16.302
The President of the United States

10:16.302 --> 10:18.657
proposed eliminating that distinction.

10:18.657 --> 10:21.827
Yes, I know. That's probably 
why the judge granted your motion.

10:21.827 --> 10:25.381
See, dad, wild salmon are 
an endangered species.

10:25.381 --> 10:26.854
The administration figures

10:26.854 --> 10:30.024
if you eliminate the distinction
between farmed and wild,

10:30.024 --> 10:31.498
and count them both as one,

10:31.498 --> 10:32.609
the numbers would go up,

10:32.609 --> 10:34.438
and you could take them
off the endangered list.

10:34.438 --> 10:35.648
And that way,

10:35.648 --> 10:39.230
they can lift the environmental
protections in place to protect them,

10:39.230 --> 10:43.521
which, of course, allows you
to build more shopping malls.

10:43.521 --> 10:45.829
Well, son, look at the big picture.

10:45.829 --> 10:50.024
If building this mall can save a
species from becoming endangered,

10:50.024 --> 10:54.691
let's, by all means, do it.

11:01.778 --> 11:05.513
I was vice president in charge
of alternative investments.

11:05.513 --> 11:07.784
And at the time of the affair, 
Mr Ralston…

11:07.784 --> 11:12.029
He was, and remains
president of the firm.

11:12.029 --> 11:14.454
This romantic affair lasted
how long, Ms Moore?

11:14.454 --> 11:17.823
About nine months, at which point,
I broke it off. –Because?

11:17.823 --> 11:20.010
Well, mainly because
I was a married woman.

11:20.010 --> 11:22.590
And I wanted to work things 
out with my husband.

11:22.590 --> 11:23.598
I see.

11:23.869 --> 11:26.327
And how did Mr Ralston 
handle the breakup?

11:26.327 --> 11:27.664
At first, I think, fine.

11:27.664 --> 11:30.177
But then he would continue
to try to get back together.

11:30.177 --> 11:33.280
He would schedule lunches,
meetings, ostensibly about business,

11:33.280 --> 11:35.611
only to pursue his romantic interests.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.546
He started calling me after hours.

11:37.546 --> 11:39.297
Sometimes he would send flowers.

11:39.297 --> 11:42.931
Eventually, it got so bad
I simply had to leave.

11:42.931 --> 11:44.446
You went to another
brokerage firm?

11:44.446 --> 11:46.653
At a lesser position for less money.

11:46.653 --> 11:49.586
There seemed to be a stigma 
about my departure.

11:49.586 --> 11:50.675
I don't know, I…

11:50.675 --> 11:54.875
maybe people thought that I had 
secretly been fired, I don't know.

11:54.875 --> 11:58.853
What I do know is I was
basically forced out of my job

11:58.853 --> 12:03.455
by his relentless unwelcome 
sexual advances.

12:03.455 --> 12:05.068
Thank you, Ms Moore.

12:14.993 --> 12:17.700
She looks demented.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.117
Ms Pauley.

12:27.678 --> 12:29.885
Leading up to your affair
with my client,

12:29.885 --> 12:32.270
he made welcomed 
sexual advances?

12:32.270 --> 12:35.471
Well, not at first.
I, I was a married woman.

12:35.471 --> 12:39.736
But at some point, the advances 
became welcomed.

12:39.736 --> 12:40.740
Yes.

12:40.740 --> 12:43.550
–A love affair then ensued?
–Yes.

12:43.550 --> 12:45.971
So I guess my client's strategy was

12:45.971 --> 12:48.863
“if at first you don't succeed,
try, try again”

12:48.863 --> 12:52.376
–a strategy you certainly ratified.
–Well…

12:52.376 --> 12:55.146
Since dogged perseverance
was rewarded the first time,

12:55.146 --> 12:58.459
I guess it would be only natural for 
him to adopt that strategy again.

12:58.459 --> 13:00.655
I may have sent mixed 
signals the first time,

13:00.655 --> 13:03.823
but I did no such thing this time.

13:04.659 --> 13:07.874
When you left, did you tell 
prospective employers the reason?

13:07.874 --> 13:09.534
No, I… –Why not?

13:09.534 --> 13:13.826
I suppose I feared that it wouldn't 
depict me in the best possible light.

13:13.826 --> 13:17.282
I was a married woman
having an affair. –Got it.

13:17.282 --> 13:19.518
So, this stigma you refer to,

13:19.518 --> 13:22.903
people wondering whether 
you were fired or not.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.848
That stigma was at least 
partly caused

13:24.848 --> 13:27.146
by your embarrassment 
over your own behavior,

13:27.146 --> 13:31.047
a married woman having an affair.

13:31.047 --> 13:35.280
–I suppose that's true.
–Thank you, Ms Moore.

13:50.305 --> 13:54.505
I was reaching into my purse to get
some change to feed the homeless.

13:54.505 --> 13:56.245
That's when I saw him coming.

13:56.245 --> 13:57.079
Who?

13:57.079 --> 13:58.216
Him.

13:58.216 --> 14:00.448
The guilty defendant sitting 
right there.

14:00.448 --> 14:01.251
Objection.

14:01.251 --> 14:05.572
Jury will disregard the reference
to the defendant's guilt.

14:05.572 --> 14:07.581
Then what happened?

14:07.772 --> 14:10.597
He reached into my purse,
grabbed my wallet,

14:10.597 --> 14:12.180
started rifling through it.

14:12.180 --> 14:13.095
What did you do?

14:13.095 --> 14:15.133
I stood there, frozen.

14:15.133 --> 14:16.653
I was shocked.

14:16.653 --> 14:19.557
He started running away
as he was rifling through it.

14:19.557 --> 14:22.792
Then he turns, 
and he's coming back.

14:22.792 --> 14:23.843
Then what happened?

14:23.843 --> 14:25.317
I ran.

14:25.317 --> 14:27.253
He started chasing me.

14:27.253 --> 14:29.096
Thank God he was 
tackled by some people.

14:29.096 --> 14:31.200
I don't know what 
he might have done.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.828
Ms White, are you absolutely sure
that it was the defendant?

14:34.828 --> 14:37.540
I can show you the pictures.

14:38.187 --> 14:39.651
What pictures?

14:39.651 --> 14:42.330
I have one of those little
phone camera thingies.

14:42.330 --> 14:44.431
I snapped his picture.

14:44.431 --> 14:46.035
And you have them?

14:46.035 --> 14:47.339
Look.

14:54.615 --> 14:57.179
You can see he's got the wallet.

15:20.716 --> 15:23.279
You just let the pictures 
be introduced

15:23.279 --> 15:25.311
without so much as an objection.

15:25.311 --> 15:26.668
Well, I thought, um,

15:26.668 --> 15:28.265
the prosecution didn't know 
about it either.

15:28.265 --> 15:31.660
So I couldn't claim unfair surprise.

15:31.660 --> 15:34.758
Could've gotten time to prepare 
a cross-examination,

15:34.758 --> 15:38.352
to research the photos 
for authenticity.

15:38.352 --> 15:41.464
Instead, you sat there quietly.

15:41.464 --> 15:44.645
There's eyewitness testimony
from the victim,

15:44.645 --> 15:48.485
a positive I.D. and pictures.

15:50.997 --> 15:54.382
How do you plan to proceed 
now, Sally?

15:54.382 --> 15:55.650
Um…

15:58.539 --> 16:01.834
my client wants to testify.

16:02.819 --> 16:04.657
And say what?

16:04.657 --> 16:06.029
Um…

16:07.094 --> 16:10.093
that he's innocent.

16:19.476 --> 16:21.407
It's a fish, for God's sakes.

16:21.407 --> 16:23.301
It's not just a fish.

16:23.301 --> 16:26.122
It's a salmon, which the government
is trying to wipe out.

16:26.122 --> 16:28.000
Now, look, I like to fish myself,

16:28.000 --> 16:29.627
catch and release,
the whole shebang.

16:29.627 --> 16:32.746
Pull them in by the lip, throw them
back out to prove you're humane.

16:32.746 --> 16:34.855
You're mocking me.
He's mocking me, dad.

16:34.855 --> 16:36.504
You're a Crane.
Get used to it.

16:36.504 --> 16:38.556
We will go to court.

16:38.556 --> 16:40.418
I love court.

16:40.676 --> 16:42.910
Donny Crane.

16:45.866 --> 16:48.494
Look, Donny, 
you seem like a nice kid.

16:48.494 --> 16:51.653
I have no doubt that 
you're a terrific attorney,

16:51.653 --> 16:54.154
but you are not him.

16:57.612 --> 17:01.256
You're like a son to him, aren't you?

17:01.513 --> 17:04.287
Does he hug you much?

17:04.733 --> 17:07.468
Look, if this is about some score
between you and the old man…

17:07.468 --> 17:09.073
It's not about any score.

17:09.073 --> 17:12.589
Hey, if you people want 
to go to court…

17:13.445 --> 17:16.040
Beat it, will you, Brad?

17:22.214 --> 17:24.549
Is it a score?

17:25.509 --> 17:28.223
Was I not there enough?

17:28.223 --> 17:30.270
Were you not there enough?

17:30.270 --> 17:36.128
Dad, I haven't seen you in 15 years.

17:36.128 --> 17:41.359
I may not have had the time 
to give that most dads had,

17:41.359 --> 17:45.559
but I thought I was giving you 
something much more important.

17:45.559 --> 17:47.370
Money.

17:48.466 --> 17:52.092
You gave me something even more
important than that, dad.

17:52.092 --> 17:54.657
You gave me the Crane legacy,

17:54.657 --> 17:58.671
and I fully plan on living up to it.

17:58.671 --> 18:00.543
So…

18:02.515 --> 18:07.659
I'll see you and your 
team in court.

18:08.459 --> 18:10.875
Donny Crane.

18:16.640 --> 18:20.676
At first, I saw it, but I didn't see it,
if that makes any sense.

18:20.676 --> 18:24.059
It took a few seconds to register.

18:25.055 --> 18:27.246
What took a few seconds?

18:27.246 --> 18:28.538
My wallet.

18:28.538 --> 18:33.150
I lost it two days earlier and 
then I see it right there in her bag.

18:33.150 --> 18:36.145
–Your wallet.
–Yeah, this funky orange color.

18:36.145 --> 18:39.770
It's not like there could be two 
of them, and I lost it on Washington,

18:39.770 --> 18:42.377
right where we were at,
so I figured she stole it.

18:42.377 --> 18:45.603
That woman stole my wallet.

18:45.603 --> 18:50.426
So… –So I walked right up and 
snatched it back. Self-help.

18:50.426 --> 18:53.371
You snatched back your 
own wallet. –Yes, I did.

18:53.371 --> 18:55.665
And I hustled off, 
because truth be told,

18:55.665 --> 18:59.321
the woman looked a little vicious.

19:00.895 --> 19:02.780
So what happened next?

19:02.780 --> 19:06.292
Well, I started to go through it
to make sure it was mine,

19:06.292 --> 19:09.436
and as I was going through 
the inside, I saw…

19:09.436 --> 19:11.832
Oh, my God, it's not my wallet.

19:11.832 --> 19:14.421
It looked exactly like mine,
but it wasn't.

19:14.421 --> 19:18.380
Truth is, I, I discovered later
I'd left it in my car.

19:18.380 --> 19:20.100
It was all a big mistake.

19:20.100 --> 19:24.774
So I started to run back to 
return it, and she just took off,

19:24.774 --> 19:27.738
and I started chasing, yelling, 
“lady, wait. I'm bringing it back,

19:27.738 --> 19:29.152
I'm bringing it back.”

19:29.152 --> 19:34.090
Then I got tackled,
and here I am.

19:36.883 --> 19:39.046
Your witness.

19:41.485 --> 19:45.101
So the wallet that you ripped
out of miss White's purse,

19:45.101 --> 19:47.406
the wallet that you just
ran off with,

19:47.406 --> 19:48.930
you thought it was your own.

19:48.930 --> 19:50.266
Yes, ma'am.

19:50.266 --> 19:52.323
Because it looked exactly 
like yours.

19:52.323 --> 19:54.078
Yes, ma'am.

19:55.212 --> 19:57.529
This one here.

20:08.821 --> 20:10.508
When we broke up, it was because

20:10.508 --> 20:14.543
she felt committed to working 
things out with her family.

20:14.543 --> 20:17.890
It wasn't that things were 
emotionally over between us.

20:17.890 --> 20:19.729
She said that. –Yes.

20:19.729 --> 20:22.776
And I suppose I felt,
you know, when…

20:22.776 --> 20:24.488
when two people love each other,

20:24.488 --> 20:27.328
you persevere through obstacles.

20:27.328 --> 20:30.332
My so-called sexual harassment,

20:30.332 --> 20:32.284
it wasn't about sexual advances.

20:32.284 --> 20:35.057
It was about getting her
to be true to her feelings.

20:35.057 --> 20:38.416
You were trying to show her that
she felt like having sex with you.

20:38.416 --> 20:39.897
Please don't trivialize this.

20:39.897 --> 20:42.815
I assure you, sir,
I take it very seriously.

20:42.815 --> 20:46.149
You say it's okay to harass
women in the workplace

20:46.149 --> 20:48.201
so long as you love them.

20:48.201 --> 20:51.016
I believed, and still believe,
she was in love with me.

20:51.016 --> 20:52.179
I see.

20:52.179 --> 20:54.847
And she lacked the autonomy to
make up her own mind. –Objection.

20:54.847 --> 20:56.661
She lacked 
the mental capacity, perhaps,

20:56.661 --> 20:58.763
–to be truly happy without you.
–Objection!

20:58.763 --> 21:04.546
Why is it some people just refuse
to accept that it's over. –Objection!

21:10.094 --> 21:12.656
I truly apologize.

21:12.656 --> 21:15.371
For a second, I thought you were
personalizing it, Alan,

21:15.371 --> 21:18.252
and I was out of line.

21:18.252 --> 21:19.903
I'm sorry.

21:20.755 --> 21:22.458
It's okay.

21:23.136 --> 21:24.745
You all right?

21:24.745 --> 21:26.042
Yes.

21:27.406 --> 21:29.122
It is ridiculous.

21:29.122 --> 21:34.983
The stress of a trial a week out of
the rubber room, going up against you.

21:34.983 --> 21:38.343
Why are you doing this?

21:39.622 --> 21:43.146
I was always safe
inside work, you know?

21:43.146 --> 21:45.444
It was a little cocoon.

21:45.444 --> 21:47.159
Can you continue?

21:47.159 --> 21:48.785
Oh, yes.

21:49.218 --> 21:51.600
It's just a little…

21:52.847 --> 21:57.473
again, I apologize for the outburst.

22:03.291 --> 22:06.876
Whatever you can do
to keep it personal…

22:06.876 --> 22:09.156
I'm sorry?

22:09.461 --> 22:11.699
She's kind of been
kicking our ass, Alan.

22:11.699 --> 22:15.746
That's the first crack
I've seen in her armor.

22:16.648 --> 22:18.714
I'm not going to exploit her.

22:18.714 --> 22:22.076
Alan, if you can't put your client's
interests ahead of Christine's,

22:22.076 --> 22:24.638
then step aside.

22:24.638 --> 22:27.593
Let number two take over.

22:28.155 --> 22:29.857
We now have to go to court?

22:29.857 --> 22:32.150
No, we are confident
we'll be able to handle this.

22:32.150 --> 22:34.214
I hire one of the biggest 
law firms in Boston,

22:34.214 --> 22:35.853
definitely one of the most expensive,

22:35.853 --> 22:38.361
and I'm being neutralized 
by salmon man,

22:38.361 --> 22:41.162
who happens to be your son?

22:41.162 --> 22:44.291
Let me tell you something, Byron.

22:48.164 --> 22:53.239
Um, Brad Chase is one of 
our finest litigators.

22:53.239 --> 22:56.825
He will handle this.

23:02.161 --> 23:05.523
Your honor, we've had meetings with
the environmental protection agency.

23:05.523 --> 23:07.006
They signed off on this already.

23:07.006 --> 23:08.082
With all due respect,

23:08.082 --> 23:11.533
the E.P.A. gets steamrolled
by the administration all the time.

23:11.533 --> 23:13.538
No matter what anyone 
proposes these days,

23:13.538 --> 23:15.200
there's always somebody somewhere

23:15.200 --> 23:17.197
who jumps up and screams,
“woe, the environment.”

23:17.197 --> 23:18.844
Now there's a word, your honor,

23:18.844 --> 23:21.620
a very simple word that describes 
what my client is trying to do here.

23:21.620 --> 23:25.201
Please don't let the word be
“progress.”

23:29.177 --> 23:30.792
How about “people”?

23:30.792 --> 23:32.978
People. –Yes.

23:33.181 --> 23:39.073
We are trying to invest 
in the future of people.

23:39.073 --> 23:41.192
Creating jobs in a time of unemployment.

23:41.192 --> 23:43.610
We're talking about over 1,000 jobs.

23:43.610 --> 23:45.570
We're talking about benefiting
people below the poverty line.

23:45.570 --> 23:48.335
We are talking about people 
hoping to educate their children,

23:48.335 --> 23:53.398
afford medical coverage, feed 
their families, basic human needs.

23:53.398 --> 23:59.097
This man wants to put all that on hold
because it inconveniences a fish.

23:59.097 --> 24:01.485
Mr Crane?

24:02.245 --> 24:05.072
Well, first,

24:05.072 --> 24:08.897
this whole thing kind of goes
to the farmed salmon issue.

24:08.897 --> 24:10.560
The government is trying
to count these

24:10.560 --> 24:12.470
genetically raised salmon 
as wild ones.

24:12.470 --> 24:15.404
So they can take salmon off 
the endangered species list.

24:15.404 --> 24:16.702
I get that.
So what?

24:16.702 --> 24:21.397
So what? –People judge, jobs,
insurance, schoolbooks, food. People.

24:21.397 --> 24:24.521
Well, farmed salmon is terrible for people.

24:24.521 --> 24:25.818
They're carcinogenic.

24:25.818 --> 24:27.947
They don't even look like real salmon.

24:27.947 --> 24:30.882
By the way, they're fed these 
little pellets to turn their meat red.

24:30.882 --> 24:36.446
–Otherwise, it's this pallid white.
–People, jobs, America first.

24:36.446 --> 24:38.044
There's a rumor.

24:38.044 --> 24:40.612
I can't give evidence on this,
but there's a rumor

24:40.612 --> 24:43.552
that cattle they have to kill
due to mad cow disease,

24:43.552 --> 24:47.094
they grind them up and then 
feed the meat to the farmed salmon.

24:47.094 --> 24:48.207
Objection, your honor.

24:48.207 --> 24:52.021
There is nothing in the record
that even remotely substantiates that.

24:52.021 --> 24:56.158
Counsel, the river in question
only concerns wild salmon,

24:56.158 --> 24:58.308
so can we get off the farmed salmon?

24:58.308 --> 25:01.528
We're talking about lifting the 
environmental protections on that river.

25:01.528 --> 25:03.438
They're inflating the salmon count

25:03.438 --> 25:06.643
with the farmed numbers to 
get those protections lifted.

25:06.643 --> 25:09.545
People, jobs, food chain.

25:09.545 --> 25:11.560
Oh, yes, people and jobs.

25:11.560 --> 25:15.679
Wild salmon is a billion-dollar 
industry in this country alone.

25:15.679 --> 25:18.148
Once we destroy the wild 
salmon population?

25:18.148 --> 25:19.790
and that's what we're doing.

25:19.790 --> 25:22.775
That's a billion-dollar industry gone.

25:22.775 --> 25:25.966
People, jobs, schoolbooks.

25:25.966 --> 25:27.835
And we'll have to go back 
to eating meat.

25:27.835 --> 25:30.337
People, cancer.

25:30.337 --> 25:32.395
We'll just eat the farmed stuff.

25:32.395 --> 25:34.494
There's nothing wrong with
synthetic food, your honor.

25:34.494 --> 25:39.197
We live in a synthetic country, 
for God's sake.

25:47.318 --> 25:49.348
And on that note…

25:49.348 --> 25:51.238
I'll rest.

25:52.074 --> 25:54.970
Donny Crane.

26:04.654 --> 26:06.987
You should have seen 
Seymore's face.

26:06.987 --> 26:09.476
–I think I'm about to get fired.
–You won't be fired.

26:09.476 --> 26:10.541
What am I gonna do?

26:10.541 --> 26:12.951
What can I possibly say
in my closing?

26:12.951 --> 26:15.166
I've got nothing.

26:16.156 --> 26:17.895
Rabbit?

26:19.049 --> 26:20.213
I'm sorry?

26:20.213 --> 26:23.775
Pull a rabbit out from 
under your dress.

26:23.775 --> 26:27.105
You know what Gerry Spence does
is these hopeless situations?

26:27.105 --> 26:29.663
He just tells the jury a story.

26:29.663 --> 26:32.433
A story? –Any story, as long 
as it's interesting.

26:32.433 --> 26:33.616
He just entertains the jury.

26:33.616 --> 26:35.301
He gets them right here,

26:35.301 --> 26:37.968
and in that moment when
he has them right here,

26:37.968 --> 26:39.754
he connects the story to his case,

26:39.754 --> 26:44.568
sometimes barely, 
sometimes ridiculously.

26:44.568 --> 26:46.707
And then he asks the jury
to let his client go,

26:46.707 --> 26:50.922
and for God knows what reason,
they often do.

26:50.922 --> 26:54.292
–A good story may be your rabbit.
–Alan.

26:56.113 --> 26:58.811
I'm sorry, Sally.
This is a little important.

26:58.811 --> 27:00.937
I need your number.

27:01.765 --> 27:05.211
You have my number, Christine.
I haven't changed it.

27:05.211 --> 27:10.029
Alan, every lawsuit eventually
comes down to a number.

27:10.029 --> 27:12.271
What's your number?

27:12.271 --> 27:14.873
$750,000.

27:14.873 --> 27:16.869
And I'm the insane one. $250,000.

27:16.869 --> 27:18.292
–Too low.
–It's more than fair.

27:18.292 --> 27:20.035
–She got other employment.
–At less pay.

27:20.035 --> 27:25.733
–The present-day value of $200,000.
–That offer is rejected, Christine.

27:28.465 --> 27:31.442
I don't know if I'm up to closing.

27:31.442 --> 27:34.213
I think I am, but I don't…

27:34.590 --> 27:39.326
The client will only go
up to $250,000.

27:44.526 --> 27:46.607
Please.

27:47.727 --> 27:52.407
That number won't get 
it done, Christine.

28:10.796 --> 28:14.488
A man with felony priors
for robbery and burglary,

28:14.488 --> 28:18.595
but this time, he stole
the wallet by mistake.

28:19.101 --> 28:20.413
Sure.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.192
One day, I was in my kitchen.

28:46.192 --> 28:49.088
I think I was about 15.

28:49.088 --> 28:51.033
And in came Fred,

28:51.033 --> 28:53.741
my big chocolate lab.

28:53.741 --> 28:59.430
And in his mouth was a dead rabbit.

28:59.430 --> 29:03.756
The neighbors' pet rabbit.

29:03.756 --> 29:06.777
And I thought, this is it for Fred.

29:06.777 --> 29:10.424
If they find out he killed
their adored pet,

29:10.424 --> 29:13.410
animal control would be down and…

29:13.920 --> 29:17.466
so I took the rabbit,

29:17.466 --> 29:19.844
washed him off in the sink,

29:19.844 --> 29:23.448
pulled out the blow-dryer,
got him all white and fluffy looking,

29:23.448 --> 29:25.271
and I snuck over to 
my neighbors' backyard,

29:25.271 --> 29:27.247
and I put him back in the cage,

29:27.247 --> 29:30.498
hoping they'd think
he died of natural causes.

29:30.498 --> 29:33.041
That night, my parents
came into my room.

29:33.041 --> 29:36.707
The neighbors' pet rabbit had died
three days ago, they told me.

29:36.707 --> 29:38.391
They buried him in the woods,

29:38.391 --> 29:41.765
and some wacko 
evidently dug him up,

29:41.765 --> 29:46.178
washed him off
and put him back in the cage.

29:46.178 --> 29:47.955
And I remember thinking to myself

29:47.955 --> 29:52.359
the truth is not only
stranger than fiction,

29:52.359 --> 29:55.256
but often less believable.

29:55.256 --> 29:57.826
And that's what we have here,
ladies and gentlemen.

29:57.826 --> 30:00.268
The logical version, I suppose,

30:00.268 --> 30:03.269
is that my client stole that wallet.

30:03.269 --> 30:06.510
The less believable,
but quite possibly true account,

30:06.510 --> 30:09.254
is that he mistook it for his own.

30:09.254 --> 30:11.076
Nobody, not one of us,

30:11.076 --> 30:13.158
can be sure it didn't happen

30:13.158 --> 30:18.537
exactly the way 
Ramone Valasquez said it did.

30:19.349 --> 30:22.981
That's reasonable doubt.

30:42.527 --> 30:46.148
People like to stare at 
their coffee a lot here.

30:46.148 --> 30:47.562
All set?

30:47.562 --> 30:49.303
Yep.

30:50.303 --> 30:53.342
You like being a lawyer, Alan?

30:54.568 --> 30:56.740
I do, actually. You?

30:56.740 --> 30:58.272
Yeah.

30:58.914 --> 31:01.558
Except for the days 
when the job is ugly,

31:01.558 --> 31:07.581
when you have to go against your 
instincts to be kind or compassionate.

31:08.494 --> 31:12.649
It's important that she not close well.

31:16.343 --> 31:18.940
Some people simply cannot let go.

31:18.940 --> 31:21.956
You love a person so desperately

31:21.956 --> 31:23.665
you, perhaps, lose sight of reason,

31:23.665 --> 31:25.571
and you begin to act unreasonably,

31:25.571 --> 31:27.551
perhaps out of control, even.

31:27.551 --> 31:31.191
It's possible Daniel Ralston
had no control over his behavior.

31:31.191 --> 31:34.791
Maybe he truly couldn't stop
pursuing Wendy Moore.

31:34.791 --> 31:39.747
Maybe he had to keep calling,
had to schedule those lunches,

31:39.747 --> 31:41.656
had to seemingly stalk her, 
if you will.

31:41.656 --> 31:44.085
He was in love with her.

31:44.702 --> 31:47.969
People in love lose their grip.

31:47.969 --> 31:51.952
But what's at issue here is her 
state of mind, her mental state.

31:51.952 --> 31:54.375
Not Mr Ralston's state of mind,

31:54.375 --> 31:56.274
but Wendy's.

31:56.274 --> 32:00.324
Was she reasonably upset
by this relentless pursuit?

32:00.324 --> 32:04.444
She's a married woman with a family
trying to salvage her marriage,

32:04.444 --> 32:08.244
and her boss keeps calling,
keeps coming, keeps coming,

32:08.244 --> 32:10.747
keeps propositioning her.

32:10.747 --> 32:12.306
The fact that she once loved this man

32:12.306 --> 32:14.734
only makes it worse, more difficult.

32:14.734 --> 32:19.168
What choice did she really 
have but to leave?

32:19.168 --> 32:21.180
Maybe that was his plan all the time.

32:21.180 --> 32:22.901
He knew he couldn't fire her.

32:22.901 --> 32:26.265
Maybe that was his 
psychological game,

32:26.265 --> 32:28.833
where the only thing that she could
really do in the end

32:28.833 --> 32:31.729
was get in her car…

32:32.197 --> 32:34.872
and drive off.

32:34.872 --> 32:38.824
He created a hostile 
working environment

32:38.824 --> 32:44.071
with repeated, unwelcomed sexual
advances, ladies and gentlemen.

32:44.071 --> 32:50.619
That is prima facie classic 
sexual harassment.

33:14.808 --> 33:19.038
Love happens in the workplace
all the time.

33:19.038 --> 33:25.342
In fact, it's where most affairs
start, most relationships.

33:25.342 --> 33:26.739
It happens.

33:26.739 --> 33:28.726
So do breakups.

33:28.726 --> 33:33.860
As a woman, I am offended
by the onslaught of these lawsuits.

33:33.860 --> 33:35.540
As neutral as the language may be,

33:35.540 --> 33:38.366
sexual harassment law
is gender biased

33:38.366 --> 33:40.697
it exists to protect women.

33:40.697 --> 33:44.416
It feeds into the perception
that women are weaker than.

33:44.416 --> 33:46.184
It goes all the way back
to common law,

33:46.184 --> 33:48.575
where women were denied the right
to enter into contracts

33:48.575 --> 33:51.760
because we lacked mental capacity.

33:51.760 --> 33:53.802
Today's harassment law
is designed to

33:53.802 --> 33:56.189
protect us from sexual banter
in the workplace

33:56.189 --> 33:59.809
because we just can't take it.

33:59.809 --> 34:01.498
I can take it.

34:01.498 --> 34:03.531
Can you? Can you?

34:03.531 --> 34:06.793
Do we really need to cleanse 
the workplace of all sexual expression

34:06.793 --> 34:08.928
so it'll be safe for us?

34:08.928 --> 34:10.438
These laws treat us

34:10.438 --> 34:13.321
as if we were either psychologically
or emotionally impaired,

34:13.321 --> 34:15.436
and I'm sick of it.

34:15.436 --> 34:17.370
Are some cases legitimate?

34:17.370 --> 34:19.351
Absolutely.

34:19.351 --> 34:22.300
But here, this woman is a grownup.

34:22.300 --> 34:26.315
She entered into an adult,
consensual relationship with her boss.

34:26.315 --> 34:28.982
It ended, perhaps bumpy.

34:28.982 --> 34:32.672
He's hurt, he's still in love,
so she sues.

34:32.672 --> 34:35.228
She wasn't fired.

34:35.228 --> 34:38.771
She's a college-educated
vice-president of a brokerage firm.

34:38.771 --> 34:41.649
She's 34 years old.
She's a professional.

34:41.649 --> 34:45.364
She's here today to tell you that
she can't stick up for herself.

34:45.364 --> 34:47.684
She is here today trying to
take advantageof a law

34:47.684 --> 34:50.228
that declares women to be 
the weaker sex.

34:50.228 --> 34:51.918
Not for me, ladies and gentlemen.

34:51.918 --> 34:54.806
I wouldn't have gotten 
in my car and driven off.

34:54.806 --> 34:57.894
I'd have sooner driven over him.

34:58.363 --> 35:00.690
Let's treat these people,

35:00.690 --> 35:02.763
both of them…

35:02.763 --> 35:06.009
as if they were grownups.

35:18.104 --> 35:21.177
My own quick research 
reveals wild salmon,

35:21.177 --> 35:23.333
especially Atlantic salmon,

35:23.333 --> 35:25.596
are threatened with extinction.

35:25.596 --> 35:27.491
They're an endangered species,

35:27.491 --> 35:32.042
which means the environmental protections
on that river have to stay in place.

35:32.042 --> 35:34.878
Your honor, they're not endangered
if you count the farmed salmon.

35:34.878 --> 35:37.330
I'm not counting the farmed salmon,

35:37.330 --> 35:39.568
and the idea to count them is absurd.

35:39.568 --> 35:41.493
That river stays protected.

35:41.493 --> 35:44.058
Your variance is officially pulled.

35:44.058 --> 35:49.132
A permanent restraining order
is now in effect.

35:50.397 --> 35:52.046
I keep telling you,
you talk too fast.

35:52.046 --> 35:53.254
You talk too damn fast.

35:53.254 --> 35:55.333
“America first. We're 
a synthetic country.”

35:55.333 --> 35:58.726
–What's wrong with you?
–The best man won in there.

36:02.195 --> 36:04.269
You know, dad…

36:04.269 --> 36:07.454
I've never really had
a big trial to speak of.

36:07.454 --> 36:09.073
This is…

36:10.294 --> 36:13.337
for the last 10 years or so,

36:13.337 --> 36:16.297
I've pretended to be you.

36:16.297 --> 36:18.450
Through college, law school, and…

36:18.450 --> 36:23.259
I always felt like whenever
I'd go into a courtroom,

36:23.259 --> 36:25.460
I would kind of…

36:25.460 --> 36:28.697
channel you or something.

36:28.697 --> 36:34.356
But this is the first time
I actually felt it.

36:35.766 --> 36:38.336
I was Donny Crane.

36:38.336 --> 36:39.915
Yes, you were.

36:40.518 --> 36:42.409
Yes, you were.

36:44.250 --> 36:46.591
In the matter of Moore vs Ralston,

36:46.591 --> 36:51.070
on the question of liability,
we find in favor of the plaintiff.

36:51.070 --> 36:57.999
We further order the defendant to pay
damages in the amount of $125,000.

36:57.999 --> 37:01.288
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
thank you for your time.

37:01.288 --> 37:03.136
You are discharged.

37:04.263 --> 37:05.412
I'm sorry.

37:05.412 --> 37:07.357
I got my verdict anyway.

37:07.357 --> 37:08.503
Thank you.

37:09.111 --> 37:10.899
Thank you.

37:12.338 --> 37:14.870
Congratulations, Christine.
You tried an excellent case.

37:14.870 --> 37:16.470
Thank you.

37:17.132 --> 37:18.543
Alan…

37:23.702 --> 37:27.528
I can and do accept that it's over.

37:27.528 --> 37:28.814
The thing is,

37:28.814 --> 37:32.780
while I was institutionalized,
the only person who wrote to me,

37:32.780 --> 37:36.217
who came to visit me,
who called me,

37:36.217 --> 37:38.137
was you.

37:38.137 --> 37:40.235
My world became 
quite 2-dimensional.

37:40.235 --> 37:43.072
There was the hospital and you,

37:43.072 --> 37:46.797
and when I was suddenly faced
with having to walk away

37:46.797 --> 37:53.474
from both the hospital and you, 
it was more than I could…

37:55.117 --> 37:58.542
but I am going to make it.

37:58.646 --> 38:00.902
I have no doubt.

38:02.149 --> 38:05.389
You tried an excellent case.

38:08.946 --> 38:12.755
We should eat at that wonderful
indian place sometime.

38:12.755 --> 38:14.865
I'd like that.

38:23.918 --> 38:27.142
You don't think she'll 
go Glenn Close on you?

38:27.142 --> 38:28.172
No.

38:28.172 --> 38:29.984
Out of compulsive curiosity,

38:29.984 --> 38:33.279
I always befriend my most 
colorful ex­girlfriends.

38:33.279 --> 38:35.613
Beautiful woman, Glenn Close.

38:35.613 --> 38:38.491
Always meant to have sex with her.

38:39.099 --> 38:42.212
Well, I went with the rabbit.

38:42.212 --> 38:43.574
Of what variety?

38:43.574 --> 38:46.641
I told an urban legend story
for my closing.

38:46.641 --> 38:48.673
Involved a rabbit.

38:48.673 --> 38:51.563
Got the jury right here. –And?

38:51.563 --> 38:53.796
They came back in 32 minutes.

38:53.796 --> 38:55.014
Not guilty.

38:55.014 --> 38:56.101
You're kidding.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.886
I thought we could celebrate…

38:57.886 --> 38:59.566
like rabbits.

38:59.566 --> 39:00.979
Your hutch or mine?

39:00.979 --> 39:03.606
9:00, my hutch. Be there.

39:03.886 --> 39:05.853
Sally Heep.

39:09.237 --> 39:14.101
Well, it seems we're all 
winners today in court, in love.

39:14.101 --> 39:17.045
You didn't win in court today.
Remember? Your side lost.

39:17.045 --> 39:19.524
Ooh, that's right.

39:22.041 --> 39:24.039
He was really something.

39:24.039 --> 39:26.272
You should have seen him.

39:26.977 --> 39:31.365
May I ask, how does a man not 
see his son in 15 years?

39:31.365 --> 39:34.571
Uh, don't start with me.

39:35.308 --> 39:39.253
I'm being curious, not judgmental.

39:41.149 --> 39:44.257
Is that who Denny Crane is?

39:47.727 --> 39:50.268
He's not my son.

39:52.335 --> 39:55.654
What do you mean, 
he's not your son?

39:55.654 --> 39:58.905
His mother slapped me
with a paternity suit.

39:58.905 --> 40:00.589
I settled.

40:00.589 --> 40:04.278
She came back about 10 years later
with a guilty conscience

40:04.278 --> 40:09.003
and admitted that I wasn't 
the father, just deep pockets.

40:09.003 --> 40:12.603
But I like the kid,

40:12.816 --> 40:16.616
so I kept paying for 
his education and so forth.

40:16.616 --> 40:19.093
Obviously, he doesn't know.

40:19.093 --> 40:20.982
His mother said…

40:20.982 --> 40:23.061
it would break his heart.

40:23.061 --> 40:28.562
He so liked being the son 
of Denny Crane.

40:28.562 --> 40:31.284
Who wouldn't?

40:31.959 --> 40:34.874
You're not my father?

40:41.108 --> 40:43.600
I'm not your son?

40:49.807 --> 40:52.639
I'm not your son.

40:55.531 --> 40:57.569
Not by blood.

40:58.090 --> 41:01.798
Then how?
You didn't raise me.

41:02.461 --> 41:05.068
Who's my father?

41:05.304 --> 41:09.548
You'll have to discuss that
with your mother.

41:16.095 --> 41:19.682
It's all been a lie. –Hey…

41:19.682 --> 41:23.802
What wasn't a lie was your 
performance in that courtroom.

41:23.802 --> 41:26.363
You're a hell of a lawyer.

41:27.795 --> 41:30.868
You did channel me.

41:35.244 --> 41:37.882
I, I got to go.

41:46.385 --> 41:47.620
Sir…

41:49.000 --> 41:52.432
is it okay if I keep the name?

41:53.235 --> 41:54.971
Of course.

42:00.817 --> 42:02.790
Donny Crane.
