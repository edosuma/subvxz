That's it.
I'm going in.

17:52.439 --> 17:53.771
Ew!

17:53.773 --> 17:55.840
Why are you grabbing<i> my</i> hand?

17:55.842 --> 17:57.442
I thought
you were my girlfriend.

17:57.444 --> 18:00.244
What are you talking about,
Trent? I'm your girlfriend.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.613
How do you not know
who your own girlfriend is?

18:02.615 --> 18:04.348
Hey!
Leave him alone!

18:04.350 --> 18:05.883
None of us knew
who we were dating.

18:05.885 --> 18:06.951
Eddie: What?!

18:06.953 --> 18:08.252
Why you gonna tell them that?

18:08.254 --> 18:11.122
Wait... you didn't know
we were dating?

18:11.124 --> 18:12.690
I mean, I did, but, you know,

18:12.692 --> 18:14.692
you pushed a lot of people
in the mosh pit,

18:14.694 --> 18:16.127
so I made
an evidence board and...

18:16.129 --> 18:17.762
I can't believe this.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.933
[ Singsong voice ]
Couple coming through!

18:25.972 --> 18:27.371
[ Voice breaking ]
Breaking news...

18:27.373 --> 18:30.641
Another tortoise has appeared
in the shrubbery,

18:30.643 --> 18:32.310
in an apparent effort

18:32.312 --> 18:34.579
to guide the first tortoise
to safety.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.613
[ Chuckling ]
Oh...

18:35.615 --> 18:37.648
Um, I'm glad
you said that, uh, mindy.

18:37.650 --> 18:38.950
Sorry to barge in like this,

18:38.952 --> 18:40.284
but they banned me
from the studio.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.120
Uh, Gus,
mey-mey...

18:42.122 --> 18:44.388
I just want to apologize
for yesterday.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.824
I wasn't myself,
and, uh, you know,

18:46.826 --> 18:49.460
myself is...
Is all I can be, really,

18:49.462 --> 18:52.230
and occasionally,
a smooth criminal.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.298
[ As Michael Jackson ]
Shamone! Eee-hee!

18:55.468 --> 18:57.668
[ Both laugh ]

18:57.670 --> 18:59.770
Look at that.
Hey, forget about the Jackson 5.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.239
We got the Jackson 6 right here.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.340
[ Laughing ] Oh!

19:03.243 --> 19:05.510
I can't believe
you get paid more than me.

Louis:<i> Ooh!</i>

19:07.480 --> 19:08.613
<i>Ah! Ah!</i>

19:08.615 --> 19:10.481
Michael Jackson?!

19:10.483 --> 19:12.850
I taught him that!

19:12.852 --> 19:14.152
<i>Ooh!</i>

[ Sighs ]

19:19.425 --> 19:22.426
Did you figure out
your "big-kids business"?

19:25.498 --> 19:27.298
What's wrong?

19:27.300 --> 19:29.467
I screwed things up with Alison.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.936
I really liked her,
and I don't know what to do.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.373
Have you tried talking to her?

19:35.375 --> 19:36.375
No.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.142
Why not?

19:38.144 --> 19:40.311
Well, 'cause I don't think

19:40.313 --> 19:42.213
that's how they do things
in seventh grade.

19:42.215 --> 19:43.881
How's that working for you?

19:47.320 --> 19:49.053
Alison.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.156
Hey, you got anything
to say to her,

19:52.158 --> 19:53.558
you can pass a note through<i> me.</i>

19:53.560 --> 19:54.759
It's okay, ned.

19:57.730 --> 19:58.963
I'm listening.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.333
To be honest, I didn't even know
we were dating,

20:02.335 --> 20:04.202
and when I found out we were,

20:04.204 --> 20:06.170
I didn't want to do anything
to mess it up,

20:06.172 --> 20:08.039
because I like you a lot.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.174
And I don't know if we're
supposed to be saying that

20:10.176 --> 20:12.476
in seventh grade
or if we're supposed to be

20:12.478 --> 20:14.645
having this conversation
on an escalator.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.747
I don't know how
any of this works.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.217
Yeah. It's weird.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.219
I had so much fun with you
at the fall ball,

20:21.221 --> 20:23.154
but then my friends were like,
"you can't talk to him.

20:23.156 --> 20:24.156
You're dating him."

20:24.157 --> 20:26.757
Well, I'm sorry we broke up.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.260
Broke up?
We didn't break up.
We didn't?

20:29.262 --> 20:31.596
No. That was our first fight,
and we got through it.

20:31.598 --> 20:32.930
We did?

20:32.932 --> 20:35.233
Yes. And now
we're stronger than ever.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.567
A'ight. A'ight.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.203
So, are all my friends
still dating your friends?

20:39.205 --> 20:40.404
Oh, hell no.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.940
In fact, they shouldn't
come around for a while...

20:42.942 --> 20:44.408
Especially Dave.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.910
A'ight. A'ight.

20:45.912 --> 20:46.944
That makes sense.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.179
Walk me to class?

20:48.181 --> 20:50.848
Okay, but just so I'm clear...

20:50.850 --> 20:51.916
You're my girlfriend?

20:51.918 --> 20:53.217
Yes.

20:53.219 --> 20:55.253
I'll explain on the way.
Come on.

21:02.395 --> 21:06.130
So, the number-one dating rule
is to listen to a woman.

21:06.132 --> 21:10.268
"Listen... To... Her."

21:10.270 --> 21:13.971
What if what she's saying
is, uh... Boring?

21:13.973 --> 21:15.973
You should still
be listening to her.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.075
Even if she's
talking about horses?

21:18.077 --> 21:20.144
<i>Especially</i> when
she's talking about horses.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.046
What if you're scared of horses?

21:22.048 --> 21:24.548
Don't be scared of horses!

Of horses."
