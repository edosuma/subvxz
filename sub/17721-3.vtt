WEBVTT

00:02.083 --> 00:03.583
Erica: (Giggling)

00:03.625 --> 00:05.000
Man: The best part was...
Erica: Uh-huh.

00:05.041 --> 00:06.917
Man: When she said,
"um, aren't those my pants"?

00:06.959 --> 00:08.875
Both: (Giggle)

00:08.917 --> 00:10.500
- You know what, Mike?

00:10.542 --> 00:12.959
I haven't had this much fun
in a really long time.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.083
(Cell phone ringing)
Gotta say.

00:17.041 --> 00:19.250
Oh, would you excuse me,
just for a second?
I have to take this.

00:19.291 --> 00:21.166
- Yeah, no worries.
- Thank you.

00:22.792 --> 00:26.375
- (Whispers) Ethan.
- This is a test of the
emergency broadcast system.

00:26.417 --> 00:28.458
- I don't think I need it.
I think it's going really well.

00:29.625 --> 00:31.083
- I hear a "but" coming.

00:31.125 --> 00:33.417
- No, no "buts".
I mean... he seems nice,

00:33.458 --> 00:35.458
and he's... he's cute
and... smart and funny.

00:38.083 --> 00:40.208
- But?

00:40.250 --> 00:43.041
- Where's the catch?
- Here's a thought.
Maybe there isn't one.

00:43.083 --> 00:45.125
Just leave it at that,
enjoy yourself.

00:45.166 --> 00:47.208
- I will. I am, totally.

00:47.250 --> 00:49.500
Only call if Godzilla attacks.

00:49.542 --> 00:50.834
(Cell phone beeps off)

00:52.375 --> 00:53.750
- So what should we do now?

00:55.208 --> 00:56.917
- Uh, well...

00:58.542 --> 01:00.041
It's getting pretty late.
Everything's closing.

01:01.625 --> 01:03.125
- Yeah.
- But, uh I do live right there.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.834
- Really?

01:08.333 --> 01:09.875
One drink?
- Yeah.

01:09.917 --> 01:11.291
- Okay.

01:14.709 --> 01:16.917
Okay, it's official,
I need to move in here.

01:18.542 --> 01:20.375
Not... Not...
I mean, into the building,

01:20.417 --> 01:23.166
not your actual apartment.
(Chuckles awkwardly)

01:23.208 --> 01:25.500
(To self) On our first date,
Erica. (Clears throat)

01:29.458 --> 01:30.834
Oh.

01:32.375 --> 01:33.792
- Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.

01:33.834 --> 01:35.792
I'm a secret slob
when it comes to dishes.

01:35.834 --> 01:38.166
- Oh, thank you.

01:40.417 --> 01:42.333
Oh, Mike, these are amazing.

01:42.375 --> 01:45.041
- I love African masks.

01:45.083 --> 01:47.667
Spent six months in Kenya
last year.

01:47.709 --> 01:49.834
That one there, that was carved
from a Mpingo tree.

01:52.291 --> 01:53.875
- May I?
- Sure.

01:56.625 --> 01:58.458
(Exhales in awe)

02:02.291 --> 02:04.291
- Wow.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.250
Mpingo... It's very Kenyan.

02:10.291 --> 02:11.875
(Gulping)

02:15.208 --> 02:17.000
- So, do you want another drink?

02:17.041 --> 02:18.875
- Yes, thank you. I sure do.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.500
The first date is like
an open house.

02:22.542 --> 02:25.208
The pictures look great,
the dimensions are good,

02:25.250 --> 02:27.583
and as you stand
on the threshold, you think,

02:27.625 --> 02:29.417
could this be it?
Could this be the one?

02:35.750 --> 02:37.500
Um, do you mind
if we just... okay.

02:40.291 --> 02:42.083
You open the door
full of anticipation,

02:43.542 --> 02:45.041
you walk in,

02:45.083 --> 02:47.291
and then you start to notice
the details:

02:47.333 --> 02:49.500
the cracks in the wall,
the weird little quirks.

02:49.542 --> 02:51.583
And then you think, no...

02:53.375 --> 02:54.875
this isn't for me.

02:56.333 --> 02:58.000
Um, Mike,

02:58.041 --> 02:59.542
you know, I think that
I should, uh...

02:59.583 --> 03:01.542
I should probably
just get going now, so...

03:03.959 --> 03:05.375
- Oh. I can drive you.

03:05.417 --> 03:06.834
- No, that's okay. Uh, the cab,

03:06.875 --> 03:08.208
I'm just gonna,
I'm gonna call a cab.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.500
But thank you.
Thanks for the night.

Erica: Bring it.
Ethan: (Grunts) African masks,
can't have that.

04:00.583 --> 04:02.875
- It was made in Taiwan.
He said he bought it in Africa.

04:02.917 --> 04:05.000
I mean, does he not check
the labels?

04:06.667 --> 04:08.333
- You know, you always do this.
You're like a bloodhound.

04:08.375 --> 04:10.333
- You sniff out the weirdest
things about these guys.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.542
- How do I even know
that he's been to Africa?

04:12.583 --> 04:14.917
Maybe the masks are like a prop
to get girls to think that
he's cultured.

04:16.458 --> 04:17.834
- Or maybe you're the weird one.

04:17.875 --> 04:19.500
- Oh, oh, and did I tell you

04:19.542 --> 04:21.250
about the Idiot's Guide
to Dostoevsky?

04:22.792 --> 04:24.125
- Yes! Advantage, Federer.

04:25.667 --> 04:26.959
You never read Doestoevsky.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.125
- I loved Anna Karenina.

04:29.166 --> 04:31.000
- Erica, that's Tolstoy.

04:31.041 --> 04:32.667
- All I'm saying is that
why can't I meet somebody

04:32.709 --> 04:34.875
who's not damaged or crazy or...

04:34.917 --> 04:36.583
or a fake African mask
collector.

04:36.625 --> 04:38.291
I mean, what is wrong with me?

04:39.792 --> 04:41.291
- You suck at Wii?

04:42.750 --> 04:44.750
- That's funny.

04:44.792 --> 04:47.208
No, you're great,
it's the process that sucks.

04:47.250 --> 04:48.917
Being single, dating,

04:48.959 --> 04:51.417
wanting something
you can't find or can't keep.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.667
It's endless.
- Mm-hmm.

04:53.709 --> 04:56.583
- Ooh...

04:56.625 --> 04:58.458
You want to find a patio
and get wasted?

04:58.500 --> 05:01.834
- Absolutely. But I can't.
I have to uh...

05:01.875 --> 05:03.792
go help Judith decorate
the high school gym,

05:03.834 --> 05:05.750
and I'm gonna be late.

05:05.792 --> 05:08.125
- Mm! Oh, the big reunion.
You psyched?

05:08.166 --> 05:10.041
- Not exactly.
- Why not?

05:10.083 --> 05:12.542
- Um, you know why.

05:12.583 --> 05:14.458
I mean, come on,
I'm-I'm single and unemployed.

05:16.041 --> 05:17.542
Not exactly a raging success.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.250
You know the thing about people
that peak in high school?

05:19.291 --> 05:21.375
That might be me.

05:21.417 --> 05:23.333
- No, it's not.

05:24.875 --> 05:26.417
- Okay, then I guess
I'm just a paranoid freak.

05:27.917 --> 05:29.792
Look, I'll call you later.

05:29.834 --> 05:31.250
Best of three.

05:31.291 --> 05:33.208
- All right. Have fun.

05:34.875 --> 05:36.875
Erica: So, Jessica Robertson
and Becky Blok emailed

05:36.917 --> 05:38.709
to say that they're gonna
make it.

05:38.750 --> 05:40.458
Judith: I never liked Jessica.

05:40.500 --> 05:41.750
Ever since she played Juliet
in grade twelve,

05:41.792 --> 05:43.333
that went straight to her head.

05:43.375 --> 05:45.250
- Wow, you hold a grudge.

05:45.291 --> 05:47.333
- (Laughs) You should talk.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.083
Okay. Don't be mad.
- What?

05:52.625 --> 05:54.041
- I forgot to tell you...

05:54.083 --> 05:56.625
Katie's coming in
from Vancouver for this.

05:56.667 --> 05:58.500
- You "forgot" to tell me?
Katie: Erica!

06:00.041 --> 06:01.417
- (Fake excited squeal)
- How are you?

06:02.959 --> 06:04.417
Oh. It is so great to see you.

06:04.458 --> 06:05.750
- Uh, how are things?

06:07.375 --> 06:09.417
- Just switched jobs.
Okay, it was a promotion.

06:09.458 --> 06:11.417
(Chuckles) I have my own column
at The Globe now.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.000
Vancouver office.

06:13.041 --> 06:15.375
- Oh, wow, congratulations.
That's great.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.208
- My bosses are billing me
as the new Leah Mclaren.

06:18.834 --> 06:21.000
I promised them something
about the reunion.

06:21.041 --> 06:22.834
You know, who was the least
likely to succeed, but did.

06:22.875 --> 06:24.583
Who was most likely to succeed

06:24.625 --> 06:27.458
but instead, peaked in high
school.

06:29.875 --> 06:31.500
How about you guys? Erica,
what're you doing these days?

06:31.542 --> 06:33.375
- Um, actually, I'm just
between jobs right now.

06:34.959 --> 06:36.667
- Re-evaluating, huh?
Good for you!

06:38.291 --> 06:39.834
You can get so caught up
in a career,

06:39.875 --> 06:41.583
the fast track...

06:41.625 --> 06:43.041
And how's Anthony doing?

06:43.083 --> 06:44.917
- He's great.
- Awesome.

06:44.959 --> 06:47.834
He is such a nice guy.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.166
But sometimes even
with the nice ones,

06:49.208 --> 06:50.792
you just want to smack 'em.

06:50.834 --> 06:53.500
Both: (Polite laughter)
- I remember before
I married Brian,

06:53.542 --> 06:55.417
all that time,
all those options.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.291
Tomorrow night
is the perfect night

06:58.333 --> 06:59.875
for you to be single, Erica.

06:59.917 --> 07:01.917
You are gonna have your pick
of all your old flames -

07:01.959 --> 07:03.959
the ones that aren't gay
or married yet.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.917
- Actually, Katie,
I am seeing someone

07:05.959 --> 07:07.792
and uh... he's amazing.

07:07.834 --> 07:09.750
We're actually,
we're quite serious.

07:11.625 --> 07:13.750
- Really? Well, I can't wait
to meet him tomorrow night.

07:16.625 --> 07:18.750
Do you know who will be there?
Zach Creed.

07:18.792 --> 07:20.583
He's the reunion photographer.
Ironic, huh?

07:22.125 --> 07:23.875
- I forgot to tell you that,
too.

07:26.333 --> 07:28.208
- What do you care?
You got your guy.

07:28.250 --> 07:29.667
It's all water under the bridge.

07:29.709 --> 07:31.333
- Mm, yeah. Ha.

07:31.375 --> 07:33.417
Anyway, I should go
get my ticket.

07:33.458 --> 07:35.917
I'll see you ladies
tomorrow night.

07:35.959 --> 07:37.875
- Heh.
- Ciao, ciao! (Titters)

07:41.750 --> 07:44.542
- What the hell are you doing?
- (Sighs) I don't know.

07:44.583 --> 07:46.834
Ethan: Why would you tell Katie
you have a boyfriend?

07:46.875 --> 07:48.750
- I don't know!
I can't stand that woman!

07:48.792 --> 07:51.417
She just, she automatically
assumed that I was single

07:51.458 --> 07:54.375
and that was it. It was like
the last straw and...

07:54.417 --> 07:56.333
So now I have to bring
this imaginary boyfriend
to the reunion

07:56.375 --> 07:57.792
and I'm so screwed.

07:57.834 --> 07:59.458
- (Laughing) You are just like--

07:59.500 --> 08:02.291
- Yeah, a moron. Thank you.
Thank you for that.

08:02.333 --> 08:04.417
So, will you do it?
- What?!

08:04.458 --> 08:05.917
- Please Ethan, be my boyfriend.

08:05.959 --> 08:08.375
You can do it.
I mean, you're smart

08:08.417 --> 08:10.792
and you're charming,
and you're funny and...

08:10.834 --> 08:12.792
- And I could use a night off
from thinking about my divorce.

08:12.834 --> 08:14.625
- Yes!

08:14.667 --> 08:16.041
- I'll be Sven,
the Swedish diplomat.

08:16.083 --> 08:18.500
- No.
- Jorge, the museum curator?

08:18.542 --> 08:21.417
- No, listen. Katie will
recognize you From U of T.

08:21.458 --> 08:24.250
You just gotta be you,
the best you that you can be.

08:24.291 --> 08:26.750
- What, soon-to-be divorced
elementary school teacher
not good enough for you?

08:26.792 --> 08:28.625
- No. You know what I'm saying.

08:30.166 --> 08:31.792
Oh, okay, this is my interview.

08:31.834 --> 08:34.333
Can you do me a favor?
Can you call Jenny and Judith

08:34.375 --> 08:35.834
and make sure they know
the plan?

08:35.875 --> 08:37.500
And make sure Jenny knows
to keep her mouth shut.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.500
- Got it. (Light kiss)
Good luck.

08:41.542 --> 08:42.875
- Thank you.

08:44.875 --> 08:46.667
Ambrose: Name some of your
favorite books.

08:46.709 --> 08:48.667
Erica: Favorite books? Wow.

08:48.709 --> 08:50.625
"1984."

08:50.667 --> 08:53.625
"A Handmaid's Tale."
"Of Human Bondage."

08:53.667 --> 08:55.000
"Franny and Zooey."

08:55.041 --> 08:57.291
- Uh, all fiction.

08:57.333 --> 08:59.000
- Yeah, I'm a fiction lover.

08:59.041 --> 09:00.959
- Applying for a job
in a non-fiction department.

09:02.583 --> 09:03.959
- (Awkward laugh)

09:07.792 --> 09:09.917
- So... tell me about
what you want to do.

09:12.667 --> 09:14.166
- Well, to be honest, I'm...

09:14.208 --> 09:16.875
I'm fascinated by the process
of taking an idea

09:16.917 --> 09:19.125
and shaping it into
a manuscript.

09:19.166 --> 09:21.458
I, I don't have a lot
of publishing experience,

09:21.500 --> 09:23.959
but I am a critical thinker and
I'm really motivated to learn.

09:25.667 --> 09:27.709
- You're far better spoken
than the 21-year-old grads

09:27.750 --> 09:29.792
I normally interview
for this job.

09:29.834 --> 09:31.792
But, I'll be honest,

09:31.834 --> 09:34.959
I've never considered
hiring someone as...

09:35.000 --> 09:38.625
well, mature as yourself
for a position like this.

09:38.667 --> 09:41.542
I just want to make sure that
you realize that this job is--

09:41.583 --> 09:44.125
- A hundred percent clerical?
Sorry to cut you off.

09:44.166 --> 09:47.041
- (Laughing) That's okay.
Yes, it's, uh...

09:47.083 --> 09:49.709
An assistant job. Entry level.

09:49.750 --> 09:52.208
- Absolutely. And I would be
expecting to make coffee

09:52.250 --> 09:54.917
and photocopy and collate
until my fingers grow calluses,

09:54.959 --> 09:56.959
and just... um...
- (Chuckling)

09:58.583 --> 10:00.458
Well, thank you for coming in.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.917
I'll make my decision
in the next few days.

10:03.959 --> 10:06.000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

10:06.041 --> 10:08.000
- Lovely to meet you.
- Yes.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.041
Erica: Do I have anything
in my teeth?

10:11.083 --> 10:12.542
- Big chunk of spinach.

10:12.583 --> 10:14.000
- Shut- (laughing)
- (Laughing)

10:14.041 --> 10:15.375
- Okay. We're holding hands,
we're walking in.

10:16.875 --> 10:18.333
Oh, crap. Wait.
- What?

10:18.375 --> 10:19.583
- 'Kay, there's Katie.
She's right there.

10:22.041 --> 10:23.709
- Cue the devastating charm.

10:23.750 --> 10:26.625
- No! 'Kay, we need an exit
strategy

10:26.667 --> 10:28.083
in case things
start to go wrong.

10:28.125 --> 10:29.750
Speaking of which,
did you tell Jenny and Judith?

10:29.792 --> 10:31.583
- Check. They have been
informed.
- Okay.

10:33.875 --> 10:35.709
- Let's do it, all right.
- Let's go.
- All right.

Erica: Okay, this is the plan:
we approach her, introductions,

10:46.792 --> 10:48.959
get this over with
so we can relax.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.458
Hey, you see me flip
my hair like this,

10:51.500 --> 10:53.083
that means abort the mission.

10:54.959 --> 10:56.917
- Smile! (Camera clicks)
Hey, Erica!

10:56.959 --> 10:58.875
Long time no see.

10:58.917 --> 11:02.000
- Hi, Zach. This is Ethan.
- Hey, man, Zach Creed.

11:02.041 --> 11:04.125
Oh, you two mind posing
for a few?

11:04.166 --> 11:06.208
I'm getting shots for
the "then and now" photo tree.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.583
- No thanks.
- Sure.

11:08.625 --> 11:10.291
Come on, it'll be fun.

11:10.333 --> 11:12.959
Come on, Erica,
let's see that smile.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.083
I know you know how to "move."

11:15.125 --> 11:16.917
Come on, let's see that smile,
Erica.

11:16.959 --> 11:18.500
(Camera clicks)

11:18.542 --> 11:21.000
- Ethan! Ethan, don't.
- That's it, Erica!

11:21.041 --> 11:22.667
Smile for the camera.
(Creepy chuckle)

11:24.166 --> 11:25.458
(Camera shutter clicks)

11:30.041 --> 11:32.125
- Can you just put me down
for a second?
- What's the matter?

11:32.166 --> 11:33.709
Nothing. Um, I just,

11:33.750 --> 11:35.875
I have to go use the restroom
for a second.

11:35.917 --> 11:38.166
- Okay.
- I'll be back.

12:07.208 --> 12:09.709
(Heavy exhale)

12:09.750 --> 12:11.917
- You look like you just
knocked over the Bunsen burner.

12:14.542 --> 12:16.959
- Alex Berlin?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.709
Oh my God.

12:18.750 --> 12:21.000
You look so different.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.750
- No goggles. No lab coat.

12:24.250 --> 12:25.709
You look the same.

12:25.750 --> 12:27.625
Minus the ponytail, you know.
- Yes.

12:27.667 --> 12:30.166
I remember the scrunchies.
Huge collection.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.208
- (Chuckles) Wow.
This is really weird.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.333
I think that you just said
more to me in the last minute,

12:34.375 --> 12:36.709
than you did the entire year
we were lab partners.

12:36.750 --> 12:38.583
- That's probably true.
I was horribly shy.

12:40.250 --> 12:41.959
- Well, clearly not anymore.
(Speechless stammer)

12:43.500 --> 12:45.083
- Yeah.
- Wow. (Chuckles)

12:47.834 --> 12:49.166
Ah...

12:50.834 --> 12:52.542
- Well, it was great
seeing you again, Erica.

12:54.041 --> 12:55.500
- You too, really.

12:57.166 --> 12:59.000
- You look great.
- You too.

12:59.041 --> 13:00.875
- Thank you.

13:00.917 --> 13:03.542
- See you inside?
- Mm-hmm!

13:03.583 --> 13:06.083
I'll see you in there.

13:06.125 --> 13:07.959
(Muted beat of dance music)

13:09.500 --> 13:11.875
- Ethan, where do you live now?

13:11.917 --> 13:13.959
- You know, I-I-I'm...
I'm still working that out.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.083
Katie: Erica!

13:16.125 --> 13:17.792
So, Ethan is the mystery man.

13:19.333 --> 13:21.750
Old friends in love. So sweet!

13:21.792 --> 13:24.250
- Yeah, well, it took us a while
to finally come to our senses.

13:24.291 --> 13:26.083
- Hey, if you're looking for
a little action on the side,

13:26.125 --> 13:28.041
I'm available.
- Jenny!

13:28.083 --> 13:29.959
- Sorry, I can't help myself.
Your man looks smokin' hot.

13:31.792 --> 13:34.208
- So tell me,
what do you do now?

13:34.250 --> 13:37.000
- Actually, I'm... I'm a doctor.

13:37.041 --> 13:39.250
- A doctor! Really?
That, that's so interesting

13:39.291 --> 13:42.041
because I did a piece on
the medical profession
earlier this year.

13:42.083 --> 13:43.834
Let me, let me just
steal him away.

13:43.875 --> 13:46.250
So what is your specialty?

13:46.291 --> 13:48.083
(Low hum of chatter,
dance music plays)

13:52.917 --> 13:55.000
(DJ scratches record
transitioning to a new track)

13:56.083 --> 13:58.583
(Hum of party chatter)

13:59.250 --> 14:01.625
- The thing you have to realize
is... everybody lies.

14:01.667 --> 14:03.000
Patients, they all lie.

14:03.041 --> 14:04.583
I used to be naive,
but it finally hit me

14:04.625 --> 14:07.000
when I was treating this nun
who came in covered with boils.

14:07.041 --> 14:08.542
- Oh my God!

14:08.583 --> 14:10.000
- Yeah, she thought
it was a stigmata,

14:10.041 --> 14:11.417
but I worked out that
she was actually having

14:11.458 --> 14:13.542
an allergic reaction to copper.

14:15.875 --> 14:18.125
- Wasn't that an episode
of "House"?

14:18.166 --> 14:19.834
- Ah... funny that you
should say that.

14:19.875 --> 14:22.333
It was. It was actually
based on my case.

14:22.375 --> 14:24.250
I do some pretty
high-profile work,

14:24.291 --> 14:26.291
so I'm always being
harassed by producers
for new material.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.000
- Uh, what're you doing?

14:32.125 --> 14:34.625
- Uh, nothing. I just, um...
I need to freshen up.

14:40.250 --> 14:41.709
(Door whooshes open)

14:43.917 --> 14:45.750
- Great. Perfect.
A therapy session.

14:47.792 --> 14:50.041
That's... exactly
what I need right now.

14:50.083 --> 14:51.917
- "Sarcasm: the last refuge
of modest people

14:54.625 --> 14:58.083
when the privacy of their soul
is intrusively invaded."

14:58.125 --> 15:00.000
Fyodor Dostoevsky.

15:01.917 --> 15:03.917
- Very funny.

15:03.959 --> 15:06.083
- (Chuckles) So?
That's a lovely reunion.

15:07.959 --> 15:10.291
Old friends, old flames...

15:10.333 --> 15:12.291
fake boyfriend.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.125
- I know. I shouldn't have
said anything to Katie,

15:14.166 --> 15:16.166
but we have a history and...

15:16.208 --> 15:18.333
Being around her,
it puts me on edge.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.250
So, I said what I said
and showed up here tonight

15:20.291 --> 15:22.166
and I'm already nervous
about how it's gonna go

15:22.208 --> 15:23.709
and who do I run into but--

15:23.750 --> 15:25.000
- Zach.
- You know.

15:26.875 --> 15:28.917
- It's on your list.

15:28.959 --> 15:31.083
"Losing my virginity
to Zach Creed."

15:33.125 --> 15:35.250
So why is this a regret?

15:37.125 --> 15:39.333
- (Sighs) Can I get a pass?

15:39.375 --> 15:40.834
I really don't wanna talk
about this.

15:40.875 --> 15:42.792
- You wrote it down.

15:42.834 --> 15:45.125
I mean, this is therapy.
It's not a spa,

15:45.166 --> 15:47.000
it's not supposed to be
comfortable.

15:48.917 --> 15:50.500
- It was the summer of '94,

15:50.542 --> 15:52.417
right before we all took off
for university,

15:52.458 --> 15:54.834
and my entire graduating class
went up to Muskoka

15:54.875 --> 15:57.291
for the very last time.

15:57.333 --> 15:59.125
I'd just started going out
with Zach Creed.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.041
He was the hottest guy
in our class

16:02.083 --> 16:05.333
and I'd wanted him for years.

16:05.375 --> 16:07.208
I knew I was starting
university

16:07.250 --> 16:09.291
and he was heading out west,
so it was my last chance and...

16:13.500 --> 16:15.208
I was young and stupid,

16:15.250 --> 16:17.417
and when he said
he had it all planned,
I just went along with it.

16:22.041 --> 16:24.834
The sex was horrible,
but the worst part came after.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.166
I guess Zach thought it'd be
cool to keep a souvenir

16:29.208 --> 16:30.959
of our time together.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.250
He couldn't resist showing
all of his friends.

16:34.291 --> 16:36.125
It took me months
to get over it.

16:37.875 --> 16:39.875
It wasn't even the humiliation
of other people seeing me,

16:39.917 --> 16:42.417
it was more...
me questioning my own judgment,

16:42.458 --> 16:44.542
and ever since then
I've just been so picky.

16:45.834 --> 16:47.125
- Is that a bad thing?

16:47.166 --> 16:48.625
- As far as relationships go,
it's debilitating.

16:49.208 --> 16:51.834
As soon as I meet someone,
I start looking for faults.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
- So this all started
with the "Zach" incident.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.166
You said that, uh...

16:59.208 --> 17:01.458
it took you a few months
to get over it.

17:03.458 --> 17:05.625
Sounds like you're maybe
not over it at all.

17:05.667 --> 17:07.750
I just saw him tonight
and I wanted to say something,

17:07.792 --> 17:10.291
but I... I couldn't.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.083
- So, tell me,

17:12.125 --> 17:15.083
this time, when you go back,

17:15.125 --> 17:16.750
what will you do differently?

17:18.333 --> 17:20.041
- Well, I won't have sex
with him, obviously.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.375
I would love to tell him off.

17:24.417 --> 17:26.458
And I can't deny that a part of
me wants the satisfaction of...

17:27.750 --> 17:29.250
- Revenge?

17:29.291 --> 17:31.291
- I don't know.
(Frustrated exhale)

17:31.333 --> 17:33.458
I mean, it's a regret.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.458
It's a bad experience that
I would be glad to erase.

17:38.041 --> 17:41.000
That's it.
- That's all.

17:45.125 --> 17:47.500
Girls: ♪ I can save you

17:49.041 --> 17:51.083

- I'm really sorry, you guys.

18:17.375 --> 18:20.083
I was just, uh...
momentarily distracted.

18:20.125 --> 18:22.417
- By what?
- Zach?

18:22.458 --> 18:25.250
- Uh, actually no.

18:28.125 --> 18:29.667

18:29.709 --> 18:31.333

- Come on!

18:44.125 --> 18:45.959
Two hours ago
you were going on and on

18:46.000 --> 18:47.959
about how perfect
it was gonna be.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.625
You were gonna lose it
under the stars,

18:49.667 --> 18:51.500
lying on the sand.

18:51.542 --> 18:53.959
- Yeah, well, you know...
I changed my mind, so.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.458
- You're joking.

18:57.166 --> 18:58.917
- Not even a little bit.

(Car horn beeps nearby)
Girls: Woooo!

19:02.625 --> 19:05.625
(Car rumbles,
loud rock music blasts)

19:05.667 --> 19:07.583
- Word.
- Hey.

19:09.417 --> 19:12.041
- I got the stuff.
- Yeah, about that...

19:12.083 --> 19:13.542
a little Southern Comfort,

19:13.583 --> 19:15.333
a little Limp Bizkit
on my CD player -

19:15.375 --> 19:16.709
so we can share earphones -

19:16.750 --> 19:19.250
and... a box of condoms.

19:19.291 --> 19:20.542
- Wow. That's really optimistic
of you.

19:20.583 --> 19:22.166
Listen, I... um...

19:23.625 --> 19:24.959
I... I mean...

19:26.458 --> 19:28.542
Yeah, that sounds good.

19:28.583 --> 19:30.375
That sounds wicked!
- Awesome.

19:30.417 --> 19:32.000
So I'll come get you later?

19:32.041 --> 19:34.041
- Yeah, I can't wait.
- All right.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.917
(Spits out hair)

19:37.959 --> 19:40.166
Okay.
- (Fake laughs)

19:43.083 --> 19:44.750
- You have to admit,
it was a bit weird,

19:44.792 --> 19:47.166
you suddenly changing your mind
for no reason.

19:47.208 --> 19:49.333
- No, I have a reason. It just,
it doesn't feel right, so...

19:52.041 --> 19:54.000
Honestly? I kind of feel like
my story about Todd
freaked you out.

19:54.041 --> 19:55.834
- Um... your story about Todd?

19:55.875 --> 19:59.417
- Yeah, I may have exaggerated
the details just a bit.

19:59.458 --> 20:01.542
- Like I didn't actually
bleed for three weeks,

20:01.583 --> 20:03.458
and, you know, it wasn't like,
it wasn't like that big,

20:03.500 --> 20:05.250
it was more like, like that big.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.125
You know, the weirdest thing
too, his balls were just, so--

20:07.166 --> 20:08.625
Oh, you know what? Really, Jude,

20:08.667 --> 20:10.500
I promise it has nothing
to do with your story.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.166
Totally promise.
You know, it's just,

20:12.208 --> 20:14.542
it's like a decision
that I came to on my own, so...

20:14.583 --> 20:16.583
- Oh. Okay.
- Yeah.

20:16.625 --> 20:18.709
- Ouch!
- Sorry!
- Alex? What the hell?

20:18.750 --> 20:21.083
Are you eavesdropping
on our conversation?

20:21.125 --> 20:22.583
- No, I, uh...

20:22.625 --> 20:24.125
Um...

20:24.166 --> 20:25.667
Uh...

20:25.709 --> 20:27.458
(Landing thud) Uh...

20:29.291 --> 20:31.250
I was just, uh...
- Hey there!

20:32.917 --> 20:34.500
Guys, bonfire's starting in ten
and we need more kindling.

20:36.625 --> 20:38.542
Judith and Jenny: (Giggle)

20:38.583 --> 20:40.625
- Um, I'll-- Yeah, I'll
catch up with you in a sec.

20:44.709 --> 20:47.375
Alex Berlin.

20:47.417 --> 20:49.417
How come you and I never talk?

20:51.291 --> 20:52.917
What were you doing up there
anyway?

20:54.583 --> 20:56.083
- I was writing.

20:58.750 --> 21:00.625
I write poems.

21:02.083 --> 21:04.208
- Oh.

21:04.250 --> 21:06.375
I promise I won't laugh.

21:06.417 --> 21:08.333
- I can't.
- Just one. Please?

21:10.291 --> 21:12.000
- Why are you even talking
to me right now?

21:13.625 --> 21:15.250
- Because I'm curious about you.

21:18.583 --> 21:19.917
Please?

21:22.458 --> 21:24.792
- (Clears throat)

21:24.834 --> 21:26.667
"I fear that you will learn
the lessons of beauty

21:26.709 --> 21:28.417
and injustice.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.542
That the poetry your body
can create will abandon you.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.333
That the gifts of your own
strength and passion

21:35.375 --> 21:37.458
will be dulled
before they are even born.

21:41.375 --> 21:43.709
I fear that you will cease
to yearn for flight."

21:47.000 --> 21:48.375
- Wow.

21:50.834 --> 21:52.750
Alex, that was beautiful.
- Erica!

21:54.750 --> 21:56.667
Berlin...

21:56.709 --> 21:58.375
Get lost, man.

22:00.875 --> 22:02.166
Come on, get lost!
What're you--?

22:02.208 --> 22:04.166
- Uh, Alex, I'll see you later.

22:04.208 --> 22:05.875
- You know,
I'm starting the fire,

22:05.917 --> 22:07.750
I thought you might
wanna come watch me.

22:07.792 --> 22:10.000
- Totally.

22:10.041 --> 22:11.417
Yeah.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.166
♪ No, we can't take that old
letter from my first lover ♪

22:20.792 --> 22:23.583
♪ No, we can't take anything
unto that some great other ♪

22:28.750 --> 22:30.333
♪ Every lone sock
and every diamond ♪

22:32.583 --> 22:35.375
♪ We can't prove it
'cause everybody knows ♪

22:37.041 --> 22:40.542
♪ If it's not love,
we can't take it when we go ♪

22:44.333 --> 22:47.375
♪ No, we can't take it
when we go, when we go, ♪

22:49.291 --> 22:51.625
- Hah!
♪ Wherever we go... ♪

22:53.375 --> 22:56.125
♪ If it's not love,
we can't take it when we go ♪

22:59.875 --> 23:01.750
- Hey, what're you wearing
under that skirt?

23:05.625 --> 23:08.333
- (Giggles)
- Okay, what is going on?
I mean, we can fix it.

23:09.875 --> 23:11.625
- I wanna see you naked.
- Ah...

23:11.667 --> 23:13.875
But you too.

23:13.917 --> 23:15.750
- Um... Listen, Zach,
there's something

23:17.834 --> 23:19.834
that I wanted to do to you
for a very...

23:21.500 --> 23:24.417
very long time.

23:24.458 --> 23:26.250
- Is it what I think it is?

23:35.750 --> 23:37.417
- Okay, lay down.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.625
(Water laps at the shore)

23:43.667 --> 23:45.583
But you have to keep
your eyes closed

23:45.625 --> 23:48.291
because I don't really like it
when a guy watches me do it.

23:48.333 --> 23:50.500
- Naw, you gotta show me
your tits.

23:53.291 --> 23:54.792
Come on, I wanna look at you.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.458
- Please? It's all a part
of the surprise.

24:00.917 --> 24:03.208
(Tight inhale,
exhales forcefully)

24:11.667 --> 24:13.000
(Relaxed sigh)

24:14.959 --> 24:17.667
- Okay, you can open 'em.

24:17.709 --> 24:19.500
- What the?! Jesus!

24:19.542 --> 24:21.875
- How does this feel, huh?
Is this doin' it for you, Zach?

24:23.166 --> 24:25.166
- Gimme the camera, Erica.
- Oh? Oh, you don't like this?

24:27.000 --> 24:28.792
Did you think that I would, huh?

24:28.834 --> 24:30.458
Did you think about me at all?

24:33.250 --> 24:35.417
Hey, Zach,
you know what they say about
what goes around comes around?

24:36.291 --> 24:38.333
This year is gonna be the best
it ever gets for you,

24:39.792 --> 24:41.417
so enjoy.

24:43.375 --> 24:46.250
(Water laps calmly)

24:47.792 --> 24:49.542
(Loon cries)

25:03.041 --> 25:04.875
- You're gonna spook the fish.

25:04.917 --> 25:06.792
- Catch anything?

25:06.834 --> 25:09.417
- No. Not yet.

25:09.458 --> 25:11.667
But, you know, I always like
to remain... optimistic.

25:14.041 --> 25:15.959
There's plenty of fish
in the sea,

25:16.000 --> 25:18.083
lots to choose from.

25:18.125 --> 25:20.083
- You know, after what
just happened, I...

25:20.125 --> 25:21.959
I feel like for the first time
in a really long time...

25:24.083 --> 25:26.625
(Relieved sigh)
I can start fishing myself.

25:26.667 --> 25:29.041
- Well, feel free.

25:29.083 --> 25:30.959
"Let your net always be cast.

25:32.625 --> 25:34.750
And in the pool
which you least expect..."

25:34.792 --> 25:36.959
Both: "There will be a fish."

25:37.000 --> 25:38.875
- Ovid. Yeah, I rocked
Latin Lit back in the day.

25:40.834 --> 25:42.709
- They say revenge is sweet.

25:44.458 --> 25:46.750
Would you say
that they're right?

25:46.792 --> 25:48.542
- Right or wrong...

25:50.125 --> 25:52.041
I needed him to know
how it felt.

25:52.083 --> 25:55.000
-Mm.
- And I held on to that
for so long,

25:55.041 --> 25:58.041
and it seemed so... so easy
now that I realize

25:58.083 --> 25:59.875
that just 'cause one guy
hurt me,

25:59.917 --> 26:02.417
it doesn't mean that
they all will.

26:02.458 --> 26:04.625
- Well, I can't argue with that.

26:04.667 --> 26:06.250
- Yeah.

26:07.917 --> 26:09.917
- But don't forget,
you know, it's never easy.

26:12.625 --> 26:15.792
You know, there is a difference
between knowing the path,

26:15.834 --> 26:17.834
and walking the path.

26:20.917 --> 26:22.834
- Isn't that from The Matrix?

26:22.875 --> 26:24.291
- Morpheus.

26:26.959 --> 26:28.375
Lawrence Fishburne. Man,
that's a stellar performance.

26:30.834 --> 26:32.166
(Exhales)

26:35.667 --> 26:37.333
- Erica!
- I'm here!

26:39.000 --> 26:40.625
- Oh my God,
where have you been?
- Hey, guys.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.709
- You are not gonna believe
what's going on.

26:42.750 --> 26:44.625
- Oh, Jesus, what now?

26:46.583 --> 26:48.375
(Music blasts,
low hum of chatter)

26:53.041 --> 26:54.959
Why is everyone acting
like I'm contagious?

26:56.750 --> 26:59.041
Huh?

26:59.083 --> 27:00.875
Oh my God, would you stop
with the drama

27:00.917 --> 27:02.291
and just tell me.

27:02.333 --> 27:03.625
I will survive, okay?

27:05.792 --> 27:08.834
- Okay, Zach is saying...
- That he dumped you...

27:08.875 --> 27:10.750
- because you have syphil-ass.

27:12.291 --> 27:13.959
- Come again? I have syphilis?

27:14.000 --> 27:16.041
- No-no-no, syphil-ass.
Syphilis of the ass.

27:17.625 --> 27:20.125
- What?!
- You don't, right?

27:20.166 --> 27:22.208
- Jenny!
- Look, I'm just verifying
the facts, okay?

27:22.250 --> 27:24.000
'Cause it sounds really nasty
and catchy.

27:24.041 --> 27:26.000
- (Fake cough) Syphil-ass!
- Shut up, Gary!

27:26.041 --> 27:27.709
Okay, that's it, where is he?

27:27.750 --> 27:29.417
Huh? Where is he?

27:29.458 --> 27:31.000
- Erica. Erica, wait!

27:32.542 --> 27:34.333
- Excuse me! Hi.

27:34.375 --> 27:37.333
Sorry to interrupt your
revolting public display
of affection,

27:37.375 --> 27:40.500
but it appears that
you didn't learn your lesson
earlier today.

27:42.083 --> 27:44.375
So you made up a story.
Syphil-ass, huh?

27:46.041 --> 27:49.041
I mean, that's genius, right?
Really creative, Zach.

27:49.083 --> 27:51.000
- Erica, you're embarrassing
yourself.

27:51.041 --> 27:53.750
- Katie, this has nothing
to do with you.

27:53.792 --> 27:55.625
- Why don't you get lost,
Syphil-ass. (Laughs)

27:57.291 --> 27:59.667
- (Sarcastic laugh)
- Don't talk to her like that.

28:01.166 --> 28:03.583
- Oh, excuse me, Berlin!

28:03.625 --> 28:05.625
Hoo-hoo!

28:05.667 --> 28:08.166
I think I'm gonna talk to her
however I want to. Thanks.

28:08.208 --> 28:10.125
- There's no such thing
as syphil-ass, you moron.

28:13.208 --> 28:14.709
- (Clears throat)

28:18.000 --> 28:19.709
I'm sorry?

28:19.750 --> 28:22.000
- Zach.

28:22.041 --> 28:24.041
- I said you're a moron.
- Oh.

28:25.500 --> 28:27.208
Erica: Oh!

28:27.250 --> 28:28.458
You guys!
(Struggling grunts)

28:29.959 --> 28:31.375
Stop! Stop it! Somebody!

28:32.917 --> 28:34.583
- (Hard punch)
- (Pained grunt)

28:34.625 --> 28:36.125
Alex!

28:36.166 --> 28:38.125
(Fighting grunts,
water splashes)

28:39.667 --> 28:41.166
(Onlookers chatter in shock)

28:41.208 --> 28:42.542
(Zach coughs and chokes)

28:44.250 --> 28:46.792
- Let's get outta here.

28:46.834 --> 28:48.750
Let's get out of here, come on.

28:51.667 --> 28:53.000
- (Clapping)

28:55.041 --> 28:56.750
(Crickets chirp)

28:59.250 --> 29:01.250
- Wait. Oh my God,
you're bleeding.

29:01.291 --> 29:03.750
- No-no, it's fine.
I don't even feel it.

29:03.792 --> 29:06.083
- (Exhales)
You didn't have to do that.

29:06.125 --> 29:08.083
Just, like, go after him
like that.

29:10.500 --> 29:13.250
- I've always liked you.

29:13.291 --> 29:15.625
Ever since that first day
when you thought you had
mercury poisoning.

29:15.667 --> 29:18.250
- (Laughs)

29:18.291 --> 29:20.667
- I wanted to make you
feel better, but...

29:20.709 --> 29:23.500
I didn't know what to say.

29:23.542 --> 29:25.083
I never know what to say.

29:28.125 --> 29:30.000
- Mm. (Kissing)

29:41.125 --> 29:43.041
- Um, are you okay?

29:43.083 --> 29:45.208
- Yeah, no, I'm fine.
I'm... great.

29:46.834 --> 29:48.291
- 'Cause we could go back
if you wanted to?

29:48.333 --> 29:50.500
- No-no-no, no... just, uh...

29:52.041 --> 29:53.834
Just can't believe I did that.

29:53.875 --> 29:55.625
- Me neither.

29:59.208 --> 30:01.041
(Crickets chirp,
clothing rustles)

30:16.792 --> 30:19.041
(Loon cries)

30:19.083 --> 30:20.709
(Moaning and panting)

30:22.291 --> 30:24.834
(Moans of pleasure)

30:31.750 --> 30:33.166
(Groans)

30:35.792 --> 30:38.083
(Moaning and panting)

30:42.125 --> 30:44.542
(Cry of ecstasy)

30:44.583 --> 30:47.000
(Screaming)

30:49.458 --> 30:51.291
(Scream fades)
Aahhh... Ohhh no...

30:54.792 --> 30:57.291
(Inhales and exhales)

30:57.333 --> 30:59.375
(Moans)

30:59.417 --> 31:02.333
(Breathes heavily)

31:02.375 --> 31:03.875
(Dance music plays)

31:05.709 --> 31:07.208
(Heavy breath)

31:07.250 --> 31:09.125
It's a big spider in there.

31:10.667 --> 31:12.959
- Erica, are you okay?

31:13.000 --> 31:14.709
I heard someone screaming
in there.

31:14.750 --> 31:17.250
- Oh, no, I'm fine.
(Nervous breathing)

31:21.166 --> 31:23.000
- Um, sorry if I'm staring.

31:23.041 --> 31:24.834
It's-it's just that seeing you
is a little bit more intense

31:24.875 --> 31:26.792
than I thought it would be.

31:26.834 --> 31:29.000
- I know, me too.

31:33.125 --> 31:34.917
I've still got marks on my back
from that canoe.

31:34.959 --> 31:36.875
- (Laughs)

31:36.917 --> 31:38.709
- Wow, Erica Strange.

31:40.333 --> 31:42.125
I know I shouldn't be
saying this, but...

31:42.166 --> 31:44.125
seeing you again
makes me wonder if...

31:44.166 --> 31:46.291
we hadn't gone to school on
opposite sides of the country--

31:46.333 --> 31:48.000
- What would've happened?
- Yeah.

31:48.041 --> 31:49.625
- Yeah, um...

31:51.250 --> 31:53.125
I... Alex, would you excuse me
for just a second?

31:53.166 --> 31:54.792
- Yeah.
- I will be right back.

31:54.834 --> 31:57.458
Hey, um...

31:57.500 --> 31:58.959
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.917
Alex is showing major potential
and I don't wanna blow it.

32:03.041 --> 32:05.208
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

32:05.250 --> 32:07.458
(Cringing) Oh. I mean, he's...
he's smart,

32:07.500 --> 32:09.667
and he's interesting,
and he's single,

32:09.709 --> 32:11.500
and he likes me and...

32:11.542 --> 32:13.000
the only thing standing
in the way of something

32:13.041 --> 32:15.125
is this fake relationship.

32:17.834 --> 32:20.208
- Wow.
- What? I thought that
you'd be happy for me?

32:20.542 --> 32:22.542
- I am, I just...
you barely know the guy.

32:22.583 --> 32:24.417
Just because you had sex
with him 14 years ago--

32:24.458 --> 32:25.875
- No, it's not just that.

32:25.917 --> 32:28.208
We just talked and there
was chemistry.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.583
I mean, I thought that you were
coming out to help me?

32:30.625 --> 32:32.667
Helping me right now
would be leaving.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.000
- Okay, if that's
what'll help you,

32:36.041 --> 32:37.417
I'll do it.

32:37.458 --> 32:38.959
- Thank you.

32:40.417 --> 32:41.917
'Kay.

32:41.959 --> 32:43.417
- Have a good time.
- Wish me luck.

32:43.458 --> 32:46.333
(Preparatory breath)

32:46.375 --> 32:48.041
(Smacks lips)

32:49.959 --> 32:52.083
(Muted beat of dance music)

32:54.375 --> 32:55.875
- Hey, see you.
- Hey, hey, hey!

32:57.333 --> 32:58.834
Where's Erica?

32:58.875 --> 33:00.542
- Oh, she's inside.
We, uh, we broke up.

33:01.667 --> 33:03.250
- You too, huh?
(Half laughs)

33:03.291 --> 33:05.750
She's a tough one, man.

33:05.792 --> 33:09.041
She... she had my number.

33:09.083 --> 33:11.917
The only girl to see through me
that way.

33:11.959 --> 33:14.375
But you guys look good together.

33:14.417 --> 33:16.375
A girl like that, man,
you do not just walk away from.

33:19.125 --> 33:22.166
I hope you had a good reason.

33:22.208 --> 33:24.125
- It's what she wants.

33:26.500 --> 33:28.291
(Muted beat of dance music)

33:30.458 --> 33:32.125
- (Laughing)

33:32.166 --> 33:34.000
And when you pushed him
into the water,

33:34.041 --> 33:36.041
I swear to God, I thought that
he was gonna come out of that
lake and--

33:36.083 --> 33:38.583
- Eat me for lunch?
- Yes.

33:38.625 --> 33:41.041
- My one moment of bravery.
It was so unlike me.

33:43.583 --> 33:46.208
I remember...
reading you that poem.

33:46.250 --> 33:48.792
- Mm-hmm.
- And thinking...

33:48.834 --> 33:51.166
How am I doing this?

33:51.208 --> 33:53.166
How is it possible for...

33:53.208 --> 33:55.291
this girl to make me feel
like I can do anything?

33:59.542 --> 34:02.458
- Okay, well, enough about
the past,

34:02.500 --> 34:04.583
what are you up to these days?

34:04.625 --> 34:06.417
- Well, um, my life's been
pretty busy, actually.

34:06.458 --> 34:08.125
I work the railroads.

34:08.166 --> 34:10.041
- Ooh! How very Jack Kerouac
of you.

34:11.667 --> 34:13.125
I bet that inspires
a lot of writing.

34:13.166 --> 34:15.291
- Uh, no-no-no, I mean,
I actually work for a railroad.

34:15.333 --> 34:17.166
In logistics.
- Oh.

34:17.208 --> 34:18.625
- Yeah-yeah-yeah.
- Oh, okay.

34:18.667 --> 34:20.208
- Yeah, over the past
couple years,

34:20.250 --> 34:22.291
I've really developed
a passion for trains.

34:22.333 --> 34:23.959
- Really?

34:24.000 --> 34:26.625
Um, so like the aesthetics or--

34:26.667 --> 34:29.542
- All of it. Just the
engineering, the-the look.

34:29.583 --> 34:32.458
I collect train sets. Have you
ever heard of the Maglev?

34:32.500 --> 34:35.375
- Uh... no.
- It's this really cool
levitating train.

34:35.417 --> 34:36.792
It's the fastest in the world.

34:36.834 --> 34:38.417
It's comparable
to a jet aircraft.

34:38.458 --> 34:39.750
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:39.792 --> 34:41.166
- Hmm. Wow.

34:41.208 --> 34:43.792
(Dance music plays)

34:48.291 --> 34:51.500
- I remember when you drew on
Andrew Reubenfair's penis
with a highlighter

34:51.542 --> 34:54.750
on a field trip
to the science center!

34:54.792 --> 34:57.250
- I remember when you asked
if you could get a tan

34:57.291 --> 35:00.583
sitting by the fire
at Marni Moscow's cottage!

35:00.625 --> 35:03.417
- I remember when you
used to bark back at dogs

35:03.458 --> 35:05.333
on the way to school!
(Laughing)

35:05.375 --> 35:08.083
Ruff, ruff, ruff.
- Ruff!

35:08.125 --> 35:10.709
All: (Laughing and barking)

35:10.750 --> 35:12.625
- Oh my God, I haven't laughed
this hard since high school.

35:12.667 --> 35:15.125
- I know, I know.
- (Laughing)

35:15.166 --> 35:17.000
- Where's Erica?
- I don't know!

35:17.041 --> 35:20.208
She's all gaga over Alex Berlin.

35:20.250 --> 35:23.000
- Alex Berlin?
I thought she was with Ethan?

35:24.542 --> 35:26.875
- Oh, sh... Shit.

35:28.500 --> 35:31.041
- I knew it.
- No, K-Katie, don't say
anything.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.834
- It's called electro-dynamic
suspension,

35:35.875 --> 35:37.375
or E.D.S.

35:37.417 --> 35:39.208
You see, the rail exerts
a magnetic field,

35:39.250 --> 35:41.166
and the train exerts one back.

35:41.208 --> 35:42.667
Like when you have two magnets
with the same polarity

35:42.709 --> 35:44.417
and you just can't
get them to stick.

35:44.458 --> 35:47.000
- Mmm.
Katie: Erica!

35:47.041 --> 35:50.166
- Oh. Uh, hi.
Uh... Katie, this is...

35:50.208 --> 35:52.417
Do you remember Alex Berlin?

35:52.458 --> 35:54.166
I just wanted to come over
and tell you

35:54.208 --> 35:56.291
I so enjoyed re-connecting

35:56.333 --> 35:59.709
with your very accomplished
boyfriend.

35:59.750 --> 36:02.291
Did he do his medical degree
at Harvard or Columbia?

36:02.333 --> 36:05.667
'Cause I just can't remember
which one it was.

36:05.709 --> 36:08.375
I gotta say, I'm really
surprised.

36:08.417 --> 36:10.333
Making up a fake boyfriend?

36:12.333 --> 36:15.041
That's a new low,
even for you.

36:15.083 --> 36:16.834
Excuse me.

36:18.375 --> 36:20.417
- Alex.

36:20.458 --> 36:22.750
Alex, this isn't- I mean,
it isn't what it looks like.

36:22.792 --> 36:25.041
Yes, I did make up
a fake boyfriend and...

36:27.709 --> 36:29.750
the reasons why I did it,
they're really complicated.

36:29.792 --> 36:31.291
And I just, I really hope
that you can understand--

36:31.333 --> 36:32.542
- You don't owe me
an explanation.

36:32.583 --> 36:34.125
We barely know each other,
right?

36:36.291 --> 36:38.333
Whatever's going on
between you and this guy--

36:38.375 --> 36:40.125
- No, there's nothing--
nothing's going on. There's--

36:40.166 --> 36:42.542
- Look, I just got out
of a long relationship

36:42.583 --> 36:44.542
with a woman who cheated on me.

36:46.166 --> 36:49.000
I just can't deal with baggage
right now.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.375
See you around.

36:59.458 --> 37:00.792

37:32.166 --> 37:35.083

- Trains.
- Trains.

37:41.583 --> 37:44.417
he turned around
and did it right back to me.

37:44.458 --> 37:47.166
I mean, I've never been
on the receiving end before,
where you...

37:47.208 --> 37:49.250

if he likes trains?

37:54.417 --> 37:56.000
Why does that bother me so much?

37:56.041 --> 37:57.917
I thought that I could
just get it, you know?

37:57.959 --> 37:59.709
I could understand what it was
that I was doing wrong

37:59.750 --> 38:01.709

these guys apart and I...

38:03.500 --> 38:05.625
Why can't I stop?

38:05.667 --> 38:08.500
- Because you're afraid...

38:08.542 --> 38:10.375
of what, what comes next.

38:11.917 --> 38:14.625
I mean, you wanna meet someone,
right?

38:14.667 --> 38:17.291
You want to fall in love,
but you know the risks
that lead to love.

38:17.750 --> 38:19.542
Oh, they may cause pain.

38:19.583 --> 38:21.667
And it's fear of that pain;

38:21.709 --> 38:23.750
that's what holds you back.

38:23.792 --> 38:27.375
It's what you need to let go of.

38:29.333 --> 38:31.709
- Well, that's not the question.

38:31.750 --> 38:33.625
It's not a question of whether
you can

38:33.667 --> 38:36.750
or whether you can't
'cause that's just more...

38:36.792 --> 38:39.709
Taking a risk is like,
uh... jumping off a cliff;

38:39.750 --> 38:42.542
it's a leap into the unknown

38:42.583 --> 38:45.041
with absolutely no guarantees.

38:46.625 --> 38:48.750
Ultimately, Erica,
you just have to decide.

38:50.583 --> 38:53.458
You have to choose -
how are you going to be?

38:53.500 --> 38:55.709
I mean, you could spend
the rest of your life

38:55.750 --> 38:57.500
caught up in that fear. Okay.

39:00.375 --> 39:03.166
Or you could face it,
take the leap.

39:06.250 --> 39:08.083

Voicemail: Hello, Erica,
Ambrose Kincaid here.

40:15.875 --> 40:17.667
I'm calling with good news.

40:17.709 --> 40:19.375
I'd like to offer you
the assistant position.

40:23.333 --> 40:25.166
(Phone beeps off,
phone snaps shut)

40:28.542 --> 40:29.959
(Door clicks open)

40:30.000 --> 40:31.709
- I brought ice cream.

40:31.750 --> 40:33.709
- What happened to Alex?

40:33.750 --> 40:35.959
- Didn't work out.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.417
- That's too bad.
- Listen, Ethan. (Sighs)

40:39.959 --> 40:41.750
I owe you a huge apology.

40:41.792 --> 40:43.250
- No. No, you don't.

40:44.792 --> 40:46.625
- No, you were great tonight.

40:46.667 --> 40:48.959
- Well, I'm a good actor.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.250
Honestly though, the thought of
going back out on the market,

40:51.291 --> 40:52.583
playing the game in real life,

40:52.625 --> 40:54.834
makes me wanna throw up.

40:54.875 --> 40:57.333
- Ethan.
- Sometimes I wake up
in the morning, alone in bed,

40:57.375 --> 40:59.125
and think, "what if this is it?

41:00.709 --> 41:03.208
What if I never find
someone else?"

41:03.250 --> 41:06.000
I mean, if guys are getting
shot down for having African
mask collections,

41:06.041 --> 41:07.917
it's not looking too good
for me.

41:07.959 --> 41:10.750
- What're you talking about?
You are amazing.

41:10.792 --> 41:13.417
- I'm damaged goods,
and hardly sexy on paper.

41:13.458 --> 41:14.875
An elementary school teacher?

41:14.917 --> 41:16.667
- Uh, your kids write you
fan mail.

41:16.709 --> 41:19.000
- Who still play video games?
- Whoa! I love the Wii.

41:19.041 --> 41:21.208
And talks in his sleep -
Claire used to hate that,

41:21.250 --> 41:23.834
I'd always wake her up.

41:23.875 --> 41:26.375
- (Half laughs)
Do you remember...

41:26.417 --> 41:27.792
when we were roommates
in third year,

41:27.834 --> 41:30.375
and you had the nightmare
about the letters?

41:30.417 --> 41:32.458
- Oh God.

41:32.500 --> 41:34.417
- It was so cute.
It took me like ten minutes

41:34.458 --> 41:35.792
to realize that
you were sleeping.

41:35.834 --> 41:37.709
I had no idea why suddenly...

41:37.750 --> 41:39.750
you thought you were a mailman.
and standing in my room.

41:39.792 --> 41:41.291
- Please don't.

41:41.333 --> 41:44.166
- And, I mean, I took you
back to your bed

41:44.208 --> 41:46.834
and I assured you that
everything was gonna be okay;

41:46.875 --> 41:48.542
people were gonna
get their mail.

41:48.583 --> 41:50.583
And then you went back to bed.
