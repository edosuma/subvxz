00:50.718 --> 00:53.345
SORT OF FIGHT, I GUESS.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.805
THE COPS CAME.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.805

SCHEME OF THINGS,

01:02.980 --> 01:04.606
BUT STILL TEN MINUTES

01:02.980 --> 01:04.606
IS TEN MINUTES.

01:04.648 --> 01:06.316
SURE, YEAH.

01:04.648 --> 01:06.316
TEN MINUTES IS GREAT.

01:06.358 --> 01:07.943
AND THEN THE PHONE RINGS.

01:07.985 --> 01:11.112
IT JUST RINGS AND RINGS

01:07.985 --> 01:11.112

01:12.781 --> 01:14.825
THAT'S A LOT OF RINGS.

01:14.867 --> 01:17.494
ON THE OTHER END OF

01:14.867 --> 01:17.494
THE PHONE IS SOMEONE NAMED JOHN

01:17.536 --> 01:19.204
WHO SAYS HE'S KYLE'S FATHER,

BUT I THINK HIS NAME RHYMES

01:40.434 --> 01:42.185

01:56.450 --> 01:58.410

THAT'S WHY THE COPS CAME?

01:59.453 --> 02:01.413

04:21.636 --> 04:23.555
I DIDN'T KNOW

04:21.636 --> 04:23.555
YOU WERE IN TOUCH.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.599
I'M NOT. RORY IS.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.599
AH.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.142
AT LEAST THE FAMILY

04:25.640 --> 04:27.142

04:28.643 --> 04:31.105
I MEAN, BEFORE THIS WHOLE

04:28.643 --> 04:31.105
FRIDAY NIGHT DINNER THING,

04:31.146 --> 04:33.356
I DIDN'T SEE THEM REGULARLY,

04:31.146 --> 04:33.356
WE DIDN'T TALK REGULARLY,

04:33.398 --> 04:35.400
SO IT WASN'T WEIRD

04:33.398 --> 04:35.400
WHEN I DIDN'T SEE THEM

04:35.442 --> 04:37.318
OR TALK TO THEM REGULARLY.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.737
YOU MISS THEM.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.364
I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT DOING

04:38.779 --> 04:41.364
SOMETHING I'M SUPPOSED TO.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.366
SO WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO?

04:41.406 --> 04:43.366
HOPE IT PASSES.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.493
SOUNDS HEALTHY.

04:45.535 --> 04:49.539
BLESSED ARE THEY WHO MOURN,

04:45.535 --> 04:49.539
FOR THEY WILL BE COMFORTED.

04:49.581 --> 04:51.416
BLESSED ARE THE MEEK

04:51.458 --> 04:54.044

04:55.420 --> 04:58.215
HOW WERE THINGS LAST NIGHT?

04:58.257 --> 05:00.634
YOU MEAN AFTER MY

04:58.257 --> 05:00.634
DRUNKEN CALL TO MY MOTHER?

05:00.675 --> 05:02.510
YEAH, WHAT HAPPENED

05:00.675 --> 05:02.510
WHEN YOU GOT HOME?

05:02.552 --> 05:04.471
I'M NOT SURE.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.471
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

05:04.512 --> 05:05.931
WELL, AFTER I FINISHED

05:05.973 --> 05:07.808
WITH MY FARRELLY BROTHERS

05:05.973 --> 05:07.808
AUDITION IN THE BUSHES --

05:07.849 --> 05:10.018
THANKS FOR THE HAIR HOLDING.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.018
ANYTIME.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.352
DAVE DROPPED ME OFF AT HOME.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.605
HE WANTED TO COME IN,

05:11.394 --> 05:13.605
BUT HE'S AN ONLY CHILD,

05:13.647 --> 05:17.484
AND I SAW NO REASON FOR HIS

05:13.647 --> 05:17.484
FAMILY LINE TO END WITH HIM,

05:17.525 --> 05:18.819
SO I WENT IN AND HE LEFT.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.570
AND?

05:18.860 --> 05:20.570
THE PLACE WAS DARK.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.447
NO MRS. KIM?

05:20.612 --> 05:22.447
NO MRS. KIM.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.740
NO MRS. KIM.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.408
SO, OF COURSE, I PANICKED.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.618
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

05:26.660 --> 05:27.619
WHEN I'M HOME

05:26.660 --> 05:27.619
TEN MINUTES LATE

05:27.661 --> 05:29.579
FROM BIBLE STUDY,

05:27.661 --> 05:29.579
SHE HAS A COW.

05:29.621 --> 05:32.415
BUT I CALL HER DRUNK,

05:29.621 --> 05:32.415
TELL HER I'M AT A PARTY,
