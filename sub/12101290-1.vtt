00:43.588 --> 00:45.688
<i>Get insurance cover for free...</i>

00:45.821 --> 00:49.189
<i>..Drugs are a big problem.
They, they have an involuntary effect...</i>

00:49.323 --> 00:51.189
<i>..a very modern way of thinking...</i>

00:51.323 --> 00:57.889
- <i>..it's been almost a year since...</i>
- <i>..on Sunday. Hurry, hurry, hurry...</i>

01:18.621 --> 01:22.588
<i>They say the summer when you finish
school is the best time of your life</i>

01:22.721 --> 01:27.621
<i>because it's your final summer of freedom
and you become a man.</i>

01:28.588 --> 01:30.721
<i>It's important.</i>

01:30.856 --> 01:34.189
<i>I just didn't realise
how important it would be.</i>

01:35.256 --> 01:39.721
<i>This is a real story.
These things happened.</i>

01:40.323 --> 01:43.688
<i>I'm sorry for some of the choices
I've made.</i>

01:44.856 --> 01:47.023
<i>But only some of them.</i>

01:50.822 --> 01:54.123
So, Matthew, this is it.

01:55.422 --> 01:58.056
Are you excited?

01:58.889 --> 02:03.521
Matthew, I asked you if you're excited.
Are you still with me?

02:05.223 --> 02:07.755
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

02:09.089 --> 02:14.588
- Have you enjoyed your time here?
- Sure, yeah.

02:15.256 --> 02:18.621
So, you'll be looking forward
to your freedom away from school?

02:22.822 --> 02:25.023
I was expecting more of a discussion.

02:26.422 --> 02:29.323
When you leave the room,
this part of your life is over.

02:29.455 --> 02:35.156
- Do we really have to do this?
- These are questions I ask everybody.

02:35.290 --> 02:39.856
Look, Mr Landerton,
if it makes you happy for your report,

02:39.989 --> 02:43.356
just write that I've improved
as an individual,

02:43.488 --> 02:48.023
grown into a respectable young scholar
and it's all cos of you.

02:58.621 --> 03:03.323
I know it's been difficult for a while,

03:03.454 --> 03:05.923
but I have high hopes for you.

03:06.756 --> 03:09.554
Be careful with your choices.

03:10.521 --> 03:12.688
Thanks.

03:14.089 --> 03:15.889
Can I go now?

04:09.089 --> 04:10.554
Wreck everything!

04:10.689 --> 04:13.989
Hey, or Mr Jingles'll get ya.

04:14.123 --> 04:16.521
- How are you, buddy?
- I'm good.

04:16.655 --> 04:18.223
- Took your time getting out.
- Yeah.

04:18.356 --> 04:20.923
Well, we can't all get expelled
for being a dickhead, can we?

04:21.056 --> 04:23.554
- Oh, come on, bro.
- Where's Rez?

04:23.689 --> 04:25.756
Said he's gonna meet us at the church.

04:25.889 --> 04:28.023
- It's good to see ya.
- It's good to see you.

04:28.156 --> 04:32.822
- How was that Landerton fool?
- Ah, you know, a prick.

04:39.355 --> 04:41.421
Ah, fuck!

04:44.856 --> 04:47.656
Come on.

05:14.156 --> 05:19.956
- God is in his church.
- And Elvis has left the building.

05:22.056 --> 05:24.923
- You pair ready to do this?
- Course we are.

05:25.056 --> 05:28.189
- Fuck, yeah.
- Body of Christ.

05:28.554 --> 05:30.956
Amen.

06:12.089 --> 06:14.355
- Let's get moving. Come on, let's go.
- I want green.

06:14.488 --> 06:16.123
Give us the green.

06:24.488 --> 06:27.322
Looks pretty good, lads. Pretty good.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.223
We're such wankers!

06:29.956 --> 06:32.023
Let's get out of here, man.

06:40.023 --> 06:40.889
Why?

06:41.023 --> 06:43.089
- Why not?
- Are you mental?

06:43.222 --> 06:45.856
Oh, shit! OK, come on. Let's go.

06:45.989 --> 06:49.889
- Matthew, come on, let's go.
- Oh, shit.

06:57.389 --> 07:01.023
- Is that Mr Landerton's car?
- Kearney, man, we're done.

07:01.156 --> 07:03.355
- Fuck you, Mr Landerton!
- Kearney!

07:03.488 --> 07:06.989
- Kick me out of your school, will ya?
- We're done, man!

07:07.622 --> 07:11.355
- This is for every detention!
- That's for every letter home!

07:11.488 --> 07:15.255
This is for every time you called my Da!
That's cos you're fat!

07:15.389 --> 07:18.089
This is cos you only wear
one fucking suit!

07:18.222 --> 07:19.789
Agh!

07:45.421 --> 07:48.023
Matthew?

07:53.789 --> 07:55.889
I think your car is broken, sir.

07:57.856 --> 08:01.322
- I expected more from you, Matthew.
- What, not from me?

08:01.455 --> 08:03.322
Oh, sir, I'm offended

08:03.455 --> 08:06.956
- You didn't need to do that.
- Come and have a drink with us.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.255
I have to ring your parents.

08:10.389 --> 08:12.322
- I don't want to.
- Landerton.

08:12.455 --> 08:14.188
Our parents couldn't really give a fuck.

08:14.322 --> 08:19.222
Don't listen to him, Matthew.
You don't have to do as he says any more.

08:19.355 --> 08:23.089
Matthew, is this who you want to be?

08:37.122 --> 08:38.023
Fuck you!

08:43.056 --> 08:44.422
Go, go, go!

09:08.889 --> 09:13.322
- Oh! Come on, man!
- Oh, he's fucked!

09:13.455 --> 09:15.789
- You've given up?
- Come on!

09:25.522 --> 09:27.522
- What's up, man?
- How are you?

09:27.656 --> 09:31.255
Oh, this is it! This is end of year party!

09:34.856 --> 09:39.956
Let's fucking go! Let's fucking GO!

10:47.722 --> 10:51.088
Get the fuck out of here now.
Get out of here!

11:51.889 --> 11:55.223
So, then you end up in England
and you have to take the war to the Brits

11:55.356 --> 11:58.822
fucking bombing trains and shit
and shooting everybody.

11:58.955 --> 12:02.223
And then at the end,
you have to assassinate the queen!

12:02.356 --> 12:04.055
So they made a game about the IRA

12:04.188 --> 12:06.356
where you have to plant bombs
and kill the fucking queen?

12:06.489 --> 12:10.522
No, it's a game I invented. "Call Of
The Provos", that's what I'm naming it.

12:10.656 --> 12:13.088
- Sounds great, I'll play.
- Exactly.

12:13.223 --> 12:15.955
Tell me you wouldn't play
that fucking game.

12:16.088 --> 12:17.756
I probably wouldn't man.

12:17.888 --> 12:23.189
Boys, we're free!
Here we are on the other side!

12:23.323 --> 12:25.356
Over, we made it.

12:25.489 --> 12:27.356
So, how'd it go?

12:27.489 --> 12:29.455
Er, yeah. Yeah, man.

12:29.589 --> 12:32.256
Really? Have you figured out
what you're all gonna do now?

12:32.390 --> 12:35.455
Yeah, I worked out
me life spreadsheet last night.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.155
- Get high.
- Make video games.

12:37.290 --> 12:40.922
Hm. Good. I'm going to be
the next female president of the UN.

12:41.055 --> 12:45.022
- Seems like a lot of work.
- Huh, you're right. Fuck it.

12:46.822 --> 12:51.256
- Ah! All of the happy families.
- Poor bastards!

12:51.390 --> 12:54.955
Once you have kids,
that's everything fucked!

12:56.122 --> 12:59.756
- May as well give up at that point.
- Jesus, that's dark.

12:59.888 --> 13:01.988
Actually, Jen,
I think you'd look great pregnant.

13:02.122 --> 13:04.156
Has anyone told you
you have a punchable face, Kearney?

13:04.290 --> 13:06.922
- I'm going for a walk.
- I was just trying to be nice.

13:07.055 --> 13:12.156
- Sure. Do you have another can?
- No, but I have this.

13:12.290 --> 13:13.855
Legend!

13:44.290 --> 13:46.722
Jen wants your dick!

13:48.489 --> 13:50.123
Oh, what?

13:50.256 --> 13:53.489
So, do you know what you'll do
if you don't get the points for college?

13:53.622 --> 13:57.689
Not really. Just get a job, I suppose.

14:00.022 --> 14:03.022
I don't want a career or any of that crap.

14:04.022 --> 14:05.756
There's nothing here I want to do.

14:05.888 --> 14:08.555
Are you really planning on going away?

14:09.290 --> 14:13.756
Yeah. I think it'd be nice to experience
a different culture, you know.

14:13.888 --> 14:16.522
I get the feeling
it's the same everywhere.

14:18.290 --> 14:22.223
You know, just like America.
You know, like on TV.

14:22.356 --> 14:25.955
Everywhere you go,
you'll probably still be in America.

14:26.089 --> 14:30.189
You can't really get away from it.
Do you know what I mean?

14:32.955 --> 14:34.855
So why go there if it's all the same?

14:34.988 --> 14:38.489
How would you know what something's like
if you've never been there before?

14:40.855 --> 14:44.455
- Kiss! Kiss! Pretend like we're not her
- Fuck off!

14:44.589 --> 14:47.522
- What?
- Check it out.

14:48.123 --> 14:50.256
Just got these
from a guy round the corner.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.589
Jen, would you finally like
to try the dark side?

14:54.555 --> 14:56.223
Not for me, thanks.

14:56.356 --> 15:00.656
Actually, I've got to go.
My dad's got a family thing planned. So.

15:01.422 --> 15:04.555
Freedom, boys. Use it wisely.

15:05.555 --> 15:09.189
- Man! Great arse!
- Fucking muppet!

15:09.323 --> 15:10.622
What?

15:10.755 --> 15:13.189
Forgive us, Lord, for we have sinned.

15:14.755 --> 15:16.256
- Amen.
- Amen.

15:36.955 --> 15:39.589
I got a job.
I'm going to America.

15:39.721 --> 15:42.455
I'm going to work on a building site
with my brother. Gonna tear it up, like.

15:42.589 --> 15:44.323
- America?
- Yeah, man!

15:44.455 --> 15:47.489
You can do what you want there,
the land of the free and all.

15:47.622 --> 15:51.721
Get a gun, get obese,
fuck any girl you like.

15:51.855 --> 15:55.688
It's gonna be deadly.
God is in his church.

15:55.821 --> 15:58.555
I gotta piss in a proper jacks.

16:08.455 --> 16:10.256
- You really going?
- Yeah, man.

16:10.390 --> 16:13.089
It's gonna be deadly, bro.
It's gonna be deadly.

16:13.223 --> 16:15.989
You need to see my brother.
He has the best time.

16:16.123 --> 16:18.522
- He does what he likes, you know.
- No way!

16:19.123 --> 16:22.455
Where is fucking Rez, man?
He's taking forever.

17:00.721 --> 17:04.888
Help! Somebody help me!

17:05.455 --> 17:06.956
What the fuck?

17:07.089 --> 17:10.023
Nobody should ever have to see
such a thing, boys.

17:11.721 --> 17:14.455
I hope to God you all get over it.

17:15.855 --> 17:19.089
Well, thanks for your statements.

17:19.821 --> 17:21.655
I'll see you out.

17:21.788 --> 17:24.323
It just happened in front of us.

17:24.455 --> 17:26.655
It was terrible.

17:26.788 --> 17:28.755
Just seeing that little girl like that.

17:55.256 --> 17:56.889
<i>..travel the world!</i>

18:06.290 --> 18:09.755
You're in late. Are you OK?

18:10.422 --> 18:12.023
Yep.

18:20.956 --> 18:22.989
I think I should take that job.

18:24.721 --> 18:27.056
Time for me to grow up a bit.

18:33.923 --> 18:37.023
- Buy! Buy! Buy!
- <i>This is an ad to make you buy stuff.</i>

18:37.156 --> 18:40.489
<i>Hurry up and come buy my stuff
before it's gone.</i>

18:45.856 --> 18:47.923
We saw a girl die today.

18:49.856 --> 18:50.989
What?

18:52.089 --> 18:55.588
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

19:01.422 --> 19:05.822
<i>Eenie, meenie, minie... Mo.</i>

19:05.956 --> 19:09.023
<i>Let's put our contestants to the test.</i>

19:09.156 --> 19:12.455
- <i>Examine their deepest fears...</i>
- Get me a beer.

19:13.123 --> 19:16.588
<i>I'm Darren.</i>

19:20.956 --> 19:24.455
This guy is good.
He knows how to get at people.

19:24.588 --> 19:27.189
- <i>..Kansas City.</i>
- Poor saps!

19:27.323 --> 19:31.454
<i>Have you ever been to Hawaii? No?</i>

19:31.588 --> 19:33.123
He knows their weaknesses.

19:33.256 --> 19:36.989
<i>Then why are you wearing a Hawaiian shirt?
Loser!</i>

19:37.123 --> 19:40.089
Yeah, yeah, he does.

19:40.223 --> 19:42.356
<i>Sit down! Sit down!</i>

19:42.488 --> 19:49.422
I, um... I saw a girl
get knocked over today. She died.

19:51.688 --> 19:54.956
- But you're fine?
- Yeah.

19:55.655 --> 19:58.089
Good. It happens.

19:59.422 --> 20:03.156
- <i>American forces have liberated Baghdad.</i>
- Stay on that.

20:05.123 --> 20:08.123
You don't think
you're gonna be a soldier?

20:08.521 --> 20:12.323
- I could be a soldier.
- You wouldn't last a day in there!

20:12.454 --> 20:14.521
Soldier, me hole!

20:14.655 --> 20:16.621
Yeah, look at him!

20:16.756 --> 20:19.621
Eejit!

20:22.323 --> 20:26.454
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
let's have a very warm welcome...</i>

20:26.588 --> 20:28.688
Ah! Yeah!

20:28.822 --> 20:30.722
Rez!

20:31.454 --> 20:33.554
Oh, fuck!

20:40.356 --> 20:42.588
That was really lovely.

20:42.722 --> 20:45.290
- Was it?
- It always is.

20:45.856 --> 20:48.056
- You're great.
- Oh, sure.

20:50.722 --> 20:54.290
Were you watching us? Did we look hot?

20:54.956 --> 20:58.621
- I don't know. I guess.
- Something wrong with your eyes?

20:59.421 --> 21:02.189
Nothing wrong with my eyes.

21:03.256 --> 21:07.056
Julie, um... when you look at things,
you're not just thinking they're beautiful

21:07.189 --> 21:12.889
because you've seen so many pictures of
them before, but really you feel nothing.

21:15.355 --> 21:17.989
Or maybe what you're really admiring
is just yourself,

21:18.123 --> 21:21.089
saying, you know,
"This is what an experience looks like."

21:22.089 --> 21:25.789
Only you've never really had one,
you know?

21:27.323 --> 21:28.323
No.

21:29.554 --> 21:34.554
I look at a sunset and at sex
and at you and I like it.

21:35.189 --> 21:36.756
I think it's gorgeous.

21:36.889 --> 21:39.123
It's very simple, Rez.

21:40.189 --> 21:42.223
Yeah. Maybe.

21:42.822 --> 21:47.189
Sometimes, it just feels all false. I feel
like I'm being tricked in a feeling.

21:48.156 --> 21:52.689
Silly Dino. There are no tricks in school.

22:05.822 --> 22:09.588
Look, you've got to face death
head on, man.

22:09.722 --> 22:12.322
Look it in the eye and say, "Fuck you!"

22:12.454 --> 22:14.056
You know what I mean?

22:14.189 --> 22:18.889
Death is necessary.
You can't have life without death.

22:19.789 --> 22:21.722
You don't know what you're talking about

22:21.856 --> 22:24.488
Jesus, Rez!
I don't know what I'm talking about?

22:24.622 --> 22:27.289
You can't learn everything
from books, Rez.

22:27.421 --> 22:32.454
Life and death, they're not fucking word
OK? It's real. Right, Matthew?

22:32.589 --> 22:34.223
Just give it a rest, Kearney.

22:34.355 --> 22:36.454
Oh, Jesus!

22:37.023 --> 22:41.589
You're so fucking soft, man. So soft!
That's why I'm going to America.

22:41.722 --> 22:45.389
They don't give a fuck.
That's why they run the place.

22:45.521 --> 22:47.156
I leave tomorrow, actually.

22:47.289 --> 22:50.923
Do youse want to get fucked up,
celebrate the summer?

22:51.056 --> 22:55.123
You know, I'm actually...
I'm not in the mood to hang out.

22:55.255 --> 22:58.622
- You lads carry on, though.
- Rez? Rez, fucking hell, man.

22:58.756 --> 23:03.289
You're not gonna change anything by being
upset and sad and crying and all that.

23:03.421 --> 23:05.822
It's not gonna bring the girl back, is it?

23:16.322 --> 23:19.689
Jesus! What's his fucking problem?

23:38.756 --> 23:42.389
Matthew...
are you still thinking about it?

23:45.454 --> 23:47.622
I can't stop.

23:48.189 --> 23:50.255
Well...

23:50.389 --> 23:54.555
Good, because you can't pretend
that wasn't fucking incredible.

24:00.489 --> 24:05.089
The girl died, Kearney. That was real.

24:05.222 --> 24:07.289
I know that, Matthew.

24:07.421 --> 24:09.222
I do, I know that.

24:09.355 --> 24:12.689
I'm not saying it was a good thing the
girl died. I think it's fucking terrible

24:13.222 --> 24:16.756
But the fact is, we didn't do it.
It wasn't us.

24:17.589 --> 24:20.421
It would have happened anyway. Look...

24:21.123 --> 24:25.389
..all I'm saying is
that actually being there,

24:25.522 --> 24:27.722
actually seeing it with me own eyes.

24:27.856 --> 24:29.923
Oh, man! It's exhilarating.

24:30.056 --> 24:33.722
I'm just glad it wasn't one of us, though.

24:35.289 --> 24:37.056
It was a fucking strange feeling.

24:38.056 --> 24:39.856
It was intense.

24:39.989 --> 24:44.155
<i>Like being aware of... breathing.</i>

24:46.989 --> 24:49.188
<i>It just makes you appreciate being alive.</i>

24:51.355 --> 24:53.188
Exactly.

24:53.322 --> 24:55.622
It was powerful, man.

24:56.255 --> 25:02.089
My head has never felt so fucking clear.
I feel awake, man.

25:02.222 --> 25:07.555
- I really do.
- Kearney, I don't get what you mean.

25:17.389 --> 25:20.956
Nothing, man. Never mind.

25:22.023 --> 25:23.889
Enjoy America!

25:24.555 --> 25:28.489
- I'm gonna own the place.
- Of course you will.

25:28.622 --> 25:30.956
- Bye.
- Have a good summer.

26:21.822 --> 26:27.489
Kearney! Kearney!
Kearney! Kearney!

26:28.155 --> 26:33.356
Ladies and gentlemen, let's have a nice
warm welcome for our special guest.

26:33.489 --> 26:35.789
Joseph Kearney!

26:39.390 --> 26:45.122
Welcome to America. We are thrilled to
have you here. We adore you. We adore you.

26:45.255 --> 26:46.756
Please, sit.

26:46.889 --> 26:50.222
Now... before I continue,

26:50.356 --> 26:54.689
I'm duty bound to ask you
some serious questions.

26:54.822 --> 26:56.989
- Ooooh!
- Fire away.

26:57.122 --> 27:01.923
Are you now or have you ever been
a member of a terrorist organisation?

27:03.088 --> 27:04.188
No.

27:05.889 --> 27:08.589
Are you sure? Are you sure?
Are you sure?

27:10.155 --> 27:12.122
Shame.

27:14.555 --> 27:18.055
- Would you kill another person?
- Well, if they deserved it, yeah.

27:18.188 --> 27:20.122
Of course!

27:20.255 --> 27:23.555
But who decides that
Who decides that?

27:29.988 --> 27:33.889
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No, not yet.

27:34.022 --> 27:38.988
That's OK. Loneliness can't kill you.

27:39.722 --> 27:43.589
So... how does it feel to be here?

27:44.188 --> 27:47.088
I mean, I want to experience
some real shit.

27:47.222 --> 27:51.088
You know, I'm just so tired of being told
what to do all the time.

27:51.222 --> 27:53.489
Just get out of my face!

27:53.622 --> 27:56.290
I've got my older brother, Dwayne, here.
He's showing me the ropes.

27:56.422 --> 27:59.622
Dwayne, stand up.
He just gets wrecked all the time.

27:59.756 --> 28:01.722
He's a total fucking player!

28:01.856 --> 28:04.290
Like when
the Kearney brothers come in,

28:04.422 --> 28:07.589
everyone's gonna know
what the fuck is going on!

28:07.722 --> 28:09.889
- Yeah!
- Sounds amazing!

28:11.955 --> 28:16.422
You caught me!
Coke, fucking wonder drug, right?

28:24.022 --> 28:26.323
- Kearney! Kearney!
- Matthew!

28:26.455 --> 28:30.223
<i>America's the place to be.
Not like the same old shit in Ireland.</i>

28:30.356 --> 28:33.589
<i>You'd better not be crying
cos you miss me!</i>

28:38.756 --> 28:43.088
- Have you got any Jacks?
- No. Go fish.

28:43.223 --> 28:45.223
All right.

28:45.356 --> 28:47.555
Have you got any sixes?

28:49.323 --> 28:50.988
Go fish.

28:51.122 --> 28:52.589
Drink, go on.

28:54.022 --> 28:56.789
Urgh!

28:57.622 --> 29:01.055
- Ha-ha-ha! I win!
- What?

29:01.555 --> 29:03.856
- Never! You cheated!
- No, I didn't.

29:03.988 --> 29:06.555
Don't you know the rules to this game?
It's very simple.

29:06.689 --> 29:09.555
You're so cheeky! Submit!

29:09.689 --> 29:10.988
- Never!
- Submit!

29:11.122 --> 29:14.122
You wouldn't like me if I did.
Stop.

29:27.122 --> 29:29.455
Whoa! Easy, tiger.

29:29.589 --> 29:31.922
I don't want to. Well, not yet.

29:32.822 --> 29:35.988
Oh, yeah, you're right. Er...

29:37.256 --> 29:39.088
Er...

29:39.223 --> 29:41.323
Are you still leaving?

29:41.455 --> 29:44.156
Maybe. What's it to you?

29:45.888 --> 29:48.455
- Nothing, just wanted to ask something.
- Oh, yeah?

29:48.589 --> 29:50.189
Yeah, er...

29:51.988 --> 29:54.622
Go on. Don't be lame, ask me.

29:57.555 --> 30:00.088
Will you be my girlfriend?

30:00.689 --> 30:02.789
Oh! Um...

30:02.922 --> 30:06.489
Shit, Matthew, I don't really know
how to say this, but, um...

30:06.622 --> 30:10.722
I think I need a formal written request
so I can review the application.

30:12.356 --> 30:13.722
Yes.

30:13.855 --> 30:15.789
- Oh.
- I would.

30:39.356 --> 30:41.656
- Jen?
- Hm?

30:44.390 --> 30:46.888
I should go. I have work early.

30:48.656 --> 30:52.455
- I'll come and see you tomorrow.
- OK.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.455
Mmm.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.422
- Follow me.
- What's going on?

31:31.555 --> 31:34.755
- Just keep following, going straight.
- Sure you know where you're going?

31:34.888 --> 31:38.089
Keep going straight. Right.
We've got to be careful, right?

31:38.223 --> 31:41.223
- Careful? What are you doing?
- Are we clear?

31:41.356 --> 31:43.455
- Clear of what?
- Security!

31:43.589 --> 31:45.622
Dude, I'm just following you.

31:45.755 --> 31:48.622
- Are we?
- Yeah, sure. What now?

31:48.755 --> 31:52.988
We do... this!

31:56.555 --> 31:59.589
Do you remember doing this as kids
but with finger painting?

31:59.721 --> 32:01.855
Yeah, I do.

32:01.988 --> 32:05.123
- Feels exactly the same.
- What do you think?

32:05.888 --> 32:08.721
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- It's nice!

32:09.256 --> 32:11.821
Oh, my God, man!

32:12.390 --> 32:14.955
This one? Yeah. Step aside.

32:17.589 --> 32:19.955
You've ruined it. What?

32:20.089 --> 32:23.455
Come on, give me that back.

32:23.589 --> 32:25.788
- Give me the can!
- Ah!

32:28.023 --> 32:31.156
Right, come on.
We've got to get outta here, all right.

32:32.555 --> 32:34.721
- You fucking ruined that. It was good.
- Stop!

32:34.855 --> 32:38.455
- The best heart I've ever drawn.
- Be quiet. Act natural.

- Yeah.

33:40.855 --> 33:43.621

as badly as possible.

- Uh, Jen, here put this on.
- Oh, thanks, man.

33:53.956 --> 33:56.855
You ready for some pills?

33:56.989 --> 34:00.588
Fuck yeah! Jen, what do you think?
You want to try?

34:00.721 --> 34:02.621

- Amen.
- Amen.

34:07.989 --> 34:10.755
Can you spare any change, lads?

34:11.621 --> 34:14.923
Sorry to disturb and all that,
but I'm looking for some spare change

34:15.056 --> 34:18.323
for a hostel, for a bed,
for a roof over my head.

34:18.455 --> 34:21.555
So sorry, I've nothing. Matthew?

34:22.290 --> 34:26.089
They say the angels cry with jealousy
looking upon your face.

34:27.156 --> 34:28.755
Thank you. Thank you.

34:28.889 --> 34:30.956
- That's all right.
- You're a good one, you.

34:31.089 --> 34:34.621
Huh? She's a keeper, boy.
What is your name, Angel?

34:34.755 --> 34:37.621
- I'm Jen. Nice to meet you.
- Jen.

34:39.655 --> 34:41.290

34:41.422 --> 34:45.989

Club. Drugs. Wanking into a cake.
More drinking. Drugs.

37:39.655 --> 37:43.689
One day becoming the next. I don't when
started or ended. Naked women. Drugs.

37:43.822 --> 37:46.290
Greed. We own the place. Real men!

37:51.123 --> 37:54.621
Tell us, Joseph,
what is it that girls want?

37:54.756 --> 37:58.223
They want me to take control, be a man.

37:58.355 --> 38:00.789
Be strong!

38:11.923 --> 38:16.756
- What did I do to you?
- It's not you. It's me.

38:20.822 --> 38:24.056
On second thought, it's you, Joseph.

38:25.421 --> 38:28.223
What did you do? What did you do?

38:28.355 --> 38:30.689
Did you dominate them?

38:32.189 --> 38:34.056
Control them?

38:34.822 --> 38:38.454
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

38:40.656 --> 38:42.689
You don't need to do this.

38:44.889 --> 38:47.089
You don't need to do this.

38:54.223 --> 38:58.454
- This is not OK. I did not pick me...
- Ssh!

38:58.589 --> 39:01.123
- Please?
- It's OK.

39:05.056 --> 39:09.289
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a real man

39:09.421 --> 39:13.656
Real man! The real man! Joseph Kearney!

39:22.488 --> 39:24.389
Matthew, you've got to come to this place.

39:24.521 --> 39:26.656
You'll love it!
You can get away with murder over here.

39:26.789 --> 39:28.656
<i>It's deadly!</i>

39:28.789 --> 39:31.089
- Matthew?
- Mm-hm?

39:34.555 --> 39:37.521
Oh, you're awake.

39:38.856 --> 39:40.756
Something's happened.

39:42.355 --> 39:44.756
Something's happened to Rez.

40:05.454 --> 40:09.756
Oh, fucking hell, man!
What were you up to?

40:11.856 --> 40:16.421
- You didn't notice.
- We thought you'd left, Rez.

40:17.956 --> 40:21.389
I'm sorry, man, we were drunk
and I didn't think...

40:21.522 --> 40:24.656
- Matthew, do you really care?
- What?

40:26.289 --> 40:28.156
What do you mean do I care?

40:28.289 --> 40:32.056
Are you sure you really care
or is it not that it excites you?

40:33.389 --> 40:36.789
Cos that's how I'd feel if a mate of mine
had tried to kill himself.

40:37.156 --> 40:41.856
I'd be dead excited about all the drama
and the glamour and the emotion.

40:41.989 --> 40:44.756
Something to talk about with Jen.

40:45.522 --> 40:48.355
- Maybe use it to finally get in with her.
- What, man, no!

40:48.489 --> 40:53.589
It would make you more interesting.
"Oh, it's rough. My mate killed himself.

40:54.255 --> 40:57.689
You'd love it, you and Kearney both,
you all would,

40:57.822 --> 40:59.956
just as I'd love it
if you went and did yourself in.

41:00.089 --> 41:01.889
- Listen, man, you're my mate...
- Fuck off, man!

41:02.023 --> 41:03.989
- You're not my fucking mate!
- You need to chill out, man.

41:04.123 --> 41:06.489
- Piss off out of here man!
- Rez, you need to chill out!

41:06.622 --> 41:08.889
Get lost, all right? Fucking piss off!

41:10.289 --> 41:13.255
- I don't fucking want you here.
- All right, fine.

41:13.389 --> 41:15.023
Bye.

41:15.155 --> 41:16.989
<i>I'm so hungry!</i>

41:17.123 --> 41:20.389
<i>With crunchy goodness and lots of flavour
all you need is my morning goodness</i>

41:20.522 --> 41:23.889
<i>to get going to school.
It's a trick, not real food.</i>

41:24.023 --> 41:27.455
- <i>Silly Dino. There's no tricks in school.</i>
- <i>Aw.</i>

41:29.089 --> 41:32.123
<i>When that little girl died
we all reacted differently.</i>

41:32.689 --> 41:36.155
<i>Rez seemed to blame everybody else
for trying to kill himself.</i>

41:36.289 --> 41:38.522
<i>He wasn't coping.</i>

41:39.822 --> 41:42.589
<i>The air felt like it was closing in.</i>

41:43.656 --> 41:46.555
<i>I was just glad Kearney wasn't around.</i>

42:05.989 --> 42:11.056
What are you still doing here?
You're boring me now.

42:12.222 --> 42:15.956
What, you want me to babysit you, huh?
Waaaaa!

42:17.188 --> 42:20.522
Come back when you have
something interesting to say.

42:21.088 --> 42:24.489
You know, do something
and show me you're a real man.

42:24.622 --> 42:27.088
Then I'll entertain you again.

42:39.856 --> 42:42.322
- Hey!
- Hey.

42:42.455 --> 42:44.355
- You all right?
- Yeah.

42:44.489 --> 42:46.923
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

42:49.422 --> 42:51.689
So, do you want to get high
and play video games?

42:56.023 --> 42:57.956
Fuck!

43:01.255 --> 43:04.356
- How was America?
- I didn't want to leave.

43:05.023 --> 43:09.356
Man, you've got to see it.
Girls everywhere, man, begging for sex.

43:09.522 --> 43:11.522
Did you get your end away at all?

43:12.656 --> 43:15.023
You end up hooking up with Jen?

43:15.589 --> 43:19.989
You did. Oh, man, I bet she was great.

43:20.122 --> 43:22.522
- Did you ride her?
- Stop asking.

43:23.022 --> 43:26.222
Yeah, OK, she's, er... Yeah, she's hot.

43:26.356 --> 43:28.489
Yeah, yeah, we hooked up.

43:29.856 --> 43:34.989
Er... Listen, Kearney,
something's happened to Rez.

43:35.689 --> 43:38.489
Yeah, I heard about that.
He really meant it?

43:38.622 --> 43:41.255
- Seems like he did. He told me.
- Jesus Christ!

43:41.390 --> 43:44.856
He must feel like a real failure.
Couldn't even kill himself properly.

43:46.589 --> 43:51.188
Jesus! Do you have any idea
what you're talking about, why he did it

43:51.323 --> 43:56.356
Course I do. Rez is far too into himself
he can't deal with the real world.

43:56.489 --> 44:00.656
- Why haven't you seen him yet?
- Because I'm buzzing, Matthew. All right?

44:01.622 --> 44:03.789
I'll go and see him! Fuck me.

44:03.923 --> 44:06.889
Joe! Come here!

44:07.022 --> 44:11.522
Look, my da is the exact same.
Total wanker.

44:12.290 --> 44:14.122
Have a go yourself.

44:21.122 --> 44:24.555
Joseph!

44:35.455 --> 44:41.822
<i>It was intense.
Like being aware of breathing.</i>

44:41.955 --> 44:44.155
<i>Just makes you appreciate being alive.</i>

44:48.822 --> 44:51.689
<i>Look at this motherfucker!</i>

44:51.822 --> 44:54.923
- <i>I'm back, man!</i>
- <i>Oh, not you again?</i>

44:58.055 --> 45:01.889
- <i>Agh. Ugh.</i>
- <i>You like that?</i>

45:15.155 --> 45:16.988
<i>Get off of me! Stop...</i>

45:23.290 --> 45:25.856
Having a sneaky peek, are we?

45:26.656 --> 45:28.922
No, no. I was just, er... Sorry.

45:30.722 --> 45:35.155
Told you. American girls -
mad for some cock!

45:35.290 --> 45:37.555
Yeah.

45:40.722 --> 45:44.290
- Can you keep a secret, Matthew?
- Yeah. Yeah, OK.

45:44.422 --> 45:48.756
- Yeah. Just stop being weird.
- I killed someone.

45:49.988 --> 45:52.789
No, seriously.
I killed someone in America.

45:56.656 --> 46:00.155
- Who? That guy on the tape?
- Yeah.

46:00.656 --> 46:05.422
He was a right prick. I didn't film that
bit, though, which is a bit of a shame.

46:05.555 --> 46:11.888
Course you didn't film that bit, Kearney
I'm not in the mood for fucking stories.

46:13.022 --> 46:16.189
No, you're right. I didn't kill him.
He's fine, actually.

46:17.156 --> 46:20.356
I wanted to, though. You know what I mean.

46:20.855 --> 46:22.855
Since we saw that little girl die,

46:22.988 --> 46:26.022
you said it yourself, it was...
it was powerful.

46:27.955 --> 46:29.722
Are you fucking being serious?

46:29.855 --> 46:32.356
I'm just trying to explain myself, OK?

46:33.122 --> 46:36.422
Look, I haven't got anyone else
I can talk to about this kind of thing.

46:36.555 --> 46:39.589
All right? You're my best mate.

46:40.722 --> 46:43.323
OK, just come into town with me tomorrow

46:43.455 --> 46:46.323
- I want to show you something.
- What?

46:46.455 --> 46:49.789
A real experience. Trust me.

46:53.622 --> 46:54.988
Yeah. Sure.

46:55.123 --> 46:58.290
Grand.

46:58.422 --> 47:01.555
- <i>Welcome back!</i>
- I got these in America.

47:01.689 --> 47:07.189
<i>Let's put our contestants to the test...
examine their deepest fears.</i>

47:07.323 --> 47:09.589
Oxy. Try it.

47:09.722 --> 47:11.955
It'll chill you right out.

47:14.656 --> 47:16.323
<i>I'm not sure about this.</i>

47:16.455 --> 47:18.156
<i>No! No!</i>

47:18.290 --> 47:20.855
<i>No, please stop! Please!</i>

47:20.988 --> 47:23.223
Oh, man, I fucking love this guy.

47:23.356 --> 47:27.489
<i>We do not accept fear.</i>

47:42.356 --> 47:44.022
Ssh.

47:51.788 --> 47:54.722
Walk. Ready? Come on.

48:05.489 --> 48:07.722
You seem a little out of it.

48:07.855 --> 48:11.056
Yeah. Kearney gave me some oxy.

48:11.189 --> 48:14.656
- I thought he was in America.
- Not any more.

48:16.290 --> 48:17.955
How is he?

48:18.089 --> 48:20.089
Still hyper aggressive?

48:20.223 --> 48:23.489
Nah. It's just Kearney.

48:24.821 --> 48:28.656
Some people just... don't get him.

48:30.356 --> 48:32.356
- I do.
- Sure.

48:35.522 --> 48:36.721
Oh!

48:38.422 --> 48:41.721
- Are you sure it's the right time?
- Yeah, Jen, you look so beautiful.

48:41.855 --> 48:44.622
- Don't give me a line.
- I'm not giving you a line.

48:46.555 --> 48:49.422
<i>Girls love it hard.</i>

48:50.955 --> 48:55.922
<i>Come on, do it! Go on, give it to her.</i>

48:59.455 --> 49:00.888
<i>Ah!</i>

49:05.089 --> 49:07.023
<i>She just wants your dick, man.</i>

49:07.156 --> 49:09.323
Hey. It's OK.

49:10.323 --> 49:14.522
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Matthew.

49:14.656 --> 49:16.688
I know you better than anybody.

49:16.821 --> 49:19.489
- <i>Go on, do it.</i>
- Be in the moment with me...

49:19.622 --> 49:21.821
- Don't do that.
- What?

49:21.955 --> 49:24.056
- I want to be with you.
- Stop making me feel weak!

49:24.189 --> 49:27.721
- All this "be in the moment" stuff!
- OK.

49:28.688 --> 49:30.989
I won't be nice, then.

49:32.455 --> 49:35.922
I like you, Matthew. You're sensitive.

49:36.056 --> 49:37.788
It's nice.

49:38.489 --> 49:40.555
Another time.

49:42.956 --> 49:44.023
Yeah.

49:45.356 --> 49:49.256
OK, I'll be here
when you want to come back to me.

49:49.390 --> 49:54.989
Take your time, but...
don't put your shit on me. It's boring.

50:19.888 --> 50:21.956
What was it like?

50:24.755 --> 50:28.189
- You really want to know?
- Yeah.

50:33.323 --> 50:35.721
I've been... seeing things clearly.

50:37.156 --> 50:39.489
You know, too clearly.

50:39.621 --> 50:44.855
Seeing the reasons behind things,
but... didn't feel anything.

50:46.390 --> 50:52.989
When that girl died, I felt even less,
like nothing even at all. Just...

50:54.422 --> 50:55.989
No sadness.

50:57.189 --> 51:00.956
No pain. Just blank.

51:02.956 --> 51:06.189
I wanted to die cos I was fucking ashamed.

51:07.156 --> 51:08.788
Rez, man.

51:19.189 --> 51:20.989
I could do it for you.

51:23.554 --> 51:25.489
If you want.

51:26.189 --> 51:28.422
Right now.

51:32.056 --> 51:35.189
I could get the pillow,
put it over your head.

51:36.489 --> 51:42.755
End it all for you...
if you really wanted to die.

51:50.554 --> 51:52.455
I'm only messing.

51:53.822 --> 51:56.856
Rez, you're one of me only mates.
I don't want you to die.

51:57.923 --> 51:59.755
Yeah.

51:59.889 --> 52:03.989
- Of course.
- Look, um... There's this party.

52:04.123 --> 52:07.156
I think it's gonna be big.
I think you should come.

52:07.290 --> 52:09.521
Man, I only got out of the hospital
the other day...

52:09.655 --> 52:12.856
You're out now. There's no point
sitting round here on your Toblerone.

52:12.989 --> 52:16.156
I'm sure I'd want to kill myself
if I was in that situation.

52:16.290 --> 52:20.621
Look, come to the party.
It's gonna be a rager.

52:21.688 --> 52:24.554
I'm glad you're not dead, buddy.

52:32.189 --> 52:33.889
<i>Asshole!</i>

52:39.755 --> 52:42.256
- Where are we going?
- I got a plan.

52:42.390 --> 52:45.356
Listen, if you think it's getting
out of hand, just say and I'll stop.

52:45.488 --> 52:49.056
- But Jesus, man, the buzz!
- Just fucking tell me where...

52:49.189 --> 52:51.056
Wait, watch.

53:02.422 --> 53:04.521
Hello, there. Hello.

53:05.089 --> 53:08.889
Hello. Need some change, man?
You look like you need a hand.

53:10.756 --> 53:14.123
- Kearney, man. Let's just go.
- Why?

53:14.256 --> 53:15.889
I get it, right? You're crazy.

53:16.023 --> 53:18.923
- Let's just fucking leave him alone.
- I'm not crazy.

53:19.056 --> 53:21.588
What's your name, pal? What's your name?

53:21.721 --> 53:24.488
What's your fucking name? I'm Joseph.

53:24.621 --> 53:27.323
- This is Matthew.
- Andy. Andy's my name.

53:27.454 --> 53:31.023
- Good to meet you, man. Bad day?
- Ha-ha.

53:33.356 --> 53:34.756
Bad life.

53:36.356 --> 53:38.856
You got any spare change for a hostel?

53:38.989 --> 53:43.056
I... I don't, no. I'm afraid not.
I wish I could help you, man.

53:43.189 --> 53:45.056
I really do.

53:45.189 --> 53:47.956
- What about you, pal? Any spare change?
- No.

53:48.089 --> 53:50.756
- A little bit of food?
- We don't have any change, man.

53:50.889 --> 53:53.923
- I'm sorry.
- I've got something else for you, though.

53:54.056 --> 53:57.621
I found this in my brother's room and
I don't want him messing around with it.

53:57.756 --> 54:01.123
I reckon you like this shit,
so do you want it?

54:02.756 --> 54:06.056
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

54:06.889 --> 54:09.356
I don't want your brother to have it.
I can take it off you.

54:09.488 --> 54:12.789
You sure?
Well, it's up to my mate Matthew.

54:12.923 --> 54:15.123
- For fuck's sake!
- Just give it to him.

54:15.256 --> 54:18.123
- Come on, lad.
- Unless you want it yourself.

54:19.256 --> 54:22.789
Give us the gear, man.
Give us the fucking gear.

54:22.923 --> 54:25.156
<i>Give us the fucking gear!</i>

54:26.189 --> 54:27.989
<i>There we go.</i>

54:28.123 --> 54:32.488
<i>Cheers, cheers, cheers.
Lads, you are good heads.</i>

54:33.123 --> 54:36.789
<i>May it never be said
that you didn't keep Andy fed.</i>

54:37.323 --> 54:39.822
Yeah. Have fun with that.

54:39.956 --> 54:42.956
Fucking hell! How'd you feel?
How'd you feel?

54:43.089 --> 54:45.521
- <i>Grand.</i>
- <i>Yeah? Just grand?</i>

54:45.656 --> 54:48.689
<i>I know you're fucking messing.
What was in the bag? Sugar?</i>

54:49.856 --> 54:54.189
What do you think was in the bag, Matthew?
Smack? Gear?

54:54.323 --> 54:57.621
Fuck load of rat poison?

54:57.756 --> 55:00.189
He fucking took it! He fucking took it!

55:01.089 --> 55:03.521
- Are you serious, right?
- Yeah.

55:03.656 --> 55:07.822
- <i>Are you fucking serious?</i>
- Why? What?

55:08.488 --> 55:12.256
Fuck, man! I didn't know you were going
to give him fucking poison.

55:12.389 --> 55:14.123
- Me?
- Yeah, you!

55:14.256 --> 55:17.322
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You made this decision
You knew what you were doing.

55:17.454 --> 55:19.189
- What?
- You denying it now?

55:19.322 --> 55:21.023
- Yeah, I am denying it!
- Why?

55:21.156 --> 55:24.588
Because I didn't know that you were going
to give him fucking poison, man!

55:24.722 --> 55:27.722
I thought you were fucking joking, man!

55:27.856 --> 55:30.488
Are you fucking serious right now?

55:31.156 --> 55:34.554
- Fuck, man! Where is he?
- Matthew, Matthew.

55:34.689 --> 55:37.123
- Calm down. Relax.
- Relax?

55:37.256 --> 55:39.189
I'm only joking, all right?

55:39.589 --> 55:41.389
It was sugar, that's all. Relax.

55:41.521 --> 55:43.289
For fuck's sake, Kearney, man!

55:43.421 --> 55:46.488
Why the fuck would you go round
saying shit like that?

55:46.622 --> 55:48.756
For the buzz.

55:49.722 --> 55:51.956
For the fucking buzz!

55:52.656 --> 55:54.822
For the fucking buzz?

55:55.889 --> 55:57.023
Fuck!

56:33.255 --> 56:37.089
- Don't bang the fucking door!
- Oh, fuck off!

56:37.223 --> 56:41.089
- What did you say to me?
- I said fuck off!

56:42.421 --> 56:46.089
- You should have stayed in America.
- Would you have cared if I had?

56:47.089 --> 56:51.089
- Would you have cared if I had?
- No! Now will you give it a fucking rest?

56:54.622 --> 56:58.555
Yeah, your mam used to do the same.

57:02.289 --> 57:03.989
I knew you didn't have it in you.

57:11.255 --> 57:14.956
Yeah. Your face is softer
than I thought it would be.

57:51.123 --> 57:52.622
Perks of having a job.

57:52.756 --> 57:56.522
People always know where to find you
when you're not answering your phone.

57:56.656 --> 57:59.656
- Matthew, have I done something wrong?
- No.

57:59.789 --> 58:02.023
I can't talk. I have to work.

58:02.822 --> 58:04.522
Well, I'm in no rush.

58:04.656 --> 58:07.789
I'll wait until you decide you want
to be a man and talk about it.

58:07.923 --> 58:11.489
- Just fuck off!
- Is this about the drugs the other nigh

58:11.622 --> 58:14.489
Seriously, we can talk about it.
It's not that big a problem.

58:14.622 --> 58:16.421
I know it's not a fucking problem, Jen!

58:16.555 --> 58:19.923
Shit has been happening to me
and I'm trying to fucking handle it!

58:20.056 --> 58:21.589
Oh, yeah.

58:21.722 --> 58:24.856
What have you been handling that allows
you to behave like a complete prick?

58:25.555 --> 58:29.622
You're right, Matthew...
shit place to work.

59:37.956 --> 59:39.390
All right?

59:39.522 --> 59:41.923
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

59:43.555 --> 59:48.889
- All right, Rez. Out of hospital, then?
- No, I'm a fucking hologram, man.

59:49.023 --> 59:52.023
Look, I thought it was good
for Rez to get out, OK?

59:52.155 --> 59:56.422
It's gonna be some night -
the three boys back together!

59:56.722 --> 59:58.756
The amigos!

1:00:09.222 --> 1:00:11.188
Look... Cheers.

1:00:12.088 --> 1:00:14.055
Go on, put 'em up.

1:00:14.188 --> 1:00:15.555
To Rez.

1:00:20.589 --> 1:00:22.989
So, er, is Jen gonna be there tonight?

1:00:23.555 --> 1:00:25.422
Yeah, I guess.

1:00:26.356 --> 1:00:29.122
Cool. Good. Grand.

1:00:30.822 --> 1:00:33.489
I got some more of that oxy,
if you want some.

1:00:33.622 --> 1:00:35.656
Mixes real good with beers.

1:00:36.022 --> 1:00:38.789
Yeah, yeah. Fuck it. Sounds good.

1:00:42.555 --> 1:00:45.122
Not for you, fucking suicide watch!

1:00:46.188 --> 1:00:48.323
I'm joking, Jesus!

1:00:59.323 --> 1:01:01.455
Whoa, cool!

1:01:27.756 --> 1:01:29.789
This is all right this, isn't it?

1:01:36.789 --> 1:01:38.923
All right, lads? Nuts?

1:01:39.055 --> 1:01:40.822
Fine. Excuse me.

1:01:46.489 --> 1:01:50.055
Matthew! Matthew!

1:02:01.689 --> 1:02:04.656
I only heard. Nobody told me.

1:02:05.922 --> 1:02:09.622
- You're an idiot.
- Yeah, I know.

1:02:15.356 --> 1:02:17.088
Come on! Sit down!

1:02:18.955 --> 1:02:20.122
Oh!

1:02:20.256 --> 1:02:22.689
- Cleaning that oxy up?
- Mixes wicked with coke.

1:02:22.822 --> 1:02:25.555
Come on! Do the whole thing!

1:02:26.455 --> 1:02:29.088
- Yeah, there we go.
- And the oxy.

1:02:51.189 --> 1:02:53.455
Jen.

1:02:59.722 --> 1:03:01.922
Give me a minute? Thank you.

1:03:04.122 --> 1:03:07.622
- You all right?
- Yeah. I didn't think I'd see you here.

1:03:07.756 --> 1:03:09.390
Yeah, Kearney brought us.

1:03:09.522 --> 1:03:13.955
Mm. Always a good idea for your creepy
friend to bring you to a party.

1:03:18.855 --> 1:03:20.622
- Cool.
- Jen, Jen, Jen...

1:03:20.756 --> 1:03:22.390
- What?
- Come and sit here.

1:03:22.522 --> 1:03:25.055
No. Don't you have something to say to me?

1:03:27.256 --> 1:03:30.156
I'm sorry, right,
for losing my shit the other day.

1:03:31.789 --> 1:03:33.555
I thought I was OK with it.

1:03:33.689 --> 1:03:35.656
But I guess I'm not.

1:03:36.356 --> 1:03:38.422
Maybe I'm just...

1:03:41.223 --> 1:03:47.390
Sometimes, right, you look at life, yeah
and you just need somebody to direct you.

1:03:47.522 --> 1:03:49.689
Or you can take responsibility.

1:03:49.821 --> 1:03:52.722
And by the way,
is this your version of an apology?

1:03:55.455 --> 1:03:57.555
- Jen.
- Yes.

1:03:58.922 --> 1:04:00.922
I'm really fucking sorry.

1:04:03.422 --> 1:04:05.022
I'm sorry.

1:04:06.888 --> 1:04:07.888
OK.

1:04:12.622 --> 1:04:15.988
Er... Are we still, like, you know...?

1:04:17.489 --> 1:04:19.522
Well, you're gonna have to ask me again.

1:04:20.089 --> 1:04:24.788
But not tonight.
Tonight... I'm getting drunk.

1:04:26.189 --> 1:04:28.189
See ya later.

1:04:35.589 --> 1:04:38.056
Let's do it. Come on!

1:04:38.189 --> 1:04:40.689
One for you. One for you.

1:04:52.689 --> 1:04:55.189
- No, please no!
- Yeah!

1:04:55.323 --> 1:04:58.390
Jen! Jen!

1:04:58.522 --> 1:05:00.955
Come on, Jen! Fucking do it!

1:05:01.089 --> 1:05:03.123
Come on!

1:05:03.256 --> 1:05:06.955
Jen! Jen! Jen! Jen!

1:05:08.589 --> 1:05:10.821
Come on! Next one!

1:05:12.189 --> 1:05:13.922
Do it! Jen!

1:05:14.056 --> 1:05:16.189
Jen! Jen!

1:05:24.522 --> 1:05:26.955
- Kearney.
- What's up, man?

1:05:28.223 --> 1:05:30.089
Was it poison?

1:05:30.223 --> 1:05:33.888
Listen, Matthew, ask me no questions,
I'll tell you no lies.

1:05:34.023 --> 1:05:34.955
Right?

1:05:35.089 --> 1:05:37.922
Anyway, that guy was a fucking prick!

1:05:38.056 --> 1:05:41.189
Who cares? Don't let it bother you, man.

1:05:47.522 --> 1:05:53.189
Jen, come on. Have another one,
you and me. I know you like it!

1:05:54.888 --> 1:05:58.821
Matthew, do you want to find
some place quiet?

1:06:00.156 --> 1:06:01.821
- Jen.
- Yeah?

1:06:02.622 --> 1:06:07.156
Do you remember that homeless guy?
Remember ages ago we gave him some money?

1:06:07.290 --> 1:06:10.622
- You really liked him, man, didn't you?
- Don't talk about other guys.

1:06:10.755 --> 1:06:13.655
Come on. I don't like anybody else.

1:06:14.821 --> 1:06:16.555
I'll be back in a minute, all right?

1:06:16.688 --> 1:06:18.522
- What?
- I'll be back in a minute.

1:06:19.290 --> 1:06:20.855
Fine.

1:06:23.489 --> 1:06:25.522
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1:07:07.256 --> 1:07:09.923
Take it easy.
Sit yourself there, that's it.

1:07:12.522 --> 1:07:14.821
You OK?

1:07:15.956 --> 1:07:17.889
You OK?

1:07:18.356 --> 1:07:20.189
Sit up.

1:07:20.323 --> 1:07:21.989
Mm? Matthew.

1:07:23.390 --> 1:07:25.755
Yeah. Yeah, it's Matthew.

1:07:26.655 --> 1:07:29.189
Yeah, it's fine.

1:07:32.889 --> 1:07:34.023
Jen?

1:07:39.290 --> 1:07:42.455
Anyone seen Jen? Have you seen Jen?
Anyone seen Jen?

1:07:46.821 --> 1:07:47.821
Jen?

1:08:23.290 --> 1:08:25.422
Lay down.

1:09:06.356 --> 1:09:08.554
Mm, what?

1:09:26.956 --> 1:09:30.023
It's OK. It's OK. Jen. It's fine, Jen.

1:09:30.156 --> 1:09:33.454
- Jen, it's all right.
- Stop! Stop!

1:09:33.588 --> 1:09:35.588
Fuck! Fuck off, Kearney!

1:09:35.721 --> 1:09:38.789
- Get off! No!
- Jen, Jen, Jen.

1:09:39.256 --> 1:09:43.422
- Kearney, what the fuck?
- It's OK. Just fooling around.

1:09:43.789 --> 1:09:46.721
Jen, we were just fooling around.
You kissed me first.

1:09:46.856 --> 1:09:48.655
No. No.

1:09:48.789 --> 1:09:50.956
Jen, it's OK to want to fuck.

1:09:51.089 --> 1:09:54.655
Don't be... Don't be ashamed. It's fine.

1:09:55.688 --> 1:09:57.756
Get off me!

1:09:57.889 --> 1:10:01.056
I know what you're doing. I know.

1:10:01.189 --> 1:10:04.056
Jen, I can't believe
you'd think that of me.

1:10:05.454 --> 1:10:06.923
Come on.

1:10:07.056 --> 1:10:10.722
- Jen, I care about you.
- You don't care about anybody.

1:10:13.189 --> 1:10:14.454
Well, that's not true.

1:10:14.588 --> 1:10:16.123
Go away.

1:10:17.156 --> 1:10:18.156
Go away!

1:10:28.856 --> 1:10:30.189
Fine.

1:10:30.323 --> 1:10:33.822
Fine. Have it your way.

1:12:01.521 --> 1:12:05.856
<i>Let me guess,
it only happened cos you were drunk.</i>

1:12:07.023 --> 1:12:09.189
- What?
- No, no. Come on.

1:12:09.322 --> 1:12:11.156
I really want to hear this.

1:12:12.656 --> 1:12:14.989
Matthew, I... I zoned out.

1:12:15.123 --> 1:12:20.156
Then you realised that you
FUCKED MY BEST FRIEND!

1:12:21.256 --> 1:12:22.589
Is that what he told you?

1:12:22.722 --> 1:12:25.622
He didn't need to tell me.
I fucking saw you!

1:12:27.421 --> 1:12:29.256
- You fucking saw?
- Yeah.

1:12:29.656 --> 1:12:35.554
Yeah, I fucking saw. I saw you, I saw
Kearney on the bed kissing, about to fuck.

1:12:35.989 --> 1:12:38.521
No, don't worry. I didn't stay to watch.

1:12:38.656 --> 1:12:40.822
And you didn't fucking do anything?

1:12:40.956 --> 1:12:43.722
He was trying to rape me
and you did nothing?

1:12:46.956 --> 1:12:50.756
- What?
- Yeah. What?

1:12:54.622 --> 1:12:57.756
No, no, no. You were drunk, right?

1:12:58.421 --> 1:13:00.822
I thought I fucking saw you
kissing him back.

1:13:00.956 --> 1:13:03.856
Matthew, was I really?
Kearney, of all people?

1:13:03.989 --> 1:13:06.255
I was drunk and your friend
was trying to rape me.

1:13:06.389 --> 1:13:09.789
But I was having a great time,
I was really enjoying it

1:13:10.289 --> 1:13:15.089
I didn't fucking know, Jen.
Did he...?

1:13:15.223 --> 1:13:16.923
Fuck you!

1:13:17.056 --> 1:13:18.656
No.

1:13:20.454 --> 1:13:22.089
Oh, fuck.

1:13:24.856 --> 1:13:27.023
FUCK! I'm gonna fucking kill him!

1:13:27.156 --> 1:13:28.889
- I'm gonna fucking kill him!
- Really?

1:13:29.023 --> 1:13:31.555
That's your response?
You self-important little prick!

1:13:32.255 --> 1:13:34.956
You gonna beat him up
so you feel better about yourself?

1:13:35.089 --> 1:13:37.454
That's great, Matthew,
that's really great

1:13:37.589 --> 1:13:40.156
You knew what he was like, I told you.

1:13:41.589 --> 1:13:43.589
I didn't think he'd fucking do that.

1:13:44.156 --> 1:13:47.289
- I'm gonna fucking kill him.
- Wrong answer.

1:13:47.421 --> 1:13:50.389
- You need me to.
- What?

1:13:51.089 --> 1:13:54.488
No, you want to.
I don't need you to protect me, OK?

1:13:54.622 --> 1:13:58.789
I can fight my own battles, but take
responsibility for who your friends are.

1:14:00.023 --> 1:14:02.722
I needed you to care then, Matthew.

1:14:04.188 --> 1:14:05.856
I needed you.

1:14:07.023 --> 1:14:08.756
Not now.

1:14:18.789 --> 1:14:22.156
Kearney!
Kearney! Kearney!

1:14:32.989 --> 1:14:38.123
So, why is it that it's so hard
to make a woman orgasm, huh?

1:14:38.589 --> 1:14:40.622
Who cares?

1:14:40.756 --> 1:14:45.056
When I asked my da where my mum was,
he turned around to me and he said...

1:14:45.188 --> 1:14:46.455
"Who?"

1:14:49.656 --> 1:14:54.589
When it comes to women, there are always
plenty more fish in the sea, as they say.

1:14:54.722 --> 1:14:57.555
They're swimming around,
they're all there, you know.

1:14:57.689 --> 1:14:59.689
One doesn't mean nothing.

1:15:03.756 --> 1:15:05.822
But what about one death?

1:15:07.422 --> 1:15:09.622
I mean, it also means nothing.

1:15:09.756 --> 1:15:12.622
But it's not about death, is it, Matthew

1:15:13.889 --> 1:15:17.555
There's more to it than that.
It's about power.

1:15:17.689 --> 1:15:21.455
Power over everybody!

1:15:22.155 --> 1:15:23.923
Boo!

1:15:25.389 --> 1:15:30.622
The people don't like this. You're losing
'em. You gotta keep 'em happy.

1:15:31.956 --> 1:15:34.889
Maybe you should just fucking stop, son.

1:15:35.522 --> 1:15:37.589
SHUT UP!

1:15:38.722 --> 1:15:41.656
This is my fucking world!

1:15:42.489 --> 1:15:47.489
But you can't create me
and then just press the pause button.

1:15:48.222 --> 1:15:52.555
Everywhere I look, everywhere,
there's aggression.

1:15:53.689 --> 1:15:55.989
You're never fucking happy.

1:15:56.422 --> 1:15:59.222
And you, Matthew, you most of all.

1:15:59.355 --> 1:16:02.056
You need me, but you're afraid of me.

1:16:02.889 --> 1:16:05.289
"You're a loser, Kearney."

1:16:05.422 --> 1:16:07.856
"But you're also a fucking legend!"

1:16:08.689 --> 1:16:11.356
"You're too aggressive, Kearney."

1:16:12.122 --> 1:16:17.122
Tell me what you fucking want
and I'll tell you what I know, Matthew.

1:16:19.822 --> 1:16:22.356
You can't be pissed off about Jen,
Matthew.

1:16:22.489 --> 1:16:26.789
OK? She's just a girl.

1:16:27.222 --> 1:16:29.756
We need each other.

1:16:32.555 --> 1:16:35.055
Yeah!

1:16:41.422 --> 1:16:43.889
Thank you very much.

1:16:55.222 --> 1:17:00.889
<i>Aren't these two lovebirds
cute? Star-crossed is the term.</i>

1:17:01.022 --> 1:17:08.589
<i>Jen, according to Joseph, you two have
somewhat of an intimate relationship.</i>

1:17:09.555 --> 1:17:17.088
<i>What's gonna happen next?
♪ Because tonight you look so beautiful ♪</i>

1:17:17.390 --> 1:17:20.088
Matthew, you tell me straight.

1:17:20.222 --> 1:17:22.489
What's going on with you?

1:17:25.822 --> 1:17:31.188
Matthew James Joseph Connolly.

1:17:31.323 --> 1:17:33.622
What is fucking going on with you?

1:17:36.122 --> 1:17:38.390
I didn't do anything.

1:17:39.122 --> 1:17:45.022
That's the problem.
But I'm gonna fix it.

1:17:47.055 --> 1:17:48.522
Fix what?

1:17:50.555 --> 1:17:54.822
Matthew... just tell me.

1:18:47.856 --> 1:18:49.722
How's it going, Matthew?

1:18:51.555 --> 1:18:54.155
- Is everything OK with you?
- Yeah.

1:18:54.290 --> 1:18:56.955
- Yeah, fine.
- Good.

1:18:58.088 --> 1:18:59.455
Ah, here's our man.

1:18:59.589 --> 1:19:03.223
- And how is young Prince Hamlet?
- I'm alive and I love life.

1:19:03.356 --> 1:19:04.955
You're grand.

1:19:05.088 --> 1:19:09.223
Well, lads, final big blowout
of the summer.

1:19:09.922 --> 1:19:14.622
- God is in his church!
- Elvis has left the building.

1:19:14.756 --> 1:19:16.822
Why are we in this place?
It's such a dump.

1:19:16.955 --> 1:19:20.223
Well, it just reminds us
of our times together, eh, Matthew?

1:19:20.356 --> 1:19:22.155
Yeah. Fuck, yeah.

1:20:07.323 --> 1:20:09.323
Look at this, lads.

1:20:33.156 --> 1:20:34.988
Some arse out there.

1:20:35.123 --> 1:20:39.722
Later on when the drinks are hot, they a
gonna be gamey as fuck, I'm telling ya.

1:20:39.855 --> 1:20:41.888
I'm gonna find myself some drugs.

1:21:11.223 --> 1:21:13.256
Let's go and dance.

1:21:39.888 --> 1:21:41.922
You got something you want to say,
Connolly?

1:21:42.056 --> 1:21:44.721
Yeah, I want to talk to you about Jen.

1:21:44.855 --> 1:21:49.888
Oh, Jen. How is she?
She got so annoyed at the party, huh?

1:21:50.522 --> 1:21:53.922
Nah. Nah, you don't want
to talk about Jen.

1:21:54.056 --> 1:21:56.888
You want to talk about that junkie
that you murdered, don't you?

1:21:57.023 --> 1:21:59.788
- That's not what I want to talk about.
- Don't you remember?

1:21:59.922 --> 1:22:01.755
The day that we went into town?

1:22:01.888 --> 1:22:03.888
We saw that junkie
that you fucking killed.

1:22:04.023 --> 1:22:06.356
- Shut the fuck up.
- You gave him heroin.

1:22:06.489 --> 1:22:08.123
- With rat poison in.
- Shut up!

1:22:08.256 --> 1:22:12.223
Why, Matthew? You want everybody
to find out you're a fucking murderer?

1:22:12.356 --> 1:22:14.821
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- I did not kill him!

1:22:14.955 --> 1:22:17.989
- I got you on camera doing it!
- I didn't kill him.

1:22:18.123 --> 1:22:20.888
- Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out!
- Calm down.

1:22:21.023 --> 1:22:24.323
Don't fuck with me! Don't fuck with me!

1:22:24.455 --> 1:22:26.390
Don't fuck with me!

1:22:26.522 --> 1:22:28.788
Stop! Stop! Fucking stop!

1:22:28.922 --> 1:22:31.323
- Get the fuck off! Fuck off!
- OK.

1:22:31.455 --> 1:22:36.455
Yeah. OK.
Jesus, I didn't think you had that in you.

1:22:38.290 --> 1:22:43.555
Look, don't worry about what we did, OK?
It was a weird thing to do, fair enough.

1:22:44.156 --> 1:22:46.455
But I don't regret it
and I know you don't either.

1:22:46.589 --> 1:22:49.356
Kearney, the party.

1:22:49.489 --> 1:22:51.123
Why?

1:22:51.256 --> 1:22:55.555
You and Jen!
You did something, didn't you?

1:22:56.156 --> 1:23:02.156
Well, come on, admit it to me, cos I nee
to hear you say it to my fucking face!

1:23:02.290 --> 1:23:07.555
I want to hear you say,
"I fucking tried to rape Jen!"

1:23:07.688 --> 1:23:09.721
Fucking say it!

1:23:13.755 --> 1:23:17.023
Matthew, you're fucking kidding me.
Did she say that to you?

1:23:17.156 --> 1:23:18.755
Oh, fuck off!

1:23:18.888 --> 1:23:21.390
You think that I tried to rape Jen?
Is that it?

1:23:21.522 --> 1:23:24.755
If it makes you feel any better,
she was the one that came on to me.

1:23:24.888 --> 1:23:27.489
- You're a fucking liar!
- No, Matthew. She's the liar!

1:23:27.621 --> 1:23:31.989
She's the fucking liar!
All girls are the same.

1:23:32.455 --> 1:23:35.256
All of them. You can't trust them!

1:23:35.821 --> 1:23:39.522
And look, I am sorry.
I am really, really sorry.

1:23:39.655 --> 1:23:45.089
OK? Because you... You're my best mate
in the whole fucking world.

1:23:45.589 --> 1:23:47.290
I haven't got anyone else.

1:23:47.422 --> 1:23:51.821
I would do anything for you, Matthew,
anything. I would die for you, man.

1:23:55.688 --> 1:23:58.555
Come on, Matthew, shake my hand.

1:24:00.189 --> 1:24:01.621
Matthew, please!

1:24:07.256 --> 1:24:09.223
Oh, Matthew. Come here, man.

1:24:09.356 --> 1:24:11.455
I fucking love you.

1:24:12.223 --> 1:24:13.923
Fucking love you, man.

1:25:06.290 --> 1:25:07.521
Rez? Rez?

1:25:16.023 --> 1:25:17.655
Amen!

1:28:22.223 --> 1:28:24.023
Oh.

1:28:26.588 --> 1:28:28.822
You're never gonna forget this moment.

1:28:29.554 --> 1:28:32.689
I fucking hate you, Kearney!

1:28:35.290 --> 1:28:37.421
Best mates.

1:29:06.156 --> 1:29:10.689
So, Matthew,
how do you feel?

1:29:19.089 --> 1:29:21.023
Well...

1:29:21.923 --> 1:29:24.956
..if you can't tell us how you feel...

1:29:27.454 --> 1:29:29.488
..shall we let the audience decide?

1:29:34.289 --> 1:29:36.089
Guilty!

1:29:36.223 --> 1:29:37.923
Guilty!

1:29:49.656 --> 1:29:51.889
We will judge you.

1:30:05.488 --> 1:30:07.923
Matthew, what happened?

1:30:11.421 --> 1:30:13.454
I don't know.

1:30:21.522 --> 1:30:24.089
Jen...

1:30:24.222 --> 1:30:25.722
I'm sorry.

1:30:29.322 --> 1:30:30.689
For everything.

1:30:33.555 --> 1:30:35.722
I was wrong.

1:30:40.056 --> 1:30:41.522
Are you OK?

1:30:42.421 --> 1:30:46.322
I'm fine, Matthew. You know that.

1:30:47.589 --> 1:30:51.789
I'm going to go travelling
for a little while. I leave next week.

1:30:53.023 --> 1:30:55.889
I think it's better
if I'm just not here for a bit, you know

1:31:25.023 --> 1:31:30.656
I'm sorry...
about your car and everything.

1:31:32.656 --> 1:31:35.188
You're defined by what you do, Matthew.

1:31:36.289 --> 1:31:38.522
You make your choices.

1:31:51.722 --> 1:31:54.089
Let's get in there.

1:32:12.756 --> 1:32:15.522
<i>People say a lot of things.</i>

1:32:17.289 --> 1:32:20.889
<i>But it's up to you to decide
what's right or wrong.</i>

1:32:21.622 --> 1:32:23.789
<i>Only you.</i>

1:32:27.822 --> 1:32:30.689
<i>That summer may have changed everything.</i>

1:32:37.188 --> 1:32:40.756
<i>But I know what really happened
and what was the right thing to do.</i>
