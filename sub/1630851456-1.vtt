is a psychiatric curiosity,

Is it a hoax? Has he been faking it?

in one of the university parking areas

06:14.720 --> 06:17.680
and was approached by the individual.

06:19.680 --> 06:25.080
Usually, victims in that circumstance
try and listen to their, uh, kidnapper

06:25.160 --> 06:29.120
and avoid doing anything
that might cause their death.

happened by the medical center,

07:06.400 --> 07:09.680
which was quite a ways away
from where we were,

07:09.760 --> 07:12.520

a false sense of security

07:12.600 --> 07:14.760

that this could happen
anywhere, anytime to anyone.

07:22.200 --> 07:26.720
The fourth victim was
an office worker here, downtown Columbus.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.800
He did not take her anywhere.

he persuaded that he needed a ride.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.040
Often, the physical description you get

09:10.120 --> 09:13.360
is close and as honest
as it can possibly be,

09:13.440 --> 09:16.640
but because of the emotion,
you know, that's involved,

09:16.720 --> 09:18.760
there are variations from time to time.

09:19.480 --> 09:22.280

09:25.200 --> 09:27.720

were able to take the police

09:34.400 --> 09:36.720

whose fingerprint was on file with them.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.680
think of the evidence that was available.

a previous criminal experience

10:10.440 --> 10:12.240
where fingerprints were taken,

10:12.320 --> 10:15.760
there was a record of,

with the Columbus Police Department,

10:31.360 --> 10:33.800

done time in Ohio prison,

and he actually had done some time
in the Ohio Youth Commission,

"Look out for the bomb."

11:39.840 --> 11:41.080

So, we called the fire department
to ensure that there was nothing there,

and, obviously, it was a housing area

11:47.600 --> 11:50.520
and there were other people,
so we don't want anything to happen.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.280
Then the fire department responded.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.840
No device was found.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.760
Nothing… nothing that was explosive.

11:56.520 --> 12:00.360
They said the bomb was a fake bomb,
which was pretty simple,

12:03.200 --> 12:04.720

It seemed like he was fairly submissive
and it was not, like, a difficult arrest.

People felt that it went very quickly
and they were grateful,

that some people were a little suspicious,

14:38.960 --> 14:42.640
The reaction in the community, I think,
was shock more than anything else.

14:42.720 --> 14:45.640
Something that happened
in their little town…

14:46.040 --> 14:48.560
and things like that didn't happen.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.280
I was in utter shock

14:51.840 --> 14:55.080
because I knew Billy Milligan growing up

14:55.160 --> 14:57.880
and I knew he was not
capable of any of this.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.480
I knew in my heart
that they had to be wrong.

15:10.560 --> 15:13.680
[woman 9] I think
my brother is in trouble,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.760
but I didn't…
I didn't know what to do.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.760
I was a kid, you know,
I was just a young adult.

15:25.840 --> 15:28.480
I had no idea how to deal with it.

15:30.440 --> 15:34.680
The arraignment was, like,
really soon after the arrest.

15:35.320 --> 15:39.160
So, I went to the arraignment
and they brought him in

15:39.240 --> 15:44.400
and he was just so messed up.

15:44.480 --> 15:50.080
He was just that, "I don't have a clue
about what's going on here."

15:50.960 --> 15:52.880
You could see it in his face.

15:52.960 --> 15:57.440
He was absolutely clueless
about what was happening.

16:05.720 --> 16:09.440
Under Ohio law,
nobody can be prosecuted for a felony

16:09.520 --> 16:12.000
unless they're indicted by the grand jury.

16:12.080 --> 16:15.040
And the grand jury is a body of people.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.440
They meet in secret,

16:16.520 --> 16:19.720
and their job is to determine
whether or not there's enough evidence

16:19.800 --> 16:21.040
to charge somebody.

16:21.120 --> 16:23.320
[typewriter clicking]

16:28.840 --> 16:31.400
When a defendant is charged by indictment,

16:31.480 --> 16:35.320
he will either retain a lawyer
or lawyers will be appointed for him.

16:35.880 --> 16:38.960
In this case,
I believe he was found indigent,

16:39.040 --> 16:40.520
which means he had no money,

16:40.600 --> 16:44.240
and by law he was
entitled to representation.

16:44.320 --> 16:45.680
[static buzzing]

16:47.120 --> 16:49.160
Judy Stevenson and Gary Schweickart

16:49.240 --> 16:52.200
were the public defenders
assigned to his case.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.640
Judy Stevenson and Gary Schweickart

16:57.720 --> 16:59.920
were two of the best attorneys
I've ever met.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.240
Not only their compassion
and their intelligence,

17:03.320 --> 17:05.040
they were so well respected.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.760
[Lewis Williams]
Gary was a very unique individual.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.120
He had a knowledge

17:13.200 --> 17:16.600
of how you could look at your case

17:17.040 --> 17:20.560
and how you could find something in it,

17:20.640 --> 17:23.000
no matter how difficult it appears.

17:23.560 --> 17:28.640
He would find something
and he could turn that case around

17:28.720 --> 17:31.440
to where he could talk a jury

17:31.520 --> 17:35.320
into accepting that his client
was not guilty,

17:35.400 --> 17:37.080
no matter what it looked like.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.920
And Judy, uh, we did call her "Sweet Judy"

17:41.000 --> 17:44.360
because one thing that she could do

17:44.440 --> 17:48.200
was go talk to a judge,
and before you know it,

17:48.280 --> 17:50.400
her client's on probation.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.920
He's not going to prison.

17:52.720 --> 17:55.120
She was very low-key but very effective.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.600
She… and she had a great presence.

17:57.680 --> 18:03.160
She was an attractive woman
who was very effective in front of jurors.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.760
Together they made a very good team.

18:06.720 --> 18:09.240
Everyone knew
that when they said something

18:09.320 --> 18:11.520
that it could be trusted
and taken to the bank.

18:12.120 --> 18:16.560
Gary then went over to the jail,
met Billy, I think, for the first time,

18:16.640 --> 18:19.040
and advised him
not to answer any questions

18:19.120 --> 18:22.520
because he expected some police
to be down there and try to question him.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.840
And as a good
criminal defense lawyer, he told him,

18:24.920 --> 18:27.480
"Don't talk to the people,
don't waive your rights."

18:27.560 --> 18:30.480
[Preston] He was extraordinarily confused.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.320
He had no idea what he had done

18:32.400 --> 18:35.160
and doesn't understand what's going on,

18:35.240 --> 18:37.440
doesn't know from day to day
what's happening.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.680
Gary went over and talked to him

18:40.440 --> 18:43.400
and became convinced
that there was something there.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.520
[Schmerbeck] Judy and Gary
spent a lot of time with Billy.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.080
They didn't understand
what was happening,

18:49.160 --> 18:51.600
but they knew that
they had seen something odd.

18:52.200 --> 18:55.200
They were dealing with a person
that was not typical.

19:08.360 --> 19:13.560
I was then an employee of
Southwest Community Mental Health Center

19:13.640 --> 19:16.560
in the forensic psychiatry department

19:16.640 --> 19:20.680
and we were a group
that did competency evaluations

19:20.760 --> 19:24.960
and sanity evaluations
for the criminal court.

19:25.600 --> 19:31.840
We also were called upon if there
was an emergency down at the jail.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.960
So, we did get a call from the jail

19:42.040 --> 19:43.840
and the call involved

19:43.920 --> 19:47.920
Billy having pulled a urinal,
I believe it was,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.240
off of the wall of his cell,

19:50.320 --> 19:55.800
using the porcelain slivers
to try and slash his wrists.

19:57.920 --> 19:58.920
[sighs]

20:01.040 --> 20:04.000
[voice breaking] And he was so scared.

20:04.680 --> 20:07.400
It was like this little boy was cross…

20:08.000 --> 20:11.360
across the screen from me.

20:13.120 --> 20:19.640
And he said, "I don't know why they're
saying I've done all these things."

20:24.840 --> 20:27.920
Judy and Gary told me and taught me

20:28.000 --> 20:32.800
that you remain open
to all possibilities on a criminal case,

20:32.880 --> 20:35.880
that no two are the same,
even if it's the same charge.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.400
You have different defendants

20:37.480 --> 20:39.520
with different backgrounds
and experiences.

20:39.600 --> 20:42.720
And most cases in criminal court,
they're not black and white.

20:42.800 --> 20:45.200
There's a big gray area

20:45.280 --> 20:50.800
where people's experiences
and abilities come into play.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.600
[country instrumental playing]

21:06.400 --> 21:11.000
[Porter] Whenever he had
pencil and paper available, he would draw.

21:13.360 --> 21:19.080
All of the drawings that he made
when he was in the Franklin County Jail

21:19.160 --> 21:21.400
were different in subject matter

21:21.480 --> 21:23.680
and very different in skill levels.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.240
Some of his artwork
started coming out… [laughs]

21:26.320 --> 21:28.800
…with the rag doll.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.560
Hanging rag doll.

21:30.640 --> 21:33.400
Because no one understood what is that.

21:35.040 --> 21:41.520
That alerted the public defenders
that this person is likely to be suicidal

21:41.600 --> 21:43.840
and doesn't understand what's going on.

21:47.440 --> 21:50.640
And that's when I think
they were starting to try to figure out

21:50.720 --> 21:55.560
this person may not be capable
to participate in his own defense.

21:58.600 --> 22:03.360
To be competent to stand trial,
you had to meet certain criteria.

22:03.440 --> 22:07.920
And one was you had
to understand the nature of the crime.

22:08.600 --> 22:13.040
You had to understand
the difference between right and wrong,

22:13.640 --> 22:18.120
and you had to be able
to cooperate with your attorney

22:18.200 --> 22:20.960
in the preparation of your own defense.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.000
[police car siren wailing]

22:31.880 --> 22:33.840
It was assigned to a particular judge.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.000
In this case,
it was assigned to Judge Flowers.

22:36.720 --> 22:40.200
He was the judge who
basically would handle the case.

22:42.160 --> 22:45.040
He was strict
in the way he ran a courtroom,

22:45.120 --> 22:47.040
but he wasn't unduly strict.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.080
I had a great admiration
for Judge Flowers.

22:49.160 --> 22:52.560
He would enforce the rules of evidence,
the rules of procedure,

22:52.640 --> 22:54.480
but he would let you try your case.

22:54.560 --> 22:57.200
And he treated everybody,
whether… whoever you were,

22:57.280 --> 23:01.080
whether you were a prosecution witness
or defendant witness,

23:01.160 --> 23:02.720
he would treat you fairly.

23:03.600 --> 23:06.480
And they were able to talk Judge Flowers,
Judge Jay Flowers,

23:07.000 --> 23:10.360
uh, into having
a psychological evaluation done of him,

23:10.840 --> 23:13.560
and Dorothy Turner
was the forensic psychologist

23:13.640 --> 23:14.960
from Southwest Mental Health

23:15.040 --> 23:16.920
that went over to see Billy.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.200
Spent considerable time with him.

23:21.080 --> 23:24.400
So, she went down and talked to him

23:24.480 --> 23:27.160
and Dorothy Turner came back

23:27.640 --> 23:31.160
and was very puzzled by what she had seen,

23:31.240 --> 23:34.840
and went back
several more times to talk with him.

23:36.560 --> 23:40.960
I believe she attempted
to give him a Rorschach test,

23:41.040 --> 23:42.920
which she was an expert in,

23:43.000 --> 23:47.640
and found the results
to be so disjointed and so confusing

23:48.320 --> 23:51.360
that it rendered it unusable.

23:54.640 --> 23:58.680
He went through, um, several tests,

23:58.760 --> 24:01.200
physical and psychological tests

24:01.280 --> 24:06.960
that revealed significant differences
in his IQ on any given day.

24:07.040 --> 24:10.400
And the results went from

24:10.960 --> 24:14.600
absolute borderline
intellectual functioning

24:14.680 --> 24:18.800
that was almost at a level
of what was then called retardation,

24:19.440 --> 24:25.360
all the way up to being
off the charts in terms of genius level.

24:25.440 --> 24:27.440
[static buzzing]

24:30.080 --> 24:34.120
[Rob Baumgardt] One time they had
taken Billy to run some tests on him.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.640
And I think it's called an EEG machine,

24:36.720 --> 24:38.800
that they test the brain waves.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.240
Up until this time, I did not know,
but theoretically, I guess,

24:46.320 --> 24:51.120
there's three different types
of brain waves we have throughout our life

24:51.200 --> 24:53.600
and they change typically by your age.

24:53.680 --> 24:55.440
They'd taken Billy to run some tests

24:55.520 --> 25:00.360
and it showed that
the person that was being tested

25:00.440 --> 25:02.960
was much younger than what Billy was.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.680
And that's when they started saying like…

25:06.760 --> 25:09.400
there… either something's
wrong with the machine

25:09.480 --> 25:12.960
or this person's brain is doing
different things at different times.

25:23.560 --> 25:26.560
It still bugs me when they call me Billy,
but I don't say much.

25:26.640 --> 25:28.560
I don’t say anything really.

25:29.880 --> 25:31.720
But I’m not Billy.

25:43.440 --> 25:46.720
When Dorothy was finished on that session,

25:46.800 --> 25:48.560
she went over and talked to Judy

25:48.640 --> 25:51.480
and she said,
"You've got to talk to your client."

25:51.560 --> 25:54.200
"There's something really,
seriously wrong here."

25:54.920 --> 25:57.400
Judy and Gary
spent a lot of time with Billy.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.040
And I remember him saying,

25:59.120 --> 26:02.000
"I've never seen anything like this.
I'm not sure I ever will again."

26:02.080 --> 26:03.800
[on tape]
Because believe it or not,

26:03.880 --> 26:07.400
different personalities, um,
had different mannerisms

26:08.000 --> 26:09.520
and they would walk differently.

26:09.600 --> 26:12.600
They would hold themselves
differently when they sat.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.720
Um, some had accents.

26:15.320 --> 26:17.840
Once you understood this somewhat 
and saw him,

26:18.440 --> 26:21.840
you knew after a while
who you were talking to.

26:21.920 --> 26:25.120
There were obvious times of switching

26:25.920 --> 26:28.760
and changing of personalities

26:28.840 --> 26:31.280
in a very dramatic way.

26:31.360 --> 26:36.160
There was nothing subtle
about what happened when it would happen.

26:38.280 --> 26:42.920
When he would switch,
his eyes would roll back in his head

26:43.000 --> 26:47.440
and then he would
show evidence of nystagmus,

26:47.520 --> 26:49.880
the fluttering of the eyes,

26:50.520 --> 26:53.240
and then suddenly you would find yourself

26:53.320 --> 26:56.640
talking with someone
who seemed completely different.

27:00.840 --> 27:03.440
My mother was not at all surprised.

27:03.520 --> 27:05.200
She was not skeptical.

27:05.280 --> 27:09.200
She had always,
even prior to this, made the comment,

27:09.280 --> 27:11.600
"That's not him. There's two Billys."

27:11.680 --> 27:13.880
"There's this Billy
who does all these bad things

27:13.960 --> 27:15.280
and then there's this Billy."

27:15.360 --> 27:16.680
She's always said that.

27:17.200 --> 27:22.680
There was one time, we were
having something going on downstairs

27:22.760 --> 27:25.000
and the other children
were all the way downstairs

27:25.080 --> 27:26.680
in a kind of a party room.

27:28.720 --> 27:32.640
And Billy was here, and then he came up

27:32.720 --> 27:35.440
and he stood behind the table there.

27:38.120 --> 27:41.000
And Billy asked me why I call him Billy.

27:42.480 --> 27:45.360
And I said, "Well, that was the name
I gave you at birth."

27:46.680 --> 27:48.480
Sometimes it gets frustrating

27:49.200 --> 27:51.520
because they gotta
call your name two or three times

27:51.600 --> 27:55.040
and you're not paying any attention
to what they're saying,

27:55.120 --> 27:57.280
and then it's, "Oh, yeah, I'm Billy."

27:58.480 --> 28:02.080
Dorothy Turner said
she thought there was a possibility

28:02.160 --> 28:08.280
that this individual might be
a multiple personality disorder.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.600
[dramatic music playing]

28:24.200 --> 28:26.760
This disorder, multiple personality,

28:26.840 --> 28:30.000
which is also now known as
Dissociative Identity Disorder,

28:30.080 --> 28:34.280
has been around
in modern psychiatry

28:34.360 --> 28:36.120
since the 1800s or earlier.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.360
The best way I can describe it

28:38.440 --> 28:43.280
is to say that we all have
different aspects of our personalities.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.720
And we're pretty familiar with them.

28:45.800 --> 28:48.040
In the case of a multiple,

28:48.840 --> 28:53.360
those aspects have splintered out.

28:54.800 --> 28:58.600
And they've not only
become separate entities,

28:59.400 --> 29:04.440
but they don't necessarily
know about the existence of the others.

29:04.520 --> 29:07.320
So, one of the things
that makes a person with DID

29:07.400 --> 29:09.800
different from most other people

29:09.880 --> 29:12.600
is the discontinuities
that they live with,

29:12.680 --> 29:16.200
that they find themselves places
and they don't remember what they did.

29:16.280 --> 29:20.640
They find that they've done things
and they have no recollection of that.

29:20.720 --> 29:25.240
Whereas most people remember
what they do from place to place to place.

29:25.320 --> 29:28.080
And so, they have a sense
of continuity of existence.

29:28.160 --> 29:31.480
Whereas, the people with DID
often feel like they exist,

29:31.560 --> 29:33.320
and then time goes by

29:33.400 --> 29:35.760
and then suddenly they
find themselves someplace else.

29:35.840 --> 29:39.000
Most people don't understand this disorder

29:39.080 --> 29:42.280
and they think it's
too fantastic to be real.

29:52.560 --> 29:55.160
When Gary Schweickart told me
about these multiple personalities,

29:55.240 --> 29:56.560
I thought it was a joke.

29:56.640 --> 29:59.040
Nobody's more skeptical
than prosecutors, right?

29:59.120 --> 30:01.880
I thought he was desperate,
he was grasping at straws.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.640
Multiple personalities.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.800
Have you ever
seen someone change personalities

30:07.880 --> 30:09.240
right in front of your eyes?

30:09.320 --> 30:11.640
Tonight. Multiple personalities.

30:11.720 --> 30:12.920
[stammering] Jay!

30:13.000 --> 30:14.480
Seventy-six?

30:14.560 --> 30:16.160
Z-H-A-Y. Zhay.

30:16.240 --> 30:21.880
I still to this day have a hard time
understanding multiple personalities.

30:21.960 --> 30:24.080
How our minds can split like that

30:24.160 --> 30:27.320
and we can have
different characters in our mind

30:27.400 --> 30:29.240
and not understand what we're doing

30:29.320 --> 30:31.640
or know what one is doing.

30:31.720 --> 30:35.040
Usually, if someone
has mental health issues,

30:35.120 --> 30:41.120
they also are examined
for a second, uh, part of a defense

30:41.200 --> 30:45.040
and that would be
"not guilty by reason of insanity."

30:45.120 --> 30:49.680
And so, I think Mr. Milligan
raised both competency to stand trial

30:49.960 --> 30:53.480
and the fact he asked for an examination

30:53.560 --> 30:57.240
to determine whether or not
he was not guilty by reason of insanity.

31:00.520 --> 31:02.480
Judge Flowers had appointed

31:02.560 --> 31:05.360
a well-known,
well-respected doctor, George Harding,

31:05.440 --> 31:08.520
who actually was
associated with the Harding Hospital.

31:12.840 --> 31:16.760
Dr. Harding and Harding Hospital
was the premier mental health hospital

31:16.840 --> 31:18.320
here in this county.

31:21.120 --> 31:25.840
[Porter] He was highly respected
in the psychiatric, psychological,

31:25.920 --> 31:27.280
mental health community.

31:29.320 --> 31:32.240
Gary Schweickart had been to see me

31:32.320 --> 31:37.880
and had asked if I would be
interested and willing to, uh,

31:37.960 --> 31:41.640
participate in the evaluation.

31:42.240 --> 31:47.720
Gary said that he felt that he was
showing some symptoms of a mental illness

31:47.800 --> 31:52.960
and I indicated that I
would want to see the patient

31:53.040 --> 31:57.000
and evaluate first
before making a decision,

31:57.080 --> 31:59.160
but that I would be willing to do that.

32:00.280 --> 32:01.800
[Harding] How are you feeling?

32:02.840 --> 32:04.000
I feel nervous.

32:06.920 --> 32:10.120
[Harding]
During the time I was evaluating him,

32:10.200 --> 32:12.680
I, uh, noted

32:12.760 --> 32:18.160
that his behavior, uh, his voice,

32:18.240 --> 32:21.880
his, uh, accent

32:23.360 --> 32:27.520
changed on many occasions.

32:28.160 --> 32:31.240
[with British accent] I presume
that he was under the assumption

32:31.320 --> 32:32.920
he was coming to see a physician,

32:33.000 --> 32:34.240
not a psychiatrist.

32:35.160 --> 32:38.200
[with Yugoslavian accent] She never liked
it before, why should she want it now?

32:41.280 --> 32:43.320
[high-pitched] I just feel so damn guilty.

32:45.120 --> 32:47.920
[flatly] Oh, probably.

32:50.760 --> 32:54.000
In 1978, when I first saw him,

32:54.080 --> 32:56.880
the diagnosis of multiple personality

32:56.960 --> 33:01.280
was not a commonly made diagnosis.

33:01.920 --> 33:04.960
So, it, uh, was something
that I was skeptical about,

33:05.040 --> 33:06.920
and I saw him the first time

33:07.000 --> 33:10.160
with very much of a need
to be shown that this is…

33:10.240 --> 33:12.440
this was really a psychiatric disorder.

33:15.840 --> 33:18.960
Dr. George Harding asked me

33:19.040 --> 33:22.960
if I would please interview Billy Milligan

33:23.040 --> 33:26.000
and tell him if I had any opinions

33:26.080 --> 33:30.640
as to whether or not
he met the legal requirements for insanity

33:30.720 --> 33:33.080
at the time of the alleged offenses.

33:36.520 --> 33:38.640
The first time
I heard about Billy Milligan

33:38.720 --> 33:41.560
was from Dr. George Harding

33:41.640 --> 33:45.880
who wanted to know
if I would be willing, uh,

33:45.960 --> 33:49.800
to be the psychotherapist for Billy.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.480
I have to say, at that point,

33:53.560 --> 33:57.240
I was not a hundred percent convinced

33:57.320 --> 34:00.040
of the correctness of that diagnosis.

34:07.520 --> 34:09.600
I had an open mind,

34:09.680 --> 34:14.080
but I wanted to see what would emerge

34:14.560 --> 34:16.720
in the clinical work.

34:20.320 --> 34:24.200
And, so, there was some question:

34:24.280 --> 34:28.440
Was he attempting to, um… [clicks tongue]

34:28.520 --> 34:32.560
make a case
for the multiple personality diagnosis

34:33.200 --> 34:37.880
in order to, um, have an excuse

34:37.960 --> 34:42.360
or to exculpate himself
from the charges that he faced?

34:43.000 --> 34:45.320
[Milligan] Dr. Harding was very adamant

34:45.400 --> 34:51.400
that if I'm manifesting
some kind of thing to avoid trouble,

34:52.120 --> 34:54.200
that he'd be the first one to…

34:54.280 --> 34:55.280
to nail me.

34:57.240 --> 35:01.440
I think the skepticism
regarding that diagnosis

35:01.520 --> 35:05.960
involved both the medical
and including the psychiatric community,

35:06.040 --> 35:08.880
certainly also the legal community,

35:09.400 --> 35:12.640
and I believe
with the general public also.

35:15.520 --> 35:18.800
The first important growth
of multiple personality disorder

35:18.880 --> 35:20.080
in the 20th century

35:21.080 --> 35:24.800
happened after The Three Faces of Eve
starring Joanne Woodward.

35:24.880 --> 35:26.560
She won an Academy Award.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.680
And its sequel, in effect,
was the book Sybil,

35:31.320 --> 35:33.520
written by an author,

35:33.600 --> 35:37.600
but in collaboration
with a psychoanalyst and a patient.

35:38.240 --> 35:43.960
There is a rare psychological disorder
called multiple personality.

35:44.040 --> 35:46.400
The book and the movie Sybil
were based on one such case.

35:47.400 --> 35:50.880
[on tape] I had no knowledge
of multiple personality

35:50.960 --> 35:52.720
or anything before that.

35:52.800 --> 35:56.960
So, I bought myself a copy of Sybil
and started reading

35:57.080 --> 35:59.960
and, um, learned a lot
by reading the book.

36:00.040 --> 36:02.280
I think Judy Stevenson was the one

36:02.360 --> 36:04.360
who indicated to me what it was.

36:04.880 --> 36:10.320
And there was a, uh,
TV show involving Sally Field,

36:10.840 --> 36:14.600
and she said, "If you don't understand
what this is about

36:14.680 --> 36:18.240
you should watch it to see it
to get an idea what we're talking about."

36:20.160 --> 36:21.000
Sybil?

36:21.720 --> 36:23.600
[Sybil whines]

36:25.840 --> 36:26.920
[whimpers]

36:27.000 --> 36:30.120
People. The… The people…

36:30.200 --> 36:33.160
They're everywhere,
they're… they're… they're everywhere!

36:33.240 --> 36:35.240
[static buzzing]

36:37.920 --> 36:42.800
None of us had ever diagnosed or treated

36:42.880 --> 36:45.920
a multiple personality disorder before.

36:46.320 --> 36:50.320
We felt like we needed confirmation

36:50.400 --> 36:55.160
by someone who was more familiar
with that diagnosis than we were.

36:55.800 --> 36:57.520
We came to Lexington, Kentucky

36:57.600 --> 37:00.120
to talk with a leading expert
on multiple personalities,

37:00.200 --> 37:02.040
Dr. Cornelia Wilbur.

37:02.120 --> 37:05.600
You may remember Dr. Wilbur
from the widely publicized case

37:05.680 --> 37:07.120
of her patient called Sybil.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.120
-[woman 10] Dr. Wilbur.
-[man 10] Cornelia Wilbur.

37:09.200 --> 37:12.080
-[woman 11] Cornelia Wilbur.
-[man 11] She's the doctor for Sybil.

37:12.160 --> 37:15.360
Dr. Cornelia Wilbur,
who is the nationally known psychiatrist

37:15.440 --> 37:17.240
who successfully treated Sybil.

37:17.320 --> 37:19.840
And by successfully treating Sybil,

37:19.920 --> 37:22.480
she was able
to integrate the 16 personalities

37:22.560 --> 37:24.120
into one personality.

37:24.760 --> 37:26.480
We did talk with her

37:26.560 --> 37:31.240
and, uh, she shared with us her experience

37:31.320 --> 37:35.400
treating the one she calls Sybil.

37:37.760 --> 37:41.800
It is so unusual and kind of crazy

37:41.880 --> 37:45.080
to think about someone
having multiple personalities,

37:45.160 --> 37:48.160
that Judy told me
that they allowed the prosecutors

37:48.240 --> 37:49.760
to spend some time with Billy.

37:49.840 --> 37:52.200
[suspenseful music playing]

37:54.320 --> 37:58.640
[Yavitch] On March 12th 1978,
it was a Sunday morning.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.800
We met over at the county jail

38:00.880 --> 38:03.320
and it was myself, Gary Schweickart,

38:03.400 --> 38:06.280
Judy Stevenson, Dr. George Harding

38:06.360 --> 38:08.200
and Dr. Wilbur was there.

38:08.280 --> 38:10.320
The Sheriff's Office was nice enough

38:10.400 --> 38:13.560
to give us their break room
and open it up for us

38:13.640 --> 38:16.280
and, um, they brought Mr. Milligan in.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.280
[Harding] Billy came in and sat down

38:19.360 --> 38:22.720
and we asked a few questions.

38:22.800 --> 38:27.400
It seemed that, uh,
he was driven by feelings

38:27.480 --> 38:31.800
that he did not fully understand.

38:34.440 --> 38:37.160
[on tape] I mean, it was probably
like a couple of seconds of stuff

38:37.240 --> 38:39.360
but then all of a sudden
maybe he'd sit differently

38:39.440 --> 38:40.640
or talk with a British accent.

38:40.720 --> 38:43.600
His body language, his posture, his voice,

38:43.680 --> 38:46.720
everything was just spot-on.

38:47.520 --> 38:50.040
Up until that time,

38:50.120 --> 38:55.360
I thought it was a joke,
uh, a charade, it was…

38:55.440 --> 38:56.320
I didn't know,

38:56.400 --> 39:00.080
but this was so very convincing to me,

39:00.160 --> 39:02.440
and I came away
with the impression

39:02.520 --> 39:04.320
that if it was fake,

39:05.120 --> 39:06.760
it was a very, very good fake.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.680
I couldn't tell that it was.

39:09.240 --> 39:11.240
[static buzzing]

39:25.560 --> 39:27.520
Well, it wasn't, uh, something

39:27.600 --> 39:30.240
that was your run-of-the-mill
psychiatric problem.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.720
But we felt that here was a problem,

39:32.800 --> 39:35.480
it was something
that needed to be understood better,

39:35.560 --> 39:38.320
and we felt that, uh,
we had a responsibility

39:38.400 --> 39:40.880
to take the tough cases
as well as the easy ones.

39:41.920 --> 39:44.720
So to speak, he had to give an opinion,

39:44.800 --> 39:47.360
but according to Ohio law

39:47.440 --> 39:52.800
and the way that
psychiatrists and psychologists testified,

39:52.880 --> 39:58.840
Dr. Harding could not say
he was legally insane

39:58.920 --> 40:01.040
or he was not legally insane.

40:01.120 --> 40:04.520
He was asked to determine whether or not

40:04.600 --> 40:07.560
Billy at the time of the offenses

40:08.200 --> 40:10.200
knew right from wrong

40:10.280 --> 40:14.360
and then Dr. Harding
would so report that to the court.

40:14.440 --> 40:18.000
And the court would decide
whether or not to conclude

40:18.080 --> 40:21.440
that he was legally insane
at the time of the offenses.

40:21.520 --> 40:25.320
And so, Dr. Harding
agreed to take him as a patient

40:25.400 --> 40:30.560
and do the psychiatric evaluations,
um, for a period of, like, three months.

40:31.120 --> 40:34.560
Going to Harding Hospital
to be restored to competency

40:34.640 --> 40:36.480
was not normal.

40:37.080 --> 40:41.720
Normally, if people were
to be restored to competency,

40:41.800 --> 40:43.120
they were sent to Lima,

40:43.800 --> 40:46.400
Lima State Hospital
For the Criminally Insane.

40:46.480 --> 40:49.440
But it was felt that Harding

40:49.520 --> 40:53.000
was a safer environment for him.

40:53.080 --> 40:56.520
I think it was Gary and Judy
who were able to say,

40:56.600 --> 40:57.880
"We need to have this guy…"

40:57.960 --> 41:01.160
"We need to have our client here
and not clear up in Lima."

41:01.240 --> 41:05.960
And because it was known
as the hell hole here in Ohio.

41:06.040 --> 41:07.400
It was a horrible place.

41:14.120 --> 41:17.440
Evaluating the symptoms
that were presented

41:17.920 --> 41:20.400
made us feel that
it would be worthwhile

41:20.480 --> 41:23.160
to do a thorough evaluation.

41:23.240 --> 41:29.920
So, Dr. Wilbur came to the hospital
and, uh, evaluated Billy Milligan.

41:33.960 --> 41:35.400
Who am I talking to?

41:36.360 --> 41:37.360
-Danny.
-Oh.

41:38.080 --> 41:39.240
How old are you?

41:39.320 --> 41:40.480
-Fourteen.
-Mm-hmm.

41:40.560 --> 41:42.120
Who is around most of the time?

41:43.520 --> 41:44.840
Allen and Tommy.

41:45.560 --> 41:46.760
How old is Allen?

41:47.600 --> 41:48.920
-Eighteen.
-Mm-hmm.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.120
-And how old is Tommy?
-Sixteen

41:51.200 --> 41:53.960
Nobody had the sense
to ask the three questions:

41:54.880 --> 41:56.440
Has anybody ever told you

41:56.520 --> 41:58.760
that you did something
you didn't remember doing?

41:59.720 --> 42:03.960
Have you ever found yourself someplace
and didn't know how you got there?

42:05.120 --> 42:07.320
And have you ever been aware of the fact

42:07.400 --> 42:10.520
that the clock hands
seemed to have gone around

42:10.600 --> 42:12.960
and you didn't know what happened
during that period of time?

42:13.040 --> 42:16.120
[interviewer] Bill Milligan's answers
to those questions were all…

42:16.720 --> 42:17.600
Yes.

42:17.680 --> 42:21.080
I felt like she knew what she was doing

42:21.160 --> 42:27.560
and I felt like she knew
how to confirm the diagnosis

42:27.640 --> 42:30.720
that we were looking to get confirmed.

42:32.040 --> 42:34.240
[interviewer] How soon
did you know Billy was a multiple?

42:34.480 --> 42:37.080
[Wilbur] Um, oh, I would guess

42:37.160 --> 42:39.160
20 minutes after
the start of the interview,

42:39.240 --> 42:41.560
because by this time I had
talked to three different people

42:41.640 --> 42:43.320
and they had come spontaneously.

42:43.960 --> 42:45.640
But he didn't know.

42:45.720 --> 42:48.840
He didn't know that he was a multiple.

42:48.920 --> 42:50.760
If we're talking about Billy,

42:51.280 --> 42:55.920
the core personality,
did not know that he was a multiple

42:56.000 --> 42:57.320
at that point in time,

42:57.400 --> 43:00.040
and it wasn't easy to reveal at all.

43:01.440 --> 43:02.720
[Harding] You hearing them now?

43:03.320 --> 43:04.400
I can't hear them now.

43:04.480 --> 43:06.920
Well, I can hear and know they’re there.

43:08.160 --> 43:10.280
Is that… is that the people that…

43:11.520 --> 43:13.760
that lady told me was inside me?

43:14.520 --> 43:15.920
[Harding] It could be.

43:16.840 --> 43:18.360
What are they doing in there?

43:19.880 --> 43:22.120
Nobody said why these people are here.

43:27.200 --> 43:29.520
Well, one of the skeptical attitudes

43:29.600 --> 43:33.160
is that the DID doesn't exist
until you get into therapy,

43:33.240 --> 43:35.400
then the therapist
asks a whole bunch of questions

43:35.480 --> 43:37.360
and you go,
"Oh, yes. I have people inside."

43:37.440 --> 43:41.720
[on tape] Well, I think we're a long ways
from really knowing how this works

43:41.800 --> 43:44.360
because it is not under the control
of the individual

43:44.440 --> 43:46.120
or any of the alternates.

43:47.320 --> 43:50.000
By definition, in DID,
there has to be amnesia

43:50.080 --> 43:51.960
and parts that don't know each other.

43:52.040 --> 43:53.680
And when one part comes out,

43:53.760 --> 43:56.000
the other part has no memory
of what happened.

44:10.280 --> 44:13.440
All of the drawings that he made

44:13.520 --> 44:17.760
were different
depending on who was doing the drawing,

44:17.840 --> 44:20.080
which personality was doing the drawing.

44:20.160 --> 44:24.560
And it did help
to understand the different personalities

44:24.640 --> 44:28.400
and what each of those entities was like.

44:40.840 --> 44:45.080
[Harding]
He tended to describe some of the alters.

44:45.440 --> 44:47.840
Some were male, some were female,

44:48.320 --> 44:51.560
some were as young as three or four.

44:52.400 --> 44:55.600
Many were in his age group.

44:56.400 --> 45:02.840
Initially, the person
who was in charge the most was Arthur.

45:03.280 --> 45:09.360
He was the one who dealt
with any situation that seemed safe.

45:10.520 --> 45:13.400
[British accent] When I arrived,
there was quite a bit of confusion.

45:13.960 --> 45:17.080
And Arthur spoke with a British accent,

45:17.800 --> 45:20.440
but he was very unemotional,

45:21.000 --> 45:23.640
and he seemed to be the one

45:23.720 --> 45:27.360
who controlled
which of the other personalities

45:27.440 --> 45:30.120
were allowed to come forward and talk.

45:30.720 --> 45:32.680
I control the spot completely.

45:32.760 --> 45:34.640
I say who is on and who is off.

45:34.720 --> 45:39.920
He took a long time
before he let us meet with Ragen,

45:40.000 --> 45:44.200
who was the personality
that was most angry and most violent.

45:44.280 --> 45:48.760
If you look at "Ragen" it is "Rage Again."

45:48.840 --> 45:53.120
And Ragen was the personality

45:53.200 --> 45:56.280
that spoke in a Yugoslavian accent.

45:56.880 --> 45:59.080
[Yugoslavian accent]
I know how to pay for a crime.

45:59.160 --> 46:00.920
I’ve been in prison before.

46:01.560 --> 46:03.600
[Porter] Tommy was the escape artist.

46:04.280 --> 46:06.400
When he was at Harding Hospital,

46:07.080 --> 46:11.280
he got out of the locked unit he was in

46:11.360 --> 46:13.680
and walked around to the front door,

46:14.160 --> 46:17.880
not because he was trying to escape,
but just to see if he could.

46:17.960 --> 46:21.480
And he could get out of a straitjacket,

46:21.560 --> 46:24.320
he could get out of a door lock…

46:25.520 --> 46:27.600
[Wilbur] You are the Houdini, aren’t you?

46:28.200 --> 46:29.720
[chuckles]

46:29.800 --> 46:32.440
[Wilbur] You're the one that got
out of the straitjacket, aren't you?

46:32.520 --> 46:33.480
Yeah.

46:33.960 --> 46:37.040
Not all of the personalities
were spectacular.

46:37.560 --> 46:40.440
Christene was a frightened little girl

46:41.360 --> 46:44.840
who would hide in the corner
and wouldn't look at you.

46:46.600 --> 46:48.600
[Harding] Through specific personalities

46:48.680 --> 46:54.360
identifiable by tone of voice,
facial expression, body image,

46:54.440 --> 46:59.200
uh, they were ones
that we became knowledgeable about

46:59.280 --> 47:02.000
so that we could identify
with whom we were talking.

47:06.600 --> 47:10.520
I believe it was Dr. Harding
that actually gave us the information of,

47:10.600 --> 47:13.280
"This is what
we think is going on with him."

47:13.360 --> 47:15.640
"We think this is
a multiple personality disorder

47:15.720 --> 47:20.360
and that's why he has
these episodes of amnesia

47:20.440 --> 47:23.200
where he says this
but this has happened."

47:23.280 --> 47:25.160
"And you clearly know what is the truth,

47:25.240 --> 47:27.360
but his reality is that distorted."

47:27.440 --> 47:30.640
"And so, we started to understand,

47:30.720 --> 47:33.040
and then things started falling in place."

47:33.120 --> 47:37.000
Now, I have to admit,
my very first gut reaction was, "What?"

47:37.080 --> 47:38.320
"Are you serious?"

47:39.360 --> 47:42.400
But that was not there very long at all

47:42.480 --> 47:46.480
because just as soon
as they started talking about,

47:46.560 --> 47:48.160
"There's one that's English…

47:49.120 --> 47:51.960
uh, it… it just started to make sense

47:52.040 --> 47:56.760
because I had spent time,
I'd seen this firsthand.

47:56.840 --> 47:59.880
I know this person as Billy,

47:59.960 --> 48:02.040
but I know what they're talking about.

48:03.400 --> 48:06.520
To me, he always
seemed a little different.

48:06.600 --> 48:08.920
A little… a little unusual.

48:09.000 --> 48:13.280
And one of the interesting things
that came about in the early days

48:13.360 --> 48:15.760
of observing my brother

48:16.400 --> 48:20.520
is that he had a knack for accents.

48:20.600 --> 48:22.880
I remember times when we'd be driving

48:22.960 --> 48:26.720
and he would start all of a sudden,
"Oh, I've got to stop for petrol,"

48:26.800 --> 48:28.600
you know, in his British accent, and…

48:28.680 --> 48:31.320
[laughing] I was like,
"We didn't call gas 'petrol.'

48:31.400 --> 48:33.200
We called gas 'gas.'"

48:33.280 --> 48:35.800
You know, I just thought it was just Billy

48:35.880 --> 48:38.720
trying to be funny,
trying to be hilarious, but…

48:39.840 --> 48:41.960
he was just dead serious.

48:42.760 --> 48:45.440
I'm not really sure
where these accents came from

48:45.520 --> 48:48.600
because I don't recall
seeing them on television.

48:48.680 --> 48:50.600
The only other show I remember…

48:50.680 --> 48:54.160
Well, Star Trek came out
in the 60s, the late 60s,

48:54.240 --> 48:56.000
and maybe The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

48:56.080 --> 49:00.360
Those were the only things
I remember him, um, being interested in.

49:00.440 --> 49:01.920
Name is Napoleon Solo.

49:02.440 --> 49:05.200
I'm an enforcement agent
in Section Two here.

49:05.280 --> 49:07.560
That's Operations and Enforcement.

49:08.080 --> 49:09.680
[Russian accent] I am Illya Kuryakin.

49:09.760 --> 49:11.600
I'm also an enforcement agent.

49:11.680 --> 49:12.760
Like my friend Napoleon,

49:12.840 --> 49:15.320
I go and I do whatever I am told to.

49:15.880 --> 49:18.000
Arthur was with me quite frequently.

49:18.640 --> 49:20.480
And then along came Ragen.

49:23.120 --> 49:25.240
And had different…

49:26.320 --> 49:28.280
you know, speaking voices.

49:29.120 --> 49:30.720
Spoke in a foreign language.

49:31.520 --> 49:33.080
I couldn't understand a word.

49:33.640 --> 49:36.720
I had to pretend I had understood,

49:38.040 --> 49:41.000
because there was no way
I could explain to him.

49:42.040 --> 49:44.560
But he was talking to me as his mother,

49:44.640 --> 49:47.280
and he thought
I was supposed to understand this.

49:47.800 --> 49:51.320
[Milligan]
In the state that I was in, I thought--

49:51.400 --> 49:53.840
I felt everyone in the world was like me.

49:54.720 --> 49:56.080
On many incidences,

49:56.160 --> 49:59.920
because the way people's moods
would change in front of me,

50:00.800 --> 50:03.640
it would be to me
as they went to sleep

50:03.720 --> 50:05.360
and somebody else had came.

50:06.560 --> 50:09.760
Billy was 14 when he was first sent

50:09.840 --> 50:13.440
to, um, the very first
psychiatric hospital.

50:13.520 --> 50:15.560
Billy was having some problems

50:16.080 --> 50:19.040
and that the doctors want to examine him

50:19.120 --> 50:21.400
and check out and see how he's doing

50:21.480 --> 50:23.080
and give him some tests.

50:25.880 --> 50:29.720
The first doctor that I recall
said that his, um…

50:29.800 --> 50:32.600
that he had states of amnesia.

50:38.280 --> 50:40.960
And then maybe they'd call me from school.

50:41.040 --> 50:43.640
I would go get him, I'd bring him home

50:43.720 --> 50:46.280
and I'd say, "How about going in,
lay down and rest?"

50:47.320 --> 50:48.520
He would go in there.

50:48.600 --> 50:49.880
When he would awake…

50:51.320 --> 50:54.160
then he was completely bewildered.

50:54.640 --> 50:59.880
He didn't know how
he got from the school to his bed

50:59.960 --> 51:02.000
and what he was doing home.

51:06.320 --> 51:07.840
[Milligan] I was in a classroom,

51:08.360 --> 51:12.840
and all of a sudden, I went to sleep

51:12.920 --> 51:16.040
and I woke up on top of a fire escape.

51:16.680 --> 51:17.800
On top of a building.

51:17.880 --> 51:19.760
And my mother had found me up there.

51:20.480 --> 51:21.880
Billy's asleep.

51:22.960 --> 51:25.360
[Harding]
What was it that made him go to sleep?

51:25.440 --> 51:29.480
We had talked to a variety
of these other personalities,

51:29.560 --> 51:34.600
but Billy had not been
allowed to "wake up," as they say.

51:35.480 --> 51:39.800
We put him to sleep
during a suicide attempt

51:39.880 --> 51:41.160
at the age of 16.

51:41.240 --> 51:45.440
The host personality
being gone for five years is not common,

51:45.520 --> 51:46.840
but it's also not rare.

51:47.480 --> 51:49.280
I've seen many cases like that.

51:49.360 --> 51:52.800
And if you just think about this
as a survival strategy,

51:52.880 --> 51:55.360
let's say that
he would have killed himself,

51:55.920 --> 51:57.600
but because he was put inside,

51:57.680 --> 51:58.880
the body didn't die.

52:00.760 --> 52:03.600
It's a defense mechanism,
a coping strategy,

52:03.680 --> 52:05.000
a survival strategy.

52:05.480 --> 52:09.000
But it's basically, "This is too much.
I can't deal with all this."

52:09.080 --> 52:10.760
"I have to break it into pieces

52:10.840 --> 52:13.000
so I don't feel
and know the whole picture."

52:13.600 --> 52:17.000
Now, what about the suicidal business?
Has he been…

52:17.080 --> 52:18.040
No.

52:18.120 --> 52:19.560
So, he’s not suicidal now.

52:19.640 --> 52:20.480
No. Um…

52:21.400 --> 52:23.720
I’d like to see what does he feel like.

52:23.800 --> 52:28.000
I talked as persuasively as possible
with the alternates

52:28.080 --> 52:29.560
and said, "Let Billy come out,"

52:29.640 --> 52:31.480
because they said
they'd been keeping him asleep

52:31.560 --> 52:33.720
because every time he came to,
he'd want to kill himself,

52:33.800 --> 52:35.200
and they didn't want to die.

52:35.720 --> 52:39.320
And I said, "Well, you know,
there are a lot of people here and…

52:39.400 --> 52:43.680
Let him come out,
so at least I can see what he's like."

52:43.760 --> 52:46.160
Are you scared? What's wrong?

52:46.240 --> 52:47.520
[table rattles]

52:47.640 --> 52:48.920
You remember me?

52:49.000 --> 52:50.200
Billy?

52:51.160 --> 52:54.080
You remember me? No need to be scared.

52:54.160 --> 52:55.640
It’s perfectly safe.

52:59.480 --> 53:01.960
[Milligan]
To me, I guess sleep was like death

53:02.040 --> 53:03.520
because it was an escape.

53:04.600 --> 53:09.640
And when Dr. Wilbur woke me up,
it scared me to death

53:10.520 --> 53:13.880
because I had no idea
where I was, what was going on.

53:13.960 --> 53:16.440
And I just seen
all these people around me.

53:18.560 --> 53:20.320
I saw my first miracle.

53:22.800 --> 53:24.360
I saw my son again.

53:26.400 --> 53:27.640
The core, Billy.

53:29.760 --> 53:33.440
[Wilbur] When did everybody start
knowing about everybody else?

53:34.600 --> 53:36.160
When you came around.

53:36.840 --> 53:39.160
[Preston] I think it was
hard for him to believe it at first,

53:39.280 --> 53:44.560
but after explaining the fact
that he couldn't remember

53:44.640 --> 53:46.360
things that he had done,

53:46.440 --> 53:50.040
then I think he had to
come to the conclusion

53:50.120 --> 53:52.880
that what they were telling him
was correct.

53:57.680 --> 53:59.800
How did I get here in this hospital?

54:00.280 --> 54:06.200
[Harding] Mrs. Turner, Dr. Wilbur felt
that perhaps if you came to the hospital

54:06.280 --> 54:11.480
that you would be able
to learn how to deal with problems,

54:11.560 --> 54:14.040
and deal with frightening experiences

54:14.120 --> 54:15.880
and that you wouldn't go to sleep

54:15.960 --> 54:18.520
and then when you wake up
find something had happened

54:18.600 --> 54:20.080
that got you into trouble.

54:21.200 --> 54:22.800
And you guys can do that?

54:23.600 --> 54:26.200
[Harding] We certainly would
like to try to help you do that.

54:27.200 --> 54:30.320
Would you like us to try
to help you do that?

54:30.800 --> 54:32.880
You mean you'll get
these people out of me?

54:47.000 --> 54:49.840
[Harding] What are the things
that are hardest for you to deal with?

54:51.320 --> 54:53.000
If somebody gonna hurt me.

54:54.080 --> 54:55.560
That makes me go to sleep.

54:56.120 --> 54:57.880
[Harding]
That would make you go to sleep?

54:57.960 --> 55:00.720
In order to escape from that person?

55:00.800 --> 55:01.680
Yeah.

55:03.080 --> 55:05.080
If I go to sleep, I don’t get hurt.

55:05.600 --> 55:11.680
The dissociation defense
is an altered state of consciousness

55:11.760 --> 55:15.560
and it occurs because the individual

55:16.320 --> 55:21.400
is put in a position of terrible trauma

55:21.480 --> 55:26.320
that is unbearable
to think about in the present,

55:26.400 --> 55:28.240
and so they dissociate.

55:28.320 --> 55:31.360
They go into a kind of altered state

55:31.960 --> 55:37.680
to mentally leave the traumatic situation

55:37.760 --> 55:40.040
in which they have found themselves.

55:41.280 --> 55:42.840
Why am I that way?

55:43.520 --> 55:46.600
[Harding] There must have been things
that frightened you terribly

55:46.680 --> 55:48.000
when you were very small.

55:50.040 --> 55:53.200
The development of a multiple personality

55:53.280 --> 55:57.680
was the direct result of extreme trauma.

55:57.760 --> 55:59.760
And when I say extreme trauma,

55:59.840 --> 56:02.920
I'm not just talking about child abuse

56:03.000 --> 56:06.920
in the way that
we normally describe child abuse.

56:07.000 --> 56:11.280
I'm talking about child abuse
that borders on torture.

56:11.360 --> 56:13.560
[dramatic music playing]

56:17.920 --> 56:19.240
Does he know I’m here?

56:19.960 --> 56:21.520
[Harding]
Does he know you’re here?

56:21.600 --> 56:22.440
Yeah.

56:22.520 --> 56:23.680
You’re talking about?
