01:49.142 --> 01:50.507
Hey.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.318
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:43.696 --> 02:46.187
I better get going.

02:47.967 --> 02:50.868
I'll tell you, you're gonna be the
best-looking guy at the dean's dinner.

02:51.037 --> 02:53.870
The only thing missing will be
that best-looking girl on my arm.

02:54.974 --> 02:57.772
Somehow, I don't think it would be
politically healthy for either of us

02:57.944 --> 03:01.072
if you brought a teacher
to your first big task-force soiree.

03:01.247 --> 03:03.545
You're right.
So you'll come to the second one.

03:04.350 --> 03:08.013
Just keep your fingers crossed I get
that grant to finish my documentary.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.954
Then I can kiss
university life goodbye.

03:15.528 --> 03:19.362
I don't like it when you shave so close.
I miss that roughness.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.763
I'll keep that in mind
on the way to the dean's.

03:23.770 --> 03:25.533
I really do wish
I could take you tonight.

03:26.406 --> 03:27.839
Take me now.

03:39.819 --> 03:43.755
Face it, Estelle, the only reason
the students want the library open late

03:43.923 --> 03:45.754
is so they can neck.

03:45.925 --> 03:48.393
- Hey, now.
- Brandon, remember,

03:48.561 --> 03:51.724
there's a non-fraternization rule
at this university.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.868
Come on, Estelle,
we can take a hint.

03:56.035 --> 03:58.230
Bye-bye, ladies. Thank you, dean.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.804
I was beginning to get the feeling
they were zeroing in on me.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.339
It doesn't help
that you came alone.

04:02.508 --> 04:04.533
Listen, didn't my secretary
explain to you

04:04.711 --> 04:06.736
that the invitation
was for you and a guest?

04:06.913 --> 04:09.473
Yeah, she did. It just didn't work out.

04:09.649 --> 04:11.378
Oh, Josh.

04:11.551 --> 04:14.111
- You know Brandon Walsh?
- Yes, we almost became best friends.

04:14.287 --> 04:16.915
- How you doing, Josh?
- Not as good as you.

04:17.089 --> 04:20.617
Well, I'll leave you
two powermongers.

04:22.428 --> 04:25.727
- So, who are you here with?
- Flying solo.

04:25.898 --> 04:27.798
Handsome guy like you.
Who'd have think it?

04:27.967 --> 04:28.991
What's it to you, Josh?

04:29.168 --> 04:32.103
<i>Hey, you're big news
around The Condor.</i>

04:32.705 --> 04:34.172
Gotta hand it to you, Walsh.

04:34.340 --> 04:37.332
I've never seen a freshman
move up the fast track like you.

04:37.510 --> 04:39.102
You're the original boy wonder.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.304
Yeah, well,
like they say, stuff happens.

04:41.481 --> 04:44.746
Right. That's why I'm gonna be doing
the feature story on you myself.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.976
I hope you don't mind,
but I'm gonna be interviewing

04:47.153 --> 04:48.484
some of your teachers and friends.

04:48.655 --> 04:50.623
Just to get a better insight
into the great man.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.418
Yeah, well, you can lay off
the "great man" angle.

04:53.593 --> 04:56.494
I'm just a student
trying to make a little noise, that's all.

04:56.663 --> 04:58.858
That's what you do so well.

04:59.032 --> 05:00.590
What are you after, Richland?

05:00.767 --> 05:04.999
The truth.
No one can be as perfect as you.

05:05.338 --> 05:07.636
Well, see you in the papers.

05:19.285 --> 05:22.049
You don't have to be so nervous.
I'm not gonna snort the cookie dough.

05:22.221 --> 05:24.917
David, I'm not nervous.

05:25.858 --> 05:28.258
Well, maybe just a little.

05:28.428 --> 05:30.259
Yeah, me too.

05:30.430 --> 05:31.522
My shrink says it's normal.

05:31.698 --> 05:34.064
I just have to find activities
to keep my hands busy.

05:35.668 --> 05:38.159
- David.
- No, not that.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.238
I'm talking about renting a piano.

05:41.474 --> 05:44.932
You know, the sound of music
without a pounding drum track

05:45.111 --> 05:47.409
may give the apartment
a peaceful vibe.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.411
Maybe even help us get close again.

05:50.950 --> 05:52.281
Maybe.

05:54.487 --> 05:57.456
You know, no matter what
I said at the time,

05:57.623 --> 05:59.716
it really was lonely
around here without you.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.953
It's been lonely for me too.

06:13.172 --> 06:15.766
- I wonder who that is.
- Probably Brandon.

06:15.942 --> 06:18.638
No, he would've parked
in the driveway.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.275
You don't think Brenda
ordered a pizza, do you?

06:21.447 --> 06:24.746
I hope not.
She just polished off the cheesecake.

06:26.452 --> 06:29.853
Well, it is our esteemed son.
How was the big meeting?

06:30.022 --> 06:31.046
Well, it went pretty well.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.555
Dean Trimble
seemed to like my idea

06:32.725 --> 06:34.955
about upgrading the status
of undergraduate teaching.

06:35.128 --> 06:36.618
Of course he did. It's a great idea.

06:36.796 --> 06:38.957
I guess we're gonna talk more about it
on Saturday night

06:39.132 --> 06:41.123
at Chancellor Arnold's.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.768
Anyway, I'm gonna hit it. Good night.

06:44.303 --> 06:48.000
Brandon, are you going out later?

06:48.174 --> 06:50.108
Out? Why do you ask?

06:50.276 --> 06:52.836
Well, I was wondering why
you didn't park your car in the garage.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.275
I thought I might go over
to Steve's later.

06:56.449 --> 06:58.007
Unwind?

06:58.184 --> 07:00.345
Yeah. Yeah, unwind.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.112
Well, don't stay up too late.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.023
Brandon, what do you think?

07:11.664 --> 07:15.964
Oh, this get-up won't have anything
to do with Stuart Carson, would it?

07:16.135 --> 07:19.070
Well, he invited me to Palm Springs
for the weekend.

07:20.406 --> 07:22.533
You two are picking up
right where you left off, huh?

07:22.708 --> 07:25.302
Why not? After all,
I still have his engagement ring.

07:26.145 --> 07:29.273
Oh, Brandon, relax.
It's just on my right hand.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.077
Besides, Stuart insisted I keep it.

07:32.251 --> 07:34.879
Obviously, he's not ready
to give up on us either.

07:35.054 --> 07:37.113
Well, you could do a lot worse.
Stuart's a good guy.

07:37.824 --> 07:40.224
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.

07:40.393 --> 07:41.883
So how was dinner tonight?

07:42.061 --> 07:44.552
Did you geniuses figure out
how to save Western civilization?

07:44.730 --> 07:47.426
Well, I gotta tell you.
I love being on the task force.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.625
But I had no idea
how political it was gonna be.

07:50.236 --> 07:51.601
Political?

07:51.771 --> 07:55.036
How effective you are seems to be
based on how you're perceived.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.732
It's all about appearances.

07:56.909 --> 07:58.433
If you weren't going away
this weekend,

07:58.611 --> 08:01.409
I'd be taking you
to the chancellor's luncheon.

08:02.014 --> 08:03.276
Why don't you take a date?

08:04.083 --> 08:05.675
Yeah, right. Like who?

08:06.352 --> 08:08.547
Brandon, come on.
I know that you're seeing someone.

08:09.956 --> 08:11.355
You can't fool me. Who is she?

08:12.859 --> 08:18.229
I'll tell you what. If it becomes serious,
you'll be the first to know.

08:24.370 --> 08:25.928
Have you seen Brandon
this morning?

08:26.105 --> 08:27.402
He must have gone to class early.

08:27.573 --> 08:29.905
I stopped by his room,
but he was already gone.

08:30.076 --> 08:32.135
Well, after all that business
with the Peach Pit,

08:32.311 --> 08:35.371
it's good to see him getting focused
on what's important again.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.212
Hello.

08:41.386 --> 08:43.855
Oh, good morning, ma'am.

08:44.023 --> 08:47.322
Could I interest you
in purchasing a vacuum cleaner?

08:48.060 --> 08:49.084
I don't know.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.492
Why don't you come in
and show me how it works?

08:54.867 --> 08:56.334
Excellent suction.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.860
- Hey there, Stuart.
- Mr. Walsh.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.632
- Mrs. Walsh.
- Hi, Stuart.

09:01.807 --> 09:03.604
- How about some breakfast?
- No, thanks, Mom.

09:03.776 --> 09:06.609
Lucinda Nicholson's seminar starts
in 20 minutes, I don't wanna be late.

09:06.779 --> 09:09.407
I cannot believe your daughter
has me hanging out on campus all day

09:09.582 --> 09:11.516
before we head down
to the Springs.

09:11.684 --> 09:13.117
By the way, I talked to your father.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.550
I think he's gonna be more than open
to your presentation.

09:15.721 --> 09:16.813
I hope so.

09:16.989 --> 09:19.355
It's the first major project
I've ever presented to him.

09:20.693 --> 09:23.161
- You ready to go, Bren?
- Yeah, all set.

09:23.329 --> 09:25.126
Have a good time.

09:25.298 --> 09:28.597
- If you decide to get married, call us.
- Oh, now, what fun would that be?

09:33.172 --> 09:35.106
Should we pack now?

09:39.278 --> 09:41.508
Well, if monogamy
is rejected in some cultures,

09:41.681 --> 09:43.774
how do these women
have any power?

09:43.950 --> 09:45.508
That's a good question, Kelly.

09:45.685 --> 09:46.743
They do and they don't.

09:47.153 --> 09:50.247
Among the tribes of Southern Africa
that practice polygamy,

09:50.423 --> 09:52.323
the man will choose several wives.

09:52.491 --> 09:53.856
He'll have a bright wife,

09:54.026 --> 09:56.893
another who cooks,
another who can do errands

09:57.063 --> 09:58.894
but only his bedmate
will be his equal.

09:59.065 --> 10:01.397
Well, does that mean
sex gives women power?

10:01.567 --> 10:03.125
Historically, it's been proven.

10:03.302 --> 10:07.363
For example, the Trojan War,
fought for the love of Helen of Troy.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.440
So you do admit
that love is important?

10:09.609 --> 10:12.009
Sorry, I meant desire.

10:12.178 --> 10:13.509
Not that I don't believe in love.

10:13.679 --> 10:14.737
No, but what you are saying

10:14.914 --> 10:17.815
is that sex is a power
that women shouldn't be ashamed of.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.748
Well put, Kelly.

10:25.825 --> 10:27.486
Maybe I'm in the wrong class.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.924
It's just everything she says
sounds so extreme.

10:30.096 --> 10:31.120
Well, it works for me.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.162
I intend to practice
on Stuart all weekend.

10:33.332 --> 10:35.664
You know what?
I left my anatomy book in her class.

10:35.835 --> 10:37.268
Oh, stay where you are, I'll get it.

10:37.436 --> 10:39.597
There's no way our mother-to-be's
tackling stairs again.

10:39.772 --> 10:41.535
Thanks, Kelly.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.933
Andrea, I've been waiting for you.
Are we all set?

10:45.578 --> 10:48.479
Actually, Steve,
I've been having second thoughts.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.309
- What?
- Donna, come on.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.418
Power women shouldn't
have to watch men whine.

10:54.887 --> 10:57.788
What are you talking about, Andrea?
I'm all set to move in.

10:57.957 --> 10:59.720
Look, I don't know
if your taking over my dorm

10:59.892 --> 11:00.950
is such a good idea, Steve.

11:01.127 --> 11:03.527
You're just getting cold feet, Andrea.

11:03.696 --> 11:06.096
Actually, I don't wanna see
my dorm room turned into a KEG den

11:06.265 --> 11:07.857
for the hormonally challenged, okay?

11:08.034 --> 11:10.366
- There, I said it.
- Andrea, it won't.

11:10.536 --> 11:13.664
With all that's happened this year, I'd
like to think that I learned something.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.032
I'm gonna be on campus
weekends working,

11:16.208 --> 11:17.971
and I need my room
to study once in a while.

11:18.144 --> 11:20.476
It's yours.
Weekends, I'll hang at the KEG house.

11:20.646 --> 11:21.670
And the computer?

11:21.847 --> 11:24.042
I'm still gonna need it
for my research any time.

11:24.216 --> 11:28.175
Come on, Andrea, if I was Brandon,
you wouldn't have a problem with this.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.754
It just so happens
I'm turning very Brandonesque.

11:33.859 --> 11:37.260
Okay. Okay, we will try it.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.855
Thanks, Mom. I'll see you later.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.262
- You won't regret it.
- Yeah.

11:50.276 --> 11:52.335
Excuse me, I just wanted
to get Andrea's book.

11:52.511 --> 11:54.376
No problem.

11:57.416 --> 11:58.440
Is something the matter?

11:58.617 --> 12:02.383
I just can't seem to get a break
from any of the funding agencies.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.852
I guess no one believes in my work.

12:05.991 --> 12:09.518
Well, I do. I think you're brilliant.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.023
Thanks.

12:12.932 --> 12:14.991
I really thought the NEA
would go for my proposal.

12:15.167 --> 12:16.293
The film's halfway finished

12:16.469 --> 12:18.630
and I wasn't even asking
for that much money.

12:18.804 --> 12:20.669
You have a film?

12:21.507 --> 12:24.806
Well, it started out as my thesis,

12:24.977 --> 12:27.445
but I can't help thinking
it can be something more than that.

12:28.914 --> 12:31.678
Do you wanna go get some coffee?
Maybe we could talk?

12:32.852 --> 12:34.581
Yeah, sure.

12:35.855 --> 12:37.413
Anywhere but the cafeteria.

12:38.023 --> 12:39.854
Well, how about
my boyfriend's restaurant?

12:45.898 --> 12:47.092
You know, I hate to admit it,

12:47.266 --> 12:50.531
but this place actually
ran good without me.

12:50.703 --> 12:52.364
Well, Suzanne knows
what she's doing.

12:52.538 --> 12:55.098
It's a good thing because I didn't.

12:55.674 --> 12:57.301
Hey, there's my number one customer.

12:57.476 --> 13:01.139
Could I possibly interest you
in the house special?

13:01.313 --> 13:03.008
I'll take one to go.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.844
Lucinda, this is my boyfriend,
Dylan McKay.

13:06.018 --> 13:07.144
Hi.

13:07.586 --> 13:11.488
The infamous Lucinda Nicholson.
Kelly never stops talking about you.

13:12.091 --> 13:13.319
Can we get some service here?

13:13.492 --> 13:15.756
My best booth. Nat, three coffees.

13:16.929 --> 13:18.021
Seriously, though, Lucinda,

13:18.197 --> 13:20.995
the field work you did
in Guatemala sounds incredible.

13:21.167 --> 13:23.897
What was the name of the tribe
you lived with, the Ixtu?

13:24.069 --> 13:26.264
The Ixtu Paca.

13:26.972 --> 13:29.270
- She filmed them for her thesis.
- Really?

13:29.441 --> 13:31.375
That's part of a documentary
I've been working on.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.876
It compares the roles of women
in different tribal societies

13:34.046 --> 13:35.877
with the role of women
in contemporary America.

13:36.048 --> 13:37.572
That must be some contrast.

13:37.750 --> 13:38.944
Well, not the way you think.

13:39.118 --> 13:42.383
The strange thing is,
it seems the more civilized the society,

13:42.555 --> 13:44.079
the less they seem
to value their women.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.023
- That's a movie I'd like to see.
- So would I.

13:47.193 --> 13:50.060
But she hasn't been able to get
the money to finish the rest of her film.

13:50.863 --> 13:54.526
Yeah, so I just keep writing
grant proposal after grant proposal.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.033
Here we go.

13:57.203 --> 13:58.693
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

13:58.871 --> 14:01.305
- Here we go.
- Nat, you're looking better every day.

14:01.473 --> 14:02.497
Thanks.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.337
I'm thinking about running
the 10K in between shifts.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.446
- If you need anything, let me know.
- Thanks.

14:08.614 --> 14:12.345
You know, Lucinda, I'd like to take
a look at your proposal sometime.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.610
You would? Why?

14:13.786 --> 14:17.415
Well, I've been known
to back a project I believe in.

14:22.127 --> 14:24.857
- Hey, Nat, how's it going?
- Hey, okay.

14:27.099 --> 14:29.033
You gotta tell me one thing.

14:29.201 --> 14:32.329
Who's the babe
sitting with Dylan and Kelly?

14:34.440 --> 14:37.739
Oh, that babe just happens to be
an anthropology teacher.

14:37.910 --> 14:38.934
Isn't that right, Brandon?

14:39.111 --> 14:41.102
Yeah, yeah. I think so.

14:42.214 --> 14:45.149
From the conversation, I thought
she was one of those movie directors.

14:45.317 --> 14:48.650
You know, the kind
that's always looking for financing.

14:48.821 --> 14:50.311
If that's what she's doing with Dylan,

14:50.489 --> 14:52.923
she's certainly found
some deep pockets.

15:02.368 --> 15:05.929
If I had to use one word to sum
him up, I'd have to say decent.

15:06.705 --> 15:09.640
Brandon is the most decent guy
I know.

15:09.808 --> 15:15.110
He's considerate, caring, passionate
about the things he believes in.

15:15.281 --> 15:17.010
He's the best.

15:17.182 --> 15:20.049
It sounds like you have
a little crush on him, Zuckerman.

15:20.219 --> 15:22.847
This baby you're carrying
isn't his by any chance, is it?

15:23.589 --> 15:27.787
Look, if you want dirt on Brandon,
you're gonna have to bring your own.

15:29.662 --> 15:32.096
Just relax. I'm thrilled for him, okay?

15:32.264 --> 15:35.427
If there's one thing
the task force needs, it's talent.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.501
And he's got it.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.968
Not to mention integrity.

15:40.139 --> 15:43.199
You know how to spell integrity,
don't you?

15:46.445 --> 15:49.141
Andrea, you think
you could help with...

15:49.315 --> 15:51.044
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't know you had company.

15:51.216 --> 15:54.913
No, I'm just going.

15:55.521 --> 15:56.818
Thanks for everything, Zuckerman,

15:56.989 --> 15:58.752
you've given me
some really decent hooks.

16:00.092 --> 16:02.686
<i>Josh is doing a big feature
on Brandon for The Condor.</i>

16:02.861 --> 16:04.658
Oh, really? Cool.

16:05.264 --> 16:07.562
Look, I talked to Kathy
about our arrangement.

16:07.733 --> 16:09.496
- Kathy?
- The RA, she's great.

16:09.668 --> 16:11.659
She has no problem with this
as long as you behave.

16:11.837 --> 16:13.031
Then she has no problem, then.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.505
Hey, Richland.

16:17.676 --> 16:20.167
If you wanna know about Brandon,
you should really interview me.

16:20.346 --> 16:22.109
I could tell you tons of stuff
about this guy.

16:22.281 --> 16:24.977
Like that time last semester,
when I got in trouble with a professor.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.640
It was Brandon who saved my butt.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.650
Oh, yeah, which professor?

16:28.821 --> 16:30.220
Randall.

16:30.389 --> 16:32.721
Really? What kind of trouble?

16:32.891 --> 16:35.485
It was this fraternity thing.
There was a whole bunch of hazing.

16:40.899 --> 16:43.367
- "Idaho," that gives me six.
- Oh, what?

16:43.535 --> 16:47.198
What is someone from Idaho
doing in the San Gabriel Valley?

16:47.373 --> 16:50.399
You're not one of those guys
that always has to win, are you?

16:50.576 --> 16:52.908
Hey, when I'm with you,
I am the winner.

16:55.948 --> 16:58.143
"New Mexico," we're even at six.

16:58.317 --> 17:00.717
Stuart, that's not fair.
You did that on purpose.

17:00.886 --> 17:03.616
Yeah, I guess I am one of those guys
who always has to win.

17:03.789 --> 17:05.780
Yeah, well, you probably
get that from your father.

17:07.326 --> 17:08.759
My father.

17:08.926 --> 17:11.054
Boy, I know just what he's gonna say
about my project.

17:11.230 --> 17:14.358
Brazil? Why do we have to go
all the way to Brazil?

17:15.034 --> 17:19.060
- Well, maybe he'll surprise you.
- I doubt it.

17:19.238 --> 17:22.173
After all, his idiot son
came up with the idea, right?

17:23.342 --> 17:28.075
Well, whatever happens, I'm glad
we got to spend this time together.

17:28.247 --> 17:30.078
I am too.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.782
I just hate the idea of going
straight to the hotel

17:33.952 --> 17:36.250
and getting right in the middle of it.

17:36.422 --> 17:39.050
That's why I thought
we would do something special

17:39.224 --> 17:40.248
before we get there.

17:40.959 --> 17:41.983
What did you have in mind?

17:42.161 --> 17:44.186
Well, it so happens that I bought

17:44.363 --> 17:46.593
the most incredible
camping equipment.

17:46.765 --> 17:50.531
Camping?
Stuart, I'm not exactly dressed for it.

17:50.702 --> 17:52.693
Oh, think of how romantic it'll be.

17:52.871 --> 17:55.169
The two of us
in a down sleeping bag.

17:55.340 --> 17:58.434
The desert sky above us
filled with stars.

17:58.877 --> 18:00.640
What do you say?

18:02.281 --> 18:04.272
Is that a yes?

18:04.450 --> 18:05.883
And there goes
"Minnesota" for seven.

18:06.051 --> 18:07.575
Oh, my God.

18:16.462 --> 18:18.123
I can't help you with that, man.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.458
He was just my tutor.
I hardly know him, you understand?

18:20.632 --> 18:21.826
Yeah, I'm trying to.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.194
But what doesn't make sense is

18:23.368 --> 18:27.031
if everything was so cool as you say,
why did Randall refuse to talk to me?

18:27.206 --> 18:28.696
Beats me.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.637
You know Randall
just separated from his wife?

18:30.809 --> 18:33.607
All I know, I got 200 more reps to do
to stay on my therapy program.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.644
All right.
So, what about Brandon's girlfriends?

18:35.814 --> 18:37.145
Does he have any?

18:39.084 --> 18:41.780
Walsh. What a coincidence.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.114
You're wrong again.

18:43.288 --> 18:47.657
He comes in all the time to help.
He cares.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.593
- So, what's the big deal?
- Nothing.

18:49.761 --> 18:52.696
Just Mr. Hardell seems to resent
my asking questions about you.

18:52.865 --> 18:55.493
I would have thought he'd be thrilled.
Steve Sanders was.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.464
Oh, he was? That's good.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.228
Listen, D'Shawn,
don't worry about it.

18:59.404 --> 19:04.205
Josh here is a big-time newsman.
How's your article going?

19:04.376 --> 19:06.469
Could be a lot more interesting
than I thought.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.141
- You have a good one.
- Yeah, you too.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.614
Man, that is one dude
who's got it in for you.

19:13.785 --> 19:15.252
What did he ask you, man?

19:15.420 --> 19:18.583
Well, if you and Lucinda
were planning on meeting here,

19:18.757 --> 19:20.452
you better be a lot more careful, coz.

19:20.626 --> 19:23.060
See, now, there you go
with that imagination of yours again.

19:23.228 --> 19:26.026
For your information,
Lucinda and I are no longer speaking.

19:34.973 --> 19:37.032
When you're cold, you're cold.

19:49.821 --> 19:51.789
I'm glad you could make it.

19:52.257 --> 19:55.784
Why did you want me
to meet you at a piano store?

19:55.961 --> 19:57.724
Well, I was looking
for a second opinion.

19:57.896 --> 20:00.126
I'm thinking of renting one.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.993
David, I don't know anything
about pianos.

20:03.168 --> 20:05.602
But this one seems nice, doesn't it?

20:09.808 --> 20:13.141
I was thinking maybe
I should get back into my music.

20:14.012 --> 20:16.276
But this time, I'll do it for me.

20:16.448 --> 20:18.507
And stop chasing after record deals.

20:19.318 --> 20:22.776
Well, I always thought you were
more talented than you realized.

20:26.191 --> 20:29.820
I think it'd be cool
having a piano in the apartment.

20:32.264 --> 20:36.223
David, you didn't ask me to come here
to talk about pianos, did you?

20:40.672 --> 20:42.606
No, I didn't.

20:44.843 --> 20:48.176
I just wanted you to know
how much I appreciate what you did.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.605
I'm just glad you're getting better.

20:51.750 --> 20:55.277
Well, I know it's my fault
that we're not all still together.

20:55.454 --> 20:56.944
And I wish you would move back.

20:58.790 --> 21:01.554
- David, are you doing this for Donna?
- No.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.558
No, I'm doing it for me.

21:04.796 --> 21:07.060
- David...
- Just think about it, okay?

21:16.408 --> 21:18.968
Ms. Nicholson,
I'm from the educational task force.

21:19.144 --> 21:20.668
Could I speak with you a minute?

21:20.846 --> 21:23.337
Why certainly, Mr. Walsh.
Come in.

21:24.016 --> 21:26.211
Close the door, please.
It's a little drafty in here.

21:26.385 --> 21:28.353
Sure.

21:36.895 --> 21:37.919
Good boy.

21:38.096 --> 21:39.620
I thought you'd like it.

21:40.432 --> 21:44.266
Now, what was Josh Richland
doing with D'Shawn?

21:44.436 --> 21:45.460
What do you think?

21:45.637 --> 21:48.572
Snooping around, trying to find out
whether I have a girlfriend or not.

21:49.908 --> 21:52.240
- Do you?
- I think so.

21:52.411 --> 21:55.676
Only she's much too beautiful
to take outside closed doors.

21:58.850 --> 22:01.182
Well, maybe you should find yourself
a public girlfriend.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.022
A beard to go with your beard.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.691
You're certainly in a chipper mood.

22:09.861 --> 22:12.421
Did you enjoy your lunch
with Dylan and Kelly?

22:12.597 --> 22:13.621
Lmmensely.

22:13.799 --> 22:16.825
It seems like he might be
interested in funding my film.

22:17.569 --> 22:19.730
I thought you had the NEA for that.

22:19.905 --> 22:22.066
No, I don't. They passed.

22:23.308 --> 22:25.139
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

22:26.044 --> 22:27.705
Does Dylan really
have that much money?

22:27.879 --> 22:28.903
And then some.

22:29.381 --> 22:32.009
Who knows, maybe you could
become his newest philanthropy?

22:33.018 --> 22:35.782
Well, one thing's for sure,
his girlfriend Kelly is terrific.

22:35.954 --> 22:38.252
No argument there.

22:38.423 --> 22:39.856
You know, if you
needed someone to go

22:40.025 --> 22:42.550
to the Chancellor's with you
on Saturday, she'd be ideal.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.057
I don't think she'd wanna go.

22:46.231 --> 22:48.791
I'll bet she'd jump at the chance
to hang with the upper echelon.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.004
Unless you're worried
Dylan might not approve.

22:53.171 --> 22:55.537
No, Dylan's pretty open-minded.

22:56.541 --> 22:58.509
Yeah, it might work.

23:00.612 --> 23:03.410
Hey, hey, hey, are you crazy?

23:04.516 --> 23:06.541
Crazy about you.

23:25.871 --> 23:29.170
Are you sure we're far enough
away from civilization?

23:29.341 --> 23:31.809
Well, this is about
as good as it gets.

23:32.444 --> 23:34.639
Come on, the sun's about to set.

23:42.487 --> 23:44.387
This is one of the things
I love about you.

23:44.556 --> 23:45.580
Yeah, what's that?

23:45.757 --> 23:48.920
For all your mansions
and luxury cars and $3000 suits,

23:49.094 --> 23:51.756
you can still enjoy something
as simple as the sunset.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.830
It all depends
on who I'm sharing it with.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.841
I am freezing.
I'm gonna go get my sweater.

24:05.010 --> 24:08.343
- Stay here, I'll keep you warm, hon.
- No, I'll be right back.

24:35.507 --> 24:38.704
- Oh, God.
- What's going on?

24:38.877 --> 24:41.607
I can't believe
I just locked the keys in the car.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.509
You did what?

24:43.682 --> 24:46.276
Oh, God, Stuart, I'm so sorry.

24:46.451 --> 24:48.214
How could you do that?
What were you thinking?

24:48.386 --> 24:51.355
- Someone's gonna steal it?
- It was force of habit.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.750
- My hand's smaller, let me...
- Excuse me.

24:54.926 --> 24:57.053
I know what I'm doing, okay?

24:58.997 --> 25:00.021
Oh, great, it's stuck.

25:00.198 --> 25:01.722
- Here, pull...
- Will you stop?

25:01.900 --> 25:03.891
It's just making it worse.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.500
There. Better?

25:09.674 --> 25:12.268
No, how could it be better?
We're still here, aren't we?

25:15.680 --> 25:16.942
Stuart, I'm sorry.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.615
It was an accident.

25:19.784 --> 25:21.649
Oh, man.

25:21.820 --> 25:24.254
Stuart, why don't I get a rock
and just smash in the window?

25:24.422 --> 25:26.117
You'd like that,
my brand-new Range Rover.

25:26.291 --> 25:29.658
No, Stuart, if we had to be stuck
somewhere, it could be a lot worse.

25:29.828 --> 25:31.728
Look at the stars.
This is pretty incredible.

25:31.897 --> 25:33.364
Maybe we should
just camp out here.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.397
- Yeah, I don't think so, okay?
- Why not?

25:35.567 --> 25:38.400
Because the camping equipment
is locked inside.

25:38.570 --> 25:40.265
- Oh, right.
- Yeah, right.

25:40.438 --> 25:42.065
I'm freezing.
At least you have a sweater.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.640
- Here, take my sweater.
- I don't want it.

25:44.809 --> 25:46.470
Look, a car.

25:46.645 --> 25:48.374
Oh, yeah,
like he's really gonna stop.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.105
Why wouldn't he?

25:50.282 --> 25:52.580
I mean, even if he does,
do we really want him to?

25:52.751 --> 25:54.946
Stuart, have some faith.

25:58.690 --> 26:00.351
Hi, thanks for stopping.

26:00.525 --> 26:03.426
Look, something happened to our car,
could you give us a ride?

26:03.595 --> 26:04.619
We need to use a phone.

26:04.829 --> 26:09.266
Well, Ada Mae's Cozy Court's
down the road about 30 miles.

26:09.434 --> 26:11.561
That sounds great.
Stuart, come on, we've got a ride.

26:11.736 --> 26:13.931
No, go ahead.
I'm not leaving my car.

26:14.105 --> 26:15.367
Stuart, I'm not going by myself.

26:19.678 --> 26:21.612
Thanks a lot. We really appreciate it.

26:24.649 --> 26:26.241
You guys better ride in the back.

26:34.993 --> 26:38.053
Well, at least we're on our way.

26:47.639 --> 26:50.130
Hey, Kelly, got enough pasta?
Brandon's here.

26:50.308 --> 26:52.299
Kel, now, slow yourself down,
it's all right.

26:52.477 --> 26:53.501
No chow for me, thanks.

26:53.678 --> 26:54.838
Are you sure? We have plenty.

26:55.013 --> 26:57.072
It's a rigatoni with marinara sauce.

26:57.248 --> 27:00.342
Well, my girlfriend.
I think I'll keep her.

27:01.252 --> 27:04.653
I think he's missed a few chapters
in my power-feminism books.

27:04.823 --> 27:06.984
Brandon, sit down.

27:07.158 --> 27:09.023
What's going on?
We haven't seen you in a while.

27:09.194 --> 27:10.718
Well, between school
and the task force,

27:10.895 --> 27:12.556
everything's kind of a blur.

27:12.731 --> 27:15.359
<i>Listen, did that guy
from The Condor contact you guys</i>

27:15.533 --> 27:18.263
about interviewing you
for that piece he's doing on me?

27:18.436 --> 27:20.631
Not us, but he met with Donna.

27:20.805 --> 27:22.102
She said that he started to groan

27:22.273 --> 27:23.968
every time she mentioned
you as incredible.

27:24.509 --> 27:26.101
Evidently, that's all he's been hearing.

27:26.277 --> 27:29.644
He groaned. Sounds like
you're gonna get a rave review.

27:30.015 --> 27:33.542
Hopefully, but that's not the only thing
I came here to talk to you guys about.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.315
The task force
has a lot of social functions.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.424
And there's actually a very important
one tomorrow at the Chancellor's.

27:40.825 --> 27:44.124
Why, Brandon, are you inviting us?
I wouldn't know which T-shirt to wear.

27:44.295 --> 27:47.458
That's okay, because
I just came here to invite Kelly.

27:47.632 --> 27:48.826
- Me?
- Yeah.

27:49.334 --> 27:52.064
This isn't exactly the kind of thing
I can bring a blind date to,

27:52.237 --> 27:54.432
so I thought maybe I'd bring a friend.

27:54.606 --> 27:57.234
But Donna and David
are having a get-together tomorrow.

27:57.409 --> 27:59.809
Yeah, I know, but the chancellor's
thing is in the afternoon.

27:59.978 --> 28:02.572
So we can make it to both.
What do you say?

28:03.081 --> 28:05.709
- What do you say?
- You wanna borrow my girlfriend?

28:06.751 --> 28:09.948
I don't know, Bran. I mean,
a girlfriend's kind of like a surfboard,

28:10.121 --> 28:12.988
it's not the type of thing you wanna
loan out, you know what I'm saying?

28:13.158 --> 28:16.286
I don't get you. One minute he's
trying to persuade me to move out,

28:16.461 --> 28:18.122
the next minute,
he's trying to lock me in.

28:18.296 --> 28:19.854
I'm just teasing, Kel.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.965
Good, because I'd love to go.

28:22.133 --> 28:24.863
I wanted to meet the chancellor.
Did you know he won a Nobel Prize?

28:25.370 --> 28:27.463
Yes, I did.

28:27.639 --> 28:29.800
Listen, guys,
maybe this just isn't right.

28:29.974 --> 28:32.272
If it's too weird for you, bro,
I totally understand.

28:32.444 --> 28:33.468
I don't know, man.

28:33.645 --> 28:35.545
Since she's been under
Lucinda Nicholson's spell,

28:35.714 --> 28:37.147
nothing is too weird for her.

28:37.315 --> 28:39.715
Oh, stop it, Dylan,
you like her and you know it.

28:39.884 --> 28:40.908
I don't know about that.

28:41.086 --> 28:44.613
I think she is a liberating example
for you young ladies to look up to.

28:45.056 --> 28:48.082
Okay, if you wanna take her out
as an escort for the evening, fine.

28:48.259 --> 28:49.920
Just bring her back
without any dings.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.021
Got it.

28:53.198 --> 28:56.895
The number's 555-4871 if anyone
at the house is looking for me.

28:57.068 --> 28:59.798
<i>And thank whoever it was that left
this Playboy underneath my door,</i>

28:59.971 --> 29:01.461
I really appreciate it.

29:02.640 --> 29:03.937
Muntz, it was you?

29:04.109 --> 29:07.101
Dude, you're such a stud... Sigma?

29:07.278 --> 29:08.802
What page? What page?

29:10.381 --> 29:11.848
Yeah?

29:14.352 --> 29:15.512
Hold on.

29:15.687 --> 29:17.814
Hi. I hope I'm not interrupting you.

29:17.989 --> 29:19.251
Well, actually, you are.

29:19.891 --> 29:22.985
I'm busy working
on my computer here.

29:23.161 --> 29:25.288
Tinkling on the keyboard,
processing data.

29:25.463 --> 29:28.261
Well, tink, take it from
a computer-science major,

29:28.433 --> 29:30.924
you might wanna turn it on first.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.100
I'm also your floor RA.

29:38.243 --> 29:39.505
You're Kathy Fisher.

29:39.677 --> 29:42.145
And you're Steve Sanders.

29:43.014 --> 29:44.538
Kind of what I thought.

29:44.716 --> 29:46.980
In my dumber days,
I used to date KEG men.

29:47.152 --> 29:49.143
Hey, come on, there's some
outstanding KEG brothers.

29:49.320 --> 29:53.017
Look, I'm only allowing this
arrangement as a favor to Andrea.

29:53.191 --> 29:56.126
If the room's vacant, she could lose it,
and I don't wanna see that happen.

29:56.294 --> 29:57.625
And neither do I.

29:58.163 --> 29:59.562
Then keep it honest, Sanders.

29:59.731 --> 30:01.062
Always.

30:08.473 --> 30:13.467
Hey, Muntz, you'd better cancel me
on that six-pack.

30:20.885 --> 30:23.285
Well, it is just for one night.

30:24.556 --> 30:27.491
Remind me not to
take a shower, please.

30:28.393 --> 30:31.294
Well, I admit,
Ada Mae was a little eccentric.

30:31.462 --> 30:34.295
Eccentric?
The woman was talking to herself.

30:34.465 --> 30:35.557
She's probably just lonely.

30:35.733 --> 30:38.896
How could she be lonely
with all those cats?

30:39.070 --> 30:41.095
You do know
I'm allergic to cats, don't you?

30:41.272 --> 30:43.137
Stuart, if you called
your father at the resort,

30:43.308 --> 30:45.469
he would send
a car for us right now.

30:46.010 --> 30:49.275
I am not calling my father
for help, okay?

30:49.447 --> 30:53.907
Well, then, relax, all right?
I'm sure there are no cats in here.

30:57.555 --> 30:58.647
You know, in a couple years,

30:58.823 --> 31:01.291
I'm sure we'll look back at all this
and laugh our heads off.

31:01.459 --> 31:02.448
I doubt it.

31:04.729 --> 31:07.527
Stuart,
where is your sense of humor?

31:07.699 --> 31:09.599
It's out in the desert, Brenda.

31:09.767 --> 31:12.634
- I said I was sorry.
- That makes two of us.

31:12.804 --> 31:14.795
We should have just
gone back and gotten the car.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.871
It was your idea to stay here.

31:17.041 --> 31:20.533
Only because you were
whining about being so tired.

31:22.247 --> 31:24.875
You know, it's really not that bad.

31:25.250 --> 31:26.842
How are we supposed
to fit on that thing?

31:27.619 --> 31:29.985
Well, if we snuggle real close,
I'm sure it will be fine.

31:31.022 --> 31:34.082
I'm just gonna crash on the chair.

31:38.796 --> 31:39.820
Stuart?

31:39.998 --> 31:42.091
I just wanna get some sleep,
okay, Brenda?

31:43.368 --> 31:44.596
Fine.

31:44.769 --> 31:46.600
It will probably be
much better in the morning.

31:54.078 --> 31:56.103
Brandon, you shouldn't
drop by without telling me.

31:56.281 --> 31:58.841
Why, is there some other guy
kicking in your stall?

31:59.017 --> 32:01.713
Don't be silly.

32:01.886 --> 32:06.152
It's just I might have had a colleague
in, or anyone, for that matter.

32:06.324 --> 32:07.916
I don't wanna blow this
by being careless.

32:08.092 --> 32:11.892
Well, then maybe you shouldn't be
walking around in my flannel shirt.

32:12.430 --> 32:14.227
I'll risk it.

32:15.233 --> 32:18.202
I like having the smell of you
around when you're not here.

32:23.341 --> 32:24.968
Is that the cologne I got you?

32:25.143 --> 32:27.008
Oh, you noticed.

32:28.146 --> 32:30.273
So you're reworking your proposal?

32:30.448 --> 32:34.578
Yeah, I'm trying to beef it up
with more pictures and sketches.

32:35.653 --> 32:37.712
I just don't know
if I'm kidding myself.

32:37.889 --> 32:39.982
I mean, maybe...

32:40.158 --> 32:42.991
Maybe it's all really too ordinary.

32:43.161 --> 32:45.823
Oh, hey, now, don't you start
getting down on yourself.

32:45.997 --> 32:48.124
This is extraordinary work
you're doing.

32:48.299 --> 32:52.133
It's gonna change the way men
and women view each other forever.

32:52.303 --> 32:54.066
Trust me, you're on the cutting edge.

32:54.238 --> 32:55.364
Oh, you really think so?

32:55.540 --> 32:57.371
Yeah. I've got the scars to prove it.

32:59.844 --> 33:04.144
It just feels so strange getting
all this together for a student to review.

33:04.849 --> 33:06.339
But Kelly says Dylan's really serious.

33:06.517 --> 33:10.544
Well, backing a film would certainly
fill a void in Dylan's financial empire.

33:12.090 --> 33:15.685
Well, there's that tone again.
I thought you guys were friends.

33:16.728 --> 33:19.856
- We are friends.
- Sounds more like competitors.

33:20.031 --> 33:22.226
Just so long as
we're not competing for you.

33:23.701 --> 33:26.101
So that's what this is about.

33:26.437 --> 33:27.597
You're jealous.

33:27.772 --> 33:29.364
No, I am not jealous.

33:29.540 --> 33:32.134
I'd just like to be able to take you out
for a megaburger sometime

33:32.310 --> 33:34.403
without having to sit
at separate booths.

33:34.579 --> 33:37.639
Well, be careful what you wish for,
you might get it.

33:46.090 --> 33:48.149
Look at this thing.
My dad is going to kill me.

33:48.326 --> 33:50.453
I knew I shouldn't
have listened to you.

33:50.628 --> 33:53.859
Great. Beautiful.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.899
I knew I should've stayed with this car.
But, hey, what do I know, right?

33:57.068 --> 33:59.332
- Stuart?
- Oh, right.

33:59.504 --> 34:02.098
I can't wait to laugh
about this someday.

34:14.018 --> 34:16.248
Brandon, I'm so nervous,
I've got goose bumps.

34:16.420 --> 34:17.683
What am I supposed to do again?

34:17.855 --> 34:19.686
If you forget how to talk,
just nod and smile.

34:19.857 --> 34:21.848
Believe me, it'll work.

34:22.025 --> 34:23.391
Here comes the dean.

34:23.561 --> 34:24.822
- Brandon.
- Dean.

34:24.996 --> 34:26.121
- Glad you're here.
- Thanks.

34:26.297 --> 34:27.559
And who is this?

34:27.732 --> 34:30.132
Dean Trimble, this is Kelly Taylor.

34:30.301 --> 34:32.360
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Likewise.

34:32.804 --> 34:34.396
I was getting worried
Brandon didn't know

34:34.572 --> 34:36.130
the value of an active social life.

34:36.306 --> 34:38.002
Well, you don't have to worry
about Brandon.

34:38.176 --> 34:39.473
He's a Renaissance man.

34:39.643 --> 34:43.512
He's just so good at so many things,
but never loses sight of his priorities.

34:43.681 --> 34:46.445
Right now,
I'd say his top priority was you.

34:46.884 --> 34:50.411
Well, today my attention
will also be on lobbying

34:50.588 --> 34:52.351
for the task force
with the chancellor.

34:52.523 --> 34:54.320
Yes, and with the chancellor
being the host,

34:54.492 --> 34:57.757
it's gonna be hard to get his ear
on our issues, Brandon.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.988
Come on, at least
I'd like you to meet him.

35:00.164 --> 35:01.961
Lead on.

35:02.667 --> 35:04.635
Renaissance man?

35:04.802 --> 35:06.963
I just opened my mouth
and out it came.

35:07.138 --> 35:08.605
- Did it make any sense?
- Absolutely.

35:08.773 --> 35:11.674
- Thank you.
- Good afternoon, Josh.

35:18.483 --> 35:19.882
Let's just make nice, okay?

35:20.051 --> 35:22.110
- Hello, Brenda.
- Hi.

35:22.286 --> 35:24.447
How are you?
Always a pleasure to see you.

35:24.622 --> 35:25.680
Thank you.

35:25.857 --> 35:28.553
Vivian went to do a little shopping,
but she'll be back soon.

35:28.726 --> 35:31.194
I know she was
looking forward to seeing you.

35:31.362 --> 35:34.263
And I was looking forward
to seeing you.

35:34.432 --> 35:35.956
Sorry we're late.

35:36.134 --> 35:40.468
You know, son, as hard as I try,
I can never understand you.

35:40.638 --> 35:43.368
You were the one who insisted
on having a meeting this morning.

35:43.541 --> 35:46.101
You announce that you have
something important to tell me.

35:46.277 --> 35:49.440
And then you don't even have
the decency to show up on time.

35:49.614 --> 35:51.809
Dad, it couldn't be helped.
We had problem with the car.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.507
Let me tell you something.

35:53.684 --> 35:55.276
If I had a meeting with my boss,

35:55.453 --> 35:57.512
I wouldn't let anything
get in the way of it.

35:57.688 --> 35:58.985
It wasn't my fault.

35:59.157 --> 36:02.024
Oh, then whose fault was it?

36:04.228 --> 36:06.025
We made a stop
in the middle of nowhere,

36:06.197 --> 36:08.256
and Brenda was cold,
so she went back to the car

36:08.432 --> 36:11.526
to get her sweater,
and she locked the keys inside.

36:12.703 --> 36:14.261
Tell him, Bren.

36:14.438 --> 36:16.565
Did it ever occur to you
that you could be a gentleman

36:16.741 --> 36:18.368
and get the sweater for her?

36:18.543 --> 36:20.807
Or would that have
required too much effort?

36:20.978 --> 36:23.310
I don't even know
why I bother with you anymore.

36:23.481 --> 36:25.540
- Neither do I.
- Brenda...

36:25.716 --> 36:28.651
No, I don't know why
I bother with either one of you.

36:28.819 --> 36:30.878
Why don't you ever
give your son half a chance?

36:31.489 --> 36:32.581
He wouldn't be such an idiot

36:32.757 --> 36:35.055
if he wasn't constantly trying to
prove himself to you.

36:35.226 --> 36:37.524
Brenda, will you please
let me take care of this?

36:37.695 --> 36:40.061
Oh, make no mistake, Stuart.
You are an idiot.

36:40.898 --> 36:44.299
I can't believe I thought this weekend
would be the beginning of anything.

36:44.468 --> 36:48.370
I can't believe I kept your damn ring.
Here, take it, I don't even want it.

36:50.341 --> 36:52.138
Brenda, wait.

36:52.510 --> 36:53.841
Are you gonna get the ring?

36:54.011 --> 36:57.447
Or are you gonna leave it there
as a tourist attraction?

37:04.388 --> 37:06.754
- Yeah?
- Dylan, hi, is Kelly there?

37:06.924 --> 37:09.916
Sorry, Bren, no, she's at
a power luncheon with your brother.

37:10.494 --> 37:12.587
I guess that's why
he didn't pick up his phone either.

37:12.763 --> 37:14.060
Something wrong, Bren?
Can I help?

37:14.232 --> 37:16.723
No, I was just hoping that Kelly
could come and get me.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.425
I guess I'm kind of stranded.

37:18.603 --> 37:20.798
That's okay, just tell me
where you're at and I'll come.

37:20.972 --> 37:22.439
It's not quite that simple.

37:22.607 --> 37:24.097
Bren, it's not a problem.

37:24.275 --> 37:26.903
Listen, I'll just take the bus.
Forget that I called, okay?

37:27.078 --> 37:28.102
Would you stop it already?

37:28.279 --> 37:31.407
Just tell me where you're at,
I'll jump in the car, I'll come get you.

37:31.582 --> 37:33.516
Palm Springs.

37:46.664 --> 37:48.029
Where's Kelly?

37:48.199 --> 37:49.757
Talking with the chancellor.

37:49.934 --> 37:52.232
- Again?
- Yes.

37:52.737 --> 37:54.864
When I left they were discussing
a hip birthday present

37:55.039 --> 37:56.506
he could buy
for his teenage daughter.

37:56.674 --> 37:59.302
That, of course, came after
their talk about Madonna,

37:59.477 --> 38:02.241
goddess or fraud?

38:03.948 --> 38:07.179
She's definitely an asset, Brandon.

38:12.523 --> 38:13.547
God, that was so exciting.

38:13.724 --> 38:15.589
I actually talked
to a Nobel Prize winner.

38:15.760 --> 38:17.728
Talked to him?
You monopolized him.

38:17.895 --> 38:20.557
- Yeah, I did, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.

38:21.399 --> 38:23.959
You were terrific. Thank you.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.797
You know what?
I think you and I make a good team.

38:27.405 --> 38:28.702
I think so too.

38:29.740 --> 38:32.937
Whoever said all the good ones
were taken obviously never met you.

38:33.110 --> 38:34.839
You've gotta be
the best catch on campus.

38:39.717 --> 38:44.211
Well, the night is young
and we have another party to go to.

38:44.388 --> 38:46.253
Yeah, we do.

38:47.224 --> 38:48.248
Shall we?

38:49.160 --> 38:50.957
Sure.

39:01.439 --> 39:03.373
Thanks for coming to my rescue.

39:03.541 --> 39:06.408
Hey, if I can't do it, who can?

39:06.577 --> 39:08.306
Good question.

39:08.913 --> 39:10.642
I don't suppose
you wanna talk about it?

39:13.384 --> 39:15.875
It was gonna be
a romantic weekend with Stuart.

39:17.722 --> 39:19.986
I ended up seeing a side of him
I had never seen before.

39:21.726 --> 39:24.627
Remember when we went to Baja
and I made that little mistake?

39:24.829 --> 39:27.923
Little mistake?
Bren, you lost your passport.

39:28.099 --> 39:29.999
We were stuck at the border
for three hours.

39:30.167 --> 39:33.034
But no matter how bad things got,

39:33.204 --> 39:35.729
you were so understanding.

39:35.906 --> 39:38.466
We were able to put it behind us.
Even laugh about it.

39:38.642 --> 39:41.042
We ended up having a great time.

39:42.012 --> 39:44.105
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

39:45.349 --> 39:46.680
Stuart can't do that.

39:48.185 --> 39:51.279
I goofed and he just couldn't let it go.

39:51.722 --> 39:53.690
It got pretty ugly.

39:54.191 --> 39:55.522
It's definitely over between us.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.830
Why is it that I can't keep
any relationship going

40:00.998 --> 40:03.228
since I broke up with you?

40:04.068 --> 40:06.434
I guess you've just gotta
find the right guy.

40:07.071 --> 40:10.438
No, I had the right guy,
and then I lost him.

40:14.812 --> 40:16.541
I've never really gotten
over you, Dylan.

40:18.983 --> 40:20.507
How can I fall in love
with someone else

40:20.684 --> 40:22.413
when I'm still in love with you?

40:22.586 --> 40:24.679
- Bren...
- I know, I know.

40:25.122 --> 40:27.920
It's not that I don't love you.

40:28.092 --> 40:30.151
It's just that you're not
in love with me.

40:32.730 --> 40:35.824
Maybe I'm just feeling sorry for myself
over this Stuart thing.

40:39.703 --> 40:41.261
I'm really glad we're still friends.

40:42.706 --> 40:43.798
So am I.

40:47.445 --> 40:50.209
So, what do you say
we join everybody at David's?

40:50.381 --> 40:51.973
He's rechristening the place.

40:52.149 --> 40:53.309
Yeah.

40:53.484 --> 40:55.281
All right.

40:57.521 --> 40:59.682
Dinner's on.

40:59.857 --> 41:01.916
All right.

41:02.092 --> 41:03.957
- Fingers off.
- Smells good, what is it?

41:04.128 --> 41:05.823
- Thanks.
- Shish kebabs.

41:05.996 --> 41:08.487
I like to think of them
as kind of symbolic.

41:08.666 --> 41:11.760
Each piece on each one
represents one of you guys.

41:11.936 --> 41:13.597
Friends I know I'll never forget.

41:15.105 --> 41:18.165
And in case you're wondering,
I'm the tomato.

41:18.342 --> 41:20.537
Well, in that case, I'm the beef.

41:21.078 --> 41:22.306
Hey, guys, you got the piano?

41:22.480 --> 41:24.744
Yes, and David is giving me lessons.

41:25.282 --> 41:27.512
What about me? I want lessons.

41:27.685 --> 41:29.778
Does that mean
what I think it means?

41:29.954 --> 41:33.355
Yup, I'm moving back in.

41:33.524 --> 41:35.617
It's time to take
the tough out of tough love.

41:35.793 --> 41:37.761
Well, Dylan will be happy
to hear that.

41:37.928 --> 41:40.158
Where is he?
He's supposed to be here, isn't he?

41:40.331 --> 41:42.458
Okay, a sparkling-cider toast

41:42.633 --> 41:44.828
to the new and improved
beach apartment.

41:45.002 --> 41:46.026
Hear, hear.

41:46.203 --> 41:47.602
And to the three musketeers.

41:48.806 --> 41:50.535
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

41:51.775 --> 41:54.903
Now, for your dining pleasure,
Donna and I will entertain you.

41:55.079 --> 41:56.410
Oh, David, I only know one song.

41:56.580 --> 42:00.209
- But it's a ditty. Come on.
- Go, brother.

42:00.384 --> 42:01.817
- Go ahead.
- Yeah.

42:01.986 --> 42:05.251
Let me guess,
you're going to play a nocturne.

42:06.757 --> 42:08.281
- Okay, right here.
- Ready.

42:26.043 --> 42:28.034
Whoa, you guys
having a party or what?

42:28.212 --> 42:31.875
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, guys, we're glad you're here.

42:32.049 --> 42:35.177
Bren, aren't you supposed to be
in Palm Springs with Stuey?

42:35.352 --> 42:36.546
Who?

42:36.720 --> 42:38.711
Thank God Dylan was
nice enough to bring me home.

42:38.889 --> 42:41.050
Yeah, no problem.

42:41.225 --> 42:43.523
I'm gonna get some food.

42:43.694 --> 42:46.891
So did you have a good time
at the chancellor's?

42:47.064 --> 42:48.554
It was great.

42:48.732 --> 42:52.725
So is this why you're
so anxious for me to move out?

42:53.337 --> 42:55.134
Yeah, right.

42:56.206 --> 43:00.734
Why don't you get some food. I'm sure
you're hungry from your long ride.

43:01.378 --> 43:03.175
I'll tell you what, Bran,

43:03.347 --> 43:07.943
if you ever feel the need
to borrow her again, feel free.
