00:16.975 --> 00:21.313
Ooh! I'm so happy to be
in these genie outfits again.

00:21.313 --> 00:22.731
But where are ours?

00:22.731 --> 00:25.567
I haven't been able to settle
on a design for you guys yet.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.110
Besides, I'm backordered.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.153
Ally: Works for me.

00:28.153 --> 00:30.572
I'm not really much of
a "Genie Chic" type.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.282
I consider myself
a little more...

00:32.282 --> 00:33.909
"Wonderland Unique".

00:33.909 --> 00:36.453
Okay, people.
This is crunch time.

00:36.453 --> 00:38.872
Auradon Prep's Annual
Fighting Knights Ball
is coming up,

00:38.872 --> 00:40.707
and we still don't have
a theme for the party.

00:40.707 --> 00:41.959
Ooh, I know!

00:41.959 --> 00:44.294
Let's do a pretty,
pretty princess theme.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.254
We did that last year,

00:45.254 --> 00:48.006
and the year before,
and the year before.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.550
‐I have an idea.
‐Audrey: Let me guess.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.385
You want everyone
to wear purple?

00:51.385 --> 00:53.053
No. (scoffs)

00:53.053 --> 00:54.221
‐Yes!
‐Evie: (gasps)

00:54.221 --> 00:57.432
What about a
"Who's the fairest?" party?

00:57.432 --> 01:00.102
It'll be a competition.
The winner will
get everything,

01:00.102 --> 01:01.895
and the loser
will get nothing.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.648
‐That sounds mean.
‐Thanks!

01:04.648 --> 01:06.400
How about a
kickboxing hip hop ball?

01:06.400 --> 01:08.402
So you dance
while you punch your friend?

01:08.402 --> 01:10.320
Now that's
my kind of party.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.114
What about a
garden pumpkin party?

01:12.114 --> 01:14.658
We could decorate
everything with pumpkins!

01:14.658 --> 01:15.867
Bippity boppity!

01:17.494 --> 01:19.162
Ooh, I love pumpkins.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.623
You wanna throw a
garden vegetable party?

01:21.623 --> 01:22.958
How about a wicked ball?

01:24.293 --> 01:26.336
Hmm. Can't change perfect.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.630
Perfectly imperfect.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.092
A genie party!

01:32.092 --> 01:34.219
You want a party
that celebrates you?

01:34.219 --> 01:36.305
Well, yeah.
I'm fabulous.

01:36.305 --> 01:38.932
A fighting knights party.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.225
‐A party in the dark.
‐(finger snaps)

01:40.225 --> 01:42.686
‐Jordan:
Magic carpet ride party.
‐(finger snaps)

01:42.686 --> 01:46.273
‐How about a
wonderful wonderland party?
‐(finger snaps)

01:47.774 --> 01:50.861
‐Neon glow party!
‐(finger snaps)

01:50.861 --> 01:53.822
I have an idea. Why don't
we just do all of our themes?

01:53.822 --> 01:56.116
‐That sounds like madness.
‐Exactly.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.618
It'll be a mad princess,
hip hop, party in the dark,

01:58.618 --> 02:02.539
magic carpet, wicked wonderland,
garden, neon lights party!

02:02.539 --> 02:05.292
Wait! A neon lights party!

02:05.292 --> 02:06.752
That's actually really cool!

02:06.752 --> 02:10.255
It could be some sort of
neon light filled mash up
of all of our ideas

02:10.255 --> 02:13.842
with everyone glowing via
Evie's neon fashion invention.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.928
Or do you guys wanna
talk about it for
a few more hours?

02:16.928 --> 02:18.555
‐All: No!
‐Great!

02:18.555 --> 02:20.390
I'll start working
on the e‐blast.

02:20.390 --> 02:23.602
Oh, what to wear?
What to wear?

02:23.602 --> 02:26.438
Just the right neon fashion
will be... phosphoressential!

02:26.438 --> 02:28.357
(laughter)

02:28.357 --> 02:29.775
