you're awesome.

I-- I have
a thousand things to say.

02:29.687 --> 02:32.787
So, I am-- I'm just not gonna
say anything and, uh...

02:33.559 --> 02:36.857
we're gonna begin with, uh--
thank you.

02:37.662 --> 02:38.727
Um...

02:39.466 --> 02:40.861
I'm gonna begin
with the first song

02:40.896 --> 02:42.764
that I ever wrote
for Simon.

02:43.371 --> 02:45.503
It's, uh,
it's called "Too Smart."

02:45.538 --> 02:48.506
-Whoo!

02:48.541 --> 02:49.804
Uh, I should just say,

02:49.839 --> 02:51.377
I wrote this
after a few martinis.

02:51.412 --> 02:52.840
So, this is more like

02:52.875 --> 02:55.414
the fantasy version
of our first date,

02:55.449 --> 02:57.482
which isn't far from what
actually happened,

02:57.517 --> 03:00.353
except that, in reality,
we slept together

03:00.388 --> 03:02.586

04:34.845 --> 04:36.812
-Nurturing my weaknesses.
-Uh-huh.

04:36.847 --> 04:39.914

is first on the list?

04:40.653 --> 04:41.619

04:45.152 --> 04:46.756

-What did you break?
-Nothing.

04:50.157 --> 04:53.026
-Nothing, I'm just feeling--
-Guilty?

04:54.799 --> 04:55.897
Grateful.

04:56.867 --> 04:57.932
Good.

04:58.869 --> 05:00.506
You're about to get
gratefuler.

05:00.541 --> 05:02.706
Oh, gratefuler's not a...

05:03.940 --> 05:05.643
You're just gonna leave
the whole place like this?

05:08.175 --> 05:10.714
Hey,
this is a total disregard for--

05:10.749 --> 05:11.814
I have some news.

05:14.082 --> 05:16.082
-Well, so do I.
-You look dapper.

05:16.755 --> 05:18.953
-Well, that's not news.
-Were you at a funeral?

05:18.988 --> 05:20.460
What? No.

05:20.495 --> 05:21.956
I had
that photoshoot before my--

05:23.465 --> 05:24.530
Dapper? Really?

05:25.830 --> 05:26.895
Huh, thank you.

05:28.098 --> 05:30.030
I'm kinda itchy, though.
I think I'm allergic to tweed.

05:30.065 --> 05:31.669
Can-- can you remind me
to get a toothbrush?

05:31.704 --> 05:33.572
-Mine fell in the toilet.
-Okay.

05:33.607 --> 05:35.838
So, does your news
by any chance involve Ritalin?

05:35.873 --> 05:37.609
Uh, no, it, uh...

05:40.042 --> 05:41.943
it involves, uh, eggs.

05:42.649 --> 05:43.879
Disappointing.

05:43.914 --> 05:47.014
And, uh,
and-- and-- and your penis.

05:47.049 --> 05:48.389
Intriguing.

05:49.492 --> 05:50.985
And something cute and small
that you've wanted

05:51.020 --> 05:52.085
for a long time.

05:53.660 --> 05:54.758
What's that?

05:59.094 --> 06:00.665
You're getting my hopes up
right now.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.029
And if you're talking
about a bunny,

06:02.064 --> 06:03.668
-I will never forgive you.

06:03.703 --> 06:05.868
What would your penis
have to do with a bunny?

06:05.903 --> 06:07.507
Carey. Hey.

06:08.609 --> 06:09.674
Are--

06:10.644 --> 06:11.709
Are you--

06:12.514 --> 06:13.579
Wha--

06:14.846 --> 06:16.076
Holy shit!

06:16.111 --> 06:17.946
No. No, no, no.
No more swearing.

06:17.981 --> 06:19.981
We-- we have to be
role models from now on.

06:20.016 --> 06:22.753
Well-rounded role models
who-- who-- who cook.

06:22.788 --> 06:26.053
Holy fucking shit!
We're having a baby!

06:26.088 --> 06:27.824
We're having a--

06:27.859 --> 06:30.629
Oh, wait, wait.
This isn't a joke, right?

06:30.664 --> 06:32.191
No, that would be mean.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.896
You've done that
kind of thing before, Carey.

06:33.931 --> 06:35.227
Never again-- no swearing,

06:35.262 --> 06:37.031
no takeout,
no unmotivated cruelty.

06:40.542 --> 06:43.202
Holy frickin' poop!

06:43.237 --> 06:45.237
I know, right?
Wait, where are you going?

06:45.272 --> 06:47.041
Uh, I need to get some air.

06:47.076 --> 06:48.911
You can't tell anyone yet.

06:51.817 --> 06:52.882
Yes!

06:53.280 --> 06:54.884
Wait, what's yours?

06:54.919 --> 06:56.182
-What, what? My what?
-Your news.

06:57.823 --> 07:00.120
-Pales in comparison.
-I thought it might.

07:00.892 --> 07:02.463
Bill! Guess what?

07:02.993 --> 07:05.532
Today is epic! Okay?

07:06.667 --> 07:08.535
Uh, we're getting a bunny.

07:08.570 --> 07:10.163
Oh, well, keep it away
from my daughter, Savannah.

Okay, if there is a jar--
and, just as an aside,

09:58.168 --> 10:00.938
no one under the age of 80
uses the word "cursing"--

10:00.973 --> 10:02.434
it isn't activated

10:02.469 --> 10:05.008
until both parties
are aware of its existence.

10:05.043 --> 10:06.372
And five dollars?

10:07.078 --> 10:08.341
You're insane.
That's way too much.

10:09.718 --> 10:11.850
-Honey.
-Yes, love muffin?

10:11.885 --> 10:14.116

the obituaries?

10:14.151 --> 10:16.118

10:25.096 --> 10:26.293
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

10:26.966 --> 10:28.328
-Sorry.

10:29.969 --> 10:31.870
It shocks me that people

10:31.905 --> 10:33.674
go through life
with these names.

10:34.336 --> 10:36.743
Eleanor Farts, for example.

10:37.174 --> 10:39.240
-That is not in there.
-Yeah, it is.

10:40.012 --> 10:41.374
Eleanor Farts.

10:42.212 --> 10:44.245
I mean, what kind of life

10:44.280 --> 10:45.752
must she have had
with that name?

10:46.480 --> 10:47.721
Was she married?

10:48.317 --> 10:51.087
Uh, da-da-da-da,
yada, yada, yada.

10:51.122 --> 10:53.188
"Loving wife to Lewis."

10:53.223 --> 10:55.696
Lewis Farts.

10:56.358 --> 10:58.897
-And she took his name.

10:59.295 --> 11:00.734
Oh, man.

11:01.363 --> 11:03.330
They had kids.

11:04.234 --> 11:06.333
-Fucking car accidents.
-Whoa!

11:07.171 --> 11:08.709
All right.

11:09.206 --> 11:11.140
Hey,
you're gonna get us banned.

11:14.013 --> 11:15.177
-What?
-It's your rule.

11:15.212 --> 11:17.883
With the swearing.
Let's go.

11:20.052 --> 11:21.755
Fine.
Yeah, we can do that.

11:21.790 --> 11:23.020
Great. Good.

11:25.024 --> 11:26.089
-All right.
-Mm-hmm?

11:26.960 --> 11:28.421
-Mm-hmm.
-Check in there.

11:28.456 --> 11:29.730
I have so much money,
it's just--

11:30.832 --> 11:33.195
Hey,
can I borrow five dollars?

11:36.563 --> 11:38.365
Ah!

11:41.469 --> 11:42.875
Oh, this is a good one.

11:43.306 --> 11:44.745
Monica Motherfucker.

11:46.276 --> 11:47.407
Seriously.

11:51.248 --> 11:52.379
Ooh, Lavinia.

11:53.888 --> 11:54.986
I like that one.

11:56.858 --> 11:59.892
Lavinia.
I'm gonna add it to my list.

12:03.458 --> 12:04.798
What?

12:06.197 --> 12:08.395
Well,
Lavinia is a character

12:08.430 --> 12:09.803
from a Shakespeare play.

12:10.201 --> 12:11.970
Perfect,
it'll make us sound smart.

12:12.401 --> 12:13.939
She had
her hands hacked off

12:13.974 --> 12:15.567
and her tongue cut out.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.503
See, that right there is why
I don't like Shakespeare.

12:17.538 --> 12:19.274
Yeah, you always
stick to the comedies.

12:19.309 --> 12:20.880
There's fewer amputations.

12:22.917 --> 12:25.544
"How happy some
o'er other some can be.

12:25.579 --> 12:29.955
Through Athens
I am thought as fair as she."

12:30.584 --> 12:32.793
Um, why do you know that?

12:34.357 --> 12:35.422
I trod the boards.

12:36.359 --> 12:38.194
Yeah,
a few times in high school.

12:38.229 --> 12:39.327
That is a shameless lie.

12:39.362 --> 12:41.868
It is not a lie!
I never lie.

12:52.914 --> 12:55.211

Dramatic Arts Award

12:55.246 --> 12:56.278

12:57.050 --> 12:58.082
of a young lover.

12:59.018 --> 13:00.480
-I-- I am very proud of you.
-Thank you.

13:00.515 --> 13:02.416
Why haven't you bragged
about this before?

13:03.551 --> 13:05.892
Because, I...

13:05.927 --> 13:07.025
...played Helena.

13:09.359 --> 13:11.425
-Excuse me?
-I played Helena!

13:13.396 --> 13:16.199
It was an all-boys school
and I was skinny.

13:16.234 --> 13:19.873
And had rosy cheeks
and a demure disposition.

13:20.909 --> 13:22.535
Oh, my God,
can you please do another one.

13:22.570 --> 13:24.141
Absolutely not.

13:24.176 --> 13:26.077
I will let you win
the next three fights.

13:27.278 --> 13:29.916
-"And I, an old turtle."
-You played a turtle?

13:29.951 --> 13:32.479
What? No. It's a metaphor.
It's from<i> The Winter's Tale.</i>

13:32.514 --> 13:34.316
"And I, an old turtle,

13:34.351 --> 13:36.417
-will wing me--"
-Turtles can't fly.

13:36.452 --> 13:39.321
I believe Mr. Shakespeare
is referring to a turtle dove.

13:39.356 --> 13:40.487
Well then why doesn't he
just say

13:40.522 --> 13:41.994
-turtle dove?
-Oh, God.

13:42.029 --> 13:44.062
"And I, an old turtle,
will wing me

13:44.097 --> 13:46.031
to some withered bough,

13:46.066 --> 13:47.560

13:49.135 --> 13:51.300

14:03.446 --> 14:05.248
That's enough
couple time for me.

14:07.483 --> 14:09.021

14:09.056 --> 14:10.154

-Aha!

Wait, wait, wait.

wing me to school,

14:16.723 --> 14:19.328

to be shaped.

14:19.363 --> 14:22.199
-On a Saturday?
-Yeah, we have band practice.

14:22.234 --> 14:25.103
Oh, I wasn't aware
that band could shape minds.

14:26.106 --> 14:27.369

I still didn't get your name,
by the way.

24:26.805 --> 24:28.508
It's really nice
talking to you, Owen.

24:42.150 --> 24:43.622
I hope you weren't smoking
on the lawn.

24:43.657 --> 24:45.657
I wasn't smoking,
I was quitting.

24:45.692 --> 24:46.955
With a cigarette in your mouth?

24:46.990 --> 24:49.628
It's unlit
and it's menthol.

24:49.663 --> 24:51.696
-This is phase two.
-And what was phase one?

24:52.127 --> 24:53.291
Switching to menthol.

24:54.063 --> 24:55.700
You've always smoked menthols.

24:55.735 --> 24:57.262
Phase one
is a very long phase.

24:57.297 --> 24:58.868
-May I?

24:58.903 --> 24:59.968
Please do.

25:04.678 --> 25:06.612
So, why am I here?

25:07.241 --> 25:11.276
Because you missed us?

25:11.982 --> 25:14.213
No, I got a message from Simon.

25:14.248 --> 25:15.984
"Please call me, Mother.

25:16.657 --> 25:18.987
I have
important news, Mother."

25:19.990 --> 25:21.594
Yeah, so,
the normal human response

25:21.629 --> 25:23.255
would be
to just call back.

25:23.290 --> 25:24.993
I tried that several times.

25:25.897 --> 25:27.864
Oh, damn,
I must have hit the red button

25:27.899 --> 25:29.327
instead of the green one.

25:29.362 --> 25:32.231
Well, it's--
it's so nice to see you.

25:32.266 --> 25:35.872
I-- I can't think of anything
he'd need to tell you.

25:35.907 --> 25:37.874
Especially not now,
this month.

25:39.075 --> 25:40.107
What's the news?

25:40.879 --> 25:42.813
Yeah, Simon,
what's the news?

25:44.817 --> 25:45.882
You--

25:47.248 --> 25:48.313
Um...

25:49.756 --> 25:53.989
you know, that, uh,
we've decided to, uh...

25:54.992 --> 25:57.322
you know,
to get some help.

25:57.357 --> 25:58.928
With, uh, the...

26:01.735 --> 26:03.361
baby making.

26:03.396 --> 26:07.398
What Simon means
is-- is that we've decided

26:07.433 --> 26:09.235
to start trying,

26:09.270 --> 26:11.204
and, so,
if all goes well,

26:11.239 --> 26:14.845
we'll-- we'll have
some actual news sometime soon.

26:14.880 --> 26:16.715
-And-- and then...

26:16.750 --> 26:18.310
...we can wait until
the first trimester is over

26:18.345 --> 26:19.751
and we'll let you know.

26:26.155 --> 26:27.693
We're having a baby.

26:27.728 --> 26:29.288
-Simon!
-Oh, lord.

26:29.323 --> 26:31.994
-Are you sure?
-Yes, yes, mother. We're sure.

26:32.029 --> 26:34.029
-You're gonna be a grand--
-No. Don't you dare.

26:34.768 --> 26:36.031
A baby.

26:36.066 --> 26:38.165
I-- I-- I--
I'm only at ten weeks.

26:38.200 --> 26:40.871
-Nine and a half weeks.
-Very different from the movie.

26:40.906 --> 26:43.038
A baby. A baby.

26:43.073 --> 26:45.139
A baby!

26:45.174 --> 26:47.141
And, actually, it feels
kinda good to tell someone.

26:48.408 --> 26:50.144
Just because
I'm not frowning,

26:50.179 --> 26:51.915
doesn't mean
you're not in serious trouble.

26:51.950 --> 26:52.982
Didn't understand any of that,
too many negatives,

26:53.017 --> 26:54.082
just gonna keep smothering.

26:55.051 --> 26:57.151
You need to work on
delivering good news.

26:57.186 --> 26:58.790
That message was somber.

26:58.825 --> 27:00.253
-And, uh...

27:01.927 --> 27:02.992
I...

27:03.995 --> 27:07.293
well done on the--
on the baby making front.

27:07.328 --> 27:09.262
You will be
a wonderful mother.

27:09.297 --> 27:12.331
-Oh, thank you.
-Thank goodness.

27:12.366 --> 27:14.399
Because if he's anything
like his father,

27:14.434 --> 27:15.972
you'll be
bringing it up alone.

27:17.041 --> 27:18.436
-Excuse me?
-What?

27:19.175 --> 27:20.713
He abandoned us.

27:20.748 --> 27:22.440
And that kind of thing
can be genetic.

27:22.475 --> 27:24.409
He didn't abandon us,
he died.

27:24.444 --> 27:26.147
He did that, too.

27:26.182 --> 27:28.050
Okay, you know what,
this has been great.

27:28.085 --> 27:30.217
You should really invite
yourself over more often.

27:30.252 --> 27:33.022
No, hey, don't be so sensitive.
I was just pointing out--

27:33.057 --> 27:34.485
I'd rather be like him
than you.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.993
-Simon!
-And there we go.

27:37.028 --> 27:38.192
He didn't mean that.

27:38.227 --> 27:40.161
-Yes, he did!
-Um...

27:41.032 --> 27:43.230
I-- I'll get you
a glass of water, okay?

27:45.135 --> 27:47.234
No, you cannot possibly
take her side on this one.

27:47.269 --> 27:48.939
I am not taking
anyone's side,

27:48.974 --> 27:51.106
because I'm an adult,
not a six-year-old.

27:52.274 --> 27:54.846
Can you stop
putting glasses on the bottom?

27:54.881 --> 27:57.178
She makes me wanna
kill people with my hands.

27:57.213 --> 27:58.476
Then why did you phone her?

27:58.511 --> 28:00.346
Nice secret-keeping,
by the way.

28:00.381 --> 28:02.084
You should be a spy!

28:02.119 --> 28:03.349
I didn't think
she'd actually show up.

28:04.088 --> 28:05.923
You're not supposed
to tell anyone.

28:05.958 --> 28:07.452
I know, I know, I know.

28:08.191 --> 28:09.322
But
don't I look handsome?

28:11.392 --> 28:13.161
Hm? Mmm.

28:13.196 --> 28:15.900
I am gonna go out there.

28:15.935 --> 28:17.902
And I'm gonna
make her feel better.

28:17.937 --> 28:19.266
And then
I'm gonna come back in here

28:19.301 --> 28:21.301
and you're gonna
make me feel better.

28:21.336 --> 28:23.105
Wait, can I use
the magic sex pinkies?

28:23.140 --> 28:25.305
Not this time.

28:25.340 --> 28:26.878
Bev, I--

28:28.145 --> 28:29.342
I'm too upset to hydrate.

28:30.411 --> 28:31.476
I'm-- I'm really sorry.

28:32.248 --> 28:33.313
He can be cruel.

28:34.184 --> 28:35.513
Sometimes.

28:35.548 --> 28:37.119
He doesn't get it from me.

28:37.154 --> 28:38.923
He-- he might've gotten
it from me.

28:41.422 --> 28:43.389
-He loves you a lot.
-No.

28:43.424 --> 28:45.325
Aside from me,
you're the only person

28:45.360 --> 28:46.931
he's comfortable
being mean to.

28:46.966 --> 28:48.361
Ah, lucky us.

28:49.067 --> 28:50.165
Hm.

28:52.202 --> 28:55.236
Relationships are hard work.

28:55.271 --> 28:57.337
As many of you know. Uh...

28:57.372 --> 28:58.844
You can say that again.

28:58.879 --> 29:00.340
We all do--

29:00.375 --> 29:04.179
Sorry, I didn't mean
you two in particular.

29:04.214 --> 29:06.148
-You seem, um--

29:06.887 --> 29:08.381
Just-- Um--

29:09.857 --> 29:11.516
We all do stupid things

29:11.551 --> 29:15.190
and we make mistakes, but...

29:16.127 --> 29:18.061
when you're wildly in love,
you find a way

29:18.096 --> 29:19.491
to move past these mistakes.

29:20.230 --> 29:24.034
'Cause it's a rare
and miraculous thing...

29:24.597 --> 29:26.366
to find your one,
true soulmate.

29:35.410 --> 29:36.475

31:33.363 --> 31:35.000
uh, we'll just go on
to the next one.

31:49.544 --> 31:51.082
-Whoa!
-Hi, sorry.

31:51.117 --> 31:53.084
-I'm sorry. Whoa, hi.

31:53.119 --> 31:55.482
I'm-- I'm sorry.
Are you-- you okay?

31:55.517 --> 31:56.989
Yeah, I'm all right, I--

31:57.024 --> 31:57.990
my upper back's
really sensitive.

31:59.158 --> 32:00.256
-I didn't see you.
-Oh, I--

32:01.556 --> 32:02.621
You look nice.

32:03.690 --> 32:04.964
Thanks.

32:05.362 --> 32:06.658
Did I look
a little rough last time?

32:06.693 --> 32:08.165
No, no. No.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.364
I mean,
you looked a little tired,

32:09.399 --> 32:11.465
and your--
your nose was red.

32:11.500 --> 32:12.565
Like you'd been outside.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.138
Wow.

32:14.173 --> 32:15.535
In a good way.
In a cute way.

32:15.570 --> 32:17.273
Like an Irish person
or a Scottish person

32:17.308 --> 32:19.572
or someone with a--
fair complexion.

32:20.278 --> 32:22.014
-You know what I mean?
-Hm.

32:22.049 --> 32:23.213
Anyways, yeah. Hi.

32:23.710 --> 32:26.117
-You look nice today, too...
-Thanks.

32:26.152 --> 32:27.382
-...Owen.
-Thank you.

32:27.417 --> 32:28.482
Um...

32:29.551 --> 32:31.320
I'm Carey, by the way.

32:31.355 --> 32:33.520
I-- I don't think
I-- I actually told--

32:33.555 --> 32:35.390
-told you that last time--
-It said it on your card.

32:36.162 --> 32:37.425
-Right.
-Which you gave to me.

32:37.460 --> 32:39.361
-Yes.

32:41.464 --> 32:45.136
Uh, thanks for your email,
by the way.

32:45.831 --> 32:47.534
-Made me laugh.
-Good.

32:47.569 --> 32:49.041
-That wasn't my goal, but good.

32:50.077 --> 32:51.142
My goal was...

32:52.376 --> 32:54.244
to get you
to email me back, but--

32:55.742 --> 32:57.346
Um.

32:58.184 --> 33:01.251
Um, yeah,
a-- about that, um...

33:01.748 --> 33:04.023
Hey, but you're here now,
so that's a nice surprise.

33:06.555 --> 33:07.653
Full of surprises.

33:07.688 --> 33:10.128
Um, I, uh...

33:10.790 --> 33:12.064
um...

33:13.067 --> 33:15.364
I shouldn't have done
that the other day.

33:15.399 --> 33:17.432
Uh, given you my card.

33:18.501 --> 33:19.665
I'm-- I'm...

33:20.833 --> 33:24.076
I'm just not in a--
a-- any position to be--

33:24.111 --> 33:25.572
you know,
I-- I-- I can't...

33:26.410 --> 33:28.080
be going on dates,

33:28.115 --> 33:30.808
so I shouldn't be giving
out my card willy-nilly.

33:31.646 --> 33:33.250
Did you come
and see me to tell me

33:33.285 --> 33:35.087
you can't come
and see me?

33:41.458 --> 33:42.523
Um...

33:44.659 --> 33:46.065
I really liked
meeting you.

33:47.761 --> 33:49.629
I-- I just--
I have a situation.

33:49.664 --> 33:50.729
Situation?

33:51.732 --> 33:52.797
Are you taken?

33:54.504 --> 33:55.569
-Taken?
-Yeah.

33:56.671 --> 33:57.703
Taken.

33:58.541 --> 34:01.377
Uh, no, I'm not that.

34:01.412 --> 34:02.708
I'm, uh...

34:05.647 --> 34:06.679
just...

34:07.649 --> 34:08.813
Do you wanna
grab a coffee?

34:14.326 --> 34:16.425
Yes.
I-- I can't.

34:16.460 --> 34:17.822
No.
Okay, how about just a walk?

34:17.857 --> 34:19.164
Let's just walk.

34:21.927 --> 34:24.235
-Yeah, okay.
-Yes?

34:24.270 --> 34:25.632
-Yeah. Okay.
-Yes? Fabulous.

34:26.338 --> 34:27.403
Let's go right now.
Come on.

34:28.307 --> 34:30.142
What?
Aren't you on the clock?

34:30.177 --> 34:31.539
No, doesn't-- well,
I am, but, doesn't matter.

34:31.574 --> 34:33.145
Come on, let's do this.
To the walk!

34:33.180 --> 34:35.279
You...
...do you have a question?

34:35.314 --> 34:36.874
I was going for the high five,
you know?

34:36.909 --> 34:39.679
Oh! Okay.

34:39.714 --> 34:41.615
Um, okay.

34:42.486 --> 34:44.222
-Okay.
-Come on.

34:45.258 --> 34:46.356
Yeah.

34:50.527 --> 34:52.494
Oh, yeah, no,
that job will suit you better.

34:52.529 --> 34:53.924
My parents
are gonna hate you.

34:53.959 --> 34:55.926
Okay,
I'll see you at rehearsal.

34:55.961 --> 34:58.566
Keep practicing.
No excuses.

35:05.344 --> 35:06.772
Dreadful age.

35:06.807 --> 35:08.510
Can be.
That one's a good egg.

35:08.545 --> 35:10.281
I-- i-- is something wrong?

35:10.316 --> 35:11.777
Why?

35:11.812 --> 35:14.483
Y-- you just-- you've never
come here before.

35:14.518 --> 35:15.616
Ever.

35:15.651 --> 35:16.815
Today is the day...

35:17.620 --> 35:18.718
my husband left me.

35:19.721 --> 35:21.259
Oh. I'm sorry.

35:21.294 --> 35:23.624
Well, I mean--
no, no, no, not today.

35:23.659 --> 35:25.263
It was--
it was years ago.

35:26.728 --> 35:29.663
-Yes. Yeah, I--
-I've had a few Manhattans.

35:30.666 --> 35:31.797
You've earned them.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.901
You wanna know
what destroyed my marriage?

35:37.772 --> 35:39.310
I mean,
besides the fact

35:39.345 --> 35:41.279
that he slept
with hundreds of women.

35:41.314 --> 35:43.710
I mean-- I mean-- I mean
literally hun-- hundreds.

35:44.416 --> 35:45.910
-Sounds exhausting.
-Uh-huh.

35:46.814 --> 35:47.945
Secrets.

35:49.454 --> 35:51.421
Secrets killed the marriage.

35:53.326 --> 35:54.457
Now, I know...

35:54.987 --> 35:56.921
that he is not a good
communicator.

35:58.364 --> 36:01.563
But that just means
that you have to try.

36:01.598 --> 36:04.335
Even-- even if it means

36:04.370 --> 36:06.766
opening up a box of worms.

36:07.901 --> 36:10.605
-Can of...
-Can of worms.

36:11.476 --> 36:12.871
-Oh, baby.
-Ah--

36:13.940 --> 36:15.214
Reflex.

36:15.645 --> 36:17.612
Um--
I'm sorry.

36:23.389 --> 36:24.751
-Uh--
-Bye, girls.

36:25.886 --> 36:27.589
Those three are dreadful.

36:28.053 --> 36:30.526
Maybe I'll let Simon
handle the teen years.

36:31.496 --> 36:34.266
So, you're, uh,
happy now, aren't you?

36:35.500 --> 36:36.565
Yeah.

36:37.370 --> 36:38.402
Cling to it.

36:38.932 --> 36:40.503
Memorize it.

36:44.674 --> 36:45.970
They always leave.

36:59.854 --> 37:02.261
Shoot.

37:06.927 --> 37:08.960
She's having a baby,
she needs to know.

37:08.995 --> 37:11.996
Uh, I'm so sorry.
I totally forgot.

37:13.373 --> 37:14.669
She's been doing that a lot.

37:15.375 --> 37:16.473
Well, she's here now,

37:16.508 --> 37:17.837
so you can speak
to her directly.

37:17.872 --> 37:19.311
-It's not a problem.

37:20.105 --> 37:21.907
Um, I wanted to talk to you
about your period.

37:23.383 --> 37:25.075
-Buy me dinner first.

37:25.110 --> 37:27.319
What was day one
of your last cycle?

37:30.115 --> 37:32.082
Two months ago,
three months ago...

37:32.117 --> 37:35.393
-I think she's talking to me.
-Well, then answer her.

37:36.627 --> 37:37.791
Dude, it's your mother.

37:38.894 --> 37:40.860
She showed up to my school,
drunk, so, you know...

37:41.632 --> 37:42.994
-worth responding.
-What?

37:43.029 --> 37:44.798
What did she say to you?

37:44.833 --> 37:46.030
I'll give
you guys a couple minutes?

37:47.033 --> 37:48.604
No, we're good.
I'm sorry.

37:48.639 --> 37:50.639
We-- I just need to check
my period tracker

37:50.674 --> 37:52.036
that's on my phone

37:52.071 --> 37:53.741
that my husband confiscated,
so, just...

37:54.546 --> 37:55.974
-It's okay.

38:01.652 --> 38:02.816
Take your time.

38:03.918 --> 38:05.115
Okay.

38:05.150 --> 38:07.557
Uh, thanks.

38:07.592 --> 38:08.657
So...

38:11.794 --> 38:13.563
Looks like
your due date is actually...

38:14.830 --> 38:16.863
-November 12th.

38:18.537 --> 38:20.372
That's my mother's birthday.

38:21.969 --> 38:23.837
Yay.

38:25.071 --> 38:26.807
We'll do a quick examination

38:26.842 --> 38:28.908
and then we'll look
into finding you an OBGYN.

38:29.812 --> 38:31.614
-Okay.
-All right.

38:43.826 --> 38:44.891
That's mature.

38:45.861 --> 38:46.992
Why were you so rude
in there?

38:47.797 --> 38:49.093
Honestly,
I'd rather wait until--

38:49.128 --> 38:50.732
Are you going
through something?

38:50.767 --> 38:52.129
Am I-- wow.

38:52.164 --> 38:53.867
I mean, is there something
on your mind?

38:53.902 --> 38:55.671
Huh, I don't know,
what's on my mind,

38:55.706 --> 38:58.575
episiotomies, placenta,
giant effing needles

38:58.610 --> 39:00.005
-in my spine.
-Come on.

39:00.040 --> 39:02.073
Loss of bowel control,
ripping of any kind.

39:02.108 --> 39:03.382
I don't even like children.

39:04.351 --> 39:06.143
-You're a teacher.
-Exactly. So I know.

39:06.178 --> 39:07.749
They're manipulative

39:07.784 --> 39:08.849
and they're too stupid
to even hide it.

39:08.884 --> 39:10.180
They're us, but worse.

39:10.215 --> 39:11.984
Why would I wanna
go through all that--

39:12.019 --> 39:13.854
that pain and puffiness
just so I can bring a bald,

39:13.889 --> 39:15.559
mini version of myself
into the world,

39:15.594 --> 39:17.187
and teach it all the things
that are wrong with us,

39:17.222 --> 39:18.463
plus new things--
no thanks.

39:18.498 --> 39:19.893
-Carey.
-What?

39:19.928 --> 39:20.960
I have a headache,
and you're ranting.

39:20.995 --> 39:22.467
You always have a headache!

39:22.502 --> 39:23.468
And you're ranting.

39:24.504 --> 39:27.032
-Oh, my God.
-I don't want a baby.

39:29.509 --> 39:31.443
-Yes, you do.
-My body, my choice.

39:31.478 --> 39:33.742
You've been taking pre-natal
vitamins since we met.

39:33.777 --> 39:36.008
Because they're gummies
and they're delicious.

39:36.043 --> 39:40.111
♪

39:43.886 --> 39:45.523
-Okay.

39:45.558 --> 39:47.789
-You told me you wanted this.
-I know.

39:47.824 --> 39:49.219
Okay,
so what is going on

39:49.254 --> 39:52.530
and why is it going on
so fucking loudly?

39:52.565 --> 39:53.894
Stop. Not right now.

39:56.129 --> 39:58.096
Are you okay?

39:58.131 --> 40:00.065
You're the one that's acting
like Satan's evil wife.

40:00.100 --> 40:01.836
Wouldn't that
make you Satan?

40:15.148 --> 40:16.950
Ever since
I told you about the baby,

40:16.985 --> 40:18.655
-you've been acting weird.

40:20.725 --> 40:22.626
If it's gonna change
everything, then...

40:26.566 --> 40:28.500
Are we seriously
having this conversation?

40:29.602 --> 40:30.667
Maybe we aren't ready.

40:32.704 --> 40:34.902
We've been ready
for two years.

40:34.937 --> 40:36.607
I know, I-- I just--

40:36.642 --> 40:37.905
I don't wanna feel
like I'm doing this

40:37.940 --> 40:39.544
-all by myself.
-You're not.

40:41.581 --> 40:42.778
You're not,
you--

40:47.081 --> 40:48.146
You could.

40:49.248 --> 40:50.621
What?

40:51.558 --> 40:53.052
You could.
You could do it by yourself.

40:53.087 --> 40:54.955
-So could I.
-That's what I'm talking about.

40:55.661 --> 40:58.695
It is weird to say that
to your pregnant wife.

40:58.730 --> 41:00.565
I have never
wanted anything this much

41:00.600 --> 41:01.731
in my entire life.

41:02.261 --> 41:04.096
Then why
are you being weird?

41:04.131 --> 41:05.768
How? How? How?

41:05.803 --> 41:07.198
Please,
tell me how I'm being weird.

41:07.233 --> 41:08.507
You're--

41:10.874 --> 41:12.742
You're being so nice
all the time,

41:12.777 --> 41:14.711
and you're not maintaining
eye contact.

41:14.746 --> 41:15.811
Carey, Carey.

41:16.242 --> 41:17.516
Please. Listen to me.

41:17.947 --> 41:19.848
Is it possible, possible...

41:22.622 --> 41:23.819
is it possible...

41:25.086 --> 41:27.020
that this is hormonal?

41:30.091 --> 41:31.794
Is it possible...

41:33.028 --> 41:34.929
that you are an ass face?

41:40.838 --> 41:42.035
Are you okay?

41:54.313 --> 41:55.587
No.

41:58.790 --> 42:00.691
What? Hey.

42:01.661 --> 42:02.924
Hey, no, no, no, no,
no, I just--

42:02.959 --> 42:04.222
-I just meant that--
-Oh, my God.

42:04.257 --> 42:07.159
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Carey. Carey.

42:07.194 --> 42:09.029
Why-- wh-- wh-- wh--
what do you mean-- why?

42:09.669 --> 42:11.262
-Are you-- do you hate me?
-What?

42:11.297 --> 42:12.769
Are you cheating on me?
Fuck--

42:12.804 --> 42:14.298
-What?
-Are you-- are you sick?

42:14.333 --> 42:16.168
-Carey, what is going on?
-Why aren't you okay?

42:16.203 --> 42:17.972
-What is happening?
-I get cramps. I get cramps.

42:18.007 --> 42:19.369
-Why aren't you okay?
-I-- I-- I just meant that

42:19.404 --> 42:20.975
I could never be described
as okay, okay?

42:21.010 --> 42:22.746
-I'm exquisite.
-Are you joking?

42:22.781 --> 42:24.275
-You're joking right now?
-What?

42:24.310 --> 42:26.112
I-- no, I'm just trying
to lighten the mood.

42:26.147 --> 42:28.048
But now I can see that this was
probably not the right time.

42:29.689 --> 42:31.216
-Swear to me.
-What?

42:33.121 --> 42:34.989
-Swear to me.
-Come on.

42:36.157 --> 42:38.927
-Fuckballs.
-Nothing about this is funny.

42:38.962 --> 42:41.358
Swear to me that everything is
okay, that we're gonna be okay.

42:41.393 --> 42:44.031
-Oh, my God, okay, I swear.
-Make it official.

42:44.066 --> 42:45.769
-What?

42:46.299 --> 42:47.364
Make it official.

42:49.808 --> 42:51.973
What-- it's a totally
different kind of swearing.

42:52.008 --> 42:54.679
-I'm being serious.
-Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

42:54.714 --> 42:55.779
I...

42:56.848 --> 42:59.244
Simon Patterson, swear...

43:00.819 --> 43:02.313
that everything is okay.

43:03.316 --> 43:06.185
Expand.

43:06.220 --> 43:08.319
I swear
that I do not hate you,

43:08.354 --> 43:11.388
I swear
that I am not cheating on you,

43:11.423 --> 43:12.763
and I swear that I am not...

43:13.832 --> 43:17.295
I'm-- I'm fine, okay?
I'm fine. We're fine.

43:17.330 --> 43:20.001
You're insane,
but we're fine.

43:20.036 --> 43:21.167
We're fine.

43:30.244 --> 43:31.782
I love you.

43:33.214 --> 43:34.818
But if you leave me,

43:34.853 --> 43:36.787
I will track you down
and I will kill you.

43:36.822 --> 43:38.723
And I will support you
in that decision.

43:39.352 --> 43:40.890
We can make
it through anything.

43:41.420 --> 43:43.156
We just have to
do it together.

43:43.191 --> 43:44.960
I know.

43:47.129 --> 43:48.964
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

43:52.134 --> 43:53.771

43:55.467 --> 43:56.873

46:46.341 --> 46:48.143
Okay,
I have to think of one.

46:48.178 --> 46:50.112
Um...

46:50.675 --> 46:52.081
well,
do you want kids?

46:54.415 --> 46:55.612
Yikes, that's a--

46:55.647 --> 46:57.020
that's a bigger question
than I--

46:57.055 --> 46:58.186
Okay, do you snore?

46:59.057 --> 47:01.618
Um, I do not snore,

47:01.653 --> 47:04.357
but I occasionally sleepwalk

47:04.392 --> 47:06.326
and I sleep-punch.

47:06.361 --> 47:08.427
First girl I ever dated
punched me in the face.

47:08.462 --> 47:09.593
Gave me a black eye.

47:09.628 --> 47:11.331
-In her sleep?
-No.

47:12.070 --> 47:13.498
Uh, then how does--

47:13.533 --> 47:17.040
-how does that relate to, um--
-I was asleep.

47:17.075 --> 47:19.075
-What-- what did you do?
-Well, I woke up.

47:19.572 --> 47:21.979
-No, to deserve that.
-Nothing.

47:22.014 --> 47:24.245
She was reaching
for the alarm and missed.

47:24.280 --> 47:25.917
Her depth perception was off.

47:27.019 --> 47:28.282
-Cool story.
-Thank you.

47:31.353 --> 47:33.254
-You go.
-All right.

47:34.323 --> 47:35.487
Oh,
I got a really good one.

47:35.522 --> 47:36.895
Um...

47:37.656 --> 47:39.425
what do your parents do?

47:39.460 --> 47:40.624
Nothing. They're dead.

47:42.034 --> 47:43.462
-What?
-Yeah. Yeah.

47:43.497 --> 47:44.628
Mine, too.

47:47.567 --> 47:49.006
You wanna talk about it?

47:49.976 --> 47:51.041
Uh...

47:52.144 --> 47:53.406
-Yeah, I don't really either.

47:57.181 --> 47:59.115
What about your job?
How did all that come about?

48:00.019 --> 48:03.350
You mean why does an adult
have an adolescent's job?

48:03.385 --> 48:04.648
No.

48:05.552 --> 48:07.552
I did-- I didn't mean it like
that at all.

48:09.490 --> 48:11.193
I mean--
No.

48:13.197 --> 48:14.724
Really? I think you did.

48:14.759 --> 48:16.693
I didn't.

48:16.728 --> 48:18.530
It's hard to make a living
as a musician.

48:18.565 --> 48:21.500
-News flash.
-Yeah, it certainly is.

48:23.108 --> 48:25.042
I mean,
I open for big bands sometimes,

48:25.077 --> 48:26.472
and I do
the odd orchestral gig,

48:26.507 --> 48:28.078
but there's not a lot of
money in it, so...

48:28.113 --> 48:29.442
You play classical guitar?

48:29.477 --> 48:31.015
I-- yeah,
it's not my focus, though.

48:31.677 --> 48:32.543
What's your focus?

48:33.514 --> 48:35.712
This strange woman
I met at a bookstore.

48:40.752 --> 48:42.290
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

48:43.029 --> 48:44.226
-Oh.

48:48.496 --> 48:49.968
You're honest,
aren't you?

48:51.532 --> 48:52.630
You're a good person.

48:54.106 --> 48:55.336
That kinda
feels like a trap.

49:00.409 --> 49:01.540
I don't know if I am.

49:03.511 --> 49:05.247
I feel guilty
all the time, and...

49:06.778 --> 49:09.647
like I don't even
deserve to, um...

49:14.423 --> 49:15.587
I've been thinking
about you a lot.

49:16.590 --> 49:18.557
Not a creepy amount, but...

49:18.592 --> 49:19.657
I think you're...

49:20.594 --> 49:21.626
I find you to be...

49:23.597 --> 49:26.334
You make me nervous.
Does it show?

49:27.667 --> 49:29.601
Hardly at all.

49:29.636 --> 49:31.603
I-- it's been lovely
getting to know you.

49:33.673 --> 49:35.046
Is what I mean to say.

49:37.479 --> 49:38.544
Yes, it has.

49:49.656 --> 49:52.063
-Ah, shit.
-I'm sorry.

49:52.098 --> 49:53.361
-I'm-- I'm sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

49:53.396 --> 49:54.494
-I didn't mean--
-I'm sorry.

49:55.200 --> 49:57.266
Thought it would
feel worse not to try.

49:58.236 --> 49:59.796
-Turns out I was wrong.
-Uh--

50:02.636 --> 50:04.075
I'm sorry.

50:05.540 --> 50:06.671
Um...

50:09.181 --> 50:10.246

if our penis-footed
friend here is actually,

what are we gonna name her?

55:48.652 --> 55:49.750
For what?

55:51.556 --> 55:53.787
For turning into
a raging psychopath.

55:54.559 --> 55:55.789
Oh.

55:58.222 --> 55:59.958
-Which time?

56:02.127 --> 56:03.830
Okay.

Muah.

56:26.657 --> 56:27.986
Do you want one?

56:28.021 --> 56:30.021
-Oh, I'm pregnant.
-What?

56:31.024 --> 56:32.760
Does this mean
we're having twins?

56:32.795 --> 56:34.190
-No caffeine.
-Oh, okay,

-Pregnant.
-Sashimi.

I don't think
if you eat chicken

57:26.882 --> 57:28.915

yourself a vegetar-- tarian.

apologizes when I--

when they hear, and, uh,

1:01:49.210 --> 1:01:50.847
it always makes
the repressed comedian in me

1:01:50.882 --> 1:01:52.145
want to say
"Why did you kill him?"

1:01:55.920 --> 1:01:57.513
I always thought
it would be nice for someone

1:01:57.548 --> 1:01:59.185
to just stay quiet.

How long has it been?

1:02:08.130 --> 1:02:09.294

1:02:17.975 --> 1:02:19.238
-May the fourth.
-Um,

1:02:19.273 --> 1:02:20.404
I'm gonna head out now.

1:02:21.473 --> 1:02:22.780
And, uh...

1:02:24.278 --> 1:02:27.180
maybe we can talk
later about art,

1:02:27.215 --> 1:02:28.313
or clowns or something.

1:02:29.052 --> 1:02:30.282
Uh...

1:02:30.317 --> 1:02:31.415
just not-- not this.

1:02:31.450 --> 1:02:32.548
Anything...

1:02:33.155 --> 1:02:34.352
anything but this.

1:02:38.930 --> 1:02:40.798
Um, I-- I'm sorry
for kissing you.

1:02:42.461 --> 1:02:43.592
I liked you, too.

1:02:59.148 --> 1:03:00.444
Old chocolate.

1:03:00.479 --> 1:03:02.512
Ew, Simon. Gross.

1:03:02.547 --> 1:03:03.920
Huh.

1:03:04.615 --> 1:03:06.285
-In his pocket.
-Yeah.

1:03:07.585 --> 1:03:09.992
Why don't you take a break
from this for a while?

1:03:17.430 --> 1:03:19.232
I don't know
how to do this.

1:03:20.268 --> 1:03:21.399
I know, dear.

1:03:24.305 --> 1:03:26.404
I know
that I am not always the...

1:03:27.506 --> 1:03:30.243
warmest, or the best.

1:03:31.444 --> 1:03:33.576
But I am there for you
and your daughter.

1:03:34.282 --> 1:03:36.150
Uh, or son.

1:03:37.252 --> 1:03:38.317
Now.

1:03:39.221 --> 1:03:40.154
I'm gonna smoke this.

1:03:41.058 --> 1:03:43.652
I'm gonna go outside,
I'm gonna light it,

1:03:43.687 --> 1:03:45.962
and I'm gonna smoke it.

1:05:15.350 --> 1:05:16.514
What the fuck?

1:05:23.556 --> 1:05:24.654
Bev.

1:05:28.396 --> 1:05:29.560
Bev.

1:05:30.299 --> 1:05:32.365
-Bev, Bev.
-You alright?

1:05:33.665 --> 1:05:35.005
I found this.

1:05:35.040 --> 1:05:36.600
Oh, my dear. That...

1:05:36.635 --> 1:05:38.503
This is--
this was in his pocket

1:05:38.538 --> 1:05:40.670
in with the candy wrappers
and the fucking-- Sorry.

1:05:40.705 --> 1:05:43.376
-Did you-- did you read it?
-Only the beginning.

1:05:44.313 --> 1:05:45.774
There--
those aren't good results.

1:05:45.809 --> 1:05:47.776
"Berry aneurysm?"

1:05:47.811 --> 1:05:50.218
I-- I don't even know
what that-- is that what it--

1:05:50.253 --> 1:05:52.022
-Look, le-- let's go inside.
-No, no, no.

1:05:52.057 --> 1:05:54.420
I-- I-- I--
He must've not understood this.

1:05:54.455 --> 1:05:56.059
I have to call Dr. Rose.

1:05:56.094 --> 1:05:57.555
It's not her fault.

1:05:57.590 --> 1:05:59.227
No, Simon wouldn't have
kept this from me.

1:06:00.098 --> 1:06:01.427
He-- he told me everything.

1:06:01.462 --> 1:06:03.099
He-- he--

1:06:03.134 --> 1:06:05.101
I mean he-- he gave me
daily updates on his--

1:06:05.136 --> 1:06:07.664
on his bowel movements,
for fuck sake.

1:06:07.699 --> 1:06:09.765
For God's sake.
For fuck sake!

1:06:09.800 --> 1:06:12.141
-You--you're pregnant.
-I'm fine. What--

1:06:12.176 --> 1:06:14.308
No, no I-- I mean
that maybe he thought

1:06:14.343 --> 1:06:16.772
in your condition
you couldn't handle the news.

1:06:16.807 --> 1:06:18.609
The news that he was dying?

1:06:19.843 --> 1:06:21.381
Simon doesn't lie.

1:06:22.087 --> 1:06:25.418
Bev, h-- he--
h-- he-- he didn't lie.

1:06:25.453 --> 1:06:26.782
He told me everything.

1:06:26.817 --> 1:06:28.619
He didn't tell you
about this.

1:06:36.299 --> 1:06:37.430
I'm sorry.

1:06:39.467 --> 1:06:40.565
I'm sorry.

1:06:41.304 --> 1:06:42.567
You're gonna have to...

1:06:43.405 --> 1:06:44.470
spell this out for me.

1:06:44.505 --> 1:06:45.570
You're saying that...

1:06:46.540 --> 1:06:48.309
he knew he was sick?

1:06:52.744 --> 1:06:55.712
He-- he didn't know,
obviously, how sick.

1:06:55.747 --> 1:06:59.320
He couldn't
have known how sick, right?

1:06:59.355 --> 1:07:00.453
We should've told you.

1:07:03.557 --> 1:07:04.787
He told you?

1:07:09.299 --> 1:07:11.101
Why would--
why would he tell you?

1:07:12.302 --> 1:07:14.170
Because I'm his mother.

1:07:14.205 --> 1:07:16.469
Why-- why
wouldn't you tell me?

1:07:16.504 --> 1:07:18.141
He asked me not to.

1:07:18.176 --> 1:07:19.670
I-- I-- I'm his mother.

1:07:19.705 --> 1:07:21.606
I mean, he-- he's my son.

1:07:21.641 --> 1:07:23.377
I'm sorry,
I need you to leave.

1:07:23.412 --> 1:07:25.742
No, Carey, we can
get through this together.

1:07:25.777 --> 1:07:27.744
No, I will never
get through this.

1:07:28.384 --> 1:07:30.516
I will never
get through this.

1:07:30.551 --> 1:07:33.816
My husband is dead
and now you're telling me

1:07:33.851 --> 1:07:35.785
that-- that
I didn't know him?

1:07:36.425 --> 1:07:37.886
We're having a child

1:07:37.921 --> 1:07:40.559
and he won't be here
for any of it.

1:07:43.828 --> 1:07:45.498
And he...

1:07:45.533 --> 1:07:47.731
...he made that
decision without me

1:07:47.766 --> 1:07:50.107
and he-- he had no right.

1:07:50.703 --> 1:07:52.901
No right,
and he is a liar

1:07:52.936 --> 1:07:54.507
and he's a dick.

1:07:54.542 --> 1:07:55.871
-Carey.
-He's a son of a dick.

1:07:55.906 --> 1:07:57.774
There is some truth there,
his father was--

1:07:57.809 --> 1:07:59.149
No, you.

1:07:59.679 --> 1:08:01.580
You allowed this to happen.

1:08:01.615 --> 1:08:03.582
We were trying
to protect you.

1:08:04.222 --> 1:08:06.321
Well, you didn't do
a very good job, did you?

1:08:09.359 --> 1:08:10.622
I'll come by tomorrow.

1:08:11.295 --> 1:08:12.360
No, you won't.

1:08:15.299 --> 1:08:16.496
Carey, please.

1:08:17.532 --> 1:08:18.894
I have no one else to--

1:08:23.208 --> 1:08:24.339
I'll come tomorrow.

Oh, no.
What bit you, honey?

1:11:26.083 --> 1:11:27.357
The flower.

1:11:28.426 --> 1:11:29.623
The flower bit you?

1:11:31.462 --> 1:11:32.593
Oh, no.

1:11:33.024 --> 1:11:34.661
Should we go get a band-aid?

1:11:34.696 --> 1:11:36.927
Yeah, we should
probably go get a band-aid.

1:11:36.962 --> 1:11:39.501
Okay, do we want...

1:11:39.536 --> 1:11:42.801
do you want a superhero
or a mermaid?

1:11:42.836 --> 1:11:45.342
-Supermaid.
-A supermaid?

1:11:46.873 --> 1:11:49.907
Yeah, we could definitely use
one of those around here.

1:11:52.648 --> 1:11:53.977
Is that
the supermaid at the door?

1:11:54.012 --> 1:11:55.077
What?

1:11:56.080 --> 1:11:58.421
Okay, you choose, honey.
I'll be right back.

1:11:58.456 --> 1:12:00.555
Alright? And then
we're gonna go take a nap.

1:12:04.759 --> 1:12:06.121
Uh-oh.

1:12:07.828 --> 1:12:09.432
The stalkee
has become the stalker.

1:12:10.127 --> 1:12:11.830
I hope
this isn't too bold.

1:12:12.734 --> 1:12:14.602
Bo-- bold is good.
I-- I like bold.

1:12:14.637 --> 1:12:15.999
Uh, it's just...

1:12:17.574 --> 1:12:19.541
a-- actually,
c-- come on in, yeah.

1:12:20.973 --> 1:12:22.709
-Sorry.
-Uh-huh.

1:12:29.146 --> 1:12:31.817
Your house is... not small.

1:12:32.688 --> 1:12:35.084
-Dead parents.
-Right, right.

1:12:35.119 --> 1:12:36.756
I inherited the house,
the debt,

1:12:36.791 --> 1:12:40.727
and a questionable
oil can collection.

1:12:41.763 --> 1:12:43.730
All I got
were night terrors.

1:12:50.904 --> 1:12:52.706
I want to thank you
for your message.

1:12:53.478 --> 1:12:55.676
I didn't offend you
with the whole...

1:12:55.711 --> 1:12:57.040
"let's be friends" thing?

1:12:57.075 --> 1:12:58.514
That wasn't
my favorite part.

1:12:58.945 --> 1:13:00.780
Yeah, um...

1:13:05.083 --> 1:13:06.753
Do you have a train fetish?

1:13:09.153 --> 1:13:11.956
Oh, no, uh, they,

1:13:11.991 --> 1:13:14.596
uh, actually belong
to my, uh--

1:13:14.631 --> 1:13:15.894
-Son?
-Daughter.

1:13:15.929 --> 1:13:17.093
-Oh.
-Yeah.

1:13:17.128 --> 1:13:18.193
Wow.

1:13:19.196 --> 1:13:20.701
I don't think
you mentioned that.

1:13:21.066 --> 1:13:23.033
I didn't want to lay
all of it on you at once.

1:13:23.068 --> 1:13:24.870
You didn't lay
any of it on me.

1:13:25.235 --> 1:13:26.938
I'm working
at being more open.

1:13:26.973 --> 1:13:28.071
Mhm.

1:13:29.173 --> 1:13:30.612
-Um--
-Mama!

1:13:30.647 --> 1:13:31.910
-Oh.
-Whoops.

1:13:31.945 --> 1:13:33.582
I'll be right there, honey.

1:13:33.617 --> 1:13:36.013
-I'm gonna go.
-No, please. Don't.

1:13:36.048 --> 1:13:38.554
Because she's just about
to go down for a nap.

1:13:41.053 --> 1:13:42.151
Come on.

1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:49.664
Peanut, Peanut, honey,
come meet mama's friend.

1:13:49.699 --> 1:13:51.600
-Are you sure?
-Hi.

1:13:52.603 --> 1:13:54.570
-This is Owen.
-Hey.

1:13:56.068 --> 1:13:58.475
-That looks serious.
-Yeah.

1:13:58.972 --> 1:14:00.708
A flower bit her finger.

1:14:01.909 --> 1:14:03.139
Uh, okay.

1:14:04.109 --> 1:14:05.614
Oh.

1:14:06.650 --> 1:14:08.815
I'm the pirate
and you're the bunny.

1:14:11.820 --> 1:14:13.655
You need help with that?
There you go.

1:14:13.690 --> 1:14:15.690
Good girl. Whoa.

1:14:15.725 --> 1:14:17.659
You look like a real pirate.

1:14:17.694 --> 1:14:19.496
-Are we gonna fight?

1:14:20.631 --> 1:14:22.257
Are you gonna
have a picnic?

1:14:22.292 --> 1:14:24.094
Oh, really?
I mean, my last picnic

1:14:24.129 --> 1:14:26.294
was a bit of a bust, but
maybe I'll make an exception.

1:14:26.329 --> 1:14:27.933
What do we got in there?

1:14:28.969 --> 1:14:31.673
It's milk.
We're having tea.

1:14:32.104 --> 1:14:33.906
-Oh.
-Oh.

1:14:33.941 --> 1:14:35.842
On our picnic, was that your
mother-in-law we ran into?

1:14:36.339 --> 1:14:37.745
-Bev, yeah.
-Yeah.

1:14:37.780 --> 1:14:38.977
Yeah.

1:14:39.584 --> 1:14:40.814
Is she okay?

1:14:42.081 --> 1:14:45.148
Um, I don't... I don't know.

1:14:45.183 --> 1:14:47.920
I, uh, that was the first time
I've seen her in a while.

1:14:49.319 --> 1:14:50.758
Does she live out of town?

1:14:50.793 --> 1:14:51.990
-Or--
-Um...

1:14:52.894 --> 1:14:56.192
Hey, hun,
do you want to go upstairs

1:14:56.227 --> 1:14:58.095
and go get your art stuff?

1:14:58.130 --> 1:15:00.031
Yeah? Yeah.

1:15:07.370 --> 1:15:09.205
I'm sorry,
I-- I didn't mean to...

1:15:09.911 --> 1:15:11.174
-Oh.
-Um...

1:15:11.209 --> 1:15:12.714
It's fine. I, um...

1:15:14.212 --> 1:15:16.278
Uh, I'm happy
to talk about it.

1:15:16.313 --> 1:15:18.885
-Happy to talk about anything.
-Except that you...

1:15:21.890 --> 1:15:24.088
I haven't seen her
since before the funeral.

1:15:25.993 --> 1:15:27.157
She didn't go
to the funeral?

1:15:29.128 --> 1:15:30.259
I didn't go.

1:15:31.262 --> 1:15:34.197
Um, s-- so,
how-- how did you, uh...

1:15:34.232 --> 1:15:35.704
how did you say goodbye?

1:15:37.268 --> 1:15:38.333
To her? Or...

1:15:40.304 --> 1:15:41.611
No, to him.

1:15:44.979 --> 1:15:46.143
Um...

1:15:52.657 --> 1:15:53.788
Listen to me.

1:15:53.823 --> 1:15:55.053
I like you.

1:15:57.288 --> 1:15:58.727
I-- I can't. I...

1:15:59.928 --> 1:16:01.158
I wanna be your friend.

1:16:02.700 --> 1:16:04.260
You kept some pretty
important stuff from me,

1:16:04.295 --> 1:16:05.899
and I still don't
totally understand that,

1:16:05.934 --> 1:16:06.900
but I'm not going anywhere.

1:16:08.233 --> 1:16:10.365
If you ever need somebody
to give you advice,

1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:12.675
or just someone to talk to,
I'm your man, okay?

1:16:13.975 --> 1:16:15.645
I mean your person.

1:16:16.142 --> 1:16:17.713
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1:16:19.277 --> 1:16:22.047
My first piece of advice,
for instance, would be to...

1:16:22.082 --> 1:16:23.378
get in touch with
your mother-in-law.

1:16:24.315 --> 1:16:26.788
Whoa, don't hold back. Yeah.

1:16:27.791 --> 1:16:29.791
Living with guilt
all the time is no way to live.

1:16:32.323 --> 1:16:33.729
She's...

1:16:34.963 --> 1:16:36.765
she's a bad influence.

1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:39.328
I know. She's unpredictable,
and she smokes, and...

1:16:39.363 --> 1:16:40.736
I smoke weed now and then.

1:16:41.266 --> 1:16:43.002
That's fine, I would too,

1:16:43.037 --> 1:16:44.971
but it makes my eyelids
puff up, so, I can't.

1:16:45.809 --> 1:16:47.039
I think
you should phone her.

1:16:49.010 --> 1:16:50.273
She lied to me.

1:16:50.308 --> 1:16:51.648
People lie.

1:17:00.450 --> 1:17:02.758
Hey, I was wondering.
Do you want to play with me?

1:17:07.226 --> 1:17:08.698
Music, I mean.

1:17:08.733 --> 1:17:09.996
Do you want
to play music with me?

1:17:11.197 --> 1:17:13.736
-I-- I would love to.
-Cool.

1:17:13.771 --> 1:17:15.870
I think I'm gonna have a lot
more free time on my hands.

1:17:17.302 --> 1:17:20.237
-Did you...
-I quit my job, yeah.

1:17:20.272 --> 1:17:21.810
-That's amazing.
-Thank you.

1:17:21.845 --> 1:17:23.240
I felt I wasn't gonna get
anywhere with it

1:17:23.275 --> 1:17:24.945
unless I fully
committed to it.

1:17:26.850 --> 1:17:28.179
-Right.
-Yeah, you know?

1:17:30.216 --> 1:17:31.413
It.

1:17:36.420 --> 1:17:37.793
Um...

1:17:39.357 --> 1:17:40.730
so...

1:17:41.832 --> 1:17:44.030
friends, right?

1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:46.428
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1:17:46.463 --> 1:17:48.166
Friends. Okay.

1:18:08.023 --> 1:18:10.287
Mama!
I couldn't find them.

1:18:10.322 --> 1:18:11.860
Um... Oh, my God.

1:18:11.895 --> 1:18:13.488
We-- we can, um...

1:18:13.523 --> 1:18:15.831
We can continue
this conversation--

1:18:15.866 --> 1:18:17.800
Yeah, at some other time.

1:18:17.835 --> 1:18:20.198
-Like, in a week? Or...
-I-- I'll call you.

1:18:20.871 --> 1:18:22.266
Yeah, I'll call you too.

1:18:22.301 --> 1:18:24.235
Seems excessive, but, um...

1:18:26.008 --> 1:18:29.977
♪

1:18:38.515 --> 1:18:39.789
Okay.

1:18:40.385 --> 1:18:41.516
We're gonna be serious.

1:18:48.393 --> 1:18:50.327
-Cats.
-Why?

1:18:51.429 --> 1:18:54.364
Because you can leave
them at home at night

1:18:54.399 --> 1:18:56.036
and they don't mind.

1:18:56.071 --> 1:18:57.268
How do you know?

1:19:00.141 --> 1:19:01.206
Fair point.

1:19:02.275 --> 1:19:04.440
-I'm getting a cat.
-Really, what kind?

1:19:04.475 --> 1:19:05.848
Lynx.

1:19:06.851 --> 1:19:08.411
Wow. A lynx.

1:19:08.446 --> 1:19:10.380
Well, that is a bold choice.
I'm impressed.

1:19:10.415 --> 1:19:12.987
Her daycare
did a project on Alaska.

1:19:13.022 --> 1:19:15.451
-Oh.
-Do you play guitar?

1:19:15.486 --> 1:19:17.057
I do.

1:19:22.394 --> 1:19:24.064
Wow. Not a music fan?

1:19:24.935 --> 1:19:26.198
-Short attention span.
-Hm.

1:19:26.233 --> 1:19:27.397
I don't know
where she gets it.

1:19:29.434 --> 1:19:31.500
-Hm.

1:19:32.470 --> 1:19:35.372
Oh, honey, remember I told
you to be careful with that?

1:19:37.013 --> 1:19:38.441
-Is that your mom's guitar?
-Yeah.

1:19:38.476 --> 1:19:39.816
Okay.

1:19:41.182 --> 1:19:42.379
It's very pretty.

1:19:42.414 --> 1:19:43.886
-Oh, yeah, oops.

1:19:43.921 --> 1:19:45.250
You told her to be careful,

1:19:45.285 --> 1:19:46.955
then I'm the one
who hit it on the table.

1:19:47.518 --> 1:19:48.924
Do you want me
to play something?

1:19:49.454 --> 1:19:51.058
Okay. Um...

1:19:51.621 --> 1:19:54.094
this is something

1:19:54.129 --> 1:19:56.162

1:20:01.103 --> 1:20:02.905
What are you lookin' at?

1:20:02.940 --> 1:20:04.302
I don't believe
in collaboration.

I got it.

1:20:39.240 --> 1:20:41.405
Thanks for meeting me.
For showing up.

1:20:42.507 --> 1:20:44.375
All you ever
had to do was ask.

1:20:47.215 --> 1:20:49.083
This arrived at my home.

1:20:49.987 --> 1:20:51.118
Yes.

1:20:52.022 --> 1:20:53.219
I don't understand it.

1:20:53.683 --> 1:20:56.255
It's a birthday invitation.

1:20:58.292 --> 1:21:00.963
You're throwing him
a birthday party?

1:21:02.032 --> 1:21:06.133
A birthday party slash
concert slash wake.

1:21:06.630 --> 1:21:08.333
A little late for that,
isn't it?

1:21:10.436 --> 1:21:11.633
Yes, it is.

1:21:13.406 --> 1:21:14.911
Why send one to me?

1:21:16.607 --> 1:21:18.607
Because Simon would've
wanted you to be there.

1:21:19.280 --> 1:21:20.950
Oh, I see.

1:21:20.985 --> 1:21:24.415
And when did, uh, Simon's
wishes become important?

1:21:27.354 --> 1:21:29.090
-Bev.
-Simon would've

1:21:29.125 --> 1:21:31.961
wanted me
to know my granddaughter.

1:21:31.996 --> 1:21:33.259
I made a mistake.

1:21:35.659 --> 1:21:40.002
No, buying twin sheets for
a queen-sized bed is a mistake.

1:21:40.037 --> 1:21:42.598
Skipping
your husband's funeral,

1:21:42.633 --> 1:21:46.140
abandoning
his one living relative,

1:21:46.175 --> 1:21:49.605
not allowing his mother
to know her own grandchild

1:21:49.640 --> 1:21:52.344
when that is all
she has left in this world,

1:21:52.379 --> 1:21:54.984
that is not a mistake.

1:21:55.019 --> 1:21:56.579
That is an abomination.

1:21:56.614 --> 1:21:58.317
Allowing you to know her?

1:21:58.352 --> 1:21:59.582
You know where we live.
You could've just--

1:21:59.617 --> 1:22:00.616
Hey, Carey.
Free sample?

1:22:00.651 --> 1:22:02.255
Um...

1:22:02.290 --> 1:22:04.191
no, I'm--
I'm sorry-- no thanks.

Oh, no.

1:22:13.400 --> 1:22:15.037
I'm not gonna do this.

1:22:17.140 --> 1:22:18.700
You-- you knew
where to find us.

1:22:19.406 --> 1:22:21.010
-Why didn't you just--
-Don't you dare...

1:22:21.540 --> 1:22:23.012
put this on me.

1:22:30.318 --> 1:22:31.383
I'm sorry, I...

1:22:32.353 --> 1:22:35.090
I-- I-- I was in shock,
Bev, I...

1:22:37.259 --> 1:22:38.588
My son made a decision.

1:22:39.459 --> 1:22:40.656
I respected it.

1:22:40.691 --> 1:22:42.526
I understand that.

1:22:42.561 --> 1:22:44.132
Now that I'm a mother
I understand a lot of things--

1:22:44.167 --> 1:22:45.331
He was wrong.

1:22:45.828 --> 1:22:47.234
We were wrong.

1:22:50.437 --> 1:22:52.338
I wracked my brain
trying to figure this out.

1:22:55.112 --> 1:22:57.277
I guess
he was thinking that...

1:22:57.312 --> 1:23:00.214
well, he didn't wanna
ruin everything.

1:23:00.810 --> 1:23:02.315
He wanted...

1:23:02.350 --> 1:23:04.119
life with you
to stay the same.

1:23:05.089 --> 1:23:06.319
We--

1:23:06.354 --> 1:23:11.357
What you had
was rare and miraculous.

1:23:12.591 --> 1:23:14.657
Maybe he was afraid
to tarnish it.

1:23:29.212 --> 1:23:30.343
Here's your coffee.

1:23:34.382 --> 1:23:36.283
What I did to you
was unforgivable.

1:23:37.451 --> 1:23:38.846
I think I just...

1:23:40.883 --> 1:23:42.322
I...

1:23:43.226 --> 1:23:45.094
I needed someone to...

1:23:45.129 --> 1:23:46.326

1:23:48.627 --> 1:23:50.198

1:23:50.827 --> 1:23:52.200
So did I.

1:23:57.174 --> 1:23:59.108
I would like to meet
my granddaughter.

1:24:00.738 --> 1:24:03.244
You will. You can.
She knows all about you.

1:24:04.181 --> 1:24:05.444
-Oh, dear.

1:24:05.809 --> 1:24:08.183
She knows
that you're Daddy's mom

1:24:08.218 --> 1:24:11.318
and that you make
a world-famous pecan pie.

1:24:11.353 --> 1:24:13.749

1:41:29.720 --> 1:41:31.753
last but not least, uh...

1:41:32.624 --> 1:41:34.558
I would like
to thank Simon...

1:41:35.462 --> 1:41:38.595

into my life for 12 years.

he met for 37 years.

1:41:44.537 --> 1:41:46.141
Happy birthday, my love.

1:41:57.385 --> 1:41:59.550
[Simon exhales sharply

1:42:03.358 --> 1:42:04.720
Hey.

1:42:09.958 --> 1:42:12.728
Since when did you take
afternoon naps, old timer?

1:42:12.763 --> 1:42:13.861
Hm.

1:42:15.931 --> 1:42:18.173
I had a wicked headache.

1:42:18.571 --> 1:42:19.867
Wicked.

1:42:27.943 --> 1:42:29.415
Are you okay now?

today's headache damage

1:42:39.955 --> 1:42:41.757

1:42:52.275 --> 1:42:53.670
-Gretchen.
-Rachel.

1:42:54.574 --> 1:42:56.706
-Too tired to fight.

1:42:56.741 --> 1:42:58.411
Score!

1:43:11.690 --> 1:43:13.492
Well, if anything
ever happens to me--

1:43:13.527 --> 1:43:15.362
I'm not having
this conversation.

1:43:15.397 --> 1:43:17.331
I want you to take
a vow of celibacy.

1:43:21.667 --> 1:43:24.239
You are the love
of my life, you asshole.

1:43:24.769 --> 1:43:26.670
That's five dollars, please.

1:43:26.705 --> 1:43:30.003
It's in the kitchen,
and it's already full, so...

1:43:33.316 --> 1:43:34.612
I wouldn't want you
to be alone,

1:43:34.647 --> 1:43:35.811

1:43:41.390 --> 1:43:45.623
I swear I will never,
ever love anyone else.
