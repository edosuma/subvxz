<i> Corruption discovered
at the core of the Banking Clan!</i>

00:26.903 --> 00:29.572
<i>Reunited, Rush Clovis
and Senator Amidala</i>

00:29.614 --> 00:32.784
<i>discover the full extent
of the deception.</i>

00:32.826 --> 00:35.912
<i>Anakin Skywalker is sent to the rescue!</i>

00:35.954 --> 00:40.000
<i>He refuses to trust Clovis and
asks Padmé not to work with him.</i>

00:40.042 --> 00:44.004
<i>Determined to save the banks,
she refuses her husband's request,</i>

00:44.046 --> 00:47.757
<i>throwing their
relationship into turmoil.</i>

00:47.799 --> 00:50.844
<i>Voted for by both the
Separatists and the Republic,</i>

00:50.886 --> 00:55.224
<i>Rush Clovis is elected new leader
of the Galactic Banking Clan.</i>

00:55.265 --> 00:58.268
<i>Now, all attention is focused on Scipio</i>

00:58.310 --> 01:01.313
<i>as the important
transfer of power begins.</i>

01:25.379 --> 01:29.299
Welcome back to Scipio, Rush Clovis.

01:29.341 --> 01:32.219
Our Separatist government
has great hopes for you.

01:32.261 --> 01:35.055
Thank you, Senator.

01:35.097 --> 01:36.723
Only you and Senator Amidala

01:36.765 --> 01:39.309
will be allowed to monitor
the exchange proceedings.

01:39.351 --> 01:41.019
No forces on either side

01:41.061 --> 01:43.522
will be allowed
into the Neutral Zone.

01:43.564 --> 01:45.732
Senator Amidala,
we will be right here

01:45.774 --> 01:46.816
if you should need us.

01:46.858 --> 01:48.193
Thank you, Commander.

02:11.592 --> 02:14.177
It is with great
disappointment

02:14.219 --> 02:18.014
that I implement
the following verdict.

02:18.056 --> 02:20.476
By decree of the Muun people,

02:20.517 --> 02:23.562
the five representatives
standing before me

02:23.604 --> 02:26.273
are found guilty
of embezzlement.

02:26.315 --> 02:29.443
They shall be imprisoned
forthwith,

02:29.485 --> 02:32.654
and control of the banks
shall transfer immediately

02:32.695 --> 02:34.573
to Rush Clovis

02:34.615 --> 02:38.076
under the guidance
of the Muun government.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.253
We are grateful to you,
Clovis,

02:48.295 --> 02:51.632
for everything you have done
for the Muun people.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.342
To have lost the banks

02:53.383 --> 02:56.011
would have been
an historic disaster.

02:56.052 --> 02:57.513
I would like you to know

02:57.554 --> 02:59.848
I have no interest
in controlling the banks.

02:59.889 --> 03:02.934
I am simply here
to reestablish order.

03:06.896 --> 03:11.067
Do you think our friend
is up to the task?

03:11.109 --> 03:12.861
There are few men
I have met in my career

03:12.902 --> 03:15.696
who are more dedicated
to a cause than Clovis.

03:15.738 --> 03:17.866
Once he decides
what he is fighting for,

03:17.907 --> 03:20.369
little will stop him
from achieving it.

03:20.410 --> 03:22.538
Let us hope you are right

03:22.579 --> 03:24.914
for all our sakes.

03:44.351 --> 03:46.562
Ah, Clovis.

03:46.603 --> 03:49.189
How are you liking
your new office?

03:49.231 --> 03:53.068
I must say, you look very
comfortable behind that desk.

03:53.109 --> 03:56.112
Count Dooku,
what do I owe the pleasure?

03:56.154 --> 03:58.448
Come, come, my boy.

03:58.490 --> 04:00.950
You don't think I'd let
such an important day pass

04:00.992 --> 04:03.662
without wishing you
the best of luck.

04:03.704 --> 04:06.956
Thank you, but luck
has nothing to do with it.

04:06.998 --> 04:09.292
The transfer has occurred
without a hitch.

04:09.334 --> 04:11.044
Well, of course it has.

04:11.086 --> 04:14.464
The Separatists are fully
behind your appointment.

04:14.506 --> 04:19.469
After all, aren't we the ones
who put you there?

04:19.511 --> 04:21.137
For your support,
I am grateful,

04:21.178 --> 04:22.514
but I now must lead

04:22.556 --> 04:26.309
without allegiance
towards either side.

04:27.728 --> 04:29.605
Is that so?

04:29.646 --> 04:33.066
Quite the idealist you have become
in so short a time.

04:33.108 --> 04:35.527
What do you want, Dooku?

04:35.569 --> 04:37.738
To collect on my investment.

04:37.779 --> 04:39.656
How do you think the Republic
would like to know

04:39.698 --> 04:42.284
that it was I
who supplied Rush Clovis

04:42.325 --> 04:43.993
with all the information
he needed

04:44.035 --> 04:46.079
to topple the leaders of the bank?

04:46.121 --> 04:47.956
I will tell them myself.

04:47.997 --> 04:49.750
Oh, but you can't.

04:49.791 --> 04:51.834
I put you in power.

04:51.876 --> 04:54.337
You belong to me,

04:54.379 --> 04:56.172
and if you want to stay in control,

04:56.214 --> 04:57.882
you will do as I say.

04:57.924 --> 05:01.094
The banks will remain unbiased.

05:01.136 --> 05:02.887
Then I'm afraid the Separatists

05:02.929 --> 05:06.308
will be unable to pay
the interest on our loans.

05:06.349 --> 05:08.351
But the banks will collapse,
and then...

05:08.393 --> 05:11.896
Not if you raise
interest rates on the Republic.

05:11.938 --> 05:13.022
What?

05:13.064 --> 05:14.941
You know I can't do that.

05:14.983 --> 05:17.653
Oh, but you can,
and you will,

05:17.694 --> 05:20.489
or everything that you
fought so hard for

05:20.530 --> 05:22.407
will be destroyed.

05:36.171 --> 05:38.923
By the new order
of the Traxus Division

05:38.965 --> 05:41.301
and in an attempt
to stabilize the banks,

05:41.343 --> 05:44.513
it is essential that interest
rates on loans to the Republic

05:44.554 --> 05:46.973
be raised immediately.

05:47.015 --> 05:48.558
What?

05:48.600 --> 05:50.018
But you can't do that!

05:50.059 --> 05:51.770
Clovis.

05:51.812 --> 05:52.979
Clovis!

05:53.021 --> 05:55.023
What are you doing?

06:09.037 --> 06:10.747
This is an outrage!

06:10.789 --> 06:12.999
We warned you
this would happen!

06:13.041 --> 06:15.335
And what of the Separatists?

06:15.377 --> 06:16.837
From the little information

06:16.877 --> 06:19.631
Senator Amidala
has been able to establish,

06:19.673 --> 06:23.510
there will be no raise
on their current loan.

06:23.552 --> 06:27.138
I knew from the beginning
that Clovis would do this.

06:34.062 --> 06:36.356
Hmm, correct
you might have been

06:36.398 --> 06:37.774
about Clovis.

06:37.816 --> 06:39.234
It's incredibly foolish

06:39.275 --> 06:41.444
for to make a move like this
so early.

06:41.486 --> 06:44.531
He will turn the whole Republic
against him.

06:44.573 --> 06:47.659
Not clear to us
are his objectives.

06:47.701 --> 06:49.910
Want this he might.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.912
Something's wrong.

06:51.954 --> 06:53.540
This doesn't make sense.

06:53.582 --> 06:57.043
I would like to call for restraint

06:57.085 --> 07:00.839
and allow us time
to analyze the situation.

07:17.731 --> 07:19.858
You may begin your attack.

07:19.900 --> 07:22.527
It is time to make Rush Clovis

07:22.569 --> 07:24.905
look like a powerful Separatist.

07:24.946 --> 07:26.948
Right away, sir.

07:33.496 --> 07:35.039
It looks like
an invasion fleet, sir.

07:35.081 --> 07:37.083
We're caught out here
in the open.

07:41.755 --> 07:44.841
Get the men off this landing pad
and beyond the city gates!

07:56.185 --> 07:58.563
Senator Amidala, come in, please.

07:58.605 --> 08:00.398
What is it, Commander Thorn?

08:00.440 --> 08:02.609
We're under attack
by the Separatist garrison.

08:02.651 --> 08:04.360
Looks to be a full invasion.

08:04.402 --> 08:05.779
Invasion?

08:05.821 --> 08:07.363
We can't get to you.

08:07.405 --> 08:10.283
I suggest you get to a ship
as soon as you can.

08:14.370 --> 08:15.413
boom!

08:19.542 --> 08:20.794
Ahh!

08:33.765 --> 08:34.890
Let's move!

08:34.933 --> 08:36.183
Hurry!

08:59.875 --> 09:00.876
Ah!

09:04.504 --> 09:06.422
For the Republic!

09:09.509 --> 09:10.760
Ah!

09:39.455 --> 09:42.333
Our garrison has been attacked
by the Separatists,

09:42.375 --> 09:44.920
and it appears they are staging
an invasion of Scipio.

09:44.961 --> 09:46.379
An invasion?

09:46.421 --> 09:48.339
What do they hope to achieve?

09:48.381 --> 09:51.009
With this news, the Senate
will vote immediately

09:51.051 --> 09:52.385
to attack Scipio.

09:52.427 --> 09:55.388
It appears war has already
come to Scipio.

09:55.430 --> 09:57.599
I want you off that planet
immediately.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.100
I can't.

09:59.141 --> 10:01.436
Surely you can get
to a ship.

10:01.477 --> 10:04.731
General Skywalker,
I'm afraid I'm trapped.

10:08.401 --> 10:09.360
Let me go!

10:10.862 --> 10:12.864
Invoke an emergency meeting
of the Senate.

10:12.906 --> 10:14.866
There is no time to lose.

10:16.910 --> 10:18.411
I feel it is only right

10:18.453 --> 10:21.163
that you should handle
this matter, my boy.

10:21.205 --> 10:23.374
A lot will be entrusted to you.

10:31.591 --> 10:33.301
Don't touch me!

10:35.053 --> 10:36.054
What have you done to her?

10:37.346 --> 10:40.016
Clovis, what is going on?

10:40.058 --> 10:42.060
I didn't want this, Padmé.

10:42.102 --> 10:44.270
Why don't you tell her
what you did want

10:44.312 --> 10:47.107
and how you got it.

10:47.148 --> 10:48.441
Dooku.

10:51.778 --> 10:53.905
Padmé, this is not what it seems.

10:53.947 --> 10:56.240
Hasn't she joined our cause?

10:56.282 --> 10:59.327
Clovis here told me
how instrumental you were

10:59.368 --> 11:00.536
in getting him to power.

11:00.578 --> 11:01.579
If I had known...

11:01.621 --> 11:02.998
Either you are with us

11:03.039 --> 11:04.707
or you are against us.

11:04.749 --> 11:05.917
Arrest her!

11:05.959 --> 11:07.627
We can't do this, Dooku.

11:07.669 --> 11:10.296
The Separatist Senate
will never approve.

11:11.464 --> 11:12.465
Hey!

11:17.177 --> 11:18.721
No.
No.

11:18.763 --> 11:19.806
No!

11:21.766 --> 11:22.767
No!

11:24.853 --> 11:26.021
Are you insane?

11:26.062 --> 11:27.939
This was not part of the deal.

11:27.981 --> 11:29.440
What deal?

11:29.482 --> 11:31.442
What have you done here, Clovis?

11:31.484 --> 11:33.444
He's given us the banks.

11:33.486 --> 11:34.863
Gone are our debts,

11:34.904 --> 11:38.700
and gone is any credit
for the Republic.

11:38.741 --> 11:42.328
All of your idealism
was just a front.

11:42.370 --> 11:44.246
There was nothing I could do.

11:44.288 --> 11:48.084
Everyone has their price,
my dear.

11:55.091 --> 11:57.259
It is with grave news

11:57.301 --> 11:59.303
I come before you.

11:59.345 --> 12:02.557
Count Dooku and his
Separatist betrayers

12:02.598 --> 12:05.060
have manipulated us,
my friends.

12:05.101 --> 12:07.436
The war must go to Scipio!

12:07.478 --> 12:10.106
Clovis has been
their puppet of deceit

12:10.148 --> 12:14.360
as the Separatists are
currently invading Scipio.

12:14.402 --> 12:17.197
We must stop them
and secure the planet!

12:17.237 --> 12:20.324
We have handed
the entire economic system

12:20.366 --> 12:22.242
over to Count Dooku.

12:22.284 --> 12:23.912
We are doomed!

12:23.953 --> 12:25.080
Invade!

12:28.457 --> 12:31.669
As Supreme Chancellor,
I must abide

12:31.711 --> 12:34.130
by the consensus of the Senate.

12:34.172 --> 12:37.383
We shall commence
a mercy mission to Scipio

12:37.425 --> 12:41.303
to be led by
General Anakin Skywalker.

12:41.345 --> 12:45.100
The banks will be secured
at all costs,

12:45.141 --> 12:48.394
and the Republic
will not crumble!

12:50.105 --> 12:51.064
Victory!

12:51.106 --> 12:54.025
We will take victory.

12:54.067 --> 12:55.985
War on Scipio!

12:58.529 --> 13:00.823
Great emotions
you will find on Scipio,

13:00.865 --> 13:04.786
will you not?

13:04.827 --> 13:07.538
I am worried
for Senator Amidala.

13:07.580 --> 13:09.124
I'm afraid we may be too late.

13:09.165 --> 13:11.751
Correct you were
about Clovis,

13:11.793 --> 13:15.421
but let go of your selfishness
you must

13:15.463 --> 13:17.757
if you are to see clearly.

13:17.799 --> 13:21.469
Not all is as it seems.

13:21.510 --> 13:24.013
I understand, Master.

13:50.706 --> 13:54.002
Lord Tyranus,
the Republic fleet

13:54.043 --> 13:56.545
will be arriving shortly.

13:56.587 --> 13:58.214
Very good, my lord.

13:58.256 --> 14:01.050
Clovis has blindly
played his part.

14:01.092 --> 14:03.219
It now appears he coordinated

14:03.261 --> 14:06.222
the entire Separatist takeover.

14:06.264 --> 14:08.766
And because of this treachery,

14:08.808 --> 14:11.894
the banks will be firmly placed

14:11.936 --> 14:16.398
under the control
of the Supreme Chancellor.

14:29.370 --> 14:31.706
Why are you doing this?

14:31.747 --> 14:34.250
You wouldn't understand.

14:34.292 --> 14:36.127
I had to strike a deal
with Dooku,

14:36.169 --> 14:37.128
but don't worry.

14:37.170 --> 14:38.838
I am the one in control.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.589
As soon as things
have settled down,

14:40.631 --> 14:43.509
I can get rid of him,
and I'll control it all again.

14:43.551 --> 14:44.719
Listen to yourself.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.512
The Republic is sending
its armada

14:46.554 --> 14:48.306
to take back the banks.

14:48.348 --> 14:51.976
You've brought war
right where there cannot be war.

14:52.018 --> 14:53.602
Your actions
have destroyed the banks

14:53.644 --> 14:55.479
once and for all!

15:05.990 --> 15:08.951
Rex, have you gotten a fix
on Senator Amidala's position?

15:08.993 --> 15:11.662
We'll have a better lock
once we get near the city,

15:11.704 --> 15:14.290
but initial scans suggest
she's still alive, sir.

15:14.332 --> 15:15.833
Good.

15:15.875 --> 15:17.377
Hawk, we're gonna need
air support

15:17.418 --> 15:18.502
once we're on the ground.

15:18.544 --> 15:19.712
You'll have it, General.

15:19.754 --> 15:21.839
Me and the boys
are ready to fly.

15:57.708 --> 15:58.960
My Lord,

15:59.001 --> 16:01.337
we have fully engaged
Republic forces,

16:01.379 --> 16:03.839
but we are suffering
heavy losses.

16:03.881 --> 16:06.342
We have accomplished
what we came here for.

16:06.384 --> 16:08.261
It is time to withdraw.

16:08.303 --> 16:11.389
But sir, our forces
are still engaged

16:11.431 --> 16:13.599
in battle on the planet.

16:13.641 --> 16:14.976
Leave them.

16:15.017 --> 16:17.395
As you wish, Count Dooku.

16:34.412 --> 16:37.999
Sir, a Republic attack fleet
has just entered orbit

16:38.040 --> 16:39.417
and is approaching the city.

16:41.377 --> 16:43.087
Get me Count Dooku.

16:43.129 --> 16:46.507
It appears Count Dooku
has left the planet's surface.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.050
What?

16:48.092 --> 16:51.012
And the Separatist forces
are in full retreat.

16:51.053 --> 16:53.055
We are alone.

17:22.126 --> 17:24.503
Rex, hold
the droid forces here.

17:24.545 --> 17:26.255
I'm gonna push on and get Padmé.

17:26.297 --> 17:27.298
Copy that.

17:39.852 --> 17:42.604
Such plans I had.

17:42.646 --> 17:46.984
You know, I've spent so much
of my life misunderstood.

17:47.026 --> 17:49.195
What will they say about me now?

17:49.237 --> 17:51.489
What will I have left behind?

17:51.531 --> 17:54.534
Clovis, you have to
turn yourself in.

18:04.252 --> 18:05.961
It's over, Clovis.

18:17.181 --> 18:18.640
Stay away from me!

18:18.682 --> 18:20.268
I didn't do anything wrong!

18:20.309 --> 18:21.977
You have to believe me!

18:22.019 --> 18:24.355
You don't want to do this.

18:24.397 --> 18:26.107
You don't understand.

18:26.148 --> 18:27.649
You've all been deceived.

18:27.691 --> 18:29.068
Yeah, by you.

18:29.110 --> 18:30.236
No!

18:30.278 --> 18:31.279
By Dooku.

18:32.905 --> 18:34.407
I'm not the villain here.

18:34.449 --> 18:36.658
Tell him, Padmé.

18:36.700 --> 18:37.993
Let me go, Clovis.

19:18.075 --> 19:20.911
I can't hold both of you.

19:22.330 --> 19:23.956
Let me go.

19:23.998 --> 19:25.874
No, Anakin, don't.

19:30.087 --> 19:31.631
Try and climb.

19:34.091 --> 19:35.551
I am!

19:35.593 --> 19:37.386
I'm losing you!

19:38.387 --> 19:40.264
I'm sorry, Padmé.

19:42.016 --> 19:43.100
No.

19:57.281 --> 19:58.574
It's okay.

19:58.616 --> 19:59.783
You're okay.

19:59.825 --> 20:01.910
I'm sorry, Anakin.

20:01.952 --> 20:03.538
I'm sorry.

20:03.579 --> 20:05.331
It's over now.

20:05.373 --> 20:06.957
It's all over now.

20:12.213 --> 20:14.590
It is clear
to the Banking Clan

20:14.632 --> 20:17.885
it was Rush Clovis who was
behind the corruption

20:17.926 --> 20:20.346
that almost caused our collapse.

20:20.388 --> 20:22.515
In hope of a better tomorrow,

20:22.557 --> 20:25.184
we cede control of the banks

20:25.226 --> 20:29.188
to the office of the Chancellor
of the Galactic Republic.

20:32.191 --> 20:35.736
It is with great humility

20:35.777 --> 20:40.074
that I take on
this immense responsibility.

20:40.115 --> 20:43.411
Rest assured,
when the Clone Wars end,

20:43.452 --> 20:45.454
I shall reinstate the banks

20:45.496 --> 20:47.623
as we once knew them,

20:47.665 --> 20:51.669
but during these
treacherous times,

20:51.711 --> 20:54.296
we cannot in good conscience
allow our money

20:54.338 --> 20:56.340
to fall under the manipulations

20:56.382 --> 20:59.301
of a madman like Count Dooku

20:59.343 --> 21:01.429
or Separatist control again.

21:05.433 --> 21:09.645
May there be prosperity
and stability

21:09.687 --> 21:11.731
in all our Republic lands.

21:11.772 --> 21:16.485
May our people be free and safe.

21:16.527 --> 21:17.653
Long live the banks!

21:19.071 --> 21:20.664
<i>Long live the banks!</i>

21:20.906 --> 21:22.583
<i>Long live the banks!</i>

21:22.824 --> 21:24.668
<i>Long live the banks!</i>

21:24.910 --> 21:28.914
<i>Long live the banks!
Long live the banks!</i>

21:28.956 --> 21:30.750
<i>Long live the banks!</i>

21:30.791 --> 21:34.545
<i>Long live the banks!
Long live the banks!</i>
