to behead the 1%

05:30.760 --> 05:33.126
Five abductions
in the past 18 months,

05:33.160 --> 05:36.561
ransomed for hundreds
of millions of dollars.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.637
That's terrible,
but I seriously doubt
kidnapping rich kids

05:39.670 --> 05:42.559
is the plot against America

05:42.610 --> 05:46.137
Or perhaps it's a way
to finance something
more diabolical.

If their kids
had been abducted,
why didn't we know about it?

06:32.350 --> 06:34.159
Because they threatened to
kill them if they told anyone,

06:34.190 --> 06:35.657

in private.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.154
The first principle
of Shariah

09:56.190 --> 09:59.250
is the preservation
of human life.

09:59.290 --> 10:02.088
Does your work with him
save the lives of innocents?

10:02.130 --> 10:04.360
It did.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.698
Now I'm not so sure.

10:06.740 --> 10:10.301
Perhaps this question
is not about your employer,

10:10.340 --> 10:11.898
but about you.

10:13.710 --> 10:15.473
Perhaps you have begun
to wonder,

10:15.510 --> 10:18.206
is there more to life
than protecting him?

10:22.790 --> 10:26.317
There are many Jihads
in this world.

10:26.350 --> 10:28.955
But the hardest Jihad
you will ever fight

10:28.990 --> 10:31.049
is the one
with yourself.

10:31.090 --> 10:33.399
It is our prophet's ideal,

10:33.430 --> 10:36.297
peace be on him,

10:36.330 --> 10:39.697
to fulfill your oath,

10:39.740 --> 10:42.800
but not at the expense
of your soul

10:42.840 --> 10:45.161
or finding your
true intention in life.

10:47.140 --> 10:49.574
Is it self-glory

10:49.610 --> 10:52.579
or in defense
of a higher cause?

10:52.610 --> 10:56.273
If it is the latter,

10:56.320 --> 10:59.448
then you must always guard
the purity of your intention

I-I knew it the moment
I laid eyes on her.

She told me she was
from Saint Petersburg,

18:34.310 --> 18:38.679
uh, that she'd split with
her husband in her 405,

18:38.710 --> 18:41.372
came to America
to start over,

18:41.420 --> 18:43.285
and spent the rest
of her life here.

she had of her daughter,

18:59.970 --> 19:02.689
and that they'd had
a falling-out

19:02.740 --> 19:07.973
and that she hoped that they
would reconnect at some point.

19:09.710 --> 19:11.041

19:11.080 --> 19:13.571

19:13.620 --> 19:14.871
But they could have been.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.286
Virginia didn't talk
about it.

19:17.320 --> 19:19.641
She said
it was "too painful,"

19:19.690 --> 19:23.228
that, uh, the falling-out
that they had had

19:23.260 --> 19:25.182
was her "greatest regret."

Virginia wrote
her a letter.

any other letters,

19:36.470 --> 19:40.236

she was in hospice,

19:40.280 --> 19:42.339

to mail it.

clearing the air, I guess.

20:33.260 --> 20:35.057
Della Whitmore, the
pharmaceutical heiress.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.921
Apparently she spotted the car
loitering outside her mansion.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.995
Does she have kids?
22-year-old son.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.361
All right.
Text me the address.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.890
(BEEP)

20:42.940 --> 20:45.238
I'm sorry.
My apologies, Mr. King.

20:45.810 --> 20:47.232
Your wife, we believe

20:47.280 --> 20:50.579
she may have been running
from someone or something.

20:52.180 --> 20:55.047
If that's true,

20:55.080 --> 20:57.446
then I really
didn't know her.

21:02.590 --> 21:06.253
LIZ: Mrs. Whitmore,
I need you to tell us
exactly what they said.

21:07.630 --> 21:12.420
They said that they would
call us back with demands

21:12.470 --> 21:16.190
and that they'd kill him
if we didn't do as instructed.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.538
And you called the police?
They told us not to.

21:18.570 --> 21:22.006
This is a terrible situation,
but I have to tell you

21:22.040 --> 21:24.941
that the last person
whose son was taken

21:24.980 --> 21:27.710
refused to pay the ransom,
and his son was killed.

21:27.750 --> 21:30.048
They're all
too well aware of that.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.878
How are you
holding up, Dell?

21:32.920 --> 21:34.217
You okay?

21:34.260 --> 21:36.114
You know each other.
Marcus.

21:37.460 --> 21:39.849
These are the agents
I was telling you about.

21:39.890 --> 21:42.723
My son is dead
because of them.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.762
Please, I'm begging you.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.598
Do not listen to a word
they say to you.

21:55.280 --> 21:58.477
Excuse me. We're looking
for Noel Gerrick.

be better suited

22:18.130 --> 22:20.439
He used to come here
all the time as a kid.

22:20.470 --> 22:22.836
When he made
his first billion,
he bought the park.

22:22.870 --> 22:24.360
He loves this place.

And you are?

22:30.110 --> 22:31.771
Bored to tears.

22:31.810 --> 22:33.675
Tell me, why is it that
men your age feel the need

22:33.720 --> 22:37.019
to compensate for an
increasingly flaccid penis?

22:37.050 --> 22:38.642
It's only natural.

22:38.690 --> 22:41.079
So is cholera.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.850
I do hope you're not
the poor man's girlfriend.

22:43.890 --> 22:45.289
Don't be perverse.

22:45.330 --> 22:47.628
I'm much too old
to be his girlfriend.

22:47.660 --> 22:48.888
I'm his daughter.

22:49.730 --> 22:51.869
Well, aren't you
being a good sport.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.229
You shouldn't
go out there.

22:55.340 --> 22:57.035

don't compensate.

and poor taste.

23:04.380 --> 23:06.143

you gotta move.

23:06.180 --> 23:07.818
Let's say he's doing
about 100.

23:07.850 --> 23:11.445
The stopping distance
will be around 600 feet.

never think that fast.

23:28.270 --> 23:31.967
Just to be clear,
you want us to pay the ransom.

23:32.010 --> 23:34.570
Absolutely. These are
kidnappers, not killers.

23:34.610 --> 23:37.135
They killed my son.
I-I'm sorry, yes.

23:37.180 --> 23:38.807
And they will pay dearly
for that.

23:38.850 --> 23:41.318
But what I'm trying to say
is that everyone who has paid

23:41.350 --> 23:43.580
the ransom has gotten
their child back.

another child.

your payment.

difficult decision.

24:39.870 --> 24:43.909
I suspect you have an interest
in history, Noel.

24:43.950 --> 24:47.477
Did you know, shortly before
her date with the guillotine,

24:47.520 --> 24:50.785
Marie Antoinette had a chance
to escape from France?

24:50.820 --> 24:53.118
But she just couldn't bear
to travel like a commoner.

24:53.150 --> 24:55.914
She insisted on
a rosewood carriage

large enough for herself,

four footmen,

25:00.600 --> 25:01.999
and all of their luggage.

25:02.030 --> 25:04.191

was so decadent,

it could only go about
two miles per hour

25:06.500 --> 25:08.991
before breaking down
altogether.

25:11.670 --> 25:13.729
She could've
settled in London

25:13.780 --> 25:16.169
and eaten cake
for the next 50 years.

I'd love to hear more about,

then this enemy,

That's not gonna happen.
We're not going to storm in.

We're just gonna talk.
You and me.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.248
There's got to be
a way out of this,

31:00.290 --> 31:02.019
and I need you to help me
figure out what it is.

31:02.060 --> 31:03.982
Now tell me.
What is your name?

31:06.630 --> 31:08.655
He saw my face.
He can identify me.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.567
I think being identified
is the least of our concerns
right now.

31:13.400 --> 31:16.130
Listen. You have to let
Tyler Whitmore go. Not me.

31:16.170 --> 31:18.536
You can keep me here,
but the boy needs
to be set free.

31:18.570 --> 31:20.629
If you don't, they are
gonna swarm this building,

31:20.670 --> 31:22.535
and it'll be a show of force
unlike anything

31:22.580 --> 31:24.548
that you have
ever seen before.

31:24.580 --> 31:27.299
You don't have to let me go.
I can be your hostage.

31:27.350 --> 31:28.942
Me. I can be your hostage.

31:28.980 --> 31:32.143
But he's got to walk.
He's got to walk.

31:52.670 --> 31:55.377
Try something like that
again, and see if I
don't pull the trigger.

31:55.410 --> 31:57.173
If you let me help you...
Shut up, shut up!

31:57.210 --> 32:01.374
I saw What
you did to Des Foy.
I watched him die.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.445
And I saw What it's done
to his parents.

32:03.480 --> 32:07.644
I'm... I'm begging you.
Please. Come on.

32:07.690 --> 32:09.351
Don't do that.

32:09.390 --> 32:11.824

32:11.860 --> 32:13.225

to breach or not?

We are. Just waiting
on the go order.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.245
Which you do not have.

32:32.280 --> 32:33.770
If we go in,
the hostages will die.

32:33.810 --> 32:35.209
You don't know that.

32:35.250 --> 32:37.616
I know
they'll have no incentive
to keep them alive.

32:37.650 --> 32:39.186
If we keep negotiating,
they do.

32:39.220 --> 32:40.687
You've been negotiating
for almost an hour,

32:40.720 --> 32:42.210
and what do you have
to show for it?

32:42.260 --> 32:45.081
Absolutely nothing, because
there is nothing to negotiate.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.358
We're not letting them go,

32:46.390 --> 32:47.823
and they're not giving
the hostages up.

32:47.860 --> 32:49.191
You have to trust
the process.

32:49.230 --> 32:51.095
No.
Actually, I don't.

not take orders from you.

32:55.340 --> 32:57.934
You're not. You're taking
orders from her.

33:00.170 --> 33:02.775

33:04.910 --> 33:06.571

Will do anything for her,

including rolling tanks
on that warehouse

33:11.690 --> 33:14.454
if that's What it takes
to free her son.

he was never gonna
