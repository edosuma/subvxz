00:03.280 --> 00:07.119
Once upon a time, dinosaurs
ruled the world.

00:07.120 --> 00:09.200
But 66 million years ago...

00:11.200 --> 00:14.000
they vanished, virtually overnight.

00:15.560 --> 00:21.119
So what precisely happened in the
minutes, the days, the weeks

00:21.120 --> 00:25.559
that wiped out three-quarters of
the animal species on the planet?

00:25.560 --> 00:30.679
Many scientists now believe it
was the impact of an asteroid

00:30.680 --> 00:32.558
that caused their extinction.

00:32.560 --> 00:37.480
But nobody has been able to prove it...
until now.

00:39.840 --> 00:43.399
Evolutionary biologist Ben
Garrod and I have been granted

00:43.400 --> 00:46.959
exclusive access to a
multi-million-pound drilling mission

00:46.960 --> 00:50.399
into the exact point
where the asteroid hit.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.359
This really is one of the most
impressive science laboratories

00:53.360 --> 00:54.679
I've ever seen.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.519
Could the team's findings
about the asteroid

00:57.520 --> 01:00.880
finally solve the ultimate
dinosaur mystery?

01:02.600 --> 01:05.078
This is an absolutely amazing event -

01:05.080 --> 01:09.240
mountains the size of the
Himalayas were formed in seconds.

01:11.360 --> 01:13.679
With Ben at the impact site,

01:13.680 --> 01:16.279
I will be traveling across the world

01:16.280 --> 01:19.399
to look for evidence of
the events that followed.

01:19.400 --> 01:23.159
That is a bit of fossilized bone,

01:23.160 --> 01:25.759
and they're everywhere,
scattered across this hillside.

01:25.760 --> 01:27.079
It's just extraordinary.

01:27.080 --> 01:29.879
Armed with astonishing new revelations...

01:29.880 --> 01:33.959
Right here, we have the smoking
gun, and here, we have the bodies.

01:33.960 --> 01:37.119
We may finally be
able to paint a picture

01:37.120 --> 01:40.680
of the demise of the dinosaurs.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:03.200 --> 02:05.239
I'm off the coast of Mexico right now

02:05.240 --> 02:07.039
and this thing you can see behind me

02:07.040 --> 02:09.479
is a specially adapted drilling platform.

02:09.479 --> 02:12.519
Now, there's an international
team of scientists on board

02:12.520 --> 02:15.919
who are drilling far beneath
the seabed where we are now

02:15.920 --> 02:19.600
to look for evidence to see why
and how the dinosaurs died.

02:21.160 --> 02:23.839
This is the exact spot of
a huge asteroid strike

02:23.840 --> 02:29.479
that happened at precisely the same
time the dinosaurs were wiped out.

02:29.480 --> 02:33.479
This is Earth, 66 million years ago.

02:33.480 --> 02:35.119
Here's the asteroid.

02:35.120 --> 02:39.039
It's nine miles across
the size of a city.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.199
And here's the first surprising thing -

02:41.200 --> 02:42.679
the speed of it.

02:42.680 --> 02:45.359
It may not look that fast at this scale,

02:45.360 --> 02:50.360
but it was traveling an
unbelievable 40,000 miles an hour.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.239
Seen from the ground,

02:54.240 --> 02:58.279
it would have gone from a
mere dot in the sky to impact

02:58.280 --> 02:59.840
in a matter of seconds.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.159
The asteroid smashed into a shallow sea

03:07.160 --> 03:08.959
north of modern-day Mexico,

03:08.960 --> 03:11.480
exactly where the team
is starting to drill.

03:13.320 --> 03:18.719
The theory goes that this impact
set off a chain reaction of events

03:18.720 --> 03:20.120
that killed the dinosaurs.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.360
But here's the heart of the mystery...

03:27.400 --> 03:31.159
When you compare the size of
the asteroid and the Earth,

03:31.160 --> 03:33.919
well, the asteroid is comparatively small.

03:33.920 --> 03:37.639
It's like a grain of sand
hitting a bowling ball.

03:37.640 --> 03:41.479
So how did this asteroid
cause a mass extinction

03:41.480 --> 03:43.120
all around the globe?

03:44.920 --> 03:47.999
By extracting rock from the impact crater,

03:48.000 --> 03:50.480
the team hopes to find out.

03:54.520 --> 03:57.719
So, I'm not even strapped in, and
I don't especially like heights!

03:57.720 --> 03:59.560
But this is great, this is great.

04:02.600 --> 04:06.919
This multi-million-pound operation
has been decades in the planning

04:06.920 --> 04:09.880
and we're the only film
crew to have access.

04:12.360 --> 04:16.279
Professor Joanna Morgan first
proposed the operation.

04:16.279 --> 04:17.439
It's been a long wait.

04:17.440 --> 04:19.119
I've been excited for, you know,

04:19.120 --> 04:22.839
16 years, so to actually...
For it to be happening

04:22.840 --> 04:24.479
is quite scary.

04:24.480 --> 04:29.239
We've had so much effort between
us to get us to this point

04:29.240 --> 04:32.039
that... that you really
want some lovely results.

04:32.040 --> 04:35.399
Joining her on board to
co-direct operations

04:35.400 --> 04:37.319
is Professor Sean Gulick.

04:37.320 --> 04:41.199
So, this is the ultimate
test of some ideas, right?

04:41.200 --> 04:43.759
We have all these models about
how the extinction happened,

04:43.760 --> 04:46.399
but without some samples from ground zero,

04:46.400 --> 04:48.080
we can't really test them.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.759
This really is one of the most
impressive science laboratories

04:54.760 --> 04:57.119
I've ever seen, and it's an amazing place -

04:57.120 --> 04:59.000
we're going to have a quick look around.

05:02.320 --> 05:05.559
This central area here
is incredibly important.

05:05.560 --> 05:09.319
This is known as Main Street
by the crew and scientists.

05:09.320 --> 05:12.439
Now, these shipping containers
are actually science labs

05:12.440 --> 05:14.160
and, in each one...

05:15.560 --> 05:17.720
is a whole, entire laboratory.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.399
You can see in here huge
amounts of equipment.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.280
This is one of the scanning labs.

05:28.040 --> 05:30.039
But there are still lots
of personal touches.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.039
You can see where all the
different scientists

05:32.040 --> 05:33.639
and the rest of the crew are from.

05:33.640 --> 05:35.000
But my hometown's not on here!

05:39.560 --> 05:41.160
But this is the star of the show.

05:42.720 --> 05:48.159
This huge drill will bore
through 1.5km of solid rock,

05:48.160 --> 05:50.440
taking us back to the
time of the dinosaurs.

05:51.640 --> 05:52.959
This is the drill bit.

05:52.960 --> 05:56.399
Each one of these little nodules
is an industrial diamond.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.919
We've had this one modified
with a higher-speed head

05:58.920 --> 06:00.560
that allows us to core.

06:02.040 --> 06:06.279
Literally collecting a column
of rock three metres at a time

06:06.280 --> 06:09.199
and, as we go further down the borehole,

06:09.200 --> 06:11.599
we go further back in time,

06:11.600 --> 06:13.919
until we actually get to
the moment of the impact,

06:13.920 --> 06:15.560
about 66 million years ago.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.959
As Ben joins the team
drilling down into the rock

06:19.960 --> 06:22.279
for evidence of the asteroid's effects,

06:22.280 --> 06:26.320
I'm traveling the world to
look for clues from fossils.

06:28.520 --> 06:33.399
My first stop, 1,700 miles from the crater,

06:33.400 --> 06:34.879
is New Jersey.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.879
I'm here to see a mass
prehistoric graveyard

06:37.880 --> 06:41.080
unlike anything that's
been unearthed before.

06:43.240 --> 06:44.719
This disused quarry

06:44.720 --> 06:49.679
may be one of the most important
paleontological sites in the world.

06:49.680 --> 06:52.879
I'm here to view an intriguing discovery

06:52.880 --> 06:55.279
that may directly link the mass extinction

06:55.280 --> 06:58.839
to the asteroid impact.

06:58.840 --> 07:02.519
There's something very strange
about this mass extinction.

07:02.520 --> 07:07.879
So many animals died on that day,
and yet, it's virtually impossible

07:07.880 --> 07:11.559
to find casualties of
this devastating event.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.799
But palaeontologists here in New Jersey

07:14.800 --> 07:17.359
think they might have found just that -

07:17.360 --> 07:21.519
evidence of the day the dinosaurs died.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.839
It's such an extraordinary claim,

07:23.840 --> 07:27.120
I want to see exactly
what they've discovered.

07:30.280 --> 07:34.039
'I've arranged to meet
palaeontologist Kenneth Lacovara,

07:34.040 --> 07:35.999
'one of the most experienced -

07:36.000 --> 07:39.319
'and luckiest - fossil
hunters in the world.

07:39.320 --> 07:42.079
'He's going to show me where
the discovery was made,

07:42.080 --> 07:44.239
'in what used to be the seabed.'

07:44.240 --> 07:45.959
We're going back through time.

07:45.960 --> 07:49.039
We are. Now, if you take
one more step, Alice,

07:49.040 --> 07:50.519
you will be in the Cretaceous.

07:50.520 --> 07:51.919
Excellent.

07:51.920 --> 07:55.759
'As we descend into the quarry,
we arrive at layers of sediment

07:55.760 --> 07:58.519
'that were deposited during
the Cretaceous period,

07:58.520 --> 08:01.119
'when dinosaurs ruled the Earth.'

08:01.120 --> 08:03.479
So, down here, we're in
the Cretaceous period.

08:03.480 --> 08:08.279
Here, we're in the Paleogene
period, after the Cretaceous.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.639
'The boundary between the two
periods marks the moment

08:11.640 --> 08:15.679
'that the dinosaurs went
extinct, 66 million years ago.'

08:15.680 --> 08:18.639
So, this is the boundary right here.

08:18.640 --> 08:22.479
No-one in the world has found
an in-place dinosaur fossil

08:22.480 --> 08:24.680
one centimetre above that line.

08:28.680 --> 08:33.438
The team uncovered a dense layer of
fossils right at this boundary line.

08:33.440 --> 08:36.879
It's potentially a unique discovery.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.399
Dinosaurs.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.799
No dinosaurs.

08:39.799 --> 08:42.198
Gosh, that's extraordinary.

08:42.200 --> 08:48.079
'The animals found here are
typical of the late Cretaceous.'

08:48.080 --> 08:52.079
- That's a formidable-looking tooth.
- It is, isn't it? - Yeah.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.919
What's that from?

08:53.920 --> 08:56.000
This is from a mosasaur.

08:58.360 --> 09:02.159
Mosasaur's a giant marine
reptile, an apex predator.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.799
Think of a Komodo dragon
that's as long as a bus,

09:04.800 --> 09:06.439
with paddles for limbs,

09:06.440 --> 09:09.639
a two-meter jaw packed full of these teeth.

09:09.640 --> 09:14.199
We find mosasaurs here below our
bone bed and in the bone bed.

09:14.200 --> 09:17.319
We never find mosasaurs above the bone bed

09:17.320 --> 09:19.920
because they go extinct
along with the dinosaurs.

09:21.680 --> 09:24.679
Ken believes that the
mosasaurs he's found here

09:24.680 --> 09:27.480
may be some of the last that ever lived...

09:28.800 --> 09:32.480
and that they died as part
of the great extinction event.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.599
To understand why,

09:36.600 --> 09:40.520
we have to look at the other fossils
that Ken has found in the quarry.

09:45.440 --> 09:48.200
- This is incredible, Ken!
- HE LAUGHS

09:50.000 --> 09:51.879
Look at all those fossils.

09:51.880 --> 09:53.839
- 25,000 of them.
- SHE GASPS

09:53.840 --> 09:57.439
The way you've laid them out in this
grid, is this as you found them?

09:57.440 --> 09:59.839
These are the places in which
we've found them, yep.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.959
- 170 square metres of them.
- SHE GASPS

10:01.960 --> 10:05.479
It's an astonishing amount of work.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.519
All these fossils occur in a layer

10:07.520 --> 10:10.399
that's no more than ten centimetres thick.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.079
'For Ken, the first clue
that these animals all died

10:13.080 --> 10:15.479
'in a single catastrophic event

10:15.480 --> 10:20.439
'is that the skeletons are largely
intact with no teeth marks on them.'

10:20.440 --> 10:22.839
They weren't transported,
they weren't scavenged,

10:22.840 --> 10:25.839
they died suddenly and
they were buried quickly.

10:25.840 --> 10:29.479
That tells us that this is a
moment in geological time

10:29.480 --> 10:33.799
that's days, weeks, maybe months,
but this is not thousands of years,

10:33.800 --> 10:35.999
this is not hundreds of thousands of years.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.240
This is, essentially,
an instantaneous event.

10:39.960 --> 10:44.759
'A second clue comes from the
surprising mix of species

10:44.760 --> 10:47.759
'that had lived in many
different environments.'

10:47.760 --> 10:51.239
I mean, I can pick out large vertebrates.

10:51.240 --> 10:53.559
Sure. We see the occasional bird here.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.599
There's a tibia from a crocodile.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.799
And that's laying next to a
piece of the outer shell

10:58.800 --> 10:59.999
of a huge sea turtle,

11:00.000 --> 11:03.680
something that would be maybe
a meter-and-a-half across.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.679
'And just a few feet away,

11:06.680 --> 11:10.279
'Ken found another turtle from a
different part of the ocean.'

11:10.280 --> 11:13.959
This is a coastal-living turtle.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.839
You can see how tightly articulated it is.

11:16.840 --> 11:19.639
The shell doesn't flex, so
we know that this turtle

11:19.640 --> 11:21.719
didn't dive deeply in the ocean.

11:21.720 --> 11:24.319
This animal was living around the
coast, in the shallow water.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.359
So, what do you think you've got here?

11:26.360 --> 11:28.239
All this stuff died suddenly,

11:28.240 --> 11:30.199
and was buried all at about the same time,

11:30.200 --> 11:32.639
so that means all the stuff
that comes in from the coast

11:32.640 --> 11:34.559
has to come in suddenly.

11:34.560 --> 11:39.239
And that tells us that there is an
environmental disturbance going on

11:39.240 --> 11:41.520
on the coastline, up-shore from here.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.079
Whatever was the cause,

11:44.080 --> 11:46.519
this calamity that wiped out these animals,

11:46.520 --> 11:48.719
it was happening in the deep water,

11:48.720 --> 11:50.559
it was happening along the coastline,

11:50.560 --> 11:51.920
and it's happening on land.

11:56.440 --> 12:00.559
Ken's theory is controversial,
but if he's right,

12:00.560 --> 12:03.959
this could be the first fossil evidence

12:03.960 --> 12:08.840
of a sudden mass death event at
the end of the Cretaceous...

12:11.000 --> 12:18.240
right at that point in time when
75% of life on Earth is wiped out.

12:20.040 --> 12:24.319
But what caused this mass death event?

12:24.320 --> 12:27.919
Could all these animals have been
killed by the impact of an asteroid

12:27.920 --> 12:32.159
1,700 miles away in the Gulf of Mexico?

12:32.160 --> 12:35.999
Ben is with the scientists who
have been drilling into the seabed

12:36.000 --> 12:38.399
above the asteroid crater.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.599
I'm here, right in the middle
of the drilling platform,

12:41.600 --> 12:44.240
and there's a fresh core about to come out.

12:46.440 --> 12:50.160
We've already drilled through 500
metres of limestone sediment.

12:51.280 --> 12:54.119
Now, we're going to start
to bring up rock core

12:54.120 --> 12:59.039
for the scientists to examine as we
get closer to the impact crater.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.399
This is the first full
core of the expedition,

13:01.400 --> 13:03.519
we're excited to say.

13:03.520 --> 13:06.719
The first full, three-meter-long core,

13:06.720 --> 13:07.919
some light layers.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.879
We're wondering if they're
ashes or something.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.079
We're pretty excited.

13:11.080 --> 13:13.479
This, along with other
core samples like it,

13:13.480 --> 13:15.559
can tell the team so much information

13:15.560 --> 13:18.280
about what was going on at
the time of the impact.

13:20.520 --> 13:23.359
The first thing the team
does with each new core

13:23.360 --> 13:25.600
is find out how old the rock is.

13:27.400 --> 13:31.439
Exactly what's living,
exactly what fossils we find

13:31.440 --> 13:32.919
tell us what age we are.

13:32.920 --> 13:35.519
As soon as the core comes up on deck,

13:35.520 --> 13:37.959
we are given a small crumb of material,

13:37.960 --> 13:41.359
we take it back to the
lab and give an age call

13:41.360 --> 13:44.520
within five minutes of the
core appearing on the deck.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.519
I just got some sweet pictures.
Look at this crystal -

13:49.520 --> 13:52.599
this is the same stuff from the
core catcher under the microscope.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.840
Look at these crystals.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.999
Though it contains valuable information,

13:58.000 --> 14:01.519
this core isn't from the
impact crater itself.

14:01.520 --> 14:05.279
Instead, it's from the
layers of sediment above it.

14:05.280 --> 14:09.839
The team needs to drill a further
130 metres down into the sediment

14:09.840 --> 14:11.800
to get to the crater itself.

14:13.840 --> 14:17.239
The further down they go,
the harder the rock is,

14:17.240 --> 14:20.920
so that means weeks of
24-hours-a-day drilling.

14:23.360 --> 14:26.719
They want to pull core from
an area of the inner crater

14:26.720 --> 14:29.159
called the peak ring,

14:29.160 --> 14:32.080
found only in the largest of super craters.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.719
They're formed when the
massive impact of an asteroid

14:38.720 --> 14:42.159
forces rock to erupt in a central uprising,

14:42.160 --> 14:46.200
which then collapses outwards to
form the distinctive peak ring.

14:47.920 --> 14:51.079
It's these rocks that contain
the clues to what happened

14:51.080 --> 14:53.160
in the moments after impact.

14:59.800 --> 15:04.079
It's been three weeks since the team
started drilling into the seabed

15:04.080 --> 15:06.839
and time and money are running short.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.239
We didn't sample that because
it's in the middle of a core.

15:09.240 --> 15:12.999
The drill is nearly through the
hundreds of metres of limestone

15:13.000 --> 15:15.559
that has built up since
the asteroid struck,

15:15.560 --> 15:18.280
approaching rock layers
from the day of impact.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.839
I mean, look at this on the microscope.

15:21.840 --> 15:27.919
I would say somewhere between
about 64.5 million years ago

15:27.920 --> 15:31.079
and 63.5.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.119
Wow.

15:32.120 --> 15:36.479
- Wow, so this was E4...
- Yup. - ..Which is 53 million.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.599
Now we are 63, so we have 10 million.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.639
Yeah, that sounds like a good estimate,

15:41.640 --> 15:44.679
- so 10 million years in three metres.
- In three metres.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.519
We've been stuck in the
same zone for a while,

15:46.520 --> 15:48.799
going forward very slowly,
and then all of a sudden...

15:48.800 --> 15:51.359
- HE CLICKS HIS FINGERS
- ..boom, big jump in time.

15:51.360 --> 15:55.279
The team are noticing clues
in the latest cores -

15:55.280 --> 15:56.880
something extraordinary.

15:59.120 --> 16:02.079
But as you go down, it's just
more and more and more of it.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.999
It's got this greenish tint.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.999
Yeah, there's one right there.

16:06.000 --> 16:12.479
We've now had four cores
of ever-coarsening sands.

16:12.480 --> 16:15.080
I think the only process on Earth
that can do that is a tsunami.

16:18.520 --> 16:23.479
Tsunamis are huge, turbulent waves
that rip material from the seabed.

16:23.480 --> 16:24.959
When the wave passes,

16:24.960 --> 16:30.279
the material is deposited back on
the ocean floor in size order.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.959
The heaviest, most coarse
sand settles first,

16:33.960 --> 16:36.519
the finer sand on top.

16:36.520 --> 16:39.560
The thicker the deposit,
the bigger the tsunami.

16:43.280 --> 16:46.039
And the fact it's already,
like, 12 metres thick

16:46.040 --> 16:48.399
probably already makes
it one of the largest,

16:48.400 --> 16:50.639
maybe the largest tsunami
deposit ever discovered.

16:50.640 --> 16:53.959
And if it keeps getting thicker
as we go, it will absolutely,

16:53.960 --> 16:57.799
unquestionably, be the largest
tsunami deposit ever discovered.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.359
And, of course, it's right here
in ground zero of the impact.

17:00.360 --> 17:04.999
It's the first major clue of how
the impact of this asteroid

17:05.000 --> 17:07.759
could have caused a deadly chain of events,

17:07.760 --> 17:11.720
starting with the biggest
tsunami in history.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.239
1,700 miles away in New Jersey,

17:16.240 --> 17:18.799
Ken Lacovara has also picked up evidence

17:18.800 --> 17:21.920
of what could have been a tsunami.

17:23.640 --> 17:27.398
After that asteroid hit, it's
just chaos on the continent.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.599
There are tsunami waves lapping
up against the continent.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.239
You're going to have trees
floating down the estuaries.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.799
You're going to have
sediment choking the rivers.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.239
And that's exactly what we see there.

17:38.240 --> 17:41.479
Here in our fossil bed, we get
a mixture of marine organisms

17:41.480 --> 17:43.879
and organisms that came in from the land.

17:43.880 --> 17:46.880
One of our more common fossils is wood.

17:50.160 --> 17:52.559
In the Gulf of Mexico, the
crew are on the verge

17:52.560 --> 17:55.799
of breaking into the
asteroid impact crater,

17:55.800 --> 17:59.000
but, at the worst possible
moment, they've hit a roadblock.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.919
So they just woke me up because there's

18:02.920 --> 18:04.719
a problem with the drilling.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.319
We don't know if it's snapped or
if it just got stuck a little bit.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.199
We don't know, but they
have to bring it back

18:09.200 --> 18:11.919
to the surface to take a look.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.479
As they get nearer the crater,

18:13.480 --> 18:15.839
the rock is getting tougher to penetrate,

18:15.840 --> 18:17.999
and that's causing problems with the drill.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.359
TOOL BUZZES

18:19.360 --> 18:21.919
Getting to the point where
you start pushing the drill

18:21.920 --> 18:24.839
beyond its capacity, and
right now, there's no...

18:24.840 --> 18:28.000
There's no drilling rods, no
bit, no anything in the hole.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.079
While the engineers fix the rig,

18:33.080 --> 18:36.839
the scientists lose valuable drilling time.

18:36.840 --> 18:39.319
Behind me, you'll notice
the rig is not moving.

18:39.320 --> 18:41.319
SPARKS CRACKLE

18:41.320 --> 18:44.320
The pump that allows it to
turn is actually broken.

18:46.840 --> 18:49.479
RUMBLING

18:49.480 --> 18:51.320
We're in a bit of a race against time now.

18:54.280 --> 18:56.640
We're going to struggle
to get to 1,500 metres.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.359
So we're all hopeful -

19:00.360 --> 19:02.879
fingers, toes and so on are crossed -

19:02.880 --> 19:04.480
and we'll see how this goes.

19:08.840 --> 19:11.239
Finally, after a month of drilling,

19:11.240 --> 19:14.320
the team are pulling rock from
the asteroid crater itself.

19:16.160 --> 19:19.039
Already, they're seeing
evidence of the incredible heat

19:19.040 --> 19:21.239
generated by the impact -

19:21.240 --> 19:23.079
rock that has melted.

19:23.080 --> 19:24.319
And look at...

19:24.320 --> 19:27.999
In this part, it is very clear that
we have different kinds of colours,

19:28.000 --> 19:29.319
like this red color.

19:29.320 --> 19:32.319
It goes from green to red...

19:32.320 --> 19:34.479
- I think it's melting the material.
- Melted... - Yeah.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.639
- What about this?
- I think that is a big cluster melt.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.999
That does, too. Look at that.
That looks like the suevite.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.879
And we are now fully into
impact rocks directly,

19:41.880 --> 19:45.279
and it's really easy to
see, because it's granite,

19:45.280 --> 19:51.159
and so you can see these spotted,
leopard-looking big chunks.

19:51.160 --> 19:52.839
So, in effect, you know,

19:52.840 --> 19:55.880
these were formed, you know, on
the days that the dinos died.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.999
Quite heavy, these, aren't they?

20:00.000 --> 20:03.679
Yeah, you really appreciate just...
just how solid this rock is.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.599
How deep have you gone with this so far?

20:05.600 --> 20:09.159
We've got to just 1,330 metres, about that.

20:09.160 --> 20:11.959
So, we were hoping to get 1,500 metres,

20:11.960 --> 20:14.959
but we've got 700 metres
of peak ring materials,

20:14.960 --> 20:16.639
so we're pretty happy.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.199
Why couldn't you get 1,500?

20:18.200 --> 20:19.679
SHE LAUGHS

20:19.680 --> 20:21.359
Cos... cos the budget ran out.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.759
Oh, no!

20:22.760 --> 20:25.639
I'm dying to ask the question
that I wanted to know as a kid -

20:25.640 --> 20:26.959
where's the asteroid?

20:26.960 --> 20:30.039
- Yes, a lot of people think I'm going
to find the asteroid... - Yeah.

20:30.040 --> 20:31.839
And ask me that question a lot.

20:31.840 --> 20:35.519
Something like 95 or more percent
of the asteroid is vaporized.

20:35.520 --> 20:39.639
- Mm-hm. - So, in fact, there's
hardly any asteroid here

20:39.640 --> 20:41.359
beneath the surface.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.119
The asteroid material has been, sort of,

20:43.120 --> 20:44.719
spread all around the globe,

20:44.720 --> 20:48.399
so it's been ejected way above
the Earth's atmosphere,

20:48.400 --> 20:51.600
traveled round the globe,
and landed around the Earth.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.880
After eight weeks, the work here is done.

20:58.920 --> 21:00.799
I don't think it could
have gone much better.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.159
I'll not forget this place.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.999
It's been an amazing expedition,
and I expect we'll have lots more

21:06.000 --> 21:08.039
discoveries to come.

21:08.040 --> 21:10.959
More than 300 rock cores
have been extracted,

21:10.960 --> 21:15.320
which the team hopes will tell the
story of how the dinosaurs died.

21:34.040 --> 21:37.479
Four months and over 5,000 miles later,

21:37.480 --> 21:39.119
the rock cores are now here

21:39.120 --> 21:42.239
at the University of Bremen in Germany,

21:42.240 --> 21:43.679
for the second phase

21:43.680 --> 21:47.679
of this colossal and
unparalleled scientific journey.

21:47.680 --> 21:51.759
I'm inside a huge fridge that's
now home to all the samples that

21:51.760 --> 21:54.479
were taken up from the Gulf of Mexico,

21:54.480 --> 21:57.359
and it's really cold in
here, as you might expect.

21:57.360 --> 22:00.839
Now, this is to stop any
organisms from growing

22:00.840 --> 22:02.880
and contaminating these samples.

22:05.520 --> 22:09.159
This is a test recording. Say something.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.039
Oh. Hello, hello.

22:11.040 --> 22:15.119
Here in Bremen, the research team is
working to find out what happened,

22:15.120 --> 22:18.519
minute by minute, after
the asteroid struck,

22:18.520 --> 22:20.880
and what that meant for the dinosaurs.

22:23.480 --> 22:26.879
OK, this is day two that
we've had the samples,

22:26.880 --> 22:30.599
and I'm going to take you through the...
around the labs

22:30.600 --> 22:32.879
where everybody's started their analysis.

22:32.880 --> 22:35.639
Over here we can see people
looking through microscopes,

22:35.640 --> 22:38.239
looking at thin slides that have
been collected from offshore.

22:38.240 --> 22:41.799
Hi, Philippe. I'm going to film you
while you take a look at this core.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.440
Hey!

22:47.160 --> 22:50.839
Unraveling these cores is a mammoth task.

22:50.840 --> 22:55.079
Over 800 metres of rock has
to be carefully split,

22:55.080 --> 22:56.840
tested and photographed.

23:00.240 --> 23:03.359
But what they're starting to reveal
about the force of the impact

23:03.360 --> 23:05.200
is literally earth-shattering.

23:09.160 --> 23:13.919
This core, from above the crater, is
what typical geology looks like -

23:13.920 --> 23:17.119
layer upon layer of similar-looking rock,

23:17.120 --> 23:20.200
laid down on the seabed very slowly.

23:21.800 --> 23:26.320
This three metres of limestone took
millions of years to accumulate.

23:28.720 --> 23:30.560
But when the asteroid struck...

23:32.920 --> 23:34.960
it was geology at hyper-speed.

23:37.560 --> 23:43.639
The next 600 metres of rock
were deposited in a single day,

23:43.640 --> 23:46.960
leaving a unique and chaotic jumble.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.999
Sean, I mean, how do you make
sense of this incredible place

23:56.000 --> 23:57.479
- that you've got here?
- It is amazing.

23:57.480 --> 24:00.039
This is 150km worth of core,

24:00.040 --> 24:02.519
collected by the International
Ocean Discovery Program

24:02.520 --> 24:04.959
- and all its predecessors back
to the late '60s. - Mm-hm.

24:04.960 --> 24:06.039
But from all these cores,

24:06.040 --> 24:08.319
- the most amazing is the one
we just collected... - Yeah.

24:08.320 --> 24:10.439
- In the Chicxulub impact crater.
- Of course, yeah.

24:10.440 --> 24:14.159
You can see this black,
flowing texture of the rock.

24:14.160 --> 24:15.279
This is actually...

24:15.280 --> 24:18.039
- It looks like it flowed, right?
- Mm. - You can see the textures in it.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.159
This is actually melted basement rock,

24:20.160 --> 24:24.519
melted granite, and it actually
takes amazing pressures to do that,

24:24.520 --> 24:26.319
and amazing pressures to melt the rock.

24:26.320 --> 24:27.519
This is...

24:27.520 --> 24:29.839
So I've got a piece of what
would be considered, sort of,

24:29.840 --> 24:31.199
normal granite, if you will -

24:31.200 --> 24:34.319
the kind that you might
put on your counter-top,

24:34.320 --> 24:36.239
and that's why we use it,
cos it's nice and hard.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.199
- I mean, it... Right?
- Pretty solid.

24:38.200 --> 24:39.799
But this... Yeah, exactly.

24:39.800 --> 24:44.119
This stuff has actually seen
shock of an incredible level,

24:44.120 --> 24:47.679
so think of it as pressure waves
moving down through the granite,

24:47.680 --> 24:50.119
like lots and lots of little earthquakes.

24:50.120 --> 24:51.279
And what it's done to it is,

24:51.280 --> 24:53.399
all the way down at the scale of a crystal,

24:53.400 --> 24:55.359
- is it's actually deformed it...
- Mm-hmm.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.960
So that the final granite...

24:59.000 --> 25:00.159
can be broken.

25:00.160 --> 25:02.399
- It just crumbled up. That's...
that's amazing. - Yeah.

25:02.400 --> 25:07.559
Oh, wow. Just such incredible,
amazing forces at work here.

25:07.560 --> 25:10.479
This whole event, it's... I'm
still finding it difficult.

25:10.480 --> 25:13.159
Well, even as a geophysicist,
where we study this for a living,

25:13.160 --> 25:15.999
it's really hard to wrap our
brains around the enormity of

25:16.000 --> 25:18.519
the pressures involved, and the
enormity of the destruction

25:18.520 --> 25:21.959
- that happens in the middle of an
impact, and so quickly. - Mm-hm.

25:21.960 --> 25:24.000
This all happened in less than ten minutes.

25:25.760 --> 25:29.719
It's becoming clear just
how mind-bogglingly huge

25:29.720 --> 25:31.400
the Yucatan impact really was.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.719
And to help grasp its scale,

25:35.720 --> 25:40.080
Sean is taking a trip to a more
recent impact site in Arizona.

25:48.720 --> 25:53.719
This simple crater here was created
by about a 50-meter, or 150-foot,

25:53.720 --> 25:56.480
asteroid impacting the Earth,
about 50,000 years ago.

25:57.800 --> 26:00.839
It's about a mile across.
It's actually quite small.

26:00.840 --> 26:03.159
It's basically, simply,
a bowl-shaped crater.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.839
Everything above the red line
that you see there is actually

26:05.840 --> 26:09.519
material that used to be buried
that has been flipped up on end,

26:09.520 --> 26:11.559
and is now... or flipped upside-down,

26:11.560 --> 26:14.360
and is now laying as a pile
of broken-up material.

26:16.200 --> 26:19.719
By studying the shape of the crater
and the upheaval of the rock layers,

26:19.720 --> 26:22.879
Sean, Jo and the team can
compare this site to

26:22.880 --> 26:25.519
the Yucatan impact zone,

26:25.520 --> 26:28.119
Even a small asteroid strike like this

26:28.120 --> 26:31.399
would have had dramatic consequences.

26:31.400 --> 26:35.839
So it comes in at something like 26,000mph.

26:35.840 --> 26:39.079
10km away from here, we would
have a fireball reaching,

26:39.080 --> 26:42.079
maybe 20km away from here, a shock wave,

26:42.080 --> 26:45.399
and, say, 40km away from here
are hurricane-force winds,

26:45.400 --> 26:47.599
but that would just have been a bad day

26:47.600 --> 26:49.480
in, today, northern Arizona.

26:52.200 --> 26:55.719
So this is what a 50m-wide
asteroid can do -

26:55.720 --> 26:58.479
it's devastating, but localized.

26:58.480 --> 27:01.679
But what about an asteroid
that is nine miles across

27:01.680 --> 27:04.960
and leaves a crater 120 miles wide?

27:09.440 --> 27:11.599
To understand the effects of that impact,

27:11.600 --> 27:15.240
the team needs to know exactly
how much energy it released.

27:17.160 --> 27:20.919
To do that, they're comparing
rock samples from Yucatan

27:20.920 --> 27:27.000
to data gathered from some of the
largest ever man-made explosions.

27:33.840 --> 27:37.039
This is the Nevada Test Site,

27:37.040 --> 27:40.360
the most bombed place in the world.

27:42.800 --> 27:48.039
The US military have detonated
904 atomic bombs here.

27:48.040 --> 27:52.239
To help us understand how atomic
bombs connect to asteroids,

27:52.240 --> 27:53.559
we've enlisted the help

27:53.560 --> 27:56.280
of physicists Mark Boslough
and David Dearborn.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.719
The blast must have come
all the way through,

28:00.720 --> 28:02.199
and I bet these windows blew out.

28:02.200 --> 28:05.919
Those shards of glass would
be accelerated by 90mph wind.

28:05.920 --> 28:09.159
- Wind, the windows were gone. Yes.
- And they're totally... boom.

28:09.160 --> 28:12.799
This house was part of a test
village called Survival Town,

28:12.800 --> 28:15.760
built to study the effects
of a nuclear blast.

28:17.680 --> 28:22.919
It actually survived a blast
called Apple-2 in May 1965.

28:22.920 --> 28:24.959
EXPLOSION

28:24.960 --> 28:27.000
WIND HOWLS

28:28.600 --> 28:31.040
Most of the damage is
done by the fireball...

28:34.200 --> 28:38.800
and the heat that is generated,
or the blast wave as it goes by...

28:41.360 --> 28:43.600
and the houses that were
in closer didn't survive.

28:52.040 --> 28:54.559
Those of us who work on asteroid impacts,

28:54.560 --> 28:57.279
we naturally started comparing
them to nuclear explosions.

28:57.280 --> 28:59.040
It's a similar phenomenon.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.759
The experimenters had high-speed cameras,

29:02.760 --> 29:05.799
they had gauges that measured the
intensity of the shock wave,

29:05.800 --> 29:08.160
the blast wave in the air.

29:09.400 --> 29:12.639
The tests found that nuclear
explosions are devastating

29:12.640 --> 29:15.199
even at a microscopic level,

29:15.200 --> 29:19.760
causing catastrophic shock
to minerals such as quartz.

29:22.040 --> 29:25.839
The pressure is so high in a shock
wave from a nuclear explosion

29:25.840 --> 29:28.999
that it actually exceeds
the strength of a crystal.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.839
Crystal is made up of a
uniform array of atoms

29:32.840 --> 29:36.639
and that uniformity is completely
disrupted by a strong shock wave,

29:36.640 --> 29:38.880
and that's what shocked quartz is.

29:41.240 --> 29:44.319
In Bremen, Professor Joanna
Morgan is looking at quartz

29:44.320 --> 29:48.079
found in rock cores from
the asteroid impact site.

29:48.080 --> 29:52.039
From nuclear test data, she
knows exactly how much force

29:52.040 --> 29:55.039
it takes to shock quartz.

29:55.040 --> 29:58.599
From this, she can tell how
much force the Yucatan rock

29:58.600 --> 30:01.999
has been subjected to and begin
to calculate the exact amount of

30:02.000 --> 30:04.759
energy released when the asteroid struck.

30:04.760 --> 30:09.079
So this is a piece of shocked
quartz that we recently drilled

30:09.080 --> 30:10.559
from the Chicxulub impact crater.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.719
There's lots of lines here.

30:12.720 --> 30:15.599
Essentially, the more lines
we have on the screen,

30:15.600 --> 30:18.319
different directions, the more
shocked this rock has been.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.399
These are caused by the impact,

30:20.400 --> 30:22.839
by the shock wave that travels
through this piece of quartz.

30:22.840 --> 30:25.679
So we used exactly the same
hydro-codes, they're called,

30:25.680 --> 30:30.239
to model nuclear explosions as we
do to model the impact craters.

30:30.240 --> 30:34.119
We've actually stolen these codes
and applied them to our simulations

30:34.120 --> 30:35.519
of impact crater formation.

30:35.520 --> 30:37.599
What sort of force were
we actually talking about

30:37.600 --> 30:38.999
from the asteroid hitting it?

30:39.000 --> 30:42.359
This event was equivalent to
about 10 billion Hiroshima’s,

30:42.360 --> 30:45.159
so, absolutely enormous.

30:45.160 --> 30:48.119
The most dramatic event in
the last 100 million years.

30:48.120 --> 30:50.119
10 billion Hiroshima’s combined?

30:50.120 --> 30:52.479
- That's the amount of force
going into this? - Absolutely.

30:52.480 --> 30:53.840
It's incredible, it really is.

30:59.360 --> 31:01.639
Finally, we have hard evidence

31:01.640 --> 31:05.999
of just how powerful the
asteroid strike really was.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.039
10 billion Hiroshima’s.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.200
It's a major revelation.

31:12.400 --> 31:15.359
But the truly incredible thing
about this asteroid strike

31:15.360 --> 31:18.679
was that it changed the face
of our planet within seconds.

31:18.680 --> 31:21.039
And now we know that,

31:21.040 --> 31:24.000
we can do something that has
never been done before.

31:25.840 --> 31:29.639
'Create a simulation of exactly
how the impact affected Earth

31:29.640 --> 31:31.600
'and the dinosaurs.'

31:32.640 --> 31:36.559
Here's what the new results tell us
about those crucial initial minutes

31:36.560 --> 31:38.440
after the asteroid struck.

31:41.960 --> 31:44.159
The asteroid, nine miles wide,

31:44.160 --> 31:48.680
smashes into the Yucatan at 40,000mph...

31:57.640 --> 31:59.440
vaporizing instantly.

32:01.640 --> 32:08.479
The impact makes a hole in the earth
20 miles deep and 120 miles across,

32:08.480 --> 32:13.840
turning the surrounding sea to steam
and shattering the earth below.

32:14.840 --> 32:19.639
Rock from deep in the Earth's crust
then rises miles into the air,

32:19.640 --> 32:23.639
forming a tower higher than the Himalayas

32:23.640 --> 32:28.720
that collapses to form a strange
ring of peaks that exists today.

32:30.680 --> 32:33.480
All this in the first ten minutes.

32:35.800 --> 32:37.919
What did this mean for the dinosaurs?

32:37.920 --> 32:42.400
Well, it started an unstoppable
and devastating chain of events.

32:44.560 --> 32:47.719
First, like an enormous nuclear explosion,

32:47.720 --> 32:51.639
a radiation fireball
10,000 degrees centigrade

32:51.640 --> 32:54.240
spreads out from the impact zone.

32:56.680 --> 33:00.359
This searing hot sphere
fries everything within

33:00.360 --> 33:03.200
a 600-mile radius in an instant.

33:05.880 --> 33:10.359
The truly global devastation had
its roots not in the blast,

33:10.360 --> 33:12.079
but in the huge vapor plume

33:12.080 --> 33:15.680
that rose out of the crater
and through the atmosphere.

33:19.920 --> 33:24.279
A red-hot cloud of vaporized
asteroid and rock,

33:24.280 --> 33:27.239
expanding upwards 600 miles,

33:27.240 --> 33:31.880
spreading rapidly outwards to
fill the planet's atmosphere.

33:37.720 --> 33:41.400
Back then, faraway New
Jersey was covered in ocean.

33:45.880 --> 33:50.560
And it too would soon feel
the effects of the impact.

33:51.800 --> 33:55.439
1,700 miles from the site of the impact,

33:55.440 --> 33:58.079
the fireball wouldn't have been visible.

33:58.080 --> 34:01.479
That blazing, towering, swirling cloud

34:01.480 --> 34:03.799
would've been just over the horizon,

34:03.800 --> 34:06.399
but we might have seen a faint glow.

34:06.400 --> 34:10.840
The animals here were safe
from the direct radiation.

34:13.040 --> 34:15.039
Two-and-a-half hours later,

34:15.040 --> 34:17.759
like the sound of heavy
traffic in the distance,

34:17.760 --> 34:21.600
the shock wave, now a sound wave, arrived.

34:25.920 --> 34:29.438
Wind starts to whip up, growing
stronger and stronger until

34:29.440 --> 34:32.480
we're facing into hurricane-force winds.

34:38.199 --> 34:39.998
The blast wave from the impact

34:40.000 --> 34:42.800
surged across the Earth at enormous speed.

34:44.159 --> 34:47.759
Its effects would have been short-lived,

34:47.760 --> 34:50.399
but those few traumatic hours

34:50.400 --> 34:54.840
left an indelible impression in
the earth's geological record.

34:57.760 --> 35:02.959
These are beads of molten rock
that rained down from the skies

35:02.960 --> 35:04.839
and as they cool, they become glass.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.879
And if you melt rock and you cool it fast,

35:06.880 --> 35:10.079
it doesn't have a chance to turn
back into rock, it forms glass.

35:10.080 --> 35:11.319
Glass called spherules.

35:11.320 --> 35:14.439
And we find these little
spherules right here

35:14.440 --> 35:16.600
in this mass death assemblage.

35:19.400 --> 35:23.599
What produces the kind of
energy and heat needed

35:23.600 --> 35:26.039
to form these spherules, then?

35:26.040 --> 35:28.599
Well, when you have an asteroid impact,

35:28.600 --> 35:31.479
it melts the rock and it flies
up through the atmosphere

35:31.480 --> 35:34.599
and these bits of molten rock
rain down on the planet.

35:34.600 --> 35:39.039
'These 66-million-year-old
droplets of molten rock show that

35:39.040 --> 35:40.759
'debris was falling on landscapes

35:40.760 --> 35:43.319
'far away from the impact zone itself.'

35:43.320 --> 35:48.119
Protected by the water, marine
creatures like the mosasaurs

35:48.120 --> 35:51.679
may have been able to survive
these immediate events.

35:51.680 --> 35:54.799
But for the dinosaurs on
land, with nowhere to hide,

35:54.800 --> 35:57.320
this was the beginning of the end.

35:59.480 --> 36:01.999
To show how the effects
might have played out

36:02.000 --> 36:03.679
for dinosaurs on the ground,

36:03.680 --> 36:08.039
we've enlisted palaeontologists
Steve Brusatte and Tom Williamson

36:08.040 --> 36:09.479
to our international team.

36:09.480 --> 36:12.519
They've come to New Mexico,

36:12.520 --> 36:15.639
1,200 miles from the impact zone,

36:15.640 --> 36:19.599
hunting for remains in one of the
richest dinosaur fossil sites

36:19.600 --> 36:20.799
in the world.

36:20.800 --> 36:23.079
- Yeah. OK.
- Whoa.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.839
- Got a bone layer.
- Look at this. Check this out.

36:25.840 --> 36:29.399
A lot of times, we'll just be
walking around in the Badlands,

36:29.400 --> 36:32.279
looking for stuff that's
sticking out of the rock.

36:32.280 --> 36:34.879
That's always the first clue.

36:34.880 --> 36:37.439
This one's really sticking out.
We can tell from the shape of it

36:37.440 --> 36:39.320
that it's part of the
backbone of a dinosaur.

36:41.480 --> 36:45.479
It's a bone from the backbone
of a horned dinosaur.

36:45.480 --> 36:48.519
This is probably Pentaceratops,

36:48.520 --> 36:50.719
which means five-horned face,

36:50.720 --> 36:54.759
two brow horns, a nasal horn and
then a cheek horn on each side.

36:54.760 --> 36:57.159
Triceratops has three horns on its face.

36:57.160 --> 37:00.439
This guy had two more
horns, so five horns total,

37:00.440 --> 37:03.040
so an even gaudier dinosaur.

37:04.680 --> 37:08.319
The ceratopsians, like
Pentaceratops and Triceratops,

37:08.320 --> 37:11.919
were a large group of
plant-eating dinosaurs

37:11.920 --> 37:14.079
that roamed the American landscape

37:14.080 --> 37:17.680
for the 20 million years leading
up to the asteroid impact.

37:21.520 --> 37:24.000
- There it is.
- Pretty good. Look at that. - Not bad.

37:25.080 --> 37:26.719
This whole area here,

37:26.720 --> 37:29.479
honestly, it's littered
with these kind of bones.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.599
These were the cows of the Cretaceous,

37:31.600 --> 37:33.879
they would've been everywhere
on this landscape.

37:33.880 --> 37:38.959
66 million years ago, this area
would've looked very different.

37:38.960 --> 37:42.679
Today, it's known as the San Juan Badlands.

37:42.680 --> 37:45.040
Back then, it wasn't so bad at all.

37:46.920 --> 37:49.720
This whole area was a lush jungle.

37:51.120 --> 37:53.200
Dense vegetation.

37:55.200 --> 37:58.400
Thick forests cut through
by flowing rivers.

38:04.960 --> 38:09.799
When that day started, this whole
area here would've been teeming

38:09.800 --> 38:15.119
with dinosaurs, and then,
about 2,000km or so,

38:15.120 --> 38:19.240
1,200 miles in this direction to
the south-east, the asteroid hit.

38:29.120 --> 38:32.159
And very quickly, the
dinosaurs would've realised

38:32.160 --> 38:34.119
that something was wrong,

38:34.120 --> 38:38.519
because there would've been
an enormous red glowing cloud

38:38.520 --> 38:41.240
that would've filled up
much of the sky here.

38:42.920 --> 38:45.759
The glowing cloud would've looked dramatic,

38:45.760 --> 38:47.599
but this far from the impact zone,

38:47.600 --> 38:51.280
the dinosaurs here would've
been safe... for now.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.679
Now, their cousins down in Texas,

38:54.680 --> 38:58.119
about 1,000 kilometers
closer to the impact site,

38:58.120 --> 38:59.319
they were toast.

38:59.320 --> 39:01.279
They were incinerated, they were vaporized.

39:01.280 --> 39:04.519
By studying the Yucatan rock core,

39:04.520 --> 39:06.920
we know the exact timing
of what happened next.

39:08.520 --> 39:10.879
11 minutes after the impact,

39:10.880 --> 39:14.159
the vapor cloud arrived in New Mexico.

39:14.160 --> 39:19.440
The skies darkened and the
temperature started to rise.

39:23.320 --> 39:26.319
It wasn't really a case
of fire and brimstone

39:26.320 --> 39:27.959
raining down from the heavens.

39:27.960 --> 39:31.359
It was more a case of all of that
stuff heating up the atmosphere

39:31.360 --> 39:35.080
and turning the atmosphere
into a giant radiator.

39:40.720 --> 39:42.799
The heat was so intense that,

39:42.800 --> 39:45.159
over 1,000 miles away from the impact,

39:45.160 --> 39:48.160
many animals would have been roasted alive.

39:50.440 --> 39:52.799
Climate specialist Dr Brian Toon

39:52.800 --> 39:56.599
is the first scientist ever to
theories what happened next.

39:56.600 --> 40:03.439
A devastating global firestorm he's
studied for more than 20 years.

40:03.440 --> 40:08.359
It wasn't falling on you, it was
60km above the ground or so,

40:08.360 --> 40:13.479
and the glowing hot lava was
emitting an amount of energy

40:13.480 --> 40:16.320
that's a few times larger than the sun.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.359
This is not a normal fire.

40:20.360 --> 40:23.839
The fire was started everywhere,
which causes what's called

40:23.840 --> 40:25.680
a mass fire.

40:27.280 --> 40:31.319
Mass fires can be much
hotter than a normal fire.

40:31.320 --> 40:34.439
Well, the leaves on the ground caught fire,

40:34.440 --> 40:36.200
leaves in the trees caught fire...

40:38.120 --> 40:39.800
The underbrush caught fire.

40:42.280 --> 40:45.679
There's winds at hurricane
speeds rushing into the fire,

40:45.680 --> 40:49.319
drawing upward into the rising flames

40:49.320 --> 40:51.320
and they consume everything.

40:55.280 --> 40:58.639
And this vapor quickly
spread across the planet.

40:58.640 --> 41:00.279
Probably only took a few hours

41:00.280 --> 41:03.280
for it to reach the furthest
reaches of the Earth.

41:10.280 --> 41:14.279
Thanks to our new model of what
happened after the impact,

41:14.280 --> 41:19.319
we now know that fires spread
right around the globe.

41:19.320 --> 41:23.639
But were these fires devastating
enough to cause the extinction

41:23.640 --> 41:27.680
of all of the world's
dinosaurs in a single day?

41:30.240 --> 41:33.599
'To find out, I'm traveling
far from the impact site

41:33.600 --> 41:36.879
'to the very tip of South America

41:36.880 --> 41:40.120
'and the remote wilderness of Patagonia.'

41:41.920 --> 41:45.960
Over 4,000 miles away from
where the asteroid hit.

41:54.160 --> 41:59.959
I am all the way down here in Chile.

41:59.960 --> 42:01.679
Now, we tend to think of this asteroid

42:01.680 --> 42:05.479
as being absolutely enormous,
and it was - 14km in diameter -

42:05.480 --> 42:08.519
but in the context of
the size of the Earth,

42:08.520 --> 42:11.639
that's like a grain of sand
impacting on a bowling ball.

42:11.640 --> 42:15.759
And I want to understand
what kind of impact

42:15.760 --> 42:19.999
the asteroid landing here
had on the dinosaurs

42:20.000 --> 42:23.280
right down here at the
toe of South America.

42:28.880 --> 42:33.359
Leading the hunt for clues is
palaeontologist Marcelo Leppe.

42:33.360 --> 42:36.639
He's taking me to look for dinosaur remains

42:36.640 --> 42:40.080
in a mountain valley that's
best accessed on four legs.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.879
Marcelo, can you explain to me how
the geology of this valley works?

42:54.880 --> 42:58.279
Actually, we are passing through time

42:58.280 --> 43:01.919
and we are moving to the
end of the Cretaceous,

43:01.920 --> 43:04.359
to the end of the age of the dinosaurs.

43:04.360 --> 43:07.079
We are, at the moment,
in 80 million years ago,

43:07.080 --> 43:08.559
this is Campanian.

43:08.560 --> 43:09.599
So this is fantastic.

43:09.600 --> 43:12.279
As we ride along the
valley, as we ride north,

43:12.280 --> 43:14.999
we're riding from 80 million
to 66 million years.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.320
Through time.

43:17.520 --> 43:20.520
Getting closer to that extinction event.

43:23.320 --> 43:26.359
We've reached the Valley of the Dinosaurs.

43:26.360 --> 43:30.159
Now I want to see what sort of
dinosaurs lived here and find out

43:30.160 --> 43:33.720
what happened to them in the
hours after the impact.

43:36.280 --> 43:38.399
So, shall we get off and have a look?

43:38.400 --> 43:42.480
- Yeah, let's leave the horses and look.
- Seems like a good idea.

43:45.360 --> 43:48.399
The place is literally full of bones.

43:48.400 --> 43:50.919
As you can see, this sunlight is the best

43:50.920 --> 43:54.279
because the angular light
is reflecting the bones.

43:54.280 --> 43:57.120
- Let's see if we can find a dinosaur,
then. - Yeah, let's... let's see.

43:58.720 --> 44:00.040
Oh, for example, there.

44:01.120 --> 44:03.359
Or here.

44:03.360 --> 44:05.559
Look, just beside you.

44:05.560 --> 44:08.639
- This, here?
- Yes, this is a dinosaur bone.

44:08.640 --> 44:10.519
Oh. That's fantastic.

44:10.520 --> 44:12.839
They're different color.
Greyish, or white.

44:12.840 --> 44:14.839
Yeah, so what's that, then?

44:14.840 --> 44:17.279
Oh, it looks like a vertebrae.

44:17.280 --> 44:18.679
Probably the first one.

44:18.680 --> 44:20.159
OK, so... yeah.

44:20.160 --> 44:22.919
That looks like a facet, it looks
like the surface of a joint

44:22.920 --> 44:24.599
and that would be where the skull sits.

44:24.600 --> 44:26.959
Any ideas what species?

44:26.960 --> 44:30.279
- Yeah, probably a hadrosaur. 99%.
- Really? - Yeah.

44:30.280 --> 44:33.440
- That's your first hadrosaur, yeah?
- Yeah, it is.

44:34.520 --> 44:38.240
'This valley is now a bone
bed, four miles long.'

44:39.400 --> 44:44.199
Yes, that is a bit of fossilized
bone and they're everywhere.

44:44.200 --> 44:45.799
Scattered across this hillside.

44:45.800 --> 44:47.160
It's just extraordinary.

44:50.280 --> 44:52.640
Once, it was home to herds of hadrosaurs.

44:57.040 --> 45:02.120
Plant-eaters up to 30-feet long with
a distinctive duck-billed face.

45:04.520 --> 45:07.719
But did the dinosaurs down in Patagonia

45:07.720 --> 45:10.520
die on the day the asteroid hit?

45:16.880 --> 45:18.999
Thanks to the team in Bremen,

45:19.000 --> 45:22.919
we now know that once the asteroid
struck the Yucatan Peninsula

45:22.920 --> 45:25.279
over 4,000 miles away,

45:25.280 --> 45:29.439
it took 42 minutes for the
superheated cloud of debris

45:29.440 --> 45:31.080
to reach Patagonia.

45:33.360 --> 45:34.599
For much of the planet,

45:34.600 --> 45:37.679
the fires triggered by the burning sky

45:37.680 --> 45:39.840
led to total destruction.

45:46.840 --> 45:49.199
But Marcelo has found evidence

45:49.200 --> 45:51.880
that that may not have been the story here.

45:53.240 --> 45:56.879
Plants that the hadrosaurs used to eat.

45:56.880 --> 45:59.759
This is Nothofagus, the southern beech.

45:59.760 --> 46:02.359
They're all around here, aren't they?

46:02.360 --> 46:07.439
And if you want to see it,
look at that architecture.

46:07.440 --> 46:10.079
And I want to show you also this one.

46:10.080 --> 46:11.559
This is from Las Chinas,

46:11.560 --> 46:14.599
the same valley we were
looking for the hadrosaurs.

46:14.600 --> 46:15.959
Oh, this is fantastic.

46:15.960 --> 46:18.439
- This is what the hadrosaurs
were walking on. - Yeah.

46:18.440 --> 46:21.679
- And if you want to compare it...
- Well, that looks incredibly similar.

46:21.680 --> 46:23.239
Is there actually a relationship

46:23.240 --> 46:25.319
between this fossil leaf
and this living one?

46:25.320 --> 46:27.999
Oh, there is a direct line

46:28.000 --> 46:32.159
from this fossil and this one that
is living today in Patagonia.

46:32.160 --> 46:35.279
So this is fantastic evidence
that, down here in Patagonia,

46:35.280 --> 46:37.720
some spaces did actually make it through.

46:40.120 --> 46:43.639
66 million years ago,
this region was warm, wet

46:43.640 --> 46:46.720
and dense with vegetation
like the southern beech.

46:48.880 --> 46:52.320
A species of plant that survived
the fires on impact day.

46:55.080 --> 46:56.559
And if plants survived,

46:56.560 --> 46:59.520
maybe the dinosaurs here
could have done, too.

47:04.840 --> 47:08.639
Life down here should have been badly hit,

47:08.640 --> 47:12.479
but the fossil evidence,
particularly of plant life,

47:12.480 --> 47:14.879
is telling us a different story -

47:14.880 --> 47:17.719
that the immediate fallout from Chicxulub

47:17.720 --> 47:21.559
in Patagonia was not as bad as predicted.

47:21.560 --> 47:25.439
So perhaps our hadrosaurs
had a stay of execution,

47:25.440 --> 47:28.599
maybe they made it through that first day.

47:28.600 --> 47:30.599
But something...

47:30.600 --> 47:32.160
Something got them in the end.

47:36.840 --> 47:40.879
To determine exactly what did happen
in the days, weeks and months

47:40.880 --> 47:44.159
after the asteroid struck,
the Bremen team are still

47:44.160 --> 47:47.880
hard at work studying rock
samples from the impact crater.

47:52.280 --> 47:57.760
Dr Philippe Claeys thinks he's found
perhaps the most important clue yet.

48:02.800 --> 48:05.119
So, Philippe, when this
asteroid struck Earth,

48:05.120 --> 48:07.239
it had a massive and devastating impact.

48:07.240 --> 48:09.799
But that didn't quite seal the
fate of the dinosaurs, did it?

48:09.800 --> 48:13.239
Probably not. Remember, the
dinosaurs were ideally adapted

48:13.240 --> 48:15.399
to the late Cretaceous environment.

48:15.400 --> 48:18.879
They were the ultimate
animal for the Cretaceous.

48:18.880 --> 48:20.479
What happened here is that

48:20.480 --> 48:23.439
we have an incredible change
in the Earth's system,

48:23.440 --> 48:27.719
basically kills the dinosaur
everywhere on Earth -

48:27.720 --> 48:30.959
in Africa, Antarctica, in the
forests, or in the savanna.

48:30.960 --> 48:32.119
But what made them extinct?

48:32.120 --> 48:33.839
You talk about a global scale, suddenly.

48:33.840 --> 48:36.839
- What went global? What happened?
- What went global is really

48:36.840 --> 48:39.599
the ejection of material from the crater.

48:39.600 --> 48:42.439
- Look at what I have in my pocket
- this is gypsum. - Right, OK.

48:42.440 --> 48:46.959
This was part of Yucatan at the
time of impact. - Yeah. - OK?

48:46.960 --> 48:49.719
And this material here contains sulphate.

48:49.720 --> 48:54.759
And this gypsum affects the
chemistry of the atmosphere.

48:54.760 --> 48:56.759
It changes it drastically.

48:56.760 --> 48:58.879
This area's meant to be
rich in this sort of stuff.

48:58.880 --> 49:02.359
It's supposed to be full of it.
But it's not.

49:02.360 --> 49:05.399
We can look for the remnants of it here.

49:05.400 --> 49:07.159
In the core, it's totally absent,

49:07.160 --> 49:10.759
which means that almost the
entire sequence of gypsum

49:10.760 --> 49:13.519
that was present in the sedimentary target

49:13.520 --> 49:15.960
at the time of impact
went into the atmosphere.

49:20.880 --> 49:23.159
This is a huge discovery.

49:23.160 --> 49:26.719
The presence of gypsum means
the plume of vaporized rock

49:26.720 --> 49:31.399
that spread across the world
was dense with sulphates

49:31.400 --> 49:32.640
that blocked sunlight.

49:38.240 --> 49:42.719
The same thing happened after the
1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo

49:42.720 --> 49:44.000
in the Philippines.

49:45.520 --> 49:49.919
Sulphates reduced the amount of
sunlight reaching land by 10%,

49:49.920 --> 49:52.480
which caused a drop in global temperatures.

49:55.080 --> 49:59.839
25 years ago, Pinatubo had an
incredible effect on the atmosphere.

49:59.840 --> 50:04.079
It cooled it by very little,
but it had an effect.

50:04.080 --> 50:05.999
- And it stayed for a couple of years.
- Right.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.199
Here, we have an event which is
orders of magnitude more important.

50:09.200 --> 50:12.399
Pinatubo is nothing compared
to the Chicxulub impact.

50:12.400 --> 50:15.599
It is really going global,
no place is protected,

50:15.600 --> 50:17.039
no dinosaur can escape

50:17.040 --> 50:19.639
the consequence of the Chicxulub impact.

50:19.640 --> 50:21.199
This is the gypsum.

50:21.200 --> 50:24.040
- This is what killed the dinosaurs.
- Wow.

50:28.320 --> 50:31.840
This astonishing find is the
final piece of the jigsaw...

50:33.520 --> 50:35.559
allowing us, for the first time,

50:35.560 --> 50:38.600
to model what finally killed the dinosaurs.

50:40.880 --> 50:43.679
It's what happened in the
days after the impact

50:43.680 --> 50:46.000
that made it a global extinction.

50:48.640 --> 50:51.160
Our blue planet turned Grey.

50:54.680 --> 50:58.999
Long after the hot skies cooled,
ash and dust in the atmosphere

50:59.000 --> 51:01.560
almost completely blocked out the sun.

51:02.760 --> 51:06.039
As the lights went out,
global temperatures plunged

51:06.040 --> 51:08.960
more than ten degrees
centigrade within days.

51:13.920 --> 51:16.760
This is where we get to the
great irony of the story.

51:21.320 --> 51:24.080
Because in the end, it wasn't
the size of the asteroid...

51:26.680 --> 51:29.279
the scale of the blast,

51:29.280 --> 51:33.200
or even its global reach
that made dinosaurs extinct.

51:34.600 --> 51:36.440
It was where the impact happened.

51:39.240 --> 51:41.999
Had the asteroid struck
a few moments earlier,

51:42.000 --> 51:44.079
or maybe even a couple of seconds later,

51:44.080 --> 51:47.479
then rather than hitting
shallow coastal waters,

51:47.480 --> 51:50.160
it might have hit deep ocean.

51:52.080 --> 51:55.079
An impact in the nearby
Atlantic or Pacific oceans

51:55.080 --> 51:57.839
would have meant much less vaporized rock,

51:57.840 --> 51:59.800
including the deadly gypsum.

52:02.040 --> 52:04.399
The cloud would have been less dense

52:04.400 --> 52:07.680
and sunlight could have still
reached the planet's surface...

52:09.480 --> 52:12.720
meaning what happened next
might have been avoided.

52:14.160 --> 52:16.519
In this cold, dark world,

52:16.520 --> 52:19.519
food ran out in the oceans within a week,

52:19.520 --> 52:22.759
and shortly after, on land also.

52:22.760 --> 52:25.679
With nothing to eat anywhere on the planet,

52:25.680 --> 52:28.920
the mighty dinosaurs stood
little chance of survival.

52:36.960 --> 52:41.639
In Patagonia, 10% of plant
species went extinct.

52:41.640 --> 52:44.359
The southern beeches would
have shed their leaves,

52:44.360 --> 52:48.079
shutting down for the long winter
that the asteroid set off.

52:48.080 --> 52:50.520
The hadrosaurs were left to starve.

52:55.880 --> 52:58.759
The demise of the dinosaurs
down here in Patagonia

52:58.760 --> 53:03.319
was nowhere near as dramatic as
being obliterated by a blast wave,

53:03.320 --> 53:05.279
or drowned in a tsunami,

53:05.280 --> 53:08.959
or even being caught up in
a colossal forest fire.

53:08.960 --> 53:11.240
But they were doomed, nonetheless.

53:15.200 --> 53:19.039
The dinosaurs as a group were
hugely successful and diverse,

53:19.040 --> 53:23.080
they'd been on the planet for
more than 150 million years.

53:24.840 --> 53:28.560
But this Chicxulub event was more
than just a local phenomenon.

53:29.920 --> 53:32.479
It changed the climate globally,

53:32.480 --> 53:35.759
plunging the world into
a deep, deep winter.

53:35.760 --> 53:38.839
And there was no time to adapt.

53:38.840 --> 53:40.119
So, in some ways,

53:40.120 --> 53:43.920
the dinosaurs that died
instantaneously were the lucky ones.

53:49.680 --> 53:53.359
This sudden climate change may
finally solve the mystery of

53:53.360 --> 53:54.960
what happened in New Jersey.

53:57.280 --> 54:01.079
As the food supply in the oceans dwindled,

54:01.080 --> 54:03.960
shallow water creatures roamed ever deeper.

54:05.360 --> 54:07.840
But eventually, the food would run out.

54:10.680 --> 54:16.599
And all of those animals from
different parts of the oceans died,

54:16.600 --> 54:18.720
coming to rest in a single layer.

54:29.680 --> 54:34.559
It's been an incredible adventure
decades in the planning.

54:34.560 --> 54:38.639
A multi-million-pound
scientific expedition,

54:38.640 --> 54:43.359
weeks of drilling rock samples
from deep inside a super crater,

54:43.360 --> 54:48.279
and months of studying hundreds
of metres of rock samples.

54:48.280 --> 54:53.799
- So, this was E4. - Yep.
- Which is 53 million to 55.

54:53.800 --> 54:57.039
We were just jazzed about
the science, all day long.

54:57.040 --> 54:58.999
Many people have been up for 20 hours

54:59.000 --> 55:01.879
and they were still just
going with enthusiasm,

55:01.880 --> 55:04.399
describing the cores, looking
at the micro-fossils.

55:04.400 --> 55:07.119
It was a heady experience.

55:07.120 --> 55:11.439
All that hard work has
paid off in a big way.

55:11.440 --> 55:16.399
The team has been able to reveal
extraordinary new details,

55:16.400 --> 55:19.759
evidence about how the dinosaurs died.

55:19.760 --> 55:23.720
But perhaps even astonishing than
what killed the dinosaurs...

55:24.920 --> 55:27.400
is what happened after they were gone.

55:30.560 --> 55:34.760
The asteroid and its aftermath
ended the age of the dinosaurs.

55:37.360 --> 55:42.439
But as the cloud started to
clear, months or years later,

55:42.440 --> 55:45.360
the dormant plants came back to life.

55:46.560 --> 55:52.199
And a tiny group of animals came out
of hiding to inherit the Earth.

55:52.200 --> 55:55.559
Creatures that would,
over millions of years,

55:55.560 --> 55:58.919
evolve into a huge range
of different species...

55:58.920 --> 56:00.799
Including us.

56:00.800 --> 56:02.559
On the tip of my finger right here

56:02.560 --> 56:08.159
is a lower tooth of
something called mesodma.

56:08.160 --> 56:11.320
This was a little guy who was
probably about the size of a mouse.

56:14.200 --> 56:17.039
This is one tough little mammal.

56:17.040 --> 56:19.959
One of the very few
species known to survive

56:19.960 --> 56:22.239
through the global devastation.

56:22.240 --> 56:23.959
It's a blade-like tooth.

56:23.960 --> 56:27.359
It was able to feed on things
like insects and seeds,

56:27.360 --> 56:30.360
so it didn't have to
rely on photosynthesis.

56:32.960 --> 56:38.559
Mammals had lived in the shadow of
the dinosaurs for 100 million years.

56:38.560 --> 56:41.239
But now it was their turn.

56:41.240 --> 56:44.399
This chance event that was
the doom of the dinosaurs

56:44.400 --> 56:48.040
was a stroke of luck for
the surviving mammals.

56:50.800 --> 56:52.319
With the dinosaurs gone,

56:52.320 --> 56:55.279
suddenly, the landscape
was empty of competitors

56:55.280 --> 56:56.800
and ripe with possibilities.

57:09.920 --> 57:12.559
Just half a million years after
the extinction of the dinosaurs,

57:12.560 --> 57:16.079
and landscapes around the globe
had filled up with mammals

57:16.080 --> 57:17.920
of all shapes and sizes.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.119
Fast forward another 60
million years or so,

57:25.120 --> 57:28.439
and we have the evolution of an
extraordinary upright walking ape

57:28.440 --> 57:31.399
that contemplates its own existence

57:31.400 --> 57:35.679
and the demise of ancient
creatures they'd never even seen.

57:35.680 --> 57:38.239
Chances are, if it wasn't
for that asteroid,

57:38.240 --> 57:41.400
we wouldn't be here to
tell the story today.
