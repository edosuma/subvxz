00:20.604 --> 00:23.523
For you, picking Sarah Palin
was about winning an election,

00:23.607 --> 00:27.360
not necessarily about who's gonna
be best as vice president.

00:27.444 --> 00:30.613
My job is to give
political advice.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.907
We needed to do something bold

00:32.991 --> 00:35.034
to try to win the race.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.119
If you had it to do over again,

00:37.204 --> 00:39.372
would you have her on the ticket?

00:54.888 --> 00:57.557
- Hello.
- They fucking hate me, Steve.

00:57.641 --> 00:59.267
Who's that, sir?

00:59.351 --> 01:01.644
Limbaugh, Hannity, Coulter.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.397
They're dancing on my grave
like it's fucking Mardi Gras.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.399
That may be true, but
there's an upside

01:06.483 --> 01:07.984
to being in last place.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.778
You can say what you truly feel.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.072
You think I've been holding back?

01:13.073 --> 01:14.115
I do, Senator.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.033
The surge is working,

01:16.118 --> 01:18.494
but no one else is brave
enough to say it.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.580
Romney, Giuliani, Huckabee...

01:20.664 --> 01:23.040
all your opponents are hedging.

01:23.125 --> 01:26.168
Even you hesitated
at the last debate.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.920
A great man once told me,

01:28.005 --> 01:29.672
I would rather lose the election

01:29.756 --> 01:31.507
than see the country
lose this war.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.217
And I meant it, Steve.

01:33.302 --> 01:34.635
Then say it, sir.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.138
John McCain doesn't
say what's popular,

01:37.222 --> 01:38.806
he says what's right.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.266
My advice would be

01:40.350 --> 01:42.768
to get some old POW
buddies together

01:42.853 --> 01:45.062
and travel the country
in a small caravan.

01:45.147 --> 01:47.273
Stay in shitty hotels,

01:47.357 --> 01:49.358
do American Legion halls,

01:49.443 --> 01:51.986
V.F.W. posts, have a few beers

01:52.070 --> 01:53.988
and enjoy yourself.

01:54.072 --> 01:56.490
You're right, goddamn it.

02:00.579 --> 02:04.373
I don't know what the
hell's wrong with me.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.459
You get so caught up in winning,

02:06.543 --> 02:09.336
- you start to lose yourself.
- It's gonna be easy because

02:09.420 --> 02:11.631
there's only one message
you need to get across.

02:11.715 --> 02:13.966
Yeah? What's that?

02:14.051 --> 02:17.553
John McCain puts country first.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.063
Would you consider joining us?

02:27.147 --> 02:30.941
Even just for a few weeks?

02:31.026 --> 02:33.444
Senator, there is
no one in this race

02:33.528 --> 02:36.614
I admire more than you,
but I promised my wife

02:36.698 --> 02:38.324
that I would sit this cycle out.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.659
I know that, Steve,

02:39.743 --> 02:41.160
but will you just think about it?

02:41.244 --> 02:43.044
Just do that... Just think
about it, will you?

02:43.080 --> 02:44.497
Of course, Senator.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.832
- You promise?
- I will, I promise.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.334
Great, I'll call you tomorrow.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.211
- Okay.
- Thanks, Stevie boy.

02:53.090 --> 02:55.341
Fuck.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.218
Senator McCain today reshuffling

02:57.302 --> 02:59.095
his most senior campaign staff.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.765
John McCain wins the
New Hampshire primary,

03:02.849 --> 03:06.560
a huge comeback for the
senator from Arizona.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.145
You hear them
chanting behind me...

03:08.230 --> 03:09.855
Mac is back, Mac is back.

03:09.940 --> 03:13.275
A big win for John McCain
in South Carolina,

03:13.360 --> 03:14.944
a win that he will relish.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.612
The question on the
campaign trail was

03:16.697 --> 03:18.572
can a soufflÃ© rise twice?

03:18.657 --> 03:23.244
John McCain wins the Republican
presidential nomination.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.870
What a historic night.

03:24.955 --> 03:26.956
And they said we were dead.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.958
The White House.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.427
Obama. Obama.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.242
People of Berlin

04:03.326 --> 04:05.494
and people of the world,

04:05.579 --> 04:08.414
the scale of our
challenge is great.

04:08.498 --> 04:11.125
The road ahead will be long.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.793
But I come before you

04:12.878 --> 04:16.464
to say that we are heirs
to a struggle for freedom.

04:16.548 --> 04:19.425
We are a people of improbable hope

04:19.509 --> 04:21.927
with an eye towards the future,

04:22.012 --> 04:24.263
with resolve in our heart.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.015
Let us remember this history

04:26.099 --> 04:28.017
and answer our destiny

04:28.101 --> 04:29.769
and remake the world once again.

04:29.853 --> 04:33.022
Thank you, Berlin. God bless you.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.857
Thank you.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.612
If he heals a sick baby,
we're really fucked.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.614
We're down by 15.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.908
If his convention speech
is as good as that...

04:43.992 --> 04:45.409
It'll be better.

04:45.494 --> 04:46.952
Then we'll be trailing by 20

04:47.037 --> 04:48.120
going into St. Paul.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.206
It's an uphill battle, John.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.208
Well, as Chairman Mao
was fond of saying,

04:52.292 --> 04:55.377
It's always darkest before
it's completely black.

04:55.462 --> 04:58.506
Senator, it always concerns me
when you quote Chairman Mao.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.299
This guy is raising money

05:00.383 --> 05:02.968
like he's some sort of
a human ATM machine.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.970
John, if there ever was a time

05:05.055 --> 05:07.556
to run a Reverend Wright
ad, this is that time.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.059
- Absolutely not.
- I agree.

05:10.143 --> 05:14.063
There's footage of his own
reverend saying goddamn America.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.898
It's the single best
weapon we've got.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.734
I want to run a fucking campaign
that my kids can be proud of,

05:18.819 --> 05:21.529
and that precludes attacking
a black reverend.

05:21.613 --> 05:24.490
I think we're going
about this all wrong.

05:24.574 --> 05:28.369
This man is on the cover
of every news magazine.

05:28.453 --> 05:31.080
He's on the cover of every
entertainment magazine.

05:31.164 --> 05:35.417
He's got 200,000 people
screaming for him in Berlin.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.586
And what has he done?

05:38.755 --> 05:40.673
A man of no accomplishment

05:40.757 --> 05:43.217
has become the biggest
celebrity in the world,

05:43.301 --> 05:46.762
and we keep trying to reach
up and pull him down.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.598
What we need to do is
ask the American people

05:49.683 --> 05:52.017
a very simple question:

05:52.102 --> 05:56.272
Do you want a statesman to
be your next president...

05:57.816 --> 05:59.608
or do you want a celebrity?

06:01.987 --> 06:03.279
Try it.

06:05.282 --> 06:08.117
He's the biggest
celebrity in the world.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.869
Obama. Obama.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.246
But is he ready to lead?

06:12.330 --> 06:14.665
With gas prices soaring,

06:14.749 --> 06:18.085
Barack Obama says no
to offshore drilling

06:18.169 --> 06:21.088
and says he'll raise
taxes on electricity?

06:21.172 --> 06:24.383
Higher taxes, more foreign oil...

06:24.467 --> 06:26.927
that's the real Obama.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.429
Great job, Fred.

06:28.513 --> 06:31.515
I thought we were the
grown-ups in this race.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.560
John, it's his girlfriend.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.605
This is a cautionary tale, John.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.565
It's what I'm talking about.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.235
Yeah, right. Yeah, let's...

06:43.320 --> 06:45.905
- Let's watch it again.
- No, I can't, I can't. Please.

06:47.365 --> 06:50.910
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.454
Now can you believe these guys?

06:53.538 --> 06:56.123
He wants Lieberman on the ticket.

06:56.207 --> 06:58.250
- Of course he does.
- Disaster.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.044
Or historic.

07:00.128 --> 07:03.422
- Or historic disaster.
- John loves him.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.883
It would be a strong move
towards bipartisanship.

07:05.967 --> 07:09.094
Guys, the base is
already concerned

07:09.179 --> 07:11.847
that John is not a
true conservative.

07:11.932 --> 07:15.768
Now, I don't think picking a
pro-choice Jewish Democrat

07:15.852 --> 07:17.652
who just happened to be
Al Gore's running mate

07:17.729 --> 07:20.397
is going to alleviate
that concern.

07:20.482 --> 07:25.402
Maybe we have McCain
make a one-term pledge.

07:25.487 --> 07:28.155
He announces in some huge
speech that he and a Democrat

07:28.239 --> 07:31.158
are joining together for one term

07:31.242 --> 07:33.327
so that the parties
can come together

07:33.411 --> 07:35.788
and solve this country's
greatest problems.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.374
Maybe, with a one-term pledge.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.294
Nothing says country first
like picking Joe Lieberman.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.797
Well, if it's gonna work,

07:44.881 --> 07:46.757
it has to remain
absolutely secret,

07:46.841 --> 07:48.634
right up until the convention.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.886
If it gets leaked, the
right will kill it.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.974
John McCain's decision
to put Joe Lieberman

07:55.058 --> 07:57.184
front and centre at his convention

07:57.268 --> 07:59.269
has the unique distinction
of unsettling

07:59.354 --> 08:01.230
both Democrats and Republicans.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.649
I think the idea of him
being the Republican

08:03.733 --> 08:06.026
vice presidential nominee
would split the convention.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.404
In the cabinet, fine. Not as V.P.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.072
Bad choice. Conservatives
will bolt.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.491
Comedy team of McCain
and Lieberman.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.335
Maybe they'll play
Atlantic City this summer.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.287
Thank you.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.665
So what the fuck happened?

08:19.749 --> 08:22.459
Lindsey Graham was trying to
build support for the idea

08:22.544 --> 08:24.753
- and it leaked.
- Goddamn it, Lindsey.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.172
Well, if it's any consolation,

08:27.257 --> 08:29.591
my numbers show that
if you pick Lieberman

08:29.676 --> 08:32.010
or any pro-choice candidate,

08:32.095 --> 08:34.013
40% of your core supporters

08:34.097 --> 08:35.931
will be less likely
to support you.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.433
40%.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.727
And you gain very
few independents.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.562
Overall, it's a wide-net negative.

08:41.645 --> 08:43.846
We've made a lot of calls.
Some people don't even think.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.025
Lieberman can make it
through the convention.

08:46.109 --> 08:47.526
Others say, yeah, he can,

08:47.610 --> 08:49.903
but he's gonna rip
the party in half.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.864
But Joe is perfect.
We're both mavericks

08:51.948 --> 08:54.366
that are hated by the
assholes in our own parties.

08:54.451 --> 08:57.202
It could have a tremendous
healing effect on the country.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.538
We can't win without our base.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.415
Lieberman is the
right thing to do,

09:01.499 --> 09:03.333
but the wrong way to win.

09:05.170 --> 09:08.338
- Who all have we vetted?
- Romney, Crist, Pawlenty.

09:08.423 --> 09:11.050
- We're trying to vet Bloomberg.
- Who can we win with?

09:11.134 --> 09:12.718
- None of them.
- None of them?

09:12.802 --> 09:16.388
John, Obama just changed
the entire dynamic.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.474
It is a change year, sir.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.769
We desperately need a
game-changing pick,

09:21.853 --> 09:25.481
and none of these middle-aged
white guys are game-changers.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.859
So... what?

09:28.943 --> 09:30.652
I just fuck off and die?

09:30.737 --> 09:34.239
Well, the data shows we have
four things we have to do.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.617
We have to win back
the independents,

09:36.701 --> 09:38.118
we have to excite the base,

09:38.203 --> 09:41.497
we have to distance ourselves
from the Bush administration,

09:41.581 --> 09:43.832
and we have to close
the gender gap.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.543
How bad is the gap?

09:46.628 --> 09:49.088
It's fatal.

09:49.172 --> 09:53.217
You've got a 20% advantage
with men, which is great,

09:53.301 --> 09:55.552
but a 20% deficit with women.

09:55.637 --> 09:58.347
You've got to pick
up 15% with females.

09:58.431 --> 10:02.059
Because if you're trailing
by more than five with them,

10:02.143 --> 10:03.393
you lose.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.940
So find me a woman.

10:10.485 --> 10:13.695
All right, ladies.
Who's it gonna be?

10:20.829 --> 10:24.957
Meg Whitman supports
abortion rights.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.878
Pro-choice, pro-choice.

10:33.091 --> 10:36.218
- Who are you?
- These solar arrays combined

10:36.302 --> 10:40.139
will allow us to produce
34 megawatts of power...

10:42.725 --> 10:45.519
To make sure that risk management

10:45.603 --> 10:48.397
is the best that we
can do to secure...

10:50.066 --> 10:53.652
But as you know, the turnpike
ends here in Augusta.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.404
At that point...

11:01.077 --> 11:02.953
What was her name?

11:05.206 --> 11:07.791
Once Alaska is allowed

11:07.876 --> 11:10.961
to very responsibly and
safely develop our resources,

11:11.045 --> 11:13.125
we'll lower costs of energy
across the United States,

11:13.131 --> 11:15.215
and then we'd be able
to secure the nation

11:15.300 --> 11:18.010
with a clean, domestic
supply of energy.

11:19.262 --> 11:21.930
And I say that, Charlie,
even personally.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.349
My one and only son,
my 18-year-old,

11:24.434 --> 11:26.194
he just signed up for
the United States Army.

11:26.269 --> 11:27.686
He's at boot camp right now.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.104
And I'm thinking, you know,

11:29.189 --> 11:32.983
this kid is doing all that
he can within his power

11:33.067 --> 11:36.612
to help secure and defend
the United States.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.281
Every elected official had
better be asking themselves,

11:39.365 --> 11:41.783
are you doing as much also?

11:41.868 --> 11:43.744
Are you doing all that you can?

11:46.456 --> 11:47.873
She's a star.

11:47.957 --> 11:51.460
She's so passionately
pro-life that at age 44,

11:51.544 --> 11:53.003
she decided to keep a child

11:53.087 --> 11:56.215
that she knew midterm
had Down syndrome.

11:56.299 --> 11:58.717
And there's a lot more
that the base will love.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.887
She has an 80% approval
rating in Alaska.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.129
The highest of any
governor in the country...

12:04.130 --> 12:05.132
80%?

12:05.133 --> 12:07.476
And she got it by
taking on the oil lobby

12:07.560 --> 12:08.894
and the Republican establishment.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.063
She's the one who killed
the Bridge to Nowhere.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.565
I fought Ted Stevens for months

12:13.650 --> 12:15.567
on that stupid fucking bridge.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.069
Plus, she is a devout Christian.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.404
She's got a son about
to deploy to Iraq,

12:19.489 --> 12:21.365
attractive mother of five.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.909
- She likes to moose hunt.
- Moose hunt?

12:23.993 --> 12:25.410
This is a woman with a gun, John.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.746
I mean, come on, the base is
gonna be doing back flips.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.331
What does Salter think?

12:29.415 --> 12:32.292
He's worried that
she's a creationist.

12:32.377 --> 12:35.087
Yeah, and that's exactly why
the base will love her.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.588
Women will love her.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.174
Plus, she gives you
distance from Bush.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.260
Furthermore, she's
so outside the box

12:41.344 --> 12:44.846
that she helps you recapture
the maverick label,

12:44.931 --> 12:46.723
which will win back independents.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.725
She's everything we need.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.939
You don't think she might
be too outside the box?

12:54.023 --> 12:58.944
Huh. Well, that's what makes
her such a maverick choice.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.196
So is picking Lieberman.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.282
That'd be pretty
goddamn mavericky.

13:03.366 --> 13:05.867
Sir, we live in the age of YouTube

13:05.952 --> 13:08.203
and the 24-hour news cycle.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.955
How else do you think a man

13:10.039 --> 13:13.292
who has absolutely no major
life accomplishments

13:13.376 --> 13:16.962
is beating an American
hero by double digits?

13:17.046 --> 13:20.632
He's simply sailing on his
charisma and star power.

13:20.717 --> 13:24.845
We need to create a dynamic
moment in this campaign

13:24.929 --> 13:26.305
or we're dead.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.223
You think she's that good?

13:28.308 --> 13:29.558
She could be.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.560
And we can vet her in five days?

13:31.644 --> 13:32.936
We can.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.855
The vet has to be
as thorough for her

13:34.939 --> 13:37.232
as it was for all the
other candidates.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.651
Culvahouse says he
can do it, so...

13:39.736 --> 13:41.611
The clock is ticking, sir.

13:41.696 --> 13:45.490
If you are going to seriously
consider the governor of Alaska,

13:45.575 --> 13:47.617
you have to call her now.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.778
You know, Governor, these
gas prices are killing us.

13:54.779 --> 13:56.835
Oh, my goodness, don't I know it.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.587
They're killing me and Todd, too.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.088
Hey, how are ya?

14:00.173 --> 14:02.674
But once Alaska is
allowed to very safely

14:02.759 --> 14:04.509
and responsibly develop
our resources,

14:04.594 --> 14:07.637
we'll lower cost of energy
across the entire nation.

14:07.722 --> 14:09.139
You keep giving 'em
hell, Governor.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.016
Aw, thanks. Nice talking to ya.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.976
Mum, can we go on the
roller coaster now?

14:13.061 --> 14:14.478
Yeah. No, of course, honey.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.021
- Hey, Bristol?
- Yeah?

14:16.105 --> 14:19.358
Can you hold Trig? I'm gonna take
Piper on the roller coaster.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.902
- Sure.
- There you go.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.613
There you go, buddy.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.870
- Mum.
- Just one second, hon.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.955
This is Sarah.

14:54.310 --> 14:57.521
Thank you for coming on such
short notice, Governor.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.356
Should this go according to plan,

14:59.440 --> 15:02.359
we will take you to meet
Senator McCain at his compound

15:02.443 --> 15:03.902
first thing in the morning.

15:03.986 --> 15:07.239
Now, if he chooses you
to be his running mate,

15:07.323 --> 15:08.990
you will instantly become

15:09.075 --> 15:11.159
one of the most famous
people on the planet.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.412
Your life will be investigated,

15:13.496 --> 15:14.913
manipulated, distorted,

15:14.997 --> 15:18.375
and you will lose any
semblance of privacy.

15:18.459 --> 15:21.711
Knowing this, are
you 100% committed

15:21.796 --> 15:23.880
to going forward
with this project?

15:23.965 --> 15:25.507
Absolutely.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.592
I have a servant's heart.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.928
And if you really think
I can help this ticket,

15:30.012 --> 15:31.972
if you really think I
can help this country,

15:32.056 --> 15:34.182
then absolutely...
I'll do this with ya.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.601
Your private life
will be subjected

15:36.686 --> 15:40.105
to harsh, often unfair attacks.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.524
Nothing can prepare you for...

15:42.608 --> 15:43.942
how ugly this can be. Not...

15:44.026 --> 15:46.945
I do understand that.
Here's the deal.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.114
I went through a tough
primary in Alaska,

15:49.198 --> 15:51.741
and I know how ugly it can get.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.162
Well, Governor, things can get

15:55.246 --> 15:57.080
quite a bit rougher on
the national stage.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.040
I don't know, Alaska's
pretty rough.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.877
Now, you and Senator McCain

16:01.961 --> 16:04.838
have a difference of
opinion on several issues.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.340
He is pro-life, but he's
in favour of exceptions

16:07.425 --> 16:10.594
in the case of rape, incest or
a mother's life being at risk.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.471
- You are not.
- That is correct.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.681
I am unapologetically pro-life.

16:16.017 --> 16:18.643
Senator McCain supports
stem cell research.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.979
- You do not.
- That's true, I do not.

16:21.063 --> 16:24.608
John McCain would never ask you
to contradict your beliefs,

16:24.692 --> 16:28.069
but we expect you to
support his positions.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.280
And we may ask you
to appear in ads

16:30.364 --> 16:32.824
advocating those positions.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.451
Do you have a problem with that?

16:34.535 --> 16:37.662
No, I don't. Not at all.

16:37.747 --> 16:41.124
Senator McCain can count
on my full support.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.793
I would be so proud to
be a member of his team.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.507
Do you reject the
theory of evolution?

16:50.510 --> 16:53.136
I'm the daughter of
a science teacher.

16:53.221 --> 16:56.389
My dad showed me
fossils growing up.

16:56.474 --> 16:59.309
I know about evolution.
I accept evolution.

16:59.393 --> 17:03.021
But I will never deny that
I see the hand of God

17:03.105 --> 17:08.443
in this beautiful
creation that is Earth.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.032
I'm really glad that
you're asking me

17:15.117 --> 17:17.743
these types of questions.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.204
Why is that?

17:19.288 --> 17:24.166
It's important that you know
exactly what you're getting.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.002
John, let me be very clear.

17:26.087 --> 17:29.381
Every other vet we did was over
a four-to-eight-week period.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.050
This vet has been compiled
in absolute secrecy

17:32.134 --> 17:34.119
in less than five days.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.136
I understand.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.721
Well, in doing a vet this fast,

17:36.806 --> 17:38.974
there's certainly the possibility

17:39.058 --> 17:40.517
that we may have missed something.

17:40.601 --> 17:43.311
Yeah, I got it. What
do you think, A.B?

17:43.396 --> 17:45.814
I like many of her answers
in the questionnaire.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.067
And in the interview, she hit some
of my questions out of the park.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.652
Now...

17:50.736 --> 17:53.446
there are more potential
land mines with Palin

17:53.531 --> 17:55.615
than with the other choices.

17:55.700 --> 17:59.035
She told us she has a teen
daughter who's pregnant.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.329
That should not prevent
this from moving forward,

18:01.414 --> 18:04.416
but we don't know what
else could pop up.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.252
But are you impressed
with her personally?

18:10.756 --> 18:13.091
I am.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.093
She has a great life story

18:15.177 --> 18:18.680
and she's extremely
poised and confident

18:18.764 --> 18:20.348
for someone in her situation.

18:21.684 --> 18:23.476
But you have a candidate

18:23.561 --> 18:25.520
who's only been
governor for 18 months.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.564
Before that, she was the
mayor of a small town

18:27.648 --> 18:29.733
of 10,000 people.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.444
She undercuts your
best attack on Obama

18:32.528 --> 18:34.529
that he's too inexperienced.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.114
Well, that's played out.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.366
We lose by five if we
stick with experience.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.246
You think she's ready
to be president?

18:43.331 --> 18:46.333
I don't think she's gonna
be ready on January 20th,

18:46.417 --> 18:50.879
but I think she has the smarts
to get there eventually.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.175
Give me the bottom line, A.B.

18:55.259 --> 18:58.178
High risk...

18:58.262 --> 19:00.138
high reward.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.642
You shouldn't have told me that.

19:03.726 --> 19:04.809
Why not?

19:04.894 --> 19:08.897
I've been a risk-taker
all my life.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.622
- Hi.
- Hi. How are ya?

19:25.706 --> 19:27.040
Great.

19:27.124 --> 19:28.291
Thanks so much for coming.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.256
Thank you for having me
at your beautiful house.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.713
Well, come on in. Please.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.345
One of the things I'm
most proud of, Sarah,

19:40.429 --> 19:42.347
is my independence.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.265
And I'm very impressed
with how you've bucked

19:44.350 --> 19:46.768
the Republican
establishment in Alaska.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.354
Well, I am wired to be kind
of independent there also.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.690
And I thought if I'm gonna
truly run the state

19:51.774 --> 19:54.067
on behalf of the people,
I'm gonna have to do it

19:54.151 --> 19:56.194
without that good ole boy network.

19:56.278 --> 19:59.864
I love the way you squashed
Stevens's Bridge to Nowhere.

19:59.949 --> 20:03.410
Yeah. I am pro-growth

20:03.494 --> 20:05.453
and pro-infrastructure for Alaska,

20:05.538 --> 20:08.206
but not at the expense of
the American taxpayer.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.208
I told Congress if
we wanted a bridge,

20:10.292 --> 20:12.043
we'd build it ourselves.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.713
You remind me of myself.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.423
We're both reformers
who are not afraid

20:16.507 --> 20:18.007
to thumb our nose
at our own party.

20:18.092 --> 20:20.343
Senator, you're an American hero.

20:20.428 --> 20:24.180
I'm just Sarah from Alaska.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.812
What do you guys think?

20:30.896 --> 20:33.565
I know a guy like Tim Pawlenty

20:33.649 --> 20:35.150
isn't exactly the
game-changing pick

20:35.234 --> 20:36.651
you all seem to think we need,

20:36.736 --> 20:38.153
but he's young, he's energetic.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.197
He has solid conservative
credentials.

20:41.282 --> 20:43.158
With Pawlenty, we
make the base happy.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.494
And we know what the
hell we're getting.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.204
Pawlenty's ready to be president.

20:48.289 --> 20:49.873
Steve?

20:49.957 --> 20:53.418
Well, there are
unknowns with Palin,

20:53.502 --> 20:56.796
and certainly it could go bad.

20:56.881 --> 21:00.258
But if it were me, I'd
rather lose by 10 points

21:00.342 --> 21:02.594
going for the win than
lose by one point

21:02.678 --> 21:04.095
and look back and say, Goddamn,

21:04.180 --> 21:05.680
we should have gone for the win.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.894
Our slogan's Country first.

21:10.978 --> 21:14.564
Lieberman and Pawlenty are
country-first choices.

21:16.358 --> 21:17.901
Sarah Palin will be perceived

21:17.985 --> 21:20.361
as a self-serving
political manoeuvre.

21:23.616 --> 21:27.285
You may not only lose
the election, John.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.788
You just might lose your
reputation right along with it.

21:29.872 --> 21:32.582
I'm not running for my reputation.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.710
I'm running to be president.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.546
Yes, sir.

21:47.181 --> 21:48.765
It is absolutely crucial

21:48.849 --> 21:50.809
that not a single person
know you're the pick.

21:50.893 --> 21:53.520
Surprise of your announcement
will stop any momentum

21:53.604 --> 21:55.855
Obama might get from
his convention speech.

21:55.940 --> 21:57.315
That's smart.

22:04.198 --> 22:07.242
You seem totally
unfazed by all this.

22:08.577 --> 22:10.620
It's God's plan.

22:20.881 --> 22:23.925
This election has
never been about me.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.344
It's about you.

22:36.105 --> 22:38.690
You understand that
in this election

22:38.774 --> 22:40.275
the greatest risk we can take

22:40.359 --> 22:42.151
is to try the same old politics

22:42.236 --> 22:46.197
with the same old players and
expect a different result.

22:50.452 --> 22:53.371
Change happens.

22:53.455 --> 22:56.708
Change happens because the
American people demand it...

22:58.419 --> 23:02.755
because they rise up and insist
on new ideas and new leadership

23:02.840 --> 23:05.466
and new politics for a new time.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.552
You're about to meet our nominee.

23:07.636 --> 23:11.556
You are the seventh and eighth
person to know about this.

23:11.640 --> 23:12.974
It's Steve.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.059
Come in.

23:15.144 --> 23:16.436
Because I've seen it...

23:16.520 --> 23:18.146
Hi. Come on in.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.024
I'm just watching Obama's
big, fancy speech again.

23:21.108 --> 23:23.776
Governor, this is Matthew Scully.

23:23.861 --> 23:25.981
- He'll be your main speechwriter.
- Nice to meet you.

23:26.001 --> 23:27.405
And this is Nicolle Wallace,

23:27.489 --> 23:29.732
former White House
communications director.

23:29.733 --> 23:30.733
Hi. How are you?

23:30.743 --> 23:32.744
And this is Governor Sarah Palin

23:32.828 --> 23:34.120
from Alaska.

23:34.204 --> 23:37.248
Yes, of course.
Congratulations, Governor.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.625
It's a real honour to meet you.

23:38.709 --> 23:40.376
Great to have you on board.

23:40.461 --> 23:42.754
Hey, come here.
Lookit. Look at this.

23:42.838 --> 23:46.758
I didn't know we were running
against a Greek god.

23:50.596 --> 23:53.514
They sure do love him.

23:53.599 --> 23:58.019
- They're gonna love you more.
- America, we cannot turn back.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.823
Governor, you are the nominee

24:10.908 --> 24:12.784
for the vice president
of the United States.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.370
You will no longer be
carrying your own bags.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.913
Yes, sir.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.706
And never call me sir.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.792
You can call me Steve, Schmidty,

24:20.876 --> 24:24.295
Kojak, Potsie, shithead...
anything you want.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.589
I will call you governor or ma'am.

24:26.674 --> 24:30.385
Well, I don't curse, so I'm
gonna have to call you Potsie.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.095
Very good, ma'am.

24:32.179 --> 24:34.430
These gentlemen are
Secret Service agents.

24:34.515 --> 24:35.974
They will take you into the arena.

24:36.058 --> 24:38.059
And if everything goes
according to plan,

24:38.143 --> 24:40.478
they will be with you
the rest of your life.

24:40.562 --> 24:42.563
Everything's gonna change

24:42.648 --> 24:45.108
the moment you walk out that door.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.068
Are you ready, Governor?

24:50.739 --> 24:52.156
I'm ready.

24:53.075 --> 24:54.659
Breathe.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.081
Welcome, Governor.

25:17.766 --> 25:19.600
Thank you.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.894
Thank you for that
wonderful welcome.

25:21.979 --> 25:25.773
I'm very happy today to
spend my birthday with you

25:25.858 --> 25:28.860
and to make a historic
announcement in Dayton...

25:30.529 --> 25:35.158
a city built on hard,
honest work of good people.

25:39.997 --> 25:41.998
The person I'm about
to introduce to you

25:42.082 --> 25:45.126
was a stand-out high
school point guard,

25:45.210 --> 25:48.546
a concerned citizen who became
a member of the P.T.A.,

25:48.630 --> 25:50.339
then a city council member...

25:50.424 --> 25:52.592
- Say a prayer.
- Then a mayor,

25:52.676 --> 25:56.095
- and now a governor.
- Say a prayer.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.598
- Say a prayer.
- Say a prayer.

25:58.682 --> 26:01.142
To celebrate the anniversary
of women's suffrage,

26:01.226 --> 26:04.687
a devoted wife and
a mother of five.

26:08.942 --> 26:11.569
My friends and fellow Americans,

26:11.653 --> 26:13.738
I am very pleased

26:13.822 --> 26:16.657
to introduce to you the
next vice president

26:16.742 --> 26:20.244
of the United States,

26:20.329 --> 26:23.748
Governor Sarah Palin of the
great state of Alaska.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.339
Just have fun.

26:47.231 --> 26:49.398
This is a fantastic
rollout, Steve.

26:49.483 --> 26:51.776
I can't believe you were
able to keep it a secret.

26:51.860 --> 26:54.821
I had to confiscate her
kids' cell phones.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.324
No hurry.

26:58.408 --> 27:00.660
- Thank you.
- All the way, Sarah.

27:00.744 --> 27:02.703
And I thank you, Senator McCain,

27:02.788 --> 27:05.832
for the confidence you
have placed in me.

27:05.916 --> 27:10.419
Senator, I am honoured to be
chosen as your running mate.

27:13.423 --> 27:16.175
It was rightly noted
in Denver this week

27:16.260 --> 27:19.428
that Hillary left
18 million cracks

27:19.513 --> 27:23.015
in the highest, hardest
glass ceiling in America.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.396
But it turns out

27:28.480 --> 27:30.773
the women of America
aren't finished yet

27:30.858 --> 27:34.569
and we can shatter that glass
ceiling once and for all.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.244
We gotta get her ready for
her convention speech.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.830
She'll need a vocal coach,
a foreign policy expert,

27:45.914 --> 27:47.999
hair and make-up
consultants and a stylist.

27:48.083 --> 27:49.792
No doubt.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.298
âª And if I was a movie star âª

27:58.260 --> 28:00.344
âª I'd sip honey
from a pickle jar âª

28:00.429 --> 28:03.681
âª In the back of my limousine âª

28:03.765 --> 28:06.517
âª And they'd call me an icon âª

28:08.979 --> 28:10.938
âª And I'd be looking back at you âª

28:11.023 --> 28:13.649
âª From the cover of
a People magazine âª

28:13.734 --> 28:15.193
Not... Not too tight.

28:15.277 --> 28:18.529
âª I guess it's all
for the taking âª

28:20.365 --> 28:22.575
I love these Johnny Choos.

28:25.204 --> 28:28.706
âª My sister says
I've got to see it âª

28:28.790 --> 28:31.667
âª And believe it,
and I believe it âª

28:31.752 --> 28:33.628
Oh, my gosh.

28:34.796 --> 28:37.298
âª I believe it âª

28:37.382 --> 28:40.051
- What do you think, Todd?
- It's cool.

28:41.803 --> 28:44.055
- Nice, Dad.
- Mum, you look beautiful.

28:44.139 --> 28:47.141
Aw, hey, look at you.
Look at your fancy shoes.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.268
- You look so awesome, Mum.
- Yeah, it really looks good.

28:49.353 --> 28:50.770
- You look great, Willow.
- Thanks.

28:50.854 --> 28:51.854
- So do you.
- So good.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.105
Look at Trig's little shirt.

28:53.190 --> 28:54.982
Okay, if you all come with me,

28:55.067 --> 28:56.651
it's time for your
campaign photos.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.028
- Bye, Mum.
- Okay. Let's go, guys.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.072
- See you in a bit, hon.
- Yeah.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.366
Governor, this is
your new staff...

29:03.450 --> 29:06.077
Tucker Eskew, Senior
Media Adviser.

29:06.161 --> 29:07.787
- It's a pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.511
Chris Edwards, your
deputy chief of staff.

29:09.581 --> 29:10.581
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:10.624 --> 29:12.041
And my husband, Mark Wallace,

29:12.125 --> 29:13.960
former ambassador to
the United Nations.

29:14.044 --> 29:15.461
He'll be a senior adviser.

29:15.545 --> 29:17.385
We're all honoured to be
on your team, Governor.

29:17.405 --> 29:19.990
- The honour is all mine.
- Shall we sit?

29:21.551 --> 29:24.595
Well, our first order
of business, Governor,

29:24.680 --> 29:27.098
is we need to find out

29:27.182 --> 29:29.725
if there are any
unexpected surprises.

29:29.810 --> 29:32.270
The press are gonna be
digging deep into your past,

29:32.354 --> 29:36.232
so we need to prepare answers
about your background.

29:36.316 --> 29:37.525
Oh, gosh.

29:37.609 --> 29:41.237
I can't think of anything I
haven't already disclosed.

29:42.906 --> 29:44.657
The Wasilla librarian
claims that as mayor

29:44.741 --> 29:46.221
she tried to ban
books. Is that true?

29:46.285 --> 29:49.328
What about the allegations that
Trig is not really her child?

29:49.413 --> 29:51.872
Did she attend a Pentecostal
church where they speak

29:51.957 --> 29:54.041
in tongues?

29:54.126 --> 29:55.909
This source we
talked to intimately

29:55.910 --> 29:57.295
involved in Palin's vetting

29:57.379 --> 29:59.297
admitted that aside from
those they talked to

29:59.381 --> 30:00.881
involved in so-called Troopergate,

30:00.966 --> 30:03.676
they didn't talk to any character
witnesses in Alaska...

30:05.178 --> 30:07.054
Why was the vet so bad?

30:07.139 --> 30:08.806
Listen, granted, he
only had a few days,

30:08.890 --> 30:10.891
but Culvahouse did clear her.

30:10.976 --> 30:12.201
Oh, with what? Wikipedia?

30:12.202 --> 30:14.061
There's no way this
vet was thorough.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.105
What? What did he miss?

30:16.189 --> 30:19.317
He had Troopergate. He
had Bridge to Nowhere.

30:19.401 --> 30:21.881
No one went to Alaska to interview
her colleagues, her enemies.

30:21.901 --> 30:23.863
There was no political
vet whatsoever.

30:23.947 --> 30:26.324
These charges are such bullshit.

30:26.408 --> 30:27.867
I mean, Trig isn't her baby?

30:27.951 --> 30:30.453
What, speaking in tongues?

30:30.537 --> 30:32.663
- She does.
- I don't care.

30:32.748 --> 30:34.388
Is the first amendment
no longer law here?

30:34.408 --> 30:36.500
Is she not entitled to
her religious beliefs?

30:36.585 --> 30:38.502
You're missing the point, Rick.

30:38.587 --> 30:41.505
John is getting slammed for
making an irresponsible choice.

30:41.590 --> 30:43.716
- We picked her.
- No, you two picked her,

30:43.800 --> 30:45.880
then slapped her on the butt
and shoved her out there

30:45.900 --> 30:47.887
under a banner saying
Country first.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.430
You're a real prick, Mark.

30:49.514 --> 30:50.931
- Fuck you, Schmidt.
- Fuck you.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.476
All right, all right. Let's
just get through this.

30:53.560 --> 30:54.935
Come on.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.812
Troopergate. What?

30:56.897 --> 30:58.105
The Alaska safety commissioner

30:58.190 --> 31:00.858
is claiming that he was fired
because he wouldn't fire.

31:00.942 --> 31:03.694
Palin's brother-in-law,
Trooper Mike Wooten.

31:03.779 --> 31:06.655
And what were the charges
against Trooper Wooten?

31:06.740 --> 31:08.908
Besides the fact that he was
divorcing Palin's sister?

31:08.992 --> 31:12.828
Yes. Do we have any
information that shows.

31:12.913 --> 31:15.122
Trooper Wooten should
have been fired?

31:15.207 --> 31:17.249
Yeah, Wooten was
accused of drinking

31:17.334 --> 31:19.085
from an open container
from his police car,

31:19.169 --> 31:21.212
Tasering his 11-year-old stepson,

31:21.296 --> 31:23.381
and illegally shooting a
moose without a permit.

31:23.465 --> 31:24.924
Jesus Christ.

31:25.008 --> 31:27.885
Okay, coordinate all responses
with their Alaskan council.

31:27.969 --> 31:30.096
Let's try to keep
it a local matter.

31:30.180 --> 31:32.390
Bridge to Nowhere. I thought
we were good on this.

31:32.474 --> 31:35.059
She had the project squashed
after she was elected,

31:35.143 --> 31:37.603
but ran on a platform
to build the bridge.

31:37.687 --> 31:39.021
It's a huge flip-flop.

31:39.106 --> 31:40.773
Goddamn it.

31:40.857 --> 31:43.317
How could she not tell us that?

31:43.402 --> 31:46.237
What the fuck is the
Alaska Independence Party

31:46.321 --> 31:47.863
and was she ever a member of it?

31:47.948 --> 31:50.408
The A.I.P. is a political
party whose sole platform

31:50.492 --> 31:53.911
is the secession of
Alaska from the union.

31:53.995 --> 31:55.413
Well, ain't that a hoot?

31:55.497 --> 31:58.124
Now, was she ever a member of it?

32:00.001 --> 32:02.211
Well?

32:02.295 --> 32:05.381
We know Todd Palin was a
member for many years.

32:05.465 --> 32:08.092
We can't confirm if she
was ever a member.

32:08.176 --> 32:11.595
Okay. Call our people
in Alaska right now

32:11.680 --> 32:13.264
and find out if she was.

32:13.348 --> 32:15.474
It's 3:00 a.m. in
Alaska right now.

32:15.559 --> 32:17.643
The phones don't
work there at night?

32:21.731 --> 32:24.650
We're under attack here, people.

32:24.734 --> 32:26.444
You're gonna have
to raise your game.

32:26.528 --> 32:28.863
I can assure you
that Obama's people

32:28.947 --> 32:30.364
are all over this shit.

32:30.449 --> 32:33.325
In the last 24 hours, I
have been asked questions

32:33.410 --> 32:36.912
by the national media that are
outrageous and disgusting.

32:36.997 --> 32:39.790
I have been asked when
her amniotic fluid

32:39.875 --> 32:42.585
started to leak with
regard to her last birth.

32:42.669 --> 32:44.086
It's shameful.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.713
So when did it start leaking?

32:45.797 --> 32:47.465
She's fought the oil companies.

32:47.549 --> 32:49.884
She's taken on corrupt
special interests.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.511
These accusations
are totally sexist.

32:52.596 --> 32:55.055
Never in my life have
I seen a candidate

32:55.140 --> 32:57.475
more attacked by
the liberal media.

32:57.559 --> 33:00.186
Smear after smear after smear.

33:00.270 --> 33:02.771
Are you sure we have to do this?

33:02.856 --> 33:04.616
Bristol couldn't stop
crying when I told her.

33:04.636 --> 33:06.025
It's going to come out tomorrow

33:06.109 --> 33:07.709
with or without our
statement, Governor.

33:07.729 --> 33:09.028
A positive from this

33:09.112 --> 33:10.992
is that given the timing
of Bristol's pregnancy,

33:11.072 --> 33:13.866
it makes it physically impossible
for Trig to be her baby.

33:13.950 --> 33:17.828
So we can put that
absurd rumour to rest.

33:17.913 --> 33:20.498
We're proud of Bristol's
decision to have her baby

33:20.582 --> 33:23.501
and even prouder to
become grandparents.

33:23.585 --> 33:25.169
We're not proud

33:25.253 --> 33:27.880
that our teenage daughter
is pregnant, Maria.

33:27.964 --> 33:30.174
And I don't want to send a
message that teen pregnancy

33:30.258 --> 33:32.343
is something to be proud of.

33:32.427 --> 33:34.094
I want that line out.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.514
Of course, Governor. I'll
change it right away.

33:38.433 --> 33:40.768
Governor Palin's 17-year-old
daughter Bristol

33:40.852 --> 33:43.854
has been seen holding her baby
brother Trig at campaign events.

33:43.939 --> 33:45.898
What the American people
didn't know until today

33:45.982 --> 33:48.692
is that Bristol is
five months pregnant.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.361
Her parents issued this statement:

33:50.445 --> 33:52.738
We're proud of Bristol's
decision to have her baby.

33:52.822 --> 33:54.615
I specifically wanted
that line taken out,

33:54.699 --> 33:56.259
and you ran it without
changing a word.

33:56.326 --> 33:57.535
You're absolutely right.

33:57.619 --> 33:59.745
The campaign takes full
responsibility on this.

33:59.829 --> 34:01.872
Maria's gonna personally
apologise to you.

34:01.957 --> 34:03.415
How the flip did this happen?

34:03.500 --> 34:05.084
Senator McCain is somewhat

34:05.168 --> 34:07.545
a fly-by-the-seat-
of-his-pants type of guy,

34:07.629 --> 34:10.109
and it does occasionally create
a little chaos in the campaign.

34:10.129 --> 34:11.799
Well, I want Maria gone.

34:11.882 --> 34:14.802
Governor, this was a mistake.
Maria feels terrible.

34:14.886 --> 34:17.304
She's an excellent
press secretary.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.348
My 17-year-old daughter
is being made fun of

34:19.431 --> 34:20.992
by every talk show
host in the country.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.936
I want Maria gone, period.

34:24.020 --> 34:27.147
Of course, Governor. She's gone.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.358
Done.

34:31.652 --> 34:33.070
Who makes that call?

34:33.154 --> 34:35.322
That'd be you.

34:35.407 --> 34:38.617
The idea that if something
happened to John McCain

34:38.702 --> 34:42.580
who is 72 years old and who has
had two bouts with melanoma,

34:42.664 --> 34:44.304
and she could step
into the presidency...

34:44.324 --> 34:45.583
it's just ridiculous.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.208
The real sequence, Rachel,

34:47.293 --> 34:49.628
is she said Please and Thank you,

34:49.713 --> 34:52.130
and then Thanks, but no thanks,

34:52.215 --> 34:56.927
only when the Congress had
de-authorised the bridge...

34:57.012 --> 34:59.430
Hi, Governor. I just
wanted to check in,

34:59.514 --> 35:01.849
make sure you're doing okay.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.934
Should John McCain consider
replacing Sarah Palin

35:04.019 --> 35:06.020
on the GOP ticket?

35:06.104 --> 35:07.521
I want to talk to the press.

35:07.606 --> 35:10.065
I want to set the record
straight on this stuff.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.861
I'll just go put Trig's p.j.'s on.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.613
Hey, there.

35:15.697 --> 35:18.240
- There you go, baby.
- Just gonna put your p.j.'s on.

35:18.325 --> 35:21.035
Now, we don't want you
to talk to anyone

35:21.119 --> 35:24.622
until after the convention

35:24.706 --> 35:28.125
because no one knows
anything about you.

35:28.209 --> 35:30.753
If you answer these
ridiculous allegations,

35:30.837 --> 35:34.965
you'll be defining yourself
in a defensive posture.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.800
But isn't the press
defining me right now?

35:36.885 --> 35:40.846
No news story lasts more
than 48 hours any more.

35:40.930 --> 35:43.140
News is no longer meant
to be remembered.

35:43.224 --> 35:44.642
It's just entertainment.

35:44.726 --> 35:47.645
So if you hit your convention
speech out of the park,

35:47.729 --> 35:52.650
the next news cycle will be
the comeback of Sarah Palin.

35:52.734 --> 35:55.653
Yeah. I can do that.

35:55.737 --> 35:59.323
Now, everyone's heard a lot
of crazy stories about you.

35:59.407 --> 36:02.576
Now it's time for you to tell
the world who you really are.

36:02.661 --> 36:07.539
You tell Senator McCain
I won't let him down.

36:07.624 --> 36:10.751
And good evening from the
G.O.P. Convention in St. Paul.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.836
All eyes will be on
Senator McCain's.

36:12.921 --> 36:15.130
V.P. choice, Governor Sarah Palin,

36:15.215 --> 36:17.091
when she takes the
stage at the R.N.C.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.176
She's likely never seen a night

36:19.260 --> 36:21.053
fraught with so much anticipation,

36:21.137 --> 36:22.971
expectation and pressure.

36:24.766 --> 36:27.810
The food's terrible, but I hear
it's gonna be worse in Iraq.

36:27.894 --> 36:31.522
- My boy's so brave.
- Come on, Mum.

36:35.819 --> 36:38.070
Thank you for inviting
me, Mrs Palin.

36:38.154 --> 36:40.072
Thank you for cutting
your mullet, Levi.

36:40.156 --> 36:41.865
I really appreciate it.

36:41.950 --> 36:43.534
I didn't really want to at first,

36:43.618 --> 36:46.453
but I think it looks
way better now.

36:46.538 --> 36:49.707
I think it does, too.

36:51.626 --> 36:53.252
Sorry to interrupt,

36:53.336 --> 36:56.046
but the Palins need
to go to their seats.

36:56.131 --> 36:57.965
- Bye, Mum.
- Okay.

37:06.725 --> 37:09.435
I don't know. I don't know.

37:09.519 --> 37:11.562
Hey, she's gonna be fine.

37:11.646 --> 37:14.231
- Really?
- Absolutely.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.776
Is she gonna be okay?

37:17.861 --> 37:20.487
I'm more concerned
about one-on-ones.

37:20.572 --> 37:21.989
How bad?

37:22.073 --> 37:25.242
I'm not sure how much she
knows about foreign policy.

37:25.326 --> 37:26.724
She didn't know why
North and South

37:26.725 --> 37:27.966
Korea were different countries.

37:29.706 --> 37:32.499
Okay, let's keep the
press away from her.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.585
We have five days to
bring her up to speed.

37:34.669 --> 37:36.086
She'll be fine.

37:36.171 --> 37:38.130
She's on in five minutes.
I gotta get up there.

37:38.214 --> 37:39.840
Good luck.

37:39.924 --> 37:42.092
In choosing Governor Sarah Palin

37:42.177 --> 37:45.512
as his running mate,
John McCain has chosen

37:45.597 --> 37:48.098
for the future.

37:48.183 --> 37:52.895
Governor Palin represents
a new generation.

37:52.979 --> 37:55.689
She's already one of the
most successful governors

37:55.774 --> 37:59.067
in America and the most popular.

38:02.280 --> 38:06.200
Let's get John McCain and
Sarah Palin elected,

38:06.284 --> 38:08.494
and let's shake up Washington

38:08.578 --> 38:11.455
and move this country forward.

38:13.208 --> 38:15.459
You're gonna do great.

38:17.754 --> 38:19.838
Ladies and gentlemen,

38:19.923 --> 38:22.007
the governor of Alaska

38:22.091 --> 38:26.178
and the next vice president
of the United States,

38:26.262 --> 38:29.223
Sarah Palin.

38:45.406 --> 38:48.200
Thank you.

38:48.284 --> 38:51.954
Mr Chairman, delegates,

38:52.038 --> 38:54.623
and fellow citizens,

38:54.707 --> 38:57.251
I will be honoured to
accept your nomination

38:57.335 --> 39:01.088
for vice president of
the United States.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.471
Thank you.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.895
Our nominee is a man

39:16.980 --> 39:20.190
who wore the uniform of
his country for 22 years

39:20.275 --> 39:24.111
and refused to break faith
with those troops in Iraq

39:24.195 --> 39:27.573
who now have brought
victory within sight.

39:27.657 --> 39:30.534
Good, good. She's really good.

39:30.618 --> 39:32.995
We were so blessed in April.

39:33.079 --> 39:35.873
Todd and I welcomed
our littlest one

39:35.957 --> 39:37.624
into the world...

39:37.709 --> 39:42.921
a perfectly beautiful
baby boy named Trig.

39:44.966 --> 39:46.550
Children with special needs

39:46.634 --> 39:49.928
inspire a very, very special love.

39:52.473 --> 39:54.975
She's amazing.

39:55.059 --> 39:57.477
To the families of
special-needs children

39:57.562 --> 40:01.940
all across this country, I
have a message for you.

40:02.025 --> 40:04.735
I pledge to you that
if we are elected,

40:04.819 --> 40:09.114
you will have a friend and
advocate in the White House.

40:09.198 --> 40:10.657
She's incredible.

40:12.118 --> 40:14.077
Before I became governor

40:14.162 --> 40:17.122
of the great state of Alaska...

40:18.708 --> 40:22.377
I was mayor of my home-town.

40:22.462 --> 40:25.297
I guess a small-town mayor

40:25.381 --> 40:29.843
is sort of like a
community organiser.

40:29.928 --> 40:34.723
Except that you have
actual responsibilities.

40:37.518 --> 40:39.895
Now I know why they call
her Sarah Barracuda.

40:42.482 --> 40:45.734
I love those hockey mums.

40:45.818 --> 40:47.299
You know what they
say the difference

40:47.300 --> 40:48.858
is between a hockey
mum and a pit bull?

40:48.863 --> 40:50.405
Lipstick.

40:50.490 --> 40:52.032
Yeah.

40:52.116 --> 40:54.117
She just came up with that.

40:54.202 --> 40:57.287
Join our cause and help America

40:57.372 --> 41:01.124
elect a great man as
the next president

41:01.209 --> 41:03.251
of the United States.

41:04.921 --> 41:06.463
Thank you.

41:06.547 --> 41:08.882
And God bless America.

41:08.967 --> 41:11.407
- Great job. She did a great job.
- Couldn't have gone better.

41:11.427 --> 41:13.345
- Congratulations.
- My God.

41:13.429 --> 41:14.930
She did it without a Teleprompter.

41:15.014 --> 41:16.454
It broke halfway
through her speech.

41:16.516 --> 41:17.766
- You're kidding.
- No.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.893
If that happens to me
tomorrow night, I'm fucked.

41:24.107 --> 41:25.315
We can win this.

41:25.400 --> 41:28.276
âª Oh, oh, oh âª

41:28.361 --> 41:29.903
âª And up, up, up âª

41:29.988 --> 41:32.489
âª Can only go up from here âª

41:32.573 --> 41:34.032
âª Up, up âª

41:34.117 --> 41:36.451
âª Up where the cloud's
gonna clear âª

41:36.536 --> 41:41.456
âª Up, up, there's no
way but up from here âª

41:41.541 --> 41:44.167
Thank you for calling. Yes,
we do take credit cards.

41:44.252 --> 41:46.628
- I'd be happy to...
- I've got $500.

41:46.713 --> 41:49.297
We're grateful for
every dollar we get.

41:49.382 --> 41:51.883
Yes, Sarah Palin will be giving
a speech in Florida next week.

41:51.968 --> 41:53.552
Thanks.

41:53.636 --> 41:56.138
Hey. Here we go.

41:56.222 --> 41:58.056
- Thanks for coming.
- I love you.

41:58.141 --> 42:02.060
Hi. Hey. Hi.

42:02.145 --> 42:04.771
- God, this is crazy.
- I know, they really love her.

42:06.607 --> 42:08.900
How are ya? Hey.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.404
- Hey, what's your name?
- I'm Sarah.

42:12.488 --> 42:13.697
- Sarah?
- Yeah.

42:13.781 --> 42:16.408
That's my name, too.
That's amazing.

42:16.492 --> 42:18.201
- I know.
- Oh.

42:18.286 --> 42:19.703
Hey, thanks for coming out.

42:19.787 --> 42:21.705
Thank you. We never felt
welcome to go anywhere

42:21.789 --> 42:23.540
before we saw you
give that speech.

42:23.624 --> 42:25.959
Oh, thank you. Thanks so much.

42:26.044 --> 42:28.378
Look at you. I want to
look at how handsome

42:28.463 --> 42:31.048
my son Trig's gonna be
when he's all grown up.

42:31.132 --> 42:33.925
She understands that you can't
solve problems with government,

42:34.010 --> 42:35.552
that government is the problem.

42:35.636 --> 42:38.722
When she talks about her faith,
you can tell it's for real.

42:38.806 --> 42:41.808
When she talks about guns,
you can tell it's for real.

42:41.893 --> 42:43.727
I've got five kids, too,

42:43.811 --> 42:45.228
and there's something about her...

42:45.313 --> 42:48.315
She's talking to me. And
nobody talks to me.

42:51.986 --> 42:54.321
CNN has us even with Obama.

42:54.405 --> 42:57.282
- Are you kidding me?
- Hey, Gallup has us up by five.

42:57.366 --> 42:58.909
She's given us exactly
what we needed.

42:58.993 --> 43:00.911
We've made more money
in the last few days

43:00.995 --> 43:02.454
than we did all last month.

43:02.538 --> 43:04.414
I've never seen crowds
like this in my life.

43:04.499 --> 43:07.417
- They love her.
- She's a bigger star than Obama.

43:07.502 --> 43:09.669
We can really win this thing.

43:16.344 --> 43:17.928
I really understand your frustr...

43:18.012 --> 43:19.846
I'm sorry, Pool. It's
not gonna happen today.

43:19.931 --> 43:21.348
Sorry.

43:21.432 --> 43:23.558
- Five minutes.
- Views matter.

43:23.643 --> 43:26.353
Did you know that Todd
Palin is an Eskimo?

43:26.437 --> 43:28.855
Oh, yeah, Steve? That's
really interesting.

43:28.940 --> 43:31.775
Seriously, he's a Yupik Eskimo.

43:31.859 --> 43:33.610
We're gonna take some serious
blowback from the press

43:33.694 --> 43:35.445
if we don't let them
speak to her soon.

43:35.530 --> 43:37.864
- They're really getting pissed.
- I know, yeah.

43:37.949 --> 43:39.825
Well, I don't know
how ready she is.

43:39.909 --> 43:42.327
Nicolle, you worry too much.

43:42.411 --> 43:44.663
We always knew she'd be
weak on foreign policy.

43:44.747 --> 43:46.456
We'll get her up to speed.

43:46.541 --> 43:50.127
Steve, I don't think foreign
policy is her only weakness.

43:52.213 --> 43:53.630
Sorry to bother you, Governor.

43:53.714 --> 43:55.799
Is now an okay time to talk?

43:55.883 --> 43:58.343
Sure, I'm just reading the e-mails
from the Prayer Warriors.

43:58.427 --> 44:00.303
These guys are awesome.

44:00.388 --> 44:02.806
I just want to take a
moment to inform you

44:02.890 --> 44:05.809
of how thrilled Senator McCain is.

44:05.893 --> 44:08.520
You're exceeding his
wildest expectation

44:08.604 --> 44:10.272
for what a running
mate could achieve.

44:10.356 --> 44:12.357
I am so happy to hear that.

44:12.441 --> 44:14.860
These are the largest
crowds I've ever seen

44:14.944 --> 44:16.820
in my entire political
career, ever.

44:16.904 --> 44:18.613
Really? Yeah, I just...

44:18.698 --> 44:21.074
I just love talking to
people on the rope lines,

44:21.159 --> 44:22.534
getting to hear their problems.

44:22.618 --> 44:25.162
It's really moving to me.

44:25.246 --> 44:26.830
Well, you know, that comes across.

44:26.914 --> 44:29.291
You're a transformative
figure, Governor.

44:29.375 --> 44:32.586
You... You could be the
party's next Ronald Reagan.

44:32.670 --> 44:35.213
Holy geez, I...

44:35.298 --> 44:38.175
Yeah, he's... he's my hero, so...

44:38.259 --> 44:41.303
Mine, too. So...

44:41.387 --> 44:44.514
The next step is just... We're
gonna start doing some interviews.

44:44.599 --> 44:46.683
Great. I've been dying
to talk to the press.

44:46.767 --> 44:49.227
Also, I feel like I could
really help you there.

44:49.312 --> 44:52.689
I've always been very, very
open with the press in Alaska.

44:52.773 --> 44:54.858
The reasoning behind
holding you back

44:54.942 --> 44:57.360
is the entire press corps
is in the tank for Obama,

44:57.445 --> 44:58.862
so all they want in life

44:58.946 --> 45:01.239
is to trip you up with
obscure questions.

45:01.324 --> 45:03.033
- Gotcha questions.
- Gotcha questions.

45:03.117 --> 45:05.037
So we just want to make
sure you're fully prepped

45:05.119 --> 45:06.703
before we unleash them.

45:06.787 --> 45:08.747
What about the local
Alaska papers?

45:08.831 --> 45:10.790
There are no local
papers any more.

45:10.875 --> 45:13.919
Anything you say goes national
the instant you say it.

45:14.003 --> 45:15.212
Yeah, got it.

45:15.296 --> 45:18.423
Okay, so I think the
best way to prep

45:18.507 --> 45:20.550
would just be to go through
some sample questions.

45:20.635 --> 45:22.052
Sure, let's do it.

45:22.136 --> 45:25.055
Let's start with something simple.

45:25.139 --> 45:28.558
How do you plan on maintaining

45:28.643 --> 45:31.144
our alliance with Great
Britain on Iraq,

45:31.229 --> 45:33.021
even though support
for the war there

45:33.105 --> 45:34.481
is at an all-time low?

45:34.565 --> 45:38.902
I think the United States
has always maintained

45:38.986 --> 45:40.570
a great relationship
with the queen.

45:40.655 --> 45:43.490
And John McCain will
continue to have

45:43.574 --> 45:45.325
an open dialogue with her.

45:46.494 --> 45:47.911
Governor,

45:47.995 --> 45:50.789
the queen is not the head
of government in England.

45:50.873 --> 45:52.249
She's the head of state.

45:52.333 --> 45:54.751
Well, then, who's the
head of government?

45:56.212 --> 45:58.129
The prime minister.

46:20.111 --> 46:21.361
You rang?

46:21.445 --> 46:23.697
The cavalry has arrived.

46:23.781 --> 46:25.439
Thank you, gentlemen. Come on in.

46:25.440 --> 46:26.474
You bet.

46:26.475 --> 46:27.492
Yeah.

46:35.751 --> 46:37.627
Well, I...

46:37.712 --> 46:39.629
I think we should start
by prepping the governor

46:39.714 --> 46:41.840
with Russian economic policy

46:41.924 --> 46:44.301
as it relates to
post-cold war tensions

46:44.385 --> 46:46.136
during the pre-Putin era.

46:46.220 --> 46:49.472
I was thinking something
a little bit simpler.

46:49.557 --> 46:50.724
How much simpler?

46:50.808 --> 46:53.268
This is Germany.

46:53.352 --> 46:55.645
They were the primary antagonists

46:55.730 --> 46:58.106
during World War I
and World War II.

46:58.190 --> 47:00.233
And in World War II,
they were aligned with

47:00.318 --> 47:04.654
Japan and Italy to form
what was known as the Axis.

47:04.739 --> 47:06.156
Okay.

47:08.743 --> 47:09.993
Currently, we're in the middle

47:10.077 --> 47:12.329
of what I like to
call the three wars.

47:12.413 --> 47:16.875
That's Afghanistan, Iraq, and
the global war on terror.

47:16.959 --> 47:20.378
Governor, would you... would
you like to take a break?

47:20.463 --> 47:23.673
No way. This is flipping awesome.

47:28.054 --> 47:31.014
Now, with Afghanistan,
after 9/11...

47:31.098 --> 47:33.391
already put a protective wall up

47:33.476 --> 47:36.311
around the family,
especially the key players.

47:36.395 --> 47:39.564
Look at Bristol, Sarah Palin's
daughter, who is pregnant.

47:39.648 --> 47:41.856
We've seen her, we've
seen her boyfriend

47:41.857 --> 47:43.526
Levi, the father of her child,

47:43.611 --> 47:45.820
but we haven't really
gotten to talk to them

47:45.905 --> 47:47.947
about whose idea it
was to get married

47:48.032 --> 47:50.825
and why, for example,
Levi on his Myspace page

47:50.910 --> 47:53.110
- says he doesn't want kids...
- That isn't anybody's...

47:53.130 --> 47:56.246
Why won't they just
leave me alone?

47:56.290 --> 47:59.667
I'm so tired of it.

47:59.752 --> 48:02.295
Any grown-up who makes
fun of a teenage girl

48:02.380 --> 48:04.047
is a terrible person.

48:04.131 --> 48:06.216
And we'll forget what
she said, honey, okay?

48:06.300 --> 48:07.717
Okay?

48:07.802 --> 48:10.387
My e-mails were hacked.

48:10.471 --> 48:13.014
I know, Governor, and we're
on it. I promise you.

48:13.099 --> 48:14.739
Did you know that my
daughter's cell phone

48:14.759 --> 48:16.601
is online and she's
getting crank calls?

48:16.685 --> 48:20.980
Did you know that my family
is being threatened?

48:21.065 --> 48:24.567
Governor, you have every right
to be upset, and I am sorry.

48:24.652 --> 48:27.070
I've already contacted
Secret Service

48:27.154 --> 48:28.863
and they're gonna
increase security.

48:28.948 --> 48:31.658
Can you... Can you protect
my e-mails, Steve?

48:31.742 --> 48:34.577
Can you... Can this campaign

48:34.662 --> 48:36.287
at least do that?

48:42.878 --> 48:44.170
Charlie Gibson is good,

48:44.255 --> 48:46.798
so I'm sure the questions
will have some depth.

48:46.882 --> 48:49.134
Don't be afraid to elaborate
if it's a subject

48:49.218 --> 48:51.010
you feel comfortable
with, like energy.

48:53.431 --> 48:55.306
Are you okay, Governor?

48:55.391 --> 48:59.269
Why aren't there any McCain-Palin
lawn signs in Alaska?

48:59.353 --> 49:02.313
Well, Mr Obama

49:02.398 --> 49:04.315
has five times the money we have.

49:04.400 --> 49:07.277
Five times, and...

49:07.361 --> 49:11.030
Alaska is only three electoral
votes, and it's solid red.

49:11.115 --> 49:13.158
I'm concerned about my
standing back home.

49:13.242 --> 49:14.617
Todd and I are hearing things,

49:14.702 --> 49:16.995
and I can't talk to
the Alaskan press.

49:17.079 --> 49:18.371
What are you hearing?

49:18.456 --> 49:20.540
Things. None of it's good.

49:20.624 --> 49:23.877
Can you at least do a poll to
check my approval rating there?

49:23.961 --> 49:26.796
Governor, that would cost
the campaign $60,000.

49:26.881 --> 49:28.840
I'd feel a heck of a lot better

49:28.924 --> 49:31.050
if I knew where I was at.

49:33.304 --> 49:35.847
Absolutely. We will do the poll

49:35.931 --> 49:37.640
for your peace of
mind, just this once.

49:37.725 --> 49:39.142
Great. Thank you.

49:39.226 --> 49:41.478
So, can we get back to
prepping Charlie Gibson?

49:41.562 --> 49:43.021
Sure, I'm ready. Let's do it.

49:43.105 --> 49:45.607
- You ready?
- Yes.

49:47.526 --> 49:49.194
Do you think the Fed
did the right thing

49:49.278 --> 49:51.158
in their dealing with the
Bear Stearns collapse?

49:52.907 --> 49:56.201
Our economy is hurting, and
the federal government

49:56.285 --> 49:58.244
has not provided the
sound oversight

49:58.329 --> 50:00.705
that we need and that we deserve.

50:00.789 --> 50:04.083
I think we need a
little bit of reality

50:04.168 --> 50:05.668
from Wasilla Main Street there

50:05.753 --> 50:09.672
brought to Washington, DC,
so that the people there

50:09.757 --> 50:13.593
can understand how the
average working-class family

50:13.677 --> 50:16.513
is viewing bureaucracy in
the federal government.

50:16.597 --> 50:18.681
Governor...

50:18.766 --> 50:20.058
do you know what the Fed is?

50:22.770 --> 50:24.020
In what respect, Charlie?

50:24.104 --> 50:26.439
No, no. This is me, Steve,

50:26.524 --> 50:28.608
asking do you know
what the Fed is?

50:36.116 --> 50:38.618
Stands for the Federal
Reserve System.

50:38.702 --> 50:41.287
No, please. Don't
write, just listen.

50:41.372 --> 50:44.666
The Fed is responsible
for all monetary policy

50:44.750 --> 50:46.167
in the United States.

50:46.252 --> 50:48.044
On any Fed or Bear
Stearns question,

50:48.128 --> 50:49.848
just say the Fed took
the appropriate action

50:49.868 --> 50:52.298
that was needed at the time.

50:52.383 --> 50:53.716
Okay?

50:56.595 --> 50:58.221
Got it.

51:01.100 --> 51:04.227
Your oldest son is proudly
heading off to Iraq next week.

51:04.311 --> 51:07.021
Who do you see as the primary
enemy at this point?

51:07.106 --> 51:10.233
Radical Islamic extremists.

51:10.317 --> 51:11.901
Can you be more specific?

51:11.986 --> 51:14.028
The terrorists who are hell-bent

51:14.113 --> 51:16.364
on destroying our nation.

51:16.448 --> 51:18.157
Governor, do you know
why we're in Iraq?

51:18.242 --> 51:22.203
Because Saddam Hussein
attacked us on 9/11.

51:22.288 --> 51:24.664
No. No,

51:24.748 --> 51:26.874
Al-Qaeda attacked us on 9/11.

51:26.959 --> 51:28.418
Not Saddam Hussein.

51:28.502 --> 51:30.003
No, it was Al-Qaeda.

51:30.087 --> 51:32.505
And that's why we're
in Afghanistan.

51:32.590 --> 51:34.465
Do you know the
primary differences

51:34.550 --> 51:36.676
between the war in Afghanistan
and the war in Iraq?

51:40.347 --> 51:44.392
Excuse us for a moment.

51:52.484 --> 51:54.777
Can I get some more information
about Afghanistan?

51:54.862 --> 51:56.654
Of course, Governor.

52:06.832 --> 52:08.958
- Should we cancel?
- We can't.

52:09.043 --> 52:11.044
Even Fox is pounding
us for hiding her.

52:11.128 --> 52:13.504
- We'd get murdered.
- When you interviewed her,

52:13.589 --> 52:15.590
didn't you ask her about
national security?

52:15.674 --> 52:18.843
Foreign policy, domestic policy?

52:18.927 --> 52:20.637
I thought Culvahouse
would cover that.

52:20.721 --> 52:22.555
So what did you ask her?

52:22.640 --> 52:26.017
I just... We talked
about if she would

52:26.101 --> 52:29.020
back John's positions when
they conflicted with hers

52:29.104 --> 52:31.439
or if she was prepared
for her life to change.

52:31.523 --> 52:33.983
There were no policy questions.

52:34.068 --> 52:37.654
You guys didn't grill her
because you wanted it to work.

52:37.738 --> 52:40.406
I wasn't in charge
of the vet, Nicolle.

52:46.121 --> 52:47.789
She's a great actress, right?

52:47.873 --> 52:50.124
Oh, the best.

52:50.209 --> 52:52.919
Why don't we just
give her some lines?

52:59.218 --> 53:00.885
I've come up with a
list of questions

53:00.969 --> 53:02.720
that I think Charlie's
most likely to ask.

53:02.805 --> 53:04.222
If you memorise these answers,

53:04.306 --> 53:06.066
I'm sure you're going
to nail this interview.

53:06.086 --> 53:07.433
How do you know he'll ask these?

53:07.518 --> 53:09.318
I was the White House
communications director.

53:09.338 --> 53:11.187
It's my job to figure
out the questions.

53:11.271 --> 53:12.689
Shushkashvili.

53:12.773 --> 53:14.982
Saakashvili, the
president of Georgia.

53:15.067 --> 53:16.693
Shashkashvili.

53:16.777 --> 53:18.736
Saakashvith...

53:18.821 --> 53:21.531
- Saakashvili.
- Saakash-vili.

53:21.615 --> 53:23.574
Let me ask you about some specific

53:23.659 --> 53:25.179
- national security situations.
- Sure.

53:25.199 --> 53:26.953
Let's start with
Russia and Georgia.

53:27.037 --> 53:29.038
Do you believe the United States

53:29.123 --> 53:31.290
should try to restore
Georgian sovereignty

53:31.375 --> 53:33.751
over South Ossetia and Abkhazia?

53:33.836 --> 53:35.211
First off, we're gonna continue

53:35.295 --> 53:36.815
good relations with
Saakashvili there.

53:36.880 --> 53:39.382
I was able to speak
with him the other day,

53:39.466 --> 53:41.676
and we've gotta keep
an eye on Russia.

53:41.760 --> 53:44.053
For Russia to have
exerted such pressure

53:44.138 --> 53:48.766
in terms of invading a smaller
democratic country unprovoked

53:48.851 --> 53:51.091
- is unacceptable, and we have...
- You believe unprovoked?

53:51.145 --> 53:53.396
- Yes.
- I do, I do believe unprovoked.

53:53.480 --> 53:55.106
And we have to keep
our eye on Russia...

53:55.190 --> 53:56.524
She's a red-light performer.

53:56.608 --> 53:58.568
Under the leadership there.

53:58.652 --> 54:00.570
What insight into Russian actions,

54:00.654 --> 54:02.254
particularly in the
last couple of weeks,

54:02.281 --> 54:06.075
does the proximity of
this state give you?

54:06.160 --> 54:07.827
They're our next-door neighbours.

54:07.911 --> 54:11.539
And you can actually see Russia
from land here in Alaska.

54:11.623 --> 54:13.667
Do you consider a nuclear Iran...

54:13.668 --> 54:14.698
Damn it.

54:14.699 --> 54:16.288
To be an existential
threat to Israel?

54:16.308 --> 54:18.643
And I can see Russia
from my house.

54:27.014 --> 54:30.600
I believe global warming
is caused by man.

54:30.684 --> 54:34.103
And I believe it's just
God hugging us closer.

54:36.774 --> 54:39.817
I don't agree with
the Bush doctrine.

54:39.902 --> 54:41.694
And I don't know what that is.

54:44.364 --> 54:46.282
She initially did not
understand this,

54:46.366 --> 54:48.701
and I think that people can
make what they want of it,

54:48.786 --> 54:50.225
but was I, or anyone,
confident that

54:50.226 --> 54:51.626
Sarah Palin now has
the wherewithal

54:51.705 --> 54:53.865
to be president of the United
States? I don't think so.

54:53.874 --> 54:56.667
A conservative friend called me
up and said I just can't do it.

54:56.752 --> 54:59.712
I don't know if I'm voting for
Obama, but I can't have her...

54:59.797 --> 55:02.157
She shouldn't be in Washington,
let alone the White House.

55:10.474 --> 55:12.475
Governor.

55:14.353 --> 55:16.729
Governor Palin.

55:22.569 --> 55:25.530
We really should prep for
your Katie Couric interview.

55:29.743 --> 55:30.910
Fine.

55:32.579 --> 55:34.747
I wrote a brief synopsis
on the collapse

55:34.832 --> 55:37.333
of Lehman Brothers and
the financial crisis.

55:37.417 --> 55:38.835
If you internalise this document,

55:38.919 --> 55:42.088
you should be able to field basic
questions about the bailout.

55:53.809 --> 55:55.893
Governor...

55:55.978 --> 55:58.354
the Dow just dropped 500 points.

55:58.438 --> 56:00.731
Lehman is collapsing.

56:00.816 --> 56:02.692
The world economy is on
the brink of collapse.

56:02.776 --> 56:05.528
I am pretty sure the bailout
is going to come up...

56:10.409 --> 56:12.702
Okay.

56:17.291 --> 56:19.834
Why don't we come back to it
after we've warmed up a bit?

56:23.797 --> 56:26.132
I've put together a list
of the questions...

56:26.216 --> 56:28.551
that Katie's most likely to ask.

56:28.635 --> 56:31.220
I used to work with Katie, and I
know she'll ask about abortion.

56:31.305 --> 56:33.848
Did Steve do the Alaska poll yet?

56:33.932 --> 56:35.849
I think it's being
done as we speak.

56:35.850 --> 56:37.226
Bet he didn't even do it.

56:41.481 --> 56:44.734
Can we try and get through
just a few questions?

56:51.491 --> 56:54.327
I know you're upset, Governor.

56:54.411 --> 56:56.120
So why don't you get a
good night's sleep,

56:56.204 --> 56:58.044
and I will come back first
thing in the morning

56:58.064 --> 56:59.814
to prep you when
you're feeling better?

57:08.592 --> 57:11.177
I'm gonna leave this for you to...

57:12.054 --> 57:14.513
look over.

57:17.351 --> 57:20.978
It's the worst financial crisis
facing the American people

57:21.063 --> 57:23.940
since the great depression
of the 1920s and '30s.

57:24.024 --> 57:26.108
The president's massive
financial rescue plan

57:26.193 --> 57:28.402
under fire from the
left and right.

57:28.487 --> 57:30.112
Good evening from the Ford Centre

57:30.197 --> 57:32.406
at the University of
Mississippi at Oxford.

57:32.491 --> 57:34.283
We're here for the
first of three debates

57:34.368 --> 57:36.035
between Senator Barack Obama...

57:36.119 --> 57:37.919
Steve, Steve, let's not
worry about that crap.

57:37.996 --> 57:39.622
It's all bullshit.

57:39.706 --> 57:41.290
I'm here at the podium.

57:41.375 --> 57:43.709
Let's do the fucking debate.

57:45.045 --> 57:46.671
Hey, John. Sorry to interrupt.

57:46.755 --> 57:49.632
I just spoke to our
guy at Treasury.

57:49.716 --> 57:52.134
The bill does not have
enough Republican votes.

57:52.219 --> 57:53.803
Goddamn it.

57:53.887 --> 57:55.846
Paulson thinks the
entire world economy

57:55.931 --> 57:58.891
is on the brink of falling
off the cliff, so...

57:58.976 --> 58:02.311
We're checkmated. If the
bailout doesn't pass,

58:02.396 --> 58:04.271
we're screwed because
Bush, and thus you,

58:04.356 --> 58:06.315
will be blamed for it.

58:06.400 --> 58:09.026
- If you pass the bailout...
- The Republicans will despise me

58:09.111 --> 58:11.320
- for supporting a bailout.
- That's it.

58:12.739 --> 58:14.448
This is it, guys.

58:14.533 --> 58:16.993
I mean, this is the
whole fucking election.

58:17.077 --> 58:20.079
Now, we think you should
suspend the campaign,

58:20.163 --> 58:22.540
postpone the debates,
go to Washington,

58:22.624 --> 58:25.418
and try to negotiate a
bipartisan compromise.

58:26.712 --> 58:29.088
You need to make a
bold move, John.

58:31.133 --> 58:33.134
This is a big risk.

58:33.218 --> 58:35.761
I mean, that's a big gamble.

58:37.305 --> 58:39.140
We gotta do something.

58:39.224 --> 58:42.643
I mean, nothing can
fuck me more than this.

58:42.728 --> 58:44.020
Governor, have you had a chance

58:44.104 --> 58:46.647
to go over the briefing
materials on the bailout?

58:49.276 --> 58:51.152
I really think we need
to try and nail down

58:51.236 --> 58:53.696
a simple two-sentence response
to the economic crisis.

58:53.780 --> 58:55.575
It's gotta be supportive
of the concept...

58:55.576 --> 58:56.576
That's enough powder.

58:56.616 --> 58:58.201
Of the bailout, but
also disappointed

58:58.202 --> 58:59.285
that we're at this point,

58:59.369 --> 59:02.538
making it clear that changes
need to be made to the bill.

59:04.166 --> 59:05.458
Oh, you need it a little higher?

59:05.542 --> 59:08.377
I can do that. I can
do that for you.

59:09.629 --> 59:11.797
That jacket looks fantastic
on you, by the way.

59:11.882 --> 59:13.966
It's too open.

59:14.051 --> 59:16.635
- Don't you think so?
- Yeah, it looks wonderful.

59:16.720 --> 59:18.262
Really great, really nice.

59:18.346 --> 59:20.014
It's a great colour.

59:26.438 --> 59:28.647
Do you want me to read
the paper to you?

59:33.987 --> 59:35.889
Senator John McCain
has requested of

59:35.890 --> 59:37.740
his opponent, Senator
Barack Obama,

59:37.824 --> 59:40.242
a postponement of
the upcoming debate

59:40.327 --> 59:42.787
so that both senators may
return to Capitol Hill

59:42.871 --> 59:45.581
to address the needs of the
country in this crucial time.

59:45.665 --> 59:47.333
Senator Obama has said...

59:53.006 --> 59:55.216
I hate this make-up. I hate it.

59:55.300 --> 59:57.843
I don't like my hair this
way. I like my hair up.

59:57.928 --> 59:59.553
Governor, you look amazing.

59:59.638 --> 01:00:03.641
I look fat. I'm sick
of looking fat.

01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:06.519
- You don't look fat...
- Can I get some more tape?

01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:11.023
Yeah.

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:12.858
I don't know if we
should do Couric.

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:14.610
She's having a mini-meltdown.

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:16.779
Well, we can't have
McCain cancel the debate

01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:19.824
and Palin cancel Katie
Couric in the same week.

01:00:19.908 --> 01:00:21.492
I know,

01:00:21.576 --> 01:00:23.119
but I'm really worried about her.

01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:25.996
She won't respond
to anything I say.

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:28.241
Maybe we should bring McCain
in and see what he thinks.

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:29.792
He doesn't want to deal with her.

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:32.670
I haven't even told him that
she doesn't know anything.

01:00:32.754 --> 01:00:34.964
You haven't told him?

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:37.758
Look, he doesn't want to know.

01:00:37.843 --> 01:00:39.844
The world economy is on
the brink of collapse.

01:00:39.928 --> 01:00:43.430
Can you just... prep her
in the car ride over?

01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:47.309
I can try.

01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:51.689
Okay, good. Try. Thanks.

01:00:51.773 --> 01:00:53.607
Knowing Katie, I'm sure
she's going to ask

01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:55.359
about your stance on feminism.

01:00:55.443 --> 01:00:57.361
- Did you get the numbers?
- The what?

01:00:57.445 --> 01:01:00.489
My approval rating in Alaska.

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:02.658
They're not in yet.

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:04.326
I am trying to trust you people,

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:06.996
but you're making it
really hard for me.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.747
I'm sorry, Governor.

01:01:09.749 --> 01:01:11.375
I'll call Steve right
away about it.

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:13.169
Yeah, like that'll do anything.

01:01:17.132 --> 01:01:19.133
What are you working on, Governor?

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.549
It's a questionnaire
from the Mat-Su

01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:24.096
Valley Frontiersman in Wasilla.

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:26.348
You know, an Alaska paper.

01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:27.892
Don't you think we should prepare

01:01:27.976 --> 01:01:29.977
for your national
Couric interview first?

01:01:30.061 --> 01:01:33.230
No, Nicolle, I don't.
This is my priority.

01:01:33.315 --> 01:01:38.527
I am not going to ignore the
people of Alaska any more.

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:51.540
You've cited Alaska's
proximity to Russia

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:53.918
as part of your foreign
policy experience.

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:55.127
What did you mean by that?

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:59.048
That Alaska has a very
narrow maritime border

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:02.801
between a foreign country,
Russia, and on our other side,

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:06.805
the land boundary that
we have with Canada.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.516
It's funny that a
comment like that

01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:14.188
was kind of made to...

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:15.731
I don't know. You know, reporters.

01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:17.566
- Mocked?
- Yeah, mocked.

01:02:17.651 --> 01:02:18.851
I guess that's the word, yeah.

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:21.320
Well, explain to me
why that enhances

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:23.405
your foreign policy credentials.

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:27.243
Well, it certainly
does because our...

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:29.787
our next-door neighbours
are foreign countries.

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:33.832
They're in the state that
I am the executive of.

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:36.669
Have you ever been involved
with any negotiations,

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:38.420
for example, with the Russians?

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:40.589
We have trade missions
back and forth.

01:02:40.674 --> 01:02:42.299
We do. It's very important

01:02:42.384 --> 01:02:45.636
when you consider even national
security issues with Russia,

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.139
as Putin rears his head and
comes into the airspace

01:02:49.224 --> 01:02:51.267
of the United States of America,

01:02:51.351 --> 01:02:53.435
where do they go?

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.188
It's Alaska. It's just
right over the border.

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:58.732
And when it comes to
establishing your world view,

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:02.111
I was curious... what
newspapers and magazines

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:06.448
did you regularly read before
you were tapped for this

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:08.367
to stay informed and
to understand...

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:11.412
I've read most of them, again
with a great appreciation

01:03:11.496 --> 01:03:13.497
for the press, for the media.

01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:15.916
What ones specifically?
I'm curious.

01:03:16.001 --> 01:03:17.668
Name one fucking paper.

01:03:17.752 --> 01:03:19.670
All of 'em. Any of 'em

01:03:19.754 --> 01:03:22.715
that have been in front of
me over all these years.

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:25.718
Oh, my God. What have we done?

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:28.554
If John McCain wins,
this woman will be

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:31.265
one 72-year-old's heartbeat away

01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:33.726
from being president
of the United States.

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:36.312
And if that doesn't scare the
hell out of you, it should.

01:03:36.396 --> 01:03:38.647
In fairness, probably most people

01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:40.858
can't name a Supreme Court case.

01:03:40.942 --> 01:03:43.652
But most people are
not campaigning

01:03:43.737 --> 01:03:45.279
- to be vice president.
- Right, right.

01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:47.865
It's not that she doesn't
know the right answer.

01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:51.035
It's that she clearly does
not understand the question.

01:03:51.119 --> 01:03:54.663
This is way beyond
anything we have ever seen

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:56.415
from a national candidate.

01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:02.823
Why'd you make me do Katie Couric?

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:05.758
Did you see the coverage? Did you?

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:07.885
Are you there? Are
you listening to me?

01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:10.137
Yes, Governor. I'm here.

01:04:10.221 --> 01:04:11.764
Katie was a logical choice.

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:13.728
She's been very fair to
us this entire campaign.

01:04:13.813 --> 01:04:15.105
You call that interview fair?

01:04:15.189 --> 01:04:16.685
Yes, Governor, I do.

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:19.480
I certainly don't. She was out
to get me from the get-go.

01:04:19.564 --> 01:04:20.981
No, she wasn't.

01:04:21.066 --> 01:04:22.786
The interview sucked
because you didn't try.

01:04:22.806 --> 01:04:24.318
What do you mean, I didn't try?

01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:27.042
You didn't fight back like you did
in the Charlie Gibson interview.

01:04:27.127 --> 01:04:28.608
When you didn't know
the answers, you

01:04:28.609 --> 01:04:30.127
clawed your way back
and it went fine.

01:04:30.147 --> 01:04:31.492
You just gave up.

01:04:31.576 --> 01:04:33.118
Nicolle, it wasn't my fault.

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:35.454
I wasn't properly prepped.

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:38.499
You weren't properly prepped
because you wouldn't listen to us.

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:40.542
You never listen to your advisers.

01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:42.544
Because you're overwhelming me

01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:44.546
with too much information.

01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:46.548
I don't want to do
these interviews.

01:04:46.633 --> 01:04:48.717
I want to do what I want to do.

01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:51.929
We're just trying to help you
get through this, Governor.

01:04:52.013 --> 01:04:53.847
All we want is for you to succeed.

01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:55.849
Yeah, well, you're not helping.

01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:57.851
You're just screwing me up.

01:04:57.936 --> 01:05:00.938
You're telling me what to say,
what to wear, how to talk.

01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:03.023
I am not your puppet.

01:05:03.108 --> 01:05:04.525
Now I understand
what Hillary meant

01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:06.329
when she said she had
to find her own voice.

01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:09.947
Yeah, because you're
just like Hillary.

01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:14.368
You have ruined me.

01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:16.662
You have ruined my reputation.

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:18.997
I am ruined in Alaska.

01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:32.094
This is Steve Schmidt.
Leave a message.

01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:34.138
Steve, it's Nicolle.

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:36.598
I will gladly resign if you
want to blame me for Couric.

01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:39.560
But if you want me to stay, then
I'm back on McCain's bus tomorrow

01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:41.979
as I never want to deal
with that woman ever again.

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:46.608
What lessons have you
learned from Iraq

01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:50.696
and how specifically would
you spread democracy abroad?

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.699
Specifically, we would
make every effort possible

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:56.368
to spread democracy abroad
to those who want it.

01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:03.250
Yes, but specifically,
what would you do?

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:05.461
We're gonna promote freedom,

01:06:05.545 --> 01:06:08.213
usher in democratic
values and ideals,

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:10.716
and fight terror-loving
terrorists.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:16.805
But again, and not to
belabour the point,

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:18.599
one specific thing.

01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:29.985
Katie, I'd like to use
one of my lifelines.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:41.288
- I'm sorry?
- I want to phone a friend.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:45.584
Friday's debate should proceed.

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:47.503
We've been working
around the clock

01:06:47.587 --> 01:06:50.380
and presidents are going
to have to deal with

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:52.382
more than one thing at a time.

01:06:52.467 --> 01:06:54.760
New CNN/Time opinion
research polls

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:57.341
show Obama surging in key
battleground states...

01:06:57.342 --> 01:06:58.356
Son of a bitch.

01:06:58.357 --> 01:07:00.466
Like Pennsylvania where he
is now up by nine points.

01:07:00.486 --> 01:07:02.851
Governor, I just want you to know

01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:04.978
I got your Alaskan
poll numbers in,

01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:07.105
and you'll be pleased to know

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:09.942
- that you're in the low 70s.
- Fine.

01:07:18.326 --> 01:07:20.359
Why are they fucking me like this?

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.419
Who?

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:24.373
The press. They used to love me.

01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:27.793
Now all they want to do
in life is fuck me over.

01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:30.379
I can't believe Katie
did that to me.

01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:32.881
And did you hear what Olbermann
said about me last night?

01:07:32.966 --> 01:07:36.593
Sir, you've got to stop
watching Keith Olbermann,

01:07:36.678 --> 01:07:39.930
or Fox, for that matter.
It's all just bullshit.

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:44.351
Now, sir, you should have a beer

01:07:44.435 --> 01:07:46.562
and watch ESPN, okay?

01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:47.980
And while you're watching it,

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:50.315
think about what the
people who watch ESPN

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.359
really need in their
lives right now.

01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:54.027
I thought Katie liked me.

01:07:54.112 --> 01:07:57.406
She does. And the
questions were fair.

01:07:57.490 --> 01:08:01.243
It was Governor Palin who
gave a terrible interview.

01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:02.828
That poor girl.

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:06.290
She wasn't ready for this.

01:08:06.374 --> 01:08:09.668
Yeah, I'm afraid
you're right, sir.

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:14.172
And YouTube is making
it exponentially worse.

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:16.425
People are watching Katie
Couric and Tina Fey

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:17.926
over and over again.

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:20.679
It's playing like an
infinite loop on the Web.

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:24.349
No presidential campaign has ever
had to deal with this before.

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:28.270
But she's gonna do a good
job in the debate, right?

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:31.064
Yes, sir. She'll be great.

01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:33.649
Because if it goes like Couric,
I don't think we can recover.

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:37.112
I agree, and I promise
she'll be great.

01:08:37.196 --> 01:08:38.904
I hope you're right.

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:43.201
I hope you're right, Steve.

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:45.245
It's gonna be fine.

01:08:54.212 --> 01:08:57.633
Okay, this one came
up in the '96 debate.

01:08:57.716 --> 01:08:59.509
Is there a magic bullet

01:08:59.594 --> 01:09:01.595
to solve the problem
of public education?

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:04.723
If not, what is the best solution?

01:09:08.227 --> 01:09:10.395
Governor?

01:09:17.236 --> 01:09:19.779
Governor, would you
like something to eat?

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:26.536
Yeah, I think you should
eat something, Governor.

01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:28.330
How about a Diet Dr Pepper?

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:30.082
Would you like... could you?

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:35.127
Governor?

01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:40.133
I miss my baby. I miss
sleeping with my baby.

01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:45.305
She constantly slips into
these catatonic stupors.

01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:47.307
And then when we do
finally get her to work,

01:09:47.392 --> 01:09:49.352
she writes all the information
down on note cards,

01:09:49.372 --> 01:09:50.997
but she can't remember any of it.

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.648
Steve, did you do an
approval poll in Alaska?

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:56.983
- She keeps bringing it up.
- What the fuck?

01:09:57.068 --> 01:09:59.361
I did that stupid fucking
poll a week ago.

01:09:59.445 --> 01:10:01.154
I told her she's in the 70s.

01:10:01.239 --> 01:10:02.919
Yeah, well, I don't
think she believes you.

01:10:03.004 --> 01:10:04.504
She says you made
those numbers up.

01:10:04.588 --> 01:10:05.992
Okay.

01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:08.579
She is becoming
completely irrational.

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:09.580
Becoming?

01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:13.750
I don't even like to say this,

01:10:13.835 --> 01:10:15.377
but has it occurred to you guys

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:17.129
that she might be
mentally unstable?

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:24.010
Mark, look, the debate
is in five days.

01:10:24.095 --> 01:10:25.887
What do you think?

01:10:27.765 --> 01:10:31.852
I think this debate will
be a debacle of historic

01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:34.479
and epic proportions.

01:10:37.275 --> 01:10:39.484
Well, that's encouraging.

01:10:55.877 --> 01:10:58.211
What would you say
best qualifies you

01:10:58.296 --> 01:11:00.547
to be John McCain's running mate?

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:06.386
John McCain has that streak
of independence in him

01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:10.098
that I think is very, very
important in our leadership today.

01:11:10.183 --> 01:11:11.892
I have that within me also.

01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:14.269
And that's why John
McCain tapped me,

01:11:14.353 --> 01:11:16.229
to be a team of mavericks,

01:11:16.314 --> 01:11:19.524
of independence as a team member

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:22.360
on this... in this new team.

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:24.738
I'm gonna do that one over again.

01:11:24.822 --> 01:11:26.156
- Yeah, sure.
- John...

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.992
Governor, important to remember

01:11:29.076 --> 01:11:31.953
that you don't need to
say anything specific.

01:11:32.038 --> 01:11:34.790
Okay? If you don't know the
answer to the question,

01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:37.834
just bring it back to the general
theme of reforming America

01:11:37.919 --> 01:11:40.587
or pivot to one of your
stronger suits, like energy.

01:11:40.671 --> 01:11:43.590
Yeah, because that's where
I'm most comfortable.

01:11:43.674 --> 01:11:45.509
That's pretty clear.

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:47.636
Let's try another question.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.054
Global warming...

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:50.972
Governor Palin, do you believe

01:11:51.057 --> 01:11:52.724
that global warming is man-made?

01:11:55.937 --> 01:11:57.646
Ahem.

01:11:57.730 --> 01:12:00.232
I think all this talk
and jibber-jabber

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:03.652
about where global warming
comes from defeats...

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:06.738
defeats, you know, the point
that it's getting hotter

01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:10.784
and that we all need to be
very concerned about heat.

01:12:10.868 --> 01:12:12.994
And...

01:12:13.079 --> 01:12:14.538
that...

01:12:14.622 --> 01:12:16.623
I...

01:12:16.707 --> 01:12:18.041
forgot it and it's not in this...

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:21.503
Mark, all the cards are
supposed to be in this pile.

01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:23.380
- Okay.
- It's not in this pile.

01:12:23.464 --> 01:12:26.007
I think we need to take a break.

01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:27.926
Can you all leave us
alone for a minute?

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:41.690
The debate is in four days,

01:12:41.774 --> 01:12:44.150
and this isn't working, Governor.

01:12:44.235 --> 01:12:46.152
I know.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:53.952
I think you should get off
this no-carb diet immediately.

01:12:55.162 --> 01:12:57.497
This goofy diet is bad for you,

01:12:57.582 --> 01:12:59.499
and I'm alarmed by
your weight loss.

01:13:01.502 --> 01:13:05.422
Governor, the Katie Couric
interview didn't go well.

01:13:05.506 --> 01:13:09.259
And it wasn't Nicolle
Wallace's fault.

01:13:09.343 --> 01:13:11.052
It wasn't Katie Couric's fault.

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:13.221
It wasn't the liberal
media's fault.

01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:16.433
It was your fault, because
you didn't prepare.

01:13:16.517 --> 01:13:18.268
And there can never
be another instance

01:13:18.352 --> 01:13:22.105
of something not going well
because you didn't prepare.

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:35.827
Hey.

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:37.746
Hey, hey, hey.

01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:39.414
Look, you had a bad interview.

01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:43.043
It's okay, it happens.

01:13:43.127 --> 01:13:47.714
You know what Ronald Reagan
said caused pollution?

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:50.842
Trees.

01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:58.516
- Reagan said that?
- He did.

01:13:58.601 --> 01:14:01.019
He said trees cause pollution.

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:04.314
And he not only won the election,

01:14:04.398 --> 01:14:07.359
he went on to be a
great president.

01:14:10.613 --> 01:14:15.158
I just... I don't want
to let John down.

01:14:25.086 --> 01:14:26.670
Stevie boy.

01:14:26.754 --> 01:14:29.172
We have a problem, sir.

01:14:30.257 --> 01:14:32.425
What's going on?

01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:34.761
It's Palin.

01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:38.431
She could be on the verge of a
complete nervous breakdown.

01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:43.812
I don't know what to do.

01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:46.773
We threw her into the deep end
without a life preserver.

01:14:46.857 --> 01:14:48.942
Yeah, and we're
drowning with her, sir.

01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:53.530
We need to get her
back with her family.

01:14:53.614 --> 01:14:56.574
She needs to be surrounded by...

01:14:56.659 --> 01:14:59.077
by people who love her.

01:15:00.538 --> 01:15:03.415
Hey, let's get 'em
all out to Sedona,

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:05.250
out in the open air.

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:07.252
My neighbour's a doctor,

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:10.505
and Cindy can invite him over
for a barbecue or something,

01:15:10.589 --> 01:15:12.173
and he can observe her

01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:14.551
and see if it's truly serious.

01:15:14.635 --> 01:15:16.386
But let's just get 'em to Sedona.

01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:18.763
It'll do wonders for
her, I know it.

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:20.432
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:26.730
âª There'll be âª

01:15:26.814 --> 01:15:31.109
âª Greener pastures âª

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:39.617
âª Cross that borderline âª

01:15:42.288 --> 01:15:48.710
âª We'll see new horizons âª

01:15:48.794 --> 01:15:50.628
âª My darling âª

01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:56.551
âª Far beyond the great divide âª

01:15:56.635 --> 01:15:58.511
Oh, hey.

01:15:58.596 --> 01:16:00.805
I missed you guys so much.

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:03.850
- Hi. Mummy, Mummy.
- Oh, my goodness.

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:07.145
Got someone who wants to say hi.

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:08.980
Hi.

01:16:12.276 --> 01:16:14.652
- What's up, Doc?
- Hey, how you doing?

01:16:14.737 --> 01:16:18.198
That depends. How's she look?

01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:20.658
For a woman who's just had a baby,

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:23.745
has a pregnant teen
daughter and a son in Iraq,

01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:26.498
I'd say not half bad.

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:30.543
You, however, look like shit.

01:16:33.339 --> 01:16:35.090
They keep piling all
this stuff on me,

01:16:35.174 --> 01:16:37.342
and I just can't
remember everything.

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:40.011
- Are you getting some of it?
- Yeah.

01:16:40.096 --> 01:16:42.097
Some, but I have to talk

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:45.141
for like 90 minutes up there.

01:16:45.226 --> 01:16:47.352
Do you remember when
you debated Halcro?

01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:50.355
He had no notes, no papers,

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:53.858
and he could spout off all
these facts and figures?

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:56.194
You were so intimidated...

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:59.030
until you looked out
at the audience.

01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:00.907
What'd you realise?

01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:03.284
That none of what
he said mattered,

01:17:03.369 --> 01:17:05.537
because no one knew what
he was talking about.

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:08.706
It's the same thing here,
baby. It's just more people.

01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:11.417
You're getting yourself in trouble

01:17:11.502 --> 01:17:12.877
because they're trying to turn you

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:14.963
into something that you're not.

01:17:15.047 --> 01:17:17.674
You gotta do what you do.

01:17:17.758 --> 01:17:20.802
Just talk to people the
way you talk to them.

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:22.887
And they'll love you.

01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:26.141
They always have.

01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:29.394
I love you, first dude.

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:31.604
I love you, too...

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:34.691
Mrs Vice President.

01:18:08.267 --> 01:18:09.684
Steve, what's up?

01:18:09.768 --> 01:18:11.224
How many questions
does Sarah Palin

01:18:11.225 --> 01:18:12.437
have to answer in the debate?

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:15.565
22 to 25.

01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:17.567
And how long is each answer?

01:18:17.651 --> 01:18:19.402
Two minutes with pivots.

01:18:19.486 --> 01:18:21.362
So if all we have to do

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:24.157
is get the best actress
in American politics

01:18:24.241 --> 01:18:27.368
to memorise 45 minutes'
worth of answers,

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:29.495
then why did we waste five days

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:33.249
trying to get her to understand
what any of this shit means?

01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:38.755
Governor, I didn't know
you were going for a jog.

01:18:38.839 --> 01:18:40.108
I have a different strategy.

01:18:40.109 --> 01:18:41.716
I need to clear my head for a bit.

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:43.718
Well, we really need to prepare...

01:18:43.802 --> 01:18:45.887
I really need to
go running, Steve,

01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:47.597
because it's gonna
make me feel better.

01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:49.057
Can you understand that?

01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:50.975
Of course, Governor.

01:19:05.032 --> 01:19:08.326
I think we need to get
rid of these note cards.

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:11.704
- They're not helping.
- Okay.

01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:13.748
I hate those flipping
cards anyway.

01:19:13.832 --> 01:19:17.210
Now, what we need you to do

01:19:17.294 --> 01:19:21.256
is to memorise 25 answers
and four attack lines.

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:24.092
Do you think you can do that?

01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:25.593
Yeah, I can do that.

01:19:27.805 --> 01:19:29.931
And you're gonna be great.

01:19:48.367 --> 01:19:51.953
And we are to be that
shining city on a hill,

01:19:52.037 --> 01:19:55.081
as President Reagan
so beautifully said,

01:19:55.165 --> 01:19:57.583
and that we are a beacon of hope

01:19:57.668 --> 01:20:00.461
and that we are unapologetic here.

01:20:00.546 --> 01:20:01.963
Governor Palin,

01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:05.925
nuclear Iran is one of
our gravest threats.

01:20:06.010 --> 01:20:08.970
What would a McCain
administration do to stop it?

01:20:09.054 --> 01:20:11.180
On the subject of nuclear Iran,

01:20:11.265 --> 01:20:14.142
Senator O'Biden and I are
most likely in agreement.

01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:16.436
They cannot be allowed

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:20.148
to acquire nuclear
weapons, period.

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:22.317
Israel is in jeopardy, of course,

01:20:22.401 --> 01:20:23.985
when dealing with Ahmadinejad

01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:26.654
as a leader of Iran.

01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:29.657
It was Ronald Reagan
who said that freedom

01:20:29.742 --> 01:20:32.744
is always just one generation
away from extinction.

01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:35.997
We don't pass it to our
children in the bloodstream,

01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:38.875
we have to fight for
it and protect it,

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:40.501
and then hand it to them

01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:42.754
so that they shall do the same.

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:45.006
We will fight for it.

01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:47.216
And there is only one
man in this race

01:20:47.301 --> 01:20:51.179
who has really ever
fought for you,

01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:53.306
and that's Senator John McCain.

01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:55.475
Yeah.

01:20:55.559 --> 01:20:56.934
Yeah, she's back.

01:20:57.019 --> 01:21:00.813
Sarah Palin is back,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:21:00.898 --> 01:21:02.398
Whoo.

01:21:02.483 --> 01:21:04.484
- Great job, Governor.
- It was pretty good, huh?

01:21:04.568 --> 01:21:05.943
Pretty good? It was amazing.

01:21:06.028 --> 01:21:08.196
There's just one slight
adjustment I want to give you.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.031
You need to call
him Senator Biden,

01:21:10.115 --> 01:21:11.167
not Senator O'Biden.

01:21:11.168 --> 01:21:13.368
That's what I called
him, Senator O'Biden.

01:21:13.452 --> 01:21:14.952
- You just said it again.
- Said what?

01:21:15.037 --> 01:21:17.455
- O'Biden.
- Right. Senator Biden.

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:20.375
- That's it.
- Oh. Biden.

01:21:20.459 --> 01:21:21.588
No, no, there's no O.

01:21:21.589 --> 01:21:23.503
No, I meant Oh, as
in Oh, I get it,

01:21:23.587 --> 01:21:25.129
not O as in O'Biden.

01:21:25.214 --> 01:21:27.006
Oh.

01:21:27.091 --> 01:21:29.050
Okay, well, let's practise it.

01:21:29.134 --> 01:21:32.220
Governor, do you agree
with Senator Biden's

01:21:32.304 --> 01:21:34.055
position on the bailout?

01:21:34.139 --> 01:21:35.890
- Senator O'Biden...
- Biden.

01:21:35.974 --> 01:21:37.266
Doggone it.

01:21:51.407 --> 01:21:53.741
- This is Sarah.
- Hey, Mum.

01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:55.618
Hey, honey. How are ya?

01:21:55.702 --> 01:21:57.286
I'm good. I'm...

01:21:57.371 --> 01:21:59.872
- I'm good, Mum.
- Where are ya?

01:21:59.957 --> 01:22:02.208
I'm not really allowed to say.

01:22:02.292 --> 01:22:04.335
Okay, sweetie, but you're safe?

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.254
Yeah, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:07.964
I just wanted to wish
you a good debate.

01:22:08.048 --> 01:22:10.174
Thank you.

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:13.136
- Did you study?
- I did.

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:14.846
A lot.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:16.848
I'll be praying for you.

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:18.307
Please, I'll need it.

01:22:18.392 --> 01:22:20.184
Come on, Mum, you're
gonna do great.

01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:23.271
I love you.

01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:25.690
I love you so much, Track.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:29.360
- Fall in.
- I gotta go, Mum.

01:22:29.445 --> 01:22:31.612
No, no, no. Just...
Just another minute.

01:22:31.697 --> 01:22:33.417
No, I'm really sorry,
but I really gotta go.

01:22:33.437 --> 01:22:34.949
You're gonna do great
tonight, okay?

01:22:35.033 --> 01:22:37.785
Thank you, thank you, but,
sweetie-sweetie, you be safe.

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:40.538
I will.

01:22:40.622 --> 01:22:42.540
Bye.

01:22:49.256 --> 01:22:50.631
You okay?

01:22:52.009 --> 01:22:57.555
My son is safe.

01:23:09.067 --> 01:23:10.985
Well, what we are going to see

01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:13.821
is probably the most anticipated

01:23:13.906 --> 01:23:15.656
vice presidential debate

01:23:15.741 --> 01:23:18.618
that I have covered ever.

01:23:18.702 --> 01:23:20.828
A lot, a lot of pressure
on Sarah Palin.

01:23:20.913 --> 01:23:22.788
As for Joe Biden, it's sort of a,

01:23:22.873 --> 01:23:25.124
first of all, do-no-harm
night for him.

01:23:25.209 --> 01:23:28.336
No one has questioned
that he is qualified

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:29.795
to be vice president.

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:31.464
He needs to... both of them

01:23:31.548 --> 01:23:33.508
need to talk about the
top of their tickets.

01:23:33.592 --> 01:23:36.469
After all, this isn't a
race to be vice president

01:23:36.553 --> 01:23:39.180
so much as it is to be number two

01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:41.265
to the top people on the ticket.

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:43.935
On the Joe Biden
side, you will see

01:23:44.019 --> 01:23:46.854
an effort to say,
Look, Sarah Palin...

01:23:46.939 --> 01:23:49.774
Hurry.

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:51.692
Pray with me.

01:23:51.777 --> 01:23:53.569
What should we pray for?

01:23:53.654 --> 01:23:56.072
Just pray that we win the debate.

01:23:56.156 --> 01:23:58.699
Mum, that would be cheating.

01:24:03.622 --> 01:24:05.623
Okay.

01:24:10.963 --> 01:24:12.463
We want to welcome our viewers

01:24:12.548 --> 01:24:14.215
in the United States
and around the world.

01:24:14.299 --> 01:24:15.969
I'm Wolf Blitzer,
together with the

01:24:15.970 --> 01:24:17.593
best political team on television.

01:24:17.678 --> 01:24:20.721
We've been waiting for this
night for a long time...

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:27.562
I did this same walk for
Geraldine Ferraro in 1984.

01:24:27.646 --> 01:24:28.938
Holy geez, that's cool.

01:24:29.022 --> 01:24:30.731
This is your toe mark.

01:24:30.816 --> 01:24:32.275
Okay.

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:35.152
30 seconds.

01:24:35.237 --> 01:24:37.572
Two, pull back wide on
her entrance, please.

01:24:37.656 --> 01:24:40.992
Ready, two. And take two.

01:24:43.829 --> 01:24:45.746
Good evening from
Washington University

01:24:45.831 --> 01:24:47.331
in St. Louis, Missouri.

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:49.125
I'm Gwen Ifill of the NewsHour

01:24:49.209 --> 01:24:51.586
and Washington Week on PBS.

01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:54.589
Welcome to the first
and the only 2008

01:24:54.673 --> 01:24:55.965
vice presidential debate

01:24:56.049 --> 01:24:57.883
between the Republican nominee,

01:24:57.968 --> 01:24:59.885
Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska,

01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:03.431
and the Democratic nominee,
Joe Biden of Delaware.

01:25:03.515 --> 01:25:06.309
Tonight's discussion will
cover a wide range of topics,

01:25:06.393 --> 01:25:09.854
including domestic and
foreign policy matters.

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:11.856
Each candidate will
have 90 seconds

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:14.108
to respond to a direct question

01:25:14.192 --> 01:25:15.985
and then an additional two minutes

01:25:16.069 --> 01:25:17.903
for rebuttal and follow-up.

01:25:17.988 --> 01:25:20.990
The specific subjects and
questions were chosen by me

01:25:21.074 --> 01:25:23.451
and have not been
shared or cleared

01:25:23.535 --> 01:25:25.870
with anyone on the campaigns
or on the commission.

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:27.872
The audience here in the hall

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:30.666
has promised to
remain very polite...

01:25:30.751 --> 01:25:34.587
no cheers, applause, no
untoward outbursts...

01:25:34.671 --> 01:25:36.839
- Biden. Biden. Biden.
- Except right at this minute

01:25:36.923 --> 01:25:40.301
as we welcome Governor
Palin and Senator Biden.

01:25:48.268 --> 01:25:50.811
Nice to meet you. Hey,
can I call you Joe?

01:25:50.896 --> 01:25:52.021
You can call me Joe.

01:25:53.899 --> 01:25:56.609
- Why... Why is the mike on?
- No, no, no, it's cool.

01:25:56.693 --> 01:25:58.110
They're gonna think it's some kind

01:25:58.195 --> 01:26:00.696
of Machiavellian Jedi power play.

01:26:00.781 --> 01:26:03.157
From your lips, Steve.

01:26:03.241 --> 01:26:04.492
Welcome to you both.

01:26:04.576 --> 01:26:07.036
The House of Representatives
this week passed a bill,

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.412
a big bailout bill...

01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:10.039
Or didn't pass it, I should say.

01:26:10.123 --> 01:26:11.957
The Senate decided to pass it

01:26:12.042 --> 01:26:13.962
and the House is wrestling
with it still tonight.

01:26:13.982 --> 01:26:16.921
Was this the worst of Washington
or the best of Washington

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:18.673
that we saw play out?

01:26:18.757 --> 01:26:20.925
Thank you, Gwen, and I
thank the commission also.

01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:23.049
I appreciate this privilege
of being able to be here

01:26:23.095 --> 01:26:24.345
and speak with Americans.

01:26:24.429 --> 01:26:27.056
Please, God, be kind.

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:28.683
You know, I think a
good barometer here

01:26:28.767 --> 01:26:31.394
when we're trying to figure
out has this been a good time

01:26:31.478 --> 01:26:35.022
or a bad time in
America's economy is...

01:26:35.107 --> 01:26:37.108
go to a kids' soccer
game on Saturday

01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:40.236
and turn to any parent there
on the sideline and ask them,

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.029
How are you feeling
about the economy?

01:26:42.114 --> 01:26:43.698
And I'll betcha you're gonna hear

01:26:43.782 --> 01:26:46.075
some fear in that
parent's voice...

01:26:46.159 --> 01:26:48.536
She's doing great.

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:50.454
We've got 88 more minutes.

01:26:50.539 --> 01:26:53.541
Did we just take a major hit
with those investments?

01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:56.919
There is something to be said
also for man's activities,

01:26:57.003 --> 01:27:00.881
but also for the cyclical
temperature changes on our planet.

01:27:00.966 --> 01:27:03.718
Senator, what is true and what
is false about the causes?

01:27:03.802 --> 01:27:06.971
If you don't understand
what the cause is,

01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:09.432
it's virtually impossible
to come up with a solution.

01:27:09.516 --> 01:27:12.435
The chant is Drill, baby, drill.

01:27:12.519 --> 01:27:15.187
And that's what we hear
all across this country

01:27:15.272 --> 01:27:18.065
in our rallies, because
people are so hungry

01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:20.317
for those domestic
sources of energy

01:27:20.402 --> 01:27:22.403
to be tapped into.

01:27:22.487 --> 01:27:23.988
We will end this war.

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:25.489
For John McCain,

01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:28.659
there is no end in
sight to end this war.

01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:31.078
We will end this war.

01:27:31.163 --> 01:27:33.080
Governor...

01:27:33.165 --> 01:27:36.459
Your plan

01:27:36.543 --> 01:27:39.170
is a white flag of surrender

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:40.921
- in Iraq.
- Whoo. Yes.

01:27:42.382 --> 01:27:43.982
Governor, please, did
you want to respond

01:27:44.066 --> 01:27:45.906
to Senator McCain's
comments about health care?

01:27:45.926 --> 01:27:47.595
Pivot. Pivot.

01:27:47.679 --> 01:27:50.264
I'd like to respond about
the tax increases and...

01:27:50.348 --> 01:27:52.266
Yes.

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:54.727
Darn right, we need tax relief

01:27:54.811 --> 01:27:57.271
for Americans so that
jobs can be created here.

01:27:57.355 --> 01:27:59.315
Barack Obama and Senator O'Biden,

01:27:59.399 --> 01:28:01.108
you said no to everything...

01:28:01.193 --> 01:28:02.985
She just said O'Biden.

01:28:03.069 --> 01:28:04.749
We're probably the only
ones that heard it.

01:28:04.769 --> 01:28:06.739
It was Ronald Reagan who said

01:28:06.823 --> 01:28:09.450
that freedom is always
just one generation away

01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:11.118
from extinction.

01:28:11.203 --> 01:28:14.914
We don't pass it to our
children in the bloodstream.

01:28:14.998 --> 01:28:18.626
We have to fight for
it and protect it,

01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:20.252
and then hand it to them

01:28:20.337 --> 01:28:22.797
so that they will do the same.

01:28:22.881 --> 01:28:24.799
We will fight for it.

01:28:24.883 --> 01:28:27.343
And there is only one
man in this race

01:28:27.427 --> 01:28:29.678
who has really ever
fought for you,

01:28:29.763 --> 01:28:31.639
and that's Senator John McCain.

01:28:38.438 --> 01:28:39.980
Okay, here we go.

01:28:40.065 --> 01:28:42.274
CBS instant poll says undecideds

01:28:42.359 --> 01:28:46.320
give the debate to
Biden, 46%; Palin, 21.

01:28:46.404 --> 01:28:48.531
Fuck CBS and fuck
their instant poll.

01:28:48.615 --> 01:28:50.074
This is the greatest
debate victory

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:51.700
in the history of the republic.

01:28:51.785 --> 01:28:53.786
Okay.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.545
You see? You just had to be you.

01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:06.257
I'm gonna grab a beer.

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:08.843
- Want one?
- No.

01:29:08.927 --> 01:29:12.680
Senator McCain wanted
me to congratulate you

01:29:12.764 --> 01:29:14.431
on a fantastic debate.

01:29:14.516 --> 01:29:17.476
- You really did a great job.
- Thanks.

01:29:17.561 --> 01:29:21.188
Tell John I want to bring up
Bill Ayers and Reverend Wright.

01:29:21.273 --> 01:29:23.649
I think it's time to
go for the jugular.

01:29:23.733 --> 01:29:26.902
You'll have to discuss that
with your running mate.

01:29:26.987 --> 01:29:30.072
He made it very clear that he
doesn't want to touch Wright.

01:29:30.156 --> 01:29:32.616
I'll talk to him about it.

01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:34.451
We have to win this thing.

01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:36.787
I so don't want to
go back to Alaska.

01:29:43.336 --> 01:29:45.713
Stevie.

01:29:45.797 --> 01:29:48.507
You know, I think the worst
of this thing might be over.

01:29:48.592 --> 01:29:50.134
All she's got left are speeches.

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:52.553
There's no more debates,
no major interviews.

01:29:52.637 --> 01:29:55.139
Yeah. We're doing great.

01:29:58.059 --> 01:30:01.562
This was an unbelievable
win for Sarah Palin.

01:30:01.646 --> 01:30:05.774
In fact, I think that it
unveiled a level of skill

01:30:05.859 --> 01:30:08.569
in communication that I
really have not seen

01:30:08.653 --> 01:30:10.571
since Ronald Reagan.

01:30:10.655 --> 01:30:12.907
She is a superstar.

01:30:12.991 --> 01:30:14.491
Her ability to by...

01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:16.410
And she sure is a
breath of fresh air.

01:30:16.494 --> 01:30:17.912
I mean, I think people want

01:30:17.996 --> 01:30:19.496
someone from outside
of Washington.

01:30:19.581 --> 01:30:20.956
She sounded like the future.

01:30:21.041 --> 01:30:22.583
Oh, come on, honey.

01:30:22.667 --> 01:30:23.959
Why don't you get some sleep?

01:30:24.044 --> 01:30:25.961
One sec, okay?

01:30:26.046 --> 01:30:28.088
Turned around. I think
she has done it

01:30:28.173 --> 01:30:30.799
in the sense that of the
four debaters we've seen,

01:30:30.884 --> 01:30:34.178
she was the most interesting,
attractive of them all.

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:36.680
- She is personable...
- I can still win this thing.

01:30:36.765 --> 01:30:38.265
She's got a sense of humour.

01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:39.850
She looked straight
into the camera

01:30:39.935 --> 01:30:42.186
while Joe's talking to Gwen...

01:30:45.690 --> 01:30:48.609
This map is now lopsided
in favour of Barack Obama.

01:30:48.693 --> 01:30:50.235
John McCain pulling
out of Michigan.

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:52.613
The first domino in
an economic debate

01:30:52.697 --> 01:30:54.907
that if John McCain does
not turn around soon,

01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:56.450
many see more blue on this map

01:30:56.534 --> 01:30:58.285
and more trouble for John McCain.

01:30:58.370 --> 01:30:59.828
Yesterday it was announced
that the campaign

01:30:59.913 --> 01:31:01.789
is going to leave
Michigan to Obama to win.

01:31:01.873 --> 01:31:04.113
- What's going on there?
- I read that this morning also,

01:31:04.133 --> 01:31:05.334
and I fired off a quick e-mail

01:31:05.418 --> 01:31:07.461
and I said, Oh, come
on. Do we have to?

01:31:07.545 --> 01:31:09.004
Do we have to call it there?

01:31:09.089 --> 01:31:11.715
I want to go back to
Michigan, and I want to try.

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:13.801
What the fuck?

01:31:13.885 --> 01:31:15.636
McCain had hoped to
just score a pick-up.

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:17.972
We made the decision to pull
the ads out of Michigan

01:31:18.056 --> 01:31:19.473
because we can't win there.

01:31:19.557 --> 01:31:21.058
We need the money in Pennsylvania

01:31:21.142 --> 01:31:24.395
- and Ohio.
- You're making a big mistake.

01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:26.522
You know, I know I'm not
an expert like yourself,

01:31:26.606 --> 01:31:28.732
but seeing as we're
seven points out,

01:31:28.817 --> 01:31:31.068
I don't see why the vice
presidential campaign

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:32.653
can't make a quick stop there

01:31:32.737 --> 01:31:33.946
in the middle of the night.

01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:35.489
And who are you gonna meet with?

01:31:35.573 --> 01:31:36.907
Your press corps doesn't want

01:31:36.992 --> 01:31:39.201
to hear you speak at
3:00 in the morning.

01:31:39.285 --> 01:31:42.204
And there's no such thing as a
vice presidential campaign.

01:31:42.288 --> 01:31:43.998
This is John McCain's campaign,

01:31:44.082 --> 01:31:46.917
and this is the decision
that John McCain has made.

01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:49.837
You must stick to the
script, Governor.

01:31:49.921 --> 01:31:52.423
And what script is that, Steve?

01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:54.258
Because I haven't seen
anything resembling

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:58.512
a script this entire
flipping campaign.

01:31:58.596 --> 01:32:01.015
When you publicly
contradict John McCain,

01:32:01.099 --> 01:32:02.599
you hurt John McCain.

01:32:02.684 --> 01:32:05.853
I know what I know what I know.

01:32:09.858 --> 01:32:11.608
And there you have it.

01:32:13.486 --> 01:32:16.071
Afternoon, Governor.

01:32:16.156 --> 01:32:18.449
This is a pro-stem cell ad?

01:32:18.533 --> 01:32:20.701
Yes, Governor. That's
the senator's position.

01:32:20.785 --> 01:32:23.495
Yeah, it's not my position.
I'm not saying it.

01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:25.039
I thought that...

01:32:25.123 --> 01:32:27.374
You guys should have shown
me the script ahead of time.

01:32:27.459 --> 01:32:30.127
This is a waste of my time.

01:32:33.048 --> 01:32:34.798
Why wasn't I informed
that Jeb Bradley

01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:36.383
is appearing with me at the rally?

01:32:36.468 --> 01:32:38.268
I don't think we foresaw
that being a problem.

01:32:38.344 --> 01:32:40.804
I just googled him.
He's pro-choice.

01:32:40.889 --> 01:32:44.725
There's no way I'm going on-stage
with anyone who's pro-choice.

01:32:45.852 --> 01:32:48.312
Bradley's gone or
I'm gone, period.

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:49.772
Yes, Governor.

01:32:49.856 --> 01:32:53.567
The R.N.C. spent a
stunning $150,000

01:32:53.651 --> 01:32:56.653
on clothes for Governor
Sarah Palin and her family

01:32:56.738 --> 01:32:59.281
according to the Federal
Election Commission reports.

01:32:59.365 --> 01:33:01.366
The revelation that so much money

01:33:01.451 --> 01:33:03.327
was spent at fancy clothing stores

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:05.412
like Neiman Marcus and
Saks Fifth Avenue

01:33:05.497 --> 01:33:07.706
could be a huge blow to
the governor's image

01:33:07.791 --> 01:33:10.167
as an everyday, average American.

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:12.169
Several Republican donors

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:14.004
have publicly expressed outrage...

01:33:14.089 --> 01:33:16.673
- You watching this?
- Yeah, I'm watching.

01:33:16.758 --> 01:33:18.258
Un-fucking-believable.

01:33:18.343 --> 01:33:21.345
Why didn't you people tell me
these clothes cost this much?

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:23.180
It wasn't just your
clothes, Governor.

01:33:23.264 --> 01:33:25.766
It was also for the kids,
Todd and your parents.

01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:27.351
I want 'em gone.

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:29.728
Get 'em out of here.

01:33:29.813 --> 01:33:32.648
You know, I buy my clothes
at consignment shops.

01:33:32.732 --> 01:33:36.235
I never wanted this fancy
crap in the first place.

01:33:36.319 --> 01:33:37.945
Hey, thanks for coming out.

01:33:38.029 --> 01:33:39.738
Hey. Hi, nice to meet you.

01:33:39.823 --> 01:33:42.407
- How are you? Hey, hi.
- Governor Palin,

01:33:42.492 --> 01:33:44.076
what's your response
to the findings

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.720
of the Alaska state
legislature's report

01:33:45.804 --> 01:33:47.644
on your involvement in
the Troopergate scandal?

01:33:47.664 --> 01:33:49.665
I was thrilled to be
cleared of all wrongdoing.

01:33:49.749 --> 01:33:51.375
You know you're not
supposed to be here.

01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:53.919
Go back to the press
risers, please. Thank you.

01:33:54.003 --> 01:33:56.755
You can't say you were
cleared of all wrongdoing.

01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:59.091
- Why not?
- Because you weren't.

01:33:59.175 --> 01:34:02.136
The report stated that
you abused your power.

01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:04.680
That is the opposite of being
cleared of all wrongdoing.

01:34:04.764 --> 01:34:06.941
- Then why was I told otherwise?
- You weren't told otherwise.

01:34:06.942 --> 01:34:08.392
And why haven't you
released a statement

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:09.935
saying that Todd
was never a member

01:34:10.019 --> 01:34:11.339
of the Alaska Independence Party?

01:34:11.359 --> 01:34:14.398
Because that would be
untrue. He was a member.

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:16.358
He checked the wrong box.

01:34:16.442 --> 01:34:17.818
He registered by accident

01:34:17.902 --> 01:34:19.945
and rectified the
error immediately.

01:34:20.029 --> 01:34:21.780
He was a member for seven years.

01:34:21.865 --> 01:34:24.449
I'm sorry, Governor, but...

01:34:24.534 --> 01:34:26.414
there is only a few weeks
left in this campaign.

01:34:26.434 --> 01:34:28.579
You have got to stop
saying things to the press

01:34:28.663 --> 01:34:30.164
that are blatantly untrue.

01:34:30.248 --> 01:34:32.529
That is not the kind of campaign
that we are running here.

01:34:32.584 --> 01:34:35.794
Campaign... Is that what
you're calling this now?

01:34:35.879 --> 01:34:38.881
Governor, I admit that this
is a dysfunctional campaign,

01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:40.465
but that is what I inherited,

01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:42.843
and I am doing my level best
to help us win this election.

01:34:42.927 --> 01:34:44.928
And that's what I'm
trying to do, too,

01:34:45.013 --> 01:34:46.722
and all you're doing
is screwing me up.

01:34:46.806 --> 01:34:49.641
That's all you've done this
entire time is get in my way.

01:34:49.726 --> 01:34:51.685
Oh, oh.

01:34:51.769 --> 01:34:54.396
And I am raising millions of
dollars for this campaign.

01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.315
Hundreds of thousands
of people are coming

01:34:56.399 --> 01:34:58.609
to see me speak, not John
McCain, God bless him.

01:34:58.693 --> 01:35:00.110
They are coming to see me.

01:35:00.195 --> 01:35:04.364
So if I am single-handedly
carrying this campaign,

01:35:04.449 --> 01:35:06.450
I'm gonna do what I want.

01:35:19.297 --> 01:35:21.506
Sarah. Sarah. Sarah.

01:35:27.388 --> 01:35:31.016
Several McCain advisers
tell CNN they're annoyed

01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:34.102
by what one aide called
Palin going rogue.

01:35:34.187 --> 01:35:35.771
Goddamn it.

01:35:35.855 --> 01:35:37.981
I hate it when there's
leaking and backstabbing

01:35:38.066 --> 01:35:41.068
after a campaign, let alone
before it's fucking over.

01:35:41.152 --> 01:35:44.154
I need you to step
in and talk to her.

01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:47.324
I don't know, Stevie
boy. I don't know.

01:35:47.408 --> 01:35:50.369
Sir...

01:35:50.453 --> 01:35:52.371
I can't control her any more.

01:35:55.667 --> 01:35:57.834
I don't know if she's
getting on a campaign plane

01:35:57.919 --> 01:36:00.003
in the morning or what
she's gonna say at night.

01:36:00.088 --> 01:36:03.048
We need to finish this campaign

01:36:03.132 --> 01:36:05.175
with as much dignity as possible,

01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:06.677
and the only way that can happen

01:36:06.761 --> 01:36:08.428
is if you get her in line.

01:36:11.849 --> 01:36:13.892
That's not gonna do it, Steve.

01:36:13.977 --> 01:36:16.311
She might start turning on me.

01:36:28.366 --> 01:36:30.701
Most of these polls
have us trailing

01:36:30.785 --> 01:36:32.786
five to eight points.

01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:35.122
- So what now?
- John...

01:36:35.206 --> 01:36:37.124
I mean, these numbers do show it.

01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:39.793
We've got to make
this about Obama.

01:36:39.877 --> 01:36:41.336
We've got to get tough

01:36:41.421 --> 01:36:43.297
and we've got to get negative.

01:36:43.381 --> 01:36:45.215
If we go this way,

01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:49.052
Reverend Wright is still
the best play we have.

01:36:50.513 --> 01:36:53.307
Any of you ever been accused

01:36:53.391 --> 01:36:57.561
of having a Negro
child out of wedlock

01:36:57.645 --> 01:37:01.231
because your adopted daughter
was born in Bangladesh?

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:03.984
And then when she was 16

01:37:04.068 --> 01:37:07.446
and googled her name, I
had to explain to her

01:37:07.530 --> 01:37:11.074
why President Bush's henchmen
called her a bastard

01:37:11.159 --> 01:37:13.660
when she was 10 years old.

01:37:13.745 --> 01:37:16.913
Yeah, listen, South Carolina...
that was an ugly primary,

01:37:16.998 --> 01:37:18.582
but this isn't the same thing.

01:37:18.666 --> 01:37:21.001
I mean, Reverend Wright
really did say those things.

01:37:21.085 --> 01:37:23.462
That may be true.

01:37:23.546 --> 01:37:27.007
But there is a dark side
to American populism.

01:37:27.091 --> 01:37:30.302
Some people win elections
by tapping into it.

01:37:32.013 --> 01:37:34.931
I'm not one of those people.

01:37:35.016 --> 01:37:39.019
Okay. So what about Bill Ayers?

01:37:39.103 --> 01:37:41.271
Obama began his career

01:37:41.356 --> 01:37:43.357
in the living room of
a domestic terrorist.

01:37:43.441 --> 01:37:46.943
Domestic terrorist.
Nothing to do with race.

01:37:52.533 --> 01:37:54.701
Yeah, okay.

01:37:54.786 --> 01:37:57.329
Ayers is fair.

01:37:57.413 --> 01:37:59.706
Okay. Who should do this?

01:37:59.791 --> 01:38:02.376
And Barack held one
of the first meetings

01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:06.380
of his political career in
Bill Ayers's living room.

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:11.802
Palling around with terrorists.

01:38:13.388 --> 01:38:15.055
He's not a Christian.

01:38:15.139 --> 01:38:17.808
And I am just so fearful

01:38:17.892 --> 01:38:20.227
that this is not a man

01:38:20.311 --> 01:38:22.729
who sees America

01:38:22.814 --> 01:38:25.927
the way that you and
I see America...

01:38:25.928 --> 01:38:27.484
He's a socialist.

01:38:27.568 --> 01:38:33.323
As the greatest source
for good in this world.

01:38:36.244 --> 01:38:38.537
U.S.A. U.S.A.

01:38:38.621 --> 01:38:41.415
U.S.A. U.S.A. U.S.A.

01:38:41.499 --> 01:38:44.251
What does Barack Obama
plan for America?

01:38:44.335 --> 01:38:46.503
Nothing.

01:38:46.587 --> 01:38:50.048
In short, who is the
real Barack Obama?

01:38:50.133 --> 01:38:53.093
A terrorist.

01:38:53.177 --> 01:38:55.011
We believe that the
best of America

01:38:55.096 --> 01:38:58.348
is not all in Washington,
DC We believe...

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:05.856
We believe that the
best of America

01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:08.859
is in these small towns
that we get to visit

01:39:08.943 --> 01:39:11.278
and in these wonderful
little pockets

01:39:11.362 --> 01:39:13.530
of what I call the real America.

01:39:13.614 --> 01:39:16.074
- Yes.
- Yeah.

01:39:17.285 --> 01:39:20.537
Sarah. Sarah.

01:39:26.043 --> 01:39:28.295
For a man who's
written two memoirs,

01:39:28.379 --> 01:39:29.921
he's no open book.

01:39:30.006 --> 01:39:32.299
You got that right.

01:39:32.383 --> 01:39:34.801
What does Barack Obama
see for America?

01:39:34.886 --> 01:39:36.303
He's a Muslim.

01:39:36.387 --> 01:39:37.971
He's a socialist.

01:39:38.055 --> 01:39:40.390
- He doesn't represent us.
- He doesn't belong here.

01:39:40.475 --> 01:39:42.809
He hangs out with people
who hate our country.

01:39:42.894 --> 01:39:45.604
- He's not American.
- Kill him.

01:39:45.688 --> 01:39:49.274
Send him back to Africa.

01:39:49.358 --> 01:39:50.984
Let me read to you, Tara,

01:39:51.068 --> 01:39:54.112
what Congressman John Lewis,
the civil rights icon,

01:39:54.197 --> 01:39:56.615
said on Saturday in a statement.

01:39:56.699 --> 01:39:59.159
He said, As one who was
a victim of violence

01:39:59.243 --> 01:40:01.443
and hate during the height of
the civil rights movement,

01:40:01.496 --> 01:40:03.497
I am deeply disturbed
by the negative tone

01:40:03.581 --> 01:40:05.624
of the McCain-Palin campaign.

01:40:05.708 --> 01:40:07.375
Senator McCain and
Governor Palin...

01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:09.127
We gotta tone the rhetoric down.

01:40:09.212 --> 01:40:11.296
It's gotten out of control.

01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:14.841
We can't even mention
Obama's name any more.

01:40:14.926 --> 01:40:16.843
The crowd gets too hot.

01:40:19.931 --> 01:40:22.933
This isn't the campaign
I wanted to run.

01:40:24.268 --> 01:40:26.228
I can't trust Obama.

01:40:26.312 --> 01:40:28.939
I've read about him,
and he's not a...

01:40:29.023 --> 01:40:31.191
He's a... He's a Arab.

01:40:31.275 --> 01:40:33.026
He's not an Amer...

01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:36.905
No, ma'am.

01:40:36.989 --> 01:40:40.033
He's a decent family-man citizen

01:40:40.117 --> 01:40:42.035
who I just happen to
have disagreements with

01:40:42.119 --> 01:40:44.371
on certain fundamental issues.

01:40:44.455 --> 01:40:47.707
And that's what this
campaign is all about.

01:40:47.792 --> 01:40:50.335
He's not. Thank you.

01:40:51.754 --> 01:40:53.547
Cutting through the bull tonight,

01:40:53.631 --> 01:40:55.131
on the eve of the election,

01:40:55.216 --> 01:40:57.551
the campaigns are relying
on their lucky charms.

01:40:57.635 --> 01:41:00.887
- Vodka rocks, lime.
- You got it.

01:41:00.972 --> 01:41:02.722
How's he doing?

01:41:02.807 --> 01:41:06.226
He's the most depressed I've
seen him the entire campaign.

01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:08.812
I can't get him to
stop watching MSNBC,

01:41:08.896 --> 01:41:11.147
which only makes him
more miserable.

01:41:13.067 --> 01:41:17.404
I'm amazed that someone who has
been in politics this long...

01:41:17.488 --> 01:41:20.865
takes all the petty
stuff so personally.

01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:23.743
And that's why they
are who they are.

01:41:23.828 --> 01:41:25.579
Reagan, Bush, Clinton...

01:41:25.663 --> 01:41:27.872
All they want is to be loved.

01:41:27.957 --> 01:41:30.417
The ones that don't
pathologically need to be loved,

01:41:30.501 --> 01:41:32.085
they don't get the nomination.

01:41:32.169 --> 01:41:34.045
They don't get to be president.

01:41:34.130 --> 01:41:35.589
If you'd understood that fact,

01:41:35.673 --> 01:41:38.313
you might have been able to better
handle our Alaskan moose hunter.

01:41:39.969 --> 01:41:42.262
God, it was a tough campaign.

01:41:42.346 --> 01:41:45.640
It wasn't a campaign, it
was a bad reality show.

01:41:45.725 --> 01:41:47.767
She didn't cost us the election.

01:41:47.852 --> 01:41:50.770
That was Bush. That
was the economy.

01:41:50.855 --> 01:41:53.023
That was just the
cold hand of fate.

01:41:53.107 --> 01:41:55.066
We didn't have a chance.

01:41:55.151 --> 01:41:56.776
And if we did win,

01:41:56.861 --> 01:42:00.655
would you feel comfortable
with President Palin?

01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:02.407
Why not? Then we would have won.

01:42:03.826 --> 01:42:05.410
Come on, guys, listen.

01:42:05.494 --> 01:42:08.413
I, too, wish that
the American people

01:42:08.497 --> 01:42:10.582
would choose the
future Abraham Lincoln

01:42:10.666 --> 01:42:12.834
or Thomas Jefferson,
but unfortunately,

01:42:12.918 --> 01:42:14.836
that's not the way
it works any more.

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:17.839
Now it takes movie star charisma

01:42:17.923 --> 01:42:20.133
to get elected president.

01:42:20.217 --> 01:42:23.887
And Obama and Palin, that's
what they are... they're stars.

01:42:23.971 --> 01:42:25.764
Primary difference being

01:42:25.848 --> 01:42:28.475
Sarah Palin can't name a
Supreme Court decision,

01:42:28.559 --> 01:42:30.810
whereas Barack Obama

01:42:30.895 --> 01:42:33.104
was a constitutional
law professor.

01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:34.606
Fuck you.

01:42:39.737 --> 01:42:41.363
You know what Dick Cheney said

01:42:41.447 --> 01:42:43.657
- when he found out we picked her?
- What?

01:42:43.741 --> 01:42:47.118
He said we made a reckless choice.

01:42:47.203 --> 01:42:51.456
When you lose the moral
high ground to Dick Cheney,

01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:54.125
it's time to rethink
your entire life.

01:42:54.210 --> 01:42:56.127
Enough Cheney cracks, okay?

01:42:56.212 --> 01:42:58.546
I mean, he's very misunderstood.

01:42:58.631 --> 01:42:59.991
How does he eat when he's wearing.

01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:01.841
Darth Vader's helmet, anyway?

01:43:03.427 --> 01:43:04.886
There we go.

01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:07.389
Gentlemen, let's wish
each other good luck.

01:43:07.473 --> 01:43:09.474
Who knows, we could have another

01:43:09.558 --> 01:43:11.476
Dewey-Truman situation here.

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.144
Always room for an upset.

01:43:13.229 --> 01:43:15.939
Yeah, maybe I'll wake up
with a full head of hair.

01:43:19.777 --> 01:43:22.445
You know, if we had just
asked her policy questions

01:43:22.530 --> 01:43:25.365
in the briefing, then
we would have known.

01:43:25.449 --> 01:43:27.867
I thought Culvahouse was gonna
grill her during the vet.

01:43:27.952 --> 01:43:30.328
Culvahouse thought we
were gonna grill her.

01:43:31.914 --> 01:43:34.124
It haunts me.

01:43:38.003 --> 01:43:40.505
After a hard-fought battle,

01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:43.425
the nation's longest-running
presidential race

01:43:43.509 --> 01:43:46.094
comes down to this
day... election day.

01:43:46.178 --> 01:43:49.723
Voting is now under way in
all the lower 48 states

01:43:49.807 --> 01:43:52.225
as we approach the end of
this historic election.

01:43:52.309 --> 01:43:54.436
People lined up across the country

01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:56.438
by the millions today.

01:43:56.522 --> 01:43:58.732
Turnout looks to be the
highest in decades.

01:43:58.816 --> 01:44:02.527
John McCain will carry Kentucky
once again, as expected.

01:44:02.611 --> 01:44:05.905
Eight electoral votes,
not a huge surprise.

01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:08.450
We are not able to
make a projection

01:44:08.534 --> 01:44:10.577
in the four other states...

01:44:10.661 --> 01:44:12.620
that are closing all their polls

01:44:12.705 --> 01:44:14.497
at this hour right now.

01:44:14.582 --> 01:44:16.624
And some of them are
battleground states...

01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:20.170
Georgia, Indiana, South
Carolina and Virginia.

01:44:20.254 --> 01:44:23.173
It doesn't necessarily mean that
it's gonna be close or not...

01:44:23.257 --> 01:44:26.176
Where's Virginia?

01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:28.803
Negative five. And Ohio's gone.

01:44:28.888 --> 01:44:32.140
- Got it.
- I'll keep you posted.

01:44:32.224 --> 01:44:33.933
Call you in 10.

01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:36.770
What's going on?

01:44:36.854 --> 01:44:39.063
We're gonna lose Pennsylvania.

01:44:39.148 --> 01:44:41.107
And Ohio.

01:44:43.194 --> 01:44:44.861
Steve...

01:44:44.945 --> 01:44:48.948
There's something I
have to tell you.

01:44:49.033 --> 01:44:51.618
What's wrong?

01:44:51.702 --> 01:44:53.870
I didn't vote.

01:44:53.954 --> 01:44:56.331
I couldn't do it.

01:44:56.415 --> 01:44:59.000
I didn't vote.

01:45:02.087 --> 01:45:03.630
I couldn't do it.

01:45:03.714 --> 01:45:05.632
It's okay.

01:45:05.716 --> 01:45:07.175
- Soledad.
- Alright, Wolf,

01:45:07.259 --> 01:45:09.019
we'll take you right to
the voter analysis...

01:45:10.721 --> 01:45:13.223
How we doing, Stevie boy?

01:45:16.685 --> 01:45:19.604
We lost Pennsylvania
and Ohio, sir.

01:45:37.998 --> 01:45:40.917
When my grandfather

01:45:41.001 --> 01:45:46.047
found out that the
Japanese had surrendered,

01:45:46.131 --> 01:45:47.841
he was lost.

01:45:47.925 --> 01:45:50.677
He didn't know what
to do with himself.

01:45:50.761 --> 01:45:53.638
He came home,

01:45:53.722 --> 01:45:56.391
dropped dead the very next day.

01:45:58.978 --> 01:46:02.730
Fought his war, then he died.

01:46:04.275 --> 01:46:05.900
And my dad,

01:46:05.985 --> 01:46:09.529
when he retired from the navy,

01:46:09.613 --> 01:46:12.031
he fell into a sense of despair

01:46:12.116 --> 01:46:14.367
for the rest of his life.

01:46:21.375 --> 01:46:23.877
I'm never gonna quit, Steve.

01:46:25.379 --> 01:46:26.880
I can't.

01:46:30.634 --> 01:46:32.302
I don't know how
to just fade away.

01:46:35.639 --> 01:46:37.891
Senator, I...

01:46:37.975 --> 01:46:39.976
I just want to say...

01:46:46.483 --> 01:46:48.151
What?

01:46:50.779 --> 01:46:53.197
I'm s... I'm s...

01:46:53.282 --> 01:46:55.325
I'm so sorry that I...

01:46:56.577 --> 01:46:58.995
suggested her.

01:47:01.248 --> 01:47:02.790
Don't be.

01:47:04.668 --> 01:47:06.252
Fuck 'em.

01:47:08.130 --> 01:47:11.049
What were we supposed to do?

01:47:11.133 --> 01:47:13.760
A truly historic night
here in the United States.

01:47:13.844 --> 01:47:15.345
Barack Obama will become

01:47:15.429 --> 01:47:17.472
the 44th president of
the United States.

01:47:17.556 --> 01:47:19.474
Sorry, Mum.

01:47:19.558 --> 01:47:21.225
Oh, thanks, kiddo.

01:47:21.310 --> 01:47:23.728
I'm really sorry, Mum.

01:47:23.812 --> 01:47:25.855
Sweetheart.

01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:28.232
You did great. You
know that, right?

01:47:28.317 --> 01:47:29.692
- Yeah.
- Okay?

01:47:29.777 --> 01:47:31.653
Come here, baby.

01:47:31.737 --> 01:47:34.082
It's all right. We're okay. Yeah.

01:47:34.083 --> 01:47:35.083
Yeah.

01:47:37.284 --> 01:47:40.495
I'll take the stress
very literally here.

01:47:40.579 --> 01:47:42.538
Just one quick... you think?

01:47:42.623 --> 01:47:45.458
And on this next part, would
you make sure you bold that?

01:47:45.542 --> 01:47:48.586
Oh, Chris, I need you to load
this in the Teleprompter for me.

01:47:48.671 --> 01:47:50.631
Steve Schmidt told me you
weren't making a speech.

01:47:50.651 --> 01:47:53.800
No. I am making a speech.

01:47:53.884 --> 01:47:55.760
Scully cleared it with Rick Davis.

01:47:55.844 --> 01:47:57.553
So just go ahead
and load it, okay?

01:47:57.638 --> 01:47:59.430
Okay.

01:48:02.559 --> 01:48:06.813
Okay, so, on the stress on
this one, I'll take it.

01:48:06.897 --> 01:48:09.023
- Jesus.
- Hey, sorry.

01:48:09.108 --> 01:48:11.109
Steve, I'm getting a bunch
of mixed messages here.

01:48:11.193 --> 01:48:13.233
Is the governor giving a
concession speech or not...

01:48:13.278 --> 01:48:15.738
I've already said this
five times already.

01:48:15.823 --> 01:48:17.532
She is not giving a speech.

01:48:17.616 --> 01:48:19.200
Well, she seems to
think otherwise.

01:48:19.284 --> 01:48:21.244
Well, she's not.

01:48:21.328 --> 01:48:22.954
What do you want me to tell her?

01:48:23.038 --> 01:48:25.707
Tell her she's not
fucking speaking.

01:48:25.791 --> 01:48:27.500
Okay, well, you both
seem pretty certain...

01:48:27.584 --> 01:48:30.128
Well, let my certainty
supersede her certainty.

01:48:30.212 --> 01:48:31.546
Goddamn it.

01:48:36.176 --> 01:48:37.593
Steve.

01:48:37.678 --> 01:48:39.679
You want to see me?

01:48:39.763 --> 01:48:41.305
Yes. This way.

01:48:49.481 --> 01:48:51.482
Excuse us a moment.

01:48:59.033 --> 01:49:02.035
I understand you've prepared
a speech. Is that correct?

01:49:02.119 --> 01:49:04.037
Yes, I have. I want to salute John

01:49:04.121 --> 01:49:06.330
for everything he's
done for this country.

01:49:06.415 --> 01:49:10.084
It's not going to happen.
You're not giving a speech.

01:49:10.169 --> 01:49:11.878
And why is that, Steve?

01:49:11.962 --> 01:49:13.504
You're not giving a speech

01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:15.465
because the vice
presidential candidate

01:49:15.549 --> 01:49:19.177
has never given a concession
speech on election night.

01:49:19.261 --> 01:49:21.304
It's not about you.

01:49:21.388 --> 01:49:23.556
It's about the country.

01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:26.517
Yeah, well, there's a lot of
things never been done before.

01:49:28.771 --> 01:49:30.313
Governor...

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:31.981
this country has just elected

01:49:32.066 --> 01:49:34.525
the first African-American
president

01:49:34.610 --> 01:49:37.028
in the history of its existence.

01:49:37.112 --> 01:49:38.571
And it is the concession speech

01:49:38.655 --> 01:49:40.156
that will legitimise
his succession

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:42.241
as commander in chief.

01:49:42.326 --> 01:49:44.577
It is a serious and
solemn occasion,

01:49:44.661 --> 01:49:47.246
and John McCain, and
only John McCain,

01:49:47.331 --> 01:49:49.749
will be giving this sacred speech.

01:49:49.833 --> 01:49:51.751
This is how it has been done

01:49:51.835 --> 01:49:53.753
in every presidential election

01:49:53.837 --> 01:49:56.005
since the dawn of the republic,

01:49:56.090 --> 01:49:57.673
and you, Sarah Palin,

01:49:57.758 --> 01:49:59.592
will not change the importance

01:49:59.676 --> 01:50:03.471
of this proud American tradition.

01:50:15.234 --> 01:50:18.778
We fought... We fought
as hard as we could.

01:50:18.862 --> 01:50:20.488
And though we feel short,

01:50:20.572 --> 01:50:22.698
the fail... the failure is mine.

01:50:22.783 --> 01:50:24.992
Oh, geez, no...

01:50:25.077 --> 01:50:26.619
I don't feel that short, Mark.

01:50:26.703 --> 01:50:28.913
Fell short, boss.

01:50:28.997 --> 01:50:31.332
- Yeah, thanks.
- Fell short. It's a typo.

01:50:31.416 --> 01:50:35.128
- John.
- Hi, Sarah.

01:50:36.713 --> 01:50:39.966
Well, we fought the good fight.

01:50:40.050 --> 01:50:42.677
We did.

01:50:42.761 --> 01:50:46.055
Now I'm just gonna get out
there and thank America.

01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:48.599
I can't wait to get out
there and thank you.

01:50:48.684 --> 01:50:52.478
I have a speech written that
is a real tribute to ya.

01:50:52.563 --> 01:50:56.524
No, I think these guys
have that covered.

01:50:56.608 --> 01:50:57.641
Right, Steve?

01:50:57.642 --> 01:50:59.235
Yes, sir. We have it covered.

01:50:59.319 --> 01:51:02.280
I just want the people to know
what a great man you are.

01:51:02.364 --> 01:51:04.031
I appreciate that,

01:51:04.116 --> 01:51:06.450
but these guys got
it all worked out.

01:51:06.535 --> 01:51:10.329
Yeah, you know, we probably
should get going now, sir, so...

01:51:10.414 --> 01:51:11.873
All right. Good.

01:51:14.543 --> 01:51:17.587
- Okay. We'll see you afterwards.
- I'll see you out there.

01:51:29.516 --> 01:51:33.102
You're one of the leaders
of the party now, Sarah.

01:51:33.187 --> 01:51:37.481
Don't get co-opted by Limbaugh
and the other extremists.

01:51:37.566 --> 01:51:40.067
They'll destroy the
party if you let them.

01:51:41.278 --> 01:51:43.863
Remember, you're a hockey mum.

01:51:43.947 --> 01:51:45.948
You just wanted to
make a difference,

01:51:46.033 --> 01:51:47.867
and you did.

01:51:47.951 --> 01:51:49.452
A big, huge difference.

01:51:49.536 --> 01:51:51.871
I'll always be
grateful. Thank you.

01:51:51.955 --> 01:51:53.873
- We should go, sir.
- Thank you, John.

01:52:06.053 --> 01:52:08.554
My friends, we have...

01:52:08.639 --> 01:52:11.766
we have come to the end
of a long journey.

01:52:13.477 --> 01:52:16.187
The American people have spoken,

01:52:16.271 --> 01:52:18.648
and they have spoken clearly.

01:52:18.732 --> 01:52:20.483
A little while ago,
I had the honour

01:52:20.567 --> 01:52:22.735
of calling Senator Barack Obama...

01:52:22.819 --> 01:52:24.695
to congrat...

01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:26.906
Please.

01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:28.866
To congratulate him
on being elected

01:52:28.951 --> 01:52:31.244
the next president of the
country we both love.

01:52:35.791 --> 01:52:38.751
Whatever our differences,

01:52:38.835 --> 01:52:41.003
we are fellow Americans.

01:52:41.088 --> 01:52:44.131
Yes, sir.

01:52:44.216 --> 01:52:47.093
I am so deeply
grateful to all of you

01:52:47.177 --> 01:52:48.928
for the great honour
of your support

01:52:49.012 --> 01:52:50.680
and all you have done for me.

01:52:52.849 --> 01:52:55.059
I am also, of course,

01:52:55.143 --> 01:52:57.853
very thankful to
Governor Sarah Palin,

01:52:57.938 --> 01:53:00.606
one of the best campaigners
I have ever seen.

01:53:04.695 --> 01:53:07.280
Still think she's fit for office?

01:53:07.364 --> 01:53:08.739
Who cares?

01:53:08.824 --> 01:53:10.992
In 48 hours, no one will
even remember who she is.

01:53:11.076 --> 01:53:13.577
We can all look forward
with great interest

01:53:13.662 --> 01:53:15.246
to her future service to Alaska,

01:53:15.330 --> 01:53:18.291
the Republican party
and our country.

01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:30.845
Sarah. Sarah. Sarah.

01:53:46.528 --> 01:53:49.947
There were numerous instances
of her saying things

01:53:50.032 --> 01:53:51.824
that were not accurate

01:53:51.908 --> 01:53:53.409
that opened the door to criticism

01:53:53.493 --> 01:53:56.662
that she was being
untruthful and inaccurate.

01:53:56.747 --> 01:54:00.583
And I think that is something
that continues to this day.

01:54:00.667 --> 01:54:02.335
And you think that's
fair criticism?

01:54:02.419 --> 01:54:04.128
I think that's fair criticism.

01:54:04.212 --> 01:54:07.340
Early on, though, you apparently
said she doesn't know anything.

01:54:07.424 --> 01:54:10.092
In the immediate aftermath
of her selection,

01:54:10.177 --> 01:54:14.013
it was clear to us that we...

01:54:14.097 --> 01:54:16.015
had a lot of work to do.

01:54:16.099 --> 01:54:18.893
For you, picking Sarah Palin
was about winning an election,

01:54:18.977 --> 01:54:22.355
not necessarily about who's gonna
be best as vice president.

01:54:22.439 --> 01:54:26.150
My job is to give
political advice.

01:54:26.234 --> 01:54:28.361
We needed to do something bold

01:54:28.445 --> 01:54:30.529
to try to win the race.

01:54:30.614 --> 01:54:32.740
If you had it to do over again,

01:54:32.824 --> 01:54:34.617
would you have her on the ticket?

01:54:39.122 --> 01:54:42.792
You don't get to go
back in time, Anderson,

01:54:42.876 --> 01:54:46.796
and... and have do-overs in life.

01:54:49.383 --> 01:54:53.177
âª God bless America âª

01:54:53.261 --> 01:54:55.346
âª Again âª

01:54:57.474 --> 01:55:03.229
âª You see all the
trouble that she's in âª

01:55:05.524 --> 01:55:09.568
âª Wash her pretty face âª

01:55:09.653 --> 01:55:13.739
âª Dry her eyes and then âª

01:55:13.824 --> 01:55:16.824
âª God bless America again âª

01:55:30.298 --> 01:55:36.053
âª You see all the
trouble that she's in âª

01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:42.393
âª Wash her pretty face âª

01:55:42.477 --> 01:55:46.647
âª Dry her eyes and then âª

01:55:46.731 --> 01:55:52.945
âª God bless America again âª

01:55:54.906 --> 01:55:58.784
âª Wash her pretty face âª

01:55:58.869 --> 01:56:03.122
âª Dry her eyes and then âª

01:56:03.206 --> 01:56:09.378
âª God bless America again âª
