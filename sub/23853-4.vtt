WEBVTT

00:01.476 --> 00:03.111
- Am I in trouble?
- Yes.

00:03.146 --> 00:05.012
Every now and then,
you got to break the rules.

00:05.048 --> 00:07.047
You see something you want,
and you take it.

00:07.082 --> 00:09.250
Oh, my God, he's talking to you.

00:09.285 --> 00:10.417
Oh, my God!

00:10.453 --> 00:12.353
Stop! I just told you to kiss the guy.

00:12.388 --> 00:14.655
You gave the Suitress to Madison?

00:14.690 --> 00:17.023
You wanted no part of
the "toxic sludge."

00:17.059 --> 00:19.426
And I didn't want to get in the
way of your "Essential Honesty."

00:19.462 --> 00:21.962
If you want to get to know me
and ask me out on a real date,

00:21.997 --> 00:23.263
maybe I'll say yes.

00:23.298 --> 00:24.831
- I love it.
- Who is this guy?

00:24.867 --> 00:26.633
His name's Xavier. He's a friend.

00:26.668 --> 00:28.168
He's lucky guy.

00:28.203 --> 00:31.404
Imagine a show
about underground dance scenes

00:31.439 --> 00:33.640
all over the world.
And Alexi's gonna host it.

00:33.675 --> 00:35.475
All right, let's make it happen.

00:35.510 --> 00:39.178
There is one person with whom
I've made a real connection...

00:39.213 --> 00:41.080
August.

00:41.115 --> 00:42.749
See? Her?

00:42.784 --> 00:43.883
Just cut her out.

00:43.918 --> 00:45.084
That's amazing.

00:45.119 --> 00:46.519
Listen, I got some footage.

00:46.554 --> 00:49.289
I think there's a real
zeitgeisty story here.

00:49.324 --> 00:51.324
Two people died last season.

00:51.359 --> 00:52.659
That's on me.

00:52.694 --> 00:55.094
Coming to me was a very important step.

00:55.129 --> 00:57.096
I want to help you figure out
where this...

00:57.131 --> 01:00.166
this darkness comes from.

01:00.201 --> 01:03.335
I need it tighter up here
as well, not just down there.

01:03.370 --> 01:05.171
Hey, Quinn...

01:05.206 --> 01:08.974
Oh, damn! A custom suit?

01:09.010 --> 01:11.810
Don't you think we ought to
actually sell our pitch first?

01:11.845 --> 01:14.680
Oh, Jay, I think you left
your balls in the hall.

01:14.715 --> 01:16.848
That's really cute.
And it's possibly illegal.

01:16.883 --> 01:18.450
Hey, go take a look at that.

01:18.485 --> 01:20.852
Berto, why are your hands not moving?

01:20.887 --> 01:21.953
You're here to work.

01:21.988 --> 01:23.888
Oh, my God.

01:23.924 --> 01:26.090
Quinn, where did you get
this shot of Alexi?

01:26.126 --> 01:28.359
Oh, I got it from his PR people.

01:28.394 --> 01:30.795
Makes you want to
lick the poster, right?

01:30.831 --> 01:32.663
I mean, yeah, Alexi's great,

01:32.699 --> 01:34.632
but Sissy Bounce came from Xavier.

01:34.667 --> 01:36.201
I wouldn't even know what it is
without him.

01:36.236 --> 01:37.401
Who the hell's Xavier?

01:37.437 --> 01:39.270
He's my boyfriend.

01:39.306 --> 01:41.806
I... I-I mean, I always just imagined

01:41.842 --> 01:42.907
he'd be a big part of the show.

01:42.943 --> 01:44.309
Yeah, that's a sticky one.

01:44.344 --> 01:45.810
I mean, for you.

01:45.845 --> 01:47.778
I mean, come on,
without Alexi's star power,

01:47.814 --> 01:49.313
all we have is your niche

01:49.349 --> 01:51.415
dance-around-the-world snooze-fest.

01:51.451 --> 01:53.183
You know, we'd have a better
chance of selling

01:53.219 --> 01:54.552
"Passport to Anal Bleaching."

01:54.587 --> 01:55.886
Hey, hey, hey.

01:55.921 --> 01:57.321
Do not laugh when you have

01:57.357 --> 01:59.256
sharp pins around my vagina, all right?

01:59.291 --> 02:00.725
Here, hold this.

02:00.760 --> 02:02.459
Look, I need you to
get the footage today

02:02.494 --> 02:05.229
of Alexi being sexy and romantic
with Serena

02:05.264 --> 02:07.231
so we can drop it into
a sizzle reel for Gary,

02:07.266 --> 02:09.066
which will make our pitch undeniable.

02:09.101 --> 02:10.834
Okay. I got it.

02:10.870 --> 02:12.569
We have a problem.

02:12.604 --> 02:15.205
- Well, August has a problem.
- What is that?

02:15.241 --> 02:17.874
His man-bun. Someone cut it off
while he was sleeping.

02:25.216 --> 02:27.917
That is not a problem.

02:27.952 --> 02:31.020
That is television gold.

02:31.055 --> 02:32.589
I have to go.

02:35.393 --> 02:37.459
Rachel.

02:37.495 --> 02:39.195
I went looking for you this morning.

02:39.230 --> 02:41.931
Do you actually live in that truck?

02:42.934 --> 02:44.967
Boundaries. You ever heard of them?

02:45.003 --> 02:46.302
I'm just concerned, okay?

02:46.337 --> 02:47.703
You opened up a lot last night.

02:47.738 --> 02:49.105
That can be destabilizing.

02:49.140 --> 02:50.739
Okay, uh, well,

02:50.775 --> 02:52.708
- maybe I said too much.
- No, you didn't.

02:52.743 --> 02:55.544
And this is why I think we
should keep working together...

02:55.579 --> 02:57.746
so that we can get to
the core of the issue.

02:57.782 --> 02:59.347
No, no, no. I-I-I... that's not what...

02:59.383 --> 03:01.517
I don't to keep
thinking about this, okay?

03:01.552 --> 03:03.218
I don't want to stir things up.

03:03.253 --> 03:04.486
I don't need that noise in my head.

03:04.522 --> 03:06.522
I just need to focus on my work.

03:06.557 --> 03:08.290
I mean, I found Serena.
I brought her here.

03:08.325 --> 03:10.758
I'm the one that saved her
from this princess shit.

03:10.794 --> 03:12.660
So I've got to keep my head
together for Quinn.

03:12.695 --> 03:14.595
I just need you to think about it.

03:14.631 --> 03:16.398
Look, I am actually
doing a good job here.

03:16.433 --> 03:18.066
I just want to keep doing it.

03:18.101 --> 03:19.500
Rachel, you're needed on set.

03:19.536 --> 03:20.802
Really?

03:20.837 --> 03:23.204
Yes, really.
This is what I've always done.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.772
This is how I feel in control.

03:24.808 --> 03:26.641
Huh, 'cause I thought you said
you were feeling

03:26.676 --> 03:28.576
out of control, dishonest,

03:28.611 --> 03:30.445
and a little fearful
of where it might lead.

03:30.480 --> 03:31.239
Can you please stop?

03:31.246 --> 03:32.953
What's wrong with these idiots?

03:32.982 --> 03:35.583
- I have to go.
- No, it's an absolute joke, mate.

03:35.618 --> 03:37.518
No, of course you won't stand up
and admit it, will you?

03:37.554 --> 03:37.979
Wow.

03:37.986 --> 03:39.259
Big and brave in the middle of the night

03:39.288 --> 03:41.621
but total chicken shit
when I'm standing right here...

03:41.657 --> 03:42.957
...wide awake.

03:42.992 --> 03:44.624
Simmer down, Samson.

03:44.660 --> 03:45.993
One camera on August

03:46.028 --> 03:47.828
and another camera on his mangled head.

03:47.863 --> 03:49.363
So, you guys are
seriously okay with this?

03:49.398 --> 03:50.897
- Yeah. Seriously.
- Where's Serena?

03:50.933 --> 03:52.366
She's in hair and make-up.

03:52.401 --> 03:53.934
I thought she should
have her rollers out.

03:53.970 --> 03:56.670
Oh, my God. Your story instincts
are ass backwards.

03:56.705 --> 03:59.172
Dan, fly in Serena now. Please.

03:59.207 --> 04:01.107
- Okay.
- You know, I think you're mixing me up

04:01.142 --> 04:03.076
with someone who doesn't have a
produced pilot at this network.

04:03.111 --> 04:04.444
Oh, really? What's it called?

04:04.480 --> 04:05.846
"Keeping Up With Gary's Sidepiece?"

04:05.881 --> 04:07.447
I am not his sidepiece.

04:07.483 --> 04:09.449
- He has taken me on vacation.
- Okay, let me guess.

04:09.485 --> 04:12.085
Oh, a lot of private weekends,
dinner alone by the fire.

04:12.120 --> 04:14.887
Madison, have you ever been
out in public with the man?

04:14.922 --> 04:16.721
What's going on?

04:16.757 --> 04:18.156
Which one of you did this?

04:18.192 --> 04:20.159
Huh?

04:21.596 --> 04:23.162
I know the plan today was for me to

04:23.198 --> 04:24.630
hear these guys pitch their dream dates,

04:24.665 --> 04:26.799
but I don't give a damn what they want.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.902
Hey, this frat-boy crap
is a huge turn-off.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.904
I only want a date with August.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.007
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.141
Well, that's not gonna work.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.877
I can go try to flip her.

04:37.912 --> 04:40.145
No, I can handle it. Who do you
want the date to be with?

04:40.180 --> 04:41.580
- Alexi.
- Done.

04:41.616 --> 04:43.949
Okay. Someone had their coffee
this morning.

04:43.985 --> 04:45.217
Maybe you should try
putting some of that

04:45.252 --> 04:46.818
down your throat, Madison.

04:46.853 --> 04:49.488
Oh, Robin, I'd like you to meet
um, Quinn King.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.523
She's my, uh, showrunner.

04:51.558 --> 04:53.758
This is Robin Carr.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.327
She's from The National Page.

04:55.362 --> 04:57.396
She's gonna be writing a story about

04:57.431 --> 04:59.664
some of the important issues
we're gonna be tackling

04:59.699 --> 05:01.099
this season on "Everlasting."

05:01.135 --> 05:02.467
Oh, well, it's nice to meet you.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.468
I'm just curious to know
why you didn't air

05:04.504 --> 05:06.838
the interview footage Chet
showed me from last episode.

05:06.873 --> 05:08.840
It's so zeitgeisty.

05:08.875 --> 05:12.911
That is an excellent
and... nuanced question.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.579
Um, could you just give us
three seconds?

05:14.614 --> 05:16.347
- Sure.
- Thank you.

05:16.382 --> 05:18.249
If you're trying to get me to
pick someone else for the date,

05:18.284 --> 05:19.417
it's a waste of time.

05:19.452 --> 05:21.385
Listen, I totally get it.

05:21.421 --> 05:23.120
I'm just afraid that

05:23.156 --> 05:25.022
you're making it a little
too easy for him.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.623
Oh, my God.

05:26.659 --> 05:30.027
First I'm strident, unappealing,
and now I'm too easy.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.662
You said it yourself.
With these kind of guys,

05:31.697 --> 05:33.364
you've got to play
catch and release, right?

05:33.399 --> 05:35.032
You got to pull back to draw them in.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.767
So I'm supposed to play a game? Again?

05:36.802 --> 05:38.101
This whole thing is a game.

05:38.136 --> 05:39.570
You know that better than anyone.

05:39.605 --> 05:41.605
Having a reporter on the set

05:41.640 --> 05:43.373
is like DEFCON-level dangerous.

05:43.408 --> 05:46.142
Hey. We need the publicity
for my Emmy campaign.

05:46.178 --> 05:49.079
Plus, it's good for the sho...
You should be thanking me.

05:49.114 --> 05:50.614
Okay, what you know about publicity

05:50.649 --> 05:52.115
I could fit in a nipple cup.

05:52.150 --> 05:53.583
Is that thing?

05:53.618 --> 05:56.052
Listen, your, uh,
pal from The National Page

05:56.088 --> 05:57.720
is a real-ass reporter.

05:57.755 --> 05:59.389
And real-ass reporters have one goal

05:59.424 --> 06:01.424
and that is to dig shit up.

06:01.460 --> 06:04.461
She's here for me, Quinn, okay?
Let me handle it.

06:04.496 --> 06:05.895
So, let's just think about this, right?

06:05.930 --> 06:08.364
Like, who would make August
the most jealous?

06:08.400 --> 06:10.733
It would have to be
somebody sophisticated.

06:10.768 --> 06:12.267
Like Guy?

06:12.303 --> 06:15.004
I don't know. All he wants
to do is talk about food.

06:15.039 --> 06:17.206
I mean, you want someone

06:17.241 --> 06:20.342
soulful, well-traveled.

06:21.512 --> 06:23.312
Like Alexi?

06:24.148 --> 06:26.014
He could work.

06:26.049 --> 06:27.649
Okay.

06:27.684 --> 06:29.451
But if I go on the date with Alexi,

06:29.487 --> 06:30.852
I still want time with August later.

06:30.887 --> 06:32.488
All right, fine. How's this...

06:32.523 --> 06:35.424
you pick Alexi, and I will have
August waiting in your room

06:35.459 --> 06:38.127
for some alone time, off camera.

06:38.162 --> 06:39.461
Atta girl.

06:39.497 --> 06:41.396
There you go.

06:44.167 --> 06:45.233
So?

06:45.268 --> 06:47.502
- On board.
- Excellent.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.370
No, that is what we always do.

06:49.405 --> 06:51.606
I want you to take me
somewhere in public.

06:51.642 --> 06:53.474
I heard Chez Panisse has
a new tasting menu.

06:53.510 --> 06:55.143
Fine, I'll make a reservation.

06:55.178 --> 06:58.946
Oh, um, I have good news
about your pilot.

06:58.981 --> 07:00.314
Oh, my God, really? What is it?

07:00.350 --> 07:02.350
I'll, uh, tell you tonight.

07:02.385 --> 07:03.851
Okay.

07:03.886 --> 07:05.386
Quinn.

07:05.421 --> 07:07.522
Now what? Yes?

07:08.691 --> 07:10.625
Listen, I'm concerned about Rachel.

07:10.660 --> 07:11.892
Oh, seriously?

07:11.927 --> 07:13.561
I actually think she's doing great,

07:13.596 --> 07:14.728
so thanks for swinging by.

07:14.764 --> 07:16.897
She's not great.

07:16.932 --> 07:18.532
We had a real powerful session
last night,

07:18.567 --> 07:20.000
and she told me some things that...

07:20.036 --> 07:21.501
Oh, what did she tell you?

07:21.537 --> 07:23.037
- That's confidential.
- It better be.

07:23.072 --> 07:24.471
I'm just happy she's finally talking,

07:24.506 --> 07:25.973
'cause from what I can tell,

07:26.008 --> 07:27.240
she hasn't had a lot of people
to confide in,

07:27.276 --> 07:28.876
which is why our work is so vital.

07:28.911 --> 07:31.478
Okay sorry. Your "work"?

07:31.513 --> 07:33.346
Why don't you slow your roll, dude.

07:33.382 --> 07:34.847
All right?

07:34.883 --> 07:36.149
That was not part of our deal.

07:36.185 --> 07:37.817
You are a safety net, okay?

07:37.852 --> 07:40.353
You are a walking Xanax dispenser.

07:40.389 --> 07:43.223
You are not here to deep-dive
into Rachel's psyche.

07:43.258 --> 07:45.024
I'm here to help my patient.

07:46.061 --> 07:47.327
Or don't you want that?

07:47.362 --> 07:49.962
Oh, what, now I'm getting shrinked?

07:49.998 --> 07:53.532
Oh, do you want to talk about
my mean mommy?

07:53.568 --> 07:55.367
Love to.

07:57.538 --> 08:00.206
The things that have happened here...

08:00.241 --> 08:02.075
I don't know how you're handling it,

08:02.110 --> 08:04.743
but I can tell you right now,
there is no way Rachel

08:04.778 --> 08:07.680
could just stuff it all down
and ignore it.

08:07.715 --> 08:11.049
She's on a collision course,
Quinn, that I am trying to stop.

08:11.085 --> 08:12.918
So either help me or get ready.

08:12.953 --> 08:15.187
Because sooner or later,

08:15.252 --> 08:17.518
she's gonna blow.

08:37.397 --> 08:39.163
Hey, babe.

08:39.198 --> 08:41.065
No, I know. I'm sorry.

08:41.101 --> 08:44.001
I... I've just been really busy. Uh...

08:44.035 --> 08:46.336
No. Actually, Quinn's, like,

08:46.372 --> 08:48.839
really excited to take the pitch
to the network.

08:48.875 --> 08:51.174
No, Xave, stop. It's j...

08:51.210 --> 08:52.877
Obviously she thinks you're incredible.

08:52.912 --> 08:54.979
She wants you to be
a big part of the show.

08:58.283 --> 09:01.885
Yeah, I love you, too.

09:05.891 --> 09:08.325
Hey, Alexi...

09:08.360 --> 09:10.894
So, um, I-I just, uh,
wanted to let you know,

09:10.929 --> 09:12.262
I wrote up a couple things
for you to say

09:12.297 --> 09:14.531
when you pitch Serena
your dream date today.

09:14.566 --> 09:15.899
Uh, which is, uh...

09:15.934 --> 09:17.567
Wait a minute.

09:17.602 --> 09:20.102
So you making me learn lines
like puppet?

09:20.138 --> 09:22.238
Oh, dude, it's like three lines.

09:24.475 --> 09:26.943
This is just great...
career hitting rock bottom.

09:26.978 --> 09:28.611
Yeah, well, um, I...

09:28.647 --> 09:30.479
There's something else I need to
talk to you about, actually.

09:31.949 --> 09:33.082
We kissed.

09:33.117 --> 09:34.550
So what?

09:34.585 --> 09:36.519
Get over me.

09:39.957 --> 09:40.519
♪ I can feel it ♪

09:40.589 --> 09:43.231
You and I will gallop along
the beach at Point Reyes,

09:43.261 --> 09:44.993
maybe take our horses out into the surf

09:45.029 --> 09:46.795
if you don't mind getting
just a little bit...

09:46.830 --> 09:48.263
wet.

09:48.298 --> 09:49.898
We'll go for a ride. You drive.

09:49.934 --> 09:52.668
You, me, and an afternoon
in the park with my boy Lou.

09:52.703 --> 09:54.636
You and I will spend the day
sailing with the dolphins

09:54.672 --> 09:57.238
and sipping on the finest champagne.

09:58.508 --> 09:59.975
I'll show you real magic.

10:00.010 --> 10:01.810
Quality time with no distractions.

10:01.845 --> 10:04.479
Just you and me and... beautiful stars.

10:07.850 --> 10:10.585
You have heard all eight dreamy dates,

10:10.620 --> 10:13.321
Serena, some truly dreamy.

10:13.356 --> 10:15.256
Somebody hose Graham down.

10:15.292 --> 10:19.026
But only one can become
a dream come true.

10:19.062 --> 10:20.928
Thank you for putting so much...

10:20.964 --> 10:22.763
creativity into your pitches.

10:22.799 --> 10:26.734
Uh, but there really is only one
dream date for me.

10:29.238 --> 10:30.738
Alexi.

10:34.243 --> 10:36.644
- Yes!
- Whoa.

10:36.679 --> 10:39.079
Thank you, thank you.
All right, and that is a cut.

10:39.115 --> 10:41.014
Rachel, nice job.

10:41.049 --> 10:42.349
You are killing it.

10:42.384 --> 10:43.883
- Hey.
- What's... What's going on?

10:43.919 --> 10:45.852
Serena said she only wanted
a date with me.

10:45.887 --> 10:47.221
What do you care?

10:47.256 --> 10:49.055
You're lucky you're still here.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.731
How you doing?

10:57.766 --> 11:00.199
'Cause you kind of seem like
you're on fire.

11:00.235 --> 11:01.534
I know, right?

11:01.569 --> 11:03.136
Yeah, no. I'm good. I'm really good.

11:03.171 --> 11:05.038
Okay, good.

11:05.073 --> 11:07.040
Because I know
I said some words yesterday.

11:07.075 --> 11:08.407
Yes, I know.

11:08.443 --> 11:09.876
And, um,

11:09.911 --> 11:11.977
I've taken those words to heart.

11:12.013 --> 11:13.946
I don't want to be the curse anymore.

11:13.981 --> 11:15.814
No, I never said
you were the curse. I...

11:15.850 --> 11:18.351
It doesn't even matter, Quinn. I just...

11:18.386 --> 11:19.918
Look, I just want you to know

11:19.954 --> 11:21.720
that I am, like, fully committed.

11:21.756 --> 11:23.022
My mind is clear.
I just... I don't know.

11:24.559 --> 11:25.724
I just really want to
give you everything

11:25.760 --> 11:28.393
that you need to make an amazing show.

11:28.428 --> 11:30.228
Okay, you know what? Tell you what.

11:30.264 --> 11:33.098
Uh, if you want to give me what I need,

11:33.134 --> 11:35.701
then I'd like you to
go on the date with Alexi.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.536
Get him to sizzle.

11:37.571 --> 11:41.073
And get his sizzle all over Serena.

11:45.445 --> 11:49.047
Adrienne Idalis doesn't do
private performances. Ever.

11:49.082 --> 11:50.549
She's doing it for you,

11:50.584 --> 11:52.284
so you should be
really excited about it.

11:52.319 --> 11:55.820
Dragging lonely businesswoman
to ballet. Big whoop.

11:55.855 --> 11:58.756
You know, I thought you and me,
we had a connection.

11:59.893 --> 12:02.359
So, why are you making me do this?

12:02.395 --> 12:06.931
I think this could be a really
great opportunity for you...

12:06.966 --> 12:08.866
and Natalia.

12:10.170 --> 12:12.003
You know about Natalia?

12:12.038 --> 12:15.406
The woman who broke your heart?

12:15.441 --> 12:17.941
The reason you went on
a public coke binge

12:17.976 --> 12:20.143
which led to your dismissal
from the Royal Ballet?

12:20.179 --> 12:22.446
- That Natalia?
- We haven't been in touch, okay?

12:22.481 --> 12:24.881
Okay, well, she's been tweeting
up a storm about the show,

12:24.917 --> 12:27.017
so she's watching you.

12:27.052 --> 12:28.885
Natalia's tweeting me? That's good.

12:28.921 --> 12:30.954
Don't shine for
"the lonely businesswoman."

12:32.258 --> 12:34.891
Shine for Natalia.

12:34.927 --> 12:37.894
It'll destroy her.

12:43.836 --> 12:45.535
Seriously?

12:45.570 --> 12:47.604
You're producing my guy again.

12:47.639 --> 12:49.805
Dude...

12:49.841 --> 12:51.741
You should be happy.

12:51.776 --> 12:54.310
Come on. Alexi's into the date now.

12:54.346 --> 12:56.246
I was gonna use Natalia
when I needed it.

12:56.281 --> 12:58.147
It is not up to you to decide
when I play my ace, Rachel.

12:58.182 --> 12:59.815
Why do you even care?

12:59.851 --> 13:01.751
Okay, you know that this is
what we need him for.

13:01.786 --> 13:04.920
You have no idea
about what it is that I need.

13:06.357 --> 13:08.657
You're a piece of work, Rachel.
Just stay out of my business.

13:19.303 --> 13:20.770
Are you coming or what?!

13:22.339 --> 13:24.339
That reporter is real trouble.

13:24.375 --> 13:26.708
I can already feel her
climbing into my asshole.

13:26.744 --> 13:28.009
She's actually a pretty good writer.

13:28.044 --> 13:29.344
I've read some of her articles.

13:29.380 --> 13:30.812
You know, I know girls just like her.

13:30.847 --> 13:32.314
Looking for a big story

13:32.349 --> 13:34.583
so she can make a real name for herself.

13:34.618 --> 13:36.318
Ohh.

13:37.788 --> 13:40.155
We should give it to her.

13:40.190 --> 13:41.956
Today's your lucky day, Mini-Me.

13:43.593 --> 13:45.794
Rachel and Jay are off campus,
so you're up.

13:45.829 --> 13:47.195
Get ready.

13:47.230 --> 13:48.930
We're gonna blow up this man-bun thing.

13:48.965 --> 13:51.666
We're gonna go full Bun-ghazi.

13:53.336 --> 13:55.103
N-Normally, I would be
really excited about this,

13:55.138 --> 13:57.371
but I actually have to
leave early tonight.

13:57.407 --> 14:00.374
I have a dinner with Gary
at Chez Panisse.

14:01.778 --> 14:03.143
Huh.

14:03.179 --> 14:05.045
So that wasn't just a one-time thing.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.580
Do I look not shocked?

14:06.616 --> 14:07.881
'Cause that's what I'm going for.

14:07.917 --> 14:09.650
It's just for work. It's about my pilot.

14:09.686 --> 14:11.352
Yeah, I bet it is.

14:11.387 --> 14:13.753
Look, you are always saying that
you want to be just like me,

14:13.789 --> 14:16.623
but all you've done
is sucked off my fiancé

14:16.658 --> 14:18.358
and spread your legs for my boss.

14:18.393 --> 14:21.394
So, if you want to earn
real power and respect,

14:21.430 --> 14:23.663
you're gonna have to step into
your balls and grab it.

14:23.699 --> 14:25.532
Be your own woman.

14:25.567 --> 14:27.835
Not somebody else's bitch.

14:30.966 --> 14:34.571
The quest for Serena's heart

14:34.720 --> 14:39.756
has taken a mysterious
and a violent turn.

14:39.791 --> 14:42.626
But we will unearth the truth.

14:42.661 --> 14:46.962
And attempt to heal the wounds
of our fractured brotherhood.

14:47.124 --> 14:49.124
Welcome...

14:49.369 --> 14:52.437
to the Man-Bun Inquisition.

14:52.473 --> 14:55.006
You know, the, uh, Inquisition,

14:55.041 --> 14:59.111
uh, isn't uh, just about
who attacked August but why.

14:59.146 --> 15:01.846
What are the roots,
the values of male aggression.

15:01.881 --> 15:03.348
It's very of it's moment, you know?

15:03.383 --> 15:05.450
It's very "Lord of the Flies."

15:09.322 --> 15:11.455
So, welcome to backstage.

15:11.491 --> 15:13.858
Those are riggers. They hoist...

15:13.893 --> 15:15.459
- Mm.
- ...scenery.

15:15.495 --> 15:17.629
- That's very important.
- Oh, yeah. It's a...

15:17.664 --> 15:20.865
whole magical world.

15:20.900 --> 15:22.533
Why is this so hard for him?

15:22.568 --> 15:24.001
Why can't he just be happier?

15:24.036 --> 15:26.770
- This is him happy. Okay? He's Russian.
- Ugh.

15:26.805 --> 15:27.904
Wait a minute.

15:27.940 --> 15:29.173
Sergei?

15:29.208 --> 15:30.641
I can't believe it!

15:30.676 --> 15:32.176
- Alexi!
- Seryoga!

15:39.018 --> 15:40.851
Ahh!

15:42.855 --> 15:45.288
Jay, this is very good friend of mine

15:45.323 --> 15:47.157
from Mariinsky Theatre
in Saint Petersburg.

15:47.192 --> 15:48.491
Can I have two minutes to catch up?

15:48.527 --> 15:50.127
Yeah. I mean... yeah. Definitely.

15:50.162 --> 15:51.662
We should get all this on camera
anyway, so it's good.

15:51.697 --> 15:53.063
No, no, no. No camera. No camera, okay?

15:53.098 --> 15:54.765
Just two minutes alone with my brother.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.666
- No, no, no. I can't.
- Come on. Two minutes. It's nothing.

15:56.701 --> 16:00.069
You're the cool one. So be cool. For me.

16:00.104 --> 16:02.905
Hm?

16:02.940 --> 16:04.740
Two minutes.

16:04.776 --> 16:06.108
Great.

16:06.144 --> 16:09.212
You're bleeding Instagram followers.

16:09.247 --> 16:13.182
I mean, you're down 300,000
since the season started.

16:13.217 --> 16:14.249
How... How is that possible?

16:14.285 --> 16:15.785
You're just not popping.

16:15.820 --> 16:17.920
Yo, this can't be happening, man.

16:17.955 --> 16:19.488
I told my publicist taking me offline

16:19.523 --> 16:21.123
for six weeks was suicide.

16:21.159 --> 16:24.459
You just need to figure out
a way to make some noise.

16:24.495 --> 16:26.062
I mean, you know what you could do?

16:26.097 --> 16:30.065
You could confess to
cutting off August's man-bun.

16:30.100 --> 16:31.366
- That's noisy.
- Yeah.

16:31.402 --> 16:32.668
Are you high?

16:32.703 --> 16:34.369
"A," I didn't do that puss move,

16:34.405 --> 16:36.771
"B," everybody would
hate my ass if I claimed it.

16:36.807 --> 16:38.407
Serena would definitely chop me.

16:39.910 --> 16:41.577
What's that look?
Can y... Can y'all talk to me?

16:43.046 --> 16:45.880
Look, we weren't
gonna tell you this, okay?

16:45.916 --> 16:48.449
But we heard from Serena

16:48.484 --> 16:50.852
that she's probably cutting you
tonight anyway.

16:50.887 --> 16:52.386
What?!

16:52.422 --> 16:56.290
Who will lead us into
the pathway of light?

16:56.326 --> 16:57.458
Come on.

16:57.493 --> 16:58.893
Somebody knows the truth here.

16:58.929 --> 17:00.294
Open your hearts and be honest.

17:00.330 --> 17:02.296
- Come on, Zach. Come on.
- Anyone? Huh?

17:02.332 --> 17:04.531
You can do this. Own it. Own it, buddy.

17:04.567 --> 17:05.766
What are you, a coward?

17:05.800 --> 17:07.101
Oh, Graham, give me the damn stick.

17:07.136 --> 17:08.135
Thank you.

17:08.170 --> 17:09.569
This is ridiculous.

17:09.606 --> 17:11.137
So we all have roommates.

17:11.173 --> 17:13.708
So, at least two of us know
who snuck out last night

17:13.742 --> 17:16.544
to, uh... to scalp Mr. Augie up.

17:16.579 --> 17:18.278
Yeah, I'd like to know.

17:18.313 --> 17:20.547
I did it.

17:20.582 --> 17:21.580
Huh?

17:21.617 --> 17:22.950
It was me.

17:22.984 --> 17:25.285
I snipped off his weak-ass man-bun.

17:25.319 --> 17:26.286
I did it.

17:26.320 --> 17:27.788
- Oh!
- And I liked it.

17:27.823 --> 17:29.089
- Good one.
- Hey!

17:29.125 --> 17:30.958
- Good one, Zach.
- Good job.

17:30.993 --> 17:32.325
Good job, man.

17:32.361 --> 17:33.827
Where is Alexi?

17:33.863 --> 17:35.862
Honestly, what is going on with you?

17:35.897 --> 17:38.298
Look, I am freaking out, okay?
I lied to Quinn.

17:38.333 --> 17:40.433
I told her Alexi already agreed
to host "Passport to Dance."

17:40.469 --> 17:42.068
But I haven't even talked to him
about it yet.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.336
Are you kidding? Jay, seriously?

17:43.372 --> 17:45.372
She's getting fitted for a custom suit.

17:45.407 --> 17:47.540
I know. But I promised Xavier
he could host,

17:47.576 --> 17:49.376
like, way before any of this, Rach.

17:49.411 --> 17:51.610
You have no idea what
this empire thing means to her.

17:51.646 --> 17:52.845
- Rachel...
- What?

17:52.881 --> 17:54.513
Rach, please don't say anything.

17:54.548 --> 17:56.315
I can't get wrapped up in
any more dishonesty, Jay.

17:56.350 --> 17:58.284
- I am so sorry. I just can't.
- You know, it's cool.

17:58.319 --> 18:00.486
You know, you've never kept
anything from Quinn anyway.

18:00.521 --> 18:02.354
Really? Handle your shit, Jay, okay?

18:02.390 --> 18:04.157
Get Alexi on board now.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.559
Jay Carter as I live and breathe.

18:07.595 --> 18:10.696
O-M-G, I love that look of shock
on your gorgeous face.

18:10.731 --> 18:12.398
This is exactly what I wanted...

18:12.433 --> 18:14.366
to catch your organized,
fussy ass unawares.

18:14.402 --> 18:16.134
- Come here.
- Xave, what are you...

18:17.237 --> 18:18.537
What are you doing here?

18:18.572 --> 18:20.205
I'm here for the pitch, boo.

18:20.240 --> 18:22.708
It's Sissy Bounce. And
I'm the bounce bounce, right?

18:22.743 --> 18:25.143
Yeah, you are. You're the bounce.

18:25.179 --> 18:26.377
All right. All right.
Shut up. This is insane.

18:26.413 --> 18:28.246
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

18:28.282 --> 18:30.248
Zach is lying. It wasn't him. I did it.

18:30.284 --> 18:31.580
- You know... You know I did it.
- Sit down, man.

18:31.597 --> 18:32.300
Here's the truth.

18:32.352 --> 18:33.852
I grabbed his little nub...
didn't like it...

18:33.887 --> 18:35.187
- and I hacked it off,
- okay?

18:35.222 --> 18:36.855
Sit down! Come on, man, we all know...

18:36.890 --> 18:38.190
Get the producers out here.

18:38.225 --> 18:39.757
There are security cameras.

18:39.793 --> 18:41.192
Come on. Cut these cameras.

18:41.227 --> 18:42.760
I know you know what I'm talking about.

18:42.796 --> 18:44.629
Do you have the security footage?

18:44.664 --> 18:45.630
Boo!

18:45.665 --> 18:47.665
Of course I do.

18:47.701 --> 18:49.367
- Xave, this is Rachel.
- Hi.

18:52.372 --> 18:54.405
Girl, you mean so much to my baby,

18:54.441 --> 18:56.006
so you mean so much to me.

18:57.076 --> 18:58.042
Alexi's ready, beautiful people!

18:58.077 --> 19:01.178
Let's do this!

19:03.149 --> 19:05.115
Oh, my God. It's you. It's him.

19:05.151 --> 19:06.550
Jay loves to talk you up.

19:06.585 --> 19:09.186
I have seen you bounce, bounce, bounce.

19:09.222 --> 19:10.020
Holy moly.

19:10.056 --> 19:13.724
You're Alexi Petrov.

19:13.759 --> 19:17.394
And you are super lucky sissy
to this silky man.

19:17.429 --> 19:18.695
Mm.

19:37.415 --> 19:39.082
Her soul is singing,

19:39.117 --> 19:42.218
each movement a note.

19:47.124 --> 19:49.358
This is divinity!

19:57.568 --> 19:58.667
You're crazy!

20:05.242 --> 20:09.278
Raise a glass to the God of the Gravity!

20:11.148 --> 20:13.949
And those who defy it!

20:16.353 --> 20:18.320
So, he's playing straight.

20:18.355 --> 20:19.821
No, he is straight.

20:19.856 --> 20:21.255
He's very straight.

20:21.291 --> 20:22.657
Please.

20:22.692 --> 20:25.794
I have got to focus on this
right now, okay?

20:25.829 --> 20:28.430
We can talk more after wrap, I promise.

20:28.465 --> 20:32.333
Flesh and bone

20:32.368 --> 20:35.537
and blood and grit!

20:35.572 --> 20:38.505
All catapulting...

20:39.842 --> 20:42.843
...in the air!

20:44.380 --> 20:46.314
Bravo!

20:48.251 --> 20:51.152
We have uncovered footage

20:51.187 --> 20:52.820
from the midnight scalping of August.

20:52.855 --> 20:54.154
This is the moment of truth.

20:54.189 --> 20:56.323
For Zach. For Billy.

20:56.358 --> 20:58.625
For America.

20:58.661 --> 21:00.461
- Do it, Graham. Play it.
- Okay, boys.

21:00.496 --> 21:05.031
Moment of truth, boys. Get ready for it.

21:05.067 --> 21:06.533
Here it comes.

21:08.637 --> 21:10.337
Hey!

21:10.372 --> 21:11.838
I told you! I told you!

21:11.873 --> 21:14.340
- No, no, no, no, no.
- That should be my face.

21:14.375 --> 21:16.475
You wiped my... you wiped
my face, snipping that thing!

21:16.510 --> 21:17.943
- They wiped my...
- No!

21:17.979 --> 21:19.478
Come on.

21:19.513 --> 21:21.546
That Billy, he's, like,
a bit of a wackadoo.

21:21.582 --> 21:23.983
I think you might need to
go check under his hood.

21:24.018 --> 21:25.717
Yeah. I have a feeling I know
exactly what I'm dealing with.

21:27.221 --> 21:29.888
Yeah, this is why we have
a psychologist on staff.

21:29.923 --> 21:32.190
You know, things can get a bit intense.

21:32.225 --> 21:34.225
Yeah, well, you don't want
another contestant

21:34.260 --> 21:35.927
jumping off the roof, do you?

21:37.397 --> 21:39.030
Yeah, yeah.

21:39.065 --> 21:41.232
Hey, Zach is really something, huh?

21:41.267 --> 21:43.535
Big heart, huge star power.

21:43.570 --> 21:46.904
I actually brought him over from
my pilot, "Hashtag Adulting."

21:46.939 --> 21:49.173
You shot a pilot?
Did you do it together?

21:49.209 --> 21:50.541
Oh, no. I did it on my own.

21:50.576 --> 21:51.775
Oh, yeah, this one here,

21:51.811 --> 21:54.345
she's on a real, uh, meteoric rise.

21:54.381 --> 21:56.714
Tell her, Madison.

21:56.749 --> 21:58.716
How you zipped up the ladder.

21:58.758 --> 22:00.758
Or was it un-zipped?

22:00.786 --> 22:03.921
I always get those two confused.

22:12.973 --> 22:14.840
- You okay?
- The king is back!

22:16.143 --> 22:17.509
Mmmmmmmm mmmmm mmmmmm!

22:17.552 --> 22:18.984
Okay. Come on, let's go.
Let's get you inside.

22:19.012 --> 22:20.579
I know... I know I signed a contract.

22:20.645 --> 22:23.149
- But I didn't sign for this!
- Hey, let's go, Alexi.

22:23.185 --> 22:25.285
Let's get you... let's go.

22:25.352 --> 22:27.519
Thank you for convincing me
to go on that date.

22:27.551 --> 22:30.574
I have... I have no words
for what just happened.

22:30.637 --> 22:32.971
- That was... That was nuts.
- Oh, my God.

22:33.006 --> 22:34.873
Okay, but I still want my time
with August tonight.

22:34.908 --> 22:36.407
I-I still think he's the one.

22:36.443 --> 22:38.042
Absolutely.

22:38.078 --> 22:40.544
He's gonna be in your room
after the elimination ceremony.

22:40.580 --> 22:42.347
Thank you.

22:55.140 --> 22:57.140
We need to talk.

22:57.176 --> 22:59.142
Excuse me, are you Rachel Goldberg?

22:59.178 --> 23:01.178
My least favorite question.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.313
Hi. I'm Robin Carr
from The National Page.

23:03.349 --> 23:04.882
You're Quinn's number two, right?

23:04.917 --> 23:06.984
Yes. It's 2 or 10 depending on the day.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.386
I would love to talk to you.

23:08.421 --> 23:10.320
Actually, we need to...

23:10.356 --> 23:12.655
We're gonna go. Excuse us.

23:15.194 --> 23:17.961
You know, Rachel isn't her number two.

23:17.997 --> 23:20.430
We're all producers,
so we aren't ranked.

23:20.465 --> 23:21.999
Technically that's true.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.967
Oh, excuse me. Got to get this.

23:24.003 --> 23:26.136
Ah, my girlfriend. How are you?

23:26.171 --> 23:29.105
Oh, no, no, no, no. That...
That... That's for the lights.

23:29.140 --> 23:31.007
The other button is for the bubbles.

23:32.511 --> 23:35.111
So, what's it like working for Quinn?

23:35.146 --> 23:37.480
I've heard a lot about her,
not all positive.

23:37.516 --> 23:39.348
I probably shouldn't say anything.

23:39.384 --> 23:41.718
Ooh, now I'm intrigued.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.686
The word is, aside from Rachel,

23:43.722 --> 23:45.854
female producers don't really
last around here.

23:46.664 --> 23:48.964
I just need to make things right, okay?

23:48.993 --> 23:51.160
'Cause, like, Serena trusts me.
I just can't keep lying to her.

23:51.195 --> 23:53.195
I had sex with August a few times.

23:53.231 --> 23:55.064
- It's over. Move on.
- I know. But she's into him

23:55.099 --> 23:56.532
because of what he said to her
on the date,

23:56.567 --> 23:58.067
- but he was talking to you.
- Wait.

23:58.102 --> 24:00.969
So, what we're producing on
"Everlasting" isn't real?

24:01.004 --> 24:05.808
I think Quinn is threatened
by younger, ambitious women.

24:05.843 --> 24:08.577
Mm-hmm. No, I can totally see that.

24:08.612 --> 24:11.146
But I mean, she's still
a phenomenon, right?

24:15.920 --> 24:17.352
She's a mess.

24:17.387 --> 24:19.421
She's been drinking on set.

24:19.456 --> 24:21.389
The network president caught her.

24:21.425 --> 24:23.624
And he told me, privately, of course,

24:23.660 --> 24:26.594
that she's on her way out.

24:26.629 --> 24:28.396
They just don't trust her anymore.

24:28.432 --> 24:31.566
Well, you seem like a real up-and-comer.

24:31.601 --> 24:33.868
Thank you. I think the network
thinks so, too.

24:33.903 --> 24:35.670
Mm-hmm.

24:35.705 --> 24:37.839
Hey, you know what
I could use your help with?

24:37.874 --> 24:39.373
Serena.

24:39.408 --> 24:41.041
They've been trying to
keep her away from me all day,

24:41.077 --> 24:44.178
but it would seriously make
my story if I could talk to her.

24:44.213 --> 24:47.582
I can definitely help you with that.

24:50.719 --> 24:52.853
Quinn, I just can't keep
doing this, okay?

24:52.888 --> 24:54.254
I'm, like, trying harder than you know,

24:54.290 --> 24:56.357
but I really need to
get back to being honest.

24:56.392 --> 24:58.925
No, you don't. Just stop it, okay?

24:58.961 --> 25:00.660
You cannot do this job

25:00.696 --> 25:02.396
and be essentially honest
at the same time.

25:02.431 --> 25:05.165
And I am sorry if that is gonna
make you explode or whatever,

25:05.201 --> 25:06.900
but you just have to let it go.

25:06.935 --> 25:09.068
Okay, well, I can't, Quinn.

25:09.104 --> 25:11.671
I'm, like, barely hanging on here.

25:11.707 --> 25:13.172
I really need to do something.

25:21.282 --> 25:23.249
Hey. Can you give us a sec?

25:23.284 --> 25:24.650
- Sure.
- Thank you.

25:24.685 --> 25:26.585
So, Serena, this is Robin.

25:26.621 --> 25:28.587
Robin, Serena. You have five minutes.

25:28.623 --> 25:30.156
Thank you.

25:30.191 --> 25:31.657
What's going on?

25:31.692 --> 25:33.292
Hi.

25:33.328 --> 25:35.428
I'm writing a story on the show
for The National Page.

25:35.463 --> 25:36.829
Do you mind?

25:36.864 --> 25:39.198
Uh, no. Sure.

25:39.234 --> 25:41.534
I read that profile of you
in Flash Talk.

25:41.569 --> 25:43.268
It was really illuminating.

25:43.303 --> 25:44.670
Thank you.

25:44.705 --> 25:48.473
I'm just wondering how
a Silicon Valley baller

25:48.509 --> 25:51.610
let herself descend into
a literal damsel in distress

25:51.646 --> 25:54.112
- in a matter of weeks.
- Excuse me?

25:54.148 --> 25:57.782
I mean, what message are you
trying to send to women?

25:57.817 --> 26:00.318
I'm not sending any message.

26:00.354 --> 26:01.586
I'm just trying to find someone

26:01.621 --> 26:03.655
to spend the rest of my life with.

26:03.690 --> 26:07.992
Okay, look, the damsel thing
was a regrettable blip,

26:08.028 --> 26:10.762
but if you had seen my date with Alexi

26:10.797 --> 26:12.297
or the connection
that I have with August,

26:12.332 --> 26:13.765
you would know that
I have real options here.

26:13.800 --> 26:16.601
Oh, my God. You sound like
a kidnapping victim.

26:16.636 --> 26:19.270
You have to realize they are
manipulating you at every step.

26:19.305 --> 26:21.172
No, I'm a lot more in control
than you think.

26:21.207 --> 26:24.341
Okay. Serena, they've created
this whole man-bun investigation

26:24.377 --> 26:26.110
just to keep me occupied.

26:26.145 --> 26:27.679
Who knows what they're hiding here.

26:27.714 --> 26:29.713
This morning, I heard Rachel
convincing Alexi

26:29.748 --> 26:31.482
to pretend to be into you.

26:31.517 --> 26:32.816
What?

26:32.851 --> 26:34.485
These producers are monsters.

26:34.520 --> 26:35.852
And I'm gonna expose them.

26:35.888 --> 26:38.689
If I were you, I'd trust no one.

26:43.329 --> 26:45.896
Rachel?

26:45.931 --> 26:48.398
Have you been producing the guys
to like me?

26:48.433 --> 26:49.800
Who told you that?

26:49.835 --> 26:52.035
That reporter.
She saw you talking to Alexi.

26:52.071 --> 26:54.437
Come on. You told me you'd
always be straight with me.

26:54.473 --> 26:57.273
That is why I came on this show
in the first place.

26:57.309 --> 26:59.643
So just tell me
what the hell's going on.

27:03.081 --> 27:04.914
Okay, fine.

27:04.949 --> 27:07.250
Yeah, like, sometimes we do have to,

27:07.285 --> 27:09.051
you know, like,
push the guys a little bit.

27:09.087 --> 27:10.886
To like me?

27:12.524 --> 27:14.390
Okay, maybe Alexi.

27:14.426 --> 27:17.327
But not August.

27:19.063 --> 27:20.763
Oh, come on. You told me he was solid.

27:20.798 --> 27:23.633
You said it right to my face.

27:23.668 --> 27:26.368
Please don't make an ass
out of me, Rachel.

27:26.403 --> 27:28.704
I will not survive it.

27:28.740 --> 27:31.273
Okay, look, I, like,
legitimately thought

27:31.308 --> 27:32.908
that August was a good guy.

27:32.944 --> 27:34.376
I really did.

27:34.411 --> 27:35.910
And then... and then I found out...

27:35.946 --> 27:38.380
What? You found out what?

27:38.415 --> 27:39.814
August slept with Quinn.

27:39.850 --> 27:41.349
Okay, they had this whole thing.

27:41.384 --> 27:42.916
And she asked me
not to say anything to you,

27:42.952 --> 27:44.519
but it has absolutely been killing me.

27:44.554 --> 27:47.087
I am so sorry, Serena.
You deserve the truth.

27:53.329 --> 27:55.896
Rachel told you that
I slept with August?

27:58.567 --> 28:00.034
It's true.

28:00.069 --> 28:01.401
You're vile.

28:01.436 --> 28:04.138
You are everything that reporter
said you are.

28:04.173 --> 28:05.773
Obviously I am gonna cut your boy toy

28:05.808 --> 28:07.041
the second the cameras roll.

28:07.076 --> 28:08.408
All right, I wouldn't, okay?

28:08.443 --> 28:10.277
It's a mistake
to blame this all on August.

28:10.312 --> 28:12.846
You know what? I don't want to
hear your self-serving spin.

28:12.882 --> 28:15.415
Hey, we all make mistakes, right?

28:15.450 --> 28:18.351
I slept with August
and you slept with the jockey.

28:22.090 --> 28:23.890
Our bad.

28:23.925 --> 28:26.660
And besides, August
didn't even really know you

28:26.695 --> 28:28.761
when he slept with me.
Why not give him a chance?

28:28.797 --> 28:30.463
- Oh.
- Oh, come on.

28:30.499 --> 28:32.431
He is the hottest guy here.

28:32.466 --> 28:34.366
Unbelievable.

28:34.402 --> 28:36.769
None of this is anything like
it was supposed to be.

28:36.805 --> 28:38.604
You know what?

28:38.639 --> 28:40.606
From here on out,
I'm only dealing with Rachel.

28:40.641 --> 28:43.242
I don't trust you
as far as I can punt you.

28:48.019 --> 28:49.219
They're plastic but they're changed...

28:49.254 --> 28:50.386
Uh, excuse us, okay? We are done here.

28:50.421 --> 28:51.654
Are you kidding?

28:51.689 --> 28:54.005
You can write whatever you want,

28:54.052 --> 28:55.618
including me kicking you off our set.

28:55.654 --> 28:57.186
You know, I can't believe
that Madison thought

28:57.221 --> 28:59.388
that it was okay to let you
talk to our Suitress.

28:59.423 --> 29:00.990
How did you know it was Madison?

29:01.026 --> 29:02.158
I didn't.

29:02.193 --> 29:04.493
Until now. Dan!

29:04.529 --> 29:06.762
You know, it's surprising to me
that you're so rough on her.

29:06.797 --> 29:09.031
Because she's like
a younger version of you,

29:09.066 --> 29:11.700
even following your example of
sleeping your way to the top.

29:13.237 --> 29:15.371
You don't know me, okay?

29:15.406 --> 29:16.972
I rose up on this show

29:17.007 --> 29:19.775
after busting my ass for years
in the shadows

29:19.810 --> 29:21.309
until I finally got
the credit I deserved.

29:21.344 --> 29:24.846
It is so interesting
that you position yourself

29:24.882 --> 29:26.715
as this feminist hero.

29:26.750 --> 29:28.984
- I never said that.
- Good.

29:29.019 --> 29:31.486
'Cause I think what's really
happening is you hate yourself,

29:31.521 --> 29:32.854
which is why you've made it
your life's work

29:32.890 --> 29:33.722
to destroy other women.

29:33.757 --> 29:35.690
That's the real story here, Quinn.

29:35.725 --> 29:37.325
The real story... is you.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.661
Have a good night.

29:39.696 --> 29:41.796
My fact checker will be
getting in touch soon.

29:47.904 --> 29:48.536
I can't believe that woman.

29:48.572 --> 29:50.471
Did you talk to Serena?

29:50.507 --> 29:52.573
- Yes.
- And?

29:52.608 --> 29:54.709
And worked like a charm.

29:54.744 --> 29:58.012
She loathes me and loves you.

29:58.047 --> 30:01.415
So, we are back on
with you as her guide.

30:01.450 --> 30:04.051
Okay? Feel better? Super honest?

30:04.087 --> 30:05.619
Because I feel better.

30:05.654 --> 30:06.954
I mean, we all should feel better.

30:06.989 --> 30:09.256
Except Serena. But, you know, Kumbaya.

30:09.291 --> 30:10.890
Yeah, I should feel better.

30:10.926 --> 30:14.060
I mean, I definitely
thought I would, but, um...

30:14.096 --> 30:16.396
Rachel?

30:16.432 --> 30:18.832
What is going on?

30:18.867 --> 30:20.767
I've been talking to Dr. Simon.

30:20.802 --> 30:23.604
Yeah. I heard.

30:23.639 --> 30:25.504
I almost did something this morning.

30:25.540 --> 30:27.540
What did you do?

30:27.575 --> 30:29.408
You know what? Never mind.

30:29.444 --> 30:30.877
Rachel...

30:30.912 --> 30:33.213
This is not the time.
We have a lot of eyes on us,

30:33.248 --> 30:34.914
and you can't be going off the rails

30:34.950 --> 30:37.083
or doing a deep out with Dr. Simon.

30:37.119 --> 30:38.885
Okay, well, that's not what I'm doing.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.854
I'm just...

30:41.889 --> 30:43.922
I'm, like, fixing myself.

30:43.958 --> 30:46.125
What does that even mean?

30:46.160 --> 30:47.627
I mean, just produce the show,

30:47.662 --> 30:49.995
don't kill anybody, and you'll be fine.

30:50.030 --> 30:51.631
Don't you want me to get better?

30:51.666 --> 30:52.598
Of course I do.

30:52.634 --> 30:54.267
But just not now.

30:54.302 --> 30:56.335
I mean, can you just wait
till the season's over?

30:58.839 --> 31:00.405
No, I can't.

31:04.145 --> 31:05.778
I'm not waiting anymore.

31:14.688 --> 31:16.788
Hey, Alexi, d...

31:16.823 --> 31:18.356
Oh, my God.

31:20.126 --> 31:22.093
Where did you get...

31:22.128 --> 31:24.329
Is this what you were doing with Sergei?

31:24.364 --> 31:26.431
This is what makes me feel alive.

31:26.466 --> 31:28.633
It makes me be the man
Natalia wants me to be.

31:28.669 --> 31:30.134
Jay, where's Alexi?

31:30.170 --> 31:33.470
We need him for
the Elimination Ceremony.

31:33.506 --> 31:36.307
You need to get your shit
together and get dressed. Now.

31:41.714 --> 31:44.415
As the great Dostoyevksy might've said,

31:44.450 --> 31:46.983
there can be no crime
without punishment.

31:47.019 --> 31:50.354
And so it is time for Serena
to mete out justice.

31:50.389 --> 31:52.656
One contestant must be executed.

31:52.692 --> 31:54.124
From the show, obviously.

31:54.159 --> 31:56.026
And the rest will get their freedom.

31:56.061 --> 32:00.597
And a Coif Chopper DX
portable hair-cutting system.

32:00.633 --> 32:02.800
Because why settle for a hair cut

32:02.835 --> 32:04.667
when you can get a hair vacuum?

32:04.703 --> 32:07.003
Serena, who are you choices?

32:07.039 --> 32:10.673
Owen, will you stay?

32:10.709 --> 32:13.243
Guy, will you please stay?

32:14.913 --> 32:16.346
Warren, will you please stay?

32:16.381 --> 32:17.547
Okay.

32:17.582 --> 32:19.982
Alexi, will you please stay?

32:20.017 --> 32:21.851
No. Just joking.

32:23.722 --> 32:24.821
Here.

32:24.856 --> 32:26.522
Oh. Oh. Ohh.

32:26.558 --> 32:28.458
Finally somebody with something.

32:28.493 --> 32:30.326
Jasper, will you please stay?

32:30.362 --> 32:32.595
Wait till she finds out
about your bet, dick.

32:39.636 --> 32:41.971
August, will you please stay?

32:42.006 --> 32:43.438
Yeah.

32:43.474 --> 32:45.607
Good girl.

32:47.578 --> 32:49.544
Hey, where's Rachel?

32:49.580 --> 32:51.613
I haven't seen her since this morning.

32:55.285 --> 32:56.585
See you in the room later?

32:56.620 --> 32:59.320
Not a chance.

32:59.356 --> 33:02.023
And now just two remain.

33:02.058 --> 33:04.693
But only one can receive
a stay of execution.

33:04.728 --> 33:07.829
After everything that's happened today,

33:07.865 --> 33:09.663
I can safely say

33:09.699 --> 33:12.300
the most important quality
that I am looking for

33:12.335 --> 33:14.035
is honesty.

33:14.070 --> 33:17.738
At least one of you had the guts
to show your true colors.

33:18.808 --> 33:19.774
Zach.

33:19.809 --> 33:21.309
Bitch, what?

33:21.344 --> 33:22.977
You sure?

33:23.013 --> 33:24.445
No.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.447
Hey, this isn't right.
Get me a producer.

33:26.482 --> 33:27.082
Thank you.

33:27.089 --> 33:28.889
Okay, he's saying he
did it which he did not.

33:28.918 --> 33:31.351
And even if he did,
why are you not cutting him?

33:31.387 --> 33:33.053
Because I'm finally cutting you.

33:33.088 --> 33:34.154
Bitch.

33:34.189 --> 33:35.155
- Oh!
- That's very nice.

33:35.190 --> 33:36.891
No, you didn't!

33:36.926 --> 33:38.793
That's fantastic.

33:40.930 --> 33:42.495
We'll miss you.

33:47.769 --> 33:50.103
Okay, hey, and that's a cut, everybody.

33:50.139 --> 33:52.973
Well, I will miss Billy
but not his toothpicks.

33:54.143 --> 33:55.775
Hey, um, Jay.

33:55.811 --> 33:58.278
I got to tell you.
I saw the footage with Alexi.

33:58.314 --> 34:00.780
I don't know what you were doing
to keep him on his stride,

34:00.816 --> 34:02.048
but keep it coming.

34:02.083 --> 34:04.350
Because that is the Alexi we need.

34:07.054 --> 34:09.087
No, yeah, yeah. I understand.
That's fine.

34:10.724 --> 34:12.658
I can just meet you later.

34:18.165 --> 34:19.665
Chez Panisse?

34:21.467 --> 34:24.002
He had to work late.

34:24.036 --> 34:26.103
He's just gonna order in.

34:27.474 --> 34:28.672
Am I fired?

34:28.708 --> 34:30.308
'Cause that's what I do, right?

34:30.344 --> 34:32.944
Destroy other women?

34:38.551 --> 34:40.952
Come here.

34:43.889 --> 34:46.791
You don't get it, do you?

34:46.826 --> 34:49.860
I'm hard on you because
I'm trying to help you.

34:49.896 --> 34:52.563
Do you think Rachel
got so good at her job

34:52.599 --> 34:54.697
because I was nice to her?

34:54.733 --> 34:56.833
You should be looking for a career

34:56.869 --> 34:59.836
that lasts and means something.

34:59.872 --> 35:02.939
Slow down. All right?

35:02.975 --> 35:05.642
You're trying to cut to
the front of the line with Gary.

35:05.677 --> 35:08.812
And I promise you,
that is not going to end well.

35:11.617 --> 35:15.519
Does anybody have eyes on Rachel?

35:22.193 --> 35:24.227
May I help you?

35:24.262 --> 35:26.663
I'm Rachel Goldberg.

35:26.698 --> 35:29.032
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

35:29.067 --> 35:31.334
My mother is Olive Goldberg?

35:33.871 --> 35:35.271
She was your therapist?

35:36.541 --> 35:39.275
Oh, my God.

35:43.633 --> 35:47.298
- You lied to me.
- What? No, I did not.

35:47.486 --> 35:48.919
I said the food would be terrible

35:48.954 --> 35:50.153
but the view would be magnificent.

35:50.188 --> 35:51.955
You cannot question this view.

35:51.991 --> 35:53.423
I meant the wings.

35:53.458 --> 35:55.626
They're amazing. Sriracha?

35:55.661 --> 35:56.994
Cool. Yeah.

35:57.029 --> 35:58.461
I wasn't sure if you like spicy.

35:58.497 --> 36:00.296
Aw, you think these are spicy.

36:00.332 --> 36:01.797
- Aww.
- Mm.

36:02.867 --> 36:04.434
You always this happy?

36:04.469 --> 36:06.436
Why wouldn't I be?

36:06.471 --> 36:10.606
Working in TV's been a dream come true.

36:10.642 --> 36:13.076
I remember when I used to think
coming to work was fun.

36:13.111 --> 36:15.478

36:15.514 --> 36:17.180

36:35.066 --> 36:38.833

36:41.205 --> 36:43.439

drowning yourself,

36:43.474 --> 36:46.041
that coat looks awfully buoyant.

36:48.045 --> 36:50.879
Mind if I join you?

36:50.914 --> 36:52.847
No?

36:52.883 --> 36:55.917
This place is making
my head spin, as well.

36:55.953 --> 36:59.520
I'd offer you a sip, but, um,
I'm gonna need every drop.

37:14.704 --> 37:18.139
if you walked into Vertigo
and I was there...

37:21.377 --> 37:24.211
I'd get your number.

37:24.246 --> 37:26.880
And I definitely wouldn't let you leave

37:26.916 --> 37:30.417
before I made sure that it was real.

37:30.452 --> 37:32.086
And then I'd call you up

37:32.121 --> 37:35.823

It's always so noisy there.

37:47.902 --> 37:49.669
How... How's that torte?
That looks delicious.

37:49.704 --> 37:51.605
So, what's the exciting news
about my pilot?

37:51.640 --> 37:52.839
Did you finally watch it?

37:52.874 --> 37:55.375
Uh, you know, I wanted to.

37:55.410 --> 37:57.076
It's been a week from hell, honey.

37:57.112 --> 37:59.045
But the good news is

37:59.080 --> 38:03.349
Lenny, my assistant, watched it,
and he loves it.

38:03.384 --> 38:06.753
Um, actually, my head is pounding.

38:06.788 --> 38:08.154
Do you have any aspirin?

38:08.189 --> 38:09.956
Uh...

38:09.991 --> 38:12.558
Yeah. In the, uh, kitchen down the hall.

38:15.630 --> 38:17.095
I'll get it. How about that?

38:17.131 --> 38:18.964
And, um...

38:18.999 --> 38:20.065
Mmm.

38:20.100 --> 38:21.233
Oh, that is good.

38:21.269 --> 38:23.302
Save me some of that torte, okay?

38:45.159 --> 38:47.425
Okay, here's the deal.

38:49.062 --> 38:51.663
I'm pitching a show with Quinn
called "Passport to Dance,"

38:51.698 --> 38:53.764
and you're gonna be the star of it.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.667
What makes you think I'd do that?

38:59.072 --> 39:01.872
Look, I think I just need some closure.

39:01.908 --> 39:04.341
You know, about what you did to me.

39:04.376 --> 39:06.343
No.

39:06.378 --> 39:08.012
What we did.

39:08.047 --> 39:09.446
No.

39:09.481 --> 39:12.382
No, like, what you did to me.

39:12.418 --> 39:14.284
Come on.

39:14.320 --> 39:16.320
We both know that your mother
was into some weird stuff

39:16.355 --> 39:18.388
with that "experimental"
couples therapy.

39:18.424 --> 39:19.090
You came in and saw us.

39:19.125 --> 39:22.859
- You were watching.
- N...

39:22.894 --> 39:25.829
- You followed me into my bedroom.
- No.

39:25.864 --> 39:28.298
I went to the bathroom and you
were waiting in the hallway.

39:28.334 --> 39:29.666
That is not true.

39:29.702 --> 39:31.301
I asked you if you were curious.
You said yes.

39:32.671 --> 39:35.071
I was 12.

39:35.107 --> 39:36.639
What?

39:36.674 --> 39:39.508
N... That's not possible.
You said you were 17.

39:39.544 --> 39:40.977
I lied.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.017
If I say yes,

39:48.053 --> 39:50.686
you'll bring me more?

39:53.124 --> 39:54.823
Yes.

40:01.999 --> 40:04.300
You're sorry?

40:04.335 --> 40:07.470
Is that supposed to make me
feel better or forgive you?

40:07.505 --> 40:10.038
Because I... you know, I don't.

40:12.409 --> 40:15.310
You ever even think about
what you did to me?

40:15.345 --> 40:18.881
Every time I look in the mirror.

40:20.751 --> 40:22.117
Your father came that night...

40:22.153 --> 40:24.119
My what?

40:24.155 --> 40:26.220
My father never even knew
about what happened.

40:26.256 --> 40:27.922
Of course he did.

40:27.957 --> 40:29.591
He came that night,
and he beat the crap out of me.

40:29.626 --> 40:30.925
What are you talking about?

40:30.960 --> 40:34.462
That's just not possible.

40:34.498 --> 40:36.431
It's not. Because if my father knew,

40:36.466 --> 40:38.433
he would've said something to me.

40:41.237 --> 40:43.370
If my father knew...

40:48.377 --> 40:50.311
God, I'm sorry.

41:06.761 --> 41:08.695
You're scaring
the hell out of me, Rachel.

41:08.730 --> 41:11.364
Where are you?
