03:39.600 --> 03:42.300
When we started rescuing dogs
15 years ago,

03:42.300 --> 03:46.467
I never dreamed
we would have a real rescue.

03:46.467 --> 03:49.333
And I never dreamed we would
have a rescue this size

03:49.333 --> 03:53.767
that has taken over, you know,
our whole home, our lives.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.500

04:15.200 --> 04:17.166
Want me to bring you lunch,
old guy?

04:17.166 --> 04:19.399
Most people who rescue dogs

04:19.399 --> 04:22.333
have kennels separate
from their houses,

04:22.333 --> 04:24.533
but we'd saved so many animals

04:24.533 --> 04:28.267
that had been victimized
or injured.

04:28.267 --> 04:31.333
And we don't always know what
we're getting into with that.

04:31.333 --> 04:34.167
And that's why living with them
sometimes is so important

04:34.167 --> 04:36.667
'cause we really find out
what we need to know

04:36.667 --> 04:39.100
before they get adopted
by someone.

04:39.100 --> 04:41.333
What happens sometimes is--
yes, it is.

04:41.333 --> 04:43.267
We've told you
this story before.

04:43.267 --> 04:45.367
We've told you a lot.

04:45.367 --> 04:49.600
She was going stir-crazy being
in the shelter for too long.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.267
We'd have felt terrible
if we made her stay

04:51.267 --> 04:53.700

for another week, even.

04:53.700 --> 04:56.267
So, it's gonna work out
for this sweetheart,

04:56.267 --> 04:58.233
I can promise you that.

04:58.233 --> 05:00.300
I remember how excited when we hit

05:00.300 --> 05:02.267
the 1,000th adoption.

05:02.267 --> 05:04.600
Danny and I thought
we hit the lottery, you know?

05:04.600 --> 05:06.533
We were like, "Can you believe
we made it to a thousand?"

05:06.533 --> 05:07.667
Okay, family walk...

05:07.667 --> 05:09.200
And right now, I mean,

05:09.200 --> 05:11.133
we're only a hundred
and a few dogs away

05:11.133 --> 05:13.067

the 10,000th adoption.

05:13.067 --> 05:15.133
Let's go.
Come on.

05:15.133 --> 05:18.133
- Boys, come on.
- Come on. Come on.

05:22.500 --> 05:25.633
Hi, guys. Hi.

05:25.633 --> 05:27.533
How are you guys, huh?

05:27.533 --> 05:28.533
Doggies.

05:29.767 --> 05:30.767
Doggies, hi.

05:35.533 --> 05:40.367
<i>We get the majority of our</i>
<i>dogs from animal shelters.</i>

05:40.367 --> 05:43.467
<i>A lot of the shelters have</i>

05:43.467 --> 05:46.733
<i>what they call "red code day,"</i>
<i>which is euthanasia day.</i>

05:46.733 --> 05:50.600
<i>Sometimes I can get 100 e-mails</i>
<i>from 20 shelters</i>

05:50.600 --> 05:54.067
asking us to take dogs off
their euthanasia list.

05:54.067 --> 05:58.400
This is just one normal e-mail
from one shelter.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.633
These are all,
as you can see, it says,

06:00.633 --> 06:03.233
"final date," "expired,"
"critical."

06:03.233 --> 06:08.333
So these animals are about
to be euthanized today.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.367
Over 4 million animals
are euthanized

06:10.367 --> 06:12.267
every year in America.

06:12.267 --> 06:14.133
It's very, very sad.

06:14.133 --> 06:17.267
You look at their faces,
you look at their eyes,

06:17.267 --> 06:20.267
and they're just begging
for someone to save 'em.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.533
Hello.

06:42.533 --> 06:44.300
That's a pretty color.

06:44.300 --> 06:46.367
Yeah, she's beautiful.

06:51.133 --> 06:53.700
This little guy here.

06:53.700 --> 06:55.633
That's the one
we're checking on.

06:55.633 --> 06:58.033
She's very sweet.
Housebroken.

06:58.033 --> 07:02.033
A lady got her off Facebook
and she didn't want her anymore.

07:02.033 --> 07:04.400
This one came from a hoarder
and he still needs some work.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.133
- Okay.
- They came in really, really, really, really shy.

07:07.133 --> 07:08.767
We've got three left.
They're probably

07:08.767 --> 07:11.767
the nicest-looking hoarding dogs
I've ever seen.

07:11.767 --> 07:13.667
- And there's Chester.
- You are cute.

07:13.667 --> 07:16.467
- He's a rat terrier mix.
- Hey, Chester. And how old is he?

07:16.467 --> 07:19.167
He's about four years old.
He came in as a stray.

07:19.167 --> 07:21.300
Is he pretty settled,
though, normally, or...?

07:21.300 --> 07:23.000
He usually is, yes.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.500
He's been outside,
so he's all hyped up.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.167
He's been runnin'
in the yard.

07:26.167 --> 07:30.000
<i>It's hard to pick up dogs that are on euthanasia</i>

07:30.000 --> 07:33.533
<i>because you already know</i>
<i>they don't really have a chance</i>

07:33.533 --> 07:35.600
<i>I will ask them if they can</i>
<i>give me any description</i>

07:35.600 --> 07:37.600
<i>on their personality, if they're friendly,</i>
<i>if they're aggressive,</i>

07:37.600 --> 07:39.533
<i>if they're dog-aggressive,</i>
<i>cat-aggressive.</i>

07:39.533 --> 07:42.233
<i>And, I mean, we don't want</i>
<i>to pick the perfect dog.</i>

07:42.233 --> 07:45.367
<i>We want to pick a dog that we can help and save and hopefully rehab.</i>

07:46.733 --> 07:49.000
As you can see,
this one is active.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.433
- And it's black, so it's gonna be kind of hard for us.
- Right, right.

07:51.433 --> 07:53.400
So, maybe,
maybe that would be one.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.000
We don't need another one that's hyper right now.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
We've got about four
of those.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.767
Let's look, now.

07:59.767 --> 08:02.333
<i>Shelters, by law,</i>

08:02.333 --> 08:05.433
<i>they have to take every animal</i>
<i>dropped off here.</i>

08:05.433 --> 08:11.367
We receive 5,000 animals a year
at our animal shelter.

08:11.367 --> 08:14.000
<i>We can hold 125.</i>

08:14.000 --> 08:18.267
<i>If we're overloaded,</i>
<i>then we have to make room.</i>

08:18.267 --> 08:22.233
He came in, in a trap,
through Animal Control.

08:22.233 --> 08:25.100
They'd said that he was mean
and vicious

08:25.100 --> 08:27.467
and to be careful 'cause
he would eat us for lunch.

08:27.467 --> 08:31.533
Well, ahem... here he is.
- Doesn't look it.

08:31.533 --> 08:36.200
<i>Seeing their faces and knowing</i>
<i>they're going to die...</i>

08:36.200 --> 08:40.700
<i>that drives me harder</i>
<i>to want to save more.</i>

08:40.700 --> 08:46.533
I don't think I could ever
turn my back on this

08:46.533 --> 08:48.333
'cause I couldn't live
with the guilt

08:48.333 --> 08:52.000
of walking away from all
those faces that need help.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.233
He needs a really good,
special home.

08:54.233 --> 08:57.033
- Someone that's gonna take care of him.
- Do you wanna go home, hmm?

08:57.033 --> 09:00.233
<i>It's a funny emotion because there's a part of me</i>

09:00.233 --> 09:03.067
<i>that would love</i>
<i>to be selfish and say,</i>

09:03.067 --> 09:05.533
"We've rescued
almost 10,000 dogs.

09:05.533 --> 09:07.600
"We're gonna go pick up.
We're gonna go travel.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.033
"We're gonna go live
the rest of our life

09:10.033 --> 09:12.267
and have a good life,"

09:12.267 --> 09:17.200
but my internal insides
won't let me do it.

09:19.367 --> 09:21.067
This is Apollo.

09:21.067 --> 09:23.300
He was runnin' on the side
of the road, stray.

09:23.300 --> 09:25.100
He's been very friendly.

09:25.100 --> 09:30.000
He was injured as a puppy,
um, so he does have a bum leg,

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
so we've had no interest
in him whatsoever.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.100
Apollo, do you want
to go home, huh?

09:35.100 --> 09:37.733
You wanna go home
and get out of here?

09:37.733 --> 09:41.100
The ones that are very friendly,
very cute, furry,

09:41.100 --> 09:42.733
those get adopted immediately.

09:42.733 --> 09:45.067
What we usually try to do
is try to get a lot

09:45.067 --> 09:49.633
that are not very popular
to get adopted,

09:49.633 --> 09:52.167
so that they can get
a home.

09:52.167 --> 09:53.500
And that's Moose.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.533
We'll get you
ice creamies.

09:55.533 --> 09:57.667
- I think this dog has...
- Yeah, come on.

09:57.667 --> 10:00.300
...basset, Pekingese,
cocker spaniel...

10:00.300 --> 10:03.433
...golden retriever, setter...
- Come on.

10:03.433 --> 10:05.500
- Huh?
...and a little chow.

10:05.500 --> 10:08.167
Not to mention bloodhound
and Afghan and...

10:08.167 --> 10:10.133
- Well, look at the coat.
- That's beautiful.

10:10.133 --> 10:12.267
It's got the coat
of an Akita.

10:12.267 --> 10:13.633
Let's put Akita
in there, too.

10:13.633 --> 10:16.200
- Look at it.
- Oh, it's beautiful.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.567
You look like a loaf
of bread.

10:17.567 --> 10:19.333
Watch it-- watch it run
now. Come on, Moose.

10:19.333 --> 10:20.400
- It's just a rectangle.
- Moosey!

10:20.400 --> 10:23.100
Is that not the cutest thing you've ever seen in your life?
- That is precious.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.500
- It's not but eight weeks old.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.000
Moose!

10:27.000 --> 10:29.700
Looks like a cocktail table.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.200
<i>Not everyone's born</i>

10:31.200 --> 10:34.367
<i>with the very same gifts</i>
<i>and the same luck.</i>

10:34.367 --> 10:36.433
<i>Because of that,</i>
<i>they have to have</i>

10:36.433 --> 10:39.100
<i>a little extra help,</i>
<i>and I think that ideology</i>

10:39.100 --> 10:41.633
<i>has gone with me</i>
<i>through my entire life.</i>

10:41.633 --> 10:43.733
You need some skin work,
don't ya, huh?

10:43.733 --> 10:46.467
<i>Growing up, my mom always said,</i>

10:46.467 --> 10:49.333
<i>"Don't buy a dog.</i>
<i>Let's save a dog."</i>

10:49.333 --> 10:51.600
<i>I remember when I really wanted</i>
<i>a Dalmatian.</i>

10:51.600 --> 10:54.000
<i>Mom said, "There's always people</i>
<i>for those,</i>

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
<i>"but there's not people to take</i>
<i>the animals from shelters</i>

10:57.000 --> 10:58.733
<i>where so many</i>
<i>will be euthanized,"</i>

10:58.733 --> 11:01.267
<i>and that's where we went.</i>

11:01.267 --> 11:03.633
<i>I'd always pick the one</i>
<i>with the saddest eyes.</i>

11:03.633 --> 11:07.467
They were wormy,
they were skinny...

11:07.467 --> 11:10.500
and something about the eyes
is what always sold 'em on me.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.500
<i>They'd look at me</i>
<i>in some sort of way</i>

11:12.500 --> 11:14.333
<i>and that's the one</i>
<i>I'd have to have.</i>

11:14.333 --> 11:16.467
This is Lily.
She's super sweet.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.700
I mean, super,
super sweet.

11:18.700 --> 11:21.000
I mean,
the problem we run into sometimes

11:21.000 --> 11:23.500
is when so many look
just the same.

11:23.500 --> 11:26.333
They're nondescript breeds
of brown and black,

11:26.333 --> 11:29.467
and it's hard to get people
to feel enticed by them.

11:29.467 --> 11:32.000
- It is. You're absolutely right.
- That's the hard part.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.333
I think she's heartworm-positive,

11:33.333 --> 11:35.700
but I'm not positive
about that.

11:35.700 --> 11:36.633
- Says it up there.
- Low positive.

11:36.633 --> 11:38.200
Heartworm positive!

11:38.200 --> 11:41.000
Heartworms actually live in the heart of a dog.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.167
They're transmitted
by mosquitoes.

11:43.167 --> 11:45.500
But people don't want
heartworm-positive dogs

11:45.500 --> 11:47.633
because they're expensive
to treat.

11:47.633 --> 11:50.233
We do 30 days of doxycycline.

11:50.233 --> 11:52.667
Then they have to stay
totally quiet for 30 days

11:52.667 --> 11:56.033
because when they get excited,
the dog can have a heart attack.

11:56.033 --> 11:58.600
The next 30 days,
they get two more injections,

11:58.600 --> 12:01.000
and then we keep 'em quiet
for another 30 days.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.333
But, you know,

12:02.333 --> 12:05.167
a heartworm preventative,
it's such a simple thing.

12:05.167 --> 12:07.033
I mean, one pill a month,

12:07.033 --> 12:09.000
your dog will not have
heartworm disease.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.733
Look at her face,
just how she looks you in the eyes.

12:11.733 --> 12:14.500
Look at her.
Like, she's staring at you right now just like...

12:14.500 --> 12:16.433
Putting her nose
right on the glass.

12:16.433 --> 12:19.433
Oh, they know how to pull
at your heartstrings.

12:19.433 --> 12:21.533
Lily, I wanna go home, huh?
Get you treated for--

12:21.533 --> 12:25.267
Oh, yes, you do. Get you treated for heartworms, huh?
- It's a deal.

12:25.267 --> 12:27.367
You wanna shake
on the deal?

12:27.367 --> 12:30.067
<i>I think Danny and I both were born</i>

12:30.067 --> 12:32.367
<i>with a true compassion</i>
<i>for animals.</i>

12:32.367 --> 12:34.433
<i>When I was a little kid,</i>

12:34.433 --> 12:36.133
<i>even though I wanted</i>
<i>to go fishing,</i>

12:36.133 --> 12:37.700
I never wanted
to put the worm on the hook

12:37.700 --> 12:39.467
'cause I felt sorry
for the worm

12:39.467 --> 12:41.667
getting the hook, you know,
zigzagged through it.

12:41.667 --> 12:45.733
<i>I was saving animals as far back as I can remember.</i>

12:45.733 --> 12:48.467
<i>When I walked home from school,</i>
<i>kind of the bigger,</i>

12:48.467 --> 12:51.033
<i>gruffer guys that were</i>
<i>a little scary to me,</i>

12:51.033 --> 12:52.700
sometimes they'd catch a turtle

12:52.700 --> 12:55.567
and then they'd just knife
its head off just for fun.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.367
<i>And even though I was</i>
<i>sort of scared of the guys,</i>

12:57.367 --> 12:59.600
<i>I'd make deals with them</i>
<i>and give them whatever I had</i>

12:59.600 --> 13:02.400
<i>to take the turtle</i>
<i>so they didn't kill it.</i>

13:02.400 --> 13:06.100
<i>I used to rescue baby robins that fell out of trees.</i>

13:06.100 --> 13:08.167
<i>We used to nurture 'em back</i>
<i>and then try to put 'em</i>

13:08.167 --> 13:10.033
<i>on our finger</i>
<i>and teach 'em how to fly.</i>

13:10.033 --> 13:14.433
<i>And horses and frogs and mice,</i>
<i>turtles in the road.</i>

13:14.433 --> 13:17.033
I mean, there-- if I see
a turtle crossing a road,

13:17.033 --> 13:19.500
you know, everybody better stop,
'cause I get out of the car

13:19.500 --> 13:21.133
and I help the turtle
cross the road.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.400
I had a rooster we got
from the Tote-Em-In Zoo

13:23.400 --> 13:25.533
because he was
in the lion's cage

13:25.533 --> 13:28.367
and the lion had
already broken his wing.

13:28.367 --> 13:30.600
And I pitched such a fit
that they ended up

13:30.600 --> 13:34.233
getting the rooster with a net
and bringing him out of the cage

13:34.233 --> 13:37.500
and then I took him
and, uh, helped heal him.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.333
So...

13:39.333 --> 13:43.267
♪♪

13:58.100 --> 13:59.700
Go, sweetie.

13:59.700 --> 14:02.033
Whew!
Let's go on in.

14:04.033 --> 14:07.633
All right, gang, meet Lily.
Hi, Lily.

14:07.633 --> 14:09.233
Lily, you're gonna get
a nice bath

14:09.233 --> 14:12.367
and get nice and clean
for us, okay?

14:12.367 --> 14:16.567
♪♪

14:16.567 --> 14:19.467
All right, sorry about that.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.167
All right, here we go.
All right.

14:28.267 --> 14:31.333
Look at you, Apollo.
I'm so proud of you.

14:39.167 --> 14:41.467
Good boy!

14:41.467 --> 14:43.533
Think she's gonna
fall asleep on us.

14:45.533 --> 14:47.167
Lily, you wanna be
wheeled out?

14:47.167 --> 14:49.067
Is that what you want?

14:49.067 --> 14:50.300
Huh?
You wanna be wheeled out?

14:50.300 --> 14:52.067
- Or you wanna walk out?
- All right.

14:52.067 --> 14:53.633
Think we can walk out, sweetie?
Come on.

14:53.633 --> 14:56.000
There you go.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.600
We got a new
family member, guys.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.667
Back up, Busy Bee.
Come on, Lily.

14:59.667 --> 15:01.600
You'll be all right.
Okay.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.633
This is part
of your new pack.

15:03.633 --> 15:05.667
This is part
of your new family, huh?

15:05.667 --> 15:08.100
Hey! Lily, stop.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.433
Stop, Lily.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.167
Might not be going
so well.

15:14.167 --> 15:16.567
Lily.

15:19.333 --> 15:22.333
No. No.
That's a no.

15:22.333 --> 15:25.633
Hi, guys.
Hi, hi.

15:28.533 --> 15:31.033
Okay, Lily.
Okay, Lily.

15:33.467 --> 15:36.567
She'll wear the muzzle for probably just a few more minutes.

15:36.567 --> 15:39.700
It's soft rubber.
It's totally humane.

15:39.700 --> 15:42.500
They can eat, they can drink,
but the only thing is,

15:42.500 --> 15:44.500
it keeps the rest
of our pack safe

15:44.500 --> 15:46.700
until she learns
social skills.

15:46.700 --> 15:49.367
We'll just keep doing this,
you know, ten times a day,

15:49.367 --> 15:51.267
just interacting her
with the pack.

15:51.267 --> 15:54.133
In a day or two, she'll probably
be running right with the pack.

15:54.133 --> 15:55.533
Yes, you're doing good, Lily.

15:55.533 --> 15:58.167
Buster Brown likes you, yes.

15:58.167 --> 16:02.100
Blanche, what do you think, huh?
What do you think, Blanche, huh?

16:02.100 --> 16:04.733
All right, little Moose,
meet the big world.

16:09.133 --> 16:10.633
Oh, I don't know
about Amelia.

16:10.633 --> 16:13.700
That's the grumpiest one
you're gonna encounter.

16:13.700 --> 16:16.233
Hi, Amelia.
This-- you be the sweetest.

16:16.233 --> 16:19.467
Wanna get down?
Wanna get down?

16:19.467 --> 16:22.267
Who are the other guys, huh?

16:22.267 --> 16:24.767
Oh, you're gonna meet
Amelia first?

16:24.767 --> 16:27.500
Oh, my gosh,
that's risky.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.700
Look how good you're being.

16:29.700 --> 16:31.633
Well, who's that coming?

16:31.633 --> 16:33.200
Hey.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.400
Look at that one, huh?

16:35.400 --> 16:37.667
Who could that be?

16:37.667 --> 16:40.167
Hmm?

16:40.167 --> 16:41.533
Where you going?

16:43.567 --> 16:46.733
He's not very interested in me.
That's a nice thing.

16:46.733 --> 16:48.633
At least that shows
a little independence.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.600
A lot of times, they just want
to sit on my lap

16:50.600 --> 16:53.233
and stay there forever.

16:53.233 --> 16:55.300
Hey, Moose.

16:55.300 --> 16:57.433
Moose.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.067
Come on back.

16:59.067 --> 17:00.600
Tell 'em about yourself.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.600
Tell them what your name is,
where you came from.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.599
Tell 'em everything about you.

17:05.599 --> 17:08.500
What you want to be
when you grow up, huh?

17:08.500 --> 17:10.000
Wanna tell them?
Look.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.067
He looks very interested.

17:12.067 --> 17:13.400
Look.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.166
Sammy is very interested
in your future.

17:16.166 --> 17:19.099
Look at this.
Cotton's coming to see you.

17:19.099 --> 17:20.733
Mr. Cotton and Lester.

17:20.733 --> 17:23.032
You know,
Cotton could teach you a lot.

17:23.032 --> 17:26.267
Cotton's a special
little man here.

17:26.267 --> 17:28.733
He has to stay
a permanent resident here.

17:28.733 --> 17:33.500
I don't-- I don't think
he could truly take

17:33.500 --> 17:35.567
a change in his life now.

17:35.567 --> 17:39.467
He was taken to the shelter
one day, when Ron was there,

17:39.467 --> 17:42.467
with a diaper wrapped
around him.

17:42.467 --> 17:44.500
And, truthfully,
the lady said,

17:44.500 --> 17:46.233
"I wanna get rid
of this damn dog,

17:46.233 --> 17:49.067
and I don't want no more worms
on my porch,"

17:49.067 --> 17:51.767
and, uh, she wanted him
put to sleep.

17:51.767 --> 17:56.233
He was totally frightened,
and, um...

17:56.233 --> 17:58.500
he didn't wanna eat for days.

17:58.500 --> 17:59.733
And when he'd go out
in the yard,

17:59.733 --> 18:01.267
it would take three
or four of us

18:01.267 --> 18:03.000
just to keep walking around,
walking around,

18:03.000 --> 18:04.200
to get him to come
in the house.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.400
And now he's friends
with everybody.

18:06.400 --> 18:09.633
And out in the yard now,
he comes to you.

18:09.633 --> 18:11.667
And that's one
of the biggest secrets

18:11.667 --> 18:14.400
about so many
of these scared ones.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.100
You just give them the time
and then they come to you

18:17.100 --> 18:19.133
and tell you
their terms of life,

18:19.133 --> 18:21.700
and you try to merger the two

18:21.700 --> 18:25.300
and see if you
can get somewhere.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.400
Hey, Moose.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.067
Puppies learn
to adjust quickly.

18:30.067 --> 18:33.267
He's gonna be
a very s-secure puppy.

18:33.267 --> 18:35.633
You're gonna be pretty secure,
aren't ya?

18:35.633 --> 18:38.167
You're gonna do it all right.
Hmm?

18:38.167 --> 18:41.167
Life's gonna be great for you.
Yes, it is.

18:41.167 --> 18:44.000
Life is gonna
treat you fine, huh?

18:44.000 --> 18:45.467
Life will treat you fine.

18:45.467 --> 18:47.767
You'll get some human
and you'll train 'em.

18:47.767 --> 18:51.667
You'll train 'em right away
and tell them who's boss, right?

18:51.667 --> 18:54.400
Who's boss, yes?
Rub the big belly.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.033
Rub the big belly
and make sure you feed it,

18:57.033 --> 18:59.633
and then it's gonna be
a perfect life.

18:59.633 --> 19:01.667
Hmm?

19:01.667 --> 19:04.267
<i>Long before we were a rescue</i>
<i>and had dreams</i>

19:04.267 --> 19:07.300
<i>or even thoughts</i>
<i>of becoming an actual rescue,</i>

19:07.300 --> 19:09.067
<i>I'd go to shelters.</i>

19:09.067 --> 19:11.267
<i>See animals that just looked</i>
<i>a little sad,</i>

19:11.267 --> 19:14.467
<i>a little neglected,</i>
<i>and always take one or two</i>

19:14.467 --> 19:16.700
<i>and then make sure they get</i>
<i>to a good place.</i>

19:16.700 --> 19:18.500
We didn't see ourselves
as a rescue.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.533
We saw ourselves
as rescuers.

19:20.533 --> 19:23.333
We probably did that
for 15 or 20 years,

19:23.333 --> 19:25.633
just 25 or 50 a year,

19:25.633 --> 19:28.533
and didn't really think much
beyond that.

19:28.533 --> 19:33.133
But in August of 2005
was probably the-- the catalyst

19:33.133 --> 19:36.367
that turned us into something a little different than what we'd been.

19:36.367 --> 19:39.500
<i>We're in storm alert mode right now as Katrina,</i>

19:39.500 --> 19:41.700
<i>one of the most powerful</i>
<i>hurricanes we've seen</i>

19:41.700 --> 19:44.467
<i>in several decades,</i>
<i>threatens the Gulf Coast.</i>

19:44.467 --> 19:48.500
<i>This is what everyone feared.</i>
<i>The storm surge.</i>

19:48.500 --> 19:52.667
<i>Two of the levees that
held back Lake Pontchartrain have cracked.</i>

19:52.667 --> 19:57.133
<i>80 % of New Orleans is now underwater.</i>

19:57.133 --> 20:01.100
<i>Families are being plucked from what FEMA now calls</i>

20:01.100 --> 20:03.533
<i>the most significant</i>
<i>natural disaster</i>

20:03.533 --> 20:05.533
<i>ever to hit</i>
<i>the United States.</i>

20:06.167 --> 20:11.000
When Hurricane Katrina hit,
our first instinct, um,

20:11.000 --> 20:12.533
is we wanted to help people.

20:12.533 --> 20:15.500
We happened to be in Florida
at that time,

20:15.500 --> 20:18.500
and we heard on the local news
that they were moving

20:18.500 --> 20:21.000
300-and-some people
from New Orleans

20:21.000 --> 20:25.333
to the racetrack in Boca,
and they didn't have anything.

20:26.167 --> 20:32.000
We bought toothpaste, toothbrushes, clothes, socks, brushes, coffeepots,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.567
anything we could think of,
so people would, you know,

20:34.567 --> 20:36.100
have something to their name.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Then, all of a sudden,
you know,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.767
we started seeing pictures
of the dogs.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
<i>It's been like this for weeks now.</i>

20:45.000 --> 20:48.300
<i>Dogs stranded in trees,</i>
<i>dogs stranded on walls,</i>

20:48.300 --> 20:50.433
<i>pacing, surrounded by water.</i>

20:50.433 --> 20:54.167
<i>Abandoned by their owners,</i>
<i>alive or dead.</i>

20:54.167 --> 20:57.000
<i>No one was allowed to take a dog when they were rescued.</i>

20:57.000 --> 20:59.300
<i>They had to leave</i>
<i>all their pets behind.</i>

20:59.300 --> 21:01.133
<i>Some wouldn't leave them.</i>

21:01.133 --> 21:04.167
A couple dogs were found on a dining room table floating in the house,

21:04.167 --> 21:06.233
and the lady
that owned them had died.

21:06.233 --> 21:08.000
She wouldn't leave
her animals,

21:08.000 --> 21:11.333
but she drowned,
and the dogs were caught,

21:11.333 --> 21:13.767
like, with a canoe or something
at that point.

21:13.767 --> 21:16.000
<i>The sad thing was,</i>
<i>a lot of these animals</i>

21:16.000 --> 21:19.167
<i>were all put in these cages,</i>
<i>crates, airline carriers,</i>

21:19.167 --> 21:21.467
<i>and they were all stored</i>
<i>in warehouses.</i>

21:21.467 --> 21:25.000
<i>Most of these dogs hadn't even</i>
<i>been out of the crates</i>

21:25.000 --> 21:26.333
<i>in the time they were caught,</i>

21:26.333 --> 21:28.767
<i>because they didn't have</i>
<i>the staff.</i>

21:28.767 --> 21:30.500
<i>We kind of</i>
<i>jumped in and decided</i>

21:30.500 --> 21:32.500
to start helping some
of these dogs.

21:34.433 --> 21:36.400
<i>We'd send our</i>
<i>horse trailer down.</i>

21:36.400 --> 21:38.433
<i>We'd make sure that it was</i>
<i>full of supplies--</i>

21:38.433 --> 21:41.667
<i>dog food, blankets,</i>
<i>leashes, collars.</i>

21:41.667 --> 21:43.733
<i>Trailer would turn around</i>
<i>and then bring us dogs</i>

21:43.733 --> 21:46.000
<i>back here</i>
<i>to South Carolina.</i>

21:46.000 --> 21:49.367
<i>We were not set up</i>
<i>to be a dog rescue.</i>

21:49.367 --> 21:52.267
<i>I mean, we had my barn here.</i>

21:52.267 --> 21:54.200
<i>We cleared all those</i>
<i>horse stalls out,</i>

21:54.200 --> 21:56.433
<i>and those were full of dogs.</i>

21:56.433 --> 21:58.600
<i>We made makeshift pens.</i>

21:58.600 --> 22:01.333
<i>We just made whatever means</i>
<i>we could.</i>

22:01.333 --> 22:03.133
When we would get the crates
and stuff, you know,

22:03.133 --> 22:05.467
they were wallowing
in feces and urine.

22:05.467 --> 22:09.667
<i>It was a tough thing to bathe</i>
<i>them all and get them healthy.</i>

22:09.667 --> 22:11.367
<i>They all had to be spayed</i>
<i>and neutered.</i>

22:11.367 --> 22:15.700
<i>And I would say probably 98 %</i>
<i>were heartworm-positive.</i>

22:15.700 --> 22:17.600
<i>We were just adopting dogs</i>

22:17.600 --> 22:20.067
<i>to friends</i>
<i>in the horse business.</i>

22:20.067 --> 22:22.167
<i>Within a five-month period,</i>

22:22.167 --> 22:27.333
we saved approximately 600 dogs
from Hurricane Katrina.

22:38.267 --> 22:40.033
- Hey, Ron.
- How are you?

22:40.033 --> 22:41.433
- We're good.
- Look at Nutmeg!

22:41.433 --> 22:43.467
- Here's Nutmeg.
- The perfect girl!

22:43.467 --> 22:45.067
- She is.
- Nutmeg!

22:45.067 --> 22:46.767
Lookie, Nutmeg!

22:46.767 --> 22:49.133
I have to say hi
to Nutmeg first.

22:49.133 --> 22:52.033
Hi, Nutmeg.
How are you, sweetie pie?

22:52.033 --> 22:54.533
How are you?
Are you still perfect?

22:54.533 --> 22:56.467
- How are you Logan, huh?
- Good.

22:56.467 --> 22:57.733
Are you excited about
your kitty?

22:57.733 --> 22:59.567
- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi, Holly.

22:59.567 --> 23:01.533
I can't believe it's been 11 years.

23:01.533 --> 23:03.167
Has it been that long, seriously?

23:03.167 --> 23:05.333
It'll be this fall that we've had her for 11 years.

23:05.333 --> 23:07.500
- Oh, my goodness.
- Holly was saying she can still remember you carrying her

23:07.500 --> 23:09.000
through the halls.
- Oh, yeah.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.633
You called me and said,
"Your new baby's here!"

23:11.633 --> 23:13.167
And you came walking down
the barn aisle

23:13.167 --> 23:15.133
with beautiful Nutmeg.

23:15.133 --> 23:17.067
With a totally black face.

23:17.067 --> 23:20.033
Holly's biggest thing was
it has to be friendly and loving

23:20.033 --> 23:21.533
and sweet and, you know,
all that sort of thing.

23:21.533 --> 23:23.167
- Right.
- And that's all we could test of--

23:23.167 --> 23:25.200
Wasn't that right, girl?
Oh, my God,

23:25.200 --> 23:26.333
she was just full of love.

23:26.333 --> 23:28.767
She's just pretty perfect.

23:28.767 --> 23:31.000
I think most of our friends thought,

23:31.000 --> 23:34.767
when Katrina's over,
you know, shoo, the end.

23:34.767 --> 23:38.100
"Danny and Ron aren't gonna bother us anymore about adopting dogs."

23:38.100 --> 23:41.300
Logan, come look at these
cutie-patootie puppies here.

23:41.300 --> 23:44.733
But the Katrina experience changed us.

23:44.733 --> 23:47.533
We got to see the volume
of animals in need.

23:47.533 --> 23:49.233
I mean, we always knew
there was volume

23:49.233 --> 23:51.167
of animals in needs
in shelters,

23:51.167 --> 23:54.167
but to think
of all the homeless pets,

23:54.167 --> 23:56.667
I mean,
it was a big impact on us.

23:56.667 --> 23:58.433
That's what actually gave us

23:58.433 --> 24:01.700
even more energy
to become a major rescue.

24:01.700 --> 24:04.267
Their mother was
a cocker spaniel,

24:04.267 --> 24:07.100
and the owners moved
and took the mother dog

24:07.100 --> 24:09.000
and left nine puppies
out in the yard

24:09.000 --> 24:11.467
to survive
with no food and water.

24:11.467 --> 24:14.033
<i>A friend of mine, she said, "Okay,
you boys need to come up</i>

24:14.033 --> 24:16.000
<i>with a name for your rescue."</i>

24:16.000 --> 24:18.267
She said, "Why don't you just do
Danny & Ron's Rescue?"

24:18.267 --> 24:20.300
She said, "Everybody knows Danny
and Ron in the horse business.

24:20.300 --> 24:22.133
Let's just do it simple like that."
Which I hated,

24:22.133 --> 24:24.633
but I couldn't think of anything else at the time.

24:24.633 --> 24:26.333
- Here, you wanna hold her?
- Hold her.

24:26.333 --> 24:28.267
I never came up with another name, really.

24:28.267 --> 24:30.133
I had stopped thinking
about it.

24:30.133 --> 24:32.200
But I hear catchy
little phrases sometimes

24:32.200 --> 24:34.633
of names that sound great,
but now that I've heard

24:34.633 --> 24:38.700
so many play on words
with the-the, you know,

24:38.700 --> 24:41.267
the paws and the claws
and the snip and snap

24:41.267 --> 24:43.467
and the fairy tales,
I'm sort of glad

24:43.467 --> 24:45.600
we just have
our two names on it.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.533
Easy to remember.

24:47.533 --> 24:50.300
Oh, my gosh!

24:50.300 --> 24:53.533
Is that Jellybean?
Oh, good.

24:53.533 --> 24:56.067
- You guys saved a life.
- We did.

24:56.067 --> 24:58.200
By the way,
I know where there are three guinea pigs.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.600
Oh, don't even start.

25:01.733 --> 25:04.433
Wait, Mom, can I please hold her one more time?
One more time.

25:04.433 --> 25:06.700
Let me just get her in,
and then,

25:06.700 --> 25:09.133
when you get in the car,
you can hold her, okay?

25:09.133 --> 25:10.600
Okay.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.667
Okay, here we go.

25:12.667 --> 25:16.600
♪♪

25:35.400 --> 25:38.200
Brenda,
I am looking in my income tax thing

25:38.200 --> 25:40.500
in the file thing
because I'm gonna go try to do

25:40.500 --> 25:42.700
a home equity loan
for the rescue.

25:42.700 --> 25:46.600
2005, '06, '07, '08,
'09, '10, '11, '12.

25:46.600 --> 25:49.300
Where would '15 be?

25:49.300 --> 25:52.200
<i>Danny and I spent about 40 %</i>
<i>of his retirement fund</i>

25:52.200 --> 25:56.067
<i>and my retirement fund</i>
<i>taking the dogs from Katrina.</i>

25:56.067 --> 25:58.433
It got to the point, you know,
when the accountant said,

25:58.433 --> 26:00.733
"Look, you guys gotta stop this
because you're gonna have

26:00.733 --> 26:03.100
"nothing for retirement
and you're gonna be

26:03.100 --> 26:05.167
paying taxes on all of this."

26:05.167 --> 26:08.267
<i>Now, we are</i>
<i>a 501 nonprofit,</i>

26:08.267 --> 26:12.333
<i>but last year,</i>
<i>it cost nearly a million dollar</i>

26:12.333 --> 26:14.567
<i>to run this entire rescue.</i>

26:14.567 --> 26:16.733
I am going to try
to take a loan

26:16.733 --> 26:21.633
for the rescue out
in my name...

26:21.633 --> 26:26.033
'cause I don't think the rescue
has enough equity to get a loan,

26:26.033 --> 26:28.500
so I am going
to do it personally.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.533
I'm going to see

26:30.533 --> 26:35.233
if they will give us
a $100,000 loan.

26:35.233 --> 26:39.233
<i>One of the most strenuous parts</i>
<i>of the rescue for me</i>

26:39.233 --> 26:42.733
is constantly worry about where
the money's gonna come from,

26:42.733 --> 26:44.400
how the staff's gonna get paid,

26:44.400 --> 26:46.400
how we're gonna make it
to the next month.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.167
This one's '12.

26:48.167 --> 26:50.633
<i>We survive strictly</i>
<i>on donations.</i>

26:50.633 --> 26:52.567
<i>December's always</i>
<i>a good month for us</i>

26:52.567 --> 26:54.333
<i>because that's when donations</i>
<i>come in</i>

26:54.333 --> 26:56.433
<i>'cause people need</i>
<i>the tax write-off.</i>

26:56.433 --> 26:59.500
<i>But unfortunately,</i>
<i>we have a very long dry period</i>

26:59.500 --> 27:01.300
from the winter
to make it through.

27:01.300 --> 27:03.600
I mean, we get donations
during the year, but, you know,

27:03.600 --> 27:05.633
most of the time, they're just
very small donations,

27:05.633 --> 27:08.433
and as big of a rescue
as we are,

27:08.433 --> 27:11.167
it's not enough
to keep us afloat.

27:11.167 --> 27:14.067
- Elmer! Hi, Elmer.
- He is so sweet.

27:14.067 --> 27:16.133
- Look at Ron.
- Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy.

27:16.133 --> 27:18.400
Yeah,
he's a medical miracle.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.567
As you can see,
both sides of his mouth

27:20.567 --> 27:22.600
has been reconstructed there.
- Yeah.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.533
- And-- uh-huh.
- You had two surgeries, huh?

27:24.533 --> 27:26.667
Two surgeries, Elmer?
Hi.

27:26.667 --> 27:29.433
<i>We hit a lot of dry periods</i>

27:29.433 --> 27:32.100
<i>where we run out of money</i>
<i>and we have a lot of sick dogs,</i>

27:32.100 --> 27:35.300
<i>and so, I have</i>
<i>a lot of sleepless nights</i>

27:35.300 --> 27:38.467
<i>worrying about how</i>
<i>we're gonna stay afloat.</i>

27:38.467 --> 27:40.233
I mean, like, right now,
we're in a really--

27:40.233 --> 27:42.033
I mean, just to make payroll
next week,

27:42.033 --> 27:43.767
we're gonna have to put
our own money in.

27:52.333 --> 27:55.300
Hey, Andrea, do you remember
the dog that we took,

27:55.300 --> 27:58.333
full of fleas, ear infections,
full of ticks?

27:58.333 --> 28:00.467
You know,
skin is all bloody?

28:00.467 --> 28:04.267
Well, there's somebody
that sent a message to me

28:04.267 --> 28:07.700
and said, "You have my dog."

28:07.700 --> 28:10.400
I mean, I would be thrilled
to death if it was a great owner

28:10.400 --> 28:12.133
'cause it'd be one less dog
for me,

28:12.133 --> 28:13.500
but now that he's getting
good care,

28:13.500 --> 28:15.067
I have a very hard time

28:15.067 --> 28:18.333
turning him back over
to that situation.

28:18.333 --> 28:21.067
The rescue life very quickly,

28:21.067 --> 28:23.633
very easily can engulf
our whole life

28:23.633 --> 28:26.467
to where it's hard sometimes
to keep remembering

28:26.467 --> 28:29.167
that we have to earn a living
doing the horses.

28:33.600 --> 28:36.400
Good.
A little ride up.

28:36.400 --> 28:37.533
Easy.

28:37.533 --> 28:40.333
Think left.

28:40.333 --> 28:42.567
That's good for him,
Alaina.

28:42.567 --> 28:45.633
Very good.
Give him a pat.

28:45.633 --> 28:49.300
<i>We don't take a salary at all from the rescue.</i>

28:49.300 --> 28:51.167
<i>We never have.</i>

28:51.167 --> 28:53.000
<i>Danny and I train horses.</i>

28:53.000 --> 28:55.533
<i>That's how we make our living</i>
<i>and our livelihood.</i>

28:58.667 --> 29:00.533
Very nice. Good.

29:02.667 --> 29:08.233
<i>We met at a horse show in Aiken South Carolina,
in 1980.</i>

29:08.233 --> 29:09.700
<i>I was a professional</i>

29:09.700 --> 29:13.000
<i>moving from the Chicago area</i>
<i>to South Carolina,</i>

29:13.000 --> 29:16.633
<i>and Danny was a professional</i>
<i>here already.</i>

29:16.633 --> 29:19.467
<i>I rode his horses professionally,</i>

29:19.467 --> 29:23.433
<i>so we had a working relationship</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

29:23.433 --> 29:26.767
<i>I was married to a woman at that time.</i>

29:26.767 --> 29:29.500
<i>You know, in the generation</i>
<i>that I grew up in,</i>

29:29.500 --> 29:33.133
it was always a struggle,
where nowadays, you know,

29:33.133 --> 29:37.333
being gay is a lot more open
than it was back in the '80s.

29:37.333 --> 29:39.200
<i>I got married</i>
<i>'cause that was, like,</i>

29:39.200 --> 29:41.267
<i>what you were supposed to do</i>
<i>when you got out of college.</i>

29:41.267 --> 29:43.600
<i>You were supposed to get married</i>
<i>and have children.</i>

29:43.600 --> 29:46.333
<i>I was married for eight years</i>

29:46.333 --> 29:49.667
<i>and divorced in 1986.</i>

29:49.667 --> 29:52.700
The divorce came as big a shock
to, I guess, anybody.

29:52.700 --> 29:56.533
<i>Everyone around was sad</i>
<i>about that.</i>

29:56.533 --> 29:59.433
<i>And he was</i>
<i>particularly devastated.</i>

29:59.433 --> 30:01.500
I like what you went to.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.367
Have just a little more
in the back

30:03.367 --> 30:05.733
so you don't have to do it
near the jump.

30:05.733 --> 30:08.467
<i>Danny was one of my friends</i>

30:08.467 --> 30:11.600
<i>that really reached out</i>
<i>to be there for me.</i>

30:11.600 --> 30:14.600
<i>Seeing the emotional pain</i>
<i>that I was going through,</i>

30:14.600 --> 30:18.400
<i>he was a very warm,</i>
<i>compassionate person.</i>

30:18.400 --> 30:20.033
<i>I was a young person</i>

30:20.033 --> 30:23.200
<i>recently acknowledging</i>
<i>that I was gay.</i>

30:23.200 --> 30:24.767
<i>And we'd become closer friends</i>

30:24.767 --> 30:27.567
<i>and I was kind of his confidant</i>
<i>at that point.</i>

30:27.567 --> 30:30.100
Then finish with a three
to the three once more.

30:30.100 --> 30:31.767
<i>We became closer and closer</i>

30:31.767 --> 30:34.633
<i>and the relationship</i>
<i>just kept growing from there.</i>

30:34.633 --> 30:36.633
Ah, not you.
Sit.

30:36.633 --> 30:38.567
<i>After a couple years,</i>

30:38.567 --> 30:43.033
I moved over here, uh,
and I think that's probably when

30:43.033 --> 30:47.533
people actually began
to think of us as a couple.

30:47.533 --> 30:51.133
We have been together...

30:51.133 --> 30:55.200
'98, 2008...

30:55.200 --> 30:57.233
That's a long time ago to remember.

30:57.233 --> 30:59.400
- Um...
- Well, please tell me.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.033
'Cause anytime somebody asks me,

31:01.033 --> 31:02.733
I tell them a different number
every time.

31:02.733 --> 31:05.500
So it'd be like 27 years.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.367
This actually is good for Griz.

31:07.367 --> 31:10.467
Oh, it's wonderful for him.
He's gonna...

31:10.467 --> 31:12.333
He's gonna learn a lot
living here.

31:12.333 --> 31:16.000
<i>I think we were brought together for a reason,</i>

31:16.000 --> 31:20.667
but if Danny didn't have
the passion that I do

31:20.667 --> 31:24.467
for doing this,
there's no way it would happen.

31:24.467 --> 31:25.700
Hi, Tonto.

31:25.700 --> 31:27.133
<i>If I didn't have the passion</i>

31:27.133 --> 31:29.133
<i>that Danny has for it,</i>
<i>there's no way,</i>

31:29.133 --> 31:31.700
<i>or, like, if I didn't love dogs</i>
<i>the way I do, you know?</i>

31:31.700 --> 31:34.367
It takes two
for this to survive.

31:43.233 --> 31:45.767
<i>I think we both feel like</i>
<i>we've kind of lost our home</i>

31:45.767 --> 31:48.100
<i>because of the amount of dogs.</i>

31:48.100 --> 31:50.433
<i>Living in this type</i>
<i>of environment,</i>

31:50.433 --> 31:52.533
you know, there's many times
we've questioned ourselves

31:52.533 --> 31:54.467
what it would be like--

31:57.633 --> 32:01.500
Stop it!
Right now!

32:01.500 --> 32:03.667
- They don't listen to anybody else.
- That's not gonna stop 'em.

32:07.433 --> 32:12.633
<i>The house is approximately 4,400 square feet.</i>

32:12.633 --> 32:16.533
<i>People space?</i>

32:16.533 --> 32:18.567
How many square feet
would a king-size bed be?

32:18.567 --> 32:22.300
I mean, it's difficult to sleep.
You can't move.

32:22.300 --> 32:24.000
They nestle next
to your left side,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.200
your right side, your head,
they wrap on the pillow.

32:26.200 --> 32:28.067
And if you have to get up
to go to the bathroom,

32:28.067 --> 32:29.767
I mean, lots of luck
getting back in bed.

32:29.767 --> 32:32.700
I'm sort of wondering myself
how we lost the house.

32:32.700 --> 32:35.100
We used to have
a lot of people over

32:35.100 --> 32:36.733
and would have dinners.

32:36.733 --> 32:38.567
We ditched
the dining room mostly

32:38.567 --> 32:40.433
when we ended up having crates
all around it

32:40.433 --> 32:43.467
and you couldn't pull a chair
back in there anyway.

32:43.467 --> 32:47.600
Ron's a fantastic cook,
and he used to enjoy it.

32:47.600 --> 32:51.100
At one point, we even had
wedding parties here.

32:51.100 --> 32:54.233
Kitchen area we use a lot for socialization

32:54.233 --> 32:57.133
because it's
a very high-traffic area,

32:57.133 --> 33:00.000
so the dogs get
a lot of activity.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.700
We also had a fireplace.

33:02.700 --> 33:05.333
We don't burn fires
in it anymore.

33:05.333 --> 33:09.000
It's kind of like a big,
relaxing lounge area for them.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.033
Off the kitchen, we have the living room area,
where we're seated now.

33:12.033 --> 33:16.200
We used to have wood floors,
oriental carpets.

33:16.200 --> 33:18.667
It was very pretty, actually.

33:18.667 --> 33:21.533
But before you knew it,
carpets were being ripped,

33:21.533 --> 33:24.033
and, of course,
they were being peed on.

33:24.033 --> 33:26.233
So, up came the wooden floors.

33:26.233 --> 33:28.167
Here you come,
stone flooring.

33:28.167 --> 33:31.167
<i>The larger dogs live in the living room area.</i>

33:31.167 --> 33:33.233
<i>They have free run to come</i>
<i>and get on the furniture,</i>

33:33.233 --> 33:35.367
<i>wherever they want to lounge,</i>
<i>and they have a doggie door.</i>

33:35.367 --> 33:37.367
<i>They can go out</i>
<i>in the backyard.</i>

33:37.367 --> 33:39.600
<i>Off of the living room,</i>
<i>we have a front bedroom.</i>

33:39.600 --> 33:42.433
<i>In the front bedroom,</i>
<i>we strictly keep</i>

33:42.433 --> 33:44.200
<i>small litters of puppies.</i>

33:44.200 --> 33:46.600
If we really get jammed,
we use the shower stall

33:46.600 --> 33:50.200
in our bathroom
to put small puppies in.

33:50.200 --> 33:53.233
This used to be
a screen-enclosed porch.

33:53.233 --> 33:55.500
It had a Jacuzzi tub right here
in the middle

33:55.500 --> 33:58.133
that Danny and I
used to be able to relax in.

33:58.133 --> 34:00.533
This became one
of the quarantine rooms.

34:00.533 --> 34:02.267
We knocked a hole
in the garage

34:02.267 --> 34:04.300
off the back of the garage
and built another room.

34:04.300 --> 34:08.667
That room we use for dogs
that are heartworm-positive.

34:08.667 --> 34:10.067
Get on outta there.

34:10.067 --> 34:11.467
<i>The rest of the property,</i>

34:11.467 --> 34:13.567
<i>it's the same thing.</i>

34:13.567 --> 34:17.433
We live in-in the dogs' house.
We're the guest.

34:17.433 --> 34:19.266
- Okay.
- Okay.

34:20.766 --> 34:22.467
All right, kids.

34:36.367 --> 34:39.067
We got so many boxes
this time

34:39.067 --> 34:42.766
because there's a sale
going on for puppy pads.

34:42.766 --> 34:45.266
And any sale we can catch,
we like to do that.

34:46.632 --> 34:51.333
In each box,
there are... 40 pads.

34:53.667 --> 34:56.632
We got 50 boxes of pads.

35:05.500 --> 35:09.233
Unfortunately, with puppies,
they pee and poop a lot.

35:09.233 --> 35:13.533
So,
even though I changed this pen at 10:15 last night,

35:13.533 --> 35:16.567
it was totally trashed
this morning.

35:16.567 --> 35:20.067
So, anyway, we are scrubbing
the pens one by one.

57:45.133 --> 57:48.133
This is Kim Tudor
with Danny & Ron's Rescue

57:48.133 --> 57:50.200
calling about Cher.

57:50.200 --> 57:52.100
<i>Is this about the application?</i>

57:52.100 --> 57:55.000
Yes, I know you have
a young child in the house.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.067
How old is he?

57:56.067 --> 57:57.200
<i>Two and a half.</i>

57:57.200 --> 57:58.600
<i>I was thinking of a puppy</i>

57:58.600 --> 58:00.400
<i>because they might</i>
<i>grow up together</i>

58:00.400 --> 58:02.100
<i>and bond that way.</i>

58:02.100 --> 58:05.100
A lot of people adopt
and they forget,

58:05.100 --> 58:08.633
you know, what it was like
to housebreak a puppy.

58:08.633 --> 58:10.633
<i>I've got a-- I've got a two-and-a-half-year-old.</i>

58:10.633 --> 58:12.033
<i>I know...</i>

58:12.033 --> 58:13.400
Yeah.

58:13.400 --> 58:15.000
<i>But you're right.</i>
<i>You're right.</i>

58:15.000 --> 58:16.500
<i>With a puppy,</i>
<i>you gotta-- you gotta</i>

58:16.500 --> 58:18.300
<i>pay attention every minute</i>
<i>of the day.</i>

58:18.300 --> 58:20.333
<i>And it's-- Honestly,</i>
<i>it probably would be tough.</i>

58:20.333 --> 58:22.000
<i>An older dog?</i>

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
I think an older dog
perhaps

58:24.000 --> 58:26.200
and one that is
an owner-surrender

58:26.200 --> 58:28.500
that already came
from a family

58:28.500 --> 58:30.467
that had children.
- <i>Okay.</i>

58:30.467 --> 58:33.567
So he's been pre-tested
with children.

58:33.567 --> 58:35.233
<i>Yeah, that's good.</i>

58:35.233 --> 58:38.000
Okay, I know I'm gonna
make your day one day.

58:38.000 --> 58:39.467
<i>All right,</i>
<i>thank you so much.</i>

58:39.467 --> 58:41.500
All right? Okay.

58:41.500 --> 58:43.333
<i>One of the most frustrating things is,</i>

58:43.333 --> 58:46.067
<i>people want a puppy</i>
<i>so that their child</i>

58:46.067 --> 58:47.633
<i>or they can bond with it.</i>

58:47.633 --> 58:50.533
You can get a rescue dog
that's five years old.

58:50.533 --> 58:52.567
It will come into your house
and in two days,

58:52.567 --> 58:54.000
it will be bonded to you.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.500
<i>In choosing a pet,</i>

58:55.500 --> 58:58.167
<i>people need to assess</i>
<i>the situation they're in.</i>

58:58.167 --> 59:00.667
<i>Am I gonna be moving?</i>
<i>Do I have children?</i>

59:00.667 --> 59:02.733
<i>How much time do I really have?</i>

59:02.733 --> 59:06.167
Yes, I love animals,
but is this right for me now?

59:06.167 --> 59:08.100
Is this dog right
for me now?

59:08.100 --> 59:10.000
When I'm talking to people that are looking

59:10.000 --> 59:13.067
for a specific type of dog,
I like to have--

59:13.067 --> 59:16.633
This is my-- my vision wall,
so to speak.

59:16.633 --> 59:20.067
And I know every one
of these dogs.

59:20.067 --> 59:23.300
These are all the dogs
ready to go to a home now.

59:23.300 --> 59:26.367
Taryn came from California.

59:26.367 --> 59:30.167
I know that we are gonna
find a home for Madison.

59:30.167 --> 59:33.533
Moon is going
to go to Vermont.

59:33.533 --> 59:35.400
The dogs keep coming in
and hopefully

59:35.400 --> 59:37.367
they keep going out
to good homes.

59:40.700 --> 59:42.300
This is Bonnie.

59:42.300 --> 59:46.200
And she came in
from a bunch of dogs

59:46.200 --> 59:48.200
we got in
from a puppy mill.

59:48.200 --> 59:53.400
She's like hoarding
for toys in her bed.

59:53.400 --> 59:55.633
That would be a sign that they took the puppies away early

59:55.633 --> 59:57.233
so they can sell 'em.

59:57.233 --> 59:58.567
And then,
as soon as they could,

59:58.567 --> 01:00:00.267
they'd breed her
right back again.

01:00:00.267 --> 01:00:01.700
So they'd have more puppies.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.067
When I get a puppy mill dog
in like this

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:07.067
and I see it find a new home,
that's my reward.

01:00:07.067 --> 01:00:09.067
They come in scared,
don't want to--

01:00:09.067 --> 01:00:10.633
They just sit in the corner.

01:00:10.633 --> 01:00:12.733
And to see them blossom
and come out of the corner,

01:00:12.733 --> 01:00:14.767
to come and meet you...

01:00:14.767 --> 01:00:16.767
and then to finally
find their home,

01:00:16.767 --> 01:00:18.500
I just-- I love it.
I just--

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.000
It brings tears to my eyes
'cause it just--

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I'm happy for them.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.400
Here she is.

01:00:28.033 --> 01:00:30.067
Isn't she cute?

01:00:30.067 --> 01:00:32.400
Hi, baby!
You're all clean!

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.767
Does she look different?

01:00:33.767 --> 01:00:36.600
She looks so much better
than she did

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.567
when I first met her.
- Did she?

01:00:38.567 --> 01:00:40.433
- What did she look like then?
- She had such a sad look

01:00:40.433 --> 01:00:42.767
in her eye,
and over the few--

01:00:42.767 --> 01:00:44.733
maybe it's been
a month or so...

01:00:44.733 --> 01:00:46.000
Yes, mm-hmm.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.400
I've seen pictures of her,

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.433
and she's gotten
happier and happier.

01:00:49.433 --> 01:00:50.667
Hello.

01:00:50.667 --> 01:00:53.000
- Ron, this is Deborah Wanger.
- Hi, Deborah.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.500
- So nice to meet you.
- This is Ron Danta.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.667
- I've heard wonderful things about you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:00:56.667 --> 01:00:58.533
I'm so glad that
you're adopting her.

01:00:58.533 --> 01:01:00.267
- It's exciting.
- Thank you, we're so excited.

01:01:00.267 --> 01:01:02.167
To have Bonnie as part of our family.
- No, that's exciting.

01:01:02.167 --> 01:01:04.133
She's ready for a new home.

01:01:04.133 --> 01:01:06.333
And if you see any that can
fit in your purse or your car,

01:01:06.333 --> 01:01:07.733
you're welcome to take
some more home.

01:01:07.733 --> 01:01:10.533
Thank you!

01:01:21.767 --> 01:01:24.233
- Tuna get rinsed?
- Nope.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.067
<i>Our house is full of staff,</i>

01:01:39.067 --> 01:01:40.733
<i>our house is full</i>
<i>of people cleaning,</i>

01:01:40.733 --> 01:01:42.333
<i>taking dogs in and out.</i>

01:01:42.333 --> 01:01:45.333
<i>It's like living</i>
<i>in a business.</i>

01:01:45.333 --> 01:01:47.200
<i>There's no private time.</i>

01:01:48.333 --> 01:01:53.267
<i>There's no Danny and Ron time</i>
<i>that we're just alone.</i>

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.100
<i>We work together,</i>
<i>live together,</i>

01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:00.633
<i>spend practically</i>
<i>every hour together.</i>

01:02:00.633 --> 01:02:02.467
Believe it or not,
with all the time together,

01:02:02.467 --> 01:02:06.267
there's very little time
to talk and...

01:02:06.267 --> 01:02:09.267
and share what you're-- what we're thinking,

01:02:09.267 --> 01:02:12.500
except about stuff
that's pertinent to the dogs.

01:02:15.233 --> 01:02:18.100
But it's... it's not that
he's not there.

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:19.367
I know he's there.

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:26.433
I also know his heart
really bleeds for me

01:02:26.433 --> 01:02:29.200
when I'm in pain.

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:32.567
I know sometimes
it even may be harder on him.

01:02:34.433 --> 01:02:37.300
<i>Danny's had many health issues.</i>

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:39.633
<i>He has extreme</i>
<i>high blood pressure.</i>

01:02:42.633 --> 01:02:44.667
<i>I woke up pretty early,</i>

01:02:44.667 --> 01:02:47.533
<i>and I just thought something</i>
<i>doesn't feel right.</i>

01:02:47.533 --> 01:02:51.167
<i>I just said, "I feel like</i>
<i>I have a shield on my chest."</i>

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:52.667
It was very scary,
'cause we didn't know

01:02:52.667 --> 01:02:54.133
if he was having
a heart attack.

01:02:54.133 --> 01:02:55.633
That was our first instinct,

01:02:55.633 --> 01:02:57.333
you know, was having
a heart attack.

01:02:57.333 --> 01:02:59.633
I was, you know,
put in a car

01:02:59.633 --> 01:03:02.400
and run to the hospital,
and of course,

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.000
I was about tenth in line,
and, "You'll have to wait."

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.600
And I think then,
when I went down to the floor,

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.100
they realized it was a little
more important than that.

01:03:17.233 --> 01:03:18.367
Oops.

01:03:18.367 --> 01:03:20.000
<i>The doctor said,</i>

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
<i>"We have three layers</i>
<i>to our aorta,</i>

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.167
<i>"and his aorta is shredding.</i>

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:27.433
<i>"Each layer</i>
<i>is going one by one,</i>

01:03:27.433 --> 01:03:29.767
"and 90 out of 100 people
die within four hours,

01:03:29.767 --> 01:03:31.700
and there's nothing
we can do to stop it."

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:34.033
He said, "There's no medication
we can do."

01:03:34.033 --> 01:03:38.033
He said he's, you know,
probably going to die.

01:03:38.033 --> 01:03:41.033
<i>I immediately started crying.</i>

01:03:41.033 --> 01:03:43.633
<i>I mean, hearing a doctor say</i>
<i>there's nothing we can do</i>

01:03:43.633 --> 01:03:47.100
<i>to stop something,</i>
<i>that it's gonna be a wait-and-see</i>

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:51.433
<i>if he's the lucky 10 people</i>
<i>out of 100 that will survive.</i>

01:03:51.433 --> 01:03:54.300
<i>We all were very thankful</i>
<i>he made it,</i>

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:57.667
<i>but the doctor told us</i>
<i>that on the lucky side,</i>

01:03:57.667 --> 01:04:00.700
<i>he could live</i>
<i>three to five years.</i>

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:04.567
<i>It's been like 11 years.</i>

01:04:04.567 --> 01:04:07.500
Exact quotes
of Danny's doctor here,

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:10.333
I mean, she said he is
a walking miracle.

01:04:10.333 --> 01:04:15.067
<i>But we're kind of like</i>
<i>a ticking time bomb.</i>

01:04:15.067 --> 01:04:17.233
<i>He only has one layer now,</i>

01:04:17.233 --> 01:04:19.100
<i>so if his blood pressure</i>
<i>gets above 120,</i>

01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:20.767
<i>he could just rupture.</i>

01:04:20.767 --> 01:04:24.033
<i>If he ever bumped himself hard</i>
<i>or whatever, it could rupture.</i>

01:04:24.033 --> 01:04:26.733
<i>If he ever was in a car accident</i>
<i>and an airbag went off,</i>

01:04:26.733 --> 01:04:29.400
<i>that could do it.</i>

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.667
Gardening is, for me at least,
when I feel like I need

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:34.433
a little space
and wanna breathe a little bit,

01:04:34.433 --> 01:04:37.033
then I can come out
and do that,

01:04:37.033 --> 01:04:38.467
and I can have my sad moments

01:04:38.467 --> 01:04:40.700
and my trying moments
with myself,

01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:44.600
and the moments
that other people

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:48.700
I don't think necessarily
need to share all the time.

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:50.733
But maybe it does me
a little bit of good.

01:04:50.733 --> 01:04:53.500
And then I go back
and then I think about

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:55.200
some of the animals
buried here

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.333
and the nourishment
they're giving this,

01:04:58.333 --> 01:05:00.267
and feel like maybe
it's a little good luck charm

01:05:00.267 --> 01:05:03.167
maybe helping me keep some
of these things alive.

01:05:03.167 --> 01:05:06.433
And, uh...

01:05:06.433 --> 01:05:08.767
like, this horrible-looking
little lily here.

01:05:08.767 --> 01:05:10.733
It looked beautiful earlier.

01:05:10.733 --> 01:05:13.433
Believe it or not,
it was my grandmother's,

01:05:13.433 --> 01:05:15.233
and she died
when I was six.

01:05:15.233 --> 01:05:19.200
So, that lily family
has lasted a long time.

01:05:24.167 --> 01:05:26.300
So,
what's happening with the Poms?

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:29.700
<i>I might be able to send five or six to you.</i>

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:31.000
- Okay.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.333
<i>And we're going to
give you the three with the leg issues?</i>

01:05:33.333 --> 01:05:36.133
It doesn't matter, I just--
you know, with those three,

01:05:36.133 --> 01:05:38.367
they're gonna be laid up
quite a while with surgery,

01:05:38.367 --> 01:05:40.367
so they're gonna be
non-adoptables for a while.

01:05:40.367 --> 01:05:43.100
I mean, the sad part
is good breeders,

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:47.133
the last thing they wanna do
is breed genetic defects.

01:05:47.133 --> 01:05:50.367
Obviously, this-- this is like
your typical puppy mill breeder

01:05:50.367 --> 01:05:51.633
where she's just doing it

01:05:51.633 --> 01:05:53.500
just to get the ching-ching
and the puppies.

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:57.133
<i>They throw their garbage away that's not selling.</i>

01:05:57.133 --> 01:05:59.433
Right.

01:05:59.433 --> 01:06:01.667
<i>So what are they doing?</i>
<i>Giving them to rescues so we can foot the bill.</i>

01:06:03.367 --> 01:06:05.200
The Pomeranians
on the transport,

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.767
they said some of 'em
are hateful,

01:06:07.767 --> 01:06:11.100
growly, scared.

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:14.067
So, they're gonna separate 'em,
I guess, in crates.

01:06:14.067 --> 01:06:16.700
But there's still like
20 more Poms-- Pomeranians

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:18.367
at her house.

01:06:18.367 --> 01:06:20.167
They couldn't get all of 'em,
I guess. Right.

01:06:20.167 --> 01:06:22.300
You can see some of them have little coat issues.

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:25.567
I know, this one they
told-- is a very bad fear-biter.

01:06:25.567 --> 01:06:27.500
And that's the chi...

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:30.467
That's the Chihuahua mix
that was gonna be euthanized,

01:06:30.467 --> 01:06:32.267
so I agreed to take it.

01:06:32.267 --> 01:06:35.433
The reason the woman
is giving up dogs right now

01:06:35.433 --> 01:06:37.633
is because for some reason
or the other,

01:06:37.633 --> 01:06:41.000
she couldn't sell them
as young puppies,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.767
so now, they're older dogs,
she can't do much with 'em.

01:06:44.767 --> 01:06:46.733
This girl that's picking up
all these dogs,

01:06:46.733 --> 01:06:49.433
she has to go meet somewhere
and pick the dogs up.

01:06:49.433 --> 01:06:51.467
Most puppy mill places
will not let you come

01:06:51.467 --> 01:06:53.367
into their facility.

01:06:53.367 --> 01:06:56.000
Usually, the facility is such
that it would be closed down

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.500
if anybody could figure out
where it was.

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.500
So, they're protecting
themselves.

01:07:14.433 --> 01:07:16.700
- All right.
- You made it!

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:19.267
- How was your trip?
- Oh, it was great.

01:07:19.267 --> 01:07:20.767
Okay, let me carry
the crates inside.

01:07:20.767 --> 01:07:23.033
- Do these have names?
- Yes, I have the names.

01:07:23.033 --> 01:07:25.267
And then we're gonna
figure out which ones...

01:07:25.267 --> 01:07:27.533
and then we're gonna find out
which ones have to have surgery?

01:07:27.533 --> 01:07:29.367
Yes. Yes.
Knee surgery?

01:07:29.367 --> 01:07:30.567
Is that all of them?

01:07:30.567 --> 01:07:32.167
That's all of them.

01:07:32.167 --> 01:07:34.533
And we gotta find
teeny collars.

01:07:34.533 --> 01:07:37.367
Hi.
Think you'd come with me?

01:07:37.367 --> 01:07:41.200
Come on.
Good baby, good baby.

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.500
Yes, you are very fluffy, huh?

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.767
She said
she raises show dogs.

01:07:45.767 --> 01:07:48.167
You know, I've never
seen a show dog

01:07:48.167 --> 01:07:49.767
that looks
in these conditions.

01:07:49.767 --> 01:07:51.700
Some of them are scared,
there's some other ones

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.200
that are fear-biters.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.267
Three of these
have patella problems,

01:07:55.267 --> 01:07:57.100
which is the knee joint
on a dog.

01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:00.433
They slip out, so we're gonna
have to do surgery.

01:08:00.433 --> 01:08:03.100
We don't know if that's
like a genetic defect,

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:05.033
or from them
just living, you know,

01:08:05.033 --> 01:08:06.500
without getting exercise.

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:09.067
These dogs probably lived
in wire rabbit cages

01:08:09.067 --> 01:08:10.667
their whole life, so...
- We don't really know.

01:08:10.667 --> 01:08:12.367
These could have been
breeding dogs

01:08:12.367 --> 01:08:14.400
or they could have just
sort of passed the prime

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.200
of sales time.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.433
You can feel all
the knots and mats.

01:08:18.433 --> 01:08:20.466
Oh, yeah,
they're solid mats.

01:08:20.466 --> 01:08:22.100
Many times, these dogs
have to be sheared

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:23.767
all the way down.

01:08:23.767 --> 01:08:26.466
Basically, they fall
under all the conditions

01:08:26.466 --> 01:08:28.332
of a puppy mill.

01:08:31.167 --> 01:08:33.300
<i>Puppy mills,</i>
<i>people just don't realize</i>

01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:34.700
<i>how horrific it is.</i>

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:37.667
So many of these dogs
live in rabbit cages.

01:08:37.667 --> 01:08:40.332
We rescued dachshunds,
and they could not turn around

01:08:40.332 --> 01:08:42.399
<i>their entire life</i>
<i>in a rabbit cage,</i>

01:08:42.399 --> 01:08:44.000
<i>so they rubbed their noses off,</i>

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.399
<i>and they rubbed</i>
<i>their fannies off</i>

01:08:45.399 --> 01:08:47.100
<i>and their tails off because</i>
<i>they could never</i>

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:48.600
<i>turn around in a cage.</i>

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.700
<i>So many times, the breeding dog</i>

01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:53.633
<i>have had 12 and 13 litters</i>
<i>of dogs,</i>

01:08:53.633 --> 01:08:56.567
<i>and they've never even put</i>
<i>their feet on the ground.</i>

01:08:56.567 --> 01:08:59.767
<i>Puppy mills inbreed</i>
<i>the dogs so terribly.</i>

01:08:59.767 --> 01:09:03.167
<i>They'll take dogs and keep</i>
<i>trying to breed them down</i>

01:09:03.167 --> 01:09:06.600
<i>in size, in cuteness,</i>
<i>in color, in fluff,</i>

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.733
to get the smallest,
little funkiest little things

01:09:08.733 --> 01:09:11.100
that nobody can resist.

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:14.100
And a lot of times,
they're full of health issues.

01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:17.167
<i>They're just gonna do as little</i>
<i>as they can possibly do,</i>

01:09:17.167 --> 01:09:20.600
<i>because it's about the dollar,</i>
<i>not about the animal.</i>

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:25.133
99.9 % of all puppies

01:09:25.133 --> 01:09:27.633
sold in pet stores
come from puppy mills.

01:09:27.633 --> 01:09:29.466
That's a proven fact.

01:09:29.466 --> 01:09:32.399
The minute those puppies get
to be four to five weeks old,

01:09:32.399 --> 01:09:34.233
they're snatched away
from their mother,

01:09:34.233 --> 01:09:36.500
off they go to all
these pet stores.

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:39.033
When you see pets through the computer,

01:09:39.033 --> 01:09:40.767
or on Craigslist and stuff,

01:09:40.767 --> 01:09:44.233
and they offer this many
varieties and breeds,

01:09:44.233 --> 01:09:47.167
very often, that's a sign
that it's a puppy mill,

01:09:47.167 --> 01:09:50.100
because they just
have too much to offer.

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:52.000
<i>People tell us all the time</i>

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.267
that they really saved
this dog's life,

01:09:54.267 --> 01:09:56.000
they rescued it,
even though they paid

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.633
$1,800 from the pet store.

01:09:57.633 --> 01:10:00.567
That is a very bad
misconception,

01:10:00.567 --> 01:10:03.733
that you think because
it was in that puppy store,

01:10:03.733 --> 01:10:05.433
you really saved its life.

01:10:05.433 --> 01:10:09.400
You didn't, you just contributed
to the puppy mill,

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.133
'cause that's what keeps
the wheel going.

01:10:11.133 --> 01:10:13.167
If people would not buy
from pet stores,

01:10:13.167 --> 01:10:15.133
puppy mills will go
out of business.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:17.700
Let's get 'em outside.

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:19.733
All right, guys.

01:10:19.733 --> 01:10:21.667
All right, I'm gonna go get
some water buckets.

01:10:21.667 --> 01:10:23.000
Okay.

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:28.333
Hi, guys.
Guess what, freedom!

01:10:28.333 --> 01:10:31.433
<i>Once we say,
"You're part of Danny & Ron's Rescue,"</i>

01:10:31.433 --> 01:10:34.367
<i>we promise every dog,</i>
<i>you will never end up</i>

01:10:34.367 --> 01:10:37.767
<i>in a shelter again,</i>
<i>or end up wandering the streets</i>

01:10:37.767 --> 01:10:41.300
or starving, or needy,
or not being loved.

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:44.467
<i>If they are capable of having</i>
<i>a good quality of life,</i>

01:10:44.467 --> 01:10:47.033
<i>and hopefully be adopted</i>
<i>by someone,</i>

01:10:47.033 --> 01:10:48.467
then we'll stick by it
and get it done,

01:10:48.467 --> 01:10:50.067
whatever it takes.

01:10:50.067 --> 01:10:52.333
<i>When they come into our rescue,</i>

01:10:52.333 --> 01:10:53.733
<i>this is their safe haven.</i>

01:10:53.733 --> 01:10:57.567
<i>So, even if we consider them</i>
<i>non-adoptable,</i>

01:10:57.567 --> 01:10:59.600
they will live
their life out here,

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.067
and they will be safe.

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:07.533
<i>We have a handful of permanent residents</i>

01:11:07.533 --> 01:11:09.600
<i>that look like they're going</i>
<i>to be here</i>

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:12.100
<i>for a long, long time.</i>

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:14.067
<i>Some of them already have.</i>

01:11:14.067 --> 01:11:17.167
<i>We got Amelia at a local animal shelter.</i>

01:11:17.167 --> 01:11:20.333
<i>Amelia has a very bad back end,</i>

01:11:20.333 --> 01:11:22.267
<i>and she looks like</i>
<i>a wheelbarrow.</i>

01:11:22.267 --> 01:11:24.600
<i>No one has ever been able to find out what's wrong with her.</i>

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:28.467
<i>We've done MRIs, CAT scans,</i>
<i>X-rays, the whole nine yards.</i>

01:11:28.467 --> 01:11:31.633
<i>And everybody knows that one be</i>
<i>in the fireplace is Amelia's,</i>

01:11:31.633 --> 01:11:33.733
<i>and you don't go</i>
<i>in Amelia's bed.</i>

01:11:33.733 --> 01:11:36.367
<i>She's little,</i>
<i>she only weighs 10 pounds,</i>

01:11:36.367 --> 01:11:38.100
<i>but she could be</i>
<i>a little piranha</i>

01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:39.300
<i>when she needs to be.</i>

01:11:40.733 --> 01:11:43.033
<i>Maggie was shot.</i>

01:11:43.033 --> 01:11:45.133
<i>We had to have</i>
<i>her leg amputated.</i>

01:11:45.133 --> 01:11:48.000
<i>She's been on our website</i>
<i>for years.</i>

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.700
<i>Nobody has reached out</i>
<i>any interest in her.</i>

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:55.233
<i>Mona is a very special dog.</i>

01:11:55.233 --> 01:11:58.433
<i>Mona was hit by a car</i>
<i>and had severe injuries</i>

01:11:58.433 --> 01:12:00.500
<i>to her hind end.</i>

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:02.167
Unfortunately,
at the shelter,

01:12:02.167 --> 01:12:04.667
they left her 12 weeks
in a crate.

01:12:04.667 --> 01:12:07.033
<i>She's never in any pain,</i>

01:12:07.033 --> 01:12:09.500
<i>but she has quite a bit</i>
<i>of hitch in her giddyup.</i>

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.233
<i>Lucky was turned</i>
<i>into our local animal shelter</i>

01:12:16.233 --> 01:12:17.700
<i>here in Camden.</i>

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:21.167
<i>He was found on the highway</i>
<i>by a good Samaritan.</i>

01:12:21.167 --> 01:12:24.033
<i>We've had him three years.</i>

01:12:25.433 --> 01:12:27.567
<i>He was showing some signs</i>
<i>of discomfort.</i>

01:12:27.567 --> 01:12:31.267
<i>The vets found</i>
<i>a malignant tumor on his liver,</i>

01:12:31.267 --> 01:12:36.067
<i>and unfortunately, liver tumors</i>
<i>they spread very quickly.</i>

01:12:36.067 --> 01:12:37.400
Any dog that we take,

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.167
we promise them a happy life

01:12:39.167 --> 01:12:41.667
and a happy departure
from life.

01:12:41.667 --> 01:12:43.267
Knowing him like we have

01:12:43.267 --> 01:12:45.467
and living with him
like we have,

01:12:45.467 --> 01:12:49.000
we knew that the time
was getting close.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.467
<i>No one wants to let go,</i>
<i>nobody wants the end,</i>

01:12:52.467 --> 01:12:54.233
<i>but people have to realize,</i>

01:12:54.233 --> 01:12:56.367
when they see their pets
getting to the point

01:12:56.367 --> 01:12:58.700
where the quality
of life is gone,

01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:01.500
and they're no longer
that pet that they knew,

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:05.433
that the one beautiful thing
we can do is do the right thing

01:13:05.433 --> 01:13:07.700
<i>and let them go out</i>
<i>the right way.</i>

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:10.600
Hey, Danny,
come on in here.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.300
Hey, Brad.

01:13:16.567 --> 01:13:20.433
I still remember
the goose-egg bladder stone

01:13:20.433 --> 01:13:22.033
we pulled out of him.
- Yes.

01:13:22.033 --> 01:13:23.600
I hate this.

01:13:27.067 --> 01:13:28.467
No more pain for you.

01:13:28.467 --> 01:13:31.033
Yeah, I hate it.

01:13:31.033 --> 01:13:32.167
He sure has been sweet.

01:13:32.167 --> 01:13:35.200
Yeah, that's--
oh, I know.

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:38.267
He's one of the ones
I'll never forget.

01:13:43.167 --> 01:13:44.767
It's okay.

01:14:02.133 --> 01:14:04.033
You're our lucky guy, boy.

01:14:04.033 --> 01:14:07.167
Yeah. Okay.

01:14:07.167 --> 01:14:08.000
Thanks, Brad.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.300
Yeah. Sorry, man.

01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:10.633
Okay.

01:14:10.633 --> 01:14:12.600
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sorry, man.

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:15.267
He was a trooper.

01:14:25.033 --> 01:14:28.500
Okay, I gotta pick up
two dogs...

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.600
...that got
dropped off here, so...

01:14:34.433 --> 01:14:36.767
♪♪

01:15:14.167 --> 01:15:16.567
Didn't find her.
You all right?

01:15:16.567 --> 01:15:18.633
We'll start here.

01:15:44.067 --> 01:15:46.133
Never forget the day...

01:15:46.133 --> 01:15:48.700
...we picked him up.

01:15:55.467 --> 01:15:59.200
♪♪

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.500
How many are there?

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:38.000
Mm,
probably about 40 to 50.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.333
Oh, that's adorable.

01:16:40.333 --> 01:16:42.533
Well, let's keep scrolling.
There's a lot of 'em.

01:16:42.533 --> 01:16:44.667
- Oh, that's--
- What about that one?

01:16:44.667 --> 01:16:46.067
Oh, my God, she has...

01:16:46.067 --> 01:16:48.167
Lhasa Apso Shih Tzu.

01:16:48.167 --> 01:16:51.000
- And he's got that horrible, wonderful underbite.
- Funny underbite.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.567
Does it say
anything else?

01:16:52.567 --> 01:16:56.300
Just says "Critical,
11 years old."

01:17:03.467 --> 01:17:04.667
Is that something you're probably

01:17:04.667 --> 01:17:06.067
gonna get adopted out, or no?

01:17:06.067 --> 01:17:07.267
No, get as many out as possible.

01:17:07.267 --> 01:17:08.400
Like, we are so...

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.767
I mean, 'cause those
are plain black,

01:17:09.767 --> 01:17:11.433
so they're probably
not gonna get adopted.

01:17:16.233 --> 01:17:19.700
She has a tumor on her side
that's pretty...

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.300
it's pretty big.
Okay.

01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.433
All right, Cornbread.

01:17:25.367 --> 01:17:27.167
Off to the vets we go.

01:17:27.167 --> 01:17:30.267
<i>I'm hoping and praying that we can get</i>

01:17:30.267 --> 01:17:35.033
<i>a lot of young people to start</i>
<i>learning the ropes of rescue,</i>

01:17:35.033 --> 01:17:39.467
<i>so that when Danny and I</i>
<i>are not on this earth,</i>

01:17:39.467 --> 01:17:43.267
<i>dogs' lives will continue</i>
<i>to be saved.</i>

01:17:44.467 --> 01:17:46.500
Usually, these type of dogs,

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:49.333
the only way you're gonna
catch them is a trap.

01:17:49.333 --> 01:17:50.733
We'll just hang out and hopefully...
- Okay.

01:17:50.733 --> 01:17:51.733
...we might get lucky.

01:17:52.767 --> 01:17:55.733
There's the meal.
Okay.

01:18:00.267 --> 01:18:02.333
There was something
about the look in her eye

01:18:02.333 --> 01:18:05.333
that made me feel like
she's really lost here.

01:18:05.333 --> 01:18:07.167
Hey, baby.

01:18:07.167 --> 01:18:09.700
- She was owner-surrendered because
her owner is going through chemo,

01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:13.100
and is not expected to make it
much longer.

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:15.100
- Okay, there you go,
sweetie.

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:17.300
You need a bath.
I can smell you.

01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:19.100
Oh, watch so he doesn't
go out the window.

01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:21.533
Uh-uh, don't go
out that window, uh-oh.

01:18:21.533 --> 01:18:25.467
<i>We've done some talking about retirement,</i>

01:18:25.467 --> 01:18:29.133
but what would I do if I didn't
have horses or dogs?

01:18:29.133 --> 01:18:31.100
You know, so what would
my life be then?

01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:32.733
It wouldn't be my life.

01:18:32.733 --> 01:18:35.500
So, there's not really
a choice in that.

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:37.233
I'm gonna give you my name and my cell number.

01:18:37.233 --> 01:18:39.100
If you have
any issues medically,

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.633
or have any questions,
just call us.

01:18:40.633 --> 01:18:42.667
Or if you need help with food,
or whatever you need,

01:18:42.667 --> 01:18:45.433
we will be happy
to assist you for his life.

01:18:49.367 --> 01:18:51.067
<i>This is Heather.</i>

01:18:51.067 --> 01:18:52.700
Hey, Heather,
this is Ron Danta.

01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:54.233
<i>Hey, how are you?</i>

01:18:54.233 --> 01:18:55.533
I'm good, how are you?

01:18:55.533 --> 01:18:57.333
<i>Money's so tight right now</i>

01:18:57.333 --> 01:18:59.667
that I had to go take
a loan out for the rescue,

01:18:59.667 --> 01:19:03.333
so that we can hopefully
make it until December.

01:19:03.333 --> 01:19:09.567
<i>The only thing, since the loan is for over $50,000,
we would have to have an appraisal done.</i>

01:19:09.567 --> 01:19:12.667
<i>That's going to</i>
<i>cost around $400.</i>

01:19:12.667 --> 01:19:15.333
Okay, why don't we do it at 50,

01:19:15.333 --> 01:19:17.667
and then if I wind up
needing more money,

01:19:17.667 --> 01:19:20.500
then I can probably do
the appraisal and up it...

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.333
'cause I hate spending
the 400-something

01:19:22.333 --> 01:19:23.567
if I don't have to.

01:19:23.567 --> 01:19:26.067
<i>Right, okay. So, do it at 50?</i>

01:19:26.067 --> 01:19:27.067
Yes.

01:19:27.333 --> 01:19:29.633
<i>If we won the lottery today,</i>

01:19:29.633 --> 01:19:32.333
I would buy a massive bus

01:19:32.333 --> 01:19:35.267
<i>and hire two or three vets</i>
<i>full time,</i>

01:19:35.267 --> 01:19:39.067
travel from state to state,

01:19:39.067 --> 01:19:41.067

01:19:41.067 --> 01:19:42.333
Going home, huh?

01:19:42.333 --> 01:19:43.633
<i>There would be veterinarians</i>
<i>on the road</i>

01:19:43.633 --> 01:19:45.600
