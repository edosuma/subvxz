<i>K-Hey, Southern California!</i>

01:55.023 --> 01:59.357
Mr. Simpson, just a severe sprain.
In fact, it's kind of a minor miracle.

01:59.527 --> 02:01.722
But we'd like you to stay
for observation...

02:01.896 --> 02:05.093
Thank you, doctor. That's good
to hear, but I really have to go.

02:05.266 --> 02:06.631
Excuse me.

02:10.471 --> 02:12.996
Mr. Simpson, this precaution is
for your own good.

02:13.174 --> 02:16.075
Thank you, doctor, thank you.
Hey, nice talking to you.

02:18.713 --> 02:20.180
Excuse me.

02:21.416 --> 02:24.146
-Mr. Simpson? Doug Simpson?
-Yes.

02:24.318 --> 02:26.843
I'm Detective Nyland.
This is Sergeant Stockdale.

02:27.021 --> 02:29.012
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

02:29.190 --> 02:33.718
What for, guys? No one got hurt
here but me. I really have to go.

02:33.895 --> 02:37.695
Well, I'm afraid that won't be possible.
We have to have a statement.

02:37.865 --> 02:39.992
I can't press charges against myself.

02:40.168 --> 02:44.070
Look, you either talk to us here,
or you talk to us downtown.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.408
Here. Here's good.

02:48.009 --> 02:51.536
<i>97.5 KHEY-FM.</i>

02:51.713 --> 02:54.910
<i>K-Hey, Southern California!</i>

02:57.051 --> 03:01.488
<i>Okay, Mr. Simpson, tell us,</i>
<i>how did all this start?</i>

03:01.656 --> 03:05.422
<i>For the past 10 years,</i>
<i>I've been manager of KHEY Radio.</i>

03:05.593 --> 03:08.756
<i>I've also been raising my two</i>
<i>daughters since my wife died...</i>

03:08.930 --> 03:12.263
<i>...and doing pretty good at both jobs,</i>
<i>if I have to say so myself.</i>

03:12.433 --> 03:15.027
<i>-So?</i>
-So, what if our ratings have slipped?

03:15.203 --> 03:17.865
What's wrong
with being number six?

03:19.307 --> 03:23.038
Ninety-two other stations in this town
would love to be number 6.

03:23.211 --> 03:26.942
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Bye.

03:27.115 --> 03:29.640
Loved the way you handled that.

03:29.817 --> 03:33.218
I love the radio business, love you.

03:33.387 --> 03:37.380
I don't care if we're number 6
or number 60. I'm sticking with you.

03:37.558 --> 03:39.651
Why are we talking numbers, huh?

03:40.361 --> 03:43.023
The only number I'm interested
in today is 15.

03:43.197 --> 03:47.156
My little girl's 15th birthday.
And I am going home.

03:47.335 --> 03:49.166
And well you should be.

03:57.311 --> 04:00.144
-Pitch, pitch.
-I like a little flat. It's hip.

04:02.316 --> 04:06.082
<i>97.5 KHEY-FM.</i>

04:06.254 --> 04:08.518
<i>From B.B. King to Buddy Holly...</i>

04:08.689 --> 04:12.523
<i>...we shake, rattle and roll</i>
<i>2 4 hours a day.</i>

04:16.998 --> 04:20.593
<i>Yeah, it should have been one</i>
<i>of the happiest days of my life.</i>

04:20.767 --> 04:22.895
<i>But I didn't see it coming.</i>

04:23.070 --> 04:27.769
<i>Maybe I should have seen it coming.</i>
<i>Maybe I didn't want to see it coming.</i>

04:27.942 --> 04:30.502
<i>No father sees it coming.</i>

04:39.487 --> 04:40.749
Dad?

04:41.155 --> 04:42.383
Honey?

04:47.995 --> 04:49.860
Go, Dad, go!

04:51.899 --> 04:54.094
Daddy, you're only 37.

04:54.268 --> 04:57.396
Kareem is 41 ,
and he does this every night.

04:58.439 --> 05:02.170
Well, Kareem's got Magic
passing to him. Look who I've got.

05:05.813 --> 05:08.873
Let's clean this kitchen.
Simpson's System on the double.

05:09.050 --> 05:10.608
Yes, sir.

05:10.785 --> 05:14.243
Where's Katie? Katie! Katie!

05:47.221 --> 05:48.620
Hi, Dad.

05:53.327 --> 05:56.296
Come on, come on, there you go.

06:00.468 --> 06:02.231
Take it easy.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.769
Gee, working hard.

06:05.406 --> 06:06.634
Well....

06:08.175 --> 06:09.403
Happy birthday.

06:09.577 --> 06:14.674
-Dad, I already have a teddy bear.
-Well, I know, but it's pretty beat-up.

06:14.849 --> 06:19.047
I mean, it was for your first 15 years,
and this is for your next 15.

06:20.955 --> 06:24.049
-Thanks, Dad.
-Happy birthday.

06:25.159 --> 06:27.787
And now, for your real present.

06:29.297 --> 06:30.696
Europe.

06:30.865 --> 06:32.765
Oh, Dad....

06:34.435 --> 06:36.869
I've been doing some thinking...

06:37.038 --> 06:40.474
...and I'm not sure I want to go
on the school trip this summer.

06:40.641 --> 06:42.734
Oh, you're kidding. Why?

06:43.144 --> 06:46.875
Well, you're gonna be all alone.
I mean, who's gonna take care of you?

06:47.048 --> 06:49.414
Bonnie's too young.
Well, there's Janet, but--

06:49.583 --> 06:53.212
Come on, Katie. Now, stop worrying
about me and forget about Janet.

06:53.387 --> 06:56.788
This is your life we're talking about,
right? Come on, sit down.

06:56.958 --> 07:00.121
Look, I'd love to take that ticket
and tear it right up.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.057
Keep you right here this summer.

07:02.229 --> 07:05.926
But you have to go. It's important.
I mean, it's Europe.

07:06.100 --> 07:11.197
The Eiffel Tower, Piccadilly Circus.
And the canals in Venice.

07:11.372 --> 07:15.206
And <i>Roma</i>. Go find out
where spaghetti was born.

07:15.643 --> 07:19.477
Dad, spaghetti was invented in China.
Marco Polo brought it back to ltaly.

07:19.647 --> 07:23.708
Yeah? Well, what about the meatballs,
Miss Straight-A Student?

07:23.985 --> 07:26.317
Let's get Schwarzenegger, Jr.

07:27.421 --> 07:31.152
Hey, Richard, let's go.
Get over here, pronto.

07:31.892 --> 07:35.123
-Big night tonight, Mr. Simpson.
-You don't want to miss it.

07:35.296 --> 07:37.491
Happy birthday.
Did you get my flowers?

07:37.665 --> 07:41.897
-Yeah, Richard. You didn't have to.
-Okay, let's go.

07:43.871 --> 07:45.566
I love you.

07:47.708 --> 07:53.078
Okay, let's move it. Simpson's System.
Katie, on the double.

08:20.674 --> 08:23.268
Is there something wrong
with your sister?

08:23.444 --> 08:27.403
-What am I, my sister's keeper?
-Funny.

08:28.783 --> 08:31.775
Don't move. I'll be right back.

08:39.659 --> 08:41.058
Excuse me.

08:41.662 --> 08:45.098
Richard, Richard, take it easy.
You'll hurt yourself.

08:45.866 --> 08:47.857
Check you later, dude.

08:50.037 --> 08:51.504
Well, what's with you?

08:51.672 --> 08:55.130
First, you make me bring you to this
crazy place, then you flake out.

08:55.309 --> 08:57.800
Yeah, what fun,
dancing with my daddy.

08:57.978 --> 09:02.472
They don't know I'm your daddy.
They just think you like old men.

09:05.319 --> 09:07.310
Suck it up, pal.

09:08.355 --> 09:12.815
-Dad, do you think I'm pretty?
-Of course I do.

09:12.993 --> 09:15.359
You're saying that
because you're my father.

09:15.529 --> 09:18.396
-That's not true.
-Okay.

09:18.566 --> 09:20.761
Am I as pretty as her?

09:28.709 --> 09:30.199
Dad!

09:36.684 --> 09:38.083
Dad!

09:39.286 --> 09:40.947
-Daddy!
-I saw that.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.022
-Happy birthday, baby.
-Hi.

09:43.190 --> 09:46.523
-Sorry I'm late. Don't worry.
-Okay.

09:47.394 --> 09:49.919
Where were you?
You missed blowing out the candles.

09:50.097 --> 09:53.931
The fabric did not come in. I had
to redesign half the fall collection.

09:54.101 --> 09:55.898
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

09:56.070 --> 09:58.595
-It's okay. I forgive you.
-Thanks.

09:59.740 --> 10:03.232
It's the first time you missed it,
though, since she's 12 years old.

10:03.410 --> 10:07.141
-Oh, God.
-Believe it? Three years already.

10:07.314 --> 10:09.544
-Three years? Us?
-Yeah.

10:14.788 --> 10:17.154
-How was the party?
-It was great. Really good.

10:17.324 --> 10:19.792
I guess she didn't tell you
about Richard, then?

10:19.960 --> 10:21.985
-What about Richard?
-It's okay.

10:22.163 --> 10:25.326
Just get yourself a double KahlÃºa
punch. Take a deep breath.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.467
-A double?
-A double. It's okay.

10:44.752 --> 10:46.185
I'm waiting.

10:47.154 --> 10:52.182
Daddy, I've been going steady
with Richard since elementary school.

10:53.127 --> 10:56.358
I think it's about time
I started dating other guys.

10:56.530 --> 10:58.794
Katie, come on,
you don't really mean that.

10:58.966 --> 11:02.595
How could you do that to Richard?
He's practically part of our family.

11:02.770 --> 11:04.203
Dad, that's the problem.

11:04.371 --> 11:07.670
We're more like brother and sister
than boyfriend and girlfriend.

11:07.841 --> 11:11.106
There's just no passion
in our relationship.

11:11.278 --> 11:15.408
Katie, you and Richard, you're just 15.
Passion comes later.

11:15.583 --> 11:17.744
Much later. Way later.

11:17.918 --> 11:23.151
Daddy, I'm breaking up with Richard.
There's just no magic between us.

11:23.958 --> 11:28.054
Dad, I understand how you feel,
but he's still your friend.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.754
And if you want to see him,
it's all right.

11:30.931 --> 11:35.994
Just let me know when he's coming,
so I can make myself scarce.

11:42.810 --> 11:46.109
One more, please. Less pineapple.

12:00.794 --> 12:05.094
I'm only gone for a little while.
While I'm gone, be careful because--

12:05.266 --> 12:06.494
They're out there.

12:06.667 --> 12:11.468
Now, you behave yourself. I know what
those wild radio conventions are like.

12:11.639 --> 12:14.301
-Yeah, don't bring home anything.
-Hey, you, hey.

12:14.475 --> 12:17.103
Knock it off.
I'm supposed to say those things.

12:17.278 --> 12:19.644
Just what I need,
more women in my life.

12:19.813 --> 12:22.941
-I need more women in my life.
-Come on, come on. Let's go.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.677
-Hey, take care of my girls.
-I will.

12:25.853 --> 12:27.377
One, two, three.

12:27.554 --> 12:29.954
We love you.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.426
-Bye.
-Come on.

12:54.248 --> 12:56.978
Well, so you're sure you want
to go through with it?

12:57.151 --> 12:59.278
I never wanted anything more
in my life.

12:59.453 --> 13:00.852
Okay.

13:01.855 --> 13:04.449
-Here we go.
-Yeah!

13:11.332 --> 13:16.861
You know, these braces are not due
to come off for another two months.

13:18.906 --> 13:20.669
Yank them, doc.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.536
Now.

13:29.216 --> 13:31.980
Excuse me. Simpson.
We have an appointment.

13:32.152 --> 13:34.416
A wash and a rinse?

13:34.888 --> 13:37.049
Then send her to Felipe.

13:37.224 --> 13:39.249
Felipe!

13:41.495 --> 13:43.861
It's okay. Thank you.

14:00.647 --> 14:02.638
How do they feel, Katie?

14:23.303 --> 14:24.861
Higher.

14:27.107 --> 14:28.506
Higher.

14:29.877 --> 14:31.276
Not that high.

14:58.205 --> 14:59.729
Take it easy.

15:16.423 --> 15:18.015
I'm home.

15:20.627 --> 15:24.495
-Hi, sweetheart, could you get that?
-Okay.

15:24.665 --> 15:28.829
-Hi, Daddy.
-Hi, baby. Happy to be home.

15:30.237 --> 15:33.638
Hello. I'm not sure.
Hang on one second.

15:33.807 --> 15:38.301
-Katie, it's for you.
-I'm on the phone. Take a message.

15:38.479 --> 15:42.745
Katie can't come to the phone
right now. Can I take a message?

15:42.916 --> 15:47.546
Mark? Right. Okay, Mark,
I'll tell her you called. Bye-bye.

15:51.992 --> 15:54.517
Hello? Hold on.

15:54.695 --> 15:58.756
-Katie, it's for you.
-She told you. She's on the phone.

16:00.534 --> 16:04.436
Katie can't come to the phone
right now. Can I take a message?

16:04.605 --> 16:07.301
Okay, Bob. Yeah, I'll tell her.

16:07.474 --> 16:10.637
Bob, do you know
that Katie has her own phone?

16:10.911 --> 16:15.314
It's been busy for two hours?
Oh, sorry, Bob. Bye.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.148
Hang on.

16:21.321 --> 16:24.017
What's going on here?

16:25.058 --> 16:29.620
-Hi. Is Katie ready yet?
-Ready for what?

16:30.631 --> 16:33.191
Andy? I'll be right down.

17:19.313 --> 17:20.803
Dad?

17:21.815 --> 17:26.411
-Well, isn't it great? Janet helped me.
-Isn't she beautiful, Doug?

17:26.587 --> 17:27.917
Doug?

17:30.123 --> 17:32.284
Dad, say something.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.588
Doug?

17:34.761 --> 17:37.662
-Oh, well, we gotta go.
-Yeah.

17:37.831 --> 17:39.458
-See you later.
-Okay.

17:39.633 --> 17:43.535
-Bye, Daddy.
-Have a good time.

17:43.704 --> 17:45.934
-Okay. Bye-bye.
-Bye.

17:46.406 --> 17:48.966
Doug, what do you think?

17:49.142 --> 17:51.576
Dad, what do you really think?

17:52.779 --> 17:56.010
What do I really think?
Who was that kid?

17:56.683 --> 18:00.278
-Andy, from down the street.
-No, no, no. The one in the skirt.

18:00.454 --> 18:03.651
She cannot stay a little girl forever.
She is growing up.

18:03.824 --> 18:06.987
This did not happen overnight.
It's been coming on for months.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.685
-She asked me to help her.
-You didn't have to.

18:09.863 --> 18:12.696
What? If I didn't help her,
someone else would.

18:12.866 --> 18:16.666
-You can't stop life from happening.
-Well, I can sure slow it down a bit.

18:16.837 --> 18:21.103
-Oh, yeah, how?
-How? Total control. Total control.

18:21.274 --> 18:23.572
No boy comes here
and takes my daughter out...

18:23.744 --> 18:27.077
...unless I know who he is, where
he lives, who his parents are...

18:27.247 --> 18:30.444
...what they do for a living,
where they go, for how long...

18:30.617 --> 18:33.450
...and who they're gonna be with.
Total control.

18:33.620 --> 18:38.250
-That's brilliant, Doug. Good luck.
-Total! Total!

18:42.663 --> 18:45.257
Dad! Door!

18:47.534 --> 18:50.059
Oh, Brian. Nice of you to stop by.

18:50.637 --> 18:54.164
I know you're the best running back
in the history of Wheeler High...

18:54.341 --> 18:57.435
...and I'd sure hate to run into you
in a dark alley.

18:57.611 --> 19:01.206
But two speeding tickets in one year.
I'm sorry.

19:01.815 --> 19:03.806
Get hold of yourself.

19:14.127 --> 19:16.595
-Hello.
<i>-Mr. Simpson, is Katie there?</i>

19:16.763 --> 19:18.526
-Katie?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

19:18.699 --> 19:23.159
Brian, no, Katie can't come
to the phone now.

19:23.403 --> 19:25.837
Brian, stop crying.

19:50.897 --> 19:52.159
I'm home.

19:53.333 --> 19:54.823
Get the phone.

19:55.001 --> 19:56.764
I got the phone.

19:56.937 --> 20:00.839
Get the door. Total control.
The door.

20:01.007 --> 20:02.338
Take a message.

20:02.509 --> 20:04.306
<i>-My name is Steve.</i>
<i>-Total.</i>

20:04.478 --> 20:06.639
<i>-Hi. Tom.</i>
<i>-Total control.</i>

20:06.813 --> 20:09.247
<i>-Hello. This is Paul.</i>
<i>-Hi, I'm Will.</i>

20:09.416 --> 20:11.111
Dad! Door!

20:11.284 --> 20:14.344
<i>My name is Bobby.</i>

20:14.521 --> 20:16.455
<i>Hi, I'm Doug.</i>

20:16.957 --> 20:18.686
-Hi, Mr. Simpson.
-Look...

20:18.859 --> 20:22.590
...before you say anything, I want you
to know I marched in Selma in 1967.

20:22.763 --> 20:26.961
I was the third guy pulled out of the
lunch counter in Montgomery in 1968.

20:27.300 --> 20:29.700
I have no idea what
you're talking about, sir.

20:29.870 --> 20:34.967
I'm here to deliver your water.
I'm your new Sparkletts man. Leroy!

20:37.544 --> 20:39.034
Leroy.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.941
I guess I had that coming.

20:47.888 --> 20:49.321
<i>-Kyle.</i>
<i>-Mickey.</i>

20:49.489 --> 20:50.854
<i>-I'm Perry.</i>
<i>-I'm Sonny.</i>

20:51.024 --> 20:52.514
<i>-My name's Ted.</i>
<i>-Lyle.</i>

20:52.692 --> 20:55.126
<i>-Vestor.</i>
<i>-Hi, I'm Stoker.</i>

21:02.202 --> 21:03.726
That's it.

21:05.939 --> 21:07.429
Twins.

21:08.408 --> 21:09.875
Total.

21:10.243 --> 21:12.268
Total control.

21:14.915 --> 21:17.907
Doug, those are the new ratings.

21:18.084 --> 21:22.248
We're down to number 9 and sliding.
I don't know what the hell's happened.

21:22.422 --> 21:25.289
Well, what's wrong
with being number 9?

21:25.458 --> 21:28.154
Why are we talking numbers?

21:28.395 --> 21:31.558
Eighty-nine other stations
would love to be number 9.

21:32.165 --> 21:34.599
You have your finger
on the pulse of the kids.

21:34.768 --> 21:38.135
Now, come up with something,
like the competition.

21:38.305 --> 21:42.264
A sex therapy talk show.
Date with a rock 'n' roll star.

21:42.442 --> 21:45.969
-Topless bikini beach contest.
-That's a great idea.

21:46.146 --> 21:47.875
But not for us.

21:49.783 --> 21:54.743
Mr. Simpson, I finally got through on
that important phone call. It's line 4.

21:55.055 --> 21:56.545
Thank you, Martha.
Excuse me.

21:56.723 --> 21:58.714
I think the market's hot
on Gypsy music.

21:58.892 --> 22:00.985
Bonnie, what's happening?
Who called?

22:01.161 --> 22:04.790
-No one, Dad. It's really quiet here.
-Well, quiet's good, right?

22:04.965 --> 22:08.765
Not that kind of quiet.
Strange quiet. Eerie quiet.

22:08.935 --> 22:12.701
<i>Why would all the calls stop? It's like</i>
<i>she doesn't live here anymore.</i>

22:12.873 --> 22:16.365
Oh, she lives here, all right.
At least till Sunday.

22:16.543 --> 22:21.037
<i>-She's got a date for the beach.</i>
-Oh, well. Anything else happen?

22:21.214 --> 22:24.809
-Well, I did see her report card.
-What?

22:31.491 --> 22:36.019
An A-minus in English.
A B-plus in American history.

22:36.196 --> 22:39.324
And a B, no plus, in geometry.

22:40.133 --> 22:43.000
Dad, I'll bounce back in finals.
I always do.

22:43.169 --> 22:48.072
I won't make a big deal out of this,
but let me leave you with one thought.

22:48.241 --> 22:52.439
A mind, a good mind,
is a terrible thing to waste.

22:52.612 --> 22:54.409
So's a good body.

22:57.550 --> 23:00.110
Funny. So funny I forgot to laugh.

23:00.287 --> 23:03.381
You know something?
When a father gets close to his kids...

23:03.556 --> 23:07.424
...I mean, too close, nature has
a way of helping the father out.

23:07.594 --> 23:10.995
The kids become really obnoxious.

23:18.405 --> 23:20.066
Thanks a lot.

23:20.240 --> 23:23.505
I didn't say anything about
your marks. It's all over town.

23:23.677 --> 23:29.411
Oh, sure. Remember, some day
this'll be happening to you.

23:30.116 --> 23:32.550
-It can't be.
-Better not be.

23:42.929 --> 23:44.157
-Dad?
-I'm here...

23:44.331 --> 23:46.424
...because I want a date
with my daughter.

23:46.599 --> 23:49.067
I'm willing to wait in line
like everyone else.

23:49.235 --> 23:51.533
-Dad, that's very cute.
-No, no, I don't--

23:51.705 --> 23:55.232
Look in that book, Bonnie,
and make a commitment.

23:55.408 --> 23:58.400
-Listen, how's Thursday?
-Dad, I'm busy. I'm sorry.

23:58.578 --> 24:00.102
-Friday?
-Dad, I can't.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.544
-Saturday?
-Dad, I'm sorry.

24:02.716 --> 24:06.777
Sunday? Sunday, please?
Give me Sunday. I want Sunday.

24:06.953 --> 24:09.217
What am I doing Sunday?

24:09.389 --> 24:13.655
-Okay. Okay. Cancel it.
-Oh, thank you. Thank you.

24:26.106 --> 24:29.405
-Dad, I gotta go.
-No, wait, wait, wait.

25:05.078 --> 25:07.603
-Who was that?
-Him.

25:07.781 --> 25:10.978
-Him who?
-Oh, some kid. His name's Joey.

25:11.151 --> 25:15.554
I didn't meet any Joey. How come
I didn't meet him? You know the rules.

25:15.722 --> 25:20.318
Katie was afraid you'd frighten him.
He's shy. He's an artist, kind of.

25:20.493 --> 25:23.587
-What do you mean, he paints?
-No, he's a musician.

25:23.763 --> 25:26.323
-What kind of musician? Rock?
-I don't know.

25:26.499 --> 25:27.966
-Classical?
-I don't know.

25:28.134 --> 25:29.761
-Rhythm and blues?
-I don't know.

25:29.936 --> 25:32.496
What do you mean?
Why don't you know? Be specific.

25:32.672 --> 25:36.267
What are you here for?
Why am I paying you?

25:51.424 --> 25:54.257
Guys and girls, it's chow time.

25:54.427 --> 25:57.157
-Where have you been?
-You're lucky I made it back.

25:57.330 --> 26:00.857
There's a hamburger for you.
And a hot dog for Miss Bonnie.

26:01.034 --> 26:04.834
-Wait a minute. Where's Katie?
-She's in the water.

26:05.004 --> 26:07.404
-Don't eat.
-She'll be right back, Doug.

26:07.574 --> 26:11.977
No, no, no, no. This is my Sunday.
We eat together.

26:12.245 --> 26:13.473
Don't eat.

26:22.322 --> 26:24.950
Junk food's best when eaten hot.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.286
You're absolutely right.

26:40.473 --> 26:43.465
Katie! Katie!

26:58.358 --> 26:59.757
Hi, Dad.

26:59.993 --> 27:02.757
Who was that boy?
Was that that Joey kid?

27:02.929 --> 27:06.387
The kid with the flying saucer truck?
I saw the earring.

27:06.566 --> 27:09.933
You couldn't make a date with me.
You had to sneak a boyfriend in?

27:10.103 --> 27:13.300
When I broke the date, he thought
I was dating some other guy.

27:13.473 --> 27:15.668
He followed me here.

27:15.842 --> 27:18.174
Men are so insecure.

27:18.611 --> 27:20.670
-Hi, Katie.
-Hi.

27:20.847 --> 27:25.284
Would you stop bouncing, please?
And for God's sake, cover yourself.

27:26.386 --> 27:28.081
Here, put this on.

27:28.254 --> 27:31.849
Dad, I'm dressed like everyone else.
What's the matter with you?

27:32.025 --> 27:35.426
You're acting like every man
on this beach is after my body.

27:35.595 --> 27:37.893
--after my body.
--after my body.

28:05.124 --> 28:08.025
What are you looking at?
Get back to your blankets.

28:08.194 --> 28:12.324
-Get off my case, you old blob.
-Yeah, get out of the way.

28:12.498 --> 28:16.332
"Old blob"? "Get out of the way"?
Come here. Come here.

28:16.502 --> 28:19.596
-Dad!
-Run for your life! Help!

28:22.242 --> 28:24.005
Dad?

28:25.011 --> 28:27.104
-Doug?
-Run!

28:28.948 --> 28:30.415
Dad!

28:30.583 --> 28:30.750
<i>Dad!</i>

28:30.750 --> 28:31.842
<i>Dad!</i>

28:32.151 --> 28:33.778
<i>Dad!</i>

28:34.787 --> 28:36.220
I wouldn't have hurt him.

28:36.389 --> 28:39.290
Not that he didn't have it coming,
the little creep.

28:39.459 --> 28:43.896
I mean, I know exactly what was on
his dirty little 12-year-old mind.

28:44.063 --> 28:47.658
After all,
I was 12 years old once myself.

28:47.834 --> 28:50.359
That's what Janet didn't understand
when she told me...

28:50.536 --> 28:53.061
...to seek psychiatric help
before it was too late.

28:53.239 --> 28:56.265
Janet was never a 12-year-old boy.

28:56.442 --> 29:00.640
Look, I've read a little Freud,
Adler, Jung, and that book--

29:00.813 --> 29:04.249
What's it called,
<i>You're Okay, I'm Okay</i> ?

29:04.817 --> 29:06.614
I'm not stupid.

29:06.786 --> 29:10.051
I went to college for a year and a half.
Almost two.

29:10.223 --> 29:14.091
So when Janet said "irrational,"
I think she meant "abnormal."

29:14.260 --> 29:15.488
What do you think?

29:15.662 --> 29:18.631
The word that comes
to my mind is "normal."

29:20.166 --> 29:21.758
Really?

29:21.934 --> 29:26.462
You see, Mr. Simpson, you're standing
in the center of a sexual explosion.

29:27.340 --> 29:32.744
There are 9.5 million women in the
U.S. between the ages of 15 and 19.

29:32.912 --> 29:35.904
And approximately 47 percent
of those young women...

29:36.082 --> 29:39.074
...have already had sexual intercourse.

29:40.653 --> 29:46.091
Wait a minute, then. That leaves
53 percent who are still virgins.

29:46.259 --> 29:49.194
And thank God
my Katie's one of those.

29:49.729 --> 29:52.391
Not necessarily, Mr. Simpson.

29:52.598 --> 29:58.867
You see, 97 percent of that 53 percent
are just lying about it.

29:59.038 --> 30:02.530
Well, God, doctor,
what's happening to these girls?

30:02.709 --> 30:07.271
It's boys that are happening
to these girls, Mr. Simpson.

30:07.947 --> 30:10.848
Do you have any idea how often
the average teenage boy...

30:11.017 --> 30:12.848
...thinks about sex in a day?

30:13.019 --> 30:16.455
I don't know, 15, 20 times a day?

30:16.622 --> 30:20.752
Six hundred and fifty-two
times in one day.

30:22.295 --> 30:25.093
Look, doctor, I don't want
to see my Katie get hurt.

30:25.264 --> 30:27.391
She's not ready to deal,
emotionally...

30:27.567 --> 30:30.127
...with what's happening
to her, physically.

30:30.303 --> 30:31.793
She won't have to.

30:31.971 --> 30:35.338
With my help, if you
choose to take it...

30:35.508 --> 30:40.104
...you both have a good chance of
getting through this difficult period.

30:40.279 --> 30:42.213
Oh, I hope so.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.441
Just trust me, Mr. Simpson.

30:44.617 --> 30:48.109
Now, the first thing that you
have to do is read this.

30:49.555 --> 30:52.820
<i>"Daddy's Little Girl: A Guide to</i>
<i>Raising Your Teenage Daughter...</i>

30:52.992 --> 30:56.393
...by Dr. Herman Fishbinder."
That's you.

30:57.196 --> 30:59.687
It's in its fifth printing.

30:59.866 --> 31:01.697
Coming out in paperback in June.

31:02.335 --> 31:04.735
-Nice picture.
-Thank you.

31:04.904 --> 31:08.067
Start at the beginning.
Read it carefully.

31:08.875 --> 31:12.367
It just possibly has all the answers
to your problems.

31:12.545 --> 31:15.776
But you can call me any hour of
the day, if you have a question.

31:15.948 --> 31:18.348
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Fishbinder.

31:18.851 --> 31:20.682
-Oh, just one more thing.
-Yeah?

31:20.853 --> 31:24.619
Just in case you're a slow reader,
better put your daughter on the pill.

31:25.558 --> 31:27.150
What?

31:27.326 --> 31:28.588
Right away.

31:53.186 --> 31:57.350
"Taking responsibility for the sexual
education of your daughter.

31:57.523 --> 32:01.323
Don't count on your daughter getting a
good sexual education in school.

32:01.494 --> 32:03.587
Don't count on her to
be frank with you...

32:03.763 --> 32:09.065
...about the first sexual stirrings
within her." What can I count on?

32:09.235 --> 32:12.295
"But if your daughter should ask
you a question about sex...

32:12.472 --> 32:17.273
...discuss it with her in a calm, rational
and nonthreatening manner.

32:17.443 --> 32:22.107
For suggested responses,
see appendix C."

32:30.990 --> 32:33.754
"Five hundred years ago
a boy 16 years old...

32:33.926 --> 32:38.124
...would come to your door
with a flock of sheep."

32:54.547 --> 32:57.880
Oh, sweetheart.
I didn't hear you come in.

32:58.050 --> 33:01.713
Dad, I have had
the most wonderful...

33:01.888 --> 33:05.380
...glorious, fabulous time of my life.

33:05.558 --> 33:09.016
Oh, that's terrific.
Maybe sometime we'll talk about it.

33:09.195 --> 33:11.925
-Dad?
-Yes?

33:12.098 --> 33:14.430
I was wondering if we could
talk about it now?

33:14.600 --> 33:16.227
Oh, now? Sure.

33:16.402 --> 33:20.065
What am I here for, huh?
Come on, let's sit down.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.202
Here you go.

33:30.449 --> 33:34.749
If you're really interested in a guy....

33:34.921 --> 33:37.116
I was wondering, well....

33:37.290 --> 33:42.091
When do you know when
it's the right time to...?

33:42.261 --> 33:44.388
When do you know
when it's right to have--?

33:44.564 --> 33:46.225
Katie...

33:48.768 --> 33:53.296
...500 years ago a boy 16 years old
would come to the door...

33:53.472 --> 33:54.905
...with a flock of sheep.

33:55.074 --> 33:58.475
And he'd ask for your hand
in marriage.

33:58.644 --> 34:01.545
You'd have kids by 16
and be dead by 23.

34:01.714 --> 34:04.012
That was the average life span then.

34:04.183 --> 34:08.949
I mean, today, with vitamins and
organ transplants and penicillin...

34:09.121 --> 34:11.146
...you'll probably live to be 90.

34:11.324 --> 34:15.726
So at 15, even though you're
feeling this biological urge...

34:15.895 --> 34:18.864
...by the way, which is
normal and healthy...

34:19.498 --> 34:24.458
...medical science and God has
given you time, has allowed you...

34:24.637 --> 34:29.040
...a lot of time to make
this kind of a decision.

34:29.208 --> 34:32.574
And when it happens,
it'll be special.

34:32.745 --> 34:35.213
It'll be beautiful.

34:35.380 --> 34:36.643
So don't rush it.

34:47.360 --> 34:50.726
I hope I've shed some light
on this subject for you.

34:52.398 --> 34:55.833
Yeah, Dad.
I know what to do now.

34:59.038 --> 35:00.266
Wait a minute now.

35:00.439 --> 35:03.431
Would you mind telling me
what that might be?

35:03.609 --> 35:06.009
To make my own decisions.

35:06.178 --> 35:10.410
And never, ever
ask my dad a question...

35:10.583 --> 35:14.075
...he doesn't have the guts
to answer. Night, Dad.

35:28.567 --> 35:31.400
What's going on? You call me
at 3, 4, 5 in the morning.

35:31.570 --> 35:34.038
-I have a patient to see.
-Something happened.

35:34.206 --> 35:37.266
-Something wrong with the book?
-Oh, no. The book was right.

35:37.443 --> 35:38.671
This is my problem.

35:38.844 --> 35:41.779
My daughter asked me a question,
and I couldn't handle it.

35:41.947 --> 35:46.145
-Of course, you know what question.
-Oh, yes.

35:46.519 --> 35:49.920
What father can answer such a
question? I was set back a bit.

35:50.089 --> 35:56.119
I'm okay because I kept on reading
the book, and I came to chapter 15.

35:56.295 --> 35:59.321
The mother substitute.
A friend, a girlfriend, a lover...

35:59.498 --> 36:02.467
...someone who can fill the absence
of the original mother.

36:02.635 --> 36:05.126
Yes. Exactly.
Now, I have one of those.

36:05.304 --> 36:09.263
-And better yet, I love her.
-So move her in.

36:12.578 --> 36:15.103
Move her in.

36:15.281 --> 36:18.717
-Well, yeah, yeah.
-Don't the children like her?

36:18.884 --> 36:22.615
Yes, they do. They don't love her
the way I love her, but they love her.

36:22.788 --> 36:26.280
-So?
-It's just that you don't know Janet.

36:26.459 --> 36:30.259
I don't think I could just move her in.
I'd probably have to marry her.

36:30.429 --> 36:34.195
-Do you have a problem with that?
-Marriage? I don't know.

36:34.366 --> 36:37.062
I've done it once before,
and it changes everything.

36:37.236 --> 36:38.464
It's a big step.

36:38.637 --> 36:42.368
Mr. Simpson, maybe the problem
you have is not between you...

36:42.541 --> 36:46.443
...and your daughter,
but between you and Janet.

36:46.912 --> 36:50.814
-So would you like to talk about that?
-No, I have no problem with Janet.

36:52.151 --> 36:55.018
Then take charge. Act now.

37:00.459 --> 37:02.051
-Hello.
<i>-Doug?</i>

37:02.228 --> 37:04.196
Oh, Jeff, how are you?

37:04.363 --> 37:08.060
Are you crazy? You never came back
to the office today. What happened?

37:08.234 --> 37:11.692
I had to do some shopping.
Some very heavy shopping.

37:11.871 --> 37:14.101
Doug, the overnights are in.

37:14.273 --> 37:15.535
We're down to 12.

37:16.041 --> 37:18.475
<i>Our asses are sinking</i>
<i>into the sunset.</i>

37:19.111 --> 37:20.669
Stop shopping.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.990
-Hi.
-Hi.

37:43.135 --> 37:46.070
-Okay, hold it right there.
-What?

37:47.173 --> 37:50.540
-You look beautiful. You look terrific.
-Oh, thank you.

37:50.709 --> 37:52.006
Perfect...

37:52.178 --> 37:55.477
-...for what I'm about to do.
-No, don't start Doug.

37:55.648 --> 37:58.242
It took me an hour to get
into this dress...

37:58.417 --> 38:00.851
...and I'm not gonna take it off now.

38:01.620 --> 38:05.249
Champagne wishes
and caviar dreams.

38:34.420 --> 38:37.253
I always wanted you to do this.

38:38.858 --> 38:41.053
-You didn't have to, you know?
-Oh, I know.

38:41.227 --> 38:43.923
That's why I did it,
because I love you.

38:45.764 --> 38:51.293
-Would you help me put it on?
-Oh. Allow me.

38:55.307 --> 38:59.300
-Bingo.
-I love you. I love you.

38:59.478 --> 39:03.107
-I love you. I love you so much.
-Easy. Your makeup, your dress.

39:03.282 --> 39:06.911
I don't care about that. All I care
about is you and me right now.

39:07.086 --> 39:09.611
We're going to dinner, and
then we'll have a good--

39:09.788 --> 39:13.315
-What are you doing with your hand?
-What does it feel like I'm doing?

39:13.492 --> 39:17.053
-Come on, get out of there, little fella.
-Little fella?

39:18.030 --> 39:21.522
Sex, sex, sex.
I mean, is that all women think about?

39:21.700 --> 39:25.466
I mean, wouldn't it be nice if we
waited at least until you said yes?

39:25.638 --> 39:29.506
Yes. Yes. I say yes.

39:30.609 --> 39:32.167
-Yes.
-Now, now, wait.

39:32.878 --> 39:35.972
Okay, all right, look.
Please, would you stop?

39:36.148 --> 39:37.376
What?

39:37.549 --> 39:41.041
I've got a lot on my mind.
It's a big decision I made today.

39:41.220 --> 39:45.020
We've got the rest of our lives
to make love. Pace yourself.

39:47.993 --> 39:49.392
You're right.

39:51.030 --> 39:52.759
Okay.

39:56.435 --> 39:58.562
Where are you going now?

39:58.737 --> 39:59.965
I don't know.

40:00.139 --> 40:03.631
I guess I'll take a cold shower
and start all over again.

40:05.377 --> 40:07.038
A shower.

40:07.212 --> 40:09.112
Well, I did it.

40:09.281 --> 40:13.012
And, hey, I love her.
I love her. Katie.

40:18.424 --> 40:20.654
I love her. I love her.

40:21.460 --> 40:22.688
I'll get it.

40:22.861 --> 40:24.761
-Hello?
<i>-Katie? Who is this?</i>

40:24.930 --> 40:27.899
Hey, does it matter?
Does it really matter?

40:29.802 --> 40:31.702
Who the--?

40:46.085 --> 40:47.609
Doug?

40:47.786 --> 40:49.845
Sweetheart?

40:51.256 --> 40:53.247
-Hello.
-Hi, honey.

40:53.425 --> 40:58.260
I'm very sorry, but while you were
in the shower, I got a call.

40:58.430 --> 41:02.730
<i>There's an emergency. I'll be at the</i>
<i>radio station for most of the night.</i>

41:02.901 --> 41:05.529
I'll call you as soon as I can.
I love you.

41:05.704 --> 41:08.764
And remember, the ring is real.

41:10.676 --> 41:12.439
It's real.

41:13.178 --> 41:14.907
Better be real.

41:25.057 --> 41:27.719
-Your name, sir.
-Well, see, I'm not really invited.

41:27.893 --> 41:30.293
I'm a patient of Dr. Fishbinder's.

41:30.462 --> 41:32.362
It's very important
that I see him.

41:32.531 --> 41:34.089
Are you on medication?

41:34.566 --> 41:36.796
-No, no.
-Remain in the vehicle, sir.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.668
Dr. Fishbinder, please.

41:48.514 --> 41:51.074
-Yes?
-Dr. Fishbinder, this is Doug.

41:51.250 --> 41:54.686
I know. I recognize the breathing.
How'd you get this address?

41:54.853 --> 41:57.344
I told the service
it was an emergency.

41:57.523 --> 41:59.548
They're fired!
Take it easy, Mr. Simpson.

41:59.725 --> 42:03.627
-I have to see you.
-That's impossible. I'm having a party.

42:03.796 --> 42:06.765
But I can see you.
Just talk to the camera.

42:06.932 --> 42:09.059
And I'm right here.

42:09.234 --> 42:12.761
<i>Dr. Fishbinder, I called home,</i>
<i>and a strange voice answered.</i>

42:12.938 --> 42:15.998
<i>I think it was that boy, Joey.</i>
<i>I want to break that little--</i>

42:16.175 --> 42:19.406
Now, take it easy, Mr. Simpson.
This is actually good news.

42:19.578 --> 42:22.979
Remember chapter 25,
Befriend the Enemy?

42:23.148 --> 42:27.016
If your daughter goes out with a boy
you find obnoxious, never say...

42:27.186 --> 42:31.953
...anything negative about him. That
will drive her straight into his arms.

42:32.124 --> 42:34.820
Instead, make yourself pals
of the boy...

42:34.993 --> 42:37.427
...and soon your daughter
will see him as you do.

42:37.596 --> 42:40.724
<i>-Are you sure?</i>
-Oh, no, I'm not sure.

42:40.899 --> 42:43.561
That's why I have a Rolls-Royce,
a home in Bel Air...

42:43.735 --> 42:47.796
...and a house in the south of France.
Of course I'm sure.

42:48.474 --> 42:51.637
<i>Now, act natural.</i>
<i>You're one of them.</i>

42:51.810 --> 42:57.680
<i>Remember, tonight that boy</i>
<i>must be your best friend.</i>

43:35.754 --> 43:38.552
Hi, kids. Playing charades?

43:38.724 --> 43:41.522
Let me guess.
<i>The Garden of Eden?</i>

43:41.693 --> 43:44.526
No, no.
<i>Dirty Dancing.</i>

43:44.696 --> 43:48.063
Dad, I'm sorry.
We found your old 45s...

43:48.233 --> 43:51.100
...and Joey wanted--
We thought they were funny and--

43:51.270 --> 43:53.204
Katie, Katie, no need
to explain to me.

43:53.372 --> 43:55.897
I did the same thing when
my parents were out.

43:56.074 --> 43:59.874
And when you guys have kids, they're
gonna do the same thing to you.

44:00.045 --> 44:02.673
Isn't that what life is all about?

44:02.848 --> 44:05.612
Oh, my God, Katie,
you have the coolest dad.

44:05.784 --> 44:08.912
You're so lucky, Katie.
Your dad is, like, killer.

44:11.056 --> 44:12.284
Oh, well....

44:12.457 --> 44:15.722
Dad, this is Joey.

44:15.894 --> 44:17.794
Oh. Joey.

44:18.497 --> 44:19.759
Pleasure to meet you.

44:19.932 --> 44:21.763
Nice to meet you.
I was just leaving.

44:21.934 --> 44:24.903
Wait a minute, Joey.
Don't go yet. The night is young.

44:25.070 --> 44:28.062
Come on, take your shades off.
Let your hair....

44:28.740 --> 44:30.640
Never mind. You want oldies?

44:30.809 --> 44:33.369
I got oldies.
Let me play some for you.

44:50.662 --> 44:54.598
Now, this one was banned
in Boston. Okay?

44:54.766 --> 44:57.735
The funny part is, the kids
didn't know how dirty it was...

44:57.903 --> 45:00.064
...until it was banned.

45:00.639 --> 45:04.131
It just goes to show you how uptight
some parents can be.

45:05.043 --> 45:06.908
I'm out of here. See you.

45:07.746 --> 45:09.941
Joey, wait a minute.
Joey, wait, wait.

45:10.115 --> 45:12.310
Leaving so soon?

45:12.484 --> 45:15.146
This is a very strange scene,
Mr. Simmons.

45:15.320 --> 45:19.381
It's Simpson. Just like my daughter.
What's so strange?

45:19.558 --> 45:24.518
How you're handling this whole thing.
It's just a little too good to be true.

45:24.696 --> 45:28.757
Most parents don't like kids.
No parents like me.

45:28.934 --> 45:31.596
How come you're so nice?

45:33.138 --> 45:38.974
Well, Joey, you may not believe this,
and I admit it does sound a little wild...

45:39.144 --> 45:42.807
...but you remind me of myself
when I was your age.

45:43.448 --> 45:46.975
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Well, you're a musician...

45:47.152 --> 45:50.610
...and a rebel and a loner. And
that's how I was when I was a kid.

45:50.789 --> 45:53.349
In fact, I understand
why Katie likes you.

45:59.531 --> 46:03.467
What do you say, gang? We go to one
of my old hangouts, and it's my treat.

46:05.304 --> 46:06.931
Let's go.

46:08.173 --> 46:09.868
There you go.

46:11.510 --> 46:14.001
Are you for real, Mr. Simpson?

46:14.179 --> 46:15.771
Am I for real, Joey?

46:15.947 --> 46:19.075
Did you happen to notice
my Jaguar outside?

46:28.994 --> 46:30.393
Come on.

46:54.019 --> 46:58.922
I met Mick Jagger backstage
after a Stones concert in 1969.

46:59.091 --> 47:02.492
Wow, you saw the Stones in '69?

47:02.661 --> 47:05.186
That was before I was born.

47:05.597 --> 47:07.064
You saw all the greats.

47:07.666 --> 47:08.894
Jagger.

47:09.067 --> 47:12.332
Lennon.
You actually saw Jim Morrison.

47:12.504 --> 47:15.371
Joey, I'm surprised that you
like that kind of music.

47:20.645 --> 47:23.079
-Hey, Joey.
-Oh, man.

47:23.248 --> 47:26.376
What did you do,
trade in your truck for that lemon?

47:26.551 --> 47:28.212
Come on, guys,
be cool, all right?

47:28.387 --> 47:32.118
So are we up for a drag, or is this car
of yours all show and no go?

47:32.290 --> 47:35.487
-Give me a break.
-Wait. Who are these clowns?

47:35.660 --> 47:38.254
-Let's just go, okay, Joe?
-Wait a minute.

47:38.430 --> 47:41.729
Dad, they're just a bunch of geeks
from school. Just ignore them.

47:41.900 --> 47:43.128
Ignore them?

47:43.835 --> 47:45.894
Yo, boys...

47:46.071 --> 47:50.838
...this happens to be a Jaguar XKE,
4.2 liter...

47:51.009 --> 47:53.807
...265 horsepower, which means...

47:53.979 --> 47:56.971
...Joey will meet you any time...

47:57.149 --> 48:00.346
...any place, at any distance.

48:02.521 --> 48:04.113
-Let's go.
-I will?

48:04.956 --> 48:07.424
Joey, you back down now,
where does it end?

48:08.393 --> 48:10.657
Right. The spot, now!

48:10.829 --> 48:13.161
All right!

48:13.498 --> 48:15.432
The spot? What spot?

48:42.060 --> 48:44.290
Hey, buddy, ready to get
your butts kicked?

48:44.763 --> 48:47.561
Good luck. You're gonna need it.

48:49.201 --> 48:52.568
Joey, I know that Corvette.
It's an animal.

48:52.737 --> 48:56.036
But we can win, Joey. We can
beat them. It's all in the driving.

48:56.208 --> 48:57.436
-Yeah.
-Okay. Look...

48:57.609 --> 49:01.409
...all you have to do is concentrate.
Get out fast, go through those gears.

49:01.580 --> 49:03.047
All right? You got it?

49:03.215 --> 49:05.513
-I got it.
-All right.

49:06.218 --> 49:07.879
-Mr. Simpson?
-Yeah, Joey?

49:08.053 --> 49:10.419
You are for real.

49:13.225 --> 49:14.886
Good luck, babe.

49:15.327 --> 49:17.261
All right, all right. That's enough.

49:17.429 --> 49:20.193
Go start the race. Good luck.

50:08.613 --> 50:11.275
All right, Joey!

50:11.449 --> 50:12.916
What am I doing here?

50:37.909 --> 50:40.377
-Sorry I stalled the car.
-Forget about it.

50:40.545 --> 50:42.809
-Did we destroy that Corvette or what?
-Yeah.

50:45.917 --> 50:48.943
Give me a hand.
I think I need a push. Come on.

50:55.193 --> 50:57.627
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

51:12.611 --> 51:15.011
That was close.

51:58.356 --> 52:01.883
I'm afraid we can't have it
for you today.

52:03.194 --> 52:04.821
We can give you a loaner.

52:04.996 --> 52:08.454
It's not comparable. But considering
what you did to your own car....

52:08.633 --> 52:09.998
Thank you.

52:10.168 --> 52:12.636
Come on, Dad. Come on.

52:21.346 --> 52:25.009
Dad, do you think machines
feel pain?

52:25.950 --> 52:29.545
What? What are you talking about?

52:30.355 --> 52:34.689
Well, there's this whole theory about
inanimate objects feeling pain.

52:34.859 --> 52:40.195
Katie, if you're worried about the car,
don't. That's what insurance is for.

52:40.365 --> 52:44.859
If you're worried about Joey,
it wasn't his fault, okay?

52:45.036 --> 52:46.901
You know, I don't know about that.

52:47.072 --> 52:50.405
I think it was symptomatic
of his whole immature personality.

52:50.575 --> 52:53.100
Now, wait a minute--
Wait a minute.

52:53.278 --> 52:55.906
What am I hearing here?

52:56.081 --> 52:59.710
Dad, you're gonna be terribly
disappointed, but I broke up with Joey.

52:59.884 --> 53:01.511
You broke--?

53:01.686 --> 53:06.055
You broke up with Joey?
I thought he was so important to you.

53:08.093 --> 53:11.426
Oh, set him up and
shoot him down, huh?

53:11.596 --> 53:14.588
-Who's next?
-Dad, what are you talking about?

53:14.766 --> 53:17.894
What am I talking about?
Take a good look, Katie.

53:18.069 --> 53:21.334
That cute, adorable face staring
back at you is not a weapon.

53:21.506 --> 53:23.940
Don't think of it as a weapon
because it's not.

53:24.109 --> 53:27.909
I mean, if it was a weapon,
it could backfire. Trust me.

53:28.780 --> 53:32.307
Dad, I'm sorry. It's just a phase
I'm going through, you know?

53:32.484 --> 53:34.975
I've never been as popular
with boys before.

53:35.153 --> 53:38.020
It's kind of a kick having this power.

53:39.991 --> 53:42.152
I'll be over it soon, I promise.

53:42.327 --> 53:44.818
I hope so.

53:44.996 --> 53:46.691
Now, who's the new guy?

53:48.032 --> 53:49.431
What new guy?

54:07.952 --> 54:09.817
I got it.

54:13.792 --> 54:15.089
Hi, Timothy--

54:15.260 --> 54:17.490
Joe--? Richard?

54:17.662 --> 54:18.890
Hi, Katie.

54:19.831 --> 54:24.495
Hi. What did you do to your hair?
And your clothes?

54:25.336 --> 54:28.066
I liked you fine the way you were.

54:28.239 --> 54:30.503
I didn't.

54:30.675 --> 54:33.872
Look, can I just talk
to your father for a second?

54:35.280 --> 54:37.680
Yeah, come in.

54:38.216 --> 54:39.877
Dad!

54:41.820 --> 54:44.220
Hi, Joey.

54:44.389 --> 54:48.223
Oh, Richard, how are you?

54:48.393 --> 54:52.523
Hi. Can I see you for a moment,
Mr. Simpson?

54:52.697 --> 54:55.666
Sure, sure.
Come on in the kitchen.

55:02.640 --> 55:05.541
Bonnie, could you excuse us
for a minute, sweetheart?

55:09.047 --> 55:10.537
Sorry.

55:11.683 --> 55:15.676
Well, there's brain damage,
but at least he's still breathing.

55:15.854 --> 55:17.788
So how've you been, pal?

55:17.956 --> 55:21.289
I just wanted to tell you,
Mr. Simpson...

55:21.459 --> 55:24.428
...I'm not going on the school trip
to Europe with Katie.

55:24.596 --> 55:26.826
Oh, come on, Richard.
Why? You should go.

55:26.998 --> 55:29.933
Look, Mr. Simpson...

55:30.101 --> 55:34.128
...I know that you were counting
on me to watch over Katie and all...

55:34.305 --> 55:38.639
...but if I go, you know, I mean,
I'll just be cramping her style.

55:40.111 --> 55:42.739
What if she meets a count?

55:42.914 --> 55:44.279
Or a duke?

55:44.449 --> 55:46.474
Or that Prince Charles guy?

55:46.651 --> 55:48.949
Richard, Prince Charles is married.

55:49.120 --> 55:50.712
Yeah.

55:50.889 --> 55:53.119
But not happily.

55:53.291 --> 55:56.727
Well, we don't know that for sure.

56:05.536 --> 56:08.061
Hi, Timothy-- Joey?

56:09.641 --> 56:11.541
What are you doing here?
We decided...

56:11.709 --> 56:14.269
...we weren't gonna see
each other for a while.

56:15.113 --> 56:16.774
I'm not here to see you, babe.

56:16.948 --> 56:19.644
I'm here to see your dad.
Is he around?

56:21.019 --> 56:24.648
Great. Yeah.

56:27.258 --> 56:29.089
Dad!

56:30.795 --> 56:33.787
-Joey, how are you?
-Hi.

56:33.965 --> 56:37.332
-Can we...?
-Yeah, yeah, sure. Right in here.

56:38.937 --> 56:42.703
Stretcher cases to the left.
Walking wounded to the right.

56:48.780 --> 56:51.271
One more guy in leather
we can start a rock group.

56:51.449 --> 56:53.314
Shut up.

56:54.152 --> 56:56.017
Who is it?

56:56.821 --> 56:58.812
Hi, Timothy.

57:01.759 --> 57:04.091
I can't believe it.

57:06.130 --> 57:08.325
I never thought Katie and me
would break up.

57:08.499 --> 57:11.491
-Joey, get ahold of yourself.
-You don't understand.

57:11.669 --> 57:13.694
My dad never liked me.

57:13.871 --> 57:16.169
No dad ever liked me till I met you.

57:16.341 --> 57:21.244
Joey, Joey. Come on, have a seat.
Sit down. Have a seat.

57:22.180 --> 57:24.011
-Katie dumped me.
-Yeah.

57:24.182 --> 57:26.480
Don't you dump me too.
Please, Mr. Simpson.

57:26.651 --> 57:29.176
Joey, I wouldn't do anything
like that.

57:29.354 --> 57:31.219
-You mean it?
-Of course.

57:31.389 --> 57:34.256
Because I was thinking,
maybe we could hang out together.

57:34.425 --> 57:37.053
I don't know. Maybe go
to a concert or something?

57:37.228 --> 57:41.892
Sure. Why not, why not?
Only next time we'll take the bus.

57:44.936 --> 57:46.597
Yeah.

57:48.106 --> 57:50.438
Daddy, this is very embarrassing.

57:50.608 --> 57:54.806
Timothy's here.
Can you get rid of these guys nicely?

57:54.979 --> 57:59.507
Yeah, nicely. Anyone else coming?
Because we're running out of rooms.

58:07.959 --> 58:09.950
She is a wonderful girl.

58:13.064 --> 58:15.794
Be smart.
Make friends with the old man.

58:31.149 --> 58:32.741
Thank you, sweetheart.

58:35.053 --> 58:37.886
Oh, thank you.
Bonnie, isn't it?

58:40.224 --> 58:43.853
So how did you two kids meet?
You have classes together at school?

58:44.028 --> 58:47.657
Oh, no, I wish we did. I'm a senior.

58:47.832 --> 58:50.096
Thank you, Bonnie.

58:50.268 --> 58:52.498
We met at a philosophy
seminar after school.

58:52.670 --> 58:56.504
We had a very interesting discussion
about inanimate objects.

58:58.309 --> 59:02.109
Does this mean you'll be going
away to college in the fall?

59:02.914 --> 59:06.077
Timothy is going to attend Yale.

59:06.250 --> 59:09.481
-Oh, Yale.
-Yes, my father's quite angry with me.

59:09.654 --> 59:13.351
Both he and my grandfather went to
Princeton, and I've disappointed them.

59:14.692 --> 59:16.523
Princeton. Both.

59:17.728 --> 59:23.132
We're off. Maurice won't hold our
table much longer. Even for me.

59:23.301 --> 59:26.793
Oh, well, let's not keep
Maurice waiting.

59:26.971 --> 59:28.495
Have a nice time.

59:28.673 --> 59:30.868
-Good night, Daddy.
-Good night, sweetheart.

59:31.042 --> 59:34.102
Good night, Bonnie.

59:34.278 --> 59:35.973
Oh, I almost forgot.

59:36.147 --> 59:38.342
Here's the phone number
of the restaurant...

59:38.516 --> 59:42.509
...and the number of my parents'. We'll
be there for a cappuccino after dinner.

59:42.687 --> 59:45.485
Just make sure she's home by 12.

59:45.656 --> 59:49.615
I assure you, sir,
it'll be more like 11.

59:50.528 --> 59:52.928
-Good night, sir.
-Good night, Timothy.

59:53.097 --> 59:55.565
-Good night, Daddy.
-Good night, sweetheart.

59:55.733 --> 59:57.325
Drive safe.

59:57.502 --> 59:59.493
Bye-bye.

01:00:00.972 --> 01:00:03.463
What do you think, Dad?
Perfect, right?

01:00:03.641 --> 01:00:06.235
Yeah. Wow.

01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:10.642
Yale. The number of the restaurant.

01:00:10.815 --> 01:00:15.047
Home by 11. Perfect. At last--

01:00:17.788 --> 01:00:19.187
Wait a minute.

01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:24.523
Chapter 52. He's too perfect.

01:00:25.963 --> 01:00:31.299
Of course, chapter 52.
A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing.

01:00:31.469 --> 01:00:34.495
This is the most dangerous
of the Don Juan...

01:00:34.672 --> 01:00:37.607
...Casanova, Warren Beatty species.

01:00:38.676 --> 01:00:44.046
Your daughter is in grave danger from
a formidable predator, Mr. Simpson.

01:00:45.449 --> 01:00:47.041
Just tell me what to do.

01:00:47.218 --> 01:00:50.813
Didn't you read the next chapter?
Surveillance?

01:00:51.055 --> 01:00:54.513
Wait a minute.
You want me to spy on Timothy?

01:00:54.692 --> 01:00:56.421
Well, even if I could...

01:00:56.594 --> 01:01:00.462
...I mean, anything that I said to Katie
would just be my word against his.

01:01:00.631 --> 01:01:02.622
Do you own a camera, Mr. Simpson?

01:01:03.801 --> 01:01:06.964
I suggest a Tri-X 1000 for day...

01:01:07.138 --> 01:01:12.599
...and infrared with a 2.4 lens
for night.

01:01:25.356 --> 01:01:27.381
Good shot.

01:01:34.732 --> 01:01:36.324
Gotcha.

01:01:55.319 --> 01:01:56.911
Gotcha.

01:02:24.882 --> 01:02:27.442
Gotcha. You'll never be president.

01:02:56.747 --> 01:02:58.442
Katie?

01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:02.983
Sweetheart?

01:03:07.358 --> 01:03:09.019
Katie?

01:03:11.629 --> 01:03:13.119
Bonnie.

01:03:13.297 --> 01:03:15.197
Bonnie, wake up, wake up.

01:03:15.366 --> 01:03:19.063
Where's Katie? Where is she? Get
your book and find out where she is.

01:03:19.236 --> 01:03:22.501
I don't need my book, Dad.
She's with Timothy at the beach.

01:03:22.673 --> 01:03:25.506
-Go to bed.
-Thank you.

01:03:29.613 --> 01:03:31.478
Katie, what are you--?

01:03:31.849 --> 01:03:33.510
Doug...

01:03:34.318 --> 01:03:37.412
...we're down to 34 in the ratings.

01:03:37.788 --> 01:03:39.653
For the love of God...

01:03:39.824 --> 01:03:42.088
...do something before they can us.

01:03:42.259 --> 01:03:45.251
-Jeff, a lot of other--
-Doug, no!

01:03:46.797 --> 01:03:51.962
Don't say, "A lot of stations
would love to be number 34."

01:03:52.136 --> 01:03:56.300
If you say, "A lot of stations would
love to be number 34"...

01:03:56.474 --> 01:03:58.305
...I will kill you.

01:03:58.976 --> 01:04:00.705
Understand?

01:04:00.878 --> 01:04:03.472
I'll get back to you.

01:04:07.418 --> 01:04:08.817
<i>"Discipline.</i>

01:04:08.986 --> 01:04:12.114
<i>Discipline is a key word</i>
<i>in every father's vocabulary.</i>

01:04:12.923 --> 01:04:16.154
<i>You are the parent.</i>
<i>You set the rules.</i>

01:04:16.327 --> 01:04:17.794
<i>You are in control.</i>

01:04:17.962 --> 01:04:21.898
<i>If the rules are broken, it is</i>
<i>your duty to punish accordingly.</i>

01:04:22.433 --> 01:04:24.924
<i>You must enforce the rules.</i>

01:04:25.102 --> 01:04:28.663
<i>You are the enforcer. "</i>

01:04:41.652 --> 01:04:43.586
Where were you?

01:04:43.754 --> 01:04:47.281
What have you been doing,
and I want the truth.

01:04:49.093 --> 01:04:52.927
I was at the beach with Timothy.
I guess I forgot the time.

01:04:53.097 --> 01:04:55.497
-I'm sorry.
-Let me tell you what time it is.

01:04:55.666 --> 01:04:57.793
It's 4:00 in the morning.

01:04:57.968 --> 01:05:00.960
Now, I had no idea
things had gone this far.

01:05:01.172 --> 01:05:02.639
You're grounded.

01:05:02.807 --> 01:05:04.035
Grounded? For how long?

01:05:04.208 --> 01:05:06.039
For the rest of your life.

01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:08.940
And that means no phones,
no dates, no nothing.

01:05:09.113 --> 01:05:13.709
Dad, Timothy's prom
is in two weeks.

01:05:13.884 --> 01:05:17.911
Then I go away to Europe.
He goes away to school.

01:05:18.489 --> 01:05:20.320
How could you do this to me?

01:05:21.892 --> 01:05:24.690
I could tell you things
about your precious Timothy.

01:05:25.596 --> 01:05:28.827
Look, let's just say I'm doing this
for your own good, okay?

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.031
Now, wait a minute...

01:05:31.202 --> 01:05:34.365
...if you did something tonight--
And I'm not saying you did...

01:05:34.538 --> 01:05:37.098
...and I hope you didn't.
But if you did...

01:05:37.274 --> 01:05:38.901
...it should have been special.

01:05:39.076 --> 01:05:41.374
It should have been
beautiful and special.

01:05:41.545 --> 01:05:44.537
There is nothing beautiful or special
that ends with you...

01:05:44.715 --> 01:05:47.684
...climbing in a window
at 4:00 in the morning.

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:53.212
-Now, go to your room.
-I'm in my room.

01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:55.449
Then stay here.

01:06:00.698 --> 01:06:02.165
I don't need these.

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:04.725
I'm the enforcer.

01:06:17.548 --> 01:06:18.981
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:06:19.149 --> 01:06:21.674
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:06:21.852 --> 01:06:24.252
What's this?

01:06:29.693 --> 01:06:30.921
What's this?

01:06:31.095 --> 01:06:33.928
I didn't want my father to see
your things at my place.

01:06:34.098 --> 01:06:38.831
Heaven forbid he should see my razor,
my toothbrush and my lndian robe.

01:06:39.003 --> 01:06:40.834
Come on, Janet,
you're a grown woman.

01:06:41.005 --> 01:06:45.203
I know, I know, but after all,
I'm still his daughter.

01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:47.708
You know about fathers
and daughters.

01:06:47.978 --> 01:06:50.276
Well, just follow the
sad music up the stairs.

01:06:58.055 --> 01:07:00.717
You know, I'm really--

01:07:08.866 --> 01:07:11.960
I'm really angry at you, young lady.
Hey, wait a minute.

01:07:12.136 --> 01:07:14.696
Look at me when I talk to you.

01:07:14.872 --> 01:07:17.773
You begged me to help you,
and I did. Now I feel like...

01:07:17.942 --> 01:07:20.240
...a total and complete jerk.

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:22.606
I guess you hate me too.

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:24.611
I don't hate--

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.887
I don't hate you. I just feel your
behavior is getting out of hand.

01:07:33.057 --> 01:07:36.049
I mean, all you care about
now is boys, boys, boys.

01:07:36.226 --> 01:07:39.491
Your grades are slipping.
You sneak in your window at 4.

01:07:39.663 --> 01:07:40.994
Driving your father crazy.

01:07:41.165 --> 01:07:44.430
Maybe you don't care about
what you're doing to him, but I do.

01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:46.092
I'm sorry.

01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:49.171
Okay, baby, it's okay.

01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:51.535
Stop crying. Come on.

01:07:51.709 --> 01:07:53.904
Hey, I'm a woman. Remember?

01:07:54.078 --> 01:07:56.308
That only works on men.

01:07:58.549 --> 01:08:02.076
Come on, tell me
how I can help you.

01:08:03.654 --> 01:08:05.986
So that's it.

01:08:06.156 --> 01:08:10.149
I'm the enforcer, and when
I say something in my house...

01:08:10.327 --> 01:08:12.227
-...they do it.
-Good, good.

01:08:12.396 --> 01:08:15.058
You're finally in control
of your life again.

01:08:15.232 --> 01:08:16.790
Yeah, and my daughter is safe.

01:08:16.966 --> 01:08:19.800
And Timothy is leaving town.

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:23.736
She's just gonna see him
one more time, on prom night.

01:08:23.907 --> 01:08:25.238
What did you say?

01:08:25.408 --> 01:08:28.537
She's gonna see him once more,
at prom. I promised Janet.

01:08:28.712 --> 01:08:30.111
Prom night?

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:33.908
Prom night?
Did I hear you say "prom night"?

01:08:34.385 --> 01:08:36.353
Just one more time.
It's no big deal.

01:08:36.819 --> 01:08:39.220
Didn't you read the book?

01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:41.821
Look at this.

01:08:41.992 --> 01:08:47.930
"81.5 percent of American girls
lose their virginity on prom night."

01:08:48.098 --> 01:08:50.965
It's in the book.
It is in the book.

01:08:51.135 --> 01:08:54.366
-In the book.
-Eighty-one....

01:08:55.038 --> 01:08:59.169
All right. All the work we've
done here is down the drain.

01:08:59.343 --> 01:09:00.935
I'm giving you your money back.

01:09:01.111 --> 01:09:04.877
My secretary will send you a check.
Now, get out!

01:09:06.283 --> 01:09:08.274
Prom night, of course.

01:09:08.452 --> 01:09:09.817
Wait a minute.

01:09:09.987 --> 01:09:12.319
Wait a minute.
Doctor, look, look, look...

01:09:12.488 --> 01:09:15.252
...I'm the enforcer, right?
I can handle this.

01:09:15.426 --> 01:09:17.587
I will call off prom night.

01:09:18.194 --> 01:09:21.926
Dr. Fishbinder, I give you my word.
It's off.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.965
-That was a close one.
-I know.

01:09:26.136 --> 01:09:28.434
Don't do that again.

01:09:29.206 --> 01:09:31.106
Doctor, I'm sorry.

01:09:32.509 --> 01:09:34.533
Are you okay?
Is there anything I can do?

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:38.203
No, I'm all right.
That's what I'm here for.

01:09:38.982 --> 01:09:41.883
But it's just so frustrating
when you try to help....

01:09:44.654 --> 01:09:48.091
Wait a minute. Maybe there is
something you can do for me.

01:09:48.258 --> 01:09:51.352
-Name it. Anything.
-Don't you work at a radio station?

01:09:51.528 --> 01:09:53.086
Yeah. KHEY Radio.

01:09:53.263 --> 01:09:54.491
Well, maybe--

01:09:54.665 --> 01:09:58.101
Maybe if you had some airtime
available on your station...

01:09:58.268 --> 01:10:01.795
...maybe I could help all the other
Doug Simpsons who are out there.

01:10:01.972 --> 01:10:03.997
What do you think?

01:10:04.174 --> 01:10:06.039
I think it sounds like a good idea.

01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:09.976
I mean, after all, you certainly helped
this Doug Simpson.

01:10:10.147 --> 01:10:12.479
It'd be almost like public service.
Here.

01:10:12.649 --> 01:10:14.412
You call this number.

01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:18.021
You ask for Jeff Roberts.
He's my assistant at the station.

01:10:18.188 --> 01:10:21.351
-And you're on the air.
-Great.

01:10:21.792 --> 01:10:25.751
Now, remember, the important
thing is, for God's sake...

01:10:25.929 --> 01:10:28.397
...put an end to prom night.

01:10:28.565 --> 01:10:30.795
Yes, I will.

01:10:30.968 --> 01:10:34.665
-Same time next week?
-Of course.

01:10:34.838 --> 01:10:37.170
-Mr. Simpson.
-Yeah?

01:10:37.841 --> 01:10:39.775
You're my favorite patient.

01:10:49.453 --> 01:10:51.512
There he is, right there.

01:11:01.131 --> 01:11:02.826
Good evening.

01:11:06.370 --> 01:11:09.237
Oh, thank you very much.

01:11:09.807 --> 01:11:12.867
-Madam.
-Thank you, Daddy.

01:11:13.043 --> 01:11:16.444
-I love your dress, where's the rest?
-Daddy, it's my creation.

01:11:16.613 --> 01:11:19.138
-I designed it.
-Okay, sell them. Don't wear them.

01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:22.986
Well, no one asked me,
but I think it looks great.

01:11:29.259 --> 01:11:31.420
I want you to meet
my fiancÃ©, Doug Simpson.

01:11:31.595 --> 01:11:34.359
-My mother, Mrs. Pearson.
-Hello, Mrs. Pearson.

01:11:34.531 --> 01:11:36.829
-Call me Emily.
-Oh, how nice.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.991
-Chuck Pearson, my father.
-How are you?

01:11:39.169 --> 01:11:42.104
Nice to meet you, Mr. Pearson.
Or should I call you Chuck?

01:11:42.506 --> 01:11:43.734
No, Mr. Pearson's fine.

01:11:43.907 --> 01:11:46.375
-Come on.
-Friendly.

01:11:55.352 --> 01:11:59.311
Wait a minute. Doug, don't you
find it an odd coincidence...

01:11:59.489 --> 01:12:02.322
...that we're at the same
hotel as Katie's prom?

01:12:02.492 --> 01:12:05.188
-The prom's here? You're kidding.
-Don't give me that.

01:12:05.362 --> 01:12:07.990
You are not going near Katie tonight.

01:12:08.165 --> 01:12:10.258
-I didn't know prom--
-Is something wrong?

01:12:10.434 --> 01:12:12.231
No, no. No, no problem.

01:12:12.402 --> 01:12:15.894
Dad, a friend of mine told me
that the food here is really terrible.

01:12:16.073 --> 01:12:19.008
How tough can it be
to throw on a couple of steaks?

01:12:19.176 --> 01:12:22.441
Come on, your mother and I
are starving. Can we eat, please?

01:12:22.846 --> 01:12:25.007
This way, please.

01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:37.217
Could we have one of those tables?
Isn't this a bit close to the harp?

01:12:37.394 --> 01:12:40.659
Sorry. All the other tables
are reserved.

01:12:41.298 --> 01:12:43.698
I thought you'd say that.

01:12:45.068 --> 01:12:49.198
Well, so are we all comfortable?

01:13:18.302 --> 01:13:21.533
Janet tells me you work
for a radio station.

01:13:21.705 --> 01:13:24.299
Yeah. KHEY Radio.

01:13:24.474 --> 01:13:26.806
It's a rock 'n' roll station, isn't it?

01:13:27.978 --> 01:13:29.206
Yeah, mostly.

01:13:29.379 --> 01:13:31.847
You went to college in the '60s,
didn't you?

01:13:32.382 --> 01:13:34.441
-Yeah.
-Wore your hair long?

01:13:34.618 --> 01:13:37.109
Marched against the war?
Experimented with drugs?

01:13:37.287 --> 01:13:39.619
Played loud rock 'n' roll music?

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:42.987
Wore bell-bottom pants,
burned incense?

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:46.391
-I burnt my share, you know?
-You believed in free love...

01:13:46.563 --> 01:13:48.997
-...live with someone before marriage?
-Dad!

01:13:49.166 --> 01:13:51.691
Then one day you realized
you need a job and ran...

01:13:51.868 --> 01:13:56.066
-...to join the establishment.
-Well, yeah, you're right, but--

01:13:56.239 --> 01:13:59.140
We did a few other things
you seem to have left out.

01:14:00.010 --> 01:14:02.706
-Like what?
-Well, like help stop the war.

01:14:02.879 --> 01:14:07.748
End segregation, launch the Beatles.
The Rolling Stones. The Four Tops.

01:14:07.918 --> 01:14:10.978
The Temps.
And don't forget Sonny and Cher.

01:14:11.254 --> 01:14:14.246
Doug, cut.

01:14:14.424 --> 01:14:17.393
You're saddling Janet
with a built-in family. Is that fair?

01:14:17.561 --> 01:14:19.688
-Dad!
-I assure you, sir...

01:14:19.863 --> 01:14:21.228
...there'll be no problem.

01:14:21.398 --> 01:14:24.925
We get along terrifically.
There's nothing to worry about...

01:14:25.102 --> 01:14:26.865
...is there, Doug?

01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:31.399
-I said, is there, Doug?
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:14:31.575 --> 01:14:35.534
This music is so loud I can hardly
hear what anyone is saying.

01:14:35.712 --> 01:14:38.078
I'm gonna have to speak
to the manager.

01:14:41.952 --> 01:14:45.718
Janet, for the last hour that guy did
nothing but look over my shoulder...

01:14:45.889 --> 01:14:50.155
...at every pretty young girl out in that
lobby. Now, what the hell is going on?

01:15:47.851 --> 01:15:51.412
-I'm afraid you'll have to leave.
-You don't understand. I'm a parent.

01:15:51.588 --> 01:15:55.319
-That makes it twice as sick.
-Well, come on, let's go. Come on.

01:15:56.293 --> 01:16:00.059
Okay, okay, okay. I missed my prom.

01:16:01.631 --> 01:16:03.895
I love Doug, and Doug loves me.

01:16:04.067 --> 01:16:06.194
All right, here he comes,
here he comes.

01:16:06.369 --> 01:16:09.600
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:16:09.773 --> 01:16:12.333
Well, if I may....

01:16:19.116 --> 01:16:24.179
That's it. Janet, it is time to call
a flake a flake and a spade a spade.

01:16:24.354 --> 01:16:26.413
You marry him,
you're out of your mind.

01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:31.755
-I think Doug's just a little nervous.
-Chuck, chill out.

01:16:32.462 --> 01:16:34.953
Excuse me, excuse me.

01:16:39.569 --> 01:16:41.093
Hey, hey. Oh, there you are.

01:16:41.271 --> 01:16:44.536
-I need my car right away.
-I'm sorry. It's crazy around here.

01:16:44.708 --> 01:16:48.200
I understand that. I gave you
money when I got here before.

01:17:02.826 --> 01:17:05.659
-Did you find it?
-I'm trying. I'm trying.

01:17:29.119 --> 01:17:33.021
-Hey! That's my car.
-Hey, man.

01:18:04.254 --> 01:18:06.085
"Restaurant."

01:18:06.256 --> 01:18:08.156
Food.

01:18:23.873 --> 01:18:27.001
Is this romantic or what?

01:18:37.153 --> 01:18:38.518
To us.

01:18:38.688 --> 01:18:40.349
Cheers.

01:18:46.129 --> 01:18:48.654
What time did your father say
he wanted you home?

01:18:48.832 --> 01:18:50.800
Midnight.

01:19:05.815 --> 01:19:08.716
-Who is it?
-Room service.

01:19:11.955 --> 01:19:14.480
Complimentary fruit for
<i>SeÃ±or</i> Timothy Mitchell.

01:19:14.658 --> 01:19:18.424
He's back there somewhere.

01:19:27.704 --> 01:19:29.433
What is the matter?

01:19:29.606 --> 01:19:31.801
I mean, don't you want to?

01:19:34.277 --> 01:19:38.304
-Yes, I want to.
-Okay, so, what's the problem?

01:19:38.481 --> 01:19:40.881
I mean, you're not scared are you?

01:19:41.051 --> 01:19:43.144
No, I'm not scared.

01:19:43.653 --> 01:19:46.213
Then go with your feelings.

01:19:48.024 --> 01:19:51.357
Excuse me, <i>seÃ±or</i>, can you help me
find <i>SeÃ±or</i> Timothy Mitchell?

01:19:51.528 --> 01:19:55.123
Tim-o? The old make-out king.
He's back there somewhere.

01:19:55.298 --> 01:19:56.731
Did I see you at the prom?

01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:02.665
Okay, I get it.

01:20:03.606 --> 01:20:06.404
You want it to be my fault.
I'll do a little grabbing.

01:20:06.576 --> 01:20:11.138
You'll do a little protesting.
Okay, okay, okay, I got it. All right.

01:20:11.314 --> 01:20:13.942
Timothy, stop it.
Look, it's not gonna happen.

01:20:14.117 --> 01:20:16.381
It's not gonna happen?
You want me.

01:20:16.553 --> 01:20:18.145
I mean, you said that you did.

01:20:18.321 --> 01:20:21.916
I did. But not here, not like this.

01:20:23.526 --> 01:20:25.391
It's my first time.

01:20:26.563 --> 01:20:29.031
I'd like it to be special.

01:20:29.733 --> 01:20:31.564
Now take me home.

01:20:34.337 --> 01:20:37.101
You teasing, little bitch.

01:20:40.210 --> 01:20:43.668
Thank you, Timothy.
That was beautiful and special.

01:20:43.847 --> 01:20:45.940
Now, for the second time,
take me home.

01:20:46.116 --> 01:20:48.482
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

01:20:49.352 --> 01:20:51.377
Who you're doing it to?

01:20:51.554 --> 01:20:54.614
-I'll just go. No!
-Okay, okay, okay.

01:20:54.958 --> 01:20:59.486
Easy, no one's gonna touch you.
Let's just sit here and talk for a while...

01:20:59.662 --> 01:21:04.224
...so that way when we both
walk out together, it'll look like I--

01:21:08.037 --> 01:21:10.403
Complimentary fruit for
<i>SeÃ±or</i> Timothy Mitchell.

01:21:10.573 --> 01:21:12.803
We don't want any. Go away.

01:21:15.612 --> 01:21:19.173
-But it's going to spoil, <i>seÃ±or</i>.
-Damn it, Timothy, open the door.

01:21:19.349 --> 01:21:22.807
-Shut up.
-Katie, is that you?

01:21:23.386 --> 01:21:24.876
Who is that?

01:21:38.835 --> 01:21:40.462
Dad?

01:21:41.771 --> 01:21:44.399
What are you doing here?

01:21:46.543 --> 01:21:48.101
You followed me?

01:21:51.848 --> 01:21:54.749
Mr. Simpson, I just want you
to know, nothing happened.

01:21:54.918 --> 01:21:58.786
Sir, nothing happened.
I didn't do anything.

01:21:59.289 --> 01:22:02.690
No, but I did.

01:22:03.193 --> 01:22:04.956
Katie.

01:22:05.228 --> 01:22:08.026
Katie! Katie!

01:22:09.666 --> 01:22:12.794
Well, girls, I'm available.

01:23:50.567 --> 01:23:56.062
...and I do go into that one in my book.
Chapter 27.

01:23:56.906 --> 01:23:59.602
Doug, what are you doing?
We're on the air.

01:23:59.776 --> 01:24:02.074
Some problem that couldn't wait,
Mr. Simpson?

01:24:03.246 --> 01:24:06.682
You don't have a daughter?
You don't even have a daughter?

01:24:06.849 --> 01:24:10.114
No. I don't have a daughter.
So what?

01:24:10.286 --> 01:24:13.847
-I don't even have a family.
-And you never will.

01:24:14.023 --> 01:24:15.991
Get away from that microphone.

01:24:16.159 --> 01:24:18.559
Doug, for the love of God,
we're taking calls.

01:24:18.728 --> 01:24:20.787
Not anymore.
Get away from that mike.

01:24:20.964 --> 01:24:23.660
Mr. Simpson, we will discuss this
in my office.

01:24:23.833 --> 01:24:26.461
-No, we won't.
-Live radio, ladies and gentlemen.

01:24:26.636 --> 01:24:29.469
Is there anything more exciting?
More spontaneous?

01:24:34.811 --> 01:24:39.612
We will be right back
after this brief musical interlude.

01:24:58.534 --> 01:25:00.399
So that's it.

01:25:00.570 --> 01:25:02.834
That's the whole story.

01:25:04.741 --> 01:25:06.470
Can I go now?

01:25:07.410 --> 01:25:10.436
You know, if there was
a Nobel Prize for fathers...

01:25:10.613 --> 01:25:12.581
...this guy should get it.

01:25:13.282 --> 01:25:16.012
I've got five boys.
Thank God.

01:25:16.619 --> 01:25:19.315
-Doug?
-Janet?

01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:25.056
-You're still talking to me?
-Of course. I love you, you big dope.

01:25:25.695 --> 01:25:28.960
Why didn't you tell me you
had a problem with your daughter?

01:25:29.132 --> 01:25:32.329
There isn't a father in the world
wouldn't understand.

01:25:32.502 --> 01:25:34.732
-Proud of you, boy.
-Now, where is she?

01:25:34.904 --> 01:25:37.304
The airport. She was upset
you didn't come home.

01:25:37.473 --> 01:25:41.273
-I didn't tell her what happened.
-No way she's leaving thinking...

01:25:41.444 --> 01:25:44.379
...I'm a jerk who thought I could
get answers from a book.

01:25:44.547 --> 01:25:48.313
But the answers are in a book.
In the top drawer of every motel.

01:25:48.484 --> 01:25:50.281
-You're right, but shut up.
-Amen.

01:25:50.453 --> 01:25:53.945
-We'll get you to the airport.
-Thanks, guys. Thanks. Okay.

01:25:57.493 --> 01:26:01.987
<i>TWA Flight 22,</i>
<i>now boarding for Paris and London.</i>

01:26:12.942 --> 01:26:16.173
Katie, that's us. Europe. Come on.

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.319
Thanks, guys.

01:26:26.756 --> 01:26:28.383
Good luck.

01:26:46.609 --> 01:26:48.702
Excuse me. Can I help you?

01:26:49.612 --> 01:26:51.944
His daughter forgot
her American Express card.

01:26:52.115 --> 01:26:53.412
That's a restricted area!

01:26:53.583 --> 01:26:55.778
I can explain. It's a long story
but sweet.

01:27:00.490 --> 01:27:02.981
Katie! Katie!

01:27:03.593 --> 01:27:06.118
-Katie!
-Dad?

01:27:06.295 --> 01:27:08.195
Katie.

01:27:08.364 --> 01:27:09.854
Katie.

01:27:11.234 --> 01:27:14.169
Sweetheart. Oh, sweetheart.

01:27:15.671 --> 01:27:19.072
-Dad, what happened?
-Just a little pain in the neck.

01:27:19.242 --> 01:27:21.506
Nothing like the pain
I've been to you.

01:27:21.677 --> 01:27:24.737
Dad, I know you did
all those things because you care.

01:27:24.914 --> 01:27:26.541
-It's all right.
-I mean, l--

01:27:26.716 --> 01:27:29.514
I guess I wanted you to stay
a little girl forever.

01:27:29.685 --> 01:27:31.118
I didn't want to lose you.

01:27:31.287 --> 01:27:33.482
Dad, you can never lose me.

01:27:34.524 --> 01:27:37.493
And you were right
about a few things.

01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:41.023
You know, honey,
you really have grown up.

01:27:42.832 --> 01:27:44.800
So have you, Dad.

01:27:46.803 --> 01:27:50.136
Excuse me, miss.
We have to go now.

01:27:50.306 --> 01:27:52.900
-This is a restricted area.
-Okay, just a second.

01:27:53.075 --> 01:27:57.409
-Bye. Bye, baby.
-Bye, Dad. I love you.

01:27:57.580 --> 01:27:59.571
Hi, Katie.

01:28:01.617 --> 01:28:03.517
Hi, Richard.

01:28:05.488 --> 01:28:09.424
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye. Bye.

01:28:18.267 --> 01:28:19.495
So that's the show.

01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:22.103
You introduce Dr. Fishbinder.
He does...

01:28:22.271 --> 01:28:24.739
...20 minutes
of phone interviews, and then...

01:28:24.907 --> 01:28:28.707
...you two square off against
each other. Just like <i>Crossfire</i>.

01:28:28.878 --> 01:28:31.938
Come on, Jeff. You want me
to go on the air with that?

01:28:32.114 --> 01:28:35.140
-It'll never work.
-It already has worked.

01:28:35.318 --> 01:28:38.845
After what happened last week,
we're number six again.

01:28:39.021 --> 01:28:41.990
It's the comeback of the year.
Fishbinder versus Simpson.

01:28:42.158 --> 01:28:46.094
Try to keep an open mind, Doug.
It's a sign of intelligence.

01:28:55.972 --> 01:28:57.667
Hi.

01:28:59.809 --> 01:29:03.939
You probably don't know this,
but Katie left for Europe last week.

01:29:04.113 --> 01:29:07.446
Katie? I'm not here to see Katie.

01:29:07.617 --> 01:29:10.142
I'll be right down, Scooter.

01:29:41.784 --> 01:29:45.652
-Bye, Dad. We're going to a movie.
-Bye, Mr. Simpson.

01:29:45.821 --> 01:29:49.382
A movie, huh?
Well, PG. No R.

01:29:49.558 --> 01:29:51.185
Hey, hey, Bonnie?

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:52.827
I trust you.

01:29:56.899 --> 01:30:00.198
I trust her. I trust her.

01:30:03.472 --> 01:30:05.099
I trust her.

01:30:05.274 --> 01:30:09.836
We'll discuss it Thursday night
on the air.
