<i>Hello, my name is
Eli Pettifog. I'm 13 years old.</i>

00:41.242 --> 00:43.575
<i>Today is my first
day of college.</i>

00:54.321 --> 00:57.189
What you got in that bag, Eli?
Books?

00:57.191 --> 01:00.426
Don't they have a library
at that place?

01:02.296 --> 01:04.462
<i>She's a terrible mother...</i>

01:04.465 --> 01:07.633
<i>but it's not her fault
that I'm a genius.</i>

01:10.571 --> 01:16.241
<i>♪ Can you hear me coming
Feel it all around</i>

01:16.243 --> 01:21.780
<i>♪ Feet are stomping
On the ground</i>

01:21.782 --> 01:25.818
<i>♪ It said something So familiar</i>

01:28.222 --> 01:32.391
Please tell me this is a joke.

01:32.393 --> 01:38.564
I wanted to take you, but
I'm just so tired.

01:42.436 --> 01:46.105
Remember the electric bill is the
most important, then the rent.

01:54.882 --> 02:00.119
Eli... make some friends
out there, okay?

02:10.663 --> 02:12.564
Bye, Mom. Later.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.746
Beacon Falls, Whittman College.

04:11.752 --> 04:15.387
<i>I welcome you to
Whittman College...</i>

04:15.389 --> 04:19.524
<i>the 37th best, small, liberal
arts college on the East Coast.</i>

04:24.632 --> 04:27.733
Lots of stuff to know.

04:27.735 --> 04:31.003
How about some exercise for
the lazy student?

04:31.005 --> 04:38.043
<i>Some people go to college because they
graduate from high school, like me.</i>

04:38.045 --> 04:41.380
<i>Others go and they
self-destruct, like this guy.</i>

04:41.382 --> 04:43.282
Chi Gong.

04:46.353 --> 04:49.821
Badminton or squash?

04:52.626 --> 04:55.060
<i>ELI He had a business once.
He used to sell this stuff.</i>

04:55.062 --> 05:00.732
<i>To these people... and then he
bailed in these things.</i>

05:03.037 --> 05:07.306
Put your shuttlecock away.
It's squash.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.818
Here, let me get that for you.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.654
Give me my bag back. I'm Leo
Searly, late bloomer.

05:22.656 --> 05:26.425
I'm Eli Pettifog, child prodigy,
please can I have my bag back?

05:26.427 --> 05:27.526
You're a freshman?

05:27.528 --> 05:28.493
Unfortunately.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.761
Me, too. What room you in?

05:29.763 --> 05:31.697
212, can I--

05:31.699 --> 05:33.779
Oh, good, it's right here. I'm
right across the hall.

05:35.002 --> 05:40.672
Well, take care,
brush your hair.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.842
<i>I need the oldest undergraduate
in the world as a friend...</i>

05:43.844 --> 05:46.912
<i>like I need a hole in my head.</i>

05:46.914 --> 05:50.649
<i>And I don't need a hole in my head,
if that was what you were wondering.</i>

06:00.627 --> 06:01.827
Hey, want to get a burger?

06:01.829 --> 06:03.061
No.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.996
My treat.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.665
Thanks, but no.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.600
Eli, it's your first
day of college...

06:08.602 --> 06:12.371
you're gonna have plenty of time
to sit alone and hate yourself.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.539
Come on.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.730
Wow, that's good.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.133
That is old-fashioned
American genius.

06:41.135 --> 06:43.402
Have you noticed everything is
genius these days?

06:43.404 --> 06:45.470
How can food be genius?

06:45.472 --> 06:47.639
Try the fries.

06:49.476 --> 06:53.412
That's good, it may be great,
but it's not genius.

06:54.815 --> 06:58.417
Hey, look at that townie girl.

06:58.419 --> 07:01.586
She's checking you out, man.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.422
See you later, Shauna.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.723
See you.

07:07.528 --> 07:10.729
Oh, that was a complete
meltdown of the man nerve.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.631
I'm wearing my hair net.

07:14.435 --> 07:17.769
Safety first. I hear you.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.962
I'm gonna go get us
some more beers.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.031
Nice, I'll just stay here.

07:59.680 --> 08:03.849
I am Leo Searly, late bloomer.

08:03.851 --> 08:06.651
I'm 'Milla, I have
not yet bloomed.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.587
Really? Uh-huh.

08:08.589 --> 08:11.122
You look like you bloomed
to me all right.

08:14.261 --> 08:15.894
Are you Eli Pettifog?

08:15.896 --> 08:17.496
Yeah.

08:17.498 --> 08:21.166
The 13-year-old freshman?

08:21.168 --> 08:26.872
Well, Eli, I want to have your
really, really smart baby.

08:26.874 --> 08:31.776
What makes you think that nine months in your
womb won't make the baby really, really stupid?

08:35.048 --> 08:36.214
Excuse me.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.621
Oh, jeez.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.866
You think your sperm is too
good for my girl or something?

08:54.868 --> 08:56.201
No.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.936
Ow, put me down! Put me down!

08:57.938 --> 09:00.872
Why do you do this shit?
Because I'm a dick!

09:00.874 --> 09:02.574
Say my sperm is not
worthy of Eve Hanson.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.843
Who's Eve Hanson? My girlfriend!

09:04.845 --> 09:07.879
You know, the one you were just hitting on?
She's out of your league, pal.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.948
Yeah, I know she's out of my league.
I don't even like girls.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.316
Somebody's fibbing.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.551
Oh, god.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.221
What's it like down there?

09:16.223 --> 09:18.156
Awesome, I've been there a
thousand times.

09:18.158 --> 09:22.561
Yeah, I'll bet you have.

09:22.563 --> 09:24.596
Say my sperm is not
worthy of Eve Hanson.

09:24.598 --> 09:27.232
Hold on, I can't hear you, my
ears are blocked.

09:28.869 --> 09:32.070
Have some Ebola, asshole!

09:37.177 --> 09:40.679
I'm gonna make this the worst
year of your shitty, little life.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.113
So, we're enemies?

09:42.115 --> 09:47.586
Mortal enemies. Let's
drink to it.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.827
Oh, Jesus, ow, stop.

09:55.829 --> 09:58.663
Remember, I bought
the first round.

10:00.100 --> 10:00.600
Yeah.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.153
Oh, my god.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.372
Oh, god.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.980
I don't feel so good.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.116
Really?

10:54.788 --> 10:56.421
Perfect timing.

11:10.270 --> 11:13.304
Thanks.

11:18.945 --> 11:23.882
Something I want to tell you.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.050
What?

11:25.052 --> 11:26.951
Come closer.

11:34.428 --> 11:36.428
You can come closer.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.069
I'm a genius!

11:46.306 --> 11:49.407
I remember my first beer, too.
Yeah.

11:49.409 --> 11:56.081
Ever since I was a little baby, all I
ever wanted to do was go to Harvard.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.950
My spiritual home.

11:58.952 --> 12:04.189
So, without really trying, I
skipped five grades.

12:04.191 --> 12:10.729
Won all the science fairs,
got my MENSA card.

12:10.731 --> 12:14.099
You know what happened?

12:16.002 --> 12:17.902
Harvard rejected me.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.774
They don't want me.

12:22.776 --> 12:25.276
Well, then, screw them.

12:25.278 --> 12:31.316
You don't understand. It just
killed me, you know?

12:34.054 --> 12:41.025
You want to know the most awful and
humiliating part of the whole, entire story?

12:44.431 --> 12:45.997
You still love the bitch.

12:45.999 --> 12:49.167
Yeah. How'd you know?

12:53.106 --> 12:58.877
All right, if you're gonna puke again,
close one eye, you'll have better aim.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.512
Don't leave.

13:00.514 --> 13:03.314
If the room starts to spin, you
put one foot on the floor.

13:03.316 --> 13:06.918
Yeah. Leo? Leo?

13:06.920 --> 13:08.853
Goodnight. No, Leo, just--

13:08.855 --> 13:11.222
You're all right. Hang in there.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.005
Never mind.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.554
I'm here for my job.

13:42.556 --> 13:45.523
All right, dear, check in
down the hall.

14:11.484 --> 14:14.485
Shit.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.153
Harvard's coming?

14:49.155 --> 14:52.257
Good evening, and welcome to
Collegiate Mastermind.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.661
The varsity sport of the mind.

14:56.663 --> 15:03.468
Tonight's two contestants are
the Whittman Warring Hares...

15:03.470 --> 15:07.205
versus the Harvard
Crimson squad.

15:10.644 --> 15:15.213
First question is a toss-up
worth ten points.

15:15.215 --> 15:21.185
The first question, that should
be the first one on the stack.

15:21.187 --> 15:25.924
Okay, how far can the
Queen Mary 2...

15:25.926 --> 15:29.627
travel on one gallon of...
diesel.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.329
Whittman Warring Hares.

15:31.331 --> 15:34.499
We forfeit.

15:34.501 --> 15:35.700
Incorrect.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.702
No, I mean we forfeit.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.237
You can't forfeit.

15:39.239 --> 15:43.441
We haven't won a
match since 1971.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.313
Oh. Harvard to steal.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.715
Six inches.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.585
Six inches is correct.

15:54.587 --> 15:57.555
Yes!

16:01.628 --> 16:05.663
Caution, Harvard at this
time for showboating.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.003
Man, if I were on the
Whittman team...

16:12.005 --> 16:17.275
my dad would send me into the woods to find the
perfect piece of birch to split my ass with.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.677
Hey, there's the little dude.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.716
Thanks for the support, little
dude. What's your name?

16:24.718 --> 16:25.984
Eli.

16:25.986 --> 16:28.019
You the man, Eli.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.489
How old are you?

16:31.491 --> 16:32.757
13.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.760
Uh-oh, he's a genius.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.563
Yeah.

16:38.565 --> 16:41.099
Yeah, you are.

16:41.101 --> 16:47.438
13, walking around Harvard with
hair like that? That's bad ass.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.475
You want a ride back to campus?

16:50.477 --> 16:51.609
To Boston?

16:51.611 --> 16:53.611
Yeah, let's roll.

16:58.418 --> 17:04.722
Yo, Eli, get in... or we
aren't gonna haze you.

17:04.723 --> 17:06.023
I can't.

17:06.026 --> 17:09.527
Why not?

17:09.529 --> 17:12.363
Because I don't go to Harvard.

17:12.365 --> 17:17.702
I'm a freshman here at Whittman...
but my soul belongs to Harvard.

17:17.704 --> 17:25.704
Don't worry about it, the important
thing is we part company like men.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.679
Listen to me, you little freak.
Ow, oh, my god.

17:28.681 --> 17:33.618
Harvard doesn't want your soul. Your
soul is cheap, and it's mediocre.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.486
Ow, stop. It's a Whittman soul.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.503
But they went on to win that year.
How does that help us right now?

18:25.505 --> 18:27.605
I'm just saying you should
learn, you know, perseverance.

18:27.607 --> 18:31.242
Alan, if you didn't know the
answer, why did you buzz?

18:31.244 --> 18:33.111
Because--

18:33.113 --> 18:35.246
You can't do that. If you
don't know, don't buzz.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.447
Hey.

18:38.118 --> 18:41.385
My name is Eli Pettifog.

18:43.323 --> 18:50.695
This is Leo Searly's last
chance at a classy future.

18:50.697 --> 18:58.269
He's not afraid to gamble it
all on a hole and a ball.

18:58.271 --> 19:02.240
Hits the putt.

19:02.242 --> 19:06.410
Oh, it's on the lip. No, no, no,
it's rolling in. It's rolling in.

19:06.412 --> 19:07.879
Oh, yes!

19:07.881 --> 19:13.251
Leo Searly takes home
$100 million-- Hey.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.452
Hey, how are you?

19:14.454 --> 19:15.753
Can I tell you something
super important?

19:15.755 --> 19:17.688
Okay. As long as it's not
teenage stuff.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.390
Don't worry. This is as
grown up as it gets.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.626
All right.

19:21.628 --> 19:25.196
First, I now hate Harvard with the
fanatical rage of a freedom fighter.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.698
That sounds pretty
teenage to me.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.301
And I've sworn my life to
its destruction.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.303
The entire university?

19:32.305 --> 19:35.506
No, just the college,
I'm only one man.

19:35.508 --> 19:40.678
Second, I'm now the new captain of the Whittman
Warring Hares Collegiate Mastermind Team.

19:40.680 --> 19:45.550
Oh, I loved that game as a kid.
That's the one with the pegs.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.885
Like the little colored pegs,
then you get a combination--

19:47.887 --> 19:51.322
No, it's a quiz show in which
two colleges compete...

19:51.324 --> 19:54.525
to see which one is smart and
which one is dumb.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.295
It's like the show Jeopardy,
with no money.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.297
No money?

19:59.299 --> 20:03.334
Forget the money, Leo. I found
the instrument of my revenge.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.782
What makes him think he can
walk in here and say...

20:17.784 --> 20:19.617
"I'm Eli Pettifog and I'm
your new captain?"

20:19.619 --> 20:23.754
Because none of us walked in
and said I'm your new captain.

20:23.756 --> 20:27.592
The first four digits
of pi are 3.141.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.727
What is the billionth
digit of pi?

20:31.364 --> 20:32.496
Nine.

20:32.498 --> 20:33.664
Right you are.

20:33.666 --> 20:34.699
Dude.

20:38.271 --> 20:39.937
Here's your bonus.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.973
Assuming Rudolph was in front...

20:41.975 --> 20:45.876
how many ways are there to arrange
the other eight reindeer?

20:45.878 --> 20:48.746
40,320.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.848
Right you are. You're fast, kid.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.684
Dude! Captain.

20:53.686 --> 20:57.955
Shit, dude, viral
pandemic sick! Or not.

21:19.012 --> 21:21.579
Ssh, I'm trying to study.

21:38.064 --> 21:40.398
You should have a package
for Eli Pettifog.

21:40.400 --> 21:45.870
Pettifog, okay. P-E-T-T-I-F-O-G?

21:45.872 --> 21:46.971
Yeah.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.641
Weird name. What's it mean?

21:50.643 --> 21:55.846
Okay, here we go. Pettifog means
you bicker over everything.

21:55.848 --> 21:58.416
That's ridiculous.

21:58.418 --> 22:04.055
Second definition, to practice
deception or trickery.

22:04.057 --> 22:06.791
Do you have a package
for me or not?

22:06.793 --> 22:11.862
There's no package for you, Pettifog.
No lying or complaining.

22:11.864 --> 22:12.897
Okay.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.901
Hey. Can I use your phone?

22:16.903 --> 22:19.370
Yeah, sure.

22:28.514 --> 22:29.747
It's private.

22:29.749 --> 22:31.882
I understand.

22:36.356 --> 22:42.059
<i>SHEILA Hey, if you want to party,
leave a message. All right, whatever.</i>

22:42.061 --> 22:47.798
Hey, Mom, I'm calling to remind
you you forgot my birthday again.

22:50.370 --> 22:51.469
It's your birthday?

22:51.471 --> 22:53.771
Yeah. Big 1-4.

22:53.773 --> 22:54.317
Hang on.

23:03.683 --> 23:05.049
Faster.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.818
Okay.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.053
Whoo!

23:09.055 --> 23:10.521
Faster.

23:11.391 --> 23:12.890
Faster?

23:12.892 --> 23:16.060
Yeah!

23:17.096 --> 23:18.929
Whoo!

23:18.931 --> 23:20.931
Faster.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.466
Whoo!

23:28.608 --> 23:30.975
Thanks, Leo, that
was really fun.

23:30.977 --> 23:34.111
Well, happy birthday, Eli.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.048
Leo! SEARLY: Yo!

23:38.050 --> 23:40.851
Faster!

24:01.974 --> 24:03.607
What's wrong with this thing?

24:03.609 --> 24:07.912
Hey, fuzzy, that's my
favorite machine.

24:07.914 --> 24:10.080
Hi.

24:10.082 --> 24:11.449
Happy birthday.

24:11.451 --> 24:12.817
Thanks.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.618
I wish I could go to Whittman.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.555
There's no Mall Studies
major at Whittman.

24:17.557 --> 24:22.993
I'm not a mall girl. I only shop
at the most exclusive boutiques.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.128
Mm-hm.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.532
You want to shotgun?

24:28.534 --> 24:30.801
What's a shotgun?

24:30.803 --> 24:35.639
Let me show you. Okay.

24:43.015 --> 24:46.684
I know you have a thing for me.

24:46.686 --> 24:50.488
What are you gonna do about it?

24:50.490 --> 24:51.989
What are you talking about?

24:51.991 --> 24:56.660
I see you checking out my
boyish curves.

24:56.662 --> 24:59.864
Come, lay down with me.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.508
You want to know a secret?

25:10.510 --> 25:12.276
Okay.

25:12.278 --> 25:15.012
I never kissed anyone.

25:16.816 --> 25:20.184
So what? Neither have I.

25:20.186 --> 25:25.055
I'm worried I might suck at it.

25:25.057 --> 25:28.859
How hard can it be?

25:28.861 --> 25:31.729
Kissing is too
important to be easy.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.239
Not my lip.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.108
Well, stop squirming.

25:44.110 --> 25:48.546
Are you supposed to be drooling
directly into my mouth?

25:56.889 --> 26:01.191
Toss up. Which states, in order
of entry into the union...

26:01.193 --> 26:07.331
is Bruce "The Boss"
Springsteen not from?

26:07.333 --> 26:09.066
Whittman?

26:09.068 --> 26:13.671
Delaware, Pennsylvania,
Georgia, Connecticut...

26:13.673 --> 26:19.243
Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina,
New Hampshire, Virginia, New York...

26:19.245 --> 26:21.679
North Carolina, Rhode Island,
Vermont, Kentucky, uh...

26:24.050 --> 26:25.983
Keep going.

26:25.985 --> 26:32.056
Not Tennessee, Ohio, Louisiana,
Indiana, Mississippi, Illinois...

26:32.058 --> 26:39.029
Alabama, Maine, Missouri, Arkansas,
Michigan, Florida, Texas, Iowa...

26:39.031 --> 26:42.333
Wisconsin, California,
Minnesota...

26:42.335 --> 26:44.301
15 seconds.

26:44.303 --> 26:48.772
Um, not Oregon, Kansas, West
Virginia, Nevada...

26:48.774 --> 26:51.275
Nebraska, Colorado, North
Dakota, South Dakota.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.910
Do it, weirdo!

26:52.912 --> 26:55.112
Yeah, do it.

26:55.114 --> 27:02.052
Montana, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah,
New Mexico, Arizona, Alaska, nor Hawaii.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.723
By god, he's done it.

27:08.327 --> 27:13.030
Nice. Very nice.

27:13.032 --> 27:18.669
In-frigging-conceivable.
Frigging magnificent.

27:18.671 --> 27:22.006
Frigging, frigging. I want a
piece of your action.

27:22.008 --> 27:23.307
You can't have any of my action.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.376
Do you even know what
your action is?

27:25.378 --> 27:27.778
You're the one who started
talking about my action.

27:27.780 --> 27:33.951
Your action is blowing people away with
your genius, and your bizarre charisma.

27:33.953 --> 27:38.188
You're a college star
in the making.

27:38.190 --> 27:42.292
My quest is private, Leo, it's
not for other people.

27:44.030 --> 27:47.031
Do you think I should
start a blog?

28:39.452 --> 28:41.085
Whoa.

28:44.457 --> 28:45.756
Nice try, Leo.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.057
Mm?

28:47.059 --> 28:49.426
This jacket is from
sweatshop city.

28:49.428 --> 28:53.230
What are you talking about? It was
stitched in Beacon Falls, USA.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.232
Makes me look like I have
old-man shoulders.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.901
Man shoulders are a perk.

28:57.903 --> 29:02.806
Oh. Then how come the
waist is so tight?

29:02.808 --> 29:10.180
What are you talking about? It's
form-fitting. Flatters the silhouette.

29:10.182 --> 29:14.284
Oh. Well, what about the collar?

29:14.286 --> 29:17.254
The jacket's perfect, Eli.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.089
You promise?

29:19.091 --> 29:20.357
Yeah.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.428
Must be why I love it so much.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.821
Excuse me, hello, thank you very much.
I hope you all enjoy your lunch.

29:50.823 --> 29:54.825
Today we're offering
$1,000 to anyone...

29:54.827 --> 29:59.930
who can stump the Whittman Warring
Hares Collegiate Mastermind squad.

29:59.932 --> 30:01.431
Perky girl.

30:01.433 --> 30:04.868
Okay, why does he have pubic
hair on his head?

30:04.870 --> 30:08.238
Not the sort of question we're
looking for. Next!

30:08.240 --> 30:10.274
But the people want to know.
Don't you want to know?

30:10.276 --> 30:12.810
Yeah.

30:12.812 --> 30:17.047
Okay, the people want to know, why does
your hair look like "down there" hair?

30:17.049 --> 30:19.283
That's a great question.

30:19.285 --> 30:22.986
My hair resembles pubic hair, because
it is designed to protect my brain.

30:22.988 --> 30:25.322
Protect your brain from what?

30:25.324 --> 30:27.124
From stupidity.

30:29.461 --> 30:31.094
You calling me stupid?

30:31.096 --> 30:34.164
Mm, mm-mm. They're
calling you stupid.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.465
What about you?

30:35.467 --> 30:37.434
I'm calling you stupid, too.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.236
Ouch.

30:39.238 --> 30:44.341
Yeah? Who will be stupid when I'm
eating your brain, Pettifog?

30:44.343 --> 30:47.544
Grilled... with sea salt.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.081
You're gonna grill my brain?

30:51.083 --> 30:52.516
He's gonna grill your brain.

30:58.057 --> 31:02.159
Cave man, you can't
even start a fire.

31:03.863 --> 31:05.095
I'll rub your bones together.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.396
Name one bone.

31:06.398 --> 31:07.598
Your skull bone!

31:07.600 --> 31:10.067
All right, kids, come on,
calm down.

31:10.069 --> 31:13.103
Thank you very much. Don't forget
to come and see the Warring Hares.

31:13.105 --> 31:15.305
I could take him. Put me down.
Bus your tables.

31:20.479 --> 31:23.380
I want to thank you for benching me. I
never felt so confident in my life.

31:23.382 --> 31:28.352
Hey, what are friends for?

31:28.354 --> 31:30.220
Hey, sexy genius.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.055
Hey, sexy lady, what's up?

31:32.057 --> 31:34.458
She's not talking to you. What
are you talking about?

31:34.460 --> 31:38.662
Hey, you teach me,
I'll teach you.

31:38.664 --> 31:42.132
A little quid pro blow, as they
say in modern Latin.

31:46.338 --> 31:50.040
See you at Vassar. Bye, boys.

31:50.042 --> 31:51.642
It's quid pro quo.

31:51.644 --> 31:54.478
In Collegiate Mastermind, it
might be quid pro quo...

31:54.480 --> 31:58.415
but in the game of life, her
interpretation is right on the sticky bun.

31:58.417 --> 32:01.151
You're so cool, I think I'm
gonna call you the fog.

32:01.153 --> 32:03.353
Please, don't call me the fog.
That makes me sound dense.

32:03.355 --> 32:04.922
Sorry.

32:04.924 --> 32:06.356
Hey, baby.

32:06.358 --> 32:07.557
Hi, Gertrude.

32:07.559 --> 32:09.639
Hi, ladies. Where's Leo? Hey,
Gertrude.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.963
Ha-ha, looks like we got a ride.

32:12.965 --> 32:16.233
Nice. Yes, the van.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.502
So sweet. Oh, my god,
this is awesome.

32:18.504 --> 32:20.604
Neat, so cool. Fluffy and soft.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.372
Do you have a bed in this
thing? I like this car.

32:22.374 --> 32:25.676
Nice, isn't it? Feels kind of
like a land couch.

32:25.678 --> 32:28.078
Hey, Leo, guess what? Eli
has a groupie.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.546
Shut up, Romeo. Jesus.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.348
What's her name? Eve Hanson,
she's a senior.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.150
She cute?

32:33.152 --> 32:35.953
She looks like Gertrude, if you
gave her blonde hair and money.

32:35.955 --> 32:42.693
Romeo, the only groupie you're
ever gonna have is your hand.

32:42.695 --> 32:43.727
That really hurt.

32:43.729 --> 32:44.728
Good.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.096
Buckle up, kids!

32:57.476 --> 33:00.344
Rhinotillexomania is
compulsive nose picking.

33:00.346 --> 33:02.479
Gynecomastia means man boobs.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.514
The naked mole rat is
immune to cancer.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.316
Whittman College has
won the match.

33:09.722 --> 33:14.191
And for the match, what syndrome does
pop star Lily Allen have? Whittman.

33:14.193 --> 33:18.095
The super numerary nipple
syndrome, the triple nipple.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.096
Correct!

33:21.633 --> 33:24.568
Abalone is not a mollusk, but a
large marine snail.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.410
That's correct. Match goes to
Whittman College.

33:29.008 --> 33:32.376
The aquatic scrotum resides
primarily in Lake Titicaca.

33:32.378 --> 33:33.643
Whittman wins!

33:33.645 --> 33:35.045
Yes!

33:37.483 --> 33:39.483
Out of beer!

33:40.753 --> 33:43.420
Warriors!

33:56.301 --> 33:58.368
Safety first, safety first.

34:48.620 --> 34:49.753
Oh, my god!

34:49.755 --> 34:51.188
Hi.

34:51.190 --> 34:52.621
Can you please stay
away from me?

34:54.493 --> 34:57.561
Don't worry, Laird never
comes to the library.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.429
I find you fascinating.

34:59.431 --> 35:01.231
No, you don't.

35:01.233 --> 35:03.567
And dangerous.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.671
I'm very safe.

35:09.341 --> 35:10.674
Do I scare you?

35:10.676 --> 35:13.577
Yes, very much.

35:13.579 --> 35:20.650
Well, just try to look past my breasts and
everything else, and see the real me.

35:20.652 --> 35:25.288
Look past your breasts? I can't
even look at them.

35:25.290 --> 35:29.826
Just-- right-- do you need...

35:29.828 --> 35:30.908
I'm not gonna look at them.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.334
Don't worry,
Romeo, we can beat Yale.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.869
It's not that.

35:38.871 --> 35:40.504
Well, what is it?

35:40.506 --> 35:42.639
My brother goes to Yale.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.374
Oh, really, that's a bummer.

35:44.376 --> 35:47.344
It's only because he is an
author and a Puerto Rican.

35:47.346 --> 35:51.414
I did not get into Yale, because my mighty
mas macho terrifies the white man...

35:51.416 --> 35:53.550
until his balls are
like raisins.

35:53.552 --> 35:56.786
But it still hurts, you know?

35:56.788 --> 35:58.889
Every night it still hurts.

35:58.891 --> 36:04.427
So you have a smarter brother?
Is he better looking, too?

36:04.429 --> 36:07.464
Yeah, but only a little bit.

36:09.935 --> 36:17.935
Eli, can you dedicate this one to Romeo?
He's really hurting back here.

36:17.943 --> 36:21.444
Sure. This one's for you,
big guy.

36:29.354 --> 36:33.256
Good evening, and welcome to
the Yale Bulldogs...

36:33.258 --> 36:38.929
versus the Whittman
Warring Hares.

36:38.931 --> 36:41.965
First question is a toss up
for ten points.

36:41.967 --> 36:45.902
How many names are listed on
the Vietnam War Memorial?

36:45.904 --> 36:48.238
58,652.

36:48.240 --> 36:50.840
Wrong, Whittman for the steal?

36:50.842 --> 36:53.476
58,256.

36:53.478 --> 36:57.414
That is oh, so right.
Bonus to Whittman.

36:57.416 --> 37:01.985
The memorial is built from black granite.
Where does this granite come from?

37:01.987 --> 37:03.520
Bangalore, India.

37:03.522 --> 37:06.823
Right again. Toss up.

37:06.825 --> 37:10.694
Who invented the roulette
wheel and why?

37:10.696 --> 37:12.996
French philosopher...

37:12.998 --> 37:16.566
mathematician Blaise Pascal invented
roulette for perpetual motion experiments.

37:16.568 --> 37:20.337
That is oh, so right.
Bonus to Yale.

37:20.339 --> 37:24.808
Why is roulette called
the Devil's Game?

37:24.810 --> 37:27.644
Because all the numbers on the
wheel add up to 666.

37:27.646 --> 37:28.678
Correct.

37:30.549 --> 37:31.982
Huddle up. What?

37:31.984 --> 37:33.883
I'm not kidding. What's up?

37:33.885 --> 37:36.386
Some girls know about roulette,
other girls know about the devil...

37:36.388 --> 37:37.754
but no girl knows about both.

37:37.756 --> 37:40.624
Especially not girls like that.
She's cheating.

37:40.626 --> 37:42.626
How do you know?

37:42.628 --> 37:45.262
Check out the receiver, it's
hidden, it's right there.

37:45.264 --> 37:47.464
Yeah, I see it. Somebody's
feeding her the answers.

37:47.466 --> 37:49.733
I bet she cheated to get
into Yale, too.

37:49.735 --> 37:52.535
I bet she took your spot.

37:52.537 --> 37:55.338
Whittman, break your huddle.

37:55.340 --> 37:59.609
All right, guys, here's your choice. We can
beat them fair and square. I promise we can.

37:59.611 --> 38:05.815
Or, we could put an eternal stain on their
lives. It's your call. Yale's your white whale.

38:05.817 --> 38:07.717
Eternal stain.

38:07.719 --> 38:08.952
All right, just be cool.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.020
I can't be cool.

38:10.022 --> 38:12.422
Oh, god.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.059
My earring.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.732
Whoo!

38:22.734 --> 38:24.467
Daniel, my brother, Turran.

38:26.872 --> 38:33.910
My country tis of thee,
sweet land of liberty.

38:46.692 --> 38:49.759
I know you saw that sign.

38:49.761 --> 38:52.762
Yeah, I saw it.

39:41.847 --> 39:46.716
Here we are at Harvard...
smartest place on Earth.

39:50.689 --> 39:53.056
This is the freshman dorm
madam's house.

39:53.058 --> 39:56.059
Some of the rooms
have fireplaces.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.094
Get over it.

40:02.534 --> 40:04.033
What are you doing?

40:04.035 --> 40:07.837
What does it look
like I'm doing?

40:43.442 --> 40:47.010
What's the high score
in this machine?

40:47.012 --> 40:51.781
I'm wearing
watermelon lip gloss.

40:57.989 --> 40:59.722
The flavor is disappearing, can
you put on some more?

40:59.724 --> 41:01.224
I have cherry, too.

41:01.226 --> 41:04.627
No, this is the one. This is
definitely the one.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.872
You're a really good kisser,
Eli.

41:15.874 --> 41:18.007
Thanks.

41:18.009 --> 41:23.213
We can't do this all day...
unless it leads somewhere else.

41:23.215 --> 41:24.914
Like where?

41:24.916 --> 41:27.617
Like my neck.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.118
What about your neck?

41:29.120 --> 41:31.054
Kiss it.

41:31.056 --> 41:33.022
Okay.

41:41.967 --> 41:44.033
That feels so good.

41:45.871 --> 41:48.104
Now the other side.

41:48.106 --> 41:49.672
You mean-- okay.

42:03.154 --> 42:04.954
Eli.

42:04.956 --> 42:06.890
Yeah?

42:06.892 --> 42:08.258
Do you have a roommate?

42:08.260 --> 42:10.793
No.

42:10.795 --> 42:12.795
You should invite me over.

42:12.797 --> 42:19.168
You know, me being on campus might
make me into a crazy woman.

42:25.310 --> 42:30.280
Did you know that every time you recall a memory,
you're making the whole thing up from scratch?

42:30.282 --> 42:33.683
That's ridiculous, my memories
are exactly the same every time.

42:33.685 --> 42:38.655
Oh, okay. What was I
wearing when we met?

42:38.657 --> 42:40.089
Nothing.

42:40.091 --> 42:42.091
Come on, I'm trying to
do science here.

42:42.093 --> 42:45.795
Don't you need test hares or
something like that?

42:45.797 --> 42:49.899
What color lipstick did your
wife wear at your wedding? Hm?

42:49.901 --> 42:51.834
How did you know that
I was married?

42:51.836 --> 42:56.105
It's written all over you.
Divorced guy goes to college.

42:56.107 --> 42:58.908
Not a good look, is it?

42:58.910 --> 43:00.977
It's not a look, it's a life.

43:00.979 --> 43:03.112
Hey, you want to go
back to my room?

43:03.114 --> 43:06.683
Sure, I still have 20 more pages
before we have a sex break.

43:06.685 --> 43:11.321
Okay, fine, no highlighting, no looking
stuff up, no dog-earing pages.

43:11.323 --> 43:12.655
Deal.

43:12.657 --> 43:13.723
Deal.

43:15.226 --> 43:17.093
Divorce is sexy. Really?

43:17.095 --> 43:19.829
Yeah, as long as you don't have
any brats running around you.

43:19.831 --> 43:22.065
Uh-huh.

43:22.067 --> 43:27.236
Yo, Laird wants a truce, he's all
fruity for you or something.

43:27.238 --> 43:32.008
A truce, huh? Okay, take this,
you need it.

43:33.078 --> 43:34.177
Laird.

43:34.179 --> 43:38.281
Pettifog.

43:41.720 --> 43:43.119
Tell me we're going to
beat Princeton.

43:43.121 --> 43:44.754
We're gonna beat Princeton.

43:44.756 --> 43:46.155
Tell me we're going to
the Final Four.

43:46.157 --> 43:48.057
Final Four? We're
going all the way.

43:48.059 --> 43:50.927
Did you just promise me a
national championship?

43:50.929 --> 43:53.663
I'm guaranteeing it.

43:53.665 --> 43:56.032
I believe you, Eli.

43:56.034 --> 43:59.969
I believe that you can restore glory to
Whittman athletics and make us whole again.

43:59.971 --> 44:01.738
Yeah, I promise I will.

44:01.740 --> 44:07.176
But if you fail, I will make
you retarded with my fist.

44:07.178 --> 44:09.078
Okay.

44:28.933 --> 44:32.802
I'm gonna make this the worst
year of your shitty, little life.

44:32.804 --> 44:37.907
But if you fail, I will make
you retarded with my fist.

44:40.145 --> 44:46.049
We're not dumb! We're not dumb!
We're not dumb!

44:46.051 --> 44:47.450
We're not dumb! We're not dumb!

44:47.452 --> 44:50.887
Hey, I'm Eli Pettifog,
ask me anything.

44:54.426 --> 44:57.060
Yo, this is total commitment.

44:57.062 --> 44:58.428
What are you talking about?

44:58.430 --> 45:01.197
Pettifog, he means it.

45:01.199 --> 45:03.032
Let me see that.

45:07.172 --> 45:11.074
Oh, please, that's Kiss,
we're the Beatles.

45:12.844 --> 45:13.344
Tigers!

45:17.082 --> 45:20.383
We're not dumb! We're not dumb!
We're not dumb!

45:20.385 --> 45:22.885
Win this one, we make it to
the Final Four.

45:22.887 --> 45:26.255
My father will kill me. '69
team lost to Princeton.

45:26.257 --> 45:28.091
You afraid of your father?

45:28.093 --> 45:29.358
Everybody is
afraid of their father.

45:29.360 --> 45:30.727
I can't believe how
nervous I am.

45:30.729 --> 45:32.795
You've got no reason
to be nervous.

45:32.797 --> 45:35.364
No, I know, I was just trying
to make you feel useful.

45:35.366 --> 45:40.870
Just get up there and give it
all the brains you got.

45:40.872 --> 45:45.808
We're not dumb! We're not dumb!
We're not dumb! We're not dumb!

45:50.014 --> 45:54.917
Good evening and welcome to
Collegiate Mastermind.

46:02.527 --> 46:08.898
All right, the first question
is a toss-up worth ten points.

46:08.900 --> 46:14.036
Which president created a company slogan
by describing a certain brand of coffee...

46:14.038 --> 46:16.472
as being "good to
the last drop"?

46:16.474 --> 46:18.474
Teddy Roosevelt.

46:18.476 --> 46:20.243
Correct.

46:23.915 --> 46:29.819
Here's your bonus. In Italy, what
is the average age of a barista?

46:29.821 --> 46:30.953
48.

46:30.955 --> 46:32.388
MODERATOR Nicely done.

46:36.227 --> 46:42.331
Toss-up now. What is the longest word ever
used by a presidential press secretary?

46:42.333 --> 46:45.001
Floxinoxinihilipilification.

46:45.003 --> 46:48.437
That's the word.
Here's your bonus.

46:48.439 --> 46:55.244
What is the longest word in the English language
whose letters can be played on the piano?

46:59.450 --> 47:00.516
Cabbaged.

47:00.518 --> 47:04.287
Musical. Toss-up.

47:04.289 --> 47:10.526
How much money did Abraham Lincoln have in
his pocket at the time of his assassination?

47:10.528 --> 47:12.195
Five dollars in
Confederate money.

47:12.197 --> 47:16.132
Nice shot, Whittman, all the
way to the bank.

47:21.139 --> 47:25.474
I want to have your baby!

47:25.476 --> 47:31.581
Here's your bonus. What is the average
life span of a U.S. dollar in circulation?

47:31.583 --> 47:32.582
18 months.

47:32.584 --> 47:35.151
MODERATOR Correct.

47:39.123 --> 47:40.523
Such an intense sport.

47:40.525 --> 47:41.924
It's all in the coaching.

47:41.926 --> 47:44.527
Toss-up. Who wrote Fart Proudly?

47:44.529 --> 47:46.095
Benjamin Franklin.

47:46.097 --> 47:48.231
Exactly. Nostalgie De La Boue.

47:48.233 --> 47:50.132
Bingo. 28,420.

47:50.134 --> 47:51.868
Well done!

47:51.870 --> 47:58.274
Bella Abzug. The Stockholm
Syndrome. The number one.

47:58.276 --> 48:01.477
Banging your head against a wall
burns 150 calories per hour.

48:01.479 --> 48:06.115
On average, right-handed people live nine
years longer than left-handed people.

48:06.117 --> 48:07.350
Mike Huckabee.

48:07.352 --> 48:10.486
The mainland tiger snake.

48:10.488 --> 48:15.558
The two presidents who's names contain
the letters that form criminal...

48:15.560 --> 48:19.161
are Richard Millhouse Nixon and
William Jefferson Clinton.

48:19.163 --> 48:24.166
If Barbie were life-size, she
would stand 7 feet, 2 inches.

48:29.407 --> 48:35.912
Whoo! It is a tight race, if I
do say so myself.

48:35.914 --> 48:43.052
This final question will determine
which team will go to the Final Four.

48:43.054 --> 48:44.954
Teams at your buzzers.

48:56.334 --> 48:59.001
Who first said, "Elvis has
left the building"?

49:01.306 --> 49:02.371
Whittman!

49:02.373 --> 49:03.639
Horace Lee Logan!

49:03.641 --> 49:07.443
Holy shit, that's right.

49:07.445 --> 49:11.147
Princeton
loses! Princeton loses!

49:11.149 --> 49:14.216
And Whittman College advances
to the Final Four!

49:14.218 --> 49:17.320
We're not dumb! We're not dumb!

49:26.664 --> 49:31.200
Whoa, whoa, whoa, kid, now
that's over the line.

49:34.305 --> 49:36.205
I can't believe it.

50:00.064 --> 50:02.465
Yo.

50:02.467 --> 50:03.632
Yo.

50:17.615 --> 50:20.016
Hey, Pettifog.

50:20.018 --> 50:23.285
I have registered mail.

50:23.287 --> 50:30.192
You know what, Pettifog? You're no Pettifog.
You're an angel of knowledge with a kinky halo.

50:30.194 --> 50:33.295
Saw you the other night,
awesome.

50:33.297 --> 50:35.765
Thanks.

50:35.767 --> 50:40.369
Hey, Pettifog? Hi-ya!

50:47.111 --> 50:51.580
What? Oh, shit, no!

50:51.582 --> 50:54.717
To the academic building, and the
first thing we're gonna do is--

50:54.719 --> 50:58.687
Uh, question, what is the student
bathroom ratio on this campus?

50:58.689 --> 51:00.189
Sophie?

51:00.191 --> 51:03.125
Yes. Who are you?

51:03.127 --> 51:07.296
Um... I'm Leo Searly.

51:09.700 --> 51:12.301
My bio dad?

51:12.303 --> 51:14.570
Your father.

51:14.572 --> 51:19.842
No. That's my father.

51:19.844 --> 51:21.710
Don't tell me you're a
professor here.

51:21.712 --> 51:26.082
No, uh, yes? I'm not
tenured yet, well--

51:26.084 --> 51:32.655
You left when I was seven, and now you're
teaching at my top college choice?

51:32.657 --> 51:36.492
You're ruining my life
all over again.

51:36.494 --> 51:39.328
And you don't even care that
you're ruining my life.

51:39.330 --> 51:43.132
All you care about
is Leo Searly.

51:43.134 --> 51:50.573
Three-time loser and
pathetic Peter Pan.

51:50.575 --> 51:53.409
Soph-- Sophie, just give me
another chance.

51:58.282 --> 52:01.117
She ain't here, Fuzzy.

52:07.558 --> 52:11.527
Read it. Read the letter!

52:17.602 --> 52:21.570
Collegiate Mastermind...
Dear Eli Pettifog...

52:21.572 --> 52:24.673
The Collegiate Mastermind
Committee hereby suspends you...

52:24.675 --> 52:29.411
from the semi-final match of this year's
Final Four for actions unbecoming?

52:29.413 --> 52:32.381
La-la-la... section four,
code 93...

52:32.383 --> 52:35.384
You're not even allowed in the
building. Is this for real?

52:35.386 --> 52:38.854
Yes, it's for real, this is
your fault, Leo.

52:38.856 --> 52:41.423
You got me the team jackets.
You got me the van.

52:41.425 --> 52:45.194
You made me popular. How could
you do those things?

52:45.196 --> 52:47.630
I knew I shouldn't have
enrolled you in karate classes.

52:47.632 --> 52:52.835
That's typical Leo Searly sarcasm. You
just don't care about anyone or anything.

52:55.173 --> 52:57.706
Jesus Christ, I can't believe
this is happening.

52:57.708 --> 53:00.910
I had Harvard dangling over
the falls, Leo.

53:00.912 --> 53:03.512
You have to do
something about this.

53:03.514 --> 53:05.748
You have to go to the Collegiate Mastermind
headquarters and you have to set them straight.

53:05.750 --> 53:07.316
I can't do that.

53:07.318 --> 53:08.517
Why not?

53:08.519 --> 53:10.853
You just burst in
their offices...

53:10.855 --> 53:13.822
you tell them you're my father and they're
messing with my destiny or something.

53:13.824 --> 53:17.960
You know that there are some
things that you just can't change.

53:24.835 --> 53:27.836
I thought you were afraid
to talk to me?

53:27.838 --> 53:31.874
I've been suspended from the
semi-final match.

53:31.876 --> 53:33.275
For karate? You idiot.

53:38.316 --> 53:41.584
I know, but they never
even warned me.

53:41.586 --> 53:44.420
I hope you consider coming to Whittman,
you're a wonderful candidate.

53:44.422 --> 53:45.654
Thank you so much.

53:45.656 --> 53:48.224
Okay, see you. Bye-bye. Bye.

53:48.226 --> 53:51.560
Do you ever consider the possibility
that maybe you're the patsy in all this?

53:51.562 --> 53:53.796
I was set up? Why
would I be set up?

53:53.798 --> 53:56.799
Look, they used you to bring
attention to the Mastermind.

53:56.801 --> 53:59.969
But at the end of the day, they
were never gonna let you win.

53:59.971 --> 54:01.704
You're collegiate white trash.

54:01.706 --> 54:03.806
You're even more
paranoid than I am.

54:03.808 --> 54:06.508
Things like this happen
all the time.

54:08.312 --> 54:10.879
Hi.

54:10.881 --> 54:12.748
Hi.

54:12.750 --> 54:14.683
Hello.

54:14.685 --> 54:16.652
Hello.

54:16.654 --> 54:20.623
I've been looking all over for
you. What are you doing here?

54:20.625 --> 54:24.727
Um, I just finished my interview
and then the campus store.

54:24.729 --> 54:27.529
Now I'm in the library,
which is awesome.

54:27.531 --> 54:31.767
I'm a little bit confused. Are you applying
for an after school job or something?

54:31.769 --> 54:36.505
No, um... I'm applying as a
student to Whittman College, Eli.

54:36.507 --> 54:41.677
I thought you were 15. Have you
been lying to me about your age?

54:41.679 --> 54:45.614
I am 15, and I'm a high
school senior.

54:48.619 --> 54:50.753
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

54:50.755 --> 54:53.322
Because I thought you
wouldn't like it.

54:53.324 --> 54:58.694
And... why didn't you tell me about
the Collegiate Mastermind? Hm?

55:01.832 --> 55:04.466
Is is because you wanted to
keep your townie girlfriend...

55:04.468 --> 55:06.669
as far away from your real
life as you can?

55:06.671 --> 55:08.771
I'm a townie, too, you know.

55:08.773 --> 55:10.673
Then act like one.

55:13.577 --> 55:17.046
You better go get her, Eli. Girls
like that don't grow in chat rooms.

55:20.584 --> 55:22.484
And brush your hair.

56:00.891 --> 56:02.458
Shit!

56:07.765 --> 56:09.732
Dance.

56:14.438 --> 56:15.504
Good shot.

56:18.909 --> 56:21.944
Hey, Leo? How are
your testicles?

56:21.946 --> 56:23.846
Hanging in there.

56:25.850 --> 56:27.916
Yeah, you are.

56:39.630 --> 56:45.934
Pettifog. Pettifog.

56:45.936 --> 56:49.037
Pettifog!

56:49.039 --> 56:54.777
I am one gloomy dick, Pettifog.

56:56.947 --> 56:58.781
What's wrong?

56:58.783 --> 57:04.820
What's wrong? You got
suspended. We're gonna lose.

57:04.822 --> 57:07.423
Where'd you hear that?

57:07.425 --> 57:11.994
Everywhere.

57:11.996 --> 57:14.596
It's not true.

57:14.598 --> 57:17.733
It's not?

57:17.735 --> 57:24.673
No... it's-- it's a ruse to
lull the opponent.

57:24.675 --> 57:28.043
To a false sense of security.

57:28.045 --> 57:30.679
Nobody knows but you and me.

57:32.082 --> 57:34.116
That's just ingenious.

57:36.520 --> 57:43.926
So, you still guarantee complete
annihilation and total victory?

57:43.928 --> 57:46.128
100 percent.

57:46.130 --> 57:48.163
How about another 10?
That's 110 percent.

57:51.902 --> 57:54.102
There's no such thing.

57:54.104 --> 57:56.872
I don't care.

58:01.979 --> 58:05.914
Sophie?

58:07.718 --> 58:13.055
This was the car you were gonna
teach me to drive in.

58:17.595 --> 58:19.228
Well, why don't we do
that right now?

58:19.230 --> 58:21.797
I already know how to drive.

58:26.804 --> 58:30.839
You know I'm not really a
professor here, right?

58:30.841 --> 58:34.643
I know, you're a freshman.

58:34.645 --> 58:38.847
Which is 50-50 creepy to cool.

58:43.020 --> 58:45.153
I was sure you hated me, I--

58:45.155 --> 58:48.724
I did, until I saw you.

58:48.726 --> 58:54.730
But you're such a lost goofball,
I can't help but not hate you.

58:54.732 --> 58:56.999
Do you feel sorry for me?

58:57.001 --> 58:58.300
Yeah.

58:58.302 --> 59:01.303
Well, that's sweet.

59:01.305 --> 59:03.205
Are you thinking of
coming to Whittman?

59:03.207 --> 59:07.576
How would you feel about that?
I mean, it could be weird.

59:07.578 --> 59:14.082
Well... I don't know, thrilled that my daughter
is following after her scholarly father.

59:17.755 --> 59:18.954
What kind of grades you get?

59:18.956 --> 59:21.557
Straight A's. Yeah?

59:21.559 --> 59:23.892
It's no big deal, it's
public school.

59:23.894 --> 59:26.895
Still, that's great,
straight A's.

59:29.300 --> 59:31.066
Can you afford it?

59:31.068 --> 59:34.770
No, I can't afford it.

59:34.772 --> 59:37.773
Well, you know, maybe there's something
I can do to help you out tuition-wise.

59:37.775 --> 59:41.276
Are you serious? You
would do that?

59:41.278 --> 59:48.183
Yeah, um, I'm not making any promises,
but I'll see what I can do. Um...

59:48.185 --> 59:52.821
I didn't come here for that,
you know?

59:52.823 --> 59:56.091
I know, look, I know, I know,
I know. I know.

01:01:01.025 --> 01:01:03.058
Hi. Hi.

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:07.829
I can't see you anymore. I'm
sorry. Can I come in?

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:10.332
Yeah, why can't you
see me anymore?

01:01:10.334 --> 01:01:17.305
Well, because I just ran into my daughter
and I haven't seen her in a long time.

01:01:17.307 --> 01:01:21.743
And it's just a little
bit creepy...

01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:25.414
because she kind of looks
like-- you get it?

01:01:25.416 --> 01:01:27.949
That is so psychological.

01:01:27.951 --> 01:01:33.388
Some kind of pathological narcissistic
father-daughter disorder or something.

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:39.695
Well, thanks very much, and
I'll see you around campus.

01:01:39.697 --> 01:01:42.898
You sure you don't want to hang
out and study for a while?

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:49.404
Wow, um, uh... gosh,
I'm gonna go--

01:02:40.858 --> 01:02:45.393
Leo... what the hell are
you doing here?

01:02:45.395 --> 01:02:48.997
Hi, Benny, how are you?

01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:53.902
Well, I've got a lot of things I could complain
about, but try to say only good things.

01:02:53.904 --> 01:02:57.172
So, all right, what's
up with you?

01:02:57.174 --> 01:02:59.307
Oh, I'm here to place a bet,
Benny.

01:02:59.309 --> 01:03:02.444
Leo, you know that I'll never
take your bet, not ever.

01:03:02.446 --> 01:03:04.179
Now what kind of bookie
doesn't take a bet?

01:03:04.181 --> 01:03:07.015
The kind who feels guilty for
ruining your life.

01:03:07.017 --> 01:03:11.820
But this is a good bet. It's a
bet with conscience.

01:03:11.822 --> 01:03:14.055
Look, I'm sorry, Leo,
can't do it.

01:03:15.225 --> 01:03:18.059
Benny, take my bet.

01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:21.396
Would you please get up off the ground? The sight
of you down there is very disturbing to me.

01:03:21.398 --> 01:03:25.200
I'm not getting up until
you take my bet.

01:03:25.202 --> 01:03:27.469
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

01:03:27.471 --> 01:03:29.004
Oh, yeah? Hm.

01:03:29.006 --> 01:03:31.506
Really?

01:03:31.508 --> 01:03:34.376
I'm not getting up until you get
out of here, you understand?

01:03:34.378 --> 01:03:38.013
Look at you, Benny. You're on
your knees in your own office.

01:03:38.015 --> 01:03:42.117
Look at you, you're begging me to
ruin your life all over again.

01:03:42.119 --> 01:03:44.186
I'm trying to pay for my
daughter's tuition.

01:03:44.188 --> 01:03:46.154
Yeah.

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:48.290
Do you have any idea how much it
costs to go to college these days?

01:03:48.292 --> 01:03:50.192
I don't know, like 20 grand?

01:03:50.194 --> 01:03:51.993
Try 50 large.

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:54.462
50 large? Who the hell
can afford that?

01:03:54.464 --> 01:03:59.234
I got 25, if I double it, then
Sophie can go to school for a year.

01:03:59.236 --> 01:04:02.070
All right, what's the bet?

01:04:02.072 --> 01:04:04.239
Harvard to take it all.

01:04:04.241 --> 01:04:05.907
Harvard? What are
they gonna win?

01:04:05.909 --> 01:04:07.609
Collegiate Mastermind.

01:04:07.611 --> 01:04:09.611
What the hell is
Collegiate Mastermind?

01:04:09.613 --> 01:04:12.180
Well, it's kind of like Jeopardy,
but without the money.

01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:16.384
No money? What's the point?

01:04:16.386 --> 01:04:21.389
You are going to win the Collegiate
Mastermind National Championship. Say it.

01:04:21.391 --> 01:04:25.026
You are going to win the
Collegiate Mastermind--

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:28.964
Stop. Stop. Not me, you.
Please say it again.

01:04:28.966 --> 01:04:32.000
How can we win the Collegiate
Mastermind National Championship?

01:04:32.002 --> 01:04:35.503
We haven't answered one single
question during the whole season.

01:04:35.505 --> 01:04:37.906
Well, you didn't answer the questions,
but you knew the answers, right?

01:04:37.908 --> 01:04:39.908
I didn't.

01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:43.445
Not even one third of the answers?
One out of every three questions?

01:04:43.447 --> 01:04:47.515
I did, I knew about a third.

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:49.618
Yeah, I guess I did, too.

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:53.154
Okay, and Alan knew the other third, so
the three of you guys make up one of me.

01:04:53.156 --> 01:04:54.623
But--

01:04:54.625 --> 01:04:57.959
You're pussies. You guys
are total pussies.

01:04:57.961 --> 01:05:02.664
And pussies need balls, so get
some balls, guys.

01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:08.003
Can you seriously picture
Alan with balls?

01:05:08.005 --> 01:05:09.137
Mm?

01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:12.107
Eli.

01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:13.208
Alan?

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:15.911
Up here, Eli.

01:05:15.913 --> 01:05:19.447
Last night, I had a dream.

01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:22.450
The Poughkeepsie Music Hall...

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:27.656
Poughkeepsie, New York, semi-final
match of the Final Four...

01:05:27.658 --> 01:05:32.627
I was nailing question
after question.

01:05:32.629 --> 01:05:35.630
How did it end? In your triumph?

01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:37.565
Nope.

01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:42.704
Ended when I mutated into a rabbit
and shitted all over the stage.

01:05:42.706 --> 01:05:49.177
You weren't a rabbit, you
idiot. You were a Warring Hare.

01:05:49.179 --> 01:05:51.379
Really? Yes.

01:05:52.582 --> 01:05:54.582
But what does the shit signify?

01:05:54.584 --> 01:05:56.685
Purging of your doubts.

01:05:58.088 --> 01:06:02.357
Man... I got a lot of doubts.

01:07:08.025 --> 01:07:11.526
Because Harvard's burning.

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.795
Turn off the municipal
water system.

01:07:13.797 --> 01:07:15.663
Because Harvard's burning.

01:07:15.665 --> 01:07:17.399
Something smells good.

01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:22.337
Because Harvard's burning.

01:07:28.078 --> 01:07:29.177
We're here.

01:07:30.614 --> 01:07:31.813
Okay, now I'm nervous.

01:07:31.815 --> 01:07:33.415
I'm gonna try and get in anyway.

01:07:33.417 --> 01:07:35.250
Good luck to us all.

01:07:39.790 --> 01:07:42.157
Warren Harris from Leafy
Woman's College.

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:47.195
Searly, Leo.

01:07:47.197 --> 01:07:49.531
Pettifog, I can't let you in the
building until after the semi-finals.

01:07:49.533 --> 01:07:50.765
What are you talking about?

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:52.434
He's with us-- Excuse me.

01:07:52.436 --> 01:07:54.202
Okay, you're b--. What are
you talking about?

01:07:54.204 --> 01:07:56.271
I'll watch the guys. I can't
let you in. Sorry.

01:07:56.273 --> 01:07:58.173
There's something very
different about you this year.

01:07:58.175 --> 01:07:59.607
The moustache-- my
moustache came in.

01:07:59.609 --> 01:08:00.642
It's not your moustache.

01:08:00.644 --> 01:08:02.343
Moustache is in.

01:08:02.345 --> 01:08:04.746
Something I can't quite run
my fingers through.

01:08:04.748 --> 01:08:05.780
You know, Spencer--

01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:07.549
We're on, guys.

01:08:07.551 --> 01:08:08.550
I'm sorry, here we go.

01:08:13.457 --> 01:08:16.524
Ooh, we have arrived.

01:08:16.526 --> 01:08:19.560
Fruit plate.

01:08:19.563 --> 01:08:21.763
You know Shrek's wife Fiona?
Mm-hm.

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:24.365
I bet her hoo-hah looks
just like this.

01:08:24.367 --> 01:08:27.469
Why did it take you so long to
say something romantic?

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:31.206
Hey, guys, let's bring it in.
Huddle up... into a square.

01:08:34.111 --> 01:08:35.310
Circle, triangle, whatever.

01:08:35.312 --> 01:08:37.479
Are you gonna psyche us up
instead of Eli?

01:08:37.481 --> 01:08:43.184
In my own way. You made it to the Final
Four. You're already winners, right?

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:49.157
Right, right? Right. Let's take
a moment to cherish that.

01:08:55.599 --> 01:08:59.134
This is something that you're going
to share with your children.

01:08:59.136 --> 01:09:04.506
The foundation of good
character is based on losing.

01:09:04.508 --> 01:09:11.479
In fact, what makes a good
winner... is a good loser.

01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:20.522
What's the difference between
winning and losing?

01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:23.358
Except joy and pain.

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:28.863
So, let's go out there with our
heads held high... and lose one.

01:09:28.865 --> 01:09:31.198
In that old Whittman style.

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:35.236
We're coming to you live...
Coming to you live.

01:09:35.238 --> 01:09:37.538
...from the Poughkeepsie Music Hall
and what a beautiful venue this is.

01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:38.872
Gorgeous down there.

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:42.277
Where the Stanford Cardinal
will be taking on the--

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:44.612
Whittman Warring Hares of
Whittman College.

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:48.582
Who are playing without their
star, Eli Pettifog, who is--

01:09:48.585 --> 01:09:51.452
He's been suspended. He's been
suspended one game for showboating.

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:54.522
He's gonna be back if they
advance to the Finals.

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:56.257
What is up with you?

01:09:56.259 --> 01:09:58.826
This Whittman thong is itching
me something fierce.

01:09:58.828 --> 01:10:01.362
Can we have tickets? I
really need tickets.

01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:05.300
Shit! Shit.

01:10:13.944 --> 01:10:17.478
Why were you acting so
creepy in the library?

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:22.650
I don't know. Why were you
acting so creepy in the library?

01:10:25.222 --> 01:10:30.558
I just-- I just came over--

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.527
I'm sorry.

01:10:32.529 --> 01:10:34.295
Yeah, sorry.

01:10:38.468 --> 01:10:40.001
Oh, I have lip gloss.

01:10:40.003 --> 01:10:42.704
No, screw the lip gloss, okay?

01:10:49.879 --> 01:10:51.913
Yo, good luck, Stanford.

01:10:56.786 --> 01:11:00.755
Remember, guys, even without Pettifog,
the Hares are still dangerous.

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:06.427
Bullshit. Without Pettifog,
they can't even spell Pettifog.

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:10.498
Hey, watch the karma violation.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:14.602
Karma, karma, karma, karma,
karma chameleon.

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:17.672
You come and go.

01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:20.975
You come and go.

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:27.315
Oh, shit.

01:11:27.317 --> 01:11:31.419
Stanford Cardinal, please
report backstage to check in.

01:11:31.421 --> 01:11:34.689
Final call, final call,
Stanford Cardinal.

01:11:34.691 --> 01:11:37.292
We're currently waiting for the
Stanford Cardinal to arrive.

01:11:37.294 --> 01:11:40.561
I think it's a mind game. I think what
Stanford is doing is a mind game.

01:11:40.563 --> 01:11:44.565
I think they're just trying to upset these
Whittman Warring Hares by not showing up.

01:11:44.567 --> 01:11:46.834
I think it's bad karma, myself.
Yeah.

01:11:46.836 --> 01:11:49.570
I don't know where they are. I saw the
in the hotel this morning at breakfast.

01:11:49.572 --> 01:11:54.475
A little bleary-eyed, probably from studying
and/or partying they did last night.

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:56.611
But they look great,
these kids...

01:11:56.613 --> 01:11:59.013
we all shared some of the cottage cheese.
I got a bowl of cottage cheese there.

01:11:59.015 --> 01:12:00.982
Really?

01:12:00.984 --> 01:12:02.950
Put some sugar on it yourself and
grab yourself a pineapple ring...

01:12:02.952 --> 01:12:05.353
and put the cottage
cheese on there.

01:12:05.355 --> 01:12:08.923
And load that sucker with sugar and have
yourself some delicious French roast...

01:12:08.925 --> 01:12:11.659
that they have at the continental
breakfast, a croissant, maybe?

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:12.927
Right.

01:12:12.929 --> 01:12:15.430
Do not let them get into
your head, Gertrude.

01:12:15.432 --> 01:12:18.872
The match should have started 20 minutes ago.
Those Stanford fools are driving me crazy.

01:12:21.805 --> 01:12:24.505
Good afternoon, Whittman.

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:28.810
The Stanford Cardinal have failed
to appear... and are disqualified.

01:12:31.548 --> 01:12:36.551
Congratulations, you
advance to the Finals.

01:12:42.826 --> 01:12:45.693
<i>Benny Greenberg.</i>

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:50.698
Hi, Benny, it's me, it's Leo. Really
be good if I could talk to you.

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:54.369
Hey, so what's Eli's bedroom IQ?

01:12:54.371 --> 01:12:56.704
Cut it out, you jerks. Okay?

01:12:56.706 --> 01:13:00.041
Seriously, we're about to play
the match of our lives.

01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:01.709
What should we do?

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:03.811
We'll practice celebrating.

01:13:03.813 --> 01:13:06.748
Create a mental picture of
Harvard lying on the stage.

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:09.984
You know, they're crying,
they're fouling their pants.

01:13:09.986 --> 01:13:12.787
They're bleeding from
their ears...

01:13:12.789 --> 01:13:17.692
and you all are gyrating obscenely
over their fallen bodies. Okay?

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:22.897
I want some pie. You
want some pie?

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:24.899
Yeah.

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:29.070
Do you want blueberry? I heard they
have an awesome peach one. Banana--

01:13:29.072 --> 01:13:30.838
I actually have to pee.

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.841
Oh, I'll be over there.

01:13:41.518 --> 01:13:45.420
Dual vivimus vivamus.

01:13:45.422 --> 01:13:48.990
While we live, let's live.

01:13:48.992 --> 01:13:52.827
Porcellian Club, Harvard's
most secret society.

01:13:52.829 --> 01:13:56.931
Members often call it "The PC".

01:13:56.933 --> 01:14:03.738
And "The Porc". I'm not a member, so
I just call it the Porcellian Club.

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:10.545
Nobody is a member until they become a
member, but once a member, always a member.

01:14:10.547 --> 01:14:11.712
Like an alma mater.

01:14:15.452 --> 01:14:17.819
Only much, much better.

01:14:17.821 --> 01:14:20.087
Maybe next time around.

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:27.628
Look at me, Eli. There is no
next time around.

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:31.666
If you let Harvard win, I can
make you a Harvard student.

01:14:41.244 --> 01:14:43.778
Consider it.

01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:53.254
He said that if I take a dive in the final
match, I go to Harvard on a full scholarship.

01:14:53.256 --> 01:14:55.189
Does that include a
graduate degree?

01:14:55.191 --> 01:14:56.557
Who needs a graduate degree?

01:14:56.559 --> 01:14:57.992
Well, what was your answer?

01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:02.864
I didn't have one. I still
don't have one.

01:15:02.866 --> 01:15:08.603
I gotta go, just don't follow
me, don't try to find me, agh!

01:15:08.605 --> 01:15:11.138
I'm gyrating. I'm gyrating.

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.074
No, no, no, it's like this.

01:15:15.512 --> 01:15:19.046
You're the rice in my beans,
baby.

01:15:19.048 --> 01:15:20.815
Uh, hey, is Eli around?

01:15:20.817 --> 01:15:23.518
You guys don't know where he
is? Is something wrong?

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.119
Everything is fine. He's probably just
getting in the zone all by himself.

01:15:25.121 --> 01:15:26.954
What's going on? What's
going on, what?

01:15:26.956 --> 01:15:28.823
He's obviously not here. I
know he's not here.

01:15:28.825 --> 01:15:30.191
So let's go, let's go.

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:32.059
So, later.

01:15:55.018 --> 01:15:57.118
Eli? Eli.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.754
Eli. We should go back and wait
for him in the dressing room.

01:15:59.756 --> 01:16:02.056
What are you talking about? He's
not going to the dressing room.

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:04.325
He could be anywhere.

01:16:06.195 --> 01:16:09.597
We are live in Poughkeepsie,
New York...

01:16:09.599 --> 01:16:12.567
for the 49th annual Collegiate
Mastermind Tournament Championship.

01:16:12.569 --> 01:16:15.002
And right off the bat, we
have a shocker.

01:16:15.004 --> 01:16:16.804
Oh, boy.

01:16:16.806 --> 01:16:20.575
Whittman College's star player
Eli Pettifog is a no-show.

01:16:20.577 --> 01:16:24.011
I think that their chances have
gone from long shot...

01:16:24.013 --> 01:16:26.881
to no shot here against the
Harvard Crimson ruling elite.

01:16:31.821 --> 01:16:35.089
There.

01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:36.591
What are you doing, Eli?

01:16:36.593 --> 01:16:38.192
Eli.

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:41.596
He can't talk, but his Lego
skills are ridiculous.

01:16:41.598 --> 01:16:44.165
Hmm.

01:16:44.167 --> 01:16:46.233
Come on, let's go. The
match is starting.

01:16:49.305 --> 01:16:51.238
Keep on building.

01:16:53.676 --> 01:16:55.843
Holy shit, no Pettifog.

01:16:55.845 --> 01:16:58.312
Oh, no, I forgot to go
to the bathroom.

01:17:02.185 --> 01:17:04.952
Good afternoon, ladies
and gentlemen...

01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:08.889
and welcome to this year's Collegiate
Mastermind Championship Match.

01:17:08.891 --> 01:17:11.158
Featuring the Harvard Crimson.

01:17:16.399 --> 01:17:19.667
Against the Whittman
Warring Hare.

01:17:24.741 --> 01:17:27.675
The first question is a toss-up.

01:17:27.677 --> 01:17:32.647
When was the stethoscope
invented and by whom?

01:17:32.649 --> 01:17:33.714
1816 by.

01:17:33.716 --> 01:17:37.718
René-Théophile-Hyacinthe Laennec.

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:40.154
That is right.

01:17:40.156 --> 01:17:42.223
Here's your bonus.

01:17:42.225 --> 01:17:46.994
Despite her French-sounding name,
Marie Curie was from what country?

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:47.995
Poland.

01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:49.864
That is right.

01:17:51.834 --> 01:17:54.068
Here's a toss-up.

01:17:54.070 --> 01:18:00.041
Who was the only Major League pitcher
to throw a no-hitter while on LSD?

01:18:00.043 --> 01:18:01.676
Doc Ellis.

01:18:01.678 --> 01:18:03.778
That is correct.

01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:04.945
Where's Pettifog?

01:18:04.947 --> 01:18:06.781
Here's your bonus.

01:18:06.783 --> 01:18:10.351
What was the last country to
stop legally producing LSD?

01:18:10.353 --> 01:18:13.087
Czechoslovakia in 1975.

01:18:13.089 --> 01:18:15.356
That is right.

01:18:15.358 --> 01:18:19.193
This humiliation is
gonna go viral.

01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:24.932
It was Michigan in the semi-finals and now
it is a young, plucky band of kids...

01:18:24.934 --> 01:18:27.334
from Whittman College who are
feeling Harvard's wrath.

01:18:27.336 --> 01:18:30.004
Ugh, it's not pretty out there.

01:18:30.006 --> 01:18:34.709
I didn't think they had a
chance from the beginning...

01:18:34.711 --> 01:18:38.879
but now this sad Cinderella
story is coming to a close.

01:18:38.881 --> 01:18:42.450
Now the cards were stacked against
Whittman to begin with, even with...

01:18:42.452 --> 01:18:45.286
Eli? Eli!

01:18:45.288 --> 01:18:50.391
Excuse me, I made the decision that is
going to determine my future and yours.

01:18:50.393 --> 01:18:55.730
I reject friendship, I reject love,
and I reject Collegiate Mastermind.

01:18:55.732 --> 01:19:02.303
Iron Chef Michael Simon attended
which Cleveland area high school?

01:19:02.305 --> 01:19:05.272
Saint Edward High
School in Lakewood.

01:19:05.274 --> 01:19:07.274
That is right.

01:19:11.214 --> 01:19:14.882
Make it look like your
buzzers don't work.

01:19:14.884 --> 01:19:19.386
Toss up. What animal is
incapable of seeing the sky?

01:19:22.859 --> 01:19:25.392
I take it back.

01:19:25.394 --> 01:19:27.495
Five seconds, Whittman.

01:19:27.497 --> 01:19:30.965
Something in my head is saying gashon,
gashon, gashon. What the hell is gashon?

01:19:30.967 --> 01:19:34.802
It's a pig. The pig.

01:19:34.804 --> 01:19:36.504
That is right.

01:19:40.376 --> 01:19:42.910
Here's your bonus.

01:19:42.912 --> 01:19:47.815
These ancient people were sometimes accompanied
to the grave with their herds of pigs.

01:19:47.817 --> 01:19:51.952
The southern white cracker
loves his swine.

01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:57.525
The cracker is an ancient. Polish
people are true pig lovers.

01:19:57.527 --> 01:19:59.827
The Chinese!

01:19:59.829 --> 01:20:01.996
That is correct.

01:20:04.901 --> 01:20:07.001
Yeah! Uh-oh!

01:20:10.139 --> 01:20:15.142
The ugliest sight in the world is the
sight of simple people being happy.

01:20:15.144 --> 01:20:17.144
Toss up.

01:20:17.146 --> 01:20:23.884
What ill-fated computer platform was
released on the 23rd of April, 1983?

01:20:23.886 --> 01:20:25.586
The Apple 3.

01:20:25.588 --> 01:20:27.288
That is right.

01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:28.889
How did you know that?

01:20:28.891 --> 01:20:31.425
I didn't know I did.
Here's your bonus.

01:20:31.427 --> 01:20:36.230
Who was the forgotten founder of Apple and what
was his greatest contribution to the company?

01:20:36.232 --> 01:20:39.166
Ron Wayne, he designed
the first logo.

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:43.204
You nailed it!

01:20:43.206 --> 01:20:45.039
Yeah, Gertrude.

01:20:45.041 --> 01:20:46.540
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.

01:20:46.542 --> 01:20:50.244
Wow, a sign of life from
these Whittman Hares.

01:20:50.246 --> 01:20:52.580
Nah, I think it's gonna be too
little, too late, Spencer.

01:20:52.582 --> 01:20:55.983
Coming up on the two-minute warning, I
think Whittman's fate is all but sealed.

01:20:55.985 --> 01:20:58.352
Let's not get too excited yet...

01:20:58.354 --> 01:21:01.622
Harvard has been answering questions
like this for 500, 600 years.

01:21:01.624 --> 01:21:03.591
They could beat
Harvard without you.

01:21:09.498 --> 01:21:16.036
Toss up. Who performed the only instrumental
song to have been banned from American radio?

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:17.972
And what was the name
of the song?

01:21:22.511 --> 01:21:24.612
Holy spasticature.

01:21:24.614 --> 01:21:27.448
Oh! Down and out!

01:21:27.450 --> 01:21:30.317
I'll tell you, that's the most exciting moment
in Collegiate Mastermind history, that is.

01:21:30.319 --> 01:21:32.920
Wow, let's see that again.

01:21:32.922 --> 01:21:36.891
Here you go, hold it, wait for it.
He's gonna clip the podium right--

01:21:36.893 --> 01:21:39.660
Pow. Bing.

01:21:39.662 --> 01:21:42.496
That's gonna shave a few
points of the old GPA.

01:21:42.498 --> 01:21:47.534
Oh, don't you know it. He is a bleeder
that little kid, that smartie.

01:21:47.536 --> 01:21:54.174
Ladies and gentlemen, a member of the
Whittman side has sustained a serious injury.

01:21:56.112 --> 01:21:59.980
Whittman has three minutes to
produce their alternate.

01:21:59.982 --> 01:22:02.483
You're now the alternate, Eli.

01:22:02.485 --> 01:22:07.354
If you're not on that stage in three
minutes, Whittman will be disqualified.

01:22:07.356 --> 01:22:11.058
I'd stay where you are, Eli. A
king always needs his castle.

01:22:16.699 --> 01:22:23.704
Let me put it in context. How long
have you dreamed of going to Harvard?

01:22:23.706 --> 01:22:25.606
My whole life.

01:22:25.608 --> 01:22:30.577
How long have you dreamed of
beating Harvard?

01:22:30.579 --> 01:22:34.181
A couple of months.

01:22:34.183 --> 01:22:37.418
You're gonna have to honor
the big dream, Eli.

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:39.253
Yeah.

01:22:39.255 --> 01:22:42.456
Wait, what the hell
are you doing?

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:48.395
I mean, do you really want to screw your
school, your team and your friends?

01:22:48.397 --> 01:22:53.567
Get some balls, Eli, and go
out there and win it.

01:22:53.569 --> 01:22:57.371
It's his right. How's
your brain feeling?

01:23:04.013 --> 01:23:05.279
I can't do this.

01:23:05.281 --> 01:23:07.214
Get out there.

01:23:07.216 --> 01:23:10.084
I don't know what the fuck I'm
supposed to do, guys.

01:23:27.737 --> 01:23:29.770
Things just got interesting.

01:23:29.772 --> 01:23:33.173
Eli Pettifog, the Whittman Hares star
player just stepped out on the stage.

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:36.443
That boy has not missed a
question all season long.

01:23:36.445 --> 01:23:37.578
He has got brains.

01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:38.612
Yes.

01:23:38.614 --> 01:23:39.780
He's got hair.

01:23:39.782 --> 01:23:41.782
Where the hell have you been?

01:23:41.784 --> 01:23:42.783
You don't want to know.

01:23:42.785 --> 01:23:44.151
Yes, we do.

01:23:47.757 --> 01:23:53.394
Whittman has produced their
alternate, so let's resume.

01:23:53.396 --> 01:23:55.095
<i>Benny here.</i>

01:23:55.097 --> 01:23:57.097
Benny, it's me, it's Leo. Yeah?

01:23:57.099 --> 01:23:59.500
I want to take the bet back,
the Harvard bet?

01:23:59.502 --> 01:24:03.771
Leo, I never put the bet through. It
doesn't exist. You should be thanking me.

01:24:07.643 --> 01:24:11.412
Hey, Leo? You're welcome.

01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:16.550
Thank you, Benny.

01:24:16.552 --> 01:24:19.219
Toss up. Who said...

01:24:19.221 --> 01:24:25.392
"A whale ship was my Yale
College and my Harvard"?

01:24:28.097 --> 01:24:29.229
I can't, I can't.

01:24:29.231 --> 01:24:30.264
You better.

01:24:30.266 --> 01:24:31.665
Five seconds.

01:24:31.667 --> 01:24:33.100
Come on, guys.

01:24:33.102 --> 01:24:34.802
I would say Melville.
Then say it.

01:24:34.804 --> 01:24:37.538
Herman Melville.

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:38.772
That is right.

01:24:43.512 --> 01:24:48.782
For your bonus, at the time of his
death, Herman Melville was so obscure...

01:24:48.784 --> 01:24:51.685
the New York Times misidentified
him in his obituary.

01:24:51.687 --> 01:24:52.719
I know this.

01:24:52.721 --> 01:24:54.354
What name did they use?

01:24:54.356 --> 01:24:55.756
Henry Melville.

01:24:55.758 --> 01:24:57.658
That is right.

01:25:03.632 --> 01:25:06.700
Whittman! Go, Whittman!

01:25:08.471 --> 01:25:10.804
We have a tie score.

01:25:10.806 --> 01:25:13.307
I can't believe we're
tied with Harvard.

01:25:13.309 --> 01:25:15.109
I can't believe they're
tied with Harvard.

01:25:15.111 --> 01:25:18.779
I can't believe they're
tied with Harvard.

01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:26.820
This next question will
determine the championship.

01:25:26.822 --> 01:25:33.627
Toss up. Iceland and England broke
off diplomatic relations in 1976.

01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:36.597
What dispute caused the split?

01:25:42.838 --> 01:25:45.139
Do you know? No.

01:25:47.143 --> 01:25:49.143
20 seconds.

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:56.583
Dude, come on, Eli, set
yourself free, man.

01:26:03.225 --> 01:26:04.758
Ten seconds.

01:26:14.837 --> 01:26:16.670
Cod? Cod!

01:26:16.672 --> 01:26:18.739
Fishing.

01:26:18.741 --> 01:26:21.375
Rights!

01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:32.252
That is... right!

01:26:37.326 --> 01:26:42.863
It's unbelievable. Harvard goes
down! Harvard goes down!

01:26:42.865 --> 01:26:48.969
The Whittman Warring Hares are this year's
champions of the Collegiate Mastermind.

01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:53.941
We did it, you guys, we--

01:26:56.812 --> 01:26:58.779
Oh, my god.

01:26:58.781 --> 01:27:04.451
You are the greatest
unbelievable ever now!

01:27:04.453 --> 01:27:07.788
Go to the league office and tell
them we're getting the shaft.

01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:09.923
They wrote a whole rule book
for moments like this.

01:27:16.365 --> 01:27:17.431
How many stitches did you get?

01:27:17.433 --> 01:27:18.865
Seven.

01:27:18.867 --> 01:27:20.667
Can I take them out when
they're ready?

01:27:20.669 --> 01:27:21.702
Yeah.

01:27:23.439 --> 01:27:25.339
Nice brain.

01:27:25.341 --> 01:27:26.807
You see this brain? Yeah.

01:27:26.809 --> 01:27:28.775
My left ball is bigger
than this brain.

01:27:28.777 --> 01:27:31.945
That's why you're so artistic.

01:27:56.772 --> 01:28:02.276
Shauna, get in the picture.
Yeah, Shauna.

01:28:02.278 --> 01:28:09.316
Yo, Pettifog, tell us how
awesome we are!

01:28:09.318 --> 01:28:12.019
Stop, stop, I'll do the speech.
I'll do a speech.

01:28:12.021 --> 01:28:16.590
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:28:16.592 --> 01:28:24.498
I, uh... I'm afraid I have some unpleasant
business regarding today's final.

01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:28.635
According to Rule 324 of the
book of Collegiate Mastermind...

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:33.440
An injured player cannot be replaced with
less than one minute remaining in a match.

01:28:33.442 --> 01:28:37.577
The team must complete the
match with two players.

01:28:37.579 --> 01:28:41.648
Today Whittman College
broke that rule.

01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:47.321
I'm sorry to have to tell you
that Harvard College...

01:28:47.323 --> 01:28:50.057
is this year's Collegiate
Mastermind champion.

01:28:57.333 --> 01:28:59.866
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:29:10.412 --> 01:29:13.747
We all know what happened today.

01:29:13.749 --> 01:29:19.553
We beat Harvard fair and square.

01:29:19.555 --> 01:29:23.490
But they stole it from us.

01:29:23.492 --> 01:29:26.560
Do you know why?

01:29:26.562 --> 01:29:30.364
Because they fear us.

01:29:30.366 --> 01:29:35.869
We're the beautiful bums. We're
the people's champions.

01:29:42.611 --> 01:29:46.546
So let us be history's secret.

01:30:39.868 --> 01:30:43.770
Are you sure I can do this? I'm
not even a student yet.

01:30:45.507 --> 01:30:49.843
Don't worry, you're with me.

01:30:49.845 --> 01:30:51.611
Ring it.

01:31:17.773 --> 01:31:18.385
Leo? Leo?

01:31:35.224 --> 01:31:37.958
Where's he going?

01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:39.526
Let's go down.

01:31:39.528 --> 01:31:45.198
Hey, Leo! Where are you going?

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:47.601
Going back to being a civilian.

01:31:47.603 --> 01:31:49.603
You're not a civilian.

01:31:49.605 --> 01:31:54.274
Gonna get a job. I'm gonna pay
for my daughter's education.

01:31:54.276 --> 01:32:01.214
And I'm going to find an
age-appropriate fox, and I mean that.

01:32:04.853 --> 01:32:08.054
It's been a pleasure making bad
decisions with you.

01:32:08.056 --> 01:32:11.258
I'll miss you, too.

01:32:28.744 --> 01:32:31.177
Take care. Cut your hair.

01:32:55.003 --> 01:32:57.837
Please don't cut your hair.

01:32:57.839 --> 01:33:02.576
Of course, I won't. It
protects my brain.

01:33:03.745 --> 01:33:05.946
What did you say?

01:33:05.948 --> 01:33:09.215
Nothing.

01:33:26.201 --> 01:33:29.269
Excuse me.

01:33:46.755 --> 01:33:47.754
Uh, Miss?
